YOU MAY DO SO AT THAT POINT RIGHT MS WICKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SIX IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT WILL CODIFY THE TERMS DONOR ADVISED FUNDS OR DEATHS. AND SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS AND ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH A CLASSIFICATION FOR SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAINTAIN ONE OR MORE DEATHS. STAFFS ALLOWED IT ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT TO WHICH THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN MAKE A TAX DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTION TO A TERRIBLE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION. THE DONOR THAN RECOMMENCE GRANTS FROM HIS OR HER FUND OTHER CHARITY CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE DIRECT BENEFITS THROUGH COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS OR ADVOCACY. NATIONALLY DAFT HOLD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND DONATED TERRIBLE ASSETS. OF WHICH ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION IS HELD IN DEATH SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THESE TERRIBLE DEDUCTIONS ACOSTA ST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY CONSERVATIVELY. FOR THEIR MONEY STOCK OR OTHER ASSETS THAT A DONOR CAN DONORS CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR DEATHS. HOWEVER THESE FUNDS CONCERT INDEFINITELY WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY PUBLIC CHARTER WILL BENEFIT THE PUBLIC POLICY CONVERSATION ON DEATHS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE A PHILANTHROPIC TOOLS THAT IS THAT ARE GROWING IN POPULARITY AND THAT A LOT OF COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS AND THEIR COMMERCIAL COUNTERPARTS ARE CURRENTLY USING TO FUND GOOD WORK. FOR EXAMPLE THEIR NUMBER OF COPA NINETEEN REALLY FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP AS STAFF TO HELP PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT AS I MENTIONED MONEY CONCERT IN TAOS INDEFINITELY AND NOTHING IN STATURE REQUIRES THE FUNDS TO BE DISPERSED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS TO REPORT THEY'RE GIVING. BUT THE AGGREGATED TOTALS REPORT DO NOT TRANSLATE INTO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR EACH TAX DEDUCTION THAT TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA GENERAL FUND. HOWEVER THE OVERALL EFFICACY. OF CALIFORNIA TRIP ORGANIZATIONS ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IS A LARGER POLICY QUESTION THAT AB TWENTY AND THIRTY SIX DOES NOT PRESUME TO ANSWER. THIS BILL SIMPLY HAD INFORMATION ABOUT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT CODE TELL WAS DELISH BASELINE. BASELINE FROM WHICH TO START ENGAGING ON ON THE AFTER MENTIONED BROADER POLICY CONVERSATION. I HAVE MY WITNESSES SELF INTRODUCED AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE TO WITNESSES I WOULD LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. STONE HERE.

LURK FOUNDER AND BOARD CHAIR OF BENEFICIAL STATE BANK AND IMPACT INVESTOR AND ACTIVE DONOR ADVISED FUNDS HOLDER AND PHILANTHROPIST WHO HAS TAKEN THE GIVING PLEDGE WITH MY HUSBAND TO GIVE AWAY THE MAJORITY OF OUR WEALTH DURING OUR LIFETIME. YOUR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND ADDS A SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SIX. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE COULD BUILD SIMPLY REQUIRED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH A CLASSIFICATION FOR ORGANIZATION WHO MAINTAIN DONOR ADVISED FUNDS OR DATA. GAPS ARE CURRENTLY NOT DEFINED IN CALIFORNIA STATUTE. PARTMINER FINANCE LAST WEEK THANK KNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA FACES BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THAT COULD PROMPT DEVASTATING CUTS FOR SCHOOL HEALTH CARE AND SAFETY NET PROGRAM. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS APPROACH GREAT DEPRESSION LEVEL WE FACE POTENTIAL REFER TO THE VIRUS AT THE STRATEGIC RE OPENING OF OUR ECONOMY GETS UNDER WAY. THE PANDEMIC IS PUTTING A MICROSCOPE ON THE ROLE OF PHILANTHROPY ATTY. WORDS OF THIS BILL ARE A PART OF A GROWING MOVEMENT TO HOLD THE DONOR ADVISED FUND TOOL ACCOUNTABLE AND TAXPAYERS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT DAY AFTER PRODUCING SOCIETAL BENEFIT THE REFLECT THE SCALE OF NEED AND THEREFORE. MERIT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR OF CALIFORNIA'S REVENUES FOR GONE THROUGH CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS FOR GAP CONTRIBUTIONS. NATIONWIDE THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS HELD IN DOUBT. THE VAST MORE MAJORITY OF WHICH IT IDLE WHILE PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN BASIC SERVICES LIKE FOOD AND HEALTH CARE. THE FIDELITY CHARITABLE GIFT FUND THE NATION'S LARGEST THAT MONSTER AND LARGEST QUOTE CHARITY PROBABLY HIGHLIGHT READING POINTED TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARD COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE. COMMENDABLE BUT ACCOUNT FOR ONLY THREE QUARTERS OF 1% OF THEIR THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL THAT ACT THAT. BLACK YOUR FIDELITY TERRIBLE MADE AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PROFITS ADAPT UNDER THEIR MANAGEMENT. FINANCIAL STRUCTURE PASSED INCENTIVIZE ORGANIZATIONS TO KEEP SIGNIFICANT ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN ORDER TO EARN MORE IN MANAGEMENT FEES NOT TO GET DOLLARS OUT THE DOOR TO NONPROFIT PROVIDING IT WILL BENEFIT FROM THE GROUND. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE SUPPORTED LAST WEEK THAT THE OPENING NATURE OF STAFF REPORTING. OUT FOR ME. VIEW. THAT DOOR MAGICALLY. CALIFORNIA SURE THAT THE DOOR THEIR LEVERAGE THE PROGRAM LEAGUE AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SIX TAKE MALIK STEP BUT A CRITICAL IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I HOW ASK YOU TO THE THIS MODEST BUT- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE. MISTER DRUMMOND PIE. HM STONE AND THEN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DRUM AND PIKE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX I FOUNDED THE TIDES FOUNDATION AND SERVED AS ITS CEO FOR THIRTY FIVE LONG YEARS- HAVING SOME OF THE WONDERS OF THE HONORED BY FUNDS- CAN CREATE AND SOME OF THE ABUSES TO WHICH SOME HAVE PUT THEM. NONPROFITS OPERATE WITHIN CATEGORIES ESTABLISHED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE TAX REFORM ACT THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS AND PUBLIC CHARITIES THE PRIMARY FACTORS SEPARATING THE TWO WITH THE DEGREE OF DONOR CONTROL OVER THE ASSETS AND DISTRIBUTIONS PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS ARE CHARITIES WERE THE DONOR RETAINS CONTROL THEY ARE MORE CLOSELY REGULATED IN GRANTED SMALLER LEVELS OF DEDUCTION. IMPORTANTLY THEY ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ANNUAL DESCRIPTIONS ROUGHLY 5% OF THEIR ASSETS. PUBLIC CHARITIES ARE THE OTHER HAND SEEM TO BE GOVERNED BY A BROADLY REPRESENTATIVE BOARD AND DEMONSTRABLY HAD DEMONSTRABLY LARGE NUMBERS OF DONORS THIS WAS TRU OF MOST OPERATING CHARITIES AND COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AT THE TIME. BECAUSE DONORS RELINQUISH CONTROL THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS WERE AFFORDED HIGHER DEDUCTIBILITY AND MORE LATITUDE IN THE USE OF FUN. PUBLIC CHARITIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS AND ONLY REPORT ON SUCH IN AGGREGATE. IN PRACTICE. AS PRACTICES EVOLVED OVER THE PAST FIFTY YEARS. TELEVISED FUNDS HAVE SERVED AS A WORKAROUND TO PROVIDE DONORS WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF GIFTS TO PUBLIC CHARITIES WHILE EFFECTIVELY ALLOWING THEM TO CONTROL GRANT MAKING AND MANAGEMENT OF THE ASSETS. THEY RECEIVE HIGHER DEDUCTIBILITY OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE AVOID GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY THAT PRIVATE FOUNDATION STATUS WOULD REQUIRE. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SIX IS IMPORTANT FOR TWO REASONS ONE IT WILL RAISE THE VISIBILITY OF C. HINTON DAU S. AND THEIR SPONSORS AND HOW THEY OPERATE INTO SUCH REPORTING COULD REVEAL WHETHER THE CONDITION OF PUBLIC CHARITIES THIS ARE EFFECTIVELY BEING MET. AND WHETHER SOME NUMBER OF DONOR ADVISED FUND SIMPLY DO NOT MAKE ANY GRANTS AT ALL FOR. YEARS WE KNOW THE ACCOUNTING IS DONE BY SPONSORS THAT IS. DON'T NOT FOR THEM THE REVISED CAN BE VERY POSITIVE THING BUT HAVE SEEN THE CAN ALSO MINUTES THE SKIRT PUBLIC PURPOSE THAT JUSTIFIES THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT OF LOS TAX REVENUE FOR THAT'S WHAT IT REALLY IS. MORE VISIBILITY WILL ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO FULLY EVALUATE THE COST BENEFIT OF THAT DONOR ADVISED FUND INVESTMENT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU. SO IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO OFFER TESTIMONY SUPPORT THE BILL. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE ON THE LINE WHO WISH TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND STATE THEIR POSITION. ON THE BILL. IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE GATHER THE INFORMATION FROM THE FIRST LINE. OKAY. SO WE'RE WAITING FOR THE RIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. CAN LINE FIFTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THE CARD IN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ADVOCATION IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THE TIME WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SIX WE HAVE JAMES HEAD FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. ON THE TELEPHONE MR HEAD. ONE EIGHT AND YOU HAVE ME. YES. THANK YOU- GERMAN STONE MY NAME IS JAMES HEAD AND I'M THE PRESIDENT CEO AT THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND I'M ALSO BOARD CHAIR OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDED FOUNDATION. THE LEAGUE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILLBECAUSE THE THING THE THING UP OUT DON ADVICE ON SOME OTHER GIVING WHO'S BUT JUST PRIVATE FOUNDATION. AND OUT MEANT AND TERRIBLE TRUST. IN A WAY THAT WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON COMMUNITY- PHILANTHROPY AT THE SAME MOMENT IT IS MOST NEEDED BY SOUTH OF THE NONPROFIT ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE'LL GET THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NEW WITH ALREADY TO REGULATE THAT. AND DOES NOT LIMIT WHAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THE EIGHTY CHEMICAL MEANT WILD WITH THAT NEW AUTHORITY. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL PERMITS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ISSUE CLASSIFICATIONS BUT TRY. ANOTHER RELATIONSHIPS CONCERNING PROPERTY HELP A PURPOSE. BUT ALTHOUGH NATURE OF ASSETS DURATION OF THE TRUST THE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS. AMOUNT OF AT THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE DEVOTED TO CHARITABLE PURPOSE% AND OTHERS. AND WE FEEL THAT THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT BOTH PHONE DWN AS WELL IN THAT TO CREATE. ON A FIVE FUNDING CALIFORNIA. BUT BUILT UPON HAVE NOT MADE AN EVIDENCE THEY HATE THAT THERE THE PROBLEM TO BE FIXED. AT THE AT THE BAY ASSET THAT THEY- THAT INDICATE THAT THAT THERE'S A NEED BUT A ADDITIONAL GRANT THINKING FROM DON AT FIVE FIVE. I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU WHAT- DONNA BY PLAINTIFF DONE ESPECIALLY IN THAT MISSION UP BUT COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AS AN EXAMPLE. IN TWENTY NINETEEN PAYOUT RATES BUT ON IT BY FUNDS HOPE THAT BY THE MEMBERS HAVE IT'S MORE THAN FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE MANDATE IT PAID OUT. OF PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT THAT THE BUT THE ONLY RATHER THAN THE FLOOR. BY APRIL THIRTIETH COBRA RELIEF FUND HOSTED BY THE NUMBER OF RATE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AFFORDABLE MILLION DOLLARS. MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THAT DIRECTED BUT DON IT BY SPOT. AND I'VE ALREADY DEPLOYED OVER 40% OF BOTH FIND THE NONPROFIT- EIGHTEEN HUNDRED GRANT. EVERYTHING OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. DONE ADVISED PLAN% HOLDERS AT AT AT BIG MEMBER FOUNDATION INCREASE THEIR THEIR REGULAR GIVE ME BY BUT THIRTY TWO PERCENT. AND MARK IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR. AND YET THIS MONTH MULTIPLE FUND HOLD IT AT THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION GRANTED OVER 90% OF THAT DOWN IF I FIND THE RESPONSE TO THE COLD BUT CRIED THAT. OVERALL THE DONOR ADVISED FUND GRANT MAKING THIS MARKET APRIL FROM THAT YOU TAKE ME FOUNDATION IT UP ALL COSTA YEAR. THE LEAGUE BELIEVE THERE IS A NEED FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND HOW DON'T ADVISE BOND A CONTRIBUTING TO THE LAMP BUT THE- AND TO SERVICE BUT THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. HI BUT WE DO NOT THINK THAT THE BILL THAT THE WAY TO DO SO. WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE DONE AT THE BIO. TECH TO MEET AND COLLABORATE WITH THE NONPROFIT SECTOR TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS CRIME BECAUSE LIKE HOPE IT NINETEEN. BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER CRACKED WITH THAT AND- AND PRACTICES WITHIN A CALIFORNIA THAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. I WOULD THAT I'D LIKE TO NOW I HAVE BY COLLEAGUES IN THE CUT THEIR- ALSO- SPEAK ABOUT. A CALIFORNIA LEAVE OUT BASIS EXPERIENCE WITH ON ADVISED BY. LINDA ALL RIGHT BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT TO REMIND. PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE PHONE WHEN YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING PLEASE MUTE YOUR PHONE. SO THAT WE DON'T GET ANY ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. ALL RIGHT WE DO HAVE LINDA BEACH CUTLER. ALSO AS A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION THIS COLOR. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR OF MY NAME IS LINDA CUTLER AND I AM THE CEO OF THE SACRAMENTO REGION COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. LEAGUE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT AIMS TO CARVE OUT A SPECIAL CLASSIFICATION FOR DONOR BY FUNDS TO SINGLE THEM OUT FROM OTHER GIVING TOOL SH AND THEREFORE THE BILL OPENS THE DOOR TO ANY MANNER OF NEW RECORDING BURDENS ON COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS IN THE FUTURE. THIS WILL DISCOURAGE COMMUNITY PHILANTHROPY AND ENCOURAGE DONORS TO LAUNCH MORE PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS WITH HIGHER ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. AND LOWER PAY OUT RATE AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE NEED DOLLARS FLOWING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES MAPS. I ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL. THE AG WE ARE. HAVE FORTY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT THE BILL PROPOSED IT. IF THIS IS THE CASE AND A TIME OF FISCAL AUSTERITY WHY ADD DUPLICATIVE AUTHORITY AND OPEN THE DOOR TO A NEW REGULATORY BURDEN ON COMMUNITY FOUNDATION. A COMMON REFRAIN FROM THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL IS THAT WE NEED NEW REGULATIONS TO MAKE SURE. THAT GAPS ARE THAT MONEY FROM DAFT ARE FLOWING TO THE COMMUNITY AS THE BILL- ANALYSIS ITSELF STATE MANY DONORS DO DIRECT CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BASS TO CHARITY. SHORTLY AFTER MAKING THE INITIAL DONATION. THIS IS TRUE AND NORMAL TIMES FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO ARE TYPICAL PAYOUT RATES EXCEED FIFTY PERCENT. BUT THIS IS MORE TRUE AND A CRISIS- GRANT MAKING FROM OUR DONOR ADVISED FUNDS IN SACRAMENTO WAS COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR. AT THE AT THE PROJECT ME FOUNDATION THAT BACK GAS GRANT MAKING WAS THAT NINETY SIX PERCENT. AND MONTEREY COUNTY WAS A 194% SAN FRANCISCO WAS UP MENTIONED IN THE EAST BAY IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE PERCENT. IN ADDITION TO THE DEATHS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF SACRAMENTO AND- MARCH APRIL ANOTHER MILLION AND GAS WERE WERE MADE TO SUPPORT OUR ANNUAL DAY OFGIVING LAST BIG DAY OF GIVING LAST THURSDAY. WHICH REYES NEARLY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SACRAMENTO AREA NONPROFIT MORE THAN A 40% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR. THE GENEROSITY OF OUR FUND HOLDERS LAST WEEK IT'S JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF HOW FLEXIBLE AND IMPACTFUL DON'T HURT BY FUNDS ARE. BOTH IS GIVING TOOL FOR OUR DONORS AND RESOURCES ARE. NONPROFIT AS YOU. HAS SHOWN THAT MY THE MOST HIS BILL RESOURCE FOR NOW. DURING THE FOR THREE REASONS THE DOWNEY ARE MADE THE RELATIONS WITH NON PROFITS ARE ALREADY BUILT AND GAPS MAKE IT EASY AND FAST FOR DONORS TO GATHER. AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE NEXT WILD PARTIES AND WE KNOW THE READY TO DEPLOY RESOURCES AND DONOR ADVISED FUNDS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE PHILANTHROPIC LIFEBLOOD. SO OUR HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES. BUT MARKETS WE CONTINUE TO CATCH THE STATION ON A TOOL USED BY SO MANY GENEROUS CALIFORNIANS FOR STRATEGIC LONG TERM GIVING IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE LEAGUE AND ITS THIRTY NUMBER. NATIONS SPPORT POLICIES THAT INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES. AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL WILL DO THE OPPOSITE. AT A TIME WHEN CHARITABLE GIVING IS MOST NEEDED. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW'S THE TIME FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AND STATE THEIR OPPOSITION. TO AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY SIX IS THERE.

FOR A GROUP NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE BRING UP WELL IT'S GOING TO COST US MONEY. WELL LAST I CHECKED JUSTICE SHOULDN'T BE COMING WITH A DOLLAR SIGN ON IT AS TO HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST YOU IT'S EITHER JUST FOR ITS NOT. AND IS NOT JUST TO ALLOW THE- THESE GROUPS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE PUBLIC IN JUST BECAUSE THE STATE MIGHT HAVE LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE UC HAS AN INSURANCE POLICY AND I THINK VERY MUCH VERY MUCH OF. THESE CLAIMS SHOULD COME OUT OF THEIR BUDGETS AND THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES BUT CERTAINLY THE STATE DOES HAVE RISK BUT THAT THAT COMES WITH OPERATING STATE GOVERNMENTS AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE DONE WRONG AS IS VERY CLEAR IN THIS CASE. IN THE CASE OF UCLA AND I AND I DON'T KNOW IT. THE OTHER CONCERN I WOULD SAY IS RIGHT NOW ARE ONLY FOCUSING ON ONE. AND MAYBE AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THAT'S- YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE FOCUSING ON UCLA BUT I THINK EVERY PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. THAT DID THESE KIND OF THINGS WHEN THEY WERE COMPLAINTS FILED INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE NOT SHARED WERE HEADS WERE TURNED THE OTHER WAY AND THEREBY VICTIMS- STATUES LIMITATIONS PASSED. JUSTICE REQUIRES THAT THEY FACE THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE EXTENSION AND THE ABILITY TO BRING THEIR CLAIMS. THEIR RIGHTFUL CLAIMS. AGAIN SEIZE ENTITIES AND JUST BECAUSE OUR PUBLIC IT MIGHT COST THE STATE MONEY. SHOULD NOT BE A JUSTIFICATION TO STOP THAT. AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO MAYBE SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. WELL AT MISTING X. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND I CERTAINLY THINK- IN ANY TIME IF SOMEONE'S IN A POSITION OF POWER IN ABUSING THAT POWER THE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND THE VICTIMS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES NEED TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY WORK FOR. I THANK YOU MISTER. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE TWO WITNESSES FOR COMING FORWARD TODAY TO A TESTIFIED MUST BE A VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO RELIEVE YOUR- TO A TRAUMA SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE KID OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE RIGHT SYNONYMOUS WITH TO MAKE CLOTHES THANK YOU I THINK- MY WITNESSES AND CAPS LATE THE NEED FOR THIS BILL ON WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA TAKES. MARK STONE HI. STONE HI GALLAGHER. THE OLDER I CHAU SHALL I TO- TO BUY AND SALAS HOLDEN KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE. RAY IS REYES I. IT HAS SEVEN BUT RIGHT THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU AND NOW WILL MOVE TO AB THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES WORKS THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WILL IF ANYBODY WANTS TO CALL IN ON AB THIRTY TO SIXTY THIS IS NOW YOUR OPPORTUNITY. GREAT THANK LAST PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST. IN NEARLY ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIANS HAVE FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT WITH MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS WONDERING WHERE THEIR NEXT PAYCHECK WILL COME FROM. MYSTERY MISSED RENT PAYMENTS ARE PILING UP AND EVICTIONS ARE INEVITABLE ONCE GOVERNOR NUISANCE EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING EVICTIONS. FICTION PROCEEDINGS FOR NINETY DAYS IS LIFTED. IN YOUR OWN ANALYSIS ON PAGE FOUR THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE MAY SEE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IF NOT MILLIONS FACING EVICTIONS. AND WHAT IS THAT GOING TO MEAN FOR OUR TENANT COMMUNITY AND OUR LAND LORD COMMUNITY. FOR RENTERS TRAINING THEIR SAVINGS ON ENVIRONMENTAL. FOR RENTERS READING THEIR SAVINGS ON EMERGENCY RELATED EXPENSES. THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE MONEY LEFT. TO PAY UP FRONT COST TO SECURE HOUSING. LIKE A SECURITY DEPOSIT. EXISTING LAWS FOR MIDDLE AND LOWER TO REQUIRE TWO MONTHS RENT A SECURITY FOR AN UNFURNISHED RENTAL PROPERTY. OR THREE MONTHS RENT AS AS AS SECURITY FOR FINISH RENTAL PROPERTY. THE AVERAGE RENDON OAKLAND IS THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF EXISTING LAW ALLOWS WHEN THEY'RE TO CHARGE UP TO THREE MONTHS' RENT A SECURITY DEPOSIT. THIS MEANS A RENTER COULD POTENTIALLY PAY UP TO NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN UP FRONT COSTS. PRE PANDEMIC FORTY THOUSAND. 40% OF AMERICANS NOT HAVE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. WITH OVER THREE POINT FIVE MILLION RESIDENTS UNEMPLOYED IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THAT TENANTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD RENT. AND EXHAUST WHATEVER'S LEFT THEIR SAVINGS ALL SHELTER IN ORDER PLACES ARE ENACTED. IN ORDER TO DELIVER UP FRONT MOVE IN COST RELIEF AB THIRTY TO SIXTY REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO PROVIDE TENANTS WITH THE CHOICE OF THE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING. THEIR SECURITY DEPOSIT IN FULL WHICH IS THE CURRENT LAW. IN ONE IMMEDIATE PAYMENT. THE SECOND OPTION WOULD BE- SIX MONTHS SIX PAYING OVER SIX MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS UNLESS THE TERM OF THE LEASE IS LESS THAN NINE MONTHS IN WHICH CASE THE NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS WOULD BE IN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT OR PURCHASE SECURE DEPOSIT INSURANCE OR ASSURE THE BOND. THE BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND ALTERNATIVES INDIVIDUALS WELL FAMILIES. AND FAMILY SWELLED NOT DISADVANTAGING PROPERTY OWNERS. AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH MANY OF YOU ABOUT THIS BILL AND IT- DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS HEARING. INCLUDING CONVERSATIONS WITH MISS REYES- WHERE I HAVE AGREED TO WORK WITH HER ON HOW WE ADDRESS- MONTH TO MONTH LEASES BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT'S A SEPARATE CATEGORY- AND I'VE ALSO LOOKED AT. DEEPLY THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS AND THERE ARE SOME. LEARNINGS I THINK WE CAN TAKE FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE- WHICH I'LL BE EXPLORING THOSE MOMENTS OF ALSO THIS IS VERY MUCH STILL WORK IN PROGRESS BILL. BUT IT'S A BILL THAT IS INTENDED TO. ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE FINANCIAL BURDEN THAT RENTERS HAVE WILL STILL PROTECTING LAMB OR TO THE SAME TIME A GIVEN THE CRISIS THAT WERE ABOUT TO BE FACED WITH. AND I WOULD THE. I'M SORRY- SO THE BILL SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIA BE. A SORRY SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA BE. THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. I'D ASK- LOUISE CIMARRON DAY FROM CALIFORNIA BE TESTIFYING ASKED SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT MYSTERON SAY WHO'S HERE IN PERSON. PLEASE ONE OF THE MIKE PICKED ME UP. FROM HERE YES OKAY. A GOOD MORNING- THIS RICHARD THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY TO SUPPORT AB THIRTY SIX THE MOTHER THE TREMENDOUS CRISIS NUMBER SETTING THE STATE WHEN I'M SURE IS AN IMMEDIATE PRESSURE ON YOUR PERSONAL TIME. MY NAME IS LOUIS MONTANA LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA BE- KEEPING MY REMARKS BRIEF BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. HOW CALIFORNIA BE ADVOCATES FOR AN END TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS- ONE ROUND NOW RENDERED IN STARK CLARITY BIKE OF THE NINETEEN. SB THIRTY TO SIXTY HELPS US ADVANCE OUR MISSION BY GIVING FINANCING OPTION FOR A COMPLY. WITH THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A DOWN PAYMENT. THE CIVIC WERE MOST EXCITED ABOUT THE ON. TO PAY FOR SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR PAYMENT PLAN. AS PART OUT OVER SIX MONTHS. CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF A SECURITY DEPOSIT AT THE END OF THE LEASE SO MANY TENANTS ARE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THEIR NEW SECURITY DEPOSIT. WELL THEIR PREVIOUS LANDLORD HOLDS THE PREVIOUS DEPOSIT INSURE THAT THE UNIT IS RETURNED IN A CONDITION IN WHICH IT WAS LEAST. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW TENANTS TO USE THEIR PREVIOUS DEPOSIT TO PAY FOR SOME OF THEIR NEW DEPOSIT WITH GREATER EASE. THROUGH THE REPAYMENT PLAN. I CAN TELL YOU THAT AMONG OUR STAFF INVOLVED. THIS BILL IS A LIST OF PARTICULAR EXCITEMENT ONE OF OUR CURRENT STUFF MEMBERS RECENT GRADUATE OF UC BERKELEY. EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WILL STAND THERE. TODAY HE IS ONE OF OUR MOST VALUABLE TEAM MEMBERS. BUT IN COLLEGE HE WAS ALMOST UNABLE TO FIND HOUSING FOR A LARGE PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN THE BALANCE IS FROM THE PRESSURES OF STUDYING. WORKING FULL TIME AND MOVING TO A NEW AREA OF CALIFORNIA. WELL LIVING ON THE COUCHES OF FRIENDS AND IN THIS CAR. IN HIS OWN WORDS. THE REASON WHY I WAS ALMOST IN THE BAY AREA FOR SO LONG WAS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH SECURITY DEPOSITS. AND THE FIRST MONTH RUN REQUIREMENT. FOR MOST FAIRY APARTMENTS. THIS BILL HELPS RELIEVE THE PRESSURE THAT MANY IN CALIFORNIA. SUCH AS MY COWORKER MOHAMMED FIXED. FOR THAT REASON CALIFORNIA BE URGES YOUR SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TO SIXTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WAS THERE ANYONE. ON THE PHONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TO SIXTY. TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN YOU'RE ON YOUR PHONE. ONE MOMENT PLEASE ALL GATHER INFORMATION FROM THE FIRST LINE. THANK SEVENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS TRYING TO GOT TO ON BEHALF OF THEIR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. LINE EIGHTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MORE INCLINED TO THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA QUIRK. THANK YOU. AT THE TIME THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT CAN CUTE OKAY WILL THEN MOVE TO OPPOSITION. AND WE HAVE RUN KINGS THAT HERE IN PERSON TO. GIVE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTY TO SIXTY. BUT PLEASE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AROUND KINGSTON I REPRESENT- SERVER REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS IN THE BAY AREA ORANGE COUNTY RIVERSIDE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- AS WELL AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING MANAGEMENT- SO SEE ASIANS WHICH ARE HAVE TO CREDIT QUALIFIED AND HAVE VERY LIMITED. TENANTS OF QUALIFY FOR THAT TYPE OF HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S ALL DEED RESTRICTED FOR NUMEROUS DECADES WE'RE HERE TO URGE- THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER SOME OPTIONS. AND THE REASON WHY WE SAY THAT IS THAT THE OPTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT WE HAVE LOOKED AT EVERY- INSURER IT PROVIDES THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE. MOST OF THEM REQUIRE ONEROUS BURDEN SOME CREDIT QUALIFICATIONS WHICH WE DON'T GENERALLY IMPOSE. ARE FOUR OF THEM OF THE COMPANIES THAT OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA DON'T ALLOW YOU TO HAVE A BANKRUPTCY AND AFFECTION REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE RECENTLY HIGH CREDIT SCORES- HAVE TO CREDIT QUALIFY ON TWO POINT FIVE TIMES. FOR INCOME TO THE RANK STRUCTURE WE FIND THAT TO BE VERY VERY PROBLEMATIC. SOME OF THE OTHER INSURERS DON'T EVEN OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA SURE THE BOND COMPANIES THE SAME THING WE SOME OF THE COMPANIES SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED UNITS OR ALL OF THE ENTIRE BUILDING FOR THE US SO IN MANY WAYS WE FIND THAT THE INSURERS THAT OFFER THIS. HAVEN'T REALLY ENTERED THE CALIFORNIA MARKET REALISTICALLY AND WE WOULD WORDS. CONSEQUENTLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TYPE OF INSURANCE TENANT INSURANCE IN THIS CASE. THAT THIS PROGRAM TO BE MADE OPTIONAL NOT MANDATORY AND WE THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE. TO HAVE ENGAGED IN THAT TYPE OF DISCUSSION. DOES THIS- DOES IT OPTION BECAUSE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEEKS HAS SUGGESTED THEY LOOK AT. THE OTHER PART WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LANDLORD DOESN'T FIND INSURANCE PLANS TO BE ACCEPTABLE AS WE HAVE. OUTLINED HERE THAT THEY- THAT THEY DO ACCEPT TENANTS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED THEY DO ACCEPT TENETS THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN- IN DECLARE BANKRUPTCY THEY DO ALLOW TENNIS TO HAVE- NOT AS MUCH INCOME IS- SOME OTHERS. THE OTHER OPTION OF COURSE IS THE SIX MONTH PLAN IS THE AUTHOR HAS SUGGESTED. THAT IS PROVED TO BE VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR US- THROUGHOUT. OUR% CALIFORNIA HIM HERE'S ONE IS BECAUSE- IF THE TENANT STOPS PAYING THAT. AMOUNT THEN WE ARE FACED WITH A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT SECOND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHETHER. IT CAN HURT THE LOW INCOME TENANTS TO QUALIFY TO MOVE INTO AN APARTMENT WHY IS BECAUSE IF THE RENT IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AT THE SECURITY DEPOSIT- PAYMENT IS ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THEY WON'T QUALIFY BECAUSE THEY'RE STRETCHED TO THE MAX JUST TO MAKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. SO WE FIND THE SIX MONTH PLACEMENT PLAN NOT TO EFFECTIVELY WORK SO AS WE LOOK AT THESE OPTIONS WHETHER TO SURELY BOND COMPANY KNOCKING CALIFORNIA AS YET INSURERS PLACING A BURDEN SOME CREDIT QUALIFICATIONS OR THEIR SIX MONTH PAYMENT PLAN NOT TO EFFECTIVELY WORK WE WOULD URGE THAT THIS BILL- TO BE AMENDED TO DO JUST ONE THING MAKE AN OPTION SEE HOW IT WORKS. SEE THE INSURERS. AND EVERY ENSURE WE HAVE LOOKED AT- AT THE END WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE AS WE HAVE OFFERED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS- AS WE HAVE. I HAD SOME. PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT AND WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO. AMEND THE BILL. FOR BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FOR. AMEND THE BILL AND- WITH THAT WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO OPPOSE THE BILL WHAT'S THAT IS AMENDED THANK YOU THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE. ONE OPPOSITION ON THE LINE THE RECALLS AND- I YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME SIR YES. AT MONEY TO GIVE A CALL TO WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT AB THIRTY TO SIXTY IS ATTEMPTING TO RELIEVE TENANTS OF THE UP FRONT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RENTING BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE IN THE END FOR TENANTS AND PERHAPS FOR OWNERS AS WELL. SO FIRST LET ME START WITH THE SIX MONTH SECURITY TO PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS AB THIRTY TO SIXTY WILL COST OWNERS WE BELIEVE TO CHARGE HIGHER SECURITY DPOSITS IN THE OTHERWISE WOULD. IN ORDER TO COVER THE UP FRONT SITUATIONS WERE TENANTS LEAVE EARLY AT THE END- OR BEFORE THE SIX MONTH PERIOD AND THEY LEAVE ONLY RENT AND OR THEY DAMAGE THE UNIT. TODAY MOST OWNERS DO NOT CHARGE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW IN FACT THEY REQUIRE A LOWER DEPOSITED GENERALLY THE APPLICABLE TO MONTH LIMIT. AB THIRTY TO SIXTY UNFORTUNATELY WE BELIEVE WILL CHANGE THAT PRACTICE AND NOW FOR THE SECURITY DEPOSIT INSURANCE HERE ARE THE CHALLENGES FOR THE TENANT AND THE OWNERS. OF MOST OF THESE WORK LIKE A BALL AND IT ESSENTIALLY GUARANTEES THE TENNIS PERFORMANCE UNDER THE LEAST THE MONTHLY PREMIUM WHICH CAN RANGE FROM TWENTY DOLLARS TO FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH IS NON REFUNDABLE TO THE TENANT WERE OUT OF COURT THE TRADITIONAL SECURITY DEPOSIT IS REFUNDABLE. KENNETH FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT THE LEAST IN THE END DEPENDING UPON THE STATE A TENANT AND THAT MUCH. MORE THEN THE- EIGHT. FORWARD TO SECURE DEPOSIT. AT AND IT DOES NOT COME THE ENTIRE DAMAGING IN THE TEN. IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR REPAYING THE COPPER THE DAMAGE TO THE IN. COMPANY THE COMPANY CAN THAT FOR THE COMPANY PAID FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE TENNIS. AND EVEN SURE THE BOND DO NOT TYPICALLY COVER UNPAID READ LIKE A SECURITY DEPOSIT DOES. AFFECT INSURANCE OF BONDS ARE NOT HELPFUL FOR RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO PAY THE EXPENSES. FOR CLEAN THE POT THAT THE UNIT AT THE END OF THE TENDENCY. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT KIND OF DOES NOT FULFIL THEIR RENTAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE. NO WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. HOWEVER CAN MAKE CLEAR UNDER THE LAW BUT THESE INSURANCE BONDS ARE VOLUNTARY- BUT WE DO NOT WISH THIS TIME TO MAKE THE MANDATORY FOR MANY THE REASON STATED BY THE PREVIOUS WITNESS- AND FOR THESE REASONS TODAY. WE OPPOSE EIGHTY THREE TO SIXTY AND WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. SIR ON THE LINE WHO WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME. AND THAT YOU OPPOSE THE BILL THIRTY ONE IN THE QUEUE. LINE EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS PACKED MORE IN THERE AND WE CAN ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION.

LINE SEVENTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION. AT THE TIME THEY'RE NOT PREDICAMENT IN Q. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE PHONE LINES ON A. B. THIRTY TO SIXTY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU WHAT I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL OVER THE WEEKEND I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD ABOUT IT- IF A TENANT ELECTS TO PURCHASE AN INSURANCE POLICY IN LIEU OF A SECURITY DEPOSIT- OBVIOUSLY THAT INSURANCE POLICY IS GOING TO REQUIRE RENEWAL IF THE TENANT. STAYS IN THE UNIT BECAUSE THE EXPOSURE TO RISK OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT THE- THE TO THE TENETS OF THE UNIT SO. NOT IN THE EVENT THAT THE TENANT FAILS TO RENEW THE INSURANCE POLICY WHAT WHAT THEN HAPPENS BECAUSE THE BILL REALLY DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THAT YEP. AND I APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATION I BE ONE TO WORK WITH YOU ONCE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT IF. OTHER TEN DOES NOT PAY THE SECURITY DEPOSIT AND THEY WOULD BE THE- M. THEY BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE SECURITY DEPOSIT. FOR SOMETHING THAT IF OKAY THEY WERE. ON IF THEY DON'T THEN WHAT. LEADING BY OF THE LEASE TERMS DOWN. THEY BE AFFECTED. ACTUALLY IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY THE INSURANCE ARE NOT GONNA BE THE SECURITY DEPOSIT THE LAND THERE DOES NEED SOME KIND OF PROTECTION THERE BUT SIDE BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON SOME LANGUAGE THAT EFFECT OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT I HAVE THAT'S MY CONCERN ABOUT THE BILL IS THAT. THE REASON WHY SECURITY DEPOSITS EXIST YES TO PROTECT THE LANDLORD FROM POTENTIAL DAMAGE THAT THE TENANT DOES TO THE UNIT SINCE THE TENET DOESN'T ONLY UNIT. YEAH I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE PRESERVE THAT PROTECTION YEP- I FEAR THOUGH THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FORCED TO GO TO VERY PROBLEMATIC DIRECTION BECAUSE- THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY. FROM THE NEEDED TO EFFECT THE TEN AND IF THEY FAIL TO MATERIALLY ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THE LEASE. RIGHT NOW AND IF THE TERMS OF THE LEASE SAYS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVIDE A SECURITY DEPOSIT BUT YOU DO HAVE TO HAVE THIS INSURANCE POLICY IN PLACE. AND IF YOU FAIL TO DO THAT YOU COULD BE AFFECTED THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ENFORCE THAT AFFECTION. YEAH UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU LOOK AT- YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION THAT CALIFORNIA STATE POLICIES BEEN GOING OUT OF PATIENTS. WE'RE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WERE MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER. FOR TENNIS TO GET INFECTED. OUT OF CONCERN. THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE HOMELESS SO- I'M JUST AFRAID THAT THAT- THAT'S GOING TO BE JUST AN UNWORKABLE PROVISION OF THIS BILL. SO I I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT- WHAT SOME OF THE OPPONENTS HAVE THAT ADDRESS SURE. TO MAKE THE BILL BUT TO MAKE A BILL PERHAPS OPTIONAL. DID YOU PILOT PROGRAM TO SEE HOW. CNN TENNIS TAKE ADVANTAGE IT. SEE IF IT CAUSES. IF IT CAUSES EVICTIONS. AND THEN- YOU KNOW MAYBE WE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S THE DIRECTION I'D LIKE TO SEE THE WELCOME. WELL SO COUPLE THOUGHTS ON THAT THE BILL IS ABOUT OPTIONS RIGHT IT'S ABOUT OPTIONS THAT BOTH PROTECT THE LANDLORD- AND I AGAIN I DO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE SCENARIO IF. ATTENDED TO. PAY THEIR PREMIUM. THAN THEY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PAY THEIR SECURITY DEPOSIT IF THEY COULDN'T. BE VIOLATING THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AND- COULD FACE EVICTION POTENTIALLY- ABOUT MAKING THE ENTIRE BILL OPTIONAL- THAT'S EFFECTIVELY MY OPINION GETTING THE BILL- AND IT'S OPTIONAL RIGHT NOW. SO LANDLORDS RIGHT NOW COULD DO A SIX MONTH PAYMENT PLAN IF THEY WANTED TO. ON THE COULD YOU SOME OF THE STUFF SO THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT. GIVING OPTIONS FOR THE TENANTS WHO. ARE GOING TO NEED THEM DESPERATELY SPECIALLY WHEN HE FACES MASSIVE WAVE OF ACTIONS BUT- AGAIN I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE I THINK YOU RAISE SOME GOOD POINTS. AND WE TALK TO THE OPPOSITION QUITE A BIT. I'M ALSO HAPPY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE IF THAT'S ALL. FOLKS YOU KNOW WE CAN FIX FOR THE MISTAKES SURE OR CAN TO RESPOND YEAH YOU SURE HANDLE IN YOUR OR YOU PASS TURF AND EVERYTHING YOU WHAT THANK YOU VERY YOU KNOW I THE I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FACED WITH WHEN WE TRY TO CODIFY WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T RENEW YOUR POLICY IS THAT THE EVICTION PROCESS TAKES A WHILE SO YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE DO FOR A LANDLORD WHO HAS ATTENDED THE FILTER TO THE POLICY MAYBE THE POLICY HAS A PROVISION THAT THE LANDLORD GETS NOTIFIED TO LANGUAGE BECAUSE NOTIFIED. THE WEEK BEFORE THE POLICY IS DUE TO EXPIRE THAT THE TENANT HAS NOT RENEWED IT SO THE- TENET DOESN'T REALLY WHAT THE LANDLORD PROCEEDS WITH AND IF THEY DON'T GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO PROVIDE A SECURE DEPOSIT REPLACEMENT POLICY THE TENET FAILS TO DO THAT WE- FINALLY THE LANDLORD IS FORCED TO BRITISH EIGHT UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCEEDING AGAINST THE TENANTS YEAH YEAH THE TENETS EVICTED AND THE LANDLORD GOES AND FINDS A BUNCH OF DAMAGE TO THE UNIT WHICH IS NOT COVERED BECAUSE THE CURRENT POLICY. IS WHAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THE PROCESS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SURE I THINK IT'S COULD BE DIFFICULT TO TRY AND- TO TRY AND- HOW TO FLY AROUND THAT THAT. FOR BUT CERTAINLY WILL MINDED BUT THE OPPOSING TODAY OF LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON WHAT WE CAN COME UP WITH SURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY THE MISTER TO. IT'S KILEY. I THIS IS THE REASON THAT I'M SORRY MR KILEY YOU THE MASK IS OUT YOUR HEART OF THE DRAW I'M SPEAKING IT'S OKAY IF YOU WANT TO BE PROPERLY ATTIRED AND OTHER PROTOCOLS. WELL SO IS THERE A REASON THAT- SECURITY DEPOSIT LOANS ARE NOT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE IT SEEMS I CAN GET A PETTY GOOD AT PRETTY DECENT INTEREST RATES AND SOME YOU. BY SECURITY DEPOSIT ITSELF. I BE INTERESTED EXPLORE THAT. I MEAN I JUST GO ON AND I SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PROVIDERS OUT THERE SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE ARE THERE YEARS TO GETTING ONE OF THESE LOANS THAT MAKES- THIS POLICY SOLUTION. NECESSARY I'M I'M HAPPY TO EXPLORE AND. AGAINST ABOUT SPREADING OPTIONS FOR FOLKS. THANK YOU IT'S TRUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR FOR. STARTING TO THINK THROUGH A VERY VERY CHALLENGING SITUATION FOR US RIGHT NOW AND THAT IS THE FACT THAT. 40% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS CAMP BEFORE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ANY ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE MONTH. SO THE SCENARIO THAT WE HAVE IS WE KNOW THAT AND POTENTIALLY A FEW MONTHS WE MAY SEE A WAVE OF INFECTIONS. WE VERY LIKELY WILL HAVE. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OFNOT MILLIONS OF TENANTS TRYING TO LOOK FOR IN PLACE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAVINGS TO. QUALIFY FOR SECURE DEPOSITS ON A LOT OF WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL- BUT I THINK GIVEN THE HOUSING HOMES IS CRISIS ON TOP OF THE CORONAVIRUS PRICES. ON TOP OF THE KLAY FICTION OF. MONTHS WE HAVE TO THINK THINGS. I WAS LISTENING TO INTENTLY TO THE OPPOSITION I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW POINTS ABOUT THE OPPOSITION. OF SOME THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENTS AS A WAY OF JUST CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. I HEARD MR KINGSTON REFER TO THE FACT THAT. WE VERY LIKELY MAY SEE A TENANT WHO CAN'T AFFORD. THE SAY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND I THINK THAT VERY WELL COULD BE TRUE. I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL THAT TIENEN. GET THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO COBBLE TOGETHER SECURE DEPOSIT EVEN RENT IN THAT SPOT AND WE ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO HOW TO SOLVE THAT SHEET CAA'S CONTENTION THAT RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF LANDLORDS ARE NOT CHARGING TWO X. OR THREE X. KERN DEPOSIT. IF THAT'S THE CASE I MIGHT SUGGEST ANOTHER RAP FOR THIS IS WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT TWO X. OF THREE X. MARK. BUT IF I'M NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE THIS- I ALSO APPRECIATE THE IDEA THAT POTENTIALLY WE CAN DO THIS IN A VOLUNTARY OPTIONAL WAY. BUT WE KNOW THE REALITY IS. THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF LANDLORDS ARE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. AS EVIDENCED BY THE OPPOSITION TODAY AND SO. MAILLET ASK OF ALL PARTIES IS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS CONVERSATION- ARE WE HAPPY TO. ENGAGE WITH MISS WORKS ON THIS AS WELL- BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS- BECAUSE IT IS VERY LIKE. A COUPLE MONTHS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF TENANTS. WHO WILL KNOW. TO PREPARE. BE ABLE. TO SAVE. TO COST. WAS AND THEN ALMOST START AND SO WITH THAT. AGAIN APPRECIATE THE CREATIVITY. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD AND- CALL. WITH FOR. I THINK THAT WHAT WEEK'S IS PROPOSED. MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME AND WITHOUT A HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO WITH THIS BILL. I THINK IT WOULD A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND THE SECOND THING YOU VERY MUCH GALLAGHER. RIGHT THIS CALL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE THINK USER WEEKS FOR BRING THIS FOR AND TO THE SERVER SHOES POINT YOU KNOW THE MEDIAN RENTS SOUNDS DAYS OR THREE THOUSAND A MONTH AND SO IT. I THINK WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE RATHER THAN HAVING FOLKS EVEN IF IT'S A ONE X. SECURITY BUSCA SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT IS TWO X. OBVIOUSLY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE'RE ASKING A LOT. OF TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH HAT. AND PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE THIS CRISIS AND THIS IS A CRISIS WHERE. ALL OF US HAVE TO COME TOGETHER DISNEY'S SACRIFICES DOES BEEN DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY WE'VE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DOING. AND IN THIS CASE I THINK THE RISKS TO THE REAL NOT JUST REST WITH THE REALITY THAT. WE'RE GONNA SEE AN EXPLOSION AND HOMELESSNESS OR AT LEAST A HOUSING AND SECURITY EVEN BEYOND WHAT WE WERE. IN THE MIDDLE. OF A BOOMING ECONOMY. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES. TO TRY TO CREATE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. BUT I AGREE THE SUMMERS YOU THAT IT CAN'T JUST BE AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM. BECAUSE IT IS AN OPTIONAL PROGRAM AGAIN THEN. I'M SO THE PROOF YOUR ALLOW. TO DECIDE WHAT IT'S GOING TO OCCUR OR NOT. AND I WOULD ADD MORE THING IN TURN OF UP TO TEN LOOPHOLE THAT. IF A TENANT. CHOOSES RIVER OPS TO DO IT IS TO A SIX MONTH PAYMENT OR ALONE OR HAVE YOU. THAT THEY NOT BE BIASED AGAINST. A FOR MAKING THAT CHOICE SO COULD VERY WELL BE THAT ONCE IS AN AGREEMENT ON A LEASE AGREEMENT. THEN THE TENANT. IT WILL DECLARES WHAT MANNER THEY CHOOSE TO PAY THIS KERN ABBAS THERE'S GOT SOME PROTECTION ON THAT AND- OTHERWISE I THINK YOU'LL START TO SEE BIASES AGAINST- THOSE TENANTS AND IT'LL END UP AGAIN BEING A SITUATION WHERE THE TENANT WOULD DECIDE NOT TO DO IT. BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE COMPETING AGAINST. OTHER TENANTS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY SCRIPT HAS UP FRONT SO- FURTHER CONVERSATION ON HOW WE CAN HAVE. THE PROTECTION OF THOSE OPTIONS SO THE OPTION EXISTS HOW CAN WE MAKE IT PALATABLE TO ALL PARTIES TO THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND HOW DO YOU MAKE IT A REAL OPTION FOR TENANTS IN AGAIN THIS CRISIS SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO ALL COME TOGETHER IS CALIFORNIANS. AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A HOME SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MS WE I AGREE WITH THEM CHIU THAT THIS IS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT I THINK THAT THINGS ARE VERY DIFFERENT IN OAKLAND WHEN YOU COMPARE TO MY ARIENS SAMPOERNA DINO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MOVE INTO TO AN APARTMENT. AND SO I WANT TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION IN THAT REGARD- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS ALSO TO DISCUSS. THOSE WHO ARE RENTING MONTH TO MONTH. IF THEY'RE- GIVEN SIX MONTHS TO GIVE THE DEPOSIT. IT'S IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL WORK FOR THOSE LANDLORDS. I THINK TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT IS GOOD FOR OUR TENANTS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ALSO THAT MANY OF THESE LANDLORDS THEY'RE NOT THE HUNDRED APARTMENT UNITS MANY OF THEM ARE MOM POP WHO'VE INVESTED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVINGS INTO BUYING THESE RENTALS- AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE PROTECTIONS SO THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ONES THAT ARE SUBSIDIZING. I THINK FINDINGA WAY TO GET THE IMPACT ON THOSE SMALL- POP LANDLORDS IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BUT THE CONCEPT OF YOUR BILL I APPRECIATE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND TRYING TO FIND OPTIONS SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. COMMENTS FROM THE DIE. RIGHT SEE THAT IS WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS THANK YOU MR TO A ADDRESS A LOT OF THE THINGS I WAS GOING TO RAISE A IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE COMMENTS BY THE OPPOSITION- BUT I WILL SAY YOU KNOW MY THE GOAL HERE IS TO IS TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES TO TRY TO FIND MORE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE. ESPECIALLY IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT IS GOING TO CAUSE UNPRECEDENTED EVICTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE ACROSS THE STATE BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT- ADDING SENTIMENTS TO ADDRESS MR COLORS CONCERN WHICH TO SHARE AS WELL. WE WOULD MAKE SURE NOT AS- RATING A LAW THAT WILL CONTINUE ANY KIND OF FURTHER DISCRIMINATION. OR SCRATCH I PRACTICES. LOBBYIST EVEN THOUGH. MISTER WHAT IS GOING TO POSE A BILL THAT I WOULD BE. HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND KEEP WORKING FOR SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU RAISES WALLS. I'M IS REYES. AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF I THINK A CONVERSATION I SAW SOMETHING THERE'S OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THAT MR SHE RAISED AROUND. THE FACT THAT THE CAPS ARE. PRETTY HIGH. YOU KNOW I THINK WE CAN TALK THROUGH ALL THESE THINGS IN THE COMING- DAYS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS- AND I AM ALSO COMMITTED. THIS BILL OPPOSED TO BE DOUBLE REFER TO GO TO INSURANCE AS WELL. BECAUSE OF THE- PANDEMIC IT'S NOT AND SO I. GAVE MY ASSURANCES TO MR DAILY THAT I'D WORK WITH HIM AS WELL AND HIS COMMITTEE STAFF ON. ANY ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED AS WELL SO.

WE OFFER A FAIRLY AND FORTUNE THIRTY WHERE WOULD THAT HAVE BUT NOT THE TIRTY PARENTS ANYTHING HE'S WELL ATTENDED THE- FROM THE PROPER THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE- KIND OF HOPE LOOK FOR THAN THAT THEY'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO PAY OFF ALL THEIR DEATH CAN FORTY. SOME OF THE A LOT OF THE CHEESE IS. BASICALLY GIVE UP NOT MAKING ANY PAYMENTS AT ALL- IN THAT IT WILL WORK WITH A LOT THE NOT THAT THE OF PARENTS OF IN THE SITUATION. AND OFF THERE TOO. IN TERMS OF THE COPY OF THE CHECK. AND BECAUSE OUR- PAYING. UPS LESS TO THE CHILDREN TOOK MAKES ABOUT PARTICULAR WORKS. SPENDING ORDER CA YOUR HERE THEY CARTER TO HAVE. BENEFIT OF HELPING A TO AVOID THE AREA. WHICH ACTUALLY FOR A LOW THIRTY FIVE WITH THE THEY WOULD BE A POINT APPROACH TO HOW THE SITUATION FOR HIM THE ROUND STATE. BUT WHEN A LOT BETTER LOCAL TO FOR EIGHT CITIES. ALL THAT KIND OF GOING TO FROM DIFFERENT. FROM HAVE TO STANDARD LANGUAGES ALL OTHER TO ASSIST ARREARS SOME OTHER HAVE STAND LANGUAGE BUT IT PUT IT DOWN THE- OTHER COUNTY LANGUAGE. AN INSTALLER COUNTY DON'T HAVE EIGHT. FOR THEIR WHICH WILL BRING. GOING THROUGH THE- POSSIBLY IN HIGH AGREE TO BEING BORDER MODEST. PROCESS INVOLVED COURT. DELIVERED IS THAT IF YOU'RE- THE CARD THREE TODAY HI YOUR CAKE GOING TO BE. WILL DEPEND ON WHAT COUNTY MANAGING THE K. REINSTATE INSPECTIONS FOR BOTH THE POINT. WILL BE STORED AT YOU KNOW STATE APPROACH. WELL INSURE IT IN PPO BETTER THERE IS THE THEIR CHILD FOR THE MERRILEES FROM BECAUSE ATION. TO REMOVE THAT AREA THAT NEARLY REAL IN THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE ONE THE OTHER WAY ABLE TO PAY AREA TO THEIR READ. NEEDED CHILL. ANOTHER DAY OF BUT THEY'LL THE HAS BUILT A TAKE THAT WENT OUT THE OTHER THING WOULD BE TO NAY A- HEALTH A JOB BUT CHAO CLICK ABOUT. IT EITHER PART TO PARA EL CONCERN ABOUT THE COULD PETITION THAT WOULD BY THE. AND ANOTHER BENEFIT VERY YET LITTLE OUT FOR GREATER. THE BALL LOCAL COURT AND A LOT CHILD ONE EIGHTY THREE. FIRING REDUCING THE NEED TAKE EVERY MARKET REQUEST TO COURT. OVER THE THREE CST PORT BUT THEY'LL LET HER GET THE LIFE OF. THE COURT AND THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL COLLECTORS AND I'M NOT POVERTY AND- OTHER. AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOAL OF THAT TALK ABOUT TO SEND IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ORDERS THAT ARE CHARGED TO THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT REFLECT THE ACTUAL ABILITY TO EARN. YOU HAVE THAT MICHAEL PRESENTER AT THAT IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT THE ORDER. WE FLEXIBILITY GET EARNED- THAT WE NEED TO TAKE SOME KIND OF ACTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON- IT'S NOT AN AUTOMATIC EXTENSION THAT DOES NOT REMOVE THE PERFECT RIGHT TO APPEAL THEIR ORDER AND TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WITHIN THE COURT. TO GET AN ORDER THAT REFLCTS THEIR ABILITY TO EARN- THIS IS A LOT THIS IS THE RIGHT AND THEY HAVE UNDER THE LAW UNDER THE REGULATION- WHAT IT DOES IS NOT HAVING IT AND I TO FIND THAT THEY PUT. OWNERS ON THE LOCAL AGENCY TO A COURT AND THAT AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM TO INFORM THE PERSON WHO IS INCARCERATED OF THEIR RIGHT AND TO PROFIT. DOES APPEAL. WHETHER THAT THE ORDER IS AUTO. WE COULD SPEND IT DOESN'T PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE OR OR DOWN TO THE COURT. AT THE IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE CRYSTAL PARENT WHO. IS BLOWING JUST BY. OF BEING IN A FAMILY WITH A PER GOOD KNICKS. THOSE PEOPLE OFF HAVE THE RIGHT TO A APPEAL I REQUEST FOR OR- SO IF THE CASE WAS THAT SOMEBODY WHO WAS IN PRISON HAD ADDITIONAL WEALTH OR INCOME. AT THAT THOSE ORDERS WOULD BE REDUCED IF THAT WERE THE CASE. THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THIS IS THE PART THAT REALLY- I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MEANT. IS THAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AS I SAID BEFORE WHO ARE INCARCERATED THEY WERE POOR BEFORE THEY BECAME INCARCERATED AND THEIR CHILDREN AND ARE COMFORTABLE PARENTS ALSO CORPS- LOOK AT DON'T KNOW PARENTS WHEN THEY APPLY FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS THEY ARE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO OPEN A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER. THIS IS EVEN IF THEY DON'T WANT TO. AND OFTEN TIMES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AN OPTIONAL RELIEF FOR PEOPLE WITH DOMESTIC ABUSE. OR OTHER THINGS- AND OTHER SITUATIONS. THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO NOT. OPEN A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER. THE MONEY EACH MONTH THAT- THAT IS- DOING CAPITAL ORDER THAT'S NOT PAID EACH MONTH THAT IS NOT PAID WHEN THE FAMILY. OF A BENEFIT. IT NEVER GETS RETURNED TO THAT YOUR PARENTS. WANTED NOT PAID IT BECOMES DEBT- TO THE STATE FEDERAL. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND SO ONLY A TOPIC ORDER. IN THE MY THAT IT DO. ONLY THEN DOES THE MONEY GETS PASSED THROUGH FIFTY DOLLARS OF IT- AS PER STATE LAW. TO THE CUSTODIAL FAMILY. SO WE'RE NOT DOING BECAUSE THERE'S A FAMILY AND YOU ANY FAVORS HERE WHEN WE- WHEN WE REQUIRE. A JET TO BE BILLED TO THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT WHILE THEY'RE IN PRISON. THAT'S IMPORTANT THE LAST THING I WANT TO POINT OUT. IS THAT MANY CONSIDER MANY NON CUSTODIAL PARENT. THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE A NONCUSTODIAL PARENT WHETHER IN PRISON IS BECAUSE THEY'RE IN PRISON. THE MAJORITY OF 84% OF WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT. WE TURN TO THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON. AND OVER PRISON- INTO THE COMMUNITY WE TRY TO THEIR CHILDREN. THEY ARE NOT BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE SENT TO PRISON. AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPRISONMENT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE CAN'T BE DENIED IN. CALIFORNIA AND CONTRIBUTE TO THIS WAS TAKING OF WELCOMING COMMUNITIES IT DOESN'T HELP THE NOCTURNAL PARENT IT DOESN'T HELP THE CUSTODIAL PARENT. AND YOU HEARD BEFORE BUT I CO PRESENTED IT OFTEN HARM TO THE CHILD UPON RETURNED TO THE COMMUNITY. DOCTOR THESE REASONS WE ARE HERE I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

ON THE PHONE LIKE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND REGISTER OPPOSITION. RIGHT OPERATORS THIRTY ONE IN THE QUEUE. THIS TIME THERE ARE NO COMMENTS IN Q. RIGHT THANK YOU OFFER YOU CAN CLOSE THE PHONE LINES THAT FOR AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MUST KILEY. I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BILL I WANTED TO ASK THERE'S A AN EXEMPTION OR EXCEPTION OR THE BILL DOESN'T APPLY- FOR FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR FAMILY TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT ITSELF. I CAN I JUST ASK WHY IT WHY IS AN EXCEPTION THEIR WHITE WHY IT IS THE LOGIC OF IT ON A PLATE OF THOSE CASES. A CERTAIN WITH YOUR QUESTION YEAH WELL I AM THIRTY THE EXCEPTION FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE US CENSUS. WHY IS THERE NOT OR LINE WHY IS THAT. HY THEY'RE NOT AN EXCEPTION LIKE IS THERE AN EXCEPTION. WHY IS THERE AN EXCEPTION I DON'T HAVE THAT ANSWER FOR YOU NOW I'M WONDERING IF ANYBODY THE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE TWO. HI THIS IS VICTOR A WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND I THINK THE PURPOSE- BUT THE EXCEPTION IS TO- SAY IF. YOU ARE CARDS RATED BECAUSE YOU CAN IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. BARBIE AGAINST YOUR SPOUSE OR YOUR CHILD. OR YOU HAVEN'T PAID YOUR CHILD SUPPORT THAT WOULD NOT BE. OKAY YOU COULD DO AND THEN- RECEIVE THE BENEFIT- THAT THEY- CHILD SUPPORT ORDER SHALL I TAKE IT. INTENDED TO NOT REWARD- AN INDIVIDUAL FOR HIDING AGING IN THOSE BEHAVIORS. SO I GUESS THAT'S SORT OF MY POINT IS THAT WHY DOESN'T THAT- PREMISE APPLY FOR ALL CLASSES OF OFFENSES. THIRTY ONE ANSWER THAT. HI MICHAEL YEAH BUT COULD YOU JUST REPEAT THE QUESTION AND THE THIRTY ONE AFTER THAT. THE OTHER QUESTION WAS- YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT THAT WAS JUST STATED AS WE DON'T WANT TO REWARD FOLKS FOR HAVING COMMITTED PARTICULAR OFFENSES AS THE WIND IS NOT LOGIC NOT APPLY TO- ALL OFFENSES FOR WHICH YOU MIGHT BE INCARCERATED. YEAH GOOD DID YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT. AS I UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT BE MORE- ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT BUT AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THE DARK- THE SPECIFIC ALLOW ME TO PROVIDED FOR UNDER FEDERAL. GUIDE AND YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL CONTACT THE CHILD SUPPORT IS THAT CHILD SUPPORT IS THAT THE ORDERS ARE SUPPOSED TO REFLECT THE EARNING AT A ABILITY OF THE PERSON AND I THINK THAT BURNING ABILITY RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE PERSON IS OUT OF PRINT AND IF THE PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY AND- I WILL HAVE NEVER GOT PREVENT ANY SIMPLY CHOOSIN NOT TO WORK EARN MONEY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT- THAT PERSON HAS EIGHT EIGHT IF THEY'RE ABLE BODIED ANY DEEMED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK. THEN AND THEIR ORDER CAN BE SET APPROPRIATELY- BUT A PERSON IN PRISON DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO WORK OR IF THEY DO WORK THEY ARE THEY ARE EARNING 8% TO A 30% TAKEN ALMOST 50% AGAIN OUT QUIRK OVER ACCUSED- SO THE ORDER. IT'S PHOTO. THE EARNING ABILITY OF THAT PERSON. IT LOOKS TO CARVE OUT ARE ALLOWED AND ENCOURAGED EITHER. THE FEDERAL LAW THERE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD THE. TWO NO I THINK THE I YOU. IT AND COULD AND I THINK THAT THE INTO IS TO. AT THE- HOLD BILL'S PROVISIONS IS TO PUT. I'M NOT PROVIDE ANY TYPE BUT THE CHANGE OF NOR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OR BENEFIT FOR INDIVIDUAL GAUGING IN THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU. I OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS THE DIVES WITHOUT THIS KIND I THINK YOU RAISE IT AN INTERESTING QUESTION AND IT HAS TO DO I THINK MORE. OKAY WELL ME LET ME JUST FINISH THIS THOUGHT THAT MORE WITH THE POLITICS OF HOW WE PUNISH OR NOT OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE RELIEF FOR SOMEONE WHO IS INCARCERATED THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PUBLIC BACKLASH FOR ALL MY GOSH THIS IS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. PERPETRATOR WAR THIS SOMEONE WHO HASN'T PAID CHILD SUPPORT BEFORE SO WHY WOULD WE GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE BILL IT'S REALLY AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE AS OPPOSED TO ANY ECONOMIC OR RATIONAL RESPONSE BECAUSE YOU CORRECT. RATIONALLY ANYONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY. WE SHOULD BE ESSENTIALLY HOLDING THE OBLIGATIONTO PAY CHILD SUPPORT BECAUSE W'RE JUST EXACERBATING THE SITUATION SO THAT SAME LOGIC WOULD IMPLY. BUT OFTEN TIMES THAT I THINK THERE THIS DOES HAVE MORE TO DO WITH WITH SOME OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND FEDERAL LAW. BUT A LOT OF THAT COMES FROM. THIS IS THIS IS A- HEINOUS ENOUGH RYAN OR THIS IS AN ON POINT CRIME SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF IT. AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE SAFETY LAW CRIMINAL LAW AND WHEN WE LOOK AT PUNISHMENTS AND RELEASES REPLETE WITH THESE KINDS OF. NOT NECESSARILY RATIONAL POLICY DECISIONS BUT EMOTIONAL POLICY DECISIONS BASED AROUND THE- THE TYPE OF OFFENSE AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. THAT YOU THAT WE SEE THOSE KINDS OF DISTINCTIONS BEING MADE OTHERWISE YEAH THERE'S NOT. NECESSARILY RATIONAL RESPONSE. THIS IS A- THANK YOU KNOW AND I'M SO SORRY WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO EVEN SPEAK ABOUT THIS BILL IN NAME BEEN MEANING ALL WEEKEND TO CALL YOU AND I DID AND SO I APOLOGIZE IF THIS NEEDS MY VOTE TODAY TO MOVE IT ON I WILL VOTE FOR IT I'M POLICY REASONS BUT I REALLY HOPE TO STOP IN A MINUTE. ECHO THE SAME THING I SAID NOW FOR I THINK WE'VE SEEN THIS BILL THREE TIMES. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS NOT THAT. THE OVER REACHING POLICY THAT OF COURSE OF SOMEBODY CAN'T PAY IT MORE PUTTING SOMEBODY FURTHER IN DEBT IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE- I DO LIKE THE EXCEPTIONS AND I'M NEXT I THINK QUITE FRANKLY THAT THERE ARE RANT BUT RARE SITUATIONS. WHERE COUPLES CAN DEVOLVE SO BADLY IN A RELATIONSHIP THAT SAYS THAT- OFTEN I'M HAND. WILL RIGHT WOULD RATHER GO TO JAIL THEN PAY CHILD SUPPORT AND IS ABOUT ABUSE AND IT IS ABOUT- CONTROL OVER A SITUATION THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY HAVE HAPPENED. BUT THAT BEING SAID MY CONCERN IS THIS POLICY DOESN'T FOCUS ON THE CHILD WE BENEFIT- THE SITUATION MAYBE THE INCARCERATED- BY RELIEVING OF THIS UNREALISTIC PRESSURE TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT WHERE IN PRESENT. BUT IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE CHILD AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IN THIS BILL AND I'VE ASKED FOR NOW IF MULTIPLE TIMES. IS SOME SORT OF- PARENTING CLASS OR INVOLVEMENT CLASS THAT THE- THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE TO TAKE WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED SO ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING ANYTHING FINANCIALLY TO THEIR CHILD DURING THAT TIME. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO OR REQUIRE IN ORDER THAT THEIR- THAT CHILD IS GOING TO ALTERNATELY HAVE A BENEFIT. OF THAT REALLY FOR PAYMENT AND SO- THAT'S SOMETHING I ASKED FOR I HAVEN'T EVER SEEN AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME. SOME OF THESE TYPES OF- OF CLASSES THROUGHOUT OUR OUR SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT- THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL MUCH BETTER ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF LEAVING EVEN FOR MONTHS OR YEARS- CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS THAT ARE COMING ANYWAY YOU KNOW WHERE WE WERE ALL VERY REALISTIC. BUT IF WE'RE TRULY CHILD'S CENTRIC AND HOWARD VIEWING CHILD SUPPORT AND THE NECESSARY- NEEDS OF A CHILD. THEN SOMETHING THAT FIRST RATE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE DOING. IN ORDER TO. VIRGINIA WITH WITH MORE DEBT AND I JUST MY FIRST. ON A BILL LIKE THIS I SAID I DON'T PLAN TO VOTE FOR TODAY I WILL NECESSARY GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THIS RACE. I THINK THE BENEFIT THERE IS I THINK THE BENEFIT TO THE CHILD I THINK THAT TO WIN. THE CHARACTERS INCARCERATED FOR SUCH A LONG TIME AND IS THEN. RELEASED THE CHANCES OF RETURNING TO THEIR CHILD AND BEING INVOLVED IN A CHILD'S LIFE IS GREATER AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE DEBT ON TOP OF THEM. I DO APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT SAM TO DINO FATHERHOOD TOOK A STAND ON THIS IS WORLD ARE VERY IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION IN MY COMMUNITY AND HAS BEEN WORKING WITH FATHERS FOR YEARS TO GET THEM INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILD'S LIVES- AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERY POSSIBILITY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RECIDIVISM. WE WANT TO DECREASE RECIDIVISM WE WANT TO DO WHATEVER IT IS IT'S POSSIBLE TO. RE INTEGRATE SOMEONE IS INTO SOCIETY AS BEST AS POSSIBLE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO RE INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE LIFE OF THE CHILD. AND IF HAVING THIS. TAKEN CARE OF BECAUSE THEY CANNOT PAY THIS IT THE OF A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER THERE'S NO WAY FOR THEM TO PAY IT. AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS INCREASING THE DEBT UNNECESSARILY. I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENT FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADDED I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL IDEA SO THAT- THAT IT IS. A FORM OF PAYING A DEBT TO THEIR CHILD BY. MAKING THEMSELVES BETTER PARENTS BUT THE BILL AS IT STANDS ALSO WE'RE WE'RE STANDING SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING THAT SUNSET SOON AND I APPRECIATE TO- IS CARILLO YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD THANK YOU. YOU HAVE N. BITS GONZALEZ I JUST WANT TO KNOW TO YOU HAVE BROUGHT THAT UP CONSISTENTLYIN AND I THINK YOU ARE CORRECT. AND IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT A PROGRAM LIKE THAT. IN THE PRISONS EFFECTIVELY I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. SO THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE SOMETHING AT STAKE WHEN GETTING THE BENEFIT AND I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO RELIEVING THE ISSUE THE MISTER KILEY BROUGHT UP. THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT THEN JUST RELIEVING TO RELIEVE BUT TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FINDING A WAY TO PUT THAT FAMILY BACK TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT HE CAN. GET BACK TOGETHER. BUT WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE LIKE THE BATTER INTERVENTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER STATE JUST. AREN'T REALLY WORKING. IN THE STATE AND IF WE COULD. HE'LL TAKE A BETTER LOOK AT THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND FOCUS ON ESPECIALLY MEN THERE'S A GREAT PROGRAM. AS WASREYES TALKS ABOUT IN WATSONVILLE AREA POP THAT THAT ADDRESSES YOUNG MAN ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO'VE COME OUT OF JAIL AND WHEN THEY WAKE UP TO WHAT IT IS WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE TO BE PARENTS AT ITS PEER IN FORCE IN ITS PURE EDUCATED. THE BENEFITS TO THOSE FAMILIES ARE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE SO YES THIS IS TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF BUT WITHOUT THAT NEXT STEP OF INSURING. EIGHT EIGHT DISTRICTS IN THE FAMILY. SO COMING TO YOU NEXT ANYWAY IT'S GONZALEZ SO HE COULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT. ALL RIGHT THIS COULD REALLY MAKE CLOTHES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WANT TO ADDRESS AT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. UP MISTER KILEY TOTALLY APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS AND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM- MANY OF U HAVE THE SAME SAME QUESTIONS- BUT IT TO THE CHAIRS POINT I THINK SOMETIMES WE HAVE EMOTIONAL REACTIONS TO. HOW IT IS THAT WE SEE JUSTICE AND HOW IT IS THAT WE SEE THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED ARE BILL DOESN'T ESTABLISH THE EXCEPTIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED THOSE ARE PRE EXISTING. WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO IS EXTEND THE SUNSET EXTEND THE TIME LIKE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MAKING EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR AND YOUR MANDATED TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS ALREADY TAKES 55% OF YOUR EIGHT CENTS. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PAY YOUR CHILD SUPPORT- AND YOU'RE GOING TO GOING TO ADDITIONAL DEBT- THE COMMENTS MADE BY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES AYE I APPRECIATE BECAUSE- IN MY DISTRICT. WE HAVE HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS MEN AND WOMEN WHO WISH AND WANT TO DO THAT THAT VERY BEST THEY CAN TO RE INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY TO BE GOOD PARENTS. AND TO RETURN TO THEIR FAMILIES I WANT TO. INVOKE ACTUALLY THE MEMORY OF BOBBY VERDUGO WAS A CHICANO RIGHTS- CIVIL JUSTICE LEADER WHO RECENTLY PASSED INTO THE LATINO CAUCUS I WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE LAST YEAR WHO IS PART OF THE NATIONAL COMBAT AT WORK IN A LEADER IN MY COMMUNITY. POSSIBLE AND MISSION IS TO HELP FAMILY INCARCERATED YOUNG MEN TO THE FAMILIES TO BE GOOD PARENTS AND ACTUALLY IN MY COMMUNITY- ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS MUST CONSOLIDATE TO WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO- THAT IT EFFECTIVELY TAUGHT A YOUNG MAN- HOW TO BE A GOOD FATHER. ARE IN IF THEY WEREN'T FATHERS HOW TO BE GOOD MEN AND THEIR COMMUNITY AND HOW TO BE GOOD AS BEEN GOOD FATHERS IN FUTURE THE CHILL TO. I THINK THOSE ARE INCREDIBLY PROGRAMS THAT ARE ESPECIALLY IF YOU COME FROM COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFERING CREDIBLE. VIOLENCE OR INCREDIBLE POVERTY AND SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LOVE TO ON IN THE FUTURE THE I THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR THIS. IMPRINT ADDING SOMETHING LIKE THAT- I THINK IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY LIVING ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE IT EVEN A LITTLE BIT HARDER. BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALLOCATE FUNDS. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. OR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OR WHATEVER ENTITY IT MAY BE. A TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMS IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT MAY ACTUALLY NOT WORK ONCE PEOPLE ARE RELEASED. SO THAT PROGRAM I THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. IF ESTABLISHED ONCE WITHIN YOU HAVE YOUR CHILD SUPPORT STUFF VISITATION RIGHTS. TO THE YOUR CALL CURRENTLY DOING SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS FOR YOU TO LEARN OR- HOW TO BE A BETTER. UP FAMILY INDIVIDUAL WHETHER YOU'RE A MAN OR A WOMAN- AS YOU ESTABLISH BACK YOUR REINTEGRATION BACK TO SOCIETY. SO I SAY THAT ALL TO SAY THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE END OF THE DAY LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES AND THE COURTS ARE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL RULES AND ARE NOT INUNDATED WITH UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK OVER EIGHT CENTS A 55% OF WHICH GOES BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. IT HELPS ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GOALS THE REDUCING RECIDIVISM RECIDIVISM RATES AND ULTIMATELY ENSURES THAT PARENTS ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR CHILDREN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I. THANK YOU THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HI STONE HI GALLAGHER. CHECK OUT. OUR LIVE TO. TO BUY GUNS ALL. HOLDEN CALL. FILE. KILEY NOT NOTING MAIENSCHEIN. OBERNOLTE OUR OVER NO I REYES ON REYES. IT HAS FIVE OF. AB TWENTY THREE NINETY PATTERSON SO OUR NUMBER SIX IS. THIS DALY WHO IS NOT HERE SO LET'S GO TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY ONE AS MR GABRIEL IS HERE. SO I IF YOU GET A LINE FOR A. TWO TWO SEVENTY ONE. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YEAH MEMBERS HI PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB TO SEVENTY ONE WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN THE SERGEANT SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL ACT THE SHRIVER PROGRAM PROVIDES LEGAL REPRESENTATION TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN HIGH STAKES CIVIL MATTERS IMPACTING BASIC HUMAN NEEDS SUCH AS CHILD CUSTODY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND EVICTION PROCEEDINGS AS YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB THREE THIRTY BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE FRIDAY PROGRAM SO THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN BE ASSURED OF MEETING FOR ACCESS TO JUSTICE THROUGH OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY ONE BUILT UPON NOT PROGRESS AND STRENGTHENS THE SHRIVER PROGRAM IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST THISLEGISLATION WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE SHRIVER PROGRAM. ACTUALLY MANY LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION TO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS ATTACHED TO FEDERAL FUNDING. THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP TO ADDRESS THAT YOU JUSTICE BY REQUIRING THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO REFER IMMIGRANTS FOR SERVICES ELSEWHERE IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE THEM. THIS REQUIREMENT IS BOTH MORAL AND DEEPLY PRACTICAL ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN ARE UNDOCUMENTED NEIGHBORS WHO ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED A CENTRAL RELEASED AND ARE THEREFORE MORE LIKELY TO NEED THE TYPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE FIBER PROGRAM. SECOND THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE COURTS TO COLLECTED MAKE AVAILABLE CERTAIN BASIC DATA ABOUT EVICTION PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS FILE PRESENT CODE. THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION WILL ALLOW FOR IMPROVED RESEARCH AND DATA DRIVEN POLICY MAKING. INCLUDING BETTER TARGETING OF LEGAL SERVICES AND OTHER RESOURCES. SUCH DATA IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT. GIVEN THE OVERWHELMING I'M HAVE EVIDENCE THAT HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION. IN PARTICULAR STOPPING MORE CALIFORNIANS FROM SLIPPING INTO HOMELESSNESS IS KEY TO SOLVING OUR STATES CRISIS. TO BORROW AN APT ANALOGY FROM ONE OF THE SUPPORT LETTERS TRYING TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IN DISPLACEMENT WITHOUT THE DATA THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED UNDER AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY ONE. A SIMILAR TO ASKING AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO FIGHT A VIRAL DISEASE WITHOUT ADEQUATE TESTING AND MAPPING. IN SOME AT A TIME OF TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AB TWENTY TO SEVENTY ONE WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. HOW PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS AND ALL GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS TO CRAP DATA DRIVEN RESPONSES TO OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS APPROACH ARE BRENDA SHOCKLEY DEPUTY MAYOR OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. CARMEN MCDONALD. OF LEGAL SERVICES FOR THE LA CENTER ON LOOK FOR LAW AND JUSTICE.

AND WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO WE WERE HELPING BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING. AND THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE DIDN'T HAVE FUNDING TO HELP OUR WORK IMMIGRANT. THOSE WHO WHO WERE UNDOCUMENTED AND SO I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS EXTREMELY POOR TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS DIRECTED AND THEY CAN RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE NEEDS I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THIS GATHERED. YES SO. THE TO THE AUTHOR HAS YOU KNOW UP IN SUPPORT OF THOSE. OF THE PROGRAM AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO TRY AND EXPAND IT- IN THE PAST- SO I'M I'M DEFINITELY SUPPORT OF. THE REFORM HERE THIS TRYING TO GET AT THAT ISSUE. THE COLLECTION OF DATA JUST I WONDER IF THAT IS. WHAT IT REALLY TELLS US I MEAN I WAS HE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS HAPPENING FOR THE PRETTY EXECUTIVE ORDER- SO. YEAH AS OF RIGHT NOW THERE WOULD BE ANY OF ACTIONS- YOU KNOW I I'M ASSUMING AFTER THAT IT ORDER EXPIRESWE PROBABLY WILL SEE. SOME OF THE ACTIONS BUT WHETHER OR NOT A AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER HAS BEEN FILED USUALLY THAT'S A LAST RESORT. YOU KNOW SOMEONE. I I'VE I BELIEVE IN THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF CASES THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE A LANDLORD DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO PROCEED WITH AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER- IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO AND IF THEY CAN WORK THROUGH IT. AND IT ALSO DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN AND HE MIGHT NOT HAVE UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS BUT YOU COULD STILL HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS RIGHT- YOU COULD STILL HAVE. THE OTHER MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT WEIGH INTO THAT SO. I DO KIND OF QUESTION WHETHER NOT WE NEED TO HAVE THIS. COLLECTION COMPONENT AND WHAT IT REALLY TELLS US YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF. BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK IN MY AREA I COULD HAVE MAYBE NOT VERY MANY UNLAWFUL RETAINERS BUT I STILL NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING THIS TO THE PEOPLE- ARE AVAILABLE TO THOSE UNITS ARE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO. RIGHT SO I GET MAYBE SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT YEAH IF YOU CAN. YEAH MISTER. YEAH I THINK IT'S A FIX THANK YOU FOR THE FOR THE COMMENTS IN THE FEEDBACK AND AGAIN VERY APPRECIATIVE ACOSTA PART OF AB THREE THIRTY AND OF THE EFFORTS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. I GUESS ON THE- DATA COLLECTION PIECE YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOING TO TELL US THE WITH THE FULL STORY IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE STORY- BUT WHAT I WILL SUGGEST YOU IS IT'S A PIECE OF THE STORY THAT THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT I. KNOW FOR YOU IN YOUR PACKET IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS OUR TENANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION AS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS OUR LEGAL SERVICES NONPROFIT SO. I THINK THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFTEN AREN'T ON THE SAME PAGE THAT HAVING THIS DATA IS HELPFUL IN CRAFTING THOUGHTFUL PUBLIC POLICY RESPONSES AND SO WE'VE WORKED WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS AS YOU HEARD FROM. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THEY THINK THIS DATA IS A CENTRAL TO HELP CRAFT- TAKE TO HELP OUR POLICY AND DEPLOY VERY SCARCE RESOURCE MISS FIREMEN CERTAINLY THAT ORGANIZATIONS THE LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PROVIDING THE- REPRESENTATION THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO. IT'S TO TELL US TO BE DO THIS I DON'T BUT THERE A DAY OUT THERE THAT COULD NOT. HI BUT I IS MADE UP WE HOW. IN INFORMING ALL ECONOMIC BELIEVER THAT DATA JR POLICY MAKING IS NOT ABOUT TO GO ABOUT THIS I IN THE DISCHARGED.

IT FOR THOSE WITNESSES WHO ARE CALLING IT IF YOU WERE NOT ACTUALLY SPEAKING WE WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU WOULD BE YOUR PHONES THANK YOU THIS DALY WELCOME. WELL HI. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THINKING THE COMMITTEES CONSULTANT FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK. AB. TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE AS A SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD FIX TO EXISTING LAW ON PARENTAGE CASES. BASED ON NINETEEN SEVENTIES LAW THERE IS NO LONGER SOCIALLY RELEVANT ALL PAPERS RECORDS AND HEARINGS PERTAIN TO PARENTAGE ACTIONS. INVOLVING I'M MARRIED OR SINGLE PARENTS ARE CONFIDENTIAL EXCEPT FOR THE FINAL JUDGMENT. THIS REQUIRES A LEVEL OF SECRECY AND CHILD CUSTODY AND CHILD SUPPORT CASES INVOLVING I'M MARRIED OR SINGLE PARENTS THAT IS NOT REQUIRED IN KC IN CASES. INVOLVING MARRIED OR FORMALLY MARRIED PARENTS. IT CREATES AN ANALYSIS IT CREATES UNNECESSARY RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO CASE FILES INHERITED CASES THE OUGHT TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN DIVORCE AND CUSTODY CASES. FOR EXAMPLE IN CHECK CHILD SUPPORT AND CUSTODY CASES CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A COURT TO CONSIDER PAST ACTIONS A DIVESTITURE BY LET'S BY PARENTS IN DECIDING CASSIDY. INCLUDING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AGAINST A CHILD OR CO PARENT WHO IS NOT PARTY TO THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS. BUT DUE TO THE CURRENT COMPANY GEOLOGY OF PARENTAGE CASES ANY EVIDENCE OR ALLEGATIONS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONTAINED IMPERATIVE ACTIONS ARE NOT ACCESSIBLE TO A PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT PARENTAL PARTNER. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PARTY TO THE PARENTAGE ACTIONS AND THOSE CASE FILES ARE SEALED. THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM THESE FILES IS AN EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS UPON AN ORDER FROM THE COURT WHICH IS A LONG EXPENSIVE AND DRAWN OUT PROCESS. THIS UNDERMINES THE GOAL THE CURRENT CHILD SUPPORT IT COSTS A LOT AND AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE PROPOSES THE SIMPLE THINGS. THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT PARENTS JUST CASES INVOLVING I'M MARRIED OR SINGLE PARENTS BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. EXCEPT IN CASES INVOLVING ASSISTED REPRODUCTION. THIS EXEMPTION WAS NEGOTIATED WITH MY STAFF AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. TO ACCOMMODATE CONCERNS FROM THE OPPOSITION IN CONCERT WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE. WITH ME TODAY ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS JUST MCCONNELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION BILL SPONSORED. THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE ONE WITH THIS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. JUSTIN O'CONNELL PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME CURRENT YES WE CAN'T. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE MY NAME IS JUSTIN O'CONNELL I'M AN ATTORNEY IN PRIVATE PRACTICE IN MONTEREY CALIFORNIA CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST BUT STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE LEGISLATION CHAIR FOR THE FAMILY LAW SECTION THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. WHICH SPONSORS THE BILL. AB. SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE WILL ELIMINATE CONFIDENTIALITY. ASSOCIATE WITH PACKAGE ACTIONS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION ACTION ACTIONS WHICH SHALL REMAIN UNCHANGED. IN DOING SO IT WILL. MAKE PARENTAGE FILED ACCEPTABLE TO PARENTS THE COUNCIL AND IMPORT AND- WILL PROMOTE REPORT PUBLIC POLICY CONSIDERATIONS AT THE CURRENT LAW STANDS THE RECORD HEARINGS ARE CONFIDENTIAL UNDER FAMILY COULD SECTION TWENTY SEVENTY SIX FORTY THREE WHICH SHOULD NOT APPLY TO MARITAL DISSOLUTION LEGAL SEPARATION ACTIONS. THIS IS A COMPONENT OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE PAIR UNIFORMED PARA TO JACK AS ADOPTED BY CALIFORNIA NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. AND AT THAT TIME THERE WERE FEWER BIRTH OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE AND THEY'RE JUST IT BROUGHT TO KEEP EGGMAN NATION OF ON WHAT MOTHERS AND THEIR CHILDREN. HERITAGE ACTION FOR MAY CONFIDENTIAL FOR THAT REASON. NOW FORTY FIVE YEARS LATER STUDY NO LONGER HOLD THOSE VIEWS OF ON WHAT MOTHERS AND CHILDREN THE ANTIQUATED JUSTIFICATION FOR CONFIDENTIALITY NO LONGER EXISTS. AS NOTED BEFORE THEIR HURDLES AND OBSTACLES TO OBTAINING INFORMATION IN CALCUTTA DETERMINATION AS WELL AS CHILD SUPPORT TERMINATION BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY. THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THE LAW TO TREAT PARENTS JACKSON'S DIFFERENTLY THAN MARITAL DISSOLUTION AND LEGAL SEPARATION ACTIONS. AB TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE WILL PROVIDE EQUAL ACCESS ALREADY AFFORDED TO THIS OTHER ACTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW IS THE TIME WAS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEAR THE COMMITTEE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE. RIGHT SIGNAL AND IS THERE ANYONE ON THE TELEPHONE. WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE YOU CAN GIVE US YOUR- NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE ONE ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. THE FAMILY HAD NO COMMENT CAN QUEUE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WE DO HAVE ONE REGISTERED OPPOSITION THE REAL WORLD. YEAH GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DOUBLE WALL THE MORNING- THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BRIEFLY- MY NAME IS DOUBLE WALL THEN I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH OVER THIRTY YEARS IN PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO A CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW. SPECIALIST THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY THE ACADEMY OF CALIFORNIA ADOPTION AND THE FIFTH SHOULD BE PRODUCTION ATTORNEYS. FEEL SO STRONGLY THAT AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE NEEDS TO BE AMENDED TO KEEP IT THE DEGREE PRODUCTION JUDGMENTS CONFIDENTIAL. I FITTED REPRODUCTION CASES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PARENTAGE CASES FOR AT LEAST THREE READ THAT. PART BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER PARENTAGE CASES THEY ALMOST ALWAYS ARE UNCONTESTED. SECOND BECAUSE IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT THE TERMS OF THE JOHN ARE ENSURING THAT THE AGREEMENT INTO WHICH THE PARTIES HAVE ENTERED THE PARTIES HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO TO COURT TO CONFIRM THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES AT PARENTS. DON'T ARE THERE I GET IT CETERA. AND THIRD BECAUSE THE PACKAGE JUDGE MAHON AND ASSISTED REPRODUCTION MATTERS TYPICALLY AND THE LITIGATION BECAUSE THERE IS NO DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND NOTHING FURTHER SUCH A COMPANY LIKE CHILD SUPPORT REQUIRING. THE COURT'S ATTENTION. THE OWNER SO I GET ALL YOU KNOW. DONATED JEFF DATED ON CONDITION THAT THEIR STATUS AS NON PARENTS WOULD BE PROTECTED AND ALSO ON CONDITION THAT THEIR DONATION BUDGET STATION WOULD BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. THESE PROMISES GENERALLY WERE INTEGRAL TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND EMBODIED IN A WRITTEN CONTRACT. THE CONFIDENTIALITY WE ARE SPEAKING AS A POTENTIAL CAN MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONTRACT. THERE'S NO WAY TO CRAFTED THIS KID REPRODUCTION JUDGMENT TO PROVIDE EVERYONE WITH A WITH THE LEGAL PROTECTION THEY ARE SPEAKING. WITHOUT ACCURATELY IDENTIFYING THEM IN THE JUDGMENT. THEREFORE IF THE JUDGMENT IS NOT CONFIDENTIAL THE PARTIES IDENTITIES NO LONGER WILL BE CONFIDENTIAL EITHER THAT FAILING TO KEEP THE JUDGMENT CONFIDENTIAL UNDERMINE ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THE CAKE THAT IS TO ALLOW THE DONORS AND SIR I GET TO GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES WITHOUT UNNECESSARY DISRUPTION. WITHOUT THAT CONFIDENTIALITY THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD THAT DONORS WILL NOT DONATE LEAVING FOR EXAMPLE MORE EMBRYOS CRYO PRESERVED. AND MORE INFERTILE PEOPLE WITHOUT OPTIONS FOR HAVING CHILDREN. AND PARENTS WILL BE STRIPPED OF THE RIGHT TO TELL THEIR CHILDREN THAT STORY BUT DON'T WORRY JAN IN THE TIMELY MANNER DAY DEEMED DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY HIGH PROFILE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT PLAYING OUT IN THE MEDIA. ANDERSON COOPER RECENTLY BECAME A FATHER. AND ANNOUNCED HIS PATERNITY ON NATIONAL TELEVISION AND HE'S PUBLICLY THANK TO THIRD GET WITHOUT AGAIN TO FIND HER. STOP ANYTHING FOR MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPENED HAD ANDERSON COOPER COURT JUDGMENT MAKING HIM A LEGAL FATHER INTO THIRD GET NOT A LEGAL MOTHER. BEEN MADE PUBLIC ANY IF YOU DOUBT THAT THE MEDIA WOULD BE CAMPED OUT ON HIS SURROGATE SPOT MON RIGHT NOW HOPING TO GET PICTURES OF HER AND HER HUSBAND AND THEIR CHILDREN. THE ACADEMY RESPECT COMMITTEE POSITION THAT IS THE GENERAL RULE FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS SHOULD BE PUBLIC. BUT WHAT ALL PARTIES ENTER INTO A WRITTEN AGREEMENT BY WHICH THEY ALL AGREE THAT SOME OF THEM WILL BE PARENT THAN OTHERS WELL NOT AND THEIR- PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE RESPECTED. HOW IS THE PUBLIC INTEREST START BY UNDERMINING DOES AGREEMENT. WHAT MONTH BY IS ALRIGHT ADDED FAMILY CODE SECTION SEVENTY SIX FORTY THREE POINT FIVE. APPLICABLES ONLY TO ASSISTED REPRODUCTION CASES THAT MAINTAINS THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THESE SPECIFIC CASES WHILE THE OTHER TYPE THE POUNDAGE CASES ARE MADE PUBLIC THE ONLY CHANGE WE ARE REQUESTING. THAT THE JUDGMENT IN THESE SPECIFIC CASES ALSO BE DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL COMPARABLE TO ADOPTION JUDGMENT WITH LONG HAVE BEEN CONFIDENTIAL. SO IT'S NOT THAT UNDERMINE THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF SECTION SEVENTY SIX FORTY THREE POINT FIVE. THIS IS A SIMPLE FACT AND WE HOPE WILL HAVE YOUR SUPPORT IN MAKING IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE TO REGISTER. UP ON A TWENTY SEVEN FORTY FIVE ANYONE ON THE PHONE. IT WAS FIRST WAS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE.

MORE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTEEN AIMS TO HELP SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL ABUSE BY ESTABLISHING SOME PROTECTIONS THE COURT CAN USE IN DETERMINING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING OFF INCURRING DEBT- YOU MAY KNOW THAT FINANCIAL ABUSE OCCURS IN IT CAN INCLUDE STEALING MONEY A CREDIT PROPERTY IN IDENTITY OF A ABUSED PARTNER. CAN ALSO INCLUDE FORCED A PARTNER INTO FILING FRAUDULENT LEGAL FILE FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS OVER SPENDING ON CREDIT CARDS THE PIECE OF PARTNERS CAN IN KERR DEAD WITHOUT AT SURVIVOR AND ABUSED PARTNER CAN OCCUR DAD WITHOUT OF SURVIVORS CONSENT- OR COERCED SO- SURVIVOR INTO INCURRING DEBT BY THREATS OF HARM. THIS DEBT AND THE CREDIT SCORE IMPACT COULD HAVE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR SURVIVORS PREEN BEARS TO EDUCATIONAL HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES SINCE THESE DEBTS ARE ENCOURAGED THROUGH THE ABUSIVE PARTNER STEALING THE SURVIVORS IDENTITY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SURVIVORS TO HAVE% THE TOOLS TO ACCESS EXISTING FEDERAL AND STATE PROTECTIONS FOR IDENTITY THEFT AND DEBT DEFENSE. CURRENTLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS ALLOW THE JUDGE TO ASSIGN SPECIFIC DEBT TO BE PAID BY THE RESTRAINT PARTY BY PATTING THE SPACE FOR THE JUDGE TO ALSO IDENTIFY WHICH DEBTS WERE INCURRED BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THROUGH THEFT OF SURVIVORS IDENTITY THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE SURVIVOR TO USE THE RESTRAINING ORDER AS DOCUMENTATION OF CIVIL DEBT RELIEF PROTECTIONS. AS WELL- THE COOPER NOT INTENDED MAKE HAS DEEP IN THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES THESE ECONOMIC VULNERABILITIES SURVIVORS AT RISK OF ANY FURTHER INTO POVERTY OR RETURNING TO THEIR USE OF PARTNER.

SO AS MENTIONED I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF ASSISTING FAMILY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS ON A DAILY BASIS AS A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR WE'VE IN SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA. ONE RECENT CLIENT I HAD WAS A ELDERLY WOMAN OUR FOR TWO AS OUT. NOW EL MARRIED. A MAN MORE FOR TO ASK OUR- AND SHE WOULD EVENTUALLY CALL HIM HUSBAND FOR OVER TEN YEARS. HE WAS HER HUSBAND WHEN HE CHASED HER AROUND THEIR HOME WITH A FIREARM. HE WAS HER HUSBAND WHEN HE TOOK A HAMMER TO. THE PORTION OF WALL JUST INCHES FROM HER HEAD. AND HE WAS STILL HER HUSBAND WHEN HE SHOWED UP TO HER SISTERS RESIDENTS IN A CHEAP DISGUISE. AND BRENT TO KILL HER AND HAD TO BE ARRESTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT HE WAS FOUND ARMED WITH A KNIFE. NOW EL NO LONGER CALLS ARE HER HUSBAND ANYMORE AND SHE'S DONE A LOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH HER LIFE BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT SHE CAN'T ESCAPE TO THIS DAY.

YEAH SO I'M I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH THE- WITH THE BILL- WHAT IS TRYING TO DO I THINK ONE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP IS. CERTAINLY I DON'T THINK THAT THE DEBT SHOULD APPLY TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM. BUT THAT DEBT SHOULD STILL 1100% APPLY TO THE ABUSER. SO ENSURING THAT. YOU KNOW YEAH THAT IS WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS. PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT ADDRESS THAT. AND THEY DON'T SIMPLY LIKE TO TAKE REALLY THE PERSON THAT. YOU KNOW COMMITTED THE ABUSE AND CREATED THIS FRAUD ESSENTIALLY SHOULD BE A 100% RESPONSIBLE THEN FOR THE DEATH AND THEN OBVIOUSLY I KNOW THE LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION IS BROUGHT UP SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. YOUR REAL PROPERTY AND- OBVIOUSLY THE LENDER. DOESN'T KNOW- YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING ON AND SO IF THERE LEAN MORE TO GET COMPLETELY INVALIDATED THAT WOULD BE A PROBLEM- YOU KNOW GOING FOR THAT SO MAYBE IF YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE ITEMS ABSOLUTELY NO APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO TAKE THAT ON- AND- YEAH OPPOSITION SHARED A RECEIVE THEIR- FEEDBACK ON FRIDAY AND WE'VE ALREADY BEEN IN COMMUNICATION AND- HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS- THEIR CONCERNS BEFORE.

FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SOMEONE MEMBER STONE. OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE OPEN THE PHONE LINES ON AB. TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. MR STONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY IS ABOUT COLLECTING. TAXES THAT ARE OWED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT HAVE NOT BEEN PAID THE CALIFORNIA FALSE CLAIMS ACT PROTECTS INCENTIVIZE IS WHISTLE BLOWERS TO DISCLOSE FRIED FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES AND OTHER ENTITIES WHO HAVE PERPETRATED FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS THAT THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO DEFER TO DETERMINE FEEL AND PUNISH THOSE WHO TO FRAUD THE PUBLIC. OF MUCH NEEDED FUNDS. IS A SPECIAL ACT BECAUSE IT IS PROVIDES FOR A TOOL. TO ENSURE THAT THESE TAX SCOFFLAWS OR IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION TO THE REASONABLE OR PROCESS. BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT THESE ARE THESE ARE SCOFFLAWS THAT WOULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED THROUGH NORMAL TAX PROSECUTION PROCESSES THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THE CALIFORNIA'S TACK AT TAX GAP IS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OWED BUT NOT ACTUALLY COLLECTED IT IS THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE TAKEN. THIS BILL CAME BEFORE US LAST YEAR. AND WAS SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT IN THE SENATE. AND WE'RE- WORKING THIS YEAR TO TRY AND GET THIS THROUGH AGAIN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO SEES THIS AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL NOW WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WERE MAKING SURE. THAT AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY FULL ONLY APPLIES WHEN THE YOUR THEIR CASES WHERE THE TAX PAYER KNOWINGLY KNOWINGLY SUBMITS FALSE FACTS TO THE GOVERNMENT SO THIS IS NOT. WHERE THERE'S A TAX POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITY THAT IS DISPUTED WHERE THERE'S A DISPUTE A FACTOR DISPUTE OF. OF INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX CODE THE TAXPAYER WULD HAVE HAVE TO KNOWINGLY SUBMIT FALSE FACTS THE GOVERNMENT. AND THE DAMAGES WHICH MEANS THE TAX LIABILITY WOULD HAVE TO BE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR MORE. SO WITH. TAXES THE NEAR PROTECT AGAINST FRIVOLOUS SUITS WERE ALSO PROTECTING THE TAX RECORDS OF THE- OF THE TAXPAYER IN THIS CASE BECAUSE ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE LOCAL JURISDICTION THE TAXING AUTHORITY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE TAX RECORD. UNDER A DAY KEEPS HIM SUIT THE WHISTLEBLOWER WOULD NOT THAT HAVE ACCESS IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE PROSECUTING FOR DECIDED NOT TO MOVE FOR WITH THE CASE. UNDER WHISTLEBLOWER ACT THEN THE WHISTLE BLOWER CAN USUALLY MOVE FORWARD UNDER QUI TAM. SUITS IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE TAX RECORDS SO WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LIMITING THIS TO TAXES TO SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS AN INTENTIONAL. WITHHOLDING OF TAX AND INTENTIONAL FALSE CLAIMS MADE TO THE STATE. THAT THE TAX LIABILITY IS HIGH ENOUGH. WE'RE NEW YORK STATE TEN YEARS AGO ENACTED SOMETHING SIMILAR AND IN THE ANNOUNCES YOU'LL SEE DISCUSSION OF THAT. NEW YORK STATUTE THAT IS PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE OVER THE TEN YEARS THEY HAVE PROSECUTED TO A TOTAL OF THIRTY CASES. AND WHICH IS. WHICH SHOWS THAT IT'S BEING USED SPARINGLY AND APPROPRIATELY AND YET THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAX LIABILITY. SO WITH THAT I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES I DO HAVE SOME WITNESSES WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES ON AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. FIRST WHAT IS.

PBLIC DOLLARS CONTACT FRAUD TO GET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND BY EXTENSION CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS MY COLLEAGUES MARIA ELENA COOKBOOK FOLLOWED ME TO EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE LEGISLATION. AND TRAINING TECHNICAL QUESTION SO I'LL BE BRIEF. THE YEAR AND BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS BE COVERED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA BOB THE FACT HAVE PROVEN THE VALUE OF THE ANTI CORRUPTION NOT. AB TWENTY FIVE THEN THE HEART OF THE POWER OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT TO UNCOVER AND PROSECUTE THEM OF THE AGREED TO TAKE OF THE TAX FRAUD. THE BILL DOES DRUG THING ALTHOUGH WITH THE BLOWER THAT WE APPRECIATE I NEED THEIR COURAGE AND STEPPING FORWARD AND COVERED LARGE SCALE FROCK. THE BILL THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIED THE HUGE IDENTIFIED BY OUR SUPPORT WHICH IF LEFT UNADDRESSED. COULD BE COPLEY THAT HAVE. TRY TO THINK OF CALIFORNIA TXPAYERS EXPECT OUR GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY WE MUST USE. EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO PROTECT THE STATE PROGRAMS THE THIRD THE I CAN TRY BUT TACTIC. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE RECOVERY OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BUT I THINK THE PRODUCT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE ASSOCIATION FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTY. WE GET CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE PICKED HER NAME THE BARGAIN I'D LABOR AMONG OTHER. FOR THESE REASONS THE FOR THE WRONG LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT THEY'RE AT AND WE URGE YOU TO VOTE I STAY AT THE AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY. AND NOW I'LL TAKE IT TO BRIAN CLEAN.

THAT THE CALIFORNIA BOTH PLANES ACTED AIMED AT UNCOVERING INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING FALSE CLAIMS COMPENSATING THE GOVERNMENT FOR FRAUD IN HEARING I THINK MANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY CLARIFY INSURANCE TING YEAH BUT THE MAIN CHANGE PROVIDE THE NEW AND EFFECTIVE TOOL TO THE CAVERN PROSECUTE. FRAUD THE ACT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE WE NEVER COVERAGE OVER ONE POINT EIGHT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM NON MEDICAID FALSE CLAIMS CASES IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL OF THE FILE CLAIMS UNITS WORK IS ENTIRELY SELF FUNDED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHARE OF THE RECOVERY INVOLVED CLAIMS THAT CASES. AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE TAX FRAUD- THE PACKING AGENCIES DO THEIR ABOUT THE CLOSE THE TAX GAP AND TO TRACK DOWN CHEATERS GIVEN THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE BUT THEY CAN ONLY GO AFTER THE TAX RIGHT THEY KNOW ABOUT. THIS BILL ALLOW THE TO GO AFTER THE HIT AND FRAUD THE CALIFORNIA PLAIN FACT INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE WITH INSIDE INFORMATION TO COME FORWARD WITH EVIDENCE OF FRAUD THAT WE WOULD NOT OTHERWISE HAVE KNOWN ABOUT BY OFFERING A MONETARY REWARD. OUR EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THE MONETARY INCENTIVE IS CRITICAL THINKER URGING INSIDERS TO COME ABOUT. BECAUSE FIGHTERS ARE FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED THE COMPANY COMMITTED FRAUD ONE WHERE THEY PUT THEIR LIVELIHOOD AT RISK FOR THE THREE OF THEM THE BILL ALSO STRENGTHENED THE ANTI RETALIATION PROVISIONS. IN THE ACT WE HAVE A DEDICATED AND HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THAT SPECIALIZES IN CASES INVOLVING FINANCE ACROSS CAN WORK HAND IN HAND. THE CAPITAL PRETTY TO PURSUE TAX. ANY YOUR TEXT DAMAGE POWER.

OF THIS JUST SYSTEM OF CAL. LIKE TO MISTER AND THANKING COMMITTEES FOR THE VERY VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS IT REALLY GOES THROUGH A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES THAT THE THAT THE BILL RAISES AND I'D LIKE TO STEP BACK AND APPROACH THIS FROM A LITTLE HIGHER LEVEL AND THAT IS IT A GOOD IDEA TO DEPUTISE PRIVATE COUNSEL TO DO ENFORCEMENT OF TAX LAWS. ASSUMING THAT EVERYTHING IN THE- ANALYSIS IS CORRECT I STILL THINK THERE'S AN ENORMOUS POLICY QUESTION RAISED BY BRINGING. IT SHOULD BE LAWYERS INTO BE FIRST MONTH OF- TAXATION- INTERESTINGLY WE HAVE A SERIES OF HIS OF LAWS WHICH ILLUSTRATE THE HISTORY HERE ALL OF WHICH WERE ADOPTED FOR VERY WORTHY PURPOSES YOU KNOW THE- ACCESS TO THE DISABILITY ACCESS LAWS. ABSOLUTELY WORTHY GOAL BUT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO ABUSE. A PROP SIXTY FIVE TOXICS DISCLOSURE VERY VERY WORTHY BUT ALL SORTS OF ABUSE OF PROP SIXTY FIVE ACTIONS. AND FINALLY- POP OUT THE ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR LAWS IS CRITICAL BUT THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS ABUSE IN THIS AREA AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SAME ABUSE HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO TAXES. YEAH MAY NOT BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SORT OF. AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT MORE SACRED THAN TAX LAW YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THE TAXES ARE BEING ENFORCED THE GET TAXPAYERS ENOUGH WHERE EVEN HANDED WAY. AND GIVING. PROF INSTEAD THAT I KNOW AND RESPECT THE PLAINTIFFS BAR BUT ARE VERY VERY AT I CANNOT. EVER READ UP. AS LONG AS THAT KEY TâM ELEMENT IS PRESENT AS TO TAXES IN THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT- INSTEAD YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT DO WE DO TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PAYING THEIR TAXES. AND THE ANALYSIS BY SHOWS YOU THE PASSWORD- THERE'S ONE PARAGRAPH IN THE ANALYSIS THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED THAT. AND IT. THE FRENCH TAX BOARD IN CD TFA HAVE MECHANISMS TO REPORT CAPTION BROUGHT UP FOR SOME REASON THE LEGISLATURE HAS NEVER SEEN FIT TO FUND A WHISTLE BLOWER ACT TO ALLOW THE FTP TO REWARD PEOPLE WHO COME FOR WORK IT'S SUCH A SIMPLE APPROACH AN EXISTING CURRENT LAW BUT IT ISN'T SIGNED IT AND AGAIN IT'S ON PAGE TEN WELL WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE CAPTION FOR SMART WEARABLE. THAT IS WHAT. THE AGENCY CHARGED WITH HIM FOR DE WHICH THEY VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND GIVE THEM THAT WHISTLE BLOWER INCENTIVE MONEY IT'S SELF EXECUTING IF NO ONE WOULD BROWN'S ANY WHISTLES IT WOULDN'T COST ANY MONEY AND IF THEY COME FORWARD AND- TO TAX CHEATS THOSE. PEOPLE ARE REFERRING TO THEM THEN THEY THEN THEY CAN BE REWARDED YOU COULD ALSO BUILD AND THE WHISTLE BLOWER PROTECTIONS THAT THIS BILL INCLUDES SO THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE MILLION THAT AND THAT WAS IN AB TWELVE SEVENTY LAST YEAR. GOES WAY YOU FUND A WHISTLE BLOWER PLAN YOU DON'T HAVE TAX LOOPHOLES AT A TIME- TO EMPLOYEE ROLES AT THE TIME THAT THE BUDGET IS CONSTRICTED. YOU ENFORCE THE TAX LAWS WHERE THEY BELONG AND IT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU FROM CURRENT LAW. SO WE WOULD SUGGEST RATHER THAN GO DOWN THIS ALBUM ESPECIALLY ON THE KEY YEAH. AND THE WITH BLOWER BUT GRAM AND SEE TIAS. AND SEE THAT WORKS. FOR THOSE THREE FOR A- AND I THINK WE WILL REMAIN OPPOSED AS LONG AS THERE IS FRANKLY A BOUNTY HUNTER PROVISION IN THE LAW.

THIS IS A BILL THAT IT SETS A MINIMUM. TAX LIABILITY REQUIREMENTS SO THAT DAY WE WON'T SEE THE KIND OF. FISHING EXPEDITIONS I THINK THAT OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED ABOUT IF YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK'S EXPERIENCE YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY VERY POSITIVE AND NONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED HAVE SURFACED IN UNDER THAT PROGRAM SOWE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS RESPONSIBLY AND COLLECT MONEY AT THE TIME WHEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE ARE GOING TO NEED.

HOLDEN KALRA- KALRA AYE KILEY ELLIE NO MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NO REYES HI RES I THAT'S GOT FOR BOTH. LEAVE THE RECORD OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO MR STONE. THANK YOU AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE IN THE ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACE THAT HAS BEEN BREWING FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT NOW UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AS THE MARKET PLACE A REPORT. DETAILS TOUR. AND THOSE STORES NOW WORK BUT YOU PRIOR MORE MORE PEOPLE WERE GOING ONLINE WE'VE WE'VE DEVELOPED AN ISSUE THAT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ONE FOR PROTECTING CONSUMERS FROM DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS WE HAVE A LONGSTANDING PRODUCT LIABILITY PRINCIPLES THAT ENSURE THAT WHEN A DANGEROUS PRODUCT IS SOLD TO A CONSUMER THERE IS A LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY. IS CARE THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN HOWEVER IN ONLINE MARKETPLACES MORE AND MORE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING THAT MARKET PLACE. DIDN'T NINE THAT LIABILITY AND AS- AS AS MARK THOSE WORK PLACES ARE BEING USED MORE AND MORE- IN THE CURRENT LOCKED OUT SITUATION AND AS MORE PRODUCTS ARE BEING SOURCED OFF SURE WHERE THE- MANUFACTURERS WERE THOSE DISTRIBUTORS OF THOSE PRODUCTS. ARE OUT OF THE REACH OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OR CALIFORNIA PRODUCT LIABILITY PRINCIPLES. CONSUMERS ARE LEFT. INJURED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WITH REMEDY SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IS IMPOSING ON THE ELECTRONIC MARKET PLACES THE SAME LIABILITY AS A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE WOULD SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. FROM THE SITUATION WHERE THEY PURCHASED ONLINE A PRODUCT THEY ARE INJURED BY THAT PRODUCTS. AND THERE IS NO OTHER REMEDY FOR THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT. BILL ANYWAY AS WE MOVE INTO A ENVIRONMENT WHERE WHERE CONSUMERS ARE PURCHASING MORE AND MORE ONLINE BUT- IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOW AS BRICK AND MORTAR STORES ARE GOING AWAY. AND NOT AS AVAILABLE WHERE WE ARE TRADITIONALLY SEE THE KINDS OF REMEDIES THAT THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD UNDER PRODUCT LIABILITY SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A VERY IMPORTANT BILL FOR CALIFORNIA. YEAH THE TWENTY TWENTY SITUATION THAT IS AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO WITNESS ISN'T SPORTS SHANE GUSMAN HERE IN PERSON AND DAVE CARPENTER WHO WILL BE ON THE PHONE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL THE TEAMSTERS UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS AND THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. FOR ALL OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS THIS BILL IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT PROTECTING THE PUBLIC- THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT ONLINE MEGA STORES LIKE AMAZON FOLLOW THE SAME RULES THAT BREAK THE BRICK AND MORTAR COMPETITORS FOLLOW WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. FROM DANGEROUS AND DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE CHAIR STATED. THIS IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY- NECESSARY GIVEN THE STATE WE FIND OURSELVES AND- WITH MUCH OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LARGELY SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF COVERED NINETEEN. CONSUMERS FIND IT MORE MORE NECESSARY TO GO ONLINE TO GET THE PRODUCTS THEY NEED- UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME IN THE SPACE THAT TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM. AND THAT PUTS CONSUMERS IN HARM'S WAY BECAUSE- AS YOU ALL KNOW. LIABILITY IN THIS AREA IS A POWERFUL INCENTIVE FOR CORPORATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY PUT OUT OF THE STREAM OF COMMERCE. ARE SAFE. WITHOUT THAT. THE INSIDE OF HIS LAST AND THE PROFIT INCENTIVE OVERTAKES. SO WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF BRINGING SOME RATIONALITY BACK TO THE SYSTEM AS MORE MORE PURCHASES MOVED ONLINE. AND SUPPORT THIS BILL- SHOULD BRING SOME RESPONSIBILITY BACK TO SOME OF THESE BUSINESSES AS WELL- AND TO ILLUSTRATE THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A THEORETICAL THING BUT- ACTION REAL PEOPLE REAL CALIFORNIANS- WE HAVE A WITNESS ON THE LINE THAT- CAN ILLUSTRATE HIS STORY FOR YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GROSSMAN MISTER CARPENTER ARE YOU ON THE LINE. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. PLEASE PRESS FIVE THANK YOU FOR THE- THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR DURING CHRISTMAS TIME IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- MY WIFE AND I DECIDED BY TO HOVER PUBLIC BOARD FOR MY DAUGHTER. WE ONE OF THE GOOD ONES WE RESEARCHED ONLINE- MY WIFE IN THE FINDING ONE ON AMAZON AMAZON AND SAW THAT MANY GOOD REVIEWS FIVE STAR REVIEWS. SO THAT WAS ONLY DECIDED BY WE TRUST THIS IS WE'RE BUYING ON AMAZON- WHICH IS A REPUTABLE COMPANY THAT THE STATE. BUT WEEKS LATER I WAS HOME I'M GETTING READY TO GO TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER FROM SOCCER- AT THE PLEASE TAKE MY DOG WITH ME IN THAT DAY I DID NOT TAKE MY DOGS LOVE PICKING UP THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT GIRLS. TIME SO I LEFT THEM HOME AND WHAT THE SOCCER FIELD WHEN I GOT THERE I SAW LIKE MS DOUBLE CALLS. SO I RETURN ONE OF THE CALLS FROM A NEIGHBOR OF MINE WHO WAS FRANTIC AND- SCREENING AT MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE. SO I PICKED UP MY DAUGHTER- WE DROVE BACK TO WE REALLY JUST FOR CONCERNED ABOUT THE DOG BEING IN IN OUR HOUSE. ARE YOU THERE OKAY SO WE PULLED UP TO OUR HOUSE HAD A PARK ABOUT A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY BECAUSE BOTH FIRE ENGINES IN. RAN DOWN THE STREET- FARMHOUSES. IN PLAIN STILL. AND SO I WAS LOOKING FOR THE DOG THE NEIGHBOR FRIEND OF MINE GRABBED ME AND AT. THE HELP ME BACK AND TOLD ME THE DOGS WOULD MAKE IT WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH THE FIRE. POINTED OUT THERE WERE- OUR FRONT LAWN. THAT COVERED BY PART MY DAUGHTER WAS UPSET. OF COURSE- SHE SOMEHOW THIS IS YOUR FAULT- WE TALKED TO A FIRE CHIEF AND HE SAID THIS WAS CALLED BY HOVER BOARD. IT'S YOU WAS A MECHANICAL DEVICE WHICH IN THE BEING THE BOARD WAS PLUGGED IN CHARGING DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM DOOR. ANY THIRD WE ARE ACTUALLY. WHAT HAPPENED NO WAY MADE OUT OF A PROBLEM SO WITH ALL LAST. BUT WHERE DO I LEARN THAT ON THE NEWS THE OTHER HOVER BOARD BALLING THEM IS ON EXPLODED ALSO CALLS FIRE. I ALSO LEARNED LATER THAT. ALTHOUGH WE BROUGHT BOB ON AMAZON BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY SOLD BY A THIRD PARTY COMPANY CHINA AMAZON NEVER TOLD US RE. OF BOARD THERE SAID IT WAS DANGEROUS THE FACT. AND NEVER US ABOUT OTHER WHICH BOTH BUT THE COST AMAZON DOES NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE I THINK WE DIDN'T SELL STOCK FOR. I'M TELLING MY STORY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TOSIXTY TWO. BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN ANYONE ELSE. ASSEMBLY OUT THAT IT WAS ON BE HELD LIABLE FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS WITH THIS ON THE WEBSITE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR STORY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO. DOES ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINE. PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO.

FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. I'M SORRY STRAWBERRY OPERATOR DID YOU SAY THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES A WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ROBERT CALLAHAN- BY TELEPHONE ON CHRISTMAS CHILI ALL IN PERSON. ROBERT CALLAGHAN. THANK YOU- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ROBERT CALLAGHAN WITH THE INTERNET ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE HERE OPPOSITION TO THE B. THIRTY TO SIXTY TO. AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO REFLECTS AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION OF STRICT LIABILITY AND RADICALLY DEPARTS FROM DECADES OF WELL ESTABLISHED PRODUCT LIABILITY LINE CALIFORNIA. PROPOSED BILL COMES AT A TIME WHEN BUSINESSES ARE ALREADY UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE AND WILL STIFLE THE ONLINE MARKETPLACE MODEL AT A TIME WHEN CONSUMERS AS WELL AS SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE INCREASINGLY RELYING ON THE CHOICE TO GIVE UNITS WHICH THIS MODEL PROVIDES. BUT CERTAINLY ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL CREE CONFUSION BY COMPARING OFFLINE SELLERS AND THE LIABILITY THAT THEY'RE UNDER TO ONLINE MARKETPLACES. BUT THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES A FAIRER MORE ACCURATE COMPARISON WOULD BE TO COMPARE OFFLINE SELLERS AND ONLINE SELLERS. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR ONLINE SELLERS ARE ALREADY UNIFORMLY LIABLE FOR STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY JUST LIKE ALL POINT SELLERS SO THIS IS NOT A DEBATE ABOUT DISPARATE TREATMENT BETWEEN THE OFFLINE WORLD VERSUS THE ONLINE WORLD. OUT AND LESS YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT THIS BILL ARE ONLY APPLIES TO ONLINE MARKETPLACES NOT TOO WELL POINT. THE PRIMARY QUESTION REMAINS THE FIRST TIME SHE CAL TREAT ELECT MARK. THE SAME WAY AS IT DOES SELLER. AB THREE TO SIXTY TWO MAKE THE OF AN ELECTRON MARKET STRICTLY LIABLE ALL. SOLD THROUGH THE MARKET PLACE THIS WORK REPLIED TO EVERY ONLINE BUSINESS LARGE AND SMALL THAT CONNECTS WILLING BUYERS AND SELLERS WOULD OPEN STRICTLY WHY I BELIEVE EVEN IF IT DID NOT MAKEON DISK YOU PROPER CELL. DESCRIBE HANDLED TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT- IT WOULD BE THE FIRST LAW OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY DOES HE KEEP SHIP THE PRODUCT LIABILITY WHAT THE WORLD SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES. ONE OF THE UNDERPINNINGS FOR A. B. THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO IS NOT THAT MARKET PLACES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS BUT THE MARKET PLACES SPREAD COST TO CROSS RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BUT DOES THAT. FORMER ACTUAL. COMMERCE BECAUSE MY- IF NOT ALL MARKET PLACES WILL PASS ON THE COST YOUR LIABILITY BILLION. PUBLIC SO. BACK TO PRODUCT AND THIS ONE TERM RESULT IN WIDESPREAD ARE DECREASING SO AT A RECENT PRIDE AT PRICES FOR PRODUCTS ON SUCH MORE PLACES YEAH WORDS WONDER MY VERY BAD THE MARKETPLACE WILL PROVIDE TICKETS WHY SELECTION WITH MY PRICE STOPPED. ALIVE RULE THAT SPREAD ACOSTA AND OTHER INNOCENTS OUR IS PLAY NOT REQUIRE ALREADY DOC AND ACHIEVE THAT AS A CALIFORNIA RECORDED ACOSTA BURKE RATIONALE DOES NOT SENSE WORKABLE MUTATION BUT OLD WINDOWS CONSUMMATE CONSERVE RESERVES INTENDED TO PROTECT AS AB THIRTY TO SIXTY TWO CLEARLY WHAT- THERE FOR DECADES LEGISLATORS IN EVERY STATE AND NEARLY EVERY U. S. COURT OF UNANIMOUSLY DETERMINED AFTER CONSIDERING ALL THE ROLE THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF GOING THE BENEFITS COST STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY SHOULD BE NARROWLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT EXPANDED. LEGISLATORS IN CALIFORNIA'S OF YET I RECOGNIZE EXPANSIONIST REPLY. ABILITY TO SERVICE PROVIDERS. OKAY DOES NOT ADVANCE THERE ARE UNDERMINED INTEREST CONSUMER DOES AND THE COMMUNITY. AFTER THESE REASONS MADE UP WE WOULD OR OF A TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MATTERS REGIONAL MANAGER MEMBERS CHRIS MCHALE ON WE HAVE A COMP IN ADDITION TO THE CAN OF MIKE JUST EXPRESS I THINK OUR CA IS THAT THIS IS A SICK DEPARTURE BECAUSE IT IMPOSES STRICT LIABILITY- REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ONLINE MARKET PLACE HAS POSSESSION OF THE PRODUCT- OR IF THEY ACTUALLY TOOK TITLE TO THE PRODUCT XL ITSELF WHICH IS WHY IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE. THE OTHER THING IS COURTS TODAY ALREADY HAVE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE ONLINE MARKET PLACE IS IN TROUBLE PART OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THAT DISCRETION BY THE COURTS A LOT HAS BEEN RAISED IN YOUR ANALYSIS- IN MY MISTER CHAIRMAN AS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL ABOUT- HOLDING RESPONSIBLE ALTERNATELY LIABLE THE STORE IN YOU FOR IN THE PERHAPS A MORE PRUDENT APPROACH RATHER THAN BE EASY EXPANSION OF STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY. IS TO EXAMINE CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM STATUTE AND WHETHER OR NOT CHANGES CAN BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE ARE SUFFICIENT CONTACTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THESE PEOPLE COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE CALIFORNIA COURTS AND I WOULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL AND THAT IS THE- CAR NOT TIME. WE DON'T WE DON'T IN THIS MESSAGE BUT CAL IS TOWARDS SYSTEM IS VERY. AND VERY AND AS MY COLLEAGUE THE PATH OF THE COST OF STRICT ULTIMATE GET PASSED ALONG TO BUSINESSES AND TO CONSUMERS ULTIMATELY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER KALING. ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. TO HAVE- A FEW ON THE PHONE LINES QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT. THANK YOU. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN ONE TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. JENNIFER BUT WE'RE ON THE ACT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE ONE THIRTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. MEMBERS OF MIKE BALOGUN BE HAVE THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND ONE MORE IS JUST QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT. OR ENJOY WHAT AT ALL BUT OFTEN. THANK YOU. THERE NO OTHER COMMENT ON PHONE LINES AT THIS TIME THANK YOU OPERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE THE PHONE LINE AND IT'S TIME ON IT. THIRTY TWO SIXTY TWO LET'S BRING IT BACK THE MAIN MR. THANK YOU I'M HAVE A SOME SYMPATHY WITH THIS I TO EXTENT THAT. WHEN YOU WERE SOMETHING ON AMAZON YOU CAN OF THINK OF IT GETTING FROM HIM RIVER OF THE- PARTICULAR COMP IS AND IT COMES IN THE- BY AND EVER BUT- YOU KNOW ON THE OTHER HAND I THINK. THE PURPOSE OF STRIP FRONT LIVE OR PRODUCT LINE LAW. IS NOT TO INCREASE CAUGHT. FOR VICTIMS TO MAKE IT SO THERE ARE FEWER SO THE WORK REDUCING THE COST OF. SO WHY WHAT'S THE MECHANISM BY WHICH IN ON LAW MARKET PLACE LIKE A COMPANY LIKE THAT. IS WELL SITUATED TO MINIMIZE ACOSTA ACCIDENTS. SURE THEN THAT'S A GREAT. AND REALLY THIS IS WHAT UNDERLIES THE NEED FOR THE BILL IS THERE THERE ARE. RETAIL RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE CREE IN A WAY THAT WHEN THE I. LAW WERE PASSED IN WHEN WE BUILT UP CONSUMER LAWS OVER THE YEARS. DID NOT CONTEMPLATE THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS THAT THERE ARE NOW. THE DISTRAUGHT THIS PLACE SO IT WAS ON IS IT IS A GOOD. GOOD CASE AND THEY A TREMENDOUS OF POWER IN THE MARKETPLACE IN THE INDUSTRY AND WITH THEIR VENDORS. AND BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR VENDORS LIKE IN THE CASE OF THE HOVER BOARD THE PERSON FLANK TO BURN DOWN THAT THE POOR MAN'S HOUSE. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO IN FOR. WITH THEIR VENDOR. PRODUCT QUALITY AND IT IN WAYS THAT NOBODY ELSE COULD. SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM MANUFACTURERS. AND RECORD MORTAR. RETAILERS WHO ARE TYPICALLY. ON WINE SHOULD SOMETHING GO WRONG. BECAUSE NOW WE HAVE OPENED UP POSSIBILITIES IN THIS NEW. ELECTRONIC ONLINE BROWN FOR. RELATIONSHIPS TO GO WELL BEYOND WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LONG ARM STATUTES COULD EVER REACH. IN THE CASE OF THE- OF WHERE TO GET A GOOD CASE. STAY ON THIS BECAUSE THAT COMPANY WAS REACHABLE. NOKNOWS WHO THEY ARE REALLY WHERE THERE LOW. AND THE ONLY ONE WHO DO. IT THE ONLINE MARKETPLACES TATER HOOK SET RULES FOR PARTICIPATION IN THAT MARKET PLACE AND IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO WHICH THEY DON'T SEEM WILLING TO DO THAT HOW ELSE DO REMEDY THE HARM IN THIS SITUATION SO TO YOUR POINT. IF WE'RE GOING TO RATED SENATORS. TO THAT THE IN FUSION SO. IS PLAYING THE WAY THAT THE PRICE WORKS WE THINK OF THE BREAKING AND THE NORMAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IF WE'RE GONNA CREATE AS SENT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE OPERATING IN A PLAY. WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SET. THERE IS ONE TO PROTECT THAT FOR THE END TO GO. THAT'S WHERE WE- THEM. TO BE MORE RESEARCH. TO WHOSE UP THROUGH THE MARK PLACE YEAH WE COULD HAVE PEARL. GO AND CHEAP GOOD THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE- YES CONSUMER WANT ACCESS TO THE TO THE- AW AND- THE- PRODUCT BUT THEY ALSO. THIS DAY AND AGE EXPECT A CERTAIN OF SAFETY IN THAT. WELL BECAUSE OF THESE TWO IS MY- THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT EXT. IS A FIFTY. IS REALLY LONGER THE AND I THINK THE COW. PUBLIC OTHER REALLY UNDER THAT AND THEY'VE BEEN. USE. TO SECTIONS SO MANY YEARS THEY HAVE THAT BASE SPEC TENSION. SO THIS IS THE WAY TO TRY AND MAKE FOR THAT. ALL OF THE WHO ARE GOING TO BE. SILLY KADING BRINGING PRADA IN CALIFORNIA TAKERS. FOR THE SAY OF THOSE PRODUCTS. I DO TO THAT POINT BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IS. WE AND YOU DEALING AN ONLINE. WITH DON'T HAVE. PHYSICAL OF THE PRODUCT ANY FOR IS A- RELATIONSHIP THE STREAM OF COMMERCE. THERE'S OF IN A BILL TO ENGAGE. IN QUALITY. SO IT'LL BE MORE AN INNINGS SO REQUIRE MUCH OF. MARGIN BUFFER SO THIS WHEN IT COMES TO PRODUCTS AREN'T SOME INTO HOT IN THAT LEAD TO THE- WE HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITE I THERE'S LOT OF YOU KNOW COMPANY ARE. SHOT OUT OF MORE. OR CALL RICA. BUT ARGUMENT. BECAUSE IF YOU BUY SOMETHING HAD A RETAIL STORE THEY CARRY ALL OF THAT OUR PUBLIC THAT'S BILL TO THE PRICE ANY SO THERE IS A NEW MAC THAT'S BEEN CRAY WITH THESE MARKETPLACE. THE IS THE IS NOW GOING A ALL OF THOSE ABA SO YEAH PRIDE CHEAP QUESTION IS SHOULD BE IS CHEAP AS IT IS NOW FACILITY BRINGING IN HARMFUL AS FOR THIS OF LOW COST WHEN THERE IS NO RED YEAH IT IS THE OPPOSITION CORRECT THIS IS A CHANGE BUT IT'S A CHIU THAT'S GOOD RESULT FROM. THE WAY THE ON MARK WORK AND THE THAT YOUR FACILITY THE MOVE OF GOOD THROUGH THE CONNECTION THAT THEY CREATE AND THE LAW IT'S A SPECIAL. OUR THEY HAVE POWER IS THE- TO BE TO ADDRESS THIS AND TO SO. AND SO IF I OPEN ADD TO HER WE THAT ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW THE JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY IS THAT THEY SHOULD GET OUT FROM LIABILITY SPECIALLY WHEN CAL. INJURE BUT THE LARGE THE COMPANY THEM. COMPANY THE MORE HE- POWER THEY- TO THIS. THEY THE ONES CLEAR. WHO SHOULD BE. ABLE AND- TO NOT NOT WILL BUT BE ABLE TO TAKE A RESPONSE. HERE AND HELP KEEP HEALTH SAY SOME SO I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT THEY NEEDS TO SOME OFFERED. FOR LAW. I GUESS WHERE I DISAGREE ISN'T WHEN YOU SAY THAT THAT YOUR BILL WOULD CREATE. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH THE BRICK AND MORTAR STORES BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME LIABILITIES RULES APPLY WHEN THERE'S A DIFFERENT ABILITY ENGAGE. IN QUALITY CONTROL SO WHAT LEVEL IN THE PLAYOFF PLAYING RIGHT. THAT DID BILL TO ENGAGE IN ANY CONTROL I SAID ALLOWING LIABILITY FOR AN M. BUT A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD OF THIS FOR LIABILITY STANDARD CLASSIFIED BILL HOW WE DONE PROUD I'VE BEEN IN. SO GET WITH THEIR THEIR- THAT'S UP. WE TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE AWAY. TO POTENTIALLY ABOUT THAT BUT- IF YOU AT HOW. AT ARE BEING MARKETED A THE WAY THAT IT ON ONLINE READ FUNCTIONS THEY DIFFERENTLY EVEN BRICK AND WORSE WHAT WHAT WE OF AS A AS A AND ALL LINE. MARKETPLACE AND THEY DO THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH BROUGH REACH AND THEY HAVE SET UP. SUCH AT BOTH BOTH FROM THE ACT WAS SIDE AND FROM THE CUSTOMER BASE SO THE LARGE THAT WORK. IS THE MORE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. HOW PRODUCTS MOVE THROUGH THEIR HOW AND HOW THEY MOVE THROUGH. AND SO OF THE CONCEPTS I STILL WOULD APPLY. BECAUSE THE COURTS ARE GOING TO LOOK AT. HOW MUCH A- RETAIL HAS IF GONNA PUT UP MY BECAUSE WHAT WHICH I USE CLAY. THAT WOULD THE SAME FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY FOR LIABILITY IN THE ONLINE MARK FROM AS IN. THE CURRENCY I THINK THAT THE MOST INTEREST. AND SO IT YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE WAYS TO BE A HOW WE'RE TO DO THE IN IN I SEE THE COURTS TO. OF THIS BE SIMILAR TO THEY'VE INTERPRET THE STRICT LIVE CASES WERE IT COMES TO. THAT THE OFF LINE BROWN AS WITH ALL ROW SO I KNOW THAT IT WORKS AS MUCH DE. AS THE FEAR IS THAT WORK. BUT YET THIS IS THE TO WRECK. THAT THE WORLD AND THE WAVE CONSUMERS. PURCHASE NEXT. RIGHT COOL IT'S THAT'S NEW SHOULDN'T ABSOLVE ANY FOR. THE TYPES OF. THAT THE HAVE. IF THEY WERE I LINE MARKET PLACE. THANK YOU THANK YOU KERN MR TRUMP ARE JUST FOR CLARIFICATION FOR. OUT THIS BILL HE NOT UP ON. MY ANY OF THE PROVISION REGARDING THAT'S EVEN FACT RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S STILL ON HOLD ACTUALLY. SO I CHECKED YEAH. UP NOW I AM. INTERESTED IN THE OF THE AT. US IS AS OPPOSED TO STRICTLY. OUR HEY I DO ANY FACT THAT YOU KNOW THE PRODUCT LIABILITY. I LOVE THE COMPANY THAT HAS YOU KNOW THE BIG BUCKS I GUESS YOU KNOW SO I THINK IT MAY MAKE SENSE FOR US TO KIND OF ALLOCATE THE- THE- OF. OF THE I MEAN- ALL COMPANIES DIFFERENT COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR- FOR THE TO HARM WITH THEM IS DONE I THINK YOU KNOW IN A SENSE IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT BUT YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M- WELL YEAH BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHICH IS. THE WHOLE REASON THE PRODUCTS I DISTRICT BY ABILITY IS BECAUSE THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD IS ALL OFTEN. UNDERSTAND IT ESPECIALLY WHEN. YOU YOU'RE LOOKING AT A DISTRIBUTION CHAIN HAD A PRODUCT MOVING THROUGH THAT AND SO. A COMPANY EIGHT. IS DISTRIBUTING A PRODUCT INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE AND THEY'RE THE ONLY. ORGANIZATION THAT HAS ANY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND THAT MANUFACTURE AS IS THE CASE WITH TALK ABOUT IS OUTSIDE OF THE REACH OF CALIFORNIA LAW. WHAT'S THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD ONCE WHEN THEY DIDN'T MANUFACTURER EIGHT THEY THEY DIDN'T TOUCH IT THEY DIDN'T SORT OF. HANDLE THAT PRODUCT SO. THAT I GUESS I'M OPEN TO THE CONCEPT BUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT FUNCTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT A PRODUCTS LIABILITY IS ESSENTIALLY STRICT LIABILITY BECAUSE- WE DON'T. IF WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED. IN THE IF WE START DOWN INTO THAT NEGLIGENCE QUESTION IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE- WHAT THE VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS ARE IN IN WHAT THE VARIOUS LIABILITIES ARE GOING TO BE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MANUFACTURERS. DISTRIBUTORS BRICK AND MORTAR STORES THAT IN THIS CASE TRANSLATE THIS TRY TO TRANSLATE THIS INTO THE ON RIGHT. ON MY AROUND. OUR ENSURING THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE SAFE AND ARE NOT GOING TO HARM PEOPLE AND THAT WAS CALIFORNIANS MOVE MORE TO THE ONLINE ROOM I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. TO LOOK AT THAT ONLINE ROUTE. AND ENSURE THAT THE SAME EXPECTATIONS OF PRODUCT SAFETY AT THE SAME INCENTIVES FOR MANUFACTURERS AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE UP THE CHAIN. EXIST SO THAT WE'RE NOT NOW BRINGING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF. LOW COST ITEMS BRING DANGEROUS ITEMS INTO CALIFORNIA. THANK THANK YOU MISTER JOE ANY OTHER MEMBERS. GONZALEZ FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING SOMEWHERE IN- COULD NOT QUITE GET TO WHAT WE NEEDED- I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT AMAZON NOW HAS 50% OF ALL ONLINE SALES- ARE COMING THROUGH THAT AS OF MARKET PLACE- SO THOUGH IT SURE POWER OF ONE COMPANY- TO BE ABLE TO BRING US. TAKING SOME AS WELL- I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE AS IT MOVES FORWARD MS FLORIDA I'D LIKE TO KNOW JUST HOW AUTHOR IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. WITH THAT I'M OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MAY. NO SECOND MOTIONS SECOND MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I'D LIKE TO PIGGY BACK. CHAIRMAN STONE ON SOME COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE IN RESPONSE TO A PREVIOUS QUESTION. YOU KNOW I FEEL KIND OF FEEL LIKE WE AS WE TALK ABOUT BOTTOM LINE COMMERCE AND THE GIG ECONOMY THAT WE WANT TO SOME WAY SOMETIMES MAKE IT LIKE A BRICK AND MORTAR MAKE IT LOOK LIKE BROKEN OR BUT IT'S NOT IT IS A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT MECHANIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INTERESTING SITUATION HERE WHERE. A MARKET PLACE IS FUNCTIONING AS A CONDUIT BETWEEN WILLING BUYERS ARE WILLING SELLERS AND THAT PHYSICAL MATERIAL NEVER PASSED THROUGH THE CHAIN OF POSSESSION OF THE MARKETPLACE ITSELF SO I MEAN IT REALLY ISN'T LIKE AN ONLINE RETAILER WE AND THIS BILL IS KIND OF REPORTING TO TREAT IT LIKE AN ONLINE RETAIL. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A BIGGER CONCERN THAT I HAVE THAT WHICH IS THAT. YOU KNOW IN IN THIS CASE IN IN THE TESTIMONY WAS JUST COMPELLING. ABOUT THE FORTUNATE WITH THE LOST HIS HOME I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S- IT'S EASY TO FIND TO IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE TO LOSE YOUR HOME THAT WAY. AND CLEARLY IT WAS AS A RESULT OF A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT BUT- WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AMAZON ACTUALLY. WAS NEGLIGENT IN THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FACTS BUT- ITS CLEAR THAT IF YOU HAVE AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE. EVEN IF. YOU HAD A FULL TIME STAFF DEDICATED TO- TO TRYING TO ENSURE THAT USUALLY SHIP A QUALITY PRODUCT. EVEN IF YOU DID EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY DO TRYING TO AVOID THE SITUATIONS THAT PERIODICALLY UNFORTUNATELY SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN. SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S CLEAR THE DID YOU KNOW THIS IS GOING TO RAISE COSTS FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO WAY. THEY COULD. HE QUESTION. THAT WE IS WHETHER OR NOT. THE AMOUNT THAT WE RAISE THE STRAW IS WORTH THE PUBLIC. BENEFIT THAT WOULD RESULT IS WRITTEN. FOR RAISING THOSE COSTS- AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY ONE LAST THING ABOUT THE ABOUT WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT ON AMAZON. YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW THEY'RE THEY HAVE THIS MARKET. YES IN THIS BILL AND THIS IS WHAT I LIKE YOUR REACTION TO- I THINK THE PASSING THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT DOMINANCE- EVEN WORSE. REASON IS BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE PUT RESTRICTIONS ON A FREE MARKET WE RAISE THE BARRIER TO ENTRY. TO COMPANIES THAT WISH TO ENTER THAT MARKET IN IN IN CALIFORNIA IF THIS BILL BECAME LAW- I WOULD THINK THAT WE ARE. TELLING EVERYBODY THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN OPEN AN ONLINE MARKET MARKET PLACE IN CALIFORNIA IS IF YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF ONE OF THE INSURANCE AND IF YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL. STAFF SINGLE PRODUCT THAT YOU. IT IS THAT WILL SAYING IS IT'S SURE SEEMS LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING WITH THIS BILL WELL TO IT TO YOUR FIRST POINT ABOUT THE NEGLIGENCE OF SURVEILLANCE. I THINK. I BELIEVE STREET LEVEL. SOME OF THE THOSE QUESTIONS TO YOUR SECOND ONE I THINK A LOT OF THAT SHIP IS ALREADY SAILED THAT GIVEN AMAZON'S DOMINANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE THEIR 50% OF ON LINE RETAIL NOW SOMEBODY WHO IS A- A PLACE TO IS SELLING ON SELLING THEIR PRODUCT ONLINE THERE'S BUDGET THEY'RE SELLING ONLINE DOESN'T GET THEM OUT OF ANY OF THAT THE LIABILITY THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN. WE'RE NOT REALLY EVEN WATCHING. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. APPLYING A SENSE OF. LIABILITY PRODUCTS LIABILITY. IN A WAY THAT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ALREADY UNDERSTAND AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT THEY GET INTO ONLINE BROWN THAT SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO SKIRT THAT LIABILITY AND THOSE OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT IS THEY DO BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY THEY'RE JUST MERELY FACILITATING THE THAT TRANSACTION BUT YEAH TYPICALLY THE ONES WHO HAVE THE BEST IN THE STRONGEST. ABILITY TO. SAVE NOT. INTO THE CALIFORNIA MARKET SO FOR THEM TO STEP BACK AND SAY LOOK WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ESPECIALLY COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON WHICH IS TRYING TO. FACILITATE WILLING BUYERS AND WILLING SELLERS AND YET GIVEN THEIR MARKET SHARE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY MAKE ON ALL OF THESE TRANSACTIONS THEY'RE OPENING UP THE FLOODGATES OF DANGEROUS PRODUCTS COMING IN THE CALIFORNIA. WITH OUR PAR ABILITY TO HAVE ANY SAY OR TO DO WITH THAT. WITH ANY REMEDY SHOULD SOMEONE BE INJURED SO I THINK YES WE'RE NOT EXACTLY TRYING TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO TREAT BOTH EXACTLY THE SAME BUT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THESE KINDS. AN EMPLOYMENT ONLINE BROWN IN AN ONLINE WORLD THAT HE IS. FUNCTIONING HE'S VERY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT ECONOMY CALIFORNIA SUPPORT TO THE WAY CONSUMERS GET PRODUCTS BUT IS LEAVING THOSE CONSUMERS. VERY VULNERABLE TO INJURIES WITHOUT RENDON SO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CRAZINESS REMEDIES GIVEN THEN THE CHANGING NATURE OF HOW CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ARE EXPECTING TO ACQUIRE THEIR PROBLEM SO WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE SITUATION YOU JUST TALK ABOUT WHERE- YOU'VE GOT AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE MARKET PLACE IS JUST A CONDO. FOR A RELATIONSHIP TO LINK UP OF OUR BEST SELLERS. I MEAN IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO CHANGE IN POSSESSION OF THE GOOD IS BEING SHIPPED THE MARKET PLACES EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT HEY LOOK WE'RE JUST MATCHING YOU GUYS UP. IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR BILL DOES NOT MAKE IT CAPTION FOR THAT I DON'T REALLY SHOW IT DOESN'T BECAUSE THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE SEEING ESPECIALLY WITH LARGER ONES. THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACH FULLY AND TO REACH COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURE. WHO DON'T HAVE A CONTEXT CALIFORNIA. OR CALIFORNIA. FOR THAT THE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REMEDY A WRONG IF THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO BRING A DANGEROUS PRODUCT INTO CALIFORNIA. THEN YES THEY SHOULD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FACT THEY HAVE NOW PRODUCED A DANGER. FOR WITHOUT ROAMING. OKAY WELL LET ME THAT THIS IS THIS ILLUSTRATE MY BIG WITH BILL THAT YOU KNOW THE IF YOU LOOK BACK ON ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE LAST YOU KNOW FOUND YEARS THAT HAVE POWER WELL THE INTERNET IS RIGHT UP THERE AND IT'S A POWER PEOPLE BECAUSE IT. THIS TRADE OF INFORMATION THAN. OURS AND TO TREAT IT LIKE. A BRICK AND MORTAR. TYPE OF TO. I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY DEFEAT THE PURPLE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED WITH WITH THAT FREE FLOW OF COMMERCE SO- I'LL BE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION YEAH AND THEN THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. BUT IT'S BE BECAUSE- IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE RELYING MORE AND MORE ON IN THE INTERNET IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF AN EXCUSE TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH REGULATIONS FROM. TO AVOID THE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU KNOW WHERE THIS IS THIS IS NEW IT'S INNOVATIVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT. THAT THAT'S FACILITATING WHATEVER IN A CATEGORY YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO SO THEREFORE DON'T HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE WELL NOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY IS INJURED AND THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY THE LAW HAS GET LOST GET WRITTEN AND SOCIETIES FIGURE OUT HOW TO STRUCTURE THAT BACK IN ORDER TO FIND. A RESPONSIBLE PERSON AND A PERSON WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT INJURY IN THE IN FACT THAT THEY CREATED THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THEY ALLOW THAT PRODUCT TO GET SO WE HAVEN'T HAD QUESTION BECAUSE NOBODY'S HAD THE GLOBAL. ADD SOME THAT ENABLES ON WAR THESE MARKETPLACES HALF SO IT IT IS A NEW WORLD. AND JUST FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT. RESPONSIBILITIES SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE IF THEY'RE GONNA PARTICIPATE IN THAT ROUND. DOESN'T MEAN THAT ARE UNDERMINING THE INTERNET OR GOING TO DO AWAY WITH THE INNOVATIONS OR THAT THE WAY THAT THAT IT FUNCTIONS BECAUSE- WE COULD GO BACK DAYS WHERE WHERE THEY NOBODY WAS RESPONSIBLE IF SOMEBODY PURCHASE PRODUCTS AND THAT PRODUCT INJURED SOMEONE. THAT'S WHAT THE REGULATORY SCHEME WAS WHERE THE STRICT LIABILITY CAME IN WAS TO WAS TO INCENTIVIZE IN MAKE SURE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MOVING INTO CALIFORNIA SKATED TO OUR- PLAY. ARE THEY SAVE AND I DON'T HAVE INCENTIVES NOW WE'RE JUST GO TO BE MOVE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE GOING TO HARM PEOPLE AND THAT HAS COSTS TO OUR SOCIETY TOSS OR COMMUNITY COST OF HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS IS A COVERAGE XIN WITH HAVING AND US TO BE UNDERSTOOD SO I'M- WOULD I WOULD AGREE BUT THAT ENDED AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK THE SUMMER WEBER- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AS SO MANY YOU KNOW I WORKED AS A THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE AND THOUGHTS% FROM- THE OPPOSITION. ALTHOUGH THEN APPRECIATE THIS THE SHARING OF THE COMMITMENT TO ROOT OUT RACIAL BIAS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THAT SUGGESTING THAT- THAT THE BROUGH INCLUSIONS OR ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES OF BIAS I'M- AS AS REFERRED TO- IN THE SUMMARY OR THROUGH STATEMENTS OR THE POSITION OF DOCTOR WEBER I THINK- FLIES IN THE FACE OF COUNTLESS STUDIES. THAT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE BIAS RADICAL JUST SYSTEM AND SPECIFIC TO THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS. I'M CERTAINLY SEEN IT FIRST HAND IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A BIGGER JOKE TO HAVE TO DO ABOUT HER HEARING COULD YOU KNEW YOU WOULD NOT GET A GRANTED. AND THAT ON APPEAL IT WOULD NOT BE A GRANTED EVEN THOUGH- THEIR EXPLICIT EXAMPLES OF BIAS IN TERMS OF ROOTING OUT PEOPLE OF COLOR. PRINTER. WE KNOW THE BATON WE HERE TO PROCESS DOESN'T WERE TO WITHOUT RACIAL. IN THE JURY SELECTION AND SUGGEST IT DOES PLEASANT FACE THE FACTS OF WHAT WE SEE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS- DIRECTION IT THAT IT RECOGNIZES IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE I THINK I WAS A BODY OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE FINALLY STARTED TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY ONE THAT HAS MORE. IMPACTS FROM BIAS THAN PRETTY MUCH ANY OTHER INDUSTRY I CAN THINK OF IN OUR SOCIETY- AND IT USES FACIALLY NEUTRAL REASONS- THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY ASSOCIATED. WITH PROTECTED GROUPS. AND IT INTENTIONALLY THAT PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE PARTY EXERCISING. THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE. THE CURRENT PROCESS PASSED. A JUDGE DETERMINED THE STATE OF MIND OF A PROSECUTOR. BASED ON DEMEANOR AND CREDIBILITY. NOW I CAN TELL YOU BASED UPON BEING AN IMPORTANT. OF FOR MANY YEARS THAT. THE REAL LIFE APPLICATION OF THAT IS ASKING THE PROSECUTOR WERE ASKING THE JUDGE. TO ESSENTIALLY TOLD ROSECUTOR THAT APPEARS A FOR THEM ALL THE TIME. THAT YOU'RE USING RACIST OR BIGOTED JUSTIFICATION AND YOUR- YOU SOME. DOESN'T A REAL. TERMS OF HOW COME TO HUMAN NATURE THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE JUDGES ARE LIKE THE COMFORTABLE DOING THAT ON A ROUTINE BASIS. THAT'S WHAT THIS. USING CHECK THE RESERVIST. ACTUALLY ALL. A JUDGE OF TO HAVE THE- NECESSARY TO USE IMPLICIT BIAS THAT EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY. TO ENSURE THAT EVERY JUROR HAS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THE- WITHOUT. CASTING CASTING ANY ASPERSIONS ON A PROSECUTOR OR OTHER PARTY. OR ATTORNEY THAT MAYBE USING A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE DEEMED BIASED. AND SO- I WOULD HEAR IT ALL THE TIME IN TERMS A WORD SOMEONE NEIGHBORHOOD THEY LIVED IN. CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OR HAVING RELATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR INCARCERATED OR DATUM CELLS ARRESTED OR INCARCERATED OTHER JUDGES BUT THE COME JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT WE WANT A JURY A TRUE JURY OF ONE'S PEERS. TO BE ABLE TO BE A AS A JURY INCOME OF QUE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JURORS THAT ARE BEING SEATED HAVE A CROSS SECTION OF. THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE AND SO THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT IT IS AND WOULD BE. A THE SHIFT BUT IT'S A SHIFT OF BASED UPON. THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT OUR SOCIETY HAS HAD SINCE ITS INCEPTION. SINCE THE CONCLUSION OF SLAVERY WE'VE SEEN COME THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS CONTINUED THE RACIAL ANIMUS- THAT HAS EXISTED THAT IS NOT A FAULT YOU CAN'T POINT ONE PROSECUTOR. OR IN THE DO YOU SEE YOUR- ON THE BECAUSE OF THE- BUT THE DA AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S THE JUDGES HAVE TO BE THE SOLUTION. AND IN BEING EXPLICIT AND MOVING OUT THIS RACISM AND SO- THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND HOPE. THAT WE CAN. MOVE IT FOR TODAY- BECAUSE I THINK IT. SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE THAT ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING EXTRA ABOUT ROOTING OUT RACISM PROBLEM IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. THANK YOU MISTER HOLD. BUT I LIKE TO TAKE A DOCTOR WERE FROM BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AS WELL- I CAN. ADD TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS JUST DESCRIBED IS REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL WHY THIS BILL WORTH SUPPORTING I THINK IT'S ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DIVERSE- JURY POOL. THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR PEERS. AND THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY IS AS I UNDERSTAND IT. IS CALLING FOR THE NEED TO GIVE A RATIONALE BEHIND ONE PERSON IS BEING DISMISSED AND I THINK THAT THAT- SEEMS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND FAIR APPROACH FOR THE RECORD TO REFLECT. AND SO WITH THAT. OUR PRESENTATION SOCIAL BRING BAD BILLS SO- I'M SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL AND LOOK FORWARD TO. DEVOTING FORD ON THE FLOOR AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR. I WOULD LIKE TO BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CALL. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. YEAH SO. YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING OF. YOU KNOW WHAT PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES ARE TRYING TO GET IS ACTUALLY TO GET AT. YES THAT MIGHT BE AN INJURY. AND GIVE THE PARTIES BOTH SIDES THE ABILITY TO PASS FOR JURORS TO BE EXCUSED IF THEY THINK THE- THERE'S GOING TO BE BIAS IN THE DECISION SO. ON THE VERY BEGIN OF WHERE WE START I THINK THIS PROCESS IS IN PLACE IN ORDER TO HELP ENSURE A FAIR. AN UNBIASED JURY SYSTEM. I DO GET THE CONCERN THAT IS BEING BROUGHT WITH THIS WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT WOULD WITH THE WITH THE REVERSE BE TRUE. LET'S SAY THE- DEFENSE WANTS TO DO A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE TO JUROR THAT IS EXPRESSED THAT THEY ALL THAT THEY TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IMPLICITLY. AND THAT THEY'VE NEVER HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE AND ALWAYS FOLLOW THE LAW. MY TO DEFEND IT SAY WELL THE DEFENDANT. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAY WELL HEY I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS PERSON. IS GOING TO BE UNDULY BIASED AND SO I'M GOING TO ISSUE A CHALLENGE. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW WOULD ALLOW THAT SO I MEAN IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT IN THIS INSTANCE TO WE ALSO PRECLUDE THE ABILITY TO. THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES AND- IN THE REVERSE. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT- AND I AND HAVING BEEN. QUESTION FOR JURY DUTY MANY MANY TIMES- CLEARLY- IF YOU'RE ASKING WHAT THE NOT THE PERSON IS GOING TO BE- BIAS AGAINST THE FULL CASES ONE THING AND THAT THAT MAY BE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT VERSUS SOMEONE ELEVEN CAN YOU BASED ON YOUR THIS YOUR GENDER. OF MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON WHO YOU ARE YOU NATIONAL DEPTHS IF AUTOMATE THE OPPOSED TO NOT ASK ABOUT BUT BASICALLY BECAUSE- THE DENTAL FIVE THOSE CARE RISK. THAT PART OF GENTLY OF THE EIGHT WITH THAT IF YOU ASKING WHAT LIVE DOES DOES THE BLACK THE TO LIVE ON DETERMINE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARD LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT YOU THAT QUESTION- ASKING YOU HAVE YOU HAD ANY RELATIVES EVER ARRESTED- AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE WHOLE JURY POOL BEING ASKED THAT QUESTION I'VE HAD THE CHANCE OF ME- AS IF TO SAY YOU'RE- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OF THAT WOULD. I'M INTERESTED IN. IN IT SO THERE'S BY THAT IN THE YEAR THAT ARE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM NOW WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WHO BUILT THE SYSTEM FIRST OF ALL. AND WHAT THE SYSTEM IS TO. BEING OUT OF THE- OF THAT THEY MAY HAVE A HANSARD MAKES. AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE MAYBE OPEN MINDED BUT IT NEVER RELEASED WHAT THEY MEAN BY OPEN MINDED OBVIOUSLY IS VERY CLOSE MINDED IN TERMS OF THEIR PERCEPTION LAW. AND THE KIND THINGS THAT THAT THE- WHERE. A QUESTION OF OTHER BARBIES CHALLENGES BASICALLY BASED ON A PERSON'S RACE THEIR ETHNICITY THEIR GENDER ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WOULD THEN PRECLUDE YEAH. NEVER MIND BE ON THE JURY IT'S- AND- ASKING A PERSON THAT QUESTION MAYBE FOR AS YOU SAY PROBABLY IS WHITE. IF THEY HAVE OF YOU KNOW THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS US THOSE PARTICULAR CASE BEEN JURIES WHAT I'VE ASKED EVERYBODY SAID BECAUSE IT IS ON. ONE KNOW WHO AT ANY ANY KIND AT ALL. AND THAT HAVE SOME RELEVANCE BECAUSE OF A CASE THE REALLY WELL ABOUT IN. IN AND THEY ASK EVERYONE NOT JUST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN- WHO WORK BASICALLY OF COLOR OR WOMEN WHO THEY THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BENEFITTED OR NOT. SENATE FROM SOMEONE SHOULD. I THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR **** THEM THAT WOULD BE TO IN THE COURSE. BUT WHAT WAS SIMPLY SO IS THAT IF YOU'RE ASKING CHALLENGED AND IF SOMEONE IS COUNTING BASED ON RACE GENDER OR CLASS THEN YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU WHY YOU. WHY YOU COULD ASK THE QUESTION WHAT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT HAS TO BE- INTENTIONAL VERSUS- UP. TO A BASICALLY THE BOX IS THE INTENDED BIAS. THAT'S. THE QUESTIONS THAT. YEAH AND IT WAS PERFORMED NUMBER BEEN THAT BASE PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM SERVING ON JURIES NOT DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS ALREADY ADMITTED THAT HE BELIEVES THERE'S ON THAT THERE ARE THERE IS UNCONSCIOUS BODY AND WE'VE HAD THAT THAT WE'VE HAD THE DEBATE. FOR MANY. ABOUT ONE OF LOS AND LAW IS NOW SAYS IS WE HAVE ONE INTENT BIAS SIMPLY IT KNOWLEDGE IN YOU HAVE IT IS NOT SO. IN ITSELF BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF BUT IN. A LOT JUST AS- AT THE STATE AS HE AS AS INTO. BY IN TERMS OF A PERSON LIFE. AND WOULD BE HAPPY IN THE- THAT WE MAKE. RIGHT SO I APPRECIATE. BUT AGAIN I THINK WE'RE- WE ARE MIXING THINGS UP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN I MEAN IF IT WAS INTENTIONAL AND SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE OFF THE JURY BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE NATIONAL ORIGIN THAT SELF ALREADY CONSTITUTE. SO THAT I MEAN CURRENT LAW ALREADY DEALS WITH THAT SITUATION. BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT IS A IS THERE SOME SORT OF PRE TAX IS THERE SOME SORT OF THING IS BEING USED TO. COVER UP THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL IS WERE SAYING HEY THESE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN ONLY THESE QUESTIONS WILL ASSUME THAT THOSE ARE PRETEXT. AND I THINK THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE'RE SAYING FOR YOU IF YOU HAD A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THAT'S PRETEXT. FOR RACE. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT NECESSARILY IS YEAH- ASKING IF YOUR FAMILY MEMBER YOU KNOW WAS CONVICTED OF A CRIME. YOU'LL BE THE REVERSE IS TRUE THE DEFENSE IS GOING TO ASK DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER LONG FORSMAN. YEAH TE DEFENSE IS GOING TO ASK YOU NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR CONNECTIONS TO. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE LAWS WELL AND IF THEY FEEL LIKE THERE'S- SOMETHING THERE THEY'RE GOING TO EXECUTE A PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE IS THAT IS THAT QUESTIONS BEING ASKED BASED ON RACE GENDER. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT ALL THESE QUESTIONS ON THE OUTSIDE OR NOT BE YOU KNOW IN THAT WAY OKAY RIGHT- BUT WE'RE ONLY WITH YOUR LEGISLATION WE'RE ONLY SAYING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS THE ONES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR BILL AUTOMATICALLY SUSPECT DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY SUSPECT ONLY IF SOMEONE OBJECTS. TO THE QUESTION THEN IT'S BECOME THEN YOU HAVE TO JUSTIFY WHY YOU HAVE Y. U. S. THAT QUESTION RIGHT BUT YOU CAN ONLY OBJECT ON THOSE QUESTIONS AND WE DON'T ALLOW THAT FOR OTHER OTHERS AS WELL I MEAN I THINK OF PERSON MAKES AN OBJECTION BASED ON. THE IT DISCRIMINATION ON THESE PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS THEN IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE PERSON MAY BE WHO. WHO'S BASICALLY MAKING THE CHALLENGE TO JUSTIFY WHY IT IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY BASED ON THOSE OF RACE GENDER OR OUR- OUR SEX. WHAT IS SAYING THAT THEY HAVE TO BASED ON THAT IT. THEY DON'T RATE ISSUE THAT IS THAT IT'S NOT DISCRIMINATE THEN WOULD NOT HAVE TO IT. NOW WORK THAT'S BEEN IN WASHINGTON SHOWS AS SOME WOULD SAY WITH THIS TIME REPORTS FOR EVER- THE WORK DONE IN WASHINGTON SHOWS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE FEWER. CAKE IS BASICALLY BEING CHALLENGED BECAUSE PEOPLE BECAME CONSCIOUS. OF THE QUESTION THEY WERE GOING TO ASK AND AS A RESULT OF THAT DID NOT REALIZE THAT THEY NEEDED TO FILL TO THEMSELVES AND- TO THEIR OWN BIASED. TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T ASK THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT HAVE NO RELEVANCE. TO THE CASE. OF SO AS A RESULT OF IT ACTUALLY DID NOT EXTEND TO BE ON THE BUT IT PUTS CISCO A- MINDSET THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THAN SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN- BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE INTENT. OFF TIMES IT HAS SUCH A BIG READ SAYING THAT YOU SEE. OFTENTIMES WE O THINGS WITHOUT NECESSARILY WITH WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT DOING IT BECAUSE OF THE- BIAS THAT THAT ONE ALREADY. TOO AND THE SYSTEM IN WHICH WE EXIST CAUSES US TO DO THESE THINGS. WITHOUT ACTUALLY THINKING ABOUT THE STUFF THAT WE DO. IN THE END THE IMPACT IS THE SAME. IT'S ALMOST LIKE BEING IN A CLASSROOM WHERE TEACHER TARGET CERTAIN KIDS WHO SHE BELIEVES IS GOING TO BE OUT OF CONTROL. YOU HAVE CERTAIN THINGS AS A RESULT. PART OF. I ASKED THE DOT TO THE- NET YOU MAY NOT. BUT SHE HAS A BIAS IN THESE YEAH MEN HER CLASS BUT THE IMPACT IS THE BECAUSE MISSING AND I DIDN'T BENEFIT IN STOCK AND THEY'RE BEING OVERLY OF CHRIS. COMPARE TO THEIR PEERS WE SEEN THAT TIME AND TIME IN SCHOOL IN CLASS SO THE BUYER ISSUE THE UNINTENDED. IS JUST AS DON'T AS INTENDED BY AND THIS IN THIS BASICALLY DEALS WITH WITH THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT I GUESS THE PROBLEM WITH. WITH THE CURRENT BILL AS WRITTEN IS. IT'S SORT OF CALLING OUT ONLY CERTAIN QUESTIONS AS BEING POTENTIALLY SUBJECT TO OBJECTION. THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT CAN WE GET. IN AND LOOK AT TENNIS HARD TO PROVE I MEAN IT AND MANY. YES EXACTLY WHY THIS BILL IS BECAUSE INTENT IS HARD TO DO IN MANY CASES YOU KNOW AND ARE IN GOING THROUGHOUT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YOU EVEN TRYING TO PROVE- YOU KNOW. CERTAIN CRIMES YOU HAVE TO PROVE INTENT. AND CERTAINLY THAT IS IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT GOES IN AND BUT AS WE'RE GOING INTO THIS DISCUSSION WITHOUT HAVING THIS- STUDY EVEN COME BACK YET FOR INSTANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT AND JUST SORT OF ARBITRARILY DETERMINE DETERMINING THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS OF THE STAIRS BACKED. I DON'T THERE'S A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THAT. THAT'S WHY I CAN'T I CAN'T SUPPORT YOU KNOW THE BILL AS IT'S PRESENTED. TIME IS CERTAINLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR JURIES ARE UNBIASED BUT I UP BUT AGAIN ARGUE THAT'S PART OF WHY WE HAVE PRINT THREE CHALLENGES. IS SO THAT. IN BOTH SIDES ASKING NO NOT UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN ASKED A SPECIFIC QUESTION IN BOTH SIDES ASKING QUESTIONS OF JURORS. THEN THEY CAN MAKE A CHALLENGE THAT JUROR IS SAYING HEY I THINK THIS PERSON ISN'T GOING TO BE- FAIR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE UNBIASED IN MAKING A DECISION AND THE JURY AND I. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IS A GOOD WAY OF DETERMINED THAT- SO. I'M HESITANT TO MOVE FOR WITH THIS. ALSO WITH WITHIN THE TIME FROM THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE A STUDY COMING BACK TO STUDY IN THIS VERY ISSUE- AND ONE THING SIR WE DON'T HAVE AS- OUR HEARINGS HAVE BEEN PUSHED TOGETHER AND WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME TO THAT AND GO THROUGH THIS. I'M HESITANT TO SOMETIME FOR LIKE A LET ME LET ME SO THAT'S I MEAN THAT'S JUST WHERE I'M SURE LET ME LET ME ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF THIS WORKGROUP THAT. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT- IN IDEA THAT WAS IN A PRESS RELEASE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN JANUARY. AT THAT TIME CHIEF JUSTICE PROMISED TO APPOINT ITS MEMBERS- IN THE COMING WEEKS- NEARLY FOUR MONTHS LATER. INCLUDING A SUBSTANTIAL PERIOD BEFORE THE SOAK SHELTON. ORDERS THERE STILL NOT ONE MEMBER SELECTED FOR THAT GROUP- OF PEOPLE FOR THERE HAS BEEN NO INDICATION WHAT AUTHORITY ANY THE GROUP WOULD. GIVEN EVEN TO RECOMMEND. CHANGES OF WHAT TIME FRAME WOULD BE POLL WELL. INSTEAD BE THE- NOT TO MENTION WE GOT THE WORK. PERSONS WANTED THERE'S NO TIME LINE THERE'S NO DISCUSSION OF WHAT A FORTY MAY HAVE BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE HER MUSING I GUESS THE DISCUSSION OF THE FACT THAT THE FLAWS THAT EXIST IN THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE FLAWS HAS TO DO WITH THIS WHOLE. A JURY SELECT. YOU DON'T HAVE SHE DOES NOT HAVE A COMMITTEE FORMED YEAH TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND- SO RATHER THAN JUST SITTING AROUND WAITING WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND TO RESPOND IN A WAY THAT HOPEFULLY WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA- SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS IT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO AFRICA CAN LEAD CITIZEN. A WITH REGARDS JURY AND OF DISSIPATION IN IN IN BEING SELECTED FOR JURY THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING EQUAL PROTECTION AND SURELY HAVING ACCESS TO OF JURIES THAT ARE OF THEIR PEERS IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE FACT THAT THE BASS PERSONS. AMERICAN. YEAH HELLO BILLION QUESTIONS. LIVE RESEARCHERS THANK YOU ARE WANNA MAKE A COUPLE COMMON FIRST OF ALL SHE% YOU BRING FOR THIS AND TOP IN BY WAY BACKGROUND WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL I HAVE WORKED AS A RESEARCH ASSISTANT FOR AN AFRICAN AMERICAN LAW PROFESSOR WHO WAS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S LEADING FROM DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AT THE TIME IN THE MID NINETIES WE LOOKED AT THE BATSON DECISION WHEELER DECISION AS MODELS WHAT WE DO TO PROTECT IN THIS SITUATION SO YEARS LATER ON SEE WE'RE HERE REVISITING THIS WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE. MY NAME IS THE BILL TODAY BUT I WANNA MAKE CLEAR THAT I AM. HOPING THAT WE'RE GONNA GET A LITTLE BIT MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ON THIS POTENTIALLY FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ON THIS AND I WOULD ALSO LOVE. SEE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND DATA AROUND CALIFORNIA. AND IF YOU HAVE THAT I WOULD LOVE TO LIST TO SEE THAT- AS A FORMER FROM. A COUPLE THINGS I WILL SAY. ONE I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT BOTH SIDES WOULD- COULD USE A COULD CHRISTMAS JEFF OUT OF THE CAR STE- PROSECUTORS COULD. ON THE FLIP SIDE I'M CERTAINLY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY GOOD FRIENDS WHO ARE CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS. SCENE PRINTER YOU JUST USED IN EXACTLY THE WAY THAT WE WANT BUT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AND I THINK. THAT HAS AN IMPACT. THE THING I WILL SAY THOUGH IS. IT IS ALL ABOUT INTENT AND AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ASKED THE QUESTION OF JURY POOLS. HAS ANYONE IN THIS ROOM HAD. OF EXPERTISE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO A PARTICULAR SITUATION. I WOULD SUBMIT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A DISCO TEN IN ASKING THE QUESTION. THE REASON I WOULD ASK A QUESTION WOULD BE TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER. JURORS WOULD BE ABLE TO BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. CONSIDERABLE ALL OF THE FACTS IN MAKING DECISION BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.AND I I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASK THAT QUESTION IN A WAY. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE HAD NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TEND TO BE OF CERTAIN RACIAL OR ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AND THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION BUT THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THERE'S NOT A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP HOW DO YOU TEACH THOSE ISSUES MEANT THAT YOU CAN STOP ESOS QUESTIONS BUT- UNDER. PART OF WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE SO THIS IS REALLY MORE COMMENTS- AS OPPOSED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION BUT- BUT YOU KNOW LOVE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO WILL. BE THINKING ABOUT THIS WITH BOTH THE WE HAVE TURNED. I DO THINK IT'S A DECISION THAT SHE CONTINUED ON LOAN SUPPORT TODAY BUT- HOPEFULLY WE HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO TALK MORE ABOUT NEGLECT. WELL I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING IS THAT YOU ASKED EVERYONE THE SAME QUESTION. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I WOULD ASK THAT QUESTION TO EVERY TEACHER. DOESN'T SAY YES AND I'VE BEEN. I'VE BEEN THE ONLY ONE ASKED THAT QUESTION. MISSION AND MAYBE THAT WAS THE CASE. IN YOUR COURTROOM BUT THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT. I'M NOT I DON'T THINK EVERY COURTROOMS THE SAME. TO YOU. RECORD HAVING A BIT. OF A INVOLVED IN THAT BUT- BUT THERE ARE. THERE ARE CASES. YOU DON'T. ASK QUESTIONS. NOT YES I WOULD. JUST I WOULD. PAY AND THE AND THE PROBLEM WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH. WITH THE- KINDS OF. THINGS THAT. THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF THE- INTERACTION. JURIES WERE THEY WERE DEALING BUSINESS THINGS PEOPLE. JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF WHATEVER THOSE THINGS CALLED AND ASKED THAT QUESTION YEAH. SO I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK THE IDEA OF PUSHING EVERYONE TO BE CONSISTENT IN THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THEIR HOUSE AND NO ONE'S GETTING SINGLED OUT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT ONE. JUST I'M I'M JUST NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS THAT SITUATION BUT I'M WILLING YOU KNOW I DO THINK THE CONVERSATIONS IMPORTANT AND SHE CAN. HANDLE FOR TWO TO THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL QUESTIONS. RIGHT WITH THAT MS WILL BE MAKE CLOTHES YEAH I JUST SIMPLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO- WILSON TESTIFIED AND THOSE MADE COMMENTS CONCERNING AB THIRTY SEVENTY- THIS IS ALWAYS A DIFFICULT DISCUSSION BECAUSE OF JUST LIKE THE BILL IT'S THE DEALS WITH IN TECH IS KIND OF DIFFICULT TO. WRAP YOUR HAND AROUND AND UNDERSTAND WHAT INTENT IS AND SOMETIMES ONLY WAS MOST BLATANT FORM OF INTENT DO WE ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE THAT EXIST VERSUS THE FACT THAT IT MAY HAVE OTHER LAYERS OF AND THAT'S THERE AND SO- BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT EVERYONE HAS PROBABLY RECOGNIZES THAT THERE'S CURRENT. THAT EXISTED OBVIOUSLY UNFAIR AND- AND HAS ME BIASES IN IT AND- ALLOW THE TO. I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED POOL THAT IS REFLECTIVE OF THIS. OF CALIFORNIA AND REFLECTIVE OF THE PERSON TO BE TRIED AND THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OF GETTING TO THAT POINT IS NOT AN EASY TASK TO DO WITH WHERE WE COULD MAGICALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN. AS ALL OF OUR BIASES THAT. THIS COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S DEALING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT IS HE HELPED THE BIASES MEDICAL APPLIANCES YOU NAME IT WE HAVE IT BECAUSE IT'S BUILT INTO OUR SYSTEM.

THAT'S OUT THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE OKAY AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE IS THE TASK FORCE TO STUDY AND FELLOW REPARATION PROPOSALS FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE WOULD ESTABLISH A TASK FORCE WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THANKYOU A TASK FORCE TO STUDY DEVELOP REPARATION PROPOSAL FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS THE BILL WOULD BE TASK FORCE CONSISTS EIGHT APPOINTED MEMBER. THIS OF A HISTORICAL RECORD OF BLACK SLAVERY AND THEY'RE ALL. LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES FURTHER THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE TASK FORCE TO RECOMMEND AMONG OTHER THINGS THE APPROPRIATE MECHANISM FOR REDRESS AS IT PERTAINS TO CALIFORNIA'S ROLE IN THESE LEYVA BLACK PEOPLE AND THERE AND THEY'RE AFTER LIVES. IT ALSO REQUIRES THEM TO DISSEMINATE THAT INFORMATION IN AN EDUCATIONAL FORMAT SO CALIFORNIA CAN UNDERSTAND ITS RELATIONSHIP. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF PROVIDING A VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE BILL AND I HOPE SOMEBODY READ IT BECAUSE IT GIVES A REALLY GOOD HISTORICAL INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO HOW LONG THIS IS THE CONCEPT REPARATION HAS BEEN AND MANY OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE THINGS TAKING PLACE. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA STATE EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN EIGHT SLAVERY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE CALIFORNIA WAS A FIFTY STATE IN NAME ONLY MUNICIPAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES ACTIVELY SUPPORTED BLACKEST LET ME IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA'S. RIGHT SLAVE. SINCE THE BOND IT SO LONG AS THEY HEAD INTO STATE WITH AGAINST PROP PRIOR STATE IN EIGHTEEN. CALIFORNIA COURTROOM PROVIDED SANCTUARY TO THOSE WHO DARE TO ESCAPE THE BONDS OF SLAVERY IN CALIFORNIA IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO CALIFORNIA DOCTOR THEIR HARSH FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT EMPOWERING STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES TO FOR SELF AND EMANCIPATED PERSONS LIVING WITHIN THE STATE BACK INTO CHAINS OF ENSLAVEMENT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT ORDERED FUGITIVE SLAVES AS IN THE HISTORICAL QUE TO PARTY LEASE RETURN THERE IN SLAVERY IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA'S CONCEPT. TO THE END OF THE U. THE- CALIFORNIA CITY IN LAW. AUTHORITIES FORCED A CONTRACT LABOR SYSTEM ALONG SLAVEHOLDERS TO EFFECTIVELY HOLES PERSONS AND BONDED TO BITE AND ANOTHER NAME. IN OTHER WORDS CALIFORNIA STATE COUNTY AND CITY AUTHORITIES ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE INSTITUTION OF BLACK SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN AND BEYOND CALIFORNIA. THIS IS TRUE IS NOT PART OF OUR STATE LARA CALIFORNIA CURRICULA BUT OFFICE CONCRETE EXAMPLES CALIFORNIA'S COMPLICITY IN RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. IN FACT THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES OF THE PAST ECHOES IN THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF TODAY'S BLACK CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT NEWSOME'S TWENTY TWENTY STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS BLACK PEOPLE MAKE UP 8% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION HOWEVER 43% OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA OR BLACK PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES ACCOUNT 420% OF THE STATE'S MALE PRISON POPULATION IS AFFECTED ME IN MAKE UP. FIVE SIX AND OF THE STATE ADULT. A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS THAT I NEARLY EVERY STATE. LET K. TWELVE DO HAVE A WAS PERFORMANCE OF RACE ETHNIC GROUP. EVEN AS WE DEBATE MS OF THE DEBATE THE NEED FOR THE STUDY. COLBERT NINETEEN SO BRING LIGHT ON THE CULMINATION OF THESE PERSISTENT DISPARITIES EMERGING DATA CONFIRMS THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF ILLNESS AND DEATH DUE TO CALL BUT NINETEEN FALL ON THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AND SOME THE AGE OF ENSLAVEMENT BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION BIRTH A LEGACY OF RACIAL HARM IN IT IN IN EQUITY THAT CONTINUES TO ACT THE CONDITIONS OF BLACK LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. WHO SUFFER INJURIES AND LOSSES THROUGH THE MALICIOUS AND CULPABILITY NEGLIGENT CONDUCT OF OTHERS HAVE A RIGHT TO REDRESS. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE AN IN DEPTH EXAMINATION THE IMPACTS OF SLAVERY AND ITS AFTER LIVES IN CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP- BADLANDS ONE HOW TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES BORN. OF A SHAMEFUL HISTORY. AS OUTLINED THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE A POSITION ON THE FORM THAT REPARATIONS WOULD TAKE. WHAT DOES TAKE A CLEAR POSITION REPETITIONS AS NOW THERE TO ADDRESS THE PERSISTENT EFFECT OF SLAVERY AND THE SIX. INCLUDE JACK WELCH. RED THAT THE BLADE. WELL CAPITAL IN CARSON.
