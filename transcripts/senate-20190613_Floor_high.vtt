00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:02.441
MOST OF THE VOTES ARE BI

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:05.711
PARTISAN.

00:19:05.777 --> 00:19:06.879
IN THE DEBATE THE DISCUSSIONS

ARE ALL RESPECTFUL AMICABLE.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:11.083

ALSO.

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.620
AND WE NOW ARE APPROACHING

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:14.920
[inaudible]

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:18.190
THE RESOLUTION.

THERE'S MUCH GOOD IN THIS BUDGET.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.627
THE YEAR BEGAN WITH A VERY

00:19:21.693 --> 00:19:22.794
HEALTHY [inaudible]

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:25.063
SURPLUS.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.900
A RARITY IN CALIFORNIA.

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:29.902
THE PRODUCT OF PRUDENCE.

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:32.004
BUT THE FORMER LEGISLATURE'S IN.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.740
THE FORMER GOVERNOR.

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:35.974
THAT WAS ALLOWING US

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:37.309
[inaudible] TO ACCRUE

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:37.609
[inaudible]

00:19:37.676 --> 00:19:39.711
THAT SURPLUS.

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.580
ASSISTED ALSO BUY SOMETHING THE

00:19:41.647 --> 00:19:44.116
VOTERS DID.

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:45.284
PROPOSITION TWO THE RAINY DAY

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.486
FUND.

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.888
WHICH INSURES HELP.

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.758
AND ABOUT FOR FOR THE FUTURE.

00:19:52.824 --> 00:19:55.494
THE GOOD IN THIS BUDGET IS.

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.062
A CONTINUING AND A STANDARD

00:19:57.129 --> 00:20:02.301
ATTEMPT. TO DEBT RETIRE.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.468
MORE MONEY HAS BEEN PUT FORTH

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:05.437
FOR THOSE PURPOSES [inaudible]

00:20:05.504 --> 00:20:07.539
LONG NEEDED.

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.974
AND IT SHOWS THAT WE ARE SEATED

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.709
SPIRITUALLY ADDRESSING

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:11.009
[inaudible]

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:14.212
THOSE CONCERNS.

00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:16.315
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THERE ARE

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:17.816
RAISING OF TAXES.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.919
INCLUDED IN THIS.

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:22.721
AND THE BIGGEST DEFICIENCY.

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.289
IS THE PRECARIOUSNESS AS WE

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:27.759
APPROACH THE FUTURE.

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.128
DURING A PRIOR ADMINISTRATION.

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.764
WE HAD A TEMPORARY BUDGET

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:33.832
SURPLUS I BELIEVE WAS FIFTEEN

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:36.501
BILLION.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:40.505
THAT ALL GOT SPENT IN MORE.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:43.542
AND EVEN REPUBLICANS CONTRIBUTED.

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:44.309
TO THE DOWNFALL OF THAT

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.111
PARTICULAR [inaudible]

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:49.448
YEARS SPENDING.

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:50.616
WELL ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ECONOMY

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:53.518
SO OFTEN [inaudible]

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:55.887
BLOCK.

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.756
WE WERE FIFTEEN BILLION AND THEN

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.191
LATER FORTY FIVE BILLION IN THE

00:20:59.257 --> 00:21:00.692
RED.

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:03.028
A HUGE HOLE [inaudible] TO

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:04.363
ENCOUNTER.

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.998
AND TO YET AGAIN.

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:09.635
CRAWL OUT OF AND THE SOLUTION

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.103
CANNOT ALWAYS BE.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.705
JUST RAISE TAXES.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:16.141
IN FACT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.043
THIS BUDGET AS WITH OTHERS

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.343
[inaudible]

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.345
TROUBLED AGENCIES [inaudible]

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:21.880
LIKE DMV [inaudible]

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.682
AND ARE.

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:26.385
I TT PROJECTS WHICH ALWAYS RUN

00:21:26.451 --> 00:21:28.420
BILLIONS OVER COST.

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:29.955
AND NEVER EVEN CLOSE TO BEING ON

00:21:30.022 --> 00:21:30.822
TIME AND USUALLY STILL DON'T

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:33.759
WORK.

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:34.993
WELL WE ARE REWARDING THEM WITH

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.563
MORE MONEY.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.298
ANOTHER AGENCY THAT WAS SUPPOSED

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:42.234
TO GET GUNS AWAY FROM

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:42.534
[inaudible]

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:44.803
DANGEROUS FELONS.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.372
HAD BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF MONEY.

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:50.108
AND NOTHING HAPPENED.

00:21:50.175 --> 00:21:51.877
AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.545
BUDGET TO SEE SOME OF THAT

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:54.880
AUTHORITY NOW.

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.215
RIGHTEOUSLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:58.650
WE HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:02.087
DO THE JOB BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY.

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:02.988
SO THE ANSWER ALWAYS ISN'T

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:04.423
SIMPLY[inaudible]

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:07.426
MORE MONEY.

00:22:07.492 --> 00:22:10.696
BUT TO I FUNDAMENTAL POINT.

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:11.930
I DO NOT CLAIM TO BE AN

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:17.903
ECONOMIST I STUDY ECONOMY A LOT.

00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:19.738
BUT I DO BELIEVE AND HAVE SAID

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:21.139
FOR YEARS ARE VERY BUDGET IS

00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:22.074
PRECARIOUSLY [inaudible]

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.077
BALANCE [inaudible]

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:26.812
IN ANOTHER.

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:27.446
RECESSION.

00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.448
OF ANY SORT.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.349
NOT EVEN ONE AS SEVERE AS THE

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:32.217
ONE WE EXPERIENCED A FEW YEARS

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:34.052
BACK.

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:34.953
AND WE'RE GONNA QUICKLY BE

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.855
UPSIDE DOWN SO THE CAUTION THAT

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:38.490
I PREACHED ALL YEAR IN THIS

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:41.493
BUDGET THE LIBERATION

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:41.793
[inaudible]

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.462
USE CARE [inaudible]

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:44.996
CON CUIDADO [inaudible]

00:22:45.063 --> 00:22:47.232
USE CARE.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.233
AND BE PRUDENT CONTINUE TO BE

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.001
PRUDENT.

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:51.870
AND DON'T GET ENTHUSED ABOUT

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:55.107
BASS BUILDINGS SPENDING.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:56.508
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT

00:22:56.575 --> 00:22:58.810
DEFICIENCIES IN THE BILL.

00:22:58.877 --> 00:22:59.945
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:02.047
OF DOLLARS.

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:04.816
A BASE BUILDING OBLIGATIONS.

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.818
CONTAINED IN THIS BUDGET.

00:23:06.885 --> 00:23:08.653
THAT I FEAR.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.590
BUT TO GET US IN TROUBLE.

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:13.592
ANOTHER AS AN ASIDE PHENOMENA

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:14.860
THAT I'M STARTING TO SEE MORE

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:17.662
REGULARLY AND BILLS AROUND HERE

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:19.931
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

00:23:19.998 --> 00:23:21.333
BILLS IT SHOULD HAVE

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:23.301
APPROPRIATIONS IN THEM

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:23.602
[inaudible]

00:23:23.668 --> 00:23:25.403
OUR PASSING [inaudible]

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.206
POLICY BILLS.

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:30.942
THE CREATE FISCAL OBLIGATIONS

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:31.243
[inaudible]

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:34.112
BUT THE LANGUAGE STATES THAT

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:35.180
THIS WILL BE FUNDED IN FUTURE

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:37.549
BUDGETS.

00:23:37.616 --> 00:23:40.619
OBLIGING FUTURE LEGISLATORS NOW

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.854
WHY WOULD THAT BE A PROBLEM.

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.023
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOT CREATED A

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.360
CONSTITUENCY IN AN EXPECTATION.

00:23:48.426 --> 00:23:50.462
OF SOME BODY OR SOME ENTITY OR

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.164
SOME PROGRAM.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.764
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET SOME

00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:55.967
MONEY.

00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:57.469
AND IF THEY DON'T THEN THAT

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.337
FUTURE BUDGET.

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:01.106
THERE WILL BE.

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:04.209
DIFFICULTIES OF COURSE.

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.279
AND THIS BUDGET DOES INDEED.

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:09.447
BUILD FUTURE OBLIGATIONS.

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:10.515
BUT I BELIEVE ARE OF GREAT

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:13.018
CONCERN.

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:15.921
ENHANCE MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:18.890
VOTE NO ON THE BUDGET. FOR THAT

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.792
REASON LOOKING FORWARD.

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:21.526
AND ONE OF THE GREAT

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:23.562
DEFICIENCIES OF OUR INSTITUTIONS

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:26.965
TODAY AND THIS ONE IS.

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:27.532
ONE WE'RE KIND OF ME NOW MAY

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.467
FIRST.

00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:31.336
AND WE DON'T LOOK TO THE FUTURE.

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:32.437
WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FIVE YEARS

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:34.239
FROM NOW?

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:36.041
NOT THIS YEAR AND THEN THE OFF

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.242
YOUR BUDGET BUT WHAT WILL IT

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:38.476
MEAN FIVE YEARS FROM NOW AND

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:40.178
THIS IS MY CONCERN.

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:41.746
AND THAT'S WHY AS FAR AS THIS

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:42.848
BUDGET IS CONCERNED.

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:45.050
I WILL BE A NO VOTE.

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:46.218
AS WE DELIBERATE ON THE TRAILER

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:47.352
BILLS.

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.887
I BELIEVE SOME OF THOSE SO WILL

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:50.455

A HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND PRICES

WHICH IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.628

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.829
CONCERN.

00:27:44.896 --> 00:27:46.331

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:48.199
BEEN INCREASING.

00:27:48.266 --> 00:27:49.667
AT A DECREASING RATE WHICH MEANS

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:52.270
WE HOPE WE SHOULD BE AT THE TOP

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:53.838
OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET BUT

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:54.706

AS AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE.

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:04.682
WHICH FOR THE LAST SIXTY YEARS

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:06.384
HAS BEEN A VERY RELIABLE

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.086
INDICATOR OF AN UPCOMING

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.821
RECESSION WHETHER IT'S SIX

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.790

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:33.812
IT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE

00:28:33.878 --> 00:28:35.547
REASONS WHY IT TOOK UNTIL LAST

00:28:35.613 --> 00:28:37.515

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:14.586
WHOLE.

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:16.921
SO IT IS GOOD TO SEE THAT THIS

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.756
BUDGET STARTS THE PROP NINETY

EIGHTEEN CAPPERS.

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.201
AND SO WHAT NEWS WE'VE GOTTEN SO

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:04.969
FAR.

00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:07.238

00:30:11.843 --> 00:30:14.012
BUT THE CAPPERS WE ARE SEEING.

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:16.681

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:18.550
EVEN WITH A STRONG ECONOMY OUR

00:30:18.616 --> 00:30:19.817

WILDFIRE CONFLAGRATIONS.

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:53.785
THE BIG QUESTION IS WHERE WHERE

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.019
DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM

00:30:55.086 --> 00:30:57.655

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:27.805
OF THE INTERESTING THINGS IS

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.240
THAT THE BUDGET DOLES OUT ABOUT

00:33:29.307 --> 00:33:30.608

HAVE TO CUT COSTS THAT'S USUALLY

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:52.930
WHERE YOU ATTACK FIRST.

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.699
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A RATHER

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:55.767
UNFORTUNATE.

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:58.169
INDICTMENT OF THE BUDGET.

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:01.539

WE WILL BE JUDGED HOWEVER FOR

00:34:03.107 --> 00:34:05.376
STEPPING OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF

THE PART THAT I FIND

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.976
DISAPPOINTING IS THIS BUDGET

CAN'T AND REMOVING THAT WALLET

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:57.714

RESEARCH THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

00:52:03.286 --> 00:52:04.454
AND I WANT TO GIVE THE CREDIT

00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:06.756
FOR THOSE RESERVES.

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.024
PRIMARILY TO THE CITIZENS OF THE

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:10.494
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.430

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:18.502
MAN'S FROM NOW.

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.337
BEFORE SOMETIMES WE DO.

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:22.405
THE RIGHT THING -- PROP.

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.673

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.309
DOLLARS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:26.810
BECAUSE DURING THE GREAT

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.278
RECESSION.

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:29.613
WE WITNESS AT THE STATE CAN

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:31.748
QUICKLY BE UPSIDE DOWN TO THE

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:33.683
TUNE OF FORTY BILLION DOLLARS.

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:35.318
IF WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC

00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:35.619

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.821
DOWNTURN.

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:40.357
AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:42.626
WHEN THE NEXT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN?

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.527
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO THOSE

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:45.328
RESERVES.

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.830
ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:47.430
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:51.001
THE FRAGILITY IF YOU WILL.

00:52:51.067 --> 00:52:55.171
OF OUR GENERAL FUND. 1% OF THE

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:56.940
POPULATION MAKES A 50% OF OUR

00:52:57.007 --> 00:53:00.043
GENERAL FUND.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:00.677
MEANING THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:03.113
CAREFUL.

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:06.816
ABOUT DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE.

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:09.686
AND PEOPLE THAT WE LEON.

00:53:09.753 --> 00:53:17.027
IN THE NAME OF INCOME INEQUALITY.

00:53:17.093 --> 00:53:18.261
WE HAVE AN OPIATE ADDICTION

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:19.429
PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:20.096

ADDRESS AND WE ALSO HAVE.

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:24.401

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:33.610

00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:49.859
I AM ALSO STILL CONCERNED ABOUT

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:54.530
THE THE DELIVERANCE OF SERVICES

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:57.333
TO UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.201
THAT'S GOING TO COST THE

00:58:58.268 --> 00:59:00.103
TAXPAYERS NINETY EIGHT MILLION

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:02.138
DOLLARS IN THE FISCAL YEAR.

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:03.506
BUT I I DO BELIEVE THAT THE

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:04.407
INTENT OF THE PROPOSAL IS PRAISE

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:06.309
WORTHY.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.111
WE SHOULD BE PHILANTHROPIC AND

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:08.678
WE SHOULD BE ALLOCATING THE

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:10.280
FUNDS.

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:11.414
AND GIVING THE SERVICES TO

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:12.382
UNDERPRIVILEGED AND LOW INCOME

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:13.549
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN THE

00:59:13.616 --> 00:59:15.618
STATE.

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.086
BUT IT SHOULD NOT DELUDE OUR

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:18.421
ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THE LESS

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:20.390
FORTUNATE CITIZENS WHO LEGALLY

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:23.026
CALL CALIFORNIA THEIR HOME.

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.027
YOU SEE WE HAVE A SYSTEM MEDI

00:59:24.093 --> 00:59:26.496
CAL.

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:27.730
THAT IS BASICALLY AN INSURANCE

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:30.333
IN NAME ONLY.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.467
WE'RE BASICALLY SELLING PEOPLE A

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:33.169
CAR.

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:36.039
WITHOUT AN ENGINE.

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:37.407
BECAUSE ONE THING THAT THIS

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:38.841
LEGISLATURE FAILS TO DO YEAR

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.810
AFTER YEAR.

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:43.680
AND THAT IS A FULL RESTORATION.

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.048
OF THE FEES THAT WE PAY

00:59:45.114 --> 00:59:46.516
PHYSICIANS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR

00:59:46.582 --> 00:59:48.084
CITIZENS [inaudible]

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:50.353
RIGHT NOW.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.221
THE MEDICAL THREE APPROXIMATE

00:59:52.288 --> 00:59:55.792
45% 50% OF THE MEDICARE FEE.

00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.760
HENCE MOST DOCTORS ESPECIALLY IN

00:59:57.827 --> 01:00:00.430
RURAL AREAS THAT I REPRESENT.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:04.167
REFUSED TO TAKE IT.

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.668
SO WE'RE GIVING A FALSE SENSE OF

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:07.670
SECURITY TO PEOPLE.

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:08.838
THE THINK THEY CAN GET.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.773
HEALTHCARE.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.674
BUT WE'RE REALLY EXACERBATING A

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:13.409
SYSTEM.

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:14.277
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.411
RECORDING MORE DOCTORS BUT

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.579
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADDING MORE

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:17.814
POPULATION WHICH MEANS THOSE

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.015
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN TRYING

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:19.615
HARD TO SEE A DOCTOR THAT ARE

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:20.850
LOOK.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.218
LEGAL CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF

01:00:22.285 --> 01:00:23.553
CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO BE

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.655
FURTHER PUSHED OUT.

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:26.889
AND WE'RE STILL GOING TO SEE THE

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.591
END AND THE THE THE DEMAND IF

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:31.361
YOU WILL.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:32.528
OF SERVICES IN THE EMERGENCY

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.563
ROOM WHICH WE NO COST SO MUCH

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:38.067
MORE MONEY.

01:00:38.134 --> 01:00:39.569
WE HAVE 25% OF THE HOMELESS

01:00:39.635 --> 01:00:40.336
POPULATION IN THE STATE OF

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:42.005
CALIFORNIA.

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:44.574
OF THE ENTIRE NATION.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.608
AND WHAT'S EQUALLY.

01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:48.611
APPALLING TO ME.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.848
IT IS A TEN THOUSAND EIGHT

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:52.415
HUNDRED THIRTY SIX OF THOSE

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:53.149
HOMELESS ARE VETERANS THESE ARE

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:55.218
PEOPLE THAT.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:57.720
PUT IT ALL ON THE LINE FOR US.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:58.755
WROTE A BLANK CHECK INCLUDING

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.456
THEIR LIFE.

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:01.624
SO THAT WE COULD STAND HERE ON

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.292
THE FLOOR.

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:05.028
AND HAVE THIS ABILITY TO HAVE

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:06.496
FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND DEBATE.

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:09.499
OF THIS BUDGET.

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:10.600
IF WE TOOK THAT NINETY EIGHT

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:13.202
MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERTISE IT

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.204
TO THE TEN THOUSAND EIGHT

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:15.772
HUNDRED THIRTY SIX HOMELESS

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:16.773
VETERANS.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.876
WE COULD PUT.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:22.011
A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS.

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.446
AND STILL HAVE FIFTY TWO MILLION

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:27.817
DOLLARS TO SPARE.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.118
BUT WE ALL KNOW MY FRIENDS OF

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.553
MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES THAT

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.788
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH TO OVER

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:35.258
AROUND YES EVEN IN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.826
AND I HAVE TO ASK WHY ARE WE

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:37.927
FEELING SO MANY CALIFORNIA

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.329
CITIZENS.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:42.932
RENTS ARE RISING.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.568
UTILITIES ARE GOING UP.

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.303
WE TALKED ABOUT THE GAS PRICES

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.905
GOING UP FIVE POINT SIX CENTS

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:58.514
THIS YEAR THIS JULY WHY FIRST OF

01:01:58.581 --> 01:01:59.048
TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA'S

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:00.550
AGRICULTURAL AGRICULTURE FEEDS

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:02.885
THE WORLD.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.854
GET EVERY DAY ONE IN FIVE

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:05.688
CHILDREN GO TO BED HUNGRY

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:05.988
[inaudible]

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:07.857
IT'S JUST [inaudible]

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:16.699
IRONIC.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.868
ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND AND

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.169
EIGHTEEN STUDY PERFORMED BY THE

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.704
BERKATA CENTER AT GEORGE MASON

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.339
UNIVERSITY.

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:24.807
CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

01:02:24.874 --> 01:02:27.009
RANKS FORTIETH.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.212
AT A FIFTY IS FIFTY STATES

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:29.512
[inaudible]

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.214
EXAMPLE FINE.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.316
BEFORE WE EXPAND SERVICES OF OUR

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.517
MEDICAL PROGRAM.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:38.488
WE NEED TO FIX IT.

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:42.859
SO WHY COLLEAGUES.

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.861
HEALTH CARE ACCESSIBILITY IS

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:45.962
MORE THAN JUST BEING INSURED

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.930
HEALTH INSURANCE CAN BE RENDERED

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.999
UNLESS THE PATIENT CAN'T FIND A

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.267
HOSPITAL OR DOCTORS WILLING TO

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.235
SEE THEM.

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:53.669
AND AGAIN THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:57.473
HAPPENING IN THE STATE.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.475
DR TED MAZER AND YOUR NOSE AND

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.110
THROAT SURGEON ANY PREVIOUS

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.512
PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.147
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION EXPLAIN THE

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.515
BEST.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.616
THE PROBLEM WITH LOW

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.784
REIMBURSEMENT ISN'T THAT DOCTORS

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.986
AREN'T MAKING MONEY.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.020
IT'S AT THE DOCTORS AND

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:12.488
HOSPITALS ARE PAYING OUT OF

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.290
POCKET TO GIVE CARE. TO MEDI CAL

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.592
BENEFICIARIES THERE'S A LIMIT TO

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:17.960
WHAT YOU CAN DO AND THE PRIVATE

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:20.429
PRACTICE WORLD. TO KEEP THE

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:23.332
DOORS OPEN.

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:25.168
I WANT TO PLUG THOSE POSITIONS

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.769
TO DO THE PHILANTHROPIC CARE

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:29.272
TAKE CARE OF ARE LESS FORTUNATE

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:32.608
CITIZENS.

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.943
DID YOU KNOW THAT AN AVERAGE OF

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.545
TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN

01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.345
EACH YEAR ENROLLED IN THE

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.080
MEDICARE PROGRAM DO NOT RECEIVE

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:42.084
THE REQUIRED PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:42.985
LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:45.555
IMMUNIZATIONS LEAD POISONING

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:46.422
ASSESSMENTS.

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.158
AND OPTOMETRY.

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.426
THIS WAS FOUND BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.296
STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT.

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.964
THAT MEANS THAT A CLOSE TO A

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:55.998
QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.533
NOT.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.801
ACCEPTING THE PREVENTATIVE

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.770
SERVICES EVEN THOUGH.

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.939
THEY DO HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.373
THE OUR REPORT CITED MANY

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.875
REASONS FOR THIS PROBLEM ONE

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:06.876
BEING.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:07.577
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:09.245
SERVICES IS A LOT MEDI CAL PLANS

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:11.047
TO SKIRT.

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.949
MANDATORY TRAVEL RULES THIS

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.550
MEANS THAT MANY FAMILIES ON MEDI

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.219
CAL TYPICALLY LOW INCOME.

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:17.286
WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.121
MILES OR SEVERAL HOURS TO GET TO

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.790
A DOCTOR.

01:04:20.856 --> 01:04:21.591
AND THESE FAMILIES JUST DON'T

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.426
HAVE THE ABILITY OR CAPACITY TO

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:24.627
DO THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS TRUE

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.062
IN MY DISTRICT.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.664
WHERE IT'S TWO HOURS FROM PALM

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.666
DESERT TO BLIGHT?

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:31.601
IN THE EXPANSIVE COUNTY THAT I

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:34.470
REPRESENT.

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.438
THAT'S AGAIN CHILDREN ARE

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:36.806
GETTING THE ACCESS THEY NEED IS

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.007
EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN THE

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.875
MEDICAL PROGRAM.

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:40.977
ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT THE AUDIT

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:42.678
FOUND WAS A MEDI CAL WAS FILLING

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:43.879
TO ENSURE PLANS THAT MEET THE

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:45.414
CULTURAL LINGUISTIC NEEDS OF

01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.449
CALIFORNIA'S.

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:47.984
DIVERSE POPULATION AS WELL AS

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.253
LOW PROVIDER REIMBURSE RIVERS

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:53.589
FROM RATES CONTINUE.

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.258
CALIFORNIA'S LAWMAKERS AND MADE

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:56.259
IT A PRIORITY TO DRIVE DOWN THE

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.994
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.695
UNINSURED BUT AMAZINGLY WE HAVE

01:04:59.762 --> 01:05:01.197
ONE OF THE LOWEST INSURED RATES

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.367
IN THE NATION AT ABOUT 7% NOW.

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.202
AND WE HAVE THIRTY NINE POINT

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:08.037
FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS --

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.740
COVERED.

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:12.375
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:13.776
BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.544
UNDERMINE OUR GOAL OF EXPANDING

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.647
ACCESS TO CARE BY FAILING TO

01:05:17.713 --> 01:05:18.447
REIMBURSE DOCTORS A LIVABLE

01:05:18.514 --> 01:05:20.650
RATES.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:26.255
SOME OF MY FRIENDS.

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:28.257
I TALK ABOUT WHY WE ARE RAISING

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:30.259
TAXES A FEW BILLION DOLLARS SO

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:33.329
WE HAVE THESE BUDGET SURPLUSES.

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:34.463
STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE A

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:35.598
DEDUCTION COMES OFF OF ALL OF

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:37.900
OUR PAYCHECKS.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.068
WE'RE GONNA DRAWDOWN RESERVES

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:41.070
AND THEN ALL OF OUR CITIZENS

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.705
THAT WORK AND HAVE.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.473
PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS WILL SEE

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:45.741
ANOTHER TEMP OR TWO TENTHS OF A

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:47.310
PERCENT.

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:50.146
TAKEN OUT OF THEIR PAYCHECKS.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.714
WE HAVE A CELL PHONE TAX SO WE

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:52.915
COULD VERY EASILY A FUNDED

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:54.517
THROUGH OUR BUDGET SURPLUSES A

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:55.084
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.919
DOLLARS VITALLY IMPORTANT

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.754
SOMETHING WE LEARNED DURING THE

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.423
THE FIRES OF OF LAST YEAR.

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.557
SOMETHING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.326
HAS ALREADY DONE.

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:05.127
WE INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNICATION

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:07.029
SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE A REVERSE

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:07.930
NINE ONE ONE WE CAN COMMUNICATE

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.432
WITH ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:11.233
JURISDICTION FROM ANY PART OF

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.401
THE STATE OR COUNTRY.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.169
THAT COMES INTO OUR

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:14.603
JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE NEEDS

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:16.706
TO DO THIS.

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:18.140
BUT WE DON'T NEED TO RAISE THE

01:06:18.207 --> 01:06:20.042
TAX ON ALL THE CELL PHONES THE

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.711
NUMBERS.

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:22.578
THAT AGAIN HAS A REGRESSIVE

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.847
IMPACT.

01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:28.117
ON THE POOREST OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:28.918
AND THAT WE TALK ABOUT WE'RE

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:29.919
GONNA BE FIGHTING AFFORDABLE

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.520
HEALTH CARE TO CITIZENS IN THE

01:06:31.587 --> 01:06:33.155

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:37.660
PARTICULAR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:40.963
BUT WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.198
IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO REQUIRE

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:42.498
[inaudible]

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.367
THE LOWER [inaudible]

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.902
INCOME FOLKS.

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.437
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE INSURANCE

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:51.340
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:53.309
CAN NOW PAY THE STATE MANDATE OF

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.244
SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:57.179
SO THEY CAN CONTINUE NOT TO BE

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.447
ABLE TO AFFORD INSURANCE SO THAT

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.449
WE CAN PROVIDE.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.317
MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE TO MAKE UP

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:01.784

HEALTHCARE.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:13.796
WHICH I THINK IS COMPLETELY

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:18.434
WRONG.

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:20.970
AND THEN PROMISES THAT ARE MADE

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:21.804
SHOULD BE PROMISES THAT ARE

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.739

THE MEDICAL SYSTEM RAISING MEDI

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.451
CAL FEES.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.019
BUT WE HAVE SUSPENSIONS AT THIS

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:38.587
GOVERNOR IS GOING TO USE TO

01:07:38.654 --> 01:07:41.624
RETAKE TO RATE THE FUND. FOR

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.594
GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY PURPOSES.

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:48.097
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:48.664
TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT'S NOT

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.231

HIGHEST TAX TO THE SINS IN THE

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:12.087
COUNTRY WE HAD PROP THIRTY TAXES%

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:13.489
OPPOSED TO BE TEMPORARY THAT

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.190

WE NEED TO USE OUR MONEY WISELY.

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:31.307
WE DON'T NEED TO BE ADDING TAXES

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:32.608
WHEN IN FACT WE HAVE BUDGET

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:34.777

COST BEFORE KINDERGARTEN WERE

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.915
HIGH ENOUGH BUT THEN WHEN I HAD

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:43.759
THAT COST.

01:15:49.912 --> 01:15:51.146
FOCUSING.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.282
ON WHAT DEEPLY CONCERNS ME ABOUT

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.350
THE STRUCTURE.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.452
OF OUR CALIFORNIA FINANCES.

01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.222
AND THAT IS OUR EXTRAORDINARY

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:02.024
VOLATILITY WHICH HAS BEEN

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.326
EXPRESSED BY MANY OF THE

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:05.727
SPEECHES HERE TODAY ON THIS

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.462
FLOOR.

01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:09.498
AND THOSE THAT VOLATILITY IS NOT

01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:11.867
SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.402
BASED UPON THE COUNTLESS POINT

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.670
OF VIEW.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:16.605
BUT A VERY HUMAN POINT OF VIEW

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:18.507
ABOUT FURLOUGHS AND PROGRAM

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.776

WE CARE ABOUT.

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.013
AND SO I THINK ABOUT THE LONG

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.615
TERM.

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.116
ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:30.118
AND WHY RISE TODAY IS TO SAY

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:30.886
THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEW

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:34.523
REVENUES AND YES I KNOW WE CAN-IT TAKE HERE AND THERE BUT YOU

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:36.425

LEGISLATURE EITHER GOES TO A

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.169
RESERVE ACCOUNT OF WHICH THERE

01:16:47.235 --> 01:16:50.138

IN THE NEAR TERM IN THE EVENT

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.016
THERE SOME LEVEL OF DOWNTURN.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.084
BUT I THINK IT EVIDENCE IS A

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:04.286
LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY IN TERMS

01:17:04.353 --> 01:17:05.554

AND THIS BUDGET MOVES US FORWARD

01:19:56.658 --> 01:19:58.693
IN THAT EFFORT HOPEFULLY MUCH

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.061
MORE TO COME IN THE FUTURE.

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.397
AND AS MY JEWISH MOTHER USED TO

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:05.133
SAY THE GLASS MAY BE HALF EMPTY.

ADDITIONAL MONEY WE HAVE? TO

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:23.578
SUPPORT STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS.

ARE WHO FOR DECADES HAVE SEEN

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:26.414
SOME OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:29.084
MENTIONED -- WHAT A LUXURY WE

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:30.819
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO STAND HERE

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:32.354
AND ARGUE OVER CRITICALLY

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.655
IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT WERE

01:21:33.722 --> 01:21:35.290
TRYING?

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.859
TO ENHANCE OUR BRING BACK.

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:40.028
A TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:41.329
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THAT.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:42.864
THAT SUPPORT SO MANY THINGS THAT

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.199
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:46.401
MENTIONED I DON'T NEED TO TO

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:50.171
REPEAT -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS --

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:51.906
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE ONE I'M GONNA

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:55.243
TALK ABOUT WATER -- YOU KNOW

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.412
THIS BODIES VERY MINDFUL ABOUT

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.282
FEE INCREASES IN TAX INCREASES

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.916
IT'S WHY WE APPROACH THE WATER

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.785
ISSUE.

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:05.553
I IN THE WAY THAT WE DID.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.522
AND YOU DON'T LET ME JUST SAY

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.624
WHAT A LUXURY TO HAVE BOTTLED

01:22:09.691 --> 01:22:10.725
WATER.

01:22:10.792 --> 01:22:11.793
WHEN I GREW UP IN SOUTHWEST

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.194
VIRGINIA AND CARRIED WATER FROM

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:15.630
A SPRING WE DIDN'T HAVE BOTTLED

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.265
WATER TO EVEN BRING IN?

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.534
SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:22.704
WATER FROM A A RAIN BARREL AND

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:23.438
FROM A SPRING.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:26.041
AND TO COOK ON A WOOD STOVE AND

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:28.276
MAKE SURE YOU HEAT THE WATER FOR

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.945
WHATEVER PURPOSE FOR FOOD. TO

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:34.949
TAKE A BATH AND A TEN TUB -- YOU

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.985
KNOW I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:39.054
SO I'VE BEEN IN BOTH WORLDS I'VE

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.955
BEEN IN THE WORLD WITHOUT IT.

01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:42.524
AND I LIVE IN THE WORLD WITH IT.

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.758
AND THERE IS NOT ONE PERSON IN

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:45.894
CALIFORNIA THAT SHOULD LIVE THAT

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:46.961
WAY TODAY.

01:22:47.028 --> 01:22:49.798
NOT ONE AND SO THAT WE HAVE

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:51.766
FOUND A WAY TO DO THIS -- IT WAS

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:53.301
OUR INTENT TO USE GENERAL FUND

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:56.304
DOLLARS -- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:58.006
ARE WE MADE THE BEST OF A

01:22:58.073 --> 01:23:00.709
NEGOTIATION ACROSS -- THREE

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:03.244
PARTIES AND WE DID WHAT WE HAD

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.680
TO DO -- SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY IN

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:08.149
TERMS OF HOW IN ORDER TO GET IT

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.818
DONE AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUES

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.086
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WHO

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:13.088
STRETCHED. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.789
WAS AT STAKE IN MAKING THAT

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:17.425
DECISION THAT WAS IMPORTANT AND

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:20.662

A BUDGET FORWARD THAT WE HAVE

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:31.373
WORKED.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:35.677
YEARS TO GET TO THE POINT -- MY

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:37.712

FOR MANY I THINK SHE SAID.

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.629
FIVE WE HAVE THE BEST EXPERIENCE

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:55.830

SOMETHING WE ASPIRE TO AND IT

01:24:04.939 --> 01:24:06.975
CAME A BELT.

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:09.811
BECAUSE WE PUT FORWARD AN IDEA

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.179
OF A RAINY DAY FUND FROM THE

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.982

SO WE HAVE.

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:30.031

AND WE'RE PAYING DOWN DEBT.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.808
AND WE'RE PAYING DOWN PENSION

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.609
LIABILITY.

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:44.746
THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MY

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:45.880
COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT OF ME

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:47.215
HERE THE MAJORITY LEADER GAVE

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.650
THE PERCENTAGE.

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:51.653
WHAT A LUXURY THAT WE HAVE TO BE

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:54.189
ABLE TO PROMOTE FISCAL

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:55.523
RESPONSIBILITY?

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.926
IN OUR BUDGET.

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.394
BUT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:00.695
FEEL.

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.331
THE BENEFIT OF THE SURPLUS.

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:04.666
AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO TO

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.434
BALANCE THAT.

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.803
WAS TO PUT RESOURCES INTO

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:11.172
PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THEY ARE.

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:15.743
LOWER INCOME MIDDLE CLASS LIFE.

IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.882
THE WORLD WHERE WE HAVE MOST OF

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.484

PEOPLE.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:28.156
IF YOU THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:29.224

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:31.426
LIFETIME.

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.577
OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE WE

THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:10.899
WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.901
CRISIS A DECADE AGO BECAUSE WE

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:14.869

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:15.670
ALONG WITH THE LOBSTER WE

BETTER SOLUTIONS SHAME ON US AND
