MCCARTY MISTRAL COUNTY FAIR DOCTOR OVER HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO TODAY WERE VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE ON THE FRIDAY BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY DOESN'T QUITE FEEL LIKE MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MOST OF US HAVE PLANS AS WE NORMALLY WOULD BE ALL THE MORE OF A RUNNING AROUND TO RIDE THE EVENTS- BUT TODAY WE ARE HERE TO FOCUS ON A FEW PROPOSALS. REQUIRE IN THE ADMIN SHOULDN'T GIVE DISCRETION OVER FUTURE FISCAL DECISIONS AND WHILE WE ARE REITERATED FORTY ONE WE ARE. NOT BE OUR TWO MONTHS INTO NINE SORT OF LIKE I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE A- HEY BEFORE THE NINETEEN AFTER CO NINETEEN NOW IN THE AFTER COME NINETEEN. WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REFLECT HOW THE STATE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO FUNCTION- WHAT'S WORKED WELL IN WHAT HASN'T. AGAIN I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM FOR WORKING VERY VERY HARD TO FLATTEN THIS CURVE. TO GET A PEOPLE EDUCATED GET PEOPLE UPTO SPEED. THEY SURE THATWE HAD PROPER RESOURCES- HOSPITAL ROOMS VENTILATORS PP TO REMOTELY. MANAGE TO THIS PANDEMIC. BIT BUT HAVING SAID THAT I KNOW THAT. MYSELF AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES FEEL THAT THE LET WE WOULD LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE MORE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. WHEN WE WERE IN RECESS I KNOW LL OF US WERE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR COMMUNITY. TRYING TO GET INFORMATION AND WHILE WE KNOW IT WAS- EMERGENCY FLOWING AS QUICKLY AS WE WOULD LIKE. SO NOW THAT WE ARE INTO THIS PANDEMIC IN WELL IN TWO MONTHS. WE WANT TO RE EVALUATE THIS PROCESS- TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS WORKED. ABOUT WHAT HOW DOES IT WORK REALLY LOOK TO THE FUTURE ON WHAT THE PROCESS SHOULD LOOK LIKE NO KNOWING THAT THE PROCESS WAS NOT AS SMOOTH AS WE WOULD LIKE- THE LA HAS WRITTEN. HAS HAD A COUPLE CLOSE I JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT I THOUGHT REALLY SUMMARIZED I THINK OUR FEELINGS QUITE WELL- WHAT OTHER QUOTES FROM THEIR ANALYSIS OF THE MAY REVISION WAS WE ARE VERY TROUBLED BY THE DEGREE OF A FORTY. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS REQUESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DELEGATE. SO PARTICULAR I THINK WITH A COUPLE GOALS TO. SET UP A PROCESS OF MOVING FORWARD ONE ONE ENSURE THE GOVERNOR. HAS THE ABILITY TO DO HIS JOB AND TO REACT PROPERLY IN THIS COVE IT NINETEEN EMERGENCY. TWO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ONCE WE GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE OR IF WE GET FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT THERE IS A PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THOSE RESOURCES VERY QUICKLY. AND IMMEDIATELY- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT THIS PANDEMIC- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS PROCESS I CAN ONLY SPEAK. FOR MYSELF. QUITE OFTEN LIKE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I HAD TO WATCH THE GOVERNOR'S NOON PRESS CONFERENCE TO KEEP UP TO DATE WITH INFORMATION- THERE WEREN'T VERY MANY AVENUES OUTSIDE OF THAT TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- AND SO- WE NEED TO HAVE A MUCH BETTER PROCESS WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE. ON NOT JUST MYSELF INDIVIDUALLY BUT WITHIN. BODY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PART OF THIS A STATES PROCESS AS WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT THIS PANDEMIC. IN IN. LOT LAST I THINK WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT AND WE WILL BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF THE FEDERAL TRIGGER. I WAS CONCERNED THE STATE BAN ON APRIL TWENTIETH WE CAME BACK FOR THE FIRST TIME. ABOUT THE CONSTANT USE OF THE JAIL B. C. LETTERS. NOW THAT WE ARE HERE AND BACK IN SEC WE BELIEVE OUR I BOUGHT TO SEE I BELIEVE. THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE USING THOSE JAIL BC LETTERS FOR NEW APPROPRIATION. THAT WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS WE- DEMONSTRATED VERY QUICKLY THE DAY THAT WE RECESSED HOW FAST WE ACT. THE GOVERNOR FORTY THAT HE NEEDED WE DID OUR PART BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN A TWO WAY STREET IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION IN IN TERMS OF. ENSURING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PROPERLY INFORMED AND THAT ARE FEEDBACK HAS BEEN PROPERLY IN CORPORATE. AND IT AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S DONE A GREAT JOB IS TEAMS AT A GREAT JOB AND I WERE HERE AT THIS POINT WHERE. ALL WE CAN START RE OPENING SIR PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY I THINK IT'S- BUT BUT I THINK THE OVERALL QUESTION. HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT. THAN MANY OF THE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE FACE TODAY. I DON'T JUST GIVE YOU TWO TWO PARTICULAR STOCKTON TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TWO LARGEST CAUSES OF DEATH IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ONE WAS HEART DISEASE AND WE HAD SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DEATHS IN HEART DISEASE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAD FIFTY NINE. THOUSAND DEATH. BUT THE CAUSE OF CANCER IN THAT YEAR OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. YEP WE DON'T HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY. ON THOSE DISEASES THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT HAVE COMPLETE AUTHORITY TO DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO FIGHT THOSE. DISEASES AND OUT WHILE THE PUBLIC IS EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT THEY THEY CAN AND THEY SHOULD DO WE HAVE NOT TAKEN. MEASURES FROM AN OVERALL STATE STANDPOINT TO COMPLETELY- FIGHT THOSE DISEASES WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF FERVOR THAT WE HAVE WITH CALVET. NOW I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT WE SHOULD SHOULD VEER OFF COURSE I THINK THE COURSE THAT WE HAVE. BEEN ON IS ACTUALLY CORRECT I JUST THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A COURSE WHERE THE PUBLIC. AND IT LOOKS LIKE BODY WHICH IS CLOSE BODY ARE REALLY. OF THAT PROCESS AND PART OF THAT DELIBERATION IN PART OF. THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS SO. WITH THAT LET ME ARE TURNED OVER TO THE OUR VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. MR OBERNOLTE AND THEN SEE IF OTHER MEMBERS HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS MISERABLE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK YOU'VE SUMMARIZE THE ISSUE VERY CLEARLY THAT I COULDN'T BE AND- GREATER AGREEMENT WITH YOU THIS IS GOING TO BE AN UNUSUAL AND VERY INTERESTING HEARING. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BEING INVOLVED WITH CONTROLLING THE PURSE STRINGS. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY AND WE'RE DOING THIS HELLO OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH A VIRUS AND- WE'RE GONNA BE. THE GOOD THE BAD. WHAT ARE. A COUPLE OF MONTHS. GONNA BE OF A LARGER JUST THE WE AS A HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS NOW WHICH IS THAT HOW DO YOU BALANCE CENTRALIZE DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY IN AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITH THE DESIRE TO HAVE THE PEOPLE'S REPRESENTATIVES WAY- AND- IT'S VERY CLEAR IN THE CASE OF BOTH THE UNITED STATES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR LOOK AT OUR CONSTITUTION. THE INTENDED TO BE THE- CONTROLS THE PURSE STRINGS. SO IT'S GONNA BE VERY INTERESTING TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TALK ABOUT WHAT WENT RIGHT WHAT WENT WRONG OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND- MORE IMPORTANTLY TO TALK ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO STRUCTURE THIS DECISION MAKING UP A THIRTY GOING FORWARD SO I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT DISCUSSION THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU I SURE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERSHIP. DOCTOR REGULAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN FOR CONVENING. THIS HEARING AT THIS MOST CRITICAL TIME. LAST WEEK OUR GOVERNOR SAID DURING THE MAY REVISION OF HIS PROPOSED A BUDGET AND I THINK HE SUMMARIZED IT QUITE WELL. WHEN HE SAID THIS IS NO NORMAL YEAR THIS IS NO ORDINARY MAY REVISION. AS CHAIR OF SOMEONE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I'VE BEEN CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE EMERGENCY ACTIONS THE STATE IS TAKEN TO MEET BOTH THE MEDICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES OF THIS PANDEMIC. I'VE SAID BEFORE AND I WILL READ IT I BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENTS IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND SAFETY NET PROGRAMS OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC HELP. AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS PANDEMIC WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT LOSE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTH CARE IN BROOKSHIRE. MOVING OUR OUTCOME AND PROVIDING SAFE HARBOR FOR ARE WORKING FAMILIES THROUGH OUR SAFETY NET. I HAVE BEEN HARMED. BY THE COMPASSIONATE AND QUIRK ACTIONS THAT ARE GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN DURING THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS. AND THAT IS WHY I WILL BE CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE FOR A COMPASSIONATE FLEXIBLE BUDGET AS WE WORK WITH OUR ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COLLEAGUES AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO LAND A PUNCH. AS WE LOOK CLOSELY AT THE PROPOSALS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORTH. THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LA- IN THE COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE PUBLIC OUR PRIMARY DUTY IS TO ENSURE. THE VITALITY. THE HEALTH AND THE RESILIENCY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OF OUR ECONOMY. WITH THAT FRAMEWORK IN MIND I WOULD LOOK TO OUR PANELISTS TODAY FOR ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE AND INSIGHT TO HELP US TO CREATE THAT RESILIENCY DESPITE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. THANK YOU DOCTOR ABOUT SO WITH THAT WE ARE GOING TO START OUR- HEARING AND. ARE WE DOING I WILL FIRST WE'RE DOING THE FINANCE FIRST HELLO AND ALSO I FORGOT TO MENTION BUT- WE HAVE ONLY A FIRST IF YOU COULD ALSO I'M SURE THE READY IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT JUST DIRECTLY ADDRESSED THE NUMEROUS CONTROL FUNCTIONS THAT ARE LITTERED ALL OVER THE BUDGET. WHICH REALLY AUTHORITY AWAY LEGISLATURE AROUND NUMEROUS FUTURE APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND HAULING SAID WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING TODAY FROM A HANDOUT THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU I'M AND FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING ALONG HOME IT'S AVAILABLE ON THE ASSEMBLY WEBSITE OR AT ELLIE DOT CA DOC OF. JUST TO. ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. WHILE THIS CONVERSATION IS PRETTY TECHNICAL AND PRETTY PROCEDURAL AND I WILL- DISCUSS IN DETAIL THE VARIOUS CONTROL SECTIONS THAT ARE TO BE PROPOSED- WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO START WITH WHY WE VIEW THIS ISSUE I WAS SO IMPORTANT- AT ITS CORE. THIS IS REALLY A CONVERSATION ABOUT BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE. AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. AND HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE THINKS IS APPROPRIATE TO DELEGATE TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EMERGENCY. SO AT THE END I'LL GIVE OUR OFFICES OVERALL COMMENTS AND REALLY. THIS QUESTION- THIS QUESTION OF BALANCE. IS THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE THAT WILL INFORM- THE COMMENTS THAT I GET AT THE END. BEFORE KIND OF DELVING INTO THE CONTROL SECTIONS IN DETAIL LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE CATEGORIES THAT THEY FALL INTO. THE FIRST IS COAL BID RELATED EXPENDITURES THE SECOND IS NEW OR HYPOTHETICALLY NEW FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WILL BE RECEIVED BY THE STATE. AND THE THIRD ARE FEDERAL TRIGGER SO MANY DISCUSS EACH OF THOSE IN TURN AND THEN GIVE OUR COMMENTS ABOUT ALL OF THEM BROADLY AT THE END. SO TURNING TO THE FIRST PAGE ARE WITH- THE OVERVIEW OF PROPOSALS. THIS OUR CONCERNS CHIU DIFFERENT SOURCES OF AUTHORITY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS USED TO BOTH SPEND- OR ALLOCATE COALBED RELATED EXPENDITURES TO DATE. AND THEN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES THAT THE STATE USE I'M ON A FUTURE BASIS GOING FORWARD. THE TOP OF THE PAGE SEE TABLE THIS JUST SHOWS ON. THE STATE HAS SO FAR SPENT TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR. ON COVERT RELATE EXT. THE THIRTY OF THE I IT IS EXPECTING TO BE REIMBURSED FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BOTH WHAT HUSBANDS AND VOTE WHAT WILL BE SPENT- BUT INITIALLY ALL OF THESE EXPENDITURES ARE MADE FROM. THE GENERAL. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TAPE YOU SEE WHY IS BEING. AT THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISION ON A FUTURE BASIS AND SO THERE'S ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEING PROPOSED- AS A DIRECT ALLOCATION EXPENDITURE IN A VARIETY OF AREAS ACTUALLY JUST RECEIVED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO SPEND THIS THREE AND A HALF BILLION AND THEN. IN ADDITION THERE'S TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT'S CALLED THE KOBE CONTINGENCY FUND OR A COVERT RESERVE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROPOSING. SO THERE'S TWO PIECES OF AUTHORITY ABOUT ARE RELEVANT HERE THE FIRST IS CONTROL SECTION THREE SIX OF THIRTY SIX AND THE SECOND IS THREE HOURS LET ME JUSTTALK FOR EACH OF THOSE. CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX WAS PUT INTO THE BUDGET BY SB EIGHTY NINE SHORTLY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WENT ON TO RECESS. AND EXTENDED RECESS ASSOCIATED WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN. SO THIS WAS IN MARCH- THIS- WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A ONE OF BY UP TO A ONE BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD BE USED. WITH A SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO TO DATE O. HAS BEEN IT'S ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S BEEN SPENT. THE SECOND PIECE THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY IS THREE OH OUTAND THIS IS ACTUALLY A MORE LONGSTANDING AUTHORITY THAT ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRANSFER MONEY OUT OF THE STATE'S FLEXIBLE RESERVE ACCOUNT THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND INTO A SUB ACCOUNT KNOWN AS TRIO I'M- AND UNDER TRIO- THE% ADMINISTRATION BASICALLY JUST HAS TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THAT INITIAL TRANSFER ISN'T. AN SO FOR ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN SPENT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED UNDER THIS AUTHORITY- AND WE ALSO RECENTLY RECEIVED A BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THOSE FUNDS- TO WHAT PURPOSE THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING DIRECT. NO IMPORTANTLY- THE NEW FUNDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING AND THE MAYOR OF VISION ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS BEING PROPOSED TO CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED UNDER THAT CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX. A NOTIFICATION PROCESS THAT THE ORIGINAL ONE BILLION DOLLARS WAS TO BE ALLOCATED UNDER. TURNING TO THE NEXT PAGE. MINUTES TALK THROUGH TO CONTROL SECTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED AND THESE ARE REALLY ABOUT- NEW FEDERAL FUNDING BOTH FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN GRANTED TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING THAT IS HYPOTHETICAL- AND POSSIBLE IN THE FUTURE. SO THERE ARE AGAIN TO CONTROL SECTIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED HERE THESE WOULD BOTH BE ENTIRELY NEW PIECES OF BUDGET LANGUAGE. AND THE FIRST CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ZERO- IS WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE STATE WHAT ALLOCATE NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF WHAT'S CALLED CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUNDS THIS IS MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY CONGRESS IN THE CARES ACT. AND CALIFORNIA THE STATE GOVERNMENT OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THE TABLE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE JUST SHOWS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS CURRENTLY PROPOSING THIS MONEY WOULD BE. ALLOCATED IN THE MAY REQUEST PROCESS OF THE TOTAL NINE AND A HALF ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS JUST UNDER FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BUT HE DID TO STATE BUDGET. I'M AND THIS WOULD ESSENTIAL BE REPLACED% EXISTING STATE EXPENDITURES THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS FOR HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISTANCE LEARNING FOR EXAMPLE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO COUNTIES. AND NEARLY A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR CITIES NOW IMPORTANTLY. ELEVEN POINT NINE ZERO GIVES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH- A GREAT DEAL OF LATITUDE TO REALLOCATE THESE FUNDS NOW- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TO BE- THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION DOES REQUIRE THESE FUNDS TO BE SPENT BETWEEN MARCH FIRST AND DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. SO IF THE R. F. IS NOT SPENT IN THAT PERIOD OF THE MONEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE FEDERAL TREASURY SO UNDERSTANDABLY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION VIEWS IT AS IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF THAT FUND OUT ALL OF THOSE FUNDS STATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT BUT THE CONTROLS ACTION DOES GIVE RESTORATION PRETTY BROAD AUTHORITY TO REALLOCATE THE FUNDS EVEN THOUGH IT MINISTRY A LEGISLATURE WOULD ENACT PLAN. GEN POINT. THIS SECTION A SENSE INSIST THAT NEW FEDERAL FUNDING COULD COME THROUGH TO STATE IN YOU KNOW THE COMING WEEKS FOR THE COMING MONTHS AND THIS AGAIN ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS EITHER FOR BUDGETARY RELIEF TO REPLACE EXISTING GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES OR FOR YOU KNOW NEW PURPOSES DEPENDING ON WHAT'S ALLOWABLE IN- IN THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION. THEY HAD OUT NOTES THAT- NEITHER OF THESE REQUIRE NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY THAT HAS CHANGED- OR AT LEAST OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THAT HAS CHANGED- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING NEW CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE THAT WOULD. INVOLVE NOTIFICATION- SO ACTUALLY THIS HANDOUT IS UP TO DATE AS OF YESTERDAY MORNING- BUT THERE ARE- THIS IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING PROCESS AND OUR UNDERSTANDING CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. SO ON THE THIRD PAGE WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL TRIGGER LEGISLATION- OR FEDERAL TRIGGER CONTROL SECTION THAT IS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO ESSENTIALLY- THE MAIN REVISION PROPOSES A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE A FIFTY FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR ON BUDGET DEFICIT. ONE OF THOSE SETS OF SOLUTIONS IS ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN SPENDING RELATED REDUCTIONS. THOSE ARE SHOWN AT THE TABLE- IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAGE THERE. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS- CONTROL SECTION WOULD DO IS SAY IF FEDERAL LEGISLATION OR FEDERAL FUNDING IS FORTHCOMING IN THE COMING WEEKS OR IN THE COMING MONTHS. THAT COULDPLANT THESE- EXISTING POTS THEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WILL HAVE THE POWER TO ESSENTIALLY RESTORE THE CUTS THAT ARE MADE IN LAW. AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE A NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. FOR OKAY. SO THE FOLLOWING PAGE PROVIDES OUR COMMENTS. ONE THING TO START WITH IS THAT HE CONTROL SECTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED HERE DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM EXISTING BUDGET PROCESS SEES THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE SO- PASSED BUDGET AX HAVE ENVISIONED A SITUATION IN WHICH- FEDERAL FUNDING IS NEW AND ON ANTICIPATED AND COMES AFTER THE TIME THAT THE BUDGET IS PASSED OR THAT THERE IS A EMERGENCY OR THAT THERE IS A CONTINGENCY AT A DEPARTMENT FOR WHICH THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS NEW MONEY. THAT HADN'T BEEN CONTEMPLATED AT THE TIME THE BUDGET WAS ENACTED. THESE PIECES OF BUDGET CONTROL LANGUAGE GENERALLY INVOLVE A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THEY INCLUDE THIRTY DAY REVIEW PERIOD BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE THEY INVOLVE. THEY SPECIFICALLY INVOLVED LANGUAGE THAT PRECLUDES THE SORT OF CONTROL SECTION PROCESS FROM REPLACINGOR SUPPLANTING THE EXISTING BUDGETARY PROCESS THEY REQUIRE THE FUNDS TO BE ON ANTICIPATED THEY REQUIRE THE FUNDS TO NOT BE DISCRETIONARY- SO THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF THELIMITATIONS THAT EXIST KIND OF IN. JUST THE TYPICAL BUDGET PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THESE THESE ISSUES. NOW THE ADMINISTRATION PERHAPS REASONABLY- VIEWS IN THIS AS TOO RESTRICTIVE IN THE CONTEXT OF- BE CURRENT EMERGENCY THAT THE STATE IS FACING AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEN THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME LEVEL OF FLEXIBILITY THAT PERHAPS THE EXISTING IN SOME CASES THE EXISTING PROCESS THE STATE HAS IMPLEMENTED. DOESN'T ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO RESPOND SORT OF SUFFICIENTLY NIMBLY AND- EFFICIENTLY AS IT WITH LIKE IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT THAT SAID THE- PROPOSALS BY THE ADMINISTRATION IN THESE AREAS GO LIKELY TOO FAR IN SIDELINING LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND IN PRECLUDING THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO EXERCISE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND SO THOSE TWO AREAS AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT ARE REALLY AT THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE FOCUSED ON MOST AND LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES FROM THE CONTROL SECTIONS ABOUT ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN HERE. SO OUT WITH RESPECT TO AUTHORITY THE CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE THE ONE THAT- ANTICIPATES KIND OF HYPOTHETICAL FUTURE NEW FEDERAL FINES ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ON THE LEGISLATURE'S POWER OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THOSE FUTURE FUNDS IN IN WHAT IS. I CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX WHICH- WOULD IT BE THE CONTROL SECTION THAT WOULD GUIDE THAT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN CAN KOBE CONTINGENCY FUNDS REALLY AGAIN WITH ONLY A SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOCATE THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN CALL AS LONG AS IT WAS KOBE RELATED FUNDING REALLY WITHOUT AIR AND DECISION MAKING BY THE LEGISLATURE JUST NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN FINALLY- ELEVEN POINT NINE ZERO THE ONE THAT CONCERN TO THE NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN CORONA VIRUS RELIEF FUNDS REALLY ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO REALLOCATE THOUGHT FUNDING- IN. IN ANY MANNER AS LONG AS IT'S CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES DESPITE THE FACT THAT A PLAN WILL HAVE BEEN ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN MID JUNE- FOR HOW TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS. THEN JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES IN THE OVERSIGHT ROUND. SO THERE AREN'T ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS REGARDING- ALLOCATIONS MADE UNDER CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX IN IN THE CASE OF CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX REALLY THE FUNDING- REQUIRES A NOTIFICATION BUT NO SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT YOU KNOW CONTRACTS OR WHAT- OR HOW- VERY SPECIFICALLY THE FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED. AND THEN SIMILARLY ON THE- JURY- OF- AUTHORIZATIONS- ALTHOUGH THERE IS A NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT ABOUT WHEN THE FUND IS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE'S FLEXIBLE RESERVE ACCOUNT THE SFU TO JURY- OUT THERE IS NO COROLLARY TO- CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX WITH NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ULTIMATELY ALLOCATED. AND WITH THE CABBIE OUT THAT WE DID RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OUT YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS LAST NIGHT ABOUT THIS- TO DATE WE HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SPENT. THOSE THREE OFF FUNDS. SO THE FOR THE NEXT PAGE PAGE FIVE PROVIDES SOME OPTIONS AND WE REALLY VIEW THESE OPTIONS AS- SEEKING TO ACHIEVE A BETTER BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIONS. FLEXIBILITY IN LIGHT OF THE EMERGENCY WHICH WE DO UNDERSTAND IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. SO I WON'T WALK THROUGH ALL OF THESE OPTIONS IN DETAIL BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF THEM IN THE HANDOUT BUT I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT ONES. SO FIRST JUST TAKING THE ONES RELATED TO STATE SPENDING SO THESE ARE REALLY ABOUT CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX AND THREE OH UP- WE THINK THAT IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT PROCESS IN PLACE DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION OR NOT IN SESSION. SO SB EIGHTY NINE WAS ENACTED JUST BEFORE THE LEGISLATUR WENT ON AN EXTENDED RECESS IN RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. AND IT WAS ENACTED IN LIGHT OF THAT SITUATION. BUT PERHAPS A DIFFERENT NOTIFICATION PROCESS OR EVEN A DIFFERENT PROCESS ENTIRELY IS APPROPRIATE IF THE LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION- AND IS ABLE TO ACT MORE QUICKLY% THAN IT WOULD BE IF IT WERE OUT OF SESSION. ON ELIGIBLE USES OF FUNDS- JUST SOMETHING TO EMPHASIZE HERE IS THAT THE PANDEMIC HOUSE REQUIRED THE STATE TO ENTER INTO VERY NEW KINDS OF EXPENDITURES. NEW KINDS OF CONTRACTS THAT- YOU KNOW ARE ARE QUITE ATYPICAL FOR THE STATE'S- ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AND UNLIKE WITH OTHER DISASTERS FOR EXAMPLE A WILD FIRE WHERE THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE WOULD TAKE ON ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WILD FIRE QUITE KNOWN. IN THE ACTUALLY QUITE IN SEVERAL CASES THE- THE TYPES OF EXPENDITURES AT THE TAKE THE STATE IS TAKING ON A QUITE NOW. AND SO- ONE OPTION FOR CONSIDERATION WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THE TYPES OF ELIGIBLE FUNDS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE ALLOCATED UNDER DIFFERENT TYPES OF AUTHORITY AND WHETHER IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO PLACE SOME LIMITS ON THOSE TYPES OF ELIGIBLE FUNDS. THE FINAL PAGE- CONCERNS BE CONTROL SECTIONS AND THE AUTHORITIES THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED FOR FEDERAL FUNDING IN PARTICULAR AND SO THIS IS ELEVEN POINT NINE ZERO. ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE AND THEN THE CONTROL SECTION EIGHT TWO EIGHT. I GOT I WON'T WALK THROUGH THESE IN DETAIL BUT JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF NOTES- THE PROCESS AGAIN MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE LEGISLATURE'S AND- IN SESSION. ON ON TYPICAL CONTROL SECTIONS THAT THE STATE HAS IN PLACE FOR DEALING WITH ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL EXPENDITURES IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE CLEAR IN BUDGET LANGUAGE THAT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THE BUDGET PROCESS SO. THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A KIND OF LIMITATION- THAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE AGAIN IN THIS CONTEXT DEPENDING ON. YOU KNOW HOW QUICKLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRING THE STATE TO SPEND THE MONEY. AND THEN ALL THE FEDERAL TRIGGERS IN PARTICULAR SOMETHING THAT WE NOTED IN OUR OVERALL COMMENTS TO THEM A REVISION. IS THAT IF MORE FEDERAL AID IS FORTHCOMING PARTICULARLY IF SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL AID IS FORTHCOMING. IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RECONSIDER THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET NOT JUST- THE SPENDING REDUCTIONS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TO BE SUBJECT TO THE TRIGGER. AND SO IN THAT CASE- PERHAPS MID YEAR BUDGET ACTION WOULD BE WARRANTED IN STATEN. FINALLY IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO US WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. IF LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS NEEDED TO RESTORE THE SPENDING CUTS ARE LESS THAN FOURTEEN BILLION A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IS GIVEN TO THE STATE- FROM FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WOULD IT BE PRO RATED ACROSS A VARIETY OF DEPARTMENTS WOULD- SOME DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE CUTS AND OTHERS WOULD NOT- THOSE KINDS OF IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS BE CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE IS STILL SILENT TIM. SO WITH THAT- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS WENDY APPROPRIATE MOMENT ARISES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER TANG AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF TO RESERVE THE BALANCE OF THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS ON BEHALF OF THE ADMINISTRATION. THE FIRST IS THAT THE UPDATED ESTIMATES- THAT WERE IN THE NAY REVISION OR ALSO REFLECTED IN THE LETTER THAT WAS SENT LATE LAST NIGHT OURSTAFF HAS BEEN WORKING. DAY AND NIGHT TO CLARIFY THE EXPENDITURES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW WE ARE EXPECTING- NET GENERAL FUND COST OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE EXPENDITURES AND THIS REFLECTS- THE VARIOUS STREAMS FROM THE SECTION THIRTY SIX ALLOCATIONS UNDER SB EIGHTY NINE. TO THE TRIO ALLOCATIONS- AS WELL AS FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT THAT BEING SAID- I DO WANT TO STRESS THAT THIS IS A POINT IN TIME ESTIMATE- THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME IS VERY UNCERTAIN SO WE WILL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE ARE CONSTANTLY REFINING. OUR ESTIMATES- AND AS WE GET MORE DETAIL- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE WILL MAKE SURE TO INCORPORATE THAT AS WELL. I SHOULD MENTION THAT JUST THIS WEEK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND SOME GREATER FLEXIBILITY ON THE USES OF THE CORONA VIRUS FOR WE FIND. THAT THE LA- MENTIONED SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE AS WE UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES. THE SECOND ONE I WANT TO MAKE IS- WITH REGARD TO SOME THE CONTROL SECTIONS THAT I KNOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I HAVE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT. AND THAT THE LA- MENTIONED AS WELL. THE PURPOSE OF DRAFTING THESE CONTROLS ACTIONS THE WAY WE DID WAS TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT AND MAKING SURE. THAT THE STATE IS MEETING AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE MEETING ALL THE DEADLINES AND CONDITIONS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE USING ALL THE MONEY THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE ARE OPEN TO FEEDBACK ON HOW TO REFINE THIS CONTROL SECTIONS TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT CONSISTENT WITH NOTIFICATION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE- WHILE BALANCING THAT AGAINST THE NEED TO. ENSURE THAT IS A LITTLE OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE REVERTED BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR NOT MEETING THE CONDITIONS THAT WERE ALLOCATED. AS THE LA- MENTIONED- BASED ON FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE RECEIVED WE'VE ALREADY UPDATED LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON INCLUDING A TEN DAY LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION. REQUIREMENTS INTO SOME OF THAT CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE. SIMILAR THOUGHT WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRIGGER. THE PURPOSE OF THE TRIGGER IS AS WE KNOW AND HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. WITH ALL OF YOU. THE NAY REVISION AB REFLECTS AND BASS CUTS. IN THE BUDGET IN ADDITION TO PULLING BACK AND WITHDRAWING THE EXPANSIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY. THESE CUTS ARE VERY PAINFUL THEY AFFECT JUST ABOUT EVERY PROGRAM. AND SO WE'VE BUILT IN A TRIGGER WHERE IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES A CERTAIN OUT APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. ALL THOSE CUTS CAN BE RESTORED AND THEY WOULD AFFECT ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS. BUT AS MENTIONED WE ARE. HAPPY TO LISTEN TO FEEDBACK WHEN IT COMES TO ADDITIONAL IDEAS ON HOW TO SET UP THAT TRIGGER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING BE USED. A FEDERAL FUNDING AND AVOIDING THE IS CUTS THAT UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WOULD OTHERWISE GOING TO A FACT ON LIFE FIRST IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT. OF A BALANCED BUDGET. THE FINAL POINT I'LL MAKE IS I KNOW AND THE NEW KNOWS THAT THERE ARE PAN A LOT OF. ON THE- CAN. RESERVE IN THE MAY REVISION- WE HAVE PUT OUT WHAT WE EXPECT AT THIS POINT IN TIME. EXPENDITURES WILL BE- BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT THIS EMERGENCY IS ONGOING AND WHILE YOU KNOW TRENDS AS THE GOVERNOR HAS MENTIONED- HAVE BEEN GETTING A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AND WEEKS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE SUMMER AND THE FALL AND SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO DO. IS IN THE BUDGET PROCESS BILL DIDN'T BUILDING A CONTINGENCY SO THAT THEY IF THERE IS A HOSPITAL PANDEMIC. IN THE FALL ESPECIALLY THE LEGISLATURE IS OUT OF SESSION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO ACT. I THINK- WE ALL KNOW FROM SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD- THAT ACTING WHEN IT COMES THIS PANDEMIC. IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OR EVEN DAYS. COMPARED TO WINE ESTATE OR OUR COUNTRY MAY HAVE ACTED. COULD LITERALLY COUNT FOR HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF LIVES SAVED. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TO MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THROUGH THE SUMMER THROUGH THE FALL IN TERMS OF HOW THE X. EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE. BUT GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO GO. WE DO ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NECESSARY FLEXIBILITY. SHOULD THE PANDEMIC RETURNED TO HIGHER LEVELS ARE EVEN HIGHER LEVELS THAN WE HAVE SEEN UP TO THIS POINT. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO KEEP MY COMMENTS VERY BRIEF I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES TO DISCUSS AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER FREEZE WHEN IT AGAIN. DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR BROUGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE LA- AND THEN OTHER MAJOR MY QUESTIONS WILL BE FOR THE DEAL F. SO TO THE LA- BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE LAUGHED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND I WANTED TO RECESS WE PASSED SB EIGHTY NINE WHICH- INCLUDED THE SECTION THIRTY SIX. NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY- MY QUESTION TO THE LA- IS A DO YOU FEEL THAT THE NOTIFICATIONS PROVIDED BY THE DEAL F. HAVE MET THE LETTER AND THE SPIRIT. OF THE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN THAT SETION AND- WHAT COULD HAVE DONE BEEN DONE BETTER BY THE DEAL F. TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YOUR OKAY YES- OKAY THANK YOU- YES I WILL I GUESS ALL MAKE JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS- THE FIRST IS THAT. YOU KNOW. IN A IN A VARIETY OF CASES PROBABLY MORE INFORMATION CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED- I THINK THAT ONE ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ANDREA WHAT WHERE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MADE AN INITIAL TRANSFER OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO JURY- FROM THE ASSET FOR YOU- WITH- LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION JUST GENERALLY THAT THE THAT THE- TRANSFER WAS HAPPENING IN WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW THOSE MONIES WERE GOING TO BE SPENT AND WE WOULD REALLYEXPECTED AFTER THAT POINT THAT. THAT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FORTHCOMING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY WHICH DEPARTMENTS WERE RECEIVING THE MONEY AND SPECIFICALLY WHICH ACTIVITIES WERE GOING TO BE. THE MONEY WAS GOING TO BE USED FOR- BUT WERE QUITE SURPRISED WHEN WE DID NOT RECEIVE THAT KIND OF INFORMATION AND SO- YES I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF- OF OUT OF A LACK OF INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU AND THEN- FOR THE DEAL F. JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT- BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE- POINTS THAT I BEEN FRUSTRATED ABOUT. A TWO IS THE DISASTER RESPONSE REGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT- WE HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR INFORMATION. ABOUT THE ACCOUNTING OF WHAT EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN MADE OUT OF THREE OH- AND STILL HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED THAT AND I'M WONDERING WHY. THE DEAL F. IS DRAGGING THEIR FEET ON THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THAT. AT THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. THE WE HAVE CONCURRED IN- AND EVERY- NEARLY EVERY EXPENDITURE REQUESTED THE ADMINISTRATION IS MADE BUT THAT THE POINT OF CONTENTION HAS BEEN THAT WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T BEEN FIRST OF ALL NOTIFIED AHEAD OF TIME AND SECOND WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION WHEN CONCURRENT WITH THESE REQUESTS SO TO THE DEAL AFTER A WHY HAS THE TRIO- INFORMATION WE'VE REQUESTED NOT BEEN PROVIDED. SO I'LL COME A VERY BRIEFLY AND THEN I MAY TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT TO RESET CALIBER. AS WELL- WE DID PROVIDE NOTIFICATION YOU KNOW FOR THE TRIO I TRANSFERS AND THEN IN THE LETTER. THAT WE SENT OUT YESTERDAY WE SAW IN TERMS OF ALL THE- EXPENDITURES TO DATE AS WELL AS THE PROJECTED EXPENDITURES. PROVIDE CLEAR FINE DETAIL ON WHERE WE EXPECT THOSE TO GO OUT AND FROM WHICH ACCOUNTS YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE DIRECTING. FUNDING THE WAY IT'S BEING DIRECTED BUT LET ME TURN IT OVER TO RESET TO TALK ABOUT THE REAL EXPENDITURES IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL. HEY GOOD MORNING THERESA COLOR WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE. AS THIS. PANDEMIC HAS PROGRESSED AND THE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO EVOLVE AS WELL AND I JUST OUR NOTIFICATIONSONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN RESPONSE TO THEIR REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS THAT POSTING ON OUR WEBSITE OF THE ALLOCATIONS NOT ONLY FOR CONTROLS SECTION THIRTY SIX BUT AS WELL AS THE TO REAL ALLOCATIONS- AND THE TOTAL TO ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER IS ALSO POSTED AND BY DEPARTMENT AND BY PURPOSE ON OUR WEBSITE SO WE HAVE- ATTEMPTED TO TRY AND BE RESPONSIVE AND ALSO JUST IN. IN LIGHT OF THE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO THESE EXPENDITURES OKAY SO TO SUMMARIZE WELL WORSE YOU'RE HEARING US SAY WE DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE GOT THE INFORMATION THAT WE ASK FOR AND YOU'RE SAYING YES WE PROVIDED ISSUES SO THERE'S A CONFLICT SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN RESOLVE THIS OFFLINE BUT THIS IS THE LATEST IN A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR- FROM THE DEAL F. AND IN RESPONSE TO INCREASE FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT I THINK NEEDS TO STOP IF E'RE GOING TO. HAVE A REAL TRUSTED WITH FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS- YEAH AND I THOUGHT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- WHEN WE ASK FOR INFORMATION THAT THAT- THE DO YOU EVER CONSIDER BEING A BIT MORE FORTHCOMING ABOUT PROVIDING IT BECAUSE WE DON'T FEEL LIKE- THAT RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN THERE. I WANT TO ASK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE A POINT THAT THE LA- RACIST REGARDING THE- BUDGET CONTROL SECTION REGARDING THE FEDERAL TRIGGERS. AND IT WAS A QUESTION THAT- THE LA- ASKED THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANSWER TO YET WHICH IS IT I YOU'VE GOT THESE TRIGGERS AUTOMATICALLY SET TO OCCUR. ON LAST APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL AID TO THE STATE SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS IF. SOMETHING LESS THAN THAT IS RECEIVE WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS I MEAN ARE ALL OF THOSE CAUGHT CUTS MADE- PROPORTIONATELY TO THE AMOUNT THAT COMES IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IT A BINARY THING WHERE THEY'RE EITHER ALL MADE OR THEY'RE NOT MADE WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S THINKING ON THIS. YES LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS THE WAY THE CONTROL SECTION IS DRAFTED RIGHT NOW ON THE ENTIRE APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS AT LEAST THAT AMOUNT- WOULD HAVE TO. BE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES IN ORDER FOR THOSE CUTS TO BE RESTORED ACROSS THE BOARD. SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY- IF WE ULTIMATELY WILL RECEIVE LESS THAN THAT AMOUNT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER THE COMING YEAR. OR IF WE RECEIVE NOTHING ADDITIONAL CONGRESS DOES NOT PASS. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION- THOSE CUTS WOULD NOT BE RESTORED- AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO. WELL THAT ON. FEWER THAN FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY MONEY HOW WOULD IT BE USED ON THAT COULD BE A COMBINATION ARE. THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATING IT PER USUAL PROCESSES- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS A RELATED PROCESSES OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR- AS WELL AS ADDITIONALLY- ANY- COVERT NINETEEN. EMERGENCY COST TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE ALLOCATED FOR THAT REASON OR THEY FIT UNDER CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINETY FIVE. OKAY SO YOU'RE YOU'RE DIVISION AT THIS POINT THAT IT'S A BINARY PROCESS EITHER. THE AMOUNT PROVIDED IS MORE THAN FOURTEEN BILLION OR DOES NOT. THAT'S CORRECT IF IT'S- A WASTE FOURTEEN BILLION THERE IS NO ATOM NOT AUTOMATIC RESTORATION- FOR ANY OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN THE CHARTER. ALRIGHT SO I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE A- SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING HERE IN THE NEXT- COMING WEEKS- BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF PROVISION MADE. FOR IF THAT FOR FULL FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS DOESN'T COME IN- IN A AND A AND ALSO THINKING DONE ABOUT- WHICH OF THOSE CUTS WOULD BE MADE WHICH WOULD NOT. AT ALL. LASTLY AT I APOLOGIZE IF THIS IS GETTING INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT BUT- I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED DOING AND IT'S- ROUND OF CUTS TRIGGERED BY- THIS FEDERAL AID. OR THE LACK THEREOF AND THAT IS THE CLOSURE OF VETERANS HOMES- YOU KNOW MOST. WERE BROADLY BASED A CERTAIN PERSON IN THIS PROGRAM A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE FOR THAT PROGRAM BUT THIS WAS A YOU KNOW THE CLOSURE OF AN ENTIRE. DISPENSED PARTICULARLY WANTED MY DISTRICT IN BARSTOW AND I'M WONDERING WHY. THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS LIKE THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE. CUT TO BE MADE UGH YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS ONE OF MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION. YES SO THE BOND THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT BACK WITH OUR STAFF. WERE FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THOSE ISSUES YOU KNOW TODAY WE ONLY HAVE THE STAFF THAT ARE FOCUSED MORE BROADLY ON THE CONTROL SECTIONS. AND THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES BUT I WILL GET BACK TO YOU I WILL SAY AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW THIS. AS WELL AS ANYBODY OUT ALL OF THE WISCONSIN THE TRIGGER- ARE THE CUTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO MAKE A LEAST YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT. WITHDRAWING EXPANSION AND IS. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE IN THE BUDGET BACK IN PARTICULAR THAT'S THE REASON THAT THEY'RE IN THIS TIGER. THESE ARE THE POTS- THAT WE ARE REALLY HOPING WE HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR BECAUSE- AS THE GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS NAY REVISION CROSSTALK FRIEND STAY BREAK HIS HEART. SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN THE TRIGGER. OKAY THANK YOU YOU GOT AYE I THINK WE ALL SHARE. IN THE FEELING THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY OF THESE CUTS. BUT YOUKNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THE- IN ROOM AND TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT'S WE NEED TO BE. NEED TO BE MADE. I AND BALANCE THE BUDGET. THE SO THERE ARE I DON'T. IT WOULD BE RESPOND TO CUT. AND I'M SURE YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ANSWER. THE QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR. BURKE WITH. PROPER OF FINANCE HAVE. HEAVY COTTON. HOW YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE THE- COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOUR OFFICE IN THE LEGISLATURE. GET GIVEN. THAT WE NOW HAVE. A FEW FEW MONTHS OF COMMUNICATION THIS WAY AND AGAIN. JUST TO REITERATE WHAT MY MIND IF I SHARE- OUR VICE CHAIR SAID IS THAT THAT. COMMUNICATION REALLY HASN'T BEEN ADEQUATE AS FAR FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. YES A WE WANNA. BE AS ENGAGED AND COMMUNICATE AS MUCH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS POSSIBLE I'D DEFINITELY HEARING THE FEEDBACK AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE THAT WITH. COLLEAGUES OVER HERE AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES MORE SPECIFICALLY TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF SOME OF THESE CONTROL SECTIONS ARE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WERE DISCUSSING- WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS. AS MENTIONED- WITH THE- FEDERAL FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE AS THE LA- POINTED OUT OUR NATIONAL LANGUAGE  DID NOT HAVE LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION AND WE RECOGNIZED AFTER HEARING THAT HE THOUGHT THAT. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT NEEDS THAT KIND OF NOTIFICATION- INCLUDING A TEN DAY- WAITING PERIODS SO WE INCLUDE. INCLUDED THAT AND ARE REVISED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU BUT JUST BE CLEAR. THE WAIT LATEST LEGISLATIVE HAS GONE IN THE PAST HAS BEEN. EVERYTHING'S DONE. WHAT WERE YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE ANNOUNCING THIS AND- WE'RE GIVING YOU TEN MINUTES ADVANCE NOTICE OF WHICH THE OFTENTIMES THE ADVANCE NOTICE FROM YOUR DIVISION WOULD GO TO SAY OUR OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF BUT I'M STILL WATCHING TV TO GET MY NOTIFICATION. SO IT BET BIG THE QUESTION WHAT'S THE POINT OF A LEGISLATURE IF WE'RE LIKE THE PUBLIC WATCHING TV TO GET INFORMATION DOESN'T FEEL VERY DEMOCRATIC TO ME. SO I MISSED MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON. THE ISSUE O THE PPP AND THE AND THE MASK SO I GUESS THE BIG OVERALL ONE BEFORE I GET TOO SPECIFIC PART OF THE BUDGET AND A SECTOR THAT THAT NEEDS THIS PROTECTION. IS THE WHOLE- CONTRACT IN THE ONE BILLION AND I THINK WE GOT OVER THAT OVER AND OVER AND OVER BUT- IF IT LEADS TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT THE REASON THAT THE GOVERNOR DEAD AS AS CHAIRMAN TING SAID GO OUT AND ANNOUNCE THIS AND WE HEARD ABOUT IT ON. ON THE NATIONAL TV SHOW BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS WAS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA IN TO MAKE A MAJOR BOOK PURCHASING THAT FELL APART WHEN WE ARE IS- SCAMMERS THAT PUT TOGETHER AN INDUSTRY THREE DAYS BEFORE AND WIRED MONEY IT SOUNDS LIKE A- CRAZY TV MOVIE. MADE FOR TV MOVIE BUT NONETHELESS WE DIDN'T LOSE OUT A SIGNIFICANT WAY WOULD BE PROTECTED TAXPAYERS BUT A BEGS THE QUESTION WHERE ARE WE NOW ON THESE MASKS- WHERE WE OPENING OUR ECONOMY. WE'RE OPENING- IS THE SENSE OF WORKERS THAN THE DEFINITION THAT EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY BY THESE COUNTY ORDERS RIGHTFULLY SO- THERE COULD BE A SECOND WAVE AS AS WE AS WE NOW WE HOPE NOT SO. DEALS ARE AS WE WRAP AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME ISSUES IS AS- THEN I IT'S- CERTAIN SHIN SO PACKED. AFTER YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US PLAY. YES I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THE START ADDITION TO A SMALL NUMBER OF MY TO OF FINANCE HE WE ALSO. TINA CAR THEY GET THE AT WE ASKED AS WELL AS RIGHT SELMA. AS WELL AS MORE COMMITTED FROM AGE SO WHEN IT COMES TO THESE OPERATE OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS THERE ON HAND SO LET ME TURN IT OVER TO T. TO CURRY FROM YES RIGHT NOW. GOOD MORNING. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WHERE WE ARE ON THE MASTER STARES AT TWO DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT WERE PART OF THE BID CONTRACT- AS YOU MENTIONED THIS IS BEEN DISCUSSED AND IN PRIOR ON PRIOR HEARINGS WE HAVE AT THE END NINETY FIVE AS WELL AS THE SURGICAL THE SURGICAL MASKS WE ARE RECEIVING THOSE SUPPLY OR DISTRIBUTING THOSE SUPPLY- AS WE SPEAK AND HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST- WELL IT'S A NEGATIVE EVENT THAT REALLY. AND BASED ON THE IDEA TRACK SADDAM AT LADY. THE NINTH HOUSE TO. FOR AND NINETY FIVE FOR THAT PARTICULAR CONTRACT WAS WAS DELAYED- SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT PROCESS IS STILL ONGOING BUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT- THAT THAT'S MOVING ALONG. AND WE DON'T HAVE THE FINAL- FINAL AT AND CERTIFICATION YET BUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT THAT'S GOING TO BECOME COMING ALONG IN THE TIMELINE THAT. OTHER TELL YOUR POINT. BUT THE REAL US THAT UNKNOWN NATURE OF ANY TYPE OF RESURGENCE OR OR ADDITIONAL CASES WE WANT TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE IS PREPARED FOR THAT. AND WE ARE HAVE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN STILL AS THIS IS A NATIONAL AND WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC SO. ON WE HOPE TO SEE WELL THOSE WERE PUSHED OUT. FOR THIRTY DAYS WE HOPE TO NOW START SEEING THOSE EARLY NEXT MONTH WITH THE CERTIFICATIONS IN PLACE AND WILL CERTAINLY EVERYONE UPDATE ON UP. SO FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN PLAIN ENGLISH AS FAR AS- A BACKUP PLAN. WE'RE WE'RE COUNTING ON ON THIS- WE HAD SOME UNCERTAINTY OUT OF THE GATE AND WHAT LEADS US TO BELIEVE THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE AT A DONE DEAL GOING FORWARD AND WHAT'S OUR PLAN B. FOR THIS FOR THE AND NINETY FIVE MASKS. EIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ABSOLUTELY- TO GREAT POINT- A FEW THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN. PLACE AS A BACK UP IT WAS WORKING TO ORDER THE NINETY FIVE ASKED NOT TO- EXPEND FUNDS UNLESS WE NEED THEM BUT WE ARE STILL TRYING TO PUSH OTHER SORTS OF THE- INTERNET SUPPLY CHAINS OPEN UP. AND THE OTHER THING IS WE'RE LEVERAGING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BROUGHT TO THE TABLE. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STOCKPILE WE KNOW THAT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S OR OTHER STATES NEEDS. THAT THEY ARE SO- AT IT EXECUTED SOME NEW PROGRAMS DURING THIS PANDEMIC INCLUDING SOMETHING ABOUT CREATION ERROR PAGE WHICH WAS TO HELP THE FLYER SUPPLY. THE HOSPITALS IN THAT. QUOTE FIVE AND WE KNOW IT'S- OUR A KEY AREAS IN OUR HOT PULLS ARE RECEIVING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR- SUPPLY. EIGHT I'M IN SELECT. THEY WERE HEADING AND THE OTHER. THE CONTINGENCY WE HAVE IN PLACE IS WE CALL THEM I TELL. YOU CAN TO. UNITS WE HAVE TWO OF. IN CAL. THEY CAN- DEACON IN EIGHT. FIVE PASSED UP TO CAL AT. AND WE HAVE A FORTY OR FIVE HUNDRED DIFFERENT HOSPITALS THAT ARE SIGNED UP FOR THAT AND WE ARE ACTIVELY PUSHING THAT'S TRUE THAT IS NOT IDEAL BUT IT IS A ANOTHER CAPABILITY THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE AND TO CALIFORNIA. SO ALL THAT TO SAY IS WE DO HAVE- OTHER OTHER- CAPABILITIES THAT WE'VE AND LISTED AND ADDITION TO LEVERAGING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PUT INTO PLACE TO ENSURE. THAT THERE IS SOME SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES COMING IN TO THE PLACES THAT NEED THEM. OKAY TWO MORE ISSUES I WANT TO WHEN A PROBE.A ONE THIS IS OUR OVERSIGHT HEARING AND- AS CHAIRMAN TING SAID IT'S ABOUT GOING FOR BUT ALSO LOOKING BACK TO LEARN FROM. LEARN FROM THIS IN IN THE EVENT THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION AGAIN. AND WHEN WE MET A FEW WEEKS AGO IT HAS COME TO LIGHT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL ARE CONTRACT AND THAT. THE THIRD FOUR HAVE BILLION DOLLARS WAS WHY. TO THE- I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT WE HAD ANOTHER ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMUNITY THINK IT'S CALLED HOW TO HEARING A COUPLE WEEKS ON ON THIS I WASN'T THERE I DON'T THINK MADE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WITH THEIR- SO MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US ON. YOU KNOW THE LESSONS LEARNED AND WHAT WE WILL DO DIFFERENT- BECAUSE IT IS SHOCKING. WHAT% HAPPENED WHAT TRANSPIRED- IT'S LITERALLY IS. SOMETHING THAT IS AT FICTION TYPE OF A THING- AND SO IF YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE ARE DOING DIFFERENT WELL AS RECALL NOTED. IS A MAY THE STATE IN FINE OUT ON THE BANKS THE SOFT HEY THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT. SENDING TAPPED A BILLION DOLLARS TO A COMPANY THAT WAS CREATED THREE DAYS AGO. SO WHAT DO WE HAVE PLAYED. IN OUR NEXT AROUND REGIS IS THAT SOMETHING THIS. ANY AND SOME IS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY LET LEARN IN A IN THIS ERA SO AND WE DID DISCUSS THAT AT THAT THE HEARING YOU MEANT IT WAS THAT WAS ITWAS PRETTY ON THIS TOPIC SO WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THAT IS GOING FORWARD WE HAVE A STEP. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF. INTERESTED PARTIES THAT WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE P. P. E. SOLUTION WHETHER IT'S TO FOR SALE OR FOR DONATIONS. AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED A PORTAL FOR THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED A VETTING PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN EFFICIENTLY- TAKEN THOSE OFFERS UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW KIND OF WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THERE AND WHAT'S NOT THERE. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUSHING JUST THOSE THINGS THAT WE FEEL ARE VALID AND ARE USEFUL FOR THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S. INTO THE POLITICAL WORK PERMIT SYSTEM SO THAT'S ONE ASPECT THAT'S AVAILABLE ON OUT THROUGH THE COVERED NINETEEN. WEBSITE THE I'M OTHER HOME. AS WE- AND THIS IS GOING. ALL OF COUNTRY AND INCLUDING HEARING BUT FOR NOW IS THAT WE HAVE ENTITIES. PROMISES THAT WOULD PUSH ANSWER NOT. AND THEY WERE NOT MET. AND WE NEED TO YOU KNOW NOT BE SPENDING TIME ON THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO. TO AT PAN OUT OR OR PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED- SO AND SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN- SUSPECTED THAT- ARE FRAUDULENT- OR CRIMINAL AND SO WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO INVESTIGATE AND TO PURSUE- ANYTHING THAT WE FEEL THAT THAT FALLS INTO THAT AREA AND TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE FOLLOWING UP ON THOSE AS WELL SO- LOTS MEMBER ADAM AT PROCESSES IN PLACE AND SAFEGUARDS TO BE THERE ON ARE BETTING. BUT AGAIN- BEING ABLE TO. ABBY IF XIN AN ACT QUICKLY- AND- YOU GET THE PLOT. NEED PROTECT THAT THAT SALUTE. AND MARK THAT WE HAVE AN DEFINITELY LEARNING FOR EXPERIENCE IS THE LEARNING FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OTHER STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD IT REALLY HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED- LEARNING ABOUT SUPPLY CHAIN AND- JUST INCREDIBLE COMPETITION FOR THIS SCARCE RESOURCE AND SO- WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE LEARNED FROM THAT AND ARE INVOLVING AND GOING FORWARD WELL. I WILL MAKE IMPROVEMENTS WELL NEEDLESS TO SAY THE FACT THAT WE WERE PARTIALLY DUE TO NEARLY TOTALLY DUPED IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I THINK THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA AND EVERYBODY WATCHING IS- IS UP AGAINST THAT NEARLY OF EXCEL. I WITH WILL WE TAKE THAT'S THE EFFORT TO I. TECH DOES GOING FORWARD GOING BACK THE TO THE TO THE HOLD UP FROM- I FORGET AGENCY CALLED WHAT'S IN ITS THE- THE CERTIFICATION THE OCEARCH SAID. DIOS NILES SO. UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT WAS IMMINENT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO AND IT'S IS- GETTING LATER IN THE MONTH OF MAY IT WAS EARLY MAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. TODAY TOMORROW TYPE OF A THING SO WHAT'S GOING ON A WHAT'S THE HOLD UP NOW ON MAY TWENTY LOWER. WE'RE TALKING TO NIASSE REGULARLY ABOUT THE STATUS OF THIS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN THE IN THE TIME LINE AS WELL SO. BUT I CAN'T SAY AS WERE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND- RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING IS MOVING FORWARD AS IT AS EXPECTED ON THE NEW TIMELINE AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL. HAVE MORE TO- TO SHARE- IN THE COMING DAYS ON THE STATUS OF THAT BUT I CAN'T I CAN'T SAY THAT WE ARE VERY VERY CLOSE CONTACT WITH AN AYE AUSTIN KEEPING TABS ON. THIS IN YEAH FUNDING FOR AT AT TIMELY RESOLUTION. ALL RIGHT AND THEN LASTLY FOR THE- APPLICATION OF THESE PROTECTIVE- THIS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR SOME OF OUR INDUSTRIES OF COURSE- DOCTOR RAMBLE OUT TALKING GREAT. DETAIL ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY BUT THERE'S OTHER ESSENTIAL FACT ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND INDUSTRIES ONE IS THE CHILD CARE TO ST SCHOOLS- BEEN OPEN FOR HIS. FIRST ART FOR EXAMPLE ARE COUNTY WERE AND ARE AT THE STAGE TO OUR COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ISSUED. GUIDANCE THIS WEEK TO RE OPEN MORE CHILD CARE CENTERS AND THIS WAS IS A HUGE NEED IN OUR APRIL HEARING. FINANCE MENTIONED THAT THEY WOULD BE COMING SHORTLY TO- TO SCHOOLS IN CHILD CARE FACILITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND TO UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT HASN'T. MATERIALIZED WHAT'S THE DEAL THAT IS THAT BECAUSE OUR WAY FOR THIS BIG ORDER OR IS IT ARE THERE TWO SEPARATE THINGS GOING ON HERE WELL THERE'S IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS SEC- JEKYLL MASS LIKE. WEARING YOU HAVE A SUPPLY OF THOSE AND AS A MAN COMING IN THROUGH THE- V. WHY DO A CONTRACT OR PART OF THE BEAGLE DE CONTRACT AS WELL AS OTHER. BE A MAN. WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. PROCESS WHICH LED IS AS YOU. OUT HERE WAS A LARGE THAT. HAD IN THE LAST IN THE WEEK THAT AND- CHILD AT THE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE IN. IN THAT NEIGHBOR OF FIVE. MASS YOU KNOW OR TAKE I HAVE TO GET BACK IN THE DETAILS ON EXACTLY WHAT THE BREAKDOWN. THE TUBES OF THOSE BUT WE ARE WORK ON THOSE WITH HE JUST TREES OUTSIDE OF HEALTH CARE THAT NEED THE- PROTECTIVE THESE THE MAP IN ORDER TO REOPEN IN ORDER TO OPERATE SAFELY. AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NON HEALTH. SERVICES THAT WE ARE WORKING CHEAPER SOME. OF THE NEEDS. THAT COINCIDES WITH THE RE OPENING AND THE SAFE OPERATION OF THESE FACILITIES BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON THE SPECIFICS ON CHILD CARE WITH YOU AND WHERE THAT'S GONNA. COURSE ANY STANDING NEEDS THAT WE HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT OR NOT ADDRESS THAT WE- I'D LIKE TO HEAR THE DETAILS OF THAT TOO SO THAT WE CAN. GET THEM ALL THE- AS FAR YOU KNOW THE GUY. MONTEREY BASIS IS A- SOME WAY REAL ERICA IN BALANCING THE ECONOMY VERSUS PUBLIC HEALTH. AND A BIG PART OF THAT IS HOW PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK AND- PART OF THAT IS. SCHOOLS AND CARE FOR THE GREAT. SURE SO NOT ONLY AS AN OF FOR OUR ECONOMY BUT THAT SANITY FOR A LOT OF PARENTS OUT THERE FRANKLY A LOT OF MOTHERS WHO ARE. TRYING TO BACK- BURKE IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY OF. BEING A WHOLE SCHOOL TEACHER AND- AS WELL AS BEING A CHILD CARE PROVIDER AND IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE JOBS OPENING BACK UP AND GO BACK TO WORK HOW DOES THAT WORK IF THEY DON'T HAVE. OTHER PIECE TO MAKE TO MAKE A FAMILY WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR KIDS. AND SO. DO WE THINK THAT WE HAVE THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OUT THERE. TO OPEN UP SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE CENTERS DO WE THINK THAT WE HAVE THEIR THEIR THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF PROTECTIVE GEAR AND- AND THINGS IN PLACE TO MAKE IT WORK FOR OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE THAT'S- A BIG PART OF. GETTING THE RIGHT BACK AT. TEN PEOPLE GO BACK TO WORK. THAT DON'T HAVE THE OTHER ELEMENT GOING AT THE SAME TIME. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION VERY VERY IMPORTANT ALL SPEAK TO THAT- MASKS PART OF IT OF COURSE IS A LOT OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WITH SCHOOL RE OPENING I KNOW THAT WERE ACTIVELY IN THE STATE ARE WORKING- WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON GUIDANCE AROUND RE OPENING THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF THINGS BUT IN TERMS OF THE- OF THE MASKS AND WEARE WORKING- WITH THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. WE HAVE PROVIDED- THOSE THINGS THAT ARE FOR EXAMPLE WOULD SERVICE- THE DAY CARE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOLS SO THOSE THINGS THAT ARE OPEN NOW AND WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING WITH THE ACT WITH THE I. P. P. E. IN THE- AND- I. CERTAINLY FOR. PRESENT TIMING EVERY. LOOKS WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT NEED MIGHT BE- IN A COUPLE IT AGAIN JUST TO GO BACK ITS TERMS OF THE STATE'S ROLE IN PROVIDING PP EVEN WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING. DURING THIS TIME OF. URGENCY WHICH INCLUDES BUT THE RESPONSE TO KOBE BUT ALSO THE RE OPENING. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE SUPPLIES ARE VERY HARD TO GET IN BALK ACROSS THE BOARD STILL. SO WE'RE ALSO. SEEING THAT IT DISSIPATING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO SUPPORT THAT DIRECTLY. ALSO KIND OF KEEPING AN EYE ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND SEEING HOW HOW HOW THAT GOES IS THAT OF ALL IS OVER TIME. BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT'S GOIN YOU KNOW WHETHER IT- AT FINANCIAL IF THE FINANCIAL SITUATION AND IS. THERE THEN THERE BE A BILL IF PURCHASED AGAIN SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT. TOP WHAT WE DO NOT. TO SUPPORT RE OPENING AT. LET'S SEE AN THEN WE MIGHT. THAT YOU SUPPORT EFFICIENT PROCUREMENT. WHEN IT TO THAT POINT. OUT OKAY. SO THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN. OKAY WELL THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE AND THAT IF WE DON'T OBVIOUSLY- GET A RIGHT HAVE THE RIGHT SUPPORTS IT'S GOT TO BE VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO RE OPEN OUR ECONOMY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MCCARTY SO I'M JUST JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR- SO CAN YOU CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH A WIDE THEY KEY AND NINETY FIVE MASS FROM B. Y. DE WERE NOT APPROVED IN THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR NOT APPROVAL. AND IT WAS SET IN NINETY FIVE NOT A QUé NOT IN NINETY FIVE THAT WE- JUST TO CLARIFY THAT- THAT POINT SO OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT QUALITY WENT THROUGH TESTING YEAH- YEAH SO THAT PART WAS OF WAS WAS- IMPORTING TO US WAS NOT THE ISSUE THE ISSUE CAME BACK AT THE DOOR HEY WHAT. WAS ON. AT THE PAPER WORK IN THE IN THE CERTIFICATION IN THE FACTORY INSPECTION SO- SAID THAT. THAT NONETHELESS THAT IS A CORRECTION THAT HAD TO BE MADE AND SO THAT'S THE PART THAT- WAS NOT COMPLETE THE FIRST TIME AROUND THEY HAD TO BE RECERTIFIED WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE NOW WORKING THROUGH. HOPEFULLY THE FINAL STAGES OF. IT'S SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION I ASSUME THEN GET SOMEONE FROM MY OUR SHOP TO CHINA WHEN IS THAT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THAT HAPPENING. THAT'S ALL HAPPENING LIKE THEY WERE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MY OFFICE ON A REGULAR BASIS- BE PERHAPS NOT REALLY BUT- DEFINITELY VERY FREQUENTLY WITH WEEKLY THEY HAVE STAFF THAT ARE IN. IN PLACE IN THE FACTORY IS AS WELL AS HERE IN THE US SO WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSE BE I'M SURE THERE ARE UNDER THE TOP WING. THEIR PROCESS AND THEN THING IS HAPPENING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED- YOU KNOW SO WE'RE- SO THEY DO HAVE ASSETS IN PLACE TO FACILITATE THIS. ACROSS THE BOARD YOU KNOW THIS ONE- PROJECT I IMAGINE OF. VERY CLOSE. TO MAKE SURE THE WE KNOW WHAT THEIR TIME I AS AS A AFFECTS THIS PROCUREMENT BURKE GREAT THANK YOU I'M GONNA GO TO DOCTOR REGULAR AND THEN MR FALL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW FALLING IF I MAY BE AGAIN I'M GONNA GO IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION I'D I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE COVE IN RESPONSE EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE NAY REVISION THAT THE CHAIRS OUTLINED. BUT I WANT TO HAVE A FOCUSED DISPARITIES IF I CAN IS THIS PANDEMIC IS NOT EQUALLY FELT AMONGST ALL VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND AS OUR CHILDREN OUR ELDERLY AND OUR DISABLED OR FACING THIS DYNAMIC I WANT TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS IF I MAY. I WILL ASK A TOTAL OF TWO OF THE LA AND LOVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIKE STAR THE LAYOUT PLEASE. FIRST BECOMES. IS THAT REDUCTION WE'VE SEEN WITHIN MAY REVISION. THAT IS BEING CONSIDERED NOW WILL AFFECT THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND MY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE COVERT NINETEEN. EXPENDITURES THAT WE HAVE. HAS BEEN FELT MOST STRONGLY AMONGST POPULATIONS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST HEALTH DISPARITIES ALREADY AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND ONCE AGAIN THE ELDERLY. SO FOR THE LA HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO STUDY WHETHER THE EXPENDITURES THAT THE STATE HAS DIRECTED DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE OR HAVE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE. WHAT'S UP THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULARTHAT'S NOT A QUESTION THAT WE HAVE- INVESTIGATED IN DETAIL BUT- WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE A RESPONSE. THAT'S EXACTLY THE ANSWER I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING TO GET FROM YOU ONLY TO SHOW THAT WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION AND THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO ARE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INVESTMENTS. THAT WE'RE MAKING OUR WITH THE NOT TOWARDS DISPARITIES IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT ON. NEXT QUESTION IS FOR FINANCE. PART OF THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE MAY REVISED TO HELP US WITH THE COLD AND PANDEMIC WORD TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO PROP FIFTY SIX I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME ADVOCATE OF USING PROP FIFTY SIX FUND TO HELP US TO EDUCATE TO TRAIN AND TO RETAIN OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. AS WE KNOW NOW IS A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS IN PARTICULAR IN REGIONS OF OUR STATE. BUT THESE USES OF PROP FIFTY SIX REVENUES REALLY DO CREATE RESILIENCY AND OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES. PROVIDING CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE. FOR EXAMPLE PROP FIFTY SIX IS USED TO NOT ONLY HELP PATIENTS BUT PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE IN RURAL AREAS LIKE IN MY COMMUNITIES TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO. HEALTH CARE SERVICES THROUGH MEDI CAL OR FAMILY PLAN PATENT AT A PLANNED PARENTHOOD HEALTH CENTER THROUGHOUT OUR STATE BUT THOSE REVENUES ALSO HELP TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS ADAPTATION OF. TO ONE. SO DOES WHY NOT TELL FORECAST ABOUT THE LONG TERM FISCAL IMPACT. OF THAT DIVERSION OF FUNDS TO OUR STATE AND THE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE AS A RESULT. YES A SEVEN MEMBER UP AYE AYE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFIC- FEDERAL FUNDS MATCH DETAILS AND HOW THEY MATCH UP WITH THAT PROPERTY SIX SPENDING PLAN AST YEAR COMPARED TO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING. THIS YEAR WE WILL GET BACK- AND CIRCLE UP WITH YOUR OFFICE ON BACK I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE OVERALL VALUE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED THAT YOU DESCRIBED. CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AGREED WEST AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS IN OUR JANUARY THERE'S BUDGET. WISE AND WE WILL BOARD WORKING WITH. IN THE COMING WEEKS AS WITH ALL ROUTE HOW DO WE CONTINUE. TO HAVE THOSE PRIORITIES WHILE. IF IT. IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME I'M TO TELL YOU WHY I DO. AND PARENTHOOD I GREW UP IN A VERY POOR ZIP CODE IN FRESNO AND THE CLOSEST CLINIC WE HAD WAS PLANNED PARENTHOOD. MY SISTER'S FIRST JOB WAS THERE AND HOW THEY HELP TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE FOR A VAST NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS. MY CONCERN IS THIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S US NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO PULL DOWN. AND THAT HELPS US TO SUPPORT A HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES CARE TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND SO I HOPE. WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUNDING TEND TO USE. IN MY NEXT IS GOING TO BE FOR THE LA- AND IT'S TO HELP ME WITH SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE- I HAVE BEEN WORKING N A LINE OF THINKING AND- REALLY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT AS A LEGISLATURE. A FEW YEARS AGO I THIRD A BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE REGARDING MEDICAL LOSS RATIOS. AND IT'S A PROVISION WITHIN OUR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO ENSURE THAT PLANS. ARE SPENDING OUR PREMIUMS ON HEALTH CARE. AND IN THIS CRISIS MY CONCERN IS THAT M. O. R. IS RETROSPECTIVE AND REALLY LOOKS MANY YEARS. IN THE PAST AND DOESN'T PROVIDE US RESOURCES IN THE MOMENT. AND SO MY QUESTION FOR THE LA- IS TO WORK WITH MY OFFICE REGARDING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SO THAT WE MAY POTENTIALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO AVOID CLOSE OF ONE THIRD OF PRIMARY CARE OFFICES WHICH IS. BEING FLOATED DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC AND THE CRISIS THAT. WE ARE IN. SO IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT HEALTHCARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED BY KNOCKS KEEN TO HAVE NETWORK ADEQUACY. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE LANGUAGE WITHIN OUR BUDGET THAT WILL ALLOW US TO RETAIN THOSE RESOURCES DURING THIS CRISIS TO SUPPORT OUR HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA- FOR YOUR QUESTION AGAIN- I AM NOT THE-SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON- HEALTH MATTERS GIVEN SOCIAL DISTANCING IT'S JUST ME HERE TODAY BUT AGAIN OUR STOCK WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND I WITH YOUR STAFF. TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS REQUIRED THANK YOU AND- MISTER CHAIR ONE FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY. YOU KNOW MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WE'VE SEEN WITHIN THE REVISED ADDRESS THE ANTICIPATED INCREASES THAT WE EXPECT WITHIN MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT- AND I WANTED TO TALK IF I CAN ABOUT PART OF THE REDUCTIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING WITHIN BOTH. DEPARTMENT AGING WITHIN CITY BASS WITH AN S. S. P. AS WELL AS THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. AND WHICH ARE OFF SAID IN A TEMPORARY INCREASE IN THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE FOR A LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES UNDER COVERT NINETEEN. RELATED SPENDING NOW. BUT HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION VIEW THE CASE LOW AND SERVICES BEING PROVIDED IN A POST CODE VISIT NINETEEN FISCAL OUTLOOK. THE KILLER ELITE FOR POPULAR OPTIONS WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE ACCESS CARE PROVIDED IN A MORE FORMAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS A LONG TERM CARE. OR A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY HERE IS IT FEELS AS IF THERE'S A FINAL OCCURRING. THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE IN. MORE TRADITIONAL SETTINGS BE- SEA BASS OR M. S. S. P. THAT WE ARE FUNNELING PATIENTS INTO OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SINCE WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND TOTAL PATIENTS ACROSS THOSE FACILITIES WHAT HAPPENS POTENTIALLY POST EMMA SAYS HE'S BASS. WHO WAS HONORING THE SNAPS TO ONE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ADEQUATE TO THOSE PENSION. YES DOCTOR AND- ALTHOUGH SPECIFIC ISSUES SO I DON'T HAVE MY COLLEAGUES FROM THAT HHS UNIT HERE AND FINANCE WITH ME SO WILL HAVE TO CIRCLE BACK WITH YOU I WILL SAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE NAY REVISION AND WE ALL KNOW MANY OF THESE CUTS ARE. AND FALL THE FOCUS WAS ON TO PREPARE A BANK AT MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY SO MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW BEFORE I CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID OUT. OF THIS CRISIS. WITHOUT TO JUMP GROUP HAS AVERAGED TERMINATION HOOPS IN TERMS OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE PROPOSED CUTS THAT YOU CITED- AREN'T PAID FULL AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO. WAYS. TO MINIMIZE. CORE STEPPING BACK. THERE IS THE YOU MAY INCLUDING UP AND I SAYS P. RIVAS TODAY SERVICE SAID AS WELL AS A SET OF NAY CAL SO CALLED OPTIONAL BENEFITS ARE ALL AIMED AT GENERAL OF DOLLARS BUT UNDER SPECIFIC FOR THE LONGER TERM I KNOW SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE CIRCLING BACK WITH YOU AND I WILL JUST AND IF I CAN THE- YOU HAD MENTIONED THE MEDI CAL ESTIMATES AND- L. L. HAD DONE AN ANALYSIS AND SIMMS THAT YOU'RE APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS A OR- ON. THERE A SOLUTION. AS WELL AS SEEING THAT PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS WERE PULLED IN TO HELP WITH MEDICARE ALL AS WELL AS MCO WHICH- HAS NOW BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS MEETING ITS GOALS TO HELP TO SUPPORT A HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT TOO IS IN CRISIS IN THIS MOMENT. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DOCTOR READ MISTER FULL. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- WANNA START OFF WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES TO HAVE A CONVERSATION CERTAINLY. IN TIMES OF CRISIS I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO BE OVER COMMUNICATING A NOT ONLY WITH THE PUBLIC BUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR OWN PERSPECTIVE YEAR AND ONE ECHO- THE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR BUT JUST TO BE FAIR WHAT WHAT GRADE WILL GIVE. NOW FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IN CONSULTATION WITH LET. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M IN THAT POSITION AND TO ASSIGN GRADES- FOR THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK ALL I CAN SAY AND I KNOW THIS IS TRUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. ALSO CERTAINLY TO STAFF THAT WE'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THERE'S- A PEOPLE ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT AND EVERYBODY'S DOING. THE BEST WE CAN AND I THINK WE ALSO- AS MY COLLEAGUE- YES THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SAID THAT- WE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T DONE EVERYTHING. PERFECTLY AND WE LEARN THE LESSONS- FROM WHAT WE'VE DONE SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO TRY TO ACT OKAY AS BEST AS WE CAN AND WE'RE LICENSE FROM THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AND MONTHS. HI STEVE WITH AN AYE AYE NINETY ONE ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK THAT THAT. YOU IN AND YOUR- STAFF HAVE BEEN PUTTING INTO THIS I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TOUGH. DECISIONS OF THAT THAT THE MADE- IN TERMS OF THE- THE FEDERAL MONEY THE TRIGGER CUTS. OUT WHAT. WE WANT TO DELVE INTO THE KIND OF MORE TO THE DETAILS OF THE QUESTION FOR THE VICE CHAIR BUT WHY. IS THAT THIS WHY IS THE CHOICE OF THE TRIGGER BECAUSE BINARY- IF. LESS MONEY WAS RECEIVED BUT IT IS SIGNIFICANT SOME WERE TO COME IN. WHY IS THAT THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO NOT. OF REEVALUATE THE TRIGGER CUTS. TO PAY THAT DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH IS RECEIVED. FROM FOR GOVERNMENT. WHY IS IT WHY THE FOURTEEN BILLION OR NOT OR AND OR NOTHING. YES THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I SHOULD. EMPHASIZE THAT IF WE GET LESS THAN FOURTEEN BILLION I'M IT'S NOT THAT WE LOSE THE MONEY OR THAT THE MONEY GOES OF WHY- INTACT AND I KNOW ONE OF THE BROADER THEMES OF THIS HEARING. IS ADJUDICATING AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER BALANCE. BETWEEN LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO THESE DECISIONS SO. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SPECIFIC PROVISION ON IF IT'S LESS THAN FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ON IT I THEIR- RETURNS TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROPRIATION. UNLESS SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED FOR COVERT NINETEEN RESPONSE AND MY COLLEAGUE I CAN SPEAK TO THAT WITH REGARD TO CONTROL SECTION. ELEVEN NINETY FIVE THE EMERGENCY EXIT. BUT IT DOES COME LESS THAN. FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. WE SIR. ALWAYS THAT THE- OR THE DRUG OF FINANCE READY. PICKS AND CHOOSES- AMONG THE PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF WHAT SHOULD BE FUNDED- CERTAINLY I KNOW SOME SUGGESTED- PROVISIONS WHERE THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND OF PRO RATA- ACROSS THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WHERE YOU KNOW IF YOU GET HALF OF THE MONEY. EACH CARD IS RESTORED BY TERMS OF WHAT WOULD BE PASSED IS THAT IF WE GET THAT WHOLE AMOUNT AND WE ARE CERTAINLY HOPING IT PUSHED. EVERY WITH OUR FEDERAL GET A CALL NOT ALL THOSE BASS CARD BE RESTORED. AND THAT WE DON'T IN FORTUNATE SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T GET THAT WHOLE AMOUNT. THEN WILL BE A CONVERSATION WITH THIS WAY. OR THAT ANY THAT IS FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IS TYPICALLY FOR COMING NINETEEN RESPONSE THAT WE WOULD MAKE SURE TO SPECIFICALLY FOR CO. IN RESPONSE. IN THE- V. L. ONE POINT A BILLION THAT WAS RELEASED INITIALLY REQUESTED I THINK IT'S FOR THIS AMOUNT OF FOR THIS MONTH YOU'RE YOU WERE LOOKING TO SPEND BUT THEY LET THE MINISTRATIONS ASKING FOR ONE POINT EIGHT THREE ONE BILLION FLOW OF FOR- NECESSARY- SPENDING FOR TILL JUNE THIRTIETH IS THAT CORRECT. END OF THE FISCAL YEAR YESTERDAY. IN A YOU DETAILED AND COLLEAGUES- THAT IN THE LETTER THAT WAS RECEIVED- IF YOU BREAK DOWN- AND BROAD CATEGORIES BUT- MAYBE CAN YOU JUST SHARE CAN IS THERE MORE A MORE DETAILED BREAKDOWN I MEAN IT'S SO LIKE ONE POINT THREE BILLION IT'S A PICTURE OF YOU KNOW IN A PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ARE THOSE FOR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE THE IS THE MINISTRATION LOOKING TO GET NEW CONTRACTS AND- FORCE. AND OF COURSE IT AND IN THE OP. UNDER THE OTHER ITEMS YOU KNOW HOW DOES A BREAKDOWN SPECIFICALLY OR WOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION. YES TO SOME OF OUR FONG LET ME TURN IT OVER TO A COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES AT TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE READY TO SHARE RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE DON'T HAVE WE CAN ALSO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE. I THREE SEC OUR A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES ATTACHED TO THE LETTER AND IF YOU'RE- OUR OFFICE IN RECEIVING WE CAN HELP MAKE SURE YOU GUYS. THAT I'M LOOKING AT OKAY THERE'S A VERY ATTACHMENT THAT ATTEMPTS TO BREAK IT DOWN TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ON SOME OF THOSE LARGE CATEGORIES A LARGE CATEGORIES ARE. IN THE NARRATIVE DESCRIBED WITH- THE AMOUNT AND SO DID WITH THAT HIGHER LEVEL CATEGORY BUT WE DID ATTEMPT TO ALSO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT FOR THEM ESPECIALLY THE HOSPITAL MEDICAL SEARCH CATEGORY IN THE PROCUREMENT CATEGORY PARTICULAR. WITCHER SOME OF THAT THE LARGER ARE THE LARGER COMPONENTS TO THE REQUEST. OKAY WELL I II AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS THE CHART IS BUT CERTAINLY- GOOD I I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IS AS MISS MCCARTY SET. ME UP THERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET PP IS WHAT ARE THE WHAT HOW MANY CONTRACTS EXIST A CONTRACTOR GAUCHE NEEDED. THAT WE CERTAINLY THIS YEAR THANKS. TRYING. A SHOP. OR LINE BY LINE I. IS A FULL. YES FOR SOME OF THESE FOR SOME OF THE THIS IS THAT IS AND ARE WORK AND BASED ON INITIAL WITH A STAFF WE ARE ALREADY INTO WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN PROVIDE AND YOUR QUESTION OF THE NOTION OF NEW VERSUS EXISTING CONTRACT IT IS A BIT OF A MIX- AS PRIMARILY EXISTING CONTRACTS BUT WE ARE WORKING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT EVEN. EVEN MORE GRANULAR LEVEL OF DETAIL THAN WHAT THAT AND WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THE- I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN I. OTHERS A AND THIS CHAIRMAN THAT I SAYING. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS PAST BEHAVIOR AND RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN HEAR FROM US IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE PAST BEHAVIOR HAS HAS BEEN HAS TAKEN PLACE AND SO- FROM FROM MY VIEW AND I DON'T I WON'T SPEAK FOR THE CHAIR BUT IF THAT BEHAVIOR DOESN'T CHANGE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL PHOTOGRAPHERS IN TO ENSURE THAT WE- THAT WE NEED I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU RESPOND ONE OF THE DOCTOR WERE NEXT YES WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF BEING HERE TODAY. WE HAD INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS ALSO YESTERDAY THE PUBLIC SAFETY- COMMITTEE AND CONCERN THAT WE PROBABLY DIDN'T GET ALL THE ANSWERS THAT WE WANTED TO GET AND SO MAYBE SOME OF THE OF THE DIGITAL STAFF THAT'S THERE TODAY CAN PROBABLY ANSWER. ONE OF THE THINGS OF COURSE THAT WE'RE WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET ITSELF THAT- OF ALL THE ENTITIES- WITH REGARDS TO WHO'S HAVING CUTS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. THE ONE GROUP THAT SEEMS TO BE NOT TAKING MANY CUTS THE CDC ARE. IN TERMS OF ITS FAIR SHARE CUTS. OF AND I SOON SOMEONE CAN TELL US WHY. AND YET THERE ARE THINGS CUT IN CDC ARE THAT ARE PROBABLY MORE. ORIENTED TOWARD WHAT THE MEMBERS WANTED TO YOU KNOW ARE. ARE A- I SEX TRAFFICKING OR SIX CRIME AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S IS SLATED TO BE ELIMINATED. THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE FOR- TRAINING AND POST TRAINING IS BEING SHIFTED AROUND AWAY FROM. WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD BE CONTINUING ABOUT USE OF FORCE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE- BIAS TRAINING AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO THERE'S SOME. DECISIONS BEING MADE THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE MADE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REALLY RELATED. TO THIS CRISIS AND YET STILL KIND OF REMAIN THE SITE. IS SOFT APPROACH AND A DECISION FOLKS MAKING. AND ARE COUNTED WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN IN THE PAST THE RIGHT. INTO A PRO SO WITH. OF I'M KINDA CUTE ABOUT HOW STILL ARRIVE AT THE- AMOUNT FIRST YEAH. AND YES SOME OF THE PRO. WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT TRAINING AND STICKS AMONG PEOPLE IN. THIS BILL KIND OF. THANK I GET THE NUMBER. RIGHT PLACE IN TERMS OF THE IN SO I MANY OF MARK WHO WHY DO SEES R. SKATE ANYTIME OF WHAT WE IT COULD TO BE REASONABLE. THE OTHER THING I IS THAT YOU CAN ANSWER FOR ME TO IS THAT WE ASK THE QUESTION YESTERDAY ABOUT- AND IDEA TO ABOUT THE- CLOSING THE PRISONS THAT WE HAVE SLATED TO CLOSE TWO PRISONS IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND THAT SOUNDS GREAT UP IT WHAT WHAT KIND OF WONDER ONE IS HOW CAN WE PREDICT OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WOULD BE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CLOSE WE DON'T KNOW I WOULD HAVE TO DO. WITH WITH REGARD TO THE- IN TERMS OF WHERE THESE THIS. PRISON A WHAT SO HOW DO KNOW THAT. HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO SAVE IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE PRISON THAT WERE CLOSING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO CLOSE- WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS THAT. THERE ARE STILL SOME- CAPITAL OUTLAY THAT PEOPLE ARE PROPOSING AND YET WE DON'T KNOW WHICH PRISONS TO. TO CLOSE BECAUSE WE'VE CONCERNS OF WE DON'T. RIP ABATE PRISONS AND THEN TEAR THEM DOWN SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY GET THIS SLATED TO BE JUST UP TO BE. CLOSED IN YET WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA AT ALL. IT SEEMS IF GIVING FOR YOU TO DETERMINE. WHICH ONES OF THE PRISONS TO BE CLOSE TO SEE ACR. AND WE HAVE ASKED CDC ARE FOR THE- YEARS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN. OF THE CLOSING PRISONS AND HAVE NOT WRITTEN PROP. LINE THAT IT MAKES. TO THE LOS WHAT. IS OUT OF. WITH THIS AND IS TO BE USED. SO WE SOME REAL CONCERN ABOUT. HOW THIS BUT FITS TOGETHER AND WITH THE NOT THE- IS ACTUALLY. BECAUSEWE DON'T SEE TO GET THE KIND OF INFORMATION KIND OF PLANNING A STRUCTURE- THAT SHOULD EXIST IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THESE MAJOR MOVES. THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THE- JUVENILE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. PROPOSING TO BE MOVED WE SCRIPT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME LAST YEAR TALKING ABOUT IT TO END UP WITH NOTHING NOBODY MOVE ANYWHERE. NO MONEY WAS IT ALL I MEAN A LOT OF CONVERSATION A POLICY PEOPLE SPEND MONEY GOING ON TRIPS. AND FOR HAVING CONVERSATIONS BUT IN THE END WE END UP WITH DJJ STILL IN THIS PLACE. DESPITE THE EFFORTS TO SAYS IS GOING TO GO MOVED INTO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. SO THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS ARE HERE IN THE BUDGET THAT IT JUST KIND OF SLOW. DOWN AND IT DOESN'T PEERS IF THERE'S PATH. TO CHRISTMAS SO MAYBE. SOME TO TELL US AND THEN ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT YOU PLAN TO. AFTER WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME FIGHTING TO GET OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL. IN A POSITION TO BASICALLY BE IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THIS AND MAKE SURE THERE'S A SEPARATE POINT OF VIEW WITH. ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE COMING IN AND OUT CONCERNING PRISONS. OF WE END UP AT THE SAME TIME US. TRY LOCAL. A MUSLIM. OPERATION THIS IS. IT ALL THESE PEOPLE LIMóN EIGHT PURPOSE OF THAT WOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT GOING HAPPEN. WE HAVE A COMPLAIN GOING LIKE CRAZY COMING IN CONCERNING THE FOR- HERE TALKING ABOUT CLOSING PRISON WHAT KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW WHICH ONES LEAVE INNOVATIONS WHICH ONES DON'T. AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THE WARNS OF KNOCK ON TELESCOPES NOBODY ONCE IT'S CLOSE THE PRISON SAID THEM YEAH. SO THERE IS HOPE HER EXPECTED GENERAL. SUPPOSE WE TRIED ALL THE STUFF NOW WE'RE HAVING YOU GUYS CUT HIS PROGRAM. AND YET AT THE END. I LIVE IN I HAVE I STILL HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING INTO. INTO THIS WHILE REDUCING POPULATIONS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO. MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT IT AS MY STAFF OF THE MEMBERS. CAN ASK. ESTá HOW RIGHT AT. LEAST THAT'S HOW DO WE ARRIVE AT. THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE HERE THAT HAVE BEEN ON. THE BOOKS FOR. TO YEARS. AT NO STAY. TAKEN EVEN. MEANT ANY OF THESE PROPOSED AND I'VE IN A IN ORDER NOT FASHION. AND SO IT'S THESE VERY DISTANT. VILLAGES IT STOP. AT THIS UP. WE AND THESE. IS FOR. DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWER THE WOULD MAKE TO MAKE HIS MOVE IN A STANDARD. AND MY FEET IS THAT WHEN MONEY COMES IN BECAUSE WE. DON'T HAVE I AM. NOT WOULD YOU. IT FOR THE- WE WILL DOUBLE WHAT THEY LARGE BUDGET OUT THAN WHAT IS TO BE WE BE IN A FOR WHERE WE TO PAY FOR ALL THIS STUFF THAT WE CLING WILL TO ELIMINATE THAT WE DID. SO WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT. YEAH WELL DOCTOR A WEBER I WILL SAY I DON'T MY PUBLIC SAY COLLEGE WITH ME BY YOU KNOW DAY. IT IS CERTAINLY HAPPEN A NUMBER OF THE TO SAY ABOUT THIS ISSUES I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD ANSWER ALL THOSE THOSE ARE ALL REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS AND- THEY JUST- YOU KNOW THEY TELL ME THEY'RE WATCHING AS WELL SO THEY WILL. FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THAT'S THE CAT- BUT HUNTING YESTERDAY EITHER SO OKAY. OKAY YEAH SO I WILL MAKE SURE FIRST OF ALL THAT- OUR DEAL OF COLLEAGUES WHO WORK ON PUBLIC SAFETY GET BACK TO ON THESE ISSUES- I WILL JUST MAKE. THREE POINTS. OUT THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE BROADER STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET AND- CDC ARE TO THE POINTS YOU MENTIONED. THE FIRST POINT IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES. YOU AT CDC ALL. PARTICULAR THERE SURE ARE SOME COURT ORDERED MANDATES. THAT WE HAVE TO COMPLY WITH AS A STATE YOU KNOW UNDER- UNDER THE ORDER OF A JUDGE. SO FOR THIS REASON. SOME OF THE SPENDING- AND- MADE THE POINT- DOESN'T GET REDUCED- THE WAY SPENDING IN OTHER CATEGORIES- MIGHT. HAVE TO BE REDUCED TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THESE COURT ORDERED MANDATES AND CERTAINLY. THE STATE. GOVERNOR THE ADMINISTRATION. AGREES WITH YOU IT AT. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN OVER TIME TO. IMPROVE REHAB REHABILITATION- AND CONTINUE. DOWN TREND. STATE AND POPULATION BUT- I SUPPORT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND IT SAVES. BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING- THAT CAN BE DONE. IN JUST ONE YEAR- BUT THE SECOND POINT. WHICH YOU ALLUDED TO IS. WHEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED HIS BUDGET IN JANUARY. PROPOSED CLOSING. UP ONE PRESENT. NOW WITH THE MAY REVISION OVER. FIVE YEARS NOW THE MAYOR- HE IS ABOUT PROPOSING A CURRENT POPULATION TRENDS HOLD. THE CLOSER. TO PRESIDENTS AND NOW. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY RIGHT NOW- EXACTLY WHAT THE SAVINGS WILL BE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW. WHEN THE FACILITIES EXACTLY WILL BE CLOSED. THE METS. OR WHAT SIZE FACILITY WILL BE CLOSED. THAT'S BASED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS. I REMEMBER TALKING TO CHARGE HIM. WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. WHAT IS THE ISSUE. IS THAT. I'M GOING STAVING. ONCE DISCLOSURE DOES COME TO. PASS THAT. OPEN AT. TEN THOSE ARE THE SAVINGS THAT WE- HE- AND BUDGET FOR THAT CATEGORY. ON THE DOES ARE THE TWO MAIN POINTS AND I THINK LAST POINT IS. YOU MENTION DJJ. AT THAT NOW THE- GOAL IS TO. REALIZE THAT THE COUNTY. AND I KNOW. THAT. WILL BE ABLE TO. BUY MORE DETAIL ON. BEFORE WE REALIZE WHAT THE NOT THIS IS ACTUALLY A BALANCED BUDGET OR NOT AND EVEN IF WE MAKE REVISIONS INTO JULY OR- AUGUST. WE NEED TO KNOW IF THESE A REALITY THAT THIS STUFF WILL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE. AND THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO BASICALLY SEE THAT. THE RESULTS THAT WE THINK WE SHOULD SEE IN TERMS OF THAT. THE OTHER PIECE THAT IT DIDN'T I MEAN SINCE. MUCH OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE COVERT RELATED- TERMS OF. WHAT WE'RE DOING. HOW DOES YOU KNOW WE ARE FACED RIGHT NOT AYE PRISONS WITH AN INCREASE. IN THE VIRUS. AND OF THE DRAMATIC% INCREASE IN SOME OF THE PRISONS- AND YET I DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF PLAN HERE AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO IT. AND THE DATA WE GOT THE OTHER DAY MY STAFF GOT ME DATA CONCERNING. OF THE INFECTIONS NOT ONLY A YOU KNOW YOU GET LIKE. TWO STAFF PEOPLE GET INFECTION AND THEN WE LOOK UP THE NEXT WEEK OR SO WE GOT A HUNDRED. PRISONERS WITH THE SAME WITH THE INFECTION SO I MEAN IT AND- AND SO IT'S REALLY. OF BECAUSE AND I KNOW THIS TEST. BUT I DON'T SEE EVEN A PLAN TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH. IN THE TACKLE. IN TERMS OF. FOLKS ARE GETTING THE INFECTION WE CAN'T JUST LET IT HAPPEN I MEAN WHICH IS A ALMOST. THE THOUGHT IT SENSIBLE TO SAY. THAT THESE ARE THAT. WAS THE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THESE ARE EXPENDABLE PEOPLE WHICH I DON'T THINK THERE'S SUCH. A GROUP ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH THAT ARE EXPENDABLE BUT- CLEARLY- UP I WOULD ASSUME THAT THERE'S THAT MUCH OF A SOME OF THE CONVERSATION. WOULD BE A RAP ON WOULD BE DOING WITH THE PRISON POPULATION. AND I KNOW MY COMMITTEE WE'VE ASKED AND WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN A VERY GOOD PLAN. AS TO WHAT'S GOING TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR PRISONS WITH REGARDS TO THE INFECTION AND THAT LOOKS LIKE THOSE PLACES ARE GOING TO BE THE HOT SPOTS. YES I WANTED OPPOSITION FIRST. TO TRY YOUR POINT WANT TO CLARIFY MAKE VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO OF EXPENDABLE POPULATION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S TOP OF MIND FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE STEPS THAT WE DID TAKE WAS TAKING STEPS TO PAUSE AND TAKES OF THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM WHAT THIS EMERGENCY OUT REGULATE THE POPULATION SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS GIVEN THIS AGENCY I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON SOME OF THE DETAILS IN TERMS OF THE PLAN FORWARD THAT YOU MENTIONED OF MY COLLEAGUE MARCO IS HERE- I DO WANT TO CHECK. IF HE MAY BE ABLE TO SAVE ITS OFFICE MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL. DR WEBBER MY NAME IS MARK IMAGINE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH OUR CDC COLLEAGUES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AS WELL AS THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH JURISDICTIONS WOULD THAT HAVE PRESENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AT THE STATE LEVEL. ARE DOING TWO THINGS ONE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AROUND INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL. AND MEASURES THAT EACH OF THE PRESENCE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF. SLOW THIS OF THE VIRUS THEN THE- THINGS. AND WE'RE ACT. WORKING WITH REGARDS WITH CDC ARE I HAVE WITH REGARDS TO TESTING. AND THE ABOUT THE HAVE CDC ARE TO BE ABLE TO TEST IN EACH ONE OF THOSE PRESENT SO. WE ARE BOTH PRIVATE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO CDC ARNIE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRESENCE FROM THE STATE LEVEL. BUT WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE PRESENCE IN THE- STATION. SOUNDS GOOD WE- CAN HOLD TO THAT I WOULD NEED THE ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN TO. PLEASE STOP. NOW FOLKS BEING ADMITTED IN HAVING THEM. IN THE- THAT DOING THAT TIME FRAME THAT THEY WOULD BE PUT IN PLACE A VERY. ACTIVE AND CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD PROCESS OF WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PRISONS IN TERMS OF. LETTING AN ADDITIONAL FOLKS TESTING FOLKS WHO LIED SO FORTH AND SO ON AND WE BASS FOR THAT AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE. A CLEAR SET OF. GUIDELINES OF STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING USED TO- FOR THE EVEN IF WE'RE LETTING FOLKS OUT. A COUPLE OF MONTHS. YOU HAVE THE ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS PROTESTED BEFORE THEY SENT TO THE COMMUNITY. OF THOSE WHO BEING BLOODY AND HAVE THEY BEEN TESTED YOU KNOW AND IF THEY ARE WHAT DO THEY GOAL AND WEARS A BIT AND YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN DOING THIS. AND IT AND THEN IN ADDITION THAT ARE WE TESTING OUR STAFF WILL PROBABLY BRING IN ANY AND- AND SO. THAT THE THAT'S- THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS THAT WE THOUGHT OF DOING THAT HIATUS. I WOULDN'T AND MEETING WILL THAT. BE AND HE'S BUDGET TALK ABOUT THAT PLAN. AND DOES NOT THAT WE HAVE NOT REACHED THE POINT. WE CAPS PEOPLE. WERE ALL WORKING TO THEIR I DON'T THAT. OF BECAUSE SEE THE IN. SEEN THE ACT JACK. OR SOMETHING. IS THIS. WE DO. WHEN IT. IN THESE. DAYS OF ASPECT THAT WE HAVE TO FACTOR IN. IN TERMS OF HAND. THE VIRUS. I HOPE AT SOME POINT WE SEE ACTUAL. BUT THAT WOULD BE THE- AS WE TRYING TO RE OPEN THE REST OF THE SOCIETY. THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH THESE HORRIBLE HOT SPOT WELL THAT WOULD LETTING PEOPLE OUT WHO ARE INFECTED. OF WITHOUT ANY- INFORMATION AND THEY'RE GOING BACK INTO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE INFECTING FOLKS. THANK YOU. LOOK AT. WHAT I'M JUST GOING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS JUST BROKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. COUPLE OF MY COLLEAGUES BROUGHT UP THE MASK THE ISSUE. YOU KNOW WHEN WE STARTED GETTINGAN INFLUXOF PEOPLE SAYING THEY HAD P. P. YOU KNOW I COMMENDED YOU FOR CREATING THAT WEBSITE THAT PEOPLE COULD GO THROUGH AND BE VETTED- TO FIND. ACTORS AND WRITERS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE. THE RESTORATION THEIR OWN PROTOCOL AND I HAD PEOPLE CONTACTING MY OFFICE AND I JUST I SENT IN TO THAT WEBSITE WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL BUT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS ONE OFF ON YOUR OWN AND I WANT TO GO BACK BECAUSE I MENTIONED THIS IN THE APRIL TWENTIETH HEARING. IS THAT PART OF THE B. Y. DE. MA'AM WAS THAT THERE A QUIT THEY WERE THE FIRST ONES THERE QUICK MEMBERS ALREADY CERTIFIED BY THE FDA- SO IS THAT MEMO IN CORRECTED THEY OVERSELL. WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CURRY WITH CAL- YES AGAIN SO THERE'S TWO PARTS TO CERTIFICATION THERE'S THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION FDA AND THEN I OFF WHICH IS A DIFFERENT- CERTIFICATION THIS THIS TO THE END NINETY FIVE. PRODUCT THE RESPIRATOR AND THAT IS UNDER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SOUTH- SAID THE FDA- PART OF IT WAS AND WAS IN PLACE ALREADY- WITH THEIR FACTOR WITH THEIR PRODUCT THE PRODUCTION OF NYE OFSHE- CERTIFIED AND NINETY FIVE MASK WAS THE PIECE THAT WAS NOT YET IN PLACE WITH THE CONTACT THEIR WORKING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. FOLLOW UP AND WAITED DETAIL ANONYMOUS TECHNICAL PART- IF I AM NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THE SPECIFICS BUT- THAT'S THE- YOU KNOW KIND OF THE HIGH LEVEL. MAYBE I'M NOT A MEDICAL PERSON MAYBE YOU CAN JUST EXPLAIN TO MAY AND THE PUBLIC WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT AND NINETY FIVE AND A QUE AND NINETY FIVE. AND I AM I'M NOT A MEDICAL PERSON EITHER BUT TO THE CANE AND NINETY FIVE IS A PRODUCT THAT NORMALLY IS NOT USED IN THE YOU ASKED FOR- RESPIRATORS WORD AND NINETY FIVE IT IS THE CAN YOU LAST NIGHT HOURS THE FIRE. PRODUCT THERE WAS SOME EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR I DON'T I BELIEVE IN THE US EIGHT BY THE- FEDERAL REGULATORS YOU USE THAT K. F. NINETY FIVE. THE A STRANGE SITUATION. GENERALLY THAT'S MY ADDRESS IN AGAIN YOU KNOW WANT TO HEAR ABOUT ALL THE TECHNICAL WITH OUR OUR EXPERTS IN THIS AREA BUT THAT THE THAT'S AGAIN A HIGH LEVEL SO HOW MANY MASS DEALS WERE THERE WE'VE READ ABOUT THE WHITE DE THERE WAS A- DAIMLER COMPANY WAS A BLUE POINT OR SOMETHING THAT WAS THE ONE THAT WAS IN BUSINESS FOR THREE DAYS AND THE BANK NOTIFIED THE TREASURER. THE DOORS MISSION BUT HOW MANY HOW MANY DEALS ARE THEY- I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS WE HAVE POSTED ALL THE CONTRACTS ON OUR WEBSITE- THERE'S MOUSE BUT THERE'S A OTHER COMMODITIES IT BEEN PURCHASED. FOR THAT PANDEMIC BUT- YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE ORDERING IN QUANTITIES THAT WE COULD RECEIVE TO SOME OF THE- VENDORS WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE SMALL QUANTITIES OF CERTAIN THINGS. I'M NOT ONLY OTHER MASS AND NINETY FIVE SURGICAL BUT THERE'S ALSO FACE SHIELDS GOWNS- SANITIZERS YOU KNOW VERY VERY AS COMMODITIES THAT WERE NEEDED- IN MAY AND THE OB AT SCALE. THE AND THAT MAKES. THERE'S A VARIETY OF THOSE SAYS THEY ARE DIFFERENT SIZES THE REASON THERE ARE MULTIPLE IS BECAUSE WE WERE. TRYING TO REACH BOWLS OF QUANTITY AND WE'RE GETTING- DOES FEEL THAT WE COULD WHEN WE COULD SO HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT. THANKS I THINK TO THE WHOLE COMMITTEE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING. THE EXTENT OF THE DEALS. ABOUT WHAT WE'VE PAID. WHAT WE'VE GOTTEN IN PP AND WHERE YOU'VE SENT THAT WHETHER IT'S HOSPITALS OR FRONTLINE WORKERS OR FIREFIGHTERS OR DAYCARE COULD BE JUST THE PROCESS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO ME AND THE AND THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE- LET ME ASK YOU A- SO. IN THE TWENTIETH HEARING IT WAS TOLD TO US THAT YOU GUYS WERE FOLLOWING THE HOPKINS MODEL- FOR TRENDS THROUGH ALL THIS HAVE YOU GONE BACK AND TRIED TO- RE CALIBRATE ANY OF THESE TRENDS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME YOU KNOW THE MATT THING WAS A BIG DEAL IT FOR SENATE DIED DOWN NOW THE MASS THINGS A BIG DEAL AGAIN. AND IT WILL THEN. WE NEED ALL THESE VENTILATORS AND WE DIDN'T NEED THE VENTILATORS AND THE GOVERNOR LOANS AND OTHER STATES. AND THEN WE ARE GEARING UP FOR A FIFTY THOUSAND HOSPITAL BEDS THAT DIDN'T MATERIALIZE. ARE YOU GUYS WHAT WHAT IS YOUR STRATEGY GOING FORWARD AND WHO'S BUYING ON- FOR THESE NUMBERS. THE STUFF THAT WE- FOR THE PAST HASN'T REALLY ME BLOCKS. SO I'M GONNA OVER TO MARK. COLLEAGUE FROM HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WHO CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON MODELING AND WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. REMEMBER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION SO- LET ME BREAK UP THE QUESTION INTO A FEW DIFFERENT COMPONENTS FIRST AND FOREMOST- THE REASON WHY WE PUT THE STATE HOME ORDER CAME PLACES THE REASON WHY. WE DON'T SEE THE TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WITH REGARDS TO BOTH THE CASE POSITIVE ADD TO AND DOES IS BECAUSE WE TAKE ACTION- QUICKLY. AND THE STATE OR MORTAR AND THE ACTIONS OF THE GOVERNOR DID TWO THINGS THEY ALLOWED US TO BUY TIME IN ORDER TO DECOMPRESS OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND. MORE WE HAD A LOT. TO PREPARE AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE IS THAT PEOPLE REALLY DID HEED THE ADVICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND UP A WHOLE LOT OF ALL WITH REGARD TO STAYING AT HOME. OUT AT REALLY. WITH REGARD TO AT AMP. SURGE WE ARE VERY FOR. THAT WE DIDN'T AFTER ACTIVATE ANY TO OF ANSWER CAL. THAT NOT MEAN THAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE A SEARCH AS WE BEGIN MODIFICATIONS WITH REGARDS TO THE STAY AT HOME ORDER WOULD TERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS DRIVING OUR ABILITY TO TERM AND KIND OF WHAT THIS. WHAT THINGS OF HOW THINGS WILL LOOK LIKE WITH REGARDS TO THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AND ARE MARKED. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE DO NOT KNOW AT THE SEASONALITY OF THIS VIRUS WE MIGHT ASSUME THAT TEMPERATURES MIGHT THAT DUE DUE TO THE TEMPERATURE CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE VIRUS. WE BELIEVE. THERE IS SOME RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AT THE VIRUS DOES BEHAVE BASED ON TEMPERATURES BECAUSE OF ONE COMPONENT OF THE- CORONAVIRUS WHICH IS A AT THE COMMON COLD. BEHAVE THAT WAY NOW- WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS WILL BEHAVE THAT WAY. OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AS WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT- THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE STATE HOME ORDERED A POTENTIAL SEARCH EITHER IN THE FALL OR IN THE COMING WEEKS. IS HOW INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR MIGHT CHANGE. AS WE MAKE THESE MODIFICATIONS HOW WOULD YOU ONE NIGHT AND OUR OTHER CALIFORNIANS REACT AND HOW THEY ACT IN THE PUBLIC. EYE WHEN WE MAKE THESE MODIFICATIONS MORE IMPORTANTLY. PART PART AND OTHER MUSICIANS IN THE COMMUNITY OF WHAT PRECAUTIONS THEY TAKE. A NAP COUPLE. MAKE THE- ASIAN WE MIGHT HAVE SAID THOSE ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO. THANK YOU. WE. THANK YOU ON TOP WE ALSO USE THE NUMBER OTHER MODELS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE FORTY I THINK NOW IS THAT WE SOME ACT DATE AROUND THE BEHAVIOR OF THE VIRUS IN COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE USING THAT ACTUAL DATA TO REALLY DRIVE OUR DECISION MAKING. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LOOKING AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PROJECTIONS WITH REGARDS TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE FIRE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MARK GOING TO PLEASE DON'T TAKE MY QUESTION IS CRITICAL WERE ALL INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORIES AND HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW AS WE'RE SITTING HERE NOW IT I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE SOME LEAN BUDGET YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE QUESTIONS OF THE MASS COME UP. I MEAN WE'RE GONNA BE TIGHT FOR DOLLARS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. WE'RE SPENDING THOSE WISELY ON THINGS WE ACTUALLY NEED SO THANKS FOR THAT MIGHT MY FINAL QUESTION IS FOR FINANCE. AND GOING BACK TO THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIRS COMMENTS ABOUT. THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT I JUST WANNA. WHY DO YOU WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED THAT YOU WANT TO BE THE- DECISION MAKER OF. OF ALLOCATING THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT MAY COME IN. ON THAT QUESTION WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS I THINK- WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO A SPECIFIC- FLEXIBILITY THAT WE ARE REQUESTING. WHEN IT COMES TO- EMERGENCY AUTHORITY AND YOU KNOW WE ARE I'VE BEEN AN EMERGENCY- SINCE THE GOVERNOR AND MADE HIS DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY AND I THINK WHAT THIS VIRUS- MY COLLEAGUE MARCO WAS DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENT MODELS AND- HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT BUT ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW. IS THAT THIS CAN CHANGE VERY QUICKLY AND WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THAT DIVERSITY OF OUT TIMES EVEN WITHIN THE UNITED STATES FROM STATE TO STATE AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MOVING VRY CAREFULLY AND DISCIPLINED WAY. COMES TO RE OPENING THE ECONOMY BUT WE'RE ALL OF US DID BY WHAT OTHER STATES IN THE US DO. AND WE'RE ALSO AFFECTED BY UNKNOWNS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS VIRUS SO THE REASON THAT WE'RE REQUESTING THE FLEXIBILITY. IS SO THAT THE STATE CAN. IF YOU HAVE TO AND THAT SUMMER AND FALL. IN PER YEAR AWAY IF THE WATCHED. IS OUT OF SESSION OR OTHERWISE CANNOT ACT IN A VERY QUICK MANNER BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ENGAGEMENT- AND CLEAR NOTIFICATION AND WERE. CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES WHEN IT COMES TO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO PUT OUT THAT WHETHER WE KNOW CAME LATE LAST NIGHT. BUT DECLARE FIRE EXPENDITURES SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT. EVEN BEFORE THIS HEARING TODAY AS WELL AS HEADING INTO NEXT WEEK SO I KNOW WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET THE BALANCE RIGHT. BUT I THINK THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION- ALSO DO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME PROVISION IF THERE IS A RESURGENCE OR NEED TO STEP UP HOSPITALS ARE AGAIN. THAT WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT IS A CORE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IN AN EMERGENCY. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK FOR THE TIMES CHAIR. THANK YOU THE OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE I GET TO MY QUESTIONS AND JUST LOOK AT THE COMMITTEE. OKAY TO STORE A COUPLE COUPLE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS- JUST GOING BACK TO THIS MAY TWENTY FIRST LETTER. CAN YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH WHY THE- THEY NEED TO DO THIS- THE TRIO- ALLOCATION AT THIS POINT WHEN WE ARE. SORT OF ALL IN ALL IN SESSION WE'RE ALL HERE THERE WAS NO- NOTIFICATION THERE WAS NO HEADS UP THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION. SO JUST WALK US THROUGH THE THAT THAT THINKING. SURE LET ME- I'LL JUST MAKE THE ONE POINT THAT THIS IS FOR CURRENT YEAR EXPENDITURES BUT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING THE BROADER QUESTION ABOUT THE THINKING BEHIND IT AND LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO RECYCLE FOR. YES THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING WE EVER REALLY. TRIED TO. AND THIS LETTER NOT ONLY DESCRIBE THE CURRENT YEAR DOLLARS FOR THE JURY ALLOCATION. BUT ALSO LAY OUT THE PLAN AS IT IS REFLECTED IN THE REVISION AND ARMING REVISION FIGURES. SAID THE DRILL ALLOCATION FOR THE SKI SAYS ON THE ONE TWENTY THREE BILLION. THREE ONE BILLION DOLLARS. REALLY REFLECTS THINGS AGAIN THAT ARE. KIND OF UNDER WAY IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND EXPECTED. AND FOR THE REMAINING WEEKS OF THE CURRENT YEAR. AB THERE ARE AS AS WAS NOTED EARLIER VARIOUS CATEGORIES BUT WE REALLY DID TRY TO LAY OUT. NOT ONLY THE CURRENT YOUR PART BUT ALSO TO GIVE FURTHER DETAIL ON THE MAY REVISION. OF ASSUMPTIONS AND SO THAT WAS THE GOAL OF THIS LETTER WAS TO PROVIDE EVEN MORE DETAIL THAT WAS. THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE RIVER BUT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR MAIN REVISION ESTIMATES. NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT DISEASE CAN YOU JUST ME THROUGH WHAT WHY THERE WAS NO. LEGISLATIVE BRIEFING THERE WAS NO- IT'LL IT'S IT WAS THAT WE WERE DIFFICULT TO REACH WERE WE UNAVAILABLE. PERHAPS YOU WERE BUSY. YES MISTER KING I THINK- WE WERE- FINALIZING AT TWO BECAUSE THE SITUATION IS CHANGING ON A DAILY BASIS- THIS WAS PART OF UPDATING OUR ESTIMATES FOR THE NAY REVISION AND CLARIFYING THEM AND PUTTING THEM INTO A FORMAT THAT WE COULD SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND SO WE- AND I CAN CONFIRM THIS WE DID NOT FINALIZE WHAT WE SHARED- LAST NIGHT AND TOLD VERY SHORTLY- BEFORE WE DID SHARE IT- WE HAD A CALL. WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF OUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY- SHARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN WALK THEM THROUGH- SOME OF THE KEY PROVISIONS SO WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO. IMPROVE AT AND FOR THE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION BUT WE DID SHARE THAT AS SOON AS IT WAS READY. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A POINT AND- MY COLLEAGUES TO CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG- BLOODLUST CHECKED IT CONSTITUTION LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO SUBSTITUTE IT JUST TORE. SO ARE. BIG DIFFERENCE TELLING ME SOMETHING PERSIST HAULING MY STAFF SOMETHING. SO THERE WAS NO CALIFORNIA AND THAT ELECTED ANY ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS LAST I CHECKED. SO AGAIN YOU HAVE CURRENT YOUR REVISIONS AND RATHER THAN CALL US HOW THE MEETING DISCUSS IT WITH US YOU SENT A FORMAL LETTER. IS THIS THE CAN IS THIS THIS IS THE PATTERN THAT YOU CONTINUE TO. ANTICIPATE ACTING DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS PANDEMICS GONNA GO FOR COULD BE. TWO THREE YEARS. WE COULD BE LIVING AGAIN IN A POST COVERT NINETEEN PERIOD FOREVER. AS ALL THE MEDICAL DOCTORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THERE'S THIS DISEASE IS NOT GOING AWAY. SO IS THIS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO CONTINUE OPERATE. DURING THIS COVER NINETY WHICH COULD BE FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD OF THIS ADMINISTRATION'S EXISTENCE. I THINK WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SHARE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE CAN AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND- AND I KNOW WE WERE WORKING ON FINALIZING THIS INFORMATION ON WHICH HAS BEEN UPDATED SINCE WE WERE ALL TOGETHER LAST MONTH WHEN WE INITIALLY PROJECTED A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR EXPENDITURE- BUT I HEAR YOUR FEEDBACK MISTER TECH AND I'LL MAKE SURE TO SHARE IT WITH. A MENTAL IMAGES CLEAR BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS DISCUSSION WITH MY STAFFAS WELL JUST BECAUSE YOU HIT SEND. IN AN EMAIL. THE ACCOUNT HAS INFORMING ME. SO YOUR IDEA OF COMMUNICATION IS SENDING ME A FORM LETTER VIA EMAIL. THAT'S NOT COMMUNICATION I HOPE THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS IT'S DEFINITELY NOT HOW WE ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS OTHERWISE WE'D ALL BE FIRED. SO SENDING A LETTER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE COMMUNICATION. SO AGAIN. THIS PANDEMIC JUST LIKE I OUTLINED JUST LIKE WE HAVE HEART DISEASE JUST LIKE WE HAVE CANCER WILL BE PROBABLY BE HERE FOR THE NEXT. SIX PLUS YEARS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION'S EXISTENCE SHOULD THIS. TO THE GOVERNOR AND I JUST PITIFULLY WILL BE REELECTED. IS THIS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION. PLANS TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A COVERT NINETEEN. BECAUSE NOTHING THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD EITHER IN THE LETTER WHEN THE MAY REVISE OR IN YOUR COMMUNICATION HAS. PUT FORWARD THAT WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE OUR- PRACTICES WE GET A LOT OF WE HEAR YOU BUT I'LL JUST SAY EVEN AS OF LAST WEEK. ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS REFUSED TO MEET WITH ME. I WAS I HAD A GROUP MEETING REQUEST WHICH WAS TURNED DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE TOO BUSY. AND I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS A BUSINESS PERSON THIS BILL. SO COULD YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SPECIFIC MEETING REQUESTS I WILL MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT NUMBER DURING THE MEETING BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS IS TAKING CARE OF. IS THIS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO OPERATE. DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN PERIOD WHICH COULD LAST FOR THE NEXT SIX PLUS YEARS. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THAT WHAT IT WAS YESTERDAY ANSWER. BUT WE ARE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO IMPROVE- AND SEE THE BEST WAY TO MAKE IT WITH YOU I WILL SAY THAT- THE LETTER THAT WE SENT YESTERDAY I GOT AN ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT THAT. A LETTER IS NOT FULL COMMUNICATION BUT WE WORK VERY HARD TO STRUCTURE A TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE TO SHARE- WAS IN THAT WRITER LETTER BUT I UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M GONNA MAKE SURE TO SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. DEPRECIATE THAT SO WITH AGAIN WE HAVE A PANDEMIC. THAT. TOUCHES EVERY CALIFORNIA TOUCHES EVERY PART OF THE STATE. SO I THINK WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS. LATER LIMITATIONS TO PARAMETERS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AUTHORITY TO SPEND FEDERAL FUNDING ESPECIALLY FOR FUNDING THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED FROM FEVER THERE THERE WAS- A NUMBER OF NOT A NUMBER BUT THEY WERE DEFINITELY EXPENDITURES DURING THIS PERIOD WHICH- WERE NOT. REIMBURSED BY FEMA. BUT WORK IN MY OPINION REGULAR BUDGET EXPENDITURES YET THE LEGISLATURE WAS NOT CONSULTED- WAS NOT ADVISE SO WHAT WHAT I SAY THE LEGISLATURE TO DOESN'T MEAN THAT. A LEGISLATING FOR WAS NOT TALK TO. WE HAVE A PROCESS WE HAVE A LEADERSHIP PROCESS WE HAVE A COMMITTEE PROCESS SO TALKING TO ALL ONE LEGISLATOR TALKING TO LEGISLATORS DOES NOT IN MY OPINION CONSTITUTE. ALSO TATIAN THERE WE HAVE A SPECIFIC PROCESS OF OUR CONSULTATION. MEANS THROUGH OUR GOVERNMENTAL HISTORY. SO YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO SEE IS- A LOT MORE SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF. WHAT YOU NEED- AUTHORITY FOR. BECAUSE THE WAY THIS- EMERGENCY SPECIFIED YOU COULD SPEND MONEY ON ANYTHING TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AND JUSTIFY THAT IT HAS AN IMPACT ON ANY NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHICH AGAIN THE STATE EMERGENCY COULD LAST FOR SIX YEARS OR MORE. CITY YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU COULD ELIMINATE BECAUSE OF THE TO NARROW THE EXPENDITURES BECAUSE ALL I'LL SAY THIS WHEN WE- THE BILL I BELIEVE ON MARCH SIXTEENTH WHEN WE LEFT THE IDEAL WAS. AND THE WAY THAT IT WAS PROPOSED TO US. WITH THAT THE EXPENDITURES WERE GOING TO BE LIMITED TO AGAIN YEAH HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY SO IN OUR MINDS IT WAS YOU KNOW PP. HOSPITAL ROOMS. YOU KNOW PEOPLE FIVE GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREET. SO AGAIN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING OUR PROPER OVERSIGHT OVER SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS DISPUTING THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR NEEDED TO TAKE A CREDIBLE LEADERSHIP THAT WE ASK. YOU KNOW WE- ARE NEED NEEDED TO GO AFTER PP AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING CHALLENGING TIMES AND NO ONE'S. NOT NO WONDER SIR CORRECTING THAT ISSUE- FOR THE GOVERNOR DID MADE IT YOU KNOW I THINK EVERYTHING HE DID I PERSONALLY AGREE WITH. THE PROCESS IN WHICH IT WAS DONE. I THINK WAS VERY CONCERNING. SO AGAIN AGAIN KNOWING THAT WE MAY BE IN THIS STATE FOR A WHILE. IT CAN NOW- COVE IN NINETEEN. SITUATION IS TO ME BECOMING MORE SIMILAR TO. HEART DISEASE AND CANCER WHICH ARE ALSO A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH. WHAT WHAT THINKING HAS BEEN DONE TO. PERHAPS PROPOSED OR TO CREATE A GREATER SCOPE LIMITATION. YEAH I'LL MAKE TWO POINTS- ON THAT AND HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY FOLLOW UP SERVE THEIR PARTS OF THE QUESTION THAT I DIDN'T GET TO SUFFICIENT WEIGHT I THINK THE FIRST IS THAT WE VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITH THE NEIGHBOR VISION AND HEADING INTO THIS ONE NOT TO WEAR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FINALIZE THE BUDGET WE KNOW THAT THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE- BUT WE THOUGHT IT'S IMPORTANT- GIVING AT THAT PRIVACY OF THE BUDGET PROCESS- THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE EXPECTED THAT GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE TO BE- THAT THAT CAN BE DISCUSSED AND DEBATED THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS INCLUDING HEARINGS LIKE THIS AND SO THAT'S WHY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING UP TO THE MAYOR AND THEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL USED TO CLARIFY AS BEST WE CAN THOSE EXPENDITURES THE SECOND POINT IS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS EXPENDITURES IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS COMING YEAR- I THINK WE- BELIEVE THAT THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HOPING THAT TRENDS WILL CONTINUE- WHERE THERE WON'T BE A RESURGENCE LIKE- LIKE YOU SOME PEOPLE FEAR THAT THESE THINGS CAN WORK THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS EXCEPT THAT THESE EXPENDITURES ARE PREDICTABLE AND I KNOW MISTER CHAIR YOU MADE AND IT'S ALL DUE TO HEART DISEASE. OR CANCER AND OF COURSE- AT ALL NOW- THESE ARE CHANGING ALL SORTS OF WAYS BUT I IMAGINE THAT I WANT TO SPEAK TOO FAR OUT OF TURN THAT THERE IS A SOMEWHAT PREDICTABLE PATH IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND NOT NECESSARILY A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE AT VARIANCE WITH COLBERT NINETEEN THE TRUTH IS I THINK THAT PREDICTABILITY- IS NOT KNOWN YET BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE VIRUSES ON DOWN SO YOU CAN HAVE ONE TEN THE DEBTS OF COVERT NINETEEN NEXT YEAR THAT WE HAVE THIS YEAR YOU COULD HAVE TEN TIMES THAT NUMBER NEXT YEAR COMPARED TO YOURS AND SO THAT. WERE WORRIED ABOUT THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US UP AT NIGHT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THAT AT BROUGH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OF COURSE THEN THERE ISN'T A NEED TO RESORT TO ADD EXTRA FINDING OUT BEYOND- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING. AT A PROPOSED IN JUST BY. AND THE ONLY. THAT WE HAVE BEEN TO. SEX LANGUAGES AN EMERGENCY PROVISION. ARE INDEED. THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE VERY FOR. TO GET AHEAD OF A RESURGENCE OF THIS CASE BUT CERTAINLY- NOBODY MORE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S SHARES THIS GOAL WITH YOU. UP WE WANT THIS EMERGENCY TO GO AWAY I JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO AND SO I KNOW WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. NO WE DEFINITELY. LOOK THE GOOD THE GOVERNOR COULD CALL. A COVERT NINETEEN SPECIAL SESSION- THROUGH THE FALL HE HAS THAT AUTHORITY. HE IS THE AUTHORITY TO BRING US BACK OR **** TO COME BACK WHATEVER. HI HE'S A WHICH IS NOT ON THINK THERE'S ANYBODY HERE- OR ANY OF THE ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT I'VE HEARD THAT HAVE BEEN. RETICENT TO. AGAIN SERVE THEIR DUTY WHEN CALLED UPON- HAVING SAID THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF. CONCERN REGARDING THE- BLANKET AUTHORITY THAT IS BEING ASKED ABOUT- AND I AND I DO- I WOULD. ARGUE AGAIN- IF YOU TALK TO THE DOCTORS. THIS IS A CORONAVIRUS CORONAVIRUSES HAD BEEN VERY PREVALENT THROUGHOUT- FOR QUITE AWHILE AGAIN THE SIZE OF THE CRIME VIRUS AND THE- TRANSMISSION IS VERY DIFFERENT AND ALSO THE IMPACT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON PEOPLE. BUT MY ESTIMATION JUST LIKE WITH ANYTHING ELSE IS THAT- WE WILL BE WE NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS FOR A FEW MONTHS- WE CAN ANTICIPATE I WOULD SAY ABOUT DOING. IN TERMS OF VENTILATORS PP E. HOSPITAL ROOMS HOW WE MANAGE THE HOMELESS- I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT ALL THE SUN- WE'RE GONNA BE GOING THROUGH A HUGE DEVIATION OF THIS OBVIOUSLY- AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DISEASE THERE THERE WILL BE CHANGES THERE THIS THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE- BUT I GUESS THE WAY THE BLANKET AUTHORITY WORKS IS THAT. AND YOU KNOW ANY ANYTHING CAN BE DONE WHENEVER ANYBODY FEELS LIKE IT AND THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE TO EVEN GET LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL THEY JUST NEED YOUR VACATION AND AGAIN NOTIFICATION COULD JUST BE I JUST HIT SEND ON THE EMAIL BUTTON. SO AGAIN JUST GOING BACK TO MY FIRST POINT IN THE QUESTION THAT YOU DIDN'T ANSWER WHICH WAS- ON. IT IN ORDER FOR THIS. TO CONTINUE TO WORK THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SIGNIFICANT PROCESS CHANGES OF WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD EITHER IN THE REVISION. OR IDEAS BUT THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE. ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FORWARD THE OTHER CONCERNING THING IS THE LITTERING OF CONTROL SECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET. MANY OF WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH. THE PANDEMIC I JUST HAVE ONE EXAMPLE AROUND THE GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTION FUND SO WHY WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SECTIONS OF THE BUDGET THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH COVERED NINETEEN. WELL WHY IS THERE ARE BEEN THIS DESIRE TO PUT IN ALL THESE CONTROL CONTROL. SECTIONS TO HAMPER FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS HAMPER FUTURE LEGISLATORS FROM MAKING. BUDGET DECISIONS AND IF YOU COULD IF YOU COULD SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THAT ONE FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT JUST ALSO TALK ABOUT THE- THE DESIRE TO HAVE- CONTROL SECTIONS ALL OVER THE BUDGET. YES SO I'LL SPEAK TO THE BROADER QUESTION AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FINE I THINK THE REASON FOR THESE ADDITIONAL CONTROL SECTIONS. NUMBER ONE SOME OF THEM RELATE TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING AND SPENDING BUT I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT CATEGORIES NUMBER TWO A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS- ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND WE KNOW WE ARE PROPOSING THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO. MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS- BUT THE TRUTH IS AND THIS IS A TRUE ACROSS THE BUDGET THAT BE REVENUE TO SUSTAIN THOSE INVESTMENTS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN EVERY YEAR BUT THIS YEAR MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN THAN MOST AND WHILE YOU KNOW. WE MAKE OUR PROJECTIONS IT'S HARD TO MAKE PREDICTIONS BUT THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THAT CAP AND TRADE REVENUE- THAT FINDS THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS FIND WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER- THIS COMING YEAR ND WE PROJECTED BACK IN JANUARY AND SO THE CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE. IS A PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OUT HOW TO GOVERN THE USE OF FUNDS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE REVENUE COMES IN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED BEFORE I THINK THE ONE THING I'LL SAY. IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FUTURE LEGISLATORS FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS HI THIS CONTROL SECTION IS OUR PROPOSAL ON IT IS IN STATUTES AND IF CONDITIONS CHANGE WE DO OUR BEST TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT WITHIN THE CONTROL SECTION IS ITSELF BUT OF COURSE HAPPY TO. TAKE ANY FEEDBACK ON HOW TO IMPROVE THOSE BUT THOSE CONTROLS ACTIONS CAN ALSO BE MODIFIED BY A TEACHER OR EVEN THE CURRENT LEGISLATURE BUT ON THE SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU RAISED. LET ME TURN IT OVER TO THERESA. HELLO ON THAT THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION BY AND CONTROL SECTION. IF YOU HAVE SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS PROPOSED- BUT IT IS AN EXISTING CONTROL SECTION THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THAT DOES PERTAIN TO THE EXPENDITURE AND COMMITMENT OF- CAP AND TRADE FUNDING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. YEAH BUT WE ARE TRYING TO BE REALLY EXPLICIT AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO REALLY BE VERY EXPLICIT ABOUT THE MECHANISM. THAT WE PROPOSE TO USE- ONCE WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT THAT. OPTION PROCEEDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING IN THROUGH THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. WELL I AGREE WITH YOU I HAVE SUBSTANTIAL AMENDMENTS PROPOSED AS WELL. I DON'T KNOW THE WILL BE AGREEING ON THEM SO JUST GOING BACK TO THE MISTER VS ONE NATHAN- AGAIN ON THE ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT A BUDGET IS WE'RE GONNA BE WRONG DOESN'T CHANGE EVERY SINGLE YEAR WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WE'RE WE'RE GONNA OVER ALLOCATE WITHIN IS WE'RE GONNA UNDER ALLOCATE. THAT I DON'T THINK THAT'S- CHANGED. FROM BEFORE WAS BUDGETARY NOT GONNA CHANGE AFTER BEEN BUT IT SURE THAT'S THAT'S THE BUDGET PROCESS A BUDGET IS. OUR BEST GAS- TO. ABOUT BEST GUEST OF EXPENDITURES BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY YOU SEE THE NEED TO- BASICALLY CUT OUT THE PUBLIC CUT OUT THE LEGISLATURE FROM THAT FUTURE DELIBERATION AND I'VE ALSO SEE HERE'S HERE'S THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS IN YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS HAPPEN IN PRIVATE IN YOUR OFFICE. OUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS HAPPENED HERE IN COMMITTEE IN PUBLIC IN PUBLIC VIEW OF WHAT PUBLIC COMMENT WITH PUBLIC FEEDBACK. IT AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED. RIGHT I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB AND WE'RE DOING OUR JOB. BUT FOR FREE YOU TAT NOT GET. PUBLIC FEEDBACK NOT GET LEGISLATIVE. FEEDBACK FOR THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND FOR THOSE TO BE HAPPENING. OUT OF SIGHT I THINK IS. VERY TROUBLING AND VERY CONCERNING I THINK- I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW IN DEPTH THE GOVERNOR WAS BRIEF BUT- I DON'T KNOW THAT HE WOULD AGREE WITH IT JUST BECAUSE- LIKE I SAID BEFORE ON APRIL TWENTIETH I THINK. YOU KNOW YOUR OUR GOVERNOR IS WHAT PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHAMPION OF TRANSPARENCY. THAT I KNOW I MEAN HIS WHOLE CAREER HAS BEEN. FOCUSED ON PROVIDING MORE OPENNESS MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE DATA MORE INFORMATION SO THE FACT THAT. YOUR YOUR TRYING TO ANTICIPATE SCENARIOS AND ANTICIPATE ADJUSTMENTS FOR SCENARIOS WHICH MAY HAPPEN. MAY NOT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE IS VERY AN ORTHODOX BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A BUDGET PROCESS- WALL WE EVEN MY WHEN THEY ARE BEING RECESSED THE GOVERNOR CAN CALL AN EXTRAORDINARY SESSION. WE'RE NOT IN RECESS WE CAN COME BACK IN JANUARY MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET THAT IS NECESSARY. SO TO ME THESE CONTROL SECTIONS ESPECIALLY THAT AREN'T SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO THE- EMERGENCY SEEM. VERY MUCH OUT OF PLACE AND A HUGE OVERREACH OF AUTHORITY I THINK I THINK THE L. L. AND I FORGOT TO READ THE LA DOES- QUOTE EARLIER. IS THAT THE I WILL SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD GUARD ITS CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN THE FORTIES IS NOT SO MUCH A- AGAIN. IT'S NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE EXPENDITURE I THINK IT IS THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN SET UP SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR FEEDBACK THE LEGISLATURE CAN OPPORTUNITY FOR FEEDBACK WE DON'T HAVE A BUDGET WITH- FIFTY THOUSAND CONTROL SECTIONS BECAUSE MAYBE HIGHER READ FUNDING CAME IN LAST OR YOU KNOW CHILD CARE FUNDING CAME IN MORE FOR HEALTH CARE- ALL THIS AND YOU KNOW WE HAD MORE MEDI CAL OR CAL WORKS- ENROLLMENT THAN WE ANTICIPATED. THAT IS THE BUDGET THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW IF WE WERE GOING TO BE RIGHT ON THE MONEY WE STILL BE IN VEGAS NOT HERE. SO AGAIN. THIS IS VERY CONCERNING ESPECIALLY. GIVEN THAT YOUR AGENCY. HAS SHOWN A DISDAIN TO PROPERLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN I SAY THE LEGISLATURE I MEAN LEGISLATE COURSE. SO AGAIN LET YOU YOU CAN TALK TO ALL THE STAFF YOU WALKED. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT COMMUNICATING WITH ME OR MY COLLEAGUES. THAT'S SUCH A WORD THE LEGISLATURE. SO AGAIN THE THERE WILL NEED TO BE I THINK- VERY SERIOUS DISCUSSION OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- IN ORDER TO REALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I KNOW THAT- IN EVERY LEGISLATOR THAT I'VE TALKED TO THERE IS A- SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CONCERN. REGARDING THE FUTURE OF THIS PROCESS. HAVINGSAID THAT I THINK THERE'S ALSO HE- HUGE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE WANT THE GOVERNOR TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE WANT THE STATE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE BUT WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT. WE SHOULD- IGNORE THE LEGISLATURE OR IGNORE THE PUBLIC. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS SINCE THE JUST TO SORT OF SUMMARIZE I THINK WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IS A- SIGNIFICANT. DEFINITION OF SCOPE BECAUSE AGAIN IT MOST EMERGENCY IF YOU HAVE A GEOGRAPHIC DEFINITION AND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM DEFINITIONS. SO TO SAY IT ALL I GUESS WITH THE WILD FAR YOU COULD YOU COULD SAY ALL THESE THINGS COULD HAPPEN OR COULD NOT HAPPEN. BUT IN GENERAL THERE'S A VERY SPECIFIC SCOPE IT THAT'S SEEN AS REASONABLE WITH THE WITH THIS PANDEMIC WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS STRETCH THE SCOPE. TO DO ANYTHING. SO I THINK THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT REALLY NEEDS TO HUDDLE WITH ALL THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO REALLY HAVE MUCH BETTER SCOPE DEFINITION AS TO WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW YOU INTEND TO SOLVE IT I THINK AGAIN. ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE MADE IN MID STREAM I DON'T THINK- WILL WILL BE PASSED ON MARCH SIXTEENTH- BUDGET BILL THAT WAS DONE. I THINK IN A FEW YOU KNOW IN IN IN A DAY OR TWO BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK WE- WE DEMONSTRATED OUR ABILITY. TO ACT VERY VERY QUICKLY- I WANTED TO GO BACK FOR A SECOND. TO INSTITUTIONALLY ONE INSTITUTIONS THE DOCTOR WEBER MENTION BUT ALSO THE OTHER INSTITUTION OF- NURSING HOMES. SO TO ME. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BOTH THE ACTION OR THE- NOT NOT ENOUGH ACTION TAKING PLACE IN BOTH THE NURSING HOME SETTING BUT ALSO IN THE- CORRECTIONS FACILITIES THE PRISON SETTING. BECAUSE IN BOTH OF THOSE SITUATIONS YOU HAVE POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT AMPLE TORY MEANING THEY'RE NOT GOING OUT THE PUBLIC THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SHOP AT THE GROCERY STORE THEY'RE NOT LEAVING THE FACILITY. THE PEOPLE BRINGING IN THE DISEASE ARE ALL THE EMPLOYEES. AND I'M NOT BLAMING THE EMPLOYEES I'M JUST THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST A FACT- YET THERE HASN'T BEEN IN MY OPINION- ENOUGH ACTION TAKEN ESPECIALLY ON THE- CDC OUR SITE I WAS I WAS PLEASED IN IN A BRIEFING JUST THINK WAS YESTERDAY. THAT THERE WAS MORE. ACTION TAKEN ON THE NURSING HOME SIDE BUT- BUT. IT WAS STILL KIND OF BEING PLANNED IT WAS NOT- IT WAS NOT A FIRM. AB EXECUTION YET SO BOTH IN TERMS OF CORRECTIONS AS WELL AS A WITH NURSING HOMES HOW FAST IS THE ADMINISTRATION PLANNING TO ACT. TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PROPER TESTING AND EVALUATION OF EMPLOYEES AS THEY GO IN AND OUT AND LET LET SOMEONE NURSING HOMES BECAUSE MYSELF A COUPLE THAT LEGISLATORS GOT BRIEF BUT THIS THIS SPECIALLY WITH. WITH OUR PRISON SYSTEM. ALL OF THE PRESENT SYSTEM I KNOW THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO BOTH THE LAY OUT OF THESE FACILITIES IN USE OF COMMON SPACES- TO IMPROVE SOCIAL DISTANCING- AS WELL. THANKS THOSE ARE TOP OF MIND I DO NOT HAVE A THERE ARE COLLEAGUES IDEA LAUGHS WE SPECIALIZE IN THOSE ISSUES WITH ME- SO I WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT MISTER CHAIR. THAT THAT'S FINE I THINK I THINK JUST TO JUST TO TAKE THE POINT HOME IS- AGAIN WE WANT TO FOR THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE SAFETY OF THE INMATES AND ALSO AS WELL AS FOR THE NURSING HOME. RESIDENTS WE NEED TO ESURE THAT THIS PROPER TESTING. OF EMPLOYEES THERE HAS TO BE REGULAR TESTING- THERE HAS TO BE PROPER SAFETY. PROTOCOLS FOR EACH OF THOSE. PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE ONCE WE'VE SEEN ONCE- ONCE COVERT NINETEEN AND THE BANANAS TUITION COULD SPREADS. LIKE WILDFIRE FOR LACK OF A BETTER ANALOGY. NURSING HOME TELL US YOUR NURSING HOME POSITIVE TESTS ARE ONLY 3% ARE ONLY 3% OF CORPORATE POSITIVE TESTS. BUT YET THEY ARE 25% OF DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. SO THE STAKES ARE ARE FAIRLY HIGH FOR EACH OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS AND AGAIN IN NEITHER OF THESE RESIDENTS ARE EMPLOYED TOWARD THE CAT THE CAT MOVE AND MOVING THEM IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT. SO I THINK I CAN YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN. ASSIST ON ALL THOSE ALL THOSE INSTITUTIONS MOVING FORWARD. OKAY I'M NOT SEEING ANY MORE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE- WE ARE GOING TO GO TO A PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU CANNOT FIND THE BOOTH- IT IS NEAR THE NORTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL BY THE NORTH ENTRANCE TO THE CAPITAL AND ELEVENTH AND L. STREET. WE KNOW WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE THERE ARE GOING TO LOOK TO THE PUBLIC ANY PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN THE ROOM.
