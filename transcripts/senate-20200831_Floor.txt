TEN SIXTY SIX CODIFIES THE TEN DAY DEADLINE FOR EMPLOYERS RESPOND TO ET'S INITIAL NOTICE UNLESS THERE'S A GOOD CAUSE FOR DELAY.

WE DON'T HAVE YOU UP. I AM. ALL RIGHT WOULD YOU CHECK TO SEE BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I RECOGNIZE YOU IN THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW THERE WE GO THERE WE GO ALL RIGHT OKAY AND I'M SORRY THESE ARE A PROBLEM. THE JOINT TECHNOLOGY NOT TO WORRY ALL RIGHT HELLO PLEASE PROCEED. SO MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL- TEN SIXTY SIX I FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T UNDERSTAND. WHY WE CONTINUE TO REGULATE PRIVATE BUSINESS OUT OF THE POINT OF NO RETURN. TO THINK THAT THE DELAYS AND THE NON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EDT PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT REQUIRES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DISTRIBUTE THESE BENEFITS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS LIKE THE TO STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE OBLIGATION TO DISTRIBUTE EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THOSE FUNDS TO THE UNEMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATE THAT DESPERATELY NEED THESE RESOURCES. THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PAY THESE BENEFITS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. EDT DEPARTMENT IS A COMPLETE DISASTER AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN AUDIT AFTER AUDIT THERE'S ALSO BEEN- A TASK FORCE IT'S A SET FORTH BY THE GOVERNOR. INSTEAD THINK THAT- IT'S THE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE DELAYED YES IT'S NOT AND TO THINK THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THE DELAY IN BENEFITS BEING PAID WE'RE NOT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS EMPLOYERS- TO FILE QUARTERLY TAXES IMPAIR EDG. I'M SO YOU GET IT IN ADVANCE IN ADVANCE- BY THREE YEARS. SO DID THINK THAT- THERE'S IT'S THE WAY IT WORKS IS THERE'S A DELAY SO EMPLOYEES WORK AND FOR THAT CREATIVE TRYING TO WORK THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE EMPLOYER PAYS ET DE BENEFITS THAT WERE FOR THAT PREVIOUS YEAR. AND IT TAKES A YEAR AND NINE MONTHS LATER FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES TO BE ABLE TO DRAW ON THOSE BENEFITS SO YOU ALREADY GET EMPLOYER MONEY IN ADVANCE YOU CAN CLEAR MONEY IN ADVANCE AND THEN YOU BLAME IT ON THE EMPLOYERS. FOR NOT RESPONDING QUICK ENOUGH AND- IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS AND CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING DELAYS IN RECEIVING BENEFITS. THE PROBLEMS LIE WITH THE IN APP AND IN ANTIQUATED EDT YOUR EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. EDT MAY CLAIM THESE DEFICIENCIES ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF OUR STATE- HISTORICAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BUT THESE PROBLEMS WITH THE EDT OFFICE BLAMING IT ON. AND THE PANDEMIC- TOO MANY PEOPLE FILING FOR AN EMPLOY. YOU KNOW. POINTING AT IT ELSE BUT NO WILL TAKE ACCOUNT THAT INTO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE HAD IN OUR- AT THE AGENCY FOR TO THE- AND TWO. TWO TWO ELEVEN AND THIS THE DEPARTMENT FAILED TO MEET ANY ACCEPTABLE LEVELS. THAT WERE SET BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LATER LABOR AS EASY LABOR. AND IT ALSO. HAD A LONG. LIST OF THIS AUDIT HAD LONG TERM CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT WOULD BE- IMPROVED- TO IMPROVE ITS ABILITY TO DELIVERY TIMELY PAYMENTS NONE OF THOSE WERE IMPLEMENTED. THE EIGHTY TWO CONTINUES TO BE A VIOLATION OF THE R. F. P. P. WHICH IS THE FIRST PAYMENT PROMPTNESS. WHICH WAS WHAT I JUST ADDRESSED A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT WHEN YOU GET MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT MATCHES. OR PAYS A PERCENTAGE OF THE WHITE- FINDER THE EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT THESE PAYMENTS GO OUT WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. CALIFORNIA FAILED AND CONTINUES TO FAIL TO DO SO. AND THE DEPARTMENT SOLE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO DISTRIBUTE THE CENTRAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR OUR FAMILIES ADD THAT ARE OUT OF WORK. AND THEY CONTINUE TO FAIL TO DO SO TO THINK THAT- THAT AT. PASSING A LAW AND MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S THE EMPLOYERS- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYERS. INDEPENDENT JUST NO BURDENS ON EMPLOYERS I DO I BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY WHO OWES EDT PAYMENTS SHOULD PAY THEIR EIGHTY PAYMENTS. ABSOLUTELY BUT THIS BILL IS NOT THE SOLUTION- TO ANY PART OF THAT AND- YOU KNOW I REMIND YOU ALL THAT WE HAVE THE DOWNTURN- THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO I BELIEVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWELVE- WE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVERDREW THEIR EDT ACCOUNT AND THEN THEY JUST FAILED TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS IN THE IN THE- PLAYERS IN THE STATE HAD TO MAKE IT AT. IN MANY BUSINESSES WENT OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE YOU WOULD GET A BILL AT THE END OF THE YEAR FOR SIXTY THOUSAND EIGHTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND YOU'D HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THAT IN YOUR BUDGET. WITH MAYBE ONLY MAKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. BECAUSE YOU TO SEND YOU ALREADY YOUR- SO POINT 9% AND THEN MAKE BACK WITH IN ADDITION. PERCENTAGE TO PAY ADDITIONAL PERCENTAGE TO PAY ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT YOU ALREADY CONTRIBUTED TO THE WIFE AND ARGUE I TRUST FUND. THIS IS A COMPLETE MISMANAGEMENT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO COMPLETE MISMANAGEMENT BY THIS ADMINISTRATION AND PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS. GOING BACK ALL THE WAY TO TWO THOUSAND AND ONE EDT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. AND WE KNOW IT IT WAS ELEVATED. WE ALL I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT ONLY REPUBLICAN OFFICES GOT THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF CALLS. AND IN THEIR OFFICE TELLING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET BENEFITS ARTICLE AFTER ARTICLE IN THE SACRAMENTO BEE AND ALL OVER THE NEWSPAPERS. IN REPORTING WHERE PEOPLE HAD TO CALL- YOU KNOW SO AT TEN TWELVE FIFTEEN AND IN EVEN MORE TIMES TO EVEN GET A HUMAN PERSON TO RESPOND. WAITING WEEKS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS FOR PAYMENT. AND THE EIGHTY D. DEPARTMENT IS THAT IT IS A DISASTER IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. AND IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO FIX IT YOU WOULD ADDRESS THE SITUATION IS GOING ON WITH EDT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DELIVER THE PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE HURTING HAVE LOST THEIR JOB AND TO THINK THAT TIME. THIS BILL MAKES IT SOUND LIKE IT'S THE REASON WHY THE PAYMENTS ARE GOING OUT IS BECAUSE THE EMPLOYERS HAVEN'T PAID IT. AGAIN EMPLOYERS PAY IN ADVANCE IN ADVANCE EMPLOYERS PAY IN ADVANCE- SO THE MONEY IS PAID UP FRONT. IT'S THE MISMANAGEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH CAUSES THE DELAYED PAYMENTS TO NOT GO OUT TO INDIVIDUALS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. ANY. OTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE MEASURE. SEEING NON THANK YOU OF. SENATOR SHE SKINNER. THANK YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- AT TEN SIXTY SIX OF IMPACTS COMPANIES WITH FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES THAN WHO ARE HAVE NOT ARE NOT UP TO DATE IN THEIR EBT PAYMENTS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR ITEMS.

SENATE BILL TWO ZERO THREE BY SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO JUVENILES SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SB TWO OR THREE WOULD REQUIRE USE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN TO CONSULT WITH LEGAL COUNSEL PRIOR TO WALK WAIVING THEIR MIRANDA RIGHTS THIS BILL REQUIRE YOU TO WORK FACING INTERROGATION TO CONSULT. WITH AN ATTORNEY WHO EXPLAIN THEIR RIGHTS. AND WHAT IT MEANS TO WEAR THEM. WE KNOW FROM DECADES OF RESEARCH TO YOUNG PEOPLE AS WELL A ADULTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND THE CONSEQUENCES AWAITING THEM. COULD AND WAVING THEM COULD INFLICT ON THEIR LIVES AND WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF INNOCENT YOUTHS ESPECIALLY BLACK AND BROWN WE'VE BEEN PRESSURED INTO GIVING FALSE CONFESSIONS AND HIT THEIR LIVES DEVASTATINGLY IMPACTED BY THOSE CONSEQUENCES A PRIME EXAMPLE. IS THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE FIVE INNOCENT YOUNG MAN WHO SPENT YEARS IN PRISON FOR CRIMES THEY DID NOT COMMIT. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF EXONERATIONS SINCE CONFESSED THE CRIME. AND WERE LATER EXONERATED WERE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THIS BILL PROTECTS ALL CALIFORNIA YOU AND HELPS BUILD TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SOMETHING WE BADLY NEED RIGHT NOW. THIS LEGISLATURE PASSES BILL. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WHICH WAS S. B. TEN FIFTY TWO BY SENATOR LOREN SENATOR MITCHELL THIS MEASURE MEASURE WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THE LEGISLATURE PASS ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS BILL IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHICH WAS AMENDED THE YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. INCLUDED A SUNSET DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I REQUIRE THE PANEL TO BE CONVENE TO REVIEW THE FACTS THE CHANGE IN THE LAW. THE OPPOSITION THIS BILL ARGUES THAT WE SHOULD WAIT AND HEAR THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW. I SAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT. BUT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY KNOW. YOUNG PEOPLE MUST KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE ALONE WHEN BEING IN TERROR TERROR GATED I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOUNG SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO KILLED TWO PEOPLE AND WOUNDED ANOTHER ONE IN WISCONSIN WAS NOT IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW HE COMMITTED THE CRIME. WE KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IMPACTS YOUTH OF COLOR THE HARNESS. WHICH CAUSES THEM TO LOSE FAITH IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THIS BILL DOES NOT FOR BED INNOCENT TEEN FROM ENGAGING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IT WOULD MAKE. THEIR STATEMENTS AND MISCIBLE AND IT WOULD NOT PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING THEIR CONFESSIONS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR WORK. SB TWO OR THREE HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM LARGE COAL POLLUTION ORGANIZATIONS WHO RECOGNIZES THIS WILL CREATE GREATER TRUST ACCOUNTABILITY AND DUE PROCESS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS BILL IS ALSO SUPPORT OF A LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. MEMBERS THIS IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE. THAT PROTECTS. YOU FROM ANY SOONER IS THAT EVERYONE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED AND I STRONGLY AS FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD DEBATE OR DISCUSSIONS OR ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. ANY MIKE SUB. RIGHT WITH THAT WILL GO TO THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY AND WE DO HAVE A HAND UP BY SENATOR BORCHERS. PLEASE PROCEED SENATOR BORDERS THANK YOU. IF I MAY POSE A QUESTION THROUGH THE CHAIR TO THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SENATOR BRADFORD. YEAH PLEASE PROCEED. JUST A CLARIFICATION THE THAT CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION OF A JUVENILE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSULTATION WITH AN ATTORNEY SO THE RAISING OF THE AGE FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN- THESE INDIVIDUALS EITHER WRAPPED UP THE FINANCIAL WHERE WITH ALL TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY OR WITH THE HAVE A POINTED COUNSEL UNDER THE SITUATION HOW DOES THIS WORK WE HOPE IT WOULD HAVE APPOINTED IF THEY CAN AFFORD ATTORNEY WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ATTORNEY SO. THEY COULD REQUEST ONE. ALL RIGHT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE VOLUME IN WHETHER OR NOT OUR EXISTING APPOINTED- COUNCIL- ROSTER WHAT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR THIS JUST MORE PRACTICAL STANDPOINT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. I HAVE A THOUGHT ON THE FACT THAT. WHO ARE FOR MORE TIMES IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE INNOCENT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD AN ATTORNEY FOR THE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW ONLY ONE HANDED ARE TURNING NOW WITH SCOTT PETERSON SO I WOULD HOPE WE FIND A PRIORITY TO. MAKE ATTORNEYS AVAILABLE AT LEAST TALK TO THESE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE. DO YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION OF SENATOR MITCHELL. YOU SHOULD ASK THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO ZERO THREE I THINK IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF RESOURCES ARE WITH REGARD TO IF ATTORNEY IF WE HAVE TO AUGMENT PUBLIC COUNCIL I THINK THE ISSUE REALLY IS. TECHNOLOGY THE FACT THAT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AS THE AUTHOR SAID MOST ADULTS DON'T UNDERSTAND FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT IT MEANS TO CALL WAVE ONE'S RIGHTS AND SOUL THE SAME POPULATION OF SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN- IF THEY DIDN'T WAIVE THEIR RIGHT AND DEMANDED COUNCIL COUNCIL BE PROVIDED TO ALL THIS BILL IS SAYING IS. THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDED COUNSEL BEFORE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO WAIVE A RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE NEED OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF THEY ALREADY UNDERSTOOD THE PROCESS THEY WOULD ASK FOR COUNCIL ANYWAY AND COUNCIL WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVIDED I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO OR THREE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NON SENATOR I'M SORRY WE HAVE A- SENATOR GROWTH. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU ACCEPTTHE QUESTION FROM SENATOR GROWTH FIVE. PLEASE FISHING. THANK YOU MA'AM BUT THROUGH THE CHAIR THIS IS THE AUTHOR OF GOOD THE FLOOR JACQUI OF THE BILL MENTIONED THAT- OUT OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND AT LEAST TWENTY ONE PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW AND- ONLY ONE HAD AN ATTORNEY WAS SCOTT PETERSON. I AM LOOKING AT STATISTICS RIGHT NOW AND IT APPEARS TO ME THAT EVERYONE OF THEM HAD AN ATTORNEY- YOU KNOW DEATHROW I MEAN THEY WERE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY IN COURT SO I WHERE DID YOU GET THAT DATA SIR. PRIVATE ATTORNEYS THE REMOTES THE MORE COURT APPOINTED SCOTT PETERSON WAS THE ONLY ONE HERE LEGAL. OUR PRIVATE ATTORNEY WITH THE RESOURCES TO FIGHT A DIFFERENT CASE. AND EXCELLING IN YOUR STATEMENT THAT EVERY AT EVERY INMATE ON DEATH ROW AND ONLY ONE HAD A PRIVATE ATTORNEY. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS I READ THAT'S WHAT TWO YEARS AGO. THAT WAS THE CASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY THANK YOU ARE YOU WANTED YOU TO. THAT STATEMENT YOU. THANK YOU SO MELENDEZ. R. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I DON'T DISAGREE. WITH THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE RETURNED- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RESULTS OF WHAT THIS COMMISSION WAS SUPPOSED TO STUDY- BUT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE AND TAKE GREAT CARE OF THE KIDS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE AGREEING TO- AND WHAT THEY'RE BEING CHARGED WITH THE NOT A PARENT OR GUARDIAN SHOULD BE PRESENT ARE CERTAINLY SOME SORT OF LEGAL COUNSEL I'M SO FOR THOSE REASONS- I'M GOING TO BE ABSTAINING TODAY IN THE HOPES THAT- THIS COMMISSION COMES BACK WITH THE INFORMATION TO HELP PLACE- MAKE A DECISION THAT ARE AT A LATER DATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY CLOSE MMHM. I THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THIS DISCUSSION HERE THIS IS A SHRINK FOR MEASURE AS STATED THERE ARE ADULTS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO WAIVE ONE'S RIGHTS SO. LET'S NOT EXPECT ANYONE UNDER EIGHTEEN TO HAVE THAT MENTAL CAPACITY TRULY NO LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S MANY OF US HERE THAT DON'T. FULLY GRASP ALL THAT'S INVOLVED WHEN CONFRONTED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ANAHEIM. WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE AT THAT TIME BECAUSE MANY TIMES YOU'RE IN A PANIC AND AS WE JUST SAW RECENTLY ON WHEN THEY SEE AS THE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THOSE KIDS THEY JUST WANTED TO GO HOME SO I THINK THIS IS COMMONSENSE MEASURE WHEN YOU.

LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THIS BILL AND PARTICIPATING IN DEBATE IN- THE ENVIRONMENT CALL THE COMMITTEE IN WE ARE. THAT GIVEN THE- THANK CATION OUR PROCESS HERE KOBE WE DON'T HAVE A- THE YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. FROM CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS TO STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS IS THAT THE STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS YOU KNOW CATEGORY EXEMPTIONS ARE NOT ABSOLUTE STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS ARE. SO THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS IS TO INFORM DECISION MAKERS AND WE LOSE TRACK OF THAT YOU KNOW I. I UNDERSTAND I'M NOT AGAINST BIKE LANES IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE. OTHERS AN EXEMPTION IT APPLIES OF ITSELF OVER HOW MILLION. WHAT WITH THE BIKE LANE BEAT WOULD COST A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS BEYOND ME SO BASICALLY EVERYTHING GETS IN AND THE DECISION MAKERS. ARE DENIED THAT. THAT INFORMATION THAT OPENNESS THAT THE PUBLIC IS THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE UNDERSEA COOPER WOULD YOU SAY YOU HAVE A CATEGORY EXEMPTION THERE'S ALREADY STREAMLINING THAT GOES INTO THIS. THIS FIVE OUR SYSTEM IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND THAT CATEGORY EXEMPTION THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING BUT YOU WHEN YOU SWITCH IT TO A STATUTORY IT'S A NO LOOK. I GET THAT IT'S LIMITED BECAUSE THIS IN RIGHT AWAY. AS I GET THAT IT YOU KNOW IT'S BY PLANE IT'S APPLE AND ALL THESE THINGS BUT I JUST REALLY HAVE A CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE STUCK WITH THIS COVERT SITUATION THIS IS A- DEMOCRAT IS A DIFFERENT BILL THAT LEFT THE FLOOR ONE HERE AND WE HAVEN'T HAD. THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP IT AND THERE'S ANOTHER BILL THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BUT IT THE CHAIR OF THE D. Q. IS HAVING A SIMILAR BILL THAT LOOKS IT FIXED RAIL AND RIDE WAYS THAT. THE NEW ONES THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE HAD WOULD HAVE BEEN HEALTH. A THIS TIME I LOVE MY BIKE PEOPLE I LOVE THE SMART STREETS AND ALL THE AND ALL THE APPLE PIE. BUT I STILL. I AM HESITANT AND- CONCERNED ABOUT SWITCHING IT TO STATUTORY EXEMPTION. THANK YOU SENATOR Y. CASKEY ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR SEEING NONE WILL GO TO A REMOTE PARTICIPANTS SENATOR BORDERS. YESTERDAY WE HAD A ROBUST DISCUSSION ON. SYKORA AND THEN APPARENTLY- IT'S BLEEDING OVER INTO TODAY AS WELL- I THINK THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A WELL THOUGHT THROUGH. WAY ABOVE ALLOWING. FOR MAJOR PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD. ESPECIALLY IN A CORPORATE ENVIRONMENT BUT I DO HAVE TO KIND OF SPARKING BACK. WHY HE SAID THAT WE NEED EXEMPTIONS. WHY DO WE NEED CARVE OUTS FROM SEQUEL UNLESS WE HAVE TO IMPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SEAT ONE IS. YOUR OWN BURDENSOME IT CAN EASILY LEAD TO LITIGATION AND CREATE EXTRAORDINARY DIFFICULTY IN OUR PROJECT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. SO I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR TAKE A HARD LOOK AND HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL ENCOURAGE TO KNOWLEDGE WE WOULDN'T BE SEEKING EXEMPTIONS IF SEEK WHAT WAS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. IT'S NOT. AND I THINK THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. OF PROJECTS FOR A SERIES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD QUALIFY AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE SEE THAT STREAMLINING IS AVAILABLE AND SEEK WORK WHAT A JOKE. ANYBODY WHO SPEND ANY TIME IN LOCAL POLITICS AT THE CITY LEVEL COUNTY LEVEL PLANNING COMMISSION LEVEL THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S REALLY NO SUCH THING. AS A FAST EFFICIENCY WILL PROCESS IN STREAMLINING IS IT SIMPLY A DESCRIPTOR THAT WE USE TO MAKE OURSELVES FEEL GOOD THAT THERE CAN BE A FAST TRACK THERE IS NO FASTRACK. SO I THINK IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE IN THE NEXT CYCLE. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE ADEQUACY OR INADEQUACY OF SEQUEL- I THINK CALIFORNIA BE BETTER OFF FOR IT I. WILL BE SUPPORTING THE STAFFORD TODAY. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR JUST ON THE BILL IS THERE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE BILL. SEEING I'M SORRY WE HAVE SENATOR BATES CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST NEED TO WAIT AGAIN- MY CONTINUALLY VOTE AGAINST THE BILL STATUS REDUCE A PARKING- WE PASSED A BILL I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES PEOPLE HAVE CARS AND THEY'RE GOING TO NEED A PLACE TO PARK THEM PREFERABLY NOT ON THE STREETS THAT SURROUND THESE HOUSING AREAS. BECAUSE THAT IS CLEARLY A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT UP CONTINUALLY BASED ON THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT WITH CHILDREN MOVING BETWEEN PARKED CARS SINCE GETTING HURT OR IN A COUPLE CASES LOSING THEIR LIVES SO I REDUCING PARKING IS NOT THE WAY TO GO OUR PEOPLE ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE CARS AND WE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE THAT. SO BE IT BASED ON THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO REGISTER AND NOBLE INTO WE HAVE A MORE LOGICAL APPROACH WHAT WE DO WITH OUR CARS BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF OUR LIVES AND CERTAINLY IN MANY AREAS AND MORE THE OUTLYING AREAS YOU YOU'RE GONNA NEED A CAR SO WITH THAT I WILL HAVE TO AGAIN OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. SAN DURO I HAD THE CONGRESS WITH THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO BOB PRIMARILY MY CONCERN AND I THINK ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND CONCERN IS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN EXCLUDED FROM PROCESSES- NOT TECHNICALLY BUT DE FACTO AND SO THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT I RAISED ABOUT HOW DO OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE THE VOICE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO REALLY IMPACT THE DECISIONS MADE IN OUR COMMUNITIES- SOME OF THE THINGS. THAT WERE TOLD TO ME IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR COMMITTEES TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A VOICE AND REALLY IMPACT THE OUTCOMES- AND ALSO THAT THIS IS A PILOT- OF PILOT PROGRAM SO- WITH THAT I WILL- SUPPORT TODAY BUT- I THINK THE OVERALL. IT UP ON EASY IN THIS IS ABOUT HOW DOES THIS BREAK INTO OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A REAL VOICE ON THE GROUND THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESIDENT JUST A COUPLE POINTS AND I APPRECIATE THE DEBATE. THE BIKE LANE EXEMPTION IS AN EXISTING EXEMPTION WERE SIMPLY IT'S EXTENDING ITS A PLACE. FOR A WHILE LARGE PROJECTS WILL HAVE TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED FIVE THROUGH REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN DOUBTS THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE A BIKE LANE PROJECT BUT OTHER BUS OR LIGHT RAIL RELATED IF IT'S AN EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY. THIS IS- AS YOU NOTED FOR EVERYONE A TWO YEAR PILOT- WE WORKED ON THIS WITH THAT ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES WILL BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IT- AND YOUR WHATEVER ONE'S VIEW OF BROADER SEQUEL ISSUES- THAT IS WHAT IT IS AND PEOPLE CAN HAVE THAT TO BE- BUT THIS IS PACIFIC LEAD TO ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PROJECTS. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR AGENCY TO DO ANYTHING IT JUST PROVIDES THEM WITH AN ADDITIONAL TOOL- AND THAT INCLUDES AROUND PARKING BUT IT'S STILL A PURELY LOCAL DECISION THIS LEGISLATION MANDATES. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT IS SIMPLY A TOOL I. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I KNOW. ALL DEBATE HAVE SEIZED MADAM. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN AYE ARCHULETA AYE ATKINS AYE BELL.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR. SB FIVE NINETY TWO- IT IS- LEGISLATION- TO ENSURE. THAT OUR- OUR JURIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. HI RIGHT NOW WHEN WE PICK JURIES IN CALIFORNIA WE DRAW FROM A POOL THAT IS LIMITED. TO THE DMV. OUR RECORDS AS WELL AS VOTER REGISTRATION FILES. DOT IS NOT BROAD ENOUGH. AND IT EXCLUDES A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE IF YOU'RE NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE YOU WILL NEVER GET CALLED FOR JURY DUTY AS WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY. THE POLICING IS TO STOP ONE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM YOU CAN. GO TO COURT. AND WE RELY ON OUR JURY SYSTEM TO PROVIDE A JURY OF ONE'S PEERS. AND RIGHT NOW THAT IS OFTEN NOT HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA JURIES ARE WHITER. AND WEALTHIER- THAN THE COMMUNITY. AT LARGE. AND SB FIVE NINETY WILL CHANGE THAT. BY SAYING THAT IN ADDITION TO DRAWING JURY POOLS. ARE FROM DMV AND VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASES WE WILL ALSO USE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TAXPAYER. ARE ROLES THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BROADEN NOW- THE GROUP OF PEOPLE FROM WHICH FROM HOME WE- ARE DRAW OUR JURIES IT WILL RESULT IN MORE DIVERSE- JURIES. AND THIS IS A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME- I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS NOT. THE FIRST TIME- DIED WE HAVE A- CONSIDERED- THIS IDEA THIS IS IDEA I KNOW SENATOR SKINNER HAD AS PART OF ONE OF HER- PIECES OF LEGISLATION IN THE PAST- I THINK OTHERS HAVE. INCLUDED IT WITH OTHER- IDEAS AND BILLS AND IT'S ALWAYS GOTTEN STRIPPED OUT AND APPROPRIATIONS ALL THIS YEAR- WE DID AS A STANDALONE BILL. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THE BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR. FAISAL THANK YOU AT A PRESS. Y. ABOUT THIS YES INCREASE THE POOL OF ELIGIBLE JURORS AND I THINK THIS BILL. GOES A LONG WAY TO ADDED TO THAT IT'S OF COURSE SO THERE'S MORE THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT- EVERYONE. IN OUR SOCIETY HAS EQUAL ACCESS TO THAT- BUT IN THE SPIRIT OF. THE INTENT WITH HIS BILLS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK WE ALL SHOULD SUPPORT IT. WHY WHY SHOULD WE NOT SUPPORT. ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING SURE OUR JURIES ARE TRULY REPRESENTED OF SOCIETY THIS IS A GREAT BILL I SUPPORTED. THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING NO HANDS NOPE WE HAVE SENATOR MORE LOCK- IN THE REMOTE. PARTICIPATION AREA CENTER MORE LOCKED THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE WERE WORKING ON THIS YEAR AND SORT OF GOT BOUNCED OUT WITH THAT WHAT WOULD NINETEEN WAS. THAT WHEN THE REGISTERED VOTERS IS USED AS A SOURCE FOR POTENTIAL JURORS SOMETIMES THOSE INDIVIDUALS. INFORMED THE CLERK OF THE COURT THAT THEY CANNOT SERVE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT CITIZENS. AND SO I'M- WONDERING IF IN THIS BILL THERE'S MAYBE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAN THAT. UP SO THAT WE- I HAVE VOTER ROLLS THAT ARE. PROPERLY UPDATED ANTHOLOGIZED MY LUNCH JUST DIRECTORS BY MY- BARBERING BUT I MAYBE THE AUTHOR CAN JUST CLARIFY THAT IS CLOSE THE REMARKS. PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES CENTER WIENER BUT WE ALSO ARE ANYTHING FURTHER CENTER MORE LOCKED. IT TOO MANAGER THANK YOU VERY GOOD SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KING A MAN PRESENT THANK YOU. SIX YEARS AGO I RAN A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED LEGAL RESIDENTS PEOPLE WITH GREEN CARDS- TO PARTICIPATE IN INJURIES UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS VETOED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN- FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO TALKS ABOUT INCREASING THE POOL TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. OVER 90% OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE LEGAL RESIDENTS THAT DON'T HAVE U. S. CITIZENSHIP SO I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY IT'S ALL TO MY- CHAU MY CARDS A LITTLE BIT OF A LEGISLATION I HOPE TO BE RUNNING NEXT YEAR THAT WOULD EXPAND THE JURY POOL TO LEGAL RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. WHO MEET ALL THE OTHER QUALIFICATIONS THAT ARE SET FORTH IN S. B. FIVE NINE TWO THAT DEBATE HAS HAPPEN IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN. THANK YOU NO O. I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONES OR HANDS UP CENTER WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU INTO THE- CENTER FROM- FREMONT I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND OF COURSE THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY- IS ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO ARE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE NOT GETTING CALLED UP BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ON ANY OF THE LIMITED DATABASES THAT ARE BEING USED- IN TERMS OF NON CITIZENS AND BY THE CENTER FOR ORANGE COUNTY IS- QUESTIONS ON THE JURY- VENEER PROCESS ALREADY HAS A FAIL SAFE TO REMOVE- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT CITIZENS WHO OR WHO ARE OTHERWISE INELIGIBLE FOR JURY SERVICE.

SB SIX TWENTY NINE COLLEAGUES SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY NINE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC SAFETY SENATOR MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH A MATTER PRESIDENTE ABRASIVES IN PRISON SB SIX TWENTY NINE WHICH IS THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS ACT WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT JOURNALISTS ARE PROTECTED AS THEY ATTEND DEMONSTRATIONS AND MARCHES PROTESTS AND RALLIES ALL FIRST AMENDMENT BY PROHIBITING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM INTENTIONALLY OBSTRUCTING DETAINING ASSAULTING OR OTHERWISE PREVENTING THE PRESS FROM FULFILLING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE IN REPORTING ON THESE FIRST AMENDMENT EVENTS. SB SIX TWENTY NINE WORKS IN CRUCIAL PROTECTIONS TO MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AS THE INTERN REPORT ON THESE INCIDENTS THIS BILL SUPPORTED OF COURSE FOR THE CALIFORNIA BROADCASTERS ASSOCIATION THE COMPANIES PUBLISH NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION ETHNIC MEDIA SERVICES BECOME REPORTERS COMMITTING A STILL YOU WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE CERNEY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. SHE NON IN THE- IN INDIA A BACKYARD THERE WE'VE GOT SENATOR MORRELL FOLLOWED BY SENATOR BORCHERS SENATOR MORRELL. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR AUTHOR WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION CENTER MCGUIRE OF COURSE THINKING WITHOUT OBJECTION PLEASE PROCEED. YEAH YES I THOUGHT I READ IN THE ANALYSIS AND I JUST WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK WITH YOU WILL THE PRESS BE ALLOWED TO CROSS THE POLICE LINE. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE BEHIND THE POLICE LINE UP BUT A SUPERIOR AND MANAGEMENT OFFICIAL WITHIN. SHERIFF'S OFFICE EACH FEE AND OR LOCAL MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENT. WOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THAT INDIVIDUAL TO NOT BE THERE INDOOR FORCIBLY REMOVED IF THERE IS DANGER AT THE TIME. BUT BUILT OKAY. THIS STORY HAS A DOUBLE MEANING- NO MILITARY CLASS AND. HOW CAN THEY CROSS POLICE LINES MY QUESTION CAN IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND.OKAY THANKS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT UP WE HAVE A SENATOR BORCHERS FROM OUR REMOTE PARTICIPATION SENATOR BOARD JUST. THANK YOU MARY- POSE A QUESTION FOR YOU BETTER PRESIDENT TO THE AUTHOR. WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SENATOR MCGUIRE YES MA'AM GOOD MORNING CENTER WERE JUST. PLEASE MORNING- I THINK MY- COLLEAGUE A MOMENT AGO ASKED ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS GOING TO POSE BUT THE DEFINITION OF A REPORTER. I THINK- SEEMS LIKE EVERY TOM DICK AND HARRY- PUTS ON SOME SORT OF BADGE INSTEAD IS THAT BIGGER MEDIA WHEN THEY HAD SIMPLY HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE- IS THERE. IS THIS PROPERLY DELINEATED IN IN A WAY THAT WOULD ONLY ALLOW FOR- RECOGNIZABLE IN OBJECTIVE. NEWS OUTLETS. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTREBOARD JUST. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL MEDIA OUTLETS SO WHAT THE BILL DOES THE BILL LANGUAGE- ALLOWS FOR DULY AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE THE PRESS WHICH IS ALREADY IN PENAL CODE RIGHT NOW FOUR OH NINE POINT FIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA STATUTE- CONTAIN BUT WHAT WE DO IS WE HELP REFINE IT. SO WHAT WE SAY IN THIS BILL NOW IS. YOUR IDENTIFIED NUMBER THE PRESS THE ENHANCED DEFINITION OF PROFESSIONAL BROADCASTING EQUIPMENT AND OR ID THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO AN INDIVIDUAL LAUNCH FOR SPIRE REQUESTED. SO YOU'VE YOU'VE TRIED TO GIVE IT THE AIR OF FORMALITY BUT IT'S DIFFICULT TO NARROW IT DOWN. BECAUSE EVEN IF SOMEBODY HAS A HUNDRED FACEBOOK FOLLOWERS THEY COULD PUT THEMSELVES OUT THERE AS BEING A NEWS OUTLET. SO IS THAT IN HERE TO SAY THIS IS THE LAST QUESTION WE'RE NOT ENGAGING IN COLLOQUY HERE IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT OR PERHAPS IN YOUR CLOTHES OF COURSE I'D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND ANY GAINS AND WE'RE JUST THANK YOU FOR THESE QUESTIONS AND I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE GOOD QUESTIONS. THAT WE LIVE IN AN ERA NOW WHERE IF YOU WORK FOR ABC NEWS OR SEEN IN OR FOX NEWS OR YOU WORK FOR THE SACRAMENTO BEE OR LA TIMES THE NEW YORK TIMES. A REPORTERS CARRYING THEIR IPHONE OR ANDROID TO BE ABLE TO RECORD BOTH ON FACEBOOK LIVE WHETHER IT'S FOR THE OUTLET'S FACEBOOK PAGE AND OR TO BE ABLE TO STREAM ON THEIR OWN TWITTER FEED. THAT WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME SO WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN THE BILL IS THAT WHILE THERE IS NO CURRENT DEFINITION OF A DULY AUTHORIZED MEMBER THE PRESS IN LAW TODAY. EVERY PERSON THAT'S LISTED IN THE BILL'S DEFINITION BE CONSIDERED A DULY AUTHORIZED OVER THE MEDIA AND PRACTICE IN THE FIELD SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE CARRYING WE REFINANCED BY SAYING YOU'RE CARRYING PROFESSIONAL BROADCASTING EQUIPMENT OR HAVE THAT. IDEA AVAILABLE- YOU WOULD BE PRESS BUT WE'RE LIVING IN SUCH TIMES NOW JUST BEING VERY HONEST ABOUT IT AND WE SEEN THIS IS THAT- MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA THEIR MOST POWERFUL TOOL THAT THEY HAVE IS. THEIR PHONE THAT'S IN THEIR BACK POCKET. THANK YOU I THINK. I THINK. YOU'RE EFFORTS AT DECISION OR COMMIT THERE ARE SOME CRACKED. CONCERNS THAT I WOULD HAVE. ONLY BECAUSE WINNING FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT FOR EXAMPLE IS EMBEDDED WITH THE MILITARY. THEY ASSUME A DEGREE OF RISK ACTUALLY THE USE OF ALL THE RISKS THE MILITARY IS NOT UNDER AN OBLIGATION AS FAR AS I'M AWARE OF PROVIDING PROTECTION ARE ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT. THE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NORMALLY OUT OF ALLOW HERE IF. MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AND BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A NEBULOUS. CONCEPT ON WHAT EXACTLY A PRESS OUTLETS IS. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE FORCED TO ALLOW ACCESS TO A NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT. PROBABLY COULD BE QUESTIONABLE WHETHER NOT THERE ACTUALLY- JOURNALISTS OR MEMBERS OF THE PRESS SO YOU'RE ASKING LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ECOR BREAK THEM INTO AN UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT. ON FIRST AMENDMENT GROUNDS WHICH I THINK IS ADMIRABLE BUT FROM PRACTICAL STANDPOINT IT AREN'T YOU PUTTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALL IN THIS WOULD BE MY OPINION I THINK WE'RE PUTTING LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A REALLY DIFFICULT POSITION HERE AND WHAT IT COULD BE EXACERBATING ABOLISHED FILE. AND FLUID DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT AND I THINK THE EFFORT IS IN THE RIGHT TRACK I JUST THINK THAT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE OPPOSITION. AND I SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE OF THE OPINION THAT YOU'RE ASKING THEM TO OPEN UP. AN ILL DEFINED GROUP OF FOLKS WHO MAY VERY WELL MISS REPRESENT THEMSELVES INCREASE EVEN MORE HAVOC SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE BUT I COMMEND THE EFFORT THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING NONE SENATOR MCGUIRE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH MANY PRESIDENT INTO GRATEFUL TO SIT AROUND AND AS WELL AS CENTER BRIDGES FOR THE QUESTION AND THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE AT THIS BILL WE WORKED WITH THE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY TO BE ABLE TAKE THREE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS NUMBER ONE WE GOT RID OF THE PRESUMPTION NUMBER TWO WE GOT RID OF THE MISDEMEANOR. NUMBER THREE WE GOT RID OF THE FINANCIAL PENALTY AND HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY. IS THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE SIMPLY EXTENDING THE STATUTE THAT EXISTS IN STATE LAW TODAY FOR JOURNALISTS DURING TIMES OF NATURAL DISASTER AND WE EXTEND IT TO FIRST AMENDMENT EVENTS THIS IS JACKET THAT IS ALREADY IN LAW. IN BY THE WAY REPORTERS ARE ALREADY HAVING TO BE ABLE TO FACE THIS COVERING THESE FIRST AMENDMENTS OVER FIVE HUNDRED REPORTERS FIVE HUNDRED REPORTERS JOURNALISTS THIS YEAR ALONE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA HAVE EITHER BEEN DETAINED AND OR ASSAULTED. WHILE COVERING THESE FIRST AND INDEPENDENCE IN IT HAS TO STOP THIS IS A BALANCED APPROACH A MODERN APPROACH THAT WE PROTECT OUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS AND ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO DO THEIR JOB AND HOLDING ALL OF US IN. A IN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE. WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ALL HAVING. MADAM SIR. PLEASE THE ROLL. ALLEN HI I. ARCHULETA. ATKINS I FELL. FIVE BRADFORD FIVE CABALLERO.

IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WHO IS ABOUT TO RETIRE I WILL TRY I WILL NOT MAKE ANY JOKES ABOUT THAT FOR FEAR OF OFFENDING ANYONE- BUT WE HAVE WITH US IN THE BACK OF THE WHOLE OF OUR ARMED THREE PARTNER DIANE BORDER VINE WHO HAS MADE THE DECISION TO GO QUIETLY INTO THE- INTO THE NIGHT. WE WILL MISS HER DEARLY AND WE WILL START OUR- REPROGRAM- WITH OUR PRO TEM SENATOR ATKINS. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND NOW BEFORE I GET STARTED ON SOME COMMENTS ABOUT OUR INCREDIBLE OF COUNSEL LET ME OUT RECOGNIZE THAT SHE HAS SOME FAMILY IN THE GALLERY WITH US TODAY HER HUSBAND HAIRY. OPERA TRICIA HER SISTER. DAUGHTERS ANGELA AND JENNY WITH THEIR HUSBANDS AND CHILDREN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT HER SON JACK IS WATCHING- FROM SAN FRANCISCO SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FAMILY. I ESPECIALLY IS WHERE THEY'LL END OF SESSION AND WE KNOW HOW MUCH OF A FAMILY PROBABLY MISSES US AT- THIS TIME. SO IF WE COULD PERHAPS AROUND REPLIES WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS. WE APPRECIATE THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT MADAM PRESIDENT- THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF FAMILIES IS IMPORTANT. AT THE END OF SESSION THE FOUR LEADERS IN BOTH HOUSES ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK OF DIANE BOYER VINE AND HER INCREDIBLE TEAM. BECAUSE THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THEY'RE AMAZING ABILITY AND EFFORT ARE PROBABLY MOST IN FOCUS. SEND OF SESSION WE RISE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL NOT ONLY FOR HER AMAZING ABILITY AND EFFORT THIS YEAR. BUT ALSO FOR THE ENTIRE CAREER SHE IS BRINGING TO A CLOSE HERE IN THE CAPITAL. THANK YOU MADAM COUNCIL FOR ALWAYS GIVING US THE ANSWERS AND ADVICE WE NEEDED. NOT NECESSARILY THE ONES WE WANTED ARE THE ONES WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE. IN THE TIME WE HAVE I WANT TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT I AM PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL TO OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR HER- BEING PART OF AND THAT IS THE EFFORT TO CHANGE THE CLIMATE I THIS CAPITAL AND CREATE A WORKPLACE THAT IS SAFE AND RESPECTFUL. FOR ALL. WE KNOW THAT THAT IS AN ASPIRATIONAL GOAL WE KNOW THE PROBLEMS WILL BE SOLVED BY THE TIME THE% LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL LEAVES OR MAYBE NOT EVEN BY THE TIME SOME OF US LEAVE. BUT WE ARE ON THE PATH AND DIANE BOY LEVINE HELPED US GET THERE. AND WHEN THAT GOAL IS ACHIEVED I HOPE THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WILL ONCE AGAIN HONOR DIANE BOY VYING FOR HER IMPORTANT ROLE IN THAT. NOW I SANDERS I AM BY DIANE RETIRING. I'VE TRIED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF FUN THIS WEEK I KEEP EMAILING HER WITH FAKE CHALLENGES TO MAKE THIS LAST YEAR LOOK EASY BY COMPARISON. HERE'S JUST A COUPLE. IT TURNS OUT ONE OF OUR SENATORS MAY ACTUALLY BE A GIANT BATTERY POWERED BY THE RABBIT. DOES THAT IMPACT HIS ABILITY TO VOTE. HEY THIS WEEK WE PASSED THE BILL THAT WAS NEVER FORMALLY INTRODUCED.

THIS IS THE RENAMING OF AN EXISTING STATE DEPARTMENT IT'S NOT THE CREATION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY.

AS A PERTAINS TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY OFFICE AND ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO REFORM NEW ACTIVITIES SUCH AS CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCT MARKET RESEARCH AND TARGETED CONSUMER OUTREACH. IT PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE AND OVERSEE NEW COVERED PERSONS AND CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT PROHIBITS NEWLY COVERED PERSONS IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ENGAGING IN UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES. GRANTED APARTMENT POWERS THE SPECIFIED LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT LIMITATIONS TO PROMULGATE RULES AND REGULATIONS REGARDING THE REGISTRATION OF COVERED PERSONS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS PROVIDING CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS.

SENATOR MITCHELL ARE YOU GOING TO BE TAKING UP THAT ITEM. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TO THIRTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC SAFETY SENATOR MITCHELL MEMBERS THIRTY TO THIRTY FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY TRAILER BILL THAT INCLUDES TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS THAT REFLECT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE'S DATA AND EVIDENCE BASED PROPOSALS FOR REDUCING OUR STATE THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLAR PRISON BUDGET PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY AND ACHIEVING OVERALL BUDGETARY SAVINGS. THE PROVISIONS WERE A TRAILER BILL THAT PASSED ON OUR FLOOR IN JUNE. THIS BILL MAKES THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THOSE THAT PREVIOUS ACTION THAT WE ARE READY TO. THIS BILL GIVE STATEWIDE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY TO OFFER OPTIONAL MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIED OFFENSES. THE BILL INCLUDES STATUTORY CHANGES TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS HOUSE OF THE STATE'S PRISONS. A LOT OF THE ON GOING COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY CHANGED THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR AN ELDERLY PAROLE SLOOPS ABILITY HEARING. ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM IS THERE ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR NIELSEN. THE SENATE THE THIS CONTINUES A- DISCONCERTING PRECEDENT THAT'S BEEN SET. A LOT OF VERY DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE DONE VERY SEVERE CRIMES GREATLY AGREED THE PUBLIC NOT JUST THEIR VICTIMS BUT SOCIETY AND A WHOLE. WHERE BECAUSE OF HOLDEN THEY'RE GOING TO GET EARLY RELEASE TO SOCIETY. NOW I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A PAUSE AND THINK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT. THE GET OUT OF PRISON. TICKETS NOW IS PUBLISHED. WELL THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO COME OUT HAVING BEEN IN A VULNERABLE ENVIRONMENT THE CONTRACT COBIT. WE'RE GONNA AND THEIR- VULNERABLE POPULATION ANYWAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT HIM OUT AND OUR COMMUNITIES. I GUARANTEE YOU THEY WILL BE LARGELY UNSUPERVISED. AND NOT SUBJECT TO ANY PUNISHMENT. OR CONSEQUENCES IF THEY CONTINUE THEIR CRIMINALITY. SO OUR CITIZENS THAT WE REPRESENT ARE NOW ECOMING VULNERABLE TO THE BEHAVIOR OF DEMONSTRATED PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISREGARDED. THE SAFETY OF SOCIETY AND WHO NOW THEMSELVES MAY WELL BE A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT AND VERY SEVERE THREAT. I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE BECAUSE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS TREND. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN CENTER GALGIANI. FROM TIME TO TIME I'M CALLED UPON BY ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS TO ANONYMOUSLY CALL OUR SHERIFF AND SILICON COUNTY ON BEHALF OF SHE AND HER NEIGHBORS BECAUSE OF GANG ACTIVITY THAT IS IN WITHIN THIS VERY VERY SMALL COURT- A LARGE NUMBER OF DISABLED AND ELDERLY RESIDENTS THERE. JUST THREE WEEKS AGO SHE CALLED ME AND SHE WAS IN TEARS AND SHE WAS DESCRIBING HOW- ONE OF THE GANG MEMBERS HAD GONE TO THE HOUSE OF A HUSBAND AND WIFE AND GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT THE WIFE COMES OUT OF THE BATHROOM. THE GANG MEMBER THROWS GASOLINE ON HER. AND THEN THROWS A LIGHTER ON HER AND SET HER ON FIRE. THE HUSBAND TRIES TO HELP HE SETS HIMSELF ON FIRE BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE IN THE PROCESS HE GOT GASOLINE ON HIM. THE TWO OF THEM RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE. BY THE TIME THE NEIGHBORS HEARD THE SCREAMING AND SOMEBODY GOT TO JOSE TRIED TO PUT THEM OUT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GOT THERE AFTER THE DAMAGE WAS ALREADY DONE 85% BURNS TO BOTH OF THEIR BODIES AND IT WAS SO BAD THAT IN FACT THE SUSPECT CAUGHT HIMSELF ON FIRE AND HE'S AT A HOSPITAL HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND TO. CALL IN AN INDUCED COMA AND THAT SAME EVENING THAT VERY SAME EVENING. WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE NEIGHBORS AND THE WHOLE CIRCLE WE'RE TOLD THAT IF YOU SPEAK TO THE COPS YOUR NEXT. IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THIS BILL INCLUDES DIVERSION FOR DISSUADING A WITNESS OR CRIME pVICTIMS. FROM REPORTING A CRIME OR TESTIFYING. WHEN VICTIMS OF CRIME ARE SILENCED AND THEY FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE WE ALL SUFFER AND I WILL REMIND PEOPLE TO THIS IS AN INCIDENT THAT JUST HAPPENED THREE WEEKS AGO IN MY DISTRICT. BUT WITH THE CASE YOU'VE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT BEFORE WITH WESLEY SHERMAN KIND AND LAUREN HERZOG SERIAL KILLERS THAT WERE OPERATING IN MY DISTRICT FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT FOR FOURTEEN YEARS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD AND BECAUSE THEY WERE SILENCED. THEY WERE SILENCED AND THEY WERE AFRAID FOR THEIR LIVES THIS IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS OFFENSE. DISSUADING A WITNESS OR CRIME VICTIMS FROM REPORTING A CRIME OR TESTIFYING I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE SENATE FLOOR. SEEING NON WE DO HAVE TO PAN SHOP OF REMOTELY WE WILL START WITH SENATOR DOLLY AND THEN NOT BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- I ALSO TO RISE IN OPPOSITION I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT CDC ARE ACTUALLY. EXPECTED MORE PRISONERS BE BY MOVING PRISONERS FROM SAN QUENTIN TO LASSEN WHICH IS THE HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON WE HAD FOUR INFECTED PRISONERS MOVED HERE WE DID IT WAS SIX HUNDRED CASES OF COVE IT. IN OUR PRISON. OUT OF THOSE SIX HUNDRED I WILL SHARE THIS WITH YOU- ALL OF THEM NOW ARE HEALED UP AND ONLY ONE HAD TO GO. TO THE HOSPITAL. AND TO BE TREATED FOR THE ACTUAL CODE BUT THE POINT IS THAT WE'RE ALLOWING THESE PRISONERS TO GET OUT BECAUSE OF KOBLET. AT OUR ACTUAL. PHONE POLICIES FROM THE STATE RAN PRISON IS CAUSING COBIT SO FOR THAT REASON I WOULD OPPOSE THIS BILL JUST BECAUSE THERE S NO REASON TO LET THESE PRISONERS OUT THERE GETTING ILL. AND THEY NEED TO BE IN PRISON WHERE THEY CONSERVE THEIR TIME FOR THE CRIME WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS NEVER TALK ABOUT THE FAMILIES THAT. HAVE HAD. IT'S GOING TO BE THREATENED AS WE JUST HEARD IN THE LAST SPEAKERS INFORMATION OR THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN IMPACTED FOREVER BECAUSE OF THESE CRIMINALS. AND THAT WE RISKS WERE DISCONTINUED A LOT ABOUT HIM THE OTHER TRYING TO GET COVERED SO THEY CAN GET OUT AND IT'S JUST WRONG SO I. URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU- THE SENATOR GROWTH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE CENTER SKYNYRD INTO YOU MY CUT MY APOLOGIES CENTER GROWTH FLOOR SHORES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR UNDER HIS EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY IS RELEASING THOUSANDS OF CRIMINALS AND FROM OUR PRISON SYSTEMS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IF YOUR CHILDREN ARE OUTSIDE THE NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT. THE ELDERLY POPULATION WHICH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTER VALLEY JUST DESCRIBED IN THE NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT M. INDIVIDUALS IN PLACES IN MY DISTRICT AND NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT BUT EVERYONE'S DISTRICT. WITH AN INDIVIDUAL GET OUT ON ZERO BELL WHICH IS SAM- IT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT HERE BUT IT'S ABOUT JUST RELEASING AND RELAXING AND CRIMINALS ARE THE ACTIVITY THAT CRIMINALS ARE BEING ABLE TO BE SUBJECTED TO. WHEN YOU RELEASE- AT ZERO BELT FOR INSTANCE- THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT THIS PERSON IN JAIL AND REQUIRE BAIL BUT BECAUSE OF KOBE HE WAS RELEASED AND THEN HE ENDED UP ROBBING A STORE CLEAN FROM THE POLICE. IN A TULARE COUNTY CAME AROUND A CORNER BY A PARK AND HE RAN OVER A THIRTY PLUS YEAR OLD MOM AND HER TWO KIDS WATCH THAT WOMAN IS NOW DEAD BECAUSE OF THIS PRISONER BEING. RELEASED ON ZERO ABOUT. THE GOVERNOR PUTTING TOGETHER AS RELEASING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WE HEARD WAS UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND IT WAS EIGHTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT FROM EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND FIFTY THOUSAND CRIMINALS INTO OUR STREETS AND INTO OUR COMMUNITIES- THAT IS. ALL OF US IN DANGER NOT JUST AS THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS IT PUT THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN DANGER THAT OUR ELDERLY DOESN'T LIVE ALONE WOMEN WHO ARE SUBJECT TO VIOLENT CRIMES AGAIN INTO. THIS ANARCHY ON OUR STREETS WITH INDIVIDUALS BEING RELEASED INTO OUT OF PRISON. AND YOU KNOW NOT TAKING INTO ANY CONSIDERATION THE VICTIM- WE HAD AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON AND THAT HE- HE TERRORIZED HIS EX WIFE- WITH CALLING ON THE FLOOR IN THE SAME TYPE OF SITUATION. BUT THIS INDIVIDUAL TERRORIZED HIS EX WIFE TO THE POINT WHERE HE WAS IN. BECAUSE OF OUR CENTER. AND TERROR IS WIFE AND KIDS FOUR HUNDRED FIVE YEARS AND HE GETS OUT HE GETS OUT OF PRISON WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS WHAT ABOUT THIS WIFE. WHAT ABOUT HER CHILDREN SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S VICTIMIZED ALL OVER AGAIN AND SHE WENT ON TELEVISION TO SAY THAT. YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS GETTING OUT OF PRISON THAT IT COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES. COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST VICTIMS AND THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO- CONSIDERATION FOR THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES SO NOW THE VICTIM WAS EXPECTING SOMEBODY TO BE IN PRISON- FOR WHATEVER MANY YEARS AND THEY'RE GETTING OUT. AND THEY HAVE TO REALLY OF NOT ONLY THE CRIME THAT WAS PERPETRATED AGAINST THEM AS A VICTIM. BUT ALSO WORRY ABOUT BEING PROTECTED FROM THE POLICE WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY I'M CHANGING THE WHOLE WORLD OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND DEFENDING THEM WHERE'S THE PROTECTION GOING TO COMPANIES STATE VICTIMS WAS HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A COLLEAGUE IN THAT COLLEAGUES AS WELL THEY CAN GET A RESTRAINING ORDER. WHEN SOMEBODY'S COMING AFTER YOU WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT YOU ARE WAITING A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPER IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THEM GO AWAY OR STOP. SO TO RELEASE AND I REALIZE LIKE THE BUDGET CHAIR SAIDSHE'S VERY SMART SHE'S VERY ARTICULATE SHE UNDERSTANDS ALL THE BUDGET STAFF I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE KEEPS IT STRAIGHT WITH ALL THE BUDGET BILLS THAT GO THROUGH. GOING TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY TO RELEASE THESE PEOPLE INTO THE POPULATION IN INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY I REALIZE THAT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO KEEP PEOPLE IN PRISON. BUT THESE PEOPLE ARE IN PRISON TRIED BY A JURY OF THEIR PEERS AND THEY'RE IN PRISON FOR A REASON AND I WANT YOU TO TRY TO THINK ABOUT THE- THE VICTIMS. THAT WILL BE- ASSAULTED AGAIN WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE RELEASED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU CENTER GROVE. THE SENATORS SKINNER. WAT THE WOULD YOU. OKAY NOW HERE YOU. I AM NOT IN CONTROL OF THIS WICKS THERE YOU GO ALL RIGHT. CAN YOU MAY YOU MAY RECEIVE THANK YOU I AM COMPOSING MYSELF. IT IS SEEMINGLY POPULAR TO. THROWN AROUND VERY INACCURATE AND SENSATIONAL STATISTICS ABOUT VIOLENT CRIME WE'RE HEARING IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN ACTUALLY VIOLENT CRIME IS DOWN IT IS ALSO SEEMINGLY- POPULAR TO MAKE REFERENCES TO THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BILL BEFORE US SO LET ME CLARIFY WHAT IS IN THE BILL BEFORE US WHAT IS IN THE BILL BEFORE US. IS NOT A STATE MANDATE IT IS. A ABILITY FOR A COURT. IF I COUNTY APPROVES IT FOR COURT TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION PROGRAM AND EVEN WITH IN THAT MISDEMEANOR DIVERSION. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF CRIMES THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. SO IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR. POLICIES ON JUST LOOKING AT MY NOTES. IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR SEX OFFENSES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A WHOLE VARIETY OF AND OF COURSE REMEMBER NOW REFERRING TO MISDEMEANOR SO THESE WOULD BE MISDEMEANOR. SEX OFFENSES AND MISDEMEANORS- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING BUT THOSE ARE EXCLUDED SO THIS IS PURELY OPTIONAL FOR FOURTEEN COUNTIES IF THEY SO CHOOSE AND IT'S BASED ON A VERY SUCCESSFUL DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN OPERATING IN L. A. COUNTY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT'S THE DIVERSION PROGRAM THAT'S IN THIS BILL IT IS NOT A MANDATE. IT IS NOT A AUTHORIZING THE STATE WIDE IT IS ALLOWING COUNTIES IF THEY SO CHOOSE AND COURTS THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS BILL THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS BILL. IS THE NEXT DATE REVISION TO THE LEGISLATURE'S OWN APPROVED STATUTE AROUND MEDICAL PAROLE. NOW FOR MEDICAL PAROLE STATUTE REQUIRES IF. E. CDCR. RECOMMENDS AND OF COURSE THIS REQUIRES CDCR TO RECOMMEND AN INDIVIDUAL FOR MEDICAL PAROLE THAT INDIVIDUAL STILL MUST GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD. SO THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RELEASES THAT THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY ALLOWED YOU TO COBIT AND THOSE RELEASES MORE. EXCLUDED TO PEOPLE WHO WERE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF RELEASE. AND THE GOVERNOR HAS DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES FOR SUCH- RELEASES THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THOSE THIS BILL ONLY REVISES OUR OWN STATUTE WHERE A PERSON AN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL IF THEY ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE PRISON SYSTEM TO BE CONSIDERED FOR MEDICAL PAROLE THEY WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE PROBOARDS PROBOARDS WOULD STILL REVIEW IT VICTIMS WOULD BE ABLE TO COME FORWARD. JUDGES D. A.'S COULD WEIGH IN AND IF WE LOOK HISTORICALLY OVER THE TEN SAY ODD YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD SUCH MEDICAL PAROLE THERE HAVE BEEN VERY VERY FEW. FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN GIVEN MEDICAL PAROLE SO THAT IS WHAT'S IN THE BILL AND I WANTED TO BE VERY CLEAR. SO THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER US SENATOR MELENDEZ. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS NOT A POPULARITY CONTEST SO- LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE JAIL THIS BILL ALLOWS A JUDGE TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED DIVERSION FOR ANY MISDEMEANOR WITH THE EXCLUSION OF SEX OFFENSES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING. IT DOES ALLOW FOR- pCHILD ABUSE D. Y. HATE CRIMES BRINGING A FIREARM INTO A LEGISLATIVE OFFICE ASSAULT BATTERY IDENTITY THEFT VEHICLE VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER POSSESSING A FIREARM- UPON OR WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOL IN ON THE GROUNDS ALL ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION IT SOUNDS LIKE A REAL NICE BUNCH DOESN'T IT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS EVERY TIME WE HAVE A BILL THAT COMES UP LIKE THIS IT'S MADE OUT TO BE THAT I WOULD SUGGEST THESE LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS WHAT'S THE HARM. IF YOU LISTENED TO THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IF YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEM YOU WOULD HEAR THE TYPE OF HARM. THAT MAY BE BECAUSE THIS THIS IS SO INAPPROPRIATE AND TO GO FURTHER WITH RESPECT TO THE ELDERLY PAROLE PROGRAM. CAROLI AGREE JUST BY THE WAY. YOU TARGET INMATES WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE MOST VIOLENT AND TROUBLING CRIME SO THEIR SO CALLED NON VIOLENCE AND THESE ARE IN MAJOR BORROWER RECEIVED EXPEDITED PAROLE HEARINGS BY THE WAY UNDER PROP SIXTY SEVEN. AND THREE STRIKES INMATES ARE EXEMPTED SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THERESULT OF REDUCED SENTENCES FOR CRIMES LIKE MURDER KIDNAPPING RAPE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THIS IS. IT GOD HELP US YOU KNOW IF WE CONTINUE WITH BILLS LIKE THIS BECAUSE AND BY THE WAY I DON'T THINK LOS ANGELES SHOULD REALLY BE HELD UP AS THE LITMUS TEST OR BENCHMARK FOR HELPING SHOULD BE DONE PROPERLY GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON THERE SO I. WHOLEHEARTEDLY ASK FOR YOUR NO BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BORCHERS. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TITLE OF THIS pWAS SIXTEEN AND HAS NOW BEEN REDUCED DOWN TO FIFTY. SO WHAT OCCURRED TO ME IS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A DUAL PURPOSE JUNE LEGISLATION. ONE IT HAS ON CERTAINLY HAS A SOCIAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM ELEMENT TO IT. BUT THE SECOND. WAS THE ELDERLY PAROLE PROGRAM. WAIT FOR THE STATE TO NOT HAVE TO SHOULDER THE MEDICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING INMATES. I'M WONDERING IF THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT TO THIS CALCULATION. THAT CALIFORNIA WOULD SAVE MONEY BY GETTING RID OF FOLKS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE. ACTUARIALLY MORE EXPOSED AND IN NEED OF MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE REASON I BRING IT UP IS THAT IF THERE'S A COST FACTOR TO THIS. IN ADDITION TO THE SOCIAL ARGUMENT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE'S A COST FACTOR HERE. IS NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. IF PEOPLE ARE HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES TO PAYING THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE THEIR- LIVING ENVIRONMENT- HABITABLE ON WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH WITH. BASICS OF MEDICAL ATTENTION SO ON AND SO FORTH. SO I GUESS I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE CYNICAL ABOUT IT BUT IS THIS MOSTLY JUST A COST SAVING AFTER THAT THE RHETORICALLY NOT EXPECTING- THE FLOOR MANAGER TO RESPOND BUT- IF THAT IS THE CASE I THINK IT'S TROUBLING BECAUSE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DEBT TO SOCIETY. STILL HAVE. YET EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OUT OF PRISON AND IN MY OPINION. BECAUSE IT FOR LOCAL OUT FOR THESE EXTERNALITIES EXPONENTIAL EXTERNALITIES. THEN WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE ON THAT IF YOU'RE TOO COSTLY WE WILL SHED YOU FROM THE RANKS AND THAT I THINK IS POOR POLICY. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING NO HANDS UP REMOTELY ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT. BOB PRITCHETT ALL OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND THIS TRAILER BILL LET ME START WHICH IS PROVIDING SOME I THINK IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS- I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE AND DANGEROUS WHEN WE START TO ON THIS FLOOR GIVE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC SPECIFIC CRIMES. BECAUSE WHILE ALL OF THOSE THINGS SOUND ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC AND NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO BE A VICTIM OF THAT NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE BEING RELEASED WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMENTS ARE RELEVANT. ACCURATE IN GERMANE TO THE BILLS BEFORE US. LET ME START BY SAYING THIS BUDGET THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET NOR THIS TRAILER BILL HAS TAKEN ANY ACTION TO QUOTE D. FUND THE POLICE THAT IS NOT IN THIS TRIBUTE. SECONDLY THE ARM. ACTIVE SERIOUS DISSUADING OF WITNESSES ARE FILED AS FELONIES NOT MISDEMEANORS AND SELL THAT STORY WOULD NOT BE GERMANE TO THIS TRAILER BILL. POINT OF CLARIFICATION THERE HAVE BEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE CDC ARE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE. TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR INMATES MANY MORE THAN JUST ONE HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED AND RAGICALLY WE'VE HAD FIFTY EIGHT INMATE DEATHS. AND I BELIEVE ONE OR TWO CVC ARE EMPLOYEE DEATH. AND SO FOR SOME PEOPLE PERHAPS NOT ALL WHO HAVE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS COLBERT NINETEEN CAN LEAD TO DEATH. AND SERIOUS LONG TERM AND- WITH REGARD TO ELDERLY PAROLE- THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN THE TOPIC OF NUMEROUS RESEARCH STUDY AND SEVERAL BILLS HEARD BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE. THE JUDICIAL APPOINTED RECEIVER ALL UPDATES THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND WILL UPDATE ANY MEMBER WHO WAS INTERESTED. ON WHAT HE SEES WHAT CORRECTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE WHY ARE HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE BEEN SO QUITE FRANKLY HIGH ON SINCE HE WAS APPOINTED MANY YEARS AGO NOW. AND SO I THINK THE ISSUE OF ELLE THE ELDERLY PAROLE IS REALLY TWO FOLD YES IT'S COST SAVINGS BECAUSE IT'S ASTRONOMICAL WHAT WE ARE PAYING PARTICULARLY FOR. THE ELDERLY- IN MAY TO HAVE SERIOUS CHRONIC CONDITIONS. ON AN A PART OF THE DIALOGUE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO RELEASE TO OUTSIDE APPROPRIATE CARE. ABOUT WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM WOULD QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL- FOR THEIR ONGOING HEALTH CONDITIONS. I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION ON PROVIDED BY- SUB FIVE. SHARE. THAT THE BILL ALLOWS JUDGES TO DO WHAT PROSECUTORS ALREADY CAN PROSECUTORS CAN EXTEND THE VERSION IN ANY CASE INCLUDING FELONIES JUDGES WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO DO SO FOR MISDEMEANORS. THE JUDGE WILL REQUIRE THE DEFENDANT TO COMPLETE THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT HE O SHE WOULD HAVE THEY BEEN TRADITIONALLY SENTENCE. AGAIN pSEX OFFENSES DV AND STOCKING. AGAIN IT ONLY APPLIES TO MISDEMEANORS NOT FELONY CHARGES AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN PRIOR HEARINGS. I'M SORRY I CAN'T ELABORATE ON THE COMMENT MADE WITH REGARD TO L. A. COUNTY MY HOME COUNTY BECAUSE I'M NOT. REALLY SURE WHAT THE REFERENCES TO I'M NOT SURE HOW WHAT RELATIONSHIP THIS HOUSE WITH WHATEVER SEVEN L. A. COUNTY.

ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL DEBATE OR DISCUSSION IS OR ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU I'M OUT OF PRESIDENT MEMBERS- THERE COULDN'T BE A MORE DIFFICULT YEAR TO DO A BUDGET. AND MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE BUDGET SHARE THE MEMBERS OF THE STAFF FOR THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE. TO BRING THE BUDGET THROUGH THESE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO LIBERTY TIMES. ON THE BILL BEFORE US MEMBERS. WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH FEE INCREASES BY FOURTEEN HEROES. IT'S THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHERE BOTH THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE TOGETHER HOLD JOINT HEARINGS HE CALLED THE SUNSET HEARINGS. IN THE COURSE OF REVIEWING THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS. WE LOOK AT THEIR FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCE. AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S JUSTIFICATION FOR INCREASING FEES. GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS YEAR. MANY OF SENATE HEARINGS DIDN'T TAKE PLACE. I WAS ASKED IN THE COURSE OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS. WEATHER DOT. HI IS CHAIR OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE WOULDBE SUPPORTIVE OF THESE HE INCREASES. THAT THE DEPARTMENTS AND BUREAUS REGULARLY REQUESTS. I INDICATED THAT I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF FEES THAT WERE INCREMENTAL THAT WOULD DEAL WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE FACING THIS YEAR. THAT THEY WERE IN DEFICIT SITUATIONS TO TRY TO PULL THEM OUT OF DEFICIT SITUATIONS. WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THE TRAILER BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. IS THAT THE BOARDS IN HEROES DIDN'T JUST ASK FOR THE INCREMENTAL. THEY ASKED FOR THE INCREMENTAL AND THEY ASKED FOR AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE FEES SUBSTANTIALLY. AT A HIGHER PLACE. I THINK THIS GOES OUTSIDE THE SCOPE. OF WHAT THIS BUDGET SHOULD BE PROVIDING I THINK IT GOES BEYOND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ASKING OF US- WE SHOULD BE DEALING WITH THESE THAT ARE SUNSET PROCESS WHICH HOPEFULLY IF CONDITIONS IMPROVE WOULD BEGIN. IN THE COMING YEAR SO RELUCTANTLY I'M NOT GONNA. VOTE ON THIS MEASURE TODAY. AND I WOULD DIE. GAIDAR'S BOARDS TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT. RAISING THE FEES TO MANY MANY FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE THE MONEY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS ACUPUNCTURISTS AND MANY OTHERS THAT WERE IN THIS IS THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU I HOPE THAT THEY'LL SHOW RESTRAINT SO WE CAN HAVE THEM DELIVERED TO PROCESS GO FORWARD AS IT NORMALLY DOES. SENATOR MELINDA IS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SO SENATOR GLAZER BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THE FEET ISSUE AND THIS BILL BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL FOR THE REST OF THE MEMBERS- FOR THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARD FIFTY APPLICATION IS GOING TO GO FROM SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. IT IS A VERY LARGE INCREASE. BE EXAMINATION FEE GOES TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS THE INITIAL LICENSE FEE GOES FROM THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE RENEWAL FEE GOES FROM THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THEN WE HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF NEW FEES WE HAVE THE SETS THE WALL LICENSE FEE RENEWAL FEE REPLACEMENT BE A FIFTY DOLLARS THERE'S AN ENDORSEMENT THE THERE'S APPROVAL AND RENEWAL FEEDERS IN CONTINUING EDUCATION APPLICATION OUR- FEET. FOR THE BOARD AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE. FOR MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST. THE APPLICATION AND RENEWAL FEES GOES FROM SEVENTY FIVE TO ONE FIFTY APPLICATION FOR LICENSURE FOR FROM ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH A CAP OF FIVE HUNDRED FOR CLINICAL EXAMINATION FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WITH THE CAP OF FIVE HUNDRED FOR INITIAL LICENSURE. ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED WITH THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TO TWO HUNDRED WITH A CAP OF FOUR HUNDRED. IF YOU FOR THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND ETHICS EXAMINATION. AT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS GETS A CAP OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. FOR EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST GOES FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO FIFTY WITH A CAP OF FIVE HUNDRED. INITIAL LICENSE FROM ONE FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED WITH THE CAP BEFORE IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON THESE FEES ARE. SOME OF THEM ARE DOING MORE THAN JUST DOUBLING OR TRIPLING AND QUADRUPLING AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE LUCKY TO EVEN HAVE A JOB RIGHT NOW AND- BY THE WAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. NOT ALLOW THE BOARD TO JUST. INCREASES FEES WHENEVER THEY SEE FIT OR IN SOME CASES DOUBLE THAT CANNOT AFFORD THIS THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS TO EVEN SUGGEST I DON'T KNOW. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD THINK THAT THIS OF ALL TIMES IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. OF ALL TIMES IS THAT THIS WOULD BE THE TIME WHERE WE SHOULD BE INCREASING FEES IN INSTITUTING NEW FEES FOR PEOPLE JUST TO BE ABLE TO WORK. YOU'RE LUCKY TO EVEN HAVE A JOB. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND A NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GORGEOUS. CLARIFICATION ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU CHECK IN RESIDENT WHICH IS HAPPY AND INQUIRY CLARIFICATION INQUIRY SENATOR BORCHERS YOUR CLARIFICATION IN FOR INCLUDE PLEASE. THANK YOU SIR THIS WOULD INCREASE THE FEE FOR THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW. I ASCRIBING HEALTH PRACTITIONERS SPENCER'S AND WHOLESALERS OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES DOES THAT INCLUDE FOLKS IN THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY AS WELL. CLOSE SHE SAID SHE WAS- SHE WILL ADDRESS SAID IN HER CLOTHES. IT'S A SIMPLE YES OR NO. SHE CAN ADDRESS IT IN HER CLOTHES IF THAT IS HER CHOICE UNLESS YOU PREFER OTHERWISE. AND I'M NOT TRYING TO AVERT THE QUESTION I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER IN FRONT OF ME SO I OFFERED TO ANSWER PROVIDED IN MY CLOTHES LIKE TO GET STAFF TO GET ME THE QUESTION TO GET ME THE ANSWER YOU'RE- REQUESTING. THAT'S WHY I'LL BE RESPONDING TO MY CLOSE. MAN PRESENT. WOULD IT BE A WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I RESERVE MY SPOT. TO FOLLOW UP AFTER SHE GET YOUR- QUESTION ANSWERED IT IS NOT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO ACCEPT THE QUESTION. SHE'S INDICATED SHE WILL ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION IN HER CLOTHES. WELL. HERE'S HERE'S MY DILEMMA SO LET'S LET'S ASSUME THAT ON THE FLOOR MANAGER FINDS OUT THAT MARIJUANA IS INCLUDED. ONE OF THE FOLKS THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY ARE INCLUDED IN THE CATEGORY OF DISPENSERS AND WHOLESALERS OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. I DON'T THEY ARE NOT LET'S ASSUME THEY ARE. WE JUST VOTED ONLY. MINUTES BACK ON EXEMPTING EIGHT TAX INCREASE FOR FOLKS IN THE MARIJUANA INDUSTRY. AND THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS SUPPORTED THAT THAT SUSPENSION OF A TAX INCREASE BUT NOW IF MARIJUANA IS INCLUDED IN THIS FEE INCREASE I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW FOLKS CAN RECONCILE THE TWO POSITIONS I THINK. BUT I'LL WAIT FOR THE ANSWER FROM THE FLOOR MANAGER AND I HOPE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES CD. EXENCIAL IRONY HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PURCHASES OR ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NON. NO HAN TO UP NO MIKE'S UP SENATOR MITCHELL YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO RESPOND OFF THE TOP FOR MY COLLEAGUES THIS BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE CANNABIS. TO CLARIFY ON THE PREVIOUS OF TRAILER BILL WE JUST VOTED ON I THOUGHT I MADE THE STATEMENT. IT DIDN'T ELIMINATE ALL TAX COLLECTIONS THAT ELIMINATED AN INCREASE OF THE TAXES FOR ONE YEAR PERIOD. I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUES PERSPECTIVE AND GOING DOWN THE LIST OF THE BOARDS AND WHAT THE RATE OF THE INCREASE WOULD BE ONE CRITICAL FACTOR WAS NOT SHARED. ALL OF THESE BOARDS ARE SELF FUNDING THEY DON'T HIT THE GENERAL FUND. FOR THEIR SELF FUNDING AND SOME OF THE ACTUAL BOARDS THAT WERE REFERENCED ARE VERY CLOSE TO BEING INSOLVENT ARE HAVING ZERO BALANCE. MANY OF THEM HAVE ALSO NOT. LEVERAGED INCREASES FOR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS. I APPRECIATE THE TIME NOW IS COMPLICATED BUT IT WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED IF THEY TAKE NO ACTION AND THEY ARE INSOLVENT. THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE FUND BALANCE OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION. BOMB OR NEGATIVE ONE MONTH IN RESERVE BY THE END OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE BOARD IS NOT RAISE FEES FOR THE MAJORITY OF THIS LICENSE CATEGORIES IN MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS PODIATRY THE BOARD OF THE ATTIC MEDICINE THE BOARD. ON AGAIN NEEDS A PERMIT FEE INCREASE TO ENSURE FUND'S SOLVENCY. THAT'S THE INCREASE WILL ONLY GENERATE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEY HAVE A FINE BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR TWO POINT THREE MONTHS IN RESERVE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THE CALIFORNIA ACUPUNCTURE BOARD IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A FUND BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SIX MONTHS IN RESERVE. THE FEE INCREASE WILL GENERATE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. THE CLIMBING TO EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX THOUSAND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND BEYOND. THAT BOARD IS NOT RAISE THE MAJORITY OF ITS FEES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. AND SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT THAT YES IT FEELS LIKE SOME OF THE FEES ARE DOUBLING. BUT THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED IN TWENTY AND IN SOME INSTANCES THIRTY YEARS THIS IS OUR EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BOARD STAY SOLVENT THEY SERVE A CRITICAL ROLE IN OVERSIGHT AND PROTECTION OF THOSE LICENSEES. AGAIN THEY ARE SELF FUNDED WITH ALL FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I'M ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

TRYING TO CALL THEM EVERY HOUR AND NOT GETTING THROUGH NOT GETTING A CALL BACK NOT GETTING AN EMAIL BACK HAVING TO REACH OUT TO THEIR LEGISLATORS TO TRY TO HELP THEM- MAKE SOME HEADWAY ALL FOR MONEY THAT THEY ARE OWED THAT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT ACCESS. THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN BUT BECAUSE EDT HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND- WE KNOW WE WANT TO HELP EDT SOLVE WHATEVER PROBLEM IT IS THAT THEY HAVE BUT OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE PROBLEMS ARE UNLESS WE ALLOW. AND AUDITS WHICH- I GUESS NOT ALL OF US AGREE SHOULD HAPPEN BUT THIS THIS BILL JUST DOESN'T SATISFY THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS- SO I WOULD JUST ASK AND HOPEFULLY. THERE ANY OF THE OTHER BY TO LIKE TO ALSO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS BILL I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT PEOPLE REALLY TAKE PAUSE AND THINK ABOUT. WHAT IS BEING PASSED IN THIS BILL AND WHETHER OR NOT IT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP CALIFORNIANS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND IN A WAY THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED RIGHT NOW THANK YOU THANK. YOU CENTER MELINDA CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. AB RIGHT TO WOULD LIKE TO JUST TAKE A FEW COMMENTS AND- ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE SAID- THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS THAT- REPUBLICAN TEXAS REQUESTED AN- AUDIT ON THE EDT WHEN ALL THESE PROBLEMS WORK- TAKING PLACE- MONTHS AGO. WHEN WE'D LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID- PHONE CALLS WERE COMING INTO OUR OFFICE. THOUSANDS OF CALLS- PEOPLE HAVING TO WAIT PEOPLE HAVING NO RESPONSES. PEOPLE HAVING TO MAKE MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS BEFORE THEY EVEN GOT A LIVE PERSON TO RETURN THEIR CALL- MY OFFICE WAS INUNDATED WITH CALLS WE REACHED OUT TO THE EDT- WE- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT- THESE BENEFITS ARE PAID. AGAIN THESE BENEFITS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M REQUIRES THESE BENEFITS TO BE ADMINISTERED TO. THAT ARE STRUGGLING THAT DON'T HAVE A JOB- AND- THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT SPENDING ARE THERE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT MANY. ISSUE TO THEM. 87% OF THAT WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS. AND CALIFORNIA HAS SEVERELY FAILED AGAIN THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS JUST A COME OUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. WAS AN AUDIT IN THE PAST- THAT AUDITED DVD D. FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS. AND IT'S CAME IT CAME BACK AND IT DETERMINED THAT THAT WAS INADEQUATE AND DEFICIENT. AND YET WE DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. AND NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC WHEN- ARE AT CONSTITUENTS. I DESPERATELY NEED THESE RESOURCES TO KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE PAY THEIR RENT. BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT THE GOVERNOR'S MANDATED SHUT DOWN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GO TO WORK THEIR- FOOD ON THEIR TABLE AND THIS IS THE ONLY. THAT THEY HAVE THE TO PAY BILLS AND THE EDT IS STILL NOT PER. AND I THINK THAT TO PASS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND NOT INCLUDE THE AMENDMENTS FROM MY GOOD REPUBLICAN NAVY VETERAN THAT SUBMITTED THOSE OF AMENDMENTS- IS UNACCEPTABLE I THINK THOSE AMENDMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN SO THAT THE EDT WOULD BE I DID. I THINK THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY CONSTITUENT CALLS AND- AUDITING THE EDT WOULD BE A FIRST STEP FORWARD I HAVE FOR THE LIFE OF ME DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD NOT ALLOW MISS LINDA'S AMENDMENTS TO GO FORWARD SO THAT WE COULD AUDIT THE EDT IN INCLUDED IN THIS. BILL AND I IT JUST IT MAKES NO SENSE YOU'VE GOT TO CARE ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE HURTING THAT ARE RECEIVING THEIR CHECKS THAT- DDT IS FAILING TO PAY YOU LOOK AT THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SAID. AB FIVE THAT WE HAVE THAT THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS BUILDING IN MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE HAVE VOTED FOR TO ELIMINATE THEIR JOBS AND THEN ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WERE PROVIDED TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT MONEY IS STILL NOT BEING PUT OUT. THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THE LAST ESTIMATE THAT WE HAD WAS OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEEDED AND WE ARE MONTHS INTO THIS PANDEMIC AND MONTHS WITHOUT PEOPLE WITHOUT A JOB IN MONTHS WITH THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T WORK THEY'RE FORCED TO STAY AT HOME THEIR FORCE NOT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. FOR THEIR FAMILY PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND- A SIMPLE REQUEST. AND MISS LINDA THIS WAS TO AUDIT THE EDT INCLUDING A LETTER THAT REPUBLICANS DID PREVIOUSLY DENIED- AND THEN THE AMENDMENTS NOT EVEN. I'M BEING ACCEPTED. I THINK THAT SOME ANY. AND I THINK WITH THE ET. I TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICTS PAID. THIS BILL SHOULD NOT BE FORWARD SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK- FOR A NO VOTE.

SENATOR PROBABLY ERA THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT A CRITICAL MEASURE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA RENTERS AND LANDLORDS FIRST LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE CO AUTHORS LEADERSHIP THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADVOCATES FOR THE EXTENSIVE NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AS YOU KNOW THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S EMERGENCY RULE ONE WILL BE RESCINDED TOMORROW AND TENDANCE ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE AT RISK OF EVICTION THAT IS WHY WE MISSED OUT TODAY TO ESTABLISH NEW PROTECTIONS TO GET US THROUGH THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO PREVENT A WAVE OF MASS EVICTIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WITH NO CLEAR END IN SIGHT. THE YOUNG PRINCE PRESIDENT AND JOB LOSS EXPERIENCED BY TENANTS HAVE LEFT MANY LANDLORDS STRUGGLING TO CATCH UP TO COVER THE RENTS AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY HAVE THIS BURDEN IS ESPECIALLY HARD FOR SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO DEPEND ON RENTAL IN INCOME TO COVERING COVER THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. TO GET OUT OF THIS EMERGENCY WE MUST TAKE WE MUST PROVIDE MEANINGFUL RENT RELIEF TO HELP MAKE LANDLORDS HOLE WHILE SHE'LL EAT FIELDING TENANTS FROM TAKING ON MOUNTAINS OF DEBT FROM THE MISSED PAYMENTS FOR TENANTS AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT SET UP A MULTI PHASE APPROACH THE FIRST PHASE FOCUSES ON THE INITIAL PANDEMIC PERIOD WHICH WAS. DECLARED MARCH THIRTEENTH THROUGH TOMORROW AND IT PROVIDED A TEN A CANNOT BE EVICTED FOR RENT MISTER IN THIS TIME THE NEXT PHASE IS THE TRANSITION PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO JANUARY THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ONE ATTENDANT IS IT IS REQUIRE AIRED DURING THIS PHASE TO PAY IT. 20% OF THE RENT EACH MONTH DURING THIS PERIOD AND THE REST OF THE RENT OWED CANNOT BE THE BASIS FOR AN EVICTION. IF I TENANTS IS UNABLE TO PAY 25% OF THE RENT DO THE NORMAL ADDICTION PERSIK PROCEEDINGS CAN HAPPEN IN FEBRUARY. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE PAST DUE RENT IS STILL OWED TO THE LANDLORD THIS RENT IS CONVERTED TO A CONSUMER DEBT. AND CAN CAN BE COLLECTED IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LANDLORDS TO RECOVER WHAT THEY'RE OWED AND EASIER FOR TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO GO INTO COURT WITHOUT THE HIGH COST OF LITIGATION. TO QUALIFY FOR EVICTION PROTECTIONS AFTER SEPTEMBER FIRST TENANTS MUST ALSO ATTEST THAT THEY EXPERIENCED A HIGH. EIGHT COVERT NINETEEN RELATED HARDSHIP BY SIGNING A DECLARATION UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. HI INCOME TENANTS MUST MAKE AN ADDITIONAL THE- THEY MUST PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENT DOCUMENTATION OF HARDSHIP IN THAT HIGH INCOME TENANTS OR TENANTS EARNING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARSA YEAR. THE BILL ALSO PROTECTS THE AUTHORITY OF EXISTING LOCAL ORDINANCES SO TENANTS IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE MORE PROTECTIVE LOCAL ORDINANCES CAN STILL RELY ON THOSE PROTECTIONS UNTIL THEY EXPIRED. FINALLY FOR LANDLORDS THIS BILL EXTENDS THE HOMEOWNER BILL OF RIGHTS ANTI FORECLOSURE PROTECTIONS TO SMALL LANDLORDS AND PUT IN PLACE CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURES. TO REQUIRE BANKS TO FOLLOW APPLICABLES FEDERAL GUIDELINES REGARDING BORROWER OPTIONS AFTER OFFERING COVERED. NINETEEN RELATED FOR PARENTS. EIGHT THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT IS A TEMPORARY SOLUTION. IF WE ALL HAD A CRYSTAL BALL WE'D LOOK AT IT AND WE KNOW WHEN THE COVERAGE- PANDEMIC IS GOING TO END. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY WHEN ARE PEOPLE GOING TO GET BACK TO WORK NONE OF THAT IS POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME. SO AFTER THIS BILL IS SIGNED OUR WORK STILL CONTINUES TO PREPARE FOR THE NEW YEAR THIS BILL REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WERE AT THE TABLE WITH THOSE. TO LOOK AT WAYS TO DIRECT FUTURE FEDERAL AND STATE MONIES INTO RELIEF FOR TENANTS LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AND I BOUGHT. THANK YOU CENTER W. AERO THE BILL RECESSION. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BRADFORD MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR BARNABY THREE. I'M SORRY PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IT IS YES WELL THEN WE GOT TO THE ACCURATE ONE I WOULD LIKE TO- CALL FOR A REPUBLICAN COCCUS. IF THAT MEETS WITH YOUR APPROVAL. YEAH OKAY. YEAH BOB SENATOR WHAT WE WOULD DO A PROPOSED AND WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE PROTOCOL ISSUES IN THE MIDDLE OF HER PRESENTATION LET'S HAVE HER PRESENT HAVE THE DEBATE WENT ON TO FINISHED. I'M SORRY JUST STARTED AND WE JUST STARTED THE DEBATER SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS WE WILL HAVE THE DEBATE IN THE DISCUSSION AND THEN IF YOU LIKE TO CALL A CAUCUS WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE BODY. THAT WOULD BE FINE ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISCUSSION ON A BILL IT IS GENUINE- GENERALLY NOT APPROPRIATE TO CALL FOR CAUCUS IN THE MIDDLE OF A DISCUSSION. YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT BUT WE WER INFORMED THAT THIS MATTER WAS GOING TO BE BROUGHT UP AFTER DINNER SO THIS CAUGHT US BY SURPRISE. JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE. MADAM PRESIDENT. YES SENATOR BREAUX FOR WHAT PURPOSE AT FOR PURPOSE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE CAUCUS WOULD BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OR LESS IT'S JUST FOR A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON THE NEW AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THEN WE WILL BE BACK TO VIGOROUSLY HELD BY DEBATE AND DISCUSS THIS BILL. THAT'S WHEN WE WOULD REVIEW APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT THANK YOU CENTER GROVE IF YOU JUST WAIT ONE MINUTE WE'RE TRYING TO BE ACCOMMODATING BUT THERE ARE ALSO RULES OF THE HOUSE AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE LEADERSHIP AND WE'LL GET RIGHT BACK TO YOU. BUT SENATOR BORDER SENATOR GROVE- AFTER DISCUSSION WITH LEADERSHIP- THEY'VE AGREED THE CHU MAY GO AHEAD AND HAVE A FIVE MINUTE CAUCUS AND THEN WE WILL CONTINUE. WITH THE DEBATE AND DISCUSSION. SO FIVE MINUTES AND THEN WE WILL BE BACK. RECONVENING AT. THREE OO ONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. UNDER DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ON FILE ITEM. SEVENTY FOUR. COLLEAGUES BACK ON THE FLOOR PLEASE. SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS JOIN AUTHOR OF THIRTY EIGHT I AM HONORED TO JOIN ASSEMBLY PERSON CHIU RAMON AND OF MY CONGRESSMAN MY SENATOR CAFIERO. THIS MEASURE IS SIMPLY A SIX MONTH BRIDGE FOR BOTH TENANTS AND LANDLORDS THIS BILL BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION IS THE END ALL BE ALL SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IT'S A COMPROMISE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS CAN SUPPORT. AND WILL KEEP BOTH TENANTS AND LANDLORDS VIABLE IN A FLOAT FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. THIS IS ON PRESIDENT CRISIS AS WE ALL MUST AGREE UPON. THERE'S OVER ONE MILLION HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE THAT HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS TO THE CALL THE NINETEEN. THE ONE IN FORTY CALIFORNIANS BETWEEN ONE AND SEVEN RUNNERS THERE WERE MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MAKE RENT PAYMENTS PRIOR TO COVERT NINETEEN. THIRD QUARTER RESULTS HALL SOULS ARE BLACK AND BROWN RUNNERS. MANY OF THEM ARE CENTRAL WORKERS ARE FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS WORK. THE SAME INEQUITIES APPLIES TO SMALL LANDLORDS AGAIN SOME OF THOSE ARE OUR FRONT LINE A CENTRAL WORKERS EVEN SOME MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AS WELL AS STAFF ARE SMALL LANDLORDS ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE. THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS THE MAJORITY OF STRUGGLING HOUSEHOLDS ARE TENANTS OF SMALL LANDLORDS MANY OF WHOM ARE ALSO PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT IS TIME FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO ACT NOW TO HELP BRIDGE THIS. CRISIS THIS BILL PROTECTS TENANTS STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF COLD IT ON NINETEEN WITHOUT WRITING THEM A BLANK CHECK IT ALSO HELPS AGAIN THOSE SMALL LANDLORDS BOTH WILL PURSUE RENT PAYMENTS AND POTENTIAL FORBEARANCE. THIS BY NO MEANS IS A HAND OUT JUST A HAND AGAIN DURING THIS CRISIS IS DIRECTLY WHAT IS NEEDED AT THIS TIME AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD ANY OTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR. SEEING NONE. BUT THE SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT. WE HAD A LENGTHY LENGTHY DISCUSSION ON THIS MATTER IN JUDICIARY- I THINK THE FIRST TIME YOU PUT IN ME WAS LIKE FIVE OR SIX HOURS I IN ITS INITIAL ITERATION AND OBVIOUSLY MUCH SHORTER ONE. SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT WERE BROUGHT UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION SOMEWHAT TOLERABLE AND I THINK THE FLOOR MANAGER SAID IT BEST THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS ALL THE ISSUES. IN THE CONTINUUM. BETWEEN A RENDER HEY AT LORDE. HE MMHM RECIMO SENATE HILLARY SHE WROTE WITH CENTER BORCHERS. DO WE HAVE HIM BACK. ALRIGHT YOU YOU FROZE THERE FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS. SO THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN REAL MEANINGFUL WAYS BETWEEN THE LANDLORD OR THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY AND THE CREDITOR THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN THERE THAT- ARE DESIGNED TO BE HELPFUL. TRYING TO ALLOW FOR THE 25% ON HUMANS BY THE RENTER- ALLOWING THE OTHER INJECTION BASIE'S TO EXIST LONG AS IT'S NOT BASED ON CODE. THAT INCOME. THAT WILL BE OF PERJURY AFTER DAVID NOW EXISTS WE'RE IN A RENTER HAS TO IDENTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO PAY AND PURSUITS PRESUMABLY THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS BASED. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN IS. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT BETWEEN NOW. AND THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO HELP. BIRDS THE ONES ARE CURING THE NOTE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THERE IS LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT IS HELPFUL AND INSTRUCTIVE THAT. WOULD ALLOW A BANK TO. ENGAGE WITH A BORROWER IN IN WAYS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THERE'S NO REAL LEGAL TEETH IN IT IN THE DINNER CAMPING ON WE KNOW THAT THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE. CONTRACT PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES SO THIS THING IS FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS. THE REASON WHY I SUPPORTED IT IN JUDICIARY IS BECAUSE IT BECAME BETTER IN THE PROCESS BUT I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. ONE IS THAT WE- ENDEAVOR TO CREATE A TAX CREDITS. WHEREBY AID LANDLORD WHOSE ONLY BEEN BEING. WHICH ONLY COLLECTED. 25% OF THE RED BUT HE'S STILL ALL GET ON THE TERMS OF THE LOAN THAT THERE BE A TAX CREDIT SO THIS CAN BE WRITTEN OFF CALIFORNIA TAXES AND I THINK THAT IS. TERRIBLY IMPORTANT. THE SECOND THAT THIS ENDS IN JANUARY. IT CAN'T GO BEYOND THAT NINETY NINE I KNOW THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO WANT TO SEE THIS GO ON FOR. YOU KNOW THE DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC OR THE END OF THE DECLARE STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR. REALISTICALLY UNTIL EVERYONE IS ECONOMICALLY BACK ON THEIR FEET BUT THAT IS. I DON'T BELIEVE SUSTAINABLE. I SUPPORTING THIS IS BECAUSE- ALL THE FOLKS CAME TOGETHER IN IN IN. IN GOOD FAITH TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROPOSALS THAT WILL GET US THROUGH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I WON'T SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION WHEN THIS IF THIS COMES BACK IN JANUARY FOR AN EXTENSION I WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE SUPPORTING IT DOWN BUT WE HAVE A PURITY TIME WITHIN WHICH WE HAVE TO MARSHAL THE ENERGIES AND THE RESOURCES. THAT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND FIND WAYS TO BE HELPFUL TO THE LANDLORDS AND THE BORROWERS BECAUSE IF WE CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH WE MAY HAVE SHORT TERM SURVIVAL BUT LIQUIDITY IS GOING TO DRY UP MEANING THAT CREDITORS KNOWING. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PROPERTIES NEW BORROWERS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD MEETING MUCH MORE CASH DOWN. OR MORE UNFAVORABLE RATES SO THE HOUSING ELEMENT MEDIUM AND LONG TERM IS GOING TO HURT US AS CALIFORNIANS IF WE DON'T TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION IMMEDIATELY. OVER THESE NEXT FEW MONTHS SO I KNOW THE YOU KNOW REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON THIS ISSUE AND I'M A PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS KIND OF PERSON. AND I REPRESENT A LOT OF FOLKS THAT DO YOU HAVE. PROPERTIES ABOVE THE FOUR UNITS. AND ABOUT A LOT OF PHONE CALLS- BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT EXEMPTION ONLY THE FOUR UNITS IN UNDER OR- AND IT'S NOT AGGREGATE REACHED IT'S TO ME IT'S NOT BY EIGHT PM IT'S AGGREGATE SO IF YOU HAVE TO. IF YOU HAVE THREE DUPLEXES YOU'RE OUT IT'S AGGREGATE IN THAT SITUATION. SO I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO OTHER FOLKS TO CHIME IN IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSIONS BY DO YOU WANT TO EXTEND MY- MY RESPECTING CONGRADULATIONS TO YOU- THE SENATOR FROM SALINAS WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS AS A CO AUTHOR AND IS DONE A YEOMAN'S JOB OF TROLLING TO CRAFT TOGETHER SOMETHING IN VERY IMPERFECT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE MAKE THIS HAPPEN BUT WE IMMEDIATELY TAKE ACTION TO MAKE THIS TOLERABLE IN SUSTAINABLE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THIS CAN'T SURVIVE PAST JANUARY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BORDERS US SENATOR GROW AND MULLIN I SEE YOUR HAND I'M GOING TO GO TO SENATOR JACKSON AND THEN SENATOR GROUP WILL COME BACK TO YOU AND MELINDA SENATOR JACKSON YES THANK YOU I'M GONNA SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY- WE HAD A SIX AND A HALF HOUR HEARING ON THIS WE HAD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE CALLING IN TENANTS WHO ARE DESPERATE- WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO LOSE THE ONLY PLACE THEY KNOW IT WILL BE OUT ON THE STREETS. WE ALSO HAVE SMALL LANDLORDS WHO ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR PROPERTIES. TO FORECLOSURE. BUT WE NEVER DID GET THE- TO COME IN AND TO BE A PLAYER IN THIS TO PARTICIPATE. AND SO AS WE GO FORWARD I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SIMPLY SUGGEST BECAUSE I WON'T BE HERE- THAT WE AS WE TALK ABOUT A RECOVERY HERE CERTAINLY WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP. CALIFORNIA DOESN'T PRINT MONEY CAN'T PRINT MONEY WE HAVE TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME IN AND BE HELPFUL. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE WILL GET. THE LEADERSHIP THE SO CALLED LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON. TO STEP UP BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN CREATED BY A FAILURE IN ADDRESSING A PANDEMIC THAT HAS PUT TO SO MANY PEOPLE AT RISK. AND KILLED OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND AMERICANS SO- I BELIEVE. THE EFFORT HERE HAS BEEN A AGAIN THE YEOMAN'S EFFORT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR IN THIS WEIRD FASHION SOMETHING THAT WE HOPED. WAS GOING TO SUSTAIN US THROUGH AND HOPE WE HAVE A VACCINE AND A CURE FOR THIS PANDEMIC BUT IN THE MEANTIME- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PASS. A IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. AND THERE ARE SO MANY MORE GROUPS THAT HAVE TO STEP UP AND OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE ONE OF-THOSE PARTICIPANTS. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER FOR THE- OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS ON THIS MISSION THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON CENTER GROW WE'RE GOING TO YOU. PRESIDENT I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR AND I'LL JUST BE BRIEF. SORRY WE'RE CHANGING PRESIDING OFFICERS US IN A COPY ARE WE TAKE QUESTION ABSOLUTELY PLEASE PROCEED CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU AM I GET CALLING FROM SALINAS IS THERE IS THERE A SEVERABILITY CLAUSE IN THIS BILL. MEETING MEANING THAT IF THIS BILL IS CHALLENGE WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGED IF IT WAS CHALLENGED IN COURT AND IT MOST LIKELY WILL WILL THE MORTGAGE PIECE A STATE BUT THE IN THE- THIS THE PART THAT SAYS YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY RENT THAT COULD BE SEPARATED AND IT WOULD IT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE- VALID IN THE BILL MOVING FORWARD BUT THE MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE OF THE MORTGAGE PIECE WE DIDN'T GET TO BE SEPARATED. GOOD QUESTION- THERE THERE IS THERE IS THIS I'M I'M TOLD THERE IS A SEVER ABILITY WE HAD IT IN OUR BILL AND I ASSUMED IT'D BEEN MOVED OVER AND IT WAS AND IT IS SO THAT YES TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. I AM SO. THE CAN. THAT I HAVE WITH THIS AGAIN I AGREES MY- FROM FRESNO THAT. SENATE AND ARE DESPERATE RIGHT NOW THERE'S INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DESPERATE AND THERE SAT PEOPLE THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THEIR HOMES BUT WE ALSO HAVE SMALL BUSINESS HOUSING PROVIDERS- THAT WANT TO PROVIDE SAFE SHELTER AND THEY HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY ERODED. I HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE CALLED MY OFFICE AND THEIR SMALL HOUSING PROVIDERS- AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT'S AGGREGATE IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT TO. YOU KNOW LIKE THREE DUPLEXES LIKE HE SAID IT'S A TOTAL OF AN AGGREGATE AND- I HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE LIKE RETIREES AND THEY HAVE THREE LITTLE HOUSES ARE THREE LITTLE COMPLEXES THAT HOUSE TWO OR THREE- RENTERS IN EACH IN EACH UNIT OR NOT EACH UNIT BUT THREE UNITS. AND THAT'S THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME IT'S WHAT THEY'VE- SAVED FOR IT'S WHAT THEY PAID FOR IT AND IT'S THEIR RETIREMENT- INCOME TO AND BE AT LANDLORDS IN. SO WITHOUT THEM BEING ABLE TO COLLECT THE RENTS THAT PUTS THEM IN A VERY HARD POSITION AT NIGHT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT A CHALLENGE THAT WOULD ELIMINATE. THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACT TO THIS BILL AND STILL HAVE INDIVIDUALS NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY RENT. A LOT OF THINGS ARE ASIDE FROM RENT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE MAINTENANCE ISSUES THEY'RE SUPER HORNETS ON THE BOOKS FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN AND- SAFE AND SAFE AND SECURE SHELTER- HOMES THAT ARE RENTED. AND THOSE THINGS COST MONEY EVERY MONTH THAT THE LANDLORDS IN THE SMALL LANDLORDS ARE. ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR WHETHER IT'S A ROOF REPAIR WATER REPAIR- YOU KNOW SPRINKLER REPAIR. ALL OF THOSE THINGS COST MONEY TO USE SO I REALIZE THAT WE'RE ALL MOVING FORWARD TO TRY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE SOLVED. AND BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS THE% WAY. WE SHOULD SOLVE IT SOMEONE LISTEN TO THAT ARE FLOOR DEBATE AND. THEM AND THEN MAKE A DECISION AT THE END BUT I. YOUR HARD WORK ON THE BILL I'M I'M CALLING FROM SALINAS. AND I KNOW YOU DID WORK HARD AND I KNOW HE REACHED OUT TO MANY- OF THE- STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD AND IT. HAD BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE- ARE SMALL LANDLORDS AND TO HAVE. SOME OF OUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS COME UP SHORT. AND BECAUSE THEY STILL MAY HAVE- BILLS THAT ARE OWED TO THE BANK AND THEN. YOU KNOW THE BANK HAS A PROMISE NOT TO. TAKE PROPERTY AWAY FROM THEM SO I'M I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AS WELL BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT'LL AFFECT PEOPLE IN THERE. THAT ARE RENTING THE PROPERTIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SHARE MY THOUGHTS THANK. YOU CENTER GROVE. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU THANK MAD BRO MAY I TO. OF THE FLOOR MANAGER. WE ACCEPT THOSE QUESTIONS CENTERED I WILL I WILL ACCEPT THOSE QUESTION CAN. THE SOONER CABALLERO- TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS WHAT IT IS THAT. THE DIGITAL COUNCIL'S INVOLVEMENT IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S INVOLVEMENT STARTS IMMEDIATELY AND THEY SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR THIRTY DAYS TO BE ABLE TO. WORK ON THE ON THE DETAILS OF HOW THEY WILL IMPLEMENT THIS SO THEIR THEIR ACTION- IT'S BASICALLY OCTOBER FOURTH I BELIEVE IS THE DATE THAT THAT THEY WILL BE READY. AND CAN. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS BILL WERE NOT APPROVED WHAT WOULD THEY DO EVERY DAY COMMANDEER THIS WHOLE ISSUE. BUT WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WOULD DO IS THAT THEIR THEIR ORDER WOULD END AND- LANDLORDS COULD START TO EVICT TENANTS FOR NON PAYMENT OF RENT. OKAY THEN. I WANT TO THANK YOU THIS THIS IS A MASSIVE BUILD SO JUNE BECAUSE I HAVE. ENLARGE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS. BILL COULD YOU GIVE ME THE ELEVATOR SPEECH THAT I'LL NEED TO. PRESENTS IF I VOTE FOR THIS BILL. I'LL DO THAT I'M SURE SHE'S ME I'M NOT SURE THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION PERHAPS YOU CAN RESPOND IN YOUR CLOTHES I WILL THANK YOU. HI YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION BUT WE DO NEED A LITTLE LEVITY AT TIMES THOSE OF US WHO ARE IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT EVERY NOW AND THEN GETTING A JOE CAL STANDS OUT. LET ME BEGIN BY ECHOING THE CONCERNS RAISED BY OUR LEADER REGARDING THE BALANCE THAT SEEMS TO BE ABSENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE. SMALL MOM AND POP. AND SOARED. OF NATURE SIDE THEY NOT ONLY FACE. LOSING POSITION. ON THEIR IF THEY CAN'T MEET THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. THAT THEY ARE REALLY ARE AT RISK OF LOSING OF THEIR INCOME. A PUTTING THEM IN A GRAVE GRAVE SITUATION THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A REAL BALANCE OR ONE THAT'S ADDRESSED. PERHAPS THERE WAS THAT MANY OF US ARE NOT SHOULD PREACH TO THOSE SEVEN HOUR DEBATE. THAT WENT ON IN JUDICIARY I REALISED THE COOL KIDS NINE SITUATION NINETEEN SITUATION DOES IMPACT. THE ABILITY- FOR A BROAD COMMUNICATION IN HIM DOWN DEBATE. BUT THIS BILL CERTAINLY LACKED THAT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTING ABOUT CONTINGENT THAT'S OUT THERE VERY. VERY WORRIED ABOUT SO THERE'S YOU THERE INVEST THAT BE LAW. AND WHILE THE BANKS HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED WE ARE HOPING THAT THEY WILL. CERTAINLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ADDRESS THESE ARE VERY HUGE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES IN LIFE THREATENING. SITUATIONS THAT CAN APPROACH OUR SENIOR SO. I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHO HAVE SPENT MANY MANY. HOURS SENDING US. ALL LETTERS THIS AND WHAT MIGHT BE ADDRESSED FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A NEW TO SOMEWHERE NEAR IN THE- SO I DO TO THE CALL THAT I IN. WITHOUT INCOME DURING COLD NINETEEN YEAH THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU NEED TO SHOW THAT SO YOU START GETTING A PAYCHECK. ARE THAT YOU WERE LAID OFF ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS SEEMS TO ME TO BE DATA THAT SHOULD BE BACKING UP. YOUR PRODUCE IS BEEN TAKEN HERE ARE NEEDS FAST SO ALL RIGHT WILL GOING FORWARD THERE'S A LITTLE MORE CONSIDERATION GIVEN. TO THOSE WHO ARE BASICALLY- YOU HAVE TO DO AS MUCH AS THOSE WHO ARE YET IN OUR APARTMENTS AND POTENTIALLY FACING OBJECTION- GOING BACK AND NOT. I GUESS LEADING IT TO. BUT IF YOU DE TO BE DURING THE DAY THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING ORDER LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE WOULD FIND OURSELVES. IN A SITUATION THAT HAS SUCH DEPTH IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO JUST GET BY DURING THIS VERY VERY CHALLENGING TIME. I WILL BE A NO VOTE. AND IT WILL BE A STRONG NO VOTE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS REALLY CONSIDERS ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AGAIN. AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S BEEN WRONG WITH A LOT OF LEGISLATION THAT SPONSORED HERE RECENTLY. WHEN I'M FINISHED WITH THIS- AND YOU TAKE A VOTE I WOULD LIKE A MOMENT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE. TO SPEAK AS A FORMER LEADER. RIGHT NOW LEADER EMERITUS OF OUR CAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU UGH IN FURTHER. OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NON CENTER COVER YEAR YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU FOR ALL THE COMMENTS THAT THAT ARE ALL OF THE SENATORS WHO SPOKE ON ON THIS BILL- IT DEFEATED WHAT YOU HAVE SAID IS NOT. IS NOT. IS NOT NEW INFORMATION THESE HAVE BEEN EXACTLY THAT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT. THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING OVER THE PAST. COUPLE OF MONTHS OVER THE POTENTIAL SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A- BE TWO. ONE THAT WAS- A SENATE BILL AND ONE THAT WAS IT AND ASSEMBLY BILL AND IT WAS WITH THE WITH THE- PARTICIPATION OF THE GOVERNOR SO THAT WE KNOW THAT WHATEVER IT IS WE PASS. HERE TODAY WILL BE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE GOVERNOR AS WELL. BUT BUT BUT LET ME LET ME GIVE YOU A GOOD NOTE. IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PANDEMIC. WITH BAD NEWS IS THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING OR WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY VERY LITTLE. THE INFORMATION WE'VE RECEIVED FROM- THE DATA COLLECTORS IS IT PEOPLE HAVE CONTINUED TO PAY THE RENT. THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR LANDLORDS AND THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT. AND SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO SET UP A FRAMEWORK GOING FORWARD THAT WILL ALLOW LANDLORDS. TO BE ABLE TO- TO CONTINUE TO TAKE RENT. ON THE MINIMUM THAT HAS TO BE PAID IS AT LEAST 25% WITH THE UP A NOTE AND UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY AND THE MEANS TEST IS THOSE OVER. EARNING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND HAVE TO SHOW. SOME KIND OF. LETTER FROM THEIR EMPLOYER OR SOME KIND OF PROOF THAT THEY BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. AND THE WHOLE. THE WHOLE POINT OF DOING THIS THIS WAY. IS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A WE NEED TO SET UP. THEIR CONTINUING WORK AND THE KINDS OF THINGS ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW- WHETHER WE DO A TAX CREDIT WHETHER THE STATE BUDGET HAS MONEY TO BE ABLE TO USE AS COLLATERAL TO BE ABLE TO- ENCOURAGED THE BANKS TO DO SOMETHING WHETHER WE GET FEDERAL FUNDS INTEREST MLS- ACT. AND THEN ALL SO THAT THERE ISN'T AS NEVER BEEN A BETTER. TO REACH FIND. MORTGAGES AND THERE'S THE POTENTIAL FOR THE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO GO AND TALK TO THEIR BANKS. AND TO BE ABLE TO WORK OUT SOMETHING WHICH IS PART OF A FOR A PHOTO OF A FORBEARANCE FRAMEWORK SO- THAT'S MY ELEVATOR SPEECH IS IT. WHAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO TAKE ACTION RIGHT NOW BECAUSE FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. ENDING UP ON THE STREET AT A TIME WHEN OUR HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN THE HIGHEST AND- AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WHEN PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE STAYING IN THEIR HOMES. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTENABLE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN AND THIS BILL WILL. GIVE US THE FRAMEWORK TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT TENANTS. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO THE NEW YEAR AND THAT AND TO HAVE. HOPEFULLY HAVE COME UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION BY JANUARY. AYE WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN AT THE TABLE AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR IS AS WELL SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

OUR STATE LEGISLATURE IS A NATIONAL LEADER IN A STAB WISHING THE COUNTRY'S STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS BUT IF COMPANIES CAN INVADE THEIR OBLIGATIONS AS EMPLOYERS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE THESE LAWS ARE WORTHLESS.

AND THEIR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IS WITH THE CUSTOMER WHO IS HAS COMMISSIONED IN THIS PIECE OF ARTWORK NOT WITH THE OWNER OF THE TATTOO PARLOR. THESE ARTISTS ALREADY GET FORGOTTEN AND ARE OFTEN NOT TREATED LIKE THE FINE ARTISTS THAT THEY ARE SO WHILE I DO AGREE THAT THE DEFINITION OF FINE ARTISTS SHOULD NOW COVER THEM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NO.

BUT I THINK YOU CAN TELL HOW STRONGLY WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY FIVE. ESPECIALLY IN THE KOBE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTING OUR STRUCTURAL. CHALLENGES FOR STATE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SOMEONE. LIVELIHOOD TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND TO HAVE THE PERSONAL CHOICE. MY OF MY AMENDMENT IS TWO EXAMS FOR. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A FRANCHISEE IN THE FRANCHISE OR SO THIS LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. THERE'S STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE THAT. THE CURRENT AB FIVE RULES. AND ALSO THE DYNAMICS DECISION- IT COULD CREATE SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS WITH WHAT EXACTLY A FRANCHISE IS IMAGINE MCDONNELL'S OR JERSEY MIKE'S ARE SEVEN ELEVEN. THERE'S CONCERN THAT WIN A CORPORATE MOTHER SHIP ALLOWS FOR A FRANCHISE. THAT BB FIVE WOULD BE USED EFFECTIVELY USED TO FORCIBLY CREATE A RELATIONSHIP WHEREBY IT THE FRANCHISE OWNER IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE END THE EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE FRANCHISE ITSELF COLLECTIVELY BE CLASSIFIED AS GIVES MORE EASE OF THE CORPORATE ENTITY A LARGE CORPORATE ME SO BECAUSE A MCDONALD'S MOTHER SHIP OR SEVEN ELEVEN. THIS SEND FUNDAMENTALLY DISMANTLE THE FRANCHISE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR INTENDED. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR INTENDED TO DROUGHT TO ALLOW THIS TO BE DRAWN INTO THE DRAGNET OF EIGHTY FIVE.

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY SENATOR NELSON SAT SEVEN CENTER NIELSEN. AND THAT THIS AMENDMENT RELATES SPECIFICALLY TO THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. AT THIS MOST CRITICAL TIME FOR THE HEALTH INDUSTRY AND PROFESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE COMPLEXITIES. OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MANY MANY MULTIPLE AND CERTIFIED HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ALL WHO HAVE EXTENSIVE TRAINING AND TESTING. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR PURPOSE SERVING OUR HEALTH NEEDS. EDIT ADDITION WHO ALSO HAVE TWO INDOOR AND ENJOY IF YOU WILL. REGULAR TRAININGS. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE IN THEIR PROFESSIONS. THEY SHOULD ANOTHER IS THE PARTICULAR THESE PROFESSIONALS HAVE NO BUSINESS WITHIN THE PROVISIONS. OF AB TWENTY TWO AND FIFTY SEVEN. THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD REMOVE THEM FROM THE ONEROUS BURDEN. AND THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THAT THIS LEGISLATION HAS NOW EFFECTED ON ALL OF US. URGENT I WILL. ON THE MEN THANK YOU CENTER NELSON CENTER HERTZBERG.

SECRETARY PLEASE READ. AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR NIELSEN SET EIGHT GO HEAD CENTER NIELSEN THANK YOU THESE AMENDMENTS ALSO RELATE. TO THE VERY IMPORTANT HEALTH CARE PROFESSION THE SEARCH EACH OF US. NEARLY EVERY DAY THESE ARE THE PHARMACIST. THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE HOSTAGE IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT FLIP THROUGH HERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THE PHARMACIST HAVE EXTENSIVE EDUCATION. THEY LIKE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS MUST HAVE. ONGOING CONTINUING EDUCATION TO MAINTAIN THEIR SKILLS AND EXPAND AND IMPROVE THEM PARTICULARLY IN THESE DYNAMIC TIMES. THE PHARMACIES PROVIDE SO MUCH. IT ARE SO CRITICAL TO DELIVERING OUR HEALTH CARE NEEDS. I BELIEVE THAT THEY MOST ASSUREDLY MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETAIN THEIR INDEPENDENT STATUS IF YOU WILL. AND TAKE ANOTHER THING IN MIND FOR MANY OF THESE. PROFESSIONALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. THEY HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY THAT THEY DESERVE AND THEY'VE PRACTICED AND DEDICATED THEIR LIVES. TO THAT INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE VERY SPECIFIC SKILLS THAT SERVICE. SO NOW WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT OVERRIDES ALL OF THIS WE MAKE IT ALL HOMOGENEOUS AND THEY'RE JUST A TEENY BIT OF THE WHOLE. I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THEIR IMPORTANCE. AND IT'S NOT AS IN THE CASE OF THE OTHER CAL CARE PROFESSIONALSI JUST REFERRED TO. WE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CHAOS. IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY THE PROVIDERS OF THOSE OF THOSE PHARMACIST WHO SERVICE I HEARD JULY VOTE.

HE'S CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PROFESSION. THEY HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN THEIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS. WHAT REQUIREMENTS TO PRACTICE YOUR CHOSEN LICENSED PROFESSION. MEMBERS ARBITRARILY CHOOSING WHICH LICENSED PROFESSIONS TO ABIDE BY THE STRICT REQUIREMENTS OF ABC TASK IS COUNTER TO THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE NEED FOR LICENSURE IN THE FIRST PLACE OUR STATE LICENSURE IS ENOUGH TO PROVIDE WORKERS AND CONSUMERS WITH ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS OR IT'S NOT.

ON THE FLOOR SEEING NONE SINGLE ONE HAND RAISED SENATOR DOLLY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST WANT TO RISE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD ALL THESE AMENDMENTS THAT. YOU AB FIVE ACTUALLY HAS SOME REAL COMPLICATIONS AND WE'VE HEARD I'M SURE ALL OF YOU FROM YOUR PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICT THAT ARE VERY FRUSTRATED IN THESE CARVE OUTS NEED TO STOP WE NEED TO FIX AB FIVE IN GENERAL AND FOR THOSE REASONS- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THERE ARE SOME GOOD WORK IN THEIR- BUT THOSE WHO'VE BEEN NOT BE FAR BEHIND OUR- STILL. WHEN WE SEE SUFFERING AND YOU KNOW IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM IT'S ABOUT ALLOWING PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THOSE WHO WANT TO SECURE IS OF JOB AND A FORTY HOUR WEEK THAT'S GREAT THEY CAN THEY CAN GO TO WORK FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THOSE OF US WHO. WANT FREEDOM AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO- YOU KNOW INDEPENDENTLY CONTRACTED TO GROWN HOURS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY ARE SENATOR JOHN. THANK YOU MEMBERS. I SHARED SEVERAL TIMES IN COMMITTEE AND ON THE FLOOR THAT- YOU KNOW FOR MOST OF MY LIFE I'VE BEEN AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MY WIFE CURRENTLY IS- THIS IS THE- MANNER IN WHICH WE'VE CHOSEN TO. EARN MOST OF OUR- LIVING MOST OF OUR CAREER. AND A LOT OF CAL MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS HAVING THAT SAME CHOICE- THIS BILL DOES MOVE. THE NEEDLE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO ALSO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR JOHN CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MAJORITY PARTY DIDN'T ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THIS BILL TREMENDOUSLY BETTER- SO I'M ASSUMING THAT. NEXT YEAR MORE AMENDMENTS WILL BE ARE MORE- ANOTHER BILL WILL COME FORWARD THAT THAT YOU GUYS APPROVED SO I'M HOPING THAT A LOT OF THESE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT ARE REALLY STRUGGLING- TO KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO YOUR OFFICES AND THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OF SYMPATHY THERE FOR. THESE ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE- WE INTRODUCED. AT INDIAN BUT AS FAR AS THIS BILL GOES IT DOES HELP A LITTLE BIT TO CLEAN UP AB FIVE IT- IT DOESN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS TO CLEAN UP ALL OF AB VICE DISASTROUS MESS. BUT IT DOES- HELP A FEW OTHER PEOPLE. IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES SO I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES AGAIN TO SUPPORT THIS BILL- AGAIN I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MAJORITY PARTY DID NOT TAKE THE AMENDMENTS. THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF MORE PEOPLE INCLUDING MY BILL WHICH WOULD REPEAL AB FIVE ALTOGETHER AND ALLOWED PEOPLE THE WORKER FREEDOM CHOICE THAT WE NEED- I AM. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN PEOPLE WORKING AT HOME I'M TRYING TO ADAPT A DISTANCE LEARNING HAVING YOUR KIDS AT HOME YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND WORK FREELY OUTSIDE OF THE HOME- WHEN THEY'RE ABLE TO. WIN OR EVEN INSIDE THE HOME AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WOULD BE REALLY BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY IN A TIME IN A PANDEMIC THAT WE FACE RIGHT NOW- WHEN MOST JOBS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS UNLESS RESIDENTIAL WORKER. AND SO- LIKE I SAID I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DID NOT TAKE THE AMENDMENTS BUT- THIS BILLDOES MOVE THE NEEDLE A LITTLE BIT. AND I GUESS- A LITTLE BIT IS BETTER THAN NOTHING AT ALL SO I ASK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE CENTER MELINDA'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT- I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT IT. THE FACT. THAT WE HAVE HAD SO MANY BILLS INTRODUCED TO AMEND. THE ORIGINAL BELT SHOULD TELL EVERYONE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG. WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE ALL HAD PEOPLE. WRITE TO US. CALL LIGHTS IN TEARS BECAUSE NOW THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB AND THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY AND- YOU KNOW THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE. ORIGINALLY WHERE THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THOSE WEREN'T REAL JOBS ANYWAY. WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THEY WERE REAL JOBS AND THEY WERE REAL PEOPLE. WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. BY THIS LEGISLATION AND NOW THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO IT. AT A TIME. I MEAN IT COULDN'T COME AT A WORSE TIME FOR A LOOK WHERE WE ARE IN OR PEOPLE ARE LUCKY. TO EVEN STILL HAVE A PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT TO GO THIS IS HAVING A TERRIBLE EFFECT ON PEOPLE MEAN JUST. SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN SAID YOU KNOW THEY THEY ABSOLUTELY MUST WORK IN THIS FASHION BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMEONE AT HOME. WHO IS WHO IS SICK THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE WHERE THEY HAVE A SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD SO THEY REALLY NEED. THAT FLEXIBILITY I BAD PEOPLE RIGHT TO ME AND TELL ME THAT. THEY WERE NOT HIRED BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THEY WILL TAKE SOMEONE FROM OUT OF STATE RATHER THAN TAKE SOMEONE FROM CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT RUN AFOUL OF THE LAW. THIS IS. ONE OF THE MOST DISASTROUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION WE COULD HAVE EVER PUT FORWARD. AND THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD HAVE EVER SIGNED IT IS RUINED. THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS AND I AM JUST SO DISHEARTENED AND DISAPPOINTED THAT WE COULDN'T COME TOGETHER ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND GIVE PEOPLE SOME RELIEF. AND GIVE THEM BACK THEIR DIGNITY. AND THEIR WAY OF LIFE FOR THEM AND THEIR WAY OF SUPPORTING FAMILIES THIS IS SHAMEFUL. FOR ALL OF THE TARGET WE HERE IN THE SENATE FOR ABOUT LIFTING PEOPLE UPOUT OF POVERTY AND ALL THE OTHER BILLS WE PASSED BECAUSE WE SAY IT'S GOING TO. HELP LOWER INCOME MANY HELP BLACK COMMUNITIES AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. THIS IS HURTING THEM. SO WHERE THE RELAY FOR THEM. ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOES THAT NOT MATTER. I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A BLIND EYECAN BE TURNED TO THE PLATES THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW SITE WALLABY SUPPORTING THE BILL I AM GREATLY DISAPPOINTED- THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WERE NOT TAKEN TO HELP EVERYONE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MELINDA'S CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I AM PREPARED TO VOTE FOR THE REAL LIFE. BETTER YOU SHOULD READ ON THE FLOOR HI MY- WITHOUT OBJECTION THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHICH TOOK OUT ANY TEAM SIXTY EIGHT LET ME PROVIDE THIS QUOTE FROM DIRECTLY FROM IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY TROUBLING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IT SAYS NOR SHALL ANY STATE DENY TO ANY PERSON WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOES EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE IT CREATES THOSE WHO ARE NOW GOING TO BE. A PROJECTION OF THIS LAW AND LEAVES OUT A SCORE YOU SCORE OF PEOPLE THOUSANDS ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT OF THOSE WHO ARE IN THE FRANCHISE BUSINESS FROM THE PROTECTION OF THIS LAW SO IT'S REALLY- IT HAS PICKED WINNERS AND LOSERS WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL ALONG YOU KNOW I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING PART OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT MAKES THAT KIND OF DECISION THAT HARMS. HELP SOME HARMS SCORES AND SCORES OF PEOPLE FROM THE LIVELIHOOD THAT THEY CHOSE PERHAPS AS YOUNG CHILDREN DREAMING OF WHAT THEY WANTED TO BE SO WE NEED TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE THIS REPEAL IF NOT BY WHEN I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE A VERY THOUGHTFUL REVIEW OF THIS AS WE GO INTO THE NEXT SESSION OR HOPEFULLY THAT THE COURT STEP IN AND DO THE RIGHT THING. I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL HOWEVER THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER. BATES CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU. PRESIDENT I. ALSO BE WILLING FOR THE BILL BUT AB FIVE PUT IN SOME EXTREMELY ONEROUS PENALTIES AND SO CPA'S. ENROLLED AGENTS. ATTORNEYS ARE HAVING A REAL DIFFICULT TIME TRYING TO INTERPRET AB FIVE- IT IS COSTING A LOT OF BUSINESSES A LOT IN FEES I ENDED IT- IT JUST IS JUST OVERSTAFFED WE WILL DYNAMICS WAS WRONG. NO ARGUMENTS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DYNAMICS SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE APPROACH THAT THEY DID BUT TO HARM- AND HURT SO MANY INNOCENT BUSINESSPEOPLE HI IS THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD REALLY STEP BACK ON AND REFLECT. WHEN I HAVE A BUSINESS OWNER WHO SAYS WE CAN'T GET A DECENT OPINION. AND WE'RE A PUBLISHER AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO. READ A WRITER AND AUTHOR AS AN EMPLOYEE OUT BECAUSE THEY USUALLY GET ROYALTIES BASED ON THE SALES OF THEIR BOOKS SO INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR LONG LEGAL OPINIONS. WE'RE JUST GONNA MOVE OUR BUSINESS TO ARIZONA AND SO I HAD TO SAY GOODBYE TO SOME PEOPLE SO I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE COULD TAKE A HARDER LOOK. AT AB FIVE. AB TWO TWO FIVE SEVEN IS THE NATURAL COURSE WERE EVERY YEAR WE- THROW SOME MORE PEOPLE. INTO THE WHAT HE CALLED ON THE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT SO WE NEED TO FIX IT IT'S GOT TO BE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR EVERYBODY- AND- WITH THAT I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR GIVING US THE TIME.

THE QUESTION WAS IS THAT APPROPRIATE IN DENYING REVIEW THE COURT SAID THAT THIS WASN'T THE RIGHT TASTE TAKE UP THAT ISSUE BUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE SPECIFICALLY REFERRED TO ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY SEVENTY AS SOMETHING THAT WAS MOVING IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS PART OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND ENDING RACISM IN OUR JURY SELECTION SYSTEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU MEMBERS I I APPRECIATE WHITE HOUSE CONSENSUS BECAUSE COMMENTS SO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO'S COMMENTS ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO TO REALIZE HERE IS THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE BUT THIRTY SEVENTY IS NOT THE RESOLUTION OF THAT ISSUE THERE ARE OTHER METHODS AGAIN I AGREE WITH JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL SAID WE SHOULD ELIMINATE PRINT TREES WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS THIS BILL BASICALLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT ESPECIALLY WHEN RACE IS AN ISSUE AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT RACE WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFENDANT EXCLUSIVELY BUT ALSO WITH RESPECT TO THE VICTIM WHAT THIS DOES IS ESSENTIALLY WHERE THE DEFENSE COUNSEL HAS TEN PRINTER JONES ON A FAMILY OR TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE -- WHERE THERE'S LIFE IMPRISONMENT AND THE PROSECUTORS BASICALLY ELIMINATED FROM THE EQUATION WHAT THAT WILL DO IS WILL SKEW THE JURY AND YOU MARK MY WORDS THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE NOT JUST AN IMPEDIMENT BUT IT'S GOING TO CREATE A MAJOR PROBLEM I URGE A NO VOTE AND I URGE THAT WE ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE NEXT YEAR MY COLLEAGUES INSTANCES GOING I HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL AND AND WHAT WE MIGHT DO TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE I URGE THAT WE DO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WE RESOLVE IT NEXT YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU OF BEFORE WE GO TO CENTER ROSS WE HAVE -- SENATOR BORCHERS HAS HIS HAND UP SENATOR BORCHERS THANK YOU WE JUST GOT DONE HAVING A LENGTHY DISCUSSION ON EIGHTY FIVE AND THE REASON WHY I BRING THAT UP IS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH HOUSES FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY SUPPORTED AB FIVE BUT PRIVATELY HAD HAVE SPOKEN -- WHETHER OR NOT THE ISSUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VETTED MORE PRIOR TO A DECISION BEING MADE I USE THIS BY ANALOGY HERE THAT YESTERDAY'S ROBUST DISCUSSION UPON PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES YOU'RE HEARING FROM SO MANY FOLKS IN YOU WILL EVEN MORE DOWN THE ROAD THAT IF WE'RE LEARNING A LESSON ON HOW THIS IMPACTS PEOPLE WHETHER IT BE DEFENDANTS WHETHER BE PUBLIC DEFENDERS WHETHER BE PROSECUTED BE JUDGES THIS CLEARLY DID NOT GO THROUGH A VETTING PROCESS AND I WOULD IMPLORE MY COLLEAGUES LET THIS GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS BE BROUGHT BACK IN JANUARY BECAUSE IF WE'RE TO LEARN A LESSON FROM HOW WE BE FIVE PLAYED ITSELF OUT IT WILL AFFECT YOUR COMMUNITIES AND IN WAYS WITH A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO EVEN THOUGH I THINK THIS THING HAS A LOT OF MERIT IN A FEW DIFFERENT AREAS HE DESERVES TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE SCREENINGS ARE COMMITTEES WITH EXPERTS AT HAND AND -- THE NORMAL VETTING PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FOR GOOD POLICY THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR BORDER SENATOR ROTH FIGURING PRESIDENT TERM COLLEAGUES AS YOU KNOW I'VE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME IN MY VARIOUS CAREERS IN OUT OF COURT ROOMS AND I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT MINE -- BIASES AGAINST THE USE OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IN FACT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD -- THE DOCTOR MEASURE THAT ELIMINATES PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND -- THE PROCESS FOR THE USE OF PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES IS RIFE WITH PROBLEMS INCLUDING PROBLEMS OF DISCRIMINATION AND THE LIKE SO WHEN I REVIEWED THIS MEASURE I WAS PREDISPOSED TO VOTE TO A ADOPTED MMHM BUT I WAS APPROACHED BY FOLKS FROM ALL SIDES AS PART OF THIS PROCESS AND AFTER BEING POUNDED FOR A FEW DAYS I DECIDED I REALLY NEEDED TO DIG INTO THIS MEASURE AND SEE WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY SAID BEYOND JUST READING IT AND HOW IT WOULD APPLY TO THE PRACTICE OF TRYING TO WORK IN A CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM AND SO I'M SPEAKING BY WAY OF EXPLANATION OF MY NO VOTE BEFORE AND MY NO VOTE AS THIS ROLE IS CALLED ONCE AGAIN AND WHAT I FOUND WHEN I LEARNT LOOKED INTO THE BILL IN THE PROCESS THAT IT WAS IT WAS COMPELLING FOR USE IN OUR TRIAL COURTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I FOUND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT WAS GOING TO LENGTHEN THE PROCESS BY WHICH ARE CRIMINAL COURT TRIALS ARE BROUGHT TO CONCLUSION AND WHEN IT APPLIES TO THE CIVIL TRIALS IN OUR STATE IT WOULD LENGTHEN THOSE AS WELL AND COMING FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY WERE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS TAKING MORE THAN FIVE YEARS TO GET A CIVIL CASE TO TRIAL SUCH THAT THEY HAD TO CALL THE CASES CALL THEM AND THEN A JOURNALISM TO AVOID HAVING THE CASES DISMISSED BECAUSE WE HAVE A RULE IN THE STATE BUT IF THE CASE IS NOT BROUGHT TO TRIAL WITHIN FIVE YEARS IF IT'S A CIVIL CASE IT WILL BE DISMISSED AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OUR CRIMINAL CASES WERE TAKING UP ALL OF THE AVAILABLE COURT ROOMS ALMOST IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY SO I LOOKED AT THIS PROCESS AND I NOTICED THAT ARE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION A GROUP OF TRIAL JUDGES THAT HAVE TO MANAGE THE PROCESS IN OUR COURT SYSTEM HAD A SERIES OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THE BILL WAS DRAFTED END OF THE CALIFORNIA TRIAL JUDGES ASSOCIATION LISTED THESE CONCERNS IN ONE OR MORE DOCUMENTS AND TOOK A LOOK AT THEM AND I REJECTED THOSE THAT I THOUGHT HAD LESS MIRRORED AND I CAME UP WITH A LIST OF ABOUT TEN CONCERNS THAT I THOUGHT WERE SUBSTANTIAL AND FRANKLY I REDUCE START SPENT THE NIGHT DOING THIS ON A REDUCED THESE CONCERNS TO A TWO PAGE DOCUMENT AND I SENT THE DOCUMENT AROUND AND I ASKED THE AUTHORS STAFF THROUGH MY STAFF WHAT WERE THE WHAT WERE THE REASONS WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE THAT THESE CONCERNS WERE NOT ADDRESSED WHY DID YOU NOT TAKE A LOOK AT THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING TEST THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS ASKED TO APPLY CLEARING CONVINCING EVIDENCE WHEN THERE WAS A SENSUALLY NO EVIDENCE IT WAS GOING TO BE PRESENTED IN THE TRIAL IN WHICH TO UTILIZE THAT TO US WHY DID YOU HAVE AN APPELLATE COURT PROCEDURE WHERE IN CONTRAST TO THE NORMAL APPEALS PROCESS WE WERE GOING TO ASK THE APPELLATE COURT TO EXERCISE A DO NOVO REVIEW WHICH MEANS JUMPED INTO THE PANTS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE AND AND SECOND GUESS THE TRIAL JUDGE WHO'S ON THE SCENE AT THE TIME LOOKING AT THE DEMEANOR OF THE WITNESSES THE ACTIONS OF THE TRIAL COUNSEL IN THE LIGHT AND ON AND ON I WON'T BORE YOU WITH THE LIST OF TEN OR SO -- ISSUES THAT I WAS TRYING TO PUT FORTH AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION AND THEN THE OTHER DAY THERE WAS AN ANSWER THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE ON IN BY SOMEONE ON THE FLOOR DEBATE THAT THE THE OBJECTIONS OF THE CONCERNS OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION SHEPHERD SO SHE ASIAN WERE DRESSED AND THERE ISN'T THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH WITH RESPECT TO THAT THOSE CONCERNS REMAIN THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION JUST LIKE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DOES NOT FEEL THE ABILITY TO TAKE A VERY STRONG POSITION IN THIS LEGISLATURE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BECAUSE THE BILL IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE PRINCIPLE COOPER ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WE CONTROL THE PURSE STRINGS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'VE NOT BEEN VERY GENEROUS AS YOU KNOW OVER THE PAST IN THE PAST YEARS SO I'M GOING TO BE VOTING NO THE PROCESS IS ON YOUR GLOBAL THERE WAS A FAILURE DRESS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE JUDGES WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO MANAGE THE PROCESS AND FRANKLY I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME HERE ON THE DETAIL SO THE WILL PUT TERMS OF THE THE DOORS OF THE LEGISLATURE IS ACTUALLY A WORKABLE PRODUCT NOT A WANT NOT OF A PRODUCT TO SIMPLY ADDRESS ISSUES ISSUES THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT NEED TO ADDRESS THE ADDRESS IT'S A COMPELLING SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO THESE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES THERE ARE USED TO ENGAGE IN DISCRIMINATION WHICH IS INTOLERABLE BUT WE KEPT IN FIXING THAT CREATE A SITUATION WHERE WE CANNOT GET CASES TO TRIAL WE CANNOT GET CASES THROUGH TRIAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL SO ROTH WILL BE VOTING NO ON THE MEASURE AGAIN TODAY THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING NONE SEEING NO HANDS UP SENATOR WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH TRYING TO PRESIDENT -- IT'S ALWAYS AWKWARD TO DISAGREE WITH YOUR FRIENDS IN THE SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND THE SENATOR OFTEN RIVERSIDE OF TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR WHOM I HAVE THE AMONG THE HIGHEST RESPECT IN THIS LEGISLATURE ON BUT WE HAVE A FRIENDLY A DISAGREEMENT AMONG AMONG FRIENDS THAN AMONG COLLEAGUES -- I NO BILL IS PERFECT WITH THE AUTHOR DID TAKE SOME AMENDMENTS FROM THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION I DON'T I DON'T THINK SHE'S CLAIMED TO HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THEM -- BY THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE JUDGES ASSOCIATION TO TAKE WHAT THEY CALL IT I THINK WAS A GOOD FAITH EFFORT ON ALL SIDES ON THIS BILL IS HONESTLY IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALSO AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT BY THIS LEGISLATURE THAT WE DATA AND THAT WE WANT TO SEE CHANGE -- AND SO I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A GOOD STOP AND I ASKED HER AYE VOTE ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF TWENTY FIVE FORTY TWO BEFORE YOU TODAY HARMLESS ERROR HARMLESS ERROR IS NOT HELD BY ITS STATEMENTS IN A COURT OF LAW OR DESCRIBE HARMLESS ERROR IS HOW PRESIDENT PREJUDICIAL BEHAVIORS DESCRIBED HARMLESS ERROR IT'S OUR RACISM IS DEEMED ACCEPTABLE IN OUR COURTS OF LAW. THIS BEHAVIOR IS CONSIDERED HARMLESS ERROR IN OUR CURRENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM. MANY OF YOU WILL KNOW MORE THAN FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN THE KLASKY VERSUS CAMP THE U. S. SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THERE MUST BE A DEMONSTRATION OF COLD CONSCIOUS DELIBERATE BIAS. AND THE GENERAL DISPARITIES AREN'T ARE N INEVITABLE PART OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT DECISION IS WIDELY KNOWN AS THE DRED SCOTT DECISION OF OUR TIME. THE NEW YORK TIMES WROTE THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAD QUOTE EFFECTIVELY CONDONED THE EXPRESSION OF RACISM. THE L. A. TIMES CALLED THE RULING THE WORSE THE CREAM COURT RULING SINCE TE SECOND WORLD WAR. AS A RESULT. PREJUDICE BIAS AND RACISM ARE HARMLESS ERRORS IN OUR COURTS AND WHERE THE PEOPLE SEEK EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. SPECIFICALLY WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY TWO PROHIBITS THE STATE FROM SEEKING. ARE UPHOLDING THE CONVICTION OR A SENTENCE. THAT IS DISCRIMINATORY BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. THE BILL PLAYS A DISTINCT ROLE IN HOW AND WHEN A PERSON IS CHARGED WITH THE CRIME. AND HOW THEY PURSUE THEIR DUE PROCESS IN THE COURT. IT'S TIME TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE POLICY THAT MAKES IT UNLAWFUL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLORFUL. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE STATE'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- THERE ARE. OPPONENTS INCLUDING BE. JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IF PEOPLE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE ON MY CLOTHING.

ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AN ACT RELATING TO PESTICIDES SENATOR ALAN. THIS BILL AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT LIMITING USE OF ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDES WILL WHILE THE CURRENT PESTICIDE REGULATION CONDUCTS A REEVALUATION OF THESE PRODUCTS. A SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDES ARE USED AS A MEANS TO MANAGE RODENT POPULATIONS BUT THESE POISONS UNFORTUNATELY CAN LAST SEVERAL DAYS IN THE BODIES OF ANIMALS AND SOMETIMES- MONTHS IN THE BODIES OF A ROAD IN. WHICH IN TURN THEM INTO EASY PREY FOR APEX PREDATORS SUCH AS MOUNTAIN LIONS AND OTHERS WHO THEN SUFFER AS WELL JUST LAST WEEK WE HEARD ABOUT THE DEATH OF P. SEVENTY SIX THE SIX COLLARED MOUNTAIN LINE TO DIE FROM ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDES IN THE THIRD O DIE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. RESEARCHERS AT UCLA AND THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE HAVE DOCUMENTED THE PRESENCE OF THIS FOR DENNIS CITING TWENTY SIX OF TWENTY SEVEN LOCAL MOUNTAIN LIONS HAVE BEEN TESTED IN OUR AREA SO. LET ME JUST MENTION THAT. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL IT'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR. OUR WILDLIFE I WILL SAY THAT OUR OUR AUTHOR HAS WORKED VERY HARD. HE TOOK SOME LATE AMEND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE AT FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE LAST DAY TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE HE TOOK HIS LATE AMENDS THAT. WERE ALL THE FOLKS FROM AG ALL THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY- DROPPED THEIR OPPOSITION- SO I WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING. NO MICROPHONES ON THE FLOOR SENATOR. I'M SORRY SENATOR GLAZERS AND THEN WE WILL GO TO SENATOR DOLLY. SENATOR GLAZERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. I CERTAINLY NONE OF US WOULD ARE HAPPY ABOUT. OUR WILDLIFE SIDE. EATING SOME ANIMAL THAT HAS- POISON IN THEIR BODY THAT AFFECTS THEM I MEAN WHO WANTS THAT RIGHT. BUT WE HAVE A PROCESS IN THE STATE THAT DEALS WITH PESTICIDES AND OTHER CHEMICALS IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE CHOICES WE MAKE. ARE NOT POLITICAL CHOICES THERE BASED ON SCIENCE. HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU. HURT OR YOU YOURSELF HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THE NATIONAL DEBATE THAT SCIENCE MATTERS. SCIENCE MATTERS AND SO HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WE GET THESE ONCE EVERY YEAR TO COME BEFORE THE SENATE. WHERE SOMEONE SAYS THIS IS BAD AND WE NEED TO CIRCUMVENT THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED IN LAW FOR HAVING A THOROUGH REVIEW BASED ON SCIENCE. AND SO MY OBJECTION TO THE BILL TODAY IS NOT BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. RAT POISON BECAUSE I CERTAINLY AM. BUT IT'S ABOUT HONORING A PROCESS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED A LAW SO THAT THE JUDGMENT WE MAKE IS BASED ON SCIENCE NOT BASED ON POLITICS AND THAT'S THE SHORTCOMING OF THE BILL BEFORE YOU. AND WHILE BE VOTING NOW. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WILL SPEAK ON THIS BILL ADDS OBVIOUSLY AS SOMEBODY WHO IS AGRICULTURAL HAZARD PESTICIDE OUTTURN APPLICATORS PERMIT HERE MY WALLET AND ALSO SMEBODY WHO CARES ABOUT WILDLIFE DEARLY AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND I WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE ON A LOT OF. ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO WILDLIFE AND BUT IF YOU CAN GET THE FARM BUREAU AND THOSE FOLKS TO GO NEUTRAL I GOTTA GIVE IT TO ME MOST OF TOOK A HECK OF A LOT OF MINUTES. BUT THE POINT IS MORE SO IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO USE THESE ANTI COAGULANTS IN THERE THE REASON I'M IN THE WRONG WAY. AND SO I FEEL I AGREE WITH MY FRIEND FROM THE BAY AREA THAT. YOU CAN HAVE YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE LAWS YOU WANT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE USING- PRESCRIBING THEM IN THE RIGHT WAY. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ALL KINDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ILLEGAL POT GROWS USING ROW DIDN'T RODENTICIDES. TO KILL PREDATORS THAT ARE EATING THEIR PLANTS IT'S GETTING A WATER STREET JUST GETTING OUR FISH. IS KILLING THE MOUNTAIN LION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE LOSING. THE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF HABITAT FOR THESE ANIMALS AS WELL SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD SIZE WE NEED TO GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKING THE LAW AND WHO ARE BUYING THESE THINGS ILLEGAL. AND USING THEM IN THE WRONG FASHION I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT 99% OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REGULATED IN THIS BUSINESS ARE DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY I INCLUDING MYSELF I'M ONE OF THOSE THAT. YOU THINK YOU HAVE P. P. EASE INTO YOU SEE ME USE CHEMICALS I OF THE SPRAY NOZZLES I HAVE A FULL SUIT ON AND GLOVES IT'S SERIOUS BUSINESS AND WE WANT TO PUT IT ON THE RIGHT WAY WE WANTED TO NOT BE OVERPRESCRIBED. SO I WOULD JUST SHARE THAT I THINK THAT WE TAKE LEGISLATION WE MAKE LAWS BASED OFF OF THE MOTIONS THAT NOBODY WANTS AMOUNT LINE TO DIE BECAUSE OF AN ANTICOAGULANT THAT IT EIGHT FROM SOMEBODY WHO POISONED SOMETHING. SO MY GOAL HERE IS TO DO GOOD SCIENCE BUT ALSO GO AFTER BAD ACTORS BECAUSE YOU CAN REGULATE THE REGULATED BUSINESS TO DEATH IT WON'T CHANGE THE OUTCOME LET'S CHANGE THE OUTCOME BY GOING AFTER THE BAD ACTORS. THAT ARE REALLY CAUSING THE PROBLEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO OTHER MICROPHONES UP. I'M SORRY SAID THE CENTER STORE IN. DEVELOPERS ARE BE BRIEF I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE HERE- UCLA NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SHOWED THAT IN A RECENT STUDY SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT RODENTICIDES WERE REMOVED FROM THE SENATE THE SHELVES. THAT THE USE IS ACTUALLY GOING UP SO WE HAVE ALREADY MADE EFFORTS TO TAKE THOSE THOSE PRODUCTS OFF THE SHELVES AND YET THE PEST CONTROL APPLICATORS KEEP USING IT WHY BECAUSE IT'S CHEAP AND IT'S EASY AND IT'S EASIER IN SOME WAYS THAN JUST CLEANING UP YOUR GARBAGE WE'RE DOING THE MAINTENANCE YOU NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE RATS. PEOPLE WANT DRUGS THINGS LIKE TYSON OR OR OTHER EXCUSES WHY THIS MAY BE A PROBLEM WE'LL TELL YOU WE CAN COME UP WITH A LOT OF EXCUSES OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHILE WE EXISTING THEM OUTLINES A CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE A FACT. IT'S ONLY A FEW LEFT. THERE IS A PROCESS RIGHT NOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS RESTRICTED BY DPR FROM IMPOSING THEIR OWN REGULATIONS THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TODAY TO BREAK THAT IMPASSE THE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR OWN VOTE. THANK YOU ALL DEBATE HAVING SEE SENATOR ALAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MEMBERS I DO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM THOUSAND OAKS ROOF FOR THAT ADDITION- YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T WITH WITH GREAT RESPECT TO MY FRIEND FROM AMENDED THE ISSUE HERE IS- THAT THERE IS A PROCESS HAPPENING IN. THE IDEA IS THAT THAT- THAT THIS WOULD LIMIT THE USE OF THESE RODENTICIDES UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF HAS SAID REGULATION YOU KNOW CONDUCT THIS RE EVALUATION- IT'S TRUE THEY'RE DOING THIS BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S REALLY NO END DATE THERE'S NO TIME LINE IN SIGHT- WE KNOW THE PROBLEM SEVERE WITH THE SCIENTISTS AND CLEAR- THAT THEY'RE HAVING YOU KNOW THESE READINESS EITHER HAVING A NEGATIVE.

ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD AN ACT RELATING TO HEALING ARTS SENATOR GLAZERS. IF THANK YOU OF MADAM PRESIDENT NUMBERS EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT NINETY AUTHORIZES NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PROVIDE CARE TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THEIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND IN SOME CASES WITHOUT PHYSICIAN SUPERVISION. THIS BILL SPECIFIES EXACTLY WHAT SERVICES A NURSE PRACTITIONER CAN PROVIDE. SERVICES WITH WHICH THESE PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN PROVIDING. CALIFORNIANS FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME. A FEW NURSE PRACTITIONERS SERVE DIAGNOSING PATIENTS. INITIATING THERAPIES TO KEEP PATIENTS HEALTHY AND MAKING INDEPENDENT DECISIONS ABOUT TREATING HEALTH CONDITIONS. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU SUPPORTS MULTIPLE STUDIES EVALUATING THE ROLE OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS AS A PART OF THE CARE TEAM TO HELP FILL GAPS IN PRIMARY CARE. AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT WORK OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION AND NUMEROUS OTHER REPORTS. THIS BILL MAXIMIZES THE NURSE PRACTITIONER SKILLS WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. AND IT PROVIDES NURSE PRACTITIONERS FULL PRACTICE AUTHORITY AFTER A TRANSITION PERIOD OF COLLABORATION. MEMBERS AT THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS SPENT. MANY MANY HOURS DIGGING INTO THIS ISSUE IN A VERY DEEP WAY AND PROBABLY MORE SO THAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MY FIVE YEARS HERE. WE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS LISTEN TO ALL SIDES CERTAINLY THE LISTENING CAREFULLY TO THOSE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. TO UNDERSTAND AS DEEPLY AS ONE COULD THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD ABOUT THE BILL. AND WHETHER THERE ARE WAYS TO IMPROVE IT. AND MAKE IT BETTER. YEAH I RECOGNIZE THAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY STILL HAS CONCERNS. AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES TO THIS BILL HAVE GONE AS FAR AS THEY NEED TO. HOWEVER THIS BILL HAS MULTIPLE. GUARDRAILS IN PLACE. TO MEET OUR SHARED GOALS. OUR PATIENTS SAFETY AND ACCESS TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL ITSELF TO SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY AMENDMENTS. THAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THIS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. MORE THAN A DOZEN AMENDMENTS. WERE TAKEN HERE IN THE SENATE LET ME REVIEW JUST A COUPLE OF THOSE. THE STUDENT THAT ARE PRESIDENT. HAVING TROUBLE HEARING. I'D LIKE TO REVIEW A COUPLE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS. THE BILL ENSURES QUALITY AND IN TRAINING OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS. ARE REQUIRING ACCREDITATION FOR CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS. THE AMENDMENTS WE TOOK ENSURE THE CONFIDENCE OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS IF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING AND THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATION SERVICES FINDS IT THERE ANY GAPS IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING. THOSE GAPS TO BE FILLED BY REQUIRING A SUPPLEMENTAL EXAM EFORE THE NURSE PRACTITIONER CAN PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY. ANOTHER AMENDMENT REQUIRES NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO NOTIFY PATIENTS THAT THEY ARE SPECIALIZED NURSES NOT POSITIONS. AND PROVIDE INFORMATION WHERE THEY CAN FILE COMPLAINTS. AND FAMILY MEMBERS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL PROVIDED CLEAR GUIDELINES ABOUT WHEN AND WHERE REFERRALS TO PHYSICIANS ARE REQUIRED. TO ENSURE NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE ONLY PRACTICING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE. WHICH CORRESPONDS DIRECTLY TO THAT EDUCATION TRAINING. AND FINALLY THE BILL WAS AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT ANY DISCIPLINARY ISSUES. GO TO THE NEWLY CREATED ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH WILL HAVE A TESTIFIED NUMBER OF POSITIONS ON IT. MEMBERS THIS BILL IS A GOOD BILL AND IT'S DESERVING OF YOUR SUPPORT TODAY I RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITH DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS. I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF OUR- MY GOOD FRIEND FROM AROUND- BUT UNFORTUNATELY I STILL HAVE TO STAND IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL- I GUESS OUT FIRST JUST SAY IS THAT- WELL HE DIDN'T REFERENCE IT IN HIS REMARKS- SENSIBLY THE REASON FOR DOING THIS BILL WAS SUPPOSED TO- THIS ACTUALLY. ADDRESS ACCESS ISSUES IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT- NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE QUITE BUSY RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS OUR POSITIONS AND- THERE'S VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT WOULD DRESS THOSE ACCESS ISSUES. I DO APPRECIATE- THE- GUARDRAILS THAT- THAT- AGAIN MY GOOD FRIEND RENDON PLACED ON THE BILL IN THE VARIOUS AMENDMENTS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DROP PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF A COMPARISON BETWEEN EVEN WITH THESE GUARDRAILS. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A INDEPENDENT PRACTICING PHYSICIAN THE END OF HIM PRACTICING NURSE PRACTITIONER AND THE KIND OF GUARDRAILS ACTUALLY WE PLACE ON POSITIONS THEMSELVES. SO I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. ABOUT LOW OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT IN ORDER FOR A PHYSICIAN IN FAMILY PRACTICE THEY JUST HAD TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND THEN THE PUBLIC SAID WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. SO ACTUALLY IN FACT- WE IS PHYSICIANS. HAVE TO COMPLETE FOUR YEARS OF POST GRADUATE EDUCATION WHICH IS MUCH LONGER THAN. THE UNFORTUNATELY THEN UNDER STRUCTURE CURRENTLY EVEN HAS TO GO THROUGH. HOWEVER THAT IN ITSELF IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW A PHYSICIAN TO HAVE INDEPENDENT PRACTICE. AND SAID IT BY LAW HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU D. TO COMPLETE A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. THREE YEARS. YOU CANNOT IN THE FAMILY PRACTICE IS THE PHYSICIAN UNTIL YOU'VE COMPLETED THREE YEARS OF RESIDENCY. SO AGAIN YOU'D HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO A LOT MORE CLINICAL TIME BEFORE YOU CAN GET TO BE SURE TO THAT POSITION. EVEN AFTER YOU FINISH THAT THREE YEARS OF CLINICAL ALFA OF MOUNTING MEDICAL FOR YEARS MEDICAL SCHOOL THREE YEARS OF RESIDENCY. AFTER YOU COMPLETE THAT. USE THAN AND OR TO BE ABLE TO PRACTICE- HAVE TO GET BOARD CERTIFIED. IN THAT BOARD CERTIFICATION IN FACT IS NOT FOREVER. IN FACT THAT POINT OUT THAT IN ORDER FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICES PHYSICIAN. EVERY TEN YEARS I HAVE TO RECERTIFY AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE NURSE PRACTITIONER HAS TO READ BE REEVALUATED. IN THE SAME WAY. AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FACT I ASKED ABOUT IT TO COMMITTEE AND THE AND THE AUTHOR DID NOT GIVE A STRAIGHT ANSWER. SO THERE ARE MANY MORE REQUIREMENTS BEING PLACED ON A POSITION. NOR TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENTLY THEN THERE ARE ON THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS EVEN WITH THE GUARDRAILS. FINALLY I DO WANT TO SHARE PERHAPS A THIS THIS THIS TRUE STORY. THE TRUE STORY THAT- AS THAT- WHEN I WAS IN THE CLINIC AND UNFORTUNATELY- WE HAD WHAT WE HAD PATIENTS AND WE HAD A YOU KNOW A NURSE PRACTITIONER THERE WONDERFUL NURSE PRACTITIONER- GOOD GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. EXPERIENCED OVER A DECADE OF CLINICAL PRACTICE- AS A NURSE PRACTITIONER. AND SHE SAW A PATIENT WHO CAME IN WHO I CAME IN FOR PNEUMONIA AND APPROPRIATELY TREATED DIAGNOSED AND TREATED THE PNEUMONIA. AND THEN THE PATIENT HAD TO COME BACK A COUPLE TIMES FOR FOLLOW UP WITH THE PNEUMONIA. AND SO SHE NOW ONLY SAW THE NIZHAL SHE SAW THE PERSON THE FOLLOW UP THEN FINALLY THIS SEPARATION IS ALSO SEEN FOLLOW UP BY A RESIDENT PHYSICIAN. PRESENT POSITION BY THE WAY IS NOW OUT INDEPENDENTLY PRACTICE HAS. TO BE SUPERVISED. AND THAT. RESERVES'S NOTICED. A NEUROLOGICAL SIGN IN THE PATIENT. THAT WELL WAS NOTED BY THE NURSE PRACTITIONER SHE NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY A SIGN. OF A TUMOR. IN THAT PATIENT. OF COURSE I IS THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN. WHO HAD TO GO AND- SUPERVISE THAT RESIDENT OF COURSE CONFIRMS THAT THAT WAS THE CASE. NOW PROBABLY EVENTUALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUND OUT BECAUSE THAT NURSE PRACTITIONER AT THE TIME BECAUSE OUR CURRENT LAWS ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE SUPERVISED. SO THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN IN THE END IN REVIEWING THAT CASE I WOULD HAVE NOTED IT. AND THEN FILE THE WAY TO GET IT BUT I THINK THAT IS THE CHALLENGE RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW IT'S A FAIRLY RARE BRAIN TUMOR SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE HE DID A SMALL STUDY PICK IT UP THAT SOMEONE MISSED THAT DIAGNOSIS. AND I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE WHO DEMANDED THAT PHYSICIANS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THE MANY WAYS THAT YOU KNOW BEFORE WE CAN INDEPENDENTLY PRACTICES POSITIONS. AND SO I DO THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY- BECAUSE OF PATIENTS I DO- AND CONCERNS THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL STILL DESPITE ALL YOUR EIGHT IF YOU SEE THE HARD WORK- IS NOT. DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH AND WE JUST EVEN COMPARED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO. IN TERMS OF INDEPENDENT PRACTICE AND WHAT THAT BASICALLY HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK THANK YOU SENATOR MOVING TO OUR COLLEAGUES REMOTELY WE'VE GOT THOSE SENATOR GROW GORGEOUS MORLOCKAND DOLLY WE'LL START WITH SENATOR GROWTH. ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO SENATOR BORCHERS. SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT WITH THE AUTHOR I CHATTED WITH THE POSITION AND- WITH THE NURSE PRACTITIONER. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE RARE. BILLS WHERE YOU TRULY DO SEE BOTH SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT AND I AM ABSOLUTE RESPECT FOR DR PAN AND DOCTOR WOULD IT AND I CAN ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE. SO HERE'S- MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT IN THE VALLEY WE HAVE A MASSIVE SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS RIGHT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS IS A PROBLEM SO WE'RE HAVING EXPANDED AUTHORITY FOR NURSE% PRACTITIONERS COULD BE A GOOD THING IT WOULD NCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR UNDERPERFORMING COMMUNITIES ARE. MINORITY POPULATED COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT IN AND OF ITSELF. HE IS APPEALING ON THE FLIP SIDE ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT IF YOU EXPERIENCE. THE ROLE OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS YOU WILL FURTHER ALIENATE. THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE AREA TO PHYSICIANS TO DOCTORS. OTHERS IN THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA SO YOU'RE ATTRACTING MORE FOLKS TO HELP. OUR COMMUNITY BUT ULTIMATELY YOU'RE TAKING AWAY SOME OF THE TALENT THAT IS NEEDED AS AS WELL. AND SO I'M LIKE WELL WHAT EXACTLY DOES A POSITION TO WIN THEIR THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ENTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING- NURSE PRACTITIONERS. I KIND OF HAVE THIS IDEA IN MY HEAD THAT IT'S SOMEBODY IN THE CORNER OR DOWN THE HOLE IN THE CLINIC OR THE HOSPITAL ORWHATEVER THE SITUATION MAY BE WHERE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY CONSULTING WITH ONE ANOTHER REGULARLY AND MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS RECOMMENDATIONS AND IN ACTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THAT RARELY ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN FACT- ONE CONVERSATION AGAIN. THE DOCTOR WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY. AND STILL SATISFIED THE NEED IN THAT SITUATION OF TECHNICALLY OVERSEEING THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN THIS FACILITY. SO I APPRECIATE SCOPE OF WORK AND IT IS IMPORTANT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE'S ENOUGH FOLKS IN THE WORK FORCE THAT CAN SATISFY THE NEEDS OF OUR OF OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS REALLY A FIFTY FIFTY IN MY OPINION. HEARING WHAT DOCTOR PAN HAD SAID THAT. ALLOWING FOLKS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE RIGORS IN CERTIFICATIONS AND LICENSURE OF BEING- PHYSICIANS. HAS BENEFITS AND. I THINK WHAT I'M I'D LIKE TO WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY BUT I THINK THE ULTIMATE NEED IS ALREADY SATISFIED IF PHYSICIANS DON'T HAVE TO BE PRESENT. AND THEY CAN STILL SATISFY WHATEVER IS NECESSARY. IS THIS BILL TRULY NECESSARY. SO I'M M. I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY BUT THIS IS IT'S A FASCINATING SUBJECT AND- I'D LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SAID IF COLLEAGUES I RISE IN. OF AB EIGHT NINETY I'M READING SURVEYS OF MEDICAL DOCTORS WHO ARE PLANNING TO RETIRED SOONER THAN ANTICIPATED. THIS CALL MAY NINETEEN LOCKDOWN HAS HAD NUMEROUS NEGATIVE REVERBERATIONS. I'VE ALSO OBSERVED HOW NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO BE A HUGE ASSIST TO GENERAL PRACTITIONERS SO MUCH CAN BE ADDRESSED FOR NUMEROUS COMMON AILMENTS. CONSEQUENTLY THIS PROVIDES A SOLUTION TO A DECLINING WORKFORCE WHILE ASSISTING RESIDENTS WITH MEDICAL ADVICE BUT BASIC NEEDS AS RELIEF TO A GROWING NEED. I APPRECIATED IN ANY OF THE EMAILS  RECEIVE I KNOW WHATEVER INDIA'S AND I KNOW WHAT INDIAN PS THANK YOU BUT THIS IS NOT AN INTRUSION ON A HOLLOW PROFESSION IT IS A RELIEF IT IT IS LIKE THE CALVARY COMING UP OVER. THE HILL TO PROVIDE REINFORCEMENTS TO A TIRED ARMY OF WONDERFUL. AND OVERWORKED DOCTORS. I'M NOT SURE HOWEVER IF COME FROM WITH THE BORDER NURSING SYMBOL MEANT AS I'M UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT THEIR TRACK RECORD BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER TIME BUT I'M SURE PATIENTS WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MD AN MP I HEARD TONIGHT. THANK YOU MEDICAL SENATOR GROW. SENATOR GROVE SORRY. SORRY THANK YOU M. THIS BILL IS A PRETTY DIFFICULT BILL BECAUSE SAM. I DO THINK THAT- ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAL PROCESS MIGHT HELP US- GET ACCESS TO RURAL HEALTH CARE. LIKE WHERE WE HAVE IN THE VALLEY WE NEED ACCESS TO REAL HEALTH CARE. I ALSO AM CONCERNED ABOUT QUALIFICATION PIECES AND MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE QUALIFIED TO DO THE WORK. I DID HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THEN SOME QUESTIONS AND MAYBE THE AUTHOR COULD ANSWER MENTOR. IN THE CLOSE. AND YOU KNOW I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A- CHANCE ON A BILL LIKE THIS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT'S GOING TO WORK. AND THAT WE DON'T SET UP OUR RULE UNDERSERVED DISTRICTS- FOR LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. THERE IS A PROPOSITION I BELIEVE IT'S PROP FIFTY SIX. BIT GIVE US MANY TO INCENTIVIZE- DOCTORS LIKE REAL DOCTORS MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO COME TO THE REALLY REASON SERVE ENTER SEARCH COMMUNITIES. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS LIKE I SAID. I KNOW THAT WITH THE IMPACTS OF CODED A WE DO HAVE A LOT OF DOCTORS THAT ARE YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND HELP. COULD BE BENEFICIAL. BUT I ALSO AND LIKE I SAID VERY CONCENED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF CARE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT- THE EDUCATION EXPERIENCE IN THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCES BEHIND THE INDIVIDUALS THAT- PROVIDING THAT CARE. IN THE ROLE COMMUNITY WOULD THINK THAT THIS BILL MIGHT PROVIDE A LOT OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO. COME TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR IN RURAL AREAS SUFFER MY COLLEAGUE FROM DEEPER REPRESENTS. BUT IS THAT THE SAME AS HAVING A DOG. THAT'S GONE THROUGH TRAIN. AND GONE THROUGH A RESIDENCY AND GONE THROUGH YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL CLASSES THAT ADDITIONAL- LIKE EXPERIENCE TRAINING I GUESS YOU'D SAY LIKE EXPERIENCE ON THE JOB- THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION RISK PRACTITIONERS HAVE A POLICY. THAT REJECTS ANY PROVISION WHICH MAY INCENTIVIZE NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE AND RURAL. UNDERSERVED AREAS- SO I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE TO THINK THEY'RE THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS ARE GOING TO WANT TO COME TO THIS. TO THE RURAL AREAS THAT I REPRESENT. AND I WAS WONDERING WHY THAT WASN'T ALLOWED TO BE IN THAT BILL. AND THEN I'M LOOKING AT THE MAPS WITHOUT SUPERVISION FROM THE FOR NURSE PRACTITIONERS. AS THEY REALLY DON'T GO TO UNDERSERVED AREAS- WHEN YOU REMOVE THE SUPERVISION SO WHY THERE TEN CENTER NURSE PRACTITIONER. TO AT LEAST IN RURAL AREAS LIKE WE DO FOR PHYSICIANS- THREE PROP FIFTY SIX SO I KNOW THAT- PHYSICIANS ARE DO THEIR TRAINING- IN RURAL AREAS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES- SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHY. AND WE DIDN'T HOW LOUD THAT IN THIS BILL AND THEN IF IT'S SUPPOSED TO CREATE INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE ESPECIALLY FOR A MEDICAL POPULATION- WHY ISN'T THERE AN INK WHY ISN'T THERE ANY INCREASED AND UTILIZATION COSTS FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM- ON ANY OF THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO READ. SO WITH. AGAIN I THINK THAT OUR MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND OUR DOCTORS AS IT WOULD GIVE THEM AN AVENUE OF ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CARE. AND THEN PROVIDE A QUALITY OF CARE SERVICES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS I HAVE A GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE- I'M GONNA BE SELFISH I HAD A GREAT CONCERN ABOUT JUST THE RURAL AREAS YOU KNOW DOCTORS GOING TO LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE PLACES NEWPORT BEACH BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ASK HIM TO COME TO BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA ARE THEY GOING TO COME. IN SO I HAD THE SAME CONCERN WITH OR TO HATCH FEAR RAGE CRESTOR AND MANY OF THOSE PLACES SO I THE SAME CONCERN WITH THIS BILL ON THE NURSE PRACTITIONERS I WOULD HAVE LIKE SOME TYPE OF INSURANCE IS. THAT THEY WERE GOING TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE IN IN OUR AREAS IN THE UNDERSERVED AREAS THAT I REPRESENT. SO I'M A LITTLE IN DECIDED- AND DECIDED ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL MEDICAL HEAD AND LISTEN TO THE COMMENTS AND THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. A PER SHARE- AM I CALLING FROM SACRAMENTO'S COMMENTS HIM BEING A PHYSICIAN A DOCTOR THAT'S BEEN TRUE- THE RIGORS OF BECOMING A DOCTOR. I BUT I ALSO. THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL- RECIPROCITY ARTHUR THE BILL WHO IS- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT- ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC THERE'S THAT THERE'S A GREATER ACCESS TO CARE. AND SO. IT'S KIND OF A HARD BILL TO DECIDE ON OR TELL THEM TO WORK ON IT. AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR WHAT MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE TO SAY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. MY THOUGHTS AND IF THE FATHER COULD ADDRESS SOME OF MY QUESTIONS. IN THE CLOSE ABOUT WHY THAT WAS IT IN THE BILL IN THE FIRST PLACE I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER. SENATOR WILL. YOU'RE A MUTE. WHERE THAT. IT IS FIRST US IN DOWN BY AND FORTH A COMES SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO IN THE CORNER ANYWAY AM THINKING ABOUT A PRESIDENT SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT NINETY I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I'VE SERVED ON THE BT COMMITTEE FOR ALL BUT IT JUST A HANDFUL OF MONTHS. AND M FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ISSUES IS ALWAYS PATIENT SAFETY FOLLOWED BY PATIENT ACCESS YEAH WHEN I FIRST GOT UP HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE- HOLD ME SIXTEEN OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HAD THE PROPER DOCTOR. YOU PATIENT REYES. SO I AM VOTED TO FUND MEDICAL SCHOOLS I HAVE VOTED TO FIND WAITING STUDENT LOANS FOR DOCTORS AND GUESS WHAT WE ARE STILL AT ONLY SIXTEEN HAVING THE PROPER DOCTOR TO PATIENT RATIO ADD TO THAT FACT- WE IMPLEMENTED CHAD COVERED CALIFORNIA TWENTY THIRTEEN. IT WAS A JOHN BILL DURING AS SET. WHERE WE EXPANDED THE L. ELIGIBILITY FOR NET CAL. IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THE REPUBLICAN ANNOUNCES THAT SAID WE'RE GONNA END UP. ONE POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE THE DEMOCRATIC ANALYSIS SAID A ONE MILLION IT IS THE FIVE POINT ONE MILLION SO ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE NOW JUST ON THAT ACCOUNT. WE HAVE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. THIS BILL IS DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT. AT ALL THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I SUPPORTED IT IS BECAUSE IMPLEMENTED IT WILL DONATE IMPLEMENTATION DATE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO WE HAVE ANOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE IF WE IF WE WANT TO- BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS- NURSE PRACTITIONERS WORK VERY INDEPENDENTLY ALREADY I TALKED TO A NUMBER OF DOCTORS FROM MY DISTRICT AND THEY ALL DIDN'T IT THAT WOULD BE BEEN THERE LONG ENOUGH. AND THERE'S A TRUST LEVEL THE DATE THEY PRETTY MUCH HAVE FREE REIN THERE SIX YEARS OF TRAINING IN THIS BILL. THERE'S TWENTY TWO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THAT ALLOW LISTENERS PRACTITIONERS AND FRANKLY WE'RE GOING TO BE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE. IN IN IN OUR APPROACH OTHERS AMENDMENT- THAT I ASKED FOR. IN THIS BILL WILL COME UP A COUPLE DAY AGO THEY HAD NOT BE SO. I KNOW THAT'S A GREAT WAY MY FROM ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T LIKE THE NURSING BOARD DOING IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK. THEY NEED TO BE FIXED BUT THE OTHER ONE IS- OUR- GOOD FRIEND FROM NAPA HAS BUILT HAVING TO DO WITH MIDWIVES. HE HAS AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN THEIR- BATTLE IN THAT COMMITTEE GUARANTEES FORTY PERCENT. OF THE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ARE DOCTORS- MYSELF AND THE SENATOR FOR THE- CHINO HILLS I DON'T KNOW. AYE DIAMOND BAR- WE ASK FOR THAT AND THEN AND AN AUTHOR GRACIOUSLY EXTENDED THAT. SO WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE AT THIS POINT IN HIS IS JUST BEEN IN VAIN. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING WITH THIS BILL TO BE ABLE TO. A PATIENT SAFETY WITH ACCESS AND TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS TEACHERS PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL AREAS LIKE LIKE I HAVE SO I STRONGLY SUPPORTERS STILL. ENCOURAGE EVERYONE ELSE TO FOLLOW P. REGULATE NOTHER BITE AT THE APPLE. FOR THOSE THINGS THEY DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S COMPLETE BUT IT'S COMPLETE ENOUGH TO GET US DOWN THE ROAD. TO TAKING CARE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU CENTER WELCOME SENATOR. DOLLY THANK YOU MADAM MEMBERS I NOT RETURN TO EVERY THAT THE GOOD SENATOR JUST SPOKE ABOUT I AGREE WITH ALL THOSE THINGS I WANT TO SHARE SOMEBODY FROM A RULE DISTRICT. WHO HAS WORKED WITH THE DOCTOR WOULD QUITE FRANKLY FOR SINCE MY TIME. IN COMING YEAR. ON WAYS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET. ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL AREAS WE DONE. FRONTIER LEGISLATION FOR HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO HIRE DOCTORS- WE WORK AND I WAS ON BEING P. WHEN THIS BILL. CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY I VOTED FOR THIS BILL ALREADY I THINK IT'S ONLY GOTTEN BETTER. SINCE THE THERE HAS BEEN AMENDMENTS TO IT. AS YOU GUYS RECALL LAST YEAR- I HAD MY COUSIN DR DALLI. WHO WOULD NOT RULE DR AMERICA HE'S HE SEVENTY ONE YEARS OLD HE STILL PRACTICING IN OUR LITTLE COMMUNITY UP THERE. IN A RULE HEALTH CLINIC AND YES THE PRIVILEGES AT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILES AWAY. WE CANNOT ATTRACT PEOPLE LIKE DR DOLLY ANYMORE THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO GET OUT TO OUR RULE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST. QUITE FRANKLY YOU NEED TO BE A GENERAL PRACTITIONER NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THERE'S MOST PEOPLE GOING TO SPECIALTIES AND THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF. ANOTHER WORK FOR THEM- TO PICK UP THERE'S- LOANS AND ALSO YOU KNOW THE MICRO AND ALL THE THINGS WE DEAL WITH SO. THIS BILL I THINK IS IN THE ROAD IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IT IS DEFINITELY NOT PERFECT. BUT IT'S A HECK OF A LOT BETTER THAN WHERE WE WERE AND I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE THINGS THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL- SENATOR WILL RAPPORT I WON'T. TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN I STRONGLY URGE A VOTE THIS WILL HELP. RULE PEOPLE GET ACCESS THANK YOU SENATOR DOES NOT PERFECT WILL COME BACK AND FIX THOSE THINGS ARE PERFECT BUT FOR NOW I THINK THIS IS A STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU SIR AND I VOTE ON THIS WILL HELP THANK YOU CENTER WITH CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR JONES. AT YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND- THE- WE ARE IMPORTANT FOR REGISTERED NURSES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP A COUPLE TIMES BY CONCERNS FROM SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS- IF IT WOULD BE OKAY- MADAM PRESIDENT. AND THAT TOO RELATED QUESTIONS IF I COULD POSE THOSE. TO THE AUTHOR PLEASE. TWO QUESTIONS WITHOUT OBJECTION SENATOR GLAZERS WILL TAKE THE QUESTIONS PERHAPS ANSWER THEM IN AS CLOSE. OKAY YEAH THAT'S FINE HOWEVER I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT DIALOGUE SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM TO BRING HIM UP SOONER THAN THAT BUT WHAT BUT I'M FINE WITH THAT TOO- SORT. TO RELATED TO RELATED QUESTIONS WHY AREN'T THERE MORE GUIDELINES IN THE BILL TO STRUCTURE HOW EACH TRANSITION TO PRACTICE SHOULD FUNCTION AND THT'S AND THAT'S THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND THEN THE SECOND ONE REGARD THE B. R. IN AS IT STANDS. THE LANGUAGE LEAVES IT TO THE B. R. IN WHY ISN'T THE MEDICAL BOARD INCLUDED SINCE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CURRENTLY GOVERN- THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE SO NUMBER ONE GUIDELINES FOR THE TRANSITION OF PRACTICE. NUMBER TWO- WHY NOT INVOLVE THE MEDICAL BOARD WITH THE OVERSIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR JONES. SENATOR GLAZERS I SEE NO OTHER MICROPHONE SETUP IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND IN YOUR CLOTHES. VERY GOOD YOU MAY CLOSE SENATOR GLAZERS. ALL RIGHT MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU TO ALL THE TO STATE IN THIS DEBATE TODAY. LET ME JUST A COUPLE THINGS QUICKLY IN CONCLUSION HERE NUMBER ONE A NURSE PRACTITIONERS IS IT IS A PERSON IS ALREADY REGISTERED NURSE. AND THEY HAVE EARNED POSTGRADUATE A NURSING DEGREE A MASTER'S OR DOCTORATE. AND THEN THEY'VE BEEN CERTIFIED BY NASA. CERTIFYING BODY SO THAT'S HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER STANDARDS THAT YOU MUST MEET. TO BE A NURSE PRACTITIONER. BOB LIBYA SAY THAT. IN THE BILL IT REQUIRES A MINIMUM OF THREE TO SIX YEARS TO ELEVATE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING A NURSE PRACTITIONER INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OF THREE TO SIX YEARS. AND AS A SENATOR EARLIER MENTIONED THIS BILL DOES NOT GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH HELPS ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR JONES JUST A MOMENT AGO. THAT THE GUIDELINES FOR TRANSITION A PRACTICE IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE OF THE BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING THE TAKE THIS PERIOD OF TIME. TO EXAMINE THE TESTING THAT'S DONE TO MAKE SURE THEY MEET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DETAILS ON TRANSITION TO PRACTICE. ARE ESTABLISHED AND IN REGARD TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THE REPORTING SHOULD BE WE'VE CREATED A SPECIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THAT'S MADE UP OF OF REGISTERED NURSING SO WE PROVIDED THAT INPUT THAT NOT WOULD NOT NORMALLY BE THERE IT'S THE SAME US- STRUCTURE WE CREATED FOR THE MIDWIFE'S BILL THAT WE APPROVED. EARLIER THIS YEAR. ADD TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT. RURAL AREAS. I AND WITH THERE'D BE A LEVEL OF CARE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUE AND I ON BOTH ACCOUNTS. NUMBER ONE I AM TOLD THERE ARE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE- NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO PRACTICE IN RURAL AREAS IS NOT CHANGED BY THIS BILL CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON. GOING FORWARD. AND NUMBER TWO THIS ISSUE OF LOWER LEVEL OF CARE. GOES CONTRARY TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF THIS BILL WHICH IS THAT WE'RE ONLY ALLOWING. ANYBODY IN THE MEDICAL FIELD TO PRACTICE TO THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT THEY HAVE. THERE'S NOTHING. NOBODY WANTS OF STANDARD HERE THEY HAVE TO MEET THE HIGHER STANDARD WITH THE PRACTICING IN AN URBAN AREA. OR IN A RURAL AREA. AND FINALLY MEMBERS. THERE'S PRACTITIONERS CAN RACTICE INDEPENDENTLY IN FOURTEEN STATES IN AMERICA TODAY. I WHEN WE LOOK AT AN ISSUE LIKE THIS WITH THE BUSINESS PROFESSION. COMMITTEE LOOKS AT IT IF YOU LIKE THIS IT IS ALL ABOUT PATIENT CARE. IT IS ALL ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. BUT SHE'S A DOCTOR WOULD IS WORKING VERY HARD ON IT FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND IT'S DESERVING OF YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. COLLEAGUES COULD IF WE COULD ALL GET TO OUR SEATS PLEASE.

SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FIVE SENATOR ARCHULETA AN ACT RELATING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIFORMS CENTER ARCHULETA. THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT I PRESENT SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY WILL MINIMIZE PUBLIC CONFUSION BY MANY POLICE ARE FOR BANNING POLICE OFFICER FROM USING COMMA FLOOD BY PROVIDING GUIDELINES FOR PROPER LABELING AND IDENTIFICATION AS AN ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REMAIN COMPLIANT WITH THIS BILL. FOR THAT I ASK FOR NOVEL. THANK YOU CENTER ARE TO LETTERMAN REMIND ALL OF OUR MEMBERS OF THESE ARE BILLS THAT ARE BACK ON CONCURRENT WE HAVE ALREADY DEBATED THE BILL SO LESS IS MORE IN THIS CASE. ANY CENTER GROVE. THIRD ROW CENTER GROVE YOU'RE ON MUTE. M. CENTER ROAD HOLD ON WE CAN FEARLESS MOVING BUT WE CAN'T HEAR YOU SO HOLD ON ONE SECOND YOU'RE A MUTE. CAN SHE HEAR ME. OKAY. CENTER GROVE YOU HAVE TO AMUSE YOURSELF. THERE'S A BOX THAT SAYS THE HOST WOULD LIKE TO AND YOU YOU AND I CLICK YES AND SO I WOULD JUST ASSUME THE HOSTESS AT UT SORRY I WAS JUST LETTING YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAD WERE ON MUTE I DON'T WANT YOU TO WASTE YOUR WORDS WHEN WE CAN'T HEAR YOU THAT'S ALL PLEASE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THAT MADAM PRESIDENT. AS THE FIRST FEMALE VETERAN THAT'S EVER SERVED ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY FLOOR OR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE FLOOR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SWEAR TO DEFEND. THIS COUNTRY AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC- YOU. HAVE A PRIVILEGE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY WHO'S WILLING TO PUT YOUR HAND IN THE AIR AND SWEAR TO DEFEND THIS COUNTRY AGAINST ALL ENEMIES. FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC INCLUDING UP INTO GIVING THEIR LIFE. FOR THIS- GREAT AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY THAT WE- LIVE IN. I THINK THAT THAT IS- OF AT MOST RESPECT. AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT JUST BECAUSE I'M A FEMALE VETERAN I SAY THAT BECAUSE OF MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ANGLER. AS SENATOR ROSS IN ALSO- SENATOR MELENDEZ AND IF I FORGOT SOMEBODY I DOAPOLOGIZE. SO IT SENATOR ARCHULETA I DO AND I REALIZE THAT YOU'RE A VETERAN TO SIR. I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL I KNOW THAT IT PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY OR EMPLOYEES IN PEACE OFFICERS. AND SHALL NOT AUTHORIZED TO ALLOW THEIR EMPLOYEES TO WEAR. A UNIFORM AB SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO ANY UNIFORMITY UNITED STATES IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CAMOUFLAGE. IT'S ABOUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PEACE OFFICERS WHO WE DEEPLY RESPECT. THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN- THAT REPRESENTS DESTIN BLUE LINE THAT PROTECT US AND PROTECT OUR CITIZENS EVERY DAY. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE- WHERE- UNIFORMS- AT ART MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND MATTER. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW SHERIFFS AND POLICE TO PROMINENTLY SLATE ACROSS THEIR BACK OR CHEST AREA- IT BANS THE USE OF CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IT EXEMPTS MEMBERS OF SPECIAL WEAPONS AND TACTICS UNITS LIKE SWAT- OR SNIPER TEAMS AND TACTICAL TEAM ENGAGE IN TACTICAL RESPONSE FOR OPERATION OF DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IT JUST MAKES THEM COME UP WITH THE DIFFERENT UNIFORMS AND THE- UNITED STATES MILITARY WHETHER IT'S AIR FORCE COAST GUARD. UNITED STATES ARMY UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S THAT ARE UNITED STATES NAVY I DIDN'T WANT TO FORGET MY COLLEAGUE MISS MELINDA'S. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT- WHAT BRANCH OF SERVICE THAT YOU SEE SO. ME A FREE SIR IN OUR COUNTRY WE WANT TO SURE THAT. IS WEARING A- THAT DIDN'T. GROW TO SERVE. AND SO THE ON. INCITING OFFICE CAN I GET YOU ATTENTION ADVICE CHAIR OF I'M AT SENATE ROOM YOU NOT HEAR.

AND I'M TIRED OF THESE BILLS GOING OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY AND BEING DIMINISHED AND NOT AND PUTTING IT ON POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS. AND I JUST I JUST THINK THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR OURSELVES. AND I THINK WE SHOULD REJECT THIS CENTER ARE TO LET IT SHOULD BRING IT BACK NEXT SESSION AND HOLD FIRM ON THAT. AND SO FOR THAT REASON I KERR ENCOURAGED MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO.

IS THIS IS ONLY FOR CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM WHEN THEY'RE DOING MARIJUANA. THESE HAVE THE CAMPS PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE OF WHERE THEY IT'S IT WAS IN COORDINATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA. IS THERE GONNA BE A CONFLICT WITH THIS BILL- WITH THOSE WITH THOSE TYPE OF- MANEUVERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING TOGETHER. LET ME ANSWER THAT BY TELLING THESE ARE TACTICAL TRAINING EVENTS THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING OF IN THE CALM FLIGHT UNIFORM IS AUTHORIZED OFFICE IT IS THIS BILL IS THE STOP THE CONFUSION FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IN OUR ARMED FORCES AND POLICE OFFICERS BUT SWAT TACTICAL OFFICERS TRAINING THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ALL PERMISSIBLE. I READ THAT BUT BUT SOMETIMES. THEY'RE NOT FROM THE OUR STATE IN THERE THIS I GUESS IF THEY'RE COMING PROSTATE YOU GOING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH- THE UNIFORMS THEY NEED SO WE CAN ALL KEEP TRACK OF WHO'S WHO.

THANK YOU AND I'M GONNA ASK ALL FURTHER QUESTIONS AND THEN ASK FOR AUTHORS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS IN THEIR CLOTHES OKAY THAT WE CAN BE A LITTLE MORE EFFICIENT WITH OUR TIME NEXT EPISODE UNDER WAR JUST SENATE REPORTERS. THANK YOU JUST A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS DECIDED EARLIER. HOW WILL THE TWO SPEAKERS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST BE SELECTED. THE GENERAL PURITY WENT OVER THAT. WE DID NOT IS IF YOU'RE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT IN THE NEXT PERCENT SINCE PEAKING IN SUPPORT THE TWO WERE DONE AND THEN IF THERE'S TWO PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION IT'LL BE APART AND COMING UPON THE PRESIDING OFFICER TO KEEP TRACK. THAT'S WHAT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT IN THE ROOM. AND WE HAVE TO DO THE RAISING OF THE HANDS ON THE- ON THE WATER AND I'M GOING BACK AND FORTH. WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW IF I'M IN SUPPORT OR AGAINST. USUALLY AS A PRESIDING OFFICER YOU TAKE PEOPLE IN THE ORDER THEY RAISE THEIR MICROPHONES OR THEY RAISE THEIR HANDS THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN. SPECIFICALLY MY NEXT QUESTION MADAM PRESIDENT. IS I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT WE'RE NOT- WE'RE NOT VIEWED. SECOND ON THE LIST NOT AT ALL. INDIVIDUALS IN THE ON THE FLOOR.

AND THEN I MAKE A LITTLE LIST AND CALL ON PEOPLE IN THE ORDER. THAT THEY PUT THEIR MIKE OR THEIR HAND UP. SO IF I'M- IF I'M- ARE YOU CAN ASK ME WHETHER NINE FOUR AGAINST AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION MY HOPE WOULD BE SENT US OVER ME MY HOPE WOULD BE THE SINCE EVERYONE KNOWS THE RULES IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT AND YOU'RE THE THIRD PERSON AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN IN SUPPORT I WOULD ASK PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR TO PUT THE MICROPHONE DOWN AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO PUT YOUR HAND DOWN. OKAY YOU'RE GONNA BE SIGNED ME OUT TO. SETARA THEN THAT'S FAIR DEAL DESIGNATES BEFORE WE GET GOING.

THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOLDISTRICTS WHAT THE STATE HAS AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THE BUDGET HEARING THAT MAYBE THE MOST THE MAJORITY OF THEM.

THANK YOU CENTER GORGEOUS ONE MOMENT AT SYMMETRY PREPARED YES HE IS- YEAH PLEASE PROCEED CENTER BURGESS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT S. B. EIGHT TWO ZERO RESTRICTS CONTRACT SERVICES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THIS WAS THIS THE SAME BILL THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ THAT WE DON'T WOULD LAST CYCLE. IN THAT DID NOT WORK EARLIER IN THE YEAR RATHER AND DID NOT PASS IT IS NOT THE EXACT SAME LANGUAGE IT DEALS WITH SOME ASPECTS OF WHAT WAS INCLUDING HURT HER BILL BUT IT IS NOT THE EXACT SAME BILL NOW SIR. ALL RIGHT. ON MY OWN TIME I CAN'T GO DOWN I THINK I THINK THIS IS FAIR SO THIS IS A PROBLEM HERE. I DO APOLOGIZE CENTER GORGEOUS I DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A MICROPHONE OPEN IF YOU DON'T. HELLO MISTER DALLI WAS ADDED THAT CENTER BOARD JUST PLEASE PROCEED. YOU KNOW I- THERE IS A REASON WHY THIS BILL DID NOT PASS UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSED IT AND THE- MEMBERS OF THE SENATE OPPOSED TO. AND I THINK IT GOT CONVERTED INTO A BUDGET BILL BUT THE LIFE WE CAN UNDERSTAND. WHY A POLICY LIKE THIS WOULD FIND ITS WAY TO A BUDGET- A BUDGET BILL- I DON'T THINK THAT IS. A GOOD PRACTICE THE FIRST LINK- I WILL CERTAINLY BE VOTING AGAINST THIS AND- ENCOURAGE THOSE THAT HAD VOTED AGAINST THE UNIVERSITY OF CON CALIFORNIA BILL EARLY IN THE YEAR. THEY SHOULD TO OPPOSE THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR NIELSEN. GOOD EVENING TO PRESENT LED THEM IN THE SENATE ARE URGING NO VOTE. ONE OF THE ISSUES IS INDEED THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND WOVEN THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET OUR LITTLE TWEAKS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY PUBLIC EDUCATION IS SO. PARANOID. ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS EVERY YEAR BILL AFTER BILL THEY TRIED TO CONSTRAIN OR LIMIT OR WIPE OUT CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES. AND THESE ARE ONES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BEEN DEMANDING MORE CHARTER SCHOOLS. I WILL NOT COUNTENANCE TO SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT DOES ANYMORE. CLIPPING OF THE WEARING YOUR ELIMINATION EITHER COVERTLY OR OVERTLY OF OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE INTERESTING THING TO ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE ALWAYS JEALOUSLY PROTECTED THERE ARE SEPARATE CONSTITUTIONAL ECONOMY. IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THEY ARE NOW SEEKING THAT IF THEY ARE NOT OPPOSING THIS BILL. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THEY DON'T LIKE IT. BUT I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEM BUT I DON'T LIKE IT I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR LAYS IN GERMAN THE SENATE WE'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE ENATOR DOLLY THEN WE'RE GONNA RECOGNIZE SENATOR MELINDA CENTER DOLLY THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SORRY ABOUT THAT I DID NOT HAVE MY THING ON YOU FIRST TIME. DURING THIS WHOLE SESSION REAL QUICK I KNOW THAT WE'RE IN A HURRY SO I SHARE TO ABOUT CHARTERS THEY WERE DOING. HOME SCHOOL AND DISTANCE LEARNING WAY BEFORE COPING AND THEY'RE REALLY GOOD AT IT. AND SO MANY OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO WENT TO THAT IN IN TERM AND THEN THIS BILL DOESN'T HELP THEM OUT NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO AS YOU ALL KNOW. I PUSHED REALLY HARD TO TRY TO GET THE A DONALD BILL. TO THE FLOOR- LIABILITIES AND ISSUES NOT IN HERE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LIABILITY WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROLE PART OF THE STATE. AS SUCH AS THE PRESIDENT HAS. AND MYSELF. KIDS DON'T HAVE-INTERNET THEY DO THEY CAN'T DISTANCE. THEIR SENT HOME THE PACK. IN THEIR OWN THEIR OWN THIS BILL NOT FAIR. AND THE SCHOOLS CAN BRING THEIR KIDS IN IF THEY HAD THE LIABILITY WAY SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'LL BE OPPOSING THIS. LEGISLATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR HOLLINGS. WE'RE NOT GONNA RECOGNIZE CENTER MELINDA CINEMA IS A FULL RESOURCES. I THANK YOU MISTER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE. VOTED OUT A NUMBER OF BILLS THESE PAST FEW DAYS MANY OF WHICH WE HAVE DISCUSSED. THE ISSUE- AB AND GRACE AND- MAKING SURE THAT THINGS ARE- SHARING EVEN PLAYING FIELD. FOR CHILDREN OF COLOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHEN YOU PUT A BILL THROUGH LIKE THIS- IT HURTS COMMUNITIES O COLOR HURT STATE STUDENTS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THEY ARE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY GO TO. IS A FAMILY SCHOOL- IT'S NOT AN ADEQUATE SCHOOL FOR THE PARENTS WHO REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CHILD HAS A BETTER LIFE. AND HAS A CHANCE AT SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE AND THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO DO THAT MR EDUCATION AND A GOOD EDUCATION. SO MANY PARENTS WERE OCT TO CHOOSE A CHARTER SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO ADD TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING ATTAINABLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN THIS BILL TAKES THAT OPPORTUNITY AWAY FROM THE VERY COMMUNITIES. THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IT IN YOU KNOW NEARLY BILL AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYBODY WHO STANDS OUT TO. ADVOCATE TO MAKE ALLIES WHETHER A BEAR- CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM LINES EITHER YOU KNOW HOLD WRITING OF LIES- THAT WE HAVE TO DISCUSS WHETHER. IT MAKES IT MORE FAIR FOR THOSE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES. WHY WOULD YOU NOT THEN IT INSIST THAT THE EDUCATION THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS IS ALSO A BRONZE STANDARDS AND IS A GOOD QUALITY EDUCATION BECAUSE THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY IS GING TO REQUIRE THAT SOME STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE TO REMAIN IN A FAILING SCHOOL AND THERE IS NO DO OVER WITH. YOUR CHILD'S EDUCATION YOU GET ONE SHOT AT IT AND THEN THAT'S IT SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND THINK ABOUT THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE HAD OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS WHEN YOU'RE VOTING ON THIS BILL PLEASE DON'T VOTE TO TAKE AWAY A QUALITY EDUCATION FROM A STUDENT WHO VERY MUCH NEEDS IT. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THURMOND IS THANK YOU SO MUCH WE HAVE ANOTHER HIT UPPER GONNA GONNA CENTER MORALE GOOD EVENING CENTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I AND I WILL BE BRIEF- I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE BUT I JUST HAVE TO EXPRESS ON THIS IS THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PRODUCING RESULTS. FOR STUDENTS AND SELF FOR THE FACT THAT THAT- THE STATE'S DEPRIVING THEM OF THE FUNDS THEY NEED TO OPERATE- IF THEY'RE PENALIZING OUR PARENTS AS WELL AS THEIR CHILDREN BECAUSE REPLACE THEM IN THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH THEY ARE OUTPERFORMING- THEY YEAH THE OTHER MODEL OF OUR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS UNFORTUNATELY. AND SO ON ANYWAY I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING WAS RECOVERY NAME OUT AGAIN ANOTHER CAR THIS TIME IT HAS TO DO WITH OUR KIDS THE AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND SO WE SHOULD. BE PROMOTING A POLICY DETAILS- FAVORITISM. TOWARDS NINE AS I SAID THAT FOR THE FOR. THE NUMBER THING BUT ANY THIS. I URGE YOUR NOBLE ABOUT. IN THE REASON WHY IS WE WANT TO HELP- WE WANT HELP ALL CHILDREN IN ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE WE WANT HELP THESE CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OUTPERFORMING OTHER SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. HERE IN SEEN THAT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL DEBATE WE'RE GONNA TURN IT BACK TO BUDGETARY TO BE A CLOSE BY TO BUDGET YOUR- I'LL RESTATE WHAT I SAID A LITTLE EARLIER ON THIS BILL. ALLOWS FOR FUNDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MOST CHARTERS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE CATEGORY OF CHARTER. BILLS TO PROVIDE NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTERS BUT- CHARTERS ALSO WILL BE FUNDED FOR PLANNED GROWTH. IN AVERAGE DAILY TO THIS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. I ASKED FOR MY VOTE.

SENATE BILL TEN SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER AN ACT RELATING TO PRISONS CENTER SKINNER. THAT FOR CAN GOOD PROCESS BILL AS RELIABLE. THANK YOU SENIOR SKINNER OR LOOKING FOR DISCUSSION OR DEBATE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER MELINDA'S. I'M THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SO. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS- NUMBER ONE IT UNNECESSARILY MICROMANAGES THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS WITHIN OUR STATE PRISONS. THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS WHICH CURRENTLY STATES THAT NUMBER ONE NO DECISION SHALL BE BASED UPON INFORMATION FROM A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE UNLESS OTHER DOCUMENTATION CORROBORATES INFORMATION FROM THE SOURCE OR UNLESS THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE EVENT AND THE DOCUMENT AND RELIABILITY OF THE SOURCE SATISFIES THE DECISION MAKERS AT THE INFORMATION IS TRUE. AND NUMBER TWO THE ANY DOCUMENT CONTAINING INFORMATION FROM A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE SHALL INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE SOURCE'S RELIABILITY OF BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE REASON FOR THE CONCLUSION REACHED IN A STATEMENT OF REASON WHY THE INFORMATION OF SOURCES NOT TO. DISCLOSE THIS BILL INSTEAD REQUIRES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT. SECONDLY THE IT REQUIRES THE ACTUAL OR APPROXIMATE DATE THE INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED THIRDLY A STATEMENT FROM CDC ARE ON A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS HISTORY OF PROVIDING INFORMATION. ON FOR THE EVIDENCE USED TO CORROBORATE THE INFORMATION. IT IS- UNLIKELY THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IN CUSTODY WOULD BE WILLING TO PROVIDE. SUCH INFORMATION- ESPECIALLY THEY FEEL THEY MIGHT BE SUBJECT TO PHYSICAL RETRIBUTION SO I THINK WE CAN AGREE THAT. CDCR CAN CORROBORATE ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT THIS BILL GOES. REALLY Q. FAR IN IDENTIFYING THE INDIVIDUALS WHICH WOULD HAVE THE ADDED WHICH WILL HAVE I SHOULD SAY THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THERE'S. GREAT CONCERN FOR THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION RUNNING AS YOU STAND ON IT WOULD DEPRIVE CDC ARE FROM USING RELIABLE EVIDENCE HAVE BEEN MADE CRIMINAL. ACTIVITY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. YOUR HEARINGS FOR THEM TO WORK CRIMINAL PERSECUTION I MEAN PROHIBIT THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS FROM CONSIDERING SEVERAL OTHER ANALYSTS CONDUCT ORGANIZED LEASE RENTAL HOMES TOWARDS THE NO. CEREMONIES AND SO DINNER BUT WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU TO PLEASE DIRECT YOUR COMMENTS TO THE AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL. WELL YES I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT- THE AMENDMENTS ON THE BILL RELAY TO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS WHAT EXACTLY THIS BILL DOES AND- I JUST. HER SEVERAL POINTS I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO MAKE. IF I MAY CONTINUE. THANK YOU CEREMONIAL I'M SORRY ONE MORE TIME CENTER MELENDEZ. NO I SAID THERE YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT US TO SPEAK ON THE AMENDMENTS BUT- IF WE GO TO MEAN THE MAINTENANCE TIßN DIRECTLY TO WHAT THE BILL DOES WHICH IS WHAT I'M- TRYING TO TALK ABOUT IN MAKING MY CASE AS TO WHY THIS BILL. SHOULD NOT BE PASSED SO I WONDER IF I CAN. CONTINUE WITH THAT FRIEDMAN FIVE SINCE SINCE SINCE THIS BILL WAS IN FRONT OF THIS PARTY HERE PREVIOUSLY WE ARE LOOKING TOWARD CAME- CONVERSATION ON THE AMENDMENTS RELATED TO THE BILL- BUT YOU'VE MADE. YOUR POINTS WHICH WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THAT WE STILL HAVE A INDIVIDUAL WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SPEAKING OF THIS ALL RIGHT CENTER MELINDA'S WOULD LIKE TO GO TO GO TO LEADER GROVE. TO BE A SAFE YOUR COMMENTS. OUR OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ROLAND AS SET TAT'S GOING TO CENTER GROVE. AND THANK YOU AND. CAN YOU HEAR ME SIR YES MA'AM WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU TO GROW. THANK YOU AND MISTER PRESIDENT- YOU KNOW I HAVE A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH OVER THIS BILL BECAUSE- SPECIFICALLY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S- THAT HAVE OPPOSED THIS BILL THAT THE STATE DIDN'T DEPRIVE CDC ARE FOR USING RELIABLE EVIDENCE FOR INTIMIDATE. ACTIVITY AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND DISCIPLINARY HANDED HEARINGS- WHEN INMATE IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED SERIOUS RULE VIOLATION GIVEN NOTICE TO THE PROPOSED DISCIPLINARY HEARING. INCLUDING WRITTEN RIGHTS ADVISEMENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VIOLATION. THE NAMES OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS ARE NON CONFIDENTIAL. INFORMANTS ARE PROVIDED TO THE IN. AND SO THAT'S JUST THOUGHT TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP US- OR HELP SOMEBODY SOLVE A CRIME IT HAPPENS WITHIN A PRISON AND THEN THIS. THIS IS- THIS IS GOING TO EN MASSE THOSE INFORMANTS AND SO I GUESS HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE CRIME CRIMES IN PRISON. IF THIS BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD IF YOU'RE GONNA AND MASS THE PEOPLE THAT. ARE HERE TO HELP US SOLVE THOSE CRIMES IN PRISON- THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I GUESS I HAVE WITH IT IS YOU HAVE- IT SEVERELY IMPEDES CCAR'S ABILITY INVESTIGATE PAST PRISON CRIMES TO PREVENT FUTURE CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT. WE ARE AND I DID NOTICE THAT THE CDCR SECRETARY- THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD ON STAFF IN THE ADMINISTRATION RESIGNED. AND IT'S- IT SEEMS EVIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU WOULD THINK THAT A LOT OF THESE BILLS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH WOULD CAUSE HIM TO FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WE'RE TYING HIS HANDS. SO THAT HE COULDN'T DO THE JOB THAT HE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE PRISONS WERE OPERATED IN A SAFE. EFFECTIVE MANNER AND SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK FOR YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU ESPECIALLY WITH EXISTING LAW THAT AFFORDS INMATES FACING DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS A SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE IS- SUSTAINED WITH THE CHARGES. AND AGAINST THEM THE HEARING THE INMATES AT A HEARING IN YOUR MATES AND OFTEN CALL ALL WITNESSES. AND ENERGY SAW EVIDENCE. EXUDING THE- SERVER IN THAT SEEKS. ISSUE AND WE NEED TO SEE IF WE DON'T. I AM REALLY NOT TRYING TO BE RUDE BUT I'M JUST GONNA ASK YOU TO PLEASE SPEAK TO THE AMENDMENT SAYS. BUT WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE TO THE CONVERSATION SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE SPEAK TO THE MOMENTUM WE HAVE HEARD YOU'RE- VERY CLEAR POINTS WHICH WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE. RETROFITTING MIGHT SPEAK IN THE NAME IS PROTECTED IN THE FORWARD. EVERY DECISION ACTUALLY. ASKED FOR AN I. AND NOBODY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HAVE CENTER NIELSEN. I GOTTA CONFESS I'M REALLY MORE SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE FIVE OR SIX YOU MAY BE WATCHING THIS TONIGHT. I WOULD CAUTION MY COLLEAGUES TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL. IT'S DISTURBING TO ME TO SEE ALL THIS ACTIVITY ROAMING AROUND HERE RIGHT NOW AS WE'RE REACHING DEADLINES. LIKE SOMEBODY'S AFRAID. THAT WE MIGHT HAVE TO SHUT DOWN. I SUBMIT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT MAY BE THE VERY BEST THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN NOW THESE TO THE POINTS THAT WERE CHALLENGING FOR THE SENATOR MELENDEZ. UP AND THE SENATOR GROW. DAVID DWELT ON ISSUES DIRECTLY RELATED TO SOME OF THE ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS THEY WERE DRIFTING OFTEN BE INDELICATE OR THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANTIVE INFORMATION. AND SOME OF YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW SENSITIVE THIS WHOLE ISSUE IS OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS. MAYBE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN PRISONS. SO I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE THAT BE CAUTIOUS. AND DON'T WAKE UP NEXT YEAR SUNDAY AND BE CRITICIZED AND SAY WELL I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. WELL YOU DO KNOW ABOUT IT AND YOU'RE SITTING RIGHT HERE. EVERYBODY SHOULD ANALYZE AND TAKE A LOOK WE'VE GOT A SUPPLEMENTAL FILE NUMBER THREE THE JUST HIT MY DESK RIGHT NOW I BET WITHIN TEN MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT. I URGE CAUTION IN THOSE AREAS AND WE NEED TO TALK TO PLEASE THE IMMENSELY SYNGENTA NINETY GETTING. CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT. HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO WE'RE GONNA NEED FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE AMENDMENTS I HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY TOLERANT ENTIRE NIGHT. AND THEY DO BELIEVE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW THIS. SO CENTER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU SPEAK TO THE IMMINENCE. ON S. B. TEN SIXTY FOUR I AM OPPOSED- BECAUSE OF THE MAINTENANCE AND AGAIN THE BILL BECAUSE THE SUN COLLABORATED ALLEGATIONS AND SO- I WILL BE A NO VOTE I STRONGLY URGE THAT. THANK YOU CENTER MORAL CENTER GORGEOUS SENTIMENTS PLEASE THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SIR. CENTREBOARD JUSTIN IMMINENCE. WE NEED TO GET CENTER THANK YOU CENTER GORGEOUS. SORRY WHY I THINK I THINK PARK FOR THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THAT CORROBORATE OR EVEN UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION HAS SIGNIFICANT THE LADY IN THE PENAL SYSTEM. AND THE IDEA OF DISREGARDING AT WHOLESALE ULTIMATELY I THINK IT'S BECAUSE- IT'S GOING TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN SO IF ANYONE GOES TO TRIAL. THE WHOLE IDEA IS EXPOSING WHETHER OR NOT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WITH ALL THE BIAS SEES THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO A EIGHT EIGHT ACCORDINGLY SETTING THAT'S FOR A JURY TO DECIDE NOT NECESSARILY. HOLSEY TANGENT OREGON.

COMPARED TO WHAT THE HOUSE CURRENTLY HAS BASED OFF OF TIME STANDS STILL LEADER GROVE REQUESTED INFORMATION IN UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY PARAGRAPH EIGHT OF MASON'S LEGISLATIVE MANUAL IN ANSWER TO A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IS NOT A DECISION.

AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE APPEALED. MISTER BROWN. THAT CENTER BORDERS ONE OF THE QUIRKS LISTEN I THINK ALL OF IT IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY I THINK ALL OF US WOULD PROBABLY DO WELL IF WE BRUSHED UP ON OUR CONSTITUTION AS WELL AS OUR PROCEDURES AND THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME MAY I SUGGEST THAT WE MAKE A REQUEST THAT WE SUSPEND THE CERTIFICATION OF THE VOTE PENDING FURTHER INQUIRY INTO THIS MATTER BUT FOR PURPOSES THE TONIGHT MOVE ON WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE AGENDA IN THE POST MIDNIGHT. VOTES AND REVISIT THIS AT AN APPROPRIATE POINT BUT NOT CERTIFIED THE VOTE UNTIL WE RECONCILE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER BURGESS AND I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING AGAIN WE'RE OUR BELIEF IS AN ANSWER TO A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY IS NOT A DECISION AND THEREFORE. CANNOT BE APPLIED. LADIES AND THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL LEADER GROVE CENTER BARGES AND ALL THOSE. WHO VANTUR NOT GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD INTO OUR UNFINISHED BUSINESS FOR THE EVENING. THERE ARE THREE MISTER PRESIDENT I BELIEVE THAT WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED AS A POINT OF ORDER. THERE WERE JUST- FOR WHAT PURPOSE. WHY I BELIEVE THAT POINT THAT POINT OF WATER WOULD HAVE BEEN TO ALLOW US TO REVISIT THIS AT A LATER POINT BY SUSPENDING THE CERTIFICATION OF THE VOTE ON THAT PARTICULAR BILL BUT ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE BILLS. OR JUST WANT TO CLARIFY JUST A PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY OR A POINT OF ORDER. IF THIS WOULD BE A POINT OF ORDER THEM. AND A IN ORDER IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU WHICH RULE YOU BELIEVE WE'RE BREAKING AT THIS POINT ON YOUR POINT OF ORDER. I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT CITATION ON THE ON THE PARLIAMENTARY RULE THAT I COULD INVOKE RIGHT NOW. BUT I SUSPECT IT WOULD BE. THAT IF THERE IS. LEGAL DISAGREEMENT. AS WELL AS PROCEDURAL DISAGREEMENT THERE MUST BE A WAY TO PRESERVE THE RIGHTS. OF THE PARTIES THAT BELIEVE FURTHER INQUIRY AND RESEARCH ARE APPROPRIATE. BUT ALLOW US TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS TO FINISH OUT. THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR THE CALENDAR AGENDA. I SO I ASKED MAYBE BERNIE OR OTHERS TO FILL IN THE BLANKS ON HOW THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE APPROPRIATE. LANGUAGE BUT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. OR JUST THANK YOU. FOR YOUR POINT OF ORDER- WE BELIEVE THAT THE ROLL CALL THAT WAS OPEN WAS PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT- AND THAT IS OUR FINAL DECISION THE C. WHEN I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON TO- UNFINISHED BUSINESS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.

DROPPED THE BALL OF THE STATE AS STAFF IT WAS THAT THE TRIBES DEAD AND THERE'S ENOUGH BLAME TO GO AROUND BUT THIS LEFT INDIGENOUS SACRED SITES VULNERABLE TO DESECRATION WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO CONSULTATION PROVIDED TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN SICK BUT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. SO AFTER TWO YEARS AGO SHE TIONS OF AMENDMENTS THE RESULT HAS BEEN AB ONE SIX EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES HAVE CONSTRUCTED THIS PROPOSAL THAT RESPECTS TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY BY ALLOWING MOST PROJECTS TO STILL ENTER STREAMLINING. WITH THAT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS HEREBY CASKEY DO A DISCUSSION OR DEBATE GOOD EVENING CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SIXTY AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR IT. SEES ME I TODAY TONIGHT AS IS THERE THIS MORNING I GUESS- AND FOR THOSE ON THE HOUSING COMMITTEE- YOU ARE OF COURSE ALREADY AWARE. AT THIS WAY AS A VERY- SO DIFFICULT BILL AND A DIFFICULT. PROCESS WHEN WE CRAFTED SB THIRTY FIVE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS THE SENATOR FROM FREMONT NOTED HI. NO ONE ASLAUG THIS ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR SACRED SITES NO ONE NOT THE TRIBES NO COMMITTEE THAT IT WENT THROUGH NO ONE. AND OF COURSE- WE NEED TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION. FOR THESE CULTURAL RESOURCES THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- NOW THIS BILL I WILL BE HONEST AS MEMBERS OF HOUSING VIDEO MY VIEW IS THAT THERE ARE ON SOME CHALLENGES WITH THIS BILL I DON'T LOVE THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED. IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS- THE TRIBES ESSENTIALLY HAVE VETO POWER OVER WHETHER PROJECTS CAN. ANSWER SB THIRTY FIVE AND THERE IS NO LEGAL REMEDY AT ALL IF SOMEONE DISAGREES. WITH THAT CONCLUSION- SADDAM HAS BEEN MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS BILL- BUT ON BALANCE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE BILL. I HAVE NO CONCERNS WHATSOEVER ABOUT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE- NATIVE AMERICAN- NEIGHBORS- THEY HAD A CAMPAIGN OF EXTERMINATION OF GENOCIDE- OF EXPULSION OF FORCED ASSIMILATION- PUT. ON THEM FORCE ON THEM. AND WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE ALLY TO AND TO HELP LIFT UP OUR NEIGHBOR NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES- INTO PRODUCTION SO TO PROTECT WHAT IS LEFT. OF THEIR HERITAGE- AND SO ON BALANCE ON BECAUSE OF THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER BASINGER THE SENATE WITH ACTIVITY SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE FINAL CALL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.
