ZERO I'D LIKE. ONE TO THE BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW COMMITTEE. IN RECENT YEARS A STATUS TAKEN ACCESS TO ADDRESS THE ON HOUSE CRISIS THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF HOUSING RELATED BILLS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING VIA SENATE BILL. TWO THIS COMMITTEE ALSO INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN COMBATING HOMELESSNESS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS INCLUDING MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT EMERGENCY AID TO LOCAL ENTITIES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. BUT WE ARE ALL CLEAR MORE MUST BE DONE. THE HOMELESS CRISIS IS NOT GONE AWAY AND THE STATE NEEDS TO FIND A WAY TO MOVE PAST THE EMERGENCY ACT AS OF THE LAST TWO YEARS AND MAKE REAL PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE CRISIS GRIPPING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ADMINISTRATIVE PROPOSED A NUMBER OF AMBITIOUS PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH THIS PRESSING ISSUE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. THIS HEARING WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THESE PROPOSALS AT A TEN THOUSAND LEVEL BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DELVE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR I COULDN'T AGREE MORE SEEING THE CORE ISSUES OF POVERTY YEAR GOT TO BE AT THE FRONT OF MIND FOR ALL OF US. WILL GO HERE BEGIN TODAY ON THE INVITE THE FIRST PANEL UP. AGAIN UNDERSECRETARY- BASS- I'VE SKIPPED RIGHT INTO THE MEAT OF THE HEARING LET'S START WITH THE FIRST PANEL. WILL PROVIDE US CONTACT AN UPDATE ON RECENT INVESTMENTS WILL HEAR FROM LORD OF MORALIS. FROM THE OILS OFFICE ALLEY CERTAIN DEBBIE SIX REFER HOMELESSNESS BUSINESS CONSUMER ASSIST AND HOUSING AGENCY. WELCOME AND THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SENATORS UNDER THIS MORALIS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED I ASKED TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR THE COMMITTEE AS YOU. CONSIDER THE STATE'S APPROACH TO RESPOND HOMELESSNESS. I'LL BE MAKING COMMENTS FROM THIS HAND OUT AND LEAVE YOU HAVE IN YOUR BRIEFING MATERIALS. SO MY NOTING THAT WHILE HOMELESSNESS IS A COMPLEX PROBLEM WITH MANY CAUSES THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIANS SPENT- YOUR SHARE OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND HOUSEHOLD IN THE REST OF THE NATION AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FIGURE ON THE FIRST PAGE OF. OUR HOUSING. COSTS CD WAIT. FOR LOW INCOME HOUSE. HAVE PUT ADDITIONAL STRESS ON INDIVIDUALS- FIFTY POTENTIALLY FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE ONE POINT FIVE. MILLION HOUSEHOLDS THAT PAY AT LEAST HALF OF THEIR- INCOME ON RENT SO FOR THE POPULATION. AN UNEXPECTED- SIXPENCE OR JOB LOSS COULD RESULT IN HOMELESSNESS. ON THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT YOU SEE SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION DO YOU SEE THAT AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE HOMELESS THIS IS BASED ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNTS. THIS IS ABOUT 27% OF THIS TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION ACROSS THE NATION. YOU SEE THAT THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION IS IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THERE'S FIFTY SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HOMELESS. AND ABOUT POPULATION IN THE STATE IS CHRONICALLY LESS. ON PAGE THREE WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION AMONG THE- ALONG THE STATE. YOU SEE THAT THE SEVEN. LEGIONS OF IDENTIFIED ON THE MAP HOLD AROUND TWO THIRDS OF THE TOTAL HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE STATE WELL THE REMAINING ONE THIRD ABOUT FORTY NINE THOUSAND OURS. AROUND TO THE REST OF THE AREAS. CALIFORNIA WE DO KNOW THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE LIKELY UNDER COUNTY GIVEN CHALLENGES WITH A DOING THE POINT IN TIME COUNT ACCURATELY THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH THE TRAP TORY NATURE OF THE POPULATION AS WELL AS CHALLENGES AND CAP ALL DIMENSIONS OF HOMELESSNESS TO FOR EGGS BUT JUST OUR COUCH SERAPHINE OUR FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN THAT HOUSE JUST THE CATCHER IN THE POINT IN TIME ACCOUNTS. AND LOCAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS SO WE SEE THAT THE STATE RELATED HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM'S REALLY FALL INTO THREE MAIN. TYPES OF RESPONSE THE FIRST- TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT HELP BUILD NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THIS IS- THINGS LIKE TAX CREDITS THEN WE SEE THE STATE ALSO OPERATING PROGRAMS THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS AFFORD HOUSING IS ARE THINGS LIKE VOUCHER PROGRAMS ANOTHER RENTAL SUBSIDIES. WE ALSO SEE THAT THE STATE OPERATES HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT MAY NOT DIRECTLY PROVIDE HOUSING SERVICES BUT BY HELP. OF SAUSAGE PROVIDE DRESS. BUT PROGRAM ARE OPERATE IN THIS USING SERVICE AS WELL AS FEDERAL. AND ARE ADMINISTERED AT VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE SO WE SEE. THE HOUSING AND URBAN I'M SORRY EACH CD HAVE ROLE WE SEE A HOMELESSNESS SO HAVE A ROLE HERE AND WE ALSO SEE ROLES FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CDC ARE IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS AS WELL. AND ALL THAT FOR THESE PROGRAMS SIX AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING TO THE SHIFT FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT MORE. FUNDING BASED ON TIME AUGMENTATIONS. AND SO ON THE FIFTH PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL RULE AND SO WE DO KNOW THAT MOST OF THE HOMELESS SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL USING STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL. THIS IS BASED ON LOCALS HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION COMMITTEE AND OUR STATE IN THEM TO MAKE THE DECISION. WHAT SERVICES BEST SUIT THAT. IN FEDERAL FUNDS IN SOME CASES IDENTIFYING THEIR OWN YOU REVENUE SOURCES AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING POLICIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS OF FOR EXAMPLE MAKING THE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING POLICIES OR RENT STABILIZATION POLICIES IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES TO HELP ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. ON PAGE SIX WE HAVE A FIGURE THAT OUTLINED SOME OF THE MAJOR RECENT STATE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS SO WE HAVE THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME. THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD AUTHORIZED BY THE VOTERS THAT MADE A TWO BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE. FOR PERMITS A PART OF HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MENTALLY ILL. AND THEN WE SEE A TWO PROPOSALS THAT IN NEXT PANELIST WILL SPEAK ON IN PROVIDING AN UPDATE WHERE. WERE BILLION DOLLARS MADE LEVEL TWO CITIES COUNTIES CANYONS OF CARE TO PROVIDE A NUMBER. IS PRIME. I IF. LESS IT'S ON THE FINAL PAGE OF THE I WANTED HER TO TRANSITION TO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FREE MARKET HAS A TO THINK THROUGH NEXT AT. THE LEDGE HAS DEMONSTRATED IN IN HOMELESSNESS THROUGH SORT OF- YOU KNOW THE APPLICATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RISE IN RECENT YEARS. CHRIS AGAIN EVEN SAID. INVEST COULD BE MADE WITHOUT SHOWING MUST BUDGET PROGRESS OF THERE'S NOT A STRATEGIC APPROACH IN HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. AND SO THIS IS A FINAL PAGE LAYS OUT. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSENT AS YOU START FORMING YOUR PLAN FOR THE SUBSEQUENT EARS ON ABOUT HOW YOU IDENTIFY GOALS IN UNDERSTANDING THE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN A BROAD APPROACH AND MORE FOCUSED APPROACH WHERE A BROAD APPROACH- COULD PROVIDE WORK MORE GREATER MORE RELIEF SOARED ACROSS THE BOARD BUT WHAT CONNECTICUT. OF HE SPOKE PACIFIC. A WAS A THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU THINK THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE YOU KNOW FOR ORDER PRIOR ARE IN THE NEAR TERM. SOLUTIONS ALIGNED WITH THOSE GOALS OF FOR APPLE IF ONE OF YOUR FIRST PRIORITIES MIGHT BE TO. FOCUS ON PREVENTION. EMERGENCY SHELTERS OUT ONE THAT WITH A LINE A SISTERLY WITHOUT YOU CALLED. IMPORTANT YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATE. AND LOCAL RELATIONSHIP WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. ISN'T INTERESTED MAINTAINING THE CURRENT ROLE WHERE THE STATE PROVIDES INTO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR HOW THEY RESPOND OR- LIKE TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE. ROLE AND HELP. THOSE POLICY DECISIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE GIRL AND STRUCTURE AT THE STATE LEVEL SHOULD. BE RESPONSIVE TO THOUGH THE DECISION TO ULTIMATELY MAKE FOR THE QUESTIONS ABOVE AND THE FUNDING STRATEGY NEEDS TO LINE AS WELL BUT WHETHER ONE TIME OR ONGOING SOURCES ARE BEST SUITED FOR THE- THIRTIES THE HOPE TO ADDRESS. AND ULTIMATELY ANY PROPOSAL NEEDS TO HAVE GUESTS OVERSIGHT THAT BOTH TRACKS PROGRESS. WE HAVE TAKEN QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACTUALLY GONNA HOLD QUESTIONS- COLLEAGUES TO END OF ALL THREE PANELS PLEASE THANK. I'M THE ALISON FROM THE HOMES CANADIAN FINANCING COUNSELORS IN A REALLY GREAT JOB OF SORT OF PROVIDING A LOT OF THE CONTEXT OF WHERE WE'RE AT IT'S GOING TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE DETAILS OF. SOME OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE AND ONE THING I JUST DO WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED IN HIS STATUS AS WELL OVER AS WERE THINKING ABOUT TRENDS AND STATISTICS ARE ON HOMELESSNESS POPULATIONS.

CONNECT ANYTHING AND SO IS MADE UP OF EIGHTEEN COUNCIL MEMBERS AM A HANDFUL ABOUT ELEVEN FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S- A COUPLE FORMALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA TO LOCAL CONSUMER CARE PRESENTED AND TO STATE ADVOCATES- WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF PRIORITIES AND I THINK ARE IMPORTANT IT JUST ALL OUT HERE VERY QUICKLY- BEING- THAT THE STATE WHAT HOMELESS THE WAREHOUSE AT THE GOVERNMENT STATUS ARE WORKING VERY ACTIVE.

THERE'S WAS THIS SIX NINETY MILLION TOTAL FIVE TO BE AND- DRAMATIC CALIBER PROPOSAL OVER TO A CAL A CAL AMY BROAD INTENDED TO PROVIDE MORE CALM CARE TO WITH COMP NEED AND INTO I MET CAL WORKS HOME YES AND MEDICARE PILOT PROGRAM AT THE MINISTRY HOSP. THANK POINT SIX NOT NORTH AND IS INITIATIVE ESTABLISH A SIX YEAR PINE PRO INTO THREE TO FOR INCENTIVES TO TREAT AND SIR INTO DEAN INST COMPETENT TO TRIAL IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE EFFORTS COM TO PASS. IN IN. OUR DESIRE DETAILS THE STATE OBISPO. I WOULD LIKE TO VOTE MY ROOM ON A TO HOW IMPROVE THE TO THE FIRST TWO PROPOSALS MENTION. REFLECT IN ON PRESS AND APPROACH TO ADDRESSING. AND USING MEDI CAL AS A TOOL TO BUILD EQUITY ACROSS ARE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. WE ARE PROCEEDS SOME DIFFERENT SOMETHING BROWN SOMETHING IN MY- HERE'S THE CASE. MISTER JONES IS A FOR FIVE YEAR OLD HOME INTO WHO SLEEP UNDER A BRIDGE IN LOS ANGELES. GET THE LONG HISTORY EMERGING ROOM USAGE AND OCCASIONAL SHORT ADMISSIONS FOR HIS POORLY CONTROLLED DIABETES. HE IS A CLEAR ENDS ID DISORDER BUT HAVEN'T HAD MEDICATIONS WITH ANY CONSISTENCY BECAUSE HE STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN STRUCTURE AND POSITIVE HABITS. HIS TWENTY YEAR OLD DAUGHTER VISITS HIM ON THE STREETS BUT SHE'S JUST GETTING HER ON HER FEET AND DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME TO HELP AS MUCH AS YOU'D LIKE. MR NEEDS IT IS. SUPPORT SIR. REGULAR AND RELIABLE PRIMARY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE AND A HOME. HOW DOES MR JONES GET THESE AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO A YEAR FROM NOW. FIRST SINCE MISTER JONES IS IN A MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLAN WITH HEALTH NET HE HAS ACCESS BY VIRTUE OF HIS HOMELESSNESS AND IT'S CHRONIC CONDITIONS TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AS PART CAL AIMED. HERE HE SHOULD HAVE A CASE MANAGER WHO IS SUPPORTING HIM TO NAVIGATE HIS HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND ENSURE HE CAN STAY COMPLIANT WITH MEDICATION REGIMEN. TWO SINCE MISTER JONES IS MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE AGAIN WITH HEALTH NET HE'S ELIGIBLE FOR IN LIEU OF SERVICES BUNDLE FOCUSED ON TENDENCY SUPPORT SERVICES TO HELP HIM FIND HOUSING. APPLY FOR AND SECURE A LEASE FOR HOUSING AND THE MANAGES MOVE AS HE MOVED INTO THE HOUSING. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY A NONPROFIT COMEDIAN HOUSING ORGANIZATION THAT IS CONTRACTED WITH HEALTH NET TO PROVIDE THESE IN LIEU OF SERVICES TO MISTER JONES. AND FINALLY BE WE KNOW THAT ANY A PLACE TO LIVE IS ONE. AND AFFORD IT IS A WHOLE OTHER THING MISTER JONES BENEFIT THIS DAY SUPPORTED FIND IT. HOUSING CALIFORNIA OUTFIT TO HOUSING FIND. THIS FUN HELP PAVE POOR OF HIS RENT AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SOME HIS ABILITY TO FIGHTS INCOME TOWARDS. BECAUSE OF THIS BUT- LOCAL ENTITIES COME INTO THE- OF HELL FINE HOUSING. WOULD LAND. WE WILL. WORK WITH. ULTIMATELY HELPS MISTER JONES SIX HOUSING IS ALSO THE HEALTH NET IN LIEU OF SERVICE PROVIDER THAT IS FINE TO BE AT THE CAL AIMED PROPOSAL. TOGETHER THE MEDI CAL BENEFITS OF ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND HOMELESS IN LIEU OF SERVICES UNDER CAL AIMED ALONG WITH THE pRENTAL SUBSIDY SUPPORT FROM THE FUND HOT MISTER JONES NOT ONLY GET HOUSING. BUT MOVE MOVE IN AND SUCCEED IN HIS NEW HOUSING. IF EVER MISTER JONES WAS GOING TO HAVE A SHOT AT GETTING AND STAYING OFF THE STREETS EIGHT OUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOMS THE TRI FACTOR OF THESE EFFORTS MAKE IT MUCH MORE LIKELY. THE WHOLE PERSON FOCUS NATURE THE SERVICES BLANK THE FUNDING AT A LEVEL FOR MISTER JONES SAID THAT EVEN THOUGH VARIETY OF FINDINGS COME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT MISTER JONES. COUNTY MEETING HOUSING HE ONLY KNOWS THAT HIS PRIMARY. ALSO THE DOES THE CARE PROVIDER. THAT HE CONTRAST HOW'S THIS PROVIDER THAT IS EAGER TO WORK WITH HIM AND SIX EIGHT. RIGHT. THE THAT PULLS. BECAUSE THE HOUSING SEPARATE CITY IS BUILT WITH STATE GENERAL FUND AND OTHER COUNTY AND HEALTH PLAN AND POTENTIALLY PRIVATE AND PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS THE COST OF THE HOUSING IS NOT ONLY ONE ENTITIES BURDEN THIS MODEL BUILDS ON THE NOTION THAT MISTER JONES IS A MEMBER OF A HEALTH PLAN AS IS A RESIDENT OF THIS AND COUNTY. HOW FANS CAN AND SHOULD INVEST IN THE FUND BECAUSE THEY WELL UNDERSTAND THAT CASE MANAGEMENT AND SORT SUPPORT SERVICES WITHOUT A REALLY HOUSE REAL HOUSING OPTION IS MOSTLY INEFFECTIVE. THE FACT THAT THE FUND HAS BEEN BUILT ON AS AN ONGOING INVESTMENT VEHICLE ALSO MEANS THAT ONGOING RENTAL SUBSIDY FUNDS TO SUPPORT MISTER JONES TO STAY HOUSE. ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FLOW THEM PRIOR EFFORTS THAT PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDING FOR JURISDICTIONS TO SOLVE WHAT IS KNOWN. WHAT IS OUR LONG STANDING AND ONGOING PROBLEM OF MR HOMELESSNESS FOR MISTER JONES. THE BEST NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S THROUGH THE REFORMS DESCRIBED ABOVE IS BOYS NOT JUST TO DO THIS FOR MISTER JONES. FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO EXPERIENCES HOMELESSNESS AND DEPEND ON MEDI CAL FOR HEALTH COVERAGE. THIS EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTS THE CLEAR OPPORTUNITY THESE PROVIDE PROPOSALS ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO EACH OTHER AND REALLY FORM A NEW WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS THAT I KNOW CONTINUE TO BE RAISED WHITE AGES AT HHS AND Y. DSS. AND WHY REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS. WHITE HHS. AS YOU KNOW A TEACHERS OVERSEES AND COORDINATES THE SAFE STATE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WE ARE DESIGNING OR PROGRAMS TO SEE THE WHOLE PERSON AND WE SEE HOUSING AS A VITAL COMPONENT TO SEEN. THE WHOLE PERSON. HOUSING TO THE DRIVER OF HEALTH AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE CASE EXAMPLE I JUST DISCUSSED. WITHIN HHS. DOES IS ARC Q. LEADER ON HOUSING AND HOMELESS PROGRAMS AND DIRECTOR JOHNSON WILL SPEAK TO WHY AT SOCIAL SERVICES. WHY REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HOMELESSNESS KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES CITY OR COUNTY LINES WHEN ENTITIES IN A REGION SUCH AS CITIES ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER. WORK ON SILENT SILO PROJECTS AND LACK COORDINATION ON A PROJECT WE GET NO WHERE WE HAVE EXAMPLES ACROSS THE STATE WERE ONE CITY IS SPENDING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND THE NEIGHBORING CITY IS DOING NOTHING. IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHEN NEIGHBORING CITIES BEHAVE SO DIFFERENTLY. THE GOAL OF HAVING A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE IS THAT EVERYONE IS IN AND PART OF THE PROCESS WE WANT THIS FIND AND IT'S REGIONAL APPROACH TO INCENTIVIZE CITIES AND COUNTIES. TO THE TABLE TO WORK TOGETHER. NOTHING WILL CHANGE IF WE ALLOW EVERY CITY AND OR COUNTY TO CONTINUE TO GET GUARANTEED FUNDING THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. VERY BAD. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I WILL FOCUS ON THAT FUND PROPOSAL THAT HAS JUST BEEN OUTLINED THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THIS FIND ARE TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY MOVING ALGEBRA ELIGIBLE PERSONS INTO AFFORDABLE PERMANENT HOUSING AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PERMANENT HOUSING UNITS AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK HOMELESSNESS THE FUND WILL PUSH THESE PURPOSES IN THREE WAYS THE FIRST PART ANYHOW RELATED ANGELES SINCE ORDER POT AND RENTAL SUCH AS- THE SECOND STABLE. ADULT DENTAL FACILITIES RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND THE THIRD DEVELOPING UNITS WHETHER NEWLY BUILT OR CONVERTED FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING THE FUND WILL TAKE THE REGIONAL APPROACH THAT YOU JUST HEARD THE UNDERSECRETARY DESCRIBE RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES OF MOVING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO HOUSING OFTEN CUT ACROSS CITY AND COUNTY LINES. REQUIRE REQUIRED BROUGHT XIN. BOTH LOCAL. AND NON PROFITS MAY APPLY TO SERVE AS THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR A GIVEN REGION. SINCE DIFFERENT READ REACH DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENTITIES MAY BE BEST POSITIONED TO DELIVER THE GOALS OF THE FUND DEPENDING ON THAT REGION. REGIONAL MINISTERS WILL BE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR ABILITY AND TRACK RECORD AND EVALUATED AND HELD ACCOUNTABLE ACCORDING TO CLEARLY DEFINE METRICS. THE FUND WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR THE SERVICES CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES INSTEAD IT WILL FOCUS DIRECTLY ON THE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF UNITS AND ENABLE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. TO MOVE AND STAY IN THESE UNITS THESE EFFORTS WILL ENABLE CITIES COUNTIES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY DO BEST. IN A SOCIAL SERVICES WILL DEVELOP A DATA COLLECTION REPORTING PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND EVALUATION FRAMEWORK TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FUN. THE FRAMEWORK FOR MICHAEL AS I HAD MENTIONED WILL HAVE CLEAR METRICS SOME OF THOSE MAY INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF NEW LEASE IS SIGNED TO THE END OF THE NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING UNITS CONVERTED OR BUILT. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS- STABILIZE TO RENT SUBSIDIES THE NUMBER OF INTO IT BUT THE MOVE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO HOUSING. AND THE CONNECTIONS MADE TO OTHER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. WE WILL DESIGN THIS FRIEND IN DATA COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN COORDINATION WITH THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY. DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND THIS IS SUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. DIFFERENT WORK WILL BE AND- I DIDN'T. REQUEST OKAY FOR THREE. STRAIGHT WE REQUESTED THAT WE ASK CAN WE BELIEVE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE- REPLICATE. I CAN BE REAL. SOON DURING AND THE KEY. CAN BEGIN WORKING ON THESE PLANS RESPONSE AND TO PUT THE PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THE FUND HAS ALREADY RECEIVED. LINK FORTY FIVE DOLLARS FROM KAISER KAISER PERMANENTE A AND BLUE SHIELD. THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO FINALIZE THE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT IN THE FUND THE SPRING THE ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. AS REFERENCE BY UNDERSECRETARY BOSS THE FUND WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT AS THE OP- AT THE STATE SAFETY NET HOUSING SUPPORTS IN QUIET SINCE PROGRAMS THIS DEPARTMENTS WELL POSITIONED TO SUPPORT HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR HOMELESS POPULATION. KEEPING THE HOUSE BILL THE THAT IS THE STATION FOR ALL OTHER LIFE EXPERIENCE OUTCOMES. PART OF THE SERVICES FOR A FOR EVERYONE'S BENEFIT IN THIS LEGISLATURE HAS AGREED TO ADD COMMIT SERVICES IN THE PAST IT CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS FIVE PROGRAMS IN THE HOUSING HOMELESS SPACE ASSISTING CHILDREN FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS- ALSO SERVES WITHIN CERTAIN POPULATIONS OF THOSE INCLUDE FAMILIES PARTICIPATING IN OUR CAL WORKS PROGRAM.

A SUITE OF HOUSING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO ADDRESS THIS SAYS THREE WE PUT TOGETHER CAL TO IT MANY THINGS. IT WOULD YES THE WHITE FORM TO ADDRESS THOSE I. KING IT FROM VERY GOOD PIE. BUT LEARNING THOSE BEST. IN TAKING TO SCALE STATEWIDE. I WILL WALK THROUGH THOSE COMPONENTS- AT A HIGH LEVEL THE FIRST ONE BEING ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR A LARGE VARIETY OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. IT ALLOWS FOR PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH COUNTY'S PUBLIC HOSPITALS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO ST BASED OUTSIDE OF THE FOUR WALLS ENGAGEMENT WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. IT ALSO WOULD IT NOT ONLY FOCUS ON HIGH YOU LETTERS OF MEDICAL COSTS ABOUT MAYBE FOCUS IT WILL ALSO FOCUS ON UNDER UTILIZED OF.

RENTAL SUBSIDIES OR RENT WE CAN PAY FOR THOSE WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO ENSURE SOMEONE GETS HOUSE AND CAN STAY HOUSE. THERE ARE OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE VERY COMPLEMENTARY TO THIS FOR EXAMPLE RETRIBUTIVE CARE IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL- RECEIVING TREATMENT- AND WE NEED TO GET THEM DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A HOME TO GO TO. A PHYSICIAN MAY NOT JUSTICE CHARGE SOMEONE TO THE STREET OFTENTIMES HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS CAN RESIDE IN AN INPATIENT SETTING FOR EXIT A VERY VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME WE LONG WITH THIS NECESSARY FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO BE DISCHARGED. RECOUP CARE IS OPTION OF SERVICE PACKAGE. IS THE TODAY PLEADED. IN IN. SETTING FOR UP TO NOW DAYS TO GET SOME CLINICAL SIR IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO ENGAGE EARLY TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND CONNECT THEM TO POTENTIAL HOUSING OP OPPORTUNITIES IN FRONT OF THEM. THE OTHER PIECE WHICH IS IN THERE IS CALLED DAY HABILITATION PROGRAMS THIS ALLOWS. CITIES OR AREAS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR CONSTANT COMMUNICATION A PLACE TO MEET INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS ON THE STREETS TO ENGAGE THEM AROUND PERSONAL SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT. DAILY LIVING SKILLS AS WELL AS CONNECTING UP TO THE VERY SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. ONE PIECE IT'S ALSO INCLUDED IN CALLIN IS INCENTIVES BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS A LARGE AMBITION THERE IS A LOT TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS VERY LARGE. SO THERE IS INCENTIVE DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR PROPOSAL TO HELP US BUILD STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE WE DO HAVE GAPS THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY THINKING THROUGH HOW WILL WE INCENTIVIZE THE RIGHT THINGS TO BUILD THESE GAPS STATEWIDE. AND THE NEEDLE. THESE SERVICES WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE STREETS LEAVING INSTITUTIONS AND CORRECTIONAL OPPORTUNITY- FACILITIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW FOR THE WAY THAT WE HAVE BUILT THIS PROGRAM. TO CATCH THEM TO ALL OF THOSE VARIOUS POINTS WHICH IS A CRITICAL PIECE AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WEIRD PEOPLE MAY FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS AND TAKING MORE PREVENTIVE AND EARLY INTERVENTION.

FIFTY SIX THOUSAND FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS 75% OF WHOM WERE ON SHELTERED. SPIKE CONTINUED INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS THE ADDITION OF LOCAL RESOURCES HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL ESSENTIAL IN MEETING FURTHER INCREASES IN LA. HOMELESSNESS IN LA C. O. C. ROSE BY 7% BETWEEN. EIGHTEEN AND- IN. EIGHT OF EIGHT WHITE INCREASE WHICH WAS 14% OVER THAT PERIOD. LAST YEAR OUR SYSTEM MADE MORE THAN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PERMANENT HOUSING PLACEMENTS THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY I'M MORE THAN 81% INCREASE FROM OUR PLACEMENT RATES TWENTY IN. THIS MENDOZA GRASS WERE.

AND OF THAT NUMBER 53% SITE ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING OBJECTIONS JOB LOSS AND RISING RENTS AS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS. IF YOU PLAY A UNIQUE ROLE IN THIS EFFORT- IN LA LHASA IS POSITION BETWEEN CITIES WHICH CONTROL OUR LAND USE AUTHORITIES AND THE COUNTY WHICH ADMINISTERS OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS CEO SEES BRING EVERYONE TO THE TABLE TO. RECORD THE RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A NEW INITIATIVE THAT LOSSES LEADING CALLED HOUSING CENTRAL COMMAND WHICH LOST A LOT LATELY ALL OF THE NINETEEN. PRO TO THE DISASTERS MODEL TO ART READ. THE LARGER OF PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN LA AND RE HOUSING THEM RAPIDLY.

WHAT ISN'T WORKING AND BRING THESE FIND OUR PARTNERS. FINALLY WERE THE ENTITY THAT WORKS TO IMPLEMENT NATIONAL BEST TO SIT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. OVER THE YEARS I'VE LEARNED THAT S EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES LIKE HOUSING FIRST. OUT COM SUCH AS LONG MORE STABLE STAYS IN. HOUSING THE SEES CAN ENSURE THAT THESE BEST PRACTICES MOVE FROM GUIDANCE ON THE GROUND TO PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION.

THE COUNTY OF SAN DINO HAS THE PAPERS EFFORTS TO ALMOST A THE LAST TEN YEARS COUNTY HAS FINANCED OVER THE NEW IT'S AN UNITS IN THE PIPELINE SINCE THE SUMMER OF TWENTY FIFTH ACCOUNT HELP RESOLVE THIS FOR. VETERANS ALL OF THE UNITS AND PART. STATE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND T. TOWNIE PIVOTED AT THE HOW THE F. TO CREATE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNIT. IN PROJECT IS A DISTINCTION OF THE COUNTIES GOAL TO DEVELOP PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THIS PROJECT INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUING HOUSING NEEDS OF THE COUNTY'S HOMELESS CHRONICALLY POPULATION WERE LIVING WITH THE PAIR MENTALLY MENTAL ILLNESS.

STORE NO- HAS THE TO PROVIDE PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS VOUCHERS TO PAY RENT FOR THE PERMANENT PART OF HOUSING UNITS THIS IS BECAUSE- I'M IT'S NOT. THANKS CHURCH THAT CAN BE CONVERTED PROP BASED.

AT AS A TO PLAY THEIR BOXERS THE COUNTIES EFFORT TO SECURE NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING IS HAS ON ONLY AT A ROBOT DUE TO THE COUNTIES AND- TWO. PLACE LIKE HOME THESE DUE TO THE OF ACCESS TO PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS AND OF THIS CURRENT CROP. THIS IMPACT COUNTIES THE HOUSE ARE HOMELESS. AS YOU PROCEED AWAITING THE BUDGET PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS IN THIS BUDGET YEAR AND FUTURE BUDGET YEARS I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO DEVELOP A CAPRI STRATEGY WITH. THE STATE'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE. CREATE SHORT AND LONG TERM MONEY THAT COMMUNITIES CAN RELY UPON TO CARRY OUT THE STATE STRATEGY ON THE LOCAL STRATEGIES THAT REGIONALIZATION NEEDS TO OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. INCENTIVIZE ORGANIC EFFORTS CUSTOMIZED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. MODIFY EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAPITAL PROGRAM THE STATE RUNS TO INCLUDE CAPITAL OPERATING. AS AN ELIGIBLE EXPENDITURE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATING. YOU CONNECTING LOCAL HEALTH NOT HEALTH FUNDING FOR HOUSING OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS CONSOLIDATE YOUR SHORT TERM PROGRAMS INTO UNDER ONE ENTITY TO MAXIMIZE SERVICE DOLLARS TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE COUNTIES OF THE VEHICLE TO COURT RESOURCES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICES. AND WE CANNOT SAY WITH MOST OUT. TO HOUSING AND- NEW UNITS ALL OF WHICH TO BE COUPLED WITH SERVICES I WANT TO THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO AND SEES FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU. BUDGET AND- ANALYSTS IF YOU'VE GOT- WRITTEN TESTIMONY HE WOULD- BE KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE IT WITH THEM THE COMMITTEE STAFF WILL HAVE ACCESS TO IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH ONE DOES NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM CHIFFON QATARI- FROM MARIPOSA COUNTY HEALTH HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY ON THIS CRITICAL TOPIC. SORRY DIRECTOR HELPING HUMANS. AGENCY FROM MARIPOSA COUNTY. AND MY COLLEAGUES AND I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR LONG TIME LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE MADAM CHAIR AS WELL AS THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME. AS SHOWN IN HIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS RECENTLY. AS A HUMAN IS EIGHT ZERO. AND AS A RURAL COMMUNITY I WEAR MANY HATS I AM THE SOCIAL SERVICES DIRECTOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR. AS WELL AS OVERSEEN SENIOR SERVICES VETERANS SERVICES HOUSING AND HOMELESS PROGRAMS AND OUR WHOLE PERSON CAN PROGRAM. FURTHERMORE NOT FASTER IS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE EXACERBATED THE HOMELESS CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITY. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE C. W. D. A LEADERSHIP TEAM HAVING SERVED AT THE AS ITS TWENTY NINETEEN PRESIDENT. IN OVERSEEING THE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS I DO I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO ONE FACED A HOMELESS MAN SOON AS A RESULT WE CANNOT HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH INSTEAD REQUIRE AN INTER WOVEN CONTINUUM OF SERVICES SUPPORTS AND HOUSING TYPES. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE DIVERSE INDIVIDUAL GOALS THAT WE SERVE. ALTHOUGH THE NEEDS OUT PACE THE RESOURCES WE HAVE SEEN MANY SUCCESSES IN MY SMALL COUNTY AND WE ATTRIBUTE THOSE TORE HIGHLY INTEGRATED APPROACH TO CARE. THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE STATE'S CREATION OF TARGETED HOUSING SERVICES WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE INCLUDING CAL WORK. CHILD WELFARE PROTECTIVE SERVICES GENERAL ASSISTANCE WHOLE PERSON CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. WE APPRECIATED THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP TO KNOWLEDGE THE M. SEVEN VETTING HELPS AND SUPPORTS WITHIN CRITICAL PROGRAMS ARE. SEVERAL PAIRS. YOUR POST COUNTY AS A GROWING ELDERLY POPULATION. WITH 36% OF OUR RESIDENTS BEING OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY. LOCALLY AND STATEWIDE WE ARE NOW DEALING WITH SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING HOUSING AND SECURITY AMONG OUR OLDER RESIDENTS RESEARCH BY DR TO SHELL OF UCSF FINDS THAT ADULTS OVER FIFTY ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SECTOR OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. THE VAST MAJORITY ARE ALL I'M NEWLY HOMELESS DUE TO ECONOMIC REASONS THAT HAVE COME AN INFECTION OR BOARD. FORCED OUT OF HAVE SEEN. HOME WITHOUT. CARRIES A BETTER RISK MUCH GREATER RAY TO THIS POPULATION EITHER FALLING ILL OR DYING PREMATURELY AND HAS SIGNIFICANT RAMIFICATIONS ON OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED SEARCH ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS WHICH THE WTA WHOLE HEARTEDLY SUPPORTS WELL THE STUDY WILL GIVE US GREATER INSIGHT TO GUIDE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS THERE ARE THINGS YOU COULD DO RIGHT NOW TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THIS ISSUE. FOR YOU CAN LEVERAGE EXIST GRAMS LIKE THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM IN APS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND SERVICES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR SENIORS AND ARE DISABLED ADULTS. BUILDING UPON WHAT WE ALREADY DO WELL WILL ALLOW US TO ATTACK THIS ISSUE HEAD ON WHILE WAITING FOR THE RESEARCH. SECOND WE MUST SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND AND MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS OUR STATE. WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO BE BUILT AND MANY OF THE ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THIS WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING EFFORTS ULTIMATELY NESSA'S REALLY STRIKE AT THE HEART OF THE KING PROBLEM. AT THE SAME TIME THE PEOPLE WE ARE STRUGGLING TO FOR THE PLACES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED HOUSING SUBSIDIES WITH LONG WAITING LISTS THAT RARELY OPEN. LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES MUST BE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO THIS CRISIS WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM OF LONG TERM STATE FUNDED SUBSIDIES. SURE THE FACT A HOT SYSTEM. THIRD ALTHOUGH THE INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS MAKE UP ONLY A QUARTER OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION STATE WIDE WE MUST ADDRESS THIS POPULATION'S COMPLEX NEEDS. FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL BOARDING CARE PROGRAMS DIVERSION PROGRAMS NO PLACE LIKE HOME INVESTMENTS ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AND IN LIEU OF SERVICES WHEN ADMINISTERED CORRECTLY WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESSING THE POPULATION'S NEEDS. FOURTH IS THE ISSUE OF BY AND- WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH IT WILL TAKE TO GET AHEAD OF THIS HOUSING CRISIS. CRITICAL THAT FUNDING BE ONGOING. WHICH GRATEFUL TO HEAR THE GOVERNOR KNOWLEDGE IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. ONE TIME ARE UNCERTAIN FUNDING MAKES IT RISKY AND DIFFICULT TO MAKE MUCH NEEDED LONG TERM INVESTMENTS AND THIS IS CUTE INVESTMENTS TOWARDS ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE LITTLE. OR NO. COST INSTEAD OF MOST EFFECTIVE AND CRITICS. ARE YOUR FRIENDS. THOMAS OF ONGOING FUNDING THROUGH MY YEAR. UNABLE CITY AND HOW. DEVELOPERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PLAN IN A WAY THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME PERSPECTIVES FROM A SMALL RURAL COUNTY. SMALL RURAL COUNTIES HAVE PER CAPITA HOMELESS POPULATIONS THAT OFTEN EQUAL OR EXCEED LARGER COUNTIES BUT OFTEN ONLY A FRACTION OF THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. ARE HOMELESS POPULATION SOURCES OF BREAD OUT OVER LARGER GEOGRAPHIC AREA AS WHICH WAS UNIQUE CHALLENGES. ALTHOUGH THE POINT IN TIME COUNT HAS BEEN ONE WAY TO CALCULATE THE FUNDING RECEIVED WE CANNOT RELY ON THIS MEASURE- OWN MEN KEEP ARE TO. SMALL WORLD UNITIES BECAUSE I WANT TO AVOID BEING. AN ARE COUNTIES OFTEN SEE LESS VISIBLE HOMELESSNESS. SOME COUNTY ALONE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY CAPTURE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND RESULT IN VERY SMALL ALLOCATIONS TO COUNTIES LIKE MINE AMOUNTS OFF TOO SMALL TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES RE REGIONALIZATION AND HIS PLAN. ALTHOUGH WAS TO. SEE WHICH GRAY WHAT STRUCTURE REGION'S ENSURE THAT THE UNIQUE NEEDS O EACH COUNT ARE MAPPED NO MATTER HOW SMALL OR REMOTE WE MAY BE. IN MANY SMALL COUNTIES THERE IS NO STRONG NONPROFIT LEADING THE CHARGE AND SO WE IS COUNTIES HAVE HAD TO DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO TAKE THIS LEAD. I HAVE APPRECIATED SECKER GALLEY AND CDSS DIRECTOR JOHNSON'S WILLINGNESS TO TAKE INPUT ON HOW BEST TO STRUCTURE THESE REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE. I FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MARIPOSA COUNTY CW DA AND SMALL RURAL COUNTIES TODAY AND I'M EXCITED TO SUPPORT THIS. PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO FILE FINALLY WE'LL HEAR FROM MISTER PICCO WHO'S THE CEO OF BILLION CORNER. THANK YOU BOB SO MY NAME IS WHEN TACKLE I'M THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PLAN CORNERS WERE UP FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NON PROFIT WE- WORK STATEWIDE- PRIMARILY IN OUR CAPACITY DEVELOPING OWNING AND MANAGING. OVER TWO HUNDRED. POLICE SUPPLIES RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES- FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND OFTEN COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL MEDICAL CHALLENGES WHO TRANSITIONED OUT OF THE STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS THOSE LARGER INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS WERE CLOSING. OUR PRIMARY HUBS HOWEVER ARE IN SAN FRANCISCO THE INLAND EMPIRE- AND IN LOS ANGELES WHERE WE OPERATE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY AND SIMILAR PROGRAMS. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR MITCHELL AND ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS STAFF AND MYSELF WAS FOR THE TWO TO SHARE. ABOUT THE FLEXIBLE HOW. RATHER NAME FOR AN INTO SCALABLE SET OF EVIDENCE BASED AND FRANKLY COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS- TO HOMELESSNESS AND THE HOUSING CRISIS FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT WE DO BELIEVE CAN BE REPLICATED IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO WHAT IS A FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL. SELECT THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING MODEL THAT'S ENDED HOMELESSNESS FOR NEARLY SEVENTY SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND JUST OVER FIVE YEARS. IT WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP LED BY LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS ENDS. IT'S HELPING FOR HEALTH DIVISION AND OPERATED BY BRINGING CORNERS- THE FLEX FINDS INVESTMENTS. DOUBLE SYSTEM PUBLIC OF MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MANAGED CARE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PLANTER. TO PROVIDE AND MORE WHICH MEANT RENT SUBSIDIES A WHEN SUB MISSED. ONGOING TENDENCY SUPPORTS AN ONGOING INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR LOS ANGELES'S MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WHILE ALSO SPURRING DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRIME IN SUPPORT OF THING AN INTERIM HOUSING. OUR GOAL IS NOT JUST ANOTHER PROGRAM ADDED TO THE WELTER OF EXISTING PROGRAMS MANY MANY OF WHICH ARE WONDERFUL BUT DIFFICULT TO SCALE AND DIFFICULT. DIFFICULT IN THE GATE FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE FLEXIBLE RATHER BE EIGHT SYSTEM LEVEL CHANGE ENHANCING THE ABILITY OF SEALS AND COORDINATE ENTRY SYSTEMS- WILL GO UP AND FILL. HEALTHCARE NONPROFIT AGENCY TO EFFECTIVELY. THIS OPERATIONALIZE HOUSING FIRST VALUES IN LOS ANGELES BRING CORNERS TO GIVE A SENSE OF THE LEVEL OF OPERATE AND IN LOS ANGELES CORNERS MA'AM IS ACTIVE PARTNERSHIP. WITH GREAT PRIVATE LAND AND THAT NUMBER EVER MONTH AND- EIGHTY INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICE PROVIDER AGENCIES AS WELL AS WITH THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE AND TRANSPORT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. AND BOARD CARE ARE MULTIPLE VACANT UNITS AVAILABLE AT ANY GIVEN TIME FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON EXPERIENCING HOME THIS. SO THE IS HOW DOES THE FLEX PULL WORK TO TAP INTO THOSE EXISTING- HOUSING RESOURCES FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. I'LL START BY DESCRIBING A STAFFING MODEL WHICH PROVIDES THREE ESSENTIAL HOUSING REPEATED SERVICES THAT TOGETHER FREE SOCIAL WORKERS IN CASE MANAGERS OF THE BURDEN AND THE REALLY SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE TALENT OF FINDING SECURING. AND PAYING FOR HOUSING FOR THEIR CLIENTELE. FIRST IS A HOUSING ACQUISITIONS TEAM WHICH SPECIALIZES IN LAW AND ORDER IT'S MEANT AND BRINGS A PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE MIND THAT TO CREATE DURABLE LANDLORD PARTNERSHIP AND REAP BIZ. BY PICKING WAIT UNITS AND SECURING THEM VIA A SUITE OF CUSTOMIZED LEGAL INSTRUMENTS WE CREATE A DIVERSE INVENTORY OR PORTFOLIO FOR POOL OF UNITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN REAL TIME. OUR PROGRAM- PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT NAVIGATING TO TRY TO FIND A UNIT OUT THERE SOMEWHERE WE HAVE THE UNITS AVAILABLE. A SECOND TEAM WE CAN SEE SUPPORTS TEAM AND THE POSITION IS CALLED HOUSING COOPER NADER- BY THE ON GOING TENDENCY SUPPORTS FOR EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT WITHIN THE FLEXIBLE. FROM INITIAL HOUSING INTAKE AND ASSESSMENT AND APPLICATION THROUGH UNIT PREVIEWS AND MOVE IN AND THROUGHOUT THEIR TENANCY. HOUSING COORDINATORS ARE THE CRITICAL LIAISON. BETWEEN THE TENANT THE LANDLORD THE CASE MANAGER AND EVEN FUNDERS AND PROACTIVELY RESOLVE HOUSING ISSUES TO PROMOTE LONG TERM HOUSING STABILITY. A THIRD TEAM INSIDE A BRILLIANT CORNERS IN THE FLEXIBLE MODEL WE SIMPLY CALL OUR OPERATIONS TEAM. AND THEY PROVIDE COMPLEX RENT SUBSIDY ADMINISTRATION PROCESS HIGH VOLUMES OF TRANSACTIONS EVERY MONTH INCLUDING URGENT ONE TIME PAYMENTS AT TO SECURITY DEPOSITS OR LANDLORD INCENTIVES- PROCESS APPLICATIONS AN ARRAY OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS. AND PROVIDE- COMPLEX MULTI FUNDER REPORT. AND THE FINAL- STOP PIECE OF THE STAFFING PUZZLE FOR THE FLEXIBLE MODEL IS INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES WITH THESE THREE IN HOUSE- HOUSING SERVICES IN PLACE APRIL IN CORNERS EACH AND EVERY FLEXIBLE PROGRAM IS A PEN SO RECEIVED INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. SEPARATE CAUGHT BY LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES AND AS I MENTIONED PROVIDED BY. ONE OF OVER EIGHTY CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICE AGENCIES IN SOME LIMITED CASES BRING CORNERS ALSO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. THE OTHER CRITICAL- WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENT THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL IS THROUGH A STANDARDIZED PACKAGE OF FINANCIAL TOOLS AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THOSE TODAY THOSE INCLUDE RENT SUBSIDY TO VARYING TYPES MOST CRITICALLY LOCAL. SYMBOL IN SENATE TERM RENT SUBSIDIES THAT ARE THERE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AS LONG AS THEY NEED THEM. EVEN AT HOLD PAYMENTS THIS IS CRITICAL INNOVATION THE ABILITY TO HOLD THE VACANT UNIT FOR A MONTH OR TWO. UNTIL WE CAN MATT SOMEONE WHO IS IN A CRISIS NO LIFE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR EXITING THE SYSTEM MORE SHELTER. MOVING PAYMENTS FOR SECURITY DEPOSITS FIRST MONTH'S RENT AT CETERA MOVING ASSISTANCE FOR HOUSEHOLD GOODS IN UTILITY SET UP. PROPERTY PROVIDER IN STEPS SUCH AS INSPECTION REPAIR FUNDS- OR LEASE SIGNING BONUSES AND LASTLY BUT IT'LL FLEXIBLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THINGS LIKE PASSED TO RENT BOUNCES UNIT REPAIRED DURING TENANCY. ESSENTIALLY A FINE TO RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE AS A LINE ITEM TO ADDRESS EVERY POSSIBLE BARRIER TO. OR WRIST PURSE LONG TERM THINGS THAT TWENTY. I ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE OFTEN SAY IS THE SECRET SAUCE OF THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL WHEN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY ASK US WHAT MAKES IT WORK SO WELL. AND THAT SECRET SAUCE- IT WELL IT'S GOING TO SOUND A LITTLE BORING WE TALK ABOUT IT AS A CRITICAL SET OF GOVERNMENT NONPROFIT PROCUREMENT INNOVATIONS THAT ENABLE US TO FOCUS ON AND SUSTAIN AND HOUSING COMES. MY TALKING ABOUT ON GOING FUNDING FOR A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY FOR INDEFINITE TERM RENT SUBSIDIES INDEFINITE TERM SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE CASE MANAGEMENT BACK TO A FIFTEEN YEAR CONTRACT THAT'S POURTANT BLINK ONE BE ABLE TO BUILD A COUPLE. HOUSING OUT LONG TERM ALSO WHEN WERE- NEGOTIATING WITH THE DEVELOPER FOR A SUPPORT OF HOUSING SIDE OR IN IN FROM HOUSING SITE THEY'RE ABLE TO RELY ON THAT FIFTEEN YEAR COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AWAY. WE HAVE A UNIQUE IT AND STRUCTURE THAT ALLOWS BRING CORNERS TO RAPIDLY PROCESS WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT OVER SX MILLION DOLLARS MONTHLY AND RENT SUBSIDY PAYMENTS. AND THAT'S IN LA COUNTY ALONE WE HAVE SIMILAR THINGS HAPPENING IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- FULL COST FUNDING. FOR EVERY FORM OF CLIENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AS I'VE ALREADY INDICATED. BUT ALSO FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION. FOR RENT SUBSIDY ADMINISTRATION AND FOR COMPLEX DATA MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING. AND REALLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST. A SHARED MINDSET ACROSS GOVERNMENT NONPROFIT PHILANTHROPY HOUSING. THAT EVERYONE LA SIMPLY CALLS WHATEVER IT TAKES. THAT'S THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE NIPPLE MESS THAT'S OFTEN LACKING IN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS DESPITE OUR BEST INTENTIONS. AND IT CAN MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TURNING DOWN A UNIT BECAUSE IT'S ONE DOLLAR A MONTH MORE THAN FAIR MARKET RENTS OR TAKING THAT UNIT DOWN HOLDING IT AND MATCHING IT FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S CURRENTLY LIVING ON THE STREETS- SO IN CONCLUSION. DOES THE FLEX PULL WORK. WHILE THE NUMBERS AND EVALUATIONS BY APT ASSOCIATES AND RAND CORPORATION I THINK TELECOM TELLING STORIES WHEN THE- LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION- TO START A FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY PULL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN- THE GOAL IN THE GOAL IN OUR CONTRACT WAS TO SECURE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED UNITS IN THE FIRST FOUR YEARS. AS YOU'VE HEARD IN JUST OVER FIVE YEARS WE FREE HOUSE TO SEVENTY SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE. AT OUR PEAK EFFICIENCY WITH OUR CASE MANAGEMENT ANOTHER PARTNERS WERE ABLE TO USE- HOUSE OVER TWO HUNDRED- FORMALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS PER MONTH. OUR HOUSING RETENTION RATES RANGE BETWEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND 96% FOR THOSE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE INDEFINITE TERM SUBSIDIES ARE LIVING IN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO GREAT RETENTION RATES AND THESE ARE LONG TERM RETENTION RATES FAR BEYOND- THE STANDARD HUD SIX AND TWELVE. PERIOD WE'RE TALKING MULTI YEAR LONG TERM HOUSING STABILITY- WE'VE DEMONSTRATED PROOF OF CONCEPT BY SECURING INVESTMENTS AND HOUSING OUTCOMES ACROSS FORMERLY SIDE LOAD SYSTEMS AGAIN WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED. PRIVATE LANDLORD HOUSING PARTNERS- AND MULTIPLE GOVERNING AGENCIES TESTING AS WELL AS LA CARE. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS DOCUMENTED I BELIEVE IN THE RAND STUDY. FOR MANY OF THE- MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE ABLE TO RE HOUSE AND SUPPORT THROUGH THE FLEXIBLE FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT ON TENDENCY SUPPORTS AND RENT SUBSIDIES AND CASE MANAGEMENT. THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY CENTS SAVED IN THE HEALTH CARE AND OTHER SYSTEMS- SO WITH THAT- I'LL JUST THANK YOUALL FOR THE UP TO SPEAK ABOUT THE FLAG POLE AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DOT BUG ABOUT IT DURING THE QUESTION. I DO HAVE MEANT THAT I CAN WE BE EXCELLENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU CAN OFFICIALS THUMB THE SERGEANTS I'M GONNA ASK YOU ALL THIS DAY. AND I THINK WHAT THE FOR HOMEINVOLVED- THE FOR TO PASS. IF I COUNTED MY CHAIR CORRECT. I SEE MR ACCOUNTS HE. YEAH DESPITE STORM I'M SURE I HAVE TO LEAVE. HOWEVER I WANTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WERE OPENING UP THE MAYBERRY BRIDGE SHOW- TRANSITIONAL HOUSING CENTER AND ABOUT TWO HOURS AND SAN JOSE SO. I WANT TO BE THERE FOR THAT EXCELLENT- LANGUAGE GONNA BE REAL EXCITED TO SCHOOL SOCIAL HOUSING RIGHT NEXT TO THE NEW BART STATION INCENTIVES ARE EXCELLENT THANK YOU CENTER BAIL YOU DRIVE YOU DRIVE SAFELY FOR SHAKE THAT. OUT THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK THE STAFF- FOR I THINK WITH THAT BUT IF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER PERFECTLY THAT LAST PANEL BECAUSE I THINK IT WAS WONDERFULLY DISBURSING REPRESENTATIVE OF MULTIPLE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE FOR ACTIVE OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE ON AND I WANTED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT- EITHER THIS **** MISS SUTTON IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND AT ALL TO. DO THE THINGS YOU HEARD FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDER THE LAW GOVERNMENT. FOR WE ALL. TO INCREASE TO THIRTY EIGHT NOT A PROBLEM. YOU JUST. I THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO KIND OF WORK ON AYE DE THE ON SORE AND I KNOW THE COOK QUESTION OF WHAT'S RESULT THAT THE LOOK FOR TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON THOSE THOSE DEFINITIONS AND AGAIN. REALLY IT INCLUDES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDES NONPROFITS ARE CONSORTIUM OF THOSE IS THAT THE BROAD DEFINITION OF WHAT A REGIONAL MINISTRY MIGHT BE. AXLE I THINK WE HEARD CONSISTENT MESSAGE THAT THAT WE ALL HERE ON THE PANEL I'M SURE. WITH IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR I DIDN'T. HAVE A PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE AND YOU KNOW MISTER PICKLE I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH. SENATE I THINK MAYBE SIX YEARS GO AND TAKE A TRIP TO UTAH. TO LOOK AT. THE MODEL THAT THEY BUILT ON THAT LED THEM TO SUCCESSFULLY REDUCING THEIR CHRONICLE MOST POPULAR BUT LIKE WITH THE LEFT. OF A COUPLE WHICH LEADS TO LEGISLATION THAT THE- ALMOST FORTY THE COUNCIL I CARED A BILL THE HOUSING FIRST BILL. BUT OTHER PEOPLE LOVE WAS REALLY RECOGNIZING IT'S GOT TO BE. RAFEAL THIS AIN'T. THE THIS IS WAS NO LONGER ON THE FRONT THIS PAGE PER. TOP PAUL GOVERNMENT JOB TO CAN. TO KEEP OUR FOOT IN THE EXCEL. TO CONTINUE TO BE THOSE SUPPORTIVE SERVE TO KEEP PEOPLE HAVE ONCE WE GET OVER EXITE. OF OPENINGS IN RIBBON CUTTINGS WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE OVER TIME THAT WAS CERTAINLY MY TAKE AWAY. THE QUICK OR MOVE ON TO MY LIST OF. I HEARD TWO DATA POINTS TO SPECIFIC DATA POINTS TODAY- THE REFERENCE I BELIEVE IT WAS MISS SUDDEN ETHNOLOGY THAT THE AFTER AMERICA POPULATION CALIFORNIA IS UNDER 8% AND YET STATEWIDE- ARE OVER REPRESENTATION IN THE ON HOUSE- POPULATION IS 30% IN MY HOME COUNTY VALLEY IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT THAT WAS AN INTERESTING DATA POINT. THE SECOND DATA POINT WAS THE YOU KNOW WHO EMERGING ON HOUSE ARE THE PEOPLE OVER FIFTY WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN ON HOUSE BEFORE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE AS WE WENT TO A QUESTIONS TO REALLY TALK ABOUT SINCE THE ALL THE TO DATA POINTS WHAT ARE ARE CPAS STRATEGIES TO DEALING WITH THOSE POPULATIONS. SOME OF SAID THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA BUT THOUGH THE TWO DATA POINTS WE NOW. AND THE NATURAL QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT THERE'S ANYBODY WOULD LIKE START THEIR- I'M GLAD TO KIM JOHNSON SOCIAL SERVICES THAT AND CAN WANT TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL FOR THE FIND. HOW WE'VE ADDRESS SAID DISPROPORTIONAL THE IN THE APP PROPOSAL IS AS WERE LOOKING AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR THE REGION'S- IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE'VE INCLUDED A COMPONENT RELATED TO RACIAL EQUITY. AT RECOGNIZING THIS IS YOU SO THAT THE CONCEPT THERE WOULD BE ADDS WERE LOOKING AT THAT FORMULA WE LOOK AT WAIT SICK AND THAT POPULATIONS WITHIN THESE REGIONS AND MAKE A DIFFERENTIAL THERE TO ADDRESS THAT THE ADDITIONAL NEEDS.% RELATED TO THE OLDER POPULATION AND- THAT FIND PROPOSES- THAT REGION'S WOULD DEFINE WHO THEIR POPULATION TARGETS WOULD BE. HI BUT WITH IN IT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT STATE. PARK PRIORITY POPULATIONS IN THE OLDER ADULTS OUR ELDERS ARE INCLUDED IN THAT. IN ADDITION OF COURSE WITHIN THE THREE PURPOSES OF THE FIND ONE IS REALLY SUPPORTING BACK AS STABILITY FOR. BOARDING FACILITY YEAH THAT'S ALSO WRECK. BAD AT HEART THE CONTINUUM OF SAID YOU'RE OLDER POP SINCE. THIS WAY REST. AT THE WE ARE LOOKING TO OUR DA IN HER TO HOW WE THAT PACKAGE WHEN THE THINGS WE COULD DO IS IDENTIFY VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN TARGET THROUGH THAT INCENTIVE PACKAGE REDUCING SOME OF THE DISPARITIES WITHIN THOSE POPULATIONS. SO IS SOMETHING WE CAN THINK ABOUT AS WE ARE BUILDING OUR INCENTIVE PACKAGE FOR THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES IN THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PORTIONS OF KELLY. AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BECAUSE I KNOW- IT WILL BE VERY COMPETITIVE WE'VE HEARD ALREADY YOU KNOW DON'T FORGET THE SMALL RURAL COUNTIES DON'T FORGET THIS GROUP DOES. THAT GROUP BUT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL BUILD IN SENT THE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. ONLY OPEN REPRESENTED AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE THE CONSTANT REMINDER THAT I'M HAPPY TO SELL BECAUSE BUT ONE. THAT TO GET LOST IN THE OVERALL COMPETITION FOR DOLLARS. OF COURSE YOU KNOW LIMIT DOLLARS TO MEET- AN OVERWHELMING NEED- BUT BUT WE'VE GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THE FACT THAT. REPRESENTED IN THIS CASE IN THIS IN THIS- MORAL. DILEMMA WE ARE EXPERIENCING SO WE'VE GOT TO BE HONEST AND ADDRESS THAT THERE ARE THE FOLKS WHO WANTED TO RESPOND IN A COMMITTEE THE SUDDEN. YES THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO- CW DAY IS WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA ON A PROPOSAL TO ENHANCE THE- ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM. TO SPECIFICALLY SERVE SENIORS AND THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WE FOUND SOME REAL SUCCESS IN ACROSS OUR STATE IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND PROVIDING SOME INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT TO THOSE AT RISK OF LOSING. HOUSING SO WE WOULD WANT SUPPORT UP AS WELL EXCELLENT YES AND I THINK FOR BOTH FOR THE COMMITTEE AND FOR THE STATE IT'S WHO ARE WE TARGET BEING IN RELATIONSHIP TO THEIR UP. TWENTY WO JUST IN COUNTLESS AND BOTH IN. REPRESENTATION AND THE GROWING ON THE SENIORS AND OR THE MOST VULNERABLE AS YOU. THAT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT EXAMPLE WAS BENEFIT OF THIS TYPE. MISTER JONES THE QUESTION TO ASK IS WHAT THAT WORK NBC. IF MISTER JONES IS A SENIOR. YELP THE END OF. THE IN ASSIST. ANYWAY HIM TO ASSIST IN THIS IS THE OUR SOURCE OF RAP. OTHERWISE HE WILL END UP ON THE SO AS YOU AT SEVEN AND MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU HAVE HEARD FROM BILLION CORNERS THE DESIRE TO HAVE A MORE CONSISTENCY IN THE FUNDS ACROSS THE PANEL IT'S REALLY WHO ARE YOUR TARGET POPULATIONS AND HOW YOU SHOULD BE TO SIGN IN PROGRAM FUNDING MECHANISMS. ANY BUILDING PORTABLE HOUSING THE- LIGHT ON A FIFTEEN YEAR COMMITMENT UP OF INCOME ALLOWS THEN THE PROSPECT OF A STATION THE CAPITAL AND THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE IN CREATING PERMANENT SUPPORT OF. AND IF YOU HAVE FOR WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE AND CALM- THAT ARE YOUNGER AND TARGET POPULATIONS THAN SHORTER TERM RENTAL ASSISTANCE SO AS YOU DESIGN YOUR PROGRAM YOU REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. WHO IT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP AND THE BIRTH OF THE TWO. AND IN KEEPING WITH THAT I WAS APPROACHED BY A WOMAN AT A TOWN HALL JUST LAST WEEK- TALKED ABOUT HAVING TOURED ALL OF THE- AFFORDABLE FOR SENIOR KNEW HOUSE AND ABOUT. IN LOS ANGELES AN ON CONVERSATION AROUND SENIORS AT KNOWLEDGE THAT NONE OF BATHROOM FACILITIES WERE SENIOR SENSITIVE. NOT THEM WERE BUILT WITH BARS WITH THE SHOWER PURITY THANKS YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL IF THAT'S ARE GROWING POPULATION AND WE'RE BUILDING FOR THEM THE WE NEED TO BUILD A PROFIT FOR THE WITH THE PLACE THAT THEY REALLY CAN. CONTINUE TO AGING. YOU HAD A- IN A DAY SO WHAT I'M- CAN. ABOUT THE WAY WITH THAT THE FUNDING COME FORWARD TO DO SOME OF THAT WERE. AT RIGHT NOW. IN STATEWIDE DATA IS THE ABILITY TO COLLECT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND SO THE ABILITY TO HAVE THAT AT A STATE LEVEL AND BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND- HOW TO HELP COMMUNITIES LOOK AT THEIR DATA LOOK AT THEIR ASSESSMENT TOOLS SEE IF THERE MIGHT BE SOME RACIAL RACIAL- COMPONENTS TO THE ASSESSMENT TOOL OF SCREENING FOLKS IN OUR OUT BASED ON RACE AND SO SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DOING A REALLY GOOD. JOB ON THAT ALREADY WE'VE BEEN FOR SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THAT I THINK WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT THERE ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES AND LOOKING AT. YOUR HOMELESSNESS SYSTEM AND HOW TO BETTER ADDRESS POTENTIAL DISPARITIES IN IT WHILE NOT LOOKING THAT THEY'RE SORT OF BEFORE HOW. THE CENTER HOUSE. WHO'S COMING IN. IN THIS WE DON'T WANT. TO WAIT THAT PROPORTIONALITY I AND I DON'T US TO FOR BACK ON. OUR INABILITY TO COLLECT RELEVANT DATA BECAUSE OF TWO OH NINE THE- REAR. UP TREATED REALITY IN THE STREETS I DON'T WANT. TO USE THAT COVERS FOR NOT. ON ASKING THE RIGHT REAL ON OF QUESTIONS ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE I MOVE ON. TO DO WOULD BE CARE I HAD A SURE OF JOINING THE GOVERNOR ON MY WITH THE UNVEILING OF TEN OF THE NEW TRAILERS IN SEEN TEN FAMILIES- MOVE FROM THEIR CARS AND MOTELS INTO HOUSING AND THEN I GOT A CALL YESTERDAY ABOUT THE CLOSURE OF A TWENTY ONE BAD BOARD CARE FACILITY IN MY SAME COMMUNITY AND SO THIS WE GIVE WITH ONE HAND WE TAKE WHAT THE OTHER IS- TRAGIC. AND SO MY QUESTION WITH REGARD TO BOARD AND CARE. HERE'S AT THE FEBRUARY- SIT AT A FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTH SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT HEARING ON LICENSE HOMES FROM THE VULNERABLE ADULTS THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TESTIFIED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE EXTENSIVE AGGREGATE DATA ON HOW ALL THE CLOTHES IN THE BOARDING CARE FACILITIES CONTRIBUTES TO HOMELESSNESS. AND SO I'M REALLY CURIOUS BECAUSE IT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT ROLE YOU BELIEVE THESE FACILITIES PLAY IN- SUPPORTING OUR ON HOUSE POPULATION AND HOW WILL THE BOARD AND CAR STABILIZATION COMPONENT OF YOUR PROPOSAL CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AT WHAT WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANTED I- ILLUSTRATE ACTUALLY THE AGENDA NOT HEARING. DID A GOOD JOB OF SPEAKING TO THE CAPACITY CHANGES OVER TIME OF BOTH ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN BOTH CHANGE AND NUMBER OF FACILITIES FACILITY TYPE. AN ACTUAL TOTAL CAPACITY AND SO WHILE AT THE END OF THAT ANALYSIS WE AREN'T NECESSARILY SEEING A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CAPACITY OF THOSE FACILITY TYPES CERTAINLY THE NEED HAS GROWN. AND SO THE OLDER POPULATION IN THE NEED FOR THAT PARTICULAR CARE TYPE HAS GROWN AND ALSO WITHIN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS NOT. THE SAME RESULT THE STATEWIDE AGGREGATE THAT SHOOTS COMMUNITY CERTAINLY- THAT THE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT. THIS PROPOSAL ABSOLUTELY KNOWLEDGES BOARDING CARE AS PART OF THE CONTINUUM TO IT FOR ITS SERVICE AND SO HOW THE AND WOULD THAT WORK IS THAT TO HELP US STABILIZE THESE FACILITIES THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WOULD BE PROPOSING. I THINK PROJECTS PROVIDING OPERATING SUBSIDIES CITIES FACILITY TYPES IN EXCHANGE FOR A HOLD AFFORDABILITY AGREEMENTS. A RENTAL CREDITS DEDICATED RESIDENTIAL CAPACITY FOR THIS POPULATION- THE OTHER PIECE ALL SAY ABOUT IN THIS IS PRIMARILY TARGETING OBVIOUSLY THOSE FACILITIES SERVING THE SS I SS P. POPULATION. AND AGAIN AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT'S THE PIECE WHERE OUR DATA ISN'T AS PRECISE AS WE'D LIKE IT TO BE SO WE- ESSENTIALLY TAKE- THE CAPACITY INFORMATION WE HAVE OF THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN AND- RESIDENTIAL CARE FOR SO. FACILITY ARE SEE IF HE'S AN ARTIST I'M GONNA JUST GO WITHOUT IT WE KNOW IT THE ACRONYMS ARE- IN AND WE DO A DATA MATCH WITH THAT AS A SIDE DATA SO IT'S NOT IT'S IN PERFECT. THAT IF ACTUAL. THIS IS THE- ARE AT THE RESIDENTS WITHIN THE HOUSEHOLD ARE ALSO RECEIVING SSI IT MAY NOT REFLECT. ESSENTIALLY OVER A REPRESENTING OUR WHO WHICH OF THESE WHICH- ARE BEING PROVIDE CARE NEEDS FACILITY TYPES THAT'S THE IMPRECISION WE HAVE IN OUR DAY CERTAINLY. DISCONTENT WE GET A PLACE WHERE WE NEED STABILIZE IN AND SUPPORT AND CERTAINLY THE NEED FOR- FOR CARE IN THIS FACILITY TYPE IS GROWING OVER TIME AS BOTH OUR OUR POPULATION AGES AND LIVES LONGER ALONG THE WAY SO. I WE DID COMMIT ADD TO THE COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION KIND OF LOOKING AT THAT DEMOGRAPHIC POPULATION GROWTH LOOKING A SOME SPECIFIC COUNTY DIFFERENCES IN THE CAPACITY AND WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH THAT INFORMATION I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I. DO WANT TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND MAYBE IT'S JUST MY HOME COUNTY- BECAUSE- WE ARE FEELING THE CRUNCH OF THE- THE NUMBER THAT I HAVE HEARD REPEATED- IS AS A THOUSAND. LOST FACILITIES NINE BED WITHOUT LOSS FACILITIES OVER THE LAST YEAR TO AND SO I LOOK TO GET THE INFORMATION FOR YOUR TERMS. GAP THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ALSO WANT TO RESPOND BEFORE OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES MISSED PICKLE. I WOULD ONLY JUST ADD VERY BRIEFLY THAT IN LA COUNTY WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY PULL BILLION CORNERS AND LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES HAVE BEEN PILOTING- A STRATEGY TO. KEEP BOARDING CARES FROM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS AND PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL INCOME STREAM AND ALSO- ENHANCE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES THAT IN THAT CASE BRING CORNERS IS PROVIDING SO SOME OF THE ELEMENTS THAT I THINK ARE EMERGING IN THE STATE VISION ARE I THINK WORKING AT A PILOT. WHEN I COUNTY RIGHT NOW. EXCELLENT BUT YES. THANK YOU I JUST ALSO WANTED TO ADD YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THE SENIOR POPULATION THAT IS GROWING AND THEREFORE REQUIRING MORE BOARDING CARE FACILITIES. WERE SEEN ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE OF THINGS THAT BOARDING CARES ARE REALLY GOOD SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF OUR FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING. A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES SO IN ORDER FOR US TO STEP FOLKS DOWN FOR INSTANCE OUT OF PSYCHIATRIC BEDS WE OFTEN NEED BORDEN CARES AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE STAY. MAYBE IN JAIL OR STAY IN THE HOSPITAL LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY BECAUSE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. THOSE RESOURCES IN OUR COMMUNITY SO I WANTED TO ADD THAT AS WELL. EXCELLENT GOOD OPEN UP I'VE GOT A LIST SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY PAN AND SKINNER WHY CATTLE SKI. SENATOR L. ARGUE. STE ON I HOPE SOMEBODY WILL WILL ASK YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE GOOD THE HEAT AND HELP FUNDING DID AS WE TRY. TO SHOULD NOW. TO THIS ONE TIME SEVENTEEN FIFTY MILLION THIS IS MY SENSE THAT. THAT THIS BUDGET THAT INCLUDES I'M GOING FUNDING. TO HELP PEOPLE ASK. TO MOVING ON. TO BE DIM. SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MANAGER IN A- GOT A JOB I'VE TO LEAVE SHORTLY A TIME LITTLE WHO WERE COME. IS A DOWNSTAIRS AND I'M GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE VOTING PORTION I DON'T HAVE TO BE FOR THE REST OF. THE GOVERNOR BUSH I AND EIGHT EIGHT BIT BILLS ON THE PAST WHAT I'M NOT SURE IS IT GOING TO DISCONTINUE SOME OF WHAT'S ALREADY IN PROCESS. AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED BECAUSE HE'S TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT WE HAD GOOD GOT TO MONITOR WHAT WE'RE DOING. TO SEE WHETHER IT IS WORKING OR NOT. THE IT MAY I'M JUST MAKING UP THAT MADE SOME COULD OBSERVE AS TO THIS HOW WE DO THEN ACHIEVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND WHERE IS INVESTED- SOMETHING'S WE MIGHT NOT. DO BEFORE WHAT YOU CAN'T DO IT JUST. BUILD ON SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T WORK BUT KEEP IT FUNDED AND MOVE ON. AB TO GIVE GIVE THAT SOME CONSIDERATION. AND THE REGIONAL MODEL. LET ME FOR THAT SPECIFIC WE ASK YOU TO RESPOND NOW THE OTHER ONE JUST MAYBE THINK ABOUT AND THEN GET THING INTO MY OFFICE FROM YOUR OPINIONS ABOUT THAT THE REGIONAL MODEL HOW WILL THAT FUNCTION WHO IS THE AUTHORITY THAT WILL THE COORDINATE IF YOU WILL THE REGIONAL MODEL I SEE MERIT IN IT BUT THERE'S ALSO INCREDIBLE PAROCHIALISM THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH. HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE THAT MAYBE THE- OWNER THE- COULD COMMENT. SO THE REGIONAL MODEL AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND NON PROFITS COULD APPLY TO BE THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR IN ANY GIVEN REGION- THE SPECIFICS OF THE REGION WE ARE STILL IN CONVERSATION WITH YOU ALL ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFICS OF THAT IS TO COME IN CONTINUED CONVERSATION. YOUR POINT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN METRICS- IS HEARD AN AD IN ADDITION- IN THE TRAILER BILL AS IT EXISTS TODAY WE ARE PROPOSING TO USE PERFORMANCE BASED CONTRACTS- THAT REALLY WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO DO- LOOK AT THE RESULTS THAT WERE CHEATING IDENTIFY THOSE OUTCOMES AND FRIENDS- AND BE ABLE TO FOR NOT SEEING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT TO REDIRECT FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE OUT WORKING WITH. FOLKS YOU CAN ALSO GET BANDS THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF- IDENTIFYING AND REFINING THAT DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION PLAN IS THAT PROPOSED TO BE AND BE INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR REQUEST FOR APPLICATION PROCESS SO THAT'S BEEN OFFERED BUT NATION WITH OUR OUR PART. IT'S TO ENCOUNTER WHO IS YET TO DO MORE APPLY MET. ALL OF THESE AND- IN TERMS OF LOOKING OUT COMES. THE IT ALSO WAS A OF ISSUE THIS TO THE ONE FROM MARIPOSA QUE A VERY SMALL COUNTY. AS WE ARE PORTION DOLLARS IT'LL BE FLOWING- HOW WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THESE SMALLER COUNTIES. GET A FAIR SHARE OR- A PLACE AT THE TABLE. ED AND THAT'S ANOTHER POINT APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT TYPICALLY AS WE'RE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF FUNDING METHODOLOGIES ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS WERE LOOKING AT NEED AND CAPACITY IN A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES AND SO. I KNOW SHOULD ON CAN CAN ADD APPRECIATE THIS- AS WELL THAT WE SOMETIMES DO A BASS LINE. AT ALLOCATION FOR SOME OF OUR A SMALLER COUNTIES IN IN REGIONS AND SO WE WOULD WANT IT CAN ABSOLUTELY ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION WHAT THAT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE TO FULLY BE AVAILABLE TO RESOURCE THE NEED AND GIVEN COMMUNITY. AT THE WILL OF THE THIS PUSH ONE MORE THAN OUT RUN I MAY HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS BACK. THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS MADE OBD. AT LEAST IN THE- PLAN AS PRESENTED TO ME. THE THERE WOULD BE- THAT AN AGGRESSIVE OF. ALL I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S A SANCTION. TO COUNTIES THAT DON'T MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE. NOW THAT CONCERNS ME A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE THE STATE IS IN NO SMALL MEASURE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HOMELESS PROBLEM. THEN I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THAT BUT IT'S- OBLIGATED BUT IT RELATES TO REALIGN. AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY NEW IT'S XCELERATED BUT THAT SAID- I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT WE DON'T AYE AYE WHAT IS AT COMMUNITIES THING LOOK LIKE IS IT INDUSTRY DETERMINE WHAT THAT WILL BE A FREE OF THE STATE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THE LOCAL. GOING HOW THEY WILL BE A SANCTION BY SAY. SO WITH SPECIFIC TO THE FUNDS IT IS THIS PERFORMANCE SPACE CONTRACTING MECHANISM THAT I JUST REFERENCE TO ADD THAT WILL BE USED TO LOOK TO SEE- WHAT WHERE AT REGIONS ARE HAVING SUCCESS AND WHERE THEY NEED SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT THAT WILL PROVIDE. BROADER THAN THAT I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE CONTINUED CONVERSATION. ALL RIGHT I THINK YOU'VE BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE AND I WILL BE BACK VERY SHORTLY THANK YOU MANAGER YOU'RE VERY WELCOME. THANK YOU I AM I THINK THIS OUR NEW MODEL OF HAVING ALL THE PANELS PRISON FIRST. IS HELPFUL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HEAR ALL THE WITNESSES BEFORE PEOPLE HAVE TO COME AND GO- SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THAT- HALL. THE AGENCY IF WHO HAVE FALL PRESENTED NO WILL BE DELVING AND MORE DEEPLY IN OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS- ALSO AND MAKE NOTE THAT- I WAS PLEASED TO. BE AS A MEMBER OF THE- HUMAN SERVICES TO HEAR ABOUT THE BOARD CARE HOMES AND THEN JUST YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WE HAD A WHOLE HEARING ON. CAL'S MANAGED CARE CONTRACTS AND CAL A APPRECIATE THE- AGAIN DTS IS A PARTICIPATION THAT- I DEFINITELY WANT TO IT WOULD BE. LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS TO HOUSE STAINED THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SO I GOT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR SAID IT AND- AT THE AT THE- BUT DIDN'T SPECIFY HOW HE'S GONNA ACCOMPLISH THAT SO I AM VERY MUCH. WELL I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PROPOSALS FROM THE GOVERNOR AND WE ALWAYS LOOK TO THE GOVERNOR FOR LEADERSHIP- I GUESS THE QUESTION I DO HAVE- SO REGARDING THE SEVEN OR FIFTY MILLION THAT'S GOING TO DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES- V. DOES I THINK MAKES SENSE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RATIONALE IS JUST TIE IT TO OUR EXISTING SAFETY NET PROGRAM TO A LEVERAGE THAT SO WHEN WE ALSO NEED TO AND THEN STAYING AWAY BUT- IN TERMS OF THE- HE SPEAK TO I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THE TRAILER LANGUAGE. COMING TO US CAN YOU SPEAK TO HOW THE GOVERNOR FIFTY MILLION IS. THAT GONNA BE UNDER DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THAT AND THE EXISTING SAFETY NET. STRUCTURE AND SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDING AND THEN ALSO PERHAPS ALSO WITH SOME OF THE OTHER- SAFETY NET PROGRAMS WE HAVE AS WELL LIKE MEDI CAL SO. I DON'T THINK IT WAS SPECIFIED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SO WHAT WE WOULD BE ARE PROPOSING IS PART OF THE REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS TO REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AS THEY WOULD IDENTIFY. HOW THE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONNECTING TO THE BROADER SOCIAL SERVICE ARRAYED INTEGRATION. SO HE ARE YOU REQUIRING THAT IS PART OF THE RESPONSE OKAY AND WHAT WHAT AND I ROUTE YOU KNOW I THINK TO SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS GOING TO REGINALD IN TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP WITH. YOU HAVE COUNTIES WHO HAVE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS WHO DOES AND SO FORTH WHAT'S THE- FI CONNECTION THERE'D THAT YOU'RE EXPECTING- BECAUSE THEY WANT TO ACCEPT LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO THE OTHER SERVICES CAN SAY CAN YOU SPEAK TO. YOU CAN HAVE YOU DISTRIBUTE FINEST TO BE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY ARE LUPTON. YES I ABSOLUTELY YES WOULD BE BOTH ON GUIDANCE TO REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND GUIDANCE TO COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AROUND HOW THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD CONNECT WE'D BE. PROVIDING THAT AS THE- IMPLEMENTATION- OPERAS OPERATE OPERATING OCCURS WITHIN THAT THE PROGRAM. THAT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING THAT THERE'S A NEW ENTITY DOING ELIGIBILITY IN ROME AND IT'S ABOUT THE CONNECTION AND MAKING SURE- THOSE THOSE. PROCESSES ARE IN PLACE BEAR STAB LISTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE OUT REACH OCCURRING. THAT THERE'S THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT AND THAT'S GOING TO LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE STATE BASED ON AT NEW RESOURCE THE BILL STATING AND- AND CAPACITY BUT CERTAINLY THE DESCRIPTION AB HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP AND PROCESS WILL WORK IS AN EXPECTATION TO BE RESPONDED TO IN THAT. OUR FAITH OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER HE SAID SO ASK THAT IS THAT NO WAY OUT. TALK ABOUT TRYING TO DRESS HOMELESSNESS IN TERMS OF. PREVENTION TO- SO- AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETIMES IT'S NOT REALLY A MESS I THINK THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING. WHERE PEOPLE SAY WELL YEAH I THOUGHT POINT TO THE FOR MEDI SERVICES FOR PEOPLE HOMELESS CERTAINLY THEM BUT- NOT. HEALTH ISSUES THAT LED TO SOMEONE HOMELESS. BECAME THAT LEAD TO OR EXACERBATE AN EXIT. HEALTH YOURSELF COURSE OUR PLAY CATCH UP ONCE ARE HOMELESS SO. GITA ABOUT HOW OLD THE FUNDS SENATOR FIFTY MILLION IS SO TARGETED TOWARD ART THE OTHER FUNDS AS WELL TO PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM. GETTING UNDER THAT SOME OF ITS THREE. TRAPS FOR UP ASSIST. WE CAN PEOPLE. HOMELESS SO THANK UP. I THINK THERE'S A MAIN PIECES AND IN THAT THINK WILL HAVE AND UPPER HELPING US BE MORE WE ENTER GEN I'M SO FOR THE IN HIS CAR MANAGEMENT IT DOESN'T PEOPLE OUT RISK OF TO AB- EARLY INTERVENTION AS WELL AS HOMELESS ON THE OTHER PIECES BUT- IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ENTRY POINTS OF SOMEONE IS BEEN NCARCERATED- RECENTLY THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE SERVICES ALREADY THERE WORKING UP FRONT YEAH AND I GOT THAT SO I GUESS WHEN THE THINGS I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE I'M LOOKING. LEVEL GET SOCIAL SPACES THAT MANY OF YOU TALK ABOUT CALLING HIM AND SAID WHICH BY THE WAY WE HAD THE HEARING YESTERDAY IT'S TARGETED TOWARD A YOU KNOW IT WAS. INTENSIVE TO SET PEOPLE TO TAKE SOME EMPLOYMENT WE TALKED ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY- WE HAVE THE SEVEN CITY AND WE HAVE FUNDING FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PIECE AND THEN WE HAVE THE SEVEN FIFTY MILLION ON THE SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE SO IS THERE ANY OF THE SITE I MAKE FUNDING IS SO BE IT HOW THE TWO CAN AND ALSO. AS A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ALSO HELPING FOR PREVENTION OR IS IT ONLY ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE TO SIDE THAT. WE'RE LOOKING AT. THE THESE. IN ON THE AT I THINK THAT THE THING IS SINCE WE CAN PAY FOR THE RABBI SIR WE CAN PAY FOR ALL THE NAPA THE EIGHT ON SIR CAN'T PAY FOR THE AND SO RIGHT THE WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER CARE PLANS TO ME NEED REGIONAL I'M A GET TO BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ENTITIES AS WELL AS ANY OF THEIR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY HAVE- CONTRACTED WITH FOR THE VARIOUS HOUSING BUNDLES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WE'LL HAVE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY TO IDENTIFY EARLY INTERVENTION PREVENTION AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY HOMELESS. SO WE WERE KIND OF THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND THEN WE CAN'T PAY FOR THE LONG TERM RENTAL ON SUBSIDIES AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD BE WORKING CLOSELY HOUSING FUND FOR THOSE CAN THOSE COMPONENTS OKAY MAYBE JUST TO ADD TO THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY WAS THAT IT UP TO EXPECTATIONS HEALTH. THOSE CONNECTIONS. TO MAKE IN THE JUSTICE SERVICES MAKING THE CAN. THE BRILLIANT. TO THE END. PROVIDE THE SERVE AND THE COUNTY SO THAT. THAT EXPECTATION OF THAT CONNECTION ACROSS BECAUSE JC SAID THERE'S THE ASSESSMENT. BUILDING TO DO THE NAVIGATION BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO YOU KNOW WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ONGOING BUT I THINK ONE OF THINGS AND ONE DELVIN I'M NOT GONNA TAKE UP MORE TIME HERE- AND SUBCOMMITTEE. IS THAT I APPRECIATE SO I'M HEARING A LOT ABOUT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WE AND WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION YESTERDAY BUT I'M ALSO THIS IS SOME EXAMPLE WHAT ABOUT THE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS AT THE COUNTY WHO ALSO HAVE THE ACCESS THE OTHER SERVICES. IS IT GOING TO BE THROUGH THE MANAGED CARE PLAN OUR CONTRACTS ARE OF HOW WHERE DO THE WHAT WOULD YOU THE COUNTY EDS WHO WHO ALSO HAVE THE- FENCE THE UP. SERVICES AS WELL SO THIS WHOLE CONNECTION BETWEEN EXISTING SAY NET. AND CAN ONLY EXCESS SERVICES AND THESE OF MONEY I THEY NEED TO BE CLARIFIED AND WHAT THE DIFFERENT ROLES AND WHO CAN ACCESS BECAUSE I'M AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE. EITHER FALLING IN THE GAPS OF THERE'S NOT CLEARLY IN THAT- YOU YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING WITH FOLKS WHO ARE RISK OF HOMELESSNESS WHO ARE. CURRENTLY RECEIVING SOCIAL SERVICES MAY BE MORE FAMILIAR TO SOCIAL WORKERS OR WORKING AT THE COUNTY THAN THEY ARE TO THE- SO. THAT OUGHT TO THINK NEEDS TO GET SORT OUT AND THEN ALSO TIMING WISE BECAUSE AGAIN WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO ROLL OUT THE CAL AIM AND DO YOU KNOW FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT REASONS WHY AND I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO AS FAST AS HE CAN TO. FOR EXACTLY OF WHAT THE WAIVERS AND SO FORTH AT WHAT POINT DO WE GET TO THOSE. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET SOME THE SERVICES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE'RE FOR CONFRONTING AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS HOMELESSNESS ISSUE RIGHT NOW WITH NOT ONLY PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY HOMELESS BUT PEOPLE ENTERING HOMELESSNESS SO. SO EVEN AS WE'RE TRYING TO THAT REVAMPS MEDI CAL AND DO CAL AIM AND DO THAT THE IT HAS SERVICES. WILL STILL A LITTLE BIT IN THE FUTURE AT THAT'S GONNA TAKE FOR THAT HAPPENED AND THEN ALSO HAPPY AND THIS CONNECTION WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL- I THINK NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. SO I WOULD JUST ADD THOUGH THAT THE HOT FUNDING THAT APPLICATIONS REGISTERED AND WE CAN HAVE A ONE OF THE ELIGIBLE USES FOR THAT IS PREVENTION SHELTER DIVERSION SO WE'LL SEE HOW MANY COMMUNITIES CHOOSE TO TAKE AND USE THE FUNDING THAT WAY. BUT IN THE INTERIM WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE'S THE PREVENTION FUNDING THAT CAN BE COMING THROUGH THAT. THAT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FROM LAST YEAR AS WELL. OKAY APPRECIATE I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF WE HAVE A LOT OF THE SKY WE HAVE A LOT OF DISCUSSION. COMING UP THANK YOU. THAT WE DO THANK YOU SIR TO SKINNER. THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ORGANIZING THIS HEARINGS. PORTANTINO SORRY LISTEN TO ALL OF THE- PANELISTS SO JUST THOUGHT OF THE TSUNAMI OF ACTIONS THAT HAVE LED US TO THIS PLACE YEAH I MEAN WE CLEARLY THE FACT WE'VE NOT BUILT ENOUGH HOUSING OVER SO MANY DECADES LED TO THE SCARCITY WHICH ROSE THE COSTS BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE. THE FACT THAT WE ARE MASS INCARCERATION SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS NUMBERS OF DISPROPORTIONATE IN FIVE IMPACT ON OUR BLACK POPULATION OR BLACK CALIFORNIANS. THEY HAVE RECORDS AND THOSE RECORDS THEN PREVENTED THEM FOR HAVING THE TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT THAT WOULD GIVE THEM THE TYPE OF- INCOME TO REALLY AFFORD THE HOUSING COSTS WE HAVE. ALSO THE KICK IT ACCESS TO A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER DEPENDING IF WHAT KIND OF RECORD THEY HALF. AN A SO ALL THOSE FACTORS- MEANWHILE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INCREASE IN SENIORS SO WE GO BACK TO THE RECESSION. THE RECESSION IMPACTED EVERYTHING MEAN THE RECESSIONS WHEN WE FIRST STARTED SEEN THE- RIGHT AFTER THE RECESSION WHICH WOULD COUPLE OF THINGS BUT THE BORDEN CARE HOMES IN S. AROSE JUST BEING WIPED OUT. SO THAT TYPE OF HOUSING THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AND THEN WE HAD LOTS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING DISPROPORTIONATELY ARE BLACK RESIDENTS LOST HOMES WHICH WAS THEIR NEST EGG. AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THAT MANY OF THEM OLDER FOR LOS RETIREMENT FUNDS SO. YOU YOU THAT'S WHAT WE SEE SOME MORE OF OUR AGING POPULATION. IN BUT HOW WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD A- TO BE ABLE TO THEM THROUGH THIS. THIS TYPE OF- PRESSURES RIGHT AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT SENATOR SKINNER THE WORK- UNFORTUNATE THIS LEGISLATURE DID IN TERMS OF REDUCING OUR CAL WORKS GRANTS YES SO THEY WERE IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS THAT GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY YEAH AND SO IT IT'S LIKE THIS TO TSUNAMI OF IMPACTS AND THEN MEANWHILE WE HAVE THIS ECONOMIC BOOM. AND THE- BOOM. HAS CREATED A GIVE THE SCARCITY UP. COSTS OF HOUSING BUT A CERTAIN PERCENT OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SO IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT THEN WHOEVER OWNS THAT YOU KNOW EITHER IF YOUR LANDLORD OR THE GUY SELLING YOU'RE GOING TO SELL TO THAT. THAT PERSON WHO CAN AFFORD IT WHICH THERE IS A PERCENT OF PEOPLE CALIFORNIA YOU CAN. BUT THEN OUR WAGE GROWTH IT'S NOT BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR COMMENSURATE FOR MOST PEOPLE SO THEY THEN CAN'T. AND NOW. WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CRISIS NOW AND WE'RE DEALING WITH HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS IMMEDIATE. THIS VERY. JUST SOUL WRENCHING HEART BREAKING. EVERY TIME WE GO HOME EVERY TIME WERE EVEN IN THE CAPITAL SEEN PEOPLE IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITH THIS LEVEL OF PEOPLE BEING ON OUR STREETS IN A MYSTERY AND IT'S JUST AWFUL. BUT IT. WOULD CLEARLY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE IMMEDIATE BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS OTHER STUFF OR IT'S NEVER GOING TO GO AWAY. WE GOT EVEN REMOVE THE OBSTACLES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOSE RECORDS FROM BEING ABLE TO GET INTO HOUSING- GOOD GOOD JOBS. AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH JUST THERE'S A LOT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH YES SPAWNING HAS TO BE AREN'T GOING. TO DO WITH THIS IMMEDIATE BUT WE BETTER FIX THESE OTHER STRUCTURAL THINGS HOME YOU KNOW THE TROUBLE SO NOW POLICIES FOR MY EDITORIAL BUT JUST OBSESSED CONSUMED WITH THIS FOR A LONG TIME NOW MY QUESTIONS. SO THE FIRST ONE. THE LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION FOR ALL THE REASONS WE TALKED ABOUT AND WE'VE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE FEDERAL WHAT WE NORMALLY USE SECTION IT'S NOT ADEQUATE SO. ARE THERE. TWO OUR TO HEAR ABOUT OBSTACLES THAT ARE KEEPING US FROM USING THOSE MY UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE FROM SOME PROVIDERS IS THAT ARE THAT CERTAIN OF OUR MONEY WAS TIED TO THE HIGH DEFINITION. OF LIKE IMMINENTLY HOMELESS AND THAT DOUBTS YOU HAVE TO BE HOMELESS WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS AND THERE'S A SET OF VERY LARGE SET OF PEOPLE THAT NEED. THIS TYPE OF HOUSING SUBSIDY WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE HOMELESS IN FOURTEEN DAYS. BUT MAYBE THEY WILL BE IN THREE MONTHS OR WHATEVER SO IS THAT IT OBSTACLE DO WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND WHAT. OBSTACLES ARE WE EXPERIENCING IN TERMS OF TWO TO PROVIDE AT PREVENT GEN I. THAT FIND. TO MY FIRST QUESTION. REGARDING THE OBSTACLES AROUND THE FEDERAL RESOURCES THE PRIMARY THING THAT WE SEE IN LA COUNTY IN UTILIZING OUR RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO JUST MAKING SURE RECORD DATING IN THE RIGHT WAY IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE REIMBURSEMENT OCCURS RELATIVE TO THE COST OF LIVING- SO THE VOUCHER PAYS IS NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE AVERAGE COST OF LIVING IN LA OR THE COST OF THE UNIT OR RENT IN LA SO JUST IS NOT COMPETITIVE. IN THE RENTAL MARKET. THE FEDERAL YOU KNOW LIMITATION ANSWER WE IS OUR FINING TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THAT. ADDING TO OKAY SO THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO BUT YEAH I THINK THAT'S- CERTAINLY BARRIER- I THINK THAT DOUBLES LHASA AND- LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES IN BERLIN CORNERS THE OTHER PARTNERS ARE DOING SOME VERY INTENSIVE SORT OF PILOTING AND PROBLEM SOLVING AROUND- UTILIZING- TENANT BASED VOUCHERS- INCLUDING. AS A SITE BASED MODEL BUT COUNTY BACKSTOPS- WHERE THOSE CAN BE STRUCTURED AS IF IT WAS A PROJECT BASED AND THEN YOU KNOW CREATE ACCESS TO THOSE UNITS- I WILL SAY BROADLY AND NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO THIS. THAT PUTS TAKE OUT BY OF INFLEXIBILITY. PLATE IN ADDITION TO THE TALENT- THAT THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY STRUCTURE HAS KEEPING ACE THAT. COST IT'S AN. ANGEL MICHAEL CALIFORNIA BUT OTHER PARTS OF CAL AS WELL I WILL SAY THERE'S ALL KINDS OF INFO. IS I MEAN WE WORK WITH HOUSING AUTHORITIES UP IN LOS ANGELES CA AND OVER THE STATE AND IN SAN FRANCISCO AND- JUST TO GET IT. TO PASS INSPECTION YOU'VE GOT SOMEBODY WHO'S WAITING TO MOVE IN WHO IS IN A SHELTER ON THE STREETS. AND THE UNIT MIGHT NOT PASS INSPECTION FOR A REASON THAT. I MEAN. UP UP LIGHTS WHICH IS IN A- HIGHER TO LOS OF THEIR JUST FOR. LEGACY PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNFORTUNATELY VERY INFLEXIBLE. SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IS TO TRY TO PROVIDE. AROUND SERVICES LANDLORD ENGAGEMENT. ENABLING COME LIKE BRIAN CORNERS TO BE THE FACE OF THE PROGRAM WHERE. WHERE LANDLORDS MIGHT OTHERWISE SEE A STIGMA ATTACHED TO WORKING WITH HOUSING AUTHORITIES OF THAT- THAT BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN LIMITS YOU CAN'T DO CERTAIN THINGS IN TERMS OF PRIDE. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE YOU WERE VIOLATE THE FEDERAL RULES. IS THE STATE IS OUR STATE FUNDING TIED TO THAT HIGH DEFINITION BEING AN OBSTACLE AT ALL FOR THIS- RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROVISION. I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S MORE WE'RE HEARING THE TABLE AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE FUNDS IS ALLOWING US TO STOP GAP SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE DOING AN INSPECTION AND THAT THAT THE THERE'S A BROKEN WINDOW OR SOMETHING IS WRONG OUR FUNDING IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FIX THAT. AND GET SOMEBODY INTO USE SO I WOULD SAY THAT. IT WORKING AROUND HAD DEFINITIONS AND HIDE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND HAD RESTRICTIONS. WITH ARE FINDING LOCALLY- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT A SORT OF OUR OUR FUNDING DEFINITION RIGHT NOW IS. FOR OUR OUR OWN DEFINITION OF HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW IS THAT IS THAT. EVEN IN THE TOP TEN OF THE OF THE ISSUES WERE WERE SAYING. AND IF I COULD ADD FROM ABOUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING VOUCHERS ARE AVAILABLE. HOUSING AUTHORITIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOVERNED BY CITIES AND COUNTIES MANY TIMES THERE AND- BODIES. ALSO YOU HAVE A LARGE. WELL BEING LIST ON THE HOUSING AUTHORITY IS THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY OPEN UP THEIR WAITING LIST- EVERY YEAR FOR INSTANCE FOR SAM BERNIE DINOS- THEY IT WAS SEVEN YEARS. THEY DRESS RECENTLY OPENED AT PRIOR WAS SEVEN YEARS THEIR FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE WAITING LIST THE WAY HAD ALSO MANAGES THEIR PLANS. IS YOU HAVE TO PICK PEOPLE FROM THE WAITING LIST SO IF YOU'RE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE NOT ON THE WAITING LIST AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TENANTS BASED ALTERS. IT SOME MORE THE OTHER. WHEN RELATIONSHIPS. RELY PART OUT. SO AM I THANK THIS TALK ABOUT PROJECT SPONSORED. MISSION IS SHE- OUR- WHAT. TO ALLOW PUT THAT PRICE FOR THE NEW UNITS IN A EITHER TO PER OR POTENTIALLY PER AND I THINK THE OTHER ISSUE IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO HELP OUR TROOPS COULD BE DEPLOYED IT'S HAS DEFINITION OF A UNIT ROOM EIGHT AN AT AND ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT WAS THE LOWERING OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS SOME THAT BECAUSE POLICIES SET UP. USING FAT RESOURCES OTHERS FROM HATS PERSPECTIVE A UNIT PASSED TO HAVE TO USE A VOUCHER HAS TO HAVE A BATHROOM AND A KITCHEN. YEAH WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AND MANY AGENCIES- ARE LOOKING OUT MY CAR COUNTY ARE THERE OTHER HOUSING TYPOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE. TO BRING OUR CONSTRUCTION COSTS DOWN BECAUSE THAT'S ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND THE OTHER FLIPSIDE IS HOW TO WILL LINE THE RENTAL RESOURCE THAT'S OUT THERE AND WHERE THEY'RE DISCONNECTS BETWEEN FINANCING AND BETWEEN REGULATIONS IN BETWEEN POLICIES AN APPLICATION. SO JUST TO KIND OF BE AWARE FROM WHAT WAS DESCRIBED BY EVERYBODY RELATIVE VALUE IN MARKET THERE'S PROCESSES AND ULTIMATELY THE INITIATIVE DEPLOYMENT OF THE POUCH. IN IF I COULD ADD ONE MORE COMMENT ON A POSITIVE NOTE WHICH IS THAT- AS DIFFICULT MEAN USING A LOCAL FLEXIBLE SUBSIDY IS SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND EASIER TO WORK WITH DâN A FEDERAL SUBSIDY HAVING SAID THAT IF THERE IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE IF THERE IS CAPACITY BILL FOR LANDLORD ENGAGEMENT RENT SUBSIDY AND PENDENCY SUPPORTS. AS HAS BEEN BUILT UP IN CORNERS AND SOME OTHER AGENCIES AROUND THE STATE THEN WITHIN THAT IT IS POSSIBLE YOU HAVE DEDICATED TEAMS THAT BRIEF PROBLEM SOMETHING AROUND HOW TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUBSIDIES HOW TO ENGAGE LANDLORDS DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITY SO BY INVESTING IN MAC A CITY WITH A CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HAVE FUN WITH RENT SUBSIDIES EMBEDDED IN IT YOU WILL OVER TIME I THINK IN A BILL AT A STATE UTILIZED. ABLE FEDERAL REESE INCLUDING SITE EIGHT DOCTORS. SERVE COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS ON OBSTACLES ON THE OTHER ONE IS SO WE SEE THIS AS A LOT OF WARDEN CORONAS ARE LEAST ENTITIES NOT THEY DON'T OWN AND SO THEN OF COURSE IF THE OWNER DECIDES TO CONVERT. BUT WE'VE ON. THE REAL QUESTION IS THERE ARE THERE ARE POTENTIAL UNITS AVAILABLE WHETHER IT'S VACANT HOMES OR BOARD AND CARE OR MOTELS ARE VERY STE THINGS BUT THEY WOULD NEED TO BE PURCHASED FOR US TO. TO UTILIZE IMPROPERLY ARE THERE OBSTACLES IN TERMS OF OUR STATE FUNDING FOR THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE THAT POTENTIALLY EASIER. BECAUSE THAT SECURES IT COULD SECURE PROPERTIES THEN FOR LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BUILD FROM SCRATCH WHICH IS QUITE EXPENSIVE. IF THERE ARE ANY THAT'S GREAT BUT- I HEAR FROM PROVIDERS THAT THERE ARE SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. SO I'LL SAY ON THIS ONE I MAY HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH SOME DETAIL DEFINITELY ONE OF THE THREE GOALS OF THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING FUND THAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE OF THESE HOUSING UNITS FOR MOVING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND OUT OF HOMELESSNESS. WHETHER THAT INVOLVES TO ADULT RIGHT PURCHASE- EXCEPT FOR USE OF THE FUND WE HAVE TO CHECK USUALLY WE DO IT THROUGH OTHER YOU KNOW MANDATES AND OTHER INCENTIVES- BUT- WE'LL CHECK AND GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE ON THAT. WE DIFFERENT BE IN ON IT YOUR HOME IS MONIES HAVE A FIND FOR REENTRY HOUSES. AND AT WEAK CHARACTER TO WHERE THERE WERE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD ACCESS TO PURCHASE PROPERTY BUT THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO YOU FUNDING FOR THE PURPOSE SO ANYWAY THE- WHAT PURSUE IT. COUPLE REQUEST. ANOTHER ONE IT. OUR YOU GRADING ARE. Q. H. C. NEVER TALK ABOUT THAT'S VERY COMMONLY THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER FOR THEM AND I KNOW AT LEAST MYERS AND I'M THOSE CLAY HAVE REALLY SOCIAL YOU KNOW MY OFFICE SENT SOMEONE WHO IS IN NEED OF HELP TO A CLINIC IN THAT MAKE THEM SOME UP TO THE CAL GOT SIGNED UP FOR CALIBRATION. KINDA THING. AND I'M WONDERING IF IN THIS WHEN WE LOOK ABOUT THIS- KIND OF COORDINATED CARE ARE WE UTILIZING. THEM AS A RESOURCE ARE THE INTEGRATED IN THIS SO FQHCS WOULD BE AN ELIGIBLE PROVIDER TO BE AN ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT PROVIDER WHO COULD CONTINUE TO BE THAT KIND OF LEAD SOURCE ENTITY. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING ALL OF THE VARIOUS PIECES ACROSS- VERY SOCIAL SERVICES WHETHER IT'S THE AND LIEU OF HOUSING SERVICES TO CONNECT THEM TO THE EFFORT TO DO THAT- OR IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY WOULD BE A CANDIDATE FOR THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT AND WORKS WITH THE HELP HOME MODEL. WE WERE AT THAT. ENDING ON THAT IS AND WE'VE COMMUNICATED THAT MEANS THEY'RE SMART BUT ALL. WE'RE MAKING WE HAVE COMMUNICATED THAT BOOK. INTO THE IT THAT. ALSO GIVE THEM CLARIFICATION REGARDS TO HOW THEY WERE PAID. ON THE HELP COMES NOT A WOULD BE CONSISTENT IT WOULD BE ABOVE- IN SEPARATE THEN THE PPS RATE ON THE MUNICH BUT WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING IS. THE RIGHT OF. CENTER. THIS IS THE WORD YOUR CREDIT PART OF THE HEALTH. PROGRAM WHICH VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ENHANCED MANAGEMENT SO THEY SITE. WHERE THERE ARE SO. SPECIFIC SAYS INTO THE FOR THEIR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH NEEDS GREAT. GREAT AND JUST MY ONE OBSERVATION HAVING WORKED FOR CITIES AND THEN COMING TO THE COUNTY AND STARTING TO LISTEN TO LINGO ASSOCIATED WITH. ALL THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. IT WHEN CONNECTING DIFFERENT SERVICES A LOT OF TIMES SMALLER MEDIUM CITIES. DON'T KNOW RESOURCE THERE. AS WE AS THE STATE HAS STARTED ON THE PROCESS. WE WITH I THINK KEEP AND HOPS ON THE REGIONAL THE REGIONAL PLANTS IT IT STARTS PULLING THE CITY'S MORE INTO THE TABLE PARTICULIER SMALLER CITIES ARE LARGER CITIES THEY HAVE MORE CONNECTIVITY TO YOUR COUNTIES MOST OF THE MAJORITY OF YOUR CITIES REALLY DON'T KNOW THESE TERMINOLOGIES AND WHAT'S THERE AND AT THAT SERVICES PROVIDED. I THINK SOME OF THE POSITIVE ABOUT THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT BUT DON'T ASSUME ALL OF THOSE STOCKS CONNECTED TODAY AND THERE'S GREATER OPPORTUNITY SUCH AS- AS THE NEXT DAY EVEN NOW THEY STOOD BEFORE YEARS AGO QUITE BRIGHT. SOUND JULY QUESTIONS ANOTHER ONE IS THAT WE'VE SEEING CITIES NOW I THINK SENATORS GOES DOWN THIS OTHERS. WHO ARE PASSING LAWS TO GIVE THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO TENANTS IN CERTAIN CASES. WE ALREADY HAD BELIEVE FORECLOSURE WE HAD SOME SOME PROVISIONS LIKE THAT. AND NOW THESE TENANTS ART. ALL NECESSARILY ON THE BRINK OF BECOMING HOMELESS IF THEY HAPPEN TO BE FACED WITH A LIVING IN A PROPERTY DEBTS FOR CLOTHES BUT THE COULD BE YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE. AND I'M MY QUESTION IS NOT SO MUCH WHETHER THIS FUNDING. IS AVAILABLE SAY FOR THAT TYPE OF PURPOSE BUT RATHER. DO WE HAVE. IN DO WE HAVE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS DO WE HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS THAT MIGHT ENABLE EITHER OUR COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS ARE NON PROFITS FOR OUR TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE THIS KIND OF CAPITALS HARD SOMETIMES TO ACCESS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUY EITHER A FORECLOSED PROPERTY FOR. OTHER PROPERTIES THAT ARE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES DO WE HAVE ANY SOURCES OF FUNDS LIKE DONE THE STATE. SO I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT INTO THEIR VARIOUS HOUSING AND HOME RELATED ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS- ONE THING THAT'S MAYBE A CHASE INTO THE QUESTION THAT YOU MENTION IS WHEN IT COMES FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE WHICH IS OFFICE IN DIFFERENT COMPONENT OF PEOPLE DEALING WITH ADDICTION BUT WHAT YOU DESCRIBE IS ALSO A FORM OF UNIT. BUT FORM OF EIGHT. BUDGET ENACTED LAST SUMMER INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT AND THEN ONE OTHER PROGRAM AND I WAS LEGAL ASSISTANCE RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT AND NOW WE'RE WORKING ON THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT MONEY- BUT IN TERMS OF THE OTHER SPECIFIC CAPITAL PROGRAMS WOULD ALSO WANT TO GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE. OKAY GREAT AND THEN FINALLY IN TERMS BURKE HOLES. THINK OF A LOT OF ROOM FOR ME TO PUT ANY IN PRIORITY BUT CLEARLY WE HAVE. IN ADDITION TO THE GROWTH IN. ON BLACK POPULATION BEING HOMELESS AN AGING IS CHILDREN. AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE SOONER WE CAN GET A CHILD HOUSE STE. THE MOON BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THEM FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE SO HOW MUCH ARE WE- HAVE WE TARGETED ANY OF OUR PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE HOUSE. OUR HOME CHILDREN. SAID F. YOU DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WITHIN SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THAT THAT'S THE CAO WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. I WHICH IS FUNDED ABOUT NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THIS THIS FISCAL YEAR- ALSO REFERENCE IN YOUR AGENDA BRINGING FAMILIES HOME WHICH IS SUPPORTING THE CHILD WELFARE POPULATION OF FAMILY UNIFICATION. WORKS ALSO HAS A SIXTEEN DAY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR THOSE MIGHT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED AS WELL- SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS FOR THE POP PATIENT RECOGNIZED. IT'S TO THE IT THE BILL FOR YOUTH. TO ADDRESS AT WELL BOTH ON THE FAMILY PERSPECTIVES. FAMILIES TO BE HOUSE BUT ALSO FOR YOU. I WOULD SAY WELL IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CHILDREN BUT I THINK ON A COMPANY DUE TO THE REALLY KEY PIECE OF THIS THAT- HAS NOT RECEIVED A LOT OF FUNDING YOUR ATTENTION AND IN YEARS PAST AND THAT. BOTH THE HEAT FUNDING HAD 5% SET ASIDE AND THE HAPPENING AT 8% SATISFIED WITH THE DATA YOU THOMAS'S HEARING HERE A COUPLE DAYS AGO IN THE BUILDING- WITH A FULL FOLKS I THINK THAT. A LOT TO BE LEARNED FROM THAT IS REALLY HELPING COMMUNITIES FOCUS ON THAT IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO IN THE PAST. IN AND AS OF- TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE- THE- OTHER PROGRAMS WE MEAN THAT NOT DIRECTED DIRECTLY SELFIE WITH HOUSING. LOOKING AT- OUR FOSTER YOUTH POPULATION AND I THINK. IT MAY BE SENT TO BELLOW AS A BILL TO EXTEND THE AGING OUT OF TWENTY FIVE AND- KIND OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE EXISTING TAPE ROGRAM FOR THE TRANSITION AGE. USE THAT. THAT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY A- CERTAIN POPULATION THEM WHO QUALIFY FOR THE HOUSING. POST EIGHTEENTH THE INTO THE SYSTEM OF CERTAIN AGE. SO REALLY NEED TO LOOK. MORE DEEPLY AT. THE EXTENSION THAT WE DID CREATE. AN ARE ARE WE THROUGH POLICY EXCLUDING MORE KIDS THAN WE SHOULD. RIGHT THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE ON VEGAS INTO SKINNER CENTER WHERE CAL STATE SO I'VE A SUGGESTION FOR HOW I THOUGHT QUESTION AND SUGGESTION SO. ON THIS REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION THING MR DISPLAYING OFTEN. IN THE CLIMATE ADAPTATION WORLD WE HAVE THESE ORGANIC COLLABORATIVE SAID HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE LAST SIX FIVE SIX YEARS THAT ARE WORKING WITH PLANNING DOCUMENTS WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT WHAT TO DO YOU IN CLIMATE TO OUR SEALABLE RISER WHATEVER IT IS WINE WITH THESE ORGANIC COLLABORATIVE REGIONAL BODIES NOT BE. YOUR REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE THING WHY SINCE IT'S BASICALLY THE SIR HOMELESS ADVOCATES PLANNING STUFF WITH ACROSS JURISDICTION JUST A THOUGHT. JUST A THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE PART YOU HAVE TO ANSWER BUT TAKE THAT BACK TO THE YOU KNOW WHO IT WAS I WILL SAY SIMPLY THAT THE REGION'S HAVEN'T BEEN DEFINED YET AS- YOUR BILL SO- WE ARE WE ARE WE CAN DISCUSS A NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT CAN BE ONE OF THEM. ON THE CAPITAL PROJECTS AND I'M THINKING MANY CAPITAL PROJECTS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR HAVE DONE A LOT IT'S- PASS LAWS LEGISLATIONS ON EXCESS RE DWELLING UNITS. LITTLE UNITS LITTLE HOUSES HOUSES WITHIN A HOUSE GARAGE CONVERSIONS LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE BACKYARD ABOUT A THIRD TO A QUARTER OF THE COST. SO MY QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT TO TAKE SOME OF THIS CAPITAL MONEY THAT YOUR GUYS ARE DISHING OUT. AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY TO CONVERT THEIR GARAGE OR MAKE A COTTAGE FOR ITS FIFTY SIXTY EIGHTY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN BASICALLY. YOU'RE A FROM AS MISTER JONES. IF HE GETS BACK ON HIS FEET AND HE'S ABLE TO PAY. THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT STRETCHES OUT THAT AGREEMENTS YOU MAY NOT GET FIFTEEN YEARS BUT YOU GET TO WHATEVER THE DEAL IS WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH LL IN THAT SUBURBIA. OR IN THE RURAL CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE THIS POSSIBILITY. THE PROPOSAL THAT IS AN ALLOWABLE USE OF THE FUNDS. THERE'S A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION LA COUNTY I'M GONNA BUT MAYBE BUT TO THE NAME LA MAS I THINK- THAT IS THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO SCALE THAT MODEL IN LA COUNTY FOR PEOPLE EXPERTS IN HOMELESSNESS- TO THE RANCH TINGLING STATEWIDE BUT IT IS A VIABLE MODEL YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT TO SEE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO STRETCH YOUR TARA DOLLARS. IN IN THE SUGGESTION I THINK THIS IS A BACK YOU MISTER THIS WHY NOT THEN. ONE OF THE FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT WE HAVE FOR HOUSING. IS OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF REACHING THE FLOOR PRICE ON CAP AND TRADE FOR YOU. HOMELESS ADVOCATES IF WE WERE TO RAISE THE PRICE OF OUR FLOOR TO THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY. DOLLARS PER METRIC HI ACRE OF POLLUTION WE WOULD CREATE ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THIS MAY BILL FOR FIVE YEARS BUT 20% OF FOUR BILLION IS EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE ADMINISTRATION COULD TAKE THAT INCREMENTAL AND- USE THAT AS YOUR CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ALL THESE THINGS WERE TALKING ABOUT WHY IS THAT A BAD IDEA. THE SENATOR Y. CASCADE- THIS ISSUE ALSO CAME UP AT THE CLIMATE HEARING LAST WEEK SO I WILL TAKE YOUR FEET. SELECT I WILL TAKE YOUR FEEDBACK BACK TO ALL THE RELEVANT PARTIES. THE NOW SEE THE GOLDSTAR FOR CREATIVITY TODAY THAT'S RIGHT WE FOUND THE FUNDING SOURCE- TO OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE GUESTS MISTER. ALLEN YOU WELL FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT'S REPRESENTED BY YOUR PRESENTATIONS I KNOW- YOU KNOW EVERYONE HERE IS WORKING HARD ON TRYING TO ADDRESS WHAT IS BECOME ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRISES IN OUR BIGGEST SOCIAL CRISES IN OUR STATE SOMETHING I HEAR ABOUT A LOT FOR MY CONSTITUENTS WANTED A MOMENT TO BE HERE WITH ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. I MEAN I DO I. ALSO LITTLE SURPRISED THAT. AB THE KIND OF QUESTION THAT. BUT SOME OF THE PRESENTATIONS OF. I HAVE- YOU KNOW MAYBE ALLUDED TO A LITTLE BIT BUT THE BUT THE CORE QUESTION I THINK THAT THAT THAT THE CHAIR MITCHELL RACES THAT I THINK IS AT THE HEART OF ALEJO. SET OF CONCERNS IS THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF YOU KNOW HOW WE FULLY THOUGHT ALL THIS THROUGH WE OBVIOUSLY HAD HE BEEN HAPPENED AND- AND THERE'S SO MUCH REALLY GOOD WORK HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- YOU KNOW WE'VE CREATED ALL THESE INFRASTRUCTURES YOU KNOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICES. AND YET HERE WE ARE NOW COMING IN WITH A BRAND NEW. PROPOSAL ON. YOU KNOW. WITH A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING IDEAS AND I'M I'M CERTAINLY BEEN. NUMBER SO TRY TO SOAK IT ALL IN. VIDEO WE KNOW WE HAVE A CRISIS ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT QUICKLY- BUT THEN WE'RE ALSO. TRYING TO. YEAH CREATE THIS WHOLE NEW REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR INFRASTRUCTURE I'M I'M STILL NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ABOUT HOW THE REGIONS ARE GONNA BE DEFINED AND- HOW FUNDING IS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE REGIONS AND WHOSE CAN ACT AS A REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR AND- AND- ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IT IT IT ALMOST FEELS A LITTLE LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THE PLANE WHILE IT'S IN THE AIR AYE AYE YOU KNOW SO. I LIKE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THIS FITS INTO ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENED AND THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THE LOCAL LEVEL- I APPRECIATE THE- THIS IS SEEMS TO BE A- AN AGGRESSIVE OWNERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR'S TAKING OVER OVER THIS ENORMOUS ISSUE- BUT IS THIS IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT ON THIS TIME FRAME- THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I THINK THE LA- BROUGHT BRINGS UP IN ITS REPORT I JUST LOVE SOME. SOME DIRECT ANSWERS TO AYE CONCERNS FROM FOLKS. I SENATOR ALLEN- VEGAS WOULD OFTEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK- BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND THEN MY COLLEAGUES MAY WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL. I THINK THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WITH HE'D BEEN HAPPY TO THOSE INVESTMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS HEARING A LOT OF THAT FUNDING IS JUST DURING THE GROUND RIGHT NOW SO WE ARE WAYS ARE FOCUSED ON. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE PACIFIC OPPOSE ALL- LIKE YOU MENTIONED AND MIKE THE GOVERNOR SAID IN THE STATE OF STATE. EVERYONE IS PATIENT AND EVERYONE'S ACT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WHEN IT COMES TO THAT CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING FOR. CERVICAL THE TWO MAJOR. ARE TO. MOVE PEOPLE OFF THIS. AND INTO HOUSING AND DEVELOP MORE THOSE HOUSING UNITS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM. IS INTEGRATED WITH ALL THE OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AND SERVICES THAT THE STATE IS PROVIDING AND THAT THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES ARE PROVIDING. BUT WE THOUGHT WITH THIS ONE TIME SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND. PUT IT RIGHT IN THE TENS OF THOSE TWO PURPOSES WAY OUT THREE VERY CLEAR OBJECTIVES IN TERMS OF HOW THE MONIES. AND I THINK THE BROADER. FRAME FOR IT THAT IS TWO FOLD WOW FOR. LOCATION OF APPROACH. CONTINUE ACCOUNTED. PATRICK'S AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS RECOGNIZING. I THINK IN SOME THE QUESTIONS ABILITY TO THIS WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND POTS OF MONEY- AND THEN WE- HAVE SO MUCH OF THE FUNDING BY SPECIFIC FORMULA. IT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT OF THE FUNDING HERE A LITTLE BIT OF THE FUNDING THERE. AND SO. I THINK EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT A NEW APPROACH IS NEEDED AND SO. THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEST BET FOR HOW THAT CAN GO BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO. WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT IN TERMS OF. OUR FIGHTING ALL THE DETAILS TO GET EVERYTHING RIGHT BECAUSE IT IS NEW. AND THEN I THINK THE LAST THING THAT I. SAY IS THIS IS ONE TIME FIND. AS DISCUSSED. DURING I THINK EVERYONE AT THE TABLE AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ONE TO IDENTIFY AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING. AND I THINK AS THE MATCH CONTAINS. I'M SORRY. WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT YOUR PRO IS A REAL MOVING THE BILL AND WHERE WE SHOULD BE TO THAT I CAN MY CONCERN IS BECAUSE ON GOING FIGHT IS ONE TIME FINDING AND YOUR CREATING THIS WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE TAKE IT IS THAT YOU KNOW I GUESS THAT MAKES THAT MAKES ME EXTRA NERVOUS. IF WAS BILL IF THIS IS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT. WE DECIDED AND COURTNEY DID STRATEGIC MANNER THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD THIS WHOLE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE NEW WAY. FOR US TO APPROACH HER. OUR REGIONAL AND LOCAL AND- STATEWIDE NEEDS. IT THAT WAY I WOULD FEEL BETTER BUT BUT- IT. SHOULD ONE TIME FINDING GO TOWARD THE EXISTING SUCCESSFUL INFRASTRUCTURE. SO I THINK THAT THE KEY THING HERE FOR THIS IS A WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE METRICS AND THEY ARE IN THE TRAILER BILL. ARE VERY CLEAR SO. CERTAINLY THE- TAKEN. WILL BUY YOU WAITED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIND OF WHETHER WE'RE ACHIEVING THOSE TARGETS THAT ARE SET OUT IN THE TRAILER BILL. YEAH WELL. OKAY I CANNOT FOLLOW UP ON YOUR POINT BEFORE YOU GO ON DID THIS I'M SITTING HERE LOOKING AT- THE SACRAMENTO REPRESENTATIVE HAVING HEARD. THE WONDERFUL WORK THEY'VE DONE WITH HE BEEN HAPPENED I'M WONDERING SO THAT ENDS. HOW YOU GUYS BRIDGE MINE SO WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SACRAMENTO EXAMPLE WE HEARD TODAY WELL FIRST A WE'RE GONNA BE MINE IN MONITORING HOW THAT FUNDING IS BEING USED TO THAT'S FINE THAT SENATE FUNDING IS BEING SPENT THIS YEAR I THINK SECOND- THAT MONEY WAS ALSO ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE BUDGET THE LAST TWO YEARS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES- NEED MORE ASSISTANCE I THINK A NUMBER THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE WORKING ON. A RECOGNIZED PRICE THEY ALL NEED FOR A SIX YOU KNOW WE WANT TO FIND WAYS WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT GOVERNOR- MADE SO CLEAR IN THE STATE OF THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO FIND A STABLE ON GOING REVENUE SOURCE. HAS AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHERE UNDER SHOULD GO BUT CERTAIN. KEY ACTORS AT THE TABLE. AND ALL A PART POLLUTION. I THINK REALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THIS FINE AN THE REQUEST FOR EARLY ACTION. IT'S MORE THE SENSE THAT WE CAN'T WAIT AND WHICH IS WHY EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM IS FAST AND A NUMBER OF WAYS YOU CAN APPROACH IT ARE PRETTY FAST. WE WANTED TO CONFINE THE FINE TO ADD VERY SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES VERY SPECIFIC SET OF SOLUTIONS. AND I GET THE CONCERNED ABOUT ONE TIME FIVE. AND YOU KNOW THE MONEY GOES OUT THE DOOR AND THEN. WHAT HAPPENS TO IT. BUT VERY CLEAR PATRICK ON IT WOULD BE OF. BEFORE HE FOR FINDINGS. BY THE TO THIS PROGRAM. AS I CAN GET BACK TO. ALLEN I ALSO. THAT THAT WE'VE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND HEARD THE GOVERNOR LAWTON CLEAR TERMS OR IN ACCESS TO THE FUNDING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND YET WE DON'T HAVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET. PROVIDE CLEARLY TO US TODAY ABOUT. HOW THE REGION'S WILL BE DEFINED WHO THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS WILL BE. AND YET WE ALREADY HAVE AN INFRASTRUCTURE WITH KEEPING HOUSE. WHERE IT CAN HIT THE GROUND IT SEEMS TO ME A LITTLE FASTER THAN. LIKELY WILL WITH A YET TO BE DEFINED. INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND DILATATION. RITTER ALLEN READ THE GOING TO SUCH A POINT YOU pBEEN SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY. AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CHALLENGES- I'VE BEEN. ASKING US TO SPEND UP. ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OF MONEY WITHOUT. YOU KNOW A CLEAR DEFINED. STRATEGIES AND I THAT'S THAT'S THE OLD. FEAR IN AND I THINK IT'S I THINK WE KNOW THIS IS SUCH AN ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY YOU'RE ASKING FOR US TO INVEST I THINK. THERE'S A LOT OF WILLINGNESS TO INVEST THIS KIND OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM. AND YET I THINK THE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW IN THE ALLEY- ARTICULATES IS VERY VERY EFFECTIVELY. REALLY NEEDS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE THA THERE'S A CLEAR STRATEGY HERE AND THAT THERE'S A CLEAR STRUCTURE AND- THAT I THINK IS THAT. THE CENTRAL CONCERN THAT I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE. SO AND I SEE YOU PRESSING YOUR- IT JUST MADE ME MAKE ONE POINT IS TO POINT OUT THAT THE FINDING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH CAL AIM THE ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IN LIEU OF SERVICES THAT HOUSING BATTLE. THAT IS AN ON GOING THE WOULD BE A NEW MEDI CAL BENEFITS SO THAT THOSE TWO PIECES ARE ON GOING- PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THIS. THIS TOPIC. I WOULD ALSO JUST PIGGY BACK AND TELL THE STORY OF- YOU KNOW GOING TO MY BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITH THE PROPOSED. CONTRACT FOR THE LA COUNTY FLEX POOL. AND THEY SAID TO ME WITH A LITTLE LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO BUILD THE PLANE WHILE YOU'RE FLYING IT- YOU KNOW WE HAD FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS COMMITTED WHAT'S NOW OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION. OUR ANNUAL- FLEXIBLE BUDGET MATCHES BRING CORNERS LOAN INCLUDING THE RENT SUBSIDIES OTHER PASSED THROUGH FUNDS. AND BY. DEMONSTRATING THE POWER OF THAT MODEL WE HAVE TO SECURE ONE GOING INVESTMENTS VOTER APPROVED- THE- INVESTMENTS FOR OP RENT SUBSIDIES SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ON AN ON GOING SUSTAINABLE WAY. AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS FROM LA CARE PHILANTHROPY- AND WE'RE SEEING THAT PROCESS ALREADY MARRIED HERE IT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH. FIVE MILLION COMMITTED TO HEALTHCARE AGENCY. I THINK YOU WILL SEE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. UP BUT CONCERNS ARE ARE ARE LEGITIMATE- WE BELIEVE THAT. IT TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REFLECTS ON OF THE BEST PRACTICES. IN THE EXPORT. IT IS NOT STARTING SOMETHING NEW TO CLICK IT IF. BUT RATHER PROVIDING A SET OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND STAFFING RESOURCES AND PROVEN STRATEGIES THAT WILL ENHANCE THE CAPACITY. OF EXISTING LOCALITIES CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM. TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING UNITS. WITH A FOLLOW UP ON THAT I MEAN LOVE TO GET LOT MORE FOR ME ABOUT WHAT EXISTING DATA OR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT YOU'RE GONNA USED TO CREATE THE REGIONAL PROGRAM AND- HE USED TO DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES WITHIN THE REGIONS ARE. GOING TO BE A COUPLE GUIDING DATA POINTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF THIS. ALLOCATION TO DECISIONS YES THE- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S CURRENTLY POSTED ONLINE AND FINANCES WEBSITE SPEAKS TO THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BE USING SO IT IS. LOOKING AT POINT IN TIME COUNT- IN THE END AND THAT. ADDITIONAL NEED FOR HOUSING FOR PERSONS WHO ARE EXISTING HOMELESS POPULATION IT ALSO HAS THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE BURDENED BY THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE- TO INCOME RATIO. AND THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS PER CAPITA IN HOUSING NEED- DETERMINED BY INCOME LEVEL AND THAT FOURTH COMPONENT THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER IS RACIAL EQUITY SO. THOSE WOULD BE THE FACTORS THAT WOULD BE USED TO DEVELOP THE METHODOLOGY THE CONVERSATION ON. KIND OF THE WEIGHTS THAT WOULD BE USES ON GOING AT. NOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF HOW IT LOOKS ACROSS THE REGION AND WHAT THAT WOULD YIELD IN TERMS OF THE ALLOCATIONS. LET ME BRING UP BUT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT HAS IS VERY RELATED TO WHAT YOU JUST BROUGHT UP AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER BON AND TALKED ABOUT AND LA. LA CITY COUNCIL A WEEK OR TWO AGO AND THAT'S THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE FACT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE CONSIDERED. NOT HOMELESS ENOUGH. TO GET SERVICES SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO IN THE HELL IN THE REPORT TALKS ABOUT- OTHER PEOPLE THE COLLEGE KIDS YOU MAY BE COUCH SURFING OR- OR YOU KNOW- HOMELESS FAMILY THAT MAY BE GOING IN AND OUT OF. STAYING WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT SO MUCH- THERE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST HANGING AROUND THE EDGES IS ONE THING THAT WE KEEP HEARING. LOCAL FOLK. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE- YEAH. IT THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HOME A LITTLE BIT INVESTMENT CAN GO A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF DETERMINING WHETHER THEY END UP OF WE KNOW. MORE MORE. A MORE SERIOUS CASE. AND I GUESS A ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT A LOT OF THE- EXISTING BUREAUCRACY NAME AND I WORRY THAT WE MAY. IF YOU WITH SOME OF THE THINGS YOU JUST MENTIONED TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT IT WITH THE COURTS INDICATORS THAT WE MADE DOUBLE DOWN ON A SYSTEM WHERE- WITH THERE'S VERY. FEW DEDICATED SOURCES FOR FUNDING FOR FOLKS WHO OF. LOW ACUITY WHO YOU KNOW OR THE LITTLE MAY BE EASIER TO HELP BETTER I AT HIGH RISK OF ANY UP ON THE STREETS AND SO. ON ARE WE GET IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SET ASIDE SOME MONEY TO HELP THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE LIVING IN CARS PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL HAVING. HAVE THEIR JOBS OR MAYBE COUCH SURFING- BUT YOU KNOW THEY'VE BEEN. THEY'VE BEEN. STUCK IN A PARKING LOT MY DISTRICT FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO RESOURCE TO GUIDE THEM OUT AND THEY'RE JUST. YOU KNOW. AND YOU KNOW. CAR PAYMENT AWAY FROM MISS AND LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEN ENDING UP ON THE STREETS ENTIRELY OR- ONE MISS SHOWER WHEN MR. BUS YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO HELP THOSE FOLKS. SO I WOULD SAY THAT THE HOT FUNDING- I MENTIONED BEFORE CAN BE USED ON PREVENTION AND SHELTER DIVERSION AND SO THAT WOULD ADDRESS A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS YOU JUST MENTIONED. WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW ON AND THINKING ABOUT AND AS WERE REVIEWING THE APPLICATIONS WE'VE ASKED THEM TO SORT OF TAKE A LOOK AT. WHAT HOW THEY'RE USING THEIR FUNDING AND WHAT OTHER RESOURCES THEY HAVE AN AND REALLY TRYING TO ENSURE. THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE AT A HEARING IN SAN FRANCISCO. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND I THINK MAYOR SHAFT BUT REALLY WELL SORT OF A AN INTERVENTION BY I APPROPRIATE RATIO OF INTERVENTIONS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. SO THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST BUILDING SHALL NOT JUST BERMAN BUILDING PERMITS A PART OF HOUSING WHICH TO HAVE ENTIRE IN YOUR CHIN SYSTEM THAT CONTRAST FOR YOUR- ON THE- OF. AT THAT RATE OR ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO A COMMON. AND SO. THE FLEX. AND OF HOW. REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD OUT THAT ANTI SET OF INNER. LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE COMMUNITIES ALREADY INVESTING IN A WHAT GAP YOU NEED TO FILL TO HAVE THAT FULL RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS. YES AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT THE ONE THING THE STATE HAS PROVIDED IN THEIR PROGRAMS IS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY AND IT IS CRUCIAL FROM PREVENTION TO HOUSING AND DIVERSION KEEPING PEOPLE AND HOUSING BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY SO WHEN YOU COME TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO SAY YOU COULD USE THIS FOR DIVERSION YOU COULD USE THIS FOR PREVENTION OR DO YOU USE THAT FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE AND SO YOU'RE MAKING TOUGH CHOICES ACROSS THE BOARD SO ES HAPPENED IN CAN PROVIDE THAT. WILL IT BE USED IN THAT WAY BASED UPON THE LOCAL PRIORITIES IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE. CAN I ASK OUR YOU KNOW HI EIGHTY EIGHT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN LA COURSES COME IN FOR WITH A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FUNDING PROPOSAL HOW DO YOU SEE. WE ARE WE ARE DO YOU SEE THESE PROPOSALS BEING FUNDAMENTALLY CONFLICT JEWEL OR OR HARM IT DO YOU SEE A WAY FOR US TO MARRY THE NEEDS AND ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE ON THE GROUND IN LA WITH. THAT WHICH IS BEING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR. I THINK THERE'S A THERE IS A WAY TO THREAD THE NEEDLE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT IN LA IS THIS CHALLENGE AROUND IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE OF HOW DO YOU. BUILD A SYSTEM IT'S REALLY EFFICIENT MAKE TWEAKS AS NEEDED- BUT ALSO DON'T TAKE A STEP BACKWARD IT UNINTENTIONALLY FRAGMENTING THINGS AND BREAKING THE CURRENT SYSTEM A PART IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER- AND THAT'S A HARD BALANCE FOR US SO. I THINK FOR US WHAT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO DO AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY IS MAKING SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE MEASURING IS. HEALTH OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM AND NOT JUST DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE SYSTEM SO WHAT I MEAN IS. HOW THE HOW DO WE LOOK AT HOW THIS. IS FUNCTIONING WITH ALL OF ITS COMPONENTS AND HOW THOSE ARE INTERACTING AND USE THAT TO JUDGE THE EFFICACY OR THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SYSTEM. NOT JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING PLATE AND IT ARM HOUSING OR A DECREASE IN THE ON SHELTERED BY WHAT'S THE ACTUAL OUT COMMON IN ARE WE- ARE WE TAKING A BALANCED APPROACH IN OUR INTERVENTIONS AND SO. PART OF THE CONCERN FROM THE OUTLAYS BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH WORK DONE TO BUILD UP A SYSTEM THAT. IT BALLOT NUMBER. BRING ON ANOTHER LAYER BERMAN. PUT THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE CITY COUNTY CO MODEL. FURTHER SOME THAT WERE REALLY WORKING. TO BRING TOGETHER SPECIAL GIVEN THE LOCAL RESOURCES WE HAVE COME AND A LOT. HOW DO YOU DO THERE ARE. I GO OUT. IF PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LA COUNTY- ELLIE CITY IN THE C. O. C. BUT I KNOW THAT NOT EVERY JURISDICTION IS LIKE THAT SO I THINK. ALLOWING THE JURISDICTIONS TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE NEED TO DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR THE MONEY TO COME IN I THINK THAT THE- THE LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE. ADDICTS ARE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEIR OWN. THEIR OWN JURISDICTIONS. OKAY I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ANSWERS AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE- THE FOR PARENTS OF THAT OF THE CHAIRMAN. YEAH THIS IS I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYONE HERE ABOUT ABOUT. YOU KNOW NORM IS A PROBLEM THAT THIS IS ON OUR ON OUR STREETS AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW I'M- I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE- EXTRAORDINARY ATTENTION THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE MINISTRATION GIVING TO THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S IMMENSELY IMPORTANT- I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- CAN AFFORD INVEST THIS KIND OF MONEY WHICH I THINK. WE WERE INTO A RIGHT GONNA CHRIS STRUCK SECTION IN YOUR FOR. IN AND NOT RECREATE THE WHEEL UNNECESSARILY AND SO I MEAN THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS TO BE AT THE END OF THIS LOOKING BACK AT THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND- NOT SEE. PROPERTY YET SEEING ENORMOUS. OF PUBLIC IN. AND THAT'S- OKAY TV MY CONCERN I KNOW THIS BUDGETARY SHARES THAT CONCERN I JUST THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO. ENGAGE IN A VERY ROBUST MANNER TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A CLEAR. WELL THOUGHT THROUGH STRATEGY IS CAN BE WELL INTEGRATED WITH THE SERVICE FROM THERE'S ON THE GROUND. THAT THAT WILL. GET THE- IN I YOU COMMITTEE TO THAT MATTER CHAIR BUT- I IT WILL BE ABLE TO. DIEM BY MAJOR CAN. OF MINE. FORWARD THE SEVERITY THIS CHALLENGE. THANK YOU CENTER MORE LAW THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- APPRECIATE THE CIRCLE AROUND THE TABLE. IT'S KIND OF A NICE OPTED WE SHOULD TAKE A PHOTO- I'M JUST CURIOUS HAVE ANYONE HAVE YOU BEEN TO HAVEN FOR HOPE IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS. MISS MAYOR STEINBERG BEEN REFERRING TO IT AND I'VE BEEN THERE AND I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO JUST DO A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THAT THE SILLY. WHAT THAT CITIES DOING A TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS SITUATION- IT'S A CAMPUS THAT- IS RATHER REMARKABLE- IT IS NEAR DOWNTOWN BUT THE RIVER WALK IS NICE. IN THE ALAMO IS NICE AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. AROUND HERE IN SACRAMENTO OTHER PLACES SO IT'S A MODEL PRIVATE PUBLIC OPPORTUNITY IT'S DOES DOING REAL WELL WOULD. IT BE WELL WORTH YOUR TIME. I JUST MAYBE TALK TO THE AG ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN GET REIMBURSED. LEX POOL ARE BRILLIANT CORNERS- MISTER PICKLE I JUST WANT TO KNOW I DON'T HAVE A TREND I JUST SEE BIG NUMBER SO FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN IS A DOING THIS SAID THAT IT'S BY CAN COME DOWN- WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S THE TREND SO- WIT WHEN OCTOR MEETS CAT AND HIS TEAM ANNOUNCED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF- HEALTH SERVICES ONE TRY TO- RE HOUSING KEEP HOUSE AT TEN THOUSAND- HIGH FREQUENCY- UTILIZES A PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THEY CAME OUT WITH THE- A REQUEST- IN OUR IF THE THAT SAID THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO DOUBLE IN EACH OF THE FIRST FOUR YEARS SO THREE HUNDRED UNITS OCCURRED AND HOUSEHOLD THREE HOUSE IN THE FIRST YEAR SIX HUNDRED THE SECOND YEAR UP TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED- AND SO AS I SHARED OVER THE FIRST FOUR YEARS WE ALREADY SURPASSED FIVE THOUSAND- PEOPLE AND WE'RE NOW OVER. TOWARDS THOUSAND IT'S BEEN. THAT TYPE OF GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR- FAIRLY SUBTLY I WOULD SAY THAT WITHIN THAT- PART OF THE FLEXIBILITY- IS THAT THERE WERE ABLE TO PAVE IT AS NEEDED. WHEN NEW OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES OR NEW CHALLENGES THAT NEED TO BE RESOLVED. ONE OF THE BIG CHANGES THAT HAPPENED. BOB AFTER THE LAUNCH OF. THE HOUSING FOR HEALTH DIVISION WITHIN THE HEALTH AGENCYAND THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POLL WAS THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION AND RE ENTRY. AND THE OFFICE OF DIVERSION RE ENTRY HAS BEEN A MAJOR SOURCE OF REFERRALS- INTO THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL SENT TO CREATION A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THAT'S FOLKS THAT ARE. THAT HAVE JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT- THAT ARE EITHER HOME. MINUTE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESSNESS SO WITHIN THE GROWTH WE'VE SEEN PARTICULAR. GROW FASTER THAN OTHERS OR SUBSIDE. WE HAD A RAPID RE HOUSING MODEL THAT NO LONGER EXISTS- CALLED HOUSING AND JOBS COLLABORATIVE WITHIN THE FLEXIBLE WE HAVE AN ON GOING. PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY PROBATION THAT STILL GROWING CALL BREAKING BARRIERS. THAT THOUGH HAS REUNITED PROBATIONERS WITH THEIR FAMILY AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THE SAME PACKAGE OF SERVICES. GROWTH HAS BEEN PRETTY. AND STEADY AND- WORK BEING TOP HOUSING SHORTAGE. NOT BAD THERE'S NO ROOM. WHERE YOU FOR THE INVENTORY EVERYWHERE WE- IN SAN FRANCISCO WHICH ISN'T EVEN TIGHTER- HOUSING MARKET OBVIOUSLY IT BUT THAT PENINSULA THERE- SUGGEST SOME. OF THE ENVELOPE ANALYSIS BELIEVE THEY'RE OVER FIVE UNITS FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS CURRENTLY HOMELESS. THAT POINT COUNT SAN SAYS. ARE JUST A MATTER OF THE- STAFF WE HAD A- T. OF. ENGAGEMENT BUT SO TO US I SAY BRING. PROFESSION SERVE. MATT AND MY. THE MY- OF OUR UP. NEW UNIT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FIRE OR REPEAT BUSINESS FOR. WE HAVE LAND THAT WE'VE WORKING AND SIMON FOR OVER A DAY. AND THESE ARE A HIKE APART SETTING. SO THEN DO YOU HAVE A TUBE. DOCU OR SOMETHING THAT YOUR SLEEP WE HAVE WE DO HAVE. ACTUALLY TIPPING POINT COMMUNITY- A FOUNDATION AND SERVICES GO THAT'S ONE OF OUR PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS- IT'S NOT BRANDED AS BRITAIN CORNERS VIDEO BUT- AS PART OF THE LAUNCH OF THE SAN FRANCISCO FLEXIBLE HOUSING SO THE PEOPLE THIS YEAR. THEY DID A CUTE LITTLE ANIMATED VIDEO THAT I COULD GET TO A LINK- AND WE HAVE SOME OTHER MATERIALS AS WELL I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STORY SORRY DAD LEFT TO LEARN MORE- IS THERE AN APP BERNIE. THING THAT YOU USE OR DO WE GO WE DON'T USE WE DON'T USE AN APP BUT I CAN I CAN REACH BACK OUT TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR STAFF AND MINISTRY GREAT AND THEN. LAST QUESTION I HAVE- THE GOVERNOR I WAS ABLE IN HIS STATE DATE. AND MENTIONED. LAW MENTION. LETTERMAN SHORT ACT. AND MENTIONED THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE THAN JUST A FIFTY ONE FIFTY OLD BY. INTERPRETATION SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS. BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS WHAT WAS HE SAYING BETWEEN THE LINES WHAT DOES IT MEAN. ALL ALL OF THE GLADLY DEFER TO OTHERS ON THAT ONE BUT BUT BUT I WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SAY THAT THERE'S SOME EMERGING CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE NEED FOR SOME HIGH ACUITY PROBABLY SMALL SITE MODELS- AND BRING CORNERS IS EAGER TO BE PART OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE CREATING TOM HIGHLY- SERVICE AND RATES SPECIALIZED- RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE MOVING OUT DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. AND I'LL JUST SPEAKER TO THE GOVERNOR'S COMMENTS- NOTHING BETWEEN THE LINES- THE SMOKE OUTLINED IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL TYPES OF CHANGES. THAT YOU WANT TO SEE BUT YOU ARE CORRECT THAT- ON LIKE THIS CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING FUND WHERE WE HAVE A PROPOSAL AND NOW SEE THERE'S A LOT OF FEEDBACK IN THE CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING. ON THESE CHANGES HE SET UP THE BROAD OUTLINES OF WHAT HE WANTS TO DO BUT WE HAVE NOT- DEMONSTRATIONS NOT PUT OUT A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL YET. I'M I AM ONE WHO BELIEVES THAT LPS IS REALLY FAILED OR MAYBE THE STATE HAS FAILED AND NOT PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY SERVICES WHEN THEY CLOSE THE INSTITUTIONS IN THIS BEEN GOING ON FOR FIFTY YEARS. AND SO I WAS. REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE OF THE STATE AND THAT. WE'RE LOOKING FIND ME AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE TRANSITION FROM THE INSTITUTIONS TO THE STREETS TO THE JAILS AND SAW THE LARGEST MENTAL INSTITUTION AN ORANGE COUNTY IS THIS THE CENTRAL JAIL IN DOWNTOWN SANTANA SO I'M I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING BUT I'VE GONE DOWN THIS ROAD NOW BEEN BEAT UP IN COMMITTEE. SO I'M JUST KERN THIS. WHAT WILL HE BE DOING THAT THAT WILL HELP THIS LEGISLATURE CHANGE ITS PERSPECTIVE ON LPS SO SICK TO THINGS AND SO MY COLLEAGUES MAY WANT TO ELABORATE THE FIRST THING IS I THINK MY ONE THING I'D SAY THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT SAYING IS YOU KNOW WE SHOULDN'T ROLL THE CLOCK BACK TO EXACTLY WHERE I WAS BEFORE YOU KNOW HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE DID IS WE EMPTIED THOSE INSTITUTIONS WITH THE PROMISE THAT THERE WOULD BE COMMUNITY SERVICES ON THE OTHER AND THEN FOR A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED. REASONS DOES EVER REALLY PROVIDED AT A LEVEL THAT WAS NEAT- BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE STATUS QUO ANTE IS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION OR ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO USE IN A DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM THERE AND THEN I THINK AT THE SAME THING AND COLLEAGUES CAN ELABORATE ON THIS IS A WE TALKED ABOUT POPULATION THAT'S EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE AT RISK OF THAT THAT ALL HAS THESE COUPLE CORING DISORDER. EIGHT PEOPLE IN A MIX OF SETTINGS SOME HAVE FAMILY WANT TO COMPEL SOME DON'T HAVE ANY FAMILY AT ALL- SOME EXPERT IT'S BOUNCE. SEVERE MENTAL. NUMBER THAT FOR OKAY. HEY THAT WAS THAT HE AND MINISTRY ARE NOT SATISFY WITH WHERE WE ARE NOW BOTH IN TERMS OF THE THAT CAN SERVICE WAS WERE NEVER PROVIDED THAT LEVEL AND THE FACT THAT SOME THESE LAWS WHILE MAYBE WELL INTENTIONED I PERHAPS BECOME TOO RESTRICTIVE IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE NEED TO ATTACK THIS ISSUE. YOU BECAUSE WE WOULD NEVER LET SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMER'S JUST ROAM THE STREETS RIGHT AND- AND SO WE'RE DEALING WAS SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE THAT JUST. NEED THE RIGHT MEDICATION WHAT THE RIGHT DOSAGE TO. START MAYBE MAINSTREAMING AND DEALING WITH THEIR SCHIZOPHRENIA AND THE REST. AND JUST TO KIND OF JUST LET HIM STAY OUT THERE DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY- SO THAT'S WHY I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE OF THE STATE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD. TO THE LEGISLATIVE APPROACH. AT IN ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP LET ME KNOW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK. ALL THE WORKERS ZERO. WELL IF I MAY IN MY BRIEF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND BRING IT BACK TO MORE COMPLICATION FOR YOU. BUT I WAS ASKED WHY DON'T WE FOCUS ON. TREATMENT FOR BATTERERS AS A PART OF THIS. IT THE INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME ABUSIVE DOMESTIC PARTNER WELL ANYWAY BUT I THINK YOU SEE IT THE MARK REMARKS I MADE BEFORE I LEAVE- THAT I THINK ON THE COMMITTEE THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT. THERE'S ENTHUSIASM ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT THERE'S REALLY SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT. THAT IT MAY NOT BE QUITE COOKED YET ONE ELEMENT OF THIS IS THE VERSION AND I HAVE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF- THAT ACTIONS THAT HAVE. RUINED ALL APART. OF THE SUCCESS OF DIVERSION AND THAT IS THE DRUG COURT GO BACK TO THE EIGHTIES AND I WORKED WITH THESE DRUG COURTS IN THE COUNTIES ARE REPRESENTED THEY'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. BECAUSE THEY WERE BUILT ON A MODEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. TREATMENT A BABY AND THERE'S CONSEQUENCES IF YOU DON'T. WELL PROP FORTY SEVEN WIPE THAT OUT. AND NOW THE OF THOSE WHO ARE OF NEED OF TREATMENT. THEY OPT FOR THE EASY FLASH INCARCERATION WHICH FRANKLY FOLKS IS A JOKE. IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP ANYBODY WITH THEIR ADDICTION SO THEY JUST SIT IN THE IN THE JAIL FOR FIVE DAYS AND THEY'RE RIGHT BACK ON THE STREETS AND RIHT INTO THEIR HAPPEN AGAIN SO THAT TOTALLY UNDERMINED THE MERIT OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK FOR DECADES. THAT'S WHY IT'S A PREMIUM FOR US TO REALLY CAREFULLY EXAMINE. HOW THIS ALL FITS TOGETHER. AND THE REGIONAL STRUCTURE MAKES LOGICAL SENSE BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION IS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED I THINK THE POINT THAT I MAKE AND WOOD WELL ON HERE. IT'S GOING TO NEED A LOT OF WORK THIS COMPLICATED IDEA. IT AND THEN SOME OF THE APPLICATION I THINK OF OBVIOUSLY WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND GET A LOT OF THE GOVERNOR FOR TAKEN A LOOK AT THAT NEED. IT JUST JUST PROVIDING HOUSING. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT OTHER ASPECT THAT I DID THROW IN A HOMELESS ADVOCATE WHO SAID JIM WE CAN. BUILD SHELTERS FOR PEOPLE BUT- THE COST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE BECAUSE OUR STATE REQUIREMENTS IMPOSITIONS AND REGULATIONS. THAT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR ANYBODY. PROVIDING HOUSING FOR HOMELESS OR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN BEING ABLE A YOUNG COUPLE TO BUY A HOME. SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT IN THE MACRO WE NEED TO EXAMINE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME MORE WORK THAT'S ALL. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD HERE TODAY I THINK IT'S- BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING I'M- ALL OVER THE STATE- A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND THEN A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- ONE IS- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE REGIONAL. INFRASTRUCTURE A DISCUSSION- ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND I HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT- WE HAVE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER AND OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. THAT DON'T FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF REASONS AND I REPRESENT A RURAL MORE RURAL DISTRICT- THAT HAS PARTS OF OR ALL OF IN INTER IN TOTAL SIX COUNTY SO I'VE KIND OF LOOKED AT- WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH HE BEEN HAPPY ON IN IN THOSE COUNTIES AND SOME ARE. DOING A REAL GOOD JOB IN OTHERS- ARE REALLY STRUGGLING AND SO I GUESS THE FOR THE FIRST QUESTION IS- HAVE WE LOOKED AT WHERE THE SUCCESSES ARE AND WHAT'S COST THEM OR WHAT TO MAKE SUCCESS AND WERE WE'VE- WHERE IT'S THAT THE- RESTRICTIONS OF. STRUGGLED I'M I'M A SUPPORTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO QUITE FRANKLY MY DRUTHERS STARTED DOING THIS WORK. THIS BUDGET WORK WOULD HAVE BEEN TO MAKE GRANTS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES AND THEN REQUIRED THEM TO WORK WORK TOGETHER- BUT- SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION IS HAVE WE LOOKED AT THAT AND IT DO WE HAVE ANY ANALYSIS OF WHERE THAT'S- THAT'S WORKED IN WHERE IT'S NOT. AND THEN ON. THE OTHER QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TODAY. AND WE DON'T HAVE ARE THE STATE'S MAJOR HOUSING ENTITY AT THE TABLE SO THE QUESTION. IS RAISED WHERE'S EACH SEAT IN COLLEGE OF A WHICH DO THE FINANCING AND- REALLY DOG WHETHER COMMUNITIES ARE BUILDING HOUSING OR NOT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT AT THE TABLE I WONDER IF THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. I CENTER CARRIER ALL SPEAK BRIEFLY TO BOTH OF THOSE AND THEN COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE COMMENTS AS WELL I THINK ON THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT WHEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT ONE SIZE. DOESN'T FIT ALL AND SO AND WE'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT NOT OF COURSE IT'S- A BIG STATE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES OVER FOUR HUNDRED CITIES. AND SO I THINK- WE HAVE DONE YET IN THE ANALYSIS THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO DO BUT- IN TERMS OF SPEAKING WITH ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SOME OF THEM REPRESENTED AT THIS TABLE. TO INFORM HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS THINKING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. AT ONE POINT THAT I DEFINITELY WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS- IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE AND IS GONE A LOT OF ATTENTION THAT. NONPROFIT YOU KNOW NON CITIES OR COUNTIES. CAN APPLY TO BE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT EMPHASIZE THAT COUNTIES AND CITIES CAN ALSO APPLY TO BE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR SO THEY- ANY. ENTITY THAT APPLIES IS SUBJECT TO A 10% ADMINISTRATIVE CAP BUT- CERTAINLY IF A CITY OR COUNTY- IS DOING GREAT WORK ALREADY. AND THEY'RE COLLABORATING WITH THE OTHERS LOCAL. STICKS THAT ARE THERE. AND THEY APPLY. FOR THE FAA. THE RISE. TOP OF THE NOW BASED ON THE CALL. IN THEIR- I THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY WILL WIN THE REASON ON. WRITER APPLICATION AND BE ABLE TO. CONTINUE TO COURT WITH THE DAY. FINE AND THEN ON THE- QUESTION. ANOTHER TABLES ALREADY PRETTY CROWDED WITH A LOT OF US ALREADY. I WILL SAY TO JUST SPEAKING. FOR FINANCE I THINK- OFTEN WITH THESE HEARINGS YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH GROUND TO COVER AND WE- TEND TO FOCUS A LOT ON WHAT'S NEW IN THE BUDGET. THIS YEAR. THERE WERE TWENTY. TWO HOUSING PARTICULAR THERE WAS ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FUNDING. LAST YEAR- IN IN THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE HOMELESSNESS. FUNDING THAT WE DISCUSSED. SO I THINK. THAT WAS A LOT OF THE HOUSING DEPARTMENTS THEY'RE LOOKING OUT IMPLEMENTED FUNDING. AND HERE OF COURSE ONE OF THE BIG YOU PROPOSALS IS THAT ACCESS TO HOUSING BONDS. WITH HHS AND DSS SPECIFICALLY BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE. BROAD ARRAY OF PROGRAMS. YEAH I THAT THE CHALLENGE THAT FOR ME JUST IN TERMS OF HOW WE'VE ROLLED OUT MONEY IN THE PAST IS ON THE CEO SEES IT PLAYED AT THE CENTRAL ROLE- AND- IN SOME COMMUNITIES A DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB BUT- THEY THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. IS THAT WE HAVEN'T REQUIRED A PUBLIC ACCOUNTING OF WHERE THE MONEY GOES WE HAVEN'T- REQUIRED THEM TO HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH. INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC- I HAVE NO IDEA WITH THEM THE MONEY IS GOING TO THE CEO. THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY GOING INTO VOUCHERS OR ANYTHING ELSE- AND FRANKLY IN A COUPLE OF THE OF A- OF THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT I BASS FOR IT FOR. INFORMATION AND- AND QUITE FRANKLY HAVE NOT BEEN. WELL RECEIVED ASKING FOR THAT INFORMATION AND TO ME IT'S KIND OF WHAT I'VE SAID IS LOOK YOU'RE ASKING ME TO VOTE. FOR MORE MONEY- IT'S A CRISIS WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING AND SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED. ABOUT THAT BUT BUT- BUT I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE UNIQUE- IF A STRUCTURE THAT'S BEING AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE SEEN. SO FAR THIS CUP- CONTEMPLATED HERE- IT JUST OCCURRED IT IT AFTER HEARING ALL THE TESTIMONY. I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT BRILLIANT CORNERS IS DOING BECAUSE IT IS REALLY INNOVATIVE IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE ISSUE- AND THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE MORE HOUSING THAN PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS. IS I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYBODY SAY THAT SO FAR. I'M I'M ON THE HOUSING CALIFORNIA BOARD AND I'M PROBABLY IN BIG TROUBLE FOR. WE NEED TO BUILD A WHOLE LOT OF UNITS IT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND I I'VE BEEN A HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATE FOR THAT I WON'T TELL YOU HOW MANY YEARS BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU HOW OLD I AM BUT- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE VACANCIES I'M- WE HAD A PRESENTATION. THAT LED ME TO BELIEVE IN LA THAT. THAT WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOUSING BECAUSE OF THE RENT GETS INCREASED OR THEY LOSE THEIR JOB OR THEY GOT A MEDICAL BILL AND NOW THEY CAN'T PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING. THAT THOSE ARE THE ADDRESS IT THOSE ARE THE UNITS THAT PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE HOT HOMELESS ARE BEING PLACED IN SO THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RECYCLING PEOPLE. IN A WAY THAT WILL NEVER GET AS THE SITUATION AND SO. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO BUILD AND WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT WAY OF HOUSING PEOPLE AND I'M- I'M I'M INTEREST. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE AND THERE'S A SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS THAT WERE EVER GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS. SO IT IT JUST OCCURS TO ME THAT. THAT TAKING IT IN A MUCH MORE DELIBERATIVE PROCESS WHERE YOU HAVE YOUR MODEL. AND WE LOOK AT IT AND TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN TRAIN. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE STATE TO DO A VERY SIMILAR MODEL. IS GOING TO. BE MUCH MORE DELIBERATE HAVE AND WE CAN MAKE A LONGER TERM COMMITMENT TO IT. THAT WILL ALL HAVE THIS EELING LIKE WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING JUST FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WE SPENT. TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS AND WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING FOR IT AND SO ANY ANYWAY I THAT'S- I AM I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE- WHAT WE NEED IS THE HOPE THAT THERE IS. A PROCESS THAT WILL HELP US TO REDUCE THE HOMELESS. POPULATION AND THAT WE CAN THEN START DEALING WITH ALL THESE OTHER- AT DANGERS THAT ARE OUT THERE PEOPLE THAT ARE AT RISK OF BEING HOMELESS FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS I THINK YOU'VE FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU MANAGER. I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE CLASSY BIASES REYES AND SOMEBODY PUBLIC MEMBERS INTEND TO COMMENT OKAY IF YOU PLEASE QUEUE UP. OUR WE'RE GOING TO GIVE EVERYONE. ONE MINUTE I TO SEE HOW MANY FOR Q. AND A WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU- THE PALACE FOR PARTICIPATING MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST AT LEAST TO GROW IN THE AUDIENCE IN CASE.

THIS IMPORTANT HEARING OUT WHAT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AMONG ALL PEOPLE I'M HERE TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLKS SEEN OUR THINKING RESOURCES AND FUNDING ON ADDRESSING HOMES IS AMONGST YOUTH- HISTORICALLY THIS HAS NOT BEEN SOMETHING AT THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

I'M AND THIS IS A- IS WORKING KEEP WITH THE ISSUE TO WORK TALK THIS HER WE'VE- DODDSURVEYED AND INTERVIEWED CONTINUE CARE AND LARGE CITY IN THE BACK BILLION SAID TWICE THE AMOUNT MORE THAN TWICE THE AMOUNT ELEVEN PERCENT. VERSUS WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AS YOU SAID AT OUR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. AND TO CONSIDER ENHANCING THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLACEMENT FOR NON MINOR DEPENDENCE BUT HOUSING SUPPLEMENT SO THAT THE HOUSING CRISIS IS NOT ERODING THE SUPPORTIVE. BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING OUT THE FUNDING THAT CAN GO TO SUPPORT OF SERVICES AND EATING IT UP WITH HOUSING COSTS. AND YOUR PREVIOUS BILLS EIGHT SB SIX TWELVE ACTUALLY CALLED FOR WORK GROUP TO LOOK AT THE T. H. P. AND EMPTY RATE THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND UNANIMOUSLY IN APPROACH WAS SELECTED ANALYSIS HOUSING SUPPLEMENT APPROACH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING IS OFFERING A BILL IN THIS APPROACH AB EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY AND ALSO CHAMPION OF A BUDGET PROPOSAL TO DO THIS. THANK GOODNESS MINUTES AB SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THAT CHAU CALIFORNIA WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS HEARING AND THE FOCUS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION IS PLACING ON THIS ISSUE THE MISSING THAT WOULD KEEP IGNORING IS A LACK OF SUBSTANTIVE ON LONG TERM ONGOING INVESTMENT INTO COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES SAFETY NET WE CAN PLACE PEOPLE IN HOUSING BUT IF WE DON'T MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES BENEFITS THAT WILL KEEP THEM IN THEIR HOUSING AND THEM ON A PATHWAY TO SELF SUFFICIENCY AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS BY IN. THE NEED FOR OF ELLEN WORKERS SOCIAL WORKERS LIKE HEALTH NURSES ETCETERA EMPLOYMENT THIS IS PROFESSIONALS REALLY HAVING THEM OUT IN THE STREETS HAVING THEM OUT AT SCHOOLS HAVING OUT AT LIVE HOW NUMBER OR IS HAPPENING THAT SURE THE 75% OF THE POP. OF HOMELESS THAT IS NOT PROMPTLY HOMELESS THIS NEW UNLESS BECAUSE OUR POOL. ARE OVER THE AGE FIFTY.

GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S STATEMENT IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE THAT WE NEED AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE. TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND WE DO WE ARE FLOATING THE IDEA AND DONE SOME RESEARCH AROUND OF MILLIONAIRES TAX- WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LA PROPOSAL FOR TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON GOING- FUNDING- AND HAVING THAT FUNDING GOING TO EXISTING SYSTEMS RATHER THAN CREATING ANOTHER SILO- WE DO THINK THOSE EXISTING SYSTEMS OVER. THE LAST YEAR OF HOUSE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND SO WE BUILT ON THAT APPROACH TO MAKE IT MORE SUCCESSFUL. COACH ALSO. US SOME ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND BENCHMARKS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD NEED TO MAKE GIRLS THE FUNDING COULD GET OR ARE RE DIRECTED AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE MORE FEASIBLE WITH AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING- I JUST WANT TO TOUCH QUICKLY ON CAL AIM I'M WHILE I. APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ATTEMPT TO HAVE SOME FUNDING FOR HOUSING BASED SERVICES WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE OFFERED THROUGH A BENEFIT. THAT ALL HOMES PROGRAM IS A BENEFITS THE- CAL LAME IS PROPOSING ELIMINATING THAT PROGRAM. PLACING IT WITH- IN LIEU OF SERVICES WHICH IS NOT A BENEFIT AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY NATURE FOR. HEALTH PLANS TO OF OFFER A- THROUGH IT INTO THAT WILL GO AWAY SOON HERE- SO A AGAIN STRONGLY RECOMMENDS HAVING A BENEFIT THAT WOULD FUND HOUSING BASED SERVICES THROUGH MEDICARE. AND THAT COULD ATTRACT FEDERAL DOLLARS AND WE DO SUPPORT AT HOME A SET ASIDE AND WHATEVER PASSES- THROUGH OF YOU THROUGHOUT WEBER PASSES THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU NEXT WHAT.

ARM IN ARM. AND CARE MANAGEMENT REQUIRED HEALTH PLANS TO DEAL WITH GLOBAL OF CASE MANAGEMENT WITH POPULATION THAT THEY'RE AND FAMILIAR WITH- PARTICULARLY INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.
