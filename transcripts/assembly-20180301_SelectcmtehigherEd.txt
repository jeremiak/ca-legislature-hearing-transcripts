Along with my sister colleges in Clovis in Ridley. And that the other centers in this great state Senate communicative district. I which serves well over fifty five thousand students pursuing their educational goals it is my distinct pleasure to welcome each and everyone of you here today. As evidenced by today's agenda this informational hearing is designed to focus on ensuring the matter Ste master plan. Meets the needs of students. A special thank you to assemblyman Berman. Joaquin Arambula. And others and the other states a skewed other nurses and the first half but making sure the Savannah goes off without a hitch. I'd also like to think a a few of the notable dignitaries that are in the audience first and foremost as my boss Dr Pol Pot held chancellor of the great state Senate committee because district. Justine Deborah I cannot. My fellow sister and comrade in arms doctor Lori Bennett Clovis communicant. I know that we also a doctor Jones from Fresno Pacific university joining us thank you Sir for being here. Yes I have been to ran from the Central Valley higher and consortium joining us. And if I've missed anyone else my sincere apologies. Again. I know my one I think own I think all of the students. My local students and students who've traveled great distances to be with us today. I'm looking forward to hearing your voices on how we can ensure the California master plan may better meet the needs all students. An as a historian I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to talk just. For a second about how important stays to our future. By highlighting our past. The post World War two era has had significant. Impact on the reorganization of American higher education. Of the approximately seventeen states during the late nineteen fifties and sixties that modified their public and private systems to promote coordination. Control costs and insurance system that is built to educate the public. None. None that the massive work that California did. That work then resulted in a system that was the envy of the world. During the nineteen fifties California's. To find the common vision for higher education system. And at the opening of the negotiation process. Books have been read about that tense time. It was understood by all but the stakes were extremely high. For that university of California for the state's colleges and more importantly for the people and future of California. I would argue that today the stakes. Are even more I. Clark Kerr the president then of you see was a key figure in the development of the at California master plan. The plan set up a coherent system for post secondary education which to find the specific roles. Already existing university of California. But then California state college to system of senior colleges which we now know as the California State. University system and the California community college system. The plan referred. He keenly to curse vision and the role and the importance of higher education in the mid twenty century America. His insights in California's changing needs and aspirations with pivotal to the development. It's development an adaptation required both pragmatism and political skill. These three guys I know are listening to that last word who political skill. It's implementation propelled California her education to national and international prominence. However. As demographics. In the years wore on. The economic and educational circumstances in realities have changed over the year. Young man in the front can you hold up that device for second. Fuller pi. That wasn't around in the nineteen sixties. And a think about it much has changed in the nineteen sixties. So again I want to welcome all of you to Fresno City College. It is my hope that through the series of informational sessions we can embody the spirit that those held during those courageous conversations of the. And to be bold in our planning of our future. Is my hope that the work that takes place today and future sessions will continue to hasten the planting of the seeds of hope for our future. Our mutual trust. And and ordered Forest to be removed forward and created new shared vision how California will educate its people. I believe that everyone here on the panel and everyone in the audience and those who are watching online are committed to making sure that all of our sister is work together. To provide the best. For our students today. And for the students of our future. With the skills that they need to thrive in the twenty first century economy. That were living up to the promises that we made in the nineteen sixties the accessibility affordability and high quality will still remain. So ladies and gentlemen again thank you and welcome to Fresno City College. Thank you so much doctor goldsmith. I think you to your team here Fresno City College of for your hospitality and and for working with with my team. A to make today's. Committee hearing a success and I know it will be. And also thank you to everyone is joining us today of this is the third hearing of the assembly select committee on the master. For higher education in California. And the series being recorded and will be available for viewing online on the so select committee web page by as early as tomorrow. In nineteen sixty California developed a visionary plan for the future of higher education known as the master plan. However much has changed since nineteen sixty. Population growth increase student diversity a change in leading industries and their need for talent. As well as in the feel of education itself. Representing Silicon Valley I see how quickly technology is advancing along with the rise of new industry. Both have altered student needs and boost demand for higher education. We need a higher education system to respond to a host of issues never previously envisioned including the I thought. Or any smartphones. My goal for this select committee is to hold hearings throughout the state. To conduct a thorough legislative review to ensure that California has a master plan and higher edges education system for today and for tomorrow. We need to keep the state's promised to our students are providing and accessible affordable high quality higher education for all California students who qualify. The select committee is the first step in a multi year endeavor to update the master plan. Now I'm coming in with an open mind. And I do not have any preconceived notions or solutions that encourage my colleagues to do the same. I do the first two years of the select committee is being the information gathering phase where we hear from all stakeholders and collect as much feedback as we can. The select committee held its first hearing the last year on August thirty first in Sacramento where we heard in over view and status of higher education from the legislative analyst's office. As well as from the leaders of California's higher education institutions specifically the community colleges the CSU system the UC system and the association of nonprofit. Private institutions. The second hearing which was held on November first. I'd seen it they state university focused on California's workforce needs. At this hearing we heard from academics as well as the business community about the workforce skills gap never facing in California. In addition to today's hearing plan to hold two more hearings this year. One in southern California with a focus on the needs of faculty and staff. And one back in Sacramento to examine cost in funding issues including financial aid. After the conclusion of the hearings the slight committee was your report. Likely at the end of this year summarizing the hearings as well as recommending the next steps such as what issues need to be focused on in more depth. Today's hearing focusing on the needs of students will be student German. Now with the student kicking off each panel. Our hearing will consist of the following three panels. The first panel will discuss affordability and examine the total cost of attendance. For students. In this panel were hit we will hear from you see students. As well as from the institute for cops access and success. The second panel will discuss the basic needs of students such as food mental health and housing. And in this panel will hear from it CSU student as well as representatives from the public higher education segment. The third panel will discuss at the end student success. Out where we'll hear from a community college student a Fresno Pacific university student. The campaign for college opportunity and the Central Valley higher education consortium. And also be an opportune at the end for public comment. At the end of the hearing and with a sign up sheet for folks who like to speak and I think the Senate she is. Out the front door I'm really one encourage everybody who has something to say to to participate public comment. The subcommittee has a membership that's appointed on a bipartisan basis and we are very fortunate to have members who have a strong background in interest in higher education with us today. Up first and foremost is is our host. And your assembly member Dr Joaquin Arambula. And without a to have a look in my colleagues certainly don't during good. To say any anywhere is there. So I just wanted to say it's so nice. Back home in my backyard for those of you that don't now I grew up about a block away from. I live less than half a mile away from here right now and it really is nice being at the first City College in our state. And second in our nation. I'm particularly proud that my colleagues wanted to come in here are voices in our community. So often we feel that Sacramento doesn't hear us but here we are to hear from you. Finally like to say that not one of us who are here on the panel were around in the. Steve. And that as times change so must visions. And what our master plan must do is meet our needs of today. And so look forward to hearing from the students on how we can better make improvements and thank you again for being here at Fresno City. Thank you doctor England were also joined. By senator Ben Allen who is the chair of the Senate Education Committee. Senate Allen. We'll just. Grabbed just awarded to thank the organizers every helped put together obvious in. Drive down. It's really fun to. Your. To hear the pride that he. Is really spent. They were the top. So I really appreciate that you know I by I served as. Board member of the. A little while back. Ali with the growth me witnesses. The growth of. Saddest the road I will surely proud of the sick is that have place there but we're also. Proud of and also. Concerned about in the broader. A chap is a needs that are that are entire public educate. The faces you for you and I'm just glad that they assignor Berman is really taking on this issue the very substantive way. Updating examining our master plan that was written in nineteen sixty units will serve the state so well. Over so many years and yet there's no question everybody's mind that. It deserves a a liver of an upgrade. And that's what we're doing with the subcommittee. Typically we you know we have a strange inner house rivalry that I never quite understand and Sacramento but I wanted to make sure that as chair. Of the committee that oversees education policy on the Senate side that I be that participate in this effort and that's why I'm here today and. And. And excited to hear about. The stories would be proud for to our committee today. I will be focusing a lot portability questions an enormous problem statewide. How young people are being asked to step up and leverage their futures and it to levels that I think previous generations never could have imagined? And then exacerbating the cost that we're putting on to the the basic cost of education. We don't have all the enormous housing costs that. Have just gone through the roof everywhere in the state. And it's really becoming enormous challenge the wild thing is that now it ends up that the total cost of education. Is actually tends to be higher for a a. A low income communicable student who doesn't live at home. Verses you see your cal state is because the least do you see. They've got you know. Decent wraparound services. No for room and board for low income students and that of course doesn't exist. Not in any kind of robust waiter could be college level so we're we're all facing enormous challenges right now as we try to think about how to move forward. But I I really do applied. A marketing Joaquin for their leadership and I'm I'm looking for to hearing the testimony today. Thank you very much senator and and thank you for your involvement it's gonna make you as we move from information gathering stage to that. The legislative stages that. In a joint and and close relationship that we have I think it's gonna make a lot smoother. On in both houses really appreciate you taking your whole day pretty much out to come and spend with us. Is a direct flight to LA them to catch leader. And and so our first panel. Is our do we have a list of. Perfect and so I think we think the local elected leaders have been introduced if anybody was introduced earlier please let us know. When it will be happy to recognize you during the hearing. Then so we'll move on our first panel which is on affordability. The total cost of attendance for students. And select introduced Spenser Brandt who's a student leader at UC Santa Barbara. And W. W. Cochran and vice president of the institute for college access its success thank you so much for joining us. It will kick it off for the presentation from from Spencer. Good afternoon. Leyva Spencer brand and I am a third year student at UC Santa Barbara I had the privilege of being here representing the UC student association. System wide advocacy group with a strong history of campus activism and education policy advocates he forty two hundred thousand plus undergraduate. Graduate and professional you see students. It feels good to be here and Fresno because it feels like home to me too I grew up in the Central Valley as did my parents. And their parents before them. I'm cognizant that here in the Central Valley we lag significantly behind the rest of the state in terms of higher education. Only thirteen percent of adults in my home county have acquired a bachelor's degree. My family is reflective of that number. Throughout my childhood and teenage years I can remember my mother always telling me that she couldn't wait until I went away to college. Whether that was because she saw potential in me or because she saw an XTC major who she wanted to get out of the house. I can't be completely sure. But more particularly my mother always stressed to me that the cost of college shouldn't prevent me from pursuing higher degree. The degree the skills you learn are worth it she would tell me. Occasionally this message came across as the typical modeler motherly encouragement. And other times I could hear in her voice that she was trying to tell me something else. Something about her own journey through life that she regretted. Something about the inaccessibility of college when she was growing up. In the financial structure it struggles that had limited her options. Despite those odds he had acquired a degree so I took her advice and applied to the schools of my dreams. All in the California you perceive California and CSU system. I was admitted to UC Santa Barbara and quickly decided to attend what was and is still the most beautiful campus in the world. Upon enrolling at UCSB I quickly learned that the cost of college for students are not confined to the classroom. The cost of college includes includes books force readers and lab coats housing Hafen in saturated markets with perpetually rising rents. And food and other basic needs needed to survive. Another thing I like for my mom a kid twelve teacher for more than a decade is that academic success does not begin and and in the classroom. It extends to every students home environment. I have to make tough decisions about whether to buy every book that I need for a course. Or to go to the market in by angry ins for dinner. I satellite you're wondering what it is that I can do to come up with those extra few dollars to pay rent. I maxed out on the amount student loans I can half. I can tell you the names of every financial assistance program that we have on campus which ones are grants which ones are loans. Which ones require proof of an addiction notice before they stepped in with meager systems. Because I've been searching for every possible Avenue to pay for these costs. I can also tell you that I know that financial support that students receive is going to get smaller before it gets bigger. This is because our segments of higher education in the state are only two pieces in the web of assistance that is provided to students. At the federal level student aid grant programs have been decimated. In nineteen eighty the be all grant covered seventy seven percent of the cost of college attendance. Today it covers less than one third of that cost. Hell is no longer tied to inflation and uncertainty and neglect at the federal level threatens to impose further financial hardship on students. In addition increased enrollments have impacted the housing markets is for campuses across the state. My first year I lived in the chapel room on campus in a dorm that was constructed around the time that my grandfather was born. Older friends of mine who had lived in the same dorm were shocked that room was a closet with two people living in it how do you manage they would say. Needless to say we were eager to move out after the first year of close company. This year the last freshman doubles were converted triples on our campus to accommodate rising enrollment. My roommates and I decided to move out of the residence halls in in Thailand is set a college town directly adjacent to you see center Barbara. With costs were extensively lower. We begin searching for housing coming academic year during December of our first year school. We quickly quickly realize that the only way to find something halfway affordable was to find some friends who were going to pack into an apartment like sardines. We settled on a group of six men six turned to eight and eight to ten. Are leasing camp company paid us no deference and we stop the unit that we've been eyeing to another group of students so we added the final two people Bataan and signed a lease on the bottom story of a duplex. For a grand total of six thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars per month. Well above the cost estimates posts on the UC website. My parents agreed to split the security deposit my share was fifteen hundred dollars in total. Will get about all back I sure them but my friends and I knew that I was the landlords are notorious for getting away with highway robbery. Talking thousands and falsely claim damages every year. Today as far as our land lord knows we've E. people living in our little blue house. But in reality anywhere from ten to thirteen people are crammed into two bedrooms and one garage on any given night. Some who are additional sub Weezer's somewhere France some more friends that are experiencing homelessness. This student aid I receive this year through cal grant a direct federal loans comes to hundred fifty dollars short of covering the cost of my rent each quarter. Needless to say. When I'm not studying I work to make up the difference. While the home environment can he cramped loud and overwhelming sometime at least I can say that I live with some good for. Not all students can say that. Kind of firemen can take a toll on our students academic performance. Cal grant and loans don't cover the cost of basic needs either. As a freshman with the meal plan I paid almost two thousand a quarter for nutritious and. Paid for by special grant given to first year students. No but I live off campus I can't afford be paying ten dollars per meal so I cook for myself as often as I can. And buy food and other basic necessities at the market down the street. The prices they're unfortunately are well above the state average. Cal grant does not cover my costs of living or my cost of education during the summer months as well even though my lease last year round. Because of the difficulty I have getting into courses I needed began content I need to begin and continue my major. I pursue taking classes over the summer. I can't do this at UC Santa Barbara because cal grant does not extend into the summer. This leaves in a time crunch to take out. As many courses is I can't of finish my degree in four years. Before my financial aid runs out. I had no idea about any of this before I step foot on campus. And parents the trial by fire that students know all too well. We need a more accurate and transparent assessment of these costs so that they can make some students can make the right financial decisions. Lastly the sleeves of books quirk breeders and other educational supplies as a third consistently under prioritize because. I and other specter the price of which are rising faster than housing or tuition and fees. These are the true cost of attendance. They go far beyond tuition and fees students are engaged in the constant balancing act weighing their academic attainment against some of their basic needs. In past hearings held by this committee we've heard about the importance of making the university accessible to all California students. Especially those that are from underrepresented communities including people of color undocumented students students for rural communities and students with disabilities. If our state wants to claim the mantle of standing for these communities and for a vision of opportunity and social justice. This is imperative and if our state wants to meet the needs of California's a vibrant economy we must increase the number of students with degrees and close the degree gap. But we do this by investment first and foremost the California public higher education system clearly lacks the resources. To accomplish the major task given rolling born more students without a major shift in tone on the part of our lawmakers an executive branch in regard to funding. If your has its in to believe me take a look. At the state of our campuses right now. Come visit our classrooms and sit with students in the aisles of lecture halls. Come. Sorry visit our research labs and talk to our researchers who work with aging and dilapidated equipment. Caller counseling and psychological services center and try to schedule an appointment. I can promise you'll wait anywhere between a day and week to see a therapist and once you do follow up visits are scheduled weeks away if at all. Now imagine that these institutions have been rolled thousands and thousands of more students without adequate reinvestment. And try to tell me that they are still the number one public higher education system in the world. We must collectively reimagine the role of higher education in our state. I believe every resident must have the right to attend college without that without tuition and without an unbearable cost of living. Students on our campus have high hopes in our collective ability to produce that long term vision for public higher education in our state. Through it all we must look at the student experiences our Guiding Light. Must raise per student funding in all segments of higher education. Lower the cost of attendance for students and we must work together by students workers as faculty as colleges and is policymakers to make this vision a reality. I can promise you that students are ready to do their part. Thank you. Thank you very much Spencer Spencer and and some of his peers. Came to my office. A month month and a half ago. To talk with me about their experiences. You see S. B. in and how they really want to be. Constructive part of this conversation and and the patient a day as a huge step in that direction really appreciate that. The very much and next up we have Debbie Cochran vice president of the institute for college access and success Phone. And thank you so much for having me here today I am so happy to be here with you I'm. The institute for college access and success is a non prop up it nonpartisan research and policy organization based in. Oakland California. I'm organizations vice presidents and I also lead it's California policy in advocacy work. I said I would acknowledge right now that I'm gonna go through some of these lights pretty quickly I actually pulled the power point together before writing up what I was going to say about it you realize I might. Been a little too ambitious. So. Bear with me. Are you know I really appreciate this could this committee's focus on. Making sure that the master plan is meeting the needs of students and starting off with affordability in particular because we at TI guess he affordability. I'm as very critical to both students access to and success in college. You know if you can't pay the tuition bill for college then you can't access college you can't step foot in the door. But text books transportation food housing those are all also costs of attendance for college if you only have resources to cover the tuition melon not those other costs. You can't afford to keep coming back to the classroom day after day and week after week you can't afford to visit the library or visit the tutoring center or good a professor's office hours. So those are the types of costs in this are the types of financial aid that students need. See it in college. I'm as a state when we look at the research in the and that. Day how California compares to the rest the country we see that California's on a relatively good job with making access to college affordable. Ya in California young adults are much more likely to enroll in college than their peers nationally. Our community colleges have the lowest tuition in the country and that all of California's public colleges and universities about half of students attend tuition free. And that's really because we as a state have long set up our financially policies to make sure that tuition costs aren't a barrier to enrolling. But the state does not do as good of a job with supporting students with non tuition costs. The California SUNY commission estimates that for twenty thousand seventeen eighteen. Full time student living independently off campus that's that's the way that most college students in California at all three segments lives. They have on over nineteen thousand dollars and cost beyond tuition so you can see the breakdown on the slide of how those costs shake out of. Over nine thousand dollars in the colleges and estimates for housing costs as we just heard those caught those estimates might even be realistic. And now my next two slides are focused on three public colleges in the Sacramento area and the demonstrate how much of it. To look at total college costs I'm as opposed to just tuition. So we look at just tuition costs. We can see that the community college is by far the least expensive option of that of the three choices that a Sacramento areas you might be faced with. I am in fact the cost of community college that's quite low. But when we add in non tuition costs the differences shrink and the entire total costs of attendance for students at all three segments. But much harder at for students to reach. Now these are colleges own estimates of students costs and we took them from colleges net price calculators. I am now the net price of colleges when it cost students to actually attend college. Full cost of college after taking out all the grantee that's available to students I'm sorts when they really need to pay after granted no net price calculators are consumer tools that are designed. To help prospective students and their families understand what is really going tap it costs for a student to attend a particular college. So we looked at the net price calculators for twenty seven public colleges. State. All nine of the undergraduate serving UC's and nearby see. Cao states and community college campuses because we wanted to see what it costs for low income students to attend each of these schools. Now we focused on low income students by which I mean with family incomes under thirty thousand dollars of having come here because analyses of college affordability across in. Groups consistently shows that this is the group that is facing the most burdensome college costs. It's also important to note however that the majority of African American Latino and give American students have family incomes under thirty thousand dollars. So looking at net price calculator as we can see. And review how well you can see that on that on the screen you can see that our sample students that we that we looked at that price calculators for would receive more than enough granted to cover their tuition at each of the. Colleges but they're still left with net prices that would require them to borrow loans or work long hours to afford. As senator Alan put it so well in his introductory remarks I'm in most regions of the state including here and the Central Valley this community colleges actually be most expensive option. For students. Now in twenty sixteen we surveyed twelve thousand California community college students about the trade offs that they face in pain for college. And the overwhelmingly discuss the challenges posed by their non tuition costs. Many students shared stories about their struggles with homelessness or near homelessness and pointed out specifically how little financial aid is available to help students with those costs. Students shared stories about having to choose between buying textbooks and eating. Many students I have pointed to the cost of textbooks as being unrealistically high such as two hundred dollars with one student even. Asking very directly how is a low income students supposed to afford this. It was part of this same study we ask students what they are likely to do you if they cannot afford required text. One third of them said that they would do what they could to pass our forces without the books. Twenty seven percent said they were likely to drop the course. So this exemplifies how students when faced with on affordable college costs make choices that influence whether the graduate. In what amount of time and at what cost. The can borrow student loans which hopefully will be able to pay off once they graduate. They can work the research shows that working more than fifteen or twenty hours a week while they're a full time student is detrimental to their success. Or they can come back on enrollment which puts them at greater risk of not completing. So when I touch very briefly on each of those issues. In a joint effort with a cow seats you disassociation we recently found that the vast majority of CSU graduates with student loan debt. Came from families with incomes of no greater than fifty four thousand dollars of income. Nearly two thirds came from families with incomes less than twenty fab seven thousand dollars. Public data from the university of California show very similar trends. About half of all bachelors degree graduates with debt from the UC had family incomes less than fifty five thousand dollars in the lowest income students were three times as likely to leave with that as the highest income students. So this is a critically important trend for us to understand as we look towards state policy solutions. That to ensure that a college education is affordable. Students also worked to cover college costs I met all twenty seven of the colleges that you just on that map of California. The lowest income students would have to work more than twenty hours a week to cover those costs. At some colleges in all three of the segments they would have to work more than thirty hours a week this is already went once you've taken into account the grantee that the billable. So needing to spend this much time working means less time studying. No more than any other single topic that came up in our survey of students students share how these trade offs for their time were holding them back academically. Moving forward to ensure that the master plans promise of educational opportunities realized we need more and better and. It's in the basement Julie. We need at to bribe better recognize and address the total costs of college that students are facing. And we must ensure that financial aid investments are targeted at the students for whom college costs are the most burdensome and for whom. Barriers to enrollment completion are most pronounced. Currently the cal grant program does that provide some support for students for non tuition. But hundreds of thousands of eligible students every year are turned away from the program because enough grants available. A recent high school graduates who apply for a cal grant me the deadline that they're entitled to a grants. But if you're not a recent high school graduate give to compete in the most recent year see sacrifice that over four hundred thousand students competed for less than twenty six thousand grants. Most of the students who are turned away without a grant have income so low that the federal government estimates they cannot afford to put a single dollar towards our college. Tions. Never the applicants who do receive a grant the portion of the cal grants that covers non tuition costs has not kept pace. It's lost most of its purchasing power you have the award kept pace with inflation. It today would be over worth over six thousand five hundred dollars. Instead. The maximum award is one thousand six hundred seventy two. Now in recent years the legislature has created two new financial aid programs to increase this award for full time community college students in particular in this is very important progress in the right direction. It is also very important understand that only four percent of California community college students receive the cal grant upon which these out on grants are based. So it's important games Gaines for a very small group of students. So I'd like to close some by sharing finance from one more report that's relevant today to today's conversation. We recently interviewed twenty two expert throughout the state about their own perceptions of the strains in challenges related to college affordability throughout how. Among these experts there is resounding consensus that California has a college affordability problem. In all interviewees agreed that improving college affordability means focusing on covering non tuition costs students. Many also expressed the importance of doing more for the neediest students including nontraditional students under service use community college students former foster youth and other first generation students. Experts also recently are also it universally agreed that affordability challenges negatively impact students in several ways. While student debt burdens rose to the top meaning. On affordable college means more Sudan I'm almost equally concerning to the experts were the impacts of affordability challenges on students enrollment in college their ability to get to college or through college in a timely way. In of course that it contributed to equity gaps that we see in college access and completion. So within our current state financial aid structure the simplest way to make targeted investments to address these challenges is to increase the number of cal grants available. In increase the size of the grants available to students for non tuition costs. But the experts we with whom we spoke also underscored the need for broader systemic reform. That we need to also reduce the complexity of the financial aid system we need to correct outdated assumptions about who today's students really are. The legislative analyst's office put out a proposal for financially reform last year. The California's you nay commission is considering reform options as we speak so these are enormously important conversations and we need to get it rights. AB implementing reforms will work I will require both political leadership and additional investments but the extent of the consensus around the problem and its implications. Underscore the costs of inaction thank you. Thank you thank you so much W. and I first of the chance to me W. at a higher education conference so in California. And. But you had a slight three here really stuck with me. And I've been repeating it in Frawley bungling it. When I've repeated the. For the last couple months which is eight for tuition facilitates access. But eight for non tuition costs facilitates college success. And and we're good is it if we're setting students up to to fail essentially what we're letting them in but we're not giving them. What they need? And the financial assistance that they need so that they can really focus on their studies. And and be able to see it and so I really love the way that that was freezing really appreciate that I won open of my colleagues first doctor Arambula. Africa come visit you. So I just wanted to recognize two of the state's center community college district trustees who are here Miguel audio Susan back as well as. John the Allen just wanted to thank you guys for being. Thank you very much. Senate Allen Jimmy Y. disaffected just part of part of the on the cal grant numbers you disparate raised miss Crocker and if you were talking about how. And can we four percent of all students get the. The cal grant be is it is. Could use her flesh that out a bit I mean I it. Presumably. You're. Keep his fuss about holiday because I. Recent budget things in my mind. You. Have so. So about four percent of California community college. They seek help. Right arm what book but. But but it's a chilly much higher percentage get some form of financial aid. Yes about forty five percent of students get the fee waiver will we look at full time student assembly almost seventy or eighty percent of students get a fee waiver. And we get a federal help. For the cal grant program is not not closely aligned with the community college who. Students who are. Going to community colleges are off and I'm take they have a gap between high school enrollments. College and college or if they do go directly from high school to college if often missed the window maybe they didn't they were not. College preparation for. Right. So as part of your idea that we ought to expand the. Rules of eligibility. For the government be. Think I think we need to you know we need to insure that more of the four hundred thousand applicants who are applying. Not these recent. It's have an opportunity. On Thursday been different legislative proposals for how to that in recent years one is just simply to increase the number of grants available. Another option would be to expand the entitlement. For all college grads are all high school graduates are to. To the few different ways to go but the important thing is that we go one of those ways. And if it would you find what it is that being the. Close is equivalent to the cal grant be. For those students who are coming into the cocky because system a little later. What would it would their major sources of financial aid typically for not eligible for the? Government be. Almost all as well the three major sources of financial aid the the three largest sources of financially for California community college students. Are the federal Pell grants the the fee waiver now known as the promised. And federal student loans very few community college students actually borrow federal student loans but there is more aid that goes to students through the federal student loan program. Them through the Calgary. And that the. The fee waivers the Bob. Waiver of heather okay. Great okay thank you. Thank you and I think that's a good point you know. Caspian to this whole effort which back in nineteen sixty the vast majority of our students were students coming straight out of high school. And and today in two thousand eighteen with so many more students that are. You know it worked for a couple years and I than China. A teen degree or. You know start a family in are coming back now that their. Family situations more stable whatever it is where the holes that would set up don't apply to them. Then then so trying to find more creative ways. To make sure that we're providing. Financial aid and and support the today's students as opposed to the students of sixty years ago. Is gonna be a really important conversation that we have. So one quick question that I have. Maybe for Spencer you or I their view is yes but from what you've experienced so you seen. What? Can you may talk about a specific limitations of student aid in covering some of the students non tuition costs. I think that you can run into if any. Yeah sure well. The the first thing of course is that when you have. The pool of student navy your granted from these various source says. The first thing it goes to cover ease your tuition and fees at university of course. Then as a student my user experience on this is that I get sent the track or a check or a direct deposit. In its for whatever the differences. So in between that night sort of mention this my. Having maxed out on the amount of direct federal loans that I can which Roth. And. That amount that I was awarded time cal grant. Dot still comes up short. Even covering the three months rent reporter that I would have to pay. So obviously that's your biggest limitation it's that it's not. Meeting the needs um no a of students who are. I finding themselves in in housing markets like this that. How I've server patchily rising rents? But of course. On talk about you know that leaves no money for. Your basic needs costs that's food. Are you know basic toiletries. It's your books. Your equipment that you have to buy. For you loud. On your course readers. And. I think it's I I really want to put a. In in what you said about. The fact that something around which to tweak combined those two segments of students are that would either drop the class or try to get by in the class without going it buying book. That's a real the suit decision that students make it certainly decision that I've made I usually err on the side of just hoping I can skate by and everything worked out. But it does hinder my success of course so. These things are all interconnected. Excellent since the dispenser. NNW you've got or slide this is our but the slide of the state that shows. Your college costs are for low income students across California and. In the research that you've done. Where's my question is that I want to ask. Though he'd dot do not tuition costs of college. Del you seem to the very across region of me are or something Tyrone one region and lessen another in. May is that should be taken some flexibility into account when we're designing the programs. Do you think. I know that's a very it's a very interesting question I think actually gets back in some ways to Spencer's through Spenser's points around. Cost estimates. Whom he seemed we do this research is often that it doesn't vary as much as you think I'm the California sea nay commission has for many years now put out. Annual estimates of what the non tuition because college are so each college has supporting their at a student budget an estimate of what it. They can either tuition to that and then very there you have your budget. But it's a statewide estimates most community colleges in the state of California use that state. So that means Fresno City College probably shows the same housing that's. As separate. IBM's college. It's it's hard to imagine housing costs are the same and those two regions but at the same time. Pulling together. You know their own esta. Can be time consuming. Administratively. So I think issue nay commission's efforts that there did working on right now to get a better handle on what's. Actually are and how they might the varying across across in California incredibly import. Perfect thank you. And I have a couple dozen other questions I'd like ask bring that same for the next two panels. So really one I think. Spencer and Daddy for all your comments today thank you very much. And so and it's been is going to be the basic needs of students food of mental health and housing. And and before I introduce the panelists yeah earlier late last year I was reading. Occasions a we have a assembly fellows program in the state assembly where people were coming straight out of college can apply for when your fellowship. In the state legislature and I was reading through these resumes and then these applications of incredibly impressive students and I was shocked. By how many students mentioned that they started a food pantry on campus. And and the fact that. We have a need for that many food pantries on our public. Hire. Education campuses in California including I hear one here Fresno City College. And so our next panel is going to be on basic needs of students food of mental health and housing. And I want to first introduce Maggie white who the student at CSU Stanislaus medi. Kim go on no whose of the university of California basic needs co chair A. you see senators think him. Doctor Denise Beverly director of student wrongness and basic needs initiative at California State University office of the chancellor. And Colleen Ganley Thurmond. Program specialist at the California community college chancellor's office thank you all so much for participating today. And will kick off with Maggie. Hi everybody good afternoon I feel so privileged to be here with you today my name is Maggie Y. Democrat it's dean accents last. And the president of the cal state student association representing nearly half million CSU students from Humboldt San Diego. And I gotta say like that fantastic speaker from you see who is just out here I was also born and raised the valley just couple hours of nineteen ninety Modesto. And you know I've been separate what my position is present on to travel all over the state meeting wonderful people. But Valley people are always my favorites I am very happy to be here. I feel very safe I can say that I hear a lot about the people around me. Separate the Friday before I jump to my comment disliked thank everyone here. For the day that the divers work that you're doing to support public higher education in California and all of your different capacities whether to the legislature on the university campus. It truly the work that you do have an effect on our on our students and all systems I'm so glad to be working on this idea of. I'm here today to address on the topic of basic needs in higher education. But right into when I'm seeing as a student leader and cal state that Sam. I want to acknowledge that these issues are not unique to anyone system. The needs of students to identify affordable housing into remain house throughout college. To feed ourselves on a day to day basis. And to at least attempt to take care mental health during the rigors of our educate Dan. Unfortunately not unique justice Stevens I represent in the CSU system. And my position I had the great privilege of working alongside student leaders from all corners of the state. And the stories I hear on a regular basis connected to basic needs a truly heartbreaking. I'd like to briefly touch on the topic of privilege. There is a great privilege and being able to attend college. And my case even work towards a masters degree something that I never imagined and I was a senior in college and talking to advise and I never been something that. Was painted is that they can be part of my life. We know of the many benefits of that privilege. Opportunities for upward social mobility. Access to jobs in industry in this great state. That privilege of just be able to pull yourself out a life of poverty during own hard work and determination. This privilege is a great thing but I think that this narrative has in some ways. Hidden disappears troubles of our students. I state leaders you almost often care the struggle that your constituents based on a regular basis. People who are chronically homeless people who are sick and disabled struggling to pay their extremely expensive hospital bills. Single parent struggling to work and take care for young children. School teachers working in challenging classrooms not being paid are supported enough. These challenges are overwhelming to the individuals into the state. And sometimes I'm sure it may seem that the struggles of a college student I'm not as great as those other concerns. However while there is great privilege and healing a college degree. The path to get there can be as challenging as any. And if the student lacks access to their basic needs. Food housing mental health resources they have a larger likely had of struggling in college dropping out before completion and leaving the institution with that but no degree. With that being said I'd like to break these issue at. And address them one at a time. But there's that student security be heard for years about the struggle that students sometimes space to feed themselves. A few years ago this issue became such a priority that we began to see both a suit associated students organizations on campus since. And even campus leadership like that Fresno state. Begin to address these issues by opening food pantries on campus. Since then many different tactics have begun to utilize on our campuses in the CSU. And you get to hear about many of them I am Sir at from doctor needs badly at the director of student while this the basic needs initiative as well as other representatives from the systems. Just a few weeks ago the CSU released their system my basic needs are part and the findings were very Graham. It was reported that nearly two hundred thousand CSU students face some form of food insecurity. Those numbers are staggering. I think the assumption is that the college experience should be a struggle. Everyone struggles in college so I to this generation be any different are we just too soft. We just can't handle it. I like to think that the struggle we reference ought to be. Connected academic records of the program. That mental and emotional development that occurs when you sit in a classroom surrounded by diverge Spock an opinion on the subject. Not whether or not someone's able to access officially nutritious food to get themselves through the day. The impacts of the issue thirds insecurity should be obvious. But also should not go without saying. Students have trouble feeding themselves apart having more trouble in class. This prayer is critical because system wide and statewide there continues to be a per she it seems that finish line of graduation even more quickly. And while great work is being done to achieve this goal higher graduation rates. If we're not addressing our students basic needs the issue of food insecurity is obviously widespread. But it cuts differently among different student groups. Los systemwide forty one point six percent and CSU students report some form of food insecurity. Forty one point six percent across the system. Sixty five point nine percent of black first generation college students reported food insecurity. I'll say it again almost seventy percent. A black first generation students in the CSU based and security. Among our students are classified as underserved. Their rates of food insecurity or mean higher than the average. This means that as we continue to address this issue. The work must be done intentionally and with the state's dedication to equity at the forefront. And the to homelessness unfortunately CSU students have not remained unscathed. From this state right affordable housing crisis. Before getting into what we know about the CS use how much students I want to tell a brief story. Last week very close to here Fresno state. CSA along with assembly members coming era and Arambula. Unveiled AB twenty seven eighty four. At delta pilot program to address student homelessness. For the president we want what's Fresno state student leaders to identify students what experience homelessness. To speak in support at the press conference. There student leaders tried for weeks to find someone willing to speak about their experiences at public events. It became close multiple times with multiple students identified as homeless. But no student out of many identified were willing to come forward and tell their story. The stigma of homelessness remains strong. And is no different for our students. And fortunately far too many of our CSU students do experience homelessness. Ten point nine percent of students system wide but fifty two thousand students in the CSU. Reported being homeless sometime within the last year. And again our African American first generation students reported higher than average numbers and eighteen percent. I probably don't have to tell you that when you're homeless. Turning in that paper on time. Attending class or office hours and participating in high impact practices and programs is probably the very last thing on your mind. The issue of homelessness in general and student homelessness specifically. Remains such a challenging issue debate because they're so feel low cost solutions. Well with food and security meeting the number of advancements from partnerships with county food banks to donations from community members to bring students to calabash benefits. Those types of low cost options don't really exist when it comes to providing a safe and stable home environment. Campus housing is not really a solution from a students. Because on many campuses the prices near the local cost of housing or may even be higher. And in most cases there are not many vacancies in campus housing to serve best into the up homeless throughout the semester. With few campus based solutions available aye how much students joined countless number and other people who are homeless in this state. Praying for additional solutions and resources to solve this issue. I do want to mention that we have seen many campuses sat at struggling with homelessness. Many campuses have created small amounts of emergency short term housing to help shelter our neediest students. But for many reasons this is merely a bandaid. A good bandaid but a bandaid nonetheless. While we know that many college age youth who are homeless seek shelter for safety. And emergency short term housing solutions off our students at least that temporary safety. They're not proven methods to keep that image was permanently housed. This takes us time last issue of the portion mental health. All of these issues seem to relate to one another. After all they're having trouble finding housing it probably also struggling to feed yourself. And it experiencing homelessness and our food insecurity you're totally have troubles with your mental health as you deal with that daily trauma. Of course there are other factors that contribute to mental health challenges to. They. Of the college studies. Their immigration status and the national climate. And the personal issues with family friends romantic partners. These factors are all linked and layered. In addition cultural stigmas make it a challenge to even come forward. When one has a mental health issue. I've heard from CSU students at southeast Asian background for example who carries significant cultural stickman. In seeking help with respect their mental health. This type of statement only compounds the issue of mental health for the students. And other to explain similar issues in their communities and households. Stands up front tired for the past two years to try to expand mental health resources on campuses but unfortunately we have not been successful enough. We know that the national standard for mental health counselors on the college campus is one mental health counselor per fifteen hundred students. However only thirteen ever twenty three campuses have anything close to one hundred that range. At some campuses the radio is much higher. At Fresno state San Francisco saying how stay LA. The ratio is one counselor to more than three thousand students. These ratios mean on many campuses to deal with a lack of mental health counselors students report wait times up to a month. To see a counselor in person. There's often a cap on their visits throughout the year. That means that if I go and I put my name on the list they call me in three or four weeks I go see a counselor. And I make a connection with this person I finally filled I can open up and speak about my difficulties. That person have returned to me and say I'm sorry I can only see you six more times this year. And I care for you to an outside clinic. If you can get the transportation to get there never insurance covers it. That's unacceptable. No student when they have found the courage to come forward. And acknowledge their mental health issues. Should have to wait so long. About a lack of access the help that they need to be safe and successful on their campus. Lastly on this topic on our campuses student fees are being used to pay for these mental health resources. This means that the most obvious way to expand these needed resources on campus is to increase the if campus based feels. But this only compounds the cycle of affordability in mental health challenges. Students are struggling with food costs housing costs. And rising tuition and fees. If the only solution with respect mental health is to exacerbate another issue that is not an acceptable solution. I want to thank all of you for allowing me to speak to you today on this critical issue is. I also want to thank the other senior representatives who are here. Speaking today on the issues of equity in student success on the total cost of attendance. All these issues are intertwined and I feel so privileged to work alongside you to represent all California college students and trying to solve these issues. In partnership with our ski institutional leaders think you very much. Thank you very much Maggie and. Nagy mentioned that you know maybe it's. We just this younger generation that's soft and can't presume Maggie that you were born. In nineteen ninety eight or before. Alright so Maggie and I are both members of the same generation both members of the millennial generation. We've created millennial caucus in the state legislature. And for fear of offending most the people in here of. For the men on for the millennial generation and and the current generation of college of of undergrad students I'm forgetting the name of to its current generation what recovery because all. Generation social media that's we're gonna going. I know what is it. Senate generation Z. it it is hard to get into college it's harder to graduate in four five years aye costs more to attend. And and graduates are graduating with more student debt. Than ever before. And so I I I die I can't you put incredibly eloquently. Really appreciate you doing that. Before we Bonta ten the alkaline no I just want to. Introduce my my colleague and friend Jose Medina. Summer Medina is chair of the assembly. Higher Education Committee and is been working with me on the the master plan. The select committee on the master plan for higher education when I first approach Mr Medina about this I said the I'll I'm interested in compromising the master plan that if it takes. I just got elected if it takes ten or twelve years that's how long it's gonna take. A and Mr Medina said I turn out in eight years let's do a before that. So is so we've. You know. I'd spend of the time frame a little bit but missed Medina one to give you a chance you once introductory comments or. Perfect. Thought like introduced him Delano Tim is. The university of California basic needs co chair at UC Santa Cruz attempt by. Afternoon everyone. Yeah I'm the upper the generation of technology that I'm working on a. The open. Because there. Using a map to the PC world as. His new an ambitious. But okay. So thank you selectivity members an attendee is. It's an honor to participate in this timely panel on hearing assuring that the California higher education master plan meets the needs of students across the state. Both two year and four year public and private. I have my brief remarks will contribute to your understanding of the basic needs challenges facing students today. As well as what we're doing across the university of California and our partners to advance solutions. So I myself have a communicable as graduate I get CD UC Santa Cruz I return to school after a few years works thirty eight hours and. No the Santa Barbara cue muted thirty miles to school so I I get a sense of this and really appreciate this work and I'm in it for the long haul homeless when it as well as many of us that go through our public education system. So I just want extend that eight dollars to the university of California at self as I begin to really look at it as a system I mean a comprises over two hundred thirty thousand students. A hundred fifty academic disciplines six hundred graduate degree programs a ten campuses serving undergraduates graduate and professional students. So has being data basic needs we have to think about those three student populations and how we're developing and responding to of all of their needs. So a clear challenge in higher education today is the impact the cost of attendance we've heard that from Spencer and Debbie. As well so today's expenses are other than tuition they count for more than sixty percent of the total cost of attending a college and university. And over the last four decades the cost of living for college students has increased by over eighty percent. Peter I next senior research economist of the federal reserve best summed up the struggle for students. In relation to the number of hours they need to work to cover the cost of attendance. So thirty five hours a week you know compared is a few decades ago is factored in that you can succeed as a student and work ten hours. So we need to account for that and think about how we're being responsive to that change in trend in it's alarming implications. So that means older generations regular pay for much more than lentils. As past wages now today cover only one third of the cost of attendance. Further the institute because success in. That access is S. T. guests. I noted in their work because because for low income Californians that it would take up to thirty seven hours a week at the high end for students. To cover the cost of attendance at the receive no financial aid and had to cover all their expenses by working. So the increased cost of attendance do affect student and food and housing security. Cordon the USDA food security is measured by identifying food secure. Low in very low food security. So low food security is a factor of equality in very low's a factor of quantities who just to break that down for folks. And food insecurity itself. Is defined as a limited on certain availability. Actually adequate and see foods with the ability to acquire such foods in a socially acceptable manner. So the question sets in the U. S. D. designed to assess. The validity of food security are eighteen tener six item question sets that are used nationally. So to start with understanding family food security through census data we find that families across the U. S.. On average are suffering fourteen percent low in very low food insecurity combined. Soon look at studies in higher education the results are noticeably. More significant. So between two thousand nine and two thousand sixteen there a total of nine studies in the problems of food insecurity in college campuses. With an average food insecurity of loan very low totaling forty eight percent. So there's a signal right there that there's something up I guess you'd call Canary very bright a Canary do tend to. And on often security was assessed in less than ten thousand students at that time which is very low compared to the expected twenty million college students. Projected by the national center for education statistics as a fall twenty thousand fifteen. So my colleagues who speak to a broader national community studies. Con committee colleges from hope lab at Temple University shortly. But I'm hoping that is giving the context the national landscape in the studies we can then begin to look in the California and what we're learning here. So with these challenges the data points in mind the university of California has committed to drawing upon campus and systemwide leadership. To advance upstream approach to addressing student basic needs. So through president Apollo Tana those national global food initiative launched in twenty thirteen revert to line existing student support services and programs within a food access and basic needs framework. I initial efforts sought to reach the skill of needed to develop and implement and assess intervention is to address student food insecurity. As well as begin to better understand the housing and homelessness dimensions of basic needs for students. So from twenty fifteen to twenty eighteen we've senator efforts across research. Prevention and support. Advocacy collaboration an overall sustainability which I'll speak to you all today. So the university of California begin examining the issue of food insecurity and twenty fifteen starting with the student food access and security survey. Funded by president apartado is part of the global food initiative effort. To increase the response rate we use the national college assessment survey that is already set to be administered on for UC campuses. And the remaining six campuses the UC institutional research and academic planning division administered what we call the got food survey. These two surveys were administered online in spring twenty fifteen to a random sample of more than sixty six thousand students. Across ten campuses. Of those asked a participe eight eight eighty nine hundred thirty two undergraduate students and graduate students responded. And as you can see our initial finding it found that forty two percent of students who are low in very low food insecure. I miss other key findings that can be reviewed in the survey results. Share the member is an online hopefully with the materials from the session. From that the university of California's food security study inform the decision to revise our institutional assessment measures. So these measures include the UC undergrad experience survey the graduate wellbeing survey the undergraduate cost of attendance as well as a graduate cost of attendance survey. So with that a twenty sixteen twenty seventeen was oppressive year for search advancement on our basic needs efforts. By improving and expanding the cost of attendance survey for undergraduates. And launching for the first time ever costs of attend survey. In addition for quality of studies about. Basic. He did. The Berkeley you. Go UC Davis. IDC LA. CNN Greg experience survey team and the graduate well being. Survey team also. Thirteen homelessness it's into their surveys. Upon this larger interest and attention to the issue. Attempting to be respond. To help our efforts be more specific with the data in the research to inform who are best serving. And so it was Reyes around particular demographic identities combined have increased. Neither food security housing a security homelessness so that level three data as part of the results on that we don't time to speak about today but it does inform how we're. Serving the most at risk populations is a priority in our solutions. So forty four percent of undergraduate and in twenty six percent project students reported having experienced food insecurity. Which is in line with their twenty fifteen findings of forty eight and twenty five percent respectively so what we do those questions as we brought from eighty nine hundred students to over sixty six thousand students. Which serves the database for undergraduate graduate students to research an informant engage this really timely issue basic needs. So are prevention and support in twenty fifteen twenty fourteen twenty fifteen effort access and basic needs subcommittee initiated campus level working group's to better assess student needs. How are campus level as well as to inform system wide efforts? In recognizing there's a growing concern around student food security president Paul Tano allocated seventy five thousand per campus to address the immediate challenges of ensuring student access to nutritious food. While my self makocha room Kaneto from UC Berkeley developed a multi year strategic plan with our campus leadership. The NPI study of twenty fifteen and formed efforts to improve our data collection as discussed earlier. Across institutional student surveys activating central leadership in providing the capacity to better assess high risk student populations based on campus level specific data. And further the president committed additional three point three million over two years through twenty sixteen twenty eighteen divide emergency assistance financial aid and food literacy and life skills training. In a strength in the impact of food access and basic needs working group's efforts on each campus. The food access and security basic needs subcommittee sponsored by GFI and overseen by you see office of student affairs establish these working groups on each campus. Nay could acquittal representation from undergraduate graduate students staff faculty a community partners because again it does take a village power point or basic needs. Led by our chief I co chairs our food access NBC the working groups have been working closely together to address the challenges and develop implementation plans. To specifically address the unique needs of each respective campus. So over the last two years we've made significant headway on our food access and basic needs efforts. And this includes hosting semiannual system why basic needs meetings. Facility monthly system wide leadership causing quarterly professional development webinars. To better respond and engage our students and successful solutions. Releasing a Stanford access and security tool kit I campus level of security interventions. Establishing a basic needs outcome impact evaluation reporting system with timelines the campus efforts. Providing over twenty two thousand students with direct basic need services a supporting campus. Launching central online websites a communication resources for basic needs at all UC campuses. I'm already a seventy four basic needs resource centers with several more campus is going online by fall twenty eighteen so there multiservice centers for financially literacy. Advising and resources technical assistance in choice piece pantry selections. Engaging CDSS and comforts awareness in a rowing eight thousand students in California. Can we recently released the UC food and housing security reported December twenty seventeen. To provide more detail to what I'm sharing. I'm just very briefly on one additional support just looking at the aid the UC provides our students complemented by cal grant in the federal aid. We're trying to provide the best packages for students and even that you've heard the data of what our students are struggling and so I'd really and compassionate connect with the struggles of our sister sectors. In our students there in. Our every seeing collaboration really has extended across informing legislative policy we really appreciate the state's investment in concern. Our national engagement as we've traveled over thirty for conferences and meetings to build a network of higher education aware of the possibilities to change the struggles of our students and make solutions possible for all. And strengthen the partnership's across CDSS are food banks are homeless you services at our sister sectors. Which I have to give credit to it's so exciting to be on a panel with Colleen into these. A we've had strategic engagement to really think about what we can do across our sectors of the response of. In the three areas are developing a basic he's vision together and higher at. Building a proactive come communication engagement system which can help inform pending policy and other elements that come up. As well as sharing institutional research and analysis to ensure that were. Better asking the questions in one form how we help our students succeed from one system to the next. In going forward you see our model really is to flip the pantry at the bottom. That's a crisis resolution are proactive work these to go before they come to college whether it's at a communicative stated you see. Our early outreach programs need to understand basic needs financially literacy how to understand housing rental markets and what independence means the student as you come into your own. Sense of identity and growth in the university system. And then work on the campus level resources which we are practically doing sewer working herself up the pyramid into law it will be launched in the next phase of our work is the president called for a basic needs master plan. For the university of California. So just in closing I'd like to thank the committee and attendees and our partners. In the university of California stands at the state the CSU system the committee called system to comprehensively combat basic needs challenges that affect our students and families statewide. And we look for to provide any additional materials freeze in resources to inform the port work of this committee. Thank you very much. Thank you very much Jim. And now like to introduce doctor Denise Beverly a director student wellness and basic needs initiative at the California State University. Office of the chancellor. While you're pulling this about all joke so we have interns in the district office in our assembly office their high school students. And they were teaching me how to use Snapchat. And and we joke that don't teach me how to use Snapchat I'll teach them how to use a desktop. Hinton. So. Look that already we are perfect alright couldn't. Good afternoon my name is Denise babbling. And I'm Tom some of us that. And I am the director of student wellness and basic needs initiatives for the CSU. Thank you for this opportunity to share some work that's being done across our twenty three campuses to help students who experience challenges with basic needs. Particularly food and housing and security. Food in housing in security impacts many California college students. Just as it affects countless communities across the nation. A recently released national study found that forty eight percent of student respondents reported food insecurity within the previous thirty days. And those of those sixty four percent also in support it experiencing some level of housing and security. And twenty fifteen the CSU commission of phase one snapshot study of a small student population that found that approximately. One in five students experienced food insecurity while one in twelve experience housing insecurity. We recently completed phase two. A more robust first of a kind of its kind study out released in February twenty eighteen which confirmed my much of the data from the snapshot study. I know most everyone here is probably somewhat familiar with the California State University at many of you have friends and family. Who have likely it? Graduated from the CSU but in grief across our twenty three campuses we have almost half a million students. Who comprise of the most ethnically economically and academically diverse student body and the nation more than half of our CSU students our students of color? One in three are the first in their families to go to college. And fifty two percent of undergraduates are recipients of the Pell grant. The CSU the powerful engine of social mobility. Providing students an opportunity to earn a high value degree and into the workforce prepared for the future. Our commitment to CSU students and the academic and future success. Necessitates a commitment to supporting their basic needs. When students basic needs are not addressed it can have an impact on both their personal and academic growth. Impeding their ability to achieve their goals and earned a degree. That is why and student well being is a priority in our graduation initiative twenty twenty five. The CS is planned to ensure that all students have the opportunity to be successful and graduate in a timely manner. Positively impacting their future and producing additional graduates to power California's economy and innovation. The results from the snapshot study work to action for the CSU. That we must do more to help our students who need it the most. And I am proud to say that that call was. Answered across the CSU. I campuses have been hard at work linking students to resources services and programs. That address students security housing displacement and homelessness and financial crisis. For students struggling with food insecurity all twenty three of our campuses at either a food pantry or a food distribution program. All campuses provide cal fresh application assistance to eligible students so that they might have healthy eating options. And a majority of our campuses offer meals through meal sharing and meal voucher programs for example. Fresno state offers a comprehensive food security program that includes an on campus food pantry a meal sharing program cal fresh out reach an application assistance and a campus garden. That provides students with access to fresh fruits and vegetables additionally Fresno was one of the first campus in the nation to develop an app that alert students to available food that's left over from on campus events. Preventing foodways and providing an opportunity for students to receive free food. Since you campus is also provide students with short term emergency housing. More than two thirds of our campuses offer on campus emergency housing or vouchers for off campus housing. For example I CSU Chico staff provide students facing emergency house. Facing emergency housing crisis hotel vouchers to provide short term relief and the campus will serve as a co signer on lease agreements to help students transition into long term housing. Similarly Northridge will provide funding for security deposits to help students and need of procuring housing. In addition CSU campuses also provide financial assistance to students in need. More than eighty percent of CSU students receive some form of non loan aid. But beyond federal state instructional financial aid programs the majority of our campuses also offer fight on emergency grants and funds. For example San Jose state offers emergency grants for students that they are not required to repay. Sacramento state also offers emergency grants and host financial literacy workshops to teach students about money management and budgeting. And many of our campus have targeted fund raising campaigns aimed at raising funds for basic needs resources for example at CSU eight East Bay. The campus and associated students work together to establish a campaign to solicit donations from the community and support of students basic needs. And the first year alone more than a hundred and sixty thousand dollars. In donations were secure as well as eighteen hundred over eighteen hundred mil swipe donations. Nineteen hundred donated items and forty five hundred dollars in emergency aid. These are just a few examples of program services and outreach that exist across the CSU. System wide we are implementing the CSU basic needs initiative to coordinate services across campuses helping them reach all students in need of support. Initiate negative is structured around five areas. The first of the dressing addressing the immediate needs of students. The second growing campus based. Campus based basic needs services so they can reach a decent additional serve our students. The third scaling best practices from one campus to across the system. The fourth working with partners in collaborating. And the fifth is ensuring long term sustainability a basic need services. And February. Just last month we had are system wide basic needs initiative conference which by together close to three hundred attendees. To share current best practices learn from national experts and develop action plans for further program development to address students basic needs. Assembly woman Weber provide a powerful inspiring words challenging us to continue working toward eradicating student hunger. And homelessness on our campuses and throughout the country. And on that note I'd like to also thank you and legislative colleagues for your support of our efforts the two point five million dollars recently allocated. To all three of the higher ed systems in California for Senate bill eighty five. Has been very helpful in the CSU those dollars are being distributed to all twenty three campuses to help them be designated as hunger free. These funds are critical in helping campuses develop implement and enhanced resources related to food insecurity and housing display set. We are proud the vision our campuses have taken to address these concerns head on and continue to support their efforts from the chances office. We also know that there is much more to be done. And look for to with our local state and federal legislative allies to help us ensure that all students are able to have the opportunity to be six. Thank you. Thank you doctor billion and doctor belly mentioned doctor Weber. Who's coming over from San Diego is also on other select committee for the master plan she was able to be here today but he's been very gates throughout the whole process. And I'd like to introduce Colleen Gimli EMR man. Program specialist for the California community college chancellor's office I killings. Thank you thank you for having us. I'm shorter senator. So I am hopeful that. A little bit lower thank you. Thank you to the committee for allowing us to come and share some information with you. On my name is Colleen Ganley Ammerman and I'm with the community college chancellor's office in my work buckets include food. Housing. Mental health self foster youth homelessness out. For our students so. It's AB fab pretty tall charge but I'm very excited that our office. Pacific we hired someone to work on these issues. I'm first. Time that I'm aware of that there's been someone designated to work on these issues. So a little bit about our system we are seventy two districts a hundred and fourteen colleges and we serve two point three million students. And I think it is noteworthy that out of that total student population two thirds are considered part time students. Meaning they're taking less than twelve units and these students are often adult working adults students. I their parenting students. Their students that are working multiple jobs to make ends meet. And we also have a demographically very diverse student body. I in two thousand seventeen our board of governors. Adopted formally adopted a new vision for success. For our system. Listed on this slide are the metrics that are driving that new vision for success I won't go into great detail but I have provided a link. About each of these metrics and the time frames established for this new vision for success. Bob. And I want to shift to talk a little bit about basic need data that we know nationally and at the state level. We. So nationally of the Wisconsin hope lab conducted a survey in two thousand seventeen. That survey included seventy community colleges across the country. We had fourteen California community colleges participate in that survey. And the data shows that two and three community college students report being food and chick insecure fifty percent report being housing insecure and thirteen. To fourteen percent report being homeless. And while we do not have statewide data that reflects the community college student body one of our larger districts Los Angeles community college district who participated in the Wisconsin hope lab. Up pulled Ste almost six thousand of their students as almost sixty three percent report being food insecure fifty five percent reporting housing insecure. And a whopping almost nineteen percent of the students in the Los Angeles community college district report being homeless which to me is quite staggering. Especially given the fact that generally speaking we don't have housing resources in the community college system. We have eleven districts that offer housing resources a. On campus dorms. So this this. A rise in awareness about these issues. Is a call to action for our office and also for the others segments. I'm we conducted a basic needs survey across our campuses asking faculty staff and administrators what kind of resources were available to college students to help meet their basic needs. We have. A hundred and five responses two hundred and thirty nine individual respondents. And this is what they told us about food pantries a sixty eight percent reported having food pantries on campus. Sixty almost sixty two percent reported having support for cow freshen Roman on campus. And almost sixty one percent reported other available food resources including meal vouchers grocery gift cards farming farmers market products. And so you might ask how are we funding these efforts there. Generally speaking there are not designated resources to address the basic needs for community college students. Unfortunately for us and as Denise alluded to we got to a half million dollars of one time funds. On for food security activities on our campuses we also received a one time apportionment for a foreign half million dollars for mental health services. And I'll talk a little bit more toward the end of my presentation about what we're doing around mental health services. But I want to jump into the hunger free campus activities. These funds were allocated to support that either creating or expanding your campus paid food. Campus based food pantries. And also ensuring that students have information about how fresh but fits I'm all of the community colleges that are willing to facilitate these two activities are eligible to get these funds. In preparation for this work our office of hosted eleven regional cow freshen Roman training. Trainings across the state we had eighty to community colleges. Faculty staff and administrators to these trainings we reached over five hundred with a day long training with the goal of. Training faculty and staff about the application process and what are the barriers students typically experience. The demand was overwhelming we would like to additional trainings but there was such a hunger across our system. From faculty staff and administrators to understand what are the barriers that students are experiencing when applying for cal French because it's not just as direct as. Filling out an application there's multiple steps and there's bond lots of things that the students need to do to actually access the benefits. I'm we are also offering technical assistance to the colleges and we are. Connecting. Cao for staff at the county level with colleges we are connecting local food banks with the colleges. We have joined our sister segments on an inter segmental up policy research work group and we've also assembled a small nimble and mighty. Aye internal workgroup with leadership from the system and from the community colleges themselves to work on these issues. We work with external partners including the department of social services you STA. We have a blossoming relationship with CSU Chico on I'm getting some federal reimbursement for cal fresh outreach activities on campus and that's new to our system. Some were very excited be hosting our first ever basic need summit. It's going to be in Sacramento on April twenty six and twenty seven. And so I wanna switch back a little bit and talk about mental health services and what we're doing in that effort. And I would say when I was listening to the folks talk about the ratio of mental health providers. To student. Us stood numbers. Who generally speaking we have maybe one two or three practitioners at the outer most? To serve thirty forty fifty thousand students stone there is a real need I think the legislature. I recognize that and included some funding some one time funding. But we have very very limited resources to support many many students who have. S. and depression anxiety thank you. So we had for a half million dollars now we facilitate a request for application process were in the process of approving those. Now. The goals of that are to. Provide direct services to train faculty and staff and to help colleges get connected with their county governments I'm sorry the county behavioral health. There's a few statewide. System resources that our office is sponsoring we have ag a suicide prevention gatekeeper training them that we've had. Available to the community colleges for about six years. We've got I'm there's three student facing modules and three faculty staff facing modules. To date we've trained almost seventy thousand people. We are. Collaborating with an organization a national organization called the crisis text line. Home where they provide tax base mental health services we created tool kits and hopefully any community college that you go to. You will see these incredible posters and business cards and that key change in. The any kind of collateral material to let students know about the service it's a free service. And so far we have just under two thousand students who have access this service we're very proud of the relationship with crisis text line. And then finally we are working with our health services association and our online education initiative and we're developing student facing modules in canvas which is our online education platform. And this is just a small sample of the topics so why student logs into their canvas account. And what there is to get their grades or whether it's to get. Any of the materials and or to even access our classes. Out they will see a list of about twenty five or thirty. Modules that really that delve into all of the things. That could be impeding their academic progress so those are. Absent system wide resources that we're very proud of home given the limitations on what we have to work with. So there's my contact information thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with you and thank you to the students. I'm it it takes a lot of courage to come up and talk in front of this group. Great. Thank you very much Colleen. And with a look at open my colleagues for any questions or comments about how. Doctor metal. Church. I would feel remiss not to humble brag a little bit about Fresno state and the work that Mary Castro of our First Lady has done. It shows the true need that we have within our Valley and it reminds me of a quote from says search office. That he finds it ironic that we pick fruits and vegetables to fill others table to such abundance. And yet have so little left for ourselves. Growing up here in the Central Valley in the breadbasket of the world it's. Truly a shame. That our Fresno state students have such great need. In the past eighteen months alone they've used that food pantry fifty thousand times. And it shows we as a state have a responsibility to try to help out. As the budget sub chair of subcommittee one I oversee the cal fresh. Department and wanted to ask a question about that if I could. I wanted took follow up and understand if there were specific improvements on functionality. Could we help to improve. This government service and make it more accessible for our students and if we can follow up after the fact and have specific recommendations and ideas. On how to do that I'd like to. There is a bipartisan group right now that are working to make improvements with and cal fresh both to increase benefits. But also to make it work better for communities. So with that I just wanted to say thank you for your testimony and. And appreciate what you brought today. Thank you doctor regular. Senate Allen well I just wanna first of all appreciate the extraordinary work that has been described to me it you know. You know with with limited resources. Seems like all three the systems are stepping up and trying their best to you to figure out ways to address some of these you know pretty unnerving challenges that exist. With our students and and you know there's certainly a lot of work to be done and and a lot of gaps in the estimates were very ably described by. Her to student speakers out but but I I am I'm glad to see that systems stepping up and taking this issue very seriously. I will say yeah I've seen ninety white. As. I'm sure that you get to me she's coming testified a couple times both the their house of the budget sub. And. I'm certainly hoping that. By the time I turn out of the Senate I will see her in the legislature. Because she really has been a tremendous student leader both at the board level and also I'm as president Acosta conference states dudes association and I. I. I think you have office and. I think you get any so I hope to hope to see you join us and I wanted to ask Mr. Gallagher no I'm just one quick question about the food security data a when you mention that forty two percent of the California you see students are. Food insecure. There's another line in your side that says child history food security is a twenty three percent is that to mean. That. I'm. That twenty three percent of the students in the UC system. Experience three in security before they got college when they were when their kid. Correct in that it's and it's beyond that so it's not just limited resource students that come from all different sectors they may choose to. Have a same gender partner the family rights them off or you have a different life decision that then cuts them off of him fast for their still dependent. I'm the lower finding is that they're all forms of insecurity that just not does not directly correlated child food security. And so we have a lot more data and with eight minutes I could only share so much. So could have been effectively. So you are you. So that this part of the point you're making here is that. That out of those you see of the other students who are food insecure. You note nearly half of a for nearly half of its is actually relatively new experience I think yes yeah I heard. In the both very difficult things to have gone through for sure but and and and both going to present their own challenges. That's correct. And in the idea is that. That. You know the user that there for the that the folks who were not food secure but now are when they get school. That you know because the basic their parents of kind of said Hey you're eighteen now you're off in college you're taking care yourself and they don't have the resources to. Correct the other struggles real for them and. The free college basic needs literacy is nonexistent we don't have the capacity currently kid to twelve prepare students. So that they have no inclination of where to go or what to do was our first you know commitment was to get the communication. Centralize the resources and. Let students know that we're here for them. Okay I appreciate that that's very interesting. Then you Mister Allen. It. I is one question I had one comment that one question one comment is. I really appreciated. You know folks are talking about. Mental health needs. And and I've been focusing are presented a district and some communities of really struggled with you've mental health issues. And we focus a lot on high school students and junior high school students. But it but as I think about it we with it too. Youth suicide cluster the past eight years. And in both of those who is also some recent graduates of high school. Ends and so college students and so we're gonna and work with my staff to figure out if we can integrate. De the higher education systems into some the work that we've been doing. And the work they were doing this year. If. You can give them what they. A bunch of you are really all you you know I had that certain recommendations are or alluded to problems and and I can guess what the recommendations would be but. If you just give us one or two recommendations of either changes to the master plan or things that the legislature can do. To address. The issues that you're either facing personally as students or seeing as administrators on campus what would those be. Thank you so much that question I really appreciate that. And and you know there's there's twenty floating around my brain very. Alternative very quickly to. Amulets doctor badly was it three million that the systems. Receive just recently five is two point five million I think having earmarked funds and for our schools around mental health counselling. And it can't be for every single campus particularly in my case was yes he's missed ten campuses that don't have. That ratio gap the one fifteen hundred I'm I'm looking at those Fresno state house LA San Francisco state. And looking at those schools and trying to it as a very first at getting those ratios from one counselor to three thousand more students to at least one to fifteen hundred. I think that makes a real difference. I think the campus says that have already done an amazing job advertising those services been they get overwhelmed we don't have the resources to back at. And I think this generation what something that's amazing about assets or myself in there. Were a lot more willing to talk about our problems. And maybe that's due to social media we feel that we can really put things out there and see how. But if we get to that point we were seeking help and were in a way rejected. I think that has long lasting consequences for the individual law. And so making sure that the campus says can have their sources to back up those promises a basic needs and particularly and. For mental health counselors on those impacted campus says. And frankly I I know that there's been a lot of attention to. To the food pantries on to become says I keep referencing Fresno state factually meet we just as of last week. And I had a chance to tour the food pantry and it was. Fantastic I know they're going to use some of that money that that was just received recently. To put an more refrigeration units. More shelving work more produce. And I walked in and I saw students. So freely using it without embarrassed and or anything like that just. Shopping through the aisles for for produce for bread. I would love to see that scale on every single campus but if you have a chance against absolutely fantastic it's just committee that his one people who runs it. Along with did marry Castro. And just absolute dedication everything from the campus. To make this something that isn't stigmatize isn't all. You can go any time and I was going to question your means testing of do you really dead. I know that campus based banking the legislature can do a lot to encourage that and define the in a sustainable way seven keep that going first. You're much. Noticed briefly share think adding basic needs the master plan with clear metrics that work within the interstate all sector and the legislature so that we can evaluate the measure report and work together. Really exciting and I think really timely for this generation of work because of the scope of the problem. There's mental health in this food housing security you don't know which one will show first of how to support a student. But we need to align the resources and think about the dotted lines to really connect in between those services. In our system so. On the second element would be considering the types of policy that can intercept across these SP five is great for the housing or the food specifically. We brought housing that we've connected mental health so to be exciting to see what kind of path for be have. With that as well so thank you for asking that question extent. I agree with. Everyone spoken so far I would say to adds that is definitely the Caltrans. Program an opening that up so that there is. Less red tape and hoops for students to have to jump through. Specifically the twenty hour work week rule is it's tough for a lot of students. Especially those who are and medical. Have medical. At medical school or having to do internships or things like that they're not able to work those twenty hours so. They're they're you know there's a lot of red tape around that I'm the only thing I would add is. Maybe some legislation around affordable housing around campuses. And even with some of our campuses and in and around campus is doing new construction maybe having something in the contract that speaks to. Providing affordable housing units for students. Matter hereby campuses. The Germans. There's. I think that. Sustaining the allegations that have been made to the systems for food security is something that would be very useful and we see an incredible growth across the community college system. Updates of colleges really putting together robust food pantries. I would also see that the. Now how service act fund and this is sort of a one off but it. Mental health services is really an issue for our students and for our system. I think I know there's currently a bill that. Speaks to using mental health service act funds for in higher education I think that certainly. Worth. Investigating further and supporting. Them the department of health care services also has a project that has primarily been targeted to K. twelve students for many years. Called local education agency and it is a program that allows the K. twelve system to bill medi cal. For mental health and physical health services were working with the department health care services but I'm not sure if it could possibly take a number of years to get. The regulations modified. To allow community colleges that was a bill that allowed community colleges back in two thousand fifteen. To begin up filling the LA a medi cal billing program. But there some regulatory up barriers to making that happen and we currently have. All fifteen community colleges that are interested to start billing and. We have some regulatory barriers to be able to do that. Thank you. I wouldn't love to follow up if I could on the mental health services act. Have quite a bit of questions about that as well as the commission and. Just want to make sure it's working for our communities. It's just good governance for us to look at. In particular looking at cal fresh there is an opportunity this year I'm going to be working with another assembly member on try figure out how to streamline. The application and make it work better for so would love to follow up on both of those ideas. Thank you Sanam doing the I want to buy mentioned executive a lot higher and people here. Today and I am a. You knew we had we had a little bit of a chat about this at the used roundtable and present the Poltava came. I know you brought up the issue of of for a housing your campuses and of course one of things we're looking at even in the context of today's discussion is that they're just very different. Communities where we have campuses manner some. Where that the housing? Where that the land costs the development costs are are relatively well least by California standards? And then you got places like I la Vista that was mentioned before by UC Santa Barbara the in the area around Westwood UCLA. Yeah Berkeley and it there just just out of control costs that are really really tough and I was just really struck by the students comments about having a pac twelve people into a two bedroom. Apartment is unbelievable. I'm. Like the old tenants of. The Laurie side. I. But when they I should mention is it did in those communities. It is proven to be very difficult for ride variety of reasons to do development. And. And you know that's really something that the that the legislature's looking at. But the campuses themselves in the foot three key systems and actually have a lot of discretion was are a lot more discretion. A lot more power over the land use decisions the construction decisions on their own camps is it enough feel that way. When you've gone through. The. The headaches of trying to build and additional student housing on campus. Because of all the pressures you get from the neighborhood and the community but but you know as a matter of law the campuses have a lot more power to do what they want on their. Land then any other type of developer. And. So you know as hard as it may feel to do that sort of development it's harder do a. Sometimes off campus and I think I really courage the campuses to be bald and and. And in assessing and addressing. Their housing needs. You know on their own land I will sell I just the other day I was out. Of the van the brilliance of Berkeley the chancellor Berkeley keen on the Los Angeles to talk about what was happening as person actually ask a question about student housing. Cost because it has become such a big problem and the chancellor announced them they're going to be doing a lot of work. Pushing forward with student housing on various plots of land that they have around. And the Berkeley campus. And and I I was just I was glad to see that their barreling ahead on this. If there other campuses you wanna have conversations with them I would be happy to facilitate. Because they're there you do have sovereign powers as as a public our institutions of higher education. And then I could you to utilize those powers. Good point thank you very much please. Join me in in thinking the panelists. In the last panel will be a panel on ensure ensuring equity in student excess. And I'm like to introduce our Han drew lamellae student at Long Beach college. Manuel John to can't to student at Fresno Pacific university. As well as Michelle. That I see Siqueiros seat Seguros Seguros Seguros. President of the campaign for college opportunity. And Benjamin Duran Duran. During that return. Duran. Honestly. Executive director Central Valley higher education consortium I got are the first. Not in my. Something goes. Gonna. As born Texas. So thank you very much and we'll get started. The with all hunger. Great thank you. So is there is a generation gap they live off my computers like cater on everywhere at that. I'm gonna just go over this if that's okay. No that's perfectly fine calling your colleague of racial to stay up there for it. LA or has given. So hello everyone I'm aims all a hundred million I am a student along which should be college. Else have the privilege of serving as vice president the. Statewide soon organization disincentive California commune colleges and where an organization that represents. The over two point three million since across our system. Seek Intel la a membership of about thirty members not quite equitable in regards to see membership we try our best to put the concerns of all of our students in various demographic groups. I think it's a little of myself. I can tell you are you know when I first decided to return back. To. School after may your half break I I would never have imagined I still still being here four years later. I can tell you that I never would imagine myself having to jump out of several classes ID two conflicting work schedules as well as. You know. Don't think through three part time jobs at a time and in doing that now continuously try to balance that on a daily basis. And I never would have match myself maybe justice matters specifically having to drop a communication sixty class three separate times because those counted on me. De to just conflicting schedules and class cancellations and. I most certainly would never thought four years from now earlier that I would be here at Fresno City call speaking to you all. About some issues in regards to soon equity in academic success. I'm so this should be a it's a surprise to some of you but the time would you colleges being a two year institution is no longer. The case. You know. Glazer Frazier how the chance office is that sixty seven percent of students actually graduate or receive their any type of degree within two years. In fact the practice of students taking longer than two years is so embedded into our system that a lot of our data Ste track students and six your cohorts. Not giving up enough I'm to be reactionary and really giving us a sense of what we imagine Camino college students to be right six year students. So bingo myself ring from allow American background I sometimes he was so caught between two worlds right. Semi Hispanic culture we value education at any level but for many reasons a lot of our lot of my people do not complete or even attempt any type of higher education a lot you know it's not. How my mother and father never had the opportunity to attend high school let alone a middle school? They're busy immigrating over and joining immediately into the work force to fight for themselves and their family that was to come. And whenever I valley's Mexican so visits and heroes asking how schools going in for the most part exotic and spending any time at all in my higher education journey. We also value the commitment to hard work. Adult thing that thought has ever occurred so I Perrance I would never be able to not work while attending college. There's never that's never occurred to them whether my sister graduated from you see your seats you. That you can only commit to school they have the mentality that you can you have to work while attending college in that's a lot of the culture that we come from right. We have to have a commitment. On the contrary so friends of different a brings up the question how my decisions to take a year off for my decision Steven work while attending college right. They bring up the question about what ifs what if I decided to go into university which had the option to do from three at a high school. On the opposite suggestions that maybe should stop working as much or even all together. Or they ask me don't take any breaks in between are just push through. And as much as I'd like to see how my tener five year plan is. Like already implant mapped out is the reality is that things don't work out the way I planned them to things to work out for students with the plan themselves to do as well. And yes it shows the focusing on my education if I really truly wish to be successful maybe I'm spending too much time working maybe I'm spending too much trying to trying to earn some money and not focusing on my degree. But there should be some form of balance a balance ratchet still be able to fill my cultural and work responsibilities while attending school. And they will be able to complete those within two and three years I am. So what's holding students back. Is it the remediation are basic skills that sets students up immediately in a position where they have no other option but to finish a sequence of course that can easily take two or three years just to even reach transfer level. Is it course offerings and scraps in class scheduling that are unpredictable and sometimes offer zero suggestions for students to move for from any type of sequence. Is that the cultural piece that sometimes isn't translated correctly when speaking to a counselor who may not look like me. Or know about the future plans in my expected thousand I'll use. Is the lack of financial aid resources to support attending a college that requires a one hundred fifty dollars textbook that my professors wrote themselves I'd know the option of buying it for my individual tech a. Cold bookstore. Is it the misrepresented sticker price of college that attending university doesn't accurately represent the cost of attendance. Is it even more widespread of conversation we had earlier that students have such a minimal resource that they're suffering from food and housing in security. And such unstable livings condition that it's affecting their performance. The answer improving student equity and academic success around a cabs isn't just fixing a simple issue are placing reactive proposals. You know just our media education alone. From a report that's right for the legislative analyst's office to some of our. Members here in March. You're three quarters of first time Camino college students are determines unprepared. More than forty percent of CSU students are determined as unprepared. And twenty percent of those first time you see students are also declared is impaired. So from the onset we are you know alone in Marin and maneuvering through an almost archaic website to fill a confusing application questions. We wait in lines for possible times only to be told you have to come back in two three weeks to meet with a counselor. The has a one to seven hundred seat a ratio. We hope that our financial aid if awarded is dispersed early enough to have our books by the second week of class. All and managing to balance the successful work family and you know some of us have a social life. So institutions will tell you that they'll be the first to tell you that they're doing everything they can to improve the idea of academic success of students but even if the tools are there we need to do a better job assistance at those tools. Really are there and where to find them. So there been out if I can offer some suggestions on how we can move forward in specifics incommunicado ge's you know I I've been involved the committee because system for a few years now and I've been of involved a lot of conversations and. Most recently has been a conversation that's kind of. You know was a little weird to me and it's it's a conversation on moving towards this idea of a fifteen unit Tory more of a full time. Unit load for students right fifteen units per semester making it a thirty units a year total and I know there's a. Individuals argue that you know fifteen units are doing its will get students there faster. But I would argue that students of knowledge in the full time status now will not will not be incentivize by. At an extra increase in financial aid to push them through right. Let's say give a scenario of a single mother I working. She's taking nine units right now barely making them and I'm not even qualify for full time. And additional grant of two or three thousand dollars isn't gonna keep her from child taking care of those family values. And that's a look at the reality we face for a lot of our students now. You know we talked about earlier and and you know Devon talking made a great point that a lot of our students are returning students and. Is a huge number of data surrounding the and I consider myself retiring soon and I only took a year and a half off. To students to come back five ten years later don't even have. This ability or even the generational skills sometimes even knew over there are systems. And. If you move forward toward the system of you know providing more resources to individuals of full time status of more than twelve units are fifteen units. I really urge you all to this to talk the reality that might be displacing some questions now. Beautifully thing that displacing of students that are even eligible for full time status now in even further of writing this a resources to competitors across our system. Another suggestion I would hope. Would be to write an additional focus on maybe I'd idea of course scheduling class offerings. In the realities I faces a communicative students when I first enrolled. I didn't know what classes are going to be offered at you know a semester ahead of time and that's a really lot Communicorp students face. And assist you that and you see my pillow different we can map out a two year plan. But I've never understood how we expect students to maneuver system within two years when administrators and faculty leaders can never even planned out of your head in the course scheduling. You know when you have a chance to. You know center over account isn't colleges do more what we're planning to count their the class offerings. Nam sometimes we look at class offerings were it not really focusing on begins I'm for dividend graphic groups are work groups in regards to evening and weekend classes. And no surprise when I visit you see issues you campus and I go there in the evening and there such. You know is a popular student life and it's driving in this its is so encouraging to see that people are wanting around the evenings when I visit local community colleges and there's no one passed by PM. You know offices are closed sometimes we extend hours the first or second week of class but for the students who cannot get those appointments within that that first time period. Are left to work on themselves and work from home and try to figure out you know on minor maneuver whatever system they have set a plate. And. If we want to continue our conversations in regards through mediation yeah I'm hoping to have a meaningful conversation around that we also need to be open to the idea casa mixed expectations I not be on par with the reality of some students academic levels. So the conversations relying on you know on placement test is that students levels is also changing right. Mortal measures have come to the forefront deciding we believe students ready we most successful. Things like high school GPA previous workload or even a thirty minute counts or visit can have just as enormous affect on whether I had to take two semesters of map before reaching a transfer level. Where they have to take? Against you keep me from being enrolled in another required class but whatever idea placement isn't you know entirely after. An assessment test can be seen as a way for two seconds scores for students expected. Achievement levels because we use the tool to assist faculty in providing an adaptive courts and adaptive working environment for students. Faculty can finally learn some for my data to students who test intercourse and a bit dot the courses to more realistic level person success. This information copy made available using high school transit bit especially for those who don't self report. An assessment to my not be the answers to our questions surrounding placement and remediation but it can be argued that we need more compatible data to go about creating adjusting reflect the courses instead of using outdated metrics that may negatively impact some of our students. So we hope to continue like on successes of passed bills like assembly bill seven of five who was also forming even greater data sharing relationship with a key to talk partners. If remediation such an issue you know where there's a start is it at the key to twelve level are we not preparing them from segment to segment. Center board data can only get so far and would sometimes no way of verifying that information without some validation procedures. They'll be some and I pay place since along the way. And hope although these partnerships may only benefit those populations coming straight out of high school. A huge portion of our students to come out at system we must encourage their students as well. The conversations are on equity instance success on singular issues since success is directly related issue discussed earlier like college affordability and basic needs. There's no doubt that these issues of affect our students differently some more than others but if you plan to move forward toward relevant vision for twenty first higher education system. In this consent it continue to ensure that these and. This plan meets the needs of all of our students whether they be working adults single mothers straight outta high school. You know different ethnic groups image keep that in mind if you plan to move forward towards a better future. Okay. Thank you very much alone Euronext it will have mean well John can to. Hello everybody think for. Hearings held today and then you committee. It's refreshing to see that you guys are act to see some like a committee actually hearing SO near soon you can get lost in. The today's stuff sorts affirming a guest. And so money was menu can to I'm I am academic journey starts a small rule city club foreign. My farm is city that is over ninety percent spending. And in cemex most ruled smaller or cities and sell can Valley my farm is home to many long come in immigrant families. And as a result of the low income area the school district of should not receive from the same funding as other. Property to the public taxes most. Some areas surrounding fund. This means the fund had facilities and programs that sometime some might consider sub par. So it is very easy for someone to look at McFarland perceived as a density. And to be honest that's something I did for so long. I looked up and fund and I thought. And what in appreciation time finally matured. And I start to recognize my success in college thus far. Until I finally. It wouldn't taste. Sorry Canaris. That's. That's a good music. But longtime insurance start to recognize mixed success in because that's part and started preaching the role models around me. I realize what Fong was a great place. I like despite depend inequity McFarland to find myself reading and encouraged to succeed higher education. I was prepared because I was better the gray pants and a great family. Acknowledge them because they are the real reason for my success. My grandparents emigrated from Mexico but the bus had a program that hopes of living the American dream. There of course face many hardships. And but they managed to instill the idea of grit and determination to my parents. As a result of their efforts both my parents would eventually graduate from college and my father also continue to receive master's degree and become a school administrator. So the stages are had already been set for me to be more likely to succeed. I did not know that. I was always looking at my environment and comparing it to other places in thinking McFarlane wasn't good enough. My junior college in Bakersfield wasn't good enough. And finally anti. I'm not sure to make you into for the Pacific university they realize that those all those things were good enough. I'd. I realized that my parents were a product of small towns and farmland I thought supportive all the teachers that I. That I looked up to a part of the same type of smart spending communities. All faculty members also part of small communities. Also despite the low funding in our schools many teachers up to put extra hours to. For cadre news programs like added writing workshops for public personal statements mother look back and see the value in going up in McFarland. Promoted to look like me surround me and lead me to believe that anything could be possible. My experience in higher education has been quite different. Then high school of course the financial burden of college pushed into spend a few years at local communicative ge. Going up all the oldest and then you realize. That your parents at the finance for others students in college you can of the but bullet and a. Start off at a community college. But. Although the colleges different took awhile for me to just my parents were always by my side. My parents wouldn't mind me to visit my cancer every week because he to be proactive my transferring. My parents are my me don't believe to director time opposite between all those classes they remind me. That and and the degree would be worth all the effort. Out of venture transferred to prison Pacific within two years of for the five units. Since I didn't fully listen to my parents about being proactive my courses it would come back to haunt me. Got a bunch of. Five years instead of four. But I have no regrets I'm happy with my progress. The be the good thing about the minor mistake. Is that my brother would eventually transferred to you for the Pacific university. And then try to state and be on the right track to graduate. Immediately. So I was happy I was here from the percent Pacific university I saw that. He was the home* side continued Pullman knows down hit the books and get the grades I need. And so if I can relate my story to the broader student population. I would encourage students to try and find hope in their minor minor but no matter what it is. Look for all models that we're power you to do your best I wished I was a cookie cutter solution I could offer you a punch in the dry direction of several model. The process you deserve process you have to discover for yourself a to my parents another teacher for granted not until use them. For. As a research again the fearsome become more active in Texas that success so. I think this is also true that universities can provide and help. Fix equity in our communities. I visit the city university all the plan about many things that can help improve equity instant success. I would come is because of what I call repair mentor. Is my favorite job on campus and I think it's a great step in the right direction to improve equity. As a multicultural peer mentor I am one of the six to stressors as a role model friend. Or mentor to help people their first generation college students navigate through higher education. But opponents fund by the US program to advance Medina academic success and the good thing about is that we for surfers generation college students so any first generation students. Contention to be a part of our program. First generations and third generation cautions cannot be Lassen universe things university since I don't have that family member who basic shell before them and higher education. There ought to not real friend is the right decision for them. Parents often don't do not their parents not often understand the challenges. That their children may face insular Zemin tango but grow between parent and child. First generation soon sometimes do not know how to manage our time outside of a high school setting. These two three all prioritize work over staying to help out their family's financial burdens. Students under duck out also sometimes fear for applying to government programs in general. It can be very scary for students be experiencing these troubles and realize that their parents cannot help them despite all their efforts. This can be very discouraging for students so is our job to bridge the gap. For these tunes and be that role model to help them stay on most. Stay on the path and most. At image. To help them. To give them more wild role models that are wiser. And that look like them. We will be the first ones who you keep all those tunes as best we can. So University should provide students with dub twenty to ten different social awareness program to be part of different scholarship programs and interact with people on a different social spheres. University to be able to encourage leaders to be aware and Chile represent their student body. I believe students benefit the most when their mentors relate to that doesn't mean I have to be some of the same race. But the leadership be competent and consider enough to hear their situations. And. Students should know that their pine self and they should not be unjustly help of success hard work should be only Kate only thing the gauges success. Last if you come from. If you come from home place you that your band showcase your ability to overcome adversity and rice a challenge. That is a vital skill set that you get the police have if you're a person that comes from an equity and succeeds did your. Did your but do your best to become a role model to other people. I do inspiration for many people who I didn't even know. Every colleges acceptance letter that I heard about. From an upperclassman was a great inspiration to me every time I heard that someone transferred to university in two three years does a great inspiration to me. Every time I heard about some can you tell that right after college thousand inspiration to me and they may never have even known. So. So you can sure you can't by people. By own personal success and the test when you can share slash shared trend of generation of success. Abby that starts at the university level by applying great leaders. Great points thank you man well. I next that we have Michelle sekeras president of the campaign for college opportunity. Thank you. Thank you didn't. Good afternoon now. Chair Berman and members of the committee and everyone here thank you for inviting me to participate in this hearing more importantly thank you for having the hearing it for the work that you're doing. I am I just wanted a state for the record I also was not around in the nineteen sixties. Although my daughter does say that I'm ancient and on my last birthday ask me how that felt. My name's Michelle cicadas I'm president of the campaign for college opportunity. And I used to always say that. I was super lucky that I got to college. You see my mother I immigrated here from Mexico with only a sixth grade education. I she had no idea how to help me fill out that faster which all of you should know is due tomorrow if you want to be eligible for cal grant aid tell everyone you know. Tell every undocumented student that they can still access the dream act. So I used to say that I was lucky that I was able to fill out that Pfaff said that I was. Encouraged to apply to college that I ended up going to Pitzer and then to UCLA on affirmative action scholarship. And then I got out of college with about sixteen thousand dollars and dad. I out which was pretty fantastic at that time given the world class education I gotta both institute tions. But now I tell everybody that it's absolutely not at all related to lock. In fact it's related to everything that you can make happen and that you do S. policymakers. Because it was policymakers that insured there was financial aid so I could go to college. That there were student loans so that I could afford to get there and get through. I and it was those affirmative action. Supports that allowed me to go to graduate school and be the first in my family to or not only a bachelor's degree but a master's degree. The campaign for college up to ninety was founded by folks that were around in the nineteen sixties. In fact David wolf and Steve Winer were baby boomers that got to benefit from the master plan promise. Got to go to you see for free. Are if you can imagine. And were dismayed in the early two thousands that our state leaders were not funding higher education sufficiently to make sure that students could have. That promise that we've all talked about. So they founded the campaign for college opportunity. And our focus and mission has not changed since two thousand and four and that's that more Californian should have the opportunity to go to college. That once they get there they should actually complete college and that we should be unabashed unapologetic about closing the racial and ethnic gaps that persist in California higher education. I'm much has changed since we started at the campaign for college opportunity fourteen years ago. We've done a lot more to grow access in California but not enough to close the projected one point seven million. Shortfall of graduates that we are going to need. In some ways the good news is more and more Californians are ready to go to college want to go to college. Have completed the a through G. requirements so that they can get to college. And yet we continue to turn away eligible students at the UC and the CSU. Every single day including today because we don't funds are universities enough to. Take them all. In nineteen ninety five about thirty five percent of high school graduates completed a through G. those are the courses that you need. To get to college. Today aye that number has increased significantly to a record forty four percent. But there's huge inequality when you breakdown that figure by race in fact white students completed a through G. by forty almost fifty percent but Latino students only thirty five percent of high school seniors who graduate that are like the you know can even apply to you Sierra CSU. And only thirty three percent of black students can apply to use your CSU. That's unacceptable. The other thing that's honored that unacceptable or the enrollment cap set by the master plan. We've said that only the top third of Californians should go to you Sierra CSU campus. That worked for the nineteen sixties but not for today when more and more jobs require that students actually have a college education. So. My ask to you as that you left the enrollment caps at the UC in the CSU. It should not be harder for our kids to get into college than it was for us. Especially since this economy practically requires a college education. The limits of the master plan enrollment caps and inadequate funding for CSU and you see forced many students to attend community college first with the hopes of transferring. To complete a bachelor's degree. Unfortunately the route from community colleges to four year universities is much more of a Mayes than a straight forward passed away as you already heard from our to student leaders here. Although a majority of community college students in roll. Out with the goal of transferring only four percent. Only four percent do so within two years. And only thirty eight percent after six years. Transfer students will take six point four years to earn a bachelor's degree at the UC. And seven years at the CSU. That results in an additional thirty six to thirty thousand dollars in expenses for transfer students compared to freshmen admits. The transfer process is broken in California due to the lack of coordination between the segments. California's also unique in its lack of a statewide official or entity that insurers are various segments have to work together. More seamlessly. Such an entity must have the responsibility authority capacity staff and financial. A resources to be effective in advancing a state agenda. For California not an agenda for the UC. Not an agenda for the CSU not an agenda for community colleges. An agenda for California and its students. That agenda should be to increase college access attainment rates to improve transfer and close the equity gaps. We need an entity that keeps the interest of students on the state at the center of any conversation between the segments. The C. S. you in the UC offer their own version of admission guarantees and two different sets of lower division general ed requirements first transfer students. In twenty ten as you know the campaign for college opportunity sponsored legislation to establish the associate degrees for transfer. Which offer seamless one hundred twenty unit passed a bachelors degree. Students earning this associate degree for transfer guaranteed admission to the C. S. you with junior standing. And a bachelors degree with for ways to guarantee that they won't have to complete more than sixty units. There are now eighty tease in thirty two majors with college is still developing these programs and we're starting to see the impact. I just want to share one statistic students that transfer to a CSU with an associate degree. Actually earned that bachelor's degree forty eight percent faster that students that transfer the traditional way. They earn it out of twenty seven percent rate. There are a lot of efforts to expand the ADT program and we support them including those efforts to align with the western governors us university. And also with historically black colleges and universities across the state. But we need to make sure that we continue to maintain that promise and expanded everywhere. Are there other means through which we fail to design colleges for student success it's often lamented that many students are not college ready when stepping onto campus. But we must also be Frank and asking if colleges consistently prove themselves to be student ready. Alejandro already talked about remedial education so I'm not going to go into that. But we also sponsored assembly bill seven oh five to ensure that colleges could use more than just the assessment test. To place students by one of your colleagues Jacqui Irwin. I'm. Guided pathways is also another means to shape college practices to make sure that more students get to their goals and reach their dreams. As previously mentioned most students come man with the goal of transferring and yet there Matt with a lot of confusion. Last year we actively supported the state budget investment of a hundred and fifty million budget allocation to expand guided pathways in community colleges. And. You know it's called guided pathways but it simply common sense. Students should arrive in college and not have to gas how they might pull off transfer or get a certificate or degree. On March fifth a. We are going to release left out how exclusion in California's colleges and universities. Hurts our values our students and our economy. This report analyzes the leadership faculty academic Senate diversity by race and gender of our community colleges. And universities. While that next students now composed forty three percent of our undergrads and black students another six percent of a room in California. Only twelve percent of faculty members across our colleges and universities are Latin at. Only five percent are black. Leadership roles are still highly exclusive with whites comprising sixty percent of senior leadership roles in higher education. More than sixty percent of our faculty over seventy percent of campus academic Senate's. And over eighty percent of the systemwide academic senates across our community colleges and universities are white. As leaders who care about improving student outcomes and closing racial gaps in it inequality in our own state. Let we share that there is no way to do that without ensuring greater inclusivity in our campuses. You heard from both our students Manuel and I'll handle about the importance of seeing themselves in the leaders in front of them. All students white black Latin next Asian American. Benefit from being exposed to the diversity that has made California strong. As policymakers I urge you to require community colleges and universities to collect and report data by race of their leaders and academic Senate's. They're only required to do it for faculty and students that's. Not not. We're all urged governor and the Senate. Many. To. See region. See. Please. Anchor college governor. Refer the population diversity of California. And. Of the number of women in our state. I just want to share a few stats that you'll get to see on Tuesday. The UC regents has twenty six members only seven women. Sixty two percent are white. The CSU board of trustees. Thirty five percent women. Seventy percent white. The community college board of governors. Forty one percent women. Seventy seven percent white. We are the sixth largest economy in the world we're not gonna maintain that standing or that force. If we leave people out if we don't close the racial gaps that persist and if we don't. Just talk about how progressive we are as a Californians but act on it. The California dream is premised on the idea that any of us can imagine and create a brighter future. Well only honor the dream by ensuring our children can partake in the same opportunities. That past generations were able to. You started this hearing by talking about the promise. Promise as a noun means a commitment to do something. I urge you to use it as a verb. Which means you will do something. Thank you. Thank you very much Michelle and and next been during an exam director Central Valley hired. Consortium. Thank you. Okay ó whole life trying to find this worse for them. The. Other. I'm trying to shut it out Choi. So it was all were different in this. I was around in the sixties aye Nguyen. I remember the sixties. Great time hit hit hit hit. Number all over that for those of them who reap with for the part of the six if you can remember. Shop from the Central Valley higher education consortium and I came today. Ought to talk to you about equity and about student success and when we talk about equity. And ski and wood shop arrow my going to do. Up when I start talking about equity and student success what we're talking about is truly. Are. The fact the third but the two are married. Have a good friend of mine who says everybody is everybody. All is all. We don't do cold porch we don't so so much tell you about what we're doing in the Central Valley. The Central Valley who are weeks of the Central Valley is a is a group of of colleges and universities all from Stockton all the way down to of Kern county from some walking calmly. Down the Kern county which fourteen community colleges. For community college district offices. The three California state universities in the in the region. It includes the university of California the tenth floor campus of the camp of the of the system and that concludes five of our independent colleges and universities. In the valley. So we come together to single voice and it's a unique organization in that in that our board of directors of the president's and the and the chances. Of the institutions so that we get when we come together. We come together we strive speak with one voice up what you look at what we have listed here when I have listed here. Are a number of partners that were for we've been partnering with here in the Central Valley to bring student success and equity because we think. That you have to be equally given the equal and inclusive then it's got to be student success across the board right it can't just be some other so the sunlight up. Because I'm mindful of the time also so but. Back in twenty sixteen. Our board of directors for the directors had a had a some in fact up in fact assemblyman. Arambula was there any like all fired up because we were showing data we were showing data that was very very specific. About what we needed to do as as colleges and universities and Central Valley to lift all of our youngsters. Again equity to bring them all up and so there are there are a number of things set that came out of that summit that I wanted to talk about so the first strategy. The first strategy that we're doing across the board we're trying to scale this thing up across the board is a co requisite remediation. End up with color called correct with a real patient different folks college different things but tell you what it is in the second. That's correct with the remediation and mathematics and English. What we know? What we know is that when young people? Get stuck at the gateway at the community colleges we have this this huge group of students. Who get to the gateway to transfer and never do? Ninety two percent of them never transfer because they can't get past college algebra the couldn't get past that great and in time is a problem. Because if you're in the community because of just state of another here another year and a half two years. Them start losing folks there's a study from the public policy institute of California. That tells us that in it when they studied the Inland Empire Los Angeles and the Central Valley. That in a five year period. Now get this. So for this support for the for the legislators on my couch we spent all that money and we really didn't get anywhere. Three hundred thousand students. Got to the gateway. And that were crossed into transfer. That was an a five year period for just those threes those three years of of California she can imagine. What's going on in the rest of the state so that it's an equity right medicine benefit right that isn't okay four four X. number students to get there and not be able to get into the. Promised land do not be able to get to get the to cross that to cross over. So our colleges and universities are implementing cho requisite remediation on hunter spoke to the bed. And and. And and about this notion about Hey how do we place students of. The assembly passed AB seven forty spend referenced a number of times today. Awe and then and then chancer Tim why. Did this really gutsy thing and he signed an executive order. Requiring multiple measures also at the California State University system so now in the California State University system. And in the community colleges there is a quick requirement for placing students and these gateway courses. Using multiple measures but but as a result of that ins and that CSU they're also be required to implement co requisite we. And the community colleges are moving along here in the valley we have a movement where these colleges are taking call represent remediation at scaling that up. And what that means is that just very simply for those of you don't understand it so let's take English one a. So those of you who were a lot smarter than me would've taken English one. And taken a three uniclass bang that out and gone through. For those people that were not as well prepared you would take it and probably didn't passed. Or you or worse yet no worship worship you would get in there you take a placement exam and they would tell you because it's a. Are your three levels below college ready so that means you have to take semester one semester to semester three. Before you even got into English one a which was no guarantee that you're going to pass English when I. We go on and on and on you can see that you can see the quagmire right. With co requisite remediation you're placed. Along with the other folks in English when a but instead of whoever died and said you can on you know you'll have take English. Three hours a week. There are some of us who need five hours a week right so there there may be that the regular three English three hours of English actor taking with everyone else. And the additional two hours might be spent. Might be spent on to it onto Tauriel on as an additional assistance to make sure that you get through because the course that you're taking has the exact same rigor. Has excel set require the same requirements as the other folks who got placed in there. So when we when we look at the data that's what when assemblyman Arambula when you look at the things about why are we doing this well. And and what's true right so what work so we are trying to scale that appear in the Central Valley so that when young people get into college. Given to the community colleges the third ever take or the CSU now that they literally are able to get through the gate we courses and then get on get on a with life. So that's that's one of the things that we're doing here in the Central Valley the other one is fifty to finish such as that. I under spoke to it and and he said you know. There are some folks who can't do it and that's true what we don't want to do it you don't want to diminish those folks. Who can't attend school time I'm a school full time there are folks who can't go to school full time we understand that? But we also understand I think Debbie Cochran mentioned when you look at the research the research says. Students who are going to school full time. By completing and the clean completing faster. Time is a horrible but can you imagine if we could get kids risk through through university through the communicative university in four four and a half years five years Max. Versus seven or eight. Can you much of the savings to the state of California that we could direct to other things that we do so well our our recommendation is that we one of the recommendations would be. Are giving back to the co requisite remediation that since it's now becoming a part of what's what what is transforming the colleges is that. We really look at a professional learning and opportunities for folks as we as we. Are are faculties are being asked to change the very way they do what they do. Off after having done things one way for a long time and it'll take awhile to two one. To implement these things so we look at fifteen to finish what we're trying to get young people to not only up. Get full to get their financial aid and you've heard all about minutes allowing you to that. Get all the financial aid get the benefits from that from both services the county another sort of things. To give you the opportunity to attend full time if you possibly if you possibly can are others are other strategies that would be a recommendation is that the legislature seriously to take a look. At a LA longitudinal data sharing platform. That would allow us to share clout a data from the other que que arcade twelve partners to the community college to see if you can the CSU. Right now their individual their individual cycles that exist out there and it doesn't make any sense to us and it's difficult for us to get that data if we can follow kid. From from the six grade through the high school into the community college. And and literally have the parents also following by by the way by have the parents follow have the students follow we can do that there are there are there it's out there it's simply a matter. Of of doing that. And then the other strategies egg and you've heard the other efforts to to guided pathways. So we're implementing guided pathways across across the valley all of our colleges and universities including our our CSU do you see where all and are independent of France. All are are all picking up the the guided pathways because I think all I think senator of senator Alben spoke about the wraparound services. But the university of California kids get. Which is wonderful but again everybody is everybody in all it's all. So it's not good for you see kids why isn't a good for like other kids right so with with what the four pillars with the four pillars of. Of book of love of guided pathways so one doesn't take. The not caring getting through and get in them and it didn't take into other hunter spoke about. Going through these these horrible website and tried to so of getting kids to and the other thing that's what you've got no man has to get up to select a path I'm Amanda major. A direction in which they're going to go the other one and then another pillars to literally literally give them the intrinsic student services we heard about one two three thousand of its counselor. Student ratio twenty fifteen hundred to really literally put some services to some dollars fifty for like recommendations up. Up with respect to retrieve sixteen services to make sure that the students. At the community colleges. For instance are getting both her parents for Mrs that the kids at the university of California and then the other is the one I was talking about awhile ago. Which is the wrapped the up the professional learning to make sure that learning this taking place and that faculty are given an opportunity for professional learning. Do you know I used ice to be a K. twelve god I suggest you pretended by school district before I went to the communicative. I used to more professional development and training with my K. twelve teachers. They're not our community college folks ever got. Does it make any sense. So I mean work so anyway. That's what we are that's what we're doing here in the Central Valley and we're doing it because we believe first I missed Medina. Thank you. Mister chair so I am assembly member Jose Medina. I represent. Another part of the in that part of the state of California. I represent the Inland Empire riverside Moreno valley and the city of Paris. Similar to the area where we are right now we have a very low. College going rate. I think that with the Central Valley the Inland Empire the Lois college going rate in the state of California. I was around in the sixties. Matter of fact in nineteen sixty eight I I was a freshman in high school. So I I sure that with the doctor do not. And I say that because I was also a history teacher. Today in the capital we did a press conference. To date March first. Thousand. Eighteen is the fiftieth anniversary. The fiftieth anniversary. Of walkouts that took out took place in Los Angeles walkouts that I. Might. Think that Alejandro and Manuel may not be familiar with. Wild cards. Ed at Lincoln High School our field high school Roosevelt high school. Led by a teacher. Sal Castro. The teacher who I had the opportunity to meet. I had the opportunity to bring to my classroom. It you gotta studies. My gonna studies classroom in the high school and I bring it up because I heard a the handle and men will talk about. The importance of teachers and counselors that look like that. Like students and I bring it up because I here Michelle seek ghettos. Talking about. Our students still not being admitted I hear Michelle talking about. Faculty not looking like the students not not been enough Latino faculty not having enough. Latino administrators not having enough Latinos on the regions of the UC. On the board of trustees of the CSU of the. Community college. And guess what. Those demands of those students fifty years ago. Are the same things that we are talking about today. The same things those were the issues that those students talked about exact the same things. So I I don't say that to discourage us. I actually say that we need their energy. The energy that those students have and I. Think we do have a. Right alone. And they were successful. Even though here we are fifty years later and we're talking about some of the. Things that we don't have they were actually were successful. They they change a culture in Los Angeles. Where? No one really expected. Us. Latinos to go to college the change that they turned around and they did it dramatically. In the number of students that they were able to change they affected. Us a movement. That. Change now. That made it possible for me to be in the state legislature. Right aye think they created a movement that that every single Latino who's ever served in the state legislature. Up close. So. But. I I think it's it's good that we take a moment to reflect on that. And also do use their example to do better. Because. Even though there is much that that we need to improve the lot. There is never been a time where we've had more Latinos in higher education more Latinos in you see or Latinos and see issue. And and I will quote. Sal Castro. And I will quote would settle Castro said when he came to my cast my classrooms. Nosair been they hope. If you knew Sau Castro that's who he talked. You don't go to college. And about the bottleneck in community college I was a community college trustee for thirteen years. But it's clear it's obvious that. Something's gone wrong with community college if the majority of Latinos. Who are in community colleges are not being able to? Go to four year colleges you know I went to college. My daughter graduated from U. S. C. on a graduate of UC riverside. We both got out in four years and that's because we both had the opportunity to you to be full time students. And not have to worry about a lot of the things that I've heard the students in the first panel have to worry about. But that is what college is meant to be I think college and we as a state a California. Need to do better. I chair the committee on higher education I am the subcommittee. Of on the budget for higher education it is disgraceful. I think it is disgraceful the. Amount of money that we invest in higher education and so I make the point that at the time were there are the most Latinos. Ever in the history of California and higher education it is disgraceful that we kind a nickel and dime higher education. I think we were probably teaching to the you know preaching to the choir here with my colleagues but. It's up to you. Its up to you as students to put pressure. On us to do better so thank you. The user Medina. And the other are questions or comments from colleagues. I know nobody it's it's hard to follow Mr Medina. The Mister member has the guts to. I think you can see why we call them out profit. You know I wanted to comment to Manuel if I could. I was impressed with your courage and humility. And it reminds me. My rates as well. My father used to pick grapes in Pixley and I was born in Delano so I know make far lent. And you are right. That if you come from a humble place it's our responsibility to turn around and make sure work holding that door open for future generations. And I was really proud of you today in your ability to speak to. To that because. Thank you doctor Arambula. And with that. I think we're going to wrap up this panel. And move on that. Public comment. Thank you very much everybody for participating. So now there were thirty five minutes behind schedule. This is the opportunity for public comment thank you everyone for your patience and I can with us. So far. We've allotted technically thirty five minutes to public comment. But really as much time as as for everyone to be heard. Those if we check and see if the microphone is on and we left it off testing perfect thank you. So. The we ask a speakers to love themselves to one to two minutes of possible. In your comments so that we can hear from as many folks as possible thank you for your understanding. And let me also to say of please by if you're in the audience and you want to. Follow along on that the efforts of the select committee on the master plan. And participate in future hearings don't hesitate to reach out to my legislative director Alan green. Of Israeli here in income and and introduce yourself and give your contact information balance. After the hearing will make sure that your pride on our email distribution list so you're kept up to date on what we're working on. So that takes care that. And. With that I'm going to. Open a public comment with. And I apologize for. Minutemen until. Venancio gallon I'm. A Latino education and. Issues roundtable perfect Venancio. When I started it's good I would evening. Thank you Mister Berman I'm blah honorable Pahlavi articles. Senator Allen. Mr Medina. Which other artists forces common values thank you very much for your comments. A lot of a ground has been covered our organization has here six. Six for six comments we're gonna try to look I'm gonna try to limit it to three. First of all. Senate bill fourteen forty was passed in. The year two thousand ten. It established a student transfer achievement Reform Act sixty units to be. Stone to be eligible to be accepted up or year CSU system. Somehow some way. Institutions community colleges did not include. Say for example. Ethnic studies Chicano Latino studies so Senate Billboard for forty was passed. Senate for forty says required the creation of for transfer model curriculum templates. That allow students a broader area of study than previously available to other associate degrees for transfer. It was passed in two thousand thirteen yet some community colleges. We need accountability from you Mr Medina said. That community colleges pass implement this bill. And not say all students are not interested in Chicano Latino studies are not in ruling because not part of the sixty transfer units. You need to tell them have you implemented what is already on the books. Recommendation to. The master plan comments have been made especially by missing Kato's and others. About. Affirmative action which I call permitted action in the hiring. We have institutions that four year colleges. A nearby use CSU. That says it all well are. We have to have. Only ten year. Teachers. Tenured professors on the screening committee that's not fair that's not equity. You need across it you can't have just one let the you know oh one African American serving on all the screening committees because he or she is the only one. With that degree. That is tenure. Finally. The request. Last February seventh. Senator Hueso held. A yeah. Provided the community this the majority report. Sacramento the Sheraton hotel. I encourage you. Especially you assemblyman. I number now if you could hold this this report. Published by the education trust west. Have it. Hell here just like we thank you very much for the fact that you had this hearing here. I no you listen to us because we recommended that you bring this here. We hope that you come back. And that you have many more hearings because there are a lot of concerns. Finally I like to reiterate that comment that was made earlier by cicadas and Mister that on. We need also representation from the valley on the CSU the UC system and especially the community college or a board of governors. A board of regents and the trustees thank you very much. Thank you can also. And next up is Medellin Louden you see S. B. lobby core. The reading. I was a little bit about my background. School and my title years of living up. Where other read and write to the? This is a topic that I've been with me through it. Unfortunately for some time before it hits college and I saw that it. It a lot more students than I was used to. Irvine. I really affluent area where this is under wraps nobody knew that any of this going on. Any friend. As a junior in high school I had say give my mom money that it. A job orders to cover right. I and my senior year as my situation I got words. And conversations of evictions turned into threats at least coming through it or having a struggle with looking for it. I've the future and I barely nearly gave it up to a. I didn't I. Here and now. One I attended UCSB I was fortunate enough to qualify for how come. And was able to have a more stable and wood living situation that approved. Which as Tim had mentioned in the previous an awful lot of students experience. Either way. But that's just it I you know my securities based on the amount of ability. I of financial aid. Cited by. Leaders which. Apparently. My well being is based on the funding an expert programs and services on campus such as mental health. Sexual assault resources food banks campus health centers and countless other programs. That are suppose to be available to students. Weekly different backgrounds and our various groups on campus. I from my experience however lobbying in Sacramento many legislators have expressed mistrusted states. With working with the UC system to address funding excuse which are separate and said the success. And experience but students here at UC system. While I understand the reasoning behind it a very. It is very difficult to not feel as if they're true archer realizing her experience troubles as students. I just as they can push it aside as he is trying to get involved in about it that they don't. That they don't understand these conversations. When in reality every single student I talked to understand it much better. That people up in the level exact. These are the lives they live there not story can be out. And that's why I'm here today IV drip from Senate barber looked at five in the morning. You're all day and we're in mid terms. Really. A very interesting times to leave to go to com. But I'm here today to ask you to take your afraid to step are they not just listen to our voices. And to not their interests ten years from now with the renewal of the master plan. I would actively fight for the needs of college students on housewares in a committee meetings and in your districts and to enact real change. I think he's. Thank you know. And next of his mere. So Valley health. Need and thank you for. Holding this committee hearing here I live in Fresno of our organization is headquartered in Sacramento and I can tell you many times I have to travel to Los Angeles o'quinn for Sacramento. To attend meetings where I learned about the issues we here in the Central Valley say really appreciate you being here today. And I represent the Central Valley health network which is a consortium of fourteen community health centers so I don't working education but we do a lot of work around work force and while I recognize the committee had a hearing. In San Jose around work force I still think that we want to bring home the fact that meeting the needs of students also means making sure. That the programs that exist in our education our going to prepare those students for terminal degrees or certificates that provide them with the skills and knowledge that they need. To get living wage career jobs so often we hear about students especially in the valley UC Merced graduates at Sandra. That are having to take minimum wage jobs on in places like target or Taco Bell and places like that. I'm and so we will feel that and we need to focus on problematically. Something that we take into consideration as well I mean that the cost of education should not outweigh the wages that these students are going to be receiving when they enter the workforce. And saddling them with such dad. And doctor regular you know the shortage of. Health professionals that we have here in the Central Valley on as well as Mr Medina you have the same thing in the Inland Empire and I in the. UC riverside along as well so. Exactly and and so we have seen that the impact that that has on our ability to attract and retain. Even positions in this area because they can go to other areas and make more money in order to pay off that student debt. I also want to talk real quickly about partnerships I keep with a colleague and we've had that workforce leans on because that's our work. But what we were sitting here she had to leave she made the suggestion that is you look at things like behavioral health and and the shortage of. And that high ratio of counselors to students when not tap into partners in the community such as the federally qualified health centers. To have behavioral health services and other services that they're providing to the communities they're very closely located in many cases to the universities and maybe if they collaborate together a group of them. Along with the education system bill might be able to help meet some of those needs without just fully rely on the government. So again thank you. Thank you and much. Next up is doctor Joseph Jones followed by Lucy Ruiz. Thank you all for given the opportunity I just felt that. I have a responsibility to be say something. I that may be missing out of president of Fresno Pacific university. And what at first I'm new to the state when I came. I was told that. It the grand plan of California which is best educate. Was a poor legacy do you all have for it this. The at community colleges. It's the I see it you see. And the independence. And so as we're looking at this massive and I'm hoping. That we don't forget IV independence I have to look in terms of just the data twenty two percent of the bachelor degrees. Awarded in the state come from the independence to about seventy eight of us. You six fifty four percent I think it's fifty to a fifty four percent of the mask agrees I come from the independence. Fifty four percent. Of the five doctors coming from being Vincent back about what happens when the independence. May have become. Stifle or handicapped in some way and quite often they are not matches in bachelor programs are supported by what what comes. On. The. Back to list programs missiles with thinking about innocent of higher education. We have worked on outcomes we are really precious about outcome students don't come to us I just because of nay become to us four. Dozen outcomes we have Fresno Pacific we have a four year guarantee. If you don't do it for years and we have all of wraparound service you don't go in for years. Three for Yasser that we've been working with this compact. About a two year guarantee and we met with the presidents of the community colleges without even working with Fresno state. Up a little when I hear became having more acid down with president would aye Joseph. What can we do we appear to actually do something and work in the valley? Nine five percent of our student body a California residents yes a young aye ninety two percent of those students are act or scholarship fifty four percent of Boston. Come from families of forty on with incomes of less of forty thousand so population is not much different and if you look at the. I'll be independence sixty percent of the population students of color and and Fresno Pacific sixty two percent. A lot population students of color subpopulations out much different music and we haven't had to work very hard to act and make sure that. Obvious dot Carlock. Return on investment we greatly appreciate. And the support of the cal grants are but of one of the things that really appreciate when I'm here because there is. And now causes the universe is. Coming together and act of talk about how can we are to have any impact. On this ballot. Up for the students that I in this valley we have regional campus I'm biggest buildup to Merced. So how can we have to work together I do do that and not trying to are compete globally working up the have impact. I think that. As you think about the master plan on who else is doing it yeah I guess of new. But I think it's a great idea if you really are trying to have. Impact on education I also this and I'll and I'll the yeah I worked in the I would be a city. Feel just as I was a professor in that particular field by working I feel years as always thinking a reason why I've connected with education and just. By the up you'll probably have seen the reports because it came from legislative legislative analyst's. Report says that it's over seventy thousand dollars a year. Fought in makes in prison. That's what we're spent. So as we think about education and investing. Well we should be acting up be reluctant at in terms of how we are looking at the list wraparound services it we need all over. Actually students at the retain graduate income I can get a job and start businesses and invest in. And the state and so I just want you to remember. We ought independence seventy. We have capacity will read that really to go to part with all of the. See if you. The community colleges and is the thank you. Think. You got to Jones makes it will lose you moody's. That followed by Amelia Medina. Thank you chair Berman obviously I'm not loosing. Although confused that he was going to put I mean down. Put her on me and I I want to take this opportunity first and foremost Israel has no you are. John Leo fees eight center community college trustee the user last year. I want to thank welcome home. Dr Arambula and I want to a welcome and thank you for being here. For this very important session and I know that you we've had a lot of information I'm only here to echo and support all of our speakers. And we have a chance to here we have a doctor go goldsmith here community college president we are working to other. Here with others in a in the consortium to improve our situation you've heard all the facts and figures. And we just hope that you will act upon that. And again thank you for coming thank all of you for participating. And I really appreciate it thank you thank you very much. Next we in the million Martinez followed by just heard. De she's meet Justin WCO. Hello my name is an idea or. And. I'm first generation second year student you see I. Saw before I continue on a shadow. And I am you know I think credit should be given god is doing a thing. Something's politicians don't get to have the best route but I I think you've been a great advocate for us we really appreciate that. Site she missed that along with other students we missed a day of lecture during week eight to be here. Arm so I really hope that what I'm about to say it's not just another comment that you hear and they forget about it. Because plus to be here we had to drive about. So. Mattress yeah you see. You see I I worked three jobs to make sure I wouldn't have to take out any loans. I was a full time student and I also chair for center Cunningham Leyva enables her staff to make sure I always see it was her staff to show me what loans where. We do have an online training program we to go alone but it's. It's nine up there needs to be more. It one of her staff members actually graduate from you see I saw was her on the with me about. Things that I needed to do to find different resources I think. You know that shows that we have a long way to to me students need done their respective campuses. I'm Matt now second year I figure some things out like part thirty park twenty minutes away so you pay less for parking. Join the team that ambassadors so they'll give you dying dollars so you can save some money on food. Going to add at high speeds vote class account and try to find that the tide of your books before anyone else can so you can find the book at the library and scanned. So you don't have to pay for them share the clickers with fancy don't have to pay the fifty to seventy five dollars keep for them and hope you get caught doing so. Because you're supposed to eat registered only one click a per person. Yeah and US government relations director at high to make it upon myself to make sure that I every lobby core meeting. We have food so the students participating ABA. Some of them get at least one good meal an entire week. I shouldn't have to do that. Because you know as tuition increase says we have a. We have a proposed tuition increase vote coming up in. I fishing increases fewer students from low income backgrounds apply even when they are eligible for financial aid. That thing about low income students is that we need so much more than just. Financial way there's so many things that comes with fees according travel up to get there I commute for forty minutes if my parents had only their car I wouldn't be able to make it to you see I. So there's so much more things than needs to be done and I think. I think this is a first grade staff I am happy that this is something that would going and I hope moving forward it continues with even more momentum day house right now because I. This should be packed. And. Yeah I I think there's something that needs to be done either from you all or I don't know anyone else but some things to be done to. To be able to give a stipend or something to students to make it out to do things like this because it is difficult for us to to do this. I'm not I think we have a key for other things that we ourselves experience. So. You know somethings from ya to have us at the table. I know you've heard this all before. And I know this process is long I know that's that thing in politics but please Piper this like your career depends on it. It the state of California has achieved unbelievable any times in your on no that is. We'd take risk when no one else dares to we think yes we can and yes we welcome people shy away. This is the Californians very and we don crazy things before. Funding all students should not be something that which I away from. All over the state students have that done in this time thank you continue to join us. Thank you they you million. Next it was just and honest you know. Followed by pearl Flores. Forgive me if I ramble of it aye Andrew over three hundred. Four hours of sleep to get. So little packet of this coffee in the back. Yeah. No who. So little background on me I. And. There. I. Came here I was really interested in this. I was I'm student I lived under. A pass of the fifteen. For several years because my parents were drug at. And I was holding first grade. Again in fifth grade again and eleventh grade that college wasn't. And that was something that I really internalized M.. And it really her and I never thought I would be at a you see and I would be if. Student leader. But here I am. One of the things that I think is important to know is that we do have a seat here funding issue. When I hear a tuition increases and then I look at like the sea otter reportedly I see office of the president I get extremely fast. Because I have to make that choice in order to come here I'd exhaust. The cast. And we're actually Kiley rented aye aye. Absolutely exhausted my bank account to get here today. So it's really hard for me. Knowing that I'm not. We able. And when I get frustrated when aye we to get food or other resources. Yes I get will growl. And I look at myself and I realize I'm one of the lucky so I was a C. C. transparent. Aye was one of the lucky ninety two percent that actually got through. I'm in the reason why as I took seventeen to twenty five units every quarter. Or every semester. She Dillon roll into community colleges in order to I'm over an admissions. Because I have and taking care my grandma who is can't. And I understood that if I didn't get my I agree I would be. And it's so when you're looking at legislation I urge you to remember that all of you all most likely have always had act. Those you will never know the shame and degradation going into first grade being taken very ending. That was my first real experience that happened again in third and fourth grade and it was awful. And so coming to from a place about a lack of privilege it means a lot to be able to speak up and actually look at. Senator for example in the eye and say Hey this is me this is my name and I. And then the closing remark that I would really like to make is. I don't know if I necessarily agree with a point made about fifteen to graduate plan and the only reason that I do I disagree with that. I work extensively everything psycho need seventy miles because I do not. They riverside area. I was almost home once again by my best friend and her family took me and so I was able to. Live album in a very comfortable house duration but it's. Everyday I how did your on him I going to eat warming up he began. And then when they get to school I work twelve to fifteen hour days every single day sometimes I get home at three or four in the morning. And have to week of ATM and we go back. So that's about a two hour drive his single day. Really exhausting I don't get any additional support. And I'm lucky if my financially coverage even a fraction of any of the cost. Especially because my car is eighteen years old I had a secret for years to Alaska hundred dollars. A paper. I'm an attack breaks down then high have. I one of the lucky slick think about the person and I am lucky there so many students that have the exact same story the exact same Akram. That aren't as lucky that will never ever get to step out on use. It's I really want children think about that when you look at budgets and release that were more than just. Just. Next with a pro of was followed by LEN inquiry. Good evening everyone and first of all I wanted to think. Fresno City College for having is here and actually everyone is in this room like I'd like to thank you. Because it means a lot to not just me but every person here is here for a reason and they know that together we're gonna stand and fight for what we believe. So my name is Philip Florence and I'm a missionary Xin first year student at the university of California riverside. And is a psychology major I've always wanted to make a difference in the world but. I get there I have to call. And. Financially that makes it very difficult. If tuition was to go out I'd be forced to get their job to pay off my. My parents can help me with money because in the end I'm actually hoping that. Then I'm not unemployed because they choose to. My mother has the duty to take care my youngest five year old sister. And my. Father suffers from a disability and due to racism in his workplace my father has been unjustly rocked of money like not being paid overtime. When he works it. And as a little girl I was never really able to see my father. And he would always leave it don early morning and arrived very late and when you're little you tend to sleep early. And sometimes I remember I would always way at night image that his dad coming home. Centers like no he has to stay over there at work. And sometimes I made it even harder to for me because I wouldn't even seem on weekends. Now. And he worked excessively basically to support the life of the skits. And now I'm paying off college on my own and trying to support my family this. Raising tuition would force me to take a job that would take away the time I need to study and do other work. Such as like internships or being here. I am sure I'm not the only student you've heard with the story. But I know we all have a bunch of potential and all we ask is not. And hard. The. People. Next up we're letting Cooley a fall by Tom who. Good evening everyone. Or express my sincere gratitude to on presence on sit on the city community college. I'm Fred I'm not only I think we've been able to have this kind of meeting also having students come to present. A book during a public forum on my name is on legislative your current. The number is an eleven including. Apparently if pursue political science major at university called for your riverside. Before I begin I want to ask every respective committee members to imagine a life where a college education and is. Deemed as unattainable simply due to economic status. Once which is the reality for many students across see UC and CSU system arm including myself coming from the home of immigrants the topic of on. Immigrants from was who other medical. The topic of a college education would always often of one. On to postpone the conversation about. Affording to pay for one. It was from a young age that I quickly up with knowledge that a college education was needed for social mobility to break the cycle financial information. I'm I'm here today not only to represent them the minority once on this kind of issue. But specifically use yours with the next on student population who do not have the privilege of presenting a fund fine folk here today. Cho in the little over then little over than fifty bombs fifty percent of you see our students receive the program however is still report understood large through external publishes report that their food and secure. Specifically because the public doesn't cover for things such as books etcetera. During my little time at UC riverside being in government. Relations assistant director of had the opportunity to what externally outside of you see riverside and within the seize riverside student population I'm having students come up to me and tell me that. On the fact that they have to skip meals in order to buy books on the fact that was a lot of students are homeless and didn't have anywhere to. To go during the summer it said a little little over little weak winter breaks. With kindest heart mean and it makes you run Billy second guess what. Where are Senate of senator members what are the assembly members doing to make sure that? Students are represented and to have to go to do this kind of struggles. As a minority voice I call the committee not only to focus our efforts to create a high. Headmaster plan that addresses student basic needs one that provides equity for students of color think. Even. Tom moved be followed by Taylor Chumley. Good afternoon chairman and members my name's Tom for them with the association of in the California colleges and universities say I see see you. How we are the organizational boys for seventy eight private prop colleges and universities? Let me just many move. Right about it. I just want to quickly touch on a couple of things. This past Tuesday we had ours annual student lobby day. And we were joined by president Jones but he just laughed. We over a hundred twenty cal grant students from across the state came up to the capitol to meet with legislators and or staff. About the points of. The cow when work and the points of maintaining it at nine thousand eighty four. The award has not seen increase since two thousand. And the has actually decreased by thirty five percent. Over the last decade due to inflation and also cuts. As tickets noted. The cal grant is an integral part of access and success especially for first generation students and students from disadvantaged communities. From. The cabin students in the nonprofit sector a do extremely well. There they have a sixty two percent four year graduation rate. At in the nonprofit sector. I think this exemplifies the wraparound services that president Jones mentioned in when he was up here. That are nonprofit college can provide to struggling students. We're grateful that the world will not be cut this year. But we just want to know that is stable and hopefully increasing. Cal grant award. Will help students access and succeed. In the nonprofit sector of the second point very quickly. A I see see you is working on a. Variation of the associate degree for transfer program. That would create a strong transparent pathway for transfer students. To access. More options. When they look at what they want transfer and that we hope that you can support that this year thank you. Seventy which only fall back. Dinesh. Can quickly as the last man died. Possibly. To have all those most. Intimate. No to. Dinesh. Yeah they were the last manager might. Be dashed big bash aye match. Five. Well another. But high ambition I a good evening out on the legislative director from the student union assembly. On how you see senators that are sitting government body. And so I was already thinking the committee members were here today particularly. Assembly member. I had the option to speak in front of you at the assembly sub you budget hearing last week and diets. One person you hear once again fighting for students and on behalf. But. Yeah well I don't to drove you know three hours with my peers to get here I am here. And I'm here at this hearing because I could afford to me right I'm privileged enough to be here to be able to skip class. To not rely on minimum wage jobs to for my tuition I'm in my basic needs but. We also to remember that there were folks who couldn't be here today we have to remember that so some folks were two sometimes three jobs and are enrolled as full or part time students. Here within the you see who couldn't be here because they can't just work. What class? It's important also recognize what all of us to do therefore get in return. For the work be putting. Within this broken system that to stay within it. We sure hope that this hearing several two sticks backing up this narrative about you know lack of resources lack of basic needs and those statistics represent us but. They're also you know representative real students real stories and a total lack of access to affordable housing and food. So just budget is six rate you see things home to the fort worth small city in the. U. S. were renters we do not have a designated. Site for. Housing are libertarian Regis defenders of not spent but tuitions as well as I'm just of actions are moon plans are expensive our food pantries under are underfunded. So what do all of us what we want greater state investment. In all areas of public education and this committee albeit you know a small step is a step in the right direction. But it will only mean something if it's efforts are continuous and center student voices and I can't emphasize that enough so I'm to all of you to carefully listen to the student stories. Take them to heart understand that there is a lot of emotional and physical labor put into coming here. And to work to change the pope deplorable state of our current. Thank you. And next up we have. Who? We their. Some love Mister or Mrs Elliott. To have an. What is it? Cameron thank you Cameron followed by Alison lira. You guys for coming. I think it'll be here got us out of. Enhance higher education. As a collective. From by scantily I'm a first year student. I see senators I'm a part of the student union the. DR student I UC Santa Cruz. I'm as big has said. We're all provision of to be here. And so afford to miss a day of school. And not have to worry. To pay tuition. I mean that's can attain for me it will soon hereby. Yeah. Was brought up earlier was that. The state Senate more students I understand this. Transfer students are not transferring. To. Bob for universities. Because. It's there is not space. But. A problem. You see senators I capacity. Like in every way shape and form. Buses are. Till date leave the station but our. Without admitting every student who was waiting at the bus stop suits have to wait longer. Classes are completely full since who needs to take directors instead declare majors. Cannot do that and as a result or staying for longer than four years at the institute. Yes and the solution to this. Is the bottom. Simply find the university system. The way it should be. I was brought up earlier as well. Was an emphasis on mental health. UC Santa Cruz has. And is tuition called. Caps which is the. Counseling and psychological services. Department at our school. We of are currently staffed at a ratio of one to seventeen hundred. Students to faculty ratio there. And after four sessions. At that institution you're referred off campus. Assuming you can even afford to go there insurance covers. So. Also. That's funded by student fees and not by. Anything else systems are paying for this. I think I want to bring out. Was very pantries. We have one fifty insurance our campus serving. All of seventy thousand students undergraduate. And graduate students as well. Battling his by the sunset was established Patterson government. The future is uncertain because it is the space is help them. Isn't helpers which is our office for. That's for education and recreation sports. So the gem and sports and all that sort of way. And it's not the spaces and designated. That was established by the student. Not by any sort of. Tuition or administrative body. Currently public. Sam go are not on nobody has the right spoke about this. Is working to. Change order coffee shops. Entry. Their places and. And I just think it's astounding that students have to take upon themselves. To. Perform services that should. Should be. Under their. Should be their problem. This question we paid tuition that is so expensive. And were. Right with it being a raise this year. The housing crisis better addressed as well. Private match. Will be a. Technology by Anthony listeners will someone just. You see my type thing has brought me here. You can. That's seven Alison the phone by and then you've Biondo. I am out clear and in the third year you see. So the last couple of years. And I've been helping my sister and my cousin. Piper college. And it's been a really special time because. Were all family the migraines and. Were all were going to be the first generation in our family to go and. And everyone took said in the ruins of proud but at the same time there's just so much wary involved. I'm in applying because over the last couple years in this process and going to college myself it's become so clear that. And access to higher education access the pap that if you do your dreams and. Is like so hard and and it's not just getting into your dream school I don't know how to tell. My cousins on huntsman sister that link. Getting there and and maintaining access to that the school your dream sometimes require skipping sometimes requires working with will just suddenly fires. Like not being able to study in failing a test and having to deal with that so. We need to do better all of us need to do better and. There are so many kids out there with so much ambition with. That are so smart and so bright who do not get the opportunity and who feel like. They can't and and it's just it's a shame and needs to better. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you also. Matt Simmons in Geneva Miano followed by to be so what what what Kira watcher. It I like to see. To non your being here at this meeting. I'd like to I think the committee for giving me the opportunity to talk about. Some of the green issues I of witnessing experience at my university UC Santa Cruz. And I want to start by saying my name is Anthony far beyond I'm a first year student. And. I saw freshman starting university in the fall of two thousand seventeen nam I felt very excited phone very on. Grateful to witness some of the opportunities to be given to me summaries his I could potentially like take advantage off. But I wanted to talk and stress about like some of the issues regarding the relationship between housing and over enrollment. At my university. And. Throughout the year I've witnessed the school crammed thousands of students in to various housing units but just don't have the capacity or the utilities. To fit a like most of these people. And. Mayor Dorn such as mine are often very crowded and it's very. Not it does not not suitable for living conditions. For me this transformation was very comfortable to handle. Some of the utilities in my dorm are often exhausted to the point of having electrical blackouts. Clogged toilets sinks and. Shower drains as well as. Various colleges like broken doors. Broken window sometimes broken washing machines and dryers. And. You know living in a small room with two other roommates who have various stuff. We can often prove very up claustrophobic to me sometimes as well as being very affected to my allergies I often. As a person with a history of asthma Idaho often proves like very. Stressful to. Be comfortable and then like very stressful to. To sleep as well so I often found myself witnessing that I've been prone to be more sick often I've. Often god are groups like. Sore throats nam very runny noses and I often found myself going to the health center like. Every month or so. And. It may seem simple to just say. Make a simple request maybe find yourself a single room bite on the weightless is astoundingly long because of how many students are enrolled at UCSC. That the most likely response and I would receive would be. Next year in the fall of two thousand eighteen. And. Because of this I also have to juggle the stresses of studying for my finals on winter quarter and also. Knowing where am I going to live next year one my going to live with and how we gonna figure out the costs and stuff like that. So. I just wanted to ask you all like to St questions to consider power as you go on today. And. Number one was. Since it has been reported that the state of California's project began a sixty seven million dollars billion dollars not million dollar surplus. Look good proportion of the garden that had very of situations that. California public institutions are currently facing. And number two is what is currently the best planned to have to conduct some of these issues. And with number three on with all of us residing in the state. That holds some of the world's greatest learning institutions. Dear how these great colleges are slowly deteriorating. Israel arming and disheartening for me. Myself and thousands of other students in the UC system. Calyces system and California community college system are provided the proper amount. And quality of the services needed to survive and grow. Then how do expect our generation those support the next generation of college students think. Next it was. Three so what you're. Memories you know Troma. Hello everyone my name is that I saw she to and I'm to externalize president for the associated students of UC Merced as well as the campaign chair for you see a say. I'm I'm here today up to make sure to ask that you. Put more funding in higher education and I want to start by telling you my narrative of how I got see in my journey in the. US so four years of high school fun times. My to ninety the classes I was involved added student government I'm putting on top of them making sure that I was attracted to the you see I was also. I'm acting as a parent for my stirs up because my parents were busy right they had to work in order for me to go to college. And so I did well I went my if I did my first semester I did really well I got on the honor system. And then I come home over winter break in my parents but the news that I to resettle the can go back to this semester. I UC Merced rate for years I spent juggling a. Training I like that for years I spent drug juggling student governments to delay my AB because even with my stirs right making sure that they go to school making sure that they were. Clean making sure they eight making sure they were fed like I was practically is up appearance my sisters right at the age of fourteen I was taking care of three peat. Right. And for all of that hard work to go down to the guard because my parents couldn't afford. Could not afford it for me to stay at UC Merced rate. So I hope that you are taking my narrative. Into consideration right you have people. To spend so much time and energy just to get here right and now that we got here we don't have the resources to sustain us. Great I'm I don't think it should be this difficult right I don't have reek I don't know the resources offered to member side because I'm an immigrant rate. Idea how parents I could talk to it and how my grandparents I could two I was the first one in my heart and my family to attend a forty university. So I don't have aye the opportunity or resources or whatever that my school provided I didn't know about that I rate aye again democratic. I came here when I was three like. But we do nothing we just knew each other that's that's what I had my family right into going to college right not having my family not having my support system. Right but also are having to like having the two three wait two three week wait to go to catch. That's absurd great so making sure that your also putting money into I hope resources. Because Merced has highest percentage of appeal see students write low income students but no way to support them great we don't have. Our campus ray our food pantry is once a month on. Our food pantries and accessible to students right so making sure that you are putting money into higher education to suspend your students right because. We shouldn't be working three jobs they also juggling art class. To make sure we're now if you really want to get fired up within a career eight so I I really ask that you are. Taking everything they were saying its current consideration. In that you find that you see fund this use use fund the community colleges. Because if you do all of my sisters will be my siblings will be here and now my goal is to graduate right making sure I make money. My sisters can colleges because my parents because I'll be the one who has to raise them ray because my parents are getting old. In that will be my responsible so I'm back to square one I'm back to being a parent great when I should be an older sister Y. should be a mentor. Right. So. Patrol consider that. Thank you very much. They do is a next will Mauricio. We should draw. Good afternoon. Many Israelis your trade hope. I I'm an undergraduate a undocumented working class incident leader at the nurses California Merced. I currently I serve of the organizing director for the external office of associations summer said and have the privilege of serving on the executive board. Of the UC stern association of the campus action chair. At the bay at the young age of eight years old. By a single mother and my family decided to migrate out United States. Worried I'd recited an Orange County garden Grove California. How mean to navigate a the American culture learn the language and about myself into a society that the not necessarily view me as a potential? For this they are even to anything I had to fight and been for resources are going up the single mother I to begin working at a young age of two years old. Where I would do a construction work? While at the same time balancing my education. When I began high school. A people around me were thinking and talking about going to college you're thinking about possibilities and they're gaining themselves. Those necessity opportunities to get their. So now I continue to push myself and I could to push myself to get there but the same time balancing the work. In being involved in the community that was part of being a are a mentor to a lot of people that were around me who are like myself and document. So I saw myself applying to college apply to see if you seen UC's which none of them. I never I didn't meet their standards I wasn't a step the twenty the universe isn't it and the to buy decided appeal my with of the system. Wimp that's where I ended up are you see Merced now you see Merced considers it opens panics or institution with. I believe it's a sin eighty percent of people of color first generation low income students yet Merced does not have the resources to retain insisting the students have a threesome mention. Are we have an off campus food pantry and curly fifty percent of the Somerset student undergraduate students based food insecurity water at the system level it's forty six percent. That's eleven percent more than system wide using research students are facing footage occurs and I really think about that we live in the Central Valley would newly. Food is grown here yet students not December said not to students but people in the own commuting the center by the are going hungry. I'm so I'm here today because arm once I arrive to you see Merced arm I was pushed to go to higher education as a way to liberate myself. But the same time I was not able to find the retention the leader and being a student worker I work for service my documents. At this. The advising center first the social sciences humanities and arts and I serve as a mentor for ask me thirty to. The unions not but the same time were forced to be able to find a pen these resources as you see today we have no administrators from the summer so that came. And had this conversation with you are there's an issue there we need a love to find. Both the UC system the CSU system and the CS you are in the commuter cartilages we today we talked about equity we talked about inclusion we talked about the adversity. We talk about economic and social. Just this year we can how these conversations it were provided and now I'm packing the systematic barriers for students to thrive in these systems were not. Finding the solutions as I'm here for you as I'm by applying to graduate and op exam levels are hard for me. As a we just have eyes with in person county just this past week I mean we're not doing anything to actively protect our students and protect. Their. Their sustainability within the systems any other issue a. Thing you know you're welcome good evening everybody my name to the locust you I attend here have Fresno City. I'm secretary of the velocity club in a member of the pathway to law. Program it's a pipeline. Program designed to diversify the demographics and prepare and inspire students to pursue a career in law. On their to provide representation for people like me something that the lock rear like many are missing. Like Mr Medina mentioned here we are again asking for people like us faculty like a staff like because it center alright. I move on to the U. S. that. Is approaching twenty trillion a common term that's being used. Some students. Acquire dead before they go on to college so students acquire debt. When they're in college. So students who become individuals and going to the workforce. Leave college graduating college with day. My so. It makes me wonder. Are we being condition and accustomed to debt. Is a trickle down effect more of a rhetorical question. Speaking a debt Berkeley law program with housing is over eighty one. Three easily over to. Let me see. Like. Many people. Who spoke up here depend on grants? In order for them them stay in school to pay for bare necessities. Basic needs right like Spencer mentioned one of the speakers at the very beginning. So the trump administrators all this is my question to you to the panel. But open ministration is seeking to cut north three billion over five percent from the education department while I'm. One point billion. Por private school vouchers. Other school choice programs. The creek bed key proposed changes. Cuts several discretionary grant programs. Which many people smoke appeared depend on. Grants including the DC tuition. Aid program number question is what stands for actions are being taken to prepare for this change on your and. And what steps and or actions do you recommend students to prepare for for this change. Thank you my name's Danilov Castillo I attend friend. Fresno City here. Right yeah they think. They don't see him what one more comment one more public comment there. Please le let us know your name. My name is for money managers Ortega and I am from Fresno state university.

And the odd turn it inside up on the right place you doing great but I don't read. I just came here to say on. I have shown good food insecurity I have actually used those student pantry on campus. And. It's not as great as they made it seem in the panel on a lot of time the food there is spoiled. So we kinda have to get the food and hope that it it still edible. Are in addition I work right now we are facing. Apostolate tuition increase for the second year in a row. On we are actually planning on going over to Sacramento and asking governor brown for one funding for its use you. Because on something that we notices that as on. As the morning students of color had entered to see if you use the lighter on this the funding for his issues has become lighter. And we feel that that is not right we want us we want something someone up full of money. For this is to use so that our own federal would have to show it this every year. Because on. We actually had a could I. Cook convinced nam poorer part of. We're gonna at issue is of worker sees member here at and Fresno. On we committed to putting gas increase but it took awhile because. Did he see he thought that that was the only way that it on see if you can be funded. But this this year they decided to on allows. To proposes budget before the decision felt that is why we are going to Sacramento and we're hoping to take as many people who can we are at actually I want to invite all of you. To come with us to Sacramento to ask for the funding. You Mister there. Arambula it's your Medina Mister Allen. Mister Berlin. I hope you can join us and everyone else here we have people here from rise who I hope will join us all. On wheels at a sea of that he has the same number and I hope that they can join us also.

That there's a group of senators that are gonna be proposing and by out of the tuition increases from the new budget I would. Love to have my colleagues. We would certainly love to hear about when not rallies can. Sure you'll have a number of members who. You know eight it said I was very touched by the comments that were made. And I members hearing a lot of these when I was. The board of regents in member and and sad to me how. How are how many of the problems that we talked about and having yet been solved effect in some respects it gotten worse? With with the situation and in Washington nothing else so I'm I I really appreciate everyone being. So far and I know the hardships. You took to to to get here and I am. We're gonna work hard to try to turn around so that extra money it's in the budget to help address. Some of these affordability questions.

I need to bring him to more elected officials need to bring into the governor you can bring into the. Members of Congress represent Central Valley members the legislature's well. So they will take those those voices with them when they're making visions in. And Washington in Sacramento site I really do appreciate everybody's call. Thank you the center. It'd make an opening statement so I. Feel good about making a closing statement. But to the student from Santa Barbara. That. Don't first let me thank. Everyone including. Fresno community college. And I chair for having is here. But I think what you're doing and what you're saying here today is exactly what. I senator Allen said. Needs to continue to happen. It is too often in Sacramento that we look at numbers. And not individuals so if the students will continue to do what they've done here today. But they did in Sacramento a couple weeks ago. And bring more students with you. And bring more stories with you so that the legislature and the governor here's the effect. Of what we're doing in Sacramento on your individual lives I think we'll do better so thank you. Especially the students from UC riverside everything is imminent. That Arambula we don't have anything. I. Was moves today. You know I'm encouraged to think that our community will look like what we saw today. That this advocacy that you are doing is inspiring so many of us means a lot. And I just wanted to say thank you to all the students who took time out. I know it's not easy I know it's not check.
