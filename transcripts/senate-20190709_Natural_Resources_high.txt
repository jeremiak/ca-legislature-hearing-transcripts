TEN FIFTY SEVEN VERY GOOD FILE ITEM SEVENTEEN MEMBERS. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON ASSEMBLY BILL. TEN FIFTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OIL WELL OIL AND GAS WELLS THIS FIGURE INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THOUSAND IDOLS MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND POSE A HIGH RISK FOR DESERTION. AS OIL PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN OVER THE IMPACT THAT DESERTED OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURES COULD HAVE LEADING TAXPAYERS TO ADDRESS THE RISK. AND COVER THE COST BASED ON CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES COSTS TO TAXPAYERS COULD BE AS HIGH AS TWO HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT MILLION PER TEN THOUSAND OIL WELLS. IN MY DISTRICT ALONE THE RECENT BACK RIGHT BANKRUPTCIES OF TWO OIL COMPANIES WILL COST TAXPAYERS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION. OIL AND GAS PRODUCERS ALREADY ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PLUG WELLS WHEN THEY ENTER INTO LEASES WITH THE STATE TO DRILL. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE FULFILL THIS OBLIGATION ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY SEVEN WILL STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR ONSHORE OIL AND GAS WELLS. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT TAXPAYERS ARE PROTECTED FROM THE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES IN THE EVENT OF THAT A COMPANY FAILS TO FILL THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATION TO DECOMMISSION OIL PRODUCTION SITES. I'M COMMITTED TO HOLDING ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND INCLUDING COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY AT VICTORIA ROME AND I FILL OUT AN AD IN THE LITTLE AYE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M VICTORIA AROUND WHAT THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. TEN FIFTY SEVEN L. TAKES PROACTIVE STEPS TO HELP INSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAXPAYERS ARE NOT LEFT HOLDING THE BAG FOR REMEDIATION AND DECOMMISSIONING. OF ON SHORE IDLE OIL WELLS. WE KNOW FROM RECENT EXAMPLES IN THE OFFICE OR CONTEXT WHERE WELL OPERATORS WENT BANKRUPT. THAT COSTS CAN QUICKLY BALLOON INTO THE TENS OR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS CALIFORNIA'S OIL PRODUCTION DECLINES IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE INDUSTRY SAFELY PLUG WELLS AND CLEAN UP THE SITES. AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN MAKE SURE BUT THE COSTFOR THESE ACTIVITIES ARE APPROPRIATELY BORN BY THE OIL INDUSTRY AND OUR DC REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU MUCH. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL ON THEM WE HAVE TO VOTE ON CALIFORNIA -- I'LL BE BRIEF AND JUST REALLY POINT OUT A COUPLE OF OF DATA POINTS THAT I THINK MAY BE USEFUL FOR THE COMMITTEE -- TO TO HEAR ONE IS THAT RECENTLY IN CONVERSATIONS -- AMONG STAKEHOLDERS AND AND FOLKS REPRESENTING DR THEY MENTIONED THAT OF THE SIXTY SIX ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ARE CURRENTLY EXIST ON ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS. THIRTY FOUR OF THOSE -- THE THE OWNER IS IS NOT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FIND THE OWNER -- THEY'RE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND SO IT'S MORE THAN 50%. THIS BEING THE CASE -- SO THIS BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE ONE A IN BEING ABLE TO SETTING CONTROLS AND MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOU CAN PROPERLY TRACK AND TRACE -- THE ACTUAL OWNERS ARE TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE IN THE EVENT OF ALLEN AND SECOND IS REALLY -- KIND OF ADDRESSING THE WHAT'S BEEN ARTICULATED ABOUT. THE RECENT EXAMPLE OF THE OFFSHORE SPACE -- YOU KNOW ONE EXAMPLE THAT -- HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY IN HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IS THE PLUGGING IN AND AN ABANDONMENT OF TWO IDLE WELLS IN ECHO PARK IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA -- WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THE COST TO DO THAT HAS BEEN IN THE AND THE ORDER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? AND WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE MORE EXAMPLES LIKE THAT TO COME -- AS THE THE DIVISION CONTINUES TO DO ITS WORK AND AND AND KIND OF IDENTIFYING WERE THESE -- THESE SITES EXIST THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- AND CALIFORNIA WRIT LARGE -- WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE THE KIND OF MECHANISM THE THE CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE HERE SO THAT THE DIVISION SUPERVISOR HAS TO BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE SORT OF RISK FACTORS TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN URBAN AREAS LIKE IN ECHO PARK NEAR DODGER STADIUM WHERE YOU HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF POPULATION OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW AND THOSE COSTS. SHOULD BE EVALUATED AND BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A BETTER LEVEL OF CERTAINTY -- ON BOTH ENDS -- WITH THAT -- CLOTHES AND RESPECTFULLY ABLE QUESTIONER AND I I THANK YOU SO MUCH -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ONE OF THE MEAT ON THE WITHOUT AMONG CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. JAMIE ON BEHALF OF THE OF A SOUL IN SUPPORT. IS INJURED HER DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL PROTECTION NETWORK IN SUPPORT. WE'LL BRING HER THREE FIFTY SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE OKAY -- SEEN NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT -- THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. I MAKE A COUPLE SEATS FORM HERE. MORNING WELL LEARNING SEARCHER MEMBERS. ARE NOT LOSE CENTERS WITH THE WESTERN SEAS PATROLMEN'S ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB -- TEN FIFTY SEVEN BUT FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THINK -- THE AUTHOR AND SPECIFICALLY -- STAFFER CONVENING -- YOU KNOW THE APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS. A LAUNDRY LIST OF CONCERNS WE HAVE SHARED WITH -- WITH THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CURRENT BILL IN PRINT -- AS OUR LETTER STATES OUR BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS REALLY NO -- UNILATERAL AUTHORITY FOR DOCTOR TO INSTITUTE A MONEY REQUIREMENT WITHOUT A CAP SO WE WE DEFINITELY NEED A CAP. THAT HAS WITHOUT A CAP THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL POWER TO BASICALLY PUT OPERATORS OUT OF BUSINESS SO -- IN IN DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WAS SUPPOSED MEMBERS NEED A CAP AGAIN TO ENSURE STABILITY IN THE ABILITY TO MOVE CAPITAL TOWARDS INVESTMENTS -- IN WORK FORCING CONTINUE OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THE MOST STRINGENT LABOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY STATE. STANDARDS. IN ADDITION WE LIKED INCLUSION OF SELF INSURANCE TO BE. AS ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS -- THAT CAN BE USED IN THE TERMINATIONS AND PROVIDING CLARITY AS TO HOW THE BOND SUPPLY DIRECTLY TO A COMPANY WITH SUBSIDIARIES AS WELL AS ISSUES RELATING TO PROTECTING. CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION ON ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS THAT DAUGHTER CAN COLLECT I THINK THAT GOES TO THE POINT. FROM ONE OF THE THE GENTLEMAN IN SUPPORT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT DOCTOR HAS THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE INFORMATION AS TO HOW -- ASSETS WHICH ARE TRANSFERRED IN AND THEY CAN APPROPRIATELY GO AFTER -- THE THE APPROPRIATE STAKEHOLDER. TO TO PLUG IN ABANDONED OR PROVIDE THE FINANCIAL -- MONIES TO TO COVER THAT COST SO -- AGAIN MISTER CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO OBVIOUSLY THANK YOU -- AND AND CATHERINE IN THE COMMITTEE FOR BEING PART OF THE THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP AND WE LOOK FOR TO HAVING -- CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR HOPEFULLY DURING THE SUMMER RECESS BUT FOR THESE REASONS WE WE WE MUST REPENT OF LOS. I THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible] NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF P. ANTHONY THOMAS RIBS IN THE CALIFORNIA. INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION -- LET ME START BY SAYING WE APPRECIATE. THE MEETING THAT WE HAD -- WITH THE CONSULTANT AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS -- BUT HE SENT TO THE BILL ITSELF. NOT TO BE AS HARSH AS POSSIBLE BUT WE THINK ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SOLVE. A PROBLEM THAT REALLY DOES NOT EXIST. MAINLY THE THREAT OF THE STATE HAVING MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN UNFUNDED ROOF REPAIR MEDIATION COSTS. FOR FROM WELLS. OVER THE PAST ONE HUNDRED YEARS MISTER CHAIRMAN. DRILLING AND PRODUCTION AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY IN OUR ESTIMATE AND WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO YOU THERE ARE SIXTEEN OFTEN WELL AS AN ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SIXTEEN AND INDUSTRY PROVIDES THE FUNDING AS YOU WELL KNOW TO PLUG IN A BANDING CALLED ORPHAN WELLS. THE FUND IT PAYS FOR PLUGGING AN ABANDONMENT OF THESE REMAINING FROM WELLS IS AT AN ALL TIME RECORD HIGH. AN ALL TIME RECORD HIGH. ALL THE OLD AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE WHICH WAS CHAPLAIN. TWENTY SIXTEEN ESTARá TO RECORD PROCESS OF PLUGGING IN ABANDONING IDA WELLS IN THE STATE. THE SPONSOR OF THE BE -- FEAR THIS ARMAGEDDON. ARMAGEDDON OF THE INDUSTRY AND AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF WAR FROM WELLS SUDDENLY BECOMING THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE. NOW THE POSSIBILITY MISTER CHAIRMAN OF ALL PRODUCERS SIMULTANEOUSLY DISAPPEARING DISAPPEARING IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY. UCES HAVE INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THEIR OPERATIONS AS AN AS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES IT IS TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. SUPPORT CAN WHISPER HAS MET BUT THE AUTHOR AS YOU WELL KNOWN. AS WELL THIS DOG AND A PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON THAT WE PROVIDED IN LIEU OF GIVING THE SUPERVISOR UNLIMITED AUTHORITY. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IS APPROPRIATE IN THIS DAY AND TIME. THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE DID OFFER WOULD LIMIT THE BONDING AUTHORITY TO TWENTY MILLION FOR OPERATORS BUT MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND WELLS. IT WOULD ALSO HAVE FORMING FOR THOSE AT 500-211-0000 WELLS HE PROPOSED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE HOLES WITH FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED WELLS AND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THE BILL'S WITH LESS THAN FIFTY WELLS. CURRENTLY INDEPENDENT OPERATORS IN THE PUT UP A BLANKET BOND. FOR THE WELLS OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE WILL WHICH IS TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE UNDER THE AMENDMENTS OPERATORS COULD ELECT. AS WE PROPOSED A FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVE. FINANCIAL TURN OF THAT A SINGLE WELL SUCH AS A SECURED FUND THAT SET ASIDE REVENUE GENERATED BY THAT WELL OVER ITS ENTIRE LIFE. RATHER THAN ONE UP FRONT SOME OF DOLLARS THE PHONE WOULD BE DEEMED ADEQUATE BY DAGR TO COVER THE FUTURE ABANDONMENT COSTS OF THAT PARTICULAR WELL. AND WITHDRAWAL OF THOSE PHONE TO ONLY BE BY MUTUAL CONSENT OF DOG -- AND THE OPERATOR YUP THE AUTHOR HAS NOT ACCEPTED HI INDUSTRY SUGGESTED A MAN'S AND INSTEAD OFFERED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP. A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CAP TO WHAT TO SUPERVISOR COULD REQUIRE FROM AN OPERATOR. OBVIOUSLY MISTER CHAIRMAN SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE OPERATORS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BOND ATFIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT WOULD PUT MY MEMBERS OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT MIGHT BE THE GOAL OF SOME ON THE OPPOSITION. BUT THAT'S TRUE IF IN FACT YOU PUT THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE OPERATORS OUT OF BUSINESS TEN FIFTY SEVEN FOR NOW EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM THAT IT ATTEMPTS TO EXIST. TO FALL OFF. AS I CLOSE -- INDUSTRY AS A POLICY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. WE HAVE A POLICY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IF IN FACT YOU PROCEED DOWN THIS PATH HERE. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'LL COME BACK IN ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO OR YEAR OR THREE WHAT THE SAME EXACERBATED PROBLEMS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS WE CAN IN THIS NOW PUT APPEARED AT THE END OF THIS SENTENCE. SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SO THE TEN FIFTY SEVEN TO THE WORLD I NO LONGER NEEDED. NOW I'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF YOU ON MANY OCCASIONS ASKING FOR YOU TO HOLD BILLS IN COMMITTEE I THINK THE TEN FIFTY SEVEN IS A PRIME CANDIDATE TO BE HELD IN COMMITTEE. WORKED ON PUT A TIME LIMIT IF YOU IF IF YOU SO DESIRE BUT THIS BILL SHOULD NOT BE PASSED OUT IF IT'S PASSED OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN IT RUNS THE CLOCK AUDI SINCE YOU WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT. HOLD IT IN COMMITTEE ALLOW US TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ANY OPPOSITION PUT A TIME LIMIT ON IT WE DON'T GET PASSED TO TOM AND THEN MOVE THE BILL TO APPROPRIATIONS. UNTIL THEN SUPER STANDS OPPOSED TO YOUR BILL. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE TESTIMONY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A PAUSE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED QUORUM HERE NOW THAT WE HAVE CRITICAL MASS MEMBERS SO -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL IN A STERN STERN HERE JONES JONES HERE ALLEN. ELLEN HERE BOARD JUST COVER EURO CAREER -- HERE HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO HERE JACKSON MONEY. OKAY VERY GOOD NOW WE HAVE A QUORUM -- WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE MEMBERS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE -- SEEN ONE SECOND HERE. CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION I WISH I HAD ONE BUT I DON'T I I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT -- THAT I I SUPPORT THE THE THE BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO I THINK WE DO NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR CLEAN UP I DO I AM SENSITIVE HOWEVER TO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE UNILATERAL AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE SECURITY BOND AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S DISCUSSIONS ON LANGUAGE AND SO -- WITH THAT IN MIND I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. AND I'M SORRY I I DIDN'T. SCRIPT THE PROCEDURE A LITTLE BIT HERE -- ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION I DID WHAT I IN A OFTEN OPPORTUNE I APOLOGIZE. TO ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION YOUR DAY. ON THE BILL. OKAY SEE. NINE THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT CENTER CABALLERO -- PRECIADO THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS AND I YOU KNOW I'VE HAD SOME OF THESE SIMILAR MEETINGS. LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES PROPOSED I'M I WOULD I WOULD NOTED. ED THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD. IN THE BILL -- WILD I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I I I I I WOULD AT OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY IS TO CLARIFY. BUT I DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF THE INTENT WAS. TO SHUT DOWN -- LARGE SECTORS OF THE INDUSTRY BUT MORE SO TO TRY TO FIND SOME WAY. TO IS NOT LEAVE US IN THE SAME PLACE THAT SOME OF THOSE IN COAL COUNTRY HAVE BEEN LEFT WHERE YOU SORT OF RELYING TO SELF INSURANCE MARKET AND WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE FALL OUT OF THAT BANKRUPTCY. GERMAN PROCESS HERE SO -- SENSITIVE TO SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO COMMENT BACK ON THEN YOU CAN YOU CAN COMBINE THAT YOUR CLOSES OKAY AS WELL HERE THE SERBS HAVE SO YES THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS. NOT TO LEAVE TAXPAYERS WITH. A HUGE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC DOLLARS THAT NEED TO GO INTO CLEANING UP THAT'S WHAT IT IS AND THE CONVERSATIONS I A DO WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION WAS BUT IT HAS PROVIDED LANGUAGE AND RETAIN -- WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SEPTA AND WE'VE YET TO SEE ANYTHING IN WRITING -- IN TERMS OF THE AMENDMENTS UP FROM STEP UP BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE THE INTENTION IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO DEAL WITH THESE ORPHANED WELLS THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE THAT THERE'S ONLY SIXTEEN THERE'S TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WELLS AT THAT OUR CANDIDATES TO BE OR FAN. AND ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND WELLS AT HAVING PRODUCED OIL IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO. OUR PROBLEM IS BIGGER -- IT THEN IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF SIXTEEN AND WHEN. THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE A WAY TO PAY FOR IT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THE CLEANUP AND AS IS BEING GIVEN AN EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A IN IN THE DISTRICT ALONE THERE'S ONE THAT COST A HUNDRED MILLION SO WHERE DO YOU WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM WHAT WHAT DOLLARS THAT TAKE AWAY FROM AND SO. OUR HOPE IS TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS TO IDENTIFY WHAT ELEMENTS -- OF THIS COULD BE ADOPTED IN A WAY. THAT DOESN'T HAVE A MASTER GOAL OF SETTING ANYTHING DOWN BUT DOES HAVE THE GOAL OF PROTECTING TAXPAYERS DOLLARS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. LIABLE -- FOR THE COST TO CLEAN THEM UP IT'S VERY COSTLY AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WE'VE COMMITTED TO WORK I THINK BOTH SIDES ACTUALLY ARE COMMITTED TO WORK THROUGH THE SUMMER I'M TRYING TO FIND LANGUAGE THERE'S BEEN AND SOME OPPOSITION LANGUAGES BEEN PRESENTED TO US WE COUNTERED IMMIGRANT. REALLY KIND OF IN THE BACK AND FORTH PROCESS. WHEN THEY -- JUST ASK IS YOUR IS YOUR ENGAGING IN THIS PROCESS PLEASE. KEEP THE COMEDIAN FORM I WOULD SAY MY BIGGEST CONCERN. ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE NUMBER PROCESS IS. HOW HOW FORTY STRAIGHT FROM THE REASONABLENESS STANDARD BECAUSE IN SOME CASES YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY LIMITED? LIABILITY SO SEE WITH A CERTAIN FORMATION AND IT WOULD BE VERY LOW BUT IN SOME YOU'RE AT A HUNDRED MILLION AND SO HOW TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE AND ALLOW THIS SORT OF STATE SPECIFIC FACTORS TO WEIGH IN AYE. IT'S GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO TAYLOR I DON'T I ALSO DON'T IF THE THE BILL MOVES THROUGH TODAY I DON'T CONSIDER THIS -- RUNNING THE CLOCK I I THINK THERE'S A I'VE HEARD A PRETTY GOOD FAITH. INTENT TO ENGAGE IN A PROCESS HERE AND I I'M COMMITTED TO THE SAME. ON BEHALF OF THIS COMMITTEE SO -- IS A TERM YOU YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN BALANCE LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT SHE HAD. PERSONAL AND PRIVATE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. DOES TEN FIFTY SEVEN PUT A PERIOD AT THE END THE DISSENTERS DOES THIS SOLVED THE PROBLEM. IN ITS CURRENT FATE DOES NOT WITH YOU IT IS NOT THAT OLD SOUL SO WE CAN. OUR CAR POINT IS ACTUALLY MORE TO DO THOUGH THAT THAT'S THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO OIL AND AND THE ISSUES THAT FACE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ACTUALLY DON'T. I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S PROBABLY TOO AMBITIOUS TO FINALLY PUT TO PUT A PERIOD AT THE END OF THE SENSE AROUND ISSUES OF OIL IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THIS IS WE ARE A PETRO. STATE RIGHT NOW AND WE WE DRIVE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE ON THE PLANET AND THERE'S DEMAND SIDE ISSUES AND SUPPLY SIDE ISSUE SO. I I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THAT CERTAINTY IN THE INDUSTRY BUT I ALSO -- I DON'T WANNA PUT TOO MUCH ON THIS ONE PIECE OF LEGISLATION HERE TO SOLVE THE ENTIRE OIL ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THERE'S OTHER OUTSIDE STUDIES GOING ON AS WELL SO -- WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING A DILIGENT WORK HERE -- I APPRECIATE BOTH THE INPUT AND THE AUTHOR'S WORK AND I I'D BE OPEN ENTERTAINING A MOTION AT THIS TIME WITH ALL DUE RESPECT SO YES THIS IS YOUR THIS IS NOT LEAVE OUT THE OPPORTUNITY FILL THESE WELLS WITH NATURAL GAS. I'M JOKING THAT WAS A JOKE. FOR BUT ANYWAY I'M AT THE PIER YOU ALMOST YOU WANT YOU ALMOST PAGE TO THE SEMI COLON NOSES -- I MOVE THE BILL MISTER -- OKAY -- OR DO YOU. FOR THAT -- INTERESTING MOTION.

HUESO AYE JACKSON MONEY IS ON CALL FOR THAT OKAY WILL LEAVE THEM IS WRONG CALL THANK YOU MEMBERS -- OF COURSE YOU ONE MORE BILL VERY GOOD [inaudible] AB. AB. SIXTEEN EIGHTY I WANTED TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WITH THE COPY AT THAT I AM WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FINALIZE DEADLINES TO ENSURE THIS BILL GIVES THE STATE THE TOOLS TO FINALLY ACHIEVE. PUBLIC ACCESS AT HOLLISTER RANCH HOLLISTER RANCHES OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ACRE SUBDIVISION THAT INCLUDES EIGHT POINT FIVE MILES OF PUBLICLY OWNED SHORELINE OVER THIRTY SEVEN YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COASTAL COMMISSION ADOPTED A HOLLISTER RANCH PUBLIC ACCESS PROGRAM. THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AXES PROGRAM HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED CONTRADICTING THE CLEAR LEGISLATIVE INTENT. THAT AN AXIS PROGRAM BE IMPLEMENTED AS EXPEDIENT WE AS POSSIBLE. OVER. FOR OVER THIRTY SEVEN YEARS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HAS BEEN CUT OFF FROM ENJOYING THE NATURAL TREASURES OFFERED BY A CALIFORNIA COASTLINE WHICH ARE OWNED BY THE PUBLIC. THE GOAL OF ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN EIGHTY IS TO SET UP A CLEAR FAINT FRAMEWORK TO ACHIEVE PUBLIC ACCESS AT HOLLISTER RANCH. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE THAT AS WE PROCEED A. B. C. NINETY SIXTEEN EIGHTY REMAIN STRONG AND WILL ACTUALLY RESULT IN FULL FULLY IMPLEMENTED ACCESS PROGRAM. I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE RANCH OWNERS TODAY AB SIXTEEN EIGHTY RESULT IN A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT BUILDS ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE THAT ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA BEACHES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY. REGARDLESS OF THERE'S A CODE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU WELCOME WITNESS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL ON THE HERE ON BEHALF OF US SOON -- ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO TO ELEVATING LETTING LEADERSHIP INVOICES ON COASTAL ACCESS AND COASTAL PROTECTION -- ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO I THINK THIS MORNING TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL FROM THE STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE -- AS AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS DEDICATED ON TO TO ENCOURAGING AND FOMENTING -- COMMUNITIES THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE COAST TO GET OUT THERE AND WE WE INTIMATELY ARE. AWARE OF HOW YEARS FOR ACCESS -- WHEN YOU HAVE LIKE IN IN THE CASE OF A LOT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES -- THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS TO THE BEACH -- LIMITING THE ACCESS DONE THROUGH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WHETHER IT'S PUTTING UP A FAKE WITH SIGNS SAYING NO PARKING OR THAT THERE IS NO PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE BEACH -- WRIT LARGE WE HAVE EXAMPLES UP AND DOWN THE COAST IN CALIFORNIA. IN THREE PARTICULAR ONES AND AND HOLLISTER RANCH BEING I THINK ONE OF THOSE THOSE MAJOR EXAMPLES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEBATED NOW -- FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF US SOON. THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE LOOKED UPON AS A SETTING A REALLY GOOD PRESIDENT ABOUT WHETHER OR CALIFORNIA CAN REALLY MAINTAIN ITS PROMISE AND THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT. TO ITS RESIDENTS -- TO ENSURE ACCESS FOR EVERYBODY -- FOR THESE REASONS -- WE'RE VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT AB AND TEN SIXTY EIGHT OR SIXTEEN EIGHTY EXCUSE ME -- THEN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR COASTAL ACCESS WRIT LARGE AND IN HER DRIVER THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU WELCOMES TRYING SEASON JORDAN CALIFORNIA COASTAL PROTECTION NETWORK WILL TODAY'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED TO CRAFT REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD OPEN UP PUBLIC ACCESS AND HOLLISTER RANCH. AND EIGHT IN HAVE STRETCH OF SPECTACULAR COASTLINE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WHICH HAPPENS TO BE WHERE I LIVE. THE LEGISLATURE'S FIRST EVER TO BEGIN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FORTY YEARS AGO WHEN IT CRAFTED A PATH FOR HOLLISTER OWNERS TO BUILD THEIR HOMES IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING SUBDIVISION WIDE ALL I IN HALF MILES. OF PUBLIC ACCESS HOWEVER WHEN HOLLISTER RANCH CONTINUE TO REFUSE TO COOPERATE A FRUSTRATED LEGISLATURE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO AGAIN TAKE ACTION SO THREE YEARS LATER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE LEGISLATURE GAVE HOLLISTER RANCHES ON SPECIAL COASTAL ACT SECTION. THREE OH SIX ONE OH POINT EIGHT THAT ALLOWED HOLLISTER PARCEL OWNERS TO BUILD THEIR HOMES AND OTHER AMENITIES UNDER THE CONDITION THAT SUBDIVISION WIDE PUBLIC ACCESS WOULD BE PROVIDED. IN THE INTERVENING THIRTY SEVEN YEARS THE LUXURY HOMES THE GUEST HOUSES THE POOLS OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN WERE BUILT BUT PUBLIC ACCESS WAS NEVER PROVIDED INSTEAD THE PUBLIC WAS BLOCKED FROM ENTERING BY A GATE AND A GUARD HOUSE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CRAFTED THE HOLLISTER RANCH REQUIREMENTS BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IT HAD THE BEST OF INTENTIONS AND IT FULLY EXPECTED THAT ACCESS WOULD FINALLY BE PROVIDED? SWIFTLY EXPEDITIOUSLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER AS A LEGISLATION STATED REPEATEDLY YET HERE WE ARE THIRTY SEVEN YEARS LATER AN ACCESS IS STILL BLOCKED WERE YOU YOUR CHILDREN OR ANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO GO THERE TODAY. EVERY ONE OF YOU WOULD BE TURNED AWAY WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT THIS BILL THE FINAL TERMS OF WHICH ARE STILL UNDER NEGOTIATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BE AIRTIGHT. FULLY ENFORCEABLE WAS STRONG CONSEQUENCES IN PENALTIES IF PUBLIC ACCESS IS NOT PROVIDED WITHIN A REASONABLE BUT SWIFT TIME CERTAIN DEADLINE. IN THE WEEK OF EXT IN THE WAKE OF EXTENSIVE MEDIAN TENSION AND PUBLIC SCRUTINY THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST YEAR I BELIEVE THERE ARE NOW SOME. HOLLISTER RANCH HOMEOWNERS THAT BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE A LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THE LAW TO PROVIDE SUBDIVISION WHY PUBLIC ACCESS AT HOLLISTER RANCH BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHERS FOR HIM TO LAY AN OBSTRUCTION HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST. AND WHO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK PERSISTENTLY TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO BLOCK ACCESS WHY WOULDN'T DAY IT'S WORKED FOR FORTY YEARS. AND JUST YESTERDAY A HOMEOWNER FILED LEGAL SUIT ON THE PREMISE THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO ADD ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT PROVIDING THE PUBLIC ACTS AS THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED. THIS IS THE TIME TO PUT A STOP TO HOLLISTER RANCHES EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ORIGINAL AND EXPLICIT INTENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AS THIS BILL CONTINUES TO INVOLVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO HAVE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. VICTORIA AROUND WITH NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ONE OF THE MEAT ON A WITHOUT A ONE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. JON DRAKE WITH THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DOES HAVE A SUPPORT POSITION ON THIS BILL WE HAVE SOME POTENTIAL CONCERNS WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREFER COMMISSION ON THEM. ULTIMATELY HOWEVER WERE COMMITTED AND ENJOYING THE AUTHOR AND WORKING WITH AGENCIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE MEANINGFUL LASTING PUBLIC ACCESS TO HOLLISTER RANCH LIKE MINE. TO JUST ANYONE MORE COLOR THAT COMMENTARY WHAT WHAT ONE PARTICULAR -- OF CAN OF CONCERNED JUST AS AN INITIAL MATTER. I THINK. THE IDEA IS -- HER EYES ALREADY BEEN ECHOED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PUBLIC ACCESS FINALLY. I KNOW THAT ALL THE PARTIES ARE INVOLVED ARE COMMITTED TO THAT AND THE WERE WORKING IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO PROVIDE THAT. AND SO WE JUST MERELY MEAN TO ECHO THAT SENTIMENT [inaudible] SEEK FINALLY. IS THAT IS THIS YES SEVEN THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU. HERE TOO SO ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OKAY SEEN ORDERS. AT HEAD FAKE BANNER -- ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING. NINE OUT WE CAN BRING BACK TO THE DICE MEMBERS. I HAVE A YEAH I'M HAVING EIGHTEEN EMOTIONALLY PROBABLY TIME I DID I DID WANT TO JUST GET A BRIEF UPDATE. AS IN THE AUTHOR OR FROM THE BUT WE ARE TRYING. TO CATCH US UP HERE AND WHAT HAPPENED SINCE LAST YEAR JUST VERY BRIEFLY IF YOU COULD BECAUSE I KNOW WE HEARD A SIMILAR MEASURE THAT AT A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE ESTABLISH AN ACCOUNT. I BELIEE WILL SETTLEMENT. NEGOTIATIONS ARE STILL UNDER WAY SO JUST CAN YOU CATCH UP LAST YEAR'S EFFORT WAS ABOUT ESTABLISHING AN ACCOUNT -- IN WHERE THAT ACCOUNT WOULD BE USED TO BEGIN THE PROCESS TO GAIN PUBLIC ACCESS AND THAT BILL GOT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND AND THE GOVERNOR VETOED IT SAYING THAT THAT TRUE NEED WAS TO UPDATE THE ACCESS PLAN AND THE BILL YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- IS A BILL WHERE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN AMMO YOU WITH FOR A DEPARTMENTS AT IN THE ADMINISTRATION. WHO ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS THE RANCH OWNERS ARE ALSO AT THE TABLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE GET TO THE PLAN -- AND THE IDEA IS THAT THE GOAL. IS THE KERRY IS WE ALL WORK TOGETHER WE COME UP WITH A PLAN TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ACCESS -- AND THAT PLAN INVOLVES THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE THE RANCH OWNERS AND THE PUBLIC. AND IF THAT IS NOT -- TO IN% PLACE THE BILL AS YOU SEE AMENDED -- EIGHTIES NOW THE STICK IS WELL WE'RE GONNA PUT THE OLD PLAN IN AND SO WE ARE HOPING WE WHAT THE BILL ALSO DOES NOW IS THAT THE BILL EXTENDS THAT DEADLINE FOR US TO CREATE THIS PLAN. UNDERSTOOD OKAY AND THE I APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS ON MEANINGFUL WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS AND WE TALKED WE JUST TALKED AND THE PREVIOUS BILL BUT ACCESS WITHOUT. SERVICES TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK THOUGH IT DOESN'T WORK AND AND SO IN ALL THOSE. THIS IS WHERE WE GOT THAT -- ORNERY HOMEOWNER WHO WANTS TO BE A NAME BE AND PUT UP THE NO PARKING SIGN -- THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND AGAINST THE LAW. THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP. WHAT DO YOU DO THAT RIGHT AND IS IT DOES IT STILL HAVE THAT SENSE OF YOU CAN'T COME HERE -- BECAUSE HOW ARE YOU EVER GOING TO GET THERE A AND ONCE YOU GET THERE. IF YOU DON'T IF YOU DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE OCEAN OR SORT OF DON'T IF YOU FEEL OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT WHAT ARE THOSE SORT OF SERVICES. AND OPERATIONAL -- OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK SO -- I I JUST WANTED PLEDGE OUR OUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK -- THROUGH THIS ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT DEADLINES I KNOW THIS IS SORT OF JUST THE SHOT CLOCK BILL TO SAY LIKE LET'S GET EVERYONE TGETHER. EVEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING HERE -- SO I APPRECIATE THE INTENT I'M JUST AS TO KEEP WORKING WITH COMMITTEE AS WE SORT OF ROUND THAT OUT -- BUT I THINK THERE'S A GOOD PATH FOR HERE HOPEFULLY TO SETTLING THIS ISSUE IN A WAY THAT. THAT WORKS FOR ALL THE PARTIES -- WITH THAT I'D ENTERTAIN A MOTION OR QUESTIONS CENTER CAREER. I WILL MOVE THE BELL -- ALSO -- HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT ONE OF THEM THE MORE DIFFICULT. ISSUES THAT I HAD IN THE THIRTIETH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WAS THAT -- HIGHWAY ONE IN -- BIG SUR APART FROM THE LANDSLIDES AND ALL OF THAT. THE DEVASTATION IT HAPPENS -- KINDA NATURALLY. BUT BUT THE ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY OF THE BEACH IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THERE'S ALSO A REAL NEED -- TO HAVE RESTROOMS AND SO I'M GOING TO PUT THAT ON THE RADAR SCREEN -- THE FEDERAL FOREST SERVICE REFUSED TO CHANGE THE SIGNAGE SO THAT YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE RESTROOMS WERE ON FEDERAL PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN OUT THE TOILETS. AND THE RESIDENTS WERE COMPLAINING BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE THEN DOING THEIR BUSINESS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NEAR THERE. SPOCK'S BOXES WHICH WAS KIND OF DISGUSTING. SO -- SO SO ACT AXIS IS THE FIRST POINT AND THEN IT THEN IT THEN THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW DO YOU. CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT -- WHERE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE AND CAN FIND THE RESTROOMS AND -- AND WE'RE PARKING IS APPROPRIATE AS WELL BECAUSE IF YOU DRIVE DOWN HIGHWAY ONE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING PICTURES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. OUR OR ARE JUST DOUBLE OR TRIPLE PARK IS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND SO WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL COAST ON BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON SIGNAGE. AND WHAT YOU CAN POST OUT NEAR THE ROADWAYS AND SO WE ME THIS MAY BE A BIGGER ISSUE BUT I JUST WANT TO IDENTIFY IT AS THERE ARE. THERE WERE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHO DIDN'T WANT ANY TOURISTS COMING THROUGH -- AND WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE INTERNATIONAL VISITORS THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE AND ARE YOU ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO ENJOY OUR BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE. AND TO THAT POINT IF I IF I LEAST -- WE ABSOLUTELY THAT THE GREAT ACCESS IT IS ONE PART OF IT BUT ALSO -- THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AND INCLUDE THE BIGGER. PIECES ABOUT WHAT IS FULL AXES MEAN IS IT PARKING IN IS IT TRANSPORTATION IS AT THE RESTAURANT PIECE ALL OF THAT SO I A WANT TO NOTE THAT THE FOR AGENCIES THAT HAVE SIGNED AN AMMO YOU TO WORK TOGETHER OUR STATE LANDS. THE COASTAL COMMISSION OUR COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND PARKS -- IT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE VERY ISSUES AND THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING I THINK THERE'S A BROAD COMMITMENT TO IDENTIFY. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND HOW WE GET FULL ACCESS? VERY GOOD -- WAS THAT IT WAS AN EMOTION OKAY SO. THERE'S A MOTION. ALL I TO CLOSE. COMPLETELY AGREE ON THE GOAL KEEP US INFORMED AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD AND LET US WORK WITH YOU ON THIS. QUESTION AND DEADLINES AND YOU KNOW I I THINK. WE TALK ABOUT IT -- AUTHORIZING AN ADJUSTMENT OF A RECOMMENDATION DRAINAGE ESSENCE OF IN LIEU FEES. THERE ARE OTHERS SORT OF REVENUE CONVERSATION I THINK WE JUST NEED TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES AND HAVE ON A BROADER SCALE HERE WHAT BOND DOLLARS CAN'T DO. AND THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS AMONG OTHERS CAN DO AND I THINK FRANKLY WE DO NEED MORE. THAN AROUND JUST LEFT BUT WE NEED TO MOVE A RESILIENCY BOND -- THIS YEAR I BELIEVE THAT BUT IT'S ONLY GONNA GO SO FAR SO MAYBE IN THE MODEL HERE WE CAN ALSO START TO LOOK AT HOW TO GENERATE THAT KIND OF ACCESS. MEANINGFUL ACCESS REVENUE THAT IT'S GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFER IN THEIR COMMUNITY SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE OPEN ABOUT IT NOT TO FEEL THAT IT'S OPEN ENDED BUT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE ARE GONNA ACTUALLY OF A MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY GET THERE SO. ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE VERY GOOD OTHER MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CENTER STERN HIGH STERN I'D JONES ALLEN FORGES CABALLERO. CABALLERO AYE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON MONNING ON CALL THERE USUALLY THE MEASURE ON CALL THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT.

I HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON MONEY ON CALL IT TOO OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON A DOCTOR QUIRK -- THE MORNING IS YOUR SIR GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND CENTER CABALLERO -- EIGHTY TO NINETY TWO WOULD CHANGE THE TERMS USED FOR RECYCLED WATER. WEEKLY AB TWO NINETY TWO WITH THE LEAD TO TERMS DIRECT POSSIBLE RE USE AN INDIRECT POSSIBLE REVIEWS FOR GROUND WATER RECHARGE CHARGE. AND USE THE FOLLOWING TERMS RALPH WATER AUGMENTATION TREATING TREATED DRINKING WATER AUGMENTATION GROUNDWATER AUGMENTATION. AND WORSE OF OUR LETTER AUGMENTATION. THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TERM POSSIBLE MEANS -- I DIDN'T UNTIL I GOT HERE. MUCH LESS WHAT DIRECTOR INDIRECT WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN. THE WATER AGENCIES THAT IMPLEMENT THESE RECYCLED WATER PROJECTS BELIEVE THAT THIS CHANGE IN TERMS. WOULD HELP THEM PROMOTE WHETHER RECYCLING. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY ADEQUATE MANY WATER AGENCIES AND THERE IS NO OPPOSITION. WITH ME TODAY IS CYRUS FEVERS WITHOUT. LOS VIRGINIS JOINT POWER AUTHORITY AND JENNIFER WEST WITH Y. TO RE USE THANK YOU. MORNING GOOD MORNING -- I AM JENNIFER WEST AND THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF WATER USE CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA IS THE NATION AND WORLD LEADER FOR POTABLE RIOS. AND EDUCATION AND RIGOROUS PUBLIC OUTRAGE IS A CORNERSTONE OF ALL OF THESE PROJECTS. WE SEE THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO GAIN LOCAL SUPPORT CONFIDENCE AND TO OVERCOME THE EVER PRESENT TOILET TO TAP MONIKER. SO WE KNOW THAT IN FACT WORDS MATTER AND CAN BREAK MAKE OR BREAK A PROJECT. WE HAVE LOCAL SURVEY INFORMATION ANECDOTAL STORIES AND INFORMATION FROM PR PROFESSIONALS THAT WORK ON THESE PROJECTS ALL OVER THEIR STATE. AND THEIR INPUT SHOW THAT THE TERMS INDIRECT AND DIRECT JUST ADD TO CONSUMER CONFUSION ABOUT PORTABLE RADIOS. THE IMPORTANCE OF TERMINOLOGY IS ACKNOWLEDGED IN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN EPA REPORT MAINSTREAMING POTABLE REUSE IN THE UNITED STATES. ON PAGE TWENTY ONE OF THIS REPORT IT DISCUSSES THAT WE NEED TO NAME AND IDENTIFY DIFFERENT TYPES OF POTABLE REUSE WATER AND SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT. CALIFORNIA'S AB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR BY SOME WOMEN QUIRK REPRESENTS A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR THE NATION. AB TWO NINE TWO IS  SIMPLE BILL THAT ELIMINATES THESE TERMS INDIRECT AND DIRECT AND ALLOWS US TO MORE CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC USING TERMINOLOGY ESTABLISHED IN AB. FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER THAN SUPPORT. FOR MEMBERS ARE STEAMERS REPRESENTING A LOS REGION AS WATER DISTRICT. AS THE ANALYSIS MAKES CLEAR THAT IT FROM A DISTANCE BETWEEN DIRECT AND INDIRECT IS THE CONCEPT OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL BUFFER. WHICH IS THERE IS SOMETHING IN BETWEEN RECYCLED WATER AND THE CUSTOMER TO SHOW HOW OUTDATED THIS TERM IS BECOME THE PROJECT FROM YOUR DISTRICT APPEAR ONE SYSTEM. IN THAT CASE THE QUOTE UNQUOTE ENVIRONMENTAL BUFFER THE RESERVOIR THAT THE RECYCLE WATER WILL GOING. TO IS ACTUALLY GOING TO CONTAMINATE THE RECYCLED WATER. THE RECYCLED WATER IS COMING OUT TO DRINKING WATER STANDARDS IT'S GONNA BE CONTAMINATED BY THE RESERVOIR AND THEN HAS TO BE TREATED AGAIN BEFORE PEOPLE CAN DRINK. SO IN OTHER WORDS. IN THE AREA WHERE WE CAN DEL THE TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP RECYCLED WATER DRINKING WATER STANDARDS THESE TERMS HAVE BECOME AN ACTOR DISTRICT AND IT'S REALLY. A DISSERVICE TO THE PUBLIC TO KEEP USING THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU. VERY HELPFUL -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BABRI BOMB BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY ELDORADO IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND WATER REPLENISHMENT DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MICHAEL BOCA DORAL ON BEHALF OF THE INLAND EMPIRE UTILITIES AGENCY AND WATER USE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR. EMILY PAPPAS ON BEHALF OF EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IT'S PART. THANKS. I KNOW SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. TO THE HOLE WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES IN SUPPORT. THANKS. JENNIFER WILLIAMS OF THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ROSIE THOMPSON WITH METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT IS IN CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. THE MORNING JOE BOSCO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES AND SUPPORT. THE MORNING GENOCIDE TODAY FOR THE GROUND WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK. YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY WATER THIRTEEN SUPPORT. PROSECUTORS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND SUPPORT. VERY GOOD -- THERE'S IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] SEEING NONE. HAVE ME BACK. TO PRETTY EMPTY DíAS. HE WAS WOULD YOU MIND COMING BACK UP I JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU TO CLARIFY [inaudible] SO. IN THE SPIRIT OF OF THIS MEASURE WHICH IS THAT WORDS MATTER. I APPRECIATE WITH THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO HERE SO I SEE YOU'RE SAYING. BY VIRTUE OF THE NOMENCLATURE USING EXISTING LAW. THE THE PURE PROJECT SORT OF NECESSARILY HAS TO BE REGARDED AS A CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING WATER RESOURCE EVEN THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY. CLEANING THE WATER AND THE SOURCE OF THE CONTAMINATION BEING THE RESERVOIR UNDER THE CURRENT TERMINOLOGY WOULD BE REFERRED TO AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BUFFER. SO A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HEARING THAT TERM IS GONNA THINK BUFFER MEANS SOME LETTER OF PROTECTION. THE FACT IN THE PIER ONE SYSTEM THIS RESERVOIR THIS BEEN AUGMENTED IS ACTUALLY SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION OF THE RECYCLED WATER IT REALLY FLIP THAT ON ITS HEAD THAT'S WHY THESE TERMS ONCE WE CAN DEVELOP THIS TO DRINKING WATER STANDARDS. THESE TERMS REALLY HAVE BECOME OUTDATED. INTERESTING YOU KNOW I I CAME INTO TO BE FRANK WITH THE DOCTOR QUIRK I I CAME INTO A LITTLE SKEPTICAL -- IN TERMS OF JUST THE AMOUNT OF SCHOLARLY RESEARCH THAT HAS OCCURRED IN THE AREA AND AND THIS SORT OF WEIGHT OF PRECEDENT -- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW NOT WANTING. TO TINKER ARBITRARILY. IF YOU WILL -- BUT IF I FIND IT NOT IS ARBITRARY ANYMORE DID YOU I MEAN DID YOU HAVE A A QUICK RESPONSE -- IN TERMS OF THIS THIS CONCERN THOUGH RAISING THE ANALYSIS INTERNAL THE THE THE SORT OF HOW THIS WILL IMPACT SCHOLARLY RESEARCH AND AND WHETHER WE'RE GONNA GET SOME CONFUSION BRED OUT OF THIS OR WHETHER WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE SCHOLARS THEY'LL FIGURE IT. OUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THEY'VE DONE SURVEYS THEY'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE. FRANKLY I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE BEST WAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS I'M RELYING ON THEIR RESEARCH AND IS THAT AND BELIEVE ME I'VE BEEN THE SCHOLAR. THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT SO TO THAT. TO THAT PLAIN TALK FROM A SCHOLAR DID YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU WALK US TROUGH JUST VERY BRIEFLY THAT THE WITH THE RESEARCH DRIVING THIS AND AND SORT OF HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THIS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. HOW ABOUT IF I TAKEN A SHOT AT THAT PLEASE THEM YET THANK YOU SO? YOU KNOW THESE THAT INTERACT IN DIRECT POTABLE REUSE TERMS -- I THINK I THINK THAT THE EVOLUTION OF POTABLE REUSE AND AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING WE ARE IN THE NATION THEY ARE THE NATION AND THE WORLD LEADER FOR PEREA SO. THIS NATION IS LOOKING TO US ON WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE I GO TO CONFERENCES WHERE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW IS THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THESE PROJECTS. AND THE TERMS INDIRECT AND DIRECT HAVE REALLY CREATED. LIKE I SAID THIS THIS KIND OF CONFUSION SO THERE HAS BEEN A NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED TO CHANGE THESE TERMS. AND TO FIND MORE. UNDERSTANDABLE TERMINOLOGY -- YOU KNOW WITH WITH FIVE SEVENTY FOUR WE HAD TO LEAVE THOSE TERMS IN THERE THERE WAS ANOTHER PURPOSE FOR THAT BILL TO DEVELOP THE RAW WATER AUGMENTATION REGULATIONS. THE TERMINOLOGY WAS A PART THAT WE SET FOR LATER THAT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR OUR ORGANIZATION AND FOR THE PR PROFESSIONALS THAT I WORK ON THIS AND I AND I GUESS I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT I MEAN OF ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE ON THE STATE. OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT IS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT INPUT ARRAY OF CINEMAS ANYTHING ELSE WERE DRINKING WATER. RECYCLED WATER WERE EXPLAINING THIS SO THAT WOULD BE MY URGING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TERMINOLOGY PARTICULARLY FOR THIS TYPE OF RECYCLED WATER. AND WATER SOURCE AND SO AND IS THE PUBLIC RESPONDING TO THE TERM I MEAN EVERYONE LOVES LIKE. RAW VEGETABLES AND RAW YOU KNOW EVERY FANCY HEALTH FOOD STORE YOU GO TO SO IT MEANS THAT PART OF THE YEAH I MEAN LOGIC IS IT IT DOESN'T. SO WHEN ORINDA STILL WORKS COUNTY WATER DISTRICT WHO'S THAT WHO HAVE DID IT DONE TOWARDS FIVE THOUSAND PLUS PER -- THEY HAVE TOWARDS COME THE OF PEOPLE COME TO TOWARD THEIR FACILITY. THE INDIRECT AND DIRECT THEY THEY SURVEYED THEM AFTERWARDS AND THAT THAT'S NOT HELPFUL IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE DIRECT. IMPLIES THAT THERE'S LESS TREATMENT I MEAN THAT'S JUST NATURAL -- SO WE SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT THEY ARE THEY USE THE SURVEY INFORMATION AND THAT THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL -- TO TO ASCERTAIN THAT'S ONE PLACE WHERE WE GET THE INFORMATION BUT AS I SAID P. R. PROFESSIONALS ARE WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS ALL OVER THE STATE. THEY HAVE LITTLE FOCUS GROUPS AND THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT MAKES SENSE TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT POTABLE RE ISN'T WHAT IS ACCURATE. AND IN THE CONTEXT THE TERMS ON AB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR MAKE THE MOST SENSE UNDERSTOOD. OKAY WELL -- THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A MOTION BUT I WOULD ENTERTAINMENT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME SO I'LL LET YOU TO CLOSE DR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN PEOPLE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS. AND WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED FLY AND TO **** MEANING. THE WATER GOES DIRECT FROM THE READ TREATMENT PROGRAM TO CLEAN UP THE THE SO CALLED WAR BRAWL WATER WHICH IS COMING IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AND YOUR ATTEMPTED THE P. R.. MOVE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- OKAY WE WE WILL -- WAIT FOR MEMBERS TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THAT MEASURE IT BUT AT PRESENT LET ME JUST LOOK IN OUR WE HAVE A SIMILAR MCCARTY HERE I BELIEVE A FILE ITEM NUMBER. FOUR THE ME SEES THAT IT. VERY GOOD YES WELCOME GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. BRING MY WITNESSES UP. OKAY GOOD MORNING FIRST I WANT. TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US FOR A COUPLE WEEKS AND WE PUT THIS BILL OVER TO MAKE SURE WE GOT A RIGHT I THINK WE DO SO. FOR THIS BILLS RELATED TO OUR COURTS ARE GREAT CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. THAT CREATED BY OUR FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN WITH A GREAT SLOGAN CRUMMY CONDITIONS AND LOW PAY WHO WOULD WANT THAT BUT IT'S REALLY. A PHENOMENAL PROGRAM MODERN UP TO MODERN AFTER THIS CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS CREATED DURING THE GREAT. DEPRESSION. COR MEMBERS LEARN SKILLS SUCH AS FORESTRY MANAGEMENT ENERGY AUDITING INSULATION EMERGENCY AT A CAN ALSO EARN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA SAID ALSO IS A CRITICAL ROLE. IN HELPING INDIVIDUALS WHO FRANKLY WERE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM GET GET THEIR AND GET THEIR YOU KNOW ON THE RIGHT FOOT IN THAT IT HAD A KID START IN THEIR CAREER. SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO THIS WOULD BUILD UPON A LOT COUPLE YEARS AGO WHICH I WORKED ON WHICH ALLOWS PEOPLE ON PROBATION TO BE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE NOT AUTOMATICALLY TO BE ELIGIBLE SO THIS WILL NOT PEOPLE ON PROBATION. AND PAROLE THAT'S THE CHANGE SO THEY WOULD BE CERTAINLY OPS -- OPTIONAL THIS WOULD ALLOW BUT NOT REQUIRED. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CORE AND ALSO LOCAL COURSE TO CONSIDERS INDIVIDUALS -- WITH THE WITH OF COURSE THE INPUT FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE PAROLE AGENTS AND SO FORTH -- SO THIS IS NO OPPOSITION WITH ME IS AN INDIVIDUAL FROM OUR LOCAL COR JORDAN ROBERSON AS WELL AS READ ADDIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL COURSE. JORDAN GOOD THANK YOU GOOD MORNING WELCOME JOINT MORNING. FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JORDAN ROBERSON. I WAS BORN IN MAY THE CALIFORNIA I GRADUATED FROM COULD OVER HIGH SCHOOL.

A BETTER FEELING OF GETTING SOMETHING THE RIGHT WAY ENOUGH SAID. THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ OUT US ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS IS HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH PEOPLE LIKE JORDAN. ON A DAILY BASIS. THE REASON WE'RE HERE IN TODAY TODAY IN SUPPORT IS BECAUSE MANY OF THE LOCAL CORES ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO WORK WITH PEOPLE LIKE JORDAN. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE ONE CORD THAT IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND AS HE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS POINTED OUT THE STATE CORES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT. WE'RE OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS TRYING TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS FOR INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THIS POPULATION TO ENTER THE WORKFORCE THE LOCAL COURTS DO THAT BY BOTH PROVIDING EDUCATION AND JOB TRAINING. WHEN IT COMES TO PAROLEES IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO PLACE THEM IN JOBS ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS SENATOR WAY SAYS WORKING ON AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR THAT? WHAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY'S BILL DOES IS IT BREAKS IT TAKES DOWN THE BARRIER OF A LEGAL ISSUE WHICH IS A STATE CORPS AND AGAIN ONE OF OUR LOCAL COURSES NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY BRING THESE FOR A LEE? THE IT MEMBERS INTO THE PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEREFORE WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT HERE. SEEING NINE ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING BACK TO THE DíAS FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION OR WELL. JUST TO NOTIFY HOPEFUL CONGRADULATIONS. FOR SITTING HERE IN THE CAPITAL TODAY. BACK FROM WHERE YOU WERE TWO YEARS AGO. QUITE A PATH. TELL ME. IF YOU COULD WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DOING OUT THERE WHAT WHAT I CONSTRUCTION WORK GENERAL LABOR. HE SAID THE INTERESTING THING IN YOUR CLOTHES AS I TELL YOU WHEN HE READ THE NOTES ANYMORE WE SAID DOING. DOING THE HARD THINGS IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEKING NOW IS OPPOSE THE EASY THINGS HE CONNELL MORE ON THE LIKE. SELLIN DRUGS OR TRYING TO GET A EASY MONEY. RATHER THAN GOING TO WORK YOU KNOW. PLAN IN EIGHT HOURS A DAY. YOU KNOW WAITING FOR YOUR MONEY WHICH COMES LIFE REALLY TO YOURSELF AND IT'S YOURS. THE CLAIM. PRETTY MUCH LIKE. WORKING IN A STABLE SYSTEM WHERE YOU'RE DOING THINGS TO SUPPORT YOURSELF THE RIGHT WAY. AND IT YEAH IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT SPEED OF OF YOU KNOW RWARD RIGHT DOESN'T COME AS FAST BUT I MEAN THAT THE HOPE HERE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM. JUDGES BASED ON CHARACTER. AND WORK ETHIC AND NOT JUST BECAUSE OF SOME DECISIONS YOU MADE I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS FORWARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND TO IN THAT WORK IS. BELIEVE IN A LOT OF TALENT ON THE TABLE TO IN THIS STATE IN TERMS PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR CONSERVATION OUTCOMES AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER PROFESSIONS [inaudible] TO CHARACTER COUNTS. A GUIDE YOU WITH THE MISTAKES YOU MADE THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS BUT I APPRECIATE IS TRYING TO BUST THROUGH SOME OF THESE BARRIERS AND GIVE A LITTLE BIT AT DAYLIGHT HERE -- THANKS FOR DOING THAT AND WORK FOR WORKING WITH A COMMITTEE TO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THAT DISCRETION IS CLEAR. AND THAT IS DIRECTLY TO BE RIGOROUS AND JUST FIND THE BEST THE BEST AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DRIVE THE PROCESS APPRECIATE THAT. UNDERMINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEGES WASN'T HERE TO HEAR THE AUTHORS OPENING THAT. SHE DID THE TESTIMONY OF OF BOTH THE WITNESSES. I ASSUME YOU'RE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT THAT INNING AND ANALYSIS. CORRECT AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION RELATES TO THAT. ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIED CRIMES THAT WOULD DISQUALIFY. APPROVAL ONLY UNDER THE AMENDED BILL FROM BEING CONSIDERED OR SIT ALL. NOW UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE DIRECTOR. I THINK HOW WE HOW WE HOW WE WROTE THE ON THE AMENDMENT AND MAYBE. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT COULD CORRECT IF I'M WRONG. IS THAT -- THEY WOULD ALL BE UNDER DISCRETION THAT THE WEED WE DO LIST -- ONE ONE ONE INCIDENT IN THE PENAL CODE TO NINETY IN THOSE OFFENSES TO BE. LOOKED INTO TOTAL CONSIDERATION WITH THE DIRECTOR AND OF COURSE THE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO EVALUATE EACH CANDIDATE. I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY I I REALLY SUPPORT. THE OBJECTIVE HERE I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT. CERTAIN SPECIFIED CRIMES. CHILD MOLESTATION -- OTHER CRIMES THAT. EVEN IF PERSONS DONE THEIR TIME THERE MAY BE A PROPENSITY THERE THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE A GOOD MIX WORKING. WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE CONSERVATION CORPS AND WELL IN THIS. THE AUTHORITY IN THE DIRECTOR IT SEEMS IT INVESTS ALL THAT DISCRETION. WITH THE DIRECTOR SO I JUST HAVE SOME CONCERNS I THINK WE WANT TO FIND A BALANCE THAT PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE LIKE IS IT JORDAN THE SENTENCING YOU KNOW A PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE WHO. WHO WERE LOOKING TO GET THEIR FEET ON THE GROUND IN BUILD FUTURE? BUT I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE THE GOOD WORK -- OF THE CONSERVATION CORPS POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED BY SOME. OVERZEALOUS EFFORT. TO TO FILL POSITIONS OR GRANT PAROLEES SLOTS THAT MAY TAKE A SLICE FROM A THE YOUNG PERSON. WHO HASN'T HAD ANY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO THOSE ARE JUST MY CONCERNS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY REASSURANCE FROM THE CHAIR OR THE AUTHOR? I'M AND I'M HAPPY TO WIN BECAUSE WE WE WRESTLED WITH THAT EXACT ISSUE I THINK THAT I APPRECIATE ACTUALLY SO MEMBER GIVEN US A LITTLE TIME TO WORK ON THIS THAT'S WHY WE HELD IT OVER AND SORT OF WORKED ON IT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS -- THE THE IT'S A MANDATORY CONSIDERATION NOW IN THE PROCESS THINGS LIKE -- PENAL CODE TO NINETY WHICH YOU MENTIONED. AND LIFETIME PAROLE -- ISSUES. THE I THINK THE WAY THIS BILL IS STRUCTURED [inaudible] DEMANDS -- A SORT OF COMMITMENTS OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTATION ON OUR END AND I THINK I'VE HEARD FROM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOU CAN CHIME IN IF YOU LIKE BUT AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. I KNOW WE'RE COMMITTED TO CLOSELY MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION. HEY I THINK THE RESOURCE ARE STILL STRIPPED SO THERE WILL BE LIMITED SLOTS AND FORTUNE I THINK THERE'S MORE WORK TO DO. AND MORE WORK FORCE EXPANSION FRANKLY IT'S NEEDED IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT'S A LIMITED SET OF CHOICES BUT I ALSO OUR SENSE FROM. THE THE CCC AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR IS THAT -- THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A SORT OF WAITING OF THIS SCALE -- OUT YOU KNOW A PENDING. OTHER QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AS WELL WHO DON'T HAVE THIS PAST THIS SIMPLE POINT IS IF YOU DO QUALIFY -- ON ON CHARACTER ON HARD WORK AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION IS YOUR FITNESS TO JOIN THE COR PUBLIC SAFETY ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES. YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THAT RIGOROUS TEST I THINK JORDAN SAID THE BEST THE BEST -- YOU MAKE IT THROUGH THE TEST. YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE BUT WE HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION THAT THE DIRECTOR GOING TO WAIVE THESE FACTORS HEAVILY THAT WE'VE OUTLINED HERE -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ON THAT BUT YEAH THAT I THINK THAT WAS THE THE THE GOAL WE'VE SEEN THIS DURING THE PROBATION CHANGE THAT WE VOTED ON AND AN ACTIVE. THREE YEARS AGO. BUT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC ACCEPTANCE THIS IS A VERY COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IT SOUGHT AFTER. FRANKLY WE SHOULD BE GROWING THE THE CORE WE WE HAVE BEEN WITH SOME OF THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY LAST FOR YEARS FOCUSING ON OUR STATE PRIORITIES AND IT HELPS WITH ISSUES THEY WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH LIKE THEIR RECIDIVISM ISSUE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE BACK. INTO THE MAINSTREAM AND THE IRONY IS YOU YOU CAN AS YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE. IN STATE PRISON RIGHT NOW AND BE ABLE TO GO WORK ON THE FIRES THREE YEAR PRISON SENTENCE. AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE RELEASED ON PAROLE YOU WANT TO JOIN A PROGRAM LIKE THE COR DO THE SAME TYPE OF WORK AND MAYBE KERN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA -- GET SOME EXPERIENCE GET A PIPELINE TO CAREER LIKE NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU CAN DO ONE WHEN YOU'RE INCARCERATED BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE OUT SO. IT'S JUST - SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN THIS WOULD ALLOW -- FLEXIBILITY FOR THE DIRECTORS TO DETERMINE WHAT APPLICANTS AND MEET THAT HIGHER THRESHOLD. THANK YOU AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I'LL JUST FINISH WITH A SHOUT OUT TO THE CORE THAT PROVIDED. TREMENDOUS SUPPORT IN OUR BIG SUR AREA WHEN WE LOST TO BRIDGE FOLLOWING THE STORMS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IN. THE CORPS CONSTRUCTED AN EMERGENCY. TRAIL IN SIX WEEKS WE ORIGINALLY TOLD IT WOULD BE A SEVEN YEAR PLANNING PROCESS THROUGH STATE PARKS. THEY GET IT DONE IN SIX WEEKS IN THE CORE MOVE SOME TEAMS AROUND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. FULL TIME SUPPORT SO -- I'M WELL AWARE OF THE TREMENDOUS WORK. THE CORE DOES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HOW ARE YOU TO CLOSE NO I THINK IT WOULD HIT ALL'S DURING THAT BACK AND FORTH TO SENATOR MONEY -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK TRAVEL GOOD. SO HAVING AID EXCEPT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE MOTION WOULD BE DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS I WON ENTERTAINMENT OR WE CAN WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A I WE DO HAVE A CORE. YEAH BUT OKAY VERY GOOD -- VERY GOOD THANK YOU CENTER MORNINGS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. KALRA SENATOR STERN HI STERN AYE JONES ALAN ORANGES CABALLERO HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON MONNING. MONEY NINE THE BILLS ON CALL. OKAY WILL LEAVE THE MEASURE CALL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY GOOD LUCK OUT THERE. DOESN'T TAKE A LOT THOUGH JUST GO SWEAT. NINETY WORK THANK YOU SIR. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S SEE FILE ORDER HERE [inaudible] FOR OBERNOLTE AND WINS THE WINS THE PRIZE -- I'M SORRY IT WILL COVER KNOWN OVERNIGHT YES MISERABLE. NINETY FILE ITEM. SIX EIGHTY THREE NINETY FOUR AND THEN MISTER KALRA NAY MISTER GRAY. MY APOLOGIES. THREE NINETY FOUR IS THAT CORRECT YES OKAY VERY GOOD I LIGHT A PRESENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I'M SURE EVERYONE IN THE ROOM IS AWARE OF THE INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE CAMPFIRES OF LAST YEAR. THAT WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY ALSO THE DEADLIEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY EARLIER THIS YEAR -- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR THE DEVASTATED TOWN OF PARADISE AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY POIGNANT EXPERIENCE FOR ME. TO SEE THE DEVASTATION THAT WAS WROUGHT IN THAT COMMUNITY. TO ME THE MOST SURPRISING FACT OF THAT ENTIRE VISIT WAS TESTIMONY THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WERE THERE IN PARADISE. THE DAY OF THE FIRE. AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW ALL OF THE EGRESS ROUTES OUT OF PARADISE WERE COMPLETELY CLOGGED BECAUSE THE WILDFIRE HAD MOVED SO RAPIDLY IN FACT THEY TOLD US ABOUT PEOPLE SHELTERING IN PLACE IN THEIR CARS. IN INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE WIDEST PLACE THOSE PEOPLE COULD FIND TO GET AWAY FROM THE FLAMES UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE SURVIVED BUT WE WILL NOT BE THAT LUCKY. AGAIN. PARADISE HAS FOR EGRESS ROUTES AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE WERE COMPLETELY CLOGGED THE DAY OF THE FIRE. I REPRESENT A LOT OF PLACES IN OF MY DISTRICT THAT HAVE EVEN WORSE EGRESS THE GROUCH THAN THAT IN FACT WHERE I LIVE IN THE CITY OF BIG BEAR LAKE WE ONLY HAVE THREE EGRESS ROUTES. SOME PLACES HAVE EVEN TWO OR ONE THE COMMUNITY OF IDYLLWILD WHICH I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH HAS ONLY ONE EGRESS ROUTE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE DEVASTATION THAT WOULD BE WROUGHT. IF A SIMILAR WILDFIRE WITH THROUGH THERE THIS BILL AB THREE NINETY FOUR CREATES A VERY NARROWLY CRAFTED EXEMPTION TO SEEK WORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF EGRESS PROJECTS IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY. WE'VE GONE THROUGH A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES HERE TAKING AMENDMENTS AT EACH STAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CRAFTING A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT STRIKES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE NEED TO PROTECT. THE ENVIRONMENT TO BE DELIBERATE ABOUT PROJECTS ON THE ONE HAND AND THE NEED TO CREATE THESE BADLY NEEDED. HE CHRIS ROUTES ON THE OTHER SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL YOU KNOW WHAT AND I I MIGHT SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MISTER CHAIR. FOR BY YOUR WORK ON THIS -- BILL WE CERTAINLY WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH -- PLEASE WRITE AT JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC ON BEHALF OF THE WORLD COUNTIES ARE COUNTIES CONTAINED THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S FOREST LANDS AND WE'VE SEEN. A LOT OF THE MOST RECENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN OUR JURISDICTION. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S A MODEST STEP FORWARD TO IMPROVING IGRE S. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A SECONDARY EGRESS ROUTE. IT'S BUILT UPON AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN FROM LAST YEAR THAT WAS A FRIEDMAN BUILDER REQUIRES THE BOARD OF FORESTRY TO GO OUT AND IDENTIFY THOSE COMMUNITIES LACKING A SECOND EGRESS ROUTE -- AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON PROJECTS TO IMPROVE SAFETY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THIS BILL PROVIDES AN ERA SEQUEL EXEMPTION IT DOES PROVIDE A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS PROTECTING SPECIES PROTECTING HABITATS -- PROTECTING WATER COURSES RIPARIAN AREAS -- REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH THE FORCE PRACTICES ACT -- PROTECTS HISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND DOESN'T EXEMPT ANY OF THESE PROJECTS FROM ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT ARE ON THE BOOKS TODAY -- SO WE THINK THIS IS NARROWLY TAILORED BUT WILL PROVIDE A NUMBER OF BENEFITS TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND SUBDIVISIONS. YES ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. YOUR SINGLE PARTY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RESEARCHER CHRIS MY KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF MENDOCINO AND HUMBLED REDWOOD COMPANIES ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANKS SO MUCH. CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

I WAS IN SUPPORT [inaudible] TING. NINE DO ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING. NINE CAN BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS ALTHOUGH WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO -- DO YOU MIND I DON'T NEED TO CALL YEAH BUT I DID HAVE A QUICK QUESTION MAYBE THE AUTHOR CAN HELP CLARIFY TO I KNOW WE WRESTLED. WITH THIS ISSUE A BIT ANY CUSA SOME OF IT IS GERMANE AND SOME NOT TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT JUST IN TERMS OF THAT. THE LOCAL APPROVAL PROCESS AND HOW IT WAS SORT OF STAGE ITSELF OUT BOTH IN SAN DIEGO AND RURAL COUNTIES CAN YOU GUYS CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH -- PROCESS SAFE. CENTER ALLEN ARE BOTH IN LA COUNTY I THINK WE'VE GOT -- ON A REYES AND BARBARA -- HOW HOW DID HOW OLD IS ACTUALLY FUNCTION -- SO NO SEQUEL PROCESS BUT THERE IS A PROVISION TALK ABOUT LEADING AGENCY DETERMINATION OF OF IT AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING BUT ALSO ALL LOCAL APPROVAL SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THOSE LOCAL APPROVALS BEING AND JUST. WATER SO WHAT THE PROCESS ADAM WE ARE INCLUDING -- PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND A HEARING ON THIS WHERE COMMENTS ARE RECEIVED AND RESPONDED TO BY THE LOCAL AGENCY -- SO THE PROCESS REALLY STARTS AND BOARD OF FORESTRY THEY IDENTIFY THE COMMUNITIES THEY RECOMMEND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE -- FROM THAT POINT FORWARD IT WOULD BE UP TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT OR NOT -- I'M SURE SOME LOCALS WILL NEED SOME RESOURCES SOME MAY HAVE THE RESOURCES IN PLACE SOME MAY BE SEEKING MORE RESOURCES FROM THE STATE -- SO FROM THAT DECISION POINT I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT NOT THAT LOCAL DID WHEN THEY CHOOSE OR NOT IS THAT THAT'S ABOUT OF SOME KIND OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT DOES IT IT SORT OF DEPENDS ON THE EXISTING USE OF THAT. THAT EGRESS THROUGH LIKE IF THERE'S ALREADY EXISTING FIRE ROAD SAY RIGHT AND SO THERE COULD BE AN EXISTING FIRE ROAD -- THAT IS EITHER CLOSED OFF ITS UNPAVED ON IMPROVED -- IT'S CLOSED SO PEOPLE CAN'T USE IT -- SO THERE COULD BE A MINOR PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS IS THAT A MINISTERIAL DECISION THERE OR WOULD THAT BE A DISCRETIONARY ONE FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT JUST USE FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WITH FIRE ROADS GOING ALL THROUGHOUT. AND THAT THAT WAS MY CENTRAL CONCERN IN ANY QUEUE TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH THIS. IT WAS LIVES ON THE LINE. WE GET THAT THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF MEAN GO SOMEWHERE LIKE TO PAY A CANYON AND YOU KNOW THAT FIRE HITS WRONG DESPITE ALL THE PREPARATIONS DONE. WE MAY LOSE LIFE. THERE'S A V. ARE VERY REAL OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE'S ALSO ALL THESE WINDING FIRE ROADS ALL THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY -- BOTH IN ANY CORPORATION DâN INCORPORATED AREAS SO JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THAT THIS IS. YEAH IT'S IT'S PROBABLY TRUE IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WELL BUT IS THERE A DISCRETIONARY DECISION THAT THAT THAT THAT COUNTY. GOVERNMENT WOULD BE MAKING IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND AND WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WITHOUT SEEK HUESO THERE VERY WELL COULD BE -- AND WOULD GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PLANNING PROCESSES FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO NORMAL APPROVAL PROCESSES -- THE ONLY THING THAT WE'RE DOING AS EXEMPTING THESE PROJECTS FROM SEEK WAS SO -- THAT'S A BIT OF INSULATION FROM POTENTIAL LITIGATION AND IT'S ALSO SAVING RESOURCES FOR THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS -- AND DELAYS THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARING DOCUMENTS AND LITIGATION -- SO YOU'D STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH AND OBTAIN ANY OTHER PERMITS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE S. R. THE IT DEPENDS ON THE PROJECT SO. SO I'M SAYING TAKE A THE IF THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY IMPACT TO A WATER CORES -- YOU MIGHT HAVE TO LOOK AT STRING THAT ALTERATION PERMITS AND MITIGATING ANY IMPACT. WE'VE TRIED TO BUILD AND BUFFERS AND TO THE BILL THAT BASICALLY SAY THE PROJECT CAN'T CONTAIN A WETLANDS ARE RIPARIAN AREA -- SO WITH RESPECT TO ESSAYS AND PERMITS UNDER THE ESSAY -- FOR THOSE SPECIES THE PROJECTS CAN'T IMPACTS THOSE SPECIES SO IT DEPENDS ON STATE PERMITS OR TALKING TO STREAM THAT ALTERATION PERMITS AND SO THOSE WOULD BE STATE PERMITS ESA AT YEAH AND I MENTIONED YESTERDAY I MENTIONED. YOU SEE SO -- YEAH SURE -- SO THERE COULD BE STATE PERMITS ANY LOCAL PERMITS THAT MIGHT APPLY -- MAYBE SENATOR CAN SPEAK MORE TO ENSURE MORE URBAN KIND OF COUNTY JUST GIVE GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE SO JOHN THE CAN DOWN THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO MORE URBAN BUT WE HAVE A HUGE BACK COUNTRY ARE IN. FACT WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE A DECADE AGO ON A HOLLINGSWORTH TO CHENEY BILL WERE. LOOK AT SIMILAR CONCEPT OF TRYING -- TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DO BRUSH CLEARANCE AND OTHER THINGS AROUND EGRESS IDENTIFIED EGRESS AND FIRE SAFETY ROUTES FOR COMMUNITIES -- SO FROM THAT AGAIN IT WAS A GOOD LOOKING AT SEA CA TRYING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESSAT THAT POINT IS BECAUSE WE HAD OUR OF FUNDS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR BRUSH CLEARANCE -- AND WE'D EXPORTED BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEEKS AGO OUT THIS HETHER YOU DO A MASTERY AYE ARE. AND THEN TEAR PROJECTS OFF OF THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTINGTHIS WE THINK THIS IT'S BEEN SOMETHING AS THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE STRUGGLED WITH AND WE THINK THIS MAKES AS IS A GOOD BALANCE AND MAKES IT -- SENSE BUT THERE ARE I'M NOT A BELIEVER SO ALL THE LOCAL PERMITS BUT I THINK -- MISTER KENNEDY REALLY HAD ON IT THAT THERE'S A WHOLE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO. THIS FROM THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO'S PERSPECTIVE WE ALSO WOULD IDENTIFY THESE THERE ARE FIRE IT'S ALREADY -- THERE BE THE PUBLIC NOTICING THE PUBLIC -- HEARINGS THAT I'D SAY THAT IDENTIFICATION BY THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTS OF THE COUNTY ITSELF HAS ALREADY. IDENTIFIED BY THE I DON'T KNOW I I DON'T I HAVE TO FIND OUT AND GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT I THINK OUR FIRE RESTORED HE DOES IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL EGRESS ROUTES FOR COMMUNITIES. BUT I CAN BE I CAN VERIFY THAT AND GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. DID YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT I I I'M TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE TO THIS ISSUE AROUND -- USING EGRESS AS A PROXY FOR DEVELOPMENT -- AND AND TRYING TO SORT OF PREVENT. THAT BACK DURING ESSENTIALLY OF NEW DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE GOING IN. WHEN WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO WITH HIS CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE AND IT'S HARD TO SAY OKAY NOW YOUR BILL TO ROAD? YOU CAN'T USE IT FOR ANYTHING ELSE BUT LEAVING DURING A FIRE THAT'S JUST PROBABLY NOT HOW IT'S GOING TO BE I THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT YOU BROUGHT UP AND I THINK. TO BE CLEAR. THESE PROJECTS DO NOT PERCOLATE UP FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S THE OPPOSITE THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY IDENTIFIES. THE AYE COMMUNITIES IN PROJECTS THAT HAVE INSUFFICIENT EGRESS AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY PROJECTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE LIMITED SEQUEL EXEMPTION THAT THIS BILL -- THAT THIS BILL OFFERS AND THEN IT WOULD REQUIRE. PARTICIPATION AND BY AND FROM THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO SAY FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW YES WE'RE GOING TO UNDERTAKE THIS PROJECT SO IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A COLLABORATION AND BOTH PARTIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE AND AS WAS TESTIFIED -- THERE'S PUBLIC INPUT IN THIS PROCESS TO THE BILL REQUIRES PUBLIC HEARINGS BEFORE THAT WOMEN EXEMPTION IS GRANTED. UNDERSTOOD. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL I MEAN I THE MAIN THING IS I WANT I WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAINTAIN DISCRETION FOR COUNTY OR CITY TO SAY YOU KNOW. UP TO THE BOARD OF FORESTRY THIS MAY MAKE SENSE BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE HERE. THERE'S TOO MANY RISKS IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION TO HAVE THAT DISCRETION TO SAY [inaudible] YEAH. WHERE WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE AND WE'RE NOT -- I THINK WE'LL MATTER I'M I'M STILL OPEN THOUGH HERE BUT I DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE DIES AT I THINK THAT THE REASON I I YOU KNOW I SHARE YOUR CONCERN AYE AYE I CERTAINLY THINK [inaudible] I'M. AYE AYE AYE IT'S NOT WHAT I I GUESS IS THERE HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO TRYING TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE INTENT AS STATED BY THE AUTHOR. IS REALLY GONNA BE AFFECTION WAITED HERE BECAUSE I I SHARE YOUR CONCERN. I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY LIMITED AND SPECIAL SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR THAT'S WHY DON'T HAVE OPPOSITION FROM RIGHT ARMENIANS IN THE REMOTE COMMUNITY. YEAH NOT NOT TO FLIP IT BACK -- BUT THE AS THE CHAIR VQ I THINK YOUR JURISDICTION ALL OVER THIS SEQUEL ISSUES IS SORT OF THE THE AT LEAST JURISDICTION ONLY THE THE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO TO PUT THAT CHECK -- I WAS AND I I DON'T WE WOULDN'T BE UPSET IF YOU. AYE AYE. YEAH. YEAH WELL WE CAN WORK TOGETHER YOU -- TO ONE ROAD PLAY TOO MUCH. FROM THE DIS HERE BUT I I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE YOU GIVEN THOUGHT TO THIS AND SORT OF HOW TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT THE LIMITS ARE THE CONSTRAINTS ARE SO THAT WE CAN. SORT OF MAINTAIN THAT DICRETION AND I'M THINKING A MULTI ROADS RECOMMENDATIONS COMING IN. TO THIS IS IN AMOUNTS SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS REDUCE GO I MEAN THERE'S IT'S GOING TO KEEP COMING UP WITH MEMBERS TO JUST HOW TO GET THAT REASSURANCE BUILT INTO THIS FRAMEWORK -- YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO THAT ANY BUILT IN SUSPENDERS FOR INSTANCE SAY. TO THAT -- THE B. B. TWELVE SEEMS LIKE THE MOST -- RIGOROUS PORTION IN TERMS OF WHERE THE LEAD AGENCY DETERMINES THE PROJECT IS A PAIN THERE IS ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY FUNDING AND ANY STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL APPROVAL AND LOCAL APPROVALS WITHIN ONE YEAR THE FILING. IT IS YOURS IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE THAT WE CAN SORT OF DUE. TO MAKE CLEAR THEY'RE STILL DISCRETION FOR LOCAL STATUS SAY NO PROBLEM IN LOOK IS SOMEONE WHO CAME UP FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A LOT OF US DID I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THE AND THAT FORMER LOCAL CONTROL. AND WE TOOK WE CRAFTED THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE LOCAL BY AND AND HONESTLY I CAN'T IMAGINE. HOW A PROJECT LIKE THIS WOULD EVER BE DONE AND ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT? THE ACTIVE ADVOCACY NOT JUST THE DAHLE TACIT APPROVAL BUT THE ACTIVE ADVOCACY OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES INVOLVED SO I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANYTHING THAT THAT WOULD ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS I THINK THAT THE BILL AS WRITTEN. ALREADY MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE LEAD AGENCY IS A LOCAL AGENCIES THIS ISN'T THE STATE COMING AND SAYING YOU MUST DO THIS -- BUT A I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS. I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S THE CRITICAL POINT FROM A FROM A SEQUEL PERSPECTIVE LEAD AGENCY IS STILL LOCAL -- SELECTION PROCESS IN ELIGIBILITY PROCESS COMES ON BOARD OF FORESTRY. BUT THAT DISCRETION STILL ESSENTIALLY LIES WITH THE LEAD AGENCY TO SAY. YES IN THE FIRST PLACE -- OKAY ABSOLUTELY -- THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. BRINGING THIS FORWARD YOU MADE THE REFERENCE TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN PARADISE. I'D ALSO HEARD THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME PLANNING. TO HAVE A BUFFER ZONES ALONG AT LEAST ONE ESCAPE GROUP WHERE THEY TURNED. TWO LANES INTO BOTH EXIT LANE SENATE THAT ADVANCE PLANNING ACTUALLY DID RESULT IN SAVING LIVES IN PARADISE AND WELL. IT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T ENOUGH TO SAVE. THE LIVES THAT PERISHED FROM. IT DOES PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF THE IMPORTANCE -- IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH HIGHER. DEATH TOLL. I JUST THINK GIVEN OUR CURRENT CRISIS IN THIS STATE AND HOPEFULLY. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE MORE. DAY STORIES THIS FIRE SEASON. WE NEED TO GET MOVING ON THIS IN FAMILIES NEED TO BE EDUCATED IN THE PROCESS IS WELL. YOU KNOW WE IN EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE SUPPLIES. COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WITH FAMILY ETCETERA WELL WE NEED TO UP THAT. VIGILANCE IN. IN FAMILIES REALLY NEED TO BE EDUCATED S. THESE. GRASSROOTS ARE DEVELOPED SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD READY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. ARM THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT I WOULD JUST ASK. THE BILL MOVES FOR TODAY. pWITH THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY AYE AYE I KNOW IT'S A BIG COMMITMENT IT AFTER MAKING BUT TO LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S ANY BELT AND SUSPENDERS WE NEED TO PUT ON THIS. AND ESPECIALLY PENDING SOME OF THAT FEEDBACK I THINK FROM COUNTY SAN DIEGO I'D LIKE TO KNOW FROM LA COUNTY. WHERE THEY SIT WITH THIS? BEFORE WE BRING THIS THING ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND GO FOR IT. SO I DID I THINK THE DILIGENCE WILL BE IMPORTANT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO MEET SO MANY ANTICIPATED BACKLASH AND MAKE CLEAR. WHAT THIS BILL IS AND WHAT IT ISN'T? RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM REALTORS AN APARTMENT ASSOCIATION BUILDING INDUSTRY BUT THAT SENDS A CERTAIN SIGNAL IT SAYS LIKE. YOUR BILL THIS IS ABOUT BUILDING AND WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAYING THIS ABOUT FORCE YOU TO TERMINATION ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. SO -- ARE YOU OPEN TO TO THAT SHOULD THE BILL FOR JUST TRYING TO THINK THROUGH SOME. WAIT IS SIR TO SHORE UP THIS THIS LEADING. ZERO IF THE CONCERN IS THAT. THE BOARD WOULD FORCE ONE OF THESE IGRICE PROJECTS ON A COMMUNITY AND A LEAD AGENCY THAT DID NOT WANT IT. THAT. THAT THIS IS ONLY INTENDED TO BE DONE WHEN THERE'S A COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BOARD AND THE LOCAL AGENCIES SO I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH I THINK YOU ARE. I THINK YOU YOU JUST THAT INTENSE CLARIFYING THAT INTENT I THINK WOULD BE EVERYTHING THAT CONCISE STATEMENT YOU MADE THERE SO MAYBE WE CAN EVEN JUST WORK ON THAT FINDING AT THE DOOR. OKAY VERY GOOD. WELL -- I WOULD ENTERTAIN THEM I THINK THERE WAS A MOTION CENTER MINING OR FROM THE VICE CHAIR. AND THE VICE -- ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WAS THERE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR PLEASE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST BEROSSUS CASH IN ON THIS. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW POIGNANT EXPERIENCE WAS TO TO BE IN PARADISE AND HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHELTERING IN INTERSECTIONS IN FIELDS BECAUSE ALL OF THE EGRESS ROUTES WERE CLOGGED. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. AGAIN AND OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE EVEN WORSE YOU KRISTIN PARADISE IN THIS IS JUST A SMALL STEP IN THAT DIRECTION SO I'D URGE ON AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MANY NUMBER AND LET ME SAY I'LL I'LL BE SUPPORTER TODAY -- RESERVING THE RIGHT UP FOR THE FLOOR DILIGENCE DONE. TO TO TO CHANGE THAT BUT I THINK FOR FOR PURPOSES OF GOOD FAITH HERE YOU MADE QUITE AN EFFORT SAYS THANK YOU FOR THAT -- THE MOTION IS BEFORE US -- AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS -- SO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL UNDERSTAND HI STERN AYE JONES JONES I ALLEN. ALLEN AYE FORGES CABALLERO COMING ERA AYE HERTZBERG PLEASE SO JACKSON MONEY. MONEY NINE TO HIS. OKAY A PHONE CALL LEAVE A MEASURE OF CALL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THINK MISTER KALRA. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVEN MEMBERS FOR THOSE FALLING ON TV. FOR FIFTY FOUR DEGREES SHERIFF DOT TO PRESENT IT SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR WHICH ADDRESS THE DANGERS LOOPHOLE IN CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE PROTECTION LAW. THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS. TO THE BILL REMOVE OPPOSITION FROM GROUPS OF SENDING OUT CULTURE ON TIMBER INTERESTS AS WELL AS A SORT INDUSTRY IN THE WESTERN STATES. PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. AS WE SEE WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE CLEAN WATER CLEAN AIR AND DANGEROUS SPECIES OFFER ALL OIL DRILLING. ATTEMPTS TO DISMANTLE FEDERAL LAWS AND STANDARDS BUT CALIFORNIAN THE CHALLENGING POSITION OF HAVING TO SECURE PROTECTION FOR OUR RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT. AB FOR FIFTY FOUR WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT BIRDS WHILE PROVIDING CERTAINTY FOR INDUSTRIES WITHOUT STARVING ECONOMIC GROWTH OR RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS AVOIDING THE CONFLICTS AND LITIGATION THAT SURROUND. EARLY IN THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT TODAY. BY TERRY BIRDS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA LAW IN OUR COURTS AND IMPORTANT NATURAL RESOURCE TO INTRINSIC VALUE FOR THE STATE BUT ALSO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC RECREATIONAL BENEFITS. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES MANY MIGRATORY BIRD POPULATIONS OF DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE HISTORIC NUMBERS AND THE STATE MUST BE ABLE TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE. AND PROTECT PROTECT THEM TO ENSURE THEIR NUMBERS NOT% NEEDLESSLY DECLINED FURTHER. ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR FIFTY FOUR OF FOUR SIMPLY MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA THAT CALIFORNIA RETAINS AUTHORITY TO MAKE ITS OWN RULES REGARDING MIGRATORY BIRD PROTECTIONS. OF ALL IT WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO MANAGE THIS CONSTITUTIONAL PUBLIC TRUST AS POSSIBILITY TO PROTECT PALMER WILDLIFE IN BATTLE HABITATS AND WILL NOT UNNECESSARILY TO FOR THEM TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT WITH ME AS ONE MARRANO ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF POLICY THE ITEM ON CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUALIFY ME DONE WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA -- AS YOU ALL KNOW I'VE IS A BIRD CONSERVATION OR ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROTECTING. MIGRATORY BIRDS AND JUST BIRDS IN GENERAL -- ALL OVER THE COUNTRY -- AUDUBON UNDERSTAND THAT MIGRATORY BIRD PROTECTIONS MUST BE APPLIED IN A WAY THAT BALANCES THE NEED OF SOCIETY INCLUDING ECONOMIC DRIVERS. AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- TO WE HAVE LONG WORKED WITH OUR CULTURE THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPERS -- AND TO THAT END WE KNOW THAT WE WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE WORKING -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SENSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO ANY ISSUES THAT WE ARE COME ACROSS. WE ARE SPONSORING BABY FOR FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE IT WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS. AS IT HAS DONE FOR DECADES THE BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO CREATE ANY NEW LEGAL. LIABILITIES AND IT WILL NOT STAY ME RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. IT IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE FEDERAL ROLL BACKS IN IT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS DO NOT UNDERMINE THE STATE LAW AND ITS AUTHORITY. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MIGRATORY BIRDS IN CALIFORNIA ARE INSIGNIFICANT DECLINE DUE TO HABITAT LOSS DISTURBANCE OR DIRECT TAKE OR KILLING FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES BIRDS PROVIDE. SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC RECREATIONAL AND ECONOMIC ECOLOGICAL VALUE IN THE FOR THIS IS FOR THE STATE. WE CAN'T WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WE CAN BIRD PROTECTION IN THE FACE OF THE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER CHALLENGES. THAT BIRDS IN THE STATE FACE INSTEAD WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFIT OF FUTURE GENERATIONS -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. STATED A BEFORE FIFTY FOUR IS. SEEKS TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO AT HAS YES IT HAS BEEN FOR DECADES IN THE STATE -- BY MERELY INSURING THE CALIFORNIA DECIDES FOR ITSELF HOW TO PROTECT MIGRATORY BIRDS WITHIN ITS BORDERS.

ANA TOMLINSON PROJECT PEYOTE IN CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR WILDLIFE REHABILITATED IN SUPPORT VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH. A SENIOR CITIZENS FOR DOING IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] BUT MYSTERY. WARNING WARNING. IS RESTORING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BY READ. WITH READ GOVERNMENT LESSONS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CENTER VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION. THREE PRINCIPAL CONCERNS ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE BILL -- FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE'S PENDING LITIGATION ON THIS ISSUE AND TYPICALLY POLICY COMMITTEES IN THIS HOUSE AND AND OTHER HOUSES. TEND NOT TO TAKE UP LEGISLATION WHEN PENDING LITIGATION IS UNDER WAY -- IF CALIFORNIAN THE OTHER SIX STATES SUCCEED I THAT LITIGATION. IN THIS ISSUE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CALIFORNIA GOES AWAY. SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO HOLD THE BILL -- UNTIL THAT LITIGATION RUNS ITS COURSE -- THE SECOND IS THAT. EVEN UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION INCIDENTAL TAKE A STILL A VIOLATION UNDER STATE LAW. SO IT'S UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION IS. ONLY THE FOR THE FINAL IN THE IN THE MOST CONCERNING FOR THE ASSOCIATION MEMBERS IS. THAT. THE MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT AS A STRICT LIABILITY STATUTE. NO INTENT NOTHING IF YOU KILL A BIRD. DESTROYED AND ASKED BREAK AN EGG. YOU VIOLATED THAT STATUTE THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A RATHER NEBULOUS STANDARD OF INCONSISTENCY. IF IF IF. FEDERAL LAW ARE THERE SOME INCONSISTENCY WITH STATE LAW THEN THAT WOULDCREATE AN ISSUE AND THEN AS TO WHO TO TERMS INCONSISTENCIES AND CONSISTENCY. THE BILL IS SILENT ONE WOULD ASSUME IT WOULD BE SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. BUT WE DEAL WITH -- MULTIPLE DISTRICTS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THEY'RE NOT ALL CONSISTENT WITH THEIR APPLICATION OF THE LAW OR WITH THEIR WORK IN THE FIELD -- FINALLY THIS MIGRATORY BIRD TREATY ACT. EVEN WITHOUT THIS BILL CREATES VERY. WRONG CONCERNS. FOR STATE EMPLOYEES M. EMPLOYEES OF LEVY MAINTAINING AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE. UNDER A FEDERAL ASSURANCE AGREEMENT THE CALIFORNIA ENTERED INTO AND AN ASSURANCE AGREEMENT THAT THE LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES FOR LEVEES ENTERED INTO AT THE STATE. WERE COMPELLED TO OPERATE MAINTAIN LEVEES AND FACILITIES OF THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL PURSUANT TO THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEER MANUALS. SO WE'RE OUT THERE MOWING LEVEES TAKING DOWN TREES BRUSH AND WHAT HAVE YOU. IN DOING THAT IN COMPLYING WITH THOSE ASSURANCE AGREEMENTS. AN EMPLOYEE BREAKS IN A DESTROYS ANNOUNCED -- INADVERTENTLY YOU KNOW TAKES A BIRD. THEN UNDER THE STRICT LIABILITY STATUTE. THEY ARE SYSTEM THEY COULD BE FACED WITH A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE AND UP TO SIX MONTHS IN JAIL. SO WE'RE PUTTING IN OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES IN OUR LOCAL AGENCY EMPLOYEES AT RISK. WITH -- WITH BILLS LIKE THIS AND SO WE WOULD REQUEST -- THAT THE BILL BE HELD. THANK YOU SO MUCH -- MEMBERS BRING BACK TO THE DAYS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND AS SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED. SURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HELLO BUT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS ESSENTIALLY -- AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE BAR OR WITNESSES WHAT'S BEEN STATUS QUO OF THIS TREATY IS BEEN WE'VE BEEN SIGNATORIES TO OVER A HUNDRED YEARS UNTIL THE ADMINISTRATION. PUT US OUT OF IT -- OUR INDUSTRIES -- HAVE DONE JUST FINE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES UNDER BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS THAT HAVE SUPPORTED. THIS TREATY. AND ESSENTIALLY THIS -- BILL -- WOULD ACTUALLY. CREATE EXPECTATIONS THAT INDUSTRY CAN RELY ON AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE SO MANY INDUSTRIES PULL OFF OPPOSITION AND ALL IT WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT. OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO ACTUALLY SET THOSE GUIDELINES AND EXPECTATIONS OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES -- AND SO IT BECOMES INSULTING. THIS THIS TREATY AND THIS PARTICULAR THIS PARTICULAR BILL IN CONFORMANCE WHAT THE TREATY HAS DONE OVER MANY DECADES DOESN'T SAY THAT ABOVE. A BIRD COULD NOT BE TAKING COULD NOT BE KILLED YET THESE BASSMASTER PRACTICES AND SO -- THERE'S REALLY NOTHING -- THAT WILL PREVENT -- THE FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION AND ITS MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHIN OPERATED FOR MANY MANY DECADES. THERE'S NO REAL TO THERE'S NO RISK OF INCREASED LIABILITY AT ALL VERY GOOD. YOU FOR THAT -- AND IT SEEMS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT MAY SEEM SELF EVIDENT -- IN TERMS OF THE FISHING GAME -- CODE AND AND SORT OF ENFORCEMENT THERE DIDN'T SOUND LIKE THERE'S ANY VERSION. TO THAT CLARIFICATION SO THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE A A SOLVABLE ISSUE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE RAN PENDING LITIGATION. I MEAN THAT THE LITIGATION IS ABOUT -- AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION ESSENTIALLY FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF MIGRATORY. BIRD TREATY ACT AND THE FACT IS. I'M. YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF WHAT DISCRETION NAY ONE EXERCISE I THINK IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF THE STATE TO DO ITS OWN PART HERE AND LOOK AFTER OURSELVES -- AND NOT BE SUBSERVIENT HERE I'D TO SOME OUTCOMES SO. I'M I'M NOT PARTICULARLY COMPELLED BY THAT POINT GIVEN THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND OURSELVES IN WHEN IT COMES THE STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW IN THE STATE OF SCIENCE IN WASHINGTON DC SO -- BUT I I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK THERE IN THE CLARIFICATION ON THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE -- MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR A MOVIE YES CENTER. I I JUST WOULD LIKE -- TO COMMENT THAT I I'M NOT GOING TO BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY NOT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD. SAVE MIGRATORY BIRDS IT DEFINITELY AT A REAL ISSUE -- I HAVE ONE OF THE LAST REMAINING. WETLANDS AREA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE ONLY REASON IT WORKS IS BECAUSE THERE'S FEDERAL LAND THEIR STATE LAND AND THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE LAND IN. AS PART OF THE CAN AT A CONSERVANCY AND AND AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PART OF THAT CONSERVANCY ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT I NEED TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER -- THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD ASSOCIATION -- THEY ARE. OBVIOUSLY IMPACTED BY THE DECISION THAT WE MAKE HERE TODAY AND BY THE END IMPACT ON THIS BILL AND I WENT UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER. WHAT KIND OF AMENDMENTS THEY ARE SUGGESTING IF AT ALL -- BEFORE I WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR SO IT IT I MAY GET THERE BUT I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT FOR TODAY -- MY I JUST DIE. GIVEN GIVEN HOW MUCH TERRITORY HAVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO AROUND THE LEVY SOMEONE ANDERSON AND A LITTLE BIT BETTER. YOU SAID EARLIER -- I'D BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- SO THAT'S A MOTIONS SENATOR ALLEN LIGHT A CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. THE THE FIVE FOUR CONTROLS ASIAN AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY FOR DECADES -- UNDER THE RULES OF THE CARE AND WILL ACTUALLY CREATE EXPECTATIONS THERE'S A SENSOR DATA GENERATE TWENTIETH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE THAT MAY BE ABLE TO MEANT TO BE AMENDED TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT SOME POINT DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PRESENT. THE BEST TIME ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO WELCOME BACK -- WE ARE ON ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN AB. SEVEN NINETEEN AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO PRESENT WERE READY WHEN YOU ARE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. SEVEN NINETEEN WHICH SEEKS TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE IMPORTANT. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION COMMERCIAL AND MEDICAL RESEARCH PURPOSES. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE SALE OF THEM IMPORTATION OF GOODS MADE OF ALLIGATOR AND A CROCODILE PARTS WOULD BE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY BANNED IN CALIFORNIA AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. THIS BAND IF ALLOWED WOULD BE ENACTED I'M SORRY FOR ALLOWED TO BE ENACTED WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THE A WETLANDS AND HABITAT CONSERVATION. AND I'M GROUNDBREAKING MEDICAL RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS THIS. IT IS THAT RESEARCH THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW. AS A MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE WHICH APPROVED THIS BILL IN APRIL I WAS VERY INTERESTED TO LEARN ABOUT SOME OF THE AMAZING MEDICAL SCIENCE RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED USING VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF ALLIGATORS. IT TURNS OUT THAT ALLIGATORS HAVING EVOLVED AND SURVIVED OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS HAVE A VARIETY OF CHARACTERISTICS AND QUALITIES WHICH ARE SHEDDING LIGHT. AND HELPING RESEARCH INTO MANY HUMAN CONDITIONS MUCH OF THIS RESEARCH IS BEING DONE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES. ALLIGATORS HAVE A NATURAL DEFENSE AGAINST MANY INFECTIOUS DISEASES THAT PLAGUE HUMAN SUCH AS HIV AND GONORRHEA. RESEARCHERS AT UC IRVINE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING RESEARCH IN THE ANTI. PROPERTIES OF ALLIGATOR BLOOD. IN ADDITION THE CANCER RESEARCH HAS GONE PER IT'S REALLY PERSONAL TO ME. I HAVE RECENTLY LOST A CLOSE FRIEND AND MENTOR TO CANCER AND IF THERE IS A POTENTIAL TO MAKE PROGRESS ON CANCER RESEARCH WE MUST ENSURE THAT THIS IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. FOR WHATEVER REASON IT APPEARS THAT SELLS AN ALLIGATOR BLOOD ARE COMPLETELY RESISTANCE TO CANCER. STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS ON TERM OR DIP TUMOR DIRECTED IMMUNOTHERAPY DRUGS USING ALLIGATORS. I BOTH CSU SAN MARCOS AND CSU -- SAMPLER DINO RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED. IN TWO CARDIOVASCULAR CARDIOVASCULAR AND PULMONARY QUALITIES FOUND IN ALLIGATORS WHICH MAY HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM STROKES. USC IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONDUCTING DENTISTRY RESEARCH INTO ALLIGATOR CAPACITY TO DO REGENERATE TEETH WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING THAT QUALITY IN HUMANS. THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF THIS TYPE OF GROUND BREAKING MEDICAL RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED USING ALLIGATOR BLOOD. TEETH BODY PARTS AS WELL AS WHOLE ALLIGATORS. SO HOW DOES THIS BILL HELP WITH THE RESEARCH. IN TWO WAYS FIRST. IF THE CURRENT LAW BANGLES INTO EFFECT. ON JANUARY FIRST ALLIGATOR BLOOD SERUM TEETH THE BODY PARTS EXCEPT -- A WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE SOLD OR DONATED TO UNIVERSITIES FOR THOSE CONDUCTING RESEARCH USING ALLIGATOR EGGS OR YEAR EARNINGS. BUT COST OF THESE RESEARCH. THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT EXPENSE HE EXPENSIVE LUXURY GOODS MADE FROM ALLIGATOR CROCODILE HIDES PRODUCTS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE NON ESSENTIAL LUXURY GOODS. I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS BUT I DO CARE ABOUT THE AMAZING MEDICAL RESEARCH THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED AND THE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL SO WE DO NOT ELIMINATE OR INCREASE THE COST OF THAT RESEARCH. TWO OTHER QUICK POINTS WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD BY BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MANUFACTURES OF SMALL LEATHER GOODS HERE CALIFORNIA THAT USE THESE LEGITIMATE HEIGHTS FOR THEIR BUSINESSES AND HELP WORKING PEOPLE PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. ALSO OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN SALES. AND USE TAX REVENUES FROM THE SALES OF THOSE PRODUCTS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO REPLACE THE REVENUE OF THE SALES OF PRODUCTS ARE BANNED? THIS BILL WOULD EXTEND THE CURRENT LAW SUNSET BY FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS AND REQUIRED THAT THOSE CONSUMER PRODUCTS BE ACCOMPANIED BY A CONSUMER DISCLOSURE. NOW I WOULD LIKE TO PASS THE BATON OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL WETLANDS IMPACT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. FOR SOME RUBIO THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN CENTERS. SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ALONGSIDE MY COLLEAGUE TODAY ON A. B. SEVEN NINETEEN AS MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR SENATOR CAFIERO AND I SHARE DISTRICT. THAT IS HOME. TO SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRODUCTIVE WETLANDS. THE GRASSLANDS ECOLOGICALLY AREA WHICH INCLUDES OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF WETLAND HABITAT AND IS HOME. TO AND SUPPORTS OVER TWO MILLION -- WATER FELL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SHORE BIRDS. 50% OF WHICH USE THE PACIFICFLYWAY JR MIGRATION SO WHERE IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S -- ENVIRONMENT HABITAT AND AND SUSTAINING THAT -- HERE WE SEE EVERY DAY BACK ON THE REAL WORLD IMPACT OF THIS PRESERVATION. AND ONE THING THAT'S OFTENTIMES LOST INFOSYS'S WETLANDS ALSO SERVED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CAPTION CARBON. AS WE ALL STRUGGLE. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES CLIMATE CHANGE. UNIVERSITY SCIENCE FOUNDATIONS OUR OWN. CALIFORNIA HAS FOUND THAT PROPERLY RESTORED MAINTAIN WETLANDS CAN ACTUALLY SEQUESTER UP TO FOUR TIMES THE CARBON PER ACRE THAN FOREST SO THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT. CONTRIBUTION MEMBERS NOT ONE TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. SO WHAT IS AB SEVEN NINETEEN HAVE TO DO WITH WETLANDS IS OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE ALLIGATORS MERCED COUNTY -- ALLIGATORS NATURAL HABITAT IS WETLANDS AND COASTAL MARSHES IN THE SOUTH. EASTERN UNITED STATES IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH ALLIGATORS ARE PLACED ON THE ENDANGERED. SPECIES LIST TO GO DWINDLING POPULATION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALONG WITH STATE FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT -- AS WELL AS ALLIGATOR FARMS JOINED TOGETHER TO FORGE EFFORTS TO RESTORE THE WETLANDS THIS SERVICE NATURAL HABITAT. FOR ALLIGATORS. THESE EFFORTS ARE FUNDED SIGNIFICANT BY FARMERS WHO PURCHASE ALLIGATOR EGGS FROM WELL IN ORDER FOR FARMING PURPOSES. ALLIGATORS ARE ONLY FOUND IN NATURAL WETLANDS WHICH WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT FARMERS CONSERVATION MINDED ORGANIZATIONS STATE AND FEDERAL WILDLIFE AGENCIES WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO RESTORE THOSE WETLANDS AS A SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY DO -- BACK HOME IN MY DISTRICT. IN LOUISIANA ALONE THE REVENUE FROM HARVESTING AND REPLENISHING OF THE SPECIES EXCEEDS ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. THESE REVENUE SERVICE MATCHING FUNDS. WHICH THE WETLANDS CARETAKERS USED TO OBTAIN FEDERAL WETLAND CONSERVATION FUNDING. CALIFORNIA YOU LET US IS THE SAME CONSERVATION FUNDING FOR ITS WETLAND RESTORATION ACTIVITIES. IF THE SALE OF THESE PRODUCTS HAS BEEN IN CALIFORNIA IS ESTIMATED TO FARMERS WILL EXPERIENCE A 25% REDUCTION IN THESE REVENUES. OBVIOUSLY IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT CALIFORNIA'S A MASSIVE MARKET AND CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS ON THIS -- ECONOMIC. SITUATION. BLUNTLY STATED OUR ACTIONS THEY MEMBERS WILL IMPACT THE RESTORATION AND MAINTENANCE OF WETLANDS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF THESE WEAPONS IN THE SOUTHEAST MOST OF WHICH ARE THE NATURAL HABITAT OF ALLIGATORS AND OVER SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED OTHER SPECIES. OF FLORA AND FAUNA. LATEST POPULATION SURVEYS INDICATE THAT THERE ARE NEARLY FIVE MILLION ALLIGATORS LIVING IN WILD IN THOSE WETLANDS I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. THERE ARE ONLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ALLIGATORS LIVING THE SAME WETLANDS WHEN THEY WERE LISTED ON THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST SO MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE. THIS IS TRULY A SUCCESS STORIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE PRE EMINENT EXAMPLE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE ENDANGERED SPECIES PROGRAM. FINALLY I'LL POINT OUT THAT THE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF WETLANDS STORE MILLIONS OF TONS OF CARBON KEEPING THAT CARBON FROM ENTERING OUR ATMOSPHERE THAT CARBON SEQUESTRATION IS POSSIBLE ONLY WITH THE PREMIER MAINTENANCE OF THOSE WETLANDS MADE POSSIBLE. BY THE REVENUES WERE DISCUSSING TODAY. IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE ALLIGATORS IN THE OTHER SEVENTY SEVEN HER FLORA FAUNA SPECIES THAT THRIVE AND SURVIVE IN THE WETLANDS. IF YOU CARE ABOUT CARBON SEQUESTRATION I WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS LIKE TO REHAB SEVERAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MEMBERS. THANK YOU -- WHEN ISN'T SUPPORT PLEASE MINUTES EACH? THANK YOU CHAIR. AND SENATORS. FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I'M CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR DUCKS UNLIMITED. AND FORMALLY FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS I WORKED IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. YEAH WITH THE FLORIDA FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION COMMISSION AND SERVED AS THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR EIGHT YEARS. WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ISSUE. NOW IT DUCKS UNLIMITED WE'RE DEDICATED TO CONSERVATION AMERICA'S WETLANDS. FOR THE BENEFIT OF WATER FOUND NUMEROUS SPECIES OF FISH WILDLIFE AND PEOPLE. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOU'RE WEIGHING. THE FUTURE OF A PROGRAM THAT HAS MADE GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS. TO WETLANDS PROTECTION ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. AND THIS IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHEN WETLANDS ECOSYSTEMS CONTINUE TO BE IN GREAT PERIL. THE VERY EXISTENCE AND FUNCTION OF WETLANDS ECOSYSTEMS AND MUCH MUCH OF IT IN PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. LEANS ON THE ECONOMIC VALUES THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE USE OF THESE LANDS AND LANDSCAPES. UNFORTUNATELY THE ECONOMIC FACTORS. HAVE DRIVEN AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE WETLAND CONVERSION AND LOSS. CALIFORNIA HOWEVER IS RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND CONSERVATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND FOR SERVING AS A POSITIVE AND POWERFUL INFLUENCE FOR PROACTIVE CONSERVATION ACROSS THE NATION. NOW THIS MAY COME AS A SURPRISE TO SOME BUT I'D ARGUE THAT. CALIFORNIA ALLOWING THE SALE OF SUSTAINABLE ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS YOU'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT LEADERSHIP AND YOU'VE HAD GREAT INFLUENCE IN PROTECTING WETLANDS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST TODAY. YES THE FUNDING THAT FLOWS FROM THE SALE OF SUSTAINABLE ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS. HAS GREAT BEARING ON PROTECTION AND PRESERVING FUNCTIONAL WETLANDS ALLIGATOR HABITAT. AND HEALTHY POPULATIONS OF ALLIGATORS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST SO YOU MAY BE ASKING HOW DOES THIS WORK HOW DOES A CELL OF ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA CONNECT BACK TO WETLANDS IN SOUTHEASTERN STATES. BACK IN THE LATE EIGHTIES AS THESE PROGRAMS ARE BEING DEVELOPED I WAS ACTUALLY INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF FLORIDA'S ALLIGATOR PROGRAM WE WORK WITH THE TEAM A CONSERVATION BIOLOGIST PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO DESIGN A PROGRAM. THAT DELIVER THE ECONOMIC VALUE FROM THOSE PRODUCTS BACK TO THE LANDOWNER BACK TO THE LANDSCAPE. BACK TO INCENTIVES FOR PROTECTING THOSE WETLANDS. NOW LOOKING BACK OVER THIRTY YEARS THIRTY PLUS YEARS. AFTER THESE PROGRAMS OF AN IMPLEMENTED AND BEEN IN PLACE AND BIN MONITOR SCIENTIFICALLY WE CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY THEY'RE WORKING. THEY'VE SERVED PROTECT WETLANDS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST. THEY'VE SERVE TO BOOST ALLIGATOR POPULATIONS NOT JUST THE STAIN WE'VE GONE BEYOND SUSTAINABILITY WITH A PROGRAM THAT ACTUALLY BOOST. AND ENHANCES ALLIGATOR POPULATIONS AND THEREFORE BENEFITS ALL THE SPECIES OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANY. THAT ARE THREATENED AND ENDANGERED THE MIGRATORY BIRDS YOU'VE BEEN TALKINGABOUT. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY A BENEFIT FOR ALL OF THOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE WATERMAN SENATORS THANK YOU ALL OF ROCK OR A CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES SOCIAIS SHOULD WE HAVE THE IMMENSE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING -- ROUGHLY A THOUSAND COMPANIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RANGING FROM -- BY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE STARTUP COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING. SOME OF THE VERY GROUND BREAKING MEDICAL RESEARCH THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO ALLUDED -- TO THAT RESEARCH IS BEING CONDUCTED INTO INFECTIOUS DISEASES HIV CANCER CHRONIC DISEASES CYSTIC FIBROSIS ACHE -- FIBROSIS UE ME AND ANTI MICROBIAL RESEARCH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. SINCE THE ALLIGATOR WAS REMOVED FROM THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE ROUGHLY THIRTY YEARS OF OF RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS WITHOUT SOME INCREDIBLE ADVANCEMENTS -- IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF NOT ONLY HUMAN ANATOMY BUT ANIMAL ANATOMY. WE REPRESENT COMPANIES THAT MAKE VACCINES FOR THESE ANIMALS TO PROTECT THEM FROM WEST NILE VIRUS THAT IN TURN PROTECT THE ECOSYSTEMS IN WHICH THEY LIVE. HI THRE ARE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR ABILITY TO KEEP DOING -- GROUND BREAKING RESEARCH INTO DISEASES SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER NEWER DEGENERATIVE DISEASES -- SO WITH THAT NUMBER ANY OTHER TIME WE WOULD SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL -- AND DRIVERS THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. HE'S COMING FORWARD. NAME AN AFFILIATION. MR MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY OUR PARTNERS A DUCKS UNLIMITED. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

CATHERINE BRANDENBURG REPRESENTING OUR PROTECTING ENVIRONMENTS ANIMALS COMMUNITIES AND HABITATS FOR THE LANDOWNERS AND FARMERS AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OKAY VERY GOOD THANKS SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON ERIN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF HEARING OR ENGLAND AND STRONG SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE -- THOSE IN OPPOSITION YOU HAVE TO WITNESSES AND THEN OTHERS. OTHER OPPONENTS CAN. COME FORWARD AFTER THAT THANK YOU ARE WE MAY BRING YOU BACK TO SO THANK YOU GUYS [inaudible] MORNING WELCOME. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE URGING YOUR NO VOTE. ON THIS BILL I'M A LITTLE HISTORY ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY PENAL CODE SIX FIFTY THREE OH WAS INTENDED TO KEEP CALIFORNIANS FROM CONTRIBUTING TO THE ILLEGAL TAKE OF ENDANGERED WILD ANIMALS ACROSS THE GLOBE. THERE ARE TWENTY SIX SPECIES OF ALLIGATORS CROCODILES CAME IN SYNC AERIALS LISTED IN PROTECTED UNDER THE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED SPECIES SPECIES OR EXCITING. AB SEVEN NINETEEN LIKE EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH STALLED IN THE ASSEMBLY EARLIER THIS YEAR UNDERMINES THE GOALS OF PENAL CODE SIX FIFTY THREE OO. WELL RECOVERY OF THE AMERICAN ALLIGATOR AS WE'VE LEARNED AS A SUCCESS STORY DUE TO THE EFFORTS OF MANY AND THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED BY THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. WILD ALLIGATORS **** AND CROCODILES AND CAME IS THE LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE FARING SO WELL. THOSE ANIMALS FACE SIGNIFICANT THREATS FROM HABITAT LOSS ANY LEGAL KILLING TO FUEL MARKET DEMAND FOR SKINS AND PRODUCTS MADE FROM THEIR SKINS. IN AN ANALYSIS OF WILDLIFE SHIPMENTS FROM LATIN AMERICA SEIZING UNITED STATES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE UNCOVERED A WHILE THE TRAFFIC IN CRISIS. AND URGENT NEED TO STEP UP EFFORTS TO STOP THE PERNICIOUS TRADE AND IMPERILED SPECIES. CAME IN AND CROCODILE SKINS WERE TWO OF THE FIVE MOST ILLEGALLY TRADED ANIMALS THE PRESSURE ON THEIR SERVER THE PRESSURE ON THEIR SURVIVAL IN THE WILD DRIVEN BY COMMERCIAL DEMAND FOR THEIR PARTS IS SIGNIFICANT. AND THE FACT THAT THEY EXIST IN HIGH NUMBERS IN FARMS OR IN THE WILD IN ONE OR TWO STATES THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE FACT THAT THESE ANIMALS ARE BEING DRIVEN TO EXTINCTION OUTSIDE OF THE U. S.. CONSUMERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICALS CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTS MADE FROM LEGALLY FARM ANIMALS VERSES ILLEGALLY WHILE CUT ANIMALS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN US SPECIAL WILDLIFE SERVICE RULING NOTED THAT SMALL PARTS AND PRODUCTS OF CROCODILIAN LETTER ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WHEN MATED TO GOODS. THAT'S HAMPERING THE IDENTIFICATION OF LEGAL ALLIGATOR PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF ENDANGERED OR THREATENED POCKET ALIENS. PROBLEMS OF THE DEDICATION COULD INCREASE ILLEGAL TRADE IN ENDANGERED CROCODILIAN PRODUCTS. PAST LEGISLATIVE ANALYSES OF PRIOR EXTENSIONS OF THE STRAIGHT ALLOWANCE NOTED ONGOING CONCERNS REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF SOCIETIES AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND ACTING AB SEVEN ONE NINE WOULD WRONGLY SIGNAL THAT SUCH CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED WHEN IN FACT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED A ALL. THE AMENDMENT MADE HASTILY IN THE THE ASSEMBLY WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE IS FRANKLY MEANINGLESS ALL THAT AMENDMENT DOES REQUIRE THAT ALL ALLIGATOR CROCODILE PARTS BROUGHT INTO CALIFORNIA -- LABEL TO SAY THEIR SITE IS COMPLIANT WITHOUT ANY WAY TO CONFIRM THE RIVER AT CITY OF THAT CLEAN. EVEN THOUGH IT THIS INDUSTRY HAS KNOWN FROM ITS INCEPTION THAT IT WAS ENGAGING IN COMMERCIAL TRADE OF PARTS FROM ANIMALS FACING GLOBAL ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING RISKS AND HAS KNOWN FOR FOUR YEARS THAT IS MOST RECENT EXPANSION WAS GOING TO EXPIRE IN CALIFORNIA ON JANUARY ONE OF NEXT YEAR. AND HAS KNOWN THAT WILDLIFE PROTECTION ORGANIZATION HAVE RAISED ALARMS THAT THE MARKETING OF ALLIGATOR CROCODILE PRODUCTS WAS FEELING THE ONGOING EXTINCTION OF SPECIES OUTSIDE THE U. S.. THE INDUSTRY HAS FAILED TO EVEN TRY TO SET UP A CREDIBLE VERIFIABLE SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY THIS INDUSTRY WANTS THE LEGISLATURE TO GIVE THEM A FOURTH EXEMPTION FROM CALIFORNIA'S ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING POLICY WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING MEANINGFUL IN A STATE WHERE CRACKING DOWN ON WHILE THEY TRAFFICKING HAS BECOME A LAW ENFORCEMENT. PRIORITY THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY NO THANK YOU. AS YOU KEEP IT RELATIVELY SURE WE LET HER GO OVER A LITTLE BIT SORRY THING I TO WRITE A PARAPHRASE IF YOU CAN'T. NICHOLAS I GET SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION I JUST WANT TO SAY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I DID COMPLETE MY MASTERS IN STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BY IS IN SPAIN. ONE THING YOU ALMOST NO IS THAT SOCIETIES HAS NO ANIMAL WELFARE OR ANIMAL. PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS YOU CAN KILL AND SLAUGHTER AN ANIMAL ANYWAY YOU WANT UNDER SITE IS AND BE STUDIES COMPLIANT WE HAVE ACCESS TO INVESTIGATIONS OF ALLIGATOR CROCODILE FARM INVESTIGATIONS INTO BY WAY. YET NAM AND IN TEXAS. WE HAD. IN ALL OF THE SKINS FROM THOSE FACILITIES WENT TO LOUISVUITTON AN ERROR MAYES. EACH FACILITY CONFINED ANIMALS IN GRAND BEREN AND TOTALLY UNNATURAL CONDITIONS IN VIETNAM MANY COCKTAILS LANGUISHED IN CELL SMALLER THAN THE LENGTH OF THEIR BODIES. THE OPERATION IN TEXAS KEPT ALLIGATORS IN DARK WAREHOUSES IN PIZZA PUTRID WATER WITH A RISK THAT REEKED OF RANCID EXCREMENT. OUT WORKERS WERE THERE -- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SHOOT THE ALLIGATORS IN THE SKULL WITH  CAPTIVE BALL GUN TO RENDER ANIMALS IN SENSIBLE BEFORE SIGN INTO THEM WITH BOX CUTTERS. BUT DURING OVER FIVE HUNDRED SLAUGHTERS THIS IS NOT DONE ONE TIME. THEY CUT THE ALLIGATORS NECKS AND SHOVED A ROD UP THEIR SPINAL CORD COLUMNS IN ATTEMPTS TO PIT OR SCRAMBLE THEIR BRAINS. THE MANAGER HIMSELF STABBED FOR CONSCIOUS ALLIGATORS WITH A KNIFE TO DISLOCATE THEIR CERVICAL VERTEBRAE AS A SUFFERING ANIMALS FLAILED AND STRUGGLE. IN VIETNAM WORKERS ELECTRO SHOCK CROCODILES IN ORDER TO IMMOBILIZE THEM HACK INTO THEIR NECKS IN RAMROD'S DOWN THEIR SPINES NOT EVEN ATTEMPTING TO DESTROY THEIR BRAINS FIRST. A WE KNOW THAT ALLIGATORS HAVE A VERY SLOW METABOLISM AND THEY DIE VERY SLOWLY THIS IS. INCREDIBLY PAINFUL THE WAY THEY ARE SLAUGHTERED -- WE KNOW THAT THEY SUFFER IMMENSELY IN THESE CONDITIONS WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT FURRY AND CUDDLY LIKE. THE ANIMALS THAT WE ARE PROTECTING IN AB. FORTY FOUR BUT THEY FEEL PAIN ALL THE SAME THING WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK TO OPPOSE THIS THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD IF WE COULD JUST TO NAME. AND AFFILIATION.

HAVE CAN BRING BACK TO THE DíAS FROM FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- CENTER AROUND. OKAY WELL I'VE GOT -- SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL I THINK -- ALONG TH LINES OF WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND AND I'M AND BASICALLY ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH I THINK DOES A GOOD JOB [inaudible] OF RAISING A NUMBER OF THE CONCERNS RELATING TO SOURCING AND TRACKING. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE ETHICAL IN WELFARE CENTERS THAT HAVE BEEN. BROUGHT UP AS WELL I THINK IN THE END OF THE DAY. THE CONCERN OUT THERE IS THAT THIS WAS PASSED BACK IN THE SEVENTIES BECAUSE THERE WAS A FEAR. OPTICALLY RELATED TO THE ENDANGERED. SIDE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE DANGER STATUS HAS BEEN REMOVED -- WITH REGARDS TO THE LOUISIANA BASED. ALLIGATORS BUT AT THE SAME TIME. ARE THERE IS A PRETTY ROBUST ILLEGAL TRADE -- FROM OTHER PLACES WHERE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE SAME KIND OF STANDARDS. AND AND YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PUSHED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO TAKE SUBSTANTIVE ACTION IN THIS AREA AND HAS FAILED TO DO SO. AND I THINK THEY JUST YOU KNOW RELIED ON BEING ABLE -- TO GET. YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW GET -- EXTENSIONS TO THE SUNSET OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I THINK YOU'RE MY FRUSTRATION IS HERE THEY ARE AGAIN AT THE LAST MINUTE -- THIS THING IS ABOUT TO SUNSET AGAIN -- YOU KNOW LITERALLY IT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND AND HERE WE ARE BEING ASKED -- JUST GIVE US A LITTLE MORE TIME AND MIKE MY WHOLE CONCERN IS WILL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE WE GONNA. WHAT DO YOU DO DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME? I'M. AND THAT'S I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHORS. TO START FIRST OF ALL CAN COME WE HAVE MY SUPPORTERS APPEARS SO THAT WE CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS FOR YOU THANK YOU SIR. I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A CRACK AT THAT TERM. FIRST OFF I WOULD SAY I'M NOT SURE. WHAT I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PERSPECTIVE THAT YOU'RE RAISING -- HOW DO WE USE THIS BILL? TO ADDRESS OR RESOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED B THE ABSENCE LEGITIMATE ISSUES WHERE WE'VE GOT. YOU KNOW IT INTERNATIONAL TRADE PROBLEMS AND BAD PRACTICES AND HOW CAN CALIFORNIA TAKE A STAND IN -- INSURING THAT WERE DEALING IN LEGAL PRODUCT THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE NOW I'M NOT SURE FROM WHAT I HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION -- THAT. ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS WILL REMOVE KIND OF THE PUREST POSITION -- EVERY THERE'S A SENIOR SOME OF THE FOLKS -- THAT IDEA WITH IRREGULAR SACRAMENTO WHO THINK EGGS ARE GROWING ON THE SHELVES OF WHOLE FOODS -- THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THESE ARE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS IN WHAT ONCE IS A NECESSARY INVESTMENTS NIKOLOC RESTORATION -- TO MAKE SURE I MEAN WE TRY DRAW YOUR TENSION I THINK PAGE -- THREE PAGE TWO AND THREE OF THE ANALYSIS YOUR NOSE TO PROPOSE A LOT LAYS OUT THE THREE ITEMS THAT THIS BILL. ACCOMPLISHES THIS OBVIOUS EXTENSIVE SUNSET TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT PROHIBITS ENDANGERED SPECIES THE IMPORTATION. OR SALE OF AND THAT REQUIRES THAT WE BEING CLOSE COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL -- AND LEGAL STANDARDS THOSE ARE THINGS I WOULD ASSUME WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT ON WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS HOW DO WE ENFORCE THAT. AND IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO IN THE BILL. TO STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT I THINK I'D BE A GREAT PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA A LEAD AND I WOULD BE -- CERTAINLY OPEN AND WOULD WELCOME. THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO HOW WE INSURE -- THE THIRD OF FORTUNE OCCURS AND WHAT -- BENCHMARKS WE COULD PUT THIS BILL TO ENCOURAGE THE ISSUE NOW YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE LAST MINUTE THIS THAT THE NEXT THING. OBVIOUSLY THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN THIS -- PROCESS AND SINCE I DON'T DO SPONSORED BILLS I DO ADAM GRAY BILLS. ARE BEFORE YOU WITH THAT ISSUE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND MAKING IT A BETTER BILL. YEAH I MEAN I GUESS SO IF YOU BUILD THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH IS ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE EIGHT I THINK GETS INTO THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF AN EFFECTIVE TRACKING SYSTEM -- SAFEGUARDS. YOU KNOW AS THE F. W. ET CETERA BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE DAY AYE AYE MY UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORY THIS IS THAT THIS COMES UP EVERY TIME THERE'S AN ATTEMPT -- TO TO TRY TO EXTEND THE SUNSET INDUSTRY SAYS ALL WE'RE WORKING ON WE'RE WORKING ON A AND THEN -- NO SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IS MADE AND AND THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING LOUISIANA AND THAT ALL MAY BE THE CASE YOU KNOW I I DON'T I CAN'T SPEAK TO PERSONALLY -- BUT I I I AND AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE ISSUE AND I THINK THERE'S A BUNCH OF ETHICS ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. I WOULD RATHER SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT AS WELL IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE WAY THESE ANIMALS ARE TREATED BUT BUT THIS BROADER QUESTION OF THE ILLEGAL TRADE AND WHAT WE CAN AND WHAT WE ARE WHAT WE ARE NOT DOING WITH REGARDS -- TO TRACKING YEAH IT SEEMS TO CONTINUE TO BE KICKED DOWN THE ROAD AND I IN AN ACT. I THOUGHT YOU KNOW MY MY MY MY SENSE IS THAT WE ARE NOT PASS SOMETHING IKE THIS. IF -- I A YOU GIVEN GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD IF IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD. REALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE LAID OUT HERE ON PAGE DO THE ANALYSIS. THAT'S MY MY COURT CONCERNING SENATOR -- YEAH PLEASE IF YOU WANNA RESPOND OR OTHER TIMES I THINK CENTER MONNING IS A COMMON AND CENTER HERTZBERG POTENTIAL AS WELL. BUT LET ME LET THE FEAR THE SENATORS REMARKED ON ANTS OKAY THAT'S GREAT LET'S DO THAT. IN A MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M A SAUNA FOCUS ON A MEDICAL APPLICATIONS SIDE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOCUSED ON IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THIS BILL PERTAINS ONLY -- TO DEAD ALLIGATORS IF YOU WILL NOT LIVING IN A LOT OF THE MEDICAL TESTING IS WITH LIVING ANIMALS IS THAT CORRECT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S A 100% ACCURATE WE ALSO IMPORT THE EGGS ON THE CAL STATE SENATOR DEAN OF GROUP IS WRITTEN GETTING READY TO GO DOWN. AND BRING THE EGGS DO YOU CONSIDER THEM LIVE OR DEAD. IT'S AN ALLIGATOR PARTS AND SOUL IT'S THE BAN ON ALLIGATOR PARTS ANY PART IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND SO THAT INCLUDES. DEAD OR ALIVE. THAT'S NOT MY UNDERSTANDING IS I'VE HAD THE BILL INTERPRETED TO ME BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THERE SUCH A DISTINCTION IN MY VIEW. BETWEEN. POTENTIAL MEDICAL APPLICATION. IN COMMERCIAL SALE -- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED. NEARING AND PROTECT MEDICAL APPLICATION. SO PART WE DID HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AND THE WAY THE WORK I'M CALLING IT -- THE ECONOMIC ECOSYSTEM IS THAT THE FUNDING FOR THE MARSHES AND IF WHERE'S THAT MIGHT THAT GUY -- CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE RESTAURANT. THAT'S WHAT HIS NAME IS THAT THE GUY -- BY THE SALE OF THOSE. FEDEX. THE REST RESTORATION OF THE MARSHES SO IT'S ALL CONNECTED IT'S NOT ONE OR THE OTHER IF YOU. ELIMINATE ONE THAN THE OTHER FUNDING DOESN'T HAPPEN AND SO IT'S KINDA IT'S ALL THE ECOSYSTEM IS CONNECTED. I I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR. YEAH -- THE IN YET MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME CLEARING JUST LOOKING AT THE CODE HERE JUST. IT'S CURRENT LAWS. DEAD BODY OR ANY PART OR PRODUCT THEREOF SO WHETHER THE THE PART THEREOF IS SENATOR AND HAS TO BE RELATED BACK TO THE DEAD BODY VERSES LIVE BIG RIGHT COULD YOU COMMENT ON A MISTER CHAIRMAN THERE'S TWO POINTS HERE YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ABOUT THE READ OF THE CURRENT STATUTE. THE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED NOT JUST WITH EGGS WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED OF A LIVING THING. ALSO ALLIGATORS LIVE ALLIGATORS BUT IT'S ALSO CONDUCTED WITH SERUM BLOOD. T. ANOTHER ALLIGATOR PARTS THAT COME FROM. THAT ALLOCATED BODY SO. THE RESEARCH BEING DONE USING THOSE PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE BECAUSE OF THE BAND. SECONDLY RELATIVE TO THE LIVE ALLIGATORS CENTER MONNING WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS. THE WAY THE ECO SYSTEM WORKS IS THAT THE WETLANDS WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF THE YEARLING ALLIGATORS THAT ARE IMPORTED FOR CAL STATE SAMBAR DINO WAR THE EGGS THAT ARE IMPORTED AT USC. IS SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL REVENUE THAT. EMANATES FROM THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IF THAT AN INITIAL REVENUE ISN'T THERE TO SUPPORT THE WETLANDS THE NESTING AREAS. THEN. ONE OF TWO THINGS HPPENS EITHER IN THOSE RESEARCH PARTS BECOME. MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. AND AND I CAN TESTIFY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL DOING OTHER MEDICAL RESEARCH WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY THE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MOUSE. TO DO. RESEARCH SECOND TELL YOU A BECOMES VERY EXPENSIVE VERY QUICKLY. SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET TO SUPPORT. THE EGGS AND THE LIVE ALLIGATORS THE FARMS THAT PROVIDE THE LIVE ALLIGATORS FOR THE WILD. THE COST OF THOSE BECOME. A MUCH HIGHER IF YOU'RE USING LIFE PRODUCTS BUT IF YOU'RE USING IN FACT. PARTS OF DEAD ALLIGATORS FOR THE RESEARCH THAN THAN THE BAN WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR IN WHAT PERCENT OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IS CALIFORNIA. SO MY UNDERSTANDING AND ESTIMATES DONE BY OTHER STATES IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF THE NATIONAL MARKET IS APPROXIMATELY 25% [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'VE GOT NO FURTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW THANKS. THANK SAID ARRIVAL WILL AYE AYE AYE AND SHE ADDS I THINK WAS IN SOME EMIGRES OPENING PRESENTATION ABOUT THE EXPECTED. ECONOMIC DECLINES IN THE MARKET I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE ENGAGING SO LET'S TOUCH ON THAT I'LL KICKING THE CENTER HERTZBERG THEN WE CAN TRY TO SORT OF CENTRALIZED SOME OF THESE ISSUES HERE SO. UNLESS. JUMP IN OKAY OUT I WOULD YOU TO PLEASE GO CENTERS FOR WANT TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WERE CENTER ALLEN. I THINK THAT THERE IS THIS ISSUE ABOUT TRACKING THAT IF IN FACT. IGGY WAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME THIS IS LIKE SALMON OR THERE'S ALL SORTS OF THINGS WHERE. WE HAVE LIVING -- ANIMALS THAT ARE. BUT IT'S COWS OR WHATEVER ELSE IT IS BUT THAT THE INCENTIVE VISION FOR IT IS IN A WAY FOR FOR THIS NOT TO HAPPEN THAT CONCEPTS TO CREATE SOME. I CAN -- CONSTRAIN TIMELINE TO DEAL WITH THIS TRACKING AND MAKE IT REALLY REAL TO ME. IS SOMETHING THAT IN ESSENCE BASICALLY SAYS THIS IS WHAT YOU REPRESENTED IN THE ART THE ARGUMENT IT WOULD BE. DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT LET'S JUST MAKE SURE WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS THAT HAPPENED THE TIME TO DO THAT SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT FLAW CIRCLE BACK WITH WITH SENATOR ALLEN TERMS OF THAT. OF OF HOW DO -- APPROPRIATELY -- FIGURE THAT OUT OKAY THANK YOU CENTERS BURKE -- WE ONLY A FEW MINUTES HERE LET BEFORE CAUCUS I DON'T WANT TO RUSH THE DISCUSSION BUT I DID WANT TO PINPOINT A FEW THE SETTLE ANY ISSUES OF CONTENTION SO. ONE IS ABOUT THE CONCERN AROUND MEDICAL RESEARCH IN THE DEPRESSION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS I'M LOOK I'M I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT ISSUE I LIKE YOU'VE LOST YOUR FRIENDS. TO CANCER. HAVE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS GOING TO ALZHEIMER'S WHICH WE WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIG DEAL SO TO THE FOLKS IN LIFE SCIENCES. I'D LOVE A FRAMEWORK FRANKLY WHERE WE DIDN'T. HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ENTIRE BROADER COMMERCIAL MARKET ISSUE AND DEAL DIRECTLY WITH HIS MEDICAL RESEARCH ISSUE. BUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE SUPPORTERS ARE SAYING WELL IF YOU START TO UNDERCUT. THE TRADE IN GENERAL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MARKET DEPRESSION. THE THE THE NOW SAYS. SAID ABOUT A BILLION ANNUALLY GLOBAL BASIS GIVE OR TAKE. NO NO NATIONAL MARKET MIGHT BE LESS BUT LET'S SAY 25% DROP OFF COMES FROM. THE THE BAND GOING INTO EFFECT -- SEE ABOUT A SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR TRADE MEAN [inaudible] I. D.. I'D BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE LOOKING AT IT AT THIS SORT OF RESEARCH DRIVEN APPROACH WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS A THE ABILITY FOR INSTITUTIONS KEEP DOING THIS RESEARCH. AND THEN. LOOK LOOK AT STUDY REPORT ON ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND SEE HOW THAT MIGHT DIRECTLY IMPACT -- THE THE INDUSTRY SO IF PRICES IN FOR INSTANCE MISTER LANG POINT I BECAME EGREGIOUS AND YOU'RE SEEING SOME MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPEDIMENT TO BEING ABLE TO GO TO THAT CANCER RESEARCH. AND WE COULD SORT OF TO A LOOK BACK AT IT. THE PROBLEM HERE IS AND YOU MAY YOU KNOW I I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IN GOOD FAITH. I I I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND AND FROM A WETLANDS PERSPECTIVE. TO BACK TO MY TAKE IS A IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S SLIGHTLY. DIFFERENT JUST BECAUSE IF WE SORT OF SAY YES AGAIN. AND THEN HOPE THE INDUSTRY COMES UP WITH. SOME ANSWERS. I KIND OF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE SORT OF BANKING ON THAT PROMISE I'M IF THERE WAS A PRESENTATION FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR INSTANCE OF A NEW RFID CHIPS SYSTEM OR SOME OTHER. SYSTEM THAT WAS ACTUALLY UP AND RUNNING TODAY TRACK AND TRACE READY -- I THINK WE MAY BE HAVING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION ON THE ON THAT SORT OF SPECIES DECLINE ISSUE THE PROBLEM IS NOW IF WE AUTHORIZES IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IT. WAS WE'RE SORT OF EVEN IF WE CONDITION DIDN'T SAID. IT CAME PROCEED BUT YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY SHALL COME UP WITH SOME TRACKING STANDARD WE'RE STILL SORT OF MAKING A FOR LOOKING PROMISE THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A GUARANTEE. WE CAN DEAL WITH. THE TORTURE BECAUSE IT IS TORTURE WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT IN PLACE LIKE VIETNAM AND I'VE EVEN HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT TEXAS -- ENDS. I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE AND ALSO OVER PRESUME WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT TEXAS LOUISIANA LET WEAPONS POLICY. BECAUSE THOSE STATE LEGISLATURES AND STATE GOVERNMENTS I THINK COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUT I'M SENSITIVE ALSO THESE CARBON SSUES THAT ARE RAISED HIM AND AGAIN. IF WE CAN SORT OF DO THAT FOR LOOKING ANALYSIS AND SAY OKAY IF WE REALLY START TO COLLAPSE FOR INSTANCE A WEAPONS PROGRAM FOR RESEARCH PROGRAM LET'S TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT IT -- AFTER THIS THIS BAN TAKES EFFECT BUT I I DON'T SEE THE HUGE RISK TODAY IN LETTING THAT BEEN. GOING TO AFFECT STUDY THE IMPACTS -- OR FRANKLY HOLD THIS IN TAKE A LOOK AT IT NEXT YEAR EVEN ONCE WE HAVE A LITTLE BETTER PERSPECTIVE SO I JUST WANTED. TO GET YOUR ALL'S TAKE ON IT. DO YOU THINK IT LEASE IS THAT FAIR MATH TO SAY IF I'M IF I'M SORT OF PROJECTING THE MAX IMPACT 25% FALL OFFER SO. THOSE RAID -- AND BY THE WAY THEY DO NOW SOUNDS POINTS AT 25% ILLEGAL SO IF IF WERE FALLING OFF TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY FIVE YEAH I DON'T MIND LOSING THAT PORTION THE MARKET. YEAH PLEASE WRESTLING AND ALL OF THE AUTHORS AND WRAP UP WHEN THEY WHEN THEY EVERYONE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME YES CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE NEEDS -- TO TAKASU IT'S CAUCUS SIX RIGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT STUFF. I WOULD OFFER UP IN DRAWING MY ATTENTION. TO SIR ALAN'S POINT ON THAT PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS IF WE GET TO THE FINAL PARAGRAPH. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT -- MISTER CRAVEN HAS OFFERED UP -- THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE SHOULD HOLD THE BILL UNTIL THIS DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM IT'S ARTS ARE. AT AND THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT YOU'RE HIT NON AND WHAT GUARANTEED WE HAVE AND AND WE'RE BEFORE YOU WITH A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION. I WOULD OFFER MAYBE WE START BY CUTTING THE TIME IN HALF -- YOU KNOW. TO AS FAR AS THE SUNSET EXTENSION -- WITH A LEGISLATIVE REVIEW -- AND SOME KIND OF SIGN OFFER MANDATE MAYBE WITH THE FISH AND WILDLIFE -- SO THAT WAS WHAT WE SAID A MARKER BECAUSE I DO AGREE DEADLINES DRIVE. RESULTS RIGHT AND WE'VE SEEN THAT HERE IN LEGISLATURE -- WERE DEADLINE DRIVEN -- BODY SO LET'S USE THIS VEHICLE TO YOU KNOW SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE HERE SO TO SPEAK AND ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL THAT I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING FORTH AND SURROUNDS PUTTING FORTH AND SIR HERTZBERG. TO IN FACT YOU KNOW CALL THE CALL THE QUESTION AND REQUIRE SYSTEM TO PUT IN PLACE IF WE'RE GOING TO FOR THAT RIGHT AND ALSO MAYBE SET A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE OUTSIDE OF JUST -- THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES RIGHT I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT -- IT'S IMPORTANT STANDARD THAT MAYBE HAS BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS BODY AND IN A VARIETY OF BILLS SO WOULD BE COMMITTEE ENTERTAIN. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED IN IN A NARROW APPLICATION TO DEAL WITH THIS RESEARCH ISSUE BECAUSE I AM SENSE OF THOSE GAPS. BUT I THINK THE DEADLINE IS ALREADY IN LAW FOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKET TO DO THEIR THING I MEAN HERE IT IS CLOCKS TAKEN ON THE END OF THIS YEAR -- AND SO. I I THINK THE LAW ITSELF ALLOWS THAT DEADLINE I MEAN IF IF YOU COME IN WITH THAT TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAMMING IT'S THAT'S ONE THING BUT YEAH I I SEE THE DEADLINE IS BEING THERE. I WOULD I BE OPEN TO THIS THIS MEDICAL RESEARCH CONCEPT OF SO FAR WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN HAD AS TAYLOR. HAD THAT ISSUE IN PARTICULAR BUT YES I THINK I WOULD RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE MATURED SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED IN ANY PREVIOUS LEGISLATION -- THE GOAL OF TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM BY THIS DATE RIGHT WE'VE GOT WE'VE NOT LAY DOWN THE MARKET I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT IS WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY OKAY FINE. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT EXTENSION IS I DO KNOW THAT DISRUPTING. PRIVATE MARKETS DOESN'T SERVE ANYONE YOU KNOW THESE IMPORTANT REVENUES THAT -- JUST LIKE THEY DO IN MY HOME DISTRICTS. HELPS PRESERVE AND SECURE THESE -- THESE WETLANDS AND THAT HAS. BENEFITS THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT -- SO WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DISRUPT THE MARKET IN SAYING WE'RE GONNA STOP AND WE MIGHT REINSTATE IT LATER -- YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS WE FIND OURSELVES TO BE -- HONORABLE UNPREDICTABLE PRIVATE SECTOR MARKETS DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO TAKE FROM OUR ACTIONS AND SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND IN IN HOW WE WE PROCEED THERE BUT SOME BRIEF EXTENSION OF TIME I WOULD OFFER UP TO CUT THE TIME IN HALF. BUT PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE HAS A DIFFERENT OPINION THAN THAT BUT SOME EXTENSION WITH THE ABSOLUTE MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO ACHIEVE THIS -- TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY BY THE STATE PERIOD RIGHT AND WE SET THE MARKET THE LEGISLATURE SENT A MESSAGE AND WE'VE ACHIEVED MULTIPLE PUBLIC POLICY GOALS WHICH I WOULD TAKE THE COMMITTEE FOR THAT -- GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION OKAY -- I'D BE WILLING TO LOOK AT THE STUDYING OF MARKET DISRUPTION BECAUSE I I AM AGAIN SENSITIVE NOT JUST TO THE MEDICAL RESEARCH BUT ALSO THE WETLANDS PIECE. AND MEMBERS ARE WELCOME. TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THEIR OWN DISCRETION -- YEAH I I I DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO HEAVY OF A THUMB ON THE SCALE HERE -- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY -- I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE. WAITING AND SEEING. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND NOT TRYING TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IN SOME BIG COLLAPSE HERE AND SEEING IF IT IS TRULY THAT CATASTROPHIC FRIENDS IS ON THE WETLAND SIDE ON THE MEDICAL RESEARCH SIDE? AND REVISITING IT NEXT YEAR -- SO I'M SURE THEY'LL BE THAT OR TRYING TO ACTUALLY PUT IN PLACE -- BEFORE LIKE BEFORE WE DO RE OPEN. DOING THIS SORT OF TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM SO JUST SORT OF FLIPPING THE ORDER IN OTHER WORDS -- CONDITIONING THE EXTENSION ON THE SORT OF SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION TO TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM. IN ADVANCE OF ANY -- OPENING BUT THAT SOME YOU KNOW SOME FINING OR PRESENTATION AFTER YOU MADE I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS SORT OPEN ENDED NATURE OF IT DOING IT IN THAT ORDER. I GUESS THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF MY CONCERN. YOU CAN GO OUT YEAH JUST EXPLAIN THE PRO TEMPORE TRYING TO WORK ON IT. SO -- DO WE WANT TO TRY TO THINK PROCEDURALLY HOW TO HOW BEST TO DO THIS -- DO WE WANT TO LEAVE THE MEASURE ON ON HOLD AND TALK THIS THROUGH DO WE HAVE ANY PERSPECTIVES ON I MEAN THIS THIS NARAL. MEDICAL RESEARCH ISSUE SEEMS SOLVABLE -- I JUST I'M NOT WILLING TO OPEN UP. A VERY TOUGH TO REGULATE COMMERCIAL MARKET WITH. INDISTINGUISHABLE PRODUCTS COMING DOWN. HAVE PAIN AND SUFFERING IN THIS. THE CORE OF WHERE THEY COME FROM -- AS A STATE IT IS IT'S TOO MUCH -- SO SHERMAN YEAH PLEASE I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED. LVM LEASE UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM IF IN FACT WE HAD A EXTENSION IT WAS A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME THE FIVE YEARS AND IF IN FACT WE MANDATED THIS TRACK AND TRACE TECHNOLOGY. BY THAT SUCH DATE WHATEVER THAT DATE -- THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD DECIDE DOES THAT MEET YOUR METRIC OR YOU SAYING YOU KNOW I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT I'M SAYING WE COULD DO. I'D BE INTERESTED IN GETTING TRACK AND TRACE UP BEFORE ANY EXTENSION OCCURRED BUT WE DON'T HAVE TRACK AND TRACE TODAY AND THE EXTENT EXPIRES NOW SO THAT OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE RIGHT. WELL I I MEAN I I DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY INDUSTRY I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF IS IS A SIX MONTH PERIOD BEFORE YOU CAN GET SOMETHING UP AND RUNNING I I'M NOT SURE WHAT TIME LINES ARE ACTUALLY LIKE THERE SO. SO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GELANG REPRESENTING THE FARMING INDUSTRY. VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES ARE CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED. WHAT'S BEEN MISSING QUITE FRANKLY IS. A GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED FOR THOSE COMPANIES TO COOPERATE AND COLLABORATE WITHOUT FEAR OF ANTI TRUST ARE OTHER CONCERNS. TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER UNDERSTANDING THE YELLOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THAT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE NOT JUST TO THEMSELVES BUT TO THE FOREIGN FIFTY SMALL MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA. WHO NEED THAT TECHNOLOGY I THINK. WE'RE PREPARED TO HAVE OUR FEET. TO THE FIRE. TO MAKE THIS TECHNOLOGY REALITY EACH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING. DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW HAS DIFFERENT ISSUES FIGHT EACH TECHNOLOGY HAS. HAS SOME CAPABILITY BUT ALSO SOME DOWNSIDES. THE INDUSTRY KNOWS THAT THIS MUST HAPPEN A MUST HAPPEN QUICKLY I THINK PROVIDING THAT BOTH INCENTIVE AND AND WORKING WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE NGOS. DEVELOP THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY AND MAKE SURE IT WORKS WE'RE READY TO DO WERE READY TO HAVE OUR FEET PUT TO THE FIRE. WE JUST NEED THE CONTEXT IN WHICH TO DO THAT WITHOUT. PULLING OUT THE UNDERPINNING OF THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT UNDERSTOOD I I THINK WE'RE HAVING A SORT OF ALLIGATOR THE EGGS. WHICH COMES FIRST -- DISCUSSION IN AND SO. I'M IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT THERE'S OPEN IS. TO SPEEDING UP IN FIGURING OUT A TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM. TIMELINE WISE [inaudible] DON'T. GIVE US YOUR SENSE OF IT WITH THIS GOVERNMENT SANCTION I MEAN IF WE IF THIS BILL WAS FOR INSTANCE TO SAY. JUST SETTING UP A TRACK AND TRACE PROGAM THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. AND THEN CONDITIONING ANY. EXTENSION OF THE BANDS. REVERSAL -- ABATEMENT. ON THE THAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT SANCTIONING. THROUGH SORT OF NOT DOING THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS AS THE TIME AS THE SHOT CLOCK BUT INTO THIS YEAR IS THE SHOT CLOCK. BUT THAT WE WOULD OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL CONSISTENCY TO SOME DETERMINATION BUT THEN -- ALLOWED. TO LOOK AT TWO AND A HALF OR EVEN FIVE I MEAN I I THINK I'M I THINK IF IF I FELT CERTAIN I THINK TO BE A LOT MORE OPENNESS I THINK. I MIGHT SUGGEST CENTER THAT -- IF WE WERE GOING TO ESTABLISH A TRACK AND TRACE PROBLEM IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. YOU JUST LEFT THE SUNSET ALL THE ALL TOGETHER I WOULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR A SUNSET TO SUNSET WOULD BE TO DRIVE THE DEADLINE WILL BE TO DRIVE THE BEHAVIOR RIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET BEYOND X. DATE. WITHOUT IMPLEMENTING X. PROGRAM AND OF COURSE WE AND WE PUT SUNSET DATES INTO LEGISLATION FOR LEGISLATIVE REVIEW THAT'S EXACTLY THE PURPOSE. IF WE ACHIEVED THE OUTCOME OR LOOKING FOR WE COULD PULL THE SUNSET ALL TOGETHER I DON'T THINK ESPECIALLY THE INTEREST I I PREFER THE IDEA OF KEEPING THE SUNSET IN PLACE. FOR PERPETUAL LEGISLATIVE REVIEW AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE GOOD PRACTICES AND BEST PRACTICES OR NOT BUT LET'S SET A GOAL TODAY THAT WE CAN FORCE THE INDUSTRY. TO GET THE STRUCTURES THE AND IF THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE YEAR -- IF IT'S NOT TWO AND A HALF YEARS FROM NOW WHAT IS IT IS IT IS IT YOU KNOW JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A JANUARY -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS JERRY TORRE TWENTY THREE I DON'T KNOW WOULD BE OPEN TO THE IMPORTANT TO ME BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A NICE LANDING SPOT -- CAUCUS IN TIME IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS OPEN ENDED FOR SOME DISCUSSION AMONG MEMBERS THEN COME BACK FOR A VOTE ONLY. AND KICKING THE TIRES LOW FOR THE HERE BUT BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT MY BOTTOM LINE I'M NOT JUST WILLING TO GO. ON GOOD FAITH OPEN ENDED HERE AT AND THAT'S AND I AND I TRULY THINK IF A WORD ABOUT THE MEDICAL RESEARCH PIECE. I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THAT HERE TODAY -- ACT I REALLY DO THINK IT'S DOABLE IF THAT IS THE NARROW ISSUE WELL. IF I MAY AT LEAST I AGREE. THIS PLACE IS ABOUT HURRY UP THING WAITING THAT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE HERE AND NOTHING HAPPENS UNLESS THERE'S SOLID DEADLINES AND YOU ARE CORRECT BUT THAT IN I AGREE WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY THAT IF WE EXTENDED THE SUNSET IN BY. WHATEVER DAY WE DECIDE THAT'S NOT DONE THEN THIS BILL THE US SUNSET IS ENACTED SOLD NOTHING. IN THIS HOUSE OR IN THIS BUILDING HAPPENS WITHOUT THOSE DEADLINES AND SO IF WE CAN. EXTEND AGAIN EITHER TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY THREE WHAT WHATEVER'S A PLEASURE OF THE COMMITTEE BUT IF THAT IS THE TRACKING SYSTEM IS NOT IN PLACE BY EX STATE. THAN THAN BAD VOIGTS THAT THAT EXTENSION. YEAH I GUESS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE REVERSE ORDER THAT IS HAVING TRACK AND TRACE THEN LOOK IN THE EXTENSION IS DOING EXTENSION THEN LOOKING AT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. MR STERN YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO TO GO THROUGH THESE TYPES OF POLICIES AND TRYING TO GET IT BACK ON HERE. BECAUSE I THE OPPOSITION IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE TRACK INTRIGUED TRACK AND TRACE OTHER THERE'S OTHER ISSUES AND SO SO SO ONCE THIS IS GONE TRYING TO GET IT BACK ON IS NEARLY. IMPOSSIBLE YOU KNOW THAT IN A AND WE KNOW THAT AND AND IF. ABSOLUTELY WE'RE HERE AND THAT'S THE POINT RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN COME TO A COMPROMISE THE OPPOSITION IS NOT WILLING TO COMPROMISE IF THERE IS A AN EXTENSION AND THAT'S WHY. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE AND FOR YOU TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND THAT'S THE COMPROMISE THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR SO THAT IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IT SATISFIES YOUR YOUR REQUEST. RIGHT IF BY EX DATE IT'S NOT DONE THEN THIS THIS IS COMPLETE BILLS WHATEVER THE TWO YEARS TWO AND A HALF. IS COMPLETELY GONE I THINK THAT WOULD DRIVE THE THE URGENCY WOULD DRIVE DOWN THE INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH THAT TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM. I APPRECIATE THAT -- IT FEELS PRETTY URGENT TO THEM RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE ALL HERE -- AND SO. AT THIS POINT. I WANT TO SEE I MEAN IS MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE JUST THE PERSPECTIVE OF ONE MEMBER HERE BUT I THINK THE DEADLINE WE'VE GOTTEN LAW IS THE DRIVER. I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THIS A TRACK AND TRACE STUDY BILL. OR BUT ALSO RESEARCH MIL BUT MISTER TEN RESIDENT YOU CAN SPEND SOME TIME IF YOU WANT DURING RECESS WHEN WE GO OFF AND DO SOME THINKING. BUT THE AGAIN THE GOOD FAITH LIKE TAKE ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF AND FIGURED OUT THAT IF IT WORKS. NINE WERE FROM GAIN BUT OUT AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE DID CALL WE CALL THE OPPOSITION FOR STAKEHOLDER MEETING AND NOBODY SHOWED UP. SO SO YOU'RE PUTTING ON THESE YOU KNOW THESE REQUIREMENTS BUT WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT AT THE TABLE WE CAN'T HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS THE SHERMAN OCCURRED BEFORE EVEN I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT WE AT LEAST BE AFFORDED. THE DURATION OF THE SESSION TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT AND A IN ORDER TO DO THAT. OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH THIS EXPIRES RIGHT IF WE EXTENDED IT TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WOULD -- HAVE IN PLACE A ALMOST AS URGENT DEADLINE IS ONLY ONE YEAR -- ADDITIONAL TIME -- MAYBE WE COULD WORK SOME COOPERATION THEM WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE AND HAVE THE DIRECTOR PLAY SOME ROLE IN -- IN YOU KNOW. MONITORING THE PROGRESS AND A AND AN ADDRESS THAT BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW. UNLESS THE INDUSTRY'S PREPARED TO TELL US TODAY THAT THEY CAN HAVE A TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM IN PLACE BY JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE INDUSTRY AND I'LL LET THEM SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. I THINK A A MINIMUM ONE YEAR I WOULD SAY TWO YEARS -- TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWITTER TO BUT GIVEN YOU KNOW YOUR STRONG FEELINGS THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN. THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE AND I DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT -- PERHAPS A WHEN YOUR SCHEDULE ALLOWS TO MOVE FORWARD WE COULD STICK TO TRACK AND TRACE LANGUAGE AND WE COULD. ENGAGE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE AND AND REALLY START TO SET A MODEL THAT WOULD SERVE THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATURE ON OTHER BILLS AS WELL. IN CASE GET SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM THE OTHER THE OPPOSITION STAKEHOLDERS AND THEN. HI THIS IS A VERY ROBUST HEALTHY CONVERSATION HERE SO I APPRECIATE IT -- BUT JUST IN TERMS OF PROCESS WISE IN RIGHT -- SO UP. BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH THE TRACKING TRACES. WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE STATE OF LOUISIANA COULD POSSIBLY PUT IN A TRACK AND TRACE I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT COULD BE DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEXAS FLORIDA VIETNAM? BOB WAY PLACES ALL AROUND THE WORLD. ANY ANYTHING THAT THE FOLKS HERE COULD COME UP WITH WOULD NOT AFFECT THOSE PLACES THOSE PRODUCTS THOSE ANIMALS WILL BE COMING INTO THE CITY CALIFORNIA BEING SOLD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THEY COULD CRAFT THAT WOULD PULL THOSE COUNTRIES IN. YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN UP THEIR SITE IS TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN QUICKLY AND JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS. THIS IS FOR THE MEDICAL PORTION YOU CAN HAVE. A LIVE ANIMALS COME INTO THE STATE SO RESEARCH PLACES COULD HAVE LIVE TRUCKS COME IN AND THEN THEY HANDLE THEM WITHIN THE RESEARCH LAB. WE KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT LAW YEAH UNDER CURRENT LAW UNDER THE IF THE BAND GO WENT INTO PLACE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE READ ALOUD FOR RESEARCH BUT ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY SOLD. THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT WOULD BE AN ISSUE -- WILL TAKE ONE MORE COMMENT PERHAPS ADDRESS THAT LAST POINT SO -- EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO IMPORT LIVE ALLIGATORS IN THE STATE IN ORDER TO CONDUCT RESEARCH THE AVAILABILITY THE SUPPLY OF THOSE ALLIGATORS WOULD BE THREATENED BECAUSE THE FUNDING FOR THE FARMS IN PARTICULAR IN THE WETLANDS PRESERVATION WOULD BE DIMINISHED WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER SO. IF YOU INCREASE THE COST OF THE RAW MATERIAL YOU INCREASE THE COST OF THE RESEARCH WHICH MEANS THE RESEARCH WILL BE DONE. BUT UNLIKE THE RESEARCH DONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THAT RESEARCH WILL BE DONE IN NEVADA OR MINNESOTA OR YOU TO OR ANOTHER STATE YOU'RE SAYING A 25% REDUCTION IN A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY WILL DRIVE UP THE COST OF THOSE PARTS SUCH THAT IT WOULD BE. NOT COST EFFECTIVE DO THAT RESEARCH ANYMORE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED ELSEWHERE BUT THEN LET'S MAKE THIS WORK ON A MEDICAL RESEARCH EXEMPTION HERE AND THEN MAKE THAT THE CONDITION OF THE THE TWO AND A HALF YEAR THE ONE YEAR SOLELY FOR THOSE PURPOSES SO WE DON'T DO ANY HARM. BUT THEN DON'T AUTHORIZE THIS COMMERCIAL MARKET IN THE MEANTIME. BUT THAT EXEMPTION COULDN'T PRICE SAID THE RAW MATERIALS THE NO NO YOU TO STUDY THAT ISSUE AND YOU SEE IF THERE'S SOME. YEAH. WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT RESEARCH FOLLOWS FUNDING AND THE FUNDING SOURCES WILL GO TO OTHER STATES BECAUSE THE COST OF THOSE MATERIALS CAN GET A CHEAPER SO THAT RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED ELSEWHERE. IN IF WE DEVELOP THE CURE THEY WILL BE DEVELOPED IN OTHER STATES IRAQ'S THAT'S THE RISK YEAH I I THINK. THERE'S YOU CAN ARGUE THAT RISK THE RISK OF FURTHER IN BOLD INNING IN INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE TRACKING FEENEY. TRAFFICKING INDUSTRY FOR TWO YEARS. TELL ME FAR OUTWEIGHS THAT RISK AND I THINK WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT RISK HEAD ON RIGHT NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL IN DOING. A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION ON JUST THE MEDICAL RESEARCH PIECE -- AND THEN LOOKING GIVING THE SHOT CLOCK ON GETTING TRACK ENTRY SANCTION UP AND RUNNING AND THEN REVISITING THIS SPANISH IN THE FUTURE SO I AGAIN I I'M WILLING TO SOLVE. THAT PROBLEM HERE I JUST DON'T KNOW. I DON'T. I CAN'T. GO ON BLIND FAITH OR EVEN. ANY KIND OF FAITH RIGHT NOW IN THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT TO THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT'S COMPLIANCE WITH PUTTING RFID CHIPS IN. YOU KNOW THESE CRACKS ME AYE AYE EIGHT WE HAVE A TOUGH ENOUGH TIME ENFORCING LABOR LAWS AND ALL THE REST OF IT SO THAT'S WHERE I'M STRUGGLING. YEAH ARE YOU JUST MEASURE THE WEEK. AGAIN I'M I'M GET LOST BECAUSE IF WE HAVE A TRACK INTEREST PROGRAM. AND IF WE REQUIRE FOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW SOME OF US LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT IN FACT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- WE JUST RUN CALIFORNIA BUT NONE THE LESS. WE COULD HAVE A PROGRAM THAT RESTRICTS SO CELLS OF ANY PLACE THAT DOESN'T COMPLY WITH THEIR TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM IF THE TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE SORRY IT'S AN ABSURD READ HER ARGUMENT TO SUGGEST WHILE THERE WAS NO WAY TO CONTROL. OUT THERE IN FACT IS. WHEN YOU START YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN DEALING? HAVE WHATEVER IN IT AND IT'S NOT A LOT IT'S NOT ALLOWED IN. HAS IT AND SO OF LOUISIANA CAN MEET THAT STANDARD OF FLORIDA CAN MEET THAT STANDARD -- GREAT IF VIETNAM CAN'T WELL THEY'RE NOT SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS HERE RIGHT -- I'M NOT HERE TODAY CERTAINLY WORTH THAT I AM HERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WETLANDS IN LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA AND THE IMPACT OUR MARKET HAS ON THOSE AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE ARE UP AGAINST A DEADLINE I WISH WE WERE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE A YEAR AGO BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY. AND WE NEED MORE TIME -- I THINK WE NEED A COUPLE YEARS. I OFFERED UP TO THE COMMITTEE PERHAPS WE CAN JUST DO A ONE YEAR EXTENSION TO AT LEAST GET US TO THE END OF THE SESSION SO THAT WE CAN WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU. AND THE COMMITTEE TO PUT IN PLACE HARD DEADLINES ON A TRACK AND TRACE AND ANY OTHER -- REFINEMENTS OF CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WE THINK ARE APPLICABLE ARE NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ONLY DEALING IN A LEGAL PRODUCT WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND TREATIES AND SO ON SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HELP IN -- DRAFTING OPPOSE THAT GIVES US AT LEAST THAT ONE YEAR IF NOT TWO YEAR PERIOD OF TIME TO ACCOMPLISH SO SIX AND SUCH A HARD DEADLINE ON TRACK ENTRIES WE DON'T HAVE THAT LONG NOW WE DON'T HAVE BY TWENTY TWENTY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TRACKING TRICKS. LET'S PUT THAT IN WHAT WHAT WHAT LET'S YOUR SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP ON THAT ISSUE -- NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA FOR THE COUNTRY. I THINK THAT'S A COMPELLING ARGUMENT. I WOULD SAY LET'S LET'S JUST DO THAT THEN IN THE BILL AND NOT BUT NOT THE IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL WE HAVE IT. WE JUST START HOPE IT WORKS OUT I MEAN I THAT THAT'S THE THING IS. WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE GAP? WHAT WHAT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE GAPS OF THE ONES? YEAH SORRY BUT LOOK AT I WERE I DON'T WANT. TO YOU CERTAINLY DON'T IT CENTER COVER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WITH CAUCUS. OTHER. BUT I'M THE ONE KEEPING THIS COMMITTEE GOT A FRIEND OVER THERE I THINK WE CAN WORK CAN YEAH YEAH I UNDERSTAND -- DID YOU A QUICK COMMENT CENTER GO HERE WELL I HEY I GUESS I WANTED TO BRING THIS TO COME TO A CONCLUSION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND I WHAT I HEAR. WE HAVE THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW THE STATUS QUO IS WORKING. SO I SUGGEST WE TAKE THE OFFER THAT WAS MADE WHICH IS. TO AB IT EXTENDED FOR A YEAR OR TWO I THINK THE TRACK AND TRACE IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO IN AND QUITE FRANKLY IF WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BE IF WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS. IN THE LEAFY GREEN. OUR AREA -- WE CERTAINLY. AND WE'RE DOING IT IN IN THE MARIJUANA CONTEXT WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT WITH WITH -- LIVE ANIMALS AND SO I I JUST THINK WE CAN GET THERE I THINK WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO DO IT. I'M PREPARED TO MOVE MOVE THAT WE MOVE THE BELT WITH THEY WONDER TO WHATEVER THE CHAIR -- AB FED WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE EXTENSION SO THAT THE STATUS QUO CAN CONTINUE AND WITH THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE CREATE THIS TRACK AND TRACE. PROGRAM -- AND IT'D BE UP AND RUNNING WITHIN IT WITH A DATE CERTAIN SO THAT WE GET WHAT WE REALLY WANT WHICH IS MY I THINK. WHAT THE THAT THE ANOMALY HERE IS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE STE AND AN ANIMAL OVER THERE THERE IS -- STRONG FEELINGS AGAINST USING THEIR PRODUCTS BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO HELP THE WETLANDS WHICH IS DESPERATELY IMPORTANT ON AIR AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE FARMING CAN. SUSTAINABLE FARMING OF THE ANIMALS CONTINUES THAT'S HOW WE IT SUPPORTED AND SO ANYWAY THAT THAT WOULD BE MY MOTION IF THE CHAIR -- I DESIRE BUT MIGHT MY ONLY DISAGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS I DON'T THINK IT'S AS CLOSE WORKING. AND I AND I'M NOT WILLING TO EXTEND THIS WHY WHY ISN'T WORKING ON THAT'S MY QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR A MORE INTERNATIONALLY. WILDLIFE TRADE WHERE ANIMALS ARE BEING CUT AT THE BACK OF THEIR NECKS AND RAM ROGER RAM DOWN THEIR SPINE I MEAN LIKE I MEAN. WE'LL STUFF DON'T HAVE SOMETHING INTO OUR COMMERCE AND I DON'T WANT THOSE PRODUCTS THE ENDING UP IN ST LOUIS VUITTON STORE INSTEAD OF CAO FINE IS AN AGREED BUT THAT'S THE THE VIETNAM AND WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT DOUBLES PRODUCTS. NOT BE IMPORTED ONES GIVE US TIME TO DO THE TRACK IN BETWEEN GIVE US TIME ALLOWS IT FOR THAT TIME. TO THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU SAY GIVE US TIME IT GIVES US TIME TO ALLOW MORE THAT PRODUCT COME IN IF YOU WANT TO CUT IT OFF. ON THE CURRENT STATUTORY DEADLINE AND THEN SET UP A PROGRAM WE CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION -- I'M I'M VERY OPEN TO THAT BUT IT'S THE ORDERING AT THINGS I THINK WE'RE GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES A LITTLE BIT HERE SO. I I'M I'M HAPPY ALSO ENTERTAIN THAT MOTION I'D I DON'T CONSIDER THAT HOSTILE THEM IF YOU WANNA MAKE THAT BUT I CAN'T BE THERE ON ON THAT KIND OF SORT OF ONE YEAR TO YEAR -- AND THEN THAT THE SHOT CLOCK IS HERE NOW -- AND IF YOU ALREADY TO COME FORTH WITH YOU KNOW A PRODUCT THAT WORKS TODAY GREAT IF NOT -- LET'S WORK ON A MEDICAL ISSUE OR LET'S SEE IF IT EVEN IMPACTS THE INDUSTRY IS YOU'RE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT SO -- ANY ON THIS ISSUE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS SIR COME HERE THANK YOU CLOSE TO MINE I WILL MAKE THIS MY CLOSELY -- AND THE REVIEWS SAY -- I WOULD WELCOME A MOTION. I THINK. YOUR POINT SHERMAN YOU'RE IN A PLACE OF TWENTY TWENTY IS A DEADLINE PERIOD THE END NO. NO EXTENSION WEATHER HAS TRACK CONTRITION NOT WHERE WE ARE IN AGREEMENT AS WE'D ALL LIKE TO SEE TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM THAT THAT IS THE AREA OF AGREEMENT WE FOUND HERE. IF. IF YOU WOULD MAKE A MOTION SIR CARRIER THAT WOULD EXTEND US A PERIOD OF TIME. WITH A HARD DEADLINE OF GETTING THAT TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW I SAID TWO YEARS. PEOPLE SAID ONE YEAR MAYBE MAYBE YEAR AND A HALF MAYBE EIGHTEEN MONTHS WOULD BE NICE -- AND THAT'S THE HARD DEADLINE AND I CAN TELL THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIRMAN A REAL SO I WILL NOT BE BACK BEFORE YOU -- ASKING FOR MORE TIME I WILL WORK WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT THE INDUSTRY MEET THAT DEADLINE -- IT BEING A HARD DEADLINE. I'M HERE TO MAKE THE MOTION -- AND THE AND I MAY BE THE ONLY ONE THAT SUPPORTS IT BUT I I I I MOVE THAT WE WE ACCEPT. SUPPORT THE BELL WITH A TRACK AND TRACE REQUIREMENT IN IT AS WELL IT'S NOT THERE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE AMENDED -- AND THAT WE WE GIVE THEM A YEAR AND A HALF.

AND ENHANCE. OUR BEAUTIFUL SANTA MONICA BAY AND THE AND THE WATERSHED THAT SURROUNDS IT. AB FIFTEEN ELEVEN UPDATES THE STATUTES GOVERNING THE COMMISSION BY REPLACING THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IS THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. WITH THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY. AND IT REVISES THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION GIVING AT NEW GOALS RELATED TO THE RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE BAND WATERSHED THAT WERE ALSO ADOPTED AND APPROVED. BY THE COMMISSION IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE REVISED PURPOSE AND GOALS OF THE COMMISSION CREATE A NATURAL ALIGNMENT WITH THE ROLE OF THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY WHO ALREADY PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR GRANTS AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE COMMISSION. AND THE BILL DOES NOT IN ANYWAY ALL TO THE COMMISSION'S GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE NOR DOES IT CHANGE THE PUBLIC PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY. TO ADDRESS THE STRUCTURE IT'S SIMPLY REPLACES THE STATE AGENCY THAT IS CHARGED WITH ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES ONLY. THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO A MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR THIS IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT OF SANTA MONICA BAND THE WATERSHED. THE BILL IS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. TODAY SEATED NEXT TO ME IS TOM FORD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE BAY FOUNDATION WHO WILL AT HIS COMMENTS AND ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE VERY GOOD THANK. WELCOME THANK YOU. VERY VERY BRIEF AND I'VE GOT A BIG DAY -- THE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NOW IN OUR APPROACH. TRYING PROTECT PROMOTE PRESERVE ENHANCE THE ECOLOGY AND WATER QUALITY SOCIO ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF OF SANTA MONICA BANDS VALUES. SOME ARE. I THINK SO THAT WOULD BE VERY AWARE OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS CERTAINLY ARRIVED WE ARE TRYING TO MODIFY OUR APPROACH IS AND CHANGE SOME OF OUR PRIORITIES. TO DRESS AT THE DECADES OF DEDICATED WORK AND INVESTMENT IN IMPROVING WATER QUALITY ARE DELIVERING RESULTS -- AND THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO ACTUALLY CONDUCT MORE EFFECTIVE -- IN LARGER SCALE RESTORATION PROJECTS ARE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON OUR BEACHES VERY PROUD OF THE PARTNERS THAT WE WORK WITH -- AND A RESERVE MANY OF MY ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU TODAY IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. SHE THAT -- DO HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE ANY OTHERS. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR HELPING US THROUGH THIS. INNOVATION AN EVOLUTION OF WHAT THE THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN AND KNOW THE HISTORY IS LONG. THE ONE OFFERED OPPORTUNITY TO THE CENTER OF JURISDICTION EVEN THOUGH WE SHARE THE SANTA MONICA BAY. AT THE NORTHERN EDGE. DOWN TO THE SOUTHERN -- BUT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I MEAN I I MY STAFF IS TALK TO YOUR STAFF. SOME MEMBER AND AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY SINCE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I KNOW THERE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES WITH ON ISSUES RELATED. TO YOU KNOW NOW SENATOR I'M SORRY AS A SIGN UP IN A A LOT OF AMBIENT NOISE YEAH YEAH. ANOTHER BILL YOUR INVOLVEMENT I THINK OUTSIDE. SO [inaudible] ANYHOW -- I GUESS MY MY QUESTION WELL IT DID IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD THEY'RE OUT THERE ABOUT THE BILL REALLY. HAVE LESS TO DO WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL THEY HAVE TO DO WITH HER BROADER CONCERNS ABOUT. I A ISSUES IN THE EXACTLY DIRECTOR AND THE ME IN THE STRUCTURE OF OF OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PULL TOGETHER HERE SO I I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL -- I DO THINK. BUT BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE SWIRLING IN A BROADER ISSUES THAT IN REYES BY THE OPPOSITION I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK TO THEM AT ALL BUT BUT I THINK IT. WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS EMILY REASONABLE? SENATOR ALLEN YOU'VE GOT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HERE. RIGHT YEAH CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU THE BUT WHAT I WOULD SUBMIT IS THAT -- THE THE LOCAL CONTROL OF THIS PARTNERSHIP THAT DEAD ROUTE IS. INHERENT IN THE SOUND MARKET NATIONAL HISTORY PROGRAM INHERENT IN THE SANTA MONICA BAY RESTORATION COMMISSION -- IS PRECISE WHERE THAT SHOULD BE -- SO THAT BODY THE COMMISSION IS UNDERGOING. A CONSIDERATION OF ITS STRUCTURAL AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES RIGHT NOW -- THAT WE ANTICIPATE THAT IN AND YOU WILL BE PRODUCED BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR IF NOT EARLIER THAT'LL HELP CLEAR UP SOME OF THAT CONFUSION -- WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT IF IF THERE'S ANY -- ANY RESPONSIBILITY THAT HAS THAT I WOULD TAKE ON OR MY PREDECESSORS BEFORE ME THAT WE WERE VERY GOOD AT TIGHTENING UP OUR PAPERWORK SOMEWHERE SOMETIMES ALONG THE WAY. AND THE JUSTIFIABLE CONFUSION AS A RESULT BUT I THINK WE'RE READY TO DO WITH THIS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THE STATE BECAUSE CONSERVANCY ARE ON BOARD. KNOWING WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND ARE LOOKING FOR TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. YEAH I HAVE AND YOU A YOU'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE SIERRA CLUB ON THEIR CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT THE HOUSES ARE POINTS OUT THE MAYBE THEY'LL BE A CONFUSION WITH REGARDS TO THE CLUBS OPPOSITION TO THE MAYBE COMPLAIN DRINKING WATER SUPPLY WOULD PROPOSE NEW. TERM WATER SUPPLY. BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM BUT CERTAINLY THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM -- BUT I WOULD SAY IS THAT AS THE RESPONSE -- FROM THE CONSULTANT ON THIS IS THAT A LOT OF THE PROJECT THAT WE LOOK AT AREN'T INTENDED JUST. PROVIDE. IMPROVED WATER QUALITY BUT IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT AND WE HAVE A LIMITED WATER SUPPLY OR THAT WERE IN SOMETHING MORE OF A PERENNIAL DROUGHT. THAT GETTING THAT WATER BACK INTO THE GROUND RECHARGING OUR AQUIFER'S AND PUTTING LA BACK ON ITS OWN FEET FROM A LOCAL WATER STANDPOINT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO BY OUR PARTNERS IN THE REGION [inaudible] THANK YOU. VERY HELPFUL -- AND I'M SORRY BUT I BROKE PROTOCOL HERE AND DID NOT ALLOW OPTING FOR OPPOSITION TO TESTIFY. SO -- PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT ANY OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD YES. YOU CAN CHECK TO SEE IF HE IF YOU. YES WHAT WILL FREE UP THAT SEAT FOR SEX [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE CAN HAVE YOU BACK IN A MINUTE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU WATER MEMBERS IN THE BY ON A WETLANDS LAND TRUST. WE OPPOSE WITH THE UNLESS AMENDED NOT BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT WHO PROVIDES OFFICE SUPPLIES TO THE COMMISSION OF THE GUEST LIMIT AB FIFTEEN ELEVEN IS ABOUT. TO UNDERSTAND ARE CONCERNED IF YOU LOOK AT THE FROM. ASSEMBLY RELATIONS ANALYSIS YOU'LL SEE THAT. THE CONSERVANCY IS CONTEMPLATING WATER TO STATE EMPLOYEES SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT COULD BE A CUT IN HALF OF THE EXISTING CITY EMPLOYEES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. THE COMMISSION STAFF FOR DECADES HAS MOSTLY COME FROM THE FOUNDATION. DO YOU ARE BASED ON AN AGREEMENT THAT'S VERY CLEAR AT STILL ARCHIVED ON THE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE. IN WHICH THE FOUNDATION WOULD GET THE FEDERAL USEPA FUNDS. AND WOULD IT TAKE THOSE FUNDS TO HIRE THE COMMISSION STAFF SOME TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE EIGHTEEN COMMISSION STAFF POSITIONS. LISTED IN THE WORK PLAN AND THESE FOLKS WERE DOING AGENCY WORK THINGS LIKE PRESS RELEASES FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR. SITTING HERE DOING BUDGETARY WORK TO THE MINISTRY OF DR SO ANY STAKEHOLDER THE COMMISSION WE DON'T CARE ABOUT WHERE THE OFFICE SUPPLIES COME FROM WE CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT. WHAT WAS A FULLY STAFFED STATE AGENCIES DOES NOT A FULLY STAFFED STATE AGENCY? AND THAT THIS AGENCIES NOT GOING TO IN DEPEND BE ABLE TO INDEPENDENTLY EXECUTE THE DUTIES THAT THE EXISTING LEGISLATION. AND THE FUTURE LEGISLATION INCLUDE THE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS THAT. STATE DISSIPATION IN THE ANY P. IS NEVER INTERFERENCE IT'S ACTUALLY REQUIREMENTS TO FIT THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT. THIS IS A THIRTY ONE YEAR OUR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE WATER BOARDS AND THAT THE COMMISSION WHICH USED TO BE CALLED THE PROJECT. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. COMPELLING CHANGE THE ACTION PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN OCTOBER EXPRESSLY EMPHASIZES THE CONTINUITY OF THE MISSION OF THE COMMISSION. AGAIN IT'S A CLEAN WATER ACT PROGRAM SO THERE'S NOT A MOVEMENT AWAY FROM CLEAN WATER AND THE OTHER ISSUES IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE COASTAL ACCESS. HABITAT RESTORATION HAVE LONG BEEN PRIORITIES OF THE COMMISSION. SO WE WOULD SIMPLY ASK. IS THAT. IF THIS IF. IF THE WAY THAT THE COMMISSION HAS STARTED RUNNING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. THERE SHOULD BE A VERY PRECISE LEGISLATIVE BILL FOR LOTS OF THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING ON IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT. THEN WE WOULD ASK YOU. TO THINK ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE WHAT WE BELIEVE IS HAPPENING HERE IS THAT. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT. THAT WHEN THE PUBLIC TRIES TO ENFORCE STATE TRANSPARENCY LAWS AND PUBLIC INTEREST LAWS. THE ARGUMENT GOING TO BE THAT YOU FOLKS ENDORSED. THIS DIMINISHMENT OF THE OF THE COMMISSION PROPERLY STAFF STATE AGENCY AN AGENCY THAT DOES NOT STAFF DIED. I WOULD JUST ARGUE THAT. THE THE THE SALES AND THE WRITER. AND THE CREW RIGHT OF THIS VESSEL HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND IT'S IT'S NOW JUST SORT OF FLOATING IN A DINGY BEHIND THE FOUNDATION. AND THAT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A KNOCK ON THE FOUNDATION IT'S MEANT TO BE. A PROTECTION AGAIN OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST WHEN THIS COMMISSION WAS GREAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THAT WAS A MULTI YEAR MULTI STEP VERY DELIBERATE OF PROCESS. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE THIS. WAS WRITTEN SO INNOCUOUS AN INNOCUOUS LEE. THAT ANYONE FELT THE NEED TO READ THROUGH ANY OF THOSE DOCUMENTS. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT HISTORY TO UNDERSTAND WHY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A. B.. FIFTEEN ELEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATED -- WE'VE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION HERE TODAY. OKAY SEEING NONE -- BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS OR MAYBE GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND AS SOME OF THOSE CRITICISMS I I DIDN'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE FULL NATURE OF THE OPPOSITION UNTIL JUST NOW SO -- YEAH -- WHAT IT WOULD DO WE SAVE BACK? TO THE THOSE CONCERNS HE CHANGES THAT THIS BILL BRING FORWARD ARE RELATIVELY LIMITED THE OVERSIGHT OF THE AGENCY IS GOING. TO RESIDE. WITH A DIFFERENT AGENCY THAT'S GOING TO ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF THE BAY RESTORATION COMMISSION TO DO WHAT IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHARTERED TO DO AND THAT'S TO LOOK OUT FOR THE BEST INTEREST. OF SANTA MONICA BAY AND THE AND THE WATERSHED. YEAH WHAT WHAT I MIGHT DODD ADD OF CURRENTLY THE WATER RESOURCE QUALITY CONTROL BOARD FOR A PROVIDES ONE POINT TWO P. WHY -- TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSION -- THE SOME OF THE DESCRIPTION THAT MISTER LAMB JUST PROVIDED FOR US -- THAT THE STATE STAFFING USED TO BE VERY -- THAT MUCH MORE ELEVATED THAN IT IS NOW THAT THE FOUNDATION SORT OF GOBBLED UP THOSE PEOPLE -- THE THERE WAS A TRADITION DURING THE THOSE. POSITIONS WERE NEVER REPLACED -- ALL OF THE WORK THAT THE FOUNDATION HAS DONE. TO USE THE MONEY THAT THEY UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENT TEXTING Z. PROVIDES TO THIS PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP. LOCAL STATE FEDERAL BOMB HAS HAS HAD GREAT SUCCESS -- I THINK WE'RE MAKING A SMART MOVE TO FIND A AGENCY IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF CONSERVANCY THAT IS EAGER TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM -- I THINK THEY WILL WORK HARD TO FIND SOME MORE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AND I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S REALLY. TOO MANY -- I I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS I WOULD SAY THAT WERE PRESENTED. YOU'RE SAYING AS IT DID YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR FOR READ FOR RESOURCE PURPOSES THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THE BILL. EFFORT IS A GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENT BY MAYBE THAT RESOURCE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN SERVICE ENDED TO ADEQUATE STAFFING YOU HAVE TO CHANGE. NO I WAS I WOULD SAY THAT SOME OF THE PRIORITIES -- THAT WE RECOGNIZE AS HIGHER PRIORITIES AND INCREASED PERHAPS AN ORDINATION -- DURING THIS REVISION -- OF THE PLAN IN THE APPROVAL OF A NEW PLAN IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT COASTAL ACCESS CLIMATE CHANGE. ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE PLANNING AND NUMBER OF THOSE ASPECTS. ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE EXPERTISE AND THE STRATEGIC PLAN OF THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY RATHER THAN THAT OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES QUALITY CONTROL BOARD. DECADES OF IMPROVEMENT IN WATER QUALITY. YOU MIND IF I JUST AS JUST RUN THAT TO GROUND THE OPPOSITION AND I'M. ALRIGHT IN ANTICIPATE THIS. EVEN TAKE YOUR BUT GIVE A COMMENT ON THAT THAT WHAT YOU CAN YOU CAN COME UP TO THAT MY HAVE TO CONTEST THE IDEA THAT THIS IS FROM THE RECESSION FROM TWO THOUSAND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. A DROP IN STAFF FROM THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE FY TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IS A PRINTER. FORTY WORK PLAN. IN IT IT IS BLACK AND WHITE PEOPLE JUST ACTUALLY HAD THE TIME TO READ THE DOCUMENTS IT'S STILL ON THE COMMISSION WEBSITE. EIGHTEENS POSITIONS TO FROM THE STATE SIXTEEN FROM THE FOUNDATION. WE FILED THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST IN JUNE OR JULY OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITHIN TWO WEEKS. A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE EMPLOYEES. CAME OFF THE STATE AGENCY WEBSITE THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HEADED OUT BUSINESS CARDS THEY WROTE. LETTERS ON STOP GOOD GOVERNMENT AGENCY STATIONARY. THEIR EMAILS ENDED WITH COMMISSION. THEY'RE GONE. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. HAVING EIGHTEEN POSITIONS COMMISSION POSITIONS. GOING DOWN TO POTENTIALLY ONE OR TWO I AGAIN THE COMMISSION HASN'T ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE IN THREE YEARS. I USED TO HAVE A COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR AND THEY WOULD ISSUE PRESS RELEASES. THEY HAVEN'T ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE IN THREE YEARS. IS A NUMBER THAT WE WE CARE ABOUT THE VIOLENCE. WHEN THE DRAFT A ARE CAME OUT? THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT OF THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS. THE ONLY REASON THEY GAVE AS TO WHY THEY COULDN'T WAY IN. WHICH IS WHAT THE LEGISLATION MANDATES RIGHT MONITOR ASSESS COORDINATED BY THE ONLY REASON THAT WAS GIVEN WAS THE LIMITED STAFF CAPACITY OF THE COMMISSION. SO WE HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON TO CARE ABOUT THIS DROP AND STAFF. I WOULD SAY ONE QUICK QUESTION IF I COULD JUST PUT IT IN. FOR YOU DO SO SO THE SENATE THE ISSUE THE CONCERN FROM THE OPPOSITION IS ABOUT. THE LACK OF RESOURCES. GOING INTO STAFFING POSITIONS IN SORT OF LEAVING A SHELL OF THE COMMISSION. IS THIS BILL. ADDRESS RESOURCES IN ANY WAY OR IS THIS MORE ABOUT. GOVERNANCE AND REORGANIZATION IN YOUR MIND IS IT'S THE LATTER -- THE REASON FOR THE CHANGE HERE IT IS -- BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT -- CAN BE PROVIDED BY THE CONSERVANCY IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE GOALS AND THE MISSION OF THE CONSERVANCY THAN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES. CONTROL BOARD -- MISTER FORD CAN RESPOND. TO EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF BUT I THINK IT THAT YOU'VE HEARD BUT I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS IN ON THE FACT THAT THIS IS A VERY LIMITED CHANGE THAT'S BEING. MADE HERE -- AS FAR AS THE SOME OF THE ISSUES -- THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU. THAT I ACTUALLY. CHAIRED THE COMMISSION. THROUGH THE PERIOD OF TIME THROUGH THE RECESSIONARY PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN THERE WAS A REDUCTION? IN THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO THE COMMISSION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY -- I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THERE'S NOTHING NEFARIOUS GOING ON WITH THE FOUNDATION. FOR THE COMMISSION. THIS IS A ORGANIZATION THAT DOES ALL OF ITS BUSINESS. IN PUBLIC. IS THERE OPPOSITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE OVER THE YEARS -- AN EXAMPLE BEING THE MALIBU LAGOON PROJECT THAT YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH YES IN FACT THERE HAS BEEN OPPOSITION TO IT. NOT UNLIKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S OPPOSITION TO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING THAT'S PROPOSED AND THAT'S HEALTHY. OF OF FOR EVERYONE WHEN WE ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF DIALOGUE. BUT I THINK WITH REPECT TO THE SPECIFICS. OF THIS REPORT IS PROBABLY BEST POSITION TO DO THAT YEAH I JUST ONE TRY JUST ONE THING -- AND AND MISTER LAMB SHOULD KNOW THIS -- HE DID HE WE WENT WE WENT TO COURT AND LITIGATED -- QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THE COMMISSION STARTED AND STOPPED WHERE THE FOUNDATION STARTED AND STOPPED. AND PRIOR TO MY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. OF RUNNING THE ORGANIZATION. THERE WAS A CONFLATION OF THE COMMISSION. EVERYBODY WORKED FOR THE COMMISSION TOM I THINK IT WAS DONE LARGELY INNOCENTLY BUT FAIRLY ENOUGH THE COURT SAID HEY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE COMMISSION IS AND WHERE THE FOUNDATION IS AND YOU GUYS NEED TO CLARIFY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. YOU DON'T NEED TO JUST TALK THAT TALK ME TO WALK THAT WALK AS WELL SO WE'VE MADE ALL THOSE STEPS. TOM AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE TODAY -- SO IF WE SHINE THE LIGHT INTO PLACE WHERE IT WAS MURKY BEFORE I DON'T WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- AND IF ANYTHING YES WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE ASSETS THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE AND ASSEMBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACHIEVE OUR MISSION. IS A THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO. AND I THINK AB FIFTEEN ELEVEN IT IS A STEP IN THAT RIGHT DIRECTION THAT HELPS BRING MORE TO US CAN YOU JUST BEFORE WE CLOSE HERE OF AND I KNOW THERE'S A LONG HISTORY AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONTENTIOUSNESS ABOUT PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE. SOME OF THE ISSUES GOING ON A BY OWN -- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THE CONCERNS THE COMMUNITY THERE AS WELL AS A LAGOON. I DON'T REALLY WANT TO ADJUDICATE THOSE ISSUES HERE TODAY AND I AYE. AYE BUT I'M TRYING TO SORT OF SEPARATE. THOSE ARE ANCILLARY ISSUES FROM THE GOVERNANCE QUESTION A HAND. AND EVEN FROM THE RESOURCE. CONCERN WHICH I THINK IS LEGITIMATE AND BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T A BUDGET BILL THIS IS A POLICY BUILT. ON JUST ON THE POLICY FOR YOU CAN YOU JUST RESPOND AS HERE CLUBS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WATER SUPPLY. PURPOSE IN THE GOING NO THEY'RE NOT HERE BUT DO YOU DO YOU SEE THAT AS A AS A CAUSE FOR CONCERN EXPANDING INTO WATER SUPPLY WAS IF THAT AQUIFER RECHARGE. ISSUE UNDERLYING I JUST WANT TO FIND SOME WAY IF WE OULD EVEN IF WE NEED TO REFINE THAT OR MAKE THAT EXTRA CLEAR THAT THIS IS IN. SOME OTHER. AGAIN SOME OTHER STALKING HORSE FOR SOME OTHER PROJECT AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE IT WILL REACH HE HAD NO SAID THAT THE DAILY I CAN I CAN SUGGEST -- IS I'VE HAD NO CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYONE THAT PUTS US INTO THE WATER MANAGEMENT -- ARENA -- WE'RE NOT UNDERTAKING REGULATIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BECOME A WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CONTRIBUTE. TO THE MANY PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE IN THE LA BASIN TO PROJECTS THAT PRIORITIZE. INCREASING WATER ABUNDANCE FOR FUTURE WATER SUPPLY TIME MOST THE TIME THOSE GO HAND IN GLOVE WITH WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE WAY THAT WE WORK IN A BUILT AN UNBUILT ENVIRONMENT. I MIGHT SUGGEST THAT IT MIGHT BE WAITED A FEW SOME OF THE TENSION TO JUST CLARIFY THAT INTENT I MEAN EVEN IF YOU EVEN IF YOU RETAIN SOME OF THE THE IMPROVEMENT OF WATER SUPPLY IN THE MEASURE YOU COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY. IT SO MANY CONSIDER GOING FOR THE BUILDING WAS FOR TODAY. MAYBE THESE ARE TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE ANCILLARY ISSUES OFF THE TABLE AND SAY YEAH THE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO ESTABLISH TIS IS A WATER MANAGEMENT SUPPLY AGENCY. OR SOME OTHER WAYS TO PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCES TO THE COMMUNITY SO THEY SORT OF KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING IT IT'S REALLY IT'S ABOUT COASTAL RATHER STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. BUT IT'S NOT IS TALKING OR FOR SOME OTHER -- OF SOME OTHER SO I I DON'T KNOW IF THE AUDIO. I'M I'M PERFECTLY OPEN TO THAT -- NOTION BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. THE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING THAT DECISION FOR THE SANTA MONICA BAY NATIONALIST WAY PROGRAM. WHICH HEAVILY INVOLVED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS INTENDED BE LOCALLY DERIVED HOUSE OF THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING THAT IS IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW TO CLARIFY. ALL THESE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE VARIOUS ENTITIES INVOLVED IS HAPPENING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO UNDERNEATH THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE THAT WE RECEIVED AS A NATIONAL ESTUARY PROGRAM. I THINK THE BILL AS AS IS AUTHORED AT SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS FOR THAT BODY TO DO ITS JOB AND DID NOT INTERVENE. UNDERSTOOD SO I'M PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D CONSIDER JUST CLARIFYING -- GOING FORWARD -- JUST TO MAKE DOUBLE SURE HERE I KNOW CENTER CABALLERO HAD A COMMENT BUT THAT I MEAN SEE WHAT WE CAN DO. OKAY -- ENTER YEAH I JUST WANTED -- TO MAKE SURE I'VE GOT THIS RIGHT. I READ THIS AND I SAW THIS IS A GOVERNANCE ISSUE AND FRANKLY -- SUPPORT THE CHANGE I THINK IT MAKES SENSE -- DOES IT AM I CORRECT THAT THE STOPPING IN THE FUNDING ISSUES ARE NOT IN THE BILL. THAT'S THAT'S NOT PART OF THE BILL AND INTO SPACE AND THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS IN REGARDS TO PASS CONTACTED SYMPTOMS EFFORTS SAY.

AND I JONES ALAN OR JUST COVER. AYE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON MONNING I'M CALLING HER I BELIEVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL THANK YOU SEMI MEMBER I UNDERSTAND AMONG ARE WAITING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THERE'S BEEN AN AGREEMENT. TO ALLOW -- MISTER MALL IN. TO GO AHEAD OF THIS COMP [inaudible] SORRY KAMLAGER-DOVE. GO AHEAD OF MR MOMENT -- SO THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE. HOLD ON A SECOND I'M SORRY I'M SORRY MR O'DONNELL. IS AHEAD OF BOTH OF YOU NOW MR MOMENTS I'M SORRY. KAMLAGER-DOVE COME ON FORWARD. AND THEY WILL COME TO YOU MISTER O'DONNELL AND THEN YOU MISTER MOMENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE APOLOGIES [inaudible] YES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU TO MISTER MALL AND ASK FOR A GREEN. I WITNESSES. ARE ON A TIMELINE I WON UNDERSTOOD THAT I TURN THIS OFF SO I CAN BE RESPECTFUL OF THE COMMITTEE. SO GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR PLACES A MORATORIUM ON THE TROPHY HUNTING. A BOBCAT. BOB CATS ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS A GAME SPECIES BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND ARE NOT PRIMARILY KILLED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. SINCE THE TRAPPING BAN WAS IMPLEMENTED BOB CAT. ONLY CAN BE CONSIDERED A TROPHY HUNTED FOR SPORT AND DISPLAYS. WITH THIS BILL THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION MAY RE OPEN THE BOBCAT HUNTING SEASON UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN. THAT USES CREDIBLE SCIENCE AN ECOSYSTEM BASED APPROACH TO INFORM DECISIONS REGARDING BOBCAT POPULATIONS INCLUDING AFFECTS ON THEIR PREY. DISEASE ABATEMENT AND BENEFITS TO FARMERS INCLUDING THE CONTROL OF INVASIVE SPECIES. FOR EXAMPLE BOBCATS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CONTROL OF RODENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING INVASIVE NUTRIA WHICH ARE SPREADING AND CAUSING EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES. THE MORATORIUM ALLOWS FOR COMMONSENSE EXEMPTIONS TO PROTECT HUMAN SAFETY PUBLIC PROPERTY. AND LIVESTOCK. THE STATE WIDE THE LAST STATEWIDE BOBCAT POPULATION ASSESSMENT IS MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD AND IS WHOLLY OUTDATED. AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. RATHER THAN ON AND RELIABLE DATA SOURCES INCLUDING SELF REPORTING. AND SELF REPORTED HUNTER SURVEYS WITHOUT CREDIBLE SCIENCE WE CANNOT INSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR WILD CATS. TWO WEEKS AGO ON JUNE TWENTY FIFTH THE LA TIMES REPORTED THAT RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES SUGGEST AN ALMOST ONE IN FOUR CHANCE THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LIONS. COULD BECOME EXTINCT IN THE SANTA MONICA AND SANTA ANA MOUNTAINS WITH IN FIFTY YEARS WE MUST ENSURE THAT BOBCATS A SIMILAR SPECIES ARE NOT DESTINED FOR A SIMILAR FATE. CALIFORNIA'S WILD CATS ARE MUCH MORE VALUABLE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS ALIVE THAN DEAD. YOUR WITH ME TO TESTIFY AS WINDY KEEP OVER A SENIOR CARNIVORE SPECIALIST WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. AND DOCTOR JEAN TRAP FROM CSU SACRAMENTO WHO IS A RETIRED PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY APPRECIATED COMMITTEE -- YES WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON ON AB -- TWELVE FIFTY FOUR ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POLL THAT REMINGTON DID OF CALIFORNIANS BOBCATS AND 75% WOULD VALUE SEEING ONE IN THE WILD. BOBCATS RARELY OCCUR. WHEN SOMEONE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VIEW THEM SUCH AS THAT -- POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE THEY CAN CONTRIBUTED IMMENSELY TO LOCAL ECONOMIES -- IN A WILDLIFE WATCHING TOURISM. BUT BY ALLOWING ONE PERSON TO KILL THAT ANIMAL IT TAKES OPPORTUNITY AWAY FROM US DOZENS OF OTHERS TO PHOTOGRAPH OR TO VIEW IT. BOB CATS ARE PRIMARILY HUNTED FOR THEIR BODY PARTS TROPHY HUNTERS TAKE WILD CATS IN RENDERED THEM OR THEIR PARTS INTO TROPHIES STATE POSE WITH THE CARCASSES AND FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. LIKE MOUNTAIN LIONS WHO WERE BANNED FOR SPORT HUNTING STARTING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. THEY ARE NOT PRIMARILY HUNTED FOR FOOD. ANY BIOLOGISTS HAVE NOTED THAT. TROPHY HUNTING BOBCATS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE WAY TO INTERACT WITH ANIMALS WHO HAVE SOPHISTICATED LEVELS OF INTELLIGENCE THE MOTION AND SOCIOLOGY. WHICH IS PROFOUNDLY DISRUPTED BY TROPHY HUNTING -- BOBCATS HAVE A LOT OF IMPORTANT INTRINSIC VALUES -- THEY REDUCE RODENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING NUTRIA COULD DAMAGE -- NOT ONLY CROPS BUT WETLANDS -- WE ANALYZE USDA DATA -- AND LOOKING AT LIVESTOCK LOSSES IN IN CALIFORNIA BOBCATS KILLED NEW. CATTLE OR SHEEP FROM THE FROM THE LAST -- AND DATA REPORTS FROM USDA AND DATA FROM. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE SHOW THAT CONFLICTS WITH CHICKENS AND RABBITS ARE EXTREMELY RARE. SO -- YET THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR COMMONSENSE EXEMPTIONS FOR RANCHERS TO KILL BOBCATS TO PROTECT THEIR LIVESTOCK AND PROPERTY -- SO IT DOESN'T BàN BOBCAT HUNTING INTO PERPETUITY AT MARLEY PAZ'S BOBCAT HUNTING UNTIL THE STATE CAN UPDATE IT'S THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD MANAGEMENT PLAN. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOU TO PASS THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- AND FOR YOUR EXPERTISE ON THIS MATTER -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] WELCOME SIR [inaudible] GREETINGS -- MY NAME IS GENE.

ANYWAY SO I THE APPOINTED WITH SOME OF THE BIOLOGY OF PREDATORS AND SO ON THERE IS THERE IS NO GOOD DATA SET FOR MANAGING BOBCATS IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S BEEN STUDIES -- BACK. THE COURSE OF THAT WERE KIND OF PILOT STUDIES THEY'REBOTH IN THE DESERT ONE WAS DOWN THE MOHAVE DESERT WENT UP IN NORTHEASTERN SAGEBRUSH DESERT. I WANT YOU LEARN THERE WHAT THE WHAT THE RESEARCHERS SAID. APPLIES OVER THERE TO THE DESERT OKAY. NOT TO THE REST OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S A LOT OF CALIFORNIA LEFTOVER SO -- FISH FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT HAS TO HAVE SOME BY HER HOUSE. A NUMBER OF STUDIES SPREAD AROUND THE STATE. TO GET DATA ON BOBCAT POPULATIONS SEX RATIOS. MANY YOUNG HOW MANY OLD INSTANT WHAT'S IMMORTALITY RATE. SUCH AS THAT. AND SO WE REALLY NEED. A FISHING GAME TO FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE -- AT THE STATE. TO COME UP WITH A GOOD MANAGEMENT PLANTS WE CAN HANDLE BOBCATS THE STATE IN A RATIONAL WAY. THIS IS NO -- THERE'S NO GOOD REASON TO HUNT BOB YES JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF KILLING THEM AND BRAGGING ABOUT THE SKIN SO YOU. HANG UP ON YOUR WALL -- I AGREE THANK YOU SIR. THE TESTIMONY WE COMEBACK TO YOU IF WE HAVE ANY OTHER NEEDS FOR FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS OF OKAY OKAY I JUST AND THEN WE'LL WORK ON ONE AND HAVE A MORE WORDS. YEAH JUST -- ABOUT CATS AND RATHER SLOW REPRODUCTIVE RATE. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST ONCE YOU'RE CENTER AND THIS EVERY TWO YEARS IT MIGHT BREED. THE USUALLY HAVE THREE KITTENS AS FAR AS PREDATORS GOING GENERAL. GENERAL EVEN BOBCATS MOST OF THE YOUNG DIE IN THE FIRST YEAR. THANK YOU FOR THAT -- WE'VE OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. YEAH PLEASE COME FOR JUST A A NAME AND AFFILIATION IN YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL.

PHIL BUT WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO PROCEED IN YES. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL GAINES CITY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION AND THE WHILE SHE FOUNDATION AND ELEVEN OTHER. WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS. IN OPPOSITION THIS AB. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR FIRST OF ALL THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED BY THIS CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE YEARS AGO SPECIFICALLY. TO DEFINE AND DETERMINE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. THE FIVE MEMBER PANEL ALL APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE. ALL FIVE MEMBERS RIGHT NOW WERE APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. FISHING GAME PROCESS FISH AND GAME COMMISSION PROCESS IS VERY THOROUGH TO THREE MEANING PROCESS YOU HAVE AN INITIAL MEETING WHICH WHERE THE ISSUE WAS NOTICED. THEY TAKE FULL PUBLIC TESTIMONY THERE TAKE INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THERE AS WELL SECOND MEETING IS JUST A DISCUSSION HEARING. FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY THERE AS WELL NO ME TOO IS I MEAN THEY'LL GIVE YOU UP TO A MINUTE SOMETIMES UP TO THREE MINUTES BUT NO LESS THAN A MINUTE. IN THE THIRD HEARING WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ADOPTION HEARING. AGAIN FULL TESTIMONY INPUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT. IN FULL PUBLIC TESTIMONY THERE AS WELL. IT'S ALSO WRAPPED IN SCIENCE AN APARTMENT A FISH AND WILDLIFE BRINGS THEIR SCIENCE TO THE TABLE AS TO VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC RING THEIR SCIENCE TO THE TABLE AS WELL ALL OF THAT IS FULLY CONSIDERED. BEFORE THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION MAKES A DECISION. SPEAKING OF SCIENCE IT ALSO REQUIRES CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT. FORMED IN THAT THAT BE TAKEN CARE OF AND PUT INTO THE SYSTEM BEFORE THEY CAN RENDER A DECISION ON THAT SO IT'S FULLY WRAPPED IN SCIENCE. WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT AB TWELVE FIFTY FOUR WILL HARM BOBCATS MORE THAN HURTING? NOBODY HATES POACHERS MORE THAN LAW ABIDING HUNTRS. TO THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT. BOB MINING HUNDREDS WHEN THEY'RE OUT IN THE FIELD PURSUING BOBCATS OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE ALSO ARE THE EYES IN THE YEARS OF THE DEPARTMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO TO FINDING AND REPORTING TO CALTECH ANOTHER MEANS POACHERS THAT ARE OUT IN THE FIELD? IF YOU OUTLAWED THE HUNTING OF BOBCATS FOR FIVE YEARS IT'LL TAKE THOSE LAW ABIDING HUNTERS IN THE EYES NEAR THEY PROVIDE. OUT OF THE FIELD AND MAKE THEM NO LONGER A BENEFIT TO FISHING GAME ENFORCEMENT. FURTHER IF YOU TAKE HUNTERS OUT OF THE FIELD FOR THOSE FIVE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT'S DATA IS GOING TO SUFFER AS WELL IN ORDER TO TO HARVEST A BOBCAT IN CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BOBCAT TAX IN WHEN YOU DO HARVEST ONE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO REPORT WHERE WOMEN AND HOW THAT BOBCAT WAS TAKEN. THAT DATA PROVIDES INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME WHEN THEY'RE MAKING DECISIONS WORKING WITH THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. BUT BOBCAT REGULATIONS. GORDON SAYS HE TO WRAP IT UP IN A SEC HERE SIR SO. HE ONE FINAL COMMENT ONE FINAL COMMENT ON THE MANAGEMENT PLAN THIS BILL IS YOU KNOW. DOES REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE PERFORM A MANAGEMENT PLAN ON BOBCATS TECHNICALLY THAT SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE. THE THE HUNTING OF BOBCATS IS PROHIBITED NOT DURING OR AFTER. IN THE DATA IN THAT MANAGEMENT PLAN WHEN THEY'RE PUTTING A PLAN TOGETHER IF THEY'RE DOING IT ON BOBCATS THERE'S THOUSANDS OF OTHER SPECIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S LIMITED STAFF. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM RESEARCH ON THAT ARGUABLY ARE MUCH MORE CRITICAL NEED THE BOBCATS IT'S BECAUSE OF ALL THESE REASONS THAT WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON AB. TWELVE FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION. WE SEE THIS BILL IS BEING -- A PURELY AN ANTI HUNTING MEASURE THAT IS NOT BASED IN SCIENCE OR SOUND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES. BOBCATS ARE VERY ABUNDANT THEY'RE FOUND IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTY OF CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR FOUND THROUGHOUT MOST STATES. ALL THE WAY UP INTO ALSO CANADA DOWN INTO MEXICO. THEY'RE BY NO MEANS RARE -- HONEYMOON WHICH IS HIGHLY REGULATED AS YOU KNOW. NBA BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENE HAS LITTLE IF ANY IMPACT ON THIS PC. AN EXAMPLE -- IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BOB DURING THAT BOBCAT HUNTING SEASON. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE -- SOLD ALMOST TWELVE THOUSAND BOBCAT TAGS BUT ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE ANIMALS WERE HARVESTED SO THAT'S MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE OVERALL POPULATION -- WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THAT BOBCATS ARE TROPHIES VC WE WOULD DOUBT RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THAT WE HAVE TROPHY PROVISIONS WHICH ARE IN OUR FISHING GAME CODE THAT RELATE TO DEER. ELK ANTELOPE THOSE TYPES OF CRITTERS NO WE'RE IN THERE ARE BOB CHECK BOBCATS CONSIDER TROPHY SPECIES SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT -- ARE REAL FEAR IS THAT IF YOU PASS THIS TODAY WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEXT IN IS IT GONNA BE BEARS NEXT YEAR -- HI OATS WATERFOWL WHO KNOWS WHERE THIS WALL LEAD. AND WAS TOUCHED ON EARLIER YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU. BELIEVE OR NOT AND HUNTING -- I I RESPECT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THAT IT COULD BE AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE. BUT WE ALL SHOULD BE AGREEING THAT THE PROPER WAY TO MAKE THESE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IS BEFORE FISHING GAME COMMISSION. THEY HAVE THE SCIENCE THE OF THE BIOLOGY THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT LET THEM DO THEIR JOB AND WE'LL GET THIS THING RIGHT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT HAS MY THANK YOU I'M TO THE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION IS DETERMINED AURORA GRIFFITHS BECOME HEALTHY CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION BECAUSE BRIEFLY EXPAND ON THE RETIRED GAME MORTON. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF DOING THAT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID AS A 100% ACCURATE EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A LAWFUL MEMBER OUT OF THE FIELD. THOSE EYES ARE LOST TO THAT AS A TOOL TO THE GAME WORDS TO TO REPORT OTHER ACTIVITY. SECONDLY REAL QUICK AS THE ARE THREE MOVE IN CALIFORNIA THE TO RECRUIT NEW HUNTERS. WERE TAKEN AWAY YET ANOTHER THING THAT. GETS PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD GETS PEOPLE MOTIVATED. CALIFORNIA HUNDRED NUMBERS A DECLINE FROM OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND THE SEVENTIES TO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TODAY. TENNIS OF STRONG MOVEMENT RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR BROWN CALLED FOR A COUPLE YEARS AGO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE NEXT GENERATION CALIFORNIA'S FOR SOME CONSERVATION IS IN THIS. BILL FLIES TO FACE THAT THANK YOU SIR THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIRMAN CAPPING WINTER PRISON SPARK CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS FANS COALITION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION ON OPPOSITION I WOULD JUST. STATE ONE ONE THING -- LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET YOU ALL PUT FOR WORD A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO KIND OF REORGANIZE ITSELF LOOK AT WHERE IT'S THE MONEY IS GOING LOOK AT WHERE THE PROGRAM SHOULD GO. IT'S A THREE YEAR PROCESS AND WE SHOULD LET THAT PROCESS WORK THANK YOU THANK YOU AIMS BUNCH YES. RESEARCHER -- NO OTHER MEMBERS. MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GUIDES AND SPORTSMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS BEST HANDLED BY. THE APPOINTED BODY THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SEEN NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- WILL BRING IT BACK TO AN EMPTY DíAS. AND ME. BUT IS THERE YEAH. YOU WANT. TO SEEM LIKE THEY WERE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES ONE IS TIMING OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND HI SIR. IT FELT A LITTLE MORE LIKE A RESOURCES BUDGET QUESTION AND ONE AND THEN THE OTHER WAS ABOUT THEN YOU FOR DECISION MAKING. LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE A QUICK COMMENT ON I WILL -- TRY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE THINGS AND THEN I WILL ALLOW A WINDY -- TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OTHERS AND I'LL TRY TO BE AS SUCCINCT AS POSSIBLE -- YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT IS NOT A TROPHY ANIMAL BUT NO ONE IS EATING THE BOBCATS SO I MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW WHAT ELSE TO DEFINE IT OTHER I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S KILLING FOR VANITY BUT THEY'RE NOT. EATING THEM AND SO THE QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW MORALLY THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHY -- THEY WOULD NEED TO BE -- SHOT THE OTHER ISSUE IS I KNOW PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE SETS A BAD PRECEDENT BUT I'M TO MY KNOWLEDGE IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THE ONLY HUNTING BAN -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN ACTED AS BEEN A BAN ON MOUNTAIN LION SO I DO THINK YOU KNOW WHERE THIRTY YEAR TIME SPAN DOES SUGGEST THAT WERE BEING INCREDIBLY JUDICIOUS. ABOUT THE BANDS THAT WERE PLACING WE DO AGREE -- THAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE HIGHLY INVOLVED IN FACT -- IN IT WAS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMISSION -- STAFF THAT WE SUPPORTED I MAINTENANCE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS IT RELATES TO THE MANAGEMENT PLAN -- THEY IT IS REALLY SORT OF UP -- TO THE COMMISSION TO DECIDE. HOW QUICKLY THEY WANT TO DO THEIR STUDY IN THE QUICKER THEY DO THE STUDY THE QUICKER THE BAN IS LIFTED -- BUT THIS CERTAINLY DOES SORT OF PUT A PAUSE ON THOSE KINDS OF KILLINGS OF OF BOBCATS AND AND WILD CATS WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WAIT. FOR A SPECIES TO BE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION BEFORE WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING THEM -- AND THAT ISSUE BEFORE INTERRUPT YOU. THE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED IT. I AM IN TERMS O THE BOBCAT MANAGEMENT PLAN USE INCREDIBLE CREDIBLE SCIENCE AND WE ACCEPT. OKAY SO SO THAT IS IN THERE AND HOPEFULLY THAT DOES PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CERTAINTY TO THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE BEING INTEGRATED INTO THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD. BROWN UTILIZING ECOSYSTEM BASED APPROACH -- DID YOU HAVE FURTHER COMMENT. THE RESPONSE ON AND JUST ONE POINT THAT AND YOU AND THEN TIMING -- YEAH. TO ONE POINT THE THE COMMISSION HAS HAD THIRTY FIVE YEARS TO GET IT RIGHT AND THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT YET SO -- DOES THIS GIVES THEM. AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT YEAH. WE'VE GOT NO THEY HAVE NO SCIENTIFIC DATA ON BOBCAT POPULATIONS. CALIFORNIA. NINE ZERO OKAY SO -- VERY GOOD -- I I SEE YOUR OTHER WITNESS HAS A HAS ONE MORE PIECE OF INFORMATION. IT'S YOU'VE COME ALL THIS WAY YOU WANT TO TAKE THIRTY SECONDS HERE AND MAKE ONE MORE PIECE TO TELL YOU CAN YOU CAN COME RIGHT UP TO THE MIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THEIR GO. GO RIGHT AHEAD AND THEN WE WILL WRAP UP HERE -- GO TO THE OTHER. I'M GONNA RECOMMEND. YEAH. ALTHOUGH MISTER O'CONNOR. NO IT'S OKAY. BOB BOBCATS ARE IN NO WAY A BUNDLE. THE BOB CANCELED HAVE HOME RANGES WHERE THEY HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES. AND TERRITORIES OR MALES DEFEND AGAINST OTHER MALES FEMALES DEFEND AGAINST OTHER FEMALES IN THEIR TERRITORIES IN THESE ARE HOME RANGES INCLUDING ALL THE RESOURCES. THE HOME RANGE. OF A RANGE OF HOME RANGE SIZES ARE SOMETHING LIKE ONE SQUARE MILE. TWO UP TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OR MORE PER BOBCAT. AND I I I'VE BEEN A BIOLOGIST IN ANIMAL. PERSONAGES TO FOR MY WHOLE LIFE AND I'VE BEEN OUT IN THE FIELD THAT HAD A LOT OF STUDENTS DOING RESEARCH ON MAMMALS. I'VE SEEN. THREE BOBCATS IN MY LIFE. THANK YOU SIR -- I DO SEE A RESPONSE FROM THE COALITION BUT I'M JUST I'M. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER MEMBERS UP HERE [inaudible] HI. WELL I A IT WILL WRAP IS THE THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT THEY'RE FOUND IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA OTHER THAN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY. AND THEN WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER REGARDING. PROP ONE SEVENTEEN THAT WAS AN INITIATIVE PASSED BY THE VOTERS THAT WAS NOT THE LEGISLATURE BANNING THIS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION FOR THE RECORD -- SEPTEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH. INVESTIGATION THE ISSUES THERE AREN'T ANY MOTIONS AVAILABLE THIS TIME WHICH ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AND LEAVE THE MEASURE ON CALL. TO SEE IF. THANK YOU I JUST I WON I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING THIS BILL TO BE HEARD AND ALSO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN FOR LETTING ME AM TO TAKE HIS SPACE I JUST -- YOU KNOW ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AFTER WE VOTED ON IT MY COLLEAGUE CAME UP TO ME AND SAID. I AM A NATIVE AMERICAN IN IN MY CULTURE I AM PART OF THE COYOTE CLAN. AND WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM MARRYING OR LOVING ANY OTHER PERSON WHO WAS UNLESS THEY ARE FROM THE WILD CAT PLAN. HE SAID IN SO IT IS BECAUSE OF MY CULTURE THAT I HAD TO VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE IF I VOTED AGAINST IT. I WOULD ACTUALLY BE VOTING TO KILL. OTHER CLAN MEMBERS THAT ARE PART OF MY INDIGENOUS CULTURE SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET. THERE'S ALSO A SPIRITUAL COMPONENT OF THIS BILL THAT EVEN I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE AND SOMEONE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE MANAGING THE ECO SYSTEM IN THE BIO DIVERSITY OF THE STATE I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THOSE OTHER SORT OF CULTURAL -- RELEVANT SEES INTO -- CONSIDERATION WHEN WE ARE VOTING ON A MEASURE LIKE THIS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION BELIEVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL -- AND KEEP HIS HEARING MOVING. SO MR MULLIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. AND YOUR DIFFERENCE -- WE HAVE. ITEM THIRTEEN THAT'S A. B. NINE TWO NOPE AB. EIGHT TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SEA LEVEL RISE IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS YOU KNOW. SAN MATTEO COUNTY AS MORE PEOPLE AND PROPERTY VALUE AT RISK FROM RISING SEA LEVELS THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE STATE. MANY EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE THREAT OF SEA LEVEL RISE FLOODING IN COASTAL EROSION ARE ALREADY WELL UNDER WAY. SEVENTY OF COUNTY TWENTY CITIES NEED COORDINATED APPROACH TO ADEQUATELY PREPARE FOR THESE THREATS ACROSS THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE. AB EIGHT TWENTY FIVE WOULD MODIFY THE EXISTING SAN MATEO COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. AND RENAME IT THE FLOOD AND SEA LEVEL RISE RESILIENCY AGENCY THE AGENCY LIKE THE EXISTING HAVE CD WOULD BE A COUNTY WIDE SPECIAL DISTRICT. THIS MODIFIED ENTITY WOULD BE TASKED WITH SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING FLOODING. COASTAL EROSION SEA LEVEL RISE TO BEST PROTECT AND PREPARE THE COUNTIES COMMUNITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE THIS IS A COORDINATED IN PROACTIVE APPROACH FOR THE COUNTIES -- FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN SAN MATEO COUNTY AND WITH ME TODAY IS STEVE KERR'S ON BEHALF OF SAN MATEO COUNTY TO OFFER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR WELCOME YES GOOD AFTERNOON -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SPEAKERS ON BEHALF OF SENATOR COUNTY -- FIRST OF ALL THANK SEPTEMBER MULLIN FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL AND HE COVERED THE ESSENCE OF IT I WOULD.

NINE TWENTY SIX FIRST. I NINE YES MA'AM OKAY OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB NINE TWENTY SIX WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE CAP ON THE OIL TRUST FUND AND HELP ENSURE THE CLEANUP. OF THE VAN AND WELL SO MY DISTRICT THAT'S WHAT THE LONG BEACH AREA. THE LONG BEACH THAILAND'S ARE AND AND THE OUR HOME TO THE WILMINGTON OIL FIELD ONE OF THE LARGEST OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS IN THE COUNTRY. THE FEEL PRODUCES APPROXIMATELY FORTY SIX THOUSAND BARRELS FROM OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACTIVE WORLDS EACH DAY. BECAUSE THESE OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED ON STATE LANDS ENTRUSTED TO THE CITY OF LONG BEACH THE STATE RECEIVES A SHARE OF THE NET PROFITS FROM THESE OPERATIONS. HOWEVER THESE WELLS WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. AND CURRENT PROJECTIONS ESTIMATE THAT OIL OPERATIONS WILL CEASE TO TO PRODUCE AROUND THE YEAR. TWENTY THIRTY SIX TO ENSURE THE STATE HAS THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO DECOMMISSION THE WELLS. AND MITIGATE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENT AND MIDDLE IMPACTS THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE OIL TRUST FUND IN. TWO THOUSAND FIVE A PORTION OF THE STATE'S SHARE OF NET PROFITS BEGAN GOING INTO THE FUN. WITH THE INTENT OF COVERING THE EVENTUAL DECOMMISSIONING COSTS OF THE OPERATIONS. AT THE TIME OF THE FUND'S CREATION. CAP OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS PLACED ON THE FUN BASED ON THE ON THE PREMISE THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE MORE MONEY THAT IS NECESSARY. TO OFFICIALLY CLOSING CLEAN UP THOSE WELLS YOU DON'T JUST TURN WELL OFF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO FILL IT UP WITH CEMENT INTO A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS TO ENSURE. A LONG TERM SAFETY OF THAT WILL ALSO THAT OIL DOESN'T COME OUT AGAIN. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN OIL TRUSTS AND REACH THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CAP ESTIMATES PLACE THE STATE'S EVENTUAL COST FOR CLEANING UP THE WORLD'S AT EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THIS REALLY THE STATE WITH THE SHORTFALL OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL LIKELY HAVE TO COME OUT OF OUR STAGE GENERAL FUND. SO WE SEEK TO DO SIMPLY TODAY IS TO ADD MORE MONEY TO THAT FUND SO THAT WE CAN EVENTUALLY CLEAN UP THOSE OIL WELLS. AND WITH ME HERE TODAY ON BEHALF THE CITY LONG BEACH IS -- IS A MEMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AMY BROWN ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH WE THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR RUNNING THIS BILL LIFTING THE CAP OBVIOUSLY WILL BENEFIT THE CITY AND OUR PARTNER THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION.

SIXTEEN NINETY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANKING HIM THE STUFF FOR THEIR FINE WORK ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB SIXTEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH WILL EXPAND THE TERRITORY OF THE SAN GABRIEL AND LOWER RIVERS MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY TO INCLUDE THE DIMMING IS CHANNEL WATERSHED. IN CATALINA ISLAND. THIS IS A STATUS FOR TWENTY YEARS AGO THE RIVERS ND MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY HAS SUCCESSFULLY PURSUED A MISSION OF PRESERVING OPEN SPACE. AND HABITAT WELL FACILITATING PUBLIC ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA'S WILDERNESS AND WILDLIFE. BY PROVIDING GRANTS TO VARIOUS PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY IN THE EASTERN LOS ANGELES WESTERN ORANGE COUNTY'S. THE CONSERVANCY HAS IMPROVED WATERSHED. RESTORE WILDLIFE HABITAT CAM PROVIDED NUMEROUS OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL AN ASIAN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. WELL THE CONSERVANCY HAS AS GREAT TO HAS FOUND GREAT SUCCESS WITH NUMEROUS PROJECTS WITHIN ITS TERRITORY. SEVERAL NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT HAD. THE SAME ADVANTAGE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. THE NEW MINGUS CHANNEL WATERSHED LOCATED. TO THE EAST OF LOS ANGELES ANGELS RIVER IS ONE AREA WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITIES IN NEED. INCLUDING PORTIONS OF INGLEWOOD CARSON TORRANCE SAMPEDRO AND SEVERAL OTHER COMMUNITIES THE TO MAKE THIS WATER SHOP. IS HEAVILY DEVELOPED. IN SEVERELY LACKING AND PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE OPEN SPACE. AND OTHER NEARBY AREA OF LAND IS CATALINA ISLAND WHICH TO I REPRESENT. WELL NOT IN NEED OF MORE OPEN SPACE ACCESS TO THAT OPEN SPACE CAN PROVE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. ADDITIONALLY THE ISLANDS DEPENDENCE ON THE VOLATILE TOURISM MINISTRY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SECURE CONSISTENT LONG TERM FUNDING FOR OPEN SPACE OR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THE SAN DIEGO RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY AS HE IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO HELP THESE AREAS EXPAND THEIR MISSION OF PRESERVING CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL RESOURCE. IN A WAY WE ALL CAN ENJOY AB SIXTEEN NINETY FOUR WILL ALL THEM TO IDENTIFY TO I'M TO DO EXACTLY THAT BY EXPANDING THEIR TERRITORY.

TO THE PORT OF LONG BEACH ADDITION OF SENATE CLEAN CATALINA ISLAND AND THE MINGUS -- CHANNEL WATERSHED SHARE MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LAND WITHIN THE EXISTING CONSERVANCY BOUNDARIES. NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS. IN VERY HIGH NEED WITH AND MANY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES PARK FOR COMMUNITIES. ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE CONSERVANCY CURRENTLY PROVIDES RESOURCES TO WILL WE THAT -- THE MAKERS CHANNEL END SENDING CATALINA ISLAND. THE INCLUSION OF SANTA QUE. CATALINA IN THE DIMMING AS-WATERSHED REPRESENT LESS THAN A OF THE CONSERVANCY WHICH IS OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. THIS PROPOSAL TAKES IN INGLEWOOD. AREA DEFINEDBY LAW STANDPOINT. EIGHT PARKS. FOR FOR ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF CARSON WITH. ONE POINT FIVE ACRES PER ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HARBOR GATEWAY COMMUNITIES WITH LESS THAN POINT. FOUR ACRES FOR ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE SO SEVERELY PARK -- FOR COMMUNITIES WITHIN THIS EXPANSION AREA. YEAH FOR CATALINA THE CALORIE CATALINA ISLAND CONSERVANCY IN THE CITY OF AVALON. PLANS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSERVANCY IN ITS EFFORTS TO CONSERVE EDUCATE AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW IMPACT RECREATION. IN THE TIMING OF THIS SECTION APPEARS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE ARM C. WAS FORMED. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO BY SB. TWO SIXTEEN IT IS DUE FOR ITS UPDATE OF THE OPEN SPACE PLAN. WE WILL BE ABLE TO INCLUDE CATELYN AT THE BIGGEST CHANNEL. YEAH THOSE UPDATES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO WE LOOK FORWARD. TO MOVING AHEAD THIS THANK YOU. FOR OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

FOR YEARS WATERSHEDS OCCUPY A VARIETY OF UNIQUE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS INCLUDING URBAN AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTED LANDS CHANNELING RAIN FALLING SNOW MELT TO CREEKS STREAMS AND RIVERS AND EVENTUALLY THÅU FLOW POINT SUCH AS RESERVOIRS. DAYS AND THE OCEAN. DESPITE THEIR PIVOTAL ROLE IN ENSURING HEALTHY ECOSYSTEMS FUNDING FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S WATERSHED. HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT IN RECENT YEARS -- ACTIVE MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE HEALTHY WATERSHEDS WATERSHED COORDINATORS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE HERE DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING WATERSHED IMPROVEMENT PLANS.

FROM MY EXPERIENCE WATERSHED COORDINATORS HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND IMPLEMENTING WATERSHED MANAGEMENT EFFORTS GIVEN BY CONCERNS ABOUT LOCAL AND REGIONAL ISSUES. WATERSHED COORDINATORS PROVIDE A BASIS FOR CONTINUAL MANAGEMENT AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT WATER SAID PLANS AND PROGRAMS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND THE LINE WAS STATE WIDE AND REGIONAL OBJECTIVES. EFFECTIVE WATERSHED MANAGEMENT EFFORTS ARE BUILT UPON A STRONG FOUNDATION OF ADEQUATE RESOURCES TECHNICAL TOOLS AND COOPERATION. WATERSHED COORDINATORS ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SERVICE THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR LANDOWNERS ORGANIZATIONS AGENCIES AND POLICY MAKERS TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND SUPPORT. AND LEVERAGE FUNDING AND RESOURCES.

NOW WE JUST HANG OUT FOR A MINUTE YEAH RIGHT YEAH THAT YEAH COM AND ALL RIGHT THIRD DEFERENTIAL MOVE FROM SOME MEMBER LEVINE APPRECIATE IT ASSEMBLYMEMBER WERNER **** BATH. WELCOME I THINK YOU ONLY HAVE ONE ITEM UP BEFORE US TODAY AB -- SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE SO PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON WHILE PEEING CAM THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE SENATORS WATCHING. OFFICES -- TODAY IT'S AN HONOR TO PRESENT AB MY BILL AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WHICH A PROPERLY REGULATE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS. AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES COASTAL ZONE AS A THREE YEAR PILOT. WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A STATEWIDE HOUSING CRISIS. ARE YOU ALL KNOW THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN REGULATE OR BAN SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AS THEY SEE FIT. EXCEPT IN THE COASTAL ZONE. AND THE CLOSE IS ON THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION HAS THE ABILITY TO REGULATE LAND USE BUT NOT ONLY IS APPLIES TO COAST BUT ONLY AS IT APPLIES TO COASTAL ACCESS. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BALANCE COASTAL ACCESS WITH HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION REQUIRE CITIES TO HAVE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR AFFORDABILITY EVEN IN COUNTIES THAT DO AN EXCELLENT JOB IN PROVIDING LOW COST COASTAL CONDITIONS LIKE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SAN DIEGO COUNTY ACCOUNTS FOR NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE STATE. WITH ABOUT ONE PER ONE THOUSAND PER COUNTY RESIDENTS. TRANSLATED THAT MEANS THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE DO NOT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH LOW COST COAST ACCOMMODATIONS ARE COASTAL ACCESS. BUT WE DO HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IS EXACERBATED BY THE PROLIFERATION OF SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS WHICH ARE REMOVING HOUSING FROM OUR HOUSING STOCK ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE POPULARITY IN EASE. THROUGH WHICH SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS MAKE IT EASY TO RENT OUT OUT UNITS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IN ISSUE. WHEN ANY VIRTUALLY INCENTIVIZE AS FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS OVER LONG TERM RENTS? IN ADDITION A RENT A RECENT SIR A STUDY THAT CAME OUT JUST READ RESPONDING TO THE NOW SAYS FROM UCLA AND A RESEARCHER FROM USC. SO THAT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASE IN AIRBNB RENTALS FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS RENT DOES GO UP. AND THAT EFFECT IS EXACERBATED WHEN YOU HAVE THESE NON OWNER OCCUPIED RENTALS LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM. CURRENTLY THERE ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY MOST OF WHICH ARE FULL TIME. WE ESTIMATE THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY CONSORTIUM. WHEN IN THE MIDST OF A STATEWIDE HOUSING CRISIS WILL WE ALLOW FIVE THOUSAND UNITS TO BE DEMOLISHED AND NOT REPLACE? AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATIONAL SURVEY OF AIRBNB IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY 50% OF THE HOST OF MULTIPLE PROPERTIES LISTED. WHICH MEANS THESE ARE PROBABLY COMPANIES THAT ARE BUYING UP PROPERTIES AND THE RENTING THEM OUT RUNNING THEM ESSENTIALLY AS MANY HOTELS. IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE TOP POST INCENDIO COUNTY SOME OF THEM ARE BLUE WATER VACATIONS. PENNY REALITY. THESE ARE NOT FAMILIES JUST HAVING A SECOND HOME THESE ARE. INVESTORS OPERATING FULL TIME COMMERCIAL SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE NOT AVAILABLE TO BUY OR RENT LONG TERM FOR FAMILIES THING YEARS OF VETERANS OR WORKERS. IS HOUSING SUPPLY WHICH WE ALL KNOW INCREASES RENTS AND HOUSING PRICES. I REMEMBER THESE UNITS ARE COUNTED IN SENATE CITIES RENO NUMBERS FOR HOUSING NOT VISITORS SERVING USES BUT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS ARE. WELL NOT ALL THESE UNITS WILL BE AFFORDABLE THE PUSH HIGHER INCOME FOLKS DOWN THE HOUSING MARKET WHICH CAUSES THE DISPLACEMENT OF OUR FAMILIES. FIGURES VETERANS AND WORKERS. TO ADDRESSTHIS MARKET DISTORTION EIGHTY SEVENTY THIRTY ONE IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO APPROPRIATELY REGULATE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS OF THE SAN DIEGO COMIC A SYSTEM. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ALLOWS LEGITIMATE HOME SHARING WHILE PREVENTING THE REMOVAL OF HOUSING FROM THE HOUSING STOCK. DUE TO FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND MANY HOTELS. AT ITS CORE AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE SAYS THE PRIMARY RESIDENT IS ONSITE THEIR EXEMPTION FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILLS. THAT MEANS IF YOU LIVE IN YOUR EIGHTY YOU YOU CAN READ OUT YOUR FRONT HOUSE IF YOU LIVE IN A OR FRONT HOUSE YOU CAN RENT ROOMS IN YOUR HOUSE. IF YOU LIVE IN THE FRONT HOUSING COMMITTEE OUT HERE AT YOU. I AM A RESIDENT IS NOT ON SITE IN THE SHORT TERM VACATION WOULD APPLY FOR MAY BOOK THAT UNIT FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS. A YEAR WITH A MAXIMUM NINETY DAYS IF THAT. PROPERTY OWNER CHOOSES. TO A PLATFORM. THAT MEANS ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND OF THE YEAR FOR THE ENTIRE SUMMER. THAT MY FRIENDS IS LEGITIMATE HOME SHARING. AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE WAS A MINUTE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES -- TO ADD IN AN OPT OUT PROVISION BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND THIS MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF THE OPT OUT PROVISION WOULD BE BUT THERE'S A RESIDENTIAL TOURISM STONE AND SERVICE CITY CHOATE SAID WE WANT TO BE OPTED OUT OF THIS BILL. THEY CAN ZONE OR PUT IT RESIDENTIAL TOURISM OVERLY OVER THAT AREA THEY WANTED TO BE OPTED OUT. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ALLOWS OF RETURNS OF THE MUCH NEEDED TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS IS CRITICAL TO ALLOW CITIES TO OPERATE THE EMERGENCY IN TERMS OF RELATED IMPACTS SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. WHICH ARE MANY HOTELS AND HOW THE IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THIS ALSO ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COMPARE. RENTING OVER THE PLATFORMS TO WITH LOCAL PERMITTING PROCESS ONE OF THE THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE. WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR THE AFFORDABLE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL ORDINANCES. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE LAST COMMITTEE MEAN THAT THIS IS A THREE YEAR PILOT. IT WILL GET A MUCH NEEDED STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS ON THE HOUSING MARKET IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY I'M INTERESTED IN THE EFFECT OF LONG TERM RENTAL RATES AND HOUSING AVAILABILITY. TO IMPLEMENT IT REQUIRES PLATFORMS TO ADD FOR CHECK BOXES THAT WOULD CATEGORIES A UNIT IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE IS ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS BILL. IS THAT PERSON PRIMARY RESIDENT OR NOT IS IT THE PERSON LIVING ON SITE OR OFFSITE IS THAT A RENTER NOT AND IF SO DO THEY HAVE THE PERMISSION FOR THE LANDLORDS FOR THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. CITIES WILL SEE THIS RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION FROM THE TRANSIT OCCUPANCY TAX TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE FOR THEIR LOCAL POLICIES. AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE PROTECTS PROPERTY RIGHTS BUT NOT REGULARLY PROPERTY OWNERS THEY CAN STILL RENDON'S SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. UP FOR THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES AND WITHOUT THE STV ARC PLATFORMS THAT MEANS THE COMING OUT TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS BUT ASIDE FROM THEIR HOUSE THAT HAVE THEIR WEBSITE. AND OF COURSE NOTHING STOPPING THEM FROM RENTING LONG TERM FOR NINE MONTHS OR HOWEVER THEY SEE FIT. THANK YOU. THAT'S A WRAP OKAY. I SEIZE LOOKING SO EXPECTANTLY. ON THE ISSUE OF PROPERTY RIGHTS I LIKE TO POINT OUT THIS BILL DOES NOT REGULATE THE USE OF THE RESIDENTIAL HOME FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL. ONLY REGULATES HOW LONG THEY'VE EVEN MADE. BOOKS OVER THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORM. AND AS A POINT OF FACT USE OF A RESIDENTIAL HOME FOR A SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS NOT ADDRESS THE PROPERTY RIGHT. IT'S A VISITORS SERVING USE GRANTED ONLY IF ALLOWED BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION THE A PERMITTING REGISTRATION LICENSING ETCETERA IT'S NOT AUTOMATICALLY INVESTED IN THE HOMEOWNER. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE PRESERVES LOCAL CONTROL BY THE RESIDENTIAL TOURISM POPPED UP PROVISION. AT AND ALSO PRESERVES COASTAL ACCESS BE ON LOW COST BECAUSE ACCOMMODATIONS BY ALLOWING LEGITIMATE HOME SHARING WITH THE PRIMARY RESIDENT ON SITE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR OR WHEN THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OFFSITE. FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS PER PLATFORM FOR TOTAL NINETY DAYS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT BATTLE TO ADDRESS ONE PART OF THE EQUATION OF ADDRESSING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. AND THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE WITH ME. HERE TODAY IS IMPERIAL BEACH COUNCIL MEMBER MARK WEST TO SHARE A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE POSITIVE IMPACT THIS BILL WILL HAVE OUR SAN DIEGO COUNTY COUNCIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST TO CLARIFY YOU WROTE YOUR OKAY TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS. IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES YES OKAY VERY GOOD AND I I THINK THOSE WILL BE ADOPTED IF THE BILL MOVES TODAY. IN GOVERNANCE AND FINANCES THAT I SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD -- WELCOME AND JUST. YEAH PLEASE TAKE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU SOMEONE NUMBER I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU CENTER CHAIR EVERYONE. MY NAME IS MARK WES AND I AM -- COUNCILMEMBER FROM IMPERIAL BEACH IN HIS OF THE LOCALS CALL IT ID -- AND I AM HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. ONE SEVEN THREE ONE FIRST OF ALL I SHOULD MENTION THAT I AM AN ENVIRONMENTALIST I'M THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE SAN DIEGO CAP DE GOT CHAPTER SURFRIDER. THIRTEEN YEAR RESIDENT IMPERIAL BEACH RETIRED NAVAL OFFICER IN A STRONG PROPONENT AND SUPPORTER OF TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. NOW LET ME GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND ABOUT I BEACH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. WE ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES OF OUR CITY WE HAVE THREE SIDES ON WATER WITH THE TIJUANA RIVER WHICH MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY AWARE OF ON ONE SIDE. THE SAN DIEGO BAY THE OCEAN AND THEN WE HAVE THE CITY OF THE SAN DIEGO. AND ALSO WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES AND ALL THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY. BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS WE HAVE STRUGGLED FOR YEARS TO UNLOCK THE INVESTMENT OF HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY. NOT ANY HOUSING I'M TALKING ABOUT HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ALONG OUR MAIN CORRIDORS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR RESIDENTS. IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ARTS COUNCIL CAME TOGETHER. AS A COHESIVE TEAM AND TOOK A MAJOR STEP FORWARD. APPROVING OUR FIRST TEO DE WITH TWO HUNDRED UNITS UNFORTUNATELY. AS MANY DEVELOPMENTS IN COMMUNITY STATEWIDE IT WAS SHOCKING TO LEARN THE WITHIN JUST A FEW MONTHS TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED WERE IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED TO SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. I LOVE THE VISITOR SERVING USES AN IV AND THE SAN DIEGO COASTAL ZONE. WE ALL DO AS THE CHAIR OF SURFRIDER I ADVOCATED PASSIONATELY FOR BETTER ACCESS TO COASTAL ZONES THROUGHOUT ALL OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. BUT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE FIGHT THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE HAVING A HARD TIME ADDRESSING IT. AND THAT'S A CRISIS OF THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. NOW FOR US IN SAN DIEGO LIKE DECEMBER MEMBER SAID WE DO A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING. A LOW COST COMMUNITY COASTAL ACCOMMODATIONS ALMOST 30% LESS SHE MENTIONED IS WENT INSANE YOU COUNTY. AND IN FACT IN MY CITY RIGHT NOW WE'RE BUILDING MORE AFFORDABLE ACCOMMODATIONS WERE BUILDING HAMPTON IN RIGHT NOW SO WE CAN ACCOMMODATE MORE PEOPLE TO COME TO OUR COMMUNITY. BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT GOOD HARD WORKING FAMILIES CAN HAVE A PLACE TO LAY THERE HAD A NIGHT. SO WE'RE EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT THE SOMEBODY'S AUTHOR BILL AND WE WANT TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS ARE MAKING IT TOO PROFITABLE. IT TOO EASY FOR A LARGE INVESTORS TO COME INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND BY APARTMENTS AND BEACH HOUSES AND USE THEM FOR FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. COUPLE THIS WITH THE FACT THAT IT IS A GREAT INVESTMENT. IB IS REALLY SEEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND IT'S IT'S A WIN WIN FOR THOSE PEOPLE BUT NOT FOR MY COMMUNITY. THIS DOES NOT BAN OUR COMMUNITY RESIDENTS FROM DOING THIS ON THEIR OWN IT HELPS THEM IN IT WE ALLOWS MORE AT COASTAL ACCESS TO OUR COMMUNITY. IT DOES NOT ARE PETE OUR ABILITY AS A COUNCIL OR AS A PROPERTY OWNER TO RANT THANK YOU YEP. WE ARE IN A STATE RISING HAD. THE STATE WIDE HOUSING PRICES AND I URGE YOU NOT TO LOSE THIS BATTLE I WANT TO WE SUPPORT THIS AND I WON IN A LOVE TO HEAR ON A VOTE. AND I VOTE TODAY THANK YOU COUNSELOR FOR MAKING THE TRIP NORTH. FOR ALL OF AYE BE -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. VALERIE SOCCER WITH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT VERY GOOD THANK YOU MANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND COUNSELOR VEGAS ASK YOU JUST GIVE UP YOUR SEAT FOR A SECOND MAY HAVE YOU COME BACK AND THEN -- UNLESS YOU ALL YEAH IN TEXAS. SO WE'RE GONNA DO WHAT DO YOU DO TEN MINUTES EACH -- AND THEN MOVED TO OTHER OPPOSITION. THE BILL WAGNER REPRESENTING AIRBNB I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE JOAN A MECHANIC PRESIDENT OF SHARE SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS ADAM TOM'S EVENT FROM AIRBNB WHO WILL SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. OF THE NATIONAL RESOURCE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOHN MECHANIC ON THE PRESIDENT SURE SAN DIEGO WHICH IS A COALITION OF SHORT TERM. RENTAL OWNERS MANAGERS AND PROPERTY RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN SAN DIEGO. AS H THIRTY ONE DUE TO DEVASTATING EFFECT IT WILL HAVE ON OUR REGION AND LOCAL ECONOMY. FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS DEPENDENT ON SHORT TERM RENTALS ARE REGION'S RICH HISTORY OF SUPPORTING THESE LOW COST VISITOR ACCOMMODATIONS MADE OUR COMMUNITY A VIBRANT PLACE. I'M ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S TOP TOURIST DESTINATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS INCLUDING THOSE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE IMPORTANT VISIBLE VISITORS SERVING ASSET. UNFORTUNATELY AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE ATTEMPTS TO TURN BACK THE CLOCK AND MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THAT VISIT OUR COASTAL COMMUNITY EVERY YEAR. ESSENTIALLY BANNING ON HOSTED SHORT TERM RENTALS. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL ALSO BE DISASTROUS THE LIVELIHOOD OF LOCAL SAN DIEGANS CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD. THE OWNERS OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE NOT NAMELESS FACELESS CORPORATE ENTITIES THEY'RE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME. I HAVE HERE A PRINT OUT FROM THE SAN DIEGO TRANSIT OCCUPANCY DEPARTMENT APPROVES THIS EXACT POINT. EVERY PERMIT HELD AN INDIVIDUAL NAME HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN GREEN. EVERY PERMIT HELD IN A CORPORATION'S NAME HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN RED. BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE THIS TO YOU AFTERWARDS. 95% OF THE SHORT TERM RENTAL PERMITS ARE HELD IN INDIVIDUALS NAMES NOT IN CORPORATE NAMES. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED THIS INCOME TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE THEIR PROPERTY TAXES CHILDREN'S TUITIONS AND FUND THEIR RETIREMENT INCOME. THOUGH THIS BILL AS AMENDED AS A PILOT PROGRAM TO SUNSET AFTER THREE YEARS THOSE THREE THREE YEARS WOULD BE CRIPPLING TO LOCAL SAN DIEGANS. THE LIVES OF THESE PROPERTY OWNERS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY ARE NOT. AND SHOULD NEVER EVER BE TREATED LIKE A PILOT PROGRAM. PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL DEVASTATE HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES WHO RELY ON SHORT TERM RENTAL INCOME TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AS YOUR ANALYSIS MAKES CLEAR THIS BILL IS A MISGUIDED EXPERIMENT TARGETING A SMALL PIECE OF HOUSING PROBLEM WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME. AND THE THOUSANDS I AM HERE REPRESENTING RELY ON HOSTING PLATFORMS TO MAKE OUR FAMILY'S NEEDS. WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE FOR OUR REGION I RESPECTFULLY QUEST THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE VOTE NO ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. MAKE A COUPLE MORE COMMENTS. YOUR OVER TIME ALLOW YOU TO WRAP UP VERY QUICKLY FIRST AND FOREMOST ANY REALTY IN BLUE WATER REALLY TO DO NOT OWN PROPERTIES I KNOW THIS -- FACTOR MANAGEMENT COMPANIES THEY'RE NOT OWNERS OF PROPERTIES. SECONDLY BAYSIDE LANDING WHICH IS DEVELOPMENT THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IMPERIAL BEACH HAS AN H. AWAY WITH CC AND OURS IF THEY WANT TO ELIMINATE SHORT TERM RENTALS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY. BY SIMPLY CHANGING THEIR CCAR'S IN THERE IT'S A WAY TO SAY THAT NO SHORT TERM RENTALS ARE ALLOWED UNDERSTOOD OKAY THANK YOU FOR THIS POINTS THANK YOU YOU SHOULD YOU TEST MONEY SIR. YES WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMMON TODAY MY NAME SOME TALKS FOR HIS SERMON AIRBNB IS PUBLIC POLICY TEAM. UNDER THIS BILL MOSTLY CASE RENTALS WOULD BE BANNED ALONG THE ENTIRETY OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COAST. AND LOCAL RESIDENTS WISHING TO RENT OUT THEIR HOMES WHILE THEY'RE AWAY WOULD BE LIMITED TO THREE DAYS PER CALENDAR YEAR. UNLESS THEY PHYSICALLY OCCUPY THE RESIDENCE FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVEN DAYS A YEAR. A FAMILY THAT LIVES IN LOS ANGELES AND OWNS A HOME IN SAN DIEGO. THE BARD UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS BILL. USING A HOSTING POPPING LIKE AIRBNB TO RENT OUT THEIR SECOND HOME. AIRBNB WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM LISTING A PRIMARY RESIDENCE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS UNLESS WE COULD ASCERTAIN THE HOMER ACTUALLY LIVED IN THEIR HOME FOR TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS. LEAVETHAT THIS IMPOSES ON REASONABLE AND ON WORKABLE REQUIREMENTS ARE HOSTING COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE WAS SEVERELY ON UNFAIRLY ACCESS. UNFAIRLY LIMIT ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA'S COAST WHICH IS PROTECTED BY LAW. UNDER THE COASTAL ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX REALLY COOL SO OCT LOWER COSTS A BIZZARE. AND RECREATIONAL FACILITIES SHALL BE PROTECTED ENCOURAGED AND WHERE FEASIBLE PROVIDED. THE CALIFORNIA COAST COMMISSION HAS CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS INCLUDING THOSE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS OR IMPORTANT. BIZZARE SERVING ASSET AND ARE PROTECTED UNDER THE ACT. A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY BY THE UCLA FOUND THAT FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS. THE COST OF THE TRIP IS THE BIGGEST BEAR TO THE COAST. THE REPORT IDENTIFIED THAT A WAY TO COMBAT THIS ISSUE IS BY PROTECTING AND INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF LOWER COST FIGURE ACCOMMODATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD DO JUST THE OPPOSITE. SHRINKING THE SUPPLY OF LOWER COSTS ACCOMMODATIONS AND THEREBY LIMITING AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO THE COAST. ACCORDING TO PRESIDENT OF THE SAN DIEGO BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN AN INTERVIEW WITH KPBS TENURE COUNTY. AND ONE HALF THE HOUSES A USE ONE HALF THE HOUSES USED TO BUILD WHAT THE POPULATION IS INCREASING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WELL SEND YOU COUNTY HAS A SMALLER POPULATION THE BILL FIFTEEN THOUSAND IS A YEAR FOR THIRTY ONE ST YEARS UNTIL. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN A JOB TO AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN FIVE HUNDRED UNITS A YEAR. AB SEVENTY THREE ONE DOES LITTLE TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC CHALLENGES AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. INSTEAD THE BILL WILL NATIVELY IN DIRECTLY IMPACT POCKETBOOKS A MINI SANYO COUNTY RESIDENTS RELY ON SHORT TERM RENTALS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THANK YOU I JUST ASK YOU TO WRAP UP HERE YES SIR. CALIFORNIA'S COAST FROM THE CALIFORNIA'S CO SHOULD REMAIN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL. WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH LOCAL SEIZING TIES IN CRAFTING FAIR REGULATIONS AND REFLECT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF EACH COMMUNITY AND HELPING TO COLLECT TO TO REVENUE. TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE BELIEVE THE ISSUES RAISED BY THIS BILL OR PASS RESOLVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MR KERRY MEMBERS THE ONLY COVERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE RESTS ON BEHALF OF EXPEDIA GROUP IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MUCH. MANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DíAS MEMBERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS ETCETERA. I'M Y. LOVE IF WE DO HAVE. FOLKS FROM BOTH SIDES HERE BECAUSE I I SO. ON THE LAST COMMENT THAT WAS MADE. ONE OF THE LAST COUNT WAS MADE IN INCOME AND IT WAS MADE ME WHEN I WAS. MEETING WITH THE OPPOSITION. WAS IT THIS IS BEST IS ALL THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AYE AYE. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT I I I TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN. A KIND OF AN ATTEMPT HERE. TO PUSH BACK ON SOME STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION. YES MY YOU MIGHT MY BROADER SENSE HERE IS THAT TO THE EXTENT THE BILL. HI I'M SEEKS TO ALLOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE [inaudible] I'M. FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT I MISSTATED BY THAT SUPPORTERS I WOULD TEND TO BE SUPPORTIVE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT. WOULD RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF A CITY TO BE. OUR MORE PERMISSIVE. I GUESS I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT IF IF WE GIVE A LOCAL COMMUNITIES DECIDED THAT IT YOU KNOW WANTS. TO I'M. YOU KNOW THE ONCE MORE THIS KIND OF I THINK AT THE COAST. OVER IT WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES THE WEATHER BEING THERE COUNTY OR IN THAT THE SEA LEVEL. I'M I KNOW THAT THE ARGUMENT IS MADE BY THE AUTHOR IS THAT. THE THE OUT HERE IS THAT IT ALLOWS. THE BILL ALLOWS THE CITY. TO ZONE. FOR OUR RESIDENT A SORRY -- TOURIST PRISON RESIDENTIAL RESIDENTIAL TOURISM RESIDENTIAL TOURISM. I'M AND IF THE CITY DOES THAT. THEN. THE PLATFORMS AND STILL BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE [inaudible] I'M. SO I ALSO A BRIBE WAS CONCERNED HOW THIS MIGHT INTERACT WITH SB THREE THIRTY WHICH IS. TENER SKINNER'S BILL THE HOUSE TO DO A DOWN ZONING AND YOU KNOW THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL. THE THE THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO MAKE SURE THAT. IS A DRESS THAT THE LAST THING I WANT TO HAVE IS. FOR US TO HAVE LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT HAS TO DO THAT REQUIRES A REZONING OF SORTS. AND THEN HAVE THAT JAMMED UP BY THE LANGUAGE OF THREE THIRTY A THREE THIRTY IS THE PAST YOU HAPPEN TO PASS I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN A BILL. BUT I JUST WANT -- TO THIS OUT THERE LET ME HEAR FROM OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT. ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU DID I MEAN I KNOW THESE BROADER ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION BUT BUT THE ONE OF THE CRITICAL COMMENT THAT FOR ME IT WAS MADE BY. ONE OF THE WITNESSES JUST NOW AND IT WAS ALSO MADE. IN A I'M. YOU KNOW IN A IN A PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS HAVING OPPOSITION. IS THAT THIS BEST TO RESOLVE THE LOCAL LEVEL AND TO THE EXTENT OF THIS BILL ALLOWS A COMMUNITY. TO DO THE REZONING WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR THE PLATFORMS TO CONTINUE OPERATING IF THAT'S WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS. THAT MAKES ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN THE AND YOU KNOW IF IF SO FOLKS HAVE RESPONSES THAT REACTIONS I'D LOVE TO HEAR. I'VE GOT SOMETHING WRONG IF I'M MISTAKEN. SURE SO OUR BELL WE EXPLICITLY ALLOW THE OPT OUT MECHANISM FOR THE RESIDENTIAL TOURISM. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN IN MAKING SURE TO STATE LAWS DON'T CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER AND CAUSE PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. MORE HAPPY TO TAKE. ONE OF THE REASONS WE DIDN'T WANT TO OPT OUT MECHANISM TO BE A REZONING PROCESS IS BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND THE PUBLIC TO WEIGH IN. PERSON OTHER MECHANISMS I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SELF DETERMINATION LOCAL COMMUNITIES. I LOOK TO HEAR FROM A POSITION OF THAT YEAH I THINK -- OUR OUR CONCERN WOULD STILL BE THAT -- TO SOME DEGREE THE BILL AS IT'S DESIGNED EVEN WITH SORT OF A CHANGE IN THAT WAY IT'S STILL SORT OF CIRCUMVENTING. THE COASTAL COMMISSIONS PROCESS AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN CITIES UP AND DOWN THE COAST -- WHO HAVE WHO HAVE MORE RESTRICTIVE -- POLICIES IN PLACE MORE FLEXIBLE POLICIES IN PLACE AND THERE IS A PROCESS THAT ALREADY EXISTS WHERE. RESIDENTS CAN WEIGH IN -- IN THOSE LOCAL ORDINANCES AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION CAN SORT OF BALANCE THE ACCESS AS WELL AS THE CONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE'D STILL BE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS CAN HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHETHER IT IS. A CITY THAT ONCE MORE RESTRICTIVE POLICIES IN PLACE OR MORE. FLEXIBLE POLICIES IN PLACE THAN WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BILL JUSTICES OF TO PARLAY AFTER THAT I MEAN THE ISSUE IS THE ISSUE THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BANNED. KIND OF STEPPING IN ON THE ABILITY OF CITIES. TO SET THEIR OWN RULES YES SO THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS -- DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY THE BALANCE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WITH COASTAL ACCESS THAT'S NO LONGER THE HOW CLOSE LET THAT WAS REMOVED AND THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SOMEONE A COASTAL COMMISSION LOOKS AT AN ORDINANCE. I CAN ONLY MAKE A DECISION ON COASTAL ACCESS AND JUST FOR A POINT IN THE CASE OUR CASE IN POINT THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL AND I GUARANTEE YOU OF ANYBODY ON THE COAST COMMISSION REALLY WORRIED ABOUT. THIS BILL AFFECTING COASTAL ACCESS THEY WOULD NOT BE NEUTRAL WE ALL KNOW WHO ALL OF US WHO REPRESENT BECAUSE AREAS KNOW EXACTLY HOW THE THE BECAUSE COMMISSION WOULD BE. I WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF THAT WHAT NOW LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION AND MAYBE IT. IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHEN I WAS ASKING. FOR AND THEN ONCE AGAIN IMAGES EFFORTS PERSPECTIVES. I SO YOU FRAME THIS VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS HOUSING AVAILABILITY [inaudible] AND AFFORDABILITY. I WHAT IS TO STOP YOUR BILL FROM SIMPLY BEING USED [inaudible] AS A YOU KNOW AS A AS A GOD. RESIDENT DRIVEN ME ON I HATE THIS WORD BUT NEED ME DRIVEN -- ATTEMPT TO STOP OUTSIDERS FROM COMING INTO TOWN. I AS OPPOSED. TO YOU KNOW THE DEALING WITH IT LIKE A GOOD FAITH ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS HOUSING CHALLENGES. SO SO WHEN. YOU IF YOU IMAGINE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IMAGINE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM. WE PROVIDE 30% OF THE STATE'S LOW COST BECAUSE ACCOMMODATION. WE DO A GOOD JOB AT IT. AND WE ARE I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S BECAUSE EVERYBODY. NO LOCUS BECAUSE ACCOMMODATIONS ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVANCY DO NOT CLUED IN SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. THAT IS JUST LOOK WHAT WE HAVE THE MOTELS HOTELS HOSTELS CAMPSITE. OKAY SO. WE DO A GOOD JOB WE HAVE PEOPLE COMING TO OUR VISITORS ALL THE TIME AND AND SENATORS TO MOVE MY BEACH WE GET THREE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR. NO ONE'S TRYING TO STOP AND AS AS A COUNCIL MEMBER MENTION THEY'RE BUILDING NEW LOW COST BECAUSE ACCOMMODATIONS AND I'D BE WE ARE VISITORS SERVING. COMMUNITY WE ALL KNOW IN THE COASTAL ZONE WE WELCOME VISITORS TO OUR OUR BEACHES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT AT SOME POINT. THERE'S A TIPPING POINT WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A PLACE FOR OUR WORKERS TO LIVE THE PEOPLE WHO CLEAN THOSE AIRBNB IS AND THE V. RB OWES ON THE HOME WAYS. THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITY THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE THE WORKERS TO BUILD OUR FREEWAYS DO NOT HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE THE VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY ARE STRUGGLING. WITH VERY VERY HIGH RENTAL RATES DO NOT HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE FAMILIES ENTIRE SCHOOLS AND SOME OF THESE AREAS HAVE CLOSED DOWN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A FAMILY IS TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. THIS IS. YOU KNOW MY BILL WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED OF HOW DO WE ALLOW. JIM AT HOME SHARING SO PEOPLE CAN EARN THE EXTRA BUCKS ON THE SIDE. AS WELL AS AN PROVIDE THAT EXTRA BOOST TO COASTAL CAPPELLO COSCO ACOSTA ACCOMMODATIONS. AND MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT IS SO CUTE. AND JUST AS A REFERENCE POINT. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE MY CITY IN SIN IS THE AVERAGE HOME PRICE WAS THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT PRICE IS ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TODAY FOR THE FOR YOU KNOW IT'S THIS IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION WHERE WE AGREE THIS IS ONE PART OF THE PROBLEM. BUT IF WE CAN'T STOP THE BLEEDING OUT THE BACK END. WHY SHOULD ANYBODY BILL MORE IN THE COASTAL ZONE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS BOUGHT UP BY OUT OF TOWN AND OUT OF STATE AND OUT O COUNTRY INVESTORS? WHO ARE NOT PROVIDING THE HOUSING THAT OUR COMMUNITY SO DESPERATELY NEED? CAN YOU GIVE ME A A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT BY. RESIDENTIAL TERRORISM LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS ARE I NEVER SEVEN A CITY COUNCIL OKAY -- THAT THAT THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A KIND OF A SEPARATE CATEGORY ALLOWED UNDER LAW. SO SO IT CAME ABOUT ACTUALLY VERY ORGANICALLY THE EYES WAS SPEAKING WITH THE MAYOR OF OCEANSIDE. AND HE WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED MY BILL AND HE SAID WE HAVE HE ZONE CALLED RESIDENTIAL TOURISM AND WHEN YOU READ THE DEFINITION OF THAT ZONE. IT'S MEANT FOR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS AND I THINK IF THE CITY HAS PROPERLY ZONE IS THE WE WANT TO BELIEVE IT OR TERM. BUT NO NO NO IT'S IT'S A RESIDENTIAL TOURISM ABOUT HOW MANY ASIAN OF SUMMER COTTAGES HOMES SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IF YOU GO EAD THE DESCRIPTION. OF THAT ZONE -- IT SPECIFICALLY ALLOWING SHORTER VACATION RENTALS AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH THE OPT OUT MECHANISM THE BELL SO AND WE WILL BE WORKING ON A DEFINITION OF THAT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST SO IT'S VERY CLEAR -- WHEN IN JURISDICTIONS OWNS FOR THE THAT IT'S THERE IT'LL BE CLEAR THAT THAT'S ALL MACINNES THEM OKAY THAT'S IMPORTANT? AND I'VE I WOULD REALLY YOU KNOW. IF I'M GONNA SPORTS TODAY IT REALLY HANGS A LOT ON THAT OKAY SO -- I CERTAINLY I WOULD WANT. TO BE A REVIEW WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT. I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH RELATION AYE BECAUSE IN MY IN MY YOU KNOW AND I I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE AN OVERLY ONEROUS PROCESS -- ONCE AGAIN MY THE IDEA BEING THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE EARLIER. ABOUT THIS. ABOUT RESPECT FOR LOCAL LEVEL DECISION MAKING IF IF. YOU KNOW IF IF THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WANTED. ONE ALLOW FOR THESE PLATFORMS WE ARE THAT WE OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO. AND I'LL CONTINUE FOLLOWING THIS VERY CLOSELY AND IF THERE IS ANY LOCAL ISSUE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES CAUSES ON YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'LL BE BACK TO HELP CLARIFY THAT I WANT I SERVED ON ANTHONY IS CITY COUNCIL I WAS ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION BEFORE THAT. I BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL AND I WILL BE INTRODUCING THIS BILL IF I IF. THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER I KNOW CENTER HERTZBERG HAD A COMMENT OR QUESTION CENTER. THERE IS ONE APOLOGIZE TO THE THE AUTHOR IS REACHED OUT DILIGENTLY ME ON MANY OCCASIONS AND RENTAL OTHERWISE PREDISPOSE IN THE SENATE ON MATTERS DEALING WITH WILDFIRES THAT. THEY CAN WIN MY SCHEDULE DOING THAT SO THE WE MET ONCE. YOU GET A CHANCE TO TO GET INTO THAT I APOLOGIZE TO YOU. ON I KNOW YOU WANTED TIME AND YOU'VE WORKED YOUR BILLS -- IN A FABULOUSLY I GIVE YOU GREAT CREDIT FOR THAT. BUT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS VERY INVOLVED WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION FOR YEARS WHAT I KNOW IN ALL OF MY EXPERIENCE FOR DECADES IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION IS IT EVERYTHING'S ABOUT ACCESS AND OTHERS BEEN LITIGATION. I I I READ QUE I DECIDED THAT IS IN THE IN A PASSIONATE WAY. THAT THE THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS HAS A TEST IN HIS THIS IS ALL THESE COASTAL CITIES I'M INVOLVED THIS IS PROP THE TWENTY WAS PASSED. BUT HOW MANY YEARS AGO THAT WAS BUT AS LONG TIME -- MONEY PROBABLY KNOWS. EVEN WITH HOW. SEVENTY EIGHT NO MONEY LOOK ALL RIGHT HERE BUT CENTER MONEY LOOK GREAT BY THE WAY. SO IN ANY EVENT. IT IS SO THIS IS BEEN THE FACT WE DEALT WITH THIS SO MANY YEARS AND SO MANY APPOINTEES ACCESS ACCESS ACCESS. AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER MEASURES AND OTHER IT BY LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE TENSION BECAUSE COASTAL COMMUNITIES GT GREAT. OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S WHY PEOPLE READ THIS THEY TALK ABOUT FAMILIES AND LESS EXPENSIVE AND ALL THIS STUFF. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE WITH YOUR SEEKING TO DO WITH THE UNDERLYING AND CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ADEN ISSUES OF UNDERSERVED PEOPLE LESS PEOPLE LESS WELL TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCESS PURSES THE ABILITY OF LOCALS? TO DEAL WITH ESPECIALLY WITH HOUSING IT HAS TO DO WITH. BEING A YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SO MANY COMMITTEES IN THIS COMMITTEE OVER SO MANY YEARS WE DEAL WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF ACCESS AND PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS TO THESE. EXTRAORDINARY CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AND ONE OF THE A BATES AGAIN IS THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS CONSISTENTLY SAID THAT HOW DOES WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE RECONCILE WITH THAT VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY. I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF POLICY BUT WHEN YOU GO BACK YOU LOOK AND SAY LOW COST BECAUSE ACCOMODATIONS HOTEL MOTELS HOSTELS AND CAMPSITES. OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEN HE'LL COUNTIES CAUSES ON PROVIDES ONE THIRD OF THAT WE DO A GREAT JOB AND THERE ARE PLACES THAT TO DOCTOR GREAT JOB ON THAT ARE STILL STRUGGLING FOR THAT. SO I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT. I'M SORRY -- WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB PROVIDING THAT MY LOCAL IKANA LODGE IS A HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A NIGHT YOU GO FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR AND THERE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT -- WE LOOK AT OF THREE BEDROOM -- SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL IT'S ABOUT NINETY FIVE DOLLARS I THINK ON AVERAGE NIGHT HAS BEEN CITED THAT'S NINETY FIVE DOLLARS COUNTING FOR PEOPLE PREVENTION THAT'S TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT. THAT IS NOT LOW COST COAST ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MOST OF THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS UNLESS YOU LOOK AT THE MOBILE HOME PARKS THE COMMISSION ADDRESS THAT IN THEIR OPINIONS THAT I READ. THE MIDDLE OF NIGHT SOMETIME I CAN'T MOVE DECISION WAS A BY JUST REMEMBER THAT IS THE IDEA THAT IT PROVIDES THE FAMILY THAT YOU COULD HAVE A KITCHEN AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT IT REALLY IS ABOUT. CREATING THAT AVERAGE OPTION THEY SAID BECAUSE I FOLLOWED UP AS A RESULT OF OUR DISCUSSION A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS I'M FOLLOWING UP AS A RESULT OF OUR DISCUSSION BUT TO ME. YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT I'M JUST TELLING YOU THEY SAID NO. THEY SAID NO SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IF YOU IF YOU'RE SINCERE ABOUT THIS IS MOVES FORWARD I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M NOT HERE TO VOTE ON THAT ISSUE BUT I JUST SUGGESTED. THEN THAT HAVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVED IT ONCE WE PASS THIS BILL MAKE A CONDITION OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION MAKE SUCH AN APPROVAL. FOR THAT IS THAT IT RATHER THAN US SITTING THERE TELLING THE GUYS STOP HAVING OTHER LITIGATION IF YOU'RE BALANCING THESE INEREST WHY CAN'T WE ENGAGE THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND ALSO WITH THAT WITH THE CO SO COMMISSION -- REPRESENTATIVE SEVERAL TIMES. ON THE COAST COMMISSION IS NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE CAUSE MISSION IF. THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT ACTUALLY LIMITING COASTAL ACCESS THEY WOULD NOT BE NEUTRAL FIRST OF ALL I THINK -- THE OPPOSITION HAS BEEN VERY DILIGENT ABOUT SENDING IN LETTERS TO THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION. AND WHAT I THINK WHAT THAT'S ABOUT IS WE DO A GOOD JOB OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY ABOUT PROVIDING THOSE LOCAL SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATIONS ON TOP. EVERY SINGLE PERSON CAN STILL WITHIN THEIR CITY'S ORDINANCE PRINT OUT UP TO NINETY DAYS A YEAR IF THEY PLATFORM HOP SO THIRTY DAYS PER PLATFORM. SO THEY CAN PLATFORM HOT. AN ENTIRE SUMMER THAT'S ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND OF THE YEAR THAT IS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO THE COAST AND BUMPS UP OUR VISITORS SURVEYING -- ACCOMMODATIONS AND TIMES WHEN THERE IS THE HIGHEST DEMANDS. THAT KIND OF AREA OF THAT I WANT TO EXPLORE WITH THE THE WEEKS BOARD MY OFFICE. IS THIS LARGER ISSUE ABOUT ARE YOU REALLY SOLVING A PROBLEM. KIND OF WHAT CENTER AROUND WAS TALKING ABOUT IN OTHER WORDS. HOW MANY HOMES ARE THERE? WHAT'S THE NATURE OF THE HOMES. AND AND AND AND AND WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT SO YOU NOW MAKE THIS PREVENTION OF THIS STUFF THIS IS A LARGER DYNAMIC TO ME I KNOW YOUR LIMITS AND YOU COUNTY BUT I THINK THAT. ALSO STATE LEGISLATORS IN PARTICULAR RATE COAST WE HAVE TO ANALYZE THIS IN A BROADER CONTEXT BECAUSE IT DOES SET OF POLICY. THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW ARE YOU REALLY SOLVING A PROBLEM IS THIS I MEAN ARE THESE LOW INCOME HOUSING ARE THESE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE AVAILABLE AS RENTALS IN SOME WAY. IF IN FACT IT'S COST SO MUCH MONEY TO RENT THEM AIRBNB OR WHATEVER THE OTHER COMPANIES ARE. THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU REALLY AND HOW MANY SUCH UNITS ARE THERE AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM. AND AND YOU KNOW WE WE WE ALL TALK ABOUT HOUSING IN AND OUT WE SEE ALL THESE PROPOSALS. WHAT DO YOU REALLY AFFECTING WHAT HOW MANY HUMAN BEINGS HOW MANY LIVES ARE BEING AFFECTED THE COUNTY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT'S WHAT I ASKED YOU ABOUT I HAD SOME NUMBERS ON IT? BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ONE THING TO TALK ABOUT IT THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES DESERVE MATIC PROBLEM GIVE SO MUCH LAND SO MANY UNITS SO MUCH NUMBERS. WHAT'S THE IMPACT YOU NEED TO IT SEEMS TO ME YOU NEED TO MAKE THAT COMPELLING CASE THAT SHOWS THAT YOUR POLICY RESULTS IN BETTER ISSUES ON HOUSING. GO AHEAD I'LL RESPOND AFTERWARDS BUT HOUSE MEMBER MARK WEST FELONY REALLY I WANT TO FRAME THIS IN AN ARGUMENT FROM MY OWN CITY BECAUSE IMPERIAL BEACHES YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LEAST OF LAW COMMUNITY AND ALL SENIOR COUNTY. AND WHEN AIRBNB THERE ARE STUDIES OUT OF UCLA AND USC THAT DIRECTLY SAY. THIS AFFECTS THE RENTS IN MY COMMUNITY SO THIS IS I'M ALREADY ONE OF THE MOST -- THE MOST I HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING TWO AND THREE JOBS RIGHT NOW AND BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF AIRBNB AND THAT THESE THE THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IT'S ACTUALLY DRIVING UP THE RENTS ON THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE ACTUALLY PEOPLE HAVE TO RAISE THE RENT JUST TO COMPETE WITH. THOSE AND THEY'RE GETTING MORE MONEY SO IT'S IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS MY COMMUNITY AND MAKING PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING TWO JOBS ON FOOD STAMPS AND REALLY NOT BEING ABLE TO GET BY EVEN MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT AND ON ANECDOTAL DATA. THOSE ARE GREAT WORDS ONLY WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE TO MAKE THAT SHOWING YOU SAY YOU'RE CITY IN MIGHT MIGHT IN MY CITY IN MY SOMETHING. IN MY CITY WE POINT WELL IN MY CITY WE HAVE WE'RE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE'VE SEEN THE HIGHEST PROPERTY VALUE INCREASES THE PAST TWO YEARS IN A ROW. 10% LAST YEAR OBVIOUS THAT IT IS HAPPENING IN MY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW. AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS -- CITIES THAT USUALLY HAVE A PERMITTING PROCESS SO WE COULD COUNT THE NUMBER OF PERMITS. BUT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS DO NOT RETURN BACK TO THE CITIES EVEN THE CITIES THAT DO HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH. AIRBNB FOR EXAMPLE THEY RETURN A LUMP SUM THEY DON'T SAY THIS PERSON STATE HERE FOR THIS MANY NIGHTS I'M AT THIS LOCATION SO IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY WHITTLE DOWN THAT NUMBER AND THAT'S HOPEFULLY WHAT. SOME OF THE THINGS OF THIS BILL WILL DO BECAUSE IT CLICKS TO TEA AND MORE. SPECIFYING THAT THE NAME OF THE THE HOST THE LOCATION AND THE NUMBER OF STAYS AND AND THE GUEST ALL BE REMITTED BACK TO THE CITY SO WE CAN. YOU KNOW SO CITY HAS ABILITY TO MANAGE THIS IS WHAT'S BEEN LIST ON THE PLATFORM AND THIS IS WHAT'S BEING ACTUALLY IT WHAT'S WITHIN A PERMIT. MY CITY WE HAD PAID SOMEBODY PART TIME FOR NINE MONTHS JUST TO PUT CHECK THE PLATFORMS AND THEN ISSUE THEM A LETTER SAYING YOU NEED TO HAVE A PERMIT. FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LISTING ON THE PLATFORM THEY DIDN'T HAVE A PERMIT IN JUST MY CITY OF SIXTY TWO THOUSAND WE ESTIMATE THERE ARE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS THAT ARE BEING ROOM OF THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE DUE TO FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THIS. IF WE CANNOT STOP THE BLEEDING OF THE BACK AND NO ONE OF MY COMMUNITY IS DOUBLE MORE BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GOING TO BLEED AND AN EXAMPLE -- COUNCILMEMBER WEST GAVE WAS A T. O. D. DEVELOPMENT WHEN AND THESE A LOT OF POLITICAL CAPITAL TO BUILD IT. FOR THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR WORKERS FOR PEOPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY. TWO HUNDRED UNITS MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THREE MONTHS TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED UNITS WLL FOR ALL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. THAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE PLATFORMS ARE HAVING AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST IF WE'RE A HOUSING CRISIS OR SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL CRISIS. I'D SAY WE'RE IN A HOUSING CRISIS BUT LEADERSHIP QUESTION WE PASSED OUT OF GOVERNANCE THE MAN'S FIVE YEARS AGO. A MEASURE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE WHO'S CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE THAT DEALT WITH THIS VERY ISSUE IN TERMS OF COLLECTING DATA AND WHAT THAT MEANT. AND THE QUESTION WAS THE TIME THAT INFORMED. INFORM THE THINKING HAD TO DO WITH THE ALL OF THE ISSUES IS IT IT WAS THE BALANCE BETWEEN CITIES COLLECTING THE REVENUE RIGHT. AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR THEIR T. O. T.. AND REQUIRED THEM TO DO THAT. HEY AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND THE ISSUE OF GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT WHO'S DOING WHAT AND HOW THEY'RE DOING IT. AND AND WHAT THE AUDIT PROVISIONS WERE IN THE REAL. FOCUS WAS COLLECTING THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE SIDE STEPPING THE MONEY AND THE UNDERLYING ARGUMENT WAS WHAT WE WANT TO FIND OUT THE SITUATION SO WE CAN GATHER NAY BUT NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GO AFTER PEOPLE AND GATHER INFORMATION FOR THAT STUFF. AND THAT WAS THE BALANCE THAT WAS STRUCK AND NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY TOUCHING THAT ISSUE THAT WE WITHOUT NOT TO SAY IT SHOULDN'T CHANGE I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT. BUT I'M JUST SUGGESTING WE WE SPENT MONTHS AND MONTHS GOING TO THIS VERY ISSUE IN GOVERNANCE FINANCE WHEN I WAS CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE. DEALING WITH IT AND WE DECIDED ON A STRUCTURE THAT RELATEDTO COLLECTION WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO COMPENSATE CITIES. RATHER THAN GATHERING INFORMATION THAT THEN COULD. YOU DEAL WITH SOME OF KIND OF THE THE THE PLEASE POWER ISSUE UNDERSTOOD AND IF IT HELPS AT ALL THIS IS. REFERRED ALSO TO GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE SO THEY'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN SHOULD IT PASS COMMITTEE TODAY BUT I APPRECIATE THE THE WAY IN THERE -- SEEING NO OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THE THOROUGH DISCUSSION -- WHEN IT IS A RESPONSE TO SENATOR HURTS FOR WHAT WE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP HERE THE OF A QUICK? FACTS COUPLE OF CLARIFICATIONS ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION PIECE I DON'T BELIEVE THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS TAKEN ANY POSITION I DON'T THINK IT'S DO GET OUT OF THERE TO PROVIDE THROUGH NOT TAKING AND THEY HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION OKAY. YOU'RE CORRECT OKAY AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- FOR THE CITIES THAT ARE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THERE ARE CITIES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO PASS -- FOR ORDINANCES THAT DO RESTRICT ACCESS SO TO THE AUTHOR'S POINT ABOUT -- SAN DIEGO PROVIDING A LOT OF ACCESS -- ONE CITY IN PARTICULAR HAD A SEVEN NIGHT MINIMUM WHICH THE COASTAL COMMISSION THOUGHT WAS TOO RESTRICTIVE AND SO THERE ARE STILL RECENT EXAMPLES OF CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY THAT. ARE LOOKING AT LOOKING TO RETREAT WE RESTRICT ACCESS AND JUST THE LAST POINT ON HOUSING -- THE BILL IS ACTUALLY TARGETING HOSTING PLATFORMS SO TO THE POINT ABOUT THE COASTAL COMMISSION NOT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER HOUSING THE BILL DOES NOT. PROVIDE THAT IN ORDER. TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THE BILL ALSO DOES NOT -- TARGET PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES WHO SHOULD BE OR COULD BE INCENTIVIZE TO PUT THEIR HOMES BACK IN THE LONG TERM RENTAL MARKET. ALL THE BILL REALLY DOES IS LIMIT THE WAY THAT A PROPERTY OWNER CAN ADVERTISE THEIR PROPERTY AND WHAT'S THE STATE'S INTEREST IN UNDERSTOOD. WHO IS GOING TO BE ONE MORE BRIEF COMMENT BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A WE'VE GOT? RELEASE THAT LAST COMMENT WHICH WHICH KIND OF RAISES IT WILL JUST GET GIVE ME GIVE ME A SENSE OF BRIEF. YEAH I JUST OKAY THIS IS WE'VE GOT IT WE GOT SOME FOLKS HERE WAITING HAVE COME A LONG WAYS TO SO JUST BUT PLEASE PROCEED. JUMP IN. YEAH [inaudible] YEAH -- APPRECIATE THE DELIBERATE NATURE THE SENATE AND HIS BODY THOUGH AND IT'S BEEN A THOROUGH DISCUSSIONS YOU AREN'T VERY DELIVERED OF AND YES WE ARE THANK YOU SO MUCH NOTHING IF NOT DELIVERED IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. PLEASE WAY IN THIS OF A ROOF SENATOR BEFORE I ALLOW A MEMBER TO CLOSE HERE [inaudible] I THE DAY A DOES THAT THAT ISSUE I THINK. MY TIE THIS UP IN COURT. YEAH THAT THAT DID THIS THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS IS. PROHIBITING A PARTICULAR. UP APPROACH TO SALES AND MARKETING RATHER THAN. A LAND USE. SO THE SO WE EVALUATED MANY WAYS IT HAS TRIED TO CATCH UP WITH. TO RESPOND TO THAT ISSUE IN YOUR AS PART OF YOUR CLOTHES. SURE WHEN WE DO IT THAT WAY -- SINCE I THINK SO YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT ISSUE OF ANY POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKIER -- IN YOUR CLOTHES AND REJECTS ANY OTHER MEMBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS REYES THANK YOU WELL I DO APPRECIATE THE VERY DELIBERATE OF APPROACH YOU OF ALL TAKEN -- TO THIS BILL. WE CONSIDERED EIGHT DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES OF DRESSING THIS ISSUE BEFORE READING THIS BILL -- AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BALANCING -- THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT WE DO HAVE A HOUSING FOR A CRISIS AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS IS THE EASE OF WHICH PLATFORMS -- AND ABLE THE REMOVAL OF HOUSING FOR THE HOUSING MARKET LOWERS THAT THRESHOLD TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS MORE PROFITABLE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO RENT OUT. A HOME. COUNTED IN ARENA NUMBERS DESIGN FOR A FAMILY OR VETERAN OR SENIORS THEN TO RENTED OUT FOR LONG TERM RUNS WE KNOW FROM STUDIES THAT. THERE WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED RECENTLY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT SHOWED IN MANHATTAN ANOTHER HIGHLAND VALUE AREA THAT RENTAL RATES INCREASE ABOUT 30%. TO THE FULL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS. THIS IS REAL WE I'VE EXPERIENCED IT MY CITY A AND CITY THIS MARKET ACCOUNTS MEMBER WEST AS EXPERIENCE IT AND IMPERIAL BEACH TWO VERY DIFFERENT CITIES IN THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL ZONE. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND I APPRECIATE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR BY THE VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- WE WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION AT THIS TIME -- BUT IF THERE'S NO MOTION ALSO WE CAN WE CAN LEAVE THE MEASURE ON HOLD AND WAIT FOR THEIR MEMBERS BUT BELIEVE IT OFF ALL MOVE THE ITEM BUT I I REALLY -- WATCH THIS DISCUSSION WITH CLOSELY IN AND I THINK THERE'S STILL A NUMBER OF ISSUES HAVE TO BE RESOLVED.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF OUR HERE THIS AFTERNOON ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC MARITIME ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN PRINT -- WERE CURRENTLY REVIEWING -- THE AMENDMENTS SO YOU KNOW WE MAY REVISIT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- PMA AS THE COUNTERPARTY TO THE AISLE W. YOU -- WE HAVE A CONTRACT IN PLACE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT AUTOMATION IS PART OF THE FUTURE AS WE TRY AND BALANCE -- THE ZERO EMISSION GOALS OF THE PORT ALONG WITH STAYING COMPETITIVE IN A VERY -- ROUGH. A COMPETITIVE MARKET IN THAT -- THE FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OF MISTER GIBSON'S -- CONSTITUENTS IS OF AN UTMOST PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US AND WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO BALANCE ALL THE COMPETING INTERESTS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TAKE IN THE VOLUME. OF GOODS -- THROUGH THE LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH PORTS IN PARTICULAR WAS A BAY AREA -- BUT THAT WE BRING IN THE VOLUME TO SUPPORT THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO ACHIEVE THOSE -- OFTENTIMES COMPETITIVE GOALS WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH RESPECT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS FAR AS EMPLOYMENT IT'S A DELICATE BALANCE I KNOW MISTER GIBSON IS WELL AWARE OF AND WE APPRECIATE. HIS WILLINGNESS -- TO BRING THIS ISSUE FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT SO SO THANK YOU TO ALL AND LIKE I SAID WE'LL BE. LOOKING AT THIS BUT THIS IS A LOT MORE DIFFICULT -- THAN ANY OF US WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSHUA SHOT FOR THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION OUR COMPANIES ARE THE OCEAN GOING CARRIERS THE MOVE THE CARGO TO AND FROM THE PARTS OF LONG BEACH AND LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND ALL UP AND DOWN.

FOR AGREEING TO TAKE THOSE A MINUTE CITY BECAUSE CERTAINLY WE BELIEVE THAT'S THAT'S A HAVING A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND WHATIT IS IN THE BILL IS A GOOD THING AND WE HOPE IN SOME WAY. THE PROMULGATION OF THOSE AMENDMENTS REFLECTS IN SOME SALT SMALL PART ARGUE THAT HAVING THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION PICKING CHOOSE WINNERS AND LOSERS AT THESE PORTS AS BETWEEN DIFFERENT AUTOMATION PROJECTS MAYBE ONE HERE MAYBE NOT ONE THERE. IS NOT A GREAT SIGNAL TO BE SENDING THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMUNITY OF COURSE CARGO IS DISCRETIONARY DOESN'T HAVE TO COME TO LONG BEACH.

SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT I BELIEVE. I AM AND YOU MAY PROCEED ONE RIGHT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] I WHICH THANK YOU MEMBERS. AND TO MR SUBSTITUTE CHAIR. WHEN INGESTED ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE BECAUSE ANIMALS TO BLEED OUT INTERNALLY AND? THIS DISRUPTS THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS NATURAL ABILITY TO FIGHT OFF INFECTIONS AND THE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS MANGE. AND THEY FREQUENTLY PERSONS A RESULT. RECENT STUDIES ON WILDLIFE IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS HAVE SHOWN THAT TWENTY ONE OUT OF TWENTY TWO MOUNTAIN LIONS. TESTED POSITIVE FOR EXPOSURE AND FOUR HAVE DIED JUST THAT'S AN UNACCEPTABLE MORTALITY RATE TO REALLY AND THE MORTALITY RATE FOR THESE MAGNIFICENT CREATURES THAT ARE. IN SHORT SUPPLY CERTAINLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- IS IS TOO MUCH. NINETY THREE OF A HUNDRED AND FIVE BOBCATS TESTED POSITIVE FOR EXPOSURE AND SEVENTY OR MORE HAVE DIED FROM RELATED SECONDARY DISEASES FINALLY -- TWENTY THREE OF TWENTY SEVEN COYOTES TESTED POSITIVE FOR EXPOSURE AND TWELVE OF DIED FROM POISONING ANOTHER STUDY REGARDING THE ENDANGERED PACIFIC FISHER. HAS SHOWN THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS AND THREATS THAT ROAD GENOCIDE POSE AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THAT SPECIES NEAR EXTINCTION. JUST LAST MONTH. IN JUNE A NEW STUDY CAME OUT ON THE ENDANGERED SAN JOAQUIN KIT FOX POPULATION. THE STUDY HAS FOUND THAT ROAD GENOCIDE EXPOSURE COMBINED WITH LAND DEVELOPMENT ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THAT POPULATION. AND THIS IS IN THE NEW ISSUE AND FAX SINCE THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BEEN WARNING ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT RODENTICIDE. ARE HAVING ON ALL WILDLIFE IN OUR STATE. AS A RESULT OF THESE WARNINGS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION ENACTED REGULATIONS TO RESTRICT THE SECOND THE USE OF SECOND GENERATION. ANTI COAGULANT PRESIDENTE SIDES. IN THE HOPES OF DECREASING THE NON TARGETED DEATHS. BUT THESE REGULATIONS HAVE NOT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN SECONDARY WILDLIFE POISONINGS INSTEAD LEVELS OF STATE CONSTANT OR INCREASE IN SOME INSTANCES. IN DPR WANTS US TO WAIT FOR A SECOND REVIEW -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO TIMELINE OR END DATE FOR THAT REVIEW. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS OUR WILDLIFE REALLY CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER THERE'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THESE POPULATIONS IN. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT PROHIBITS THE USE THEREFORE OF SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ALSO PROHIBITS THE USE OF FIRST GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY WITH EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD PROCESSING USES. NEW ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND MORE HUMANE MENS OF CONTROLLING RODENT POPULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING SUCCESSFULLY USED BY THE PEST MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY. INCLUDING ACCORDING TO THE OPPOSITION A NEW AND TACKLE COAGULANT RODENTICIDE THAT. DOESN'T TO PERSIST AND THE TARGETED AND AFTER THE TARGETED A MAN ANIMAL HAS INGESTED THEM. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE'VE REACHED AN AGREEMENT ON AMENDMENTS WITH A FOLKS IN THE LIFE SCIENCES INDUSTRY AND WILL BE TAKING THOSE AND APPROPRIATIONS. AND WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH OTHER OPPOSITION. A TODAY WITH ME OUR LINDSAY LETTERS WITH THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND AND LISA OWENS VIANI WITH RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AS WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. A GOOD AFTERNOON -- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS TIFFANY HAPPENED I'M A SCIENTIST AT THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. I RECENTLY CO AUTHORED A PETITION TO LIST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND CENTRAL COAST MOUNTAIN LIONS. AS THREATENED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT BECAUSE MANY OF THE THREATS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MANY. THREATS THEY FACE INCLUDING RODENTICIDE POISONING. THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION REPORTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT 92% OF TESTED MOUNTAIN LIONS. HAD DETECTABLE LEVELS OF ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE IN THEIR BLOOD. SUCH POISONING CAN LEAD TO DIRECT DEATH WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS OR VULNERABILITY TO OTHER PREDATORS AND CONSPECIFICS. EARLIER THIS YEAR A YOUNG MALE OUTLINED IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WAS FOUND DEAD HE HAD SIX DIFFERENT ANTI COAGULANT RHODA DECIDES IN HIS BLOOD. AND INTERNAL HEMORRHAGING IS HAD AMONG. HIS FATHER WAS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS AND HIS EARLY DEATH IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THIS DWINDLING POPULATION. EXPERTS PREDICT THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS MOUNTAINS MOUNTAIN LION POPULATION SHOULD COULD GO EXTINCT WITHIN FIFTY YEARS OR LESS IF NO IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE. TO REDUCE ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES. WE'VE SEEN SECONDARY POISONING FROM ANTI COAGULANT RHODA DECIDES ANOTHER CALIFORNIA PREDATORS SUCH AS BOBCATS COYOTES CALIFORNIA FISHER'S SAN JOAQUIN KIT FOXES AND NUMEROUS RAPTOR. LOCAL EXTINCTIONS OF BOBCATS DUE TO MANGE A PARASITIC SKIN DISEASE IN CARNIVORES LINKED WITH RODENTICIDE POISONING HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ELIMINATION OF THESE IMPORTANT PREDATORS COULD HAVE CASCADING CONSEQUENCES ON THE BIO DIVERSITY AND HEALTH OF OUR ECOSYSTEMS. IMMEDIATE ACTION IS NEEDED AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD BE A LIFE SAVING MEASURE FROM OUTLINES AND MANY OTHER PREDATORS BECAUSE IT TARGETS THE MOST DANGEROUS RODENTICIDE CIVIL PROVIDING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY EXEMPTIONS AS NEEDED. I URGE YOU TO PASS AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S BY A DIVERSITY AND FACILITATE ARE SAFE CO EXISTENCE WITH WILDLIFE THANK YOU. THE VERY MUCH -- SECOND WITNESS IN SUPPORT. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON A COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS LYNN DEALERS IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND -- ONE OF THE% BILL'S SPONSORS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WE'RE ALL IN SUPPORT OF THIS AB SEVENTY EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA ECOSYSTEMS PROTECTION ACT. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM -- TIFFANY OUT CALIFORNIA'S ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING THE STATE'S ICONIC WILDLIFE HAVE BEEN UNDER SIEGE FOR YEARS MUSING THESE ANTI COAGULANT AND DECIDES THERE'S NO DOUBT THE POISON OF THE WHILE IF THE PROBLEM IS SUPPORTED BY SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. IT'S CLEAR THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY DPR IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHILE WELL INTENTIONED DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S ECOSYSTEMS AND WE MUST DO SOMETHING NOW. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE CONTINUE DEGRADATION OF THE SYSTEMS ARE THREATS THE STATE'S CHILDREN AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE SCIENCE TODAY -- TO SEE POINTS OF CLARIFICATION ONE IS THAT THERE IS AN EXEMPTION AVAILABLE UNDER AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR USE OF SCARS. SECOND GENERATION AS I COULD I GET RID AND DECIDES IN CASES OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. KERR'S BEEN MADE -- TO ENSURE THE LEAST PERSON PROCESS FOR APPROVAL OF THESE PRODUCTS IS IS THERE IT'S AVAILABLE THE BILL I'M IT'S PROVIDED FOR UNDER FEDERAL LAW. AND IN ADDITION TO THE SCIENCE THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THERE IS THIS GROUNDSWELL PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. AS THE COMMITTEE IS NO DOUBT SEEN THERE IS OVER FORTY LETTERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL SUBMITTED LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- IN THE PAST SIX YEARS TWENTY NINE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED RESOLUTIONS DISCOURAGING TO CELEBRATE AND DECIDES BY LOCAL BUSINESSES AND THE USED BY RESIDENCES THIS IS ACROSS THE STATE -- FROM JURISDICTIONS FROM MALIBU TO HUMBOLDT. TUMBLE COUNTY TO SANTA CRUZ AND ALL THESE JURISDICTIONS CONCERNED CITIZENS AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE DOING ALL THEY CAN TO LESSEN THE USE OF THESE POISONS. BUT AS YOU KNOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CANNOT ACT ANYTHING BEYOND RESOLUTIONS AS THE STATE'S JOB TO REGULATE POISONS AND BY THE GROUND SWELL THIS SUPPORT -- FROM ACTIVISTS FROM ORGANIZATIONS FROM COUNCIL MEMBERS AND CITY GOVERNMENTS -- AND ALSO OPEN SPACE DISTRICTS THE LESS POISONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA'S NOW THIS UNIQUE POSITION TO ENACT THE SORT OF LEGISLATION THAT THE REST THE COUNTRY'S GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AS A MODEL -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK THIS COMMITTEE FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THE BILL.

JO ELLAN RYAN FOR THE HOLLOW AUDUBON SOCIETY IT'S FOR SUPPORT BY ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP OF BILL ALLEY OF THANK YOU. DOMINIC INDUSTRY IN SUPPORT OF THE COME ON MAN COME ON ACTUALLY THAT'S ISSUE I DO WANT TO SPEAK WITH. OKAY HIRING MERION SO DONE WE WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR TAILS OFF TO TRY AND DO IT MY NAME. IS DOMINIC TOMORROW I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA THE REST OF THE PASTORAL PROPERTIES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY I APOLOGIZE -- I'LL BE DIRECTED TO THE POINT -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL WE POSE THIS BILL BECAUSE IT HAS SEVERAL. PUBLIC POLICY INTERESTS TO HAVE NOT BEEN RECONCILED BY US DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AND SPONSORS. WE HAVE SUBMITTED AND PROPOSES TO HIM THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE WAR EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF CONTROLLING. THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE MATERIALS TO WILDLIFE POPULATIONS AND IN FACT LOOKING AT THE BILL WE FEEL THAT THE BILL WORKS THAT WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED WOULD BE BETTER THAN WHAT'S IN THE BILL NOW. WHAT'S IN THE BILL NOW IS BASICALLY. A PROHIBITION WITH A HUGE EXEMPTION AND THAT EXEMPTION IS FOR AGRICULTURAL USE THAT EXEMPTION IS FOR FOOD PROCESSING THAT EXCEPTIONS FOR BEER AND WINE. THESE ARE MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS IN AGRICULTURAL AREAS THAT ARE THE MOST PROXIMATE TO WILDLIFE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE YOU WERE BANNING THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS IS MOSTLY IN URBAN SETTINGS WHERE YOU DO NOT FIND WILDLIFE? AND YOU ARE CREATING A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM BY DOING SO WHEN MY CLIENTS USE AS CARS THEY DON'T. RUN TO A SECOND GENERATION COAGULANT SAY -- WE'VE GOT RATS WE JUST THROUGHOUT THAT SCARS THERE IS A A PROTOCOL IN A I PM PROCESS INVOLVED IT STARTS WITH SANITATION WHAT IS THE ENVIRONMENT LOOK LIKE IS IT CONDUCIVE TO RATS IS A CONDUCIVE. TO HAVING FORAGE FOR RATS TO FEED ON TO THAT AREA TRACKS THEM SECOND. EXCLUSION HOW DO I KEEP RATS OUT OF A PARTICULAR BUILDING BE AN APARTMENT BUILDING A WAREHOUSE A BIOTECH FACILITY WHAT HAVE YOU. THIRD IF THOSE TWO ISSUES DON'T WORK WHAT CAN WE DO TO DRAW RATS AWAY SO WHEN YOU PUT A BAY BOX OUT YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING I'M OF FOR A BIT BOX DOWN BY THE BUILDING BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE RATS ARE. YOU WANT THOSE RATS AWAY FROM THE TARGETBUILDING SO YOU THROW BAY BOXES. OUT PASSED THE WARNER THE DEN WHERE THE RATS ARE IN ORDER TO DRAW THEM AWAY FROM THE TARGET PROPERTY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT S. CARS ARE ONE PIECE OF A LARGER PROCESS AT A LARGER PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF I PM IN TO DO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD TO ELIMINATE THEIR USE WITH THESE FAST EXEMPTIONS. MOVES AS CARS IN ALLOWS THEIR USE IN PLACES WHERE THE VULNERABLE WILDLIFE POPULATION YOU WANT TO PROTECT. LIVES AND TAKES IT FROM THE PLACE WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IS OUR MOST CRITICAL NEED IN URBAN AREAS AND SO WILL THE MOMENT SO WE HAVE SHARED WITH MR BLOOM AND HIS STAFF AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. JUST QUICKLY AND I WILL FINISH CREATE. A PROCESS THAT ONE HAS A FUNDING. ENFORCEMENT AND THAT FUNDING WOULD COME FROM. THE INDUSTRY. IF YOU'RE A PCO IN SIXTY TO CALIFORNIA AND YOU WANT TO USE THIS CAR IN A BIG BOX HE WOULD BUY A STICKER YOU'D PAY A FEE FOR THAT STICKER THAT FEE WOULD THEN BE PERMITTED TO DPR IN ORDER TO HELP THEM FORSMAN. AND IN THAT STICKER WOULD HAVE ANA CONDITIONS FOR THE USE AND THE TYPE OF USE OF THAT ASKAR HE WITH LIMITED TO FOUR OUNCES FOR INSTANCE IT WOULD LIMITED. TO THIRTY DAYS OR TEN DAYS HE WOULD HAVE CLEAR RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF THOSE MATERIALS. IN THE APPLICATION AND THE CONTROL OF COMMENSAL RODENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A OF A BETTER WAY TO CONTROL THE ACCESS OF THESE MATERIALS TO WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. I THINK WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHORINTO THE PROPONENTS THAT THE BILL WORKS COUNTER TO THE INTENT IF YOUR INTENT IS TO KEEP THESE MATERIALS. AWAY FROM WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. THIS BILL IS AN ACCOMPLISHED THAT YOU HAVE A TON OF ILLEGAL USE GOING ON IN IT. MARIJUANA GROWS UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU HAVE THE TAIL LEFTOVER FROM CONSUMER AVAILABILITY AND YOU CAN STILL BUY THESE MATERIALS OVER THE INTERNET. THIS BILL DOES NOTHING FOR ENFORCEMENT OUR AMENDMENTS WOULD CREATE FUNDING STREAM AND IN A FOUR SEN MECHANISM FOR THESE MATERIALS. RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AUTHOR AGAIN AND THE SPONSORS TO CONSIDER THESE AMENDMENTS TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH US AND TALK WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. IN WORK THROUGH THIS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT ONE WE WANTTO BE HELPFUL WE'RE NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE PROBLEM WE'VE NEVER RUN AWAY FROM THIS PROBLEM. AND W WOULD LIKE TO BE HELPFUL BUT WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO THAT. YOU HAVE RECENT CONVERSATIONS IN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE THAT SEEM PROMISING. BUT I'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS BEFORE SIR WITH ALL DUE RESPECT PLEASE ALLOW US TO HELP YOU. CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THESE MATERIALS ARE LESS AVAILABLE TO WILDLIFE WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR AVAILABILITY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND THE PUBLIC SEE THE HEALTH EXEMPTION AND THIS DOESN'T WORK IT'S A FEDERAL LAW THAT DEALS WITH. THE USE OF MATERIALS OFF LABEL FOR INVASIVE SPECIES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO USE THESE FOR COMMENSAL RODENTS AND SO IT'S IT. BOKI. AN ARTFUL EXEMPTION FOR A REAL PROBLEM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS WE REMAIN OPPOSED AND LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING WE WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IN UNDER THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST AND THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS EXISTING IF WE WOULD JUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SIT DOWN AND BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS WE'D BE ABLE TO GET A MAN. JEFF FISHER THAT -- OTHER FOLKS ONE AND SPEAKING OPPOSITION. YOU GO TO THE MICROPHONE. SORRY SIR RICHARD WOULD APPRECIATE SOMEONE WHO. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALL OF IRAQ FOR A CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING THE LIFE SCIENCES BIOTECH INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES -- BY PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURING MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE START UPS. IT'S AN INDUSTRY THAT EMPLOYS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANT -- ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE STATE OUR POSITION IS IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE'VE ASKED THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR A SIMILAR EXEMPTION -- TO THE THREE THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL TODAY IT WOULD EXCLUDE OUR FACILITIES THAT ARE -- BY NATURE AND DESIGN -- NEED TO BE STERILE ENVIRONMENTS THE REGULATED BY THE FDA INSPECTED BY THE FDA OR THE EUROPEAN JAPANESE OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY. EQUIVALENTS OF THE FDA -- I THINK WE'RE VERY CLOSE. TO FINDING SOME LANGUAGE -- NEW IN CONCEPT WE TALKED -- NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- ABOUT AN EXEMPTION FOR THOSE FACILITIES -- SO I AM HOPEFUL THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THAT LANGUAGE NOT ONLY LETS COUNCIL FORMAT BUT HOPEFULLY AMENDED INTO THE BILL -- ONE THING I DO WANT TO NOTE EVEN THE EPA BUILDING WHO. THAT WAS UNFORTUNATELY FESTIVE IRAQ'S NOT LONG AGO -- IN THEIR STATEMENT WHEN THEY SAID THAT THEY LEARNED OF A RAP PROBLEM IN OUR BUILDINGS EXTERIOR COURTYARD IN CHILD CARE CENTER PLAY YARD. WE TOOK ACTION WITH NON TOXIC PEST MANAGEMENT MEASURES WHEN THOSE MEASURES DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM WE CONSULTED EXPERTS TO DETERMINE THE PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM RODENT BORNE DISEASES. REQUIRED THE ADDITIONAL STEP OF APPLYING A RODENTICIDE WITH STRICT SAFETY PROCEDURES WE WOULD AGREE -- IT THE MANUFACTURE MEDICINES REQUIRES THE SAME. SORT OF PROTECTION -- SO. FOR THAT REASON WE'RE STILL ASKING FOR AN EXEMPTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY OTHER FOLKS ONE OUT IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] OKAY.

WE GOT HERE AT THEIR AYE AYE YES LET ME START WITH A LIFE SCIENCES -- I THINK -- OR HER -- AMENDMENTS KIND OF CROSSED IN THE MAIL -- AND TO I HAVE HERE THE INSTRUCTION TO LET'S COUNSEL TO MAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT I THINK -- RESOLVE ALL OF OUR ISSUES WITH LIFE SCIENCES -- OKAY SO I SUBJECT -- TO ANOTHER REVIEW. I CONSIDER THAT IS SURE TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS -- THEIR POSITION IS AND HAS GENERALLY ALWAYS EEN -- WE WANT TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH YOU IF YOU'LL JUST TAKE OUR LANGUAGE -- AND THAT'S KIND OF WHERE THINGS ARE NOW NOW THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF OF THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BEFORE -- IS THAT LEDGE COUNCIL MY UNDERSTANDING IS LET'S COUNCIL HAS A BOATLOAD OF QUESTIONS ABOUT AND THERE'S CONCERN THAT -- WILL BE REQUIRED TWO THIRDS VOTE IN ADDITION TO THERE BEING. QUESTIONS RAISED TO AND I CAN'T BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THOSE QUESTIONS ARE BUT WHAT IS BEING SUGGESTED TO UP BY THE OPPOSITION. IS -- A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO A TO THIS ISSUE THE AND THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT. OF FRANKLY PRETTY FAR APART BUT DEPENDING ON WHAT WE HEAR BACK FROM LEDGE COUNCIL THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CHANGE OUR OUR POSITION. AND HAPPY TO HEAR THEM OUT CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE'RE PRETTY FAR APART. MISTER IF I MAY COME. TO THE TO THE POINT TO THAT MISTER BLOOM MAKES ABOUT -- US BEING FIGHT AS YOU IS FOR SIX HOURS OUR LANGUAGE WE'VE HAD MANY ITERATIONS. SUBMITTED TO HIM TO HAVE BEEN SENSITIVE TO THE CRITIQUES AND CRITICISMS THAT HEY I'VE HEARD BACK FROM HIM. AND THE SPONSORS OF HIS BILL BUT WE CAN'T GO THIS DIRECTION BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET DESTRUCTION SO. I REJECT THAT. WHOLE HEARTEDLY WE HAVE COME TO THE TABLE AND I FEEL A LITTLE BT LACKEY GETS SLOW RULED FROM TIME TO TIME SO I JUST. I HAVE WORKED ASSIDUOUSLY TO GET LANGUAGE TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF THAT WE COULD WORK ON AND I GET A VERY SLOW RESPONSE TIME SO. I REALLY REALLY AMONG SLIGHTLY OFFENDED BY THE INSINUATION. ACTUALLY. I'M OFFENDED NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY. YEAH I'M ACTUALLY YES IT HAS IMAGES AFFECTED YEAH AND HE MAY JUST BE DISAGREED. ABOUT WHERE THE BILL IS AND WE'RE OUT AGO. AND THAT'S OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE CONSIDERATIONS OKAY CENTER COVER YOUR SO MY MOM. OKAY. READ ALL THE PAPERWORK READ THE BILL -- I AM. THIS TODAY I GUESS ON SOME OF THE SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS IS IN -- IN LOOKING AT AN ISSUE IS IS THAT -- PEOPLE COME UP WITH TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THE SAME POINT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR POINT IS THE SAME. SO -- SOME WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY IT MIGHT MY CONCERN IS THAT I AM CONCERNED WITH. THE URBAN WILDLIFE INTERFACE. AND ON EIGHT AND AND I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE DATA THAT YOU. INDICATED ABOUT -- ABOUT PREDATORS AND THEIR AND THEIR MORTALITY DUE TO THESE KINDS OF OF OF CHEMICALS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WHATEVER WE'RE DOING IS THAT IT'S NOT. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. HAPPENS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE IS ANOTHER SOLUTION THAT WORKS. AND THAT DOESN'T CREATE ALL THE EXCEPTIONS IN THE EXCEPTIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT WELL I'LL I'LL I'LL TELL YOU WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT FACILITIES THAT HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CLEANLINESS YOU JUST. YOU CAN'T TAKE. THE RAP FOOD SAFETY ISSUES THAT. REQUIRE STERILITY IS REALLY WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO SO I'LL BUY A I WILL RELY ON THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN TODAY BUT I WOULD URGE YOU TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE URBAN PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT EXIST AND HAVE MAKE SURE IT'S NOT LEAKING OVER INTO THE INTO THE INTERFACE AND KILLING OFF ANIMALS AND WE DON'T WANT TO KILL. I AM PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL RIGHT NOW AND THEN WE'LL SEE WITH THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE WANTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. YEAH I MEAN I HI. I AM. THIS COMMITTEE Q. I I UNDERSTAND -- YOU KNOW YOU CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES I I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STILL FAR AWAY FROM STRIKING A DEAL WITH -- THE FOLKS AT THE THE DOMINIC REPRESENTS BY. TEN YEAH I I ALSO UNDERSTAND THIS CONTINUES TO BE ALONG A WINDING ROAD YOU GO TO PREPARATIONS NEXT TIME I HAVE I'M SURE THEY'LL BE DISCUSSION THERE AND ON THE FLOOR IN. YEAH I THINK THE BROADER GOAL THE YOU HAVE YEARS OF VITALLY IMPORTANT I I REPRESENT PART OF SEMI COMMANDS AS WELL JST AS YOU. WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT MORE. OF THESE NON LINE THAT'S UP THERE AND SO I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP YOU TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION I I MEAN I I GUESS I HI -- THERE SEEMS TO BE JUST A REAL DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF THE STATE OF YOUR NEGOTIATION -- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT I YOU KNOW. THE THOUGHT WHAT'S ALL COME OUT AND SAY THAT AND THAT'S FINE -- YEAH BUT I'M I'M CERTAINLY YOU KNOW CAN SUPPORT TODAY TOO AND THE SUFFERING [inaudible] I SO. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THOUGHTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE CLOSER SPONSORED ANY THAT. YES -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON RESOLVING THIS BUT THE THE MOST RECENT PROPOSAL IS IS A VERY FROM THE OPPOSITION IS A VERY -- MUCH DIFFERENT APPROACH IT'S COMPLICATED INVOLVES SETTING UP A FEE STRUCTURE MEAN YOU HEARD IT FROM MISTER ACT AMARI WHAT IT IS SO -- THERE'S A LOT THERE AND THE NOTION THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SWITCH A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREES -- ON ON THIS BILL AT THE LAST MINUTE -- IF WE CAN GET THERE WE WILL I THINK -- AND WE WE WORK TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS BUILDING AND I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT I'M SOLUTION ORIENTED -- EVEN WITH SOME OF THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL -- BILLS THAT I'VE THAT I'VE BROUGHT I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO NEGOTIATE AND TRY TO BRING THINGS TO CONCLUSION BUT THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO REACH A POINT WITH THE AG INDUSTRY WITH FOOD PROCESSORS WITH BEER AND WINE -- WITH HOSPITALS THAT THAT WERE CONCERNED -- AT ONE POINT ABOUT THE BILL. WITH THE LIFE SCIENCES. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THIS ISSUE -- ALL THESE ISSUES IT'S NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T BEEN TRY OR WORKING ON IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO YEAH I CAN AND I COULD ONLY IMAGINE.

AND WALKED THAT THROUGH FOR THE COMMITTEE TO MINE COMING UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND YOU CAN WALK THROUGH THAT WITH THE SOURCE I DO NOT MIND MEMBERS WERE ON AB SEVEN NINETEEN THAT'S RUBIO AND GRAY. HI THERE THERE IS NO MOTION AT THIS POINT THERE WERE AMEND WASN'T MOTION BY A SENATOR. THERE ISN'T THERE SORRY. BUT YOU DID NOT TAKE THAT MOTION HE WANTED TO THAT WAS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF OKAY EXTENSION IF YOU STILL WANT TO ACCEPT THAT MOTION WE CAN MOVE IT THAT WAY. BASED ON THE CONVERSATION IF I MAY I AM THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION AND WE CAME UP WITH SOME PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BASED ON A CONVERSATION WITH US SENATOR ALLEN AND THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE. WE SUBMITTED -- TO THE CONSULTANT AND SOUL I'M HERE TO SEE IF THAT'S BECAUSE TAT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE INTERESTED IN THE DO WE HAVE. TO TALK TO UP FOR THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I STILL HAVE NOT SEEN WHATEVER LANGUAGE THAT IS A DISSERVICE SCRIBBLE THAT PIECE OF PAPER SCRIBBLED ON HOW THEY WERE WHICH WELL THE RESPECTIVE MY CONSULTANT HERE THIS IS STILL MORE SCRIBBLE THOUGH -- BUT ALL TO SEE THAT THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE IT MAYBE YOU CAN WALK IT THROUGH AN CONCEPT AND THEN WE CAN SEE. WHATEVER ACTUAL LANGUAGE. WOULD BE HERE -- FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M SORRY. BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE MY UNDERSTANDING IS IS THAT WHAT AT LEAST WE'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY PROPOSE. I OKAY SO WHY DON'T WE GO THROUGH THAT WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU OR OTHERS ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT -- IS THAT WOULD SITTING IN MY HANDS RIGHT NOW THAT'S WITH THE FOR POSE WITH IN YOUR HANDS. OKAY THE PROPOSAL FROM THE AUTHOR FOR AN AMENDMENT IS BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY OR IS THAT ONE'S READING ALONG. I DON'T NEEDTO READ THIS VERBATIM IF YOU CAN SEE IT -- MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS USING THE HIDES OF ALLIGATORS AFTER CONSULTATION SHALL SUBMIT TO RESOURCES TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRACKING TRACING ESSENTIALLY DURING THAT PERIOD THE SUNSET ALLOWING SALES WOULD BE EXTENDED -- ESSENTIALLY TILL TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WOULD BE A ONE YEAR EXTENSION THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING WHILE TRACK AND TRACE MESSAGE. METHOD IS DEVELOPED. GIVING THE SHOT CLOCK SIX MONTHS TO APPROVE THAT TRACK AND TRACE METHOD WITH SECRETARY RESOURCES -- AND THEN THAT. THEIR MANUFACTURES THEN AFTER TWELVE MONTHS. AFTER THAT POINT FOR IMPLEMENTATION -- WHERE THIS SUNSET ON SALES -- WOULD STILL BE. SORRY THAT IT SHOULD BE READ DURING WHICH TWELVE MONTHS THIS SUNSET ON THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WILL BE ALLOWED I THINK IT'S THAT THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WILL BE ALLOWED AS WHICH YOU ACTUALLY MEANT THERE ISN'T THAT WHAT I UNDERSTAND. AND IN THE FINAL PIECES THAT THE CURRENT BAND COULD BE AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUED USE. OF PARKS OF ALLIGATORS FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS' SPECIALIZE FOOD PRODUCTS OR ALLIGATOR MEAT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION TO BE PERMANENTLY ALLOWED -- SO I'LL JUST SPEAK. ON ON MY BEHALF HERE MEMBERS ARE WELCOME I THINK. OUR COLLOQUY EARLIER CENTERED ON THE FACT THAT I WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH ANY EXTENSION -- EVEN IF IT WAS CONDITION ON A ON A TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM -- I WANTED TO SEE THAT SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING BEFORE LOOKING AT ANY EXTENSION -- SAID I'M GONNA STICK WITH THAT POSITION -- BECAUSE I I STILL -- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE SUSTAINABLE FARMERS OUT THERE AND THE FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY -- WHO MAY BE DOING THE RIGHT THING? I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER DAY OF ALLOWING THE WRONG THING COMING IN AND TO ME THAT'S THAT DEADLINES ACTUALLY WHAT'S GOING TO GET IT'S RESULTS BUT I DO RESPECT -- THE THE WORK PUT INTO THIS -- BUT MEMBERS ARE YOU. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO TO WEIGH IN OTHERWISE -- A DIFFERENT OPINION WELL AND I I WANT -- TO ASK MISTER CRAVEN TO SORT OF LAY OUT WHAT. HE HAS MARKED UP I'M WE ACTUALLY WERE ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S EARLIER THAN DECEMBER AND THE REASON BEING. I YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN CENTER STERN. RIGHT -- THE BECAUSE OF CRAVINGS GOT ANYTHING MOCKED UP HERE BUT YOU'RE WELCOME PUT FORWARD AN AMENDMENT TO THIS AMENDMENT -- BUT I DON'T I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BEFORE ME THAT SEEMS LEGIBLE AS AN ALTERATION OF THIS AMENDMENT WOULD YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE DISTRICT YOU WANNA DESCRIBE WHAT WHICH YOU HAVE WHICH I UNDERSTANDING IS BILL AND AND AND THEN I CAN KIND OF TALK ABOUT -- WE TALK ABOUT ASPECTS OF IT WILL. BE IF IT'S YOUR AMENDMENT YOU CAN DESCRIBE IT -- BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS. THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING HIM TO DESCRIBE. OKAY [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] WELL -- THIS IS NOT -- YEAH SO IF YOU'RE DOING WORK FOR YOUR MISTER OUT OF THREE YEAH BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BETTER TO TO WORK WITH PEOPLE NOTED ON YET. NOBODY SEPTEMBER OF NEXT YEAR YEAH. BY SEPTEMBER OF NEXT YEAR MANUFACTURERS I'M JUST GONNA SUMMARIZE THIS WORD -- PROVIDE A PROPOSAL TO THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. THE LAST TRACKING IN TRACING -- OF ALL THE PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THE COMPLIES WITH. INTERNATIONAL FEDERAL AND OTHER ETHICAL FOR REASONS OF STATE LAW. THAT ACCOUNTS. FOR AWAY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE IT. AND THAT INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF HUMANE FARMING AND SLAUGHTER -- THE SECRETARY. IT MEANS THAT FISHING GAME COMMISSION HAS SIX MONTHS TO CONSIDER -- IN IT WOULD BE AT THE END IF THEY APPROVE IT WITHIN BE APPROVED BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE -- THOSE PROPOSALS OR I THAT WHATEVER PROPOSAL IS APPROVED WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE CRITERIA THAT WAS. IN THE THAT I JUST DESCRIBED -- AND THEN THERE'S THE DIRECTOR APPROVES -- THERE WOULD BE. A IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. AND THEN THERE. AFTER THAT IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD THERE WOULD BE A SUNSET. OF TWO YEARS. TO SEE HOW IT WORKS. SO IF I MAY TRY TO SUMMARIZE. I MAY TRY TO SUMMARIZE. YOUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT SENATOR ALLEN -- BY YOU YOU LOOKING AT A SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH DEADLINE AS OPPOSED -- TO A DEADLINE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR -- FOR AN EXTENSION THAT WHILE -- IMPOSING THAT SAME SIX MONTH EXTENSION AS THE DEADLINE ON TRACK AND TRACE BEING UP AND RUNNING SO AS OPPOSED TO THE THE TWO YEAR ORIGINALLY OFFERED OR THE YEAR AND A HALF THEN I THINK WHICH CENTER CABALLERO MADE A MOTION ON THE SHOULD BE. SIX MONTHS FOR THAT EXTENSION. FOR BOTH THE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM TO BE UP AND RUNNING. BUT DURING THE PENDENCY OF THAT. THAT. NEW SYSTEM -- TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION OF OF ALLIGATORS AND PARKS THERE OF THAT CORRECT. YEAH THE IDEA OF DOING SIX MONTHS AS OPPOSED TO GOING THE% FULL YEAR OR FURTHER IS THAT USE REALLY HOLDS. THAT INDUSTRIES FEET TO THE FIRE -- ANYTHING THAT WOULD GO ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST -- BEYOND WOULD ALLOW FOR A NEW BILL TO BE PASSED WITH A MAJORITY VOTE. ON IN THIS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS I THINK YOU PROPERLY ARTICULATE MISTER CHAIR WAS AT THIS ISSUES COME BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE HAS GRANTED EXTENSIONS. TO INDUSTRY OVER AND OVER AGAIN -- AND THEY KEEP MAKING PROMISES ABOUT MEETING ALL OF THESE GREAT STANDARDS ON THIS IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE SURE -- AND IT IS GOING TO IT INSTEAD OF HAVING INDUSTRY BE THE ULTIMATE APPROVER -- THE THE END IF PLACE OF APPROVAL THAT WILL BE DONE BY BY THE DEPARTMENT -- AND THEY'LL THEY WILL TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE PROPOSALS AND AND MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THE DAY -- WE'RE DOING RIGHT BY THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY YOUR ANALYSIS ON PAGE. EIGHT I THINK ANY OF THE DAY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE COME OUT OF THIS. IS I AND I THINK. PART OF THE BROADER PHILOSOPHY THAT WE HAVE HERE WITH AGGRESSIVE ON A POLICY -- IS THE DATE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCOPE AND STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY. TO DRIVE GLOBAL BEHAVIOR ANDIF WE CAN UP UNTIL NOW IT'S OUR SENSE THAT THE THE THE THE TRACK AND TRACE MODEL. THAT IT IS IS INADEQUATE. AND IF WE COULD CREATE A MODEL THAT AT THE IAN THAT COULD ACTUALLY HELP TO THE TO SHIFT BEHAVIOR GLOBALLY. AND THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS COULD ADOPT. WE COULD ACTUALLY REALLY. HELPED TO ADVANCE. OUR BROADER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS -- BUT BY BY DOING IT BY BY PUTTING THE DEADLINE IN SEPTEMBER RATHER THAN FURTHER OUT -- A REALLY HOLDS THE FEET TO THE FIRE OF INDUSTRY IN IN A VERY SUBSTANTIVE WAY LISTED. SO JUST TO BE CLEAR MEMBERS AS TO WHAT. YOU WOULD BE VOTING ON IT FOR MOTION IS MADE -- THE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS MOCK UP YOU'RE SAYING NOTHING IN SECTION FOUR NOTHING IN SECTION [inaudible] THREE SO. YEAH BUT NOT FOR ME. WITHIN THE SAME SET. SO -- MENDING. SECTION FOUR TO NOT SAY PERMANENTLY ALLOWED BUT STILL ALLOWING MEDICAL RESEARCH. AS WELL AS MANUFACTURES SPECIALIZED FOOD PRODUCTS. OKAY SO WE'RE STRIKING YOU'D BE STRIKING OUT AND MANUFACTURE SPECIALIZE FOOD PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW. YEAH IF I CAN SIT HERE AND DO THE THE MOCKING UP FOR YOU BUT I NEED A MORE FULLY BIG PRODUCT BEFORE. WE WE GO FOR TO IF YOU WANT TO MARKET UP OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE COMFORTABLE THAT'S FINE I CAN'T. I CAN'T DO THIS WORK FOR YOU HERE SO -- IF YOU ALL WANT TO SORT OF WORK THROUGH THAT. OR IF MEMBERS FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH THAT MOTION THAT'S FINE I I I I REALLY I I CANNOT SIT HERE AND WORD SMITH FROM THE DíAS -- IF I DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A MOCK UP OF WHAT'S BEFORE ME SO I I'M TRYING TO STRETCH HERE IN BE ACCOMMODATING BUT YOU ARE WELCOME. TO MAKE A MOTION ON WHATEVER CONCEPT YOU JUST ARTICULATED I JUST I CAN'T I CAN'T BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND THAT AT THIS MOMENT. BUT YOU ARE WHAT YOUR WELCOME DO SO CENTER AND IF I CAN JUST CLICK BUY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF I CAN DIGEST WHAT I JUST HEARD THEONLY THING SENATOR ALLEN WANTS TO CHANGE ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER THAT I READ FOR THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS. IS IN THE FIRST LINE TO SAY INSTEAD OF BY DECEMBER THIRTY ONE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THEY SAY DESERVE A SEPTEMBER OR NOT QUITE RIGHT HE'S ALSO SAYING ELIMINATING AND MANUFACTURES SPECIALIZED FOOD PRODUCTS FOR ALLIGATOR MEAT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION IS PERMANENTLY ALLOWED IN THESE CONDITIONING. THE MEDICAL RESEARCH NOT AS A PERMANENT ALLOWANCE BUT AS A TWO YEAR EXTENSION NOT A NOT A PERMANENT ALLOW IT TO CHANGE YOUR PROPOSING THE CHANGE IN PARAGRAPH ONE OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH. TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY CORRECT AND THE SECOND IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING A SUNSET. ON PARAGRAPH FOUR IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. SUNSET ON PARAGRAPH. FOUR WHAT'S ON CITY TALKING ABOUT IN PARAGRAPH [inaudible] FOUR RESEARCH I KNOW SENSE AND WHAT DATES ARE. IF IF I THIS. IF THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM IS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT THEN THAT WOULD EXTEND SO THAT ALL YOU WANT TO SAY HERE'S THE CURRENT BAND. IS AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUOUS DEAL UP INTO SO YOU WANT TO SAY TWO YEARS UP -- TO TO JAN TO JANUARY TWENTY A JANUARY TWENTY TWO INTO. ONLY IN THE OF IN THE EVENT OF WHAT. THE DEPARTMENT APPROVING THE TRACKING TRADE PLAN OLD AND AND ALSO -- ETHICAL THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A PROVISION -- FOR FOR AT THE CALL. HUMANE STANDARDS. MAY FARMING AND SLIDE. THE MAIN FARMING INSIDE. WOULD GO CRAZY. BUT EVEN WITH TRACKING TRADE YOU WANT AND THEN WE GOT OUT OF ICE. I GOT IT YEAH I KNOW IT'S TIGHT I'M IT'S REALLY TIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW NOBODY'S GONNA BE HAPPY WHEN W HAVE ANY OPPOSITION COME UP AND HAVE YOU ALL SEEN THIS THIS LANGUAGE. NO I WAS SITTING IN NO YOU WANNA COME COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND WE CAN JUST WE GET YOUR TAKE ON ON WHAT. YOUR POSITION WOULD BE JUST SO WE CAN TO FURTHER CLARIFY -- CENTER ANNUAL WALK THEM THROUGH YOUR PROPOSED AMENDMENT FOUR MORE TIMES SO YOU CAN GET A SENSE FROM. OPPOSITION ABOUT THEIR TAKE ON IT. NO I UNDERSTAND THEY'VE BEEN SPOKEN THE THEY THEY'VE THEY'VE ALREADY. TALKED TO FOLKS IN AYE AYE ANDERSON THE STILL HAVE CONCERNS I THINK THAT THE THE PROPONENTS HAVE CONCERNS BUT THIS IS A THIS IS REALLY TAKES THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU HAD. THE ISSUES LAID OUT ON PAGE. EIGHT TIMES AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE FEEDBACK BEFORE YOU SPEAK FOR THEM I WANT TO GET A SENSE DIRECTLY FROM THE OPPOSITION. AS TO THEIR TAKE ON THIS SO. WHAT HE'S PROPOSING FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS A SIX MONTH EXTENSION OF THE SUN SAID WELL TRACKING TREES PROGRAMS PUT IN PLACE? AND A TWO YEAR EXTENSION FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH ONLY BUT NOT SPECIALIZED FOODS -- WHAT WHAT WOULD YOUR? HE RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BEFORE YOU HERE -- JUST WANT TO GET A QUICK REACTION FOR THE FOR THE RESTAURANT TERRACE OCCASION. OKAY YEAH PLEASE CLARIFY AT THREE O'CLOCK THIS AFTERNOON DID RECEIVE FROM THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS OFFICE THE THE PROPOSAL FROM THE BILL PROPONENTS I WAS ABLE TO TRACK DOWN MY CLIENT AND VET THAT PROPOSAL WITH THEM. AND IT A NUMBER OF THE ELEMENTS WERE DEEPLY PROBLEMATIC NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW SALES TO CONTINUE. FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS WITH THE LENGTH OF THAT PROCESS THAT IT RESTED THE SOUL THIS. PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THIS THROUGH A CONSULTATION WITH THE SECRETARY WHICH DOESN'T FEEL LIKE AN APPROPRIATE PUBLIC PARTICIPATORY PROCESS FOR US. AND LET'S SEE LOOKING FOR THE REST OF MY COMMENTS -- THAT EXEMPTING MEDICAL PET FOOD AND HUMAN FOOD FROM ANY TRACEABILITY PROGRAM WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC INTERVIEW. SO I AM ONLY RECEIVE LIKE A TAXED VAGUELY DESCRIBING THIS ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL TO THIS AND I JUST I APOLOGIZE BUT I DON'T THINK THE DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IS IN A POSITION. TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION BASED ON THAT CONVERSATION THIS AFTERNOON. BUT THAT'S JUST IF I THINK YES YES -- SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR CENTER WAY SO IT'S OKAY. PLEASE JUMP ON IN. WITH TRACKING TRADE YOU ALSO SUPPORT THE IF SET TRACKING TRADE WAS PUT IN PLACE FOR A IN THE AREA FOR FOOD AND MEDICAL. USE HE WOULD STILL OPPOSE -- ARE YOU WOODS ALSO SPORTS SO SO TO BE CLEAR THE ORGANIZATION I WORK WITH ARE I WORK ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE I BELIEVE ALONG WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS ENERGY SEE SIERRA CLUB DVD AND OTHERS. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUING TO BE ALLOWED ALLOWING A LEGAL. A LEGAL MARKET TO HAVE AN ILLEGAL MARKET FLOURISH HERE AND DURING MY PRIOR TESTIMONY I IDENTIFIED ALL THE WAYS THAT THAT'S HAPPENING NOW. AND SO FOR US WE ARE INTERESTED IN MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH THE PROPONENTS WHO CHOSE TO CONTACT MY CLIENTS DIRECTLY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND DISCUSS IT WITH THEM. IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT A TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM WE WERE THE ONES THAT BROUGHT THAT CONVERSATION UP. BUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT'S DEVELOPED IT'S SUPER COMPLICATED -- WITH THE LAYERS OF STATE FEDERAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND I'M SURE COMPLICATED FOR THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY ISSUES TO IMPLEMENT ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE. BUT IT WOULD MATTER TO US THAT WE NOT KICKED THE CAN AND ALLOWS SALES TO CONTINUE WHILE THAT IS DEVELOPED AND IF THAT MEANS THAT THIS INDUSTRY. DOESN'T GET TO SELL FOR A FEW MONTHS THAT'S THE KIND OF FIRE THAT WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE SET BECAUSE ALL THE RESPECT I'VE SAT HERE THROUGH ALL THESE REPEATED EXTENSIONS. RAISING THESE ISSUES EVERY SINGLE TIME AND I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE AN EMERGENCY TODAY BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT. FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT ALL THESE YEARS OUR CONCERNS WERE NEVER TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND NOW WE ARE HAVE EVIDENCE OF ILLEGAL SHIPMENTS COMING. IT'S A GREAT I'M AND GREAT AMOUNTS THROUGH THE FROM LATIN AMERICA INTO CALIFORNIA THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND THE IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A HALT TO SALES -- TEMPORARILY TO MOTIVATE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY WE'RE THERE TO WORK ON ON DOING THAT IT'S IT'S NOT A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREED A CONCERN FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVE IT'S A PROTECTING ENDANGERED AND IMPERILED SPECIES ACROSS THE GLOBE WHICH YOU CENTER HAVE ACTUALLY. CHAMPION IN EVERY OTHER INSTANCE I'VE SAT HERE AND ASK FOR THE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS SO. SHE THAT YOU DO KERRY YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK I JUST TO JUST TO CLARIFY IN SIMILAR -- OUTLOOK FROM SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION -- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT -- WERE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ANIMAL WELFARE PERSPECTIVE. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT A TRACKING TRADE. WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR THAT ASPECT OF THE DISCUSSION -- AND SO WE WOULD STILL POSE AT THIS POINT. IF ANY OTHER KIND OF PROPOSAL WOULD COME FORTH WITH UP TO LOOK INTO IT UNDERSTOOD -- SO LET'S JUST GET CLEAR CENTER ACCENTORS ALLEN HERTZBERG YOU WANT TO WALK THROUGH ONE MORE TIME FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHICH YOU THINK YOU CAN DO IT OKAY. THANK YOU CENTER. NUMBER BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE HAVE THIS DOCUMENT PILED THE NUMBER ONE THROUGH. FOUR OKAY. FOLLOW ME ALONG FILE A IN PARAGRAPH NUMBER ONE THE DATE DECEMBER THIRTY ONE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY EIGHT CHANGES TO SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY THAT'S CHANGE NUMBER. ONE CHANGE NUMBER TWO IS IN PARAGRAPH -- FOUR GRAPH FOR SAYS I'LL JUST READ IT THE CURRENT. BAND IS AMENDED TO ALLOW RIGHT IT LISTS WHAT IT'S ALLOWED. FOR THAT IT'S HIS PERIOD THIS CONDITIONAL BUT THIS THIS -- PROVISION IS CONDITIONALLY SUNSETS CONDITIONALLY SUNSET ON JANUARY. ONE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TO DATE THIS SUNSET PROVISION DOES NOT APPLY. OKAY IN THE IF THE DEPARTMENT APPROVES A TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM AS SET FORTH ABOVE. AND CERTIFIES HUMANE SLAUGHTER AND FARMING. IT APPLIES IT'S OVER IF THEY DON'T CERTIFY IF THEY CERTIFY YOU MAIN. OF LAW THERE IS NO SUNSET. THAT'S THE THAT I THINK CAPTURES WOULD SENATOR ALAN. HAS ARTICULATED. THOSE TWO CHANGES. AND THEN ON NUMBER THREE IS THAT ALLOWS A TWELVE MONTH SUNSET. EXTENSION WHICH SEEMS TO CONFLICT WITH BY THE DEPARTMENT. SO THE MANUFACTURERS WILL HAVE TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF APPROVAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE PROCESSES BY APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY FOR IMPLEMENTATION. DURING WHICH TWELVE MONTHS THE SUNSET ON THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WILL BE ALLOWED SO DOES THAT TWELVE MONTHS EXTEND BEYOND SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY IS THAT ANOTHER YEAR. OF KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS NUMBER TWENTY AT THE MAJOR SUNSET HAPPENS IN THE MEANTIME -- THIRTIETH RESORT WHICH IS ME EVERYONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE RIGHT WE'RE NOW GENUINE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN THIS WINDOW OF TWELVE MONTHS ACTUALLY HARMONIZES BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS MORE TIME TO DETERMINE. IF THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES IT'S NO HUMANE THAN THAN EVERYTHING SUNSETS I THINK WE HAVE TO GET SOME CLARITY BECAUSE YOU JUST SAID JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT THE SEPTEMBER. RENT YOU KNOW THE WORDS THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT UNDER AS IT RELATES TO PARAGRAPH. FOUR FOR PURPOSES OF PARAGRAPH FOR BUT YOU THE STRIKING OUT THE FINAL LINE IN PARAGRAPH. ONE DURING THIS PERIOD THE SUNSET ALLOWING SLES IS EXTENDED IF NO PROPOSES ARE SUBMITTED HIS SUNSET AND SALE OF PRODUCTS. OKAY [inaudible] THAT'S FINE. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A FAIR ARTICULATION SO -- THIS THERE IT IS YES SENATOR MONNING OUR SO WITH THAT DESCRIPTION -- WOULD YOU. YEAH. ARE YOU WILLING TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS YES AND SO THAT'S A YES OKAY SO -- I'M NOT SAYING I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION BUT IF ONE IS MADE THAT IS YOUR YOUR RIGHT TO DO SO SO -- IS THAT A MOTION.
