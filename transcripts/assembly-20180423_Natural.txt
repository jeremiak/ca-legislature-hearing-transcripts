OF THE BILL WILL BE HEARD ON MAY SEVENTH. AND THAT LEAVES A FULL SCHEDULE OF TWENTY EIGHT BILLS HERE FOR TODAY. AND TO START A SERVE OUR. OFFICE IS A. AT SEA AND WE HAVE MISTER CALDERON. ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR PREPARE. MEMBERS. I. POLITICAL CALL A LONG TIME TO DISCUSS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. SO. REALLY HEROES SIMPLE THIS BILL IS ABOUT DRAWS UPON. SO WHEN WE VOTED AND DINING RESTAURANTS. YOU WANT A STRONG YOU CAN HAVE A STRONG GAVE YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK EQUIPMENT BUT IT'S. FULL SERVICE DINING BUT. ESSENTIALLY NEEDS WHERE YOU'RE BEING STAR. BUY A. CAR OR A WAITRESS AND SO. THAT'S THE ONLY IMPACT THAT THIS BILL HAS IT DOESN'T BAN ANYTHING DOESN'T GET RID OF ANYTHING DOESN'T TELL ANYBODY THEY CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY BUSINESS OR ANY OTHER ENTITY. TO CARRY ANYTHING. THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO CARRY IT JUST STRASBOURG REQUEST YOU GO INTO A DINING RESTAURANT YOU WANNA STRAW YOU CAN HAVE A STRIKE YOU JUST HAVE TO REQUEST IT. ON THE REASON WHY I'M DOING THIS BILL.IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH SINGLE USE PLASTIC. ENDING UP IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR OCEAN OUR WATERWAYS AND. OUR LANDFILLS ARE YOU KNOW TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION ARE FOUND THAT. PLASTIC STRAWS WITH THE SIX MOST PREVALENT ITEM AND SANCTION BEACH CLEANUPS THAT WERE FOUND ON CALIFORNIA BEACHES AS THESE PLASTICS GET INTO THE OCEAN THEY BREAK DOWN INTO MICRO PLASTICS. WHICH ACTUALLY ACT AS A SPONGE AND ATTRACT TOXINS TOXINS THAT ARE THEN INGESTED BY FISH BECAUSE FISH THINK THEIR FOOD ODD THESE PLASTICS CAN EVEN BECOME SO FINE THAT THEY BECOME A MICRO PLASTIC EXCUSE ME A NANO PLASTIC. I STILL FIND THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE FISH DOES NOT EVEN HAVE TO PHYSICALLY INGEST THE. ARE THE PLASTIC THAT IT GOES IT'S ALL FINALLY JUST GOES DIRECTLY THROUGH THE SKIN THE FISH DIRECTLY INTO THE CELLS AND THEN WE IN TURN IT AT THE. THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD GETS THERE. THEIR THEIR THEIR FOOD FROM THE OCEAN AND SO WE WE WE COULD BE POTENTIALLY POISONING OURSELVES AYE AND IT CAN'T BE OVERSTATED THAT. OUR RESEARCHERS I SAY THAT BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY. THERE COULD BE OR THERE WILL BE MORE PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THEN THERE ARE FISH. I AND SO THESE ARE REAL ISSUES A LOT OF CITIES HAVE TAKEN OUR STEPS ARE TO REDUCE SINGLE USE PLASTICS YOU HAVE SOME CITIES ACT IF FOR EXAMPLE DAVIS APPEARED SACRAMENTO THAT. ALREADY HAS A STRAW THE PLAN REQUEST POLICIES FOR THEIR DINING RESTAURANTS. THE CITY OF MALIBU BANNED ALL SINGLE USE PLASTICS VERY RECENTLY SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CATCHING ON AND THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE MEASURE AYE IT'S MEANT IN INTENDED TO BE A REASONABLE MEASURE TO HELP. CUT DOWN ON THE CONSUMPTION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC DOESN'T BAN ANYTHING DOESN'T TELL ANYBODY THEY CAN DO ANYTHING JUST AS IF YOU WANT TO THROW YOU CAN HAVE IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO REQUEST IT AT A DINING RESTAURANT. THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL THE BILL DOES ON I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WE MOVE ALONG BUT WITH ME. ARE IN SUPPORT ARE TO TESTIFY IS KELLY MAY BE REPRESENTING OUR THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AS WELL SHELBY O'NEILL WHO IS THE FOUNDER OF JUNE AN OCEAN. JUNIOR OCEAN GUARDIAN I THINK YOU MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. WE HAVE A FORUM NOW AND SO I LIKE TO TAKE PRO. MEMBERS WENT THROUGH CHIEF THERE MURATSUCHI HERE ACOSTA.

THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CALDERON YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU SHARON MEMBERS. TELLING ME TO BE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP. CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AYE WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AS IT IS A SIMPLE MEASURE. THAT WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH THE RIGHT. CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT A PLASTIC STRAW. AND MAKING THE SURF TO A STATEWIDE PLASTIC STRAWS UPON REQUEST POLICY AT THIS MEASURE WILL BEGIN TO REDUCE THE NATIONAL BENCHMARK. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PLASTIC STRAWS USED EVERYDAY ACROSS THE UNITED STATES EQUIVALENT OF ONE POINT SIX DRAWS PER PERSON PER DAY. AND THE RESTAURANTS A BIT OF OVERHEAD IN THE PROCESS. HOWEVER THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BILL EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE REDUCTION THAT IT WILL MAKE TO CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL WE STREAM. AS THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF ASKING CUSTOMERS WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT A STRAW WILL SERVE AS THE CATALYST TO GET PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OVERALL PLASTIC CONSUMPTION. GETTING PEOPLE TO ASK THE QUESTION DO WE REALLY NEED THIS. NOT A TIME WHEN A GLOBE IS FACING A PLASTIC POLLUTION CRISIS ASKING A SIMPLE QUESTION AND DEMANDING MORE SUSTAINABLE PLASTIC PRODUCTION AND USE WILL SUPPORT SOURCE REDUCTION WHICH WE KNOW IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS. OF TACKLING PLASTIC POLLUTION. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON MENTIONED IF WE DO NOT BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS WE WILL SEE MORE FISH THAN PLASTIC ARE MORE PLASTIC THAN FISH IN THE OCEAN BY TWENTY. FIFTY AYE AND IN JUST SEVEN YEARS THAT SAME STUDY PREDICTS DIED PLASTIC WILL OUTWEIGH FETISH I'VE THREE TO ONE BY. I JUST THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. I KNOW ADDITIONALLY PLASTIC POLLUTES OUR ENVIRONMENT THROUGH ITS ENTIRE LIFECYCLE NOTCHES DISPOSAL BUT FROM EXTRACTION AND PRODUCTION. AS VIRTUALLY ALL PLASTICS ARE PRODUCED FROM CHEMICAL SOURCED FROM FOSSIL FUELS MEANING THAT A FAILURE TO REDUCE OUR PLASTIC PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION WOULD BE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH CALIFORNIANS LANDMARK GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION. GOALS. A CLOSE BY MENTIONING THAT YESTERDAY'S A GLOBAL EARTH DAY THEME WAS ENDING CLASSIC POLLUTION. BUT TO ACHIEVE THIS CHALLENGE WE WILL NEED SIGNIFICANT POLICIES BEYOND JUST. STRAW'S UPON REQUEST HOWEVER ON THE HEELS OF EARTH DAY AT THIS BILL WOULD TAKE A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN EDUCATING CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THE PLASTIC POLLUTION CRISIS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU PROVIDE THEM WITH OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE EMPOWERED BY THEIR DAILY ABILITY TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF SINGLE USE PLASTICS WEBSPHERE I DON'T THINK IT. THANK YOU.

AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY SIX THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE AIR BE TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN AN INVENTORY. OF EMISSIONS OF GHGS ON CONSUMPTION BASED ACCOUNTING BASIS THIS CONSUMPTION BASED INVENTORY WOULD NOT APPLY TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THE CALIFORNIA GLOBAL WARMING. SOLUTIONS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SIX IT INSTEAD WOULD BE USED AS A TOOL TO BETTER ASSESS HOW WELL THE STATUS REDUCING ITS OVERALL CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND KEEP WITH THE STATE'SEFFORT TO MINIMIZE GHG EMISSIONS LEAKAGE REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE GOES BEYOND REDUCING EMISSIONS JUST INSIDE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT HAS DEVELOPED THE CONSUMPTION BASED CHEECH DE EMISSIONS INVENTORY NOTING THAT IT PROVIDES. A MORE COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF HOW THE REGION CONTRIBUTES TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE WITH ME TODAY. TO TALK ABOUT THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S CONSUMPTION INVENTORY IS THE DISTRICTS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR MISTER THOMASON THANK YOU. THOUGHT GOOD AFTERNOON CHEERING MEMBERS TOM EDISON WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. OUR BOARD IS NOT YET HAVE A POSITION I HAD HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL WE'RE RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT POSITION AYE ESTATE OUT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE WERE ADOPTING OUR CLEAN AIR PLAN A LOOKING AT BOTH CRITERIA TOXIC SYNCLINE THAT. WE INCLUDED A CONSUMPTION BASED EMISSIONS INVENTORY. AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE REGION WE ALSO THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE STATE. HI IT'S NOT AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES NECESSARILY AN EASY THING TO DO WHEN THEY'RE CERTAINLY OR. ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE AND YOU HAVE TO DO SOME APPROXIMATION BUT NEVERTHELESS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IS A STATE IN TERMS OF D. H. T.'S WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GO. THUS WERE A SUPPORTIVE OF OF THE MEASURE AND ENCOURAGING HER SUPPORT FOR IT. WE WORKED WITH UC BERKELEY. TO HELP US IN THAT. ANALYSIS AND QUANTIFICATION. WE NOTE THAT THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES ARE SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHO MIGHT BE PASSED ON. WHAT WHAT ORT OF AN ENTITY MIGHT BE PASSED AWAY THE WORK ON THAT THAT ALL MAKES SENSE TO US?

EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO LIMON. MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ MULLIN DOES NO RAYOS. STONE. STONE I. FIVE THREE FIVE THREE THE BILL IS ON CALL. THINK VERY MUCH AS CHAIR MEMBERS YOU. NEXT WE HAVE. MISTER CHU AND. MISTER GRAYSON. ITEM TWENTY SEVEN. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE. I THINK IT IS A CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE IT'S A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE BAY AREA RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM TO ESTABLISH TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT ZONING STANDARDS. THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ONLY ON PARK ONLY AND WITHIN A HALF MILE FROM THE STATION. WHY DO WE NEED THIS ARE ARE BAY AREA SUFFERING FROM TOO INTENSE CRISES THAT SEVERELY IMPACTS ARE BARNETT? HOUSING CRISIS AND A CONGESTION CRISIS. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF HOUSING COUNTLESS RESIDENTS SPEND HOURS IN GRIDLOCK DRIVING BETWEEN THEIR WORK AND WHERE THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE. LAST YEAR AVERAGING. SEVENTY NINE HOUR SITTING IN GRIDLOCK ON TOP OF AWFUL COMMUTES THAT ARE RELEASING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. UNFORTUNATE TODAY MANY BART STATIONS ARE SURROUNDED BY ACRES OF ASPHALT PARKING LOTS FILLED WITH CARS BY DAY. AND VACANT AND EMPTY LOTS BY NIGHT. THIS BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE PART HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS BUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE DEVELOPER PARCELS ARE STILL PARKING LOTS. TOO MANY CITIES HAVE NOT BUILT ANY STE ANY HOUSING NEXT TO A STATION AND THE ONLY ONES THAT DID. WATER DOWN PROJECTS AND OFTEN TOOK TEN TO TWENTY YEARS FOR APPROVAL. THIS IS A NARROWLY TAILORED TO THE BILL. IT ONLY APPLIES TO BARK ON LAND THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR SO ACRES THAT ARE NOW NINETY FIVE PERCENT PARKING LOT. INTERESTINGLY PARK COULD TODAY BILL TRANSIT FACILITIES WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL APPROVALS BUT CANNOT BUILD OR PERMIT MIXED USE HOUSING. UP OR SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT. IT ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE PARTS STATIONS IN AREAS DIRECTLY REPRESENTED ON THE ELECTED PART BOARD. THAT WOULD CREATE DIRECT POLITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND THUS IS REALLY A DISTRICT BILL FOR MY CITY A CITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO MISTER GRAYSON'S CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE PARK BOARD TO ESTABLISH BROUGHT TO DIS OWNING STANDARDS WITH TWENTY PERCENT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. A CITY WOULD HAVE TWO YEARS TO UPDATE THEIR MORE SPECIFIC SUNNY WITHIN BROADER GUIDELINE. BART WOULD BE OBLIGED TO INCORPORATE LOCAL DESIGN GUIDELINES IN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RTO DE DEVELOPERS. CITIES THAT MEET MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARENA WOULD BE EXEMPTED OUR AND WITH THAT THE STIMULATIVE OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS MR GRAYSON. THANK YOU AND CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU TODAY OF RELYING TO PRESENT. THE I AM HERE TO GIVE NOT ONLY JUST. AN ANTIDOTE OF OF THE WAY BART AND THE CITY'S WORK TOGETHER BUT ALSO MENTIONED IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE INCREDIBLY UNIQUE SUCH AS WHAT WE FIND WITH BART AND BARK OWNED PROPERTY. IN THE MIST OF CITIES IN A THREE COUNTY AREA WHERE IT WHERE EVERY AREA THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WOULD BE REPRESENTED BY AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHERE FOLKS CONSTITUENTS STILL HAVE. PLENTY OF OUR ABILITY TO HAVE INPUT AS WELL AS TO HAVE REPRESENTATION BY VOICE ON A BOARD THAT IS p JUST FOR INFORMATION I THINK IT'S WORTHY TO NOTE. THAT THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT. THAT OF THIS WHAT IMPACT. ONLY INCREASED A NET INCREASE OF A HUNDRED AND NINE LIVING UNITS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS THIS IS NOT MEETING THE NEED. AND SO WE WONDER WHY OUR HOUSING IS GOING UP AS HIGH AS IT IS WHEN WE HAVE CITIES THAT ARE ONLY PRODUCING A NET INCREASE ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES HOUSING ESTIMATES. ALONG WITH THAT OF THE CONCERN HAS BEEN EXPRESSED THAT OF BART WOULD NOT WORK OR WOULD HAVE STRAINED RELATIONS WITH LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND AGENCIES. IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS I'M HERE TO ATTEST THAT WHEN I SERVED AS MAYOR OF VIA OF CONCORD. THAT BART WAS PROPOSING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT FOR THE DOWNTOWN BART STATION. AND. I WILL TELL YOU WHEN THEY CAME IN AT SUBMITTED THEIR PLANS TO THE CITY FOR REVIEW. THE CITY HAD QUITE EXTENSIVE. OPINIONS AND ALSO ALTERATIONS AND IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CASE EVEN DOWN TO THE LIGHT STANDARDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE USED BART CONCEDED AND WENT ALONG WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CITY SO. THERE IS HISTORICAL PRECEDENT FOR BART WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CITIES TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BOTH PARTIES. THAT. THANK YOU WANNA TURN IT OVER TO WHAT ONE OF OUR SPONSORS FROM NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION BUT ALSO MENTION. THERE IS A MEMBER FROM THE PARK BOARD OF DIRECTORS MISTER NICK JUST SIPOWICZ WHO'S HERE IN CASE THERE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE ARE WITH SPECIFIC TECHNICAL UNSPECIFIC TECHNICAL ISSUES. MICHAEL AND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THE BEAR WERE LACKING GO FOR MORE THAN TEN MILLION DOLLARS PER ACRE. PUBLICLY HEALTH PLANS A VALUABLE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE. GIVEN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTED PLAN TO BE INVEST IN THE BART SYSTEM THIS LAND MUST BE USED WISELY AND PROVIDE REAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS. PRIOR TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN ADOPTION OF PARTS TOT GUIDELINES THERE WAS A MORE THAN TO YOUR PUBLIC PROCESS IN WHICH MANY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING MINE PARTICIPATED. AND THE SMART AND PROGRESSIVE THE GUIDELINES FOR VERY WELL KNOWN AND ADMIRED. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICY INCLUDED IS EXCELLENT AND WE NEED THE COOPERATION OF IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NOW FOR EXPEDITED IMPLEMENTATION. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ARE FEASIBLE WITH THE APPROPRIATE DENSITY AND DESIGN STANDARDS. THESE POLICIES ARE ALREADY EMBEDDED IN KEY STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE PROGRAMS. SUCH AS THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH IS AS FUNNY WITH CAP AND TRADE RESOURCES. AS WELL AS THE THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE PROGRAM. OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN PH STAND RIGHT TO DELIVER TRANSIT OR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON BART SITES BUT WE NEED THE ZONING DENSITY AND DESIGN STANDARDS TO BE A LINES AND WE URGE DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHILE ALSO WANT TO WELCOME MISTER JUST JUST JUST SIMPLE WHAT SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO US A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S DIRECTOR NICK TO SURF WITH SOME VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BART BOARD LIKE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BART BOARD. I AM DIRECTLY ELECTED BY THE RESIDENTS OF MY PARK DISTRICT. I'M WHICH IS AN EXCEPTIONAL RANGE BEEN FOR RAIL TRANSIT AGENCY IN RELEVANT FOR THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL. BOUGHT HAS ADOPTED A NEUTRAL POSITION ON AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE BONTA SO LONG STANDING. POLICY AND PRACTICE OF CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE CITY AND COUNTY. PARTNERS AND WE WILL CONTINUE THIS GENUINE COMPLETE COLLABORATION WEATHER AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE BECOMES LAW OR NOT. I'M A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS JURISDICTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO RUNNING AN EFFICIENT MASS TRANSIT. INTAKE MENU TRIPLE POSITION HOWEVER PART OF KNOWLEDGE IS THAT AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE WOULD PLAY A. VITAL ROLE IN ACHIEVING BOX GOALS REGIONAL GOALS AND IN MOST CASES THE GOALS OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. WHICH ABOUT SERBS BOUGHT OWNS ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES OF DEVELOPED BILL PROPERTY. AND WILL NEED TO DEVELOP NEARLY ALL OF IT TO MEET OUR TARGET OF TWENTY THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS SEVEN THOUSAND OF WHICH WOULD BE AFFORDABLE. AND FOR THE HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE. AB HISTORICAL RATE OF DEVELOPMENT THIS WILL TAKE NOT YEARS. NOT DECADES BUT GENERATIONS. AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL. SO VITAL. I'M THIS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE BILL'S ALSO THOSE FOR BEING EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO BAR AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I'M AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT WE KNOW AND I REALIZE I SHOULD OPEN MY STATEMENT BY SAYING. I ACCEPT THAT SUGGESTED COMMITMENTS. THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS OF ALL EUROPE HAVE THE CITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO'S FOR THE BILL. SUCH SHORT ON BEHALF OF THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. SO IT'S A MAD MAD WITH LIGHTHOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIANS PART ABOUT THINKING. THEY MISTER CHAIR KEYSTONE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THE BILL. GEN A PRESS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MATTHEW BIG RECLINING CONSERVATION LEAGUE PCO HAS NOT HAD A FORMAL POSITION AS OF YET ON THIS BILL BUT. WE ARE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT WE ALSO ARE CONSIDERING IN AND. PORTING SEACM JUST AMENDMENTS FROM PUBLIC ADVOCATES CONCERNING LONG TERM ANTI DISPLACEMENT MEASURES BUT. THE PROPONENTS OF IT WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH US AND PUBLIC ADVOCATES AND WE. ARE CONFIDENT THAT THOSE ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED AND WE DO HOPE THAT THIS MOVE FORWARD PAYING HIM. CHAIRMAN RECESS IDEAS ABOUT HALF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL THE CO SPONSORS ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT. ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. XENA WHO THE BILL. ALRIGHT. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS EGGMAN. OTHER THINK I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THIS KIND OF INNOVATIVE IDEA O BE ABLE TO MOVE SOME THINGS FORWARD. A AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS A LOT OF LOT OF MY RESIDENTS WHO ARE COMMITTING TO THE BAY AREA IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME SITTING IN TRAFFIC. I THINK THE MORE WE CAN CLEAR THAT UP THE BETTER OFF THAT WE ALL ARE. I PROJECT. MR MCCARTY THING AND I I SUPPORT THIS ON YOU KNOW THE OFFICE IS NOT HERE BUT BUT I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS IS THEIR DISCRETION AND AND AND LOCAL CONTROL. IT ANYTHING ONE AT THAT WELL I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY SAY THAT. THE THE COUPLE OF ENTITIES THAT HAVE. POSED AT THIS POINT THIS ONLY APPLIES TO BART ONLY AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ACRES THAT CURRENTLY AT THIS MOMENT ARE. PARKING LOTS AND. I EAT I JUST HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME THE SUGGESTION OF A SOME CONCERNS AROUND DISPLACEMENT. ARE YOU CAN'T REALLY DISPLACEMENT OFF A PARKING LOT. AND I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE IDEA THAT IF WE PUT HOUSING ON PARKING LOTS THAT MIGHT HAVE DISPLACEMENT EFFECTS IN OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS AND CERTAINLY WE CAN WE CAN ADDRESS THAT BUT ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE. IN THIS A BILL IS A TWENTY PERCENT AT LEAST OF WHATEVER'S PROPOSED NEEDS TO BE AFFORDABLE SO. ARESO I THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT I KNOW CARES VERY MUCH ABOUT. CONGESTION OUT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP SUSTAINABILITY WALKABILITY REDUCE CAR USE CONGESTION AND GREENHOUSE GASES AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS A. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MELISSA MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I. CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE. THE ISSUES THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING. IN YOUR DISTRICT WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING I THINK WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING THAT DRUG CALIFORNIA BUT MY CONCERN IS. IS BESTOWING THIS TYPE OF. POWER TO AN ELECTED. MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR LET ME JUST ANSWER THAT BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT UNELECTED MEMBERS BART THE PARKS BOARD IS I BELIEVE THE ONLY MAJOR TRANSIT AGENCY INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS ACTUALLY ELECTED. BY CONSTITUENTS AND THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO THE OUT THOSE PARK STATIONS WHERE THERE ARE DIRECTLY ELECTED MEMBERS SO FOR EXAMPLE TO COMPLETE. CARVE OUT FOR ONLY THE AREAS. THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY ELECTED MEMBERS THAT'S RIGHT IN FACT THERE ARE BUNCH SPORTS STATIONS THAT I WOULD LOVE TO BUILD HOUSING AROUND BUT BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT THERE'S NOT A DIRECTLY ELECTED MEMBER IN THAT AREA. WE CARVE THAT OUT BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATED THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE IF MIXTURE SEPARATES WHO REPRESENT SANFRANCISCO. SUPPORTS DEVELOPMENT AND OUR CONSTITUENTS DON'T LIKE THAT THEY CAN VOTE HIM OUT IN THE NEXT ELECTION. AND AND THAT'S. BOTH THE RESPECT MISTER JUST UP WHICH THAT'S IN PART WHAT THIS IS ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S AN ALIGNMENT. OKAY WELL THAT'S. HELPFUL IT'S REALLY YOU IT'S QUITE UNIQUE IT'S. I LIKE AND I COMMEND YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT YOU'VE ADDRESS THAT CONCERN. I STILL. YOU KNOW MENTION WAS MADE THAT THERE WILL BE. TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS BUILT SEVEN THOUSAND OF WHICH WOULD BE AFFORDABLE. WHICH IS. NOT VERY HIGH NUMBER CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF UNITS HE WOULD NEED AND THE BAY AREA TO SATISFY THE NEED THAT EXISTS THERE. THE WHEN I LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THERE'S FOUR AND A OVER WHILE FOUR AND HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL. THAT WILL BE GOING IN. I WONDER WHERE EVERYONE'S GOING TO PARK. SO THERE'S NOTHING FROM A LAND USE I KIND OF I JUST I GUESS I IT FEELS AS THOUGH THIS IS BEING PRESENTED AS A WAY TO. SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. IN THE BAY AREA OR AT LEAST MAKE A DENT IN IT AND I JUST. DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE CASE I THINK THE POLICIES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE BY THIS LEGISLATURE THE REASON FOR THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING AND THE HIGH COST OF LAND AND THE IT INABILITY TO TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I DON'T THINK TAKING THE PARKING LOTS AWAY. FROM BART IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT BONUS POINTS FOR BEING. CREATIVE. AND HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THIS PROBLEM BUT I'M FOR CHECK CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT I AM A A DEFERRED TO THE PARK DIRECTOR IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS BUT ALSO A FEW THINGS WE WE ARE NOT CLAIMING THAT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA BUT WE DO THINK. THAT TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING ON TOP OF SURFACE PARKING LOTS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THAT'S THE FIRST THOUGHT THE SECOND IS. WE'RE NOT REMOVING PARKING SO THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR HOUSING A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT TO GO UP ON TOP OF A PARKING LOT BUT YOU COULD BUILD A PARKING GARAGE YOU CAN STILL. ALLOW FOR PARKING ALTHOUGH OUR HOPE IS WITH TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS THEY'RE BUILT RIGHT ON TOP OF BART STATIONS THAT THAT DOES AT LEAST ELIMINATE THE DEMAND FOR PARKING. OF THE FOLKS WHO LIVE. A WHO LIVE RIGHT THERE SO WE COULD STILL ALLOW FOR PARKING I ACTUALLY LOVE TO TURN IT OVER TO MISTER JOSEPH WHAT'S BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS BEN AND. A DISCUSSION THAT I JUST DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WHO WANT HOME. IN YOUR AREA BUT CAN'T FIND ONE OR CAN'T AFFORD ONE. PLAN EVER EXPECT YOU TO KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER DISEASE. I WITH MY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK YOU THIRDS OF THE BAY AREA IS STRUGGLING WITH OR ELSE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY AND I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT SO AGAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS GOING TO AND THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT I THINK THIS IS. A VERY TAYLOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT POLICY THAT TAKES A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO DO THE KIND OF TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT THAT WE WANT. AND AND THIS ONLY ADDRESSES PART OWN LAND IF YOU KNOW BUT THERE ARE OTHER PROPOSALS OUT THERE THAT WOULD IMPACT. A MORE LAND AROUND TRANSIT STATIONS THAT IS NOT THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS MEANT TO BE. CAREFULLY CARVED OUT PROPOSAL AROUND PARTLY. RIGHT THANK YOU. MYTHS AND MIS EGGMAN THEN MR ACOSTA. AT NIGHT. THEM. CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT SO FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR ANYWHERE AROUND THE BAY AREA. I DON'T KNOW IF IF IF PEOPLE REALIZED WIN IT TWENTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING FREES UP A LOT OF THINGS BECAUSE IF THERE'S NOT ROOM FOR PEOPLE LIVE. THEY THEN GO TO ADJACENT COMMUNITIES AND FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKE REPREHENSIBLE PRESENT STOCKTON THROUGH AB. VERY DIFFICULT TIME WHEN BEFORE EVERYBODY MOVED TO STOCKTON UNTIL THE HOUSING PRICES IT CRASHED WE WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY A PART OF THAT WAS BECAUSE THE INABILITY OF THE BAY AREA TO BE ABLE TO CREATE ANY KIND OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO PEOPLE CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT INTO THE VALLEY AND THEN. AND THEN CAME BACK. BUT. BUT THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA CREATES A HUGE. CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT GOES ALL THE WAY INTO THE VALLEY UP AND DOWN AND INCREASES TO THEM. RAISE UP OUR HOUSING COSTS AND CREATE LESS PLACES FOR OUR FOLKS TO BE ABLE LIVE WHO MAKE UP OFTENTIMES OF THE. UP AND A LOT LESS PEOPLE DO IN THE BAY AREA. SO ANY KIND OF WAY THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TO ADDRESS IS VERY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND I UNDERSTAND IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR ANYWHERE AROUND THE BAY AREA TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS OF IT HAS WHEN THE BAY AREA DOESN'T CONTINUE TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT A RATE. OF THE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD. YOU'RE ENTIRELY RIGHT AND I'LL SAY IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS THIS BILL IS AROUND IS THE STATUS QUO ACCEPTABLE OF THESE TWO OR FIFTY ACRES WHERE WE'RE NOT BUILDING ANY HOUSING AND ARE JUST SURFACE PARKING LOTS. OR SHOULD WE BUILD SOMETHING ON TOP OF THEM I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT IN A CAR IN A TARGETED WAY. AYE AND THE STATUS QUO DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BUT TO YOUR POINT. BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH HOUSING. WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE HIGH COST CENTERS OF THE CITIES IN THE BAY WERE DRIVING TWO THREE FOUR HOURS A DAY COMMUTING FROM YOUR PART OF THE STATE. UP WHO ARE OUR TEACHERS ARE CHILDCARE WORKERS ARE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE RETAIL WORKERS AND THAT'S NOT JUST A FUNCTION OF THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT IT EXACERBATES. THE CONGESTION CRISIS GREENHOUSE GASES WHAT THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW CARES ABOUT. ALRIGHT MR ACOSTA. I THINK YOU AYE YOU APPRECIATE THE OUT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT IN TRYING TO. DO SOMETHING. WE OFTEN STE STRUGGLE WITH THE DO SOMETHINGS IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE SEQUEL AMENDMENTS. AND EXEMPTIONS. PART LABOR WEEK IT SEEMS LIKE. WHICH IS A PART OF THE THE ISSUE WE ALSO HAVE A NIMBY ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE IT WHERE I LIVE. YOU KNOW WERE WERE A SUBURB OF LOS ANGELES IS NOT UNLIKE AT TINA TO ON MY COLLEAGUE PARA. FROM. STOCKINGS COMMENTS SAID IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE OVER PRICED HOUSING. YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE TRYING TO FLEET FOR A LOT OF REASONS BUT ONE OF THEM IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE ANYMORE. IF I TOLD YOU WHAT MY WIFE I PAID FOR FIRST CONDO THIRTY YEARS AGO HE'D BOY BOY DID DID BY TEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S CRAZY. BOB I HAVE A. ALTHOUGH I I. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH US I'VE SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WITH IT. OF. ONE OF THEM BEING. YOU'RE VESTING. BY THIS BILL BART TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR OWN PROPERTY WHICH IS GREAT. BUT. WHAT HAPPENS IF THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SAYS WE DON'T WANT IT? CAN YOU CAN YOU. ADDRESS THAT YEAH I MEAN AGAIN THIS IS A CHOICE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE REALITY IS THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS HAVE HAVE SAID NO HAVE SAID THEY WOULD PREFER TO SEE SERVICE PARKING LOTS. RATHER THAN MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS AND AND HOUSING AND RESTAURANTS AND WALKABILITY AROUND BART STATIONS AND. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THAT UP AND I AM OPEN TO ANY OTHER IDEAS TO TO THINK ABOUT IT BUT WE THOUGHT THIS WAS A MOST TAILORED AND TARGETED WAY TO DO THAT. TOTALLY. APPRECIATE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT NAME BE CULTURE THAT FRANKLY IS TAKING HOLD EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE THESE ISSUES FRANKLY IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL YOU KNOW ARE WE ARE WE SHOULD BUILD MORE HOUSING BUT. NOT NEXT DOOR TO ME OR NOT YOU KNOW HIGH DENSITY OR WE HAVE YOU WE HAD THE. SENATE BILL IT JUST RECENTLY AT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH WHICH IS SIMILAR IN IN VAIN STATEWIDE. BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT BAR. WHO? TO MY MIND. HAVING SERVED ON ON AN MPO. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST IN THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY. AND WORKED IN C. H. DE WORK AND TRANSPORTATION A COMMITTEES. I HAVE A REAL CONCERN WITH NOW AN AGENCY LIKE BART WHO DOESN'T DO HOUSING. NOW WHERE THEY GONNA GET THE EXPERTISE. THE AUTHORITY YOU'RE GONNA BEST IN THEM. AND HOW ARE THEY GOING TO WORK WITH THESE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THAT UP TO THIS POINT. DON'T WANT THIS THIS HOUSING WHICH THE COMMITTEE DOESN'T. IS THIS SOMEHOW. AND THEN RUN DIG TO GIVE SOME COVER FOR THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES I MEAN I'M ASK A TOUGH QUESTION HERE BECAUSE I WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER. AND SOMETIMES THOSE ARE WELCOME BUT NOT ALWAYS SO. THOSE ARE REALLY THE CHALLENGES THAT I'M HAVING WITH THIS I JUST WISH WE COULD TAKE A MUCH MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH. STATEWIDE STATE OF THESE GIANT MANDATES FROM ON HIGH AND SACRAMENTO SAYING YOU MUST DO THIS. INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT EVERYTHING HOLISTICALLY AND GETTING EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM AT TOUGH TO WORK WITH YOU WE WE TALKED LAST YEAR BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. WHEN WE WERE. HAD THAT ONE MEETING. I'D LOVE TO DO THAT BUT WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME IN THE STATE. IN GRAPPLING WITH ALL THESE ISSUES AND GETTING EVERYBODY TOGETHER WE ARE GETTING LABOR BUILDERS ENVIRONMENT COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW TRANSPORTATION SECTORS EVERYONE TOGETHER IN A ROOM AND GET THE SINKS HASHED OUT SO WERE WE HAD UP WITH THINGS LIKE THIS WE'RE TRYING TO PUT. HOUSING ON SURFACE PARKING LOTS AND YOU MIGHT BE GOING IT'S THE WILL OF THOSE ACTUAL COMMUNITY SO YOU'RE TRYING TO TO BENEFIT SO. I I APPRECIATE WE'RE COME FROM A PROBABLY ALCHEMY SPRINGER BUILDING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BUT I LOVE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO THOSE COUPLE OF ISSUES PARTICULARLY WITH THE BARK. UP HAVING ANY EXPERTISE IN THIS AT ALL IS ARE THEY GONNA CREATE MORE ARE THEY HIRE NEW PEOPLE TO DO IT YET SO SUBVERSIVE AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE A LONGER CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THIS I KNOW THERE'S A. TENSION BETWEEN WANTING TO SUPPORT LOCAL CONTROL BUT UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL CONTROL IS SOMETIMES. UP BLOCKING THE VERY TYPES OF SMART GROWTH THAT I THINK WE WANT AND THAT'S A CONSTANT TENSION THAT THAT WE ADDRESS SO FIRST OF ALL WITH REGARD TO WHAT PART WOULD DO BAR UNDER THIS BILL WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO SET. VERY BROAD TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ANOTHER WORKS UP WOULD BE ABLE TO SET AND AND AND THE AND THE GUIDELINES THAT THEY'RE SETTING ARE ALREADY OUT THERE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEY PASSED. OUR AROUND DENSITY AND HEIGHT AND PARKING BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD BE STILL CONTROLLED BY LOCALS IN FACT WE THIS BILL CAME OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. AND WE TOOK A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS EXACTLY THAT SO WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE LOCAL CONTROL FOR A LOT OF THOSE DETAILS. ON THIS BILL GIVES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TWO YEARS. UPDATE THEIR LOCAL ZONING TO ADDRESS THE THAT THE GENERAL PARAMETERS THAT PART SETS BUT THEN ALSO TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN LOCAL ZONING FOR THIS SO THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INPUT. OVER ESTHETICS DESIGN EXCEPT FOR. SOME AND THEN THE LAST MEAL SAY AND AND AGAIN WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM PART ON THIS IS PART HAS HAD A VERY LONG HISTORY. OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON THIS BUT WHAT WE FOUND OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS IS EITHER IN MOST OF THESE JURISDICTIONS THEY JUST SAID NO. OR THE HANDFUL OF JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE SAID YES. THE DEVELOPER HAS BEEN. STRUNG OUT FOR UP FOR LESS HOUSING AND AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR SMART GROWTH AND. OFTENTIMES THESE PROJECTS TOOK TEN TO TWENTY YEARS SO WE HAVE A CRISIS TODAY WERE TRYING TO ACCELERATE THAT AGAIN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN MORE OF A CONVERSATION. IT'S QUICK AND IT'S VERY VERY BRIEF FOLLOW UP THAT HER THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY. SEE QUIRK RELIEF IN THIS BILL AT ALL FOR THIS THIS TRANSIT PROP PROJECTS. THIS BILL. ALLOWS PART TO BASICALLY. TO TO MANAGE THAT SECRET PROCESS SO WE'RE SIMPLIFYING THE MATTER BUT TO YOUR POINT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT FUNDAMENTALES FUNDAMENTALLY IMPACTED SICK WHEN THE WEATHER AYE I SUSPECT YOU WOULD. BE WHAT YOU WANT WHY I THINK FROM JUST STRICTLY THE THAT THE. FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT SIDE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN I THINK WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE GERMANE TO THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE THEY CAN. DO ALL THE ENTITLEMENT THEY WANT WORK WITH THESE COMMITTEES COMMITTEES CAN SAY YES AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE COME IN WHO DOESN'T EVEN LIVE IN THE BAY AREA. AND SAY OH WE SHOULD DO THAT BECAUSE EXPIRES THE AND THAT YOU'RE STILL TALKING OR TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACOSTA I APPRECIATE THAT I DON'T THINK THE REST OF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE WANTED THIS BILL TO BE. THE SITE OF A FIGHT OVER WHETHER SEQUEL SHOULD INVOLVE MORE LESS LAWSUITS HE WANTED TO WANT TO LET THIS COMMITTEE RESOLVE THESE ISSUES IN WITH OTHER BILLS FOR JUST TRYING TO BUILD. A TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS OF HOUSE AROUND PART SIX. RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SAYING THAT. AS A MADE IT'S OUR SECOND. ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT. MISTER CHIU. I. APPRECIATE YOUR VERY CREATIVE. PROPOSAL HERE. CLEARLY FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. IT'S SMART GROWTH IT'S A HIGH DENSITY HOUSING AROUND EXISTING. RAIL TRANSIT. YOU HAVE A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE. YOU HAVE AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE. OFTEN THE BOARD BOARD. AND SO IN A SENSE IT'S REPLACE IT'S NOT TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL BUT. IT'S REPLACING ONE LOCAL CONTROL WITH ANOTHER FORM OF LOCAL CONTROL. I NORMALLY HAVE OF A VERY. I'M VERY PROTECTIVE OF LOCAL CONTROL IN AND A FOR THAT REASON I. GAVE A NON RECOMMENDATION FOR THE COMMITTEE. AS AS FAR AS YOUR BILL. BUT. AS TRYING TO THINK OF. ARGUMENT SO WHY SHOULD NOT VOTE FOR YOUR BILL AND I THINK YOU'VE ADDRESSED ALL OF THEM AND SO I WILL BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL THANK YOU RIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION WE'VE ALL HAD ABOUT THIS THESE ARE DIFFICULT TOPICS AND UP HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION ON IT BUT AGAIN. WE'VE REALLY TRIED TO NARROWLY TAILORED THIS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILL IS ABOUT ADDRESSING SUSTAINABILITY IN COMMUNITIES REDUCING CONGESTION GREENHOUSE GASES. ARE AND. AND AND MAKE SURE WE'RE DRESSING THE TWIN CRISES OF CONGESTION AND HOUSING AND THAT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOTIONS MADE AND SECONDED. MADAM SECRETARY. I DON'T TWENTY SEVEN AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY THREE BY MEMBERS CHU AND GRAYSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

STONE AYE SEVEN THREE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. NEXT WE HAVE. ITEM NUMBER THIRTY TWO MISS CHAVEZ A. B. AUTHORITY TWENTY SEVEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN. REALLY ENJOYED THAT LAST DISCUSSION BECAUSE. I HAVE A BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE TALKING EXACTLY ABOUT THE HOUSING PRICES. AND THE PROBLEM WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT AS LARGE AS DESTRUCTIVE PREVIOUS ONE BUT IT DEALS WITH IT NAY MORE. MONETARY WAY. CHICO IS A GOOD PROCESS THAT CAN BE ABUSED BY THOSE SEEKING TO. PAT THEIR OWN WALLETS RATHER THAN HONORABLE RESIDENTS. OR ORGANIZATIONS OF EVERY TRUE VESTED INTEREST IN THE DEVELOPMENT. AB THIRTY TWENTY SEVEN SIX TO PUT REGIONAL PARAMETERS AROUND. WHO CAN BE AWARDED ATTORNEY FEES WHEN INTERVENING IN THE SEQUEL PROCESS? BY NARROWING THE FIELD AROUND WHO GETS AWARDED ATTORNEY FEES. THOSE YOU LIVE NEARBY OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A TRACK RECORD. AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. WE CAN WEED OUT SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS THAT EXPLOIT CHICO. THIS BILL. DOES NOT NARROW WHO CAN INTERVENE IN THE PROCESS. SHIPLEY WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO COLLECT ATTORNEYS FEES. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE VALUE SEQUEL PROCESS AND DO NOT WANT TO DIMINISH THAT. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT SHE DOESN'T UP OPPORTUNITY TO GET RICH. OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES WHO EMPLOY OUR NEIGHBORS ARE NOW WORKING TO ALLEVIATE THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CRISIS. I WORKED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE IN CHAIR AND AMENDMENTS TO INCLUDE RENTERS. AND TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT NONPROFIT STATUS OF THOSE WHO CAN RECOUP THE FEES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR SOMETIME IN OUR DISTRICT CAPTURE MANY PEOPLE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF HER DECISION. I HAVE TWO MEMBERS. FROM FROM MY AREA ERIC FLOOR DYING. HE'LL BE MAKING HIS COMMENTS AND ALSO HIS LAWYER AND ANDREWS SKETCHY SEWER ERIC. GOOD AFTERNOON HARPER CHAIRMAN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME'S ERIK FLOW DEAN THAT REPRESENT STRAT EQUITY GROUP TO SPONSOR OF AB THREE OR TWO SEVEN. I'M A MEMBER OF THE URBAN LAND INSTITUTE DE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND A LIFE MEMBER OF THE SIERRA CLUB. OUR COMPANY STRAT EQUITY GROUP WAS STARTED BY THREE BROTHERS WHO IMMIGRATED FROM MEXICO. TO CALIFORNIA. THE FOUNDERS MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO LEAVE THEIR HOME. TO ESCAPE THE RAMPANT GRAFT AND OTHER FORMS OF EXTORTION THAT THEY SUFFERED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THEIR BUSINESS THERE. THEY'RE STRONG FAMILY VALUES IN THEIR STRONG JEWISH FAITH WOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO TOLERATE THE EXTORTION TACTICS ANY LONGER SO HE MOVED TO UNITED STATES AND STARTED AGAIN WITH A SMALL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY. WHICH HAS SINCE GROWN TO OVER FIFTY CALIFORNIANS. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE TO OUR COMPANY FOUNDERS TO ONCE AGAIN ENCOUNTERING NEW FORM OF EXTORTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS TIME UNDER THE DISGUISE OF SEQUEL. WHAT'S WORSE IS THE PRACTICE IS NOT CURRENTLY ILLEGAL. WE WORK FOR OVER THREE YEARS ON A SPECIFIC PROJECT WITH THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AT THE NEIGHBORS AND THE CITY ON UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED MIXED USE PROJECT COMPRISED OF A NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL CENTER. AND WORKFORCE HOUSING. WITH NO LOCAL OPPOSITION. SO FOLLOWING UNANIMOUS APPROVAL WE RECEIVED A LEGAL CHALLENGE FROM A QUORUM CALL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUP THATWAS FORMED CO FOUNDED BY SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN ARIZONA AND SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THIRTY MILES AWAY FROM OUR PROJECT. THEY CLAIMED THAT OUR PROJECT E. I. R. AGAIN WHICH WAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED. WAS INADEQUATE AND REQUESTED THE ADDITION OF TWO ADDITIONAL MITIGATION MEASURES AND A PAYMENT OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THESE MITIGATION MEASURES WERE WINDOW DRESSING FOR THE REAL REASON FOR THE LAWSUIT AND THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED ANY OF THE PROJECTS ALREADY LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. SO AFTER MONTHS OF MEETINGS AND PHONE CALLS WITH THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS WE GAVE THEM A CHOICE. WE CAN INCORPORATE THE TO MITIGATION MEASURES AND THEN PAY THEM A SETTLEMENT OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR WE COULD PAY THEM A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH NO MITIGATION. AS YOU MIGHT GUESS. THEY CHOSE TO A SETTLEMENT TO POCKET A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NO MEDICATION NO PROJECT CHANGES BECAUSE NONE WERE NEEDED. SO WE HAD TO GO ON REYES A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PAY THEM OFF. MILITARY THERE'S ANOTHER SMALL% COMPANY THAT WE KNOW OF THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY OFF THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT AND SO WITH THEIR SETTLEMENT REQUIRES THE DONATION OF TWO RESIDENTIAL LOTS. AS PAYMENT CARRASQUILLO TRY TO WRAP UP YES SIR SO THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING. THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CITIZENS SEEM ETHICAL MORAL OR LEGAL TO YOU. WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT THIS IS THE TERM THAT COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ELECTED LEGISLATURE INTENDS FOR THESE OUT OF TOWN BAD ACTORS TO CONTINUE TO REAP FINANCIAL WINDFALL. FURTHER FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT THE ABILITY OF CONCERNED LOCAL CITIZENS AND LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENT ORGANIZATIONS FROM CHALLENGING PROJECTS ON SEQUEL GROUNDS. SO IN AND REFERENCE OF TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU HEARD A REAL FACE ON THIS REAL ISSUE AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. TO ME THIS IS AND. BUT IT AND ENTER SKETCHY WITH OFFER INVEST FESTING KRIEGER. THIS ONE TO CLARIFY ITS BEEN EXPLAINED THOROUGHLY BUT THIS BILL WOULD NOT PROHIBIT ANY LAWSUIT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT WOULD SIMPLY DISCOURAGE THOSE THAT SEEK TO USE EQUAL FOR ECONOMIC GAIN. VERSES THE REAL REASON PERCY CHO WAS A WHICH IS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. GOOD AFTERNOON NEARLY COVERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I ASSISTANCE AMONG THE OFFICE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS PER. P. MONTGOMERY FOR THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OF PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE JOINS US HERE OF CALIFORNIA AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY I'M I WOULD NOTE THAT. THAT ATTORNEYS FEES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR PREVAILING PARTIES IN SEQUEL LAWSUITS. AND SO THOSE ARE FOR CASES THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH ON THE MERITS AND THERE'S BEEN A FULL OF JUDGMENT AND SO CASES INVOLVING SETTLEMENTS WOULDN'T BE COVERED BY THE SPELL. IS THAT COVERED UNDER THIS BILL BUT I I THINK WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT ANY GROUPS OUT THERE WHO ARE LOOKING TO. SUE TO ENFORCE THE PUBLIC'S RIGHTS TO HAVE. A LIVABLE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT. MIGHT BE DISCOURAGED BY THIS BILL OFF FOR SOME CASES YOU HAVE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WORK FOR NONPROFITS WHO WILL TAKE CASES. PROVIDED THAT THEY. ONLY ON THE CONDITION THAT THEY GET ATTORNEY'S FEES THEY WENT UP AND SO FOR SOME ORGANIZATIONS THIS WOULD BE. LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE LAW TO ENFORCE THE RIGHT OR MAKE IT HARDER TO FIND ATTORNEY. MEANING THAT THOSE WHO JUST CAN'T AFFORD ACCESS TO JUSTICE WILL LOSE THAT RIGHT. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE POST AND ASKED FOR AND ABOUT THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SORRY MATTHEW BAKER PLANNING CONSERVATION THE COULD. WE ARE IN OPPOSITION FOR THE RESEARCH JUST ABOUT HEAR CLAPPING. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ME AS MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ASSEMBLYMAN CHáVEZ I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WE SEE A NUMBER OF BILLS COME THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT TRY TO NIBBLE AT THE EDGES OF SEQUEL TRY TO DO SOME SORT OF REFORM I THINK. MOST PEOPLE THE LEGISLATURE AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT. ALTHOUGH WE SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN THEEFFORTS REMAIN UNSUCCESSFUL IN THAT IS UNFORTUNATE THIS BILL IS I THINK GETS TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM WITH WITH A SEQUIN BEAST THAT WE SEE IN THIS STATE WHICH IS THESE ATTORNEYS. WHO GO FROM CITY TO CITY IN FROM DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENT LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET A CHECK? WE'VE ALL SEEN IT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE COUNTY SUPERVISORS ARE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS PARTY COMING HERE WE ALL KNOW EVERYONE HAS THE GROUP. THAT THE ATTORNEYS WHO TRAVEL IN A PACK AND THEY GO IN THE SO IN THE SUIT THESE DEVELOPMENTS OURS WAS RAY JOHNSON. IN OUR AREA YOU KNOW THEY JUST GO ROUND AND THEY SAY. EITHER YOU. HAND THIS OVER SOME MONEY OR WE'RE GONNA STOP YOUR DEVELOPMENT COST YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES. UP UNTIL YOU FINALLY SAY UNCLE AND GIVE US WHAT WE WANT AND ITS ITS ITS PASSED TO STOP. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYERS IN THE CITIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO BRING DEVELOPMENT INTO THE CITY'S WEATHERS. AT RESIDENTIAL OR WHETHER IT'S COMMERCIAL. THEY END UP PAYING THE COST WHICH IS WHICH IS WRONG WHILE THESE ATTORNEYS WHO WANT TO SEE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROJECTS. SIT BACK FAT AND HAPPY. GETTING RICH OFF THE BACKS OF THE AVERAGE CITIZEN SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH THAT I MOVE THE BILL. MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR I REALIZE THAT SEEK WAYS IN PERFECT. I SUPPORT EFFORTS TO TO STREAMLINE AND AND LOOK AT THAT WAYS I PROPOSED SOMETHING THIS COMMITTEE. LAST YEAR TWO YEARS AGO. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS IS THAT IS LOOKING FOR WHAT YOUR TESTIMONY. I GOT AS ONE ASK YOU A QUESTION SO THAT I THINK THERE IS A CLARIFICATION FROM THE. OPPOSITION THAT IT'S NOT JUST. SETTLEMENTS AS ACTUAL JUDGMENTS. BUT UP ON THE ANALYSIS IT TALKS ABOUT THAT. THERE'S A THRESHOLD IT'S NOT JUST THAT THERE'S THERE'S PROOF THAT THERE. THERE WERE FEES AT STAKE BUT THERE HAS TO BE. A FINDING OF A ABOUT PUBLIC BENEFIT SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC BENEFIT SO. SURE LIKE CANADA THAT THAT FOCUSES ON THAT THERE'S MONEY AND THE HOUSE TO BE A A PREVAILING BENEFIT TO THE PUBLIC AND SO. WHY IS NOT THAT NOT ADDRESS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL THANK VERY MUCH RUG? SOMEWHERE MCCARTY YOU BRING THAT UP BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE LIKE TO DRESS FUNNY DO THAT SHORT YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A JUDGE TO LOOK AT WHETHER FEEDBACK THAT SPEAK TO THE MY SHORT UNDER THE EXISTING LAW. THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE JUDGE TO LOOK AT THE PETITIONERS AND. A CASE IN DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC BENEFIT THE PROBLEM THAT ARISES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT IS WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH A BROAD THINK IT IMPACTS EVERYBODY SO JUDGES HAVE STRUGGLED AND THERE ARE VARYING. DEGREES OF. RESULTS ON THESE CASES BECAUSE THE JUDGE LOOKS AT A ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSUITS AS WELL DOESN'T THAT EMPIRE MEANT IMPACT EVERYBODY YOU'RE YOU'RE PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT A LOT OF THESE LAWSUITS ARE PURELY FOR PRIVATE GAIN AND THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S DIFFICULT. FOR THE JUDGES TO WEIGH THAT AND I'D. FEEL AS THOUGH THIS WOULD GIVE THEM MORE DIRECTION AS TO WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE. FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC BENEFIT VERSUS THE PRIVATE BENEFIT. MR AGO ACOSTA. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISS CHAVEZ I'LL SECOND THE MOTION BY THE WAY FOR THE RECORD. YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL STRUGGLE WITH THIS AND IN OUR DISTRICTS I I'VE BROUGHT UP IN THIS COMMITTEE. LOCAL. PROJECT TWENTY YEARS IN THE MAKING REVIEW REVISE THE LAST FIVE YEARS FRESH CIR. BYE BYE AND FROM ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS THE NEIGHBORHOODS CALTRANS BECAUSE IT'S ADJACENT TO A FREEWAY YOU KNOW YOU NAME IT. ALL KINDS OF SETTLEMENTS BROKE FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE WANTS THE ENVIRONMENT TO SUFFER ONE IOTA WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND I WOULD PERSONALLY LIKE TO SEE. OUR THESE LAWSUITS BEING ADDRESSED AND WE HAVE A REAL SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE DOING THAT. THE THAT I AM AND FOR TO THE KYLE. JOHN SAID FROM SIERRA CLUB SAT DOWN. AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME BACK A FEW LIKE BUT BUT I I DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL YOU OUT MISS JONES BUT. I DON'T I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW. IN THIS THIS CASE AND IN THE THREE HUNDRED A SYDNEY THE. THE MILLION MULTIMILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT THAT A LOCAL DEVELOPER FOR IT MAKES USE PROJECT JUST RECEIVED. WITH BOGUS MITIGATION I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IT'S THERE'S NOTHING HERE TO MITIGATE AND YET THEY WANT MONEY AND THEY'RE EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION AS A THREE PERSON LAW FROM FROM SAN BERNADINO. THAT HAS IT WOULD HAVE A HUNDRED MILES FROM THE SENATE RATE OF ALLEY AND THEY POP UP OUT OF NO WHERE DAYS BEFORE YOU KNOW PLAYED SPORTS TO BE TURNED. THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO START GETTING AND WHETHER IT'S THIS BILL OR THE NEXT BILL I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT SOME KIND OF MOVEMENT BECAUSE WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT NOT BRIBIE HERE. HOPEFULLY NOT. BUT I'LL PROBABLY BE HERE MANY YEARS FROM NOW DEALING WITH THE SAME ISSUE AND I HOPE WE CAN COME TO AGREEMENT I HER I CAN I COUNT MULTIPLE VOTES. FROM THIS DAIS THAT WANT TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE SO I WELCOME. MY COLLEAGUES SAID WHO HAVE SAID THAT USED TO SIT DOWN AND NOW WILL WILL ORDER SOME PIZZA AND. GET SOME SODAS AND COFFEE AND AND START TO HASH THIS THING OUT BUT I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT. FRANKLY. IT'S. LONG TIME COMING. THAT WE DO SOMETHING ON THIS ISSUE IN HERE WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW IMMIGRANTS. WHO YOU KNOW WORKING THAT TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM AND WHAT THEY ARE BEING STIFLED AT EVERY TURN SO? THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AND AT THE FLEA BE SPORTING A BUILDING. THANK YOU MISTER STONE. THANK YOU SEE GOOD TENDS TO. SO ALWAYS BE A BIT OF A. A WHIPPING BOY IN IN THESE CASES BUT THERE'S SOME. COMPONENTS OF IT THAT ARE REALLY CRITICAL IN A LOT OF. THE SEEK REFORM NOTIONS THAT COME AROUND. REALLY DO. NOTHING BUT TAKE THE PUBLIC INTO AND TAKE THAT THE EXPANSIVE PROCESS AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC CANCER IF WE. GO AFTER THE ATTORNEY'S FEES HERE WHICH WHICH IS FAIRLY CAREFULLY CRAFTED. IN SEEK WORK AND IT THE. THOSE WHO ARE. FILING SUIT DON'T ALWAYS GET ATTORNEY SEES IN THESE CASES. AND HAVING BEEN A LOCAL ELECTED DONE A NUMBER OF OF LAND USE. ITEMS THAT SOMETIMES GET THE SIX OKAY SOMETIMES NOT GET TO SEE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE'RE TAKING A COME APART COMPONENT AGAINST. THE PUBLIC OUT OF THAT THE QUESTION HERE BECAUSE IF WE IF THEY WE DON'T GIVE ATTORNEYS FEES WHEN THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE BROUGHT A SUIT. REGARDLESS OF ALL OF THE OTHER HYPE AROUND THAT THE SEQUEL LAWSUITS THEN THAT'S GONNA HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CHILLING EFFECTS ON THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO WEIGH IN ON A CASE. PLENTY OF JURISDICTIONS GET THEMSELVES IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO THINGS LIKE ALTERNATE IS ANALYSES AND OFTENTIMES THAT NO ONE ELSE IS THAT THE THAT THE. JURISDICTION WANTS SHINES THROUGH AND THE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE PRESENTED ARE GIVEN REALLY SHORT SHRIFT THAT IS ONE OF THE IN THE AREAS WHERE. THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL ON AND MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS THAT I SEE. OFTEN COME BACK AROUND AND EVERYBODY AGREES IN THE END WHEN THE SETTLEMENT IS THERE THAT ALL THIS IS A BETTER PROJECT AND IT'S A BETTER PROJECT. BECAUSE. IT HAD THE JURISDICTION ULTIMATELY LISTENING TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE THERE SOMETIMES IN THOSE CASES TOURNEY SEES IT AWARD SOMETIMES NOT SORT OF DEPENDS ON. ON THE OVERALL CIRCUMSTANCE AND THAT'S WHERE STRUGGLE WITH ON THIS BILL. IS SENDING THAT MESSAGE OUT TO THE PUBLIC THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO BRING SUITS THEN ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE THE MONEY TO BRING SEE BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD THE THE LEGAL FEES. AND. IT'S A WAY OF OF BALANCING THE INTERESTS IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THOSE NEIGHBORS FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WHO DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE MONEY THAT'S A WHOLE NOTION BEHIND. ATTORNEY'S FEES PROVISIONS ESPECIALLY IN THESE CASES WHERE IT IS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS. IS ACTING SO THERE MAY BE THINGS WE CAN DO AROUND SEQUEL BUT BUT IN THIS CASE I MEAN THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT. ON EXACTLY THE NEIGHBORHOOD KIND NEIGHBORHOOD CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE SO I'M I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAVEZ WAS LIKE CLOSE ITS I LIKE BREAKABLE COMMENTS TO THE. I'M NOT LOOKING TO MAKE IN SEQUEL WHIPPING BOY. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE. IN AS FAR AS IT BEING CAREFULLY CRAFTED. YOU JUST HEARD. ERIC MAKE THE GAVE YOUR TRUE STORY WHERE IT'S NOT BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED. A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EXTORTION ON A PROJECT IS NOT A CAREFULLY CRAFTED ENVIRONMENT. YOU'RE WE THE AMENDMENTS WE MADE HERE. WE WE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIVE ONE C. THREE AGENCY FOR. HE'S ARE COVERS HERE EARLIER THAT WASN'T A MAN WE JUST TOOK WEEK GO CAN YOU SAID YOU'RE RIGHT WE WANT YOU TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS. YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE. I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR TO EVERYBODY IN THIS ASSEMBLY EVER I KNOW ALL YOU MEMBERS HERE. HAVEN'T SEEN ME GIVEN NUMBERS SPEECHES ON THIS I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT. MY ACTUALLY MEMBER THE LITTLE BUYER MIDDLE CAUCUS SO DECISION NOT. I'M NOT SOME CRAZED INDIVIDUAL IS GOING AFTER THE ENVIRONMENT. THE HEARING YOU HAD BEFORE. IN A HEARING YOU HAVING RIGHT NOW. DEALS WITH THE ISSUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DELUDE MONEY. WHEN HE HAS TO PAY A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO SOMEBODY. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING HE'S GONNA TAKE OUT OF HIS POCKET THAT'S WHAT WAS GOING TO GO THE COST OF THAT HOUSE. IN THOSE THOSE PROJECTS. WE THIS IS A VERY SMALL MOVEMENT. TO MAKE HOUSES MORE AFFORDABLE. I'D ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAVEZ SITE. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. YOUR YOUR LEAD WITNESSES SO PERSONAL STORY AND I I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THERE WERE NOT FOR WHO WE ARE AGAINST EXTORTIONIST LAWSUITS AND THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO TRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS. TO UP CUT DOWN ON IS EXTORTIONIST. LAWSUITS HOWEVER THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE AS MR STONE INDICATED IS. YOU KNOW DAY BYE BYE. LIMITING THE CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT CAN RECOVER ATTORNEY'S FEES WHEN OFTEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLE GUYS. AND AND AND THE LITTLE GIRLS IT OF OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY. WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN BRING? SEQUEL LAWSUITS IS THROUGH THE ATTORNEY FEES. THAT WHILE I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION YOU YOU THE MANAGER BILL TO INCLUDE TENANTS. TWO ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I HAD RAISED BUT. NO I I THINK THERE OTHERS. YOU KNOW. SMALLER ENVIRONMENTAL OR COMMUNITY GROUPS TO START THAT. THAT WOULD BE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TO BE ABLE TO BRING LEGITIMACY QUILL LAWSUITS. AND SO. THE PROBLEM IS REAL. BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT YOUR PROPOSED SOLUTION HERE TODAY AND FOR THAT REASON I'M WRECKING RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE. WITH THAT. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM THIRTY TWO A. B. THIRTY TWENTY SEVEN BY MEMBER CHáVEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI NOW ROUTES IF YOU KNOW ACOSTA AYE ACOSTA AYE CHAU. SHOWN UP VOTING. EGGMAN. EGGMAN NOT VOTING. FLORA. FLORA KILEY MON. MCCARTY. MCCARTY NO MELENDEZ. LINDA'S AYE VARIOUS. REYES NOT VOTING STONE. STONE NO. THREE THREE A RIGHT IN THE BILL'S ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MAKE YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WE HAVE. ITEM THIRTY FIVE MS RUBIO A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVENTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ABSENCE OF AVAILABLE MARKET REQUIRED FOR WASTE DIVERSION OF RECYCLED MATERIALS. EARLIER THIS YEAR CHINA IMPOSE NEW STRICT POLICIES LIMITING RECYCLABLE IMPORTS AND PLACING OUTRIGHT BANS ON MIXED PAPER AND VARIOUS PLASTICS. THIS HAS RATES GREAT CONCERNS BECAUSE CHINA HAD BEEN THE LARGEST WORLD MARKET FOR MANY OF OUR RECYCLABLE PRODUCTS. SOMETHING THE CALIFORNIA LAW DID NOT ANTICIPATE AND THAT CURRENTLY DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES EACH LOCAL JURISDICTION TO DIVERT FIFTY PERCENT OF SOLID WASTE BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONALLY LAW DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE DISPOSAL OF RECYCLABLE MATERIALS BUT THAT'S EXPOSED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CIVIL PENALTIES. IF THEY'RE DISPOSABLE DISPOSAL ACTIVITY LEADS THEM TO DIVERT LEFT IN THE REQUIRED FIFTY PERCENT UNLESS THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE TO HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO DO SO. HOWEVER EXISTING NOT DOES NOT LIST A RECYCLABLE RECYCLABLES MARKET FAILURE AMONG THE CRITERIA THAT CAL RECYCLE SHOULD CONSIDER IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ISSUE A COMPLIANCE ORDER OR IF THE ABSENCE OF A MARKET CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A GOOD. FAITH EFFORT THE LAW ALSO DOES NOT TAKE MARKET FAILURE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN REQUIRING FIFTY PERCENT DIVERSION OR DURING THE ISSUING OF CIVIL PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO MEET THE FIFTY PERCENT I VERSION. MY BILL AB THIRTY ONE SEVENTY EIGHT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE BY ALLOWING A JURISDICTION TO TEMPORARILY ARRANGE AND DISPOSE OF MATERIALS IF IT IS NECESSARY TO DO SO UNDER EXISTING LAW. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE TEMPORARY PROTECTION FOR LOCAL AGENCIES FROM IF ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR CIVIL PENALTIES PENALTIES WHEN THEY NEED TO DISPOSE OF EXCESS MATERIALS OCCURS EVERY IS AS A RESULT OF MARKET FAILURE. WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO IS REPEAL OR THREATEN EXISTING LAW OR CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS TO RECYCLE MATERIALS? IT ALSO DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECT RELIEF TO HAULERS OR TO WASTE RECYCLERS BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT UNDER AB NINE THIRTY NINE IS DIRECTED TOWARDS LOCAL AGENCIES NOT TO THE CONTRACTORS. WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO IS TAKE THE ABSENCE OF AVAILABLE MARKETS INTO ACCOUNT BY ESTABLISHING A TEMPORARY MEASURE TO ADDRESS UNPREDICTABLE AN UNSUSPECTING STABLE WORLD MARKETS FOR OUR MATERIALS? I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IN GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE I WILL ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. THESE AMENDMENTS ARE REQUIRING CAP BIKEL TO CONSIDER EFFORTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE MADE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE RICH AND. REMOVE CONTAMINANTS FROM RECYCLED MATERIALS WHEN MAKING A DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT. ALSO REMOVING SUBPARAGRAPH SEE FROM FORTY ONE SEVEN EIGHT ZERO POINT ZERO TWO WHICH WOULD STRIKE THE FIVE YEAR SUNSET THAT WOULD PROTECT LOCAL AGENCIES FROM PENALTIES. UNDER AB NINE THIRTY NINE REMOVE REMOVING REFERENCE TO THE STATE'S FIFTY PERCENT DIVERSION. REQUIREMENT BY STRIKING OUTLINES FIVE THROUGH TWELVE ON PAGE FOUR OF THE BILL I AM ALSO PREPARED TO ACCEPT. THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT MARKETS MAY BE MAY BE CONSIDERED AN COMPLIANCE ORDER DETERMINATIONS AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO MAKE SURE THAT I GET I COULD THAT PRESENT THE BILL THAT WOULD. PLEASE THE. THE COMMITTEE. HERE TO TESTIFY AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I HAVE WITNESSES OUT KELLY ASKED ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU IS RUBIO A MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KELLY ASTRO BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL. I TOO AM GRATEFUL FOR A LOT OF THE. GUIDANCE GIVEN TO US BY COMMITTEE STAFF AND THERE'S A VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS YOU KNOW. AS I PREPARED FOR TODAY'S HEARING AT ONE POINT IN TIME A LARGE PART OF MY REMARKS WAS ME DEVOTED OUTLINED THE PROBLEM I'M HOPING. WILL UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH THE SIGNIFICANCE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT. WE'RE SEEING AN UNPRECEDENTED MARKET FAILURE WE BENT DOES THE LAW SOME OF US WERE AROUND TWENTY SEVEN YEARS GOING AB NINE THIRTY NINE PASSED. THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND IT'S NOT CALIFORNIA ALONE IS NOT THE WEST COAST ALLIANCE NOT AUSTRALIA IT'S EVERYBODY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MATERIALS WERE GOING TO A PLACE AND NO LONGER ACCEPTS MUCH OF WHAT THEY WERE ACCEPTING. SO ALWAYS TELLING COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRY TO IMPROVE PRODUCT QUALITY THEIR SWORDS SLOWING THE SORTING LINES ARE PRETTY EQUIPMENT ALL THESE THINGS IN ANTICIPATION TRYING TO MEET THE NEW NEED. AND TO SOME EXTENT THEIR SUCCESSFUL BUT THERE'S A PART THAT THEY CANNOT CONTROL. IT TOOK TO PUT IT DOWN DO IS STEP WAS TERMS IT DISTILLS THIS WAY. WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT MATERIALS WILL CONTINUE TO PROCESS SOME TO INTEGRITY. WILL WORK DILIGENTLY TO IDENTIFY MARKETS BUT FOR THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE DESPITE THOSE EFFORTS THERE IS NO MARKET. OUR APPEAL TO YOU TODAY IS TO GET GIVE US SOME RELIEF AND HOW IS THE AUTHOR INDICATED WITH A NEW SET OF AMENDMENTS WE'VE AGREED TO IN CONCEPT. I WOULD HAVE LANGUAGE REFER TO COURSE YET BUT. THERE'S NO LONGER ANY AFFIRMATIVE RELIEF IN THE BILL THE RELIEF FROM PENALTY PROVISION IS ONE OF THE. AMENDMENTS THAT. ONE OF THE. PROVISIONS OF VOTES COMING OUT SO WHAT'S LEFT. THERE ARE TWO AREAS IN LAW CURRENTLY WERE CAL RECYCLE FOLLOWS A LIST OF CRITERIA IN MAKING DECISIONS. ONE OF THOSE HAS TO DO WITH A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TERMINATION. AND THE SECOND ONE WHICH FOLLOWS THAT YOU'RE NOT FOUND TO BE A GOOD FAITH THE CALVIN CYCLE THEN DECIDES BASED ON CERTAIN CRITERIA. WHETHER OR NOT A COMPLIANCE ORDER WILL ISSUE. WHAT THIS BILL ASKS IS THAT IN EITHER IN BOTH CASE BOTH CASES MARKETS BE CONSIDERED? NOW WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO ASSUME THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ANYWAY AND I WOULD CONCEDE WITH THE POINT RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT TO DATE. COVER CYCLES NEVER MISTREATED US. BUT HERE'S WHAT'S DIFFERENT THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM IS UNPRECEDENTED. IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE WE HAD A WASTE BOARD WE MIGHT HAVE APPEALED TO HAD THERE BEEN A PROBLEM WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENT WANTED TO DO. AND SO IF IT'S OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION BUT BECAUSE WE'RE CHARTING NEW TERRITORY HERE WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE. THAT MARKETS BE CONSIDERED CAL RECYCLE STILL RETAINS ALL DISCRETION IS DAMN MUCH WEIGHT THEY GIVE TO THESE CRITERIA WE SIMPLY WANT TO ADD THIS TO THE LIST. AND ARE THERE SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT DISS BILL AFFECT DIVERSE ARE NOT NO IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT COUNTS IS DISPOSABLE. VERSES DIVERSION. DOESN'T IT JUST A FIFTY PERCENT REQUIREMENT WAS ALWAYS DIRECTED TOWARD ENFORCEMENT AS A RESULT OF THE LAST SET OF AMENDMENTS WERE NOW DOWN TO JUST. HAVING MARKETS IDENTIFIED ON THE CRITERIA LISTS. AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE DRIVE VOTE. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PREY ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. AND FOR THE REASONS STATED BY KELLY ASTOR AND BY THE AUTHOR WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT CARE MARTINSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN CAPULET REPRESENTING SEE OUR NARN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MELISSA MELISSA CHAYTOR ENTRY ON BEHALF THE SOLID WASTE ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA OR SUPPORTIVE IN CONCEPT. AND ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN POSTURE WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY IN STRONG SUPPORT. I JOIN OF THEIR BILL ON BEHALF AT THEN SERVICES ALSO SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS I'M AARON EVANS ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. THE LEAGUE HAS TAKEN A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION ON THE SPELL LARGELY BECAUSE WE'D REALLY LIKE TO ENGAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. HOW MARKETS MIGHT BE DEVELOPED REALLY APPRECIATE THE THE MEASURE I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU? THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE. WERE WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS IT WAS IN PRINT ARMED WITH THESE AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE REMOVING. OUR OPPOSITION I I GUESS I'M INTERESTED IN. UNDERSTANDING THE THE. THE DETAILS OF THOSE AMENDMENTS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS IT YOU KNOW AS THE AS THE AUTHORS STATED WE ARE IN A CRISIS. AND WE THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN RECYCLING CALIFORNIA LOCAL GOVERNMENT PRIVATE SECTOR RECYCLER ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE TO BE WORKING TOGETHER. TO IMPROVE MARKETS AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO INVEST MORE IN THE PROCESSING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THOSE MARKETS. THAT SHOULD BE OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND THIS IS POTENTIALLY A VEHICLE FOR DOING THAT BOMB. WE DON'T NEED TO BE RETHINKING THE FIFTY PERCENT WE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE SPONSORS AS TO WHAT THEIR INITIAL LANGUAGE DID. BUT I BELIEVE THAT WITH THESE AMENDMENTS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION AND FOCUS ON THE COLLECTIVE WORK OF DEVELOPING THAT THE NECESSARY AND USE MARKETS AND THE RESOURCES FOR PROCESSING MATERIAL. SO THAT WE CAN RECYCLE IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA CREATE THE JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE SO AT THIS POINT. BUT I'M NOT. I AYE I BOMBING TRUSTING THAT THE CHAIR TO INTERPRET WHAT THE. AUTHOR'S INTENT WAS. SIR ANY ANY IF YOU CAN NO I REMAINED AT THE TABLE. LOOS LIKE WE MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ADDRESSED TO YOU ARE THERE ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GENEVIEVE AVEDON BICU ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOVING COALITION INCLUDING HEAL THE BAY SURFRIDER AND OTHERS. ALSO WERE IN OPPOSITION AND WILL BE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS AND THE CONSIDERING THINK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RAYOS THEM AS EGGMAN. FIRST I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS MAKES EVERYTHING MUCH EASIER. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FROM THE CALVET LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. SHE LEAVE. HAS THAT THAT THEY WERE IN OPPOSITION HAS OPPOSITION BEEN REMOVED. I TALK TO JENNA TEN MINS AGO SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE REMOVING OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MS EGGMAN. I THINK YOU I WANNA. I WANNA THANK THE THE AUTHOR FOR THE HARD WORK WE WE TALKED EARLIER TODAY AND WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH MR ASK TO HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION. I'M EVEN JUST MY CONCERN ABOUT COUNTING THAT AS AS A AS PART OF THE FIFTY PERCENT. AND I I HAVE AND WILL HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M SWEATING EMBARRASSED HONEST IS OUR RECYCLING AND I UNDERSTAND. THAT. THE HOLLERS AND THE PROCESSORS ARE ON THE END OF THAT STRING. AND THEY DON'T GET A SAY IN IN THE MARKET PART OF IT. SO I I I I I I I I I I UNDERSTAND THAT. SINCE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS AND RECYCLING THAT'S BEEN MY ONE THING WE HAVE TO CREATE OUR OWN MARKETS I WAS SAYING SINCE. EARLY TWO THOUSANDS DOES NOT GONNA WANT ADDRESS PERSON WELL IT'S YOU KNOW IT IT HERE IT IS IT'S HAPPENED AND BUT WE ALL HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS. COMMIT THINK WE WE STILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR TRASH CLEANER. ON A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH OUR TIPPING FEE IN OUR SINGLE STREAM AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATED ISSUES. BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE'S A CRISIS RIGHT NOW AND THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TAKE SOME STEPS I APPRECIATE THE SUNSET. APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS YOU'VE TAKEN AND A MOVE THE BILL. ALRIGHT. MOST OF THEM MADE AND SECONDED TO MS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WONDER IF I CAN GET THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES BACK UP TO THE MICROPHONES THAT I COULD. JUST. ASK FOR SOME CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU. SO IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY YOU SAID THIS WAS A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES BUT I DIDN'T. HERE WHAT AMENDMENT IT WISE THAT YOU WANTED. THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES THE REMAINS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR RECYCLING GOALS OF THE STATE. AND SO THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REQUESTED. ARE TO. INCLUDED SUNSET DATE WHICH I UNDERSTAND. I'LL BE TAKING A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS. AS THEY COME ACROSS. SO THE SUNSET DATE. ADDRESSING A MECHANISM TO ADDRESS MARKETS INSIDE LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THE SPONSORS AND ALL OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT. AS WELL AS FUNDING TO HELP ADDRESS MARKETS. OKAY THANK YOU. THAT. SO. ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO I WANNA. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT I HAD JUST RECENTLY HAD WITH THE WASTE HAULERS IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT THE FACT THAT. CHINA DOESN'T WANT IT ANYMORE RIGHT SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT STOCK IN WAREHOUSES WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT AND THIS IS A MAJOR. PROBLEM. AND AND I COMMEND YOU FOR YOU KNOW BRINGING FORWARD A BILL THAT AT LEAST. AT ADDRESSES IT IN A IN A PRAGMATIC WAY AND THIS ISN'T THE END OF THE DISCUSSION OBVIOUSLY BUT WE DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING I THINK YOU HEARD. I THINK EVERYONE HEARD SOME PRETTY GOOD POINTS MADE BY YOUR WITNESSES AS TO WHY WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS. SO WITH THAT I KNOW THAT I BELIEVE THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED. BUT I I'M HAPPY SPREE ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TOM IS RUBIO AYE AS WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD. I ALLEN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE. ACCEPTED ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS IT IS THAT INCLUDE PAGE FIVE THEY ANNOUNCES. PAGE FIVE. THE PROVISION IN THE ONE TWO THREE FOURTH PARAGRAPH THAT ONE. SUBPARAGRAPH SEES ISN'T THE SPONSOR IS RECOMMENDING THAT SUBPARAGRAPH C. BE REMOVED. WHICH IS SAD LINES THIRTEEN THROUGH EIGHTEEN I'M ON PAGE FOUR MISTER CHAIR. I'M ACTUALLY REFERRING TO PAGE FIVE PARAGRAPH. IN THE ANNOUNCES PARAGRAPH FOR THE COMMITTING. IS RECOMMENDING. THE AMENDMENT TO REQUIRE CAL RECYCLE TO CONSIDER EFFORTS THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE MADE TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF A REMOVE CONTAMINANTS. FROM RECYCLED MATERIALS WHEN MAKING A DETERMINATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT YES. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS RUBIO FLORA MISTER CHAIRMAN I FORGIVE ME SIR MAY I JUST CLARIFY ONE THING. WITH THAT SUBPARAGRAPH SEE ON PAGE FOUR OF THE BILL COMING OUT THE SUNSET ONE ALSO COME OUT AT THIS POINT IS THAT WAS THE PROVISION. WE WERE SAN SETTING ALL THE REMAINS OF THAT SECTION OF THE BILL FORMER SECTION TO ARE THE SIX FINDINGS IS TO CLARIFY THAT WAS STAFF THOSE DON'T SUNSET. THANK YOU. RIGHT WHAT THINK YOU THAT THANK YOU MISTER TERRY I AM JUST A YOU KNOW FOR CLARIFICATION THE REASON THAT THIS CAME ABOUT AS I WAS DOING SOME. SOME VISITING IN AND OUR. LOCAL HAULERS AND AND IT'S IT'S A CRISIS AND YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE THE THE. THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN ADDRESS IT IT CHINA JUST DECIDED TO DO IT YOU KNOW ALL OF A SUDDEN AND SO THERE WAS NO PLANNING AND SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL. GIVE. GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON HOW WE CAN PLAN AND HOW WE CAN FUND SO THAT SOME OF THESE ON PROJECTS AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS. YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T EXPECTING IT AND AND SO NOBODY WAS NECESSARILY PLANNING OR INVESTING IN THESE MARKETS SO I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THEM ARM INTO COMMUNITY ON HELPING US IDENTIFY HOW. WE CAN FUNDING IS. I TO TO TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO SAY YOU NEED TO FIND THIS AND THEN ANOTHER THING IS WHO'S GOING TO FUNDED. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION.

AND WITH THAT THE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE. I DON'T THIRTY FIVE A. B. THIRTY ONE SEVENTY EIGHT BY MEMBER RUBIO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED IN REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS WERE OUT SEARCHING Y. MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA. CHAU CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. LIMON. MCCARTY. MELENDEZ REYES. REYES AYE STONE. STONE I FIVE ZERO. FIVE ZERO BILLS ON CALL THANK YOU VERY LINK YOU. OUR NEXT WE HAVE MISTER HOLDEN ITEM NUMBER THIRTY FOUR AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO. PRESENT AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX TODAY. MUCH LIKE ACTIVE PRODUCTION SITES. IDLE ABANDONED AND HAZARDOUS INACTIVE OIL AND GAS WELLS CAN LEAD POLLUTION INTO THE AIR WATER AND GROUND. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN ADDRESSING POLLUTION FROM THESE WELLS THROUGH RECENT LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS. THIS BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER THE PUBLIC'S KNOWLEDGE. AND FORM ONGOING OIL AND GAS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH ACCUMULATING EMISSIONS DATA. THE STATE AND PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE PLUGIN IDLE AN ABANDONED WELLS BUT ARE NOT TESTING AND UP AND REPORTING WHAT IF ANY CHEMICALS ARE BEING EMITTED. FROM THESE WELLS. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX PROPOSES EMISSIONS TESTING TO BE DONE ON. PROXIMITY WELLS THOSE THAT ARE WITH ONE QUARTER MILE OF A HUMAN OCCUPIED BUILDING. THAT ARE BEING PLUGGED IN ABANDONED BY OIL AND GAS OPERATORS PURSUANT TO AN IDOL WELL MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND HAZARDOUS ABANDONED WELLS BEING PLUGGED AND ABANDONED BY DR. ENHANCE FLOW RATE TESTING MUST BE PERFORMED ON WELLS WARRANTED IT INDICATION OF AN ACTIVE EMISSIONS SOURCE IS PRESENT. AND THE DATA COLLECTED FROM SUCH TESTING SO BE MADE AVAILABLE ON THE DOCTOR WEBSITE. I HAVE WITH ME TIM O'CONNOR DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OIL AND GAS PROGRAM IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIR WEAVERVILLE DEFENSE FUND IS A SPONSOR OF AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX AND OVER THE PAST OF FOR YEARS EDF HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT. OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO CHARACTERIZE THE AIR WATER AND CLIMATE. AND PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS FROM THE OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS BILL THROUGH ITS NARROW FOCUS ON I DON'T ABANDONED WELLS WILL HELP SOLVE THE CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP ASSOCIATED WITH AGING OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IDLE AND ABANDONED OIL AND GAS WELLS CAN AND DO LEAGUE COMPOUNDS INTO THE AIR ONE SUCH COMPOUND METHANE. IS A POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS EIGHTY FOUR TIMES THAT MORE POWERFUL THE CARBON DIOXIDE. I COULD YOU TO CLIMATE CHANGE OVER THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS IT'S RELEASED. O. OTHER COMPOUNDS INCLUDE BENZENE AND TOLLEY WE WHICH ARE BOTH KNOWN HUMAN CARCINOGENS UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH RESEARCH ON IDLE AND ABANDON WELL LEAKAGE HAVE NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHICH CALIFORNIA WELLS ARE LEAKING. LEAVING REGULATORS AND FENCE LINE COMMUNITIES WITH LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE AT CONTROLLING POLLUTION FROM THESE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB 27-29 TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF IDLE AND ABANDONED WELLS IN THE STATE. AS A RESULT OF THIS LAW OPERATORS WILL SOON BE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WELLS HE'LL BE PLUGGING ON A YEARLY BASIS AND DAUGHTER WILL BE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WELLS THAT IT RESPONSE TO. THAT ARE ON AN ABANDONED WELL LIST AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX ADVANCES THESE EFFORTS BY DEVELOPING DATA ON A MISSIONS BEFORE AND AFTER WELL PLUGGING WILL HELP PROVIDE A SCIENCE BASED DETERMINATION. OF WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S DOING ENOUGH TO LIMIT THE EMISSIONS FROM THE SOURCES BY TARGETING WELLS THAT ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE REMEDIATED A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX. CAPITALIZES ON LABOR THE WILL ALREADY BE DEPLOYED AT THE SITES THEREBY REDUCING COSTS AND TARGETING WELLS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EMITTING POLLUTION. THE OPPOSITION THIS BILL WILL LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX IS DUPLICATIVE OR OTHERWISE UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER RULES AND OTHER REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA OR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WELL THERE ARE STANDARDS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THEY DO NOTHING TO UNDERMINE THE NEED AND THE VALUE OF THIS BILL. NONE OF THE EXISTING RULES OR STANDARDS DEVELOP THE EMISSIONS DATA ON THESE WELLS THAT THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX WILL CULTIVATE. AND WILL MAKE IT AND WILL MAKE IT A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE MANNER. WITH REGARD TO THE DISTANCE ESTABLISHED IN THE BILL. HERE AB ONE THIRTY EARTH THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX SIXTY SCIENCE BASED YET CONSERVATIVE APPROACH ACCORDING TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN STUDY BY STAND ELWAY. A A OF LOOKING LOOKING APPEAR REVIEWED RESEARCH IN EIGHT SEPARATE STUDIES EVALUATED THEIR DOCUMENT EXPOSURES OF POTENTIAL DELETERIOUS IMPACTS ON NEARBY COMMUNITIES FROM OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AT A DISTANCE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET. AB ONE THIRTY FIVE ONE FORTY SIX ESTABLISHES A CONSERVATIVE A DISTANT AT APPROXIMATELY THIS LINE PLUS ABOUT A TEN PERCENT MARGIN OF ERROR. IT ITS COULD WRAP UP. IT GO THIRTY FOUR IT THROUGH FORTY SIX INDUSTRY VEHICLE FOR THE STATE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF UNPLUGGED I DON'T BEEN WELLS WE'VE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU DRIVE UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS PETER BETTER AND I HAVE BEEN AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT THE ENERGY INDUSTRY FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. THE PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SECTOR. I'VE DONE WORK IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR AS WELL. FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON IMPROVING FIELD OPERATIONS. AND ADVISING. ON MY CLIENTS ONE. THE ACQUISITION AND EVALUATION OF. STRIPPER OIL WELLS. OF. DO MY WORK BECOME IT WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE REALITIES OF OPERATING LOW PRODUCING WELLS AND MANY OF THESE PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH LOW MARGIN OPERATIONS. FOR SUCH OPERATORS AIBILEEN WELL AS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PREFERABLE TO ENCOURAGE THE HIGH COST OF PROPERLY PLUGGING IN THE BAND IN A WELL. CAME INTEREST IN STATE THE PROBLEM OF THE BAND THAT NIGHT WELLES AFTER READING THE ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES. WITH REFERENCE TO NASA JPL CALTECH STUDY OF METHANE IN THE LA BASIN. THEY'D FOUND METHANE LEVELS UP TO SIXTY ONE PERCENT GREATER THAN HAD PREVIOUSLY PROTECT BEEN PREDICTED BY THE EPA. BEEN A RESIDENT OF THE LA AREA IT'S CAUSED ME GREAT CONCERN AND CREEK MY INTEREST. AS I'VE LOOKED DEEPER INTO THE SUBJECT STUDY AFTER STUDY I'VE REVIEWED CITED FINDINGS THAT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE ACCIDENT EPA'S ESTIMATES OF METHANE LEAKAGE FROM OIL GAS OPERATION. HAS BEEN SUSPECT. APPEARS THAT MANY CASES EPA GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATED FREAKY TREE. ONE OF MORE RELEVANT STUDIES ON AN OIL AND GAS WELL WHICH WAS PERFORMED ON WE GET FROM ONE GAS WELLS WAS PERFORMED BY PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. IN A STUDY THROUGH A SMALL SAMPLE OF WELLS IN PENNSYLVANIA WAS FOUND THAT ALMOST ALL THE WELLS OBSERVED. WERE LEAKING TO SOME EXTENT SOME QUITE HIGH. OTHER PEER REVIEW PUBLICATIONS SUPPORTED THE FINDING THAT I'D ONLY BEEN THE WELLS. HAVE A LEAKAGE PROBLEM AND THE INDUSTRY ITSELF HAS REPORTED THAT WELL CASE FAILURE RATES MAYBE OVER TWENTY PERCENT. INCREASING AS THE WELLS AGE. IN THE LA BASIN LIKE CENTRAL VALLEY ITEM BIGELOW WELL WAS ARE COMMON PLACE MANY OF THESE WELLS WERE BANNED LONG BEFORE THE FORMATION OF DOGRA NINETEEN FIFTEEN. AND BEFORE THEIR ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF PLUCKING AND ABANDONED MEANT STANDARDS. PRIOR TO NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THERE WERE NO AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS AS TO HOW TO PLUG AND ABANDONED OIL WELL. OF THE OVER TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IDLE IN BAND OF WELLESLEY CALIFORNIA. THOUSANDS THESE WELLS HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS IN SEVERAL HUNDRED LISTED HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR FORTY YEARS OR MORE. SIR AND ASK YOU TO TRY TO WRAP UP THOUGH RIGHT. YEAH I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE. PEOPLE FROM. THE. STANFORD SCHOOL OF EARTH ENERGY ENVIRONMENT SCIENCE AND THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO MEASURE METHANE LEAKAGE FROM BEEN DENIED WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. BASED ON THEIR PRELIMINARY RESEARCH AND IT IS ADMITTEDLY SMALL SAMPLE. IT APPEARS THAT AMONG THE IDA WELLS SURVEYED THE MAJORITY OF THEM. HAVE BEEN LEAKING. THE. IF WE COULD RATES HOLD ON ADDITIONAL WELLS THAT GET TESTED. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY THAT. LEAKS FROM ABANDONED IDA WELLS. CONTRIBUTORS ARE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE. METHANE POLLUTION THE STATE. I BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE INVESTIGATE LEAKAGE FROM THESE THOUSANDS OF IDLE IN BAND AND WELLS IN EFFORT TO QUANTIFY THE PROBLEM BY BUILDING AN ACCURATE DATABASE OF LEAKAGE LEVELS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SHARON MEMBERS DON'T WE GO COURSE PROCLAIM THEIR SUPPORT. WILL VARY WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MARK FENCE MAKERS ASK BY THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA ASTHMA COLLABORATIVE TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. CAO JUSTICE URKEL CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT. IT'D JUST MULLIN FROM NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. RIGHT ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SAYING NINE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND. YOU CAN STAY HERE. ACTUALLY WHAT. COME OUT OF IT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS REALLY SUCH AS WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. REGRETTABLY ARE OPPOSED TO A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ALTERNATE STAFF. HAVING AN OPEN DOOR POLICY AND HAVING A ROBUST CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE. BUT YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE AN EXTENSIVE ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS RELATIVE TO I DON'T WELL SUBJECT TO THE STRINGENT MONITORING REQUIREMENTS UNDER FEDERAL STATE. AND SOME LOCAL PROGRAMS OUT TO BEGIN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE US EPA GREENHOUSE GAS REPORTING PROGRAM COVERS EMISSION FROM MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF THEOIL AND GAS INDUSTRY UNDER THIS PROGRAM OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF WILES. AND RELATED EQUIPMENT MUST REPORT THE COMBINED EMISSIONS FOR ALL WELLS THAT THEY OWN AND OPERATE. WITHIN EACH PRODUCTION BASE AND. THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE ANNUAL REPORTING A OF THEIR CO TWO AND METHANE EMISSIONS. BASED ON MEASUREMENTS OF FUELING PRODUCE GAS THIS INFORMATION IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE I DON'T WANT TO GET ON THE NEW ONCE IT'S ON THE CALIFORNIA SIGN MY COUNTERPART IT'S A BILL WILL COVER THOSE. BUT THERE IS. IDA WELLS ARE SUBJECT TO SECTION NINE FIVE SIX SIX EIGHT OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS SPECIFIC TO LEAK DETECTION AND REPAIR. WHICH SUCH EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES THEY INCLUDE AUDIO VISUAL INSPECTION. THAT IS REQUIRED ON A DAILY OR WEEKLY BASIS FOR ALL EQUIPMENT. ON ON THE LOCAL AIR PROGRAMS. THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION DISTRICT WHERE OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION OCCURS IN THE STATE. REQUIRES QUARTERLY INSPECTIONS MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR REQUIREMENTS THAT LIGHT OIL PRODUCTION. FACILITIES AND AT THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. THEY REQUIRE FACILITIES OPERATE UNDER THE DISTRICT. PERMIT TO ANNUAL REPORT EMISSIONS FROM ALL THEIR EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION ANY DISTRICT WITH. LOCATION SELECTED BY THE ARB WILL DEPLOY A COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM AND MAY REQUIRE STATIONARY SOURCE TO DEPLOY FENCE LINE MONITORING SYSTEM OR OTHER APPROPRIATE REAL TIME. ONSITE MONITORING IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EXISTING PROJECTS PLANNED TO TRACK COMMISSION THINK COMMUNITIES. THE ARB IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING PROJECTS TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE AIR QUALITY COMMUNITIES NEAR OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS LIKE THAT SNAPS PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDE WILL PROVIDE A BETTER ARE A BIT MORE CLEAR PICK. EXCUSE ME PICTURE ARE ON ON THE ISSUES. TO FOCUSING ON JUST OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION SITES ESPECIALLY ON IDLE WELLS. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX DOES ACKNOWLEDGE OTHER COMMENT SOURCES OF POLLUTION THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PROXIMITY OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. SO THIS IS ESSENTIALLY NOT ADDRESSING A BIG PICTURE ON THE COMMITTEES EXPOSURE TO COME IT CUMULATIVE POLLUTION SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE THANK YOU. IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS P. ANTHONY THOMAS TRIPS THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. AND THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS I'VE. I'VE READ THE BILL. A FEW TIMES AND I'VE READ THE ANALYSIS IS A COUPLE TIMES AND I'M. STILL NOT EXACTLY SURE. WHAT PROBLEM THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE NOW THE PROPONENTS DID A VERY? NICE JOB IN IN SAYING ABOUT POLLUTION AND AN. IDOL WELLS AND. AND AND THE BALANCE OF THE WELL THAT THAT WE HAPPEN I'M STILL NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO. ANY POLICY ENVIRONMENT MEMBERS THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE HISTORY THAT THIS BILL IS IN REACTION TO IF YOU CAN'T SOLVE WERE ANSWER THOSE TWO QUESTIONS. THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL. NOW ARMY TWENTY SEVENTEEN CARP OWN COMPLETED A NEW REGULATIONS FOR MONITORING AND A REDUCTION OF METHANE EMISSIONS. BOB APPALLING AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION FACILITIES WHICH INCLUDES BOTH ACTIVE. AS WELL AS IDLE WELLS. THE BILL WOULD MANDATE ADDITIONAL TESTING. AS THE PROPONENTS ATTEMPTED TO SAY THAT WE WOULD ALSO COMMENDED AND INDICATE. BUT THE OPERATORS AT THE DIRECTION OF DR FOR I'D WELL DONE A PRESIDENT IS SCHEDULED TO BE PLUGGED. AND A BAND SEX INTO A STATES PERFORM APPROPRIATE TESTING AS DETERMINED BY THE SUPERVISOR OF ANY WEALTH AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT. BEING PLUGGED IN ABANDONED TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF ATMOSPHERIC EMISSIONS HYDROCARBON POLLUTANTS BEFORE THE INITIATION OF AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF PHYSICAL WORK. IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE. IT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE. NOW. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE TO BUILD IT STEP AHEAD A CHANCE TO WORK ON STATUE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DID CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATORS MANAGE THEIR IDYLLWILD INVENTORIES. OPERATORS NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO ENTER INTO A TITLE WELL MANAGEMENT PLAN AND IT DOES REQUIRE MEMBERS. PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF A PERCENT OF IDYLLWILD ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS. PARTICULATE XIN. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE AND THEN AB SIX S. ONE SIX ONE SEVEN BOTH AREN'T SUFFICIENT ENOUGH THE LET'S REPEAL THOSE DECISIONS AND PUT EVERYTHING THAT. THAT WAS IN THOSE PROVISIONS. AND WHAT THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX HAS THE TEMPERAMENT DO AND IT'S MAKING A BILL. LET'S NOT REPEAT WHAT HAS ALREADY GONE ON. LET'S NOT BE REPETITIVE MEMBERS NOT BE REDUNDANT. JUST BECAUSE. THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. AND AS I CLOSE I'M ONLY REFERENCE OVER REGULATION THIS IS THE PRIME EXAMPLE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE WHAT PERCENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAY NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. ONE IT'S. WELL IS THAT ARE TO BE PLUGGED. ARE TESTED PRIOR TO THAT TAKING PLACE SO. DOES THIS THIS SEEMS LIKE IT PROLONGS. THAT ACTION THAT NOW YOU HAVE TO STOP RATHER THAN GOING HAD IMPLIED THAT YOU HAVE TO WAIT AND GO THROUGH THE STEPS OF DOING THE TESTING RATHER THAN JUST. DOING WHAT YOU SET OUT TO DO. CAN YOU JUST. COMMENT ON THAT SURE A. WHAT THE BILL DOES? ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN AND AROUND WITHIN A QUARTER MILE. SO IT'S BEEN VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THE DISTANCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A ABANDONED WELLS IDA WELLS THAT ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE A REVIEW OF THESE WELLS TESTING. TO BE VERY CLEAR OF WHAT KIND OF. HYDROCARBONS EMISSIONS THAT ARE COMING FROM THE POLLUTANTS THAT ARE COMING FROM THESE PARTICULAR WELLS THAT ARE CLOSE AS I SAY TO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD SENATE'S. WITH THAT GOAL IN MIND AND THERE ARE SOME TESTING THAT'S BEEN DONE THAT'S TO BE SURE THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF BILLS IN RECENT TIMES TO ADDRESS THAT. HA BUT THIS BILL IS LOOKING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE LASER TO IN ITS ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS. ABANDONED WELLS NOT A WELL CENTER CLOSE TO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT IS COMING OUT OF THOSE WELLS INDICATES. ACTUALLY LEAKING INTO THE GROUND AND INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. AND TO PROVIDE MORE DATA THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO. OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND NOW TURN TO THE SPONSORS TO. ADD ON TO THAT IF THAT'S AN AND I ASK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE IS ALREADY TESTING THAT IS REQUIRED. OF NEARLY ALL OF THESE WELLS SO I'M JUST. I'M NOT SEEING HOW THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT. WOULD CHANGE WHAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE. FIGURES OWNER TIM O'CONNOR FOR THE VIRAL DEFENSE FUND SO YOUR CRACK THERE ARE TESTS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF WELLS. THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OF BEING ABANDONED HER THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS FOR AIR EMISSIONS TESTING IN PARTICULAR WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROCESS OF AN AMENDMENT YOU CAN TAKE WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS TO BE. PERFORMED. ONE OF THESE AIR TESTS CAN TAKE. BETWEEN FIFTEEN MINUTES IN ONE HOUR A TO BE CONDUCTED. SO IT IS MEANT TO CAPITALIZE ON ALL THAT WORK IN MANPOWER THAT IS ALREADY GOING TO BE THE SITES TO CONDUCT A TEST. WHERE IT WILL NOT IMPACT THE? THE LONGEVITY OF THE OF THE PLUCKING PROCESS SPECIFICALLY THE BILL HAS A PROVISION THAT SAYS NOTHING. SHALL IMPEDE O. OR PREVENT. OPERATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO. MAINTAIN A SAFE OPERATION OR TWO. THEY WILL IMPEDE THE SAFETY OF OF WELL SO VARIES SPECIFICALLY. THERE'S A CARD IN THE BILL FOR THAT. AND WE DO NOT EXPECT IT WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE ANY OF THE TIME. FOR THE POINT OF. INITIATION TO COMPLETION FROM ANY WEB LOGGING OPERATION. WHO? I WANTED TO TURN INTO A DIALOGUE CHO INTEREST BE RESPECTFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A VERY BIG AGENDA I'M JUST. SO I HAVE. RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COULD OWN QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEE NONE. HIT IDEA ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MO MOVEMENT SECONDED. THIS HOLDEN WHICH LIKE CLOSE. I THINK IT WAS SECURING COMMITTEE. THIS'S FOR AN AREA THAT WE BELIEVE AGAIN NEEDS. SPECIFIC FOCUS I THINK GOOD BILL IS VERY TARGETED IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER HOLDEN AYE UP AS A FELLOW MEMBER REPRESENTING LOS ANGELES. KEY ISSUES OF VITAL AND ABANDONED WELLS ARE. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WE ALL KNOW. NOT JUST IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA BUT THE BUT STATE AND SO. GOOD BILL AND I. RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE. ITEM THIRTY FOUR A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SIX BY MEMBER HOLD ON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND PRO AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS WERE UP TO JULY MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA CHILD. CHAU AYE EGGMAN FLORA LOAN FROM. MCCARTY. MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NOTORIOUS. VARIOUS AYE STONE. THREE ONE THREE ONE GOES ON CALL THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE MISTER SALAS. ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THE PRESENT BEFORE YOU ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT BUT BEFORE I BEGIN LET ME FIRST. STATE THAT'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. I APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF'S WORK ON THAT THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. AND. WITH THAT AYE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE AIR B. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY.

ALL OF US ARE AWARE OF THE DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES OF THE TO HAVE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES BUT THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD. OR DYING TREES IN OUR FOREST AND WE KNOW THAT OUR FORESTS ARE OVERLY DANCE HISTORICALLY THERE WERE FOUR HUNDRED. FORTY TREES TO AN ACRE NOW THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED TREES TO PER ACRE. IN ORDER TO RESTORE OUR FOREST'S TO A HEALTHIER MORE RESILIENT STATE WE NEED TO REMOVE THE EXCESS FUEL. THEN OUR FOREST SO THAT THE REMAINING TREES CAN GROW BIGGER. TALLER AND STRONGER AND INCREASE BOTH THE PACE AND SCALE OF THE WORK WE ARE DOING TO ADDRESS THE DENSITY PROBLEM. AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE IS BASED UPON A BILL OF RIGHTS ESTABLISHED BY CAL EPA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT SUBMITTERS. MY BILL DOES NOT BYPASS ANY SICK STEPS IN THE TIMBER HARVESTING PLAN REVIEW PROCESS FOR ELIMINATE ANY SAFEGUARDS HE MAKES THE REVIEW. MORE EFFICIENT BY REDUCING SUBMISSION ERRORS THROUGH USE OF A CHECKLIST THAT INCLUDES WHAT. CONSTITUTES AN ACCEPTED TEACH P.. A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN AND BY CREATING EFFICIENCIES IN REVIEW% TIME BY ENCOURAGING AGENCIES TO INCLUDE MITIGATION MEASURES FOR ADDITIONAL PERMITS. THE SPONSORS AND STAFF MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE COMMITTEES CONSULTANTS AND CAL FIRE AS WELL AS THE SIERRA CLUB IN ORDER TO ADDRESS. CONCERNS RAISED. THOSE AMENDMENTS RESULTED IN A REWRITE OF THE BILL CONTAINED IN THE APRIL SIXTEENTH VIRGIN VERSION. I HAVE ALSO AGREED TO AN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS A FINAL CONCERN RAISED BY COMMITTEE STAFF AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO RESOLVE THEIR CONCERNS AND TODAY I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME I HAVE SEVERAL WITNESSES TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. RICH GORDON PRESIDENT AND CEO OF CALIFORNIA'S ANDREA HOWELL SIERRA PACIFIC INDUSTRIES AND CHRIS MERTON'S SIERRA BUSINESS COUNCIL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SAID DE I'M HERE IS PRESIDENCY ó CALIFORNIA SUN THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE. IN TWENTY TWELVE THE TIMBER INDUSTRY SUPPORTED AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS CREATED A ONE PERCENT ASSESSMENT ON LUMBER PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. THE DEDICATED FUNDING FROM THIS SOURCE IS USED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES AND COSTS. OF THE DEPARTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVIEW OF PROJECTS ARE ERMITS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT TIMBER HARVEST OPERATIONS. AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE WOULD ALIGN PERFECTLY WITH THE INTENT OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. THE FORCE PRACTICES ASK ACT PROVIDES FOR REVIEW OF TIMBER HARVEST PLAN IN AS LITTLE AS SEVENTY ONE DAYS. HOWEVER THE REPORT UNTIL REGULATION AND FORCED RESTORATION. NOTED IN THAT REVIEW THAT THE REVIEW TIME IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AVERAGE A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN DAYS. SEVENTY ONE PREDICTED HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN DAYS ACTUAL IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND THAT WAS AN INCREASE. HAVE FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN ONE OF TOOK A HUNDRED SEVEN DAYS. THIS INCREASE IN THE TIME OF PROCESSING A IS IN SPITE OF THE FOLLOWING. ONE. THE NUMBER OF TEACH PEACE SUBMITTED FOR CONSIDERATION DECREASED IN THOSE YEARS. BY SIX. TO. THE NUMBER OF ACRES TO BE TREATED WAS REDUCED IN THOSE YEARS BY TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES. AND THREE. THE NUMBER OF STAFF IN THE DEPARTMENT'S INCREASED BY TWENTY FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS. EVEN AFTER TV APPROVAL. TEACH FEW SUBMITTERS MUSLIM SEEK ADDITIONAL PERMITS TO DELAY CAN STREAM THAT ALTERATION AGREEMENTS AND PERMITS ASSOCIATED WITH NONPOINT SOLUTION DISCHARGES. THIS OFTEN EXTENDS THE REVIEW TIME WELL BEYOND A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN DAYS. WHY IS TIME IMPORTANT? THE PUBLIC POLICY IS TO CALIFORNIA THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF ALL DESCRIBE OUR FORESTS AS BEING IN CRISIS YOU'D EXCESS FUEL. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE IN ORDER TO RESTORE FOREIGN TRIP FORCED RESILIENCY. PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES FROM CATASTROPHIC FIRE. AND MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. YEAH AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY NINE WOULD PROVIDE ASSURANCE FOR TIMELINESS IN PLAN REVIEW. WITHOUT REDUCING A SINGLE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. WHEN REPEAT THAT.

NOBODY'S. OKAY. SIX. HERE OKAY SIX ZERO THE BILL WAS OUT. THE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER THIRTY AB THIRTY FIFTEEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON THE INTENT LANGUAGE FIVE THAT WAS SAM. LATE BLOOMING. AYE AB THIRTY FIFTEEN WILL ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO PLAN FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION OF OUR FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. AND SUPPLY CHAINS FROM OUR CURRENT DIESEL BASED TECHNOLOGY SWORDS AT ZERO AND NEAR ZERO ADMISSION EMISSIONS FUTURE. THIS WILL BE A COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS AND NOT WITHOUT SOME CONTROVERSY BUT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION INCLUDING A WHOLE. THINK YOU THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT TRANSLATE TRANSITION NEEDS TO OCCUR. IT WILL BE A COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT IT BE PLANNED AND IMPLEMENTED WITH OUR INDUSTRY AND LABOR PARTNERS AT THE TABLE. AND THAT WHEN WE INVEST STATE DOLLARS INTO NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN NEW EQUIPMENT THAT WE DO IT WITH A WELL THOUGHT OUT IN STRATEGIC PLAN. OTHERWISE WE RUN THE RISK OF SETTLING THOSE WHO ULTIMATELY PAY FOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTS. THE OWNERS OF EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OF CARGO THAT GETS SHIPPED WITH SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND JEOPARDIZE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF OUR PORTS. AS YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ARE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. AS A REPRESENTATIVE WITH HEAVY INTEREST IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND INVESTMENT IN OUR PORT GATEWAYS CAN SUPPORT AND GROW JOBS ACROSS ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW TOO WELL THAT INCREASED TRADE BARRIERS CAN CAUSE REAL HARM. INCREASES IN THE COST OF TRADE CAN ALSO OCCUR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AB THIRTY FIFTY FIFTEEN WILL HELP TO AVOID THIS. WE CAN ALL ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL HAVE MORE COSTLY PART INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT COSTS BUT WITH GOOD PLANNING AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT ARE ZERO. THEIR TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSIONS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON JOBS AND LIGHTS IN BOTH RURAL CALIFORNIA IN INCOME COMMUNITIES. NEIGHBORING OUR PORTS WE HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED COMMUNICATIONS OF CONCERN FROM LABOR AND WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IF THE BILL PROP. PROCEEDS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY AND WITH ME TODAY IS MY TAKE UP. MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIGHT TAKE WITH PMS I.

EQUIPMENT IN EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THE NEXT STEP IS MOVING TOWARDS ZERO NEAR ZERO MISSION SOLUTIONS TO FURTHER. REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS SOME OF THOSE. A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND WE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED. THAT'S OVER TERMINALS BUT MOST OF NOT. THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ROAMING MAKING BY THEIR RESOURCES BOARD BUT AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CAMARO. WILD OUT VERY CLEARLY. THE SUCCESS AGAIN BE RELYING ON FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL. THAT IS BE A PLAN FOR IN HIS BE PAID FOR. AND THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD IN EARNEST WE HAVE TO PLANNING PRINCIPLES.

AGAIN I MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM THIRTY AB THIRTY FIFTEEN BY CABALLERO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS WERE OUT FIFTEEN AYE MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA AYE ACOSTA AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. LIMON. LET ALONE I MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE MELINDA'S BELINDA'S IRENAEUS. VARIOUS AYE STONE. STONE AYE. EIGHT ZERO EIGHT ZERO THE BILLS OUT. NEXT WE HAVE. ITEM NUMBER THIRTY THREE A. B. THIRTY THIRTY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT. AB THIRTY THIRTY WHICH ATTACKS POVERTY IN EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA BY CREATING MARKET MARKET CONDITIONS FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAPITAL TO REACH COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY CHRONIC POVERTY THESE REALLY. THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES ARE THE POOREST OF THE POOR IN OUR COMMUNITY. RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THE CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN POVERTY WITH OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR RESIDENTS IMPACTED WE NEED THE NATION FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY TOO. MANY RESIDENTS IN OPPORTUNITIES OWNS. ARE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE WHILE URBAN COASTAL AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE BEEN A FATE BENEFITTED FROM AN ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION SINCE OUR GREAT RECESSION. AB THIRTY THIRTY MAKES CALIFORNIA'S POOREST AREAS AN ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUND INVESTMENT AS CALIFORNIA COMPETES FOR FUNDS NATIONALLY WITH EVERY OTHER PROJECT SEEKING OPPORTUNITY FUND INVESTMENTS. THE LACK ABOUT ACCESS TO INVESTMENT CAPITAL PRECLUDES POOR COMMUNITIES FROM ADDRESSING ISSUES LIKE BUSINESS STARTS HOUSING AVAILABILITY BLIGHT AND OUT ULTIMATELY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO INVESTMENT CAPITAL KEEPS POOR PEOPLE POOR. OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS TAPPED INTO A SIX TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET OF UNREALIZED CAPITAL GAINS HELD BY CORPORATIONS AND IN INDIVIDUALS. CONTRIBUTIONS TO OPERATE OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS WILL CLOSE IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THERE'S A VERY SHORT WINDOW FOR COMMUNITIES TO WORK WITH THESE FUNDS AND BRING IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT. EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WILL SEEK OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS AND ALREADY EIGHTEEN STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HAVE TRACKS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY. CALIFORNIA'S EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DESIGNATED TRACKS ARE COMMUNITIES DEFINED BY THE GOVERNOR AS MOST IN NEED OF INFUSION OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. BECAUSE THEIR CENSUS TRACTS THAT SUBURB SUPPER FROM ABJECT POVERTY. BUT HAVE FIT CONDITIONS SUCH AS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE RAPID REDEVELOPMENT A BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOOD. SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS EVERY MEMBER HERE ON THIS COMPACT AT COMMITTEE IT COMMITTEE. WELL BENEFIT IF ABLE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT CAPITAL FROM OPPORTUNITIES OWN FUNDS. AND EIGHTY SIXTY SIX ZONE TRACKS ARE LOCATED NEAR WEST CARSON IN EIGHTY SIXTY SEVEN IT'S THE AREA SURROUNDING PARRIS VALLEY IN WINCHESTER. FORTY NINE ITS DESIGNATED SMALL PORTIONS OF EAST EL MONTE. THIRTY SEVEN FILMORE AND SANTA PAULA. TWENTY NINE TWIN LAKES SANTA CRUZ MARINA AND SEASIDE. FORTY SEVEN. UP OF FONTANA RIALTO BLOOMINGTON SAN BERNADINO COLTON AND LOW MY VEST LOMA LINDA. THIRTEEN STOCKTON AND FRENCH CAP. CAMP BUT TWELVE. EAST STOCKTON INTERLOCK MODESTO AND KEYS. AND OH SEVEN THE OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY ZONE EXTENDS FROM DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO DARDEN IN FLORIN AREAS ALMOST FORTY PERCENT OF THE DIST AT THE DISTRICT THE ENTIRE DISTRICT. DIEM IN PIC IMPACT OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL REACHING NEIGHBORHOOD SEPARATE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC POVERTY CANNOT BE UNDER UNDER ESTIMATED. THE LOCAL INITIATIVES SUPPORT CORPORATION OR LISK IS A NATIONAL SOCIAL ENTERPRISE THAT INVESTS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO POOR COMMUNITIES. AND ITS C. E. O. MORRIS MAURICE JONES IS AN ADVOCATE ADVOCATE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN FIRSTHAND. THE IMPACT OF LISTS. INVESTMENT IN POOR COMMUNITIES. WHEN THEY'D HEAVILY INVESTED IN REHABBING IN NEW CONSTRUCTION A PROPERTIES AND POOR COMMUNITIES THOSE AREAS PERFORMED BETTER ON EMPLOYMENT GROWTH. WITH MORE PRE PEOPLE WORKING AT HIGHER WAGES PREEMIE BRINGING CAPITAL BACK INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS. RATHER THAN INTO OTHER ACT COMMUNITIES AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME ROSE WHEN THERE WAS A HEAVY INVESTMENT. OF LESS. INVESTMENTS. WITH A DEMONSTRATED CONNECTION BETWEEN FILE LEVELS OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IN NEIGHBORHOOD THAT SUFFER CHRONIC POVERTY IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT LIST IS EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES OWN PROGRAM IT'S A FEDERAL DESIGNATION. AND AS I SAID CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY ON BOARD WITH THE DESIGNATE THAT DOES DESIGNATING ALL OF OUR TO OUR DISTRICTS. AB THIRTY THIRTY WAS RECENTLY AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES AN OPPORTUNITY ZONES WILL NOT EXPERIENCE AN INTENTIONAL DISPLACEMENT AND GENTRIFICATION. AND IMPORTANTLY LISK DID NOT OBSERVE ANY GENTRIFICATION IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE IT MADE ITS INVESTMENT. BUT IS SEEING A DIVERSITY AMONG ITS INCOME EARNERS. GOVERNOR BROWN IS ALREADY JOIN THE FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA BY VOLUNTARILY SUBMITTING THESE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE TRACKS NOW IT'S TIME TO GIVE THOSE COMMUNITIES A WIDE BERTH AND ROBUST PLATFORM TO GO INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND COMPETE WITH EVERY OTHER STATE. PROPER TO ENTITIES OWNED FUNDS THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN KEITH DONE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY ONE FOR BRING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FORWARD TO COMBAT. POVERTY IN OUR STATE AND ALSO PROVIDE HOUSING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PURPOSE CHAU MIGHT ASK YOUR SUPPORT. YEAH GATHERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ALSO IN SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED THINKING. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HAPPY AT THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT. ANY FURTHER. REX FBI WITH CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT THE BILL. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN KYLE JOHNSON CIRCLE CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS A OPPOSED THIS BILL. WHAT THE BILL DOES IS CREATE A CONVOLUTED EXEMPTION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE PUBLICLY DISCLOSED ANALYZE AND MITIGATE THEIR IMPACTS? AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTED OUT THAT THERE THERE. THAT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH UTILITY IN THIS EXEMPTION SINCE IT'S PRETTY MUCH GOING TO THE SEQUEL PROCESS AS. IT ALREADY EXISTS. AND AND I WOULD NOTE THAT. SHOULD ANYBODY FAILED TO ANALYZE OR DISCLOSE OR MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS THEN THEY COULD BE LITIGATED FOR USING THE EXEMPTION AND IT IT'S BASICALLY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE UNDER EXISTING LAW. OF THE ANALYSIS ALSO POINTS OUT THAT HOUSING PROJECTS ALREADY RECEIVED NUMEROUS EXEMPTIONS ARE UNDER THE LAW THROUGH AT A STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS BUT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THERE'S HOT PROCESSES IN WHICH TO TEAR UP PROJECTS OFF OF. GENERAL PLAN YEAH OURS TO MAKE THE PROCESS GO QUICKER. THERE'S ALSO THE COMMUNITY PLAN EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY PLAN OR CLASS THIRTY TWO EXEMPTIONS FOR INFILL PROJECTS SO GIVEN THE THE WORLD OF OF EXISTING. DEVICES OUT THERE THAT THAT FOLKS COULD USE FOR AYE HOUSING THAT HAS NO IMPACT. WE WE THINK THAT THAT THIS THAT THIS ISN'T. AS WRITTEN THE BILL WOULDN'T REALLY BE UTILIZED AYE AND SO WE URGE A NO VOTE TODAY. THIS SHOWS THAT IF YOU KINGS AS A AT THE TABLE BECAUSE I KNOW I FOR ONE HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. CNN OKAY. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS EGGMAN. TO THIS IT IT SUNSET BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY SIX BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THE THE FUND RUNS OUT IS THAT CORRECT CREEK SO THERE IS SOME EMERGENCY AT. YEAH I AM. I THINK THE THE THE THE CRITERIA THAT YOU DRAFTED WHILE SIMILAR TO SEQUEL I THINK. I'M BETTING PROVIDE SOME PRETTY CLEAR OUTWEIGHS ITS STEPS AWAY FROM THAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING ABLE TO GET INVESTMENT IN THOSE PLEASE COMMUNITIES BETWEEN TWENTY SIX. PLEASURE NOTED MOST OF MY BUT MUCH OF MY DISTRICT IS ALREADY IN THE ZONES. AND WE ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO I HAVE A QUESTION MISTER JONES IF. THE BILL. IT'S PRETTY MUCH COVERED IN YOUR OPINION BY EXISTING EXEMPTIONS THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. THE BILL. I I JUST THINK THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND MOVING FORWARD WITH. PROPOSALS AGES I THINK IT COMPLICATES THE CODE IT IT ADDS MORE LAYERS IN THERE THAT. I DON'T THINK WE NEED. YOU KNOW IT DOES SUNSET BUT IT JUST IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT TO GO FORWARD WITH AND. YEAH I AGREE THAT INVESTMENT IN THESE COMMUNITIES IS GOOD BUT I DISAGREE. AND I STE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I I DISAGREE WITH THAT THERE AGAINST THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE BILL AS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THAT SEEK WHY IS IS WHAT'S HOLDING UP THESE INVESTMENTS I AM I THINK. IT'S WHEN YOU KNOW UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY SIX THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME AND WHEN ORDER TO GO THROUGH PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS GET COMMUNITY BY AND FOR PROJECTS. AT AND GET THOSE INVESTMENTS TO OCCUR. ALRIGHT. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SINGH NANDA MS COVERED IT WAS LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY WANT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE EXPENDITURE OF ANY STATE FUNDS. DOESN'T REQUIRE THE EXPENDITURE OF ANY LOWER LOCAL. LOCAL FUNDS. AND. I KNOW I'VE HEARD. OVER MANY YEARS THAT. THE SECRET DOESN'T GET USED AS A TOOL. TO SHUT DOWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IN MY REGION. IT'D BEEN USED EVERY TIME TO DELAY ORDERS TO SHUT DOWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE A TRACK RECORD RECORD SHOWING UP AND ARGUING AGAINST ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE TOMORROW THERE'LL BE AN OPPORTUNITY CAN. TO SOMEHOW DO IT. THERE IS A. AB FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THAT IT ACTUALLY IS AN AN AN OPINION FROM THEIR EDITORIAL BOARD HOW. SEQUENCE BEING USED AS FOR THE NEWBIES TO SHUT DOWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I THINK. PART OF THE REASON I REALLY LIKED THIS IDEA AND I'VE BEEN REALLY WORKING AT TRYING TO NARROW DOWN. I'M TRYING TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE INFILL PROJECTS AND TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I AM I MEET REGULARLY WITH RESIDENTS IN MY REGION AND THE PRICE OF APARTMENTS HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROUGH. AND I HAD A CONVERSATION VERY RECENTLY WHERE WITHIN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT I TALKED WITH HER RENT WENT UP A HUNDRED PERCENT FROM A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO TWO THOUSAND AND SHE WAS MOVING GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE OUT OF TOWN BECAUSE SHE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE. ON IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WHAT SHE TOLD ME IS THAT SHE WAS SCARED SHE WAS EMBARRASSED. AND SHE WAS. MORTIFIED. THAT. SHE WAS IN THIS SITUATION AND I ASKED HER WHY. WHY WOULD YOU FEEL THIS WAY WHY WOULD YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S YOUR FAULT AND SHE SAID BECAUSE LIKE I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PLAN BETTER? IT'S DRIVING PEOPLE OUT AND THEY'RE ASHAMED. THAT THE AB THEIR HOUSING SITUATION AND SO WE CAN'T WAIT. WE HAVE A DESPERATE NEED THAT THESE ARE THE POOREST COMMUNITIES IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT IT WOULD PROVIDE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN FEDERAL FOR FEDERAL DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AND THAT THE EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT WHEN THERE'S IN THE INVESTMENT. PRIVATE INVESTMENT INTO OUR THE POOREST OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WAGES GO UP PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE NEW BUSINESS STARTS IN THE AREA I THINK WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN AND THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS IS VERY SHORT SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THIS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ON. TO I THINK TO ALL OF US BUT IT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FROM MY COMMUNITY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. MS CABALLERO SO I. AS AS CHAIR DID NOT TO GIVE A RECOMMENDATION ON ON THIS. BILL I THINK SOME OF THE. QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE BILL. HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BY MISTER JONES OF THE SIERRA CLUB AND ALSO SOME RICE IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES. BUT. YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AND RECOGNIZE WHAT YOUR. DE ATTEMPTING TO DO A TO US SPUR INVESTMENT VESTMENTS CRITICALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE QUALIFIED OPPORTUNITY ZONES. LA AND SO WHILE I'M. NOT MAKING A RECOMMENDATION ON THE BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL LOOK AT THE SAME. TIME. MOVE THE BILL FORWARD INTO. CONTINUE ALLOW YOU TO TO WORK WITH YOUR OPPOSITION. SO. MOTION'S BEEN MADE WE NEED A SECOND. DO WE HAVE A SECOND. ROLL CALL PLEASE. ITEM THIRTY THREE A. B. THIRTY THIRTY BY CABALLERO THE MOTION IS TO PASS A REFER TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.

ZERO SIX A BILLS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TURN. THANKS TO. BECAUSE. THANK YOU. MR KILEY ITEM NUMBER TWENTY FIVE AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY SIX. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND DIE. FOR THAT REALLY HELPFUL COOPERATION IN THIS BILL AND I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS THE ROLE WHERE. LAST YEAR WILDFIRES BURNED ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FORTUNE ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES OF LAND. STRONG MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED STRUCTURES AND RESULTING IN AT LEAST FORTY SIX LOST LIVES. THESE FIRES AS WE KNOW DID NOT REMAIN CONFINED TO ON INHABITED AREAS THEY THREATEN THE COMMUNITIES OF LOS ANGELES AND SANTA ROSA ROSA. PROMPTING MANDATORY EVACUATIONS SPARTAN BICU ON THE LIVES OF MANY MANY CALIFORNIANS. THE THOMAS FIRE WAS THE LARGEST FIRE EVER RECORDED IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY BURNING OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA A BLAZE BIG ENOUGH TO ENGULF WASHINGTON DC. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKES STEPS TO ADDRESS THE PIRATES THE CRISP EXIST ACROSS OUR STATE NIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. IN THOSE VERY EFFORTS MOVE THE BILL. ONE MAJOR ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA IS THE VAST AMOUNT OF UNDER MANAGED STATE OWNED LAND WITH EXCESS DEBRIS AND BRUSH THAT POSES A FIRE HAZARD. IN MANY AREAS INCLUDING MY OWN THIS LAND IS DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO PRIVATELY OWNED OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OWNED PROPERTY. WELL I THIS STATE OWNED LAND CAN POSE  SIGNIFICANT FIRE HAZARD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS ARE OFTEN HONEY UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THESE RISKS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING PRIVATE LAND ROVERS OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO REQUEST THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION TO REDUCE SERVICE FUELS ON STATE LANDS THE LAND THAT IS WITHIN THREE HUNDRED FEET OF A STRUCTURE LOCATED ON PRIVATE. OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OWNED PROPERTY THE BILL HAS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED WILL REQUIRE THE PARKS DEPARTMENT TO CONSULT WITH CAL FIRE AND BEGIN WORKON THE AREA WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF COMPLETING ALL THE NECESSARY PLANNING. AND PERMITS THE SCOPE WOULD BE LIMITED TO LAND MANAGED BY THE PARKS DEPARTMENT THAT IS ALSO FULLY OR PARTIALLY WITHIN A STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA THAT YOU AMENDMENTS ALSO AT A FIVE YEAR SUNSET THE BILL. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS FROM THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF WILD FIRES THAT CONTINUE TO THREATEN OUR STATE. THE BILL WILL HELP ASSURE CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT PUT AT UNNECESSARY RISK BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT MAINTAINED ITS OWN LAND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL. ABOUT THIS BILL AND THE RISKS IN MY DISTRICT IS UP BE LUPE RODRIGUEZ THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF FOLSOM. YOU NEED A GOOD AFTERNOON ACTUALLY I MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SLEEPER RODRIGUEZ SOME FIRE CHIEF THE CITY OF FOLSOM. I DO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. AS YOU KNOW FULSOME IS IN AN AREA THAT. BORDERS A STATE PARKS LAND AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA LANDS AS. DESCRIBE WITHIN THE BILL. AND WE HAVE SOME AREAS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT OVER GROUND THAT ARE. ADJACENT TO STRUCTURES NOW WITHIN ANY OF THE CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL AREAS NORMALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST OR ACTUALLY REGULATE THE THE LANDS OWNED BY PRIVATE OWNERS TO. HAVE SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THE STRUCTURES UP TO THE PROPERTY LINE. BUT IN OUR CASE AS IN MANY OTHER CASES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT EXCEEDS PASSED THE PROPERTY LINE. WITH SOME VEGETATION THAT'S NEAR THE STRUCTURE SO WE'RE ASKING SOME SUPPORT ON THIS TO ALLOW THE HOMEOWNERS AND OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CHIEFS AT SUCH AS MYSELF TO. HAVE STATE PARKS REGULATE OUR TAKE CARE OF THAT LAND THAT'S CLOSE OF STRUCTURES AND HOPEFULLY PULL LITTLE BIT OF A BUFFER BETWEEN THE HOMES. AND. THE VEGETATION THAT'S OF CONCERN WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A CLEAR CUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST SOME LATTER FUEL REDUCTION AND OTHER REMOVAL OF SOME OF THOSE SURFACED FUELS TO ALLOW THE FIREFIGHTERS TO GET IN THERE AND AT LEAST TRY TO. PREVENT ONE OF THOSE FIRES FROM SPREADING INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AS WE HAD LAST YEAR SO I WITH THAT I SUPPORT YOU WILL NOT BE. OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHIEF OF FOR. YOUR ANY FURTHER WITNESSES THIS BILL DOES HAVE A SUPPORT SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION. YEAH WE GOT IT WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT SO THAT THIS BILL WILL DEFINITELY HELP HOMEOWNERS COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAW BUT ALSO IMPAIR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR. THING. AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IN A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MOTIONS MADE AND SECONDED BY MISTER CRAWLEY WHICH LIKE CLOTHES THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK BERNADETTE THANKS VERY MUCH. ROLL CALL PLEASE. I DON'T TWENTY FIVE AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY SIX BY MEMBER KILEY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED IN REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI AYE REFUGEE AYE ACOSTA. AYE AYE ACOSTA AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. FLORA. FLORA I LIMON. MCCARTY. MCCARTY I MELENDEZ MULLIN DESIRAY YES. VARIOUS AYE STONE. STONE I. SEVEN ZERO BILLS OUT THANKFULLY. ALRIGHT THE NEXT WE HAVE MISTER DALY ITEM NUMBER THIRTY SIX AB THIRTY TWO ZERO ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. LET ME START BY. HIGHLIGHTING THAT I HAVE AGREED WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE. OPPOSED BY. CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. OH OKAY. THE ISSUE WAS IN THE ANALYSIS EXCUSE ME. THIS MEASURE ALLOWS LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE INCENTIVE FUNDING. AS THEY TRANSITION TO A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ZERO EMISSION STATEWIDE TRANSIT BUS FLEET. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS RELEASED TO PROPOSE REGULATORY CONCEPT TO ACHIEVE ZERO EMISSION TRANSIT SYSTEM BY TWENTY FORTY. THIS LAUDABLE GOAL HAS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AND WILL HELP CALIFORNIA MEET OUR AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE TARGETS. WITH THIS WITH TRANSITION WILL COME ADDITIONAL COST PRESSURES ON TRANSIT AGENCIES. WHICH ALREADY OPERATE ON SMALL MARGINS. PRICE FOR ZERO EMISSION BUS CAN BE THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. MORE EXPENSIVE OF COURSE THAN CONVENTIONAL BUSES. AS OF A FEW MONTHS AGO TRANSIT AGENCIES IN OUR STATE HAD ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN ZERO EMISSION BUSES IN OPERATION WITH AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED FORTY ON ORDER. ALL OF THESE WERE PURCHASED WITH THE HELP OF INCENTIVE FUNDING AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT INCENTIVE FUNDING. ON TOP OF THE UP FRONT COST PRESSURES TO PURCHASE THESE MORE EXPENSIVE BUSES TRANSIT AGENCIES MUST ALSO FUND AND CREATE A COMPLETELY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A ZERO EMISSION BUS FULLY. IT'S VITAL THAT FUNDING REMAIN AVAILABLE IN ORDER FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES TO SUCCESSFULLY MAKE THE RAPID TRANSITION. TO A ZERO EMISSION BUS FLEET WHICH WE HOPE THEY WILL DO. THE LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE. AGREED TO IN THE AMENDMENT WILL NARROW THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL BY ELIMINATING THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF INCENTIVE FUNDS TO MEET REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND REMOVING THE PROPOSED LONG TERM OUTLOOK INVESTMENT PLAN RESTORING IT. TO THE CURRENT ANNUAL REQUIREMENT. WITH THESE AMENDMENTS. THIS BILL SIMPLY ADDS INFRASTRUCTURE AND LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENTS OF TRANSIT BUSES TO THE LIST OF PROJECTS THAT MAY RECEIVE THIS ESSENTIAL FUNDING. WITH ME IS MICHAEL PIEMAN TALL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION. AND MORE ATOP REPRESENTING THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL HIMSELF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSIT ASSOCIATION. ONE I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAILY FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE AND FOR SO ABLY ARTICULATED IN THE LANDSCAPE THE FUNDING LANDSCAPE THE MY TRANSIT AGENCY MEMBERS ARE OPERATING AND. DISPOSED SIMPLY STATES IT IS TRANSIT AGENCIES WILL OUT THERE ZERO EMISSION BUSES AND ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENT LARGE SCALE PROJECTS THE STATE SHOULD CONTINUE PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THEM. INCLUDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AS A WIN FOR TRANSIT AGENCIES AS A HELP SOME STRETCHED THEIR STATE AND FEDERAL FORMULA DOLLARS WHILE ADVANCING ZERO MISSION TECHNOLOGIES. AND THE BILL IS ALSO WIN FOR THE TRANST RIDERS WHO WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM CLEARING PART OF BUSES ALONGSIDE STRONG TRANSIT SERVICE. A VOTE FOR A B. THIRTY TWO A ONE. TODAY REAFFIRMED OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING ROBUST FUNDING TO SUPPORT YOUR MISSION BUS DEPLOYMENT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR A TOP ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. ó WE CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT. THAT MOVING TO CLEANER FLORA FLEETS IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE WERE COMMITTED TO IT BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I'D FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ROBERTS WHO WAS SHOT HERE AND WE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA'S BIG BLUE BUS THE SANTA CRUZ METROPOLITAN TRANSIT DISTRICT. THE LOS ANDES THERE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. ALL IN SUPPORT OF WAS ALSO ASKED TO CONVEY THE SUPPORT OF GUARDINO TRANSIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE. OPPOSITION. BUT GOOD AFTERNOON AT YOUR MERCY SHE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I'M RYAN KENNY WITH CLEAN ENERGY AND ALSO REPRESENTING THAT YOU WERE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS A CONFERENCE CALIFORNIA GAS AND VEHICLE COALITION. AND THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL HAS A FATAL FLAW BECAUSE IT IS INSERTING A NEW PROJECT A CATEGORY LARGE SCALE ON THE PLANET OF TRANSIT BUSES. WHERE THERE WASN'T BEFORE AND? WITH DUE RESPECT THE AUTHOR INTO THE SPONSOR WIDGET DID PROPOSE AN AMENDMENT OF CAPPING THAT NEW INCLUSION AT NO MORE THAN TEN PERCENT. AND IT WAS NOT ACCEPTED AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CONCLUSION IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. AND I THINK THAT'SWHY AIR BE IS LOOKING UNDER EVERY ROCK FOR FUNDING AND THAT WILL BE. THIS IS THAT THE NEW. VEHICLE TO TO DO SO FOR THE INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT RULE. SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE ISN'T ANY AYE COST CONTAINMENT. AND THAT THE EXISTING. PROJECTS WITHIN THE CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS. PROGRAM WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE TO THAT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS PREFERABLY. WITH THIS THIS NEW INCLUSION SO WE DO ASK THAT THE BILL LATIN NOT GO FORWARD OR AT LEAST BE AMENDED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF COST DE CAP. SO THAT THE OTHER PROJECTS CAN ENJOY A CERTAINTY AND THAT BUSINESS THAT. PLANNING CAN CAN CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED HOW WE ALSO BELIEVE THE BILL IS PREMATURE AND AT THE. INNOVATIVE CLEAN CHANCE A RULE AT AIR BE SHOULD FIRST BE ADOPTED BEFORE A FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT IS IDENTIFIED THANK YOU. I'M CATHERINE PHILLIPS WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN AN OF OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK AND THE WORK THAT THE STAFF DID IN. I AM I DO WANNA SAY THAT I THINK THE REST OF THE BILL IS A IS GOOD IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO. A BERKELEY MENTION. DEPLOYMENTS OF OF. FLEETS. THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN ELIGIBLE BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN MAKING IT VERY CLEAR ADDITIONALLY JUST SO YOU ALL KNOW. ON THE TWENTY FIFTH. TWENTY FIFTH OF THIS MONTH THE CARDBOARD WILL BE VOTING ON HOW TO DISTRIBUTE SOME. VW SETTLEMENT MONEY AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION IS TARGETED TO GO TOWARDS TRANSIT BUSES SCHOOL BUSES. AND AND THE SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER KIND OF A SHUTTLE BUS. BETTER ZERO MISSION SO THERE WILL BE MONEY OUT THERE. AND SO ALL YOU TRANSIT PEOPLE GET ONLINE BEFORE THE RULE COMES OUT NOW'S THE TIME TO DO IT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. AND FOR THEIR OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL. XENA AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I TO HAVE A QUESTION OF MS PHILLIPS. IS CLC VIS POSITION IN OPPOSITION ON THE CEMENT THAT ARE YOU REQUESTING CERTAIN A MADMAN SIERRA CLUB IS REMOTE. AT SORRY AND THAT'S A GOOD CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I FAILED TO SAY WE'RE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION THREE GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE MISTER DALY AYE. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. YOU'RE. LEADERSHIP AND HELPING. OR. ACHIEVE ZERO NEAR ARE ZERO EMISSION KNOW TRUCK BUS AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES. AS WELL AS. PORT INFRASTRUCTURE. NIGHT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE THE CLEAN ENERGY IS ARGUMENTS ABOUT. PICKING. WINNERS AND LOSERS AND ALSO. CONCERN RAISED ABOUT. IN THE ANALYSIS. ABOUT. THE. USING THE DOLLARS BREAK FROM TRADITION IN IN USING THE DOLLARS FOR. FOR COMPLIANCE. DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT. WILL I THINK A OR B. WILL ULTIMATELY MAKE THE DECISION THE GOAL HERE. I MEAN I WAS ON A LOCAL TRANSIT BOARD IN ORANGE COUNTY. ARM. THESE. PUBLICLY FUNDED. BUS SYSTEMS DON'T HAVE AN ANALYST'S AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO BUY EXPENSIVE NEW TECHNOLOGY. THEY ALREADY SUBSIDIZE THE BUS FARES WE ALL SUBSIDIZE BUS FARES. IN MY DISTRICT. THERE'S NO ROOM TO RAISE BUS FARES. AND. IN FACT RIDERSHIP IS DECLINING BECAUSE OF OTHER. SOCIETAL TRENDS BUT. IT SEEMS TO ME IF THE STATE IS GOING TO MANDATE EXPENSIVE NEW VEHICLES ST OUGHT TO HAVE A WAY. TO HELP. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PAY FOR THOSE. THOSE SO. THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY. SO I THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S APPROACH IN THE PAST WE NEED WE MAY NEED MORE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE BUT I THINK TO. TO MAKE LOCAL TRANSIT AGENCIES IN ELIGIBLE. TO COMPETE. IS A STEP SIDEWAYS OR BACKWARDS SO ULTIMATELY A OR B. WILL BE MAKING THIS DECISION WHETHER YOU WANT TO CHARACTERIZE IT IS PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS I WOULDN'T. I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT THAT WAY I THINK IT'S IT'S ABOUT PROGRESS IN ZERO EMISSIONS. I THINK WE WON IT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE A ARE BE. TO. TO. TO HELP THESE LOCAL AGENCIES TRANSITION THAT'S THE GOAL SO I THINK WE'RE ALL WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL IT'S HAD A WE GET THERE. SHE LIKED TO GET WE TAKE THAT AS YOU CLOSE YES SIR AND I APPRECIATE YOU WAS A PROPOSING THE AMENDMENT AND. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION APPRECIATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

IN SOME COUNTY WELFARE IS WORSENED AT AND EXISTING SEVERE HOUSING SHORTAGE. BY OUR HOUSE WILDFIRES DESTROYED MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND HOMES IN THE COUNTY. AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY SEVEN WOULD ALLOW WILD FERRET DAMAGE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING TO REAP BE REPLACED OR REBUILT. AT A FIFTY PERCENT HIGHER DENSITY CURLY THIS DENSITY BONUS ONLY APPLIES TO SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD ADD SPECIFIC WHILE FOR DAMAGE. DAMAGE HOUSING LANGUAGE INTO SEQUEL GUIDELINES AND CLARIFY THAT THESE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SEQUEL CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS. THE BILL WOULD NOT PREVIOUSLY PRE EXEMPT ARE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS EXCEPTIONS CURRENTLY LISTED IN THE SEQUEL GUIDELINES. OFTENTIMES WHEN REBUILDING A HOME A HOMEOWNER OFTEN WANTS TO EXPAND OUR MAKE ADDITIONS ON THEIR EXISTING PROPERTY. THE ALLOWANCE OF A HIGHER DENSITY CAN INCENTIVIZE HOMEOWNERS TO REBUILD AND HELP INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY. A REALIZATION OF PROPERTY AS AS AT THAT THIS TIME WOULD ONLY EXASPERATED A HOUSING CRISIS AND WOULD REPRESENT A LOST OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD SMARTER. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS PAUL YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF CINEMA COUNTY. WELL YEAH. NO ON. MISTER CHAIRMAN OTHER MEMBERS SPOILER SHUDDER AND TO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR AWHILE SO I'M GONNA VERY BRIEFLY JUST STATE THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE FIVE THOUSAND HOMES.

I TRIED BE BRIEF SINCE I KNOW THE SUSPEND ALONG HEARING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT OUR HISTORIC APPROACH TO FIRE IS INADEQUATE. WORLD'S GETTING WARMER TRYOUTS REFLECTING CALIFORNIA AND EVERY YEAR THE VEGETATION GROWS CREATING MORE AND MORE FUEL THE STATUS QUO. KEEPS DIGGING A DEEPER HOLE IN EACH YEAR WERE SEEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES. THE COST OF FIGHTING THESE FIRES IS ASTOUNDING WE SPENT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE EMERGENCY FUND IN FIVE OF THE LAST SIX YEARS FIGHTING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. OVER TWO BILLION IN THE LAST THREE YEARS ALONE. MOREOVER DATA SUGGESTS THAT IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS FIRES OF ADMITTED MORE CARBON THAN EVERY TAILPIPE IN THE STATE COMBINED. THE TUBS FIRE IN MY DISTRICT SINGLE HANDEDLY ADMITTED MORE CARBON IN ONE WEEK THAN EVERY TAILPIPE IN THE STATE DOES OVER AN ENTIRE YEAR. WHILE ACCOUNTS YEAR QUALITY OCTOBER IN CINEMA AND NAPA COUNTY WAS THE WORST ON RECORD AND THE HEALTH PACKED HEALTH IMPACTS WERE REMARKABLE. ACCORDING TO A STUDY RELEASED IN THE JOURNAL THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION SMOKY AIR IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRES WAS ASSOCIATE WITH THE FORTY TWO PERCENT. OF THE HIGHER RISK OF HEART ATTACK COMPARED TO SMOKE FREE AIR AT TWENTY TWO PERCENT RELATIVE RISK OF EMERGENCY VISITS FOR CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. NORTH BAY FIRES THAT HAVE DEVASTATED LARGE PARTS OF MY DISTRICT IN OCTOBER WAS THE MOST COSTLY FIRESTORM IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY. THE IMPACT OF THE EVENTS LIKE THIS CANNOT BE MEASURED IN DOLLARS AND CENTS. THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES LOST EVERYTHING THEY OWN AND DOZENS LOST THEIR LIVES. THE TIMES FIRE CHANGE MY COMMUNITY FOR EVER. JUST OVER SIXTY DAYS LATER THE THOMAS FIRE AGAIN FUELED BY HIGH WINDS AND BADLY NEGLECTED LANCE BECAME THE LARGEST FIRE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. LET'S MAKE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRE SIXTIES AND THE LAST FINAL WAKEUP CALL. MUST CHANGE THE WAY WE MANAGE OUR LANCE RESTORE RESILIENCE MUST ACCEPT THAT WE HAVE TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. MUST TAKE MAKE THE INVESTMENT OUR NATIONAL WORKING LANDS IS THERE STILL ARE MOST POWERFUL CLIENT CLIMATE CHANGE RESOURCES. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY ONE AS PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE BILL CREATES A JOINT BURNER PROGRAM WITH CAL FIRE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE DEPARTMENTS COLLABORATE WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS ON PROACTIVE FIRES. IT PROVIDES LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES TO CAL FIRE FOR THE FOREST HEALTH PROGRAM SO WE'RE PROVIDING SOME GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW TO INVEST THOSE FUNDS. NAY CALLS FOR INVESTING UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO. PUT FOR FIRE PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE HEALTHY FORCE PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY FIRE PROTECTION EFFORTS THAT WERE ADDRESSED TO MISS ALONE SPELL OUT LAST THAT WAS HER LAST WEEK. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS PAUL MASON WITH THE PACIFIC FOR STRESS.

DURING AN ACT OF FIRE INCIDENT. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY WILL REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION TO COLLABORATE ON REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE OPERATIONS OF EQUIPMENT. THIS BILL IS A DIRECT RESULT OF COMMUNICATION I HAD WITH OH YES. CALIFORNIA AND MS MYDLINK LIMON. REGARDING FIRE IG REGARDING EXISTING PRACTICES FOLLOWING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES. FIREFIGHTERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE WORKS TO FIGHT THESE FIRES AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE OF PRIVATELY CONTRACTED FIRE RESOURCES. THIS PART CONFUSION AND I'M QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW PRIVATE RESOURCES INTERACT WITH STATE LOCAL RESOURCES. REPORTS INDICATED THAT THE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS IN THEIR CRIMINAL WERE UNDISTINGUISHED OVAL FROM THAT OF THE PUBLI FIREFIGHTING AGENCIES. AB TWENTY TWENTY EIGHTY WILL PUT AN END TO THE PUBLIC CONFUSION ABOUT WHERE THE FIRE RESOURCES ARE PUBLIC FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PRIVATELY CONTRACTED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES.

I HAVE WITH ME TODAY DOUG SUPERS WITH THE PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST OBSERVERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS.

AND CONCEPTS AND STANDARDS WERE DEVELOPED A FIRE SCOPE WHICH IS A LEGISLATIVELY ESTABLISHED BODY THAT BRINGS THE FIRE SERVICE TOGETHER STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL TO TALK ABOUT WAYS TO BETTER. INTERACT AND. OPERATE ON INCIDENTS WE THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL TAKE THE GUIDELINES THAT ARE ALREADY DEVELOPED AND FOLLOWED PUT THEM INTO STATE LAW TO ENSURE THAT THE COORDINATION IS CLEAR. WHETHER THEY INCIDENT COMMAND IS RUN BY THE STATE OR LOCAL BODY OR ANOTHER REGIONAL BODY FOR THOSE REASONS WE. ASK FOR SUPPORT NEXT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

ALRIGHT NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER SIX. AB TWENTY TWO OH EIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S. AB TWENTY TWO OH IT WILL PROVIDE A NECESSARY COURSE CORRECTION FOR THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS PROGRAM. AS WE MOVE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT TOWARD FIFTY PERCENT AND BEYOND ARE RENEWALS ARE OUT OF BALANCE AND LESS DIVERSE. THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF WIND AND ESPECIALLY SOLAR. WHICH ARE VALUABLE BUT INTERMITTENT RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME BIO ENERGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES HAVE NOT GROWN. MANY FACILITIES HAVE CLOSED AND MANY MORE WILL BE COMING OFF LINE WITHOUT BEING RE CONTRACTED IN THE COMING YEARS. BEFORE HE REACHED FIFTY PERCENT ARE PS MARK WE'RE ON TRACK TO LOSE VALUABLE RESOURCES THAT THE STATE HAS A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN PRESERVING. THESE AREN'T RESOURCES ARE VALUABLE NOT ONLY TO SMOOTH THE GRID IMBALANCES BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL BENT BENEFITS TO THE STATE. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LARGE GEOTHERMAL FACILITY THOSE PROVIDED HIGH WAGE JOBS REDUCE. DECADES. MY CONSTITUENTS CONSTITUENTS CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THOSE JOBS. WE ALSO CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THE GRID BENEFIT THE GEYSERS PROVIDE TO CALIFORNIA. THE RELIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY THE KIDS THE LIGHTS ON AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS THAT SHINING. THAT FACILITY ALSO TRADE TREATS WASTEWATER AND HAS HELPED CLEAN UP WILD RIVERS LIKE THE RUSSIAN RIVER. THESE RIVERS FACE INCREASING ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION FROM WALLFLOWER FIRES AND LANDSLIDES IN A NEW ERA OF EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. CALIFORNIA'S AN AGRICULTURAL STATE I HAVE A LOAN OF FAR MYSELF WITH MOUNDS OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE WITHOUT A PLACE TO GO. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO CONVERT AGRICULTURAL WASTE IN THE BIO ENERGY. WE SHOULD BE USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO VIA A TO AVOID THE SORT OF OPEN BURNS WE SAW LAST YEAR THAT FURTHER POLLUTED OUR AIR AND WATER IN THE WILDFIRES. WE PHASE A RAMPANT FIRE WILD FIRES THAT DEVASTATE OUR ENVIRONMENT WATER SUPPLY CLIMATE GOALS AIR QUALITY. AND ULTIMATELY OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. NUMEROUS STATE AGENCIES HAVE WEIGHED IN ON THIS ISSUE MANY OF CONCLUDED THE FILE ENERGY IS ONE OF THE BEST IN USES FOR FOREST WASTE. TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE AGAINST WILDFIRES. WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES IN OUR FOREST DUE TO DROUGHT AND BARK BEETLE INFESTATIONS. THESE TREES ARE ESSENTIALLY KINDLING FOR THE FUTURE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WILD FIRES CANCEL OUT THE GAINS WE MAKE TO OUR G. H. G. AND SHORT LIVED CLIMATE REDUCTION GOALS. WE NEED TO AGGRESSIVELY AND IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO REVERSE THIS WILDFIRE SIDE SAGA AND THE STATE'S BIO ENERGY RESOURCES MUST BE AN ASPECT OF THAT PREVENTION AND MITIGATION. I KNOW THE PHONE I KNOW THE FOLKS HAVE RAISED ISSUES ABOUT THE COST OF GEOTHERMALAND BIOENERGY. BUT THE PENSKE IS A BUT THAT BUT VALUE IN THESE RESOURCES ON A COST PER MEGAWATT BASIS IGNORES THE HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC VALUES THESE RESOURCES BRING TO THE STATE. WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ONE CATASTROPHIC FILE IN MY DISTRICT IS ALREADY OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN INSURANCE CLAIMS ALONE. FAILING TO CONSIDER THESE ADDITIONAL COST FOR REPAIRS AND OUR STATE FAILS TO EVALUATE THE THIS ISSUE FROM A COMPREHENSIVE. I ALSO KNOW FOLKS HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT AIR QUALITY AROUND SOME BIOMASS FOR US FACILITIES. WE KNOW THE BIOMASS ENERGY IS FAR BETTER ALTERNATIVE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR AIR QUALITY THAT OPEN BURNING A RAPID FIRES. BUT I AGREED THE STATE CAN DO BETTER TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. HOLLYWOOD BIOMASS FACILITY IS LOCATED IN EXTREME NON ATTAINMENT AREA. I COMMIT TO YOU. I WANT TO REPEAT THAT I COMMIT TO YOU SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FOR TODAY I WILL AMEND THE BILL TO REQUIRE. IMPROVEMENTS IN HIT AIR QUALITY TECHNOLOGIES FOR BIOMASS. FINALLY IF THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU I ASK THAT YOU BE MY PARTNER. IN MOVING THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FORWARD SO WE CAN GET THIS DONE RIGHT. A PROCESS NOW OFF TO MY A JOINT AUTHORS MR GARCIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRED COLLEAGUES ARE PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. POINT TO AWAIT CONJUNCTION WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM WINTERS. A BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROMOTE THE USE OF PROCUREMENT OF SPECIFIC RENEWABLE RESOURCES. WITHIN THE EXISTING APPIAH'S FRAMEWORK. TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLIMATE AND ENERGY GOALS. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I AUTHORED AB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN THAT DIRECTED THE STATE TO ENSURE EMISSION REDUCTIONS WERE HAPPENING IN OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES. THIS MEANS IT'S JUST NOT ABOUT SETTING STATEWIDE STANDARDS BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT ENSURING SIGNIFICANT CO BENEFITS. I REALIZE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE'RE MOVING TOWARD INTEGRATING OTHER. DIVERS RESOURCES SUCH AS DETERMINED BY OF ENERGY WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE CURRENT COST OF DOING NOTHING. NON THAT NOTE OF COST IT IS OFTEN SAID THAT JILL THERMAL. IS SOMETHING THAT COST A LOT MORE THAN MANY OF THE OTHER RENEWABLE. ENERGY RESOURCES AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT IN MY DISTRICT. THE HIGH LEVEL OF INVESTMENT AND SOLAR AND WIND HAS BEEN A VERY POSITIVE THING. AS IT RELATES TO CREATING JOBS AND IMPROVING THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF IMPAIR COUNTY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE HIGH PENETRATION OF THESE INTERMITTENTLY SOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR WIND. CURRENT CREATE. COST PRESSURES DUE TO THE NEED OF NATURAL GAS PLANTS. AND NOT TO MENTION THE EXTERNAL COSTS. TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY SOME OF OUR ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE COMMUNITY. MEMBERS ARE IN OUR DISTRICT. WHEN THESE KINDS OF COSTS ARE NOT QUANTIFY COLLECTIVELY. IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES OF WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF GEOTHERMAL AND OTHER RENEWABLES. ONE THING WE DO KNOW FROM THE INDEPENDENT SOURCES SUCH AS THE STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY. IS AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF GUILT THE MORE RESOURCES AT THE SALTON SEA. IT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND WOULD SAVE ENERGY CONSUMERS ABOUT THREE SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION PER YEAR. TODAY THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AN APPEAL COUNTY IS SIXTEEN PERCENT. THE SECOND HIGHEST IN THE STATE NEXT TO COLUSA COUNTY. IF YOU YEARS AGO THIS COUNTY HAD THE HIGHESTUNEMPLOYMENT. IN THE NATION WITH TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT ALMOST A THIRD OF ITS POPULATION. MEMBERS WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE HUNDREDS A GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THE PART OF THE STATE THE SUFFERS FROM STUBBORNLY HIGH. UNEMPLOYMENT WHILE ADDRESSING SOME OF OUR GREATEST AIR QUALITY AND ECOLOGICAL THREATS AT THE SOLVENCY. THIS IS WHY AB TWENTY TWO AWAY IS SO IMPORTANT TO US AND WHITE IT ENJOYS THE STRONG SUPPORT. OF ALL OF OUR. STAKEHOLDERS IN A PILL COUNTY INCLUDING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I'M PARA IRRIGATION DISTRICT AND NUMEROUS. DEVELOPERS INCLUDING OR MATT CAL ENERGY ENERGY SOURCE CONTROLLED THE MORE RESOURCES TO NAME A FEW OF THE GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPERS IN THE REGION. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED IN THE LAST COMMITTEE. SUPPORT THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS BEFORE THE CPUC. UNFORTUNATELY APPEAL COUNTY DOES NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF THE TIME. TO WAIT ON THE I RP. WE NEED TO PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREATING COMPANIES. TO THOSE RISK VALUABLE INVESTMENTS. IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTRUCTION COSTS TO BUILD THESE FACILITIES NOW. THE STATE HAS KICK STARTED ITS INVESTMENT IN MITIGATION PROJECTS NECESSARY FOR HEALTH AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY. NOT ONLY FOR COMMUNITIES IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE SCENE. BUT THE ENTIRE STATE. THIS BILL WILL HELP MOVE THE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES FORWARD NOW. IN ADDITION THERE IS A NEED TO REDUCE THE STATE'S CURRENT A STARK DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED COAL FROM NEIGHBORING STATES. IN ANTICIPATION TO TRANSITIONING TO A GREEN ECONOMY. AGAIN THIS IS THE TIME TO BETTER COORDINATE AND INTEGRATE GREAT BALANCING RESOURCES TO AN ENERGY PORTFOLIO THAT URGENTLY NEEDS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS REGARDING MOVING THIS LEGISLATION THAT IS NOT FULLY DEVELOPED. HOWEVER WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. WITH US TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE RICH GORDON WITH CALIFORNIA'S AND KELLY BOYD WITH THE LOW CARBON FUEL ENERGY COALITION AND OTHERS THANK YOU. THE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS A I I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES IN THEIR COSTS. SO LET ME TELL YOU WHY. DESPITE THOSE CONCERNS YOU SHOULD MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY. IT'S AN ARGUMENT BASED ON THE ENVIRONMENT. ARE FORCE OR SIMPLY OVERGROWN. WHEN THE EUROPEANS ARRIVED IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD ABOUT FORTY TREES TO AN ACRE. TODAY THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF TREES TO AN ACRE. THIS OVER GROWTH LEADS TO TREE MORTALITY INCREASED FUEL FOR DEVASTATING FIRES. FORCED HEALTH IT WILL REQUIRE THINNING OUR FORESTS. THE MATERIAL LEFT FROM THINNING IS BIOMASS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THIS MATERIAL CAN BE BURNED ON SITE. RELEASING CARBON OTHER NOXIOUS GASES. OR IT BE LEFT ON SITE A IN THEIR IT STAYS IS FUEL. FOR FUTURE FIRES. THE THIRD CHOICE ETERNITY AND ENERGY. CONVERSATION THIS YEAR ABOUT WILDFIRES FORCED HEALTH CARBON SEQUESTRATION. AND THE ENVIRONMENT WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT BIOMASS. YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THAT CONVERSATION BY MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD. THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT DEALS WITH BIOMASS IN THIS MANNER. MOVING THIS BILL THE SHORES OF THE ASSEMBLY WILL REMAIN IN THE BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT WILDFIRES AND FORCED HEALTH AND FOR THAT REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND THINKING GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE KELLY BOARD ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL AND ENERGY COALITION I'M AYE ONE ECHO. THE REMARKS OF THIS. THE AUTHORS ANDA AND MISTER GORDON AND STRESSED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE NEED TO START CO MINGLING HOW WERE ADDRESSING OUR PROGRAMS AND IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE OUR PS ARE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND DEAL WITH CLIMATE ADAPTATION WE NEED TO MAKE BEST USE OF THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. IN OUR OUR PS ARSENAL. BIOMASS AND GEOTHERMAL POWER GRID BALANCING RESOURCES THEY WILL ALLOW US TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE GRID GOING FORWARD WE WON'T HAVE TO. PURCHASE AS MUCH NEW DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION MORE IMPORTANTLY AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT HERE. THEY'LL HELP US TO AVOID AND NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THE CARBON THAT WOULD OTHERWISE. BE ADMITTED INTO THE AIR BY OPEN BURNING FROM OTHER SOURCES THEY WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO ARM ATTAIN OUR LANDFILL REDUCTION OBJECTIVES THESE ARE KEY RESOURCES THEY'RE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TO THE GRID. THE EXISTING FORTY TWO COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING IN SOME OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DISADVANTAGED REGIONS WE NEED TO KEEP THE JOBS THERE WE NEED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON NOT AN. ENVIRONMENTAL EQUITY IN THOSE REGIONS AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE CALPERS THE PATRIOTS COUNCIL THE WESTERN CITY COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS TO STAY ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES IN LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. I I THINK YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THE JOB'S IMPLICATIONS OF THE BILL BUT I TWENTY THREE. POINTS. WHEN WE CLOSED OF THE SENATE NO FOR NUCLEAR. OPERATING STATION AND WE LOST TWENTY TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF CLEAN GHG FREE NUCLEAR POWER. THE SOLUTION TO SOLVE THE WHOLE IN THE LA BASIN. BY THE CPUC AND BY THE CAL I SO WAS TO BUILD A SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR TRANSMISSION LINE WITH CALIFORNIA REPAIR MONEY. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA TO BRING IN MORE NATURAL GAS FIRED POWER TO CALIFORNIA. WE ARE NOW GOING TO DECOMMISSION DE DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR POWER STATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FIVE THEY WERE GONNA LOSE ANOTHER TWENTY TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF GHG FREE. POWER LET'S NOT MAKE THAT SAME MISTAKE TWICE LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GEOTHERMAL IN THE BIO MASS THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. AND NOT REPLACE IT WITHOUT A STATE NATURAL GAS ON THE COST ISSUE I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT. THAT IF THE OPPONENTS ARGUMENTS ON COST WOULD HAVE PREVAILED ABOUT A DECADE AGO. WE WOULD NOT HAVE ROOFTOP SOLAR IN CALIFORNIA. WE WOULD NOT HAVE SPENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF REPAIR MONEY ON A CSI PROGRAM FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR. SO THAT'S NOT A VALID ARGUMENT FOR THE SAME INDUSTRIES TO MAKE TODAY. LET'S GET THIS BUILT AND IT AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THE LIFE CYCLE COSTS. ARE ACTUALLY BETTER. DIDN'T CERTAIN TYPES OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY. THE LIFE CYCLE COSTS OF A GEOTHERMAL FACILITY FOR INSTANCE OR A NEW BIOMASS FACILITY IS IT'S GOING TO LAST LONGER YOU GONNA GET A BIGGER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. THEN. DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD A ORIGIN I THINK YOU. THE COMMISSION CHAIRMAN MR COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN SUPPORT. TO THE ELEVEN BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT. YOU LEAVE ALLEN ASKING ALL OF YOU HAVE A CALIFORNIA BY A MASS ENERGY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT.

AS CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS ANDY HARM THE DEPUTY CEO FOR NATURAL RESOURCE FOR THE COUNTY OF IMPERIAL HER TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SUASANA HERE LABOR STATE COUNCIL SUPPORT. CHAIRMAN EMERITUS WITH YOUR PERMISSION LIKE DEAL TWEENER THING LOOKS AGREED ON SPORT EMPLOYER SHUDDER INTO A WE HAVE THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL IN GENERAL. DISRESPECTFULLY IS POSSIBLE WOULD LIKE SEE THE SPECIFIC REFERENCES SOLVENCY TAKEN OUT AND SUBSTITUTED FOR WITH BASELOAD. BASIL RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES THANK YOU. ALRIGHT AND FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF THE. PROPONENTS CAN. YEAH CLEAR THE SEATS THANK YOU. BUT. THANK YOU MELISSA CORTEZ ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY HERE IN OPPOSITION. ALL WE DO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES HOWEVER THE RPF HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN. TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND I THINK THE SUCCESS OF THE OUR PS IS BECAUSE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY. IT'S ALLOWED THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TO COMPETE HICH HAS BROUGHT THE REACHED THE COST OF THESE RESOURCES DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE OUR PS WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE JOB BENEFITS THAT CERTAIN RESOURCES HAVE WHETHER IT'S YOU GET SHE. AND ACCOUNT YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT COST BUT WE DO SUPPORT THE IRP PROCESS TO. LOOK AT THESE TYPES OF PROCUREMENT DECISIONS THAT IRP PROCESS WHICH IS JUST ITS INFANCY LOOK THAT NOT JUST COST BUT ALSO LOOK THAT GHGS AND GREATER RELIABILITY WE THINK THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THESE TYPES OF PROCUREMENT DECISIONS. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TWENTY HUNTER ON BEHALF OF THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION. SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT AND ON BEHALF OF MY COLLECTION ANY AT THE LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALL OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS. AS PROPOSED THINK WE ARE ALL ON. SYMPATHETIC TO THE STRUGGLES OF THE BIOMASS THE D. THERMAL INDUSTRY WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE THEY PROVIDE TO THOSE OUT COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY RESIDE WITHIN HOWEVER THE OUR PIASTS WHICH HAS BEEN A LEASE COST BEST THAT MECHANISM SINCE IT'S BEEN. BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO IS THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE WHILE ALSO KEEPING A CHECK ON REPAIR COSTS. AND FOR THOSE PURPOSES WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. WHICH CHAIR MEMBERS GREG COOK WAS IN THE EARLY CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY WE HAVE A COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL IN ITS PRESENT FORM NUMBER ONE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE BLANKS FILLED IN. WE THINK IT'S REALLY CLICK CRITICAL THAT THE COMMITTEE A COMPLETE THIS BILL BEFORE IT LEAVES TODAY. NUMBER TWO THE COST OUR RATEPAYERS. BOTH THE SOLAR IN THE WIND INDUSTRY HAVE GOTTEN AND IF WE USE SOME TREMENDOUSLY IN OUR BUSINESS. HAVE GOTTEN SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIES FROM BOTH THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT OVER THE YEARS. WE BELIEVE IN WHAT EXACTLY WHAT BUT THE WHAT THIS BILL IS PROPOSING TO DO BUT THE IMPACT ON OUR RATE PAYERS WOULD BE HORRIFIC. NOT JUST THE COST OF THE GENERATION BUT THE TRANSMISSION COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST OF THIS BILL TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AND WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. YOU CHAIR MEMBERS TRANSMIT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITY ASSOCIATION AND ARE THIRTY NINE OF OUR FORTY MEMBERS OUR POSITION DOES NOT REFLECT THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT. BUT WE OPPOSE BASED ON THE REASONS YOU PREVIOUSLY HEARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JASON ANCHORED WITH ADULTS TING GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH. ON BEHALF OF CAL CCA THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION. BRIEFLY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AMONG THEM. GRANDFATHERING OUT AND EXISTING CONTRACTS FROM JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. DOES PUT A NEW CCA'S AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE. COMPARED TO THE INCUMBENT UTILITIES ARE ALSO THE EXTENT THAT THE THE BILL WOULD INADVERTENTLY RESULT IN EXCESS PROCUREMENT BY THE I. O. U.'S. THAT WILL RESULT IN COST FOR ALL RATEPAYERS INCLUDING CCA RATEPAYERS FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL HOWEVER DO WANNA QUICKLY NO. OUR PRE SHAKES INTO THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR EARLY OUT REACHED US THANK YOU. THANK YOU CATHERINE BRANDENBURG REPRESENTING CINEMA CLEAN POWER ROSS WE SEE CA. AND OUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AND. WITH THE BILL ONE OF THE MAIN WEEK CONCERN IS THE PURCHASE HAVING TO PURCHASE THE SALTON SEA A GEOTHERMAL WE ALREADY PURCHASED FIFTY WE HAVE FIFTY MEGAWATTS AND THE GUYS USED. IN THE CINEMA AREA AND BY MANDATING THAT WE PURCHASE ADDITIONAL THAT IS GOING TO HURT THE RATE PAYERS ON MEMBER WE WORKING. M. AND PURCHASED FROM THE COMMUNITY AND FOR THE COMMUNITY SELL PURCHASING OUTSIDE WOULD BE VERY DETRIMENTAL THANK YOU. THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DUNCAN MCFETRIDGE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. PRINCIPALLY WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CIRCUMVENTION OF THE IRP PROCESS. AND CIRCUMVENTING THAT THAT THAT THAT THE COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESS THANK YOU. CURRENT SLOW PREFERS EMPEROR ENERGY IN SENATOR CASF ELECTRICO WE ARE ALSO IN. PROPOSED WE HAVE. WE THINK WE'RE WELL POSITIONED TO MAKE ART RPO SCHOOLS THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY. AND WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE RP PROCESS THINK. GOOD EVENING CAO JOHNSON CIRCLE CALIFORNIA WE ARE POSED THE BIOMASS REGIONS THE POTENTIAL AIR QUALITY IMPACTS PARTICULARLY IN NON ATTAINMENT AREAS OR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT SURE HERNANDEZ WE HAVE TURNED IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ANOTHER GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON ALSO IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SAYING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AS VARIOUS THEM AS EGGMAN. I HAD I SHARED A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORS. BUT ONE OF THOSE HAVE HAS TO DO WITH ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY STANDARDS BEING BUILT INTO THE PLAN. AYE KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING INTO REMOVE. ANOTHER CONCERN IS WHERE THE FACILITIES WILL BE LOCATED IN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE. TRUCKS. COMING IN TO WIN THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE THE DIRTY AIR BEING CAUSED BY THE DIESEL TRUCKS. SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS A WHAT ARE AS WELL. ALSO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BURN DAYS. CLOTHING SOME LANGUAGE ABOUT. LIMITING THE BURN DAYS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE FACILITIES. AND IN GENERAL ON BIOMASS. IS THIS REALLY. A SOURCE OF ENERGY WE WANT TO INVEST IN. CAN WE LIVE WITH IT ARE THE CLEANER SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT WE CAN INVEST IN. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS. BUT I I FEEL THAT I FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS THAT. THE THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE. AND THE. TO STAKEHOLDERS ESPECIALLY THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS WILL BE. INCLUDED IN THE CONVERSATIONS SO THAT WE DON'T CAUSE MORE HARM. AS WE'RE TRYING TO. ALLEVIATE PROBLEMS THROUGH YOUR BILL. I AM PREPARED TO TO. AND VOTE. IN FAVOR TO ALLOW IT TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE. BUT RESERVE MY. RIGHT TO CHANGE THAT VOTE WHEN IT COMES ON THE FLOOR. DEPENDING ON THE END RESULT AND THE. POTENTIAL HARM AND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN THE GOOD AND THE BAD BECAUSE TO THE COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE. CONSIDER. SO AUTUMN AND I APPRECIATE BECAUSE IT HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS ARE BROUGHT TO LIGHT A COUPLE THINGS THAT. WANTED TO SHARE SO LET'S REMEMBER THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR. CLEAN WATER A BETTER CLIMATE FOR ALL CAME. YOUR TRUCK A CONVERSATION I UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE PUT WE NEED A BIOMASS PLANTS WHERE THEY MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM IN AN AREA THAT THEY DO HAVE TO TRUCK IT IN AND OUT. BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE SO THE INTENT THE INTENT IS THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE EXISTING BIOMASS OF FACILITIES UPGRADED. MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THOSE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SENSE THAT EVER HAPPENED. SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO THIS THE OTHER ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW IF WITH THIS BILL DOESN'T GO FORWARD I CAN'T REDUCE BURN DAYS. WE STILL HAVE ALL THAT WASTE PARTICULARLY AG WASTE AND I SOME OF YOU'VE BEEN TO MY. DISTRICT BEFORE BUT IF SOMEONE IS SAY TO ME YOU NEED TO BURN THOSE STUMPS BECAUSE THE OTHER STARTING TO ROT BECAUSE METHANE OTHER THINGS I. I WOULD SAYIS THAT. YOU GIVE ME A WINDOW TIME WITH THEY ARE BE FOR TWO HOURS IS A BURN DAY YOU GET A PHONE CALL IT'S A BURN DAY YOU RUN OUT YOU START OF. A. STUMP ON FIRE THEY DON'T BURN. LIKE THAT QUICK THEY SMOLDER IN SMOKERS IN THE AIR FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND IT'S THE SAME WITH OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY OTHERS ABOUT ONE THAT WAY STE. FROM THE HALLS WHEN THEY IN PROCESSING THIS IS HARD HOLES AFTER PROCESS OF WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE SAG WASTE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO AND WE NEED TO AT LEAST LOOK AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH RATHER THAN JUST BEING JUST IT'S ALL ABOUT KOSTER. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IS IT GOING TO COST A LOT MORE ABSOLUTELY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS TO BRING THAT COST DOWN FOR THE REPAIRS AS WELL AS THE TAXPAYERS. SO YES AND I COMMITTED TO LIKE INCENTIVIZE THEM OPENING STATEMENT I'M NOT GOING TO BRING THIS THIS TO THE FLOOR. UNLESS I KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHERS WERE GONNA COME UP ON THAT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WE DID OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE WAS GOOD CLEAN AIR FOR ALL. THANK YOU. THE SEGMENT. SO. HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE TO THE COST ISSUE FOR RATEPAYERS? I'M I'M A DIVERSE. ADORES DIVERSE PORTFOLIO. MAKES JUST MORE SENSE. ITS GONNA BE CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN. I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IF WE DON'T DO THIS WITH CALIFORNIA. THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BUYING ENERGY ELSEWHERE. AND WE HAVE GOOD STRINGENT LAWS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE THOSE THE WHAT WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE WITH BIOMASS. DOESN'T NEED TO BE IMPROVED ABSOLUTELY. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE RULES MORE STRINGENT AND THAT'S WHAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. I THINK WE NEED TO REMEMBER. IT'S CHEAPER TO MAINTAIN. AND I HAVE A BALLOTS. WE KNOW THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE FIRES TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE IF WE CAN'T REMEMBER THAT'S PART OF THIS THIS. HOLD A. FORMULA IF WE'RE GONNA SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY WE COULD HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING IN BENEFIT. A ARE WE LOOKING AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES ABSOLUTELY CAN WE TAKE SOME OF THOSE BY THOSE TREES THAT ARE FALLING DOWN ALL OVER THE PLACE MAYBE NEW WOOD PRODUCTS. SO THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO THINK REALLY HOLISTICALLY. AND. I'M HOPING THAT YOU WILL ALL AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE I JUST THINK THAT. IT'S IT'S GONNA COST HUNDRED INITIALLY. BUT IT DID FOR EVERY OTHER EVERY OTHER THE. UTILITY WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST OR BUTTRESSING SO. YES I I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD. THE I'M A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AND. AND I AND I BELIEVE IN I HAVE BELIEVED FOR A LONG TIME I'VE HAD BIOMASS PLANTS GO OUT OF. OUT OF BUSINESS IN MY IN MY DISTRICT THE WITH THE LOSS OF JOBS AND THEN MORE OPEN BURNS ON AG LANDS. TYPE I A BUT TO THE TO THE FORCE AND I CERTAINLY HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TAKING OUT DEAD TREES. THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH I DID A BILL LAST WEEK ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE. AND. USING CAN'T TELEPHONE CONSERVATION CORPS MAKE MAKE THEM THE WHOLE NEW AREA TO WORK ON HIS TO DEVELOPING SOMETHING WITH TIMBER PRODUCTS. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE AND WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT. THE COST I THINK JUST OF THE PROCUREMENT OF THAT ENERGY WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH DOING NOTHING AND DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND ALSO WHEN WE SET POLICY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE FIND WAYS TO REDUCE COST WE FIND WAYS TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT DOWN UNBALANCE THE GRID. I TRUST WE CAN DO THAT WITH THIS I THINK THIS IS A STEP FORWARD. PROM AND I I THINK I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE. NOT LESS A MOVE THE BILL. THINKING. MS LEE MOANED AND MR ACOSTA. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR RAISING THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ACTUALLY FOR SOME TIME. AND. THIS IS ACTUALLY AN IN BIOMASS IS AN ISSUE THAT THE THING COMPLICATED IT'S NOT THE DIRECTION. THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE ENERGY GO AND. AND THEN A FACE THE FACT THAT THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT HAS BEEN DEALT. A VERY DIFFICULT CARD NUMBER I BEING THE SITE OF THE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST WILDFIRE. AND. I HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THIS YOU'VE ADDRESSED I THINK SOME OF THE. THAT CONCERNS RELATED TO TYING. THE BILL. TWO CLEANER AND BETTER TECHNOLOGY HATE WHICH I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE KNOW THAT SOME FACILITIES. ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS ARE DIRTIER THAN OTHERS AND I THINK THAT. WE'VE SEEN THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PARTICULARLY WORRIED. AS SOME OF THOSE HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF OUR MOST UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. I THINK THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS. THAT I I'D LOVE TO HAVE A RESPONSE ONE WHO. FROM ABOUT ONE IS RELATED TO THIS CCA'S THERE'S BEEN SOME COMMENTS MADE THAT THIS. WOULD NOT I SUPPORT SOME OF THE WORK THAT CCA'S ARE DOING AND THE OTHER ONE IS TO WHAT AND. IS BEING KIND OF REFER TO AS THE S. EXCLUSIVITY OF GEOTHERMAL WHAT THE SALTON SEA AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN. COMMENT ON. THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THOSE. SO SALTY REGION AS YOU'VE ALL HEARD. ME IN MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE. CENTER WESSEL TALK ABOUT QUITE CONSTANTLY. IS A. BOTHA AN ENVIRONMENTAL. CATASTROPHE IN THE PROCESS OF HAPPENING. AND AT THE SAME TIME A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. ABOUT WITH THE CLOSER TO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO HELP MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. TOUGH FOR THE STATE. WE HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE AS I ALLUDED TO EARLIER. WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT THE HIGHEST? LEVEL. IN THE STATE PAYING CLOSE TO COLUSA COUNTY. ONE OR TWO PERCENT GIVE OR TAKE. AND WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BOTH ADDRESS AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS HERE. AND MEET CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GOALS. AND ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN. A SYSTEMIC. BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE IN THIS PART OF THE STATE. THE EXCLUSIVITY. THAT IS REFERRED TO. IS THE THE FACT THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT A PERCENTAGE OF GEOTHERMAL. ENERGY SHOULD COME FROM THAT REGION. IS TO ADDRESS. THE POINTS THAT I'VE JUST MADE. THIS IS AN AREA THAT NEEDS THIS TYPE OF INVESTMENT. TO TURN AROUND BOTH THE. ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXIST AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES TODAY. HA IF. WERE ALLOWED TO. THE SALTON SEA REGION. CAN DEPLOY. CLOSED ABOUT A THOUSAND. MEGA WATTS. OF JAIL DOOR MORE ENERGY. WE HAVE THE TRANSMISSION THAT EXIST AND THAT'S. ACCORDING TO THE CALLASPO. STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REGIONAL PARTNERS OUT THERE. AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE. I AM. YES IS IT IS AN EXCLUSIVITY IN BUT THERE'S ALSO IT EXTRA ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THERE. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AS I MENTIONED BOTH ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUES. AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES. IN THE REGION. CALIFORNIA. ALL OF YOU. HAVE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION. THAT ENSURES THAT THE. STATE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH A SOLVENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN. TO ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS OF. S. C. DRYING UP IN. EXACERBATING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE I YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE SEVEN OUT OF TEN CHILDREN OUT THERE SUFFER FROM RESPIRATORY. DISEASE PROBLEMS. I DON'T HAVE TO REITERATE IT BUT. YOU KNOW COUNTY THAT'S GOT TWENTY SIX PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT. IN A WE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF WHEN WE WAVE THE FLAG THAT CALIFORNIA TODAY. IS THAT I GOT THE LOWEST. UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS FOUR PERCENT THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN. IN THE STATE. BUT THERE PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT THAT PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS. SO I AM. I LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT. CALIFORNIA. HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS PART OF THE STATE. IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN. MY OPENING STATEMENTS AND IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTIONS. AND WE ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GOALS. AND THEY'RE SITTING RIGHT THERE. AT THE SOLVENCY. REGARD THE CCA'S I THINK. YOU KNOW PROBABLY WITH SOME OF CAME TOGETHER THEY WERE NOT THINKING OF SOME OF THIS OTHER ENERGY AND RESOURCES. THIS THE TIME WE WENT THROUGH THE TABLE SO WE CAN HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS SO I'M NOT PUTTING ANYONE OUT THAT IS WHY WE ARE TRYING TO TAKE A REALLY GOOD. STRONG STRATEGY DOING THIS THIS IS THE TIME WE CAN DO IT RIGHT. IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND I REALLY THINK THAT. WE ALL NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE AND THEM. YOU KNOW I JUST I I WANNA MAKE A REAL QUICK COMMENT I'M WHICH I THOUGHT WAS. GREAT THE I'M OF THE AT ONE THE OPPOSITION WAS SMUG. AND. THERE'S THE ASSEMBLY THAT'S A REALLY GOOD ACTOR. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THE REALLY GOOD JOB. SMUD WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE A THING TO COMPLY WITH THIS BILL. THAT'S GREAT. THIS BILL IS ENCOURAGING OTHER ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS TO PROCURE ENERGY IN THE SAME. IN THE BALANCE WEIGHT THE* ALREADY DOES. SO I WANT OUR FOLKS AT THE TABLE I WANT ALL OF US TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND. FOR THE EARTH TO MAKE IT INTO TO BE AT THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE A GOOD OF A RELIABLE. A WAY TO A DEAL WITH ENERGY GOING FORWARD. AND FINAL QUESTIONS IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE SOME BLANKS IN THIS BILL WHO CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING HOW THOSE BLANKS ARE GOING TO BE FILLED OUT AND WHEN. COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEARN WHAT THOSE BLANKS. WILL BE. THE. FIRST ITERATION OF THE LEGISLATION HAD. SOME NUMBERS THERE AND IT WAS BOMB. THE PRIOR COMMITTEE THAT DECIDED TO KEEP THOSE. BLANK IN THE INTERESTS OF BEGINNING TO EXPAND. THE CONVERSATION TO BECOME A BIT MORE. COMPREHENSIVE. THE ISSUE OF THE. RP S. POTENTIALLY INCREASING. THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE I RP. THE ISSUE OF REGIONALIZATION TAKING PLACE. TOOK PLACE LAST YEAR LIKE IT. IT CONVERSATION THAT COMES UP AGAIN. AND SO THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. BRING A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THE TABLE. AND TRY TO GET THIS RIGHT. AND SO. ALTHOUGH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT I REPRESENT IN PURE COUNTY. DID NOT FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE. PICKING OUT THOSE PERCENTAGES. THE IDEA OF BEING INTENTIONAL RIGHT TO PROCURE GEOTHERMAL IN OUR REGION IS IS HAS BEEN. PART OF MY GOAL PART OF THE REGION'S GOAL AND SO BY TAKING THOSE PERCENTAGES OUT. IT REALLY LEAVES US AGAIN. IN A POSITION WHERE WE ARE HOPEFUL. RIGHT THAT THE MARKET WILL CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE GUILD THERMAL RENEWABLE TREE BANK SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO THE. PROCUREMENT PROCESS AND MAYBE. AND MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP SOME OF THIS OUT THE SONG SEE. THAT WILL HELP AGAIN ARE. ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES RELATED TO A DYING SEE. SO WHAT WERE. I WRITE MORE EAGER MAYBE THAN. MANY OF YOU HAVE THESE CONCERNS WANT TO SEE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT PERCENTAGES GET BACK ON THE TABLE AND REALLY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. VIA THE CONTINUED DIALOGUE. OF THIS BILL IF IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU AT LIKE I MENTIONED I A DEATHLY HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. AND. I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THERE'SAN INTEREST TO GET ALL THESE CONCERNS. AT YOU KNOW AT LEAST DISCUSSED THAT ENOUGH THERE WILL BE FULLY ADDRESS. I'M AYE A WILL THAT SUPPORTED TODAY BECAUSE I ALSO KNOW THAT I'M IN A DISTRICT WITH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES. OF BIOMASS SITTING THERE NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS. UP BUT I I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AND IF THE BILL IN CONVERSATION DOESN'T MOVE IN A DIRECTION THAT I THINK IS CONSISTENT WITH. THE BALANCING AN INTERSECTION OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN TERMS OF ENERGY. A WHAT WE WANT TO DELIVER TO CONSTITUENTS. A AND. YOU KNOW JUST AIR QUALITY OVER ALL AND. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL BE THERE ARE NOT I'M ONCE IT COMES ON THE FLOOR BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS IS. IT'S A HARD CONVERSATION BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT. WHAT WE NEED TO BE FORCED TO HAVE IT? THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MISTER POSTED THEN MISTER STONE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AND I I THINK YOU BOTH FOR TACKLING SUCH A THORNY ISSUE HERE THIS IS A CHALLENGING. IF YOU TO BE ABLE TO TO ADDRESS AND I TELL YOU I. JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THE GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS YOU KNOW IT'S AN AREA I HAVE GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT THE BAD NEWS THE THING I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE SPILLS WHAT'S GOOD. BEEN LAID OUT. I'M NOT TOTALLY COMFORTABLE. WITH. THE SALT SEA ISSUE ALL RESPECT I I'VE BEEN DOWN THEM MANY TIMES OVER THE YEARS. AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IN YOUR DISTRICT AND I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE. AS A SOCIETY FRANKLY BUT. OUR THE EXCLUSIVITY SAUCY HAS ME TROUBLE. THE. PERCENTAGE BEING BEING GONE HAS ME TROUBLE NOT BEING THERE AND I KNOW THAT WASN'T YOUR CHOICE. YOU THE AUTHOR'S CHOICE. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE. AND OF COURSE RATE PAYER ISSUES IN AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS BUT I THINK WHEN YOU BALANCE IT. WITH THE FACT THAT ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN ON. TIMBER TOURS OR BEEN. THAT YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE AG SECTOR IT IS YOU WORK IN THE AG SECTOR AND HAVING BEEN DOWN TALK TO PEOPLE ON ACT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THERE AND I I SAW WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WILD FIRES WE ALL SAW THE THE. ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION THE LOSS OF LIFE THE COST OF THE SURE IT'S COST. ON AND ON AND ON I WON'T BELABOR THAT BUT WE HAD SIGNIFICANT FIRES IN MY DISTRICT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS BILL WOULD WOULD REALLY HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE THERE ARE MOSTLY YOU KNOW THE BRUSH TYPE BUYERS WILL HAVE THE. SOME OF THOSE SELF SAME ISSUES BUT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE I THINK TO TAKE SOME OF THIS MATERIAL OUT. DO THE RIGHT THING WITH IT PRODUCE SOMETHING IN OUR BASELOAD ENERGY IN OUR BASE LOW THAT WE REALLY DESPERATELY NEED. AND AND SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING. YOU KNOW THE COST OF BIOMASS ETCETERA. LOOK I I AGREE. I THINK THE FREE MARKET SHOULD DECIDE ALL OF THE STUFF YOU KNOW BIG SURPRISE I KNOW YOU'RE ALL SHOCK WERE WAY THAT SHIP SAILED. AND WE SORT WEEKS WE. SUBS. SET UPON THEY MISSED THE DIVESTMENT PUN OKAY. WHAT THAT THAT SHIP SAILED AND AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IS THAT WE DO SUBSIDIZE LOTS OF THINGS INCLUDING SOLAR AND WIND ENERGY? AND THEY DON'T WORK ALL THE TIME AND WE ARE AS IS OUR STATE GROSS FROM THIRTY EIGHT MILLION TO FIFTY MILLION AS IS PROJECTED TO DO WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES WE POSSIBLY CAN BRING TO BEAR. AND I THINK THE BASELOAD ANSWER HERE THAT THAT THAT IS PROVIDING TO OUR BASELOAD IS IS VERY IMPORTANT AT THOSE TIMES ONLY. I DON'T HAVE THAT THE ENERGY THAT WE NECESSARILY NEED. I THINK IT'S A PART OF US THAT THE SOLUTION IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS A LOT OF WORK FREE TO BE DONE DOWN ON THIS. I'M NOT TOTALLY THERE YET BUT LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION PARTICULARLY SINCE THIS IS THE ONLY BILL. ADDRESSING ALL OF THIS MATERIAL THIS YEAR SO LET'S CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I'LL SUPPORT IT RELUCTANTLY TODAY. BUT I ALSO WANT TO. IT AS ALWAYS I THINK KIND OF REDUNDANT TO SAY THAT WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE OUR OUR OUR VOTE ON THE FLOOR BUT. I WOULD REALLY LIKE THAT THOUGH THAT CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE ON THIS PARTICULARLY WITH YOU KNOW WITH UTILITY SECTOR WITH CONSUMER GROUPS AND CONSUMER ADVOCATES. AND OF COURSE THIS MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CLEANEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION IN THIS ROUND BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE MATERIAL SOMEHOW SO. THANK FOR BRING US FOR AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU. CHAU. THANK YOU. WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS CONVERSATION. EVERY YEAR FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS AND. WERE. WE'RE NO FURTHER WITH IT WHICH IS FRUSTRATING DO I THINK FRUSTRATING TO ALL OF US LEGISLATURE CONSISTENTLY. HAS TURNED DOWN THESE MANDATED CONTRACTS APPROACHES. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE EVEN IF THIS BILL MOVES. SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS EVEN WITHOUT NECESSARILY A BELL SO YOU KNOW THIS CAN FACILITATE THAT OR NOT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A BIGGER PICTURE. AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS CAUTIOUS. AND. IT I I HAVE BEEN DOWN SOLD CA COMPLETELY AGREE WITH AND I'VE TRIED TO HELP SENATOR HUESO EVEN BACK WHEN HE WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ON THIS ISSUE WITH WITH THE SOLVENCY AND THEY'RE REALLY TWO ISSUES GOING ON HERE. THE BIOMASS ISSUE AND THEN THE SALTON SEA. AND EVEN THEN GEOTHERMAL ON TOP OF THAT THEY THEY ARE DISTINCT ISSUES. AND EACH OF THEM ONE THINGS THAT THAT. THAT DOES DISTRESSED ME A LITTLE BIT IS THIS IS A WAY OUT OF. TRANSMISSION THIS IS A WAY NOT OUT OF TRANSMISSION. WE'RE STILL EVEN IF WE DO THAT PUT THESE IN PLACE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TRANSITION IN TRANSMISSION LINES WITH. AND MAYBE LESS OUT OF STATE BUT THAT WE HAVE THE REGIONALIZATION CONVERSATION WHICH IS THEN MOVING. TRANSMISSION LINES OUT OF STATE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BLEND IT ALL TOGETHER SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE TRYING TO FRAME THIS WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE IN THE BENEFITS ARE. FINDING A WAY TO. PUT MONEY INTO THE SOLVENCY AREA I'M WITH. AND IF THAT'S ULTIMATELY COST SHIFTING THROUGH THE RATES THAT GIVES ME SOME SOME HEARTBURN MAYBE THERE ARE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD WAYS ULTIMATELY DOING THAT BECAUSE IF WE MANDATE CONTRACTS WHICH HAS SPENT SOME IN THIS LEGISLATURE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN HAS SAID NO TO. THEN WE ARE IN FACT PUTTING BURDENS ON SOME OF THESE NAY SAID CCA'S THAT ARE DEVELOPING. AND MAKING THEM LESS COMPETITIVE THAN THE THE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT'S IT THAT'S A CONCERN AND FINING SUBSIDIES WE SUBSIDIZE SOLAR YES AND WHEN THAN WE HAVE DONE ALL THAT. BUT NOT THROUGH THESE MANDATED CONTRACTS. WHICH WHICH CAN HAVE LONGER TERM IMPLICATIONS IN FOR US TO SUBSIDIZE A PARTICULAR IDEA OR TECHNOLOGY OR CONCEPT HAS BEEN INTERESTING TO LEGISLATURE FOR A LONG TIME. THAT HAS DRIVEN MARKETS WE HAVE BECAUSE OF THAT THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAS HAD SOME VERY POSITIVE EFFECTS. BUT AGAIN MANDATING THIS A CONTRACTS IS IS WHAT. I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO IF THIS IS THE ONLY MECHANISM TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. AND IT'S PROVEN BY HISTORY NOT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. I I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT WHERE THAT LEAVES US. AND THEN EVEN ON THAT THE BIO. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT BURNING THINGS AS THE ANSWER EVEN THOUGH IT IS BETTER THAN THE OPEN BURNING IN THAT THERE ARE WAYS ABSOLUTELY TO MANAGE IT. BUT WE'RE NOT CAREFUL CAN BE PUTTING THOSE FACILITIES. LOCATED IN EXACTLY THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO PROTECT. AND THAT'S NOT WORKING AND BECAUSE THE SCOPE OF ALL OF THE DEAD TREES AND ALL THAT THE AREAS ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA WHERE WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT WOULD. THAT MEANS HAVING MANY MANY BIOMASS FACILITIES CITED. BUT ALSO MEANS TRANSMISSION LINES OR WERE TRACKING THAT MATERIAL IN. AND ITEM THAT WE'VE ACCOUNTED FOR ALL. IN IN THE QUESTION OR IN THE CONVERSATIONAL TIMIDLY THAT WERE HAVING BECAUSE IT'S AN IN ALL THIS AGAIN THIS IS KIND OF I THINK YOUR POINT IS ITS ABOUT TRADEOFFS. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT. WHAT I CONTINUE A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF A BY A MASS IN THE BURNING AT THAT LEVEL BUT I AM INTERESTED IN THEIR COUNTRIES THAT HAVE? SINCE GETTING EVEN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THIRTY PLUS PERCENT OF THEIR ELECTRICITY THAT IS PROVIDED BY MAP BY BIOMASS AND THEY IMPORT BIOMASS IN ORDER TO DRIVE THAT ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THOSE ARE SOME VERY. ECOLOGICALLY CLEAN COUNTRIES WITH WITH GOOD GOOD AIR QUALITY SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME SOME MODELS OUT THERE. BUT IF IT'S ABOUT RESTORING THE FACILITIES THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN OR ADDING NEW FACILITIES WE'RE NOW ADDING A LOT OF COMPLEXITY WE'RE ADDING NEW AIR QUALITY QUESTIONS TO IT. AND READING TRANSMISSION LINES NOW. ALL OVER THE PLACE IF IN IF WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT THAT THROUGH I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE GO WITH THIS. SO LAST YEAR THERE WAS A BILL THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. PUSH A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THEM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THAT THE CHAIR IS GOING TO DO. PROBABLY INCLINED TO TO FOLLOW THE CHAIR AND HELP OUT BECAUSE THIS IS THE THIS IS THE COMMITTEE THAT'S BEEN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION BUT ALL THE SUPPORTERS OUT THERE WHO WANT THIS. TO TO PASS THROUGH. THIS HASN'T BEEN THE ANSWER. THIS PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE THE ANSWER THIS YEAR BECAUSE IT'S A MY GUESS IS GONNA DIE AGAIN LIKE IT'S DIED BEFORE EVERY SINGLE TIME SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US. WHY AREN'T WE WHAT'S THE REAL ANSWER? HOW DO WE PROVE AND AND THERE ARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE LOOKING AT THIS THE PC AND OTHERS TO TRY AND AND PEACE ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND THEN THIS YEAR ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS? WE'RE GONNA SEE SOME THAT THE UTILITIES ARE LOOKING FOR. A CHANGE IN HOW LIABILITIES CALCULATED. AND IF THAT WORKS. THEN GUESS WHO'S GOING TO BE PICKING UP THAT LIABILITY WHICH MEANS THERE NOW IT'S THE RATE PAYERS IT'S THE HOMEOWNERS. THEY'RE NOW PAYING A WHOLE LOT MORE SO WE'RE. WHICH WOULD ADDING BURDEN ON TOP OF BURDEN IN. IN A WAY IN SITUATION NOW BECAUSE OF THE FIRES OF HIS SITUATION WE. THAT IT'S REALLY UNCERTAIN. SO I. I FEEL YOUR PAIN I UNDERSTAND WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THERE'S A LOT OF IT THAT I LIKE THAT HAVE REALLY PUSHED AND STRETCH. TO TRY AND HELP BEFORE BUT IT JUST SEEMS AND THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. THIS JUST YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR WE'RE JUST IN THE SAME PLACE. AND SPINNING OUR WHEELS SO I HOPE WE GET A LITTLE MORE CREATIVE FIND SOME SOME WAY ELSE. TO TRULY INCENTIVIZE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE IF THERE. IF IT'S WORTH IT A LITTLE BIT A SUBSIDY MIGHT END UP CREATING A MARKET. BUT LONG TERM CONTRACTS IF THE IF WE END UP SUPPORTING THEM AND NOT DRIVING TECHNOLOGY AND NOT CREATING THAT MARKET NOT CREATING THAT INNOVATION THAT THEN ULTIMATELY DRIVES COSTS DOWN. AND WE JUST END UP IN A POSITION OF OF. OF SUBSIDIZING THROUGH THE RATES. TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING ANYWHERE ANYWAY THAT I DON'T THINK WE'VE DONE OURSELVES A GREAT SERVICE. SO THAT'S. RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT LEAVES US RIGHT I THINK I THINK IT NEEDS IS A PLACE WHERE I THINK YOU NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION. I CAN APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM EVERYONE. THUS FAR BUT YOURS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY. HELPFUL RIGHT IN HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. AND VOTING NO. RIGHT IS REALLY NOT THAT GOING TO GET US ANYWHERE DIFFERENT THAN AS YOU JUST SAID. THEY WERE WE'VE BEEN BEFORE. AND SO THE FACT IS I THINK COMMITTEES ALL THE TIME AND PEOPLE SAY I WOULD VOTE NO ON YOUR BILL BUT I WANT TO BE IN YOUR IN THE CONVERSATION. WHAT LIGHT AND THAT AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO WRITE NAY WE I THINK THAT YOU BRING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OF VALUE TO THE DISCUSSION? FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS HOLISTICALLY ARE. THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISE AS IT RELATES TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. AS THEY'VE BEEN RAISED UP BY SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HERE INCLUDING FOLKS IN OUR DISTRICT. DOT IDEA AND I KNOW HOW CONCERNED YOU ARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AT IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND THAT BRINGS. THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE BRINGS A LOT OF CREDIBILITY TO THIS TO AUTHORIZATION AND SO. WERE ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES. WE HAVEN'T PICKED A WHOLE LOT OF EASY ISSUES OF THE THREE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE TO WORK ON. AND DON'T INTEND TO CHANGE THAT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THESE ARE PRESSING MATTERS IN MY DISTRICT. AND THEY TIE INTO THE OVERALL STATE. CONVERSATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE AND SO. AYE MULLIN. WHEN IT COMES TO ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES. A. DEALING WITH THESE HARD ISSUES AND IF WE CAN'T GET TO A PLACE WHERE FOLKS FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE SAID THAT I WILL RESERVE MY RIGHT. TO VOTE ON THE BILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR IF IT COMES TO THE FLOOR. AND IT. DOESN'T DIE. YOU KNOW THE QUESTION ABOUT THE EXCLUSIVITY TO THE SALTON SEA HAS COME UP. YOU TELL ME ANOTHER PLACE ON THIS CONTINENT. THAT HAS THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES. LIKE THE SONGS THE AREA DOES AS A RELEASE A GEOTHERMAL. THERE ISN'T. AND SO THAT'S WHY THERE IS. OF THE INTENTION HERE. TO ENSURE THAT WE PROCURE SOME ENERGY FROM THAT REGION TO HELP US ADDRESS BOTH THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THAT. THIS PART OF THE STATE SO. I'D MISTER STONE AYE I WELCOME YOUR PARTICIPATION. DIRECTLY AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MY COLLEAGUE THAT AS WELL. I THINK WE CAN GET THINGS DONE YEAH I AND. NOT JUST YOU BUT TO THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL. IF THIS THING MOVES DIE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. WE'RE GOING TO BACK HAVE THE SAME CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR BECAUSE WE HAD AT LAST YEAR WE HAD A YEAR BEFORE WE'VE HAD IT EVERY NUMBER OF YEARS. SO NOTHING'S MOVING. IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO MOVE SOMETHING. WE NEED SOMETHIN DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT'S YOU WE CAN'T KEEP TRYING THE SAME THING TO GET THROUGH AND IT AND IT NOT WORK. IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS IN THE SALTON SEA WHICH I BELIEVE AND. PROBLEMS WHICH PROBABLY MULTI FACETED TO ADDRESSTHE LARGEST AG WASTES BUT THE FORCE FIRE ISSUES AND THAT. AND. THE WAY THE FORCE OF GROWN IN AND OUT OF THAT WE NEED TO BE CLEARED OUT BECAUSE I'M NOT. COMMENCING SO MANY COMMENCEMENT OTHERWISE BUT WE JUST PUT SOME BIOMASS PLANTS AROUND. THAT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT'S A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN ABOUT. WITHOUT NECESSARILY SOMETHING IN MIND AND IF WE AND IF WE. PAST THE HOUR THE RATEPAYERS TO NOW PUT MONEY IN THROUGH THESE LONG TERM CONTRACTS. TO A SYSTEM OF. BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT ULTIMATELY DON'T. HELP US SOLVE THE PROBLEM OR OR ART LONG TERM SUCCESSFUL. THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER THAT THAT AT SOME POINT IT SO THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE WAY MAYBE WE NEED OTHER INVESTMENTS ME WE NEED TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY TO TO SPUR THAT TECHNOLOGY. AND SEE AND SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND ANSWERING THEIR QUALITY ISSUES ALONG THE WAY. SO THAT'S. AND. SO WHAT WAS IS A TOUGH ISSUE IT IS A TOUGH ISSUE AND. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. YOU KNOW IT'S OUR JOB IS LEGISLATORS TO MOVE THESE KIND OF THINGS THROUGH AND AND THERE'S THESE ARE TOUGH POLICIES WE GOTTA FIGURE IT'S GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME I'M DOES NO DOUBT ABOUT IT I WANT YOU AT THE TABLE. AND I THINK I AGREE WITH. AND SOME REMEMBER GARCIA. IT'S OUR JOB TO ME YEAH HIS LEGS SO TO SAY HOW THE STATE SHOULD BE MORE SUSTAINABLE MANAGER FOR US. ITS SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT'S PART OF THIS FOR. AND SO. I GROUP I DON'T OF THOSE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BUT. I HOPE THAT YOU THAT ALL OF US STAND TOGETHER. MAKE A CHANGE. AND IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND THERE'S THE REASONS OF NOT NUMBERS IN THINGS SOMETIMES BECAUSE WE PUT IT YOU GUYS BILL ABOUT THE NUMBERS NOT LOOKING A HOLISTIC APPROACH. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING. MOST SINCE BEEN MADE HER SECOND. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. NIZAGARA CURRY MISTER GARCIA. OF. I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE. THAT WE ALL RESPECT HEALTH HARD YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR. CONSTITUENTS IN YOUR DISTRICT. YEAR IN YEAR OUT. I. LIKE TO ECHO MISTER STONE'S COMMENTS ABOUT HOW. THERE IS A FRUSTRATION. AND. SPINNING. FEELING. LIKE WE'RE SPINNING OUR WHEELS. WITHOUT MOVING FORWARD. BUT THAT IS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU TALKED ABOUT. HOW IT'S OUR JOB AND YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB? EXCELLENTLY BOTH OF YOU. I FEEL YOU KNOW AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS A LOT WAS STAFF. YOU NO AND MY DOING MY JOB AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS ON A BILL WITH BLANKS IN. AND. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY NO. FUNDAMENTALLY I AND YOU KNOW. I I TO BELIEVE THAT. THAT THE IRAQI PROCESS. SHOULD. ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND THAT. MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS. THE IMPACT ON THE RATEPAYERS ESPECIALLY. YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID ON THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE ALSO AND. WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION AT THE LAST MEETING. WE'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF BIG ISSUES REALIZATION. CCA'S. A WILDFIRE LIABILITY. AND TO ADD THAT YOU KNOW. YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR DISTRICT BUT OUR JOB IS TO LOOK OUT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW TO RESPECT TO THE AUTHORS I'M GIVING A NON RECOMMENDATION I NEVER TO CONVEY THAT TO THE? TO THE. COMMITTEE SO. EVERYONE'S. TO FOLLOW THEIR CONSCIENCE. BUT I FEEL LIKE I I CANNOT VOTE WITH THAT WITH THE BLANKS IN IT. AND SO I WILL BE OF SPAIN. JUST LIKE YOU'RE UP STATING WHAT THE BLANKS IN THE BILL I GOT IT STAINED. WOULD YOU LIKE CLOSE. IF NOT NOW WHEN. YEAH. IF NOT NOW WHEN I WOULD ASK HIM FOR THEM AND. WERE COMMITTED TO DO IT TICKET CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE BLANKS. AND. I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING WE DON'T HAVE MEN THIS BECAUSE A I WANT THAT THE DISCUSSION TO BE HOLISTIC OTHERWISE WERE JUST CAN WE ARE. OVER A NUMBER. SO WITH THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR. ENTERTAINING. AND THIS PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW I. WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN. FURTHER AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS COME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. IN FACT MAYBE EVEN THE PERCENTAGES AND WE COULD HAVE GONE BACK TO YOU ANY AND. HAD THAT DEBATE DISCUSSION THERE AS WELL AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. SOMETHING THAT STAKEHOLDERS IN. MY DISTRICT. A BIT FRUSTRATED ABOUT. THE OTHER IS PERHAPS YOU KNOW MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB IN ARTICULATING THAT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT OUR DISTRICT. THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO. NEAT. STATES RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. A CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO ENSURE THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. ISN'T ONCE AGAIN LEFT BEHIND. AND CONTINUE WITH THE SAME PRACTICES. THE SAME OUTCOMES. AND ULTIMATELY CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND IT NOT MOVE ANYWHERE. AT SO YOU KNOW I. APPRECIATE THE NON RECOMMENDATION AND HOPEFULLY. THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO. FURTHER EXTEND THIS DISCUSSION. AND. COME BACK THE AT SOME POINT THAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WHETHER BE WITH YOURSELF FOR. YOU ANY IN AND FILL IN THOSE BLANKS. AND ONCE AGAIN HAVE THIS DEBATE IS TO SEE IF AND PACKETS OF WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE. OP I KNOW NOW I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF. OUR DISTRICT. AND WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT IT. MEETS MANY OF THE GOALS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS STEPPED FORWARD. THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE STILL. ABSOLUTELY AND I ENCOURAGE YOU AND THE REST OF THE FOLKS WHO RAISE THOSE QUESTIONS TODAY TO. ENGAGE WITH US THEM DIRECTLY RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVALED. A COLLEAGUES. ALRIGHT. MOTIONS BEEN MADE WE DO. IS OUR SECOND. SECOND RATE. BROKE UP WITH. ITEM SIX A. TWENTY TOOL EIGHT BY AGRA CURRY AND EDUARDO GARCIA THE MOTION IS TO PASS ON REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ROUTE TO CHIEF NOT FOR. ROUTE TO GIN UP VOTING ACOSTA. HI ACOSTA AYE CHAU CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA AYE FLORA AYE LIMON. LIMON AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ. THE LENDERS KNOW RAYOS. VARIOUS AYE STONE. STONE NO. EIGHT. SEVEN TWO. BILL IS OUT THEY CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ALRIGHT. MISTER BIGELOW. IF THE CHAIRMAN IF IT WOULD PLEASE THE BODY. HAS A. COMMITMENT I WOULD FEEL TERRIBLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRACIOUS OFFER. WITHOUT ANY OBJECTION IS FRIEDMAN. THINK YOU COULD AFTER THEIR CHAIR MEMBERS. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. THIS BILL WAS AN IDEA THAT I HAD BASED ON. WORK I'VE DONE WHEN I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER WHERE WE WOULD HAVE OF PEOPLE COME TO PROPOSE PROJECTS IN FRONT OF MY CITY COUNCIL. AND THERE'D BE A LOT OF BAD THINGS IN THE SECRET DOCUMENT THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE PROJECT WAS BUILT BUT THE DOCUMENTS WERE BASICALLY SILENT WHEN IT WOULD COME TO BAD THINGS THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DIDN'T BUILD THE PROJECT. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT INSURES THAT THE ECONOMIC LEGAL SOCIAL TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER BENEFITS INCLUDE REGION WIDER STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF A PROPOSED PROJECT. AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF DENYING A PROJECT OR INCORPORATED IN HOW A PROJECT IS DESCRIBED EVALUATED UNDER SEQUEL. THIS WORKS TO A DO THIS WOULD HELP TO EXPLAIN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A PROJECTS DELAY OR PROJECTS NOT PROJECTS OBSTRUCTION. I'M AS THE NEED FOR DENSITY IN URBAN AREAS INCREASES INFILL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ARE OFTEN TARGETED. TO YOU KNOW FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS BUT THIS WOULD HELP EXPLAIN TO DECISION MAKERS WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE OF NOT DOING THAT PROJECT AND SECRET DOCTRINE TO SUPPOSED TO GIVE US THE MOST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. SO THIS WILL I FEEL AS SOMEONE WHO USED TO HAVE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND REALLY THE RAMIFICATIONS OF NOT JUST DOING A PROJECT BUT OF NOT DOING A PROJECT. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO ADDS A METRIC OF BENEFIT IN THE STATE OF OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION TO ME I ARE TOTALLY IT AND SHE NEEDS TO CONSIDER IN THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE PROJECT. AS FAR AS WE KNOW WE'VE GOT NO LETTERS OF OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ROSS FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY MUCH SO WITH WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING YELLING COVERAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN WHERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUT WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LEAD AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS. OF THEIR DENIAL OF A PROJECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SO MANY COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS OUT THERE SEEKING TO PRESERVE THEIR OWN LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVEN. IT'S USUALLY AT THE EXPENSE OF CALIFORNIANS WORKING POOR AT OUR MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES THANK YOU. Q. AND A FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NINE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. UP THE PLACE COME FOR. ANGER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. IF YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SYNC MS MELENDEZ THANK YOU KNOW QUESTION I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT THIS WAS THE NINE RECOMMENDATION FOR OUR CAUCUS ANYWAY. AND WHEN I FIRST READ THROUGH THE BILL IN THE ANALYSIS I SCRATCH MY HEAD A LITTLE BIT SO THAT WHAT IS SHE UP TO. BUT THE REALITY IS NO NO I MEAN BECAUSE WE ARE THAT'S NOT YEAH IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE AN INSULT THAT'S MEANT TO BE THAT WE ARE TYPICALLY ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF ISSUES LIKE THIS I'M. BUT I THINK THAT HAVING ALSO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVEN THOUGH. YOU NO PROPONENTS CAN COME IN ANY CITY COUNCIL MEETING IN SHARE THE BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY I THINK INCORPORATING THEM INTO SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTS ONLY HELPS TO IT KIND OF. FURTHER SOLIDIFY THE ARGUMENT RATE SO I DON'T FIND ANYTHING OBJECTIONABLE ABOUT. MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS BILL I JUST THINK IT MAKES SENSE I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SAYING THAT IS OUR MOTION. MOTION AND SECOND IRATE. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS MS FRIEDMAN WHICH LIKE CLOSE. I REQUEST WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CHOSE RECOMMENDATION IS AN AYE. A ROLL CALL PLEASE.

HOW OUR CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND A ANY POTENTIAL AT SUBSIDIES FOR COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IN THE BUILDING? INDUSTRY MARKETPLACE HOT THE PORTIONS OF THE BILL THAT THAT DEAL WITH MAKING ACCESS TO A DEAD AND DYING TREES AND LADDER FUELS WE FULLY SUPPORT. IT'S WHEN THE BILL GOES THAT ONE STEP FURTHER IN AND POTENTIALLY CREATE SUBSIDIES FOR COMPETING. PRODUCTS THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN IS RAISED. IF IT'S A GOOD IDEA WE THINK THAT THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENT WILL COME TO THE STATE ON ITS OWN. THAT WITH ACCESS TO THAT TO THAT FUEL SO A POTENTIAL FEEL SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE YOU. CHARLIE BREA CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS ASSOCIATION TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR I GOT READY MIX CONCRETE AND DEATH AND. TESTAMENTO PRODUCERS AND. AGAIN WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEED AND BEING ADDRESS THAT HAVE THE SOME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

ITEM FOURTEEN AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE MISTER BLUFF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS STUCK CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAM WHICH IS BETTER KNOWN AS THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM IS A SELF FUNDED PROGRAM THAT ENCOURAGES CONSUMERS TO RECYCLE. BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TO PREVENT LETTERING. OVER THE THREE DECADES OF ITS OPERATION THE BOTTOM BILL PROGRAM IS DIVERTED MANY MANY MILLIONS OF BEVERAGE CONTAINERS FROM LANDFILLS AND FOR MOST OF THIS TIME IT'S BEEN SEEN AS A MODEL RECYCLING PROGRAM. HOWEVER OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT REPUTATION HAS TAKEN A BIT OF A BEATING AGAIN THE. PROGRAM HAS BEEN TRENDING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE TOTAL IN STATE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE SHUDDERED ITS OPERATIONS. USE OF THE VERY PLACES WHERE CONSUMERS RETURNED THEIR CONTAINERS OR SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN THEIR CONTAINERS TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK. THIS MASS INFRASTRUCTURE LOSS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE COMPOUNDING EFFECTS OF PLUMMETING WORLD WILD WORLD WILL HEIGHT COMMODITIES PRICES AND THE REDUCTION IN STATE PAYMENTS TO THE RECYCLERS LOCATED AND ARE CONVENIENCE OUNCE. THE MASSIVE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE LOS BROUGHT TO LIGHT MANY OF THE EXISTING ISSUES WITH THE PROGRAM IN THESE ISSUES INCLUDE FRAUD WITHIN THE PROGRAM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAMS THE PROGRAM'S RIGID STRUCTURE THAT IMPEDED THE STATE'S ABILITY. TO REACT TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS AND THE PROGRAMS ONGOING STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND FINALLY AN OVER RELIANCE ON CONSUMERS FOR FINANCING THE PROGRAM. IDEAS ON HOW TO REFORM THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM HAVE BEEN SUED YET A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION HAS REMAINED ELUSIVE. TODAY THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH CONTRACTION IN THIS AREA THAT TO MANY AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF RECYCLING CENTER NEARBY GROCERS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW CURRENTLY TO TAKE BACK THE CONTAINERS. OR PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY FINE. BUT MOST TRAGICALLY IS THAT MORE AND MORE CONTAINERS THAT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE RECYCLED RECYCLED ARE ENDING UP IN OUR LANDFILLS OUR WATERWAYS. AND ARE OCEAN SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS BROKEN. IN FACT IN THE LATEST ANNUAL REPORT PUBLISHED BY RECENT CAO RECYCLE THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING RATE HAS NOW FALLEN FIVE PERCENT SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THIS DOWNWARD TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ABSENT IMMEDIATE CHANGES. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE IS NOT A PANACEA BUT IT ATTEMPTS TO TAKE SMALL STEPS TO IMPROVE AND MODERNIZE THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM BY. AUTHORIZING CAO RECYCLE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE IMPROVE CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS. BY REMOVING OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS WE HOPE TO ENABLE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION WITHIN THE BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF FUN APPREHENSION AROUND PROVIDING CAO RECYCLE WITH THIS AUTHORITY BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. ON DEFINING CONVENIENCE JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR STATUS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA. AND I ASK FOR YOUR BY BOAT. THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE GO FORWARD. MARK VERY WITH CALIFORNIA'S AGAINST WASTE UP WERE GOOD SUPPORT IN CONCEPT LIKE THE GENERAL THRUST OF THE LEGISLATION NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED YET ABOUT THE IDEA OF DEFERRING THAT'S REGULATION AS OPPOSED TO JUST. LET'S GET IT DONE IN THE STATUTE. BUT URGED AN AYE VOTE IN TERMS OF AFFECTING THE BILL TAX. BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TONY GONZALEZ REPRESENTING TOM READ NORTH AMERICA A. BOTTLE BILL TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER WHICH HAS BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE SOME TIME OF VERY PREVALENT AND. EUROPEAN IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. WE THINK SENATE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM FOR. REALLY REVIEWS BE VISITING THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY AND AND THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO WORK FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. IN OTHER A DEPOSIT SYSTEMS AND GO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH A STAKEHOLDERS AND STAFF TO CONTINUE WORK ON THE BILL THANK YOU. IF OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SYDNEY OUT OF EVERY PLANET IN SUPPORT. DROPPED MY. ALRIGHT WITH THE YOUR CLOTHES MISTER BLOOM HAVE. I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO CLOSE THIS UP OF THE ANNIE. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. COMMENTS QUESTIONS MISTER NUMBERS THAT MISTER BILL I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOCALS WILL STILL HAVE. I DON'T SEE ANYWHERE IN HERE WERE TALKS ABOUT LOCAL AUTHORITY JOB I'M SERVING ON A CITY COUNCIL AND LIVING IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT HAD PLENTY OF. A. CONVENIENCE ON OPENING UP THAT. DREW A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO GOING TO PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS AND COLLECT THINGS IN THAT CAMP OUT OVERNIGHT. OPEN UP IN THE MORNING. A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS WITH RECYCLING CENTERS. A SO I'M WONDERING AS THESE ARE BEING DEVELOPED HOW LOCALS ARE STILL ABLE TO WEIGH IN TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE ONE OF ITS A PROBLEM OR HAVE SOME KIND JURISDICTION. AROUND WHERE THESE GO. SO AT THE BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AS IT IS CURRENTLY THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS THINGS STAND NOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO HAVE. I'M AUTHORITY AND WERE NOT INTENDED TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. BUT IF WE'RE ALLOWING COVER CYCLE TO CREATE A NEW STANDARDS IS THAT NOT. MEAN WILL THE LOCALS BEAT. TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. YES. WE'LL SEE. WE WELCOME ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. BLOOM I WANTED TO WERE. URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE RECYCLERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS CONSUMERS. AYE AND RECEIVED A CONCERN THAT. THE BILL INITIALLY GRANTED TOO MUCH AUTHORITY CAL RECYCLE WITH NO PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS. AND SO I ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO. ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS WE DO LIKE CLOTHES YES SITE BECOME ATTACHED TO IT BUT A AT THE HIP TO ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THIS POINT AFTER HAVING WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR ABOUT. THREE YEARS. IT IT'S VERY COMPLICATED AND AND TOUGH AND I'M. HOPEFUL THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET US TO A PLACE WHERE THINGS START TO IMPROVE AND I ASK. RESPECTFULLY FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH THE SLAB BILL HAS A. SUPPORT SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION. ITEM FOURTEEN AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY THREE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS RATS IF YOU AYE REFUGEE AYE ACOSTA AYE AYE CONSTANT AYE CHAU. CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA AYE LIMON. LIMON AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ. LINDA'S IRENAEUS. REYES AYE STONE. SO NINE TEN ZERO. DON'T GO OUT THANK YOU. MR GARCIA. BACK FOR MORE. YEAH. ALRIGHT. WE HAVE TWO BILLS. ITEM NUMBER TWO AB NINETEEN SEVENTY. AND. ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN AB TWENTY FOUR FIFTY THREE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES ALSO WITH A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY PROP TODAY TO PRESENT. THIS BILL TO PROMOTE INNOVATIVE FUEL DEVELOPMENT. S. VAMANA THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPTED COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. TO STAB JUSTICE AS A PILOT PROGRAM LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORK WITH YOU. TO FIND THAT LANGUAGE. FORGET INTO WHAT THE BILL DOES. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AYE HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO. AS IN THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED. FIRST A BILL NOT TAKING THE COUNTRY POSITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S ZERO MISSION TRUST TRANSPORTATION GOALS. IN FACT AT LEAST ONE OF FEELS THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT TODAY HYDROGEN IS A ZERO EMISSION FUEL THAT'S ONE POINT. POINT THEY RAISE THE BILL IS NOT TAKING FUNDING FROM A NOBLE NATURAL GAS PROJECTS THE STATUS OF OVERALL FUNDING FOR BIOFUELS PRODUCTION THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR STATES. NOTHING MITIGATION EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS IS A SEPARATE ALTHOUGH RELATED DISCUSSION. AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE THAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO IS. NOT JUST ABOUT BENEFITING A COMPANY OR A FUEL THE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL DEFINITION FOR INNOVATIVE LOW CARBON FUEL IN THE BILL WILL APPLY TO A VARIETY OF FUELS. ON THE HORIZON TODAY IN ADDITION TO THE NEW FUELS WE HAVE NOT YET IDENTIFIED. HE BE NINETEEN SEVENTIES ABOUT LIGHTING OR MULTIPLE POLICY GOES TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA MEETS OUR CLIMATE TARGETS WHILE ALSO DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN BENEFIT OTHER JURISDICTIONS. THAT DON'T HAVE OUR RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. SEVERAL YEARS INTO OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE ARE HEARING THAT NEW AND INNOVATIVE FUEL PROVIDERS ARE HAVING TROUBLE ACCESSING STATE. RESOURCES WHEN COMPETING WITH FIRST GENERATION FEELS THAT HISTORICALLY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDY AND ARE LESS RISKY TWO PROJECT DEVELOPERS. WHAT WE WANT TO FUND? INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL MEET THE NEED OF COMPLIANCE ENTITIES TODAY. WE WOULD MISS AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL OPPORTUNITY IF WE DIDN'T USE SOME OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDING. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL TAKE US FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE. THIS WILL BENEFIT COMPANIES LIKE THOSE OF MY DISTRICT. BUT ALSO COMPANIES LIKE THEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHO ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GAINING ACCESS TO RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ENTER THE MARKET AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCENTIVES AVAILABLE. THROUGH LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD CREDITS. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY WOULD HELP PUSH CALIFORNIAN COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO BE THE WORLD LEADER IN CLEANTECH INNOVATION ARCH YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING I REBEKAH BUJOR ON THE PRESIDENT OF OBERON FEELS ON MY PC CHEMIST BY TRAINING AND FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE WORKED FOR START UP COMPANIES THE LAST SEVEN OF WHICH WITH OBERON. EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY IS ABOUT PROMISING NEW FUELS AND SUPPORTING THEM THROUGH THE VALLEY OF DEATH. MOVING A CONSTANT UP FROM A CONCEPT AN IDEA TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION PHASE. STARTED BY TWO SAN DIEGO ENTREPRENEURS O'BRIEN'S THEY CALIFORNIA HIM COMPANY FOCUS ON CONVERTING WASEEM SEE DMB A CLEAN BURNING DIESEL REPLACEMENT. DB PERFORMS LIKE DIESEL BUT GENERATES NO PARTICULAR MATTER HELPS CONTROL KNOCKS AND OFFER SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED ONE PERCENT REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GASES WERE MADE FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES. OVER THE PAST SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS INVESTORS HAVE PUT OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A PRIVATE FUNDING INTO O'BRIEN RECEIVING ZERO DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING. AND ZERO AND FEDERAL FUNDING. AROUND HAS A DEMONSTRATION FACILITY IN IMPERIAL VALLEY. PROVIDING FUEL FOR DEEMING TRIALS AROUND THE WORLD REVOLVER TRACKS MAC IN FORT. WITH ALL THIS PROGRESS HOWEVER WE'RE STILL NOT AT THE POINT OF COMMERCIALIZATION WE HAVE NOT MADE IT THROUGH THE VALLEY OF DETH. THREE REASONS THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT CALIFORNIA MAY FEELS AND CALIFORNIA INNOVATION. AROUSE ONE COMPANY AMONG MANY COMPANIES LIKE THIS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE INDUSTRIAL MICROBES A SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA COMPANY STARTED BY A GROUP OF BRILLIANT MICROBIOLOGISTS IS USING BACTERIA TO CONVERT NOTHING TO CHEMICALS AND FEELS. AND THIS TECHNOLOGIES VERTICALLY PROMISING CONVERTING DAIRY MANEUVER TO FUELS EXPRESSLY SMALL DAIRY FARMS REYES NO ECONOMICALLY VIABLE SOLUTION TODAY FOR THEIR DAIRY BIOGAS. TOO MANY PROMISING TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP CALIFORNIA REACHES ADMISSIONS GOALS WON'T WILL DIE ON THE VINE IF WE DON'T HELP BRIDGE THE VALLEY OF DEATH. NUMBER THREE THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF GREAT MOLECULES. WHILE RENEWABLE DME HYDROGEN AND PROPANE ARE CALLED OUT AS EXAMPLES IN THIS BILL.

A GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF A WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. A. AS MENTIONED. ALL AFTERNOON CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY SUFFERING FROM AN UNDISPUTED HOUSING SHORTAGE. OF THE STATE NEEDS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND NEW HOMES PER YEAR TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DEMAND. BUT PRODUCES ONLY A HUNDRED AND APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND. OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE NEEDED BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO MEET INDUSTRIES DEMANDS. BUILDERS SAY THAT LABOR SHORTAGES WERE SITTING AT THE SAME TIME DEMAND FOR CONSTRUCTION IS INCREASING. ROUGHLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF CONSTRUCTION FIRMS ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FILLING HOURLY CRAFT POSITIONS RESULTING IN MANY FIRMS STRUGGLING TO PREVENT LABORS FROM WALKING OFF THE JOB. MADE PROJECT TO WORK FOR ANOTHER COMPANY. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS HELPS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS MANY OF WHOM ARE AT RISK MINORITIES GAIN VALUABLE. EXPERIENCE REBUILDING TRAILS PREVENTING AND FIGHTING WILDFIRES AND FLOODS AND INSTALLING ENERGY EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES. COR MEMBERS EARN MINIMUM WAGE WILL SOONER MONTHLY STIPEND FOR THEIR WORK AND ALSO COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSEWORK. MANY CORPS MEMBERS CREATE CREDIT THE PROGRAM WITH HELPING THEM TO GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK AND ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FIVE WILL CREATE THE CONSTRUCTION CORPS PILOT PROGRAM WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TO PROVIDE AT RISK YOUTH THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN CARPENTRY. MASONRY DRY WALL ROOFING ANOTHER CONSTRUCTION RELATED SKILLS TO MEET THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR SKILLED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. DID THE BILL WILL EXPAND THE DEMONSTRABLY SUCCESSFUL CAUGHT CONSERVATION CORPS MODEL AND HELP THE STATE TRAIN MORE MINORITY IN LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS FOR JOBS AND CAREER FIELD PAN AVERAGE OF FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR MORE HOUSING AND LABOR TO SUPPORT ITS CONSTRUCTION. ESTABLISHING A CONSERVATION A CONSTRUCTION CORPS CAN ASSIST THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BY REDUCING TURNOVER OF SKILLED EMPLOYEES AND INCREASING DIVERSITY AMONG LABORERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WILL GIVE A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR LIVES ON TRACK. AND BREAK A CYCLE OF POVERTY AND CRIME THAT ARE TYPICAL OF THE COMMUNITIES. THESE CORE MEMBERS COME FROM. ESTABLISHING CONSTRUCTION CORPS WITHIN CALLOUS CONSERVATION CORPS ENABLES THE PROGRAM TO REACH ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE. WITH OVER TWO DOZEN RESIDENTIAL AND NON RESIDENTIAL CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE CONSTRUCTION CORPS CAN PARTNER WITH LOCAL TRAINING PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND BUILDERS TO RIDE THE RELEVANT TRAINING AND EXPERTISE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY IS RICHARD MARCUS AND WHO WILL. GO AHEAD SORRY IT MISTER CHAIRMAN. IN MEMBERS SO RICHARD MARX AND FOR THE SOCIT BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS. IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT SOME POTENTIAL OPPOSITION THAT WHAT THIS IS REALLY INTENDED TO DO IS TO. DEVELOPED IN VIS A AT RISK YOUTH OF AN APPRECIATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS IS ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT. IT DEPLOYING A HUNDREDS OF THESE FOLKS. TO REPLACE EXPERIENCE DURING WORKERS ARE REPLACE ANYONE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUT TO GIVE THEM A TASTE OF WHAT IT IS OUGHT TO BE A SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING IN SOME OF THE OTHER FIELDS. A IT IS A AND A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. TO LEARN A CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES AND TO THEN CONSIDER A WHETHER THEY WOULD WANT TO GO INTO A REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OR INTO SOME OTHER CRAFT TRAINING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO BECOME ACCOMPLISHED JOURNEY WORKERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD. A IT'S A GOOD A PLACE FOR THEM TO START WE SUPPORTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS READ AT US ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL CONSERVATION CORPS AS WE HEARD TODAY IS A AND SUPPORTING CONCEPT. THAT WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT WE'VE APPRECIATED TALKING TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WE APPRECIATE HIS INITIATIVE AND THE DIRECTION HE'S HEADING. WELL WE'RE JUST GONNA CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM THAT IS FOCUSED IN THOSE AREAS WHERE IT'S NEEDED AND MAKE SURE WE DON'T DUPLICATE IN OTHER AREAS WHERE MAYBE IT'S NOT NEEDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAINST PORN CONCEPT THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. BAKER ANGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NINE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL A WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. A WE THINK THE COMMITTEE OF FOR THE AND THEN IT'S A NARROW THE BILL. THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BUT WE UNFORTUNATELY STILL LEFT TO OPPOSE. MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE REMAIN LANGUAGE IN THE BILL UP QUOTE SAYS OF THE PURPOSES STATED QUOTE TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED WORKERS INCREASE THE STATE'S A PLAN HOUSING AND HELP CORPS MEMBERS FIND CONSTRUCTION LABOR JOBS. WE DISAGREE FIRST OF ALL WHAT THE FINAL CONCEPT THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THERE ARE FIFTY THREE THOUSAND APPRENTICES. IN THE STATE TO PUT THE PRESSURE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW FIFTY THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE THE LABOR PROGRAMS. OUR COUNCIL ALONE REPRESENTS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AS ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS BEHIND THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE IS ED THEM. DECISION BY DEVELOPERS AND CONTRACTORS TO NOT PAY LIVING WAGES TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TEAR UP EARNED TO. ATTRACT THEM TO THE PROFESSION. THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL OF SHOWN TIME AND AGAIN. THAT THEY ARE AMONG THE GROUPS WHO ROUTINELY OPPOSE A SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND A FAIR WAGE STANDARDS FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS. TO. PAYKAN STRUCTURAL HERS AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE DID YOU WORK. THE AUTHOR THE BILL SAID IT CORRECTLY CAL CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS EARN THE MINIMUM WAGE. SO WE OF COURSE TO PEOPLE TO BE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO WILL THEN EARN THE MINIMUM WAGE INSTEAD OF OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WAGES THE CONSTRUCTION PACE NOW. SECONDLY CONSTRUCTION AS WE ALL KNW IN THE ROOM WAS ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS JOBS AROUND. TWENTY ONE PERCENT OF THE. FATALITIES IN PRIVATE INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WASN'T CONSTRUCTION THAT NUMBERS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ALL FATALITIES IN CALIFORNIA. KEY COMPONENT OF CONSTRUCTION TRAINING IS THIS HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPONENT. OF THE TYPICAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM DEPENDING ON THE CRAFT IS BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE YEARS A LARGE PART OF THAT TIME NO MATTER WHAT CRAFT IS. BECAUSE LEARNING HEALTH AND SAFETY. BEST PRACTICES. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS BY A IN AND IT. IS A STATUTORY STATUTORILY REQUIRED ONE YEAR PROGRAM. SO CORPS MEMBERS IN IT FOR ONE YEAR THERE'S N WAY THERE'S ENOUGH TIME FOR CORPS MEMBER IN THE PRO IN THE PILOT PROGRAM TO LEARN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS. FUN BEST PRACTICES THEY NEED TO KNOW TO BE SAFE ON A JOB SITE. AND ALL WRAPPED UP WITH THIS. BY ASSUMING THAT ANYONE. CAN DO CONSTRUCTION WORK. IT'S DIMINISHING IN OUR OPINION THE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND DETAILED TRAINING. THAT OUR CRAFTS UNDERTAKE. WE HAVE NO DOUBT THE AUTHOR VALUES THE WORK OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. BUT AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FIVE IN OUR OPINION WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS CREATING A POOL OF WORKERS WHO WILL WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE. THEREBY TAKING CONSTRUCTION CAREER JOBS AWAY FROM JOURNEY MEN AND WOMEN. AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES AWAY FROM APPRENTICES TO LEARN THE CRAFT THERE'S ALREADY A PLACE TO LEARN HOW TO BE CONSTRUCTION WORKER IT'S IN THE STATE OF PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. THIS BILL HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORTH UNDER THE GUISE OF A COME. SEE OF LACK OF CONSTRUCTION OR THE STATE WE JUST BUT AMENITIES AGREE WITH THAT WE URGE OR KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. THE CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MONEY GONNA BE HALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A CALIFORNIA STATE PIPE TRADES COUNCIL. THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL OF SHEET METAL WORKERS IN INTERNATIONAL UNION OF ELEVATOR CONSTRUCTORS. WITHOUT DELIVERING THE POINTS THAT MISTER SMITH MADE I THINK IT'S SIMPLE NOT TO SAY THAT IF YOU WANNA LEARN HOW TO DO CONSTRUCTION WORK. YOU NEED TO BE IN A JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THANK YOU. MY QUEST ON BEHALF OF INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES DISTRICT COUNCIL SIXTEEN IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MURS MITCH DYER WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING QUE DONAHUE DURAN WITH THE CITY COUNCIL LABORERS JUST WONDERED BRIEFLY APOLOGIZE TO COMMITTEE FIRST MEETING ARE LITTERED LATE LAST WEEK AND ALSO NOTE THAT WE. DID SPEAK WITH THE AUTHOR STOP THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THIS IS PATH LEADING. TO ME TO LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION COME FORWARD AND SUGGEST THAT IF WE ALLOW THE CONSERVATION CORPS TO HAVE THIS PROGRAM THAT IT WILL PUT THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OUT OF WORK THAT IS. FASCINATING TO ME ALSO FLATLY FOX. I THIS IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP AT RISK YOUTH NOTHING MORE. THEY GET INTO THIS PROGRAM THEN THEY'D THEY CAN PERHAPS. FIGURE OUT. IF THAT'S AN AREA OF INDUSTRY THEY WANT TO GO INTO AT ALL MAYBE THEY DO MAYBE THEY DON'T. BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED FOR IF IF YOU'VE BEEN TO ONE IN THESE CAMPS. I MEAN. I HAVE ONE OF OUR I HAVE BECAUSE REGION CORPS IN MY DISTRICT THAT I VISITS MASSIVE I'M IT'S INCREDIBLE WHAT THESE KIDS DO THEIR THE YOUNG ADULTS. THIS IS ON OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO LEARN TO LEARN SOME SKILLS IN TREES A DANE HAVE PREVIOUSLY PERHAPS THEY DIDN'T THEY THEN. GROPING A HOUSEHOLD WHERE SOMEBODY WAS MEANT TOURING THEM AND TEACHING THEM THESE TYPES OF. TRADES SKILLS THAT THEY MAY NEED THIS IS. BUT THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON LABOR THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON IT. THE TRAINING THAT LABOR UNIONS PROVIDE I ASSURE YOU THERE WILL NOT BE. AT A BATTLE FOR JOBS IF THE CONSERVATION CORPS ALLOWS THIS TRAINING PROGRAM GOING TO PLACE A PROMISE SHE SAT. I'M. MR ACCOSTED YOU I DON'T IF YOU WANT ADDRESSING YOUR CLOTHES OR NOW BUT I'M JUST WONDERING DO YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF COMMENT OR REBUTTAL TO THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND BEFORE YOU. ANSWER THAT THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. THE IN THINKING AS WANT IS THAT YOU KNOW I'M I'M A LITTLE BUT BEFUDDLED ONLY BECAUSE. WE HAD NO OPPOSITION UNTIL FRANKLY THURSDAY NIGHT WHICH WERE ALL GONE AND. EARLY THIS MORNING AND IT'S IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING WHEN OUR FIRST MEETINGS WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS WERE IN JANUARY. I I'M I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW KEEP KEEP MY COMPOSURE BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE AT RISK YOUTH. THAT ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE. I AM. BUT I'M GONNA STICK TO MS MELENDEZ SPECIFIC QUESTION OR COMMENT ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE. YOU KNOW THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE BILL BUT IF IF THE. OPPOSITION WAS LISTENING. AND AYE I'VE NEVER BEEN ACCUSED OF NOT BEING ALLOWED ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME. I ALSO STATED THAT THESE JOBS AVERAGE FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE FOLKS. THAT'S WHAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS HERE'S TO EXPOSE AT RISK YOUTH USE AT RISK YOUTH. IT'S LATE AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN SOMETHING DIFFERENT BESIDES. THE CHALLENGES OF THEIR LIFE GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE REST OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TO EARN THEIR G. E. DIS THESE ARE YOUNG. PEOPLE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT. THIRD THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS IN MANY MANY CASES. THESE ARE A YOUNG KIDS THAT AREN'T BEING PICKED UP BY THESE UNION APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH GOD BLESS THEM THAT THEY'RE THERE THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT NOT EVERYBODY FITS INTO ONE MODEL WE HEARD ABOUT. SO MANY IN SO MANY OF OUR BILLS TODAY WE HEARD ABOUT HOW. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL DOESN'T FIT ALL FOR THE WHOLE STATE EVERY TIME WE HAVE A HEARING IN WILL IN IN ONE COMMITTEE AFTER ANOTHER. WERE GETTING ACCUSED OF TRYING TO DO A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WELL HERE I HAVE THE OPPOSITION UP YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THERE ONE SIZE FITS ALL ANSWER. WORKS FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN THIS STATE AND I HAVE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT. HAD IT NOT BEEN AFTER MY FATHER DIED WHEN I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD FOR A MAN NAMED BOB KANA. WHO TOOK ME UNDER HIS WING ALONG WITH MY FRIEND MY BEST FRIEND WHO WHO IS HIS SON? AND KEPT ME VERY BUSY IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I HAVE WORKED IN INSULATION IN ATTICS PUTTING AND LAYING INSULATION IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN THE SUMMER. I WAS A LOT THINNER THAN SITE THAT FIT TO THE RAFTERS A LITTLE BETTER. AND I AND I'VE DONE PLUMBING AND I'VE DONE ELECTRICAL WORK AND I'VE WORKED IN A AUTOMOTIVE GARAGES ET CETERA. I KNOW WHAT THESE JOBS ENTAIL AND I KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO ELEVATE SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BY GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY AND A SHOT. AND I HE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. BUT WE IT WILL BUT FOR NOT A GUY LIKE BOB CONNELL AND A FEW OTHERS IN MY LIFE I DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD BE TODAY. I CERTAINLY WOULD BE MARRIED TO A BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL WIFE WITH THREE AMAZING CHILDREN. AND SERVING IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE STATE LEGISLATURE MOST LIKELY. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS. THIS BILL IS KEY IS BORN OUT OF ONE THING AND THAT'S A PASSION FOR OUR YOUTH. A PASSION FOR KIDS THAT NEED AN OPPORTUNITY. AN OPPORTUNITY THERE I'M ALL OF US SITTING AROUND ERE TODAY EVERYONE IN THIS AUDIENCE HAS HAD SOMEONE THEIR LIFE. SOMEBODY GIVE HIM A SHOT. AND WHEN I HERE. THE THESE THESE THE THE OPPOSITION I AM LIKE WAR WHERE YOU I'M I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THESE ISSUES LET'S LET'S. IMPROVE THIS BILL BUT THIS REALLY IF IF IF IF BILL IS BE IMPROVED. BUT. THE. LAKE OPPOSITION IS PROBABLY THE MOST STRESS RESTFUL THING FOR ANY OF US. THAT'S THAT WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU'VE REACHED OUT YOU'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD MEETINGS YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK YOU DON YOU DO DILIGENCE AND THE LAST MINUTE. POOF WORK WERE OBJECTING TO YOUR BILL AND I REALLY RESENT THAT. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT TODAY. IS THE. IMPACT. THAT THIS KIND OF A PROGRAM WILL HAVE ON A FEW KIDS LIVES. IN OUR STATE. AND. YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AYE I WENT ON AFTER A QUESTION IF THERE'S ANY MORE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED THEM. THERE. AS THIS BILL AND YOU SHORT I. AND PANEL AND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AT. I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY VISIT SOME OF THESE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THAT OUR AT LABOR. BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE PUT TOGETHER AND. YOU MADE A COMMENT THAT THESE ARE NOT THE TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT ARE PICKED UP. I HAVE SEEN. OTHERWISE. I ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN THESE APPRENTICESHIP BUT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY LABOR WHO DO. I HAVE REALLY DIVERSE. A WITH MEN AND WOMEN OF DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE. THIS YEAR OF SOME REENTRY SOME NEW AND SO HOW WHAT WHAT. WHEN YOU SAY THAT THIS IS NOT IT WHAT REALLY MAKES YOUR PROGRAM DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY'RE PROVIDING AND. AND YET BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE I GUESS I EXPLAINED THE SAME HE'S YEAH YOU JUMP GROUP YEAH YOU YOU HONED IN ON THAT BY THE WAY. I I BELIEVE I SAID OFTENTIMES BUT IF I DIDN'T I I CERTAINLY MEANT THAT ONE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS AND ALSO THE THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. IS THE FACT THAT YOU'RE THEIR GED. WHILE THEY'RE DOING THIS PROGRAM WHILE EARNING BURNING MONEY GETTING A GED AND ALSO LEARNING VALUABLE SKILLS I THINK THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE MOST OF THOSE BUT THAT DOESN'T DEFINING FACTORS BUT TO SAY. THAT. ONLY ONE WHAT DOES ONE PATH AND IS ONLY ONE PATH. I I YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS BUILDS LITTLE LITTLE BRIDGES OVER CREEK THEY HAVE IN MY DISTRICT. AND MAYBE LABOR DOESN'T LIKE THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WHY IS THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS SO SUCCESSFUL IN SO MANY AREAS OF OUR STATE. AND I THINK THIS ISN'T JUST A SMALL ADDITION TO THEIR MISSION US AT A A SLIGHT VARIATION ON THE THEME YOU KNOW IT BASICALLY BUILT ON THE SAME KIND OF OF SKILLS. AND THIS IS ANOTHER AVENUE IN ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR MAYBE SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T FIT THERE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE AT THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE ANYBODY DO ANYTHING CERTAINLY THAT THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT AFTER THEY'VE DONE THIS AND GOTTEN A TASTE AND GOT MY GED THEN THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE VALUABLE TO THE SOPRANO SHIP PROGRAMS. AS THEY GO FORWARD SO IF I MISSPOKE I APOLOGIZE. AND THIS CERTAINLY DIDN'T THERE IS NO MENTION IN HERE OF ANYTHING ABOUT LABOR THIS IS ABOUT THE KIDS. AND SO LAST MINUTE WE WE DO GET THE OPPOSITION. I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THEM SINCE JANUARY SINCE WE REACHED OUT AND I CONTINUE TO WORK WORK WITH ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO INCLUDING YOURSELF THAT WAS STOLEN FROM A SPELL. AND MAKE IT THE BEST BILL POSSIBLE FOR KIDS. THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE MISTER COST AYE FIVE MINUTES THE ENTIRE DEBATE TO THIS THING START OVER TO ONE SURE WHAT TIDES AND MAYBE WE COULD FOR HIM. WE'RE HERE ALL NIGHT SPRING UP ON MISTER SMITH FROM THE US FOOD. BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. REPEAT WHAT HE ARE THE SENATE FOR THE AYE AYE WHY I MISS STEP OFF THE QUESTION. SO I I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL WE ALL OF THE CONSERVATION CORPS IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT PROGRAMS GOVERNOR CREATE OF COURSE THAT. I'M HEADS I AM FAMILIAR A LITTLE BIT TOO LOCALLY FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL THE REHAB THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THERE IS THAT. THERE IS THAT THE UNION. AND PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM HERE AND CCT. THERE'S A YOUTH BUILD KIND OF A CONSERVATION CORPS TYPE PROGRAM AND THEIR PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND SO IS THE IDEA YOU'RE CUTTING HERE BE A FULL SAIL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM MORE. LIKE A TRADITIONAL PRE APPRENTICE PROGRAM TO PREPARE PEOPLE TO MAYBE ENGAGED WITH THAT STATE BUILDING. TRAITS ADDRESSED MY IF YOU ASKED HIM AYE I'LL ASK YOU FOR OKAY THAT YEAH IT ASK YOU CANCERS THAT YEAH Y. AGAIN HAS THE FIRST WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO GOOD TO SEE CERTAIN APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. I ENVISION IT AS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY NOTHER AVENUE FOR LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AS AS A AT THE END YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. TO BASICALLY BE ABLE TO EXPAND IT SLIGHTLY BE ABLE TO HAVE THE STUDENTS GET THEIR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE GET THEIR GED SO DON'T HAVE THEM THESE ARE THIS IS GEARED TOWARD EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS. AND TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP SOME VALUABLE LIFE SKILLS WHAT THEY DO WITH THOSE LIFE SKILLS AFTER AS MENTIONED A YEAR. GOD BLESS MY HOPE THEY GO INTO A FULL FULL FLEDGED. YOU KNOW UNION PROGRAM OR OTHERWISE WHATEVER THEY DECIDE TO DO BUT TO ASSUME THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BE. SLOTTED DOWN ONE WAY I THINK IS. IT IS IS NOT ACCURATE IT CERTAINLY WAS I WORK A LOT OF. JOBS LIKE THAT AND I'M NOT AND I I'VE BEEN IN THE SUIT AND TIE. SIX TO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK PROBABLY EXCEPT ON WEEKENDS WHEN I'M REBUILDING CARS ARE RETYPING MY HOUSE. I. UNDERSTAND WHERE THESE KIDS ARE COMING FROM A WE NEED TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY ANOTHER. IT VENUE SO TO ANSWER QUESTION I THINK I LOOK AT IT IS MORE OF A OF A. PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WOULD BE MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THERE IS TO IT YOU WANNA ENGAGE ON THAT AS FAR AS YOU KNOW COULD THIS BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO ENHANCE THE EXISTING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM STRUCK CALIFORNIAN BE LEN ABOUT PIPELINE AS A CAB PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION TO THE CHAIR I WOULD I WOULD ANSWER THAT. YOU KNOW PRE APPRENTICESHIP IS VERY VITAL. WHAT'S BUT WHAT. WE HAVE FOUND OFTEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES IS. UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY WANT TO BE AN IRON WORKER. AND THEY GET TO THE FORTY FLOOR. AND THEY REALIZE THAT GIVING I WORKER. THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES LIKE THAT'S A PREPRESS SHIPPED IS A SORT OF VERY GOOD PURPOSE AND. I LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S. IS OUT THERE WHAT A CONSTRUCTION CAREER IS LIKE AND WE HAVE OUR OWN A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT EXPOSES. A THE. PREFERENCES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY HOURS OF BUT. OF STUDY A OF ALL THE CRAFTS TOGETHER MY IDEA. OF ABOUT WHAT A CRAFT IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE TRISH KNOWS WHAT A PLUMBER IS AND WHAT THEY DO. AS A PRE PARTNERSHIP IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE. BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW. SINCE. NINETY OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE STATE APPROVED A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THE UNION PROGRAMS THAT USING THE CURRICULUM. THAT THEY WOULD GIVE ENTRANCE INTO THE MOST NUMBER OF THOSE PROGRAMS MAKES THE MOST SENSE WHEN IT COMES A PAIR PARTNERSHIP. AND I WOULD JUST FINISH BY SAYING. THAT. WHEN IT COMES AT RISK YOUTH. JUST THE MOST OF THE THAT THE THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE I HAVE IS THAT FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. THE IRON WORKERS UNION FRESNO TOOK IN THREE HUNDRED APPRENTICES HALF OF WHOM DID NOT HAVE THEIR GED. THE IRON WORKERS UNION WORK WITH ALL OF THEM TO GET THEIR GED IS AND THEN THEY BECAME APPRENTICES. SO WE ARE ALL ABOUT AT RISK YOUTH WE ARE ALL ABOUT THE PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT PIPELINE AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO PUT PEOPLE TO WORK WHETHER THERE. ARE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. TO FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED AND THEN I'LL FINALLY SAY THE OTHER WAY TO DO THIS IS TO INCREASE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOLS. GIVE THESE KIDS GIVE THESE YOUNG KIDS AN IDEA OF WHAT IT IS TO WORK WITH YOUR HANDS AND LET THEM KNOW THERE'S A WORLD OF WORK OUT THERE DOES REQUIRE FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY DEGREE. SO I PREVENT YOUR QUESTIONS MCCARTY I I JUST WITH JUST ONE THING. YOU KNOW I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THAT ANY. YEAH I NEED. ORGANIZATION THE IRON WORKERS ARE HELPING THE STUDENTS GET THEIR GED SAYS A STRUCTURED PROGRAM. THAT THEY WILL BE GETTING THEIR GT'S. SHOULD THEY COMPLETED OF COURSE AND IT NO WAY INTERFERES WITH ANYTHING ANYONE IS DOING AND ORGANIZED LABOR AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE INTENT. OF THE INTENT IS. IF THE IF THE GOAL IS TO HELP. AT RISK YOUTH AND AS STATED BY THE OPPOSITION THEY'RE ALL ABOUT THAT. WE BROUGHT THIS TO THEM IN JANUARY WE'D LOVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. IDEA I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU IF YOU REALLY MEAN THAT THEN. RIVER OPPOSITION LET'S WORK ON THIS BILL TOGETHER AND LET'S MOVE IT FORWARD AND HELP THESE KIDS. BUT I SENSE THAT SINCE WE TALKED ABOUT IN JANUARY WERE IN APRIL NOW AND MORE IT FISCAL DEADLINES ETCETERA. WITH THIS LATE OPPOSITION. ALL I CAN. ALL I CAN ASSUME IS THAT MAYBE THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE MOTIVE AND I APOLOGIZE BUT IT IS LATE AND. IT'S IT'S A BIT FRUSTRATING TO. THE HOUSE AND LET OUR I RESPECTFULLY. FOR THE KIDS ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE YOUR SUPPORT. RIGHT. IS WOULD. THE. I AM MAKING AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY FIVE BY MEMBER ACOSTA THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

PRESENTING AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE YOU CAN START WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. ARB BASED ON BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND INFORMATION. TO QUANTIFY AND REPORT IN A STEEP GXT INVENTORY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GHG EMISSIONS. RESULTING FROM THE LOSS OR RELEASE OF UNCOMPRESSED IT THEIR NATURAL GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL GAS FLARES DURING ALL PROCESSES. ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION PROCESSING AND TRANSPORTATION OF NATURAL GAS THAT IS IMPORTED INTO THE STATE FROM OUT OF STATE SOURCES. CALIFORNIA IMPORTED POSSIBLY NINETY PERCENT OF OUR NATURAL GAS USED IN THE STATE. THE GAS IS USED TO HEAT HOMES AND BUSINESSES GENERATE ELECTRICITY AND POWER VEHICLES HOWEVER BEFORE THAT GAS REACHES ITS END USER. A PERCENTAGE IS LOST TO THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH LEAKAGE INVENTING AND FLARING DURING PRODUCTION PROCESSING AND TRANSPORTATION. MY THING THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF NATURAL GAS IS EIGHTY FOUR TIMES MORE POTENT THAN CARBON DIOXIDE. AT TRAPPING HEAT OVER THE COURSE OF ITS FIRST TWENTY YEARS IN THE ATMOSPHERE LEADING TO SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IF A LARGE AMOUNT OF GAS IS LOST INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. CURRENTLY A RB ONLY CALCULATES IN STATE NATURAL GAS COMBUSTION AND LEAKAGE EVEN THOUGH IN STATE USES RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNIFICANT. A POLLUTION OUTSIDE STATE. ACCORDINGLY MILLIONS OF TONS OF GX SHE POLLUTION GO AND ACCOUNTED. FOR EVERY YEAR. AS A RESULT THE TRUE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL GAS USE IS HIDDEN FROM THE STATE'S INVENTORY CONSUMERS AND POLICY MAKERS. THIS BILL AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE WILL HELP THE STATE MORE ACCURATELY CAO EMISSIONS SO THE PUBLIC AND POLICYMAKERS CAN CLEARLY UNDERSTAND. THE SIZE AND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM OF LEAKY HL RELATED TO THE USE OF NATURAL GAS IN OUR STATE. AND ALSO ENSURE THAT THE ACCURATE EVALUATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE STATE'S NATURAL GAS UP POLICIES. OUR I HAVE ONE WITNESS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL MISTER MARK GUYS WOULD YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELF PLACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MARK FENSTER MAKER ON BEHALF OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND SPONSORED AB TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO GET BETTER ACCOUNTING OF THE NATURAL GAS IMPACTS. FROM THE IMPORTS OF NATURAL GAS INTO CALIFORNIA. PRIMARY COMPONENT OF NATURAL GAS IS METHANE A POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS. DO THIS POTENCY OF JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGES LAS THE ATMOSPHERE. OUT BEFORE IT REACHES OUR CALIFORNIA'S BORDER CLIMATE CHANGE BENEFIT USE OF THE USE OF NATURAL GAS CAN BE GREATLY UNDERMINED. I CURRENTLY A ARE BE IN ITS INVENTORY ACCOUNTS FOR NOW AFTER OUR FOR. GHG EMISSIONS FROM OTHER AREAS SUCH AS. INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND FOR OTHER. IMPORTED I RESOURCES. FOR THOSE REASONS WE FEEL THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO MOVE FORWARD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SPORT.
