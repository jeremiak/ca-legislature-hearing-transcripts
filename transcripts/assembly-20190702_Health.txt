THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT KNOWS FULL WELL OF HOW OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN GRAPPLING WITH THE CRISIS AROUND THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. SIX FIGURE PRICE TAGS FOR MEDICATIONS THAT TREAT COMPLEX CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS CANCER AND HEPATITIS C.. HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BECOME A REGULAR OCCURRENCE AND WHILE THEY REPRESENT IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGHS FOR PATIENTS THESE PRICES HAVE BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON PATIENTS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. OUR PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOVERNMENT. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR OUR NEW GOVERNOR TOOK BOLD ACTION TO TACKLE DRUG PRICES IN HIS FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER BY LAYING OUT PLANS TO REIN IN. DRUG COSTS THROUGH A STATEWIDE PURCHASING SYSTEM. BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER DID NOT INCLUDE THE SUGGESTION OF WORKING WITH MAJOR PLAYERS FROM OTHER STATES. THIS YEAR THE STATES OF WASHINGTON AND OREGON IN THEIR LEGISLATURE'S THEY INTRODUCED BILLS PURGING -- THEIR LEADERSHIP TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE DRUG PRICES ACROSS THE WEST COAST. THIS IS A RESOLUTION TO MOVE FOR OUR CONVERSATION AND AND SORT US INTO THAT. ARE IT WOULD CONFIRM OUR LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ARE AND ENCOURAGE OUR GOVERNOR TO ENGAGE WITH THE STATES OF WASHINGTON OREGON WHO WISH TO PARTNER WITH OUR STATE -- TO ADDRESS THIS AGAIN ACROSS THE WEST COAST. IF CALIFORNIA TRULY WANTS TO LEAD THE NATION ON TACKLING THIS CRISIS WE NEED TO COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS ACROSS STATE LINES AS WELL AS WITHIN AROUND STATE.

MEDICAID NOW REVERT REIMBURSES IN STATES. THAT HAVE A STATEWIDE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. IT REDUCING THE FINANCIAL BIRD BURDEN. ON OUR COUNTY PROVIDERS. SO CALIFORNIA IS A LITTLE BEHIND. AND WE ARE PEERS HOWEVER THAT WORKED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL DOING AMAZING WORK BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY STATEWIDE CERTIFICATION. THE BILL WILL MAKE SERVICE APPEARS OR OR GET THE TRAINING. THEY NEED TO DO THEIR BEST WORKS AND WILL HELP DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL FUNDS. AND I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES ULTRA MY WITNESS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR ABOUT ALL OF THE AC IN THE STAINED BURKE INSTITUTE -- AND LA COUNTY FOR SPONSORING THIS SPELL. AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS LEGISLATION FOR YEARS. MY NAME IS COLLECT YOU BOZO AND I'M THE PURE AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MANAGER FOR CAL MESA. AND I'M HONORED AND THRILLED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN PEER CERTIFICATION. I AM A FORMER JOURNALIST I AM AN AUTHOR AND I AM ALSO A SUICIDE ATTEMPT SURVIVOR -- WHEN MY MENTAL STRUGGLES? FIRST EMERGE WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD ALWAYS BE SICK BUT I WOULD NEVER GET BETTER -- AND THE BEST I COULD HOPE FOR WAS THAT MANAGING MY MENTAL ILLNESS -- AND MAYBE GETTING A PART TIME JOB. FOR MANY YEARS I INTERNALIZE THOSE BELIEFS AND MY MENTAL HEALTH REALLY DECLINED BECAUSE OF THAT. SO WHAT I NEEDED WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE TO ME -- WITH MENTAL HEALTH TO HOLD OUT HOPE FOR ME TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH RECOVERY AND TO BE A MODEL OF STRENGTH. I NEEDED UP HERE. ON MY PATH TO HEALING WHICH NEVER ENDS -- I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT LEGISLATION AND THE INCLUSION OF PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND COMMUNITY APPEARS. MY EXPERIENCE RECEIVING YOUR SUPPORT CHANGED MY LIFE. WHILE WORKING AT PEERS -- IT'S APPEAR RUN ORGANIZATION IN ALAMEDA COUNTY -- I MET A COHORT OF PEOPLE WHO HAD LIVED EXPERIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND HELPED ME ON LEARN SOME OF THOSE REALLY NEGATIVE PROBLEMATIC THINGS I WAS TOLD -- LIKE THAT I WOULD NEVER GET BETTER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THE OTHER THING THAT THIS WAS HELPFUL IS THAT THEY HELP TO NORMALIZE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. SO ONE OF MY CLOSEST ALLIES GINNY DARDEN -- SHE GAVE ME A PLATFORM TO TELL MY STORY AND LISTENED IN A NON JUDGEMENTAL WAY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I'D EVER TOLD ANYONE THAT I WAS A SUICIDE ATTEMPT SURVIVOR OUTSIDE OF A CLINICAL SETTING. AND AFTER I TOLD HER MY STORY SHE SAID WHILE I'M I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL HERE AND WHAT DO WE DO TO KEEP YOU HERE. SO. NEVER IN MY LIFE HAD I HAD THIS CONVERSATION THAT WAS THIS HONEST AND I REALIZED I WASN'T A BIRD AND I DIDN'T HAVE. TO HIDE AND THE MORE I SPOKE WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIKE ME I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW THEY REALLY HELPED ME FIND MY VOICE. MY YOUNGER SELF DESERVED APPEAR ADVOCATE -- AND DESPITE INCREDIBLE OUT COMES OUT LIKE PEER SUPPORT THAT WE'VE DONE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY -- LIKE A PROGRAM THAT MATCH SOMEONE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO SOMEONE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL WHICH ACTUALLY SHOWED THE DATA SHOWED THAT IT REDUCED. HOSPITALIZATIONS -- IT WAS ATTACHED TO A GRAT WHICH MEANT THAT ONCE THE PROGRAM WAS OVER IT WAS OVER WE NEVER HAD MEDI CAL BILLING SO ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS WERE NOT SUSTAINABLE -- WE NEED TO LEGITIMIZE THE WORK THAT IS ALREADY BEING DONE BY PEERS CURRENTLY AND ALSO CREATE STANDARDIZATION AS SUSTAINABILITY FOR THIS RECOVERY BASED WORK. CALIFORNIA IS RICH IN THE DIVERSITY OF CULTURE RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER EXPRESSION. FOR THESE REASONS I HOPE THAT YOU -- VOTE I ON YOUR VOTE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAITING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK IN SUPPORT OF THE SPELL. THANK YOU SENATOR B&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR YOUR&lt;/c&gt; TIRELESS AND PASSIONATE SUPPORT APPEARS SEND YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THANK YOU ALSO TO CO AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WALDRON CARILLO AND MAYES. I'M KERIS MYRICK AND I'M CHIEF APPEAR SERVICES OFFER LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. PREVIOUSLY I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS -- FOR THE CENTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SAM SUNG. AS WELL AS ARE BOTH ON THE NAMI CALIFORNIA AND THEN ON THE NATIONAL BOARD SERVING TWO YEARS AS THEIR PRESIDENT -- OF THE NATIONAL BOARD I PUBLISHED NUMEROUS PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES ABOUT PEER SUPPORT AND BOOK CHAPTERS ABOUT PEER SUPPORT IN THE STATE OF THE FIELD. I COULD GO ON AND ON FOR DAYS ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT BUT I WANT. I'LL JUST DO MY THREE MINUTE. BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT ME IS THAT WHEN I WAS GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA I WAS TOLD ALL THE THINGS I COULD NOT. WOULD NOT SHOULD NOT EVER DO AND THESE THINGS I HAVE SHARED ABOUT MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE OR WELL BEYOND THE IMAGINATION OF WHAT ANYBODY THOUGHT I COULD ACHIEVE EXCEPT WELL MEME MAYBE MY PARENTS. THOUGHT I COULD DO IT AS WELL AS VERY INNOVATIVE TREATMENT TEAM THINKS THE ONLY DIEM H. -- AND ALSO -- TO MY PEERS THE FIRST HERE I MEANT WAS ACTUALLY -- AND AT THE AGE OF FORTY AND IT WAS SOMEONE WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE ME A LITTLE BIT OLDER. BASICALLY -- LIKE ME AND THAT'S WHEN I FINALLY GOT IT THAT RECOVERY IS INDEED POSSIBLE. I'M AND SHE HELPED ME TO HELP MYSELF THE OUTCOMES THAT WE ACHIEVE -- ARE THE VERY ONES THAT REQUIRE PEOPLE IN DISTRESS TO BE MET WHERE THEY ARE TO BE HEARD AND TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT TO PARTNER WITH THEM. WHILE IT SAM SO WE PROVIDE A TA TO STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA TO ADVANCE THE PIER WORKFORCE. INFO PRIESTESS DESCRIBE -- OUTCOMES THAT PEERS CAN ACHIEVE AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO -- HELPING PEOPLE GAIN SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE AND PARTICIPATING IN TREATMENT AND AND SUPPORT IN USING SHARED DECISION MAKING. INCREASING SELF ADVOCACY FOR PARENTS REDUCING STIGMA FOR PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OF AND REDUCING SHAME AND BLAME AND ALSO REDUCING HOSPITALIZATION WHILE INCREASING. THE COMMUNITY. SO WE CAN ACHIEVE THESE OUTCOMES ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT CONSISTENCY AND TRAINING THAT'S BASED ON A COMMON SET OF CORE COMPETENCIES PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND ETHICS. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PROFESSION AND A RIGHT YEAH THOSE OTHER FORTY EIGHT STATES THAT ALREADY HAVE IT. SO THIS HOPE THIS BILL WILL HELP US HELP THIS STATE TO HELP THOSE IN NEED WE WANT TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON THE EVERYDAY HEADLINES THAT WE SEE AROUND HOMELESSNESS. LACK OF TIMELY ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE SERVICES AND DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF SUICIDE PEER SERVICES SAVES LIVES WE NEED TO TAKE OUR PLACE ALONGSIDE OTHERS IN THIS STATE PROVIDING SERVICES AND BEING REIMBURSED BY MEDICAID. TO DO EXACTLY THAT HELP SAVE LIVES AND I'LL END BY SAYING ON JULY FIFTH IT IS MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY HOWEVER MY MOTHER'S LONG LONGER WITH US SHE NEVER GOT TO SEE ME GET BETTER. SHE NEVER GOT TO SEE ME LIVE INDEPENDENTLY SHE NEVER SAW ME GO BACK TO WORK AND SO THIS YEAR I'VE DEDICATED ALL OF EVERYTHING THAT I DO TO HER BECAUSE SHE ALSO HELPED OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL. AS A FAMILY SUPPORTER SO I ALSO DEDICATE THIS TO ALL OF OUR PEERS WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SAVED AND LOST -- BUT MANY PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES TO EARLY AND TO THE FAMILIES THAT MORE IN THEM. SO I REALLY ASK -- TWO YEAR FOR IT I VOTE TO ADVANCE OUR PEER WORKFORCE SUCH THAT WE CAN INCREASE OUR ABILITIES AND CALIFORNIA'S MOVEMENT TO TRANSFORM THE MENTAL HEALTH.

IT WAS THOUGHT THAT WE LOST EVERYTHING. BUT LATER EXAMINATION SHOWED THAT THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHEN COULD BE. REHABILITATED. AND IT WAS IT'S BEEN DETERMINED THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT. AND THIS BILL HELPS FACILITATE. THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RUN BY THAT VANISHED. IT COULD BE FUNCTIONING AS I SAID WITHIN A FEW MONTHS BUT WE DO NEED TO HAVE THE BILL. THE BILL IS LIMITED IN SCOPE. PROVIDES ONLY. FOR THE E. R.. AT FOR THE RIVER. IT HAS GOT TO THE INSTITUTIONS ASKED TO COMPLY WITH NURSE PATIENT STAFFING RATIOS. PROVIDE CLINICAL AND LABORATORY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WITNESSES SUPPORT THIS THAT SHORT OF A HALF OF ADVENTIST HEALTH WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR -- AND THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL AND AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- I HAVE BEEN OFFERED THE US PEDESTAL REPORTING REQUIRES YOU THINK WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ISOLATE ON THIS PROGRAM -- IN OUR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO WE WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT WE AS THE SENATOR SAID WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CAMPFIRE HAS CREATED A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION -- AND IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING TO THIS COMMUNITY I'M I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE FOR CROSSING WITH ADVENTIST HEALTH YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL WOULD MEAN FOR THAT COMMUNITY. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- IN SHERMAN WOOD. I AM RICK ROSSIN THE PRESIDENT OF EVIDENCE HEALTH AND RIGHT OUT WHICH INCLUDES SEVEN THIS HEALTH OPERATIONS AND BUTTE COUNTY. PARTICULARLY FOR THE RIVER HOSPITAL IN PARADISE. HAVE BEEN A SELF INCLUDES SEVENTEEN HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA THE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOSPITAL BASED RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO RURAL HEALTH CARE ANSWER SOME OF OUR STATES MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. FEATHER RIVER HOSPITAL IN PARADISE CALIFORNIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT COMMITMENT. BEFORE LAST FALL'S CAMPFIRE IT WAS A ONE HUNDRED BED THRIVING ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL THE HAVE BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY FOR NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS. THE HOSPITAL SERVED A RURAL COMMUNITY WITH MORE THAN 80% OF OUR PATIENTS COVERED BY MEDICARE AL OR MEDICARE. MANY WITH SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES AND TRAVELING DISTANCES FOR THE CARE THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED. WE EMPLOYED MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. LIKE MOST OF THE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE OUR HOSPITAL SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES DURING THE CAMP FIRE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE ACUTE CARE FACILITY RECEIVE SUCH DAMAGE HAS TO BE AN OPERABLE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS NEWER CONSTRUCTION AND HAVE SUSTAINED ONLY LIMITED DAMAGE. OUR COMMUNITY WHILE DEVASTATED CONTINUES TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS. PRIOR TO THE FIRE THE FEATHER RIVER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SAW APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PATIENTS PER DAY. MANY OF THE AREA HOSPITALS HAVE SEEN LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS SINCE THE CAMP FIRE WHICH IS IMPACTED ACCESS TO CARE ACROSS THE REGION. PEOPLE FROM NEARBY TOWNS ARE NOW TRAVELING AS LONG AS AN HOUR TO REACH AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AND FACING LONG WAITS ONCE THEY ARRIVE. IN ADDITION LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ESTIMATING THAT A MINIMUM OF TWO THOUSAND UTILITY AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE COMING TO WORK. IN PARADISE EACH DAY WORKING IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK THESE WORKERS ARE MORE AT RISK FOR INJURY REQUIRING EMERGENCY CARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF PARADISE MAKE ALIYAH AND OTHER NEARBY COMMUNITIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES RESTORED IN PARADISE. WE APPRECIATE THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR REQUEST. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE AN EXCEPTIONALLY UNIQUE SITUATION. WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHICH OF OUR NEIGHBORS WILL BE COMING BACK. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN AND WHERE BUILDING OR REBUILDING WILL OCCUR. AND WE WON'T FOR AWHILE. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW OUR COMMUNITY IS IN DESPERATE NEED. FOR THE CARE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WILL PROVIDE NEEDED CARE THE OTHER TYPES OF CLINIC FACILITIES KING CANNOT INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN EMERGENCY CARE AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. PROVIDED BY HIGHLY SKILLED AND VALUED EMERGENCY SERVICES -- PROFESSIONAL STAFF. WHEN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PAID PATIENTS NEED A HIGHLY HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE WHAT STABILIZE WE ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE HELIPAD THE CAN HANDLE ALL EMERGENT TRANSPORTS? HELICOPTER SERVICES CAN GET A PATIENT TO A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS INCLUDING RIGHT OUT HOSPITAL WHICH IS PART OF OUR SYSTEM. IN TWENTY MINUTES INTO AND LOW MEDICAL CENTER IN LESS THAN. TEN DURING THE TRANSPORT PATIENTS WILL BE UNDER THE CONSTANT CARE OF TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY SIX WHILE WILL ALLOW EVAN THIS HELP THE RESTORE ROLE EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO OUR COMMUNITY WHILE CONTINUING TO ASSESS WHAT THE COMMUNITIES MEDICAL NEEDS ARE AS OUR COUNTY REBUILDS.

LOST PRODUCTIVITY DUE TO ALCOHOL RELATED ILLNESSES. HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES CRIME AND OTHER SOCIAL COSTS. MORE CLOSE TO HOME IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ABOUT 90% OF CALIFORNIANS REPORTED EITHER BINGE DRINKING OR CHRONIC DRINKING. SB FIVE NINETY PROVIDES ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO TRY TO HELP THOSE WHO SUFFER WITH CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM. THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY AMENDS THE LANTERN MEN PETR SHORT ACT TO INCLUDE THOSE SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM IN THE EXISTING SCREENING PROCESS. THIS INCLUSION WITH THEIR FALL OUT ANY PERSON. INCLUDING A PARENT OR A SIBLING OR A SPOUSE TO PETITION. A COUNTY DESIGNATED ENTITY. TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL OR A LOVED ONE WHO IS SUFFERING WITH CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM. A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS OR IS GRAVELY DISABLED TO BE SCREENED AND ASSESSED. THIS EVALUATION WITH US INITIATE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY INTENSIVE TREATMENT OR CONSERVATORSHIP IF NECESSARY.

IT WAS JUST PURE VODKA AND SHE WAS A FUNCTIONING ALCOHOLIC IN A SCHOOL TEACHER [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY ALCOHOLISM AND THE ABUSE OF AMPHETAMINES WRITTEN BY HER DOCTOR -- ENDED UP COSTING HER LIFE AT FIFTY SEVEN YEARS OLD. SO IT'S IT WE NEED TO PROVIDE TOOLS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS THAT DO RECOGNIZE THAT. ALCOHOL ABUSE IS A PROBLEM ABOUT BLESS YOU. AND IT ALLOWS JUST ONE MORE TOOL FOR US TO GET AN EVALUATION OF THOSE THAT WE WE LOVE AND I'M BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IN HONOR OF MY AND RICKY AND HOPE THAT YOU'LL SUPPORT BUT WHEN I VOTE.

THREE FORTY SEVEN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR [inaudible] IN MEMBERS. UP BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TEN OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH WILL CLARIFY THE BILL'S LABELING PROVISIONS. DO NOT APPLY TO UNSEAL BEVERAGES WERE THE PURCHASER OR SELLER CAN ADD SUGAR AT THE POINT OF SALE. SUCH AS AT A COFFEE SHOP. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. THREE FORTY SEVEN IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF A BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN THAT SEEKS TO LIMIT THE HEART HELP HARMFUL HEALTH IMPACTS. THAT SUGARY BEVERAGES CONTINUE TO HAVE ON THE HEALTH IN HAPPY IS HAPPINESS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. SKYROCKETING RATES OF OBESITY AND PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES CONTINUE TO WREAK HAVOC ON THE HEALTH OF FAMILIES IN ALL OVER DISTRICTS. IN BURDEN OUR STATE WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HEALTHCARE COSTS RELATED TO THE TREATMENT. OF THESE PREVENTABLE CHRONIC DISEASES. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN WILL EMPOWER CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE BEVERAGES THEY PURCHASE. BY REQUIRING A SCIENCE BASED HEALTH WARNING LABEL TO BE PLACED ON SUGAR SWEETENED DRINKS THAT ARE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THE CONTAINS SEVENTY FIVE CALORIES OR MORE. OF ADDED SUGAR PER TWELVE FLUID OUNCES. MEMBERS HEALTH WARNING LABELS ARE PROVEN AND EFFECTIVE MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY ON TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL PRODUCTS FOR DECADES. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN WILL PROMOTE INFORM TO CONSUMER CHOICE IN A LEAD TO BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL DOES NOT REMOVE DRINKS FROM THE SHELVES IT IS NOT TAX THEM. IN AT NO WAY PREVENTS CONSUMERS FROM BUYING WHAT THEY WANT. IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THEM WITH SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION ABOUT THE SEVERE HEALTH IMPACTS OF SUGARY DRINK CONSUMPTION. IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IS ARGUED THAT SODA TAXES AND PORTION CONTROL LEGISLATION UNFAIRLY IMPACT THEIR INDUSTRY. AND CONSUMERS AND INSTEAD CLAIMED THAT EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT HEALTHFUL CHOICES IS THE BETTER PATH FORWARD. I AGREE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT EDUCATES CONSUMERS. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY SEVEN ALLOWS A CONSUMER TO LOOK AT A STORE SHELF AND IDENTIFY WHICH CAMOUFLAGED PRODUCTS. CONTAIN ADDED SUGAR. IN WHICH PRODUCTS ARE MORE HELPFUL. CONSUMERS ARE FREE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS AND ARE AIDED ONLY BY THE ADDITIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. MEMBERS ONE IN THREE CHILDREN IN YOUR DISTRICTS. BORN AFTER THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND IS PREDICTED TO DEVELOP DIABETES IN THEIR LIFETIME. IN THAT NUMBER JUMPS TO ONE INTO FOR LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN. ASKS THAT YOU JOIN ME TODAY. IN THE ENTIRE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY. IN TAKING A BOLD STEP. TOWARD PREVENTING THE STATISTIC FROM COMING TRUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS AT THIS TIME THROUGH THE CHAIR LIKE TO PRESENT. OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT STARTING WITH DOCTOR CO FOR THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR FLOWS ON CO FOR AND I AM THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF POLICY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. TOGETHER WITH THE CONFERENCE CALIFORNIA BLACK HEALTH NETWORK THE LATINO COALITION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR SB THREE FORTY SEVEN TO PLACE WARNING LABELS ON SUGARY DRINKS. THE SCIENCE ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN SUGARY DRINKS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IS INCONTROVERTIBLE SO OPPOSITION IS CENTER THEIR PLATFORM AROUND SEVERAL THE SEVERAL EASILY REPEATABLE ARGUMENTS WHICH I WILL. ARGUMENT NUMBER ONE IS THAT WARNING LABEL SIMPLY DON'T WORK. AND SIMPLY STATED THIS IS FALSE ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE PEDIATRICS IN JOURNAL IN FEBRUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN WARNING LABELS ARE THREE TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRIES CLEARING CALORIE LABELS. IN HELPING PARENTS CHOOSE A DRINK WITHOUT ADDED SUGAR. THESE PARENTS WERE ALSO MORE AWARE OF THE STARTLING FACT THAT CONSUMING JUST ONE SUGARY DRINK PER DAY INCREASE THEIR RISK OF CAVITIES TO FOLD DIABETES BY 26% AND OBESITYBY 55%. AND THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT SODA WARNING LABELS HELP CONSUMERS DISTINGUISH GREEN PRODUCTS LIKE FLAVORED DRINKS WITH ADDED SUGAR WHICH ARE OFTEN OTHERWISE INDISTINGUISHABLE. FOR THIS REASON THREE QUARTERS OF CALIFORNIA VOTER SUPPORT WARNING LABELS WITH EVEN HIGHER SUPPORT AMONG BLACK AND LATINO RESIDENTS. ARGUMENT NUMBER TWO IS THAT WARNING LABELS KILL JOBS THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE COST OF PRODUCTS TO RESTRICT THEIR SALES IN ANYWAY. BUT NO LEGISLATION WILL STOP PEOPLE FROM BEING THIRSTY THAT'S JUST HOW OUR BODIES WORK DATA FROM BERKELEY SHOW THAT AFTER THEIR TAX WAS ENACTED NO JOBS WERE LOST BECAUSE PEOPLE STILL BUY DRINKS THEY JUST BOUGHT. LOWER CALORIE DRINKS THE SAME PATTERN CAN BE EXPECTED HERE. ARGUMENT NUMBER THREE IS THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO WARNING LABELS OVERTURNED THE PANEL DID IT DID. RULE AGAINST THE SAN FRANCISCO WARNING LABEL BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THE 20% FIVE REQUIREMENT WAS LARGER THAN NECESSARY. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE RULING AND THE JUDGE'S OPINION IN THAT IT DOES NOT SPECIFY A MINIMUM SIZE OF THE LABEL ONLY MINIMUM FONT SIZE FOR LEGIBILITY. AND THAT IT USES THE JUDGES RECOMMENDED PHRASES OF TYPE TWO DIABETES AND MAY CONTRIBUTE. AND THE LAST ARGUMENT NUMBER FOUR THE FDA SAY SUGARY SAFE. THE FTC SUGAR SAFE EXCEPT WHEN CONSUMING EXCESS AMOUNTS AND SB THREE FORTY SEVEN TARGETS HIGH CALORIE DRINKS THOSE WITH SUGAR ADDED SUGAR AND MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE CALORIES PER TWELVE OUNCE. THE EXCESS AMOUNTS THERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF DISEASE. OUR OPPOSITION THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIBER CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION HAVE STATED THAT WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS AND EMPOWER THEM TO MAKE CHOICES THAT ARE BEST FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN IS THE POLICY ANSWER TO THIS PLATITUDE GIVE CONSUMERS THE INFORMATION SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT WHAT TO DRINK. THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT WHOSE VALUES WE LOSE INTEREST WE VALUEMOST. CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION THEY WANT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION AND THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T HAVE A FACTUAL OR CONSISTENT ARGUMENT AGAINST APPLYING THIS INFORMATION. FOR THESE REASONS I ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO MY NAME IS MARLENE ON THE LAW I AM A GRADUATING SENIOR FROM ROLES OF ALL HIGH SCHOOL IN BOYLE HEIGHTS. SENATE BILL THREE HUNDREDFORTY SEVEN IMPACTSME BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY IN THE OIL HEIGHTS AREA AND IN HIS LOS ANGELES AND OTHER LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WITHIN. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAVE BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH SUGAR WITHOUT KNOWING IT HOW MUCH SHOULD WE DRINK DOES HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IN MY COMMUNITY EAST LA HAS. THE HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES AND LOS ANGELES -- AMONG STUDENTS ONE OUT OF THREE HAVE. PRE DIABETES THERE IS ALSO A HIGH PREVALENCE OF OBESITY AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE BUT DIABETES OBESITY AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AREN'T. ONLY BECAUSE BECAUSE OF STURBRIDGE DRINKS BUT CONSUMING THESE FREQUENTLY INCREASES THE RISK OF HAVING THESE RISKS. MANY FAMILY LIVE WHERE HIGHS SUFFERED THROUGH A CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND I BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THESE OUTCOMES. OVERALL THOUGH LET THAT'S A NICE COMMUNITY ALSO FACES THESE CHALLENGES. AND BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THEIR REGULAR. OF LIKE. DALY. DAILY DIET OF CONSUMING THESE COVERAGES AND NOT HAVING THE HEALTHY BEVERAGES OPTIONS THE HIGH NUMBER OF HELLO. NIGHT COME CONVENIENCE STORES MAKE DEALS STRENGTH EASY AND CHEAP TWO AXES AND WITHOUT LABELS MANY OF US DON'T THINK THAT. THESE STRINGS ARE HOME FOR FOR US -- IN FACT WE ALL TEND TO SAY THAT. COKE IS A CURE ALL SO FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE SAY'S THAT THEY'RE NOT FEELING WELL WE SAY -- DRINK THE COKE YOUR STOMACH HURTS DRINK A COKE. LE. FOR THOSE WHO WHO KNOWN AS SODA ISN'T GOOD. WE WANT TO GET THESE DIFFERENT CHOICES BUT IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN WE DO NOT KNOW HOW. TO DIFFERENTIATE NAY BE HEALTHY DRINKS FROM THE THE SUGARY DRINKS. SO I BELIEVE ADDING. A HEALTH WARNING LABEL ENTRE WEIRD DRINKS WILL ALWAYS. THE HELP EVERYONE TO TELL WHETHER. THOSE DRINKS HAVE A LOT OF ADDED SUGAR OR WHETHER THEY DO NOT -- IT WILL ALSO HELP [inaudible] MANY PEOPLE. TO TO THINK OF OF THE NIGHT THE ONE TIME PER DAY HOW IT AFFECTS US. AND IN FIVE LAKE. I KNOW THAT FOR WOMEN WE CAN ONLY DREAM ABOUT LIKE TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TEASPOONS I BELIEVE ON A TRIP FOR THE BUT ONE CANDIDATE IS MORE. THAN WHAT A WOMAN SHOULD HAVE TO DRINK WELL I AM HERE BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW THAT. THESE RISK. TO HAVE. A LOT OF SIGN. WELL PEOPLE HAVE THE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THAT. SUGARY DRINKS ARE HARMFUL AND THEY AFFECT OUR HOUSE AND EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO LIVE FREE OF PREVENTABLE DISEASE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO PROMOTE THE AWARENESS ON ON HEALTHY BEVERAGES AND TO TO PUT THOSE LABELS ON SUGARY DRINKS. FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE AND NOT SUFFER FROM THESE DISEASES THAT THEY MIGHT FACE LATER ON IN LIFE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

RONALD COLMAN ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIRTY ONE IN OPPOSITION YOUR SHERMAN MEMBERS JOHN LATTIMER ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND PEPSICO. OUR MEMBERS SELL HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT BEVERAGES TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THOSE BEVERAGES ARE FULL CALORIE WITH ADDED SUGAR SOME LOW CALORIE WITH ADDED SUGAR SOME NO CALORIE NO ADDED SUGAR. THE POINT BEING WE ARE GIVING CONSUMERS A FULL RANGE OF BEVERAGE CHOICES. THE MANUFACTURERS AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW BUT THE CLERK INFORMATION EACH CONTAINER TO BE MORE EVIDENT TO CONSUMERS. THE KILLER WORK IN A CONTACT. THE POINT BEING CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING. THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL ARGUE THAT CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES PRESENTS A UNIQUE DRIVER TO THE OBESITY AND DIABETES CRISIS. SO MUCH SO THAT ONLY THESE SUGAR SWEETENED PRODUCTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WARNING LABEL. UNFORTUNATELY THAT POSITION DOES NOT ALIGNED WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. RESEARCH BY THE CDC SHOWS THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS CONSUMPTION FROM SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY. 26% FOR ADULTS AND 36% FOR YOUTH. YEAH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH BY CDC SENT NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS REPORTS THAT OBESITY RATES DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME REXI RISING. CLEARLY SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION CAN'T BE BOTH FALLING AND AT THE SAME TIME BE THE LEADING DRIVER OF THE INCREASE IN OBESITY THAT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP. SO WHAT ARE CONSUMERS DRINKING ACTUALLY TODAY TODAY OF ALL BEVERAGES PURCHASED 50% OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY CONTAIN ZERO SUGAR AND THAT NUMBER IS ON THE RISE. CONSUMERS ARE MAKING THIS CHOICE FOR THEMSELVES. THE PROPONENTS ALSO RAISE THIS IS THE SPECTER OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES BEING THE LARGEST SOURCE OF QUOTE ADDED SUGARS IN THE AMERICAN DIET. THE CHALLENGE OF THE DATA POINT IS IT CAN SOUND MISLEADING. THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE TRACKS CONSUMPTION OF CALORIES FROM FOOD PRODUCTS IN THE US DIET AND BREAKS IT DOWN INTO SEVEN DISTINCT CATEGORIES. FOODS AND BEVERAGES CONTAINING ADDED SUGARS IS ONE OF THOSE DISTINCT CATEGORIES. AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE LARGEST SOURCE OF CALORIES IN OUR DIET IT'S NOT THE LARGEST OF THOSE CATEGORIES. IN FACT THESE FOODS AND BEVERAGES ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST CATEGORY REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE CALORIES IN THE AMERICAN DIET. SO WHILE WE MAY DISAGREE WITH THE CHARACTERIZATIONS SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ADDED SUGARS IN THE AMERICAN DIET. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT NUMBER IF IT'S A CORRECT NUMBER WHICH WE DISPUTE IS STILL 8% OF THE TOTAL CALORIES. IN THE DIET CONSUMED AND THAT NUMBER AGAIN IS DROPPING. SO WILL NOT ALL INSIGNIFICANT THE SOURCE OF ADDED SUGAR AND CALORIES CANNOT BE THE DRIVER OF THE MUCH LARGER PROBLEM. THAT IS OUR FRUSTRATION THIS MUCH LARGER PROBLEM OF OBESITY AND DIABETES AND THEREFORE DOES NOT WARRANT THE ONLY STATE SANCTIONED WARNING LABEL WITH THAT PASSED FOR NOTEBOOK. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE MANY MISTRAL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS IN TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION A CMC IS OPPOSED TO SB THREE FORTY SEVEN IT IS ONE OF THE BILLS THE SESSION -- THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS A MANUFACTURING BREAKER I LEGISLATION THAT IS EARNED THAT DISTINCTION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A POLICY THAT WILL NOT JUST HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MANUFACTURERS BUT WILL IMMEDIATELY INDUCTOR MENTALLY ALTER CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS. PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS IN A WAY THAT WILL COST US REVENUE JOBS IN OUR ABILITY TO COPE EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE SB THREE FORTY SEVEN DOES ALL THESE THINGS -- IT'S CALIFORNIA ONLY WARNING LABEL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURING JOBS CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER ONE HUNDRED MANUFACTURERS THAT BOTTLE IN PACKAGE BEVERAGES MANY ARE SMALL INDEPENDENT MEDIA. SMALL AND MEDIUM INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT COMPETE FOR CONTRACTS A BOTTLE MANY PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE BEVERAGE COMPANIES ONE FACILITY MAY SERVE MANY DIFFERENT COMPANIES THEY THRIVE WHEN THEY CAN OPERATE AS HUBS FOR MULTI STATE AND MULTINATIONAL PRODUCTION. SB THREE FORTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA ONLY WARNING LABEL PULLS THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEM CHANGING THE ECONOMICS OF ITS OF DRINK PRODUCTION AND ENCOURAGING THEIR CLIENTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE REGIONAL OPERATIONS. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. LIKEWISE SB TWO FORTY SEVEN ENCOURAGES THOSE POTENTIAL CLIENTS THAT MAYBE SMALL EMERGING BEVERAGE COMPANIES TO BEGIN THE PRODUCTION OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. A CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LEADS THE NATION ANY SORT OF START UP MANUFACTURERS BUT SB THREE FORTY SEVEN REPRESENTS AN ADDITIONAL COST PLEASE CASH STRAPPED COMPANIES PUSHING THEM TOWARDS GROWING THERE COME THEIR OPERATIONS. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA IN A STATE WHERE ONE FACILITY CAN PRODUCE A LABEL FOR A PRODUCT THAT CAN ENTER DOZENS OF MARKETS SO TO BE CLEAR SB THREE FORTY SEVEN WILL SLOW DOWN THE PRODUCTION THAT'S OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF WELL PAYING SOMETIMES SIX FIGURES MIDDLE CLASS OFTEN UNION BETH -- ORGANIZE JOBS WITH BENEFITS. I KNOW THE TYPE OF JOBS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE RE WHY YOU MAY NOT SEE JOB LOSS IN A SINGLE CITY -- IS BECAUSE THE PRODUCTS BEING SOLD IN THAT CITY WERE MADE OUTSIDE OF IT -- APPLYING THIS SCHEME TO THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PUSHES PRODUCTION OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIANS WITH THEIR JOBS CREATED. THEY'LL BE OUTSIDE OF OUR STATE -- ANDTHEIR MANY TAP CALIFORNIA TOWNS I CAN TELL YOU THE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES HEALTH WHEN THESE TYPE OF JOBS GO AWAY. SO SB THREE FORTY SEVEN WE'RE WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE BENEFITS ARE QUESTIONABLE AND DO NOT WAY OUT WAY THESE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS SB THREE FORTY SEVEN MAY POTENTIALLY MISLEAD CONSUMERS INTO THINKING THAT A DRINK WITH LESS SUGAR. IS MORE HARMFUL THAN A DRINK FOOD OR CANDY WITH TWO OR THREE TIMES AS MUCH SUGAR IT CREATES MORE CONFUSION IN THE UNIVERSAL STANDARD THAT CURRENTLY EXIST AND FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE. ENERGY TO OPPOSE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR SECURE MEMBERS MET CERTAIN OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL LARGE BUT WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE RESTAURANT OBLIGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE BILL THANK YOU.

THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SONORA BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR THE DIRECT MY COMMENTS TO MY FELLOW ROUGHRIDER AMMA PROUD ALUMNI ROSA HIGH SCHOOL AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR COMING UP TO SACRAMENTO TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. BEFORE I LOSE MY VOICE I JUST WANTED TO SAY YOUR ADVOCACY IS IMPORTANT AND DESPITE WHAT HAPPENS WHETHER THIS BILL GETS OUT OR GETS ON THE FLOOR. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE HERE AND THEY CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY THE RISE IN DIABETES HEALTH CONCERNS ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE LATINO POPULATION EAST LA. AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. MCCARTY. GET THANK YOU -- MISTER MISTER CHAIR SO I I I SUPPORT THIS BILL I SUPPORT A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- MY PROPS DOING VERY WELL UP THERE -- CENTER MINING AND I THINK YOU'RE TAKING IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL BUT BUT IN ALL SERIOUSLY WHY WE'RE HERE IS BECAUSE THE CONSUMER HAS NO IDEA. AND SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY IT'S IT WILL BE A WORTHLESS MORNING IN THE CALORIES ARE ON FRONT I CONCUR THAT THERE'S MORE INFORMATION. ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE. AS OPPOSED THE BACKED IN YEARS PAST BUT I DON'T THINK THE AVERAGE CONSUMER MOM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; DAD&lt;/c&gt; FAMILY MEMBER. KNOWS WHEN THEY BUY A TWENTY OUNCE. BOTTLE OF COCA COLA THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT. SUGAR AND DIVIDE BY I THINK IT'S THREE POINT NINE AND REALIZE THAT THAT. HAS SIXTEEN TEASPOONS OF SUGAR. AND IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THEIR ICE TEA IF THEY PUT. ONE TEASPOON IN. THIRTY TWO THREE AFTER SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN DO THINK YOU KNOW WHAT. LITTLE TOO MUCH. SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN PROBABLY TOO MUCH. AND I THINK THAT THE CONSUMER DOESN'T NOW AND AND I WOULD I WOULD PREFER NOT JUST. A WARNING AS FAR AS THE GENERIC WARNING BUT HAVE ACTUAL TEASPOONS OF SUGAR BECAUSE THE GRAMS OF SUGAR. YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE DON'T GET THE LONG DIVISION MATH AND FIGURING OUT ON THE FLY. SO -- YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE AND LOOK THERE'S NO PERFECT SCIENCE IT SHOWS THAT THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE EMPTY CALORIES THAT PEOPLE ARE UTILIZING THESE DAYS I MEAN CHOCOLATE CAKE IS ONE THING HAMBURGERS. BUT THOSE AT LEAST HAVE SOME NUTRITIONAL VALUE. THESE DRINKS ESPECIALLY THAT SUGAR SWEET ONES -- HAVE HAVE ZERO NUTRITIONAL VALUE. IN THE INDUSTRY THAT THEY ARE JUST TAKING THE RIGHT STEP CONSUMERS ARE VOTING WITH THEIR FEET IN THEIR POCKET BOOK IN. THE INDUSTRY IS PROBABLY MAKING JUST AS MUCH OR MORE MONEY OFF THE OTHER DRINKS THE KNEES AND SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BY NOT SELLING AS MANY OF OF THIS DRINK WE HAVE BEFORE US. AND YOU KNOW I I I I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE BIG HARM AS OF THIS AND I I I DON'T QUITE GET HOW? IT'S A JOB KILLER IT'S INFORMATION PEOPLE ARE STILL MANUFACTURE PRODUCE THIS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY SELL IT. WHERE THE FOURTH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND I'M GONNA GO AWAY THE SOUL TO SELL THEIR PRODUCT WITH THIS LABEL? OR Nó LABEL -- AND I I JUST -- I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TOUGH FIGHT. IS BIG BUSINESS AND BIG INDUSTRY -- BEHIND THIS -- JUST LIKE WE FACE IN THE TOBACCO FIGHTS IS IS A BIG BIG DEAL IN OUR SOCIETY SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR STICKING OUT IT -- I DO HAVE JUST TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE OPPOSITION AND I'M KIND OF CONFUSED SO I UNDERSTAND I KNOW MR A LOT OF YOUR YOU SAID REPRESENT BOTH THE RETAILERS AND PEPSICO SO I UNDERSTAND THE PEPSICO ARGUMENT THAT THE NOT. NOT LIKE IN THIS BUT FROM THE RETAILERS AND THE CONVENIENCE STORES WHAT'S THE THAT THE STRONG AND VERSION FROM THERE IT'S A BABY SELLING THE PRODUCT WITH A LABEL WITHOUT THE LABEL. I KNOW THERE'S SOME SOME FINDS IN THERE AS FAR AS AT AND HARASSED BUT BUT I'M TRYING. TO FOCUS ON THE NEXUS FOR THEIR STRONG OPPOSITION SURE. AND IT'S SO SIGNIFICANT SO MY RETAIL MEMBERS NEARLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ALSO HAS THEIR OWN PRIVATE LABELS THEY ALSO STOCK ACTORS MANUFACTURERS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. NOT NOT ONLY IN THE AREA OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES BUT ALMOST ANYTHING THAT WE OFFER. YOUR LOCAL GUY AND YOU GO TO BAILEY'S IN BELLAIRE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BRANDS THAT WE'RE THE MANUFACTURER IN THOSE INSTANCES -- SAME IS TRUE FOR SAFE WAY SAME IS TRUE FOR VON SO WHERE MANUFACTURERS AS WELL AS OUR READ THAT AS WE ARE RETAILERS. THE THING IS WE SELL AGAIN A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCTS WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE CONSUMERS. IS ACCURATE -- WE DON'T DISPUTE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD NOT CONSUME TOO MUCH SUGAR WHAT WE DISPUTE THE FACT IS THAT THIS PRODUCT SINGLE THE CONSUMPTION RATE WHICH IS DROPPING IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THE NEEDS TO HAVE A WARNING LABEL. IT DOES CONVEY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THIS IS THE COST PRODUCT AND SO WE DISAGREE FUNDAMENTALLY WITH THAT BOTH AS A MANUFACTURER AND AS A RETAILER. SURE I CAN AND THEN THAT'LL I AM REALLY HAS TO THINK THE LAST INTO THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT WHICH HAS. ZERO NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND AND AND THE OTHERS KATIE CHEESE BURGER AND SO FORTH IT DOES HAVE SOME. NUTRITIONAL VALUE THESE THESE THAT THESE ARE EMPTY CALORIES. SURE AGAIN YOU CAN GET IN A GREAT DEBATE ABOUT THE CALORIC VALUE OR THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE WE DON'T. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE SOFT DRINKS THOSE BEING SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES THAT ARE -- CARBONATES OFFERINGS ARE ARGUING THEIR NUTRITIONAL VALUE THIS BILL HOWEVER APPLIES TO MANY PRODUCTS INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE NUTRITIONAL VALUE THIS IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO SODA THIS IS ANY. BEVERAGE THERE ARE. PEPSICO MAKES TROPICANA JUICE. YEAH WE HAVE A PRODUCT CALLED DROPPED FIFTY WHERE WE TAKE 50% OF THE NATIONAL RECURRING SUGAR OUT WHY BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF CALORIES IN A 100% FRUIT JUICE. AND WE REPLACE THAT THAT NATURALLY OCCURRING SUGAR WITH SOME SWEETENER THAT BOOK THAT PRODUCT WOULD CARRY A WARNING LABEL ON THAT PRODUCT HAS PLENTY OF NUTRITIONAL VALUE SO AGAIN. IT'S NOT A UNIFORM APPLICATION THAT WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT -- SODA POP SURE AND I UNDERSTAND WITH THE REALLY IS FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PRODUCT LINE. BUT THE THE THE GAS STATIONS I GUESS THE ASSOCIATION IS THE FUEL CONVENES ASSOCIATION. THEY DON'T MAKE THEIR OWN PRODUCTS DO THEY DEPENDS I AGAIN I DON'T REPRESENT THEM SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO A BUT I HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THOSE THOSE -- STORES I BELIEVE PERHAPS EXTRA MILE HAS THEIR OWN I THINK SEVEN I KNOW SEVEN LEVIN AS OUR OWN BRAND IT VARIES ACROSS THE BOARD. AND IT AND THEN AS FAR AS THE THE MANUFACTURING IN THE JOB SINGLE AND AND THESE OTHER ARGUMENTS. IN AS A WHOLE I WANTED TO IF IF THROUGH THE MISTER CHAIR IF WE CAN ALLOW. THE AUTHOR -- TO I KNOW HE'S GOING TO CLOSE IN A LITTLE BIT CLICK. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR. SO I THINK THE MANUFACTURING CONCERNS ARE EXAGGERATED WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A DIVERSIFICATION OF PRODUCTS. I THINK YOU'LL FIND THAT THE DATA SHOWS A REDUCTION IN CONSUMPTION OF SODA PRODUCTS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WHAT WE CALL CAMOUFLAGE PRODUCTS SPORT T.. ENERGY DRINKS NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE HI LOADED SUGAR CONTENT BUT TO THE QUESTION ON MANUFACTURING. IF YOU LOOK AT PRODUCTS. THAT WOULD CARRY THIS LABEL. CAN TO BEVERAGES BOTTLED BEVERAGES. IF YOU GO TO THE STORE THIS WEEKEND YOU'LL SEE SOMEONE FOURTH OF JULY LABELS ON THEM. FOOTBALL SEASON YOU'LL SEE NFL PLAYERS ON THEM. CHRISTMAS TIME HOLIDAY TIME YOU'LL SEE HOLIDAY LABELS. THE INDUSTRY IS ADEPT THEY CHANGE THEIR LABELS FREQUENTLY. THIS IS NOT GOING TO PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. IN THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IF I COULD JUST ASK THE DOCTOR TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION. THAT WAS ASKED TO THE OPPOSITION. OUT OUT OUT HOW WELL DO THAT FREQUENT PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- THE THE QUESTIONING IN TERMSOF THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR THOSE DATA THAT OUR NATIONAL DON'T NECESSARILY REFLECT THE TRENDS ARE HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE PUBLISHED A STUDY WITH UCLA LAST YEAR SHOWING THAT THE SUGARY DRINK CONSUMPTION AMONG CHILDREN IS ACTUALLY INCREASING -- AND THAT KIDS AS YOUNG AS TWO OR INCREASED. I'M CONSUMING SUGARY DRINKS AND THE SUGARY DRINKS OUR DRINKS THAT ARE MASKED AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- ONES THAT PARENTS DON'T RECOGNIZE AS SUGARY DRINKS ESPECIALLY ENERGY DRINKS IS HIGH IN THEIR AND YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT -- THAT WE PASSED LEGISLATION DETERMINING THAT IN SCHOOLS -- MANY SUGARY DRINKS CAN'T BE SOLD EXCEPT ENERGY DRINKS WERE CARVE OUT AND SO WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN THOSE DRINKS BECAUSE THEY WERE LEFT BEHIND AND FORTUNATELY -- THE OTHER THING THAT THAT REALLY WASN'T MENTIONED WAS THE FACT THAT THE ONE WE WILL DOESN'T JUST FOCUS ON OBESITY THE MORNING LIVE ALSO FOCUS ON DIABETES AND CAVITIES I DON'T THINK THE OPPOSITION WOULD WOULD LEVY AN ARGUMENT THAT THEIR PRODUCTS DON'T CONTRIBUTED THOSE AND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. THAT'S LEADING TO THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF DENTAL DENTAL HEALTH -- AS WELL AS DIABETES IN THE STATE SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIABETES OR WHO ARE AT RISK FOR DIABETES 46% OF OUR STATE HAS PRE DIABETES. THAT CONSUMING ONE SUGARY DRINK A DAY IS BASICALLY SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP DIABETES -- THAT THAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO AN ALREADY RISK ALREADY HIGH RISK POPULATION AND 46% OF OUR STATE IS A MATTER THAT STATUS IN ADDITION IT DOUBLES THE RISK OF CAVITIES. SO WHAT FOCUSING ON OBESITY IS CONVENIENT BECAUSE CERTAINLY PEOPLE WHO ARE OBESE STRUGGLE LOSING WEIGHT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT SO PEOPLE MAKE CONTINUE OR MAY EVEN STOP DRINKING BUT STILL MAY NOT LOSE WEIGHT AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE'S A TIME LAG. IN CDC DATA LOOKING AT CONSUMPTION AND OBESITY WE ARE GOING TO IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN THEY DON'T HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY UP AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU STOPPED DRINKING A BEVERAGE. THAT YOUR WEIGHT SUDDENLY BECOMES NORMAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO NOT RECOGNIZING THAT OBESITY IS BUT ONE OF THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE CALLED OUT ON THE LABEL AS BEING A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THIS. THINGS THAT ARE HARMING THE HEALTH AND AS WE AS WE SHOWN THERE ARE DAY EIGHT A SHOWING THAT PARENTS WHEN THEY ARE WHEN THEY SEE A WARNING LABEL AS COMPARED TO THAT CLEAR ON CALORIES. THAT THE EVERY BEVERAGE INDUSTRY DID THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE AND MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND SO THAT'S THE DATA COMPONENT OF IT THAT IS MISSING AND IN THE ARGUMENT. THANK YOU MISTER MESS SO. I'M I'M STRUGGLING ACTUALLY THE DISK SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE -- BOTH PRO AND CON SEEMED TO TO LEAVE ME WANTING -- FOR FOR MORE -- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW FINANCED SOLELY BY THE MANUFACTURES ARGUMENT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT A SENATOR THAT THOSE LABELS. GET CHANGE ON A REGULAR BASIS -- I DO STRUGGLE AND WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION YESTERDAY -- WITH -- WHY THE LABELS WHAT WHY WE CHOOSE -- SOME PRODUCTS AND NOT. ALL THE PRODUCTS -- ONE OF THEM BEING CHOCOLATE MILK -- I SHARED WITH YOU -- LE STORY HAVE A VERY CLOSE FRIEND AND IT'S A PEDIATRIC DENTIST AND SO -- I OFTEN TIMES WE'LL SEE A MOUTH FULL OF FROM KIDS THAT ARE COMPLETELY -- CARRIES WRITTEN -- AND THREE YEARS OLD FOUR YEARS OLD. AND IT'S BECAUSE MOMS THINKING THAT -- CHOCOLATE MILK THAT HAS ORGANIC ON THE LABEL IS HEALTHY FOR THEIR KIDS JUST BECAUSE THE WAY THAT IT'S LABELED IT SAYS ORGANIC AND THEY THINK OSIS HEALTHY IT'S IT'S MILK IT'S GOT A NUTRITIONAL VALUE WHEN IN FACT. IT ISN'T HEALTHY FOR THE KIDS THE IT'S APPLE JUICE IS NOT. JUICE IS NOT HELD IS OUR NUTRITIONAL VALUE YES -- BUT IT ISN'T -- HEALTHY A FOR KIDS ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE HEALTHY BUT THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT ALL HEALTHY I THINK OF OF OF THE AMERICAN DIET MY DIET I DRINK A KNOW SUGARED SODAS. DIET COKE EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE A DIET COKE ISN'T GOING TO BE LABELED BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE THAT A DIET COKE IS HEALTHY. FOR ME BUT THIS LABEL WHAT BE ON A ON A DIET COKE BUT IT WOULD BE ON A ON A COCA COLA THAT'S THAT'S THERE. AND SO I I WONDER IF THIS IS REALLY -- WHAT WE -- IT IS THE ANSWER -- THE ONE QUESTION IF I CAN ACTUALLY TO A TO THE TO THE OPPOSITION I ASK THIS THIS QUESTION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THAT THE TAX ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES. BUT BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME I ASKED THE QUESTION WELL -- IF IT TAX ISN'T THE ANSWER BUT WHAT'S THE ANSWER WILL EDUCATION IS THE ANSWER. WHAT WHAT HOW DO WE DO EDUCATION THEN IF IT'S NOT WITH THE LABEL AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THE LABEL IN OF ITSELF AS THE BEST LABEL -- TOOK TO LIST ON ON A CAN BUT HOW DO WE EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT -- THAT THERE YOU'RE TAKING AND THAT MUCH SUGAR WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING A COKE OR OR A PEPSI -- HOW DO WE EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT THAT BANANA NOT MOM A MUFFIN AT STARBUCKS HAS A TON OF SUGAR INTO THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE EATING HOW DO WE? HOW DO WE EDUCATE IF THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER THEN THEN WHAT AT WHAT POINT DOES THE INDUSTRY WHAT WHAT IS IT THE INDUSTRY WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE? OF IT IS TO TO GET THE WORD OUT THAT PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING. TOO MUCH SUGAR -- THAT THAT IT IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON TYPE TWO DIABETES-- IT IS HAVING AN IMPACT ON TWO TWO K. -- WHAT IS THE ANSWER IF IF THE LABEL -- IS IS NOT A SOME OF OUR WORKING. JOHN LET IT RUN HAVE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OF PEPSICO -- I DO THINK. THAT THE PROBLEM THAT THAT YOU POSE. AS SOMEONE MAKE MAZES IS REAL AND IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US I DO THINK THE MOVE TOWARDS CLEAR ON CALORIES AS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO BE CLEAR WITH CONSUMERS ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE CONSUMING. IN TERMS OF CALORIC INTAKE I DO THINK THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW IT IS GOES BACK EVEN TO A MISTER MCCARTY WAS TALKING ABOUT IF WE ASKED MOST KIDS AND PROBABLY THREE ASKED ALL THE MEMBERS FROM THE DíAS WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT OUR IDEAL CALORIC INTAKE FOR EACH ONE OF US. IS. SO PART OF THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST SIMPLY THAT -- DO I KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT PRODUCT TO DO I KNOW OF THAT OF OF THAT HOW MUCH I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS LABEL DOESN'T GIVE ANY INFORMATION. CORD THAT IT JUST SIMPLY SAYS THAT THAT PRODUCT IS HARMFUL DOESN'T SAY HOW IT'S HARMFUL -- SO IT JUST SAYS IT HAS ADDED SUGARS I MEAN EVERYTHING HAS ADDED SUGARS IS HARMFUL -- I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR YOU I KNOW WHAT THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DOING THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVELY GOING FORTH IN BRINGING OUT NEW PRODUCTS. AND WE AGAIN AS I SAID BEORE WE NOW HAVE 50% OF THE PRODUCTS SOLD OUR ZERO CALORIE PRODUCTS THAT IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT CONSUMERS WANT. THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN IN MAGICALLY COMING UP WITH A PUBLIC POLICY FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT SAYS THIS IS WHY WE KNOW EVERYBODY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT BIT OF INFORMATION -- THAT'S HARD AND I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. SORRY THIS IS. LEAVING YOU WANTING BUT THIS WARNING LABEL THAT WE'RE DESCRIBING ALSO DOESN'T HAVE INFORMATION FOR THE CONSUMER JUST SIMPLY TELL THEM NOT TO TOUCH A CERTAIN PRODUCT. THERE'S NO CONTEXT FOR WHAT THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT OR HOW MUCH OF IT THAT THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT MY SUPPOSED TO HAVE TWO THOUSAND CALORIES A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF I EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT OR A LOT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE FACTORS. THAT GO INTO WHAT YOU SHOULD CONSUME OF ANY PRODUCT WITH CALORIES NOT JUST THIS PRODUCT WITH CALORIES. IS IT. CENTERED. SHOULD THIS BE DONE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- TO HAVE SOME MA'AM IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. THEY SHOULD BE DOING BACK BACK IN WASHINGTON THAT SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHAT WHY CALIFORNIA WHY SHOULD WE BE SPECIAL -- WITH THIS WELL IT'S A FAIR QUESTION WE HAVE A UNIQUE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE TRENDS OF PREVENTABLE TYPE TWO DIABETES WE'VE ALSO BEEN A PIONEER IN OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH. AREAS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WAITING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ACT WOULD BE TANTAMOUNT. TO NOT TAKING ACTION ON WHAT IS A PROVEN PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC AND IF I MIGHT JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR ADDRESS THE OTHER PART OF YOUR QUESTION DIRECTED TO THE INDUSTRY TO PLEASE YOU THANK YOU -- SO THE CHOCOLATE MILK CONSUMPTION WHICH WE DESCRIBED THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE I'M NOT HERE'S A PROPONENT OF CHOCOLATE MILK FOR CHILDREN THERE IS PROTEIN IN MILK PRODUCTS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF BEVERAGES THAT WOULD EARN THIS LABEL. HAVE NO NUTRITIONAL VALUE. IN MANY ARE DISGUISED VITAMIN WATER THAT A PARENT MIGHT BUY FOR THEIR CHILD THINKING. GREAT VITAMIN WATERING TO MAKE SURE MY CHILD HAS ALL OF HIS OR HER VITAMINS. THOSE PRODUCTS INCLUDE SUGARS TO THE LEVEL THAT WOULD EARN THE LABEL ON THE OPPONENT ARGUES THAT THE LABEL WOULD STIGMATIZE THE PRODUCT AND NOBODY WOULD BUY IT -- I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE THE RESULT AS I SAID EARLIER. THE LABEL DOESN'T RAISE THE COST IT DOESN'T REMOVE IT FROM FROM THE MARKET PLACE IT INFORMS CHOICE SOME PEOPLE. MAY INFORMED CHOICE. THEY MAY EXERCISE MORE MODERATION. THEY MAY CHOOSE ONLY TO BUY THOSE BEVERAGES FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION AS OPPOSED TO A STAPLE IN THE DIET. SO I THINK [inaudible] WE CAN. SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHAT'S COVERED WHAT'S NOT COVERED SCIENCE NOT POLITICIANS HAVE CONCLUDED. THAT THE CONSUMPTION. OF LIQUID SUGAR IS METABOLIZED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAN SUGAR THE TEEN FOOD PRODUCTS. THAT THE BODY DIGESTS ELIMINATES. THE LIQUID SUGAR. MAKES THE PANCREAS THE KIDNEYS WORK OVERTIME CONVERTS THAT SUGAR TO FAT. MESSENGER JUST ONE MORE QUESTION TO TALK ABOUT THE LABELING AND IN A SPLITTING HAIRS I THINK OF SMOOTHIES -- I THINK THERE'S I'M THINKING OF ON WALL OF BEING ONE ONE BRAND -- THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF FRUIT AND IN THEM HI NUTRITIONAL VALUE. BUT SOME OF THEM HAVE ADDED SUGARS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A LABEL AND MAYBE THERE IS ONE THAT -- THE DOESN'T HAVE ADDED SUGARS WOULDN'T HAVE THE LABEL BUT ACTUALLY COULD HAVE A HIGHER SUGAR SUGAR CONTENT. ARE WE WELL THERE IS THE LABEL IS BASED ON ADDED SUGAR -- FRUCTOSE SUGAR IT'S IT'S WHAT IS CALCULATED. IT WOULD CAPTURE THE SPORTY'S% THE ENERGY DRINKS AT CETERA. WEEK SAM DAIRY PRODUCTS AGAIN ON THE THEORY THAT DAIRY PRODUCTS HAVE NUTRITIONAL VALUE IN PROTEIN SOMEBODY ASKED WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL ARE YOU GONNA PUT THIS LABEL ON ALCOHOL OTHERS HIGH CONCENTRATIONS. OF SUGAR AND ALCOHOL YOU HAVE TO BE TWENTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA. TO BUY ALCOHOL -- WE DO KERRY LABEL WARNINGS TO PROTECT PREGNANT WOMEN. ON ALCOHOL PRODUCTS WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON A HEALTH EPIDEMIC AMONG CHILDREN. THAT MY WIFE WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH PHYSICIAN REMINDS ME WHAT USED TO BE CALLED ADULT ONSET DIABETES. IT'S NO LONGER CALLED ADULT ONSET WE'RE SEEING AND TEENAGERS AND PRETEENS. AGAIN THIS ISN'T THE SOLUTION. BUT IT'S PART OF A PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY SUPPORTED BY ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS YOU HEARD TODAY WHO REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS. EVERY DAY IN THE SCHOOLS. IN THE CLINICS -- IN IT'S A CHOICE OF THOSE CONSTITUENTS. OVER DISTRIBUTORS OF THESE PRODUCTS WHO WILL NOT GO OUT OF BUSINESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. CINNAMON I'D LIKE. TO I'M SORRY MISTER NAZARIAN I'M SORRY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LIKE I SAID I DIDN'T WANT TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS BECAUSE THIS TO ME THIS IS PRETTY CLEAR CUT. BUT LISTENING TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS WHICH WHO. VERY MUCH VALUE AND RESPECT THE INPUT THAT THEY'RE PLACING ON THIS BUT I FEEL LIKE WE ASK QUESTIONS SOMETIMES TO DISSECT AN ISSUE. WHERE WE HAVE DIRECT CORRELATION OF WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ON IS? FROM THE DOCTOR MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND CAN YOU PLEASE. EXPLAINED THE CORRELATION OF THE STRINGS WITH THE IMPACT THEY'RE HAVING ON DIABETES AND CAN YOU PLEASE PUT NUMBERS AGAIN. VERY BRIEFLY. BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT CORRELATION WE CAN DISSECT THE ISSUES WE CAN ASK WHY. SOMETHINGS ARE NOT INCLUDED WHY OTHER THINGS ARE INCLUDED BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE START FROM ONE PLACE. AND WE WORK TO EXPAND FROM THERE RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE BILL WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THIS ISSUE IS IMPACTING SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. DISPROPORTIONATELY. AND SO I WANT TO HEAR THE NUMBERS. IF YOU I'M HAPPY TO RATTLE OFF FOR YOU AS WELL BUT IF YOU LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND THE FIRST SAY THE DIRECT CORRELATION. OF WHY WE'RE DOING THIS AND THE NUMBERS THAT IT IMPACTS ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO SO TO BE VERY CLEAR WE ARE IN A STATE WHERE 46% OF THE POPULATION HAS PRE DIABETES OKAY AND ANOTHER 9% HAS DIABETES SO EITHER HAS DIABETES OR IS IN THE PIPELINE AND SO CONSUMING ONE SUGARY DRINK A DAY INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING CAVITIES BY OF HAVING CAVITIES. ONE SUGARY DRINK A DAY AMONG CHILDREN INCREASES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF BEING OBESE BY 55%. ONE SUGARY DRINK PER DAY INCREASES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF DIABETES BY 26% AND IN ADULTS LIKELIHOOD OF DIABETES BY 27%. THOSE ARE THE DATA THAT WE HAVE SO IT ISN'T WHAT WE FOCUS ON SURE THEIR SUGAR AND LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN HAVE A BROADER CONVERSATION. THESE ARE THE THINGS WE HAVE A SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO SHOW THE LINK BETWEEN SUGARY DRINKS AND THE HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT ARE INCLUDED ON THE LABEL. DO YOU WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND. THANK YOU DO YOU WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS. AFRICAN AMERICAN HISPANIC. OF OF THE COMMUNITIES. WHOEVER ELSE YOU WANT INCLUDING YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN ABSOLUTELY SO ONE OF THE THE THINGS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WITHIN CALIFORNIA -- MEMBERS OF OUR OUR FIRST NATION ARE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES ARE BLACK COMMUNITIES IN A LATINO COMMUNITIES HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF DIABETES -- AND THAT FOR CHILDREN BORN SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND ONE IN TWO BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN ARE SLATED TO DEVELOP DIABETES IN THEIR LIFETIME THAT'S 50% OF BOTH OF THOSE POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BORN BETTER. AGE NINETEEN AND UNDER RIGHT NOW ARE SLATED TO DEVELOP DIABETES WHEN THE WORD EPIDEMIC IS THROWN AROUND SO OFTEN AND I'M AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST BY TRAINING AND SO I'M REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT USING THAT WORD. WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT ONE IN TWO CHILDREN BORN AFTER A CERTAIN AGE BASICALLY EVERYONE NINETEEN AND UNDER -- THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF AN EPIDEMIC -- YOU COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT IN ANY OTHER WAY THAT IT THAT MEANS THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY WE THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW WELLNESS WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY -- THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT HAMPERING OF THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GROW UP AND BE HEALTHY ADULTS SORRY SAY THAT AGAIN. WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF AN EPIDEMIC AND WHAT THRESHOLD MUST THAT PASS SO TYPICALLY WE START TALKING ABOUT EPIDEMICS WHEN AT LEAST 15% OF THE POPULATION IS AFFECTED. AND WHERE ARE WE NOW WITH THIS WE ARE AT ONE INTO BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN BORN AFTER THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WILL LIKELY DEVELOP DIABETES. SO TO THE OPPOSITION. WITH THERE WAS THIS WAS BEFORE MY TIME HERE BUT THERE WAS SO MANY ISSUES AND CONCERNS ABOUT. OF FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS PROVIDING CALORIC INTAKE NUMBERS -- I I DON'T EVEN KNOW MAYBE YOU WORKED ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES -- AT I DON'T WANT TO ASSUME. THERE WAS SO MUCH CONSTERNATION OVER THAT ISSUE THERE WAS SO MANY ATTEMPTS BUT THEN ULTIMATELY IT PASSED. AND IT'S BEEN WORKING GREAT. NEVER IN MY LIFETIME THAT I THINK MCDONALD'S WOULD BE OFFERING SALADS. IT IS. MAYBE IT HAD SOME VERSION OF A SALAD IN THE PAST AS WELL BUT THERE HAS BEEN A TREND THAT'S HELPED PUSH SO WHEN I HEAR THE QUESTION WHAT DOES THIS BILL DO. IT'LL EXACTLY DO WHAT IT FORCED TO HAPPEN IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY -- WHICH IS HEALTHIER OUTCOMES. NONE OF THE BUSINESSES SHUT DOWN. NONE OF THE FAST FOOD PLACES WENT AWAY [inaudible] THEY'RE THRIVING. AND EVEN DOING A GREAT JOB BUT AT LEAST THE PRODUCT THAT THEY'VE BEEN. SERVING HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME. I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE GONNA GO AWAY OR BE IMPACTED. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR MODEL. THAT'S WHAT WE DO WE EVOLVE AND WE IMPROVE. WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. CLIMATE CHANGE. AND SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE WORK ON THOSE ISSUES. WE EVOLVE AND WE CHANGE AND WE IMPROVE OUR STANDARDS. SO. WHEN I SEE THESE NUMBERS AND WHEN I SEE THE NUMBERS AT THE U. S. LEVEL? BASIC MATH AGAIN 300-27 MILLION US POPULATION NINETY THREE MILLION ARE IMPACTED BY DIABETES. THAT'S 28% OF OUR POPULATION. AND IT'S HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN IF WE THINK WE HAVE COSTS RIGHT NOW BETWEEN ALL OF THESE ISSUES. GOING FORWARD NEXT TWENTY YEARS IF WE DON'T TRY TO ADDRESS THEM RIGHT NOW. AND OUR AGING POPULATION AND AS WE AGE WE HAVE MORE NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES THAT CURRENTLY. ELDER POPULATION IS NOT GETTING TO AN AGE TO DIE FROM BUT WILL BE DYING FROM SOON ENOUGH. WITH ALL OF THESE IMPACT. HOW ARE WE EVEN GONNA BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN? THE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR STATE AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE VERY BASIC WAYS. THAT WE CAN HELP CURB STARTING TODAY SO THAT IN TWENTY YEARS TIME WE SEE THE IMPROVEMENTS JUST LIKE HOW THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY. DID THOSE CHANGES WERE MADE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO ROUGHLY TEN YEARS AGO. AND WE'RE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT. SO I THINK THIS IS. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL -- AND A I SUPPORTED AND I DO HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES SUPPORT THIS AS A INCREMENTAL STEP. TOWARDS IMPROVING HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SHERMAN MAY I THOUGHT IT WAS A QUESTION TO AT ONE POINT IN THAT I THOUGHT THERE WAS A QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE WORKED ON THEM MENU LABELLING RESTAURANTS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT. MISTER MISTER WHICH THERE WAS RUSSIAN -- ACTUALLY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT AT FOR AND I THINK THE KEY POINT -- MISSION IS ARIAN AS THE INFORMATION THAT WAS BEING REQUIRED OF RESTAURANTS IS EXACTLY THE INFORMATION THAT'S ON A CONTAINER TODAY. IT WAS A FULL MENU A FULL CALORIC IMPACT THE FULL YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN THE MAKE UP OF THE PRODUCT PACKAGE PRODUCTS HAVE ALWAYS HAD THAT KNOWS THE ARGUMENT IS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME -- INFORMATION IS PACKAGED FOOD DOES SO. I'M NOT ARGUING AGAINST THAT IT BROUGHT THE IT BROUGHT THE FAST FOOD AND ALL FOOD INDUSTRY ALL RESTAURANTS UP TO THE SAME LEVEL AS WHAT THAT CONTAINER NOW HOLES THERE WAS NOT A WARNING LABEL. ABOUT ANY OF THE ELEMENTS BEING CONSUMED IT THAT FAST FOOD RESTAURANT IT WAS THE SAME INFORMATION IT'S ON THE PACKAGE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AND FORTH TOO MUCH. I THINK IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE WOULD HAVE ALSO SEEN -- LESS IMPACTS HAPPENING. OVER THE OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS I I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY THE CASE I THINK. THE MORE INFORMATION WE PROVIDE THE MORE TRANSPARENCY WE PROVIDE THE MORE LABELING WE PROVIDE. A FACT THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW -- DIET COKE WON'T BE IMPACTED BY THIS WELL THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF LABELING THAT TALKS ABOUT THE SUGAR YOU THE SWEETENER USED IN DIET COKE CAN CAUSE OTHER HARMS. AND SO IT MAKES PEOPLE A LOT MORE CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT WHETHER THEY WANT. TO YOU. DO YOU YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT SO -- I THINK THE MORE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED THE BETTER IT IS AND AND I THINK WE CAN ONLY STAND TO IN PROOF. BOTH ARE HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES AS WELL AS INVIGORATING. AND REINVIGORATING ARE OUR OUR PRODUCERS TO OF OF PROVIDE BETTER UP HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVES RATHER THAN CONTINUING DOWN THE SAME LINE AND SAYING THIRD DOESN'T NEED TO BE ANY CHANGE. WE CONSTANTLY CHANGE AND IMPROVE AND IT'S NOT GONNA HURT ANY BUSINESS MODEL TO CHANGE AND IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCT NOW ON IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YEAH I WANNA THANK ALL THREE ON FOR FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION FOR TO GET ENOUGH SLEEP THIS IS YOUR PROBABLY SECOND THIRD TIME AROUND OF THINKING ABOUT. AND I KNOW WE TALKED -- BRIEFLY THE OTHER DAY ABOUT -- THE ISSUES WITH SUGAR AND AND THE INCREASE OF DIABETES OBESITY I GET IT DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. BUT THE PROBLEM WANTS ON HAVE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS LAST COUPLE YEARS IT SEEMS LIKE. OF THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN TALKED. ABOUT THE INCREASES OF OF ALL THE SAME BECAUSE OF SODAS SUGARY SWEETENED BEVERAGES. AND IT SEEMS BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IS BECAUSE OF THAT I'M GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT SORE ABOUT MYSELF PRIOR TO FROM THE LEGISLATURE. WORKING IN THE ALBUMS INDUSTRY FOR IT'S BEEN OVER THIRTY YEARS NOW. AND I COULD SEE THIS GOING BACK OVER TEN YEARS OUT THERE THAT. WE STARTED TO SEE THE INCREASE OF OBESITY AND DIABETES BACK THEN BUT IT WAS NEVER BECAUSE OF SUGAR IT WAS NEVER BECAUSE OUR KIDS ARE DRINKING SUGAR IT WAS JUST SOMETHING WHAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE ARE BEING AS HEALTHY AS THEY SHOULD BE? THE DISCUSSION WAS NEVER ABOUT THAT FAST FOR TWO NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE SINGLING OUT. ONE OUR LOCAL INDUSTRY OR ONE ONE TYPE OF MANUFACTURE WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING AS A SOUL BECAUSE OF IT AND IT'S NOT THEY COULD BE PART OF IT YEAH DON'T GET ME WRONG. BUT WE LOOK AT THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY. WE SEE THAT BIG INCREASE IT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS I'VE WORKED IN THE FIELD I'VE TAKEN MANY PATIENTS ALSO DOES. AND I'VE SEEN IT. OVER TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO PART OF COMING UP HERE. SO LATELY WHEN I HEAR THAT DISCUSSION MAKES ME. DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WERE BEING HEARD ABOUT. ON ANOTHER ISSUE ON THE TALK ABOUT MY DAUGHTER I DON'T WANT TO SPECIFICALLY NAME THE PLACE WHERE SHE WORKS. BUT SHE WORKS AT A PLACE WHERE THEY SELL -- COFFEE. AND I WAS RECENTLY THERE WATCHING OR SHOES AT WORK BECAUSE SHE WOULD TELL ME. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THESE KIDS ARE COMING WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY'LL GET A DRINK IN THE AD PUMPS OF SIR SHE WAS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH A POMPOUS YOUR PALS. AND THE FAMILIES IN THE MOTHERS ARE WITH THEM AND THEY'LL TAKE FIVE TO TEN POUNDS AND I'VE SEEN THEM. KIDS OF ALL COLORS AND RACES. AND I'M LIKE WOW BUT YET WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT AS AN ISSUE. BUT WE LOOK MORE ABOUT A SUGARY BEVERAGE -- I'M HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH THIS BILL. I THINK THAT'S PART OF IT BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON HOW WE BRING OUR YOUTH. THE STARTS AT HOME WITH OUR PARENTS OUR FAMILIES OR MOTHERS FATHERS OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND TALKING ABOUT HOW TO WE NOT ONLY SUGAR BUT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE DO. I THINK NOWADAYS SOME OF OUR KIDS DON'T LIKE TO BE HEALTHY IN GOING OUT AND DOING EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES WHETHER BE PLAYING. BASEBALL FOOTBALL BASS MIGHT KEEP THE MOTIVATED DO THINGS AFTER SCHOOL INSTEAD OF JUST COMING HOME AND MAYBE JUST SITTING ON THE IPHONE OR IPAD. AND NOT BEING HEALTHY THAT WAY AS WELL BUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY DRINK I THINK IT'S MORE THAN JUST THAT IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING OUT THERE TO OUR UPBRINGING. BUT ALSO TO HOME WITH OUR PARENTS RIGHT HOW DO WE EDUCATE OUR KIDS TO EAT AND DRINK HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES WITH THAT SO JUST SOMETHING I JUST WANTED TO THROW OUT THERE. TO THE FOLKS AND I'M HAVING DIFFICULTIES CENTER SO MAY NOT BE LOOKING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL SO JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO ONE I JUST LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE SENATOR-- SO I'M PREVENTION OR IN BY NATURE IT'S MY TRAINING -- MY EXPERIENCE MY CAREER. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT PREVENTION FOR AND LOOKING AT LONG TERM HEALTH LATELY IT'S ABOUT WILDFIRES WHICH IS ABOUT LONG TERM HEALTH -- I BELIEVE AS WELL -- IT WAS POINTED OUT I THINK. QUESTION BY MR MAYES -- ASKING YOU KNOW WE SHOULD TACKLE THIS AT A NATIONAL LEVEL MAYBE WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS A CALIFORNIA -- AND I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT'S THAT THAT THAT'S INTERESTING THAT I I LEARNED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. WE IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT INVEST MUCH MONEY. IN RESEARCH OR NOT RESEARCH BUT I'M PROGRAMS RELATED TO DIABETES EDUCATION WE DON'T. WE SPEND VERY VERY LITTLE. NOW THE STATE IN NEW YORK ON THE OTHER HAND. INVESTED A WHOLE BUNCH AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED. THE NET THE THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES AND PRE DISS THE THAT PRE DIABETES HAS HAS DECREASED. SO WE HAD A BILL IN HERE -- AWHILE BACK -- ASSEMBLY BILL THE% TAXED THAT THAT CREATED TAX TO CREATE REVENUE THAT WOULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF THAT AND THAT BILL PASSES COMMITTEE -- AFTER IT WAS THE THIRD TIME I'M TRYING TO GET THAT BILL PASSED BUT IT IT DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ANOTHER COMMITTEE -- AND AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS -- OVER THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ON BEHALF ON AND YOUR PERSISTENCE ON BEHALF OF OF CALIFORNIANS. ON BILLS RELATED TO SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES ON WANTING TO ADDRESS THE OBESITY EPIDEMIC. AS WE HEARD OBESITY -- IMPACTS OVER NINETY THREE MILLION ADULTS AMERICANS EXCUSE ME ADULTS AND CHILDREN ALIKE SKEWS ME. OBESITY RELATED CONDITIONS LIKE HEART DISEASE STROKE -- TYPE THE TYPE TWO DIABETES AND CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER ARE SOME OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREVENTABLE. AND PREMATURE DEATHS IN THESE CONDITIONS ARE MADE WORSE. BY THE CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S THE ONLY COSTS AND AND I WILL BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT EXACERBATE CONDITIONS AND AND MAKE MAKE THEM WORSE -- THESE CONDITIONS AT THE CONDITIONS ARE COSTING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND TAKING A PERSONAL TOLL ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR LACK OF DRIVE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION -- LEADS US TO SPEND MONEY -- IN AND HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN CALIFORNIA ON TREATMENT OF DIABETES LIKE INSULIN. LIKE WOUND CARE LIKE PROSTHETICS SOMETIMES BECAUSE WE HAVE TO AMPUTATE -- AMPUTATE AND THEN PEOPLE DIE PREMATURELY -- YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF FOODS THAT HAVE LABELS OUT THERE -- AND I TIED TEND TO LOOK AT THEM AND I LOOK AT LABELS AS A WAY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE. SO FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU GO TO THIS YOU GO TO THE SUPER WHILE RABIN'S IN YOU SEE SALT. LOW SALT. OR DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING SO I'M GONNA SEEM AT THAT POINT AS PRIDE GOT MORE SALT IN IT LOW FAT WHEN IS SOON THE ONES THAT ARE MAYBE HAVE MORE FAT. OF VEGAN. VEGETARIAN. THESE ARE THINGS OUT THERE AND SO. SOME FOOD MANUFACTURERS OF HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO USE THE LABELS AS MARKETING. TO ATTRACT PEOPLE OR GIVE THEM THE OPTIONS. TO TO HAVE AND CONSUME IN IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY -- AND YEAH MAYBE THE INDUSTRY COULD BE CHALLENGED TO DO THAT. PUT IT OUT THERE YOU DON'T LET PEOPLE KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO CONSUME THINGS PEOPLE GO TO CONVENIENCE STORES I GO TO GAS STATIONS AND THEY'RE GONNA CONSUME THINGS IT'S SUMMERTIME IT. IT'S A HUNDRED DEGREES OUTSIDE NOT TODAY BUT IT WILL BE. AN PEOPLE GONNA CONSUME THINGS THERE BUT LET HIM KNOW THAT THEIR WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S IN THERE AND MAYBE MAYBE WILL CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. AND I WAS IN MEXICO A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND I SAW -- AND AIRPORT COMING BACK -- LABELS ON CIGARETTES. SCARE THE HECK OUT OF A PERSON WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S ON THOSE BECAUSE THEIR PICTURES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES. WE HAVE A U. S. SURGE SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING LABEL ON CIGARETTES TO SAY SMOKING CIGARETTES CAN CAUSE CANCER AND DEATH -- WE'RE EDUCATING PEOPLE AND THAT'S HOW I LOOK THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT LABELS SO -- I THINK WE NEED -- TO TAKE A STAND ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE I THINK LABELING INCREASES AWARENESS. IT WAS PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THEY'RE ABOUT TO BUY JUST LIKE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOOD IN THE CALORIC INTAKE PEOPLE LOOK AT THESE THINGS NOW. SO I GUESS WHAT IS INDUSTRY AFRAID OF USE IT AS A MARKETING TOOL IF YOU WISH -- SO I UNDERSTAND. UNFORTUNATELY THAT -- YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE THIS BILL SB THREE FORTY SEVEN A TO YOUR BILL. AND SO WE WON'T BE TAKING A VOTE ON THIS TODAY. BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE CENTER MONEY. WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. FOR AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. AND I THINK JUST KEEN ON ON SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS. THE INDUSTRY. IS. MARKETING ZERO CALORIE ZERO SUGAR BEVERAGES -- THEY SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL BUT THEY'RE STILL. AGGRESSIVELY MARKETING SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES WITH ADDED SUGARS THEIR MARKETING THEM WITH HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AD CAMPAIGNS WE DON'T INVEST IN PREVENTION WE DON'T INVEST IN A MANNER. THAT CAN COMPETE WITH THE INDUSTRY'S ADVERTISING THEY'RE TARGETING OF MINORITY COMMUNITIES OF YOUNG PEOPLE -- WE HEARD FROM A WITNESS TODAY OF OF GROWING UP IN HER COMMUNITY IN TRYING TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES. YOU CITED MISTER CHAIR THE USE OF LABELS EFFECTIVELY IN MARKETING AND ALSO IN PROTECTION. SO MEMBERS. THIS WE DON'T PICK. ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE AN EASY TARGET WE PICK ON SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGES BECAUSE SCIENCE NOT POLITICIANS HAS DETERMINED. THAT THEY'RE NOT ONLY. EMPTY CALORIES THEIR NEGATIVE CALORIE STATE DO DAMAGE. THE INCREASE DENTAL CAVITIES YOUR CHANCE BY 1100%. THAT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THIS TRY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER THIS. IT'S WHY NURSES PTA PARENTS TEACHERS COACHES. ON ALL OF THOSE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE HEALTHY FAMILIES AND HEALTHY CHILDREN. AND YET UNFORTUNATELY. THE POWER OF THIS INDUSTRY. IS INFLUENCING A HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE HEALTH COMMITTEE THAT SHOULD BE HERE TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT. SO IT'S WITH GREAT REGRET. THAT WE HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF THE NECESSARY VOTES TODAY. FOR THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. TO TAKE A STEP THAT IS SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. BY DOCTORS BY NURSES. BY YOUNG PEOPLE ADVOCATES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BECAUSE OF THE RATIONALE IN THE RATIONALIZATIONS. PUT FORWARD BY AN INDUSTRY. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE THESE PRODUCTS THE WILL CONTINUE TO HIRE WORKERS IN YOUR DISTRICTS [inaudible] IN YET [inaudible] THE CHILDREN. THAT ARE THE VICTIMS OF THIS EPIDEMIC. IT'S NOT ME SAYING IT'S AN EPIDEMIC IT'S A SCIENTIFIC TERM. HELD. BY THE OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. PREVENTABLE DIABETES IS EPIDEMIC. IT'S MULTI FACT WORLD I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ WE'VE NEVER SAID THIS IS THE SOLUTION. WE'VE SAID IT'S PART OF A BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH ALLIANCE TO EDUCATE TO PROTECT. IN TO MOVE HELP FOR NOR COMMUNITIES. SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. AND TO BRING THIS BACK NEXT YEAR WITH THE HOPE THAT THERE MIGHT BE THE VOTES FROM THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS IN WITH THAT I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR COURTESY IN ALLOWING US TO PRESENT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU.
