INTERNET OR TELEPHONE SERVICE.

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:49.747

IN GENERAL MY TIME MOST ORGAN.

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:53.785
ARE NOT TENANTS. TO DECREASE

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.787
PAUL ACTS AND HAVE TO HAVE SOME

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:57.989
KIND OF REQUIREMENTS FOR. OR

00:30:58.056 --> 00:31:00.391
ELSE YOU SAW IN THIS SITUATION

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:01.659
IN A PANDEMIC WHERE THE COURTS

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:03.027
TOOK ADVANTAGE I SHOULD SAY

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:04.362
TAKE ADVANTAGE BUT THEY JUST

00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.763
CHANGE THEIR PROCEDURES AND

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.665
DECREASED. WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.734
EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC ACCESS ALSO

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.603
WE HAVE THIS QUESTION ABOUT

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:14.272
VIDEO ACCESS ALSO IT'S A VERY

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:15.974
LEGITIMATE QUESTION. BUT I

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.509
THINK IF IT FALLS INTO THE

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:20.745
NATURE OF A LARGER CONVERSATION

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.580
ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW VIDEO

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:24.782
RECORDINGS IN THE COURT ROOM

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:27.218
LIFE. BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:28.553
THAT IF WE SIT THERE AND SAY

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.988
WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW REMOTE

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:33.725
ACCESS. THE COURT SYSTEM LOSES

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:35.493
CONTROL DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.829
TO HAVE A BAN ON LIVE

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.964
RECORDINGS IN THE COURT ROOM IF

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:41.833
WE'RE TURNING AROUND AND-

00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:43.735
ALLOWING ANYBODY TO COPY A LIVE

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:45.036
RECORDING THERE SO THAT'S A

00:31:45.103 --> 00:31:46.571
LARGER QUESTION. AND I'M

00:31:46.638 --> 00:31:48.072
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:49.274
WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.876
BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS-

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.279
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES-

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:59.017
AS THEY COME UP. SO WITH THAT-

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:02.020

NEWS STORY WAS FALSE.

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.229
RESEARCHERS AT UC SAN FRANCISCO

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.098
FOUND THAT AFTER FORMER

OUR COMMUNITY HAS SKYROCKETED

IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF

MISINFORMATION. CALIFORNIA SO

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.490
CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO

HOWEVER IT'S NOT CLEAR IF ALL

01:28:34.308 --> 01:28:36.077
PLATFORMS TO DOING THIS AS WELL

01:28:36.144 --> 01:28:37.478
AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:40.581
THE PLATFORMS- MAKE THOSE

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:42.583
DISCLOSURES TO THEIR CONSUMERS
