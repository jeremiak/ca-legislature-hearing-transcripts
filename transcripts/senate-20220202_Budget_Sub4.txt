WE ARE REQUESTING THAT GENERAL FUND AND ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR THE INCREASED WORKLOAD THAT WE HAVE AT THE DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. AS YOU KNOW- WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH ALLOCATION FOR THE STATE'S CEILING CAP ON. ALL BOND IS ALREADY FOR CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE ENTERED INTO AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR BOND ALLOCATION WHERE WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED THREE TIMES. AND WITH SUCH RESPONSIBILITY.

ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IN THIS ROW WITH THE L. A. L. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL VERY GOOD ON SATURDAY NIELSEN ANY QUESTIONS. A NO QUESTIONS I JUST HAVE A COUPLE AND THEIR RELATED TO- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET ITEM IS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE IS THAT CORRECT. I COMPLIANCE IT WOULD BE THE NEXT ITEM FOR THE TAX CREDIT. THIS IS FOR BOND ALLOCATION. AND THIS IS FOR- ED TAX EXEMPT BONDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. RIGHT SO THIS THIS REQUEST IS NOT NECESSARILY REGARDING THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS FOR WHICH THE BONDS ARE ARE ARE ISSUED OR THAT THE GRANTS ARE ISSUED FROM THE BOND. IT CERTAINLY IS- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A JOINTS- APPLICATION PROCESS SO WITH THAT BOND ALLOCATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE TAX CREDITS YOU HAVE TO APPLY FOR A BOND TO RECEIVE TAX CREDITS- BUT THE PARTICULAR ISSUE WITH- COMPLIANCE AND THE STAFFING NEEDED FOR THAT IS WITHIN THEIR TAX CREDIT. AN ALLOCATION COMMITTEE ARCHIVE VERY GOOD ALL ASPECTS THE QUESTIONS AND FOR THE NEXT THAT IDENTITY OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS A WHOLE OPEN ITEM SO WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THAT ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN WHICH IS AGAIN THAT CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE BUT IT'S DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLIANCE SECTIONS WORKLOAD INCREASE.

SO IN THIS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WE'VE BEEN AND- INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE TO MONITOR BY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PER YEAR WE ALREADY HAVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND PROPERTIES. SO FIFTY THREE HUNDRED PROPERTIES THAT EVERY THREE YEARS WE NEED TO DO PHYSICAL. INSPECTIONS OF THE PROPERTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE COMPLIANT WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY ORIGINALLY APPLIED. I HAVE FOR THE TAX CREDITS. AND WE'RE FINDING IT SAYS YOU KNOW EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MEET OUR IRS MANDATE TO INSPECT ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES WE DO A PHYSICAL INSPECTION AND ALSO IT'S FILE INSPECTION OF ALL OF THESE PROPERTIES AND- IT YOU KNOW WE ARE BEHIND THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF CODED WE WERE GIVEN A RELEASE FROM THE IRS DO NOT HAVE TO BE THIS IS FILE INSPECTION HOWEVER IT DOES NOT RELIEVE US GOING FORWARD AND- AND- WE STILL HAVE TO SEE THOSE PARTICULAR PROPERTY SO BASICALLY WILL JUST BE A YEAR BEHIND FROM.

THANK YOU FOR THE KIND WORDS AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO TAKE FOR PRESENTATION OF THAT SECOND ITEM GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE OUR SECOND PROPOSAL TODAY. IS TO ACCOMMODATE THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION FORTY ONE. THE REQUEST IS FOR SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND TO FUND FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS STARTING FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AT AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THIS WILL ALLOW FTP TO MATCH THE INCREASING WORKLOAD DUE TO A BOX OF BILLS WITH THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE SECTION FORTY ONE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. THE SECTION FORTY ONE REQUIREMENT WAS INITIALLY ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I REQUIRED VARIOUS ANNUAL REPORTS FOR TAX CREDITS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE REQUIREMENT WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ANNUAL REPORTS FROM ALL RELEVANT TAX EXPENDITURES. THIS WORK REQUIRES OF TV TO ENSURE THE RELEVANT DATA IS ACCESSIBLE AT IN THE DATA I THEIR VIEWS BY FTP TOOK APART THE REQUIRED ANNUAL REPORTS.

WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. YES THIS IS BRIAN WITH THE PORT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE DID WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS CIRCLE THE- WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE TAX PROVISIONS TO INFORM YOUR DECISION MAKING ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS NOW AND SIMILAR FUTURE PROPOSALS. THE PROPOSAL- BEFORE YOU REFLECTS ON A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW TAX CREDITS OR ADOPTED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IT ALSO SEEMS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONTINUE TO ADOPT A MORE- TAX EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE THEY- BASIM FORTY CREDITS ANNUALLY SO WE FIND THIS PROPOSAL FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS REASONABLE. BY THE REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND AS WE MENTIONED ABOVE THAT'S BASED ON ASSUMPTION OF INCREASING WORKLOAD SO IF YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL. DROP SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER TAX CREDITS FOR THE COMING YEARS YOU COULD CONSIDER REJECTING THAT PORTION OF THE REQUEST. VERY GOOD THAT'S HELPFUL INFORMATION QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SAME NINE I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY I AM. MY CRYSTAL BALL DOESN'T ALWAYS TELL ME. WHAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN- THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND HOLD ONTO IT- IF I HAD TO GUESS MY GUESS WOULD BE THAT WE WOULDN'T DO FOR ANNUALLY BECAUSE- THIS GOOD ECONOMY IS NOT GOING TO LAST FOREVER BUT- AGAIN MY- CRYSTAL BALL ISN'T ALWAYS AS GOOD AS- AS IT. COULD BE SO WELL HOLD IT OPEN AND WILL WILL RETURN. TO THIS AT A LATER DATE SO OFTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE- WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHTEEN WHICH IS THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOSTER USED EXPANSION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL BE MAKING THIS PRESENTATION. YES COOLEY WHITE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS PROPOSAL CREATES A NEW ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT BEGINNING IN TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FOR YOUNG ADULTS AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE WE WERE IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AT ANY TIME AGE THIRTEEN OR OLDER. IT IS MODELED AFTER THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT- THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND PROVIDES A FLAT ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FAMILIES THAT OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. I HAVE A CHILD AGE FIVE OR UNDER. SIMILARLY THIS NEW CREDIT WILL ALSO PROVIDE A FLAT ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR. TO YOUNG ADULTS THAT WERE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND WOULD OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE EITC. CREDIT IS INDEXED TO INFLATION AND WILL PHASE OUT SAME AS THE CURRENT YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. FOSTER YOUTH AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE THAT ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND TRIBAL YOUTH THAT ARE UNDER THE STATE'S JURISDICTION WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE CREDIT- ALLOWED TO DULCIMER RAISED IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM GENERALLY SUFFERED IS. DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND POVERTY. FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN THE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR AGE RANGE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION TRANSITION IN THE WORK FORCE. THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS MEANINGFUL CREDIT. THE CREDIT ALSO ENCOURAGES TAX FILING WHICH IS A KEY PART OF BUILDING GENERAL ECONOMIC LITERACY I COULD LEAD TO THE CLAIMING OF OTHER FEDERAL STATE TAX BENEFITS. AMONG THIS POPULATION. THE CREDIT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND WILL REQUIRE DATA SHARING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WHICH WILL BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL APPROVAL. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS COULD POTENTIALLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS CREDIT. AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR TYPICAL TAPE TAKE UP RATES AS WELL AS THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITS- FOR THE CALLIOTROPIDAE. FISCAL COST OF THIS PROPOSALS EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION PER YEAR. AND AFFECT ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY COMMENTS OR CONCERNS BY THE L. A. O. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAD ALAMO. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- AS AS NOTED IN THE- AGENDA- TROUBLING WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED FOR THIS SO WE'RE OUT HERE TO WORK WITH STAFF ONCE THAT- LANGUAGE HAS BEEN RELEASED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND HELP TO COMMITTEE ON THE ONLY COMMENT WE HAD THIS IS POINTING OUT THAT WITH US. A NEW PROGRAM LIKE THIS- OUTRAGE WHICH HAS BEEN A COMPONENT OF THE I. T. C. PROGRAMMING IN THE PAST IS GOING TO BE A KEY CONSIDERATION FO THIS- GROUP- TARGETED HERE FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH- ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM USES UNKNOWN- TAKE UP WILL BE A MAJOR QUESTION AND SO THAT COULD. GREATLY AFFECT THE FISCAL COST AS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS COULD ULTIMATELY BE MORE THAN THAT OR LESS NOT DEPENDING UPON TAKE OFF ON THE STROKE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SINGLE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS TO ME JUST SAY THAT I- THIS IS REALLY AN INNOVATIVE AND- UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO HELP SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE- INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT COME THROUGH OUR SYSTEM THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN- THE END UP AS FOSTER KIDS NOT BECAUSE OF. SOMETHING THEY DID BUT BECAUSE OF AN INABILITY OF THE FAMILY REALLY TO. TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THEM AND- SO I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AS A- AS A AS A PILOT PROJECT- THE QUESTIONS I HAVE I THINK PROBABLY GET ANSWERED ONCE WE HAVE SOME LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD DESCRIBE. HOW FOSTER KIDS WITH ACCESS R. FOUGHT FOSTER INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS THE RESOURCES- AND SO THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ARE THINGS LIKE- IS THERE IS THERE THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO. SEND NOTICES- TO THE INDIVIDUALS- THAT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE SO THAT WERE REALLY. WE HAVE A MUCH. BETTER. FRAMEWORK OR- DATABASE I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE THAT HE AYE TCS REALLY BEEN SLOW ON THE UPTAKE IN TERMS OF FAMILIES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE IT'S BEEN HARD TO- TO ACCESS. THE RESOURCES IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR YOU AND SO- I'M I'M I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME MORE INFORMATION SO WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS- TAX CREDIT WOULD WORK. HOW AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD. BE IDENTIFIED THE RICH COULD YOU SELF IDENTIFY AM A FOSTER CHILD AND SO I'M- I'M STILL NOT A BEIJING I'M IRISH I AM ELIGIBLE FOR THIS MONEY- ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND I WANT TO ASK- AND- FINANCE TO TELL US NOW- I EXPECT IT WILL GET SOME LANGUAGE IN WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA ON HOW THIS WOULD WORK BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY UNIQUE AND- INTERESTING IDEA AND I AM. I AM I'M IN SUPPORT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEMS SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD IT OPEN WILL. LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AND- AND SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO WORK MAYBE THIS THIS- WORKS ALONGSIDE THE EITC- AND WE CAN USE THE FRAMEWORK. OF THE RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ON THE EITC PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE IT MUCH MORE- WIDELY USED I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT IF THE IF WE CREATE A PROGRAM. AND IT'S A PROGRAM TO HELP REDUCE POVERTY. AND ONLY A PERCENTAGE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ACT ACTUALLY CAN ACCESS THAT. THEY WERE NOT MEETING THE MANDATE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WERE REDUCING POVERTY EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME. COMMUNITIES THAT JUST DON'T GET INFORMATION BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE ISSUES AND- ISOLATION ISSUES AND- AND THE LACK OF. OF INFORMATION SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITY SO I THINK YOU FOR THAT REPORT AND- HE SAID AS I SAID THIS ISA HOLD OPEN ITEM AND- WILL BE BACK TO TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. I'M MOVING ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN THIS IS THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT CHANGES. AND AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING IS THAT CORRECT. YES THAT'S CORRECT A GOOD. HI THIS IS ROBIN FINISHED OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET CREATED THE Y. C. T. C. TO HELP LIFT YOUNG CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY THIS CREDIT PROVIDES IN MOST CASES ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE OTHERWISE QUALIFIES FOR THE COUNTY I PC AND HAS A CHILD AGE FIVE OR YOUNGER THE Y. C. T. C. CURRENTLY REQUIRES RECIPIENTS TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR EARNED INCOME EARNED INCOME IS ALL INCOME FROM BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND SELF EMPLOYMENT INCLUDING WAGES SALARIES TIPS. AND OTHER COMPENSATION FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEAR OVER FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND TAXPAYERS CLAIM THIS CREDIT THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL BEGINNING WITH TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO REMOVE THE ONE DOLLAR REQUIREMENT ALLOWS HOUSEHOLDS WITH NO EARNED INCOME OR NEGATIVE EARNED INCOME TO CLAIM THE Y. C. T. C. IF THEY OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE COUNTY IG CITY. SO I CTC IS DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE CHILD POVERTY RATHER THAN AS AN INCENTIVE TO WORK AND THEREFORE IT MAKES POLICY SENSE TO EXTEND THIS BENEFIT FAMILIES WITH NO INCOME TO REMEDIATE CHILD POVERTY REQUIRING EARNINGS EXCLUDES PARENTS WHOSE NEED TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILD PREVENTS THEM FROM MAINTAINING A JOB AS WELL AS THOSE THAT CANNOT FIND. CHILD CARE TO RETAIN A JOB. FAMILIES WITH YOUNG THAT HAVE- AND ARE JUST AS DESERVE OF WRIST. THE CITIES. AS FAMILIES WITH AN- THIS IS. OF HE T. C. EXPECT TO REDUCE GENERAL FUND REVENUES BY FIFTY FIVE MILLION PER YEAR BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THIS PROPOSAL INDEXES THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR AND CHILD TAX CREDIT FOR INFLATION. STARTING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TAX YEAR TO PREVENT INFLATION FROM ERODING THE VALUE OF THIS IMPORTANT TAX CREDIT. FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THIS CHANGE WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH HOW BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL IRAQI CITIES WHICH ARE BOTH INDEX TRANSLATIONS. ARE ADMINISTERED. OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS CHANGE. THE PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUES BY NINETEEN MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THIRTY SEVEN MILLION IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND FIFTY ONE MILLION ANDTWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES A FIXTURE CAL IN NINETEEN SHE COMES OUT. TO AVOID THE FULL ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR Y. C. T. C. BEING ELIMINATED FOR A ONE DOLLAR INCREASE IN INCOME. THE STATE'S EITC PHASES OUT INCREMENTALLY AS INCREASE INCOME INCREASES BEYOND SPECIFIED LEVELS. THE EITC WAS EXPANDED IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO INCREASE ITS MAXIMUM A LITTLE FEES THAT RANGE OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR TAX YEARS TWENTY NINETEEN. TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHICH WAS INTENDED TO ALIGN WITH EARNINGS FOR A FULL TIME WORKER AT MINIMUM WAGE WHICH WILL BE FIFTEEN DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. I IMPORTANT AN INVERSE DRAFTING. LED TO THE E. I. T. C. PHASING OUT ANNOUNCED RATE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THE FOR MAXIMUM ELIGIBLE INCOME WOULD BE AROUND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS RATHER THAN THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WAS INTENDED FOR TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE L. A. O. AS I DON'T KNOW WITHOUT LETTING US OFF THERE'S NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME ASIDE FROM SIMILARLY I WILL BE- WAITING FOR TRAILER BILL TO BE RELEASED TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IN DETAIL. VERY GOOD. SHE DID IT. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THING NO QUESTIONS ARE THIS IS AN ITEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO HOLD OPEN SO WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR THE LANGUAGE AS WELL BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR- TESTIMONY HERE TODAY VERY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUE WHERE TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY. WHICH IS THE S. B. FORTINO NINE REPORT IN MY UNDERSTANDING THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD NAME IS JEANNIE HERMAN AS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. LAST YEAR AFTER HE WAS ASKED TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON OUTREACH METHODS AND OTHER OPTIONS TO REFINING BARRIERS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE. FOR CAL E. I. T. C. HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLAIM THIS FINANCIAL RESOURCE. BEFORE I BEGIN A REVIEW I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR MANY PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT WHICH INCLUDED MANY COMMUNITY BASED ADVOCATES AS WELL AS OUR PEERS STATE AGENCIES THIS REPORT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS COMPREHENSIVE OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THEIR INPUT AND SUPPORT. AND WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP. BUT THE TALKS HERE TO PUT TWENTY TWENTY TALK SHARE WHICH WAS JUST FILED AND PROCESSED. ALMOST FOUR POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS CLAIM TO CALLI AKC RECEIVING FUNDS OF ONE POINT TWO SIX BILLION. FOR THE CALI ATC IN YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT AND ALL OF THEM ARE LIKELY ELIGIBLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT UNDER THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROGRAM. FOR JUMPING INTO THE REPORT THE WAY WE STRUCTURED IT IS PREDOMINATELY ON TABLES ONE TWO AND THREE PROVIDES YOU AN ENTRY LEVEL AND STOCKS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM SINCE ITS INCEPTION. ON PAGES SEVEN EIGHT THESE TABLES ARE PRESENTED AND PROVIDE KEY HISTORICAL INFORMATION ON THE CAL EITC PROGRAM AND ALLOW FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PROGRAM SO THAT ANY CONCEPTS PURSUED TO ENHANCE THE PROGRAM. CANBE VIEWED THROUGH THE LENS OF HOW TO ENHANCE THESE METRICS. HISTORICAL START SHOW THAT ALMOST 80% OF THE CALLIE ATC CREDITS CLAIMED WERE FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS. ALMOST A SINGLE TAX FILER WITH NO DEPENDENTS CLAIMED. ABOUT 11% OF THOSE CLAIMING THE KELLY ATC ALSO QUALIFIED AND CLAIMED THE YOUNG CHILD TAX CREDIT. NOT DIVING INTO THE REPORT ITSELF CONCEPTS WERE DEVELOPED AFTER LISTEN SOLICITING AND EVALUATING AND CLICK FROM NEARLY FIFTY DIFFERENT NONPROFIT STAKEHOLDERS ADVOCATES INTERESTED PARTIES AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. YOU'LL KNOW WHEN READING THE REPORT THAT THERE WAS PURPOSELY NO RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT AS TO WHICH CONTACTS COULD OR SHOULD BE DONE. AS WE RESEARCH THE CONCEPT BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS AND RISKS THE TAXPAYERS IN THE STATE THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD WITH ANYONE CONCEPT. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE PROPOSALS THAT SHOULD BE REVIEWED FURTHER THROUGH A LEGAL LENS TO ENSURE THAT PRIOR TO PURSUIT IT IS UNDERSTOOD IF ANY LEGAL THEORIES EXIST. UNDER FACT CAN BE OVERCOME TO PROTECT BOTH THE TAXPAYERS THE STATE AND ANY STUFF FOR VOLUNTEERS THAT WOULD ENGAGE IN ANY. OF THESE PROPOSED NEW WORK EFFORTS. I HAVE TO BE TO THE APPROACH OF CREATING A COPPER. LISTING OF THESE BENEFITS RISK AND LEGAL CONCERNS. AS WELL AS NINETEEN ADMINISTRATING TIGHT AND MINISTRY OF TYPE ISSUES SUCH AS RESOURCES NEEDED OR PROPOSED TIMING FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THAT WILL SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION ON WHAT TO PURSUE HOW TO PURSUE IT AND WHEN IT IS MOST FEASIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. SO LET'S TAKE A SHORT WALK THROUGH EACH CONCEPT. CONCEPT EIGHT DEALS WITH THE SUGGESTION TO IMPLEMENT A SIMPLIFIED FILING PORTAL AFTER BE ASSIGNED OF FILING PORTAL IN PLACE IN SOME FORM SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. CAL FILE ALLOWS MANY TAXPAYERS TO FILE A TAX RETURN FOR CALIFORNIA FOR FREE. IN MANY SITUATIONS BUT NOT ALL CAL AHEC FOLLOWS WILL QUALIFY WITH FEW IF ANY EXCEPTIONS FOR THIS FREE SERVICE. HOW FILE DOES ONLY ALLOW FUTURE CAL FILE DOES ALLOW FOR THE PRE POPULATION OF WAGE DATA DEPENDING ON WHEN THE TAXPAYER ATTEMPTS TO FOLLOW RETURNS ON WHETHER THEY REGISTERED TO USE THE APPLICATION IN CONCERT WITH MY FTP. LIKE ALL SECTIONS OF THIS PAPER THIS SECTION PROVIDES A HISTORY A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONCEPT AND ADDRESS BENEFIT FROM RISK BARRIERS ADDRESSED AND MINISTRY OF ITEMS SUCH AS COSTS AND TIME NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT. IMPORTANT GAPS UNDERSTAND A FURTHER PURSUIT OF THIS CONCEPT IS DESIRED IS THAT WILL NOT PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR FILING A FEDERAL TAX RETURN. TAXPAYERS WOULD STILL NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED TO FOLLOW FEDERAL RETURN TO CLAIM THEM FEDERAL INCENTIVES. ADDITIONALLY AS POSSIBLE THAT OTHER EXISTING FREE SERVICES AND ACTUALLY HOP GREATER VALUE TO TAXPAYERS. FOR PURPOSES OF FILING BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RETURN FREEZE. AND IN SOME SITUATIONS GIVING THE ALL IMPORTANT ADVANCE PAYMENT OF A TAX REFUND WHICH IS% WE UNDERSTAND VERY IMPORTANT TO TAXPAYERS. CONCEPT BE ADDRESS THE CONCEPT OF PRE POPULATING TAX RETURNS IN USING DATA FROM OUR PEER ORGANIZATIONS TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY. ELIGIBLE TAXPAYERS FOR CAL THANK YOU SEE. HAVE TO BE WORKED CLOSELY WITH SELECT YOUR AGENCIES UNDERSTAND THE DATA THEY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PEERS AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR ENGAGING WITH F. T. B. AS WE STUDY THESE IMPORTANT CONCEPTS. TABLE SEVEN EIGHT AND NINE ON PAGES TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY FIVE THE REPORT SUMMARIZE OUR FINDINGS. WE DID FIND THAT THE DATASETS OWN BUYER PAYER ORGANIZATIONS DID IN FACT HAVE VALUE TO IDENTIFY WHO'S WHO. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER HE WAS NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY A MECHANISM TO BRIDGE THE DEFINITIONAL OR DATA CAPS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSEHOLD UNITS. WHICH ARE APPLICABLE FOR PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS. AND TAX FILING UNIT WHICH IS APPLICABLE FOR FILING A TAX RETURN. THE DEFINITION OF A HOUSEHOLD FOR THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS THOSE THAT LIVE TOGETHER AND PREPARE FOOD TOGETHER. WHILE IT IS HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THE HOUSEHOLD INDIVIDUALS SUFFICIENT DATA IS NOT CONTAINED. TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE STATE OF SUCH AS WHO'S MARRIED WHO'S THE PARENT OF ANYONE CHILD IN THAT HOUSEHOLD. OR TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL TAX FILING UNIT. AND TAXPAYERS ALSO HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE IS HOW TO FILE FOR EXAMPLE A SINGLE PERSON CAN FILE A SINGLE OR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD IF THEY OTHERWISE MEET THE DEFINITION. TABLING IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND DATA GAPS THAT EXIST WHEN USING INFORMATION FROM PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN THE INCOME TAX PROCESS. THIS TABLE IS BASED SOLELY ON A STUDY RELATED TO FILERS 86% OF HOUSEHOLDS AND CDSS DATA DID FILE ONLY A SINGLE RETURN. HOWEVER ONLY 62% OF THE TIME ALL MEMBERS OF THE HOUSEHOLD WERE ACTUALLY VISIBLE ON THE TAX RETURN AND ONLY 57% OF THE TIME THE DEPENDENCE IN THE HOUSEHOLD MATCH THE DEPENDENTS CLAIMED ON THE RETURN. WHEN FTP STUDY TO SPECIFICALLY BALLOT SAMPLE OF THESE FAMILIES AB ACTUALLY WAS ABLE TO CORRECTLY CALCULATE THE CAL E. I. T. C. CLAIMED. ON THE FILED RETURN 37% OF THE TIME. HAVE A TOLERANCE FOR UNDERSTATING ARE OVERSTATING THE CREDIT OF UP TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS EXIST SB WAS ABLE TO COMPUTE THE CREDIT. WITHIN THIS TOLERANCE RANGE 68% OF THE TIME. TABLE NINE EXTRAPOLATED THESE RESULTS FOR FILERS TO NON FILER POPULATION. OF THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE MILLION SINGLE INDIVIDUALS IDENTIFIED IN THIS GROUP. APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE QUALIFIED FOR CAL EITC BASED ON THEIR WAGES ALONE. AFTER HE DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND OF THESE POTENTIAL FIGHTERS HAD SELF EMPLOYMENT INCOME. THAT WOULD HAVE POTENTIALLY REMOVE THEM FROM QUALIFYING FOR KELLY THANK YOU SEE. CONCEPTS MOST IMPORTANTLY DISCUSSES THE FEASIBILITY F USING GOVERNMENT STUFF THAT CAN ASSIST TAXPAYERS WITH PREPARING AND FILING A TAX RETURN OR OTHERWISE PROVIDING THE TAXPAYER WITH A WARM HANDOFF TO APPLY TO STATE. A WARM HAND OFF CAN BE ASSISTED TRACK FARE AND MAKING AN APPOINTMENT HOW TO FIND A LOCATION OR SIMPLY PROVIDING THE TAXPAYER WITH INFORMATION ON WHERE WHAT VI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; IS. AND JARIUS LOCATIONS THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THE SERVICES. FURTHER STUDY ILLEGAL ANALYSIS WOULD BE NEEDED ON THIS CONCEPT. AS THE IRS HAS STRICT RULES FOR RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS. WHO CAN PREPARE AND FILE RETURNS AND BE PAID TO DO SO. A LEGAL CONCERN MAY PRESENT PRESENT SKEWS ME IF GOVERNMENTAL STAFF ARE PAID DURING THE TIME THEY ARE ASSISTING THE TAXPAYER PREPARING A TAX RETURN. ADDITIONALLY MANY VITAL SIGNS ARE ONLY OPEN DURING TYPICAL TAX FILING MONTHS FIRST AS YEAR ROUND DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING. AND VOLUNTEERS. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES UNDER THE SECTION COULD BE STATE OR LOCAL ENTITIES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AS WELL. CONCEPT DEVELOPED OUT RICH OPPORTUNITIES OUR STUDY FOCUSED ON DIRECT OUTRAGE TO TAXPAYERS- IN REGARDS TO BEING DONE BY EITHER FTP OR OUR PEERS STATE AGENCIES. THE SECTION DOES NOT IN GENERAL ADDRESSED THE GENERIC OUTREACH THAT IS CRITICAL TO DEAL AND PERFORMED BY MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS. A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING FOR ENGAGING AND DROPPED OUT REACHES THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP OF CLIENTELE AMONG THE VARIOUS PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND UNDOUBTEDLY ANY TAXPAYERS AT AFTER SHE MIGHT REACH OUT TO AVOID TAXPAYER CONFUSION- OVERSATURATION. SPECIFIC COORDINATION ABOUT REGION TASK UNDERTAKEN SHOULD OCCUR ACTUALLY IN MANY OF OUR PEER DEPARTMENT STAND READY TO ENGAGE ON THIS EFFORT AND FURTHER DISCUSSION. HERE ARE TWO KEY ITEMS WHEN DIRECT OUT REACH COULD BE PERFORMED MOST SUCCESSFULLY. ON A PRE FILING OF RETURN BASIS REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE. NINETEEN EIGHT FIVE THREE REQUIRES EMPLOYERS AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE POGRAMS TO REACH OUT ANNUALLY AND INFORM THEIR EMPLOYEES AND PARTICIPANTS OF THE CAL E. I. T. C. THIS REMAINS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE OUTREACH PROGRAM ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS DIRECTLY TO TAXPAYERS. BUT WE MAY WISH TO REVIEW THE EXISTING SUCH IT TO SEE IF IT IS ONE TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN BE ENHANCED TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE MORE FREQUENT OUTREACH THROUGHOUT THE FILING SEASON. HOUSE FILING ONE AFTER RETURNS HAVE BEEN FILED WHICH IS TYPICALLY GOING TO BE- ON THE DUE DATE OF APRIL FIFTEENTH TWENTY. OF ANY TALKS HERE. AS RESOURCE RICH CAN BE CONDUCTED ON TAXPAYERS WHO FILED A RETURN. ELIGIBLE FOR CHALFONT CAL THE AGENCY BUT DID NOT CLAIM. WHICH WOULD BE OUT REACH CONDUCTED BY F. TV. ALLEN OUT REACH FOR NON FILERS IS ALSO POSSIBLE WITH THOSE NON FILERS THAT HAVE PROVEN WAGES THAT ARE WITHIN THE QUALIFYING RANGES OF THE CALLIE H. C. CREDIT. I'M NOT CAN BE TOUGH CUTS DID BY VARIOUS STATE ENTITIES INCLUDING MANY OF THE CARE DEPARTMENTS WE WORK WITH AN FTP. DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WOULD BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT COULD BE DONE AS WELL. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS ARE WARNED TO DEVELOP APPROACHES TO DO THIS TYPE OF OUT REACH INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS ON TIME YOU KNOW THE OUT REACH. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD BE MARKETED SUCH AS KELLY IDC FEDERAL INCENTIVES AND VITAL SERVICES. HOW AVERAGE JUST PERFORMED TAXED CALLS LETTERS. OPTIONS FOR ALL TAXPAYERS CAN RESPOND TO THAT REGION HOW TO SUPPORT TAXPAYERS RECEIVING THESE OUTRAGE NOTIFICATIONS. IMPORTANT GAPS TO FOCUS ON WOULD BE ENSURING TAXPAYERS ARE SUPPORTED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND NOT LEFT WITH A SENSE OF UNEASE THAT THIS IS A SPAM TYPE OUT REACH. I'M TIMING WOULD ALSO BE CRITICAL IF ANY PRE POPULATING OF DATA IS DESIRED. BEST DATA IS TYPICALLY NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE ORIGINAL DUE DATE OF RETURN. FOR EXAMPLE IF A RETURN IS DUE APRIL FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE LAST YEAR. WE WOULD JUST NOW BE APPROACHING THE TIME FRAME WHERE BEST DATA IS AVAILABLE TO CONDUCT OUTREACH. WHILE OUTRAGE COULD BE CONDUCTED EARLIER YOU RUN THE RISK THAT ANY PRE POPULATED DATA IS INCOMPLETE AND INCORRECT. ON THE CREDIT COULD BE UNDERSTATED OR OVERSTATED PUTTING THE TAXPAYER IN AN UNDESIRED POSITION. FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOR DECADES TAX ENTITIES ACADEMIC STUDY PARTNERS AND OTHER TRUSTED PARTNER ENTITIES HAVE CONDUCTED THIS TYPE OF OUTREACH. AND ALL THOSE EFFORTS DID PRODUCE RESULTS WHICH IS GOOD NEWS AND GENERAL THE RESPONSE RATE WAS TYPICALLY LESS THAN 25% AND IN MANY OF THESE CASES LESS THAN 5% CONCEPT EVEN LATE FOR CALIFORNIA ISSUE IN A UNIQUE FINALLY NINETY THAT CAN BE USED INSTEAD OF AN I. TEN. OR THE INTERMISSION I TEN AS BEING ISSUED BY THE IRS WITH THE PROCESS CAN BE LENGTHY. IMPORTANT GAPS UNDERSTAND IF THIS CONCEPT IS FOR JUNE PERCENT. IDENTITY THEFT IS A CRIME A SIGNIFICANCE TODAY WITH MANY SUGGESTING THERE ARE FEW INDIVIDUAL WHOSE PERSONAL DATA HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY. ANY FUNCTION ESTABLISH ALLOW FOR UNIQUE CALIFORNIA IDENTIFIER WOULD NEED TO BE PURSUED WITH CAUTION TO ENSURE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. AND STARTING THE PROCESS OF HOW THE IRS OF VERIFIED IDENTITY IDENTITY EXCUSE ME AND BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE NATION TO IDENTIFY AN INDIVIDUAL. AN IN PERSON EXPERIENCE AS NECESSARY TO ALLOW FOR THE STUDYING OF KEY CONTROL. DOCUMENTS PROVING THE PERSON'S IDENTITY. IN LIGHT OF THIS SB NOT READ SEEN ADVANTAGE TO PURSUE THE ISSUE OF THE IN HEALTH. I THE PROCESS SHOULD AN MUST LIKELY WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY MAYOR. THE PROCESS THE IRS FOLLOWS THE MIDDLE TRYING. ADDITIONALLY HAVE TO BE TO NOT COVER HAVE SUCH OFFICE LOCATIONS TO MANAGE SUCH A PROGRAM WHICH WOULD MEAN WE WOULD NEED TO PARTNER WITH STRATEGICALLY PLACED ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH COULD FOR THE RESULT IN COST TO THE TAXPAYERS WALLS INTRODUCED RISK TO THE TAXPAYER FOR SITUATION OCCURRED WHERE DATA WAS SOMEHOW COMPROMISED. FINALLY AFTER THREE WOULD NOT THE SOLUTION DOES NOT RESOLVE THE NEED FOR TAXPAYER TO FOLLOW FEDERAL RETURN TO. CLAIM THOSE FEDERAL INCENTIVES. CONCEPT AB INCLUDES ONE FOR THE CONCEPT WITH THE GOVERNMENT STUFF CAN ASSIST WITH THE ISSUANCE OF AN ITEM. FURTHER STUDY AND LEGAL ANALYSIS WOULD BE NEEDED ON THIS CONCEPT AS CYRUS AGAIN HOW STRICT AND INFLEXIBLE RULES FOR ISSUING AN AYE CHAN. MUST RECIPROCALLY TO REQUEST AN ITEM FOR THE FIRST TIME ATTRACTION GENERALLY NEEDS TO BE FILED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITHOUT APPLICATION. AS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN CONCEPT SEE A LEGAL CONCERN MAY PERCENT OF GOVERNMENT STUFF ARE PAID DURING THE TIME THEY ARE SEEING DOCTORS ARE PREPARING TO TAX RETURN. OR NIGHT TEN APPLICATIONS. SOME VITA SITE GET WELL ASSIST. INCOMPLETE IN THE STORE EFFORT. HOWEVER MOST FIGHTERS TO NOT OPEN YEAR ROUND DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING AND VOLUNTEERS. CONCEPT ART FOR LATE SIX EXPANSION AND PUBLICATION OF TAX FORMS MATERIALS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. OF TV'S WEBSITE HAS OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR. AND GENERAL FTP IS WEBSITE IS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH WITH SELECT PAGES AND APPLICATIONS ALSO JUST PLAIN IN SPANISH OR OTHER LANGUAGES. TO MEET ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE NEEDS OF TO BE HAS SUPPLIED GOOGLE TRANSLATE TOOL FOR DOCTORS TO USE THAT WOULD CONVERT MULTIPLE PORTIONS OF OUR WEBSITE TO DISPLAY IN OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT ONE HUNDRED AND NINE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OPTIONS. THIS TOOL DOES NOT ALWAYS CORRECTLY TRANSLATE TECHNICAL INFORMATION THOUGH NOT AS A CONVERT PDF DOCUMENTS TO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND FOR LONG STANDING BUSINESS REASONS AFTER THE ATTACK FORMS ARE GENERALLY PUBLISHED AS PDF DOCUMENTS THAT CAN BE DOWNLOADED. FOR USE OR REFERENCE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FORMS ARE IN ENGLISH WITH SELECT FREQUENTLY USED FORMS ALSO PUBLISHED IN SPANISH. IMPORTANT GAPS HUNDRED FAN OF THIS CONCEPT IS PURSUED IS THAT HAVE TO BE IS RETURN PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH SUPPORTS THE TIMELY PROCESSING OF RETURNS AND ISSUANCE OF REFUND FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. VERY SENSITIVE DATA PLACE ON EACH FORM WHICH CAN BE COMPROMISED THE FORMS ARE SUBMITTED FOR PROCESSING IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH. ADDITIONALLY AFTER B. IS CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH TIMELY PUBLISHING EXISTING FORMS AN ENGLISH TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS NEED IN THESE FORMS TO FILE. REQUIRING FORMS AN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WILL ONLY FURTHER DECREASE OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY POST THESE TAX FORMS. NEVERTHELESS BOTH OF THESE ISSUES CAN LIKELY BE MANAGED BUT SPECIFIC ATTENTION TO THESE MATTERS AS NECESSARY TO AVOID UNWANTED IMPACT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. BOB ENOUGH CONCEPTS JAN H. REALLY TO ENHANCE FUNDING STRATEGIES FOR OUTREACH FUNDS TO OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERS. THESE CONCEPTS DOCUMENT BENEFITS AND RISKS WITH GRANTING FUNDING ARE NOT GRANTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY GRANTING FUNDING ON GOING IN THE STATE BUDGET. OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS ARE OBSERVED WITH THE INABILITY 2% FUNDING YEAR OVER YEAR. AND CONTINUALLY AND DUST OPERATION THE ABILITY TO PERFORM CONTINUAL OUT REACH OF MOST IMPORTANTLY YEAR ROUND TAX FREE TAX PREPARATION SERVICES. THANK INCREASE THANK YOU YOUR TIME TODAY ON ALLOWING ME TO QUICKLY SUMMARIZE THIS REPORT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT- EXTENSIVE EXPLANATION- REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO. STUDYING THE OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN ORDER TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO GET THAT KELLY ITC OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU KNOW I. AM ALSO ON THE RULES COMMITTEE SO IF I'M TOGGLING BACK AND FORTH IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M AN INTERESTED IT'S BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO BE MORE THAN ONE PLACE AT THE SAME TIME. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- YOUR PRESENTATION AND REALLY AS IT RELATES TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY I BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE FROM THE REPORT. WE'RE DOING A LOT. TO HELP COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- AND WE'RE DOING MORE TO HELP WITH THEM THEN WE ARE TO HELP THOSE ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS WHO NEED THIS MONEY- AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN PILOTING OUT. YOU KNOW YOU BE I PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH ESSENTIALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT PEOPLE ARE POOR ANY KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THEY NEED EXTRA MONEY AND IS LIKE YOU KNOW IMPARTING SOME FAITH ON THEM TO MANAGE THEIR FINANCES WELL WITH THIS EXTRA INFUSION. BASED ON DATA AND STUDIES AND PILOT DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT HAS SHOWN THAT THAT CAN BE THE CASE ARE ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO CHASE MONEY THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND WHY WE ARE CONTINUING TO OVER FIND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO WORK WHERE WE SEE THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE CONNECTING TO. THESE HOUSEHOLDS THAT NEED. THESE CREDITS IN THIS EXTRA MONEY SO CAN WE LIKE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FLIP THE SCRIPT. I'M STILL ALL TIME AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IT'S MY- PLACE TO REALLY DEFINITIVELY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION- BUT THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW SOME GOOD POINTS- KNOWLEDGE OF THE CREDIT. IS CERTAINLY A JOB THAT WE'VE SEEN AND HEARD I'M TRYING TO ADDRESS IN THIS REPORT- AND THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS THAT WE KNOW THAT ARE AWARE OF THE CREDIT. AND SHE'S NOT TO CLAIM IT BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE AND THE BURDEN TO CLAIM IT ON A TAX RETURN. SO- OVER THE YEARS- IF I CAN TAKE ITBACK ON A WALK TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND FOR THEIR THEIR BEEN ON AND OFF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT- WHETHER THIS IS. IS THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE TALKS WORLD WHERE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO FILE A RETURN- DO YOU CHANGE THE TO LEGAL DEFINITION OF RIGHT OF RETURN FILED IS OR THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL PREPARE IT FOR YOU BUT THAT WOULD JUST BE A CALIFORNIA ONLY SOLUTION. WHICH DOESN'T- REALLY GOT THE MONEY THAT'S MOST- TREATED AT THIS TIME WHICH IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- AND FEDERAL DISCUSSIONS OF COURSE AND SOLUTIONS ARE ARE REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF CONTROL OF F. T. B. EVEN AS WE MIGHT TRY TO ATTEMPT TO ENGAGE THE IRS. ON SOLUTIONS FOR THESE MATTERS. SO I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE BIT- I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOOD ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. WE DON'T. SUPPORT LAST THING YOU SAID. BECAUSE I LIKE HONESTY IF WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER THEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SAY THAT SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE TO DISSECT THE CHALLENGES SO THAT WE CAN GET TO A BETTER RESOLUTION BUT- I JUST THINK WE DO OURSELVES A DISSERVICE WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE GREATER TRUST BETWEEN CALIFORNIANS AND THE STATE. WHEN WE MAKE IT HARD FOR FOLKS TO HAVE ACCESS TO WHAT THEY DESERVE- AND HOW WEEK BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU CLOSE POVERTY GAPS- AND SO YOU KNOW. ITHINK MAYBE THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE FOR THE YEAR FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WHY I AM THAT'S THE REASON THAT THE REPORT WAS COMMISSIONED- IT WAS WE HAVE BEEN SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN OUTREACH AND- AND I AGREE WITH YOU A 100% WE'RE- SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON OUTREACH AND NOT ENOUGH ON GETTING. YOU KNOW THE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY NEEDED AND I UNDERSTAND IT I JUST LET ME JUST SAY THAT LISTENING TO YOU EXPLAIN THE CHALLENGES OF EACH ONE OF THESE OPTIONS- WAS REALLY INSTRUCTIVE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS ARE EASY TO MAKE IT'S EASY TO MAKE THEM EASY WHY CAN'T WE JUST GET THIS MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. ARE DON'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY. AND- AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE THING BUT IT'S NOT AND SO PART OF I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. IS LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE OUTLINED. AND I THINK WHAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IS IT AND I DON'T KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEYOND WHAT YOU LOOKED AT BUT- TO TELL US WHAT WOULD IT COST. TO DO ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES- SOMEBODY INVOLVED- TECHNOLOGY SOME OF IT INVOLVES- GETTING PERMISSION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH MIGHT BE TOUGH BUT IT LIST IF WE KNOW WHAT THE COST WOULD BE WE COULD WE COULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WHAT'S THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO AND BECAUSE I WANT AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE WE- WE REALLY WANT TO GET. MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF FAMILIES AT THIS CAN MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. WITH AND- I AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE HAD SO MANY COMMUNITY BASED ADVOCATES THAT WERE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE AND HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HAVING IT FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME NOW AND- AND I THINK WE NEED WE NEED SOME SOLUTION. SOUTH THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THIS WAS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. CRUCIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TODAY. SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE. ITEM NUMBER TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS THE TAX PAYMENT. FLEXIBILITY FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PRESENT AS WELL. I THANK YOU THIS IS AN ECONOMIST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMICS NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THEREFORE THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO THOSE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHO MAY BE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY BY ALLOWING THEM TO DELAY THEIR TAX PAYMENTS. AND NOT INCUR INTEREST FOR PENALTIES RELATED TO LATE FILING FOR PAYMENTS. IT WOULD BE OPERABLE FOR TAX YEARS TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE PAYMENT DUE DATES I RELATED TO THIS TAX YEARS OR AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC TAXPAYERS EARNING LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND MARRIED FILING JOINTLY HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WOULD HAVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO PAY THEIR TAXES FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAX YEARS. INTEREST IN PAYING INTEREST AND PENALTIES WOULD BEGIN TO ACCRUE A NEW AS OF OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON ANY UNPAID BALANCE. IN SITUATIONS WHERE AN ELIGIBLE TAXPAYER HAS ALREADY MADE A LATE PAYMENT FOR THE ELIGIBLE TAX YEARS. AND PAID A LATE PENALTY OR INTEREST THE F. T. B. I WILL AUTOMATICALLY REFUND. THE PENALTY AND INTEREST PAYMENTS- THANKS I'LL OPEN UP ANY QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BY THE LA- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS POINT- AGAIN WAITING TO- SEE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- ONE COMMENT BOB. WHAT I'M SURE OBVIOUSLY THAT- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT THE LEGISLATURE SCHOOLS OF TARGETING- THE DEFERRAL OPTION- BUT WE'LL SEE WHEN THE TRAILER BILL COMES OUT WILL BE WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE'LL WAIT TO SEE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WELL. MAKE SURE IT STAFF. DOES IT WE THINK IT SHOULD DO. WAY TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO. WHICH IS THE INNOVATION HEADQUARTERS CREDIT AGAIN THE PRESENTATION IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS IS NICK THOMAS AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE INNOVATION HEADQUARTERS CREDIT WOULD BE IN PLACE FROMTWENTY TWENTY TWO. THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WILL PROVIDE A NEW RESEARCH CREDIT FOR COMPANIES INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ARE HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. THE CREDIT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND WOULD TARGET A REVENUE LOSS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- THIS PROPOSAL RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF RESEARCH. AND INNOVATION IN CONFRONTING THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THIS ONE IN A SERIES OF SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. THANKS OPEN UP ANY QUESTIONS. VERY GOOD- COMMENTS FROM THE L. A. O. YES THIS IS BRIAN WHETHER FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO- DEVALUATION OF ITS DETAILS. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YES THE CAMERA YES SO I THINK I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION NGUYEN AND HOW WILL THIS GET FLUSHED OUT- BECAUSE IT'S- INTERESTING INTRIGUING AND FINANCE- WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING OUT A NUMBER OF DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL- AND WE EXPECT SAID HOW THIS LANGUAGE AVAILABLE IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING- WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OTHERS AS WELL AS WE DEVELOP THOSE DETAILS. INCLUDING CRITERIA. YES THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR QUESTIONS. I DO I DO HAVE- LET ME JUST SAY THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT. I THINK IT'S BEING DEVELOPED- I MIGHT MY TWO CENTS WORTH IS- AND I THINK I MY BIGGEST CONCERN WITH IT IS THAT IN YEARS PAST. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN A BUDGET BUT THE POLICY WOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BE CARRIED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND- THE REASON THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT IS THEN WE HAVE INPUT INTO WHAT. WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF TAX CREDIT IF WE'RE GONNA DO CREDITS- THAT THAT- THAT MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMY WHICH IS USUALLY WHAT TAX CREDITS ARE ALL ABOUT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. NUMBER ONE THAT IT WILL ACHIEVE GOALS THAT WE SET UP WERE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT THOSE GOALS NUMBER TWO THAT EVERY REGION IN THE STATE CAN PARTICIPATE IN. IN HAVING THE TAX CREDIT IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY'RE CREATING JOBS IN THEIR COMMUNITY- AND WE TEND TO SEE THAT THE TAX CREDITS GO. FIVE WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A GOOD JOB BASE AND SO- SO MY COURT MY BIG QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO REACH AND I KNOW IT'S A- IT IS. TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT AS WE START TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF. SHEPHERDING IN OUR SOLAR ENERGY AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND YET WE- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT ARE CREATED- IF YOU PUT SOLAR ON YOUR RESIDENCE NONE OF THE PANELS COME FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YET WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE PANELS AND SO WHY AREN'T WE USING A TAX CREDIT. TO BUILD- SOLAR PANELS THEY GET USED ON THE HOMES IN OUR OWN STATE IF WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE. ELECTRIC BUSES WHICH IS ONE OF THE AGENDA ITEMS FOR THE BUDGET IS TO START FOCUSING ON. ELECTRIC BUSES AND I BELIEVE IT IF I RECALL IT WAS FOR SCHOOLS. IT'S A TERRIFIC GOAL IT'S WONDERFUL I SUPPORTED BUT WHY AREN'T WE BUILDING I'M HERE IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND IF WE ARE GOING TO BUILDING HERE. THEN THE TAX CREDIT OUT TO GO TO MEET THE GOALS OF THOSE BUSES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PURCHASING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE CAN- FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THE STATE WHICH WE'VE LOST OVER THE YEARS. AND WHICH WOULD READ IT REALLY BENEFIT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND COMMUNITIES IN. A CUP- COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DESPERATE FOR GOOD JOBS. AND THAT ARE HAVING A CHALLENGE BECAUSE- THEY'RE NOT COMING TO OUR COMMUNITY SO. THIS IS A HOLLOW OPEN ITEM I AM HOPING THAT AS WE LOOK TO- INVESTMENTS IN IN TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE ALSO LOOK AT JOB CREATION AND THE ABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION TO. TO TO JOBS AT THAT ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY SO- AGAIN THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM. MORE ON THAT LATER BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THAT. ARE MOVING ON WE'RE GOING TO- MOVE ON TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THIS IS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE. WHICH IS THE- REMOVAL OF PROVISION ONE POSITION CONTROL AND THIS IS. IN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION. YES. SO IF I'M IF I COULD TURN THE MIKE OVER TO. THE DEPARTMENT. CORRECT BURKE SENTENCED PARKER TO FINANCE. THE LEGISLATURE- I HAD A PROVISION ONE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION FRANCHISE TAX BOARD SUPPORT ITEMS BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AS RESPONSE THAT. A REVENUE GENERATING POSITIONS WERE BEING REDIRECTED TO NON REVENUE GENERATING WORKLOADS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES REMOVING THE PROVISION ONE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT HINDERS THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFICIENCIES AND THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO NEW WORKLOADS AND OTHER ISSUES. WITH US TODAY WE HAVE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THE CD TFA AND BE WE TO ADD. TO FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT VERSION ONE AND THE IMPACTS TO THESE TAX AGENCIES I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST. START WITH I JEANNIE HERMAN AT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD FROM BACKGROUND TO DISCUSSION ON THE PROVISION ONE. THANK STARK FELL- YES SO HAPPY TO DISCUSS THIS AND ACTUALLY BE WRITTEN OUT THE- THE SUPPORT FOR REMOVING THIS LANGUAGE- WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION BACK IS VERY AWARE OF OUR COMMITMENTS AND GOALS GETTING WORK DONE- AND WE GO ON ABOUT AND BEYOND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT. OVER THE YEARS PROVISION ONE WHICH HAS BEEN N PLACE- I'LL DESCRIBE IT IS IT WAS REALLY PUTTING BECAUSE THAT REALLY DRIVES IT HOME WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS DONE. IN THE VERY. LATE NINETIES- WITH AN R. OR- AND AUDITOR THAT WORKS WITH A TAXPAYER CONSIDERED PROVISION ONE. HOWEVER AN AUDITOR THAT USES A MAIL ROOM TO ISSUE A NOTICE OR USES TECHNOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING OR NEEDS TO GO TO TRAINING OR NEEDS TO BE MANAGED NONE OF THOSE OUTLINE ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR THE AUDITOR TO BE- ADDITION AND EFFECTIVE AT WHAT THEY DO ARE CONSIDERED PROVISION ONE. BY THE TIME YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE ANCILLARY ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT THAT HONOR HE ALMOST ARE NOT AN ORGANIZATION THAT'S ENTIRELY PROVISION ONE WHICH FOR THE NEGATES THE NEED FOR THAT TYPE OF A PROVISION IN PLACE. NEVER THE LESS OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN- REMINDED THAT- AUTRES OUR AUDITORS ON THEIR PART A PROVISION ONE COLLECTORS BY ENFORCEMENT AGENTS ARE PART OF PROVISION ONE- AND THOSE OTHER FOLKS ARE NOT. WITH THE WAY THAT WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS TODAY- BECAUSE OF THE TRYING TO THE TIME OR BECAUSE OF OUR EDR PROJECT- AND NOW EASIER TO YOU. WE ARE VERY COMPREHENSIVE SPIDER WEB OF FUNCTIONS THAT ALL WORK OGETHER SUCCESSFULLY OR NOT WORK TOGETHER SUCCESSFULLY. SO- BUT A KEY EXAMPLE AGAIN THAT I CAN POINT OUT IN RECENT YEARS WHEN EDR CAME FORWARD TRAINING WAS A JOB THAT WE HAD MISSED AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH TRAINING WAS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT WITH A MASSIVE CHANGES WE WERE DEALING. SO PER TRAINING IS NOT CONSIDERED PROVISION ONE. THAT SHOULD BE DID NOT PUT ADEQUATE RESOURCE TEAM FORWARD AND BCPS SO THIS DEPARTMENT WE STRUGGLED WITH FINDING RESOURCES. THAT COULD BE REDIRECTED TO TRAIN ALL OF OUR STUFF- AND IN SOME SITUATIONS WE SUCCEEDED IN OTHERS WE DIDN'T RESULTING IN LOSS OF RETRAINING EFFORTS THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN AND STOCKS THAT REALLY STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE NEW TOLLS- MAS OF LESSONS LEARNED SO- IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST SAY OF TO BE WOULD VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO OPTIMIZE OUR- ACTIONS AND OUR OPPORTUNITIES. FOR RESOURCE GAPS THE PRESENT AND THE DEPARTMENT THAT COULD NOT OTHERWISE BE TIMELY SOLVED BY A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH. THIS IS DARK SINISTER AND FINANCE WE HAVE JASON FROM TEACHING BAY TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE IMPACTS THEIR AT THE TV TAMPAK. SURE THANK YOU DEREK AND JUST- I CONTINUE OFF OF WHAT AND SHE HAD SAID I'M HONEST BEHIND- PROVISIONAL ONE IS THAT YOU CAN THERE'S A YOU CAN DISTINGUISH REVENUE MAKING FROM NON REVENUE MAKING POSITIONS AND I THINK IN REALITY. ALL FUNCTIONS PLAY A ROLE IN- IN GENERATING REVENUE WE JUST GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF ONE IS OUR DATA SCIENTISTS- AND I WOULD ASSUME IT'S THE SAME ON THAT THE- WE HAVE TO BE OUR DATA SCIENTISTS TODAY ARE CONSIDERED NON REVENUE MAKING- BUT- THEY ACTUALLY DO A LOT OF- WORK THAT DOES. GENERATE REVENUE FOR EXAMPLE THEY IDENTIFY NONCOMPLIANCE WHICH DENSER AS LEADS FOR AUDITORS TO GO ON FIND MORE MONEY ANOTHER EXAMPLE I THINK SIMILAR TO A GENIUS THAT IS OUR AUDIT SUPERVISORS ARE CONSIDERED NON REVENUE MAKING TODAY- OF COURSE THEY'RE ESSENTIAL FOR AUDITS- BECAUSE- ON DAYS LIKE BUSINESSES TO ON IT- THEY REVIEW AUDITS- AND SO THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES AS WELL BUT BASICALLY. PROVISIONAL ONE I THINK THE PROMISE ON THIS NOT AS RELEVANT TODAY AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND IT DOESN'T HE GIVE BILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. ALLOCATE RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU JASON AND FINALLY WE HAVE BRENDA FLEMING. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE RURAL AND MEMBERS OF THE SISTINE COMMITTEE I AM BRENDA FLEMING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION I'M JOINED TODAY BY ONE OF MY MANAGERS- CHIEF OF OUR SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION IS CATHY TAYLOR. I CONSISTENT WITH MY WITH MY COLLEAGUES HAVE INDICATED THAT IS A PART OF THE OTHER STATE TAX AGENCIES BE WE SUPPORT. THE REMOVAL OF THE PROVISION ONE BUDGET LANGUAGE. THE BILL WE IS THE ONLY ALEXIS TAX BOARD IN THE COUNTRY COMPRISED OF FOUR EQUALIZATION DISTRICT MEMBERS AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER. THE BILL WE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THREE TAX PROGRAMS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO OUR STATE. PROPERTY TAX THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX AND THE TAX ON INSURERS. AND FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY THE STATE STATE BUT NEXT STATEWIDE ASSESSED VALUE WISE SIX POINT EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS RESULTING AND SEVENTY FIVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A PROPERTY TAX LEVIES. THOSE PROPERTY TAX LEVIES CONTRIBUTED FORTY POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SCHOOLS AND THIRTY FOUR POINT. NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. A YEAR THE BEING WE STEPS VALUES OF AS PROPERTIES PRIMARILY PRIVATELY OWNED PUBLIC UTILITIES REGULATED RAILROADS AND INTERCOUNTY PIPELINES. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE VALUES ARE SET AT A HUNDRED NINETEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WHICH PRODUCED MEMBERS ONE POINT EIGHT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS TO LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. IN ADDITION BE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE TAX PROGRAM PRODUCED THREE HUNDRED SIXTY NINE NINE DOLLARS AND A TAX ON INSURANCE PROGRAM ADDED TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TO THE GENERAL FUND. YOU WE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR TAX PROGRAM MEMBERS CONSIST OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION OVERSIGHT MANAGER TOREY FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER OUT OF ALL MEMBERS OUT OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AGENCY POSITIONS CURRENTLY A BE A WEEK. EIGHTY EIGHT ARE ALLOCATED AS PROVISIONAL POSITIONS IN OUR PROPERTY TAX DEPARTMENT. THE EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY INFORMATION ON POSITIONS PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF DUTIES MUCH OF WHICH ARE NOT REVENUE GENERATING. THIS DEMONSTRATES ARTICLE MEMBERS THE GAP BETWEEN SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN RELATION TO THE PROVISIONAL AND DESIGNATION. THE REMOVAL OF THE PROVISION ON REQUIREMENTS WHAT CONTRIBUTE TO OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AS MY COLLEAGUE THE MEDICATED AND REDUCE THE OVERHEAD COSTS CONNECTED TO MANAGING PROVISIONAL ON POSITIONS AND REMOVING THOSE CONSTRAINTS. TO CONCLUDE SINCE MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES OF WELL DESCRIBE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WHAT IT TO CONCLUDE THIS BUDGET POLICY CHANGE WHAT FURTHER ASSESS THE B. WE ANY OTHER AGENCIES AND FOR FAILING OUR OUR DUTIES FOR THE B. AWAY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY DUTIES AND OUR MISSION. WHICH IS TO SERVE CALIFORNIANS THROUGH FAIR ADMINISTRATION AND SUPPORT OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THANK YOU. MEMBERS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

NO WE JUST REITERATED LANGUAGE LIKELY DOES REDUCE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S FLEXIBILITY THAT MOST OTHER DEPARTMENTS ENJOY. SO WE DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM BUT IF YOU HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF THE POVISION ONE LANGUAGE WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF. TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT ADDRESSES THE LEGISLATURE'S CONCERNS WHILE ALSO- YOU KNOW PERHAPS SAID ALLOWING GREATER FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE THE DEPARTMENTS. VERY GOOD ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER KAMAGRA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN THE L. A. O.'S- ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS. I AFTER LISTENING TO THE PRESENTATIONS OF COURSE I AM ALL FOR US FINDING WAYS TO GET THE MONEY- THROUGH TAX COLLECTIONS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE ARE ALL LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE DO WORK AND HOW FOLKS CAN DO WORK MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME CHECKS AND BALANCES WITH REGARDS TO HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING FLEXIBILITY HOW WE'RE MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW WE'RE NOT SORT OF OFFERING GREATER AUTHORITY TO DEPARTMENTS- WITHOUT THE NECESSARY CHECKS AND BALANCES- SO I SO I WOULD WELCOME THE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS THAT THE L. A. O. IS. A WILLING TO PRODUCE FOR US. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR CONCERNS I WANNA I WANNA SECOND DENT THAT- COMMENT- NO QUESTIONS. NO QUESTION THAT WE WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO START PERFORMING THE NEW DUTIES THAT WE'VE- DETERMINED ARE IMPORTANT- AND THERE'S NO REASON IT NEW TASK FOR SHOULD BE UNNECESSARILY DELAYED. OUT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS- PROVISION ONE- PROCESS JUST REQUIRES A LETTER TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND TO ME THAT DOESN'T SEEM OVERLY BURDENSOME BUT IF THERE'S SOME THAT IF THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES- I APPLIED THE L. A- FOR- HIT THE SUGGESTION THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT. ADD ON TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THINGS AND MORE THAT WE CAN STREAMLINE HOW WE WORK AND GIVE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S GOOD BUT- I THINK THERE WAS A REASON THIS WAS IMPOSED IN THE FIRST PLACE WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE NOT GETTING. JUST GETTING RID OF IT- FOR NO REASON SO- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ITEMS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD OPEN AND WE'LL WE'LL SEE THE LANGUAGE BACK AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON ON HOW THAT- SHOULD BE MANAGED. SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC. COMMENT SECTION.
