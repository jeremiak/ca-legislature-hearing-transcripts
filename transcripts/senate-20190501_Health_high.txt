THIS YEAR OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING ON SB. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WILL HELP PARENTS AND EDUCATORS IDENTIFY ELECTRIC CIGARETTES AND REDUCE THEIR USE BY STUDENTS THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT. A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION IMPORTANT GRAPH OF EACH TYPE OF DEVICE A CELL IN CALIFORNIA TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO POST THIS DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOGRAPH ON THE WEBSITE AND IT ALSO REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO NOTIFY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CHARTER SCHOOLS IMPAIRED ORGANIZATIONS THAT THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AS WELL DESPITE LAWS PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ELECTRONICS CIGARETTES TO PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS EACH. I AND THEIR USE IS RAPIDLY INCREASING ACCORDING TO A REPORT RELEASED BY THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND NOVEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN THREE POINT SIX MILLION. ARE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORT USING EAST DEVICES WITHIN THE PAST THIRTY DAYS. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS AS THE PREVIOUS YEAR. DEVICES PRODUCED IN RECENT YEARS HAVE GONE UNDER THE RADAR BECAUSE THEY LOOK VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE'RE USED TO IN PARTICULAR THE USB FLASH DRIVES. OR PENS THIS MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS AND EDUCATORS TO IDENTIFY THESE DEVICES HAVE BROUGHT TO SCHOOL OR A OR ANY OTHER PLACE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP THESE DEVICES OUT OF THE HANDS OF OUR STUDENTS THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPOSE A REASONABLE FEE. ON ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE MANUFACTURERS TO COVER THE DEPARTMENTS COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM. I AS A TEACHER MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU I'M NOT A SMOKER SO I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THIS DEVICE IS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE WHAT THEY ARE OR HOW THEY SMELL WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TO DO SOME OF MY WITNESSES. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS MERITED BURKE MAN CHRISTINE CHEST MEANT TO MEMBERS OF THAT GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION PARENTS AGAINST. VAPING E. CIGARETTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO SIX MINUTES TOTAL MAXIMUM BUT THE I THINK THE THANK YOU. MY NAME IS CHRISTINE CHESSON AND I'M WITH PARENTS AGAINST VAPING E. CIGARETTES A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT OF PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PROVIDING THE EPIDEMIC OF TEEN VAPING. BUT TODAY I MOSTLY HERE IS THE PARENTS. MY OWN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD SON IS NOW FACING NICOTINE ADDICTION THANKS TO DISCRETE APPEALING DEVICES POPULARIZED BY JEWEL. WHEN I FIRST FOUND THE SMALL PLASTIC CAP AN EMPTY CAPSULE IN MY SON'S ROOM? I THOUGHT THEY WERE SOMETHING LEFT VER FROM ONE OF HIS ELECTRONIC DEVICES OR PERHAPS THE PENCIL LEAD CASE OR CANDY CASE. IN A TEENAGE BOYS ROOM THERE'S LOTS OF AN IDENTIFIABLE TRASH AMONG PILES OF DIRTY CLOTHES AND PAPERS. YOU NEVER KNOW WITH WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. WHEN I FOUND THESE ITEMS AGAIN I CONFRONTED HIM AND THE TRUTH CAME OUT? THEIR CONSTANT USE OF THE SNEAKY EASILY HIDDEN DEVICES IS VIRTUALLY UNDETECTED BY TEACHERS AND PARENTS JUST LIKE ME AND SENATOR RUBIO. KIDS WERE WE LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVE TOLD US THAT IN SOME CASES UP 280% OF THEIR FRIENDS ARE REGULARLY USING FLAVORED E. CIGARETTES. IT'S NORMAL EVERYONE DOES IT THEY SAY. BIG TOBACCO HAS SNAPPED BACK INTO THE ADDICTION BUSINESS THROUGH THE TECH INDUSTRY SIDE DOOR LURING MILLIONS OF TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS DOWN THIS PROFITABLE PATH. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A KID WHO JULES IS FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BEGIN SMOKING REGULAR CIGARETTES THAN A KID WHO DOES NOT YOU'LL. HAD I KNOWN SOONER WITH THE SLEEK LITTLE PLASTIC CAPSULES AND TECH PRODUCTS WERE PERHAPS I COULD HAVE HELPED MY SON SOONER AND PREVENTED FULL BLOWN ADDICTION. FOR WHICH SHE IS NOW SEEKING TREATMENT. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SORRY. THANK YOU SIR MY NAME IS MEREDITH BERKMAN AND I'M A CO FOUNDER OF PARENTS AGAINST A. B. E. CIGARETTES -- AND AS PRISTINE SAID I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE MY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT I'M NOT HERE BECAUSE I'M GOVERNMENT OR POLITICS. I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M AN ACTIVATED MOTHER OF FOUR KIDS AND I STARTED THIS GROUP LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. BECAUSE I FOUND THAT MY SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD SON AND HIS FRIENDS WERE CHILLING AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS. AND IT'S A VERY COMMON STORY WE FOUND -- THESE PLASTIC CAPS WE FOUND CHARGERS THAT WE THOUGHT-WERE FROM TELEPHONES A FROM CELL PHONES AND WE WENT ONLINE AND BEGAN TO CONNECT THE DOTS IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR. THAT WE ARE FACING AND EXPERTS WILL WILL TELL YOU THE VOTE THE LARGEST ADOLESCENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS UP WE'VE HAD FOR DECADES. THIS IS AN AMAZING BILL BECAUSE IT IS SO INCREDIBLY PRACTICAL WE'RE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WERE YOU KNOW OPERATING HERE AND IN NEW YORK AND AND MANY OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND THE THING THAT PARENTS SAY TO US TIME AND AGAIN I WISH I'D KNOWN WHAT I WAS LOOKING. FOR I WISH I'D KNOWN WHEN I FOUND A CHARGER THAT WAS LARGER THAN NORMAL WHAT THAT WAS OR HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT IN HIS ROOM UNDER MY NOSE. I WAS THERE ALL THE TIME AND I DIDN'T SMELL ANYTHING I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING. WE GET CALLS FROM EDUCATORS. LIKE SENATOR RUBIO WE GET CALLS FROM PEDIATRICIANS AND THE SADDEST CALLS OF ALL COME FROM PARENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE BECAUSE THEIR KIDS ARE NOW ADDICTED TO NICOTINE. AND HAD THEY KNOWN WHAT THESE DEVICES LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY. PRACTICAL AND NONPARTISAN AND% URGENTLY NEEDED AND TIMELY BILL THAT WILL HELP OTHER PARENTS ALL OVER THE STATE SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING. FOR AND THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO. IF THEY HAVE A PROBLEM THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AFTER MY ROBINSON KAISER PERMANENTE IN SUPPORT. YOU. RECEBER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. RIGHT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A SINGING NUN QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER SIR GROWTH. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- I KNOW THE VAPING ISSUEIS JUST YOU KNOW HOT ON THE PRESS IS TODAY BUT SO I DID IT EASY GOOGLE SEARCH -- AND IT JUST ALL AS I TYPED IN WAS YOU KNOW VERY BEING AND IT SHOWED UP SET UP SO IN IT DID SHOW UP STUFF THAT LOOK LIKE A CHARGER LOOK LIKE A PAN. LOOK LIKE A LIKE A U. S. B. COR -- PORT LIKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD CARRY. SO I GUESS TWO QUESTIONS ONE IF YOU CAN DO A GOOD EASY GOOGLE SEARCH AND HAVE IT -- WHAT WHAT WHAT MAKES YOUR BILL DIFFERENT OTHER AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA REPORTED TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT I GUESS MY SECOND QUESTION A FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS? WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH GOING TO DO WITH IT? THAT WITH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WELL FIRST OF ALL THIS SUGGEST -- IS A BEGINNING OF AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND I'LL TELL YOU ANYBODY CAN GOOGLE SEARCH. BUT THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT ALL OF US ARE LOOKING I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN SO AS AN EDUCATOR I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT THAT THESE ITEMS EXISTED AGAIN UNLESS YOU'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING YOU WOULDN'T SEE IT. SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CAN PUT TOGETHER. A VISUAL EVERY TIME I NEW PRODUCT COMES TO THE MARKET THAT WE CAN SEND OUT -- TO TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND BY WAY OF THE IF EXAMPLE -- AS AN EDUCATOR WE HAVE STAFF MEETINGS EVERY WEEK AND SO ON MY HOPE IS THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE AMEND EVERY TIME THEY GO TO STAFF MEETING AND ANYTIME THAT THERE IS NOT A NEW DEVICE. THEY CAN -- MAKE SURE THAT EVERY TEACHER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK -- FOR SO SO THAT IT'S DIFFERENT AND NOT AGAIN WE'RE GONNA BE VERY SPECIFICALLY PUT IN THE INFORMATION THE HOUNDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT PASSED DOWN TO TEACHERS. AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WILL DO IS JUST. ADMINISTER THAT THAT THE PROGRAM IN TERMS OF PUTTING IT ON A WEBSITE AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS INFORMATION. SO ONCE IT'S GIVEN THIS PHOTOGRAPH FOR DESCRIPTION IS GIVEN TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE PUBLIC HEALTH US DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS GOING TO DISSEMINATE THAT DOWN TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS YES NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO WE HOPE THAT THEY HAVE A WEBSITE. PARTICULARLY GOING STRAIGHT TO TO TO BACK OR THEY CAN SEE THIS PRODUCT IN CASE ANYBODY WANTS. TO TO INQUIRE WE CAN REFER THEM TO A WEBSITE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] LEYVA. I SWEAR I THINK THE SENATOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC BILL. YOU KNOW AS WE GO THROUGH LIFE THINGS CHANGE WHEN MY GIRLS WERE LITTLE -- WE WENT TO A CLASS -- MY HUSBAND AND I AND OTHER PARENTS ON WHERE TO LOOK FOR DRUG PARAPHERNALIA -- THAT OUR KIDS COULD BE HIDING OR WHATNOT AND NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT VAPING AND THIS SORT OF THING SO I JUST APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS SO THAT WE KNOW AS PARENTS. AND WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE SAFE SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. I THINK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS A CENTER STONE THANK YOU -- SENATOR AND I'M ALSO -- VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE TO THE BILL -- TOO MANY YOUNG CHILDREN ARE. GETTING HOOKED ON NICOTINE AFTER DECADES OF SEEING A DECLINE -- BUT COULD YOU JUST ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. IN A PUBLIC HEALTH IS CAN BECOME THE BENEFICIARY OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING ON THE MARKET TO DELIVER NICOTINE -- COULD YOU SHOULD POINT TO ME IN YOUR BILL. THE THE LANGUAGE THAT MANDATES THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS TO COMMUNICATE THOSE IMAGES TO ALL THE TEACHERS WITHIN THE SCHOOL -- I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE JUST NOT. THROWING ANOTHER MANDATE OUT THERE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SENDS OUT THIS MASS EMAIL. WHICH IS ONE OF MANY HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROBABLY GET AND THEY JUST KIND OF PUSHED OFF THE SIDE OF A TAKE A SERIOUS HAVING SERIOUS ISSUE. AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL AS WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY. THAT IT REALLY BECOMES A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ENSURE THAT THEIR TEACHERS ARE AWARE OF THESE DIFFERENT NICOTINE DELIVERY MODALITIES. SO THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF IT THEY CAN SPOT IT AND THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO TRY. TO ALERT THE PARENTS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT -- I JUST WANNA JUST -- INSURER. OR AT LEAST GIVE YOU MY COMMAND THAT I'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IT'S REALLY TIGHT SO IT GETS DONE OF COURSE WHEN I IT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS BILL UP I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IT'S DONE WELL AND DOWN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN UP TAKE -- BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOBACCO CONTROL. PROGRAM SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A DIALOGUE AND FIGURE OUT TOGETHER WHAT. IS THE BEST I WAY FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE TAKEN CARE OF APPRECIATE IT WITH A BILL. OKAY THANK YOU SO THE MOTION BY CENTER STONE -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SEEN ON FIRST OF ALL I WOULD MAKE NOTE -- THAT -- THE BILL DOES STATE -- QUOTE THE DEPARTMENT CHAU CONDUCTED PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO NOTIFY SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PARENTS ASIANS THAT PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES ARE AVAILABLE ON INTERNET WEBSITES SO. I THINK THERE'S A DIRECTIVE TO THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH. TO INFORM -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND PAN ORGANIZATIONS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT THE INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AT THE THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH WEBSITE NATO AND ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT CERTAINLY -- YOU CAN CERTAINLY GOOGLE AND PICK UP IMAGES OF THESE DEVICES BUT IF YOU GOOGLE SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW WE GOT THE IMAGE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT DEVICES RIGHT SO I MEAN THEY'RE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING TO CHANGING -- AND FORTUNE WE DO KNOW -- THAT -- MANY OF THEM LOOK VERY MUCH LIKE OTHER COMMON THINGS LIKE USB DRIVES AND OTHER THINGS SO THEY'RE NOT IMMEDIATELY RECOGNISABLE SO I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE'S GONNA BE ONE PLACE. WHERE YOU CAN GO AND FIND THIS IT'S BECAUSE I THINK I GOOGLE I MAY FIND SOME DEVICES MAY NOT FIND OTHERS AND SO? BEING BEING IN ONE PLACE AND THEN HAVING THAT. PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN SO THAT PARENTS AND SCHOOL TEACHERS AND OTHERS CAN KNOW WHERE TO GO TO FIND THIS AND SAID HAVING TO SEARCH ON THEIR OWN HEY I SAW SOMETHING IS THAT SOMETHING -- I THINK IS REALLY GREAT SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING THIS BILL AND AND CERTAINLY -- VERY SUPPORT THE BILL. YES CENTERS CENTER STONE THE FIGURE RESEARCH HERE ON PAGE NINETY EIGHT I'M LOOKING AT LINES TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY SIX AND AND AGAIN I COMPLIMENT YOU ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING OUT TO DO PAGE. THREE OF YOUR BILL SB -- FIVE THIRTY WE WE BASICALLY HAVE AN HOUR EACH CAMPAIGN TO NOTIFY DISTRICTS THAT'S FINE IF YOU JUST TIGHTEN UP THAT LANGUAGE IN HEARING NEXT HEARING THAT. THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE TO DELIVER TO THE TEACHERS THE TEACHERS SEE THE IMAGE AND WHAT THEY DO WITH THE IMAGES BUT TO OUR SCHOOLS TEACHERS A I THOUGHT MAKE SURE DOESN'T FALL IN AN EMPTY. CATEGORY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF ALL PLUS FOR EMAILS EVERYBODY GETS COULD I THINK YOU'RE BILLS IMPORTANT I DON'T WANT. TO GET THERE. SENATOR STONE THANK YOU FOR THAT AS YOU'RE EXPRESSING AYE YOUR CONCERNS I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT AND DOWN I KNOW THAT THERE IS MANDATE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE POST ON STAFF LOUNGES FOR EXAMPLE OSHA AND YOU KNOW I LABOR REGULATIONS AND SO I THINK. I'M GOING TO ADD THAT PROVISION THAT THEY HAVE TO POSTED IN EVERY STAFF LOUNGE IN EVERY SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD. TAKE CARE OF YOUR CONCERN BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. NAY SAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS SO -- APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH CENTERS ON THAT BUT WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST REALLY QUICKLY YESTERDAY ANOTHER REPORT CAME OUT OF OTHER PRODUCTS AND I JUST SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE A A STAPLER. A FLASHLIGHT AND AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND AND AND I'M SORRY AS AN EDUCATOR I CAN TELL YOU THESE ARE ITEMS THAT WE PARTICULATE USE IN SCHOOLS AND SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS ARE EQUIPPED TO RECOGNIZE.

ALL RIGHT FIREFIGHTERS ITEM NUMBER TWO AS THESE THREE SEVENTY THREE OKAY WELCOME. I'M BACK WITH BLOCKCHAIN I LOVE BLOCKCHAIN. NOT BECAUSE I LOVE BLOCKCHAIN BUT BECAUSE I'M TRYING. TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MODERNIZE -- OUR GOVERNMENT WE HAVE A TECHNOLOGY WORLD THAT WE'RE SO PROUD OF AROUND THIS STAGE THAT'S MOVING AT BREAKNECK SPEED THAT'S IMPACTING GOVERNMENT IN SUCH A EXTRAORDINARY WAY AND I FIND THAT IT'S E. I'M TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE. WITH RESPECT -- TO AB ARE DROPPING MORE MODERN TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN -- GIVE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR WE DID THE SHAREHOLDERS. A BLOCKCHAIN MEASURE IN THIS YEAR -- WITH DEALING WITH MERIT CERTIFICATES CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS BY ADDING A SUNSET. OF JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BECAUSE BY THAT TIME THE WORLD WILL CHANGE IT AGAIN UNDER MURPHY'S LAW LIMITING THIS MEASURE JUST AMERICA TO FOR KIDS AND INCLUDING A REPORT BACK. FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP ABOUT ITS IMPACT WHICH I THINK I AM A MEMBER -- AGAIN -- I AM SURE THAT THIS ROOM AND MANY OF THIS ROOM HAD THE EXPERIENCE WHEN WE NEED A MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE FOR TAXES HEALTH BENEFITS ARE OTHERS. THAT OFTEN THE TIME DEADLINE WILL GET YOU THE DETAILS FROM THE WITNESSES HERE I DON'T TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME BUT IT'S CLUNKY. IS YESTERDAY'S NEWS IT'S HARD TO GO AND OFFICES TAKES A LOT OF TIME THE QUESTION IS CAN WE ADVANCE -- OUR TECHNOLOGY THE WAY TO MAKE IT EASIER AND SO WITH RESPECT TO MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES THAT'S WHAT THIS MEASURE NOW AS AMENDED -- DOES IT TAKE TAKE SEVEN TO TEN DAYS TO GET COPIES HERE SO THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY DYNAMIC EMERGING TECHNOLOGY THAT PEOPLE THINK GENERALLY IN THE CON LIMITED CONTEXT OF BITCOIN BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH CREATING A SECURE. INTERNET REALLY THE NEXT GENERATION OF MAKING SURE THAT RECORDS ARE SECURE AND HERE IN AN AREA OF THE LAW WHERE WHERE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE TRYING TO APPLY THAT TECHNOLOGY. HERE MY WITNESSES TODAY. TO MAKE THIS FAST OUR ALLEY MEDINA -- WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN ADVOCACY GROUP AND ROB. GROSS. BLOGGER ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY RECORDER'S ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I REMEMBER ONCE A START FIRST THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU AND WE HAVE SIX MINUTES FOR BOTH OF THESE CELL. OKAY SHORTER THAN THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REYES ROB CHRIS CLOSER WITH THE COUNTY RECORDER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA BY PRESIDENT ON A JOHNSON US -- APOLOGIZE THAT SHE CANNOT BE HERE SHE INJURED HER KNEE AND AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW SO WHICH I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND -- THE COUNTY RECORDER'S ARE THE CUSTODIANS OF OUR RECORDS -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE CONSIDER THAT -- SENSE OF PRIDE IN OUR RECORDS DATE BACK TO THE GOLD RUSH ERA WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING THOUGH ACCESS THE RECORDS THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND REALLY APPRECIATE CENTER HERTZBERG INTRODUCING THE BILL -- WE CURRENTLY UTILIZE BANK NOTE PAPER SO IT'S A SECURE PAPER THAT CANNOT BE. ALTERED OR CHANGED OR REPRODUCED AND WE'VE SEEN OTHER JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS ABOUT A USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO ISSUE A SIMILAR TYPE OF DOCUMENT THAT CANNOT BE ALTERED -- I WILL LEAVE THE EXPERT A BLOCKCHAIN TO MY LEFT HERE FOR FOR THOSE COMMENTS BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS NOW CURRENTLY IS IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY COME DOWN TO OUR OFFICE YOU COME DOWN TO GET A COPY VITAL RECORD AN OLD PRINTER WITH A FEW MINUTES AND IT'S YOURS. YOU CAN WALK OUT THE DOOR IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO DO SO YOU CAN -- ACTUALLY GET A NOTARY THE THOUGHT OF FORM FAX IN AS A SENATOR SAID WAIT SEVEN TODAY TEN DAYS TO GET IT IN THE MAIL -- THAT'S NOT A VERY EFFICIENT PROCESS WHEN FOLKS ESPECIALLY USING MEASURE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE OUR NAMES AT DMV OR OTHERS AREAS SO WE BE THIS IS A CUSTOMER SERVICE OPPORTUNITY MY STILL MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE DOCUMENTS AND THE SECURITY OF THEM -- WE DO KNOW FROM THE WASH YOU COUNTY -- SITUATION OR A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN MARRIED IN RENO AND THAT WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA DMV OFFICES ACCEPTING THE WASHER COUNTY BLOCK CHAINS -- IT'S AN INFORMAL SURVEY SO WE CAN IT NOTED -- BUT WE DO HAVE HEARD SUCCESS STORIES ALREADY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND TO GIVE YOUR CONSIDERATION. HELLO THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M I'M ALLEY MEDINA I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE BLOCKCHAIN ASK THE COALITION -- WE SUPPORT SMART BLOCKCHAIN REGULATION AND GOOD USE CASES THE BLOCKCHAIN FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD ACTUALLY USE. A BLOCKCHAIN THAT WILL INCREASE THE SECURITY AND EFFICIENCY FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS I THINK ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN IS LIKE WHAT IS THIS BEYOND BIT COIN. AND IS THIS REALLY SECURE AND YES IT IS I'M PRIMARILY THE WAY WE STORE DATA RIGHT NOW IS HIGHLY CENTRALIZED THE CLOUD IS JUST A BUNCH OF SERVER FARMS YOU'VE GOT THEM ON FIRE YOU LOSE ALL THE DATA -- THEY CAN BE HACKED WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF A VERY BIG PUBLIC HACKS RECENTLY CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUALS RECORDS. LAST YEAR MY FITNESS PAL A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. RECORDS OF HOW MANY STEPS YOU TOOK IN A DAY THEY KNOW NOW -- THE GREAT THING ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN IS THAT A DECENTRALIZED AS THE INFORMATION AND MAKES IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT TASK -- WASHOE COUNTY USES TIGHTEN SEAL WHICH IS RUN ON THE THEORY I'M BLOCKCHAIN THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF USERS OF THE ASSYRIAN BLOCKCHAIN MEANING IT'S HIGHLY DECENTRALIZED HAS NEVER BEEN HACKED. BY DESIGN WOULD BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO HACK. CURRENTLY IF YOU WANTED TO YOU KNOW FIND BIG NO PAPER AND PHOTO SHOP IT THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BUT LESS DIFFICULT THAN HACKING THE ASSYRIAN BLOCKCHAIN THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ADDED SECURITY. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS -- IT IS IN ADDITION OTHER COUNTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS ARE USING THIS UKRAINE SUITE IN. THE STATE OF VERMONT ARE ALL USING A BLOCKCHAIN FOR LAND TITLE AND FOR A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE A SECURE IT IS EFFICIENT. AND IT IS THE BETTER SERVICE FOR THEIR CITIZENS OF THE UNITED NATIONS USES ITS RIGHT FOOD VOUCHERS FOR REFUGEES TWO THOUSAND TEN AND TO START TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE PROVIDED VOUCHERS FOR TEN THOUSAND REFUGEES. IN CAMPS IN SYRIA -- IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THE REASON IT'S RUN ENTIRE CAMPS IN JORDAN NOW AND ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT VIA THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM SO THIS IS A TEST TO TECHNOLOGY BY GOVERNMENTS AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. THAT IS SECURE AND EXCELLENT FOR PROVIDING IDENTITY IDENTITY VERIFIED INFORMATION WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES WE THINK SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WE THINK YOU SAYS RECORDERS FOR SUPPORTING THAT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BACK MICROPHONE PLEASE. JUST OF TRICKLE FROM BED AML IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ALEX IS A FROM SACRAMENTO BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT AT THE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SAYING NINE A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT. OKAY A C. -- NINE SERVERS AYE THANK YOU MUCH SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH -- OUR COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE I THOUGHT THAT -- GOOD TO START OFF FIRS WITH THE MERIT CERTIFICATES AND BE SURE THAT -- THAT GOES WELL AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT BIRTH AND DEATH CERTIFICATES ARE LITTLE MORE FINAL -- SO -- AND I THINK -- CERTAINLY IF WE PROVE THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES AND OF PEOPLE USING THAT LIKE THIS TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER PLACES I THINK THAN. I THINK IT RAISES THE COMFORT LEVEL TO THEN -- DEAL WITH THOSE AS I APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO -- I KNOW THAT -- YOU THE GROUP THAT YOU ACTUALLY SERVING ON WILL BE COMING UP OF THE REPORT SO I THINK THAT'S CAN ALSO BE VERY INFORMERS WELL AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE EXPAND USING THIS TECHNOLOGY -- BUT CERTAINLY IMPROVING ACCESS TO THESE DOCUMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT -- I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BRING FORWARD SO WITH THAT. OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED THANK YOU I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE.

FOUR THIRTY EIGHT EXCELLENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. FIRST LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT WERE WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. RAISED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. WHY DID I INTRODUCED THIS BILL AND WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO CHIEF? WE'VE LEARNED IN MANY INSTANCES WHERE BECAUSE THEY'RE A MERGING SHE SERVICES FOR AMBULANCE IN THE LIKE IS CONTRACTED OUT THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS. THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST LICENSE RIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES TODAY IN A MUCH MORE ELOQUENT WAY THAT I COULD ARTICULATE. WHY THIS MEASURE IS SO IMPORTANT? BUT THEY WILL TALK ABOUT. A HAVING PUBLIC ENTITIES ENSURING THAT A PUBLIC ENTITY A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE OR A PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIAL IS BEST SUITED TO BE THE ONE IN CHARGE. OF WHO DECIDES WHAT ENTITY WITH ITS PRIVATE OR PUBLIC WHATEVER THE ENGINEERS THAT IS SENT TO AN EMERGENCY SCENE. IS IN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE PERSON WHO ARRIVES TO THE SCENE OF AN EMERGENCY WILL DO THE BEST JOB THEY POSSIBLY CAN THE QUESTION. IS WHETHER THE PERSON EVEN GETS THE CALL TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE IN A TIMELY MANNER WE HAD SEEN WHICH YOU WILL HEAR TODAY GET A LEAVE IT TO THEM. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE SO THAT IS WHY WE'VE INTRODUCED SB UP FOR THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WILL PROHIBIT A PUBLIC AGENCY FROM OUTSOURCING ITS LOCAL. EMERGENCY DISPATCH SERVICES TO A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT IT'S T. EXCEPT UNDER VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AND ONE OTHER THING I HAD BEFORE I TURN IT OVER MY RICH TEAMS -- WITNESSES WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON AMENDMENTS TO GO UP A TO GRANDFATHER THE EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS IN FRESNO COUNTY TO ENSURE CONTINUED OPERATIONS UNDER THAT EXISTING CONTRACT. BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT FRESNO'S FIRE DEPARTMENTS ARE EMPOWERED TO DETERMINE THE RESOURCE DEPLOYMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY MEET OR EXCEED THE MEDICAL CONTROL POLICIES. ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNTY HERE WITH ME TODAY IS THE PRESIDENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS ASSOCIATION. BRIAN RICE. AND JEFF -- MESSIN PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WITH A NUMBER OF THEIR COLLEAGUES. ONLY A PICTURE THIS HERE IN IT IN THE HEARING ROOM AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO PRESIDENT RICE. THANK YOU -- SO WELCOME AND SIX MINUTES BOTH OF YOU TOGETHER -- HERTZBERG [inaudible] CHAIRMAN. IN ORDER PAN AND THE HONORABLE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEING ABLE TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU. MY NAME IS BRIAN RICE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. I'VE BEEN A THIRTY ONE YEAR VETERAN THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE IN HAVE SERVED IN THE FRONT LINES ANDALSO AS A DEPUTY CHIEF OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN FIRE DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. MOST SACRED MISSION F GOVERNMENT AT ANY LEVEL IS PROTECTING THE LIVES IN THE HEALTH OF ITS PEOPLE. FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DECADES THAT MISSION HAS INCLUDED PROVIDING FAST EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE RESPONSE. THE FIRST IN OFTEN NOT OFTEN THE FIRST IN ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL LIFE AND DEATH RESPONSIBILITIES FOR NINE ONE ONE IS OUR DISPATCH. WHEN SECONDS COUNT IT'S A SWORN DUTY OF PUBLIC FIRE AGENCIES TO DEPLOY THE CLOSEST AND FASTEST RESPONSE POSSIBLE THEY'RE THE MOST DIRECT AN ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC SAFETY PROVIDERS SENATE BILL? FOR THIRTY EIGHT ENSURES THAT THAT SECRET RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT PASSED OFF OR COMPROMISED BY MOTIVATIONS OTHER THAN WHAT MATTERS MOST IN THAT IS PATIENT CARE. UNDER SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT PUBLIC AGENCIES WILL BE PREVENTED FROM DIRECTLY OUTSOURCING THIS CORE PUBLIC SAFETY FUNCTION TO PRIVATE FOR PROFIT ENTITIES. IF SUCH SERVICES ARE TO BE CONTRACTED IT CAN ONLY BE TO ANOTHER PUBLIC ENTITY OR TO A JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT INVOLVING ALL THE AFFECTED PUBLIC AGENCIES SUCH AGREEMENTS EXIST TODAY AND ARE. PROTECTED BY THIS MEASURE. IN RECOGNITION THE CORE MISSION OF PUBLIC SAFETY IN SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT DEMANDS THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF RESPONSE FROM PUBLIC AGENCIES. AFTER ALL. WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO THE PUBLIC AND THE TAXPAYERS FOR WHOM WE SERVE. BY CONTRAST PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INTO BE ENTITIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR OWNERS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS. KIND OF SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE UTILITY INDUSTRY TODAY. THIS CREATES A POTENTIAL FOR MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED ON KOSTER PROFIT RATHER THAN THE URGENT NEED TO THE PATIENTS FEW PUBLIC AGENCIES OF TAKING THE RISKY STEP OF PRIVATIZING THEIR NINE ONE ONE DISPATCH CENTERS. IN SITUATIONS WHERE IT IS HAPPENED THE RESULTS OF PROVEN DISASTROUS I KNOW YOU HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOTHING TO SHIELD PUBLIC AGENCIES THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MEDICAL CONTROL POLICIES REQUIRED BY THEIR LOCAL. ANSES EMS AGENCIES. IT SIMPLY RECOGNIZES THAT ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC AGENCIES MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DISPATCH IN RESPONSE MODES AT BEST PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES. EVERY DISPATCHING RESOURCE MODE MUST ALWAYS MEET OR EXCEED THE LANCER LOCAL EMSA MEDICAL CONTROL POLICIES. AS FIREFIGHTERS EMS IS A CORE PART OF OUR FUNCTION YOU SIMPLY DON'T WORK AS A FIREFIGHTER IN THE STATE UNLESS YOU'RE AT A MINIMUM ANY EMPTY BASIC LIFE SUPPORT. IN LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS IT'S ALL ABOUT DEPLOYING RAPID RESPONSE. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL AGENCIES FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN. SHOULD NOT BE CHECKED OFF TO ANYBODY'S BOTTOM LINE ON BEHALF OF THE THIRTY THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BY VOTE ON SB. FOUR THIRTY EIGHT AND MY TURN IT OVER. THE ONE THING I WANTED TO SAY. IT'S INTERESTING HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THE VERY TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT THAT. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT OPERATES IN THE COUNTY SACRAMENTO RECEIVED A A OPPOSITION LETTER. FROM THE COUNTIES GOVERNMENT A FAIR FAIRS OFFICER IN SOME OF THE THINGS I'M HEARING IS THAT THIS IS A JOB KILLER. IT IS NOT THE CASE IN SACRAMENTO THERE'S A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN RESPONSE IN EACH OF THE PRIVATE AMBULANCE COMPANIES HAVE THEIR OWN DISPATCH TO HANDLE INNER FISCALLY TRANSPORTS HOME TO FROM FROM. THE HALL FACILITY TO HOME TRANSPORTERS A WHOLE SECTION OF THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NINE ONE ONE SERVICE DELIVERY AND I AM COMMITTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DISPATCH -- IN FRESNO. IS UNAFFECTED IN LESS THAT COMMUNITY DECIDES TO DO A DIFFERENT MODEL IN I CAN GET VERY PASSIONATE I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEVEN AND A HALF NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN PAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JEFF MASSON AND I SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. OUR MEMBERS REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF DELIVERY MODELS OF FIRE EMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES FOR COMMUNITIES. WHAT TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT WHY WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS TO CO SPONSOR CENTER HERTZBERG SPELL? THE BILL IS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IT WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THE HIGHEST VESSELS OF SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. INDEED THIS WILL BILL WILL PREVENT HARM THAT IS A CURRENT MAKING IT CLEAR THAT COUNTY EMS AGENCIES CANNOT DICTATE WERE FAR BASICALLY A MACHINIST CANNOT CANNOT BE DISPATCHED TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL. IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. EVEN WHEN EMS UNITS ARE CLOSER AND THEY CAN GET THERE FASTER SOME COUNTY AGENCIES HAVE ENACTED POLICIES IN HIS TRUCK PRIVATE CONTRACTED DISPATCH SERVICES TO DELAY OR COMPLETELY WITHHOLD MY ONE ONE CALL. DATA FROM FAR AGENCIES ON EMERGENCIES WITHIN CITIES OR FIRE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. LET ME FOCUS BRIEFLY ON TO TERMS AND SHALL HEAR ABOUT TODAY THE FIRST TOMB IS MEDICAL CONTROL THE TERM REFERS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY'S MEDICAL DIRECTOR'S. HAS OVER THE MEDICAL DECISIONS AND CARE RENDERED AT THE TIME A DISPATCH IN THE FIELD DURING EMS RESPONSE. THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COUNTY'S ROLE IN PROVIDING MEDICAL CONTROL OF PMS SERVICES. THE BILL DOES NOT WAIVE THE REQUIREMENT OF EMS DISPATCH PROTOCOLS THAT WE MUST BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE COUNTY'S MEDICAL DIRECTOR. NOR DOES HIS BILL CHANGE AFFECTED EMS DISPATCHER OPERATOR MUST HAVE A BOARD CERTIFIED MEDICAL DIRECTOR RESPONSIBLE FOR MEDICAL OVERSIGHT. THE SECOND TERM IS SYSTEMS INTEGRATION WE AGREE THAT PRE HOUSE WILLIAM AS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED NOTHING IN THIS BILL AUTHORIZES NOT FAR AGENCY TO OPERATE OUTSIDE. OF INTEGRATED COUNTY Y. DMS SYSTEMS LIKE ALL PUBLIC SERVICES FROM CITIES AND SERVICE AREAS MAY BE ABLE TO DELIVER A HIGHER LEVEL OF EMS TO THE RESIDENTS THAN OTHERS. BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THE COUNTY'S ROLE TO DELIBERATELY AND UNILATERALLY DEPRESSED SERVICE DELIVERY AND ONE COMMUNITY SO THAT THE UNITS CAN BE DEPLOYED SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THAT COUNTY. THE TRUCE IS -- IN SOME COUNTY SYSTEMS THEY'RE NOT INTEGRATED A BECAUSE DISPATCH INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN SURE WITH EMS PROVIDERS AT THE SAME TIME THIS MEANS IN NO WAY ENSURING THE CLOSEST AVAILABLE UNITS BE ABLE TO DISPATCH TO A CALL. WE BELIEVE SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT IS RESULTS OF MORE INTEGRATED SYSTEM THAT DELIVERS THE FASTEST POSSIBLE RESPONSE WITH THE SAME EXACT FOR LIFEGUARDS THAT CAN HELP WITH MEDICAL CONTROL. TODAY WE HAVE -- TREATY CHIEF BRADLEY AND STOCKTON CHIEF ERIC NEWMAN HERE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY WAS THE EPICENTER AND HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST DECADE.

WELCOME SO -- SINCE THE PROPONENTS WENT OVER TIME I WILL GIVE YOU SEVEN MINUTES SINCE THAT'S PRICING TIME THEY SPENT AS WELL -- BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL OF THE YOU DON'T WANT. TO THANK YOU MISTER SENATOR I'M FAIR MCDADE TEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I'M ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE THE COUNTIES YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THIS BILL AND AND WE REGRETFULLY MUST OPPOSE AS BEFORE THIRTY EIGHT WE KNOW SENATOR HERTZBERG. AND THE FINE PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- HAVE ONE VIEW ON THE BILL. FOR COUNTIES WE SERVE -- COUNTY WIDE OUR LOCAL EMERGENCY SERVICES ADMINISTRATORS TO OF WHICH I HAVE HERE WITH ME -- SERVE THE COUNTY WIDE AND THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A PATCHWORK IN WHICH A CITY OR FIRE DISTRICT WOULD BE DO BE DOING THE DISPATCH BUT THE REST OF THE COUNTY WOULDN'T BE COVERED. AND WHAT OUR ROLE IS AS COUNTIES IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTIRE COUNTY HAS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICE. COUNTY WIDE IN SOME CASES THE SECONDARY DISPATCH IS DONE BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ON VERY WELL IN OTHER CASES IS DONE BY JPA OR EVEN ON INDEPENDENT OR PRIVATE CONTRACTOR. UNDER ALL THOSE CASES THERE UNDER THE AUTHORITY AND OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE LAMBS Là TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ADHERE TO ALL RULES AND REGULATIOS UNDER IT FOR MEDICAL CONTROL RESPONSE TIMES AND OTHER THINGS. THIS IS THE WAY WE KNOW THAT THEIR DISPATCHING CORRECTLY WE ALSO THE COUNTIES ARE UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES OR THE THIRTY AT THE STATE LEVEL AND SO WE HAVE THESE LAYERS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A PATCHWORK AND SO. IF A CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE ABLE TO DO THEIR OWN DISPATCH ARE COUNTIES WOULD BE STRUGGLING TO ENSURE THAT THERE BE SERVICES SURROUNDING THAT CITY IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST REFER REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. HELLO -- I'M MY NAME IS DOCTOR CATHERINE SHE FUHRMAN PRACTICING EMERGENCY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO THE M. AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY -- I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE EMS MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. NO MATTER HOW IT HAS BEEN FRAME THIS BILL CLEARLY ELIMINATES THE AUTHORITY OF THE LOCAL EMUS MEDICAL DIRECTORS WHICH IS A PUBLIC ENTITY. TO MANAGE IMPROVING CORRECT MEDICAL DISPATCH MEDICAL DISPATCH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE MS SYSTEM AND SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED FROM THE OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL EMS MEDICAL DIRECTORS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT LOCAL EMS AGENCIES MUST ADHERE TO STRINGENT MEDICAL CONTROL STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE EMS OF THE AUTHORITY WHEN AN ACTING LOCAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. INCLUDING THOSE THAT GOVERN MEDICAL DISPATCHING RESPONSE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW PUBLIC AGENCIES TO OPERATE MEDICAL DISPATCH WITHOUT A HEARING TO ESTABLISH MEDICAL CONTROL STANDARDS. THIS MEANS ERRORS MADE BY PUBLIC DISPATCH AGENCIES WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THEM M. AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR OVERSIGHT REMEDIATION MEANING AN INDEPENDENT DOCTOR WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ENSURE PROPER MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE BEING INSTRUCTED BY DISPATCH. THE LOCAL EMS AGENCY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASSURE APPROPRIATE PRE HOSPITAL RESOURCES ARE DISPATCHED THE LOCAL EMS AGENCY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF RESPONSE TIMES ARE APPROPRIATE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM THROUGH REMEDIATING ERRORS ENCOUNTERED WITHIN MEDICAL. DISPATCH FOR EXAMPLE -- TODAY WHEN ERRORS ARE MISSTEPS ARE IDENTIFIED WHETHER BY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE PROVIDERS THE LOCAL EMS AGENCY UNDER GUIDANCE OF THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR EVALUATES THE INCIDENT AND TAKES CORRECTIVE STEPS IS NECESSARY WHICH MAY INCLUDE POLICY CHANGES. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EDUCATION AND IF WARRANTED DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS BY EXEMPTING PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM THE OVERSIGHT OF THE M. AS MEDICAL DIRECTOR. THESE AGENCIES SUCH AS A FIRE DEPARTMENT MADE A POINT AND REDEPLOY ITS RESOURCES AS IT SEES FIT WITHOUT MEDICAL DIRECTION. SB FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY BY PROHIBITING EMUS AGENCY MEDICAL DIRECTORS FROM THE PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT. OF THE MEDICAL CALL CROSSING PROCESSING MEDICAL DISPATCH AND MEDICAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION IN ADDITION THE BILL TIES THE HANDS OF COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND PREVENTS THEM FROM IMPLEMENTING. THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS. THIS WILL CAUSE HARM TO THE CITIZENS TO CALL GET REGRESSION THE EVOLUTION OF NINE ONE AM PATIENT CARE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAN BURCH I'M REPRESENTING THE INVESTMENTS TRADERS. OF CALIFORNIA. THE CENTRAL TENETS OF THE EMS ACT IN THE WAR NINE ONE ONE ACT OR THE CREATION OF PLANNED CENTRALIZED IN INTEGRATED EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEMS. THAT SIMPLIFY THE PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES IN IMPROVES THE SPEED AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RESPONSE. SB FOUR FOUR THIRTY EIGHT REJECTS THIS. SB FOUR THIRTY WILL DISMANTLE EXISTING CENTRALIZED MEDICAL PEACE SAP SUCH AS THOSE SERVING SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY STANISLAUS COUNTY MERCED COUNTY AND TULARE COUNTY. AND WILL STOP LOCAL EMS AGENCIES FROM CREATING ANY CENTRALIZED MEDICAL DISPATCH CENTERS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF TAKING AWAY OUR MEDICAL CONTROL AUTHORITY OVER DISPATCH. THE STATEMENTS BY THE BILL'S SPONSORS MIX. MISS CHARACTERIZE THE PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION OF THE MESSAGE WAS BY LOCALLY MISS AGENCIES. AS AN EXAMPLE. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY EMS AGENCY AT THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS REDESIGNED ITS EMS SYSTEM TO CREATE AN EXCLUSIVE OPERATING AREA FOR AMBULANCE SERVICE. IT IS AS A SINGLE PUBLIC. SAFETY ANSWERING POINT TO WRITE EMERGENCY MEDICAL DISPATCH. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY. ELIMINATE BLAME GAMES BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AMOS PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DISPATCH CENTERS. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. FOR PATIENTS THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE CLOSEST AMBULANCE. IS ALWAYS DISPATCH THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL JURISDICTION. WHAT COLOR THE AMBULANCES WERE WHAT UNIFORM THEY'RE WEARING? THIS GOES AWAY WHEN WE LOSE MEDICAL CONTROL THE DISPATCH SYSTEM. TODAY IS DESIGNED EACH LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIMARY PIECE SEVEN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY ROUTES NINE ONE CALLERS REQUESTING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THE COUNTY'S MEDICAL DISPATCH CENTER. THE MEDICAL DISPATCH CENTER FOLLOWS LOCALLY MISSING SUPER POLICIES THE TERMINATOR THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL EMERGENCY IMMEDIATELY INITIATE FIRST RESPONSE TREATMENT BY INSTRUCTING CALLERS. TO PERFORM LIFESAVING INTERVENTION SUCH AS CPR STOPPING PATIENTS FROM LEADING OUT IN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION. INSTRUCTING CHILDBIRTH WHICH WE ALL HEAR ON THE NEWS REGULARLY WHERE SOMEONE HAS A MEDICAL CALL TAKER FALLING MEDICAL DIRECTION OF PHYSICIAN. HAS TAUGHT SOMEBODY TO DELIVER BABIES. JUST HAPPEN TO THE SEATS FOR BOTH THE NICE TRAINS EACH P. OFFICER THEY WILL HELP SOMEBODY HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- RECENTLY JUST TO DO THAT BUT IT ALSO HAPPENS THROUGH NINE ONE CALL SYSTEMS. SEVEN CAN COUNTY IS FACE LAWSUITS OVER ITS INTEGRATED EMS SYSTEM DESIGN INCLUDING THE USE OF PRIVATE MEDICAL DISPATCH CENTERS. THE COURTS FOUND THAT THE POLICIES ADOPTED BY THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR WERE ADOPTED FOR MEDICAL REASONS. FOR INTENDED TO IMPROVE SPEED AND EFFECTIVENESS OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. STRENGTH IN THE COUNTY EMS AGENCIES OVERSIGHT OF MARINES MEDICAL DISPATCH ENHANCE ANIMALS PROVIDER ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IN PROVIDE FOR MORE EFFECTIVE QUALITY ASSURANCE. THOSE ARE THE COURT'S FINDINGS. THE COMMENTS MADE BY THE BILL'S SPONSORS THAT LOCALLY MESS AGENCIES THAT TO THE DESIGN EMS SYSTEMS USING A PRIVATE IN ANY. FORM NINE ONE MEDICAL DISPATCH ARE PLACING PROFITS BEFORE PATIENTS IN REDUCING SERVICES IN CREATING FELLING SYSTEMS WE HAVE TO GRAPH MALICIOUS INACCURATE. IN SUMMARY I'D LIKE JUST TO POINT OUT IF YOU READ. THE LAST PART ON PAGE FOUR OF THE AMENDED BILL. IT SAYS THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY MAY VOLUNTARILY CONSENT TO FOLLOW POLICIES. VOLUNTARY CONSENT IS NOT MEDICAL DIRECTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MICROPHONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STRONG HENSCHEL HERE ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE REGRETTABLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT. CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORS ARE ON GOING AND WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT A COMPROMISE CAN BE REACHED HERE SOON WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BETSY ARMSTRONG ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION. THE SHERMAN OTHER MEMBERS POLIO -- BEHALF OF THE COUNTIES OF STANISLAUS SAN JOAQUIN SISKIYOU -- AND FRESNO I THINK THE AUTHOR -- FOR APPARENTLY EXEMPTING FRESNO AND I THINK THE AUTHOR OF FOR EXEMPTING CINNAMON THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE -- BUT WE STILL DO HAVE THREE COUNTIES THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO LARRY COUNTIES IMPOSE BILLS LIKE THIS IN THE PAST SO THEY'RE STILL LITTLE WORK TO DO BUT LOOK FOR TO THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AUDREY RETIRED CHECK ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. SEVEN ANDERSON ON WE HAVE THE SAN MATTEO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. OKAY -- ARE THE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS A CENTER GROVE A REMIX. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- SO IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED WOULD PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES BE PERMITTED TO ACT OUTSIDE OF THE MEDICAL CONTROL OF THE LOCAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. AGENCY. OR MEDICARE'S PRODUCTIVITY. CHRISTIE OR THERE ARE EXPERT A GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAIL Là. JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY TO DO THAT ONE SHOULD ANSWER JUST QUESTION I DID HEAR THE QUESTION IF THIS BILL SO IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. WITH THE PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES DOING THE NINE ONE ONE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT. 90% OF THAT IS DONE BY PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES ARE CORRECT. SO IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED DOES IT CHANGE ANYTHING THAT IS DIFFERENT. WITH DOES EVERYTHING STAY THE SAME LIKE RIGHT NOW I KNOW NINE ONE ONE I HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH CHRIS YESTERDAY WE ALL KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND THEM PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT NINE ONE ONE YOU KNOW I THINK SHOULD PROBABLY BE UNDER A PUBLIC SERVICE AGENCY PURVIEW. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT IT DOES TAKE THE MEDICAL CONTROL AWAKE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY. AM I AM CONCERNED WHICH I DIDN'T HEAR YESTERDAY S. ABOUT AS THE THE PATCHWORK SCENARIO WHERE THE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT BILL TO DISPATCH FOR LEASE COUNTY OUTSIDE THE REAL COUNTY AREA SUBJECT. TO NOT THE SAME THINGS BUT MY% UNDERSTANDING IS IT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO AND IS THAT NOT CORRECT. SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE CALL COMES IN WE'RE A HOW THE PROCESS HAPPENS IF SOMEONE CALLS AND I WANTED TO BE THE GHOST OF POLICE DEPARTMENT IS TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR COUNTY. TWO DIFFERENT DISPATCH CENTER WITH A PROCESS THE CALL THE TIME WE SET TAKES PLACE WE DON'T KNOW WE GET VIA CAD TWO CAD LINK. THAT INFORMATION TO OUR DISPATCH CENTER WE HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF A DISPATCH PROCESS AS THE OTHER COUNTY DOES-- BUT WE DON'T GET THE LIVE COLOR WHICH GIVES US THE INABILITY TO HAVE THAT SOMETIMES PERTINENT INFORMATION DURING OUR RESPONSE -- WITHOUT HAVING THAT -- THAT LIVE COLOR IT REALLY AT IT IF IT. TAKES AWAY OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICES SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. WE COULD DISPATCH RIGHT NOW FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTY FTP BUT AT THIS TIME BY PROCESS WE DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY NOW WE DO STILL FALL UNDER MEDICAL FORTY UNDER OUR TO PLAN FOR EMS UNDER OUR DISPATCH SYSTEM WE REPORT. ANYTIME THAT WE HAVE EM D. TYPE CALLS ARE CALLS FOR SERVICE THAT REQUIRE EMS RESPONSE REPORT THAT TO OUR LIVES ARE SO THE SYSTEM PROCESS WHEN IT CHANGED THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE. WHO HAS THE LIVE CALLER? OKAY SO RIGHT NOW LIKE I SAID CONTROLLED BY AND BY FIREFIGHTERS OR PEOPLE IN PUBLIC SERVICE RIGHT IT'S FRESNO WHEN A FEW EXEMPTIONS. UNDER THAT SCENARIO RIGHT NOW THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT YOU DON'T GET THE LIVE CALL DIRECT ANYONE TO LIVE CALL YOU LIKE A LOT OF COLOR IN GETTING THE LIVE CALL SORRY. AND GETTING THE LIVE CALL WILL YOU STILL BE UNDER THE MEDICAL PER VIEW OF THE COUNTY AUTHORITY TO WHERE THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON YES HOUSE. WE HAVE A MEDICAL DIRECTOR THAT OVERSEES ALL MEDICAL OPERATIONS WITHIN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY THEY SAID THE POLICY THE PRACTICE WHAT TYPE OF AN EMT STRUCTURE WE HAVE. WHAT TYPE OF THE SYSTEM WE USE OUR CABS SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED ALL THAT IS UNDER THEIR THEIR REGULATION WE REPORT TO THEM ON A MONTHLY BASIS MANY SPECIFIC FINDINGS IN REGARDS TO EMS? SO IT THE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE SYSTEM WOULD BE THE LIVE CALL IN A LIVE CALL WOULD NOT BE TRANSFERRED TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR COUNTY TO A PRIVATE DISPATCH CENTER HE LEFT IN OUR COUNTY. FOR OUR RESOURCES TO TO BE DEPLOYED THEN. SO CAN I GET A RESPONSE BECAUSE THIS OKAY WE HAVE ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THAT I REALLY THINK THAT NINE ONE ONE BELONGS IN A PUBLIC AGENCY I DO -- I DO BUT I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND LOSING THAT AND ESPECIALLY THE PATCHWORK EFFECT BECAUSE I'VE BIG CITIES BUT I GOT I GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE NEEDLES I GOT A NEEDLE THERE IS ON THE BORDER RIGHT AND THERE'S OT BIG CITIES DOWN. THERE SO I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR PIECE -- YES MR TURNED ME OUT VERY DATING ON BEHALF OF C. SACK AGAIN AND THOSE ARE HAT'S THE CORE OF OUR CONCERN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT COUNTY WIDE. AND CURRENTLY THAT AUTHORITY -- AND AND KATHLEEN HERE DOCTOR CONFIRM IS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND SO. THE THE GENTLEMAN IS CORRECT THAT THEY DO SERVE UNDER THE MEDICAL CONTROL AND REPORT THESE THINGS TO THE COUNTY CURRENTLY UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO EXEMPT THEMSELVES FROM THAT AND THAT LAST CLAUSE WE MENTIONED IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL MORE OPEN TO TALKING WITH THE SPONSORS ABOUT AMENDMENTS -- ALLOWS OF IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD SAVE VOLUNTARILY NO WE DON'T WANT IT HERE TO THAT -- WE DON'T NEED TO WE MAY REPORT SOME THINGS OR YOU MAY REPORT ALL BUT IT REALLY TAKES WITH THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF HAVING A DOCTOR HAVE OVERSIGHT ON THE SYSTEM. YES MA'AM -- SO ERRORS WILL HAPPEN ERRORS DO HAPPEN THEY HAPPEN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DISPATCH. AND THE CONCERN IS THAT WHEN IT'S BEING DEALT WITH ONLY BY THAT ENTITY THAT'S DOING THE DISPATCH THAT THAT TRUE OVERSIGHT ISN'T HAPPENING WE ALREADY HAVE A VERY GOOD -- OVERSIGHT AND PLEASE INCLUDING -- AND A LOT OF PLACES THE CMT WHERE THE DISPATCHER GIVES MEDICAL -- ADVICE TO SOMEONE BEFORE THE AMBULANCE I EVEN GETS THERE -- WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN APPROPRIATELY THAT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE DOCTOR LEVEL THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN? I'M ALSO. JUST TO SAY WITHIN THE I'M I UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC DISPATCH -- BUT THE OTHER CONCERN IS THAT DOES THIS FRAGMENT TO EACH SPECIFIC -- FIRE AGENCY BECAUSE STUDIES SHOW OUTSIDE OF THE STATE AND EVEN WITHIN THIS -- IN IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT CENTRALIZING DISPATCH HELPS THAT PATIENT CARE IT HELPS -- THE SPEED OF CARE TO GET TO THOSE PATIENTS ESPECIALLY IN PATIENTS THAT WE KNOW NEED FAST RESPONSES CARDIAC ARREST. DROWNINGS SEIZURES THEY ALL NEED SOMEONE QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY NEED MEDICINES AN INTERVENTION -- ALSO BY PROVIDING DISPATCH INSTRUCTIONS -- TO PATIENTS THAT -- TO SEE THE CALLER FOR SOMEONE IN CARDIAC ARREST SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE NUMBER OF BYSTANDER CPR THAT'S PERFORMED IT GOES UP. EXPONENTIALLY THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH BY SENIOR CPR THAT HAPPENS UNLESS A DISPATCHER TELLS THEM TO DO IT -- BUT THAT WE ALSO KNOW IMPROVE SURVIVAL. I I JUST HAVE ONE MORE IT SORRY GO AHEAD CHRISTIE SORRY MISS FROM SORRY THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I MAY JUST TWO QUICK POINTS. THE COMMITTEE ESTAS TO TAKE AMENDMENTS OF THAT VOLUNTARY CONSENT IS TO REDUCE SERVICES PURSUANT TO THE MEDICAL CONTROL POLICIES OF THE COUNTY. SO IT'S NOT TOO DOES DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IT'S TO DO LESS THAN THE OTHER WAS. OTHERWISE WOULD DO IN THEIR COMMUNITY. VOLUNTARILY REDUCING THE SERVICE THANK YOU FOR THE RECORD RECOMMENDATION AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR INTENT WAS -- AND SECONDARILY. BUT BY THE BILL SAYING YOU COULD ONLY CONTRACT TO ANOTHER PUBLIC ENTITY IT IS NOT TAKING THE DECISION AWAY FROM THE COUNTY TO HOW TO COVER THE ENTIRE COUNTY. THEY'RE JUST IT JUST SAYS DON'T GIVE IT TO A PRIVATE PROVIDER. SO THAT ALL THE COUNTY CAN STILL PULL ALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO THE TABLE AND SAY HOW ARE WE GONNA DO DISPATCH IN THIS COUNTY. ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE EVERY SQUARE MILE IS COVERED AND EVERY EVERY RESPONSE IS IS ADEQUATE FOR EVERY ONE OF OUR CITIZENS AND THAT'S THAT'S THEIR JOB NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD. THANK YOU KEEP IN PLACE I I HAVE ONE QUESTION JUST BECAUSE I WANNA BE CLEAR ON INFRASTRUCTURE TYPE YEAH OKAY SO IS IT TO THE LIVE COLOR NOW GOES TO NINE ONE ONE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT GOES TO CENTRALIZE STATION AND THEN IT'S DISSEMINATED OUT. AND FIRE AMBULANCE WHOEVER RESPONSE FROM A COUNTY WIDE LEVEL CORRECT CORRECT WHEN IT GOES TO EITHER YOUR FIRE DEPARTMENT OR THE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT OR A FIRE DISTRICT OR IF IT IF IT'S BROKEN AT IS IS IT A IS IT A FLIP OF A SWITCH. IS IT A NINE ONE EIGHT IS THE CALL DIRECTED SENT LIKE HOW IS HOW IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE HOW IS IT IMPLEMENTED. I GUESS HOW DO YOU CHANGE IT. THIS IS A TNCS WHICH TO BRING THAT THE NINE ONE CALLS TO OUR DESERVE AT T. JUST HAS A FLIP A SWITCH AND HISTORICALLY SPEAKING WE DISPATCH THOSE COUNTY AGENCIES BEFORE. OKAY. I WOULD SAY FOR ENTITIES THAT HAVE OR ARE CURRENTLY DOING DISPATCH IT IS A VERY SIMPLE PROCESS FOR ENTITIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE EVER DONE IT OR MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE A COST. AND A TIME FOR THEM TO GET UP TO SPEED WE APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENTS THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER PLACES OF MADE IN THE ONES THAT DO HANDLE DISPATCH FOR US -- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT EVERY AT LIKE NEEDLES OR OTHER SMALL AREAS OR EVEN SMALLER FIRE DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE DISPATCH PER SE. IS THAT YES SIR. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT YOU PART OF OUR CONCERN IS NOT THAT YOU CAN BUILD A SYSTEM THAT HAS MULTIPLE. POINTS OF DISPATCH WITHIN IT BUT IT COMPLICATES THE SYSTEM IN A MEXICAN THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DROP A CALL AND HAVE A FAILED RESPONSE INCREASE WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. CHOSE TO HAVE A SINGLE CENTRALIZED DISPATCH CENTER SO POSSIBILITY. AIR STILL OCCUR NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUT THERE'S A WAY OF IDENTIFYING IT IN CORRECTING IT UNDER THE MEDICAL DIRECTION THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR. AND IF THE BILL. DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS AUTHORITY WHICH I THINK IT DOES BUT IT'S PLAIN READING. IF THEY JUST WANT TO PROHIBIT CONTRACTING OUT TO TO A PRIVATE ENTITY. THEN YOU CAN DROP ALL THE AMENDMENTS TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. BECAUSE CHANGING HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE IS ABOUT RESTRICTING MEDICAL CONTROL. SLICE PLAIN PLAIN LANGUAGE AND SO. A CITY CENTER HERTZBERG THAT'S RIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM AND I KNOW YOU GET THE BILL OUT WITHOUT MY THOUGH TO I'M NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THAT BUT I REALLY THINK THAT THERE IS. AN ISSUE THERE IF IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY IS IN CHARGE OF NINE ONE ONE THEN LET'S MAKE THE BILL ABOUT A PUBLIC AGENCY IN CHARGE OF NINE ONE ONE BUT NOT MESS WITH. THE LOCAL CONTROL OF MEDICAL CONTROL THAT HAS OVERSIGHT -- I KNOW MY COUNTY BURSARY SPECIFICALLY TO LARRY WAS HERE TO OPPOSE IT. AND THEY WANT MEDICAL CONTROL AND AND I HAD NOT HEARD THE PATCHWORK OF PORTION OF IT THAT KIND OF BOTHERS ME A LITTLE BIT I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE AT EASE NOW THAT I KNOW YOU JUST FLIP A SWITCH IT GOES TO YOU SO. BUT CAN YOU FLIP THE SAME SWITCHING GO TO NEEDLES CALIFORNIA OR YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW MODESTO MERCED IN OUR RULED VALLEY AREAS -- I THINK IT SHOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC PURVIEW I DO THAT'S ONE THING POLICE FIRE AND NINE ONE LINE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE IN THE PUBLIC. PURVIEW BUT NOT AN I DON'T THINK IT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF LOCAL CONTROL WITH ESPECIALLY THE MEDICAL. OVERSIGHT. SO THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS LET ME ACTUALLY IS STILL LEFT ME IN THE MIDDLE OKAY AND I KNOW WE HAVE SOME OF THE CUT BY JUST ONE MAKE. THIS CLEAR FINE I REALIZED -- MAYBE SOME DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BY THE OPPOSITION BUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN THAT OUR COMMITTEE WORKED ON WAS FOR THE VERY PURPOSE. OF TRYING TO ENSURE COUNTY MEDICAL DIRECTORS RETAIN. MEDICAL CONTROL. SO THAT THAT'S THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE BUT THE AUTHOR TOOK WERE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE CRAFTED I REALIZED OR MAYBE SOME -- DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BY THE OPPONENTS BUT THAT WAS THAT WAS THE VERY INTENTION OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- WE ASKED THE AUTHOR TO TAKE WHICH IS ACCEPTED SO. YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THOSE AMENDMENTS -- BUT I DID WANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT DECLARE FIVE WHAT WE HAD DONE. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT -- THE ONLINE -- SORRY. IT'S A CENTER TADA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO THANK -- A CENTER HERTZBERG FOR HIS EFFORTS IN WORKING ON THIS BILL -- AS YOU CAN SEE. THIS BILL IS -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED WHEN IT COMES TO RURAL CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY MY SENATE-DISTRICT RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUPPORT. I HAVE FRESNO COUNTY FIRE THAT'S IN SUPPORT BY ALSO IN OPPOSITION HAVE THE COUNTY FRESNO -- IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN MY EXPERIENCE AND I'M. IN IN IN IN CONCEPT I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON REALLY A TRUST SEEN ON A SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT REALLY PERTAIN. TO RURAL CALIFORNIA AND AND IN MY SENATE DISTRICT -- YOU KNOW MY EXPERIENCE BEING ON THE ON ON THE COUNT ON THE CITY COUNCIL. I'M A SMALL YOU KNOW. CITY IS THAT -- WE HAVE BUDGET PROBLEMS AND A WE WANT LOCAL CONTROL AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE AND CONTRACTING OUT BECAUSE WE DID THAT'S WHAT WE COULD AFFORD -- IS THAT SOMETIMES SO THAT WE CONTRACTED OUT WITH DIDN'T. WHEN WE CALLED AND YOU KNOW FOR NINE ONE ONE PAID INTO NO THE STREET OR THEY WEREN'T FAMILIAR WITH? WITH THE CITY -- OR THE STREETS FOR YOU KNOW CERTAIN LOCATIONS AND AND AND THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT BUT IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW TO HAVE THAT THAT LOCAL CONTROL BUT LIKE I SAID IT'S IT'S NOT -- IT'S IT'S COMPLICATED FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA AND AND I WANT TO CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE. THESE CHALLENGES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO TO MY SENATE DISTRICT BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS AND YOU KNOW I REPRESENT TWENTY THREE CITIES FOR COUNTIES FRESNO COUNTY BEING ONE OF THEM -- BUT A STE I REPRESENT TO LARRY KING'S AND CURRENT AS WELL. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY -- SO -- SEARCH FOR GRANDMA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFFS AND CERTAINLY I'M SURE YOU KNOW AND YOU'LL YOU'LL ADDRESS -- YOUR OPENNESS TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I MEAN I THINK WE TRIED -- WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO TRY TO CRAFT AMENDMENTS. TO REACH THE GOALS THAT WERE EXPRESSED THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MEDICAL CONTROL ON ME AS A PHYSICIAN AND I APPRECIATE. COLLEAGUES HERE -- THAT -- WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN I UNDERSTAND FROM THE PROPONENTS THE SHARE THE SAME GOAL AS WELL BUT SO THAT ASPECT OF IT AND THEN AND STILL WATCH EVEN THE AIMS OF YOUR BILL WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT I THINK -- I APPRECIATE US -- GROW SAYING THAT -- I THINK MANY OF US FEEL THAT. NINE ONE ONE IS SORT OF A CALL OR YOU KNOW PUBLIC SAFETY FUNCTION AND SHOULD RESIDE IN A PUBLIC ENTITY SO -- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE THAT THERE AND WE DO HAVE THOSE ACT MEDICAL TOOLS -- CAN NAIL OVERSIGHT BY THE IT THEMSELVES SO WAS SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN TRY BUT WE KNOW OUR COMMITTEE TRY WORKS TO TRY CRAFT AS AMENDMENTS I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ACCEPTING THOSE. AMENDMENTS TO TO TO TRY IT TO ACHIEVE THAT BUT IF THERE'S MORE -- YOU KNOW WE LOOK FOR TO THE CONVERSATION AND TO TO TO FURTHER CLARIFY THAT -- WITH THAT -- IS THERE A MOTION. OKAY -- CENTER DRAWS THOSE MOVED TO WHICH LIKE THE CLOTHES DOES YOUR FROM MOMENT TO WE HAVE AN EXPERT HERE WANTED TO ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS AND GET ANSWERS LIKE TO MAKE SURE HIS. THOUGHTS ARE SHARED IN THE RECORD OKAY AT YES PLEASE. ONE FAR TOO SERIOUS STOCKTON I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR QUESTION WAS ANSWERED BECAUSE OF SELECT WAS TO PART. THE ONE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING WHEN YOU'RE SPEAKING WITH CHIEF JOHNSON WAS AS IT RELATES TO SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. THERE ARE OTHER CITIES OF HIGH PERFORMING TO SPECIMENS WHERE THE NINE ONE ONE CALL COMES INTO A PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. IN GOES TO THAT CITY. AND IN THAT PARTICULAR PUBLIC AGENCY DISPATCH THAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE. THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR CITY IS AT NINE ONE ONE COMES IN IT GETS TRANSFERRED TO A SECOND PARTY IN HIM. BACK TO US IS SO THAT CALL IS TRANSFERRED ONCE IN A COMES BACK VIA COMPUTER -- TO US WHEN WE DISPATCH ENOUGH WITH CHIEF JOHNSON WAS TALKING ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. I GET ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES THAT YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT -- WE ARE DEFICIT PORT OF IMPROPER GOVERNMENTS AS IT RELATES. TO THE MEDICAL MAKING SURE THAT IS PROPER EMT BUT I ALSO WANT TO LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT THE BEST PRACTICES WHEN NINE ONE ONE COMES IN THAT ITGOES DIRECTLY. TO THE FIRE AGENCY THAT IS DISPATCHING AND THEN THEY DO THE PROPER EMT AND DISPATCH. AND WE MENTION ABOUT A STATE I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LOSVEGAS CART COUNTY WHERE WE PROCESS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALLS. IN ONE CENTER COMING THROUGH -- CALL COMES FROM THE PEACE UP DIRECTLY TO OUR CENTER AND WE PROCESS IT. IN THE WORKS OKAY AND SO THE ONLY THING THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE GOT GOING ON HERE SO I CAN COUNTIES THAT IT'S PEACE OUT. TO CONTRACTOR IN AND BACK TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PICTURE WAS CLEAN -- AND AND THAT IT WAS PAYING FOR IT AND AGAIN -- WHICH WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN AND WE WILL ENSURE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS WANT TO MEET WE'RE ALWAYS HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT OUR DISPENSERS. ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO LOCAL INTO SUCH WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU. HEY I APPRECIATE YOU POINTING THAT OUT BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET HEAR THAT RESPONSE AND I DO UNDERSTAND IT I DO I DO APPRECIATE IT AGAIN LIKE MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO. APPROVED REPRESENT LARGE RURAL AREAS THAT ME -- HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THIS BUT I REPRESENT CITIES WHO WANT IT SO -- I'M REALLY HOPING THAT -- YOU CAN WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AGAIN I BELIEVE THAT. SHOULD BE A PUBLIC ENTITY FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT RESPONSE TO NINE ONE ONE POLICE DEPARTMENT HOWEVER IT'S TIME IT SHOULD BE DEFINITELY PUBLIC AGENCY. AND SO I I HOPE YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH AN ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD BRING BOTH SIDES TOGETHER THANK YOU. UP TO ADDRESS A QUESTION. UP. THIS IS COME UP OF A FEW TIMES ABOUT A RURAL AREA -- I SEE HERE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM. SMALL CITIES WERE ROLL METROPOLITAN -- AN ALL IN SUPPORT OF THIS SO I I DON'T GET WHAT WHAT'S THE DANGER OF THIS -- OF THIS PROPOSAL TO RULE AREAS. WHY CENTER WHY IS THAT? I THINK IT'S A VERY SOON I DON'T. THE THING THAT ENDANGERS IF IT'S A CITY VERSUS A RURAL AREA BUT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT FROM THE REPRESENTATION HERE. I THINK IS IS I THINK THAT REALLY HELPS A SPRINGBOARD INTO THE THOUGHT SO ON SURE ON THE CLOSE OF THE COMMITTEE. YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU. I WOULD SUGGEST OVER A THOUSAND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IF I HAD ADAM ALL UP. A BOTH LABOR AND MANAGEMENT THIS IS NOT JUST THE THE THE FIREFIGHTERS DESERT PUSH CHEESE TOGETHER WHY BECAUSE THEY KNOW IN THEIR HEART. AND WHAT YOU SAID SENATOR GOAL OVER USUALLY GERMAN PAN IS EXACTLY THIS THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF PUBLIC SERVICE THIS IS THE FRONT LINE THIS IS WHO GETS THE CALL THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN THERE'S A MISTAKE BECAUSE IT'S CONTRACTED OUT. ORDER MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES RIGHT THERE ARE BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY THAT YOU DON'T SCRIMP ON THAT WE CAN'T MAKE A MISTAKE ON AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A COALITION. OF AN UNBELIEVABLE NUMBER OF PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WHO AT THEIR CORE AND WHAT THEY'RE ABOUT AND WHY THEY HAVE THESE JOBS WHEN I TALKED TO THE PRESIDENT THE FIRES FIRES SO STATION HE TALKS TO ME WITH GREAT EMOTION AND PASSION. BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC AND HE DOES HE ONLY SEES THESE KINDS OF MISTAKES. AND ALL OF HIS MEMBERS AND THE CHIEF SEE THESE MISTAKES THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE TRAVEL FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE SO YES THERE'S CHALLENGES THERE'S ALWAYS CHALLENGES IN MANAGEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONS AND WHEN YOU HAVE SPLIT BETWEEN COUNTIES WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE MONEY. VERSUS PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONDING TO THE CALLS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE TODAY YOU ARE SEEING THIS ISSUE I STAND WITH THEM I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.
