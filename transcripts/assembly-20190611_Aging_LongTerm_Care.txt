THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I HOPE I HAVEN'T USED UP MY TIME TO ISSUES RESOLVED. I THINK EVERYBODY HERE IS AWARE OF THE EXPLODING POPULATION OF YOURS IN CALIFORNIA HOW WE'RE REALLY NOT READY. FOR THAT STARTED TO SAY FOR THEM I SHOULD SAY FOR US -- I'M. AFTER A MINUTE I'M SO YOU'RE NOT THE THE ISSUE OF ABUSE AND OTHER CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING -- DISABILITY CAUSED BY AGING IS THE ONE THAT I'VE FOLLOWED FOR ACADEMICALLY AND IN POLICY FOR A LONG TIME BUT IT REALLY CAME HOME A FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN I WAS TALKING TO AN OLDER WOMAN WITH A DISABILITY WHO -- WAS TELLING ME HOW SHE HAD BEEN ABUSED -- SHE DIDN'T SAY WHAT THE ABUSE WAS AYE AYE I THINK IT WAS SEXUAL ABUSE BUT I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT BUT HE TO MUTE BEEN USING SOME SERIOUS WAY. SHE CALLED THE POLICE I THINK WAS THE SACRAMENTO POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND NEVER GOT A RESPONSE -- NO OFFICER NO CALL NO ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. NOTHING AND THE THE RESEARCH -- SUPPORT AND AND SHE WAS ON THE VERGE OF TEARS I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT -- THE THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT KIND OF RESPONSE OR NON RESPONSE IS IS ALL TOO COMMON. THERE WAS A TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SURVEY. OF ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. AND 48% OF THE RESPONDENTS WHO HAD REPORTED THAT THEY HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF CRIME SAID NOTHING HAPPENED WHEN THEY REPORTED TO POLICE THAT WAS NATIONWIDE MAYBE WE'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN CALIFORNIA NOW THANKS. TO THIS BILL NEXT YEAR LAST YEAR AND AND OTHER OTHER EFFORTS BUT IT'S BUT I'VE I'VE CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT EVEN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WHO ARE PART OF THEIR ELDER INDEPENDENT DON'T USE UNITS TO pCOLLEAGUES JUST DON'T? ARE TRAINED ENOUGH AREN'T THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA PROTOCOLS. AND THIS BILL WILL DO WILL TAKE A BIG STEP IN THAT DIRECTION TO FIX FIX THOSE PROBLEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SPENCER SACKS AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MAJORITY LEGAL CLINICS. THE NUMEROUS MCGEORGE LEGAL CLEMENT A CLINICS WORK CLOSELY WITH MANY GROUPS WHO ARE OFTEN IN DIRE NEED OF LEGAL SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY IN THE ELDER AND HELP OUR CLINIC AT MCGEORGE THE STAFF AND LAW STUDENTS WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE COMMUNITY ON ISSUES ENCOMPASSING ELDER LAW. LAW STUDENTS UNDERTAKE REPRESENTATION OF THE ELDERLY AND THE HOMELESS -- AND THE HOMELESS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA IN THE AREAS OF ELDER ABUSE RESTRAINING ORDERS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID ALL. ACCESS TO INCOME SERVICES CONSUMER MATTERS POWERS OF ATTORNEY -- TRUST ADMINISTRATION AND ESTATE PLANNING -- FOR OUR ELDERLY CLIENTS THE CLINIC OFTEN HANDLES -- THE CIVIL LOOK -- CIVIL LEGAL NEEDS OF THOSE -- EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SUCH AS A CRIMINAL RECORD EXPUNGEMENT HANDLE -- REDUCTIONS OF FINES AND FEES AND CHILD SUPPORT MODIFICATIONS. THIS BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE CLINICS ABILITY TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN OUR CLINIC BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICERS WOULD HAVE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM. TO CREATE MORE SUBSTANTIAL REPORTS THAT WE FREQUENTLY OUT RELY ON IN OUR WORK -- ACCORDING TO THE GREG SAID HAS THE LARGEST GROWING -- OF THE LARGEST GROWING POPULATION IS SENIORS AND THIS IS OUR FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IN THE NATION. THE STATE HAS FALLEN BEHIND IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES TO PROVE -- PROPERLY PREPARE FOR THIS LARGE SCALE DEMOGRAPHIC TRANSITION -- LAW ENFORCEMENT MUST BE PREPARED TO SHED LIGHT ON THESE TYPES OF CRIMES PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- INCLUDING DISABILITIES CAUSED BY ADVANCED AGE ARE VICTIMIZED BY VIOLENT CRIMES THREE POINT FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE WITHOUT -- FOR THOSE WITH COGNITIVE DISABILITIES SUCH AS DEMENTIA INTELLECTUAL DISPARITIES AND MENTAL ILLNESS THE RATE IS MORE LIKE FIVE POINT FIVE TIMES. THIS VICTIMIZATION IS OFTEN COMMITTED BY PERPETRATORS THAT THE VICTIM KNOWS -- INCLUDING CARETAKERS. TO FURTHER COMPOUND THIS ISSUE THESE CRIMES ARE UNDER REPORTED AND THEY ARE UNDER INVESTIGATED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF THE CRIMES. OFTEN DISMISSING THEM AS CIVIL MATTERS -- THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE BY SPARSE AND CONSISTENT TRAINING EDUCATION AND WRITTEN POLICIES REGARDING THESE TYPES OF ABUSES. THROUGH THIS BILL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES WILL BETTER PROTECT SAID AS A SENIOR CITIZENS AND BETTER PROTECT ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. THROUGH EFFECTIVE FORMAL POLICIES BETTER TRAINING AND OVERALL AWARENESS OF THE STATUTORY POWERS RESPONSIBILITIES PARTICULAR TO THESE CRIMES. SB THREE THREE EIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES THE EDUCATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WILL UPDATE A LOT OF REQUIRE THEIR POLICIES AND TRAINING TO BETTER ADDRESS THE SAFETY OF SENIORS AND DISABLED CITIZENS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION.

A TRANSACTION FROM HAPPENING -- AND I ESPECIALLY CONCERNED IF. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ONE DAY TO ANOTHER MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IF YOU'RE SELLING STOCKS -- ANOTHER IS IF THERE IS IF -- IF THEY DIE IN THE MEANTIME WHILE SOMEBODY IS INVESTIGATING THIS WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

FIVE TWELVE WHICH TAKES FIRST CRITICAL STEP IN CREATING A NEW LONG TERM SERVICES -- SUPPORT AND SUPPORTS OUR L. TSS BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA. THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION IS THE BENEFIT IS URGENT ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER OLDER ADULTS ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE WITH PHYSICAL MENTAL DISABILITIES CURRENTLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. IN THIS POPULATION WILL CONTINUE TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. UNFORTUNATELY MANY CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE L. D. S. A SERVICES. LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MOST CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE. PAYING OUT OF POCKET FOR L. TSS IS HIGHLY EXPENSIVE AND CREATES A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL BIRD FOR FAMILIES. ALTERNATIVELY CALIFORNIANS THEN MUST SPEND DOWN THROUGH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW. TOO OFTEN THIS MEANS THEY PRIMARY. INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE ACCESS TO PAY LONG TERM SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. AND CERTAINLY WELL MEDI CAL IS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET SYSTEM THE SAFETY THAT SYSTEM IS OVERBURDENED. AND THAT ALSO OF COURSE MEANS THAT MORE TAX DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE TO ALLOCATE. INDIVIDUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE TO IMPOVERISH THEMSELVES. SPEND THROUGH THE LIFE SAVINGS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE OR TO FOREGO WORKING AND GENERATING. EARNED INCOME IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO LIVE INDEPENDENT HIGH QUALITY LIVES. THIS LEGISLATION CREATES A FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS BENEFITS TO BE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE TWELVE CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE MODELED AFTER TO CAL SEAVER SECURE CHOICE PROGRAM FOR ONE CALIFORNIA'S RATE TO DESIGN AND FINANCE THE NEW BENEFIT. INDEED THIS LEGISLATION IS SPONSOREDBY CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF L. D. S. TO STAKEHOLDERS. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD NOW TO PUT THESE CRITICAL PIECES IN PLACE SO WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH BENEFIT AND FINANCING DESIGN.

MY NAME IS DAVID FEINBERG I AM A VOLUNTEER WITH A A RP AND I'M HERE TODAY TO REPRESENT A A RP IN ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. A A RP IS A MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA AGING ALLIANCE AND WITH A VERY ACTIVE IN THE DEVELOPMENT THIS BILL ALONG WITH THE WITH THE SENATOR. THE COST OF LONG TERM CARE IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE AT SOME POINT WE WILL ALL AGE INTO THAT KIND OF SITUATION. ALL. NORMAL FAMILIES THAT ARE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE ELDERLY OR SICK INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THAT KIND OF CARE OFTEN HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR JOB BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T. JUST THE MERE COSTA MAINTAINING AND A FIFTEEN CAN BE MORE THAN A FAMILY BUDGET CAN TAKE. AVERAGE PERSON WHO IS SUPPORTING A FAMILY AS A FAMILY CARETAKER SPENDING ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH OUT OF THEIR OWN. POCKET IF YOU HAVE THE CARD WITH ALZHEIMER'S OR THE KINDER TO MATCH IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHERE DOES THE AVERAGE FAMILY GET THAT KIND OF SUPPORT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE PERSON. IN WORST CASE SCENARIOS INDIVIDUAL HAS TO GO ON AN INSTITUTION IN WHICH CASE INSTITUTIONAL COSTS BECOME MUCH GREATER THAN MOST FAMILIES CAN SUPPORT AND IF YOU DO YOU WIND UP TAKING. FROM THE NEXT GENERATION WHO WON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES MY SITUATION IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT I HAVE A NINETY FOUR YEAR OLD MOTHER. WHO LIVES IN THE MIDDLE? A MEMORY KERR UNIT ON A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FACILITY FACILITY COSTS A LITTLE OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH SHE GETS TWO THOUSAND AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS PENSION. AND THREE THOUSAND FROM HOSPICE CARE THAT. FIVE THOUSAND WHERE DOES THE OTHER FOUR THOUSAND COME FROM SHE HAS NO SAVINGS TO PAY FOR THAT SO AS AN ONLY CHILD I PAY FOR IT. YES I'M TAKING THAT MONEY OUT OF MY OWN RETIREMENT POCKET SO WHEN MY WIFE AND I IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS REACHED THE POINT WHERE WE NEED THAT KIND OF CARE. WHERE'S THE RESOURCE GOING TO BE TO DO THAT FOR THOSE KINDS OF REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT.

COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS YES MISTER KALRA. AS CHAIR OF THANK YOU SENATOR -- YOU FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. FORWARD I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH THAT SPOKE IN AND AND MANY THAT AREN'T IN THE ROOM. HAVE BEEN -- WILL FOCUS ON THIS OF WORKING ON THIS LONG BEFORE I EVER JOINED LEGISLATURE IS SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO SEE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT JOINING WITH THE SENATOR. IN AND PUSHING THIS FORWARD I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY -- WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE ASSEMBLY WE HAD INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON ON LONG TERM CARE SERVICES LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AND THE -- ESSENTIAL NONEXISTENCE OF OF IT AND AND AND THE VIABILITY OF IT THAT I MEAN WE KNOW. THAT -- THEY WERE IN A CRISIS AND IT'S A CRISIS WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED THE CARE TO CRISIS FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT CARE FOR THEM. AND IT'S CRISIS BY HSS WORKERS AND OTHERS THAT ARE THE CARETAKERS THAT CAN BARELY CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CARE TAKERS -- AS WELL. AS THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE CARE -- OUR BRUCE LITERALLY SAVING THE STATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR BY PUTTING UP THEIR OWN MONEY OR BY SACRIFICING. OR BY GOING WITHOUT. A AND SO. THE SYSTEMS UNSUSTAINABLE BECAUSE WE CAN'T EXPECT. THOSE THAT RECEIVE THE CARE AND PROVIDE THE CARE TO CONTINUE TO GO ON THIS WAY. AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. SO THAT WE CAN TRULY CREATE A PATH FORWARD THAT COULD THAT SUSTAINABLE THAT RESPECTS THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING THE CARE AS WELL AS THOSE PROVIDING THE CARE. AND THAT ULTIMATELY -- MIGHT REALLY SAVES THE STATE -- BECAUSE THE STATE THAT A IS NOT ONLY -- SUSTAINING IN ABLE TO SUSTAIN -- THE CURRENT A MODEL OF ON THE BACKS OF SO MANY BUT ALSO IN THE STATE'S GOING TO COLLAPSE UNDER UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE OF THE BURDENS OF THE NEEDS. PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH THE GROWING CERTAINLY THE GROWING ELDERLY POPULATION AND THOSE THAT HAVE THE NEEDS. BUT EVEN IF WE WERE JUST TO STAY STATUS QUO IN TERMS OF NUMBERS IT'S JUST UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEM. AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TRULY MOVE FORWARD -- BUT I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE THAT DOES PROVIDES PROVIDE SOME HOPE AND SOME -- SOME EXCITEMENT -- WITH THAT WITH OUR ADMINISTRATION AND I I KNOW THAT -- IS LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES -- IN IN IN A FRESH WAY WITH OUR OUR CHAIR WHO I KNOW CARES DEEPLY ABOUT THESE ISSUES I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY MOVE THE BALL FORWARD ABOVE UNDER THE SENATORS LEADERSHIP SO -- WITH THAT I WAS A RESPECTFULLY MOVE THE BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU -- THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL [inaudible] SOME.
