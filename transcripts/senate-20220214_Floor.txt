THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE WITH GREAT PRIDE- TO CONGRATULATE THE LOS ANGELES RAMS OF FOR THEIR VICTORY AS A SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I RISE AS THE SENATOR OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE I THINK THAT ALL OF US WOULD BE PROUD. TO SHARE IN THATIN THAT VICTORY I ALSO RISE TO SAY THAT THIS IS A VICTORY NOT ONLY FOR THE FOOTBALL TEAMS THEMSELVES FOR THE RAMS THEMSELVES. BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE BROUGHT TO THE COMMUNITY- EXTRAORDINARY SMALL BUSINESS OUTREACH AND- SHARING OF THE PROSPERITY. AND ALSO OF WHICH GOT SOME ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA IS THE BEST AND STRONGEST CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COMMUNITY AND TO OUR STATE. AND THAT IS THE CREATION OF GOOD JOBS JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE GAME- AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED WITH THE CONCESSION WORKERS WHERE. DIRT DISHWASHERS WILL GO AS HIGH AS THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR DURING THE TERM OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH PENSION AND HEALTH BENEFITS SO THIS WAS A VICTORY FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THAT RECOGNIZE RECOGNITION SAYING THIS IS REALLY. AMERICA WHILE I WAS GOING TO SAY NO MY CORRUPT SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANT TO ECHO OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM EAST LOS ANGELES STATED. AND AS INDIVIDUAL WHO REPRESENTS INGLEWOOD I'VE SEEN A TREMENDOUS UPTICK AND COMMUNITY PRIDE BUT ALSO ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITY THIS IS PAST WEEKEND WE WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. A WITH A LOT OF LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE RECEIVED GRANTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE SUPER BOWL AND SO IT HAS HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT BUT AS STATED ALSO IT'S BROUGHT GREATER AWARENESS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF. ORGANIZED LABOR AND THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY NOT ONLY IN BUILDING THAT STADIUM BUT HELPING TO MAINTAIN AND GROW ITSELF I TOO WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE INGLEWOOD ROUNDS FOR A GREAT YEAR AND A GREAT. VICTORY SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST ALSO WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THE COMMISSARY STATED HERE BUT IN PARTICULAR I DID SEE A LOT OF FOCUS ON TRYING TO ELEVATE WOMEN WOMEN OF COLOR ARE MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR WOMEN ON AND SO I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT AND FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY BROUGHT TO LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR I DON'T THINK OF THAT THE GAME ITSELF BUT ALL THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE AROUND THE STADIUM ALSO BENEFITED IN A BIG WAY SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY AND DIAGRAMS. THANK YOU. SENATOR KAMLAGER. THANK YOU I TO WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE WORLD CHAMPIONS THE LOS ANGELES RAMS FOR THEIR VICTORY AND ON WEDNESDAY WHILE WE WILL BE HERE THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE- THE HAVING THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PARADE THROUGHOUT THE CITY STARTING IN THE THIRTY S. SENATE DISTRICT YOU KNOW I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING PART OF AN EVENT ON SATURDAY BEFORE THE GAME DAY WITH LOCAL ELEVEN UNITE HERE CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION OF AN AGREEMENT WITH SO FIVE STADIUM SO THAT THAT STADIUM IS A 100% UNION. AND WHEN WE ARE FIGHTING ON THIS FLOOR FOR INVESTMENTS INTO COMMUNITIES AND FOR GOOD PAYING UNION CAREERS IT IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE THOSE KINDS OF DAYS HAPPEN WHERE YOU HAVE FOLKS ACROSS A GENDER AND ETHNIC SPECTRUM. EXCITED ABOUT PARTNERING WITH AN EMPLOYER. THAT SEES THEM AND DIGNIFIED AS THEIR WORK. I ALSO WANT TO SAY. HOW EVENTS LIKE THIS. HAVE AN EXPONENTIAL IMPACT ON LOCAL ECONOMIES AND ONE OF THE THINGS IT ALSO HAS AN IMPACT ON HIS ON TRANSPORTATION SO AS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT. ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING THIS YEAR I HOPE THAT WE WILL PAY ATTENTION TO THE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE BUT SPECIFICALLY THOSE THAT CENTER AROUND THESE HUBS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY LIKE THE SURPRISE STADIUM SO THAT WE CAN PUSH FORWARD TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF GAME DAYS LIKE WE SAW SUNDAY. EXCITING. FOR THAT'S ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO IF- IF I COULD ASK YOU ALL TO GIVE A SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR THE LA RAMS CONGRATULATIONS ON A VICTORY JOB WELL DONE.
