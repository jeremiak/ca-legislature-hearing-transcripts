GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRESENT AB. TWO ZERO ZERO SIX BOB FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. I PRESENT TO YOU THIS BILL WHICH WILL PROVIDE RELIABLE AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TO THE MANY AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN OUR STATE. MUCH OF CALIFORNIA SUCCESS AS THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO ITS BOOMING AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. NONE OF THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT CALIFORNIA'S HARD WORKING AGRICULTURAL LABOURS. THESE LABORS WORK LONG HOURS IN EXTREME TEMPERATURES AND CONDITIONS TO KEEP THIS INDUSTRY GOING. THE SAME AGRICULTURAL WORKERS CAN OFTEN LIVE IN EXTREME POVERTY WHERE THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS. MANY OF THE FARMWORKERS MISS TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES TO REMOTE WORK SITES BUT STRUGGLE TO SECURE SAFE RELIABLE AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS CREATED A VAN PULL PILOT PROGRAM FOR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS LIVING IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT ALTHOUGH GRANTS FOR THE EXISTING PILOT PROJECTS HAVE YET TO BE AWARDED OTHER VAMP POLLS HAVE ALREADY BEEN IN OPERATION AND HAVE PROVEN TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE AGRICULTURAL BAND POLL GRANT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE WORKERS WITH THE CLEANER MORE RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTION. IT WILL SUPPORT OUR AGRICULTURAL WORKERS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY HELPING TO REDUCE EMISSIONS BY CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. IF IT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. FIELD WORK REQUIRES THAT YOU HAVE A VEHICLE THAT IS. RELIABLE IN WORKING CONDITION AND THEN YOU HAVE TO FIND THE FIELD THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING IN AND DRIVE OUT THERE IT'S FAIRLY EXPENSIVE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR OWN VEHICLE AND THIS WILL PROVIDE A GREAT ALTERNATIVE. BECAUSE A BAND PULLS WILL WELL AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES GOING UP TO THE FIELDS AND A PROVIDE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION THAT BETTER MUCH NEEDED. WITH ME HERE TODAY OUR CAR MARK CORY BOLAS WITH BOUT CAL BAND AS WELL AS A COW BANDS WRITER. THANK YOU. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ERA PRESENTED PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS KORABL US ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA VAMP AUTHORITY WE ARE A GPA PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCY THAT PROVIDES BOTH GENERAL AND AGRICULTURAL VAN PULLS. R. AGDAM PULLS OPERATE IN MOST OF THE STATE'S AGRICULTURAL AREAS CENTRAL VALLEY CENTRAL COAST RIVERSIDE COACHELLA. AS I AM MS CABALLERO A REFERENCE MANY OF OUR WRITERS COME FROM VERY IMPOVERISHED BACKGROUNDS THEY LACK FINANCIAL RESOURCES NECESSARY. FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS IN RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS TO GET TO WORK EVERY DAY. IN MANY CASES THE VAN POOLS THAT WE OFFER ARE THEIR ONLY MEANS TO GET TO WORK AND DEMAND FOR THESE SAMPLES IS FAR OUTPACING SUPPLY. SO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD PROJECT ON THIS WERE VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT ONCE AGAIN AS REFERENCED. IT CURRENTLY UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE DOESN'T ALLOW LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. SO AB TWO THOUSAND SIX WILL MAKE IT STATEWIDE WILL MAKE ALL FARMWORKERS FROM LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY TOO CAN ACCESS. A OF A CLEAN RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTION AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND HE REPRESENTED PLEASE.

SO THEN I HIT THE GOVERNMENT SIMPLE WE SAID WE'RE GONNA ALMOST OFFICIAL I SAW THE VAN IN THE ROAD AND I WROTE DOWN THE PHONE NUMBER AND I CALLED AND. EVERYONE IN EVERYONE FITS VERY COMFORTABLY.

WE WORK WITH A LOT OF COMMUNITIES WHO USE VAN PULLS TO REACH SERVICES AT THE OTHER WISE COULDN'T REACH. SUCH AS HEALTH CENTERS THE EMBASSY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND ARE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD BE EXPANDED TO ADDRESS AGRICULTURAL TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. A BIT BROADER THAN ON AGRICULTURAL WORK INTO THAT END ON THERE ARE SEVERAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES THAT WORK IN OTHER FIELDS. ON THE SIDE COME FIELDWORK AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT AND I'M IN ALSO SOMETIMES THE TOURISM INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AND WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE THIS PROGRAM COULD.

THE BILL IS TEN OF WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO. FILE ITEM SAYS YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THEIR. THE THING IS FILE ITEM OF. THREE. OF AB EIGHTEEN SEVEN THREE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER OVER OBERNOLTE PLEASE COME TO THE GUYS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN YOU AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT CREATED A VETERANS DESIGNATION ON CALIFORNIA STATE ID AND DRIVER'S LICENSES IN THIS IS PROVING TO BE. A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN NOT ONLY GIVING OUR VETERANS THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY HAVE VERNE BUT ALSO IN CONNECTING THEM FOR TO STATE AND FEDERAL BENEFITS THAT IN MANY CASES THEY'RE NOT EVEN. AWARE THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR. IN FACT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THIS YEAR OVER TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF BENEFITS WILL BE AWARDED TO THOSE BUT. THOSE VETERANS JUST THIS YEAR AND SEVENTEEN MILLION AND RETROACTIVE PAYMENTS IN FACT I ALMOST A THIRD. OF THE VETERANS WHO REQUEST THIS DESIGNATION ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS THAT THEY DID NOT REALIZE THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR. HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY NOT A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIA VETERANS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS DESIGNATION HAS APPLIED AND SO WE'RE SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION RATE. LAST YEAR A. B. THREE SIXTY THREE. WAIVE THE FEE FOR LOW INCOME AND HOW AND HOMELESS VETERANS FOR APPLYING FOR THE VETERANS DESIGNATION AND THIS BILL AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WOULD EXTEND THAT TO SENIOR CITIZENS. I SUBMIT THAT. OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIA VETERANS ARE SENIOR CITIZENS AND IF YOUR SENIOR SINCE IN MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON A FIXED INCOME IT'S NOT AN EASY THING ON A FIXED INCOME TO AFFORD EXPENSE LIKE THIS. AND. WAVING THAT. THE FEES TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO APPLY WOULD BE A FITTING. AND A VERY A COMPELLING WAY OF EXPRESSING OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE SACRIFICES THAT THESE VETERANS HAVE MADE TO OUR SOCIETY SO WITH THAT I'D RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. SECOND WITH FIRST AND SECOND TO HIGH. MR FORUM THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER BAKER. SO. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TEST MY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NINE ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC BUT WOULD LIKE TO. DESPITE OPPOSITION TO THE AUTHORS BILL. SEEING NINE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE OF THE AUTHOR. SO I DO. BROWN IS THE DMV HERE. COME THE. PLEASE. SO WHILE YOU'RE WALKING A POSTCARD. SO THIS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS COULD THIS BILL WHICH EXEMPTS HALF THE VETERAN POPULATION. FROM PAYING THE FIVE DOLLARS TO BE. RESULT IN A HIGHER FEE FOR THE REST OF THE VETERAN POP POPULATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM NOT. JIM WOOD WORD ACTING DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR LEGISLATION INDIAN THE. AND OUT WHILE DMV DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS LEGISLATION. I DO ENVY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE IN IN ANTICIPATE INCREASING FIVE DOLLAR FEE IS THE RESULT OF THE SLIDES. SO IF NOT IT IS POSSIBLE TO THE ENTIRE FEE FOR ALL VETERANS. I'M SORRY. IS IT POSSIBLE TO WAIVE THE FEE FOR ALL VETERANS INSERTED THE SIXTY TWO. A YEAR TO AGE LIMIT. ARE AT THIS POINT. WE'RE JUST. DOING AN ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOP IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO DMB. YOU CAN NEVER. AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS A WHEN WE DID. NINE THIRTY FIVE. WE ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED THE INITIAL COST FROM THE DMP FROM TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER INDIVIDUAL DOWN TO FIVE DOLLARS. OR WAS GOING TO VETO. SO. NOW WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. SEVERAL YEARS LATER HAS THE AUTHORS STATED. THAT. THERE HAS BEEN SOME LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE BUT WE'VE HAD SOME. SOME SOME. CHALLENGES IS GETTING THE INFORMATION NOW. AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME PUSH BACK FROM SOME OF THE VETERANS ABOUT THE FIVE DOLLAR FEE. BUT THE BENEFITS THIS BRINGS FORWARD THAT SOME OF THESE VETERANS DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEY HAD COMING BECAUSE OF THE PROCESS WHERE SERIOUS SO. BRICK HAS BROUGHT IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ABSOLUTELY MILLIONS AND THEY HAVE THAT DOCUMENTED. AND SO. I'M WONDERING AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS FOR THE MOST PART THE BILL TODAY. THAT IF YOU WERE WILLING TO WAIVE FOR THAT SIXTY TWO AND OLDER THAT WE LOOK AT THE ABILITY BASED ON THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS. BACK TO THE. THE WE WAVE EVERY DOLLAR EVERY BIT OF THE FEE FOR ALL VETERANS GOING FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY. AS THE AUTHORS STATED. THEIR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THE. THE ANSWER TO THAT TO INFORM ME I COULD DO SOME RESEARCH AND PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. GOING AS MOVES FORWARD AND APPRECIATED AS AUTHOR GOES THROUGH. THE PROCESS THAT THAT WE DO BECAUSE WE ARE ON TIME. OF CONSTRAINTS ABOUT AS A GROUP MOST THROUGH. BUT I WOULD. STRONGLY URGE. THIS POSSIBILITY BECOME A REALITY. A BASED ON YOU KNOW USING KNOWLEDGE WITH THAT YOU COULD WAVE. HALF THE POPULATION SO. WITH THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR. YOUR TESTIMONY. SO BASED ON THE ADVICE ONE OF THE COMMITTEE ANY TIME TO. THIS MATHIS. I HAVE GOT TO SPEAK OUT IS ONE OF THE VETERANS UP HERE. ON LOVE THE BILL. CARRIED FROM DVD THAT THE NUMBERS ARE DOABLE AND THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR. ACTUALLY COMING OUT AND SAYING LET'S DO THIS FOR ALL VETERANS. ALL OF. THEY ARE VETERANS ARE TO PAY THE PRICE PERIOD. SO AS LEGISLATURE'S AND AS A STATE WE NEED ANY UP AND TAKE CARE OF THEM. NO ONE IS SAYING THAT BECAUSE I'M WHAT I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE HE'S GOT PAVE THE WAY FOR MY GENERATION. AND WE OWE IT TO THEM SO LET'S THE RIGHT THING HERE. THANK YOU. WITH THAT. I MEAN HE THAT WOULD LIKE TO. FINISH UP. YOU I CLOSE UP MANY MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE COSTS INVOLVED ARE ACTUALLY QUITE MODEST. FOR THIS BILL UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND BY EXTENSION I WOULD IMAGINE IF WE. INCLUDED ALL VETERANS WOULD BE UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BENEFITS THAT THIS PROGRAMS ARE YOU BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA SO. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID. WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU ADD ME ON AS A CO AUTHOR IT IF THE DMV IS ABLE TO. OF LIMIT ALL COSTS FOR VETERANS BOB HAVE A TASTE ON THEIR CAVIAR OKAY. OF WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION FROM. SO LYMPHOMA AND. BY. HARPER SEKHMET HARPER. MEN SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE COLD WORLD.

COLLEAGUES I AM PROUD TO PRESENT TO AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE THE CLEAN TRUCK DEPLOYMENT ACT WHICH AIMS TO CREATE A MORE EQUAL PLAYING FIELD FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE TRUCK. TRUCKING FIELD BY ALLOWING ZERO MISSION IN NEAR ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS TO HAVE THE SAME CARRY CARRYING CAPACITY. AS DIESEL TRUCKS. EXISTING LAW PLACES WEIGHT LIMITS ON OUR TRUCKS PROTECT OUR ROADS. ELECTED TRUCKS NATURAL GAS TRUCKS AND OTHER CLEAN. VEHICLE FEW FUELING HIM ON PROPULSION SYSTEMS. TEN TO WAY MORE THAN THEIR DIESEL COUNTERPARTS. AND COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH OUR WEEK RESTRICTIONS CLEAN TRUCKS HAVE TO REDUCE THEIR CARRYING CAPACITY. MAKING THEM NONCOMPETITIVE WITH DIESEL TRUCKS. IN THE SHORT TERM THIS SERVES AS A DISTINCT. A DISTINCTIVE. DISTINCT A DISADVANTAGE FOR TRUCK OWNERS TO BUY CLEAN TRUCKS. IN THE LONG TERM. AS WE MOVE AWAY FROM DIESEL. THE DECREASE CURRENT TO PASS REQUIRE MORE TRIPS AND THIS WILL RESULT IN EVEN GREATER CONGESTION. AND MORE WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR HIGHWAYS. RIGHT NOW FEDERAL LAW ONLY GRANTS THIS TYPE OF WEIGHT EXEMPTION FOR NATURAL GAS VEHICLES ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS. I'M SO I'M WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH THE BILL. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY CHRISTIAN MOTOR WITH THE CALVARY TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. AND JOHN. BOTH CELL. SEE YOU OF CAL STATE TO ANSWER ANY OF THE QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WITNESSES IN IN FAVOR ELECTIVE. IS THAT. I DON'T. I THINK YOU CHAIRED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTIAN OUT UP WITH CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. WE WANT EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE FROM THE. FOR THE MANY REASONS I STATED BY THE CHAIR. WHILE TWENTY FOUR STATES. INCLUDING OUR NEIGHBORS ORGAN NEVADA ALREADY PERMIT TRUCKS OF ANY FUEL TYPE. TOP RATE WELL ABOVE EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AMONG THE STATES IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE WILL HELP FLEETS OVERCOME ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO DEPLOYMENT OF ADVANCED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. I AS AN EXAMPLE A THIRD GENERATION BAY AREA TRUCKING COMPANY. WHO PLANS TO DEPLOY TEN ELECTRIC SHOCKS SAID EIGHTY PERCENT THEIR LOADS WAY EIGHTY THOUSAND POUNDS? WITHOUT ALLOWANCES FOR BATTERY WAIT THEY FEAR THAT THEIR CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR LETTER TRUCKS WILL ROAD DUE TO AND UP TO THIRTY PERCENT LOSS IN THEIR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. IN AG COLLAR AND SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY TOLD US TWENTY TO AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE WILL BE THE DETERMINING FACTOR IN WHETHER. HE SWITCHES FROM DIESEL NATURAL GAS. I THIS BILL WILL ALLOW TRUCKERS TO BE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS WILL STILL NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK REALIZE. MY NAME'S JOHN BRAZIL PRESIDENCY OF CALCITE WERE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MEMBER COMPANIES ALL DEDICATED TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES. YEAH HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES MAKE UP TWENTY THREE PERCENT. MAKE UP ONLY THREE PERCENT OF OUR VEHICLE POPULATION YET THEY GENERATE TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS TRANSPORTATION RELATED MISSIONS. AND MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF THE CRITERIA MISSIONS THAT CREATE AIR POLLUTION. TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TODAY THAT REPLACE DIESEL POWERED TRUCKS AND MORE WILL BE COMING CHRIS COOLEY BILL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. OUR MEMBERS DO HAVE THESE TRUCKS IN THE TECHNOLOGY BUT THE ARE HEAVIER BECAUSE THE BATTERY PACKS IN THE CLEAN FUEL. A STORAGE TANKS. WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REMOVE THIS THIS WEIGHT BARRIER. SO THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN MOVE FORWARD AND AS CHRIS POINTED OUT TWENTY FOUR OTHER STATES IN THE DORY ADOPTED SIMILAR PROVISIONS ALABAMA TEXAS IN MISSOURI ARE AHEAD OF US ON THIS BUSINESS US POLICY. SO WE ARE ENCOURAGED SURE AND I VOTE FOR THE CHAIRMAN'S AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE. BUT THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JUST SHY YOUNG I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLES COALITION. WE ARE ALSO CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ASSOCIATION OF NATURAL GAS VEHICLE ENGINE MANUFACTURERS UTILITIES FUEL PROVIDERS AND OPERATORS WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR THIS BILL. AND. JUST FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED THERE ARE TRUCKS ALREADY ON THE ROAD THAT ARE IN NEED OF THIS EXEMPTION. YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH POND IN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL A HUNDRED COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR THIS MEASURE A AND URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ARE WHERE THE FIRST TO GO OUT AND PURCHASE THESE VEHICLES I SENSE THEN SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE PRODUCING RENEWABLE FUEL OUT OF THE ORGANICS. I AND THAT'S ANOTHER BIG STEP. OF A NET NEGATIVE FUEL UP BELOW THE ZERO LINE TO HELP THE ENVIRONMENT SO WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. KAREN I'M MICHAEL SHAW CALIFORNIA MANY FACTORS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATIONS SPORT AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE WE THINK THIS CREATES. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE THE SYRIAN WHILE OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED IT. CALIFORNIA IS THE SOURCE WHERE MANY OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE BORN.
