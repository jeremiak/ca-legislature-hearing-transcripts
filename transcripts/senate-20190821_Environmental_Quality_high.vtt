PRIMARY VEHICLES THAT HAVE

00:11:57.817 --> 00:11:58.684
ALMOST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.318

BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU.

00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:03.189
SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION THAT I

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:05.991
HAVE. WITH CALIFORNIA'S LEADING

00:12:06.058 --> 00:12:08.060
IN. CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW IT

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.996
AFFECTS. SOMEBODY WAS IN

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:13.766
BUSINESS SO WE HAVE A TRUCKING

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:15.568
BUSINESS MY WIFE AND I AND WHEN

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.236
KEY CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES

00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:21.607
BOARD DECIDED TO MANDATE THAT

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.074
YOUR VEHICLE HAD TO BE

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:23.409
RETROFITTED NO MATTER. WHEN YOU

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:27.413
BOUGHT IT IT WAS. TO THE TO THE

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.749
LAWS THAT CALIFORNIA HAD SET.

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.918
AT THE TIME IT WAS MANUFACTURED

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:33.819
SO LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE IF

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:37.189
YOU HAVE A OF THE HEAVY VEHICLE

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.860
THAT'S DEBTS A TWO THOUSAND AND

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:41.427
TWO THOUSAND THIS IS PICK A

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:42.995
DATE TWO THOUSAND IT WAS

00:12:43.062 --> 00:12:44.463
MANUFACTURED IN TWO THOUSAND TO

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.197
MEET THE STANDARDS OF

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:48.033
CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE THEN

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.469
THE EPA THE FEDERAL EPA.

00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:51.337
CALIFORNIA CAME IN AND SAID

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:52.671
WELL THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR

00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:53.839
US WE NEED TO. MAKE YOU

00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:56.175
RETROFIT YOUR VEHICLE AND SO IT

00:12:56.242 --> 00:12:58.477
WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

00:12:58.544 --> 00:12:58.978
DOLLAR RETROFITTED ONLY

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:02.414
CALIFORNIA DID. SO IN OUR CASE

00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:04.517
WE AYE WE EACH HAVE TO RETROFIT

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.785
OR BY AND THEY GAVE US YOU GAVE

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:07.386
ME THEY GAVE ME SOME TIME. YOU

00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:09.655
HAD HEALTH. IN CERTAIN CASES

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.189
TWENTY REDUCE OF THE IN MY

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:13.459
POINT IS THAT. WE KNEW THAT TO

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:15.528
THE PASSENGER CAR WE ONLY DID

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:16.128
IT TO THE PERSON WHO IS IN

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:17.897
BUSINESS IS TRACKING AND SO.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:21.567
THE PASSENGER CAR IS ABLE TO AS

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:23.002
IT WEARS OUT THE MANUFACTURES

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.504
WERE MANDATED TO BRING US TO A

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.206
TEAR FOR MOTOR WHICH IS WHAT

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:29.208
THEY WE HAVE NOW AND SO YOU GOT

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.876
THE LIFE OF YOUR PIECE OF

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:33.212
EQUIPMENT. YOU GOT TO USE IT

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.713
AND YOU DIDN'T GET PUNISHED

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.648
CHANGING THE RULES IN THE

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:38.384
MIDDLE THE GAME AND SO MY POINT

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:39.485
IS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK

00:13:39.552 --> 00:13:42.087
ABOUT HOW WE'RE CHANGES CLIMATE

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.123
AND WE WANT TO MAKE AIR CLEAN I

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.257
THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL FOR THAT I

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:49.228
DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT DOESN'T

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:49.828
WANT. A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT BUT

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.698
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO.

00:13:52.765 --> 00:13:55.834
BUT JUST THE FACT THAT. YOU

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:56.435
CHANGE WHEN YOU CHANGE IT'S A

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:57.069
PENSIVE AND IT'S- AND IT'S ONLY

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:57.536
DAMAGING TO CALIFORNIA

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:58.437
RESIDENTS AND THEN ON TOP OF

00:13:58.504 --> 00:13:59.305
THAT AS YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:00.439
ME SAY THIS. MANY TIMES AND MAY

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:01.974
THE MEMBERS IS THAT. YOU KNOW I

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:03.175
THINK OUR FOCUS ON THE

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:06.545
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. IS MAYBE

00:14:06.612 --> 00:14:08.080
OR TO FOCUS TO AND LASER DOWN

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:09.648
ON TRANSPORTATION VERSES ALL

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.683
THE OTHER CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:14.320
THAT WE'RE- LIMITING OUT THERE

00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:14.954
AND IN A I TALK ABOUT WILD FIRE

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.091
AND HOW MUCH. LOSE WE PUT OUT

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:20.459
IN WILD FIRE AND END OF A COST.

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.060
THAT WERE PUSHING DOWN ON THE

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:23.128
ON THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.297
IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:27.433
WOULD BE HIGHLY OFFSET ABOUT

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:28.901
FOUR DOLLARS A TON TO DO FORCE

00:14:28.968 --> 00:14:30.402
MANAGEMENT VERSES IN SOME CASES

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.471
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HIGH SPEED

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.773
TRAIN HUNDREDS TO A MILLION

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.876
DOLLARS A TON THAT DOESN'T MAKE

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:38.477
SENSE TO ME SO FOR ME. I'M ALL

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.013
ABOUT. AIR BUT I WANT TO BRING

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.548
I WANNA ALLOW BUSINESSES IN

00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:43.649
CALIFORNIA TO HAVE AN

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:44.950
OPPORTUNITY TO STAY HERE AND

00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:47.653
THRIVE AND BE THE LEADER SO I

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.088
DID HEAR THE GOVERNOR SAY

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:50.155
YESTERDAY AND THAT YOU KNOW

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:51.323

THE GOVERNMENT COMES IN AND

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.241
CHANGES THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:09.842
GAME THAT WASN'T PART OF YOUR

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:12.578

I'M COMPETING IT'S AND SO I

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:19.952
JUST WANT TO. MOVE IS NOT THIS

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:22.321

00:15:22.388 --> 00:15:23.422
AUTHOR THIS BILL I'M LOOKING AT

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:24.823
YOU BECAUSE IT YOUR BILL BUT I

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.524
WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT HERE

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:26.725
BUT THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:27.893
CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT. THE

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.261
DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:31.196
CALIFORNIA. HER CALIFORNIA

WHERE IT IS THE LEAST EXPENSIVE

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:52.685
AND I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:53.252
THROUGH FORESTRY AND THROUGH

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:56.488
