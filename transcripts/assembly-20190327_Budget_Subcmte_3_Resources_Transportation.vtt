LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETER AND

RESOLVE CODE VIOLATIONS WITHOUT

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:32.864
HAVING TO GO TO COURT.

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:33.932
BECAUSE THE COSTA LIKE TO

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.000
STARKLY LOCKED LACK THIS

00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:36.034
AUTHORITY OUR ENFORCEMENT

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:37.702

OTHERWISE BE.

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:43.141
WITH NO THREAT OF FINANCIAL

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:44.743
PENALTY.

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:45.410
INTENSE LITIGATION IS A SLOW AND

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.444
EXPENSIVE MEANS TO COMPEL

00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:47.245
COMPLIANCE AND COLLECT PENALTIES

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:48.546
IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOME

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:49.881
VIOLATIONS TO PROTECT.

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.483
PERSIST FOR DECADES OR MORE

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:52.851
WITHOUT RESOLUTION.

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.252
CONSEQUENTLY THE COMMISSION'S

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.720
OPEN BACKLOG OF UNRESOLVED

00:25:55.787 --> 00:25:58.490
VIOLATIONS IS GOING TO TWO

00:25:58.556 --> 00:25:59.124
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WITH MORE

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.858
BEING ADDED EACH YEAR.

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:01.293
SECTION THROUGH A TWENTY ONE NOW

00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:02.360
ENABLES THE COMMISSION TO ASSESS

00:26:02.427 --> 00:26:04.162
PENALTIES FOR PUBLIC ACCESS

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:05.463
VIOLATIONS DIRECTLY.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.298
WHICH SAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:07.599
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:09.401
COMMISSION THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.036
AND THE COURTS THEMSELVES IT

00:26:11.102 --> 00:26:12.671
ALSO PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR

00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:14.606
VIOLATORS TO AVOID FINES BY

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.041
SETTLING VOLUNTARILY.

00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:17.442
WHICH LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:19.744
BETWEEN THOSE WHO FOLLOW THE LAW

00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:20.478
AND THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO IGNORE

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:20.879
IT.

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.113
THE DATA WE'VE COMPILED OVER THE

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.515
LAST FOUR YEARS HAS ALLOWED US

00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.050
TO COMPARE THE RELATIVE

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.484
EFFECTIVENESS AND READ A

00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:27.519
RESOLUTION FOR CLOSE TO LIKE

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:29.921
VIOLATIONS WITH AND WITHOUT

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.790
ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY AUTHORITY.

00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:33.158
OUR CURRENT PUBLIC ACCESS OF

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:35.160
CASELOAD IS FOUR HUNDRED AND

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:37.162
SEVENTY TWO CASES OR ROUGHLY 30%

00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:41.166
OF THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF TWO

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:41.700
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OPEN

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:42.133
VIOLATIONS.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.134
BECAUSE THIS IS MORE THAN WE

00:26:43.201 --> 00:26:43.802
COULD OP PROCESS THAT ONE TIME

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:44.602
WITH THEIR CURRENT STAFFING

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:46.371
LEVELS WE INITIALLY CONCENTRATED

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:48.073
ON THE PILOT PROJECT OF A

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.507
HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN CASES.

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:50.809
NOTIFYING THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS

00:26:50.875 --> 00:26:51.977
THAT THE VIOLATIONS WERE NOW

00:26:52.043 --> 00:26:54.079
SUBJECT TO THE POTENTIAL FINES

00:26:54.145 --> 00:26:55.413
UNDER THE NEW LAW.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.748
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE THIRTY DAY

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:58.249
GRACE PERIOD FOR PROPERTY OWNERS

00:26:58.316 --> 00:26:59.617
TO RESOLVE THE VIOLATIONS

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.785
VOLUNTARILY AND COMPLETELY AVOID

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:03.521
A PENALTY WE'RE PLEASED TO FIND

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:04.489
THAT MANY PARTIES WERE WILLING

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:06.024
TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS.

00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:07.525
AND COMPLY QUICKLY IN ORDER TO

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:09.627
AVOID PENALTIES IN FACT BECAUSE

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:10.996
OF OUR STAFFING CONSTRAINTS WE

00:27:11.062 --> 00:27:12.664
EXTENDED THE THIRTY DAYS IN MANY

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:14.265
CASES WHEN WE HAVE PARTIES WERE

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:15.266
WILLING TO SETTLE.

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:17.502
AND FOR THEIR ACCOMMODATED MORE

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:18.303
PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:18.937
COOPERATE.

00:27:19.004 --> 00:27:21.439
SO AS A RESULT IN NINETY SIX OF

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:23.141
THE INITIAL ONE HUNDRED AND

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:24.476
THIRTY SEVEN CASES OR MORE THAN

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:29.948
AT ALL.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.116
SOME OF THESE VIOLATIONS HAVE

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:32.617
BEEN PREVIOUSLY PERSISTING FOR

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:33.685
MANY YEARS WITH NO MOVEMENT

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:35.720
TOWARDS COMPLIANCE DESPITE

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:37.088
EFFORTS BY COMMISSION STAFF.

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.323
IN EACH OF THESE VIOLATIONS THAT

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.058
REMAINED IN PLACE FOR YEARS HAD

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.960
A CON COMMITMENT THE LACK OF

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:44.229
PUBLIC ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC.

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:45.730
EIGHT CASES REQUIRED FORMAL

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.465
COMMISSION ACTION BECAUSE OF THE

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.300
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE VIOLATIONS

00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:50.435
THE NATURE OF THE WORK RESULT

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:52.837
REQUIRED TO RESOLVE THEM OR THE

00:27:52.904 --> 00:27:54.205
PARTY'S REFUSAL TO SETTLE. SIX

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:36.414
MEDICATION WHICH IS A VERY.

00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:38.483
LOW RATE INMUCH LOWER THAN THE

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.518
RATE -- PRIOR TO THE EGGMAN

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:41.619
PENALTIES.

00:28:41.686 --> 00:28:42.887
A REVIEW OF OUR PUBLIC ACCESS

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.589
CASES SHOWS THAT HISTORICALLY IT

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.758
TOOK AN AVERAGE OF ONE THOUSAND

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:47.525

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:10.548
IT'S ACTUALLY A STUNNING OUTCOME

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:11.082
IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN WE

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:13.118
EXPECTED THE POTENTIAL FOR FINES

00:29:13.184 --> 00:29:14.486

00:31:04.295 --> 00:31:06.030
REALLY STRONG INDICATION THAT IT

PERMITTED TO PARK -- THAT THAT

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.090

ISSUE SPECIFIC BASELINE

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:41.011
ADJUSTMENT BUT IN SAYING THAT WE

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:55.292
AMANDA MR MULLIN.

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.827
I DON'T LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:39:56.894 --> 00:39:58.395
AND I KEEP MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT

00:39:58.462 --> 00:39:59.497
THE COST TO RENT.

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:01.265
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU THAT --

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:03.734
WHEN I SEE THE FACT THAT?

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.836
THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ONE POINT

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:07.104
THREE MILLION WAS ADDED FOR THE

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.039
RENT.

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:09.940
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A LONG

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:12.409
TIME AGO AND NOW TO HAVE ONE

00:40:12.476 --> 00:40:15.579
POINT.

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.782
FOUR ADDED ON TOP OF THAT.

00:40:17.848 --> 00:40:21.085
THAT CAUSES ME GREAT CONCERN.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:23.220
AND I HEAR THE EXPLANATION ABOUT

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:24.889
THE NEED TO BE CLOSE BY AND I

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.357
HEAR THE EXPLANATION ABOUT.

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:27.925
YOU KNOW THIS IS A COST.

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.528
OF BEING IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:32.797
BUT IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY DO

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:34.665
WE HAVE TO BE IN SAN FRANCISCO I

00:40:34.732 --> 00:40:39.270
RECOGNIZE IT'S CONVENIENT. FOR

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.404
FOR FOR EMPLOYEES FOR STAFF

00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:40.704
[inaudible]

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:45.075
BUT THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:46.944
AND TO HAVE IT MORE THAN DOUBLE

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:48.813
FROM LAST YEAR.

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:50.214
I I DO HAVE.

00:40:50.281 --> 00:40:51.682
SERIOUS CONCERNS A LOOK FURTHER

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:54.151
INTO IT BUT I I DO HAVE SERIOUS

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:56.453
CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND THE FACT

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.621
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE THE

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:58.823
THE THE THAT THERE WAS NOT IN

00:40:58.889 --> 00:40:59.590
WRITING.

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.091
MY DAD DIDN'T TELL ME TO GET IN

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.426
WRITING BUT IN LAW SCHOOL THEY

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:03.527
TOLD ME YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:04.628
UNLESS YOU HAVE IT IN WRITING.

00:41:04.695 --> 00:41:07.998
SO IT IS OF GREAT CONCERN -- AND

00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:10.401
I WANTED TO BE SURE TO VOICE

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:13.370
THEM AND MR TERRIFY BAY -- HALF

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:14.171
OF THE COST IS FOR TEN

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:15.372
IMPROVEMENT COSTS THOSE COSTS

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:16.774
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCURRED HAD

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.209
BECAUSE COMMISSION BEEN ABLE TO

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:20.144
STAY IN THEIR CURRENT FACILITY --

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:22.646
SO THEY INCREASES ABOUT SIX

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:23.247
HUNDRED THOUSAND OUT THE FULL

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.648
ONE POINT TWO BUT JUST ONE POINT

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:27.918
UP.

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:31.188
RIGHT THERE ARE NOT HAPPY.

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:32.556
I DON'T THINK -- THAT IN

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:34.225
NEGOTIATING -- THAT THE THE

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:35.259
COMMISSION DID ANYTHING WRONG

00:41:35.326 --> 00:41:36.427
HERE WHEN I HAD MY LITTLE

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:38.662
COMMENT ABOUT -- GETTING IT IN

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:41.098
WRITING PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONS

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.666
AND DISCUSSIONS ARE ALWAYS

00:41:42.733 --> 00:41:44.168
VERBAL AND STE THEN YOU REACH A

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:45.603
POINT WHERE YOU START.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.471
TO A REDUCE THINGS TO TO WRITING

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:49.173
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE IN

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.141
THOSE PRELIMINARY STAGES YOU

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.476
THOUGHT YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:56.247
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO AND THEN --

00:41:56.313 --> 00:41:57.181
THE OWNER OF THE BUILDING OR THE

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:58.282
LANDLORD FOR WHATEVER REASON

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.651
DECIDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

RISING PCA.

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:03.888
A PRICES IT SAID.

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:05.856
IS THAT ESSENTIALLY CORRECT YES

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:07.291
THAT'S RIGHT AND MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.893

REQUIRED TO BE OUR HEADQUARTERS

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:12.129

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:16.233
COASTAL COUNT -- SO ANY OF OUR

COASTAL AREAS.

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:18.636
EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS OF COURSE

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:20.704
SAN FRANCISCO IS BONKERS AND IT

00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:21.472
IS ALL HIGHER ANYWHERE WITHIN

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:23.040
THE BAY AREA WE LOOKED AROUND

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:26.076
OTHER OTHER AREAS -- IN AND IT

00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:28.979
WAS VERY COST PROHIBITIVE -- THE

EMISSIONS OVER THE COMING

DECADES BUT WE SEE THAT EVEN AT

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.958
THE MINIMAL LEVELS THEY WILL

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.493

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.528
THE HAVE IMPACTS OF COURSE A

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:39.196

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:56.146
ALREADY SEEN IN SOME RECENT

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.916
STORMS -- PERIODIC IN ADDITION

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.551
THAT WILL BE EQUALLY DAMAGING.

00:47:00.617 --> 00:47:02.286
SO THE STATE'S GOT MULTIPLE

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.453
DEPARTMENTS WORKING ON THIS

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.955

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.375
THERE HAS BEEN FUNDING PROVIDED

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.677
FOR THESE AGENCIES IN THE PAST

00:49:06.743 --> 00:49:07.644
COUPLE OF YEARS THOSE HAVE BEEN

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:09.313
ADDITIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:09.379 --> 00:49:10.647
AND YEAR IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:11.682
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:12.649
PREVIOUSLY.

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.351
AND THEY HAVE BEEN PROVIDED ON A

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:15.852
ONE YEAR AT A TIME BASIS SO THIS

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.020
IS A DIFFERENCE IN THAT IT'S

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:17.788
COMING BEFORE YOU OF THE

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:19.389
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND FOR ON

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:21.224
GOING -- FOR THE COASTAL

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:22.559
COMMISSION IT'S FOR TO CONTINUE

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.261
THE WORK THEY'VE BEEN DOING FOR

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.495
BE CDC HAS THEY'LL EXPLAIN IT'S

00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:27.331
IT'S MORE AND FOR THE IN

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:28.065
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.866
THERE IS NOT FUNDING AS YOU CAN

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:31.668
SEE IN THE CHART PROPOSED FOR

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:32.969
THAT BECAUSE OF CONSERVANCY THAT

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.471
CLIMATE READY PROGRAM AS HAS

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:38.175
BEEN PROVIDED IN PRE IN THE PAST

00:49:38.241 --> 00:49:40.711
COUPLE OF YEARS -- TURNING TO

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:41.645
PAGE THREE JUST SOME

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:42.913
CONSIDERATIONS WE WOULD

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.081
HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU.

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.549
IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.150
THAT MOST OF THE PLANNING AND

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.118
RESPONSE.

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:49.519
RESPONSIBILITIES REALLY DO LIE

00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:50.954
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MOST OF THE

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:52.723
PROPERTY IS EITHER OWNED BY

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:53.857
PRIVATE ENTITIES ARE LOCAL

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:54.958
GOVERNMENTS.

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:56.393
MOST OF THE DECISION MAKING OVER

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.562
LAND USE POLICIES IS AT THE

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.464
LOCAL LEVEL -- SO PRIMARY FISCAL

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.865
RESPONSIBILITY IS ALSO AT THE

00:50:01.932 --> 00:50:04.668
LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.069
MEAN THE STATE SHOULD JUST WIPE

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:06.937
ITS HANDS AND WALK AWAY BECAUSE

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:08.438
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A HUGE STATE

00:50:08.505 --> 00:50:09.706
INTEREST IN.

00:50:09.773 --> 00:50:11.975
WHAT HAPPENS ALONG THE COAST AND

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:13.977
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- FROM

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.012
HEALTH AND SAFETY PERSPECTIVE --

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.214
WHAT HAPPENS TO CRITICAL

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.249
INFRASTRUCTURE THE HUGE

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.984
POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC IMPACTS

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.352
THERE WAS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:23.220
FROM THE?

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:24.721
US GEOLOGICAL SERVICE A COUPLE

00:50:24.788 --> 00:50:26.490
OF WEEKS AGO THAT ESTIMATED A

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.491
HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:29.626
DOLLARS AT RISK IN PROPERTY

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.261
ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST --

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:31.962
AND THEN THE STATE OWNS

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:33.964
INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL HIGHWAYS

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.098
OUR STATE BEACHES AND STATE

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.534
PARKS ALONG THE COAST.

00:50:37.601 --> 00:50:39.936
AND WE ARE THE PUBLIC TRUST --

00:50:40.003 --> 00:50:41.571
ENTITY THAT'S IN CHARGE OF OUR

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:43.573
NATURAL RESOURCES AND AND PUBLIC

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.710
ACCESS OF THE STATE SO -- VERY

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:48.011
STRONG INTEREST IN THE STATE SO

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:50.480
BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THE

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:51.415
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS --

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.517
REPRESENT IMPORTANT MEET

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.986
IMPORTANT NEEDS -- OBVIOUSLY THE

00:50:56.052 --> 00:50:57.621
NEEDS ARE GREATER THAN THESE

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:59.356
HOWEVER AND SO WELL WHAT WE

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:00.323
WOULD WE WOULD RECOMMEND

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.691
ADOPTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:02.859
BUT ALSO.

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.428
REALLY STARTING TODAY AGAIN AND

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.096
THINK ABOUT WHAT ELSE OUR LOCAL

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:07.063
COMMUNITIES GONNA NEED FROM THE

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.099
STATE BOTH ON THE FISCAL SIDE

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.500
AND HOW CAN STATE DOLLARS BE

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.369
USED MOST EFFECTIVELY BUT ARE

00:51:12.436 --> 00:51:13.904
THERE POLICY CHANGES AS WELL

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.872
THAT WILL HELP FACILITATE.

00:51:15.939 --> 00:51:18.008
THE HEAVY LEFT THAT WILL -- THAT

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:21.645
IS FACING LOCAL COASTAL

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:22.913
COMMUNITIES.

00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:24.281
SO ON THAT NOTE JUST TURNING TO

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:25.982
PAGE -- FOUR I THINK YOUR STAFF

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:26.650
HAS PUT THESE IN YOUR AGENDA AS

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:27.484
WELL THESE ARE SOME KEY

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.985
LEGISLATIVE QUESTIONS THAT WE

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:31.421
WOULD SUGGEST -- YOU FOCUS ON

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.890
NOT JUST TODAY BUT IN THE MONTHS

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.725
AND THE YEARS TO COME.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:36.893
I THINK ONE OF THE REALLY KEY

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.228
ONES THIS FIRST BILL IT WHAT IS

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.596
THE STATE ROLE AS COMPARED TO

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:41.298
THE LOCAL ROLE AND WHERE IS THE

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:42.833
STATE RESPONSE AND WORK IN THE

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.501
STATE PROVIDE THE GREATEST VALUE.

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:45.869
AS COMPARED TO AT THE LOCAL

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:46.837
LEVEL.

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.405
HOW IS PROGRESS BEING MADE AT

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:49.406
THE LOCAL LEVEL AND ARE THERE

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:51.274
STATE ACTIONS THAT THAT THAT CAN

00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:53.109
HELP FACILITATE EITHER THREE

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:54.945
CARATS ARTHUR STICKS? TO HELP

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:56.246
ENSURE THAT PROGRESS IS BEING

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:58.982
MADE WHAT ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.150
USES OF STATE FUNDING ON WHAT

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:01.651
ARE THE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:03.720
ARE THERE ADDITIONAL -- TOOLS

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.388
THAT MAYBE COULD BE USED AT THE

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:07.090
STATE LEVEL OR THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:08.792
TO GENERATE OR MAKE AVAILABLE

00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:11.528
ADDITION ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:12.295
FUNDING.

THE STATE HAS BEEN AND CAN

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:14.498
CONTINUE TO BE HELPFUL IN

00:52:14.564 --> 00:52:17.934

HELP GUIDE THEIR PLANNING AND AS

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.007
SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDINGS CHANGE

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:24.941
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:52:25.008 --> 00:52:26.343

BEEN IDENTIFIED.

00:53:01.144 --> 00:53:02.212
AND THEN FINALLY THE FINAL BILL

00:53:02.279 --> 00:53:03.713

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.494
GO THROUGH THE THE PRESENTATION

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:12.061
I KNOW THAT.

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:13.930
MR MULLIN IS SEEING THEM WHICH

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:16.666
DEMONSTRATES THAT WHAT BC DC

01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:19.168
DOES AS WE PERMIT PROJECTS.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.838
IS WE HAVE RAISED WE ARE FORCED

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.506
THOSE PROJECTS TO BE ELEVATED.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.074
SO IF YOU WALK ALONG THE SAN

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.976
FRANCISCO EMBARCADERO YOU'LL SEE

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.344
THAT AS THE NEW FERRY TERMINAL

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.546
IS BEING BUILT IT IS AT A HIGHER

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.014
ELEVATION DISTINCTLY HIGHER

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:33.649
ELEVATION THAN THE OLD

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:35.184
AGRICULTURE BUILDING NEXT TO IT.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.686
ENDED FOR YOU IF WE HAD

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.754
PERMITTED IT NEARLY SIX MONTHS

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:39.589
AGO INSTEAD OF TWO AND A HALF

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.157
YEARS AGO IT WOULD BE HIGHER

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.125
STILL.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.694
BE CDC DIRECTLY PERMITS THOSE

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.496
TYPES OF PROJECTS LET ME KNOW

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:48.030
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MISTER

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:50.133
CHAIRMAN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS SAY

01:02:50.199 --> 01:02:52.068
AT THREE FEET BETWEEN TWO AND

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:53.102
THREE FEET.

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:56.339
IMAGINE THE BAY AREA AND IMAGINE

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:57.140
THAT THE BAY IS A BIG BATHTUB.

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:58.741
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS

01:02:58.808 --> 01:03:00.343
IT'S A SHALLOW BATHTUB IT IS

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.245
SURROUNDED BY HILLS.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.447
ON A SUNNY DAY WITH THREE FEET

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:05.748
OF RISING SEA LEVEL WE'RE NOT

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:07.450
TALKING ABOUT A STORM THE STORM

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.119
SURGE OR OR OR OR EN EL NINO.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.922
SFO ACCESS BASICALLY IS CLOSED

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:15.892
OUT OF HIGHWAY ONE A ONE US ONE

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.560
NO ONE IS GOING TO BE CLOSED

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.662
AROUND SANDRA FELL INTO BRAUN.

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:22.031
AND CERTAINLY AROUND SAN MATTEO

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:24.667
AVENUE IN THAT AREA AND ALL --

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.402
HIGHWAY.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.503
THIRTY SEVEN BASICALLY GOING TO

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.871
BE CLOSED IN VARIOUS POINTS.

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.606
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT RAIL AND

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:31.774
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT BART IT IS

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:34.377
POSSIBLE THAT A PARTS OF BARTON

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.845
MAY WELL BE CLOSED?

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.113
CERTAINLY YOU MAY OR MAY NOT

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.614
REMEMBER.

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.516
THAT A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THERE

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.618
IS A FIVE YEAR STORM.

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:45.021
THE EMBARCADERO AND MONTGOMERY

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:48.491
MUNY STATIONS WERE CLOSED.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.661
SO YOU CAN SORT OF ENVISION THAT

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:54.397
A TRANSPORTATION NETWORK.

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:56.332
WHICH IS DEFINED AS BEING ABLE

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:57.667
TO GET FROM HERE TO THERE TO

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.602
THERE BY USING DIFFERENT TYPES

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.370
OF TRANSPORTATION OR DIFFERENT

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.439
ROADS IS GOING TO BE SEVERELY

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.141
AFFECTED BY SAY THREE FEET OF

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.442
RISING SEA LEVEL.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.843
THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT WHAT

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.779
WILL HAPPEN TO HOMES AND TO

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.113
BUSINESSES.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.848
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT AT

01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:14.784
THREE FEET YOU MAY SEE AS MANY

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.019
AS TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES.

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.789
TAKING IN WATER AROUND THE BAY

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.389
AREA.

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:24.393
AND DOESN'T AND THAT DOES NOT

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.329
INCLUDE BUSINESSES SUCH AS LAND

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:27.997
DECKER YA WHO WERE DEL OR

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:30.399
SEAGATE ALL OF WHOM WILL NO

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:32.735
DOUBT SOMEHOW HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.403
POSSIBLY GETTING WHACKED.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.606
THAT'S THREE FEET OF RISING SEA

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:40.076
LEVEL AT A STORM ADDED EL NINO

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:41.978
AND YOU'RE RELEASING SOME KIND

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.780
OF PATTERN THAT WE REALLY NEED

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:46.983
THE PLAN AGAINST AND WE NEED TO

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:50.519
PLAN -- FOR AND SO WHAT WE DO A.

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:51.854
B. C. D. C..

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:55.091
IS. TO LEAD THE LOCAL

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.592
GOVERNMENTS AND THE SPECIAL

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:59.328
DISTRICTS IN WORKING NOT ONLY ON

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.197
THEIR OWN PLANS WITH OUR HELP

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.765
AND WITH OUR DATA.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:04.967
BUT ALSO WORKING TOGETHER AND I

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:05.835
THINK THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:07.270
IMPORTANT TO NOTE ABOUT HERE

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:10.673
BECAUSE THE BAY IS A NETWORK IN

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.008
SO MANY WAYS.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:14.010
AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:15.778
IS THAT THERE'S A REGIONAL

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:18.914
SOLUTION FOR THIS SO THAT IF SAN

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:21.117
MATTEO COUNTY.

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.752
DECIDES TO BUILD SOMETHING

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.587
WHETHER IT BE A LEVY OR WHETHER

01:05:24.654 --> 01:05:26.722
IT BE A WALL SOMEWHERE WE NEED

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:28.257
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS PUT

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:30.359
INTO FOR EXAMPLE THE WHOLE

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:31.627
REGIONAL CONTEXT.

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:33.229
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WATER

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.698
MOVES AND SO AND WE'VE ALL

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:36.932
LEARNED THAT.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:40.002
MOVES TO SOME EXTENT NORTH.

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:42.772
AND SO AS A RESULT BECAUSE WATER

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:44.040
REFLEX WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:46.075
REGIONAL SHORELINE ADAPTATION

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:48.744
PLAN WHICH ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:51.113
NEED TO ENSURE THAT.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.982
ONE ASPECT OF RESILIENCE OVER

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:55.318
HERE DOESN'T CAUSE FLOODING OVER

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.253
THERE.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.888
AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.790
WITH THE G. G. R. F. FUNDS IN

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.825
ADDITION TO BOLSTERING OUR STAFF

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.794
WHICH HAS BEEN DOING RISING SEA

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.463
LEVEL ON SMALL GRANTS THAT ARE

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.864
SHORT TERM.

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.266
AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:11.567
OVER A DOZEN YEARS WILL ACTUALLY

01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.369
BE SUPPORTED ALMOST FULLY BY THE

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:14.370
STATE.

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:15.938
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TO OUR

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.240
ADAPTING TO RISING TIDES PROGRAM

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.676
IS CREATING WITH CALTRANS AND

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:21.410
WITH THE METROPOLITAN

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:22.445
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THE

01:06:22.511 --> 01:06:24.447
FIRST EVER FULL SCALE

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.182
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS?

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:27.650
OF THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

01:06:27.717 --> 01:06:28.617
AROUND.

01:06:28.684 --> 01:06:30.086
THE BAY.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.420
AND IN MANY RESPECTS THAT

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:32.955
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK NOW

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:35.257
SERVES AS DE FACTO FLOOD

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:37.493
PROTECTION ONE OH ONE AND THE

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.362
OTHER AND THE OTHER IN AND MAJOR

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:41.731
ROADS LITERALLY ARE.

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.699
DE FACTO FLOOD PROTECTION BUT

01:06:43.766 --> 01:06:46.268
WHAT BC DC IS DOING IS MORPHING

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:47.803
THAT KIND OF VULNERABILITY

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:49.739
ANALYSIS TO OUR ADAPTING RISING

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:51.707
TIDES PROGRAM THIS YEAR.

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.642
AND MOVING IT INTO A REGIONAL

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:55.611
SHORELINE ADAPTATION PLANNED

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:56.512
PROGRAM.

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.214
AND WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.815
DO AS WE START THAT FRAMEWORK

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.851
THIS YEAR IS TO FINISH THAT

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.853
FRAMEWORK BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:04.920
AND THAT DATE IS INCREDIBLY

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.322
IMPORTANT TO US AND THE REASON

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.523
THAT DATES IMPORTANT.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.458
IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE NEXT TIME

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.026
THAT A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:13.763
STRATEGY PLAN BAY AREA WILL

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.231
ACTUALLY COME TO THE FORE.

01:07:15.297 --> 01:07:17.099
AND WE NEED THAT SUSTAINABLE

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:19.769
COMMUNITY STRATEGY TO BE IN

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:20.669
ALIGNMENT WITH.

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:21.737
OUR REGIONAL SHORELINE

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.105
ADAPTATION PLAN.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:24.507
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO FIT

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:25.975
TOGETHER THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.276
LIKE THIS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:28.978
BE PART OF EACH OTHER BUT THEY

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:30.613
NEED TO BE A LINE.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:31.747
AND THAT'S WHY THESE FUNDS ARE

01:07:31.814 --> 01:07:33.916
SO IMPORTANT FOR US SO WE LOOK

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.918
AT THIS REGIONALLY AND WE HAVE

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.720
AN EASIER JOB THAN JACK IN ONE

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.221
RESPECT BECAUSE OUR REGION IS

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:42.024
VERY MUCH SORT OF SELF CONTAINED.

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:43.893
BUT ALSO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:44.994
THE BAY SHORELINE AND THIS IS

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.363
HOW ALL AND THERE IS EVERYTHING

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:48.964
FROM HOUSES.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:51.033
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN MANY

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.537
RESPECTS TO LARGE SCALE INDUSTRY

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:57.006
TO AGRICULTURE OPEN SPACE PARKS

01:07:57.072 --> 01:07:58.541
AND THE LIKE AND WE NEED TO MAKE

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.543
SURE THAT ADAPTATION PLAN CAN

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.311
ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THAT.

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:04.313
LET ME FINISH BY SAYING THIS IS

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.781
THE TEXAS COASTAL PLAINS.

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:08.317
GOES FROM BASICALLY LOUISIANA

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:09.985
DOWN TOWARD COPE CORPUS CHRISTI.

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:12.054
THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.722
WHO LIVE RIGHT ON THE COAST IN

01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.491
THAT AREA AT LEAST COMPARED TO

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:16.792
THE BAY AREA THERE APPEARED SOME

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.027
CERTAINLY.

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.528
AND MOST OF HOUSTON OF COURSE

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:20.663
YOU'RE MEMBERS INLAND ALTHOUGH

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:21.864
GALVESTON ISN'T.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.466
THIS TOOK THEM A FEW YEARS TO

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:25.134
MAKE AND IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:26.101
NATURE.

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:27.570
IMAGINE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:28.637
TO DO WITH THE REGIONAL

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.272
SHORELINE ADAPTATION PLAN THAT

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.574
DEALS WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.842
BAY SHORE LINE.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.376
IT'S A LOT OF WORK AND WE THANK

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:36.579
YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.848
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO HAVE ANY

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:40.549
QUESTIONS MR MALL.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.184
JUST A COMMENT.

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:43.786
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- FOR

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:44.920
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:46.188
ISSUE AS A MATTER OF FACT I WANT

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.656
TO THANK THE DIRECTOR -- FOR

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:50.025
PAINTING THE PICTURE HERE AND

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.327
AND ILLUSTRATING.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.591
PIECE IS REALLY ABOUT VULNERABLE

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.226
COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR I KNOW

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:39.428
WE OFTEN CAN CAN CONSIDER THAT

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:41.530
JUST BY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.165
THE ONES THAT LIVE ON THE COAST.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:43.999
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.601
POCKETS ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:46.602
BAY OR ALONG THAT THE CENTRAL

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:48.270
COAST WHERE YOU DO HAVE A VERY

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:49.805
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES -- THERE

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:51.173
ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE JUST

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.207

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:04.386
ELEMENT.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:05.921
AND I'LL I'LL START IT OFF AND

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.590
TURN IT OVER TO FILL -- THE WHAT

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:10.492
MAKES THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION --

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.561
SO UNIQUE AS THE STATE'S

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.129
LANDLORD AS WAS EARLIER

01:17:14.196 --> 01:17:16.665
REFERENCE -- REFERENCE IS THAT

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:19.001
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO -- STARTS

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.569
WITH THE POINT ON THE GROUND ARE

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.904
THE STATE'S OWNERSHIP AND A LOT

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:26.475
OF THAT -- INFORMATION ABOUT

01:17:26.541 --> 01:17:28.710
THOSE OWNERS THAT OWNERSHIP

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.579
DATES BACK PRIOR TO STATEHOOD

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:32.514
AND SO WHEN WE GET REQUESTS

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.449
ABOUT WHAT THE STATE'S OWNERSHIP

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:36.418
IS IN CERTAIN TIED IN SOMERS

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:37.819
LANDS ARE NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS.

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:40.422
WERE ON A DAILY BASIS ACCESSING

BACK PRIOR TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY AND

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:47.896
THEN MOVING THROUGH TIME -- AS

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:49.631
THAT LAND OWNERSHIP OF ALL TO

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:58.774
YEARS.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.909
AND THE WAY WE DO THAT IN HOUSE

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.278
IS MANUALLY WE HAVE A MANUAL

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:08.450
TITLE PLANT -- THAT TO DETERMINE

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.285

THAT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL STAGE

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.494
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THE

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:21.196
MAJORITY OF THAT RESEARCH AND

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:25.434
ANALYTICAL WORK -- USING -- GIS

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.937

AND THEN -- ALSO AT THE END PART

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.280
OF THIS PROJECT IS TO TURN THIS

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:40.749

MIGRATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:50.638
SEVENTEEN IT'S BEEN NO EASY FEAT --

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:51.239
BUT WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:51.873

SOME OF THEM I WOULD SAY WERE IN

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:57.078
THE BUCKET OF THINGS THAT WE

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.680
ANTICIPATED.

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.014
AND SOME OF THE THINGS I WOULD

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:00.815
SAY YOU'RE PROBABLY LESSONS

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.951
LEARNED WE'RE FAIRLY UNIQUE

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:04.385
DEPARTMENT LAW I KNOW EVERY

01:27:04.452 --> 01:27:06.020
DEPARTMENT THINKS THAT ABOUT

01:27:06.087 --> 01:27:08.056
THEMSELVES WHAT MAKES A SOMEWHAT

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.691
UNIQUELY CHALLENGED AS THE

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.993
VOLUME OF FUNDS THAT WE HAVE.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.296
WE ALSO COLLECT REVENUES -- WE

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.864
ALSO MAKE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.866
PAYMENTS TO VENDORS ACROSS THE

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.602
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.403
CAN IMAGINE WE'RE NOT LOCATED IN

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.372
LARGE URBAN AREAS WITH MANY MANY

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:25.239
MANY VENDORS.

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:26.975
BUT WERE OFTEN REMOTELY LOCATED

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.242
WHERE THE NUMBER OF VENDORS ARE

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:30.311
SOMEWHAT LIMITED SO BEING ABLE

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:31.713
TO MAKE TIMELY PAYMENT TO THE

01:27:31.779 --> 01:27:32.947
VENDORS ARE REALLY KEY.

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.282
I'M GONNA SHARE -- SOME

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:37.385
STATISTICS WITH YOU -- THAT KIND

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:38.386
OF MAKE US A LITTLE MORE

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:42.290
UNIQUELY POSITIONED RELATIVE TO

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:45.560
OTHER DEPARTMENTS -- I WOULD SAY.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:46.928
WELL WELL FIRST I SHOULD SAME

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:48.296
YOU KNOW WHEN WE DID THE

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:50.064
MIGRATION IN TWO THOUSAND

01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.199
SEVENTEEN I THINK WE WE TREAT

01:27:51.265 --> 01:27:52.467
ALL OF THE WORKLOAD AS IT WAS AS

01:27:52.533 --> 01:27:53.568
IF IT WAS GONNA BE ONE TIME IN

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:54.736
NATURE BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:57.038
PREMATURE. TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:58.106
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH OF THIS

01:27:58.172 --> 01:27:59.507
WOULD BE ON GOING SO WE

01:27:59.574 --> 01:28:00.875
RESPONDED.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:03.177
IN A ONE TIME NATURE WE HIRED

01:28:03.244 --> 01:28:05.480
TEMPORARY STAFF WE ASKED OUR

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:07.148
STAFF TO KIND OF RISE TO THE

01:28:07.215 --> 01:28:09.317
OCCASION AND DO OVERTIME SORRY

01:28:09.384 --> 01:28:10.518
ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS SERVICES

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:12.286
STAFF DID OVER TEN THOUSAND

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:13.421
HOURS OF OVERTIME.

01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:14.522
TYPICALLY PEOPLE IN THOSE

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:16.391
POSITIONS UNDERSTANDS THAT WE

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.892
EXPECT OVER TIME BUT THAT

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.427
THERE'S A SEASONALITY TO IT AND

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:21.095
WE'VE NOT SEEN A SEASONALITY

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.864
THAT THIS IS A CONTINUE TO STAND

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.198
LEVEL OF OVERTIME.

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:26.501
WE ALSO -- TREATED THIS IS AN

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:28.436
ALL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT -- WE

01:28:28.503 --> 01:28:30.772
HAD FOLKS OUT IN THE FIELD AND

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.974
OUT IN OUR TWENTY ONE DISTRICTS --

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.376
INCLUDING PEOPLE IN HEADQUARTERS --

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:38.046
SHARING IN RE DIRECTING STAFF TO

01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:40.048
ALSO HELP AUGMENT THIS EFFORT.

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.416
SO I THINK WELL THAT WAS A

01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:42.617
REALLY SMART WAY TO APPROACH

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.619
THIS AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.187
IN THE NEAR TERM WE STILL HAVE

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:48.156
NOT BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME KIND

01:28:48.222 --> 01:28:49.657
OF THE THEIR GROWING BACKLOG OF

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:50.892
WORK LET THAT WE HAVE.

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:53.461
WE ALSO NOT ONLY DO THE BUDGET

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.129
FOR OUR OWN ORGANIZATION THE

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:56.497
DEPARTMENT PARKS AND RECREATION

01:28:56.564 --> 01:28:58.900
BUT WE ALSO PRODUCE THE BUDGET

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:02.403
AND THE FISCAL ON INFORMATION.

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.305
FOR THREE SMALLER CONSERVANCY'S --

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:06.674
THE BALDWIN HILLS CONSERVANCY

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:07.975
CONSERVANCY IN THE COACHELLA

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:10.378
VALLEY MOUNTAINS SO THAT ALSO --

01:29:10.445 --> 01:29:15.750
PROVIDES A LAYER OF COMPLEXITY

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:17.518
SO IN TERMS OF NO WE ALSO

01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:18.553
CREATED SOME INTERNAL DATABASES

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:19.554
THAT HELP TO KIND OF AUTOMATE

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.555
SOME THINGS.

01:29:20.621 --> 01:29:21.989
SO IT'S A COMBINATION IN TERMS

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:23.091
OF THE ON GOING RECORD ITS

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:24.759
COMBINATION OF TRACKING SOME

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.427
THINGS THAT IN THE PAST WE

01:29:26.494 --> 01:29:27.595
HADN'T TRACK BECAUSE WE'RE

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.464
TRYING TO MEET A HIGHER STANDARD

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:30.732
OF ACCOUNTING IN THE STATE OF

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.166
CALIFORNIA NOW.

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:32.667
AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF

01:29:32.734 --> 01:29:34.602
TRANSPARENCY BUT THEN THE OTHER

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:35.636
THING I WOULD SAY THAT THERE

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:38.072
WERE SOME ACTIVITIES THAT WE MAY

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:39.974
HAVE DONE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:41.542
QUARTERLY BASIS OR A MONTHLY

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:42.577
BASIS.

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.212
THAT NOW WE'RE HAVING TO DO ON A

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:46.447
DAILY BASIS WEEKLY BASIS AND

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:47.648
WE'RE HAVING TO DO THE MORE

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:50.418
FREQUENTLY -- SO I THINK IN THE

01:29:50.485 --> 01:29:52.253
LONG TERM I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.287
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR THE STATE

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:54.889
OF CALIFORNIA BUT YOU'RE KIND OF

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:56.958
CATCHING US RIGHT IN NOT RIGHT

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:58.559
IN THAT KIND OF MOMENT IN TIME

01:29:58.626 --> 01:29:59.761
WHERE WERE FIGURING THIS OUT.

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:01.295
THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE BEFORE

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:03.765
YOU TODAY I MUST SAY WE DID NOT

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.199
PRESENT THIS TO YOU LIGHTLY --

01:30:05.266 --> 01:30:06.534
OR APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.003
FINANCE LIGHTLY -- THIS REQUEST

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.105
IS INTENDED TO BE A NOT A FACT

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:13.674
OF SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT A ONE

01:30:13.741 --> 01:30:15.143
TIME WORKLOAD DECLINING.

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:17.245
AND THEN WITH THE NOT A FACT OF

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:21.215
WHAT WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:23.317
ON GOING WORKLOAD.

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:23.818
IF I MAY FOLLOW UP -- I

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:24.786
APPRECIATE THE THE INFORMATION

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.854
ARE YOU PROVIDING THAT AS IS

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.623
FISCALE OPEN TO YOUR SUGGESTIONS

01:30:28.689 --> 01:30:30.224
IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THESE

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.259
CHALLENGES.

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:34.195
AS AS THE BEING UNIQUE AGENCY AB

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:35.663
I I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND I

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:38.599
UNDERSTAND THAT -- I THINK THE

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:39.700
CHALLENGE FOR US IS THAT.

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.335
UNFORTUNATELY YOU'RE NOT UNIQUE

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:44.939
IN THE IN THE AND WHAT'S

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.240
HAPPENING WITH FISCAL WITH OTHER

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:47.675
AGENCIES IN THE AND THEIR

01:30:47.742 --> 01:30:49.110
DIFFICULTIES AS WELL SO ARE YOU

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:49.977
ARE YOU.

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.013
IS FISCAL ASKING YOU FOR YOUR

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:54.015
INPUT AND HOW TO IMPROVE AND ARE

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:56.184
THEY LISTENING -- YES I THINK

01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:58.085
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY CONDUCTED THE

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:00.021
MIGRATION THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:02.190
STAFF COLLABORATION -- I CAN SAY

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:03.658
EVEN MYSELF I'M NOT A SHY

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.693
DIRECTOR AND I COME FROM A BIT

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.994
OF IT IN MINISTRY OF IN FISCAL

01:31:07.061 --> 01:31:08.462
BACKGROUND SO I WASN'T SIGNED

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:09.864
JUMPING ON MYSELF.

01:31:09.931 --> 01:31:10.765
AND ATTENDING SOME OF THE

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:12.834
MEETINGS WE ACTUALLY KIND OF HAD

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.902
ON GOING ON MEETINGS WERE FISCAL

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.637
STAFF FOR EMBEDDED WITHIN OUR

01:31:16.704 --> 01:31:18.105
ORGANIZATION.

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.040
AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT I CAN

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:20.107
TELL IS EVERYONE'S WORKING WELL

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:21.509
TOGETHER IS THAT WHEN I STEP IN

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:23.010

01:31:23.077 --> 01:31:24.378
MEETINGS EVERYBODY KNOWS EACH

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.615
YOU CAN TELL THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:31:27.682 --> 01:31:29.450
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME --

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:31.853
INITIALLY WHEN WE WHEN WE

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.621
CONDUCTED THE MIGRATION I ALSO

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:34.689

WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM --

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:59.080
THIS IS NOT A STARTING POINT FOR

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:00.748

SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES THAT WE

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:32.918

02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:40.392
GOING TO BE DUPLICATING THAT

02:16:40.458 --> 02:16:41.359
EFFORT BUT THAT WERE ENHANCING

02:16:41.426 --> 02:16:43.495
AT BRINGING IT TOGETHER.

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:45.430
AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WHERE

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:46.631
OUR EXPERTISE AT THE PLANT LAB

02:16:46.698 --> 02:16:48.199
IN PARTICULAR CAN CONTRIBUTE TO

02:16:48.266 --> 02:16:50.602
THAT AND PERHAPS ACCELERATE THAT

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:51.503
WORK THAT WERE IN A POSITION TO

02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:52.170
DO THAT.

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:53.572
BUT WE DO NOT INTEND TO

02:16:53.638 --> 02:16:57.309
DUPLICATE NONE OF US HAVE EXTRA

02:16:57.375 --> 02:16:59.277
RESOURCES TO WASTE.

02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:01.613
THAT IS TRUE THANK YOU.

02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:02.447
THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA TAKE

02:17:02.514 --> 02:17:04.950
PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE AND RIGHT

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:07.652
AFTER -- ISSUE FOURTEEN IS HEARD

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:10.388
TO AND SO WHEN WE LAUNCH RIGHT

02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:12.324
INTO ISSUE ELEVEN ISSUE ELEVEN

02:17:12.390 --> 02:17:14.159
WHICH IS OUR CITRUS PASSED AND

02:17:14.225 --> 02:17:15.226
DISEASE PREVENTION.

02:17:15.293 --> 02:17:16.361
I'M OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE

02:17:16.428 --> 02:17:17.996
NECESSARY FOR US TO BE

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:46.157
RATIFICATION ACTIVITIES.

02:17:46.224 --> 02:17:47.659
THE ONE LONG BEING AS WE'VE

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:49.394
HEARD SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I'VE

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:50.895
BEEN SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.

02:17:50.962 --> 02:17:53.164
IS THE MOST DEVASTATING OF ALL

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:55.433
STITCHES DISEASES IT HAS BEEN

02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:57.569
FOUND IN OTHER NATIONS HAS BEEN

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.570
FOUND IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA'S

02:17:58.637 --> 02:18:01.006
HAD DEVASTATING MPACTS WE'VE

02:18:01.072 --> 02:18:02.574
BEEN SUCCESSFUL THUS FAR IN

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:04.042
KEEPING THE DISEASE OUT OF OUR

02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:05.710
COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS AND THAT'S

02:18:05.777 --> 02:18:07.445
THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM. TO

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:08.380
GIVE US ENOUGH TIME FOR THE

02:18:08.446 --> 02:18:10.382
RESEARCH TO FIND THE REAL

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:11.916
SOLUTIONS TO THE DISEASE.

02:18:11.983 --> 02:18:15.720
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE --

02:18:15.787 --> 02:18:18.556
AND THE THE PROCESS REST OF OUR

02:18:18.623 --> 02:18:19.591
PROGRAM.

02:18:19.658 --> 02:18:21.126
THAT WE REALLY WILL BE BEST

02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:23.028
SERVED BY HAVING A DEDICATED

02:18:23.094 --> 02:18:24.529
CITRUS DIVISION.

02:18:24.596 --> 02:18:26.598
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HANDLE THE

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:28.133
FINES THAT WERE HAVING. TO BE

02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:29.934
ABLE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT

02:18:30.001 --> 02:18:31.936
ARE TRAINED EXCLUSIVELY AND

02:18:32.003 --> 02:18:33.371
CITRUS DISEASE RESPONSE.

02:18:33.438 --> 02:18:36.574
AND NOT MOVING PEOPLE FROM OTHER

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:39.110
EMERGENCY PROGRAMS TO FOCUS ON

02:18:39.177 --> 02:18:40.779
VAST WHICH MAKES US VULNERABLE

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.847
IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND TAKES RAMP

02:18:42.914 --> 02:18:44.616
UP TIME TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND

02:18:44.683 --> 02:18:47.619
INTO THE TRAINING -- THIS IS

02:18:47.686 --> 02:18:49.020
ALSO IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:50.655
CITRUS WELL IT'S NOT OUR LARGEST

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:52.323
PROP IT IS OVER THREE BILLION

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:53.358
DOLLARS.

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:54.759
AND AS A PART OF OUR HISTORY

02:18:54.826 --> 02:18:56.861
IT'S AN ICONIC GOODWILL

02:18:56.928 --> 02:18:58.363
AMBASSADOR TO THE WORLD ARE

02:18:58.430 --> 02:19:00.699
FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL AND TASTY.

02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:01.933
AS WELL AS NUTRITIOUS ADDRESS.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:03.334
SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL GOING

02:19:03.401 --> 02:19:05.770
FORWARD -- WE HAVE HAD IN THE

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:07.238
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SOME ONE

02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:10.041
TIME INVESTMENTS IN THIS PROGRAM

02:19:10.108 --> 02:19:11.543
WHICH OF REALLY HELPED US.

02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:14.546
ON REALLY -- IMPROVING OUR

02:19:14.612 --> 02:19:18.016
DIAGNOSTICS FOR RAPID DETECTION

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.451
AND THEN GOING OUT AND BEING

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:20.618
ABLE TO REPLICATE ONCE WE GET A

02:19:20.685 --> 02:19:23.421
TIME WE NOW HAVE ALMOST TWELVE

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:24.656
HUNDRED TREES THAT ARE POSITIVE.

02:19:24.723 --> 02:19:26.658
THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND IN A PRETTY

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:29.394
CONFINED AREA AND THE SOUTHERN

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:34.432
LA BASIN AREA -- AND AND WHAT WE

02:19:34.499 --> 02:19:35.033
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH

02:19:35.100 --> 02:19:36.301
THOSE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES IS

02:19:36.367 --> 02:19:37.969
DO THE PLANNING.

02:19:38.036 --> 02:19:40.205
AND HIRING OF STAFF TO BE ABLE

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:41.573
TO GO FORWARD ON THAT ONE TIME

02:19:41.639 --> 02:19:42.807
EXPENDITURES MAKE IT VERY

02:19:42.874 --> 02:19:44.042
CHALLENGING TO DO THE ADEQUATE

02:19:44.109 --> 02:19:45.076
KIND OF PLANNING.

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:46.411
THAT ALIGNS WITH OUR STRATEGIC

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:48.546
PLAN AND THE INVESTMENT IN

02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:49.180
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:51.249
THIS SO WE FEEL THAT WITH THIS

02:19:51.316 --> 02:19:53.351
REQUEST THIS YEAR WERE IN THE

02:19:53.418 --> 02:19:55.453
BEST POSITION WE HAVE BEEN. TO

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.755
BE ABLE TO HAVE A DEDICATED

02:19:56.821 --> 02:19:58.957
DIVISION DEVOTED TO THE CITRUS

02:19:59.023 --> 02:20:01.693
DISEASE PROGRAM.

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:04.496
IT'S GREAT -- TO IT IS -- I

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:06.631
THINK OF A PRESSING ISSUE AND

02:20:06.698 --> 02:20:06.798
I'M.

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.800
GLAD THAT WERE A REORGANIZING

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:11.469
AND CONTINUING TO PROVIDE TO OF

02:20:11.536 --> 02:20:13.138
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NECESSARY

02:20:13.204 --> 02:20:17.075
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:18.910
PLEASE RATES.

02:20:18.977 --> 02:20:21.012
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:20:21.079 --> 02:20:21.946
I'M SURE THE TROOPS ALL THE

02:20:22.013 --> 02:20:23.948
LETTER OF THE OPPOSING LETTER

02:20:24.015 --> 02:20:26.351
BUT NOT SO MUCH OPPOSING WHICH

02:20:26.417 --> 02:20:30.021
REQUESTING BUT EXPRESSING A REAL

02:20:30.088 --> 02:20:33.091
CONCERN ABOUT -- THE PESTICIDE

02:20:33.158 --> 02:20:38.129
SPECIFICALLY -- M..

02:20:38.196 --> 02:20:38.963
AND THE EFFECT ON OUR HONEY BEES.

02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:41.833
IN IN MY PARTICULAR REGION HONEY

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.135
BEES ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I'M

02:20:44.202 --> 02:20:47.071
SURE THERE ARE EVER WORLD -- ONE

02:20:47.138 --> 02:20:49.741
OF THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS -- THAT

02:20:49.808 --> 02:20:53.912
ARE BEING LOOKED AT AT THE

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:55.914
LOOKED AT SPECIFICALLY REGARDING

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:58.750
THE THE PESTICIDES SO THEY DON'T

02:20:58.817 --> 02:21:00.485
AFFECTED NOT -- NOT ONLY THAT

02:21:00.552 --> 02:21:02.921
THE LAND BUT ALSO THE PEOPLE

02:21:02.987 --> 02:21:04.422
PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:05.757
BENEFICIAL SAP THAT'S THAT'S A

02:21:05.824 --> 02:21:07.225
GREAT QUESTION I HAVE NOT SEEN

02:21:07.292 --> 02:21:08.159
THE LETTER BUT I HAVE HEARD

02:21:08.226 --> 02:21:08.927
ABOUT IT.

02:21:08.993 --> 02:21:09.961
AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:12.797
QUESTION TO BE ASKING BECAUSE

02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:15.099
ONE OF THAT THE PROCESS IS THAT

02:21:15.166 --> 02:21:16.434
WE GO THROUGH WHEN WE HAVE A

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:18.670
FIND OF AN INVASIVE PASSED.

02:21:18.736 --> 02:21:19.537
IS THAT WE WANT TO A RATHER IT

02:21:19.604 --> 02:21:21.005
IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO

02:21:21.072 --> 02:21:22.841
PREVENT EXTENSIVE PESTICIDE USE

02:21:22.907 --> 02:21:24.342
IF IT WERE TO BECOME INFESTED.

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:26.544
AND THEN HAVE TO BE A PART OF

02:21:26.611 --> 02:21:28.713
EVERY INDIVIDUAL FARMERS PEST

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:29.681
MANAGEMENT WITCHY.

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:31.282
SO OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND

02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:32.951
QUICKLY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:34.586
THERE ARE MANY STEPS WE TAKE AS

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:36.621
A RESULT OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

02:21:36.688 --> 02:21:38.923
IMPACT ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE TO

02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:40.859
COVER THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS.

02:21:40.925 --> 02:21:42.293
IT'S ALL ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST

02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:44.495
MANAGEMENT WE FIRST LOOK AT HOW

02:21:44.562 --> 02:21:47.966
DO WE NOT DOWN THE IMMEDIATE

02:21:48.032 --> 02:21:48.800
POPULATION.

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:49.834
WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES THAT

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:50.902
ARE AVAILABLE TO US CAN IT BE

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:51.870
MECHANICAL LIKE?

02:21:51.936 --> 02:21:53.338
UP PULLING OUT A TREE OR OR

02:21:53.404 --> 02:21:54.839
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:21:54.906 --> 02:21:56.207
WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT ARE

02:21:56.274 --> 02:21:58.610
AVAILABLE THAT ARE BIOLOGICAL AS

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:00.578
WELL AS CHEMICAL WHAT ARE THE

02:22:00.645 --> 02:22:03.081
SOFTEST TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:05.183
AND STILL GET A RESULT? TO KEEP

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.285
THE INFESTATION FROM SPREADING

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:09.153
TO LARGER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SO WE

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.823
GO THROUGH THOSE I PM PROCESSES.

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:13.157
EARLY IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

02:22:13.224 --> 02:22:14.692
GOING TO BE A PROLONGED

02:22:14.759 --> 02:22:16.694
INFESTATION AND THIS IS -- CURT

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:18.363
WITH OUR CITRUS DISEASE PROGRAM

02:22:18.429 --> 02:22:19.797
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DO ON

02:22:19.864 --> 02:22:22.634
RESEARCH IS TO START TO IDENTIFY

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:24.535
BIOLOGICALS WHAT ARE BENEFICIAL

02:22:24.602 --> 02:22:25.670
PASS.

02:22:25.737 --> 02:22:27.906
NORMALLY WE HAVE TO GO OUT TO

02:22:27.972 --> 02:22:30.041
AREAS OF ORIGIN I BELIEVE THIS

02:22:30.108 --> 02:22:32.577
PARTICULAR WHAT'S CAME FROM

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:33.144
PAKISTAN.

02:22:33.211 --> 02:22:34.646
SO IT TAKES TIME TO DEPLOY

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:36.180
PEOPLE TO GO TO WHERE THEY MIGHT

02:22:36.247 --> 02:22:38.416
BE ABLE TO FIND IT BENEFICIAL.

02:22:38.483 --> 02:22:40.385
THAT CAN BE BROUGHT IN MAKE SURE

02:22:40.451 --> 02:22:41.953
THAT GOES THROUGH THE STEPS TO

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:43.488
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T PROVIDE.

02:22:43.554 --> 02:22:45.456
ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

02:22:45.523 --> 02:22:47.258
THEN DO BREEDING CYCLES TO HAVE

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:50.128
ENOUGH TO RUN PILOT PROGRAMS.

02:22:50.194 --> 02:22:52.363
SO WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL EARLY

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:53.765
ON A LOT OF THIS WORK HAPPENED

02:22:53.831 --> 02:22:57.468
WITH PEOPLE FROM UC RIVERSIDE --

02:22:57.535 --> 02:22:59.404
THAT SPECIALIZE IN AND GOING TO

02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:00.672
THESE AREAS OF ORIGIN TO

02:23:00.738 --> 02:23:02.407
IDENTIFY WHAT'S GOING TO WORK WE

02:23:02.473 --> 02:23:04.242
HAVE A WASP IT'S CALLED TAMARIX

02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.909
SCEA.

02:23:04.976 --> 02:23:08.313
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEPLOY --

02:23:08.379 --> 02:23:10.114
EXTENSIVELY I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:23:10.181 --> 02:23:11.716
I'M CLEAR WE HAVE REARED AND

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.017
RELEASED OVER THREE MILLION OF

02:23:13.084 --> 02:23:15.820
THESE WASP AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:23:15.887 --> 02:23:17.055
AND OVER THE LIFETIME THAT WE'VE

02:23:17.121 --> 02:23:18.656
HAD THESE WHAT'S IN THE BREEDING

02:23:18.723 --> 02:23:20.124
CYCLES FOR DEPLOYMENT.

02:23:20.191 --> 02:23:21.859
WE'VE RELEASED OVER ELEVEN

02:23:21.926 --> 02:23:23.695
MILLION SINCE THE INCEPTION OF

02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:27.031
BEING ABLE TO DO THIS BIOLOGICAL

02:23:27.098 --> 02:23:27.699
CONTROL.

02:23:27.765 --> 02:23:29.434
WE ALSO CONSTANTLY COME BACK AND

02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:30.935
CHECK TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:32.670
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:35.406
AS WELL AS FOR US WE REALLY NEED

02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:36.607
TO CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE

02:23:36.674 --> 02:23:37.942
ESTABLISHED AND THAT THEY'RE

02:23:38.009 --> 02:23:40.378
DOING WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WHICH

02:23:40.445 --> 02:23:42.146
IS THIS BENEFICIAL LAST.

02:23:42.213 --> 02:23:44.782
TAKING CARE OF OF THE ASIAN SIT

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:45.717
JUST SELL IT.

02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:47.919
AND WE HAVE -- FOUND

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:49.020
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE TERRORISTS

02:23:49.087 --> 02:23:51.656
YET OVER EIGHTY LOCATIONS SO

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:52.991
THAT SHOWS IS THAT WE HAVE A

02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.993
BENEFICIAL THAT'S BECOMING

02:23:55.059 --> 02:23:56.294
ESTABLISHED TO BE ABLE TO COME

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:58.429
BACK THIS INVASIVE PASSED THE

02:23:58.496 --> 02:23:59.731
ASIAN CITRUS SELECT.

02:23:59.797 --> 02:24:01.632
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS I

02:24:01.699 --> 02:24:02.266
THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE

02:24:02.333 --> 02:24:06.004
WE'VE DONE THIS FOR OVER TWENTY

02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.571
FIVE YEARS FARM THAT FLIGHT

02:24:06.637 --> 02:24:06.838
PROGRAM.

02:24:06.904 --> 02:24:07.872
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO THIRTY

02:24:07.939 --> 02:24:09.974
YEARS AGO WE USE HELICOPTERS TO

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:11.409
FLY MALATHION?

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:12.877
HAPPY TO SAY WE'VE MOVED PAST

02:24:12.944 --> 02:24:15.346
THOSE DAYS WITH STERILE RELEASE

02:24:15.413 --> 02:24:17.648
OF MED FLIES SO THAT ON ANY

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.784
GIVEN WEEK WE'RE RELEASING OVER

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:20.718
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE

02:24:20.785 --> 02:24:24.389
MILLION STERILE MED FLIES -- TO

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:26.457
BREED IF THERE IS AN INFESTATION

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:27.992
THAT INFESTATION OUT OF THAT

02:24:28.059 --> 02:24:31.396
CYCLE THEY FLY OVER AT ABOUT.

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:32.196
TWO THOUSAND FEET SO WE'VE

02:24:32.263 --> 02:24:33.664
LEARNED FROM ALL OF OUR PROGRAM

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:35.166
SO THAT IF WE FIND THAT WE'RE

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:36.567
GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:38.803
INFESTATION WE CAN BEGIN THAT

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:40.605
KIND OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

02:24:40.671 --> 02:24:44.142
IMMEDIATELY.

02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:46.477
HAD TO COST YES.

02:24:46.544 --> 02:24:47.412
YES MA'AM.

02:24:47.478 --> 02:24:48.312
THAT'S A LOT OF STERILE MED

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:50.381
FLIES A LOT LOT OF LOS.

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:52.817
YEAH I AM.

02:24:52.884 --> 02:24:54.285
I HAVE AN ALLERGY TO US WITH A

02:24:54.352 --> 02:24:55.353
THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A NIGHTMARE

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:59.690
THERE HAD DISCUSSION -- BUT THE

02:24:59.757 --> 02:25:02.093
LEASING THIS -- WE SEEM THEY SEE

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:02.894
P. SHOW UP IN MY DISTRICT AND

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:04.262
SPREAD AND SO MY CONSTITUENTS

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:05.430
ARE DEFINITELY PAYING ATTENTION

02:25:05.496 --> 02:25:07.799
AND CONCERNED -- FOR THEIR OWN

02:25:07.865 --> 02:25:08.766
CONSUMPTION MUCH LESS WELL I

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:10.201
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT COULD

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:12.203
HAVE TO OUR BIGGER AGRICULTURAL.

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:13.704
COMMUNITY OUT THERE WE'VE SEEN

02:25:13.771 --> 02:25:15.173
TREES THAT ARE BEING UPROOTED AN

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:17.408
ANIMATIC HATED IN THE MOMENT BUT

02:25:17.475 --> 02:25:19.110
THE STATE HAS CONTINUED AND SO.

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:20.511
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

02:25:20.578 --> 02:25:22.513
PROTECTING HUMAN HEALTH ALONG

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.314
THE WAY BUT WERE YOU SIGNALED IS

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:26.317
POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:26.751
DON'T.

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:28.820
WE WE GET THIS UNDER CONTROL AS

02:25:28.886 --> 02:25:31.189
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO IT'S IT'S

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:33.157
STARTED IN ONE OF MY CITIES

02:25:33.224 --> 02:25:34.459
TONIGHT IN MULTIPLE OF MY CITIES

02:25:34.525 --> 02:25:35.560
UNTIL.

02:25:35.626 --> 02:25:36.994
NEIGHBORS ARE DEFINITELY A

02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:38.129
LITTLE FREAKED OUT ABOUT THEIR

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:38.796
TREES LEVY IN -- AND I KNOW THAT

02:25:38.863 --> 02:25:40.231
THAT'S A SMALLER PART OF THE

02:25:40.298 --> 02:25:41.265
WORRY THAT WE HAVE ON IN THIS

02:25:41.332 --> 02:25:43.167
ECOSYSTEM.

02:25:43.234 --> 02:25:45.269
AND SO ON I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:25:45.336 --> 02:25:46.504
THAT.

02:25:46.571 --> 02:25:48.172
WELL I PREFER THEN BIOLOGICALS

02:25:48.239 --> 02:25:49.040
THAT WERE YOU SEEN EVERYTHING

02:25:49.107 --> 02:25:50.842
AND ARE DISPOSABLE TO MAKE SURE

02:25:50.908 --> 02:25:51.609
THIS DOESN'T GET OUT OF CONTROL

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:53.444
AND WE THEN REALLY PUT AT REST

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:55.646
THE BIGGER AGRICULTURAL.

02:25:55.713 --> 02:25:57.448
MARKET THAT WE HAVE THAT'S AND

02:25:57.515 --> 02:25:58.216
PUT INTO ECONOMY HERE.

02:25:58.282 --> 02:26:00.852
AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE --

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:01.886
YOU KNOW RULE IN IRVINE

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:03.387
CALIFORNIA ARE SO INTER

02:26:03.454 --> 02:26:05.223
CONNECTED AND INTERDEPENDENT BUT

02:26:05.289 --> 02:26:07.458
MANY OF THESE INFESTATIONS DO

02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:09.227
OCCUR IN AN URBAN SETTING.

02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:11.596
AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:12.830
WE DO GOOD COMMUNICATION AND

02:26:12.897 --> 02:26:14.832
OUTREACH AND CONSULTATION IN

02:26:14.899 --> 02:26:16.601
TOWN HALL MEETINGS -- SO THAT

02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:18.436
ARE URBAN NEIGHBORS AND

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.505
CONSUMERS -- FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:26:20.571 --> 02:26:22.006
WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THAT

02:26:22.073 --> 02:26:23.941
THEIR CONCERNS HAVE BEEN LISTEN

02:26:24.008 --> 02:26:25.710
TO BECAUSE THAT THAT'S A TRUST

02:26:25.776 --> 02:26:27.311
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE TO

02:26:27.378 --> 02:26:29.147
MAINTAIN AND I'VE SPENT A YOU

02:26:29.213 --> 02:26:30.681
KNOW A DAY WALKING WITH THE

02:26:30.748 --> 02:26:32.116
FOLKS WHO DID HAVE TO REMOVE

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:34.152
TREES AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO

02:26:34.218 --> 02:26:34.752
SEE SOMEONE'S.

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:35.853
ORANGE TREE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:37.555
PLANTED BY THEIR GRANDFATHER OR

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:40.358
SOMETHING HAVE TO BE UPROOTED

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:41.325
THE SUCH AT CITRUS INDUSTRY'S

02:26:41.392 --> 02:26:42.660
BEEN VERY GENEROUS AND TRYING.

02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:43.761
TO DO REPLACEMENTS WHERE THAT'S

02:26:43.828 --> 02:26:47.131
POSSIBLE BUT I HAVE TO SAY IT IS.

02:26:47.198 --> 02:26:49.300
AMAZING HOW C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; OPERATIVE THE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:51.469
CITIZENS HAVE BEEN AND I CAN'T

02:26:51.536 --> 02:26:53.437
SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT THAT KIND

02:26:53.504 --> 02:26:55.506
OF COOPERATION THAT'S WHAT MAKES

02:26:55.573 --> 02:26:56.440
CALIFORNIA WORK THAT'S WHEN WE

02:26:56.507 --> 02:27:05.716
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN HELP EACH

02:27:05.783 --> 02:27:07.451
OTHER AND SERVE ONE ANOTHER.

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:08.052
THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS

LET'S -- TAKE A SECOND AND GO

02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:10.955
BACK -- TO ISSUE THIRTEEN MISERY

02:27:11.022 --> 02:27:11.789
THIS NEEDS TO LIVE AND IF WE CAN

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:15.893
GET A MOTION ON THE TABLE LARA.

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.795
BLOOM HI FONG GARCIA.

02:27:17.862 --> 02:27:19.430
MULLIN PATTERSON RIGHT YES

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:19.730
[inaudible]

OF THE THE TOPIC OF OF HONEY

02:27:31.509 --> 02:27:34.245
BEES AND COLONY COLLAPSE

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:36.447
DISORDER AND THE NEO NEXT GOOD.

02:27:36.514 --> 02:27:39.150
TAUGHT IN THE NEONICOTINOID --

02:27:39.217 --> 02:27:40.484
ISSUE THOSE ARE ALL KIND OF

02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:41.652
PERCOLATING OUT THERE AND

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.621
THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT IT'S

02:27:43.688 --> 02:27:47.225
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- CITRUS

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:50.461
TREES CAPTION -- A WITHOUT

02:27:50.528 --> 02:27:51.796
POLLINATION POLLINATION

02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:53.698
TYPICALLY IS COMING FROM FROM

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:56.133
BEES AND TO SO I I THINK THAT --

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:59.036
WE ALL SHARE AND IT A AND

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:00.838
INTEREST IN RESOLVING THE THIS

02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:05.843
KIND OF ISSUE AND IN A WAY THAT --

02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:07.378
TO WORKS FOR EVERYONE YES AND

02:28:07.445 --> 02:28:08.879
AND THAT THAT'S BEEN THE OUR

02:28:08.946 --> 02:28:11.082
CONSULTATION PROCESS WITH DPR AS

02:28:11.148 --> 02:28:13.184
WELL AS E. HA ON PUBLIC HEALTH

02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:15.319
AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

02:28:15.386 --> 02:28:16.187
WE ALSO DO A CONSULTATION WITH

02:28:16.254 --> 02:28:17.054
FIELD.

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.823
FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S --

02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:20.358
AND THE NEO NECKS ARE USED IN

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:23.294
ACCORDING WITH THE CRITERIA TO

02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:25.363
PREVENT IMPACTS TO BEES IN

02:28:25.429 --> 02:28:26.931
ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER.

02:28:26.998 --> 02:28:28.733
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE BUT I ALSO

02:28:28.799 --> 02:28:29.834
HAVE TO THINK THIS COMMITTEE THE

LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR BROWN

02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:33.337
LAST YEAR FOR THE INVESTMENT IS

02:28:33.404 --> 02:28:34.305
BEING MADE IN OUR BE SAFE

02:28:34.372 --> 02:28:35.539
PROGRAM.

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:37.541
SO THAT WE CAN GET BEE HIVES

02:28:37.608 --> 02:28:38.743
REGISTERED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:40.578
NOT BEING PLACED IN PLACES THAT

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:41.345
ARE NOT.

02:28:41.412 --> 02:28:44.248
NOT A COMPATIBLE WITH THE CROPS

02:28:44.315 --> 02:28:45.383
THAT MAYBE USING PESTICIDES SO

02:28:45.449 --> 02:28:47.051
WE'RE MAKING A CONSIDERABLE

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:49.320
INVESTMENT BECAUSE THESE ARE SO

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:50.321
IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:52.523
CALIFORNIA OUR ALMOND BLOOM EACH

02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:54.458
YEAR IS LITERALLY THE WORLD'S

02:28:54.525 --> 02:28:55.693
LARGEST.

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.495
POLLINATION PROJECT WHEN IT

02:28:57.561 --> 02:29:00.598
OCCURS -- SO BEES MATTER TO

02:29:00.665 --> 02:29:01.732
CALIFORNIA AND TO CALIFORNIA

02:29:01.799 --> 02:29:07.738
AGRICULTURE AS WELL AS BEING AN

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:08.105
IMPORTANT PART.

02:29:08.172 --> 02:29:09.507
OF JUST.

02:29:09.573 --> 02:29:10.908
MAKING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR

02:29:10.975 --> 02:29:11.842
ECOSYSTEMS HOLE.

02:29:11.909 --> 02:29:13.978
ALSO A DEMONSTRATION OF HOW

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:14.645
FRAGILE OUR ECOSYSTEMS COMMITTEE

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:15.880
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE

02:29:15.946 --> 02:29:17.615
ISSUES -- LA -- I THINK YOU'VE

02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:18.516
GOT SOME COMMENTS ON THIS YES

02:29:18.582 --> 02:29:19.617
THANK YOU SEAN MARTIN OF

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:20.284
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:21.452
SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

02:29:21.519 --> 02:29:23.020
APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST

02:29:23.087 --> 02:29:24.155
GIVING THIS.

02:29:24.221 --> 02:29:26.457
THAT THAT RECENT INCREASES IT.

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:28.559
AND THE SPREAD OF BOTH ASIAN

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:29.727
CITRUS WELLAND ANIMAL LONG ON

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:30.828
BEING IN THE GROWING NUMBERS OF

02:29:30.895 --> 02:29:31.929
TREES INFECTED WITH ONE LINE

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:38.669
BANG OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS --

02:29:38.736 --> 02:29:39.236
WE THINK THE REQUEST FOR THE

02:29:39.303 --> 02:29:39.837
ADDITIONAL STAFF AND RESOURCES

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:40.671
FOR THE DEDICATED DIVISION IS

02:29:40.738 --> 02:29:41.339
REASONABLE -- WE ALSO

02:29:41.405 --> 02:29:42.907
RECOMMENDED THAT YOU REQUIRE

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:44.975
CDFA TO REPORT ON THEIR CURRENT

02:29:45.042 --> 02:29:46.877
YEAR EXPENDITURES -- AS PART OF

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:48.646
OUR ANALYSIS WE NOTED THAT THEY

02:29:48.713 --> 02:29:49.914
WEREN'T PLANNING ON SPENDING

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:52.116
SOME OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE

02:29:52.183 --> 02:29:52.683
APPROPRIATED TO THEM IN THE

THAT GOES TOWARDS A HOLISTIC

02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:14.904
APPROACH THAT INCLUDES EDUCATION

THEIR GROVE CDFA IS FOCUSED ON

02:50:42.899 --> 02:50:49.105
THAT URBAN EDUCATION TREATMENT.

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:50.540
