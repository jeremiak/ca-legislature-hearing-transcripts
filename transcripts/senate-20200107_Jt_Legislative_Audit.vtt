SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.701
THIRTEEN YEARS AND WE THINK

DOLLARS I AND IT'S GROWING

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:16.829
BECAUSE OF- THE LACK OF

00:13:16.896 --> 00:13:17.630

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.732

ACTUALLY GETTING TO SEE A CURE

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.671
ME AND SO THE IMPACT IS FISCAL

00:13:25.738 --> 00:13:27.573
NOT JUST TO THE STATE BUT TO A

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.308
LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:32.144
IF WE TALK ABOUT- THE LACK OF

MONEY IN SCHOOL IN SCHOOLS THIS

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:35.748
TAKES A BIG CHUNK OUT OF

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:36.782

SPECIALTIES WHERE THERE HAVE

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.110
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

GETTING MORE QUEUE UP IN THE

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:24.129

WITH OUR CONCLUSION THAT

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:18.076
GROUP OF Q. AMIS WHO HAVE X.

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:19.344
NUMBER OF OFFICES IN

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.179
CALIFORNIA. WE DID ADDITIONAL

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:22.914
ANALYSIS AND WE REALLY WERE

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:25.517
ABLE TO DISPUTE THAT- WE HAD

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:27.252
OUR I. T. FOLKS REALLY LOOK TO

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:29.921
SEE HOW MANY Q. ARMIES WITHIN

00:21:29.988 --> 00:21:31.156
CERTAIN ZIP CODES WITH THAT'S

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:33.759
HOW THEY IDENTIFY CUMAE. AND WE

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.027
WERE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY TO PUT

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:38.163
IT IN AND- SUCCINCT TERMS

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.099
DISPUTE THAT THAT ASSERTION

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:44.569
THAT THERE IS NOT A SHORTAGE

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:45.837
THERE ABSOLUTELY IS A SHORTAGE

00:21:45.904 --> 00:21:46.905
NOT TO MEET IS THE CLUE ENDING

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:50.642
NUMBER REQUIRE IS INCREASING.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.243
NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT CALLS AS

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:53.011
YOU'LL SEE IN THE GRASS.

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:53.779
QUANDARY THEN IF YOU'RE WHAT

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:54.379
I'LL SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:54.880
PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:55.747
ADDRESSED CALIFORNIA. WE HAD

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:58.250
SOME- REASONS THAT WE DISCUSS

00:21:58.316 --> 00:22:00.318
IN THE REPORT. WE THINK THE

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:02.054
MEDICAL FOR LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.922
ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:06.091
IT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:07.359
TWO THOUSAND AND SIX- THE

00:22:07.426 --> 00:22:08.527
DIVISION HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:10.696
TO TRY TO DO THAT BUT- MEDICAL

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:12.798
COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER 30%

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:14.199
SINCE THAT TIME FRAME YET

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:15.667
YOU'RE NOT SEEING AN INCREASE

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:17.069
IN THAT MEDICAL LEGAL FEE

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:18.603
SCHEDULE. WE DID AN ANALYSIS

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.640
ARE. JUST USING- INFLATION

00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:25.243
CURRENTLY. THE FEES ARE. ARE

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.877
SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:27.979
FOR A BASIC EVALUATION JUST

00:22:28.046 --> 00:22:29.081
BASED ON INFLATION THAT WOULD

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:31.616
BE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS-

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:34.019
IF THEY HAD JUST INCREASED IT.

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:36.021
THAT WAY WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:38.457
NEEDS TO BE PROCESS FOR

00:22:38.523 --> 00:22:39.624
CREATING TO AYE MEANS THAT THE

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:40.392
DIVISION NEEDS TO BE MORE

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:42.894
PROACTIVE. IN DOING THE

00:22:42.961 --> 00:22:44.029
ANALOGIES USING THE STUDIES

00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:45.731
HAVE THAT IDENTIFY. OUR SEARCH

00:22:45.797 --> 00:22:47.432
SPECIALTIES WERE THERE ARE

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:51.002
SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES AND TRY

00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:51.570
TO WORK WITH MEDICAL GROUPS

00:22:51.636 --> 00:22:54.206
WORK. UP INDIVIDUALS KNOWS

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:55.073
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY IS TO TRY

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.675
TO GET MORE VISIT IS TO BE

00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.776
WILLING AND SPECIALIST TO BE

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.344
ARE WILLING TO BE Q. ARMIES- SO

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:00.779
THEY REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE

00:23:00.846 --> 00:23:02.314
THEIR DATA SO THAT'S- THAT'S

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.615
áREA NUMBER ONE AND WE'LL GO

00:23:03.682 --> 00:23:04.382
THROUGH THE GRAPHICS. AREA

00:23:04.449 --> 00:23:06.184
NUMBER TWO VERY QUICKLY-

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.652
DISCIPLINING THE PRACTICES FOR

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.321
DISCIPLINING THEY ACTUALLY HAVE

00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:11.223
TWO SEPARATE TRACKS FOR.

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:13.391
DISAPPOINTING ACUMEN ME IF

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:14.793
THERE ARE. INACCURATE

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.928
INCOMPLETE- POOR QUALITY

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:19.064
REPORTS- AND THEN THERE'S A

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:21.066
SEPARATE TRACK FOR Q. ME TO GET

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.368
REAPPOINTED. THE CONCERN WE SAW

00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:25.637
AND WE LAY OUT IN THE AUDIT

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:27.739
REPORT IS IF THERE ARE

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.074
COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THE

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:29.775
QUEUE A MEET WHAT WE WERE

00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:33.044
SEEKING IS THAT RATHER THAN.

00:23:33.111 --> 00:23:33.545
TAKING THAT THROUGH THE

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:34.780
DISCIPLINARY TRACK THING THAT

00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:35.881
CUBA ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:39.317
PROVIDE TENDS TO DISPUTE. OF

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:40.318
THE COMPLAINTS ARE THE

00:23:40.385 --> 00:23:42.087
ALLEGATIONS. THE ALLEGED

00:23:42.154 --> 00:23:44.089
VIOLENCE. I DID CHEN IS WAITING

00:23:44.156 --> 00:23:48.160
A BILL THAT INDIVIDUAL IS UP

00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:49.227
FOR RE APPOINT. AND BASICALLY

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:50.962
DIDN'T THE REAPPOINTMENT ON THE

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:52.664
ALLIGATOR. SO WE WERE REYES CAN

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:53.832
IN THE RIVER THAT THERE MAY BE.

00:23:53.899 --> 00:23:59.037
A DUE PROCESS. IT HERE AND WE

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:01.573
HAD EXAMPLE THE REPORT. PLEASE

THE QUEUE ARMY IS ABLE TO

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:04.643
RESPOND TO THAT. DIVISION OF

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:05.277
WORKERS COMPENSATION LOOKS AT

00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:06.478
IT DOESN'T. DENY THAT

00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:08.413
REAPPOINTMENT PERSON ISN'T UP

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.215
FOR REAPPOINTMENT UNTIL JUNE OF

THOSE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME IN

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.621
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN- SO

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:17.422
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:20.392
INDIVIDUAL. ARE WAS SUBJECT TO

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.227

SERVING AS A CUE I ME SO LOSING

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.702
INCOME NOT FOR THIS I OF CUBA

00:24:30.769 --> 00:24:31.736
MEANS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE

00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:35.407
FOR INJURED WORKERS TO SEE- AND

00:24:35.473 --> 00:24:36.942
REALLY IS PUT IN A POSITION

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:40.812
WHERE. THEIR AN INCENTIVE

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.447
THAT'S CREATED FOR THAT SECURE

00:24:42.514 --> 00:24:45.951
ME TO TRY TO SETTLE THE CASE SO

00:24:46.017 --> 00:24:48.119
HERE SHE CAN GET REAP AND CAN.

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:49.521
SERVICE SO WE REALLY HAVE SOME

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:50.155
CONCERN WITH HOW THE DIVISION

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.022
CARRYING OUT DISCIPLINE WHERE

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:53.124
THEY DO HAVE A SPECIFIC TRACK

00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:53.792
THEY COULD BE FOLLOWING BUT

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:56.695
THEY ARE USING. THE ABILITY TO

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:59.364
DENY A REAPPOINTMENT. AS

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:01.299
ESSENTIALLY DISCIPLINE AGAINST

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.567
SOME OF THESE COMMITTEES AND

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:04.870
THEN THE THIRD ISSUE. IS THE

00:25:04.936 --> 00:25:06.571
HIGH QUALITY REPORTS THERE IS

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:08.139
STATUTORY REQUIREMENT STATE LAW

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:10.342
THAT REQUIRES THE DIVISION. TO

00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:12.210
EVALUATE A SAMPLE NOW AND

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:14.212
CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING AT A

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:16.748
SAMPLE OF REPORTS TO MAKE SURE

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:17.616
THAT Q. ARMIES ARE DOING A GOOD

00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:20.652
JOB OF. OF PROVIDING THE

00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:21.253
APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EVIDENCE

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.688
NECESSARY. TO MAKE. THE PROPER

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:25.223
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO A

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.125
DISABILITY WITH. RESPECT TO THE

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:31.730
pWORKER WOULD BE ENTITLED TO BUT

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:32.864
WE WERE NOT SEEING WE HAVE NOT

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:36.501
SEEN- EVIDENCE OF CONTINUOUS

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:38.370
REVIEW OF THESE MEDICAL REPORTS

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:40.105
PROVIDED BY Q. ARMIES. SAID

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.707
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:44.142
WAS ONE ATTACK IN TWO THOUSAND

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.210
AND FIFTEEN. WHERE THEY STARTED

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:46.511
LOOKING AT SOME REPORTS THEY

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:47.946
PULLED A SAMPLE OF A HUNDRED

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:51.483
REPORTS. UP LOOKED AT ABOUT

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:53.385
SIXTEEN OF THOSE REPORTS AND

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:58.723
85% OF THOSE. REPORTS HAD

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:03.261
PROBLEMS ACCORDING INDIVIDUAL

00:26:03.328 --> 00:26:08.033
AT VISION WHO WAS REVIEWING.

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:08.633
FOR SOME THEN THEY SAY YES TO

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.336
SEARCH FOR SAY. DID ANY OF ANY

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:11.970
OF THE OTHER REPORTS THEY

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:12.904
HAVEN'T DONE ANY DO. REVIEWS OF

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:13.705
REPORTS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THEY

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:14.306
DIDN'T FOLLOW UP ON ANY OF THE

00:26:14.372 --> 00:26:15.907
ISSUES THEY IDENTIFIED IN THOSE

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:16.441
6985% OF THOSE SIXTY NINE

00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:18.343
REPORTS SO ABOUT FIFTY REPORTS-

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:18.877
SO WE REALLY HAVE CONCERNS

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:20.979
ABOUT. OF THE DAY MISSIONS

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:23.281
EFFORTS AND THERE IS STATE LAW

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:25.283
THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO THESE

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.619
EVALUATIONS- AND ALSO TO COME

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:28.920
UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:30.388
IMPROVING THE PROGRAM. DO THE

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.223
Q. ARMIES NEED SOME TRAINING DO

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.892
THEY UNDERSTAND THE TYPE OF

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:35.860
REPORTING THAT THE TYPES OF

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:36.428
THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:38.163
INCLUDING IN THEIR REPORTS. SO

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:39.798
THAT THIRD ISSUE RELATED TO

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:41.800
THAT THE QUALITY OF THE REPORTS

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.301
IS THE FINAL ISSUE THAT WE

00:26:43.368 --> 00:26:44.469
DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:45.370
ALTERNATE OVER TO MICHELLE

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.106
SHE'LL STEP YOU THROUGH. THE

GRAPHICS IN THE REPORT THAT

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:52.344
WILL ILLUSTRATE- EACH OF THE

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.612
EACH OF THESE THREE ISSUES THAT

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:57.549

OF BEEN DESCRIBED A LITTLE BIT

00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:11.429
AT A HIGH LEVEL ALREADY BUT ALL

00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:13.098
KIND OF GIVE ANOTHER OVERVIEW

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.566
OF THE QUEUE MEANS HOW THE

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.401
PROCESS WORKS JUST. FOR CONTEXT

00:27:16.468 --> 00:27:18.269
AS WE GET INTO THE PACKET. Q.

00:27:18.336 --> 00:27:19.604
MEANS OUR PHYSICIANS. ARE

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:20.705
INVOLVED IN THE WORKERS

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.374
COMPENSATION PROCESS WHEN

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.208
THERE'S A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE

00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:24.509
INJURED WORKER AND THE

EMPLOYER. AND AS YOU SAID

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.645
EARLIER THAT. THAT COULD BE

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:29.147
ABOUT WHETHER THE INJURY

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:30.915
HAPPENED AT WORK. OF THE EXTENT

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:33.184
OF THE INJURY. AND SO WHEN

00:27:33.251 --> 00:27:34.652
THERE IS A DISPUTE TO THE

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.388

THREE Q. AMIS. THERE IS A

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:42.994
LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:44.963
BETWEEN REPRESENTED WORKERS IN

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.231

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:48.066
COVER THAT. IN ANOTHER SLIDE.

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.368
BUT ESSENTIALLY THEY SELECT ONE

00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:50.969
OF THE Q. AMIS TO PERFORM THE

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:54.372
EVALUATION. AND ESSENTIALLY

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:58.643
THEY'LL PRODUCE A REPORT THAT.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.545
THAT JUDGES ARE OTHER PARTIES

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.414
WILL USE TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.815
NOW WITH THE QUEUE IN ME IS NOT

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:05.450
AVAILABLE WITHIN THE FIRST

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:06.584
SIXTY DAYS AS THE STATE AUDITOR

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.853
INDICATED- VERY THEY CAN

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.855
REQUEST A REPLACEMENT PANEL AND

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:12.657
ESSENTIALLY THE PROCESS STARTS

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:13.625
ALL OVER AGAIN AND THEY'LL END

00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:15.560
UP SELECTING A QUEUE IN ME SO

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:17.896
Q. MEANS ARE LIKE WITH SAID

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:19.297
EARLIER VERY IMPORTANT PART OF

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.999
THE PROCESS IN RESOLVING THE

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.667
DISPUTE SO THAT THESE UNDER

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:25.270
WORKER'S CAM- BENEFITS. SO IF

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:28.206
YOU TURN TO THE SECOND PAGE OF

00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:30.208
THE HANDOUT WILL START WITH THE

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:31.576
FIRST ISSUE WHICH WAS THERE'S A

00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:34.879
SHORTAGE OF A Q. AMIS AND HERE

00:28:34.946 --> 00:28:37.315
REALLY SHOWING THAT THERE ARE

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.250
NOT ENOUGH CUTE MEANS TO ME TO

00:28:39.317 --> 00:28:41.419
ME AND WHEN THE TOP LINE BRAFF

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:44.456
SEE THE NUMBER THOSE REQUESTS

00:28:44.522 --> 00:28:45.690
FOR ME SERVICES IT'S INCREASED

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.659
30% OVER THIS FIVE YEAR PERIOD

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:50.495
OF TIME. AT THE SAME TIME IS

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.596
THAT THE DEMAND IS INCREASING

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:55.667
SUPPORT INCREASING 12% AT IS

00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:59.204
THIS- MENTION WE DIDN'T SEE

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.107
THAT CERTAIN SPECIALTY OR WORSE.

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:04.309
THAT AND THE OVERALL SITUATION.

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:07.045
AND SO. AGAIN THIS IS REALLY AN

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:08.246
INDICATOR THAT THERE ARE NOT

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:08.880
ENOUGH Q. MEANS ON THE SYSTEM

00:29:08.947 --> 00:29:09.547
AND IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH Q.

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:11.883
MEANS I CAN IMPACT THE INJURED

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:12.383
WORKER IN GETTING THEIR

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.153
BENEFITS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.087
YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE

00:29:16.154 --> 00:29:18.590
THREE. THIS IS STILL

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:20.592
ILLUSTRATING THAT FIRST ISSUE

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.060
THAT WE SAW THAT Q. MEANS A

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:23.027
BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.763
UNAVAILABLE. SO LIKE I SAID

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.499
EARLIER WHEN THERE'S A QUEUE ME

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:28.533
IS NOT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.101
FIRST SIXTY DAYS THEY CAN

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:32.403
REQUEST A REPLACEMENT PANEL SO

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.838
THAT'S THIS YELLOW BAR HERE.

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:34.706
AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IT'S

00:29:34.772 --> 00:29:36.441
QUADRUPLED ITS STATE WATER

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:37.642
MENTION IT'S QUADRUPLED OVER

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.911
THIS FIVE FIVE YEAR PERIOD

00:29:39.978 --> 00:29:41.913
WHICH REALLY MEANS THERE ARE

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.048
NOT ENOUGH Q. NEEDS TO MEET THE

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:45.817
DEMAND AND THAT HAS AN IMPACT

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:48.820
ON THE INJURED WORKER. SO IN

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.389
THE CASE WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE

00:29:51.456 --> 00:29:51.990
INTERPRETERS IN THE CASE OF AN

00:29:52.056 --> 00:29:54.726
AVAIL. Q. MEANS. THE CASE. IT

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:56.928
BY MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AND SO

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.897
AGAIN THAT'S IMPACTING INTO A

00:29:58.963 --> 00:30:00.198
WORKER IN GETTING THEIR

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:03.067
BENEFITS. BUT ALSO- WHEN WE

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:04.435
TALK TO AN APPLICANT ATTORNEYS

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:05.803
ASSOCIATION THE PRESIDENT

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.705
INDICATED THAT. SOME INJURED

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.440
WORKERS MAY ACTUALLY DELAY

00:30:09.507 --> 00:30:10.475
GETTING TREATMENT UNTIL THEY

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:11.709
KNOW WHAT THEIR BENEFITS ARE

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:13.444
GOING TO BE. SO THIS DELAYED

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:18.116
CAN IMPACT THAT AS WELL. THE

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.417
THING IS THE STATE AUDITOR ALSO

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:21.586
MENTIONED THIS ALSO INCREASES

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:22.987
COSTS FOR THE EMPLOYERS IT'S

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:25.223
NOT JUST THE INJURED WORKERS

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:25.690
ARE IMPACTED SAID. THE

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:29.460
EMPLOYERS AS WELL. AND THAT'S A

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:31.496
STATE WATER MENTIONS DUE TO BE

00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:32.564
SEE IS NOT NECESSARILY

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.066
ACKNOWLEDGE A SHORTAGE AND HAS

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:38.303
NOT TAKEN ACTION IN THOSE THREE

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:38.870
AREAS. THE UPDATING THE FEE

00:30:38.937 --> 00:30:42.440
SCHEDULE. A RECRUITING. AND

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:44.542
USING THEIR DATA SPECIFICALLY

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:46.878
TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS OF SAY

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:48.746
THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT ARE

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:49.747
GOING TO HAVE THE SHORTAGES.

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:55.787
ANDS. THE SPECIALTIES SO OUR

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.556
RECOMMENDATION TO D. W. C. IS

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:03.127
pTHAT PLAN FOR HOW IT'S GONNA

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.862
RECRUIT WHAT SPECIALTIES IT'S

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:06.664
GOING TO WHAT HAVE THE GREATEST

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:08.166
SHORTAGES AND FOCUSING ON THAT

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:09.968
AREA. YOU CANNOT WE ALSO

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:12.036
RECOMMENDED THAT USE DATA TO

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.338
KIND OF FOCUS ITS EFFORTS AND

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:15.073
IT CAN USE THAT DATA TO

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.041
IDENTIFY WHERE THE GEOGRAPHICAL

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.977
SHORTAGES MAKE SURE THE THIRD

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.745
ADDRESSING YOU'LL TARGETED

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:23.147
TARGETED APPROACH. SO WE ALSO

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:23.715
HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:26.451
THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:29.320
RECOMMENDATION IS TO REQUIRED

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.855
GDC TO REVIEW AND UPDATE THE

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:34.058
FEE SCHEDULE AND WE PUT IN

00:31:34.125 --> 00:31:35.393
THERE TO AT LEAST EVERY TWO

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.461
YEARS BASED ON INFLATION I

00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:38.563
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE. A

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.164
TRANSLATION PENDING EXACTLY. SO

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:42.900
OUR SECOND RECOMMEND. IS TO

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:43.534
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF Q. MEANS

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:46.537
ON THE PANEL. ENDS THAT'S

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.172
REALLY TO REDUCE THOSE DELAYS

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:48.940
THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THESE

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:52.610
REPLACEMENT PANELS AND I'M

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:53.211
ACTUALLY GONNA EXPLAIN THAT TO

00:31:53.278 --> 00:31:53.811
YOU IN MORE DETAIL ON THE NEXT

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:57.782
SLIDE. IF YOU. SO THE TOP OF

00:31:57.849 --> 00:31:59.851
THIS PAGE IS SHOWING WHAT THE

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:02.987
PROCESSES RIGHT NOW AND THE

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:03.655
BOTTOM HALF IS WHAT OUR

00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:04.922
RECOMMENDATION ACTUALLY LOOK

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:07.091
LIKE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:09.260
PAGE D. W. C. GENERATES THAT

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:12.363
PANEL OF THREE KILOMETERS. AS I

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.598
SAID EARLIER THE REPRESENTED IN

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.566
ON REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE

00:32:15.633 --> 00:32:16.000
ON THE LEFT SIDE THE

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:20.171
UNREPRESENTED WORKER THERE'S

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:20.738
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:21.372
CHOOSE FROM ANY OF THE THREE ON

00:32:21.439 --> 00:32:21.939
THE- ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE

00:32:22.006 --> 00:32:24.442
REPRESENTED WORK. WHAT OUT OF

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.010
THE THREE THE INJURED WORKER

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:29.047
ELIMINATES ONE THE EMPLOYER

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:29.614
ELIMINATES ONE AND THEN THEY

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.383
HAVE ONE TO CHOOSE FROM. NOW

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.052
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA WE SAW

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:36.888
THAT REPRESENT A WORKERS IT WAS

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:37.889
THREE TIMES HIGHER THE NUMBER

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:39.424
OF REPLACEMENT PANELS AND THAT

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:40.224
MEANS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING MORE

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.327
DELAYS ON THAT SIDE. SO OUR

00:32:42.393 --> 00:32:44.228
RECOMMENDATION IS TO INCREASE

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.630
THIS PANEL SIZE FOR THE

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:48.366
REPRESENTED SIZE SIDE TO FIVE.

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:49.967
TO HAVING FIVE SOL EXPLAIN WHAT

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.337
THAT LOOKS LIKE ON THE BOTTOM

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:52.937
HALF THE PAGE WE NEED MORE Q.

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:56.040
ARMIES FOR THAT. YES AND THAT'S

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.809
SOMETHING THAT THAT HE TO BE

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:58.943
SEE SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN IT'S

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.412
USING IT'S DATA. TO FIGURE OUT

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:03.514
WELL HOW HOW MUCH HOW MANY Q.

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.883
MEANS DO THEY NEED. TO SO

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.785
OTHER. THE PAGES ARE PROPOSAL

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:09.253
SO THE UNREPRESENTED WORKERS

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.822
SIDE ON THE LEFT IT WOULD STAY

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:11.989
THE SAME THEY WOULD STILL HAVE

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:13.691
THOSE THREE TO CHOOSE FROM. ON

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.326
THE RIGHT SIDE THE REPRESENTED

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.962
SIDE. OUT OF THE FIVE IT WOULD

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.263
STILL BE THE INJURED WORKER

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.032
WOULD ELIMINATE ONE. THE

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:22.367
EMPLOYER WOULD ELIMINATE ONE

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.202
AND THEN YOU'D HAVE THREE TO

00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:27.004
CHOOSE FROM. SO THAT'S REALLY

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:28.840
TO HELP REDUCE THIS PROBLEM

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:32.276
WITH THE- A REPLACEMENT PANELS

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:32.877
AND BETTER ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:37.215
AVAILABLE. AND AGAIN THIS IS

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:38.516
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:42.120
BECAUSE THE INJURED WORKER

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:42.720
HAVING THEIR BENEFITS DELAYED

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:46.624
GREATLY IMPACTS ON. SO THAT'S

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:47.191
THE FIRST ISSUE THROUGH THE

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:48.693
SLIDES OF YOU TURN TO THE- NEXT

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.363
PAGE FIVE. A DELIVERY SEE AN

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.898
APPROPRIATELY DISCIPLINE Q.

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:55.433
MEANS AND AS THE STATE AUDITOR

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.301
INDICATED THERE'S THESE TWO

00:33:57.368 --> 00:33:59.437
TRACKS THAT ARE LAID OUT AND

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:01.239
REGULATIONS THE LET SIDES THE

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:04.575
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND THE

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:05.777
RIGHT SIDES A RE APPOINTMENT

00:34:05.843 --> 00:34:08.379
PROCESS AND WE FOUND THAT D. W.

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.615
C. INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING ITS

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.517
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ALL THE

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:14.852
WAY THROUGH. BEFORE IT GOT TO

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:15.920
THE POINT WHERE THERE WOULD BE

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.321
A HEARING TAX DETERMINED THAT

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:19.056
AN ALLEGATION WAS IN FACT

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:21.559
VIOLATION THEY DENIED

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.194
REAPPOINTMENT IN SOME CASES

00:34:23.261 --> 00:34:24.862
THAT WE LOOKED AT BASED ON

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.864
THOSE ALLEGATIONS SO THEY

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.800
ACTUALLY USED THE REAPPOINTMENT

00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:32.703
PROCESS DISCIPLINE I'M I'M I

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.439
INTERRUPTED SO SICK CAN YOU SAY

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:37.341
THAT AGAIN SO. THE PRIOR TO THE

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:38.976
DISK AND WHAT WOULD DIE AFTER

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:39.844
THE HEARING SO THE HEARING WAS

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.846
IT HAPPENING EXACTLY OKAY THE

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:44.081
HEARING WAS NOT HAPPENING AT

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:46.484
BUT THEY WERE DENIED THE

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:49.086
APPLICATIONS BASED ON JUST THE

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:49.654
ALLEGATIONS THAT'S CORRECT.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.757
THANK YOU. RIGHT SO. THE

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:53.991
PROBLEM WITH THIS IS ONCE THE

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:54.826
CURE ME IS DENIED AS A STAY

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:55.893
HONOR POINTED OUT EARLIER. THEY

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.094
ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE QUEUE

00:34:57.161 --> 00:34:58.930
ME SUPPLY. MAKES THAT SHORTAGE

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:01.065
WORSE. THEY CANNOT EARN RELATED

00:35:01.132 --> 00:35:03.100
INCOME WHICH MEANS THAT THEY

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:05.603
MAY BE INCENTIVIZE TO SETTLE.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.537
SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:09.073
TURNING THEIR INCOME AND THEN

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:09.640
THAT THEY MAY BE DENIED DUE

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:14.779
PROCESS. AND SO ARE WE O HAVE

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:15.980
A RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.682
THIS SUBMIT HELP ENSURE THAT

00:35:17.748 --> 00:35:20.051
THE THESE TWO PROCESSES STATE

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:21.719
SEPARATE AND SO WE- OUR

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.155
RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE WC. TO

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:25.323
HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:27.391
THAT LAY OUT THESE TWO AS

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:30.661
SEPARATE PROCESSES. AND AGAIN

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:31.195
THAT WAY TO THE WHOLE DUE

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:34.398
PROCESS ARGUMENT. WHAT'S THE

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.767
DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT YES.

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.503
EXACTLY TO HELP ADDRESS THE DUE

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:40.771
PROCESS HELP MAKE SURE THAT

00:35:40.838 --> 00:35:42.907
THOSE CUNY'S STAY IN THE SUPPLY

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:46.043
UNTIL THEY ARE IN FACT YOU KNOW

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.577
HAVE A VIOLATION AND THERE

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:49.146
NEEDS TO BE DISCIPLINED. SO IF

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.782
YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:54.185
SIX WILL TALK ABOUT THE THIRD

00:35:54.252 --> 00:35:54.785
AND FINAL ISSUE THAT THE STATE

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:57.922
AUDITOR COVERED. SO. TWC IS NOT

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.725
REVIEWING A TO ME REPORTS FOR

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:05.463
QUALITY. AND SO THESE ARE THE

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.298
REPORTS THAT AFTER VALUATION

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.467
THE QUEUE ME RIGHT TO REPORT

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:10.001
AND THE JUDGE IS OR OTHER

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:10.568
PARTIES USE THAT TO RESOLVE

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:12.970
THAT DISPUTE. SO IT'S REALLY

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.605
IMPORTANT THAT THOSE REPORTS

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.140
ARE HIGH QUALITY HAVE THE

00:36:16.207 --> 00:36:17.508
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO

00:36:17.575 --> 00:36:20.811
MAKE THAT DECISION. SO D. W. C.

00:36:20.878 --> 00:36:21.445
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN

00:36:21.512 --> 00:36:23.915
STATE LAW OF. THAT THE REQUIRED

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:26.350
TO DO WERE IN RELATION TO.

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:27.652
REVIEWING FOR QUALITY IT'S RICK

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.887
REVIEWING A RANDOM SELECTION

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.122
AND ALSO HAVING AN ANNUAL

00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:33.157
REPORT PROVIDED TO THEIR

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.258
ADMINISTRATIVE TO DIRECTOR

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:37.628
ABOUT THAT REVIEW THE RESULTS

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:38.129
OF THAT REVIEW ENDS THE

00:36:38.195 --> 00:36:40.498
RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE. AND

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:41.632
WE SAW THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:43.568
NOT DOING THAT EXCEPT FOR THE

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:45.436
ONE CASES THE STATE AUDITOR

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:47.972
MENTIONED. SO THEN. WHEN IT

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:50.741
COMES TO WHAT THE JUDGES ARE

00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:53.377
DOING IF IT IF A JUDGE GETS THE

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:55.546
REPORT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE WHEN

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:56.881
IT NEEDS TO HAVE IN IT THE

00:36:56.948 --> 00:36:58.916
JUDGE MIGHT THROW IT OUT. OR

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.051
THEY MAY ASK FOR SUPPLEMENTAL

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:01.819
INFORMATION WHICH MEANS MORE

00:37:01.886 --> 00:37:04.188
DELAYS FOR THE INJURED WORKER

00:37:04.255 --> 00:37:05.523
SO THEY MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:06.357
THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OR THEY

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:08.192
MAY HAVE TO ENTER THE QUEUE IN

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:10.361
THE PROCESS. ALL OVER AGAIN. SO

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:13.831
WHEN WE TALK TO- CHIEF JUDGE

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.566
SHE PULLED HER JUDGES AND- THEY

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:17.401
INDICATED THAT. THEY REJECTED

00:37:17.468 --> 00:37:19.870
ABOUT SEVENTY REPORTS IN IN THE

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:22.573
LAST YEAR. BASED ON THEM THE

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.507
REPORTS I HAVE AN INFORMATION

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:24.809
THEY NEEDED TO HAVE IN THEM.

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:27.044
SERVERS TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE.

00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:28.646
AND SINCE D. W. C. DOES NOT

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:30.548
TRACK THAT THEY CAN ONLY

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:31.082
PROVIDE US WITH ONE OF THE

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:33.918
REJECTED REPORTS. SO BUT

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:35.186
TALKING TO THE JUDGE FOUND A

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:37.254
LOT MORE EXACTLY THIS GOES TO

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.657
THE QUALITY OF THE REPORTS. SO

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:41.492
ARE RECOMMENDED WE HAVE I'M

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:42.259
SORRY I DID NOT A QUESTION TO

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:45.196
GET FIT SO SOUL WHY WEREN'T THE

00:37:45.262 --> 00:37:48.866
TRACKING THE REPORTS IT IS. IT

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:50.067
WILL BRING HIM UP THERE THE

00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:51.869
NEXT PANEL. RIGHT SOLD SO THEY

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:55.239
HAD NO DATA. EXACTLY THE SAME

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.707
THE COULD LEAD SOME I GUESS THE

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.075
QUESTION IS OUT OF THOSE

00:37:58.142 --> 00:37:59.844
REPORTS THAT THE JUDGES CHAU DO

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.445
THEY ONLY HAD ONE OF THE REJECT

00:38:01.512 --> 00:38:03.214
THE REPORT THEY CAN ONLY

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.515
PROVIDE US WITH ONE REJECTED

00:38:04.582 --> 00:38:07.218
REPORT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS

00:38:07.284 --> 00:38:07.818
SO THEN THEY WILL THEY'RE NOT

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.086
TRACKING HOW MANY WERE THEY

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.554
WERE NOT TRACKING. HOW MANY

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.922
WERE THERE DO YOU KNOW IF THERE

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:13.491
WAS A SYSTEM FOR THEM TO TRACK

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:14.125
THIS REPORT CARD WHERE DID THEY

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:16.661
GO THEY HAVE NOT THEY DIDN'T

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.962
SYSTEM THEY DURING THE AUDIT

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.263
THEY STARTED DEVELOPING A

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:21.732
TRACKING SHEET BUT HADN'T

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:26.037
STARTED USING IT. YET. OKAY SO

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.271
ARE RIGHT. SO WE HAVE A

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:29.874
RECOMMENDATION OKAY FOR THEM TO

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.275
START TRACKING FOR ITS TO

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:34.278
THINK. PARK TWO THINGS. SO FOR

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:36.447
THE JUDGES TO COMMUNICATE TO D.

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:37.548
W. C. THAT THEY REJECTED A

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:40.084
REPORT AND THEN FOR. D. W. C.

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.687
TO THAT ALSO TRACK THE REPORTS.

00:38:42.753 --> 00:38:44.655
OKAY WALL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS I

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:45.222
THINK BECAUSE HOW OLD TO THE

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:48.793
INJURED WORKERS NOW. SOMEONE

00:38:48.859 --> 00:38:50.261
BECAUSE HE OKAY SO LET ME

00:38:50.327 --> 00:38:52.496
RETRACT. SO WHEN YOU SAID THAT

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:56.434
WHEN. SOME OF THESE. REPORTS

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:00.271
WERE NOT- COMPLETED THEY WOULD

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:01.539
HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN

00:39:01.605 --> 00:39:04.308
SEOUL IF A REPORT WAS REJECTED

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:07.645
WHAT WAS THE REMEDY FOR THE

00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:10.147
INJURED WORKER CHIU THEN.

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:12.550
APPEAL MAY BE OR DO ANYTHING A

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.485
BASED ON THE REJECTION AND WHO

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:16.020
WOULD THEY GO TO CAN THEY GO

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.955
BACK TO THAT THE COURT OR OR TO

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:19.223
THE JUDGE OR WOULD THEY HAVE TO

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.193
GO THROUGH. THE W. C. AND THEN

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:22.793
AT THAT POINT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.695
THESE REPORT ARE. WHAT IT WHAT

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.197
WAS THE REMEDY FOR THE

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:30.534
REJECTION. SO WHEN THEY REJECT

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:33.404
THE REPORT- IT'S REALLY THAT

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.906
THE- THE- INJURED WORKER WILL

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.341
THEN HAVE TO GO BACK EITHER

THROUGH THE QUEUE ME PROCESS TO

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.212
SEE A NEW KILL ME. SO THAT THEY

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:42.913
CAN EVALUATE THEM AGAIN. AND

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.749
THEN PRODUCE A NEW REPORT THAT

00:39:44.815 --> 00:39:46.784
CAN BE USED OKAY SO THEN THEM

00:39:46.851 --> 00:39:49.453
OUT AS FAR AS TIME FRAME- YOU

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.689
SAID THAT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. OF

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.657
A REQUEST THEN THERE'S A CURE

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.059
ME AND IF THERE WAS NOT AN

00:39:55.126 --> 00:39:56.761
AVAILABLE KIMMY THEN WE HAVE TO

00:39:56.827 --> 00:39:58.429
START ALL OVER AGAIN SO- IN

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.564
TERMS OF TIME WAITING WHAT IS

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:03.501
YOUR ESTIMATE OR IF. IF I'M

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.804
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW A YEAR TWO

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:10.040
YEARS OF WAITING. BEFORE ANY OF

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:12.276
THESE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED.

00:40:12.343 --> 00:40:13.244
BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRACK THE

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:17.715
REJECTED REPORTS WE DON'T HAVE

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.517
ABOUT THE WAITING BUT- BUT WHEN

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.318
WE DID LOOK AT IN THAT FIRST

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.253
SECTION WHEN THERE'S A

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:24.421
REPLACEMENT PANEL THEY OFTEN IT

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:25.523
WAS DELAYED MORE THAN. TWO

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:28.025
MONTHS THAT'S A- GRAPH THAT

QUADRUPLED SINCE TWENTY

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:31.762
THIRTEEN RIGHT. RIGHT BUT BUT

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:34.231
THECONCERN THE CONCERN IS

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.800
TWOFOLD DIVISION OF WORKERS

RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THE

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:38.536
REPORTS THEY HAVE A

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:40.037
RESPONSIBILITY TO TRACK THE

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.339
REPORTS. BECAUSE STATE LAW

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.475
REQUIRES SUGGESTS THAT IF THE

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:47.411

THE DIVISION HAS A

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.617

ANECDOTAL INFORMATION AND

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.642
THAT'S THE PROBLEM SO- THE

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.410
DIVISION NEEDS TO DO A BETTER

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:54.879
JOB THE JUDGES AND THEY THEY

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:57.114
ASSERTED DURING THE COURSE OF

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.883
THE AUDIT THEY WOULD START

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:02.786
TRACKING. REJECTED REPORT SO

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:05.623
NOW WOULD BE AN MISSION HOPE

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:07.725
THE DIVISION HAS MEASURE. OF

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:09.426
TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S BEEN SEVEN.

00:42:09.493 --> 00:42:11.829
HOW MANY REJECTED ARE YOU

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:12.363
TRACKING IT BY Q. A ME YOU

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:13.097
SHOULD BE ARE YOU IDENTIFYING

00:42:13.163 --> 00:42:14.298
ISSUES IN THOSE REPORT WHAT ARE

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:15.332
THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:17.034
REPORTS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:18.769
TELL YOU YOU NEED TO DO A

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:19.570
BETTER JOB OF TRAINING

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:22.139
ACADEMIES TO PREPARE BETTER

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:25.342
QUALITY REPORTS- SO WE DON'T

00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:26.677
HAVE THE ANSWER FOR YOU MS

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:29.013
RUBIO AS FAR AS WHAT THE DELAY

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.881
AS AS AS MISS SAUNDERS

00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:32.716
INDICATED A REPLACEMENT PANEL

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:33.951
TYPICALLY IS GOING TO DELAY IT

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:36.420
AT LEAST ANOTHER SIXTY DAYS BY-

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.923
IF NOT LONGER ALL IN SOME CASES

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:41.025
IF IT'S- THE JUDGE SAYING OUT

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.226
WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER Q. ON ME

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:43.694
WE NEED A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.029
THEN THAT Q. AND ME IS DOING

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:47.031
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR THEY-

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:47.932
AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:49.900
TO DEPOSE THE CURE ME SO IT

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.302
CLEARLY CREATES ADDITIONAL

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:53.537
DELAY AT A MINIMUM IT'S GOING

00:42:53.604 --> 00:42:55.139
TO BE A PROBABLY A SIXTY DAY

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:57.942
DELAY IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE

00:42:58.008 --> 00:42:59.677
EVEN LONGER WELL AND THEN ON

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:01.545
THE FLIP SIDE YOU SAID THAT

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:05.115
AFTER A CURE ME GETS FIVE

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:06.250
REPORT JACK DEAD AND THEY'RE NO

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.451
LONGER. THEY WEREN'T EVEN

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.853
PACKING SO EVEN IN THE EVENT

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.189
THAT THERE WERE SOME BACK YOU

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.325
AND IS WE WERE NEED AND KICKING

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.126
YOU KNOW REJECTING THEM.

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:16.627
BECAUSE OF THE OF FAILED

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:17.594
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S KEEPING

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.729
TRACK THAT'S CORRECT AND

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:19.630
THERE'S A STATE LAW THAT ROUTE

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:23.901
THE REGARD REAPPOINTMENT RIGHT

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:26.136
IF I AS A Q. AND ME HAVE HAD

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:27.237
FOR MORE THAN FIVE FIVE I THINK

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:29.006
IT'S MORE THAN FIVE REJECTED- I

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.307
CANNOT GET REAPPOINTED AS A CUE

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:32.576
ME SO THEN WE HAVE THE OPPOSITE

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:33.777
PROBLEM THAT SOME OF THE BAG

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:35.145
AND THESE WERE NOT EVEN BEING

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:38.649
REJECTED CORRECT BECAUSE

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:39.216
NOBODY'S KEEPING TRACK OKAY

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:43.153
CORRECT. THANK YOU. I DON'T

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.722
KNOW IF YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:45.222
PRESENTATION OF FINE. OF

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:47.291
SENATOR ROTH AND- UP I WOULD

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:47.791
JUST LIKE AT SOME POINT

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:48.625
SOMEBODY TO ANSWER THE I'VE GOT

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.193
OTHER QUESTIONS BUT ON THIS

00:43:49.259 --> 00:43:49.893
PARTICULAR POINT. SO WHEN A

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.495
QUEUE IN ME HAS A REJECTED

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.230
REPORT THAT A JUDGE DETERMINES

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.732
IS INSUFFICIENT DOES THE QUEUE

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:57.067
IN ME AND IS THE CURE MAY

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:57.634
ENTITLED TO BE PAID FOR THAT

00:43:57.701 --> 00:44:00.204
REPORT. INMATE AT BEST MAYBE

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.472
THE QUESTION NEEDS TO GO TO DID

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:04.241
OF YOU SEE. BUT IF PART OF THE

00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:05.309
PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:07.077
DETERMINED TO DETERMINE

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.078
LEGISLATIVE FIXES TO THIS

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.314
PROCESS. AND IF SOMEBODY IS

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:12.349
TURNING OUT. REPORTS THAT ARE

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.484
REJECTED AND THEY DON'T GET

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.619
PAID. THEN I SUGGEST THAT

00:44:15.686 --> 00:44:17.187
THEY'LL PROBABLY EITHER FIX THE

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.722
REPORTS IN THE FUTURE OR THEY

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:20.457
WILL DROP OFF THE QUEUE IN THE

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:21.892
PANEL WE CAN REPLACE THEM WITH

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:23.994
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS A TO DO THE

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:24.995
JOB. THIS MADE UP A QUESTION DO

00:44:25.062 --> 00:44:27.264
YOU I'M- CONTENT TO WAIT TO THE

00:44:27.331 --> 00:44:28.432
NEXT PANEL BUT I'D LIKE FOR

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:29.600
SOMEBODY ANSWERED BEFORE WE

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:32.269
FINISH. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.137
APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE

00:44:33.203 --> 00:44:35.739
ANSWER THAT QUESTION I WOULD

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:36.273
ASSUME THAT. HOPE THAT THE

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:40.010
DIVISION WOULD HAVE THAT. GREAT

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:40.911
JEFF ANYTHING ELSE- I WOULD

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:43.447
JUST GOING TO CLOSE IT OUT WITH

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.049
JUST OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:47.317
MENTION THAT THE TWO BEFORE TO

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.453
SO THAT THE RECOMMENDATION FOR

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:51.021
THE JUDGES WHEN THEY REJECT

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.690
THEM TO TRACK TO TELL THE WC

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:56.026
AND THEN FOR D. W. C. TO TRACK

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:58.562
THEM BUT THEN ALSO AS I SAY THE

00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:00.097
BEGINNING THE OTHER TWO THINGS

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.565
THAT NEED TO BE SEE WAS NOT

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.033
DOING WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.935
FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH POLICIES

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.136
PROCEDURES FOR HOW THEY'RE

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.604
GOING TO DO THAT RAND SELECTION

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:09.473
YOU FOR QUALITY. AND THEN TO

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.240
FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REPORT

00:45:10.307 --> 00:45:12.042
THAT TO THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.676
DIRECTOR WITH THE

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:15.779
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO AGAIN

00:45:15.846 --> 00:45:17.981
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.350
BECAUSE YOU THE THESE. FOR

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:20.918
QUALITY REPORTS COULD

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:23.120
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO DELAYS FOR

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:24.054
THE INJURED WORKER AND

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:24.955
INCREASED COSTS FOR THE

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:27.124
EMPLOYERS. OKAY THANK YOU THANK

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.026
YOU LET ME ASK JUST ONE FOLLOW

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:29.827
UP BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.928
TO BE HEARD AND FOR THE NEXT

00:45:30.994 --> 00:45:34.531
PANEL. IN THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:35.099
RESPONSE TO THE AUDITS THEY

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:39.369
OBVIOUSLY. I DON'T AGREE WITH.

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:40.237
WITH YOUR ASSERTION THAT

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:42.706
THERE'S A LACK OF TWO EMMYS

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:44.041
RIGHT CAN YOU JUST ELABORATE A

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.642
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT AND WHY

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:47.144
YOU DISAGREE WITH THEIR

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:50.013
RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT. WELL I

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.448
THINK THE INFORMATION IN THE

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:52.182
REPORT CERTAINLY IN THE

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.584
GRAPHICS ILLUSTRATE THAT

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.085
THERE'S A PROBLEM AS FAR AS THE

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:56.453
NUMBER OF JIMMY'S AVAILABLE

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.522
WHEN YOU HAVE. A DECLINE IN THE

00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:59.923
NUMBER OF Q. ENEMIES AND YOU

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.559
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT A 37%

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:04.194
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:07.331
REQUESTS FOR PANELS. ANALYSTS

00:46:07.397 --> 00:46:08.866
TO CHOOSE FROM AND THEN YOU SEE

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.767
THE STATISTICS WE IDENTIFIED

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.102
WHERE YOU'VE GOT REPLACEMENT

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:15.072
PANELS. SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:17.274
BECAUSE AQ ME WAS NOT AVAILABLE

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:18.942
TO PROVIDE TO CONDUCT THAT

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:21.512
EVALUATION QUADRUPLING IN A

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:22.946
FIVE YEAR WINDOW. THAT'S A

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:25.883
PROBLEM- SO I WOULD STRONGLY

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:28.018
DISAGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT I

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:29.753
KNOW THEY HAVE HAD SOME STUDIES

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:32.756
DONE. WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING AT-

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:34.691
AYE AYE THERE WERE SOME QUEUE

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:36.560
ENEMIES WHO HAVE OFFICES

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.060
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.395
CALIFORNIA SO MAYBE THEY'RE

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:40.831
GETTING SELECTED ON A- MORE Q.

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:41.832
AND MEET THEIR THEIR PART OF

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:44.301
MORE Q. M. B. PANELS. AND

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:47.204
BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE. PANELS

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.906
THERE AND NOT NECESSARILY

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:50.507
AVAILABLE BECAUSE IF THEY GET

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.241
SELECT FOR MY CASE OF

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.610
MICHELLE'S CASE AND MS RUBIO

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.679
CASE IT'S LIKE I CAN'T DO. I

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:56.880
CAN ONLY DO ONE. WITHIN THE

00:46:56.947 --> 00:47:00.217
NEXT THIRTY DAYS SO THESE TWO

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:02.319
INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO GO BACK FOR

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:04.988
A REPLACEMENT PANEL. AND THAT'S

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:08.525
WHY WE DID ANALYSIS BY ZIP CODE

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:10.761
WHICH IS THE WAY THAT IDENTIFY

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:11.662
THE KEY MEETINGS. ES DETERMINE

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:12.462
HAVE IS HAS THERE BEEN A

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:15.699
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF Q. AND

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:16.266
FEES IS IT CONCENTRATED LIKE

00:47:16.333 --> 00:47:18.802
THEIR ARGUED. AND WHAT WE FOUND

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:19.403
IS THAT IS NOT THE CASE BASED

00:47:19.469 --> 00:47:20.771
ON THE DATA WE LOOKED AT AND I

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:21.705
NEED TO LOOK AT MY NOTES

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:22.339
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET IT

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:25.242
WRONG- BUT WE HAD OUR I. T.

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:28.946
FOLKS. NEAR THE OKAY LET'S SEE

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:34.051
DID DID. THE DECREASE IN AND

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:35.686
THE NUMBER OF Q. AMIS RIGHT AS

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:37.487
I SAID QUADRUPLED THE DATA

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:38.655
SHOWS THAT CASES REQUIRE

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:40.090
REPLACEMENT POUNDS DO AVAILABLE

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:42.559
Q. M. E. NEARLY HALF THE TIME

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:43.894
THE CASE IS DELAYED BY TWO

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:47.164
MONTHS- AND THEN WE DID THE

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.032
ANALYSIS BY ZIP CODE I CAN'T

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.367
FIND IT IN MY NOTES RIGHT NOW

00:47:50.434 --> 00:47:52.436
BUT- BUT THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.738
THAT WE DID THAT SAID. THAT IS

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.573
NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE AS FAR

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.342
AS THE NUMBER OF Q. ENEMIES

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.577
THAT THERE BEING A PROBLEM WITH

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:02.312
RESPECT TO THE CONCENTRATION OF

00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:03.981
THE QUEUE ARMIES ARE IN

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:06.683
CALIFORNIA SO BUT AND I'VE

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:07.718
LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STUDIES

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:09.052
THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STUDIES

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:11.054
DONE YOU'LL ALSO IF YOU LOOKED

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.589
AT OUR RESPONSE THERE WERE WERE

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.625
WILLING TO STE TO STUDY THE-

00:48:14.691 --> 00:48:16.493
THE DECLINE WERE WILLING TO

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.262
STUDY THIS. THERE HAVE BEEN

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:20.731
ENOUGH STE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:21.331
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:24.001
DONE I THINK WITH OUR

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.003
RECOMMENDATION THAT THE

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.738
DIVISION NEEDS TO COME UP WITH

00:48:27.804 --> 00:48:30.641
A LAN TO ADDRESS THE MEDICAL

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:31.541
FEE SCHEDULE AS YOUR

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.610
LEGISLATION DOES. THAT'S

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:34.745
BECAUSE THEY GOT TO BE A

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:35.545
PROBLEM IF THAT HASN'T BEEN

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:38.749
RECENT THIRTEEN YOU JUST ST STE

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:39.283
PI IT WOULD GO UP OVER TWO

00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:42.719
HUNDRED DOCTORS. BUT WHAT WE'RE

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:44.254
SEEKING IS. THE USE OF DATA TO

00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.222
IDENTIFY WHAT SPECIALTIES ARE

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.291
DECLINING. WHAT AREAS IN THE

00:48:47.357 --> 00:48:48.859
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE WE

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.560
REALLY STRUGGLING AND HAVING.

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:52.062
MORE AND MORE REPLACEMENT

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:53.530
PANELS JUST BEING STRATEGIC

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:57.134
ABOUT. THE APPROACH IN. IN ART

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.969
RECRUITING Q. AND NEEDS TO BE

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:00.570
IN THE SYSTEM THEY HAD REACHED

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:02.739
OUT TO SOME PHYSICIANS IN.

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:05.075
MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND MEDICAL

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.243
GROUPS AND SOME OF THE MEDICAL

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.311
GROUPS ARE RELUCTANT TO LET

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:09.513
THEIR PHYSICIANS. IN FAIRNESS

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:10.881
TO THE DIVISION THEY HAVE TRIED

00:49:10.947 --> 00:49:12.649
THEY REACHED OUT WELL WE'RE

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:15.018
SUGGESTING CONTINUE TO DO THAT.

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:16.787
ARE AND THIS IS RIGHT ABOUT THE

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.488
NEEDS WELL I THINK IT'S FOR

00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:20.157
SPECIALTIES BUT ALSO FOR ANY

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.092
TYPE OF PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THOSE

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.761
MEDICAL GROUPS ARE MEN. WANT

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:25.495
THEIR PHYSICIANS TO BE

00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:28.465
TREATING. THEIR PATIENTS NOT

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:31.068
NECESSARILY TAKING TIME AWAY TO

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.903
CONDUCT THESE EVALUATIONS. SO

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:36.139
RECOMMENDATION IS. BY TWENTY

00:49:36.206 --> 00:49:38.041
APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WE

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:40.143
ALWAYS DOING OUR

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:40.744
RECOMMENDATIONS NOW DEVELOPING

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.412
A PLAN INCREASE THE NUMBER.

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:43.280
ACTIVELY RECRUIT. YOUR TIE

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.548
SPECIALTIES WITH THE GREATEST

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:45.182
SHORTAGES YOU HAVE THAT

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:47.617
INFORMATION START THERE- AND AN

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:50.053
ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.421
NOT CONTINUE NEGOTIATING WITH

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.724
MEDICAL GROUPS AS BEST YOU CAN

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.426
AND ESTABLISH GOALS TRACK HOW

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:58.028
WELL YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE WE

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.096
WEREN'T SEEING EVIDENCE OF THAT

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:01.231
BE THE DIVISION BEING MORE AND

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:03.400
MORE PROACTIVE- EVEN THOUGH

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.201
THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S A

00:50:04.267 --> 00:50:06.069
DECLINE. THEY'RE SUGGESTING

00:50:06.136 --> 00:50:08.472
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE AND AM I

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:10.240
STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH WITH

00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.141
THAT ASSERTION I MEAN THEY'RE

00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:13.577
ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION- WITH

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:16.113
RESPECT TO- THAT SOME OF THE

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:17.514
OTHER ISSUES WE HAVE IN THE

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.915
REPORT AS FAR AS THE DUE

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:21.885
PROCESS ISSUES. I JUST WANTED

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:23.720
TO QUICKLY GO OVER THEN THE

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.255
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT

00:50:25.322 --> 00:50:28.492
WE DISCUSS- AND WE ASK THEM FOR

00:50:28.558 --> 00:50:29.860

PACKAGE THAT'S JUST THE- THE AN

00:50:37.534 --> 00:50:39.035
ABBREVIATED VERSION I MEAN

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.003
THERE'S A POLITE LENGTHY TO.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:41.872
THE GATE DESPITE PROCESS THAT

00:50:41.938 --> 00:50:43.273
THEY FOLLOW WHEN WE ASK NUMBER

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.408
POLICIES PROCEED THEY GAVE US A

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:49.112
FLOW CHART. THAT STAFFER

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:51.014
SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THEY NEED TO

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.015
HAVE MORE SPECIFIC. SEASON

PROCEDURE FOR THE VESTED IN.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.385
FACT VERSES THE REQUIREMENTS I

00:50:55.452 --> 00:50:58.622
NEED TO KEEP SEPARATE THEY THEY

00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:03.593
HAVE FLAYED. SECULAR SO THERE

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:04.161
WAS NO REGULATION OUTLINING

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:06.797
WHAT PROCESS. NO WE DIDN'T SEE

00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:07.564
SPECIFIC POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES FOR STAFF TO FOLLOW

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.032
OF TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT THEY

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.000
SHOULD FOLLOW BUT THE TWO BUT

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:10.634
TO BE CLEAR YOU SAID THAT THEIR

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.168
SPECIFIC LAW THAT REQUIRES

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:13.336
THAT. IS THAT CORRECT. WELL

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:15.071
THERE THERE ARE SPECIFIC LAWS

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.907

THE AND THE RE APPOINTMENT I

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:24.214
MEAN IT REALLY TIES TO AND OUR

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:25.282
ATTORNEYS IN THE AUDIENCE YOU

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.920
WE'RE NOT SAYING DUE PROCESS IT

00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:32.355
IT MAY AFFECT DUE PROCESS

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:35.225
BECAUSE- IN SOME CASES. IT

00:51:35.292 --> 00:51:36.159
WASN'T A PROBLEM WHEN WE LOOKED

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:37.828
AT THE Q. M. Q. ENEMIES IN

00:51:37.894 --> 00:51:38.728
THERE. THE ALLEGATIONS OF

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:40.997
VIOLATIONS THE PROCESS WORKED

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.532
WE SAW SOME AND THE MOST

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.534
EGREGIOUS ONE. THAT I SAW WAS

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.036
THE ONE I ILLUSTRATED WHERE THE

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.337
ALLEGATION COMES IN TWENTY

00:51:47.404 --> 00:51:50.040
FOURTEEN. AND THEY WAIT UNTIL

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.808
YOU KNOW ALL ALMOST TWO YEARS

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:53.710
LATER. TO DENY THE

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:54.644
REAPPOINTMENT OF THAT

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:56.746
PARTICULAR Q. AND ME RATHER

00:51:56.813 --> 00:52:00.417
THAN ALLOWING. THE CASTIGATE OF

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.985
DISCIPLINARY PROCESS TO PLAY

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:03.220
ITSELF OUT ALLOW THE QUEUE

PERFORM SERVICES AND FULLY

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:10.627
RESOLVE THAT SITUATION THE

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:16.566
ALLEGATION WAS SUBSTANTIATED

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:19.035
NOT. IT WAS NOT. THE AND-

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:22.072
WOULDN'T HAVE THE ISSUE OF.

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:22.906
FIFTEEN MONTHS LATER IS NOT

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.708
ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:26.443
HURTS THAT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.345
BUT IT ALSO HURTS THE WORKERS

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.613
WHO COULD HAVE. RECEIVE

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:30.947
SERVICES FROM THAT PARTICULAR

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:33.283
EVALUATOR SO GREAT WE REALLY

00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.819
HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT SO. ALL

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.954
OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:41.591
DIVISION SUGGEST THAT THEY THEY

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:44.427
GET THESE PLANS TOGETHER

00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:46.363
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AT

00:52:46.429 --> 00:52:54.037
CETERA. QUESTIONS WHAT SOUNDS

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.171
LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

00:52:55.238 --> 00:52:56.873
FOR THE NEXT PANEL. SO WITH

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.508
THAT WE'RE GONNA GO WITH US AND

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.310
ROTH SINCE SINGER MORE LOCKED

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:01.044

RECOMMENDATIONS CERTAINLY WE

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:09.386
NEED TO PAY PEOPLE

00:53:09.452 --> 00:53:10.453
APPROPRIATELY FOR THE SERVICES

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.155
THAT THEY PROVIDE IT'S

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.857
OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM OBVIOUS

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.092
IT'S PROBLEM HERE IN WORKERS

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:16.660
COMP JUST AS IT IS WITH MEDI

00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:19.496
CAL ON A FEW OF THE OTHER IS

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:20.230
WHERE. PROVIDERS PROVIDE

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:22.666
SERVICES TO OTHERS. I'M JUST

00:53:22.732 --> 00:53:24.634
WONDERING IF THIS. SO CALLED

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:25.869
SHORTAGE ISSUE IN THE

00:53:25.936 --> 00:53:27.170
AVAILABILITY OF Q. MAYES AS

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:28.805
PART OF A LARGER ISSUE YOU KNOW

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.206
THAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:31.308
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.076
CERTAINLY FOR THE- NOW GOING ON

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:35.779
EIGHT YEARS THAT I'VE- I'VE

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:37.514
BEEN UP HERE. AND THAT IS THE

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.149
SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS OVERALL

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.383
IN THE STATE I DON'T KNOW IF

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.018
YOU. TOOK A LOOK AT THAT I MEAN

00:53:42.085 --> 00:53:43.219
THE STATISTICS THAT NOBODY

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:44.621
SEEMS TO DISPUTE IS THAT WE'RE

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:46.856
GONNA BE SHORT. OVER EIGHT

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:47.324
THOUSAND PRIMARY CARE

THE WORKERS COMPARABLE- WE ALSO

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:03.840

BECOMING AS EXTINCT AS THE

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:20.123

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:21.518
THAT. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.420
IN THE REPORT SENATOR WE

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.722
ACTUALLY- REFERENCE TO A UC

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:27.590
STUDY THAT TALKS ABOUT-

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.959
PHYSICIANS THE NUMBER OF

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:31.361
PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:33.797
ACTUALLY INCREASING HOWEVER THE

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:37.667
NUMBER BEING- NOT NEARLY ENOUGH

00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:38.702
BASED ON OUR OVERALL

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:41.171
POPULATION- SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE

00:55:41.237 --> 00:55:43.807
IT WE DIDN'T GO INTO DOING US A

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:46.676
DETAILED ANALYSIS OF. PRIMARY

00:55:46.743 --> 00:55:47.744
CARE PHYSICIANS VERSUS

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.379
SPECIALIST AT CETERA SO WE

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:51.314
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS A

00:55:51.381 --> 00:55:53.316
CHALLENGE THAT THE DIVISION

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:55.351
CERTAINLY FACES ARE IN

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:57.721
IDENTIFYING Q. AMIS BECAUSE

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.923
THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.225
PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA AND-

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:05.095
THAT CERTAINLY- WILL LEND

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.297
ITSELF TO A SITUATION IN IN

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:09.766
THIS PARTICULAR AREA WHERE.

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:12.335
THERE THERE- IF THERE'S A TICK

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:13.570
THERE ISN'T A DECLINE IN NUMBER

00:56:13.636 --> 00:56:15.338
PHYSICIANS AND IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:17.140
BUT CERTAIN SPECIALTIES

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.241
ABSOLUTELY THERE HAS BEEN A

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:21.344
DECLINE- AND WE IDENTIFIED IN

00:56:21.411 --> 00:56:24.180
THE REPORT- THAT THE DATA THAT

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:26.516
THE DIVISION HAS THAT IT CAN

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:29.786
USE. TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WHICH

00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:30.820
SPECIAL LEASE ORTHOPEDICS

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.189
ABSOLUTELY AS ONE THERE ARE

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.257
SOME OTHERS THAT THAT WE

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:36.259
ANECDOTALLY MENTION BASED ON

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:39.162
THEIR DATA SO WE DIDN'T GO INTO

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.997
A BIG OVERALL DETAILED

00:56:41.064 --> 00:56:43.666
ANALYSIS. OF THE SUPPLY OF

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.535
PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.336
SUPPLY OF SPECIALISTS IN

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:48.204
CALIFORNIA AND HOW THAT WOULD

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:51.040
TIED TO THIS PARTICULAR-

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:51.808
WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAM

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.710
FOR KILOMETERS- BUT WE DO WE DO

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.512
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS ONE OF

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:56.513
THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

00:56:56.579 --> 00:56:58.114
DIVISION FACES ONE OF THE

00:56:58.181 --> 00:56:59.716
COMMENTS IN THE DEED OF UC'S

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:03.052
ROUTE RESPONSE WHICH I DON'T

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.053
KNOW IF YOU. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.556
TO. PROVIDE A DETAILED RESPONSE

00:57:06.623 --> 00:57:09.159
TO. DATA AS OUTLINED BELOW

00:57:09.225 --> 00:57:11.961
SHOWS THAT ONLY 50% OF OUR

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:12.562
CURRENT Q. IN THE PHYSICIANS

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:14.998
ARE BEING ASSIGNED TO PANELS.

00:57:15.064 --> 00:57:17.000
AND THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME AND I

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.735
PLAN TO AS CITY TO BE SEE ABOUT

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:20.503
THAT BECAUSE THE NOTE THAT I

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.038
WROTE IN THE IN THE MARGIN FOR

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.774
ME IS WHY. DID YOU WILL LOOK AT

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.876
THAT WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:27.443
YOU ENCOUNTERED DURING YOUR

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.547
AUDIT. WELL WE THAT WAS IN

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:33.149
THEIR RESPONSE- SO I DON'T KNOW

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:33.716
THAT IT CAME UP DURING THE

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:34.951
COURSE OF THE AUDIT BUT WHAT WE

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:38.154
DO. SAY IN OUR COMMENTS TO

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:39.289
THEIR RESPONSES THIS STUDY THEY

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.457
THEY BASE THAT ON. IT LOOKED AT

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:43.927
ABOUT A SIX MONTH WINDOW IN

00:57:43.993 --> 00:57:45.528
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WE FEEL

00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:47.864
THAT. THAT THAT DOESN'T

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:50.633
NECESSARILY REFLECT. WHAT HAS

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.202
HAPPENED OVER THE FIVE YEAR

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:53.703
WINDOW THAT WE LOOKED AT AND

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.238
EVEN THAT STUDY ACKNOWLEDGE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:57.907
THAT. IT WAS A SHORT TIME FRAME

00:57:57.974 --> 00:58:00.143
AND THAT PERCENTAGE COULD BE.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.978
GREATER OUT LOOKING AT A LONGER

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:04.214
TIME FRAME IT'S A PROCESS ISSUE

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.684
IF. BROUGH CHAIR- RIGHT THAT

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.085
THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH I WAS

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:11.621
JUST I'M JUST TRYING NOW I GET

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:12.222
TO GROUND ZERO ON THIS AND OUT

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:14.958
OF. BE SURE TO ASK THEM WHEN

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:15.625
THEY'RE UP HERE. THIS WANTED TO

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:16.860
KNOW IF YOU HAD A PARTICULAR

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.728
PERSPECTIVE ON THANK YOU MISTER

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:20.597
CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MORE

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:22.932
WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.767
WHEN CAN I GO FROM THE MICRO TO

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.803
THE MACRO IN. OF THE WITH WITH

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:29.072
YOUR PLEASURE I GUESS BUT- THAT

00:58:29.138 --> 00:58:33.376
THE MICRO IS ON THE Q. AMIS.

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:33.977
HOW MANY ARE ACTIVE POSITIONS

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:37.046
AND HOW MANY ARE RETIRED. NOW I

00:58:37.113 --> 00:58:37.914
DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER THAT

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.916
QUESTION CENTER I APOLOGIZE

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:43.820
SELECT JUDGES WORK FOR. WHAT

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:45.321
WOULD YOU CALL IT- NEVER

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:47.724
TRADERS THE YOU KNOW THEY DO

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:49.392
CONSULTING ARE BETTER

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:50.860
REPUTATION ARBITRATIONS BUT I

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.128
JUST WONDER IF THERE'S SOME

00:58:52.195 --> 00:58:54.197
YEAH POOL OF RETIRED- DOCTORS

00:58:54.264 --> 00:58:55.498
THAT WOULD WOULD WORK FOR Q.

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:57.533
ENEMIES YEAH AND AGAIN I THINK

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.668
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY

00:58:58.735 --> 00:59:00.270
THE DIVISION WOULD HAVE THAT

00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:01.304
INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT WOULD

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:02.839
BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. BUT

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:04.140
IN WAY IN OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:06.109
THAT MISS SAUNDERS- MENTIONED

00:59:06.175 --> 00:59:08.177
IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PLAN

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:10.346
FOR RECRUITING IT'S ALSO USING

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:15.018
INFORMATION AND PROJECTING- AND

00:59:15.084 --> 00:59:17.053
IT AND LOOKING AT THE MIX OF

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.188
TWO ARMIES ARE VAST MAJORITY

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:21.858
KIMI'S RETIRED POSITION SO EVEN

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:23.026
THOUGH A PHYSICIAN DECIDES TO

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.627
RETIRE DOESN'T WANT. TO SEE

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:27.196
PATIENTS ANYMORE IS HAVE AN

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:29.766
INTERVIEW WE SHOULD RECRUIT

00:59:29.832 --> 00:59:30.967
POTENTIALLY BE A U. M. B. FOR A

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:36.406
CALIFORNIA SO I DON'T HAVE THE

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:36.973
ANSWER SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:37.607
QUESTION HOPEFULLY THE DIVISION

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.142
DOES. IF NOT THAT ONLY A

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:40.410
SUGGESTION THAT THEY SHOULD.

00:59:40.476 --> 00:59:41.611
INCLUDE IN THEIR PLAN WHEN THEY

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:42.445
LOOK AT PROJECTION. LET'S SEE

00:59:42.512 --> 00:59:43.780
HOW MANY. HOW PHYSICIANS ARE

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.949
WHO ARE RETIRED ARE WILLING OR

00:59:46.015 --> 00:59:48.851
ARE HAVE CONSIDERED BECOMING A

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:49.485
CUE I MEET PARTICULARLY IF THE

00:59:49.552 --> 00:59:50.286

INTEGRATION SO. IF I COULD STEP

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.467
BACK FROM THIS AUDIT- AND LOOK

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.402

ARE ASSESSING WHAT RESOURCES WE

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.622

LEGALIZATION QB'S CURRENT AT

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:57.933
THE HOW. Q. A- DAY BASIS

UTILIZED STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.601
THAT ABOUT FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:00.902
PERCENT. A PANEL REQUESTS ARE

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:01.570
GIVEN 210% OF Q. AND MEANS. THE

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:03.805
ON THE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS ACU

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:04.673
NY COULD LIST. THERE WAS ALL

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:07.109
TOP LIMIT OF TEN. AND IT WAS

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:08.043
EXPECTED THAT THIS WOULD REDUCE

HIGH VOLUME Q. AMIS WITH LARGE

TWO REGISTERS ACU ME BUT WE DID

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.120
NOT SEE THIS OF FACT. IN TWO

MEDICAL REVIEW. THIS WAS

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:24.159
EXPECTED TO DECREASE THE NUMBER

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.627
OF Q. ANY REQUEST BECAUSE Q.

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:26.895

QUADRUPLING OF THE PANELS WHICH

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.149
YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:44.586
ADDRESS AS WELL- DO YOU AGREE

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:45.687
WITH THOSE NUMBERS AND THAT'S

01:23:45.754 --> 01:23:46.888
WHAT'S HAPPENING OR WHAT WE'VE

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:49.023
SEEN I AGREE WITH THE NUMBERS I

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.258
MEAN THE NUMBER I THINK THE

01:23:50.325 --> 01:23:52.060
NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES-

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:53.528
BUT WE WANT TO DO IS TRY TO

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:57.098
FIGURE OUT TO GET HOW DO WE WHY

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:57.632
DO WE REACH A SOLUTION TO

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.300
CREATE A MORE. EFFICIENT SYSTEM

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.436
WITH SB EIGHT SIXTY AS I

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:02.704
MENTIONED WE THOUGHT THE NUMBER

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.506
REQUESTED GO DOWN TAKE AWAY THE

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:05.874
SPECIFICS AND- WHAT IT MEANS

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:06.908
DECIDED MOVES WERE TREATMENT

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.510
DISPUTES AND YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:09.444
OUR INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:10.478
NUMBERS TO SEE HOW THOSE

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.980
NUMBERS OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:13.014
PLAYING UP THOSE NUMBERS ARE

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.416
HIGH BUT INSTEAD. INSTEAD OF

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:16.217
SEEING A DECREASE WE SAW AN

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:19.154
INCREASE- AGAIN THERE'S A

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.188
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LITIGATION

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:22.424
SYSTEM A LOT OF FRICTION BOB

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:24.259
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SYSTEM

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:27.195
FIXES. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:27.829
AT THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.464
AT ALL THE ALL THE OBLIGATION

01:24:29.531 --> 01:24:31.699
ALL THE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:37.105
LAYERED OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:37.672
WORKERS COMPENSATION. THAT'S

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:41.643
RIGHT PEEL BACK. YES THERE'S A

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:42.610
BURRITO BUT- WE'RE DEALING

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:43.578
ONION. HERE WE GOT A LOT OF

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:44.212
LAYERS OF OBLIGATIONS OVER THE

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:45.213
DECADE. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:45.747
AT THAT AND SEE HOW DO WE

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:46.915
CREATE A SIMPLER. MORE

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.583
EFFICIENT SYSTEM WITH LESS

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.084
FRICTION BECAUSE A TREMENDOUS

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:50.952
AMOUNT OF THE DOLLARS THAT ARE

01:24:51.019 --> 01:24:53.822
SPENT WORKERS COMPENSATION.

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:54.322
GOES INTO THAT CATEGORY

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:58.092
FRICTION. OF SO I SO I THINK WE

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.727
NEED TO LOOK AT REALLY WHAT IS

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:01.996
GOING ON IS THERE AN ADEQUATE

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.832
NUMBER OF CUBAN THESE. I DON'T

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:06.100
STE I WOULD SAY THERE IS I WILL

01:25:06.167 --> 01:25:08.570
SAY I DON'T KNOW. THERE COULD

01:25:08.636 --> 01:25:10.438
BE WE UNDER UTILIZED OUR Q.

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:13.408
AMIS AND I THINK WORK WE WANT

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:14.476
TO TAKE A LOOK A THAT AS I

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.678
SAY. THE ALGORITHMS THAT WE

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:18.513
ASSIGN Q. AMIS NOW WHY IS IT

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:19.781
THAT SO MANY Q. M. IS THAT ARE

01:25:19.848 --> 01:25:21.316
UNAVAILABLE GET ON THE PANEL

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:23.084
AND YET WE HAVE SOME Q. AMIS.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.053
WHO DON'T GET ON A PANEL- I

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:26.421
TALKED TO ONE PHYSICIAN WHO

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.122
BECAME THE Q. M. E. AND HE

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.291
DROPPED OUT AFTER A FEW YEARS

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:30.925
BECAUSE HE JUST WASN'T GETTING

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:32.327
ANY PANELS YOU KNOW AND THAT'S

01:25:32.393 --> 01:25:34.863
THAT'S- ON US NOT SOMETHING WE

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:36.698
NEED TO RESOLVE. WE ARE LOOKING

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:37.232
INTO THAT YEAH WITH THE

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:40.502
pHEARD THAT DIRECTLY TO FROM

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:42.670
SOME FOLKS ARE NOT EVEN.

01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:43.271
INVOLVED IN THE CAPITAL WORLD

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:45.940
APPEARS ANECDOTALLY BACK HOME.

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:47.308
TOLD ME THAT SAME EXACT RIDE

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:48.810
AREA RIGHT I THOUGHT SO CUTS

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.578
PROP. AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU

01:25:50.645 --> 01:25:52.547
KNOW THAT'S ON US THAT'S

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:53.314
SOMETHING WE'RE GOING WE'RE

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:54.749
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.418
THAT WHY APPRECIATE THAT AND

01:25:57.485 --> 01:25:57.986
YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE THE

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:58.453

DOWN TO WHAT ARE THINGSTHAT WE

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:06.394
CAN FIX HOW WE MAKE THE SYSTEM

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:07.395
BETTER. OKAY IN MY OPENING

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:07.962
STATEMENTS I THINK THERE'S A

01:26:08.029 --> 01:26:09.531
WIN WIN HERE THAT CAN. DECREASE

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:10.865
COSTS FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:13.434
BUT- GET WORKERS TREATED FASTER

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.802
AND HOPEFULLY BACK ON THE JOB A

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:17.639
LOT SOONER. I AGREE AND WE ARE

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:18.673
WE ARE TAKING STEPS IN THOSE

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.008
DIRECTIONS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.442
OUR- OUR MEDICAL TREATMENT

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:23.378
UTILIZATION SCHEDULED MOVING TO

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.046
EVIDENCED BASED GUIDELINES. YOU

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.548
KNOW WE ONE INJURED WORKERS TO

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:27.615
GET TREATMENT AS SOON AS

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:29.417
POSSIBLE. AND WE FIND THAT WHEN

01:26:29.484 --> 01:26:30.785
THAT TREATMENTS PROVIDED EARLY

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:33.421
ON THEN THAT THEY GET BACK TO

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.389
WORK WHICH IS WHAT. EVERYBODY

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:36.391
WANTS TO SEE AND- AND SO YOU

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:37.792

ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:46.935
DOING TO REPAIRS. A RECRUIT.

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:48.636
MORE QUALIFIED MEDICAL

01:26:48.703 --> 01:26:50.805
EVALUATORS. WELL AS I MENTIONED

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.941
BEFORE I THINK WE NEED TO REACH

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.610
OUT TO Q. TO DOCTOR. PER CUBIC

01:26:55.677 --> 01:26:57.111
METER DROPPED OUT OF THE SYSTEM

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.680
I THINK WE NEED TO TALK. MEDIC

01:26:58.746 --> 01:26:59.647
TO MORE OF MEDICAL GROUPS LONG

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:00.648
TERM MEDICAL GROUPS WE NEED TO

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.216
TALK TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.185
CALIFORNIA TO SEE WHAT WE WHAT.

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.753
WE CAN DO TO BRING THEM IN. AND

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:07.889
I THINK WE NEED TO BE. A LITTLE

01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:09.057
CREATIVE AS TO HOW WE CAN BRING

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.792
IN. I CAN'T FORCE ANYBODY I

01:27:10.858 --> 01:27:12.126
CAN'T FORCE ANYBODY TO QUEUE UP

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:13.227
TO BE A QUEUE IN THE I CAN

01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:14.696
AUTOMATICALLY. STAY THAT I CAN

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:17.198
INCREASE THE NUMBER. WE CAN FIX

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:18.800
OUR MEDICAL OUR MEDICAL LEGAL

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:20.301
FEE SCHEDULE AND I. HAD A

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:22.036
REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:24.672
OF ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.041
PROVIDERS EMPLOYERS ATTORNEYS

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:28.509
TO WORK AND WORK IN THAT

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:30.778
DIRECTION. BUT IF I INCREASED

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:32.347
PIZZA DOESN'T MEAN I'M GOING TO

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:34.882
GET MORE Q. ENEMIES AND WE SAW

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:37.885
THAT TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN WE

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:39.654
INCREASE THE FEE SCHEDULE. AND

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:40.188
WE STILL SOFT DROP IN THE

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:43.458
NUMBER OF KEEP IT MEANS. WE

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:45.693
WILL CERTAIN WE WILL CERTAINLY.

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.895
PUT IN THE EFFORT TO DO THAT WE

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:49.831
WILL CERTAINLY REACH OUT TO

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:53.334
GROUPS AND WE'LL- WE'LL HAVE.

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:55.870
BETTER MORE SIMPLER FEE

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:56.838
SCHEDULE FEE SCHEDULE IT'S MORE

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:57.672
PREDICTABLE THAT EVERYBODY CAN

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:58.239
UPSET. THE OTHER BY MULTIPLE

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.207
FACTORS AGO. THAT BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:00.108
THINKING CREASING. SCHEDULE

MIGHT. ANSWER LIES OR CUBIES TO

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:06.781
COME FORWARD. AND MAYBE WE NEED

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:07.415
TO TALK ABOUT THE SCENARIO THAT

01:28:07.482 --> 01:28:08.016
YOU BROUGHT UP WHERE. PEOPLE A

01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:12.553
QUAL. FI'S QB'S ARE GETTING THE

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:13.187
REFERRALS WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:13.821
OF AN ALGORITHM. OUR OTHER FACT

01:28:13.888 --> 01:28:14.756
GET A FIGURE OUT HOW WE KEEP

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:15.356
THEM IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE IF

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:16.624
THEY'RE STILL. WE'RE STILL

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:17.925
SEEING MORE THAN SIXTY DAY

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:18.593
DELAYS PEOPLE AREN'T BEING SEEN

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.360
WE GOT TO FIGURE THAT PROCESS

01:28:19.427 --> 01:28:19.961
OUT OF I THINK THAT'S WHERE A

01:28:20.028 --> 01:28:20.595
LOT OF THE QUESTIONS. FROM THE

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.764
PANEL EARLIER ACTUALLY KINDA

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.065
STEMMING FROM AN SUBSTRING

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:26.167
FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE GET TO

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:27.635
THAT POINT AND WHAT IS IT WE

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:29.370
NEED TO GET DONE TO IT TO GET

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:31.139
THERE. YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:32.874
ADOPTING NEW- RULES AND

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:35.910
REGULATIONS AND THEN ALSO THE

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.679
FEE SCHEDULE. BUT I DIDN'T HEAR

01:28:37.745 --> 01:28:38.713
A TIME LINE IN ANY OF THAT YOU

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.515
GIVE A- KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:28:40.581 --> 01:28:41.282
LOOKING AT AT THE DEPARTMENT

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.084
AND KIND OF THE TIMELINE OF.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.686
WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE SOME OF

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:46.187
THIS MOVING FORWARD WELL I

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.722
WOULD LIKE OUR FOR OUR OUR

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:49.757
STAKEHOLDERS ARE MEETING RIGHT

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:50.792
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT

01:28:50.858 --> 01:28:53.394
PROCESS DONE AND IN THE EARLY

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:54.362
SPRING THAT WE WOULD MOVE AHEAD

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:56.064
WITH REGULATIONS AT THAT POINT.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.498
NO SOME SOME OF OUR

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:58.900
STAKEHOLDERS ARE SAYING DON'T

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:01.769
MOVE TOO FAST. NO BECAUSE AGAIN

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.870
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:04.205
WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:05.707
SOMETHING OF A GLOBAL SOLUTION.

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:06.574
ON SOME THINK THAT WE'RE NOT

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:09.610
MOVING FAST ENOUGH I THINK WE

01:29:09.677 --> 01:29:10.411
JUST HAVE TO SEE WHERE OUR

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:11.345
DISCUSSIONS GO AND WHAT

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:13.681
AGREEMENT BEING REACHED I WOULD

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.083
LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE

01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:18.920
TO REACH AGREEMENT- BECAUSE I

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.121
THINK PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:21.656
BEST. INTEREST IS THAT THAT WE

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:25.560
FIX PROBLEM WE GET WE THINGS

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:28.730
GOING FOR HER THIRD WORLD THAT.

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:31.399
THAT THE THAT IN TERMS OF THE

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.968
SCHEDULE WHAT I LIKE TO STAY IN

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:38.106
A- TO. KNOW PUT THAT NUMBER IN

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:38.706
REGULAR. CAN GET THROUGH FAST

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:42.543
AS WE CAN. I'M AND THAT WOULD

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:43.111
ALSO INCLUDE A PLAN FORD FOR

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:44.045

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:23.524
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REP THAT IN

WE'LL MAKES IT WILL TAKE

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.774
PROGRESS. IN AND OUT. GOT IT

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:40.408
YEAH AND I'M JUST TO FIGURE OUT

01:34:40.474 --> 01:34:41.008
I KNOW FROM THE COMMITTEE HOW

LEGISLATIVE FIXES IT. RESOURCES

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:43.677
SOUNDS LIKE I'M HER FIGURE OUT

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:44.712
WHY A THIRTEEN YEARS SCHEDULE

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:46.113
HASN'T BEEN UPDATED. AND IT UP.

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:46.614

DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT I'M

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:49.917
TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT. HOW WE

01:34:49.984 --> 01:34:51.552
FIX IT. HOW DO WE GET THERE SO

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:54.221

ULTIMATELY WELL IN TERMS OF THE

01:34:56.891 --> 01:34:57.792
FEET IN TERMS OF THE FEE

01:34:57.858 --> 01:34:59.193
SCHEDULE I THINK OUR

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.361
STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO TALK AND

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:02.163
REACH. AND REACH AN AGREEMENT

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:03.597
OR AT LEAST GET THE PARAMETERS

REASONABLE PAYMENT FOR A

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:10.204
MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATION. BUT

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.172

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:11.972
YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO GET

01:35:12.039 --> 01:35:13.641

REASONABLE MEDICAL EVALUATION.

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:18.846
KNOW WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:21.482
ISSUE THAT'S BEING DECIDED. HOW

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:22.817
SHOULD IT BE BEST DECIDED WHAT

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:25.119
SPECIALTY SHOULD. CANDOR SHOULD

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:27.755

THEY GET TO THAT. PEOPLE

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:30.925

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.796
REPORT. AND THAT GOOD QUALITY

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:37.098
COULD REPORT CAN RESOLVE THE

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:38.966
CASE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:40.468
AT THE PROCESS TO. YOU KNOW THE

01:35:40.534 --> 01:35:43.504
PANEL IS BEING REQUESTED- YOU

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.639
KNOW AVAILABILITY OF Q. ENEMIES

01:35:45.706 --> 01:35:46.674
YOU KNOW EVERY TO HAVE ME ON

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.509
THAT PANEL SHOULD BE AVAILABLE

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:49.944
WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO WE WANT

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:50.678
TO REACH A SOLUTION IN THAT

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:52.580
REGARD. CERTAINLY YEAH I'M

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:53.481
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:54.849
DO THAT LEGISLATIVELY OR

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:55.583
WHETHER YOU'RE DOING IT

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:57.585
INTERNALLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. I

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:58.586
HAVE LEGISLATION THAT KIND OF

01:35:58.652 --> 01:36:02.923
PUSHES TOWARDS. THAT GOAL BUT

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:07.862
I'M. HER FIGURE HOW DO WE HOW

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:08.929
DO WE GET THERE. RIGHT YOU'RE

01:36:08.996 --> 01:36:09.530
SAYING WE HAVE THE STAKEHOLDER

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.598
MEETINGS AND YOU KNOW IS

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:11.165
NOTHING LIKE LEGISLATION TO

01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:11.765
FORCE DISCUSSION. RIGHT WE'VE

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:12.333
SEEN THAT SINCE WE DROP THE

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:13.534
BILL LAST YEAR. THERE'S BEEN A

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:15.236
LOT OF MOVING THE DISCUSSIONS

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:18.339
NOW WHICH I APPRECIATE SEEING-

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:18.939
FROM THE W. C. EVERYONE ELSE.

01:36:19.006 --> 01:36:22.510
BUT. FOR SOME REASON THERE'S

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:23.144
STILL GAP AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:27.314
HOW TO. BRIDGE THAT GAP. WELL I

01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:29.817
COULD CERTAINLY- THAT'S A

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:31.352
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION YOU KNOW

01:36:31.418 --> 01:36:34.054
I WILL CERTAINLY SAY THAT THERE

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:34.989
WAS LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED TO

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:36.724
THINK ABOUT IN OUR SYSTEM IN

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:39.126
THE KILL ME PROCESS GLOBALLY IS

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:40.661
THE PANEL SYSTEM THE BEST WAY

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:41.762
IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS I

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:42.796
MEAN IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET A

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.832
Q. I MEAN FOR AN INJURED WORKER

01:36:44.899 --> 01:36:46.033
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.601
SHOULDN'T HAVE A PANEL SYSTEM

01:36:47.668 --> 01:36:49.170
OF THREE DOCTORS REGION FIVE

01:36:49.236 --> 01:36:49.870
DOCTORS AS THE STATE OUGHT TO

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.805
RECOGNIZE WHY NOT JUST HAVE.

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:53.207
ONE DOCTOR RANDOMLY SELECTED BY

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:55.142
COULD BUY IT BY THE D. W. C.

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:56.343
HERE'S YOUR POSITION YOU NEED

01:36:56.410 --> 01:36:58.479
TO SEE THIS POSITION I MEAN IF

01:36:58.546 --> 01:36:59.813
VOTE SERVE WITHOUT CERTAINLY

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.382
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IT

01:37:01.448 --> 01:37:02.750
SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT I MEAN

01:37:02.816 --> 01:37:03.951
THERE ARE LOTS OF OPTIONS OUT

01:37:04.018 --> 01:37:05.486
THERE I THINK AGAIN WOULD THINK

01:37:05.553 --> 01:37:07.288
WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR STATE OR

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:08.722
STAKEHOLDERS TO GET TOGETHER

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:09.990
AND SAY LOOK THIS IS THE BEST

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:11.592
WAY FOR US I THINK EVERYBODY

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.394
HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:14.628
SURE THAT INJURED WORKERS GET

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.330
BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS

01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:18.165
POSSIBLE. AND I THINK WE REALLY

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.366
NEED TO BE A TAKE THEIR AND

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:20.000
TAKE THEIR CONCERNS INTO

01:37:20.067 --> 01:37:21.902
CONSIDERATION GOT IT LET ME

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:25.272
INVITE THE STATE AUDITOR BACK

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:25.873
UP IF. YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:29.577
THAT JUST BECAUSE. AND THEN AND

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.412
THEN WE'LL MOVED- QUESTIONSBUT

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.046
AS I HAVE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS.

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:32.713
ABOUT THE QUESTION RIVER. GOING

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.014
FROM. IT'S KIND OF PIGGY BACK

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.217
ON YOUR QUESTION. BECAUSE IT'S

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:38.586
SOI'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. IN

01:37:38.652 --> 01:37:40.254
YOUR STATEMENT YOU INDICATED.

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:41.622
AND I IS SPECIFICALLY NAY

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:42.723
DIDN'T COUNT THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.358
THAT YOU SAID IF WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:46.860
RESOURCES. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:48.629
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:49.330
THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:51.966
TWO. YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD DO

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.467
THIS WE SHOULD DO THIS WHAT

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:54.868
DOES IT TAKE OR WHAT IS IT

01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:57.004
GONNA TAKE FROM NOW ON FOR YOU

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:59.273
GUYS TO BE PROACTIVE. AND NOT

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.141
FOR IT TO TAKE AN AUDITED. TO

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:02.476
LOOK AT ALL OF THESE ISSUES

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:03.611
BECAUSE YOU'VE INDICATED THAT

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:04.979
YOU KNEW THESE ISSUES WERE

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:08.082
ALREADY A PROBLEM. AND SO.

01:38:08.148 --> 01:38:09.950
UNTIL LEGISLATION DROPPED OR

01:38:10.017 --> 01:38:12.253
THE AUDIT WAS DROPPED THEN NOW

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:13.220
YOU'RE DOING ALL OF THIS SO

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:14.722
WHAT DOES IT TAKE. BECAUSE THIS

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:15.889
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:17.558
INJURED. AND SOLD TO THE

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:19.393
TIMELINE OUR QUESTION IS. SO

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:21.095
WHAT WOULDN'T SOLVE THIS WOULD

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:23.998
NOT. HAVE HAPPENED. THEN THEN

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.101
WE WOULD BE IN THE SAME. BOAT

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:28.836
SO IT TOOK. LEGISLATION AND IN

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:31.672
ON IT. FOR THIS TO MOVE FORWARD

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:32.840
AND SO WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.775
TO BE PROACTIVE AND FOR US TO

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:37.011
NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS. TO

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.545
FORCE AND I DON'T WANT TO FORCE

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.047
THE DEPARTMENT TO DO ANYTHING

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:41.181
IF THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTUALLY

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:42.249
DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:44.285
BUT WE WERE MOVING FORWARD ON

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:44.952
THE MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE BEFORE

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:47.588
THE AUDIT WAS REQUESTED- SO WE

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:49.089
WERE TAKING STEPS IN THAT

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:51.992
REGARD- AND THEN. AND AS I

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.260
THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THE

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:54.695
PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE BELIEVE

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:55.529
THAT IF THAT IF THAT'S IF

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:57.698
THAT'S MADE- IF THAT. FEE

01:38:57.765 --> 01:38:59.566
SCHEDULE IS UPDATED THAT THAT'S

01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:00.401
GOING TO HOPEFULLY BRING IN

01:39:00.467 --> 01:39:02.403
MORE. WHAT ON THE GATHERED IN

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:03.704
TERMS OF RECRUITMENT WE HAVE

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:05.172
BEEN TALKING AND WE WE'VE

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.640
ALWAYS BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:08.008
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:09.476
TO GET Q. AND NEEDS A LARGE

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.679
MEDICAL GROUPS- BUT THE YOU

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:13.013
KNOW AGAIN. AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:16.016
NOT A MARKETING ARM I KNOW WE

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.251
TALK TO PEOPLE WHICH WE TRY THE

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:19.386
BEST THAT WE CAN. NO AGAIN WE

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.754
RELY ON PRIVATE DOCTORS TO BE

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.890
Q. IT NEEDS. NO I CAN'T BUT I

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:24.291
CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER I CAN

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.893
INCREASE THE POOL. WELL YOU

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:27.361
CAN'T INCREASE THE POOL BUT YOU

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.797
CAN UGH INCREASE THE YOU CAN

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:31.832
ENTICE FOLKS TO DO IT I WAS A

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:33.567
TEACHER. AND WHEN THERE'S A

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.836
LACK OF TEACHERS THERE'S

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:37.971
CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE BEING

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:39.373
DONE IN THE LOOK THE- YOU KNOW

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.874
THE HARD TO FILL- POSITION FOR.

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.976
OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.378
EXAMPLE THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:39:44.445 --> 01:39:45.779
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING

01:39:45.846 --> 01:39:47.481
PLACE TO MAKE SURE TO FILL

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:54.288
THOSE POSITIONS. AND IT I KNOW

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:54.888
YOU'RE WORKING ON IT AGAIN MY

01:39:54.955 --> 01:40:00.394
QUESTION. NOW ON AND WHAT ARE

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:01.662
YOU GOING TO DO- TO BE MORE.

01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:03.397
ACTIVE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:04.031
DO ANOTHER ARE AN AUDITOR MORE

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:05.299
LEGISLATION AND- AS YOU

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.433
INDICATED THAT HAS BEEN GOING

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:07.201
ON SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. WELL

01:40:07.267 --> 01:40:07.835
AS FAR MORE THAN THAN YOU KNOW

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:08.602
AS- WE'VE GOT WE HAVE A STATE

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:09.203
AUDIT WE'VE HAD THE AUDITOR'S

01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:09.903
RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE GOING

01:40:09.970 --> 01:40:10.971
TO. WORK AND WORK ON FILLING

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:12.172
ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:14.908
I AND I WILL AND I WOULD HOPE

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:15.476
THAT THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:17.578
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH. BUT I BUT

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:18.612
I'M GOING TO FIGURE OUT IS THIS

01:40:18.679 --> 01:40:21.148
A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE WHERE WERE

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:22.249
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST YOUR

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:23.584
DEPARTMENT WITH THERE'S BEEN A

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.219
COUPLE OF. OTHER AUDITS WHERE

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:27.121
IT TAKES US TO FORCE THE HAND

01:40:27.187 --> 01:40:28.856
AND I. THINK THAT THAT'S-

01:40:28.922 --> 01:40:30.257
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF THE

01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:32.092
DEPARTMENT OR YOUR DEPARTMENT

01:40:32.159 --> 01:40:33.560
IS REALLY LOOKING AT IT THE

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:34.962
CONVERSATIONS ARE GREAT BUT IF

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:36.029
THERE'S NO ACTION AFTER THE

01:40:36.096 --> 01:40:38.031
CONVERSATIONS. THEN WE HAVE TO

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:40.934
DO THIS BECAUSE I'VE I ACTUALLY

01:40:41.001 --> 01:40:41.735
SPENT TEN YEARS IN HUMAN

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:42.770
RESOURCES DOING WORKERS

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:44.705
COMPENSATION. AND I TALKED

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:47.274
EARLIER ABOUT- THAT I WAS A

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:48.342
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. THESE

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:49.576
ISSUES HAVE BEEN GOING ON SINCE

01:40:49.643 --> 01:40:51.745
I WAS AN HR THEY HAPPEN AND SO.

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:53.814
AND SO I MEAN WE WILL WE WILL

01:40:53.881 --> 01:40:54.948
CERTAINLY WORK THE BEST WE CAN

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:57.551
BUT IN CERTAIN TERMS IT MAYBE

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.920
IT JUST MAY BE A STRUCTURAL

01:40:59.987 --> 01:41:00.521
ISSUE. MAY BE OR DO YOU THINK

01:41:00.587 --> 01:41:04.191
IT IS. I AM IN I'M LOOKING

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.359
RIGHT LOOK I'M NOT GOING TO NO

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:06.560
NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT AND

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:08.095
FRANKLY I REALLY APPRECIATE

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:09.730
THAT IN MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:11.331
IS PROBABLY IT'S A STRUCTURE.

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:12.599
IT'S A STRUCTURAL ISSUE SO THEN

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:13.200
WE MAY NOT WE ORDERED BY THE

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:14.368
DRESS MAYBE WE HAVE SHOULD TAKE

01:41:14.435 --> 01:41:15.502
MAYBE WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP

01:41:15.569 --> 01:41:16.970
BACK AND SAY WHAT IS. YOU KNOW

01:41:17.037 --> 01:41:18.605
IS THIS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO

01:41:18.672 --> 01:41:19.907
MANTA IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO

01:41:19.973 --> 01:41:21.108
ACTUALLY OPERATE THIS. NO

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:22.643
BECAUSE I CAN SO I CAN KEEP

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.144
TRYING TO. YOU KNOW TO FIX FIX

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:25.612
THE FIX A FLAT TIRE THE GRANT

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:26.947
GETTING FLATTER AND FLATTER

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.649
AND- YOU KNOW MY WORK IS GOING

01:41:28.715 --> 01:41:30.317
TO GO FROM FOR BANDAIDS- BUT

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:31.452
BANDAIDS ON THE ACTIONS OF ITS

01:41:31.518 --> 01:41:32.886
A STRUCTURAL ISSUE I WOULD HOPE

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:34.521
THAT AFTER. TODAY THAT WE DON'T

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.857
HAVE TO- PUT LEGISLATION

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:38.358
FORWARD OR OR AN AUDIT FOR

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:39.693
THIS. IN THE AYE WHAT I'M

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:40.861
LOOKING FOR IS FOR IT FOR THE

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.596
DEPARTMENT TO BE MORE PROACTIVE

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:43.730
AND LOOK AT THESE ISSUES BEFORE

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:45.299
WE HAVE TO COME IN AND DO IT.

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.467
RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:47.968
SOMETHING WE NEED TO. I

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.603
ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT AND

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:50.337
I THINK THAT AT SOME POINT IF

01:41:50.404 --> 01:41:53.006
WE SAY LOOK. YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:55.108
TRIED THIS AND IT'S NOT WORKING

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:57.878
WELL THEN WE NEED SOMETHING

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:59.112
ELSE RIGHT AND THE OTHER

01:41:59.179 --> 01:42:01.381
QUESTION THAT. THE PAIN WE HAVE

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:02.883
ENOUGH RESOURCES SO THAT ISSUE

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.218
I WOULD HOPE WOULD GET ADDRESS

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:04.952
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:06.119
RESOURCES THEN WHY ARE WE JUST

01:42:06.186 --> 01:42:06.720
GOING TO DROP IT. BECAUSE WE

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:08.522
HAVE THE RESOURCES IS OUR PLAN.

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:09.490
IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE NO

01:42:09.556 --> 01:42:10.691
RESOURCES NOW WE'RE TO FIX

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:11.859
RIGHT. RIGHT AND THEN AS I

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:14.361
MENTIONED FOR IN TERMS. IN

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:16.096
TERMS OF REVIEWING REPORTS FOR

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.232
QUALITY. KNOW THAT WE DON'T

01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:18.832
HAVE MEANT PROFESSION SO THAT

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.467
WE THINK REACHING OUT COMMUNITY

01:42:20.534 --> 01:42:22.002
FOR FORMER COMMITTEE WERE

01:42:22.069 --> 01:42:22.636
WRITTEN BRING PEOPLE IN TO TAKE

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:24.872
A LOOK AT THEM. WHAT THE HELL.

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.540
SO I THINK WE KNOW WE DO WE DO

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:29.810
ALSO HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:32.279
WHAT WE DO HAVE. AND WHAT

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:37.851

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:52.933
SOMETHING THAT WE- THAT WE'RE

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.201
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW AND I

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:55.536
CAN'T. AND I CAN'T PROVIDE AN

01:42:55.602 --> 01:42:57.471
ANSWER FOR. NO AS I SAY WE HAVE

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.406
AN ONLINE PANEL SYSTEM WHERE WE

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:00.574
WERE THE PARTY REQUESTING A

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:02.442
PANEL GOES ON. NO GOES ON OR

01:43:02.509 --> 01:43:03.777
COMPUTER SYSTEM AND GETS A

ALGORITHMS INVOLVED- AND- AND-

01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:18.225
WE VAST R. I. T. UNIT. FROM THE

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.626
DEPARTMENT TO REALLY TAKE A

01:43:19.693 --> 01:43:21.028

SELECTED. IF THEY'RE NOT. WELL

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.669
THEN WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:30.203
ALGORITHMS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:31.405

IN MY EXAMPLE FROM DOWN IN THE

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.079
DISTRICT WHERE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:39.713
THEY'RE NOT EVEN BEING

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.448

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:44.084
THAT PILL. THAT PULL LARGER.

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:46.353
YOU WOULD. JUST THINK THAT. THE

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:48.622
DELAY TIME WOULD BE A LOT LESS.

RIGHT RIGHT IN THE RIGHT. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:51.124
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT

01:43:51.191 --> 01:43:52.192
THE RESULTS IS BUT THE BOTTOM

01:43:52.259 --> 01:43:53.160
LINE IS THAT WE'VE GOT A

01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:55.128
SHRINKING. SHRINKING BODY OF Q.

FOR PANELS. THERE'S A PROBLEM.

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:03.236
AND SO THAT PROBABLY TO GET

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:05.405
FIXED. CUT OUR- ICE UP MORE

01:44:05.472 --> 01:44:06.673

MEDICAL LEGAL EXPENSES ARE NOT

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:41.408
PAID SO THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:44.478
NOT BE PAID- GOOD SO THERE IS A

01:44:44.544 --> 01:44:45.545

01:47:44.391 --> 01:47:45.525
SHORT FALL ON WHERE THE

01:47:45.592 --> 01:47:48.061
SHORTFALL IS WELL WE SEE THE

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:50.163
NUMBER OF PANEL REQUESTS RISING

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:53.033
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

01:47:53.099 --> 01:47:54.668
PEOPLE REQUEST WE SHOULD HAVE A

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:55.268
COMPETENT. THE COMP NUMBER OF

01:47:55.335 --> 01:47:57.137
Q. AND- YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:58.972
THAT I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD

01:47:59.039 --> 01:48:01.074
NEED MORE IF WE HAVE TWENTY

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:01.641
SEVEN HUNDRED BOY WOULD BE

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:03.243
GREAT IF WE HAD TEN THOUSAND

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:04.578
BUT YOU SEE OUR PROBLEM HERE-

01:48:04.644 --> 01:48:05.745
WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH

01:48:05.812 --> 01:48:08.715
SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT IMPACT.

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.116
OUR WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:11.318
DEPENDING ON WHICH SIDE OF THE

01:48:11.384 --> 01:48:12.886
AISLE YOU ARE I MEAN WE HAVE

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:15.121
DIFFERENT WE TO THESE ISSUES

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.623
FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:19.492
AT THE END OF THE DAY GRETA SO

01:48:19.559 --> 01:48:20.026
WHERE YOU ARE AND- IN THE

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:23.296
CHAMBERS. DOWNSTAIRS YOU'RE-

01:48:23.363 --> 01:48:23.830
MAKING SURE THAT INJURED

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:26.132
WORKERS GET TAKEN CARE OF.

01:48:26.199 --> 01:48:28.835
BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSTITUENTS

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:29.336
MAYBE I CAN ASK CLASSES

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:32.172
QUESTION THIS WAY. OF BECAUSE

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:34.708
WE SAW THAT PANELS QUADRUPLED

01:48:34.774 --> 01:48:37.110
BUT MAYBE HOW MANY KILOMETERS

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:38.778
DO WE NEED TO NOT TRIGGER THE

01:48:38.845 --> 01:48:40.747
SIXTY DAY. WELL I JUST WANNA

01:48:40.814 --> 01:48:41.882

YOU KNOW HOW MANY REPRESENTED

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:47.120
CASES YOU YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:48.955
AND Q. IN ME DECISIONS GO TO

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:50.924
THE VERY HEART OF THE WORKERS

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:52.692
COMP PROCESS WHICH IS THE

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:55.862
INJURY WORK RELATED. WE I DON'T

01:48:55.929 --> 01:48:57.297
KNOW AND WE KNOW HOW MANY Q. IN

01:48:57.364 --> 01:48:58.265
THESE ARE IN YOUR COMPUTER

01:48:58.331 --> 01:49:01.568
SYSTEM. YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:02.135
COMPUTE HOW MANY Q. A MAJOR

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:04.738
NEED. IF THERE'S A DELAY IN

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.406
GETTING Q. AMAZED TO TAKE ON

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:09.209
CASES. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S- FOR

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:10.343
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT MATH

01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:12.746
WHICH IS NOT ME. NOT ME EITHER

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:13.847
IN FORT WE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT.

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:16.383
FIGURE AND THEN FROM THAT WE

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.717
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:18.919
THE PROBLEM AS WELL OBVIOUSLY

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:20.320
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO MY

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:21.321
QUESTION SO I'LL DROP IT BUT

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.657
LET ME AS IS. HAVE WE GONE OUT

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:26.459
TO THE FOLKS WHO USED TO BE Q.

01:49:26.526 --> 01:49:30.163

ASSOCIATION OR OTHERWISE TO

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:35.068
DETERMINE AND ASK THE QUESTION

01:49:35.135 --> 01:49:37.837
WHY. AREN'T PHYSICIANS INDIES

01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:42.742
TEO'S. SIGNING UP TO BE.

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:44.544
QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:45.145
REVISED WAITERS IN OUR WORKERS

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:48.615
COMP SYSTEM. WE HAVEN'T-

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:50.050
DIRECTLY HAD ASKED THAT

01:49:50.116 --> 01:49:51.751
QUESTION BUT WITH THE TIME I

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:53.820
ASK OF PHYSICIANS WHY ARE THEY

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:56.957
NOT Q. IT MEANS THEY COME BACK

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.824
AND SAY WORKERS COMPENSATION IS

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:00.393
TOO COMPLICATED- AND FRANKLY WE

01:50:00.460 --> 01:50:01.795
DON'T WANTED WE DON'T WANT TO

01:50:01.861 --> 01:50:02.896
GO NEAR IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:03.763
THE ONES THAT ARE STILL IN THE

01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:05.832
SYSTEM ONE HIGHER. PAY AND I

01:50:05.899 --> 01:50:07.867
GET THAT AND I AGREE WITH THAT.

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:08.969
BUT THE ONES THAT ARE NOT IN

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.037
THE SYSTEM ARE NOT IN THE

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:11.671
SYSTEM FOR REASON I'M WONDERING

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:14.908
IF IT COULD BE THE. YOU KNOW

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:15.575
MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.344
YOUR STANDARDS YOU KNOW.

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:18.445
LICENSE TO PRACTICE IN

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:19.579
CALIFORNIA WELL THAT'S A GOOD

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:21.247
THING WE WANT THAT. SPEND AT

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.515
LEAST ONE THIRD OF THEIR TIME

01:50:22.582 --> 01:50:23.650
PROVIDING DIRECT MEDICAL

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:25.352
TREATMENT WITH THAT PROBABLY

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:25.885
GOES TO WHETHER YOU CAN BE

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:28.722
RETIRED OR NOT. REPORT

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:30.090
FINANCIAL INTEREST WE DON'T

01:50:30.156 --> 01:50:31.124
WANT CONFLICTS AND TAKE AT

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:32.892
LEAST A TWELVE OUR COURSE AND

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:35.095
WRITING MEDICAL LEGAL REPORTS.

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.463
I DON'T YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME

01:50:36.529 --> 01:50:38.431
WHAT THAT'S INVOLVED. AND PASS

01:50:38.498 --> 01:50:41.234
THE COMPETENCY EXAM. YOU KNOW

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.969
IS IT THE COPPERS HE EXAM THAT

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:45.505
BOTHERS US. OR BOTHERS THEM WHY

01:50:45.572 --> 01:50:47.907
ARE PEOPLE FLUNKING THE

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:48.475
COMPETENCY EXAM IF THEY GET

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:52.078
THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND WE

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:52.979
KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ANY OF

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:55.515
THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT I THINK I

01:50:55.582 --> 01:50:57.183
THINK A GOOD PART OF THAT

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:59.052
REASON IS THAT HEALTH CARE

01:50:59.119 --> 01:51:01.588
PROVIDERS ARE GOOD AT. WRITING

01:51:01.654 --> 01:51:04.290
HEALTH CARE BUT TO PASS THIS

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:07.060
TEST THEY NEED TO KNOW SOME OF

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:08.795
THE RULES AND ROEG'S AROUND

01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.296
WORKERS COMPENSATION CIVIC LAY

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:12.766
AROUND BEING ACCUSED ME. AND

01:51:12.832 --> 01:51:16.202
LESS AND LESS YOU STUDY- FOR

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.837
THIS TEST AND STUDY THOSE RULES

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:21.341
IN RAGS- IT'S DIFFICULT TO PASS

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:24.210
THIS EXAMINATION YEAH AND I

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:24.778
BELIEVE IT'S NOT A CLINICAL

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:26.813
TEST BECAUSE- AND I BELIEVE THE

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:29.582
AUDITOR Là HOT IT TALKS ABOUT.

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:31.184
THREE FACTORS OF WHY YOU

01:51:31.251 --> 01:51:33.253
BELIEVE PHYSICIANS ARE BECOMING

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:33.887
Q. ENEMIES. ARE THOUGHT IT READ

01:51:33.953 --> 01:51:36.823
THAT. WELL THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.958
THING IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND

01:51:39.025 --> 01:51:41.027
THE DIVISION TO TELL US WHY THE

01:51:41.094 --> 01:51:42.862
DIVISION THINKS THAT. FOLKS ARE

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:45.165
BECOMING Q. AMIS BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.499
THE ON THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:51:46.566 --> 01:51:47.500
MAKING SURE WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:49.969
SUPPLY AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR

01:51:50.036 --> 01:51:51.104
WORKERS COMP SYSTEM FUNCTIONS

01:51:51.171 --> 01:51:53.306
APPROPRIATELY. YEAH IT IS I

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:54.874
THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED- YOU

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:57.177
KNOW THE EFFECT OF THE PRACTICE

01:51:57.243 --> 01:51:58.611
OF MEDICINE HAS CHANGED OVER

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:03.083
THE LAST. FEW YEARS CAN I GET

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:04.084
THAT THAT AND I CAN I THINK I

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:04.651
THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:52:04.717 --> 01:52:05.185
THAT'S A BIG REASON AND I

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:05.885
UNDERSTAND THAT THE MULTI

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:06.820
SPECIALTY PRACTICE GROUPS

01:52:06.886 --> 01:52:09.089

REVIEWING REPORTS AND WRITING

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:27.107
ANOTHER REPORT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

01:52:27.173 --> 01:52:28.374
COMPLICATED ENOUGH BUT I HAVE

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:29.876

SAUSAGE MAKING MACHINE. AND

02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:57.243
MANY TIMES THE WORKERS ARE NOT

SERVE CORRECTLY I MEAN THIS IS

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:01.447
THE WAY IT IS AND MANY TIMES

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:03.482
THE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT SERVE

02:02:03.549 --> 02:02:05.418
CORRECTLY BECAUSE OF THE

02:02:05.484 --> 02:02:08.120
LITIGATION SYSTEM. SO HERE'S MY

02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:13.225
SILLY IDEA. WHAT IF WE

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:16.295
ESTABLISHED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

02:02:16.362 --> 02:02:18.097
WORKERS COMP CLAIM AND NOW I'M

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:20.900
JUST MAKING THIS UP FIVE

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:23.569
THOUSAND DOLLARS OKAY THAT GOES

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:27.173
TO GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE. MANY

02:02:27.239 --> 02:02:30.976
MOST THEM PLEASE HAVE GROUP

02:02:31.043 --> 02:02:32.078
HEALTH INSURANCE IF WE HAD A

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:35.681
CONDUIT TO BY PASS THE SMALL

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:37.516
WORKERS COMP CLAIMS IT JUST

02:02:37.583 --> 02:02:39.952

HEALTH INSURANCE PAY FOR IT.

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.959
YOU'RE OUT OF THE SYSTEM ONE

02:02:47.026 --> 02:02:48.828
FOR FIVE GRAND- BELOW TRUST ME

02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:50.229
THAT WOULD SAVE IN MY

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:51.397
ESTIMATION ONCE AGAIN I'M

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:54.600
MAKING THINGS UP 47% OF WORKERS

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:56.769
COMP PREMIUMS. JUST BY

02:02:56.836 --> 02:02:57.737
FUNNELING IT OFF THE HEALTH

02:02:57.803 --> 02:03:00.906

IS DESIGNED FOR THE SMALL

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:04.910
CLAIMS ANYWAY THAT'S MY COMMENT

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:06.078
ON DONE THINK YEAH I THINK

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:08.047
THERE'S MIGHT BE A MODEL I WAS

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.749
LOOKING AT IN FRESNO THAT

02:03:09.815 --> 02:03:12.084
KINDA. DOES THAT IT SENDS

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:13.385
INJURED WORKERS TO GO GET

02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:15.387
TREATMENT. AND THEN THEY FIGURE

02:03:15.454 --> 02:03:16.622
OUT THE WORKERS COMP CLAIM ON

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:17.690
THE BACK END BUT THEY FOUND IT

02:03:17.757 --> 02:03:20.292
ACTUALLY SAVED MONEY TO THE

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.861
ENTIRE SYSTEM AND I GOT WORKERS

02:03:21.927 --> 02:03:23.929
TO WORK QUICKER WHICH THEN YOU

02:03:23.996 --> 02:03:26.832
KNOW ALLEVIATE A LOT OF- THE

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:29.001
FRUSTRATIONS. WITH PEOPLE THAT

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:30.069
WERE INJURED I THINK THEY DID

02:03:30.136 --> 02:03:33.005
IT WITH PUBLIC SAFETY- SENATOR

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:35.608
ROBB WHICH IS ONE QUESTION ON

02:03:35.674 --> 02:03:38.277
THE PANELISTS. YOU KNOW WHEN I

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.545
USED TO DO LABOR WORK LABOR

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:41.881
MANAGEMENT WORK AND WE'D-

02:03:41.947 --> 02:03:45.117
SOLICITOR PANELS OF ARBITRATORS

02:03:45.184 --> 02:03:45.718
OR MEDIATORS FOR THAT FOR THAT

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:48.821
MATTER FROM THE NATIONAL

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:51.557
SERVICES WOULD GET A PANEL OF

02:03:51.624 --> 02:03:53.025
TEN TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE. AND IT

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:54.660
WAS A STRIKE SITUATION AS WELL

02:03:54.727 --> 02:03:55.828
ONE SIDE WOULD STRIKE THE OTHER

02:03:55.895 --> 02:03:57.496
WHICH STRIKE INTO WE AGREED TO

02:03:57.563 --> 02:04:01.500
A PARTICULAR PERSON. I KNOW

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:02.701
YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT YOUR

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:04.537
PANEL IS THERE ANY LEGISLATIVE

02:04:04.603 --> 02:04:06.505
OR A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:08.340
RESTRICTION ON THE NOT BUILD

02:04:08.407 --> 02:04:09.775
THE SIZE OF YOUR PANEL THAT YOU

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:11.010
SEND OUT TO PEOPLE IN THE

02:04:11.076 --> 02:04:12.945
WORKERS COMPRESSES I THINK IN

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:14.947
STATUTES REQUIRED TO BE THREE.

02:04:15.014 --> 02:04:16.282
OKAY SO THAT TO ENSURE THE

02:04:16.348 --> 02:04:17.783
CHAIRS QUESTION THAT IS

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:18.417
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:19.518
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED NUMBER

02:04:19.585 --> 02:04:22.188
ONE. AND NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:23.789
IS THERE ARE. IS THERE ANYTHING

02:04:23.856 --> 02:04:24.723
IN THE STATUTE OF THE

02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:26.859
REGULATION THAT LIMITS

02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:30.229
GEOGRAPHICALLY THE LOCATION OF

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:32.231
pTHE HUMAN MAYES THAT ARE LISTED

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:34.366
ON THE PANEL. SHEET THAT'S

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:35.868
GIVEN TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN

02:04:35.935 --> 02:04:38.237
THE PROCESS I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:39.104
I DON'T ELIEVE THAT I DON'T

02:04:39.171 --> 02:04:39.972
BELIEVE IT'S AN STATURE AND

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:41.740
THEN THE ONLY ISSUE THEN I

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:44.243
ASSUME WOULD BE THE FACT THAT

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.011
THE INJURED WORKER WE- MIGHT

02:04:46.078 --> 02:04:47.413
NEED TO TRANSPORT HIMSELF OR

02:04:47.479 --> 02:04:49.114
HERSELF TO THE QUEUE IN THESE

02:04:49.181 --> 02:04:51.150
OFFICE. TO THE EXTENT THAT IN

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:54.653
AN IN OFFICE EVALUATION IS.

02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.121
NECESSARY REQUIRED IN THAT

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:58.958
CIRCUMSTANCE. AND I ASSUME.

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:00.626
THAT INJURED WORKERS IN THE

02:05:00.693 --> 02:05:02.294
TYPICAL CASE WHERE THE CLAIMS

02:05:02.361 --> 02:05:03.629
BEEN ACCEPTED WILL BE WOULD BE

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:06.031
COMPENSATED FOR THAT TRANSPORT.

02:05:06.098 --> 02:05:08.000
BUT IN A CASE WHERE WORK REAL

02:05:08.067 --> 02:05:08.701
THE WORK RELATEDNESS OF THE

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:11.403
INJURY IS AT ISSUE. IS THE

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:12.605
EMPLOYEE ENTITLED TO

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:15.074
COMPENSATION. FOR THAT INITIAL

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:18.277
Q. IN THE VISIT. MILEAGE

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:20.279
COMPENSATION BY I'D I'D I'D

02:05:20.346 --> 02:05:21.213
HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT I AM NOT

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:23.015
SURE OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD SO I

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:25.050
BUT THAT'S- OBVIOUSLY A STATUTE

02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:26.318
OR REGULATORY GRAPHICS IF

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:29.088
NECESSARY RIGHT AT THE CHAIR

02:05:29.154 --> 02:05:29.688
IN. IN HIS EFFORTS WOULD NEED

02:05:29.755 --> 02:05:31.557
TO TAKE A LOOK AT AS WELL.

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:32.157
PERFECT THANK YOU MISTER THANK

02:05:32.224 --> 02:05:36.328

02:05:36.395 --> 02:05:37.630
TOUCH ON TWO MORE THINGS LOS

02:05:37.696 --> 02:05:38.864
THE AUDITOR WANTS TO CHIME IN

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:41.100
ON ANYTHING OKAY ONLY BECAUSE

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:42.234
OF THE WAY THINGS ARE BROUGHT

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:43.736
UP EARLIER THAT WE REALLY

02:05:43.802 --> 02:05:44.503
HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON AND THAT'S

02:05:44.570 --> 02:05:47.473
THE DUE PROCESS. FOR FOLKS THAT

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:50.409
I HAVE- NOT BEEN RESTORED IS IT

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:51.310
RECERTIFIED TO RE APPROVED

02:05:51.377 --> 02:05:53.512
POINTED REAPPOINTED SO HE TALK

02:05:53.579 --> 02:05:58.117
ABOUT THAT AND WHAT'S THE- WHAT

02:05:58.183 --> 02:05:59.752
IS OUR DUE PROCESS WHAT CAN

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:00.352
THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK. THE

02:06:00.419 --> 02:06:01.720
AUDITOR IN HER STATEMENT

02:06:01.787 --> 02:06:03.389
EARLIER HAD TALKED ABOUT SO

02:06:03.455 --> 02:06:05.624
MANY. SO MANY REPORTS WERE RAD

02:06:05.691 --> 02:06:07.393
THEY WENT THROUGH LIKE EIGHTY

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:07.927
SIX BUT THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW

02:06:07.993 --> 02:06:08.294
THROUGH WITH THE

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.362
RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU JUST TALK

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:11.463
TO US ABOUT THAT AND WHAT

02:06:11.530 --> 02:06:13.132
HAPPENED AND WHY AREN'T WE-

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:14.967
FIGURE OUT A- BETTER SYSTEM FOR

02:06:15.034 --> 02:06:16.368
THAT. WELL OUR FOR TALKING

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.137
ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE I AM I

02:06:18.203 --> 02:06:19.238
THINK WE ARE WE HAVE REACHED A

02:06:19.305 --> 02:06:21.307
BETTER SYSTEM FOR THAT I THINK

02:06:21.373 --> 02:06:22.541
OF SOME OF THE DUE PROCESS

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:25.044

SIXTEEN- BUT I WE'VE WE'VE

02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:46.498

RIGHT NOW- THAT'S THE TITLE

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:01.780
TRACK THAT'S A DUAL TRACK OF

02:07:01.847 --> 02:07:03.215
THE AUDIT AND THE AUDITOR HAS

02:07:03.282 --> 02:07:04.650
ASKED US TO PUT DOWN THOSE

IN THE NUMBER OF CARE MAYES HAS

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:16.287
OCCURRED. BUT THAT DECREASE IS

02:23:16.354 --> 02:23:17.956
DUE TO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS

02:23:18.022 --> 02:23:20.625
IT'S NOT JUST LOW PAY.

02:23:20.692 --> 02:23:22.160

VOLUNTARILY DID NOT REVIEW WE

02:23:38.843 --> 02:23:39.944
KNEW THERE CAN BE

02:23:40.011 --> 02:23:42.146
CERTIFICATIONS. AND MORE THAN

02:23:42.213 --> 02:23:44.048
HALF OF THOSE PHYSICIANS WERE

02:23:44.115 --> 02:23:45.917
NOT ACTIVELY PERFORMING CURE ME

02:23:45.984 --> 02:23:48.953
EVALUATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.888

02:23:56.494 --> 02:24:00.098
QUALITY OF THEIR REPORTS. IT IS

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:00.631
THE INAUGURAL BALL IN ARE

02:24:00.698 --> 02:24:04.102
CURABLE GOAL. OF ALL SIDES

02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:06.771
PAYERS INJURED WORKERS CAN AMIR

02:24:06.838 --> 02:24:08.773
PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE A QUALITY

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:11.809
FIRST REPORT. BUT THE NUMBER OF

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:13.511
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS THAT ARE

02:24:13.578 --> 02:24:15.747
ISSUED BY EVALUATORS HIGHLIGHTS

02:24:15.813 --> 02:24:17.448
THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM

02:24:17.515 --> 02:24:21.519
AS IT PRESENTLY EXISTS. LOOKING

02:24:21.586 --> 02:24:23.287
NEXT TO A REASON FOR THE DELAYS

02:24:23.354 --> 02:24:24.956
IN THE KILL ME APPOINTMENTS THE

02:24:25.023 --> 02:24:26.424
DATA POINT TO A NUMBER OF

02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:28.359
OFFICES. THAT EACH PROVIDER

02:24:28.426 --> 02:24:31.829
OPERATES FROM. YEARS AGO A FEW

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:33.765
PROVIDERS WERE OPERATING OUT OF

02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:34.632
MORE THAN A DOZEN OFFICES

02:24:34.699 --> 02:24:36.601
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH THE

02:24:36.667 --> 02:24:38.036
RESULT THAT DOES PHYSICIANS

02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:40.038
REPLACED ON Q. ANY PANELS MORE

02:24:40.104 --> 02:24:41.539
OFTEN THAN PHYSICIANS WHO

02:24:41.606 --> 02:24:44.042
OPERATED OUT OF A SINGLE OFFICE.

02:24:44.108 --> 02:24:45.543
SO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE LAW

02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:48.079
CHANGED TO LIMIT TO TEN. THE

02:24:48.146 --> 02:24:49.480
NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT EACH

02:24:49.547 --> 02:24:50.581
PROVIDER WOULD BE PERMITTED TO

02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:53.484
UTILIZE. BUT THE RESULT WAS

02:24:53.551 --> 02:24:55.186
THAT MORE PROVIDERS STARTED

02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:57.188
USING MULTIPLE OFFICES AND

02:24:57.255 --> 02:24:59.190
SENSE ONE PHYSICIAN CAN STILL

02:24:59.257 --> 02:25:01.059
WORK ONLY SO MANY HOURS IN A

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:02.527
WEEK NO MATTER HOW MANY OFFICES

02:25:02.593 --> 02:25:04.829
THEY HAVE. THOSE PROVIDERS

02:25:04.896 --> 02:25:06.564
APPOINTMENT CALENDARS STARTED

02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:08.332
TO FILL UP FASTER. THAN EVER

02:25:08.399 --> 02:25:10.968
BEFORE. THAT CAUSED THE SYSTEM

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:12.703
TO BE UNABLE TO MEET THE SIXTY

02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:14.172
DAY DEADLINE TO SET AN

02:25:14.238 --> 02:25:16.174
APPOINTMENT. WHICH IN TURN

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:18.476
RESULTED IN AN INCREASED NUMBER

02:25:18.543 --> 02:25:19.043
OF REQUESTS FOR REPLACEMENT

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:23.448
PANELS. LASTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:25:23.514 --> 02:25:24.082
ADDRESS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

02:25:24.148 --> 02:25:26.084
THE AUDITOR IN HER REPORT. THE

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.618
AUDITOR'S FIRST RECOMMENDATION

02:25:27.685 --> 02:25:28.653
IS THAT THE MED LEGAL FEE

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:29.987
SCHEDULE BE REVIEWED AND

02:25:30.054 --> 02:25:31.389
UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY TWO

02:25:31.456 --> 02:25:33.091
YEARS IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE

02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:34.926
LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THAT ANY

02:25:34.992 --> 02:25:36.727
MANDATE TO UPDATE TO THE

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:37.695
MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE

02:25:37.762 --> 02:25:39.730
WOULD MEAN MODIFYING THE CODES

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:41.966
AND THE RULES. AND THAT WOULD

02:25:42.033 --> 02:25:43.468
INVOKE THE FULL REGULATORY

02:25:43.534 --> 02:25:45.703
PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT

02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:48.039
THE AUDITOR INTENDED TO SUGGEST

02:25:48.106 --> 02:25:49.407
THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES BE

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:52.110
UPDATED. TO THIS SENSITIVITY

02:25:52.176 --> 02:25:53.411
AYE RECOMMENDS THAT THE MEDICAL

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:54.745
LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE RATES BE

02:25:54.812 --> 02:25:57.048
TIED DIRECTLY TO A VALID

02:25:57.115 --> 02:25:59.183
INFLATION INDEX SUCH AS THE

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:00.852
MEDICARE ECONOMIC INDEX

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:03.054
REFERENCED BY MR PERSONAS WALL.

02:26:03.121 --> 02:26:04.322
THISWOULD OF FACILITATE

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:06.457
REGULAR UPDATES THE ME I HAS

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:07.992
ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED BY THE

02:26:08.059 --> 02:26:10.161
DATE OF YOU SEE AS A MEANS OF

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:12.597
MAKING THEIR ANNUAL UPDATES. TO

02:26:12.663 --> 02:26:13.431
THE CONVERSION FACTOR FOR

02:26:13.498 --> 02:26:16.300
PHYSICIAN IN OPPOSITION-

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:16.868
SERVICES. UNDER THE OFFICIAL

02:26:16.934 --> 02:26:18.970
MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE. THE

02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:20.638
AUDITOR HAS FURTHER SUGGESTED

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:22.406
THAT THE DELAYS CAUSED BY

02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:23.808
REPLACEMENT PANELS COULD BE

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:25.776
REDUCED. BY INCREASING THE

02:26:25.843 --> 02:26:27.011
NUMBER OF KILOMETERS ON THE

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:29.480
PANELS FROM THREE TO FIVE IN

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:31.883
REPRESENTED CASES. AS REFLECTED

02:26:31.949 --> 02:26:33.317
IN THE SEA TO BE SEE I REPORT

02:26:33.384 --> 02:26:35.052
IN FRONT OF YOU. THERE SIMPLY

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:37.555
WILL NOT BE FIVE Q. M. IS

02:26:37.622 --> 02:26:38.890
AVAILABLE IN ANY BUT A FEW

02:26:38.956 --> 02:26:41.225
SPECIALTIES. GIVEN THE CURRENT

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:42.994
POPULATION OF KIMI PROVIDERS

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:45.596
THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF

02:26:45.663 --> 02:26:47.031
GETTING FIVE PROVIDERS IN MOST

02:26:47.098 --> 02:26:49.367
SPECIALTIES. OUR STUDY CONFIRMS

02:26:49.433 --> 02:26:51.335
THAT ACCESS TO Q. ARMIES IN THE

02:26:51.402 --> 02:26:53.404
SYSTEM IS ALREADY GREATLY

02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:55.239
IMPACTED BY LOCATION AND

02:26:55.306 --> 02:26:57.141
REQUESTED SPECIALTY. THE

02:26:57.208 --> 02:26:58.943
PROPOSED CHANGE MAY RESULT IN

02:26:59.010 --> 02:27:00.711
EVEN LARGER GEOGRAPHIC SEARCHES

02:27:00.778 --> 02:27:01.946
BY THE DUE TO BE SEE IN ORDER

02:27:02.013 --> 02:27:04.282
TO GENERATE A FULL PANEL

02:27:04.348 --> 02:27:04.882
PERHAPS HALF THE STATE IN SOME

02:27:04.949 --> 02:27:07.451
INSTANCES. ONE FINAL

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:10.121
RECOMMENDATION. A PLAN TO

02:27:10.188 --> 02:27:10.788
ADJUST THE MED LEGAL FEE

02:27:10.855 --> 02:27:13.090

CONSISTS OF A 30% INCREASE OR A

02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:18.663
50% INCREASE TO THE

02:27:18.729 --> 02:27:20.231
REIMBURSEMENT RATE. IT MUST

02:27:20.298 --> 02:27:21.632
ENCOMPASS A CHANGE TO THE

02:27:21.699 --> 02:27:23.901
OVERALL CURE ME PROCESS THAT

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:26.737

GETS ONE OF THOSE EVALUATIONS

02:32:03.547 --> 02:32:05.082

MAKE THE GAME THE SYSTEM. AND

02:32:10.187 --> 02:32:11.222
WITH THE D. W. C. DID WAS

02:32:11.288 --> 02:32:14.291
IGNORE THE FACT THAT. THAT THAT

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:16.160
MANY EVALUATIONS PAID THIS

02:32:16.227 --> 02:32:17.561
INCREDIBLY LOW RATE AND THEY

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:19.330
TRY TO INVESTIGATE PEOPLE WHO

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:21.065
THEY THOUGHT WERE CHARGING TOO

02:32:21.131 --> 02:32:23.634
MUCH. WIRE QB'S IMPORTANT ONE

02:32:23.701 --> 02:32:25.803
EXAMPLE- I RECENTLY EVALUATED

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.204

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:21.278
REASON THAT SO MANY Q. AMIS DO

02:35:21.345 --> 02:35:22.880
NOT RECEIVE EVALUATIONS IS

02:35:22.946 --> 02:35:24.081
BECAUSE THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:26.950
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE DEMAND

02:35:27.017 --> 02:35:28.352
FOR Q. ME SERVICES ON A

ORTHOPEDIST'S ORTHOPEDIST'S ARE

02:35:47.871 --> 02:35:50.207

RELATIVE TO THEIR DEMAND THERE

02:35:58.716 --> 02:35:59.917
IS NO TWEAKING TO THE ALGORITHM

02:35:59.983 --> 02:36:01.518
THAT WILL GIVE UNDER UTILIZED

02:36:01.585 --> 02:36:04.455
PSYCHOLOGISTS MORE WORK THERE

02:36:04.521 --> 02:36:05.055
SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH DEMAND FOR

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:09.026

THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS AND

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:26.857
WOULD REQUIRE. THAT TWC UPDATE

02:39:26.924 --> 02:39:28.358
THE FEE SCHEDULE FOR INFLATION

02:39:28.425 --> 02:39:30.093
GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT

THE CURRENT SITUATION NEVER

INSTEAD ONLY BILL A FLAT FEE.

02:39:54.851 --> 02:39:56.353
WE SURVEYED THE COMMUNITY THE

02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:58.755
QUEUE ANY COMMUNITY AND FOUND

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:00.123

REDUCED THEIR QUEUE ME PRACTICE.

02:40:10.167 --> 02:40:11.601
THE PROPOSED FEE SCHEDULE IS

02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:12.803
BASED ON THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE

02:40:12.869 --> 02:40:15.205
SCHEDULE OF NEVADA HOWEVER THE

02:40:15.272 --> 02:40:17.574
FEES WHICH TWC HAS SUGGESTED

02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:20.911
ARE 62% LESS THAN THOSE ALLOWED

02:40:20.978 --> 02:40:22.913
FOR IN NEVADA. THIS IS ODD

02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.614
GIVEN THAT CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH

02:55:47.803 --> 02:55:48.337
IS REQUIRED FOR THE HOW MUCH

02:55:48.404 --> 02:55:50.873
MONEY IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE

02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:52.041
THAT WE HAVE ONCOLOGISTS IN

02:55:52.108 --> 02:55:54.310
INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALISTS

02:55:54.377 --> 02:55:55.611
IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF

02:55:55.678 --> 02:55:57.713
ORTHOPEDIST'S. ANALYSTS AROUND

02:55:57.780 --> 02:55:59.048
THE STATE SO WE CAN HAVE

02:55:59.115 --> 02:56:01.284
INJURED WORKERS PARTICULARLY

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:03.352
WHERE THE ISSUE IS WHETHER IS

02:56:03.419 --> 02:56:04.120
WHETHER THERE THERE IS WORK

02:56:04.186 --> 02:56:06.455
RELATED THIS. TO THE PARTICULAR

02:56:06.522 --> 02:56:08.658
CASE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S MY

02:56:08.724 --> 02:56:09.659
UNDERSTANDING THAT PROCESS

02:56:09.725 --> 02:56:10.593
DOESN'T BEGIN CLAIMS

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:11.928
ADMINISTRATORS ARE NOT

02:56:11.994 --> 02:56:13.162
PERMITTED TO PROCEED UNTIL THAT

02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:15.698
ISSUE IS DECIDED. AND SO IF I

02:56:15.765 --> 02:56:17.400
DON'T HAVE AN ONCOLOGIST- I

02:56:17.466 --> 02:56:18.567
DON'T HAVE AN INSPECTION

02:56:18.634 --> 02:56:19.568
INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALISTS

02:56:19.635 --> 02:56:23.105
OR AN ORTHOPEDIST TO MAKE THAT

02:56:23.172 --> 02:56:25.241
DETERMINATION THEN WHAT HAPPENS.

02:56:25.308 --> 02:56:27.276
SO I HAVEN'T HEARD AN ANSWER TO

02:56:27.343 --> 02:56:29.679
THAT HERE. I'M HOPING AT SOME

02:56:29.745 --> 02:56:31.147
POINT I'LL HEAR AN ANSWER I'M

02:56:31.213 --> 02:56:32.548
YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT A SUPPORTER

02:56:32.615 --> 02:56:34.350
IN TERMS OF FEE INCREASES BUT

02:56:34.417 --> 02:56:36.519
I'M JUST NOT. THE DOT STARK

02:56:36.585 --> 02:56:39.088
BEING AREN'T CONNECTED SO IF WE

02:56:39.155 --> 02:56:41.390
APPROVE A 50% FEE INCREASES

02:56:41.457 --> 02:56:43.559
SUING WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

02:56:43.626 --> 02:56:44.160
DO SO OR GOING TO BE BACK HERE

02:56:44.226 --> 02:56:46.362
IN TWELVE MONTHS. HAVING PEOPLE

02:56:46.429 --> 02:56:47.930
TALK TO US ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:56:47.997 --> 02:56:48.898
THEY'RE IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS

02:56:48.965 --> 02:56:50.766
OF Q. IN THESE ON THE PANEL.

02:56:50.833 --> 02:56:53.302
THE THEY ARE UNAVAILABLE. CAN

02:56:53.369 --> 02:56:55.071
SOMEBODY RESPOND TO THAT.

02:56:55.137 --> 02:56:57.773
SENATE ROTH I CERTAINLY CAN THE

02:56:57.840 --> 02:56:59.809
FEE INCREASE IS GREAT IT WILL

02:56:59.875 --> 02:57:01.711
HELP IT WILL HELP THOSE.

02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:03.746
DOCTORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY

02:57:03.813 --> 02:57:05.648
PROVIDING SERVICE FOR SURE ARE

02:57:05.715 --> 02:57:06.983
CURRENTLY PROVIDING AND WHO

02:57:07.049 --> 02:57:08.384
HAVE STAYED OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM

02:57:08.451 --> 02:57:10.586
BECAUSE OF THE FEE ISSUE. BUT

02:57:10.653 --> 02:57:12.254
IS MISSED PERSONA REFERENCE TO

02:57:12.321 --> 02:57:14.590
HAS OUR REPORT ALSO REFERENCES.

02:57:14.657 --> 02:57:16.325
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY

02:57:16.392 --> 02:57:17.893
INCREASE THE FEES AND NOT THAT

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:19.929
MUCH HAPPENED. THE ANSWER TO

02:57:19.996 --> 02:57:21.764
YOUR QUESTION IS PARTLY

02:57:21.831 --> 02:57:24.166
INCREASE THE FEES BUT TO SOLVE

02:57:24.233 --> 02:57:25.868
THE PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK

02:57:25.935 --> 02:57:27.503
ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM CAN SOLVE

02:57:27.570 --> 02:57:28.571
THE PROBLEM IN IN IN FIVE

02:57:28.637 --> 02:57:31.040
MINUTES MUCH LESS AN HOUR- I

02:57:31.107 --> 02:57:32.508
CAN TELL YOU. WE'VE BEEN

02:57:32.575 --> 02:57:33.542
WORKING ON FOR A LONG TIME

02:57:33.609 --> 02:57:34.777
KIMBERLY AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT

02:57:34.844 --> 02:57:37.346
SO THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

02:57:37.413 --> 02:57:38.748
SYSTEM IS WHAT KEEPS DOCTORS

02:57:38.814 --> 02:57:41.150
OUT ITS WHAT. FRUSTRATES THE

02:57:41.217 --> 02:57:43.185
EMPLOYERS IT'S WHAT FRUSTRATES

02:57:43.252 --> 02:57:44.253
THE CARRIERS IT'S WHAT

02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:46.022
FRUSTRATES THE INJURED WORKERS.

02:57:46.088 --> 02:57:48.090
THE SYSTEM IS OVERLY COMPLEX

02:57:48.157 --> 02:57:49.525
WHEN THE GRAND BARGAIN WAS

02:57:49.592 --> 02:57:52.395
FIRST- INITIATED. THE WORKERS

02:57:52.461 --> 02:57:53.629
COMPENSATIONRULES COULD BE

02:57:53.696 --> 02:57:55.731
CONTAINED IN A PAMPHLET IT IS

02:57:55.798 --> 02:57:57.533
NOW OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS BUT

02:57:57.600 --> 02:57:59.201
COVERS OF THE RULES AND

02:57:59.268 --> 02:58:01.170
REGULATIONS AND STATUTES FOR

02:58:01.237 --> 02:58:02.605
WORKERS COMPENSATION WILL TELL

02:58:02.671 --> 02:58:03.906
YOU FROM AN ATTORNEY STANDPOINT

02:58:03.973 --> 02:58:07.810
USED TO HAVE TO DO. REPORTS FOR

02:58:07.877 --> 02:58:10.613
WHICH I WOULD WAS PAID I WOULD

02:58:10.679 --> 02:58:12.281
MUCH RATHER. BE ABLE TO ANSWER

02:58:12.348 --> 02:58:13.883
THE QUESTION ABOUT THE REPORT

02:58:13.949 --> 02:58:15.317
THAN TO GET A LETTER WITH MY

02:58:15.384 --> 02:58:16.685
REPORT THE TELLS ME TO DO

02:58:16.752 --> 02:58:18.654
ANOTHER REPORT. FOR WHICH I'M

02:58:18.721 --> 02:58:20.056
NOT GETTING ADEQUATELY PAY I

02:58:20.122 --> 02:58:22.091
MEAN I CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT

02:58:22.158 --> 02:58:23.492
YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A LOT OF

02:58:23.559 --> 02:58:25.394
BUREAUCRATIC MUMBO JUMBO THAT

02:58:25.461 --> 02:58:27.863
WE BUILT INTO THIS PROCESS. IT

02:58:27.930 --> 02:58:29.899
PROBABLY DOES DISSUADE PEOPLE

02:58:29.965 --> 02:58:32.001
FROM PARTICIPATING IN PROVIDING

02:58:32.068 --> 02:58:34.737
BADLY NEEDED. MEDICAL SERVICES

02:58:34.804 --> 02:58:36.672
TO INJURED WORKERS TO GET THEIR

02:58:36.739 --> 02:58:38.941
CLAIM MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

02:58:39.008 --> 02:58:39.975
AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT

02:58:40.042 --> 02:58:41.811
POINT AND BUT WE HAVE YET TO

02:58:41.877 --> 02:58:43.145
HEAR FROM THE W. C. WHOSE

02:58:43.212 --> 02:58:44.713
MISSION STATEMENT HAD HAS BEEN

02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:46.715
FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS TO.

02:58:46.782 --> 02:58:48.150
DO ANYTHING ON THE LINES TO

02:58:48.217 --> 02:58:48.818
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

02:58:48.884 --> 02:58:50.953
SPECIFICALLY SARAH. I DON'T

02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:52.788
KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBERS. I

02:58:52.855 --> 02:58:54.657
PASSED MY CLIENTS I SAID. WHAT

02:58:54.723 --> 02:58:56.325
DO YOU NEED. THE BIGGEST THING

02:58:56.392 --> 02:58:57.927
HE SAID AS THEY NEED TO BE LEFT

02:58:57.993 --> 02:58:59.829
ALONE SO THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK

02:58:59.895 --> 02:59:00.596
AND READ THE REPORTS WITHOUT

02:59:00.663 --> 02:59:03.933
BEING HOUSEHOLD. AND HE SAID

02:59:03.999 --> 02:59:04.533
I'M PROBABLY OKAY IF I MEDICAL

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:06.936
RATE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX

02:59:07.002 --> 02:59:10.172
IF THEY WERE THERE. BUT THAT'S

02:59:10.239 --> 02:59:10.773
YOUR CLIENTS THAT ARE IN THE

02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:12.942
SYSTEM NO SOME OF THEM LEFT I

02:59:13.008 --> 02:59:14.977
HAVE AN ORTHOPEDIC WHO WHO

02:59:15.044 --> 02:59:16.212
SIGNED UP BUT DIDNT AND SAID

02:59:16.278 --> 02:59:17.947
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'M NOT

02:59:18.013 --> 02:59:22.718
IN. WHY I GET HASSLED. FORTY

02:59:22.785 --> 02:59:23.285
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MY

02:59:23.352 --> 02:59:23.886
BUSINESS AND IF THOSE RATES I

02:59:23.953 --> 02:59:25.254
DON'T NEED TO DO I. LOOK AT

02:59:25.321 --> 02:59:26.789
THEIR FINANCIAL SPENDING THE

02:59:26.856 --> 02:59:27.823
CARRIERS UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL

02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:29.592
MARKETS BETTER THAN ALL OF US.

02:59:29.658 --> 02:59:30.926
YOU PAY ENOUGH MONEY PEOPLE

02:59:30.993 --> 02:59:34.130
WILL COME SO MAYBE THE POINT IS

02:59:34.196 --> 02:59:34.630

02:59:43.572 --> 02:59:45.207
KNOW WHAT WILL OUR PROSAUROPOD

02:59:45.274 --> 02:59:46.408

WELL OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE.

03:12:41.650 --> 03:12:43.051
THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW

03:12:43.118 --> 03:12:44.286

03:12:44.352 --> 03:12:46.054
A FLAT RATE. NO BECAUSE REALLY

03:12:46.121 --> 03:12:48.023
JUST DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU KNOW

WHAT WHAT DISPUTE IS BEING

03:12:49.457 --> 03:12:50.625

03:12:50.692 --> 03:12:52.327
SPECIALTY TO THE ACTUALLY RIVER

03:12:52.394 --> 03:12:54.229
IS NEEDED TO RESOLVE THAT KIND

03:12:54.296 --> 03:12:56.898
OF DISPUTE- I THINK A FLAT RATE

03:12:56.965 --> 03:12:59.367
IS WOULD HELP PEOPLE BECAUSE-

03:12:59.434 --> 03:13:01.836
NOTE. THERE KNOW WHAT. PLAYERS

03:13:01.903 --> 03:13:03.438
KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY AND

03:13:03.505 --> 03:13:04.039
THEY KNOW WHAT PRODUCT THEY'RE

03:13:04.105 --> 03:13:06.474
GOING TO GET IN RETURN- WE NEED

03:13:06.541 --> 03:13:07.809
TO GET QUALITY REPORTS WE'VE

03:13:07.876 --> 03:13:09.711
HEARD PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW THE

03:13:09.778 --> 03:13:11.379
WHAT EIGHTY PERCENT- OF HOW

03:13:11.446 --> 03:13:12.447
MANY PERCENT OF. REPORTS ARE

03:13:12.514 --> 03:13:14.416
NOT GOOD QUALITY. I'M VERY

03:13:14.482 --> 03:13:15.917
LEERY OF THROWING MONEY. AT

03:13:15.984 --> 03:13:17.986
THIS AT A SITUATION OR TO

03:13:18.053 --> 03:13:19.955
SCENARIO OR SYSTEM THAT'S BEING

03:13:20.021 --> 03:13:21.156
DESCRIBED AS BROKEN WERE ALL

03:13:21.222 --> 03:13:22.724
THE REPORTS ARE BAD. AND WE

03:13:22.791 --> 03:13:23.725
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

03:13:23.792 --> 03:13:24.893
THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:26.394
NEEDED. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO

03:13:26.461 --> 03:13:27.429
LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN THE

03:13:27.495 --> 03:13:31.666
WHOLE PROCESS. WE NEED

03:13:31.733 --> 03:13:33.368
CONSISTENCY WE NEED SOMETHING

03:13:33.435 --> 03:13:34.569
THAT'S PREDICTABLE NOW WHETHER

03:13:34.636 --> 03:13:35.870
THAT NEED TO BE BROKEN DOWN

03:13:35.937 --> 03:13:37.472
AMONG SPECIALTIES I THINK I

03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:39.474
THINK THAT'S A GREAT DISCUSSION

03:13:39.541 --> 03:13:40.608
FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND I HOPE AND

03:13:40.675 --> 03:13:43.178
I HOPE THEY HAVE THAT- I THINK

03:13:43.244 --> 03:13:44.212
THERE PROBABLY SHOULD BE SOME

03:13:44.279 --> 03:13:46.414
DISTINCTION BETWEEN YOU KNOW A

03:13:46.481 --> 03:13:47.682
QUOTE ON QUOTE RUN OF THE MILL

03:13:47.749 --> 03:13:49.684
CASES IF THERE EVER WAS ONE OR

03:13:49.751 --> 03:13:50.719
SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY

03:13:50.785 --> 03:13:51.853
COMPLICATED WHETHER THAT

03:13:51.920 --> 03:13:53.788
INVOLVES MULTIPLE BODY PARTS

03:13:53.855 --> 03:13:55.190
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING

03:13:55.256 --> 03:13:55.991
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE PART

03:13:56.057 --> 03:13:57.525
OF THE DISCUSSION YEAH LIVE%

03:13:57.592 --> 03:13:58.526
OPERABLE WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW

03:13:58.593 --> 03:14:00.762
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING

03:14:00.829 --> 03:14:01.296
THAT'S- HAS SO MANY MOVING

03:14:01.363 --> 03:14:03.932
PARTS. MANY ON TO FOCUS ON ON

03:14:03.999 --> 03:14:05.433
ON ONE IN ON A CERTAIN

03:14:05.500 --> 03:14:07.836
PERCENTAGE I THINK- IS A LITTLE

03:14:07.902 --> 03:14:09.237
IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS. CAN YOU

03:14:09.304 --> 03:14:10.739

GROUPS. AND I THINK THEY HAVE A

03:14:15.977 --> 03:14:17.679
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. PUT

03:14:17.746 --> 03:14:21.149
THEIR OPINION SEN. TALK WITH

03:14:21.216 --> 03:14:22.083

SCHEDULE THAT PROVIDES ADEQUATE

03:14:38.733 --> 03:14:41.036
REPRESENTATION AND THEN IT'S

03:14:41.102 --> 03:14:43.338
REALLY AND THEN ALSO I THINK WE

03:14:43.405 --> 03:14:44.606
NEED SIMPLICITY IN THIS WE NEED

03:14:44.672 --> 03:14:46.741
MORE SIMPLICITY IN OUR SYSTEM

03:14:46.808 --> 03:14:47.709
WE HAVE A LOT OF RULES WE HAVE

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:49.644
A LOT OF OBLIGATIONS THERE HAVE

03:14:49.711 --> 03:14:51.813
BEEN STATUTES AND REFORMS THAT

YEARS THAT HAD MORE BUT BUT

ADDED ON TOP. NO INSTEAD

03:14:57.952 --> 03:14:59.921
INSTEAD OF SAYING LOOK LET'S

03:14:59.988 --> 03:15:00.655
JUST PEELED THIS BACK AND SEE

03:15:00.722 --> 03:15:02.590
WHAT'S REALLY NECESSARY

03:15:02.657 --> 03:15:04.592
ADEQUATE COMPENSATION I AGREE

03:15:04.659 --> 03:15:06.895
SIMPLICITY IN THE SYSTEM AND

03:15:06.961 --> 03:15:08.396
THEN YOU KNOW WE RELY ON

03:15:08.463 --> 03:15:09.964
PRIVATE ON PRIDE ON PRIVATE

03:15:10.031 --> 03:15:12.167
DOCTORS TO JOIN OUR SYSTEM IN

03:15:12.233 --> 03:15:15.003
WE COULD SELL IT TO THEM I

03:15:15.070 --> 03:15:15.770
WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD I WOULD

03:15:15.837 --> 03:15:17.472
HOPE THEY WOULD JOIN GOT IT

03:15:17.539 --> 03:15:19.207
RIGHT AND THEN CAN YOU JUST

03:15:19.274 --> 03:15:20.075
MENTIONED WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT

03:15:20.141 --> 03:15:22.043
AND ALL THE OTHER PANELS BUT-

03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:23.912
THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS OF

03:15:23.978 --> 03:15:25.613
THE COURT CASE SO WHAT HAPPENED

03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:28.416
AND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND-

03:15:28.483 --> 03:15:31.052
WHAT GOT ADDRESSED THERE WAS AN

03:15:31.119 --> 03:15:32.353
ALLEGATION THAT WE WERE USING

03:15:32.420 --> 03:15:33.655
UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. A

03:15:33.721 --> 03:15:36.391
COURT CASE WAS FILED- I THINK A

03:15:36.458 --> 03:15:38.293
DECISION WAS REACHED- THAT

03:15:38.359 --> 03:15:39.928
THROUGHOUT THE CASE ON ON

03:15:39.994 --> 03:15:41.563
JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS BECAUSE

03:15:41.629 --> 03:15:42.897
IT WASN'T RAISED BEFORE THE W.

03:15:42.964 --> 03:15:45.333
C. A. B. THERE WAS DICTA IN THE

03:15:45.400 --> 03:15:46.434
DECISION SAYING THAT WE

03:15:46.501 --> 03:15:47.502
POSSIBLY HAD UNDERGROUND

03:15:47.569 --> 03:15:49.370
REGULATIONS. AT THAT POINT I

03:15:49.437 --> 03:15:50.872
THINK BOTH SIDES CAME TO THE

03:15:50.939 --> 03:15:52.707
TABLE AND SAY LET'S SETTLE THIS

03:15:52.774 --> 03:15:54.542
AND WE DID- YOU KNOW I CAN'T

03:15:54.609 --> 03:15:56.544
HAVE. THEM AS A MENTION I DON'T

03:15:56.611 --> 03:15:57.846
HAVE A BIG STE I DON'T HAVE A

03:15:57.912 --> 03:15:59.681
BIG STAFF HERE TO DO A LOT OF

03:15:59.747 --> 03:16:01.749
THIS WORK. AND I CAN'T HAVE

03:16:01.816 --> 03:16:03.751
THEM SPENDING ALL OF THEIR DEBT

03:16:03.818 --> 03:16:04.919
ALL THEIR TIME. FIGHTING

03:16:04.986 --> 03:16:07.455
LITIGATION. NO WEEDS WITH SO

03:16:07.522 --> 03:16:09.290
THE CASE WAS SETTLED SETTLED ON

03:16:09.357 --> 03:16:11.392
BOTH SIDES. FEDERAL OKAY. AND

03:16:11.459 --> 03:16:13.728
THEN IT HUNTING THAT STRUCK ME

03:16:13.795 --> 03:16:14.362
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

03:16:14.429 --> 03:16:15.530
DUE PROCESS CERTAINLY- BUT THEN

03:16:15.597 --> 03:16:18.299
IF. YOU KNOW TO HEARINGS IN

03:16:18.366 --> 03:16:20.368
THREE YEARS IT SEEMS HOW ARE WE

03:16:20.435 --> 03:16:21.669
ADDRESSING THE DUE PROCESS

03:16:21.736 --> 03:16:23.371
ISSUE IF THAT'S THE CASE WELL I

03:16:23.438 --> 03:16:25.273
THINK AS THEY SAY WHAT HAVE

03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:27.876
WHAT HAPPENED IN 200-014-2000

03:16:27.942 --> 03:16:28.877
SIXTEEN. YOU KNOW I THINK CARP

WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT WE

03:16:33.114 --> 03:16:35.683
ARE. FOLLOWING THE ADMIN A

03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:36.284

HAPPENED IN THE PAST I THINK

03:16:44.526 --> 03:16:47.162
JUST IN THE HOUSE- I THINK WHAT

03:16:47.228 --> 03:16:48.196
WE'RE DOING NOW IS ENTIRELY

03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:49.097
APPROPRIATE. IT WAS INDIVIDUAL

03:16:49.164 --> 03:16:49.998
CASES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP

03:16:50.064 --> 03:16:51.533
HERE WHATEVER I DON'T I. CAN'T

03:16:51.599 --> 03:16:53.168
SAY I KNOW ABOUT THEM OFF HAND

SOMEONE DIDN'T FIT A- THE

03:16:57.505 --> 03:16:57.939
PHYSICIAN WAS TO BEING

03:16:58.006 --> 03:17:01.376
DISCIPLINED BY US. BECAUSE OR

03:17:01.442 --> 03:17:01.910
OR OR SOME LETTER WAS SENT

03:17:01.976 --> 03:17:02.510
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SPEND AN

03:17:02.577 --> 03:17:04.712
HOUR. THE PATIENT HAD TO GO

03:17:04.779 --> 03:17:05.180
HOME EARLY WELL THAT'S

03:17:05.246 --> 03:17:07.649
SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO SEE. AND

03:17:09.551 --> 03:17:13.454
TOMORROW. OKAY I APPRECIATE

03:17:13.521 --> 03:17:14.022
THAT BECAUSE WE JUST TRY TO

03:17:14.088 --> 03:17:17.091
FIGURE OUT. NO DUE PROCESS AND

03:17:17.158 --> 03:17:17.592
HOW DO WE MAKE THAT MORE

03:17:17.659 --> 03:17:18.760
EFFICIENT FOR EVERYBODY AND-

03:17:18.826 --> 03:17:19.360

WE HAVE TO CALM DOWN A BIT. AND

03:17:42.817 --> 03:17:44.752
