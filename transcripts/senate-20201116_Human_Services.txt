OVER BURDENED BY. THE PANDEMIC THIS SUBSEQUENT RECESSION AND OTHER OTHER- BURDENS. WE ARE. WE ALSO HAD ANOTHER SERVED AT THEIR THERE IS. THERE IS APPROPRIATE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THAT SOMETIMES FAMILY TIME OFTEN KNOWN AS PARENTS AND SIBLING VISITS CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED THAT THE IN PERSON CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY- WE'VE SEEN VIRTUAL FAMILY DINNERS VIRTUAL TIME VIRTUAL STORYTELLING ALL THAT SEEMS TO SUPPLEMENT AND SUPPORT- THE IMPORTANT I. CONNECTION BETWEEN SIBLINGS AND PARENTS- AND- IN THESE DAYS OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE'VE NOTICED AND OBSERVED THAT FOSTER YOUTH. AND CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE CREATE HAS. RESILIENT AND STRONG AND YET THEY SILL HAVE NEEDS CLEARLY AS YOU NOTED EARLIER AND THEN I GOT SUGGESTED THAT WE SPEND SOME TIME ON TODAY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE DO YOU NEED SUPPORT WHEN IT COMES TO STAY CONNECTED TO THEIR THEIR THEIR FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY. WITH ME IT WAS SUPPORT FOR AT EDUCATION AND JOBS. WE ARE. MAINTAINING CONNECTIONS AND THINKING THROUGH RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND IN THESE DAYS OF. A RECENT SURVEY THAT WE GADGET WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED FOSTER PARENTS RESOURCE FAMILIES IN FOUR COUNTIES DEMONSTRATED THAT OVER 82% OF THEMSELVES THAT THEY WERE DOING GOOD OR VERY GOOD RANGE AND YET THEY WERE STILL NEEDS WORK THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN TERMS OF CHILD CARE. SUPPORT YOUR DISTANCE EDUCATION INCLUDING TUTORING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR CARE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AS SO MANY OF HAD TO DIG INTO THEIR OWN- RESOURCES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. SUPPORTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR CARE. AND MANY FAMILIES HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE HAD THE NEED HAVE EXPRESSED NEEDS FOR CONCRETE SERVICES GROCERIES CLEANING SUPPLIES OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. GIVEN THAT THE NATURE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND SUBSEQUENT RECESSION. AS I MENTIONED WE ARE REALLY RELY VERY DEEPLY ON ANSWER AND ASKED ARE ARE ARE CARE GIVING COMMUNITY TO. TO REALLY STRETCH AND TO AND TO THINK OF THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND TO SUPPORT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE AND THAT IT DOES AND BOTH. RESOURCE FAMILIES RELATIVE CAREGIVERS AND OUR RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS ALL HAVE HAVE DONE SO AND YET THEY ALL STILL NEED. SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT ESPECIALLY AROUND DISTANCE LEARNING AROUND SOCIAL AND RECREATIONAL- CONNECTIONS. I JUST LIKE TO ALSO NOTE IF YOU KEEP OTHER. THINGS AS PART OF MY TESTIMONY- DEBT CERTAINLY. WHEN IT COMES TO REUNIFICATION WITH FAMILIES- PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN SERVICES ARE SO OFTEN NOW JOHN THROUGH VIRTUAL MEANS AND WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT DOES IT MEAN. IN TERMS OF SH PROVIDING THE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT THAT FACT THAT PARENTS NEED IN ORDER TO REUNIFY APPROPRIATELY AND I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO. ASK OUR SERVICE SECTOR TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. THROUGH ITS USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND TO THINK ABOUT THAT THE PRUDENT AND APPROPRIATE USE OF IN PERSON AND FACE TO FACE CONTACTS WHEN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. WE CERTAINLY HAS NOTICED THAT ARE. THAT OUR PARENTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AND ARE REAL AND NEED TO ATTEND COURT NEED ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY EITHER- THROUGH THEM. THROUGH THEIR OWN PER TO GET IT TO THEM PERSONALLY OR TO PROVIDE SPACES FOR THEM TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES. THE APPROPRIATE KINDS OF A CLASSROOM OF COURSE FOR THAT THEY NEED AND COURT SERVICES WHICH WILL. WORK PARTICULARLY HAVE SOME OF THAT- CONCERNED ABOUT- WHAT THIS MEANS FOR SEXUALLY EXPLOITED- YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE- AND OUT ON THE STREETS WITH WITH GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF THE INCREASED NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE ONLINE IN THE PREDATORY NATURE OF SO MANY OF THE TRAFFICKERS THERE'S SOME CONCERNED ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE I CAN. SAY STATE AND AWAY FROM. DESPITE THESE OF. OUR CLEARLY GIVEN THE THAT STRESSES WE ALL HAVE- CONCERNED ABOUT THE- THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE- OUT ON THE STREETS OR AWAY FROM HOME WE MAY HAVE TO RELY ON SOME KIND OF START SURVIVAL SEX AND WITH THOSE I THINK I ALSO CREATE A HEIGHTENED OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPLOITATION AND SO WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT. THESE YOU. CLEARLY. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF TECHNOLOGY TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN CARE- OUR WORK WITH- WITH IT WITH THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THEIR MOST RECENT- CHANGING POLICY THAT- THAT. WOULD ALLOW IDEATIONAL THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE SPENT ON INCREASED DATA PLANS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO. ARE THE BENEFICIARIES BENEFICIARIES UP THOSE- OF THOSE RESOURCES IS IMPORTANT SO. TO THAT THE FACT THAT WE PROVIDED TECHNOLOGY IS HELPFUL TOO. MANY PEOPLE STILL NEED TECHNOLOGY AND THEN THERE'S ACCESS TO DATA. BROADBAND AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE THEY CONTINUED TO BE. CONTINUE TO BE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS FROM OUR- FROM OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES BUT YOU KNOW THE BALANCE BETWEEN. WORK FORCE AT A SAFETY AND THE MULTI TASKING OF THE CURRENT WORKFORCE WHO ARE WHO ARE OFTEN PARENTS AND IF THEY ARE NOT THEY ARE OFTEN CARE GIVERS FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS. THERE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS THERE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF KIDS AND FAMILIES IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT TENSION. EXISTS ADD AT IN IN THIS DAY AND AGE SIMILARLY THE TENSION BETWEEN- ONGOING. ACTIONS BETWEEN. SIBLINGS AND- AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND IN NEED OF THEIR CARE GIVERS TO ALSO MAINTAIN. THE SAFETY OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD IS AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT I THINK WE TOGETHER NEED TO. CHECK GRAPPLE WITH. I THINK WE NEED TO STAY VIGILANT IN KKK% ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT SURGE IN OUR RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW THE THAT THAT THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO- THROUGH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER AND OTHER THINGS TO OUR CARE GIVING- WORKFORCE AND FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THOSE. IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AND MOST OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WE NEED TO ALL STAY CONNECTED TOGETHER WE ALL ARE ON IN IN THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE OUR COMMUNITY AND ADVOCATES AND YOUNG PEOPLE.

THANK YOU MOVING ON WALL. OUR NEXT SPEAKER SON JOB A GUY OF THE DIRECTOR KINGS COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES EIGHT AGENCY. IS STILL FREE TO AND MEET YOURSELF AND BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ONE OF THE DAY. KINGS COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. AND I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT OURS IS THAT REALLY WHAT THIS AND THEN IT HAS PROVEN THAT OUR SYSTEM AND OUR KIDS AND OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE. NON FRAGILE AND RHETORICAL AND THERE'S MANY MANY THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING REALLY WELL. BUT I WANT TO FOCUS MY MONEY AND MY FEW MINUTES ON THREE AREAS WHERE I DO THINK WE GENUINELY NEED RECORD AND ARE THE AREAS WHERE I YES- I'M- HAVING. SOME CHALLENGES IN THE MONTHS TO COME. HOPEFULLY NOT YEARS AGO. TO THE FOR ONE OF THOSE IS THE SUPPORT FOR. RESOURCE FAMILY. WE ARE A- MEDIUM SIZED BUT ON SMALLER OF THAT. SPECTRUM WE- ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE KIDS- IN. THEN AND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO KIDS WHO ARE IN PLACEMENT. AND OF THOSE 61% OF OUR KIDS ARE IN REPORTS FAMILY. AND WHILE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS KINGS COUNTY HAS WORKED REALLY HARD TO- GROW THE NUMBER OF RECOURSE FAMILY. SIMPLY BECAUSE IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE NO OTHER OPTION. THERE IS NO FOSTER FAMILY AGENCY THERE IN A GROUP HOME AND- EVEN IF WE GET. RESERVE FAMILIES ARE A MUCH BETTER PLACE THAN OPTION THE REASON CREDIT MORE. AND MORE CRITICAL NOW ASSEMBLY THAT KIDS OUT OF THE- OUT OF THE COUNTY OUT. OF THE STATE- HAVE. HIGHER TELL AND- WITH THEIR COMMUTE AND WITH FAMILIES. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A READERS HOW MORE THAN HALF AWAY ARE RELATIVE. IS THE- FOR THEIR ON ONE CUSTOMER TIME TO BE GROWN MAN TO GET ACROSS THE EVEN OUTSIDE THE- CHALLENGING IT IS NOW EVEN MORE SO WITH ALL OF THAT PROCESS IS MOVING ONLINE AND THE TO THE CAPACITY TO- TO UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW THAT. REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL ONE ON ONE ATTENTION. AREA ABOUT 19% DROP. IN APPLICATIONS AND YET OUR SOCIAL WORKER TIME HER. FAMILY TO GET THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS AND ACTUALLY INCREASE AND WE'RE STARTING TO BE A SLOW BUILD A- BACK ON BECAUSE IT JUST. IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM THINGS HAVE JUST GONE DOWN. THE OTHER PIECE WHICH IS NEW- INDEPENDENT IS THAT- OUR EXISTING RESEARCH FAMILIES THAT ARE NOT GOING TO WERE YOU ACROSS THAT. NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. RELATED TO. COULD AND UNDERSTOOD THE OF THE HAVE CHANGED- ONLINE COLIN HANLEY PEOPLE NEEDING TO WORRIES ABOUT EXPOSURE REQUIRES THAT ONE ON ONE INTERVENTION AND IT REALLY IS ONE THING THAT MAKES THE MOST VETERANS. TO ARI ASSEMBLY WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS A CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. OUR KIDS AND BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN MANAGE. THROUGH THE INTERNET. WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE OVER THE PAST FEW WE AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY OUR OUR THEY ALLOCATE. AND I THINK IN THAT TREND IS ONLY GOING TO GROW- COULD NOT FIGURING OUT HOW TO GROW THE SUPPORT AND GROW THE SOCIAL WORKER TIME PEOPLE ARE READY FOR FAMILY IS REALLY ONE OF MY- AND THE OTHER ONE IS B. R. AUTHOR KAREN RESOURCE FUNDING THAT. WE REALLY HAVE YOU IS AS A ANYTHING FOR THE FAMILY NEEDS- IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL I DO THINK THAT IS THE KIND OF APPROACH WE NEED. I IN ORDER TO SUPPORT EVERY FIRST PARENT- NINE. THE SECOND AREA WHERE WE'RE SEEING A NEED FOR SOCIAL WORKER TIME WHICH BECOME A- PATTERN OF THE NEEDS. IS IN OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THAT WE'RE THE COUNTY THAT DID NOT EXPERIENCE A 40% DROP AND REFERRAL BUT WE DID EXPERIENCE. SIX MONTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR ON THE LOOK AT PAST SIX MONTHS COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR. BUT PERCENT DROP IN REFERRAL. HOWEVER WHEN I LOOK AT THE- OUR ITALIAN WAIT OUT VERSES ARE IMMEDIATE REFERRAL TO DOCTOR DROP IS VERY DIFFERENT WE ACTUALLY ARE GETTING MORE CALLS- MEDIA CALL CAROLINE PORCELAIN. AND THAT SOCIAL WORKER TIME INVESTIGATING AND THEN PERSONAL WORK OR TIME IN CONNECTING FAMILIES TO RESOURCES. IT IS A LOT MORE- INTENT. BECAUSE THAT SHOULD. AVAILABILITY WHERE OF RESOURCES SUCH AS- ALL RIGHT ALL OF THE RESOURCES ARE NOW ONLINE FIGURING OUT HOW TO ACCESS THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE CLOSED OR THEIR ONLINE THAT THAT SOCIAL WORKER BEING INSIDE THE HOME AND CONNECTING THE FAMILY IN A MORE INTENSE THREE TO RESOURCES THAT CHECKING IN ON THE FAMILY MORE FREQUENTLY IS ACTUALLY EVEN OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAUSING A YOU NEED MORE SOCIAL WORKER TIME- CASE AND ONE THING THAT REALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM THAT BAD IN. IN OF MY THIRD AREA OF PROBABLY ALL SIGNIFICANTLY IN OUR ONGOING CASES WHEN WE LOOK AT- AFFECTS NINE COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME LAST YEAR I CASES HAVE GROWN SLIGHTLY WHAT'S MORE STRIKING THOUGH IS THAT OUR FAMILY MILLION CASES AND DROPPED 27% AND WE AND THAT HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY GROWTH IN FAMILY REUNIFICATION CASES BY PERMANENTLY CASES THAT ARE PENDING ADOPTION BY TWENTY THREE PERCENT. BUT WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IF THAT HAS AN EFFECT. THEM ARE STAYING LONGER- AND- THAT WE'RE GOING TO GROW IN OUR AND AMOUNT OF TIME IT ACTUALLY TAKE CRICKET WHERE THE SERVICE SUCH AS HEALTH. PARENTING CLASS ALL BEING ON AND THERE'S JUST GENERALLY OF THEM. BONTA TRANSFER L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt; THAT SERVICES CAN BE LOOK LIKE FAMILY NOT- ENGAGING AND PROFESSIONAL WORKER TRULY WHICH ONE IS THE CASE- ISRAEL TAKES TIME FOLLOW UP IF AND HOLD A PARENT TO THAT PROCESS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW I CAN HELP THEM MEET THESE CHALLENGES BUT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING- EXPANSION OF THE- BUT UNIFICATION TIMELINE WHICH IS GOING TO KEEP OUR CASES LONGER IN EACH COMPONENT AND WILL REQUIRE AND REALLY FOR THE FAMILIES THAT. WE GO THROUGH THAT FOR KIDS ACTUALLY- AND FAMILIES COULD BE OKAY WE'RE GOING TO NEED EACH ONE OF THESE. CATEGORIES JUST OVERALL MORE. MORE ONE ON TIME WITH GAME AND IS TRULY WHAT HAS MADE DIFFERENCE BOKAR- PLANNING FOR THAT I IN A- TO CON IS TO BE CRITICAL. AND IN THE FINAL PIECE WHERE OUR SOCIAL WORKER TIME CRITICAL NATIONAL IN A SMALLER COUNTY. AS AS WE'VE BROUGHT IN ALL THEM IN PERSON- KEEP RECORD OF THAT AND VISITATION AND AUGMENTED THEM I FELT WITH THE ONLINE- AND ARE TOLD THAT. IT IS JUST TAKING MORE. TIME FOR K. IT- I WOULD DEVOTE KIND OF. CHALLENGED THAT WHEN HAVE GET BECAUSE THE INCOME CONTACT THAT COULD EXPOSURE IS A FACTOR AND THAT. IMPACTING HOW ARE SOCIAL WORKERS MANAGING THE REST OF THEIR WORKLOAD FIGURING OUT HOW TO NOT TAKE IT OUT OF THE PART OF THE EQUATION THAT WE ARE GOING TO QUARANTINE FAST. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR WORK- IS REALLY IN FACTORING HOW WE NEED TO PASS- IN THE FUTURE. I DO THINK ALL OF THE CHALLENGE ARE MANAGEABLE AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE DONE A LOT TO HAVE IT IN A JAR DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS. I DO THINK ASKING CONTINUE- IN THE COMING YEAR AND AS NUMBERS ARE GROWING THAT THE CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO. BE A BIGGER STRUCTURES ON OUR SYSTEM THE FIGURING OUT HOW TO SUPPORT THAT AND- BUT AUGMENTING. I APPRECIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SANDRA UP NEXT WE HAVE A DAVID GREEN SOCIAL WORKER THREE WILL D'ANGELO'S COUNTY ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID GREEN AND I'VE SERVED TWENTY YEARS AS A CHILDREN'S SOCIAL WORKER WITH LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES I'M ALSO THE ELECTED TREASURER MY UNION SEIU LOCAL SEVENTY ONE WHICH REPRESENTS NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS IN SUNNY CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SK YOU STATE COUNCIL. NINE MONTHS INTO THAT COULD BE NINETEEN CAN ENDEMIC I WISH I COULD SAY WE'VE TURNED THE CORNER. ON THIS TRAGEDY BUT THE NUMBERS TELL A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS LOCKDOWNS SCHOOL IN CORK CLOSURES MASS UNEMPLOYMENT. I'VE BEEN PUTTING IN CONTINUE TO PUT CHILDREN AT INCREASED RISK OF ABUSE NEGLECT. PANDEMIC IS EXPOSED TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE JUVENILE COURTS. HERE TO DEAL WITH THE DISASTER OF THIS MAGNITUDE. INTERNUS PRESSURE ON CHILDREN SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE FAMILIES WE SERVE I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES. THE LOSS OF MANDATED REPORTERS BUT SCHOOLS GOING REMOTE AND AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES SUSPENDED CHURCHES HOLDEN SERVICES ORIGINAL NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS DELAYED AND FAMILY GATHERINGS SOCIAL DISTANCE CHILDREN SOCIAL WORKERS LOST THEIR BEST ALLIES IN PREVENTING ABUSE. TRADITIONALLY LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT HOTLINE RECEIVES ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND CALLS PER MONTH WHEN THE STATE SHUT DOWN IN MARCH THERE ON MARCH THIRTEENTH THAT NUMBER DROPPED BY 50% THAT IS A NO WAY INDICATIVE OF THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS OF CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT. REDUCED BY THAT AMOUNT INSTEAD IT ONLY HAD TO DO WITH MANDATE REPORTERS NO LONGER HAVING THEIR EYES ON THESE VULNERABLE CHILDREN. ON MARCH THIRTEENTH WE LOST THE TEACHERS DOCTORS CLERGY COMMUNITY LEADERS ANOTHER MANDATE REPORTERS WHO TRADITIONALLY FLAG ABUSE. THE FAILURE TO TREAT SOCIAL WORKERS AS FIRST RESPONDERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS WEATHER IS OBTAINING PP OR BE ON A LIST FOR A POTENTIAL FUTURE VACCINATION. SOCIAL WORKERS BY THE FRONT LINE KEEPING CHILDREN SAFE. STORE DIRECTOR BY THE CABLE AND THEL. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADVOCATE FOR LIFESAVING PP. THE PRESSURE TO RESUME COLD IS IT'S UNDER UNSAFE CONDITIONS. THE FIRST THING SOCIAL WORKERS WANT TO DO IS PROTECT KIDS FROM ABUSE. THAT MEANS OPPOSITES BUT THE LAST THING SOCIAL WORKERS WANT TO DO IS PUT FAMILIES AT RISK BY THEIR OWN ACTIONS. THEIR SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES IN THE UNITED STATES THE REQUIRED SOCIAL WORKERS TO RESUME HOME VISITS WITHOUT PROPERTY P. WITHOUT PROPER SCREENING TESTING PER CONTRACT TRACING. OF CLIENTS OR STAFF. MAY PROGRESS STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS IN THE FAMILIES WE SERVE INCLUDING. MAKING SURE WORKPLACES AND OTHER FACILITIES ARE CONFIGURED TO ALLOW PROPER SOCIAL DISTANCING. ENSURE THAT OUR CLIENTS IN THE FAMILIES WE WORK WITH WEAR MASKS. BUT THERE'S TRANSPARENCY NOTIFICATION WHEN SOMEONE IN A FACILITY TEST POSITIVE FOR GROUP IN NINETEEN. YEAH SOCIAL% WORKERS NEED EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT THEM FROM KOBE AND HELP THEM PROTECT THEIR CLIENTS FROM CONTRACTING OR SPREADING COBIT. THE COURTS IN TECHNOLOGY THE PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED HOW UNDERFUNDED AND TECHNOLOGICALLY BACKWARDS THE JUVENILE COURTS ARE COMPARED WITH CRIMINAL AND CIVIL. CRIMINAL AND CIVIL COUNTERPARTS. TONY KEPT REMOVING CHILDREN FROM HOUSEHOLDS WITH A DECENT LACK WAS ALLEGED AFTER THE PANDEMIC WAS DECLARED BUT THE PRESIDING JUDGE CLOSE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURTS OR MID MARCH THROUGH THE SUMMER. DISCLOSURE STRANDED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN IN L. A. COUNTY CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AND PUT THEM IN LEGAL LIMBO. TO ATTENDED PARENTING CLASSES OR SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ADDICTION TREATMENT I HAD NO WAY TO GET THEIR CHILDREN BACK. GRANDPARENTS AND RELATIVES WILLING TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN TAKEN FROM THE BIRTH PARENTS IN PLACE TO GROUP FOR GROUP HOMES AND FOSTER HOMES. NO WAY TO BRING THE CHILDREN BACK TO FAMILY HOMES. THIS EPISODE PROMPTED CS W'S AND OTHER CHILDREN ADVOCATES TO IDENTIFY LOW AND NO COST WAYS TO BREAK THE LOGJAM. KEEP CHILDREN HELP CHILDREN GET STATE SUPPORT OF HOMES. WE MUST EXPLORE GREATER ELECTRONIC FILING AND SERVING OF MOTIONS WITNESS LISTS. COURT REPORTS AND OTHER FILINGS WE MUST DRAMATICALLY INCREASE YOUR CONFERENCING MEETINGS TO DEVELOP CONSENSUS ON STIPULATED ORDERS FOR PRESENTATION TO JUDGES OVER WEBEX. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO MOVE FORWARD AS A MENTION OF THE OPS AT THE OUTSET WHEN SCHOOLS FULLY REOPENED WE ANTICIPATE A DRAMATIC UPTICK IN THE NUMBER OF CALLS. WE START WILL START ONCE AGAIN RECEIVING FOR MERCHANTS TO RESPONSE HOTLINE STATEWIDE. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE NATURE OF THE SEVERITY THESE CALLS WILL BE MUCH MORE INTENSIVE. REQUIRE MUCH MORE ENGAGEMENT AND AS A RESULT OF NOT HAVING EYES ON EACH OF LEARN FOR NEARLY A YEAR MORE. BECAUSE OF THIS IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE STATE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO COUNTIES- FRONTLINE SOCIAL WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE CALLS- AS YOU SEEN AND OTHER CHILD WELFARE RENO'S. COACH IS THE BEST MODEL TO ENSURE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED FOR DETENTION. THAT MEANS NOT ONLY FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL CHILD WELFARE SOCIAL WORKERS BUT PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES ELIGIBILITY WORKERS HE ROLE IN MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO WORK IN TEAMS WITH THESE KIDS. AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE GET THESE CALLS. OVER AGENCIES AND SOCIAL WORKERS NEED TO BE TRAINED TO HELP CLIENTS STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS DEADLY DISEASE. AND AGENCIES MUST INVEST IN TESTING CLIENTS BEEN PERFORMING CONTRACTOR USING WHEN THEY LEARN AQUINAS BEEN INFECTED. THERE'S A MAJOR NEED TO TRAIN MANDATED REPORTERS AND THE PUBLIC TO LOOK FOR ABUSE OUR CURRENT SOCIAL DISTANCE VIDEO CONFERENCE WORLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISTER GREENE- AT THIS MOMENT WE WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS- YOU DON'T KNOW IT EARLIER THERE WAS MENTION ABOUT- SUPPORT SERVICES. AND THE NEED FOR OUR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES STROP THAN EDUCATION- FOR MR ROSE- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT FOR FOSTER YOUTH IN. THE WE COULD DO YOU KNOW A BETTER JOB AND MAKING SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THEY THEY FIND A PATH TO SUCCESS. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION YEAH I WOULD NOTE THAT. IT'S IT PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC CLEARLY THERE WAS A CHALLENGE RELATED TO- WORKING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN GENERAL BUT ESPECIALLY OUR FOSTER YOUTH. AND SO GIVEN THAT A LOT. OF THAT PREPARATORY WORK HAPPENS THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAMS AND SOME OTHERS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BAD AND- KIND OF CLASSROOM BASED I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. OUR PARTNER AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. OF ALL THAT FORMAT AND I DO THINK THERE'S A POTENTIALLY IN NEED TO DO SOME. PARTNERING WITH WITH- WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS TO MAKE SOME OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE I THINK IN THE SHORT TERM. IT ALSO PREPARING YOUNG PEOPLE FOR- FOR. THE WORKING WORLD IN WHATEVER WAY WE CAN GIVEN THAT THE LIMITATIONS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ARE ARE IMPORTANT IN OUR PRIMARY A WAY TO DO THAT WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES IS THROUGH- THE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM AND SOME. AND SOME OF THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH- REFERRALS. AND RESOURCES FOR THAT YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. THANK YOU AT CALLING DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL. AS SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- ACTUALLY- SINCE MR ROSA DR ROSENSTEIN WE HAVE YOU TO ACT SO WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY FROM- MISTER GREEN ABOUT- THE NEED FOR PP IN THE ROLE OF SOCIAL WORKERS AND AS ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SO FORTH AND I AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THIS HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND- BUT TO IN YOUR ROLE IS- DEPUTY DIRECTOR DSF IT DOES HARM SOCIAL SERVICES WHAT WHAT KIND OF- CONVERSATIONS ARE YOU HAVING WITH OTHER AGENCIES LIKE THE CDPH AND SO FORTH ABOUT. THE ROLE OF- SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE DID YOU KNOW WHAT WORKING WITH FOSTER YOUTH IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF RESOURCES WE NEED FOR THEM AND ALSO BE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE KIND OF EQUIPMENT THEY NEED A COMMENT OF COURSE PRIOR TO COVET THEY DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE- SO WORDY FALL ON THAT PRIORITY LIST AND SO FORTH AS WE ARE TRYING TO GET MORE P. E. OUT EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY A VACCINE BUT THAT'S STILL GOING TO BE AWHILE EVEN DESPITE ALL THE EXCITING NEWS WE'RE HEARING AND- AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW WE'RE RIGHT NOW I THINK THE GOVERNOR JUST ANNOUNCED A FEW HOURS AGO WERE YOU OVER TO ME CASES ARE SKYROCKETING BEGINNING CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE IT'S GONE. IN ORDER KEEP PEOPLE SAFE WE DO HAVE TO LIMIT CONTACT I CAN SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT- DSS IS DOING TO HELP THE SYSTEM- THE SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE FOSTER CARE FAMILIES IN TERMS OF BEING SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP STRUCTURE THAT THE SUPPORT. AND ALSO THE OVERSIGHT GOING. SURE THING YOU SENATOR. THREE TO THE QUESTION AROUND CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS- FROMTHE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC UP ALL THE WAY THROUGH LAST WEEK WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE FOLKS AT DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TRYING TO CONTINUALLY OF ALL OF OUR OUR GUIDE IS BASED ON THE CURRENT SCIENCE AND THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF. OF THE WORK SO THAT WE CAN- HE- CAN SAVE. AND ABANDON THE WORKFORCE- STATES YOU. WITH RESPECT. NOTING WITH RESPECT TO THE. THE PP. IN THE WAY THAT IT IT IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THAT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THROUGH ITS OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE EMERGING DEMAND SERVICES WE'VE HAD ACROSS SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. THROUGHOUT THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE LAST NINE MONTHS OR SO. YES THEY WERE HAVING. DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING A COPY THAT WE WOULD WORK THROUGH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE KIND OF CARE THAT IS THE DATE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. SIMILARLY WITH OUR- COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION WE HAVE ALL OF OUR REGIONAL OFFICES HAVE A PP AVAILABLE AND ARE AND CAN MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO. FOSTER PARENTS AND RESIDENTIAL PROVIDERS DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES IF THERE IS A SPECIFIC OUTBREAK OR- OR AT A HIGH LEVEL OF NEED OFTEN THAT DEPARTMENTS- EP DISTRIBUTION IS IT IS BILLS THAT GAP INTEL GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABLE TO DO SO. BUT NONETHELESS WE ARE MEETING WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES- TWICE A WEEK. ON A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS INCLUDING ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR- OUR GUIDANCE AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF. OUR OUR GUIDANCE IS UP TO DATE AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR NEEDS AND- IS ALSO A CURRENT IN. FOR IT FOREMOST IN OUR MINDS- A PRE THAT- SOME SAID. A SOMETIMES GET THINGS LOST BETWEEN THE- IN US ARE BE OF HOUSE. AND WE HAVE NURSING HOMES AND SO FORTH AND- WE NEED TO BE SURE AS- THAT- OUR OUR FIRST TO USE AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE ARE BOTH BEING KEPT SAFE BUT ALSO- THAT WERE IDENTIFYING CASES OF. ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND AS I THINK WAS MENTIONED- UNFORTUNATELY THE MANY THE PLACE POINTS OF CONTACT ARE NOW REDUCED BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING TO REMOTE BUT- WE STILL NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK TO PROTECT THE- FOSTER KIDS CENTER. OUR CHILDREN GENERAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR OUR PANEL YOUR QUESTION FROM. SENATOR JOHNS THAT THANK YOU SIR TOTAL IS A HI MISTER GREEN STILL BILLS HE'S ON THE CALL. IF I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF- CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR MR GREEN IF HE'S ABLE TO COME BACK ON MISTER GREENE- ONE I AND ALL OF THE PANELISTS YEAR- TESTAMENT IS VERY COMPELLING AND ENLIGHTENING AND I APPRECIATE THAT. MISTER GREENE I WAS PARTICULARLY TAKEN ABACK BY SOME OF THE STATISTICS THAT YOU SHARED I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE. THAT NARRATIVE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AND HOW THE GOVERNMENT BALANCES ITS REACTION TO- COVED NINETEEN AND THEN THE CONDITION OF OUR CHILDREN AT HOME. YOU MENTIONED THAT THE TYPICAL MONTH THERE'S A LEVIN THOUSAND CALLS- OF REPORTING CHILD ABUSE IN IS THAT JUSTIN IN YOUR COUNTY OR IS THAT STATEWIDE. BUT THAT'S LOS ANGELES COUNTY WOW OKAY AND THEN AND THEN YOU SAID THAT THE NEXT MONTH THE FIRST MONTH OF THE OF THE COVE IN LOCK DOWN THAT THAT NUMBER DROPPED IN HALF. WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IT CONTINUE DID STAY AT HALFORD TODAY CONTINUE TO. DECLINE OR WHERE TO GO FROM THERE. SO IT'S FLUCTUATE A LITTLE BIT BUT THE FIRST MONTH WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC DROP RIGHT AFTER HIM. SHUTDOWNS BEGAN OKAY AND YOU KNOW AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY IT WASN'T BECAUSE THERE'S LESS ABUSE AND NEGLECT EXPRESS THERE'S LESS MANDATED REPORTERS LAST HIGHS ON THE CHILDREN. TO REPORT THIS TPE OF ABUSE NEGLECT BY ANI GREW 2100% IN HIM THE SAME THING FROM SENEGAL COUNTIES WELL. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE- SO DID IT ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT DID LEVEL OFF AT ABOUT HALF OR THE NUMBER OF REPORTS CONTINUED TO DO. THE NUMBER OF- CALLS CONTINUED DECLINE BECAUSE THERE'S. LESS AND LESS CONTACT WITH THESE CHILDREN. CORRECT OKAY- THANK YOU AND THEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO KIND OF EXPAND ON. I COULDYOU MENTION IT AND THEN- I DIDN'T QUITE. CATCH EVERYTHING THAT OU'RE SAM I'M A SOUND LIKE IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU WERE SAYING. M. A PARAPHRASE WHAT YOU SAID SO REPEAT BACK TO YOU KNOW CLARIFY TO ME WITH YOU KNOW THE MORE OF THE STORIES. THERE ARE CHILDREN THAT ARE THERE ARE QUALIFIED TO GO BACK INTO INTO THEIR FAMILY'S HOMES EITHER. THEIR GRANDPARENTS OR- AUNTS UNCLES ARE EXTENT OTHER EXTENDED FAMILY BIT. BECAUSE OF THE LOCKDOWNS ARE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO THOSE HOMES IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. S. SO IT. SADLY THE COURTS TO JUVENILE COURTS WERE CLOSED FOR MANY MANY MONTHS MORE THAN SIX MONTHS WHICH CREATED A LOGJAM IN THE COURT SYSTEM SO CHILDREN THAT MAYBE WE'RE READY TO GO ALL WERE ABLE TO THE HOME SO THEY'RE PART OF A BACKLOG IT'S- JUST SAID IN MY COMMENTS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THIS KIND OF LEGAL LIMBO SO THE COURTS THE COURTS SOCIAL WORKERS OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IS STILL CATCHING UP WITH THESE CASES- JUST BECAUSE THERE'S GONNA BE A BACKLOG FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE SO JUST BECAUSE- THE PARENTS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO HAVE THE CHILDREN BACK IN THEIR HOMES OR EVEN- FINALIZE ADOPTIONS. THAT THEY DIDN'T STEP IN THIS KIND OF LEGAL LIMBO FOR MONTHS NOR STILL DIGGING HERSELF OUT- BUT ESSENTIALLY IT'S PUT PERMANENCY FOR A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ON HOLD. BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT. WORKING OUT WITH THIS BACKLOG DID YOU SAY THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. YES AND THAT'S JUST L. A. COUNTY. LAKE COUNTY. HERE WE EXTRAPOLATE FOR THE INTO STATE L. A. COUNTY IS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION CALIFORNIA'S SO. YOU KNOW. WHAT OF THE ORIGINAL GUESS THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION. IT'S A GREAT QUIT YOU KNOW I DON'T THE NUMBERS FOR THE WHOLE STATE BUT I KNOW FOR L. A. COUNTY THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE ONE OF THE LARGEST HOT WATER SYSTEM RIGHT. IN THE COUNTRY SO IT'S A LOT OF TIMES INDICATIVE OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING EITHER WOW MR GREEN THAT'S A VERY TOUCHING THAT'S A PRETTY POWERFUL. STATISTIC IT'S CARE IT'S TERRIFYING FOR ME BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN A SOCIAL RIGHT. IS GIVING FAMILY SERVICES REUNIFIED WITH THEIR FAMILIES SO- YOU KNOW AS I SAID IN LESSONS CAN WE'RE REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE A DIRECTOR LIKE BY THE CABLE WITH A GREAT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. BUT IT'S- BUTTERFLY WHICH ARE BY THE FACT THAT THIS HAS ON CHILDREN- AND THEIR THEIR PERMANENT SHE- YOU KNOW GROWING UP AND HELP THE SUPPORT OF SAFE HOMES. ONE MORE QUESTION I'M SURE I'M SURE WOMAN AND MR GREEN IF YOU'VE GOT THE ANSWER TO THIS SORT OF OPINION THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE THE ANSWER TO THIS OTHER. IS ANYBODY KEEPING STATISTICS. STATE OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAVE- AND LOOK I'M I'M GONNA BE VERY BLUNT HERE AND THAT AND I APOLOGIZE THAT I HAVE TO BE BUT- I'M COMPELLED BY YOUR TESTIMONY. IS ANYBODY TRACKING HOW MANY CHILDREN ARE UNFORTUNATELY HE- PASSING AWAY BECAUSE OF ABUSE OR- EXTENSIVE HOSPITALIZATIONS OR- IF YOU KNOW EXTENSIVE TRAUMA OR INJURY. IS ANYBODY TRACKING THAT SINCE THE LOCKDOWN STARTED. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S A QUESTION DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WHAT IF YOU GOT THE ANSWER YES IF YOU HAVE THE ANSWER I'D LOVE TO HEAR TO INFORM THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE IT THAT'S FINE TOO YEAH SO I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME IT'S RIGHT THE QUESTION I WOULD WANNA GIVE EITHER OR ON SET OF NUMBERS I DON'T HAVE THAT I COULD CERTAINLY GET THAT INFORMATION. AND GET THAT BACK TO YOU BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- REALLY. IMPORTANT QUESTION. MISTER GREENE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF OUR- DOING ANY OTHER. PANELISTS HAPPEN TO KNOW. DANCE THAT QUESTION. HER EVEN RAISING. GESTURES. A CENTER THE- FULL ANSWER I THINK IT'S PROBABLY HELD BY C. B. S. S. WE DO TRACK- ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS ALL OF THE CHILD DEATHS. IN THE COUNTY- ALONG WITH INJURIES OF CHILDREN- AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT- THROUGH THE END OF. OCTOBER BUT WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CHILD DEATHS. THE THING THAT IS VERY APPARENT TO ME I GET ON THE WAR ON EVERY CHILD UNDER EIGHTEEN THAT DIES IN OUR COUNTY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE'VE HAD. CONTACT WITH THEM. WHAT IS COMING OUT. VERY CLEARLY TO ME IS. A PATTERN BOB. MORE OVERDOSES. BY BYE. THAT WE SEEN AND- WE WATCH THAT VERY CLOSELY- WE ALSO HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE SUICIDE RATE. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL ANALYZING VERY CLOSELY BUT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR. THAT WE'RE SEEING- THE- OVERDOSE NASCO ARE. AS AN AS A AND YOU DRIVE A COME- CORRELATION TO THE LOCKDOWNS WITH THE INCREASE. MISINTERPRETS CABLE MR CAN YOU PLEASE ON IT MR CABLE THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU I'M SORRY I LOST THE QUESTION THEIR CENTER IF YOU ASK ME ONE MORE TIME PLEASE SURE YOU DRAW A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE INCREASE IN SUICIDES AND OVERDOSES TO THE LOCKDOWNS. I THINK IT WOULD BE PREMATURE FOR ME TO SAY THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR MENTAL HEALTH COLLEAGUES AND SOME OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT TO LOOK AT THAT ISSUE- I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCIDENTAL BUT I DON'T HAVE. GOOD STATISTICAL DATA TO BACK THAT UP AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT VERY CLOSELY OKAY SO MAYBE THERE'S AN AYE AYE A CAUSATION CORRELATION BUT THERE. YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT THE INCREASE IN OVERDOSE AND SUICIDE DID INCREASE. ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE LOCKDOWNS STARTED. OKAY THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY LOOK THIS IS. THIS IS SOME GUTSY TESTIMONY FROM SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS AND I JUST WANNA TELL THEM ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. MISTER GREENE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO RECEIVE ANY STATISTICS OR ANY OF THE OTHER- POSTED A TESTIFIED I'D BE HAPPY TO RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL TO- STATISTICS ARE TESTIMONY MR GREEN IN PARTICULAR I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN A AND A RECAP OF YOUR TESTIMONY- SO THAT I CAN HAVE IT- AND I THINK MAYBE ALL THIS YOU KNOW MAYBE SHOULD RECEIVE THAT TOO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MR VICE CHAIR WE ALSO HAVE IF YOU CAN WE HAVE A COMMENT OR AN ANSWER POSSIBLY TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU GOT FROM. FROM GREG ROSE SO IF YOU CAN MEET- MR ROSE. IS SEEKING. APART YOU KNOW PRIVATE ANY AND ANY ANSWERS THAT HE MAY HAVE TO THE QUESTIONS A TENER. S. TODAY GREAT THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR WE HAVE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE- THAT APART THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING- ALL OF THEIR INFORMATION ON FATALITIES AND NEAR FATALITIES AS A RESULT OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT. AS R CABLES DESCRIBED WE ARE NOT SEEING A SPECIFIC- SPIKE IN AND FATALITIES AT THIS AT THIS POINT BUTIT SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE THAT THE FATALITY AND IT REQUIRES EITHER THE CHILD WELFARE AGENCY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE CORNER TO ACTUALLY MAKE A DEFINITIVE- STATEMENT THAT THE THAT THE FATALITY. AT AT- AFTER AS A RESULT OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT WITH RESPECT TO NEAR FATALITIES I THINK THAT WAS YOUR OTHER pFATALITIES AND OTHER THE RELATIONSHIP INTENTIONALLY WITH THAT PANDEMIC. AGAIN THAT DATA WE ARE WE ARE ARE ARE. COMES INTO OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES AND WE ARE PROCESSING. DATA I DON'T HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME TOO AND IT WILL BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ABOUT THIS IN IT BOTH THE FATALITIES AND NEAR FATALITIES IN GREATER DETAIL WITH THAT INFORMATION IN FRONT OF US. IN. FRONT OF US ALL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. AND WE ALSO IF YOU COULD PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINE FOR SANDRA WHO ALSO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE ON THE QUESTIONS. HELLO. I CAN HEAR ME I CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- THAT WAS THE IRATE HAND FROM EARLIER BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT OUR CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT THOUGH NOT EVERY COUNTIES- COURT CLOSURES WERE- EITHER WAY LA THE WORK. SO IN KINGS COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WE DID NOT HAVE ACOURT ORDER AT ALL. AND THEREFORE HAVE HAD NO BACKLOG WE'RE EXPERIENCING- INCREASING CASES FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT JUST BASED ON SERVICES BEING AVAILABLE AND BEING ASKED. ARE THERE MORE LIMITED- SO THEREFORE WE HAVE DELAYS IN REUNIFICATION AND WHERE EVEN ON THAT AND WITH NO ACTUAL COURT IMPACT WE'RE SEEING CASES REMAINING IN THE I'M LONGER. AND I DO THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE ANY IMPACT STATEWIDE THAT. THAT WILL REALLY BE A SEPARATE ISSUE COMPARE TO COUNTY WHO HAVE HAD A CORD CLOSURE. IT AND THEREFORE NOT HAVE ALL DATA GALA TO CATCH UP ON THE BACK ON. YOU KNOW WHEN BRIEFLY. ON THE REFERRAL CALL AND HOTLINE CALLS TO OUR COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE NOT EXPERIENCE A 50% DROP. IN THE 21% DROP. BUT THAT IS- WHEN WE CAN COMPARE MONTH TO MONTH- YEAR TO YEAR BECAUSE DURING SUMMER MOST COUNTIES EXPERIENCE THAT DECLINING CALL ANYWAY. THAT THOSE CALLS HAVE THAT DOES DROP OFF AND LEVELED OFF AND AS A MATTER OF FACT IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN NOW AN INCREASED NUMBER OF CALLS OVERALL. AND THEN MORE TECHNICALLY COMPLETED WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN IMMEDIATE CALL WHICH THEN MR GREEN POINT BEING THE NEED FOR SOCIAL WORKERS AN IMMEDIATE INTENSIVE MORE EXPERIENCE LOCAL WORKERS THAT INVESTIGATION R. AGAIN. SOMETIME EVEN WHEN THEY ARE A DROP OFF CALLED IF THE CALL BETTER. THAT ARE HIGH OR LOWER OFF NEED MONEY BUT DOES WE DON'T HAVE- BEING. TO INVEST THE ARE THE ONES ARE OFF MORE THE WORKLOAD AND IMPACT OUR KIDS REALLY. MUCH YOU GET INTO. THE WEEDS OF ALL OF- NEEDLESS TO SAY I WANNA SUPPORT AN ECHO THAT OUR LEVEL OF SOCIAL WORKERS SPECIALLY OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AND INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO. IN YA COME MONTHS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION FROM SENATOR PAN PLEAS FOR NO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE ALL THE PRESENTERS- AND- ONE THING I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE CERTAINLY I APPRECIATE ALL THE TESTIMONY THAT- COVETS BEEN MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT AND OF COURSE- THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THAT- RIGHT NOW WE'VE HAD OVER A MILLION CASES OF COATED IN DE UM. IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT FACT- AND WAY TOO MANY- DEATHS AS WELL AS WELL- FACT- I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT EIGHTEEN NUMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THAT'S A CO THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT RESEARCH ON ACCESS STATS SHOW THAT IT'S EVEN PROBABLY EVEN LARGER THAN THAT SO WE'RE PRETTY UNDERCOUNTING THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DIRECTLY RELATED COLLUDED- BUT PERHAPS THIS IS A JUST A BRIEF QUESTION FOR MISTER- ROSE- WITH DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES- AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE STRUGGLING HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO- IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS TO TRY TO PROVIDE. THE FUNDING FOR THE P. E. AND ACTUALLY THE OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE NEED TO DO WE TALK ABOUT COURTS BEING CLOSED- AS WELL- THE CAN YOU. SPEAK TO. AVAIL OF BILL OF FEDERAL FUNDING. TO HELP SUPPORT OUR- SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM PARTICULAR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- THAT- THAT SORT FOR THE STATE- GIVEN THE OLD. LEASE WE HAD THE CARES ACT BUT HE LACK OF ACTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT- BY IN DC. S. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN I THINK. AND AS YOU NOTED THERE THAT DAY CARES ACT WAS WAS- A MODEST I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE WHAT THE PART IS THAT THE ELEMENT THAT STILL. THE FACT IS THAT THAT THERE IS AN INCREASED FEDERAL STATE SHARING RATIO THE SO CALLED ASK MAP THAT THAT- ALLOWS US TO CLAIM SLIGHTLY MORE FEDERAL FORTY DOLLARS FOR A AND B. WHAT ABOUT OTHERWISE BEEN ABLE TO DO SHORT OF THAT. THERE REALLY HASN'T BEEN AN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES THEY PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THE WAY WE WOULD GO ABOUT THINGS AND SOME AND SOME OF US FROM ALONE ALLOWANCE FOR- SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL BUSINESS SHE- ROUTINES TO- TO. BE DELAYED LITTLE BIT WHAT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF OUR OUR PLANS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT LARGELY. WE HAVE NOT BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF THE SYSTEM IS NOT IN THE RECIPIENT THAT- AGREE DEAL OF FEDERAL FUNDS- FOR THIS PURPOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TESTIMONY IN THAT CERTAINLY I HOPE ARE YOU CAN CALL ON OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- PARTICULARLY- I KNOW THAT THE- CURRENTLY THE U. S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HAS. NOT WANTED TO GIVE MORE FUNDING TO LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS- I HOPE HE WILL CHANGE HIS MIND- AND PERHAPS PRIORITIZE GETTING FUNDING OUT TO THE PEOPLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME- EVEN THIS LAME DUCK SESSION OF THE CONGRESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN- WE ALSO HAVE ONE QUESTION THAT QUESTION AND A COMMENT FROM A SENATOR WIENER WHO IS ON OUR CALL. ANY PLEASE A NEAT CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR BEING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING FIVE TODAY I DO WANT TO START NO- SOMEONE DRIVE FOCUS A LOT ON MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION- WE CERTAINLY- DAMAGE CAUSED BY.

REASONS OR- LCDS ALSO BE TO CHOOSE YOUR FOSTER YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS- ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE ALL SORTS OF. CHALLENGES FOR REASONS WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE TERMS OF OUR SOCIETAL AND TRAGICALLY SOMETIMES. FACILITY TO BE YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO WE- REALLY NEED- LOOK OUT FOR THEM. OPPOSITE FOR US YOUR NEED OUR PHONE SINCE. BETTER HEALTH BE TEACHER YOUR TASTE SPECIFIC. CHALLENGES OF SOME DUE GET ENOUGH. JOIN REMOTE LEARNING OR THEIR OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT WE KNOW ARE ALL MORE POSTS ALL MEMBERS OF. OUR FOSTER IS THE QUESTION THAT RAISES THE- YES THESE KIDS WHO IF THEY ARE A- I'M SUPPORT- HOME ENVIRONMENTS- BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THAT TIME WHERE THEY'RE AWAY FROM HOME. WITH THEIR TEACHERS WHO MIGHT BE MORE SUPPORTER FOR THEIR PEERS AND THEIR CLASSMATES ARE JUST IN THE WORLD AND ABLE TO INTERACT IN A MORE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT TO BALANCE OUT ON THE HOSTILITY THAT THEY MAY BE EXPERIENCED I DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS SOMEBODY. FOSTER PARENTS AND GENERAL EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL. AND THIS STUFF INCREASE THE RISK OF THESE ARE KIDS THEY'RE NOT RECEIVE AS MUCH OF OUT OF HOME. WORDS I GUESS I QUESTION AND IF THE NEXT LISTENING YOU'RE PREFERRED. WANT ONE COMES. ADDRESS ALL ONE REJOICE. WHAT'S OR ARE ALSO. FOSTER YOUTH. THE SEARCH TIME. WHAT ANY OF THE PANELISTS LIKE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON BOTH THE SENATE WINNER. MR ROSE CAN YOU PLEASE ON THE LINE. SURE THANK YOU SENATOR- JUST BRIEFLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS FOR SOME TIME HAD FIRST LGBT ADVISORY GROUP LATER- WE TRANSITIONED INTO SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY EXPRESSION IN YOUR GROUP AND SO WE AND WE RECENTLY HOSTED. ELEVEN ARE THAT HAD OVER FIVE HUNDRED ATTENDEES WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTICULAR- ISSUES RELATED TO L. G. B. T. Q. YEAR IMPOSTER CARE CLEARLY A ONE WEAPON ARE DOES NOT MAKE A SERVICE SYSTEM RESPOND APPROPRIATELY BY IT BUT WE HAVE BEGUN TO. CHIU LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATED TO THIS POPULATION. WITH OUR NEWLY FOUNDED OFFICE IN EQUITY WE PLAN TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COUNTY CALLING THE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO SEE HOW BASTRYKIN CONSERVE- BUSINESS POPULATION I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT. THAT THE- FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS THAT ARE- THAT HAVE WAS READ THAT RECENTLY PASSED THERE WILL BE- THERE'S A KIND OF A AN EVENT TOMORROW KIND OF DONE BAILED AND ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF SPECIAL AND- A NUMBER OF. CONDITIONS AND REQUIRE AND REYES CAN CHANGE WITH AN AD THAT FOCUSED ON APPROPRIATE- TREATMENT SERVICES AND- FOR LGBT. YOUNG PEOPLE AND SO. WE HAD WE'VE HAD WE NEED TO MUCH MORE THAN HALF. WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER AND WE CONTINUED WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR AS I MENTION OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS. THE SERVICE PROVIDER COMMUNITY TO WORK THROUGH THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES- ANYWAY WE CAN'T. THANK YOU THANK YOU ROSE. YOU KNOW I I'D REALLY WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK OUR PANELIST- FOR JOINING US TODAY AND PROVIDING US WITH ALL THE INFORMATION I MEAN I THINK WE ALL LEARNED A LOT TODAY MORE THAN THAN WHAT WE ALREADY KNEW AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF NEED AND- MUCH MORE. IN MANY MORE WAYS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR FOSTER YOUTH- YOU KNOW BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TOP PANEL JUST. WANTED TO. THROW AN IDEA OR THOUGHT OUT- AND THAT BEING AT A YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WORKED ON A BILL THAT WOULD. SET SUICIDE PREVENTION PLANS IT DIDN'T MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH UNFORTUNATELY BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. COULD STILL BE. YOU KNOW CAN STILL BE PUSH SO THAT. WE CAN REALLY TAX. YOU KNOW BEGIN TO TACKLE THE AT THE- THE RISE IN IN- YOU KNOW OVERDOSES AS BEING PART OF FOR. YOU KNOW SUICIDE PREVENTION. AMONGST OUR YOUTH BECAUSE YET CANDIDATES IT'S- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT USE AND THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR VOICES NEED TO BE HEARD AND- AND I JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR SPEAKING UP TODAY. SO MOVING ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL- WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON OUR FOSTER YOUTH. AND OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS LESLIE START HIM- AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISPRONOUNCE YOUR NAME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHILDREN'S YOU AND BUYING. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- I'M LESLIE HIGH MONTHLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER. SO OUR CURRENT CASELOAD IS ABOUT THIRTY NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN. BEFORE I. JUMP INTO MY PREPARED COMMENTS I DID WANT TO QUICKLY ADDRESS ONE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ON THE EARLIER PANEL THEY GOT. A GOOD AMOUNT OF ATTENTION AND WHILE I AGREE WITH MR GREEN'S BOTTOM LINE REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE DELAYS AND THE BACKLOG ON THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IN L. A. COUNTY THE COURT DID NOT COMPLETELY CLOSED. I WOULD HOPE WE COMPLETELY CLOSED FOR TWO DAYS. RATHER WE HAD ONLY A VIRGIN SEE HEARINGS FOR. MOST OF MARCH ALL OF APRIL ALL OF MAY AND INTO JUNE TWENTY SECOND. SO IS NOTA COMPLETE CLOSURE COURT WAS IN SESSION EVERY DAY IT WAS A REDUCED- COURT CALENDAR BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. AND BECAUSE WE COULD NOT. THEY ARE PRESIDING JUDGE DETERMINED THAT WE COULD NOT SAFELY HAVE IN PERSON HEARING SO THEY WERE EIGHT COURT ROOMS THAT WERE OUTSIDE WITH WEBEX IMMEDIATELY. AND THOSE EIGHT COURTROOMS HELD HEARINGS EVERY DAY- AND THAT IS IN PART WHY WE SEE THE NUMBERS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF MORE CASES OPENING THEN CLOSING. AREN'T TYPICALLY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED CASES A MONTH CLOSE AND ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED CASES A MONTH OPEN. DURING MARCH APRIL MAY AND JUNE ALMOST NO CASES CLOSE. AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER FORTY FIVE HUNDRED OPENED- AS A RESULT AND AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD WE HAVE FOUR THOUSAND MORE CHILDREN. IN THE SYSTEM TODAY THAN WE DID- WHEN THE PANDEMIC STARTED. AND THE OTHER UNFORTUNATE IMPACT OF THE CLOSURES WAS THIS VERY SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG. AND THE FACT THAT THE COURT MADE A DECISION TO IMPOSE A SCHEDULE. FOR HEARINGS THAT PUT MANY MANY% HEARINGS ON THE WAY OUT INTO JANUARY FEBRUARY AND MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND SO THAT BACKLOG IS NOT GOING TO BE COMPLETELY ELIMINATED- ANYTIME SOON AND THE IMPACT ON FAMILIES HAS BEEN PROFOUND. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF THE CASE WAS SCHEDULED IN MARCH FOR A REVIEW HEARING OR HEARING WHERE PERHAPS A DECISION WAS GOING TO BE MADE ABOUT LIBERALIZING VISITATION OR CHILD GOING HOME OR TERMINATING REUNIFICATION BECAUSE THE FAMILY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO AND MOVING INTO A PERMANENT PLAN. IF THAT CASE WAS CONTINUED FROM MARCH UNTIL. OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY THAT FAMILY WAS THE LAST TIME THEY WERE IN COURT WAS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO WE DO HAVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THERE THE COURT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THEM I'M NOT SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE COURT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY- WHAT THE SITUATION HAS BEEN. COBIZ CERTAINLY ALTERED THE WAY THAT THE COURTS OPERATE MAGNIFYING SOCIAL AND CLASS BASED INEQUITIES AND SEVERELY IMPACTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND IMPEDING DUE PROCESS. WHILE SOME HAVE BENEFITTED FROM VIRTUAL HEARINGS IT'S MEANT LESS TIME AWAY FROM WORK OR SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION TOP CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. IN SOME USED TO MORE COMFORTABLE AND LESS INTIMIDATED BY THE COURT PROCESS WHEN THEY ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY. MANY OTHERS DO NOT HAVE RELIABLE ACCESSTO THE INTERNET AND THE NEEDED DEVICES IMPLICIT BIAS IS MAGNIFIED AS THE PARTIES ACCESS TO VIRTUAL HEARINGS IS OFTEN DEPENDENT ON THE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. LACK OF PARTICIPATION MAY BE INTERPRETED AS LACK OF INTEREST OR LACK OF COMMITMENT TO REUNIFICATION. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EXTENDS BEYOND JUST PHYSICAL ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET. MEANINGFUL ACCESS ALSO REQUIRES PRACTICAL TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE AND FAMILIARITY TO PARTICIPATE IN COURT VIRTUALLY. OUR ATTORNEYS OFTEN HAVE TO SPEND A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME HELPING A WITNESS LOG ON TO TESTIFY. OR HELPING STRUGGLING CAREGIVER OR CHILD UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONNECT DOWNLOAD OR USE WEBEX. IF IT TAKES TOO LONG THE COURT MAY DECIDE THE WITNESS SHE TESTIFIED BY TELEPHONE WHICH RAISES OTHER ACCESS AND YOU CRISIS ISSUES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAPPENS QUITE FREQUENTLY. ADDITIONALLY OFTENTIMES PARTIES OR WITNESSES MAY SAY THEY PREFERRED TO TESTIFY BY TELEPHONE AGAIN BECAUSE PERHAPS IT'S LESS INTIMIDATING. BUT BUT THAT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE CREDIBILITY OF THE EVIDENCE AND THE ABILITY TO ASSESS THE EVIDENCE. BURCHELL PROCEEDINGS HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE QUALITY RELIABILITY AND CREDIBILITY. OF EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES TO TESTIFY. THE INDICIA OF RELIABILITY THAT COURTS RELY ON TO ASSESS CREDIBILITY OR DRASTICALLY IMPAIRED IMPERSONAL HEARINGS. ARE PRACTICALLY ELIMINATED WHEN PEOPLE TESTIFIED. TESTIFIED BY PHONE. WITH REMOTE TEST IS AND HOW TO IF THE- IN THE RUN WITH ANOTHER PERSON WHO MAY BE. OR EXERTING IN. OR WHETHER LACK OF PRIVACY PREVENTS FULL DISCLOSURE. AND MANAGING A TEAM LIVING IN A GROUP HOME TESTIFYING ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE BUT AFRAID WITH OTHER KIDS IN THE GROUP HOME RIGHT OVER HERE HIS TESTIMONY WHAT WOULD YOU BE COMFORTABLE SHARING. CONNECTIVITY IN SOUND QUALITY VARIES IMPRISONS CHALLENGES TO EVERYONE AS AUDIO MAY CUT OUT THE MIDDLE OF AN ARGUMENT. WHEN THE CONNECTION FAILS DURING THE TRIAL WITNESS TESTIMONIES DISRUPTED. DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AND PROBLEMATIC. YOUR TESTIMONY OFTEN PRECLUDES NONVERBAL CUES SUCH AS EYE CONTACT BODY LANGUAGE THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINE CREDIBILITY DURABLE KEEP CUES SUCH AS WITNESS TOWN OR RESPONSIVENESS TO QUESTIONS MAY ALSO BE JUST STARTED WHENEVER IN VIRTUAL HEARINGS AND IMPACTS CREDIBILITY. HE'S ON THE PHONE HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE JUDGE OR AN ATTORNEY TALKING. CHILDREN ESPECIALLY ALREADY FINE COURT HEARINGS TO BE CONFUSING WHEN THEY'RE ON THE PHONE OR VIRTUALLY IT IS IT IS THAT MUCH MORE CONFUSING AND HARD FOR THEM TO DISTINGUISH FOR EXAMPLE THE SOCIAL WORKERS SPACE FROM OTHER FACES ON THEIR SCREENS. GIVEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT VIRTUAL HEARING SALUTE WILL BE WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND POSSIBLY IN SOME FORM BEYOND THE END OF THE PANDEMIC. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT APPROPRIATE SPACES FOR VIRTUAL TESTIMONY BE CREATED. PARTY WITNESSES MUST BE ABLE TO TESTIFY ALONGSIDE THEIR JOURNEY FROM A SAFE PRIVATE LOCATION. SOME ATTORNEYS ARE MAKING THEIR OFFICES AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE HOWEVER THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE IT WAS AN INAPPROPRIATE BURDEN ON THE ATTORNEY. ESSENTIALLY TO BUILD A VIRTUAL COURTHOUSE FOR THEIR CLIENTS THAT SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. ATTORNEYS LIKE SOCIAL WORKERS ARE UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO CONDUCT VIRTUAL VISITS AND VIRTUAL CLIENT INTERVIEWS. HOWEVER WE'RE FINDING. THAT ESPECIALLY OUR YOUNG CHILDREN OR THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ENGAGING OR STAYING FOCUSED AGAIN THE LACK OF PRIVACY IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING AND OFTEN INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE SERIOUS IN DEPTH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ALLEGATIONS IN THE PETITION OR THE SUBSTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON THE TELEPHONE. AND FRANKLY I'M SORRY IT'S ALSO IN IN IT'S ALSO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BUILD RAPPORT WITH CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD. FRANKLY LIKE MOST OF US YOU THEY'RE ALSO TIRED OF TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE PHONE OR VIRTUALLY AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING TO THERAPISTS VIRTUALLY ARE ON ZERO ALL DAY LONG. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REMEMBER ALL OF THE ADULTS THAT ARE TALKING TO THEM ON THE PHONE OR VIDEO. CHILDREN'S ATTORNEYS AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAVE WORKED HARD TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA THAT VALUE VALUES THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN HAVING MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN THE COURT HEARINGS ARE LIFE CHANGING DECISIONS ARE MADE. IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT STEP BACKWARDS RECORDS TO MAKE SO MANY DECISIONS WITHOUT THEIR PRESENCE. BEST PRACTICES REQUIRES SINCE EVER I NECESSARY SENSE OF URGENCY. BY ALLOWING CHILDREN TO LANGUISH WE'RE UNINTENTIONALLY CAUSING HARM TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. I ALSO WANT IN. RESPONSE TO A QUESTION AND A COMMENT FROM DR CANCEL THE EARLIER PANEL. WHERE HE ASKED ABOUT ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEIR ACCESS TO BP AND THEN THEIR FUTURE ACCESS TO VACCINES. INTERESTINGLY IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH ATTORNEYS INDEPENDENCY COURTS ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL WORKERS BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER. BECAUSE WE ARE FOR THE MOST PART NOT GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WE DO NOT RECEIVE ANY OF THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OTHER SOCIAL WORKERS. AND I WOULD ASK THAT WE CONSIDER GOING FORWARD ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ADDITIONAL ON. TV AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINES WHEN THEY OCCUR. JUST THE SAME AS THE COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WORK FOR THE ATTORNEYS ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY EVERY DAY. VISITING CLIENTS EXPOSING THEMSELVES. TO KOBE- WHEN WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT. VIRTUAL CONVERSATION IS NOT ADEQUATE TO ENSURE CLIENT SAFETY WE ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY IN PEOPLE'S HOMES. MEDIA FOLLOWING TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY TO COPE WITH SAFETY PROCEDURES. BUT STILL PUTTING OURSELVES AT THE SAME LEVEL OF RISK. AS A COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER MIGHT. THE OTHER UP LAST THING I WOULD LIKE TO COME ON. REBATES TO THE IMPACT OF ALL THESE SURVEYS AND THE IN OF A OF IN PERSON CONTACT- WELL I AGREE. WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT WE ALL HAVE TO DO OUR PART I'M IN AS SENATOR LET ME PUT IT THAT THIS IS A LOSE LOSE WE ARE SEEING THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN FOSTER CARE ARE CARRYING MORE OF THE BURDEN OF THAT LOSE LOSE. THAN THAN THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE DEPENDENCY COURTS AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS I CAN MAKE THE CHOICE TO SPEND TIME WITH MY FAMILY I CAN DETERMINE AND-ASSESS THE ATTITUDE THAT THE LEVEL OF RISK THAT I THINK YOU SEE FOR APPROPRIATE FOR MY FAMILY BASED ON OUR HEALTH CONCERNS. I CAN MAKE A DECISION TO GO OUT INTO MY NEIGHBORHOOD PARK AND HAVE THE SOCIAL DISTANCE. COUPLE CAUGHT. WITH A FRIEND FOR MY YOU KNOW ACROSS. THE PARK WHAT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. BUT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN FOSTER CARE DO NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS THEMSELVES. AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL CONTACT. EVEN THOUGH VIRTUAL CONTACT IS BETTER THAN NOTHING IT DOES NOT REPLACE. THE ESSENTIAL PHYSICAL CONTACT ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING ATTACHMENT. TO THEIR PARENTS WHO HOPE TO SOON BECOME THEIR PRIMARY CARE GIVERS AGAIN. WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED. ABOUT THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THAT. ON SAFETY AND WELL BEING- AND SIMPLY GIVING A FAMILY MORE TIME TO RE UNIFY WILL NOT UNDO THE DAMAGE THAT IS DONE. WHEN A NEW MOTHER AND HER INFANT CHILD CANNOT PHYSICALLY SPEND TIME TOGETHER- AND CANNOT HAVE REGULAR. ONGOING C. CITIES CONTACT AND SO. WE ARE- I THINK THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT AREA THAT WE CAN'T SIMPLY JUST SAY WAIT TILL THE PANDEMIC IS OVER IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE. CONSIDERED WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LANDS AND WHETHER OR NOT SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GATHER FOR HOLIDAY. OR GATHER FOR A BUSINESS MEETING BUT INSTEAD GATHERING TOGETHER. TO SUSTAIN THE PARENT CHILD BOND AND ATTACHMENT EXPECTED. OTHER PANELISTS ON THIS ON THIS GROUP WILL SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT. IN MORE DETAIL SO I WILL LEAVE. IT TO THEM AT THIS POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH ARE WE WILL BE MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER AND I JUST WANNA- AT. ONCE AGAIN A PUT OUT THAT WE- WANT TO TRY TO LIMIT AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO THAT TIME FRAME THAT WE SET IN PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING. I JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE. ALLOWING TIME FOR EVERYONE. EVERY SPEAKER OF EACH PANEL TO. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. US WITH INFORMATION. SO MOVING ON WE HAVE JENNIFER RODRIGUEZ JD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE YOUTH LAWCENTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I WANNA START MADAM CHAIR BY SAYING HOW GRATEFUL I AM THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO MAKE. A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL YOU THINK CARE AND PARTICULARLY TO THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST- AS YOU SO BEAUTIFULLY SAID THESE ARE HUGELY CHALLENGING TIMES FOR US ALL. SO MUCH MORE SO FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE RELYING ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT AND PRIORITIZE THEIR NEEDS AND ALL OF THIS FOR A AND DISTRESS- I'M A LAWYER AND AN ADVOCATE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE AND I LIVED OFTEN CATASTROPHIC IMPACT OF BIG AGENCIES FORGETTING. WHAT SEEMED TO THEM LIKE SMALL INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS AND CRISIS HAPPENED. SO WHEN I START BY JUST SAYING THAT FOR YOU CAN FOSTER CARE WE KNOW. THAT WHAT HILLS TRAUMA WHAT BUILDS RESILIENCE AND IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF GROWING UP HEALTHY IS RELATIONSHIPS. RELATIONSHIPS CAN GET US THROUGH JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. AND WITH THE PANDEMIC THE UNIVERSE HAS DEFINITELY DECIDED TO TEST THE LIMITS OF WHAT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ACTUALLY MEANS- INSURING YOUTH ARE LIVING IN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY RECEIVE THE PARENTING BUT NURTURING THE SENSE OF SAFETY AND WHATEVER NORMALCY AS POSSIBLE DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. I JUST HAVE TO BE A PRIORITY. DURING COMBAT. I'M SENATOR WIENER PARTICULARLY FOR THE YOUTH WHO HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY LET DOWN AND HURT THE MOST BY ADULTS AND WHO FACE THE GREATEST CHALLENGES NAVIGATING. THE WORLD- OF THE PANDEMIC SO THAT INCLUDES LGBTQ YOUTH YOU'D HAVE EXPERIENCE COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION YOU HAVE BEEN DUMPED FROM FOSTER CARE IN JUVENILE JUSTICE WE REALLY HAVE TO MAKE A RELATIONSHIP WORK FOR THOSE YOUTH URGENT. I'M TO BEGIN WITH I WANT TO JUST BE REAL MOST OF THE CALL THAT ISSUES THAT HAVE HAD THE GREATEST IMPACT ON YOUTH AND CHILD WELFARE ACTUALLY NOT NEW ISSUES. THEY ARE PRE EXISTING CRACKS AND FAULT LINES THAT. SOMETIMES TURNED INTO CANYONS THAT HAVE NOW BEEN AMPLIFIED SO THAT WE CAN ALL SEE THEM. AND HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO TURN INTO. HUGE CHALLENGES FOR THE SYSTEM- AS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THOSE ISSUES FOR THE APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA USED BETTER LANGUAGE IT LANGUISHING IN CONGREGATE CARE AND SHELTERS. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE YEARS BLACK AND BROWN- DEPRIVED OF PARENTING EXPERIENCING HARMFUL CONDITIONS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT. THIS HUGE NEW RISK A VIRUS OUTBREAK IN THEIR FACILITIES IT'S JUST ONE MORE DANGER- THAT RISK IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE FOR PROBATION SUPERVISED YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF WHOM ARE PLACED IN CONGREGATE CARE. OR WHO HAVE BEEN STUCK IN JUVENILE HALL PENDING PLACEMENT WAITING FOR PROBATION TO FULLY CONSIDER RELEASE HOME OR A FAMILY PLACE AN OPTION. AS A RECENT EXAMPLE ALL OF THE IMPACT ON YOU F CONGER CARE CPAS. ON OF OUT OF CONGREGATE. EARLY IN THE PENTOMIC DOZENS OF PROBATION SUPERVISED. YOU FROM CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PLACED AT CDSS CERTIFIED LAKESIDE ACADEMY IN MICHIGAN HAD TO BE BROUGHT HOME ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS AFTER IN MICHIGAN CHILD WAS KILLED BY A STAFF MEMBER DURING A VIOLENT RESTRAINT. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE VIDEO FOOTAGE FROM APRIL TWENTY NINTH SHOWS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CORNELIUS THROWING A SANDWICH AND THEN BEING BRUTALLY AND VIOLENTLY RESTRAINED BY EMPLOYEES AND TELLY IS NEAR DEATH THANK YOUNG MAN DIED A SHORT TIME LATER. IN THE MONTH BEFORE CORNELIUS IS THAT CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A COMPLAINT THAT LIKES AT LAKESIDE ACADEMY HAD USED IMPROPER RESTRAINTS AND THAT STAFF REGULARLY USE PHYSICAL ABUSE AS PUNISHMENT. DURING THE COURSE OF CDSS THIS INVESTIGATION MICHIGAN LICENSING SUBSTANTIATED TWO COMPLAINTS RELATED TO EXCESSIVE FORCE CDSS HOWEVER I FAILED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE COMPLAINT. THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT M. SIXTEEN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES AND SEVEN STATES THAT ARE CERTIFIED BY CDSS AS MEETING CALIFORNIA LICENSING STANDARDS FOR FOSTER CARE. EVERY CERTIFIED OUT OF STATE FACILITY HAS POLICIES THAT VIOLATE CORE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS THESE FACILITIES CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND FLAGRANT DISREGARD OF CALIFORNIA'S CORPORATE CAPTION FOR FOSTER CHILDREN THESE ARE STILL BASIC LIKE PROHIBITING THE OPERATION OF SECURE FACILITIES REQUIRING A HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT- ENSURING THAT YOUTH ARE FREE FROM ABUSE AND CORPORAL PUNISHMENT ALLOWING YOU TO COMMUNICATE PRIVATELY WITH FAMILY FRIENDS ATTORNEY'S CASE MANAGERS. GIVING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SOCIAL ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT MADAM CHAIR IMPACT OUR STATE HAS CONSISTENTLY ALLOWED CALIFORNIA USED TO REMAIN IN FACILITIES AFTER OTHER STATES HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO PROHIBIT THEIR USE. COVET NINETEEN HAS RESULTED IN LESS OVERSIGHT AND PROTECTION FOR THESE UNITS WHO ARE FAR AWAY FROM HOME FAMILY AND OTHER EYES YOU CAN INSURE THEIR WELLBEING. PROTECTING YOUNG PEOPLE DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING AND STRICT ADHERENCE TO PREVENTION PROTOCOLS THE SITUATION AT LAKESIDE ACADEMY ILLUSTRATES THE LACK OF CARE PROVIDED WITH NEARLY. NO STRONGER OVERSIGHT. SEVERAL THIS CARE FOR YOU HAVE HAD CTHAT OUR DESPITE THE INCREASED RISK DUE TO PET HIM DOWN AND TRY RISK SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS RELAXATION OF IN PERSON VISITATION REQUIREMENTS BY AGENCY PERSONNEL THE SUSPENSION OF THE ANNUAL LICENSING INSPECTIONS AND THE METER ACTION OF CALIFORNIA LICENSING PERSONNEL TO PRIORITIZE ADULT FACILITIES YOU'VE BEEN OUT OF STATE GROUP HOMES ARE RECEIVING LESS OVERSIGHT. RATHER THAN MORE. LASTLY I WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE AND CONSIDERING THE NEED TO REFORM THE SAFETY NET FOR YOU TO ARE AGING OUT OF FOSTER CARE AND LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC AN ECONOMY. TEN YEARS AGO MANY OF THE PARTNERS WHO ARE ON THIS SOON TODAY ADVOCATED SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE PASSAGE OF OUR CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE TO ALLOW EXTENSION OF FOSTER CARE TO AGE TWENTY ONE. AS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN THE NATION TO EXTEND FOSTER CARE AFTER THE FEDERAL LAW WAS ENACTED CALIFORNIA POLICYMAKERS ADVOCATES AND YOU HAVE COMMITTED THAT EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WOULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE. RATHER THAN THREE ADDITIONAL YEARS OF PATCHWORK INEFFECTIVE SERVICES THAT SIMPLY DELAYED THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DIFFICULT TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD THE VISION WAS THAT EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WOULD TRULY BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUTH AND A RADICALLY DIFFERENT WAY. NOW TEN YEARS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION DURING THE HISTORICALLY CHALLENGING A BLEAK MOMENT FOR YOU. IT IS TIME TO REEVALUATE CALIFORNIA'S EXTENDED FOSTER CARE POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION- RECENT RESEARCH IDENTIFIED THAT WERE FAILING IN ONE OF THE COR GOALS AND EXTENDED FOSTER CARE WHICH IS ADDITIONAL TIME TO PRIORITIZE THE LOVING SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR YOUTH THAT WE NOW ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROTECTIVE FACTORS TO IMPROVING YOUTH WELLNESS AND SUCCESS. IN A MOMENT WHERE PANDEMIC THE RESULTING ECONOMIC DEPRESSION AND NATURAL DISASTERS POSE UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES TO THE SAFETY NET OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IT'S URGENT THAT WE ENGAGE IN A DEEP ANALYSIS AROUND WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S FAILING AN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A NEW PLAN AND SUPPORT NET THAT'S TRULY GOING TO OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP RESILIENCY AND SOME FOUNDATION. TO THRIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JENNIFER UP NEXT WE HAVE A MAKAYLA. JAMES STATEWIDE LEGISLATIVE POLICY COORDINATOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION'S. HELLO EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US ATTENDANCE HEARING TODAY- I'VE MENTIONED MY NAME IS JAMES AND I'M THE STATEWIDE POLICY COORDINATOR AT CALIFORNIA YOU CONNECTIONS AND SEE WHAT I SEE AS A YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION THAT STRIVES TO PROMOTE CHANGE THROUGH THAT CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM THROUGH POLICY PRACTICE AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGE. I WOULD LIKE TO START THIS TAX MONEY BY STAYING AT SCHOOL BUT NINETEEN HAS OPERATED OUR DAY TO DAY LIVES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE THE AVERAGE AMERICAN IS GETTING AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE STRUGGLES FOSTER YOUTH IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN FACING FOR DECADES. TODAY WE ALL HAVE LIMITED TO NO ACCESS TO OUR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OUR HOMES TODAY WE ALL PATIENTLY WAIT FOR GUIDANCE TO BE RELEASED THAT ALLOWS US ACCESS TO NORMAL ACTIVITIES. AND TODAY WE ALL WORRY ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE WILL LOOK LIKE IN REGARDS TO OUR HOUSING IN INCOME STABILITY EVERY DAY FOR DECADES THESE HAVE BEEN THE WORRIES IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE MINDS OF FOSTER YOU. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS VITAL TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING A FOSTER YOU ADDS THE WAY SEE OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS HIGHLIGHTED- TOP PRIORITY IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. THE FIRST ONE IS AROUND PLACEMENT STABILITY SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AT C. RIGHT C. PASSED- A BILL AB TWENTY TWO FORTY SEVEN THAT PROMOTED PLACEMENT STABILITY. AND- PROVIDED THAT. NOTE SUPPORT DAYS IT. JIM SIMPLY. IN THE HOME AND RIGHTS THE FRIENDS THAT NEED FOR PRESERVATION STRATEGIES TO TRY TO KEEP THAT PLACEMENT INTACT. IN DURING THE NINETEEN WE ARE SEEN THAT FOURTEEN DAY NOTICES ARE NOT BE AN ISSUE. WE STILL HAVE THE STANDARD SEVEN DAY NOTICE WHICH WAS THAT. GUIDELINES PREVIOUS TO THAT LEGISLATION THAT ARE STILL BEING A STUDENTS- EVEN LASSEN SEVEN DAYS SO THERE'S NO. TRANSITION PERIOD FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THISTIME WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES. ANOTHER PRIORITY THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP HAS BROUGHT UP IS THE NEED FOR ASSISTANCE WITH VIRTUAL LEARNING SO AS WE TRANSITION TO RESUME PLATFORMS IN THE EDUCATIONAL WORLD. AND OFF CAMERA THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RESOURCES OR ACCESS FOR ADDITIONAL HELP RESPONSE TO YOU. THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP IS GREATLY COLLEEN FOR- IN REGARDS TO THAT AS WELL JUST IN ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND THE NEED OF LAPTOPS OR HOT SPOT ACCESS. SO WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF CONVERSATION AROUND FOSTER CLUBBING COUNTY IMPLEMENTATION. OF DISTRIBUTION OF THESE RESOURCES BUT YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ARE HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING. THE POINT PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT ACCESS. AND THERE ISN'T. A HUGE OUT OF REACH OF KNOWING WHERE TO GO OR WHO TO CALL WHEN A YOUNG PERSON IS IN NEED OF THAT. AND ALSO IN THE FOSTER HOMES WE KNOW THAT TRADITIONAL FOSTER HOMES TYPICALLY HAVE MORE THAN ONE. YOUNG PERSON IN THOSE HOUSES AT A TIME AND SO HOT SPOTS GOING OUT FREQUENTLY YOUNG PEOPLE BEING DISCONNECTED FROM THEIR SEEM COURSES AND THEIR MEETINGS- HAS ALSO BEEN A HUGE. BARRIER FOR SOME OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THE LAST TIME I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY GOING TO BE THE CRIME. FOR NEXT THAT ARE MEMBERSHIP BUILDING A AND THAT'S AROUND. REDEFINING MENTAL HEALTH SO THIS IS WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR PRIORITY LIST FOR THIS YEAR. AND BECAUSE OF THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES THE LACK OF SOCIAL INTERACTION IN THE LACK OF ACCESS TO BIOLOGICAL FAMILY. MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT NOW IS A TOP PRIORITY A MORE THAN EVER- OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION THAT WAS POSED BEFORE KOBE BUT NOW IT'S JUST EXACERBATED. AND THAT IS HOW ARE WE HEARING FROM OUR TRAUMA SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES WITH THE EARLY PERIOD SCREENING DETECTION AND TREATMENT. THAT GUIDELINE STATES THAT IS ON THE TREATMENT IS HELPFUL IT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A YOUNG PERSON UNDER TWENTY ONE THAT. FALLS UNDER MEDIKAL IN CALIFORNIA WHAT WE'RE RUNNING INTO IS THE NEED FOR A DIAGNOSIS. IN ORDER. TO GET REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE SERVICES. THE PHARMACY YOUTH EVEN THE CO. WE KNOW YOUNG ARE ALL MISSED. AT A HIGHER RATE THAN ARE NON FOSTER PEERS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN CARRYMULTIPLE DIAGNOSIS IS AND SOMETIMES EVEN CONFLICTING DIAGNOSES THAT. THIS IS BECOMING EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC AND BECAUSE THEY FALL DOWN TO THE SEMANTICS OF NEEDING NOT DIAGNOSIS IN ORDER TO BILL FOR SERVICES THAT WE-KNOW ARE LIFESAVING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IF WE WANT TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF OVERDOSE AND DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SUICIDE SIX SPECIALLY DURING THE TIME. OF THIS PANDEMIC WHEN WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE SKYROCKETING. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CALLING FR AND- I REASON FOR SERVICES TO BE BASED ON TRAUMA AND LET'S LET'S FIND A WAY TO LEAVE BILL TRAUMA OR SERVICES WITHOUT NEEDING TO ATTACH SO MANY MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS IS THAT WE KNOW THE YOUNG PEOPLE CARRIED THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER. REMAINDER OF THEIR LIVES. AND THE LAST THING WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT IS NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS AND THIS TIME IT FEELING WHERE WE- FIND THEIR NEW NORMAL AND HOW DO WE WORK AROUND THE BARRIERS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE OFTENTIMES SPACE AROUND MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. WHEN THEY'RE ASKING FOR THESE ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT. AND NOW I'M GONNA PASS IT OVER TO AN IT TALKS CHRIS TO SHARE BY THEIR EX. AROUND EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS. TRANSITION OUTCOMES IN PARENTING CHALLENGES DURING THE TIME OF COPING THANK YOU. THANK YOU THREE OF THE TASHA'S OF THE POSTER YOU CAN MEMBER FOR CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION LONG BEACH CHAPTER. AND CRISTINA TORRES FORMER FOSTER YOUTH IN MEMBER CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION KERN COUNTY CHAPTER WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS NATASHA SO SAY AND I AM AN E. STATEWIDE MEMBERSHIP COUNCIL CO CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. AT THE END OF FEBRUARY I TURNED EIGHTEEN IN MY COUNTY WORKER EXPLAINS ME THAT SINCE I'VE AGED OUT I WOULD BE RECEIVING A NEW COUNTY WORKER AND MY COURT HEARINGS WILL BE HELD SEPARATELY THAN FROM MY YOUNGER SIBLINGS HOWEVER DUE TO THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC MY HEARINGS HAVE BEEN POSTPONED. AND I'M SEEING THAT USE ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE JUDGE ANYMORE REGARDING THEIR NEEDS AND WANTS. I'M FINDING THAT RATHER THAN HAVING TO ATTORNEY STEP UP AND DO THEIR JOBS THEY'VE BEEN SLACKING OFF AND SITTING ON THINGS INSTEAD OF WRITING REQUEST TO THE JUDGES. THEY NEED TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL TRANSITIONAL PERIOD FOR MANY YEARS. THIS PAST YEAR I GRADUATED FROM LONG BEACH POLYTECHNIC HIGH SCHOOL IN CURRENTLY I'M ATTENDING CAL STATE LONG BEACH MAJORING IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. ACTS NAVIGATE THE CONFUSING PROCESS OF ENROLLMENT AND FINANCIAL AID BY MYSELF. AS AT THIS TIME WE WERE EXPERIENCING QUARANTINE. I HEAR FROM MANY USE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF COMMUNICATION COMING FROM SOCIAL WORKERS AT THIS TIME. IT IS ESPECIALLY INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING FOR THOSE ONLY RECENTLY AGED OUT OF THE SYSTEM LIKE MYSELF. AT THIS POINT WE RECEIVE NEW WORKERS WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP SUPPORTERS NAVIGATE THROUGH IOP. CHANGE SO HOUSING AND SO JUST DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE TO MEET WITH ALL THESE NEW PEOPLE OVER STUDENT WHICH MAY NOT ALWAYS BE THE EASIEST FORM OF COMMUNICATION. SO I'M SEEING THAT IT'S THESE YOUTH- ARE NO LONGER RECEIVING PHONE CALLS ARE NOT BEING VISITED AND THEY GO MONTHS AT A TIME. SIMPLY ALONE IN THEIR DORMS. EVEN THE PEOPLE ARE NOW WORKING FROM HOME WORKERS NEED TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN HANDS ON WITH THEIR YOUTH ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME. ANOTHER BARRIER I'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING THAT CODE HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON ITS IN REGARDS TO MY EDUCATION. UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT CORRECTLY TRAINING THEIR FACULTY AND STAFF TO WORK REMOTELY IN CLASS THERE'S LITTLE TO NO INSTRUCTION NOW THAT WE'VE CONDITION TO BEIG VIRTUAL. THIS SEMESTER ONE OF MY PROFESSORS PROFESSOR STATED THAT THEY'VE BEEN HAVING INTERNET PROBLEMS SO WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE Z. MEETINGS ENTIRE SEMESTER. PEOPLE AREN'T GRASPING HOW IMPORTANT THIS TIME IS FOR YOU MY EDUCATION IS MY LIVELIHOOD AND MY FUTURE DEPENDS ON THIS HOWEVER THEY ARE FAILING US AND FOR THIS REASON I BELIEVE THAT IT IS REALLY DETRIMENTAL THAT TOGETHER WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS. TO DEAL WITH THE BARRIERS THAT THE SPEND AMERICANS CALLING FOR YOU. THANK YOU EVERYONE. THANK YOU NATASHA. AND WE HAVE A LOT. MY NAME IS CHRISTINA TAURUS AND I AM ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA BASED CONNECTION BUT I'M ALSO HE ADVOCATE FOR JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR USE AND I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU GUYS ABOUT. MY EXPERIENCE I AM A FORMER PORTUGUESE- I HAD. I CURRENTLY HAVE THREE KIDS I HAVE ONE WHO IS IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND I HAD TO PUT OFF GOING TO COLLEGE- SO I CAN. HELP HER THROUGH HER CLASS- TEACHER WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO- IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT BECAUSE SHE- HAD A GREAT DOWN. LAST WEEK. SHE OR WHAT WAS GOING ON OUR- IN THE WORK WAY HE. LOOK AT THE TO SEE HOW. TRANSITION FOR HER- YOU'LL ALSO SHE'S NOT AROUND. EIGHT OKAY. TRANSACTION. FOR MORE CRISTINA SPEAKING INTO THE MIKE FROM HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME HEARING YOU SORRY ABOUT THAT. I WAS CURRENTLY PREGNANT AT FIFTEEN HOURS FOSTER CARE AND IT WAS A TO CHANGES GOING FROM A HOME IN TWO CARE HOME SHE AND- AS PARENT EACH TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FOR YOUR KIDS. AND RIGHT NOW. WITH THIS. IT TO DETER TIME FOR ARE YOU KIDS- BECAUSE- THEY'RE SO USED TO BEING AROUND THEIR FRIENDS AND- THEIR TEACHERS AND THEY CAN'T GET THAT ONE ON ONE ACCESS. AND I WANT TO ONE HELP WITH- THEIR TEACHER AND RIGHT NOW- MY DAUGHTER IS HAVING A LITTLE DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE TRANSITION. OF SCHOOL. AND I ACTUALLY HAD TO PUT ALL SCHOOL I WAS CURRENTLY GOING TO SCHOOL. FOR BUSINESS AND SOCIAL WORK. AND SO I HAD TO THE- WAIT A WHOLE I'M WAITING AND NEXT SEMESTER. TO RE ENROLL INTO COLLEGE- BUT IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT TIME AND I JUST THINK THAT. IF THERE WERE SOME SOTOS SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN. HELP WITH OUR YOUNGER GENERATIONS OF THIS TRANSITION. FROMPHYSICAL LEARNING TO THIS VIRTUAL LEARNING- SO THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW. THANK THANK YOU CRISTINA- WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU AND THE TASHA AND THE REST OF THE PANEL OF SPEAKERS OUT PROVIDING US WITH THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DAHLE DID IN THE INSIDE THE ALTAR TODAY- AND MOST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IT WILL DEFINITELY BE HELPFUL TO ALL OF US AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK UP AND TO REACH OUT TO US WE WANT TO BE THERE FOR YOU ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOR YOU. AND SO. YOU KNOW. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL. BUT THESE DO YOU KNOW THESE EXPERIENCES ARE EXACTLY WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY AND IT IS SO NECESSARY FOR US TO HEAR FROM YOU AND- AND DIRECTLY- YOU KNOW THOSE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE SYSTEM AND THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE HERE SO THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR YOUR ADVOCACY. I WANT TO I WANT TO BRING- THE CONVERSATION BACK TO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT AND SO ALL. ALL GO HEAD AND- START WITH ASKING A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND REALLY AIMED AT NATASHA AND- CRISTINA IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SHARE. DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE A REQUEST OR POLICY CHANGE A RECOMMENDATION THAT WOULD HAVE IMPROVED YOUR EXPERIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC OR COULD HELP I HAD YOU KNOW. OTHER FOSTER YOUTH- DURING THIS TIME. THIS IS. FOR THE- NINETEEN FOR SURE YOU. BECAUSE I KNOW THIS ISN'T- THIS IS IN A REALLY HUGE CONVERSATION THAT PEOPLE HAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FAR STRIP OF WASHI- I AM. CURRENTLY I KNOW ABOUT TWO PEOPLE THAT OUR PARENTS IN THE SYSTEM AS OF RIGHT NOW- I THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE I WOULD. LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WOULD BE THERE CAN BE LIKE ANY POSSIBLE. I'M TRYING TO FIND THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE I- MORE. I'M SORRY. I WOULD SAY MORE OPTIONS FOR OUR YOUNGER GENERATIONS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE- WITH OUR YOUNGER YOUTH ENTERING SCHOOL- MAYBE BECAUSE I KNOW SOME SCHOOLS ARE DOING IN PERSON BUT THEY'RE ONLY FOR LIKE TWO HOURS AND TO BE HONEST I DON'T BELIEVE I DON'T THINK THAT'S ENOUGH FOR OUR YOUTH BECAUSE YOUNGER KIDS NEED. THAT INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE THEIR OWN AGE AND I CAN ALREADY SEE THE AFFECTS THAT HAPPENING WITH MY OWN DAUGHTER SO MAYBE IF WE CAN HAVE SOME SORT OF DATE. DAY IS TO WHERE THE KIDS CAN INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER OF COURSE WITH THE SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES AND THE MASK PROTECTIONS IN THE HAND SANITIZING. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE THAT DIFFICULT TO HAVE ACTIVITIES FOR OUR FOR OUR KIDS. TO BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH OTHER KIDS THEIR OWN AGE. SHE. THANK YOU CRISTINA NATASHA WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD TO. YES- WELCOME THAT I EXPERIENCED DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC WAS THAT I RECEIVED A FOURTEEN DAY NOTICE FROM MY FOSTER HOME AND SO I WAS DISPLACED AND JUST DUE TO BEING SUCH LAST MINUTE MY SOCIAL WORKER SAID THAT THE ONLY PLACE THAT THEY HAD OPENED FOR ME AND MY YOUNGER SISTERS WOULD BE IN A SHELTER AND SO MY OLDER BROTHER FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PLACE WE CAN STAY BECAUSE AS YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOU WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN A SHELTER BECAUSE- IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC THAT WAS LIKE A GREAT HOT SPOT AND RATHER THAN SUPPORTING US. IN ADDING STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC WE RECEIVED A FOURTEEN DAY NOTICE AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THOSE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS TO- FIGURE OUT OF PLACE SO. MANY MAKING SURE THAT THE POLICIES WE HAVE SET IN PLACE ARE STILL BEING IMPLEMENTED EVEN THOUGH THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF CHANGES RIGHT NOW. IS IT THAT THIS TIME IT IS. AT THIS TIME IS WHEN YOU NEED. THE MOST SUPPORT NOT MORE OBSTACLES IN THEIR PATH. THANK YOU AYE YOU KNOW IT DEFINITELY- I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION AND JUST YOU KNOW RIGHTFULLY SO AND WE WANT TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. AS FOR OUR OTHER PANELISTS TODAY I WANT TO KNOW- IF ANYONE HAD ANY COMMENT REGARDING THAT IS THERE ANY BEST PRACTICE OR CHANGE RESULTING FROM THE PANDEMIC THE YOU THINK HAS IMPROVED THE WAY THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS OR SOMETHING HOPE WE CAN. KEEP AFTER WE RETURN. BACK TO NORMAL OR POST CODE. AND IF YOU. WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A COMMENT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. CAN YOU PLEASE ON MUTE LESLIE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IJUST IN TERMS OF THINGS THAT ARE WORKING WELL THAT WE CAN KEEP- OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT WHILE VIRTUAL CONTACT WITH CLIENTS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR IN PERSON CONTACT THE ABILITY TO HAVE MORE FREQUENT CONTACT IS A POSITIVES AUGMENTATION SO FOR C. L. C. M. AS AN EXAMPLE WE INTEND. TO I'M INCREASE WHAT WE EXPECT OF OUR STAFF IN TERMS OF HOW FREQUENTLY THEY CONTACT CLIENTS BY USING A COMBINATION% OF VIRTUAL. AND IN PERSON CONTACT ALTHOUGH CURRENTLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED CASELOADS- BECAUSE OF THE BACKLOG AND INCREASED NUMBER OF CLIENTS AND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT ARE OUT DUE TO COPE IT AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT- MAINTAINING THE BASELINE IS. IS PROBABLY THE ALL OF THAT'S REALISTIC- BUT I THINK THAT THIS INCREASE CONTACT MORE FREQUENT CONTACT IS NEVER A BAD IDEA AND IS ALWAYS A BENEFIT AND- NOW THAT. YOU HAVE DEVICES BECAUSE OF DISTANCE LEARNING BECAUSE OF SCHOOL IT IS UCH EASIER TO HAVE THAT VIRTUAL CONTACT AS A FACE TO FACE RATHER THAN- TELEPHONE AND THAT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN ADVANTAGES SOMETHING THAT SHOULD CONTINUE AND SIMILARLY. THE EASE OF HAVING MORE FREQUENT PARENT CONTACT- JR CHILLY AGAIN AS A SUPPLEMENT TO IN PERSON CONTACT NOT AS A REPLACEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK. IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL GOING FORWARD PERHAPS CHANGE EXPECTATIONS. AND MINIMUM EXPECTATIONS AROUND THAT. THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU TO OUR SECOND PANEL YOU KNOW AND WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD TO OUR THIRD PANEL. I BUT YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO JUST- BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE THIRD PANEL WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT BUT JENNIFER RODRIGUEZ SAID EARLIER. AND SHE SAID. SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF A DEEP ANALYSIS THAT WE NEED THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT DEEP ANALYSIS TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR PARAPHRASING AND NOT GETTING IT EXACTLY RIGHT BUT- I THINK THAT SHE'S. ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON- WE NEED TO GET THINGS RIGHT WE NEED TO. DO A DEEP ANALYSIS AND SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR. OUR FOR ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS UP PART OF OUR SECOND PANEL THEY'RE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY.

AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO MEET THE REGULAR STANDARD STANDARDS SET OUT IN MODERN INSTITUTIONS. TO MONEY. AND IF NOT THERE ARE RISK OF HAVING THEIR UNIFICATION SERVICE TERMINATE. AND THEN THEIR PARENTAL RIGHTS. A WHAT A STATE- CAROL IS ACTUALLY LIAR IN THE IS TERMINATED AT SIX WILL OF ON THE HANDFUL STATES. PAUL SAID FARM TEAM SERVICES AT SIX MONTHS AND IF TO COVER CRISIS IS REALLY HIGH. HOW DID THE IT IS OUR CLIENTS IN GENERAL BUT IT'S- NOW TO MAKE SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS IN THAT SHORT OF TIME. AND OUR CLIENTS AND THIS ALSO IS SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATIVE LEADERS BE FAKE WE KNOW THAT OUR TIMES CAN SOMETIMES A PROBLEM WE GET OUT NO FIFTEEN TWO WE WERE ASKED MONTHS HAVE THOSE PROBLEMS SO LET'S FIX THAT REALLY ALLOWS FOR- SERVICES TO BE CONTINUED. THANK YOU TO OUR CALL THE RESTRICTION. DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CODE ON UNIFICATION. WOULD BE EIGHTEEN. EASY SOLUTION WHAT WOULD HELP SO MANY POINTS. ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS DATE WHICH IS IN MOST CASES THE ABSOLUTE DEADLINE WHICH HANDS ARE NEEDED TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF BOSTON CARE. FOR THE STOCK HEARING HAS ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM FOR SO MANY BEHIND WHO ARE FACING EIGHTEEN UPDATE. THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF SERVICES HAVE BEEN. IMPACTED HOLDEN. AND SO WE ARE FACING A SITUATION WHERE COURTS ARE FEELING THE CANCER TIED IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO TERMINATE SERVICES TO COMPLY WITH BOTH CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES DON'T WANT TO BECAUSE COLIN HAS REALLY IMPACTED A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO WHAT I THINK D. R. TREMENDOUSLY. TO OUR COUNTIES ALSO CARRIES ON STATE SUBURBAN SOME LEGISLATIVE GUIDE ABOUT BIRDS CAN TAKE COMMITTEE. ACCOUNT AND PROVIDE OAKLEY. LEGAL STAND AND GUIDELINES ABOUT. WHAT PERRANCE COUNCIL NEEDS TO SHOW FOR TO GET SERVICE EXTEND. WHITE THINGS CAN CONSIDER WHICH TYPICALLY BECAUSE ACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO REUNIFICATION ATHLETES AMONG THE. WE HAVE SOME SORT OF AGAIN TOGETHER FRAME ABOUT WE TURN ARE MAKING ARGUMENT THAT HE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE ABOUT IT OUR COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE IS. THERE IS A HUGE JUST. IN THE OUTCOMES THAT COMING AND SO FOR A LOT OF US ARE GOING TO COURT AND DAY MAKING THE ZERO FIFTEEN REALLY AREN'T. AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET TAX IN OUR- AND WITH OUR AGENTS TO TRY TO MAKE THAT DOING RIGHT BY OUR PARENTS BY CONFLICT MORE CLEAR WHAT. ARM FRAMEWORK- WE ARE TRYING TO FIT SQUARE IN HOLES IN TRYING TO FIT. OUR CURRENT. IN THE CASE BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T ADDRESS.

THE TIME THEY GET TO GET THE EXACT HAVE BEEN JUST COMPLETELY UP AND OKAY AND HOW EVERYONE'S. COUNTY RECENT GREATLY AND TOM. ONE IS THERE ARE OUR CURRENT CLIENTS ASKING ARE NOW BEING LEFT OUT IN THIS. OF TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE FOR SOME. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SOME TOOL- AT MOBILE A MOVE ON TO AND G. SURE. VICE POLICY ADVOCACY ALLIANCE WITH CHILDREN'S. RIGHTS AND AT ONE AGAIN I JUST WANT TO ADD YOU KNOW EMPHASIZED THAT. YOU TO FIVE MINUTE- PER A SPEAKER AND WE'RE JUST YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR FROM ALL OF THE PANELISTS HERE TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS TO SHARE WITH YOU THE IMPACTS OF IN NINETEEN IS HAVING OUR CARE GIVERS. THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC AND CARE GIVERS IS NOT LIMITED TIED RELATIVE. OR NON RELATIVE CHILDREN BUT I WANT TO FOCUS TODAY ON OUR RELATIVES WHO CARE FOR OVER 40% OF OUR STATE'S FOSTER CHILDREN. ARE OFTEN CARING FOR MULTIPLE CHILDREN BECAUSE RELATIVES ARE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE AN ENTIRE SIBLING GROUPS. THESE RELATIVES DUE TO THEIR AGE AND OTHER DISABLING CONDITIONS AREN'T PARTICULAR RISK OF SUFFERING THE MOST DAMAGING IMPACTS OF KIND OF AND- THEY WERE ALSO ALREADY LIKELY TO BE LIVING AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE EACH FOR THE PANDEMIC AND ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS. AND MANY HAVE EXPERIENCED LOST WAGES AND EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THESE CAREGIVERS AND NOW JUGGLING BEING A RESOURCE PARENT EDUCATOR THERAPIST THE SOLICITOR VIRTUAL BUSINESS ALL WHILE TRYING TO HOLD DOWN JOBS KEEP IT ON THE TABLE AND A ROOF OVER EVERYONE'S HAND. AS AN EXAMPLE AMONG OUR CLIENTS IS RELATIVE IS A RELATIVE MAYBE SERRA WHO'S CARING FOR HER COUSIN'S. FIVE SIBLINGS ALL WHO HAVE SPECIALIZED. I PLACE ORDERS WENT INTO EFFECT ALL THAT SUPPORT HAS BEEN MOVED ONLINE LEADING SIR TO SUPPORT FIVE CHILDREN AS THEY TRY TO ENGAGE IN VIRTUAL MODIFY THEIR KEYS AND DISTANCE LEARNING. LAST WEEK SHE REQUIRED SURGERY FURTHER AGGRAVATES HER ABILITY TO KEEP EVERYONE STABLE. THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN FINANCIAL SUPPORT EVEN AS HER SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THREE SCHOOL WHEN THE AUTOMATICALLY. ANOTHER CLIENT ADRIAN HAS BEEN CARING FOR THE YOUTH IN HER CARE FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE HE WAS JUST SEVEN MONTHS OLD. ADRIN IS NOW HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN AND HE HAS ADHD AND REQUIRE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES IT HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY MDIFICATION TO AID. EARNINGS IN ADDITION AS A RESULT OF KIND OF IT ADRIN LOST HER JOB AND BOTH OF HER BROTHERS DIED THIS YEAR INCLUDING THE BROTHER WHO WAS SUPPORTING HER FINANCIALLY. HER CAR'S BEEN REASONS ASTON SHE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET BECAUSE THE FOSTER CARE CASES CLOSED EVEN LASSEN COURT AVAILABLE TO HER. THESE ARE JUST TWO OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES OF THE CHALLENGES ARE CARE GIVERS ARE TRACING. THE STORIES ILLUSTRATE WHAT I THINK IS AN OBVIOUS POINT SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE MEANS SUPPORTING THEIR CAREGIVERS. BUT I MAKE OBVIOUS STATEMENT BECAUSE TODAY THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE DIRECT SUPPORT PROVIDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES THAT KIND OF IT HAS. LAYER UPON OUR FAMILIES. THERE IS THERE BEEN A LOT DANGEROUS TO THE- BUT LITTLE ABOUT RESPOND HAS BEEN DRY SUPPORT PARK GIVERS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN ON THE BULK OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DIVIDED AMONG OUR SCHOOLS. BECAUSE PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS. DESPITE OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO SCHOOLS TO MITIGATE LEARNING LOSS MANY DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS OF THOSE YOU TO SIMPLY CANNOT BENEFIT FROM EDUCATION SEVEN EXCLUSIVELY VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. EVEN DURING HEARINGS ON PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE ALLOWED FOR SMALL IN PERSON COHORT INSTRUCTION MANY DISTRICTS HAVE REFUSED TO OFFER ANY SMALL COHORTS. THE RESULT IS YOU TO A SPECIAL NEEDS ARE LANGUISHING AT HOME UNABLE TO ENGAGE OR A COMPUTER HAVING LOST MONTHS OF SCHOOLING AND BASING MONTHS MORE. SPECIFIC TO RESOURCE FAMILIES THE INDIRECT SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY EXTENDING THE HOT LINES ARE PROVIDING BINDING CONTINUALLY RESOURCE CENTERS. HAS HELPED TO ADDRESS PARTICULAR MOMENTS OF CRISIS FOR THESE FAMILIES BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN A RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL BURDENS AND LAYERED UPON OUR FAMILIES. THE ONLY ADDITIONAL DIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO RESOURCE FAMILIES HAS BEEN IN CASES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO WEAR DIAGNOSIS. FROM CURRENT AND- I THINK I GREW ILLUSTRATE THE END OF THE- TO EXTEND OUR- THOSE. THAT HAVE STOPPED DIRECT. ILLNESS TO ME DOES NOT WE MUST DEVISE A MAC THAT ALLOWS FOR A CARE INTO THAT'S IN OUR- ALTHOUGH THERE'S BEEN MORE OVER THE LAST YEARS TO DEVELOP IN IN A TOOL AS A LOT OF CARE PROTOCOL. TO IDENTIFY THE HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE GIVING FOR CHILDREN SPECIALIZED NEEDS THE PROTOCOL THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED AND IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION WILL DELIVER LITTLE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO FAMILIES TWO YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROTOCOL IN OUR FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES. I SHOWN THAT THE TOOL IS WEIGHTED AND SCORED IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO FAMILIES AND IT'S NOT RELIABLE AND IDENTIFYING CHILDREN WITH HIGH TO NEEDS. IMPLEMENTING THE TOOL THAT RESULTS IN FAST EXTREMELY MINIMAL ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR FAMILIES IS OF LITTLE VALUE IN THIS MOMENT OF CRISIS. OUR FAMILIES DON'T NEED MORE ASSESSMENTS ARE PROCESS BASED UPON THEM THEY NEED. ACTUAL SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE. FINALLY I WANT TO BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR OLDER YOU WE APPRECIATE THE- SOME. THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE BY EXTENDING BENEFITS TO THOSE NON MINOR DEPENDENTS HAVE TURNED TWENTY ONE DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS ACTION PREVENTED HUNDREDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS DURING THIS FISCAL YEAR. BUT IT ALSO MEANS JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE LOOMS AS A CLASS AS THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SET TO LOSE FUNDING ON THE VERY SAME DAY. WITHOUT ADEQUATE TRANSITION PLANNING THIS YEAR WE MAY HAVE SIMPLY POSTPONED THE EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS AS OPPOSED TO HAVING PREVENTED IT. OUR CARE GIVERS IN TRANSITION AGE YOUTH- IN THE EYE OF THE STORM. WELL WE CAN ALL HOPE FOR SOME LEVEL RETURNED TO NORMAL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BACKDATE WHATEVER IT MAY BE IS MONTHS IN THE FUTURE MEANWHILE OUR FAMILIES ARE DEALING WITH THE STRESSORS IN REAL TIME WE MUST RESPOND WITH AN IMMEDIATE INCREASE SUPPORTS. THAT ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS IT IS IMPACTING OUR CARE GIVERS NOT IMPLEMENTATION OF A TOOL THAT PROVIDES ONLY THEORETICAL SUPPORT. THEY ALSO NEED TO INCREASE RESPITE SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS TO ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM THEIR LEARNING. THROUGH SMALL IN PERSON COHORT INSTRUCTION AND IN PERSON TUTORING. AND WE NEED THOUGHTFUL TRANSITION PLANNING TO ENSURE THAT FORMER NON MINOR DEPENDENTS HAVE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION ONCE THE EXTENT AND FUNDING ENDS. INCREASING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THE CARD AT THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANGIE AND- OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DOROTHY DANIELS RESOURCE PARENT LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU A CARE GIVERS PERSPECTIVE ONE THAT LIVES IN THE TRENCHES EVERY DAY BUT IT'S THE LOVING TRENCH AND WE LOVE AND CARING FOR THE CHILDREN IN OUR HOME WE HAVE SIX CHILDREN SO I GAVE BIRTH TO SIX. SIX LEFT OUR HOME AND WE FILLED IT WITH SIX MORE AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF FOSTERING WE HAVE FOSTERED OVER A HUNDRED CHILDREN IN OUR YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE EVER SEEN CARE GIVERS IN SUCH NEED- BECAUSE OF THAT NEED. MY HUSBAND AND I STARTED A GROUP CALLED FOSTERING UNITY IT IS SIMPLY. A GROUP THAT SUPPORTS CARE GIVERS BY CARE GIVERS- WE ARE PARTNERED WITH AMERICORPS. WE HIRED SIX FULL TIME SO UP CARE SERVICE PARTNERS WHO GO OUT EVERY SINGLE DAY AND TAKE CARE OF CARE GIVERS SO THAT THEY DON'T QUIT. THEY KEEP TAKING PLACEMENTS. IT MEANS DON'T HAVE. TO TAKE A- DAY- THE CHANGING PLACEMENT IT'S NOT FAIR BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SUPPORT THE CARE GIVERS SO THAT THEY CAN DO THE BEST JOB THEY CAN. IN MY HOME I HAVE FOUR TEENAGERS SO I HAVE A WELL PRE TEEN AND TEENS I HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD. ELEVEN YEAR OLD A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD FIFTEEN. AND THEN WE ALWAYS HAVE AN EXTRA TWO SPACES FOR TO INFANTS WHO NEED TO LEARN AND BE- A CARED FOR LOVED AND FORMAT THAT IMPORTANT ATTACHMENT. GIVERS NEED TO FEEL HEARD THEY NEED TO FEEL SUPPORTED AND THEY NEED TO FEEL VALUED. WE ARE COUNTING ON THESE CARE GIVERS TO DO EVERYTHING FOR THE SYSTEM I'VE HEARD COUNTLESS PROFESSIONALS AND I HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH GREG ROSEN. ON CDSS AND BOBBY KEGEL IT DCFS THEY ARE OUR PARTNERS ESPECIALLY IN FOSTERING UNITY BUT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT CARING FOR OUR CARE GIVERS. WE HAVE NO MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS WE DO NOW BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH HARBOR UCLA MEN AT A CALL CENTER WE ARE NOW ABLE TO PROVIDE FREE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME STRESSORS. THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS GOING THROUGH. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING- MY FOUR LITTLE ONES THAT I HAVE- ARE ALL SPECIAL NEEDS KIDDOS SO THEY CAME HOME I DON'T KNOW FOR COMPUTERS I DIDN'T HAVE FORCE THAT THEY HAD FOUND IN MY WIFI IS SPOTTY AT BEST. BUT I NEEDED ALL OF A SUDDEN DISTANCE LEARN. I'M NOT I'M- I'M EXPERIENCED HOME SCHOOLER UNLIKE. A LOT OF OUR CARE GIVERS. AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT EVEN FOR ME SO I HAVE A LITTLE ONE WHO OBVIOUSLY HAS TRAUMA EXPERIENCES. AND I CAN FOR SIX YEARS WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN POSTPONED- AND- HE'S ON HIS. DISTANCE LEARNING TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS TEACHERS SAYING IN HIS IN A SPECIAL DAY CLASS SO THERE'S ONLY TWELVE OF THEM. AND HIS TEACHER HOLDS UP A STACK OF PAPERS AN INCH THICK AND SHE SAYS OKAY. GRABBED THE WORKSHEET WITH THE BIRD ON IT. AND THROUGH THESE PAPERS TRYING TO FIND. THE ONE WORKSHEET WITH A BIRD. AND ALL THE OTHER ARE FOR THE BIRD IN THERE HALFWAY THROUGH THE WORKSHEET AND NOW HE'S SAYING I'VE GOT A CHRISTIAN SCHOOL I HATE THIS. NINE YEARS OLD HE NEEDS THIS TRAUMA. HE DOES. WE NEED TO DO BETTER THESE KIDS DON'T HAVE ART THEY DON'T HAVE MUSIC THEY CAN GO OUT WITH THEIR PEERS THEY HAVE NO WAY TO RELEASE THIS TENSION OTHER THAN THE CHARACTER EVER WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN BUT WHO IS NOW DOING SO MANY JOBS THAT THEY'RE TAXED. WRAPAROUND SERVICES I HAVE FOUR OR STEPS OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES. TO MY CHILDREN MAGICALLY GOT WELL AS SOON AS CODES STARTING IN MARCH MID MARCH OH MY GOSH THERE WELL SO THEY CLOSE THE CASE. I HAD TO RE OPEN ROCKET RAP TEAMS. SO NOW INSTEAD OF THE OLD TEAM THAT WE NEW IN PERSON WE HAVE FOR VIRTUAL TEAMS THEY ALSO EACH HAVE ATTORNEYS. AND EACH HAVE- INVESTIGATORS THEY EACH HAVE AGAINST THERAPISTS AND IN MY HOME WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY FOUR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GET ON OUR VIRTUAL SOON EACH DAY ALONG WITH THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING. IT'S NOT WORKING. WE NEED TO DO BETTER. WRAPPING AROUND OUR CARE GIVERS WE NEED TO DO BETTER IF WE WANT THEM TO WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND THEIR KIDS THEN WE NEED TO WRAP AROUNDS AROUND THEM AND I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT POLICIES AND THIS THIS AGENCY NEEDS TO TALK TO THE AGENCY AND WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF BAD AND DCFS IS WAITING TO HEAR FROM CSS AND CSS NEEDS TO HEAR BACK FROM CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF THAT. MEANWHILE DON'T GET TO TELL THEIR CHILDREN THAT WERE WAITING FOR THE MAMMALS WE HAVE TO GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY AND TURN ON THOSE COMPUTERS AND DO THE WORK. AND CARE FOR CHILD. IN SUCH TREMENDOUS MEET. MOST OF THE STATE OF OUR LIVES TO DO THIS RIGHT WE'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN JUST SIMPLY GIVE BACK. SO WE NEED TO DO BETTER CARING FOR CAREGIVERS. VISITATIONS THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUESTHAT I'M HEARING FROM CARE GIVERS AND I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT VISITATIONS TODAY AND I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE ALL WANT REDUCE RESEARCH- OF REUNIFICATION. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR RIGHT TO BLAME FAMILIES I WASN'T HERE TO A DOCTOR EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT GOING TO LIE I WASN'T HERE TO. BE A GUARDIAN BUT I GOT A GUARDIANSHIP OF TWO. BUT WHEN THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WE'RE HERE. BUT WHEN THERE IS FAMILY OUR GOAL IS TO REUNIFY BUT NOT AT THE RISK OF THE CARE GIVERS AND THE FRAGILE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. WE HAVE CARE GIVERS THAT ARE DOING. VISITATIONS IN PERSON. AT AN ABANDONED MALL IN THE CAR. BECAUSE COVE IT HAS PRESENTED US WITH NO OTHER OPTION. THEY'RE NOT GIVEN PP I'M SORRY BUT IT'S JUST NOT GETTING DOWN TO THE CARE GIVERS PARENTS ARE COMING WITH. OUT THE PROPER CARE- THE PROTECTION WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT GETTING PROTECTION FOR THE PARENTS AND AN EDUCATION ON HOW TO SOCIAL DISTANCE I DON'T WANT MY PARENTS NOT TO BE ABLE TO HIDE THEIR ELEVEN MONTH OLD MY GOODNESS THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO WHAT I'M DOING THIS FOR. BUT I DON'T WANT THAT ELEVEN MONTH OLD TO GET SOMETHING BECAUSE THE PARENT HAPPENS TO BE HOMELESS AND I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE'S BEEN AROUND. AND I'M BRINGING THAT BACK TO MY FRAGILE CHILDREN BECAUSE I HAVE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN HERE. WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE PROTOCOLS VERY VERY CLEAR FOR CARE GIVERS AND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU NEED. TO DO ON ANY GIVEN VISITATION. YOUR DIVERSE CONCERNS THEY'RE JUST FRUSTRATED THEY'RE FRUSTRATED. WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS THE VERY PEOPLE THAT ARE YOUR FRONTLINE WE ARE YOUR- FIRST RESPONDERS I HAVE A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR SOCIAL WORKERS WE HAVE. WE HAVE THIS THIS THIS COMMUNITY GROUP THAT TRULY SUPPORT EACH OTHER. BUT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AT GETTING ALL OF THE SERVICES DOWN TO THE CARE GIVERS THEMSELVES. WE HAVE TO TURN ON THE COMPUTER EVERY DAY FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT WE DO IT. CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ON HOLD SINCE MARCH. THEY NEED TIME TO ALLOW THEM TO GROW. LEARNING STOCKTON MARCH THERE ARE MOTIONAL GROWTH STOPPED IN MARCH. IT'S TIME TO STOP WAITING FOR EACH OTHER'S AGENCIES IT'S TIME TO TALK BUILD COMMUNITY REACH OUT TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE US AND LIKE SO MANY OTHERS AND LET'S SERVE THESE KIDS BY SUPPORTING THEIR CAREGIVERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MY HOME MY SIX CHILDREN. AND IN THE END AGAIN THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MUCH DOROTHY ARAMBULA APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR VOICE TODAY AND- WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER AT ITS PART OF THE THIRD PANEL- WE HAVE MARY JO MERE WHO'S A RESOURCE PARENT MENTOR FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND PRESIDENT. OF THE SAN DIEGO FOSTER PARENT ASSOCIATION. WELCOME THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON US SENATOR PER DOLLAR WEN NINE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH SERVICE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- LIKE I SAID I I'VE BEEN FOSTERING I AM THE FOX PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW BUT I'VE BEENFOSTERING TO LIKE ALMOST NINETEEN YEARS AND I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE FUNDING- WHEN I STARTED I TOOK TWIN BOYS TEN YEARS OLD NEVER LIVED TOGETHER- DAY CARE WAS GIVEN RIGHT AWAY LIKE I GOT IT RIGHT AWAY THERE TWENTY SIX NOW THEY'RE MY BOYS ANYWAYS- ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE BRAKES WENT ON TO TAKE CARE FOR FOSTER HOMES. AND THERE WAS NO DAY CARE I AM A SINGLE PARENT AND I HAVE- IT EVERYTHING. IN MY POWER TO KEEP MY KIDS IN DAYCARE. AND THEN I EVEN TAKE ABLE. THAT COULDN'T GET DAY CARE AND I PAID OUT OF POCKET TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD IT. THEN I WANT TO SAY. TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO REGIS CAME ALONG. AND BEFORE BRIDGES I DID STOP TAKING CHILDREN FOR AWHILE BECAUSE IT REALLY GOT FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WHEN WE DIDN'T PUT OUR NAME ON THE LIST FOR CHILD CARE IT WOULD TAKE A YEAR. AND BY THAT TIME THEY WOULD CALL US AND SAY HEY THEY'RE AVAILABLE NOW BUT THAT KID ALREADY MOVED ON SO LIKE IT PROBABLY ONE ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIST AND WAITED. FOR DAYCARE WALL- THEY CALLED MY HOUSE SO BECAUSE MY HOUSE GOT THE CALL IT DOESN'T TRANSFER TO THE OTHER HOUSE SO BASICALLY THE KIDS STARTED OVER WAITING FOR DAY CARE WHICH THEY DO NEED THAT INTERACTION THE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IS STREAMING STREAMING IMPORTANT- THEN ONE WHEN BRIDGES CAME ALONG. I GOT A NEW BORN AGAIN AND SHE DIDN'T GO HOME. AND THEN MOM AND DAD HAD ANOTHER CHILD. SO HERE COMES NUMBER TWO. AMBERGRIS STEPPED RIGHT UP HELP ME OUT AND THEN OF COURSE MY PARENTS DIDN'T STOP THERE THEY HAD ANOTHER CHILD. AND I'M HOME THAT DOES NOT TAKE MULTIPLE CHILDREN. I TOOK THE CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR SAME MOM SAME. DAD WANTED TO KEEP GOING TOGETHER. AND BRIDGES HOW ME WITH THE PROCESS. SO LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT THE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THE RESOURCE PARENTS AND EMERGENCY CARE. I BRIDGES PROGRAM KNOWN AS BRIDGES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. IT'S A KEY SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENT FOR THE KIDDOS AND RESOURCE. REGIS IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN FORTY FIVE COUNTIES WITH A BUDGET OF FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS AS FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN REPRESENTED ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FAMILIES. WHICH WERE SERVED TO THE BRIDGES PROGRAM WHICH IS YOUR EMERGENCY FUNDING WE CALL IT BRIDGES IN SAN DIEGO. LAST YEAR THE FISCAL YEAR 6% OF THE CHILDREN JUST UNDER THREE HUNDRED HOW TO STOP RECEIVING BRIDGES VOUCHERS BECAUSE- THEY HAD THE TWELVE MONTH STATUTORY CAP. IN SAN DIEGO YOU ARE YOU WERE ABLE TO MOVE CHILD CHILDREN QUICKLY ALONG- TERM CARE. BUT WITH COVE IT IT'S IMPACTING THE TRANSITION TIME AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE LOSS OF CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND WHETHER THEY'RE CLOSED FIRMLY ORDER THAT YET THEY RE OPEN. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU GUYS ALLEN. ELEVATE THE NEED FOR MORE FUNDING FOR BRIDGES WHILE THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGES IS AN OPTION OPTIONAL PROGRAM CHILD CARE IS NEEDED STATEWIDE AND JUST SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A PROGRAM OR A LIKE A GROUP HOME BUT IT'S% POLANSKI. THEY TAKE CHILDREN THERE BECAUSE THE CHILD IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION THAT THE PARENT WHATEVER'S HAPPENED TO ON THE CHILD HAS TO GO THERE BEFORE THE INCOME TO HOME OR HOST LEADING TO COME STRAIGHT HOME. IF THAT'S THE CASE THE SENATE POLANSKI WAITING FOR A HOME BECAUSE THE CHILD CARE IS AVAILABLE SO IT'S REALLY REALLY IT'S AT. THE VERY SPECIAL PROGRAM THAT YOU GUYS FUND- IN SAN DIEGO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THE COUNTY JUST EXPANDED THE BRIDGES PROGRAM. TO BE AVAILABLE. FOR CHILDREN SIX TO TWELVE YEARS OLD. SO THE TIMING WAS. BECAUSE OF COVERAGE AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE ALSO SCHOOL AGE. SO IF OUR DIGGERS ARE OPEN THEN IT HELPED A LITTLE BIT. CHALLENGES WITH NEW SOCIAL WORKERS THEIR TRAINING AND SOME OF THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. ABOUT THE BRIDGES OR PROBLEMS. SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY LAKE TRYING TO IT SOUNDS FUNNY BUT THAT FOSTER HOMESACTUALLY CALL THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND EXPLAIN HOW TO GET THE REFERRAL BECAUSE- WE NEED THE REFERRAL BUT THEY MIGHT BE NEW SO THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT- SHARES WE ALSO. I WANT TO ALSO SHARE WITH YOU THE RECORDS OF KEEPING THE SIBLING SETS TOGETHER. AND OUT AND- OUT OF THE COUNTY ISSUES. SOME OF THE STUFF- I ACTUALLY WENT ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE WE HAVE A FACEBOOK PAGE STRICTLY FOR FOSTER HOMES. AND I ASK MY FOSTER HOMES WHAT IT MEANT TO THEM TO HAVE BRIDGES SO I HAVE JUST THERE THERE'S THREE LITTLE COMMENTS- KELSEY SHE SAYS THAT SHE- SHE USES BRIDGES. I WAS IT WAS HUGE AND HELPFUL FOR US. THE ASSISTED WITH FINDING A PLACEMENT THE FUNDING IS IMPORTANT BUT THE- PLACEMENT OF BABIES. WERE IT WAS EVEN MORE SO. EVERY PLACE I CALLED TO FIND A DAYCARE FOR A SIX WEEK OLD TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD NOT SHOULD HAVE. PUT IN ON PUT THEIR NAME ON THE LIST WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WHEN SHE WASN'T PREGNANT BECAUSE THERE FOSTER. RIDGES FOUND PLACEMENT FOR. OUR SIX WEEK OLD TWINS. WE MAY HAVE NOT TAKEN THAT PLACEMENT BUT WE DID TAKE IT- WITHOUT BRIDGES THOUGH- WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE ALL OF OUR FMLA. AND I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A NEW PLACEMENT. IF YOU- NEED MORE DETAIL SHOULD BE MORE HAPPY TO SPEAK UP. ANOTHER PERSON WENDY. SHE SAYS I'D LOVE TO HAVE A FOR THE- IN CANNELLA INCREASE THE A LIMIT. IN LIGHT OF COBIT WE HAVE HAD TEAMS WHO COULDN'T BE HOME ALONE BUT COULDN'T GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE- OF KOBE. AND WITH US WORKING FULL TIME IT WAS SO HARD. WE WERE TURNED DOWN BY BRIDGES BECAUSE- THEY DON'T COVER THE OLDER IDS AND I ASKED HER HOW OLD WERE THE KIDS SHE SAID THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN. WHICH IS PRETTY TRUE IN AND IF YOU HAD A FOSTER KID THIS THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH LIKE A NINE YEAR OLD. THEY THEY DON'T KNOW ALL THEIR BOUNDARIES OR SAFETIES AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT WHEN SHE SAYS THEY GOTTA BE SUPERVISED- AND THEN THERE'S EMILY SHE SAYS. I'M SINGLE AND BECAME A FOSTER PARENT THIS YEAR I BENEFITTED FROM THE BRIDGES PROGRAM. THEY HELP ME FIND DAY CARE FOR THE TWO LITTLE ONES PLACED WITH ME WITHIN TWO WEEKS. THEY ALSO HELP ME FIND A LONG TERM DAY CARE OPTIONS AND A BACKUP OPTION IT COVERT. I COULD NOT HAVE. AND COULD NOT HAVE AND WOULD NOT HAVE BECOME A FOSTER PARENT. WITHOUT THIS SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. SO GOING FORWARD I WOULD LIKE AYE I KNOW BUDGETS. MAY BE TOUGH BUT IF- YOU WOULD. IF YOU WERE TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT ANYWHERE- NEXT YEAR I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER INCREASING THE FUNDING. FOR THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE BRIDGES PROGRAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU- DOROTHEA JUST YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN WANT TO THANK ALL THE- SPEAKERS AS PART OF THE THIRD PANEL- BUT I ALSO WANNA THINK MERIT JOE AND DOROTHY FOR SHARING THEIR PERSONAL% EXPERIENCES. JUST LIKE NATASHA AND CRISTINA STORIES LIKE YOURS. RIGHT THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE- AND- YOU DON'T THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE SO AT THIS MOMENT I'M GOING TO BRING THE CONVERSATION BACK TO- MEMBERS AND- MOBILE. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT FOR THIS BATTLE BUT- NOT SURE IF. ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR QUESTIONS LIKE TIED TO THIS COMMITTEE. PANEL AND I DON'T SEE ANY. OKAY WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR THIRD PANEL ARE FOR YOUR TIME TODAY- AT THIS MOMENT WE WILL BE MOVING BACK TO OUR WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR FOURTH PANEL. FOR FINAL PANEL FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON CERTAIN SUBPOPULATIONS FROM WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR NON MINOR DEPENDENTS AND THOSE YOUTH WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED EXPLOITATION. OUR FIRST SPEAKER HERE TODAY IS AMBER DAVIES MSW FOOT SENIOR DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL PROGRAMS SAVING INNOCENCE. WELCOME AMBER AND FEEL FREE TO. BEGIN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU- MY NAME IS AMBER DAVIES I AM A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER IN THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL PROGRAMS AT THE END OF INNOCENCE HERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND I'M ALSO A FOSTER PARENT SO I DEEPLY AND PERSONALLY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES BEING RAISED HERE- I CURRENTLY OVERSEE THE TEAM ADVOCATES YOU ARE RESPONDING TO COMMERCIALLY SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN OUR YOUNGEST CLIENT IS NINE YEARS OLD AND THE OLDEST IS TWENTY FOUR. WE WERE GOOD MEMBERS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL TEAM TO RESPOND TO CRISIS CALLS ALONGSIDE BOND FOR SENATE SOCIAL WORKERS. WE RESPONDED TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN CRISIS CALLS FOR USE IDENTIFIED AS BEING SLOW. BUT IT ALREADY IN TWENTY TWENTY- WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO PREVIOUS YEARS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE LIMITED BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES AND NOTICED A LOWER NUMBER OF CRISIS CALLED. POLICE WERE CALLED OUT TO RESPOND TO RIGHTS IN OTHER MORE URGENT CONCERNS. SO WE WERE NOT RECEIVING THE SAME NUMBER OF SADDAM'S FORCES CENTER PROTOCOL CALLS WHEN ALL THAT WENT DOWN. SH WE ARE SERVED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHO ARE AT RISK AND IDENTIFIED AS EXPLOITED US US SO FAR IN TWENTY TWENTY- WITH GENEROUS DONORS AND SOME UNDERSERVED. FUNDS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP STEP IN QUICKLY TO ALLOW OUT OF STATE USED TO RETURN HOME. WHEN THEY WERE NOT COUNTY FOUND ACCEPTABLE QUICK ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT A YOUTH RETURNS HOME. SO THE IDEA IS THAT WHEN WE ENCOUNTER USE WHO'S FROM OUT OF STATE. THERE'S USUALLY A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME BEFORE THEY WILL RUN AGAIN AND SO IF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO QUICKLY RELOCATE THEM. WE LIKE TO DO THAT- AND THAT'S USUALLY WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES WILL ASK US TO HELP. IN THAT WAY. THEIR CONTINUES TO BE OUT OF STATE AND OUT OF COUNTY YOUTH TRAFFICKED WITHIN LOS ANGELES AND WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM OR ENSURE ALONGSIDE DCFS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO RETURN SAFELY HOME. SH WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AND HAVE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC A MAJOR HOUSING SHORTAGE. FOR FEAR OF SHELTERS. SURE AND- HELLO OF THE JUST A- CABARET- I MADE USE ASK FOR HOTELS ABOUT AS WELL AS AIRBNB TYPE AS STAYS FOR MANY OF OUR OVER EACH YOU. AS AN AGENT WE HAVE ISSUED MORE BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD ACROSS CLOTHES AND SHE THAT OTHER TIME IN RECENT MEMORY. IN THIS PANDEMIC. WE CURRENTLY ARE PROVIDING OUR PARENT EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM VIRTUALLY WHICH IS SUPPORTING PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED AND- WHAT WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO FACILITATE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN JUVENILE HALL FACILITIES WE ARE CONCERNED THAT MANY EXCITED YOU ARE NOT BEING IDENTIFIED AS THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPLOITATION. SO IN GOING INTO SOME OF THE JUVENILE HALLS EXPLAINING TO THEM SOME OF THE CONVENTIONS THAT- ASPECTS OF EXPLOITATION DAY WERE ABLE TO THAN TO SELF IDENTIFY AND DISCLOSE THAT THEY WERE BEING EXPLOITED AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN AN OPTION. IN THE BEGINNING WE RECOGNIZED A LARGE NUMBER IF YOU TWO ARE CONSIDERED MISSING OR RUNAWAY AND WE KNEW THAT IF YOU CAN USE INITIALLY WERE STAYING WITH EITHER TRAFFICKERS ARE BUYERS. THE YOUTH WHO WERE ABLE TO BE WITH EITHER BIOLOGICAL OR FOSTER FAMILIES SEEM TO BE MORE STABLE OF THOSE WHO ARE IN CARE FACILITIES FOR LESS STABLE MEETING FREQUENTLY ETCETERA. THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE QUARANTINED WITH STRANGERS AND STRUGGLE WITH BEING TRIGGERED. OR BEING STUCK IN A FACILITY. WE CURRENTLY CAN TO MEET WITH YOU THREE TO FACE. ONE ONE OF THE- WITH MASS AND SOCIALLY DISTANT. BUT OFTEN IT'S A COMBINATION OF FACE TO FACE AND VIRTUAL. MANY OF YOU HAVE STATED THAT THEY PREFER IN PERSON MEETING WITH THE ADVOCATES AND STRUGGLED IN THE BEGINNING WITH VIRTUAL PLATFORMS. WE WERE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU WITH GETTING LAPTOPS AND CELLPHONES THROUGH I FOSTER AND OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH GREATLY HELP TO CONTINUE MEETING OUR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. AND VIRTUAL MEETINGS THAT ARE ADVOCATES. HOWEVER MANY USERS CONTINUED TO STRUGGLE WITH ENGAGING OVER. THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS SH WE HAVE SEEN MANY LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF CARE FACILITIES BEING ABLE TO MANAGE CARE AND SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR SEXUALLY EXPLOITED YOU. WE HAVE THE FOR PERSONS ON A PART OF. INCLUDES COUNT AND ONE SUCH CALL WAS FOR IT USED WITH HISTORY OF FOSTER CARE WHO IS BEING EXPLOITED. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIND HER SHE WAS ABLE TO MEET WITH THE ADVOCATE BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO FIND A PLACE FOR TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT. DUE TO SOME OF THE TEMPORARY SHELTER SHELTER CARE FACILITIES BEING EXPOSED TO CONVINCE THAT THEY WERE SHUT DOWN TEMPORARILY OR THEY WERE AT CAPACITY BECAUSE OF THAT. SHE WAS OFFERED TO SPEND THE NIGHT ON THE FLOOR OF THE OFFICE OF DECSS BUT SHE TOLD HER ADVOCATE SHE KNEW HOW SHE GOT HERSELF A HOTEL ROOM. WHICH WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING AND FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF US. THERE WERE SEVERAL NIGHTS WHEN THIS OCCURRED HOWEVER- THERE WERE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND WE FOUND THAT THE TEAM. AND SITUATIONS ARE ADVOCATES EXPERIENCE LIMITS IN ACCESSING USE AND A CARE FACILITY- BECAUSE THEY WERE REFUSED TO. BE ALLOWED TO VISIT AND COME IN AND MEET WITH THEM DUE TO STAFF LIMITATIONS. STATING THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO STERILIZE THE AREAS AFTER THE VISIT EVEN IF THEY WERE OFFERING TO MEET OUTSIDE. YOU CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND MANY ARE NEEDING EXTRA SUPPORT AS MANY WERE ALREADY BEHIND IN THEIR EDUCATION. MANY USERS HAD JOBS AND THOSE ARE THE ONES ARE IMPACTED. AND SO THEN THEY LACKED FUNDS THEY LACKED FOOD ACCESS IN ACCESS TO OTHER RESOURCES. SO THEY WERE CALLING US. AND YOU CAN KEEP AND CARE SUPPORTERS. SEEKING SUPPORT TO PAY BILLS ETCETERA. SEVERAL EXPECTS EXPRESSED TO ME PERSONALLY THAT THEY WERE TEMPTED TO RETURN TO LIFE DUE TO THEIR LACK OF RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. MANY HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO ACCESS THEIR NEEDED MEDICAL CARE AND IF CALLED UPON TO KIDS TO MEET THEM AT CLINICS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT AND ARE ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICAL CARE. IN ADDITION THE LACK OF SOCIAL IN SUPPORT OF CONNECTION CONTINUES TO IMPACT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. A TECHNOLOGIES ARE CABLE STATEMENTS CENTER PANDEMIC STARTED WE'VE EXPERIENCE FOR CURRENT OR FORMER CLIENT DESTITUTE OVERDOSE INTO TO. BESIDES THE DISCONNECTION EITHER FEELING AND REPORTING IS TREMENDOUS WE'RE SEEING THE NEEDS FOR FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER IN HIGH NUMBERS. AND IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE MORE CONNECTION WE ALSO PLAN TO PROVIDE. US VIRTUAL SUPPORT GROUPS AS SURVIVORS NAVIGATE HOLIDAYS GET. DISCONNECTED FROM ANY OF THEIR SUPPORT. IT'S AN WHENEVER POSSIBLE- THAT THE SYSTEMS I USE ACCESS THEIR SUPPORT PEOPLE SOCIAL WORKER PROBATION. AND WATER GOALS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED OF THEIR GOALS ARE DEPENDENT ON ATTAINING VINYL RECORDS JUST CALIFORNIA ID IN ORDER TO OBTAIN JOBS OR FIND EXTRA. GT'S I'M ALSO PERSONALLY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADOPT SOME OF OUR CURRENT EVENTS TO HELP CREATE CONNECTION BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR THE FACE TO FACE AN IN PERSON CONNECTION ON THE CENTRAL FOR HEALING. IF OUR ROLE IS TO HELP STABILIZE YOU TO HELP THEM REACH THEIR GOALS. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW ORDER GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE EXTERNAL THINGS SURGERY ANON AND UNSTABLE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT. SHE HAS HEARD PREVIOUSLY TODAY MANY OF THE ALTERNATIVE CHARACTERS HAS STRUGGLED WITH YOU. STAY FOR A LONG YOUTH INTO THEIR HOMES OR FACILITIES. BASED ON THE RISK TAKING BEHAVIOR. WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR YOUTH AND WORK WITH THEM ON HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES- WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MEET WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW HOW FACILITIES TO SUPPORT THEM. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR SUICIDE AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WITH THE LACK OF OUTSIDE SUPPORT. FOR CHILDREN WHO.

ARE FOSTER YOU'D COME TO US ALREADY TRAUMATIZED AND IT'S VULNERABLE POPULATION HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY KOPET. PADLEY WE EXPERIENCED AN APPLICATION BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. WITH IDLE IDEATION AND RUNAWAYS AND WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT ENCOURAGEMENT AND CRISIS INTERVENTION OUR RESIDENTIAL CARE STAFF AND FOSTER PARENTS FIND THEMSELVES NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPORTING DISTANCE LEARNING AND ARGUED THAT OFTEN STRUGGLE. AND THEY OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES. DISTANCE LEARNING IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND STRESSFUL FOR FOSTER YOUTH. IN ADDITION FOR YOU TO PARTICIPATING IN DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAD SECURE THE REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE MANY FOSTER PARENTS WISHING TO GO ON HOLD DUE TO THE POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS WITH ACCEPTING PLACEMENT. OR THE INABILITY TO MANAGE THE DEMANDS OF DISTANCE LEARNING AND COUPLED WITH THAT IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN NEW FOSTER PARENTS DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT COPAYS. WE HAVE STAFF THAT HAVE NEEDED TO GO ON LEAVE DUE TO SUPPORTING THEIR OWN CHILDREN WITH DISTANCE LEARNING OR DO YOU TAKE THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH CONCERNS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE OVER THE PAST THREE WEEKS WE'VE SEEN MUCH LIKE WE'RE SEEING HROUGHOUT THE STATE NATIONWIDE IN INCREASING COBIT COMPOSERS AND POSITIVE PIECES IN BOTH OUR FOSTER HOMES AND ONE DASH. THE NEED FOR MORE SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN'T. OUR SOCIAL WORKERS STAFF AND FOSTER PARENTS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE SOCIAL WORKERS AND STAFF ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FOSTER YOUTH BUT THEY HAVE TO BALANCE THE HEALTH RISKS TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND OUR FAMILIES AND RENT RESIDENTIAL STAFF NEED MORE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THE NEW EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE THE KIDS NEED TO LEARN.

HER BEST TO USE THE TOOL AND THE WAY TO START PROVIDING THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH-WHAT THEY NEED- DURING RESPITE INTERNET SYSTEMS EVERYTHING THEY NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS TEMPORARY SITUATION BECAUSE IGNORING OUR- I'M THINKING IT WILL. RESOLVE ITSELF IF WE JUST WAIT FOR THE NINE MONTHS- WILL LEAVE A LOT OF DAMAGE WITH THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND THERE'S REALLY NO NEED FOR THAT SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND. THAT WE ADDRESS THAT.
