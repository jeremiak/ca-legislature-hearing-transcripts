CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW ARE HOW

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.092
WELL OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

HEALTHY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:14.067

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.802
AGREE THAT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.971
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS LIKE LOW BANK

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.173
FEES ARE A VOTE BANK THE

ACCOUNTS AND MORTGAGES OR SMALL

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.110
BUSINESS LOANS WITH FAIR RATES

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.378
IS A POSITIVE THING FOR OUR

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.046
CONSTITUENTS. BUT IN TOO MANY

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.615
PLACES ACROSS THE STATE

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.383
ESPECIALLY IN LOWER INCOME

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.118
COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.520
AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.255
CONSTITUENTS DO NOT ENJOY THE

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.490
SAME LEVEL OF ACCESS. AS

00:02:37.557 --> 00:02:38.825
WEALTHIER OR MORE DENSELY

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:42.061
POPULATED AREAS BACK IN THE

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:43.263
NINETEEN SEVEN SEVENTIES THE

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.664
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRY TO

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.632
ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES BY

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:46.799
PASSING THE COMMUNITY

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.202
REINVESTMENT ACT ALSO KNOWN AS

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.870
C. R. EIGHT WHICH ESTABLISHES A

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.039
FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE HOW WELL

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.008
BANKS ARE MEETING THE FINANCIAL

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.209
SERVICES. AND NEEDS OF

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.545
COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY DO

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.747
THIS. NOW WE KNOW THAT C. R. A.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.682
DID NOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS IN

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:07.654
OUR FINANCE. SERVE AND THIS IS

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.888
EVE FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHICH

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:12.125
THEY DO BUSINESS. BUT AS NOTED

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.359
IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.661
IS EVIDENCE THAT THE C. R. A.

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:17.063
HAS EXPANDED ACCESS TO MORTGAGES

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.831
AND SMALL BUSINESS LENDING AND

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.667
LOWER INCOME AREAS AS THE

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.035
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:24.203
LOOKS AT LOOKS TO MODERNIZE THE

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.705
PROGRAM'S REGULATIONS I HOPE

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.240
THAT THE CRA CAN BECOME EVEN

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:29.342
MORE EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING THE

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.010
INTENDED OUTCOMES OF HELPING

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.879
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ONE OF

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.781
THE SHORTFALLS OF THE FEDERAL

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.350
YEAH A HER C. R. A. HOWEVER IS

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.019
THAT IT ONLY COVERS BANKS THIS

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.121
MAY HAVE BEEN REASONABLE IN THE

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.189
NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN IT

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:45.525
DOMINATED THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.927
FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND WE

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.128
HAVE A VARIETY OF COUNCIL

00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:51.197
INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT EVEN

00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.200
ALLOCATED ON HOW WELL THEY ARE

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:54.767
STARVING UNDERSERVED THESE.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.136
INCREDIBLE AND IT MORTGAGE

00:03:57.203 --> 00:03:59.005
COMPANIES AND A GROWING POPPY OF

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:00.740
FINTECH LENDERS. CAN I SEEN THIS

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.942
GAP SEVERAL STATES HAVE ENACTED

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.244
THEIR OWN CRA LAWS IN AN EFFORT

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:06.846
TO ENCOURAGE A BROADER SECTION

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.181
OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.749
INDUSTRY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.985
ALL COMMUNITIES. PIECE FOR A

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:13.620
SUMMARIZE WHAT THE BILL DOES I

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:14.988
WANT TO ADDRESS DIRECTLY ONE OF

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.689
MY MOTIVATIONS FOR STARTING THIS

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.591
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THE

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:20.026
RACIAL WEALTH GAP IS SOMETHING

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.995
THAT A LOT OF US ARE FAMILIAR

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.162
WITH WE UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.365
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT GAP WHETHER

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.599
IT BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.868
MONEY FOR A DOWN PAYMENT ON A

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.137
HOUSE OR MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:32.605
HIGHER STUDENT LOAN DEBT OR HIGH

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.007
INTEREST CREDIT CARD. BUT THERE

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.309
IS ALSO A RACIAL TRUST GAP WHEN

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.644
IT COMES TO INTERFACING WITH

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.412
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.813
TRUST GAP RESULTS FROM DECADES

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.548
OF DISCRIMINATION. DECADES OF

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.150
PEOPLE OF COLOR WALKING INTO

00:04:44.217 --> 00:04:45.618
BANKS AND HEARING DIFFERENT

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.053
THINGS AND BEING TREATED

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.820
DIFFERENTLY. THAN WHITE

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.789
CUSTOMERS. DECADES OF BEING

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:51.858
OFFERED SUB STANDARD PRODUCTS IF

00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:54.193
ANY AT ALL. AND THOSE DECADES OF

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.062
EXPERIENCE NOT JUST OUR OWN

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.463
GENERATION BUT ALSO THE

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.465
GENERATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE US

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.634
ALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE. SHAPES

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.336
OUR PERCEPTIONS TODAY. THE

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:05.738
FEDERAL CRA DOES NOT EXPLICITLY

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:07.173
ACCOUNT FOR RACE AND ETHNICITY

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.508
IN ITS EVALUATION OF BANKS

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:11.044
PERFORMANCES. INSTEAD IT LOOKS

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.112
AT ONLY. IT LOOKS ONLY AT INCOME

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:15.281
LEVELS. BUT WE KNOW THAT INCOME

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.482
ALONE DOES NOT EXPLAIN

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:17.583
DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.686
FINANCIAL SERVICES. EVEN AS OUR

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.320
COMMUNITY HAS MADE PROGRESS IN

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.190
NEARING THE WAGE GAP THE GAP. IN

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:25.692
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE BETWEEN BLACK

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.627
AND WHITE AMERICANS IS NOW THE

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:29.562
SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE THE

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.030
PASSAGE OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT

00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.132
IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AS I

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.168
STATED I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST DO

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.070
MORE IN FIGHTING TO REVERSE SOME

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:39.338
OF THIS HISTORY THIS BILL LAYS

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.541
THE FOUNDATION. FOR OUR STATE

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.109

LENDING DATA TO EXCESS HOW WELL.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.796

UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THIS

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:34.927
BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO

POLICY DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.104

FOR OUR STATE TO ADD THIS

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:47.607

CALIFORNIA. OUR RESEARCH WE HAVE

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:08.961
FOUND THAT NON BANK LENDERS HAVE

00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:09.695
A GREATER PRESENCE IN

BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING

00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:46.932

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.562
DRIVEN BY ALGORITHMS USED BY NON

THINK THE AUTHORS POINT ENTER

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:44.890
COMMENTS- WE'VE HAD AN

00:18:44.957 --> 00:18:47.059
UNFORTUNATE HISTORY OF REDLINING

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:50.095
OF DENYING ACCESS TO CREDIT- AND

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:51.530
WHILE. A LOT OF ECONOMISTS SIT

00:18:51.597 --> 00:18:52.865
BACK IN THEIR IVORY TOWERS AND

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:55.400
POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:56.802
MAKE MORE MONEY. INVESTING IN A

00:18:56.869 --> 00:18:58.837
FOUR ONE K. OR IN SOME KIND OF A

00:18:58.904 --> 00:18:59.738
MUTUAL FUND- THE REALITY IN

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.508
AMERICA. CALIFORNIA IN ORANGE

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:04.343
COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT IS THAT

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:06.512
. PEOPLE TEND TO MAKE MORE MONEY

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:08.046
OFF THEIR HOME. THAT HAVE

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.216
HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS THE NUMBER ONE

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:12.618
PATHWAY TO WEALTH BUILDING- AND

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.152
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY YOU

00:19:14.219 --> 00:19:15.954
CAN TALK TO SOMEBODY. BEHAVIORAL

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.789
ECONOMICS ECONOMISTS ABOUT THAT.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:20.259
BUT THE FACT IS HOMEOWNERSHIP IS

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.628
THE SINGLE. MOST EFFECTIVE AND

00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:23.662
MOST USED PATHWAY TO WEALTH

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.731
BUILDING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:26.698
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES. AND

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:27.766
UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.268
HOUSEHOLDS PARTICULARLY BLACK

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:30.102
AND BROWN AND UNDERSERVED

00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:31.937
COMMUNITIES. HAVE BEEN DENIED

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:35.707
THAT ACCESS TO CREDIT. NOW THAT

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:38.176
BEING SAID I DO THINK THERE A

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.077
LOT OF QUESTIONS OF. PECTIN

00:19:39.144 --> 00:19:39.745
ARRAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.647
REALITY IS A LOT OF THING PEOPLE

00:19:41.713 --> 00:19:42.681
THINK IT HASN'T WORKED AS WELL

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:44.716
AS IT SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE IT

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:45.484
ONLY COVERS DEPOSITORY

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:46.785
INSTITUTIONS. SO BANK OF AMERICA

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:47.853
WHICH IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.421
COMPANY HAS A LOT OF ACTIVITIES

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:50.923
IT COVERS ONLY A SMALL PORTION

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:52.457
THAT COMMITTEES IT ONLY APPLIES

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.293
TO THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN WHICH

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:57.162
THEY HAVE. ACTUAL BRANCHES- SO

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.030
THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:19:58.096 --> 00:19:59.298
HERE A HEALTH ACTIVIST IT

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:00.332
THERE'S ALSO SOME QUESTIONS

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.267
ABOUT HOW THE SHOULD APPLY AT

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:02.935
THE STATE LEVEL. NOW THE REALITY

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:04.836
IS THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

00:20:04.903 --> 00:20:06.538
HIGHLY REGULATED IN THIS COUNTRY

00:20:06.605 --> 00:20:08.206
AND IN THE STATE. MEANWHILE YOU

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:10.375
HAVE A LOT OF NON BANK FINANCE

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.010
COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGING

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.011
ALLOW THE SAME ACTIVITIES THAT

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.680
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THESE TYPES

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:16.882
OF- REGULATIONS- SO I THINK

00:20:16.949 --> 00:20:18.016
THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.084
SCOPE OF COVERAGE WHICH THE

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:21.386
STATE'S YEAR A REQUIREMENT LOOK

00:20:21.453 --> 00:20:23.722
LIKE- SHOULD IT APPLY TO.

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:24.890
DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS SHOULD

00:20:24.957 --> 00:20:26.491
EXTEND THAT ARE WE OVER%

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:27.559
BURDENING DEPOSITORY

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:29.561
INSTITUTIONS OUT WHAT'S THE

00:20:29.628 --> 00:20:30.796
RIGHT BALANCE I DON'T HAVE THE

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:32.331
ANSWERS THESE QUESTIONS I

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:33.799

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.801
YOU'RE LOOKING TO MAKE THIS A

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:36.835
STUDY BILL BECAUSE I THINK THIS

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:38.704
IS A PUBLIC. THE QUESTION. WITH

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.705
A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS

00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:42.207
INVOLVED BUT BUT I WANT TO PLOT

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:42.808
THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK THE

00:20:42.874 --> 00:20:44.343
DIRECTION THIS THE- RECOGNIZING

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:45.510
THE PROBLEM HERE THAT WE HAVE A

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:48.747
LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS. THAT STILL IN

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:49.581
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO OF FIFTY

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:51.350
YEARS AFTER SIERRA WAS ALMOST

00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.118
TWO YEARS AFTER SHERRY WAS

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:54.252
PASSED. FIFTY YEARS AFTER WE

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.554
STARTED RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:56.622
OF REDLINING THEY'RE STEPPING

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.056
CANNOT ACCESS TO CREDIT AND MUCH

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.125
MORE COMPLEX FINANCIAL BERMAN

00:21:00.192 --> 00:21:02.628
SO. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT

00:21:02.694 --> 00:21:04.463
PROBLEM IS WHAT SOME OF THE

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:06.431
SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE IS IMPORTANT

00:21:06.498 --> 00:21:11.169

CREDIT RISK IF YOU INCLUDE THE

00:21:54.613 --> 00:21:55.714
CREDIT RISKS THEN YOU CAN

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:59.284
pWHAT THE LENDERS ARE ARE DOING.

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:00.652

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:08.694
DON'T ACTUALLY GET A ACCURATE

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.862
DATA WHAT WHAT THE RISK IS

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:11.897

WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT DOESN'T

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.190

SOUNDNESS. SO YES AND IN THE

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:57.896

FOLLOWING METRICS YOU HAD OR IT

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.291
WAS POINTED OUT ONE LOAN

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:15.160
APPROVAL RATES BY INCOME AND

00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:17.562
RACE AND BY RACE AND ETHNICITY

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:19.030
TO LOAN COST INCLUDING INTEREST

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:20.665
RATES AND CLOSING COSTS BY

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:22.934
INCOME AND BY RACE. AND

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:24.536
ETHNICITY AND THE MIX OF LOAN

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:27.906
TYPES BY INCOME AND BY RACE AND

00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:29.774
ETHNICITY. AND I THINK THAT- AND

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:31.910
I AND I UNDERSTAND SENATOR DAHLE

00:28:31.976 --> 00:28:33.645
THESE A POINT ABOUT THE FICUS

00:28:33.711 --> 00:28:37.482
SCORE IS THAT WITH IN THESE-

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:39.050
WITHIN THESE- METRICS THAT YOU

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:41.219
WERE REQUESTING. CONTACTS IS

00:28:41.286 --> 00:28:42.087
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THE RISK

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:47.592
FACTOR- OF- OF LENDING- TO HAVE

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:49.627
AN ACCURATE IN MORE IN DEPTH

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:52.530
LOOK INTO- THESE PRACTICES. I

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:53.765
DIDN'T WANNA MAKE A COMMENT

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.101
THOUGH- AND THIS IS WITH REGARDS

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:58.136
TO THE FACT THAT. I ACTUALLY

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:00.472
WORKED IN REAL ESTATE- VERY

00:29:00.538 --> 00:29:03.174
CLOSELY WITH THE MORTGAGE-

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:07.145
LENDING BANKS IN OUR AREA IN MY

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:08.279
REGION- FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS PRIOR

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:09.747
TO COMING TO THE SENATE. ONE OF

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:11.616
THE THINGS THAT I NOTICED AND I

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:13.084
WORKED WITH ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:14.652
AM NOT THE NINE NINE SPANISH

00:29:14.719 --> 00:29:15.687
SPEAKING NIGHT. I DID SERVE A

00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:17.889
LOT OF LET YOU KNOW I FAMILIES

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:19.791
IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.292
THEM INTO HOME OWNERSHIP BECAUSE

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.594
I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.663
CORNERSTONE TO THE AMERICAN

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:26.931
DREAM AND BUILDING WEALTH- BY

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:29.634
ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WHEN I.

00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:31.236
PUT ON THE RECORD HERE IS THAT

00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:33.037
ONE OF THE- FACTORS THAT WE NEED

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.172
TO BE- HONEST ABOUT IS THAT WE

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:36.274
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGRATING

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:38.409
TO THE U. S. THAT DO NOT

00:29:38.476 --> 00:29:39.811
NECESSARILY HAVE FINANCIAL

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:42.614
LITERACY AND THIS IS WHY I'M

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.616
LITERACY. BECAUSE THAT MAKES AN

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:45.950
IMPACT IN THE FINANCIAL

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:47.886
DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE WITH

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.821
REGARDS TO HOW TO PURCHASE A

00:29:49.888 --> 00:29:51.956
HOME I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRST

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:52.624
HAND EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.692
MANY FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS. I

00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:57.896
ACTUALLY FELT COMPELLED TO GIVE

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.764
A LITTLE BIT OF AN INSIDE OF YOU

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.599
KNOW AT THE TIME YOU KNOW MY

00:30:01.666 --> 00:30:03.201
LIMITED INSIGHT INTO FINANCIAL.

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:04.769
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T YOU DON'T

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.804
PURCHASE A HOME USING 50% OF

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.773
YOUR INCOME YOU KNOW I ALWAYS

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.041
SAID. 30% BECAUSE YOU NEED TO

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:11.543
MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE MONEY

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:14.245
THAT YOU PUT ASIDE. REPAIRS IN

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.079
THE HOME- IS A FOR THE FOR

00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:17.749
EMERGENCY SO I GIVE A LITTLE BIT

00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:20.818
OF MY PERSONAL FINANCIAL AS- TOO

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:23.221
MIGHT MAKE MY CLIENTS. AND I

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:24.589
FELT THAT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.658
WERE NOT AWARE. AND THOSE AND

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:28.193
NOT HAVING FINANCIAL LITERACY

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:30.428
DOES AFFECT HOW AND WHAT TO DO

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:32.430
TO MAKE AND HOW IT AFFECTS YOUR

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.199
FICUS SCORE IN THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:35.767
THAT YOU HAVE IN THE LONG TERM.

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:37.702
SO AS WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:38.836
OF COLOR ESPECIALLY WITH THE

00:30:38.903 --> 00:30:42.140
LATINO COMMUNITY THAT I CAN

00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:43.575
PERSONALLY SPEAK FROM- I

00:30:43.641 --> 00:30:46.711
REMEMBER WHEN I. THANKS P.

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.413
TRACKS FROM THE- CAN YOU. WHERE

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:50.248
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE- ESPECIALLY

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:52.183
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.519
LIMITED IN EDUCATION- WE WOULD

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.721
GO TO THE MAIN TRANSIT PROJECTS

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:59.224
TO- BORROW MONEY. OUT LOCALLY

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.525
FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD MATRIX

00:31:00.592 --> 00:31:02.727
REPEAT TRACKS NOT FROM BANKING

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.395
AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:06.364
THEY WOULD BE AT RISK OF BEING

00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:08.032
EXPLOITED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:09.367
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE. COULD

00:31:09.434 --> 00:31:10.935
CHARGE WHATEVER THAT WAS BUT IT

00:31:11.002 --> 00:31:12.937
WAS THE NLY WAY THAT THEY WOULD

00:31:13.004 --> 00:31:16.908
HAVE ACCESS TO. TO TO FINANCIAL-

00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:19.677
CAPITAL SO- THIS IS NOT UNIQUE

00:31:19.744 --> 00:31:21.446
TO THE UNITED STATES IT HAPPENS

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:22.747
THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA AND I'M

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:25.250
SURE IT GOES THROUGH OUT- THE

00:31:25.316 --> 00:31:27.785
WORLD. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:28.820
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:30.421
SPECIALLY AS WE HAVE MIGRAINES

00:31:30.488 --> 00:31:32.523
COMING INTO OUR- COUNTRY IS TO

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:35.026
MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYONE HAS TO

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:36.761
ENSURE LITERACY I WISH IT WAS A

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:38.229
REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO GRADUATE

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.797
FROM HIGH SCHOOL. I WISH IT WAS

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.165
A REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO GRADUATE

00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:43.134
FROM COLLEGE- SPECIALLY AS A

00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.569
FRESHMAN WHEN YOU'RE- MAKING

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:47.038
DECISIONS. ON THE LOANS THAT

00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:51.709
YOU'RE GOING TO BE- YOU KNOW.

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.778
BEING OFF ON. C. ISN'T. TO

00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.680
ECONOMIC. AND EMPOWER. AND WE

00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:57.515
NEED TO START FOCUSING ON THAT

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:58.683
PART SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE THE

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.718
BEST BEST WISE CHOICES ON THEIR

00:32:00.785 --> 00:32:02.420
BEHALF SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.088

MY FIRST BUSINESS AND IT WAS IT

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:27.578
WAS BECAUSE OF WHERE I LIVED

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:28.813
RIGHT FRANKLY AND BECAUSE THE

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.715
MEDIAN INCOME IN MY COMMUNITY

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.383

THE DATA BACK AND I HAD MY SCORE

00:32:51.703 --> 00:32:53.571
WHICH WAS PERFECT AND BECAUSE OF

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.440
WHERE I LIVE IS WHY THEY DENIED

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:58.276

A GOTCHA BILL BECAUSE IT HAPPENS

00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.529
SO WE GET THE DATA WE SHOW THAT

00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:20.631
THERE ARE. INSTITUTIONS THAT

00:33:20.698 --> 00:33:21.733
DON'T GOING TO COMMUNITIES

00:33:21.799 --> 00:33:23.801
BECAUSE OF THEY CAN JUST BROADLY

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:26.771
LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.106
THERE AND THE MEDIAN INCOME THAT

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.574
COMES IN AND THEY DON'T WANT TO

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.743
GO IN THERE BECAUSE OF BECAUSE

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:32.710

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.884
KNOW IF THIS. AS IT MOVES FOR.

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:42.019
BUT WE CAN ALSO. TELL YOU KNOW

00:33:42.086 --> 00:33:44.722
WE TALK MORE ABOUT. HOW DF PI

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:49.093
WOULD CREATE THAT ANALYSIS AND-SO. IT IS. I THINK. SINCE WE

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.661
STARTED WE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD.

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:53.297
THAT YOUR CREDIT SCORE IS PART

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:55.400
OF THE REASON THAT YOU MAY BE.

00:33:55.466 --> 00:33:57.668
GIVEN OR DENIED A PRODUCT AND SO

00:33:57.735 --> 00:33:59.904
IT'S NOT TO EXCLUDE THIS. BUT I

00:33:59.971 --> 00:34:01.606
THINK YOU KNOW FOR ME AS AS I

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:03.708
LOOK AT THIS BILL. AND EIGHT IN

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:04.876
A HERE YOU KNOW REALLY THAT THE

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.778
VARIETY OF COMMENTS FROM ALL OF

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.812
US WHO ARE FROM VERY DIFFERENT

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:10.114
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WE- ALL

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.916
RECOGNIZE- AND I THINK AND I

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:12.550
REALLY HOPE THAT THIS IS.

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:14.018
SOMETHING THAT THAT COMES OUT OF

00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.053
THIS WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.122
ARE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS AND HOW.

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:20.358
THINGS ARE WORKING WE ALL HAVE A

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.059
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FROM WHAT

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:24.796
I'VE HEARD. IN RELATION TO THIS

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:26.097
WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE. LIKE WHAT

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.832
YOU GET TONIGHT WHY DO YOU GET

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.801
THIS HOW'S IT GOING. BUT ALSO A

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:31.836
THE A THING TO WHAT THE VICE

00:34:31.903 --> 00:34:33.070
CHAIR HAS MENTIONED. IT CREATES

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:35.473
A TRUST WHO YOU LEARN FROM YOU

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.443
HAVE TO TRUST. YOU OR SOMEONE

00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:39.944
THAT YOUR CLIENTS TRUSTED TO

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.379
HELP AND GUIDE THROUGH. AND SO

00:34:41.446 --> 00:34:42.880
THIS IS PART. AFTER YOU'VE

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:44.449
TALKED ABOUT GENERATIONS BEFORE

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:46.884
IS NOT GOING TO BANKS. RIGHT AND

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:47.718
SO IT'S PART OF A HISTORY THAT

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:50.388
WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE. AND HOW

00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:51.155
DO YOU CHANGE A HISTORY WHERE

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.690
THERE HASN'T BEEN THAT TRUST-

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.258
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE.

00:34:54.325 --> 00:34:55.393
WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.328
INFORMATION PUBLICLY THAT SAYS

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.263
BOTH WHERE IT'S WORKING AND MEET

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.231
YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S WORKING

00:35:00.298 --> 00:35:02.266
WHERE IT'S NOT WORKING. I

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:03.568
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PLACES

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:05.136
WHERE IT'S WORKING BETTER AND I

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.738
WANT TO KNOW WHY. AND I WANT TO

00:35:07.805 --> 00:35:09.707
KNOW HOW WILL COME IT'S WORKING

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.676
BETTER THERE WHAT HAPPENED WHICH

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:13.277
CHANGED. WHAT DID THE FINANCED

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.679
INSTITUTIONS DO DIFFERENTLY

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:16.981
BECAUSE THE LANDING YOU KNOW AND

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.416
THE SERVICES TO OUR

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.417
UNDERREPRESENTED FOLKS AND AGAIN

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:20.952
UNDER REPRESENTED FOLKS. IT'S

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:22.186
JUST THAT THIS CITY IT'S ALSO

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:23.654
RURAL AREAS RIGHT.

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.156
UNDERREPRESENTED FOLKS IS BETTER

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:27.291
BUT I ALSO LEARNED A WEEK. WE'VE

00:35:27.358 --> 00:35:29.694
KNOWN FOR DECADES. THAT THIS

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.295
ISN'T WORKING IN SOME

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:31.929
COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S STILL NOT

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:34.799
WORKING. WHY AFTER DECADES ISN'T

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:37.535
THIS WORKING AND SO OF COURSE TO

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:40.905
ANSWER THE WHY. OR WILL ALWAYS

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.107
BE. SO WILL OTHER ELLA RIGHT WE

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:44.141
NEED TO ANSWER THE WHY AND SO

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:45.877
FOR ME YOU KNOW YOU MOST OF YOU

00:35:45.943 --> 00:35:48.679
KNOW I STARTED THIS BILL- AND IT

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.249
WAS TO CREATE A STATE CRA AND WE

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.650
GOT A LOT OF OPPOSITION FROM THE

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.952
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ST WE

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.722
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A PROGRAM

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.290
IN THE STATE THAT AUTOMATICALLY

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:00.925
DOES THIS AND I THOUGHT. WELL

00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:02.593
WHY WHY DON'T WE WANT TO CREATE

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.128
THIS RIGHT- WHAT ARE THE

00:36:04.195 --> 00:36:06.330
ELEMENTS- ISN'T THAT STOP THIS

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.666
BUT I ALSO WANT TO DO SOMETHING-

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:10.468
THAT MOVES US FORWARD AND HAS

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:12.036
THE EVIDENCE I'VE WORKED YOU

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:13.638
KNOW WITH THE BANKING YOU KNOW

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.239
COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.507
FOR SOMETIME AND I KNOW THAT

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.942
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.411
ALSO BRING YOU ALL EVIDENCE- IN

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.213
TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOT

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.614
JUST BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD OR

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:26.484
SOUNDS GOOD. SO FOR ME THIS IS

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.719
PART OF A GREAT PTION OF IF WE

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:31.122
HAVE OF RECENT DATA THAT LOOKS

00:36:31.188 --> 00:36:33.357
AT CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC NOT JUST

00:36:33.424 --> 00:36:35.493
AT OTHER STATES RIGHT AND WHAT'S

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.562
HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES WE CAN

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:38.829
BETTER UNDERSTAND AND MOVE

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:41.799
FORWARD AND AGAIN WE THEN THE

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:45.536
NOTION THAT IT'S JUST BANKS IS-

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:47.605
IT. IS A CAT YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:49.106
WE SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:49.907
USING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THERE'S

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:50.708
ONLINE PRODUCTS THERE'S

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:52.977
DIFFERENT LENDING PRODUCTS- WE

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.412
HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:55.079
TRADITIONAL BANKS COMMUNITY

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:57.248
BANKS CREDIT UNIONS. WE WANT TO

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:58.683
KNOW HOW THEY'RE ALL DOING WORK

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.551
RIGHT AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.453
SEE IF IN THE STATE THERE'S A

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.955
WAY TO REPLICATE WHEN IT WORKS

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.790
AND ALSO TO SAY LOOK. THIS

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:07.258
HASN'T WORKED FOR DECADES SO

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:11.262
THIS BILL- EASE PART OF I THINK

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.464
A PIECE OF EVIDENCE- THAT WILL

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:16.200
BE COLLECTED TO INFORM.

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:18.669
DECISIONS AND THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:20.271
CREATE A DECISION IT DOESN'T

00:37:20.338 --> 00:37:23.841
CREATE A VERDICT BUT IT DOES SAY

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:24.575
WE'RE GOING TO COLLECT THIS

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:25.743
INFORMATION. AND SET. A BILL

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.745
MOVES FORWARD ON THE FIGHT GO

00:37:27.812 --> 00:37:29.447
SCORE ON THE CREDIT HISTORY YOU

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:30.615
KNOW CERTAINLY WE CAN KIND OF AT

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:34.585
AMP IT UP AND TALK MORE ABOUT IT

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:37.121
IN EXPLICITLY POINT OUT WHERE IT

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.155
SAYS WHAT- YEAH I CAN BE. IT'S

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:40.324
ALWAYS BEEN PART OF ANY QUESTION

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.226
TO UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS CAN

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:45.363
SHAPE. FOR ALL OF OUR

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.364
CONSTITUENTS NO MATTER WHERE

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.833
THEY'RE AT- BETTER YOU KNOW

00:37:48.899 --> 00:37:49.967
SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:53.504
LENDING- IN YOU KNOW AS A FIRST

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:55.873
GENERATION- YOU KNOW. BUT THE

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:58.075
INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME YOU KNOW

00:37:58.142 --> 00:37:59.677
WHOSE PARENTS ARE IMMIGRANTS- I

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.579
MEAN IT'S THE HOMEOWNERSHIP

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:04.315
WHICH IS NOT LIKE THIS IS NOT

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:04.915
JUST FOCUSED ON THAT I WANT TO

00:38:04.982 --> 00:38:06.651
BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. WE I

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:10.621
GET IT I FEEL IT I UNDERSTAND-

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:13.991
THAT YOU KNOW FOR MANY- NOT

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:17.628
BEING NOT ABLE NOT BEING ABLE TO

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.463
QUALIFY FOR A HOME. MEANS YOU

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.000
ARE. FROM AXIS IN A BIG WAY AND-

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.669
YOU KNOW THE NEXT LEVEL I THINK

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:26.003
IS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:27.538
WHERE DID THEY GET RIGHT THE

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:29.540
LOAN AND CAN THEY DO YOU KNOW DO

00:38:29.607 --> 00:38:31.142
THAT TOO BUT FOR ALL OF THESE

00:38:31.208 --> 00:38:32.576
THINGS MEAN SOMETHING FOR THE

00:38:32.643 --> 00:38:34.412
WEALTH WE BUILD- DON'T BUILD-

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:36.647
HERE. IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS

00:38:36.714 --> 00:38:37.848
COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.750
IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.652
EQUITABLE ACCESS BUT THAT EQUITY

00:38:41.719 --> 00:38:44.355
ALSO MEANS WE LOOK AT EVERYONE'S

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:45.956
YOU KNOW BACKGROUND- AND THEIR

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:48.559
BELIEVE. ME BUT IT. I MEAN

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:50.361
THERE'S JUST SOME TRENDS IN SOME

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:51.929
HISTORY THAT DON'T ADD UP. AND

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:53.364
THEY'RE BASED ON. RACE AND

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:55.433
ETHNICITY AND THEY JUST DON'T.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:57.468
AND THIS IS WHY AGAIN I DON'T

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.170
WANT TO REPEAT THE HISTORY BUT

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:01.205
IT IS- IT IS A HISTORY THAT IS

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.541
PART. OF THIS INDUSTRY AND I

00:39:03.607 --> 00:39:05.176
THINK ELECTIVELY WE WANT TO

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:08.212
CHANGE THAT I BLIEVE THAT OUR

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:08.779
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DON'T

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:12.550
WANT. THAT HISTORY. BUT WE HAVE

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:15.186
TO ALSO. ABOUT WHAT EXIST. I'M

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:16.987
ONE LAST QUESTION ON FOR MY-

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:18.456
GRANDCHILDREN AND MY COLLEAGUES

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.491
BUT JUST ON MY ON MY BEHALF. IS

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:21.892
THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY THAT WITH

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.994
IN THIS DATA COLLECTION OR

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:26.030
STUDIES- ONCE WE START

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:27.398
INTERPRETING AND ANALYZING THE

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:29.333
DATA. COULD THERE BE A COMPONENT

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.469
THERE OF- FINANCIAL LITERACY

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.270
UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE I THINK

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.873
THAT ALSO. HAS AN IMPACT AS I

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.074
MENTIONED EARLIER ON YOUR FIVE

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:39.510
GOALS SCORED IN THE RISK FACTOR

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.579
AND I THINK THAT WOULD ALSO GIVE

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:43.714
A MORE IN DEPTH LOOK ASKED TO.

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:45.916
NOT JUST THE RACE AND ETHNICITY

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:48.085
BUT ALSO ON THE DECISION MAKING

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.720
OVERALL AND I THINK THAT COULD

00:39:49.787 --> 00:39:53.991
BE A UNIFORM- YOU KNOW NINE

00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:57.394
COLOR NON- RACED- MORE OF A

00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:01.031
NEUTRAL. FACTOR IN ALSO TRYING

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.934
TO ANALYZE THIS DATA IT JUST.

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.770
I'M NOT SURE IF IT CAN BE PLACED

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:06.704
IN THIS PART- IT WHERE IT COULD

00:40:06.771 --> 00:40:08.973
BE BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:11.108
THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY. IS A

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:13.410
HUGE COMPONENT INTO HOW WE MAKE

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.712
DECISIONS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:16.413
OUR HIGH I PIKO SCORES WHAT TYPE

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.415
OF PRODUCTS WE QUALIFY FOR AS

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:21.452
WELL AS- THE INTEREST RATES THAT

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:23.454
WE PAY OF THOSE AND SO. I JUST

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.156
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AT SOME.

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:28.092
HOW SOME AT SOME LEVEL WE MAY

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:28.959
WANNA START ASKING THOSE

00:40:29.026 --> 00:40:31.695
QUESTIONS- BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:33.631
AN IMPACT SPECIALLY IF YOU'RE-

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:35.199
AN IMMIGRANT OR SOMEONE WHO'S

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:37.468
MIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY- THAT

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.436
THAT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:41.572
YOUR- YOUR FIGHT GO SCORES AND

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.873
YOUR ABILITY TO. NOT TALK ABOUT

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:45.075
THE RULING AS BUT THAT COULD BE

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:46.644
ALSO IN THERE BUT I THINK THAT

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.479
IS JUST ONE NEUTRAL FACTOR THAT

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.648
COULD REALLY AFFECT- THE DATA.

00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:52.149
INTERPRET THE DATA AS WELL. AS

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:53.551
WE CAN WE CAN LOOK INTO IT I

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.719
FEEL LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT AREA

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.855
AND YOU KNOW TERMS OF THE BILL

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:58.956
STATUE BUT WE CAN LOOK INTO IT

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.624
AND TRY TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND.

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:02.726
YEAH IF UNDERLYING ADAM BEFORE

00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:04.595

LOWER BALANCES ARE THE ONES WHO

ARE PAYING THE MOST FEES. AND I

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:27.471
THINK YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. WE

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:29.006
HAVE ALLOWED IT FOR A SYSTEM TO

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.741
FLOURISH THAT PUTS THE BURDEN ON

FAMILIES AND WORK TO NEED THESE

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:42.586
FUN TO MAKE AND- I'M ENCOURAGED.

00:43:42.653 --> 00:43:43.687
BY WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:45.255
FEDERAL REGULATORS IN CRACKING

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:46.924
DOWN ON HOW SOME OF THE BANKS

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:48.525
CHARGE OVERDRAFT FEES AND WE

00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:50.627
HAVE SOME EARLY SIGNS. THAT THE

00:43:50.694 --> 00:43:53.230

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.565
A NUMBER OF ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM

THEY'RE RETHINKING THESE FEES

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.204
ALL TOGETHER. HOWEVER IN THE

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:01.972

SMALLER BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS

00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.643
ARE RELYING ON OVERDRAFT FEES TO

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.079
