MISSION WHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF ACR NINETY FOUR AS WE HONOR THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NANCY DAVIS REAGAN I COMMEND HER FOR LIFE DEDICATE TO THE SERVICE OF OUR GREAT NATION AND OUR STATE. THE REAGANS WERE AVID SUPPORTERS OF THE VIETNAMESE REFUGEES MIGRATION. HI MY FAMILY THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND VIETNAMESE AMERICANS AND MILLIONS OF VIETNAMESE REFUGEES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WOULD NOT BE HERE. I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE IN FRONT OF YOU. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE SUPPORT FROM NANCY REAGAN AND HER HUSBAND. I WILL ALWAYS CELEBRATE THIS ADMINISTRATION WHO SUPPORTED MY FAMILY. THE VENOMOUS REFUGEE AS WE CAME TO AMERICA ON A BOAT IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. CELEBRATING OUR FIRST LADIES LADY NANCY REAGAN'S BIRTHDAY SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE AT ALL. NO MATTER YOUR PARTY OR POLITICAL IDEOLOGY THIS IS A SAD DAY FOR AMERICA NANCY REAGAN WAS AN EXEMPLARY FIRST LADY. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ACR. NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU MR WHEN MR COOLEY YOUR REFERENCE. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION I THINK. IN OUR PUBLIC LIFE I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM FREMONT. THIS THOUGHT THIS IS A COUPLE. WHATEVER THE POLICIES OF THE HUSBAND. THEY WERE WED FOR FIFTY TWO YEARS. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THE LIFE TO UNFOLD FOR HER HUSBAND WAS NOT IN PROSPECT. SHE WAS A BRIGHT ABLE LADY ACCOMPLISH OUR OWN RIGHT. AND FOR FIVE DECADES. SUBORDINATED HERSELF FOR OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST TO THE CAREER OF HER HUSBAND THAT'S NOT ANY MAN CAN DO THAT WE NOW SEE THAT IN THE VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE A MAN WHO IS SO BORED AND SELF TO THE WHITE TO HIS WIFE'S CAREER. BUT THIS IS COMMENDABLE BY ANY MEASURE THE- DEVOTION AND THEN OF COURSE OTHERS ALWAYS HAVE PROSPECT WILL IT'S NOT FUN NOW BUT IT WILL LAND AND I'LL HAVE MY SPOUSE BACK AND OF COURSE ALZHEIMER'S INTERVENED TO SET THAT OFF THE RAILS FOR A DECADE. AND THEIR LIFE TOGETHER. SO ACROSS FIFTY YEARS ALL THE WAS INVOLVED BEING THE SPOUSE OF A PUBLIC FIGURE IN DURING ALZHEIMER'S WHICH IS OF COURSE HOW I LOST MY MOM. ANA THESE ARE TALES. OF EXHIBITING GREAT ENDURANCE AND CHARACTER. I THINK IT IS RIGHT IN FIT IN IN PUBLIC LIFE WE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS WAY IN THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR OF COURSE THE DEMOCRATS MEET IN THE MATTER LOUNGE. HONORING A PROMINENT- REPUBLICAN WITH WHOM THEY BATTLED REGULARLY- SO I THINK IT IS FITTING TO. IDENTIFY OUTSTANDING QUALITIES IN AN INDIVIDUAL THE DEBATE A DIFFERENCE IN POLITICAL LIFE AND WE ALL NEED THOSE IN OUR LIFE- GINGIVAL. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY THANK YOU MEMBERS THIS VALLADARES. MEMBERS I'M A BIT DISAPPOINTED I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT THE BASELESS FALSEHOODS WERE THAT WERE MENTIONED ON THIS FLOOR TODAY AND WHAT I CAN ONLY ASSUME WAS AN ATTEMPT TO GAIN SOME. CHEAP POLITICAL POINTS. YOU KNOW IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT STUDY HISTORY ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT. TODAY I THINK IT'S MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THOSE WHO CONDEMN HISTORY. LIKELY HAVEN'T STUDIED IT. NANCY REAGAN'S TRACK RATHER RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF SHE WAS A DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANT WHO SPENT HER TIME HELPING THOSE IN NEED AND MADE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THEIR LIVES. THAT IS EXACTLY WHY SHE GARNERED SO MUCH SUPPORT. FROM INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. FORMER FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA AND OBAMA ONCE REMARKED THAT NANCY REAGAN WAS A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR SO MANY ISSUES WHO REMINDED US OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP. AT EVERY LEVEL. AS A YOUNG GIRL WHO GREW UP WHEN THE NANCY WHEN NANCY REAGAN WAS OUR FIRST LADY I WAS INSPIRED BY HOW SHE GOT INVOLVED. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO GROW UP. IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. LIKE MINE YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW DRUGS PLAGUED OUR COMMUNITY. I WASN'T THERE PART OF THE DARE PROGRAM. AND WHILE THAT JUST SAY NO CAMPAIGN MAY NOT HAVE SAVED EVERYONE. I SAID NOW. SOME OF MY FRIENDS SAID NOW. SOME OF THEM DIDN'T. SO SHE SAID ABOUT ONE LIFE WITH THAT CAMPAIGN. IS NOT WORTHY. OF THIS RECOGNITION. AND WHEN AIDS HIT MY FAMILY. SHE WAS THERE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES. AND AWARENESS. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I'D BE IN THIS POSITION TODAY IF NOT FOR THE EXAMPLE. THAT SHE HELPS THAT. I THINK NANCY REAGAN IS MORE THAN DESERVING OF THIS RECOGNITION AND I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE IN HONOR OF HER LIFE. AND LEGACY. THANK YOU INSTRUCTORS WE WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS ARE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF L.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO BRING THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE YOU TODAY TO DECLARE THAT THIS COMING AUGUST SEVENTH. IS RECOGNIZED AS PURPLE HEART DAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE PURPLE HEART IS A METAL GIVEN NOT AN ACHIEVEMENT. BUT TO HONOR SACRIFICE. WHILE THE PURPLE HEART MEDAL ORIGINALLY CREATED BY OUR FIRST PRESIDENT GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS TO RECOGNIZE BRAVERY IN COMBAT TODAY IT IS USED TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO WERE INJURED IN SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY BY THE ACTIONS OF OUR ENEMY. THIS SIMPLE PURPLE RIBBON TRIMMED WITH WHITE HOLDING A BRONZE HEART WITH THE PORTRAIT OF PRESIDENT WASHINGTON. DENOTES THE HIGHEST RESPECT AND HONOR WE CAN WHAT ARE WE AS A COUNTRY CAN BESTOW. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION SERVICE MEMBERS HAVE BEEN AWARDED THIS MEDAL. MANY POST HUMOROUSLY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR SACRIFICES FOR WITHOUT THEIR SACRIFICES WE COULD NOT ENJOY THE VESTIGES OF FREEDOM WE HAVE TODAY.
