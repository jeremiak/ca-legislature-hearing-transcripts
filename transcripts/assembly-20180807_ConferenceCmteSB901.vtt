RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:13.940 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT TODAY HAVE FOUND OUR

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:15.308 region:rollup2
OUR CURRENT CAP A FIFTY THOUSAND

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.777 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER VIOLATION PER DAY.

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:18.879 region:rollup2
TO BE ABSOLUTELY INSUFFICIENT

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.547 region:rollup2
FOR THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.781 region:rollup2
SAFETY MATERIALS ADMINISTRATION

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:23.717 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL RAILWAY

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:25.418 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION SO I THINK THIS

00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:26.753 region:rollup2
IS OUR RECOGNITION AND ARE IN

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:29.889 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT TO TRY TO

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:31.758 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET US INTO MORE HONG

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.093 region:rollup2
LINE WITH WHAT THE FEDS REQUIRE.

00:06:31.758 --> 00:06:34.861 region:rollup2
IN TERMS TO RATE PAYER

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:36.329 region:rollup2
PROTECTION WILDFIRE POTENTIAL

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:38.665 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE REVIEWED FOR

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:41.001 region:rollup2
REASONABLE LISTEN THE RATE CASE.

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:42.869 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO BLANKET AUTHORITY

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.405 region:rollup2
OFFER OF WELFARE EXPENSE

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:47.574 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES IT REQUIRES

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.075 region:rollup2
EVOLUTION OF THE SAFETY CULTURE

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:51.811 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME OUT

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:53.980 region:rollup2
OF OUR EXAMINATION OF GAS AND

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:54.748 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC AFTER THE THE SAMPER

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.249 region:rollup2
NOTE.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:59.619 region:rollup2
EXPLOSIONS THERE'S NO TOP THE

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:01.154 region:rollup2
BOTTOM CULTURE AROUND SAFETY.

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.956 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT ORGANIZATION.

00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:05.425 region:rollup2
TOM WE SAW LOTS OF HIGHLIGHTS OF

00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:06.726 region:rollup2
REAL STRENGTH AROUND SAFETY

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.894 region:rollup2
WITHIN P. GINNY BUT IT WAS A

00:07:06.726 --> 00:07:09.796 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL THROUGHOUT THE

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:11.364 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT CULTURE WASN'T

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:13.400 region:rollup2
THERE THE YOU NEED TO SEE WHERE

00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:15.435 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY IN THE ORGANIZATION.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.937 region:rollup2
RESPONSE ON A DAILY BASIS TO

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:19.806 region:rollup2
EVERY DECISION THAT THEY MAKE

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:21.508 region:rollup2
WITH SOME CONSIDERATION OF THAT.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:22.809 region:rollup2
AND IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME SOME

00:07:21.508 --> 00:07:24.411 region:rollup2
OF THE REFORMS FOR THE LEGAL

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:26.146 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK FOR FOR WHILE FAR

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:27.847 region:rollup2
LIABILITY.

00:07:26.146 --> 00:07:29.549 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE CONTINUES TO ENSURE

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:31.217 region:rollup2
THAT OF THOSE WHO ACT

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:32.585 region:rollup2
NEGLIGENTLY OR HELD LIABLE.

00:07:31.217 --> 00:07:34.220 region:rollup2
IT'S MODELED AFTER THE

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:35.655 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SIDE

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.491 region:rollup2
JURISPRUDENCE FOR FLOOD CONTROL

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:39.759 region:rollup2
DISTRICT'S IT ALLOWS THE COURT

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:41.528 region:rollup2
TO WEIGH THE REASONABLENESS OF

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:43.363 region:rollup2
AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:45.665 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:47.567 region:rollup2
AND SO MY OBSERVATION IS THAT IS

00:07:45.665 --> 00:07:49.602 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH WHAT I SAID EARLIER

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:51.438 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR AND SYNONYMOUS THAT --

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.773 region:rollup2
HERE DIFFERENT LAWYERS GIVING

00:07:51.438 --> 00:07:55.809 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON HOW HOW

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:56.843 region:rollup2
MUCH WE CAN ACTUALLY DO IN TERMS

00:07:55.809 --> 00:07:58.211 region:rollup2
OF GIVING DIRECTION TO THE

00:07:56.843 --> 00:08:00.080 region:rollup2
COURTS UNDER THE INVERSE

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:02.148 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATION PROVISIONS OF THE

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.819 region:rollup2
SAY CONSTITUTION.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:07.420 region:rollup2
BUT MANY ATTORNEYS NOW TELL

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:08.221 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY EAST AND HAVE HAVE

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.456 region:rollup2
ADVICE THE THROUGH

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:11.458 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTIONAL FOR THE

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:12.959 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO ACT AND IF

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:13.526 region:rollup2
THERE'S GOING TO BE CHALLENGES

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.628 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE UP TO A COURT TO

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:18.098 region:rollup2
DECIDE -- SO

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:20.467 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF

00:08:18.098 --> 00:08:21.634 region:rollup2
THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.470 region:rollup2
GOING TO TAKE SECOND TO KIND OF

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:24.571 region:rollup2
RUN THROUGH THAT.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.438 region:rollup2
AS IT TURNED IT OVER TO LISA

00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:26.039 region:rollup2
CENTER TO QUICKLY TALK A LITTLE

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:28.108 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT OUR POLICY FRAMEWORK

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:29.476 region:rollup2
--

00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.810 region:rollup2
FOR HIGH UTILITY WILDFIRE

00:08:29.476 --> 00:08:32.545 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.082 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE CAN GET INTO YOUR

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:37.851 region:rollup2
VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:40.387 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE

00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:41.221 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OF AND HERE

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:42.822 region:rollup2
TODAY AGAIN.

00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:44.024 region:rollup2
POEM.

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.725 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THE

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:46.326 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION.

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.928 region:rollup2
IN FRONT OF YOU --

00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:50.330 region:rollup2
THAT OUTLINES THE POLICY

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:52.465 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK [inaudible]

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.900 region:rollup2
NO.

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:55.735 region:rollup2
OKAY OUT WELL I AM GOING TO GO

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.305 region:rollup2
THROUGH WITH MAKE SURE THAT YOU

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:59.939 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO IT OF LEADER NO.

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:03.810 region:rollup2
BUT THE EL THEN THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:06.613 region:rollup2
--

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:09.282 region:rollup2
SO ASPECT OF IT IS YOU NEED

00:09:06.613 --> 00:09:12.218 region:rollup2
THREE L. COMPONENTS FOR A WILD

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:15.388 region:rollup2
FIRE VOWED TO TAKE PLACE.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:16.656 region:rollup2
WELL YOU NEED FUEL --

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:17.824 region:rollup2
YOU NEED IGNITION AND THE L.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:19.893 region:rollup2
SOURCE [inaudible]

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:24.264 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER.

00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:26.366 region:rollup2
AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE THE

00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:27.700 region:rollup2
FROM POLICIES THAT WE COULD PUT

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:28.568 region:rollup2
IN PLACE IN DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.837 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S GOVERNMENT THE

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:35.675 region:rollup2
UTILITIES OR ANY OTHER AND CITY.

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:37.077 region:rollup2
AND THINK IT'S HOPEFUL TO GO. TO

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:39.946 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THOSE THOSE THREE

00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:41.114 region:rollup2
ASPECTS THAT BOTH DISCREET BUT

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:44.918 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO IN IRAQ WITH ONE

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:46.986 region:rollup2
ANOTHER HOME IN THEM.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:48.221 region:rollup2
IN ORDER.

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:51.091 region:rollup2
TO ON ONE HAND EL CREATE THE

00:09:48.221 --> 00:09:52.592 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS FOR WILD FIRES BUT ON

00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.594 region:rollup2
THE OTHER HAND AS WELL.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:57.130 region:rollup2
ON THE MITIGATION SIDE WE NEED

00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:59.065 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE THREE COMPONENTS TO

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.633 region:rollup2
BE --

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.134 region:rollup2
WORKING TOGETHER FOR US TO

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:04.637 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THOSE

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:07.040 region:rollup2
THREATS.

00:10:04.637 --> 00:10:08.508 region:rollup2
NELSON THE FUEL MANAGEMENT SIDE

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.543 region:rollup2
IN THE UTILITY CON SEX WITH

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:12.212 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY TALKING ABOUT

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:16.583 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:19.419 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:25.492 region:rollup2
GETTING FIDGET SEASTRAND ROUNDS.

00:10:19.419 --> 00:10:26.793 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT CLIENTS --

00:10:25.492 --> 00:10:27.794 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULD MANAGING THE MUD

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:30.063 region:rollup2
SITUATED THEY DON'T POSE A

00:10:27.794 --> 00:10:32.131 region:rollup2
THREAT SO REDUCING THE FUEL

00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:33.800 region:rollup2
AROUND THE ELECTRIC O.

00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:35.635 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ON THE IGNITION

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.103 region:rollup2
CONTROL THAT'S THE AREA WHERE

00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:40.607 region:rollup2
WE'RE FOCUSING.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:42.175 region:rollup2
ON EN EL THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:10:40.607 --> 00:10:43.009 region:rollup2
ITSELF IS THE CAUSE OF THE

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:46.246 region:rollup2
IGNITION.

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:47.981 region:rollup2
SO SPARKS RELATED TO ELECTRIC

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:49.582 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ALICE THAT THIS

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:51.885 region:rollup2
IS THE DOMAIN OF REALLY ASSET

00:10:49.582 --> 00:10:54.287 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT OF UTILITIES HARD YOU

00:10:51.885 --> 00:10:55.788 region:rollup2
MANAGE LINES EL IN SUCH A WAY

00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:57.090 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ARE IDENTIFYING FOLDS

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:58.691 region:rollup2
IN THE U. MINIMIZING THEIR

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.527 region:rollup2
FAILURE.

00:10:58.691 --> 00:11:01.160 region:rollup2
CALM AND EVEN JUST UP OPERATING

00:11:00.527 --> 00:11:03.730 region:rollup2
THE EQUIPMENT IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.099 region:rollup2
--

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.367 region:rollup2
DOZENS THOUGH BECAUSE IN THE

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:09.035 region:rollup2
MEASURE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.936 region:rollup2
REDUCES THE CHANCES OF THAT

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:10.703 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

00:11:09.936 --> 00:11:12.705 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE WEATHER

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:15.308 region:rollup2
PREPAREDNESS SIDE THIS IS WERE

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:17.377 region:rollup2
WE TALKING ABOUT SITUATIONAL

00:11:15.308 --> 00:11:19.913 region:rollup2
AWARENESS WELL WITH THIS THE

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:21.714 region:rollup2
STRANDS O. UNDERSTANDING HOW THE

00:11:19.913 --> 00:11:23.750 region:rollup2
CLIMATE IS BEHAVING AND GETTING

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:24.284 region:rollup2
BETTER AND BETTER AT RESPONDING

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.084 region:rollup2
TO THOSE CONDITIONS ON THE

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:27.287 region:rollup2
GROUND.

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:28.521 region:rollup2
SO AT THE AT THE VERY HIGH LEVEL

00:11:27.287 --> 00:11:29.722 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND OF THE

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.891 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK IS THIS THREE

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:34.027 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES AND LOOKING AT EACH

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:35.528 region:rollup2
OF THEM INDIVIDUALLY AND THEN

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.963 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE INTERPLAY

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:39.465 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TOWN THOSE THREE

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:39.899 region:rollup2
AREAS.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:40.967 region:rollup2
WELL.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.469 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE THERE ARE A FEW

00:11:40.967 --> 00:11:46.172 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES ALL TPC OF RECENT

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:48.741 region:rollup2
POLICY ACTIONS INEACH ONE OF

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:50.577 region:rollup2
THOSE DOMAINS --

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.579 region:rollup2
THE UCBCP YOU SEE HAS BEEN

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:55.381 region:rollup2
LOOKING UP WHILE FIRE SAFETY FOR

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:58.484 region:rollup2
A LONG TIME AND SLOW LONG

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:59.419 region:rollup2
HISTORY OF DECISIONS THAT --

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.621 region:rollup2
HOST BE IN OVERTIME

00:11:59.419 --> 00:12:02.155 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENING OF THE REGULATIONS

00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:04.924 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THE BIGGEST

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:09.229 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:10.363 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WAS ADOPTED BY LAST

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:12.832 region:rollup2
YEAR WELL IT WAS A SET OF

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:13.766 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THAT MATCH THE WILD

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:14.367 region:rollup2
FIRE --

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.636 region:rollup2
HAZARD PLANS AND ALL THAT WERE

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:18.571 region:rollup2
--

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:20.106 region:rollup2
ALSO ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.840 region:rollup2
BUT THE VIN SEVERAL OTHER

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:22.609 region:rollup2
DECISIONS IN THE FROM

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.611 region:rollup2
PROCEEDINGS AND STAFF ACTIONS AS

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:26.212 region:rollup2
WELL SOME EXAMPLES IN FUEL

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:27.880 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT SO THIS IS WHERE THE

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:29.249 region:rollup2
DECISION ADOPTED MORE STRINGENT

BEEN SEEN AS SOMETHING THAT

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.437 region:rollup2
DOESN'T NECESSARILY CAUSE A

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:25.271 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE THREAT BY IT BECAUSE

00:13:24.437 --> 00:13:27.607 region:rollup2
THEY ARE COOL A KEY TO THE

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:29.242 region:rollup2
USUALLY WITH ELECTRIC CLIENTS.

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:30.810 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY JUST AS IMPORTANT

00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:32.278 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS AT

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.179 region:rollup2
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:35.248 region:rollup2
ARE MAINTAINING THEIR

TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES IN

00:13:35.248 --> 00:13:38.551 region:rollup2
THE SAFE MATTER NOT OVERLOADING

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.886 region:rollup2
THE POLLS NOT APPROACHING THEM

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.621 region:rollup2
IT'S ALREADY SPACE --

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:42.455 region:rollup2
NOT CREATING CONDITIONS WHERE IT

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:44.057 region:rollup2
FEELING OF LEE COOK

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:45.625 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATION LINE CAN THEN

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:47.560 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF FEELING OF ELECTRIC

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:48.795 region:rollup2
LINE SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IT'S

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.999 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THOUGH.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:54.200 region:rollup2
IT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART FOR THE

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:56.002 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF IMPROVING OUR

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.770 region:rollup2

00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:04.477 region:rollup2
BUT WE HOPE THE WILDFIRE MOPS --

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:05.278 region:rollup2
AND THE G. EMERGENCY SOME POLICY

00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:07.714 region:rollup2
THAT -- ALL

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:09.315 region:rollup2
HOPES AT ALL THE PROCESS THROUGH

00:14:07.714 --> 00:14:11.451 region:rollup2
WHICH UTILITIES CAN BETTER

00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:12.385 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO CONDITIONS IN REAL

00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:14.287 region:rollup2

00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:17.790 region:rollup2
LAST SO.

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:20.893 region:rollup2
MEASURE OF LAST RESORT AT ALL

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.795 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.663 region:rollup2
HEALTH FOR SAFETY.

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:25.131 region:rollup2
WELL I'M SO THAT THE JUST SOME

00:14:23.663 --> 00:14:28.468 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES.

00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:30.670 region:rollup2
WE KNOW PROVIDED A LIST OF OWE.

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:32.305 region:rollup2
THE DECISIONS IN THE LAST FEW

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.673 region:rollup2
YEARS THOUGH TO THE TWENTY

00:14:32.305 --> 00:14:35.007 region:rollup2
DECISIONS AND THEY GET VERY

00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:36.109 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL SOMEONE GOING TO GO

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.643 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL OF THE ALL BUT THOSE

00:14:36.109 --> 00:14:40.313 region:rollup2
ARE EXAMPLES OF ACTIONS THAT THE

00:14:37.643 --> 00:14:41.414 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS STICKING EACH ONE

00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:41.714 region:rollup2
OF THOSE AREAS TO DATE

00:14:41.414 --> 00:14:43.549 region:rollup2

HOME.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.551 region:rollup2
SO NOW I'M GONNA TURN TALKING

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.453 region:rollup2
ABOUT MORE OF THE PRIORITY FOR

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.389 region:rollup2
FUTURE ACTIONS AND WHERE WE ARE

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:50.923 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S SO OUR ASSESSMENT OF

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:53.126 region:rollup2
WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE CALM

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:54.927 region:rollup2
CONCERNS OF PREVENTION MEASURES

00:14:53.126 --> 00:14:56.829 region:rollup2
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CATEGORIES.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:58.531 region:rollup2
WELL LISTEN THE FUEL MANAGEMENT

00:14:56.829 --> 00:15:01.134 region:rollup2
OF THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT O.

00:14:58.531 --> 00:15:03.169 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY THIS IS BE IN A

00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:05.037 region:rollup2
THAT LARGELY MANUAL PROCESS THE

00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:06.672 region:rollup2
WAY IT'S WORKS OF THE UTILITIES

00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:08.841 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:10.243 region:rollup2
AND GLOBALLY IT'S AND THIS ISN'T

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:12.812 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC.

00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:15.348 region:rollup2
WELL PROCESS O. UTILITIES DIVIDE

00:15:12.812 --> 00:15:17.617 region:rollup2
THEIR TERRITORY IN TWO SECTIONS

00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:19.585 region:rollup2
OF THE HALL OF OF SCHEDULES AT

00:15:17.617 --> 00:15:21.654 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOW EVERY ONE OF THOSE

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:23.756 region:rollup2
AREAS NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED THEY

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:25.057 region:rollup2
HIRE A CONTRACTOR. TO GIVE THEM

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:27.660 region:rollup2
THE MAP IN THE SCHEDULE AND SAY

00:15:25.057 --> 00:15:29.662 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO INSPECT THIS AREA ON

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.797 region:rollup2
THE SCHEDULE AND THEN.

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:34.133 region:rollup2
CALM.

00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:35.868 region:rollup2
AYE AND IDENTIFY ANY VEGETATION

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:37.203 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE MANAGED AND

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:39.038 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S THE SECOND SORT OF

00:15:37.203 --> 00:15:40.339 region:rollup2
LAYER OF WORK THAT SEEKS POLICE

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:41.707 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON THAT INITIAL

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:43.543 region:rollup2
INSPECTION A SECOND.

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:44.877 region:rollup2
THE ROOFS SORT OF WORK IS DONE

00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:47.013 region:rollup2
WHERE WELL.

00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:49.582 region:rollup2
CREWS GO OUT AND ACTUALLY CUT

00:15:47.013 --> 00:15:50.983 region:rollup2
THE VEGETATION AND MAINTAIN THAT

00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:51.584 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A VERY --

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.452 region:rollup2
AND LIEBERMAN SENSE OF PROCESS

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:57.290 region:rollup2
--

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:59.792 region:rollup2
ALONE IS INVOLVES A LOT OF ALL

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.626 region:rollup2
BUT JUDGMENT BUT INDIVIDUAL BY

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.694 region:rollup2
FOREST THERE ISN'T BY ARE BRUCE

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:03.796 region:rollup2
WHO PERFORM THAT INITIAL

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:06.432 region:rollup2
INSPECTION.

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:08.100 region:rollup2
AL I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS OUT IN

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:09.502 region:rollup2
PRACTICE BOY I THINK THAT IF YOU

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.470 region:rollup2
WOULD SEND SEND THE FROM OUR

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:11.437 region:rollup2
PERSONAL FORESTERS IN THE SAME

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.206 region:rollup2
ROUTE THE RULES COME BACK WITH

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.640 region:rollup2
VARYING RESULTS BECAUSE THAT'S

00:16:13.206 --> 00:16:16.476 region:rollup2
JUST HOW HUMANS WORK.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.044 region:rollup2
RATE WHEN YOU'RE EITHER YOU

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:19.612 region:rollup2
VISUALLY PICKING OUT THINGS LIKE

00:16:18.044 --> 00:16:21.781 region:rollup2
CRACKS IN THAT FREEZING YOU

00:16:19.612 --> 00:16:23.082 region:rollup2
USING YOUR JUDGMENT AND YOUR

00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:23.683 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE.

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:25.451 region:rollup2
SO.

00:16:23.683 --> 00:16:26.252 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT A

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:29.322 region:rollup2
HOME.

00:16:26.252 --> 00:16:30.957 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE SECONDARY PART OF

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:33.226 region:rollup2
FORM THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:35.495 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES THERE REALLY JUST

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:37.196 region:rollup2
THERE TO FLIP FOLLOWING YOU KNOW

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:38.798 region:rollup2
THE GUIDELINES OF HOW TO SAFELY

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:41.167 region:rollup2
OF THE KATA REMOVER TREE.

00:16:38.798 --> 00:16:42.635 region:rollup2
ALSO THE REALLY OWE MORE OF JUST

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:45.204 region:rollup2
EXPERTS ON HOW TO TRIM THE TREE

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:47.507 region:rollup2
IN AND NOT NOT REALLY THEREFORE

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:48.541 region:rollup2
IN ANY ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:52.011 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:54.380 region:rollup2
AND ELM THIS THE THIS IS EXPENSE

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:56.382 region:rollup2
OF WITH SPENDS AM.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:59.619 region:rollup2
A THING CLOSE TO PROBABLY HALF A

00:16:56.382 --> 00:17:01.120 region:rollup2
BILLION OF DOLLARS GO ALL OPRAH

00:16:59.619 --> 00:17:03.055 region:rollup2
RATIONS A MAINTENANCE ACROSS ALL

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.257 region:rollup2
OF THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:06.125 region:rollup2
ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OF

00:17:04.257 --> 00:17:08.094 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE OF RIGHT OF WAYS OF

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:08.995 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WALKING AROUND.

00:17:08.094 --> 00:17:11.631 region:rollup2
CALM DOING THIS THESE

00:17:08.995 --> 00:17:12.832 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS AND THEN TRIMMING --

00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:13.866 region:rollup2
THE TREES.

00:17:12.832 --> 00:17:16.669 region:rollup2
CALM AND THEY GET THEM FROM

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:17.436 region:rollup2
UTILITY POINT OF VIEW THEIR

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:19.205 region:rollup2
PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON COMPLIANCE

00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:22.408 region:rollup2
SO WHAT THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING.

00:17:19.205 --> 00:17:23.342 region:rollup2
FOR CALM IN THIS IS MEAN MAKING

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:25.444 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WHATEVER IS NOT

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:26.445 region:rollup2
REQUIRED CLEARANCE IS MAINTAINED

00:17:25.444 --> 00:17:28.948 region:rollup2
AND THEN TRIMMING BACK THE

00:17:26.445 --> 00:17:30.349 region:rollup2
VEGETATION THAT'S LIKELY TO GROW

00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:32.485 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT CLEARANCE SPACE.

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:33.819 region:rollup2
WOULD THEN THE NEXT CYCLE RATES

00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:35.288 region:rollup2
OF THEIR TRIMMING IT FURTHER

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:37.723 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT THE REQUIRED

00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:38.724 region:rollup2
CLEARANCES IN ANTICIPATION THAT

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:40.593 region:rollup2
THE NEXT TIME WE COME AROUND

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.594 region:rollup2
I'LL BE HERE LATER AND THEY NEED

00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:43.062 region:rollup2
THAT BALL.

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:44.730 region:rollup2
FOR A CALM AND THEN THE RULES OF

00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:46.198 region:rollup2
PICKING UP YOU KNOW OBVIOUS

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.533 region:rollup2
HAZARDS SUCH AS OF THAT TREE

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:49.201 region:rollup2
WELL THE PROBLEM WITH ALL OF

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:50.570 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT IN THE CLIMATE

00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:51.871 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT WE'RE FACING

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.440 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:56.809 region:rollup2
WHERE WE FREQUENTLY SEEING EL

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.110 region:rollup2
VERY HIGH WINDS --

00:17:56.809 --> 00:18:00.079 region:rollup2
YOU HAVING HEALTHY TREES FAIL

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.681 region:rollup2
CALM AND AND BRANCHES AND THEY

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:03.249 region:rollup2
FLY FROM OUTSIDE OF THE

CLEARANCE SPACE.

00:18:03.249 --> 00:18:07.219 region:rollup2
CALM AND SO.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:10.856 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:11.891 region:rollup2
THE FOR ONE OF THE THE MENTAL

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:14.026 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES WITH THIS PARADIGM

00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:15.227 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU ONLY FOCUSING ON

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.862 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE OR ALL OF YOUR

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:18.998 region:rollup2
CLEARANCES ABOVE YOUR RIGHT OF

BILL.

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:25.004 region:rollup2
IT'S THOUGH BY NO MEANS AT ALL

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:27.607 region:rollup2
BE SURE PROOF WAY TO CALM

00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:30.610 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENTLY MITIGATES THE O.

00:18:27.607 --> 00:18:32.111 region:rollup2
THE VEGETATION O. THE FUEL LOW

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:35.214 region:rollup2
RISK THAT WE'RE FACING.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:38.084 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE

00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:40.319 region:rollup2
CALM NOT ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:42.888 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED WIDELY BLADES WELL

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:44.290 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:46.192 region:rollup2
FOR A BIG THE THE MACHINE

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.294 region:rollup2
LEARNING ALL SOLUTION AND THE SO

00:18:46.192 --> 00:18:49.028 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:51.230 region:rollup2
HOPE WITH.

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:52.698 region:rollup2
A WHOLE NEW FLYING.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.967 region:rollup2
DRONES OR OF THE DOING OF THE

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:56.569 region:rollup2
AERIAL PATROLS AND COLLECTING A

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.704 region:rollup2
LOT OF VISUAL DETAILS FOR LIGHT

00:18:56.569 --> 00:19:01.240 region:rollup2
OR ANOTHER SERVING OF SOMETHING

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:02.742 region:rollup2
THATS DONE THE TRANSMISSION

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.676 region:rollup2
HOME ON THE ANNUAL BASIS.

00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.577 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE --

00:19:03.676 --> 00:19:05.878 region:rollup2
VERY VERY DIFFERENT QUANTITIES

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:07.947 region:rollup2
SO UTILITIES HAVEN'T BEEN DOING

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:10.149 region:rollup2
THAT SO MUCH DISTRIBUTION SIDE.

00:19:07.947 --> 00:19:11.984 region:rollup2
AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE COSTS AND

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:14.220 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE REASONS BUT

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:16.288 region:rollup2
EXPANDING THAT DATA COLLECTION

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.423 region:rollup2
AND THEN THAT CHALLENGE WITHOUT

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.858 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS JUST PROCESSING THE

00:19:17.423 --> 00:19:20.059 region:rollup2
WITH THE VOLUME OF DATA FAST

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:21.961 region:rollup2
ENOUGH.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:23.629 region:rollup2
THOUGH TO MAKE IT USEFUL EL BUT

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:24.930 region:rollup2
AGAIN THOSE AT A THING THIS

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:26.298 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IS ABOVE ALL OF THEM

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.600 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:30.036 region:rollup2
AT LOOKING AT ADVANCED

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.371 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES IN BOTH EMERGING.

00:19:30.036 --> 00:19:34.140 region:rollup2
COMBINING SATELLITE DATA --

00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:37.510 region:rollup2
THEM WITH --

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:40.046 region:rollup2
WHO'S SERVING RESULTS AT HOME

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:44.583 region:rollup2
AND OTHER WAYS AND USING HOME

00:19:40.046 --> 00:19:45.685 region:rollup2
ADVANCED COMPUTING TO DO MUCH

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.952 region:rollup2
MORE GO HOME.

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:48.087 region:rollup2
ADVANCED THOUGH RISK MANAGEMENT

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:50.423 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO WITH

00:19:48.087 --> 00:19:51.924 region:rollup2
HUMANS CALM AND THAT'S JUST A

00:19:50.423 --> 00:19:54.026 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF NUMBERS AND VOLUMES

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:54.527 region:rollup2
THE HEADS WE CAN PROCESS A LOT

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.761 region:rollup2
MORE IT WOULD BE TO WITH

00:19:54.527 --> 00:19:58.330 region:rollup2
MACHINES.

00:19:55.761 --> 00:19:59.765 region:rollup2
SO THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT RISK

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.700 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT YOU COULD START.

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:03.502 region:rollup2
TO TAKING PEOPLE OUT THERE DOING

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.904 region:rollup2
SECONDARY VERIFICATIONS THAT IS

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.905 region:rollup2
WHERE THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING TO

00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:07.173 region:rollup2
WORDS.

00:20:05.905 --> 00:20:09.675 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:11.610 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED GLOBALLY THE ONLY OTHER

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:12.978 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT'S BEEN SORT OF ON THE

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.281 region:rollup2
EDGES A IN AUSTRALIA.

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:16.649 region:rollup2
CALM.

00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:19.118 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK DESERT KIND OF THE

00:20:16.649 --> 00:20:19.885 region:rollup2
AREAS TO BE LOOKING AND SO AS

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:20.986 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NEXT

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:22.521 region:rollup2
FRONTIER OF HOW DO WE MANAGE

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:24.323 region:rollup2
THIS PROBLEM RATHER THAN JUST

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:28.227 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON MAKING THESE

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:29.695 region:rollup2
CLEARANCES WELL WHITER --

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:31.163 region:rollup2
IT IS THEN I WILL GO THROUGH AS

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:33.132 region:rollup2
MUCH DIESEL IN SOME OF THE OTHER

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:34.767 region:rollup2
ONES A A THINK YOU THERE'S BEEN

00:20:33.132 --> 00:20:36.268 region:rollup2
A FAIR AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION ON

00:20:34.767 --> 00:20:40.039 region:rollup2
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:42.675 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER PREPAREDNESS AND

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:44.210 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING L. WHETHER IT THE

00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:45.711 region:rollup2
MORE GRANULAR LEVEL AND SOME

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.745 region:rollup2
SUCCESSES THOUGH.

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:49.482 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM --

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:50.216 region:rollup2
SEEM TO YOU.

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:53.185 region:rollup2
WITH THE PLAYING WHAT THE

00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:54.553 region:rollup2
STATIONS AND MOST CRITICALLY

00:20:53.185 --> 00:20:56.989 region:rollup2
COLLECTING GRANULAR WIND

00:20:54.553 --> 00:20:58.190 region:rollup2
INFORMATION CALL BECAUSE THAT

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:59.125 region:rollup2
BOTH GIVES YOU ON THE GROUND

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.760 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:02.628 region:rollup2
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF WHAT'S

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.898 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN PROXIMITY TO THE

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:07.099 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC CLIENTS BUT IT ALSO

00:21:05.898 --> 00:21:09.368 region:rollup2
ALLOWS YOU TO DO MUCH BETTER

00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:11.470 region:rollup2
MODELING AND UNDERSTANDING RISKS

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:11.971 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ACTUAL

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.372 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CONDITIONS WERE

00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:15.708 region:rollup2
HOPPING.

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:16.308 region:rollup2
AND GET MORE GRANULAR BUT THAT'S

00:21:15.708 --> 00:21:18.410 region:rollup2
HOMES DOES A LOT OF

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:21.113 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS AREA AND

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.615 region:rollup2
THEN ON THE IGNITION CONTROL.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.116 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:25.217 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:27.219 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES HAVE BEEN

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:29.121 region:rollup2
DEPLOYING WACO ó FULL SUN

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:30.122 region:rollup2
SAYING BEING ABLE TO PINPOINT

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.490 region:rollup2
SINCE.

00:21:30.122 --> 00:21:33.559 region:rollup2
THAT DISCONNECT LINES WHEN

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.461 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO FOLDS WHICH COULD

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:36.729 region:rollup2
INDICATE VEGETATION CONTACTS AND

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:38.731 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:41.167 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE NEXUS IS OVER THE

00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:42.535 region:rollup2
NEXT ALSO IN THESE THREE AREAS

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:44.003 region:rollup2
IS -- USE OF

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.638 region:rollup2
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY IN GOING

00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:48.140 region:rollup2
BEYOND SOME OF THOSE MORE MANUAL

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:49.241 region:rollup2
WAYS OVER A DONE A FINE RISKS

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.510 region:rollup2
AND DOING VISUAL HUMAN

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:53.179 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS AND THINKING OF HOW

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.947 region:rollup2
WE CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS MORE AT

00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:56.882 region:rollup2
SCALE AND FASTER.

00:21:54.947 --> 00:21:57.383 region:rollup2
USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA

00:21:56.882 --> 00:22:00.719 region:rollup2
STREAMS AND ADVANCE THE

00:21:57.383 --> 00:22:02.454 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:04.623 region:rollup2
AND THAT TIES TO THE QUESTION

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:06.125 region:rollup2
ALL OF OH DOUBLE CHECKING AND

00:22:04.623 --> 00:22:07.993 region:rollup2
HELPING BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:09.762 region:rollup2
WHOSE VALIDATING THE THIS AND

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:11.831 region:rollup2
THE INSPECTIONS OF THE UTILITIES

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:14.600 region:rollup2
A PERFORMING.

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:17.736 region:rollup2
CALM YEAH LIKE UTILITIES SO.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.904 region:rollup2
HOW FLOW VETO WHO OVER THIRTY

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:20.573 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THE IN

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:22.308 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALL TOGETHER I MEAN

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:23.809 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GOING TO DUPLICATE THE

00:22:22.308 --> 00:22:25.077 region:rollup2
WORKING NAY GAINES CREATES SOME

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:26.278 region:rollup2
WAS SIZE WORKFORCE JUST UNITS

00:22:25.077 --> 00:22:27.613 region:rollup2
JUST NUMBER IS RIGHT?

00:22:26.278 --> 00:22:28.647 region:rollup2
AND JUST PUTTING PEOPLE OUT

00:22:27.613 --> 00:22:29.982 region:rollup2
THERE TO DOUBLE CHECK PEOPLE

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:32.017 region:rollup2
ISN'T PROBABLY THE MOST

00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:33.586 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT WAY ESPECIALLY FOR THE

00:22:32.017 --> 00:22:35.321 region:rollup2
STATE'S WHERE IT SUCCESS.

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:37.223 region:rollup2
JUST TIME TO GET BUDGETS THROUGH

00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:38.123 region:rollup2
AND HIRE PEOPLE AND TRAIN THEM

00:22:37.223 --> 00:22:42.328 region:rollup2
AND MANAGE THEM.

00:22:38.123 --> 00:22:43.562 region:rollup2
HOME SO WE SHOULD COULD

00:22:42.328 --> 00:22:45.264 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS OF IT THEM BOOTS ON

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:47.299 region:rollup2
THE GROUND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:49.301 region:rollup2
DOUBLED ó MORE THAN DOUBLED

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:49.835 region:rollup2
OUR ELECTRIC SAFETY PROGRAM AND

00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:51.937 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE LAST TO JUST TWO

00:22:49.835 --> 00:22:53.973 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:56.275 region:rollup2
HOME WHILE WE'VE HIRING IN

00:22:53.973 --> 00:22:58.177 region:rollup2
DOUBLING THAT SEEKS TIME WE FROM

00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:59.812 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT EXPERTS STAFF TO HIRE

00:22:58.177 --> 00:23:01.247 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE AND TRAIN THEM SO

00:22:59.812 --> 00:23:02.848 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COST TO THAT AS WELL.

00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:05.017 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN NEEDS TO BE MINDFUL AS

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.318 region:rollup2
WE DOING THESE THINGS ALSO BUT

00:23:05.017 --> 00:23:07.953 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:09.755 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY NOT ONLY FOR THAT

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:11.023 region:rollup2
INITIAL ASSESSMENTS BUT ALSO IN

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:12.625 region:rollup2
HOW WE OUGHT IT.

00:23:11.023 --> 00:23:16.762 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED AS MANY

00:23:12.625 --> 00:23:18.964 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO DOUBLE CHECK THE

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:20.366 region:rollup2
RESULTS OVER YOU YOU KNOW OWN

00:23:18.964 --> 00:23:24.303 region:rollup2
FLAVOR VIDEO CAMERA.

00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:27.640 region:rollup2
HOME OR A LIDAR HOME IN OF THE

00:23:24.303 --> 00:23:29.575 region:rollup2
DEED A I WAS JUST I ASK IS THAT

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.476 region:rollup2
THE P. YOU SEE DOUBLING UP OR IS

00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.577 region:rollup2
THAT --

00:23:30.476 --> 00:23:33.045 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE P. YOU SEE YES OF THE

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:34.580 region:rollup2
STAFF IN MY SECTION HAS MORE

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:36.582 region:rollup2
THAN DOUBLED IN THE ELECTRIC.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.751 region:rollup2
POLICIES TO BRANCH BACK WELL SIX

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:40.619 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THOSE ONLY ONE GROUP

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:42.421 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE THAT

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:45.157 region:rollup2
OVERSAW ALL OF ELECTRIC ALL

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:46.425 region:rollup2
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND GAS.

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:48.127 region:rollup2
SAFETY THIRTY PEOPLE IN THE

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:49.995 region:rollup2
ENTIRE STATE SO THAT'S WHERE WE

00:23:48.127 --> 00:23:52.731 region:rollup2
WERE -- HOME.

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:54.433 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO SO WE HAVE

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.901 region:rollup2
NOW MORE THAN THREE PEOPLE OF

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:58.037 region:rollup2
JUST DEDICATED TO THE GAS SAFETY

00:23:55.901 --> 00:24:00.306 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND MORE THAN THIRTY

00:23:58.037 --> 00:24:02.274 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN THE ELECTRIC AND THAT

00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:04.043 region:rollup2
THIRTY HOUSE DOUBLED FROM ABOUT

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.010 region:rollup2
A DOZEN AND THAT WE HAD JUST TWO

00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:06.378 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:10.516 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN GROWING QUITE A

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:12.952 region:rollup2
LOS CALM IN IN THE LAST FIVE

00:24:10.516 --> 00:24:13.652 region:rollup2
YEARS AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE

00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.754 region:rollup2
OUR STAFFING.

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:16.722 region:rollup2
AT HOME.

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:18.490 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THOSE

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:19.658 region:rollup2
SORT OF MATHEMATICIAN NUMBERS

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.793 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:22.328 region:rollup2
ALL STILL BE HAPPY TALK MORE

00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:24.596 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS IN IN QUESTIONS AND

00:24:22.328 --> 00:24:26.332 region:rollup2
ANSWERS BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:27.299 region:rollup2
A PIN THAN THOSE THAT THE YOU

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:29.468 region:rollup2
KNOW AND WE SHOULD.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:31.270 region:rollup2
I THINK NOT ONLY BE LOOKING AT

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:32.638 region:rollup2
AT PEOPLE AND STAFFING AND HOW

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.572 region:rollup2
MANY AUDITS WITH DOING THAT

00:24:32.638 --> 00:24:34.673 region:rollup2
HUMANS AND HAULING YOU LINES

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:36.842 region:rollup2
WERE PATROLLING PHYSICALLY.

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:38.377 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO THINKING HOW CAN WE DO

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:40.479 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT DOUBLE CHECKING AT

00:24:38.377 --> 00:24:43.549 region:rollup2
ALL WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

00:24:40.479 --> 00:24:45.384 region:rollup2
AND USE MACHINES IN THE BOUNCE

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:47.252 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND SCHOOLS THAT AND

00:24:45.384 --> 00:24:48.754 region:rollup2
NOW ALL BECOMING AVAILABLE. TO

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:50.489 region:rollup2
US THAT WEREN'T EVEN THE COUPLE

00:24:48.754 --> 00:24:52.191 region:rollup2
OF YEARS AGO THIS WAS PROBABLY

00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:53.225 region:rollup2
NOT TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE BUT

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.727 region:rollup2
WHEN NOW NOT COSTS WERE WE CAN

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:57.696 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THINK.

00:24:54.727 --> 00:24:58.764 region:rollup2
DO THIS AT THAT SCALE AND NOT

00:24:57.696 --> 00:24:59.064 region:rollup2
JUST THEN AND PILOTS

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:00.599 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:04.303 region:rollup2
CALM.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:05.871 region:rollup2
THEN ELMO LAST THE SO THE LAST

00:25:04.303 --> 00:25:08.273 region:rollup2
SLADE AND SO IT SORT OF SHIFTING

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:12.044 region:rollup2
GEARS A LITTLE BIT WHO CALLED

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:14.680 region:rollup2
THE THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS

00:25:12.044 --> 00:25:16.782 region:rollup2
THE KNOTS AND BOLTS OF HOW.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.517 region:rollup2
THESE HIGH LEVEL IDEAS SORT OF

00:25:16.782 --> 00:25:20.352 region:rollup2
MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN THE

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:22.354 region:rollup2
REGULATORY SPACE BECAUSE WE USE

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.921 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:25.290 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE FRIEND.

00:25:22.921 --> 00:25:28.794 region:rollup2
OF HISTORIC PROCESS SEES THROUGH

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:30.262 region:rollup2
WHICH WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THE

00:25:28.794 --> 00:25:33.432 region:rollup2
BALL FORWARD HELM.

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:35.534 region:rollup2
ON THESE ITEMS AND SO THE

00:25:33.432 --> 00:25:37.102 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY SPEAKING SRI DIFFER

00:25:35.534 --> 00:25:38.237 region:rollup2
IT'LL FLOAT WERE EXTREMES I

00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:39.872 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY A THREE DIFFERENT

00:25:38.237 --> 00:25:41.507 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES AROUND THOUGH SO ONE

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:43.375 region:rollup2
OF THEM IS THE WILDFIRE

00:25:41.507 --> 00:25:45.144 region:rollup2
PREVENTION ON PLANNING.

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:46.612 region:rollup2
ALMOST OF THIS IS THE DOMAIN

00:25:45.144 --> 00:25:48.614 region:rollup2
WHERE UTILITIES AT ALL.

00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:50.416 region:rollup2
SO THE VOCAL PLANS OF HOW THE

00:25:48.614 --> 00:25:51.884 region:rollup2
GOING TO MITIGATE O. WILDFIRE

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:53.519 region:rollup2
RISKS IN THIS PACIFIC

00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:54.620 region:rollup2
TERRITORIES THAT FILE THEM WITH

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:55.988 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION OF CURRENTLY

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.423 region:rollup2
TAKES PLACE AS PART OF THEIR

00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:59.525 region:rollup2
GENERAL ORDER ONE SIXTY SIX

00:25:57.423 --> 00:26:00.159 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IT'S BEEN GOING ON

00:25:59.525 --> 00:26:00.759 region:rollup2
FOR AWHILE.

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:01.960 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.895 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME NEW PLAN

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.130 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BUT THAT THE

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:07.299 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK IS MORAL US THE SAME.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.901 region:rollup2
CALM THE PURPOSE OF THESE PLANS

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:10.736 region:rollup2
ISRAELI INFORMING I DON'T MEAN

00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:12.271 region:rollup2
YOU STAKEHOLDERS AS TO WHAT THE

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:13.539 region:rollup2
UTILITIES ARE DOING AND

00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:15.340 region:rollup2
COLLECTING FEEDBACK A STING

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:16.108 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.910 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLAN.

00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:19.778 region:rollup2
WELL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO ANY

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.712 region:rollup2
SUITABLE FOR OF THE INDO PROOF

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:22.448 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:23.615 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT NEEDS TO HELP

00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.983 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY RESPONSE YOU YOU

00:26:23.615 --> 00:26:26.752 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:28.387 region:rollup2
RESPONSE PLAN A RISK OF

00:26:26.752 --> 00:26:29.922 region:rollup2
MITIGATION PLAN TO THIS GOOD

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:31.356 region:rollup2
THINGS TO HALT IT GETS PEOPLE

00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.758 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES ARE

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:33.158 region:rollup2
UP IN THE VAN SUBMIT GIVES A

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:34.860 region:rollup2
GOOD FRAMEWORK FOR

00:26:33.158 --> 00:26:38.030 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:41.600 region:rollup2
AND IT'S COOL AGAIN FOR A FOOD

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:43.235 region:rollup2
FOR EVERYONE TO WILL SIMPLY GOOD

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.070 region:rollup2
FAITH ASSESS ALL PERFORMANCE

00:26:43.235 --> 00:26:45.971 region:rollup2
AFTER THE FACT RATES SO THE WAY

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.005 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED WHETHER IT'S FIRE

00:26:45.971 --> 00:26:48.173 region:rollup2
OR ANY OTHER KIND OF SO THE

00:26:47.005 --> 00:26:49.475 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHAT YOU WANNA DO IS

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:51.243 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLAN.

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:52.478 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU YOU HOW THE VANCE

00:26:51.243 --> 00:26:53.979 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU GO AND YOU COMPARE

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:56.248 region:rollup2
HOW YOU PERFORMED AGAINST THE

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:57.349 region:rollup2
PLAN YOU DO LESSONS LEARNED THAN

00:26:56.248 --> 00:26:59.184 region:rollup2
THE NEW REVISED THE PLANNING YOU

00:26:57.349 --> 00:27:00.986 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE SO PLAN

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.954 region:rollup2
SERVE THAT IMPORTANT PORT

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:03.288 region:rollup2
PURPOSE.

00:27:01.954 --> 00:27:05.858 region:rollup2
THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RATE

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:08.160 region:rollup2
MAKING AT ALL IS THE AREA OF

00:27:05.858 --> 00:27:08.861 region:rollup2
WHERE WE FUNDS UTILITIES WELL

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.329 region:rollup2
BEFORE I GO.

00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:11.964 region:rollup2
AGAIN.

00:27:10.329 --> 00:27:13.699 region:rollup2
FIRE A FEW YEARS AGO FOR LET'S

00:27:11.964 --> 00:27:15.200 region:rollup2
SAY FIVE YEARS AGO AND ALL THE

00:27:13.699 --> 00:27:16.535 region:rollup2
COMMISSION HOW THE AT ALL VERY

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.002 region:rollup2
DISTINCT JUST THREE MAKING

00:27:16.535 --> 00:27:19.571 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS SO THE OTHER

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:21.373 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.875 region:rollup2
ON THE CYCLE COME UP WHEN THEY

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:24.610 region:rollup2
ASK FOR A FOR MONEY THROUGH

00:27:22.875 --> 00:27:26.445 region:rollup2
GENERAL REEKIE SUPPLICATIONS AND

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:29.014 region:rollup2
THEN ABOUT THE FROM PARTIES

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:29.882 region:rollup2
ARGUE YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IT'S

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:30.716 region:rollup2
TOO MUCH NOT ABOUT.

00:27:29.882 --> 00:27:32.084 region:rollup2
COMMISSION CONSIDERS THAT THE

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:33.785 region:rollup2
VOTES ABOUT AND IT WAS ALWAYS

00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:35.621 region:rollup2
DONE FROM VERY RATES POINTS OF

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:36.922 region:rollup2
VIEW ON THE COSTS THAN THE MAIN

00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:37.890 region:rollup2
PARTIES IN THERE WOULD RATE

00:27:36.922 --> 00:27:39.158 region:rollup2
PAYER IN PHOENIX.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.826 region:rollup2
WELL THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZED

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:42.561 region:rollup2
THE GALLUP POLL THAT THAT WAS IN

00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:44.930 region:rollup2
THE BIG ENOUGH A CONSIDERATION

00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:46.431 region:rollup2
OF SAFETY THROUGH THE PROCESS.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.233 region:rollup2
AND WENT THROUGH A VERY LENGTHY

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:49.701 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DESIGN A

00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:51.036 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY TO DO RATE CASES IN

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:53.205 region:rollup2
THE WAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:54.239 region:rollup2
THINGS CONSIDERED AT THAT TIME.

00:27:53.205 --> 00:27:57.276 region:rollup2
IN THE METHODOLOGY THAT ABOUT

00:27:54.239 --> 00:27:59.044 region:rollup2
THE CAN RATE PAYER INTERVENE

00:27:57.276 --> 00:28:00.646 region:rollup2
ISN'T SAFETY ADVOCATES IN MANY

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:03.015 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT GROUP CAME UP WITH WAS

00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:04.483 region:rollup2
THE SORT OF THREE STEP PROCESS

00:28:03.015 --> 00:28:05.517 region:rollup2
WHERE FOR THE FIRST PART IT IS

00:28:04.483 --> 00:28:07.452 region:rollup2
THE SOMETHING CALLED US MY

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:10.022 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHICH IS BASICALLY

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:11.790 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY FOR RISK ASSESSMENT.

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:14.793 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A DATA

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:16.495 region:rollup2
DRIVEN SO THAT IS THE VERY

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:17.863 region:rollup2
DETAILED WAY THAT UTILITIES GO

00:28:16.495 --> 00:28:18.664 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THEIR OPERATIONAL

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:19.998 region:rollup2
RISKS.

00:28:18.664 --> 00:28:21.533 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN HIS MODELS WERE

00:28:19.998 --> 00:28:23.702 region:rollup2
EVALUATED HOW HE EATS ALL THESE

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:25.938 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES THIS RISK QUANTIFY

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:26.838 region:rollup2
THOSE RISKS AND HOW THE BILL

00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:27.506 region:rollup2
THESE MODELS.

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:28.307 region:rollup2
SO THE COMMISSION WENT THROUGH A

00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:30.342 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF APPROVING THOSE

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:31.944 region:rollup2
MODELS WHICH IS HOW YOU DO RISK

00:28:30.342 --> 00:28:33.645 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS IN GENERAL AT

00:28:31.944 --> 00:28:34.713 region:rollup2
UTILITY AND THERE'S AN ONGOING

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:35.948 region:rollup2
WAY TO KEEP MAKING IMPROVEMENTS

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:38.183 region:rollup2
TO IT.

00:28:35.948 --> 00:28:40.719 region:rollup2
THE SECOND STOP IS RAMP WHICH IS

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:41.920 region:rollup2
A UTILITY SPECIFIC FILING WHERE

00:28:40.719 --> 00:28:43.589 region:rollup2
UTILITY.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.591 region:rollup2
BEFORE FILING THE REEKIE SAYS

00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:46.858 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THIS IS OUR ASSESSMENT

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:49.261 region:rollup2
OF OUR SPECIFIC RISKS IN THIS IS

00:28:46.858 --> 00:28:50.996 region:rollup2
HOW WE RANK THEM WILL UTILITIES

00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:52.764 region:rollup2
THROUGH BELIEVE A SINGLE ROUND

00:28:50.996 --> 00:28:54.1000 region:rollup2
THREAT RANK BELOW WILDFIRES IS

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:56.501 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE SEEK TO RISK AND THEN

00:28:54.1000 --> 00:28:57.703 region:rollup2
IT GOES DOWN FROM THERE.

00:28:56.501 --> 00:28:58.270 region:rollup2
CALM AND THEN THE INCOMES OF THE

00:28:57.703 --> 00:28:59.938 region:rollup2
GENERAL SO THATTHERE'S A

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.540 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO CONSIDER THAT IN FOR

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:03.075 region:rollup2
COMMISSION TO VOTE ON WHETHER

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.076 region:rollup2
THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND THEN THE

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:07.145 region:rollup2
RE KEANE'S COMES.

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:08.914 region:rollup2
WHERE THE REQUEST FOR MONEY?

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:10.148 region:rollup2
MATCHES SORT OF THE RISK

00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:11.750 region:rollup2
CATEGORIES IN THE COMMISSION

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:13.085 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS WHAT ABOUT SUFFICIENT

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.753 region:rollup2
ENDS AND THEN ONCE THAT GETS

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:16.321 region:rollup2
ADOPTED IN THE BACK AND THERE'S

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:18.724 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND AUDITING TO MAKE

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:19.825 region:rollup2
SURE THAT UTILITIES ARE SPENDING

00:29:18.724 --> 00:29:20.859 region:rollup2
MONEY WHERE.

00:29:19.825 --> 00:29:22.594 region:rollup2
THE SAID WEEKEND SUSPENDED ON

00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:24.029 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN THE TH BE DEVIATE FROM

00:29:22.594 --> 00:29:25.230 region:rollup2
THEIR REQUEST THEN THEY HAVE TO

00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:26.698 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.133 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE NEW MODEL THAT THE

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:29.668 region:rollup2
COMMISSION'S ADOPTED AROUND RISK

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:30.769 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT RATE MAKING.

00:29:29.668 --> 00:29:33.105 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE LAST SECTION OF THE

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:35.007 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT WHICH

00:29:33.105 --> 00:29:37.109 region:rollup2
IS DRIVEN BY COMMISSIONS GENERAL

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:37.676 region:rollup2
ORDERS --

00:29:37.109 --> 00:29:40.279 region:rollup2
GENERAL WOULD IN NINETY FIVE

00:29:37.676 --> 00:29:42.281 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HEAR I HAD --

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:42.581 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC UNTIL COMMUNICATION

00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:43.882 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:45.350 region:rollup2
OWE THEM.

00:29:43.882 --> 00:29:47.486 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE USE

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.087 region:rollup2
A STYLE FOR AUDITS AND INCIDENT

00:29:47.486 --> 00:29:50.956 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:52.691 region:rollup2
CALM THAT'S A STRICT CODE THAT

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:54.092 region:rollup2
SAYS THIS IS HOW YOUR CAN USE

00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:55.560 region:rollup2
NEED TO CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:56.428 region:rollup2
YOUR SYSTEM THAT'S WHERE THE

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.929 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:29:56.428 --> 00:30:00.165 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT LIVES.

00:29:57.929 --> 00:30:01.967 region:rollup2
AND TELL THEM IN ON THE BACK END

00:30:00.165 --> 00:30:03.268 region:rollup2
OF DIED BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:04.970 region:rollup2
FORCE MONTH ACTIONS THAT THAT

00:30:03.268 --> 00:30:06.538 region:rollup2
STAFF AND COMMISSION CAN SEEK IN

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.573 region:rollup2
THE RANGE FOR ALL.

00:30:06.538 --> 00:30:11.476 region:rollup2
ALL IN ALL INCOME FOR MONTHS AND

00:30:08.573 --> 00:30:12.944 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE UTILITY TO ALL

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:14.479 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ITS HOLES THROUGH

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:15.747 region:rollup2
PROGRESSIVE LEVELS OF

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:17.215 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT THAT CAN INCLUDE

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:18.817 region:rollup2
CITATION THAT'S A STAFF LOW

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:19.918 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PENALTY.

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:21.987 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND THE PORT

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:23.889 region:rollup2
INSTITUTING IN THE INVESTIGATION

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:26.091 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE LARGE ADJUDICATORY

00:30:23.889 --> 00:30:27.092 region:rollup2
PROCEEDINGS.

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:30.228 region:rollup2
SO THESE OF THE PAIN OF BEING

00:30:27.092 --> 00:30:30.796 region:rollup2
CALM SEPARATES THOUGH EFFORTS UP

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:35.834 region:rollup2
TO THE STATES.

00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:38.303 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE SO THINGS THAT I

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:40.439 region:rollup2
IN THE CURRENT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:42.307 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS DOING IS CLOSING THE

00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:43.842 region:rollup2
GAPS BETWEEN NAM.

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:45.510 region:rollup2
CALM SAID THE WAY THAT THIS THIS

00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:47.546 region:rollup2
IS OF ALL OF THE WHERE THINKING

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.680 region:rollup2
IN THE SEPARATE STREAMS MORAL AS

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:50.882 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD JUNE YOU KNOW

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:52.651 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS OF OUR GENERAL

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:53.485 region:rollup2
QUARTERS AND OUR COMPLIANCE.

00:30:52.651 --> 00:30:55.387 region:rollup2
EFFORTS WE'VE HAD IMPROVEMENTS

00:30:53.485 --> 00:30:57.122 region:rollup2
AND AND CONSIDERING SAFETY RISKS

00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:58.190 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE RATE MAKING AND THEN

00:30:57.122 --> 00:30:59.691 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD THE WILDFIRE

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.326 region:rollup2
PREVENTION PLANNING WITH THE

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:03.428 region:rollup2
WORD THE WASN'T A LOT OF WORK

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:05.230 region:rollup2
DONE TOOL --

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:07.499 region:rollup2
TO INTEGRATE THOSE THREE EFFORTS

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.600 region:rollup2
SIPPING THE CURRENT PROPOSAL IS

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:11.937 region:rollup2
AT ALL.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.573 region:rollup2
DOING TWO THINGS IT IS SO.

00:31:11.937 --> 00:31:15.674 region:rollup2
IT'S GOOD IT'S BUILDING UPON

00:31:14.573 --> 00:31:17.275 region:rollup2
WHAT THE WORKERS OR YOU CAN DIE

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:20.145 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS TOOK A LONG TIME TO

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:22.614 region:rollup2
DEVELOP AND NOT ALL OF FRUITS OF

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:25.817 region:rollup2
BOTH HOW COME TO BEAR YET.

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:27.119 region:rollup2
CALM BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES TIME

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:28.353 region:rollup2
FOR FOR THINGS TO GO THROUGH THE

00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:30.122 region:rollup2
REGULATORY SYSTEM IN THAT

00:31:28.353 --> 00:31:31.757 region:rollup2
SECTION HE IMPACT ON THE GROUND

00:31:30.122 --> 00:31:33.158 region:rollup2
AND SITTING YOUR CYCLE IT'S JUST

00:31:31.757 --> 00:31:34.025 region:rollup2
HOW IT WORKS IN ISRAELI LARGE

00:31:33.158 --> 00:31:35.327 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:37.028 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE JUST ABOUT POINT WHERE

00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:38.563 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE STARTING TO SEE A

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:39.865 region:rollup2
LOT OF BENEFITS FROM US SO

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:41.266 region:rollup2
CHANGING SO SOMETHING COMPLETELY

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:42.801 region:rollup2
NEW WOULD JUST SET US BACK.

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.569 region:rollup2
SO THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BUILDS

00:31:42.801 --> 00:31:46.938 region:rollup2
UPON THIS FRAMEWORK BUT IT ALSO

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:49.241 region:rollup2
CLOSES THE GAPS BETWEEN THEM BY

00:31:46.938 --> 00:31:50.809 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE HOME CREATING SOME

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.010 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LINKING

00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:53.111 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.012 region:rollup2
WITH THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:55.981 region:rollup2
RATE MAKING [inaudible]

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:56.515 region:rollup2
ELMER.

00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:58.350 region:rollup2
AND THAT I THINK WOULD BE

00:31:56.515 --> 00:32:00.185 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:02.254 region:rollup2
I KNOW IT TOOK UP QUITE A BIT OF

00:32:00.185 --> 00:32:06.558 region:rollup2
TIME DOES SO WITH THAT I WILL A

00:32:02.254 --> 00:32:09.127 region:rollup2
TURNIP OF AND THANK YOU OF

00:32:06.558 --> 00:32:10.662 region:rollup2
ALTERED TO TO MEMBERS AND SEE IF

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:11.997 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS BASED ON

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:14.533 region:rollup2
THE PRESENTATION.

00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:17.035 region:rollup2
UNDER JACK'S.

00:32:14.533 --> 00:32:19.971 region:rollup2
THANK YOU --

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:20.639 region:rollup2
SO I WASN'T A AT THE EARLIER

00:32:19.971 --> 00:32:23.275 region:rollup2
MEETING BECAUSE I HAD LONG

00:32:20.639 --> 00:32:24.743 region:rollup2
STANDING PLANTS TO TAKER.

00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:26.578 region:rollup2
AN EXPEDITION TYPE BOTH THROUGH

00:32:24.743 --> 00:32:28.113 region:rollup2
THE FJORDS AND THE GLACIERS IN

00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:29.815 region:rollup2
ALASKA.

00:32:28.113 --> 00:32:32.050 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT PREPARATION I WAS

00:32:29.815 --> 00:32:33.018 region:rollup2
TOLD NO ALASKA'S A RAIN FOREST

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.753 region:rollup2
IN IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:38.190 region:rollup2
FORTIES AND FIFTIES.

00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:39.724 region:rollup2
AND SO I A MAKE SURE YOU BRING

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.661 region:rollup2
MUD BOOTS SOMETHING I NEVER

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:44.896 region:rollup2
OWNED AND BE PREPARED FOR LOTS

00:32:42.661 --> 00:32:46.465 region:rollup2
OF RAIN IN FORTY DEGREE WEATHER.

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:47.532 region:rollup2
ENTIRE EIGHT DAYS TO THEIR IT

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:50.001 region:rollup2
WAS SUNNY AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:51.403 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:53.705 region:rollup2
NOW THE JOKE WAS I BROUGHT MY

00:32:51.403 --> 00:32:54.739 region:rollup2
SANTA BARBARA WHETHER WITH US.

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:56.942 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN ALASKA

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:58.877 region:rollup2
THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE.

00:32:56.942 --> 00:33:00.879 region:rollup2
AND SO THE FACT OF MY MENTIONING

00:32:58.877 --> 00:33:02.614 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT ALL THROUGHOUT

00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:03.548 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE WORLD WE ARE SEEING

00:33:02.614 --> 00:33:06.117 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:08.353 region:rollup2
CLIMATE.

00:33:06.117 --> 00:33:10.689 region:rollup2
AND IN DOING SO PEOPLE TALK

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:12.090 region:rollup2
ABOUT A NEW NORMAL --

00:33:10.689 --> 00:33:13.658 region:rollup2
BUT OTHERS TALK ABOUT THE FACT

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.127 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO NORMAL.

00:33:13.658 --> 00:33:18.663 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS TRUST UNCERTAINTY.

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:21.500 region:rollup2
AND I THINK --

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:22.601 region:rollup2
THAT YOU IT AS WE AS I LISTEN TO

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.901 region:rollup2
YOUR DISCUSSION TODAY

00:33:22.601 --> 00:33:25.337 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:27.706 region:rollup2
I AM.

00:33:25.337 --> 00:33:30.775 region:rollup2
DEEPLY CONCERNED --

00:33:27.706 --> 00:33:32.611 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FACT THAT --

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:38.250 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY KIND

00:33:32.611 --> 00:33:40.018 region:rollup2
OF COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING WHAT

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.087 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY ONE OF OUR PRIMARY

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:43.421 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS STATE

00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:45.156 region:rollup2
AS GOVERNMENT WHICH IS TO

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:47.092 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE SAFETY.

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:49.160 region:rollup2
AND SECURITY OF OUR PEOPLE.

00:33:47.092 --> 00:33:50.695 region:rollup2
AND AS WE ARE HERE RIGHT NOW

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.497 region:rollup2
FIRES ARE YET AGAIN BURNING

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:54.866 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:56.334 region:rollup2
AND TO IT'S ONLY SEVEN MONTHS

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:58.103 region:rollup2
SINCE THE WILDFIRE THE

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:59.170 region:rollup2
DEVASTATED MY COMMUNITY WHICH

00:33:58.103 --> 00:34:00.438 region:rollup2
BECAME.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.440 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST WILDFIRE IN

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:04.376 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HISTORY IT IS NOW

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.377 region:rollup2
BEEN SUPERSEDED JUST SEVEN

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:07.879 region:rollup2
MONTHS LATER.

00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:09.915 region:rollup2
BY THE MENDOCINO FIRES.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:11.349 region:rollup2
AND SO -- I

00:34:09.915 --> 00:34:13.518 region:rollup2
WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:15.253 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU BELIEVE

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:19.457 region:rollup2
TO BE THE P. UC'S ROLE.

00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:22.160 region:rollup2
IN ESTABLISHING A AND WHEN IT

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:25.030 region:rollup2
COMES TO A ADDRESSING THIS WHOLE

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.798 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF OF THE POTENTIAL FOR

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.533 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES IN THE REALITIES

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:31.336 region:rollup2
CREATED BY.

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:33.505 region:rollup2
OUR UTILITY COMPANIES AND EITHER

00:34:31.336 --> 00:34:35.941 region:rollup2
THE MISMANAGEMENT THE NEGLIGENCE

00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:37.676 region:rollup2
OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT WHEN

00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:39.778 region:rollup2
THESE POLLS FALL --

00:34:37.676 --> 00:34:42.581 region:rollup2
OR CREATE SPARKS TO CREATE THESE

00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:45.116 region:rollup2
FIRES THAT BURNED DOWN --

00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:47.319 region:rollup2
THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE'S HOMES

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:49.487 region:rollup2
TAKE LIVES DESTROYED BUSINESSES

00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:51.823 region:rollup2
DESTROYER CON TO ME WHAT DO YOU

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:54.025 region:rollup2
SEE AS THE P. UC'S ROLE.

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:57.028 region:rollup2
IN DEVELOPING THE SAFETY PLANS

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:59.097 region:rollup2
AND HOW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY AT

00:34:57.028 --> 00:35:02.200 region:rollup2
THIS POINT TIME YOU ARE --

00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:03.301 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING WHAT HAS

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.503 region:rollup2
BECOME.

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:07.105 region:rollup2
THE NEW NORMAL OR THE UNCERTAIN

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:08.373 region:rollup2
NORMAL WHERE WE ARE SEEING THESE

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:08.907 region:rollup2
MASSIVE FIRES.

00:35:08.373 --> 00:35:11.843 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST FIVE AND TEN

00:35:08.907 --> 00:35:13.712 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:15.680 region:rollup2
SO THANK YOU FOR A MINUTE JUST

00:35:13.712 --> 00:35:17.148 region:rollup2
KEY OFFER WHAT YOU SAID AND THAT

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.117 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS UNCERTAINTY.

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:21.186 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:23.021 region:rollup2
THAT IS CLEARLY UNCERTAIN AS WE

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:25.657 region:rollup2
STARTED THIS YEAR ALL OF FOCUS

00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:26.891 region:rollup2
WAS ON UTILITY INDUCED FIRES AND

00:35:25.657 --> 00:35:29.260 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE IN TEN FIRE COME FROM

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:30.795 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.897 region:rollup2
AS A MATTER OF FACT IS A FIRE

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.398 region:rollup2
THAT SU PROSTITUTE MISFIRE

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:34.733 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WAS CAUSED BY A

00:35:33.398 --> 00:35:37.235 region:rollup2
MOTORCYCLE.

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:39.404 region:rollup2
XIKAR FIRE WAS CAUSED BY A

00:35:37.235 --> 00:35:40.872 region:rollup2
PASSING CAR WITH A DEFECT.

00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:41.640 region:rollup2
YEAH SO I HATE IT I JUST WANT TO

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:43.375 region:rollup2
BE CLEAR.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.844 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:47.712 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO AROUND THE ELECTRIC

00:35:45.844 --> 00:35:49.047 region:rollup2
UTILITIES OR ANY OF THE COULD

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:50.782 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE COVER

00:35:49.047 --> 00:35:51.716 region:rollup2
CAN ADDRESS ALL OF THE

00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:53.918 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:55.887 region:rollup2
THAT IS SO OUR TASK IS TO REALLY

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:58.023 region:rollup2
FOCUS UNTIL UNTIL YOU TELL US

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:59.624 region:rollup2
THE YOU WANT US TO BECOME THE

00:35:58.023 --> 00:36:00.925 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FAR OF FORCE FIRE

00:35:59.624 --> 00:36:04.129 region:rollup2
ATTENTION.

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:05.964 region:rollup2
WE WE WILL FOCUS ON THE THE THE

00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:08.233 region:rollup2
THE MANY MANY DIFFERENT --

00:36:05.964 --> 00:36:10.001 region:rollup2
TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:12.237 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:14.639 region:rollup2
SO PART OF IT HAS BEEN.

00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:16.675 region:rollup2
REBUILD THE STRENGTH OF A SAFETY

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:18.043 region:rollup2
FUNCTION AT THE P. YOU SAY.

00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:21.413 region:rollup2
AS ALWAYS A BETTER SAID WE WERE

00:36:18.043 --> 00:36:22.747 region:rollup2
FAIRLY WEAK WHEN I GOT THERE --

00:36:21.413 --> 00:36:24.482 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DIDN'T TALK TO ME ABOUT

00:36:22.747 --> 00:36:26.818 region:rollup2
SAFETY I THINK WE'VE COME A LONG

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:28.553 region:rollup2
WAY BUT WE HAVE A LOT FURTHER

00:36:26.818 --> 00:36:30.655 region:rollup2
TRY JUSTICE AGO. ONE OF THE

00:36:28.553 --> 00:36:32.524 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT YOU DO YOU ACTUALLY

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:34.559 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON IS HOW DO YOU MAKE

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:35.960 region:rollup2
SURE THE YOU'RE STAYING WITH UP

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:39.330 region:rollup2
WITHOUT CHANGES.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.932 region:rollup2
NOW AS A REGULATORY AGENCY ARE

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.766 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GOING TO BE BEHIND THE

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:43.134 region:rollup2
BALL.

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:45.170 region:rollup2
POSSESS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.737 region:rollup2
WE MOVED TO THIS RISK ASSESSMENT

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.105 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PHASE IN THE RATE

00:36:45.737 --> 00:36:49.207 region:rollup2
MAKE.

00:36:47.105 --> 00:36:51.676 region:rollup2
IT MOVES INTO NOT JUST A

00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:53.745 region:rollup2
REGULATORY BUT A RISK ASSESSMENT

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:56.114 region:rollup2
TOOL SO THAT WE DON'T GET

00:36:53.745 --> 00:36:58.316 region:rollup2
SHARPER CUT SHORT OF HAVING TO

00:36:56.114 --> 00:37:00.785 region:rollup2
DO THREE YEARS OF LITIGATED

00:36:58.316 --> 00:37:03.555 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OVER A RULE.

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:05.757 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY SPECIFIES ACTIONS

00:37:03.555 --> 00:37:07.125 region:rollup2
THAT THEN CHANGES NEW

00:37:05.757 --> 00:37:09.194 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES COME INTO THE

00:37:07.125 --> 00:37:10.895 region:rollup2
MARKETPLACE OR CONDITIONS CHANGE

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:12.630 region:rollup2
IT'S DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY GET AN

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:13.932 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF WHAT ARE THE RISKS

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.501 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OUT THERE.

00:37:13.932 --> 00:37:18.536 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY ON

00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:19.804 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY BRING THEM DOWN.

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:22.740 region:rollup2
SO THAT I THINK IS A VERY

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:25.443 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT STEP IT DOESN'T.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.778 region:rollup2
I SHOULD THE CEILING.

00:37:25.443 --> 00:37:28.880 region:rollup2
IT ACTUALLY SAYS THE FLOOR WILL

00:37:26.778 --> 00:37:30.682 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY RISE.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.983 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS FAIRLY NEW WINNERS

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:34.018 region:rollup2
WERE IN THE END OF OUR FIRST

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:36.488 region:rollup2
CYCLE STARTING OUR SECOND CYCLE

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:37.889 region:rollup2
OF THESE PLANTS WERE LEARNING.

00:37:36.488 --> 00:37:39.390 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING THINGS AND I WILL

00:37:37.889 --> 00:37:41.192 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THAT EVERYBODY IS A

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.727 region:rollup2
WIN IN START TO DO THAT RATHER

00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:44.129 region:rollup2
THAN COMPLYING WITH A HARD AND

00:37:42.727 --> 00:37:45.363 region:rollup2
FAST RULES.

00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:46.598 region:rollup2
LET'S GO OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT

00:37:45.363 --> 00:37:48.299 region:rollup2
THE WORLD AND SEE WHAT WE THINK

00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.900 region:rollup2
THE NEXT CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:51.336 region:rollup2
BE.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.737 region:rollup2
AND STARTED ADDRESS THOSE RISKS.

00:37:51.336 --> 00:37:55.473 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED TO SEE

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:57.008 region:rollup2
WILD FIRES COME UP IN ALL OF THE

00:37:55.473 --> 00:37:57.542 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC UTILITIES PLANTS SO I

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:59.711 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE WE WILL GET

00:37:57.542 --> 00:38:01.012 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:02.547 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE WE HAVE TO

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:04.048 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY GET BETTER ANTICIPATE

00:38:02.547 --> 00:38:06.117 region:rollup2
NEW THINGS.

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:07.552 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE SPENT FOUR YEARS

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.787 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE SCIENTISTS SIC

00:38:07.552 --> 00:38:12.023 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE AND THE FIRE ENGINEERS

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:13.725 region:rollup2
TO MAP THE FUEL SOURCES HERE IN

00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:14.893 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:38:13.725 --> 00:38:17.095 region:rollup2
AND TO LOOK AT WHERE THE

00:38:14.893 --> 00:38:20.698 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE AND WE

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:22.267 region:rollup2
SAW THE AMOUNT OF OF AREAS WERE

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:24.702 region:rollup2
MAPPED INTO THOSE HIGH FIRE

00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:27.005 region:rollup2
HAZARD AREAS RISE FROM AROUND

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:28.439 region:rollup2
17% ALMOST 40% OF THE STATE'S

00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:30.308 region:rollup2
LAND MASS.

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:32.010 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT COMES FROM

00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:34.612 region:rollup2
ADVANCING DROUGHT.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:37.348 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT COMES FROM YEARS OF

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:38.917 region:rollup2
OF OF OF FORCED IN WILDLAND FIRE

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
MEYER COMMIT MANAGEMENT SOME OF

00:38:38.917 --> 00:38:41.920 region:rollup2
THAT COMES FROM THE PACE AT

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:44.322 region:rollup2
WHICH PEOPLE ARE.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.057 region:rollup2
BUILDING NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:48.293 region:rollup2
THOSE HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES SO

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:50.862 region:rollup2
WE WILL ALWAYS.

00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:52.730 region:rollup2
P. TYING TO KEEP PEACE WITH THE

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:54.499 region:rollup2
WAY IN WHICH THE STATE CHANGES

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:56.167 region:rollup2
SO IT GOES BACK TO THAT LEVEL OF

00:38:54.499 --> 00:38:58.036 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY THAT YOU ADDRESS.

00:38:56.167 --> 00:39:00.939 region:rollup2
WILL GET BETTER.

00:38:58.036 --> 00:39:02.841 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT ALWAYS ALWAYS BE SEEING

00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:03.675 region:rollup2
NEW THINGS COMING AT US SOME OF

00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:05.810 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE VERY HARD TO

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.110 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATE NOBODY EXPECTED

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.845 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:10.114 region:rollup2
EVER.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:13.751 region:rollup2
SEE THE KINDS OF INTENSE.

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:16.921 region:rollup2
WINS AND LOW HUMIDITY LOW SOIL

00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:19.257 region:rollup2
MOISTURE HOT TEMPERATURES.

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:21.459 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD RESULT IN INTENSE

00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:24.195 region:rollup2
FIRES WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:25.663 region:rollup2
FIVE MILE WINDS THAT.

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:27.432 region:rollup2
IS ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED SO

00:39:25.663 --> 00:39:29.100 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU SAY THAT SAFETY IS NOW

00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:30.301 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AT THE

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.870 region:rollup2
P. UC.

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:33.538 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN LEGALLY

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.340 region:rollup2
SAY THAT WE HAVE ANY NUMBER ONE

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:37.141 region:rollup2
PRIORITY YOU'VE TASKS WITH MANY

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.710 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:40.011 region:rollup2
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON AND

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.412 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT OTHER PEOPLE SPEND A

00:39:40.011 --> 00:39:44.215 region:rollup2
LOT OF TIME ON IT I THINK THAT

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:45.917 region:rollup2
WE ARE ACTUALLY APPROACHING.

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:47.619 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCE THAT

00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:49.220 region:rollup2
WASN'T THERE WHEN I STARTED HAVE

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:50.722 region:rollup2
YOU WORKED WITH GROUPS LIKE

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.591 region:rollup2
HELLFIRE IN THE MARSHALL OF THE

00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:56.794 region:rollup2
FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE WHICH A

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:59.297 region:rollup2
ARE TASKED WITH THIS VERY --

00:39:56.794 --> 00:40:01.633 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC NEW KNOWLEDGE AND AND

00:39:59.297 --> 00:40:03.268 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE SO FOR EXAMPLE WEEK

00:40:01.633 --> 00:40:05.336 region:rollup2
COMPLETED A MEMORANDUM OF

00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:07.238 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL FIRE TO

00:40:05.336 --> 00:40:09.240 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SHARE INFORMATION OVER

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:10.475 region:rollup2
THE COURSE OF FOUR YEARS WE

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:12.377 region:rollup2
WORKED WITH WORKING GROUPS WHO

00:40:10.475 --> 00:40:13.845 region:rollup2
WERE CONVENE BY CAL FIRES FIRE

00:40:12.377 --> 00:40:15.446 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS WE DON'T HAVE.

00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:16.714 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND FIRE

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:18.883 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AND FUEL.

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.984 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO IN IT'S

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:22.186 region:rollup2
IT'S UNLIKELY THERE WOULD BE A

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:24.022 region:rollup2
GOOD USE OF OF THE STATE'S AND

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:25.790 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS DOLLARS FOR US TO

00:40:24.022 --> 00:40:26.791 region:rollup2
REPLICATE THE SKILL SETS.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.392 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN FORMING

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:29.294 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER STATE

00:40:27.392 --> 00:40:31.629 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

00:40:29.294 --> 00:40:32.997 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:35.833 region:rollup2
BECAME AWARE.

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:37.135 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T DO WELLS.

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:38.937 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE WELLS THAT ARE

00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:39.938 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN GAS STORAGE

00:40:38.937 --> 00:40:41.973 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WHERE WE HAVE

00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:43.374 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY PASSED DOWN TO US FROM

00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:45.510 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR

00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:47.111 region:rollup2
PIPELINE MANAGEMENT WE FORMED A

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.212 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP IN MEMORIALIZED IT

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.514 region:rollup2
WITH A MEMORANDUM OF

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:50.782 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WITH CAL FIRE.

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:52.850 region:rollup2
SO I KNOW THIS IS A WAY THAT WE

00:40:50.782 --> 00:40:54.085 region:rollup2
TRIED TO DO THAT SO I GUESS TO

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.253 region:rollup2
CUT THROUGH THIS WOULDN'T IT

00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:57.388 region:rollup2
MAKE SENSE.

00:40:55.253 --> 00:40:59.123 region:rollup2
IF THE EXPERTISE ON HOW TO DEAL

00:40:57.388 --> 00:41:00.625 region:rollup2
WITH THESE FIRES HOW TO PREVENT

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:02.860 region:rollup2
THEM HOW TO WORK WITH THE

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:03.995 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT UTILITIES AND REQUIRE

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.398 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DEVELOP BEST

00:41:03.995 --> 00:41:09.033 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ON HOW THE

00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.968 region:rollup2
HOW THEY DRESS THE VEGETATION

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.269 region:rollup2
ISSUES -- WE

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:15.540 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT --

00:41:11.269 --> 00:41:17.542 region:rollup2
ASEAN CREATED AT THEIR OWN

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.811 region:rollup2
DIRECTION THESE WHETHER CENTERS

00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:21.779 region:rollup2
WHICH ADDRESS PART OF THAT

00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:22.413 region:rollup2
TRIUMVIRATE YOU INDICATED OF

00:41:21.779 --> 00:41:25.116 region:rollup2
WEATHER.

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:28.086 region:rollup2
AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE THIRD

00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:29.454 region:rollup2
ONE WAS SO --

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:30.755 region:rollup2
WILL YOU TELL ME THAT THAT THERE

00:41:29.454 --> 00:41:32.323 region:rollup2
WERE THE THREE THINGS THAT YOU

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:34.125 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IS BEING.

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:35.793 region:rollup2
THE FUEL THANK YOU THAT THEY

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:37.261 region:rollup2
HAVE DONE THAT --

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:38.763 region:rollup2
OR A BECAUSE YOU KEEP SAYING

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:40.665 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BEHIND

00:41:38.763 --> 00:41:42.100 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT IT THAT'S NOT

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:43.901 region:rollup2
GOING TO STALK THESE FIRES

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.470 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:47.238 region:rollup2
REDUCE LIABILITY.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.340 region:rollup2
IS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:51.242 region:rollup2
THE SARS WITHSO IT WOULD USE

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.010 region:rollup2
AND DO WOULD YOU AGREE THAT

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:54.946 region:rollup2
OPERATING OFF FROM THE

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:56.080 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND EXPERTISE OF

00:41:54.946 --> 00:41:58.082 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.518 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE YOU THE ABILITY TO

00:41:58.082 --> 00:42:02.353 region:rollup2
BETTER IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:04.422 region:rollup2
THESE UTILITIES OR MAYBE DIRECT

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:06.424 region:rollup2
THAT THESE UTILITIES APPLY THESE

00:42:04.422 --> 00:42:08.292 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES IN A PROACTIVE

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:10.328 region:rollup2
WAY SO THAT WE DON'T KEEP SEEING

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:10.828 region:rollup2
SO MANY FIRES HAY GROUP YOU A

00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:12.897 region:rollup2
100%.

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:15.299 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE THE

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:17.402 region:rollup2
PROGRESS OF THE THE WIND --

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:19.270 region:rollup2
MODELING HANDS ANEMOMETER SINCE

00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:20.905 region:rollup2
INDIA GO SINCE BEFORE I CAME TO

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:22.273 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.674 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY CAME TO US AND

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:25.643 region:rollup2
SAID WE WANT TO TRY THIS WILL

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:27.612 region:rollup2
YOU ALLOW US TO RECOVER THE COST

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:29.347 region:rollup2
OF ACTUALLY DEPLOYING THESE NEW

00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:30.848 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTAL.

00:42:29.347 --> 00:42:33.084 region:rollup2
MODELS THAT WE WANT TO DEPLOY.

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:34.318 region:rollup2
BOTH DIGITIZING THE LANDSCAPE

00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:36.554 region:rollup2
DOING THE NGUYEN MODELING

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:38.356 region:rollup2
STARTING TO BUILD THE ALGORITHMS

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:41.159 region:rollup2
FOR RESPONDING. TO YOU LET US DO

00:42:38.356 --> 00:42:43.061 region:rollup2
THAT AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.661 region:rollup2
WATCHED AND LEARNED.

00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:45.263 region:rollup2
IT THE ARROW IS HE DIDN'T LET

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:46.130 region:rollup2
YOU DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T ALLOW THEM

00:42:45.263 --> 00:42:48.166 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT.

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.934 region:rollup2
IS PART OF THE RATE YES WE DID

00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:52.503 region:rollup2
YOU DID OKAY GET WELL HOW MUCH

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:53.104 region:rollup2
COURAGE IN THAT FROM SOME OF THE

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.404 region:rollup2
OTHER UTILITIES THAT ARE US AL

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:56.340 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:57.375 region:rollup2
JUST STARTED THAT PROCESS OF

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:00.344 region:rollup2
REQUIRING THEM TO ACTUALLY LEARN

00:42:57.375 --> 00:43:02.146 region:rollup2
FROM THAT BUT I WILL TELL YOU.

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:03.614 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO WATCH

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:05.716 region:rollup2
INTO WORM WITH THOSE FOLKS ARE

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:07.385 region:rollup2
DOING WHO ARE TRYING TO LEARN

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:09.153 region:rollup2
NEW BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE AT

00:43:07.385 --> 00:43:10.421 region:rollup2
THE TIME NOBODY KNEW WHAT WOULD

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:12.423 region:rollup2
COME OUT OF IT.

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:15.460 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN GO TO

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:17.495 region:rollup2
FRIDAY SPENT BY OFF THE SHELF.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.230 region:rollup2
AND IT TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO

00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:20.798 region:rollup2
REALLY PERFECT AND I WILL TELL

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:23.201 region:rollup2
YOU THAT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:24.702 region:rollup2
EDISON WILL SPEND A LONG TIME

00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:26.270 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:27.905 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.607 region:rollup2
HOW WOOD DIFFERS IN THE

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:31.175 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE TO TAKE COVER SAN

00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:32.643 region:rollup2
DIEGO HAS A RING OF AMOUNTS

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:34.946 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE CITY?

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:36.614 region:rollup2
S. E. HAS THE COASTAL RANGE THAT

00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:37.248 region:rollup2
TO HATCH A PIECE IN THE SIERRAS

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:39.283 region:rollup2
ALL THE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

00:43:37.248 --> 00:43:40.685 region:rollup2
HAVE DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF HOW

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:42.787 region:rollup2
THE WIND PATTERNS BEHAVE.

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:45.189 region:rollup2
IN IN TERMS OF FUELS SO I'M I'M

00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:46.924 region:rollup2
TELLING YOU THAT WE WILL BE COME

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:48.926 region:rollup2
A LEARNING ORGANIZATION.

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:51.162 region:rollup2
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TRY

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:52.230 region:rollup2
THINGS BEFORE YOU KNOW THAT THEY

00:43:51.162 --> 00:43:53.731 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.634 region:rollup2
BY BUT WE DO KNOW THERE WHAT SD

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:57.935 region:rollup2
GENIE HAS DONE HAS APPEARS TO BE

00:43:56.634 --> 00:43:59.403 region:rollup2
WORKING IN A CERTAINLY

00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:00.805 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED A LEVEL OF BEST

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:02.707 region:rollup2
PRACTICE I'M WONDERING.

00:44:00.805 --> 00:44:04.809 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO LOOK TO SEE AGAIN

00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:05.943 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS PREVENTION THIS

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:07.578 region:rollup2
JULIE SAVATE UPON.

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:08.913 region:rollup2
ISRAEL PENSION WEAKENED ACTION

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:10.615 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE THOSE OTHER UTILITIES

00:44:08.913 --> 00:44:12.283 region:rollup2
TO DO IT PREVENTION AND SAFETY

00:44:10.615 --> 00:44:14.085 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK IS WHAT SHOULD BE

00:44:12.283 --> 00:44:15.786 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS OF OUR DISCUSSIONS

00:44:14.085 --> 00:44:17.388 region:rollup2
HERE PREVENTION AND SAFETY.

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:18.756 region:rollup2
I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:20.391 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT HAPPEN WHO'S GOING TO

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:21.959 region:rollup2
WIN FOR STATE HOW WE GOING TO BE

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:25.930 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE UTILITIES.

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:27.498 region:rollup2
ARE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISH SAYS

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:29.066 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE CAN ASSURE THAT THEIR

00:44:27.498 --> 00:44:30.568 region:rollup2
MEETING THOSE BEST PRACTICES IS

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:32.770 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR CHOPPER SHOULD BE

00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:35.873 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOB.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:36.741 region:rollup2
I HAD TO IT'S A QUESTION.

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:38.910 region:rollup2
SO.

00:44:36.741 --> 00:44:40.978 region:rollup2
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT NO

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:42.246 region:rollup2
ONE AGENCY IS GONNA SOLVE THESE

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:44.115 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS ALONE.

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:44.649 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE WORKED

00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:45.983 region:rollup2
HARD TO WORK WITHIN THEIR

00:44:44.649 --> 00:44:48.719 region:rollup2
REGIONS.

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:50.354 region:rollup2
IT'S A USEFUL QUESTION TO TO

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:52.790 region:rollup2
EXAMINE SHOULD THE STATE HAVE

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:55.092 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF OVER ARCHING SAFETY

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:56.160 region:rollup2
AGENCY WHAT WOULD IT DO HOW WILL

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:58.095 region:rollup2
IT TAKE CARE --

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.164 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE TO THE EXPERTISE

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:01.966 region:rollup2
PACIFIC DIVISIONS WITH SPECIFIC

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:02.533 region:rollup2
OF PURPOSE I MEAN.

00:45:01.966 --> 00:45:04.101 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT'S A USEFUL

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:05.903 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:08.806 region:rollup2
ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOR THE

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:11.108 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WE ARE GETTING BETTER

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:13.110 region:rollup2
STRONGER AND WILL CONTINUE TO

00:45:11.108 --> 00:45:15.746 region:rollup2
GET.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:16.314 region:rollup2
HOME MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF

00:45:15.746 --> 00:45:17.515 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DEALING WITH THESE

00:45:16.314 --> 00:45:19.083 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:45:17.515 --> 00:45:20.351 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:21.886 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE.

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:24.422 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:26.557 region:rollup2
ENOUGH OR IF YOU FEEL THAT THERE

00:45:24.422 --> 00:45:29.327 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A DIFFERENT MODEL.

00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:30.995 region:rollup2
AGAIN I DEFERRED THE CENTER FOR

00:45:29.327 --> 00:45:32.196 region:rollup2
I COULD IF YOU HAVE A CLOSING

00:45:30.995 --> 00:45:34.465 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ON THAT ON I WANT TO

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:36.167 region:rollup2
TURN TO CENTER HUESO AND THEN

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:37.301 region:rollup2
SUMA MEMORYYES.

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:38.970 region:rollup2
THEY HAD A CERTAINLY I I HAVE

00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:40.671 region:rollup2
MANY QUESTIONS PERHAPS I CAN ASK

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.973 region:rollup2
HIM AT SOME OTHER POINT I DID

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.207 region:rollup2
WANNA JUST THAT THE POINT TO

00:45:41.973 --> 00:45:46.210 region:rollup2
THIS IS THAT.

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:48.512 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE LIMITED OF RESOURCES

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:51.515 region:rollup2
YOUR JOB HAS PRIMARILY BEEN TO

00:45:48.512 --> 00:45:52.850 region:rollup2
DETERMINE APPROPRIATE RATES --

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:55.920 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK AT THIS POINT N

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:57.722 region:rollup2
TIME SOMEHOW OR OTHER IN GRANTED

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.624 region:rollup2
UTILITIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY

00:45:57.722 --> 00:46:02.426 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY FIRE BUT

00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:02.893 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DO HAVE.

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.695 region:rollup2
A THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

00:46:02.893 --> 00:46:06.564 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE I SUSPECT THE THOMAS

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:08.532 region:rollup2
FIRE WILL SEE THAT THERE HAS

00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:10.434 region:rollup2
BEEN SOME UTILITY ALTHOUGH WE

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:12.169 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW YET WHAT IT IS BUT

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:13.871 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD OF GOOD

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:16.641 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD PERHAPS --

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:18.376 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO TAKE OF THIS

00:46:16.641 --> 00:46:19.276 region:rollup2
SITUATION AND SOMEBODY'SGOT TO

00:46:18.376 --> 00:46:20.645 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THE UTILITY

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:23.314 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

00:46:20.645 --> 00:46:26.217 region:rollup2
THE ANNA ADOPT BEST PRACTICES

00:46:23.314 --> 00:46:27.718 region:rollup2
AND ARE HELD FEET TO THE FIRE --

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:29.553 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING SURE

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:31.122 region:rollup2
THAT THEY IMPLEMENT THESE BEST

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:32.790 region:rollup2
PRACTICES BECAUSE?

00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:35.126 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS A COME RUNNING

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:36.627 region:rollup2
TO THE P. YOU SEE IN ASKING FOR

00:46:35.126 --> 00:46:38.329 region:rollup2
ACCOMMODATIONS O THAT THEY CAN

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.764 region:rollup2
INCREASE RATES BECAUSE THEY'VE

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:41.666 region:rollup2
HAD THESE INCIDENTS?

00:46:39.764 --> 00:46:44.368 region:rollup2
AND YET IT'S SORT OF LIKE WHEN

00:46:41.666 --> 00:46:46.570 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A THE THE FELLOW WHO

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:48.372 region:rollup2
KILLS HIS A PARENTS COMING TO

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.640 region:rollup2
COURT AND BEGGING FOR MERCY AT

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:52.576 region:rollup2
THAT BEFORE THE JUDGE BECAUSE

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.011 region:rollup2
HE'S AN ORPHAN.

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:56.247 region:rollup2
I MEAN IT'S IT'S A IT'S A

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:57.915 region:rollup2
SIMILAR SITUATION IT SEEMS TO ME

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:59.417 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE UTILITY COMPANIES.

00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:01.252 region:rollup2
THAT EITHER AREN'T BEING

00:46:59.417 --> 00:47:03.487 region:rollup2
REQUIRED --

00:47:01.252 --> 00:47:04.955 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN BEST PRACTICES DON'T

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:07.158 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THEM THAT IMPORTANT

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:09.393 region:rollup2
MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT ARE

00:47:07.158 --> 00:47:11.696 region:rollup2
CONTRARY TO BEST PRACTICES AND

00:47:09.393 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
SO MARK MY QUESTION IS HOWDO WE

00:47:11.696 --> 00:47:14.699 region:rollup2
FIX THAT PROBLEM AND A LOOK

00:47:13.431 --> 00:47:16.434 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:47:14.699 --> 00:47:18.202 region:rollup2
TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THAT.

00:47:16.434 --> 00:47:19.704 region:rollup2
THANK YOU PEN PART OF THIS

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:21.138 region:rollup2
PROCESS WILL ALLOW US TO PUT

00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:21.672 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SPOTLIGHT ON SOME OF

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:22.840 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.408 region:rollup2
RAISED.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.743 region:rollup2
SENATE HUESO THANK YOU MISTER

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:28.045 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN AND JUST FOLLOWING UP

00:47:25.743 --> 00:47:29.146 region:rollup2
ON YOUR COMMENTS I MEAN THAT --

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:30.948 region:rollup2
DOT THAT PARTY THAT'S

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:32.216 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ACTION IS

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:33.317 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE US LEGISLATURE AND

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:34.251 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR.

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:36.053 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE HAVE THE

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:38.656 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WITHOUT CREATING A NEW

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:39.256 region:rollup2
AGENCY AND A NEW NEW DIRECTIVE I

00:47:38.656 --> 00:47:40.891 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARY I

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:42.293 region:rollup2
MEAN WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE PVC

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:44.295 region:rollup2
WE HAVE CAL FIRE.

00:47:42.293 --> 00:47:45.863 region:rollup2
WE HAVE --

00:47:44.295 --> 00:47:48.065 region:rollup2
DID TO DEPARTMENT FORESTRY.

00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:51.068 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES OUT

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:53.571 region:rollup2
THERE TO AT LEAST BEGIN --

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:54.972 region:rollup2
A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT LIKE --

00:47:53.571 --> 00:47:56.674 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT PICKER SAID IT'S CAN

00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:58.809 region:rollup2
REQUIRE EVERYBODY.

00:47:56.674 --> 00:48:01.112 region:rollup2
DOING A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR PART

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:02.079 region:rollup2
AND JUST JUST TO I HAVE A

00:48:01.112 --> 00:48:05.349 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT I'M A FULL PLATE

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:06.817 region:rollup2
BUT IN SAN DIEGO IT JUST WASN'T

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:07.918 region:rollup2
THE P. YOU SEE AND IT JUST

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.620 region:rollup2
WASN'T S. TEACH YOU NEED.

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup2
I WAS ON THE COUNCIL BACK THEN

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.923 region:rollup2
AND WE WORKED ON A VERY

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:13.858 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE BREAST MANAGEMENT.

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:17.895 region:rollup2
POLICY WITH THE CITY.

00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:19.430 region:rollup2
REQUIRE TO CLEAR --

00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:21.232 region:rollup2
FUEL AROUND THEIR PROPERTIES AND

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:23.601 region:rollup2
THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE THING

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:25.102 region:rollup2
TO ASK OF PEOPLE. TO TAKE

00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:27.338 region:rollup2
PROACTIVE MEASURES TO REDUCE THE

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:28.873 region:rollup2
RISK IN AROUND THE PROPERTY.

00:48:27.338 --> 00:48:29.974 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT

00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:31.409 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE.

00:48:29.974 --> 00:48:33.644 region:rollup2
I MEAN TODAY WE'RE DISCUSSING

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.745 region:rollup2
THE MEAT AND POTATOES.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:36.347 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT TODAY'S A COMMITTEE

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:38.315 region:rollup2
HEARING IS REALLY THE MEAT AND

00:48:36.347 --> 00:48:39.717 region:rollup2
POTATOES SUPPORT THIS WHOLE.

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:41.986 region:rollup2
DEBATE ON AN AND EVERYTHING I

00:48:39.717 --> 00:48:43.654 region:rollup2
THINK THE HE THAT THE PRINCIPLE

00:48:41.986 --> 00:48:45.556 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT WE SHOULD.

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.924 region:rollup2
PRESENT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR

00:48:45.556 --> 00:48:48.959 region:rollup2
APPROVAL AND THE GOVERNOR

00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:49.794 region:rollup2
BOTTOMLEY FOR SIGNATURE.

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.795 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO COME FROM THIS

00:48:49.794 --> 00:48:53.297 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND IT'S GOING TO

00:48:50.795 --> 00:48:54.999 region:rollup2
INVOLVE --

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:55.900 region:rollup2
HAVING THE PC DURING THE WORK

00:48:54.999 --> 00:48:58.302 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE CONTINUING TO DO

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:59.703 region:rollup2
WHAT THE WHAT THE PROVIDERS.

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:01.672 region:rollup2
THAT AT THAT LEVEL.

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:04.708 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO HAVING.

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:08.012 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY WORK CHU CHU AND THE

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:10.247 region:rollup2
AND THE CITY'S WORK [inaudible]

00:49:08.012 --> 00:49:13.551 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:15.319 region:rollup2
LOCAL PROGRAM THAT ON THAT'LL.

00:49:13.551 --> 00:49:16.387 region:rollup2
HOLD PROPERTY OWNERS ACCOUNTABLE

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:17.755 region:rollup2
FOR CLEARING.

00:49:16.387 --> 00:49:18.856 region:rollup2
THAT STUFF THAT'S ON THEIR

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:19.890 region:rollup2
PROPERTY IN HOLDING THE

00:49:18.856 --> 00:49:22.326 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR CLEAN

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.894 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S IN OUR PROP.

00:49:22.326 --> 00:49:25.896 region:rollup2
AND I WAS GONNA ASK YOU KNOW I

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:28.532 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:30.267 region:rollup2
I I LOVE THE TO WIRE.

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:32.203 region:rollup2
THE THE UTILITY UNDERGROUND YOU

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:34.738 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE

00:49:32.203 --> 00:49:36.874 region:rollup2
PROGRAM BUT IT'S MAINLY.

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:38.309 region:rollup2
AYE A PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES A

00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:39.543 region:rollup2
STATICS REMOVING POWER LINES

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:41.445 region:rollup2
FROM

00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:42.847 region:rollup2
OF THE THE THE VIEW BUT IT'S

00:49:41.445 --> 00:49:44.815 region:rollup2
VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM I'M VERY

00:49:42.847 --> 00:49:46.617 region:rollup2
CONCERNED.

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:47.818 region:rollup2
THAT ANYTHING THAT WE DO HERE'S

00:49:46.617 --> 00:49:48.452 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE --

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:51.922 region:rollup2
AT AN IMPACT OF INCREASING RATES

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:53.891 region:rollup2
--

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:55.593 region:rollup2
CAN WE CAN WE PRIORITIZE IS IT

00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:58.195 region:rollup2
TOO LATE TO SAY I I WANT TO

00:49:55.593 --> 00:50:00.764 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON SAFETY AND ANYTHING

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:01.332 region:rollup2
THAT REPAIRS ARE PAIN INTO --

00:50:00.764 --> 00:50:04.735 region:rollup2
WAY TO REDIRECT AND I DON'T

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:06.237 region:rollup2
MEAN.

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:09.273 region:rollup2
USE UNDERGROUND FUNDS SOME

00:50:06.237 --> 00:50:10.508 region:rollup2
SAYING ELIMINATE THAT PROGRAM.

00:50:09.273 --> 00:50:12.843 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT CREATES A SAVINGS AND

00:50:10.508 --> 00:50:14.912 region:rollup2
THAT SAVINGS --

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:17.581 region:rollup2
WE CAN SUBSTITUTE TO CREATE A

00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:20.251 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM STATEWIDE.

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:22.653 region:rollup2
THAT IN SOME INSTANCES WHAT WILL

00:50:20.251 --> 00:50:24.288 region:rollup2
RESULT IN AND MAKING INVESTMENTS

00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:25.589 region:rollup2
SUBTLE STRAIGHTEN THE GREATEST

00:50:24.288 --> 00:50:27.458 region:rollup2
AT SOMETHING.

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:28.092 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN WORK ON HOW

00:50:27.458 --> 00:50:31.829 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE IS THE UNDERGONE A

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:35.266 region:rollup2
PER ONLY SPECIFIC AREAS OR IS

00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:36.400 region:rollup2
THAT STATE WIDER.

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:37.968 region:rollup2
SO.

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:40.404 region:rollup2
THEY'RE UNDER BRANDING PROGRAM

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:41.205 region:rollup2
IS REALLY SORT OF A CREDIT TO

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:44.875 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY

00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:46.243 region:rollup2
MATCH AND IT REALLY WAS BUILT

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:48.412 region:rollup2
AROUND AN AESTHETIC CALL.

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:49.313 region:rollup2
IT WAS STILL A STATUTE ACTUALLY

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:50.447 region:rollup2
TIME --

00:50:49.313 --> 00:50:52.416 region:rollup2
DETERMINES THAT THIS IS

00:50:50.447 --> 00:50:55.085 region:rollup2
NECESSARY FOR PURPOSES OF

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:56.620 region:rollup2
BEAUTIFICATION IS STARTED OUT AS

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:58.989 region:rollup2
HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION PROGRAM.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:00.190 region:rollup2
SO THE UTILITIES ISSUE CREDITS

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:01.892 region:rollup2
TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BASED

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:04.061 region:rollup2
ON THEIR POPULATION.

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:05.663 region:rollup2
AND THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL

00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:07.231 region:rollup2
ACCUMULATE THE CREDITS AND IN A

00:51:05.663 --> 00:51:08.132 region:rollup2
MATCH IT WITH THEIR OWN DOLLARS

00:51:07.231 --> 00:51:09.833 region:rollup2
IN WHEN THEY'RE READY TO

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:11.368 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND CERTAIN PART OF THE

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:13.304 region:rollup2
STATE SO HERE IN SACRAMENTO FOR

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:15.272 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE --

00:51:13.304 --> 00:51:17.308 region:rollup2
THE CITY WORKED WITH A MUNICIPAL

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:18.509 region:rollup2
UTILITY TO UNDERGROUND MOST OF

00:51:17.308 --> 00:51:20.077 region:rollup2
THE DOWNTOWN THAT'S WHY YOU

00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:22.613 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE A LOT OF POOL SOME

00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:24.949 region:rollup2
WIRES AROUND STATE CAPITOL --

00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:27.451 region:rollup2
THERE SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY --

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:28.953 region:rollup2
IT IT IS NOT A TRULY DESIGNED TO

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:31.355 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROGRAM.

00:51:28.953 --> 00:51:33.891 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO SAY THAT IT'S SOMETHING

00:51:31.355 --> 00:51:35.259 region:rollup2
THAT IS EXPENSIVE SO WE THE

00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:36.927 region:rollup2
COSTS RANGE --

00:51:35.259 --> 00:51:39.430 region:rollup2
FOR UPWARDS OF TEN MILLION

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:44.668 region:rollup2
DOLLARS DOWN PER MILE FOR UNDER

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:45.269 region:rollup2
GROUNDING VERSUS. TEN THOUSAND

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:46.170 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR TOLL

00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:47.838 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE FOLKS

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:51.342 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:54.178 region:rollup2
SO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES OF

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:55.746 region:rollup2
OF WIRES TO ONE POINT FOR FOR ME

00:51:54.178 --> 00:51:57.514 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE FOR ME AND POLLS.

00:51:55.746 --> 00:51:59.483 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FAIRLY EXPENSIVE

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:01.452 region:rollup2
PROPOSITION TO SWITCH OVER ALL

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:03.320 region:rollup2
OF ONCE SO PEOPLE SHOULD BE VERY

00:52:01.452 --> 00:52:05.055 region:rollup2
JUDICIOUS ABOUT WHERE WE DO THAT

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.557 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S ACTUALLY A

00:52:05.055 --> 00:52:08.258 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT FIRE RISK.

00:52:06.557 --> 00:52:10.361 region:rollup2
AND WHERE THIS IS THE BEST

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:12.096 region:rollup2
TECHNIQUE SO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:52:10.361 --> 00:52:13.564 region:rollup2
EDISON HAS COME FORWARD WITH

00:52:12.096 --> 00:52:15.899 region:rollup2
METAL POLES.

00:52:13.564 --> 00:52:17.468 region:rollup2
STRONGER AND FIRE RESISTANT FOR

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:18.869 region:rollup2
SOME AREAS AND SO THAT'S SAID A

00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:20.704 region:rollup2
TECHNIQUE THAT THEY'RE USING IT

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:22.306 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEIR THEIR MORE

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:25.175 region:rollup2
MOUNTAINOUS AREAS --

00:52:22.306 --> 00:52:26.210 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO UNDO PROGRAM AND AS

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.644 region:rollup2
THAT BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.346 region:rollup2
ADD.

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:30.447 region:rollup2
YOU COULD DO THAT TO THE TABLE I

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:32.182 region:rollup2
MEAN HAD PUT THAT ON THE TABLE

00:52:30.447 --> 00:52:33.817 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT AS PART OF SOMETHING

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:35.386 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD CONSIDER.

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:36.954 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GONNA TAKE SOME COST

00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:38.055 region:rollup2
SAVING MEASURES THAT COULD BE IN

00:52:36.954 --> 00:52:40.391 region:rollup2
A COST SAVING MEASURE THAT CAN

00:52:38.055 --> 00:52:42.159 region:rollup2
ALLOW US [inaudible]

00:52:40.391 --> 00:52:44.528 region:rollup2
CHIU.

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:46.163 region:rollup2
SUBSTITUTE A DIFFERENT FUND

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:48.298 region:rollup2
RAISING MEASURE THAT WILL HELP

00:52:46.163 --> 00:52:49.933 region:rollup2
US ADDRESS.

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:51.268 region:rollup2
BOB BRUSH MANAGEMENT.

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:52.870 region:rollup2
HELP THE COMPANY'S ADDRESS PRESS

MANAGEMENT HELP [inaudible]

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.840 region:rollup2
HELP --

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:58.809 region:rollup2
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE SOME

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.577 region:rollup2
KIND GRANT PROGRAM IF WE'RE

00:52:58.809 --> 00:53:02.479 region:rollup2
GONNA COME IN IS THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:03.547 region:rollup2
TELL THE COUNTIES WE WANT YOU --

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:04.915 region:rollup2
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN ON HOW

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:06.950 region:rollup2
YOU CAN REMOVE THIS BRUSH WE'RE

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:07.117 region:rollup2
GONNA GO TO CAL FIRE SAY WE NEED

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:08.585 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:10.654 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY.

00:53:08.585 --> 00:53:12.656 region:rollup2
WHAT DID THAT THE FUEL AREAS ARE

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:14.691 region:rollup2
AND AND WE WANNA WORK

00:53:12.656 --> 00:53:16.093 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUSLY TO REDUCE THAT

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:18.495 region:rollup2
FUEL WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE

00:53:16.093 --> 00:53:19.363 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCE FOR TO DO THAT?

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:21.165 region:rollup2
DOES THAT MEAN WE'RE GOING TO

00:53:19.363 --> 00:53:22.866 region:rollup2
ADD ANOTHER COSTS TO RATEPAYERS

00:53:21.165 --> 00:53:24.601 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:27.471 region:rollup2
I'M NINETY PREACHER PARTICULARLY

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:28.806 region:rollup2
IN FAVOR OF THAT.

00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:31.075 region:rollup2
UNLESS WE CAN FIND A WAY.

00:53:28.806 --> 00:53:31.442 region:rollup2
TO INJECT SOME SAVINGS INTO THE

00:53:31.075 --> 00:53:32.643 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:35.012 region:rollup2
AMP AND IT WILL TRULY BEGIN TO

00:53:32.643 --> 00:53:37.114 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE.

00:53:35.012 --> 00:53:38.849 region:rollup2
SO SENATOR FEW THAT YOU THINK

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:39.950 region:rollup2
THAT'S VIABLE WE COULD MAKE IT

00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:43.387 region:rollup2
WORK OKAY [inaudible]

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:44.888 region:rollup2
AND AN I GENERALLY I THINK THE

00:53:43.387 --> 00:53:45.856 region:rollup2
POLICY SHOULD.

00:53:44.888 --> 00:53:48.392 region:rollup2
THAT WE COME UP WITH SHOULD

00:53:45.856 --> 00:53:49.893 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE COUNTIES TO CITIES.

00:53:48.392 --> 00:53:51.595 region:rollup2
SHOULD INCLUDE CAL FIRE SHOULD

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:52.162 region:rollup2
INCLUDE INCLUDE THE FORESTRY

00:53:51.595 --> 00:53:53.263 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.531 region:rollup2
BEAT.

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:56.600 region:rollup2
DEVELOP I MEAN EVEN EVEN THE

00:53:54.531 --> 00:54:00.871 region:rollup2
LUMBER INDUSTRY.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:02.740 region:rollup2
IF IF WORK CUTTEN DOWN --

00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:03.907 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT'S USABLE.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.776 region:rollup2
WHY NOT?

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:07.578 region:rollup2
WHY NOT PROVIDE THAT TO THE

00:54:05.776 --> 00:54:09.580 region:rollup2
MILLS SAYS A SOURCE OF?

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:11.181 region:rollup2
BUT WHERE WHERE WE CAN --

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:12.883 region:rollup2
ENOUGH SEND THE STUFF.

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:14.218 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

00:54:12.883 --> 00:54:15.185 region:rollup2
BIOMASS.

00:54:14.218 --> 00:54:18.422 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT ENOUGH

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:20.257 region:rollup2
BIOMASS PLANTS. TO TO CONSUME

00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:22.760 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS MATERIAL AND NOT ALL

00:54:20.257 --> 00:54:25.329 region:rollup2
OF IT NEEDS TO BE BURNED OR

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:27.664 region:rollup2
PROCESSED WE COULDN'T.

00:54:25.329 --> 00:54:30.134 region:rollup2
FIND DIFFERENT WAYS. TO MOLD

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:32.436 region:rollup2
SHARED OR TURNED INTO LUMBER OR

00:54:30.134 --> 00:54:34.338 region:rollup2
TURN IT INTO --

00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:37.407 region:rollup2
BIOMASS FUEL [inaudible]

00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:39.243 region:rollup2
BUT SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE DONE

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.776 region:rollup2
THAT ON A VERY.

00:54:39.243 --> 00:54:42.579 region:rollup2
COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:44.047 region:rollup2
SCALE.

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:44.648 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED I WOULD SAY.

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:47.417 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE US

00:54:44.648 --> 00:54:48.952 region:rollup2
--

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:50.287 region:rollup2
TO TO WE LOOK AT OUR PRIORITIES

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:51.789 region:rollup2

00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:53.590 region:rollup2
THIS POINT.

00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:55.292 region:rollup2

WE HAVE TO MAKE ARE VICTIMS HOLE

00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:53.310 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:54.811 region:rollup2
ONE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WAYS

00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:56.546 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT THESE WILD OF THESE

00:56:54.811 --> 00:56:57.648 region:rollup2
FIRES.

FROM STARTING IN THAT WE HAVE TO

00:56:57.648 --> 00:56:59.182 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE

00:56:58.649 --> 00:57:01.618 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T GROW IF THEY DO

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:03.086 region:rollup2
START.

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:04.988 region:rollup2
BUT SAFETY WE TALKED ABOUT

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:05.923 region:rollup2
SAFETY IT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.923 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:08.759 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT THE

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:10.127 region:rollup2
COST.

00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:11.628 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT --

00:57:10.127 --> 00:57:13.330 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE

HERE BUT A LOT OF THAT THAT THAT

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:18.502 region:rollup2
THAT THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:20.470 region:rollup2
AROUND THE COST. TO TO TO TO THE

00:57:18.502 --> 00:57:22.139 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:24.174 region:rollup2
THAT CANNOT BE OUR FIRST

00:57:22.139 --> 00:57:25.609 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:27.277 region:rollup2

TO DO TO STOP THESE FROM

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:34.885 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AGAIN.

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:36.386 region:rollup2
AND PICKED UP THE LAST HEARING

00:57:34.885 --> 00:57:37.854 region:rollup2
IN THEM DEED NOW HERE FOR THE

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:39.222 region:rollup2
SECOND HEARING.

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:40.424 region:rollup2
IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:42.192 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PLAN IS

00:57:40.424 --> 00:57:44.661 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE IF WE ALREADY KNOW

00:57:42.192 --> 00:57:45.862 region:rollup2
THAT I IT THEM SAN DIEGO.

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:48.498 region:rollup2
PUT THE PLAN TOGETHER THEY

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:49.966 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED IT WAS A ONE BILLION

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:51.935 region:rollup2
DOLLAR INVESTMENT.

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:53.136 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

00:57:51.935 --> 00:57:55.272 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE RIGHT NOTHING IS

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:56.073 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT IT

00:57:55.272 --> 00:57:57.941 region:rollup2
WAS A TEN YEAR.

00:57:56.073 --> 00:57:59.943 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:01.745 region:rollup2
SO THEY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS TEN

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:02.679 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO AND BEEN WORKING ON IT

00:58:01.745 --> 00:58:05.582 region:rollup2
INVESTING.

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:07.517 region:rollup2
YOU AUTHORIZE THEM TO TO TO

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:09.019 region:rollup2
CHARGE THE RATE PAYERS TO SO

00:58:07.517 --> 00:58:09.986 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN PUT THIS PLAN

00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:11.254 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:12.889 region:rollup2
WHY AREN'T THE OTHER UTILITIES

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:14.091 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS?

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:15.826 region:rollup2
WIRED THINK FIGURING OUT HOW

00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:18.095 region:rollup2
THEY INVEST THEIR MONEY TO MAKE

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:20.364 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THEIR RATE PAYERS.

00:58:18.095 --> 00:58:21.832 region:rollup2
ARE SAFE.

00:58:20.364 --> 00:58:24.234 region:rollup2
THAT IS OF GREAT GREAT CONCERN

00:58:21.832 --> 00:58:25.802 region:rollup2
TO ME.

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:27.070 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT DOES IT IS IT

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:27.371 region:rollup2
WHEN I LOOK AT THE PLAN

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.306 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:58:27.371 --> 00:58:30.674 region:rollup2

00:59:53.857 --> 00:59:58.695 region:rollup2
ADVANCED OF PLAYER CAPABILITIES

00:59:55.792 --> 01:00:00.130 region:rollup2
IN ONE VERY SPECIFIC AREA AROUND

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:02.065 region:rollup2
OH WEATHER PREDICTION.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:03.533 region:rollup2
ALMOST BLADES THE ARE NOT THE

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:05.869 region:rollup2
ONLY ONES WHO HAVE THAT

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:07.604 region:rollup2
CAPABILITY IT BOTH OF THE CSE E.

01:00:05.869 --> 01:00:09.172 region:rollup2
AND P. JEANNIE --

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.574 region:rollup2
IN INVESTING WHETHER ANALYTICS

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:12.409 region:rollup2
AS WELL THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:12.976 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE --

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:15.779 region:rollup2
NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:17.547 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:18.648 region:rollup2
WELL BUT I KNOW THERE ARE ALSO

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:20.817 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:22.619 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT UTILITIES FOCUS ON

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:24.454 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE VEGETATION

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.956 region:rollup2
AND THE CHALLENGES THAT P.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.190 region:rollup2
JEANNIE FACES A VERY VERY

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:28.592 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AND FROM CHALLENGES

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.727 region:rollup2
INSANE GAO.

01:00:28.592 --> 01:00:32.429 region:rollup2
SO HOME REPLICATING THE EXACT

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.630 region:rollup2
THIS IT SEEMED YOU GO SOLUTION

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:34.865 region:rollup2
ALL OVER THE STATE DOESN'T

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.233 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THE ANSWER AND

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:38.001 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:39.102 region:rollup2
WE WORK ON IN MY GROUP.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:41.071 region:rollup2
IS REALLY ON THE STANDING THE

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:42.739 region:rollup2
SPECIFICS OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:44.007 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE DOING

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:45.909 region:rollup2
AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:47.043 region:rollup2
HELPING THEM THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:48.645 region:rollup2
TO SAY QUE.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:50.547 region:rollup2
LIKE LET'S DISCUSS WHAT BE WHAT

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:52.015 region:rollup2
THINGS YOU GOOD THAT HERE WHY IT

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:53.583 region:rollup2
WOULD IT WOULDN'T WORK IN P.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:55.619 region:rollup2
GENIUS OR IS SEIZE TERRITORY

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.019 region:rollup2
CALLED YOU TWEAK IT TO MAKE IT

01:00:55.619 --> 01:00:58.922 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:00:56.019 --> 01:01:00.590 region:rollup2
HOME SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:02.125 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE GOES ALL I ASK YOU

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.560 region:rollup2
FIRST I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND I

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:05.795 region:rollup2
WOULD NEVER.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.699 region:rollup2
IMPLY THAT WHATEVER WORKS IN SAN

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:10.700 region:rollup2
DIEGO IS GOING TO WORK IN

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.801 region:rollup2
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.335 region:rollup2
I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT I WOULD

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.904 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT IF DAD IS MY

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:15.572 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:17.841 region:rollup2
I WILL BECOME THE EXPERT AND I

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:19.509 region:rollup2
WILL SEE WHAT WORKS IN SAN DIEGO

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.278 region:rollup2
AND IF IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.746 region:rollup2
WHY AM I GOING TO REINVENT THE

01:01:21.278 --> 01:01:24.514 region:rollup2
WHEEL WHEN SOMEBODY'S ALREADY

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:25.882 region:rollup2
GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:27.717 region:rollup2
FIGURED OUT WHAT WORKS THE CAME

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:29.152 region:rollup2
OUT THAT'S LIKE A WORK IN THIS

01:01:27.717 --> 01:01:31.888 region:rollup2
AREA SO WHERE DO WE TWEAK IT.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:33.823 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL WHO'S DOING

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:36.760 region:rollup2
IT IRWIN IS A BEING OF THE THAT

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:39.129 region:rollup2
THE GUTS OF THE FIRE SAFETY

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.664 region:rollup2
PLANS WITH THE VEGETATION

01:01:39.129 --> 01:01:41.765 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT STANDARD THAT WE

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:45.068 region:rollup2
ADOPTED.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:46.970 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OTHER PIECES THAT WE WE

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:50.740 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY MONITOR --

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:53.276 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF ADVANCING --

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:56.246 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:57.380 region:rollup2
SAFETY IN OUR GENERAL ORDER

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:59.916 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE RELATING TO OVERHEAD

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.318 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR POLLS.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:03.086 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A VARIETY OF OTHER

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:05.322 region:rollup2
THINGS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:07.324 region:rollup2
YOU BRING IT TOGETHER IN A WAY.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:10.093 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY CONTINUES TO

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:12.896 region:rollup2
ADVANCE YEAR TO YEAR HOW DO WE

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:14.331 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY COM SET THAT FRAMEWORK

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.765 region:rollup2
WHO ARE THE RULES BUT SEE IT

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:17.133 region:rollup2
COME TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT WE

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:19.502 region:rollup2
ALL KNOW ROYCE HALL WORKING

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:20.437 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO PREVENT FIRES.

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:23.974 region:rollup2
THE GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:25.108 region:rollup2
FOR OVERHEAD SO AS A LOT OF

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:26.576 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OUT OF FIRE HAZARD

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:28.178 region:rollup2
AREAS.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:30.413 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A QUESTION HOW DO HOW DO

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:32.682 region:rollup2
WE REALLY USE THAT ADAPT THAT IN

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:34.384 region:rollup2
HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREA SOON AND

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:36.052 region:rollup2
ENDEAVOR BEEN AREAS WE USE THAT

01:02:34.384 --> 01:02:37.587 region:rollup2
PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING

01:02:36.052 --> 01:02:39.022 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE TREE MANAGEMENT FOR

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.790 region:rollup2
ELECTROCUTION.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:42.592 region:rollup2
WE DO THAT TO PREVENT THE LINE

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.126 region:rollup2
DROPS IT THEY CAN SOMETIMES IT

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.061 region:rollup2
ACT LIKE TO KEEP PROPERTY

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:46.529 region:rollup2
OWNERS.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:49.032 region:rollup2
SO THERE THE I'M JUST SAYING

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:51.067 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO

01:02:49.032 --> 01:02:52.869 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE AREAS WHERE ALL

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:54.304 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS COME TOGETHER

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:56.940 region:rollup2
AROUND FIRE HAZARDS.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:59.075 region:rollup2
IAN WHERE ELSE CAN WE BEGIN TO

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.310 region:rollup2
LEARN AS WE START TO SEE HOW IT

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:01.444 region:rollup2
WORKS TOGETHER.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:03.980 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT'S A GOOD TO BE THE

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:05.815 region:rollup2
CORE OF THE FIRST ROUNDS OF THE

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.384 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT PLANS.

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:10.120 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE AS WE BRING

01:03:07.384 --> 01:03:11.955 region:rollup2
EVALUATORS AND AND THEY START TO

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.623 region:rollup2
REPLICATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.858 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES IS THEY BRING

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.359 region:rollup2
THINGS FORWARD.

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:18.461 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:21.598 region:rollup2
LEVELS I'M I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF

01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:22.966 region:rollup2
SAYING THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT.

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:25.268 region:rollup2
MIKE BY I THINK THAT IT'S

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:28.204 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO CONSTANTLY LEARN

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:29.673 region:rollup2
AND TO ADVANCE SO THAT A RULE

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:30.774 region:rollup2
DOESN'T BECOME A CEILING IT'S

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:32.142 region:rollup2
THE FLOOR.

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:33.843 region:rollup2
WE WILL START.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:35.178 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW I THINK

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:37.447 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IT'S NOT GOING

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:41.084 region:rollup2
TO BE PERFECT BUT WE WILL GET

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:42.552 region:rollup2
BETTER?

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:43.153 region:rollup2
AND IF MY LAST QUESTION

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:45.021 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GOES BACK

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:46.089 region:rollup2
--

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:50.093 region:rollup2
TO CENTER WHICH WAS TALKING

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:52.295 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS THE UNDERGROUND --

01:03:50.093 --> 01:03:53.797 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:55.865 region:rollup2
I RECOGNIZE HOME HOW EXPENSIVE

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:57.067 region:rollup2
IT IS.

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:59.269 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHEN WE HAVE NEW

01:03:57.067 --> 01:04:01.104 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS IS THAT SOMETHING

01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:04.708 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE INCLUDED SO THAT

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:07.844 region:rollup2
pINFRASTRUCTURE IS SET UP.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
SO IT IS GENERALLY BECOMING

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:11.281 region:rollup2
COMMON PRACTICE AND IN LAND USE

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:13.683 region:rollup2
--

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:15.018 region:rollup2
IN IN AN URBAN COURSE JUST

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.386 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HAVING

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.454 region:rollup2
POLLS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SO

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:19.689 region:rollup2
FILL YOU GO OUT TO NORTH

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:20.690 region:rollup2
NOTONOMUS HE'LL SEE THAT MOST OF

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.992 region:rollup2
THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS HAVE

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:24.894 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND IT EMPHASIS.

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:27.130 region:rollup2
HOLDER NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE SOUTH

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:28.198 region:rollup2
OF TOMAS BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:30.300 region:rollup2
WERE SMALLER THEY DIDN'TDO

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.735 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.270 region:rollup2
SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES.

01:04:31.735 --> 01:04:36.740 region:rollup2
ARE YOU TO HAVE MORE POLLS SO I

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:38.274 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S THE TREND IT'S LESS

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.944 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO HAPPEN WHERE YOU HAVE

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:42.812 region:rollup2
A LOT OF SMALL DEVELOPMENTS.

01:04:40.944 --> 01:04:44.948 region:rollup2
SPENDING INTO THE WILD DUH

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:46.516 region:rollup2
LEANDER BEEN INTERFACE --

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:48.218 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE FIRE HAZARD TO

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:50.053 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S ONLY TWO TO THREE

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:52.255 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS TOGETHER ONE

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:52.822 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:54.457 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THOSE PEOPLE ACTRESS

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:56.192 region:rollup2
CITY?

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:57.193 region:rollup2
PRINT AND SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.927 region:rollup2
DO THE UNDER GROUNDING ON THEIR

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:59.429 region:rollup2
OWN.

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:01.464 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MASTER PLAN

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:02.799 region:rollup2
DEVELOPER TO DO THAT AND THAT'S

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:04.300 region:rollup2
WHY TALK ABOUT NEW DEVELOPMENTS

01:05:02.799 --> 01:05:06.536 region:rollup2
SO NEW DEVELOPMENTS BUT THEY'RE

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.771 region:rollup2
GOING TO PROBABLY BE CLOSER AND

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.005 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS BECAUSE

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.340 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF MASTER

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.941 region:rollup2
PLAN DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGH HAZARD

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:14.110 region:rollup2
AREAS -- I

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:15.578 region:rollup2
SUSPECT WE'LL SEE THAT HOWEVER

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:17.313 region:rollup2
THEY ARE GOING TO FACE THEIR OWN

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.848 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AS THEY DO THAT AND

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:21.151 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:24.521 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THEM TO DO THAT THAT'S A

01:05:21.151 --> 01:05:26.156 region:rollup2
LOCAL LAND USE PREROGATIVE --

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:28.057 region:rollup2
ONE IF YOU PUT IT UNDERGROUND IF

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:30.026 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO REPAIR IT IT COSTS

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:32.195 region:rollup2
MORE AND TAKES LONGER TO FIX THE

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:33.496 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING HURRICANE SANDY IS

01:05:32.195 --> 01:05:35.064 region:rollup2
YOU CAN GET COMMUNITIES THAT

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.732 region:rollup2
HAVE POOLS AND WIRES ABOVE

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:36.866 region:rollup2
GROUND.

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:37.901 region:rollup2
COULD BE BACK IN SERVICE IN A

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:40.370 region:rollup2
WEEK [inaudible]

01:05:37.901 --> 01:05:41.805 region:rollup2
ON AVERAGE.

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:42.639 region:rollup2
AND HURRICANE SANDY THAT

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:44.007 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THERE WERE

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.942 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND THE AVERAGE IS MORE

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:47.377 region:rollup2
LIKE THREE MONTHS.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:49.212 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S BECAUSE PARTICULARLY

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:50.513 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SMART METERS TO PINPOINT

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:52.715 region:rollup2
THE BREAK.

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:54.350 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DIG UP A LOT. TO

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:55.919 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PROBLEM IS

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.320 region:rollup2
FOR YOU GET SMART METERS HE HAD

01:05:55.919 --> 01:05:58.221 region:rollup2
SMART METERS BICU THAT STILL

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.689 region:rollup2
DOES NOT.

01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:02.792 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT YOU GET EVERYBODY BACK

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:05.128 region:rollup2
IN SERVICE QUICKLY. TO AS WE SEE

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:06.930 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND WE SEE FIVE G.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:08.364 region:rollup2
COMING INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.199 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WANT THAT BROADBAND

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:10.567 region:rollup2
THROUGH ITS --

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:13.236 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S NOT TIED TO

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:13.770 region:rollup2
LOCATION.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:14.904 region:rollup2
YOU GOTTA HAVE POLLS ABOVE

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:17.373 region:rollup2
GROUND.

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:20.076 region:rollup2
SO DOES CONTAIN COMMUNITIES ARE

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:21.578 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO NOT.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.512 region:rollup2
CHOOSE UNDERGROUND A BECAUSE

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:24.147 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO HAVE THOSE POLLS

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:24.614 region:rollup2
FOR FIVE G..

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:27.250 region:rollup2
HERE WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:28.618 region:rollup2
BROADCAST.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:30.320 region:rollup2
THE MEANS GOOD BE ABOVE GROUND.

01:06:28.618 --> 01:06:31.654 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE FIBER

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.823 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO CARRY THE HIGH

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.691 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF OF DATA THAT PEOPLE

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.960 region:rollup2
ARE BROADCASTING.

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:38.728 region:rollup2
IN YOUR HAVE TO HAVE ELECTRICITY

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.797 region:rollup2
TO TO POWER THE BROADCAST.

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:42.765 region:rollup2
SO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DO CHOOSE TO

01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:45.435 region:rollup2
UNDERGROUND MAY BE GOING FOR

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:45.735 region:rollup2
GOING ON FIVE G. BROADBAND

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:48.271 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:52.809 region:rollup2
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:54.544 region:rollup2
THE PSEUDO. TO USE CHAIRMAN.

01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:55.178 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M LOOKING AT THE

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:56.012 region:rollup2
WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN RISK

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:57.680 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT RATE MAKING

01:06:56.012 --> 01:07:00.049 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT SO THE FIRST COLUMN

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:02.018 region:rollup2
IS.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:03.453 region:rollup2
WILDFIRE PREVENTION PLANNING SO.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.753 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE WHO USED TO BE

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:05.755 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:08.558 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FORESTRY. TO THOSE

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.858 region:rollup2
FORESTERS THAT ARE INSIDE OF

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:10.159 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.995 region:rollup2
POLITICALLY LIEU CITED OUT

01:07:10.159 --> 01:07:13.196 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES TO THEY'RE BASICALLY

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:15.632 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:17.400 region:rollup2
YOU ALL AND THE UTILITY TO COME

01:07:15.632 --> 01:07:18.401 region:rollup2
UP WITH A RISK ASSESSMENT IN A

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.802 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.771 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:23.306 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE FIRST COLUMN.

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:24.774 region:rollup2
THE SECOND HOMES THEN YOU

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:27.143 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY SS IS HOW MUCH IT'S

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:28.411 region:rollup2
GOING TO COST.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:30.446 region:rollup2
AND THEN YOU PASS THAT RATE.

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:32.382 region:rollup2
BONTA THE RATE PAYER AND THE

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:34.517 region:rollup2
UTILITIES ABLE TO THEN PRECOOKED

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.885 region:rollup2
THEIR COST TO DO THIS PLAN.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.820 region:rollup2
IN THE THIRD COLUMN IS

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:41.190 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.959 region:rollup2
SO WHEN A UTILITY DOES NOT

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.526 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THE PLAN.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:46.229 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF ACTION HAPPENS

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:48.264 region:rollup2
THEN?

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:51.668 region:rollup2
OR HAS THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:54.203 region:rollup2
NO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:56.306 region:rollup2
THE OTHER STUFF I LEFT IN YOUR

01:07:54.203 --> 01:07:58.041 region:rollup2
OFFICE THE IT IS THE THE ANSWERS

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:59.909 region:rollup2
TO SENATOR DODD'S QUESTIONS WE

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:02.679 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DETAIL SOME OF THE

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:05.114 region:rollup2
MAJOR FINDS THAT WE'VE GIVEN FOR

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:06.983 region:rollup2
FAILURE --

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:09.018 region:rollup2
TO PREVENT FIRES SO THREE OF

01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:09.786 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
FOUR OF THEM ARE FOR TELECOM

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:14.324 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS --

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.358 region:rollup2
THEY ARE FINE STAY ARE WHAT HOW

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.826 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY TRY TO DRIVE THE

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:18.494 region:rollup2
SOUTH.

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:19.796 region:rollup2
NOW THERE'S THE QUESTION WHAT D

01:08:18.494 --> 01:08:23.099 region:rollup2
YOU DO WITH THINGS THAT DON'T

01:08:19.796 --> 01:08:25.935 region:rollup2
RESULT IN SOME KIND OF HARM.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:27.503 region:rollup2
THE THAT DATED DAY VIOLATIONS

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.605 region:rollup2
THE THE FIX IT TICKETS AND SO

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:30.239 region:rollup2
THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:31.441 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING IN WORKING TO

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.942 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPROVE AND SO WE

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.744 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DETAILED SOME OF THE

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.878 region:rollup2
PROGRAM SO WE HAD. TO BUILD A

01:08:34.744 --> 01:08:38.181 region:rollup2
TRUE.

01:08:35.878 --> 01:08:38.781 region:rollup2
ESCALATING ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM

01:08:38.181 --> 01:08:41.284 region:rollup2
AT THE CPUC INNARAL OUR LETTER

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:43.152 region:rollup2
--

01:08:41.284 --> 01:08:44.988 region:rollup2
TO TO SENATOR DIED I THINK THE

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:46.756 region:rollup2
AREA THAT IS GOING TO ALWAYS BE

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:48.424 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC IS THAT WE HAVE A

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:50.159 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL.

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:52.862 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO COMPLY --

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:55.164 region:rollup2
COULD FORCE COMPLIANCE.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:57.066 region:rollup2
FOR THE ELECTRICITY AND THE

01:08:55.164 --> 01:08:58.434 region:rollup2
WATER YOU A UTILITIES WERE WE

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:59.836 region:rollup2
PAY WE AND THE GAS UTILITIES

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:01.137 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE THE FULL BOAT OF RATE

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:03.673 region:rollup2
MAKING.

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:05.641 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN APPLY THAT LESS SO

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:06.743 region:rollup2
FOR THE TELECOM FROM MINORS WHO

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:09.312 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO IN THAT POLL WHO ALSO

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:12.782 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES CONTRIBUTE TO FIRES.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:14.150 region:rollup2
SO WHAT HAT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:16.052 region:rollup2
IS REAL [inaudible]

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:18.588 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL.

01:09:16.052 --> 01:09:20.390 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT POWERS WE DON'T HAVE

01:09:18.588 --> 01:09:21.758 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO GO TO THE COURTS

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:24.560 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITHIN OUR

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:28.297 region:rollup2
OWN SYSTEM FOR THE MOST PART.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:30.533 region:rollup2
IT IT BE SAFE TO SAY THAT.

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:33.369 region:rollup2
MAY RECOUP THE THEY'VE BEEN PAID

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:35.738 region:rollup2
TO DO THE WORK SO THE INVESTOR.

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:37.373 region:rollup2
IS REAPING THE BENEFIT OF THAT

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.940 region:rollup2
RATE THAT WAS SET TO GO DO THE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:40.376 region:rollup2
WORK AND THE WORK NEVER GOT

01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:42.278 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:43.846 region:rollup2
AND THERE WAS NO.

01:09:42.278 --> 01:09:44.981 region:rollup2
A IT WAS A FIX IT TAKE IT

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:46.716 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL RECOUPING THAT

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:49.752 region:rollup2
COST AND SO IT WEARS THE

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.953 region:rollup2
INVESTOR ON THE HOOK --

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.722 region:rollup2
FOR SAYS THERE ARE --

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:55.291 region:rollup2
TWO COMPONENTS TO THIS THE ONE

01:09:52.722 --> 01:09:57.160 region:rollup2
THERE ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

01:09:55.291 --> 01:09:58.728 region:rollup2
ANDY A METHODOLOGY IN PLACE TO

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.397 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET SILLY IS

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:02.965 region:rollup2
SPENDING THE MONEY ON SAFETY.

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:05.168 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:06.803 region:rollup2
AND IF THE DOME AND OF SPENDING

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:08.404 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY WELL THAT GETS

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:09.872 region:rollup2
FLAGGED IN THE IN THE WAY THAT

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:12.475 region:rollup2
THE RATE MAKING WORKS IS

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:13.843 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NO ABILITY FOR THEM --

01:10:12.475 --> 01:10:15.812 region:rollup2
TO TO EARN THE RATE OF RETURN ON

01:10:13.843 --> 01:10:18.881 region:rollup2
THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY SERVED

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:20.383 region:rollup2
IN MACON SAFETY AT ALL SO THERE

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.884 region:rollup2
IS A GREAT MAKING COMPONENT

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.885 region:rollup2
AUDITS THE COST TO MAKE SURE

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:24.353 region:rollup2
THAT MONEY IS GOING WHERE IT'S

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:26.122 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE GOING AND

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:28.424 region:rollup2
FLAGGING AND IF IT IS AND AND

01:10:26.122 --> 01:10:32.295 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S THE SECONDARY.

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:34.597 region:rollup2
COMPONENT GOLF.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:36.132 region:rollup2
SO WITH THE RULES AND STANDARDS

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:37.300 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE SHE COULD

01:10:36.132 --> 01:10:38.534 region:rollup2
SPEND ALL THE MONEY THAT YOU

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:41.337 region:rollup2
WEREALLOCATED THE STILL BE OUT

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:42.138 region:rollup2
OF COMPLIANCE OR VICE VERSA YOU

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.539 region:rollup2
COULD THEORETICALLY BE IN

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:44.073 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE AND NOT HAVE SPENT

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.675 region:rollup2
THE MONEY RATES OF BOTH OF

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.709 region:rollup2
THOSE.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:47.677 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS COULD THEORETICALLY

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:49.579 region:rollup2
HAPPEN SO WE HAVE THE FROM

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:51.481 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE COST SIDE

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:53.950 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE NOTE PROGRAM THAT

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:54.817 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON THE DOG COMPLIANCE OF

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.486 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.953 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAKING SURE

01:10:56.486 --> 01:10:58.821 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED

01:10:56.953 --> 01:11:01.657 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED.

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:02.692 region:rollup2
IN ACCORDING CALM IN ACCORDING

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:04.961 region:rollup2
TO COATS.

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:07.530 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO GO WILL DEEPER WHEN

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:10.333 region:rollup2
WE FIND A UTILITY FOR FAILING TO

01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:11.968 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING WORK CAUSING HARM.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:13.436 region:rollup2
THAT GOES TO THE GENERAL FUND

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:15.104 region:rollup2
INCOMES FROM SHAREHOLDERS

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:24.780 region:rollup2
GENERALLY.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:25.615 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOESN'T GO BACK TO

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.215 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:26.549 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE HE GOES TO THE

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.150 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:27.350 region:rollup2
SO I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:28.050 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:28.351 region:rollup2
HEARING WHAT I THINK YOU SAID

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:28.684 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:30.019 region:rollup2
SO [inaudible]

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:32.722 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:33.856 region:rollup2
IF THEY'VE DONE THE WORK YOU GO

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:35.725 region:rollup2
OUT AND CHECK SOME A CHECKS TO

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:36.125 region:rollup2
SEE IF THE WORK'S BEEN DONE AND

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:37.727 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS BEEN.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.995 region:rollup2
MORE [inaudible]

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:41.030 region:rollup2
RECEIVED.

01:11:38.995 --> 01:11:42.398 region:rollup2
THEN COSTS CAN YOU'RE ALSO

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.499 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ALSO REVIEWING THE COST

01:11:42.398 --> 01:11:43.800 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME IS THAT CORRECT

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:45.268 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.969 region:rollup2
SO.

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:49.138 region:rollup2
DEPENDING UPON THE PROGRAM WE

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.339 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS REMINDED

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:52.508 region:rollup2
YOUR SPECIFIC FUNDS IN

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:54.877 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES TO SEE WHETHER IT

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:56.479 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DID COSTS THAT.

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:57.580 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THOUGH WILL DO SOME

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.916 region:rollup2
PLANNING.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.784 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE RATE CASE --

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:03.252 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AHEAD AND SAY THEY

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:05.388 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GONNA COST THIS MUCH

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:06.389 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY BEATS UP THOSE NUMBERS

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:07.523 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S AN AGREEMENT ON A

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:08.891 region:rollup2
PRICE PER WILL SAY.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:10.726 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU TRACK

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:12.862 region:rollup2
THAT IN A SPECIFIC KIND OF AN

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:14.063 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT AND THEN IN IN THE YEAR

01:12:12.862 --> 01:12:15.832 region:rollup2
TWO OR THREE YEARS WILL HOW WILL

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:16.365 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT ACCOUNT TO

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.333 region:rollup2
SEE WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.801 region:rollup2
COSTA.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.636 region:rollup2
AND THEN IF IT DIDN'T COST THAT

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:21.571 region:rollup2
MUCH THAT WE TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.905 region:rollup2
NEXT BUDGET.

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.607 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S AND THOSE KINDS OF

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:26.576 region:rollup2
TRACKING.

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:29.245 region:rollup2
THAT THE THIS IS IMPORTANT

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:32.381 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T GO OUT AND LOOK

01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:34.183 region:rollup2
AT EVERYTHING THE UTILITIES.

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:35.184 region:rollup2
TO THAT'S WHAT I THINK --

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.652 region:rollup2
THE SPELL SHINKO WAS TALKING

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:38.855 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHEN SHE SAID THE LABOR

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:40.423 region:rollup2
FORCE WHERE HE ECONOMIC

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:42.458 region:rollup2
REGULATOR SO WE TEND TO USE

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:44.227 region:rollup2
AUDITS A LOT.

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:46.128 region:rollup2
SO I TAX AGENCIES DON'T GO AND

01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:48.464 region:rollup2
CHECK YOUR BANK BOOK EVERY EVERY

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:49.966 region:rollup2
MONTH TO SEE THE YEAR ACTUALLY.

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:51.734 region:rollup2
PUTTING MONEY ASIDE PAY YOUR

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:53.703 region:rollup2
TAXES TO DO IT AT THE END OF THE

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:56.973 region:rollup2
YEAR AND FRANKLY SOMETIMES

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:59.408 region:rollup2
THEY'LL GO BACK TO HOT IT.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:01.344 region:rollup2
AND SO WE USED THAT AS A TOOL TO

01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:03.145 region:rollup2
GENERALLY SEND THE MESSAGE WE

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:04.981 region:rollup2
MAY BE CHECKING DON'T MESS

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:06.449 region:rollup2
AROUND AND WILL WE CATCH HIM

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:08.150 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM.

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:10.119 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:12.688 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND PLACES ANIE OTHER

01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:13.856 region:rollup2
AUDITOR THEN WE REALLY START TO

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:15.258 region:rollup2
TRIED TO DIAL DOWN THAT'S THE

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:18.060 region:rollup2
CORE THING DO YOU HAVE THE

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:20.029 region:rollup2
TRACKING SYSTEMS. TO SHOW US THE

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.130 region:rollup2
U. INTERNALLY KNOW THAT YOU'RE

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:23.132 region:rollup2
DOING THE THINGS.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:25.201 region:rollup2
CAN WE SEE THAT THOSE TRACKING

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:27.103 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THOSE THOSE THOSE

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:28.404 region:rollup2
CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:31.040 region:rollup2
CAN WE ACTUALLY THEN GO AND DO

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:33.109 region:rollup2
SPOT CHECKS BECAUSE THAT'S A

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.677 region:rollup2
MORE EFFICIENT WAY GENERALLY.

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:36.512 region:rollup2
NOW THE QUESTION IS.

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:38.481 region:rollup2
DO WE GO FURTHER THAN THAT AND

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:39.982 region:rollup2
START TO USE PEOPLE TO GO OUT

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:41.817 region:rollup2
AND WALK THE LINE AS WE DO IN

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.785 region:rollup2
THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY WE WALK

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:44.720 region:rollup2
EVERY FOOT OF TRACK TO IT EVERY

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:46.422 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.290 region:rollup2
OR DO WE CADETS A VERY

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:49.258 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL WAY OR TO USE

01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:51.460 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY WE COULD BE USING

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:53.229 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN THE RAIL INDUSTRY

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.764 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT FASTER AND PROBABLY

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:56.432 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:59.035 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S NOT.

01:13:56.432 --> 01:14:00.202 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WHAT WE DO?

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:02.305 region:rollup2
THAT WE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:04.874 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GUIDELINES.

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:06.309 region:rollup2
HERE ARE QUESTION IS SHOULD ARE

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:09.211 region:rollup2
WE GONNA START TO DEVELOP THE

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:11.647 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY CAPACITY. TO DO THIS

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:12.181 region:rollup2
THROUGH BIG DATA THROUGH --

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:14.183 region:rollup2
THROUGH --

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:16.786 region:rollup2
DRONES IN LIGHT ARE TO BE ABLE

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:20.556 region:rollup2
TO GO MONITOR AND TO HAVE THAT

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:21.190 region:rollup2
MORE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE IS THERE.

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:24.293 region:rollup2
I HEAR YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:26.962 region:rollup2
I NOT TO GET.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:28.631 region:rollup2
COMPLETED AND JUST PAY A FINE

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:30.700 region:rollup2
AND THE ROOM AND THE INVESTOR

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:32.068 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THE HARVEST OF THAT.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.703 region:rollup2
I I I DON'T SEE THERE'S NO

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:36.205 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY COME

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:38.541 region:rollup2
FROM AN AGENCY THAT DID NOT --

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:40.609 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY MONITOR YOU KNOW ALL

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:42.745 region:rollup2
THOSE THE GAS PIPELINE INCIDENT

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:44.880 region:rollup2
AND P. GENIES --

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:46.115 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND WE WENT BACK AND

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.250 region:rollup2
SPENT A LOT OF TIME AUDITING

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:50.519 region:rollup2
SOME PLACES WE FOUND THAT THEY

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.087 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE THE CONTROLS IN

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.288 region:rollup2
PLACE AND WE DON'T CATCH IT

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:53.589 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:55.491 region:rollup2
ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:57.626 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING REALLY HARD. TO MAKE

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.494 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT NEVER HAPPENS

01:14:57.626 --> 01:15:00.529 region:rollup2
AGAIN BUT WHICH COULD TAKE ITS

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.130 region:rollup2
TIME FOR ME TO ACTUALLY SIT HERE

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.398 region:rollup2
AND TELL YOU THAT I THINK WERE

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.466 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:05.167 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:06.602 region:rollup2
MISLEAD YOU ADELINE I OVERSTATE

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.603 region:rollup2
THE CASE BUT I THINK WE GOT A

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:09.905 region:rollup2
LOT MORE WORK TO DO [inaudible]

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:13.309 region:rollup2
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:14.877 region:rollup2
MAYES.

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:16.712 region:rollup2
THANK YOU OFFER FOR BEING HERE

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:18.114 region:rollup2
AND THAT TAKING SOME THEM SOME

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:20.649 region:rollup2
THAT IT COULD QUESTIONS ROUND

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:21.283 region:rollup2
AND ENJOYING A LISTEN TO SOME OF

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.852 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSE. TO THEM WE'VE HAD

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:24.220 region:rollup2
--

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.988 region:rollup2
MANY ARE CONVERSATIONS SOME OVER

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.423 region:rollup2
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WE'VE

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:28.391 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING ON A HANDFUL OF US

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:30.292 region:rollup2
THEM WORKING ON THIS.

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.460 region:rollup2
AS SINCE JANUARY --

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:33.229 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'RE RIGHT THE IT HAS

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:35.598 region:rollup2
GONE FROM THE DEALING WITH

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:36.699 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION --

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:38.234 region:rollup2
TO THAT NOW --

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:39.468 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THAT WE'VE

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:41.303 region:rollup2
GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BE

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:42.938 region:rollup2
ABLE TO REDUCE OF THE IMPACT OF

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:45.341 region:rollup2
OF WILDFIRES ACROSS ACROSS THE

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:47.843 region:rollup2
STATE. TO WANT TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:48.978 region:rollup2
IF I CAN ABOUT THE IN WITH

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:49.779 region:rollup2
INSURANCE I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:51.714 region:rollup2
THERE IS A QUESTION THAT HAVE

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:52.715 region:rollup2
BEEN POSED --

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.550 region:rollup2
TO YOU --

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:56.986 region:rollup2
THE BUT IN REGARDS TO YOUR ROLE

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:59.088 region:rollup2
THE PC'S ROLE MARIE IT IT AND

01:15:56.986 --> 01:16:00.289 region:rollup2
INTENT ESTABLISHING WHAT TYPE OF

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:02.391 region:rollup2
OF LIABILITY.

01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:04.427 region:rollup2
INSURANCE AT THAT DE I USE

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:06.529 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE A MAN IN REGARDS TO

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:09.799 region:rollup2
ALSO A RECOVERING OF THOSE COSTS

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:12.635 region:rollup2
AS WELL. TWO WE DON'T GENERALLY

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:13.736 region:rollup2
REQUIRE LEVELS OF INSURANCE

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:15.938 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:17.673 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES THE UTILITY HAVE TO

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:19.375 region:rollup2
ENSURE AND IT'S A GOOD IT'S

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.875 region:rollup2
ALWAYS A CHALLENGE TO KNOW

01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:21.043 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:23.412 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:25.581 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING IN

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:27.716 region:rollup2
AND IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:29.819 region:rollup2
TERMS OF FIRE IS HE CAN'T GET

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:31.620 region:rollup2
INSURANCE?

01:16:29.819 --> 01:16:33.322 region:rollup2
SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:35.791 region:rollup2
LEVEL WE SAT [inaudible]

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:39.195 region:rollup2
THE CAMPFIRE.

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:41.230 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S PARTIALLY A HAY

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:43.165 region:rollup2
QUE OUTCOME OF THE INSURANCE

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:44.700 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY STARTING TO LOOK AT

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:46.802 region:rollup2
THEIR RISK IN THE FACE OF

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.237 region:rollup2
ADVANCING CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.705 region:rollup2
AND THEY LOOK AT TEN YEARS OF

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:50.239 region:rollup2
DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.841 region:rollup2
BEEN BACKING OFF ON THEIR

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:53.876 region:rollup2
COVERAGE.

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:55.611 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:56.846 region:rollup2
ITS A TACIT ADMISSION.

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.380 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROBABLY HAVE TO START

01:16:56.846 --> 01:17:01.050 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO DIFFERENT MODELS

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:02.718 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ALSO TRUE.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:04.653 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE SAME INSURANCE

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:06.255 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HAVE BEEN LOOKIN AT

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:07.590 region:rollup2
AND OTHER AND AND SOME OF THE

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:09.825 region:rollup2
THE RETAIL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:10.059 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE FIRE MAPS AND

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.093 region:rollup2
SAYING.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:14.897 region:rollup2
WELL HOLY COW.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:15.698 region:rollup2
ARE WE GONNA START TO TO AREAS

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:17.500 region:rollup2
THAT WE NOW KNOW OUR EXTREMELY

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:18.868 region:rollup2
HAZARDOUS.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.237 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD WE JUST GET OUT OF

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:22.571 region:rollup2
THE BUSINESS IS SIMILAR TO THE

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:23.038 region:rollup2
TO THE POSITION THAT THEY TOOK

01:17:22.571 --> 01:17:24.974 region:rollup2
AFTER THE LOMA PRIETA

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:26.709 region:rollup2
EARTHQUAKE.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:28.144 region:rollup2
WHEN MANY OF THE RETAIL

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:30.079 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO SERVED

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:31.981 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS IN COMMERCIAL AND

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:33.716 region:rollup2
EVEN INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS?

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:34.884 region:rollup2
JUST DECIDED THEY WERE NOT GOING

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:36.218 region:rollup2
TO WRITE MORE POLICIES THAT

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:38.254 region:rollup2
COVER EARTHQUAKE RISK HEARING

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:40.990 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:42.625 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THAT HARM IF WE

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.526 region:rollup2
DID SET STANDARDS IT DOESN'T

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:45.027 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT THEY CAN GET IT.

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:46.695 region:rollup2
OR IF THEY DO GET IT IS GOING TO

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:48.364 region:rollup2
BE SO EXPENSIVE THAT WE MIGHT

01:17:46.695 --> 01:17:51.700 region:rollup2
JUST SAY THAT WERE YOU PROBABLY

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:54.637 region:rollup2
BETTER OFF SELF INSURING.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.704 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE EVERY BUSINESS HAS

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:57.540 region:rollup2
GENERAL LIABILITYINSURANCE

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:58.574 region:rollup2
EVERY BUSINESS DOES.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:01.210 region:rollup2
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:17:58.574 --> 01:18:03.512 region:rollup2
I'LL USE AND THE APPEAL USES

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:05.114 region:rollup2
THAT THE PTO USE WHICH YOU GUYS

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.749 region:rollup2
DOWN FOUND THE DON'T REGULATE%

01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.983 region:rollup2
RELEASED THEM TO VERY LITTLE

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:09.785 region:rollup2
EXTENT IF YOU DO.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:11.020 region:rollup2
THE P. YOU USE ARE ABLE TO US TO

01:18:09.785 --> 01:18:13.622 region:rollup2
TO JUST RATES TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.859 region:rollup2
FACTOR FOR THAT THAT LIABILITY.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:18.527 region:rollup2
THE I'LL USE ARE NOT ABLE. TO DO

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:21.096 region:rollup2
THAT SO IF THEY CAN'T GET

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:22.565 region:rollup2
LIABILITY INSURANCE. TO BE ABLE

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:24.833 region:rollup2
TO RUN THEIR BUSINESS AND TO

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:25.501 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY BOMB TO

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.603 region:rollup2
THEIR CREDITORS.

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:29.038 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.973 region:rollup2
AT WE GELLED OUT WITH ON THE

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.607 region:rollup2
STATE CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:32.508 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE

01:18:31.607 --> 01:18:34.510 region:rollup2
FIRST PAYER.

01:18:32.508 --> 01:18:36.512 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT THE RIGHT TO CHECK FOR

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:39.415 region:rollup2
A 100% OF THE OF THE COST WHEN

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:41.283 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT ONLY BE 1% OR 5%.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:43.118 region:rollup2
I'M LIABLE THAT THE SEAT DOESN'T

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.687 region:rollup2
SEEM TO GEL TO ME WELL I

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.855 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T ARGUE THAT IT DOES IT

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:48.557 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM TO GEL TO THE TO

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:51.226 region:rollup2
THE CAPITAL MARKETS.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:53.362 region:rollup2
THESE UTILITIES DON'T RUN.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:54.830 region:rollup2
ON THEIR CASH RECEIPTS THEY

01:18:53.362 --> 01:18:56.799 region:rollup2
BORROW A LOT FOR NEW

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.734 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOMETIMES FOR

01:18:56.799 --> 01:19:01.503 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.638 region:rollup2
COLLECTING IN SMALL AMOUNTS SO

01:19:01.503 --> 01:19:04.506 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAVE TO PUT IN NEW

01:19:02.638 --> 01:19:04.873 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE TO PUT

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:07.409 region:rollup2
IN NEW.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:09.244 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:10.980 region:rollup2
CAPITAL MARKETS EITHER BONDS OR

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:12.381 region:rollup2
THROUGH SELLING SHARES TO BE

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:13.682 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GET THE CASH THEY NEED

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:16.051 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:18.454 region:rollup2
F. THOSE CAPITAL MARKETS START

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:19.855 region:rollup2
TO SEE THAT AS THE FIRST PAY

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:21.156 region:rollup2
YOUR WHICH IS WHAT THE COURTS

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:23.993 region:rollup2
DECIDED THAT --

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:26.962 region:rollup2
UTILITY SHOULD BE YOU HAVE.

01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:28.163 region:rollup2
ANY ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEN

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.498 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:33.002 region:rollup2
TO PAY IT'S NOT.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:36.171 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A A A JUDGMENT OF

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:38.007 region:rollup2
NEGLECT IT WAS THE COURTS WAY OF

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:39.675 region:rollup2
AVOIDING HAVING.

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:40.609 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH ALL THOSE CLAIMS

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:42.544 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS INVERSE

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:43.746 region:rollup2
CONDEMNATIONS CALIFORNIA WHO HER

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:46.348 region:rollup2
LAST TIME.

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:47.816 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN ALABAMA ARE THE

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:49.284 region:rollup2
ONLY TWO STATES TO USE THAT.

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:50.452 region:rollup2
SO THE CAPITAL MARKETS ARE

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:52.087 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS THEY'RE SAYING

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:53.989 region:rollup2
WELL THESE GUYS MAY HAVE TO PAY

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:56.625 region:rollup2
A LOT OF CLAIMS.

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:59.294 region:rollup2
AND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO THEN.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:20:01.897 region:rollup2
PULL BACK CASH FROM OTHER THINGS

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:03.232 region:rollup2
INCLUDING PAYING SHARES THE YOU

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:04.366 region:rollup2
KNOW GOD HELP US IF THEY MISTER

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.868 region:rollup2
BOND PAYMENT.

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:08.937 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEN THERE WOULD BE.

01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:12.041 region:rollup2
A UNWILLINGNESS TO INVEST.

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:13.942 region:rollup2
ANNIE AND CALIFORNIA UTILITIES

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:15.110 region:rollup2
THEY MAY ACTUALLY GO SO FAR AS

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:17.212 region:rollup2
TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:18.047 region:rollup2
BUSINESS CLIMATE IS IS IN

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:20.149 region:rollup2
DISARRAY.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:21.717 region:rollup2
AND DECIDE NOT TO INVEST

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.951 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE I'D THAT'S THE KINDS

01:20:21.717 --> 01:20:25.888 region:rollup2
OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN

01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:29.158 region:rollup2
MARKETS GET NERVOUS --

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:30.259 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ADD TO THAT AGAIN THE

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.894 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THE INSURANCE

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:32.928 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE DEPARTING FROM

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:35.030 region:rollup2
THIS MARKET?

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:36.432 region:rollup2
AND HALL THAT FALLS ON THE

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.833 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:40.703 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:43.005 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF OF

01:20:40.703 --> 01:20:45.140 region:rollup2
INVESTORS REALLY DO THIS

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:46.575 region:rollup2
DISCONCERTED ABOUT WHAT'S TAKING

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.277 region:rollup2
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:50.746 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T TALK TO THOSE

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:52.548 region:rollup2
INVESTORS WITH THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:50.746 --> 01:20:54.516 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IS PART OF

01:20:52.548 --> 01:20:56.185 region:rollup2
THE REFORMS FOR THE P. YOU SEE.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:58.887 region:rollup2
CLAIRE THAT THOSE INVESTORS ARE

01:20:56.185 --> 01:21:00.923 region:rollup2
NOW ON PARTY'S.

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:02.658 region:rollup2
IN OUR PROCEEDINGS SO TO TALK TO

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:04.360 region:rollup2
THEM THEN TRIGGERS ALL OF THE EX

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:05.661 region:rollup2
PARTE COMMUNICATIONS.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.396 region:rollup2
SO I JUST MADE THE PERSONAL

01:21:05.661 --> 01:21:09.231 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT THAT I WOULDN'T TALK

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:10.365 region:rollup2
TO THEM SO I DON'T HAVE REAL

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:11.867 region:rollup2
CONFIRMATION OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:21:10.365 --> 01:21:13.435 region:rollup2
THINKING I CAN ONLY LOOK AT

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:15.270 region:rollup2
THEIR PUBLISHED REPORTS.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:16.939 region:rollup2
OF HOW THEY LOOK AT THE CREDIT

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.974 region:rollup2
OF THESE UTILITIES.

01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:20.943 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US TO

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:22.978 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE IF IT

01:21:20.943 --> 01:21:24.012 region:rollup2
AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:26.014 region:rollup2
CAPITAL AND THEY HAVE TO HEAR

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:27.583 region:rollup2
GOING TO HIT A A CASH SHORTFALL

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:30.119 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:31.553 region:rollup2
THEY MAY COME TO US AND SAY OKAY

01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:33.489 region:rollup2
YOU'VE GIVEN US DIRECTION TO

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:35.391 region:rollup2
SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY ON

01:21:33.489 --> 01:21:37.893 region:rollup2
ELECTRIFICATION A TRANSPORTATION

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:39.561 region:rollup2
THIS MUCH MONEY ON BIOMASS

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:41.296 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THIS MUCH MONEY.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:43.966 region:rollup2
ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:45.467 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE CASH AVAILABLE.

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:47.302 region:rollup2
TO DO ALL OF THAT WHAT'S THE

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:48.971 region:rollup2
PRIORITY.

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:50.405 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:52.408 region:rollup2
THAT WE WILL FACE.

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:53.876 region:rollup2
I TEND TO NOT THINK THAT THERE

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:55.277 region:rollup2
WILL BE BANKRUPTCIES AND

01:21:53.876 --> 01:21:57.312 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOT SOON.

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:58.480 region:rollup2
BUT I DO SEE IMPAIRMENT TO

01:21:57.312 --> 01:22:00.449 region:rollup2
CREDIT RATING AND I'VE BEEN A

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.651 region:rollup2
BILL YOU DO CAPITAL FORMATION

01:22:00.449 --> 01:22:04.753 region:rollup2
AND POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:06.021 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.389 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE COMMITMENTS THEY MET

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:08.724 region:rollup2
THEY MADE.

01:22:07.389 --> 01:22:10.159 region:rollup2
YOU MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT

01:22:08.724 --> 01:22:12.561 region:rollup2
PERSON TO ASK THIS QUESTION OF

01:22:10.159 --> 01:22:14.096 region:rollup2
BUT I'M.

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:15.497 region:rollup2
HE DID I USED TO THEIR CREDIT

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.732 region:rollup2
RATINGS HAVE HAVE DROPPED WHICH

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:18.767 region:rollup2
IS CREATED THIS BIT OF UP A BIT

01:22:16.732 --> 01:22:19.668 region:rollup2
OF A CRISIS BECAUSE MANYOF THEM

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:22.404 region:rollup2
WERE JUST ABOVE.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:24.807 region:rollup2
A JUNK BOND STATUS IS THAT AS

01:22:22.404 --> 01:22:26.508 region:rollup2
MUCH REVIEW IF I COULD I YOUR

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:28.377 region:rollup2
LINE OF QUESTIONING IS SUSAN

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:30.279 region:rollup2
WHOSE SOUND VERY MUCH IMPORTANT

01:22:28.377 --> 01:22:30.946 region:rollup2
AND IT GOES TO A LOT OF THE

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:31.947 region:rollup2
HEART OF WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DEAL

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.215 region:rollup2
WITH --

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.784 region:rollup2
HOWEVER IN THIS PARTICULAR

01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:36.785 region:rollup2
AGENDA WE'RE GONNA TRY AND I

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.187 region:rollup2
KINDA LET GO A LITTLE BIT SO

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.488 region:rollup2
THAT THERE COULD BE AN ANSWER TO

01:22:38.187 --> 01:22:40.489 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION TO THE EXTENT

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:42.024 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE

01:22:40.489 --> 01:22:43.392 region:rollup2
AND I'M MISTER CHAIR JUST A

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:44.293 region:rollup2
MINUTE COULD BE BILLY BUT A YES

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:47.262 region:rollup2
OR NO ANSWER.

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:50.432 region:rollup2
I'M JUST IN REGARDS TO WHETHER

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:52.467 region:rollup2
THE P. SAME IN THE SAME WAY THAT

01:22:50.432 --> 01:22:53.702 region:rollup2
THE VALUES HAVE.

BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING TO SAVE

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:10.285 region:rollup2

CONDUCTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO AS

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:08.043 region:rollup2
HE LAUNCHED A COMPREHENSIVE POLL

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:08.710 region:rollup2
REPLACING PROGRAM TWENTY

FIRST ON POLES LOCATED IN AREAS.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:15.217 region:rollup2
THE POSE BOTH HIGH WIND AND HIGH

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:16.918 region:rollup2
FIRE RISKS AND ASSESSING THESE

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:19.588 region:rollup2
FALLS AGAINST THE UPDATED WIPED

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:21.089 region:rollup2
OUT WHEN STANDARDS.

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:22.858 region:rollup2
SOLUTION OUR EXTENSIVE EXISTING

FORECASTING CAPABILITIES.

01:29:35.003 --> 01:29:37.539 region:rollup2
SO NOW I TALKED A LITTLE BIT

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:39.140 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE'VE HISTORICALLY

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:41.076 region:rollup2

KNOW THE HARDING OUR SYSTEM'S

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:49.584 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE CORE

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:59.094 region:rollup2
I IT SEES HARDING THE DESIGN OF

01:29:57.659 --> 01:30:00.829 region:rollup2
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN OTHER WAYS

01:29:59.094 --> 01:30:02.297 region:rollup2
ON THESE A SIGNIFICANT AYE WE'RE

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:03.465 region:rollup2
INCREASING USE OF FIRE RESISTANT

01:30:02.297 --> 01:30:05.600 region:rollup2
POLLS.

01:30:03.465 --> 01:30:06.901 region:rollup2
A COMPOSITE CROSS ARMS COVER

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.602 region:rollup2
CONDUCTOR WHICH WILL BE A A

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:09.237 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT --

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:10.772 region:rollup2
INVEST IN ACROSS OUR SYSTEM.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:12.374 region:rollup2
AND CURRENT LIMITING FUSES AND

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:13.408 region:rollup2
SELECT AYE FAR RISK AREAS TO

01:30:12.374 --> 01:30:14.843 region:rollup2
ENHANCE RESILIENCY OF OUR

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:16.611 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND REDUCE THE

01:30:14.843 --> 01:30:18.847 region:rollup2
RISK OF IGNITIONS.

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:21.683 region:rollup2
THAT'S YOUR RAP UP POLICE OF

01:30:18.847 --> 01:30:23.218 region:rollup2
OKAY TOM MIA GOT TODAY AND GOT A

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:25.754 region:rollup2
GREAT DECK I GOT THROUGH IT

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:27.289 region:rollup2
ALREADY SUBJECT SURE I I WOULD

01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:28.490 region:rollup2
LIKE TO USE A COUPLE THINGS I

01:30:27.289 --> 01:30:30.125 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:31.126 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY SCE'S EMPHASIZE

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:32.394 region:rollup2
MITIGATION WILDFIRE RISK UP BUT

01:30:31.126 --> 01:30:33.228 region:rollup2
THE YEAR ROUND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:30:32.394 --> 01:30:34.930 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES IN THE NEW NORMAL

01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:36.564 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT UNDERSCORE THE NEED

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:37.732 region:rollup2
TO DO MORE --

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:38.934 region:rollup2
WAS TAKING PRACTICE STEPS TO

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.868 region:rollup2
BOLSTER WHILE FIRE MITIGATION

01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:41.236 region:rollup2
PLANNING.

01:30:39.868 --> 01:30:42.170 region:rollup2
AND BASED ON GOVERNOR BROWN'S

01:30:41.236 --> 01:30:44.072 region:rollup2
RECENT PROPOSAL A GREAT HARDING

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:44.673 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENTS.

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:45.774 region:rollup2
ABOUT WE BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE

01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:47.242 region:rollup2
RIGHT TRACK.

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:49.311 region:rollup2
AT THE STATE UTILITIES NEED TO

01:30:47.242 --> 01:30:50.145 region:rollup2
REEVALUATE EXISTING POLICIES I

01:30:49.311 --> 01:30:51.813 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S BEEN A THEME IT'S

01:30:50.145 --> 01:30:53.315 region:rollup2
REALLY WAS DURING A GERMAN

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:54.916 region:rollup2
PICKERS DISCUSSION EARLIER --

01:30:53.315 --> 01:30:56.318 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS AND

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.953 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

01:30:56.318 --> 01:30:58.453 region:rollup2
A TWO HOUR FIRE MITIGATION

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:00.455 region:rollup2
ENCOMPASSES OPERATIONAL

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:02.290 region:rollup2
PRACTICES WHETHER MONITORING AND

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:03.858 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HARDENING.

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:04.926 region:rollup2
BUT THIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:06.494 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT THE GRANT

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:08.530 region:rollup2
I THINK HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:09.998 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ALREADY AS WELL.

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:11.266 region:rollup2
S. E. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

01:31:09.998 --> 01:31:12.901 region:rollup2

FEW AND I JUST WANNA HAVE SOME

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:53.007 region:rollup2
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT

INDICES ARE DRIVING OUR

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:38.172 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL BEHAVIORS --

FIRST THE WORK THEY WERE DOING

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:48.116 region:rollup2
IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT --

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:49.918 region:rollup2
A PRESIDENT PICKER HAD TALKED

01:34:48.116 --> 01:34:51.186 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE

CLARENCE STNDARDS.

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:55.456 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S NOT

01:34:53.755 --> 01:34:56.958 region:rollup2
ENOUGH AND US WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:59.160 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM TO GO BEYOND.

01:34:56.958 --> 01:35:01.930 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS FOCUSING ON A

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:03.598 region:rollup2
REVIEW REMOVING TREES AND FUEL

01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:05.066 region:rollup2
FROM AROUND ARE POWER LINES. TO

01:35:03.598 --> 01:35:07.335 region:rollup2
CREATE ESSENTIALLY A FIRE

01:35:05.066 --> 01:35:09.604 region:rollup2
DEFENSE ZONE --

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:10.972 region:rollup2
THAT -- IS.

01:35:09.604 --> 01:35:12.840 region:rollup2
REALLY PREVENTS THE THAT

01:35:10.972 --> 01:35:14.142 region:rollup2
IGNITION OF FIRE BUT ALSO

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.877 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY PRETTY HOOKER EAT A

DEFENSE TO BEGIN.

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:21.015 region:rollup2
THE THE AND THE SECONDARY WANTED

01:35:19.681 --> 01:35:23.351 region:rollup2

01:35:21.015 --> 01:35:25.687 region:rollup2
ENHANCED OF NEW MEASURES IS THT

01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:27.255 region:rollup2
WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A PLAN. TO

01:35:25.687 --> 01:35:28.456 region:rollup2
PROACTIVELY DE ENERGIZED POWER

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:29.958 region:rollup2
LINES IN THE MOST EXTREME

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:32.060 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS.

01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:33.528 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.896 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO P. JEANINE I I

01:35:33.528 --> 01:35:37.599 region:rollup2
WANNA REALLY EVER EMPHASIZED

VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ADVERSE

01:35:40.034 --> 01:35:43.838 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF DE ENERGIZING POWER

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:46.174 region:rollup2
LINES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.

01:35:43.838 --> 01:35:48.643 region:rollup2
OF THAT IN OF ITSELF CREATES AYE

01:35:46.174 --> 01:35:51.279 region:rollup2
IT'S ONLY SET ITS OWN SET OF A

01:35:48.643 --> 01:35:53.014 region:rollup2
OF SAFETY HAZARDS.

01:35:51.279 --> 01:35:54.582 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE WORKING VERY

01:35:53.014 --> 01:35:55.483 region:rollup2
CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES TO

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:57.285 region:rollup2

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:02.290 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION

01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:03.558 region:rollup2

HOW THAT WILL ALLOW US TO

01:36:43.765 --> 01:36:47.535 region:rollup2
QUICKLY INSTALL ENERGY RESOURCES

AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE P.

01:38:31.973 --> 01:38:35.009 region:rollup2
TO SEE A REGULAR SHOULD REVIEW

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:36.577 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM --

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:37.912 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE SHOULD BE DEEMED

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:39.480 region:rollup2
REASONABLE IF WE MEET THAT

01:38:37.912 --> 01:38:40.948 region:rollup2

HAVE OVER HER WEATHER STATIONS

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:16.150 region:rollup2
OVER HUNDRED CAMERAS IT REALLY

01:39:14.482 --> 01:39:17.318 region:rollup2
DOES.

01:39:16.150 --> 01:39:19.420 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ALLOWS THIS A WEEK

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:21.255 region:rollup2
BEFORE AN EVENT TO REALLY FIGURE

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:23.558 region:rollup2
OUT WHERE WE ARE FROM A FROM A

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:25.359 region:rollup2
FIRE AND WHETHER PERSPECTIVE.

01:39:23.558 --> 01:39:27.795 region:rollup2
SO THE SAME INSTRUMENTS INTAKE

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:29.163 region:rollup2
YOU ALLOW ME A REAL TIME TO MAKE

01:39:27.795 --> 01:39:31.132 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL DECISIONS.

01:39:29.163 --> 01:39:31.999 region:rollup2
WE DID NOT HAVE THOSE TOOLS

01:39:31.132 --> 01:39:33.901 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE --

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:36.204 region:rollup2
BICU TEN YEARS AGO SO.

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:37.538 region:rollup2
A BEEN OUR CAMERAS WE WORK VERY

01:39:36.204 --> 01:39:38.840 region:rollup2
CLOSE WITH CAL FIRE.

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:41.075 region:rollup2
WHENEVER THERE'S IGNITION THIS

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:44.212 region:rollup2
HAPPENED BACK THE LILAC FIRE IN

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:46.080 region:rollup2
DECEMBER AND ALSO ON JULY SIX WE

01:39:44.212 --> 01:39:47.548 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SAW THOSE FIRES IN

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.449 region:rollup2
THERE AS BIG AS THIS TABLE.

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:51.052 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE WATCHED THAT WE

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:52.253 region:rollup2
WATCHES SUPPRESSION THE TOOLS

01:39:51.052 --> 01:39:53.988 region:rollup2
ARE JUST INVALUABLE.

01:39:52.253 --> 01:39:56.724 region:rollup2
FOUGHT SO REALLY WHAT IT DOES IT

01:39:53.988 --> 01:39:57.725 region:rollup2
GIVES IS MICROCLIMATE FORECAST

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:59.961 region:rollup2
FOR EACH ONE OF OUR CIRCUITS IN

01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:01.229 region:rollup2
BACK COUNTRY SO THIS INFORMATION

01:39:59.961 --> 01:40:03.130 region:rollup2
IS TRULY CRITICAL.

01:40:01.229 --> 01:40:04.498 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE MINIMIZATION OF OF

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:06.434 region:rollup2
FIRES A TALK WITH OF OUR GOODS

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:08.469 region:rollup2
MANAGER PROGRAMS --

01:40:06.434 --> 01:40:10.137 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR AND SIXTY

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:11.806 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND TREES LE IN OUR IN

01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:14.242 region:rollup2
OUR SERVICE TERRITORY.

01:40:11.806 --> 01:40:16.077 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST A PART OF

01:40:14.242 --> 01:40:18.946 region:rollup2
OUR SUCCESS IS WE HAVE EACH ONE

01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:19.981 region:rollup2
OF THOSE TREES IN OUR GIS DATA

01:40:18.946 --> 01:40:21.649 region:rollup2
BASE AND HAD A DATABASE.

01:40:19.981 --> 01:40:23.618 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE SPECIES A TREE WE

01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:24.585 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW FAST IT'S GROWING WE

01:40:23.618 --> 01:40:26.988 region:rollup2
KNOW IN LAST SUMMER'S TRIMMED

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:27.521 region:rollup2
THE LATCH SUMS INSPECTED THAT

01:40:26.988 --> 01:40:28.389 region:rollup2
REALLY IS THE BASIS OF OUR

01:40:27.521 --> 01:40:31.926 region:rollup2
PROGRAM [inaudible]

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:34.395 region:rollup2
WE ALSO THEN TAKE I HAVE A VERY

01:40:31.926 --> 01:40:35.663 region:rollup2
VERY DETAILED PROCESS THAT WE GO

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:38.533 region:rollup2
OUT AND DO ALL THE PRE

01:40:35.663 --> 01:40:39.166 region:rollup2
INSPECTION OF THOSE TREES ALL

01:40:38.533 --> 01:40:40.167 region:rollup2
FOR SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND AND ON

01:40:39.166 --> 01:40:42.103 region:rollup2
AVERAGE WE END OF TRIMMING ABOUT

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:43.004 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:40:42.103 --> 01:40:43.204 region:rollup2
OF THEM BUT WE LOOK AT ALL THE

01:40:43.004 --> 01:40:44.872 region:rollup2
THEN.

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:46.374 region:rollup2
WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT AUDITS

01:40:44.872 --> 01:40:48.743 region:rollup2
WE OUGHT DEBT FREE INSPECTION

01:40:46.374 --> 01:40:50.378 region:rollup2
PROCESS --

01:40:48.743 --> 01:40:52.046 region:rollup2
THEN WE GO BACK AND EXIT WE WE

01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:52.747 region:rollup2
DROVE A HARD SEVENTY FIVE

01:40:52.046 --> 01:40:54.448 region:rollup2
THOUSAND REMOVED BY A THOUSAND

01:40:52.747 --> 01:40:55.583 region:rollup2
TREES HERE.

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:57.084 region:rollup2
WE'RE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE AND WE

01:40:55.583 --> 01:40:59.387 region:rollup2
MATED THE MORE AGGRESSIVEBUT WE

01:40:57.084 --> 01:41:00.421 region:rollup2
TRY TO TEMPT TRIM BACK TEN TO

01:40:59.387 --> 01:41:02.189 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN FEET.

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:03.724 region:rollup2
BAR SO THAT ALL THOSE TREES WILL

01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:04.625 region:rollup2
MAKE IT TO RECYCLE.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:06.060 region:rollup2
BOB THEM ONTO THE TREE TRIMMING

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:06.561 region:rollup2
WILL BACK INTO AN ART OF THE

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:07.762 region:rollup2
ACTUAL THE TREE TRIMMERS

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:08.996 region:rollup2
HIMSELF.

01:41:07.762 --> 01:41:11.065 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THAT'S ENSURE THEIR

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:13.834 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS TO DO A GOOD JOB AND

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:16.437 region:rollup2
pSEASON GO BACK IN THE HIGHEST

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:17.371 region:rollup2
FIRE THREAT AREAS AND DO ANOTHER

01:41:16.437 --> 01:41:20.174 region:rollup2
PATROL SO.

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:21.442 region:rollup2
YOU REALLY NEVER BE KNOWS --

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:23.010 region:rollup2
TO HE HAVE TO REALLY WORK VERY

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:24.245 region:rollup2
HARD TO TREAT FOR ME WERE ALSO

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:25.880 region:rollup2
USING SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY NEW

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:26.480 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES MENTIONED EARLY

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.815 region:rollup2
LIGHT ARE.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.317 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS IT SHOULD DETERMINE

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:31.652 region:rollup2
HOW FAR TREES ARE WAVE MORE

01:41:29.317 --> 01:41:35.957 region:rollup2
FACILITIES WERE ALSO USE NET FOR

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:38.159 region:rollup2
QC BY OVER INFRASTRUCTURE CSUS

01:41:35.957 --> 01:41:39.293 region:rollup2
NOT SPEAK OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:41:38.159 --> 01:41:41.462 region:rollup2
BOB WEAVER PLAYS STEP.

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:42.129 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOOT

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.698 region:rollup2
POLES OF STEEL POLES WHEN WE DO

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:45.399 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT A BIGGER WIRE ALSO

01:41:43.698 --> 01:41:46.801 region:rollup2
AND WE SPREAD THE CONDUCTORS ALL

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:47.868 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY.

01:41:46.801 --> 01:41:49.570 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE NEW CONDITIONS

01:41:47.868 --> 01:41:51.806 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WE KNOW ABOUT GOING TO

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:53.374 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONDITIONS.

01:41:51.806 --> 01:41:54.842 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR IMITATION WE'VE SEEN

01:41:53.374 --> 01:41:56.310 region:rollup2
WIND SPEEDS OF A HUNDRED MILES

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:56.911 region:rollup2
AN HOUR AND CITY A GO OUT TELL

01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.713 region:rollup2
YOU NO ONE EVER KNEW THE WIND

01:41:56.911 --> 01:42:00.381 region:rollup2
BLEW THE HARD DIEGO.

01:41:58.713 --> 01:42:01.082 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY HAVE SEEN A LOT

01:42:00.381 --> 01:42:02.450 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:42:01.082 --> 01:42:04.285 region:rollup2
ARE THREE MAIN PROGRAMS AND

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:06.020 region:rollup2
HARDENING ARE OUR FIRM PROGRAMS

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:07.822 region:rollup2
ARE DISTRIBUTION POLLS THAT WERE

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:09.657 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY KNOW THAT SMALL WIRE

01:42:07.822 --> 01:42:10.758 region:rollup2
OUT THERE IS IS RECALL PUT A LOT

01:42:09.657 --> 01:42:12.693 region:rollup2
OF TIMES THE WIND STORM SEWER

01:42:10.758 --> 01:42:13.861 region:rollup2
FOLK WERE FOCUSINGON SMALL WIRE

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:16.263 region:rollup2
REPLACEMENT.

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:18.499 region:rollup2
IN AND HIGH FIRE AREAS WE HAVE A

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:20.635 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION PROGRAM.

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:22.303 region:rollup2
WE'RE CHANGING OUT --

01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:23.971 region:rollup2
SHAWL STEEL POLES THAT'S WELL ON

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:26.207 region:rollup2
ITS WAY ACTION IT WILL BE DONE

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.841 region:rollup2
BY -- TWENTY

01:42:26.207 --> 01:42:27.808 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER

01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:29.143 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OVERLOOKING A POLL

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:30.544 region:rollup2
LOADING NAME WE TALKED EARLIER

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:32.313 region:rollup2
ABOUT --

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:34.281 region:rollup2
HAVING COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS

01:42:32.313 --> 01:42:35.516 region:rollup2
ARE POLLS NOW THAT'S THAT'S A

01:42:34.281 --> 01:42:37.351 region:rollup2
BIG EFFORTS ARE USING LIDAR

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:39.253 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE ALSO TO

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:40.688 region:rollup2
SURVEY ALL THE POLLS ARE HIGHERS

01:42:39.253 --> 01:42:41.689 region:rollup2
FAR GREATER AREA.

01:42:40.688 --> 01:42:43.557 region:rollup2
RE CLOSERS --

01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:46.093 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN OFF SINCE MAY OR

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:47.728 region:rollup2
JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:48.829 region:rollup2
ARE PART PROCESS IN THE PAST HAS

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:50.965 region:rollup2
BEEN.

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:52.633 region:rollup2
THE INTERMITTENT SPRING WHERE

01:42:50.965 --> 01:42:54.635 region:rollup2
BILLY ELEVATE CONDITIONS THAT

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:56.671 region:rollup2
COME BACK ON AND IN DECEMBER

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:57.838 region:rollup2
JANUARY WE NEVER TURN THEM BACK

01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:59.473 region:rollup2
ON THIS YEAR AND THEY WON'T BE

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:01.442 region:rollup2
ON AGAIN UNTIL WE GET SOME RAIN

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:03.010 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO SO IT COULD COULD BE A

01:43:01.442 --> 01:43:04.045 region:rollup2
LONG TIME.

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.513 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN A LOT A LOT OF WORK

01:43:04.045 --> 01:43:06.814 region:rollup2
THERE AND JUST LASSEN OUT REGION

01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:07.948 region:rollup2
SUPPRESSION WE HAVE TO

01:43:06.814 --> 01:43:09.316 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE WITH ALL

01:43:07.948 --> 01:43:10.584 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO OUR CUSTOMERS

01:43:09.316 --> 01:43:11.118 region:rollup2
ISSUES IMPORTANT.

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:13.320 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY THE POWER IS DE

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:15.456 region:rollup2
ENERGIZED.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.291 region:rollup2
BOB WE WE ALSO WORKED VERY CLOSE

01:43:15.456 --> 01:43:19.026 region:rollup2
TO THE AGENCIES WE SHARE ALL HER

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:20.361 region:rollup2
INFORMATION HELLFIRE OF SOME OF

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.996 region:rollup2
OUR BIGGEST SUPPORTERS ARE CAL

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:23.464 region:rollup2
FIRE THE CITY SAN DIEGO OTHER

01:43:21.996 --> 01:43:24.765 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY

01:43:23.464 --> 01:43:26.500 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:28.202 region:rollup2
I AS FAR SUPPRESSION.

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:30.604 region:rollup2
ARE WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE THE HELL

01:43:28.202 --> 01:43:31.205 region:rollup2
ANKARD SAN DIEGO IT CAN DROP

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.506 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX HUNDRED GALLONS OF

01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:34.308 region:rollup2
WATER --

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:35.976 region:rollup2
SMALLER HELICOPTER TO SEE MOST

01:43:34.308 --> 01:43:36.744 region:rollup2
THE TIME COULD DROP THREE

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:38.379 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:43:36.744 --> 01:43:39.847 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR DISPATCHING THROUGH

01:43:38.379 --> 01:43:40.748 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE.

01:43:39.847 --> 01:43:42.183 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE GOT MORE WATER THIS

01:43:40.748 --> 01:43:42.683 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT WE HAVE ANY OTHER HERE

01:43:42.183 --> 01:43:44.852 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST [inaudible]

01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:46.253 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:43:44.852 --> 01:43:47.555 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS DOWN

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:49.290 region:rollup2
IN ALPINE AND SAW WHAT A GREAT

01:43:47.555 --> 01:43:49.857 region:rollup2
JOB THAT WAS TO GET THAT FIRE

01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:51.459 region:rollup2
OUT AS QUICKLY AS IT DID GET

01:43:49.857 --> 01:43:53.127 region:rollup2
OUT.

01:43:51.459 --> 01:43:54.195 region:rollup2
MISTER JOSEPH.

01:43:53.127 --> 01:43:55.830 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

01:43:54.195 --> 01:43:57.398 region:rollup2
MEMBERS I THINK IF THE

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:58.399 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY.

01:43:57.398 --> 01:43:59.667 region:rollup2
I REPRESENT THE COALITION

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:02.937 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES

01:43:59.667 --> 01:44:03.504 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES IBEW.

01:44:02.937 --> 01:44:04.238 region:rollup2
TWELVE FORTY FIVE WHICH IS

01:44:03.504 --> 01:44:06.006 region:rollup2
MISTER DOESN'T MENTIONED LOST

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:07.074 region:rollup2
MEMBER TO THE CAR FIRE THIS PAST

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:09.577 region:rollup2
WEEKEND AS HE WAS WORKING TO

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:11.579 region:rollup2
RESTORE SERVICE.

01:44:09.577 --> 01:44:13.247 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THE UTILITY LINES CAN BE

01:44:11.579 --> 01:44:14.081 region:rollup2
THE SOURCE OF IGNITION AND EVEN

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:15.950 region:rollup2
ONE SPARK CAN HAVE DISASTROUS

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:17.384 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:19.120 region:rollup2
WE NEED A SAFER ELECTRIC GRID TO

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:20.187 region:rollup2
PREVENT THAT SPARK.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.388 region:rollup2
WE NEED OUR ELECTRIC GRID

01:44:20.187 --> 01:44:24.558 region:rollup2
HARDENED SO IT'S LESS LIKELY TO

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:26.060 region:rollup2
CAUSE A FIRE. TO GET THAT SAFE

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:27.995 region:rollup2
DRUG SAFER ELECTRIC GRID WITH A

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.463 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY PROGRAM

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:31.599 region:rollup2
THE FOCUS ON SAFETY AND WE DON'T

01:44:29.463 --> 01:44:33.167 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT NOW.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:35.102 region:rollup2
PRESENT PICKER HAS TRIED TO MAKE

01:44:33.167 --> 01:44:35.703 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM SAFER MISS MALASHENKO

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.837 region:rollup2
HAS TRIED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM

01:44:35.703 --> 01:44:37.538 region:rollup2
SAFER.

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:38.606 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE MADE SOME

01:44:37.538 --> 01:44:41.242 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:42.476 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH.

01:44:41.242 --> 01:44:43.677 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HARDEN UTILITY SYSTEM

01:44:42.476 --> 01:44:44.245 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE A REGULATORY

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:46.313 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RIGHT NOW TO GET THAT

01:44:44.245 --> 01:44:47.815 region:rollup2
DOT.

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:50.251 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED A CLEAR PROCESS

01:44:47.815 --> 01:44:51.352 region:rollup2
HOLDING UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE.

01:44:50.251 --> 01:44:52.219 region:rollup2
TO THE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

01:44:51.352 --> 01:44:53.854 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONFERENCE COMMITTEE

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:55.856 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:56.457 region:rollup2
ARE THE AFTER THAT TO DEAL WITH

01:44:55.856 --> 01:44:58.192 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE COMMISSION

01:44:56.457 --> 01:44:59.693 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DEALING WITH.

01:44:58.192 --> 01:45:00.728 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO BEEF

01:44:59.693 --> 01:45:02.129 region:rollup2
UP THE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION

01:45:00.728 --> 01:45:03.230 region:rollup2
PLANS.

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:04.532 region:rollup2
THERE FILE THE COMMISSION IS A

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:05.800 region:rollup2
GOOD START.

01:45:04.532 --> 01:45:07.401 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:10.070 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL.

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.671 region:rollup2
DRAWS HEAVILY FROM S. B..

01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:12.740 region:rollup2
TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WE'RE MAKING

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:14.575 region:rollup2
GOOD PROGRESS ON THAT FRONT.

01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:16.410 region:rollup2
BUT WE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT

01:45:14.575 --> 01:45:19.280 region:rollup2
BETTER MITIGATION PLANTS ALONE

01:45:16.410 --> 01:45:21.382 region:rollup2
ARE NOT ENOUGH. TO DO IT WOULD

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:23.150 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO TO PREVENT WILDFIRES.

01:45:21.382 --> 01:45:24.618 region:rollup2
AND MANY CLEAR STANDARDS FOR

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:26.120 region:rollup2
WHEN THE UTILITY HAS BEEN

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:27.188 region:rollup2
PRUDENT AND WHEN IT HAS NOT TO

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:29.323 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION KNOWS WHEN TO

01:45:27.188 --> 01:45:29.957 region:rollup2
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND YOU

01:45:29.323 --> 01:45:32.092 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION

01:45:29.957 --> 01:45:33.761 region:rollup2
YEAR AFTER YEAR. TO GET THE

01:45:32.092 --> 01:45:35.663 region:rollup2
SAFER SYSTEM WE WANT AND THE

01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:37.097 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE DESERVE.

01:45:35.663 --> 01:45:39.300 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.600 region:rollup2
AT THE P. YOU SEE IN THREE WAYS

01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.602 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.338 region:rollup2
FIRST.

01:45:41.602 --> 01:45:46.073 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T LEAVE SAFETY COSTS

01:45:44.338 --> 01:45:46.373 region:rollup2
BURIED IN THE GENERAL RATE CASE

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:48.075 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:49.910 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

01:45:48.075 --> 01:45:51.612 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE WORK FORCE PLANTS IN

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:52.446 region:rollup2
ONE PLACE BUT WE HAVE THE COST

01:45:51.612 --> 01:45:54.615 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT THEM IN A DIFFERENT

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:55.816 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:45:54.615 --> 01:45:56.884 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO FOCUS PROCEEDING

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:57.985 region:rollup2
WHERE WE DECIDE WHERE THE

01:45:56.884 --> 01:46:01.589 region:rollup2
COMMISSION DECIDES HOW AND HOW

01:45:57.985 --> 01:46:03.257 region:rollup2
MUCH. TO HARDEN THE SYSTEM.

01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:05.025 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PROCESS WHERE THE

01:46:03.257 --> 01:46:06.427 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR SAFETY COST FOR

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:08.529 region:rollup2
WELFARE MITIGATION OR IN THE

01:46:06.427 --> 01:46:09.496 region:rollup2
GENERATE CASE IS NOT WORKING

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:10.531 region:rollup2
THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY OTHER

01:46:09.496 --> 01:46:12.333 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:13.400 region:rollup2
IN THE GENERAL RATE CASE.

01:46:12.333 --> 01:46:14.702 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT ELECTRIC

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.837 region:rollup2
GENERATION CUSTOMER SERVICE

01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:18.339 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS SUPPLY MANAGEMENT

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:20.407 region:rollup2
LOGISTICS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

01:46:18.339 --> 01:46:22.009 region:rollup2
FLEET SERVICES I DON'T HAVE FIVE

01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:22.610 region:rollup2
MINUTES I'M NOT GONNA GO ON WITH

01:46:22.009 --> 01:46:23.344 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE LIST BUT YOU GET THE

01:46:22.610 --> 01:46:25.679 region:rollup2
IDEA.

01:46:23.344 --> 01:46:26.680 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:28.315 region:rollup2
TOPICS IN A JOHN A RATE CASE SO

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:29.550 region:rollup2
WHICH SAFETY JUST ONE AND

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:31.619 region:rollup2
WILDFIRES JUST ONE SUBSET OF

01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:34.154 region:rollup2
THAT ONE THING.

01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:35.789 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO HAVE A GREAT CASE

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:37.057 region:rollup2
THAT FOCUSES ON SAFETY AND

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:39.226 region:rollup2
COMBINES THE SAFETY IN THE PLANS

01:46:37.057 --> 01:46:41.695 region:rollup2
IN ONE PLACE.

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:42.863 region:rollup2
THIS LEADS TO MY SECOND POINT.

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:44.732 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY PLANTS HAVE TO BE

01:46:42.863 --> 01:46:46.100 region:rollup2
TIED TO THE COSTS.

01:46:44.732 --> 01:46:47.801 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HARDEN THE SYSTEMS WE

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:49.136 region:rollup2
NEED TO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:50.437 region:rollup2
THE THREE TOYS HAVE JUST

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:52.139 region:rollup2
TESTIFIED ABOUT.

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:52.740 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD PERFECT

01:46:52.139 --> 01:46:54.174 region:rollup2
SAFETY WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED

01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:55.709 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:58.979 region:rollup2
AND SO THE COMMISSION HAS TO

01:46:55.709 --> 01:47:00.314 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE COSTS OF IMPROVING

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:01.649 region:rollup2
SAFETY WITH SOME THINGS WE WANT

01:47:00.314 --> 01:47:03.317 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:47:01.649 --> 01:47:04.218 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT MAY BE THAT THE THE

01:47:03.317 --> 01:47:05.953 region:rollup2
BEST THING TO DO IS TO DO

01:47:04.218 --> 01:47:06.921 region:rollup2
SOMETHING EIGHTY FIVE TIMES THE

01:47:05.953 --> 01:47:07.888 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SAID YOU KNOW.

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.323 region:rollup2
WE CAN ONLY AFFORD TO DO IT

01:47:07.888 --> 01:47:10.224 region:rollup2
SIXTY TIMES.

01:47:09.323 --> 01:47:12.259 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED THE COMMISSION TO

01:47:10.224 --> 01:47:13.794 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:15.696 region:rollup2
I NEED TO DO IT TOGETHER IN A

01:47:13.794 --> 01:47:17.031 region:rollup2
RAPE CASE NOT SEPARATELY YOU

01:47:15.696 --> 01:47:18.766 region:rollup2
KNOW IN A WILDFIRE PLAN

01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:19.400 region:rollup2
PRECEDING THAT SAYS ONE THING AT

01:47:18.766 --> 01:47:22.569 region:rollup2
A RATE CASE THAT SAYS SOMETHING

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:23.203 region:rollup2
ELSE.

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:24.772 region:rollup2
THIRD POINT THIRD THING WE NEED

01:47:23.203 --> 01:47:26.206 region:rollup2
TO DO.

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:29.443 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO USE THE SAFETY PLANS

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:31.812 region:rollup2
TO SET THE STANDARDS. FOR THE

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:33.347 region:rollup2
UTILITY TO MEET AND A PROCESS

01:47:31.812 --> 01:47:34.982 region:rollup2
FOR THE COMMISSION TO HOLD THE

01:47:33.347 --> 01:47:36.650 region:rollup2
UTILITY ACCOUNTABLE. TO MEETING

01:47:34.982 --> 01:47:37.618 region:rollup2
THOSE STANDARDS.

01:47:36.650 --> 01:47:39.453 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE COMMISSION HAS MADE

01:47:37.618 --> 01:47:40.921 region:rollup2
THE HARD DECISIONS.

01:47:39.453 --> 01:47:42.289 region:rollup2
THAT'S SAFETY PLAN SHOULD BE THE

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:44.258 region:rollup2
BENCHMARK ABOUT WHETHER UTILITY

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:46.093 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN RECENT ONE PRUDENT.

01:47:44.258 --> 01:47:47.795 region:rollup2
IF UTILITY FOLLOWS ITS PLAN

01:47:46.093 --> 01:47:49.430 region:rollup2
THAT'S UNBEATABLE PRUDENT IF IT

01:47:47.795 --> 01:47:50.965 region:rollup2
HASN'T FOLLOWED ITS PLAN.

01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:53.300 region:rollup2
BUDGET RESPONSIVE FOR THE

01:47:50.965 --> 01:47:53.934 region:rollup2
DAMAGES AND SHOULD BE FINE.

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:55.302 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE THE ONE

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:56.270 region:rollup2
DECIDING.

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:57.938 region:rollup2
WITH THE UTILITY ACTION WAS

01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:59.006 region:rollup2
REASONABLE PRUDENT.

01:47:57.938 --> 01:48:00.774 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T WANNA BE BACK HERE

01:47:59.006 --> 01:48:03.077 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS AGAIN EVERY YEAR.

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:04.778 region:rollup2
SO LEGISLATOR THIS COMMITTEE

01:48:03.077 --> 01:48:05.579 region:rollup2
SHOULD GIVE THE COMMISSION THAT

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:07.648 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE GIVE THE COMMISSION THE

01:48:05.579 --> 01:48:09.917 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:10.551 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT CAN DO ITS JOB AND

01:48:09.917 --> 01:48:13.187 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT OVER AND

01:48:10.551 --> 01:48:13.821 region:rollup2
OVER AGAIN.

01:48:13.187 --> 01:48:15.489 region:rollup2
SO WE WOULD TAKE THE GOVERNOR'S

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:17.324 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL FIX THE UNDERLYING

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:18.592 region:rollup2
PROCESS SO WE CAN GET ON WITH

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:20.394 region:rollup2
HARDENING UTILITY SYSTEM AS

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:22.429 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:48:20.394 --> 01:48:23.697 region:rollup2
AND SETTING THE STANDARDS OF THE

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:25.532 region:rollup2
COMMISSION COULD APPLY TO HOLD

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:26.100 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE SO WE

01:48:25.532 --> 01:48:26.667 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK HERE

01:48:26.100 --> 01:48:28.035 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND AGAIN [inaudible]

01:48:26.667 --> 01:48:30.037 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:48:28.035 --> 01:48:31.472 region:rollup2
IF YOU MISSED JOSEPH.

01:48:30.037 --> 01:48:33.340 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR

01:48:31.472 --> 01:48:33.874 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY WOULD BE TAKE

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:36.777 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS NOW'S THE SENATE

01:48:33.874 --> 01:48:37.378 region:rollup2
CANNELLA.

01:48:36.777 --> 01:48:39.012 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A QUICK QUESTION IS

01:48:37.378 --> 01:48:41.081 region:rollup2
FOR IS THE THE MANAGEMENT OF THE

01:48:39.012 --> 01:48:42.449 region:rollup2
FUEL OTHER ANY REGULATORY.

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:43.884 region:rollup2
OBSTACLES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:46.020 region:rollup2
YOUR WAY FROM FROM PERFORMING

01:48:43.884 --> 01:48:46.520 region:rollup2
THOSE DUTIES AND IF SO WHAT ARE

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:47.755 region:rollup2
THEY AND HOW CAN THEY BE

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.322 region:rollup2
APPROVED.

01:48:47.755 --> 01:48:50.591 region:rollup2
I THANK YOU CENTER FOR THE

01:48:48.322 --> 01:48:51.992 region:rollup2
QUESTION I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

01:48:50.591 --> 01:48:52.960 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS THAT --

01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:54.495 region:rollup2
TO AS WAS ALLUDED TO A LITTLE

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.796 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT THE VEGETATION

01:48:54.495 --> 01:48:56.964 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT SITUATION.

01:48:55.796 --> 01:48:58.298 region:rollup2
IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN OTHER

01:48:56.964 --> 01:49:00.167 region:rollup2
PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:48:58.298 --> 01:49:02.035 region:rollup2
USING LIDAR SURVEYS WE ESTIMATE

01:49:00.167 --> 01:49:03.037 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED

01:49:02.035 --> 01:49:04.405 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY MILLION TREES THAT

01:49:03.037 --> 01:49:06.240 region:rollup2
COULD.

01:49:04.405 --> 01:49:07.674 region:rollup2
FALL INTO FOUR GROW INTO OUR

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.610 region:rollup2
POWERLINES.

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:11.445 region:rollup2
WAS SO ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES OR

01:49:09.610 --> 01:49:12.413 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON IS HOW DO WE

01:49:11.445 --> 01:49:13.614 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO DO THE

01:49:12.413 --> 01:49:15.115 region:rollup2
TYPES OF WORK TO GO ABOVE AND

01:49:13.614 --> 01:49:16.183 region:rollup2
BEYOND --

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:17.918 region:rollup2
MEETING THE COMPLIANCE

01:49:16.183 --> 01:49:19.186 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AND SO THE BIGGEST

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:21.321 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR US.

01:49:19.186 --> 01:49:22.589 region:rollup2
IS AND UTILITIES GENERALLY IS

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:24.224 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO GAIN PERMISSION

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:25.759 region:rollup2
FROM PROPERTY OWNERS TO DO THAT

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:29.163 region:rollup2
WORK AND SO.

01:49:25.759 --> 01:49:31.532 region:rollup2
I GIVING TOOLS THAT ALLOW US. TO

01:49:29.163 --> 01:49:32.933 region:rollup2
DO THAT IMPORTANT SAFETY WORK IT

01:49:31.532 --> 01:49:33.500 region:rollup2
IS REALLY A CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:35.069 region:rollup2
THAT -- IS

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.336 region:rollup2
NECESSARY SO ONLY PRIVATE

01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:37.738 region:rollup2
PROPERTY ACCESS THAT'S THAT'S

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:39.706 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST TOP SCORE THERE ANY

01:49:37.738 --> 01:49:40.607 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:49:39.706 --> 01:49:41.108 region:rollup2
FOR OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT

01:49:40.607 --> 01:49:42.743 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:49:41.108 --> 01:49:44.945 region:rollup2
A OP SCHOOLS FROM THE PERFORMING

01:49:42.743 --> 01:49:45.646 region:rollup2
THAT WORK ABSOLUTE OF SUBSTITUTE

01:49:44.945 --> 01:49:46.980 region:rollup2
AYE AYE HE'S YOU KNOW WHO

01:49:45.646 --> 01:49:48.649 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:50.717 region:rollup2
OWNERS BUT ALSO AGENCY LAND

01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:51.985 region:rollup2
MANAGER MANAGERS AND IT'S THE

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:53.854 region:rollup2
SAME ISSUE --

01:49:51.985 --> 01:49:55.556 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S EVEN MORE COMPLICATED

01:49:53.854 --> 01:49:57.057 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE THE

01:49:55.556 --> 01:49:58.459 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTAL LAND MANAGERS IN

01:49:57.057 --> 01:50:00.194 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE.

01:49:58.459 --> 01:50:01.195 region:rollup2
MANY MANY REGULATIONS AND LAWS

01:50:00.194 --> 01:50:01.762 region:rollup2
AND OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE

01:50:01.195 --> 01:50:03.664 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW ALL OF WHICH TAKE

01:50:01.762 --> 01:50:05.299 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:50:03.664 --> 01:50:07.167 region:rollup2
AND GET IN THE WAY OF DOING THIS

01:50:05.299 --> 01:50:08.335 region:rollup2
FOR THIS CRITICAL SAFETY WORK.

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:09.603 region:rollup2
WE'VE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS

01:50:08.335 --> 01:50:11.138 region:rollup2
WITH A WITH SOME OF THE FEDERAL

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:13.841 region:rollup2
AGENCIES SERVE --

01:50:11.138 --> 01:50:15.309 region:rollup2
THE OF US FOR SERVICE BUREAU

01:50:13.841 --> 01:50:16.944 region:rollup2
LAND MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS --

01:50:15.309 --> 01:50:17.611 region:rollup2
BUT IT STILL HASN'T YET TURNED

01:50:16.944 --> 01:50:18.946 region:rollup2
INTO --

01:50:17.611 --> 01:50:20.180 region:rollup2
REALLY A CLEAR PATH FOR

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:21.548 region:rollup2
COMPLETING THAT WORK.

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:23.717 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN DOING ABOUT

01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:25.085 region:rollup2
FEDERAL OF GOVERNMENT BUT IN THE

01:50:23.717 --> 01:50:26.620 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL ARE THERE

01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:28.122 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT ARE AT HAVE YOU

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:29.690 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AREAS.

01:50:28.122 --> 01:50:31.391 region:rollup2
THAT YOU WANT TO CLEAR OUT

01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:32.759 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF A FIRE HAZARD AND THE

01:50:31.391 --> 01:50:34.628 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCY HAS.

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:36.396 region:rollup2
HELD YOU UP TO WHERE YOU COULD

01:50:34.628 --> 01:50:38.465 region:rollup2
NOT PERFORM THOSE TASKS.

01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:39.099 region:rollup2
OKAY SO AS PART OF THIS SO THAT

01:50:38.465 --> 01:50:40.968 region:rollup2
THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS YES

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:41.869 region:rollup2
--

01:50:40.968 --> 01:50:43.036 region:rollup2
WE DEAL WITH --

01:50:41.869 --> 01:50:45.305 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF STATE PARKS

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:47.307 region:rollup2
CALTRANS --

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:49.142 region:rollup2
AND THOSE TYPES OF AGENCIES A

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:50.611 region:rollup2
PROBLEM MOST THAT WE DEAL WITH

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:51.578 region:rollup2
THE MOST OUT WE ALSO HAVE --

01:50:50.611 --> 01:50:53.814 region:rollup2
I GUESS THOSE ARE THE STATE

01:50:51.578 --> 01:50:54.381 region:rollup2
AGENCIES THAT ARE I THINK THE

01:50:53.814 --> 01:50:56.250 region:rollup2
THE THE LARGEST MANAGERS OF

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:57.784 region:rollup2
LAND.

01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:59.319 region:rollup2
HERE WHAT'S A TYPICAL TIME FRAME

01:50:57.784 --> 01:51:01.555 region:rollup2
IT I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO GET

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:03.023 region:rollup2
PERMITS TO TO CLEAR THAT LAND.

01:51:01.555 --> 01:51:05.759 region:rollup2
WHAT'S A TYPICAL TIMEFRAME FROM

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:07.427 region:rollup2
THE TIME TO THE TIME YOU GET A

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:08.095 region:rollup2

TREES.

01:51:08.095 --> 01:51:11.164 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE STILL IN PROCESS WITH

01:51:09.630 --> 01:51:12.900 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE NEW PROGRAM THAT

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:14.701 region:rollup2
I'VE TALKED ABOUT BUT WE YEAH

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:16.103 region:rollup2

HAZARD.

01:51:23.744 --> 01:51:25.846 region:rollup2
AND IS TAKING OVER SIX MONTHS

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:28.615 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE TO PROCESS THOSE

01:51:25.846 --> 01:51:29.983 region:rollup2
PERMITS.

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.651 region:rollup2

IDENTIFY AN AREA THAT'S LIKELY

01:51:39.993 --> 01:51:43.864 region:rollup2
TO CAUSE A BIG FIRE AND AND WHAT

01:51:42.329 --> 01:51:45.532 region:rollup2

PREVENT.

01:51:46.233 --> 01:51:49.937 region:rollup2
A NO THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S BY

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:51.905 region:rollup2
MEGHAN WERE WERE NEGOTIATING AND

01:51:49.937 --> 01:51:52.472 region:rollup2
CASE BY CASE BASIS WITH OCEAN

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:54.041 region:rollup2
WITH WHOM.

01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:55.242 region:rollup2
THE THE LAND MANAGERS WERE

01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:56.410 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS TO COMPLETE THAT

01:51:55.242 --> 01:51:57.244 region:rollup2
WORK IT WILL BUT LET'S PUT

01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:58.812 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS IN A DIFFERENT

01:51:57.244 --> 01:51:59.546 region:rollup2
CATEGORY OF A LOT OF TALK ABOUT

01:51:58.812 --> 01:52:00.247 region:rollup2
STEP THINK WE GOT A FRIEDMAN

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:01.815 region:rollup2
BILL THAT.

01:52:00.247 --> 01:52:03.483 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE YOU ACCESS TO PRIVATE

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:05.319 region:rollup2
PROBLEM ASSUMING YOUR SUPPORT OF

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:05.919 region:rollup2
THAT BILL YES ABSOLUTE COMES

01:52:05.319 --> 01:52:08.422 region:rollup2
BACK YOU KNOW LOOK FOR TALKING

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:10.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER AREAS.

01:52:08.422 --> 01:52:11.959 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING I THINK

01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:13.460 region:rollup2
FUEL MANAGEMENT REMOVAL OF THE

01:52:11.959 --> 01:52:14.695 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF A FIRE THAT FUEL.

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:16.330 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE GETTING IN OUR OWN

01:52:14.695 --> 01:52:17.731 region:rollup2
WAY AT THE STATE LEVEL I THINK

01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:18.298 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH THINK

01:52:17.731 --> 01:52:19.233 region:rollup2
THAT HE'S BE HIGHLY LA FEEL

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:20.901 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:52:19.233 --> 01:52:22.235 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT AGGRESSIVELY

01:52:20.901 --> 01:52:23.637 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE I FEEL

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:25.205 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU'RE I DON'T TRY TO BE

01:52:23.637 --> 01:52:26.940 region:rollup2
KIND OF THESE AGENCIES BUT IF

01:52:25.205 --> 01:52:28.242 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO CRAFT A BILL THAT

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:29.676 region:rollup2
THAT DEALS WITH THIS ISSUE THAT

01:52:28.242 --> 01:52:31.778 region:rollup2
HAS GOT TO BE PART OF THAT.

01:52:29.676 --> 01:52:33.747 region:rollup2
THAT PLANNED SO.

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:34.781 region:rollup2
IF THAT'S A PROBLEM I BET THINK

01:52:33.747 --> 01:52:36.283 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ESTA

01:52:34.781 --> 01:52:37.517 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND

01:52:36.283 --> 01:52:39.052 region:rollup2
HOW WE RESOLVE THAT ISSUE I

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:40.687 region:rollup2
THINK THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRICING

01:52:39.052 --> 01:52:42.522 region:rollup2
THAT POINT --

01:52:40.687 --> 01:52:43.123 region:rollup2
THAT IS AN ISSUE IN THIS IS A

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:44.157 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE NEED

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:46.994 region:rollup2

ANSWERS YES --

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:07.347 region:rollup2
I I THINK THE PRODUCT DAY

01:53:06.413 --> 01:53:09.750 region:rollup2
PRIVATE OWNERS HAVE BEEN

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:10.717 region:rollup2
PROBABLY JUST ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:12.019 region:rollup2
OF THE LARGER ISSUE VERSUS DEAL

01:53:10.717 --> 01:53:13.086 region:rollup2
WITH -- BUT

01:53:12.019 --> 01:53:14.421 region:rollup2
NONE WERE SUPPORT OF THAT

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:14.921 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION IS WHILE THE

01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:16.423 region:rollup2
HELPLESS --

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:17.658 region:rollup2
HELPLESS TO MORE AGGRESSIVELY

01:53:16.423 --> 01:53:18.158 region:rollup2
OUR OUR OWN IN THE TOUR JUST

01:53:17.658 --> 01:53:20.027 region:rollup2
PUTTING IN THE ORDER OF

01:53:18.158 --> 01:53:21.795 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT A

01:53:20.027 --> 01:53:23.297 region:rollup2
MILLION TREES IN INVENTORY.

01:53:21.795 --> 01:53:26.733 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>MUCH LIKE JUST EUGENIA</c></u>

01:53:23.297 --> 01:53:28.001 region:rollup2
CONFUSION ANYWHERE SO WE DO HAVE

01:53:26.733 --> 01:53:29.503 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO TRACK WHAT'S

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:31.171 region:rollup2
GOING ON THE QUESTION IS MOVING

01:53:29.503 --> 01:53:32.639 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY TO THOSE TRIMS AS

01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:35.275 region:rollup2
WE SEE WE NEED TO DO THAT.

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:36.510 region:rollup2
OUT WE TRIM AROUND A SEVEN

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:38.545 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR SO THE

01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:40.180 region:rollup2
AT THE VOLUME IS LARGE --

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:41.548 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT TWO

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:42.816 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TREES A DAY AND I IN

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:44.818 region:rollup2
OUR TERRITORY SO THIS IS A

01:53:42.816 --> 01:53:46.286 region:rollup2
ENORMOUS ISSUE AND MOVING THE

01:53:44.818 --> 01:53:47.621 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION LINE --

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:49.323 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIONS YOU THROUGH THAT

01:53:47.621 --> 01:53:51.358 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE A PERMIT

01:53:49.323 --> 01:53:52.292 region:rollup2
HANG UPS IS IMPORTANT.

01:53:51.358 --> 01:53:54.795 region:rollup2
THEY WERE BOTH THE SAME BUT I

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:56.596 region:rollup2
CAN'T GIVE YOU SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

01:53:54.795 --> 01:53:57.731 region:rollup2
FOR PROCEED IN CITIES BUT YOU

01:53:56.596 --> 01:53:58.365 region:rollup2
KNOW WE WERE ALWAYS OUT THERE

01:53:57.731 --> 01:54:00.500 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET THOSE [inaudible]

01:53:58.365 --> 01:54:01.902 region:rollup2
IN TERMS AND THERE THERE'S ALSO

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.370 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE AROUND --

01:54:01.902 --> 01:54:05.672 region:rollup2
PROJECTS IS WERE AS WERE HARD IN

01:54:03.370 --> 01:54:07.507 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM THE SEQUEL PROCESS

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:09.776 region:rollup2
CAN BE A LONG PROCESS AT TIMES

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:11.044 region:rollup2
TO ADD SOMETHING ELSE THAT --

01:54:09.776 --> 01:54:12.612 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE QUICKER WE GET THAT

01:54:11.044 --> 01:54:14.247 region:rollup2
DONE THE FASTER WE CAN IMPROVE

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:15.882 region:rollup2
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO.

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:17.884 region:rollup2
JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION SO WAS

01:54:15.882 --> 01:54:19.152 region:rollup2
IT A HUNTINGTON LAKE A COUPLE

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:21.121 region:rollup2
WEEKS HERE WHICH IS EDISON I

01:54:19.152 --> 01:54:22.456 region:rollup2
THINK UC CONTROLS THAT AREA.

01:54:21.121 --> 01:54:24.758 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE TERRINGTON OF NE

01:54:22.456 --> 01:54:25.392 region:rollup2
TAKING DOWN TREES BUT IT SEEMS

01:54:24.758 --> 01:54:26.259 region:rollup2
LIKE THEY'RE JUST BEING LEFT IN

01:54:25.392 --> 01:54:27.761 region:rollup2
PLACE.

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:29.062 region:rollup2
WHICH IS STILL FUEL AS FAR AS

01:54:27.761 --> 01:54:30.564 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED.

01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:32.666 region:rollup2
IS IS THAT PART OF THE ISSUE

01:54:30.564 --> 01:54:34.568 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO

01:54:32.666 --> 01:54:35.268 region:rollup2
TAKE THE TREES ONCE YOU TAKE

01:54:34.568 --> 01:54:36.970 region:rollup2
THEM DOWN.

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:38.739 region:rollup2
I AM NOT AWARE THAT HAS BEEN AN

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:40.674 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR US IN THERE IS SOME --

01:54:38.739 --> 01:54:41.942 region:rollup2
AREAS UP THERE THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:54:40.674 --> 01:54:42.776 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICE SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO

01:54:41.942 --> 01:54:44.478 region:rollup2
THIS IS A VERY REAL YOU'RE

01:54:42.776 --> 01:54:46.747 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT IS AN AREA WHERE

01:54:44.478 --> 01:54:48.782 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY --

01:54:46.747 --> 01:54:50.450 region:rollup2
USING LIGHTER TECHNOLOGY --

01:54:48.782 --> 01:54:52.919 region:rollup2
OUR OUR PLAN IS TO REMOVE THOSE

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:55.155 region:rollup2
BUT BUT DID AS FAR AS I KNOW THE

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:56.123 region:rollup2
AT THAT BEING AN IMPEDIMENT TO

01:54:55.155 --> 01:54:56.323 region:rollup2
TRIMMING HAS NOT BEEN ONE OF THE

01:54:56.123 --> 01:54:56.890 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:54:56.323 --> 01:54:59.259 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND SO SO YOU FEEL

01:54:56.890 --> 01:55:00.694 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:02.629 region:rollup2
THERE COULDN'T BE ADDITIONAL.

01:55:00.694 --> 01:55:04.631 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCES FOR YOU TAKE THOSE

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:05.465 region:rollup2
TREES ARE IN YOUR IF WE HAVE A

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:07.467 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE MILLION

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:09.403 region:rollup2
TREES OUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:10.270 region:rollup2
WITH THAT FUEL IS WHO LEGAL BILL

01:55:09.403 --> 01:55:11.171 region:rollup2
WOULD ALWAYS BE HOPEFUL HAVE A

01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:11.972 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR THEM TO GO AYE SO I

01:55:11.171 --> 01:55:12.639 region:rollup2
THINK ANYTHING THAT COULD.

01:55:11.972 --> 01:55:14.307 region:rollup2
RELIEVE THE POTENTIAL BOTTLENECK

01:55:12.639 --> 01:55:15.776 region:rollup2
WHETHER THERE'S ONE TODAY OR

01:55:14.307 --> 01:55:17.410 region:rollup2
WILL BE ONE IS HELPFUL SO

01:55:15.776 --> 01:55:19.012 region:rollup2
BIOMASS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO

01:55:17.410 --> 01:55:20.847 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH TREES THAT YOU HAVE

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:23.817 region:rollup2
TAKEN THE I'M REALLY COULDN'T

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:24.217 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO THE BY MASSIVE ISSUE

01:55:23.817 --> 01:55:25.418 region:rollup2
AND IN PARTICULAR.

01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:26.253 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:55:25.418 --> 01:55:27.487 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:55:26.253 --> 01:55:28.822 region:rollup2
WILL BE DEALING WITH THAT NEXT

01:55:27.487 --> 01:55:30.056 region:rollup2
WEEK DO YOU KNOW AS WELL A

01:55:28.822 --> 01:55:32.759 region:rollup2
CRISIS [inaudible]

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:34.027 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES.

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:35.829 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CAST THAT WE HAVE

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:37.798 region:rollup2
AT HAND.

01:55:35.829 --> 01:55:39.733 region:rollup2
HEALTH EACH OF YOU PRESENTED ARE

01:55:37.798 --> 01:55:42.769 region:rollup2
YOU PREPARED TO PRESENT TO THE

01:55:39.733 --> 01:55:46.973 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE YOUR PROPOSALS ON WHAT

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:48.542 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE INCLUDED.

01:55:46.973 --> 01:55:50.477 region:rollup2
I I'LL START WITH THAT --

01:55:48.542 --> 01:55:52.846 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK AND

01:55:50.477 --> 01:55:54.548 region:rollup2
WE'RE OPENING WERE OPEN TO

01:55:52.846 --> 01:55:56.283 region:rollup2
ADDING TO THAT FRAMEWORK --

01:55:54.548 --> 01:55:57.117 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PLAN THAT WE

01:55:56.283 --> 01:55:57.651 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED TO P. YOU SEE IN THE

01:55:57.117 --> 01:55:59.586 region:rollup2
CAN DOWN OVER THE LAST TWO

01:55:57.651 --> 01:56:01.254 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:55:59.586 --> 01:56:02.956 region:rollup2
IT IT'S NOT FOR THE EXACT SAME

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:05.058 region:rollup2
PURPOSE BUT BUT WE WE HAVE A

01:56:02.956 --> 01:56:07.027 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THERE AND DAY AND WE

01:56:05.058 --> 01:56:08.895 region:rollup2
WERE DEFINITE POSITION TO YOU

01:56:07.027 --> 01:56:10.363 region:rollup2
KNOW START THAT DISCUSSION.

01:56:08.895 --> 01:56:12.098 region:rollup2
AND I AYE BALANCE FOR US SO WE

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:13.166 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EDISON BUT WE ARE

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:13.767 region:rollup2
ALSO READY TO DO NOT HAVE THAT

01:56:13.166 --> 01:56:14.868 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AND KEVIN MENTIONED

01:56:13.767 --> 01:56:15.435 region:rollup2
--

01:56:14.868 --> 01:56:16.937 region:rollup2
AT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:56:15.435 --> 01:56:18.872 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION THAT IS ESPECIALLY

01:56:16.937 --> 01:56:19.973 region:rollup2
HAPPENED A VERY RECENTLY IS

01:56:18.872 --> 01:56:23.143 region:rollup2
WE'VE -- AS

01:56:19.973 --> 01:56:23.777 region:rollup2
AS FOR UTILITIES WE COULD

01:56:23.143 --> 01:56:26.012 region:rollup2
COLLABORATE ON ON GOOD PRACTICES

01:56:23.777 --> 01:56:27.047 region:rollup2
--

01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:28.381 region:rollup2
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A

01:56:27.047 --> 01:56:29.749 region:rollup2
POINT I HESITATE SAY BEST

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:30.350 region:rollup2
PRACTICES BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:56:29.749 --> 01:56:31.184 region:rollup2
POINTS WERE MADE A COUPLE OF

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:32.586 region:rollup2
TIMES.

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:34.020 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES

01:56:32.586 --> 01:56:35.822 region:rollup2
ARE DIFFERENT SO WHAT MAY BE

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:37.657 region:rollup2
BEST AND ONE UP MAY NOT BE BEST

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:38.892 region:rollup2
MOTHER THAT THAT POINT WAS MADE

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:39.926 region:rollup2
IN THE EARLY DISCUSSIONS.

01:56:38.892 --> 01:56:41.261 region:rollup2
BUT HAVING SAID THAT --

01:56:39.926 --> 01:56:42.729 region:rollup2
WE WE HAVE A PLAN AND A

01:56:41.261 --> 01:56:44.631 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK I WILL BE MAKING A

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:46.066 region:rollup2
FILING AT THE COMMISSION UP FOR

01:56:44.631 --> 01:56:46.967 region:rollup2
SOME ADDITIONAL WORK WE EXPECT

01:56:46.066 --> 01:56:47.501 region:rollup2
TO DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF

01:56:46.967 --> 01:56:48.768 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:49.903 region:rollup2
ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:51.838 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE ONE ELEMENT OF

01:56:49.903 --> 01:56:52.973 region:rollup2
FORMS BASIS A FURTHER DISCUSSION

01:56:51.838 --> 01:56:54.140 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHAT STANDARDS

01:56:52.973 --> 01:56:54.608 region:rollup2
SHOULD OR COULD BE.

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:56.610 region:rollup2
UP WERE READY FOR THE

01:56:54.608 --> 01:56:58.011 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:59.279 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT --

01:56:58.011 --> 01:57:00.847 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE PHIL MENTIONED THAT

01:56:59.279 --> 01:57:02.949 region:rollup2
WE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:04.584 region:rollup2
CLEVERLY COST ACROSS THE AISLE

01:57:02.949 --> 01:57:06.386 region:rollup2
USE HERE TO DEVELOP A A BASIC

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:07.254 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK IN THE THAT THE IDEA

01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:08.588 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THAT.

01:57:07.254 --> 01:57:10.123 region:rollup2
ALL THREE OF THE INVESTOR OWNED

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:11.625 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WOULD USE THAT SAME

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:13.393 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK AND AGREE ON THE

01:57:11.625 --> 01:57:14.561 region:rollup2
COMMON PRACTICES THAT MAKE MOST

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:16.530 region:rollup2
THE MOST SENSE.

01:57:14.561 --> 01:57:17.731 region:rollup2
HAVE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:19.699 region:rollup2
AND A SUPPLEMENT THAT WITH

01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:20.700 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:21.668 region:rollup2
UNIQUE.

01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:24.337 region:rollup2
TO EACH OF THE COMPANY SERVICE

01:57:21.668 --> 01:57:24.938 region:rollup2
TERRITORIES HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:25.906 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCES

01:57:24.938 --> 01:57:35.949 region:rollup2
IN.

01:57:25.906 --> 01:57:36.516 region:rollup2
OF THE VEGETATION AND TYPOLOGY

01:57:35.949 --> 01:57:36.783 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THOSE TYPES OF

01:57:36.516 --> 01:57:37.384 region:rollup2
THINGS --

01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:38.084 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WITH WITH MILLION

01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:39.252 region:rollup2
AND HALF OF SO WHAT IS THE BEST

01:57:38.084 --> 01:57:40.620 region:rollup2
MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:43.590 region:rollup2
WILD FARM OF RISK [inaudible]

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:44.591 region:rollup2
CENTER STONE.

01:57:43.590 --> 01:57:45.792 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU ARE MISTER CHAIR

01:57:44.591 --> 01:57:47.227 region:rollup2
ENDOWMENT DON'T THINK APPEAR

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:48.328 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY --

01:57:47.227 --> 01:57:49.729 region:rollup2
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT

01:57:48.328 --> 01:57:51.731 region:rollup2
ON NOW CENTER CANNELLA IS --

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:53.433 region:rollup2
COMMENTS HAVE HUNDRED TWENTY

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:54.367 region:rollup2
NINE MILLION A DEAD OR DYING

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:56.036 region:rollup2
TREES.

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:57.137 region:rollup2
AND AND SPEAKING WITH SOME OF

01:57:56.036 --> 01:57:58.471 region:rollup2
THE UTILITIES --

01:57:57.137 --> 01:58:00.507 region:rollup2
ENOUGH AND A PRIVATE DATA

01:57:58.471 --> 01:58:03.076 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION --

01:58:00.507 --> 01:58:05.178 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE A SEQUEL COMES UP AND

01:58:03.076 --> 01:58:06.713 region:rollup2
IMPEDING YOUR ABILITY TO GET RID

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:07.948 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THE THE FUELS OUT

01:58:06.713 --> 01:58:09.349 region:rollup2
THERE COULD YOU EACH DISTRICT

01:58:07.948 --> 01:58:10.617 region:rollup2
REFLECT ON WHAT.

01:58:09.349 --> 01:58:12.152 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN

01:58:10.617 --> 01:58:13.453 region:rollup2
WITH SEAQUEST THAT WOULD BETTER

01:58:12.152 --> 01:58:15.388 region:rollup2
ENABLE YOU TO DO.

01:58:13.453 --> 01:58:18.158 region:rollup2
YOUR JOB OF CLEARING VEGETATION

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:19.759 region:rollup2
AND AROUND YOUR LINES.

01:58:18.158 --> 01:58:20.527 region:rollup2
SO I'LL ALL STARTIN --

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:22.162 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE

01:58:20.527 --> 01:58:23.330 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES A THAT --

01:58:22.162 --> 01:58:24.831 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE FACED WITH RESPECT

01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:26.099 region:rollup2
TO THAT AND ALL I WILL GO TO THE

01:58:24.831 --> 01:58:27.033 region:rollup2
QUESTION ABOUT WHO WOULD HAVE

01:58:26.099 --> 01:58:28.234 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE WE BEEN DOING WITH

01:58:27.033 --> 01:58:30.070 region:rollup2
THE TREES THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:58:28.234 --> 01:58:32.939 region:rollup2
REMOVING SO AND IMPEACHING

01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:34.541 region:rollup2
SERVICE AREA WE'VE HAD POOR THAT

01:58:32.939 --> 01:58:36.042 region:rollup2
WERE JUST DEVASTATED BY.

01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:37.844 region:rollup2
TREE MORTALITY SO WE'VE BEEN

01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:39.479 region:rollup2
REMOVING --

01:58:37.844 --> 01:58:40.880 region:rollup2
WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:42.949 region:rollup2
THOSE TREES EVERY YEAR IT TOOK

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:45.952 region:rollup2
US ABOUT A YEAR TO STAND UP AND

01:58:42.949 --> 01:58:47.387 region:rollup2
GET PERMITS INCLUDING SEQUEL TO

01:58:45.952 --> 01:58:48.588 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLACE TO PUT BACK --

01:58:47.387 --> 01:58:50.457 region:rollup2
PUT THAT WOULD WE'VE WE WERE

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:52.692 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ESTABLISH UP WE HAD TO

01:58:50.457 --> 01:58:55.161 region:rollup2
FIRE ATHAT A FILE ON A LUMBER

01:58:52.692 --> 01:58:55.595 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THE VARIOUS

01:58:55.161 --> 01:58:56.529 region:rollup2
OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

01:58:55.595 --> 01:58:58.665 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

01:58:56.529 --> 01:59:00.967 region:rollup2
AND SO I STREAMLINING IN A

01:58:58.665 --> 01:59:02.469 region:rollup2
DELICATE IDENTIFYING A LEAD

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:03.670 region:rollup2
AGENCY THAT ADDRESSES THAT.

01:59:02.469 --> 01:59:05.772 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:59:03.670 --> 01:59:06.973 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS THE LEAD AGENCY

01:59:05.772 --> 01:59:08.508 region:rollup2
FOR MOST OF THE WORK THAT WE DO

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:10.744 region:rollup2
IS UTILITIES --

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:12.145 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS HOGAN HAVING A SINGLE

01:59:10.744 --> 01:59:13.380 region:rollup2
LEAD AGENCY WITH A CLEAR MISSION

01:59:12.145 --> 01:59:15.148 region:rollup2
IN MIND.

01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:15.782 region:rollup2
OUT WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:59:15.148 --> 01:59:16.850 region:rollup2
ENHANCEMENT RELATIVE TO THE WORK

01:59:15.782 --> 01:59:17.984 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO.

01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:19.586 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE SAYING IT IT BASICALLY

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.654 region:rollup2
TAKES A YEAR TO GET OF THE

01:59:19.586 --> 01:59:22.088 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO GET A TRUE BOOTING

01:59:20.654 --> 01:59:24.457 region:rollup2
INTO TOOK PLACE WORK IN THE

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:25.692 region:rollup2
COMPOST ENTERED OR DESTROYED.

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:27.494 region:rollup2
BY I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT'S WHAT

01:59:25.692 --> 01:59:28.628 region:rollup2
TOOK US TO CREATE THE STAGING

01:59:27.494 --> 01:59:29.896 region:rollup2
AREA.

01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:31.498 region:rollup2
THAT WE NOW USE ON A REGULAR

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:32.432 region:rollup2
BASIS SO WERE ABLE TO PICK UP

01:59:31.498 --> 01:59:33.900 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD INTO AN OVERLY

01:59:32.432 --> 01:59:35.001 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PETER PLANTS ARE

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:36.069 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IN THE IN THE COMING

01:59:35.001 --> 01:59:37.437 region:rollup2
WEEK BUT I KNOW THAT DAN

01:59:36.069 --> 01:59:38.104 region:rollup2
SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE KICKER

01:59:37.437 --> 01:59:39.973 region:rollup2
PLANTE --

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:41.508 region:rollup2
FOLKS WE GOT ABOUT TWENTY OF IN

01:59:39.973 --> 01:59:42.575 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF WE

01:59:41.508 --> 01:59:44.110 region:rollup2
HAD UNLIMITED FINANCIAL

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:45.512 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ACCORDING TO THEM

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:46.946 region:rollup2
MAYBE TWELVE YEARS. TO GET RID

01:59:45.512 --> 01:59:48.181 region:rollup2
OF A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE BILLION

01:59:46.946 --> 01:59:50.050 region:rollup2
TREES THERE SOME PICKERS.

01:59:48.181 --> 01:59:53.019 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON THE VERGE

01:59:50.050 --> 01:59:54.387 region:rollup2
OF CLOSING THE FAST ENOUGH FOR

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.888 region:rollup2
THE DAY TO STAY IN BUSINESS SO

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:56.022 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF AN URGENT

01:59:54.888 --> 01:59:57.524 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:59:56.022 --> 01:59:59.392 region:rollup2
COMING NEXT QUESTION IS --

01:59:57.524 --> 02:00:00.093 region:rollup2
FOR FC -- IS

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:01.194 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW --

02:00:00.093 --> 02:00:02.929 region:rollup2
OR NO NO I REPRESENT THE

02:00:01.194 --> 02:00:03.797 region:rollup2
IDYLLWILD AREA WE JUST HAVE THE

02:00:02.929 --> 02:00:05.965 region:rollup2
CRANSTON FIRE THAT WAS STARTED

02:00:03.797 --> 02:00:08.268 region:rollup2
BY AN ARSONIST WHICH IS A VERY

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:09.969 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE SITUATION --

02:00:08.268 --> 02:00:11.938 region:rollup2
WHILE I WAS UP THERE TOURING --

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:14.140 region:rollup2
THE SITE AND WITNESSING THE

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:17.043 region:rollup2
GREAT WORK OF HELLFIRE AND ALL

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:18.278 region:rollup2
THE THE BACKUP FIRE AGENCIES

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:20.747 region:rollup2
KEEPING THAT FIRE OUT OF THE

02:00:18.278 --> 02:00:22.515 region:rollup2
CORPS OF IDYLLWILD IMPLYING CHO.

02:00:20.747 --> 02:00:24.217 region:rollup2
I I NOTICE THAT THE TRANSMISSION

02:00:22.515 --> 02:00:25.885 region:rollup2
LINES INTO AND I NOTICED SOME

02:00:24.217 --> 02:00:26.352 region:rollup2
VERY DISTURBING PICTURES WHICH I

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.520 region:rollup2
LOVE TO SHARE WITH YOU

02:00:26.352 --> 02:00:29.589 region:rollup2
PRIVATELY.

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:30.890 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWS ELECTRICAL LINES

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:33.226 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH TREES.

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:34.627 region:rollup2
NOW THIS FIRE WAS AN ARSONIST

02:00:33.226 --> 02:00:35.729 region:rollup2
FIRE THAT STARTED AT THE BOTTOM

02:00:34.627 --> 02:00:37.564 region:rollup2
OF THE HILL.

02:00:35.729 --> 02:00:38.431 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

02:00:37.564 --> 02:00:39.966 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN HIGH TO ON

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:43.670 region:rollup2
HIGH GOAL FOR A FULL TIME.

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:44.704 region:rollup2
THIRD TWO WAYS AND INTO A TIME

02:00:43.670 --> 02:00:46.372 region:rollup2
TO EVACUATE THAT HILL NOT

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.840 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT THAT FIRE WAS GOING

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:48.475 region:rollup2
TO REACH A LOT OF THE

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:49.809 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL UNITS.

02:00:48.475 --> 02:00:51.411 region:rollup2
BUT HAD A WHILE WIRES SPARK IN A

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:53.847 region:rollup2
WIN EVENT.

02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:54.914 region:rollup2
IN IDYLLWILD AND IT HAPPENED IN

02:00:53.847 --> 02:00:57.150 region:rollup2
THE COR.

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:57.751 region:rollup2
WE MAY NOT BE JUST TALKING ABOUT

02:00:57.150 --> 02:00:58.685 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES THAT

02:00:57.751 --> 02:01:00.386 region:rollup2
WERE LOST IN OF COURSE WE

02:00:58.685 --> 02:01:01.654 region:rollup2
EMPATHIZE WITH ALL THE RESIDENTS

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:03.089 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE

02:01:01.654 --> 02:01:04.724 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN THAT DAMAGE BUT WE CAN

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:05.358 region:rollup2
REPLACE HOMES.

02:01:04.724 --> 02:01:08.862 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN DISCUSS THE FINANCES

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:09.462 region:rollup2
OF THAT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:01:08.862 --> 02:01:10.163 region:rollup2
THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:01:09.462 --> 02:01:11.598 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE INCINERATED.

02:01:10.163 --> 02:01:13.833 region:rollup2
AYE IF WE DON'T APPROPRIATELY

02:01:11.598 --> 02:01:15.802 region:rollup2
GET OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:16.936 region:rollup2
UNDER CONTROL IN AND AROUND OUR

02:01:15.802 --> 02:01:18.905 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND OF COURSE GETTING

02:01:16.936 --> 02:01:19.405 region:rollup2
RID OF FIVE DEAD TREES

02:01:18.905 --> 02:01:20.440 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:21.441 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:23.109 region:rollup2
SO.

02:01:21.441 --> 02:01:24.978 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ENHANCE THAT

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:26.279 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SO WE CAN

02:01:24.978 --> 02:01:27.881 region:rollup2
GIVE A COMFORT LEVEL?

02:01:26.279 --> 02:01:29.449 region:rollup2
OUT TO THESE PEOPLE AND IT UP AS

02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:31.851 region:rollup2
A PART OF RISK ASSESSMENT AS A

02:01:29.449 --> 02:01:33.052 region:rollup2
PART OF SCE TO LOOK AT AREAS

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:34.654 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COME FIND.

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:36.789 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE DO HAVE A WILDFIRE WE

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:38.458 region:rollup2
COULD SEE AN INK A MUCH HIGHER

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:39.592 region:rollup2
INCIDENCE OF MORTALITY AS

02:01:38.458 --> 02:01:40.994 region:rollup2
OPPOSED.

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:42.362 region:rollup2
TO DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE

02:01:40.994 --> 02:01:44.264 region:rollup2
TO PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS

02:01:42.362 --> 02:01:45.999 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY SO BOB BOB DOLE

02:01:44.264 --> 02:01:47.734 region:rollup2
START WITH OF A FIRST --

02:01:45.999 --> 02:01:50.136 region:rollup2
COUPLE IN AND BY THE WAY --

02:01:47.734 --> 02:01:52.939 region:rollup2
I'D BEEN FOLLOWING THE CRATCHIT

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:53.573 region:rollup2
FAR VERY CLOSELY OBVIOUSLY --

02:01:52.939 --> 02:01:56.910 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW OUR TEAMS THROUGHOUT

02:01:53.573 --> 02:01:59.179 region:rollup2
THE AND THANKFULLY THAT WAS --

02:01:56.910 --> 02:02:00.880 region:rollup2
WAS EXTINGUISHED A RELATIVELY

02:01:59.179 --> 02:02:01.481 region:rollup2
QUICKLY I KNOW THE ANSWER COOPER

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.148 region:rollup2
AS OUT THERE AS WELL SO WE HAD

02:02:01.481 --> 02:02:04.350 region:rollup2
--

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:05.518 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF THOSE

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:08.421 region:rollup2
LINES WHO LOST POWER.

02:02:05.518 --> 02:02:09.789 region:rollup2
ON RELATIVE TO OF AND THE

02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:11.491 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT STANDARDS

02:02:09.789 --> 02:02:13.193 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE APPROACH THAT AND AND

02:02:11.491 --> 02:02:13.827 region:rollup2
MAYBE TO A POINT IN PARTICULAR.

02:02:13.193 --> 02:02:15.061 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS WHERE STANDARDS

02:02:13.827 --> 02:02:16.696 region:rollup2
--

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:17.964 region:rollup2
AS WE CAN ALL ALIGNED ON THEM

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:19.332 region:rollup2
ARE CRITICAL.

02:02:17.964 --> 02:02:20.600 region:rollup2
I ON THE DEPENDING ON THE LINE

02:02:19.332 --> 02:02:22.035 region:rollup2
OF FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS TRULY

02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:23.603 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION LINE VERSES THE

02:02:22.035 --> 02:02:25.371 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION LINES --

02:02:23.603 --> 02:02:26.172 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AUTHORITY AND RIGHTS AND

02:02:25.371 --> 02:02:27.240 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DO ADDITIONAL

02:02:26.172 --> 02:02:29.142 region:rollup2
TRIMMING FOR EXAMPLE

02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.310 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION LINE HOW WE HAVE

02:02:29.142 --> 02:02:31.010 region:rollup2
RIGHTS OF WAY WE HAVE THE

02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:32.312 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO CREATE MORE

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:33.046 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVELY.

02:02:32.312 --> 02:02:34.747 region:rollup2
AND A SOMETHING WERE MOVING

02:02:33.046 --> 02:02:37.250 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH ON DISTRIBUTION

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:37.884 region:rollup2
LINES WHICH I OBVIOUSLY CAN LOOK

02:02:37.250 --> 02:02:39.118 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR TRANSMISSION LINES

02:02:37.884 --> 02:02:40.119 region:rollup2
--

02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:41.988 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE A SIMILAR RIGHTS

02:02:40.119 --> 02:02:43.289 region:rollup2
OF WAY AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE

02:02:41.988 --> 02:02:44.557 region:rollup2
WE ARE AGGRESSIVE AS A SINGER

02:02:43.289 --> 02:02:45.992 region:rollup2
GAS LIKE FIGURES.

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:47.827 region:rollup2
AND MOVING VEGETATIONS THOSE

02:02:45.992 --> 02:02:48.895 region:rollup2
LINES WE HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL

02:02:47.827 --> 02:02:50.163 region:rollup2
OF AUTHORITY SO THREE THAT'S

02:02:48.895 --> 02:02:51.731 region:rollup2
REALLY BE HEARD UP TO YOU BUT DO

02:02:50.163 --> 02:02:53.499 region:rollup2
YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT'S AN AREA

02:02:51.731 --> 02:02:55.735 region:rollup2
WHERE WE SHOULD BE REGULATING

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:57.070 region:rollup2
THAT WITH ANCILLARY STRUCTURES

02:02:55.735 --> 02:02:58.204 region:rollup2
AND ACT AS SALES THAT COULD.

02:02:57.070 --> 02:02:59.772 region:rollup2
CREATE PROBLEMS FOR YOUR

02:02:58.204 --> 02:03:01.808 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION LINES HIGH I THINK

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:02.709 region:rollup2
I COULD MAYBE TAKE A STEP BACK

02:03:01.808 --> 02:03:04.878 region:rollup2
TO QUESTION ABOUT --

02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:07.947 region:rollup2
THAT IT IN THIS CONVERSATION WAS

02:03:04.878 --> 02:03:09.182 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH THE LAST DISCUSSION

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:10.216 region:rollup2
WITH CHAIRMAN PICKER --

02:03:09.182 --> 02:03:11.818 region:rollup2
HAVING STANDARDS INCONSISTENT

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:13.453 region:rollup2
STANDARDS ACROSS THAT STATION

02:03:11.818 --> 02:03:14.921 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT AND OTHER THINGS IS A

02:03:13.453 --> 02:03:18.391 region:rollup2
REALLY TO WILDFIRE --

02:03:14.921 --> 02:03:19.859 region:rollup2
THAT THE UTILITIES A OUR REALLY

02:03:18.391 --> 02:03:21.461 region:rollup2
BE HAD COME PART OF THEIR

02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:23.196 region:rollup2
WELFARE MANAGING PLAN IS A

02:03:21.461 --> 02:03:24.564 region:rollup2
HELPFUL THING I I OBVIOUSLY MORE

02:03:23.196 --> 02:03:26.165 region:rollup2
DIRECTION IN THAT AREA --

02:03:24.564 --> 02:03:28.234 region:rollup2
REPAIRS MORE REQUIREMENTS BUT I

02:03:26.165 --> 02:03:28.768 region:rollup2
THINK IN MANY CASES --

02:03:28.234 --> 02:03:29.869 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL DIRECTION TO BE

02:03:28.768 --> 02:03:31.704 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

02:03:29.869 --> 02:03:32.839 region:rollup2
SO I GET AGAIN AND OBVIOUSLY

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:35.341 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR

02:03:32.839 --> 02:03:37.377 region:rollup2
LINES INCLUDING THOSE AND IN THE

02:03:35.341 --> 02:03:38.945 region:rollup2
IT OUT AWHILE THERE AND WE HAVE.

02:03:37.377 --> 02:03:40.513 region:rollup2
A INGRESS AND EGRESS --

02:03:38.945 --> 02:03:42.181 region:rollup2
PART OF THE HIGH FIRE AREA

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:44.083 region:rollup2
DESIGNATIONS TWO AND THREE

02:03:42.181 --> 02:03:46.152 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DO INCORPORATE --

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:48.388 region:rollup2
EGRESS INGRESS AND OF THE NUMBER

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:50.490 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS FUEL LOADING SUSAN

02:03:48.388 --> 02:03:52.425 region:rollup2
LAYER OF THAT ITEM THOSE

02:03:50.490 --> 02:03:53.059 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS GO INTO PRIORITIZATION

02:03:52.425 --> 02:03:54.694 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY FOR VEGETATION

02:03:53.059 --> 02:03:56.996 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO

02:03:54.694 --> 02:03:58.665 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE REPLACEMENT --

02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:59.332 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUE HERE LATEST EUGENE

02:03:58.665 --> 02:04:00.867 region:rollup2
MENTION A SMALL WIRE PLACE FROM

02:03:59.332 --> 02:04:02.502 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE HAVE HAD THAT UNDER

02:04:00.867 --> 02:04:03.803 region:rollup2
WAY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WERE

02:04:02.502 --> 02:04:04.804 region:rollup2
ACCELERATING THAT IN HIGH FIRE

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:06.506 region:rollup2
AREAS.

02:04:04.804 --> 02:04:08.541 region:rollup2
SAME WITH POLL REPLACEMENTS WE

02:04:06.506 --> 02:04:09.142 region:rollup2
DO TARGET AREAS WHO WE THINK ARE

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:10.343 region:rollup2
MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHERS SO

02:04:09.142 --> 02:04:12.512 region:rollup2
--

02:04:10.343 --> 02:04:13.947 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMPLEX ANALYSIS BUT BUT

02:04:12.512 --> 02:04:14.981 region:rollup2
THIS THE THE ELEMENTS THAT

02:04:13.947 --> 02:04:16.716 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I'D

02:04:14.981 --> 02:04:18.251 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY FACTOR IN TO HOW WE

02:04:16.716 --> 02:04:19.852 region:rollup2
ASSESS AN AREA AND HOW WE FOCUS

02:04:18.251 --> 02:04:21.688 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCES IN A PRIORITY

02:04:19.852 --> 02:04:23.790 region:rollup2
BASIS -- TO

02:04:21.688 --> 02:04:25.725 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TRIM VEGETATION ADDRESS

02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:26.793 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES I'M AND

02:04:25.725 --> 02:04:28.261 region:rollup2
AND REALLY RESPOND TO THE

02:04:26.793 --> 02:04:29.862 region:rollup2
WELFARE SYSTEM JUST ONE FINAL

02:04:28.261 --> 02:04:32.966 region:rollup2
BUT QUESTION --

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:33.1000 region:rollup2
WE HEARD FROM THE PC THAT THEY

02:04:32.966 --> 02:04:36.369 region:rollup2
BASICALLY HAVE. THIRTY AUDITOR'S

02:04:33.1000 --> 02:04:37.737 region:rollup2
BETTER IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING

02:04:36.369 --> 02:04:39.505 region:rollup2
ALL THESE LINES THOUSANDS OF

02:04:37.737 --> 02:04:42.008 region:rollup2
MILES OF LINES.

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:42.809 region:rollup2
AND TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE THERE

02:04:42.008 --> 02:04:44.344 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE --

02:04:42.809 --> 02:04:46.012 region:rollup2
A MORE DEFINITIVE PARTNERSHIP

02:04:44.344 --> 02:04:50.550 region:rollup2
WITH HELLFIRE --

02:04:46.012 --> 02:04:52.618 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT. FOR IT OVERSIGHT

02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:53.152 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE HELPING YOU

02:04:52.618 --> 02:04:54.420 region:rollup2
pWITH YOUR YOUR VEGETATION

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:55.688 region:rollup2
ISSUES

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:56.856 region:rollup2
OF WHICH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:04:55.688 --> 02:04:57.857 region:rollup2
YOU WOULD ENCOURAGE A PC TO

02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:59.759 region:rollup2
ENTERTAIN A MORE DEFINITIVE

02:04:57.857 --> 02:05:00.393 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH A HELLFIRE

02:04:59.759 --> 02:05:02.595 region:rollup2
FIRE MARSHALS AND ENSURING THAT

02:05:00.393 --> 02:05:03.096 region:rollup2
--

02:05:02.595 --> 02:05:04.197 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT BEING

02:05:03.096 --> 02:05:05.231 region:rollup2
COUNTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:05:04.197 --> 02:05:06.265 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE LINES AND HAVE

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:07.533 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND FIRE

02:05:06.265 --> 02:05:09.302 region:rollup2
DYNAMICS LOVE THEM MORE

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:10.169 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVELY I I I THINK THAT

02:05:09.302 --> 02:05:11.137 region:rollup2
COULD BE VERY HELPFUL THERE'S

02:05:10.169 --> 02:05:12.705 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY --

02:05:11.137 --> 02:05:14.007 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT OF A MODEL LEASE A

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:16.976 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OF

02:05:14.007 --> 02:05:18.244 region:rollup2
UTILITIES AND CAL FIRE IS THE OF

02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:19.145 region:rollup2
PARTY LINE FEEL PREVENTION A

02:05:18.244 --> 02:05:20.747 region:rollup2
FIELD GUIDE.

02:05:19.145 --> 02:05:21.881 region:rollup2
IT REALLY ADDRESSES DEVICES BUT

02:05:20.747 --> 02:05:23.616 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S A VEHICLE THAT

02:05:21.881 --> 02:05:24.751 region:rollup2
THAT'S A DOCUMENT UPDATED EVERY

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:26.386 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS IT'S IN ITS RENEWAL

02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:27.587 region:rollup2
CYCLE RIGHT NOW IS THAT MIGHT BE

02:05:26.386 --> 02:05:29.188 region:rollup2
A PLACE.

02:05:27.587 --> 02:05:30.123 region:rollup2
OF TRADITIONAL COLLABORATION

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:31.691 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THERE OR NOT I

02:05:30.123 --> 02:05:34.761 region:rollup2
THINK THAT LEVELS COLLABORATIONS

02:05:31.691 --> 02:05:36.195 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY HELPFUL PROCUREMENT.

02:05:34.761 --> 02:05:38.598 region:rollup2
BUT SENATOR --

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:39.532 region:rollup2
JACKSON BLAST LAST ONE IT THANK

02:05:38.598 --> 02:05:42.835 region:rollup2
YOU -- GET

02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:50.076 region:rollup2
pSEQUEL WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT

02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:52.044 region:rollup2
THE KINDS OF THE KINDS OF

02:05:50.076 --> 02:05:54.881 region:rollup2
BONUSES THAT HAVE BEEN PAID TO

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:56.849 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE LEADERSHIP IN.

02:05:54.881 --> 02:05:58.684 region:rollup2
A PARTICULAR NO P. CHENEY HAS

02:05:56.849 --> 02:06:00.253 region:rollup2
GIVEN SOME SIGNIFICANT BONUSES

02:05:58.684 --> 02:06:01.254 region:rollup2
SAID THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE THAT

02:06:00.253 --> 02:06:02.755 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT MONEY WOULD BE BETTER

02:06:01.254 --> 02:06:04.157 region:rollup2
SPENT.

02:06:02.755 --> 02:06:08.261 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO MANAGEMENT PLANS

02:06:04.157 --> 02:06:09.695 region:rollup2
BUT KEEPING IN MIND THAT THAT

02:06:08.261 --> 02:06:12.632 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SAFETY IS I THINK.

02:06:09.695 --> 02:06:14.267 region:rollup2
HAPPILY FINALLY A ON EVERYONE'S

THAT SAFETY IS IMPORTANT --

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:05.618 region:rollup2

ON THE SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:34.480 region:rollup2
THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC THAT WE

02:07:31.677 --> 02:07:36.949 region:rollup2
SERVE AS WE CONSIDER THAT --

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:38.551 region:rollup2
WE HAVE DEVELOPED A A NUMBER OF

02:07:36.949 --> 02:07:40.353 region:rollup2
HIGH WEEK BUT WE'RE CALLING OUR

02:07:38.551 --> 02:07:42.188 region:rollup2
ONE PGD SAFETY PROGRAM.

02:07:40.353 --> 02:07:44.290 region:rollup2
WHICH FOCUSES ON A EMPLOYEE

02:07:42.188 --> 02:07:45.491 region:rollup2
SAFETY CONTRACTOR SAFETY AND

02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:47.493 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:50.229 region:rollup2
AND IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:51.864 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING.

02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:53.199 region:rollup2
CROSSED OUR AND ACROSS OUR

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:54.167 region:rollup2
ENTIRE ORGANIZATION EVERY LINE

02:07:53.199 --> 02:07:55.768 region:rollup2
OF BUSINESS.

02:07:54.167 --> 02:07:59.138 region:rollup2
DOING IT THE SAME WAY LEVER

02:07:55.768 --> 02:08:01.073 region:rollup2
PRACTICE --

02:07:59.138 --> 02:08:01.707 region:rollup2
THE THE OTHER OTHER ASPECT THAT

02:08:01.073 --> 02:08:03.509 region:rollup2
I WOULD MENTION IS THAT WE HAVE

02:08:01.707 --> 02:08:06.145 region:rollup2
--

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:08.114 region:rollup2
CREATED AN OFFICER LEVEL SAFETY

02:08:06.145 --> 02:08:10.983 region:rollup2

INTERACTING WITH THE BOARD ON A

02:08:16.556 --> 02:08:19.458 region:rollup2
REGULAR BASIS IN TERMS OF WHAT

02:08:17.924 --> 02:08:20.226 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT MANAGEMENT IS DOING

02:08:19.458 --> 02:08:20.826 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS.

02:08:20.226 --> 02:08:22.595 region:rollup2
ON THAT AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:25.097 region:rollup2
--

02:08:22.595 --> 02:08:27.500 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO HOW FOCUSING ON

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:28.568 region:rollup2
GRASSROOTS SAFETY SO REALLY.

02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:30.102 region:rollup2
SAFETY THAT IS IMPLEMENTED BY

02:08:28.568 --> 02:08:30.736 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE ON THE FIELD AND

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:32.305 region:rollup2
OWNED BY THE PEOPLE IN THE FIELD

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:34.907 region:rollup2
--

02:08:32.305 --> 02:08:36.375 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT

02:08:34.907 --> 02:08:37.877 region:rollup2
I'M HARD REALLY HARD.

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:39.478 region:rollup2
DETERMINING HOW THINGS ARE GONNA

02:08:37.877 --> 02:08:41.180 region:rollup2
HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF THAT.

02:08:39.478 --> 02:08:42.615 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR DAY AND

02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:44.183 region:rollup2

COUPLE THINGS I WOULD MENTION

02:08:52.325 --> 02:08:54.927 region:rollup2
THEIR ONE OF THE HIGH.

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:56.729 region:rollup2
THAT ONE OF THE KEY AREAS THAT

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:57.797 region:rollup2
WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS --

02:08:56.729 --> 02:09:01.267 region:rollup2

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:47.373 region:rollup2
OUR HOUSE ARE POWER LINES THIS

02:10:45.071 --> 02:10:48.774 region:rollup2
IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

02:10:47.373 --> 02:10:50.042 region:rollup2
ONE THAT HAS DOUBLED --

02:10:48.774 --> 02:10:52.645 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS SO THE

02:10:50.042 --> 02:10:54.980 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE QUESTION IS IS THIS

02:10:52.645 --> 02:10:57.083 region:rollup2
ENOUGH I REALIZED LOT MONEY YOU

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:59.418 region:rollup2
HAVE THE BIG TERRITORY YOU'VE

02:10:57.083 --> 02:11:01.987 region:rollup2
GOT A LOT OF THE TO COVER.

02:10:59.418 --> 02:11:03.255 region:rollup2
IS THIS IS THIS PROGRAM IS IT

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:05.391 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THE P. YOU SEE HAS

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:08.661 region:rollup2
CREPT DIRECTED YOU TO DO OR SHE

02:11:05.391 --> 02:11:11.497 region:rollup2
IS THIS YOUR INDIVIDUAL COMPANY

02:11:08.661 --> 02:11:12.164 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS APPROPRIATE

02:11:11.497 --> 02:11:14.166 region:rollup2
VERSES.

02:11:12.164 --> 02:11:15.234 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE PERHAPS THE BEST

02:11:14.166 --> 02:11:17.636 region:rollup2
PRACTICES?

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:20.306 region:rollup2
GIVEN YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU

02:11:17.636 --> 02:11:21.373 region:rollup2
KNOW THE AREA YOUR WORK AREA AND

02:11:20.306 --> 02:11:24.243 region:rollup2
LIKE STP --

02:11:21.373 --> 02:11:26.378 region:rollup2
SAN DIEGO CLEARLY DIFFERENT OF

02:11:24.243 --> 02:11:28.447 region:rollup2
VEGETATION AND SO FORTH HOW TO

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:31.283 region:rollup2
HOW WE VIEW DECIDED --

02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:32.518 region:rollup2
WHETHER A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:34.787 region:rollup2
OR HAVE YOU DECIDED IF YOU HAVE

02:11:32.518 --> 02:11:36.822 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS SUFFICIENT.

02:11:34.787 --> 02:11:38.557 region:rollup2
SO I THINK SOME OF THE THEMES OF

02:11:36.822 --> 02:11:40.392 region:rollup2
THE OF THE HEARING TODAY HAVE

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:41.594 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE

02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:42.962 region:rollup2
VIGILANT TO CHANGES IN THE

02:11:41.594 --> 02:11:44.296 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT AND RESPOND TO THAT

02:11:42.962 --> 02:11:45.731 region:rollup2
SO.

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:47.199 region:rollup2
I I CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S ENOUGH I

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:48.834 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

02:11:47.199 --> 02:11:50.369 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

02:11:48.834 --> 02:11:51.637 region:rollup2
THE ENVIRONMENT --

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:53.272 region:rollup2
IN THAT WE ARE OPERATING A

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:55.007 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:11:53.272 --> 02:11:56.642 region:rollup2
AND HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:58.544 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THAT IN THE

02:11:56.642 --> 02:12:01.514 region:rollup2
LAST QUESTION IS WHO SHOULD BE

02:11:58.544 --> 02:12:03.816 region:rollup2
MAKING THOSE DECISIONS.

02:12:01.514 --> 02:12:05.217 region:rollup2
SO A PGD SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL

02:12:03.816 --> 02:12:07.386 region:rollup2
THAT THE GOVERNOR IS MADE WITH

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:09.755 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO A PROP UP A PROGRAM

02:12:07.386 --> 02:12:12.291 region:rollup2

02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:13.826 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS THE UTILITIES WILDFIRE

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:15.728 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLANS --

AND INCORPORATES THAT AND IT

02:12:15.728 --> 02:12:19.999 region:rollup2
INTO THE TRANSPARENT OPEN

02:12:17.463 --> 02:12:21.700 region:rollup2
PROCESS AT THE CPC USES.

02:12:19.999 --> 02:12:23.269 region:rollup2
AT WE WE WITHOUT MECHANISM IS

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:24.470 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT MECHANISM FOR THIS FOR

02:12:23.269 --> 02:12:27.373 region:rollup2
THIS APPROACH NUMBER HALF THE

02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:28.874 region:rollup2
MIGRATORY BIRDS I THINK HA HA HA

WE SHARE THE OPINION THAT THESE

02:15:21.747 --> 02:15:25.551 region:rollup2
DISASTERS ARE AN INDICATION OF

02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:26.986 region:rollup2
THE NEW NORMAL THAT REQUIRES US

02:15:25.551 --> 02:15:29.722 region:rollup2

MY FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I

WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISASTER

02:16:07.259 --> 02:16:11.130 region:rollup2
RESPONSE WHICH IS PRIMARILY

02:16:09.128 --> 02:16:12.865 region:rollup2
INVOLVING HURRICANES.

02:16:11.130 --> 02:16:15.367 region:rollup2
OF THE TWENTY YEARS AGO FLORIDA

02:16:12.865 --> 02:16:17.236 region:rollup2

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:18.437 region:rollup2
ITS DISASTER RESPONSE.

02:16:17.236 --> 02:16:20.773 region:rollup2

TO BACK MAJOR HURRICANES WE

02:16:20.773 --> 02:16:24.043 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR

02:16:21.907 --> 02:16:25.811 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH.

02:16:24.043 --> 02:16:28.180 region:rollup2

WE LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:16:29.348 --> 02:16:32.184 region:rollup2
FOSTERING A CULTURE.

02:16:30.783 --> 02:16:34.420 region:rollup2
WHERE UTILITIES AND AGENCIES

02:16:32.184 --> 02:16:36.789 region:rollup2
DISCUSS WHAT WORKS AND ALSO?

02:16:34.420 --> 02:16:38.157 region:rollup2
WHAT DOESN'T WORK?

02:16:36.789 --> 02:16:39.692 region:rollup2
FLORIDA TURNED THE CORNER ON

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:55.674 region:rollup2
FIRE ZONES ARE PRINCIPALLY

02:21:55.173 --> 02:21:57.342 region:rollup2
AROUND THE SANTA MONICA

02:21:55.674 --> 02:21:58.777 region:rollup2
MOUNTAINS AND THE RIM OF THE SAN

02:21:57.342 --> 02:22:00.345 region:rollup2
FERNANDO VALLEY AS YOU SEE.

02:21:58.777 --> 02:22:01.546 region:rollup2
NOW THE ONLY PLEASE A CALPERS

02:22:00.345 --> 02:22:03.548 region:rollup2
REALLY IDENTIFIED IS SET UP ROOM

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:05.317 region:rollup2
THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND IN

02:22:03.548 --> 02:22:05.951 region:rollup2
YELLOW SHOWN AREAS AND WE BY

02:22:05.317 --> 02:22:07.753 region:rollup2
THIS HIGH WIND AREAS THAT WE'RE

02:22:05.951 --> 02:22:09.121 region:rollup2
CAN.

02:22:07.753 --> 02:22:10.455 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE THINK ABOUT YOU

02:22:09.121 --> 02:22:12.090 region:rollup2
KNOW THE DENSITY OF LOS ANGELES

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:13.625 region:rollup2
WELFARE RISK IS STILL VERY REAL

02:22:12.090 --> 02:22:16.061 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ELEVEN NUMBER OF RURAL

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:16.762 region:rollup2
AREAS EVEN WITHIN.

02:22:16.061 --> 02:22:18.363 region:rollup2
ITSELF WITHIN ITS FOREIGN

02:22:16.762 --> 02:22:19.731 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE SQUARE MILES.

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:21.800 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MAJOR FIRE SUCH AS THE

02:22:19.731 --> 02:22:22.401 region:rollup2
BEL AIR FIRE THE WORST FIRED HIS

02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:23.468 region:rollup2
TO THE CITY OVER FOUR HUNDRED

02:22:22.401 --> 02:22:26.071 region:rollup2
HOMES LOS.

02:22:23.468 --> 02:22:26.938 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE YES STATION FIRE --

02:22:26.071 --> 02:22:28.707 region:rollup2
THAT THE HIT SERIES THE NORTH

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:29.908 region:rollup2
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THE CREEK

02:22:28.707 --> 02:22:30.776 region:rollup2
FIRE LAST YEAR AND THE HUNGER TO

02:22:29.908 --> 02:22:32.677 region:rollup2
HUNT AREA.

02:22:30.776 --> 02:22:34.513 region:rollup2
THAN THE SKIRBALL FIRE RIGHT IN

02:22:32.677 --> 02:22:35.947 region:rollup2
THE MIDDLE OF LOS ANGELES HOW

02:22:34.513 --> 02:22:37.549 region:rollup2
RIGHT ABOVE BILL AIR AND THAT

02:22:35.947 --> 02:22:38.183 region:rollup2
THE IN NEENAH WI PUTTING.

02:22:37.549 --> 02:22:39.584 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SUBSTANTIAL REFORMS OF

02:22:38.183 --> 02:22:41.019 region:rollup2
PEOPLE AT RISK BECAUSE OF THE

02:22:39.584 --> 02:22:42.687 region:rollup2
DENSITY OF THE CITY SO.

02:22:41.019 --> 02:22:44.389 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T SEE THE THE

02:22:42.687 --> 02:22:45.490 region:rollup2
SPREAD OF THAT SOME OF THE I OR

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:47.292 region:rollup2
YOU SEE IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:48.760 region:rollup2
FACILITIES RECEIVED A LOT OF

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:50.996 region:rollup2
RISK WITHIN LOS ANGELES.

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:52.564 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WERE IN LA

02:22:50.996 --> 02:22:53.665 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING

02:22:52.564 --> 02:22:54.699 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO LIVE IT RELATED TO THE

02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:56.268 region:rollup2
LA FIRE.

02:22:54.699 --> 02:22:56.635 region:rollup2
TO WHO HAS A FIVE TO SEVEN

02:22:56.268 --> 02:22:59.070 region:rollup2
MINUTE NATURAL.

02:22:56.635 --> 02:23:00.172 region:rollup2
TIME TO MOST INCIDENT SO IT'S

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:01.540 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT THAN A RURAL

02:23:00.172 --> 02:23:02.674 region:rollup2
SETTING BUT NONE THE LESS THAT

02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:05.277 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF OF RISK THAT WE

02:23:02.674 --> 02:23:06.244 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF NEXT LIKE

02:23:05.277 --> 02:23:08.079 region:rollup2
TALKS ABOUT SUMMER CONSTRUCTION

02:23:06.244 --> 02:23:09.815 region:rollup2
STANDARDS WE'VE ADOPTED A NUMBER

02:23:08.079 --> 02:23:10.916 region:rollup2
OF STANDARDS FOR CONSTRUCTION

02:23:09.815 --> 02:23:12.884 region:rollup2
HIGHER FIRES OWNS.

02:23:10.916 --> 02:23:14.186 region:rollup2
AND HIGH WINDS OWNS NOT ONE OF

02:23:12.884 --> 02:23:15.287 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS GO TO

02:23:14.186 --> 02:23:17.122 region:rollup2
A LARGER HIGH --

02:23:15.287 --> 02:23:20.025 region:rollup2
HAVE YOUR CONDUCTORS IN THOSE

02:23:17.122 --> 02:23:20.659 region:rollup2
AREAS BROTHERS WAH COPPER OR

02:23:20.025 --> 02:23:21.793 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S ALUMINUM CONDUCTOR

02:23:20.659 --> 02:23:23.695 region:rollup2
STEEL -- WE

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:24.696 region:rollup2
HAVE HIGHER READINGS FOR WILL BE

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:26.531 region:rollup2
USED IN THOSE ZONES.

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:27.866 region:rollup2
WE ALSO CHANGE OUR SPEAK SING

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:29.034 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT'S NORMALLY --

02:23:27.866 --> 02:23:30.735 region:rollup2
CALLED FOR IN STATE STANDARDS TO

02:23:29.034 --> 02:23:31.803 region:rollup2
LAUNDER SPACING BETWEEN WIRES

02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:33.138 region:rollup2
AND THAT MEANS THAT WHEN THE

02:23:31.803 --> 02:23:34.739 region:rollup2
WIND BLOWS.

02:23:33.138 --> 02:23:35.740 region:rollup2
THAT IS IF THE WHAT CONDUCTORS

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:37.342 region:rollup2
MOVE IS LESS CHANCE OF THEY'LL

02:23:35.740 --> 02:23:37.976 region:rollup2
SLAP TOGETHER AND CREATE A FIRE

02:23:37.342 --> 02:23:38.743 region:rollup2
RISK IN SO THAT ALONE HAS A LOT

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:40.745 region:rollup2
--

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:42.581 region:rollup2
TO THE SEAT.

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:43.515 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE PRUDENT THINGS TO

02:23:42.581 --> 02:23:45.417 region:rollup2
COVER SOME OF THEBEAR

02:23:43.515 --> 02:23:47.419 region:rollup2
CONDUCTORS IN CERTAIN AREAS.

02:23:45.417 --> 02:23:47.986 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO A GREATER WIND

02:23:47.419 --> 02:23:50.455 region:rollup2
LOADING A CALIFORNIA NGUYEN

02:23:47.986 --> 02:23:51.890 region:rollup2
LOTUS LITTLE OVER FIFTY TO HAVE

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:52.791 region:rollup2
MILES OUR FOR FOR A DESIGN

02:23:51.890 --> 02:23:54.092 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

02:23:52.791 --> 02:23:55.193 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE USING EIGHTY MILES AN

02:23:54.092 --> 02:23:56.561 region:rollup2
HOURS ARE DESIGNED PURPOSE WHEN

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.863 region:rollup2
BOATS WERE LOOKING AT HIGH

02:23:56.561 --> 02:23:58.463 region:rollup2
CANYON WINS.

02:23:57.863 --> 02:23:59.998 region:rollup2
BUT BASS OF WE'VE WE'VE

02:23:58.463 --> 02:24:01.600 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENED OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:02.467 region:rollup2
IN THESE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE

02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:04.202 region:rollup2
ARE MOST PRONE TO HAVE TO FIRE

02:24:02.467 --> 02:24:05.770 region:rollup2
THREAT.

02:24:04.202 --> 02:24:07.172 region:rollup2
THE NEXT SLIDE TALKS WITHOUT THE

02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:08.373 region:rollup2
WHOLE ISSUE OF FUEL SOURCE

02:24:07.172 --> 02:24:09.941 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT WHICH IS A BIG ISSUE

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:12.177 region:rollup2
THE STATEWIDE.

02:24:09.941 --> 02:24:12.844 region:rollup2
WE BEGAN WITH OUR OF FIRE

02:24:12.177 --> 02:24:14.079 region:rollup2

THIS --

02:24:14.513 --> 02:24:17.649 region:rollup2
MEETS OR EXCEEDS ALL THE

STANDARDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN

02:24:17.649 --> 02:24:21.520 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE ISN'T EXPANDERS.

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:22.354 region:rollup2
THERE'S CPUC STANDARD YOUR ORDER

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.955 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE IS A CAL FIRE

02:24:22.354 --> 02:24:25.323 region:rollup2
STANDARD SO WE EXCEED ALL THOSE

02:24:23.955 --> 02:24:26.625 region:rollup2
EXISTING STANDARDS AND IF THE

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:28.159 region:rollup2
STATE DOES ELECTED CHANGER

02:24:26.625 --> 02:24:29.594 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENING STANDARDS WILL

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:30.729 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO MEET OR EXCEED THOSE

02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:31.663 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AS WELL.

02:24:30.729 --> 02:24:33.431 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A MAIN WE MAINTAIN A

02:24:31.663 --> 02:24:35.300 region:rollup2

02:24:33.431 --> 02:24:36.735 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TREES THAT SIXTEEN FROM

POLAND'S VALLEY ACTUALLY MODEL

02:24:36.735 --> 02:24:39.137 region:rollup2

02:24:38.103 --> 02:24:41.006 region:rollup2
BASIN.

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:42.374 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SAN PEDRO.

02:24:41.006 --> 02:24:44.342 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A YEAR ROUND TRAINING

02:24:42.374 --> 02:24:46.611 region:rollup2
CYCLE BETWEEN OUR OWN CREWS AND

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:48.713 region:rollup2
CONTRACT CREWS WHERE WE FOLLOW

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:50.182 region:rollup2
THIS MEASURE PRACTICES FROM THE

SOCIETY OF MUNICIPAL ARBORISTS

02:24:50.182 --> 02:24:53.385 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE WE TRIM TREES

02:24:51.216 --> 02:24:53.852 region:rollup2
PROPERLY ALONG THE ENTIRE RIGHT

02:24:53.385 --> 02:24:55.220 region:rollup2
OF WAYS FOR A FOR OUR

02:24:53.852 --> 02:24:57.756 region:rollup2
POWERLINES.

02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:58.290 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY TRIM ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:24:57.756 --> 02:24:59.624 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TREES

02:24:58.290 --> 02:25:00.258 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY IN SPENT ABOUT TWENTY

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:02.060 region:rollup2
TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR JUST

ON TREAT.

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:04.329 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE TREE TRIMMING AND

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:05.997 region:rollup2
THERE'S A QUESTION BEFORE ABOUT

02:25:04.329 --> 02:25:07.032 region:rollup2
WHO INSPECTS A TREE TRIMMING WE

02:25:05.997 --> 02:25:07.999 region:rollup2
HAVE CERTIFIED --

02:25:07.032 --> 02:25:10.135 region:rollup2
LINE CLEARANCE ARBORISTS ON

02:25:07.999 --> 02:25:12.270 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT INSPECT ALL THE WORK

02:25:10.135 --> 02:25:14.573 region:rollup2
BOTH BY OUR CREWS AND BY PRIVATE

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:16.107 region:rollup2
TO MAKE IT A HOT* CREWS. ONE

02:25:14.573 --> 02:25:17.375 region:rollup2
ISSUE WE DO SEE IS TREES AND

02:25:16.107 --> 02:25:19.010 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT ARE

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:20.912 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF OUR RIGHT AWAY.

02:25:19.010 --> 02:25:21.613 region:rollup2
THAT MAYBE HAVE GROWN LARGEST

02:25:20.912 --> 02:25:23.048 region:rollup2
CROWNS --

02:25:21.613 --> 02:25:25.617 region:rollup2
STATE SHE'D GIVEN THE WAY YEAR

02:25:23.048 --> 02:25:26.484 region:rollup2
WE HAD A COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT

02:25:25.617 --> 02:25:27.819 region:rollup2
HAVE BAD WE CAN ROOT OLD ROOTS.

02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:29.154 region:rollup2
AND SO THE POTENTIAL THOSE TO

02:25:27.819 --> 02:25:30.956 region:rollup2
FALL INTO OUR RIGHT AWAY IS AN

02:25:29.154 --> 02:25:32.457 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND LOOKING AT HOW WE GET

02:25:30.956 --> 02:25:33.825 region:rollup2
ON THE PRIVATE PROPERTY IS A

02:25:32.457 --> 02:25:34.459 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE FOR US IN SOMETHING

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:36.061 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS

02:25:34.459 --> 02:25:37.495 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:38.663 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR WHEN THE FOCUS LIMIT

02:25:37.495 --> 02:25:39.364 region:rollup2
ON OF WE'RE DOING FOR RESILIENCY

02:25:38.663 --> 02:25:40.732 region:rollup2
PLANNING.

02:25:39.364 --> 02:25:42.834 region:rollup2
A WE ARE IMPLEMENTING --

02:25:40.732 --> 02:25:44.436 region:rollup2
MORE SMART GRID TECHNOLOGY AND

02:25:42.834 --> 02:25:45.870 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTION AUTOMATION WE HAVE A

02:25:44.436 --> 02:25:47.205 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VISIBILITY OF

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:48.340 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM NOW BUT NO WE'RE

02:25:47.205 --> 02:25:50.342 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'D LIKE TO BE WE KNOW

02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:50.942 region:rollup2
THAT IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS WILL

02:25:50.342 --> 02:25:51.576 region:rollup2
HAVE MUCH GREATER CONTROL OVER

02:25:50.942 --> 02:25:53.545 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:25:51.576 --> 02:25:55.213 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE AUTOMATICALLY CLOSERS

02:25:53.545 --> 02:25:56.948 region:rollup2
ON A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ARTISTRY

02:25:55.213 --> 02:25:58.883 region:rollup2
XIN LINES BOMB BUT THOSE ARE

02:25:56.948 --> 02:26:00.518 region:rollup2
CLOSE OUR INSTITUTIONS.

02:25:58.883 --> 02:26:02.887 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO ARE RUDE EVALUATING

02:26:00.518 --> 02:26:05.223 region:rollup2
HOW OFTEN THOSE SHOULD BE USED

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:06.958 region:rollup2
BUT TYPICALLY ARE CLOSURES ACT

02:26:05.223 --> 02:26:07.592 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY ONE TIMES A WEEK.

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:09.594 region:rollup2
NONE OF THESE OF EVER CAUSE A

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:11.296 region:rollup2
FIRE BUT IF WE DID NOT HAVE A

02:26:09.594 --> 02:26:12.530 region:rollup2
MAC TO AUTOMATICALLY THE V.

02:26:11.296 --> 02:26:13.131 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE MORE POWER OUTAGES WE

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:14.599 region:rollup2
CAN THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS SET

02:26:13.131 --> 02:26:15.200 region:rollup2
UP.

02:26:14.599 --> 02:26:17.002 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES EASIER CLOSURES

02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:18.770 region:rollup2
HAPPEN ON THE VALLEY FLOOR SOME

02:26:17.002 --> 02:26:19.504 region:rollup2
THE CIRCUITS REGION OF THE HILLS

02:26:18.770 --> 02:26:21.506 region:rollup2
FULLY HAPPEN IN AREAS THAT ARE

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:22.707 region:rollup2
VERY DENSELY POPULATED AND SERVE

02:26:21.506 --> 02:26:24.109 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

02:26:22.707 --> 02:26:26.244 region:rollup2
BUT THEY DO NOT REALLY HOUSE IN

02:26:24.109 --> 02:26:27.912 region:rollup2
HIGH FIRE AREAS AND SO TRYING TO

02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:30.749 region:rollup2
SEPARATE OUT THE HIGH FAIR AREAS

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:31.483 region:rollup2
FROM OTHER RESTLESS DID ISSUES

02:26:30.749 --> 02:26:32.117 region:rollup2
S. MISS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

02:26:31.483 --> 02:26:33.518 region:rollup2
WORKING ON AND WOOD THAT WOULD

02:26:32.117 --> 02:26:34.886 region:rollup2
AIM TOWARD IN THE FUTURE.

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:36.221 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE NO AUTOMATIC CLOSES

02:26:34.886 --> 02:26:37.856 region:rollup2
ON TRANSMISSION LINES SO THE

02:26:36.221 --> 02:26:39.591 region:rollup2
LINES AT TRAVEL THROUGH THE

02:26:37.856 --> 02:26:41.459 region:rollup2
WILDERNESS DO THEY GO OFF THEY

02:26:39.591 --> 02:26:44.095 region:rollup2
GO OFTEN SO WE ALWAYS PATROL

02:26:41.459 --> 02:26:46.031 region:rollup2
THOSE ADDRESS THE OURSELVES.

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:46.798 region:rollup2
AND I'M GLAD I MEAN I'M SORRY IF

02:26:46.031 --> 02:26:48.266 region:rollup2
I COULD JUST INTERRUPT GETS A

02:26:46.798 --> 02:26:49.934 region:rollup2
SENATOR DODD HAD A QUESTION THEN

02:26:48.266 --> 02:26:51.002 region:rollup2
AFTER HE'S OUT HIS QUESTION IF

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:52.404 region:rollup2
YOU COULD JUST TAKE.

02:26:51.002 --> 02:26:54.039 region:rollup2
MAYBE THIRTY SECONDS READINESS

02:26:52.404 --> 02:26:54.939 region:rollup2
THAT'S FINE OKAY A SUBSITE YES

02:26:54.039 --> 02:26:57.809 region:rollup2
ARE YOU GOING TO POINT OUT THAT

02:26:54.939 --> 02:26:58.443 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF LASSIE --

02:26:57.809 --> 02:26:58.977 region:rollup2
WE ARE WE ARE WORKING AT TO LAST

02:26:58.443 --> 02:27:00.311 region:rollup2
POINT -- WE

02:26:58.977 --> 02:27:02.147 region:rollup2
DO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NEW

02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:03.181 region:rollup2
MATERIALS OF STEELPOLES ARE

02:27:02.147 --> 02:27:05.050 region:rollup2
MENTIONED NEVER TIMES TODAY

02:27:03.181 --> 02:27:05.917 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE USE OF STEEL POLES.

02:27:05.050 --> 02:27:07.419 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ISSUE THE STEEL POLES

02:27:05.917 --> 02:27:08.053 region:rollup2
AT THE OF STEEL POLES YOU HAVE

02:27:07.419 --> 02:27:09.421 region:rollup2
TO TURN THE POWER OFF TO WORK ON

02:27:08.053 --> 02:27:10.488 region:rollup2
THEM.

02:27:09.421 --> 02:27:12.023 region:rollup2
THE AND CERTAIN AGENCIES HAVE NO

02:27:10.488 --> 02:27:13.792 region:rollup2
PROBLEM TURN THE POWER OFF ON

02:27:12.023 --> 02:27:15.093 region:rollup2
THE CUSTOMERS TO DO THE WORK WE

02:27:13.792 --> 02:27:16.461 region:rollup2
HAVE A POLICY TWENTY CUSTOMERS

02:27:15.093 --> 02:27:17.796 region:rollup2
IN POWER WE WORK HIGH.

02:27:16.461 --> 02:27:19.464 region:rollup2
ON A LOT OF OUR LINES AS MUCH AS

02:27:17.796 --> 02:27:20.999 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE IN SO WE DO YOU STILL

02:27:19.464 --> 02:27:22.767 region:rollup2
POLLS WHERE WE THINK THERE'S A

02:27:20.999 --> 02:27:24.002 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR RISK WE DON'T USE IN

02:27:22.767 --> 02:27:25.236 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALLY BECAUSE A CUDDLE

02:27:24.002 --> 02:27:26.171 region:rollup2
BECAUSE GREATER POWER OUTAGES

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:27.539 region:rollup2
MORE FREQUENTLY AS WE TRY TO DO

02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:29.307 region:rollup2
OUR WORK.

02:27:27.539 --> 02:27:30.809 region:rollup2
WELL SO USING THINGS AS PALMER

02:27:29.307 --> 02:27:31.776 region:rollup2
INSULATORS AS OPPOSED TO

02:27:30.809 --> 02:27:33.812 region:rollup2
PORCELAIN.

02:27:31.776 --> 02:27:35.313 region:rollup2
AND ALSO FAR LESS ARMS THINGS

02:27:33.812 --> 02:27:36.247 region:rollup2
ARE MORE RESILIENT IN THE NEW

02:27:35.313 --> 02:27:37.716 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS WERE TESTING ONLY

02:27:36.247 --> 02:27:39.551 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS COME ON THE MARKET LOOK

02:27:37.716 --> 02:27:40.385 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROPER APPLICATION.

02:27:39.551 --> 02:27:41.619 region:rollup2
BUT WERE ALWAYS CAREFUL TO MAKE

02:27:40.385 --> 02:27:42.253 region:rollup2
SURE WE LOOKED AT THE BLOW THE

02:27:41.619 --> 02:27:43.621 region:rollup2
PLUS AND THE MINUS SIDES OF ANY

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:44.723 region:rollup2
OF THOSE.

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:45.890 region:rollup2
ON THE LAST COUNT I WANT TO MAKE

02:27:44.723 --> 02:27:48.293 region:rollup2
IT A MAYES BECAUSE THERE'S TO

02:27:45.890 --> 02:27:50.028 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT ABOUT RATES AND AND

02:27:48.293 --> 02:27:51.930 region:rollup2
EFFECTS OF ALL THIS BECAUSE I'M

02:27:50.028 --> 02:27:53.131 region:rollup2
OF FIRE PREVENTION.

02:27:51.930 --> 02:27:55.233 region:rollup2
FARK FIRE PROVISION OF FIRE

02:27:53.131 --> 02:27:56.534 region:rollup2
SAFETY AS WELL WORKER SAFETY

02:27:55.233 --> 02:27:57.702 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SAFETY IS ALL BAKED INTO

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:59.637 region:rollup2
THE RAKES AND A BIG THAT OUR

02:27:57.702 --> 02:28:01.239 region:rollup2
EXPECTATION FOR WOULD WHAT WE DO

02:27:59.637 --> 02:28:01.873 region:rollup2
IS PART OF OUR JOBS.

02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:02.674 region:rollup2
I WE HAVE A VERY SOLID CREDIT

02:28:01.873 --> 02:28:05.076 region:rollup2
RATING AGAIN WHAT WE'VE HAD

02:28:02.674 --> 02:28:06.444 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN FIRES IS NOT AFFECTED

02:28:05.076 --> 02:28:07.278 region:rollup2
THAT IT HAS AFFECTED OUR

02:28:06.444 --> 02:28:08.747 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COVERAGE.

02:28:07.278 --> 02:28:10.215 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD LESS COVERAGE FOR MORE

02:28:08.747 --> 02:28:11.583 region:rollup2
MONEY AND WE SEE CHALLENGES IN

02:28:10.215 --> 02:28:12.217 region:rollup2
GETTING EVERYTHING THAT CAME UP

02:28:11.583 --> 02:28:12.817 region:rollup2
EARLIER ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF

02:28:12.217 --> 02:28:14.819 region:rollup2
THE IN GOOD INSURANCE COVERAGE

02:28:12.817 --> 02:28:16.788 region:rollup2
--

02:28:14.819 --> 02:28:18.256 region:rollup2
BUT THE CERTAINLY A DISSIDENT

02:28:16.788 --> 02:28:19.791 region:rollup2
PART OF HOW WE OPERATE THE LAST

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:21.192 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS SO IS IT IS PART OF

02:28:19.791 --> 02:28:22.260 region:rollup2
OUR PLAN FOR HOW WE OPERATOR

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:23.428 region:rollup2
SYSTEM HOW WE BUILD OUR SYSTEM

02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:24.963 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE CHANGE OUR SYSTEM IN

02:28:23.428 --> 02:28:25.597 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE TO KEEP UP WITH

02:28:24.963 --> 02:28:27.398 region:rollup2
CURRENT WITH WHATEVER RISKS WERE

02:28:25.597 --> 02:28:29.834 region:rollup2
FACING.

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:30.869 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF YEAH BUT OKAY SO --

02:28:29.834 --> 02:28:32.704 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU HEAR ABOUT INVESTOR

02:28:30.869 --> 02:28:35.407 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITIES THAT IGNITING

02:28:32.704 --> 02:28:35.840 region:rollup2
FIRES YOU KNOW WE'VE WE SOUGHT

02:28:35.407 --> 02:28:37.408 region:rollup2
THE OUT.

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:38.676 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR --

02:28:37.408 --> 02:28:39.878 region:rollup2
DON'T HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT

02:28:38.676 --> 02:28:43.515 region:rollup2
MUNICIPAL --

02:28:39.878 --> 02:28:44.916 region:rollup2
UTILITIES OR DO YOU KNOW.

02:28:43.515 --> 02:28:47.085 region:rollup2
SO I I GUESS MY HERB PUBLICLY

02:28:44.916 --> 02:28:48.386 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITIES.

02:28:47.085 --> 02:28:50.622 region:rollup2
AT HOW MANY --

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:52.023 region:rollup2
IGNITIONS HAVE YOU HAD FROM YOUR

02:28:50.622 --> 02:28:53.691 region:rollup2
POWER SYSTEM WITHIN THE LAST TEN

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:56.127 region:rollup2
YEARS THAT THE ONLY ONE THAT I'M

02:28:53.691 --> 02:28:57.562 region:rollup2
AWARE OF IS THE POWERHOUSE FIRE

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:59.230 region:rollup2
DO SOME DEBATE ABOUT.

02:28:57.562 --> 02:29:00.765 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE CAUSE BUT THERE'S

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:01.366 region:rollup2
SOME BELIEVE THAT ONE OF OUR

02:29:00.765 --> 02:29:02.600 region:rollup2
WIRES WENT DOWN ON ONE OF OUR

02:29:01.366 --> 02:29:05.570 region:rollup2
POWER PLANT.

02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:06.704 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN THAT WAS RE POWERED

02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:08.440 region:rollup2
BUT NOT BY AND AUTOMATICALLY

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:10.074 region:rollup2
CLOSER AND THAT THAT MAY HAVE

02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:11.376 region:rollup2
IGNITED THE POWERHOUSE FIRE.

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.943 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME DEBATE ABOUT THAT

02:29:11.376 --> 02:29:12.877 region:rollup2
WE DETAIN INSURANCE CLAIM ON

02:29:11.943 --> 02:29:14.579 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:29:12.877 --> 02:29:16.247 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THEN THEN THE NEXT QUICK

02:29:14.579 --> 02:29:18.783 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE WE ARE MOVE OUT

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:20.852 region:rollup2
OF PUBLIC COMMENT QUICKLY --

02:29:18.783 --> 02:29:22.287 region:rollup2
IS WHEN THAT HAPPENED TO PAYS.

02:29:20.852 --> 02:29:23.688 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE PAID

02:29:22.287 --> 02:29:24.989 region:rollup2
INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE ARE

02:29:23.688 --> 02:29:26.558 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT ARE INSURANCE

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:27.192 region:rollup2
COVERAGE PAID?

02:29:26.558 --> 02:29:28.159 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION

02:29:27.192 --> 02:29:29.427 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ON THAT.

02:29:28.159 --> 02:29:30.695 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WE CAME BACK FOR

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:31.863 region:rollup2
INSURANCE NEXT YEAR INSURANCE

02:29:30.695 --> 02:29:32.730 region:rollup2
WENT UP FROM THE BLUE TWENTY

02:29:31.863 --> 02:29:33.965 region:rollup2
MILLIONS TO THE MID THIRTY

02:29:32.730 --> 02:29:35.433 region:rollup2
MILLIONS.

02:29:33.965 --> 02:29:37.101 region:rollup2
AND ARE COVERAGE REDUCED BY

02:29:35.433 --> 02:29:38.036 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE SEVENTY MILLION

02:29:37.101 --> 02:29:38.236 region:rollup2
DOLLARS OF WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO

02:29:38.036 --> 02:29:40.004 region:rollup2
US SO.

02:29:38.236 --> 02:29:41.005 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY.

02:29:40.004 --> 02:29:42.841 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SLIGHT COSTS

02:29:41.005 --> 02:29:44.175 region:rollup2
INCREASED THE RATE PAYER THERE'S

02:29:42.841 --> 02:29:46.911 region:rollup2
MORE RISK EXPOSURE TO THE RATE

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:51.015 region:rollup2
PAYERS [inaudible]

02:29:46.911 --> 02:29:53.518 region:rollup2
JUST [inaudible]

02:29:51.015 --> 02:29:54.452 region:rollup2
ALL OF WHEN THERE IS A FIRE

02:29:53.518 --> 02:29:56.754 region:rollup2
DISCOUNT FIRE COME AND

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:57.689 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE.

02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:59.424 region:rollup2
HE IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THE FIRE

02:29:57.689 --> 02:30:00.024 region:rollup2
IS SADDAM IF WE HAVE A FIRE SO

02:29:59.424 --> 02:30:01.292 region:rollup2
THE POWERHOUSE FIRE THEY JUST

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:02.694 region:rollup2
MENTION.

02:30:01.292 --> 02:30:03.995 region:rollup2
CORD ON THE ACTUALLY IN THE

02:30:02.694 --> 02:30:06.097 region:rollup2
ANGELES NATIONAL FORCE WAS

02:30:03.995 --> 02:30:07.131 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE CITY A POWER PLANTS

02:30:06.097 --> 02:30:09.033 region:rollup2
ALONG ARE ACCURATE COMMITTEE AND

02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:09.667 region:rollup2
SO HELLFIRE WOULD INVOLVE WITH

02:30:09.033 --> 02:30:10.401 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:12.303 region:rollup2
THE END WOULD HAVE DONE

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:14.205 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION TYPICAL FIRES THAT

02:30:12.303 --> 02:30:15.473 region:rollup2
WE MIGHT SEE AND THAT MAY AFFECT

02:30:14.205 --> 02:30:17.008 region:rollup2
US.

02:30:15.473 --> 02:30:18.376 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IN THE CITY AND SO LA

02:30:17.008 --> 02:30:21.579 region:rollup2
CITY FIRE WOULD YOU TAKE THE

02:30:18.376 --> 02:30:23.781 region:rollup2
LEAD ON THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

02:30:21.579 --> 02:30:25.216 region:rollup2
SCRUBBING THE FLOORS.

02:30:23.781 --> 02:30:27.018 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON --

02:30:25.216 --> 02:30:28.386 region:rollup2
DESPITE WAY THAT TILBURG IS ONE

02:30:27.018 --> 02:30:30.288 region:rollup2
OF THE SMALLEST APPEAR USE

02:30:28.386 --> 02:30:31.756 region:rollup2
PRETTY VIOS SOME PERCEPTION OF

02:30:30.288 --> 02:30:31.990 region:rollup2
IT -- WE ARE

02:30:31.756 --> 02:30:35.093 region:rollup2
SMALL --

02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:38.663 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY BUT OUR

02:30:35.093 --> 02:30:39.397 region:rollup2
AGENCY WHICH IS A COLLECTIVE OF

02:30:38.663 --> 02:30:40.732 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES

02:30:39.397 --> 02:30:41.966 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:30:40.732 --> 02:30:44.068 region:rollup2
AND SO WE DO SHARE A LOT OF

02:30:41.966 --> 02:30:44.702 region:rollup2
INFORMATION BETWEEN --

02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:45.970 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF ANTI QUE

02:30:44.702 --> 02:30:47.438 region:rollup2
--

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:48.573 region:rollup2
FOR HILLS FOR EXPLICITLY WE HAVE

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:50.208 region:rollup2
FOUR SQUARE MILES VERY SMALL

02:30:48.573 --> 02:30:52.176 region:rollup2
SERVER TERRITORY BUT SIXTY MILES

02:30:50.208 --> 02:30:53.278 region:rollup2
OF LINE WITHIN THAT SIR TOWARDS

02:30:52.176 --> 02:30:54.479 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY DANCE.

02:30:53.278 --> 02:30:56.180 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE OVERHEAD LINES THAT

02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:58.416 region:rollup2
RUN THROUGH ELEVATED AREAS OF

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:59.617 region:rollup2
FIRE RISK --

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:01.653 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH --

02:30:59.617 --> 02:31:03.388 region:rollup2
SMALL PEEL YOU WE HAVEA VERY

02:31:01.653 --> 02:31:04.689 region:rollup2
HIGH SYSTEM RELIABILITY SO WE

02:31:03.388 --> 02:31:06.524 region:rollup2
HAVE A VERY VERY LOW FREQUENCY

02:31:04.689 --> 02:31:08.726 region:rollup2
OF POWER OUTAGES AND THAT'S DO A

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:10.762 region:rollup2
LARGELY TO OUR MAINTENANCE SO.

02:31:08.726 --> 02:31:12.096 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO --

02:31:10.762 --> 02:31:14.132 region:rollup2
FOR MITIGATION --

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:15.800 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY WE TRIM OUR TREES SO WE

02:31:14.132 --> 02:31:16.701 region:rollup2
DON'T PICK SECTIONS AND SAY

02:31:15.800 --> 02:31:17.735 region:rollup2
EVERY THREE YEARS WE'RE GONNA

02:31:16.701 --> 02:31:18.970 region:rollup2
VISIT THAT SECTION BASED ON

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:20.371 region:rollup2
GROWTH WE LOOK AT OURS TIRE

02:31:18.970 --> 02:31:21.839 region:rollup2
SYSTEM EACH YEAR.

02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:23.875 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR TREE TRIMMING

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:25.610 region:rollup2
WE REQUIRE THE CLEARANCE FROM A

02:31:23.875 --> 02:31:26.678 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR TO BE A MINIMUM OF

02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:29.080 region:rollup2
FOUR FEET SO TYPICALLY THAT

02:31:26.678 --> 02:31:30.815 region:rollup2
MEANS THEY TAKE SOME FEET OF

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:31.950 region:rollup2
CLEARANCE FROM THE WIRES --

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:33.451 region:rollup2
THEY TAKE ADDITIONAL CLEARANCE

02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:35.620 region:rollup2
FOR WIRE SAS TO THE COMEDY WHAT

02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:36.254 region:rollup2
HAPPENS DURING HEAVY LOADING OR

02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:39.057 region:rollup2
HIGHER TEMPERATURES OF THE WIRE

02:31:36.254 --> 02:31:40.458 region:rollup2
--

02:31:39.057 --> 02:31:41.559 region:rollup2
WE DO WORK WITH PROPERTY OWNERS

02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:43.094 region:rollup2
HAVE REMOVE TREES THAT COULD

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:44.262 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY BLOW INTO THE LINES

02:31:43.094 --> 02:31:45.496 region:rollup2
FROM OUTSIDE THE RIGHT OF WAYS

02:31:44.262 --> 02:31:46.931 region:rollup2
ON THAT TAKE SOME WILLINGNESS TO

02:31:45.496 --> 02:31:48.066 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS BUT THAT'S A

02:31:46.931 --> 02:31:49.534 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN HAVE

02:31:48.066 --> 02:31:50.802 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY.

02:31:49.534 --> 02:31:51.970 region:rollup2
COME WITH THE TO PROACTIVELY RE

02:31:50.802 --> 02:31:54.272 region:rollup2
CONDUCTOR --

02:31:51.970 --> 02:31:55.273 region:rollup2
OUR LINES REBUILD AIRLINES SO WE

02:31:54.272 --> 02:31:56.708 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WE CONDUCTORS ARE

02:31:55.273 --> 02:31:57.909 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HAVE THE RISK OF

02:31:56.708 --> 02:31:59.344 region:rollup2
FALLING DOWN DURING HIGH WINDS.

02:31:57.909 --> 02:32:01.412 region:rollup2
WE CONDUCTED THOSE REBUILD THOSE

02:31:59.344 --> 02:32:02.580 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEIR END OF LIFE --

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:04.415 region:rollup2
WE ALSO LOOK AT SPACING

02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:05.583 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS SPREAD THOSE OUT

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:09.454 region:rollup2
THAT HELPS --

02:32:05.583 --> 02:32:10.288 region:rollup2
WITH THE FACE TO FACE --

02:32:09.454 --> 02:32:11.990 region:rollup2
CONTACT.

02:32:10.288 --> 02:32:13.958 region:rollup2
THEM WE ALSO LOOK AT WHAT WAS

02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:15.560 region:rollup2
MENTIONED BY THE REALLY PALE THE

02:32:13.958 --> 02:32:17.228 region:rollup2
CAO FIRES RECOMMENDATION FOR

02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:18.396 region:rollup2
SUBJECT POLLS OR OR CERTAIN

02:32:17.228 --> 02:32:19.397 region:rollup2
TYPES OF EQUIPMENT THAT

02:32:18.396 --> 02:32:21.065 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY SHOULD BE CHANGED

02:32:19.397 --> 02:32:22.834 region:rollup2
OUT FOR OTHER EQUIPMENT THAT ARE

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:24.802 region:rollup2
MORE COMPATIBLE WITH THE WILD

02:32:22.834 --> 02:32:26.704 region:rollup2
AND URBAN AREAS --

02:32:24.802 --> 02:32:28.940 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE DO VISUAL

02:32:26.704 --> 02:32:30.108 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS FOR GEO ONE SIXTY

02:32:28.940 --> 02:32:31.542 region:rollup2
FIVE WE DO THE DETAILS TAXES FOR

02:32:30.108 --> 02:32:32.377 region:rollup2
ONE PIC --

02:32:31.542 --> 02:32:34.912 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE WE REALLY LOOK AT THE

02:32:32.377 --> 02:32:35.413 region:rollup2
GEO NINETY FIVE STANDARDS ONE

02:32:34.912 --> 02:32:36.347 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE AS A MINIMUM

02:32:35.413 --> 02:32:37.582 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

02:32:36.347 --> 02:32:39.817 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOK TO EXCEED THOSE

02:32:37.582 --> 02:32:41.386 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN.

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:41.919 region:rollup2
COME AND WE ALSO CONSIDER BEST

02:32:41.386 --> 02:32:43.121 region:rollup2
PRACTICES OF THE FEATHER

02:32:41.919 --> 02:32:45.156 region:rollup2
UTILITIES SO.

02:32:43.121 --> 02:32:46.591 region:rollup2
FUTURE ACTIONS AND IN THIS FALLS

02:32:45.156 --> 02:32:47.825 region:rollup2
INTO THIS RANGE OF SHARING OF

02:32:46.591 --> 02:32:49.193 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE ARE LOOKING AT

02:32:47.825 --> 02:32:50.862 region:rollup2
REFLECT DAYS CUTTING OUT RE

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:51.496 region:rollup2
CLOSING --

02:32:50.862 --> 02:32:53.998 region:rollup2
TO AVOID THAT RISK AND WE DON'T

02:32:51.496 --> 02:32:55.433 region:rollup2
FEEL.

02:32:53.998 --> 02:32:56.801 region:rollup2
WE WE THINK WE CAN JUST CUT

02:32:55.433 --> 02:32:57.869 region:rollup2
THOSE OUT AND TAKE THE RISK OF

02:32:56.801 --> 02:33:00.805 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY HAVING SUSTAINED

02:32:57.869 --> 02:33:03.941 region:rollup2
OUTAGES --

02:33:00.805 --> 02:33:06.711 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT STAFFING --

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:08.680 region:rollup2
NO SONNY.

02:33:06.711 --> 02:33:10.281 region:rollup2
NO I I TURN MY PHONE OFF IN VERY

02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:12.684 region:rollup2
EARLY IN THIS CONFERENCE TO

02:33:10.281 --> 02:33:14.285 region:rollup2
AVOID THAT.

02:33:12.684 --> 02:33:15.520 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WANTS WANTS YOU TO WRAP

02:33:14.285 --> 02:33:17.488 region:rollup2
UP.

02:33:15.520 --> 02:33:18.356 region:rollup2
MAYBE THAT'S THAT'S THE MUSIC.

02:33:17.488 --> 02:33:21.926 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE MUSIC --

02:33:18.356 --> 02:33:22.894 region:rollup2
OKAY SO. FOR EXPEDIENCY --

02:33:21.926 --> 02:33:23.828 region:rollup2
SO WE DO LOOK AT THOSE WOULD

02:33:22.894 --> 02:33:25.697 region:rollup2
LOOK AT A STAFFING AND AGAIN YOU

02:33:23.828 --> 02:33:26.664 region:rollup2
KNOW LOOKING OLD BEST.

02:33:25.697 --> 02:33:28.433 region:rollup2
IS THAT ARE COMING FOR ITS OR

02:33:26.664 --> 02:33:30.068 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR TO BECAUSE

02:33:28.433 --> 02:33:31.469 region:rollup2
IT THIS IS A NEW NORMAL --

02:33:30.068 --> 02:33:33.438 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DO THE SAME OLE SAME

02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:34.005 region:rollup2
OLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A NEW

02:33:33.438 --> 02:33:36.240 region:rollup2
WAY TO OPERATE OR UTILITY IN

02:33:34.005 --> 02:33:37.308 region:rollup2
ADOPTING THE S. TECHNOLOGIES.

02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:39.110 region:rollup2
ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT

02:33:37.308 --> 02:33:41.579 region:rollup2
WHAT WORKS FOR LA WHAT WORKS FOR

02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:42.947 region:rollup2
PGD MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT FIT FOR

02:33:41.579 --> 02:33:44.449 region:rollup2
SMALL PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY.

02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:45.850 region:rollup2
I MEAN WITHIN FOUR SQUARE MILES

02:33:44.449 --> 02:33:47.285 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO FLY

02:33:45.850 --> 02:33:48.886 region:rollup2
DRONES AROUND OUR TOWN.

02:33:47.285 --> 02:33:50.455 region:rollup2
I THINK WE CAN SEND OUR GUYS

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:50.988 region:rollup2
HUMANS OUT THERE TO LOOK AT OUR

02:33:50.455 --> 02:33:51.789 region:rollup2
LINES AND I THINK THAT'S

02:33:50.988 --> 02:33:53.191 region:rollup2
PROBABLY OF THERE'S A BENEFIT

02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:54.625 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:33:53.191 --> 02:33:57.829 region:rollup2
BUT THE PUBLIC SEES HUMANS ON

02:33:54.625 --> 02:33:59.330 region:rollup2
THE GROUND WORKING --

02:33:57.829 --> 02:34:00.565 region:rollup2
LOVE TECHNOLOGY BUT IT'S IS

02:33:59.330 --> 02:34:03.000 region:rollup2
THERE IS A GOOD PLACE FOR AN

02:34:00.565 --> 02:34:03.735 region:rollup2
EXIT THERE'S ABOUT PLACE --

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:04.602 region:rollup2
FOR ONE THINGS UNIQUE ABOUT

02:34:03.735 --> 02:34:05.703 region:rollup2
HILLS BURGERS WE ARE BOTH THE

02:34:04.602 --> 02:34:07.071 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY AND WE

02:34:05.703 --> 02:34:08.606 region:rollup2
ARE A CUSTOMER OF THE INVESTOR

02:34:07.071 --> 02:34:09.807 region:rollup2
OWNED UTILITIES WE RECEIVE OUR

02:34:08.606 --> 02:34:10.775 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSIONS SERVICES FROM P.

02:34:09.807 --> 02:34:11.876 region:rollup2
GINNY SO WE'RE WORKING WITH PJ

02:34:10.775 --> 02:34:14.145 region:rollup2
NEED TO FIGURE OUT.

02:34:11.876 --> 02:34:15.213 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DE ENERGIZE OUR TOWN

02:34:14.145 --> 02:34:16.814 region:rollup2
THEY'D DE ENERGIZE OUR

02:34:15.213 --> 02:34:17.381 region:rollup2
TRANSMISSION SERVICE WHAT DOES

02:34:16.814 --> 02:34:18.449 region:rollup2
THAT MEAN TO THE REST OF OUR

02:34:17.381 --> 02:34:20.351 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY?

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:21.486 region:rollup2
SO WE LOSE ALL OF OUR PUBLIC

02:34:20.351 --> 02:34:22.787 region:rollup2
SAFETY FACILITIES WE LOSE ALL

02:34:21.486 --> 02:34:24.355 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC WATER.

02:34:22.787 --> 02:34:26.557 region:rollup2
WASTEWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS WE

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:28.760 region:rollup2
LOSE THE HOSPITAL HOW DO WE

02:34:26.557 --> 02:34:30.261 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE HOW

02:34:28.760 --> 02:34:31.796 region:rollup2
DO WE PROVIDE THAT PUBLIC

02:34:30.261 --> 02:34:33.397 region:rollup2
SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY.

02:34:31.796 --> 02:34:34.532 region:rollup2
DURING THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS AS

02:34:33.397 --> 02:34:36.501 region:rollup2
WELL AS LOOKING AT THE

02:34:34.532 --> 02:34:37.668 region:rollup2
CONTINGENCY OF PAY IF WE DID

02:34:36.501 --> 02:34:38.936 region:rollup2
HAVE A RED FLAG WARNING AND I

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:40.271 region:rollup2
DID WANT TO GET ITS CONDITION OF

02:34:38.936 --> 02:34:41.773 region:rollup2
DE ENERGIZING WHAT DOES THAT

02:34:40.271 --> 02:34:42.707 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO WE NOTICE

02:34:41.773 --> 02:34:44.575 region:rollup2
OUR CUSTOMERS THERE.

02:34:42.707 --> 02:34:45.943 region:rollup2
SO IT'S VERY UNIQUE BUT THAT THE

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:47.678 region:rollup2
BENEFIT IS --

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:48.813 region:rollup2
I'M THE UTILITY TRACTOR I'M OVER

02:34:47.678 --> 02:34:50.381 region:rollup2
THE WATER MORE THE WASTEWATER

02:34:48.813 --> 02:34:51.449 region:rollup2
I'M OVER ELECTRIC AND SO I CAN

02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:52.783 region:rollup2
WORK WITH THOSE GUYS TO SAY HEY

02:34:51.449 --> 02:34:54.185 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BUILD THE PLAN TO RUN

02:34:52.783 --> 02:34:55.553 region:rollup2
GENERATORS AROUND SO THAT.

02:34:54.185 --> 02:34:56.788 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SOLICITATIONS LOSE

02:34:55.553 --> 02:34:58.823 region:rollup2
POWER WE DON'T HAVE RAW SEWAGE

02:34:56.788 --> 02:34:59.924 region:rollup2
SPILLING INTO THE STREETS DURING

02:34:58.823 --> 02:35:00.958 region:rollup2
THE SO THAT?

02:34:59.924 --> 02:35:01.592 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUTAGES

02:35:00.958 --> 02:35:03.394 region:rollup2
UNDER TWELVE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:04.562 region:rollup2
DAY -- TWO

02:35:03.394 --> 02:35:05.196 region:rollup2
DAYS FIVE DAYS THAT'S A

02:35:04.562 --> 02:35:07.398 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE

02:35:05.196 --> 02:35:09.133 region:rollup2
--

02:35:07.398 --> 02:35:10.601 region:rollup2
IN ALL THOSE NUANCES HAVE TO BE

02:35:09.133 --> 02:35:12.303 region:rollup2
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT BECAUSE

02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:15.039 region:rollup2
THIS ONE SOLUTION MAY CREATE A

02:35:12.303 --> 02:35:16.474 region:rollup2
WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES --

02:35:15.039 --> 02:35:18.242 region:rollup2
BUT PUBLIC OWNS WORD WERE

02:35:16.474 --> 02:35:20.311 region:rollup2
SITUATED TO DO THOSE TO LOOK AT

02:35:18.242 --> 02:35:22.180 region:rollup2
THOSE SAYING SADDAM.

02:35:20.311 --> 02:35:23.781 region:rollup2
AGAIN LIKE SAID WORK CLOSELY

02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:24.348 region:rollup2
WITH FLEAS FIRE ON THE WHAT

02:35:23.781 --> 02:35:26.350 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO

02:35:24.348 --> 02:35:27.952 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC SIGNALS [inaudible]

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:30.688 region:rollup2
VERY.

02:35:27.952 --> 02:35:32.223 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT HOW THAT WORKS --

02:35:30.688 --> 02:35:33.624 region:rollup2
AND AND ALSO THE CITY PROVIDE

02:35:32.223 --> 02:35:34.725 region:rollup2
SHELTER FOR BOTH.

02:35:33.624 --> 02:35:36.494 region:rollup2
EVENTS THAT HAPPENED INSIDE THE

02:35:34.725 --> 02:35:38.262 region:rollup2
CITY AS WELL AS OUTSIDE THE CITY

02:35:36.494 --> 02:35:39.697 region:rollup2
AND SEWER LOOK AT THAT SITUATION

02:35:38.262 --> 02:35:41.399 region:rollup2
IS OKAY IF WE DO GET INTO THESE

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:42.900 region:rollup2
DINNERS AND ADVANCE.

02:35:41.399 --> 02:35:44.101 region:rollup2
WHAT STE TYPE OF SERVICES DO WE

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:44.969 region:rollup2
NEED TO PROVIDE IN OUR PREPARED

02:35:44.101 --> 02:35:46.637 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THOSE ITH AND

02:35:44.969 --> 02:35:47.638 region:rollup2
WITHOUT POWER?

02:35:46.637 --> 02:35:48.706 region:rollup2
SO --

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:53.077 region:rollup2
WITHOUT IT WOULD OPEN IT UP FOR

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:53.811 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS.

02:35:53.077 --> 02:35:57.615 region:rollup2
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF OUR

02:35:53.811 --> 02:35:58.883 region:rollup2
PANEL.

02:35:57.615 --> 02:36:01.219 region:rollup2
MISTER WOOD DISK A MINUTE I

02:35:58.883 --> 02:36:03.087 region:rollup2
SHASTA WHEN QUESTION THAT MISTER

PERMISSION TO DO --

02:36:07.425 --> 02:36:10.194 region:rollup2
YET HE STRUGGLES WITH OUR

02:36:08.559 --> 02:36:11.862 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT

02:36:10.194 --> 02:36:15.333 region:rollup2
MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO DO.

HAVE LANCE THROUGH FEDERAL LANDS

02:36:18.469 --> 02:36:21.606 region:rollup2
OUR STATE LANDS WE DON'T HAVE

02:36:20.037 --> 02:36:22.173 region:rollup2
THOSE CHANNELS IS WE'RE REALLY

02:36:21.606 --> 02:36:23.841 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH THE

02:36:22.173 --> 02:36:25.743 region:rollup2
PROPERTY OWNERS.

02:36:23.841 --> 02:36:27.111 region:rollup2
OF OUR IS USER MORE WITH FEDERAL

STATE AGENCIES AND WE WILL GET

02:36:28.713 --> 02:36:31.782 region:rollup2
PERMITS BUT IS A MONTHS LONG

PROCESS TO DO WHAT SHE HE KNEW

02:36:31.782 --> 02:36:34.819 region:rollup2
PRETTY CLEAR.

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:36.520 region:rollup2
AND AND I'D ECHO THAT THAT'S THE

02:36:34.819 --> 02:36:38.055 region:rollup2
U. S. FOR SERVICE AND WE COULD

02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:40.725 region:rollup2
USE SOME ASSISTANCE AND ARE.

02:36:38.055 --> 02:36:43.394 region:rollup2
EXPANDING RIGHT AWAY AND AND

02:36:40.725 --> 02:36:44.462 region:rollup2
FUEL LOADING IN AND FOR AND HE

02:36:43.394 --> 02:36:45.096 region:rollup2
WAS.
