GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND WELCOME TO AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT IS ON BEHALF OF BUDGETS OF FIVE THE PUBLIC SAFETY THE ASSEMBLY IS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE TODAY IS HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ACCESS ESPECIALLY FOR UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS WE KNOW THAT THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS BEEN A KEY ISSUE WE DISCUSSED BUT AS WE DISCUSS GRAMS IN WORKING BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE DID YOU BRANCH. THAT NOTION THAT JUSTICE IS AND SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK ALL OF US HERE THE REASON WE'RE HERE. HOLD THEIR DEAR TO OUR HEARTS BUT THE PRACTICAL REALITIES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE SYSTEM REALLY ARE ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THAT. SO WAR TRY TO LOOK AT TODAY'S IS COLLECT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE CAN. ABOUT WHAT THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY LOOKS AT WHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGE ARE UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS. THE THROUGH AND- THE COURTS AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES WHAT THEY STRUGGLE WITH WITH ENSURING THAT. THAT EVERYONE HAS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION HERE I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN. DIVE DEEPLY INTO IT POSE MUCH INFORMATION FROM A INCREDIBLE GROUP OF PANELISTS HERE. AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. AND LOOK AT BETTER WAYS THAT THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH OUR POP THE ARM AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET ARE. CAN ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE BEST ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR CALIFORNIANS CROSS. ECONOMICS BUT- ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE THE DIVERSITY THAT WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN CALIFORNIA. NOW THIS COMMITTEE IS ALSO LOOKED AT THAT DIVERSITY QUESTION ON THE BENCH AT THE BAR. AND THOSE LEADING IN AND THE NUMBER LAWYERS WHO THE LAWYERS ALL. WHAT ALL THOSE ARE ARE ARE A PART OF PARCEL TO THE BROADER QUESTION OF OUR- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT VARIOUS PIECES OF IT AS WE CAN. ALONG THE WAY ALWAYS% WITH AN EYE TO GIVING PEOPLE THE JUSTICE THAT THAT THEY SO DESERVE IN IN THE SYSTEMS THAT WE SET UP. SO LOGISTICALLY. I'M GONNA CALL UP PANELS I'M GONNA ASK TAT DID THAT EACH PANEL PRESENTS AND THEN OPEN IT UP. FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE DÃ­AS AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE WILL BE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THERE'S A PUBLIC COMMENT SIGN UP SHEET SO IF YOU WOULD PLEASE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT TO THIS YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO BUT LET US KNOW WHO YOU ARE. BY SIGNING UP AND THEN FOR THOSE WE ALSO HAVE LOTS OF PRESENTATIONS AND HAND OUT HERE. FOR TO HAVE HAND OUTS IF YOU HAD GOT WAS ALREADY. THESE WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE THINGS TRONIC WEIGHT SO THOSE OF US WHO ARE. TRYING DESPERATELY TO BE PAPERLESS HAVE ACCESS TO EVERYTHING WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS GET PUT UP. ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF. BOTH COMMITTEES THAT ACTUALLY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ANYBODY WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE OUTCOMES FOR THIS HEARING. SO WE TRY TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION. AS AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE AND I KNOW COLLECTING THINGS WITH THE EARLY WE CAN GET. ELECTRONIC COPIES AND GET THOSE OUT TO FOLKS THAT. THE EASIER THAT GOING TO BE. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO NOW TURN. TO THE COACH OF THIS HEARING. THAT IS WEBER. IS CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB. HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND WE AVE SOMEHOW WORKED IT OUT WHERE THE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY. MYSELF CHAIR OF JUDICIARY JOIN SHIRLEY WEBER AND TOM LACKEY AND OTHERS ON PUBLIC SAFETY. BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE DO HAVE A UNIQUE ABILITY TO LOOK ACROSS. POLICY AS WELL AS BUDGET QUESTIONS AS WE WRESTLE WITH THESE AND OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. FOR THAT FOR OUR COMMITTEES AND FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THAT UNIQUE LOOK LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HEARINGS TODAY AND I'M A TURNOVER FOR ANY OPENING STATEMENT YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE DOCTOR EVER. THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR A- THE CARING- THIS EVENT AND BASICALLY ORGANIZING IT ON ON BEHALF OF BOTH OF OUR COMMITTEES I APPRECIATE THAT- FREDERICK DOUGLAS ONCE SAID THAT WERE JUSTICE IS DENIED- WERE POVERTY IS ENFORCED AND WHERE. IGNORANCE PREVAILS AND WERE ANYONE CLASSES MADE TO FEEL THAT SOCIETY IS AN ORGANIZED CONSPIRACY TOOL PRESS ROB AND THE GRADE THEM. NEITHER PERSONS NOR PROPERTY WILL BE SAFE- THERE'S NO HIGHER STATE THEN THE PERSON MUST INTERACT WITH OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. SOME AND IT PERFECT THEM. WE'RE DO YOU DO CAN BE AT STAKE ARE PRETTY OUR FAMILY AND OUR PROPERTY. I THINK THE AS WE DID TALK ABOUT THAT SEE IN SERVICES THAT SUPPORT ACCESS TO JUSTICE HELP TO BRIDGE THE GAP SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET A- FAIR SHAKE. WHEN THEY DID IT WITH THE TRADITIONAL PROCESS. WHERE THE WISHES YOU COULD NOT MUCH OF THE WEB LOW INCOME. AND TOOK A HOUR BUS TO GET TO I. TO COURT WHETHER YOU ARE A WEALTHY IN CAME WITH ATTORNEYS THESE FACTS SHOULD HAVE NO. QUALITY OF YOUR IT. WE THE WHAT'S- IT WAS IT IN THE MOVIE JUST TO MERCY I MADE UP OF FOR READING THE BOOK IT'S SOME IT'S FOR TO HELP FOR KERRY OUR LIVES ARE WITH REGARD WHEN IT TO JEFF IF AT NOT HONEST IN AMPLE. OF THE PROCESS OF THE LAWS THAT ARE THERE SO- ARE BUDGET COMMITTEE WE'VE SUPPORTED A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS TO HELP ENHANCE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ALL CORD USES INCLUDING FUNDING SELF HELP CENTERS OF COUNTY LAW LIBRARY BUT IN COURT. REPORTERS IN FAMILY COURT IN EXPECTING LANGUAGE ACCESS AND SERVICES AND FUNDING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO PROMOTE GREATER EFFICIENCY WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS IN THIS BOOK BUT SESSION AS WELL SO ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER STONE IN THIS FOR PUTTING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE TO. AS I PUT THIS WE KNOW MORE FRIGHTENING BUT I'VE. GOING INTO COURT AND FOR UNPREPARED BEING ON A WAY OF THE- THIS TO TAKE. AND THAT YOU MAY KNOW GET A FEW SHAKE. I APPALLED AT THE HOW MANY PERSONS HAVE TO NAVIGATE THIS WORLD ALONE- BUT ALSO- SOMETIMES I'M IMPRESSED WITH THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE FOLKS HAVE ACQUIRED IT ON THEIR OWN. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO. AND I'VE EVEN AT PERSONS CALL ME BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT I HAD A BILL THAT WAS RELATED TO SOMETHING CORD TO REMIND MYSELF THE BILL FIVE A SIX OH. AND YET CALLING ME BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LIMIT THAT WITH REGARD TO THE LOVE ONE. RUN OUT OF RESOURCES THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND IT'S REALLY AMAZING HOW MUCH FOLKS HAPPEN. BASICALLY DO IT ALONE AND- THAT IN ITSELF IS VERY FRIGHTENING TO ME SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO I HAVE TO MAKE THIS THIS EXPERIENCE. OF A LOT EASIER. AND A LOT MORE CALM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DO IN A CASE WITH THE- THE COURT SYSTEM AB IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD. WE DON'T WANT ANYONE AFRAID GO TO. THE THEY'D FEEL AND- OR THEY FEEL THAT THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY OUT TO GET THEM AND OVERWHELMED. IS WHAT HAPPENS SO OFTEN AND THEN THEY DON'T SHOW UP AT ALL. SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS WITH A COULD WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA HAS. ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THAT WE SET THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THE NATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. Q. ANY. OTHER MEMBERS LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT THIS REST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I A AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND JUST MERCY I THINK DOES- TELLS A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT WHAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE REALLY MEANS I THINK THAT. KNOWING THAT WE HAVE ACTUAL JUSTICE AND TO SOMETHING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE DOCUMENTS WERE GIVEN TO US. IT ISN'T JUST A CONCEPT WE HAVE TO HAVE ACTUAL JUSTICE- THE THAT DOCUMENTS ALSO TALK ABOUT THIS ON GOING JUSTICE CRISIS. AND IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SO LONG- WE DO KNOW THE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ATTORNEYS I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERY ATTORNEY ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS SPENT LOTS OF TIME WITH THE LEGAL AID- BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN- GIVEN A LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW LOTS OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR AN ATTORNEY- BUT THEY HAVE AFTER SPENDING ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. AS A VOLUNTEER WITH OUR INLAND EMPIRE LOOKING LAWYERS LEGAL AID I RECOGNIZE HOW VALUABLE. THAT SERVICE IS TOWARD COMMITTEE AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO CONTINUE TO FUND. OUR LEGAL AIDS- I THINK SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST OUR LAW THE LIBRARIES WE KNOW OUR PROVIDING LOTS OF SERVICES. TO OUR COMMUNITIES- I'M SURPRISED THAT SEPARATE DEALS IS A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN WHAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED- IT THERE THERE ARE CERTAIN. POPULATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATE THAT HAVE A GREATER DIFFICULTY ACCESSING. LEGAL RESOURCES ARE ONE OF THOSE IS OUR TRIBES. OUR TRIBE TRIBES IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE PUT THROUGH THE PROCESS WHO ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR TRIBES RATHER. THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE I'VE THAT IS AN ISSUE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEING ADDRESSED IN EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY FIVE AND I'M PROUD TO BE THE AUTHOR OF THAT. ARE VICTIMS- IN THE ICE DETENTION CENTERS ALSO- DON'T HAVE GOOD REPRESENTATION WE DO KNOW THE STATISTICS ARE CLEAR. IF YOU DON'T HAVE LEAGUE PRISON. YOUR ANSWERS OF SIXTY MUCH. AT THIS TO JUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I HOPE THAT WE AS WILL BE TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND PROVIDING ACCESS. ADEQUATE TO JUSTICE- THAT WE MOVE TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT REALLY DOES LOOK LIKE JUSTICE FOR ALL. I THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS- VERY IMPORTANT HEARING TOGETHER. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS. THIS LACKEY YEAH I JUST REAL QUICKLY I. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I THINK WE ALL HAVE. LEARN FROM OUR HISTORY AND I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TRY TO KEEP A SENSE OF BALANCE I BELIEVE THAT JUSTICE SHOULD ACTUALLY. BE SYNONYMOUS WITH FAIRNESS. AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE OR GOAL. AND WE CAN'T BE ON. BLINDED COMPLETELY BY. FOCUSING ON ON THE OFFENDERS WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND ARE VICTIMS. AND WE NEED TO HAVE GO SEEK AFTER TRUTH. AND SEEK FOR FAIRNESS AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM. ALL THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM BETTER AND I DO BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN IN. THANK YOU. MISTER I JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO THANK THE TEACHERS IN THEIR TEENS FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND ALSO WANT TO THANK. ALL THE PRISONERS WERE BEING HERE. TO SHARE WITH US- YOUR YOUR- EXPERIENCES IN YOUR YOUR INFORMATION. ALL I WAS A LAW PRACTICE FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN YEARS AND I OVER THE YEARS I NOTICED A- HOW DIFFICULT IS I'VE RUNNING TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT THEMSELVES. AND I REALIZE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. AND IT'S A REALLY HELPS THE HOUSE SOME YOU KNOW A LAWYER REPRESENTING THEM SO. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. TO JUST BE VERY BRIEFLY AND I WASN'T ABLE TO HEAR THE PRIOR COMMENTS ARE PUSH I. APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING ANY CONTEXT BUT- LIKE ALL OF US I THINK WE ALL. BELIEVE IN IN. THE RIGHT TO JUSTICE. THROUGH REPRESENTATION- AND IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND RIVERS AGO BEFORE I JOINED THE LEGISLATURE. WE STYLISH OUR CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AS- AN ASPIRATIONAL CITY- THAT WOULD PROVIDE RIGHT TO CIVIL COUNCIL FOR EVERY LEAD TO GET- WHO- WAS ABOUT TO BE DEPRIVE. SOME SIGNIFICANT- TO PROCESS OR LIBERTY- IN THE CONTEXT OF EVICTIONS IMMIGRATION PROCEEDINGS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROCEEDINGS AND OTHERS. I AND- I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE IN AND OUT OF TODAY'S PROCEEDINGS BUT FOR. THE WITNESSES WHO COME UP IF THERE ARE PERSPECTIVES ON WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED TO DO. TO REALLY ACHIEVE THAT. COULD CALIFORNIA. BECOME THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO SAY. TO EVERY LOW INCOME LET AGAIN. YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN WHAT CONTEXT HOW WOULD WE DO THAT. LOVE SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THAT. ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER MEMBER OPENING STATEMENTS. ALL RIGHT THIS CALL UP THE FIRST PANEL. SO THE FIRST PANEL IS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA HEY WE HAVE HELEN HONG THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ACCESS INCLUDES AT THE STATE BAR. WE HAVE JUDGE JONI PRESIDENT PRESIDING FAMILY LAW JUDGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND LEAH SIMON WEISBERG DIRECTING ATTORNEY FOR THE SHELTER CLIENTS ADVOCATES PROGRAM. OF THE PART OF THE FICTION DEFENSE COLLABORATIVE. WELCOME. THANK. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS HELEN HONG AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF AXIS OF INCLUSION AT THE STATE BAR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY AND TO LAY SOME GROUNDWORK FOR YOUR CONVERSATION FOR THIS MORNING. THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR IS COMMITTED TO INCREASING ACCESS TO AN INCLUSION IN THE LEGAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WITH THAT WE ACTUALLY COMPLETED THE FIRST CALIFORNIA JUSTICE GAP STUDY JUST LAST MONTH AND I WILL PRESIDING THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THAT STUDY TODAY. LIST JUSTICE GAP STUDY ACTUALLY INCLUDED FOUR COMPONENTS THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS A FOUR THOUSAND PERSON. SURVEY OF CALIFORNIANS CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S NATIONAL OPINION RESEARCH CENTER. THEY ARE THE SAME INSTITUTION THAT CONDUCTED THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION NATIONAL LSE JUSTICE CAP STUDY A TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE CLOSELY MODELED OUR SURVEY WITH THE FEW VARIABLES FIRST WE FOCUSED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MAKING LESS THAN THIRTY TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR WITH A FAMILY OF FOUR. THAT IS CONSIDERED 125% OF POVERTY AND THAT MAKES THESE HOUSEHOLD ELIGIBLE FOR FREE LEGAL SERVICES THROUGH LEGAL AIDS SUPPORTED BY THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. SECONDLY WE OVER SAMPLE POPULATIONS THAT WORKS BETTER SPEAKING. RURAL AREAS SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. THOSE THAT SERVED IN THE MILITARY INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AS WELL AS LOOKING AT RURAL AREAS BY CENSUS TRACK. WHAT WE REALLY WANTED TO SEE IS WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS. THAT HAVE A CIVIL LEGAL REMEDY SO WE WEREN'T ASKING WHERE YOU A PLAINTIFF IN THE ACTION WERE YOU A DEFENDANT IN THE ACTION WE ASKED WERE YOU A VETERAN AND WHEN YOU WERE DESTROYED YOU WERE NOT ABLE TO GET YOUR JOB BACK. HAVE YOU BEEN HARASSED BY COLLECTION AGENCIES WERE YOU MISS BUILT FOR MEDICAL PROCEDURES THAT WERE COVERED BY YOUR INSURANCE. ARE YOU BEING- WERE YOU OF LOSING A HEALTH BASED ON FORECLOSURE. AND SO THESE WERE A BROAD GAMUT OF PROBLEMS THAT HAVE A CIVIL LEGAL REMEDIES OFTEN BEFORE THOSE FIRST SEVEN PAPERS GET TO YOUR DOOR. SO ALONG WITH THAT AT THE SAME TIME WE SURVEYED THE SIXTY NINE LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BETTER SUPPORTED BY THE STATE BAR TO UNDERSTAND WHO WERE COMING TO YOUR DOORS WHAT WERE THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY WERE FACING AND IN YOUR ESTIMATE HOW WELL WERE YOU ABLE TO RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS. ALONG WITH THAT WE INCLUDED KEY FINDINGS OF THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA'S RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS WERE PROVIDED THE CRUCIAL WORK. OF SERVING THOSE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT. THE PIPELINE INTO LEGAL AID LOOKS LIKE WE SURVEYED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE SOUTH TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LAW STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA. TO UNDERSTAND HOW LAW SCHOOL DEBT IMPACTS CAREER CHOICE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF A LOWER PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. TWO OF INFLUENCE OF FUTURE LEGAL AID CAREERS BUILT SPECIFICALLY PUBLIC INTEREST. SO THE KEY FINDINGS TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE IN THE ROOM MOST CALIFORNIA HELPFUL- EXPERIENCING ONCE A LEGAL ISSUE IN THE YEAR. FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES THAT'S THREE TIMES AS MANY PROBLEMS. FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE EXPERIENCE EIGHT TIMES AS MANY PROBLEMS. FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE AVERAGE IS FOUR POINT THREE WHEREAS FOR OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IT'S TWO POINT ONE SO THE EXPERIENCE MORE PROBLEMS AS THEY GO AS THEY- INDIVIDUALS HAVE LESS INCOME. NOW FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF INCOME HEALTH FINANCE AND EMPLOYMENT WERE THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF LEGAL PROBLEMS FAMILIES EXPERIENCED. SO THEY HAD MORE OF THOSE IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY. NOW REGARDLESS OF THE PROBLEMS THAT FAMILIES EXPERIENCE TO LESS THAN ONE IN THREE ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGHT LEGAL HELP. LIKE DR WEBER SAID MOST CALIFORNIANS WILL ASK FAMILY AND FRIENDS BEFORE THEY SEEK LEGAL HELP WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE- SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THEIR JUST THE KNOWLEDGE GAP NOT EVEN KNOWING TAT THE ISSUE MAY HAVE A CIVIL LEGAL REMEDY. OR THAT THEY NEED A LAWYER FOR THE LEGAL INFORMATION. SECONDLY BASED ON THE INTAKE CENSUS WE THINK THAT LEGAL AID CAN ONLY FULLY RESOLVED ONE THIRD OF ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT COME TO THEIR DOOR. BASED ON A LACK OF RESOURCES ALONG WITH STAFFING AND OTHER CHALLENGES ONE THIRD THEY CAN EVEN EVEN HELP AT ALL. ONE THIRD THE CAN PARTIALLY SERVE ABOUT ONE THIRD THEY CAN FULLY RESERVE SERVE. WE SEE THAT ONE THIRD OF LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS ARE LEAVING THE ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN TWO YEARS. FINANCIAL SALARIES ARE THE NUMBER ONE REASON FINANCIAL STRUCTURES. WHICH LEADS INTO THE BLAST FINDING WHICH IS 80% OF ALL AB A CALIFORNIA LAW STUDENTS ANTICIPATE GRADUATING WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF LAW SCHOOL DEBT. THAT'S A MEDIAN SO HALF WILL HAVE MORE THAN THAT AND HALF WILL HAVE LESS THAN THAT. MOVING INTO WHAT DOES THE JUSTICE GAP LOOK LIKE AT THE JUSTICE GAP AS WE DEFINE IT. ART WHAT ARE THE CIVIL LEGAL PROBLEMS THAT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING AND WHAT ARE THE RESOURCE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. THE LEFT FOR SHOWS THE GAP FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO QUALIFY FOR FREE LEGAL SERVICES AT ABOUT EIGHTY SIX PERCENT. WHAT I WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO NOTICE IS THAT THIS GAP PROCESS THAT IS HIGHER FOR EVEN INCOMES UP 23100% OF POVERTY. BUT IS ACTUALLY PROCESS REGARDLESS OF YOUR INCOME. IN TERMS OF. ACCESSING LEGAL SERVICES. NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE LEGAL PROBLEMS AND WE ASK THEM ALL WANTING TO SEEK LEGAL HELP IT GOES TO THE MANY QUESTIONS THAT- PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY OFFERED AMONG THIS COMMITTEE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LEGAL ISSUE. FOR MANY PROBLEMS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LEGAL ISSUE. LIKE DR WEBER SAID PEOPLE JUST ARE DEALING IT WITH ALL ON THEIR OWN. BUT HAD THEY KNON BELIEVE FULL RAMIFICATIONS THEY MAY HAVE BEHAVED DIFFERENTLY. THE ALSO THE ISSUES OF NOT KNOWING WHERE TO GO FEAR ABOUT COST IN FEAR ABOUT RETALIATION OR FEAR ABOUT LITIGATION IS ALSO. A FACTOR. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND IN TERMS OF. THE TYPES OF KEPT HELP CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING OFFLINE SO IN PERSON VERSUS ONLINE. IS A VARIETY OF SOURCES. PARTICULARLY ONLINE PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROCEDURE THE PROCESS THE RIGHTS JUST TRYING TO BASICALLY NAVIGATE WHAT ARE. THE POSSIBLE AVENUES THEY CAN TAKE IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT TYPES OF PROBLEMS CALIFORNIANS ARE ACTUALLY SEEKING LEGAL HELP AGAIN THIS IS ONLY THE ONE IN THREE THAT REALLY EVEN SEEKING LEGAL HELP AND THEN RECEIVING LEGAL HELP WE SEE A SLIGHT SHIFT IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIOR- THESE ARE CATEGORIES IN WHICH CALIFORNIANS WILL ACTUALLY STATE THESE PROBLEMS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL OR SEVERE IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES. CUSTODY FAMILY LAW HOMEOWNERSHIP. IMMIGRATION AND SO THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO NOT ONLY THINK LEGAL SERVICES BUT ALSO RECEIVE THEM BUT AT THE SAME TIME THESE ARE ALSO THE SAME CATEGORIES IN WHICH MOST PEOPLE THINK I NEED A LAWYER FOR THAT. SO THAT GOES THE KNOWLEDGE GAP. THE LAST MY LAST SLIDE IS BASED ON- WHAT ARE THE SOURCES OF HELP FOR CALIFORNIANS. YOU WILL SEE FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS NOT THE MOST I WOULD SAY. FOR CALIFORNIANS OVERALL A PAID ATTORNEY IS THE NUMBER ONE AVENUE HOWEVER. YOU DON'T KNOW THE AVERAGE COST OF THE HOURLY RATE FOR ATTORNEY CALIFORNIA IS THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR. IF WE LOOK AT FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF HELP IS LEGAL AID AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FLOODED WE SEE LEGAL AID WITH OTHER NONPROFITS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE THE COURTS. THEY MAKE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT FOR CALIFORNIANS OVERALL. SO FOR NEXT STEPS OF THE STATE BAR IS ACTUALLY CONDUCTING PHASE TWO OF THE JUSTICE GAP STUDY. TO ISSUE THE SURVEY IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES TO UNDERSTAND HOW A LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT CALIFORNIANS NAVIGATE THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND THE COURTS- WERE ALSO GETTING INPUT FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO JUSTICE LEGAL AID COMMISSION. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON THE REPORT ITSELF AT THE CHINA THE PERMISSION WITH ARE LEGALLY COMMUNITY AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE DATE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW CALIFORNIANS BEHAVE BASED ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROBLEMS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. YOU NEXT TO JOIN THANK YOU MY IS BILL MEAL ONE I AM THE SUPER JUDGE ALL FOUND IMPROVE HERE AT THE SACRAMENTO'S COURT IN FAMILY LAW WE HAVE NINE DEDICATED FAMILY LAW. JUDGES WHAT I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS TO YOU IS THE ROLE OF THE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN FAMILY LAW POSSIBLY 75% OF THE DID CONSENT WE SELL OFF OF REPRESENTATIVE. AND THAT MEANS THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IS ALSO INDIGENT. THAT'S A STAGGERING NUMBER WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ISSUES THAT WE ADJUDICATE EVERY DAY ON THE TREMENDOUS TROT TIME CONSTRAINTS OTHER THAN TROPICAL- FAMILY LITTLE COURTHOUSE IS THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. THEIR EXPERIENCE IT BY MIDDLE. INFLUENCES THE WAY THEY LOOK AND WE GOT AT THE LEGAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE JUDICATA FOR THEM MAY SEEM INSIGNIFICANT BUT FOR THEM IT'S LIFE ALTERING ITS LIFE AND DEATH. I WHEN WE ARE CONSIDERING THIS PARTICULAR CONTINGENT POPULATION WE GOT A LOOK AT WHEN THEY COME TO FAMILY LAW. THA THEY HAD COMING WITH THE EMOTIONS. WHICH IS WHAT MAKES FAMILIES ALSO DIFFICULT IS THE LOSS OF A RELATIONSHIP. IS THE DISAPPOINTMENT. IF THE CDVA. IS THE LOSS OF CONTROL THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE OVERRIDING FEAR THAT THEY HAVE IS OF LOS CONTROL A COMPOST BUILT THE PERSON TO SEE THINGS MY WAY THERE MUST BE A SOLUTION AN INTERVENTION. AND SO WHEN THEY REACHED THE IMPASSE THEY COME TO THE FAMILY LOCAL OF BELIEVING THAT THE WEAKER RESULTS SOME OF THEIR PROBLEMS. THEY NERVOUS THIS STRESS. AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THE COURTHOUSE BOOKS BUT THEY DO KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY CAN COME TO GET RELIEF SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE IF THE LAWS ARE ACTUALLY BRING TO THE COURTHOUSE. FOR RESOLUTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT HIS PROPERTY ISSUES. GEN THE TIME THAT THEY WERE TOGETHER THEIR MATH THIS PROPERTY. THEY HAVE THIS JOINT VENTURE THEY HAD THIS JOINT VISION THE BUSINESS THAT WE ACQUIRED TOGETHER THE HOUSE THAT WE PURCHASED. THE BUT THAT I SOLD MY HOUSE LITTLE OWN PEOPLE MANAGER THAT PUT THE MONEY INTO THE COMMUNITY HOUSE. WE GOT TO DECIDE AND DIVIDE UP THE PROPERTY DETERMINE HOW WITH FINAL PORTION RETIREMENT BENEFITS. DECIDED WE GOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO BANK ACCOUNTS THERE WAS THE FINANCIAL STUFF IN THE WITH THE OTHER SPOUSE THAT DEFERRED THAT FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT TO THE OTHER SPOUSE. NOW THAT WITHOUT SEPARATION SOMETHING IS TO DECIDE HOW TO EQUALIZE THAT ACCESS. CHILDREN THE CHILDREN OF EARLY OFTEN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO COME OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP I WHEN THEY CANNOT AGREE IT CREATES TREMENDOUS BE CONTENT TREMENDOUS CONCERN FOR THEY COME TO FAMILY COURT HOUSE TO RESOLVE THE IMPASSE BUT THEY'VE REACH THAT'S BECAUSE WHO GETS CUSTODY HOW OFTEN CAN I GET TO SEE MY CHILDREN UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DO I SEE MY CHILDREN WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SAY HAVE A SUPERVISED VISITATION. AND THEN THE DIFFICULT CASES THAT WE DEAL WITH BECAUSE WE ALL MOBILE SOCIETY WE MOVE ON I MARRY SOMEBODY WHO HAPPENS TO LIVE IN NEW YORK WE SHOULD CUSTODY BUT NOW I HVE TO I'M OFTEN TO BE RELOCATE THREE JUDGES IN FAMILY LAW AFTER JUDICATA RELOCATION CASES THAT FOREVER CHANGES THE DYNAMICS. OF THIS FAMILY. AND WHEN FAMILIES BREAK ALL POLL PARTNERS DISSOLVE THE RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE TO COLLECT WITH THEM AS WE HAVE THE FAMILY MEMBERS THE GRANDPARENTS AND THE RELATIVE BUT TYPICALLY GRANDPARENTS I USED TO BE INVOLVED IN MY CHILDREN AND MY GRANDCHILDREN FLIGHTS. WE MAY HAVE TO JOIN THOSE PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING. SO THESE OLDER THAN I WAS THAT WE ADDRESS IN TERMS OF CUSTOMER VISITATION BUT THEN AS THE FINANCIAL ASPECT. THEY SAY THAT FINANCIAL ISSUES CAN BE ONE OF THE DRIVING FORCES THAT SCHOOLS PARTY'S THE SEPARATE. BUT IS COMPOUNDED NOW BECAUSE NOW IF I HAVE ONE INCOME I HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHO PAYS CHILD SUPPORT. WHAT IS THE OBLIGATION BUT YOU HAVE TO WAS YOUR FORMER SPOUSE YOUR FORMAL PARTNER. I HAVE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO THE DREAM THAT WE HAD THAT I COULD BE THE HOMEMAKER UNTIL OUR CHILDREN GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL. THAT MAYBE WHAT PART IS OFTEN THE OTHER PARTY NOT TO GO TO WORK. SHOULD THAT BE IMPUTED INCOME. IS ONE PARTY ON THE PERFORMANCE ON ON IN THIS OF BIG. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE. TO TAKE. ESTIMATES POLICY. ON BEST MAYBE THE LAW. GOING THAT WE- WHEN THE PROTESTANT A NUMBER OF. AND IN THE TO MISTER BONUSES.ORDER MAKE IT THE TO. AS TO WHAT THE SHOULD EXCLUDED FROM THE HOW. SOMEBODY SHOULD BE RESTRAINED CON WITH THE- AND HOW LONG THAT RESTRAINING ORDER WILL LOST. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THESE DECISIONS ARE LIKE WALDRON TO THE FAMILY UNIT. I'M NOT JUST THE LITTLE DISRUPTION. I BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENTIAL NATURE OF THESE ISSUES IS BEEN FIT BUT IN FAMILY LAW. A JUDGE'S PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN ANY SORT. AND IT'S BECAUSE THE FAMILY LAW JUDGES VESTED WITH VAST DISCUSSION. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH YOU WOULD ASK YOURSELF WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO SELF REPRESENT. OBVIOUSLY THE OFFICE ON FIFTY THING TO BE REAL PROCEED COST- MY COLLEAGUE HAS SPOKEN AFTER THAT. AND THEN AS THE PERCEPTION THAT THE COURT WILL DO THE RIGHT THING A LAWYER WILL NOT. UNABLE TO AFFORD REPRESENTATION 65% OF OUR POPULATION OF THE 75% THE COME TO THE FAMILY LOCAL HOUSE INDIGENT SUBJECT TO BE WITH US. THAT COMPLICATED. IT MAY BE A GENERAL MISTRUST OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM. AND THEN WE ALSO CITE THIS TREND TOWARD SELF HELP. THERE'S ALWAYS A YOU TUBE VIDEO THAT COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW TO FILL OUT THE FORM. AND HOW YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF. I LOVE THE WAY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES OF ITS GUNS THE STATE I'M MY OWN BEST REPRESENTS TO. THAT BEING THE CASE. KNOWING THAT I HAVE STILL PURPOSE INTO THE GUNS ON THE SITE. OF WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE OF THE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. THEIR PRIME CONCERN IS THAT THEY BEHIND THEY WENT UP TO TELL THE STORY IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND IN THE ONLY. WITH THE DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGES THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE FIND OFTENTIMES WE HAVE TO CONTINUE HERE IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A- AN INTERPRETER THAT HAS THE RIGHT DOLICHYL THE RIGHT LANGUAGE. THE OFF THE THIS THE DIFFERENCES THAT MEANS I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN. THE WHAT THAT DAY IN COURT DATE WHICH THE IMPULSE. THE OPPOSITE MEN AND THEY ARE EXPECTED BUT WHEN THEY COME TO COURT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEUTRAL INDIVIDUAL WHOSE PRINCIPAL. AND WILL APPLY THE RULES CONSISTENTLY. THEY WANT TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT. THAT MEANS FROM THE MINUTE THEY COME THROUGH THE DOOR HOME SECURITY THAT TELLS THEM TO PUT THE- THE BAGGAGE IS ON THE ON THE CONVEYOR BELT. TO THE CLIENT THAT PROCESS THAT PEOPLE WORK TO THE JUDGE THAT HE HAS THE CASE. TREAT ME WITH RESPECT. THE ONE OF BILL THE SYSTEM IS BETTER THEM. AND THAT MEANS. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HELP OTHER PART TOO MUCH. I WANT YOU TO BE NEUTRAL. I JUST PAID THIS DOCUMENT PREPARED DOWN THE ROAD. TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HELP ME PUT MY PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER. AND NOW YOU'RE GIVEN THAT PERSON TOO MUCH HELP. THEY WANT TO LEAVE THAT COURT HEARING FEELING THAT THEY ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING COOL THAT THEY KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT. WHEN THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE THEY CALL IT HERE. SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE ORDERS THAT I MAY BE REDUCED TO WRITING. MAYBE I THINK TO THEM ON THE PHONE SO THAT THEY CAN PULL UP A DIGITAL FORM OF THE ORDERS THAT I MADE FOR THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE THEM TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO THAT THEY CAN PRODUCE THEM TO A FAMILY MEMBER THAT SAYS TO THEM. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. SO THEY NEED TO LEAD CORE WAS SIMPLE CLEAR ORDERS. THEY WON'T QUALITY PATIENT FEE. REPEATEDLY COMING INTO COURT GET THE MOTHER'S CONTINUES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE COURT INTERPRETED. GETTING OUT OF CONTINUE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHO TO SERVE GET THE MEDICS CONTINUES COME THE CRISIS THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES ON. PHILOSOPHY THANK YOU CAN GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE SHOULD THIS BE WHAT I KNOW MY TIME IS UP I DON'T HAVE TO THINK TIME UP SO I CONCLUDED MYSELF. THANK YOU THANK YOU JUDGE ALONE. THANK YOU. I KNOW WE ASK EVERYBODY TO DO VERY BRIEF PRESENTATIONS. AND AT AT OF RESPECT FOR THE LENGTH OF THE HEARING AND FOR EVERYONE I I'M HOPING FOLKS WILL. WILL STICK TO THAT. BUT I APPRECIATE THE PASSION AND- THE INFORMATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET INTO THIS RECORD AND IF THERE'S- OTHER THINGS AS WE FINISH THIS HEARING THAT DIDN'T GET COVERED. THEY ALWAYS WELCOME TO SUBMIT MATERIALS WE WILL PUT THEM UP AND MAKE THEM A PART OF THE RECORD. SO MS SEVEN WHISPER. WELCOME YES GOOD MORNING THANK YOU- I AM THE- DIRECTING I AM A DOCTORING ATTORNEY ATAFFECTION DEFENSE COLLABORATIVE ON THAT IS A NONPROFIT IN SAN FRANCISCO. THAT IS ADMINISTERING THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAM FOR SAN FRANCISCO. BEFORE THAT I WAS THE- IS MINISTERING THE A SIMILAR PROGRAM FOR THAT- ALAMEDA COUNTY. I BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I WANT FOLKS TO KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY THERE MY EXPERIENCES OF SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAD LOTS OF REPRESENTATION AND NOT SO MUCH. I AM HAVE ONE OF THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCES IN CALIFORNIA OF HAVING PRACTICE IN EIGHT DIFFERENT- COUNTIES AND THOSE ARE ACROSS THE STAT SO EVERYTHING FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SAN MATTEO AT SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY BUT ALSO FRESNO AND- MERCED. REPRESENTATION OF TENANTS- WHO ARE FACING EVICTION IS THE BIGGEST GAME CHANGER- AND I SAY THAT HAVING REPRESENTED FOLKS AND I AM ALSO- AN ELECTED RENT BOARD MEMBER OF THE BERKELEY RAMP BOARDS SO I AM VERY INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN WHEN YOU HAVE THE STRONGEST PROTECTIONS. AND HAVING PRACTICED IN FRESNO WHERE I ACTUALLY GREW UP- IT WHERE YOU MAY NOT HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS BUT HAVING AN ATTORNEY IS WHAT MAKES THE MOST DIFFERENCE. I'VE SEEN TIENEN SIGN AGREEMENTS WHERE THEY PAY BACK NOT ONLY THE RENT BUT- THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY'S FEES WHEN THE NOTICE THAT THEY WERE BEING AFFECTED WITH WAS ABSOLUTELY BASELESS AND I DON'T MEAN FACTUALLY I MEAN IT WAS A DEFECTIVE NOTICE. AND I'VE ALSO SEEN PEOPLE. AB SO ANYWAY I TO- SHARE WITH YOU ONE OF THE CASES THAT- HAS NEVER LEFT ME- THIS WAS A CASE HAT I A I REPRESENTED A FAMILY. IN LOS ANGELES- IN THE- AROUND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX- AND I THINK IT REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT REPRESENTATION AS- THE MOTHER OF THIS FAMILY HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE HUSBAND HAD MOLESTED THEIR YOUNGEST CHILD. SHE DID AN OUT AND AS SOON AS SHE KNEW THAT SHE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT SHE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED. THE POLICE SHE- REMOVE THE FAMILY TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTER SO THAT THE CHILDREN WOULD IMMEDIATELY BE SAFE. SHE MADE SURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN SCHOOL EVERY DAY EVEN THOUGH THE SHELTER WAS OVER AN HOUR AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOL SHE WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN SHE MAINTAINED HER JOB. SHE HAD APPEARED EVERY HEARING SHE'S REQUESTED SHE RESPONDED TO EVERY REQUEST MADE BY SOCIAL WORKERS MAKE SURE HER CHILDREN WERE IN SOCIAL WORK. SHE EVEN PAID THE RENT FOR AN APARTMENT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO STAND WHILE SHE WAS IN THE SHELTER. UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE'D EVER MAIL FOR RENT AND SUPPOSE THE ADDRESS SO THE NUMBER WRONG AND- RETURNED TO HER MAILBOX THAT SHE ALSO. WASN'T ACCESSING BECAUSE SHE WAS IN THE SHOP AND WITH NOT GOING BACK TO THE PROPER. SHE WHAT THE FINAL RETURN BECAUSE THE HUSBAND WAS. AND WAS IN. THREAT TO THE FAMILY. SHE RETURNED TO FOR. AT IN EFFECT NOTICE ON HER HER DOOR WITH AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER HAD BEEN FILED AND DISCOVERED THAT THE RENT WAS SITTING- IN HER MAILBOX. BUT SHE WENT TO THE LANDLORD WHO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE RENT AT THAT TIME. AND SHE SOUGHT LEGAL SERVICES AND WAS AN ABLE TO. SHE WENT. AND SO SHE HAD TO GO TO TRIAL BY HERSELF SHE HAD TO PREPARE ANSWER. BY HERSELF- ESSENTIALLY WAS BLANK SO REYES NO DEFENSES. AND SHE WENT TO TRIAL AND BASICALLY SAID PLEASE LET ME STATE THIS TERRIBLE THING HAPPENED- I CAN PAY MY RENT PLEASE LET ME STAY UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT A DEFENSE AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASE. SHE THEN LOST AND KAY AND THEN TRY AGAIN TO FIND LEGAL SERVICES AT THE TIME THAT SHE GOT THE ACTUAL VACATE NOTICE WHICH MEANT LIKE THE SHERIFF SO GONNA CALM AND THEY'RE GOING TO AFFECT YOU. AND AT THAT POINT LIKELY SHE CAME TO AN ORGANIZATION AND- I HAD AN OPENING THAT DAY AND I HAD THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING HER SHE TOLD ME ALL OF THESE YOU KNOW THIS VERY- YOU KNOW I GOT A STORY THAT. I DIDN'T HEAR OFTEN BUT YOU KNOW I'LL NEVER FORGET. AND I OPEN UP ALL HER PAPERWORK AND THE NOTICES DEFECTIVE THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A LAWYER TO PREPARE HER PAPERWORK. AND SHE HADN'T RAISE THAT I COULDN'T EVEN APPEAL BECAUSE IT HASN'T HADN'T BEEN RAISED- AT THE TRIAL. AND IT WASN'T IN THE ANSWER BUT WHAT I COULD DO WAS FILE HARDSHIP MOTION. AND WHICH I HAVE I'VE REPRESENTED OVER THOUSAND TENANTS- AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER. IN THOSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN I STARTED REPRESENTING TENANTS AND I HAVE FILED A THREE. AND BECAUSE THEY ARE SO DIFFICULT TO- OF- WE WERE ABLE TO DO AMAZING THINGS INCLUDING- WE DOOR NOT ALL OF THE TENANTS ALL TWENTY FIVE OF THE TENANTS SIGNED DECLARATIONS SAYING THAT SHE WAS A GOOD NEIGHBOR. AND THAT SHE WAS PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND THEY WANTED HER TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK. WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT JUST TURNING TO SIGN A DECLARATION SAYING HOW. ON HOW HARD SHE HAD WORK TO PROTECT FAMILY AND- ATTACKED THE VICTIMS OF A CRIME. IN THE PROCESS OF ADMINISTERING BUT JUST AS. AT THE MOTION GRANT. THIS IS THE CASE THAT NAY SHOULD HAVE YOU GOTTEN TO THE POINT BUT I WILL NEVER BE LOST ON ME WHEN THE MOTHER SAID WHY IS IT MY HUSBAND HAD A PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND I COULDN'T GET A LAWYER. AND I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT EXCEPT I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN CHANGE REDDING CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE WILL YOU KNOW THAT IN THE FUTURE MOTHERS WILL ALWAYS HAVE- THOSE PROTECTIONS AND THAT REPRESENTATION. THANK YOU WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION SEVEN WAYS BERGMAN THAT CAN ASK THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO ARE WE BETTER OFF FUNDING LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEYS WERE SELF HELP CENTERS. AND WHY FEW ONE OR THE OTHER NOT THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO NECESSARILY DO THAT BUT- JUST TO HELP. TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD SAY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE. ALL OF THEM BUT I THINK THAT THE GAME CHANGER IS THAT REPRESENTATION I MEAN. I KNOW FOR MYSELF- YOU KNOW WHEN I DID A WILL I DIDN'T DO IT MYSELF AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AND I THINK THAT- IT IT IS THAT REPRESENTATION. AND WE SEE THE- YOU KNOW WITH PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND STATES WHERE THERE ARE NO ATTORNEYS I MEAN THE WHOLE SYSTEM FALLS APART BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. IF YOU DON'T HAVE. EVERY PART OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM PRESENT IT CAN'T FUNCTION IT'S LIKE HAVE TRYING TO DRIVE A CAR WITH ONLY THREE WHEELS. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN YOU KNOW. IN PLACE I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO POINT OUT SOME PARTS OF OUR STATE THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN STEREOTYPES ABOUT BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST PLACES WHERE TENANTS. VERY VISIBLE OR THAT THEY HAVE TO DRIVE THREE HOURS- TO ACCESS SERVICES BECAUSE WE ARE SERVICES ARE SO LIMITED. AND THE WAY THEY'RE TREATED AND THE CONDITIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE UNDER REALLY- I JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE REMINDS ME OF THE GREAT. STARTED TAKING PICTURES OF HOW PEOPLE REAL AND FOR THE FIRST TIME. AT THE YOU KNOW WE PASSED A WRITER HOUSING YOU KNOW AFTER THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND WE ADDRESS THAT WE ARE RETURN TO THAT WAY I HAVE BEEN IN CLIENTS HOMES THAT. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE THAT WAY BUT THEY CAN'T FIGHT THEIR LANDLORDS BECAUSE THEY THERE'S- A LAW. TO DO THAT AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO NOW THIS. AT TRIAL SOME AND LAW. SEE BECAUSE THEY BOTH CLIENTS THOSE TEN ONE. GET HELP OR A- AND NO KNOWS I MEAN PART OF IS ALSO. KEEPING THE SYSTEM HONEST BECAUSE SO MANY CASES ARE SETTLED SO THE JUDGE IS NOT EVEN SEEN KIND OF HOW THESE THINGS ARE PLAYING OUT THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE NOTICE THEY JUST HAVE TO PEOPLE THAT COME AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS OF NEGOTIATING IN THE HALLWAY. AND THEY JUST SIGN OFF AND THEY GET CREDIT FOR NOT HAVING A THOUSAND CASES GO TO TRIAL NOT DID EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE WAS A TRUST AND JUDGES AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THE OTHER LAWYER AT LEAST IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT SOME YEAH THEY CAN'T. PART OF IT OUR SYSTEM IS AN ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM WHICH PRESUMES THAT BOTH SIDES ARE REPRESENTED AND REPRESENT A COMPETENTLY THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT IS WHY WE HAVE THE STATE BAR AS WELL WE HAVE LICENSING AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT. AND YET BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE INCREASED AND WE ARE ALLOWING SELF HELP. CENTERS ARE. THE STATE SHE SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE GET INTO COURT AND HAVE ACCESS TO IT SO I THINK THAT'S A- IT'S A TOUGH SUBSTITUTE AND THOSE WERE THOSE CENTERS DO AN AMAZING JOB OF HELPING PEOPLE TRYING TO PREPARE THEM. SO JUDGE WARNING THAT. WE KNOW THAT UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN FAMILY LAW IS STE THE SINGLE BIGGEST. THAT THAT WE FIND THEM DO YOU OR HOW DO YOU HANDLE IT IF YOU HAVE ONE PARTY THIS REPRESENTED ONE PARTY THAT'S NOT REPRESENTED. WHAT DOES THE COMMON COMPLAINT THAT WE GET FROM ATTORNEYS IS THAT THEY THINK THE JUDGES BEEN TOO MUCH OF AN ADVOCATE OR TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD TOO MUCH FOR THE PROPUBLICA. BUT THERE ARE SOME PROCEDURAL. MINE FIFTH PEOPLE OF THE PROPOSED. WILL FALL INTO. I THINK I'M ALSO CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MOVING THE CASE ALONG. AND SO IT. ALTHOUGH MY ATTORNEY ME PROTESTS LOUDLY I WAS PROBABLY HELP THAT PROPOSED IT AGAIN. THANKFULLY NOW WE ALSO HAVE THE SELF HELP CLINIC OR THE SELF HELP CENTER IS THAT WE COOPER THEM DOWNSTAIRS TO. HOW WHEN I SAY DOES THIS NOT BUSINESS DOWNSTAIRS RIGHT RIGHT. BUT THEN. KIND OF CASE POINT. IN SOME WAYS THEY NEED TO BE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW HOW TO SO THAT'S KIND OF A TOUGH. BUYING THAT. THE JUDGE OR IN BECAUSE YOU ARE OBLIGATED TO MOVE THE CASE ALONG. YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND. A FAIR VENUE BUT WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE AN ADVOCATE IN A SYSTEM THAT EXPECTS THAT ADVOCATE. AND SOMEONE DOES. THAT ALMOST EXACERBATES THE IT DOES EXACTLY. DOES THE TENSION. IS THE TENSION BETWEEN WANTED TO DO HELP. ONCE MOVE YOUR CASE ALONG AND ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES BUT YOU HAVE TO BE MUTUAL OR TO BE PERCEIVED TO BE NEUTRAL SO THAT THE OTHER SIDE THAT IS REPRESENTED IN. THE FIVE THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR RETAIN THE THINGS I PAY FOR AN ATTORNEY AND THE JUDGE IS HELPING THE OTHER THOUGHT. EVER SYSTEM. IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FAIRNESS AND I THINK THAT'S WHY IN FAMILY LAW IN PARTICULAR THE JUDGE IS NOT A POTTED PLANT THE JUDGE IS MEANT TO BE ACTIVE IN THE CASE ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAVE CHILDREN INVOLVED THE FACT THAT ONE PARTY HAS REPRESENTATION DOESN'T MEAN THAT I SHOULD OVERLOOKED THE PROCEDURE DEFICITS ON THE REPRESENTATIVE JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE HAS MANAGED TO GAIN A PROCEDURAL BONTA. YEAH RIGHTS OF A SONG LOADED QUESTION BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS FOR A LONG TIME HOW DO WE GET A TURN IN THE BAR TO PARTICIPATE MORE IN FUNDING WILL. SO I THE THAT WE'VE MAY. FAST IMPROVE. THE MIX OF FUNDING FOR LEGAL AID FROM THE STATE BAR IS INTEREST ON I LAWYER TRUST ACCOUNTS. WHICH THE STATE BAR CERTIFIES FOR THEIR INTEREST BASED ON A TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN LEGISLATIVE BILL. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO PAY COMPATIBLE INTEREST ALL THESE ACCOUNTS. OF THAT THE OFFER TO OTHER CUSTOMERS AND SO THE STATE BAR HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVELY NEGOTIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND WHAT YOU'VE SEEN AS A FOR HOW PERCENT INCREASE. AND I'LL TO DISTRIBUTE. A TWENTY TWENTY WILL BE JUST. IT'S A FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN AYE OLD TO OF REVENUE- ALONE- FOR LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING- THE JUSTICE GAP FUNDS THAT ARE IN THE LICENSING FEES AND OTHER DONATIONS. AND SO I THINK WE'VE MADE AN INCREDIBLE OF. A GAINES- FROM FOUR YEARS AGO WHERE THE DISTRIBUTION WAS I THINK ABOUT FORTY MILLION. TEN AND WE KEEP TRYING TO. FOR INSTANCE THE SPECIALLY SINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS BACKED OFF ON SOME OF ITS OBLIGATIONS LEGAL SERVICES. WE'VE BEEN FEELING THE OBLIGATION O STEP UP I THINK EVERYBODY NEEDS TO PARTICIPATE- QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL. THIS JUST WHERE IT MAY BE JUST THE GENERAL WHEN I AND I AND I'M HEARING YOU. TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF IT OF I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. WE ALWAYS HAVE A DISAGREED GETTING THAT THE DATA OF I DEAL. WITH A CONSTITUENCY DOES MOSTLY IMMIGRANT- HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FORMING INCARCERATED THAT MAY NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO COURT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OR ANY REASON- HAVE YOU LOOK AT. HOW DO YOU GET. INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO MAY BE REYES. OR WHETHER OR SYSTEM HAS NOT ALWAYS FRIENDLYTO THEM BUT THEY NEED. LEGAL AID THEY NEED HELP AND THEY MAY NOT SHOW UP. BECAUSE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DO YOU TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION AS TO HOW DO YOU. YOU KNOW YOU TRY TO GET THIS THIS MONEY IN BUT HOW DO YOU REACH OUT IS THAT SOMETHING FOR ANOTHER PANEL. TO KIND OF DISCUSS. IF I MAY I THINK IT CONNECTS TO MULTIPLE AREAS ONE IS JUST HAVING THE INFORMATION OF WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GO TO COURT WHAT HAPPENS- THE DATA SHOWS THAT MORE PEOPLE MORE PEOPLE ARE FEARFUL ABOUT. UP ACTION ACTUALLY WHEN IT COMES TO VETERANS ISSUES EMPLOYMENT IN FAMILY LAW- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S NECESSARILY THE GOVERNMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE OPPOSING PARTY AT TIMES. AND HOW THAT MAY INFLUENCE WERE LOOKING INTO THAT LITTLE BIT MORE- I THINK IN TERMS OF- THE FEAR FACTOR. THAT'S REAL A AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON. WHERE YOU'RE OUT WHAT YOUR STATUS IS WHAT LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK. TO FORMER LEGALLY LAWYER AND WE WOULD GET RIGHT ALL THE TIME TO COME TO COURT WE'RE GONNA DEPART YOUR CLIENT. ONE ON ONE AND THAT'S THE OUT REACH THAT MANY LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS DO AS WELL AS A SELF HELP COURTS AND- THE- NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING WITH THESE CLIENTS. A LOT OF LEGAL AID WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE THOSE INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIPS WORKING WITH- BARBER POPULATIONS LIKE THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND SO- I THINK ALL THAT IS BASED ON HAVING. ACCURATE INFORMATION. BUILDING THAT TRUST AND- SUPPORTING THOSE CLIENTS IN THEIR OWN- PROBLEM AT THIS. THEY RIGHT OTHER QUICK SO THE SPELL ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE'VE MADE THE CASE FOR THE THAT NEED HERE PANEL TO IT'S GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT EXISTING PROGRAMS TO HELP ON REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WE HAVE FUNNY HUFF PRINCIPLE MANAGING ATTORNEY CENTER FOR FAMILIES CHILDREN THE COURT. WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA AND BERNARDO WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY TULARE COUNTY PUBLIC LIFE LAW LIBRARY AND PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA LIBRARY SERVICES BOARD. WELCOME. YEAH OKAY LET'S GO AHEAD AND CHECK THE CAR. THIS IS SUCH A GREAT FOR FIVE LOVE. SOMEHOW FIND. OKAY THANK YOU. AT A GOOD MORNING I'M MORE HOW FIVE HAD THE ONLY OF FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL FOR TWO YEARS ON SELF HELP AND LEGAL SERVICES ISSUES AND- IN THAT TIME I'VE SEEN THE CUT COURT BECOME PART OF THE CONTINUING THE LEGAL SERVICES WHERE YOU SEE. BETWEEN TEN AND SIXTEEN I'M SORRY I GOT IDEA WAS LOOKING I THINK BUT- LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO COURT. BUT A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO GET LEGAL ASSISTANCE NOW ARE GETTING IT FROM COURT SELF HELP CENTERS AND THAT'S A HUGE SHIFT RIGHT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. SO WE STARTED WITH- FAMILY LAW WE START WITH THE FAMILY LOVE FACILITATOR PROGRAM WHERE WE HIRED EXPERIENCE TOURNEY'S TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PREPARE THE PLEADINGS- UNDERSTAND. HOW TO CAL STATE GUIDELINES AND PREPARE FOR COURT AND THEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED IN COURT. AND WHAT THE EXPERTS DO NEXT A WEAPON STEPS WERE. WE'VE IT THE WAS MORE MISTER FOR THE PAY. AND IT WAS ENORMOUSLY HEALTH FOR THE COURT. THAT COURTS HAD THE- THAT THEY NEEDED TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE FACTS AND LAW. AND WHAT WE FOUND IN FAMILY LAW IS THAT MOST OF THE CASES BOTH SIDES ARE AND REPRESENTED I THINK YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THIS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING ISSUE WITH UNBALANCED REPRESENTATION. BUT TE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES ARE AND REPRESENT. AND SO- CURRENTLY AS WE SEE YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND 90% OF LITIGANTS IN FAMILY LAW CASES ARE IDENTIFIED AS NOT HAVING ATTORNEYS. BUT IN REVIEWING CASE FILES IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ASSISTANCE IF YOU'RE READING THE PLEADINGS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENTS. THEY ARE THEY'RE GETTING ASSISTANCE AND THEIR ME THROUGH THEIR CASES BECAUSE FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO JUST NEED SOME HELP WITH THE PAPERWORK WITH THE PAST. IF HELPING SOMEBODY LISTEN TO THEM. MISSION OF AUTHORITY WHO'S AT THE COURT WHO CARES- AND SO THAT HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE SO LET ME GIVE YOU SEE OUR- WE'VE GOT NOW FOR US SINCE THAT VERY SMALL BEGINNING WE NOW THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND NEARLY A MILLION- CUSTOMER ENCOUNTERS A PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL ABOUT CORPORATE SELF HELP CENTERS IS WE NOT JUST DEALING WITH THE LOWEST OF LOW INCOME FOLKS WE ARE ABLE TO SERVE PEOPLE AS A WHOLE IN PLACE WE HAVE THIS HUGE POPULATION OF MODEST MEET PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE NO ACCESS WITHOUT LIVE BAIT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MAKING THREE TEN DOLLARS WEEK. TECH ELIGIBLE FROM. NOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND NOW IS BEING ME. OF SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL BENEFITS OF HAVING MORE SERVICES FOR CORPORATE SELF HELP CENTER SEC- SO I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A OF A WOMAN WHO COMES IN WHO NEEDS TO GET A DIVORCE. AND SHE MAY BE MAKING. FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH ON MY GOSH ARE FOUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN DOLLARS A WEEK ON MY GOSH- AND- BUT THERE'S NOT LEGAL AID HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE FAMILY LAW ASSISTANCE IN MANY YEARS OR SHE MAY BE OVER THAT. INCOME LIMITATION. WHAT HAPPENS WHAT- OPTIONS SHE COMES TO SELF HELP SHE HEARD ABOUT IT FROM A FRIEND OR FROM THE COURT OR SOMEBODY SHE'LL COME IN IT NORMALLY SHE'LL BE- IF IT'S A SMALL COURTROOM PROBABLY BE DOING WHEN WE WENT ON WHEN ASSISTANCE IF IT'S A LARGER COURT A LOT OF SHOPPING WORKSHOPS SETTING AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE HE CONSERVE NINE PEOPLE IN A WORKS SAID FOR AND GIVE THEM THREE HOURS TO EXPLANATION YOU'D ONLY BE TO SERVE PEOPLE FOR TWENTY MINUTES IF YOU WERE DOING ONE ON ONE. SO YOU CAN ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND SHE CAN GET THE INFORMATION SHE NEEDS AND THE CAMARADERIE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE SO IT ISN'T THAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH THIS HERSELF SHE'S PART OF IT UNITY SHE'LL GET HER PAPERWORK DONE GEN THAT IS SO THAT SHE CAN FILE WITH THE COURT SAYING USING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES THOSE PLEADING BUT JUST AS MUCH OF REFER THE KIND OF. XIN ON. YOUR SITE AND MARK TO BE A TO DO THE MAN TO STARTED DISCLOSE. TO YOUNG GO HOME AND FIND OUT OF THE INCOME TOGETHER HER SCHEDULE AND DEBTS ALL THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER. NORMALLY THAT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING SO PEOPLE COME BACK IN AND GET OME MORE HELP- TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND AT THAT POINT. A LOT OF TIMES THE CASE COULD BE COMPLETED MANY MANY CASES GO BY DEFAULT WHERE THE OTHER SIDE DOESN'T NECESSARILY RESPOND AND AS LONG AS THE INFORMATION IS IN THE- IN. THE CASE CAN BE FINISHED UP WITH THE PAPERWORK. OTHER TIMES STILL HAVE AN AGREEMENT. AND THAT AGAIN COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THOSE FINAL PAPERS AND THEY CAN WALK AWAY WITHOUT A JUDGMENT. FOR THE OTHER PERSON MIGHT RESPOND IT MIGHT HAVE COME TO THE SELF HELP CENTER IN AND DECIDED THAT WAS IN. THE OP THAT PERSON'S BEST INTERESTS. AND SO THEN THE COURT CAN- WORK ON SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES WORK ON ASSISTANCE FOR THE PERSON WITH TRIAL WHATEVER IT IS. BUT THE GOAL IS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT HAS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL WITH THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IS BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE SETTLEMENT DISTANCE PEOPLE. MOST OBVIOUSLY LIKE TO GET CASE DONE. THEY WANT TO BE SPANKING COURT SYSTEM FOR EVER COMING BACK FROM WHERE I'M HEARINGS THAT WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET THINGS DONE. BUT THANK YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT IS. REASONABLE APPROPRIATE. TO I'M ALONG IF MANY TEMPER ORDERS FOR SUPPORT FOR TEST FOR HIM FOR. ALL THIS KINDS OF THINGS AND MAKING THAT SUPPORT. SO WHETHER IT'S IN A GROUP SETTING WHETHER IT'S ONE ON ONE PEOPLE ARE MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THESE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS. AND TRULY- GETTING REAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AND THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION DATA IS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH- WHERE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY WERE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT THEY KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE AND THEY CAN PROCEED WITH HER CASE- AND AS WE KNOW FROM- THEY TESTED CCAP STEADY. CUSTODY IS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH OF CONCERN FOR PEOPLE. ALL THE LEGAL PROBLEMS IT'S THE THING THAT REALLY MOST AFFECTS THEIR LIVES. SO IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE. AND BY HAVING THE PERSON AT THE SELF HELP CENTER% THEY CAN A HELP A PERSON FRAME THE CASE AND RESOLVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. BUT ALSO. BE THAT PERSON SAID THAT THE JUDGE IS ABLE TO NAY THE IF. AND MAKE MORE OF A DECISION BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW RATHER THAN ANY KIND PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS. SO BUT THEN WE HAVE THE LANDLORD TENANT SITUATION THE SAME PERSON MAYBE BEING KICKED OUT OF HER HOUSE RIGHT BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN IN SELF HELP NORMALLY WITH TENANTS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PROVIDING THEM AN ANSWER AND BUYING THEM SOMETIME AND- SAID THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY POTENTIALLY TO TALK THE LANDMARK BUT I WILL SAY HAVING REVIEWED HUNDREDS OF FILES- FOR THE DRIVER EVALUATION- WE DO A GREAT JOB WITH THE PAPERWORK BUT NEGOTIATING OR GOING TO TRIAL AGAINST AND EXPERIENCED- LAWYER IS. INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT WITH LITTLE OR IN TERMS OF HELPING PEOPLE ON HELPING WITH. BUT I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT'S AN AREA AT THAT AT THAT TRIAL LEVEL PET SETTLEMENT LEVEL WHERE I DO THINK REPRESENTATION IS REALLY FUNDAMENTAL. BUT WHAT YOU'D SEE IN SELF HELP IS THAT- THAT PERSON MAY HAVE LET ANOTHER PERSON STAY IN THE HOME TO BE ABLE. I'M SURE ROOM IN ORDER TO MAKE IT SAYS. I DON'T IF THAT PERSON DOES PAY. THAT PERSON IS CONSIDERED A LAMB OR- SHE'S TO HAVE TO FILE AN EVICTION ACTION TO GET THAT PERSON OUT IF SHE HAD A HOME AND THAT- SHE BROUGHT SOMEBODY IN EITHER TO BE NICE. OR TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT A FORECLOSURE. OF WERE BEING ABLE CARE PROPERTY TAXES SHE IS NOW WITH THE LANDLORD AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE STATE THAT IS PROVIDING ASSISTANCE IN THOSE CASES TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM LOSING THEIR HOMES. THAN SELF HELP AND SO AGAIN WE NEED THAT SORT OF CONTINUUM OF SERVICES OF TO BE ABLE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY I WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO. I WOULDN'T THAT LOWER LIMITS. IT IS A HUGE POP. IN IN FACT AND HELP. IN MANY COURTS ABOUT HALF THE TO BE SIR. ARE THOSE LANDLORDS. AND HALF OF THEM ARE TENANTS. SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SORT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL UNFAIRNESS OF THE ISSUES AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY- GET TAXES TO THE COURT SYSTEM. AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES AND TO START THINKING ABOUT THIS IN A SORT OF MODULAR WAY. AND SINCE I HAVE TWENTY SECONDS I'M JUST GOING TO SAY PART OF THE THING IS WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN BY DOING AGAIN YOU MAY BE COMING IN. BUT YOU MAY BE TALKING TO SOMEBODY ON SKYPE- EITHER IN A WORKSHOP SETTING- AT THE COURTHOUSE OR ON YOUR OWN. LAPTOP FOR YOUR OWN PHONE- WE ALSO HAVE A SELF HELP WEBSITE WE HAVE SIX MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR WHO USE THE SELF HELP WEBSITE WITH STEP BY STEP INFORMATION. IT'S FULLY TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE TRYING TO COLLECT OF. A HOW TO RESPOND IF THE DEBT COLLECTOR IS COMING AFTER YOU AGAIN HOW DO YOU DO THAT AND IT MAY INVOLVE NEGOTIATION BUT ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. WE HAVE A WEBSITE THAT SET UP FOR THE SELF HELP PROFESSIONALS SO THAT THEY CAN SHARE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION SO THAT THEY'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WAY ALL. AND WITH A TRADING MATURE IT'S AN SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS. AND THEN HAVE DEVELOPED A GUIDELINES FOR OPERATION OF SELF HELP CENTERS AND DEVELOP TOOLS. SO THE COURTS CAN. IDENTIFY WHAT THEY CAN DO BETTER AND HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE. WE DID WE ARE ABLE THEY DO TRAININGS- AND THAT IS HE NOR MISLI HELPFUL BOTH IN PERSON SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AND TALK. AND ALSO- ONLINE TRAINING. AND WE HAVE A VERY ACTIVE LISTENER OF. SO I REALLY OUR- COMMAND THE COMMITTEE ON ITS WORK HAD THE THOUGHTFULNESS AND AGAIN URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE CONTINUUM OF ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LEGAL NEEDS. THE REPRESENTATION IS KEY FOR SOMETHING'S BUT MAY NOT BE ACROSS NECESSARY FOR OTHERS LEGAL ASSISTANCE AS NECESSARY. BUT IT MAY NOT BE FULL REPRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS BERNARDO THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE CHAIRWOMAN WEBER COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. YOUR COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE THE PIONEERS OF SELF HELP LEGAL SERVICES WE SERVE ON THE FRONTLINE OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE CREATED BY ACT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND OUR MISSION REMAINS THE SAME TODAY TO PROVIDE FREE ACCESS TO LEGAL SIR. MATERIALS TO ALL PERSONS COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE OFTEN THE BEST AND ONLY OPTION FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR LEGAL INFORMATION. AND TULARE COUNTY OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE USE STARS LIBRARY SERVICES LAST YEAR AND THAT NUMBER GROWS EACH YEAR. EVERY DAY LAW LIBRARIES HELP IN MATTERS OF JUSTICE CUSTODY DISPUTES EVICTIONS LEGAL FORMS BUT OUR BREAD AND BUTTER ARE THE RANGE OF QUESTIONS FROM PEOPLE. MANY REFER ADDRESS FROM SELF HELP CENTERS QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPUNGEMENT PROPERTY HOW TO START A BUSINESS IMMIGRATION DISCRIMINATION ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. BANKRUPTCY VETERANS RIGHTS END OF LIFE PLANNING THE LIST GOES ON. PEOPLE KNOW LIBRARIES AS SAFE FRIENDLY PLACES WHERE EVERYBODY CAN GO FOR HELP COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE THE CITY WERE ALL ABOUT PERSONAL ASSISTANCE. WE HELP EVERYONE LITIGANTS AND NON LITIGANTS ALIKE NO LEGAL SUBJECT OUTSIDE OUR SCOPE OF SERVICE NO RESTRICTIONS BY INCOME LEVEL. BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER HANDLED A LEGAL MATTER ON THEIR OWN OUR LIBRARIANS ARE TRAINED TO LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THEIR STORE. TO REACH THE LEGAL QUESTION THEY NEED HELP WITH. WE HOPE THE GRANDMOTHER ASKING HOW TO TRANSFER HER HOME TO HER GRANDKIDS THE NEW DEADLINE TO UNDERSTAND HOW PAID FAMILY LEAVE FORKS. AND WHEN THERE'S A NATURAL DISASTER BUT LOCAL LAW LIBRARIES HELP VICTIMS WITH THE QUESTIONS ABOUT FEMALE ASSISTANCE INSURANCE SMALL BUSINESS FUNDING AND MORE. WE ALSO REFER PEOPLE TO OTHER AGENCIES WHO CAN ALSO HELP. CALIFORNIA'S LAW BY PRES OVER HALF OF MEAL MILLION PEOPLE IN PERSON LAST YEAR. MOST LIBRARIES KEEP LEGAL SELF HELP BOOKS AND PRACTICE GUIDE IN PRINT AND ITS PEOPLE HAVE GROWN COMFORTABLE WITH TECHNOLOGY LIBRARIES HAVE ADDED MORE PUBLIC COMPUTERS AND FREE WIFI. WE PROVIDE FREE ACCESS TO EXPENSIVE ONLINE LEGAL DATABASES LIKE WESTLAND LEXUS. AND THE POPULAR PLAIN ENGLISH SELF HELP BOOKS FROM NOLO PRESS. SOME LIBRARIES HAVE GROWN BEYOND THE FOUR WALLS TO HAVE BRANCH LIBRARIES AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER AGENCIES. OUR LIBRARY STAFF THE STATE WIDE ASK A LAW LIBRARY WHICH IS A FREE ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDING. LIVE CHAT WITH A LIBRARIAN. SOME LIBRARIES HAVE BECOME VIBRANT ACTIVE LEGAL EDUCATIONAL CENTERS WHICH MY COLLEAGUE WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT POUND. I DO WANT TO DISPEL THREE MYTHS LAW LIBRARIES ONE COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE JUST FOR ATTORNEYS FALLS. INTO LARRY COUNTY OVER 80% OF THOSE WE HELP IN OUR LIBRARY ARE NON ATTORNEYS WITH THE GAP IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE EVER WIDENING ALL OUR LIBRARIES ARE SEEN MORE MORE PEOPLE HAVING TO HANDLE THEIR OWN LEGAL MATTERS. EVERY MYTH TO EVERYTHING IS ON THE INTERNET NO. LEGAL PRACTICE GUIDES AND SAMPLE FORMS ARE EXPENSIVE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL LEGAL PUBLISHERS DON'T GIVE AWAY FOR FREE ON THE INTERNET. BUT THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN OUR LAW LIBRARIES AND ARE SKILLED PROFESSIONALS CAN CONNECT PEOPLE WITH RELIABLE ONLINE RESOURCES AND PRACTICE GUIDES TOGETHER. THE LIBRARIAN HELPS PEOPLE GET ON AND STAY ON TRACK ON MY DESK IS A COFFEE MUG FROM THE LIBRARY OF CAL CONGRESS THAT SAYS LIBRARIAN THE REGIONAL SEARCH ENGINE. LAW LIBRARIANS ARE THE FACE OF LEGAL INFORMATION. MATH THREE THE COUNTY LAW LIBRARY IS A COUNTY DEPARTMENT NOT TRUE. THE COUNTY LAW LIBRARY IS AN pINDEPENDENT PUBLIC AGENCY GOVERNED BY A LOCAL BOARD OF TRUSTEES. UPWARDS OF 90% OF THE LIE DEEP LIBRARIES FUNDING COMES FROM A VERY SMALL PORTION OF ITS SUPERIOR COURT CIVIL FILING FEE. AND BECAUSE THE LIBRARIES SO DEPENDENT ON PAID FILING FEES THE LEVEL OF SERVICE IS VERY BETWEEN COUNTIES. IF THERE WERE DEPENDABLE FUNDING FOR COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES THEN THE SERVICES I'VE TALKED BUT WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE ACROSS COUNTIES. IN CLOSING YOUR COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE WORKING HARD TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT SOMETHING'S WILL ALWAYS STAY THE SAME LAW LIBRARIES WILL ALWAYS BE A PLACE WHERE EVERY PERSON IS WELCOME. WITH THE FREEDOM TO LEARN ABOUT ONCE LEGAL RIGHTS WILL ALWAYS BE PROTECTED. AND WHERE THE PURSUIT OF THE RULE OF LAW WILL ALWAYS BE RESPECT. IS AN HONOR FOR US TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR BECAUSE REALLY BACK NAY BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT. YOU BOTH DO IS ABOUT PROVIDING SELF HELP RESOURCES. LOVE LIBRARIES ALSO FOR ATTORNEYS FROM TIME TO TIME BUT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT AND REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. TALK ABOUT THE COORDINATION BETWEEN LAW LIBRARIES AND SELF HELP CENTER'S BUT ALSO AMONG LAW LIBRARIES SELF HELP CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE- AS I GO AROUND AND TALK DIFFERENT COUNTIES WE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF. FUNDING AND ABILITY AND CAPABILITY REALLY BOTH OF OUR LIBRARIES AND WITH. SELF HELP CENTERS SO HOW DO WE IMPROVE COORDINATION HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT THESE RESOURCES AND MAKING THEM AVAILABLE ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THAT'S REALLY FOR EACH OF YOU. I THINK WE ALL WANT TO DO THAT WE WANT TO COURT DATE WE WANT TO WORK CLOSER TOGETHER AND SOMETIMES IT'S- MAYBE IT'S JUST. I THINK IT STAFF TIME. HONESTLY AS I READ THE RESPONSES FROM OUR- FROM SELF HELP CENTER STAFF IT WAS USUALLY OH MY GOD I'VE GOT THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WAITING OUT THE DOOR AND I WOULD LOVE TO GO MEET AND DO MORE THINGS BUT I AM OVERWHELMED I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE WE CERTAINLY HAVE SELF HELP CENTERS THAT ARE CO OF IT EITHER- IN SANTA CRUZ. THE SELF HELP SET A LAW LIBRARY I IS ALSO PART OF THE SELF HELP CENTER AND NEVADA COUNTY THEY KIND OF MERGED AND THEIR CORRUGATED THERE'S A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH REFERRALS AND PARTICULARLY. FOR CASES WHERE SOMEBODY DOES NEED TO DO AS WERE MOVING MORE INTO CIVIL CASES I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT AS PEOPLE HAVE TO DO MORE RESEARCH IN FAMILY LAW WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO GET THINGS ON FORMS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE A LOT OF. MOTIONS OUR POINTS AND AUTHORITIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT F YOU CAN GET IT NOW BUT IN THE FORM YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY AND HONESTLY WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON OUR WONDERFUL JUDGES TO HELP MOVE SOME OF THOSE CASES THROUGH BUT FIRST OF ALL I THINK THAT BECOMES MUCH MORE INJURED. BUT THERE IS A WE SLEEP WITH TWO LOT MORE COORDINATION BUT I THINK IN MANY MANY COUNTIES ARE OUT OUR VERY STRONG TOPICS AND THE WHEN IT COMES TO MIND AND LA. LAWLER HAS MORE SPACE THE SELF CENTERED AND THEY HAVE WORK TO DO TUNES WHERE THEY CAN HAVE SOME OF THE SERVICES FOLLOW BRADY BUTLER BREAK OPEN FOR HOURS AFTER THE COURT CAN IN. SOME SITUATIONS. WE WILL WELL THE COURT NATION AND THE CO. WITH THE COLLEAGUE IN SELF HELP. AND THE AND OTHER IN THE BONO SERVICE. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR TO BILL THOSE CLOSE. IT AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE I HAVE HAD. BOTH GROUPS COME AND TALK TO ME AND IN REALLY YOUR IN THE SAME BUSINESS AND SO FIGURING OUT. HOW RECORDED HOW WE LEVERAGE AND DISTINGUISH WHERE APPROPRIATE BUT WORK TOGETHER ON THE BROADER SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR A REPRESENT LITIGANTS IS. REALLY KEY YEAH I WILL SAY BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE READY FOR THE COURT BUDGET WE USED TO HAVE REGULAR TO- COORDINATION MEETINGS WITH TEAMS- FROM THE SELF HELP CENTER FROM THE LAW LIBRARY THE SMALL CLAIMS ADVISOR. AND A JUDICIAL OFFICER IN COURT ADMINISTRATOR TO WORK ON THOSE- LOCAL PLANS AND COORDINATION. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS ONE THING THAT UNFORTUNATELY SORT OF WENT AWAY WITH- THE RECESSION BUT- THOSE KINDS OF SERVICES ARE GREAT I WOULD SAY THE MAJOR DISTINGUISHING FEATURE BETWEEN THE LAW LIBRARIES AND SELF HELP. IS IT IN SELF HELP FOR THE MOST PART WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE GET THEIR FORM STAND AND IT OFFICE FOR PROCESSING THINGS AND CLEARLY- THE LAW LIBRARIANS ARE ALSO YOU DON'T DIRECTING PEOPLE IN MANY WAYS AND- HELPING THEM WITH RESOURCES. BUT MUCH OF THE FOCUS IN SELF HELP AREAS WORK ON AT WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU READY TO GO TO COURT- OR HELP YOU YOUR STAND WITH YOUR YOUR NECK STEPS ARE OR WHAT I. IT MAY NOT SENSE A FREE. I DEPENDING ON YOUR SITUATION SO I THINK HAVE MADE HER STE DISTINGUISH FACT. IN SMALL. PARTICULARLY IN THE WORLD. THE SELF HOW CENTER IS OFF THE- A TURN AND WE CAN DON'T HAVE IT LAWLER. SOME SOME OF THE SMALL. AND SO THEIR HAND. EVERYTHING THEY TO. DO IMMIGRATION BANKRUPTCY KIND OF WHATEVER COMES IN THE DOOR AND TRY TO PROVIDE SOME BASIC ASSISTANCE SERVE OUR COUNTRY LAWYER- KIND OF MODEL. BUT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU. SEE AN ART COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES IS THAT WE GO BEYOND AND WE HAVE LONG FOR A LONG TIME ON BEYOND. BASIC CIVIL AND UP FAMILY LAW- TOPICS WE'VE GONE BEYOND INTO THE FEDERAL AND WE HAVE TO DO THAT MINISTRY THEY HAVE. AGENCY HEARINGS. COVER PROBATE. BUT MATTERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF WHAT SELF HELP CENTERS ARE DOING. TRUE OKAY QUESTIONS FROM. THE DEATH SO WAS WHAT. YES ARE WELL THANK THANK OF YOU FOR YOU FOR YOUR AND GIVING US THE SAME FROM THE SIDE I'M TRYING TO THINK OF THEM HOW FAR ARE WE AWAY FROM WHERE WE NEED TO BE. ON SELF HELP- WE'RE NOT THAT FAR OR MAYBE FORTY FIVE MILLION AWAY- IF WE CONTINUE THIS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS. THE PARTS IDENTIFIED IN NEED OF ABOUT SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS- TWO YEARS AGO. OUR I WILL SAY AS WE MOVE INTO CIVIL. I THINK THAT MAY BE A LITTLE ONSERVATIVE. I THINK AS WE START DOING MORE CIVIL CASES- IT IS IT'S MORE COMPLEX WE HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN FAMILY LAW- TRY TO MAKE THINGS EASIER. BUT I DON'T THINK WITHOUT PARK. AND BUT IN AND IT AGAIN THE THING THAT'S GREAT IS THEN WE CAN PROVIDE ASSISTANCE A REALLY RELATIVELY LOW COST. AND IDENTIFY THOSE CASES THAT REALLY NEED LIKE LATE. ARE THEY REALLY NEED A PRO BONO OR THEY REALLY NEED- A PRIVATE ATTORNEY AND THAT'S A KIND OF COURSEONE OF THE OTHER THINGS ITSELF HELPED AS ISRAELI SAYS. I THINK I KNOW THAT YOU THIS IS EASY IF- LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE ISSUES IN THE IN YOUR CASE THAT WILL MAKE THIS DIFFICULT AND- LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND YOU SOME. OTHER OTHER ASSISTANCE. CAN YOU ALL LIBRARY WE A- IT IDENTIFIED OF THE AMOUNT WE'VE LOST SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND THAT'S A SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WILL BRING US BACK TO OUR TWO THOUSAND NINE LEVEL WHEN YOU IN THE FORM CIVIL FEES. UNIFORM CIVIL FEE ACT WAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. OKAY I S. I SIMPLY ASK THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I GO INTO A MEETING PEOPLE OF ALWAYS TELL ME WHERE WOULD NOT- THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT I DON'T AND I AND I RECOGNIZE THAT BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. FIRST OTHER PEOPLE SAY AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO GET TO WHERE WE REALLY SHOULD BE WHAT WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE KIND OF ACCESS THAT WE THINK IS NECESSARY IN CALIFORNIA. THE STAFF AND- BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M CONSTANTLY PIECING TOGETHER STUFF WITH ITS THERE'S A WHETHER IT'S A WOMEN TALKING ABOUT SHOP HERE IN. PRESCHOOLS AND YOU KNOW ALL THAT AND I'M I'M CURRENTLY AS OF COURSE OKAY. I GIVEN AND PEOPLE TELL ME THEY'RE STILL BIG HOLE- I'M NOT SURE IF I'M CONTRIBUTING TO THE WHOLE OR WHAT I'M TELLING THE WHOLE SO. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE WHOLE LOOKS LIKE- SO I CAN HAVE SOME IDEA AS WELL AS- AS WHAT WHAT THE CONFERENCE OF SERVICE WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR THE PEOPLE. SO THERE IS A GREATER SENSE OF ENGAGEMENT IN. AN INFORMATION AND THAT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. I THINK EVERYONE FEELS GOOD THAT THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN DO- BUT PROBABLYNOT THE BEST THIS NECESSARY. AND I THINK THAT'S THE ONGOING CHALLENGE. YEAH AND I THINK THE OTHER THING IS AN ACT WE HAVE BOTH OF US BUT CERTAINLY- ON THE COURT SIDE WE HAVE REALLY ALSO REALLY TRY TO WORK WITH TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK THAT. HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE RIGHT. BEING ABLE FILL OUT FORMS ONLINE. SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF REPETITIVE TYPING AND THE INFORMATION GET SAVE FROM HER. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT TIME SEPARATE THE SELF HELP CENTER. HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. IT USED TO TAKE VOLUNTEER SOMEONE OF OUR PROGRAMS. OUR STUDIO A CONSERVATORSHIP BUT WITH ONE OF THE PROGRAM SO WE DEVELOPED. NOW FIFTEEN MINUTES. RIGHT SO YOU CAN SAY THAT TIME AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN THE PROCESS. AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO SOMEBODY. SO THOSE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGICAL. FOR MAKING. DIFFERENCE HOW MORE IN. ON LINE. HE HE TO RAISE. PHONE UP. SO THAT. WAY COMING. A REAL FOCUS STERN. IS MY- A DIFFERENCE. IT'D CHANGE I. A LOT TRACK PILE TO DO. WE HAD ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. USE LIVE TRACT- IN A VERY SHORT I THINK WITH THIS NINE WEEK PERIOD AND- THEY WERE THRILLED WITH THE ANSWERS. WE WERE STARVING ABOUT SEVEN PEOPLE IN OUR- WITH NO PUBLICITY. IT WAS JUST OFF FROM THE SELF HELP WEBSITE I HAD NO IDEA RIGHT THAT THERE WAS THAT MUCH NEED FOR. NAME CHANGE A PART OF ITS REAL ID PART OF ITS IMMIGRATION THERE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. BUT I THINK THAT COMBINATION. OF USING THE TECHNOLOGY.

I WAS PRACTICING MY TESTIMONY THIS MORNING ON MY COMMUTE FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND REALIZE THAT THE HEAD OF. OUR IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES HAD NEED OF WHITTLED DOWN TO FIVE MINUTES. SO THIS MORNING I GAVE MS. CHRISTIANSEN A COPY OF MY NOTES SO HOPEFULLY THE COMMITTEE HAS RECEIVED COPIES OF THAT SO THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW ALONG AS WELL AS- I'M JUST GOING TO SKIP OVER SOME OF THE DETAILS SO THAT I CAN GET STRAIGHT TO. THE IMPORTANT- MESSAGE THAT I WANT TO PROVIDE TO THIS COMMITTEE AND BASICALLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THE INNOVATIONS IN THE BEST PRACTICES IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE ACT TO CENTER THE OF THE SELF HELP CENTER INSECTS SUPERIOR COURT. AND I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE GAPS IN SERVICE AND UNMET NEEDS THAT ARE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS ARE FACING. I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU OVERVIEW OF THE AXIS IN SAN. IN TWO. WHEN WE WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE PILOT FUNDING. TO EXPAND OUR SELF HELP CENTER TO. EXPAND SERVICES BEYOND THE FAMILY LAW FACILITATOR SERVICES BEYOND. SMALL CLAIMS AND WITH THAT IN TWO THOUSAND WHEN OUR DOORS OPEN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. AND SEVENTEEN YEARS LATER PRETTY MUCH TO THE TO A MONTH OFF. WE ARE- KNOWN IN I'VE BEEN TOLD WE ARE THE CADILLAC OF THE SELF HELP IN IN. THE STATE THAT DOESN'T REALLY NECESSARILY MEAN WERE BETTER THAN OTHER COUNTIES IT MEANS THAT. WE HAD A JUMP START AHEAD OF EVERYONE ELSE. WE RECEIVED. FUNDING FROM MULTI LEGAL SELF HELP CENTER. THE DIVERSITY IN SAN FRANCISCO- REQUIRED THAT WE MEET THAT BI LINGUAL NEEDS OF THE- OF THE POPULATION AND SO MOST OF OUR MATERIALS. THAT OUR TRANSLATOR ARE IN. OTHERS ENGLISH IS CHINA SPANISH RUSSIAN VIETNAMESE. AND TAGALOG. OUR RECRUITMENT OF STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS- IT PRIORITIZES BILINGUAL MULTI LINGUAL- INDIVIDUAL SO THAT WE CAN REALLY. LEVERAGE OUR RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY. SO WITH HIS HEAD IN THE JUMPS WE WERE ABLE TO- HAVE A LOT OF GROWING PAINS CHIU. A DID. METHODS OF SERVER DELIVERY. AS WELL AS I'M COME BACK AROUND AND REVISITING METHODS THAT WORKED BEFORE IT DIDN'T WORK AND A REVAMP IT TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES AND INCREASE OUR NUMBERS. TO MAXIMIZE HOW WE CAN HELP THE PUBLIC. THEN WITH THAT IN MIND- WE DEVOTE ACCESS CENTER THAT WE HAVE TODAY I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A SNAPSHOT PICTURE. WE ARE HOUSE IN THE COURTHOUSE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF REAL ESTATE IN THE COURTHOUSE BECAUSE OUR COURT WERE UNDERSTANDS COURT ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THAT WE NEED A LOT OF SPACE AND FACILITIES FOR THE PEOPLE COMING THROUGH OUR DOORS. OF OUR MODEL IS- NOT WANT IF SMALL SELF HELP IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IF YOU BUILD IT THEY COME AND WE TRY TO HAVE A- ONE STOP SHOP APPROACH MEANING WE DON'T WANT TO REFER FOLKS OUT IF WE CAN HELP THEM. WITH OUR SERVICES HOWEVER IF LEGAL SERVICES OR OTHER AGENCIES PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THAT PERSON OFFICIALS CASE TYPE IT'S BETTER TO. TO REFER FOLKS OUT TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND WHO CAN GIVE MORE SUPPORT TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. SO WITH THE ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS- WITH THE FAMILY LAW FACILITATOR IN SMALL CLAIMS THERE'S MUCH MORE CASE TYPES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE NEEDED BY THE PUBLIC SO. ARE IF YOU LOOK AT OUR NOTES ARE OUR MENU OF SERVICES HAVE BEEN OR HAVE AN EXPANSION OF ALL AREAS OF FAMILY LAW INCLUDING. SAME SEX MARRIAGES WITH. CAN FOR PARENTAGE. INSTEAD PARENT ADOPTIONS AND THAT BASICALLY THE SAME SEX MARRIAGES WHERE THE CHILD IS BORN DURING THE MARRIAGE THE PARENTS. WHICH LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE TWO MOTHERS THE BIRTH MOTHER AND THE OTHER MOTHER ARE ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. THEY ARE THE PARENTS OF THIS CHILD BUT- OF RECOGNITION OF THE LEGAL STATUS IN THE RELATIONSHIP THE CHILD. MAY BE AT AN ISSUES SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO HAVE AN ADOPTION DECREE TO CONFIRM THAT THE PARENTAGE OF THAT. UP FOR THAT CHILD SO THOSE TYPE OF SERVICES ARE THE EXPANSION OF FAMILY LAW NOT JUST YOUR YOUR YOUR BREAD AND BUTTER FAMILY LOG OUT DIVORCES CUTS YOU VISITATION WEEK WE HAVE TRIED TO EXPAND. THOSE SERVICES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF WHAT'S COMING THROUGH OUR DOORS WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND SAN FRANCISCO. WE PROVIDE A NAME AND GENDER CHANGES WE PROVIDE. OUT SMALL CLAIMS ASSISTANCE AND RESIDENTIAL. UNLAWFUL DETAINER STARTED CHIP BUT THE PERSON CONSERVATIVE SHIP OF THE PERSON MANY OF OUR MENU OF SERVICES ARE VERY BROAD SO THAT'S JUST THE MENU BUT WE DIG DEEPER HOW DO WE GET A CAN. HOW TO SET ASIDE A STIPULATION HOW TO SET ASIDE EL OF A JUDGMENT WHERE THE PARTY WAS INCARCERATED OR WAS IN THE HOSPITAL OR JUST WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT TO COPY THE COURT PROCEEDING OR TO ANSWER THEIR THEIR THEIR- LEGAL MATTER. SO OUR MENU IS PRETTY VAST AND QUITE BROAD AND HAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT ABOUT I DO ONE ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT WAS WHO WAS ONLY ONE MAN ON MY GOODNESS SO OUR WISH LIST OUR WISH LIST IS- IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST PAGE OF THE GET THE GAPS OUR WISH LIST IS THAT WE CAN DO MORE SMALL CLAIMS COLLECTION EXPANDING MEDIATION FOR. FOR CALENDARS AND EVERY SMALL CLIP WE HAVE NINETEEN CALENDARS AND IN SAN FRANCISCO ONLY A FEW CALENDARS ARE MET BY OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH THE LAW SCHOOLS SO WE LEVERAGE OF RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY LAW SCHOOL CLINICS WITH MEDIATION. COMPONENTS IN OUR SMALL. WE OUR- OF OUR LEGAL SIR. WE HOUSE TO CONTRACT ATTORNEY IN THE COURT HOUSE THE SHARK SARGENT SHRIVER PROGRAM HAS A SELF HELP COMPONENT WE HAVE THAT ATTORNEY ON SITE SO THAT IS A SEAMLESS TRIAGE. SEAMLESS REFERRAL OF THE SERVICES WE DON'T HAVE TO REFER SOMEONE TO GO INTO THE COMMUNITY TO GET THAT SERVICE. WE MAKE THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND BRING THAT PERSON TO THE SELF. SELF HELP PORTION OF OUR OFFICES WHERE THE LEGAL AID I HOUSE IN ON SITE WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS WHERE. A WE HAVE SATELLITE OFFICES FOR THE DEPARTMENT SUCH CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES HOUSE IN THE COURTHOUSE. RIGHT ACROSS FROM OUR CHILD SUPPORT COURT. COURT ROOM. WE UP GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY REGULARLY TO CHECK OUT REACHED FOR SATELLITE- OUT REACH IN THE IN CHINATOWN WHERE SOME FOLKS MAY NOT WANT TO COME TO. THE COURTHOUSE THEY'RE AFRAID TO COME THROUGH THE METAL DETECTOR THEY DON'T TRUST GOVERNMENT. A WE GO INTO THE COMMUNITY WE MAKE- RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS SO THAT WE CAN- BE INVITED INTO THEIR- THEIR COMMUNITY FAIRS HAVE INFORMATIONAL BOOTHS. BE RECOGNIZED IN THE COMMUNITY BEFORE PEOPLE WANT TO TALK TO US ABOUT THE FORCE OR- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR OTHER ISSUES THAT THEY DON'T WANT- TO BE OUT. KNOWN IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAVE THESE PERSONAL ISSUES. SO WHEN WE GO INTO THE KITCHEN WHERE THE SPANISH. COMMUNITY TO DO THAT SAME TYPE OUT REGION SO OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH SINCE WE ARE SO RICH IN. SAN FRANCISCO WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S LAW SCHOOLS IN. A LEGAL SERVICES EVEN WITH ALL OF THAT WE HAVE UNMET NEEDS IN OUR WISH LIST IS ON THE ON MY LAST PAGE BUT- THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO DO. AND JUST- REALLY REALLY QUICKLY IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE WITH SMALL- OF SELF HELP HELLO LIBRARY SOMEONE SAYS I WANTED. CHANGE MY CHILD'S NAY. AT LAWLER YOU MAY IT RESOURCES WERE THE STATURE WHAT OF FORMS THIS IS YOU CHANGE CHILD NAME WITH THE LAW. IS THE SELF HELP BETTER AFTER. TREE I ING AND FINDING OUT. LEGAL OPTION. AND. WHERE'S THE OTHER PRINT TO BOTH PARTIES AGREE. WE OFTEN. THAT THE NAME CHANGE THE CHILD IS NOW REALLY THE- OF VISIT IT'S A- TO JACK. THIS IS THE NAME OF THE CHILD. TO THE IS NOT THE FATHER. THIS IS NOT THE FATHER I WANTED THE NAME THE CHILD. SHE THE NAME THE OTHER PAIR. THAT BECOMES A HOLD TO BALL OF SETTING. A PARENTAGE OF DICK OR J. OR POPPED. AT THE HIGH. SO THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO TRIAGE AND REALLY THAT IN GET TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS FROM THEIR VISIT AT THE- SELF HELP CENTER AND IT MAY NOT BE THE FIRST OR SECOND. TRIAGE PERSON THAT THEY SEE AT THE AT THE COURT BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT PEOPLE SURROUNDING THAT IS A ONE ON ONE. WITH THE FACED WITH ONE OF MY WORKERS NOW THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE TO DISCLOSE THAT. THE REALLY HERE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO CHANGE PARENTAGE OF THEIR CHILD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR HAVING ME TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SEVEN GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I WISH WE HAD TIME FOR A SESSION OF TRUE PATRONS STORIES. YOU KNOW THE ARTIST WHO LEARNED ALL ABOUT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW AND- AT HER LAW LIBRARY AND STARTED HER OWN BUSINESS. THE HOMELESS MAN WHO PURSUED HIS RATE OF MAN DAVIS FOR OVER A YEAR TO FINALLY WIN BACK. HIS SECTION EIGHT CERTIFICATE AND GET HOUSING. THE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHO WON HER CASE AGAINST A MAJOR. FOR AN AIRLINE CARRIER BECAUSE HER LAW LIBRARY HELP HER FIND THE OBSCURE INTERNATIONAL TREATY THAT ESTABLISHED JURISDICTION. IN THE UNITED STATES. THE VICTIM OF VIOLENT ABUSE IN HIS HOME COUNTRY WHO WAS GRANTED ASYLUM AFTER DRAFTING. AND ASYLUM PETITION WITH THE HELP HE GOT AT HIS LAW LIBRARY. AND I COULD GO ON AND ON. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE'S NO PLACE ELSE THESE PATRONS COULD HAVE GOTTEN HELP WITH THEIR LEGAL ISSUE. THERE WAS NO FORM OR ONLINE RESOURCE THAT COULD HAVE HELPED THEM. AND THERE ARE MILLIONS MORE LIKE THEM. AND THAT'S WHY COUNTY LAW LIBRARIES ARE DEVELOPING ALL KINDS OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE COLLABORATIONS. TO EFFICIENTLY EXPAND THE SCOPE AND REACH OF OUR SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE MANY OF US INVITE LEGAL AID AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE THEIR CLOTHES. AT OUR LOW. THIS PROVIDES A DAMAGE TO EVERY. FOR LEGAL A THEY CAN FOCUS ALL THE RESOURCES UNDER CLAIM. THIS. WE BILLS PROMOTION REGISTRY AND ALL THE INDUSTRY IF. FOR THE LONG. WE GET TO PROVIDE BETTER. TO OUR PAY. AND MORE PEOPLE COMING THE LIGHT. BUT MÃ¹T IMPORTANT. FOR THE PATRON. THEY GET ON GOING ASSISTANCE. LEGAL ISSUE DON'T COME WANTED IT. A PATRON MAY ATTENDED. FOR A CONSERVE. OF A LOVED ONE A RECORD EXPUNGEMENT SO THEY CAN GET BACK TO WORK. BUT IT A LAW LIBRARY THEY CAN ALSO GET HELP WITH EVERY OTHER LEGAL ISSUE THEY HAVE. MAYBE THEY HAVE DEBT THAT'S PILING UP BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN OF CARING FOR THAT LEFT ONE. OR THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH AN OLD TRAFFIC CITATION THAT WENT TO WARRANT SO THEY ACTUALLY CAN GET BACK TO WORK. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN THE CLINIC IS AT CITY HALL OR A PUBLIC LIBRARY OR EVEN IN A COURTHOUSE OR ANYWHERE ELSE OTHER THAN YOUR COUNTY LAW LIBRARY. I'M MANY OF US ALSO SEND OUR STAFF TO. LEGAL REFERENCE ASSISTANCE OR OFFER CLASSES ON LEGAL TOPICS IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES ESPECIALLY IN RURAL OR REMOTE AREAS. BECAUSE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY PATRONS HAVE LEGAL QUESTIONS BUT PUBLIC LIBRARIANS DON'T HAVE LEGAL EXPERTISE. THEY NEED OUR HELP. WERE ALSO COLLABORATING WITH SELF HELP CENTER TO NEW WAYS LIKE ALLOWING THEM TO HOLD PROGRAMS IN LAW LIBRARY SPACE THIS ALLOWS THE PROGRAMMING TO HAPPEN WHEN WORKING PEOPLE CAN ATTEND AND WITHOUT THE INTIMIDATION FACTOR OF GOING INTO A COURTHOUSE LIKE THE LEGAL AID COLLABORATIONS IT ALSO PROVIDES THE CLIENTS. WITH AN ONGOING RESOURCE FOR EVERY OTHER OUT OF SCOPE ISSUE THEY MIGHT HAVE. A COUPLE OF WELL LIBRARIES HAVE EVEN STARTED HAVING A CIVIL ATTORNEY OR MANY CIVIL SELF HELP CENTER IN THE LIBRARY. THIS REQUIRES ESPECIALLY CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE COURT'S SELF HELP CENTER TO AVOID OVERLAP IN SERVICES BUT IT FILLS IN GAPS IN COVERAGE IN A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY. LANGUAGE ACCESS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE MORE COULD BE DONE IF WE HAD ADEQUATE FUNDING. SOME OF US USED ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE TO CONDUCT PILOT PROGRAMS WITH TRANSLATION SERVICES SO THAT REFERENCE ASSISTANCE COULD BE PROVIDED IN ANY OF A HUNDRED DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. INCLUDING AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING MORE AND MORE PARTNERSHIPS WITH LAWYERS LAWYERS IN LIBRARY PROVIDES FREE SHORT CONSULTATIONS WITH THE VOLUNTEER ATTORNEY TO HEALTH HELP SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TING COURT. FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE ON THE RIGHTTRACK AND WHAT THEIR NEXT STEP SHOULD BE ONE COMMENT WE GET REPEATEDLY FROM PATRONS ABOUT LAWYERS IN LIBRARY IS. NOW I HAVE HOPE. SOME DAY EVERY COUNTY LAW LIBRARY SHOULD HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HOLD THESE PROGRAMS. SOME OF US ALSO PARTICIPATE IN LEGAL INCUBATORS DESIGNED TO TRAIN NEWER ATTORNEYS HOW TO DEVELOP A LAW PRACTICE REPRESENTING MODEST MEANS CLIENTS WE HELP TRAIN AND KEEP THE COSTS LOW FOR ATTORNEYS WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR RATES LOW. SOME OF US PARTICIPATE IN REGIONAL EFFORTS AND JOINT TASK FORCES REGARDING DISASTER PREPAREDNESS ARE STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION DISSEMINATES PRINT INFORMATION IN COMMUNITIES WHERE DISASTERS HAVE HIT. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE COMMISSION ABOUT A POSSIBLE STATE WIDE COLLABORATION TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC. FINALLY WE COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER. OUR NEWEST PROJECT IS VERY EXCITING TO US USING ONE TIME FUNDING WE'RE DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF FORMS AND INSTRUCTION PACKETS. UNLIKE COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED DATABASE WHICH WE AREN'T ALLOWED TO SHARE REMOTELY WE CAN SHARE OUR OWN FORM PACKETS AND INSTRUCTIONAL GUIDES AND ID BE WONDERFUL TO ADD SELF HELP CENTER PACKETS TO THAT LIST. ALL OF THESE NEW COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS HELP EXPAND SERVICES IN ACCESS REDUCE COURT COSTS IMPROVE OUTCOMES. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MOST IMPORTANTLY RESTORE FAITH IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BY PROVIDING RESPECTFUL WELCOMING PATIENT SERVICE TO VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH LEGAL ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU. STEPPED IN. SHOP. IT IS YOUR PREFERRED REGISTER SWITCH THE SECOND OF MY IS. OKAY THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE GOVERNOR HIS PROPOSED BUDGET PROVIDE A POINT MILLION FOR THAT FROM THE GENERAL FOR AND FIFTH YEAR TWO TWO ONE AND INCREASE TO FIFTY FIVE FOR AND IN FISCAL YEAR TWO ONE TO TWO TWO ESTABLISH A CORDON PROGRAM IN THE TRI COURT. THE CONCEPT COURT NOW NEVER IS NOT NEW SEVERAL DO MODELS FORMED ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND GENERALLY THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED BY COURTS AND BY THE PUBLIC MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE PROPOSED CAP COURT NAVIGATOR PROGRAM AND HOW IT'S COSTS AND BENEFITS WILL BE ASSESSED. TO AVOID SUSTAINED CHALLENGES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED IN SOME MODELS THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM WOULD BE COURT EMPLOYEES. NAVIGATORS WOULD PROVIDE SERVICES REQUIRING NO LEGAL TRAINING OR CREDENTIALS EVERY EFFORT WOULD BE MADE FOR SOMETHING WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE UNAUTHORIZED PRACTICE OF LAW. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT RESTRICTED TO SELF HELP CENTERS ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY WE CONTEMPLATE NAVIGATORS WOULD HELP OUT THERE. NAVIGATORS COULD BE DEPLOYED IN MANY COURT LOCATIONS TO PROVIDE NON LEGAL SUPPORT THAT FILLS GAPS IN OTHER SERVICES THAT ADDRESS PHYSICAL REMOTE OR EQUAL ACCESS BARRIERS. FOR EXAMPLE NAVIGATORS COULD PROVIDE BRITAIN MARKED HIS MOVEMENTS GETTING WRITTEN MATERIAL OR STANDARD RESPONSES TO IN CRIER IS BY PHONE EMAIL OR IN PERSON IN THE SERVICES COULD HAPPEN BEFORE THE LITIGANTS EVEN APPEAR IN COURT SO THEY- KNOW WHERE TO GO AND WHAT TO DO. IT'S SAID THAT JUSTICE OFTEN CALLS FOR SOMEONE TO JUST LISTEN AND TRY TO HELP AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING IN THE NAVIGATOR PROGRAM. WE'RE HOPING NAVIGATORS WILL FACILITATE PHYSICAL ACTS FOR ACCESS TO THE COURTS WITH LOGISTICS WAY FINDING ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES OR SIMPLY HELP HELPING PEOPLE FIND WHERE THEY NEED TO GOAL OR WHERE THE CHILDREN'S WAITING ROOM MIGHT BE. NAVIGATORS COULD PROMOTE LANGUAGE ACCESS PREFERRED BY PROVIDING TRACK THAT TRANSLATED MATERIALS AND CONNECTION TO INTERPRETER SERVICES. AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT FOR CASE COMPLETION AND REFERRALS TO THAT DATE LITIGANTS LEAVE THE COURT WITH THEIR BUSINESS COMPLETELY FINISHED. SPECIFICALLY WITHIN SELF HELP CENTERS THE NAVIGATORS WOULD PROVIDE NON LEGAL SUPPORT AS DISTINCT FROM THE WELL DEFINED LEGAL ASSISTANCE OR LEGAL INFORMATION SERVICES PROVIDE BY TRAIN SELF HELP CENTER STAFF WERE BY JUSTICE CORPS MEMBERS. IN THESE TYPES OF THE NON LEGAL SERVICES UP AT THE IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE AT ALL COURTS ARE OFTEN PERFORMED BY IF THE SORRY IF THERE WHERE THEY ARE PER PROVIDED IN THE COURTS THERE OFTEN PERFORMED BY HIGHER LEVEL PROFESSIONALS ARE AT. THE EMPLOYEES WHOSE EXPERTISE IS IN HIGH DEMAND AND SO ONE OF OUR OBJECTIVES IS TO TRY TO MOVE IS PART MUCH AS POSSIBLE OFF THE PLATES OF THE PROFESSIONAL SO THERE ARE MORE AVAILABLE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. THE COURT NAVIGATOR PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE ACCESS SERVICES ACROSS THE BOARD WITH SUPPORT COMMUNICATION SHARED INFORMATION. DATA AND TOOLS. SO THE WAY WE CAN SEE THAT IS THAT EACH COURT WOULD IDENTIFY ITS SPECIIC ACCESS GAPS BECAUSE COURTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AS WE DISCUSSED ALREADY. AND THAT COURT WOULD MAKE AN APPLICATION FOR THE MODEL THAT THEY WANT TO IMPLEMENT IDENTIFYING WITH THE NAVIGATOR WOULD DO AND I AND OTHER SPECIFICS ABOUT THE PROGRAM. THE RECORD TO RECEIVE ONGOING INFORMATION TOOLS AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR SERVICE IMPROVEMENT AND I THINK THAT ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS ON GOING IMPROVEMENT TO LEARN AND JUST AS IS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. AN ONLINE NAVIGATOR NAPA NOT  NETWORK WOULD ALSO BE CREATED SO THAT COURTS COULD COMMUNICATE ONLINE WITH EACH OTHER AND SHARE IDEAS AND IT WOULD BE A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO SEE TO LOG WITH SUGGESTIONS AND GIVE FEEDBACK. A PROGRAM ARCHIVE WOULD ALSO HOUSE MATERIALS AVAILABLE TO ALL COURTS THAT WERE DEVELOPED BY ANY ONE OF THEM. SO THERE MIGHT BE OFF THE SHELF PROGRAM RESOURCES TRAINING CURRICULA AND OTHER MATERIALS. THE PROGRAM MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL USE DATA TO ADVICE OPERATIONAL DECISIONS AND SHARE INNOVATIONS WITH COUNTIES AND STATES. COST DATA WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE FINANCIAL RECORDS OF THE PROGRAM SERVICE METRICS WOULD BE LOGGED ON HAND HELD DEVICES ISSUED TO EACH NAVIGATOR SO THAT WE COULD GET REAL TIME REPORTS ON THE TYPE OF SERVICE THE NUMBER OF LITIGANTS SERVED THE TIME SPENT AND WHETHER PROGRESS IS MADE TOWARD COMPLETION OF THE COURT MATTER. WE NOW RIGHT DID A POINT WHERE WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO UPLOAD THAT DATA AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE BOTH TO THE PROGRAM OTHER COURTS AND IN TO THE TO THE COURTS. OF HAVE REAL TIME TO. NAVIGATORS WOULD BE. TO DRAW FOR THE FROM THEIR GREAT ON THE GROUND A- AND MAKES A- FOR. THESE IDEAS TRANSMITTED ON THEIR HAND HELD DEVICES OR TO SUBMITTED THROUGH THE NAVIGATOR NETWORK COULD BE FED BACK TO THE COURTS. CUSTOMERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS SATISFACTION ASSESSMENTS WOULD ALSO BE CRITICAL SO WE COULD BEGIN TO ADJUST THE SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WILL STRIVE FOR INNOVATION IN INFORMATION SHARING TO DEVELOP NAVIGATOR SERVICES THAT MAKE A DEMONSTRABLE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. THANK YOU AND THEN FINAL MEMBER THE PANEL JUDGE BRAZIL. PRESIDING JUDGE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH MUST BE PRETTY EASY TO DO HOUSE IN ORDER AND THEN IN YOUR SPARE TIME YOUR ALSO CO CHAIR OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON ACCESS AND FAIRNESS YES I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT TO OFFER TO TODAY THANK YOU. WELL GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE YOUR WOMAN WEBER AND SIMPLY MEMBER AND READY JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KEVIN BRAZIL IN THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SHOWCASE THE SELF HELP PROGRAMS WE OFFER LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. BEFORE I GET INTO THE SPECIFIC I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU A SHORT VIDEO WHICH IGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF SELF HELP. FOR UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS. THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE MINORITIES ESPECIALLY LATINO ASIAN AFRICAN AMERICAN. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF JUDGES AND SELF HELP CENTER STAFF IN OUR COURT HOUSE. GOING TO COURT INITIALLY ARE EVEN ONGOING IS VERY INTIMIDATING. ON BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT AS- A SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS YOU ARE HELL TO SOMEWHAT THAT STANDARD I SAW MY OWN FAMILY GO THROUGH OUR OWN LEGAL BATTLES AND I SAW JUST HOW. STRESSFUL IT WAS FOR THEM SELF HELP IS IT I FEEL WITH EDUCATIONAL WE HAVE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE COURTS REQUIREMENTS ARE PROCEDURALLY HOW TO DRAFT PEOPLE WORK WHICH CAN BE VERY CUMBERSOME AND VERY CONFUSING WE PROVIDE SERVICES REALLY TO ANYONE WHO NEEDS IT. WE DON'T JUST TURN PEOPLE AWAY BASED ON THEIR INCOME STATUS WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO OFFER SERVICES IN MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ONE THE GAME WAS AFRAID TO COME TO COURT BECAUSE- SHE WAS NO LONGER THE CUSTODIAL PARENT. AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED AND SHE WAS JUST AFRAID TO GO BACK BEFORE THE COURT. AND SO I HELPED HER- FORMULATE HER PAPERWORK IN HER DOCUMENTS IN HER DECLARATION. AND SHE'S LITERALLY NO EXAGGERATION SHE CRIED SHE REALLY CRIED BECAUSE SHE SAID EVERYTHING THAT'S IN HERE IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE FOR THE PAST I THINK IT WAS FIVE YEARS. NICE TO SEE IT FROM THE BEGINNING OR YOU'RE TIMID AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON TO THIS AND POWER- UTILITY SO IT'S REALLY NICE. TO SEE THAT TRANSFORMATION OCCUR I THINK THE ENTIRE PURPOSE OF SELF HELP REALLY AND BODIES THE COURTS MENTION OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE. SO I LA COUNTY WE'RE LAW. SO IS YOU CAN SEE ON THE WE WE'VE GOT TWELVE DISTRICTS. AND HERE THE STARS THEIR SHOW OUR SELF HELP CENTERS WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED THROUGHOUT LA COUNTY PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS. WE'VE GOT TO OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY LANGUAGES THAT ARE SPOKEN- THE LARGEST GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO NEED SELF HELP OR LATINO ASIAN AND AFRICAN AMERICAN- WE HAVE THIRTY NINE COURTHOUSES. AND ALMOST SIX HUNDRED VENTURE OFFICERS SO THE OPERATION IS HUGE AND THE NEED FOR SELF HELP IS ENORMOUS AND WE TRY TO PROVIDE THAT THROUGH THE MANY SELF HELP CENTERS THAT WE HAVE TO ROUTE OR COUNTY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE WERE DRESSING SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS WHO NEED THE SELF HELP. IS WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE THERE'S PRIVATE ATTORNEYS THERE'S LEGAL SERVICE AGENCIES LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD LEGAL SERVICES. THE HANDLE OF THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER MATTERS WE HAVE THAT STATIC WE ALSO HAVE THE STRIVE A PROGRAM WHICH ALSO HAD REPRESENTS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE UNLAWFUL DETAINER MATTERS AND THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IF YOU LOSE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER YOUR HOMELESS. AND WE HAVE A LARGE HOMELESS POPULATION IN LA COUNTY. SO IN TERMS OF. THE SELF HELP NEEDS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CAPACITY OF THE LITIGANT- OFTENTIMES THE LITIGANTS HAVE. MIDDLE WHAT AMOUNT OF EDUCATION AND MAY HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS SO WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. THE CASE COMPLEXITY IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT CAN RANGE FROM A DIVORCE ALL THE WAY TO A CONSERVATORSHIP. SO THAT THE ISSUES ARE QUITE CHALLENGING. BUT WE MANAGE AND AGAIN I THINK A LOT OF THAT. WITH ALLOWS US TO MANAGE IT SO WELL IT'S A GREAT STAFF THAT WE HAVE. SO JUST WANT TO TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR SELF HELP CENTER FUNDING WHAT THEY DO- WE HAVE BILINGUAL STAFF- WE HAVE A MID FOURTEEN COURT HOUSES- THEY COLLABORATE. WITH OTHER. LEGAL SERVICE AGENCIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE- I APPLAUD THE WORK OF THE LA COUNTY LIBRARY THEY ARE LIVE LEE LOCATED ACROSS THE STREET. FROM MY COURTHOUSE SO% WE SEE THEM- AS ONE OF OUR PARTNERS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. SO IN TERMS OF. AS I SAID. THE SPECTRUM OF SERVICES- THIS IS GIVE YOU SOME OF THE NUMBERS- THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN LA COUNTY WHICH ARE HUGE- BUT AGAIN IT'S A LARGE COUNTY TEN MILLION PEOPLE- SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AND WE SEE IT AS A AS A TEAM EFFORT. AND THAT INVOLVES ALL OF US THE COUNTY LIBRARIES YOU PROVIDING US THE FUNDING THAT BENCH OFFICERS AND THE COURT STAFF WE MAKE IT WORK. SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS LANGUAGE ACCESS AS THE SLIDE EARLIER SHOWED THE EARLIER SLIDE SHOWED WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN- SPANISH IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT- AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT A BIT IS THE JUSTICE CORPS. AND HOW WE OPERATE THAT PROGRAM WE HAVE A LOT OF BILINGUAL STAFF AND STUDENTS. WHO HELPED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND BECAUSE- SOMETIMES IT'S NOT RECOGNIZE BUT THE HARDEST THING TO DO. IS IF YOU GO IN A COURT ROOM AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE. IMAGINE YOURSELF IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. BEING PLACED IN A FOREIGN SYSTEM AND YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE. THAT IS SO CRITICAL SO WE TRY TO ADDRESS THAT THROUGH OUR SELF HELP PROGRAM. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO DO IS WE HAVE ONLINE SERVICES. AND WE HAVE MANY MANY DIFFERENT AREAS FROM TRAFFIC CITATIONS TO HELPING THEM WITH THE FORCE WE HAVE KIND OF A GUIDE AND FILE SYSTEM WHERE THE- YOU WALKING THROUGH AND- THE YOUNG LADY TO MY LEFT THAT'S OUR FAVORITE EMPLOYEE GINA. HELP YOU. AND SHE- WILL. BE SO OF DIFFERENT. SO YOU MIGHT WANT OKAY JACK CHILL TODAY. SO ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT OF THAT THE JUSTICE CORPORATE IT'S BEEN AN EGG. SINCE TWO. FOUR IT'S IN LAW ANGELES COUNTY DIEGO. TO BEAR. AND BASICALLY WHAT WE HAVE THE- ARE CARL STUDENTS. WHO WORK AT OUR SELF HELP CENTERS AND THEY DO CLASSES THEY WALKED THE PEOPLE THROUGH IN TERMS OF FILLING OUT THE FORMS. SHOWING THEM WHERE THE COURT ROOM IS. KIND OF PRETTY MUCH GUIDING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS- WE LIKE TO CALL THEM BLUESHIRTS THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE OF. THE YOUNGSTERS IN THE BLUESHIRTS THAT'S HOW WE IDENTIFY HIM THROUGHOUT THE COURT. SO IF YOU EVER DOWN IN LOS ANGELES COME ON INTO THE MÃ¡S COURTHOUSE RHYME MATTER ANY OF OUR- OTHER CENTERS AND YOU'LL SEE ALL THE BLUESHIRTS. WALKING THROUGH THE CORRIDORS OF THE COURTHOUSE BUT THEY'RE THERE TO HELP PEOPLE- AND A LOT OF THEM COME BACK SOME OF THE MOVE EVEN GOT ON TO BE LAWYERS SO. IT'S A GOOD EXPERIENCE- IT HELPS THEM INTO THE OF LEADERSHIP. SOME OF THE CIVIL THAT WE FOR IN CELL HELP. MAINLY REALLY YOU WANT IMPAIR PEOPLE KIND OF WHAT THE- TALK ABOUT THIS PEOPLE COME THE CO. AND THEY CAN BUT- TO CAN BE CAN. SO SELF HELP IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU CAN MUCH. BETTER EXCEPT THE RESULT. SO WE TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN LA COUNTY WITH OUR SELF HELP SERVICES. WE HAVE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE. WHO HELP US TO DO IT. OUR STAFF. JUSTICE FOR PEOPLE AND WE ARE VERY VERY GRATEFUL. SO ONE SIZE AS WE SAID DOESN'T FIT ALL BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THAT IN REGARDS TO SELF HELP- WE BUILT OVER A BUS AND EXPENSE OF SELF HELP SYSTEM THANKS IN PART TO YOUR FOR SITE. AND FINDING. AND CONTINUED PRIORITIZATION OF SELF HELP. AS A RESULT OF OUR PROGRAMS LITIGANTS ARE COMING TO COURT PREPARED AND I CAN'T STRESS. ENOUGH BEING PREPARED BECAUSE WHEN THEY'RE-UNPREPARED. IT DELAYS THINGS IN THE LAKE BECAUSE THIS MONEY DOESN'T IT HURTS US AS A CORE IN TERMS OF BEING EFFICIENT. HAVING PEOPLE TO COME TO COME BACK SOME PEOPLE ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS A PROBLEM SO SEC PUBLISHED. TO MAKING SURE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACTUALLY HAS MEETING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SO HAVING SEEN THE PROPOSAL FOR THE NAVIGATORS AND- ESPECIALLY WITH WITH THE FOLKS HERE AT. AT THE TABLE BECAUSE IT'S LAW LIBRARY SELF HELP CENTERS AND OTHERS. HOW DOES ALL THIS FIT TOGETHER SO THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING SERVICES AND THAT THAT WE PROVIDE THIS THIS CONTINUOUS ABILITY TO COORDINATE ALL OF THIS ACROSS THE BOARD. AND THEN FROM WITH WHAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS LOOKING AT A THINK THAT'S KIND OF PART PARCEL TO THIS. SO IT IS AS WE LOOK AT A SYSTEM THAT HAS DEVELOPED OVER TIME. BECAUSE OF THE NEED WHICH IS GREAT BUT HOW DO WE- FORMALISE THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SERVICES ACROSS ALL OF OUR COUNTIES LA BEING LITTLE FORGES COURTS. PROBABLY IN THE COUNTRY WE ARE YEAH I WITH THAT WOULD EXPECT SO. WHICH HAS ITS OWN CHALLENGES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SOME OF OUR MORE RURAL COUNTIES WHERE ACCESS IS AS IMPORTANT WITH SOME THE DISTANCES PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL THE WAY THAT THAT. THE COURTS ARE SPREAD OUT. HOWDO WE HAVE THIS COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM THAT WE PUT TOGETHER THAT WE'RE NOT NOW DUPLICATING THAT WERE MANAGING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL. YEAH THANK DEAL WITH NEXT. WITH THE NAVIGATORS IT'S JUST BY A THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. LOOK AT YOUR SAID. MANY OF THE PROGRAM WILL HAVE A WILL JUST JUST FOUND. ON GAVE SEGUE FAN PROPOSED PROBABLY CAN'T TAKE THAT THE SCALE BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF A COMMUNITY CAL COLLABORATION WE GET GREAT BENEFIT FROM AS WELL- SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE WITH THE NAVIGATORS IS ASK EACH COURT TO LOOK AT THEIR SYSTEM AS A SYSTEM. AND TO LOOK AT IT WE'RE IS HELP NEEDED AND WHERE IS IT THE RIGHT MATCH BETWEEN THE CREDENTIALS OF QUALIFICATIONS OF THE HELPERS AND THE NEEDS OF THE OF THE LITIGANTS IF THEY MAKE A PROPOSAL IS A BUSINESS PROPOSAL THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH NAVIGATORS. THEN WE START GIVING THEM ALL THE SUPPORT CAN AND CONNECTING THEM SO THAT THEY CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER WE HOPE THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S RICH IN IDEAS. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE NOT DURING WHAT HAD. I'M COULD WHO SERVE HOW MANY. AND GET THE RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROVIDING THIS RECESS WERE THEY RECOMMEND SO WE THINK THAT MIGHT STARTING THE GROUND AND TRACKING AND COMMUNICATING WITH. BE ABLE TO COME WITH THE BEST ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER DO YOU TO IN THE LAW LIBRARY LAW LIBRARIES ARE SORT OF FUND SEPARATELY. KIND OF LOOK THAT'LL BIT TO. THE SELF HELP SO ARE PART OF THE COURTS I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING AT ALL THE COMPONENTS AND TYING THEM INAPPROPRIATELY SO SINCE I'M REPRESENTING WALLER HELPED TACKLE THAT WENT. IN SOME WAYS I THINK OUR ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS EASIER THAN FOR SOME OF THE OTHER AGENCIES BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY THE GAL FOR. HANDLE WHAT ELSE DUCKS SO WHAT'S IN TO US IS THE CAN. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT WHAT'S BEING HANDLED HIMSELF HELP WORK PREFERRED WITH SELF CENTER WITH BEING HANDLED BY PLAYED WHERE REFERRED DELAY. BUT WHAT THEY'RE NOT. OUR WITH IN STATE COURT ISSUES MORE CA. SELECT OR UNIQUE PIECES WERE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS REQUIRED. AND THAT OF THING IT'S NOT FORM BAY. BUT ALSO OUTSIDE OF STAY. COURTS THERE ARE. IN THE- CORE THERE ADMIN. COURT THERE ARE. COURTS AND YOU GO BY. THAT TO NON COURT REALLY ISSUE ARE THINGS THAT WE HOPE WILL NEVER GET COURT. OF DISPUTE THAT ARE HOW. WITH LAND LOW TENANT. OVER. GOOD GOVERNMENT CAN CREDIT HOW TO START A BUSINESS THERE'S EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN THAT IS A LEGAL ISSUE THE LIST OF LEGAL ISSUES IN IN THE- FOLDERS THAT THAT WE HANDED UP FROM THE LAW LIBRARIES- ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THOSE PAGES THERE'S A LIST. THAT THE SAMPLING FOR ONE WEEK AT COUNTY LAW LIBRARY SO SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT CAME IN AND YOU'LL SEE IT'S ALL ACROSS THE BOARD AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE WILL HANDLE ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO US IS THE COMMUNICATION THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COURTS AND- IN LA I CAN SAY IT'S WONDERFUL WE- WILL. WORK WELL WITH OUR OUR COURT IN OUR SELF HELP CENTER AND WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HANDLING AND AS THIS OF HELP CENTER EXPAND TO MORE CIVIL WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN. BUT BEACH JUST THAT CAN YOU TO KNOW THEY'RE HANDLING BECAUSE ITS CONFUSING FOR US IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CLIENTS RIGHT THE LITIGANTS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS MAYBE THEY CAN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE LEGAL ISSUE WAS DISCUSSED BEFORE BUT IF THEY DO RECOGNIZE IT'S A LEGAL ISSUE. THEY DON'T KNOW AND WALL UPGRADE LIBRARIES IN GENERAL ARE SORT OF A TRUST BRING. PEOPLE UNDER. THAT LIFE HOW. AND COME TO US IN M. I'VE GOT THIS ISSUE I THINK IT LEGAL SHOULD I BE. AND IF WE HAVE ALL THE AND- ABOUT WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING THEN WE CAN ALL THERE'S A- FOR YOU THE COURTHOUSE OR THERE'S A- IN LEGAL A- OR WE SAY NO. GOT SELF HELP AND HE HELPS AND WILL BE THREAT AND IF YOU. SEE AND- YOU KNOW IN PACKED AND EVERYTHING THAT WE GIVE THEM TO THEM THE PROP AS. FOR US WE'RE. FORMATION THAT THEY HAVE THEN WE CAN BUILD ON THAT- AND- CAPTURE THE REST OF IT. AND THAT'S GREAT AND IT SHOULD WE AND JUDGE BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUGGEST COUNSEL BUT ALSO TRYING TO MANAGE A COURT. ARE THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING HARDER AT FROM RULES AND PROCEDURES AND OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZING. AND WHERE WE'VE COME WITH THE REALITY IS. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DOES IS THEY TRY TO MAKE THE FORMS EASIER AND SIMPLER TO FOLLOW BECAUSE- ESPECIALLY. FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO LOOK AT SOME OF THESE FORMS AND YOU. JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TRYING TO MAKE THE FORMS. EASY TO UNDERSTAND I CALL IT SIMPLE ENGLISH. SO THAT WHEN YOU READ IT IT MAKES SENSE IT'S NOT LEGAL JARGON THAT PEOPLE JUST REALLY HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING. SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING THAT AND WORKING WITH. THE COUNTY LAW LIBRARY THERE ARE PARTNER AND WE LOOK TO THEM TO HELP US WITH THESE FORMS AND- PUT THESE FORMS OUT FOR A CUP PUBLIC COMMENT. BEFORE WE ADOPT THE RULES BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SO THAT WE HAVE CLEAR FORMS THAT'S WHY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE GUIDING FILE WERE YOU GO ONLINE AND- I SHOWED YOU ARE EMPLOYED JEANETTE SHE WALKS YOU THROUGH THE FORM. OF A LOT OF TIMES IT'S DIFFICULT FROM LEGAL ASPECT BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PHRASEOLOGY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE TERMS. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT CERTAIN THE MEANING. OF WEEK SIMPLIFY IT AND IF YOU GO ON OUR WEBSITE THEY'LL BASICALLY ASK YOU GIVE YOU PROPS CERTAIN QUESTIONS. SO YOU KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT. JUST UNDERSTANDING IN ITS HEART I MEAN I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN A- GOOD FROM TWENTY SO AND I SEE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS. SO SOMEONE WOULD NEVER BEEN THE LAW SCHOOL EVEN CALL OR MAYBE GRABBED HIGH SCHOOL IT'S AND- DIFFICULT VERY CONFUSING. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON. ADVERSE HE'S. IT'S ALL. ON UP THAT IF YOU DON'T GET EVERYTHING A- RIGHT. A BECOME SORT OF A GOTCHA FOR THE SIDE. CAN HAVE NOW YOU HAVE A UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS. WHO A LEGITIMATE. THE HE DOES THEY DON'T KNOW. THE JAR THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE CASE OUGHT AND WHY. THAT WORDING IS DONE EXACT THE WAY THAT IS THAT THEN BECOMES A GOTCHA TO SOMEBODY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO TRAP. IN THAT SITUATION RIGHT IN AS THAT IS THE REALITY THAN LAWYERS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO MAKE SURE IT'S LEGALLY PROPER THE FORMS. THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR THAT THE PROCESS WORKS. BUT MAKING SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT AND HOW THEY FIT IN. AND WHAT THEY NEED TO SAY AND GET IT RIGHT. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AND THAT'S WHERE ALL OF US HAVE TO WORK AS A TEAM. MA'AM GOOD DOCTOR WEB MA'AM YOU'RE JUST WANTED TO- AND I IT'S AN AS A AS I'M LIST BECAUSE I THINK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT MATTER IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS VERY CLEAR FOR THE LAY PERSON VERSUS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE. THE PERSON DID NOT UNDERSTAND. AND THEY SPOKE ENGLISH THEY JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THE TERMINOLOGY USED BY THE LAWYER OR THE JUDGE- WAS JUST SO DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES LAWYERS GET IN A CIRCLE NOW TALK THE SAME THING I WAS MAYOR TO ONCE THEY ALL. GOT THE SAME THING. AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF INTERPRETATION FOR MY KIDS SO THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FATHER WAS SAYING WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE. BUT IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER JUST DIFFICULT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS VERY CLEAR TO THEM. SO I'M GLAD THAT THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF THAT BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETIMES THE GREATEST BERRY WE THINK. SB KEYS BECAUSE EVERYONE'S QUOTE SPEAKS ENGLISH THAT THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND AND THEY DON'T. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE TRY TO DO ON THE PROVIDING ACCESS AND PARENTS COMMITTEES AND LOOK AT THESE FORMS. AND SAY YOU KNOW CAN THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO HAS AMEND THE LAW SCHOOL HAS A- MINIMAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATION UNDERSTAND. HOW TO GET FROM QUEST AND WANT TO QUESTION FIFTEEN. ON THIS FORM THANKS THEY CAN THEN THE FORM NOT WORKING YEAH SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON. HOW DIVERSE IS THE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU HAVE WORKING AND ALL THAT SO FOR JUSTICE COURT FOR. ALL THE MAJORITY OF THE K ÃI COLUMN KIDS BUT- COLLEGE- ARE LATINO HISPANIC. WE HAVE ABOUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT THIRTY SOME ODD PERCENT. OF THE THREE HUNDRED. LATINO HISPANIC THERE'S ABOUT ANOTHER. AT FIFTEEN AND 19% OF ASIAN ABOUT KIND OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO. GET PEOPLE. IN JUSTICE CORPS WHO LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE THEY'RE GOING TO BE DRIVING. BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW ACCESS. IN MAKING THINGS MEANINGFUL IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT EASIER WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU. WHETHER IT'S A JUDGE OF ATTORNEY- SOMEONE WHO'S HELPING YOU AT A SELF CENTER. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE SO WHEN YOU COME THE LA YOU'LL SEE. WE HAVE A LOT OF DIVERSITY. I LIKE TO CALL IT WE GOT GREAT INCLUSION. BECAUSE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. THAT MAKES IT. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE MMHM. TO HAVE THAT SO WEEKS WORK VERY HARD. WHEN WE'RE PICKING OUR OWN COURT STAFF. I KNOW I DO IT WHEN I'M PICKING JUDGES. GOING CERTAIN COMMITTEES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LOOK LIKE. THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE. AND MOST OF FRAZIER SERVING OUR AND BROWN. BLACK AND BROWN I MEAN LET ME KNOW THE LAW. POPPY IN HERE I CAN. FOLLOWED BY A- I THEN AND ARE IN THE- BUT I MEAN THE ONES THAT ARE INTO CO WAS THAT ARE. IN THE MASS THE POPULAR THE MUCH. ARE LATINO AFRICAN. AGE OKAY WE MAINLY SO. THAT PROBABLY TO THIRDS. OF WHO WE HAVE TO HELP. AND THEY'RE PROBABLY. I MEAN THEY'RE DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS OF HIM WITH HER ILL. SO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY AMONG OUR STAFF. AND DIVERSITY IN THE JUSTICE CORPS MEMBERS AND QUITE FRANKLY WHAT WE HAVE DIVERT. ON OUR BENCH. OKAY OKAY ARE GOOD. I ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE I GET OF. I IN OUR WORLD WE GIVE CAUGHT UP IN MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE LANGUAGE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED. AT OF A LOT OF AFRICAN. CONSTITUENTS WERE ANGRY BECAUSE THEY GO AND THEY SEE NO ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE THEM IN SOME COURTS AND MAYBE NOT IN LA. BUT THE OTHER PLACES IN AND PEOPLE SAY BUT WE HAVE TO MEET THE LANGUAGE NEEDS. AND AS A RESULT IN MILLIMETERS L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G NEEDS TO.&lt;/c&gt; ALIENATED LEFT OUT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE PROBABLY. PERCENT PEOPLE SHOWING UP IN COURT IN SOME AREAS A MORE RIGHT THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THERE'S NO ON THE LIKE THEM. WE'VE GOT TO MEET THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G IN THE YET&lt;/c&gt; THOSE ALL HAVE A SO. NUMBER OF LÃNG YOU NEED TO. OF WHAT WE CALL IN FOR. RIGHT OF VERSES DID JUST ENGLISH SO THAT BECOMES A MAJOR SO. JUST WANNA SURE WHAT KIND OF. AWARE OF THAT AS WE TO ABOUT. JEFF AND PEOPLE FEEL. GOOD WHEN THEY COME IN WHEN THEY LEAVE. YEAH THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO. AND GOT THE- THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY HAVE ME I ALWAYS. YOU KNOW DIVERSE INCLUDES IS SORT. AND THAT'S WHY. WE HAVE THE PROVIDING A- AND FOR COMMITTEE TO MAKE. THEIR HOME OF THE JUDICIAL. BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THE- COME UP WILL DO YOU MEAN. WHAT IS VERSUS INCLUSION IS NOT MENTIONING. THE CHANCE OF TO. THE CURRENT AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING. AND MAKING SHORT THAT EQUAL. TO JUSTICE ME SOMETHING. AND PURSE. IS REALITY PEOPLE WHO ARE SO IF YOU DON'T PURSUE. THE. BETTER YOU OR YOUR HAD.

THAT ISN'T REALLY FAIRNESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE WANT TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT IT'S THE BEST PRACTICE WHAT OF THE MODEL PROGRAMS. AND TRY TO GET THAT TO EVERY COUNTY IN IN CALIFORNIA. SEVEN SEVEN POINT THANK YOU. INTO YOUR POOR. DOES RESULT. ABOUT THE WORK YOU'VE DONE DIVERSITY THAT'S GREAT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BENCH OF THE BAR IN CALIFORNIA.

THESE COMMITTEES THIS HEARING. ON THIS TOPIC PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND WE HAVE A BACK PHONE IN THE MIDDLE THAT. IS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU. I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BECAUSE I REALIZE READ THE NOON HOUR I'M FEELING A COUPLE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND I WANTED TO THINK- CHAIR STONE OF COURSE DOCTOR WEBER FOR YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA. I AM. SO LACK OF THE OVER ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO LONG CALIFORNIANS WHETHER THEY'RE FUNDED BY THE STATE BAR. AND ALSO THOSE THAT DON'T RECEIVE STATE BAR FUNDING. AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDING FOR INCREASED REPRESENTATION IS OF COURSE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE. AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE- ACCESS PROBLEM IS MUCH BIGGER. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS TODAY FROM ALL THE PANELISTS HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COURT RESOURCES. INCLUDING AT ACCESS INTERPRETERS IN COURT REPORTERS. AND ALSO THE MENTION THE LAST PANEL ABOUT THE NEED FOR. AN IMPROVED COURT PROCESSES AND IMPROVE COURT FORMS THERE'S JUST A LOT THAT. A REGULAR LITIGATE CANNOT% UNDERSTAND UNLESS AN ATTORNEY. TO REPRESENT SO YOU JUST CAN'T. NEED TO SOME. PROCESSES THE LAWYERS ARE NOT. TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL SYSTEM. TO THE BACKGROUND PAPER OF COURSE I AM VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND HAVE LITTLE TO ADD OTHER THAN WISHING TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE. OF COLLABORATION AND HIS BODY SAID IN A PRIOR PANEL PRIOR TO THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THERE WAS A LOT MORE. COORDINATION A LOT MORE OFFICIAL COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION THAT HAPPENED AND WHEN FUNDING SHRUNK A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS AGENCIES TURNED ON THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO- WORK ON THEIR OWN STAFFING IN THEIR OWN CLIENT SERVICES. AND WE HAVE NOT YET READ THE TIME WERE WERE CLASS. REALLY THE OTHER. AND I WOULD. THE DOES CAN INCREASED FIVE. SO AS THIS TO COMMIT WORK INCREASE. FUNDING FOR JUST A SYSTEM THINK THE CALL. WILL CONTINUE AND I THINK ANY BRIDGMAN. AN IMPORTANT. AND THEN I JUST. FOR THE GET THE BOAT IS TO FIND. THANK YOU.
