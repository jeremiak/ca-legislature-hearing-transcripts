MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. AT FORTINO THREE AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY DUE TO A PLANNED. THE ENERGY STATION EVENT MEMBERS AS WE KNOW UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN ISSUING PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. AS A TOOL TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK DURING WEATHER EVENTS WERE POORLY MAINTAINED ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION LINES. COULD CAUSE A WILDFIRE IN TWENTY NINETEEN A SERIES OF MISMANAGING POORLY PLANNED PS PS EVENTS IMPACTED MILLIONS OF PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS. AND SENT STATE OFFICIALS SCRAMBLING TO RESPOND TO NUMEROUS PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS FROM THE PLANNED POWER OUTAGE. BECAUSE THE PS PS WAS A PLANNED OUTAGE THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF WAS FORCED TO WAIT. FOR OTHER SYSTEMIC FAILURES TO OCCUR BEFORE BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY RESOURCES AND ASSIST COMMUNITIES THAT WERE LITERALLY. LEFT IN THE DARK. THIS IS. EIGHTY FORTY THREE WILL INCREASE THE STATE'S PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS BY GIVING THE GOVERNOR EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY RESULTING FROM A PS PS EVENT. AND ALLOW THE STATE TO PRE DEPLOY RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROTECT HEALTH SAFETY AND PROPERTY OF RESIDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE SEASON IS ALREADY UNDERWAY AND IS EXPECTED TO BE ONE OF THE WORST IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. EIGHTY FORTY THREE IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR BROADER WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS THAT WILL HELP PROTECT PROPERTY AND LIVES THIS FIRE SEASON AND FOR FIRE SEASONS TO COME.

AND DO YOU INTEND TO ACCEPT THOSE AS AUTHOR CEMENT YES THAT'S RIGHT YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHURCH AS I STATED IN THE BEGINNING OF MY- MY- PRESENTATION- IBM BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS- AND I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT PART IN POINT TO MAKE PARTICULARLY TO. WITNESSES TESTIMONY TODAY IS THAT MY BILL AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IN AS IT WAS PASSED OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY INCLUDE BOTH LOCAL EVENTS AND LOCAL STATES OF EMERGENCY. AND A STATE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO HAS AUTHORED SB FIFTY TWO IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS VOTED ON SB FIFTY TWO ALREADY. HIS BILL FOCUSES ON THE LOCAL EMERGENCY AND SO WE NEGOTIATED THAT MY BILL WILL FOCUS ON THE STATEWIDE- OR THE STATE'S ABILITY THE GOVERNOR'S ABILITY I DON'T SEE HER EMERGENCY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND I SEE NO MICROPHONES UP TO ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONSCOMMENTS. THERE WE ARE IN THE BACK THIS LETTER TO GLACIER HAPPY TO MOVE IT ABILITY FOR EVERY TIME A SECURE IN ROOM. PARDON. THE IN. A CHAMBER MEMBER WHAT DID YOU HAVE A ANOTHER LEAD WITNESS ON THIS. BILL YEAH THERE WERE TWO WITNESSES I BELIEVE WE DID HEAR FROM JOHN KENNEDY FROM RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE ONE FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES- JULIA HALL- THAT HAD BEEN- I DISSIPATED BY THE MODERATOR. DID ANYBODY ELSE THE MODERATOR IN Q. I AM ON THE LINE BUT I COULD KNOCK YOU OUT THIS IS JULIA HOLIDAY VACATION CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE ON THE LIST DIDN'T TESTIFY WOULD YOU PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JULIE HALL AT THE DIVISION OF CALIFORNIA ARE YOU CAN CAN WE ARE AT FOURTEEN AT THREE REALLY I THINK THE POWER SHUT OFF AND- IN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NIXON DECLARED A STATEWIDE EMERGENCY DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIGH WIND EVENT. EVENTS THAT RESULTED IN FIRES AND EVACUATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S INVESTOR OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED YES YES AND THEN. HELP ENSURE THEIR CLINIC DOES NOT START A WILDFIRE HE DID AND CAN LEAVE MANY CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDING WATER AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES WITHOUT POWER FOR DAYS AT A TIME. DURING THESE EVENTS WATER AND WASTE WATER PROVIDERS INCREASE SIGNIFICANT UNBUDGETED COSTS TO ENSURE CONTINUED WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES PROVIDED CENTRAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY SERVICES. THE CALIFORNIA VERSION TWO SERVICES ACT PROVIDES THAT LOCAL AGENCIES CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR PERSONNEL COSTS QUITMAN COSTS AND THE COST OF SUPPLIES MATERIALS. USED DURING DISASTER RESPONSE ACTIVITIES ENCOURAGE WHEN IT EMERGES CLAIMED. UNDER EXISTING LAW THE ANNOTATION EVENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF CONDITIONS THAT CONSTITUTE A STATE OF EMERGENCY. THEREFORE COSTS ACCRUED DURING AN EVENT DO NOT QUALIFY THE BILL WOULD HELP REMEDY THAT ISSUE BY ADDING PLANNED THE EDUCATION EVENT BUT WITH THE CONDITION. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE FOLLOWING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THIS MORNING AND THANK. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MESSAGE HERE WE DO HAVE PEOPLE TO SPEAK OPPOSITION WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WHEN YOU PROCEED WITH YOUR OPPOSITION WITNESSES. THANK YOU MR CHAIR LINE NUMBER FOURTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. SHE SAID MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DID ENOUGH LEMMINGS ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY- UNFORTUNATELY WE DO OPPOSE AB FORTINO THREE- WHILE PG&amp;E APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS INCURRED FROM RUNNING EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTERS DURING PS PSP BENT. WE BELIEVE AT FOURTEEN OH THREE WHICH HINDER P. GENIES ABILITY TO SEE COST RECOVERY FOR OPERATION AND RECOVERY DURING THIS TIME AND THEN- EXITED BY THE EXPEDITED COST RECOVERY ALLOWS US. TO CONTINUOUSLY RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES WHILE LIMITING THE IMPACT TO ITS BASE OPERATIONS INCLUDING SAFE RELIABLE AND AFFORDING PORTABLE SERVICE- BY MAKING A PS PSP BENT AND EMERGENCY THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BLOCK. R. P. G. P. G. ANY USE OF THE EXPEDITED COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS AND COULD FORCE US TO RELY ON OTHER COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS THAT CAN TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE- AGAIN WE- SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY THEN HE TO. DO THESE ACTIVITIES HOWEVER- WE MUST OPPOSE. AB FOURTEEN OH THREE THANK YOU. ONE MORE REMINDER PLEASE RETURN AS A REMINDER PLEASE TAKE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT. LINE NUMBER ELEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING THIS IS LAURA CARLA THIRTY CALIFORNIA AND THEN IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT DEMANDED A WHILE HE AGREES WITH THE BILL'S INTENDED TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL RETURNS TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESPOND TO PIA PIA THANKS WITHOUT CHANGES TO ADDRESS CERTAIN AND I'M INTENDED CONSEQUENCES- EMERGENCY DECLARATION FOR PS TEETH COULD TRIGGER SEVERAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR MAJOR DISASTERS- WE BELIEVE THAT THAT- BUT THERE COULD BE A BANK AND- THE FIRST BEING. THAT TYPE OF AMENDMENT. TO BETTER ALIGN WITH. THE FIFTY TWO YEAR FOR THOSE RETURN OF THE REMAINING POSTMARKS THEN IT YOU. BLIND TWELVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE AHEAD. GOOD MORNING CAN MAKE ME CLEAN AND THEN IT'S ATTENDING ON GAS AND ELECTRIC ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ACT TO REMOVE THE TERMS THAT THE ANNOTATION EVENT FROM GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION- EIGHT FIVE FIVE EIGHT THE END RECOUNTED IN TWO EIGHT FIVE FIVE EIGHT HE FOR THE REASON BEING THAT IT WOULD TRIGGER THE PC. REGULATIONS THAT ARE INTENDED FOR MAJOR CATCH CATCH CATCH YOUR FEES- IN SUPPORT OF CUSTOMER THAN THAT WITHOUT GIVING UP THAT WOULD CREATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COSTS YEAH WE APPRECIATE THE OTHER CONCERNS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH HIM. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE. LOOKING UP IN THE COMPUTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. IN THAT. AT THE TIME WE HAVE NO ONE NO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. RIGHT BUT CANADA JONES HAS HIS MICROPHONE UP SENATOR JONES WILL COMING BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- MR LEVINE I'M REALLY CONFLICTED. IN A MINUTE M. I'M IN AN AREA OF THE STATE WHERE YEAH MY DISTRICT IS SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS. AND YOU KNOW MY AREA THE UTILITIES I THINK DONE A PRETTY DECENT JOB OF. PREPARING THEIR FACILITIES AND YOU HAVE WEATHER STATIONS ALL OVER MY DISTRICT- BUT TO PUT THE IT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN WHEN WE MAKE THIS A STATE OF EMERGENCY ON PS P. S. IT CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE OTHER RATE PAYERS- SOMEBODY'S PAYING THE BILL AND SO SOMEBODY'S GETTING TWELVE MONTHS OFF OF PAYING THEIR THEIR BUILDINGS YOU KNOW. THE OTHER REPAIRS ARE MAKING THAT UP. AND SO. I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE IS AS A PS PS YOU'VE BEEN. WHY WOULD A PS PS EVENT DESIGNED TO PREVENT WILDFIRES NECESSITATE THE SAME TWELVE MONTH LONG RESPONSE AS AN EMERGENCY EVENT SUCH AS A FIRE OR EARTHQUAKE. OR FLOOD EVEN AND AS I SAID IS IT THE SWITCHES IT SHIFTS THE COSTS OF THE OTHER REPAIRS. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR JONES FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND- AND I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ACTORS SOME SOME UTILITIES THAT HAVE PERFORMED BETTER OVER THE PAST DECADE TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR- THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW THAN OTHERS. THE DISTINCTION ISN'T- IT. IT I THINK THAT YOU MEET TO SOON TO- AND THIS ISN'T A CRITICISM OF YOU I THINK IT'S EASY EASY MAKE- ABOUT THESE DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS. PARTICULARLY ON- SOME RATE FREEZES- THAT ARE. NOT THAT MANY STEPS HAVE TO BE MADE TO GET TO THAT THE FIRST IS OF COURSE WE ARE ONLY MAKING PS PS EVENTS AT AN EVENT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY BY A GOVERNOR IF THAT GOVERNOR DETERMINES THAT THAT IS NECESSARY BY THE EVENT AND THE- CASCADING EVENTS AFFECTED BY THAT EVENT SO GOVERNORS DON'T CALL STATES OF EMERGENCY WOULD GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF MOST RECENTLY OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S DECLARATIONS OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY AROUND A DROUGHT. WHERE HE VERY QUICKLY ARE NOT VERY QUICKLY BUT BUT- EARLIER DECLARED THAT TWO COUNTIES WE'RE IN A DROUGHT AND HAD A STATE OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE- IN SEDONA TWO COUNTIES OF WHICH- MARIN RECEIVES WATER FROM- BESIDES OUR OWN LOCAL RESERVOIRS MARIN COUNTY HAS DECLARED ITSELF IN A DROUGHT BUT YET THE GOVERNOR HAS NOT DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY IN MARIN SO THAT'S YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF A ANALOGY OF GOVERNORS DO WITH THEIR OWN COURSE OF DETERMINATION TO GET TO A VERY SERIOUS- NAMING OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO I WOULD IMAGINE. THAT IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT COST RECOVERY ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE- IF WE WANT WANTED TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS BECAUSE OF SOME EVENT TRIGGERED BY A P. S. P. S. THAT MIGHT BE WHERE A GOVERNOR WOULD BE STEPPING. IN IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COST ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE CALL. CENTER RUBIO. I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- AND I WANT TO JUST- TO SHARE SOME OF MY CONCERNS BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH. ABOUT THE BILL BUT I HAD TALKED TO THE AUTHOR AND I'VE HAD VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT THAT THE NUANCES OF THE SPELL I KNOW THAT P. S. P. S. VENTS HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND I CAN SEE WHY THIS BILL IS NEEDED BUT- THERE'S A FEW CONCERNS AND I WANTED JUST TO STAY FOR THE RECORD THAT I. NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME FOR RESEARCH SINCE WE JUST TRANSITIONED FROM IBM AND OF HEALTH OF ORIGIN AND THIS NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE VETTING AND MY PERSONAL OPINION FOR ME PERSONALLY BUT I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYMORE MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK QUESTIONS OR TESTIFY WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A CENTER GLACIER. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- IT SEEMS I MEAN I ALSO HAVE A DISTRICT THAT'S- HAS STRUGGLED THROUGH THESE P. S. P. S. EVENTS IN AND A PART OF THIS BILL AND SO MANY OTHER BILLS THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH IN THE SPACES TO CRY TO CREATE. THE INCENTIVE MOTIVATION WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT FOR THE UTILITIES TO HARDEN THEIR SYSTEMS IN A WAY THAT- VOICE THESE EVENTS EVEN HAPPENING I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL HERE SO I RECOGNIZE THERE MIGHT BE SOME POTENTIAL BURDEN. ON UTILITIES FROM THIS LEGISLATION THAT'S IT FOR ME IT SEEMS LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR THE GOVERNOR HE CONTINUES OUR OUR WORK TO TRY TO CREATE THESE DISINCENTIVES TO NOT INVEST IN THAT COST MONEY FOR TO RATE PAYERS TO THESE EVENTS COST MONEY- SO WE'RE ALL TRYING TO WORK- YOU KNOW. FOR THE BOAT IN THE RIGHT IN THE SAME DIRECTION MAYBE IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS BUT I THINK THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT. WITH THAT AND HAPPY TO MOVE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR. ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO COMMENT. SHADING NINE THEN. THERE SHOULD BE A MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO THEN GIVE US A FINAL PLUNGE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO ALL THE SENATORS FOR THE THOUGHTFUL DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION SENATOR GLAZER ESENTIALLY GAVE MY CLOTHES- BEAUTIFULLY SAID THE POINT IS NOT NEVER TO HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY NEVER EVEN HAVE A P. S. . S. THE POINT IS TO HAVE. AN INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT- WE CAN TURN ON THE LIGHTS KEEP THE FOOD IN OUR REFRIGERATOR- COLD AS IT'S NEEDED. AND IN IN IN HI WEATHER EVENTS NO THAT- OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WILL NOT FAIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION RESPECT ASPIRIN I GO. DO WE HAVE A MOTION.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOSER RETREAT REFRESH WILL BE PRESENTING THE BILL ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHOW BACK TO H. PLEASE PROCEED FAMILY MEMBER THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SENATORS- AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IS A COMMITTEE BILL FROM THE ASSEMBLY JOBS COMMITTEE IT ENHANCES THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO PROSECUTE FRAUDULENT CONTRACTING ACTIVITY INCREASES COLLABORATION AMONG SMALL BUSINESS AND D. V. B. E. ADVOCATES AND PROVIDES MORE TARGETED SUPPORT TOOL WARDING DEPARTMENTS IN ACHIEVING SMALL BUSINESS AND TV B. E. PROCUREMENT PARTICIPATION GOALS. ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE BILL WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS DISCUSSIONS WITH STATE CONTRACTING STAFF AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STATE AUDIT. OF THE D. V. B. E. PROCUREMENT PROGRAM. WITH ME TODAY- OUR NUMBER OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT INCLUDING FELLOW VERMAELEN COAL FROM THE COALITION FOR SMALL AND DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES. AND SLASHER BARRICADE ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. DO DO DO YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST WITNESS A MODERATOR CAN YOU PUT THE FIRST WITH MAX. YOUR LINE IS OPEN THERE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS PHIL VERMAELEN I REPRESENT A COALITION OF SMALL DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESSES WHY SHOULD TO THE SITUATION AS WELL. MISS U. ZERO I'M STRONG SUPPORT THIS MEASURE- I SIT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY TASK FORCE. AND THIS MEASURE CONTAINS MANY PROVISIONS IN IT THAT- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT FOR EXAMPLE- ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT MANY SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF CITY CALIFORNIA HAVE. REACHING OUT TO THE VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND BUREAUS THAT ARE A LEADING CONTRACTS AND TRYING TO ASCERTAIN INFORMATION TO HELP THEM. PARTICIPATE IN THE BIDDING PROCESS- THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE WILL WORK TO DEVELOP A LIST OF- LIAISONS WITH ALL OF THE STATE AGENCIES SO THAT THESE SMALL BUSINESSES WILL HAVE A RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS TO FIND OUT THAT SHIPPING INFORMATION. ANOTHER INTERESTING IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH A DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE IS- YOU KNOW THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF D. V. D. V. POTENTIAL BUSINESSES THAT COULD BE PARTICIPATING IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER THEY HAVE DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO BE PROPERLY NEED AND AGAIN- THE SMALL OUT MORE WITH THE D. V. B. E. ADVOCATE. THEY WILL BE WORKING ON DEVELOPING ACCESS FOR OUT REACH FOR THESE- VERY EXPEDIENCY'S. OTHER BIG PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE GAMING OF THE SYSTEM WE HAVE- PLEASE PROTECT PREFERENCE PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF BIGGER AGE. THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN GAMING THE SYSTEM BY PROVIDING- SMALL BUSINESSES UP THAT THEY CAN ENABLE THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PREFERENCE PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO STOP THIS IT IS GAMING THE SYSTEM FOR BILLY AND- THERE ARE. NOW THROUGH THIS MEASURE THAT WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE IN THE BAD ACTORS IN THE PROGRAM SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT. FINALLY THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE TARGET AREA CONTACT PREFERENCES ACCESS. THE CONTAINS TWO PROVISIONS AND IT WONDERS WORKSITE THING COURAGE'S- BUSINESSES TO LOCATE THEIR BUSINESSES IN.
