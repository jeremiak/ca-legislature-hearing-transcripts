SEVENTY I SENATOR BASS. PLEASE. KILEY COME UP AND JOIN US. AND AGAIN THIS IS FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE S. B. SEVENTY. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. WELCOME. GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LA PLACEMENT TO BE HERE FORGOT ABOUT HOW BIG THIS REMAINS SO HERE KIND OF FAR AWAY THAT. GOOD GOOD AUDIO OFFERS I WANT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AS AMENDED. SORRY. AS AMENDED S. B. SEVENTY IS A VERY NARROW BILL THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS FOR A CLIENT TO SHERRY RESTRICTED APPRAISAL REPORT WAS SPECIFIC RECIPIENTS SOUGHT RISK RECENT MMS ADDED A SUNSET DATE. OF JANUARY OFFERS TWENTY TWENTY AND A SPECIAL DISCLOSURE PROVISION TO CLARIFY THE REPORTS ARE SHORTENED AND DO NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION FROM THE APPRAISERS WORK FILE. OUR THIS EXEMPTION WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED FOR A FEDERALLY RELATED TRANSACTION A LOAN A REFINANCE ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OR LOAN OF INVESTOR FUNDS ARRANGED BY MORTGAGE BROKER. AS SUCH THE REPORTS THAT WILL ONLY GO TO CLIENTS WHO REQUEST RESTRICTED APPRAISAL REPORTS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT NEED TO. FULL APPRAISAL REPORTS THIS IS A VERY SMALL POPULATION. MIGHT MELODIOUS HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE APPRAISAL INSTITUTE THE LARGEST APPRAISAL OF ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION. AND ULTIMATELY S. B. SEVENTY ENSURES THAT MORE CONSUMERS ARE USING LICENSED APPRAISERS AND LOWER COSTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER BELOW IS HERE TO. ANSWER THOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MIKE BILLOWED ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNENT RELATIONS COMMITTEE OF THE APPRAISAL INSTITUTE IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN THAT GROUPS COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE AND ASK FOR PERMISSION. TO SELL AND LESS EXPENSIVE STREAMLINED PRODUCT. THE REASON WHY WE'RE DOING THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS CONSUMER DEMAND FOUR SHORTENED APPRAISAL REPORTS THAT ARE NOT INVOLVED IN FEDERALLY RELATED TRANSACTIONS. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THE UNIFORM STANDARDS OF PROFESSIONAL APPRAISAL PRACTICE TO WHICH ALL LICENSEES MUST COMPLY AND THAT IS THEY CAN DO A RESTRICTED REPORT BUT ONLY IF IT ONLY HAS ONE INTENDED USER. SO FINALLY APPRAISAL APPRAISER AND I WANT TO DO A RESTRICTED REPORT FOR YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I FIND OUT IT IS FOR YOU AND YOUR LAWYER OR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. YOU AND THE IRS CAN'T DO IT. ONLY EXEMPTION FROM THE UNIFORM STANDARDS IN THIS BILL IS TO ALLOW MORE THAN ONE INTENDED USER. WHEN THERE IS CONSENT BY THE CLIENT SO IT ALLOWS A LICENSED APPRAISER TO RESPOND TO CONSUMER DEMAND. WE PUT LOTS OF PROTECTIONS IN THERE INCLUDING WORKING WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

SMART MAN THAT ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE PODIUM AND WILL ALLOW YOU UP TO. THREE MINUTES GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DAVID PACE I AM THE LEGISLATIVE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INSPECTION ASSOCIATION. AND I'M A HOME INSPECTOR. VERY BRIEFLY. CREA IS SUPPOSED TO THIS BILL FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WE BELIEVE IT. INAPPROPRIATELY PLACES INTO LAW NOTIFICATION. MANDATE ON HOME INSPECTORS THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY. THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY MANUFACTURES TO EDUCATE AND INFORM THEIR CUSTOMERS REGARDING THEIR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE IT INAPPROPRIATELY PLACES AND A LOT A MANDATE THAT A HOME INSPECTOR PLACE. IN HIS OR HERREPORT THE BELIEF. THAT MANUFACTURERS OF MANUFACTURERS THE TUBING IS SAFER. IF PROPERLY BONDED AND GROUNDED WE BELIEVE IT INAPPROPRIATELY PLACES INTO LAW A REQUIREMENT THAT HOME INSPECTORS. IN EFFECT RECOMMEND THAT A LICENSED ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR BE ENGAGED. TO CONFIRM PROPER BONDING AND GROUNDING WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS IN MY TO. IS PREMATURE. AND THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE RESEARCH. ON THE PART OF THE MANUFACTURERS. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE AGREEMENT AMONG. THE. FOLKS THAT WRITE THE VARIOUS CODES. SO FOR THAT REASON. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. I'D LIKE TO. INTRODUCE SKIP WALKER. I SKIP WALKER I'M OUT HOME INSPECTOR CREA MEMBER. ALSO GNASHING MEMBER WHICH IS AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HOME INSPECTORS BELONG TO. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL INSPECTORS. AMONG OTHER THINGS AYE AYE RIGHT OF. OUR CO AUTHOR A BOOK ON ELECTRICAL CODE SO I WOULD SAY I HAVE MORE THAN A PASSING KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT FUNDING AND GROUNDING IS I HAPPEN TO. BE EXAMINED AND IF HE A MEMBER ALSO THEY WRITE THE ELECTRIC CODE IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED I I ACTUALLY ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE SILENT ON THE ISSUE OF BONDING OF CSS T.. THE RESPONSE I RECEIVED AND I'M GONNA PARAPHRASE SAID DON DURING THE TWENTY ELEVEN CODE CYCLE. CHO PANEL FIVE REJECTED A PROPOSAL THE ROAD RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR A CSS T.. THE PANEL STATEMENT SUPPORTING THE REJECTION PROPOSAL SAID CMP FIVE IS NOT CONVINCED THE BONDING TO AROUND PORTIONS OF CSS T.. WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM NO TEST RECORDS WERE PROVIDED TO SUBSTANTIATE THE ADEQUACY. OF THE. THE REQUIRED BONDING THE PROBLEM COULD BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE DESIGN AND WALL THICKNESS OF CSS T.. THE PURPOSE OF THE ENEMIES NEC WHICH IS THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC CODE IS THE PRACTICAL SAFEGUARDING OF PERSONS PROPERTY FROM HAZARDS ARISING FROM THE USE OF ELECTRICITY. WHAT THAT MEANS IN PLAIN PLAIN ENGLISH IS THAT? BONDING THE PURPOSE OF BONDING IS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THINGS THAT THEY DO INSIDE THE HOUSE. I HAVE A COLLEAGUE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AND THIS IS THE WRITTEN RESPONSE WHICH IS SORT OF WHAT THEY HAVE FOR PUBLICATION. TENS OF THE LIBERAL RESPONSE WAS SIMPLY THAT. WE BOND FOR ELECTRICAL SAFETY NOT FOR LIGHTNING. AND THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE NOT CORRECT STATEMENT AND THEY. THEY FURTHER ACTUALLY SAID THAT. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A PRODUCT MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ADDRESSING THAT. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL VIDEO NINE AS IT SOUNDS THE OTHER TIMES THAT SENATE TURNING LATER ON WILL. WILL SAY THAT ARE REASONABLY. HOME INSPECTORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. SIR. THANK YOU SO THAT YOU VERY MUCH YOUR TIME'S UP THANK YOU MIGHT MUCH APPRECIATED. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT MRS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME TO MIKE AT NAME INFLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO STEVE CAROLINE INCOMING A TERM OF THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE INSPECTED SO SOON LAWSUIT ALSO HOME INSPECTOR IN A POST. YES MY NAME IS JOHN TO MOTION I MCCREA CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE INSPECTION ASSOCIATION HOME INSPECTOR I'M ALSO AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HOME INSPECTORS. AND I AM IN COMPLETE OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL AS WELL AS OUR REGION EIGHT WHICH REPRESENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE HOME INSPECTORS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM OF QUESTION FOR BOTH THE. THE PRO AND THE CON. AND IN CENTER GALGIANI MAYBE YOU YOU CAN ADDRESS HURT THAT DETERMINES YOUR WITNESSES A BETTER BUT. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT LED THAT YOU WHAT WHAT INSPIRED THIS WAS THERE WAS THERE ARE A TERRIBLE SOMETIMES WE HEAR ABOUT TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS AND. AND SOME. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? WHAT HAPPENED? THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER THE ANSWER IS YES. THERE HAVE BEEN. A UNFORTUNATELY THERE HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED DEATHS. AS A RESULT OF OF THE PROBLEM THAT THIS BILLS TRYING TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE RESULTED IN. OF FIRE AND DEATH. FROM CSS T. YELLOW CSS TEETH A TUBING THAT WASN'T PROPERLY BONDED AND GROUNDED. OTHER HAVE BEEN OTHER INCIDENTS THAT DIDN'T RESULT IN DEATH BUT IT WAS AS A RESULT OF THIS THAT THE INDUSTRY STEPPED UP. AND WORK WITH THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF STATE LEGISLATURES TO COME UP WITH MODEL LANGUAGE BUT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHICH IS A NOTIFICATION ISSUE SO THAT HOMEOWNERS WHEN THEY'RE BUYING A HOUSE. ARE AWARE THAT YOU LOOK TO BECAUSE IN THE HOUSE WHAT THE PROPER PROCEDURE IS TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROPERLY BONDED. THE LEGISLATION NOT THAT UNNECESSARY MATTERS HERE CALIFORNIA WITHOUT MODEL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PASSED IN FOUR STATES THE STATE OF TEXAS. THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA THE STATE OF VIRGINIA AND THE STATE OF MARYLAND. THERE WAS NO ORGANIZED OPPOSITION OUGHT TO THE SAME LEGISLATION IN THOSE FOUR STATES. JUST SO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW WE HAVE BEEN SINCE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN COMMUNICATION AND WORKING WITH CREE UP WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. OF WE DID ACTUALLY TAKE AN AMENDMENT IN THE SENATE OUGHT TO ADDRESS THE LIABILITY ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED BUT A NUMBER OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION OF RACE OR ISSUES THAT ARE GERMANE TO THE PARTICULAR BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. UP SO WELL BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO OF WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. BUT THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS NOT WITH THE SPUR. BUT INCIDENTS. THAT. STARTED THIS PROCESS THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT BACKGROUND AND THEN TO THE OPPOSITION. OF I MADE THE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE. THE REASONABLY PRUDENT STANDARD IS COMMON IN THE LAW. MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE IS A STANDARD FOR DETERMINING IF REASONABLE APPROPRIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN A SPECIAL AND SOME HAS A DUTY OF CARE. AND I DO BELIEVE I'LL BE SURPRISED IF YOU WOULD DENY THAT HOME INSPECTORS A DUTY OF CARE. SO I'M AYE AYE. MORE OF A STATE I DON'T FIND PERSUASIVE THAT GOSH WE BE SUBJECT TO THE REASONABLY PRUDENT PERSON THEIR LOT WORSE STANDARDS AND THIS IS. FRANKLY THE STANDARD THAT IS SO COMMON BECAUSE IT IS REASONABLE IT ALLOWS A JURY IN A FAX SITUATION TO. TO DETERMINE UNDER THOSE FACTS SO I AM NOT CLEAR AT ALL ON WHY THAT IS SUCH A PROBLEM TO BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARD THAT WE WOULD WANT ANYONE. WHO HAS A DUTY OF CARE CONTACT TO HAVE? AS PISSED A STRICT LIABILITY FOR EXAMPLE. CAN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH A REASONABLY PRUDENT BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF HOME INSPECTORS. THE SHOWS WERE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO DO THIS. DONE IT AND. WE HAVE IN THE IN THE BNP CODE ALREADY WE HAVE A LIABILITY. AREA A RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT AS YOU SAID WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY REPORT ON MATERIAL DEFECTS THAT INVOLVE SAFETY AT. HABITABILITY DESIRABILITY AND VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. THIS IS SIMPLY ONE MORE SYSTEM MY POINT IS SIMPLY THAT. EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT WRITE THE ELECTRIC CODE. HAVE SAID THERE'S NO PROOF THAT SAYS THAT MOVING THE BONDING JUMPER FROM ONE PLACE ON THE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER DOES ANYTHING FOR SAFETY. AND. RIGHT BY BASICALLY ADDING US TO THE LIST OF PEOPLE. THAN. IT IF IT DOES I THINK ALATORRE LIABILITY BECAUSE WE HAVE A SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITY TO BEHAVE IN A SPECIFIC WAY. AND IF SOMEBODY CAN MAKE A CASE THAT FOR SOME REASON THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE. THEN DENTAL WORK OR IN THE DEAL CAP AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE FACT QUESTION ISN'T AND AT. THAT HAVE A JURY OR JUDGE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE. SO IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU'RE. ISSUE IS POTENTIALLY ALSO WITH THE ACTUAL STATEMENT SO WOULD YOU FIND IS EITHER SOMEBODY'S GONNA MOVE INTO A HOME. OR PURCHASE A HOME IT USEFUL TO KNOW IF IT HAS CSSD. BUT IT MAY LEAVE LEAVE ASIDE THE STATEMENT THAT'S IN THE BILL THAT THAT MAY BE THAT YOU KNOW MANUFACTURERS THINK THIS IS THE WAY YOU SHOULD DO IT YOU. WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION BEFORE YOU PURCHASE TO HOME I DON'T THINK MOST CONSUMERS. WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE ASSIST HE WAS BUT I THINK MOST HOME INSPECTORS. WOULD.
