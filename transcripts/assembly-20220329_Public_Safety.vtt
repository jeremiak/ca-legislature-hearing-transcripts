EVIDENCE WARRANTS IT WOULD

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.006
IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF JURY

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:25.241
VERDICTS. IT WOULD LESSEN THE

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:26.209
NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS WERE

00:57:26.276 --> 00:57:27.811
CONVICTED OF CRIMES THAT ARE

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:29.879
MORE SERIOUS THAN THE OFFENSE

THEY TRULY COMMITTED. AND IT

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:32.615
WOULD LESSEN THE NUMBER OF

DEFENDANTS TO AVOID CRIMINAL

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:36.286

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:39.656
BECAUSE OF A JURY THAT ACQUITTED

CONVICT THEM OF A LESSER OFFENSE

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:48.565
THAT WAS APPROVED. I SUSPECT THE

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:49.966
OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF OUR STATE

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:52.035
CITIZENS ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:53.603
SPECTRUM WOULD WANT THE

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.905
OPPORTUNITY TO BE INSTRUCTED ON

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:57.740
LESSER RELATED OFFENSES AND HAVE

00:57:57.807 --> 00:57:59.576
THE POWER. TO CONVICT A

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:01.010
DEFENDANT ON SUCH AN OFFENSE IF

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:03.413
THE EVIDENCE WARRANTS AT. OUR

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.181
CURRENT SYSTEM ALLOWS LESSER

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.016
RELATED OFFENSE INSTRUCTIONS

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.719
BASED SOLELY. ON THE

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:11.387
PROSECUTOR'S TACTICAL DECISION

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:12.522
AND INMY EXPERIENCE IT IS

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.524
EXTREMELY RARE FOR PROSECUTORS

00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:16.559
TO CONSENT TO IT CALIFORNIA LAW

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:17.794
SHOULD BE RESTORED TO WHAT IT

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:20.063
WAS FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

00:58:20.129 --> 00:58:21.598
THROUGH NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:22.832
ONE FINAL COMMENT IF I MAY

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:24.767
BEFORE I CLOSE. IT'S IMPORTANT

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:25.869
TO REALIZE THAT UNDER CURRENT

00:58:25.935 --> 00:58:28.037
LAW NOT ONLY ARE JURORS NOT

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.840
GIVEN THE OPTION OF CONVICTING.

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:32.675
ON A LESSER RELATED OFFENSE BUT

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:35.078
THEY AREN'T EVEN INSTRUCTED ON

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.546
THE DEFINITION OF SUCH CRIMES.

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.781
SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE. A SITUATION

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.049
WHERE YOU HAVE A MENTALLY ILL

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:42.652
DEFENDANT WHO'S ARRESTED INSIDE.

AS PART OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:50.444
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL FOR ME- I AND

01:35:50.511 --> 01:35:52.279
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:53.781
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE

01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:54.849
HAVE A COMMITTEE MEMBER WHO

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.150
TALKED ABOUT BEING DIRECTLY

01:35:56.217 --> 01:35:59.453

INCREDIBLY MOVED BY DATA. AND

01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:09.497
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT TO DATE

01:36:09.563 --> 01:36:10.865
GENERALLY INDICATES THAT

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:13.534
INCREASES IN THE CERTAINTY OF

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:14.368
PUNISHMENT AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.704
SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT ARE MORE

01:36:16.770 --> 01:36:18.038
LIKELY TO PRODUCE DETERRENT

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:20.574
BENEFITS SO AS WE ARE SEEKING

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:23.244
WAYS TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT. AT

01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:25.513
THE EXISTENCE OF FENDER VENTS ON

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:28.349
THE USE OF FRENCH IN ALL. IT'S

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.985
PRETTY CLEAR THAT ENHANCEMENTS

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.586
ARE NOT GOING TO BE THE PATHWAY

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:34.555
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND FOR

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:36.524
THAT REASON I WILL BE VOTING ON

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:41.362

PREFERRED THE APPROACH IN

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:52.573
PORTUGAL WHERE DRUG USE IS

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.942
DECRIMINALIZED THAT WOULD LEAD

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:57.611
YOU TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THINGS

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:59.413

YOU COULD TEST FOR FAT KNOWLEDGE

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:02.816
ETCETERA. THAT'S NOT GONNA

01:37:02.883 --> 01:37:05.653

ONE PILL FENTANYL TO KILL WITHIN

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:00.514
ENFORCEABLE. THE PROBLEM WITH

THIS IS- WITH THIS APPROACH IS

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.784

FAILURE TO REPORT. CRIME THE

OF THE HOME. AND FOR THIS REASON

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.281
THE LAW IDENTIFIED NEARLY FIFTY

ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE SAFE

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:27.461
AND EVERYTHING. WHEN CHILDREN

ARE AT SCHOOL IN A SPORTS LEAGUE

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:30.831

THEIR INTERESTS AT THE

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:38.438
FOREFRONT. HOWEVER IN MY WORK I

01:44:38.505 --> 01:44:40.007
HAVE FOUND MANY SITUATIONS WHERE

01:44:40.073 --> 01:44:41.775
MANDATED REPORTERS FAILED TO

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.677
COMPLY WITH THEIR LEGAL

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:45.045
REPORTING OBLIGATIONS. THIS

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:47.047
FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REAL

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:49.850
ALREADY LEGALLY. LEGAL

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:52.519
REQUIREMENTS. BUT THE CHILDREN

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:54.121
AT INCREASED RISK. IT BECAUSE OF

01:44:54.187 --> 01:44:55.956
THE WE GOT THE CHILDREN TO

01:44:56.023 --> 01:44:58.492
SUFFER CONTINUED HARM OF FAILURE

01:44:58.558 --> 01:44:59.393
TO REPORT CAN ALSO EXPOSE

01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:01.128
ADDITIONAL CHILDREN TO FUTURE

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:03.196
HEART. PINE ABUSER WHO COULD

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:05.699
HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:06.900
INVESTIGATED. THE FAILURE TO

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:08.669
REPORT SHIELD THE ABUSER AND

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:10.270
CANNON BALLED IN THE ABUSER TO

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:12.539
COMMIT ADDITIONAL HARM BECAUSE

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:13.974
THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE. AND THE

01:45:14.041 --> 01:45:15.609
FAILURE TO REPORT ALSO

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:16.576
CONTRIBUTES TO A GENERAL

01:45:16.643 --> 01:45:19.212
DISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:20.247
AS THE FAILURE TO REPORT BY

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.982
MANDY TO REPORT RESULTS IN A

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:25.752

REGULARLY EXPERIENCE SHAME GUILT

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.659
AND ISOLATION. BECAUSE CHILDREN

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:35.662
OFTEN DO NOT REPORT BEING ABUSED

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:37.464
IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE MANDATED

01:45:37.531 --> 01:45:39.132
REPORTERS MAKE THE REPORT WHEN

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:41.568
THEY KNOW OR SUSPECT ABUSE. BY

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:43.637
THE TIME OF FAILURE TO REPORT IS

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:45.672
DISCOVERED OFTENTIMES EVIDENCE

01:45:45.739 --> 01:45:47.474

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.276
PERMANENTLY LOST OR ADDITIONAL

ABUSE OF THE SAME CHILD OR OTHER

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.413
CHILDREN WILL HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.315
THE FAILURE REPORT THEREFORE IS

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:57.184
NOT AN ISOLATED ACT BUT IT IS A

01:45:57.250 --> 01:45:59.119
CONTINUING FAILURE WITH ON GOING

01:45:59.186 --> 01:46:00.854
NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS FAR

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:04.191
BEYOND THE ORIGINAL. ABUSE GIVEN

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.459
THAT CHILDREN WHO SUFFER ABUSE

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:07.394

DON'T HAVE A VEHICLE TO

01:58:49.322 --> 01:58:51.858
TRANSPORT THEM. AND BY MAKING IT

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:53.960

WHO THE VICTIM IS NO ONE IS HELD

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:46.946

THEY CAN'T GET TO WORK AND

01:59:58.925 --> 02:00:00.826
OFTENTIMES THE VEHICLE ITSELF.

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:03.596
ISN'T OF VALUE TO WHAT IT TAKES

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:05.364
TO REPAIR THE CAR SO THEY LOSE

02:00:05.431 --> 02:00:07.667

REDUCE THEFT OF CATALYTIC

CONVERTERS. THERE IS HOWEVER NOT

02:03:22.828 --> 02:03:25.331
A CONSENSUS IN ALL RESEARCH THAT

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:26.866
IT'S NOT THE FEAR OF A HIGH

02:03:26.932 --> 02:03:27.900
PENALTY BUT THE FEAR OF

02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:30.302
APPREHENSION THAT DETERS CRIME

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.370

SHOULD LEAVE. THE CURRENT- IN MY

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:11.043
OPINION THE CURRENT PUNISHMENT

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:15.214
IN PLACE- AS WAS SAID BY THE

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.782
REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE ELLA

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:20.586

AND GETTING FIND AT CENTER I

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:26.492
THINK IS A DETERRENT. THE SECOND

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:28.927
THING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:31.263
IS QUESTION OF ATTRIBUTION. SO

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.031
WHAT THE WHAT SHOULD WHAT THE

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:35.434
SHERIFF SAID WHAT YOU CAN'T TELL

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:37.936
WHO OWNS. THAT CATALYTIC

02:09:38.003 --> 02:09:40.873
CONVERTER IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S

02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:41.940
CORRECT THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT

02:09:42.007 --> 02:09:43.408
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN

02:09:43.475 --> 02:09:44.843
CHARGING WHETHER IT'S PETTY

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:47.412
THEFT OR GRAND THEFT- THEY CAN'T

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:49.014
PROVE WHO THE VICTIM OF THE

02:09:49.081 --> 02:09:50.649
CRIME IS EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:52.551
IT'S BEEN TAKEN OFF THE VEHICLE.

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:56.188
YEAH SO SOMEONE HAS CATALYTIC

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:58.924
CONVERTER THEY CAN'T PROVE THAT

02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:00.459
IT'S THERE'S EITHER. WELL THEY

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:02.060
COULD HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION OF

02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:04.530
THEIR VEHICLE THAT CAME OFF OF-

02:10:04.596 --> 02:10:06.365
WITH THEIR VIN NUMBER FROM THAT

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:10.335
VEHICLE- SHOWING THAT- THEY HAD

02:10:10.402 --> 02:10:11.436
TAKEN IT OFF THEIR OWN VEHICLE

02:10:11.503 --> 02:10:13.705
AND THAT.WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US

02:10:13.772 --> 02:10:15.674
TO SAY OKAY- WE CAN GO BACK AND

02:10:15.741 --> 02:10:17.643
VERIFY THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:20.379
IT WAS YOURS SO YEAH BUT GIVEN

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:25.817
THAT- YES THIS. REPRESENTATIVE

02:10:25.884 --> 02:10:27.719
FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER SAID.

02:10:27.786 --> 02:10:29.588
IT DOESN'T HAVE A VIN NUMBER ON

02:10:29.655 --> 02:10:32.357
IT SO PROVING YET THAT IT SURE

02:10:32.424 --> 02:10:34.927
SOUNDS VERY DIFFICULT I THINK

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:35.761
THESE THINGS NEED TO BE

02:10:35.827 --> 02:10:38.297
CORRECTED I THINK THAT THERE IS

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.798
A WAY TO CORRECT THEM WHEN YOU

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:41.733
TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY HAVING FIVE

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.870
CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. WE NEED TO

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:47.206
MAKE THAT A CRIME- WHETHER IT'S

02:10:47.272 --> 02:10:49.541
A MISDEMEANOR WOBBLER WE CAN

02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:51.076
DISCUSS BUT IF IT'S FIVE OF THEM

02:10:51.143 --> 02:10:53.245
PROBABLY IT IS ENOUGH. TO MAKE

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:56.515
IT A FELONY- BUT RIGHT NOW

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.383
YOU'RE MAKING IT YOU GOT TO

02:10:58.450 --> 02:11:00.552
PROVE THAT THAT MONEY IS YOURS

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:02.754
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW YOU

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:04.590
DO THAT. THESE THINGS NEED TO BE

02:11:04.656 --> 02:11:06.391
CORRECTED IN THE BELL AND WHAT

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:07.626
I'D ASK THE AUTHOR TO THINK

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:09.761
ABOUT. OUR IS EITHER WITHDRAWING

02:11:09.828 --> 02:11:11.163
THE BILL AT THIS POINT AND

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:13.098
ASKING THE COMMITTEE TO WORK ON

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:15.667
IT WITH HIM. OR IS IF IT IS

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:17.970
VOTED DOWN- THAN TO ASK FOR

02:11:18.036 --> 02:11:19.571
RECONSIDERATION WORK WITH

02:11:19.638 --> 02:11:21.173
COMMITTEE I JUST THINK THERE ARE

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.108
TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL

02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:24.009
RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK THEY CAN

02:11:24.076 --> 02:11:26.311
BE CORRECTED AND THERE IS A

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:27.746
PROBLEM IF YOU CAN'T PROSECUTE

02:11:27.813 --> 02:11:30.549
SOMEBODY WHO HAS FIVE. CATALYTIC

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:33.018
CONVERTERS THAT'S FOR SURE. SO

02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:37.089
I'M- I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A

02:11:37.155 --> 02:11:39.124
WAY TO FIX THIS BUT I DON'T

02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:41.026
THINK WE CAN DO IT TODAY THANK

02:11:41.093 --> 02:11:45.797
YOU. THIS IS YOUR QUESTION FOR-

02:11:45.864 --> 02:11:49.801
THE SHERIFF- IN IN TRYING TO

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:51.837
PROSECUTE THIS CRIME ONE OF THE

02:11:51.903 --> 02:11:54.172
ISSUES IS THEY GO UNDERNEATH.

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:55.140
EVEN IF THEY'RE CAUGHT IN THE

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:56.942
ACT UNLESS THEY'VE ACTUALLY

02:11:57.009 --> 02:11:58.076
TAKEN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER

02:11:58.143 --> 02:11:59.111
OFF YOU CAN'T CHARGING FOR

02:11:59.177 --> 02:12:00.912
BURGLARY IT'S JUST VANDALISM

02:12:00.979 --> 02:12:02.914
THAT'S CORRECT CORRECT. SO WE'RE

02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:05.183
REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS

02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:08.420
A WAY ESPECIALLY FOR THIS

02:12:08.487 --> 02:12:11.156
PARTICULAR. CRIME TO BE

02:12:11.223 --> 02:12:13.859
PROSECUTED TO BE SOMEBODY HELD

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:17.195
ACCOUNTABLE FOR DOING IT- THIS

02:12:17.262 --> 02:12:20.265
THIS TO ME ALSO HAS A GREATER

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:24.002
EFFECT ON AREAS WHERE. WE'LL

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:26.138
TRADITIONALLY DON'T HAVE. THEIR

02:12:26.204 --> 02:12:29.107
CARS PROTECTED IN A GARAGE AS SO

02:12:29.174 --> 02:12:31.043
THEY'RE LINED UP ON THE STREETS

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:33.178
AND A LOT OF BLACK AND BROWN

02:12:33.245 --> 02:12:34.112
COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING

02:12:34.179 --> 02:12:35.714
ABOUT HERE THAT WE KEEP BRINGING

02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:39.451
UP ABOUT BEING OVERLY IMPACTED.

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:40.085
WELL THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:41.586
GETTING OVERLY IMPACTED THEY'VE

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:47.092
THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES. ARE-

02:12:47.159 --> 02:12:49.294
DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM BLACK

02:12:49.361 --> 02:12:51.363
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. ARE

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.798
BECAUSE THEY WERE AVAILABILITY

02:12:52.864 --> 02:12:55.100
OF VEHICLES OUTSIDE AWAY FROM

02:12:55.167 --> 02:12:58.236
WHERE THEY MIGHT RESIDE AND SO

02:12:58.303 --> 02:13:00.238
IF THE NOISE FROM STEALING THE

02:13:00.305 --> 02:13:02.774
CATHOLIC CONVERTER. OR THE FEAR

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:05.677
OF CONFRONTING SOMEBODY STEALING

02:13:05.744 --> 02:13:10.615
ONE IS NOT- IT AB IF NOBODY'S

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:11.817
GONNA GO REPORT IT YOU'RE NEVER

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.852
GOING TO CATCH THESE FOLKS AND

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:15.554
SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK THIS BILL

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:18.657
IS TRYING TO DO. AND WHILE IT

02:13:18.724 --> 02:13:20.225
DOES HAVE SOME TROUBLES I THINK

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:22.494
. THAT IT'S THE ONLY BILL I'VE

02:13:22.561 --> 02:13:25.230
SEEN THAT IS TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:27.299
THIS ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE IS

02:13:27.366 --> 02:13:28.967
GROWING IT JUST LIKE JUST LIKE

02:13:29.034 --> 02:13:29.968
FINALLY HITS IT'S GROWING

02:13:30.035 --> 02:13:32.671
EXPONENTIALLY AND IT'S AFFECTING

02:13:32.738 --> 02:13:34.172
THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE SAY

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:37.843
WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. AND SO

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:39.311
ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD ASK

02:13:39.378 --> 02:13:41.079
THIS COMMITTEE INSTEAD OF TAKING

02:13:41.146 --> 02:13:43.715
THE APPROACH OF PULL IT IS I

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:46.852
WOULD LIKE TO. **** COMMITTEE TO

02:13:46.918 --> 02:13:48.620
LET THIS BILL GO OUT AND

02:13:48.687 --> 02:13:50.389
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR

02:13:50.455 --> 02:13:51.656
BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT WITH

02:13:51.723 --> 02:13:54.426
OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE SERIOUS

02:13:54.493 --> 02:13:55.594
MORE WAY MORE SERIOUS FLAWS IN

02:13:55.660 --> 02:13:58.830
THIS. AND IN BETWEEN NOW AND

02:13:58.897 --> 02:14:02.534
WHEN IT GOES TO OUR FINAL VOTE-

02:14:02.601 --> 02:14:06.304
WE'RE ABLE TO- DISCERN WHETHER.

02:14:06.371 --> 02:14:06.972
OUR OUR ISSUES HAVE BEEN

02:14:07.038 --> 02:14:10.041
ADDRESSED. AND SO I WOULD ASK

02:14:10.108 --> 02:14:11.076
THE COMMITTEE TO ALLOW THIS BILL

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:13.845
TO GO OUT. AND BETWEEN NOW AND

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:17.115
WHEN WE SEE IT AGAIN- WE

02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:19.117
DETERMINE WHETHER- BECAUSE WE DO

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:21.386
HAVE THAT OPTION DETERMINE

02:14:21.453 --> 02:14:23.488
WHETHER IT EXISTS IT DID IS

02:14:23.555 --> 02:14:25.223
SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING THE

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:27.959
ISSUES. THAT WE HAVE BUT AND I

02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:29.294
THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO%

02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:31.029
WORK ON THIS BILL BECAUSE

02:14:31.096 --> 02:14:33.231
WITHOUT THIS BILL WE DON'T HAVE

02:14:33.298 --> 02:14:34.032
ANY BILL. AND ANOTHER YEAR AND

02:14:34.099 --> 02:14:35.834
SOME CHANGE BEFORE WE START

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:37.002
LOOKING AT WHAT WE DO ABOUT

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:39.471

YOU HAVE A CONSTITUENT CALL OR

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:18.710
SEVERAL AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE

02:20:18.777 --> 02:20:22.480

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:24.716
ME TODAY THE STRUGGLE IS. WHAT'S

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.851
BEEN SAID A FEW TIMES IS THAT WE

02:20:26.918 --> 02:20:28.686
DON'T WANT TO ADD A NEW CRIME

02:20:28.753 --> 02:20:30.889
AND WE DON'T WANT TO ADD NEW

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:31.723
PENALTIES BUT THAT EFFECTIVELY

02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:33.358
IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES WITH THE

02:20:33.424 --> 02:20:34.959
WOBBLER AND THE CHANGING THE

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:35.760
DEFINITION OF THE EXISTING CRIME

02:20:35.827 --> 02:20:37.262
AND RAISES THE PENALTY AND IT

02:20:37.328 --> 02:20:39.063
CREATES A NEW CATEGORY BOTH

02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:40.565
SIMULTANEOUSLY AND WE KNOW

02:20:40.632 --> 02:20:41.566
WOBBLIES DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:20:41.633 --> 02:20:43.268
IMPACT. BLACK BROWN POINT

02:20:43.334 --> 02:20:44.669
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE BECAUSE THE

02:20:44.736 --> 02:20:46.437
DISCRETION TO GO FELONY OR

02:20:46.504 --> 02:20:48.373
OTHERWISE OFTEN FALLS ON

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:49.507
IMMUTABLE CHARACTERISTICS AND

02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:51.009
NOT ALWAYS THE CHARACTERISTICS

02:20:51.075 --> 02:20:52.977
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN ADDITION

02:20:53.044 --> 02:20:54.112
TO THE FACT THAT MISDEMEANOR THE

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:55.513
WHOLE SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:20:55.580 --> 02:20:56.481
IMPACTS BLACK BROWN POOR

02:20:56.548 --> 02:20:58.683
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND SO I HOPE

02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:59.918
THAT IF THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.853

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:30.942
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THIS

02:22:31.009 --> 02:22:32.810

TELLING YOU THIS PROBLEM HAS

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:55.700
DONE THAT TO PEOPLE. IT IS PUT

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:57.835
THEM IN A PLACE THAT THEY HAVE

02:22:57.902 --> 02:22:59.904
TO GO TO A POINT OF DESPERATION

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:01.572
THAT IF WE HAD SOME PUBLIC

02:23:01.639 --> 02:23:03.608
POLICY TO ADDRESS THIS. THEY MAY

02:23:03.675 --> 02:23:05.610
NOT BE IN THAT POSITION THEY MAY

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:08.246
NOT HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THE STAFF

02:23:08.313 --> 02:23:10.848

FOR THESE A CATALYTIC CONVERTERS

02:23:30.635 --> 02:23:32.070
THAT IS LESS THAN FIFTEEN

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:33.738
HUNDRED DOLLARS I THINK IT'S

02:23:33.805 --> 02:23:34.939
WELL BEYOND THAT AND IN MANY

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:38.376
CASES BUT- I JUST WISH. THE

02:23:38.443 --> 02:23:39.877
OTHERS ON THIS COMMITTEE WOULD

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.946
SEE THE IMPORTANCE AND THE

02:23:42.013 --> 02:23:44.849
NECESSITY FOR SOME INTERVENTION

02:23:44.916 --> 02:23:47.952

THE EXPECTATION AND WE WEREN'T

02:23:57.462 --> 02:23:59.163
ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS THING

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:01.532
YOU VOTED DOWN WHEN IT GETS TO

02:24:01.599 --> 02:24:03.501

IT IT MAY NOT BE WHERE IT NEEDS

02:24:10.041 --> 02:24:12.610
TO BE. BUT WE CAN WORK ON THAT

02:24:12.677 --> 02:24:14.579
AND I HOPE THE PEOPLE GIVEN A

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:19.550

IT'S SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THIS

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:09.667
COMMITTEE- THE REASON THEY WOULD

02:25:09.734 --> 02:25:12.937
VOTED DOWN AND ASK FOR YOU AFTER

OF THE COMMITTEE WANTS- THE

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:41.332
REASON WE DON'T IS BECAUSE

02:25:41.399 --> 02:25:43.401
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO GET TO KNOW

02:25:43.468 --> 02:25:45.503

EVEN IF IT'S AGAINST WHAT THE

02:26:00.751 --> 02:26:02.653
OPPOSITION WANT THAT GROUP WERE

02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:05.790
FORMALLY- WITH THAT WE'VE HAD

OUT THERE NOW LOBBYING THE REST

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.863
OF THE ASSEMBLY INSTEAD OF

I FOCUSED ON DETAINED WORK. SO I

02:48:25.962 --> 02:48:28.598
REALLY HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE

02:48:28.665 --> 02:48:30.733

CONVICTIONS FOR PERSONAL USE-

02:48:38.641 --> 02:48:41.244
HAVE ON BOTH OUR CITIZENS AND

02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:45.548
OUR NON CITIZENS I AM. SO AB

02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:46.349

02:48:46.416 --> 02:48:49.152
SETS OUT TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION

02:48:49.219 --> 02:48:54.090

JONES SAWYER ALREADY ELOQUENTLY

02:48:56.125 --> 02:48:59.762
STATED FOR I WERE NONCITIZENS-

02:48:59.829 --> 02:49:01.464
SORRY FOR OUR CITIZENS DRUG

02:49:01.531 --> 02:49:03.566
CONVICTIONS CAN LEAD TO LOSS OF

02:49:03.633 --> 02:49:06.069
HOUSING- AND EMPLOYMENT

02:49:06.135 --> 02:49:08.771
OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE

02:49:08.838 --> 02:49:10.907
MANY OF MY YOUNG CLIENTS OF

02:49:10.974 --> 02:49:13.843
COLOR AFTER THEY SUFFERED A DRUG

02:49:13.910 --> 02:49:16.012
CONVICTION- THEY WERE HOMELESS

02:49:16.079 --> 02:49:17.213
THEY BECAME HOMELESS BECAUSE

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:19.182
THEY COULDN'T RETURN BACK TO.

02:49:19.249 --> 02:49:20.817
THEIR FOR THEIR FAMILY THAT

02:49:20.884 --> 02:49:22.485
LIVED IN SECTION EIGHT HOUSING

02:49:22.552 --> 02:49:25.455
AND- FOR THOSE CLIENTS HAVE

02:49:25.522 --> 02:49:26.823
ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO

02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:28.958
REHABILITATE AND YEARS LATER

02:49:29.025 --> 02:49:31.194
WANT TO OBTAIN SOME SORT OF A

02:49:31.261 --> 02:49:32.428
LICENSING LIKE AT A NURSING

02:49:32.495 --> 02:49:34.731
LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE ABLE

02:49:34.797 --> 02:49:36.232
TO DO SO. AND THEY CANNOT EVEN

02:49:36.299 --> 02:49:38.201
BECOME IN HOME CARE PROVIDERS IF

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:40.436
THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF

02:49:40.503 --> 02:49:42.405
SOMEONE LIKE A LOVED ONE IN

02:49:42.472 --> 02:49:44.574
THEIR FAMILY. SO FOR NONCITIZENS

02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:48.311
DAY AND THAT THE CONSEQUENCES

02:49:48.378 --> 02:49:51.614
ARE FAR WORSE. OF FOR OUR

02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:54.183
NONCITIZEN CLIENTS INCLUDING

02:49:54.250 --> 02:49:55.985
INCLUDING LAWFUL PERMANENT

02:49:56.052 --> 02:49:58.354
RESIDENTS A DRUG CONVICTION

02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:02.125
LEADS TO MANDATORY ICE DETENTION

02:50:02.191 --> 02:50:03.893
. SO THAT MEANS THAT A JUDGE

02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:04.994
DOESN'T HAVE DISCRETION TO SET A

02:50:05.061 --> 02:50:09.232
BOND. LEADS TO DEPORTATION. AND

02:50:09.299 --> 02:50:10.767
THE INABILITY TO ADJUST TO

02:50:10.833 --> 02:50:12.802
STATUS SO THAT MEANS THAT IF

02:50:12.869 --> 02:50:14.437
SOMEONE IS MARRIED TO A US

02:50:14.504 --> 02:50:16.105
CITIZEN OR HAVE US CITIZEN

02:50:16.172 --> 02:50:18.775
CHILDREN THEY CANNOT OBTAIN A

02:50:18.841 --> 02:50:21.744
GREEN CARD. AND IN THE NINTH

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:23.846
CIRCUIT WE HAD A LOT LAST KIND

02:50:23.913 --> 02:50:26.215
OF LINE OF DEFENSE AND IF WE

02:50:26.282 --> 02:50:27.951
DIDN'T NAME THE CONTROLLED

02:50:28.017 --> 02:50:30.954
SUBSTANCE- WE COULD AVOID THE

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:32.622
CONVICTION THE DRUG CONVICTION

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:34.591
FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES.

02:50:34.657 --> 02:50:36.459
UNFORTUNATELY LAST YEAR THE

02:50:36.526 --> 02:50:39.162
SUPREME COURT AND PRAY THAT THE

02:50:39.228 --> 02:50:41.397
WILKINSON OVERTURNED THIS LAST

02:50:41.464 --> 02:50:44.567
LINE OF DEFENSE. SO WE CANNOT WE

02:50:44.634 --> 02:50:47.937
CAN'T DO THAT AND WE DON'T HAVE

02:50:48.004 --> 02:50:52.308
MANY PTIONS ANYMORE. SO AB

02:50:52.375 --> 02:50:53.343
TWENTY ONE NINETY FIVE PROVIDES

02:50:53.409 --> 02:50:55.378
A REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE THAT

02:50:55.445 --> 02:50:58.114
PROSECUTORS CAN OFFER IN LIEU OF

02:50:58.181 --> 02:51:00.516
A OF A DRUG OFFENSE. AND THIS

02:51:00.583 --> 02:51:03.553
BILL IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:06.389
FREE CARD AT ALL. THROUGH THIS

02:51:06.456 --> 02:51:08.024
MEASURE PROSECUTORS THE

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:09.125
PROSECUTORS WILL HAVE THE

02:51:09.192 --> 02:51:11.628
DISCRETION TO EVALUATE EACH CASE

02:51:11.694 --> 02:51:14.497
INDIVIDUALLY. TO DETERMINE

02:51:14.564 --> 02:51:16.599
WHETHER AN ALTERNATE PLEA WOULD

02:51:16.666 --> 02:51:19.636
SERVE THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE.

02:51:19.702 --> 02:51:22.672
NOW HAVING- HAVING TROUBLE LIKE

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:24.007
ALL THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES

02:51:24.073 --> 02:51:26.409
AB SORRY ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA I

02:51:26.476 --> 02:51:29.545
ACTUALLY WOULD GO TO ALL THE

02:51:29.612 --> 02:51:30.680
I'VE BEEN TO LIKE OVER TEN

02:51:30.747 --> 02:51:32.248
DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN IN

02:51:32.315 --> 02:51:34.851
CALIFORNIA TO NEGOTIATE CASES

02:51:34.917 --> 02:51:36.986
FROM MY NONCITIZEN CLIENTS AND

02:51:37.053 --> 02:51:38.821
WHAT I FOUND IS THAT EVEN IN THE

02:51:38.888 --> 02:51:41.791
MOST CONSERVATIVE JURISDICTIONS

02:51:41.858 --> 02:51:44.227
. EXECUTORS ARE OPEN AND THEY

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:46.629
WANT TO SERVE JUSTICE SO THEY

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:48.331
THEY ARE THEY DO NOT WANT AN

02:51:48.398 --> 02:51:51.000
INDIVIDUAL- TO BE PERMANENTLY

02:51:51.067 --> 02:51:53.670
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILY-

02:51:53.736 --> 02:51:56.139
AND- NOT YOU KNOW BE BANISHED IN

ISN'T TRYING TO COLLECT THE DATA

. THAT ENSURES THAT WE HAVE AN

03:22:55.763 --> 03:22:57.865
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT ALL%

03:22:57.932 --> 03:22:59.367

INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PUBLIC AND

PEACE OFFICERS AND IT WOULD AND

03:23:21.856 --> 03:23:23.824
IT ERODES OUR ABILITY AS

03:23:23.891 --> 03:23:25.560
COMMUNITIES TO REALLY HAVE FULL

03:23:25.626 --> 03:23:27.562
FAITH AND TRUST IN OUR PEACE

03:23:27.628 --> 03:23:29.697
OFFICERS WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL

03:23:29.764 --> 03:23:32.600
WANT. AND FOR THAT REASON I'M

03:23:32.667 --> 03:23:37.138
GOING TO OPPOSE THIS. BILL. YES

03:23:37.204 --> 03:23:41.175
I'D LIKE. O ASK A YES SIDE I

03:23:41.242 --> 03:23:42.810
DON'T THINK THIS IS THE FIRST

03:23:42.877 --> 03:23:43.978
TIME WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION

03:23:44.045 --> 03:23:47.582
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR POINT I.

03:23:47.648 --> 03:23:48.683
AND HERE'S THE REASON WHY

03:23:48.749 --> 03:23:50.818
SUPPORT THIS IS BECAUSE THE

03:23:50.885 --> 03:23:52.853
REASON FOR THIS DATA GATHERING

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:54.355
IS TO FOCUS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT'S

03:23:54.422 --> 03:23:57.959
DISCRETION. AND WHEN YOU GET A

03:23:58.025 --> 03:24:00.328
CALL OVER THE RADIO. YOU HAVE NO

03:24:00.394 --> 03:24:02.964

YOU RESPOND TO THAT CALL FOR

03:24:04.966 --> 03:24:07.668
SERVICE. AND SO I THINK IT'S

03:24:07.735 --> 03:24:11.138
MISLEADING. WHEN WE QUITE. SOME

03:24:11.205 --> 03:24:12.707
OF THIS DATA THAT'S BEING

03:24:12.773 --> 03:24:15.042
GATHERED AS DISCRETIONARY-

03:24:15.109 --> 03:24:16.811
RESPONSE IT'S COMPLETELY

03:24:16.877 --> 03:24:18.212
MISLEADING AND I DON'T THINK

03:24:18.279 --> 03:24:21.282
IT'S FAIR AND FOR THAT REASON I

03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:22.483
COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT

03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:24.619

THE SO THAT ONE CAN LOOK AT

03:24:44.605 --> 03:24:46.040
SEPARATELY I THINK ALL OF THE

03:24:46.107 --> 03:24:47.675
DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED BUT

03:24:47.742 --> 03:24:50.378
PERHAPS MR LACKEY DOES HAVE A

03:24:50.444 --> 03:24:53.814
POINT- IN SOME CASES WHAT WE'RE

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:55.916
LOOKING AT IS POLICE. MAKING A

03:24:55.983 --> 03:24:58.486
DISCRETIONARY A STOP IN ANOTHER

03:24:58.552 --> 03:25:01.622
CASE EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE

03:25:01.689 --> 03:25:04.258

03:25:04.325 --> 03:25:07.662
POLICE OFFICERS FALL. HI MY I

03:25:07.728 --> 03:25:10.197
THINK WHAT THE MATTER IS BEFORE

US TODAY IS NOT. I UNDERSTAND

03:25:12.667 --> 03:25:16.170
THAT PERHAPS IF IT DOESN'T PASS-

03:25:16.237 --> 03:25:17.238
WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

03:25:17.304 --> 03:25:19.407
APPROACH THE IN LAWS LIKE WITH

03:25:19.473 --> 03:25:20.941
