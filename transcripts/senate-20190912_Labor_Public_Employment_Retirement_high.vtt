WITH EACH OTHER AND CUT OFF

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.292
VERTICALLY IN THIS TIME

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.761
NATIONALLY THAT ARE CUT OFF.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:16.362

SEVENTY TODAY REALLY THANK YOU

SENATOR JEFF HILL AYE I ALSO

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.938
THINK. THAT IS CRITICALLY

00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:27.306
IMPORTANT A SMALL PAPERS THE

00:08:27.373 --> 00:08:29.141
LOCAL PAPER SO PEOPLE KNOW

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.343
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LOCAL

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.345
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OTHERWISE.

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.846
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW I MEAN THEY

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.314
ARE THAT CRITICAL I THINK IN

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.549
OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT I

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:37.717
ALSO THINK THE NEWSPAPER

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:40.186
INDUSTRY IN GENERAL. IS OF

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.754
RIGHT NOW IN A VERY DIFFICULT

00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:44.590
TIME WHILE I DON'T WANT TO SEE

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:48.628
THEM TRY TO. RECOVER OR TO BE

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.529
ABLE TO CONTINUE ON THE BACKS

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:51.564
OF THE LOWEST PAID PEOPLE WHICH

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:54.333
ARE AS YOU INDICATE THAT. THE

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.134
PEOPLE WHO DO THIS KIND OF

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.271
WORK. I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.273
RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE HOW

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:01.741
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT IS THAT

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:02.942
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A FREE

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:06.612
PRESS. AND MANY PAPERS LARGE AS

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:09.315
WELL AS SMALL ARE. SUFFERING

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.517
RIGHT NOW IN OUR THREATENED BY

00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:15.354
THE INTERNET. BUT I DO THINK

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.222
THAT MOST OF OUR PAPERS HAVE

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:20.760
ENORMOUS VALUE. BIGGER PAPERS

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:21.360
THAT THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDE YOU

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:23.896
WITH THE NEWS NOT PROPAGANDA

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.264
AND I THINK THAT THAT IS ALSO

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.966
SOMETHING WE NEED TO FACTOR IN.

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:29.502
THAT BEING SAID I'VE ALWAYS

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:33.339
WONDERED WHY IT IS. I RECALL AS

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.140
A KID AND THEN EVEN MY OWN

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:37.109
GRANDKIDS WHO. DO PAPER ROUTES

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:38.945
AND END UP HAVING TO COLLECT

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:42.782
THE MONEY. OF FROM THE FOLKS TO

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:44.750
WHOM THEY DELIVER PAPERS A FIVE

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.118
IN THE MORNING. OR ELSE THEY

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:48.087
HAVE TO FUND THE- THEY HAVE TO

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.756
PAY THE COMPANY ITSELF. IN

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:52.892
OTHER WORDS THAT THEY ARE SO

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.493
INDEPENDENT THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.663
COLLECT. FROM THE READER OR

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.665
ELSE THEY HAVE TO PAY IN THE

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:01.233
FEW PENNIES AND NICKELS THAT

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.370
THEY HAVE MADE. IN THOSE PAPER

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.540
ROUTES AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.774
THEMSELVES I HOPE THAT'S GOING

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:10.142
TO CHANGE TO THAT SEEMS SO

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:13.279
INHERENTLY. UNFAIR SO I THINK

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:14.647
THERE IS SOME WORK THAT NEEDS

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:18.317
TO BE DONE. OVER THE NEXT YEAR

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.752
I WANT TO PRESERVE THE

00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.854
INTEGRITY OF THE FREE PRESS IT

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:25.124
IS CRITICAL AND MARK SEE. A

00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:28.761
SMALL PAPERS ARE CRITICAL TO

00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:33.332
THE WELL BEING OF COMMUNITIES.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.667
BRENT THE THIRD CHALLENGED

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:35.634
MONEY IN TODAY'S WORLD BUT-

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:36.836
HOPEFULLY. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.671
IT NOT ON THE BACKS OF THE- OF

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:39.305
THE SMALLEST THOSE WHO MAKE THE

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:41.207
LEAST AND WHO. FIVE IN THE

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:42.074
MORNING IS HARD FOR ANYBODY LET

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.843
ALONE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE.

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:45.678
TRYING TO JUST MAKE ENDS MEET

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.680
SO WITH THAT I WILL ALSO

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:49.448

TO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:08.814
BE AN EXTENSION AND- I THINK

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:09.615
IT'S IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.218

LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:44.850
SOLUTION. SOMETIME DURING THIS

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:45.884
YEAR THAT WILL WORK FOR THEM

CLOSE. I WOULD BE LYING IF I

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:58.864
SAID THIS ISN'T A HEARTBREAKING

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:01.133
FOR ME BECAUSE THE DYNAMICS

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.835
DECISION. WAS AIMED AT. THIS

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:05.604
TYPE OF A. B. THE NEWSPAPER

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:07.940
INDUSTRY FOR GENERATIONS

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:09.241
ALTHOUGH THEY NO LONGER REQUIRE

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:11.110
YOU TO CUT YOUR OWN MONEY.

00:15:11.176 --> 00:15:11.710
THAT'S HOW IT WAS WHEN I WAS A

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:14.680
GIRL. HAVE BEEN MISSED FIND

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:15.748
WORKERS THEY HAVE FACED

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.383
COUNTLESS LAWSUITS UNDER DINA

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:19.451
ARE UNDER BROWN LOW AND HAVE

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:22.454
LOS THOSE. THEY. WILL CONTINUE

00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.824
TO FACE LAWSUIT. I WAS

00:15:25.891 --> 00:15:26.825
HEARTBROKEN FIND OUT THAT

00:15:26.892 --> 00:15:29.161
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PENDING

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.296
LAWSUITS AND NOW I UNDERSTAND

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:32.131
THE REASONING WHY WE COULDN'T

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:34.466
MAKE THIS EXEMPTION JUST FOR

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:37.069
THE SMALL WEEKLIES AND BASED ON

00:15:37.136 --> 00:15:38.070
CIRCULATION NUMBERS BECAUSE OUR

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:39.538
LARGEST NEWSPAPERS ARE IN FACT

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:43.342
CURRENTLY FACING CLAIMS. WHICH

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:44.610
WELL AT THE BEST BE JUSTICE

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:46.745
DELAYED PROBABLY JUSTICE DENIED

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.480
BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE

00:15:48.547 --> 00:15:49.682
TO SUE UNDER DYNAMAX BECAUSE OF

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:51.150
THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN.

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.551
THEY WILL BE EXEMPTED FROM

00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:56.889
THOSE CLAIMS ARE ONCE EVEN AB

00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:58.857
FIVE APPLIES FROM THE CLAIMS

00:15:58.924 --> 00:15:59.425
BETWEEN THE TIME OF DYNAMAX.

00:15:59.491 --> 00:16:02.695
AND WHEN THEY MUST COMPLY. THE

00:16:02.761 --> 00:16:03.262
UP A POINT THAT OUT I THINK

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:05.331
IT'S IMPORTANT. ALSO THINK IT'S

00:16:05.397 --> 00:16:10.369
IMPORTANT. WHEN WE DO BILLS TO

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:11.970
A SOMETIMES AND IT'S NOT THE

00:16:12.037 --> 00:16:13.405
FIRST TIME IN PEACE LEGISLATION

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:15.841
I'VE HAD TO SWALLOW HARD AND

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:17.810
EXEMPTS PEOPLE WHO I FEEL LIKE

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:19.178
ARE AT TE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE

00:16:19.244 --> 00:16:20.846
TRYING TO DO THERE'S NO

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:23.916
LEGITIMATE REASON BESIDES THE

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:26.685
FACT THAT OF. THE ENTIRE NEW

00:16:26.752 --> 00:16:28.654
SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA WEAPONIZE

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:30.422
THEIR EDITORIAL PAGE AGAINST

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:32.391
THIS BILL BASED ONLY ON

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:35.227
NEWSPAPER CARRIERS AND- IT'S A

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:37.262
LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL. BUT NAY

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.064
END AB FIVE WILL COVER A

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:40.499
MILLION WORKERS WHO NEED THEIR

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.435
PROTECTION. AND SO I'M WILLING

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.237
TO CARRY THIS BILL AT THAT FOR

00:16:45.304 --> 00:16:46.572
THE RECORD WANT TO POINT OUT IT

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:49.541
IS A- WITH A HEAVY HEART. AND

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:50.175
NOT SOMETHING THAT'S REFLECTIVE

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:55.080
