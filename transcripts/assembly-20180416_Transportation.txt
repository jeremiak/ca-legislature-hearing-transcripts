THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A. B.. EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT A BILL WHICH SEEKS TO ADDRESS OUR SERIOUS AND GROWING PROBLEM. OF WIDESPREAD HOMELESSNESS. THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO EXPAND UPON EXISTING LAW. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. WHICH STATES THAT CALTRANS SHALL OFFER ONLY THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE ABILITY TO LEASE PROPERTY FOR EMERGENCY. SHELTERS AND FEEDING PROGRAMS FOR ONE DOLLAR A MONTH. I OPPOSE THIS MEASURE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE THAT CHOSE TO IGNORE THE SERIOUSNESS OF HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE. HOMELESSNESS IS NOT LIMITED TO SAN FRANCISCO. YET WE OFFER THIS LOW COST OPPORTUNITY. TO THE MOST AFFLUENT URBAN AREA IN THE COUNTRY. IF IT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR SAN FRANCISCO. IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF THE STATE. WE CANNOT STAND BY WHITE PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO FIND HOUSING OPTIONS AND HOT MILFS. CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF UN SHELTERED HOMELESS. OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION AT SIXTY SIX PERCENT. CALIFORNIA ALSO RANKS AS THE SECOND HIGHEST. FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATIONS. WELL THERE HAS BEEN SOME HEADWAY. WITH REGARD TO EFFORTS TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. MANY WHO ARE CURRENTLY HOMELESS HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS. WITHOUT PROACTIVE EFFORTS THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. ONE SUCH OPTION IS TO EXPAND ON LAST YEAR'S EFFORTS. CALTRANS OWNS NUMEROUS. ON USE PARCELS OF LAND MANY OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS AMENITIES OFTEN LACK THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE HOMELESS SERVICES FOOD ASSISTANCE. AND COMMUNITY PARKS FOR THEIR RESIDENTS. IN FACT. OF THE EXISTING CONTINUE ARMS OF CARE ORGANIZATIONS CURRENTLY SERVING HOMELESS POPULATIONS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND LOS ANGELES HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF HOMELESS WITHOUT ADEQUATE ACCESS. TWO FORMS OF SHELTER. ONE SUCH SOLUTION TO THESE REESE REOCCURRING CHALLENGES. CAN BE FOUND. WITHIN THE ACTIVE USE. OF PRESENTLY UNUSED PARCELS OF LAND. A. B. EIGHTEEN NINETY A. WOULD REQUIRE CALTRANS TO LEASE ON YEARS PARCELS OF LAND APPLE LOW MARKET RATES. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONSTRUCTING EMERGENCY SHELTERS AND FOOD PANTRY LOCATIONS. IT IS THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP. THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CAN PROVIDE REAL SOLUTIONS. TO ITS HOMELESS AND AT RISK RESIDENTS. FURTHERMORE. AB EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OPEN AIR SPACES AND RECREATIONAL PARKS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. ULTIMATELY THIS BILL AIMS TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR RESIDENTS AND PUT VACANT LAND. GOOD USE AT A NOMINAL*. I ASKED YOU AFFIRM YOUR COMMITMENT TO ASSIST OUR HOMELESSNESS. AND AT RISK POPULATIONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I'VE. MISTER MATHIS HAVE YOU. ENTERTAINED THE FACT OF THE. EXCEPTING THE COMMITTEES OF AMENDMENTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN I COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS DO NOT OFFER THE SHALL THEY MAKES IT OPTIONAL TO CALTRANS AND AGAIN IF THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR. SAN FRANCISCO IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF THE STATE ALSO BELIEVE THERE'S A SIMILAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION EXTENDING THIS. ONLY TO THE CITY OF OAKLAND. THAT IS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.

I'VE MEMBERS IS JUST A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT SAYS WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE REPLACING OLD SCHOOL BUSES FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT ARE BREATHING OLD.

TO ENABLE MUNICIPALITIES TO COMPETE FOR GRANT FUNDING FOR A MERGING TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES TO SERVE THEIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM NEEDS. THIS UP PROPOSAL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS MODELED AFTER SUCCESSFUL FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM AND WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THE CDC AND IT'S. A TWENTY SEVENTEEN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. TWENTY FOUR EIGHTEEN TASKS THE CTC WITH DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND SELECTION CRITERIA FOR THE GRANT PROGRAM IN CONSULTATION WITH THE WORK GROUP. THAT WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES LOCAL TRANSPORTATION ORGANIZATIONS AND UC'S INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AMONG OTHERS THIS BILL DOES NOT PREDETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WILL BE AWARDED IN THE GRANT. WE WILL DETERMINE THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IN A FUTURE YEAR ONCE THE CTC ESTABLISHES THE GUIDELINES AND SELECTION CRITERIA. HAS HE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT ONE OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE FORTY MILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL GRANT PROGRAM WAS SET THE SEVENTY EIGHT PARTICIPATING CITIES. THAT DEVELOPED SMART CITY PLANS WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN POP AND PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THEIR RESPECTIVE VISIONS. THAT NUMBER INCLUDED TWELVE BUT PERMEATE PARDON ME. ELEVEN CALIFORNIA CITIES INCLUDING LONG BEACH. RIVERSIDE AND MORENO VALLEY. SAN JOSE SACRAMENTO OAKLAND IN FRESNO SAN FRANCISCO WAS ONE OF THE SEVEN NATIONAL FINALIST AND RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO FURTHER DEVELOP ITS PLAN. I THINK THAT WE CAN BUILD OFF OF THAT SUCCESS AND SEND MORE CALIFORNIA CITIES TO USE ADVANCED DATA AND INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS.

THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE FRAZIER. FRAZIER AYE FONG FUNG I AND WE ARE CURRY. AND WE ARE CURRY AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE BERMAN. CHIU. DALY. DALY AYE FRIEDMAN. FRIEDMAN I GIPSON. GIPSON AYE HARPER HARPER AYE MATHIS. MEDINA. MEDINA AYE NAZARIAN. O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL AYE. THAT IS TO KEEP THE RULE THROUGH PERHAPS A MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER BOTH. I WAS FIRST. MISS MELINDA'S. DON'T FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY AT ONE OF THE LARGEST PROBLEMS FACING LOW INCOME FAMILIES TODAY. IS THE ABILITY TO GET THEIR CHILDREN TO AND FROM SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND GRADE SCHOOL STUDENTS MISS EIGHTEEN DAYS MORE SCHOOL ON AVERAGE. IN OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND MISTER THIRTY SIX DAYS OR MORE WHICH IS TWENTY PERCENT OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. OVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE CHRONICALLY ABSENT OR LOW INCOME THIS IS BECAUSE ONLY ONE IN EVERY TENTH GRADE SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN AFFORD RIDING THE BUS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE TO KNOW FUNDING TO PURCHASE SCHOOL BUSES BUT THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE THE MONEY. THE LEGISLATURE'S CONTINUED TO ALLOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE SPENT ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT INSTEAD. THE FUNDING LEFT FROM THE EXISTING BOND FUND ALONE WOULD ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD CAN RIDE THE BUS TO SCHOOL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WITH SEVENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS SAYING THEY WOULD LIKE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FIFTY TWO PERCENT SAYING IT SHOULD BE STOPPED OUT RIGHT. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BRING THIS ISSUE BACK TO THE VOTERS TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE BY ME FUNDING THIS TRAIN OR WHETHER THEY WOULD LIKE TO INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY WELL UPON A VOTER APPROVAL REALLOCATE THE REMAINING BOND FUNDING FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL TO CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL BUS PROGRAM. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW ALL STUDENTS DESPITE A FAMILIES INCOME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO QUALITY EDUCATION BY REMOVING BARRIERS TO ACCESS. NO CHILD SHOT TO FALL BEHIND SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE UNABLE TO GET TO SCHOOL HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DAVID WALL FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. PLEASE PROCEED SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY. MEMBERS WITH EACH PASSING DAY IT'S CARD THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS SIMPLY NOT VIABLE. THE RECENT DROP BUSINESS PLAN SHOWS JUST HOW UNREALISTIC THE PRODUCT OF THE PROJECT IS BECOMING. IT CONTINUES TO BANK ON ONGOING FEDERAL FUNDING EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN EIGHT YEARS SINCE THE ONLY THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. INFUSION CAME AND NO MONEY NO MORE MONEY APPEARS TO BE FORTHCOMING. THERE'S BEEN ZERO PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE TRAIN NOR WILL THERE BE BECAUSE THE STATE CANNOT OFFER MINIMUM REVENUE GUARANTEES TO INVESTORS WITHOUT VIOLATING THE PROVISION IN MAYBE THIRTY THIRTY FOR. THE GENERAL FUND SPENDING CAN BE USED TO PROMOTE ONGOING SUBSIDIES. THE ONLY FUNDING REALLY KEEPING THIS TRAIN OF PO A FLOWED AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS. AND MEANWHILE MEMBERS THE COST OF THE TREND CONTINUES TO CLIMB THE FIRST SEGMENT IS NOW TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OVER BUDGET AND CLIMBING. AND THE OVERALL COST OF THE TRAIN IN THE BUSINESS PLAN IS JUMPED FROM SIXTY FOUR TO SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION AND COULD GO AS HIGH AS NINETY EIGHT BILLION. MEMBERS I LOVE. THE QUESTION MISTER FONG ASKED LAST WEEK OF THE LA NOW IN THE BUDGET FINANCE HEARING AND THE ANSWER GIVEN WAS THAT THE TRAIN IS SHORT BY FIFTY SIX TO SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO COME FROM. THE BUSINESS PLAN DID PROVIDE A PARTIAL ANSWER THE PLAN THAT WAS RELEASED LAST MONTH AND THAT WAS WE SHOULD EXTEND CAP AND TRADE FROM TWENTY THIRTY TO TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY. MEMBERS THAT SEEMS POLITICALLY DICEY ESPECIALLY WHEN HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT A GUARANTEE ELIMINATOR OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND MEMBERS WHAT REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH THIS PLAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BLENDED RAIL PLAN THAT NO LONGER REPRESENTS A TRADITIONAL HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY LONGTIME HIGH SPEED RAIL SUPPORTER. CRETIN COPPICE PULL THIS SUPPORT FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND. AND THE LIST OF PROBLEMS EVEN CONTINUES I MEAN AGAIN RIGHT NOW. THIS TRAIN WAS NEVER ECONOMICALLY VIABLE WERE TALKING ABOUT A TRAIN THAT GOES FROM SAN JOSE TO WASCO. IT TERMINATES IN WASCO. HOW IS THIS GOING TO BE POLITICALLY VIABLE AND THE LIST OF PROBLEMS EVEN CONTINUES GOING ON FROM THERE? NO TRAIN IN THE WORLD CAN CONSISTENTLY ACHIEVE THE STATUTORY REQUIRED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES AN HOUR. BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES WHICH IS WHAT WAS REQUIRED IN AB THIRTY THIRTY FOUR THERE'S THREE PLACES NOW ON THE PROPOSED ROUTE WITH THE TRAIN OFF THE THROTTLE BACK TO HALF SPEED. SO INSTEAD OF TAKING TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES TO GET FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES IT COULD TAKE AS LONG AS FOUR HOURS. MEANWHILE MEMBERS THERE'S THIS LITTLE THING CALLED SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. WHAT'S GOING TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO BUSINESS TRAVELERS. HIGH SPEED RAIL SUPPORTERS CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT DIRECTION TO BILL THEN THEY'RE REALIZING THE GOING OVER THE TEHACHAPI MOUNTAIN RANGES ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN B. TO GET THE TRAIN IN THE LOS ANGELES AS MISS MELINDA'S MENTIONED IT IS TIME TO DO WHAT A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS DESIRE INPUT HIGH SPEED RAIL BACK ON THE BALLOT. FOR VOTERS TO CONSIDER ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. HIS MIND IS YOU HAVE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO LIKE TO TESTIFY. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO TEST MY SUPPORTERS SO. OFFERS BILL. SEEN DONE ANY MEMBERS OF PUBLIC ELECT TESTIFYING OPPOSITION OF THE AUTHORS. DECISION IN EUROPE SOMETHING MISTER CHAIRMAN KEEPS DOWN ON BEHALF ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED TRAINS. ALWAYS FIND IT INTERESTING TO HEAR MY COLLEAGUE MISTER WOLF EXPAND UPON HIS KNOWLEDGE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AYE AYE HAVING TO LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS TO LAST WEEK PRESENT YOU WITH A BUSINESS PLAN TALKING ABOUT. EXCESS THAT THEY ARE LOOKING TOWARDS WITH THE NEW LEADERSHIP AT HIGH SPEED RAIL AMONG A COMMENT BRIEFLY ABOUT THE NOTION OF AIRPLANES WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR AIRSPACE MUCH LIKE OUR HIGHWAYS IS VERY CROWDED. THE NOTION THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE INCREASED AIRLINE TRAFFIC HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY NOT THE TRUTH WE HAVE MILITARY BASES WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEIR SPACE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE WHICH RESTRICT OUR ABILITY EXPAND THOSE. IN STATE AIRLINE MILES. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO SEE THE IMPACT THOSE BASES THAT ARE HUGE ECONOMIC ENGINES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. ALSO LIKE TO SAY THE LEADERSHIP HIGH SPEED RAIL WHO MANY OF YOU HEARD DO A PRESENTATION ON NEW BUSINESS PLAN HAVE A DIRECTION AND THE PLAN AND THE ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE VOTERS. I WOULD ALSO REMIND YOU THAT WE'VE HAD A VOTE ON HIGH SPEED RAIL THE VOTERS A FIRM THAT THEY WANT TO SEE HIGH SPEED RAIL. THEY HAVE HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY. PRESENTED TO THEM THEY RESPONDED AND THE NEW LEADERSHIP AT THE AUTHORITY IS MOVING FORWARD AND IS GOING TO MEET THE NEED. THAT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN DEMANDED BY THE VOTERS BUT ALSO IS GOING TO HELP US WITH OUR POLICY REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU HEAR HAVE SET WITH REGARDS TO REDUCING OUR CLIMATE IMPACT. SO. WITH RESPECT OUT ASK FOR YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I THINK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OR MAKE A COMMENT THIS BILL. SEEING NONE AT ANY. BUT ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS MISS HARPER. JUST AS I THINK I KIND OF A NOTED IN REGARDS TO THE LAST. THE LAST COMMENT. JUST AS A ROUND TRANSPORTATION WILL BE INVOLVING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES AIR TRANSPORTATION WILL B. INVOLVING OVER THE. NEXT FEW DECADES WE HAVE LOTS OF A. I AIR BASES THAT HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO COMMERCIAL USE. WHICH I PROBABLY WILL HAVE A LOT OF. UTILIZATION IN THE FUTURE AYE AS AIRCRAFT EVOLVE OVER TIME. MS BAKER. THANK YOU I END THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL ESPECIALLY WHEN WE DID LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY TO THE TESTIMONY LAST WEEK. IT WHICH OR THE PEER REVIEW AUTHORITY MENTIONED THAT IT IS THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GOING TO GO TWO HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE POINTS THAT IS A LITTLE BIT DISHEARTENING AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WE DO AS YOU'RE DOING TO SAY TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE A BETTER INVESTMENT OF THESE DOLLARS AND THERE'S LOTS OF LEGISLATION TO DO THAT BUT I'M APPRECIATIVE AND PROUD TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL THANK YOU FOR RAN FOR IT. OTHERS SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS. I CERTAINLY AGREE. THERE'S CLEARLY FUNDING GAPS IN SO I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR BILL. THAT WE HAVE A MOTION FROM. MISTER HARPER ANYTHING FROM SOME EVER BIGGER MASSACRE WOULD LIKE BECAUSE I'M. MIDDLE OF SCIENCE AND I APOLOGIZE WHICH ARE CLOSE. SO. NOW THAT EVERYBODY'S GOT IT OFF THEIR CHEST HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR BY SERVICE TO SCHOOLS. OKAY NOW I MENTIONED THE HIGH SPEED RAIL IN HERE ARE SOME OF OUR WITNESS BOTH FOR AND AGAINST. SPOKE. AT LENGTH ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT THE REALITY IS THIS IS ABOUT GETTING OUR KIDS TO AND FROM SCHOOL IN A SAFE AND EFFICIENT MANNER WE EVERY MEMBER HAS KIDS IN THEIR DISTRICT. WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING TO SCHOOL EITHER BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS CAN'T AFFORD? TO PAY FOR THE MONTHLY BUS FEE AND IT IS NOT CHEAP BY THE WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY PER CHILD NAM THAT FIVE THEM I CAN TELL YOU IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT AN INEXPENSIVE VENTURE I'M EITHER THEIR PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE SCHOOL BUS OR THEY'RE JUST WITHIN THAT CERTAIN DISTANCE WHERE THEY DON'T QUALIFY. TO GET ON THE BUS THEIR VARIETY OF REASONS ARE A LOT OF AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS IT'S NOT SAFE EVEN FOR THEM TO BE WALKING TO SCHOOL. SO WE'RE GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT FUNDS. MEAL PROGRAMS FOR KIDS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE FAT IN THEIR BRAINS HAD THE ENERGY THEY NEED TO LEARN DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO FIND MORE. RESOURCES FOR THE TEACHERS AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS INTO THE SCHOOLS. WHEN IT MAKES SENSE IF WE MADE SURE THE KIDS COULD ACTUALLY GET TO SCHOOL. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING I THINK THIS IS A NO BRAINER LET'S JUST GET THE KIDS TO SCHOOL VERY SIMPLE THAT'S THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES GETTING THEM THERE. THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING IS FOR THE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THESE KIDS GET TO SCHOOL SAID THEY CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PUT INTO PLACE. TO GREET THEM WHEN THEY WALK THROUGH THE DOORS AT THEIR SCHOOL EACH MORNING WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR ABOUT. BUT THE USE OF THE MEMBER. MA'AM SECTOR WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. FRAZIER. FONG FONG AYE AND WE ARE CURRY. BAKER. BAKER AYE BERMAN. BERMAN NOT VOTING CHIU. DALY. DALY NOT VOTING FRIEDMAN.

I SEE WHERE ASSEMBLYMEMBER EGGMAN I WILL NOW MOVE TO FILE ITEM TEN. AB TWENTY SIX WHEN I. PLEASE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MOON AND GOOD AFTERNOON DEVICE YOUR MEMBERS TODAY AND PRESENTING AB TWENTY STE SIX TWENTY NINE. WHICH IS A BILL TO ELIMINATE THE CODITION THAT AN AIR SPACE THAT WOULD THAT THAT THESE TWO AGENCIES LEAST BELOW WERE FREEWAY EXCHANGE IN MY DISTRICT. A BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION THE CITY STOCK DOES NOT EXCEED A TEN YEAR PERIOD RIGHT NOW IT IS EVERY TEN YEARS I HAVE TO RE RELEASE IT. RELEASED THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR AGENCIES WHO HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE THE EIGHTIES TO BE ABLE TO PLAN FOR LONG TERM PLANS. IT IS MAKES IT MUCH EASIER IF THEY ARE ABLE JUST TO CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD THERE ARE NO BUYERS FOR THIS. THIS AREA THAT SITS UNDERNEATH TO COURT TO FREEWAYS AS THEY CROSS OVER. AND SO EXISTING LAW RIGHT NOW REQUIRES A DO THAT EVERY TEN YEARS WE WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE THAT. AND WITH ME HERE TODAY HAVE EDWARD FIGUEROA BEHALF OF SAINT MARY'S DINING HALL AND RAY CALL HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STOCKTON SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS AND AS WE ALL KNOW. AS WERE OUT WORKING TOWARDS TRYING TO DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS HOMELESS ISSUE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE PROVIDING THIS CARE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO.

I HIGH OTHER STOCKTON SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS HAS BEEN SERVING THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY HOMELESS POPULATION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. OUR CAPACITY HAS GROWN STEADILY OVER THE YEARS FOR SERVING ONLY MEN THAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY. AT OUR CURRENT CAPACITIES THREE HUNDRED PER NIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY THIS NEED IS GREATER THAN OUR CAPACITY. SO ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT WE MAY HAVE. SIXTY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SLEEPING ON MATS ON THE FLOOR AND OR MULTIPLE MOBILE MULTIPURPOSE ROOMS. WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND OUR SHOULDER CAPACITY ON SITE BUT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE PROPERTY WE ARE RELUCTANT TO EXPAND OUR EMERGENCY. SHELTER CAPABILITIES THE CURRENT SHORT LEASE TIMES MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CONDUCT CAPITAL CAMPAIGNS TO RAISE FUNDING FOR THE FOR MORE SHELTER BUILDINGS. THE SHORT LEASE TIMES ALSO CAUSES TO HAVE TO JUSTIFY OUR NEED FOR MORE LEAST TIME EVERY. TIME THE LEASE COMES UP BECAUSE OF US TAKE ATTENTION AWAY. FROM THE DAILY NEEDS AT THE SHELTER. APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION FOR PROVING AB TWO SIX TO NINE WHICH WOULD EXTEND OUR LEASE ALLOW US MORE STE STABILITY IN PROVIDING OUR SERVICE TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION. AND SO WE CAN GET. THE NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M EDWARD FIGUEROA CEO FOR ST MARY'S DINING ROOM AND ST MARY'S DINING ROOM HAS BEEN PROVIDING CARE TO OUR COMMUNITIES HOMELESS SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE AND DOING SO IN OUR CURRENT LOCATION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX UNDER THE CROSSTOWN FREEWAY.

THIRTEEN A BETWEEN NINE EIGHTEEN. A PLEASE BEGIN WE READY. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE A TEAM WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO INCLUDE IN THE CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S HANDBOOK INFORMATION. REGARDING A PERSON CIVIL RIGHTS DURING A TRAFFIC STOP. THE DRIVER'S HANDBOOK INCLUDES SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO CONDUCT ONESELF DURING A STOP. BUT STOPPED SHORT OF STATING THE RIGHTS OF THE DRIVER AND WHAT TO DO IF THE SITUATION IS ESCALATING. BEING INFORMED OF THESE RIGHTS ARE CRITICAL IN SITUATIONS THAT CAN QUICKLY GO FROM CALM TO WORSE. STUDIES SHOW THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA ARE MOST AFFECTED BY TRAFFIC STOPS. AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTEEN CELL ADDRESS THE EXTENT AND LIMITATIONS OF THE PEACE OFFICER'S AUTHORITY DURING A TRAFFIC STOP. THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS AND DETAILS ON THE PROCESS FOR FILING COMPLAINTS AGAINST A PEACE OFFICER. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE DEVELOPED BY THE DMV AFTER CONSULTING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND CIVIL JUSTICE. LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I'VE. I GIVING INDIVIDUALS SPEAKING IN SOME SUPPORT. YEAH. I'D TIFFANY PULLEYBLANK WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR THIS BILL. CENA ANY IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE ARE THERE ANY. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE BILL. OKAY WE. HAVE A MOTION. OKAY MISS HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOHN. NOW I UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR THE BILL AND. VERY MUCH AGREE THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE UP PROMOTION AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE DO HAVE THE QUESTION I DO HAVE. A RIGHT WHEN IT COMES OF THIS BILL IS IS THIS THE RIGHT VENUE. TO BE DOING SO WHY IS THIS SITE EDUCATION BEST DONE BY IS A PART OF THE DMV EXERCISE. THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT OR IS IT BETTER DONE. THROUGH. CITIZENS ORGANIZATIONS. AND BOTTOM UP AND SO IF YOU CAN GIVE SOME REFLECTIVE THOUGHTS ON ON WHAT YOU THINK I'M WILLING TO LISTEN UP BUT THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT VENUE OR. OR IS ANOTHER BIT MORE APPROPRIATE THAT MAY BE LESS GOVERNMENT SENT. YEAH WELL I THINK I THINK CERTAINLY ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS YOU. CAN REALLY ATTACK THE ISSUE FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES AND AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND CERTAINLY HAVING DMV ENGAGED ON. OF BEING A PART OF THE DISSEMINATED OF INFORMATION TO HELP. EDUCATE. OF THE DRIVING PUBLIC. BUT ALSO IT IS IN A TWO WEEKS. OF STREET IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY NO PUN INTENDED VERSUS OPPORTUNITY FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SORT OF BE ENGAGED IN THAT CREATES A BETTER DIALOGUE INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SHARING. A TOO OFTEN WE SEE. CONFLICTS HAPPEN AND MAYBE THEY DID NOT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE BEEN. REDUCED BASED ON INFORMATION AND HOW BEST TO ENGAGE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO WE THINK THAT THERE IS A ROLE THAT THE DMV CAN PLAY WE'RE LOOKING TO THE DMV TO. UMPS TO HELP DRAFT WHAT THIS APPROACH WITH LOOK LIKE AND THE LANGUAGE AND SO I THINK THAT BY ENGAGING THEM HAVING THEM VIA STAKEHOLDER IN THE PROCESS I THINK THAT ALLOWS US TO. GET THE MAXIMUM OUT OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT. BUT THAT'S ALSO THE START TO SAY THAT THERE AREN'T. COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORTS AND OTHER. EDUCATIONAL VENUES WHERE DISCUSSION AND INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED BUT WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LICENSE TO OPERATE VEHICLE ON THE ROAD. THIS IS AN ELEMENT OF. I THINK THE CONVERSATION THAT GIVES US A. A MORE APPROPRIATE OR A BETTER VEHICLE OUT TO SHARE. OF THE INFORMATION APPROPRIATELY AND AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THIS IS LEGISLATION THAT WE. HAVE. PICKED UP FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS. WHERE? HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND IT WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND ENGAGING THE PUBLIC. THAT I THINK. MORE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE THE BETTER THOUGH BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO OPERATE. INDIVIDUALITY OF A TRAFFIC STOP. AND NOT TO CREATED DYNAMIC WHICH WOULD CAUSE. AN ESCALATION. I IN THE SITUATION. AND JUST THE FEEDBACK THAT I'LL HAVE IS HIGH I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ANSWER TODAY. ALLEN TEND TO HOLD OFF BUT I'LL BE LISTENING. TO STAKEHOLDERS TO CITIZENS SIDE AND TO OTHER PARTIES AYE IS THE PROPOSAL PERHAPS INVOLVES OR PERHAPS I GET MORE INPUT ON IT. IF WE NEED DAY MAY COME TO THE FLOOR SOME OTHER PART. OF THE PROCESS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ITS REPRESENT WHICH. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. OF WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. OF AS I SAY I THINK IT'S OF AN IMPORTANT A NEXT STEP APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC AND HOW TO. INFORM ON HOW ON TRAFFIC STOPS TO. AVERT ESCALATION AND POTENTIAL ISSUES THAT ARISE FROM TRAFFIC STOPS AND MISUNDERSTANDING SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE AUTHORS BILL. I WAS AS CLOSE AS WE'RE PAST THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT HEADS UP IN. MISTER HOLMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE. IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR DRIVERS WHO UNDERSTAND THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS WHEN THEY ARE BEING PULLED OVER. HOWEVER I QUESTION IF THE DMV HANDBOOK IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO HAVE INFORMATION. ON HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER. NONE THE LESS I WOULD SUPPORT A BILL TODAY. AND. LOOK TO WORKING WITH YOU HAN MOVING THIS FORWARD.

THE ESTIMATED SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATE APPROXIMATE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS USING JOB ORDER CONTRACTING. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE CALTRANS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO UTILIZE THIS PROCUREMENT PROCESS ACCORDING TO ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES SET BY CALTRANS. TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY AB TWENTY NINE NINETY SIX WILL REQUIRE CALTRANS TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE DEAL DETAILING THE STATE OF ALL CURRENT. AND EXPIRED CONTRACTS.

MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE NINETEEN WHICH AIMS TO CREATE CERTAINTY AND PREDICTABILITY FOR VITAL TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. BY REQUIRING ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS TO BE APPROVED WITHIN TWO YEARS. TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS CAN TAKE MANY YEARS TO BE COMPLETED DUE TO THE MULTI STAGE DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW PROCESS THAT INCLUDES INVITE HIM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REVIEW AND MITIGATION. DESIGN AND ENGINEERING RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITION FINANCING CONSTRUCTION PERMITTING AND OTHER RELATED REQUIREMENTS. ONE ASPECT OF THE TRANSPORTATION DELIVERY PROCESS IS. IS THE PERMITTING OF PROJECTS FROM VARIOUS RESOURCE AGENCIES. ANECDOTALLY IT WOULD TAKE A PROJECT SPONSOR MONTHS TO TWO YEARS TO GET THE FINAL PERMIT APPROVAL FROM THESE AGENCIES. OFTENTIMES PROJECT SPONSORS AND AGENCIES GO BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH. AND BACK AND FORTH. WITH NO REAL CERTAINTY OF WHEN THE PERMIT WILL BE APPROVED. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO MOVE PROJECTS FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S NO REAL DATA TO SHOW HOW THESE DELAYS ARE AFFECTING PROJECT DELIVERY IN INCREASING. OUR PROJECT COSTS DRAMATICALLY. MY GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS NOT TO UNDERMINE OUR ENVIRONMENT AYE AYE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. AND I NO THIS BILL IS NOT THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER THIS BILL SERVES AS A VEHICLE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH KEY EXPERTS TO BETTER ADDRESS PROJECT DELAYS. REDUCE COST AND OVERALL. PROVIDE THE CERTAINLY NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY DELIVER PROJECTS WHILE PROTECTING. THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS BILL ALSO ENSURES THAT STATE AGENCIES CONVENE. THAT THE.

WITH THIS LEGISLATION IT'S IN TROUBLE TRYING TO GET AN EFFICIENT TIMELINE TO DELIVER THESE PROJECTS. SAVE MONEY AND HAVE THE PUBLIC ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF PUTTING THEIR TAX DOLLARS TO YOU SO WITH THE FORTY CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION I AM ALSO REACHING OUT TO OTHER TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES. TO ASSESS AND ARE DESCRIBED DIFFICULTIES THAT THEY'RE FACING TO HELP BOB MOVE THIS BILL FORD SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY. I THINK THE MUCH.
