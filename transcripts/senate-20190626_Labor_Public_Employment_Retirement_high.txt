FOURTEEN SIXTY SIX A SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE -- ENOUGH OF MEMBERS HERE FOR A QUORUM WE WILL. BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND START WITH OUR FIRST BILL ITEM NUMBER ONE AB THREE FOURTEEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE SO PROMPTLY MORNING AFTER MORNING PLEASE FOR HOLLY AND STAFF THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB THREE ONE FOUR AND THANKS FOR THE WORK AB THREE ONE FOUR WOULD UNIFORMLY APPLY A FLOOR. FOR REASONABLE RELEASE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF COMPENSATION TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. AND PROVIDE CLARITY ON SPECIFIC DUTIES ALLOWED DURING. RELEASE TIME UNDER EXISTING LAW PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO ALLOW EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES. QUOTE UNQUOTE REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF COMPENSATION TO PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS SUCH AS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND MATTERS BEFORE PERSONNEL COMMISSIONS THIS IS REFERRED TO AS RELEASE TIME. IN PREVIOUS YEARS TO HAVE BEEN A GROWING NUMBER OF ATTACKS ON WORKERS RIGHTS TO THWART THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THEIR COLLECTIVE POWER. OTHER CALIFORNIA HAS A POLICY OF PROVIDING REASONABLE TIME OFF WITHOUT LOSS OF PAY TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. THE LAW IS INEFFECTIVE IN ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO MEANINGFULLY PARTICIPATE IN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONS BECAUSE CURRENT LAW IS INCONSISTENT. ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS OF EMPLOYMENT AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT CONSISTENCY THAT CERTAINTY THAT UNIFORMITY. IN ORDER FOR PUBLIC INPUT TO BENEFIT FROM THE RIGHTS TO REPRESENTATION THEY NEED TO BE CERTAIN OF THEIR PAID TIME OFF ALLOWANCES AB THREE ONE FOUR WITH LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES BY CREATING THAT UNIFORMITY ACROSS ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SECTOR LABOR RELATION LAWS I RECKON ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES EQUAL RIGHTS TO REASONABLE. PAID TIME OFF TO ENGAGE IN SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MICHELLE CASTRO. SEIU SPONSOR OF THE BILL THANK YOU SHOULD REMEMBER BONTA AND WE ARE GOING TO LIMIT ADDITIONALLY TO FIVE MINUTES FOR OF SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE SHOT HOUSE OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. I MUST MISTER BONTA SAID THIS IS A MEASURE OF BUILDING OFF OF EXISTING LAW IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT -- RIGHT TO RELEASE TIME. AND NOT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING HOWEVER SOME EMPLOYERS. HAVE AGREED TO MORE RELEASE TIME IN THE STATUE ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN THE STATUTE. BUT THIS BILL REALLY DOES IS ATTEMPT TO LEVEL PLAYING GROUND BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. CURRENT LAW LIMITS A SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE AMOUNT OF RELEASE TIME HOWEVER EMPLOYERS. CAN ASSIGN AS MANY STAFF AS THEY LIKE -- TO ENSURE THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE RICH -- REPRESENT AN EMPLOYER RELATIONS THEY CAN HIRE OUTSIDE ATTORNEYS THEY CAN ASSIGN THEIR STAFF FULL TIME SO THEY ARE AT A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER EMPLOYEES THIS BILL JUST ATTEMPTS TO SAY WE'RE GONNA TRY TO EVEN THINGS OUT A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GIVE EMPLOYEES UNLIMITED MA'AM TIMES SAYS. A REASONABLE PLEASE MAY BE GRANTED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND THEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE UNION NEGOTIATE FOR WHAT IS REASONABLE BECAUSE WHAT IS REASONABLE MENDOCINO. MAY NOT BE REASONABLE LOS ANGELES SO IT'S KIND OF A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN BARGAINING AND THE STATUTE WHICH WHAT. WE ASK. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING JOSH THE PROCESS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION FOR A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AND I SAID BEEN STATED THIS PROVIDES UNIFORMITY AND PROVIDE THE CLARITY DEBT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD IN TERMS OF RELEASE TIME. AND THIS PER ENSURES THAT THAT DEPLOYS NOW HAVE IT SPELLED OUT AND IN A UNIFORM PROCESS WITHIN A SINGLE STATUTE. AS OPPOSED TO BEING SPREAD OUT. VARIOUS THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS PAT MARATHON READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SITE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE BILL FOR REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU COMMISSIONER AND CREATE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GOOD MORNING [inaudible] MORNING. HERE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEALING GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SEE SACK WHICH ARE IN THE ASSEMBLY PURRS COMMITTEE -- RIGHT NOW. WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THIS LEGISLATION WHAT WE FOUND. MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL TO BE REASONABLE AND COMMON PRACTICE. AMONGST OUR ORGANIZATIONS. THE SPECIFIC PROVISION AS IT RELATES TO EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION IS WHERE WE HAVE CONCERNS. THAT PROVISION WAS NEGOTIATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND WAS. PASSED AS PART OF A TRAILER BILL THAT THOSE NEGATION NEGOTIATIONS TOOK PLACE BETWEEN. THE ADMINISTRATION THE PUBLIC AGENCIES. N. LABOR. AND ONCE THAT WAS. ONCE AGREEMENT WAS COMPLETED WAS PUT IN AB. ONE NINETEEN AND THAT BILL WAS SUPPORTED BY LABOR -- THE PROVISION AS FAR AS RELEASE TIME WAS A VERY SPECIFIC PROVISION THAT WAS NEGOTIATED. THE E. EMPLOYERS -- THE THE THE PURPOSE OF INSURING THAT WOULD STATE IN THE M. O. U.. WAS RECOGNITION THAT EMPLOYERS FAIRY AND SIZE AND SCOPE. SO WITH SOME OF OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES SOME OF OUR SPECIAL DISTRICT WE MIGHT HAVE NINE UNION EMPLOYEES TOTAL. OTHERS HAVE THOUSANDS -- THE THE AGENCY WITH NINE EMPLOYEES MIGHT DO ONE ORIENTATION. FOR THE ONE NEW EMPLOYEE THEY GET EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS. WHERE AS SOME OF OUR LARGER EMPLOYERS MAYBE YOU'VE GOT TWELVE DIFFERENT BARGAINING UNITS? THEY'RE HAVING ORIENTATIONS EVERY SINGLE WEEK. AND SO THE THE REASON THAT THAT THAT PROVISION DIDN'T INCLUDE -- RELEASE TIME AN AUTOMATIC PAY FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES. WHAT'S THE THEY CAN NEGOTIATE AND WORK OUT AN AGREEMENT AMONGST THE PUBLIC AGENCIES. DEPENDING ON THE NEEDS. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN WORKING -- WE'VE BEEN HAD WE'VE HAD THE ORIENTATIONS IN FOR TWO YEARS -- NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE ORIENTATIONS HAVE GONE TO BINDING ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE. DIFFERENCES AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN REACH AN AGREEMENT ON HOW THIS ORIENTATIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE WERE WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE OR HOW IT HAPPENED. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST THAT WE DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH AND GOES BACK ON AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE. JUST TWO YEARS AGO FOR THOSE REASONS WE'RE OPPOSE LESS MET WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS HERE IN OPPOSITION. SEEN NO -- ONE FEEDBACK THE OPPOSITION I'M SORRY ELIZABETH THAT'S ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WE'RE STUCK OUTSIDE RUNNING SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT IN SUPPORT THANK YOU -- DOES RING OUT OF ORDER SEPTEMBER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT.

THAT IS WELL JAKE OF RECORD FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS FROM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN EITHER SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION I'M SURE BUT THE OTHER THE OTHER OPPOSITE ENDS OUTSIDE. RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE. THE DOOR DOWN. BANGING ON THE DOOR -- ARE WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND MISSED BUT IF YOU MAYBE WOULDN'T RESPOND. TO THE TWO I REMEMBER THE LEGISLATION TWO YEARS AGO AND THE AGREEMENT THAT. AND OF SIGNED ON TO AND WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. YEAH I'D LIKE TO RESPOND ACTUALLY THE AGREEMENT REGARDING RELEASE TIME WITH NOT IN AB. ONE NINETEEN THE THERE WAS A DISCUSSION THE YEAR PRIOR OVER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WAS NOT SIGNED IN ENACTED. AB ONE NINETEEN WAS ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL BY. GOVERNOR BROWN WHICH WE ALL THAT AGREED TO WAS NOT A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT THE YEAR PRIOR WAS A DIFFERENT BILL AND THAT WAS NEGOTIATED -- SINCE THAT TIME. EVERY PUBLIC EMPLOYER HAS AGREED TO RELEASE TIME. FOR NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION SO ALLOW PLACE -- WANNA CORRECT THERE HAS BEEN ARBITRATIONS OVER EMPLOYERS REFUSING TO GRANT -- EMPLOYEES RELEASE TIME. AND ALL THOSE ARBITRATIONS OVERWHELMINGLY SAID YOU MUST GRANT EMPLOYEES TIME TO PARTICIPATE RELEASE TIME AND YOU MUST PAY THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CODIFYING ALREADY WET. ARBITRATORS HAVE BROUGHT. D. V. D. ARBITRATION WAS. TO THE ORIENTATION IS THE WORK. TO THE YOUR YES THEY WERE. IF THAT'S THE CASE I STAND CORRECTED. FOR YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN. NINE NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION OFFLINE -- OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY YOU KNOW WHAT WAS TO GO SHE TO WHAT WAS DISCUSSED WHAT WAS NOT BUT I I THINK WHAT WE WILL. END UP SEEING IS THAT FOR A NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE -- PLACE WHERE RELEASE TIME SHOULD BE GIVEN AN AND IT'S GIVEN. MOST EVERYWHERE TODAY BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CONSISTENCY THAT UNIFORMITY THAT -- THAT CERTAINTY THAT CLARITY AND THAT BUILT THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T -- PROVIDE A ANY MASSIVE CHANGES IN SUCH SUBSTANTIVE. LAW BUT IT DOES CLARIFY GREAT CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES I SO IT'S NEEDED AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION RESPECTFULLY ASK DR OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA APPRECIATE THAT AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WE WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION AND TAKE THE BILL. UP THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE TEST THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU STOP THANK YOU -- WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVEL. WELCOME GOOD MORNING. ALL THESE PEOPLE HERE TO SEE YOU. THE YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE YOU. IT IN EVERY JUST A CAR WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER FOR A BE A THREE SEVENTY EIGHT RECEIVED WHEN YOU CHAIR AND WILL COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I FIRST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS. AB THREE SEVEN EIGHT SIX SIX TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE CAREER PATHWAY AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO EDUCATE AND CARE FOR OUR EARLIEST LEARNERS CALIFORNIA'S EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION WORK FIRST IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF WOMEN AND PREDOMINANTLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THIS IS A WORKFORCE THAT OFTEN DOES NOT EARN A LIVABLE WAGE AND QUALIFIES FOR THE SAME SUBSIDIES THAT THE FAMILIES THEY SERVE USE. STABILITY IS BROUGHT TO THE EASY WORK FORCE WHEN A SOLID FOUNDATION IN QUALITY AND REIMBURSEMENT IS IN PLACE AND WE KNOW WHEN FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE. PARENTS ARE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN THE WORKFORCE AND CHILDREN ARE SET UP TO SIXTY LEADER IN EDUCATION AND IN LIFE. THE ASSEMBLY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON CHILD CARE WORKED TIRELESSLY OVER TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT EASY WORK FIRST ONE OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO SUPPORT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE. HOME PROVIDERS WAS LICENSE AND FAMILY FRIEND AND NEIGHBOR. CALIFORNIA RUNS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR A DAY WORKFORCE BUT OUR CHILD CARE OPTIONS FOR WORKING FAMILIES DO NOT MEET THAT NEED NOR SUPPORT THOSE WHO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE. THIS BILL PROFESSIONAL EYES IS AND CREATE STABILITY FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY MAKING QUALITY TRAINING AVAILABLE TO PROVIDERS THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AB THREE SEVENTY EIGHT PROVIDES A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS BOTH PROVIDER PAY INEQUITY AND THE LACK OF ACCESSIBLE CHILDCARE. THERE ARE AMENDMENTS BEFORE YOU THAT WILL ULTIMATELY AT A CO AUTHORS AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT A LINE THE BILL WITH THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. ALSO IT'S REFLECTS STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNS ABOUT INCLUSION JOINING ME TODAY IS HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AMMASH A GRIFFIN A CHILD CARE PROVIDER FROM APPLE VALLEY AND THE ON AIR INNER WHO. IS REPRESENTING SCA EVEN ASKED ME AND HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS MANY MAY HAVE VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH WELCOME. MORNING MY NAME IS THE MEASURE GRIFFIN AND FOR THE PAST EIGHTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER IN THE APPLE VALLEY VICTORVILLE AREA. I AM ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE VICTOR VALLEY CHILD CARE ASSOCIATION AND HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I CURRENTLY CARE FOR FOR TEN CHILDREN EIGHT OF WHICH ARE ON STATE SUBSIDY I ALSO HAVE THREE CHILDREN OF MY OWN. FIFTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY SEVEN I AM ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF AT THE AYE YOU LOCAL NINETY NINE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN. NINE I LIKE FORTY THOUSAND FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE PORK COUNTLESS HOURS NURTURING AND EDUCATING INFANTS. TODDLERS AND SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY WORK BECAUSE EVERY DAY I GET TO HELP OUR YOUNGEST MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN THE FILL THEIR POTENTIAL. BUT THERE IS A TROUBLE INSIDE TO CHILD CARE BEYOND DIRTY DIAPERS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS MANY DON'T SEE. WHILE I SUPPORT WORKING PARENTS VERY STRONGLY SO THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES CAN FOR THEIR MOST VALUABLE TREASURES. THEIR CHILDREN I ALSO STRUGGLE WITH POVERTY WAGES. THIS DECISION MAKERS SAY I DO VALUABLE WORK BUT THE LAW AND MY REALITY SAY OTHERWISE. THE LAW MAKES PROVIDERS BILL DISPOSABLE. BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WORTHY OF BASIC PROTECTIONS LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION I AM AN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR AND THE STATE WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. IN THE WORLD YES I DO NOT EARN A LIVING WAGE INSTEAD AT SOME POINTS PROVIDERS CAN QUALIFY FOR THE SAME CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES THAT I PROVIDE. CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE THESE HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY DID FOR ME AND TWO THOUSAND NINE I WAS CLOSE TO LOSING MY HOME. BECAUSE I WAS NOT BEING PAID ON TIME AND SUFFER FROM LOW ENROLLMENT WHILE LOSE SOMEONE'S HOME IS HARD ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDER IT IS COMPLETELY TRAUMATIC. IF WE LOSE OUR HOMES WE LOSE OUR LIVELIHOOD AND DEPRIVE OUR EARLY CHILD CARE EDUCATION. MY STORY IS ONE OF MANY AND A GLARING EXAMPLE OF THE DEEP CRACKS IN CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY IMPACT FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. BUT OUR CHILDREN AND PARENTS. WHO RELY ON US? THAT'S WHY I LIKE CHILDCARE PROVIDER. THAT'S WHY I LIKE MY CHILD CARE PROVIDER SISTER SITTING BEHIND ME FROM AS SEE I YOU LOCAL FIVE TWENTY ONE AND YOU D. W.

JIM LIMBURG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING HIGH AND DRY RIVERA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ADAM GRAY NAM POSH COUNTY CO CHAIR I BORN DO YOU W. -- ALSO IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE SEVEN EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MA'AM THAT MINING MY NAME IS GLORIA I'M WOULD YOU THE W. AND I AM HERE TO SUPPORT AB. SEVENTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT THAT DAVE MISSED. I THINK WE GOT EVERYONE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY I KNOW YOU TRAVELED A LONG DISTANCE IN. IS NOT EASY TO DO THAT -- ESPECIALLY TODAY AND BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL IT'S A NICE STORE IT FILLED. AND AND I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT YOU TRAVEL FROM ALL OVER THE STATE TO TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS WITH US TODAY SO THANK YOU IT'S VERY VERY POWERFUL WHEN YOU DO THAT THAT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THIS LEGISLATION SEE NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION SENATOR JACKSON'S. YEAH HEY WE'RE UNION AGAIN. WE HAVE THIS TIME WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS I WOULD BE INTERESTED IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH US. HOW YOU SEE THE THE CHILD CARE PROVIDER WORLD CHANGING? AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL. SURE ALL STAR EVENT ONE OF THE EIGHT THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO CHILD CARE WITHOUT A CHILD CARE WORKER. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE NEED OF CHILD CARE FOR OUR STATE WHICH WE KNOW IS. REALLY SOMETHING THAT I'M ALL OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE WORKERS IT IS NOT OKAY FOR WORKERS TO BE PAID. LESS THAN WHAT A FAST FOOD WORKER MAKES IT IS NOT OKAY FOR WORKER TO BE PAID LESS THAN WHAT MINIMUM WAGE WITH. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR SO WE SEE A STRONGER WORKFORCE THAT WILL HELP CHILD CARE ALTOGETHER WE SEE IT -- A WORK FORCE THAT REALLY CAN BECOME A PROFESSION WHERE THOSE WHO SERVE WILL NOT BE USING THE SAME SUBSIDIES -- OF THE STUDENTS THAT THEY SEE IN ARE THE KIDS THAT THEY SEE IN THE CHILD CARE SPACE OF THIS IS REALLY ABOUT STRENGTHENING THE WORKER WHICH IN TURN STRENGTHENS CHILD KERR ALTOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA. COULD YOU. COULD YOU GOING HELLO YEAH SO I THINK THERE'S A THIRD PARTY ON ERROR ON BEHALF OF YOUR D. W. AN S. C. ARE YOU. THERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. A QUE RIGHT WAGES ARMED REGARDING BENEFITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT TO THE PEOPLE CAN TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES -- AND THERE'S ALSO A RELATIONSHIP TO THE QUALITY OF CARE THAT'S PROVIDED OKAY -- A YOUNG TO IN THAT LINKS TO THE TRAINING THAT WORKERS ARE PROVIDED. AND RIGHT NOW I'M WORKERS HAVE VERY LITTLE ACCESS TO TRAINING EXCEPT THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET IN ORDER TO GET A LICENSE FOR EXAMPLE ALL RIGHT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRING NOW THAT THERE BE MORE TRAINING NOT ONLY FOR LICENSED PROVIDERS THAT OFFER FROM WHAT ALSO FOR WHAT WE CALL LICENSE EXEMPT PROVIDERS WHICH ARE FAMILY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT VERY CLEARLY SAYS PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHO TAKES CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. RIGHT WHEN I DON'T GET THE RIGHT TO TELL THEM WHO THAT IS THEY GET TO CHOOSE AND SO WE PROVIDE A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WE CALL IT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE RIGHT IN RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF THE PROVIDER OF THE PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THE CARE? IS ALSO TO SAY RIGHT THROUGH WE HOPE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT RIGHT BECAUSE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS ALL ABOUT EVERYBODY IT'S ABOUT RESPECT. IT'S ABOUT COMING TO THE TABLE I'M AS EQUAL AS YOU CAN COM ALRIGHT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE STATE PAYS SUBSIDY ALL RIGHT. BUT IT'S OUT OF RESPECT THAT YOU SIT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION SO THAT YOU HOPEFULLY CAN MUTUALLY AGREED TO WHAT ARE WHAT ARE APPROPRIATE WAGES RIGHT GIVEN WITH IN THE THE GUIDELINES OF THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WHATEVER IS AGREED TO IN A MEMORANDUM UNDERSTANDING IS GONNA COME BACK TO THIS. LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL ALL RIGHT -- BUT ALSO TO LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE TRAINING NEED TO THE PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE AS THEIR TRAINING NEEDS. VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU NEED IN ORDER TO BECOME -- AND PROVE PROVIDER RIGHT SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY HAS AND IT HAS A BACKGROUND IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAS A CLUE TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING ALSO HAS A WAY OF PROTECTING THEMSELVES ONE OF THE THINGS THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN LATELY IS OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES. BECAUSE WE'VE ALL BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF KIDS RIGHT RIGHTFULLY SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE SURE THAT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY IS PROTECTED WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THE WORKERS WHO PROVIDE THE CARE OF THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY IS PROTECTED AS WELL AND SO WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING. TO OUR PROVIDERS THEY LOVE IT OKAY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THEY LOVE IT. IS BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO BE TRAINED BY THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK AS WELL AND SO THE USE CARE TRAINERS THAT KIND OF THING SO THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF IDEAS THAT PROVIDERS HAVE THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN ASKED. RIGHT WHAT DO THEY THINK SHOULD HAPPEN HOW THEY THINK THEY SHOULD BE TRAINED WHAT DO THEY WANT RIGHT TO SOME OF THEM. JUST WANT TO HAVE JUST WANT TO HAVE THE VERY BASIC TRAINING OKAY OTHERS WANT TO HAVE POSSIBLY IN A A DEGREE SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GO WANT TO BE A HAVE A BACHELOR'S RIGHT AS ART YES OUR PRINTER TESTIFIED -- BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ASKED THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY WE BELIEVE A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONVERSATION. TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROVIDERS THINK THAT THEY NEED. I'M ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO REALIZE WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES THAT WE I'D SERVICES. TO AND WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC IN REGARDS TO WHATEVER LEGISLATION IS PASSED WHAT YOU ALL THINK OUR REQUIREMENTS WELL. SO BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT IN THE END IS IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR KIDS. TO MAKE THEM PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S THE KIND OF THE BOTTOM LINE THAT I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I WAS HOPING MY ONLY OTHER QUESTION IS -- WE NEED TO PAY THERE'S BEEN A SORT OF A CHICKEN AND EGG ISSUE HERE -- SO WE'RE GONNA GET. AND YOU KNOW I NOTED THAT EVERY. CHILD CARE PROVIDER HERE THIS WAS SMILING. AND I WAS THINKING WHAT A WELCOME. THING WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING YOUR KIDS TO CHILD CARE TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S. WHO'S YOU KNOW WHO LOVES WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- I WISH FOR ALL OF US HERE. WALKING WITH SMILES EVERY DAY. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T QUITE HAPPEN -- BUT SO WE ARE GOING TO VALUE BY BY THIS PROCESS CREATE GREATER VALUE TO THE PEOPLE DOING THE SERVICES AND GREATER VALUE TO THE CHILDREN THROUGH TRAINING AND AND RESPECT AS YOU SAY. THE COST SO WE KNOW THAT PROVIDING CHILDCARE TODAY WHETHER IT'S SUBSIDIZED CARE OR WHETHER IT'S PEOPLE'S PAYING THEIR OWN CARE. IS IT IS I WOULD SAY OWNERS BUT IT IS CHALLENGING. HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YES INDEED THE COST MAY GO UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW GOD FORBID WE'RE GOING TO PAY THE? PEOPLE ARE DOING THE JOB MORE THAN SLAVE WAGES HOW DO WE ADDRESS HOW DO YOU ENVISION US ADDRESSING THAT PROBLEM GOING FORWARD. ONE IS. THIRTY ONE IT'S AN EASY QUESTION I KNOW RIGHT RIGHT YEAH BECAUSE THERE THERE ARE TWO ISSUES HERE RIGHT ONE IS IS THE RATE MAKING THE RATE STRUCTURE OKAY AND WE HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED RATE STRUCTURE THAT WE WILL GO INTO TODAY BECAUSE I BECAUSE ALL YOU DO WAS SCREAM. AT US AND SAY YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING THAT IS IT'S TOO COMPLICATED FOR US TO UNDERSTAND DO IT DO IT SIMPLER YOU WANT. ME TO COMPLICATE WE MAKE ME MAD YES NO. RIGHT AND THERE'S A BILL MOVING THROUGH THAT WE HOPE WILL SIMPLIFY THAT RATE STRUCTURE OKAY -- HAVING SAID THAT THOUGH MORE MONEY IS NEEDED OKAY AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES AND NOT ONLY DOES THE MORE MONEY NEED FOR THE WAGES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM. WE HAVE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES AND ARE NOT RECEIVING THEM. OKAY WE'RE NOT EVEN I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT UNIVERSALITY FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO WHO WHO IF THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY. WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES TODAY THAT MEANS OF THEIR FAMILIES ARE EITHER STRUGGLING THERE EITHER NOT WORKING OKAY WHEN THEY COULD BE WORKING. OR THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS OR THEY HAVE THEIR GRANDPARENTS OR THEY HAVE A FRIEND OR WHATEVER. CHILDREN ARE AT HOME ALONE RIGHT THE TERM THAT WE'VE USED FOR YEARS AS LATCHKEY KIDS. THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS PROPOSITION -- RIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN STAYING AT HOME BY THEMSELVES. I'M I DON'T WANT TO USE THE ANALOGY BUT WE JUST BEEN READING ABOUT IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE IMMIGRANT CENTER IN. TEXAS ARE. BUT IT IS A PRETTY GOOD ANALOGY OF KIDS TAKING CARE OF KIDS OKAY. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IN IN THE UNION CERTAINLY IS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL OF YOU ABOUT. WE WILL AT SOME POINT ARE GOING TO NEED A PERMANENT REVENUE STREAM YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS. BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING FOR THIS IN THE END I MEAN DR PANOS AS I HEAR TALK ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME. IN THAT WHAT YOU DON'T DO AN EASY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION YOU PAY FOR DOWN THE ROAD OKAY YOU FIRST OF ALL HAVE A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER WHO SAYS WHAT'S GOING ON HERE I HAVE TEN KIDS THAT ARE. READY TO READ AND I'VE GOT YOU KNOW TEN OTHER KIDS WHO CAN BARELY YOU KNOW PUT IT TOGETHER RIGHT AND SO SHE OR HE MOSTLY SHE IS SITTING THERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FASHION. LESSON PLANS FOR TWO VERY DISTINCT GROUPS OF KIDS ARE RIGHT TO BY THE THIRD GRADE YOU ALL HEARD THIS RIGHT IF THEY AREN'T READING. WE HAVE ISSUES OKAY AND SO. IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE AS A SOCIETY HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BUT BUT IT THIS IS THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS RIGHT IS HEARING FROM THE VERY PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THAT CARE. WHAT DO THEY THINK IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF WHAT THEY DELIVER TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM? THANK YOU THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED. TO THANKS AND HAVE BEEN. THANK YOU WELL -- FIRST BY ONE THANK YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD. HE JUST MADE ONE MY POINTS FOR ME -- ANY THIS REALLY. YEAH YEAH WELL I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S A REALLY QUESTION OF VALUE. RIGHT SO WE TALK ABOUT THE COST BUT WE DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT THE VALUE AND VALUE TO US AND ALSO -- MAKE NOTE THAT -- THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO CHILD CARE WORK IS ARE WORKING AND IS THE ENVIRONMENT ARE YOUNG TOLD. THE SAME ENVIRONMENT SO -- WE NEED TO EMPOWER THE PEOPLE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR CHILDREN THEY ARE OUR CHILDREN AFTER ALL -- TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE CHILDREN AND THEMSELVES BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME IT'S NOT A SELFISH JUST FOR ME IT'S THE SAME ENVIRONMENT THE KIDS ARE AND AND SO -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT TEST MAN'S BILLS ARE JUST SIMPLY SAY I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME AND LOOKING. FOR TO MAKE AN AYE VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR VAN SENATOR MITCHELL I WOULD JUST SAY IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION ABOUT AFFORDABILITY YOU KNOW -- WE AS A BODY -- WHEN IT COMES TO K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION DON'T ASK ABOUT HOW WE GOING TO PAY FOR IT YOU JUST GET IT DONE BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE? AND WE FIXATE ON WHAT OUR RANKING IS IN PER PUPIL SPENDING IN CASE. TO FOURTEEN AND EARLY CAN EDUCATION SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT. ARE THEY THE SAME KIDS JUST TWO YEARS LATER. FOR SURE THREE AND EARLY CAN EDUCATION THEN YOU'RE FIVE IN KINDERGARTEN IT'S THE SAME TRIAL TWO YEARS LATER. AND SO WHEN WE DECIDED TO PRIORITY THEN WE WON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THAT -- ANDAND PERHAPS WITH THIS BILL AND CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BEING ABLE TO ORGANIZE AND THEY WILL HAVE THE SAME -- POWER IF YOU WILL -- THAT THOSE WHO -- PROTECT K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WELL I IN THIS IS A A WONDERFUL DAY AND HISTORIC AS I MENTIONED IN AND AND REALLY A BOLD MOVE THAT ITS TIME HAS COME AGAIN. AND WE WILL SEE THE SUCCESS OF IT TODAY I BELIEVE AND AS IT MOVES FORWARD AND AND THE WINNERS AS HAS BEEN. MENTIONED ARE OUR CHILDREN AND WE NEED THAT. WE NEED THAT SUCCESS WE NEED THE BEST. PROVIDERS POSSIBLE AND THIS WILL ENABLE US TO HAVE THAT THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL THRIVE NOT JUST. FOR THIS GENERATION THE NEXT GENERATION WITH THOSE GENERATIONS WILL NEVER KNOW. WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS SO. HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT THEN THE HAPPY TO TO TO MOVE FRWARD WE DO HAVE A MOTION FROM -- SENATOR PAN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER PHYSICAL. XIN IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO TO SHARE COMMITTEE CENTER HILL HI. I'M MORRELL. WORLDNOW JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE PAN. AYE. IT'S FOUR VOTES THE BILL IS OUT VERY GOOD. WELL WE WILL MOVE NOW TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE A. B. FIVE TWENTY NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVALS GOOD MORNING. TO MAKE IT. GOOD MORNING MORNING SO WE ARE AT THE AB FIVE TWENTY NINE PLEASE PROCEED I THINK -- SURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR RIGHT THERE NO SENATORS. AB FIVE TWO NINE PROHIBITS THE PRACTICE OF IMPOSING ON THE SPOT MANAGED. TIME OF ANY PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN ARE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN THE SYSTEM WORKING AT A STATE HOSPITAL. ONYX STAFFING ISSUES AND OUR STATE HOSPITALS HAVE SUBJECTED STAFF TO WORKING MANDATORY OVERTIME. RESULTING IN BACK TO BACK EIGHT OUR SHIPS CREATING HEALTH HAZARDS FOR PATIENTS AND STAFF. WHEN I SERVED AS A SALMON YOU KNOW COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND CHAIRMAN I TOURED PATTON STATE HOSPITAL? I WALKED INTO THE AREA WHERE ALL THE PATIENTS WERE AND WHAT I SAW WAS A SINGLE LINE SEPARATING PATIENTS FROM THOSE THAT ARE WORKING THERE. AND THE EMPLOYEES THERE WAS NO WALL OR OR THE BARRIER THERE WAS THERE. I THINK I MAKE REFERENCE TO MY VISIT TO PATTON STATE HOSPITAL TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO PROVIDE. EMPLOYEE SAFETY AT OUR STATE HOSPITALS. PUTTING A STOP TO FORCED OVERTIME ON A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN NOT ONLY STRENGTHENS EMPLOYEE SAFETY BUT ALSO ENSURES PATIENTS RECEIVE PROPER CARE AND ATTENTION. WITHIN THAT VISIT WE SEEN HOW PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN ASSISTANCE. DEAL ARM IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THOSE INSIDE -- STATE HOSPITALS. WE ALSO SEEN THE SAFETY CONDITIONS THAT ARE THERE. IN THIS ISSUE AS FAR AS MANDATORY OVERTIME I BELIEVE PUTS. EMPLOYEES IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE OF THE AREAS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS. A WEEK LATER A PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN WAS ATTACKED AT PENN STATE HOSPITAL. IS SEVERELY INJURED. THE REASON WHY I BRING UP THE MANDATORY OVERTIME. IS BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SITUATION RATHER THAN DIFFERENT OTHER AREAS IN JOBS IN DIFFERENT PLACES ARE GOING ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HERE WITHIN THE STATE -- HOSPITAL YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE COGNIZANT OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY. AND SO IN THE END THE DAY OF WORKING A FULL EIGHT HOUR SHIFT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO A MANDATORY OVERTIME. BUT THOSE COMPONENTS AROUND THERE I THINK BRINGS VALIDITY TO THE REASON THIS BILL IS MOVING FORWARD AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. AND WITH ME TODAY IS KOBE HAAS ET REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AND SPONSOR OF AB FIVE TWO NINE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MONEY HERE AND CENTERS ITS CITY HALL AND THIS MORNING -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID MY NAME'S KOBE PRESIDING I'M REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. OUR MEMBERS ARE THE LARGEST DIRECT LEVEL OF CARE PROVIDERS -- IN STATE HOSPITALS AND DEVELOP MEMBERS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. AB. FIVE TWENTY NINE PROHIBITS UTILIZING MANDATORY OVERTIME. AS A STAFFING POOL SO SAY YOU WORK YOUR EIGHT HOUR SHIFT YOU. YOU GET UP IN THE A AND GET TO WORK AT SIX FORTY FIVE YOU'RE ABOUT READY STEP OUT THE DOOR AT TWO FORTY FIVE AND YOUR SUPERVISOR TAPS YOU ON THE SHOULDER. AND SAYS I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO WORK IN ANOTHER EIGHT HOUR SHIFT. NOW THINK ABOUT YOUR SINGLE MOM. AND YOU HAVE TWO KIDS AND YOU GOT TO PICK THEM UP FROM SCHOOL AT THREE FIFTEEN YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDCARE ARRANGED YOU DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY TO WATCH THEM. UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN YOU'RE GONNA GET OFF WORK. THIS IS AFFECTED BILLION DENTURE SERVER KEEP BECAUSE IF YOU SAY NO. THE STATE WILL THEN ISSUE AN ADVERSE ACTION. AND THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR CAREER. SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN IN GENERAL BUT AS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID IN TERMS OF SAFETY. 92%. OF THE PATIENTS RESIDING IN THE STATE HOSPITALS ARE THERE AND FRIENDS A COMMITMENTS THAT MEANS THEY'RE EITHER NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY. INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL OR THEY'RE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS THEY JUST HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUDICATED. AS GUILTY YET [inaudible] SO. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THE LAST YEAR THERE WAS TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED ASSAULTS ON STAFF IN THE STATE. SYSTEM. WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS WORKING IN THE SAY HOSPITAL SYSTEM AT FIVE HOSPITALS. SO IT'S REALLY NOT A MATTER IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET ASSAULTED IT'S A MATTER WHEN AND HOW SEVERE. SO. YOU REALLY TRULY DO NEED TO BE ALERT AND ON YOUR TOES AT ALL TIMES -- THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AS ACCURATELY SEATED IN IN THE ANALYSIS DID A STUDY IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATED IN ITS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE SEVEN SHOULD SET A TARGET OF REDUCING. OVERTIME FOR NURSING STAFF WORKING IN THE STATE HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE FOR CITIES. FACILITIES BY 50%. BY TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SHOULD ELIMINATE THE USE OF MANDATORY OVERTIME EXCEPT IN DOCUMENTED AND EMERGENCY -- YEAH FOR FOR US WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STATEMENT FOR THE LITTLE OVER COMMISSION TO MAKE. AS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE WAS ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOURS OF OVERTIME WORKED IN THE STATE HOSPITALS BY PSYCH TAX. OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS INVOLUNTARY MEANING MANDATORY. YEAH I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT I WANTED TO THANK SENATORS. MITCHELL JACKSON PAN AND HILL FOR SUPPORTING IT SB SEVEN EIGHTY WHEN IT CAME BEFORE YOU IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WE HOPE TO HAVE YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDING OTHERS IN SUPPORT. MR EMBERS RAINED SHERMAN WITH RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALTHOUGH THIS LEGISLATION DOES NOT IMPACT OUR MEMBERS CORRECTLY WE BELIEVE -- IT'LL HELP TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY -- SURROUNDING THE FACILITIES AND OUR MEMBERS HAVE GONE THROUGH SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR OVER THE YEARS OF BEING FORCED WORK OVERTIME AND SO WE KNOW HOW. IMAGINE YOU CAN BE TO THE SAFETY OF THE FACILITY AND PUBLIC SO. VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. THE BILL ME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR MITCHELL. I HAVE A QUESTION I CAN YOU KNOW TO TO REQUIRE MANDATORY OVERTIME SUGGESTS TO ME A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AND SO AND SO HOW MANY VACANCIES ARE IN THE POSITION AND WHAT. PLAN. WOULD BE AN ASSET THE LAST MINUTE. TO THE DEGREE THAT WE HAVE TO GET A BILL TO PROTECT THEM FROM THAT THIS SUGGESTS TO ME THAT STAFF IS INADEQUATE SO WHERE ARE WE IN THAT PROCESS. SO CERTAIN FACILITIES HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT THAN OTHERS LIKE ATASCADERO AND COOLING TO HAVE A VERY TOUGH TIME -- THIS IS. STAFFING THEIR FACILITIES HOWEVER THEY'RE NOT THE FACILITY THAT HAS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OVER TIME. PATTON'S AND PATENTS VACANCY RATE IS 4% [inaudible] WHILE ATASCADERO. AN ACTUAL SHOULD SAY THE LARGEST VACANCY RATE IS AT METRO. AT 19%. THAT'S JUST BECAUSE YOU AUTHORIZED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR NEW POSITIONS THERE BY HIS HAND ENABLES. THEY JUST HAVEN'T THEY'VE THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUT STAFF STAFFING IN THE LA AREA IS VERY EASY. STAFFING ON THE CENTRAL COAST IS VERY HARD WHERE IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE -- AND SO FORTH -- AND THEN CENTRAL VALLEY LET BUT IN THOSE AREAS WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO STAFF THEY'RE NOT HAVING THE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH OVER TIME RIGHT SO ARE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH OVERTIME RATES ARE AT NAPA STATE HOSPITAL. AND AT PATTON STATE HOSPITAL WHERE THE VACANCY RATES ARE INCREDIBLY LOW IT'S BASED ON SO THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING THE INCREDIBLY HIGH. I MEAN GRANTED THERE'S THERE'S HIGH OVERTIME EVERYWHERE RIGHT BUT THE MANDATORY OVERTIME IS GENERALLY SEEN AT NAPA. AND THAT'S A MANAGEMENT ISSUE IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF OKAY AND AND AND AND I WOULD LIKE THAT I THINK WHEN YOU. ARE PLANNING EXACTLY AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR FOR AUTHORIZING THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE NEW PSYCH TECH POSITIONS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THAT WILL VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE. THE MANDATORY OVERTIME AND AND SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PRACTICE SHOULD AND TO BECAUSE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. A NURSE CANNOT WORK BEYOND TWELVE HOURS IN A DAY. ABSOLUTELY CANNOT THE STATE WAS EXEMPTED FROM THAT WORK ORDER IN. TWO THOUSAND ONE THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU SENATOR WHICH WE DO HAVE A MOTION OF PENDING FROM SENATOR JACKSON'S.

THE 10% BID PREFERENCE A SCORING CREDIT ON THE STATE DID FOR TRANSIT OPT FOR A TRANSIT OPERATOR. THAT VOLUNTARY AGREES RETAIN THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES THE PREVIOUS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE THE SAME AS ON THE PREVIOUS CONTRACTOR. UNDER CURRENT LAW. LEGISLATION WAS SIGNED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO PROVIDE A 10%. FRIENDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC TRANSIT CONTRACTS PROVIDERS THAT VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO RETAIN THE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES THE PREVIOUS CONTRACTOR. IT'S ABOUT LAW IT WAS TO ADDRESS THE HIGH RATE OF TURNOVER OCCURRING IN THE CONTRACTED OUT SEGMENT A PUBLIC TRANSIT. HOWEVER THAT LEGISLATION TO NOT PROVIDE A BIDDING PREFERENCE FOR BIDDERS ON STATE CONTRACTS AND PUBLIC TRANSIT WHO AGREED TO RETAIN EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THE STATE TRANSIT WORKER WORKERS JOBS RIGHT REST DUE TO CONTRACTING OUT FOR EXAMPLE STATE EMPLOYEES WERE SHUTTLE DRIVERS ARE HEARST CASTLE LOST THEIR JOBS -- CONTRACTOR CAME AND HAD A BIG PROFITS BEEN IN PLACE PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTOR WOULD HAVE OULD HAVE BEEN IN SO I WOULD HAVE HAD AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP THE DRIVERS AND THE DRIVERS WILL LIKELY.

BOTH OF THOSE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THE BILL -- WE SPONSORED THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE VERSION THAT ONLY APPLIED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AND AND THAT BILL AS A SIMILAR KALRA SAID WAS BECAUSE WE HAD THIS TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WHERE THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR JOBS EVERY THREE YEARS BECAUSE A NEW TRANSIT CONTRACTOR WOULD COME IN AND UNDER BID? BASED BASICALLY ON ON EMPLOYEE WAGES. SO THIS TAKES THAT INCENTIVE AWAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S WORKED VERY VERY WELL WE BIRD HEARING NO COMPLAINTS FROM TRANSIT EMPLOYERS -- AND IT IT HAS REALLY PROVIDE STABILITY FOR THE FOR THE WORK FORCE AND SO NOW IT'S TIME TO TO MOVE IT TO THE STATE LEVEL THERE ARE CONTRACTS AT THE STATE LEVEL WHERE THIS.

THANK YOU MISS SURE OF THE UP TO PRESENT AB SIX FORTY SEVEN FORTY TODAY. SB SIX FORTY SEVEN REQUIRE COSMETIC AND DISINFECTED MANUFACTURERS WHO ARE ALREADY REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. TO POSE THE SAFETY DATA SHEETS ONLINE AND TRANSLATE INTO COMMON LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY SOMEONE SPECIALS. SALON PROFESSIONALS MANY OF WHOM ARE IN IMMIGRANTS WOMEN OF COLOR AND HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH SKILLS. ARE EXPOSED THE BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING A MULTITUDE OF CHEMICALS KNOWN OR SUSPECTED OF PRESSING CAUSE HARM. REQUIRING SAVE IT AS A DATA SHEETS BE ACCESSIBLE ONLINE IN TRANSIT INTO LANGUAGES CALMLY SPOKEN BY SOME FASHIONS WILL RAISE AWARENESS TO APPROVE THE HEALTH. AND WORKING CONDITIONS OF THE WORKERS AS WELL AS THE THE CUSTOMERS. AND DISCUSSES THE OPPONENTS OF AGREED PROPOSED TECHNO AMENDMENTS. THIRTY TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WHICH OF AN OUTLINED IN THE NOW SAYS THESE AMENDMENTS REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION. I WOULD BE DELAYED BY SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS CATHERINE PORTER OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE. THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MORNING -- AGAIN I'M CATHERINE PORTER I'M POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE. WORK COALITION WHICH WORKS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH SAFETY AND RIGHTS FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY VIETNAMESE IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE AND NAIL SALONS. WE AND WORK SAFE ON WHOSE BEHALF BY ALSO SPEAK TODAY ARE CO SPONSORS OF A. B.. SIX FOUR SEVEN CALIFORNIA NAIL IN HERE SO LONG WORKERS MANY OF WHOM ARE OF OUR WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. HANDLE A RANGE OF DISINFECTANTS AND COSMETIC PRODUCTS CONTAINING PERSONAGENS AND CHEMICALS LINKED TO REPRODUCTIVE RESPIRATORY AND OTHER HARM. MANY SALON PROFESSIONALS ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. UNDER EXISTING LAW MANUFACTURES MUST DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE HARD COPY SAFETY DATA SHEETS FOR PRODUCTS CONTAINING HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. THEY ARE ALTERNATELY REQUIRED TO BE AVAILABLE AT WORKPLACES. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THESE HARD COPY DOCUMENTS CAN GET LOST IN THE LONG CHAIN OF DISTRIBUTION. SALON OWNERS REPORTS OF THEIR OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE AT BEAUTY SUPPLY STORES. ADVOCATES LIKE OUR ORGANIZATION AND COUNTY AND CITY COORDINATORS OF LOKI LOCAL HEALTH EMAIL SOMEONE RECOGNITION BROWN'S. REPORTED THEY HAVE A HARD TIME OBTAINING SAFETY DATA SHEETS FROM MANUFACTURERS AS THEY TRY TO ASSIST SALONS AND BECOMING HEALTHIER WORKPLACES. EVEN IF AN SDS IS AVAILABLE ONLINE SOMETIMES ONLY SOMEONE WITH A PROFESSIONAL LICENSE CAN ACCESS THEM. THEN ONE SAFETY DATA SHEETS ARE OBTAINED LAKE WHICH IS OFTEN A BERRIER -- BECAUSE THEY CURRENTLY ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO APPEAR IN ENGLISH. SO AB SIX OR SEVEN ONLY REQUIRES TWO THINGS OF MANUFACTURES ONE WHERE BECAUSE MEDICAL DISINFECTANT IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO HAVE A SAFETY DATA SHEET. THAT SAFETY DATA SHEET MUST BE POSTED ONLINE AND TO MAKE SAFETY DATA SHEETS MORE UNDERSTANDABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO USE THEM BY TRANSLATING THEM ONLINE. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A MODEST AND REASONABLE ATTEMPT TO SHINE MORE LIGHT ON THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF COSMETICS AND DISINFECTANTS.

IN OUR LETTER SUPPORT I I MENTIONED THE THOUSANDS OVER THE OVER THE YEARS SINCE. CASTERS WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN CALPERS IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO THOUSANDS OF ARMENIAN AMERICAN RETIREES. FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPANNING BOTH PENSION SYSTEMS. I WANT TO JUST MENTION ONE EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SUCH A WONDERFUL RETIREE EDWARD MINASSIAN OF MORAGA CALIFORNIA. HE TAUGHT.

THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE HOPEFULLY IT WAS NOT AS DIVERSIFIED AND THEY MAY HAVE ISSUES WITH REACHING THAT GOAL AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY.

MY QUESTION IS I I APPRECIATE YOU HAVE A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY -- TO TO THE PENSIONERS BUT I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER -- YOUR BOARD YOUR GOVERNING ENTITY ESTABLISHES ANY KIND OF BOTTOM LINE CRITERIA IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS THAT YOU DEEM INAPPROPRIATE. THE BOARD DOES LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE RESEARCH THEY HAVE AN ESG POLICY AND THEY ALSO THE DIVESTMENT POLICY BUT DIVESTMENT AS ALWAYS LAST RESORT. AND WHAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE ECONOMIC RISK INVOLVED. SO THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE TO FIND AND HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT PROCESS INITIATE. SO CAN BE INITIATED BY THE BOARD SO THEY CAN ASK TO AND BUT THEY ALWAYS START WITH ENGAGEMENTS. AND CHRIS IS UNIQUE SITUATION WITH A FOREIGN COUNTRY. BUT THEY START WITH ENGAGEMENT THEY WORK ON THE ISSUES THAT THEY IDENTIFY THROUGH THE SG PROCESS AND THEY USE PROXY VOTING THEIR SHAREHOLDER POWER IN THOSE SORT OF THINGS AND TRY TO SEE WHERE THEY CAN GET ON THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. AND AGAIN AS A LAST RESORT THERE'S NO ACTION -- CHANGE THAN THEY COULD MOVE TO DIVEST. AND HAS YOUR BOARD -- NISHIDA PROCESS WITH REGARD TO THIS ISSUE [inaudible] NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. YOU. WE WOULD LIKE -- TO I'M SORRY SENATOR MORALE LIKE EUROPE THANK YOU. YEAH I SPOKEN AND SUPPORTED NUMBER THANK YOU HAVE. FOUR I BELIEVE TURKEY SHOULD. ABSOLUTELY ACKNOWLEDGE HAD THE GENOCIDE AND GOT SOME GOOD FRIENDS THERE. ARE FROM TURKEY AND THE HOUSTON OVER THERE EVERY YEAR AND I CAN'T GO ANYMORE BECAUSE THE SEEM TO BE. COMING MORE OF AN OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENT -- SO I CAN I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT'S WHERE MY HEART IS ON THE APP BUT I'M A LITTLE BIT RE IT LOCKED IN ANYTIME -- YOU KNOW WE WE TRY TO YOU KNOW CALPERS AND CAL STAR IS IS A LITTLE BIT BEHIND ON THEIR INVESTMENT SO. THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THE BEST THING FOR YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A DUTY -- TO INVESTOR SO IT'S KIND OF A COMPLICATED THNG BUT ONE OF THINGS I WORRY ABOUT WORK COULD END UP GOING OF WHAT IF WE HAVE STATES THAT -- THE IN A LOUISIANA PRODUCES OIL ON YOU KNOW I'M FOR OIL PRODUCTION OF OIL -- WOULD WE HAVE SOMETHING SOMEDAY THIS AS WELL HER SISTERS CAM -- INVEST IN. OIL IN LOUISIANA SO THOSE ARE KIND OF THINGS AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE I'M GOING TO VOTE ON AT THE RIGHT NOW. IT'S ONE OF THOSE -- TOUGH ONES BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS STOOD WITH YOU OVER THE YEARS SINCE WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER ON YES. BUT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT -- BECAUSE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS IS THERE IS. THERE BEHIND AND THEY NEED TO CATCH UP SO THEY HAVE TO USE -- IS GOOD AS I CAN THEY THEY CAN'T. AND I'M NOT SURE OF TURKEYS AT THAT POINT [inaudible] WHERE -- WE SHOULDN'T DO BUSINESS WITH THEM -- AGAIN THEY SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE GENOCIDE WHICH THEY NEVER HAVE SO ANYWAY I JUST WANT EXPRESS MY OPINION THERE. AND IN. YEAH JUST TO EXPRESS MY OPINION I'M NOT SURE HOW TO VOTE ON AS SOME. STRUGGLING WITH RIGHT NOW. BUT YOUR INSURANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO IN YOUR CLOTHES. ESPECIALLY AMENDMENTS AND HOW THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES STILL MAINTAINED IN THAT. THANK YOU AND DOES SHE KNOW FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- I HOPE I CAN CALL YOUR CONCERNS AND YOU CAN COME TO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL SENATOR. FIRST OF ALL I'VE. AS A CALIFORNIAN FIRST AND FOREMOST I NEVER WANT TO DO ANYTHING. THAT WILL COMPROMISE. ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH THE INTERESTS. UP FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO I WILL NEVER TAKE A MEASURE OF WHICH A MEASURE OF FORWARD. THAT WILL COMPROMISE CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST OR CALIFORNIANS INTEREST. HAVING SAID THAT. THIS IS A EXTREMELY WELL PROTECTED. EVERY AT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY OVER THE FIVE YEARS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL. EVERY COMMITTEE IT'S GONE THROUGH I'VE TAKEN MORE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE. THAT IT WILL NEVER CAUSE DAMAGE. TO THE BOTTOM LINE INTEREST WHICH IS STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR RESIDENTS. IN ORDER FOR THIS BILL. IF IT'S PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. TO ACTUALLY TAKE A FACT. A FEDERAL ACTION WILL HAVE TO BE TAKEN. AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY. WHICH IN ITSELF [inaudible] IS [inaudible] A LOT. PRETTY LARGE TASK. BECAUSE THEY ARE SEEN AS AN ALLY. IN THE REGION. SO FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. THAT'S A BIT OF A STRETCH ALREADY. EVEN SHOULD THAT HAPPEN. THE LANGUAGE IS VERY SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT KIND OF ACTION. AND THE ACTION IS GOING TO BE ALONG THE LINES OF IF. HE DOES NOT. RECOGNIZE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE SAID IT'S NOT JUST ANY FEDERAL ACTION. PRESCRIPTIVE TO SPECIFIC ISSUE. IF IF THOSE TWO ITEMS. ARE OVERCOME AT THAT POINT. CALPERS AND CAL STAR STILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT GO AHEAD AND IMPLEMENT. BECAUSE OF FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY. SO I KNOW THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO BREAK GO AGAINST THE GOVERNOR NOR. NOR THE LEGISLATURE FOR AN ACT THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. TO RESERVE THAT RIGHT. SO GIVEN ALL THE DIFFERENT GUARD RAILS. SECURING THE INTEREST OF CALIFORNIANS -- THIS IS MORE OF A MESSAGE A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE. THAT A HUNDRED AND FIVE YEARS LATER HUNDRED AND FOUR YEARS LATER PLUS. CALIFORNIAHAS NOT FORGOTTEN. ASIDE FROM PASSING THE ANNUAL RESOLUTION THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS PLUS. THAT WE ARE GOING TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. IN ENSURING WHAT IN HUMAN HOW WE ADDRESS AS A SOCIETY AS A CIVILIZATION AS A STATE. MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN. NOW IF THE WORLD HAD COME TO A CONCLUSION IF THE WORLD COMMUNITY I'VE TAKEN STEPS TO HOLD TURKEY ACCOUNTABLE. WE MAY HAVE NOT SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TURKEY TODAY. BECAUSE THE WEST DID INVEST IN TURKEY AFTER WORLD WAR. ONE THE POINT WHERE IT HAS BECOME A TOP TWENTY FIVE GDP WORLD CONTENDER. AND IS SPIRALING DOWN NOW. BECAUSE THE CURRENT REGIME IS TRYING TO GO BACK RATHER THAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REFORMS. ACCOUNTABILITY IS OF GOOD. COMPETITION IS A GOOD THING WE ALL ESPOUSE THESE IDEAS. THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN DOING EXACTLY THAT AT A MORE LEVEL. THIS WILL THIS BILL WILL NOT BE IMPLEMENTED. I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'LL EVER BE IMPLEMENTED BUT IT WILL. ALWAYS BE IN THE BOOKS IF IT PASSES AND IT'S SIGN. AS A SIGN THAT WE ARE WATCHING OVER. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE VOTING FOR SO I DO HOPE BY ON YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. IT WAS A VERY NICE CLOTHES I APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR MITCHELL. THIS IS. BECAUSE AS AMENDED. TO JUDICIARY. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR HILL AYE HILL AYE [inaudible] I JACKSON [inaudible] MITCHELL AYE. THE BILL HAS THREE VOTES WILL HOLD WILL OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER CARILLO YOUR WELCOME [inaudible] YOU HAVE. THREE BILLS. ON OUR AGENDA. AND IF IT WORKS WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE ITEM NUMBER TEN A. B. SIX SEVENTY THREE IS THAT -- PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE COMFORTABLE [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. THIS THING ON IT IS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL. SIX SEVENTY THREE MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES. WHO ARE NOT PAY THEIR WAGES ON TIME? I TOOK THE AMENDMENTS TO RESTORE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S ABILITY TO PURSUE A BIRD OF BUREAU OF LABOR ENFORCEMENT OR BOTH THE INVESTIGATION ON A AND A THIRTY THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. HAS IN CURRENT LAW. RECEIVING YOUR PAYCHECK ON TIME IS A BASIC GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT AND AS A MATTER OF DIGNITY AND WORKER RIGHT. HOWEVER WORKERS ESPECIALLY IN LOWWAGE INDUSTRIES WAIT DAYS WEEKS EVEN MONTHS SOMETIMES TO RECEIVE THEIR PAYCHECKS. THIS YEAR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ISSUE THE LARGEST CITATION IN THE STATE. FINDING A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NEARLY TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REPEATED WAGE THAT VIOLATIONS WHICH LEFT OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WAITING WEEKS. AND EVEN MONTHS FOR THEIR PAYCHECKS. UNDER CURRENT LAW EMPLOYEES HAVE NO DIRECT RECOURSE WHEN THEY ARE NOT PAID ON TIME. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S ABLE TO RECOVER A PENALTY WHEN WAGES ARE NOT PAID ON TIME BUT ACCORDING TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER THIS PENALTY HAS NOT BEEN COLLECTED. EVEN IF THE PENALTIES WERE TO BE COLLECTED BY THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. THE PENALTIES GO TO THE STATE NOT THE WORKER. UNDER AB SIX SEVENTY THREE THE PENALTY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING WILL BE PAID TO THE AFFECTED EMPLOYEE. MOST IMPORTANTLY. THIS BILL WILL HELP STRAIN THE MOST BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. OF SIMPLY GETTING YOUR PAYCHECK ON TIME. WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE BEING HOMELESS. WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY. HAVE A PAYCHECK TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT ON THEIR MORTGAGE ON TIME. WITH ME HERE TO TEST OF IT -- TESTIFIED TODAY IS THE NOW THAT WOULD BOND WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORK RIGHTS AND KATIE FEISS TERRACE STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK. THANK YOU BILL.% THE MOTION FROM SENATOR MITCHELL WE WILL ENTERTAIN SHORTLY. THANK YOU FREE. FOR SIX MORNING MR I CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DANIELLE URBAN I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR WORKERS RIGHT. SACRAMENTO BASED LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS. WE ARE PROUD CO SPONSOR AB SIX SEVENTY THREE BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE IS NO PRACTICAL REMEDY FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT PAID ON TIME. FOR MANY EMPLOYEES TO LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK LATE PAYMENT OF WAGES CAUSES EXTREME FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. AND RIFF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR FOOD RENT AND THESE. LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TEN CURRENTLY ONLY ALLOWS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO RECOVER THE LATE PENALTY IN AN ACTION BROUGHT. EVEN IF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WAS EXERCISING ITS AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION TWO TEN WHICH IT IS NOT. THE PENALTIES ARE PAID TO THE STATE AND NO RECOVERY IS PROVIDED TO THE WORKER. I CURRENT RECOVERY UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWO TEN THROUGH LITIGATION IS NOT REALISTIC FOR MOST EMPLOYEES WHO SIMPLY WANT TO BE ISSUED THEIR PAYCHECK AND SOME COMPENSATION FOR THE LOSSES CAUSED BY THE LATE PAYMENTS. AB SIX SEVENTY THREE WILL ALLOW INDIVIDUAL WORKERS TO RECOVER THE PENALTY ALREADY PROVIDED IN SECTION TWO LABOR CODE SECTION. TWO TEN THEIR LABOR COMMISSIONER WAGE CLAIM PROCESS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE BERMAN HEARING PROCESS. WE AT THIS A HUNDRED THE WORKERS EACH YEARS WITH THEIR BERMAN HEARING CLAIMS AN THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO RECOMMEND THAT THEY ADD PENALTIES WHEN THEY AREN'T PAID ON TIME. CURRENTLY THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADD ANY PENALTIES WHEN NOT PAID ON TIME. THIS BILL ALSO WOULD ALLOW THE LABOR COMMISSION TO CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE PENALTIES THROUGH ITS EXISTING PROVISIONS INCLUDING THROUGH THE BOTH THE MECHANISM. THE CHANGES TO LABOR CODE TO TEN ASK PROPOSED IN AB SIX SEVENTY THREE CREATES A DETERRENT FOR EMPLOYERS. TO ISSUE PAYCHECKS LATE IN THE HOPE THAT NO EMPLOYEE HAS TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF LATE PAYMENT. AND WE URGE TODAY AND I VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF CLIPPERS PLEASE PROCEED GOVERNMENT IN AND A HALF SELECT A GOOD ACTORS GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHERINE VYSTAR I'M AN ATTORNEY AT LEGALLY THAT WORK. IN THE WAGE PROTECTION PROGRAM WE HOLD SEMI MONTHLY LABOR COMMITTEE -- WAGE CLAIM CLINICS AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WE SEE THIS ISSUE ALL THE TIME AND TIME IN AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN OR FORCE TO TELL OUR CLIENTS. THAT THE RECORDS FOR THEM RIGHT NOW IS AS BLEAK I WANTED TO SHARE JUST TWO QUOTES FROM A A TWO OF OUR CLIENTS. WHO HAVE -- WHO ARE PAID LATE TIME AND TIME AGAIN -- BANDS SIMPLY ASKING TO SEE MY PAYCHECK IS ENORMOUS AND UNPAID. IT IS DEMORALIZING TO HAVE TO ASK FOR MONEY THAT I HAVE WORKED HARD TO EARN.

ANOTHER CLIENT I LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND ON MY WAY JUST TO SUPPORT MY FIVE YEAR OLD SON AND WIFE. I RELY ON MY WAY JUST TO PAY OUR RENT BUY FOOD AND PAY OUR BILLS IT'S FRUSTRATING NOT KNOWING. WHEN I'M GOING TO BE PAID I WORRY ABOUT HOW I WILL PAY FOR MY FAMILY'S MONTHLY EXPENSES?

THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WILL PROTECT THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIAN FINISHER ELEVATOR. AND ESCALATORS ARE CONSTRUCTED UP TO THE CAL OSHA STANDARDS. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT NO ELEVATOR OR ESCALATOR BE OPERATED WITHOUT A VALID AND CURRENT PERMIT ISSUED BY THE ELEVATOR UNIT WITHIN CAL OSHA. HOWEVER CERTAIN ELEVATOR COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN INCORPORATED INCORPORATING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CONVEYANCES AND HAVE KNOWINGLY INSTALLED ELEVATORS THAT FAIL TO COMPLY WITH CAL OSHA BUILDING STANDARDS. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THESE PROJECTS THE COMPANY THEN SEEK TO REMEDY THROUGH A VARIANCE APPLICATION THROUGH FROM CAL OSHA. AS A RESULT THERE ARE GREAT PRESSURES. ON PUBLIC AGENCIES SUCH AS SCHOOLS OR UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE THEN FACED WITH REMOVING AN ELEVATOR COSTING SEVERAL MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARE FILING FOR AN EXEMPTION AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT PROVIDES THAT A PERMIT TO BUILD OR WORK ON A CONVEYANCE MUST BE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED IF THE WORK PERFORMANCE THE TERM AND TO VIOLATE. BUILDING CODE OR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY STANDARDS THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES THE PERMIT HOLDER WITH A NOTICE OF PERMITS SUSPENSION AND GIVES THE HOLDER AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CONTEST THE SUSPENSION. AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS MISTER MIKE MONICA NUMBER HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL UNION.

JUST A FEW FLOORS IN OUR BUILDING AND SOMETIMES WE GET STUCK IN OUR OWN ELEVATORS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE AND SOME OF THIS ACTUALLY COMES TO LIFE AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR GOOD THANK YOU AND I THINK THE PROBLEM THAT I I HERE IN OUR DISTRICT IS THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH ELEVATOR INSPECTORS. TO DO AN ADEQUATE JOB OF KEEPING THE INDUSTRY GOING. FOR SURE THAT'S CORRECT SOUNDS LIKE YOU COULD BE A BUDGET. CHALLENGE AND GET MORE FUNDING FOR CAL OSHA. WE HAVE THE BUDGET CHAIR HEREBY WHO WORK ON THE YOU HAVE A SOLUTION DEVELOPER PROCREATION I'M SENATOR MITCHELL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CENTER HILL AYE. AYE MORRELL [inaudible] JACKSON. MITCHELL. MITCHELL. TO VIRTUAL THE ROLL OVER ON THAT FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AS WELL NOW MOVING TO ITEM NUMBER NINETEEN AB. FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I AM ON A ROLL TODAY. YOUR THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND A MEMBER. AB PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THE METHOD VIOLENCE SURVIVORS HAVE HAVE THE DESERVE OPTION OF A STRAIGHT FORWARD AND EXPEDITIOUSLY A PATHWAY TO JUSTICE IN THE CASE OF THEIR EMPLOYERS WRONGDOING. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS NEEDED BECAUSE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS TO SERVE A CLEAR AND DIRECT LEGAL AVENUE TO BE DRESSERS COMBINATION AND RETALIATION. BY THEIR EMPLOYER BASED ON THEIR STATUS AS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND STALKING MUST% PROVIDE JOB PROTECTION TIME OFF TO SEEK MEDICAL LEGAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE WORKPLACE. UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THESE RIGHTS ARE VIOLATED SURVIVORS ARE OFTEN LEFT WITHOUT LITTLE OR TWO NO RECOURSE. TODAY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO EXPERIENCE MISCONDUCT AT THE HANDS OF THEIR EMPLOYER ARE ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. HER PURSUE THE CLAIM UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PAGA. THESE EXISTING OPTIONS ARE OFTEN INEFFECTIVE REMEDIES THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS. TO PROCESS AS A RESULT IN THE SURVIVOR RECEIVING A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE CIVIL PENALTIES RECOVERED. FOR LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT 30% OF SURVIVORS REPORT REPORT EITHER HAVING BEEN FIRED. I OR FEARING TERMINATION BECAUSE OF THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS AND 34% REPORT HAVING TO QUIT A JOB. BECAUSE OF THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. THIS BILL WILL PROMOTE ECONOMIC STABILITY FOR SURVIVORS BY EMPOWERING THEM TO OBTAIN LEGAL REPRESENTATION THINK JUSTICE THROUGH. ASSISTANCE IN NEGOTIATING THE RETURN TO WORK OR THE RECOVERY OF THEIR LOST WAGES. YOUR TO ATTEST TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IS LARRY DOYLE WITH THE CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS AND JULIA PERISH WITH THE LEGAL AID AT WORK. THANK YOU [inaudible] THE MORNING [inaudible] MITCHELL. ON BEHALF OF THE THE CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS -- THIS IS A WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT -- JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED IN THIS CASE. YOU HAVE AS CLEAR SITUATION OF THAT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH VICTIMS IN THESE -- CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES -- DO HAVE. POSSIBLE REMEDIES REMEDIES ARE EITHER INEFFECTIVE OR INTO MANY CASES ARE -- IS A NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG OF COMPLAINTS UNDER THE RELEVANT SECTIONS. YET TO BE DECIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. YEAH AN DIDN'T. WE NEED TO HAVE -- QUICKER MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF VACANCY OKAY GETTING THEIR REMEDIES SO WHILE WE'VE AS FOR THIS AND WE HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORTER QUESTION. THANK YOU. MORNING MORNING -- MY NAME IS JULIE A PARISH AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK. OUR SURVIVE PROGRAM EXISTS SPECIFICALLY TO HELP ENHANCE THE FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE OF SURVIVORS AND OF VIOLENCE. SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE IS. CRITICAL TO MAINTAINING SAFETY AND FOR SURVIVORS AND WE HEAR FROM HUNDREDS OF SURVIVORS A YEAR WHO FACED THE EXACT PROBLEMS THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO SPOKE TO THEY GET FIRED THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS AND WHEN THEY CALL UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GREAT OPTIONS THAT I HAVE TO OFFER THEM. AND WHEN WE ALLOW CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE OR NATIONAL ORIGIN OR DISABILITY. THE ABILITY TO FILE A LAWSUIT BUT WE DENY SURVIVORS THAT ABILITY WERE REALLY REINFORCING THE MESSAGE THAT THEY ARE SOMEHOW LESS WORTHY AND THAT THEIR RIGHTS. ARE NOT WORTH THE SAME PROTECTION THAT OTHER PEOPLE'S BASIC FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ARE. AND AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AT GIVE SURVIVORS WHO ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE AND TO THESE SORTS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THEY THEY NEED THAT FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE SO MUCH. EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE THERE RIGHT. AND THEN AS AND MY FELLOW AND SUPPORTERS POINTED OUT SPECIFICALLY THAT LABOR CODE SECTIONS TWO THIRTY INTO THIRTY POINT. ONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE ARE ONLY THIRTY NINE CLAIMS FILED AT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER FOR VIOLATIONS F THOSE LAWS. AND AT THIS POINT ONLY THREE OF THOSE ISSUES NOT EVEN THREE OF THE ENTIRE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SETTLED THE REST OF THEM ARE. STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AND THAT IS SIMPLY TOO SLOW. SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS. ARCHER SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS HERE IN SUPPORT MORNING. CHRISTINE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIPS AND MYSTIC VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MORNING CAN L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G ON BEHALF OF&lt;/c&gt; THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAITLIN BEG FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN SUPPORT. RENEE BAYARDO ESSAY YOU CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE'S IN SUPPORT. MORNING IN THE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS THAT HAVE BECOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. UNFORTUNATELY OUR OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE CERTAINLY DON'T CONDONE DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION AGAINST -- SURVIVORS OR VICTIMS WE HAVE PARTICULARCONCERNS WITH THIS BILL IN THE CREATION OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO ENFORCE THESE CLAIMS. WANTED TO POINT OUT THE BILL THAT CREATED THE LEAVE PROTECTIONS FOR THESE CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYEES SENATOR JACKSON'S BILL SB. FOUR HUNDRED FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ORIGINALLY CONTAINED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT BEFORE THE BILL SENT TO THE GOVERNOR THAT PRIVATE READ RUSSIAN WAS DELETED FROM THE BILL. SO WE THEREFORE DON'T SEE NEW A NEED TO CREATE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION HERE. WE HAVE SOME CONCERN WITH THE PARTICULAR LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THE BILL SAYS AN EMPLOYEE MAY ALSO FILED A CIVIL ACTION IN ADDITION TO AND LABOR COMMISSIONER CLAIM IN A POCKET CLAIM. AND WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS OF THAT COULD RESULT IN THREE SIMULTANEOUS -- PROCEEDINGS FOR THE SAME VIOLATION. JUST A QUICK NOTE ON THE LABOR COMMISSION -- RETALIATION PROCESS -- THERE'S THERE'S SOME STATISTICS IN THE ANALYSIS WE'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THE REPORT I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE PICTURE THAT THOSE -- SISTER. SIX PAINT. FIRST OF ALL TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX CASES WERE FILED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN FOR RETALIATION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX OR ELEVEN A TWO POINT. FIVE ONLY FIFTY SEVEN OF THE ALLEGATIONS OUT OF FOUR THOUSAND ALLEGATIONS OR POINT 001% FELL UNDER LABOR CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY INTO -- THIRTY ONE SECOND WHILE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX RETALIATION CASES WERE OPEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN DEAL SEE CLOSE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN CASES. AND FINALLY DEAL SEES REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THERE ARE ONLY FOUR CASES REMAINING UNASSIGNED AT THE END OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO CASES. THAT NOT YET BEEN ASSIGNED AT THE END OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS TO THE RETALIATION PROCESS CENTER HERTZBERG HAD LEGISLATION SB THREE OF SIX FROM. SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO IMPROVE THE THERE'S A CLEAN UP LEGISLATION OF THAT THERE'S BEEN BUG ME. BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS. TO THE RETALIATION UNIT SO. IT'S NOT A PERFECT PROCESS BUT WE THINK THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS AND THAT IT IS AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS. WHEN FINALLY WEEK WE JUST DON'T THINK A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS NECESSARILY A PANACEA IN ALL CASES -- AND THIS IS A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL -- FROM LAST MONTH THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION'S LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY SUBMITTED TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SENATOR MITCHELL MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR THE PARKING UNIT WHICH NOT REVIEWS BARGAIN NOTICES AND REVIEWS SETTLEMENT CLAIMS AND AND THEY SAID IN THAT. BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL QUOTE. HUNDRED FORTY SIX SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS REVIEWED BY THE PAGI PAGI UNIT AND FISCAL YEARS. TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RECEIVED A GRADE OF FAIL OR MARGINAL PASS REFLECTING THE FAILURE OF MANY PRIVATE PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS TO FULLY PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF THE AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE. THE THOSE ARE MY WORDS ARE THE WORDS OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THOSE WORDS OF THE NEW SAID ADMINISTRATION'S LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE DON'T THINK A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS NECESSARILY THE BEST SOLUTION IN ALL CASES THAT WERE POST THANK YOU. OTHERS HERE IN OPPOSITION. DON'T GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION LIKE TO ALLOW MY COMING OUT OF CHAMBERS. SEAN WAS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS CONCERN LITIGATION ISSUES AS DESCRIBED ALSO OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS. NONE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU. SO I'LL ASK THE QUESTION WHY IS THIS BILL NECESSARY AND I'LL RESPOND BY SAYING -- CURRENTLY A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR CAN FILE RETALIATION OR DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE OR PURSUE A PRIVATE RIGHT. A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACT PAGA THAT ALLOWS AN INDIVIDUAL TO PURSUE OTHER REPRESENTATION REPRESENTATIVE ACTION ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES OF TIMER LEMME. AGGRIEVED EMPLOYEES AGAINST AN EMPLOYER IN ORDER TO GET A PAGA CLAIM STARTED THE WORKER MUST FILE A CLAIM WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. WHICH IS A SEPARATE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY. AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND SORRY IN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND IS GIVEN SIXTY DAYS TO DECIDE WHETHER TO PURSUE AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND WITH PAGA IS THAT THIS IS A WAY TO RECOVER PENALTIES ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. SO IT DOES NOT REALLY WORK FOR CLAIMS UNDER TWO THIRTY OR TWO THIRTY POINT. ONE PAGA IS USED FOR CLAIMS LIKE UNPAID WAGES OR MISSED MEALS OR REST BREAKS WHERE THERE ARE DISTINCT VIOLATIONS OVER VARIOUS PAY PERIOD AND PENALTIES. I CAN ATTACH FOR EACH VIOLATION. A RIGHT A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION PROVIDES THE EMPLOYEES WITH CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN CASE AND ALLOWS FOR THEM TO FALL DIRECTLY WITH THE CIVIL COURT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS OR BE LIMITED TO PART OF PENALTIES. THIS IS AT THE END OF THE DAY OF BILL THAT PROTECTS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS THIS IS THE VALUES OF OF OUR STATE. AND IT ALLOWS THE SURVIVOR TO CHOOSE WHEN AND HOW THEIR COMPLAINT. IS HEARD AND HOW THEY CHOOSE TO PROCEED. THIS IS WHY WE ARE PUTTING THIS BILL FORWARD AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST [inaudible] VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL WE HAVE A MOTION TO TO PASS TO JUDICIARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SENATOR HILL HI HILL AYE MORRELL. WELL NO JACKSON. I I CAN. THE BILL HAS TO GO TO HOLD THE ROLE OF THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD BILLS TODAY. I SAW ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE.

TWELVE NINETY ONE GOOD MORNING RIGHT. IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU TODAY. LEAVE US TO CONFIRM GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWELVE NINETY ONE CLARIFIES THE TIME FRAME WOULD CANNABIS BUSINESSES NEED TO COMPLY WOULD LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS. A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND THE LABOR ORGANIZATION THAT PRESCRIBED APPLICATION A BEACH PARTY. THESE AGREEMENTS TEND TO INCLUDE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PROVISIONS THAT PROTECT BUSINESSES. AND AND EMPLOYEES AS PARTY APPLICATION PROCESS TO OBTAIN A CANNABIS LICENSE THIS IS THIS WITH AT LEAST TWENTY EMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO STATE THAT THEY WILL ENTER A LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT IF THE BUSINESS THAT. HAS NOT ALREADY INJURED ONE HOWEVER CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE SILENT ON WHEN BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES NEED TO ENTER THE LABOR PEACE AGREEMENT IF THEY BECOME EMPLOYERS OFTWENTY OR MORE.

ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE PROBLEM SURE YOU ALL ARE A GLAD THIS IS THE LAST -- GOOD MORNING I THINK IT IS YEAH IT IS -- GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO YOU AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA -- THE PROJECT CALIFORNIA CALLED A CENTERS JOB ACT. OF CALL CENTERS ARE MAJOR ECONOMIC FORCE IN THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTING ABOUT 3% OF ALL OF OUR WORK FORCE. YET THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT CENTER JOBS HAVE DECLINED IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND A LARGELY DUE TO OUTSOURCING AND LAYOFFS. IT HAS BECOME ALL TOO COMMON FOR CORPORATIONS TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF STATE FUNDING AND SUBSIDIES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING JOBS OVERSEAS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS CORPORATIONS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE SUBSIDIES WERE FUNNELING CALL CENTER JOBS OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THE SHUTDOWN OF JUST FIVE OF JUST FIVE CALL CENTERS FROM ONE COMPANY RESULTED IN NEARLY. A THOUSAND MIDDLE CLASS JOBS LOST. CORPORATION SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR OUTSOURCING AND TO CONTINUE SUBSIDIZING CORPORATIONS THAT EXPORT CALL CENTER JOBS ONLY SERVES TO INCENTIVIZE THIS BEHAVIOR. CASA JOB SHOULD BE BASED IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYERS SEEKING TO RELOCATE CALL CENTERS JOBS FROM CALIFORNIA TO ANOTHER COUNTRY GIVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS NOTICE. IN ADDITION EMPLOYERS WHO EXPORT CALL CENTER JOBS OVERSEAS WOULD BE PROHIBITED. FROM RECEIVING ANY STATE GRANTS GUARANTEED LOANS OR TAX CREDITS FOR FIVE YEARS. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE COULD CURRENT COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA AND SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION CAN I SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL IS LIST SORENSON THE POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR CW A DISTRICT [inaudible] NINE WELCOME. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND ALSO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS LIZ SORENSON I'M THE POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT. NINE AND OF COURSE I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN SEVEN SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. SO CALL CENTERS ARE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC LIFELINE FOR MANY COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH TWO HUNDRED IN APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND WORKERS WITH THE JOB TITLE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. BUT THOUSANDS OF CALL CENTER WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN RECENT YEARS AS MAJOR CORPORATIONS HAVE OFF SHORED SERVICE OPERATIONS OVERSEAS. SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN FOR EXAMPLE A. T. AND T. HAS CLOSE CALL CENTERS IN ANAHEIM BAKERSFIELD ATWATER SACRAMENTO OAKLAND. AND ATG IS ALSO SEVERELY REDUCED ITS WORK FORCE IN SAN RAMON FRESNO SAN DIEGO COMMERCE PASADENA ESCONDIDO AND TORRANCE IN MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN SPECTRUM FORMALLY KNOWN AS TIME WARNER CABLE CLOSE ITS CALL CENTERS. IN PALM DESERT WITHOUT WARNING LAYING OFF TWO HUNDRED WORKERS. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN RISE IN WIRELESS CLOSED IT'S CALL CENTERS IN OUR IRVINE AND EMPLOYED OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COMPANY CLOSED ITS CALL CENTER IN RANCHO CORDOVA ALSO LAYING OFF OVER THOUSAND WORKERS THIS TREND HAS HARMED WORKING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS AMERICA. WHILE ENDANGERING CONSUMER SECURITY BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE CALL CENTERS IN COSTA RICA OR HOME TO A MASSIVE TELEMARKETING SCAMS THAT DEFRAUDED THOUSANDS US CITIZENS MOST OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE OF UPWARDS OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. WITH NEW TAX PROVISION IN THE TRUMP TAX BILL COMPANIES ARE EVEN MORE LIKELY TO MOVE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WORK OVERSEAS ACCORDING TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION THE NEW TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM EXAMS. OFFSHORE INCOME FROM US TAXATION COSTING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. FOR CORPORATIONS TO MOVE JOBS OFFSHORE TO COUNTRIES WITH LOWER TAX RATE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROVISION AFTER THE FEDERAL TAX BILL PASSED. EIGHTEEN TEASE COMPANY THAT NETTED TWENTY BILLION FROM THE TAX SAVINGS HAS ELIMINATED OVER TEN THOUSAND CALL CENTERS IN THE U. S.. WITH THE LEGISLATORS IN NEW YORK IN ALABAMA RECENTLY PASSING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. TO PROTECT CALL CENTER WORKERS IT IS TIME THAT WE ALSO PUT CALIFORNIA WORKERS FIRST. THAT WE HAD NEW LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE OFF SHORING PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE NOT REWARDING COMPANIES WHO ARE ACTIVELY ELIMINATING GOOD JOBS IN OUR STATE. AB SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE JOB STATE IN CALIFORNIA IN THAT IT PROTECTS CONSUMERS. ALL IT DOES IS PROVIDE NOTICE IF A COMPANY OFFSHORE 30% OF ITS CALL CENTER. WORK AND LIMITS ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE GRANTS GUARANTEED LOANS AND INCENTIVES FOR FIVE YEARS IF A COMPANY OFF SHORES 30% OR MORE OF ITS CALL CENTER. AND AT THE END WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIA TAX CREDITS GO TO COMPANIES THAT OFFSHORE THEIR JOBS. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHIRLEY WEBER. FOR HER LEADERSHIP AS IMPORTANTLY IN OF COURSE FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FOR COMMUNICATION WORKERS AMERICAN OF COURSE I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT A. B. SIXTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING AGAIN GOOD MORNING MR CHEN MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS TO ME THAT THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM ARE HAVING TO SUBSIDIZE THEIR COMPANY MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS. CW WAY HAS HELPED TO CREATE THE MIDDLE CLASS IN THE STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY THROUGH GOOD UNION JOBS AT EIGHTEEN T. AND AT THIS. WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THE CUT THE COMPANY AS THEY ELIMINATE THESE JOBS. THE STABILITY AND THAT THESE FAMILIES THAT THESE WORKERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE.

YOUR SUPPORT. THAT WAS MY SENSE. I DON'T KNOW JUST CAME TO ME THAT WAY. DARCY SHE AND CW A NINETY FOUR TWENTY ONE IT'S THANK YOU. ADD TO WISH A FOR CW A NINETY FOUR TWENTY ONE AND I'M IN SUPPORT VERY GOOD WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MERRY RACE CW A NINETY FOUR TWENTY ONE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. HAVING COME OUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- AND WE RESPECTFULLY ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I THINK WE HAVE SOME FUNDAMENTAL PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WE WANT. TO CONVINCE BUSINESSES THE SAME CALIFORNIA WE THINK WOULD BE MORE PRODUCTIVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. POTENTIALLY REDUCING SOME OF THE REGULATORY BURDEN ON A BUSINESSES. WE WANT TO KEEP THEM HERE RATHER THAN A PUNITIVE APPROACH. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL'S IMPACT ON ATTRACTING FUTURE CALL CENTER JOBS THE CALIFORNIA AND THESE CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR A COMPANY TO CONSIDER. CREATING A NEW CALL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA IF THEY THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT WHEN THEY SEE THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS IF IN THE FUTURE THEY MAKE A DECISION TO LEAVE SO WE THINK IT'S GONNA IMPACT JOBS IN THAT LEVEL. SO DESPITE OUR FUNDAMENTAL OPPOSITION WE TRY TO ENGAGE OFFERS ALL AUTHORS OFFICE AND CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT AMENDMENTS AND DOCTORS OFFICES BEEN. VERY GRACIOUS IN A MEETING WITH US AND WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THE AUTHOR HAS. TAKEN US FAR WE HAVE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL CONCERNS. WE THINK THE NOTICE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL SHOULD BE LIMITED TO SIXTY DAYS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE WARN ACT WHICH IS A SIXTY DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT. THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS OF THE TAX CREDIT PROVISION. DOES NOT HAVE A NEXUS TO TAX CREDITS CENTER FOR JOB CREATION OR OPERATIONS OF THE CALL CENTER AND SO YOU COULD HAVE A LARGE COMPANY THAT HAS -- ONE CALL CENTER FOR ONE DIVISION -- AND THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT TAX CREDITS AT A COMPLETELY SEPARATE PART OF THE COMPANY RECEIVES. TAX CREDITS THAT MAY BE USED TO CREATE OTHER JOBS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE A TIGHTENING UP OF THAT PERHAPS THE NEXUS -- FOR THE TAX CREDIT PROVISION. THE REMAINDER OF THE BILL DEALS WITH THE CONTRACT AND WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THOSE PROVISIONS AS WELL. FOR US IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS BILL RELATES TO A EXISTING PORTION OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE THAT WAS ENACTED BY A WE NEED A BILL BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PUBLIC CONTRACT COULD SECTION. TWELVE ONE FORTY THE BILL DEALT WITH CERTAIN STATE PROGRAMS CALL CENTERS THAT SERVER CERTAIN STATE PROGRAMS LIKE HOW WORKS AND CAL FRESH. THAT SECTION OF THE LAW EXCLUDES CERTAIN PROGRAMS FROM THAT FROM THAT A PROVISION OF THE LAW. IT ALSO SAYS THAT THOSE LIMITATIONS DON'T APPLY IF THEY WOULD VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW ARE VIOLATE SOME TYPE OF FEDERAL TRADE AGREEMENT. IT'S UNCLEAR FROM US WHETHER THIS BILL SUPERSEDES THOSE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW. SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE TWO PROVISIONS. RELATE. FINALLY. SEVERAL EXISTING STATE CONTRACTS ALREADY DEAL WITH OVERFLOW SITUATIONS CALL VOLUME -- BUT YOU PROBABLY ALL REMEMBER THE SITUATION WE HAD IN THERE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY WHERE EMPLOYEES WERE CALLING EDT ABOUT THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND COULD NOT GET ANYBODY ON THE PHONE. WAS A LARGE PROBLEM SO SOME OF THE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN STATE. AGENCY SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH CALL VOLUME. AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RINGS IF THE CALL IS NOT ANSWERED IN CALIFORNIA HAS. KICKED OVER TO ANOTHER STATE SO AT LEAST A CONSTITUENT GETS. PERSON ON THE PHONE. AND SO THE REASON AMENDMENTS -- DEALING WITH OVERFLOW ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT MATCHES UP WITH THE CONTRACT PROVISIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN NEGOTIATED THAT DEAL WITH OVERFLOW MY UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT AGAIN SOME OF THESE CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC LIMITS OF THE PHONE RINGS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TIMES. AND ISN'T ABLE TO BE ANSWERED IN CALIFORNIA KICKS TO ANOTHER STATE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL DEALING WITH OVERFLOW. IT HAS TO BE A 30% INCREASE IN CALL VOLUME -- AND THEN THEY CAN GO TO OVERFLOW BUT ONLY FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND WE THINK THE EXISTING. CONTRACT PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED DEAL WITH. CALL VOLUME AND AND WHEN CALLS ARE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER STATE SHOULD CONTROL. THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THE OVER FLOW AMENDMENTS DO NOT LINE UP WITH THOSE EXISTING CONTRACT REMEDIES SO. FOR THESE REASONS AGAIN WE HAVE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS -- WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN COMMERCE AND WILL CONTINUE TALKING ABOUT -- CONSTRUCTIVE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REDUCE THE CONCERNED. WE ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. I CHRISTINA'S BAGNOLI CAL BANKERS OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THE CALL RISE CALIFORNIA MAY PRISON TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO WEEK -- WANTED TO ADD TO WHAT THE CHAMBER WAS SAYING REGARDING CONCERNS WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS THAT IN MANY CASES WE HAVE MANUFACTURERS WHO LIEU PROJECTS -- THROUGHOUT THE THE WORLD AND WHILE THEY MIGHT BE MOVING A CALL CENTER THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PROJECT MIGHT NESS IS NOT NECESSARILY BE A PERMANENT. RELOCATION WHICH IS A TEMPORARY LOCATION RELATED TO THAT PROJECT AND WE NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT AND WE'RE NOT CONVINCED THAT THE BILL COVERS THAT AND NOW THAT SITUATION ALLOWS FOR THAT. KIND OF ACTIVITY AS IT RELATES TO A PROJECT THAT MIGHT ALSO HAVE A FEDERAL -- YOU KNOW CONNECTION SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFTEN TRY TO WORK THAT OUT BUT AND FORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL POSTING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE HERE IN OPPOSITION. NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE CONVERSATIONS. WOULD YOU LIKE T RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITION I KNOW YOU. HAD SOME YEAH SURE THE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. YOU'RE HAVING THOSE PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM AND TRYING. TO SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED IN AND I KNOW IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO JUDICIARY WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH THEM AND SEE IF THERE'S AGAIN LIST SORENSON WITH CW A DISTRICT. NINE I'M I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE SIXTY DAYS THAT THEY BROUGHT UP -- I I WILL TELL YOU THAT AGAIN THIS BILL IS ABOUT JOBS IT'S ABOUT WORKERS AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE SIXTY DAYS. YOU KNOW RECENTLY I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WE JUST HAD HERE IN THIS STATE ONE OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT WE REPRESENT WHICH IS EIGHTEEN T. THERE WAS. THREE HUNDRED AND I BELIEVE SIXTY EIGHT EMPLOYEES THAT WERE LAID OFF ESSENTIALLY SOMEWHERE PLACE SO WE ENDED UP WITH LIKE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIS WAS JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. THE WARN ACT DID NOT APPLY IN THE REASON THAT IT DID NOT APPLY BECAUSE HE'S OUR TECHNICIANS THAT ARE SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE STATE IN GARAGES. SO IT DIDN'T MEET A QUOTA THAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. IT RIGHT IN ONE LOCATION THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT BUT I WILL TELL YOU. WHEN YOU ARE THE PERSON AND WE ARE BECAUSE WE REPRESENT THESE WORKERS AND WE HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO LOSE THEIR JOBS? AND THEY HAD LITERALLY THE EMPLOYER I THINK GIVEN LIKE SEVEN WEEKS I DON'T EVEN THINK IT WAS THAT LONG. WHEN YOU HAVE TO TELL SOMEBODY YOU ARE NOW TO FIND A NEW JOB IT WAS DEVASTATING SOME OF THE STORIES OUT THERE? CHAU. PERSONALLY I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY WOULD QUESTION A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GIVE THESE EMPLOYEES AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE. TO GO ON SOME OF THESE FOLKS HAD JUST YOU KNOW ONE FAMILY MEMBER WORKING THAT MEN NO INCOME COMING IN SO AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN GIVE THESE EMPLOYEES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE IS NOTIFIED SOMETHING AS DEVASTATING. AS LOSING THEIR JOBS ARE GOING TO DO THAT AND WE BELIEVE THAT SIXTY DAYS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THOSE REASONS WE REALLY SUPPORT THE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS I HOPE YOU ALL DO TO THANK YOU. YEAH AND I AND I WILL SAY THAT IN ALABAMA AND IN NEW YORK THE BILL THAT PASSED THE DID PASSED WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. THANK YOU. HI MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE ACOSTA HERNANDEZ ALSO BEHALF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE I'M ON THE ISSUE OF THE THE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE AS FAR AS CALL CENTERS -- THAT PARTICULAR A PROVISION OF THE AUTHORS OFFICE HAS BEEN MEETING WITH A NUMBER. DO THE WORK NOW -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA M. AND WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF OVERFLOW AND AND OTHER AND TRANSFERS ANOTHER SHE'S LIKE THAT. SO THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE NOW IS REALLY A BY PRODUCT THOSE DISCUSSIONS. AND SO A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED TODAY'S THE FIRST THAT WE'VE HEARD THIS FOR SOME CONCERNS AS FAR AS BEING IN PARTICULAR CODE SECTION -- THAT'S FOR THAT WE'VE HEARD EVIDENCE THAT I'M AWARE OF IT HAPPY LOOK AT THAT BUT AS FAR AS WORK ABILITY IS. IT'S BEEN RAISED TO US WHAT IF I A CALL CENTERS TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE -- WHAT IF THERE'S NEGOTIATED OVERFLOW SITUATION SO ALL OF THE MEMBERS THAT WE'VE TAKEN TODAY ARE BASED OUT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS OR HAPPY TO WE THOUGHT WE ADDRESS THOSE THAT THERE ARE NO? OTHER ENTITIES ARE NOT HERE TODAY THAT WE THINK THAT WE ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND THEY'RE DOING THE WORK RIGHT NOW THE CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THEY SEEM TO BE -- IT'S NOT A 100% PRETTY CLOSE TO BEING OKAY WITH THAT MA'AM SO PUT FORTH TO ALWAYS HAPPY LOOK AT IT. EVEN FURTHER BUT WE THINK THAT WE'VE ALREADY GONE PRETTY FAR. THANK YOU. FOR THAT APPRECIATE THIS TERMINATION WANNA MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT TO ON THE STATE CONTRACT STUFF YOU JUST HEARD MANY OF OUR FOLKS AT ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE THE COUNT YET. THAT THEY WORK WITH AND THAT SPECIFIC SPECIFIC ON CALL CENTER. AND A LOT OF A MENTION THAT THEIR JOBS ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING THE STATE. I I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ABOUT THAT HERE WE HAVE AN ENTITY THAT HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT YET THE VERY WORKERS THAT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT THERE SOMETHING. WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE RIGHT AGAINST WE'RE LOOKING AT TAXPAYERS MONEY IN CONTRACTS THAT WORK IF THEY'RE CONTRACTING THESE CALL CENTERS THOSE JOB SHOULD STAY RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WELL CALIFORNIA'S. WHAT ARE ALSO IN OUR WORK?
