This hearing is now convene. For those of you who don't know me and assembly member on and I'm lucky to have him. At thank you for attending this informational hearing of for the select committee on career technical education and building a twenty first century workforce many of you have been to our hearings before. I also want to think assemblymember Luis Rivas for coming today and she sits on labor and employment committee she also sits with me on revenue and tax -- And I wanna thank you for being here with us today. I'm working from during my time in the assembly to champion career technical education and workforce development because the roles of these issues play in California in securing. Living wage not living wage job it's but careers. I look forward to continuing that work with assembly member Reavis -- But what as we all know no matter what community workforce is vital. Today we we will explore public policy is to California report which highlights the potential. By twenty five of who will need. HM but this it's about the story. For those of you who know who anyone who's ever heard me speak before recently California made a significant investment into C. T. and workforce development assembly bill sixteen oh to a budget trailer bill established a strong workforce development program. Allocating two hundred million dollars for that program this pastor the legislature approved assembly bill eighteen oh eight which provided a further a hundred and fifty million dollars for career technical education programs. This funding is much needed support for career technical education but is not the only factor. California must better match it supply of labor with demand. Information chair at sharing in do driven investments are critical in this endeavor and we must examine how we at the state can facilitate this partnership. That a comprehensive and collaborative effort across industry educational institutions and workforce development organizations California risk creating a polarized economy of has and has not. Such a realisation serves no one and we must ensure all Californians have the necessary skills to secure employment that provide economic security for their families -- An apparent form a foundation for robust economy and of course we really aren't we need to focus on expanding our middle class. I will now turn over to assembly member lose Reavis for her opening remarks thank you again for being here. Thank you assembly with -- When they Burke and thank you for everybody that's here today -- Very excited to be here -- This is the topic that I really care about and I'm. I'm proud to be here to join -- Assembly member Burke -- In her work -- I'd also like to thank the city of Lawndale and the Lawndale community center for hosting us today -- So I represent the thirty ninth assembly district which is in the north the San Fernando Valley. It includes -- Several communities like a claim -- Send Bally on the city of San Fernando is in my district -- I grew up in this district and when I was a kid -- The north the San Fernando Valley had a lot of manufacturing and aerospace jobs so we had a price Pfister plant -- Down the street from my elementary school that made faucets that were union jobs -- High skilled workers we had Lockheed -- And other men aerospace industry -- And most people were able In home you know a base you know small basic home but and I think since we lost a lot those jobs and a lot of the companies left that area -- That community hasn't recovered -- And that this is one of the reasons I'm very interested -- In the topic. You know today most of my district is considered a disadvantaged community -- Other issues that we have -- That come along with that -- There's this week the LA times is doing a series. On child poverty in my district and focused on an elementary school that I attended -- So something I'm very passionate about is -- Homeless children -- But a lot of the reason some of these families are homeless is because there aren't high skilled jobs -- That P. good weight is anymore in that community -- You know I believe that you know city is vital not only to help in our state's economy. But also to help uplift communities like mine. By and you know as a former educator myself you know I'm the founder of a nonprofit -- That teaches stem education to girls and hands on stand with computer science wood working you know this lot lots of highs highly skilled -- You're preparing them for high school careers -- You know my background I studied electrical engineering I also worked in manufacturing -- Right out of college and a lot of the people that I worked with -- At the company were didn't have a college education but they were trained on a specific skill. And were paid a living wage -- And so I'd love that for Los Angeles our economy our Ste our whole state economy. To have that again to you know what can we do what are the needs and that's why I'm interested in learning from you. On what are the needs out there how can we better coordinate -- What can we do estate legislators -- To bring these jobs to our communities. So again I'd like to thank assembly member Burke city of Lawndale the panelists. And I look forward to learning from you today [inaudible] Thanks. Thank you assembly member reviews and also assembly member Gipson will dip in at some point will let him have his opening remarks when he gets here but before we begin we those who want to participate in and public comment there's a sign in sheet in the back. I think it's at the back table for those of you who want to sign in -- We have additional changes to the agenda Ernesto Medrano will be filling in for run Miller from LA O. C. building trades council. And Dr Virginia Rappe will be speaking on behalf of El Camino college in place of Adrin Estrada. We will now begin with our first panel. The kitchens [inaudible] For first [inaudible] So are [inaudible] One of okay okay. So. For our first panel to start we have Serra bond director of research and senior fellow of the public public policy institute of California. Thank you so much and thank you assembly member Burke for convening this hearing and for including PP I see for those in the audience who aren't familiar with PP I see we are that public policy institute of California. A non partisan independent research institute devoted to studying policy issues critical to California and work forces at the top of our list so I'm really pleased to be here today. Recently PP I see surveyed Californians on issues of higher education and the workforce and we found that 75% of Californians believe our public higher education system is vital. To of the quality of life here and economic vitality of California and not only that they also 75%. And I think that this should be a high or very high priority for the next. The the new governor so this is a really timely conversation right after the election. So thank you for convening this -- Imprint. The majority of future jobs in California will require at least some college training about a third about his degree or higher in about a third community college training. And this -- Shift is the result of you know long term trends in our economy towards a knowledge based economy. That effects not just what you jobs are created in California and the skill requirements there but also the skill requirements in jobs that are already on line in our economy. In addition two empty so in in addition to improving kind of job availability I'm having a college degree or some college training also increase it incredibly improve access to better paying careers for Californians. This chart which I'm sorry it might be hard for some of you to see -- Shows the top ten job wrote that is projected of through. Twenty twenty six and what you see is another result of the long term trends toward the knowledge based economy that. Has increased the gap in earnings -- Ford between jobs that have require a college credential and those that do not. So among these top ten you see a handful of careers in mainly service sectors -- That pay less than thirty five thousand dollars a year jobs like personal care aides. Food preparation labor -- And material movers -- These jobs do not require. A college education. At the other extreme you see a handful of positions like software developers registered nurse thing -- Operations managers market researchers -- Earning three to four times as much as those lower skilled positions -- And of course these are jobs and careers that require college education and this trend shows no sign of abating. In fact it could become more extreme with changes in a high and robotics and other -- Item on the nation -- That is likely to to do what we're likely to see in our economy with a large public higher education system is quite a challenge -- In being responsive to what the work force and requires for the future and also being responsive to student needs because the future of labor force in California. Is comprised of workers that are much more diverse than the current labor force -- And from groups that have typically historically -- And she to lower levels of education beyond high school. California has made I would just say a lot of progress and and improving access and college attainment for these groups but there's still room to improve. And I think -- Community colleges are critical to meeting that need because they really are the point of entry for most Californians pursuing education beyond high school -- And they serve about three times as many students as the state that the CSU and you see systems combined. If you just look at career technical programs this gives you a bit of a snapshot of the students that are pursuing education in that round. It's a very diverse group of students in terms of their ethnic background they tend to be low income the majority anyway -- And there's a diverse range of students -- Pursuing CT training and and the California community college system on the average age of the student is thirty so we're not is that these programs actually serve a wide range of backgrounds from recent high school graduates to stranded workers to older workers in need of retraining. And the train as we know -- For a wide variety of important careers in industry sectors. And CT to me is really -- The workforce needs as you as you mentioned in your opening comments because it is so it is really the fastest way. To get that training that helps students improve their economic outcomes and helps our state meet its workforce means -- I would just add that and there's now a wealth of research evidence on the economic pay off to see TV credentials this charges shows the wage return for students to achieve CT credentials -- In the California system and it you know the the kind of pay off that they earn -- In the labor market depends on the length of the credential the highest from a an associate's degree -- And abating a little bit -- For shorter term certificates that can be earned say less than a year but none the less the economic returns are still positive. But the program choice also matters a lot if you if you take health programs out of this calculation you can see that the the economic return to students is much lower. So the choice of the program for students almost as important in a lot of ways as whether take to pursue college training at all. And I would commend the to the chancellor's office in the California community college system for making this salary information publicly available on their website. Tools like the salary server it's really helpful for students to think about what at what this training might get them in terms of labor market opportunities it's also of course really important for policy makers. Who are -- Looking to assess the effectiveness of investments in CT. But when I look at those numbers -- Programs against each other in terms of their just kind of before after return on investment. Because of what really we need to think about are improving long term economic outcomes and mobility for students and and workers in California and there's actually many pathways. That can take students to better career outcomes. In our research at PP I see we've looked at how students staff credentials so a lot of students actually start -- By earning a short term certificate that can be and in less than a year that was the lowest wage return that you saw on the previous charts. A lot of students start their but some of those who -- Stack a credential on top of that eventually catch up -- To students who start with the higher values a associates degree the that's the good news the the challenges that not a lot of students actually do that and not a lot of programs seem to be set up to intentionally help students move along a clear pathway. But that's an active area that the colleges are working on I wanted -- To conclude with this chart that shows that there are. Many pathways that can take students from -- You know kind of a low through CT training and looking we looked at just that -- Students and health programs students you started by earning a high value certificate or speaks give me a high value -- Degree lack an associate's degree in nursing. We see their wages increase of rapidly and substantially by about three times after learning that degree students to start with the lower value credential like a short term certificate if they continue on that career pathway. That bottom line eventually catches up to the students who started on a different pathway so I just wanted to reinforce this point there are many. Ways students can I'm. Konami billeting program. Sign them do that. Really active way -- Prove upward mobility in California and just in closing -- I would reiterate that -- These state investments in CT clearly have benefits for students but that benefit is contingent on our programs being geared towards meeting workforce needs of the future so the partnership with business is really critical -- In ensuring that state investments and students investments of time -- Really pay off in terms of expanding economic outcomes Thank you much. You mentioned -- The that there are several pathways rate that students take. On are those recommended by the community college or did you just find that the students just kind of made their way through. These pathways. It out on their own. That's a great question so what we've done is to try to look across the system and what pathways are offered and there's really a wide range across colleges even in the same similar kind of industry or occupational area you see lots of different structures for how students. Might make it through a program and this is an active area where colleges are trying to create better pathways through the guided pathways movement in strong work for the best. So I would say that you know will probably likely to see and how. Who is our does? You know that there are some really stand out clearly lay out a career progression for students and what courses they need to take what credentials they'll earn. And in other cases it's kind of looks like a choose your own adventure and you see that reflected in what students actually do so we looked at what students have done over the last ten fifteen years. And the combinations of prevents that they are in our you know the kind of across. Quite a range of what they combine -- Both in terms of kind of looking like it's related to upward mobility are up I'd upward career progression or not -- And so I think there's a lot of room for improvement there we found that students who programs I should say -- That are a really ext with a career progression -- Improve student outcomes to a very large extent -- I think the exact percentage was about you know they improve the students odds of completing a second degree by about 16% which is really large in this round -- So there's a lot of promise there to improve. And the script pathway programs Thank you. And when you look at when you look at the opportunity of putting public and private putting the community colleges together with some of the industry's or actually specific companies where do you see the possibility -- For collaboration -- That we haven't taken advantage of so much yet. That's a great question which I actually would like to know the answer to but don't I I'm hoping that some of the other panels might address that as well. And you know we we see what we want to you looks kind of to get the state wide picture of what's offered. And your range of apprentices apprenticeship programs in credential -- Geared toward certain industries -- But we didn't look we we work on the ground enough to know exactly kind of the potential for them for what. Great thank you that was I mean yanking pages out of your presentation keep for later when I quote them hopefully and committee sometime. Thank you for being here thank you [inaudible] That. All right well now have our second panel come forward. Justin a carrying Christos and doctor almost laws are jandal internet [inaudible] The five and Mister Dawson if you'll start [inaudible] Right. Yes okay well first of all you -- For inviting us to this event is a great event of the time is perfect for chevron. And a lot of passion here -- But just for introduction first also then whichever for eighteen years -- Started a shovel in the year two thousand in operations the exact type of workforce that. Cash around trying to develop our needs for so having this year right now is a to have some conversation about it and how we can board -- What about the first lights See. Took a little bit about our Democrat press seven enough again does -- Just briefly before I really dive into where our needs are with operations training program. And where we see our needs are for the future -- Just briefly a total compensation -- For all of our employees in two thousand sixteen was measured at a hundred and eighty eight million -- Average hourly wages -- For full time operations a main supply. Route forty dollars per hour. And that's it does not including you know average of 17% of annual overtime payment contractor wages we typically bring in roughly around -- Four to five hundred routine contractors per year. Averaging around the forty to forty five dollars per hour -- Of rate. And and a snapshot of what I diversity -- Of us -- Plate looks like over seven US agenda -- Gender male to female ratio 85% generation -- Played. Three to twelve millennials born in eighty eight the Chen x.'ers fortunate -- Thirty nine in the baby boomer generation. And then you see where Reyes plays -- We're races at as far as adversity 51% white. 10% -- Asian 27% Hispanic and a percent -- African American. Someone non visible diversity statistics -- Pretty darn it leads us. Spaces for education is concerned 27%. Of our workforce are actually high school graduates -- out with a degree or some sort of occasional degree war where We're pretty pretty equally space there. Our persist reading program -- SO four seven also gonna operations remember pretty open application process. All of our training is done internally. It's all done in house -- Where we will like to target however is from P. tech institutions that are in our surrounding area? And when I see the timing is perfect because right now we're on a actual learning journey to understand exactly what's. Happening in our surrounding communities. What committee colleges actually offer P. tech programs what their programs look like -- How successful are there -- What's your student demographics of like -- We had a great opportunity to visit a couple of different purposes over the last month so. That that that the timing is right right now area and also -- Coastline community college which is actually an Orange County. What we would like to do going forward is to understand what additional campuses in the nearby areas? That you know reflect the our surrounding communities that we can also leverage your P. tech programs offer for bring it into more skillful workforce to shop and also get the our application process is pretty linking. You know us about six months -- That's from the time from applying for jobs. To actually stepping foot into the door right so it's a pretty lengthy process we have a two month orientation including a two month -- As I to what orientation which includes basic operator training and then you have a two month. You know jobs fifty specific training program so if you look at it. All together is about a ten month term of process is pretty pretty lengthy. What we're gonna do really is looking a little more efficient with a Cup time? How can we leverage what P. tech from offering so that we're doing so much and have? And we're not [inaudible] Work [inaudible] For you know. We don't know too much about what the totals offering from community colleges so that's the reason why we're on a learning to any right now -- Our needs are truly based off you know able to target. A more skilled -- Workforce by leveraging what Peter programs could offer us want to reduce the timeline. That it that it takes to bring somebody actually into. The workforce and being -- You know -- A productive employee and also at the same time decrease employee turnover by targeting those who actually want to be in the P. tech industry P. tech meeting. Process together process technology. Also we're seeing is as far as in is a shift in -- I guess for lack of better words generations right. A large portion of our workforce right now or senior employees and as they you know retire on out with it you know normal attrition. We have a big gap between those employees and the newer employees that were bringing in. So our customer demand is getting a little bit stronger although the numbers are. Growing substantially you're staying around the same. Twenty to thirty annually. But as we're losing our senior staff that that ranging between of skilled workforce or experience in our workforce is dropping significant. So. That's a big reason why we need to bring in a workforce that more skilled coming in so that they can. Become more productive quicker -- For future. You know for several we want to increase the visibility evaluation of P. tech program so hopefully you know with -- Increasing the conversations with us and groups like this and most of all the with the South Bay with we can continue to do that -- Partner with committee because to help develop a bigger talent pool and maybe even. Play a role in how they're programs actually developed and how the programs can be successful. And then just continue to partner with those workers is to keep them never bring going for so. Seven my last question. I was so late to the and to ask a question. Well I do have a quick question because it also everyone can answer this question so fast you know the rest of you you all can answer Sir -- Still I am we are trying to figure out actually actively trying to figure out how to create that connection between the community colleges and private industry and so my question to you would be as someone in that process. What would make it easier for you to make that connection between call just to make sure that they are actually preparing? Folks for your industry. What what would actually make it easier to make that transition to working with the community colleges from my perspective but they will make it easier? If we had a better conduit. Between us and knowing exactly what's out there -- Right now even though I visited three different campuses of the last couple of months. It was -- Was colleges a taken to side right type labor group really didn't know exactly who was out there what campuses are out there. Won't even by the ones that we knew of had just by word of mouth but if we had a actual stable proper conduct. That can tell the tape you know so we just college -- Camino college -- Ellie Harper college right -- That we can draw from. And they're successful that'll be a big game changer for us. Thank you [inaudible] That. But then I would one piggy back on that I absolutely agree I think having. A better conduit and intermediary that can help facilitate those business education partnerships -- I think regional business organizations are starting to play a critical role in this -- In this regard I often joke that -- And I'm trying legal I speak business education and workforce Senate and acquired skill set. And sometimes the educators on the ground are so intent and their primary focus that being able to do that code switching where they can directly interface with employers or really understand their names -- Is sometimes daunting and difficult as well as trying to more deeply a line the systems in in a way in which I mean they and they funds we're ready to engage that means. Today tomorrow within the next week or systems don't always aren't always as nimble and ready to respond -- To the degree that are employers are ready to engage to somehow if we can incentivize those types of behavior which I think. We've done a superb job in over. Several of pieces of legislation last couple years I've tried to elicit these types a B. average per systems I think would be much further along [inaudible] Contract but thank you work in progress [inaudible] That's where. Justin I do want to go -- Is like a centers of it's are next panelist is Justina the Cooley Cooper okay I'm recruiting director for manufacturing a production at face at as well K.. Yes my name. I and the recruiting manager asking sacks for manufacturing production for all our product lines -- Today I'd like to discuss Thank you. At sixty six in general was founded in two thousand its you by can one mosque -- Currently as we stand today were about six thousand employees we have about twelve billion dollars in business contracts and we've had sixty five successful flights so that's a really exciting time for us as we are growing. For such a young organization compared to our members -- Currently we have a few vehicles that were launching right now so we have our falcon. Nine falcon heavy cargo driving and soon to be pre dragon and that will be for manned flight. Falcon nine has been successfully launched sixty two again it's been an incredible feat for us just because it was a historic moment in two thousand and twelve when we were the first commercial spacecraft to make it to the international space station delivering cargo and then also bringing cargo back. Home safely back to earth so that has been a huge piece in terms of our success. Lately -- The next vehicle that we're building right out as you seen falcon having made its premiere this year. And it's the world's most powerful operational launch vehicle. Equals approximately eighteen seven forty seven aircraft. Incredibly powerful and that would be to deliver larger payloads to orbits. For the next couple that were having -- Is for dragon so for cargo tracking we have for flight proven mission. Except -- And that it -- NASA recently announced this year that we wine [inaudible] Black. Now the asset to the international space station in our were dragon spacecraft. At the first. One is gonna be inch would June twenty nineteen to the I. S. S. and that's gonna be !n ma'am. From there and then the next will be for June twenty nineteen for a demo to mission and that will be managed with this. Asheron's and their since the beginning of two thousand and seventeen physics as represented over 60% of all U. S. orbital watches with thirty six completed mission. So far in twenty eighteen SpaceX's achieve the fastest launching its in its history launching more than our domestic or international competitors. Have lunch with eighteen likes so far -- This year which is huge and we have about twenty to plan for this year so we have a couple more coming out. To date SpaceX's this actually landed Thirty exciting [inaudible] From there. Sorry because project working on next is starship. Chau starship is this next generation launch system is fully reusable. And is designed to provide cost effective and reliable launch services for our customers and to serve as an interplanetary transport system. The first opportunity lunch cargo mission to Mars is. Twenty twenty two followed by the first crude mission in. Twenty twenty four currently less than 5% of SpaceX's resources are currently being spent on starship but that will change quite significantly with the years to come. We're looking for top talent in those with a passion for mission SpaceX looks for people who love text. To speech challenge the status quo and solve problems. Like to see strong academics but what's equally important to this is also. Individuals getting involved in participation groups and clubs allow you develop a process product goal. We want people who worked to solve problems and who enjoy experimenting with different solutions within the team based setting. Strong and that makes our part because you will be making very technical decisions at SpaceX so what you learn in school will apply to you in the juggling multiple projects. So bounce academics and hands on experience is a key for us. The work that we do is very challenging however it's incredibly rewarding because we are contributing to something much larger than ourselves. The LA area offers many opportunities for a diverse workforce a recruiting teams look all over the country for the best and we have hard many lovely. For trade school specifically where we are succeeding are with the instructors that have invested their time with us so we have hiring managers that. Partner with them to help create a curriculum space access -- For the work that we do. We have donated expired materials to those schools and have hired me right after graduation what we seem from those individuals they are definitely thriving in our environment. Also see much success with individuals with air frame and power plant licenses however one of the main issues is that can make can be quite expensive obtaining that license. Generally a two year program. Can cost anywhere from From and as a a accredited program. If there was any way to reduce the costs we would have a much larger candidate pool. It's helpful for the state's invest in the training and education programs in the community trust the region's develop more town locally. Los Angeles is a great place first attracted retain talent we're proud to have our headquarters located in Hawthorne. And we're looking forward to more for the future. Thank you. Thank you I'm willing to give -- Assembly member gets and a chance to do of our acts that I have questions about that your trade school environment. Of slim say hi. First of all thank you very much to our that your woman into the committee a sorry for my absence or for my tardiness rather. But this is an important topic for me specially looking at two thousand nineteen working -- To really -- Have a real in depth robust conversation as it relates to correct technical education which is very very important -- And looking for to out of his today's means a thank you good is the chair. Thanks for being here assembly member Gipson up so I do can you tell us a little bit more about the jobs that are coming out of your partnership with the trade schools. To some of the positions we've hired for our propulsion technicians -- Structures technicians composites technicians and with composites it's definitely a very specialized skills that in terms of the material that we use so that's why we decided to donate those to the schools. That has worked out incredibly well for them to be hands on our her managers actually show up on site and work with the instructors from there to create this program so -- For the efforts that we've done locally it's worked out incredibly well for us in terms of potentially creating an apprenticeship program for example. But for the individuals that have worked their income straight out they've done extremely well and I'm I'm in. And how did you make that decision to do that. To partner with the trade schools. We saw so many it in our work force in general at space that they actually do come out from a lot of the trade schools because they have an local to the area so. Just hearing from word of mouth of what programs are becoming or what courses they've taken I just definitely peaked in interest in to us to go check that out. Thank you. For anyone any questions. Yeah my questions also related how you got started. With those partnership -- You just said it was word of now what yeah I mean. Just sure is there anyone that could have helped. Create that partnership like we had said like that. I would probably. You know is that whether someone that helped or did you just do the outreach center average ourselves so sometimes you know. We hear things were very curious and as recruiters are very curious in terms of what else is out there -- It was a great opportunity for us literally just given the calls this call a call -- And then feeding that into the were able to pass this out to the appropriate. Instructors at their schools for us a bill that partnership. So -- They it's been great so far everybody's been very welcoming and writes us coming over there and we've also bring them over on sites you. Take a tour and see firsthand what we deal just because we built over. it's quite exciting in terms of the life that we live. In the factory [inaudible] Thank you. Any other questions [inaudible] Then. Thank you very much thanks for being here and I have the best companies in my district with that -- Knowing her from doctor cells are. Good afternoon everyone in delighted a join you here today and thank you assembly member Burke and assembly member I request for hosting at this competing. I'm I I have the privilege today of representing the California workforce development board of the first let me tell you a little bit about myself my name is almost hours arm a senior vice president at the LA area chamber of commerce and we river represents sixteen hundred member companies -- In the greater LA basin -- In I want to share with you a little bit about what the state board has done -- In both through policy into investments to really help foment stronger connections between our educational institution a workforce development board's and our providers -- To our employers particularly those who -- Hi hi. Hi way tie skill demands -- In our region -- So several years ago when we embarked in the development of our state wide strategic plan it was really with the notion. Around how can we better strength in interesting mental efforts between our workforce development board's in our community colleges an arcade. A K. twelve adults system. And work that then can help provide guideposts for regional economies in a regional efforts -- As a result of that work. There really has -- Created that de um. At the plan to ensure that increasingly our systems are better connecting or better online mean. Are -- Building economies of scale and minimizing duplication and maximizing effort -- Manager Dan will speak to this a little bit in terms of their regional planning efforts are currently under way in ensuring that are seven workforce development board's here in LA county. Are -- Better aligned and more strategic in terms of how their interfacing with regional employers much of which came out of of the state wide strategic plan -- But I think what it really -- Lends itself to it's just the the continued focus around if you're really going to address issues as it relates to individuals who -- Have multiple barriers to employment we really need to ensure that all of our systems. All of our partners are growing in the same -- To is who we want to deeply engage with -- When a point to at least -- For different initiatives that have been funded through -- One of three of which is funded through the governor's -- Discretionary funding and one of which which was just codified a couple of years ago and where there is currently -- Appropriations going to be provided to ensure that we continue -- To focused around this work -- So the first being the sling shot initiative -- Which seeks to collaborative efforts between employers industry government workforce economic development. On educational partners within the region to identify and solve employment challenges -- In the last -- Fiscal year the state invested six point one million dollars in the sling shot initiatives -- Which I know came to the LA region a particularly focused on health care and we've done others throughout the state -- That have really done this work and I think what it really points to and what the resources of been for it to really invite and a pool for innovation within our region -- And give our our workforce development board's and others the creativity to start to address these issues and to really go beyond silos -- To ensure that we are eliciting for some of the best practices -- So kudos to the state board and others who really brought a visionary mindset to this and have really in many ways. I'm use these resources to incentivize -- These innovative behaviors -- The second is a workforce accelerator find -- And similarly -- As governor discretionary funding. Provided six million dollars in two and twenty eighteen decks that design develop and implement and accelerate -- Employment and reemployment strategies of for our our hardest to serve job seekers -- And similarly test for types of innovations and solutions that try to address -- These barriers to employment -- And then lastly -- Investments in the high road training partnerships -- In these have been focused around there been -- Eight demonstration projects that have I'm in this is -- Uniquely focused around -- The delivery of equity sustainability and job quality for again -- Some of are harder to serve populations and ensuring that. We are -- Incentivizing. These are implementing the strong. That have really range of from transportation to health care projects and another efforts -- So again I am twenty two three discrete of funding streams that have really sought to engage employers resources that are available that in many ways invites employers to be not only the table but help try these innovative partnerships. Again working across our respect silos -- To ensure that we're getting a higher yield these types of investments and really be an incubator for our some success successful -- Initiatives -- Lastly all point to AB -- Eleven eleven this was led by the California workforce assist California workforce association NWA -- Was codified more than resources for A. B. eleven of and and it's a fifteen million dollar grant program. That will -- Encouraged and community based on his agents to work with its workforce development board's. In -- Identifying of resources for individuals with barriers to employment and where we can better serve -- These populations -- There are a series of stakeholder meetings that will be scheduled this. I'm with the expectation that the request for proposals will be made available -- Next spring so just something to keep an eye on in terms of as this legislation is forward in Nazareth been resources appropriated what can we glean -- From these initiatives that can that we should then be working. Terms of helping to bring the scale -- Create a critical mass of opportunities for individuals that we need to serve. I will also add particularly as it relates -- To workforce accelerator and sling shot -- There has been a pushed around how to weave badly we these initiatives in trying to glean take away. Not necessarily assess how well they work but what it what is it that we can take from this particular initiative that then we could look towards as pillars of effective practices that we might want invest. So A. Posner happening cost. I have a change of the okay a question I have a question so okay so the money will so. I have a couple questions one what did the engagement look like so I hear the there was money allocated to these programs one question would be why did the engagement with employers look like and what was the outcome and what was. The sort of again passage and okay. And there was one of the funded projects in okay to it with a great app. So that's made one of that's my question is what to the engagement look like how they were employer how are employers found on the city of chevron here that want to participate in some of these things. Well the the the the one that -- Was referred to was the health care coordination grant what happened together and we did you tell us what you need. We're gonna tell you what you need you tell us what you mean what came out was que is coordination. So -- That started a long string of discussions and coordination and how to do that. And we found a couple colleges. That were able -- To this space specifically trained for the curriculum that the employers wide. And we contracted with those -- Hospitals we had lots of help from the hospital association. Who survey there -- Members and based on that. We've filled up the class and we have a waiting list for people that want to go into that so it took awhile to get. To to get it all going but that's how come that's how it started. We said what do you want they told us we contracted with the hospital association. We set them down with all their and their nurse practitioners to tell us what to the curriculum look like. Develop the curriculum. And identified those colleges that were able to teach. And I remember when you do that that was last year you started. Last year we were in mounting it last or anything -- And then my next question is for those who want -- To be part of these programs for the students. Whatever age that student may be -- What kind of -- Assistance have we what kind of funds and we provided to assist them in being able to actually take the program to go so often transportation is an issue or having to take off work isn't issues so have we provided on any sort of state level three workforce development board's. Up something to alleviate some of the strains. So for that particular program it's a little different because that particular program there was a limited number of slots and we feel that and many of those people are already working. In lower jobs so right so there is is basically incumbent workers that were able -- To to they already had transportation. But in our regular programs the regular corps might be that we get from the state federal government through the state is we have support services available to put people in those programs using our base allocation. Allocation so there's no separate allocation and just to give an order of magnitude in terms of at least the workforce accelerator find and it has been in place. For several years now. The state is invested about forty million -- Grant initiative -- But they've awarded a hundred and twenty five grand. And certain about fourteen thousand participants statewide -- I think that you know. The point being that I think there's an opportunity to double serve for individuals and obviously -- The order magnitude is greater than the resources that are currently being invested -- But I think what this points to is where I think in many ways the state board is -- Hello. I'm dina be innovative in terms of how it it's making its investment than trying to offer the best practices in hopes that. Not only do. Lessons but also ways in which we might work. His efforts scale. And then my last post for it and and you guys feel free. To wondering do you data on any of our because some of these programs have it listed do you have any date on on their six Sir. Are the their this. Suddenly conducting an elevation of these initiatives I believe that's under way but now that. It's been analyze just yet but I'm only in the near future -- You mentioned [inaudible] That you. The example that you gave with the health. Hospital assistant and how you got together. To develop correct. Graham -- Is that are those programs at to be specific to the a run to the read. Or are then they able to be taken to another part of the state as an example a like a already kids that's ready. To go. Aye aye. I think it it is a package is ready to go but what we were looking at primarily was the only sin -- An Orange County only basins as far the demand for those particular jobs what they are across the state I don't remember. But certainly the package in the information is available to distribute and to replicate. So if there were a demand in another part of the state arms. To certain they don't have to start over rate no no no no they should start over okay. And actually -- And I'm sure Dân knows that this particular initiative as actually put out -- Eighty in evaluation of its own work and has a full report in terms of what they learned from. The degree to get access to that. Because as we look a think what you know some of the goal I know like it's some of my goal is to really figure out how. To make that process easier how to find out where the gaps are regionally these tend to be regional issues they can be duplicated in other regions but I know ag has had some great success with their workforce development board's and some of their local issues and you had some. Great success but to not have to restart that process every time. I thinks incredibly important and how we still a tape that connection -- Not just to employers but the connection on what works what doesn't and how we streamline that process so that we can be more efficient and then be able to push more money to it is kind of the goal of of this committee. As one of just waiting and I think -- With -- Being here he a stake in the chair of the entire association say the California association of so I think Jeff to be a great kh do it because of the work that you do in. Your ship you provide. Yeah certainly you can pull everyone together so that we can making sure that resources and collaboration is is is out there so that we can make sure to actually see what's. Available because sometimes we don't we get our silos and we don't know what the right hand or left hand is doing. And I think -- Certainly when you're leadership capacity you can pull people one false the cracks. Thank you I'll do my best -- To Jess yesterday. We're just together and Bakersfield having conversation about all the jobs of that Bakersfield has available and transporting people from the Los Angeles basin area. To relocate and a lot of ways -- To Bakersfield and take on some of those job responses of Jan I was gather -- Yesterday cities leadership and all input by and by the way we're ready to go. Deals always ready to go. Leaders of thank you on that note. Dan vocal. Okay thank you very much assembly woman -- It's so difficult even know where to start you you you broach the question before about how to the connections how the connections made between -- The the the community colleges and education and the businesses and vice versa. Right before your very knows there are forty five workforce boards in California. Those workforce boards of the ones that they are the glue. To be able to connect those businesses to those educational institutions and to the educational institutions to the employers where they're some of the community colleges are working very closely with us El Camino is here today I see El Camino is -- We were it we're have a contract ending with El Camino one of the strong work force funds at the chancellor's office provides. Well. That's what community because reinvent the wheel is work with the existing organizations that can do that. And is such as what El Camino is doing and and other great community colleges are doing. The strong work force money is is very much needed and that the federal dollars that have come down for work for us over the past decade has been cut roughly So any additional funds like that strong work force or like what leases -- Cells are mentioned about AB one one one one because a year leadership -- Assembly woman and Mike Gipson leadership that was able to pass a will be getting additional resources which will help mitigate the losses at the federal level. So that's that's one thing. Another thing is not only community colleges it's educational system -- In my work in my work for Syria we have. Lots and lots of school districts. And we have a youth council and it meets every quarter and I look around the room and at any given -- Youth council meeting I might have nine or ten superintendents at that you've council meeting and we have some community colleges here we have got state the Mingus there. And they share ideas and and share resources as to what some colleges are doing and what other school districts need to be done. We're in Lawndale now so said no Union High School district is one of my district they have nine academies. For those kids in high school plus way -- Occupational training programs well we work very closely with them we've provided many employers and businesses to help the cabin Mayes and that's something that the work for the board should be doing in are doing. Throughout the state but we need the coordination. SpaceX I was listening -- To the young lady to my right over from SpaceX. There is a program called non destructive testing. Through American technical academy. Well they're on our list of providers. And we've literally. Trained dozens of people for SpaceX for that occupation why did we train them because they're needed SpaceX told us they're needed. So -- We work with the local businesses that way we've connected SpaceX with lots of the high schools in the area so that they can work. The engineering academies and that only seven alibied else el Segundo in Redondo Beach and many other districts -- What is the what what the? Is very important because now what they're doing is setting up certifications. Not just degree programs but certifications and what many of the individuals need to I think you're talking about today. Our certifications to get a job. I sure would like them all to get college degrees but that's not going to happen. In their individuals that if they're moving in the right direction and getting a certification in the area that the employers in businesses need. Then they're going to get a job so we're setting up the certifications working with the colleges community colleges and other schools so that after that certification is finished. They can get a job that's a we wanna do not now because I wanted to mention a couple of the things. Apprenticeship programs well. Because of where we are there's so much -- Construction going on a we're getting it thousand people hired at the very at the stadium in the Hollywood park -- Program. Many of them going into the apprentice programs the majority of them orientations every two weeks. But what we were thinking is okay the a job in their premise apprentice programs but we need more apprentice programs. So what we formed -- Couple years ago was a pre apprenticeship -- Aerospace program engineering program called Errol slacks. And we had a hundred pre apprentices go through that program. Now we have a fully blown certified -- Flex are engineering apprentice program for many of the defense industry companies Boeing Northrop impressa is a whole list of them that we have. We'd love to have space six join us on and and what we want to do is create a pool of individuals. That they can go right into the engineering program we had our first apprentice -- In role just last month through a company called Empresa locally here in Gardena. And we have the template. For it has to be designed by businesses that's the way it works they control the curriculum we have a consultant work with them to help design it. And then we pass it along to our great community colleges to help facilitate it down the line. That works so well that we said let's there let's use that template and design other apprenticeship programs. Now we're working on a bio flex program. For production technician lab technicians in partnership. With supervisor mark Ridley Thomas is very interested in that we're working on that right now a bio flex program down the line we have applications. Working with the state board hopefully we get funded for a cloud flex computer aerospace prop -- Apprenticeship program as well as a dental flex apprenticeship program. And transportation flex program so we want to take this model we want to do it in our area. We want to do it in your area head and Mike Gipson area roll that out in the LA basin so the LA basin hasn't. Then roll that out to the state. In our era flex program we're getting calls from Florida from other states that want to replicate what we've done. So I think we have the design and again it has to be employer driven that's the only way it works so we're going to have multiple apprenticeship programs going down the line -- Another important thing is. You know nowadays is a lot of people working I mean we certainly have those individuals that are unemployed and we're getting a marina employee. Using the prison system running special programs but many people are working but what they need is a lake up so that they can keep going. One of the programs that we have all to the problems the state of California has one is the employment training panel -- Camino. Can help businesses when employment training panel South Bay workforce investment board can help with -- Employment training panel to help those businesses upgrade skills. But we also have on a regular basis allocation 20%. Of our fine in the adult pro the program may be utilized for incumbent workers. So we can take individuals that are working and have them trained and many of this is certificate programs that are available and community colleges. Maybe additional combined with on the job training. And be able to upgrade their skills today and get them the better wages and it's available right now. Is available and we're doing it. All the time -- Ominous as assemblyman Gibson said we were at the meet the whole bunch of oil companies yesterday. In the past five years or so we've placed over thirty three thousand individuals and the refineries. Probably around. Thirty five hundred so we have ideas and what we want to be doing with that witcher well good paying jobs and and can support themselves. So there's very good things going on the state of California we want to keep it going want to concentrate on the training. And forget the paperwork and let's go on and train people. Thank you. So I do have a question what. In your experience what is the final thing that drives employers to actually come to your door what is that final step that makes them that. They get tired of not having the employees that they finally come to and then to the employers that are here with us today. What could we do to get to maybe to the workforce investment boards a little sooner to create that curriculum I realize it's a lot of work? I realize it's adjustment in the model of what you've done in the past what would incentivize and is a little thing that they say well. I I think it's geared to showing successes we have to show successes and they need to hear from the other businesses on what's been able to be accomplished. And we have a list of businesses that are willing to speak for us and be able to talk to other businesses about it because what we want to do it we want. To the workforce boards need to do all the work they need to do the paperwork they need to free the employers up of of of the bureaucratic stuff we'll we'll take care of all that. What they need to do is see the results and when they see the many people getting jobs when they see the thousands of people we've been able to get connect? To construction and oil companies and by the way with all the construction. That yields other jobs if you construct something you need support support people working there and that's what we need. So with that with the work force binding with these academies being -- Being built at various -- Public schools. And working closely with their work for sports in there one stop centers -- Great things are happening here -- Organizations we partner with those organizations the boards have all those organizations on our board we have the schools we have a plan to develop a different we have community based organizations we have. Almost any organization that that that work force is important too so they don't need to go to other organizations I need to go to the board. And work with those boards and tell them what they need and those boards will deliver the services for them. I'm speaking of boards you have -- Is there chambers of commerce relationship. With the greater Los and Sam ecommerce a the chambers of of of clippers it you know a tell you what we did a couple years ago we had all the chambers of commerce and are eleven cities come to a meeting. We invited all the economic development administrators from the eleven cities all sit down together. And some of the elected officials a little Valentine was at that meeting I seek counseling about Tonya. And we said the chambers and to the economic development directors of the city. What can we do for you just like we did with the health care you tell us what you need? And what they needed was mapping they needed asset. For the region to show where the spaces are so instead of a business moving out and moving to Texas we could say wait a minute don't do that. You want to move out of the city for some reason we have other areas right your backyard. So we created that for them -- Intern bàn study we did -- Throughout the South Bay because was requested of us with South Bay caught so we meet with the chambers all the time bring them together. And we're here to support the chambers one of the follow up question you made mention about the transportation program. Can you Jess -- Tell me a little bit about the transition from. Well the purchase program there. The what what the LA and by the Federal Highway Administration for example federal agency that -- Overseas a lot of the construction going on came to us. Because they said. How are you doing this job by? Being able to recruit all these individuals and to construction and transportation because frankly federal highway administration. Looks to serve the underserved individuals particularly African American males women and they haven't been able to do it. We've we've have 80% of the people that we recruited have been underserved population we just had a whole class of women graduate and go into apprenticeship program for the construction. So they designated -- Hollywood park project and LA acts one of the LA X. projects as pilot programs for FHA and nay funded us a little bit of money. To be able to keep doing what we do those projects and to provide the support services necessary you know people have to get from one place to another well they have to do that we have to figure out how best to do it. They need -- Money up front sometimes to join the unions you know and that we help them with that. So on the FHA came to us and we delivered they said we want we want to deliver fifty people we know you can't do it very fast. Because it takes us a long time will give you eighteen months we didn't two months. So -- And we work with metro like I said LA acts so -- And it all help because of that construction projects that we're doing we have orientation. Two weeks so they know that were there now in person will start doing it once a month into it it's every two weeks. So it's a matter of getting the word out getting the city councils to announce it -- Getting billboards up if we care. And and word of mouth they're one of the my final comment one of things that -- That I found out more more is the lack of individuals with their class a driver license to become truck drivers now. The drive up and down the seventeen freeways wanted fifty two thousand dollars a year all you need is a class a driver license. I know there's a great partnership that the California trucking so station dot money into the Long Beach City College speaking them can connect in the community college -- Where you can go get your class A. Dr licensing -- Right into a job make it fifty two thousand dollars a truck drivers there's a lot of jobs that's right billable. But we have no qualify skill individuals we have a class a driver license so is that something you can also look at to try to connect and make a real and relevant. So there there's a list at the state level it's called -- ETP L. it's a list of schools. More schools are put on that list from the South Bay workforce investment than any other area in the state we have thousands of courses available hundred to schools. And some of those a truck driver school some of them a great truck driver schools if they don't place the people we take them off the list they have to get jobs. For this two ways of doing it somebody can go up the street going to the training and do that or hire some people at a lower level. Than we can use our incumbent worker funds. To to provide additional training for that individual so they can go into the truck driving once they're already employed. So there's two ways of doing Thank you. Question. Okay. But more of a comment I mean earlier we mentioned that. Or someone had mentioned that we need like a conduit right to connect -- Business -- To community colleges it's for sports right. Forty five work was there that do it yeah there already are there are salute there is. A work. It's always a work sports so every every area at every he said geography and the state has a work force support. And they have one stop centers or whatever the official name is now American. I always I think that the per the successes that you've had all of all the programs that you listed. You know how do you replicate that in other areas. Any place in itself could just call us and we'll come up there and help them I mean we all work pretty closely together and thinking of my areas. To call you where I went when I northeast San Fernando Valley. In so where we have some aerospace manufacturing LA city at the city of LA yes so we work we work closely with LA city and all those the pre apprentice Y. said this a hundred and eighty pre apprentice slots. Slots that are available right through us so any workforce board in the LA basin that wants that individuals that want to stick their toll on the water see if it's for them. We can enroll them into that program right now. Okay yeah will follow up okay every time we have Janet a meeting members try to steal them from. I'm gonna figures of sars he's ours we Sharon. Thank you Dan for everything you do I we have a last speaker and I know we're running out of time in the room so I Ernesto Medrano from. The building trades thank you for being here. Thank you a similar burgers memory of us assembly member Gipson thank you have in the building trades here -- The bill the first represent a hundred forty thousand hard working men and women and Ellie in Orange County -- We represent about forty nine organizations of all the fifteen traits that are within the building trades. We have the greatest secret in north American that as our apprenticeship programs a lot of people don't know about them. And and blood that we're here to go to talk for your degree because we call it the other for your degree in our friendship. Goal to the apprenticeship work earn as you learn and be able to earn in the neighborhood of about sixty to seventy thousand dollars a year with no tuition. Note that health care pension all organized with all represented to collective bargaining and that's the bill the trade talks -- We take individuals out of your community out of poverty in poverty level and we will put on a path to middle class who are training upper collective bargaining process we invest approximately. Two hundred million dollars in the state of California to our front to training not public money not tax money it is our money that we negotiate collectively with or signatory employers. We represent 91% of the state certified of prizes not just doesn't include construction of other state certified a partnership comes out of our joint labor management schools. And that comprises approximately sixty thousand apprentices in the process right now to what the state of California -- We were very proud of what we do we feel we're the best in the business. What you turnout junior level in any of our trade you can go anywhere in North America with a journey level card go to Toronto Canada? Vancouver British Columbia you can go to New York for political Washington state and they'll recognize in any local union hall that you're and your trade. And you can go son of the book and be dispatched to go to work because that's the kind of training that we have uniform throughout the country -- We always to provide a skilled and trained workforce -- To to the industry and again it will we train our folks we work collaboratively. And collegial with our signatory minister number of apprenticeship as there is now we're the highest construction boom since the nineteen twenties then well were put a lot of folks for apprenticeship. In fact some of our facilities here in southern California or building on or acquiring other facilities because the demand is so high -- We also do our partnership agreement for project labor agreements we have. Community elements which are the local higher the veteran preference for help hardhat program will take a veteran we are coming out of the military for a program. And provide him with direct access into apprenticeship -- As well as the war project labor agreements they get this batch first -- As well as whoever's on the local higher -- Universe that we negotiate in that agreement so -- We're very proud of the work that we do with I know there was reference to talk about the apprenticeship reading this correctly will sprout for curriculum. That was established for the north American building trades it's a minimum of one hundred twenty hours it'll fulfill the high school level will fulfill. The eight three G. -- Entrance or requirements as an elective and we're very proud of that again as Chen was mentioning that's a place where -- A young man or woman could go and kind of as you say get your toes wet figure out do I want then you're walking apprenticeship a student a leg up and to come to our apprenticeships. We also partner with community colleges we also partner partner with your answer recidivism coalition with -- Formerly incarcerated with the flint ridge -- Center among many other organizations from the basin now let's talk about work opportunities out there I'm gonna rattle off a list of some of the project labor grimaced just in our area here around here. The port of Los Angeles for the project labor agreements for projects over two and a half million dollars city of Los Angeles. But we have a project the break room for all infrastructure work over two and a half million dollars at a close fire stations parks water and sewer treatment plants. LA community college district we have done the modernization of all nine campuses with over ten billion dollars a work to be done there LA unified. We build a hundred thirty one you schools and modernization of existence called approaching twenty seven billion dollars private work of to reference earlier. Which is the the rounds in the charger stadium and award the future clippers arena the future upper to the form and that's all local work with agreements with local higher. Again it was reference to the finding all or refineries under agreement of the Senate California promoting a skilled and trained workforce language and thank you assembly member Burke for supporting a chip championing actually. Senate bill fifty four that enable us to be able to do that city of Los Santos triple H. project agreement to build different tribes of homeless support of housing. And we're negotiations for the city of Raleigh how would like to do a lot of the have you and your call assembly many of our affront to supposed to I hope when you get to interact with your premise you get to see. The work that we do that we've been doing for many decades and again we're the greatest hidden secret so thank you for having us here I'll take any questions. Thank you for being here and I am a huge supporter of the building trades -- For my district you have been a direct access to a lot of very. Amazing great paying jobs that that not just -- Take care of the person who's getting a job with their families as well so I've always been a very proud supporter. Of the building trades but who do you have any idea how many apprentices you have right now and where they're coming from. Italian Orange County with the survey im gonna guess what five years ago maybe six years ago. And I think we had about four thousand apprentices we did a survey again about a year and a half two years ago we had over ten thousand a process. I'm going to guess it's a couple of thousand more than that so we have. It's called significantly and others no went to it because of the work that's out there in the future. And you know where they're coming from how you're finding them because I remember there was a time you all struggled a little bit with getting apprentices and what the changes been and how you've. Been able to find them obvious I mean it was reference of the workforce development partner with the workforce development board. Are agreements I think when we partner with like a school district a community college municipality. All the different stakeholders in the community classes and so it's a combination of the community now rolling up our sleeves and reaching out as as much as we can to recruit folks. I don't have a comment. When I was on the city council almost two years in Carson -- Through project labor agreements for one and then also -- I think out to tour all the princes programs was IBEW -- Pipefitters whatever -- They give especially those who are recent incarcerated opportunity I know the laborers -- They actually go into prison. And take those brothers and sisters out of prisons getting released and move them right into an apprentice program. Which is again a look giving those individuals the ability to write a new chapter I'm for their lives and also giving them a decent living -- We just we talked about some lifers who Jess got out and they're in a program and those individuals don't wanna go back to prison and so this is. Again. Over a new leaf a right in recent car. Place into a German program print program to get them and that out Jan. If they don't have their you know their equipment having the same conversation making sure there's a strong coordination so that no one falls through the cracks because I think there's a lot of jobs out here with with the work that we've done in Sacramento SP one and we're we're our ability. In the voters saving SP one and there's a bunch of jobs we want to make sure that we can team keep people unemployed in California so you do a great job Thank you. I want to thank this panel thank you for being here today thank you for all the work you've done and thank you. For your investment in workforce and the state of California we have the next panel. The next panel will come up. And will it [inaudible] The first I don't me Jeffrey -- Reset. Today say as seven oh sting us -- Assemblymembers Burke Reavis and Gipson I'm I'm happy to join you today -- From the California because chances office so greetings on behalf the chance that you lawyer. Oakley and also my executive vice chancellor longtime Quinlivan and I'm here to talk development. But before I tell you about today I'd like you to play a little game with me. We're on the verge of the for the Dodge revolution release has been spoken as such and we can take these little phones nowadays and click them in the head as in like what four years which is an Olympic cycle. Our technical assistance will be here on the planet beaming in through a virtual reality. This building will be smart interfaced. So it's not just about how do I get you a job today about how do we actually creates for teaching amounts for the state of California because it's workforce and economic development. So that's my favorite thing to talk about is how are we actually creating opportunity they're expanding our economy growing it verses just. Taking time to the minimum spew of it and saying are there enough jobs. Their jobs we are doing a great job of matching them. And the reason I think is we think too much in terms of occupation and not in terms of skill. In the article are the P. P. I see report that was reported at the top of this event. There is a coherent says. A workforce that cannot me or retain sufficient training for an in demand job is thus unable to take advantage of economic opportunities I think that's or hearing. And the next sentence that says moreover. The skills of the state's workforce will have an impact on California's national and international competitiveness. The failure to meet workforce needs could limit or alter the state's economic growth. Didn't say occupation. They said skills. What needs to back improve is are signaling between the ecosystem of workforce development community colleges K.? Twelve all of this and the the kind of framework we talk about it now so guided pathways how do students understand what the skills are in demand. How is the economy and employer signaling it? And so we see some interesting things. Now we're having a great day and workforce economical with me colleges we went from two hundred thousand invested in workforce and economic five years ago. To one point two billion now and are for jobs in the economy. Framework to help us roll out this in this this is where the eight ecosystem conversation comes into play where we've done a lot of work in systems development between. The commuter colleges and regions across the state as well as industry sectors across the state and that's where you're hearing. Some of these activities huge investments and apprenticeships especially new and innovative apprenticeships and so there's a lot of experimentation going on and are job with the can you college at the system level is to see. What's working and helping that scaling grow and replicate words words effective. Now. What we need to do is think of education not as lego blocks that we put together and stackable credentials like put these like was together we have to think of it as a freeway system? Where when you want talk about career technical education it's that acceleration lane you get on so you can go out speed on the freeway to the destination -- Going. And that we should continue to be life long learners because the demands. From the economic development that will see in the near future is that the jobs of tomorrow five years from now. Don't exist today and so those skilled dimensions of occupations haven't been form so how can education system which takes two years to develop curriculum. Become responsive. Those there are identify people's reading as a more discreet ways that we have a student say taking a two year study program. Has to job out or quit. They don't lose everything there's some indication learning. So using those little badges they're actually using little -- Meta data points for learning because we're not looking for knowledge all the knowledge of the universe is right here Google answer that question for you right now. What we're looking for skills which are performative? And we need indicators that show that I know how to perform. To I know how to the piano looking at me you couldn't tell but I could show you if I could. Well what if I could also someone who knows what good piano playing is certify my ability to do so and give me that a badge. That represents that. And so we see a lot of changing going on in terms of what reading this looks like for students. And most of its around reputation management like linkedin profiles or purfling profiles where they can show. Actual skills and I think the key is that it has we work and learned we can't afford to put students for two years. In a tacit knowledge experience -- The actual skills that they will be compensated for so we see more and more -- Work based arrangements -- Concurrent enrollment is also another huge -- Track we seen education trying to push people through the curricula process quickly but also to give them the actual performance of skill sets they need to the job. So much easier to get a job if you're already working in the workplace and people know you and you understand the process. Than it is to go through for your bachelor's degree and then just gone to the market hope you got hired. So those are some of the trends research and commute call as we continue to do all all these ecosystem developments I think there's opportunity to further develop the economic side of the house in terms of the ecosystems there between the ET seize the CDCs on that. ABC's and really take a very very strategic approach to whites and like. We all who's better positioned in this in the nation to leave before the dust especially with our new online conference space college and positioning ourselves to drive that economy through town development. And business opportunity entrepreneurship mindsets and so I think that is really the story to be telling about how. Can you colleges should be moving forward into tomorrow but in today were having a great opportunity to have a lot of funds available overseeing great outcomes. And you for a lot of those with our partners today and I'm just hoping to inspire a vision for what we could really do with it large capacity of the community college system. Unlike anywhere in the world have you ever -- Fifteen colleges like this. Sell parts are partners with CSU and you seen how much we partner with them in terms of producing pathways. So that's our mantra renown are marching terms is guided pathways help students find their path through. As well as provide wraparound services that ensure that the complete. Thank you okay. That's amazing at other. I was amazing but so they just tell me I'm running late so I'm gonna have everyone speak and then we'll come back to questions -- Jessica cam. Thank you know I'm. So I'm just Google cam and the director of workforce development at the a Sanders county economic development corporation. And I am excited to share with you guys how we as a region are responding to the future work. So here the only be in as many of you know we are quite large and bass and complex we have twenty one community colleges over seventy five colleges and universities. Seven workforce development board's at the forty America's job centers hundred dollar ad eighty one keep your total school district center others use our unions are community based organizations. And so forth and they're all being asked to connect to industry be industry driven demand driven put industry in the middle. Strength in your industry partnerships we saw he the twelve our workforce important each industry so our industry partners as an economic development corporation -- Like can I just talked to one if you right -- And so in our region. If we're going to be demand driven in terms of our work force an education system that we need to start with the research in applied work so what are what is the future for the labor and the demand. Side the supply. So what we're doing as Ellie EDC is working with our community colleges to take a look at our the over producing under producing what are it to the new clothes a course open of course. What is the future of work were also to having that same car received in with a workforce development board's in providing a study that allows them to take that labor market information? And think the future of working be demand driven and we are now engaging with our CSU system are California State University to have that same conversation so that they have the right labor market information. To think about the future of work and talk about things like automation tax. That research that informs our strategic industry engagement so the center for competitive work force is the largest LA regional strong work force project. Amongst the nineteen colleges and it's a strategic partnership between the nineteen community colleges of the alley -- C. R. C. Ellie EDC the center of excellence the research arm of the commute colleges. And Ellie chamber. And its strategic in the sense that we came together. To partner across the industry's stream Keats men and not duplicate and to understand what are the competencies we need. For on what it is not. In it for market. Yes. Information with Everitt. I'm up. Comes industry councils so beyond jazz -- A part of the industry gauge men is we only want to talk about your work force needs for an employer that could also be a put off very. A part of the industry engagement is to look holistically about what do you have tax incentive means land use issues workforce issues and to talk about it as comprehensive to me employer. And to speak their language and then to bring that back to the system -- In addition it also informs our workforce development council so we invite the entire work force and education community in LA county to a quarterly meeting. To talk about regional industry engagement regional industry business intelligence initiatives that cross across the system. And then to also hear back from everybody about what additional information what competencies who are you engaging as an employer can folks come to that meeting. And so we have pro actively side we will partner to host these meanings so that we can house one conversation about advanced manufacturing technical means. I'm and all of the strategic industry engage trees so -- Our bio are aerospace are -- Transportation and so forth. And all of this then informs our transactional work size I mention for CCW the center for competitive work force that goes into the course development. Employment engagement the work based learning the internship opportunities are industry councils is also the business assistance that they may need. And formalizing these industry feedback loops that are open for anyone to attend and we do know we share back with the community. We also men for workforce development council then is to bring not online meant to take the funding and see where we can all partner. And so as another part of the center for compatible force that we identified is C. C. W. smart match. So we also realize in talking with industry they may have high school internships are work first of imports do a great job there's alley summer you've higher here in the region. College and universities have internship programs in our graduate schools but what doesn't exist or the community colleges and so. We talked to employers about there's a half million folks being served in our region if we include Orange County we talk about three quarters of a million individuals of a talent. That you are not tapping into and so talking to them about internships levering our employer relationships so that we're talking about closing the skills gap. I mourn and most importantly in order for us to be demand driven industry responsive future forward in adoptive we also believe we need to connect in real time as the former panel had discussed. So we're creating any if which is the regional CRM more LED sees committed to push regional business intelligence. Our community colleges are all committed to being on it I mean gauging our workforce development board's to also use their regional funding to invest in it as well so that. Throughout our entire workforce and education system we'll be on one portable so an employer like Mister Dawson from chevron can come in and say Hey I'm looking for P. tack who has P. tack. And in real time our entire workforce education system will get that message and be able to reply an LED see on the back and will be able to monitor that to make sure there is a quick response. And so we do this easy W.. I need with the teens every other week -- To go over it so when I'm talking about taking this knowledge and connecting it back to the system it's an actual formalized loop -- And so we are hoping. LED see would also like to recommend when we envision workforce provided for keep to twelve the community colleges the workforce development board I'll have this funding telling regionally. And to engage industry the boat we would also be bold enough to ask that we consider for a cal state university system that the same type of investment. Is also made because a lot of the courses are thought to be matriculating upwards and so for leaving them out of the equation number leaving out that box are degreed. Opportunity which we now the higher level of education behind median weights and so we in the region have the CSU. Five so the five CS use in our region have connected you. To the relay institute and so my job an LED sees to know about all that I have the fortune of being mentored under dam vocal and formally working at south be with him. And so if you're actually wondering if this happens it definitely does -- I don't know if you've heard about the Amazon web services that the cloud computing certificate that was developed at a Santa Monica college. Is being replicated by on nineteen in the region so if you live in Compton you don't have to drive Santa Monica college and also because there elation agreements. And then based upon the great error flax model that's out the we've created we reach out to them to talk about clout flax and how do we bring the work force boards into the conversation as well. And take advantage of that and so what you're seeing in LA county is that there is this cross system alignment this regional engagement but it also comes at the expense of investing in this infrastructure. So that it can be continued replicated an employer can just go to one place to share an opportunity and get a response. Thank you. Thank you at Dr rack. Hi -- I'm a the dean of business at a Camino college and I do work closely with Jessica and I worked with her at Nguyen and Janet the web. And I'm working with their the LA the EDC and on the center for competitive workforce and various other things so -- I would like to say that I am thrilled to see the emphasis on career technical education. It's something in which I strongly believe I am a product of the community college I went to El Camino college. He got. And the degree in paralegal studies [inaudible] I went. Law school. Paralegal left debt so I would. Love to help other students do the same thing. So I I know the value of getting a skill. And using that skill to help put yourself through. Through -- Getting a career and that then that getting even moving up the scale as you go along -- We actually don't Camino have a couple of of new -- Programs that I think will help others do that you can stop along the way -- Use that skill for moving up to type one ago. And one of them is what Jessica brought up in that is the a WS a cloud certification. Program that is a we are one of the nineteen that is involved in that. All of our curriculum has passed through curriculum we will be offering the first courses in fall. Of for that program and we're really excited about that one of the interesting things about a W. S. was that it's not a huge monetary commitment -- It's a development curriculum and a very dedicated faculty member. Who is willing to go for the certification -- Who is willing to develop the curriculum to guided through and to get started? And to be involved with the other nineteen schools to make sure that we are on board. And they are all working as a team and I think it's it's been touted as the first time that's ever happened. So it's it's always interesting to see and and it all started with Santa Monica which I think if if you happen to know much about community colleges that's supposed to be a big competitor. So -- We're we're thrilled to be were was to be Amazon -- They were -- You know telling us what they needed -- To be able to certify these people to work for them so that is going to be we think huge -- When I talk with -- Santa Monica they opened their first class it was filled within an hour of opening it so. That the statistics are think was it two thousand jobs. And is two thousand jobs available a month -- In aid of U. S. so we're we're looking -- Of course now that's going to spread around all nineteen colleges so -- But but that is that you know it that I think that there's a huge opening and the the north far north is starting to ask how can we replicate what you're doing down there so we're we're we're excited about it. One of the program -- I'm going to mention it is up and running -- Has been and is has is -- Expanding we just offered our first on ethical hacking class we've been offering the the the first classes in that but this is that -- Ethical hacking class so I that also I think is going to be one we expand upon and are able -- To show a lot of of of promise in in -- Cyber security -- As you know. Everywhere you go there's everybody's being hacked -- And I read everything so -- There's a lot of opportunity and that from from the entry level -- Up is as high as you want to go. So -- Those are just a couple of the courses that were involved in in those courses were made possible -- Certain the A. W. S. was made that we got through strong work force -- And the strong workforce money has been very very helpful to us the cybersecurity program was made made possible through Perkins funding. So -- That's however we coordinating the solutions -- We are working again through strong work force -- Where are you on strong pathways with pathways? Being -- Right now we're working with that those plan is. To and to my to show students these are the possible careers that are out there this is what you would need to do. Familiarize them what is out there I think we're finding that they get to high school and I have no clue what occurred this I want to be this -- But have no idea what that entails so -- Try to familiarize them with with this would entail and this is the kind of career you would have this is how much money you might make and these are the kinds of classes you would need to take because she's if you. Want to be a brain surgeon you need to know you're going to see some blood you're going to need. To know a lot of science and math and things change while you're still in high school. So is so is there's a lot of things that that they need to to know and and we help. To guide them to help them along that we also are -- Are working with the with -- And that was a contract we entered into is just going to still with the web and that is they they will be doing some career fairs for us they will they are a focused career fairs. Where they will come on campus and? Eight eight for of and they're convene the employers for I bring them on campus and then we will of course bring the students and they some of them. Actually higher that days some of them just takes -- Resumes and things but it's a way to try to connect to students with the employers -- We also are -- Part of the regional -- Project that is a job developer we are in the process right now of hiring a job developer that job developer will work with the industry. They will work with the way ups they will work with LA EDC they will work with the others to try. To coordinate with industry to try to bring lawyers -- To understand the kinds of jobs -- We are are helping students prepare for and to to post jobs on campus so that students who are going to school who are graduates whatever will have access. To two jobs we are also -- Part of the C. C. W. -- We're doing deep dives into various professions and making that available to students to faculty to to everyone else -- We are part of the job speaker -- It's another regional where jobs speaker will be available to students will be available -- To faculty in their classes where job speaker is a software where students can post the skills they have attained. In their classes and similar -- To a Jeff was talking about where you you -- I took this class these are the skills I say this is the job that I'm looking for in these the skills I need a wait I see a student here has the skills. Connects the two and a so it's something that they can do on their own it's not something that we would. Require that they go through us to do so it's also something are job developer would be involved in to to try to help them. To to to coordinate that another -- Thing that we're involved in is the regional marketing we the region -- Put three million dollars into marketing and to help market up -- All of the programs in the region that still we're still working on that and hope that that that's going to be huge to bark at all the programs. In the region. Thank you. RO last panelist Merion humor hill was probably sick of us at this point we we see her. We we ask her to come to everything's. Thank you for being here today. Thank you very much for having me -- Night of it to share a couple things about myself because I have a connection to each of you in different ways -- Currently I am the executive director propel a which is the team supporting and the implementation of our county wide strategic plan which has seven big goals the goal one is all about investing in our people. And that has to do a lot with strengthening our work force and our education systems and we have the privilege of working with our stakeholders were involved in early childhood K. through twelve with the community colleges with the excuse used other universities. At all with adult of a multi service poverty relief agency in -- Assemblymember group me this is districts -- Called meant to meet each need with dignity he served at that average of thirty seven thousand low income clients per month. And many of them are working poor and so I'm absolutely passionate about what it takes to lift people out of poverty were making. Twenty thousand dollars a year less. What will it take to bring them into a livable wage jobs? And so I'd like to focus my comments on adult education as a resource that is kind of a silent partner in the work force system often unrecognized unknown. And yet -- For three reasons I feel like this is a a resource that is particularly well suited. To to to pulling in that particular workforce for the technical jobs that we have of the future -- First of all accessibility there a lot of adult eight campuses that are in low income communities or their operating classes in local neighborhood schools where people can go this morning I checked and where I've worked at men -- It would take three buses to get to the nearest community college and forty five minutes to an hour most of our clients. Came to our ESL classes are computer classes. By foot they walked where they rode bicycles. And the accessibility is really critical particular -- Population. Approachability -- You know for many of our clients they were immigrants from Mexico and from Central America And I know because I know a lot about committee colleges I know that our community colleges could meet their workforce needs. But I also know that their mentality was such that. They didn't see themselves yet as college material I'm they distancing themselves as being college but that wasn't part of their thinking. And in -- Adult add this kind of that bridge that gives them confidence through an ESL program or through high school equivalency where they can say yes now I'm ready to go to a community college but that that approachability factor is a big deal -- In that community. And then affordability -- Up on of the options -- For career technical education adult education is the least expensive. And in many cases free at all for this particular population so -- I feel strongly that we need to do all that we can to narrow the gap between rich and poor that equity factor that's so much a part of our life here in Los Angeles. And I you know I see adult ed here in in LA for example LA unified school district which is got that one of the biggest programs for adult at in the state -- Their training about thirty seven thousand students English right now -- Throughout our county it's about a hundred and ten thousand students are getting ESL classes through our community colleges as well as through adult ed. But there's one point five million people are county that don't speak English for don't speak it well how do we reach them so that we can then prepare them. For those jobs of the future -- I think we really need to expand that. Apprenticeships -- Adult it has the largest apprenticeship program in California with sixty one trades represented. And for that are under development seventy five hundred students. So -- So they're well positioned again to meet this particular population so my courage meant would be that we increase the adult ed block grant ABG which is AB -- One oh for in the coming -- Fiscal year -- Of our lowest income residents in our region [inaudible] Thank you. Thank you any questions comments Not. We're running a time so at this time will invite anyone who needs to make wants to needs to make public comment. If we have any I don't even know where they going. Out. No no one is make a comment. There. Yeah Hey okay -- With that I would like it if there's no further questions or comments I like to give you a chance to close -- The all of you today -- I want to thank you. For all the information that you provided in all of the insight -- My most of my career I've worked in K. through -- Twelve education and I'm really stem education and thinking about the future work force -- But now as an assembly member I have constituents that. One of you know they're not the not just about the future they're thinking about the present and like adults is definitely something that I'm. If we want families to have a better life of or quality of life for children we need to think about the adults and and they're the current career and not just the children's future -- In so. The is the thank everyone for being here is not just this. This issue is I'm very passionate about it to you to workforce development and especially highly skilled jobs -- Into one thing. Of the Queen Mary on what you were mentioning I know we have -- The connection because of the community and men -- But also thinking of non English speaking adults right where. If you before thinking like -- Jeffrey said about skills rate and skills do you necessarily have to speak English to develop that skill and and I know I grew up in Pacoima an I know a lot of people in the community to have skills -- And are ready for the work force but the barrier is maybe taking the English class at the community college level or you know if that. What may be required and of more of the skill and so how do we? Like a badgers certify them and and the way that. Some employers they just want to hire someone that knows how. To do the particular skill has a skill read -- In so -- You don't think you. I think all of you combined I think are having right now I'm thinking about what we can do and and I definitely want. To stay in touch with you and collaborate so thank you Gipson. Thank you very much first I want to say thank you to our chairwoman and to also member revised. And falls of the great Pat a what the great information you provided for us -- I represent the six poorest issue can entire state of California so jobs is very very important -- To the people which I represent what I unemployment rate was eleven point 9% today as hover around for I'm skews me six point 3% of my district -- That's still not good enough I wanna make sure -- That we have is a a work force a skillful workforce that can meet the growing demands -- Specially here in California California's growing. By leaps and bounds and there's a number of jobs that people are not qualified and skillful enough to do those kinds of jobs. So the work in the conversation we have today is very very important I look forward to working with -- Both of these -- Vivacious a courageous women here moving -- Possibly public -- Policy -- For the next legislative session two thousand nineteen to help move us for so again thank you very much for all the to contribute today and other for working with each. One of you in two thousand nineteen happy hour spent -- I mean how do you beat that I just I want. You know when that my mom used to state not to meet with she said. She would be out speaking and she would say you've nap to young people and she would say I promise you you've never heard of what you're going to do by the end of your career. Unfortunately for me that is not what happen to me I heard. I had heard of this job before because she had it -- But yet here we are -- Will have million jobs in two thousand twenty five that will need a certificate or less to fill them -- We are also at the lowest unemployment we have seen in a very long time yet we are struggling still with the highest. Poverty and obviously each one of our panelists are doing incredible work toward making sure that that no longer that continues to be the case -- We are past the point of wanting peace it is now coming on us to make sure people have careers. Not just living livable jobs but real career some real opportunity and I want to think everyone on the panel for the entire day for that. I'm your continue commitment and I reiterate what us only member gives in and and lose and we never reva said which is. The hopes of today are that we've gotten some information to move some legislation to help you do your job a little easier -- To make it a little more streamlined for you to see six that's because when you all see six at the state of California truly sees great success so thank you for everything you do. Thank you for being here thank you both assembly members for being here today and with that we are adjourned things have a great holiday [inaudible] Well -- But
