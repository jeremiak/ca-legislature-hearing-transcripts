IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU

HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU WORK WITH

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.212
THE OPPOSITION AND SHOW ON AND I

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.079
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:08.180
HAVE AND I'M SU MEAN YOU'RE

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:09.949
WORKING IT OUT WERE YOU ALREADY

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:11.751
HAVE AND THAT IS.

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:12.551
YOU'VE GOT A BUYER YOU GOT A

00:09:12.618 --> 00:09:16.756
SELLER IN THE SELLER -- IS --

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:19.058
SEEKING TO SELL SURE HE WILL GO

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.527
AHEAD AND ASK FOR AN INSPECTION

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:23.129
OF SOME SORT SEE EXACTLY WHERE

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.196
IT STANDS.

00:09:24.263 --> 00:09:25.698
AND THEN I WOULD IMAGINE THAT HE

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:28.034
WOULD DISCLOSED TO THE BUYER.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.803
THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT --

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.505
RETROFITTED THE HOUSE DOES NOT

00:09:32.571 --> 00:09:33.940
HAVE THAT FIREPROOF ROOF.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.942
AND THE ADDICT IS NOT SECURE

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.144
FROM MEMBERS COMING IN AND TO

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.745
CONSEQUENTLY THE BUYER AT THAT

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:42.114
POINT WOULD HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE.

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.283
WALK INTO THE TRANSACTION AND

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.419
SECURE THE HOME BUT THEN HIS --

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.488
ABLE TO GET A HOME LOAN A

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:52.124
REVOLVING LOAN WHICH WOULD PAY

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.693
FOR THE THE UPGRADES THAT ARE

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.393
NEEDED.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.395
AND AT A LOW INTEREST RATE AND

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.464
SO ON AND EVEN TO SOME POINT A

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.099
REBATE WILL BE GIVEN.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.435
SO IT WOULD BE IT -- IT SHOULD

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:04.203
BE A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC BUYER TO

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.605
BE ABLE. TO TO RETROFIT IS HOME

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.675
AND FOR FIRE SAFETY -- ENDED.

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.544
AND I'M ASSUMING ALONG THE WAY

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.947
IF A HOMEOWNER HAS NO -- THOUGHT

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.550
OF SELLING THAT HE WOULD ALSO BE

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:21.620
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS -- REBATE AND

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.457
LOAN AND AND JUST MAINTAIN HIS

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:25.658
HOME FOR YEARS TO COME.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.260
SO BOTH SIDES I THINK -- THE

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:29.996
CONSUMERS PROTECTED AND SCHUMER

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:32.198
HAD RECEIVED INFORMATION.

00:10:32.264 --> 00:10:38.371
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HERE IN

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:39.005
CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO PREVENT

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.306
A FIRE.

00:10:40.373 --> 00:10:41.841
IN HAVE PREVENTED FROM FIRE FROM

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.476
SPREADING SO THAT WE WORK WITH

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.011
THOSE ARE THE TWO OPPOSITION.

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:45.678
THAT YOU I THINK YOU NAILED IT --

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.346
WE THAT IS THAT IS THE PATH WE

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:49.281
HAVE TAKEN AND AS YOU SEE THERE

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.450
WAS NO THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.085
AS TO FIGHT TODAY AND WILL

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.320
CONTINUE WORKING WITH FOLKS I

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:56.155
THINK THE DISCLOSURE IS CRITICAL

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:58.124
I THINK -- AS A BUYER JADA NOW.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.026
AS A SELLER JADA NOW AS A

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:01.894
HOMEOWNER JADA NOW THAT YOUR

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.529
HOUSE ISN'T NECESSARILY FIRE

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:07.733
SAFE AND SO -- WE'RE ALSO

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.268
WORKING -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.169
FRIEDMAN HAS A BILL THAT WILL

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:13.139
HELP IDENTIFY LOW COST RETROFITS --

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.875
I WAS LOW COST HIGH VALUE ON THE

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.209
OTHER END THERE ARE SIMPLE

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:19.245
THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:20.346
YOUR HOME BUT IF YOU AS A

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.948
HOMEOWNER DON'T KNOW THAT --

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.417
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:26.652
PURSUE THAT AND THE END OF THE

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:27.920
DAY IN THIS IS NOT TRYING TO BE

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:29.422
PUNITIVE THIS ACTUALLY TRYING TO

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.523
BE HELPFUL.

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:32.224
BUT CHANGING BEHAVIORS HARD

00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:34.427
PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:35.995
CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND I WOULD

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:37.496
IMAGINE WE'RE GOING TO START AN

00:11:37.563 --> 00:11:39.098
OUTREACH PROGRAM PROMOTE THE

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.299
FACT THAT.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.867
THIS IS AN AFFECT THOSE PEOPLE

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:43.636
WHO ARE REMAINING WHO WOULD LIKE

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:44.937
TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES THEY

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:45.538
CAN GO AHEAD AND OBTAIN HOSE

00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:46.539
LOANS.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.307
AND EVERYONE OF THOSE AFFECTED

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.843
AREAS WOULD BE AWARE OF IT YEAH

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.445
I THINK I BELIEVE OUR CAR FIRE

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:53.846
OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS ARE

00:11:53.913 --> 00:11:56.549
RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS --

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:58.184
THAT WORK LOCALLY -- TO HELP

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.685
PEOPLE -- PROTECT THEMSELVES

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:00.686
FROM FIRE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:02.421
ENTHUSIASTIC AMBASSADORS FOR

00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:05.157
THIS PROGRAM AND I'M CONFIDENT

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.325
THAT THAT THEY WILL GET THE WORD

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:07.126
OUT.

00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:11.397
I THINK THE BILL WILL SAVE LIVES

00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.699
AND PROPERTY THANK YOU.

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:15.000
OKAY ASSEMBLY WE DO NOT HAVE A

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:18.604
IT'S IMPORTANT.

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.839
I THINK THIS IS THE NEW NOT

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:22.975
NORMAL TYPE OF THE END OF THE

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.076
ROAD THE REAL ESTATE

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:26.912
ORGANIZATIONS ARE GONNA HAVE TO

00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:28.347
GET USED -- TO I BECAUSE I I

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.082
THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:30.950
THAT WE START.

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.184
PARDEE HOMES ONE OF THE THINGS

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.586
AS WE WERE.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.621
WORKING ON HOW QUICKLY YOU

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:38.591

THERE WERE SOME IMPROPRIETIES

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:17.335
BUTWITH THIS BILL LEVELS THAT

00:32:17.402 --> 00:32:19.404
OFF -- THOSE WHO ARE WORKING

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:20.872

SOMETHING THAT POTENTIAL

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:27.078
LONGLEY'S IT'LL COME BEFORE THE

ANY COMPLAINTS FROM THE VETERANS.

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.174

THE ID CCTV HAS TAKEN OR THEIR

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:13.691
MANAGEMENT AT THE HOME IS TAKEN

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.993
AT ANTI COMMUNITY.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.130

RECENTLY THIS WAS A STANDALONE

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.020
DEPARTMENT.

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.922
IT HAS BEEN ROLLED UNDERNEATH

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:12.889

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:14.558

RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARKS IT'S

00:48:39.383 --> 00:48:41.451
