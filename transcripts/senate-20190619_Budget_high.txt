THE BILL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING FOR THE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT AS WELL AS THE EARLY MORNING AND CARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT -- FOR THE FIRST DOES IT INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER TH NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT'S A MIX OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDS -- AND FOR THE SECOND INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THAT COMES FROM STATE MONEY. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES -- SIGNIFICANT -- FUNDING AND CHANGES -- WITH REGARDS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION -- IT WILL BRING ELEAZAR THE STATEWIDE BASE RATE AND ALSO INCLUDE A SPECIAL AT THE EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION PRESCHOOL GRANT PROGRAM THESE ARE FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH AN INDIVIDUALIZED. EDUCATION PLAN -- AND THESE THIS FUNDING IS PREDICATED ALSO ON THE ON GOING NEED FOR REFORM THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT SO WE WILL BE TAKING THOSE CONVERSATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY AS WE HEAD INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET CYCLE.

THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR TEACHER GRANTS AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

SO HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON THOSE OR ANY OTHER ITEMS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTIONS MEMBERS [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN. THE SAID THE CHARTER SCHOOL PROVISIONS LIKE [inaudible] CORRECTLY. IT'S KIND OF LEVERAGE. ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. WHY DO WE HAVE? TO DEAL WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN THIS BUDGET [inaudible] SPIRIT PUNITIVE [inaudible] CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN A CHARTER SCHOOL IN THE AREA THAT BURNED. UNDER PROVISION HERE WE NOT BE ABLE TO EVEN OPEN. WHY ARE WE DEALING WITH CHARTER SCHOOLS? TELL MAKE TWO BRIEF COMMENTS AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA I THINK THE FIRST IS SOME OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS AND SO THOSE WE FEEL TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL FACT IN TERMS OF WOW THOSE PLANS WORK HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED SO WE DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEAL WITH THAT AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. THE SECOND REASON AND I KNOW THIS IS COME UP FOR A LOT OF DISCUSSION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION AROUND THE IMPACT BETWEEN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS AND WHEN STUDENTS ARE ENROLLING IN ONE VERSUS THE OTHER. EACH SCHOOL AND EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS TO DEAL WITH THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF THAT SO WE THINK THAT. ANY CHANGES THAT MAKES SENSE THAT AFFECTS THOSE PREVENT THOSE FISCAL THAT HAD AFFECTS THAT FISCAL SITUATION IN THE DISTRICT IS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION IN THIS BILL AND JESSICA MAY WILL. YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. SCHOOL HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD ADD -- IS THATSPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE DISASTER RELATED FUNDING FOR THE BUDGET DOES PROVIDE FUNDING TO BACK FILL LOSS -- AND I'LL SEE IF I FUNDING AND OTHER TYPES OF FUNDING STATE FUNDING FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THEY MAINTAIN AT LEAST OF THEIR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE SO THAT THEY DON'T DROP SO LOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE OVER THE LONG TERM. SO THAT IS THE PROVISION THAT WE HAVE IN THERE ON THE CHARTER SCHOOL PIECE TO ENSURE THAT -- THIS SCHOOLS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING MAINTAINED FUNDING FOR ACTUALLY VIABLE AND CONTINUE ON TO FUTURE YEARS. THE CHARTER SCHOOL IN. IN PARADISE BECAUSE OF THE DISTINCTIVE STATION. GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE EVEN THE LOWER GOAL SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR OVERALL POSITION THERE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO HELP THAT ONE PART CHARTER SCHOOL AND YOU CANNOT CONVINCE ME THAT THIS OVERALL PLAN IS NOT. THE END OF THE DAY. KIND OF A COVERT WAY OF ATTACKING. CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE CAN DO SOME ACCOUNTABILITY HOW ABOUT FOR K.. TWELVE EDUCATION. WE CAN'T WE DO SOME MORE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THEM IN THIS BUDGET ISN'T THAT A PART OF THE DEAL. MAYBE YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION WE WILL CONSIDER THAT AND I COULD ACCEPT THAT. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A NARROW FOCUS. THEN I WANT TO THANK YOU TOO FOR THE FOR THE GOVERNOR FOR THE AND THE LEGISLATURE'S FOR THE SUPPORT FOR THE BOOK A CRITIC BOOKCASE VOCATIONAL AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. BUT THOSE PROVISIONS INITIAL POSITIVE. IT MAKES IT PRETTY TOUGH FOR ME TO VOTE. FOR THIS BILL. BECAUSE OF THE OTHER. ASIANS THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO ME. ARE WE REALLY BUILDING EDUCATION. I KNOW THIS IS A GREAT BOLD MOVE TO THE FUTURE. THE GOVERNOR'S BEHIND IT. THERE'S MERIT TO IT. BUT SOME OF THE FRANKLY IS A LITTLE HARD TO TAKE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU AND PRESIDENTE. MANAGER -- ELABORATE ON THE SPECIAL TREATMENT FOR LA COUNTY SCHOOLS YOU KNOW THE I GUESS WE HAVE A A RATIO OF IT MINISTRY YEARS TO TEACHERS THAT EXISTS AND AND THE STATE THEM. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AN EXEMPTION AND US IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS PROBABLY THE NATION'S LARGEST OF THE SECOND NATION'S LARGEST THAT -- JUST HAD A BALLOT MEASURE TO TRY -- TO ENHANCE THEIR THEIR FINANCES AND HOPEFULLY GET MORE MORE STUDENTS INTO THE CLASSROOMS -- IF THEY'RE NOT MEETING -- THIS EXPECTATION ANOTHER WORD SURFACING TO BE ABLE TO TOP HEAVY WHY WOULD WE WANT THEM. TO SEND OUT A LITTLE BIT -- TOO EASE THEIR ECONOMICS AND HOPEFULLY GET MORE TEACHERS INTO THE CLASSROOM TO WHY WE MAKING EXCEPTIONS WHEN THERE MIGHT BE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE. HAVING THE SAME ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST. SO THIS IS AN EXEMPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE PROVIDED TALLY UST IN LAST I THINK THREE EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS. WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IS -- IN THOSE YEARS THEY WERE SINGLE YOU'RE EXEMPTIONS WITH NO OTHER REQUIREMENTS WE JUST WAVES THE THE RATIO REQUIREMENT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN INTO THE PENALTY -- BUT THIS YEAR'S -- WAIVER REQUIRES THAT -- LA REPORT OUT SPECIFIC DATA THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS PUT TOGETHER REPORT THAT SHOWS HOW THEY ARE GOING TO MEET. ON THE ADMINISTRATOR TEACHER RATIO IN THE FUTURE SO WHAT IS THEIR PLAN FOR REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATORS SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY MEET THAT IN THE FUTURE. AND NOT HAVE TO COME TO LEGISLATURE THE MINISTRATION FOR WAIVERS ON EACH YEAR OKAY BUT WHY NOT WHY NOT -- AND THAT PROVISION TO ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MAYBE SMALLER BUT HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND GIVING THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REGULATIONS. YES I THINK -- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE STAFF -- YOU KNOW THIS WAS SORT OF THE THE ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED -- THAT HAD KIND OF COME IN AND ASKED FOR THIS AND AND WE HAD DECIDED THAT WE WOULD GO AHEAD AND DO THAT BUT THAT WE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THEM -- TO COME TO US WITH WITH MORE OF A IT HAS. IDEA OF HOW THEY WERE GOING TO TO COME TO COMPLAINTS IN THE FUTURE. YOU KNOW I I USE THE JUST -- HOW MY OWN TIME AND IT'S? IT WE NEED TO SEE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AT DID DO THEIR BEST TO TRY TO BRING. THEIR THEIR ECONOMICS -- INTO -- INTO THE REALM OF OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY AND AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. HE SAW A BALLOT MEASURE IN LA FAIL IS BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WEREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO KEEP THEIR THE FINANCES UNDER CONTROL AND MY FEELING IS IF. WE ARE GOING TO BE OFFERING THESE TYPES OF EXEMPTIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE FAIR AND WE SHOULD BE UNIVERSALLY ALLOWING THEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT MAYBE SOME TRENDS TRANSITION TIME AS WELL -- BUT THANK YOU FOR ANSWER THE QUESTION. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS [inaudible] SINGING NOT. SEEN ON ANY PUBLIC COMMENT.

THE CONDITIONS ARE MET -- THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE LANGUAGE -- IS EQUAL 21% OF THE COUNTIES -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN M. A WEEK [inaudible] SO -- YOU KNOW THAT THE THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THIS LANGUAGE IS IT ONLY APPLIES TO THOSE COUNTIES TO I DO NOT HAVE AN EXISTING -- CONTRACTOR -- INTO.

NOW THE COUNTIES NO THAT THE STATE IS READY TO WAIT IN AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ANYTIME THAT THERE'S ENOUGH PRESSURE. AND STACKED THE DECK AGAINST THE COUNTIES. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY. AND PREVIOUS GOVERNOR. DUMPED. A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY. AND EXPENSE ON OUR COUNTIES IN REALIGNMENT. THAT HAS NOT BEEN RECOMPENSED FOR THOSE COUNTIES. ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND PUT HIM IN REAL TROUBLE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE THE INCREASES AT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE A PROGRAM THAT IS OF A BILLION DOLLARS UPSIDE DOWN AND IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN FELT -- HIT THE INLAND REGIONAL CENTER WHERE -- YOU HAVE FORMER CONTRACTORS IT WILL NO LONGER CONTRACT ANYMORE WHICH MEANS WE HAVE -- A DECREASE ACCESS TO SERVICE FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY THE INLAND REGIONAL CENTER TATERS DOUBLE STANDARD IN ACCOUNTING AND AND BURST I COUNTY WHICH AS A COLLECTIVE POPULATION ABOUT FIVE NINE PEOPLE. SO. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF NOT NOW WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS. CAN I JUST I JUST CAN'T COMPREHEND WHY -- I I ASSUME THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS A SOFT HEART FOR THOSE DEVELOPING DISABLED. KIDS AND ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS WE HAVE A RATE STUDY THAT'S BEEN GOING ON WE AS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE -- THREE ACTUALLY WITH. PUSHED A VOTE. TO SHOW A WE SUPPORTED IN 8% ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE -- THE RESTORATION OF SERVICES THAT WERE -- DECIMATED DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND NOW I SEE THAT -- WERE KIND OF CHERRY PICKING THOSE SERVICES THAT WILL GET SOME INCREASES SOME TWO TO EIGHT POINT 2% TO THE NUMBER SERVICES ARE GOING TO STILL GET [inaudible] ZERO SO. HOW CAN WE -- ARTICULATED THE GOVERNOR IS IN THE CORNER. OF THOSE DEVELOPING DISABLED KIDS AND ADULTS THAT. DON'T HAVE THE HIGH PRICE LOBBYIST COMING HERE IN FIGHTING FOR THEM THEY DEPEND ON US TO ENSURE THAT. THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SOMETIMES DEPEND ON TO LIVE FOR YOU KNOW -- ARE AVAILABLE I HAVE -- A CONSTITUENT PETER THAT I I LIKE TO GO SEE IN. DESERT HOT SPRINGS AND THE SO WONDERFUL YOUNG MAN -- IS A PARAPLEGIC -- LIVES WITH A RESPIRATOR PASSED HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE. COMMUNICATES THROUGH AN OPTICAL MOUSE. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE CAN GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP. KNOWING THAT HE CAN HAVE THAT TWENTY FOUR HOUR SERVICE BECAUSE HE CAN'T HE CANCEL COME TO US. A SIXTY MINUTE DELAY IT WITH ELECTRICITY GOING OFF AND HIS RESPIRATOR. NOT FUNCTIONING APPROPRIATELY -- WILL BE HAVE SUCH BUDGET SURPLUSES WHY ARE WE PUTTING A BIGGER DOWN PAYMENT ON A RESTORATION THOSE RATES. TO ENSURE THAT. THE NEEDIEST OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ARE ARE GETTING SERVICES AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE SPENDING MONEY -- IN OTHER AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THE THE MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE THE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT. THESE KIDS AND ADULTS NEED. I'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS AND MY COLLEAGUE TO RESELL WILL SPEAK TO IT AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST IS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE GOVERNOR YOU ARE RIGHT THIS IS A SHARED PRIORITY AND IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO EVERYONE -- WITH REGARD TO THAT FINDING -- YOU'RE ALSO CORRECT THAT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET -- PLUS -- ONE THAT'S NOT BY ITSELF GOING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT IS A MEANINGFUL COMMITMENT AND DEPENDING ON THE FISCAL SITUATION YOU KNOW WE HOPE IT'S THE FIRST STEP OF A BROADER COMMITMENTS -- BUT BECAUSE THIS IS AN ONGOING PROGRAM INTO YOUR POINT IN THE STORY THAT YOU TOLD THESE ARE ISSUES THAT DON'T GO AWAY AFTER A YEAR WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BROADER BUDGET CAN SUPPORT THAT. WITH REGARD TO THE RATE INCREASES SPECIFICALLY -- SINCE OUR NAY REVISION NOW WE DID HEAR THE FEEDBACK FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT THOSE RATE INCREASES DO NEED TO BE MORE BROAD BASED AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS REFLECTED IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT TERESA MY COLLEAGUE CAN SPEAK TO THAT IS THANK YOU. THE COLOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS CRACKED THE MAYOR VERSION WHICH WAS A MUCH MORE TARGETED APPROACH WITH HIGHER PERCENT FOR FEWER CATEGORIES ARE IS ABOUT FIVE SERVICE CATEGORY SAID IT LOOKED AT UNDER THIS BROAD BASED -- APPROACH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE SOME THAT IN INDICATED IF THEY'RE INDICATING THE RATE STUDY WOULD HAVE A ZERO OR NEGATIVE PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE RATE STUDY -- FINDINGS THAT THOSE WOULD NOT RECEIVE AN INCREASE UNDER THIS SO THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY THANKS EXPLANATION NAIVE -- I APPRECIATE THE THE INCREASES THAT ARE BEING GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO GIVE -- THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE KNOWN FOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED COMMUNITIES AND FUTURE ANSWERS FOLLOWED BY. YES I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. OF ALLOCATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. BUT THE WAY KIND OF I LOOK AT THESE ARE. FUNDS THAT ARE GOING TO INDIVIDUALS. PEOPLE I SEE EVERY WEEK. THAT HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND WHAT I SEE WHEN I SEE THESE PEOPLE AS I SEE. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WORKING IN THERE. OF SUPPORT SERVICES LEAVING BECAUSE THEIR WAGES ARE SO LOW. I SEE -- OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES CLOSE I'D LIKE YOU TO SIT DOWN FOR MEDICAL USE THAT SOME THE KIND OF BOTHERED ME A LITTLE BIT OKAY. THE RESIDENTIAL THE RESIDENTIAL -- IT MEANT FACILITIES ARE CLOSING THERE'S HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES ARE CLOSING ESPECIALLY IN HIGH COST HOUSING AREAS LIKE MINE. SO WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THE THEIR CLOSING AND THE THE THE FACILITIES ARE CLOSING. AND ARE NOT BEING REPLACED BY OTHER HOUSING SO. THERE'S NO PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE. ARE WE IN FACT HAVE HOMELESS DEVELOP ME DISABLED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE ALL SAID AGAIN WE HAVE HOMELESS DEVELOPMENT DISABLED. PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. SO. WHEN WE SAY WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT CUTTING THE COST OR THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK THAT'S A MISNOMER I DON'T I DON'T BUY THAT? I SAY THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED. AND I SAY THANK GOODNESS FOR GOVERNORS AND PUT IN SOME MORE MONEY INTO IT. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. OF FUNDING THE HEALTH CARE. THAT THERE NEEDED AND THAT WAS DONE BECAUSE WE STARK. IT IT TO OURSELVES TO PAY FOR IT BY RAISING TAXES AND PAYING CLOSE EFFORT EXTRA. MCO TAXES AND OTHER OTHER TAXES TO PAY. FOR AND I THINK THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WILLING TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. JUST TAKE A POLL. IT'S VERY CLEAR. SO I I WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD EVERYBODY THAT WORKED ON THIS. I THINK THIS IS VERY GOOD WE DID A VERY GOOD JOB IS NOT THE END GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT IT WAS A BREAK A BREATH OF FRESH AIR THIS YEAR COMPARED TO THE PAST. AND I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY SO WHEN WE GET TO STAKEHOLDER GROUP TOGETHER. LET'S THINK ABOUT [inaudible] THE PEOPLE. THEY ARE BEING SERVED. THE FAMILIES THE PEOPLE AND AND THE WORKERS THAT ARE THERE IN THE SYSTEM LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THEY THINK. THIS TO A SURVEY OF THEIR THEIR NEEDS. AND THEN ALSO I SAY THIS THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. THAT ARE DEVELOPING DISABLED CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T GET ANY SERVICE. SO OUR JOB IS TO FIND THEM. AND TO SERVE THEM. THAT'S WHAT THE LETTERMAN ACCESS FIND THEM ANSWERED WE GOTTA FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE THEY ARE GETTING THE SERVICES. AND AND THOSE SOME OF MICHAEL'S THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BAIL AND AND PLEASE UNDERSTAND IT WAS NO DISRESPECT INTENDED -- ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE IS COME OVER AND THEY'RE KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR BECAUSE THEY ARE WAITING FOR FINANCE TO GO PRESENT ON A CRITICAL TRAILER BILL -- AND SO THAT'S WHY MISTER THIS ONE OFTEN WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE WE APPRECIATE THAT I'VE SEEN THEM COME IN THE DOOR TWICE TRYING TO GET YOU SO PLEASE GO AHEAD.

BIOLOGIST I'LL JUST ADD ON IS MISTER VISWANATHA AND GOES AND RUNS AROUND THIS BUILDING AND DOING HIS DUTIFUL WORK AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT SIR WE KNOW YOU GOT A LOT ON YOUR PLATE -- KEEPING THE PROMISE IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN ENDEAVORING TO DO THIS YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK. WE HAVE ALL THE BONES OF A PROMISING BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON THIS PORTION OF THE BUDGET. I KNOW THERE'S SOME CONSTERNATION AND RIGHTLY SO THAT. THE PROMISE IS NOT YET FULLY FULFILLED. WHAT CAME OUT OF THE BUDGET SEVEN I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM SANGER STEPPING UP IN IN HER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND MAKE AN IMPORTANT MOTION IN? MY COLLEAGUES FROM ALL OF THIS STATE AND STEPPING UP -- YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD -- I THINK BY THE NUMBERS ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS LOSE CARE IN THE PAST NINE YEARS. THIRD OF THE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STAFF THAT WE HAVE IS LEFT THE PROFESSION DUE TO SUBSTANDARD WAGES. YOU KNOW THE THIRD BY THE MOST RECENT DATA WE'VE SEEN THAT HAVE TO ACTUALLY WORK A SECOND JOB TO AVOID FALLING INTO POVERTY SO WHILE THEY'RE DOING THIS JOB THAT IS NOT LIKE A NORMAL JOB. THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW -- FIXING WIDGETS THIS IS PEOPLE -- SO WITH HIS. TRULY HUMAN -- CHALLENGE I THINK WERE UP FOR IT APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING. I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL TRY TO FIND A WAY TO SAY YES AND HOLD HANDS TOGETHER AND MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND NOT DIVIDE OURSELVES OVER THE PROMISE YET NOT FULLY FULFILLED -- SO THANK YOU TO DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND FOR ALL THE LEADERSHIP AROUND THIS DIET SO WORK ON THIS ISSUE I'M HOPING WE CAN. WE CAN JUST JUST SAY YES AND LET'S PUT THE POLITICS BEHIND US AND MOVE FORWARD AND HELP THIS COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT FINISHED SENATOR STERN AND I WILL JUST SAY FINALLY -- HAVING CHAIRED BUDGET SUB THREE IN THE SENATE SUB ONE IN THE ASSEMBLY DURING THE YEARS WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AND GO HOME AND TALK TO A CONSTITUENT ALL THE LAB DONE THAT.

WE THANK THEE WE THANK THEM MEMBERS WE THANK THE GOVERNOR. AND WE THANK EVERYBODY FOR COMING OUT AND SUPPORTING DDS DDS IS ALWAYS BEEN CUT AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONE IS REQUIRES A LIST OF GREED UPON SERVICES PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS AT THE CONCLUSION UNDER AYE PP. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW PEOPLE WOULD HAVE THEIR I. P. P.'S A NAY SAY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT WE CAN'T SERVE YOU. THIS WOULD IN DOUBT AND WE THANK YOU FOR THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHELLE RODGERS I AM I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EARLY LEARNING INSTITUTE IN CINEMA COUNTY I AM ALSO THE CALIFORNIA'S AMBASSADOR TO THE CDC AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I APPRECIATE THE EXTRA MONEY GOING INTO THE BUDGET FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES I AM APPALLED THAT THE INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE COMPLETELY LEFT OUT. THAT RATE STUDY WHICH IS STILL IN PROGRESS HAS BEEN SENT BACK FOR A REVISED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE STUDY YOU CAN SEE THAT. THE INFANTS AND TODDLERS WERE LEFT TO THE VERY END WHEN WE TALKED WITH THE CONSULTANTS BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PART OF THE INFILL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION WHO IS SITTING ON THAT RATE COMMITTEE. THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR SYSTEM IS VERY COMPLICATED THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY DIDN'T GET VERY MUCH INPUT FOR IT. THE BASS LINE. OUR PRODUCTIVITY NUMBER THAT THEY'RE GIVING US TO USE IS TWENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE HOURS A WEEK. I RUN AND EARLY INTERVENTION AGENCY WITH HOME VISITTION FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY KIDS. I CAN TELL YOU IF I COULD GET MY STAFF TO BILL TWENTY SEVEN HOURS A WEEK THEY'D BE DOING IT. I'VE BEEN RUNNING THE EARLY INTERVENTION THE EARLY LEARNING INSTITUTE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. I KNOW THE BUDGET INSIDE AND OUT FOR EARLY INTERVENTION AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY TEACHERS. MAKE NINETEEN TO TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THEY HAVE MASTER'S DEGREES SO FOR SOMEONE TO SELL ME THAT WE ARE OVERPAID. I'M I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR NUMBERS WE HAVE SIX PT'S LEFT IN CINEMA COUNTY THAT WORK IN EARLY INTERVENTION WE HAVE. FOR SPEEDING SPECIALIST. I SENATOR BILLSAID IT'S OUR JOB TO FIND FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES AN EARLY START AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I A SIT ON A COMMITTEE THAT SAYS CALIFORNIA IS NOT FINDING THEIR CHILDREN. AND NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK AND TELL THEM NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT FINDING THEIR CHILDREN THEY'RE NOT FUNDING OUR THE SERVICES WHEN WE DO FIND THEM. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MY STAFF AND SAY THE PEOPLE DOWN THE STREET GET AN 8% INCREASE AND WE GET ZERO AND WE POSSIBLY GET NEGATIVE. SO WE KNOW THE STUDIES GOING TO BE RE DONE WE KNOW THE STUDY IS IN PROGRESS AND WILL COME BACK TO US IN SEPTEMBER WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THERE IS SOME. LEGISLATIVE EITHER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE OR PRESSURE ON DDS THAT SAYS UNTIL THAT -- BILL COMES BACK INTO THE RATE STUDY COMES BACK WE ARE INCLUDED. I'M OR WE ARE HELD OUT UNTIL IT COMES BACK WITH THE CORECT NUMBERS AND THEN WE ARE WILL BE INCLUDED IN JANUARY. BUT TO JUST LEAVE US OUT COMPLETELY FOR GOVERNOR WHO SAYS THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD AND INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE HIS PRIORITY IS REALLY UNCONSCIONABLE. SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN BE ABOUT THE BABIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- CARL LUNDEN HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES I WANT. TO START BY THINKING YOURSELF THINKING THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE PICKLE SAT MICKEY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES. FOR TAKING THE TIME TO REALLY GO OVER THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR. AND MAKE AN EXHAUSTIVE EFFORT AT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT. YEAH AND TO HELP FUND IT I REALLY WANT TO THANK. THE LEGISLATURE FOR JUMPING IN AND HELPING THE GOVERNOR FIND A COMPROMISE TO THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL WE PUT OUT WHICH ORIGINALLY ONLY FUNDED A FEW CATEGORIES OF SERVICES. IN THE SPACE AND INSTEAD NOW TAKES A MUCH MORE BROAD BASED APPROACH TO FUNDING -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR SUSPENDING THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE ISSUE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. CLEARLY ELIMINATED BUT A TWO YEAR SUSPENSION IS VERY HELPFUL. AND LAST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING LANGUAGE AT THE WILL BE OVERSIGHT. OF THE RATE STUDY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AROUND THE RATE STUDY OPTICALLY WANT TO THANK. CENTER STERN FOR HIS ROBUST LEADERSHIP AND PICKING UP THE TORCH OF HIS FORMER BOSS CENTER PAVLEY WHOSE -- APPARENT JUST LIKE I AM IN THE SYSTEM. WHEN I THINK CENTER STONE FOR HIS ADVOCACY CENTER GROVE FOR HER STALWART ADVOCACY -- CENTER HER TITLE FOR REALLY JUMPING IN AND SENATE BUDGET SUB THREE AND MAKING AN EXTRA EFFORT THERE TO HELP DIRECT THE SHIP THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THIS PROPOSAL STILL FALL SHORT AND WANT TO TELL YOU HOW AND THE FIRST THING I WOULD SAY IS WERE WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGING THE NEEDS OF THE SYSTEM. BUT WE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE INCREASES TOLD TILL JANUARY. ONE THAT THAT IS TO ME NOTHING MORE THAN A COST SAVINGS MEASURE WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE A HALF YEARS PAYMENTS TO YOU GUYS. WE THINK THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM THE RATE STUDY WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL AND AND JUST SUGGEST THAT WE NOT ALL FALL INTO THE TRAP. OF ALLOWING PEOPLE TO REFER TO THE RATE STUDY FOR THE CHANGES THEY PROPOSE BUT THEN NOT RECOGNIZING OTHER PIECES OF THE RATE STUDY AND THUS FAR THE RATE STUDY THAT'S OUT THERE. HAS RECEIVED PUBLIC COMMENT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S OUT WITH THOSE PUBLIC COMMENTS WITH THE RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE MANY OF THEM ARE METHODOLOGICAL COMMENTS FLAWS IN THE RATE STUDY THE ROOM POINTED OUT. IN THE WE'VE ASKED TO HAVE CHANGED AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONE FROM THE WOMAN YOU JUST -- FROM A SECOND AGO MAY BE AT A POINT WHERE WE RECEIVING NOTHING. IN THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE RATE STUDY SAYS THE SHOULDN'T YET PEOPLE ARE POINTING OUT FLAWS IN THE METHODOLOGY THAT WAS USED TO ARRIVE AT THAT. UNTIL THAT SETTLED WE THINK THAT'S OF WHAT STUDY OR AT LEAST AN INCOMPLETE STUDY ONE THING WE RECOMMEND YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER DOING BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF SESSION BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY FUNDING. TO THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE LEFT OUT IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS STILL FACE ALL THE RISING COST OF LIVING. THE FACT THAT MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO GO UP BY OVER 80% IN JANUARY ALL THE OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED LABOR -- INSURANCE TRANSPORTATION ALL THOSE COSTS ARE STILL GONNA FACES PROGRAMS THE TODAY OR OPEN THEIR LEGAL THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES THAT ARE IN SOMEBODY'S IPP SITTING IN A REGIONAL CENTER FILE SOMEWHERE. THERE BEEN APPROVED AND YET THEY'RE RECEIVING NO INCREASE IN OF THIS PROGRAM WE THINK IT A LOOK AT THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT IT WOULD BE A SKINNY PROPOSAL. TO GIVE THEM SOME SORT OF INCREASE TO SHOW GOOD FAITH. WE ALSO THINK YELL AT VERY SERIOUSLY AT TO THE POLICIES THAT ARE LEFT OVER FROM THE RECESSION ERA. THERE ARE TWO POLICIES IN PLACE ONE IT REQUIRES HALF THE BILLING PROCEDURES ACOSTA LOTTA HAVOC IN THE SYSTEM. THAT ISN'T THAT DATES BACK TO THE RECESSION IN THE STATE WE ARE NOT IN A RECESSION WHY ARE WE KEEPING IN A PLACE SECONDLY. SOCIAL WRECKING CAMP PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DE FUNDED SINCE THE RECESSION WE'RE NOT A RECESSION WHAT I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT. IS THAT HIS PEOPLE THE HAVE NOTS WORSE THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I HAVE A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD IS A KING UP THIS WEEK. BECAUSE I CAN AFFORD THAT BUT I HEARD TESTIMONY. IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE OF PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THAT AND THAT IS THE ONLY. OPPORTUNITY THOSE PEOPLE OUT FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION. WE CAN'T HAVE RECESSION ERA CUTS STAY IN PLACE FOR NO GOOD REASON OF THEM WE JUST WANT TO CHANGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS. FOR PRESS AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SPEECH LANGUAGE HEARING ASSOCIATION CASSIA -- I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAID BUT I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT THIS AT THE RESOURCES THAT WE PUT INTO THESE EARLY INTERVENTION. ZERO TO THREE HAS A SUBSTANTIAL COST SAVINGS TO THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM BECAUSE THOSE CHILDREN WHEN THEY MOVE FORWARD TO GET TO READ THREE YEARS OLD. INTO THE K. TOLL SYSTEM WITHOUT THOSE SERVICES AND I'M TOLD BY A SO PEAS PT'S -- TEASE OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THEY WILL BE CLOSING I'M IS NOT A THREAT IS A REALITY THEY WILL BE CLOSING.

TWELVE SYSTEM AS WELL THANK YOU.

MADAM CHAIR OF MAY I ASK FOR THE LA -- TO SPEAK TO THIS ITEM CERTAINLY. AND JUST TO CLARIFY THEIR THERE IN THE ROOM AND ALWAYS AVAILABLE THEY AREN'T AT THE DAIS -- BECAUSE AS THE PREVIOUS DELEO KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY TODAY'S FINAL NEGOTIATIONS SO -- ON THIS ONE I DO BELIEVE THEY HAVE A WHITE PAPER SO IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE ALEJO I DON'T HAVE IT IN MY MATERIAL CYCLE. THAT'S AWFUL. YOU KNOW THANKS FOR COMING THANKS FOR IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE SEE. IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE ALSO. BANKS ARE DESIGNED A BUSY DAY I UNDERSTAND I READ IT THIS WEEKEND. HELLO NICK SCHROEDER WITH THE LA -- AS AS YOU INDICATED WE DID RELEASE AN ANALYSIS OF MO YOU AS IS REQUIRED BY LAW -- WE HAVE TEN DAYS TO COMPLETE THE ANALYSIS -- AND IN THAT ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT -- THE PAY INCREASE IN PARTICULAR 3% PAY INCREASE IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY IS NOT A JUSTIFIED FROM AN ECONOMIC. BASIS MORE FROM RECRUITMENT NOR RETENTION BASIS -- AND THAT'S LARGELY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE LAST -- COMPENSATION STUDY THE MINISTRATION PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE WAS DONE IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN AND AT THAT TIME THE HOMES UNIT SIX WAS FOUND TO BE 40%. ABOVE MARKET ABOVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COUNTERPARTS -- AND SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN UNITS SIX SALARIES HAVE KEPT PACE OR EXCEEDED INFLATION -- AND JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN WILL RECEIVE A 5%. GENERAL SALARY INCREASE IN THE PROVIDED IN THE PROPOSEDAGREEMENT. AND SO CONSIDERING THAT WE THINK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A COMPENSATION STUDY SUBMITTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THEY ARE STILL COMPENSATED ABOVE MARKET. AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S JUSTIFIED. THANK YOU ON AND ARE YOU STILL EXPECTING THE COMPENSATION STUDY THAT. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ALTHOUGH THE STATE LAW REQUIRES THE MINISTRATION TO SUBMIT A COMPENSATION STUDY SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF ANIMAL YOU THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT BE SUBMITTING A COMPENSATION STUDY -- THIS YEAR. SO THEN WHAT'S OF WHAT'S THE PENALTY FOR NOT [inaudible] PROVIDING IT. IF IT'S DAYLIGHT. THERE'S NO EXPRESSED PENALTY OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM YOU'RE WELCOME HERE THANK YOU LA YOU.

RIGHT IS IF YOU CONTROL FOR COST OF LIVING WERE IN THE TOP TEN I THINK WE WERE THE SIXTH -- HIGHEST COMPENSATED EDITORS OF COMPARISON TO LIKE. SO YOU TAKE THE BIG COUNTIES. YEAH THAT WAS A BIG ORGANIZATIONS EARLY WOULD YOU COMPARE TO THOSE YEAH SO WHAT WE I MEAN WE LIKE I SAID WE ONLY HAVE TEN DAYS TO DO OUR ANALYSIS SO WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO A FULL COMPENSATION STUDY BUT WHAT WE DID DO IS LOOK AT JUST.
