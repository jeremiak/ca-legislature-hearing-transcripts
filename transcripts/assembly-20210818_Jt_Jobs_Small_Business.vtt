MONTHS AGO. WE KNOW THAT ATTICA

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:27.031

328% OF SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:40.304
LAOS BEGAN IN ABSOLUTELY

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:42.039
FOREVER MANY SMALL BUSINESSES

00:40:42.106 --> 00:40:44.708
AND COLLECTIVELY EMPLOY DECAL

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:47.111
COMPLEX I'M SORRY LET ME START

00:40:47.178 --> 00:40:49.146
OVER THAT COLLECTIVELY EMPLOY.

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:51.081
OVER SIX MILLION WORKERS

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:54.251
NATIONALLY. WHAT INSURED WAS AN

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:56.287
UNUSUALLY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT

00:40:56.353 --> 00:40:59.690
RATE. AND THAT PEAKED IN APRIL

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:02.693
OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY X.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.329
FOURTEEN POINT 8% THE HIGHEST

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:07.665
RATE OBSERVED SINCE DATA WAS

COLLECTED BEGINNING IN NINETEEN

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:12.803
FORTY EIGHT. NO THAT ISN'T

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.705
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:17.608
WE KNOW THAT TWO THIRDS OF ALL

THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES WERE

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:33.490
WOMEN AND OF THAT 40% WOMEN 70%

WERE WOMEN OF COLOR. EDIT

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:38.028
EMPLOYMENT IS LINKED TO THIS

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:41.131
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:43.067
TEND TO HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.536

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.941

TOOLS STIMULATING AGGRESSIVE

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:28.345
DEMAND OR PROVIDING LIQUIDITY

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:30.614

00:42:43.661 --> 00:42:45.362
IT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.031

NATIONAL PRODUCT SO THIS IS A

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:21.231
REALLY IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER AN

00:43:21.298 --> 00:43:23.467
ESSENTIAL FOR OUR ECONOMY. HERE

ONE MILLION BUSINESSES. AND

00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:37.047
THEY HAVE BEEN HIT HARD AND

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.615
THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED A REVENUE

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:45.255
DROP. IN THE MANAGER MAGNITUDE

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:48.759
OF 45% DURING THE PERIOD OF

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:52.129
JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:54.031
AND MAY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE.

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:57.167
WITH A THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.869
CLOSURE RATE DURING THE SAME

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:03.507
TIME. THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:07.845
RANKS ELEVENTH AMONG FIFTIES

00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:08.379
EIGHT STATE AT FORTY EIGHT

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:10.781
STATES. IN THE NATION NO

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:16.420
OVERALL CLOSER. MEANWHILE. THE

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.422
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.391
PARTICULARLY THE P. P. P. LONG

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:22.393
PROGRAM AVERAGED ABOUT THE SAME

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.528
PERCENTAGE OF VOLUME OF THE

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:26.597
PREVIOUS SB A LOANS TO THE

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:29.033
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:31.201
LAST THREE YEARS. THIS

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:33.070
EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR THE

00:44:33.137 --> 00:44:35.806
STATE LEVEL ACTION TO HELP WITH

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.441
THIS RECOVERY AND TO HELP SMALL

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:40.677
BUSINESSES. AS WE DIVE DOWN

00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:43.680
INTO THOSE NUMBERS. I DON'T

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:47.384
KNOW FOR A YEAR. WE WILL SEE

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:49.386
THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:55.692
AVERAGED ABOUT 528% OF SB A

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:57.661
LOANS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:59.630
AND THAT WAS THE SAME FOR THE

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:01.965
PPP PROGRAM. IF YOU LOOK AT

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:05.069
SPAGO FOR LOANS IF YOU LOOK AT

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:06.970
SEVEN A. LOANS. AND THEN YOU

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:09.807
LOOK AT THE P. P. P. LOANS

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:12.309
THERE WAS A LITTLE UP TICK IN

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.445
THE LATINO COMMUNITY. AS FAR AS

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:17.414
P. P. LOANS BUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.983
LOANS GIVEN TO THE- WERE

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.888
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. BASED ON

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:29.526
THIS DATA WE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE

00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:33.397
TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE-

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:35.165
REVENUES THAT WERE ACROSS THE

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:40.537
STATE. IF WE COULD GO TO THE

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:44.541
CHART WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE.

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:52.583
CLINTON. BASED ON THESE

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.351
INFORMATION BASED ON THE LACK

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:57.354
OF INFORMATION ABOUT LACK OF

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.623
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS WHICH

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:02.126
THE PPP PROGRAM PREDICATED

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:04.595
ITSELF ON BUSINESSES HAVING

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:05.762
RELATIONSHIPS WITH BANKS AND

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:08.432
MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND WOMEN

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:11.435
NOT HAVING THOSE SIGNIFICATIVA

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.904
LICENSES AS OTHERS THEY

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:16.807
DISPROPORTIONATELY GOT NOT ONLY

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:20.611
A LOWER AMOUNT. PERCENTAGE WISE

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:21.712
BUT THEY GOT A LOWER DOLLAR

00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:26.984
AMOUNT IN IN LOANS TO HELP. SO

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.686
WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT CAN THE

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.889
STATE LEGISLATOR WHAT CAN YOU

00:46:31.955 --> 00:46:35.159
DO TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.761
AND WHAT THESE COMMUNITY NEEDS

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.730
IN GOING FORWARD AND THERE'S

00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:41.899
THESE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:46:41.965 --> 00:46:44.368
BREAK DOWN THE INDUSTRIES THAT

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:47.137
THIS INVOLVED. BECAUSE THEY

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.540
WERE 90% OF THIS EMPLOYMENT OF

00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:52.142
SMALL BUSINESSES OKAY FROM

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:55.045
LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY. 67% OF

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:56.146
THE WORKERS EMPLOYED IN THIS

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:59.483
INDUSTRY ARE MINORITIES.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:01.985
INDUSTRIES IT THE INDUSTRY

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:05.822
EMPLOYS DECLINED 19% BETWEEN

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:09.159
JANUARY. TWO THOUSAND TEN

00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:12.129
TWENTY AND ENGINE TWENTY ONE.

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:14.298
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT WHEN WE

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.799
LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:17.367
PROFESSIONAL AND BUSINESS

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:20.938
SERVICES INDUSTRY 81% OF

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:21.505
EMPLOYMENT COMES FROM SMALL

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:25.509
BUSINESSES AND 49% OF THE

00:47:25.576 --> 00:47:27.144
WORKERS IN THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:30.581
MINORITIES. THE INDUSTRY

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:32.549
EMPLOYMENT DECLINE ALL LESS

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:36.119
THAN 1% IN BETWEEN THE SAME

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:38.422
PERIOD OF JANUARY TWENTIETH AND

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:43.293
JANUARY AND JUNE. TWENTY ONE.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.698
SO THERE ARE THREE THINGS THAT

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:50.734
I BELIEVE ARE LOW HANGING FRUIT

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:52.970
WITHIN THE REACH OF THIS

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:57.341
ASSEMBLY. THAT CAN BE DONE

00:47:57.407 --> 00:48:00.410
BECAUSE WE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:48:00.477 --> 00:48:04.248
REALLY HAVE DONE A LOT TO

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:05.716
ASSIST SMALL BUSINESSES AND I

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.517
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DISCREDIT

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:10.220
THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

00:48:10.287 --> 00:48:12.589
WE HAVE IN PLACE AND WHAT WE

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:16.493
CAN IMPROVE ON. N. THE NUMBER

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.728
ONE THING I THINK WE CAN DO IS

00:48:17.794 --> 00:48:21.498
USE TECHNOLOGY. WE CAN MAP

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.300
ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO SMALL

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:26.270
BUSINESSES COLLECTED DATA

00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:28.739
ORGANIZE A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE

00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:32.075
DATABASE AND MAINTAIN A WEBSITE

00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:34.111
WHICH COULD BE EITHER DONE BY A

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:36.113
GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR THIRD

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:39.516
PARTY- INDEPENDENT- GROUP OF

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:42.052
CONTRACTORS THIS WILL BE TO

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:44.021
PROVIDE READY AND CURRENT

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:47.357
INFORMATION ON WHERE AVAILABLE

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.493
CAPITAL IS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:53.063
AND RELATED CONTACT INFORMATION

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.965
TO CONNECT THEM TO THE BANKERS

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:56.667
AND LENDERS AND FINANCIAL

00:48:56.733 --> 00:49:00.037
INSTITUTIONS IT. WITHIN THEIR

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:03.407
EXIT OUT. THE SECOND THING WE

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:06.443
COULD DO IS WE CAN PROVIDE

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.378
REFUNDABLE RESEARCH AND

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.113
DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS FOR

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:12.082
SMALL BUSINESSES AND START UP.

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.984
SOME SMALL BUSINESSES CAN'T

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:16.853
UTILIZED EXISTING R&amp;D TAX

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.890
CREDIT BECAUSE THEY FACE LITTLE

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:22.526
TO NO TAX BURDEN. PARTICULARLY

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:24.628
START UPS AND THE PRE REVENUE

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:29.166
STAGE. TARGETING POLICIES TO.

00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:31.802
REFINE A PERCENTAGE OF THAT I'M

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:35.305
USED RESEARCH CREDIT. COULD

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.407
FACILITATE GREATER INVESTMENT

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.542
WITH THE POTENTIAL OF

00:49:38.608 --> 00:49:42.679
GENERATING FUTURE REVENUES. THE

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:46.216
THIRD. RECOMMENDATION IS TO

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:48.218
ENHANCE THE SMALL BUSINESS

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:51.355
UTILIZATION PROGRAM. ELEVATE

00:49:51.421 --> 00:49:53.390

WHICH IS LOW HANGING FRUIT IS

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:52.682
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

BE ABLE IMPLEMENTED AT THE

ACTIONS EITHER THE LEGISLATURE

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:45.721
OR THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TAKE

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.989
TO REALLY MITIGATE THE

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:50.292

MAPPING OF CAPITAL FOR SMALL

BUSINESSES IS KEY BECAUSE IT

01:09:08.043 --> 01:09:10.312

HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ACCESS

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:18.440

QUALIFY FOR TRADITIONAL

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:23.545

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.504
LETTERS THAT UP. THAT WAS

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.940

COST PER BUSINESS SERVICE

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:21.109
TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS SO

01:16:21.176 --> 01:16:22.711
YOU CAN DO THE MATH TO SEE HOW

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:43.999
THE FEDERALLY DESIGNATED

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:47.069

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.437
MATCHING THAT MONEY THEY'RE

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:49.838
GETTING FROM THE STATE AND THEN

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:51.106

DURING A REMOTE ACADEMIC

01:50:33.893 --> 01:50:36.262
SUPPORT WAS JUST- IT DIDN'T

01:50:36.329 --> 01:50:38.264
THAT WAS THE LEAST EFFECTIVE

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:41.968
MEANS SO. WE REALLY DID HAVE-

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:44.504
YOU KNOW JUST TO GIVE YOU AN

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:45.472

LOANS- GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE

01:50:57.984 --> 01:50:59.919
DEMOCRATS NEED TO EDIT BUT THE

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:03.890
REALITY WAS THAT- IT REALLY

01:51:03.957 --> 01:51:06.960
COVERED ONE MONTH RIGHT FOR US.

01:51:07.027 --> 01:51:08.962
AND SO ARE A LOT OF SLEEPLESS

01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:14.100
NIGHTS- ARE THAT WAS JERRY-

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:16.569
THERE WAS A LACK OF RESOURCES

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.338
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT WE

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:20.607
COULD HAVE REALLY TAPPED INTO

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:24.878
NOT JEFF BARNES. BUT PROGRAMS

01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:30.417
IN WHICH- AT WORK CALL FIGHT TO

01:51:30.483 --> 01:51:33.620
OBTAIN. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:36.956
IS THE FEDERAL- WORK PROGRAMS

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:39.192
THAT WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:41.594
ABLE TO TAP INTO- AND BE ABLE

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.797
TO HIRE STUDENTS AT THE LOCAL

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:47.267
UNIVERSITIES- TO HELP US. AND

01:51:47.333 --> 01:51:49.202
THAT THAT YOU KNOW OF COURSE

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:51.304
THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO US

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:55.141
TO- THOSE FUNDS FOR DESIGNATED

01:51:55.208 --> 01:52:03.616
FOR. ON CAMPUS. JOBS I. SO WE-

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.251
BUT A GREAT DEAL WE OPENED UP

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:07.020
OUR DOORS A BIT MORE TO HOME

01:52:07.087 --> 01:52:09.589
SCHOOL FAMILIES- BUT THE

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:11.591
REALITY BE BEHIND THAT IS THAT

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:12.926
THERE WAS SOME RESTRICTIONS

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:17.464
THERE TO- BUT I THINK FOR BRASS

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:21.067
HURRIEDLY CAPITAL CONTINUES TO

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:23.903
BE A STRUGGLE- STAFFING IS A

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:26.940
HUGE- CHALLENGE FOR US RIGHT

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:30.910
NOW. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HIRE

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:34.647
THE- PEOPLE THAT WE TYPICALLY

01:52:34.714 --> 01:52:38.418
HIGHER- RIGHT NOW THE LABOR

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:41.921
COST IS GONNA. SO EVERYTHING IN

01:52:41.988 --> 01:52:44.424
RELATIONS TO LABOR HAS GONE OUT

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:46.526
FOR US WORKERS COMP INSURANCE

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:51.464
IS GONNA- WE ARE STRUGGLING

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:53.967
RIGHT NOW WHERE NOW MOST

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:55.268
FAMILIES ARE GOING BACK TO

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:59.706
SCHOOL- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:02.942
TO. TAP INTO THAT MARKET BUT IT

01:53:03.009 --> 01:53:05.545
CAN ARM WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:06.412
ITSELF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE

01:53:06.479 --> 01:53:08.148

EIGHT EIGHT AND WE DID IT

01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:17.717

02:00:15.141 --> 02:00:18.110
LOT OF- REDUCTION IN THIS IS

02:00:18.177 --> 02:00:20.279

02:00:22.214 --> 02:00:24.116
SUSTAINABILITY. WE DON'T WANT

02:00:24.183 --> 02:00:25.551
TO SEE OUR SORT OF CULTURAL

02:00:25.618 --> 02:00:28.020
CENTERS GO AWAY. SO WE REALLY

02:00:28.087 --> 02:00:30.089
