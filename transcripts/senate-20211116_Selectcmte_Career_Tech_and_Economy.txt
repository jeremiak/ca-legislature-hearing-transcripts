THIS SELECT COMMITTEE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS HOW WE MEASURE SUCCESS. AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE MAY IMPROVE ON CURRENT EFFORTS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. THAT WORK FORCE TRAINING DOLLARS ARE GETTING PEOPLE INTO GOOD JOBS. AND ON A PATH OF CAREER ADVANCEMENT. THE TIMING FOR THIS HEARING FRANKLY IS PRESCIENT THE RECENT PANDEMIC HAS CREATED UNPRECEDENTED CHANGES TO THE WORK FORCE FROM EMPLOYEES EITHER RETIRING EARLY. OR JUST LEAVING THE WORK FORCE TO REMOTE WORK LIFESTYLES. BUT THE FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY THE PRESIDENT HAS JUST SIGNED THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT BILL IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY. ON THE HEELS OF GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR CALIFORNIA COMEBACK PLAN AS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STATE BUDGET. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT REQUIRED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES THAT ARE TRAINED AND CAPABLE OF DESIGNING BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THE PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORKFORCE AND CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THIS STATE MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS. PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SKILLS NECESSARY. TO KEEP CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE. YET WITH ALL THIS OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENT. AN INVESTMENT THE NEWS ON THE EMPLOYMENT FRONT IS MIXED. WHILE THE STATE HAS ONE POINT ONE MILLION JOB OPENINGS AS OF AUGUST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THERE ARE OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. UNEMPLOYED. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS DISCONNECT. FRANKLY MAY BE THAT THE JOBS THAT THE UNEMPLOYED OR SEEKING AND THE TRAINING REQUIRED FOR SUCH POSITIONS DO NOT MATCH. PERHAPS WE'RE SPENDING MONEY TRAINING PEOPLE FOR JOBS THAT DO NOT EXIST AT LEAST IN SOME REGIONS OF THE STATE. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN HIS ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF EMPLOYERS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING FLEXIBLE PATHWAYS INTO GOOD JOBS. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY. EXCLUDED FROM THE ECONOMIC SUCCESSES OF THE STATE. WE ALL MUST COMMIT TO CREATE A HIGHLY SKILLED HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WORKFORCE ENSURING THAT WE CAN MEET THE DEMAND OF EMPLOYERS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WHILE ALSO PROVIDING WORKERS WITH MARKETABLE SKILLS THAT FACILITATE ACCESS TO GOOD PAYING LIVING WAGE JOBS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. TO DO THIS WE NEED TO ENSURE THE POLICY MAKERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST RELEVANT AND ACCURATE DATA. TO ASSESS WHETHER CURRENT TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE MEETING EMPLOYER DEMAND WHILE ALSO GETTING JOB TRAINING PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS INTO THE JOBS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE TRAINED. CURRENTLY THE STATE DOES NOT SYSTEMATICALLY MEASURE WHETHER WORKERS ARE OBTAINING JOBS IN THE OCCUPATIONS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE TRAINED. AND JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS DON'T TRACK WORKERS INTO THE LABOR MARKET FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD FOLLOWING PROGRAM PARTICIPATION TO DETERMINE IF JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE POSITIONING WORKERS ON A PATH OF UPWARD MOBILITY. WE NEED TO FIX THIS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE JOB TRAINING AND EQUIVALENT JOB AVAILABLE THESE LINES ACTUALLY CROSS. WE NEED TO GIVE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE LOOKING TO UPSKILL THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE TRAINING THEY WILL RECEIVE. WELL FOR THE MILITANT WAGE COMPETITIVE ADVANCEMENT AND THE ABILITY TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT IN THEIR LOCAL AREA. I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANELISTS IN THE PUBLIC TODAY. AND ENGAGING IN ROBUST DISCUSSIONS. ON HOW WE CAN BEST MOVE FORWARD ON THIS VERY VERY CRITICAL ISSUE. SO LET'S START WITH OUR PANELISTS TODAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ONE OF THE TIME OUR PANELISTS BUT THE CURRENT PANEL THE FIRST PANEL IS ON CURRENT PERFORMANCE REPORTING DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION METHODS OVERVIEW IN OUR FIRST PANELIST MISTER TIM RAINEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US SIR ABSOLUTELY MY PLEASURE THANK YOU SENATOR ROSS- I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF- IT YOUR OPENING COMMENTS WERE FOR TRAFFIC AND I WANTED TO TRY TO- KIND OF BUILD ON ON WHAT YOU SAID AND MAYBE EVEN PUT A CHALLENGE OUT- I'M- GETTING DEEP INTO THE DATA A CONVERSATION. IS HANDLED BY THE SMART PEOPLE YOU PUT ON THIS PANEL WITH ME FRANKLY- I. VERY SMART PEOPLE ON BOTH PANELS SAVE FOR ME- SAW IT AGAIN I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF- BUT THE REAL QUICKLY THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD IS PRIMARILY A POLICY BODY- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WORK FORCE WHAT WE ADVISE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. ALL THINGS WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT. WERE MADE UP OF BUSINESS AND LABOR- AND STATE AGENCIES THAT OVERSEE AND ADMINISTER THE STATE'S WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN FACT- CENTER TYPE GYROS US ON THIS COMMITTEE SELECT COMMITTEE IS ON THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD- WHAT SIZE I SHOULD PRIMARILY A POLICY ENTITY HOWEVER. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE TAKEN ON MORE OF A PROGRAM ROLE- INVESTING IN DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT WOULD HELP INFORM POLICY BUT ALSO DRIVE POLICY- SO WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF DEVELOPED THIS I THINK DO TANK- KIND OF APPROACH. TO THE WORK WHERE WE'RE INVESTING TO DRIVE A SYSTEM CHANGE BUT WE'RE ALSO LEARNING FROM THOSE INVESTMENTS. IN WAYS THAT INFORM POLICY I'M- SORRY I THE CHALLENGE. THAT I WANTED TO PUT FORWARD REALLY. QUICKLY IS. A MY- THE COME UP FROM LOOKING AT THE PROGRAM DATA AND THE WAY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ANALYZE AND DO A VALUATION WHAT. IS IT ISN'T THIS THE SYSTEM ITSELF NEEDS TO BE RE EVALUATED REEVALUATE- THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH. TO FIX. THAT FOCUSES ON INDIVIDUALS AND THE HOPE THAT. PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS- ARE COMPETITIVE ENOUGH TO LAND A JOB. THIS IS THE KIND OF WAY THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM WORKS IT GIVES PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK. WILL MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE IN IN IN LABOR MARKETS WE SORT OF PUSH THEM OUT AND HOPE THEY LAND. A LOT OF FOLKS CALL THAT TRAINING PRAY. YOU MENTION THAT- GRACE THE QUESTION ARE WE TRAINING PEOPLE FOR JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST. ARE WE DOING RIGHT BY THESE TRAINEES. AND I WOULD SAY IN THE MICRO SENSE. IT DOES WORK TO GIVE AN INDIVIDUAL A LEG UP IN COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKETS IN THE COMPETITION FOR A QUALITY JOB. BUT IN THE MACRO SENSE IT IT IT DOESN'T HOLD UP AS WELL- BECAUSE WE'RE BUILDING COMPETITION FOR TOO FEW GOOD JOBS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN WE DO THAT THERE'S A DOWNWARD PRESSURE. OR EFFECT ON WAGES. AND THEY WERE VERY. VERY REAL HISTORICAL IMPACTS OF PRIVILEGE AND RACE AND GENDER ON WHO AND WHAT GROUPS WENT OUT THAT SORT OF COMPETITION. SO IN THIS WAY IF OUR IF OUR END GAME IS EQUITY. IT'S NOT SET UP FOR US TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE ON EQUITY ACROSS THE ST REGIS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT WE'RE THINKING OF THE STATE WORKFORCE BOARD IS REALLY TURNING THIS TRADITIONAL APPROACH ON ITS HEAD. SO IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL SERVICES. THE WORK FOR SYSTEM SHOULD ALSO BE WORKING TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS. TO PULL PEOPLE INTO GOOD JOBS TO SUPPORT REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY AS YOU POINTED OUT WITH A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE- TYPE TRAINING SERVICES DIRECTLY TO THE CREATION OF GOOD JOBS. AND THEN FINALLY TO IMPROVE EXISTING JOBS. WE HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYERS OUT. ASKING AND REACHING OUT EVEN TO A WORKFORCE BOARDS AND OTHER FOLKS- LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ATTRACT RETAIN RETAIN OUT WORKERS INJURED REDUCED TURNOVER. SO IT'S A REALLY GREAT TIME TO BE TALKING TO EMPLOYERS BECAUSE OUR OPEN TO THIS ABOUT JOB QUALITY HAD IMPROVED THAT TO GET A TEASE. AT THESE PRIORITIES- WE HAVE THIS THING THAT WE'RE DRIVING AT THE STATE WORKFORCE BILLBOARD CALLED THE HIGH ROAD AGENDA. I DON'T PRIORITIZE ECONOMIC EQUITY JOB QUALITY AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE. AND THAT APPROACH STARTS WITH DEEP INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT- AND. THE RELATED WORK IS SYSTEM ALIGNMENT. REGIONALLY IN. IN IN A- STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF. THE BASE ORGANIZATIONS. TO CONNECT MORE WORKERS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THOSE. BEEN LOCKED OUT OF PROSPERITY FOR GENERATIONS. TO PATHWAYS TO QUALITY JOBS- AND- THIS RAISES A- QUESTION OR CHALLENGE WITH DATA COLLECTION- BECAUSE- BY THE WAY WE COLLECT PARTICIPANT DATA OR PARTICIPANT DATA. DOESN'T GET ANY OF THIS WORK- AND YOU GET WHAT YOU MEASURE SO WHAT YOU MEASURE- ACTUALLY DRIVES A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES IN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE WORK FORCE SYSTEM SO FOR NOT MEASURING AND TRACKING. THESE MORE INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT LOCAL BOARDS IN COLLEGES ENGAGING REGIONALLY WITH INDUSTRY AND LABOR- THEY WERE NOT GOING TO GET THE ENERGY PLACED IN IN THOSE AREAS- SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE THAT I THINK DOESN'T GET A DRESS WITH A PURCHASE PARTICIPANT DATA. OUCH I THINK I'LL STOP THERE I CENTERED AROUND BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS TOO. BUT YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM AND ALL KIND OF WAIT IN THE WINGS UNLESS YOU'VE GOT. OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME. WELL LET ME JUST- MAYBE ASK A QUESTION OR MAKE A COMMENT OR MAYBE DO BOTH. YOU KNOW ONE OF MY CONCERNS WAS THAT. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION AS TO THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF JOBS FOR WHICH THEY'RE OPENINGS AND FOR WHICH EMPLOYERS. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NEED EMPLOYEES IN PARTICULAR REGIONS. AND IF TRUE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK IT'S STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL. CLASSIFICATIONS ARE SOME OF THE OTHER REPORTS. PARTICULARLY DOWN IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE I COME FROM AND THEY SAID WELL WE NEED THREE THOUSAND. WAREHOUSE WORKERS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THAT A FORKLIFT OPERATOR IS AT A COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY CLERK. AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT THE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR EACH OF THOSE WOULD VERY SIGNIFICANTLY ONE FROM THE OTHER. SO IN ORDER TO DESIGN THE TRAINING PROGRAMS WHETHER YOU'RE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUSINESS OR- THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME. GRANULARITY AS TO WHAT THE NATURE OF THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE JOB IS IN THE- SKILLS THAT ARE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEED RIGHT. AND SO WHEN I RISK FOLKS. IN GOVERNMENT IN OUT- IF I NEEDED TO BE FILLED. TWENTY FIVE- COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY CLERKS POSITIONS THAT I HAVE WHO WOULD I CALL. AND WHERE WOULD I GO TO THE LODGE THIS DATA AND IF I TURN TO THE EDUCATORS AND I SAID WHERE WOULD YOU GO TO FIND OUT IF SOMEONE NEEDS COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY CLERKS AND THE ANSWER IS WE DON'T KNOW. OR THERE ISN'T ANYBODY. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE NATURE OF. PIECE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE OTHER PIECE OF THE PROBLEM IS THE DATA COLLECTION SIMPLY FIGURING OUT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS THAT SOMEBODY IS EARNED WE NEED OCCUPATION WE NEED WAGE RATE WE NEED JOB LOCATION SO WE CAN SOMEHOW AND PERHAPS MORE. IN AN ENHANCED. LABOR MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEMS SO WE CAN PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER AND SO OUR EDUCATORS KNOW WHO TO TRAIN AND WHAT TO TRAIN THE MEN DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT RATHER LONG COMMENT THAT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A QUESTION MARK AT THE END. I THINK IT WAS A TERRIFIC COMIC NIGHT AND I AGREE COMPLETELY I DO TOO TWO ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS SO THAT IS. WHAT WE COULD USE MORE CORRECT GRANULAR- THAT DATA ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REGIONAL LABOR MARKETS OUT AND I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE ON THE- THE OTHER PANEL- COULD COULD ADDRESS THAT. THE WAY WE'VE BEEN GETTING AT IT IS THIS BUILDING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY ON THE GRASS RIGHT THAT USING THE DATA THE LABOR MARKET DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRENDS ARE. I WANT A LONG TERM PROJECTIONS ARE SO WE UNDERSTAND WHICH INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE REALLY DRIVING EMPLOYMENT- BUT THEN NOT RELYING ON THE DATA MUCH PAST THAT POINT- INSTEAD ENGAGING EMPLOYERS IN THE SECTOR SO THEY WERE HAVING CONVERSATIONS. AND COKE PLANNING WITH THEM ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE OVER THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS. AND IN RESPONDING TO THIS NEED SO THERE'S I THINK WE WANT WHENEVER WE COULD HAVE BETTER DATA BUT WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET AWAY FROM THE VALUE. OF THAT DIRECT CONNECTION WITH INDUSTRY BECAUSE THAT REAL TIME DATA IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE- WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE A WORK FOR SYSTEM WORK ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER AND JOB SEEKER. AND I THINK ON THE ON THE PERFORMANCE SIDE IN TERMS OF. OUTCOMES I AGREE WITH YOU THERE TOO I THINK WE NEED MORE GRANULAR DATA THE WAY WE. COLLECTED WE FIRST USED. YOU SCALIGER- TO COLLECT PARTICIPANT DATA- AND THAT GIVES US- SOME OF WHAT WE NOT NOT NOT ALL. THEN WE RELY ON. SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY REPORTS FROM OUR PROJECTS IN FROM EMPLOYERS- TO TELL US WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE GROUND TO GET US. A CLEAR SENSE OF WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING SO WE CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS ON THE ALONG THE WAY. AND THEN WE DO THIRD PARTY EVALUATIONS OF OUR PROBLEM OUR PROJECT WORK. BUT THAT THOSE LAST TWO- WAYS OF GETTING AT IT. THE CALL COLLECTING A SUPPLEMENTAL QUARTERLY REPORTS PUTS AN ONUS ON EMPLOYERS AND THE PROJECTS. TO BE COSTLY PROVIDING US NARRATIVE REPORTS WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING- AND THEN THE THIRD PARTY EVALUATION WORK IS. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT CHEAP EVEN THOUGH WE WORK WITH THE UC SYSTEM- WHICH GIVES US A GREAT VALUE- AND SOME OTHER ORGANIZATIONS DID YOU REALLY TERRIFIC WORK. IT IT IT IS. WHAT WE USED TO GET WHAT WE NEED AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE- ASKING OF THE OTHER PANELISTS JUST GIVE YOU SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN. AUTOMATE THAT. RIGHT AND GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE DREADED JOB TRAINING PIPELINE AND I THINK YOU WOULD. AGREE THAT IS NOT INSUBSTANTIAL- IN FACT IT'S FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AS IT SHOULD BE. EVEN MORE SO NOW DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND AS WE MOVE HOPEFULLY INTO THE POST PANDEMIC ERA. ARE YOU ABLE IS THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD STRUCTURE AND SYSTEM. ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT PERCENTAGE. OF PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH OUR TRAINING PIPELINE. ACTUALLY SECURE A JOB IN THE FIELD FOR WHICH THEY RECEIVE TRAINING. NOT NOT AUTOMATICALLY THE WAY THAT WE GET IT THAT IS TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS- THAT COME FROM OUR OUR PROJECTS WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME- COMMUNICATING WITH PROJECTS DOING COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE AND THAT SORT OF THING VERY HANDS ON- BUT NO THERE'S NO I KNOW WHATYOU'RE ASKING AND I DON'T THERE'S NO AUTOMATED WAY TO GET THAT DATA- DO WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S 50% I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I'M JUST. TRYING TO BRING THE PROBLEM. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S 50% OF THOSE WHO WERE TRAINED AT SECURE EMPLOYMENT IN THE FIELDS WHICH ARE TRAINED OR WHETHER IT'S 70% OR- EIGHTY WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY I GUESS THAT WE COULD TAKE. TO THE BANK SO TO SPEAK. WE CAN TELL YOU THAT- WE CAN TELL YOU- BY LOOKING AT THE DATA COMES FROM CAL JOBS AND COMPARING IT AGAINST THE BASE WAGE FILE- AND WE CAN LOOK AT- PRE. PRE PLACEMENT DATA. PRE PROGRAMMED DATA RATHER AND THEN POST OP PROGRAM DATA AND WE CAN LOOK AT QUARTERS OUT- AND TELL YOU- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE TRAINEES. ACTUALLY GOT EMPLOYMENT WE CAN TELL YOU THEIR WAGES- BUT WE CAN'T TELL YOU IS WHAT SPECIFICALLY- THAT JOB IS OR WHAT THAT OCCUPATION IS- AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT MAYBE THAT THE- OTHER FOLKS ON THE CALL CAN ADDRESS. BUT THE OTHER THING WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT- THE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS THAT TRAINING. IS IT COMPARED TO OTHER KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS OR SERVICES TRAINING AT. GET YOU. A LOT GREATER OUTCOME IN TERMS OF JOB PLACEMENT AND QUALITY JOB PLACEMENT THEN YOU THEN YOU. OTHERWISE WOULD WITHOUT TRAINING. AND I THINK IT'S- IT MAY BE TALKING TO ADDRESS THIS R. CAL SKILLS WORK. THAT WAS ANALYZED BY DO YOU SEE POLICY LAB FOUND THAT. AS MUCH AS OTHER PEOPLE WENT TO TRAINING AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T. BOB I THINK THAT TRAINING WAS ALWAYS WRAPPED WITH OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES. I'M SURE I'M JUST CONCERNED. FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T KNOW. IF THE DENTAL HYGIENIST WHO WENT THROUGH. ONE OF OUR JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN AN AREA THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE A LOT OF DENTAL HYGIENISTS. WOUND UP AT STARBUCKS. WITH THE WAGES THEY'RE NOW PAYING IN THE BENEFITS WE CAN'T REALLY TELL WHETHER THERE'S ANY REASONABLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TRAINING THAT THE INDIVIDUAL RECEIVED AND THE JOB SKILLS THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PERFORMING ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THE PAY OR THE PAY RATE SEEMS TO BE ABOUT RIGHT FOR THE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT THEY WENT THROUGH THAT. FIRST STATEMENT YEAH THAT'S THAT THEY'RE NOT- AND I EXPECT THINK THAT I MEAN THERE IS THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE WE GAIN FROM THE DATA ON WHAT SECTORS- PEOPLE WENT TO WORK AND- BUT I THINK YOU IT DOESN'T GET TO THE LEVEL OF GRANULARITY THAT THAT THAT THAT I THINK THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT. WELL I'VE LISTENED I DON'T WANT ANYBODYSUGGEST TO YOU ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY I COMPLETELY. IN AWE OF WHAT YOU WILL DO AND THE HARD WORK THAT YOU IN THE REGIONAL BOARDS AROUND THE STATE INCLUDING MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO SIT ON THEM- PERFORM EACH AND EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR FOR ALL THE REST OF US TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED AND GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK YOU NEED TO BE BACK TO WORK SO THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY OUR NEXT PANELIST IS- NICOLE LIKE TURKISH DEPUTY CHIEF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTABILITY SECTION WORK FOR SERVICES BRANCH EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THAT'S A MOUTHFUL. WELCOME THANK YOU SENATOR YES THAT IS A MOUSE ALL. SO IN REGARDS TO- HOW WE REPORT OUR PERFORMANCE FILL OUR WORKER SERVICES BRANCH WITHIN EDG WILL OVERSEE VARIOUS DIFFERENT WORKFORCE PROGRAMS MOSTLY UNDER THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY AFTER WE GO UP- WE CAPTURE REPORT AND MEASURE OUR PROGRAM PERFORMANCE BASED ON THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THERE IS A FINE- IMMERSIVE PROGRAM PRESENTS ARE FIVE- PERFORMANCE MEASURES ABOUT ALL ARE WHAT WE ARE CONTINUALLY REPORTING AND BEING MEASURED AGAINST. THE FIRST ONE IS EMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AFTER EXIT SO IT'S LOOKING OUT OF THOSE THAT FINISH OUR PROGRAM HOW MANY OF THEM ARE EMPLOYED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AFTER THE ACCIDENT FROM A PROGRAM WE ALSO LOOK AT EMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AFTER EXIT WHICH AGAIN AFTER THEY FINISH OUR- PROGRAM ARE THEY EMPLOYED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AFTER THEY'VE EXITED THAT PROGRAM. WE ALSO LOOK AT MEDIAN EARNINGS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AFTER EXIT SO ALL OF THOSE THAT FINISHED HER PROGRAM WHAT IS THE MEDIAN EARNING OF THOSE THAT DID HAVE A JOB IN THE SECOND QUARTER- AND THEN WE ALSO FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN TRAINING OR EDUCATION WE LOOK AT CREDENTIAL ATTAINMENT SO THOSE THAT RESPOND TO TRAINING HOME YOU'RE ACTUALLY OBTAINING A CREDENTIAL AND THEN WE ALSO LOOK AT MEASURABLE SKILL GAMES WHICH IS REALLY JUST MEASURING IF YOUR EDUCATION OR TRAINING ARE YOU MAKING THAT DOCUMENTED PROGRESS. TOWARDS GAINING SKILLS TECHNICAL SKILLS OCCUPATIONAL SKILLS. NEEDED- FOR THE OCCUPATION. SO WE NEGOTIATE FOR FIVE MEASURES FOR THE TO THE PARTICIPANTS BEING TO GO. WHAT THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. AND IS LIVE ANIMAL- PERFORMANCE GOALS EXCUSE ME FOR EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT MEASURES. THAT INDICATE WHAT KIND OF OUR EXPECTATION AS WE ARE PROGRAMMED FOR HER SISTER I'M SO IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A 100% EMPLOYMENT- BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE SERVING THOSE. ARE THE HARD TO HAVE THE OST OF. YOURS THINGS LIKE THAT AND STILL ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE BASED ON WHO WERE ACTUALLY SERVING THAT DEMOGRAPHIC. AS WELL AS THE- LOCAL ECONOMIES THE STATE ECONOMY DEAL LOOKS AT THAT AND DETERMINE TO WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE. OVER EACH OF OUR PROGRAMS AND FOR EACH OF THOSE FIVE MEASURES WE CAN'T NEGOTIATE WHAT OUR RATES SHOULD BE. AND WE ROUTINELY MEET OR EXCEED AT THOSE RATES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- WE REPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ARE FINAL AND ANNUAL REPORTS AND THEN WE'LL EVALUATE ARE WE ACTUALLY NEEDING- OR EXCEEDED OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS- AND WE GENERALLY ARE. FOR KNOX AND THEN WE THAT'S WHERE WE KIND OF INTERVENE AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY OF. OUR LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AREAS. IN REGARDS TO INCOME MOBILITY- AND WHETHER TO PRO BUT ARE GETTING JOB AND ALL. VIRTUALLY TRAIN FOR- OUR INCOME MOBILITY IT REALLY WE CAN LOOK AT THE MEDIAN EARNINGS. TO SENIOR IF THERE ISN'T AN EARNINGSINCREASE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SPECIFICALLY- WERE SPECIFICALLY MEASURED OPTION BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO. A TRAINING PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS GETTING JOBS IN OCCUPATIONS THAT THEY TRAIN FOR THE TEN MENTIONED THAT'S A LITTLE BIT ALREADY- WE DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY GET INFORMATION- ON OCCUPATIONAL CODES HOWEVER- STUFF CAN FOLLOW UP WITH OUR WORKFORCE FOUND LOCAL WORKER LOCAL WORK FORCE KNOWN AREA STAFF. CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THE INDIVIDUALS AND ENTER THAT DATA INTO OUR SYSTEM SO THEY CANNOT- TALK TO THEM FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE EMPLOYED AT WHAT OCCUPATION IS. AND THEY ENTER IT INTO OUR CULTURAL. SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT. I'M SO WE DO THAT YOU CAN ALSO KIND OF A LOW TO THAT WE DO GET INFORMATION ON THE FACTORS SO WE ALSO WILL NO INDUSTRY. WE KNOW THAT LIMITED YOU CAN'T ALWAYS DRAW CONCLUSIONS BASED ON INDUSTRY- BUT WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY AVAILABLE AS WELL. SH IN REGARDS TO ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING PLACED INTO JOBS THAT PROVIDE GOOD BEIJING. THE MAJORITY OF THE TRAINING FUNDS THAT WE UTILIZE FOR OUR PROGRAMS THE REQUIRED TO USE SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED THE CALIFORNIA ELIGIBLE TRAINING PROVIDER LIST WHICH IS A DEPARTMENT OF LABOR REQUIRED- LIST UNDER THE WE OWE OUR REGULATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA AND RULES AROUND WHAT A TRAINING PROVIDER NEEDS TO DO TO BE ABLE TO BE ON THAT LIST. SO THAT HOPEFULLY THAT IS BLESSED- BUT WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING ALL THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINING PROVIDERS AND PROGRAMS ON THAT LIST AND WE'VE ADDED ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE ABOUT THE PROVIDERS ON THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON THAT LIST REALLY ARE QUALITY AND SO THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS NOT WE EXPECT PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. AND IF THEY FALL BELOW THOSE EXPECTATIONS AND THEY NO LONGER ARE ALLOWED TO BE ON THE LIST- IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE IN IN DEMAND INDUSTRIES IN THE STATE OR THE LOCAL AREA WHERE IT'S BEING OFFERED TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING INTO THOSE PROGRAMS IN THOSE TRAINING RUNS THAT WE'RE INVESTING. ARE GOING TO SUPPORT AND DEMAND INDUSTRIES AND ARE WITH PROGRAMS I HAVE A RECORD. OF THAT PERFORMANCE. SH AND THEN IT REGARDS TO THE I THINK IS THE OUR PROGRAM I THINK. WE ARE ROUTINELY MEET OR EXCEED OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE SET UP BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR- AND AS I MENTIONED IF WE- IDENTIFY ANY AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT THAT WE ALWAYS WORK WITH OUR LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AREAS- OUR OTHER PROGRAM AREAS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE. ON MEDICAID. IN REGARDS TO. PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION INFORMATION AND HOW IT'S REPORTED TO THE PUBLIC. SO OUR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION FOR OUR WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH ADMINISTER PROGRAMS ARE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND BE AT WORK FORCE ANIMATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT NARRATIVE REPORT. OR IS POSTED TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S WEBSITE ANNUALLY USUALLY AND DECEMBER- THE WSB ALSO PROVIDES PROGRAM DENIED TO THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO CREATE THE WORK FORCE METRICS DASHBOARD REPORT THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER EIGHTY TWENTY ONE FORTY EIGHT- IN ADDITION DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ALSO TAKES ALL THE DATA THAT WE SUBMIT TO THEM. AND THEY MAKE IT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITE AS WELL- AND YOU CAN DOWNLOAD IT THE BILLABLE FOR PUBLIC IF. WE UTILIZE PAST PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AS ONE OF OUR DECIDING FACTORS WHEN MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT ORGANIZATIONS OR DISCRETIONARY FUNDS STILL. JUST KIND OF- TRYING TO GET INTO HOW WE USE THEM OVER PERFORMANCE INFORMATION- AND WE ALSO LOOK AT PAST PERFORMANCE TO DRIVE POLICY DECISIONS- AND WHICH POPULATIONS TO CIRCLE SOME OF OUR DISCRETIONARY FUNDS AS WELL. AND THEN I THAT'S IT FOR MY PORTION- AND THEN FOR THE BASE WAGE AND I WAS GOING TO KICK IT OVER TO PAMELA. BUT SENATOR I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME BEFORE THAT OR YOU WANT TO PAMELA JUST. LET ME TRY TO PHRASE QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN A LAWYER I DO'T KNOW THAT I KNOW WHAT I ASK ON ANYMORE BUT- I'M- IN GOOD COMPANY I'M IN SACRAMENTO- DO WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE GRADUATES FROM. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMPLETED TRAINING PROGRAMS. AND YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THAT YOU CURRENTLY COMPILE. CAN YOU LOOK IT BUT SAY WAGE INCREASE BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED YOU CAN EARNINGS INCREASE YOU CAN MEASURE THAT DO WE KNOW WHETHER THIS EARNINGS INCREASE IS THE RESULT OF A NEW JOB IN A FIELD FOR WHICH THE EMPLOYEE RECEIVED TRAINING OR WHETHER IT'S IN A- THE EMPLOYEE SIMPLY STAYED IN THE GENERAL. FIELD OF WORK AND RECEIVE PROMOTIONS. SO WE- WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY KNOW- WE DON'T BUT LIKE I SAID WE ONLY TRACK OCCUPATION CODE WHEN. STOCK FOR ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS SO WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT AND THOSE INSTANCES OF BUT IF WE DON'T IT WOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT INDUSTRIES THING IF THERE ISN'T AN INDUSTRY CHANGE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL- BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM- BUT IT ALL KIND OF DEPENDS CASE BY CASE AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BLANKET ACROSS THE BOARD SAY YES WE CAN DO THAT TOO. WELL ABOVE THE I KEEP USING WAREHOUSES BUT REMEMBER I LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE CENTRAL DONE IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT SO I'M IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY AND I'VE BEEN A FORKLIFT OPERATOR AND- I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE INTO OF. FORKLIFT LEAD POSITION BUT I GO I SEE AN AD IN THE NEWSPAPER EITHER MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A PRIVATE SECTR TRAINING PROGRAM. AND I GO INTO TRAINING TO BE- I GUESS IF THIS IS THE JOB OF COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY CONTROL CLERK. SOUNDS GOOD RIGHT. AND I COMPLETE THIS TWELVE MONTH TRAINING PROGRAM AND COME OUT WITH THE CERTIFICATE. IT'S NOT A NECESSARILY A DEGREE PROGRAM BUT A CERTIFICATE FOR RATHER DETAILED. YOU KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY STUFF THAT OLD PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE TROUBLE WITH BUT I DO IT ANYWAY. BUT I COME OUT I DON'T GET A I CAN'T FIND A JOB AND I STAY IN THE WAREHOUSE INDUSTRY AND GET MY FORKLIFT PROMOTION TO LEAD. YOUR RECORDS ARE GOING TO SHOW. AN OVERALL EARNINGS INCREASE. ALBEIT IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER OR NOT I GOT MY JOB. AS A COMPUTERIZED INVENTORY CONTROL CLERK RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT. FOR ME ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT KEPT THE CROPS UP THEN IS HOW WE EVALUATE OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS SO. ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS IT WAS RECEIVED THE FUNDS. OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS YOU KNOW THE PASS I THINK LARGELY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH I THINK TIME AND TIME IN THE STATE WE- KICK IN MONEY. ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES FOR THESE PROGRAMS THAT. DON'T HAVE A VERY HIGH. A PERCENTAGE OF PLACING PEOPLE IN JOBS FOR WHICH THEY- RECEIVE MONEY AND PROVIDED TRAINING. YEAH I STILL FOR OUR PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED WE THE MAJORITY OF OUR FUNDS- YOU'RE REQUIRED TO USE A PROVIDER THAT'S LISTED ON THE OLD WILL TRAINING PROVIDER LIST- AND PART OF BEING ON THAT LIST IS ANNUALLY WE EVALUATE WHAT. PERFORMANCE LOOKS LIKE FOR THAT PROGRAM- AND IF THE PERFORMANCE FALLS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS THEN WE ALL WILL REMOVE THAT PROVIDER FROM THE LIST OR NOT PROGRAM FROM THE LIST I SHOULD SAY- AND THEN GIVE THE LOCAL AREAS CAN'T USE THAT PROGRAM ANYMORE SO THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING- ARE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TRAINING. BUT YOU'RE LIMITED TO THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE AGAINST. WHICH TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE RIGHT. YES THAT'S CORRECT SO YOU WOULDN'T SO I GUESS THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION ON IN TERMS OF CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT. INSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO COMPLETE THE TRAINING GET JOBS IN THE FIELD FOR WHICH ARE TRAINED. THERE'S NO MEANS TO EVALUATE THOSE TRAINING PROVIDERS CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT SO WE ARE ONLY MEASURING THE TRAINING PROVIDERS ON AT THE SAME- YEAH THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER SO EMPLOYMENT RATES THE MEDIAN WAGES CREDENTIAL TEAM MATT AND MEASURABLE SKILL GAMES SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT. TRAINING RELATED EMPLOYMENT OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL RECEIVED A JOB- AND- OKAY. CAN YOU MENTIONED TRYING TO TRUCK IN DEMAND INDUSTRIES IN A STATE OR LOCAL AREA BUT YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS REGIONAL LIES TO THE DATA SO THAT BECAUSE MOST TRAINING PROGRAMS A REGIONAL AND BY LESS PEOPLE OR MOBILE THEY GENERALLY- VERTICALLY THOSE- RETRAINING I WANT A JOB IN THE AREA WHERE THEY LIVE AND THEY'VE WORKED AND WHERE THEIR FAMILY IS IN OUR DATA DOESN'T REALLY ALLOW US TO DRILL DOWN AND- I GATHER AND OBTAIN REGIONALIZED- JOB. AVAILABILITY DATA. IT IS AM I RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE PERSON TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- WE DO HAVE STATISTICS BASED ON WHAT'S IN OUR CULTURAL SYSTEM ON JOB OPENINGS THAT ARE RECORDED WE DO ALSO RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM OUR LABOR MARKET- TEAM UP ON WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND YOU CAN DRILL DOWN- FUEL THE- METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA. I'M SO YOU CAN GET MORE REGIONALLY SPECIFIC BUT IN REGARDS TO OUR ELIGIBLE TRAINING PROVIDER LIST THAT I MENTIONED IN THE IN DEMAND INDUSTRIES WE REALLY RELY ON OUR LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AREAS. HE'LL BE AWARE OF THAT- AS OUR NOMINATING THE PROGRAMS RIGHT WELL LET ME ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION AND AGAIN- LET ME JUST SAY HOW- HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU AND ALL OF THE FOLKS AT THE E. D. I HAVE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO I'M NOT ONE TO. BE ADMINISTERING A SPANKING I THINK YOU ALL WORKED VERY VERY HARD UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU DO AND INCLUDING THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TAKING TIME AWAY FROM THAT WORKLOAD TO. COME TALK TO ME TODAY SO THANK YOU ONE OF THE AREAS THAT- I'M INTERESTED IN EXPLORING AT SOME POINT. IS ENHANCING OUR LABOR MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA. TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE DATA ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO YOU- AND FRANKLY HANDY KIP YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO DDD AND GIVING US THE INFORMATION AND PROVIDING THE GUIDANCE I THINK TO TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. AND THAT THOSE DATA ITEMS INCLUDE. OCCUPATION- A JOB SITE WAGE RATE TIED TO THE PARTICULAR OCCUPATION PARTICULAR JOB THAT THE INDIVIDUAL IS PERFORMING. HOW INVOLVED WITH AND I REALIZE YOU'RE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH SOME OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR DATA SYSTEMS. AND HAVING SPENT SIX YEARS ON BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR STATE ADMINISTRATION LOCAL GOVERNMENT I'VE SEEN EVERY I. T. PROJECT KNOWN TO MAN SO I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT THEY ARE. BUT HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO ADD. A FEW DATA LINES TO. YOUR SYSTEM AS IT IS BEING MODIFIED FOR OTHER REASONS SH SO I ACTUALLY AM GOING TO DEFERRED DOT QUESTION TO PAMELA BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S GOING TO COVER THAT AND- SECTION PERFECT WE'VE BEEN GREAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY AND APPRECIATE WHAT YOU DO. THANK YOU SENATOR. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS SET UP. CAMP KUTTNER DEPUTY DIRECTOR TAX BRANCH EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TODAY- TO NICOLE'S QUESTION AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN IN THE PRESENTATION- BUT- IT. THE BASE WAGE FILE IS A DATA BASE REPOSITORY FOR INFORMATION SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPANDING A DATABASE- SO REALLY LOOKING AT EXPANDING THE DATABASE IS BASED ON WHAT DATA ELEMENTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE- US TO CAPTURE. AND THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO- BRING THAT INFORMATION FORWARD TO US AND HAVING THE FUNDING MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT CHANGE SO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER SO WHAT WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE I THINK BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY MORE EXPERT THIS THAN I BUT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME IF WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW. IS WHAT THE JOB NEEDS OUR ACTUAL JOB NEEDS ARE IN A PARTICULAR REGION AND WHETHER INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE TRAINING AND RECEIVED A JOB IN THE FIELD FOR WHICH THEY ARE TRAINED. WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE A SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONAL. DATE OF. N. N. A WAGE RATE WITH ME AT A JOB. HAVE TO DEFERRED IN THE CALL OR LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION FROM THAT BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS CURRENTLY THE BASE WAGE FILE INFORMATION THAT'S REPORTED TO US INCLUDES THE EMPLOYEES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THEIR NAME WHICH IS FIRST MIDDLE INITIAL AND LAST THE TOTAL SUBJECT WAGES. WAGES IN THE PET WITHHELD SO THAT'S CURRENTLY WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE REPORTING TO US RIGHT NOW WE COLLECT THAT FROM THE- EMPLOYERS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DISABILITY INSURANCE PAID FAMILY LEAVE THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX PROGRAMS AND BASICALLY IT'S A DATABASE REPOSITORY WHERE THE WAGES THAT INFORMATION IS MAINTAINED AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE QUANTITY OF THE DATA THAT WE RECEIVE IN THIS AREA WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION EMPLOYERS AND THEY REPORT AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAGE LINES EACH QUARTER. BUT IT IS IT MOSTLY ELECTRONIC REPORTING. I NINE POINT 9% IS ELECTRONIC REPORTING WHICH WOULD WHICH IS WHICH SHOULD EASE THE WORKLOAD A LITTLE BIT FOR. EVERYONE I WOULD THINK- WE'VE BEEN PHENOMENALLY SUCCESSFUL AND HAVING- ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM WE HAVE MULTIPLE CHANNELS AVAILABLE TO THE EMPLOYER TO REPORT TO US- VIA- AN ONLINE SYSTEM WE ALSO DO BULK FILE TRANSFERS AND- WE HAVE A VERY SMALL PAPER PROCESSING- FOR TAX INFORMATION- I'M STILL ON GOING. ON ONE OF MY THOUGHTS IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE PROCESS THROUGH THE PIPELINE FOR. TRAINING JOB TRAINING AND JOB RETRAINING- IS SIGNIFICANT AND I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT MAY BE MUCH MORE THAN THAT YOU ALL WOULD KNOW THAT. AND THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOLKS WOULD KNOW THAT. BUT THE SAVINGS IN CUTTING OUT THE WASTED TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THE TRAINING IS ACTUALLY DELIVERED TO PEOPLE WHO NEED TRAINING FOR JOBS THAT ACTUALLY EXIST. MY UNINFORMED GREATLY UNINFORMED BRAIN TELLS ME WOULD PROBABLY PAY. CERTAINLY OVER THE LONG RUN FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE TO THE DATA SYSTEM IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE DATA. TO DETERMINE JOB NEEDS AND JOB MATCH YES IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT I DON'T I DON'T I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO. YOU KNOW. THIS IS NOT GONNA GOTCHA BUT I DID JUST MY THOUGHT THAT THERE MIGHT BE IF WE CAN'T TELL WHETHER THE TRAINING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO EMPLOYEES RESULTS IN A JOB IN THAT FIELD FOR WHICH WE ARE PROVIDING THE TRAINING AN EMPLOYEE HAS TO GO DO SOMETHING ELSE THEN THERE SHOULD BE A VALUE ATTACHED TO THAT THAT COULD BE SAVED IF WE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE THE LINES CONNECT. AND I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. I DON'T- I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MAN DO I MISS ANYTHING. DO YOU WANT ME TO GO THROUGH THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU SUBMITTED ABOUT WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR RESEARCH FOR OTHER STATES YES MA'AM THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- YOU DID ASK- US TO COMPARE BASE WHICH DATABASE TO WHAT WAS DONE IN OTHER STATES. WE'RE NOT EXPERTS IN WHAT THE OTHER STATES TOO SO WE WENT OUT AND DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH- WE LOOKED AT THE THREE LARGEST STATES- WHICH CALIFORNIA IS BY FAR THE LARGEST BUT WE ALSO- LOOKED AT NEW YORK FLORIDA AND TEXAS AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE STREET THREE STATES THAT ARE CLOSEST TO CALIFORNIA OREGON NEVADA AND ARIZONA. AND WE FOUND THAT- FOR THE MOST PART THE DATA COLLECTED BY THESE STATES IS THE SAME AS THE DATA ELEMENTS EDT COLLECTS WITH ONE EXCEPTION- WHICH WAS OREGON AND THEY COLLECT THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED FOR EACH EMPLOYEE. THEN WE WENT OUT- AND LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF OTHER STATES- WHAT DATA THEY WERE COLLECTING. AND SOME OF THE STATES THAT WE LOOKED AT WERE ALASKA INDIANA IOWA REALLY STATES THAT HAD- QUITE A BIT OF PUBLIC INFORMATION OUT THERE AND BASED ON OUR LIMITED RESEARCH THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF VARIANCE BETWEEN THE DATA ELEMENTS OF THE OTHER STATES COLLECTED. RANGING FROM HOURS AND WEEKS WORK TO THE STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CODE AND WHETHER AND THERE'S ALSO A VARIANCE AND WHETHER THE DATA IS MANDATORY OR VOLUNTARY FOR THE EMPLOYER TO REPORT IT. SO WE FOUND FIVE STATES THE COLLECTED HOURS WORKED FOR HAD WEEKS WORK- THREE STATES DID ASK FOR THE STANDARD OCCUPATIONAL CODE ENTRY STATES WANTED WORK LOCATION- BUT INTO THE STATES IT WAS VOLUNTARY AS OPPOSED TO- MANDATORY. DATA COLLECTION- THERE WAS ALSO QUITE AROUND- WHAT IT JUST ALL TYPES OF DATA INCLUDING DATA ON EMPLOYEE OCCUPATION COULD BE COLLECTED THROUGH THE BASE WHICH FILE AND I THINK I DRESS THAT EARLIER BUT THE DATA THAT COULD BE COLLECTED THROUGH THE BASE WAGE FILE WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON LEGISLATION AND WHAT WAS MANDATED TO BE REPORTED BY THE EMPLOYERS- EDIE'S CAPACITY TO RESTRUCTURE THE EMPLOYER'S REPORT- AND FOR THE EMPLOYERS TO COMPLY WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL DATA ELEMENTS AND THEN THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO COMPLY. SO THOSE ARE REALLY THE THINGS THREE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT WHEN MAKING ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGE OR IMPACT OF THE EMPLOYER- WE HAVE A LOOK- AND ANALYZED PRIOR LEGISLATION THAT'S ASKED US TO EXPAND THE BASE WAGE FILE SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WERE UNFAMILIAR WITH DOING THE ANALYSIS WE HAVEN'T DONE A MAJOR DATABASE RESTRUCTURE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE- BUT- IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE COSTED OUT MULTIPLE TIMES DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ASK WAS FROM THE LEGISLATURE. OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN DOING- DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE SAME ARENA- SOME STATES REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO REPORT ELECTRONICALLY WHICH AS YOU MENTIONED FACILITATES- EASIER- REPORTING OF. DATA ELEMENTS AS THEY CHANGE YOUR EYES. ARE EXPANDED- CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS AN ELECTRONIC REPORTING MANDATE IN PLACE- TWELVE STATES COLLECT ONE OR MORE OF TEN DIFFERENT ENHANCED DATA VARIABLES. AND THERE WAS A STATE SURVEY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT LOOKED AT THE USES FOR THOSE EXPANDED VARIABLES WHICH WAS ALIGNING EDUCATION WORKFORCE TRAINING- SUPPLY WITH EMPLOYER DEMANDS FOR LABOUR DEVELOPING MORE EFFECTIVE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. PROVIDING CONSUMER INFORMATION FOR IMPROVED DECISION MAKING- SUPPORTING MORE EFFICIENT LABOR MARKETS STRENGTHENING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. AND HELPING BUSINESSES COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THEIR REGION- ALSO IMPROVING CORPORATE HIRING AND RETENTION PRACTICES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND PROMOTING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY IN PUBLIC SPENDING ON EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS- MANY STATES HAVE REPLACED THEIR DECADES OLD TECHNOLOGY WITH MODERN DATABASES THAT ARE FLEXIBLE AND HANDLING MONEY. FOR CATIONS- AND WE ALSO HAVE- STATES THAT HAVE RESTRUCTURED THEIR REPORTING MECHANISMS TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL- DATA ELEMENTS IT'S- IF YOU NEED IN THE PROCESS OF. NINETY PROJECT NOW TO UPGRADE YOUR SYSTEMS- YOU KNOW IT IT IT HAS A VARIETY OF SYSTEMS- DEPENDING ON AND THEN THEY'RE SOMEWHAT PROGRAM SPECIFIC WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT A RE IMAGINED BUSINESS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION. PROJECT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE DISABILITY INSURANCE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAMS THE BASE WAGE DATABASE IS A REPOSITORY THAT THEY TIE INTO BUT IS NOT SPECIFICALLY IN THAT. PROJECT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS BUT- IF WE WERE TO PURSUE- A LEGISLATIVE EFFORT TO EXPAND THE WHAT I CALL LITTLE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION SYSTEM I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL THE BASE WAGE FILE. TO INCLUDE A LITTLE LIMITED DATA POINTS ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS BUT BUT DATA POINTS THAT WILL AT LEAST GIVE US THE ABILITY TO MEASURE. THE PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FOR PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF RETRAINING. OF. HOW HOW MUCH LEAD TIME WITH THE EDT REQUIRE FOR THAT SORT OF LEGISLATION TO TAKE EFFECT IN ORDER TO GIVE YOU THE TIME TO. OF SYNC THROUGH APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED AS YOU'RE MOVING THROUGH YOUR OTHER I. T. MODERNIZATION PROGRAMS. I WOULD DEFER THAT QUESTION TORE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOLKS AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU IT DOES HAVE A PROGRAM COMPONENT THAT I CAN SPEAK TO WHEN WE WENT TO ELECTRONIC REPORTING WHICH WAS REALLY MOVING OUR EMPLOYERS OFF OF PAPER WE TOOK A TWO AND A HALF YOUR LEAD TIME AND THAT WAS FOR MARKETING AND OUTREACH IT WAS ALSO TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS TIME TO MODIFY THEIR SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE ELECTRONIC REPORTING SH AND A LOT OF THE SAME CONSIDERATIONS ARE AT PLAY HERE- WE WOULD NEED TO REPROGRAM OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS. MODIFY EXISTING DATABASES REPORTING STRUCTURES WE WOULD NEED TO ESTABLISH TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AND LOOK AT DATA STORAGE. SO INTERNALLY WE HAVE TO DEVELOP A MARKETING AND OUTREACH PLAN TO LET EMPLOYERS KNOW- WHAT THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WERE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN OUR STAFF IN ORDER TO SUPPORT EMPLOYERS IN THIS NEW EFFORT. FROM THE EMPLOYER SIDE- THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL COST YOU PROBABLY CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES REPORT THE DATA ELEMENTS AND THEY WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO. RESTRUCTURE AND MODIFY THEIR INTERNAL- PAYROLL REPORTING SYSTEMS AND THEN RELATED TO THAT WE ALSO HAVE PAYROLL AGENTS AND SOFTWARE VENDORS WHO SUPPLY PAYROLL REPORTING- TECHNOLOGY AND THEY WOULD ALSO NEED LATE LEAD TIME. WE'D ALSO PROBABLY NEED TO LOOK AT SOME GOOD- TOP NOTCH- MARKETING AND OUTREACH MATERIALS TO MAKE SURE THAT EMPLOYERS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE REPORTING AND THAT THERE WERE NOT ANY QUESTIONS- SO WE DIDN'T END UP IN THE SAME PLACE WE WOULD WANT THEM TO HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEEDED. TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THE INFORMATION THAT THE LABOR MARKET WAS REQUESTING- WE NEED SOME STANDARDIZATION AROUND OCCUPATIONAL CODING- WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT TYPES OF IN- COMPENSATION MODELS- THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED- AND THAT WOULD TAKE SOME- EXTENSIVE MARKETING AND OUTREACH. JUST CURIOUS THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS THAT YOU PROGRAM FOR THAT PARTICULAR THE CHANGE THAT YOU REFERRED TO WAS THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS ADEQUATE OR DID YOU TEND TO. RUN BEYOND THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS IN ORDER FOR. THE MEDICATION THAT WAS MOSTLY A MARKETING AND OUTREACH PLAN- AND AGAIN NINETY NINE POINT 9% COMPLIANCE AT THE END OF THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS. WE HAD A YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE WE DID- WE- DID IT IN PHASES. SO WE REALLY HAD A YEAR AND A HALF OF MARKETING AND THEN WE IMPLEMENTED FOR LARGE EMPLOYERS AND THEN THE SECOND YEAR WE IMPLEMENTED FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS SO IT GAVE US A TRANSITION PERIOD. EXCELLENT WELL YOU KNOW PART OF MY CONCERN IS. THE EIGHTY D. IS THE ONLY DATA REPOSITORY THAT WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE AT LEAST THE ONES THAT ARE THE DATA REPOSITORY THAT SOMEWHAT ACCESSIBLE. AND WITHOUT SOME ADDITIONAL DATA FROM THE E. D. IT SEEMS TO ME IN THE TESTIMONY TODAY SORT OF SUPPORTS THIS THAT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO EVALUATE OUR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO GIVE THEM AN A B. C. D. OR F. BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DOING THE JOB THAT THEY'VE TOLD THE STUDENT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WITH THE TRAINEE. OR THE JOB THAT THEY'VE TOLD US THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MONEY THAT WE- PROVIDED THROUGH GRANTS TO FACILITATE THE TRAINING SO WE'LL HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THIS SITE LISTEN I RECOGNIZED THE BURDEN THAT. THE EDT IS UNDER PARTICULARLY NOW AND THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE TIME TO ADD MORE TO IT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO. HAVE A CONTINUED THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON ON HOW WE CAN PLAN FORWARD. TO MAYBE ADD SOME DATA POINTS TO THE BASE WAGE FILE OR WHEREVER IT NEEDS TO GO SO THAT WE CAN PERFORM THIS SORT OF EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT. OF OUR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS BUT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM YOU'VE BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE. DID I FEEL THERE'S SOMETHING- YOU DID ASK US- FOR POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES- IN ORDER TO. SMOOTH THE TRANSITION PER SE- YOU KNOW- DEBILITY DEVELOP TOOLS AND SYSTEMS FOR SOME OCCUPATIONAL ANGIOGRAPHIC COATING MAKING NOT SIMPLER- IDENTIFYING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR STATE YOU WHY UPGRADES BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE AN UPGRADE- WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC WITH FEDERAL FUNDING IT WOULD REQUIRE STATE FUNDING AND ENHANCED WAGE RECORDS- COULD REDUCE THE EMPLOYER SURVEY BURDEN- YOU KNOW ELLEN MY G. DOES QUITE A BIT OF STARVING OUT TO TRY TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU PRODUCT TODAY. AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT WHICH WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED. YOU ALSO ASK US IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO REQUIRE YOU TO DO TO SECURE DATA ON ENTREPRENEURS AND GIG ECONOMY EMPLOYEES- RIGHT NOW IF THE GIG GIG IS SUCH A BIG WORD- IT COVERS MANY MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT- AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN- WORKER AND A SERVICE PROVIDER. EDT CURRENTLY COLLECTS DATA FROM EMPLOYERS ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AND. IF- IF. A WORKER IS TO BE AN EMPLOYEE THAT INFORMATION IS REPORTED TO EDG. SHE HAS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD SO- THERE ARE. REPORTING MECHANISMS AVAILABLE FOR THE GIG ECONOMY EMPLOYEES. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THREE FUTURE HELP THEM LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A AN ITEM THAT TO THE EXTENT THE LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE WISHES TO PURSUE IT WILL NEED TO OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE BUT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP- AND HELP FROM YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR- TESTIMONY TODAY. IT WAS WELL THANK YOU. OUR NEXT PANELIST MARIA MORADO EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICESCALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THANK YOU MA'AM GOOD TO HAVE YOU. AFTERNOON HOW ARE YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M BACK I APOLOGIZE I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS SO BEAR WITH ME HERE HI VERY EXCITED TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON AND GET TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW WE HAVE BEEN MEASURING PERFORMANCE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AS YOU ARE LIKELY VERY AWARE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN OPPORTUNITY COLLEGES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. I'M IN SEVENTY THREE LOCALLY ELECTED DISTRICT SERVING ROUGHLY TWO MILLION STUDENTS ANNUALLY- SO WHAT WE I IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I'LL START THERE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE LAUNCHED THE VISION FOR SUCCESS I'M VERY FOCUSED OUTCOMES ORIENTED STUDENT CENTERED AGENDA. THAT THAT PROMPTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHAT WE CALL OUR STUDENTS SUCCESS METRICS THE STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS I'M NOT AS STUDENTS PROGRESS AND OUTCOMES ACROSS A RANGE OF. MILESTONES FROM EXPLORATION AND ENROLLMENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH Q. OUTCOMES AND EMPLOYMENT FOR OUR CAREER TECHNICAL WORK FOR STUDENTS- THROUGH THIS EFFORT WE HAVE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THREE KEY AREAS- ONE MAINTAINING A FOCUS FOR OUR STUDENTS WHAT IS OUR JOB OUR JOB IS TO PRODUCE THESE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT. WE ARE MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STUDENTS WHO COME TO US AND THE STATE'S INVESTMENTS SECOND WE ARE FOCUSED ON TRANSPARENCY THE STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS HI IT IS AVAILABLE ON A PUBLIC FACING DASHBOARD ALONG WITH A HANDFUL OF OTHER DASHBOARDS THAT INCLUDE EVALUATION AND OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. I AND MANY OF OUR KEY REFORM INITIATIVES SUCH AS GUIDED PATHWAYS AND OTHER EFFORTS- AND THEN LASTLY THE THIRD COMPONENT THAT WE REALLY TRY TO MAINTAIN A FOCUS ON ITS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND IMPACT AGAIN IN THE SPIRIT OF BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALSO NOT USING THIS DATA. OR WHAT I APPRECIATED HEARING YOUR TECHNOLOGY RIGHT WE'RE NOT USING IT FOR THE GOTCHA MOMENTS REALLY USING IT FOR INFORMING HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND. GET BETTER WE HAVE TO MAKE IT TRANSPARENT WE HAVE TO RIGHT WITH DAY AND THEN WE HAVE TO. I'M WHERE THOSE FOR POINTS ARE IN PROCESS IS NOT. IN OUR STATE. AND REALLY MAKE SURE THE WE ARE FORWARD AND I'M TRYING TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES SH I SPECIFIC OR THE WORKFORCE DATA COMPONENTS- JUST HEARING A LITTLE BIT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THUS FAR I WANTED TO HIT ON A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS. YOU'VE BEEN NOTING THAT- THE CHALLENGE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN OUR UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE OCCUPATIONS WHAT IS THE LOCAL LABOR MARKET DATA AND WHETHER OR NOT OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS. ARE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MEET THOSE NEEDS WHAT I WOULD POINT ZERO IS OUR CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE. INVESTED IN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING AND WORKING WITH OUR REGIONAL LABOR MARKET DATA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR WORKFORCE- WITH OUR WORKFORCE PARTNERS- AND REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO. WHO IS THE EMPLOYER BASED- WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND REGIONS WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE REGIONAL AND- COMMUNITY. COLLEGE WORKFORCE. I SH WHAT I WOULD ALSO POINT. IS YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT OUR FIRST SPEAKER CAN RAINING NOTED. WHICH IS THAT THERE IS DEATH- THERE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THIS THAT IS LOCAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND PERSON TO PERSON INTERACTION SH THE LABOR MARKET DATA TELLS US. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT FIND WHEN WE LOOK WITHIN THE REGION HOWEVER IT'S BY TALKING TO INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYERS TO UNDERSTAND THE MORE NUANCED. SKILLS COMPETENCIES THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE OCCUPATION IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO. HELP THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT ALSO IS THAT EVERY STUDENT WHO COMES TO US HAS A UNIQUE SET OF BACKGROUND EXPERIENCES. AND RESUMES AND SO WE ARE CONTINUALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW DO WE ADAPT. OUR INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS WERE JUST IN TME TRAINING THAT WILL ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE OUT AND PROGRESS WITHIN THEIR CAREER TRAJECTORY. WITHOUT FORCING THEM TO REMAIN OUT WITHIN AN EDUCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO. RIGHT SO. THAT IT REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE NUANCED INTERACTION BOTH WITH THE EMPLOYER AT THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT AND THEN WITH OUR INSTRUCTIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS- HOWEVER IN ORDER TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW EFFECTIVE OUR WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE AT PLACING STUDENTS WITHIN THOSE OCCUPATIONS AND WITHIN THE- INDUSTRY SECTORS. WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL THE C. T. E. EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES SURVEY. I THIS IS A SURVEY SURVEYS HIS NAME. THAT WE ADMINISTERED ZERO- THE MAJORITY OF OUR C. T. COMPLETE- STUDENTS SO ANYONE WHO HAS. ENROLLED IN AND COMPLETED A WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. I WE WOULD RECEIVE ROUGHLY A 25% RESPONSE RATE IN WHAT WE SEE THERE IS THATSTUDENTS TO COMPLETE A TRAINING PROGRAM AND ACTUALLY MOVE INTO THEIR FIELD OF STUDY DO YOU SEE INCREASES IN EARNINGS EARLY SIGNIFICANCE. BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT DOLLAR INCREASES IN EARNINGS- AND PROMOTIONS WHAT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE THOUGH IS THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE COUPLING THIS INFORMATION WITH. OUR STUDENT SUCCESS METRIC INFORMATION DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH U. D. D. AND OTHER. ODD MORE KIND DEFINABLE. HARDER HARD AT ALL- THAT DAY. IF YOU WELL RECCA. THE FEEDING THURSDAY IS IT STILL RECORD OR IT'S AS TAKE YOU REPORT IT ENDED. RECALL IT'S NOT AS- VALIDATE. I NEED IT HAVE THE- OR THOSE HI. WHO WERE. TO SURVEY VERSUS WHO DID REST RESPOND TO THE SURVEY I'M SO WE TAKE ALL OF THAT INTO ACCOUNT AS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL. AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE NEED WITHIN OUR SYSTEM SH- THE LAST THING I WANT TO FOCUS ON AND THEN I AM. A MUCH BETTER WITH YOU IN A- THE LAST THING I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS OUR PARTNERSHIP AND RELATIONSHIP. AGAIN GOING BACK TO OUR OPENING SPEAKER THAT REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS EVOLUTION ON. BOTH OUR WORKFORCE AND THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED WITHIN OUR RESPECTIVE SYSTEMS. FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WE ARE CONTINUALLY WRESTLING WITH HOW DO WE ADAPT OUR DELIVERY MODALITIES. IN ORDER TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS GIVEN WHERE OUR CURRENT ECONOMY IS AND WHERE IT IS HEADED. RIGHT IT ISN'T THE FUTURE OF WORK REMOTE WORK IS HERE RIGHT NOW RIGHT THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND SO WHEN EVEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW- MAPPING OUT TRAINING PROGRAMS TO REGIONAL ECONOMIES WHAT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN THAT PORTFOLIO IS THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL NOW BE WORKING REMOTES. AND OR WHO WILL HAVE OCCUPATIONS THAT. ARE NOT NECESSARILY PLACE BALANCED- AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CONTINUALLY WRESTLING WITH AND AGAIN IN ORDER TO ADAPT- TRAINING PROGRAMS. TO HAVE JUST IN TIME. I AM VERY TAILORED. OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG ATTAINMENT AND- IN. GOING LIKE TO CALL IT I'M ARE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE INCREASE- ARKHAM. AND NEXT. AROUND EACH FOCUSING COM. ARE RATHER THAN FULL OCCUPATIONS WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE SKILL SETS THAT I EMPLOYERS ARE ASKING US FOR AND HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT MODALITIES FOR DELIVERING THOSE. POPPINS I IN A WAY THAT- STUDENTS CAN LEARN AND MOVE ON AND LEARN AND MOVE ON AND CONTINUE TO ENGAGE AND RE ENGAGE. BOTH WITHIN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AS WELL AS IN THE WORK FORCE THE LAST THING I'LL ALSO POINT HERE IS THAT WHAT WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH THIS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE VALIDATING. AUGMENTING AND ENHANCING THE EXPERIENCES THE LIVES. IT WORK EXPERIENCES THAT- INDIVIDUALS ARE HAVING WHERE THEY ARE LEARNING ON THE JOB SO WHETHER THAT'S A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS OR WHETHER THAT'S CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING REALLY MAKING SRE THAT WE ARE. NOT ASKING STUDENTS TO REPEAT THINGS THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY MASTERED THAT REALLY ENSURING THAT THEY CAN'T THEY HAVE VEHICLES FOR DEMONSTRATING MASTERY- AND PROVIDING- PROVIDING THE TRANSCRIPTS FOR THOSE EFFORTS. ALL OF THIS TO SAY- WE AREN'T I WOULD. HIGHLY COGNISANT AND WORK OUT RIGHT ALONGSIDE OUR PARTNERS IN WORKFORCE AND EDT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE EVOLVE AS A SYSTEM OUR DATA SYSTEMS ARE CAPTURING THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP US WITH CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS. I AM ALSO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP J. IDENTIFY WHERE WE NEED TO EVOLVE AS THE SYSTEMS TO BEST MEET THE. NEEDS ARE FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND I WILL PAUSE THERE. LET ME JUST SAY DID A GREAT JOB YOU SHOULDN'T BE NERVOUS THANK YOU. YOU KNOW THE- COMMON QUESTION THAT I MADE AT THE OUTSET HAVING TO DO WITH THEM. WHEN I ASK. IT'S ACTUALLY A LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO THE PERSON AND ONE OF OUR REGIONS OF THE STATE OR I WOULD GO TO FIND OUT ABOUT A PARTICULAR JOB SKILL THAT WAS REQUIRED WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A JOB SKILLS INVENTORY IT WAS THE LOCAL WORKFORCE PERSON WHO SAID I HAVE NO IDEA. AND MY RESPONSE WAS WELL IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO DOES. AND THAT'S THE G. THAT'S THE GENESIS OF MY OF MY CONCERN AND REALLY THE- THE GENESIS OF THIS HEARING WAS TO. RECOGNIZE THE OUTSTANDING JOB FRANKLY THAT THE DVD DOES OUTSTANDING JOB AT OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AROUND THE STATE DO AND FRANKLY THE EXTRAORDINARY JOB AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO BOTH IN READYING STUDENTS FOR. FOUR YEAR PROGRAMS ELSEWHERE AND IN THE NON DEGREE CTE PROGRAMS THAT YOU WERE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT AND SO WHAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO THROUGH THIS HEARING IN THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS TO. TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE TO THE SYSTEM INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS AND THE DATA AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU CONTINUE TO DO THE INCREDIBLE JOB THAT- YOU ALL. IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM DO EVERY DAY FOUR OF STUDENTS IN AND TRAINEES IN OUR STATE. YOU MENTIONED THE C. T. OUTCOME SURVEY AND YOU. SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED WHEN YOU HAVE A- YOU KNOW THE VALIDATION ISSUE IN THEM AND THE BIAS QUESTIONS BUT- THE ONES THAT DID RESPOND SO THEY SHOW A WAGE INCREASE. BUT ARE YOU ABLE TO TELL FROM THE RESPONSES TO THE C. T. OUTCOME SURVEY WHETHER THE INDIVIDUALS WHO THE 25% OF ACTUALLY COMPLETED THE SURVEY. SECURE JOBS IN THE SPECIFIC FIELD FOR WHICH THEY WERE TRAINED. WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AGAIN SELF REPORTED ON BUT THAT WAS REALLY ONE OF THE GENESIS OF THE OUTCOME SURVEY WAS WANTING TO UNPACK AND GET CLOSER TO ZERO WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS BELIEVE THEY ARE WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY SECTOR THAT THEY TRAINED FOR ALL POINT TO THE EXAMPLE THE QUALIFICATION I BUT THERE IS A POINT TO THE EXAMPLE- IMA HAVE TRAINED IN NINETEEN. BUT MY OCCUPATION IS IN HEALTH CARE BECAUSE I WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR BECAUSE I WORK IN IT IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR RIGHT SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE SURVEY EVEN AS AN IMPERFECT TOOL IT'S STILL A REALLY CRITICAL TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS HAPPENING TO STUDENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT. THEY BELIEVE THEY ARE WORKING WITHIN THAT SECTOR THAT THEY TRAIN FOR OUT WHERE THEY ARE WORKING WITHIN THE SECTOR THEY TRAIN FOR WE SEE HIGHER. INCREASES IN EARNINGS AND AN ACT YEAH HIGHER INCREASES IN EARNINGS. AND I GUESS THE TEST IS HOW YOU HOW YOU MOVE BEYOND THE C. T. OUTCOME SURVEY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE FURTHER SPECIFIC JOB NEEDS ARE IN A PARTICULAR REGION BEYOND GOING EMPLOYER TO EMPLOYER AND I REALIZED I MEAN THAT'S THE- THE CALIBRATE. PROCESS WAS TO GO REGIONAL AND TALK TO EMPLOYERS TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS AND DESIGN TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC. NEEDS AND THAT'S FINE. BUT THAT'S IT'S- TO- INSTITUTE. THAT IF I CAN USE THE STATE AS AN INSTITUTION AND TAKE IT STATEWIDE. RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF SPECIFIC. TO RELATIONSHIPS OF LOCAL COMMUNICATION OCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE WITH LOCAL EMPLOYER GROUPS LOCAL EMPLOYERS. AND MAY BE A HYPERACTIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THAT IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT IN MY CORRECT. I THINK IT'S I THINK YES AND NO RIGHT I THINK IT'S A BOTH DAN. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE DEFINITELY HAVE IS A SYSTEM. THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO BOTH CAPTURE THE DATA AS WELL AS MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. IS THAT WE HAVEN'T FULLY BUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO EFFECTIVELYSUPPORT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND BY THAT I MEAN THERE IS A LOT OF WORK FORCE AN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. FINANCE ENGAGEMENT HAPPENING THROUGH WORK STUDY THROUGH COOPERATIVE WORK EXPERIENCE- AND OTHER TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES THAT AREN'T ALWAYS- WELL CONNECTED. TO THE WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE- EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED ON A CAMPUS WHERE THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS. SO GO BACK TO WHERE YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL WHO SAID I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND THAT. EVEN THOUGH I'M FAMILIAR WITH- IN YOUR REGION. YOU HAVE SOME AMAZING WORKFORCE PROFESSIONALS THERE WHO ARE WELL CAPTAIN AND HAVE LOTS OF REALLY ROBUST NETWORK SH- IT'S NOT AS DIFFUSED WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE THINKS ABOUT OR IS FAMILIAR WITH AND THAT CREATES PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS. AND SO THIS IS WHERE I WOULD POINT YOU IT IS LOCALIZED AND WE HAVE TO BE BUILDING THE INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT ENABLES MORE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE WORK FORCE DISCUSSIONS AND NOT BASEBALL'S BIKER CATION. THERE ARE STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKFORCE IN THEIR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT BECAUSE EVERYONE COMES OR INSTITUTION LOOKING FOR CAREER STABILITY AND CAREER GROWTH. AND I GUESS IS THE GOVERNOR'S A. CRADLE TO CAREER. DAY ASH BOARD- IS BUILT TO BIG. ROBUST AND FULLY UP THAT WILL UNDER HELP IN CONNECTING. THE DOTS HERE. EAST WITHIN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND THEN BUT THAT'S OF COURSE WHY WERE EXPLORING WITH EDT SOMETHING ON A BROADER SCALE TO DRAW. ALL EMPLOYERS INTO THIS PROCESS TO DRAW ALL OF CALIFORNIA INTO THIS PROCESS AND THEY HAVE SOME RATHER SPECIFIC REGIONAL JOB NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY REGION SO THAT THOSE OF YOU IN THE IN THE TRAINING BUSINESS IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OTHERWISE WE'LL HAVE TARGETS TO LOOK TOWARD PROGRAMS TO DESIGN THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO A REGION AND THEN OUT COMES. TO MEASURE AND BE- GRATED ON SO. GREAT JOB ANYTHING ELSE. HI I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH COVERS IT I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN YOU THIS AFTERNOON WELL YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. OUR NEXT PANELIST TERROR ARMSTRONG DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL BRANCH CIO EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. THERE YOU ARE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR THE INTRO SO GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT GENERALLY THAT ARE OUR PROGRAM IS MUCH DIFFERENT AND THAT WE BASE OUR PROGRAM- THROUGH THE LENSES OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. SO BASICALLY THE BUSINESSES AND ENTITIES THEY COME TO US FOR RESOURCES TO TRAIN THEIR CURRENT AND OUR FUTURE WORKFORCE SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE SKILLED WORKERS AND BE COMPETITIVE BIKE WITHIN THEIR INDUSTRY. SO ALL OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH EMPLOYERS MEDIAN THAT. A CERTAIN WAGE BENCHMARK AND THEN BEING RETAINED FOR A PERIOD OF NINETY DAYS- BEFORE THAT THEY CAN BE DONE WITH THE TRAINING CONTRACT AND THEN- PAYMENT. SO JUST KIND OF REITERATE WE ARE PERFORMANCE BASED CONTRACTING KIND OF MACHINE HERE- SO IF YOU DON'T TRAIN EMPLOYEE FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS AND THEN REACH HAND. ROOM ONLY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN MEET THE WAGE FOR THAT PARTICULAR EMPLOYEE THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR THAT. ANY SO WE DO HAVE A VERY HIGH DEMAND ETP'S SO WE DO SET THESE FILTERS ON THESE PRIORITIES AND BENCHMARKS SO ONE THAT WE DO CONCENTRATE ON IS LOOKING AT INDUSTRIES THAT ARE FACING AN OUT OF STATE COMPETITION- SUCH AS LIKE A MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION- WE DO A LOT ALSO LOOKING AT HEALTH CARE AND TECHNICAL SERVICES- THE NDTV ALSO SETS UP THESE PRIORITY PROGRAMS AND WE CHANGES EACH FISCAL YEAR BASED ON CALIFORNIA- NEEDS OF POPULATIONS AND BUSINESSES- TO HELP THEM- YOU KNOW TRAINEES ENTITIES THAT WE LOOK AT. ARE THE TRAINING NEW HIRES- PROGRAMS FOR INCENTIVES- FOR TRAINING VETERANS AND SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES. AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THOSE WORK PLACES THAT ARE IN THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT AREAS. SO I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ANNUALLY ETP IS- FUNNY APPROXIMATELY NINETY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EACH YEAR AND WITHIN THOSE NINETY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE REACHING ABOUT THREE THOUSAND BUSINESSES- AND I WOULD SAY WITH. LOOKING AT JUST A SIXTY JUST THIS LAST YEAR AND THOSE NINETY THOUSAND ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND WERE IN SMALL BUSINESS AREAS AND OF ALMOST TEN THOUSAND OR INDIA HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. LOCATIONS SO WE DON'T HAVE A DISCONNECT WITH YOU. WE GOT WE HAVE A LOT OF INCOME BUT INCOME IN TRAINING HERE I MEAN AND WE EVEN LOOK AT THE- OCCUPATIONS THAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO TRAIN BEFORE WE EVEN GET MY CONTRACT AND LIKE WHAT THEIR CURRICULUM. IS THAT THEY ARE NEEDING WITHIN THEIR ENTITY- WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF TRAINEES FOR THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS ARE FOR EACH OF THOSE TRAINEES. WHEN THEIR WAGES ARE HOW MANY HOURS ARE BEING TRAINED SO IT WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA. FOR ONE IT IT SOUNDS AS IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DO. SORT OF A REGIONAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF JOBS IS THAT CORRECT I MEAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT JOBS WHAT TRAINING IS NEEDED IN PARTICULAR REGIONS BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DO. WELL SO WHEN THE EXCUSE COME TO US THEY ARE MOSTLY INCUMBENT WORKERS SO THEY'RE ALREADY IN THE OCCUPATIONS OF THE OCCUPATIONS AND THE TRAINING THAT THEY'RE GIVING THOSE OCCUPATIONS IN THOSE TRAINEES. THEY'RE ALREADY TIED TOGETHER I MEAN THAT'S HOW OUR PROGRAM IS MOSTLY DESIGNED. I SEE AFTER YOU DON'T FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO. BECAUSE OF YOUR INVOLVEMENT LET'S SAY IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO. TELL THAT THERE LET'S SAY YOUR TRAINING YOU HAVE INCOME OF WORKERS THAT ARE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGISTS TECHNOLOGY TYPES IT TYPES YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER THERE IS AN UNMET NEED OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY I. T. TYPES IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO. NOW I'M BUT WE DO HAVE LIKE A NEW HIRE OR COMPONENT- TTP AND THAT WE CANNOT TELL YOU KNOW IF THEIR TRAINING AND WHERE THEY WERE PLACED AT THE END WE DO TRACK WAGES- BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU GO TO THAT BASE WHICH FILE TO CHECK THAT WAGE BUT WE DO NOT KNOW THEIR OCCUPATION DO YOU HAVE THE SAME LIMITATION THAT ALL THE REST OF US HAVE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF OUR- BASE WAGE FILE. YEAH AND I LIKE YOUR IDEA THERE FOR SURE. WHO WILL. WHETHER THAT HAS ANY LEGS. YES SO- I DO ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- ONE OF ONE THINGS THAT WE ARE ADDING TO OUR PROGRAM IS COLLECTING THE WAGE AND ROMANCE SO WHEN COMPANIES COME IN THEY GET THEIR CONTRACT WITH US THEY ENROLL THEIR TRAINEES AND THEN AT THAT TIME THAT THEY WOULD GIVE US THE WAGE FOR THAT TRAINEE THEY WOULD PERFORM THEIR TRAINING AND THEN THEY'D BE HELD HER RETENTION PERIOD. AND THEN WE CHECK THAT THEIR WAGE AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE WAGE PROGRESSION SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE IMPACT AT LEAST THE TRAINING AND THE RETENTION IS ON THAT SINCE WE'RE GONNA COLLECT THE BEFORE AND AFTER OF THAT WAGE. EXCELLENT BOOK OF ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT JOBS THERE IN WHEN YOU'RE PROVIDING THE TRAINING YES YES GOOD. GOOD ANYTHING THAT I FAILED TO ASK- I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT- WE ARE WORKING WITH YOU KNOW OUR OTHER LABOR AGENCIES IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE'VE BUILT A NEW- CONTRACTING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WITH HAVING IN HOUSE STAFF YOU KNOW WHO ARE BE ABLE TO MANIPULATE IT SO WE CAN COLLECT THAT DATA. COMPILED THAT DATA AND STRATEGICALLY PLAN. YOU KNOW FOR LOOKING AT WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS EACH FISCAL YEAR AND BEYOND THAT SO THAT WE CAN HELP THESE BUSINESSES AND THEIR TRAINING. THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR WE SHOULD CREATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO SPEND IT WITH US THIS AFTERNOON ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL. AND THE PANELS ENTITLED WAYS TO IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM EVALUATION AND PERFORMANCE REPORTING. IN OUR FIRST PANELIST IS RACHEL VILSACK SENIOR FELLOW NATIONAL SKILLS COALITION. THANK YOU SENATOR ROSS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE- AS YOU MENTION MY NAME IS RACHEL LITTLE SACK I'M A SENIOR FELLOW AT NATIONAL SKILLS COALITION WHICH IS A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN WASHINGTON DC THAT BUILDS NETWORKS REPRESENTING BUSINESSES WORKERS COLLEGES COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND ADVOCATES WHO BELIEVE THAT JOBS THAT REQUIRE HIGH QUALITY SKILLS TRAINING ARE CRITICAL IN HELPING MORE PEOPLE GAIN ACCESS TO A BETTER LIFE AND MORE BUSINESSES. SEE SUSTAINED GROWTH BY THE WAY THIS MIAMI. THANK YOU THIS PAST YEAR AND A HALF HAS MAGNIFIED THE NEED FOR ACCURATE TIMELY WORKFORCE DATA BOTH TO GUY DISPLACED WORKERS TOWARDS THE BEST QUALITY RETRAINING PROGRAMS AND TO ENSURE DATA INFORMED POLICY DECISIONS SUPPORT AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY TRADITIONAL LABOR MARKET SOURCES ARE BEING COUPLED WITH REAL TIME TOOLS TO ANALYZE THE SKILLS AND CREDENTIALS NEEDED IN FACTORS FACING SHORTAGES OF TRAINED WORKERS OR TOWARDS OCCUPATIONS WHERE A QUALITY CREDENTIAL PUTS INDIVIDUALS ON A CAREER PATHWAY TOWARDS A FAMILY SUSTAINING WAGE. NATIONAL SKILLS COALITION HAS BEEN WORKING WITH DOZENS OF STATES TO DEFINE QUALITY CREDENTIALS PARTICULARLY IN THE NON DEGREE OR NON CREDIT SPACE AS THE SHORT TERM PROGRAMS ARE SEEN BY WORKING ADULTS TO BE A FLEXIBLE ON RAMP TO RESKILLING FOR IN DEMAND JOBS AND STATES SEE NON DEGREE PROGRAMS IS A KEY COMPONENT TO REACH POST SECONDARY ATTAINMENT GOALS AND AS AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY RESPONSE TO RECONNECTING WORKING ADULTS TO FURTHER OUR SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. OPPORTUNITIES DATA ON JOB OPENINGS IN EMPLOYER FEEDBACK ON QUALITY CREDENTIALS IS EEDED- IN AND FOR THIS WORK A LOCAL INDUSTRY SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS ARE TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN SHAPING RETRAINING STRATEGIES TO MEET THEIR SKILLS NEEDS WHILE PROVIDING PATHWAYS. FOR WORKERS TO GET JOBS IN DEMAND. THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND HAVE NATURALLY HOWEVER EXPANDED DURING THE PANDEMIC TO SUPPORT EMPLOYERS WHO FACED SHORTAGES FOR FRONTLINE WORKERS AND THESE PARTNERSHIPS SHOULD EXPAND TO OTHER SECTORS WHO NEED SKILLED WORKERS. AND FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO WANT TO ADVANCE THE SKILLS OF THEIR EXISTING WORK FORCE TO RESPOND TO WORKPLACE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH. DIGITAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES MISTER RANEY SPOKE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS PARTICULARLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SH OBVIOUSLY ADMINISTRATIVE WAGE RECORDS SERVE AS A KEY RESOURCE FOR UNDERSTANDING OF PARTICIPANTS THE WORKFORCE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE FINDING EMPLOYMENT. AS MISTAKE NUMBER SHARED SOME STATES DO COLLECT ADDITIONAL ITEMS IN THEIR BASE WAGE FILES INCLUDING JOB TITLES LOCATION OF WORK AN HOUR'S WORK WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON ENHANCEMENT AMONG STATES. A QUARTERLY MEASUREMENTS OF ALL WORDS WORKS CAN ALLOW FOR THE CALCULATION OF AN HOURLY WAGE RATES AS WELL AS PART TIME AND FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT STATUS WHICH CAN BE A HELPFUL SIGNAL OF JOB QUALITY AS FULL TIME JOBS ARE MORE LIKELY TO OFFER BENEFITS. IN ADDITION REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO SUBMIT OCCUPATION OR JOB TITLES ON THEIR WAGE RECORDS CAN PROVIDE GREATER CONTEXT ON WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL DOES ON THE JOB THAN AN INDUSTRY CODE WHICH IS MOST COMMONLY IS USED TO SIGNIFY WHAT GOODS OR SERVICES A BUSINESS PRIMARILY ENGAGES IN CREATING OR PROVIDING. OUR MOST RECENTLY THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IS REQUESTING OCCUPATIONAL DATA FROM EMPLOYERS AS A PART OF THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REPORTING. THEIR LEGISLATIVE BILL EXPLAINS THAT THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MORE ACCURATE OCCUPATIONAL TREND ANALYSES AND MORE EFFECTIVE EVALUATIONS OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WHETHER IT'S NOT DAILY TO PARTICULAR OCCUPATIONS. I POINT OUT THAT WAGE RECORD ENHANCEMENTS MAY NOT HOWEVER PROVIDE ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT BIKE MIGHT BE NEEDED TO ASSESS CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRESSION IN WORK FORCE PROGRAM SUCCESS. CERTAINLY IT HELPS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WORK WELL AND ACHIEVE SUCCESS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS LIKE RECENT DISLOCATED WORKERS ARE LONG TERM UNEMPLOYED BUT THE DATA MAY NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO THE SKILLS THAT. EDUCATION CERTIFICATIONS AND WORK EXPERIENCE HELD BY INDIVIDUALS THAT INFLUENCE CAREER SUCCESS AND WHICH MIGHT BE OBTAINED OUTSIDE OF IMMEDIATE. OF THE IMMEDIATE WORK FORCE PROGRAM BEING MASURED HERE'S WHERE STATE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS CAN PLAY A ROLE IN SHOWING THAT EDUCATION TO WORK FORCE AN EDUCATION TO WORK FORCE. PROGRESSION THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY TAKE. AND THERE CERTAINLY ARE STANDARD CONCERNS OF DATA ERRORS TIMELINESS OF AVAILABLE DATA AND LIMITED DATA IF ANY ON THE OUTCOMES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HOLD A JOB COVERED BY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. NAMELY INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN CONTRACT OR GIG ROLES NORMAL OUTCOMES BE COMPLETE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE STATE UNLESS THOSE STATES TO REQUIRE SIMILAR WAGE RECORD ENHANCEMENTS. BY SENATOR I THINK YOU FOR UP LIFTING THE UNIQUE TIME WERE IN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR OPENING REMARKS WITH FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING AND REALLY THE NEED TO MEET NEW EMPLOYER DEMANDS AND DISSIPATED FROM. WHAT WILL BE AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. ALL PUBLIC DATA AND ACCOUNTABILITY ARE CRITICAL TO EVALUATING A FAR WORK FORCE YOU SKILLS TRAINING POLICY SUPPORTS AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY OR RECOVERY THAT RECOGNIZES. AND UP LIFTS WORKERS OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND WORKERS WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR LAST WHO HAVE SUFFERED DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS DURING THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF. AND WHO WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING RELATIVE TO OTHER WORKERS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC EVEN BEGAN. GOOD DATA CAN HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT IN TERMS OF CREATING GREATER ACCESS TO WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS AND REPORTING THE MEASURABLE ECONOMIC GAMES. CAREER ADVANCE CAREER PATHWAYS BUILD WEALTH AND EXPAND THE WELL BEING OF WORKERS SHARE DATA. SYSTEMS TOO ARE ARE CRITICAL TO INFORM DECISION MAKING AND BOTH DATA AND WELL DESIGNED SYSTEMS MUST ALSO BE CAPABLE OF TRACKING PROGRAM ACCESS. AND OUTCOMES MEASURED BY RACE ETHNICITY AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT ALLOW EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS BARRIERS FOR UNDER REPRESENTED PEOPLE OF COLOR ADDRESS ANY GAPS AND MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS CLOSING EQUITY GOALS. I'LL GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF MINNESOTA WHO REQUIRES DISAGGREGATED PERFORMANCE DATA ON STATE FUNDED WORKFORCE PROGRAMS BY RACE ETHNICITY GENDER GEOGRAPHY AGE EDUCATION AND HOUSING STATUS. THE REPUBLIC DASHBOARD LOCATED ON ITS DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WEBSITE. THE DASHBOARD NOT ONLY TRACKS OUTCOMES BY RACE BUT ALSO SOME SPECIFIC IMMIGRANT SUBGROUPS PREVALENT WITHIN THE STATE INCLUDING MOM IN SOMALI IMMIGRANTS. PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES IN CLUED SHORT MID LONG TERM EMPLOYMENT RETENTION FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED TRAINING OR NOT. AND ATTEND A CREDENTIAL OR NOT AS WELL AS PRE AND POST WAGE COMPARISONS REPORTING IS CODIFIED IN STATE STATUTE IT'S MADE POSSIBLE BY LEVERAGING PROGRAM DATA CAPTURED THROUGH A SINGLE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS USED BY ALL LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AREAS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO ADMINISTER FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDED WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS OF COURSE LINKING PROGRAM DATA TO ADMINISTRATIVE WAGE RECORDS. LASTLY AND FOR DATA TO BE USED EFFECTIVELY IN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS- OUTCOMES DATA ESPECIALLY DISAGGREGATED DATA MUST BE AVAILABLE TO LOCAL WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT AREAS WHERE THE SERVICE DELIVERY TAKES PLACE. NATIONAL SKILLS COALITION HEARS FROM LOCAL PRACTITIONERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT. ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT AND WAGE OUTCOMES FROM ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS FOR THE CUSTOMERS THEY SERVE IT'S OFTEN NOT AVAILABLE AND THEREFORE CAN'T BE USED TO ASSESS WHAT'S WORKING WELL OR NOT AT A LOCAL LEVEL. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE ONE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE OF EXPANDED. WORKFORCE REPORTING IS THE PRACTITIONER AND LOCALIZED INSIGHT THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO HELP CONTEXTUALIZE THE OUTCOMES THAT WERE SEEN IN THE DATA WELL THE MINNESOTA EXAMPLE I SURE DID NOT REQUIRE REPORTING ON FULL TIME OR PART TIME JOB STATUS IT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY. TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO DID NOT FULLY SEE THE SUCCESS OF THEIR WORKFORCE TRAINING EFFORTS THAT TOOK INDIVIDUALS FROM MULTIPLE LOWER PAYING PART TIME JOBS TO A FULL TIME JOB THAT OFFERED HIGHER WAGES AND BENEFITS. SO EXPANDED DATA COLLECTION AND PUBLIC REPORTING HAS ALLOWED STATES LIKE MINNESOTA TO MORE ACCURATELY MEASURE HOW THE PUBLIC WORKFORCE SYSTEM IS MEETING THE STATE'S EQUITY WORK FOR SCHOOLS. AND THESE EXPANDED PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS GAPS IN SERVICE DELIVERY. OUT WHETHER WORKFORCE PROGRAMS HELPED PARTICIPANTS ACHIEVE ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND INCOME GROWTH OVER TIME RATHER THAN PROMOTING A JOBS FIRST MENTALITY AND IF PROGRAMS OR PROVIDERS AREN'T DEMONSTRATING EFFECTIVENESS AND SHOULD CEASE TO BE FUNDED. AND I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS THERE LOOKS FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU I WAS GOING TO ASK. WHAT OTHER DATA POINTS MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO US BUT I THINK OF YOU. WOUND UP BY MENTIONING THOSE THE RACE HOUSING ISSUES CREDENTIAL OR NOT ITS CENTER IN OAKLAND THE LIST THAT YOU MENTIONED. AND I THOUGHT I CAUGHT YOU SAYING THAT IT WAS USED FOR DATA POINTS COLLECTED BY THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AND HOW HOW DID THAT WORK IN THE STATES THAT THAT HAVE HAPPENED. SO IN STATES WHERE ALL THIS WORK IS HAPPENING AGAIN I TEND TO USE MINNESOTA AS AN EXAMPLE HERE WHO'S REALLY ADVANCED PUBLIC REPORTING OF THESE OUTCOMES DATA. IS REALLY EMBODYING WHAT THE DATA BEING COLLECTED AT EITHER THAT LOCAL WORK FORCE LEVEL OR FROM THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH MINISTER. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS SO IT'S REALLY BUILT INTO A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS. A COMMON AND STANDARD DEFINITIONS FOR ALL OF THESE DATA ELEMENTS SO THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU CAN HAVE A PUBLIC FACING. OUR TOOL A REPORT CARD THAT'S COMPARING LIKE A DATA TO LIKE DATA. AND I REALLY UP LIFTED THE NEED TO DISAGGREGATE THIS INFORMATION. YOU KNOW BY THINGS LIKE RACE ETHNICITY GENDER- AND SO ON. BECAUSE IT IS THE RECOGNITION ALSO THAT DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SERVE DIFFERENT- POPULATIONS. AND THAT IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND USEFUL. AS A PART OF THAT PUBLIC REPORTING TO LOOK AT. AT WHO IS BEING SERVED AND WHAT PARTICULAR PROGRAMS AND OUR PROVIDERS ARE PRODUCING THE BEST RESULTS AND THE MOST YOU KNOW LABOR MARKET ALIGNED RESULTS FOR THE PARTICIPANTS THAT THEY'RE SERVING. IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS I GUESS MINNESOTA BEING ONE. WHERE THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS ACTUALLY TAKE A ROLE IN COLLECTING ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS BEYOND THE BASE WAGE FILE. HAVE YOU FOUND THAT THE BLOKE A WORK DEVELOPMENT BOARDS ARE ALREADY STAFFED FOR THIS SORT OF THE DUTY OR- HAS IT REQUIRED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE TO. IMPLEMENT THIS ADDITIONAL REPORTING. SO IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT FUNDING FOR DATA SYSTEMS ARE CHANGING CHANGES TO EXISTING SYSTEMS CAN BE FUNDAMENTAL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL EXPANSION OF A DATA ACCESS AND OUTCOMES REPORTING- I THINK WHERE IT IS OFTEN SEEN IS IN THE COMMUNICATION THAT IS REALLY NEEDED WHETHER IT'S AT THAT LOCAL WORKFORCE BOARD LEVEL OR AGAIN THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION WHOSE IMPLEMENTING OR PARTICIPATING IN A STATE FUNDED GRANT PROGRAM. SO THIS THIS OFTEN- CAN TAKE THE EMPHASIS OF STAFF TRAINING AND ONGOING TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH WORK FORCE TRAINING PROVIDERS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WILL BE HOW THIS DATA IS MEASURED AND USED AND I WOULD ALSO ADD INSURING THAT CUSTOMERS BEING SERVED TO KNOW WHAT DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS ARE BEING COLLECTED ABOUT THEM HOW THEIR DATA ARE BEING USED TO MEASURE. THEIR LONG TERM EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES SO IN SOME CASES THERE MAY BE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AROUND- PRIVACY DISCLOSURES THAT CUSTOMERS FIND AS THEY PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WERE. REPORTING THEM AND THEIR OUTCOMES IN A WAY IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY AND I ASSUME SINCE THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL DUTY THIS STATE FUNDING WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER AND HAS BEEN RECORDED IN THOSE STATES THAT HAVE DONE IT IN ORDER FOR THIS TO HAPPEN RIGHT. YES IT IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL AGAIN TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES TO EXISTING SYSTEMS AND TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW THAT ADDITIONAL NEED FOR STAFF TRAINING AND ONGOING TECHNICAL SUPPORT AT LEAST IN AN INTERIM BASIS. R. AS THESE EXPANDED PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE BEING FUNDED I WOULD ALSO SAY TO THE DEGREE THAT THESE. TOOLS ARE BEING MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FUNDING OR SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THEIR UPDATED ROUTINELY AND THAT INFORMATION IS ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE PUBLIC AUDIENCE. AND BEING- SHARED AND COMMUNICATED WITH YOU KNOW LEGISLATORS AND OTHER SKILLED ADVOCATES WITHIN THE STATE IT CERTAINLY OUGHT ONE CONSIDERATION AS WELL. AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD ENLIGHTEN US AS TO. WHAT IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND POTENTIAL COSTS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE STATES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED THIS ENHANCED LABOR MARKET REPORT INFORMATION REPORTING. YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THIS IS WHERE STATES HAVE ALSO TAKEN OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH OUR PARTICIPATION WITH NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE NATIONAL SKILLS COALITION OF WHO WHO REALLY AND WE DO WORK WITH STATES THROUGH POLICY ACADEMIES TO ADVANCE THIS WORK SO IT IS ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER OFF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT EXIST TO SUPPORT. THIS THIS EXPANDED AT WORK DATA REPORTING AND DATA COLLECTION AS WELL SO THAT HAS BEEN ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT STATES HAVE LOOKED TOWARDS TO SUPPLEMENT AND SUPPORT THIS WORK WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FEDERAL OF FUNDING GRANTS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO EXPAND IN A WORK FORCE IN EDUCATION DATA LINKAGES AUSTIN LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEMS OR THROUGH THE SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO CAN PROVIDE. RESOURCES AND FEEDBACK ON HOW TO DO THIS AND IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY AND IN OTHER STATES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DOING THIS SOME OF THE PROCESS THE ENHANCED PROCESS HE'S BEEN GOING ON LONG ENOUGH SO THAT REPORTS HAVE BEEN GENERATED SO SOMEONE LIKE ME COULD PULL A REPORT FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON OR SOME OTHER STATE TO ACTUALLY SEE THE IMPACT OF HAVING ENHANCED DATA. ON MEASURING THE EFFECTIVENESS SON OF CAREER TECH EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE. SURE THERE ARE CERTAINLY SOME STATES WHO HAVE- YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF DATA I GO BACK TO THE MINNESOTA EXAMPLE MINNESOTA SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN HAS MADE AVAILABLE THIS INFORMATION SO LONGITUDINALLY- THE STATE AGENCY- AND LEGISLATORS CAN LOOK AT. HOW VARIOUS PROGRAMS ARE ARE REALLY IMPACTING AND INFLUENCING THE STATE'S WORKFORCE GOALS PARTICULARLY AROUND EQUITY. THERE ARE OTHER STATES WHO ARE JUST BEGINNING THIS WORK AD THERE WAS A PANELIST EARLIER WHO REFERENCE TO THE ELIGIBLE TRAINING PROVIDER LIST WHICH IS USED BY WYO WAY PARTICIPANTS OUGHT TO SELECT TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF WORK WITH STATES OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON. ADVANCING THE QUALITY AND EQUITY IN THEIR STATES ELIGIBLE TRAINING PROVIDER LIST AND SO WE'LL START SEEING THE BENEFITS OF SOME OF THOSE STATES COME TO FRUITION. IN THE NEXT YEAR. AND WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACT ON TRAINING PROGRAMS ONCE THE ACTUALLY THE ENHANCED DATA WAS AVAILABLE AND- ANALYSED WHAT IMPACT ON THE ON THE ACTUAL TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WERE IN. PLACE AT THE TIME. OCCURRED IF YOU CAN TALK IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT. SO I'LL GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF STATES WHO ARE REALLY LOOKING. AT THIS DATA THROUGH THEIR ELIGIBLE TRAINING PROVIDER LISTS WE ARE SEEN STATES IN NEW JERSEY IS A RECET EXAMPLE WHO WILL REALLY BE EVALUATING TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR WYO A FUNDING TO TRAIN. OUR TITLE ONE INDIVIDUALS AND THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE STARTING TO REMOVE OUR TRAINING PROVIDERS WHO DON'T MEET THE QUALITY ASSURANCE STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. WHICH ALSO INCLUDE- DISAGGREGATION OF DATA BY RACE ETHNICITY AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND SO- THAT'S CERTAINLY IS ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT STATES ARE TAKING TO- SAY THAT YOU KNOW TRAINING PROGRAMS WON'T RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING ANY LONGER TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IF THEIR OUTCOMES. ARE A BELOW A CERTAIN THRESHOLD. BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE YET MAYBE IN MINNESOTA. TO SEE WHAT PROGRAMMATIC SAVINGS RESULTED FROM THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF THIS ENHANCED DATA REPORTING TO ACTUALLY TRY TO MAKE THE LINES CROSS BETWEEN JOB TRAINING AND- JOBS THAT- WERE SECURED- I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SORT OF DATA IS AVAILABLE IN THE REPORTING BUT IF NOT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT WHEN IT IS. IN THE- DISH AT EVERY TURN ON INVESTMENT DATA WOULD CERTAINLY BE RELEVANT HERE AND I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THERE ARE STATES WHO ARE ADVANCING- THE WORK ON EVALUATING WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS MINNESOTA ALSO HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF THOSE STATES. ARE REALLY USING AND LEVERAGING PROGRAM PARTICIPATION DATA AGAINST COMPARISON GROUPS TO SHOW WHAT THE IMPACT AND WHAT ACTUALLY IS THE PUBLIC- BENEFITS AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THE LONG TERM. EXCELLENT VERY ENLIGHTENING THAT I FAILED TO ASK SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD HAVE THEM. YOU DIDN'T THIS IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN FOR TAKING YOUR TIME. OUR NEXT PANELIST DISMISSED STEVE SAXTON CONSULTANT TO T. THREE INNOVATION NETWORK. THERE WE GO GOOD AFTERNOON THERE YOU ARE THANK YOU SIR FOR JOINING US THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WELL AS YOU'VE CERTAINLY HEARD TODAY THERE'S LOTS OF INTERESTING AMOUNT BETTER INFORMATION YOURSELF CENTER OF EXPRESS THAT DESIRE TO HELP. MUCH MORE IN DEPTH INFORMATION. FOR WORKFORCE PURPOSES. BARBARA BUT- TWO MINUTES EARLY TO DISCUSS A STEP FROM THAT AND TALK ABOUT JUST HOW BROAD THE INTEREST GOES IN THIS KIND OF INFORMATION. CERTAINLY ALL STATES ARE INTERESTED IN AND BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR TRAINING PARTICIPANTS BUT- MR MILLER SHARE US SURE SOME FLOODS HERE A KIND OF LEAD YOU. MAYBE FROM THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL BACK DOWN INTO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. WHAT MADE NUMEROUS. THERE WE GO OKAY GOOD OUT HERE. FIRST IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE IN THE LIGHTWEIGHT RECORDS HELLO THE CORE ELEMENTS NAME SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND TOTAL WAGES THAT ARE REPORTED BY ALL FIFTY THREE JURISDICTIONS THAT OPERATED MEDICAL INSURANCE PROGRAM. WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO MENTION SOME STATES. ANOTHER JURISDICTION TRAILS ONE OF THOSE DATA. OVER MANY YEARS WASHINGTON WHICH WILL BE THE FIRST STATE TO DO THAT BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HOURS OF WORK BACKGROUND. IT OVER TIME MORGAN ADDED ALASKA IN OCCUPATION AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE NINEEEN NINETIES. OVER WITH WE CONTINUALLY THAT AND MORE AND MORE AND DO NOT NECESSARILY NEED ORGANIZED FOR ACTION. HELLO IT IS GROWN IN FACT WOMEN STREET NOW COLLECTS DATA- MONTHLY WAGE RECORDS MONTHLY DATA MAKES EXPRESSLY DID THAT TO PROVE THE FLORIDA TEXAS A PURPOSE FOR PROTECTION PURPOSES. LET'S CONTINUE. IN ABOUT THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN ORIGIN SHOULD CALL THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT COUNSEL OR HAVE SERVED ON PRIOR TO THAT. I DECIDED TO DO A STUDY JUST WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES. FOR ENHANCING WHAT DIRECTIONS. AND SO WE LOOKED AT LIKE WE CONSULTANT CROWD. WE LOOKED WE TALKED TO EMPLOYERS WE TALKED TO% HAD RULE SERVICE PROVIDERS WE TALKED STRAIGHT YOU WIND UP RATIONS WE TALKED TO GOVERNMENT STATISTICAL AGENCIES. TO FIND OUT WHAT THE POSSIBILITIES WERE AND WHAT THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WERE. TO ENHANCING. THOSE WAGE RECORD SO WE HAD BETTER INFORMATION. YEAH COUPLE NUMBER FOR ISSUE. THE FORTY TO FIFTEEN THINGS I THINK PALE MENTION ONE A LITTLE EARLIER TODAY. HE TALKED ABOUT HOW SOME OF THOSE DATA WERE WERE BEING USED COULD BE USED. YEAH WE CAN WE CAN ALL THE NUMBER RECOMMENDATIONS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND- COUPLE REPORTER WANTS TO BE ANYWHERE AND WORK ONE WE NEED BETTER COLLABORATION IN DOING THAT SO THAT WE HELLO. COMPARABLE INFORMATION ZERO THERE'S AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN INSTITUTION WANTS TO FOLLOW TRAINING PROVIDERS. BUT IT WAS STRIPPED OF PROTECTIONS WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T STAY IN THE LOCAL AREA EIGHT THREE WE WERE ON THE STREET AT THE GULF STATES WE STILL WANT TO KNOW ARE THE ONES OF THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR UNCLES. AND SO IF WE DON'T COLLECT THE SAME INFORMATION. IN THE SAME MANNER. ROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT WE'RE NOT BE ABLE TO DO FOR A SECOND LET. AND THE OTHER PART OF THAT WAS BUT THE STANDARDS. WE HAVE WE STUDENTS- VERY STRONG OF ENHANCEMENTS TO THEIR WAGE. BUT THEY- THEY MIGHT CALL THE SORT OF WITH THE IT DOES. EXAMPLE BE ORDER I WANT BOTH COLLECT HOURS WORKED ONE INCLUDES THE CLEVELAND THEIR HOURS WORKED THE OTHER DOES NOT INCLUDE STRICTLY COME OUT. SO YOU CAN'T REALLY. COMPARE THOSE TO DIRECTLY. SO GENERALIZATION IN COLLABORATION. ORGANIZATIONS WORK TOGETHER TO DECIDE WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT HELD UP SHOULD WE- BUT WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING. WELL I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CAME OUT OF THAT STUFF- FOLLOWING THAT WE MOSTLY WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT NEED A LITTLE MORE PRECIPITATION COUNCIL WHERE- WAS DISBANDED AND WE KNEW WHAT WORKFORCE INFORMATION ADVISORY COUNCIL WAS FORMED- IT WAS A BROADER BASED ADVISORY COUNCIL TO THE SECRETARY OF LABOR ABOUT. THE WORKFORCE INFORMATION SYSTEM. YEAH PLEASE A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THEY WERE FOUNDED IN. TWO THOUSAND SO X. MEDICAL AGO CONDITION THE SECRETARY BUT FIRST RECOMMENDATION I MADE WAS. ENHANCE THE WAY DIRECTIVES. CONTINUE THEIR CONTINUED TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE RECOGNITIONS. THE SAME TIME IF THAT HAPPENS HELLO THE U. S. CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOUNDATION. INITIATED ANY OF THE T. THREE INNOVATION NETWORK QUESTION. ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS. THE AND WE WORK WITH THE PICTURE OPEN STANDARDS CONSORTIUM TO. LOOK AT HOW THE TALENT MARKETPLACE COULD BE IMPROVED. NEW TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH BETTER COLLABORATION. ONE OF THEIR PROJECTS- LOOK AT ALL ASPECTS OF THE TELEMARK ONE ASPECT WAS WAS THE DATA INFRASTRUCTURE AT. I WAS PART OF THE PROJECT TEAM THAT WORKED ON INCLUDED EARNINGS DATA TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF DATA ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S AVAILABLE WHAT'S NEEDED WHO'S WHO NEEDS. WHICH KINDS OF DATA. FINALLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHICH MORE LATER A LOT OUT OF THAT. THE THREE ANIMATION AT WORK PROJECT A NEW INITIATIVE HAS BEEN STARTED BY THE US CHAMBER FOUNDATION WHICH IS CALLED JACKSON JOBS EMPLOYMENT DATA EXCHANGE WHAT'S GOING TO BE SOME UPCOMING EVENTS THAT I THINK THIS GROUP MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN. BASED ON THE- JUNE FIRST. WE TO. A HIGH LEVEL DO ALL THE DATA WE COULD FIND OUT WHO WANTS TO IMPLEMENT AN EARNINGS DATA THIS IS THIS IS A SUBSAMPLE OF SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ASKING FOR EMPLOYMENT AND EARNINGS DATA. SO THERE'S- ALMOST FIFTY. RIGHT HERE INCLUDES DOWN HERE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE COIN INSURANCE MONTHLY. AND QUARTERLY REPORTS AND NATIONAL DIRECTORY OF NEW HIRES BOTH OF THOSE ARE OPERATED BY THOSE FIFTY THREE JURISDICTIONS. NEW LIFE PROGRAMS. A LITTLE BIT. WE FOUND OVER TWO HUNDRED. VERY ABEL'S THERE COLLECTED UNEMPLOYMENT AND EARNINGS. AND WE WORK WITH THE- UP HR OPEN STANDARDS CONSORTIUM WHICH IS A CONSORTIUM OF. ALL PROVIDERS EHR SOFTWARE PROVIDERS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO SET STANDARDS ON PARTICULAR THERE EXCHANGING WHAT THEY HAVE TO EXCHANGE DATA ON. REAL TIME BASIS BECAUSE ONE- SOFTWARE PROVIDER MAY DO THE TABLE. MODULE THAT FORD EXPLORER ANOTHER COMPANY MAY DO THE OTHER H. R. MODULE. AND THOSE MODULES HAVE TO COMMUNICATE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH COMPLEX CHANGE DATA ON A REAL TIME BASIS. SO THEY HAVE STANDARDS IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT IT MEANS ASK FOR PARTICULAR pGOING TO GET EXACTLY WHAT THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING. TO GET. SO WE TOOK ALL THAT INFORMATION OFFICER. IN LOOKING. THIS IS ACTUALLY FROM A MORE RECENT STUDY. THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS AT WHAT. EARLIER WAS MENTIONED SOME OF THINGS OTHER STATES WERE DOING. I JUST FINISHED AN INVENTORY FOR A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION. HELLO ALL FIFTY THREE JURISDICTIONS THESE ARE THE KINDS OF DATA THESE ARE THE KINDS OF DATA ELEMENTS THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED RIGHT NOW ON YOUR WAY SO THERE'S INSTRUCTIONS ON ONE ORGANIZATION HAS THE EMPLOYEE'S ADDRESS. NO THE DRIP GOOD WRITTEN STREET NUMBER. CITY STATE. ZIP CODE IS THE FOUR VARIABLES HELLO BUT THERE'S A WHOLE NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH COMPENSATION DEMOGRAPHICS. RACIAL IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION LIKE. THE BILLING SERVER IS WORKING ON A RECENT. PAID TIME. OR WE CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR. HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING WITH HILL VARIOUS KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT COMPENSATION. I COULD TALK MORE ABOUT- ALMOST. WHAT WE SAW WHEN WE DID WITH THIS YOU HAVE ALMOST TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT REPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY GOT THE FIFTY THREE YOU ARE GORGEOUS FIFTY THREE YOU ARE OUR RECORDS AND A WHOLE SLEW OF FEDERAL. DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS THE MINISTRY OKAY AND STATISTICAL. WE'VE GOT A TREMENDOUS VARIATION IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF REPORTS AS THAT NUMBER GROWS IS THE VOLUME OF THE CUBE IT WALL STREET'S. THE WORKLOAD THE COST FOR THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY GROWS GEOMETRICALLY. YEAH SO WHAT WE WERE TRUCK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE PULL-THIS BACK IN A LITTLE BIT HOW CAN WE REDUCE SOME OF THAT RADIATION WHICH NUMBER OF PORTS. SO THAT. WE CAN GET MORE BANG FOR THE BUCK. WHICH PULLS DATA- HELLO WORKING WITH THE CHIEF DATA ARCHITECT FROM EATING PIZZA LARGE MINERAL PROCESSING FIRM. WELL WE GOT THIS HIGH LEVEL CONCEPTUAL MODEL WHICH COULD DISH DESCRIBES DISPLAYS THE TYPES OF INFORMATION. THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED NOW AND HOW THEY'RE STORED IN EMPLOYER SYSTEM SO- LEFTY EITHER H. R. SYSTEM. WE'LL LET YOU SEE THE TIME LABOR SYSTEM WILL SYSTEM UNTIL YOU HELD THIS KIND OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION'S MISSION GOT JOBS PHYSICIANS IN. ESTABLISHMENTS THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS FEDERAL. IMMIGRATION INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE WORLD A WORKER IN A RELATIONSHIP. WITH THAT WORKER HAS WITH THE ORGANIZATION. THE WORK IS. HELLO COMING OUT OF ALL THAT YOUR MOTHER TOOK THE TIME THAT THEY PUT IT ON. HOW MUCH THEY'RE COMPENSATED FOR THAT TIME PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY WORK AGAINST. HERE'S WE CREATED A DATA DICTIONARY THAT INSURE BECAUSE OF STRANGERS CONSORTIUM HAS ADOPTED THEIR MEMBERSHIP. REVIEW THAT AND ISN'T A DOCTOR THE DATA DICTIONARY SO THAT THEY HAVE A STANDARDIZED SET OF. DEFINITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLES THAT WERE WERE COLLECTING. YOU CAN SEE CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THE DICTIONARY AND I WATCHED IT FALLS WITHIN THE DATA DICTIONARY. EARLIER WAS NOT. QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT'S RIGHT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE CAPTURED IN THIS DATABASE THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF WORKERS THAT ARE CAPTURED IN THIS DATABASE. TRADITIONAL EMPLOYEES CONTRACTORS INTERIM POLICE OR THIRD PARTY LAWYERS AND THEN VOLUNTEERS SO THERE'S YOU CAN ISOLATE INFORMATION ABOUT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THIS THE STATEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S IN THERE FOR THE ORGANIZATION FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE. THE NUMBER OF. FROM EXPECTED THINGS TO TELL TELL YOU ABOUT THE FIRM. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT PAID TIME BECAUSE TOTAL HOURS PAID WHICH IS COMPRISED OF TOTAL HOURS WORKED IN TOTAL HOURS OF PAID TIME OFF. YOU ALSO HAVE A WEEK'S WORK AND WHETHER OR NOT AN INDIVIDUAL WORKS THE PAPER INCLUDES THE TWELFTH OF THE MONTH WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF STATISTICAL SECTION. TOTAL COMPENSATION MADE UP OF TOTAL CASH TOTAL NON CASH COMPENSATION IS IN CASH. SORRY WHICH IS A RELIGION'S LEAVE PAID OTHER CASH COMPENSATION LIKE COMMISSIONS. OR BONUSES OR PEACE WORKER. THIS IS THIS IS A HIGH LEVEL THERE'S MANY MANY VARIABLES WITHIN EACH ONE OF THESE THINGS. WE THOUGHT SORT OF THINKING ABOUT HOW HOW WE'RE DOING THIS NOW IN THIS GROUP WE HAVE. A LOT OF THE COLLECTION THAT KIND OF REFLECTS WHAT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS. ALL WE'RE LEFT BUT CERTAINLY NOT ALL NOT TOWARDS THE RIGHT. OUR BELIEF IS THAT THE FARTHER YOU GO TO WAR RIGHT. THE LOWER YOUR COSTS LOWER MARGINAL COSTS IS GOING TO BE A HIGHER VALUE. SO WE WORK TOGETHER WE- YOU CAN FIND WAYS OF COLLECTING DATA. ANSWER MULTIPLE PURPOSES. WE CAN GET POPULATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE BETTER DATA. AT A LOWER OVERALL COST. THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH YEAH RIGHT IT RESIDUAL ONE BETTER DATA WE'RE GETTING. DATA DATA PORTS HEALTH DATA NOT MANY THAT'S WHERE THEIR BUSINESSES THE REPORTING IT TO VARIOUS DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT ENTITIES RECORDING IT WAY TOO MUCH- BUT THEY HAVE THE DATA ALEX JUST COST THEM A LOT AND IS ONE THING TO TRY OUT. EARLY STUDYING TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN WAS TALKING TO THE. NATIONAL PAYROLL RECORDED CONSORTIUM. OUR THIS IS THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK EMPLOYERS THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY THE VOLUME OF DATA THAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT'S THE VARIATION SO BECAUSE THERE ARE FIFTY THREE DIFFERENT. YOU ARE SYSTEMS IN NEW HIRE SYSTEMS ON SIXTY RAINY FEDERAL SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE TO CUSTOMIZE THE COURTS EVERY TIME THEY LOOK MORE. THAT HAS TO COST. SO THEY WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO STANDARDIZE CENTRALIZE AGREE CAN. THE DATA COLLECTION. QUICKLY HELLO THIRTEEN COSTS- HELLO TRYING TO IMPROVE THE YES THE SYSTEM FOR THIS WORK. PARTNERS OR STAKEHOLDERS. BUT THERE IS A VARIETY OF REPORTS THAT ARE OUT THERE FROM VARIOUS STUDIES THAT IF ANYBODY'S INTERESTED. WE HAVE A DENTURE ALL THIS INFORMATION SO. WITH THAT I'M GONNA DROP THIS OFF BUT CERTAINLY HASN'T QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK ABOUT ANY OF US. HELLO WHERE ARE WE WITH THIS I MEAN I ASSUME THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE WELL THAT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION HELLO. THE REPORT CAME OUT OF THE- TWO THREE NETWORK CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY FOLLOWING THAT DO YOU. WE MUST CHAMBER FOUNDATION- A DECISION TO INITIATE THIS JEFF EXPONENTIALLY JOHNSON QUOTED EXCHANGE- WHICH FORMED A- FIVE THREE COMMITTEE. MANY NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED INDIVIDUALS ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE TO RISE HOW TO HOW TO PROCEED. NOT OF THAT CHAMBER RECOMMENDATION REPORT. THAT SHOULD OPERATE TWO DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THE TRUTH THIS IS POSSIBLE. AND SO IN THE AREA OF THIS. WINTERTON HAS LEARNED TO JUST IMPLEMENT EARNINGS DATA- THERE WILL BE A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WILL BEGIN. EUROPE THREE MONTHS- STATES HAVE BEEN ASKED FOR THEIR INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING. IRAN DOES DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WORK HELLO THE JOINT PARTICIPATION OF STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FEDERAL PROCESSING SOFTWARE INDUSTRY EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHAT SHOULD BE COLLECTED AND HOW SHOULD BE COLLECTED. AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE OWNERSHIP WAS ANOTHER GROUP THAT YOU'LL BE TALKING. WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGICAL WAYS TO SHARE INFORMATION WITH SOMEONE SHE WOULD PAY ROLL INDUSTRY. I WAS PRETTY EFFICIENT WAYS OF EXCHANGING INFORMATION QUICKLY. THEY WILL BE INVOLVED HIM TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE BEST TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS WE CAN LOWER THE- COST OF DELIVERING INFORMATION SHARING INFORMATION AND THE SAME TIME. HENCE THE TYPES OF INFORMATION BETTER PROGRAM. WELL I'M JUST CURIOUS IS DID CALIFORNIA INDICATED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING WITH YOU IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM. WELL IT THE CHAMBER IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE- STATES WHO HELD. EXPRESSED AN INTEREST VERY SHORTLY HERE NEXT WEEK OR TWO THERE WILL BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT COMING ON I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO JUMP THE GUN ON THEIR HOUSE. BUT IT COULD KILL FORTY WANTS TO. PRESENT IT THE NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY. THINKS ABOUT. TO THE BUT WELL WE'LL WAIT FOR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT BUT I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES AND I'LL HAVE SEVERAL COLLEAGUES IT'LL BE INTERESTED IN HEARING THE ANSWERS SO WE'LL WE'LL STAY TUNED. IT'S I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE. I THINK WE HAVE SEPARATE STATES. THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW BUT WE'RE WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT HOW HOW TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS. YEAH LIKE I SAID WE GOT THOSE WE'VE GOT FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT ARE VERY INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. FOLLOW ME ON THE COMPUTER COMMUNITY THIS IS HOW IT IS INDICATED BY THE FACT THAT US CHAMBERS. FOUNDATION. IS BEHIND US. VERY INTERESTED IN FINDING WAYS TO GET BETTER- WORKFORCE ANALYTICS. I THINK YOU'RE SEEING SOME OF THAT IN. WHAT IS IT LIKE A DEEP CREEK LAKE THE SERVER HIGH PERCENTAGE OF- BOOK EXPLORERS AND ONE IN THE COUNTRY WELL THEY'RE STARTING TO GENERATE THEIR OWN. STATISTICAL INFORMATION BASED ON JUST WHAT THEY HAVE SO THAT EVERY MONTH I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN WHAT THEY PUT OUT THEIR OWN JOBS REPORT A FEW DAYS BEFORE YOUR LIKES DISLIKES. THEY'RE THEY'RE COLLECTING AND BEGINNING TO GENERATE WORKFORCE ANALYTICS BASED ON JUST WHAT THEY. HAVE ON IT AND THEY'D LOVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO. ALL THE OTHER FIRMS DATED SO QUICKLY FIND WHAT. ALL THAT. THE IT WILL IT WILL BE A VERY RICH SOURCE. OF COURSE THIS IS YOU KNOW I USED I SAY BY THE ENTRANCE TO SENSE BY THE YARD IT'S HARD OF COURSE. COMING TO SOME AGREEMENT ON THE STRUCTURE IS- HALF THE BATTLE OF COURSE. I'M SURE THE OTHER. PIECE OF THIS WILL BE FUNDING THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. BUT IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY TO. HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS ACROSS STATE LINES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOUNDRIES AS WELL SO I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS OUT BUT- IT SOUNDS PROMISING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO. STEVE ON THIS MATTER ANYTHING ELSE. PRECIADO VERY MUCH YOU TAKING THE TIME TO BE WITH US AND YOUR EFFORT IN TRYING TO. BRING ABOUT SOME ORDER TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE. A STATE OF DISORDER AT LEAST WITH TWO HUNDRED REPORTS IN A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS AT THEM. WE NEED TO SOMEHOW GET ORGANIZED SO WE GET THE USEFUL DATA THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE TRAINING PROGRAMS- AND FOR OTHER REASONS- IN THIS FIELD SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE POINTS THEY MENTIONED THE INVENTORY OF STATE YOU ARE A SYSTEM THAT THAT REPORT SHOULD BE COMING OUT FROM THE- LABOR MARKET INFORMATION WAS JUNE- HERE IN THE- NEXT FEW WEEKS AS WELL. NOT JUST ONE NO MORE SO THE NUMBERS FOR YOU. RIGHT NOW ALL. YOU LOOK AT THE NON CORE DATA LEMENTS. THIRTY EIGHT STATES FOR COLLECTING SEVENTY FOUR DIFFERENT. DATA ELEMENTS ALL YOUR DRIVES. SO IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY EXTENSIVE- CANCEL IT ALREADY HAPPENED BUT AGAIN IT'S VERY FOREIGN LANGUAGE THE FOLLOWING VERY INCONSISTENT. AND WE'RE NOT SO WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR APPRECIATE YOUR HELP WHAT OUR NEXT PANELIST DESERVES TO TELL MEN WAECHTER PRESS PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES DIRECTOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CAN YOU HEAR ME PERFECTLY. WE THANK THANK YOU SOUND THE ROUGH WEATHER INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS I'M ABOUT TO MAKE HAVE COME UP- SO I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF AND I SHOULD SAY MY- THIRD CHILD IS A COUPLE OF WEEKS OLD- SO I HAVE SOME NOTES TO KEEP ME ON TRACK- LET ME START WITH THE BOTTOM LINES. ENHANCING THAT YOU I. BASE WAGE FILED THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SPACE WHICH FILE. I COLLECTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS OCCUPATION. HOURS AND WEEKS WORK THE LOCATION OF WORK AND BASIC-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. IT'S VERY CLEAR BENEFITS FOR WORKERS. EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE. AND THE CHANGES BROUGHT BY DURING THE PANDEMIC AN ONGOING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE LED THE EFFORT TO ENHANCE THE WHITE BASS REG FILE SOME URGENCY. AND THE GOOD NEWS I THINK IS THAT OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE. I HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. OUT FOR DECADES YOU I BASICALLY FIND HAVE BEEN THE BACKBONE OF ANY EVALUATION OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THESE DATA PROVIDE INVALUABLE AND TIMELY INFORMATION ON QUARTERLY EMPLOYMENT AND EARNINGS THAT ALLOW REALLY DETAILED INSIGHTS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA IN SUCH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION WOULD NEARLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THE OTHER DATA SOURCES. HOWEVER YOU KNOW AS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE CURRENT ELEMENTS ARE VERY COARSE AND IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL IMITATIONS WHAT WE CAN LEARN TO GIVE YOU A SENSE FOR EACH EMPLOYEE THE BASS REG FILES CURRENTLY CONTAIN ONLY TOTAL QUARTERLY EARNINGS. AT EACH EMPLOYER. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE THE EXISTING BASE WHICH FILE IS A PRODUCT OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES. SO THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT THE AVAILABLE DATA REALLY GIVES THE IDEAL FOUNDATION ON WHICH TO BUILD A DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT RISES TO THE CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME. AND I'M GONNA GO GOING TO FOCUS ON FOR DATA ELEMENTS. THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY ENHANCE THE WHITE BASE WHICH FILE AND WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT. PERSON TO PATIENT THE SECOND IS HOURS AND WEEKS WORK THE THIRTIES PLACE OF WORK. AND THE FOURTH IS BASIC WORKER DEMOGRAPHICS. THESE FOUR ELEMENTS. HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTED AT MANAGEABLE COSTS IN OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY WOULD REALLY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS EMPLOYERS AND THE STATE OF THE WHOLE RIGHT THEY WOULD FURTHER IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATION SYSTEM. DID THEY WERE ALLOWED TO BETTER TRACK DEVELOPING OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS A WHOLE BUT ALSO DOWN TO THE FINE GRAINED LOCAL LEVEL. AND THEY WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF KEY REGULATIONS IN THE LABOR MARKET SUCH AS THAT MINIMUM WAGE. AND THEY WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS SERVICES FOR THE UNEMPLOYED. I WILL GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE ON THESE PROPOSED FOR DATA ELEMENTS. FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF AN EXPERT. IN LABOR ECONOMICS I I'VE SPENT OVER TWENTY YEARS DOING RESEARCH. AND GIVING POLICY ADVICE BASED ON ADMINISTRATIVE RUNNING STAFF IN CALIFORNIA AND THE U. S. AND FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. AND ASKED HIM KIND MEANT KINDLY MENTIONED. AT THE OUTSET I ALSO KOHLI DEVALUATION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS PARTICIPATING. IN THE CALCULUS STUDENT FOR STRUCTURE. NOW DECADES OF RESEARCH VERY CLEARLY TO THE NEED TO ADD THE FOUR DATA ELEMENTS I MENTIONED TO THE BASE WAGE FILES AND I BELIEVE THE CASE FOR ADDING EACH OF THESE DATA ELEMENTS IS ACTUALLY VERY STRONG NOW CONSIDER FIRST THE CASE FOR MEASURING HOURS AND WEEKS WORKED AS WELL AS A NEW PATIENT. MEASURING HOURS. WEEKLY HOURS WORKED WOULD ALLOW ONE TO INFER THE EFFECTIVE HOURLY WAGE RATE FOR EACH WORKER. THAT'S CRUCIAL BECAUSE HOURLY WAGES ARE ROUTINELY USED BY CONDOMS TO MEASURE HOW PRODUCTIVE WORKERS ARE AND WHAT A GOOD JOB AS- AS A RESULT ALI WAGES ARE USING EMPIRICAL WORK ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IN MANY DISCIPLINES. TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. IN A SIMILAR FASHION OCCUPATION IT IS A KEY INPUT AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL AT PLACING WORKERS INTO BETTER JOBS IT RAISING LIVING STANDARDS AND A GENERATING A HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE WORKFORCE. HELP WITHOUT INFORMATION ON HOURS AND A FEW PATIENTS IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FULLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM. BUT I DO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR DRESS ADDRESSES THE MANY CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC BUT THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK. AMONG OTHERS. OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND THE MANY AGENCIES PROVIDING EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN CALIFORNIA WORK VERY HARD EVERY DAY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS TRAINING SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. THE POINT HERE IS THAT INFORMATION HOURS OKAY PATIENT. AS WELL AS THE OTHER DATA MANAGEMENT THAT I MENTIONED WOULD REALLY HELP. WITH THAT PROCESS RIGHT WITH THESE DATA WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. ACTUALLY IMPROVE JOB QUALITY. WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHETHER SOME PROGRAMS WORK BETTER FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS AND OTHERS. EITHER BY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS ARE BY. LOCAL ECONOMIES AND WE CAN THEN USE THIS INFORMATION TO BETTER TARGET EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS ACROSS THEM A GRAPHIC GROUPS AND LOCAL LABOR MARKETS. HOURS WORKED AND OCCUPATION ALSO GREATLY HELPED ENHANCE THE VALUE OF EXISTING. DATA INVESTMENT THAT REALLY HAVE IMPROVED WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR MARKETS YOU'RE SUCH A SNACK. CAL SKILLS DATA FOR THE CROWN TO CAREER DATA INFRASTRUCTURE. I BELIEVE WE TURN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO OTHER DATA ELEMENTS I MENTIONED WHICH IS LOCATION OF WORKS AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. AS SENATOR ROTH HAS HELPED TO ZOOM IN ON QUITE BITTER POLITICALLY FOR SOME OF US IS THAT SUCH INFORMATION INFORMATION ON PLACE OF WORK. WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE LOCALLY. AS THE LABOR MARKET IS CHANGING AT THE END OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND DIFFERENCES BY LOCAL LABOR MARKET AND BY DEMOGRAPHIC RECORDS. CHARACTERISTICS WHAT WE CURRENTLY KNOW. COMMUNITIES WITH MORE BLACK RESIDENTS MORE HISPANIC RESIDENT RESIDENTS AND POOR NEIGHBORHOODS. HAVE BEEN MORE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND HAVE RECOVERED MORE SLOWLY. BUT WE COULD KNOW MUCH MUCH MORE ABOUT HOW THESE COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED AND HOW TO HELP THEM. YEAH IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WITHIN VOTE INVOLVING CLIMATE. IT WOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY URGENT TO UNDERSTAND THE LOCAL IMPACT. OF NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS WILDFIRES. IT IS CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE IN THE BASE WHICH FILE. AT LEAST FOR THE MANY EMPLOYERS WITH WITH MULTIPLE JOB SITES. NOW TO GATHER THESE FOUR DATA ELEMENTS BESIDES IMPROVING OUR PROVISION OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND BESIDES TRACKING. HOW THE ECONOMY'S DOING RIGHT. AT THE CALIFORNIA LEVELED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL OF MY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS RIGHT. IT WILL ALSO ALLOW BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW LABOR MARKET REGULATIONS AFFECT WORKERS BUSINESSES AND LOCAL LABOR MARKET WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. WHEN WE EVALUATED THE MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF LA. THE ABSENCE OF DATA ON OURS. RIGHT WAS AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION. AS A RESULT WE COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHICH BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY WE'RE EMPLOYING WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT WAS A REAL LOSS NOW OF COURSE WE WANT TO SEE WHICH WORKERS ACTUALLY BENEFITED BY THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH WE COULD NOT. WILLING RIGHT WE ALSO WANTED TO SEE WHICH SMALLER BUSINESSES MIGHT BE STRUGGLING. AND WHICH SMALLER BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF INCREASES IN WAGES COULD BENEFIT FROM TARGETED PROGRAMS FOR SMALL BUSINESS DISTRICT THE COUNTY AND CITY MADE AVAILABLE. TO YOU KNOW BUSINESS AFFECTED BY THE MINIMUM WAGE SO THERE WAS A REAL LOSS IN AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR REGULATIONS AFFECT THE LABOR MARKET WORKERS BUSINESSES RIGHT BECAUSE OF AN ABSENCE. OF DATA ON HOURS WORKED. AND LAST AND DEFINITELY NOT LEAST AND WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND ENHANCING THAT BASE WAGE FIGHT. WILL ALSO HELP TO IMPROVE THE SERVICES THAT CALIFORNIA PROVIDES. TO ITS UNEMPLOYED WORKERS BEGAN. TO DISH ALL DATA ELEMENTS WOULD ALLOW IT TO BETTER MEASURE THE IMPACT OF EXISTING SERVICES. AND HELP TO PLACE WORKERS INTO APPROPRIATE. JOBS AND SERVICES. NO NO LET ME SUM UP. ROUTE INFORMATION ON HOURS AND LOCATION WOULD ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE LABOR MARKET. AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEMS. TO REALLY PREPARE CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE. FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND YOU KNOW. LIMIT INEQUALITY AND POVERTY. INFORMATION ON LOCATION OF MARKET DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHO BENEFITS FROM TRAINING HOW TO FURTHER IMPROVE TRAINING DELIVERY AND WHO'S BEING MOST AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LABOR MARKET. NOW GIVEN THE STAGGERING IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE CALIFORNIA LABOR MARKET IN PARTICULAR. ON JOBS FOR LOWER AND MIDDLE INCOME WORKERS. I BELIEVE THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY TO MOVE FORWARD TO ENHANCE CALIFORNIA'S. U. I. BASE WHICH FILE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT OTHER STATES HAVE DELIVERED A BLUEPRINT ON HOW TO DO IT- SOME EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO DO OUTREACH. FOR EXAMPLE OR HOW TO INVOLVE PAYROLL PROCESSES. AND I THINK NOW THAT THE WORST OF THE PANDEMIC IS BEHIND US IT MAY BE JUST THE RIGHT MOMENT WE HAVE TO ACT ON YOU I BASICALLY. THANK YOU. SO WE JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR OFF BASE WE ACTUALLY ARE IN TERMS OF CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN THE JOB TRAINING WE PROVIDE. AND THE JOBS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY SECURE. YES A VERY GOOD QUESTION AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I ONLY HAVE A PARTIAL ANSWER IN THE SENSE THAT. YEAH BUT THE TEMPO TO THIS EARLIER. SEVERAL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT BE EVALUATED IN THE COUNCIL STATUS USING QUARTERLY EARNINGS WHICH BY THE WAY THAT'S THE INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR ANY EVALUATION FOR ANY STATE OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL. FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS LIKE THESE TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE AND RAISING WAGES. RIGHT OKAY I SHOULD SAY THIS EXACTLY FOUNDER EFFECT OF IT RAISING EARNINGS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY EFFECTIVELY RAISE WAGES OR THEY EFFECTIVELY RAVES ALWAYS WORKS SO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY GETTING. BETTER JOBS RIGHT OR WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING MORE AND THAT'S JUST A CRUCIAL DISTINCTION WE ALSO DON'T REALLY KNOW AT LEAST FROM. THOSE DATA RIGHT WHETHER WORKERS ACTUALLY END UP IN AN OCCUPATION THEY WERE TRAINED FOR- NOW. THERE IS OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE TRAINING PROVIDERS THAT IS CAN BE USED TO ASSESS THAT QUESTION BUT WHAT WE CANNOT DO. IS DO THAT ANALYSIS COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS ALL TRAINING PROVIDERS ARE ACROSS ALL WORKERS OR LOCATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT COLLECTING ALWAYS WORK OR WE'RE NOT COLLECTING OCCUPATION. WHICH IS THE ISSUE WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRAINING PROGRAMS THE- THE RESULTS STATED TENDS TO BE ANECDOTAL. IN PARTICULAR REGIONS WHERE RELATIONSHIPS ALL OF THE DATA FLOW TO GO BOTH WAYS I ASSUME. AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT YOU MUST BE TALKING ABOUT SIR. WELL THERE IS IN OTHER WAYS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR DEBT TO ACCEPTANCE OF TRAINING WHEN I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT. ESSENTIALLY STATISTICAL EVALUATION FOR EXAMPLE OF WHETHER A PARTICULAR. YOU CAN PROGRAM A TRAINING PROGRAM RAISES THE OUTCOME OF THE WORKERS ATTENDING IT NEXT OFTEN DONE WE ARE SEPARATE TREATMENT CONTROL COMPARISON. AND THEN ONE NEEDS AN OTCOME AND WHAT COULD USE VARIOUS OUTCOMES ARE. OFTEN ONE NEEDS VERY LARGE DATASETS TO EFFECTIVELY DO SUCH A STATISTICAL TREATMENT CONTROL COMPARISON ANDY WHY BASE WHICH FILE IS USUALLY THE GO TO PLACE TO DO THAT. IN THE ABSENCE TO DO TO ACTUALLY GET SUCH A STATISTICAL MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS THERE ARE WAYS TO DOING EITHER YOU KNOW INTERVIEWS OF CASE WORKERS OR DATA COLLECTIONS THROUGH EXIT INTERVIEWS OR- SURVEYS THAT CAN YOU KNOW GET A FINE GRAIN VIEW ON THE GROUND OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. IT JUST GETS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO AGGREGATE THAT UP AND TOOK IT TO GET A BIRD'S EYE VIEW RIGHT OFF OF WHERE WE ARE AT DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE YES AND TO ACCOMPLISH SIMPLY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT I ASSUME. IN THE STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. AS DIVERSE AND LARGE IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING DO IT RUNNING IN IT WHAT WE WOULD CALL IN POLITICS A GROUND GAME. AS OPPOSED TO CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. WELL I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH. MANY TRAINING PROVIDERS AND EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND THEY DO INVALUABLE WORK IN COLLECTING DATA. CAN I VIEW THESE VARIOUS EFFORTS TO COLLECT DATA AS COMPLEMENTARY. AND MY POINT IS WE'RE MISSING AN IMPORTANT PIECE. IS A STANDARDIZED COLLECTION OF DATA THAT ALLOWS US TO COMPUTE HOURLY WAGES AND UNDERSTAND WHICH OCCUPATION INDIVIDUALS GET. AND THAT WOULD COMPLEMENTALL THE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE UNDERGROUND DATA TRAINING PROVIDERS CURRENTLY HAVE. NO I DON'T KNOW I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION I'M NOT SURE FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS BUT- SHOULD WE DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ENHANCED DATA COLLECTION THE BASE WAGE FILE WHATEVER. WHAT POTENTIAL- IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COST ELEMENTS. HAVE YOU SEEN IN THE PAST. WITH EFFORTS SUCH AS THAT. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE- IT DIDN'T- IT IT GETS OFTEN INTO THE VERY NITTY GRITTY- AT OF WHAT HAPPENS ON THE GROUND AS THIS DATA IS COLLECTED AND WHEN WE USE THESE DATA WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO REALLY FOLLOW BACK THE PIPELINE. FROM WHEN A PERSON SORT OF FILLS IN AN ELECTRONIC DATA SHEET TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE MEASUREMENT ISSUES WORK NOW. I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- WHAT SINCE WE WERE INTERESTED IN HOURS WORK- AT SOME POINT. WE CONTACTED. PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WEAPON COLLECTING HOURS WORK FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THE OBVIOUS QUESTION WAS. ISN'T IT HARD FOR BUSINESSES TO FIGURE OUT ON A WEEKLY BASIS HOW MANY HOURS THERE ARE. MARKERS WORK WOULDN'T DAY EITHER ALL GIVE FORTY HOURS WHICH IS FULL TIME OR TWENTY HOURS SAY WHICH PART TIME OR OR NOT SO IN THIS INFORMATION. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NOISE IN THE STATE EYES IS BEING COLLECTED. WHERE THE NOISE WOULD REFLECT PARTLY THE COST AND THE EFFORT. THAT THE EMPLOYERS WOULD FACE IN IN IN PROVIDING THE STATUS IT TURNED OUT THAT. THE DATA ON OURS COLLECTED IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IT'S A VERY HIGH QUALITY AND IT COMES NOT ONLY FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS. WITH THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND COLLECTING THIS DATA. THEY ARE KIND OF PART OF THE E. D. IN WASHINGTON STATE BUT ALSO OF THE RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THE STATE OF WASHINGTON USING THE OUR STATE. SO NOW GIVEN THEY HAVE OUR STATE AND WE NOW KNOW A LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. THAT I'D LOVE TO KNOW ABOUT CALIFORNIA BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE OUR STATE OUT AND IT LOOKS LIKE. IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE RELATIVELY STRAIGHT FORWARD TO- COLLECT. VERY INTERESTING AND I SUPPOSE CONTACT WITH THE STATE OF WASHINGTON OR OREGON COULD GIVE US SOME. FINANCIAL DATA ON THE COST OF ANY SYSTEMS. MODIFICATIONS THAT THOSE STATES HAD TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO CONVENTIONALLY EXPAND THE- THE BASE WAGE BASE WAGE FILE. I THINK SO AND I THINK- YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE EXISTING. NETWORKS AND RAMIFICATIONS SUCH AS YOU KNOW DR SAXONS NETWORKS BUT ALSO THEIR DIRECT CONTACT THAT. MANY OF THE EDT I BELIEVE HALF TO DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND- I KNOW I HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TO UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND ARE YOU I. AGENCY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANOTHER PROGRAM. CALLED WORK SCHERING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE DOING ON OUTREACH AND MICHIGAN HAD JUST A STAGGERING PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND NEED ALONE BEHOLD THEY HAVE A WHOLE BLUEPRINT ON HOW TO DO OUTREACH ON THESE ISSUES AND WILL BE JUST INTERESTING TO SEE. YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING IN THIS SPACE. EXCELLENT SERVER FORGOTTEN TO ASK YOU SOMETHING THAT I SHOULD'VE. NO YOU HAVEN'T THANKS FOR YOUR UESTIONS THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION VERY ENLIGHTENING AND APPRECIATE YOUR WORK AND KEEP DOING IT WE REALLY BENEFIT FROM IT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WELL WE FINISHED OUR- TWO PANEL GROUPS WERE NOT GOING TO MOVE INTO THE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A VERY WALKS ON ME THAT THIS IS SORT OF LIKE- THIS LEVEL OF NAVEL GAZING AND- YOU KNOW CORRUPT ENTITIES POLICING THEMSELVES MAKES SENSE TO ME. AND THEN YOU GET A COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR AND SUPPOSE THAT EXPERT ON THERE AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU HOW LIKE MORE JOB OPENINGS- THAT- YOU HAVE MORE UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE THAN THERE ARE JOB OPENINGS. WHAT PEOPLE DOING DOWN THERE IN SACRAMENTO AND THEN YOU'VE GOT- SHOT AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISSUE AND YOU'RE CREATING YOU'RE CREATING A JOB. PROBLEM WITH THESE UNCONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE.
