00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:53.291
MONEY THIS ALREADY BEEN

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:55.994
COLLECTED AS OPPOSED TO RAISING

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.162
FEES.

00:29:57.228 --> 00:29:59.164
AND I IT JUST ONE POINT OUT THAT

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.299
IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAD AN

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:03.234
INCREASE IN FEES OF ONE HUNDRED

00:30:03.301 --> 00:30:04.402
AND 10%.

00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.838
ON RESIDENTIAL.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:11.075
FOR A A DEFICIT OF EIGHT HUNDRED

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:11.709
NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:12.343
ROTH FUND.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.512
AND THE ASK WAS FOR TWO POINT

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:15.880
THREE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:18.116
AT THE TIME WE COMPLAINED

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.584
VOCIFEROUSLY THAT.

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:22.987
THAT WAS TOO HIGH OF A RECENT

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.756
FEES GIVEN THE DEFICIT.

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:27.158
AND IF WE'RE NOT WORKING OUT.

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.593
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS NOT FUND

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:30.094
THAT'S NEEDING A HOME.

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:32.130
PERHAPS WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:33.531
FEES BEING TOO HIGH.

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.033
WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY STATES

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:37.602
THAT HAS A PER BED LICENSING FEE.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:39.938
THIS CONSTRUCT ACCESS TO CARE

00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:41.339
BECAUSE EVEN IN YOUR SMALLER

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.775
NONPROFIT SOCIAL MODELS THEY'RE

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.476
MAKING DETERMINATIONS ON HOW

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:48.713
BASED ON A THREE HUNDRED AND

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.082
FIFTY DOLLAR FEE PER BED.

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:52.784
SO IF THIS IS A TRULY.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.419
TRYING TO FIND A HOME WE WOULD

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:56.020

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:11.469
OTHER STATES ARE ONLY FIVE THAT

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.338

INTO ACCOUNT CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER

FILING TAX THRESHOLD WHICH MEANS

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.675
FEWER INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:40.044

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.646
UP BEYOND THAT WE TOOK THE

TWENTY SIXTEEN FEDERAL DATA GREW

00:44:44.314 --> 00:44:46.917
IT BY PROJECTION ASSUMING THAT

NO LONGER BE COVERED BY

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:50.120
INSURANCE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:51.655
THE FEDERAL PENALTY.

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.390

BASED ON ESTIMATES PROVIDED BY

THIS SUNSET WILL GIVE US TIME TO

00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:47.244
RE EVALUATE THE MERITS OF THE

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:48.579

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.647
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT.

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:52.249
ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABILITY.

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.151
OF COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:55.853
WILL REQUIRES STATE AND FEDERAL

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:56.820
PARTNERSHIP.

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.088
AND BUILDING IN THE SUNSET TIME

00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:00.390
WILL ALLOW US TO REASSESS.

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:02.292
AT THAT TIME ADDITIONALLY WE

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:03.827
HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL.

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.129
TO CREATE THE HEALTHY CALIFORNIA

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:06.597
FOR ALL COMMISSION WHICH WILL BE

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:09.600
ANALYZING DIFFERENT SINGLE PAYER

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:09.900
PROPOSALS.

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:11.401

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:13.971
HALF.

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:15.439
AT WHICH TIME WE WILL BE ABLE TO

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:16.607
USE THAT DATA TO REASSESS THIS

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.542

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.077
OF ON YOUR SECOND OR THIRD

24100% OF THE FPL BE SUBJECT TO

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:26.583

BOUNCE AND INDIVIDUAL PENALTY

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.892
PAYMENTS -- WE THINK THAT

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.126
RECONCILIATION IS NECESSARY

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.195
BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.763
EXCEEDS THE FEDERAL.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.365
OF PROGRAM THAT'S CURRENTLY IN

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:42.132
PLACE THAT IT STOPS OFFERING

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:43.934
FIDDLES IS ASSISTANCE AT FOUR

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:45.002
HUDRED F. P. L..

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:46.103
IF WE DON'T MAINTAIN THE

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.571
RECONCILIATION COMPONENT OF OUR

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:48.906
PROPOSAL THERE COULD BE

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.608
INSTANCES WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:53.143
JUST ABOVE OR JUST BELOW THAT.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:54.578
THRESHOLD AND RECEIVING BOTH

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.847
FEDERAL AND STATE ASSISTANCE

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.516
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:01.318
PREFER TO AVOID.

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.786
AND THEN DOES THIS PROPOSAL MAKE

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.922
A MEANINGFUL FED FOR INDIVIDUALS

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:05.956
BELOW FOR HER PERCENT F. PEEL

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:06.924
BASED OFF THE MODELING THAT

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.258
COVER CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED.

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:09.560
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPOSAL

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.728
WOULD RESULT AND A HUNDRED

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:13.463
THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY NEW

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.032
INDIVIDUALS AND ROLLED.

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.833
IN INSURANCE BELOW THE HOLE

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:19.369
4100% FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

00:47:19.436 --> 00:47:20.804
OF FURTHER COVER CALIFORNIA

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:22.005
ESTIMATES THAT THIS PROPOSAL

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:24.708
WOULD REDUCE PREMIUM GROWTH BY.

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:29.179
UP 28% -- IN COVER YOUR TWENTY

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:30.147
TWENTY AND THEN FINALLY HOW

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.516
RAPIDLY DUE OUT YOUR COSTS GROW.

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.152
IF WE DO NOT MODIFY THE PROGRAM

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.453
DESIGNED IN THE OUT YEARS.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.754
SO WORKING WITH COVER CALIFORNIA

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:39.122
WE IDENTIFIED TWO PRIMARY

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:40.257
FACTORS THAT RESULTS IN

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:42.192
SIGNIFICANT OUT YOUR COST GROWTH

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:43.860
IS YOUR PREMIUM GROWTH AND THEN

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:46.964
THE GROWTH OF PERSONAL INCOME IF

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:48.432
THE GROWTH OF PERSONAL INCOME

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:48.999
DOES NOT KEEP.

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:52.402
PACE WITH THE COST OF PREMIUMS.

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.104
THE STATE SHARE OF COST FOR

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.839
INDIVIDUALS PREMIUM INCREASES

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:57.574
RAPIDLY.

00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.042
SO BASED OFF THE MALL THAT WE

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:01.545
HAVE PROPOSED TODAY ROUGHLY IF

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:03.981
WE MAINTAIN THIS MODEL IN YOUR

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:06.550
ONE YEAR TWO AND YEAR -- THREE

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:08.418
WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST FOR

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:09.653
INDIVIDUALS ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.855
F. P. L. COULD GROW BY UP 230%

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:13.924
IN YOUR ONE AND THEN ANOTHER 30%

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.926
IN YOUR TWO RESULTING IN

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:17.995
ADDITIONAL COSTS OF RANGING

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:21.865
BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:22.799
HUNDRED MILLION -- FOR THOSE TWO

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.302
ADDITIONAL YEARS -- WE LIKE TO

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:25.802
NOTE THAT OUR INTENT IN

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:26.737
DESIGNING THIS PROGRAM IS TO

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.572
MAINTAIN AN AVERAGE SUBSIDY

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.007
AMOUNT ABOVE FOR THE INDIVIDUALS

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.275
ABOVE FOUR HUNDRED F. P. L. OF

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:32.776
ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:34.077
MONTH.

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:35.445
AND MAINTAIN THAT AVERAGE

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:36.913
MONTHLY SUBSIDY FOR INDIVIDUALS

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.516
BELOW FOUR HUNDRED A MONTH AT

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.284
ABOUT TEN DOLLARS.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.718
AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO

00:48:41.785 --> 00:48:43.220
ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.422
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:46.056
GOING STRAIGHT TO THE QUESTIONS

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:48.458
ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WE DIDN'T

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:48.959
HAVE TO ASK.

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:52.562
NEXT WITNESS PLEASE.

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:54.064
BROWN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE

00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:55.966
ANALYST'S OFFICE -- LIKE ALL OF

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.267
THE OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE MAYOR

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.802
VISION OUR OFFICE CONTINUES TO

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:01.204
EVALUATE THESE AS AS ADDITIONAL

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.806
DETAIL IS IS COMING OUT WERE

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.308
REVIEWING THIS SPECIFIC BENEFIT

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:05.575
PARAMETERS THAT WERE JUST.

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:07.511
DESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:10.580
FINANCE -- IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:11.648
COMMENTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:13.950
THEM AT THIS POINT I'M JUST WANT

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:15.419
TO REITERATE THAT -- AS WITH --

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:16.920
OTHER.

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:18.622
AT PROPOSES IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.157
BUDGET THIS INVOLVES A SUNSET.

00:49:20.223 --> 00:49:22.359
AND IT HAS SOME OF THE SAME

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:23.727
ISSUES THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.595
RIVAS LEE ABOUT -- POTENTIAL

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:27.097
COST PRESSURES IN THE OUT YEARS

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.499
IN THE BUDGET -- WHERE IT T MAY

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:32.202
BE DIFFICULT TO TO END THIS

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:34.338
BENEFIT -- EVEN THOUGH THE THE

00:49:34.404 --> 00:49:36.807
THE MULTI YEAR AND HIS BALANCED

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:38.742
ON THE PREMISE THAT.

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:40.077
THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE SUNSET --

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.678
SO THAT'S SOMETHING FOR IT FOR

00:49:41.745 --> 00:49:43.647
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER --

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.248
BEYOND THAT AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:47.517
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS --

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:49.753
WHETHER THE ALLOCATION OF THE

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.022
PENALTY REVENUES TO INDIVIDUALS

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:54.224
ABOVE 4100% OF F. P. L. WHO

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.492
CURRENTLY RECEIVE NO ASSISTANCE.

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.227
VERSES INDIVIDUALS BELOW 4100%

00:49:57.294 --> 00:49:58.395
OF F. P. L. WHO DO RECEIVE

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:00.063
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS CONSISTENT

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.431
WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES.

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:02.833
THE GOVERNOR HAS.

00:50:02.899 --> 00:50:04.134
PROPOSED TO SPEND THE MAJORITY

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.602
THE REVENUES FOR THOSE THAT ARE

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.371
CURRENTLY ON SUBSIDIZED.

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:08.405
AND THAT HAS POLICY MERITS IN

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:10.006
THAT DOWN THOSE INDIVIDUALS --

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:11.274
CURRENTLY HAVE SOME OF THE

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.743
HIGHEST COSTS.

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.711
BUT AS A SIDE RESULT AM VERY

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:16.279
LITTLE IS IS LEFT FOR THE THE

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.414
GROUP THAT'S BELOW SO THAT'S

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:19.116
SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:50:19.182 --> 00:50:21.818
CONSIDER AS WELL -- BEYOND THAT

THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THEIR

MEDI CAL TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.301
DOLLARS A MONTH DOESN'T SOUND

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.536
LIKE A LOT OF MONEY UNTIL YOU

00:52:19.603 --> 00:52:20.637
REALIZE FOR TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.172
LIVING ON TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

00:52:22.239 --> 00:52:22.906
A MONTH.

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:24.875
THEN IT'S REAL MONEY WE WOULD

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.209
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:28.345
PEOPLE OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT COST

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:29.980
TEN OR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.348
TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE.

00:52:31.414 --> 00:52:34.351
WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE MAKING.

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:36.219
BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND 38% OF

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.922
POVERTY IN 2100% OF POVERTY

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.458
THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND TO

00:52:41.525 --> 00:52:42.292
TWENTY FOUR OR THIRTY THOUSAND

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:43.393

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:45.161
AGAIN THAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:47.430
SPEND FIFTY A HUNDRED A HUNDRED

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.698

THEIR PREMIUM SUCH A LOT OF

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.468
MONEY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:52.836
ON THAT KIND OF INCOME.

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:54.538
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:57.207
PROPOSAL CUTS OFF HELP AT 2100%

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.476
OF POVERTY WE UNDERSTOOD IT WHEN

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:00.544
IT HAD TO DO WITH COPAYS AND

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.279
DEDUCTIBLES BUT WE'RE TALKING

00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:03.813
ABOUT PREMIUMS NOW.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.081
SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CUT

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.751
OFF A 2100% WE ALSO DON'T

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:10.587
UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ISN'T MORE

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:11.988
GENERAL FUND HELP.

00:53:12.055 --> 00:53:13.657
THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT THE

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:16.459
MANDATE PENALTY RAISES FOR A

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:18.361
COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION MORE ON

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.199
ABOUT.

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:25.001
WE'RE ALSO PERPLEXED WHY WE HAVE

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:26.937
A SUNSET ON THE AFFORDABILITY

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.872
AND NOT ON THE MANDATE THE

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.040
MANDATE IS AN EQUALLY

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:32.142
COMPLICATED IN NEW THING TO DO

THE MANDATE.

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.846
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO SUNSET ONE

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:38.348
WE SHOULD PROBABLY SUNSET THE

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.683

HAVE COVERAGE AS THEY CAN'T

00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:49.693

00:53:52.862 --> 00:53:54.397

THE STATE.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.614
OVER TIME THE AND WE WOULD

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:34.216
CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:35.851
EDUCATION COMPONENT OF THAT

TO BE TO EDUCATE OUR YOUTH AND

01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:45.093
OUR PARENTS ABOUT WHAT THE RISKS

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.229
ARE OF CANNABIS AND SO HAVING

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.664
THAT BETTER -- DATA CAPACITY TO

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.199
THAN TARGET OUR INTERVENTION SO

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:56.004

JUST HAVE A MINOR COME IN I MEAN

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.343
THESE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.878
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED

01:18:02.944 --> 01:18:04.646
BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:07.949
FOUR BUT THAT SAID -- ONE POINT

01:18:08.016 --> 01:18:09.084
WE WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THE DATA

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.652
IS THE DATA COLLECTION AND THE

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.320
DATA REPORTING THE DATA SYSTEMS

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:13.688
IS JUST THAT.

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.390
CANNABIS IS JUST ONE SUBSTANCE

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:16.992
OUT OF MANY SUBSTANCES THAT CAN

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.094
AFFECT YOUTH AND SO TO THE

EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:23.598
CREATE SORT OF A COHESIVE --

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:25.667
DASHBOARD -- OR WAY TO ACCESS

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.135
INFORMATION TO DO COMPARATIVE

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.604
ANALYSIS -- WOULD BE QUITE

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.540
HELPFUL.

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.075
I CAN RESPOND TO THAT.

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.409
YEAH WE'RE BUILDING.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.078
WHAT WE CALL THE ECOSYSTEM OF

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:37.379
DATA AND SO WE'RE USING THESE

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:39.347
DOLLARS FOR CANNABIS MUCH LIKE

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:41.316
WE'RE USING OPI DOLLARS TO START

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.451
TO BUILD THAT STATEWIDE --

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:44.519
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM WHEREBY WE

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:46.188
CAN LOOK ACROSS DISEASES --

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.023
COSTS SPECIFIC THINGS TO MAKE

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:49.524
SURE THAT WE'RE LEARNING HOW

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.093
THEY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:53.161
AND SO BY PULLING THOSE

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:54.596
INDIVIDUAL DATA ANY OF THAT

01:18:54.663 --> 01:18:55.897
USING OUR FUNDING AS WISELY AS

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.332
POSSIBLE TO BUILD THE COMPONENTS

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:58.967
THAT WE NEED FOR CANNABIS.

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:00.769
BUT CONNECTING UP TO A HUB SO

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.170
THAT ALTHOUGH DATABASES MAY LIVE

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.772
IN OTHER PLACES WE CAN BRING ALL

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.273
OF THAT DATA INTO ONE PLACE SO

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.143
THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS BENEFIT

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:10.212
FROM THAT INFORMATION.

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:10.846
DOES THE HUB ALREADY EXIST WE'RE

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:11.746
BUILDING THAT NOW AND WE'RE

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:13.348
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIECE DOLLARS

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.450
TOGETHER FROM FEDERAL OPIOID

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.852
DOLLARS WHEN WE GET DISEASE

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:18.553
SPECIFIC MONEY WE TRY TO BUILD

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.254
OUT.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.856
SO THAT WE CAN BRING ALL OF THIS

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.157
TOGETHER IN THE HUB.

CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT A LITTLE

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:12.774
BIT -- YEAH I'M THINKING OF

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:14.242
SPYING ON PEOPLE I KNOW THAT'S

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.344
NOT TRUE APPROPRIATE BUT SAYS

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.779
ENTER STAND ENSURE SYSTEM BY

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:19.781
SURVEILLANCE WE MEAN COLLECTING

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:22.284
DATA ACROSS DATA SAT SO WE WANT

01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:24.653
TO KNOW IF THERE ARE UTILIZATION

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.087
MEDICAL UTILIZATION WE WOULD

WHERE ARE THE RETAILERS

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.128
ESTABLISHMENTS FOR CANNABIS

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:34.429
WHERE PEOPLE CAN PURCHASE DOES

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:36.064

AROUND THERE TO A GREATER EXTENT

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.100
AND BILL DISPARITIES INTO THE

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.902
SYSTEM.

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:42.370
WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:43.672
CORRECTIONS DATA ARE THERE ANY

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:45.173
DIFFERENCES ON HOW THAT'S BEING

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.775
APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE ARE

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:48.143
THERE AREAS IN THE STATE THAT

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.011
ARE MOST HIGHLY IMPACTED SO THAT

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:50.879
WHEN WE GET.

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:54.916
INFORMATION THAT WE COULD TAILOR

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:57.152
THOSE MESSAGES USING THAT DATA

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:58.420
BECAUSE WITHOUT DATA WE REALLY

01:20:58.486 --> 01:20:59.988
DON'T KNOW HOW TO TARGET OR WHAT

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:02.057
THE YEAH THE OTHER PIECE IS SORT

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:04.459
OF A AND ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.561
ABOUT CANNABIS BECAUSE THE WAY

01:21:06.628 --> 01:21:07.896
THAT WE'VE CHANGED THE CURB.

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:09.397
ON TOBACCO IS TO REALLY

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.032
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:13.401
SEE THE REST OR DIDN'T SEE SOME

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:15.870
OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.339
HAVE WITH OUR NEWEST CAMPAIGN ON

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.974
TOBACCO IS AROUND JEWELS AND HE

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:19.874
CIGARETTES.

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:21.409
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE ARE

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.311
CONTAIN NICOTINE OF THOSE HAVE

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:24.646
THE SAME OBJECTIVE PERSON YOU

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:26.181
KNOW CHARACTERISTICS SO BUILDING

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:27.882
A SYSTEM BY WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.117
THAT DATA AND THE SAME WAY WE

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.819
LOOK AT TOBACCO DATA WE CAN NOW

01:21:30.885 --> 01:21:32.420
LOOK AT CANNABIS AND MANY OF THE

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:33.421
SAME WAYS.

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:37.459
SO WELL THEN WILL YOU BE LOOKING

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:38.860
OUT -- AREAS WHERE.

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:41.129
CULTIVATION IS A BIG PART OF THE

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:43.164
CULTURE OF OF CERTAIN COUNTIES

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.132
IN AREA WE'RE HOPING TO BRING

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:45.734
ALL THAT DATA AND ALTHOUGH THOSE

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.168
ARE REGULATED BY DIFFERENT PARTS

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.503
OF THE STATE WE WOULD HOPE TO

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.038
BRING ALL OF THAT DATA INTO ONE

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:51.673
PLACE SO WE CAN ALL SHARE IN THE

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:51.873
I AM.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.008
THAT DATA.

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:53.975
BUT BECAUSE THE REASON I ASK

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.977
THIS ASSET IS THAT -- IN IN SOME

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.612
OF OUR IN IN A COUPLE OF MY

01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:00.115
COUNTIES WE HAVE REALLY HIGH

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:02.284
LEVELS OF ASUS.

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:05.320
THAT -- AND THE ONE COMMON

01:22:05.387 --> 01:22:08.223
FACTOR THERE IS HAS BEEN HAS

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:11.226
BEEN CANNABIS AND AND SO I JUST

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:11.826
WANT TO ASSURE THAT IF YOU'RE

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:12.827
DOING STE.

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:13.928
SURVEILLANCE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:15.130
NOT JUST AT RETAIL

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:15.864
ESTABLISHMENTS BUT YOU'RE

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.365
LOOKING AT COMMUNITIES WERE

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.800
WHERE THIS HAS BEEN CULTIVATED

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.535
FOR MANY YEARS UNDER SECRECY

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.737
WHATEVER -- AND THAT DOESN'T

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:23.805
THERE THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:25.573
STATE SIDE SURE THAT'S AND WILL

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.841
BE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL IN

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.443
TRYING TO BUILD AS MANY OF THOSE

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:29.344
DATA BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:30.512
WANT TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:32.113
PROVIDE DATA. TO THE OTHER

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.115
GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:35.984
REGULATORY MARKET AS WELL AND SO

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.019
WHAT WE HAVE MANUFACTURERS BUT

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.454
YOU'RE OF CANNABIS CONTROL AND

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:41.189
SEE IF I ALSO HAVE A ROLE IN

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.692
THAT SO BRING SOME OF THAT DATA

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:44.292
TOGETHER WOULD BE VERY USEFUL

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:44.592
[inaudible]

UP. TO THIS QUESTION IT'S MY

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:49.964
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.299
DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALSO

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:53.702
INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SURVEY WORK

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.003
THROUGH SOME OF THE HEALTH

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.004
SURVEYS TO HAVE A REAL

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.540
UNDERSTANDING OF USAGE RATES

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:01.443
AMONG USE AND PERCEPTIONS OF

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:04.145
RISK THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:05.180
EXACTLY JUST FRAZIER THE KIND OF

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.081
PLAYS INTO WHAT I WAS JUST GOING

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.749
TO GO TO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.117
PERCEPTIONS OF RISK.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:10.085
THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.319
EDUCATION COMPONENT.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:13.221
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THERE AND I

01:23:13.288 --> 01:23:15.657

BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT --

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:22.530
DESCRIBES OF HOW WHEN DRIVING

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:25.467
IMPAIRMENT -- PROCESS GOES

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.534
THROUGH BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:27.736
LOT OF THE DRIVER'S TRAINING

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:28.002

ALSO WILL DO SOME FORMATIVE

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:51.519
RESEARCH WHICH IS MORE ON THE

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.254
EDUCATION SIDE WHERE WE DO FOCUS

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:55.156
GROUPS AND MORE DETAILED LOOK.

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.659
AT INDIVIDUALS TO REALLY GET AT

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:59.627
ME A WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE HEALTH

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.496
HELP HOW DO THEY PERCEIVE RISK

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:02.230
AROUND.

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:03.898
AND CAN'T ABOUT SOME WHAT TYPES

01:25:03.965 --> 01:25:05.500
OF CANNABIS EDIBLES VERSUS

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:08.036
SMOKING VERSUS OTHER USES WHICH

01:25:08.102 --> 01:25:09.471
I NEVER KNEW HOW MANY WAYS YOU

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:10.538
COULD USE CANNABIS UNTIL I

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.574
STARTED I'M NOT -- AND SO REALLY

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.376
UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE WHAT'S

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.212
THE METHOD THAT THEY'RE SING AS

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:19.013
WE SAW WITH THE DEPOK OF MARKET

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:21.115
AS YOU RULE ONE THING OUT PEOPLE

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:22.517
SORT OF SEE THAT AS BAD.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.118
THEY COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:25.887
AND SO ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.856
OF THINGS THAT WILL BE MORE

01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:29.724
ATTRACTIVE TO USE OVER TIME AND

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.025
HOW DO WE COMBAT THAT WITH RISK

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:32.627
MESSAGE AS AND SO WILL BE

01:25:32.694 --> 01:25:33.294
COLLECTING.

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.797
THAT ATTITUDINAL SORT OF SHIFT

01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:37.265
AND HOW DO WE GONNA BRING THAT

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:41.069
AROUND SO THAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:41.769
DID WITH TO BACK.

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:42.370
BECAUSE TWELVE MILLION SEEMS

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:43.638
LIKE A LOT FOR SURVEILLANCE.

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.139
IT IT'S BOTH SURVEILLANCE AND

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.175
EDUCATION I THINK THAT WHAT WE

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:49.043
HAVE IN OUR BCP WHAT IS REALLY

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:50.512
THAT IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.046
BUILDING WILL PUT MORE TOWARDS

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:53.481
SURVEILLANCE BUT THEN

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.116
MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS WILL

01:25:55.183 --> 01:25:56.618
BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE.

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:58.052
AND SO OF THEM WILL TURN MORE OF

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.054
THAT TO THE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND

01:26:00.121 --> 01:26:02.257
INFORMATION CAMPAIGN.

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.325
SO I DO KNOW THAT -- WHAT IT THE

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:06.160
ON IN IN THE INFORMATION TWENTY

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:07.595
POINT TWENTY ONE MILLION?

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.797
IS FOR EDUCATION PREVENTION

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:12.033
EARLY INTERVENTION -- SO I

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.569

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:18.206
