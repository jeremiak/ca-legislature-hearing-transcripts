01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:41.175
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:42.844
SYSTEM AND THEY ALL BOIL DOWN

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.979
TO. NOT ENOUGH MONIES FOR ALL

THE NEEDS FOR OUR OUR COLLEGE

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:49.283
SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO HE

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.252
WAS ALREADY KINDA LAID OUT THE

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.187
PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING I JUST

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:55.223
REALLY HAVE A COUPLE QUICK.

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.891
MAIN ISSUE THAT I WANT TO GET

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:57.492
OUT OF IT TODAY SO I WANT TO

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:59.827
PUT THIS OUT THERE FOR THE CSU

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.928
AND THE AUDIT TEAM HELP ME

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:02.730
UNDERSTAND IT'S REALLY THE WHAT

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.532
AND THE WHY THE WHAT IS THE

01:30:04.599 --> 01:30:07.135
REASON FOR THIS. RESERVE

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.770
ACCOUNTS THE AMOUNT THAT IT'S

01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:11.205
THEIR HOUSES RELATE TO OTHER

01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:12.240
STATE AGENCIES IN THE RESERVE

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:15.610
POLICIES THAT WE HAVE. AS FAR

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:17.178
AS DISCLOSURE PURPOSES WELL I

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.046
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I DON'T

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:22.083
THINK IT WAS AS MISTER MEDINA'S

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.452
STATED THAT IT WAS ALWAYS KNOWN

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:26.554
MAYBE IT WAS BURIED IN SON

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.456
TABLE THAT NOBODY SAW BUT AS

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:30.591
THAT PERSON DEALING WITH THE

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:33.194
ASSEMBLY BUDGET FOR CSU. I

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.428
NEVER REMEMBER HAVING A

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:35.530
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS IN THE

01:30:35.596 --> 01:30:37.765
PAST FIVE YEARS I'VE OVERSEEN

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:40.434
THE CSU BUDGET AND I'VE SPOKEN

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:41.836
TO OUR BUDGET YEAR AS WELL THIS

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:42.937
WENT OVER TING WE HAVE THE SAME

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:44.972
CONCLUSION HERE. SO I THINK

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:46.674
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE THAT

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.843
THERE WAS NOT IN THERE IS NOT

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.111
PROPER DISCLOSURE BUT THE BIG

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:52.413
PICTURE I THINK THE THAT THE

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.081
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:56.884
PICTURE IS THAT WE DO HAVE THIS

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.786
RESERVE FUND AND THE LOGIC OF

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.087
THIS IS THAT SUPPOSED TO HELP

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:06.494
US WHEN TIMES ARE BAD. IT'S

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:07.094
SUPPOSED TO HELP STUDENTS WHEN

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:11.732
TIMES ARE TOUGH. BUT THE

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:12.300
REALITY IS THAT DURING THE

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:13.534
LAST. GET IN THE ECONOMY WHEN

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:14.569
TIMES WERE TOUGH WE DIDN'T GET

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.670
INTO THIS RESERVE TO HELP OUR

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.371
STUDENTS. WE ACTUALLY INCREASE

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:18.005
THE ACCOUNT. AND OTHER WORDS OF

01:31:18.072 --> 01:31:19.373
A FAMILY SAVES. MONEY FOR A

01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.242
RAINY DAY AND THEY LOSE THEIR

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:22.610
THEIR JOB YOU WOULD THINK THAT

01:31:22.677 --> 01:31:24.445
RAINY DAY FUND. IS TO HELP THE

01:31:24.512 --> 01:31:25.980
FAMILY NOT TO CONTINUE TO

01:31:26.047 --> 01:31:27.648
INCREASE THAT RESERVE ACCOUNT

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:29.517
SO I THINK THAT IS THE QUESTION

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.552
THAT WE NEED. TO ADDRESS. IN

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.120
OTHER WORDS WHY DO YOU HAVE

01:31:33.187 --> 01:31:34.522
THIS RESERVE ACCOUNT IN THE

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:35.756
FIRST PLACE IF YOU'RE NOT GOING

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.092
TO USE IT. DURING AN ECONOMIC

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.828
DOWNTURN SO LOOK FOR

01:31:40.895 --> 01:31:41.362
DISCUSSIONS COMING FORWARD

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:46.033

SOMETIMES WE DO OUR ANNUAL

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:08.215
BUDGETS TO FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH

01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:12.420
COLLEGE IS GOING TO COST AND-

01:33:12.486 --> 01:33:14.855
THAT IS WHERE SOME OF MY

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.023
INTEREST STARTED TO COME IN

FULLERTON COLLEGE SOME VERY

01:33:26.067 --> 01:33:28.035
MUCH IMMERSED IN AND FULLER

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:30.905
TAKING COLLAGEN CSU AND-

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:35.176
EVERYTHING FROM PARKING. AS WE

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:40.848
HAVE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. NOT

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:47.254
USING THE PARKING. A PARKING

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:48.356
STRUCTURES AS THEY ARE VERY

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:50.992
COSTLY AND SO THIS ALL KIND OF

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:52.360
HITS HOME AND FULLER TEN IS

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:53.461
CONSIDERED THE EDUCATION

01:33:53.527 --> 01:33:54.829
COMMUNITY HAVING FULLERTON

INTO FULLER TEN. SO I VERY MUCH

01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:03.004
HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN THIS

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.238
ISSUE ON AND ALSO BEING A

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:06.073
THIRTY YEAR EDUCATOR BUT ALONG

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.441
WITH MANY OTHERS I WAS UPSET TO

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.643
LEARN THAT THE CS USE. HAD

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.679
ACCUMULATED A SURPLUS OF MORE

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:13.347
THAN ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:14.982
WHICH CONSISTED OF UNSPENT

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:17.151
TUITION AND PARKING REVENUE.

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:18.152
DURING THE SAME TIME THAT THE

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:20.388
SURPLUS WAS GROWING THE ANNUAL

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:22.223
TUITION FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:24.759
THE CSU CAMPUSES SUCH AS FULLER

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:27.561
TO NEARLY DOUBLED AND THE

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:30.164
INCREASED MORE FOR. FINANCIAL

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.867
SUPPORT TO THE CS USE. ALTHOUGH

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:34.735
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

01:34:34.802 --> 01:34:35.770
CONSIDERS THE SURPLUS TO BE

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:38.172
CRITICAL FOR SUPPORTING CSU'S

01:34:38.239 --> 01:34:40.341
OPERATIONAL NEEDS THEY DID NOT

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.842
DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:43.778
NEEDED FUNDS WHILE RAISING

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:46.213
TUITION COSTS. THROUGHOUT THIS

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.848
TIME STUDENTS AND PARENTS HAVE

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:50.151
HAD TO SHOULDER HUGE IN TUITION

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:52.453
INCREASES WHEN THE CAMPUSES

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.521
HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:57.491
EDUCATION MORE AFFORDABLE THEY

01:34:57.558 --> 01:35:02.396
FAILED TO DO SO. IN THE

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:03.964
MEANTIME I CAN STITCHES MY

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:04.765
CONSTITUENTS ATTENDING CAL

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.033
STATE FULLERTON ARE BURDENED

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.401
WITH THE MOST EXPENSIVE PARKING

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:07.902
PERMIT COSTS OF ALL OUR

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:10.571
CAMPUSES OR CSU LEADERSHIP

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.672
COULD HAVE HELPED OUR STUDENTS

EGREGIOUS THING THAT I THINK

WERE TAKING 10% CUTS IN THEIR

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:00.047
SIGNIFICANT CUT. WE ALSO LOST

01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:00.915
ME FACULTY MEMBERS WHO COULDN'T

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.850
AFFORD TO TAKE THE CUT. AND WE

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:04.451
WORK CONSTANTLY BEING INFORMED

01:37:04.518 --> 01:37:06.320
THAT THIS WAS THE CENTRAL FOR

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:07.688
US TO DO TO MAINTAIN THE

01:37:07.755 --> 01:37:09.423
SYSTEM. TO KEEP OUR C. ISSUE

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:11.325
ALIVE. AND THE FACULTY AND

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.526
STAFF DID THAT WITH THE

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:13.761
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:15.629
INVESTING IN. CALIFORNIA'S

01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:17.665
FUTURE FOR ITS INSTITUTION. AND

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.500
AS I REFLECT BACK AS A FACULTY

01:37:19.567 --> 01:37:22.269
MEMBER WHO WHO LOST 10% CUT. WE

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.003
ALL WERE MADE TO TAKE FOR

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:25.906
LEVELS. AND IT WASN'T AS

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:27.007
DIFFICULT FOR ME AS IT WAS FOR

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:28.876
THE MY CLERICAL STAFF TO WORK

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:29.877
FOR ME FOLKS WERE MAKING

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:31.579
PROBABLY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:32.846
DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WOOD AND

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:34.982
LOSING. 10% OF THAT SALARY.

01:37:35.049 --> 01:37:36.150
THEY HAD DIFFICULTY MAKING

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:37.518
THEIR RENT THEY HAD DIFFICULTY

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:38.752
DOING THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:40.821
WE CENTRAL. AND AS I LOOK AT

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:41.355
THIS REPORT AND I HAD TO

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:42.656
REFLECT BACK ON THAT TIME

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:48.262
FRAME. IT IS REALLY. SHAMEFUL

01:37:48.329 --> 01:37:52.733
THAT WILL ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:54.568
AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE DOING

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:55.069
OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:55.603
INCREASING FEES IN PEOPLE

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:56.136
BELIEVING. THAT THEY WERE

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.104
CONTRIBUTING TO THE- THE LIFE

01:37:57.171 --> 01:37:58.172
AND GROWTH OF OUR INSTITUTION

01:37:58.239 --> 01:37:59.039
THAT IT WAS A SACRIFICE THEY

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:01.075
MADE BECAUSE THEY LOVE TO SEE

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:01.809
ISSUE. BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:04.778
INSTITUTIONS OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:07.948
SO WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THIS IT.

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.383
IT MAKES ME VERY SAD. TO

01:38:09.450 --> 01:38:10.918
BELIEVE THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:12.086
THAT NOT CARE AS MUCH ABOUT OUR

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:13.721
STAFF AND OUR FACULTY AS THE

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:16.590
CURE ABOUT THE INSTITUTION. AND

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:17.791
THIS IS A SHAMEFUL MOMENT I

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.860
THINK IN CALIFORNIA OF MANY OF

01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:21.395
OUR EMPLOYEES OF COUNSEL HE

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:22.930
SAID THERE'S A ONE POINT

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:23.697
SOMEBODY BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:25.499
AND MOST OF US THAT. ONCE AGAIN

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.601
ANOTHER CONSPIRACY THEORY AND

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:28.969
WE DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH WITH

01:38:29.036 --> 01:38:31.038
IT AS WE SHOULD HAVE AND AS WE

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:32.406
BEGIN TO LOOK AT IT THEY WERE

01:38:32.473 --> 01:38:33.841
BECAUSE THEY WERE RIGHT. THEY

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.042
HAD BEEN FOLLOWING IT AND THEY

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:37.511
KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:40.948
MORE THAN ANYTHING I REGRET. OF

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:42.816
WHAT WE'VE DONE. ANDI LIKE I

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:44.685
SAID IN OUR ATTENDED MEETINGS

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:45.886
AFTER MEETINGS AS ITS CHAIR OF

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:48.155
A DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.156
WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:52.660
THE ONLY THING THAT WE COULD

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.928
DO. TO SAVE THE SEA ISSUE. AND

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:58.966
OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT. THANK YOU

01:41:45.966 --> 01:41:47.501
HER THROUGH THE JOINT

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:48.068
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE

01:41:48.135 --> 01:41:49.269
ASKING US TO LOOK AT TWO

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:50.938
DIFFERENT THINGS ONE WAS

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.739
LOOKING AT THE PARKING ISSUES

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:55.175
AT FOR VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.977
THEN ALSO LOOKING AT THE USE OF

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:58.278
OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS WHICH A

01:41:58.345 --> 01:41:59.813
LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED THIS YES

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:02.082
YOU DO. A FEW YEARS AGO SEVERAL

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:03.350
YEARS AGO BUT THEN EXPANDED IT

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.853
A FEW YEARS AGO. SO WE LOOKED

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:08.822
AT THOSE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES.

01:42:08.889 --> 01:42:09.423
I'M GOING TO VERY BRIEFLY GO

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.058
OVER. THE KEY FINDINGS KEY

01:42:11.124 --> 01:42:12.125
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE IN

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:13.760
THE AUDIT REPORT. MYSTICALLY

01:42:13.827 --> 01:42:14.695
TELL US IS GONNA STEP YOU

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:16.597
THROUGH A HAND OUT THAT THE

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.599
SERGEANTS I BELIEVE HAVE HAVE

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:19.800
DISTRIBUTED TO THE VARIOUS

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:20.901
MEMBERS. THOSE HANDOUTS

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.536
HOPEFULLY WILL L. ILLUSTRATE

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:23.837
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'M

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:26.874
GOING TO PRESENT. TO THE TO YOU

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:27.574
MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:30.244
COMMITTEES. AS WELL AS WE

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:31.912
CONCLUDED IN THE REPORT WE

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:34.681
BELIEVE THAT'S THE ISSUE FAILED

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:35.315
TO FULLY DISCLOSE THE ONE POINT

01:42:35.382 --> 01:42:37.885
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. NOW MR

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:38.452
MEDINA I KNOW YOU MENTIONED

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:39.820
THAT THERE WAS SOME DISCLOSURE

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:40.921
AND WE WILL EXPLAIN THAT THERE

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:42.923
WAS SOME DISCLOSURE. OF A FOUR

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:46.460
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. BUT

01:42:46.527 --> 01:42:48.595
THAT SURPLUS IS AS WE DO IN

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:50.264
THEIR AUDIT REPORT IS SPLIT

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.632
BETWEEN SPINES THAT ARE CLEARLY

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.500
RESTRICTED FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:55.602
SO IF THEY COLLECT FEES FOR

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.070
STUDENT DEVELOPMENT CENTER

01:42:57.137 --> 01:42:59.306
STUDENT HOUSING. THOSE FUNDS

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:00.541
ARE RESTRICTED SO WE HAVE A

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:01.742
FIGURE IN THE REPORT THAT

01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:03.777
DEMONSTRATES THAT THERE IS TWO

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:04.444
BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:07.915
SPECIFICALLY RESTRICTED BY. THE

01:43:07.981 --> 01:43:09.316
COLLECTION OF THOSE PARTICULAR

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.785
FUNDS BUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:13.420
EQUATION THE OTHER TWO BILLION

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:17.558
DOLLARS. IS MONEY THAT WE

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:20.260
LOOKED AT AND THE CSU HAS

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:21.962
ESSENTIALLY BROKEN THAT TWO

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:24.932
BILLION DOLLARS DOWN INTO SOME

01:43:24.998 --> 01:43:25.966
RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:27.467
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:28.702
MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THEN THAT

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:30.237
LEAVES US WITH A LITTLE OVER

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.439
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:34.374
THAT WE DESCRIBE AS

01:43:34.441 --> 01:43:36.276
DISCRETIONARY THEY TAKE ISSUE

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:37.878
WITH THAT. WE BELIEVE IT'S

01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:39.913
DISCRETIONARY. ESSENTIALLY

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:42.049
BASED ON THE FACT THAT THOSE

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:43.850
FUNDS ARE IN VARIOUS ACCOUNTS

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:45.719
FOR VARIOUS OF THE TWENTY THREE

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:47.988
INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:48.789
PRESIDENTS OF THOSE

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.557
INSTITUTIONS CAN REACH INTO

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:53.827
THOSE FUNDS AND USE THOSE FUNDS

01:43:53.894 --> 01:43:55.228
FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:43:55.295 --> 01:43:57.564
PURPOSES THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

01:43:57.631 --> 01:43:58.832
AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY. AND THE

01:43:58.899 --> 01:43:59.399
USE OF THAT ONE POINT FIVE

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:01.602
BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN

01:44:01.668 --> 01:44:03.103
THERE'S OF COURSE THE FOUR

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:03.670
HUNDRED MILLION THEY'VE SET

01:44:03.737 --> 01:44:06.473
ASIDE FOR RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:11.011
UNCERTAINTY. AS AS A CHAIRMAN

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:14.548
INDICATED WE LOOKED AT A TEN

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:20.354
YEAR WINDOW MEMBERS ASKED US TO

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:23.991
COVER THAT TIME FRAME SO OVER

01:44:24.057 --> 01:44:31.264
THAT TIME FRAME AS. CALIFORNIA

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:33.100
DID FROM SOME MONEY THAT CAME

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:33.634
INTO CALIFORNIA UNDER THE

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.335
RECOVERY ACT UNDER THE OBAMA

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:36.803
ADMINISTRATION SOME MONEY CAME

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:38.872
INTO CALIFORNIA SOME OF THAT

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:40.207
MONEY WENT TO HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:43.210
BUT ALL THE WHILE. THE SURPLUS

01:44:43.276 --> 01:44:45.545
AS WE CALL IT CONTINUE TO GROW

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:46.847
FROM TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALL

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:48.515
THE WAY THROUGH TWO THOUSAND

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.883
EIGHTEEN AND THERE IS AN ARE

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:51.785
ARE MINE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:44:51.852 --> 01:44:53.920
DOLLARS OF DISCRETIONARY MONEY.

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:55.455
THAT THE C. ISSUE ARE COULD BE

01:44:55.522 --> 01:44:58.058
USING TEATHER OFFSET TUITION

01:44:58.125 --> 01:45:00.227
INCREASES OR TO USE FOR

01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:03.764
WHATEVER PURPOSES THEY SEE FIT.

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:04.331
AT THE SAME TIME THIS WOULD

01:45:04.398 --> 01:45:08.301
THIS. SURPLUS WAS INCREASING

01:45:08.368 --> 01:45:09.736
THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION

01:45:09.803 --> 01:45:11.071
IN CALIFORNIA THE MEMBERS A

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:12.372
LEGISLATURE CALIFORNIA IS DOING

01:45:12.439 --> 01:45:15.242
BETTER THAT WAS RECOVERING SO

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:16.109
THAT APPROPRIATION REALLY

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:18.812
BASICALLY. RECOVERED AND IT

01:45:18.879 --> 01:45:21.114
INCREASED ABOUT 60% OVER THE

01:45:21.181 --> 01:45:23.183
OLD THAT SAME TIME FRAME SO THE

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:24.885
CSU WAS RECEIVING ADDITIONAL

01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:26.286
INCREASES IN APPROPRIATIONS

01:45:26.353 --> 01:45:28.021
FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:45:28.088 --> 01:45:29.456
CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:31.224
AT THAT TIME BUT AT THE SAME

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:34.061
TIME THIS SURPLUS. CONTINUE TO

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:35.562
GROW AS I SAID OVER THAT TEN

01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:38.899
YEAR WINDOW 4100% OUR ISSUE

01:45:38.965 --> 01:45:40.801
WITH DISCLOSURE AND THE GRAPHIC

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:42.102
THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT MR

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:43.770
CLEATS US WILL STEP YOU THROUGH

01:45:43.837 --> 01:45:45.605
REALLY DOES EXPLAIN OTHER

01:45:45.672 --> 01:45:47.374
CONCERNS WE HAVE THERE A COUPLE

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.375
OF REPORTS THAT WE REALLY ARE

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:49.843
GOING TO HIGHLIGHT ONE.

01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:52.012
CRITICAL REPORT IS CALLED THE

01:45:52.079 --> 01:45:53.480
WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:56.850
ACT REQUIRE CS YOU TO CONSULT

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:58.452
WITH STUDENTS IS THE STUDENT

01:45:58.518 --> 01:46:00.287
ASSOCIATION IN THE EVENT THERE

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:02.589
CONSIDERING A TUITION INCREASE.

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:03.690
AND THERE ARE VARIOUS REAP

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.358
REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:07.527
INCLUDED IN THAT CONSULTATION.

01:46:07.594 --> 01:46:09.696
AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS IS.

01:46:09.763 --> 01:46:10.831
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE

01:46:10.897 --> 01:46:13.333
ANY ALTERNATIVES TO INCREASING

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.770
TUITION. SO WHEN CSU APPROACH

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.004
TO STUDENT ASSOCIATION THEY

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:19.940
GAVE THEM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.241
DIFFERENT OPTIONS WE HOPEFULLY

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:21.808
CAN GET MORE MONEY FROM THE

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:24.211
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:25.512
GONNA HAVE IF WE DON'T WE'RE

01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:26.947
GONNA HAVE TO RAISE TUITION IF

01:46:27.013 --> 01:46:29.382
WE DON'T DO GET EITHER OF THOSE

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:31.451
WE WILL HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:32.819
WHAT THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE IN

01:46:32.886 --> 01:46:34.087
THAT REPORT OR TO THE STUDENT

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.523
ASSOCIATION IS. THEY HAD ONE

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.859
POINT FOUR BILLION AT THAT TIME

01:46:38.925 --> 01:46:40.894
IN THIS AND OUR WORDS A

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:43.063
DISCRETIONARY ACCOUNT IN THIS

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:44.531
INVESTMENT ACCOUNT THAT WAS

01:46:44.598 --> 01:46:46.466
AVAILABLE FOR USE SO THEY

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:48.935
SHOULD HAVE IN OUR MINDS SHARE

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:50.036
THAT INFORMATION WITH THE

01:46:50.103 --> 01:46:52.339
STUDENT ASSOCIATION. SO THEN

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.006
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN THE

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.574
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO KEEP

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:55.809
THAT MONEY IN RESERVE BECAUSE

01:46:55.876 --> 01:46:56.977
WE'RE SETTING IT ASIDE FOR

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:57.911
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE

01:46:57.978 --> 01:46:59.513
SITTING INSIDE FOR EMERGENCIES

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:01.047
IT CETERA BUT THE DISCUSSION

01:47:01.114 --> 01:47:02.749
NEVER TOOK PLACE AND THAT'S

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:05.519
BECAUSE THAT INFORMATION WAS

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:06.086
NOT DISCLOSED TO THE STUDENT

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:08.755
ASSOCIATION. ANOTHER KEY REPORT

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:11.691
THAT THE CSU IS REQUIRED TO

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.426
PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE. IS

01:47:13.493 --> 01:47:14.728
THE ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:16.530
PLAN AND THIS IS A PLAN THAT

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:18.498
WAS IN THE BUDGET ACT REQUIRED

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:20.333
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE CSU IS

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.135
SUPPOSED TO. PROVIDE TO THE

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:23.370
LEGISLATURE ANY AND ALL

01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:24.671
RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE

01:47:24.738 --> 01:47:26.907
AVAILABLE TO PAY THEIR EXPENSES

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:29.476
AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER. REPORT

01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:30.944
THAT WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:33.413
SEE DISCLOSURE OF THE FOUR

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:34.881
BILLION AND THEN POTENTIALLY

01:47:34.948 --> 01:47:36.183
BREAKING THAT FOUR BILLION OUT

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.051
TO SEEK TO EXPLAIN. SOME OF

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:39.719
THAT IS DEFINITELY RESTRICTED

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:41.888
MONEY WE CANNOT USE IT FOR ANY.

01:47:41.955 --> 01:47:43.657
PARTICULAR EIGHT WE HAVE TO USE

01:47:43.723 --> 01:47:45.458
IT FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE BUT

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:47.127
HERE'S A POT OF MONEY WHERE WE

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:49.396
HAVE. A MORE FLEXIBILITY SO WE

01:47:49.462 --> 01:47:50.964
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO HAVE

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:52.999
SEEN THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:54.668
AND INCLUSION IN THE IN THE

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:55.969
REPORT THAT CAME TO THE

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:57.370
LEGISLATURE. THOSE ARE A COUPLE

01:47:57.437 --> 01:47:59.105
OF EXAMPLES THAT WE HAD

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:01.541
CONCERNS ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:02.275
SHARING WITH BOTH THE

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:04.077
LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY WITH

01:48:04.144 --> 01:48:07.647
THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. NOW WE

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:08.882
ARE NOT AS A STATE AUDITOR'S

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:10.150
OFFICE GOING TO ARGUE THAT

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:11.518
HAVING A RESERVE ISN'T A

01:48:11.585 --> 01:48:13.386
PRUDENT THING TO DO ABSOLUTELY

01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:15.355
IT'S A PRUDENT THING TO DO. BUT

01:48:15.422 --> 01:48:16.790
WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE CS USE

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:19.259
RESERVE POLICY WE DIDN'T SEE A

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:22.028
LOT OF THE PARAMETERS OR THE

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:22.863
INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:24.764
INCLUDED IN A RESERVE POLICY.

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:25.932
AND WILL STEP YOU THROUGH

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:27.500
ANOTHER ELEMENT IN THE GRAPHICS

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:28.702
THAT WE HANDED OUT THAT

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:30.403
COMPARES SEE ISSUES POLICY TO

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:32.539
WHAT. THE LEGISLATURE ARE PUT

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:34.140
TOGETHER WHEN WE CREATED THE

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:36.309
RAINY DAY FUND AND A RESERVE

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.645
ESSENTIALLY FOR ECONOMIC ACT.

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:39.813
UNCERTAINTY AS FAR AS

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.848
PARAMETERS. RESERVE POLICY

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:43.283
SHOULD ESTABLISH WHAT'S THE

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.118
MINIMUM RESERVE WE WANT TO

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.519
ESTABLISH WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM

01:48:46.586 --> 01:48:48.688
RESERVE. IS THEY'RE REPORTING

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:50.323
ON IF WE DEPEND TO THE RESERVE

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:51.057
WHAT ARE WE USING THOSE FUNDS

01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:54.194
FOR. WHAT'S THE AUTHORITY WHO

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:55.462
HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DIP INTO

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:57.063
THE RESERVE AND ULTIMATELY WHO

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:58.531
DECIDES HOW THAT MONEY SHOULD

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:01.034
BE USED AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE SO

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:02.769
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:04.638
THAT WE WOULD EXPECTEDTO SEE

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.273
IN A RESERVE POLICY THAT WE DID

01:49:06.339 --> 01:49:08.475
NOT SEE. IN THE POLICY THAT SEE

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:10.911
ISSUE CURRENTLY HAS SO WE THINK

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:12.479
THERE ARE AREAS THAT THIS ISSUE

01:49:12.545 --> 01:49:13.880
CERTAINLY COULD COULD

01:49:13.947 --> 01:49:15.315
STRENGTHEN WITH RESPECT TO

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:16.883
THEIR RESERVE POLICY ANOTHER

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.451
POINT IS THE RESERVE FOR

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:19.452
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOUR

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:21.454
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF.

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:24.157
THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION.

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:26.059
THERE IS NO PARAMETER AROUND

01:49:26.126 --> 01:49:27.160
THE RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:28.094
UNCERTAINTY THERE'S NO

01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:30.163
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT FOUR

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.665
HUNDRED MILLION. AND THE OTHER

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:32.999
ONE POINT ONE I MEAN BILLION

01:49:33.066 --> 01:49:35.602
DOLLARS THAT THAT IS INCLUDED

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:36.870
THAT COMES TOGETHER FOR THE ONE

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:38.004
POINT FIVE SO YOU'VE GOT ONE

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:39.539
POINT FIVE SURPLUS. THEY WILL

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:41.041
SUGGEST TO YOU FOUR HUNDRED

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:42.409
MILLION IS RESERVE ECONOMIC

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:43.843
UNCERTAINTY THAT LEAVES YOU ONE

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.578
POINT ONE BILLION. BUT THERE IS

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:47.380
NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE

01:49:47.447 --> 01:49:48.648
TWO AMOUNTS WHEN WE LOOKED AT

01:49:48.715 --> 01:49:50.684
POLICIES PROCEDURES HOW ARE YOU

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:52.686
GOING TO USE ECONOMIC THE FUNDS

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:53.687
FOR A RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.088
UNCERTAINTY. THERE IS NO

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.356
DISTINCTION AND THERE NEEDS TO

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:58.425
BE CLARIFICATION IN THE EVENT

01:49:58.491 --> 01:49:59.859
THEY WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:01.094
RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC

01:50:01.161 --> 01:50:03.763
UNCERTAINTY. AND THEN HAVE YOU

01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:05.632
ADDITIONAL SURPLUS FUNDS A

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:06.666
FURTHER THAT THEY THEY'RE

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:07.767
SETTING ASIDE FOR OTHER

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:09.669
PURPOSES SO THEY REALLY NEED TO

01:50:09.736 --> 01:50:11.404
STRENGTHEN SOME OF THEIR

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:11.905
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:14.574
SURROUNDING THAT. THE OTHER

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.042
ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED AS THERE

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:18.011
WAS NOT. A LOT OF REPORTING

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:20.447
BACK TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:21.781
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

01:50:21.848 --> 01:50:23.550
STATE REQUIRES IS AN ANNUAL

01:50:23.616 --> 01:50:25.218
REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THE

DAY FUND AND RESERVES FOR THE

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.422
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S NO

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:31.858
REQUIREMENT THAT THE C. ISSUE

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.159
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REPORT

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.260
TO THE TRUSTEES ON AN ANNUAL

01:50:34.327 --> 01:50:35.729
BASIS HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN

01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:37.163
RESERVE. HOW MUCH MONEY IS IN

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:38.932
SURPLUS AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:40.200
SETTING ASIDE NOW WE DID GIVE

01:50:40.266 --> 01:50:42.402
THE CSU CREDIT. THERE WAS A

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:43.770
MEETING A BOARD OF TRUSTEES

01:50:43.837 --> 01:50:45.672
MEETING IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:47.073
SEVENTEEN. WHERE THE RESERVES

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:49.075
WERE DISCUSSED. AND THEY LAID

01:50:49.142 --> 01:50:50.877
OUT SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF

01:50:50.944 --> 01:50:53.680
THEIR EXISTING POLICY AND WHAT

01:50:53.747 --> 01:50:54.314
THEIR GOALS WERE MOVING FORWARD

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:56.082
SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:57.183
THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

01:50:57.250 --> 01:50:58.918
THAT THAT IS SUBSEQUENT TO THE

01:50:58.985 --> 01:51:00.720
DECISION. FOR THE TUITION

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:02.722
INCREASED WAS VOTED ON BY THE

01:51:02.789 --> 01:51:04.724
BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THE MARCH

01:51:04.791 --> 01:51:05.525
TWENTY SEVENTEEN MEETING. THERE

01:51:05.592 --> 01:51:07.427
WAS NO DISCUSSION THAT I SAW

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:08.928
WHEN I WATCH THE BOARD EETING.

01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:10.864
ABOUT ANY KIND OF RESERVES ARE

01:51:10.930 --> 01:51:11.798
ANY SURPLUS AVAILABLE TO

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:15.135
OFFSET. NOW AT THE JANUARY

01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:15.668
TWENTY SEVENTEEN BOARD OF

01:51:15.735 --> 01:51:16.569
TRUSTEES THERE WAS SOME

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.304
DISCUSSION. BECAUSE THERE WERE

01:51:18.371 --> 01:51:20.407
QUESTIONS FROM THE TRUSTEES. IF

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:21.341
WE DON'T GET THE AMOUNT OF

01:51:21.408 --> 01:51:22.609
APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:23.910
LEGISLATURE THAT WE NEED WHAT

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:25.278
ARE WE GOING TO DO. THE

01:51:25.345 --> 01:51:27.280
RESPONSE WAS WE CAN DEPEND TO

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:29.249
SOME. SOME FUNDS THAT WE HAVE

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:30.984
THAT WE TYPICALLY USE FOR NON

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:33.453
RECURRING. EXPENSES SO THERE

01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.921
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A-

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:37.023
DISCUSSION NOT REALLY

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.391
SUGGESTING THAT WE HAVE ONE

01:51:38.458 --> 01:51:40.960
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. IN THAT

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:41.561
ACCOUNT. SO WE COULD JUST TAP

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:44.864
INTO THAT. COM BUT THERE WAS

01:51:44.931 --> 01:51:46.466
SOME DISCUSSION BUT THERE HAS

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:48.668
NOT BEEN A REGULAR ROUTINE.

01:51:48.735 --> 01:51:50.270
CONVERSATION WITH THE BOARD OF

01:51:50.336 --> 01:51:52.472
TRUSTEES ABOUT THE RESERVE THE

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:54.274
RESERVE POLICY AND THE AMOUNT

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:56.910
OF MONEY THAT. THE CSU

01:51:56.976 --> 01:51:57.377
CURRENTLY HAS IN THAT

01:51:57.444 --> 01:52:00.914
PARTICULAR RESERVE. SO WE HAVE

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:01.815
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.650
RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'M GOING

01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:05.418
HIGH LEVEL WE CERTAINLY WILL

01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:06.519
WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO ANSWER ANY

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:07.954
PARTICULAR QUESTIONS I WANT TO

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:09.622
ALLOW TIME FOR MR COOLEY TELLS

01:52:09.689 --> 01:52:10.990
TO STEP YOU THROUGH. OTHER

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:12.692
GRAPHICS THAT WE HANDED OUT SO

01:52:12.759 --> 01:52:14.694
REALLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS FLOW

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:16.663
WITH FROM THE FINDINGS I JUST

01:52:16.729 --> 01:52:18.231
DISCUSSED THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.999
MORE TRANSPARENCY THEY HAVE TO

01:52:20.066 --> 01:52:22.102
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO

01:52:22.168 --> 01:52:22.836
RELEVANT PARTIES THE

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:24.471
LEGISLATURE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:25.805
FINANCE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:27.173
BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND REALLY

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.575
DISTINGUISH THE VARIOUS

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.477
BALANCES IN THOSE DIFFERENT

01:52:30.543 --> 01:52:32.011
ACCOUNTS AND CERTAINLY THE

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.580
DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS THAT THAT

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:35.748
THE CSU IS ACCUMULATED AN

01:52:35.815 --> 01:52:38.351
IMPORTANT POINT IS MUCH OF THE

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:40.386
IS THIS DISCRETIONARY MONEY IS

01:52:40.453 --> 01:52:43.523
TUITION MONEY AND THAT'S

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:44.157
BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:47.660
ALLOWED. LEGISLATION TO ALLOW

01:52:47.727 --> 01:52:48.261
THIS YEAR'S YOU TO INVEST IN

01:52:48.328 --> 01:52:49.195
OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS. THEY SAID

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:50.296
YOU'RE NOT USING GENERAL FUND

01:52:50.363 --> 01:52:52.632
APPROPRIATION TO INVEST YOU'RE

01:52:52.699 --> 01:52:53.867
GOING TO USE THAT TO PAY FOR

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:55.602
EXPENSES OF THE SEA ISSUE SO

01:52:55.668 --> 01:52:57.537
ANY FUNDING THAT'S LEFT OVER.

01:52:57.604 --> 01:52:59.272
TYPICALLY IS COMING FROM

01:52:59.339 --> 01:53:01.141
TUITION SO MOST OF THE MONEY IN

01:53:01.207 --> 01:53:03.409
THAT SURPLUS DISCRETIONARY

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:03.943
ACCOUNT. WAS GENERATED BY

01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:07.680
TUITION. NOW KEEP THAT IN MIND

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:10.617
THE TUITION INCREASE IN TWENTY

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:11.184
SEVENTEEN GENERATED SEVENTY

01:53:11.251 --> 01:53:14.187
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THE

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:15.221
RESERVE AMOUNT THAT

01:53:15.288 --> 01:53:16.723
DISCRETIONARY AMOUNT INCREASED

01:53:16.789 --> 01:53:18.258
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION

01:53:18.324 --> 01:53:20.894
DOLLARS FROM STE SIXTEEN

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:23.530
SEVENTEEN TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:24.097
WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THEY

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:26.566
RAISE TUITION AND- FOR STUDENTS

01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:28.601
AND GENERATED ABOUT SEVENTY

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:29.569
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO

01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:30.537
PUT THAT IN A LITTLE BIT OF

01:53:30.603 --> 01:53:32.539
PERSPECTIVE SO WHAT WE'RE

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:33.072
SUGGESTING IN ALL OF THESE

01:53:33.139 --> 01:53:35.542
RECOMMENDATIONS IS. MORE

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:37.243
TRANSPARENCY MORE DISCLOSURE

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:39.646
MORE DISCUSSION ANNUAL

01:53:39.712 --> 01:53:40.246
REPORTING TO THE BORDER REGION

01:53:40.313 --> 01:53:42.382
I MEAN THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:44.851
MAKING SURE THAT. THE

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:47.187
INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT

01:53:47.253 --> 01:53:47.720

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:49.455
OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS ON A

01:53:49.522 --> 01:53:51.191
PARTICULARLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:53.226
OPERATING EXPENSES THE

01:53:53.293 --> 01:53:54.594
DISCRETIONARY AMOUNTS AS REALLY

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.629
DISTINGUISHABLE SO THAT PEOPLE

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.331
UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MONEY IS

01:53:58.398 --> 01:53:59.699
THERE SO THAT THE CONVERSATION

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:01.100
CAN HAPPEN WE'RE NOT

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:02.802
NECESSARILY SUGGESTING THAT

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:04.003
YOU'RE GOING TO DIP INTO YOUR

01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:05.405
RESERVE TO KEEP YOUR OPERATIONS

YEAR EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

01:54:08.374 --> 01:54:09.876
KNOWS THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE.

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:11.744
BUT YOU NEED TO DISCLOSE THAT

01:54:11.811 --> 01:54:13.479
INFORMATION SO YOU CAN HAVE THE

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:15.215

SHOULD OUR AUDIT REPORTER

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:43.009
SHORTLY BEFORE IN AND IT'S

01:54:43.076 --> 01:54:45.578
HELPFUL WE DO SAY IT'S NOT IT

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:46.946
DOESN'T HAVE SPECIFIC ENOUGH

01:54:47.013 --> 01:54:48.147
INFORMATION IT'S A STEP IN THE

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:50.016
RIGHT DIRECTION ABSOLUTELY. BUT

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:51.184
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THERE

01:54:51.251 --> 01:54:52.685
NEEDS TO BE MORE SPECIFICITY

01:54:52.752 --> 01:54:55.355
ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE VARIOUS

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.090
REVENUE REVENUE THAT'S

01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:58.958
GENERATED THE SOURCE OF THE

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:00.860
ACTUAL SURPLUS WHAT IS FEEDING

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:03.630
INTO THAT SURPLUS. REPORTING

01:55:03.696 --> 01:55:04.831
ANNUALLY TO THE BOARD OF

01:55:04.897 --> 01:55:06.299
TRUSTEES ENSURING THE

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:07.300
INFORMATION IS EASILY

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:08.868
ACCESSIBLE ON THE WEBSITE TOOK

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:10.370
JUST A LOT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY

01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:13.339
AND BEING VERY VERY SPECIFIC.

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:14.874
SO THAT'S KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL

01:55:14.941 --> 01:55:16.409
DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES WE HAD

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:19.679
WITH RESPECT TO THE SURPLUS

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:22.115
THAT WE BELIEVE THE ONE POINT

01:55:22.181 --> 01:55:22.715
FIVE BILLION THAT THEY DID NOT

01:55:22.782 --> 01:55:25.551
FULLY DISCLOSE. OUGHT TO

01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:26.653
STAKEHOLDERS THE LEGISLATURE

01:55:26.719 --> 01:55:28.588
AND STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR THE

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:30.023
OTHER ASPECT OF THE AUDIT THAT

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:32.058
THAT IS QUIRK SILVA ASKED US TO

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:34.127
LOOK AT WAS PARKING AND WHETHER

01:55:34.193 --> 01:55:35.595
OR NOT THE CSU SYSTEM WAS

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.196
REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB OF NOT

01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:38.431
ONLY PLANNING FOR PARKING

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:39.966
FACILITIES. BUT CONSIDERING

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:40.900
ALTERNATE MODES OF

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:42.869
TRANSPORTATION OTHER OPTIONS

01:55:42.935 --> 01:55:44.304
FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO

01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:45.538
ACCESS THEIR RESPECTIVE

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:48.474
CAMPUSES AND WE FOUND THAT WE

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.242
VISITED FOUR DIFFERENT

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:50.977
UNIVERSITIES CHANNEL ISLANDS

01:55:51.044 --> 01:55:52.178
FULLERTON SACRAMENTO AND SAN

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:55.181
DIEGO AND WE REALLY FOUND THAT.

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:55.648
BASICALLY A LOT OF THE

01:55:55.715 --> 01:55:58.084
UNIVERSITIES WERE JUST.

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:58.651
ESSENTIALLY DECIDING THEY

01:55:58.718 --> 01:56:00.153
NEEDED TO BUILD FACILITIES AND

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:01.654
THEY WEREN'T REALLY DOING THEIR

01:56:01.721 --> 01:56:03.389
DUE DILIGENCE AS FAR AS MAKING

01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:04.657
SURE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:06.759
OTHER OPTIONS. AND INCLUDING IN

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:08.494
THEIR PLANS HERE THE

01:56:08.561 --> 01:56:10.596
ALTERNATIVES THAT WE CONSIDERED

01:56:10.663 --> 01:56:12.031
HERE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE OR

01:56:12.098 --> 01:56:14.500
TRYING TO IMPLEMENT. THOSE IN

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:15.735
CONJUNCTION WE STILL NEED TO

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:18.671
BUILD FACILITIES. WE WEREN'T

01:56:18.738 --> 01:56:20.206
SEEING ROBUST ANALYSIS WITH

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:22.075
RESPECT TO THAT WE ALSO SAW

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:23.843
THAT SOME OF THE FACILITY SOME

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.178
OF THE CAMPUSES CHOSE TO BUILD

01:56:25.244 --> 01:56:27.380
FACILITIES. THAT RESULTED IN

01:56:27.447 --> 01:56:28.815
STUDENTS PAYING HIGHER PERMIT

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:31.617
FEES AND AS AS MR SALAS

01:56:31.684 --> 01:56:33.319
MENTIONED THAT SAN DIEGO STATE

01:56:33.386 --> 01:56:35.088
THE STUDENTS ARE PAYING. HIGHER

01:56:35.154 --> 01:56:37.590
PERMIT FEES FOR FACILITY THAT

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:38.791
WAS CONSTRUCTED THAT THEY DO

01:56:38.858 --> 01:56:39.792
NOT HAVE THAT NOT HAVE THE

01:56:39.859 --> 01:56:41.828
AUTHORITY TO USE. IT'S A

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:42.795
FACILITY THAT WE WAS BUILT FOR

01:56:42.862 --> 01:56:44.797
OTHER PURPOSES SINCE STUDENTS

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:46.232
CAN'T EVEN USE IT YET THEIR

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:49.302
FEES WENT UP TO PAY FOR IT. SO

01:56:49.369 --> 01:56:50.236
THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT WE

01:56:50.303 --> 01:56:52.872
IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT. AGAIN

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:54.874
THE FEES HAVE GONE UP

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:57.310
SIGNIFICANTLY ABOUT 60% AT A

01:56:57.377 --> 01:57:00.980
COUPLE CAMPUSES. THE CAPACITY

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:03.950
HAS INCREASED BUT ENROLLMENT

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:07.186
HAS OUTPACED THAT SO REALLY THE

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:09.622
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM NEEDS TO TAKE

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:11.190
A HARDER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE

01:57:11.257 --> 01:57:14.727
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS. THERE ARE

01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:17.063
SOME CAMPUSES THAT WE THINK ARE

01:57:17.130 --> 01:57:18.498
DOING A PARTICULARLY GOOD JOB

01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:19.932
SACRAMENTO STATE HERE AND IN

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:22.201
SACRAMENTO. REALLY HAS DONE A

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:22.869
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AT A

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:24.237
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

01:57:24.303 --> 01:57:25.705
THEY COLLECT DATA WITH RESPECT

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:26.506
TO THE USE OF THEIR PARKING

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:27.974
FACILITIES THEY NEED TO DO A

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:28.741
BETTER JOB OF ANALYZING SOME OF

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:30.676
THAT DATA. BUT WE THINK THEY

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:31.944
THEY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:32.578
THAN SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES

01:57:32.645 --> 01:57:35.648
THAT WE VISITED. A COUPLE OF

01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:36.716
OTHER ISSUES AND I'LL I'LL GO

01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:37.483
TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS REAL

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.984
QUICK AND THEN I'LL HAVE

01:57:38.050 --> 01:57:38.618
MYSTICALLY SO STEP YOU THROUGH

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:39.252
THE GRAPHICS. IS THE THERE'S A

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:40.052
REQUIREMENT THAT EACH OF THE

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:40.586
CAMPUS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

01:57:40.653 --> 01:57:42.088
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. AND

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:42.922
THAT COMMITTEE SHOULD INCLUDE

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:44.424
REPRESENTATIVES OF STUDENTS

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.625
FACULTY STAFF FROM THE

01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:47.326
UNIVERSITY. OF THE RESPECTIVE

01:57:47.393 --> 01:57:48.895
UNIVERSITY WE DIDN'T SEE THAT

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:51.130
AT EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION WE

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.398
ALSO DIDN'T SEE THERE WASN'T A

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:54.434
LOT OF GUIDANCE AS TO. THE MAKE

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:55.902
UP OF THE COMMITTEE HOW OFTEN

01:57:55.968 --> 01:57:57.370
THE COMMITTEE SHOULD MEET. WE

01:57:57.437 --> 01:57:58.838
FOUND THAT SOME CAMPUSES THERE

01:57:58.905 --> 01:57:59.972
THE COMMITTEES WERE NOT MEETING

01:58:00.039 --> 01:58:02.275
REGULARLY SO THEY NEED TO DO A

01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:04.143
BETTER JOB OF REALLY FOCUSING

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:05.845
ON SOME OF THE OPTIONS WITH

01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:08.080
RESPECT TO. TRYING TO IDENTIFY

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:10.950
ALL ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:11.484
MODES ALTERNATIVE WAYS FOR

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:14.520
STUDENTS TO GET THE CAMPUS. ONE

01:58:14.587 --> 01:58:15.621
DIFFICULTY THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE

01:58:15.688 --> 01:58:17.256
IN THE REPORT IS THE REVENUE

01:58:17.323 --> 01:58:19.459
STREAM. FOR ALTERNATIVE

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:21.828
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THEY

01:58:21.894 --> 01:58:23.162
ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED THEY CAN

01:58:23.229 --> 01:58:25.364
USE PARKING FINES. SO YOUR

01:58:25.431 --> 01:58:26.833
STUDENTS COME THE CAMPUS THEY

01:58:26.899 --> 01:58:28.601
PARK AND THEY GET. A TICKET

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:30.736
THEY'RE FINE FOR BEING PARKING

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:32.505
IN THEIR PRO INAPPROPRIATE

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:34.941
SPACE. THAT'S THE MONEY THAT

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.209
THE CAMPUS IS AT THIS POINT ARE

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:39.212
ABLE TO USE. TO FIND SOME OF

01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:41.147
THOSE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS TO

01:58:41.214 --> 01:58:42.048
THE EXTENT THEY HAVE ANY

01:58:42.114 --> 01:58:44.417
PARKING REVENUE. A LEFT OVER

01:58:44.484 --> 01:58:46.385
FROM PAYING FOR MAINTENANCE AND

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:47.854
THEIR FACILITIES THEIR THEIR

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.222
DEBT BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES ARE

01:58:49.288 --> 01:58:51.090
TAKEN OUT OF BOND. NOT TO PAY

01:58:51.157 --> 01:58:52.425
FOR THE FACILITY IF THERE IS

01:58:52.492 --> 01:58:54.360
SOME SURPLUS REVENUE THEY CAN

01:58:54.427 --> 01:58:55.261
USE SOME OF THAT FOR THE

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:56.929
ALTERNATIVE. TRANSPORTATION

01:58:56.996 --> 01:58:58.898
PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE CAMPS

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:00.366
IS DO YOU HAVE A SURPLUS IN

01:59:00.433 --> 01:59:02.635
THOSE. SO THEY COULD USE SOME

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.504
OF THAT MONEY BUT IT'S NOT HUGE

01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:05.438
IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:10.843
MONEY. OUGHT TO PUT TOWARDS.

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:11.444
THESE ALTER OUR TRANSPORTATION

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:15.381
PROGRAMS. SO QUICKLY SOME OF

01:59:15.448 --> 01:59:15.948
THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE

01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:16.883
WITH RESPECT TO THIS IS JUST

01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:19.085
REALLY DEVELOPING MORE ROBUST

01:59:19.151 --> 01:59:20.286
TRANSPORTATION PLANS THE

01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:21.921
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MAKING SURE

01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:24.123
THAT. THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS

01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:26.158
THAT ARE CONSIDERING BUILDING

01:59:26.225 --> 01:59:28.027
NEW PARKING FACILITIES HAVE

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:29.428
LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:31.497
THEY'VE TRIED TO IDENTIFY WHAT

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:32.331
THOSE ALTERNATIVE

01:59:32.398 --> 01:59:33.599
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS WOULD

01:59:33.666 --> 01:59:35.768
BE WHAT WHAT IMPACT WOULD THAT

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.270
HAVE ON THE CAMPUS HOW MUCH

01:59:37.336 --> 01:59:38.871
WOULD THAT HELP. IS THERE STILL

01:59:38.938 --> 01:59:39.872
IN NEED TO BUILD THE PARKING

01:59:39.939 --> 01:59:42.208
FACILITY SO WE HAVE ALL A LOT

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:43.776
OF RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND THAT

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.344
AS FAR AS COLLECTING DATA WHICH

01:59:45.411 --> 01:59:47.547
AS I SAID SOME CAMPUSES DO. BUT

01:59:47.613 --> 01:59:48.447
THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:50.016
ANALYZING THE DATA BEFORE THEY

01:59:50.082 --> 01:59:51.784
TAKE THE NEXT STEP. IN MAKING A

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:53.286
DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:54.720
NOT THEY NEED TO BUILD A

01:59:54.787 --> 01:59:55.321
FACILITY AND HOW HELPFUL WOULD

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:57.990
THAT BE. SO I'M NOT GOING TO

01:59:58.057 --> 01:59:59.325
BELABOR GOING INTO ALL OF THE

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:00.593
RECOMMENDATIONS I CERTAINLY CAN

02:00:08.701 --> 02:00:10.603
GRAPHICS AND THAT WE HAVE THAT

02:00:10.670 --> 02:00:13.105
HOPEFULLY WILL WILL ILLUSTRATE.

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:16.208
IN A LITTLE BIT BETTER FORM.

02:00:16.275 --> 02:00:18.477

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:03.990
HELD. AND IF THE QUESTION IS IF

02:01:04.056 --> 02:01:05.091
YOU MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS FOR

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:06.759
CONSIDER RAISING TUITION. THE

02:01:06.826 --> 02:01:07.960
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OF THIS

02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:09.061
AMOUNT IS BASICALLY

02:01:09.128 --> 02:01:11.097
DISCRETIONARY OR OR AVAILABLE

02:01:11.163 --> 02:01:13.466
FOR ITS BASIC OPERATIONS. YOU

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:15.701
KNOW HOW MUCH THE FROM FINDING

02:01:15.768 --> 02:01:17.737
IS RELATED TUITION AND HOW MUCH

02:01:17.803 --> 02:01:18.371
OF IT HAS GROWN OVER TIME HOW

02:01:18.437 --> 02:01:19.905
MUCH OF HIS RESERVE. NONE OF

02:01:19.972 --> 02:01:21.040
THESE REPORTS WOULD HAVE THAT

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.541
KIND OF INFORMATION WHICH WE

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:23.342
BELIEVE WOULD BE RELEVANT IN

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:25.311
THOSE TYPE OF DECISIONS. THE

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:26.912
FIRST TWO ROWS BACKING

02:01:26.979 --> 02:01:28.781
SUSTAINABILITY PLANET TUITION

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:30.449
PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION.

02:01:30.516 --> 02:01:31.751
BASICALLY THOSE ARE THE TWO

02:01:31.817 --> 02:01:33.152
REPORTS THAT WE DISCUSSED IN

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:35.588
THE REPORT THAT WHERE CC DO NOT

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:36.422
TO FULLY DISCLOSE THAT

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:37.890
INFORMATION. THAT WE FELT WAS

02:01:37.957 --> 02:01:42.428
RELEVANT TO WIN CONSIDERING.

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:43.062
FUNDING INCREASES OR RACES INTO

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:46.866
TUITION. THERE'S THREE REPORTS

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:47.967
ON A REGULAR THOSE IN THE

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:48.868
BOTTOM THREE NOT BASICALLY

02:01:48.934 --> 02:01:50.736
THESE ARE. PRETTY ROUTINE I

02:01:50.803 --> 02:01:52.338
FINANCIAL REPORTS THAT CSU AYE

02:01:52.405 --> 02:01:53.406
PROVIDES. BASICALLY WHAT THOSE

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.041
REPORTS SHOW IS THAT TOTAL

02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:56.442
INVEST IN BALANCE AND IT'S

02:01:56.509 --> 02:01:57.743
BASICALLY THE FOUR FOUR BILLION

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:58.611
DOLLAR INVESTMENT BOUNCE WHICH

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.279
IS BASICALLY A MIX OF.

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:01.547
RESTRICTED FUNDS AND

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:02.948
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS WAS NOT

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:04.617
BROKEN OUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:05.885
HOW MUCH OF IT WAS AVAILABLE

02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:07.386
FOR ITS GENERAL OPERATIONS. IT

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:09.188
DOES NOT SHOW DISCRETIONARY NOW

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.322
TOWARD THE FACT THAT IT COMES

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:12.758
FROM TUITION. OR THOSE OTHER

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:13.993
FACTORS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:15.027
BE SAY RELEVANT ALL THAT

02:02:15.094 --> 02:02:16.028
INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:18.297
DISCLOSED IN THE TWO DOCUMENTS

02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:20.399
THAT WAS IN THE FIRST TWO ROWS

02:02:20.466 --> 02:02:20.900
THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE

02:02:20.966 --> 02:02:23.602
REPORT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE.

02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:24.603
THAT THAT'S WHAT CONSIDERATIONS

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:27.573
WERE MONEY OR WHETHER CITY

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:31.610
POTENTIAL CUTS TO SERVICES. SO

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:32.678
WE RECOMMENDED THAT C. I. C. S.

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:33.446
YOU BE DISCLOSING THAT HAVE

02:02:33.512 --> 02:02:34.513
INFORMATION TO ADD THE

02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:36.282
LEGISLATURE INTO STUDENTS WHEN

02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:37.850
CONSULTING FOR TUITION

02:02:37.917 --> 02:02:38.684
INCREASES. YOU TURN TO PAGE

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.920
THREE. ONE OF THINGS THAT CSU

02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:43.522
HAS INDICATED. IS THAT IT

02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:44.757
CONSIDERS THIS ONE POINT FIVE

02:02:44.824 --> 02:02:46.625
BILLION DOLLARS AS RESERVE YOU

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:47.927
KNOW IT'S SIMILAR TO A RAINY

02:02:47.993 --> 02:02:50.262
DAY FUND. HOWEVER WHAT OUR

02:02:50.329 --> 02:02:53.032
CONCERN IS IF CSU REALLY WANT

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:53.566
TO CONSIDER THIS RESERVE

02:02:53.632 --> 02:02:55.067
RELEASED OVER HOLLIS WAS OUR

02:02:55.134 --> 02:02:56.836
POLICY NOW ONE OF THE MODELS

02:02:56.902 --> 02:02:59.138
THAT TO IT I COULD USE. IS THE

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:01.040
STATE THE STATE ECONOMIC

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:02.007
CORPORATE SPERRY'S BEST

02:03:02.074 --> 02:03:03.275
PRACTICES RELATED TO ITS

02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:04.710
RESERVES. THAT WITHOUT THAT CC

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:06.512
DOES NOT HALF OF FOR EXAMPLE

02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:07.847
THE STATE HAS A REGULAR AND

02:03:07.913 --> 02:03:09.048
REGAIN YOUR REPORTERS ARE

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:11.383
BALANCES. IT ALSO IS VERY CLEAR

02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:12.351
HOW MUCH OF THE RESERVE IS

02:03:12.418 --> 02:03:14.286
AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL PURPOSES.

02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:15.921
HOW MUCH OF IT IS IT SHOULD BE

02:03:15.988 --> 02:03:17.423
IN THE MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:18.691
FOR ITS RAINY DAY FUND. HOW

02:03:18.758 --> 02:03:20.860
MUCH UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.728
CAN STATE USE THIS FUNDS IN

02:03:22.795 --> 02:03:24.497
CASE OF A BUDGET EMERGENCY.

02:03:24.563 --> 02:03:26.565
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT CSU

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:27.500
DOES NOT HAPPEN THIS WAS OUR

02:03:27.566 --> 02:03:29.668
POLICY DOES NOT HAVE. FOR

02:03:29.735 --> 02:03:31.437
EXAMPLE INDICATE HOW MUCH OF A

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:32.471
SURPLUS IS AVAILABLE FOR

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:34.573
DISCUSSION PURPOSES MINIMUM

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:36.142
LEVEL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OR

02:03:36.208 --> 02:03:38.644
MINIMUM BALANCE. IT DOES NOT

02:03:38.711 --> 02:03:40.112
HAVE A ADDITIONAL APPROVAL IF

02:03:40.179 --> 02:03:45.718
HE. NEEDS TO USE IT'S A RESERVE

02:03:45.785 --> 02:03:50.156
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES.

02:03:50.222 --> 02:03:51.924
THESE ARE ALL BASIC FOR PRETTY

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:53.225
STANDARD WHO'S OUR PRACTICES.

02:03:53.292 --> 02:03:53.959
THAT WE NOW WE SEE THAT THE

02:03:54.026 --> 02:03:54.894
STATE HAS WE SEE THE OTHER

02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:56.128
UNIVERSITIES HAVE. AND WE ALSO

02:03:56.195 --> 02:03:56.996
EVEN SEE THAT CALIFORNIA STATE

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:57.997
STUDENTS ASSOCIATION THE

02:03:58.063 --> 02:03:59.231
ACCESSORIES ARE POLICY AND YOU

HAVE A LOT OF THE SAFEGUARDS

02:04:00.132 --> 02:04:01.867
THIS UC'S NOT HAVE. SO WHAT WE

DEMONSTRATE HOW ARE THEY YOU

02:04:06.305 --> 02:04:08.707

THAT IS THE SAME TERMINOLOGY

02:05:23.816 --> 02:05:25.150
THAT THE MEDIA USE WHEN WE

02:05:25.217 --> 02:05:26.318

THAT EITHER WE ARE NOT

02:05:29.588 --> 02:05:30.522

SAYING AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE

02:05:34.126 --> 02:05:36.495
CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DESCRIBE

02:05:36.562 --> 02:05:37.763
IT WE'RE SAYING THEY DID NOT

02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:39.598
FULLY DISCLOSE THE ONE POINT

02:05:39.665 --> 02:05:40.933
FIVE BILLION IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:42.468
GRAPHIC THAT MR COOLEY TO US

02:05:42.534 --> 02:05:43.602
WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU SEE THE

02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:45.237
GREEN CHECK MARKS. THOSE ARE

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:49.541
THE THREE REPORTS THAT THE CSU

02:05:49.608 --> 02:05:50.376
ASSERTED THEY ASSERTED THEY

02:05:50.442 --> 02:05:52.311
THEY GAVE US THIRTY REPORTS

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:54.079
IT'S THOSE THREE REPORTS EACH

02:05:54.146 --> 02:05:56.181
OF THEM THEY GIVE US TEN YEARS

02:05:56.248 --> 02:05:58.317
WORTH SO IT'S THIRTY BUDGETARY

02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:00.819
LEGAL BASIS ONE FOR EACH OF THE

02:06:00.886 --> 02:06:02.121
TEN YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.689
ANNUAL INVESTMENT REPORT IN

02:06:03.756 --> 02:06:06.525
THOSE REPORTS THEY DO DISCLOSE

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:08.160
FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WHAT THEY

02:06:08.227 --> 02:06:10.195
DO NOT DISCLOSE IS. THE

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:13.032
COMPOSITION OF THE FOUR BILLION

02:06:13.098 --> 02:06:13.999
DOLLARS THAT TWO BILLION IS

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:16.602
RESTRICTED SOME VERY SPECIFIC

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:18.103
PURPOSES STUDENT HOUSING

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.306
STUDENT DEVELOPED A STUDENT

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:22.408
HOUSING THAT STUDENT STUDENT

02:06:22.474 --> 02:06:24.376
CENTER THOSE TYPES OF THINGS

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:26.845
NOR DID THEY DISCLOSE THAT

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:27.980
THERE WAS ANOTHER TWO BILLION

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:28.781
DOLLARS THAT WAS MORE

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.616
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING WE TOOK

02:06:30.683 --> 02:06:31.583
OUT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.552
THAT THEY WERE SUGGESTING IS.

RESERVE FOR ECONOMIC

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.288
UNCERTAINTY WE WANT TO

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:37.823
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THAT'S

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.625
WHERE WE CAME UP WITH A ONE

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:41.160
POINT FIVE ALMOST ONE POINT SIX

02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:42.361
BILLION DOLLARS WHERE WERE

02:06:42.428 --> 02:06:43.829
SUGGESTING THEY NEED TO BE MORE

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:47.099
TRANSPARENT IS WHEN THEY SHARE

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.834
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT GRAPHIC THE

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.402
TUITION PROPOSAL FOR

02:06:50.469 --> 02:06:52.071
CONSIDERATION THAT'S UNDER THE

SHARE INFORMATION WITH

02:06:57.743 --> 02:07:00.980
STUDENTS. PRIOR TO RAISING

02:07:01.046 --> 02:07:02.247
TUITION SO THAT THE STUDENTS

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:04.249
CAN BE ENGAGED IN THAT

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:07.619
CONVERSATION AND PROVIDE

02:07:07.686 --> 02:07:10.389
ALTERNATIVES TO RAISING TUITION.

02:07:10.456 --> 02:07:11.457
AND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT THEY

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:12.791
STAY SUGGESTED TO THE STUDENTS

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.126
WE THEIR NET NEED TO GET MORE

02:07:14.193 --> 02:07:15.127
MONEY FROM THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA OR WE NEED TO RAISE

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:18.397
TUITION OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:18.998
TO HAVE TO CUT PROGRAMS WHERE

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:21.367
WE MAY. NOT BE ABLE TO GET

02:07:21.433 --> 02:07:23.002
STUDENTS GRADUATED WITHIN THE

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:23.702
FOR FIVE YEARS AT A TARGET.

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:24.303
THAT CERTAIN STUDENTS HAVE IN

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:24.937
THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS IN THE

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:25.604
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS. BY NOT

02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.805
DISCLOSING THAT INFORMATION IT

02:07:26.872 --> 02:07:28.307
PRECLUDED THE ABILITY TO HAVE

02:07:28.374 --> 02:07:30.509
THAT CONVERSATION THAT WHY

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:31.477
CAN'T YOU DIP INTO THAT

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.779
RESERVE. THIS YEAR WE KNOW IT'S

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:35.447
NOT SUSTAINABLE AND WE WOULD

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.249
NOT ARGUE THAT YOU WANT TO DIP

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:38.550
INTO YOUR RESERVE YEAR AFTER

02:07:38.617 --> 02:07:40.686
YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT YOU DIDN'T

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:41.153
EVEN ALLOW TO HAVE THE

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.722
CONVERSATION THAT'S OUR CONCERN

02:07:43.789 --> 02:07:45.157
WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING. THEY'RE

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:48.293
HIDING MONEY. WE CAN USE THAT

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.029
TERM BUT WE CERTAINLY FEEL THAT

02:07:50.095 --> 02:07:54.533
THEY COULD BE. MORE TRANSPARENT

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.167
IN DISCLOSURE OF THE FUNDS THAT

02:07:55.234 --> 02:07:58.670
THEY HAVE. SO YOU WOULD JUST

02:07:58.737 --> 02:07:59.204
SAY THAT YOU WANT MORE

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:00.706
TRANSPARENCY MORE DISCLOSURE

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:02.307
SHOW ALL THE CARDS ON THE TABLE

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:03.375
TO MAKE THE CORRECT POLICY

02:08:03.442 --> 02:08:05.344
IMPLICATIONS AND SORT OF. A

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:06.712
POSSIBLE CATIONS WILL MAKE YOUR

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:08.247
LEGISLATURE RIGHT SO THE

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:09.915
CONVERSATION CAN HAPPEN ONE OF

02:08:09.982 --> 02:08:11.617
THE THINGS THAT THAT WHEN I WAS

02:08:11.683 --> 02:08:12.551
WATCHING SOME OF THE BOARD OF

02:08:12.618 --> 02:08:14.253
TRUSTEE MEETINGS. SOME OF THE

02:08:14.319 --> 02:08:16.488
BOARD OF TRUSTEE MEMBER SAID WE

02:08:16.555 --> 02:08:19.058
NEED TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS

02:08:19.124 --> 02:08:20.392
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE IT'S

02:08:20.459 --> 02:08:22.394
ALL ABOUT CHOICE. WE HAVE TO

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:24.930
MAKE CHOICES DO WE CHOOSE AND

02:08:24.997 --> 02:08:25.998
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION

02:08:26.065 --> 02:08:28.467
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET INTO.

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:30.135
HOW MUCH WAS IN RESERVE THERE

02:08:30.202 --> 02:08:31.470
WASN'T DISCLOSURE TO THE

02:08:31.537 --> 02:08:32.371
TRUSTEES AT THAT PARTICULAR

02:08:32.438 --> 02:08:34.506
MEETING I WATCHED. THAT WE HAVE

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:36.008
ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

02:08:36.075 --> 02:08:37.476
IN IN A RESERVE ACCOUNT OR IN

02:08:37.543 --> 02:08:40.379
OUR INVESTMENT ACCOUNT. BUT BUT

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:41.947
IT WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT WE

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:43.182
HAVE TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT

02:08:43.248 --> 02:08:44.583
CHOICES AND SOMETIMES WE MAKE

02:08:44.650 --> 02:08:45.984
MAKE DECISIONS TO INCREASE

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:47.553
TUITION. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

02:08:47.619 --> 02:08:50.089
TO CUT PROGRAMS OUR CONCERN IS

02:08:50.155 --> 02:08:52.124
YOUR ONLY HEARING. PART OF THE

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:54.026
INFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:08:54.093 --> 02:08:55.360
THAT INFORMED DECISION AND TO

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:57.196
MAKE THE BEST CHOICE. IN THE

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:58.363
INTEREST OF THE STUDENTS TO THE

02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:59.798
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:01.233
CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE AS THEY TO

02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:02.267
CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO OUR

02:09:02.334 --> 02:09:04.336
CSU SYSTEM. THANK YOU I

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.737
APPRECIATE YOU BREAKING DOWN

02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:07.372
THE FOUR BILLION. EXACTLY HOW

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:10.109
THAT. IS DIVIDED UP NOW EARLIER

02:09:10.175 --> 02:09:12.578
WE HAD TALKED ABOUT AND THE

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:13.178
REASON WHY THIS IS RELEVANT TO

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:16.548
THIS. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT.

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:17.549
THERE WAS TUITION MONEY THAT

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:19.118
CONTRIBUTED TO. TO THE SURPLUS

02:09:19.184 --> 02:09:20.252
RIGHT AND MR CLETUS CAN ASSIST

02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:21.553
ME WITH THIS BUT BUT IT'S MY

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.222
UNDERSTANDING AS I SAID THE

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:25.190
STATUTE THAT ALLOW THE CSU OR

02:09:25.257 --> 02:09:26.892
GAVE THE CSU MORE AUTHORITY TO

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:28.894
INVEST IN OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS. AND

02:09:28.961 --> 02:09:30.562
CERTAINLY INVEST IN AND HIGHER

02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:32.598
RISK SECURITIES AND HOPEFUL AND

02:09:32.664 --> 02:09:33.232
HOPES THAT WE WOULD GET BETTER

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:35.534
RETURNS AS A STATE. PRECLUDED

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:37.970
CSU FROM USING ANY GENERAL FUND

02:09:38.036 --> 02:09:40.939
APPROPRIATION MONEY. IN PUTTING

02:09:41.006 --> 02:09:41.907
THAT MONEY INTO THE INVESTMENT

02:09:41.974 --> 02:09:44.676
ACCOUNTS SO THE CSU. USES ARE

02:09:44.743 --> 02:09:46.211
THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:47.279
THAT THEY RECEIVE AND IT'S MY

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:48.981
UNDERSTANDING THEY USE ONE

02:09:49.047 --> 02:09:50.449
TWELFTH EACH MONTH. SO IT'S

02:09:50.516 --> 02:09:52.518
BASICALLY EXHAUSTED BY THE END

02:09:52.584 --> 02:09:54.219
OF THE YEAR SO. MOST OF THE

02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:57.656
REMAINING MONEY. IS TO BE AS

02:09:57.723 --> 02:09:58.290
TUITION AND FEES THAT STUDENTS

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:01.293
PAY SO WE ARE WE ARE CONFIDENT

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.127
THAT THAT MUCH OF THE MONEY IN

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:03.162
THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

02:10:03.228 --> 02:10:05.931
DOLLAR. SURPLUS IS FROM TUITION

02:10:05.998 --> 02:10:07.666
IT CANNOT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR

02:10:07.733 --> 02:10:09.101
IT TO BE FROM GENERAL FUND

02:10:09.168 --> 02:10:10.002
APPROPRIATION THERE CERTAINLY

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:12.471
EARN SOME INTEREST. AND THERE

02:10:12.538 --> 02:10:14.039
ARE SOME SOME PARAMETERS AROUND

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:15.474
WHAT THEY CAN USE THE INTEREST

02:10:15.541 --> 02:10:16.408
EARNED FOR THAT CAN BE USED FOR

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:19.211
CAPITAL OUTLAY. AND THOSE TYPES

02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:20.579
OF PURPOSES BUT FOR GENERAL

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:22.848
OPERATIONS THEY DO HAVE TUITION

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:25.951
MONEY IN THAT SURPLUS ACCOUNT.

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:27.286
IN THE IN THE ONE POINT FIVE

02:10:27.352 --> 02:10:28.086
BILLION WE'RE CONFIDENT OF

02:10:28.153 --> 02:10:29.688
THAT. OKAY SO YOU WERE JUST

02:10:29.755 --> 02:10:31.089
ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE YOU

02:10:31.156 --> 02:10:33.058
CAN'T USE GENERAL FUND RIGHT IN

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:34.293
OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS THIS IS WHAT'S

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:36.461
LEFT OVER THERE FOR. THIS HAD

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:38.697
TO COME FROM TUITION CORRECT.

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:42.701
GOT IT RIGHT. HAVE ADDITIONAL

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:43.268
QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW CENTER

02:10:43.335 --> 02:10:43.835
MONEY AS A QUESTION ON THIS

02:10:43.902 --> 02:10:47.206
ISSUE. WELL THANK YOU MISTER

TEAM FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. IN

02:10:56.014 --> 02:10:57.983
A RE FREEZE I THINK A QUESTION

02:10:58.050 --> 02:10:59.818
THE CHAIR ASKED BUT IN YOUR

02:10:59.885 --> 02:11:03.088
CONCLUSIONS. WAS THERE ANY

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:05.591
FINDING OF A VIOLATION OF LAW

02:11:05.657 --> 02:11:07.826
IN ANY OF YOUR CONCLUSIONS NOW

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:09.494
WE DID NOT FIND ANY VIOLATION

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:11.797
OF LAW AS WE SAID WE FELT THAT

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:13.131
IT AND WE EXPLAIN IN THE REPORT

02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:15.167
THAT THEY DID. MANAGE THE

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:16.635
OUTSIDE ACCOUNTS APPROPRIATELY

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:17.769

SAFEGUARDS IT CETERA SO WE DID

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:21.740
NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF ANY

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:23.675
VIOLATIONS OF ANY LAW. SO LET'S

02:11:23.742 --> 02:11:25.577
TURN NOW TO ACCOUNTING

02:11:25.644 --> 02:11:27.646
PRACTICES IN LOOKING AT THAT

02:11:27.713 --> 02:11:32.050
GRAPHIC OKAY IT LOOKS LIKE YOU

02:11:32.117 --> 02:11:36.388
USE. AS. A BASIS OF COMPARISON

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:39.758
STATE OF CALIFORNIA STANDARDS.

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:42.894
IN RECORD KEEPING. OF ACCOUNTS

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:44.563
THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWED BY SEE

02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:47.499
ISSUE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:49.201
FROM AN ACCOUNTING POINT OF

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:51.637
VIEW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:52.738
TRANSPARENT SEEN YOU'VE SHARED

02:11:52.804 --> 02:11:55.707
THAT. BUT WOULD YOU HAVE A

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:57.676
JUDGMENT AS TO THE ACCOUNTING

02:11:57.743 --> 02:12:00.746
PRACTICES USED OR NOT USED WELL

02:12:00.812 --> 02:12:02.114
WITH RESPECT TO THE RESERVE

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:05.350
POLICY. AS AS MISTER KHALID SO

02:12:05.417 --> 02:12:07.419
SYNDICATED THEY REALLY NEED TO

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:08.687
STRENGTHEN IN HIS WORDS I THINK

02:12:08.754 --> 02:12:09.755
IT'S A GREAT WORD OVERHAUL

02:12:09.821 --> 02:12:11.123
THEIR RESERVE POLICY SO THEIR

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:13.325
ACCOUNTING PRACTICES WITH

02:12:13.392 --> 02:12:16.094
RESPECT TO THEIR RESERVES. NOT

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:17.296
THAT THEY'RE NOT ACCOUNTING FOR

02:12:17.362 --> 02:12:19.398
THE MONEY APPROPRIATELY BUT

02:12:19.464 --> 02:12:20.332
THEY DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:22.501
PARAMETERS AROUND HOW MUCH

02:12:22.567 --> 02:12:24.136
NEEDS TO BE AND THE RESERVE FOR

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:25.570
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHAT'S THE

02:12:25.637 --> 02:12:26.972
MINIMUM AMOUNT WE IF WE AS A

02:12:27.039 --> 02:12:28.273
CAMPUS NEED TO PUT IN THERE

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.775
BECAUSE A LOT OF CAMPUSES. IT

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:31.643
YOU KNOW CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:34.046
THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS HOW

02:12:34.112 --> 02:12:36.515
MUCH MONEY TRIGGERS AND A

02:12:36.581 --> 02:12:38.383
MAXIMUM IF WE HAD A MAXIMUM

02:12:38.450 --> 02:12:39.418
SIMILAR WHAT STATE OF

02:12:39.484 --> 02:12:40.986
CALIFORNIA'S THERE'S A REVENUE

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:43.021
REDUCTION OR TUITION CUT OR

02:12:43.088 --> 02:12:46.124
SOME OTHER CHANGE. SO AS FAR AS

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.926
CHARACTERIZING THEY'RE NOT

02:12:47.993 --> 02:12:49.461
NECESSARILY VIOLATING

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:51.163
ACCOUNTING PRACTICES BUT THEY

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:53.832
DON'T HAVE THE STRONGEST BEST

02:12:53.899 --> 02:12:55.300
PRACTICES IN PLACE THAT WE

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:56.835
BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE LIKE

02:12:56.902 --> 02:12:58.370
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PUT IN

02:12:58.437 --> 02:12:59.604
PLACE WHEN IT CREATED THE RAINY

02:12:59.671 --> 02:13:01.406
DAY FUND. AND THE RESERVE FOR

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:02.774
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY THANK YOU

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:04.176
THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU MISTER

02:13:04.242 --> 02:13:05.544
CHAIR I DO LOOK FORWARD TO

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:07.846
HEARING. FROM THE UNIVERSITY

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:09.147
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO ARE

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:14.219
HERE TODAY I THINK. I THINK WE

02:13:14.286 --> 02:13:14.786
ALL SHARE AN ASPIRATION THAT

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:19.891
THIS WILL LEAD. THE LEGISLATURE

02:13:19.958 --> 02:13:20.425
AND SEE ISSUE TO A BETTER

02:13:20.492 --> 02:13:21.893
UNDERSTANDING. OF HOW THE

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.962
TRANSPARENCY IS TRANSLATE A

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:26.331
BALL TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON WHO

02:13:26.398 --> 02:13:28.467
BENEFIT FROM THE UNIVERSITY

02:13:28.533 --> 02:13:29.701
THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:30.869
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:31.737
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S TRYING

02:13:31.803 --> 02:13:33.638
TO UNDERSTAND IS THE BUDGET AND

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:34.973
WHICH ONES TUITION FUNDS AND

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:38.076
WHETHER TUITION FUNDS WERE USED

02:13:38.143 --> 02:13:41.046
TO CREATE. A SURPLUS AT THE

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:43.648
SAME TIME TUITION WAS GOING UP.

02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:45.684
SO WITH THAT WOULD MOVE TO THE

02:13:45.751 --> 02:13:46.251
A QUESTION BY SOMEONE MEMBER

02:13:46.318 --> 02:13:49.388
BEEN DENIED THAT TO SENATOR PAT.

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:52.557
QUESTION TO A MISS HOUSE HAVING

02:13:52.624 --> 02:13:54.593
SERVED AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER

02:13:54.659 --> 02:13:57.496
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE

02:13:57.562 --> 02:13:59.064
WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT MAINTAINING

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:04.049
THERE ISN'T SPECIFIC PARAMETERS

02:17:04.115 --> 02:17:06.017
THAT CSU AS LAID OUT AS FAR AS

02:17:06.084 --> 02:17:07.452
HOW MUCH SHOULD BE A RESERVE

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:08.920
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY HOW

ESTABLISH THE MAXIMUM OKAY THAT

02:17:23.635 --> 02:17:25.904
SHOULD TRIGGER REDUCTION. SO I

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:27.038
DON'T MEAN TO GO BACK TO HIM

02:17:27.105 --> 02:17:28.740
BUT BUT CENTER PAN THAT'S-

THE LEGISLATURE. AND CERTAINLY

02:17:40.218 --> 02:17:40.986
TO THE STUDENTS SO THAT THERE

02:17:41.052 --> 02:17:44.122
COULD BE A DISCUSSION. WE ARE

GOING TO GENERATE SEVENTY EIGHT

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:46.091
MILLION DOLLARS IF WE RAISE

02:17:46.157 --> 02:17:48.293
TUITION FOLLOW QUESTION SO.

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:51.329
THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO THE

STUDENT GROUP THAT. WHEN THAT

02:17:56.501 --> 02:17:57.035
THAT IT'S BEST WITH THIS WELL

02:17:57.102 --> 02:17:59.170
LET'S WAS A- I WAS IT SUPPOSED

02:17:59.237 --> 02:18:00.205
TO BE THIS CLOSE TO BUT WAS NOT

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:01.172
BROUGHT UP IN A DISCUSSION WHEN

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:02.641
THEY'VE SAID WELL WE A PROPOSED

02:18:02.707 --> 02:18:04.275
TO INCREASE TUITION AND DATE IN

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:04.843
EXPLAINED THAT PART I MEAN

02:18:04.909 --> 02:18:05.777
THERE'S THERE ARE SOMETIMES YOU

02:18:05.844 --> 02:18:07.412
KNOW. TUITIONS ONE OF THE

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:08.446
SOURCES OF REVENUE RIGHT IN THE

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:10.215
HABIT DAYS THIS IS THE ONLY HAS

02:18:10.281 --> 02:18:12.617
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF. SOURCES

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:15.854
REVENUE SOME FROM US IN TUITION.

02:18:15.920 --> 02:18:16.621
MAYBE SOME FROM GRANTS OR OTHER

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:17.722
TYPES OF THINGS AND THEN

02:18:17.789 --> 02:18:20.225
INVESTMENTS RIGHT AND IN THE-

02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:22.427
AND ONE COULD ARGUE THAT.

02:18:22.494 --> 02:18:25.296
DURING GOOD TIMES AND SINCE A

02:18:25.363 --> 02:18:25.864
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THAT'S A

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:28.500
GUESS A- THAT. THAT THAT'S WHEN

02:18:28.566 --> 02:18:30.301
YOU WANT TO BUILD UP. YOUR

02:18:30.368 --> 02:18:32.404
RESERVES ARE SORT OF WHATEVER.

02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:35.173
BUT SAME TIME. IN YOUR REVIEW

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:37.509
OF. BUT THERE'S A TRUSTEE

02:18:37.575 --> 02:18:41.046
MEETINGS ARE. THE DAYS THE US

02:18:41.112 --> 02:18:42.047
THE MAIN STUDENT THAT THE

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:44.049
MINUTES WHATEVER YOU REVIEWED.

02:18:44.115 --> 02:18:45.550
THAT WAS NOT EXPLODE THAT WAS

02:18:45.617 --> 02:18:47.118
NOT THE EXPLICIT REASON AND ONE

02:18:47.185 --> 02:18:49.287
OF THE MAJOR REASONS GIVEN FOR

02:18:49.354 --> 02:18:51.056
INCREASING TUITION THAT WHAT WE

02:18:51.122 --> 02:18:52.123
WANT TO BUILD UP RESERVES AND

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.824
THAT'S WHY WE'RE INCREASING

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:54.893
TUITION. EXACTLY THAT THAT'S

02:18:54.959 --> 02:18:56.194
EXACTLY RIGHT SENATOR SO THAT

02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:58.163
THE REQUIREMENT IS IT'S THE

02:18:58.229 --> 02:18:59.497
WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY

02:18:59.564 --> 02:19:01.032
ACT AND IT SPECIFICALLY

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:04.836
REQUIRES. CSU TO REACH OUT TO

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:06.438
STUDENT GROUPS. IF THEY'RE

02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:07.672
COULDN'T CONTEMPLATING A

02:19:07.739 --> 02:19:09.774
TUITION INCREASE AND WHAT THE

02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:12.744
THEY'RE LANGUAGE REQUIRES IS.

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:13.344
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS HAS TO BE

02:19:13.411 --> 02:19:15.714
ALTERNATIVES TO THAT. SO WE

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.215
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE IN

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:19.684
THAT. REPORT TO THE STUDENTS.

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:22.320
AN OPTION OF WE HAVE A RESERVE

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:24.522
WE COULD USE THAT TO OFFSET ANY

02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:25.990
TUITION THERE IS A DATABASE

02:19:26.057 --> 02:19:27.358
THAT WAS NOT. DISCUSSED THE

02:19:27.425 --> 02:19:29.394
ONLY OPTIONS. LAID OUT IN THE

02:19:29.461 --> 02:19:31.396
REPORT TO THE STUDENTS WAS. WE

02:19:31.463 --> 02:19:32.564
NEED TO GET MORE MONEY FROM THE

02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.966
STATE. OR WE RAISE TUITION IF

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:35.934
WE DON'T WE HAVE TO CUT

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.669
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. THERE

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:43.875
WAS NEVER A DISCUSSION IN. THE

02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:44.409
REPORT THAT I LOOK AT WITH

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:49.948
RESPECT TO THIS. THAT'S TUITION

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:50.482
PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION

02:19:50.548 --> 02:19:51.149
WORKING FAMILIES ACT. THERE WAS

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:51.750
NO DISCUSSION IN THERE ABOUT

02:19:51.816 --> 02:19:54.285
USING ANY TYPE OF RESERVE OKAY

02:19:54.352 --> 02:19:55.453
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR DAYS I MEAN

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:56.054
STE. GIVEN THE FACT THAT MOST

02:19:56.121 --> 02:19:59.524
OF THE MONEY. L. LEE SEEMS LIKE

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.192
HELPED BUILD THE RESERVE DATING

02:20:01.259 --> 02:20:01.793
GO AND SAY IT'S A PAID REASON

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:04.129
WE WANT TO. INCREASED TUITION

02:20:04.195 --> 02:20:07.665
IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO. IMPROVE

02:20:07.732 --> 02:20:08.733
OUR RESERVES WHICH ARE OF THIS

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:10.535
SIZE WE WILL BECOME LARGER IN

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:12.170
CASE WE HAVE FUTURE DOWNTURN

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:13.738
THAT WAS NOT THE MAIN REASON

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:15.607
THAT THERE'S NO DISCUSSION NOT

02:20:15.673 --> 02:20:17.108
I THAT I SAW ON IN THE REPORT

02:20:17.175 --> 02:20:18.576
THAT I REVIEWED AND THE CHAIR

COULD ARGUE WE JUST PICKED UP

02:20:34.759 --> 02:20:36.361
ONE REALLY BAD YEAR WHAT IT

02:20:36.427 --> 02:20:37.729
DIDN'T DO IT I MEAN IS THIS

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:38.863
SOMETHING THAT WE STATUS

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:39.998
BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU LOOK AT

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:42.801
COOLEY TELLS CAN ASSIST BUT

02:20:42.867 --> 02:20:45.403
WHEN PROP THIRTY PASSED THERE

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:47.405
WAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CSU

02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:48.506
THAT THEY WOULD NOT RAISE

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:50.241
TUITION DURING THAT TIME FRAME

02:20:50.308 --> 02:20:52.443
SO DURING A FOUR FIVE YEAR

02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:53.611
WINDOW THERE WERE NO TUITION

02:20:53.678 --> 02:20:56.080
INCREASES BECAUSE PROP THIRTY

02:20:56.147 --> 02:20:57.482
GENERATED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:58.016
OF MONEY FOR THE STATE OF

02:20:58.082 --> 02:20:59.484
CALIFORNIA AND CSU BENEFITTED

02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:01.286
FROM THAT NOW IN THE PRIOR

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:03.021
YEARS I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO

02:21:03.087 --> 02:21:04.489
STAFF. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE

02:21:04.556 --> 02:21:06.224
WORKING FAMILIES TRANSPARENCY

02:21:06.291 --> 02:21:07.492
ACT WAS IN EFFECT IN THE

02:21:07.559 --> 02:21:10.061
EARLIER YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT

02:21:10.128 --> 02:21:12.564
THAT SOME MORE RECENT STATUTES

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:18.536
OKAY BUT. ALSO MAKE NOTE BASED

02:21:18.603 --> 02:21:23.608
ON. ONE OF THE GRASS HERE THAT

02:21:23.675 --> 02:21:25.910
THE RESERVE HAD ACTUALLY SEEM

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:26.477
TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE EVEN

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:28.346
DURING YEARS WHICH I REMEMBER

02:21:28.413 --> 02:21:29.714
WE'RE NOT SO GOOD FOR THE

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.049
LEGISLATURE AND SO WHAT I'LL

02:21:31.115 --> 02:21:33.051
CSU MAY STRUGGLE WE HEARD FROM

02:21:33.117 --> 02:21:33.685
DOCTOR WEBER WAS EXACTLY NUMBER

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:34.886
THE TIME. THAT THEY HAD

02:21:34.953 --> 02:21:36.154
RESERVES THAT THEY CONTINUE TO

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:38.356
INCREASE THEY WEREN'T DIPPING

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:40.692
INTO AT THOSE TIMES IS THAT

02:21:40.758 --> 02:21:42.660
CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT THE

02:21:42.727 --> 02:21:43.862
FIGURE WE HAVE IN THE REPORT

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.597
SHOWS THERE WAS FLAT FOR SOME

02:21:45.663 --> 02:21:47.799
YEARS BUT WE NEVER REALLY SAW.

02:21:47.866 --> 02:21:49.200
A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN THE

02:21:49.267 --> 02:21:51.502
RESERVE SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO

02:21:51.569 --> 02:21:52.804
NECESSARILY USE THOSE RESERVE

02:21:52.871 --> 02:21:55.640
AMOUNTS TO CONTINUE THEIR

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:56.274
OPERATIONS DURING. RECESSIONARY

02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:58.977
TIMES. THANK YOU FOR THAT

02:21:59.043 --> 02:22:00.044
EXPLANATION I UNFORTUNATELY

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:00.979
PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO LEAVE

02:22:01.045 --> 02:22:02.747
BEFORE THE CSU HAS YET TO

02:22:02.814 --> 02:22:03.514
EXPLAIN BUT I'M SURE OTHER

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:06.050
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MIGHT

02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:06.618
WANT TO ASK. THEM TO EXPLAIN

02:22:06.684 --> 02:22:10.622
THAT. PATTERN THANK YOU. THIRTY

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:11.890
CENTER PAN YEAH THAT'S A

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:12.790
QUESTION BELIEVE WE HAVE FOR

02:22:12.857 --> 02:22:14.993
THE CSU AS WELL WHAT IS SENATOR

02:22:15.059 --> 02:22:19.530
ROBB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

02:22:19.597 --> 02:22:20.098
MADAM WATER GOOD TO SEE YOU

02:22:20.164 --> 02:22:21.666
THANK YOU CENTER. YOU KNOW IN

02:22:21.733 --> 02:22:24.469
THE INTERESTS OF OPERATIONS AND

02:22:24.535 --> 02:22:25.036
TRANSPARENCY IT'S CERTAINLY

02:22:25.103 --> 02:22:25.603
IMPORTANT I THINK AND YOU'VE

02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:27.739
NOTED. THE ONE INSTITUTION SETS

02:22:27.805 --> 02:22:31.075
UP A RESERVE ACCOUNT THAT THERE

02:22:31.142 --> 02:22:32.577
BE A PLAN FOR. HOW AND WHEN TO

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:34.612
USE IT I'M NOT. SURE IN MY

02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:36.547
RECOLLECTION THAT OUR STATE

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.149
SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:39.384
UNCERTAINTY IS SUPPOSED TO THE

02:22:39.450 --> 02:22:43.021
RAINY DAY FUND. HAS A LOT OF

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:44.155
DETAIL AS TO WHEN THAT USED A

02:22:44.222 --> 02:22:46.124
EXCEPT AS TO. WHEN THE

02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:47.592
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE

02:22:47.659 --> 02:22:49.861
GOVERNOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH

02:22:49.928 --> 02:22:50.828
THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSED TO USE

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:53.765
IT AM I CORRECT. RIGHT SO THAT

02:22:53.831 --> 02:22:55.233
THE SEPARATE ONE THESE ARE FOR

02:22:55.300 --> 02:22:56.267
THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ON

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:59.003
BASICALLY THAT'S- DISCRETIONARY

02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:00.204
SERVE MAYBE WE SHOULD SET UP

02:23:00.271 --> 02:23:01.906
SOME RULES FOR THAT TOO RIGHT

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:03.007
AND WHAT THAT ONE DOES THE

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:05.743
DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE IS THAT

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.712
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THIS IS

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:08.579
THE NOT THIS IN A RAINY DAY

02:23:08.646 --> 02:23:09.447
FUND THIS THEM OUT THIS

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:11.649
INFRASTRUCTURE FINDS YOU COULD

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:12.250
KIND OF DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:13.551
THE TWO. WE DO LOOK AT THAT BUT

02:23:13.618 --> 02:23:16.854
PUTTING THAT ASIDE. ASSUMING AN

02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:21.359
APPROPRIATE. RESERVE PLAN IS IN

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:25.596
PLACE OR PROPER ONE. META

02:23:25.663 --> 02:23:26.664
MONITOR BASED ON YOUR

02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:27.131
EXPERIENCE AND IT IS

02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:28.232
SIGNIFICANT. WHAT LEVEL OF

02:23:28.299 --> 02:23:28.833
RESERVE WOULD YOU EXPECT TO

02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:30.034
FIND AND SEE ISSUE IS AN

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:33.271
INSTITUTION. TALKING ABOUT TWO

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:33.905
THINGS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:35.606
PROCESS AND TRANSPARENCY BUT

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:36.808
THE MORE INFLAMMATORY PIECE OF

02:23:36.874 --> 02:23:37.442
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE

02:23:37.508 --> 02:23:41.079
SIZE. OF THE CORPUS HERE THE

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:43.548
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. OF THAT

02:23:43.614 --> 02:23:45.116
WE ALL SEEM TO BE FOCUSED ON

02:23:45.183 --> 02:23:47.485
SOME HIS MOTIVATION CLEAR YOUR

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:48.886
QUESTION IS CLEAR IT'S AT AS

02:23:48.953 --> 02:23:50.321
ALWAYS A DIFFICULT QUESTION

02:23:50.388 --> 02:23:52.623
BECAUSE THE RESERVE POLICY THAT

02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:54.459
THE CSU NEEDS TO DO SOME

02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:55.727
ANALYSIS SOME HISTORICAL

02:23:55.793 --> 02:23:57.495
ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE. WHAT

02:23:57.562 --> 02:23:58.296
HAPPENED DURING THOSE

02:23:58.363 --> 02:23:59.864
RECESSIONARY TIMES WE RAISE

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:01.232
TUITION IF WE WANT TO AVOID

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:02.600
DOING THAT IN THE FUTURE IF WE

02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:04.102
HAVE A RECESSION HOW MUCH MONEY

02:24:04.168 --> 02:24:05.703
DO WE HAVE TO HAVE IN RESERVE

02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:07.605
SO IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO

02:24:07.672 --> 02:24:09.807
DEPEND UPON THE PARAMETERS. AND

02:24:09.874 --> 02:24:10.875
THE INFORMATION THAT THE CSU

02:24:10.942 --> 02:24:13.678
WANTS TO USE TO DETERMINE HOW

02:24:13.745 --> 02:24:15.146
MUCH MONEY THEY NEED TO PUT IN

02:24:15.213 --> 02:24:16.214
THE RESERVE AND OF COURSE YOU

02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:17.382
WANT TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT

02:24:17.448 --> 02:24:18.850
OF MONEY IN RESERVE. AND THEY

02:24:18.916 --> 02:24:20.718
TALK ABOUT 10% FOR CAPITAL

02:24:20.785 --> 02:24:22.420
OUTLAY FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

02:24:22.487 --> 02:24:23.488
IN THE FUTURE SO THERE'S A

02:24:23.554 --> 02:24:25.056
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO

02:24:25.123 --> 02:24:26.924
CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE

02:24:26.991 --> 02:24:29.193
ESTABLISHING A RESERVE POLICY

02:24:29.260 --> 02:24:30.928
AND CERTAIN RESERVE AMOUNTS.

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.163
DEPENDING UPON WHAT YOU'RE

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:33.731
GONNA USE THAT RESERVE FOR IF

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.767
YOU HAD IF IN FACT SEE ISSUE

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:38.202
HAD PUT IN PLACE AN APPROPRIATE

02:24:38.269 --> 02:24:41.406
RESERVE POLICY WITH. CRITERIA

02:24:41.472 --> 02:24:41.839
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T%

02:24:41.906 --> 02:24:43.775
NECESSARILY DO THAT AND BOTH OF

02:24:43.841 --> 02:24:44.609
A AND R. RESERVE ACCOUNTS HERE

02:24:44.675 --> 02:24:46.878
ALL OF THEM HERE AT THE STATE.

02:24:46.944 --> 02:24:48.079
WOULD YOU HAVE FOUND THE ONE

02:24:48.146 --> 02:24:49.013
POINT FIVE BILLION TO BE

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.749
UNREASONABLE AS A RESERVE FOR

02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:57.422
INSTITUTION. OF LIKE SEE ISSUE.

02:24:57.488 --> 02:24:58.056
AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT QUESTION

02:24:58.122 --> 02:24:58.689
TO ANSWER I WOULD WANT TO KNOW

02:24:58.756 --> 02:24:59.257
IF THEY HAD AN APPROPRIATE

02:24:59.323 --> 02:25:00.491
POLICY AND THEY HAD LAID OUT

02:25:00.558 --> 02:25:02.460
EXACTLY HOW THEY WERE INTENDING

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:03.995
TO USE. THE ONE POINT FIVE

02:25:04.062 --> 02:25:05.596
BILLION DOLLARS AND WHAT THE

02:25:05.663 --> 02:25:07.131
VARIOUS AMOUNTS WERE SET ASIDE

02:25:07.198 --> 02:25:09.200
FOR. THEN WE WOULD HAVE DONE A

02:25:09.267 --> 02:25:10.968
DIFFERENT TYPE OF ANALYSIS. BUT

02:25:11.035 --> 02:25:12.303
THE MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT'S

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:13.304
AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT THE

02:25:13.371 --> 02:25:14.739
EQUALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MY

02:25:14.806 --> 02:25:16.908
MIND IS THE DISCLOSURE OF THE-

02:25:16.974 --> 02:25:18.843
OF THE SURPLUS A RESERVE

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:21.079
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO REFER TO

02:25:21.145 --> 02:25:23.047
IT AS- BUT- BUT- WE WEREN'T

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:24.549
ABLE TO DO THAT TYPE OF

02:25:24.615 --> 02:25:25.850
ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

02:25:25.917 --> 02:25:28.319
TELL US. THEY THEY ESSENTIALLY

02:25:28.386 --> 02:25:29.554
HAD TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.022
SAID WE'RE GONNA SET ASIDE FOUR

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:31.856
HUNDRED MILLION FOR RESERVE FOR

02:25:31.923 --> 02:25:33.858
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. AND THEN

02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:34.692
WE'VE GOT THE OTHER ONE POINT

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:35.760
FIVE BILLION AND BASICALLY

02:25:35.827 --> 02:25:38.529
SAYING. WELL IF YOU RUN INTO

02:25:38.596 --> 02:25:39.464
DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES WE'RE

02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:41.299
GONNA NEED TO DIP INTO THAT.

02:25:41.365 --> 02:25:43.768
WITHOUT REALLY EXPLAINING OKAY

02:25:43.835 --> 02:25:46.104
HOW MUCH. WOULD YOU NEED TO

02:25:46.170 --> 02:25:47.004
DEPEND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT

02:25:47.071 --> 02:25:48.473
PARAMETERS IS THE STATE OF

02:25:48.539 --> 02:25:49.774
CALIFORNIA EVER GOING TO CUT

02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:53.010
OFF FUNDING FOR THE CSU SYSTEM.

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:53.978
THE REALITY OF THAT IS PROBABLY

02:25:54.045 --> 02:25:55.980
QUITE SLIM I WOULD HOPE. SO

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:57.415
THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

02:25:57.482 --> 02:25:58.716
THINGS THAT NEED TO GO INTO THE

02:25:58.783 --> 02:26:01.352
THOUGHT PROCESS. IN DEVELOPING

02:26:01.419 --> 02:26:02.954
A RESERVE POLICY IN

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:03.554
ESTABLISHING WHAT THAT RESERVE

02:26:03.621 --> 02:26:06.791
AMOUNT SHOULD BE. AND I DON'T

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:08.759
MEAN I DON'T DISAGREE IN TERMS

02:26:08.826 --> 02:26:10.328
OF. PROCESS I'M JUST TRYING IS

02:26:10.394 --> 02:26:12.263
A BUDGET TEARS BECAUSE I DO

02:26:12.330 --> 02:26:14.365
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS

02:26:14.432 --> 02:26:15.366
SO. EVERY YEAR I'M JUST TRYING

02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:18.236
TO. GET SOME INFORMATION SO

02:26:18.302 --> 02:26:19.370
THAT NEXT YEAR WHEN WE START

02:26:19.437 --> 02:26:21.038
THE BUDGET PROCESS AGAIN I CAN

02:26:21.105 --> 02:26:22.940
EVALUATE RESERVE ACCOUNTS VIS A

02:26:23.007 --> 02:26:24.909
VIS. OF THE SEA ISSUE BUDGET

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:26.811
REQUEST DO YOU DO YOU DO EITHER

02:26:26.878 --> 02:26:29.080
OF YOU RECALL WHAT PERCENTAGE.

02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:30.214
THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:31.282
REPRESENTS OF THE TOTAL SEE

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:35.753
ISSUE OPERATING BUDGET. I

02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.088
RECALL THE WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:39.824
IT'S YOU KNOW MAYBE 1015% OF

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:41.792
THE CSU COULD PROBABLY PROVIDE

02:26:41.859 --> 02:26:42.727
SOMETHING MORE ACCURATE

02:26:42.793 --> 02:26:44.562
INFORMATION. BUT BASICALLY

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:45.863
THOUGH IT I'M TO YOUR QUESTION

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.598
IN TERMS OF AS A SOMEONE THIS

02:26:47.665 --> 02:26:49.300
REVIEW IN THE BUDGET. I THINK

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:51.135
THERE'S A BALANCE THAT I THINK

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:53.371
STAKEHOLDERS ONE OF STRIKE ON

02:26:53.437 --> 02:26:54.305
THE ONE HAND YOU WANT TO BUILD

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:55.773
A PRUDENT RESERVE FOR THAT YOU

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.074
KNOW PROTECTS AGAINST ECONOMIC

02:26:57.141 --> 02:26:58.943
BAD ECONOMIC TIMES. BUT THE

02:26:59.010 --> 02:26:59.477
FACT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:26:59.544 --> 02:27:00.645
TUITION THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

02:27:00.711 --> 02:27:02.180
COIN IS HOW DO YOU ALSO BOUNCE

02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:03.314
THAT WITH AFFORDABILITY AND

02:27:03.381 --> 02:27:04.315
MAKING SURE THAT THIS MONEY

02:27:04.382 --> 02:27:07.084
SPORTS THE BEST USE. SO THAT

02:27:07.151 --> 02:27:07.985
THE REASON WHY DISCLOSURE

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:09.654
SUPPORT INTO IS THAT WE IS

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:10.988
SUPPORTED THAT YOU SPECIFIC

02:27:11.055 --> 02:27:12.056
IDENTIFIED THIS IS THEM OUT

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:13.324
THIS MONEY BY TUITION IS THE

02:27:13.391 --> 02:27:15.760
MOST SURPLUS. THAT IS THAT WERE

02:27:15.826 --> 02:27:18.596
USING TUITION TO MAINTAIN AND

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:20.164
THAT WAY STAKEHOLDER STUDENTS

02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:22.333
THE LEGISLATURE COULD DISCUSS.

02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:24.135
OKAY WELL WHAT'S THE RIGHT

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:27.238
AMOUNT IS THIS THE RIGHT NOT

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:28.239
FOR A RESERVE OR HEY YOU KNOW

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:29.440
DO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:30.241
TUITION RATES REMAIN AFFORDABLE

02:27:30.308 --> 02:27:31.008
SO WHAT IF I'M UNDERSTANDING

02:27:31.075 --> 02:27:34.212
THAT THE PRESENTATION.

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:34.812
CORRECTLY THE ONLY REASON THAT

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:39.617
THIS. THIS PART OF MONEY

02:27:39.684 --> 02:27:40.551
CONSISTS OF TUITION DOLLARS OR

02:27:40.618 --> 02:27:41.586
THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE PUT

02:27:41.652 --> 02:27:43.154
ON. THE SEA ISSUE AND THE WAY

02:27:43.221 --> 02:27:43.754
THE C. ISSUE SPENDS ITS MONEY

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:44.555
THROUGH THE YEARS THAT CORRECT.

02:27:44.622 --> 02:27:46.290
RIGHT IF WE HAD NOT PUT THOSE

02:27:46.357 --> 02:27:48.693
RESTRICTIONS ON THE SEA ISSUE.

02:27:48.759 --> 02:27:50.595
TERMS OF DRAW DOWN BY MONTHS IN

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:52.964
WHICH FUNDS ARE USED WHEN. THIS

02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:55.933
POT OF MONEY WOULD BE A MIXTURE

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:56.467
OF TUITION IN GENERAL FUND

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:59.270
MONEY CORRECT. A RIGHT

02:27:59.337 --> 02:28:00.137
POTENTIALLY HONEST UC'S

02:28:00.204 --> 02:28:02.206
PRACTICE IT IS THOUGH TO SPEND

02:28:02.273 --> 02:28:04.041
AT THE GENERAL FUND FINDS ON IS

02:28:04.108 --> 02:28:06.277
FIXED COSTS LIKE IT'S PAYROLL.

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:08.813
WE REQUIRE THAT DILLON. I DON'T

02:28:08.879 --> 02:28:10.248
KNOW WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS BUT

02:28:10.314 --> 02:28:10.815
THAT'S BASICALLY GOT A CABLE

02:28:10.881 --> 02:28:12.416
THREAT AND MOUNTED THEN

02:28:12.483 --> 02:28:14.151
JENNIFER COVERS UP TO A CERTAIN

02:28:14.218 --> 02:28:16.420
POINT. AND THEN DOES BASICALLY

02:28:16.487 --> 02:28:17.655
PAID FOR AND THEN THE REST IS

02:28:17.722 --> 02:28:19.423
COVERED BY. OKAY THANK YOU I

02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:20.925
DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS I

02:28:20.992 --> 02:28:22.293
CERTAINLY AGREE WE NEED SOME

02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:23.594
PROCESS IMPROVEMENT HERE BUT-

02:28:23.661 --> 02:28:25.930
WE MAY FIND IT SEE ISSUE AGREES

02:28:25.997 --> 02:28:28.633
TO. YES SIR SEC HELLO. SENATE

02:28:28.699 --> 02:28:31.702
ROTH YET A QUESTION ABOUT THE

02:28:31.769 --> 02:28:32.637
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHAT IS

02:28:32.703 --> 02:28:35.039
IT REPRESENTS THE ONE POINT

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:37.041
FIVE BILLION WAS AS OF TWO

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:37.608
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:28:37.675 --> 02:28:39.443
AND- I BELIEVE THERE ABOUT SIX

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:41.045
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.947
EXPENDITURES OPERATING EXPENSES

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:45.549
THAT YEAR FOR CSU. SO THE ONE

02:28:45.616 --> 02:28:46.784
POINT FIVE BILLION REPRESENTS

02:28:46.851 --> 02:28:49.954
ABOUT 20% OF OPERATING EXPENSES

02:28:50.021 --> 02:28:52.256

02:30:32.556 --> 02:30:34.625
DETAIL. SO WITHOUT AN AUDIT IN

02:30:34.692 --> 02:30:36.861

THAT INFORMATION. AND

02:30:58.649 --> 02:31:00.384
ESSENTIALLY BREAK IT DOWN FOR

02:31:00.451 --> 02:31:01.252

CLEAR THIS IS NOT ILLEGAL BUT

02:31:30.648 --> 02:31:31.715
IT SURE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD IF

02:31:31.782 --> 02:31:33.884
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. AND

02:31:33.951 --> 02:31:34.785

UC DOLLARS BUT THIS BY

02:31:40.057 --> 02:31:41.959
COMPARISON LOOKS LIKE THE UC

02:31:42.026 --> 02:31:43.294
PROBLEM ON STEROIDS AND A LOT

02:31:43.360 --> 02:31:45.696
OF DIFFERENT WAYS. COULD WE

02:31:45.763 --> 02:31:48.466

NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

02:32:03.914 --> 02:32:05.816
BARGAINING UNITS BUT I WONDER

02:32:05.883 --> 02:32:08.285
IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO COMMENT ON

02:32:08.352 --> 02:32:08.853
SOME OF THE EFFORTS IN THE

02:32:08.919 --> 02:32:10.254
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WHEN WE

02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:12.156
WERE ON ADVOCATING FOR MORE

02:32:12.223 --> 02:32:15.793
DOLLARS FOR THE CSU SYSTEM THE

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:16.961
ASSUMPTION WAS THAT IF WE

02:32:17.027 --> 02:32:18.128
DIDN'T FIGHT HARD FOR MORE

02:32:18.195 --> 02:32:20.431
DOLLARS THE UC SYSTEM THAT THE

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:22.566
SKY WOULD FALL. AND IN FACT

02:32:22.633 --> 02:32:24.502
MANY OF MANY OF US HERE PUT ON

02:32:24.568 --> 02:32:27.238
SOCKS AND ADVOCATED AND WE WERE

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:28.172
ALL ABOUT MAKING SURE THE UC

REALLY. REALLY BELIEVE IN THE

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:37.047
SYSTEM. BUT TAKE A LOOK BACK

02:32:37.114 --> 02:32:39.149
NOW AND HAVING YOU FIND ONE

02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:41.352
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. ONE

02:32:41.418 --> 02:32:42.786
OF THE COMMENT YOU CAN MAKE

02:32:42.853 --> 02:32:44.588
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

02:32:44.655 --> 02:32:46.390
ALMOST THE DIPPING OF THE

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:47.925
LEGISLATURE THAT MAKE US FIGHT

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:48.526
FOR ALL THESE DOLLARS. OF ONE

02:32:48.592 --> 02:32:51.061
NOT NOT. NOT NECESSARILY

02:32:51.128 --> 02:32:53.330
KNOWING THAT THERE'S- A BILLION

02:32:53.397 --> 02:32:55.266
DOLLARS OR SO AT THE TIME. IN

02:32:55.332 --> 02:32:57.368

SHOULD HAVE RESERVE RAINY DAY.

02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:00.104
THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION FOR

02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:03.374
THIS. BUT CERTAINLY WE SHOULD

02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:04.675
AT LEAST HAVE SOME SORT OF

02:33:04.742 --> 02:33:06.610
GENERAL UNDERSTANDING WHEN

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:07.778
WE'RE GOING INTO THIS NO WONDER

02:33:07.845 --> 02:33:08.712
IF YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME COMMENTS

02:33:08.779 --> 02:33:10.381
ABOUT THAT THAT INTERACTION

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:11.982
WELL CERTAINLY ASSEMBLY MORE

02:33:12.049 --> 02:33:13.317
SANTIAGO THAT THAT'S THE

02:33:13.384 --> 02:33:15.085
CONCERN WE HAD AND THAT'S WHY

02:33:15.152 --> 02:33:17.187
WE FOCUSED QUITE A BIT ON AND

02:33:17.254 --> 02:33:19.356
MY COMMENTS TODAY FOCUS ON

02:33:19.423 --> 02:33:22.526
TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE IT'S AS I

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:23.594
SAID WE'RE WE'RE NOT

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:25.029
NECESSARILY ARGUING THAT THE

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:26.397
CSU SHOULD NOT HAVE A PRUDENT

02:33:26.463 --> 02:33:28.866
RESERVE BUT THEY SHOULD FULLY

02:33:28.933 --> 02:33:31.101
DISCLOSE WHAT THEIR PLANS ARE

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:32.736
THEY SHOULD HAVE VERY SPECIFIC

02:33:32.803 --> 02:33:35.372
PLANS A STRONG POLICY BUT THEN

02:33:35.439 --> 02:33:36.607
THEY SHOULD DISCLOSE THAT TO

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:39.310
THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE IN

02:33:39.376 --> 02:33:40.945
THAT ACADEMIC SUSTAINABILITY

02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:41.912
PLAN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE

02:33:41.979 --> 02:33:44.615
SENDS A LETTER TO THE C. ISSUE

02:33:44.682 --> 02:33:45.849
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND

02:33:45.916 --> 02:33:47.318
SAYS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND ALL

02:33:47.384 --> 02:33:50.554
AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO THE CSU

02:33:50.621 --> 02:33:52.656
AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE

02:33:52.723 --> 02:33:53.757
DISCUSSING TODAY WAS NOT

02:33:53.824 --> 02:33:56.327
INCLUDED IN THE MATERIALS THAT

02:33:56.393 --> 02:33:57.294
WERE PROVIDED TO THE

02:33:57.361 --> 02:33:59.964
LEGISLATURE SO THAT'S A CONCERN

02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:01.265
THAT WE RAISE IN THE AUDIT

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:02.333
REPORT AND THE CONCERN WE

02:34:02.399 --> 02:34:04.068
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AGAIN IT'S

02:34:04.134 --> 02:34:06.003
FULL TRANSPARENCY SO THAT THE

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:08.038
DISCUSSION CAN HAPPEN THE

02:34:08.105 --> 02:34:10.541
DISCUSSION CAN BE WE NEED TO

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:13.978
HAVE A RESERVE WE BELIEVE WE

02:34:14.044 --> 02:34:14.545
NEED X. AMOUNT BASED ON THE

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:15.446
ANALYSIS WE'VE DONE IN THE

02:34:15.512 --> 02:34:18.582
PAST. WE'VE GOT TO IF YOU AGREE

02:34:18.649 --> 02:34:22.086
LEGISLATURE WITH THAT. NOTION

02:34:22.152 --> 02:34:23.153
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE X. AMOUNT

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:23.754
IN RESERVE THEN WE STILL NEED

02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:25.189
AND IN ADDITION AN INCREASE IN

02:34:25.255 --> 02:34:25.756
THE APPROPRIATION FROM THE

02:34:25.823 --> 02:34:27.124
STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR- THERE'S

02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:29.393
A DECISION THAT THE-APPROPRIATION DOES NOT NEED TO

02:34:29.460 --> 02:34:30.928
INCREASE. BUT THE CONVERSATION

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:33.130
CAN'T HAPPEN IF THE LEGISLATURE

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:35.633
WAS IN GIVEN ALL OF THE

02:34:35.699 --> 02:34:36.200
INFORMATION. AND THROUGH THE

02:34:36.266 --> 02:34:38.702
TERMINATE FOLLOW UP ON THAT.

02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:39.470
THANK YOU. AND IF YOU DON'T

02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:40.771
EVEN IN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

02:34:40.838 --> 02:34:43.874
LEGISLATION BEFORE US. AT LEAST

02:34:43.941 --> 02:34:44.475
I WAS LED TO BELIEVE WHEN WE

02:34:44.541 --> 02:34:47.011
TALKED ABOUT A STEP INCREASES.

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:48.479
FROM MY COLLEAGUE IN SAN DIEGO

02:34:48.545 --> 02:34:50.180
WHAT WHEN SHE BROUGHT THAT UP I

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:50.848
WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS

02:34:50.914 --> 02:34:52.683
A QUESTION OF AFFORDABILITY.

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:53.550
AND IF IT'S A QUESTION OF

02:34:53.617 --> 02:34:54.752
AFFORDABILITY I HAVE A HARD

02:34:54.818 --> 02:34:56.186
TIME RECONCILING I REALIZE YOU

02:34:56.253 --> 02:34:58.455
BUT THIS IS MY- MY FRUSTRATION.

02:34:58.522 --> 02:35:00.491
I HAVE A HARD TIME RECONCILING

02:35:00.557 --> 02:35:01.258
THAT WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE

02:35:01.325 --> 02:35:02.426
BILLION AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE

02:35:02.493 --> 02:35:04.194

02:35:04.261 --> 02:35:05.462
QUESTIONABLE FOR ABILITY WHEN

02:35:05.529 --> 02:35:11.335
IT COMES TO. STEP INCREASES. NO

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:11.935
WONDER IF THERE'S ANY COMMENT

02:35:12.002 --> 02:35:13.203
ON THAT BECAUSE I. ON DIG IN A

02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.837
LITTLE BIT HERE BECAUSE I FEEL

02:35:13.904 --> 02:35:15.539
LIKE. LIKE LIKE MAYBE MAYBE

02:35:15.606 --> 02:35:16.073
WASN'T FORTHCOMING TO THE

LEGISLATURE AS WELL. I

02:35:17.841 --> 02:35:19.076
UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION I

02:35:19.143 --> 02:35:21.011
CAN'T COMMENT ON DISCUSSIONS

02:35:21.078 --> 02:35:23.547

BEST PRACTICES THAT WE BELIEVE

02:37:51.562 --> 02:37:53.797
THE CSU SHOULD EMBRACE AND

02:37:53.864 --> 02:37:56.433
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:58.001

AUDITOR'S OFFICE IN AND AGAIN

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:31.835
MR WHITE THE CHANCELLOR IS

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:32.936
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE C. ISSUE

02:38:33.003 --> 02:38:33.937

02:38:36.473 --> 02:38:37.007
AS THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR ME.

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:40.310

BUDGET FOLKS AS FAR AS SHARING

02:39:01.431 --> 02:39:01.798

LEGISLATURE THAT CERTAINLY

02:39:03.066 --> 02:39:09.239
COMES FROM. ONTO HIM TO SHARE

02:39:09.306 --> 02:39:13.277
ANY FURTHER. I CANNOT BELIEVE

02:39:13.343 --> 02:39:15.379
ESTHER'S STAND HOUSING MIGHT

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:17.748
HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS RIGHT.

02:39:17.814 --> 02:39:20.183
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT CAMPUSES

02:39:20.250 --> 02:39:21.752
BUILDER RESERVES BY

02:39:21.818 --> 02:39:23.020
SPECIFICALLY BUDGETING A

02:39:23.086 --> 02:39:26.390
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SPENDING FOR

02:39:26.456 --> 02:39:28.358
RESERVES SO THEY'LL BUDGET

02:39:28.425 --> 02:39:31.528
MONEY FOR SALARIES FOR BENEFITS

02:39:31.595 --> 02:39:33.764
FOR TRAVEL AND OPERATIONS. AS

02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:35.198

WELL AS FOR RESERVES IN MAINE

02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:40.003
IN MANY CASES SO TO ANSWER YOUR

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:42.639
QUESTION. TO THE X. THERE'S TWO

02:39:42.706 --> 02:39:43.640
WEEKS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

02:39:43.707 --> 02:39:45.442
COST IN A WAY IF THE CAMPUS IS

02:39:45.509 --> 02:39:47.110
BUDGETING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

02:39:47.177 --> 02:39:49.012
MONEY SAY MILLION DOLLARS TWO

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:49.579
MILLION DOLLARS IN A CERTAIN

02:39:49.646 --> 02:39:52.582
YEAR. TWO RESERVES FOR WHATEVER

02:39:52.649 --> 02:39:53.717
PURPOSE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY

02:39:53.784 --> 02:39:57.421
CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT'S A

02:39:57.487 --> 02:39:58.822
THAT'S COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF

02:39:58.889 --> 02:40:00.190
SOMETHING ELSE THAT COULD BE

02:40:00.257 --> 02:40:01.658
FUNDED INSTEAD AND SO RIGHT

02:40:01.725 --> 02:40:06.496
NOW. IT'S NOT. CLEAR. WHICH

02:40:06.563 --> 02:40:09.967
CAMPUSES ARE BUDGETING WHAT

02:40:10.033 --> 02:40:12.736
AMOUNTS IT'S BECOMING CLEAR

02:40:12.803 --> 02:40:15.405
WITH THE PORTAL THAT MENTIONED

02:40:15.472 --> 02:40:18.241
EARLIER OF THE TRANSPARENCY

02:40:18.308 --> 02:40:22.412
PORTAL THAT JUST WENT LIVE IN

02:40:22.479 --> 02:40:24.748
MAY THERE'S SOME GOOD DAY OUR

02:40:24.815 --> 02:40:27.851
DATA THERE IT IS QUITE HARD TO

02:40:27.918 --> 02:40:29.386
NAVIGATE RIGHT NOW I PERSONALLY

02:40:29.453 --> 02:40:31.655
HAVE SPENT SOME TIME ON IT AND

02:40:31.722 --> 02:40:34.291
NEEDED QUITE A TUTORIAL. SO

02:49:21.050 --> 02:49:22.852
THAT MONIES ENCUMBERED. IS THAT

02:49:22.919 --> 02:49:26.789
CORRECT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR-

02:49:26.856 --> 02:49:29.225
ALMOST EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:29.826

02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:35.765
ABOUT MONEY THAT'S ENCUMBERED

UNQUOTE RESERVE CONTEXT. THEY

02:49:40.103 --> 02:49:41.604
THEY ARE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND

02:49:41.671 --> 02:49:42.438
IF WE LOOK AT THAT FROM OUR

02:49:42.505 --> 02:49:43.273
STATE POINT OF VIEW WE WOULD

02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:45.742

FOR OTHER MONEY IN RESERVE

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:51.014
THAT'S ALSO STORE SPECIAL FAR I

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:54.484

02:49:54.551 --> 02:49:58.021
LOT OF THAT SPECIAL FUNDS.

02:49:58.087 --> 02:49:58.888
BECAUSE IT COMES WITH DIFFERENT

02:49:58.955 --> 02:50:00.690
SOURCE COAST STATES ALREADY

02:50:00.757 --> 02:50:01.291
SPECIFIED AS TO WHERE THAT IS

02:50:01.357 --> 02:50:02.559
APPROPRIATE. SO I THINK I DO

02:50:02.625 --> 02:50:03.092
WANT TO BE. CAREFUL JUST

02:50:03.159 --> 02:50:06.162
UNDERSTAND. THE LANGUAGE IS

02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:09.732
BEING USED BECAUSE IN OUR

02:50:09.799 --> 02:50:10.199
LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT IS

02:50:10.266 --> 02:50:12.835
DIFFERENT IS NOT. RIGHT MISTER

02:50:12.902 --> 02:50:14.337
CHANG AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE

02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:16.306

02:50:16.372 --> 02:50:17.340

02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:22.812
THAT IS SIMILAR TO SB ONE MONEY

02:50:22.879 --> 02:50:25.481
IT'S SPECIFICALLY. FOR IT IT'S

02:50:25.548 --> 02:50:26.916
RESTRICTED FOR A SPECIFIC

02:50:26.983 --> 02:50:28.351
PURPOSE YOU CAN'T USE THAT FOR

03:01:41.657 --> 03:01:42.191
COUNTRY THEY SERVE SPECIFIC AN

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:44.860
ESSENTIAL PURPOSES FURTHER THAN

03:01:44.927 --> 03:01:46.228
SENSATIONALIZE LANGUAGE

03:01:46.295 --> 03:01:46.929
THROUGHOUT THE REPORT BEST

03:01:46.996 --> 03:01:48.964
EXAMPLE FIGHT IN ITS TITLE WE

03:01:49.031 --> 03:01:50.866
SEIZE UPON BY THE MEDIA THESE

03:01:50.933 --> 03:01:52.468
ARE NOT DISCRETIONARY SURPLUSES

03:01:52.534 --> 03:01:54.336
THESE ARE IMPORTANT REQUIRED

03:01:54.403 --> 03:01:56.071
RESERVES THAT WE NEED TO

03:01:56.138 --> 03:01:56.538
MAINTAIN THE PHYSICAL

03:01:56.605 --> 03:02:01.877
INTEGRITY. OF OUR SYSTEM. MANY

03:02:01.944 --> 03:02:03.178
MANY OF THE MEDIA REPORTS

03:02:03.245 --> 03:02:05.314
REFERRED TO US AS HAVING HIDDEN

03:02:05.381 --> 03:02:06.715
THE BALL WITH RESPECT TO THESE

03:02:06.782 --> 03:02:08.884
RESERVES IS RESERVE RESERVES

EVERY ANNUAL AUDITED STATEMENT.

AND THEY'VE BEEN DISCUSS WITH

03:02:12.621 --> 03:02:15.190
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. AS A

03:02:15.257 --> 03:02:16.525
MEMBER OF THE BOARD CAREFULLY

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:17.993
REVIEWED ALL THE INFORMATION

03:02:18.060 --> 03:02:18.627
DOCUMENTATION AND PRESENTATIONS

03:02:18.694 --> 03:02:22.064
REGARDING RESERVES. IS MY FIRM

03:02:22.131 --> 03:02:22.931
BELIEF THAT THE CSU HAS BEEN

03:02:22.998 --> 03:02:24.433
NOTHING SHORT OF FULLY

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:25.034
TRANSPARENT AND OPEN ABOUT ITS

03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:27.936
RESERVE POLICY. IN APPRECIATIVE

03:02:28.003 --> 03:02:29.705
OF THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO

03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:30.572
CONFIRM THIS FOR ALL THE

03:02:30.639 --> 03:02:32.474
UNIVERSITIES STAKEHOLDERS. AND

03:02:32.541 --> 03:02:33.575
I JUST WANNA SAY A COUPLE

03:02:33.642 --> 03:02:35.277
THINGS WE TALK A LOT ABOUT

03:02:35.344 --> 03:02:36.478
TUITION INCREASES AND IT SOUNDS

03:02:36.545 --> 03:02:38.113
LIKE WE THE TRUSTEES HAVE BEEN

03:02:38.180 --> 03:02:39.281
INCREASING TUITION ON A REGULAR

03:02:39.348 --> 03:02:41.650
BASIS. THERE'S BEEN ONE TUITION

03:02:41.717 --> 03:02:42.184
INCREASE IN THE PAST EIGHT

03:02:42.251 --> 03:02:45.220
YEARS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:02:45.287 --> 03:02:46.455
RESERVES FROM THE STATE OF

03:02:46.522 --> 03:02:48.490
CALIFORNIA PERSPECTIVE AND YOU

03:02:48.557 --> 03:02:50.092
LOOK AT THE RAINY DAY PART OF

03:02:50.159 --> 03:02:52.127
THOSE RESERVES. THAT IS FOUR

03:02:52.194 --> 03:02:53.028
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

03:02:53.095 --> 03:02:53.629
THREE WEEKS WORTH OF OPERATING

03:02:53.696 --> 03:02:56.965
REVENUE. MOST PEOPLE WOULD TELL

03:02:57.032 --> 03:02:58.701
YOU RATING AGENCIES AND OTHER

03:02:58.767 --> 03:03:00.502
FISCAL EXPERTS THAT THAT'S NOT

03:03:00.569 --> 03:03:01.437
ENOUGH. WE SHOULD HAVE A LARGER

03:03:01.503 --> 03:03:05.374
EMERGENCY RESERVE. I SHOULD

03:03:05.441 --> 03:03:05.941
ALSO NOTE THAT MY SENTIMENTS

03:03:06.008 --> 03:03:06.442
ARE SHARED BY THE OTHER

03:03:06.508 --> 03:03:09.144
TRUSTEES. IN A CHAIRMAN ADAM

03:03:09.211 --> 03:03:10.512
DAY WHO ARE FULLY AWARE IN

03:03:10.579 --> 03:03:11.080
SUPPORT OF THE CS USERS ARE

03:03:11.146 --> 03:03:13.382
POLICY. I BELIEVE CHAIRMAN DAYS

03:03:13.449 --> 03:03:16.118
SHOULD A LETTER TO THIS EFFECT.

03:03:16.185 --> 03:03:17.286
I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY

03:03:17.353 --> 03:03:18.654
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE I KNOW

03:03:18.721 --> 03:03:20.055
TURN OVER CHANCELLOR WHITE WHO

03:03:20.122 --> 03:03:20.622
HAS A FEW ADDITIONAL OPENING

03:03:20.689 --> 03:03:26.061
REMARKS. PLEASE WAS RIGHT. I

03:03:26.128 --> 03:03:27.496
WISH TO ELABORATE FOR JUST A

03:03:27.563 --> 03:03:29.932
MOMENT ON TO THE AUTO REPORTS

03:03:29.998 --> 03:03:32.334
OVER WRITING SEEMS AND TO THE

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:32.968
ISSUES THAT CAME UP EARLIER ON.

03:03:33.035 --> 03:03:36.105
CHEERS AND SALAS. THE TWO WATER

03:03:36.171 --> 03:03:36.572
REPORT SEEMS WHILE NOT

03:03:36.638 --> 03:03:40.275
UNTRUTHFUL. WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY

03:03:40.342 --> 03:03:42.144
MISLEADING AND WHICH HAVE BEEN

03:03:42.211 --> 03:03:42.611
FURTHER DISTORTED AND

03:03:42.678 --> 03:03:45.447
EXAGGERATED IN THE MEDIA. THE

03:03:45.514 --> 03:03:46.982
FIRST IS THE NOTION THAT WE

03:03:47.049 --> 03:03:48.584
WERE ACCUMULATING AN ENORMOUS

03:03:48.650 --> 03:03:49.184
SURPLUS WHILE NEARLY DOUBLING

03:03:49.251 --> 03:03:52.955
TUITION DURING THE AUDIT PERIOD.

03:03:53.021 --> 03:03:56.525
LET ME ADDRESS TUITION FIRST.

03:03:56.592 --> 03:03:58.594
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND

03:03:58.660 --> 03:03:59.762
I HAVE NO IDEA ALLOW REFER TO

03:03:59.828 --> 03:04:01.330
IT AS A GREAT RECESSION I DON'T

03:04:01.397 --> 03:04:03.999
KNOW ANYBODY WAS GREAT FOR. BUT

03:04:04.066 --> 03:04:06.502
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME THE

03:04:06.568 --> 03:04:07.035
CSU LOS MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

03:04:07.102 --> 03:04:10.706
STATE FUNDING. IN FACT AT ONE

03:04:10.773 --> 03:04:13.308
POINT WE LOST ALMOST ONE THIRD%

03:04:13.375 --> 03:04:14.810
OF OUR STATE APPROPRIATION IN

03:04:14.877 --> 03:04:18.680
JUST A MATTER OF MONTHS. NINE

03:04:18.747 --> 03:04:20.516
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION

03:04:20.582 --> 03:04:22.751
DOLLARS IN A MATTER OF MONTHS

03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:24.186
FROM A GENERAL FUND

03:04:24.253 --> 03:04:27.423
APPROPRIATION OF TWO POINT NINE

03:04:27.489 --> 03:04:28.023
SEVEN ONE DOWN TO TWO BILLION

03:04:28.090 --> 03:04:32.261
DOLLARS. TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE

03:04:32.327 --> 03:04:33.362
THAT DRAMATIC LOSS OF STATE

03:04:33.429 --> 03:04:36.031
FUNDS CSU WAS FORCED TO

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:37.599
INSTITUTE CAN PERCENTAGE

03:04:37.666 --> 03:04:39.768
INCREASES TO OUR TUITION AND

03:04:39.835 --> 03:04:42.571
RECOVERED TWO THIRDS ONLY OF

03:04:42.638 --> 03:04:45.574
THAT LOSS AND WE CUT EXPENSES.

03:04:45.641 --> 03:04:47.075
BUT SINCE THAT TIME OVER THE

03:04:47.142 --> 03:04:48.310
COURSE OF THE PAST EIGHT YEARS

03:04:48.377 --> 03:04:51.180
AS TRUSTEE MCGRORY JUST SAID WE

03:04:51.246 --> 03:04:52.614
HAVE INCREASED TUITION ONLY

03:04:52.681 --> 03:04:54.216
ONCE BY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

03:04:54.283 --> 03:04:56.985
DOLLARS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND

03:04:57.052 --> 03:04:57.719
SEVENTEEN WHEN WE DID NOT

03:04:57.786 --> 03:04:59.788
RECEIVE THE EXPECTED IN NEEDED

03:04:59.855 --> 03:05:02.524
STATE APPROPRIATION. AND THAT

03:05:02.591 --> 03:05:04.293
REVENUE WAS ALL DIRECTED THE

03:05:04.359 --> 03:05:06.328
GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY

03:05:06.395 --> 03:05:07.930
TWENTY FIVE. THE EARLY RESULTS

03:05:07.996 --> 03:05:09.631
OF WHICH ARE SHOWING INITIATIVE

03:05:09.698 --> 03:05:11.133
TO BE OF A TRANSFORMATIVE

03:05:11.200 --> 03:05:13.235
BENEFIT. TO OUR STUDENTS INTO

03:05:13.302 --> 03:05:16.238
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE

03:05:16.305 --> 03:05:16.805
ALSO GRATEFUL THAT OUR STATE

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:21.510
APPROPRIATION. COME TWENTY

03:05:21.577 --> 03:05:22.110
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HAS RETURNED

03:05:22.177 --> 03:05:24.346
TO THE PRE RECESSION LEVELS AND

03:05:24.413 --> 03:05:26.515
TODAY WE SERVE FORTY ONE

03:05:26.582 --> 03:05:27.115
THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS AND TEN

03:05:27.182 --> 03:05:31.420
YEARS AGO. DURING THIS TIME

03:05:31.487 --> 03:05:32.588
FRAME THAT IS THE SCOPE OF THIS

03:05:32.654 --> 03:05:34.423
AUDIT AND LARGELY IN RESPONSE

03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:36.158
TO THE LESSONS OF THE RECESSION

03:05:36.225 --> 03:05:38.227
WE DILIGENTLY SAYS SIDE FUNDS

03:05:38.293 --> 03:05:40.596
IN RESERVE TO PROTECT AGAINST

03:05:40.662 --> 03:05:41.163
THE NEXT INEVITABLE ECONOMIC

03:05:41.230 --> 03:05:43.765
DOWNTURN. ARE RESERVED FOR

03:05:43.832 --> 03:05:45.601
BUILT AND THINK ABOUT THIS FOR

03:05:45.667 --> 03:05:48.136
A MOMENT AT A RATE OF LESS THAN

03:05:48.203 --> 03:05:49.238
ONE PERCENT. OF OUR ANNUAL

03:05:49.304 --> 03:05:51.206
OPERATING BUDGET A MODEST

03:05:51.273 --> 03:05:52.341
GROWTH ON A PERCENT OF BUDGET

03:05:52.407 --> 03:05:55.878
BASIS. THE IMPLICATION THAT WE

03:05:55.944 --> 03:05:58.046
HAVE BEEN HOARDING MONEY WHILE

03:05:58.113 --> 03:05:59.381
REPEATEDLY RAISING TUITION IS

03:05:59.448 --> 03:06:03.285
FUNDAMENTALLY MISLEADING. SO

03:06:03.352 --> 03:06:04.686
WHERE DID THE RESERVE FUND COME

03:06:04.753 --> 03:06:07.422
FROM REALLY ONLY TWO WAYS FIRST

03:06:07.489 --> 03:06:08.924
THEY COME FROM THE RETURNS ARE

03:06:08.991 --> 03:06:10.993
ON OUR INVESTMENTS MANAGED

03:06:11.059 --> 03:06:12.528
EXPERTLY BY OUR INVESTMENT

03:06:12.594 --> 03:06:14.696
COMMITTEE. AND SECOND WE GET

03:06:14.763 --> 03:06:17.199
THEM BY EXPENDITURE SAVINGS AS

03:06:17.266 --> 03:06:18.600
I MENTIONED EARLIER THETWO

03:06:18.667 --> 03:06:20.335
HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND

03:06:20.402 --> 03:06:21.103
FOURTEEN LAW THAT SHIFTED

03:06:21.169 --> 03:06:23.038
FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FROM

03:06:23.105 --> 03:06:24.306
CAPITAL PROJECTS FROM THE STATE

03:06:24.373 --> 03:06:26.275
TO THE CSU AT THAT TIME WE

03:06:26.341 --> 03:06:27.442
INSTRUCTED OUR CAMPUSES TO

03:06:27.509 --> 03:06:29.311
BEGIN TO SET ASIDE RESERVE

03:06:29.378 --> 03:06:30.646
FUNDS TO COVER A PORTION OF

03:06:30.712 --> 03:06:33.649
THOSE PROJECTS TO MODERNIZE

03:06:33.715 --> 03:06:34.249
AGING BUILDINGS ARE. BUILDING

03:06:34.316 --> 03:06:37.119
FACILITIES. AND AT THE END OF

03:06:37.185 --> 03:06:37.753
EACH FISCAL YEAR WHEN THERE'S A

03:06:37.819 --> 03:06:39.555
SAVINGS IN OPERATING COSTS WE

03:06:39.621 --> 03:06:40.822
HAVE BUDGET IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT

03:06:40.889 --> 03:06:42.858
OF MONEY AND HAVE SPENT LESS WE

03:06:42.925 --> 03:06:44.092
PUT THAT SAVINGS INTO SPECIFIC

03:06:44.159 --> 03:06:46.261
DESIGNATED RESERVES. THOSE ARE

03:06:46.328 --> 03:06:46.795
THE SOURCES OF OUR RESERVE

03:06:46.862 --> 03:06:50.799
FUNDS. THIS LEADS ME THEN TO

03:06:50.866 --> 03:06:51.733
ANOTHER IMPLICATION THAT I FIND

03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:53.669
FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR. AND WE'VE

03:06:53.735 --> 03:06:55.771
BEEN USING TUITION DOLLARS TO

03:06:55.837 --> 03:06:57.606
FUND OUR RESERVES. IT'S ANOTHER

03:06:57.673 --> 03:06:59.775
NOTION THAT WHILE NOT

03:06:59.841 --> 03:07:01.677
UNTRUTHFUL IS PROFOUNDLY

03:07:01.743 --> 03:07:04.680
MISLEADING HERE'S WHY. FIRST

03:07:04.746 --> 03:07:06.715
THE AUDIT REPORT ONLY FOCUSED

03:07:06.782 --> 03:07:08.016
ON STATE TRUST FUNDS HELD

03:07:08.083 --> 03:07:10.752
OUTSIDE THE STATE TREASURY.

03:07:10.819 --> 03:07:12.287
THERE IS NO STATE GENERAL FUND

03:07:12.354 --> 03:07:15.157
APPROPRIATION IN TRUST FUNDS.

03:07:15.223 --> 03:07:17.593
IN FURTHER AS REQUIRED BY LAW

03:07:17.659 --> 03:07:18.994
IN THE BUDGET ACT TO MEET OUR

03:07:19.061 --> 03:07:20.829
OPERATING COSTS WE SPEND NO

03:07:20.896 --> 03:07:22.931
MORE THAN ONE TWELFTH OF OUR

03:07:22.998 --> 03:07:24.266
GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION EACH

03:07:24.333 --> 03:07:25.567
MONTH FOR THE FIRST TEN MONTHS

03:07:25.634 --> 03:07:29.237
OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AND THEN

03:07:29.304 --> 03:07:30.439
SPEND THE BALANCE OF OUR STATE

03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:33.609
ALLOCATION EVERY MAY. WE USED

03:07:33.675 --> 03:07:34.242
TO OCEAN DOLLARS EVERY MONTH AS

03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:37.512
WELL. SO AT THE END OF THE

03:07:37.579 --> 03:07:40.082
FISCAL YEAR IN JUNE WE'VE SPENT

03:07:40.148 --> 03:07:42.384
DOWN A 100% OF OUR STATE

03:07:42.451 --> 03:07:44.720
APPROPRIATION AND MOST BUT NOT

03:07:44.786 --> 03:07:47.022
ALL OF OUR TUITION DOLLARS.

03:07:47.089 --> 03:07:48.190
ANYTHING THAT'S LEFT IN THE

03:07:48.256 --> 03:07:50.492
UNSPENT MONEYS RISE I MENTIONED

03:07:50.559 --> 03:07:51.660
A MOMENT AGO WE DESIGNATE AS

03:07:51.727 --> 03:07:55.030
RESERVES THEY ARE BOUND TO BE

03:07:55.097 --> 03:07:55.664
TUITION DOLLARS OR THE INTEREST

03:07:55.731 --> 03:07:58.133
EARNINGS. OUR FINANCIAL

03:07:58.200 --> 03:08:00.669
OPERATIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE

03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:03.238
STATUTORILY MANDATED INSURER

03:08:03.305 --> 03:08:05.007
THAT ANY OPERATIONAL FUNDS THAT

03:08:05.073 --> 03:08:06.808
ARE NOT SPENT AT THE END OF THE

03:08:06.875 --> 03:08:07.442
YEAR CAN ONLY COME FROM TUITION

03:08:07.509 --> 03:08:10.646
OR INTEREST. THE AUTO REPORTS

03:08:10.712 --> 03:08:11.313
IMPLICATION THAT WE

03:08:11.380 --> 03:08:12.981
DISPROPORTIONATELY USED OUR

03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:14.449
TUITION DOLLARS TO BUILD OUR

03:08:14.516 --> 03:08:14.916
RESERVES IS THEREFORE

03:08:14.983 --> 03:08:23.692
MISLEADING. YOUR SALAS YOU

03:08:23.759 --> 03:08:25.060
RAISE THAT MANY MEMBERS WERE

03:08:25.127 --> 03:08:26.361
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAN DIEGO

03:08:26.428 --> 03:08:29.665
STATE PARKING SITUATION. SEND

03:08:29.731 --> 03:08:31.533
YOU THE STATE INCREASED PARKING

03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:33.402
RATES THE QUESTION IS TO THE

03:08:33.468 --> 03:08:34.970
INCREASE PART WAYS TO BUILD A

03:08:35.037 --> 03:08:35.537
PARKING STRUCTURE FOR RETAIL

FORWARD. PER OUR LAST MEETING I

03:12:18.627 --> 03:12:19.928
LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE

03:12:19.995 --> 03:12:21.897
CAN WORK TOGETHER ON REFORMING

03:12:21.963 --> 03:12:25.700
THE TRANSPARENCY. PORTAL AND

03:12:25.767 --> 03:12:30.171
POTENTIALLY THE RESERVES POLICY.

03:12:30.238 --> 03:12:31.473
BUT LET'S BE REAL. A MAJORITY

03:12:31.539 --> 03:12:32.674
OF CSUSTUDENTS HAVE NOT HEARD

03:12:32.741 --> 03:12:33.341
ABOUT THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE

03:12:33.408 --> 03:12:34.109
AUDIT. AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE

03:12:34.175 --> 03:12:36.344
READ IT IT IS STILL REALLY HARD

03:12:36.411 --> 03:12:38.046
TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH WHEN

03:12:38.113 --> 03:12:39.948
YOU'VE BEEN. WHEN YOU'VE HEARD

03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:41.883
TWO VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:43.418
THE CSU HAS DEFENDED THEIR

03:12:43.485 --> 03:12:45.420
RESERVE THE STATE AUDITOR'S

03:12:45.487 --> 03:12:46.888
REPORT OFFICE REPORTS IT AS A

03:12:46.955 --> 03:12:49.357
SURPLUS IN THE FOLLOWING AND A

03:12:49.424 --> 03:12:50.859
FOLLOW UP MEETING WITH VICE

03:12:50.926 --> 03:12:52.360
CHANCELLOR RALLY A WHEN ASKED

03:12:52.427 --> 03:12:53.929
OF THIS YEAR'S YOU COULD SHOW

03:12:53.995 --> 03:12:55.163
US WHERE IN LAST YEAR'S

03:12:55.230 --> 03:12:56.998
FINANCIAL STATEMENT. IS THE

03:12:57.065 --> 03:13:00.435
RESERVE SLASH SURPLUS DISCLOSED

03:13:00.502 --> 03:13:01.002
THE LINE ITEM IS LABELED AS

03:13:01.069 --> 03:13:03.738
INVESTMENTS. SO WHILE THERE'S

03:13:03.805 --> 03:13:05.206
BEEN GREAT DEBATE BETWEEN THE

03:13:05.273 --> 03:13:06.775
TWO STAKEHOLDERS OVER WHAT TO

03:13:06.841 --> 03:13:08.743
CALL THESE FUNDS. I THINK WE

03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:10.779
CAN ALL DO A BETTER JOB AT

03:13:10.845 --> 03:13:12.247
ENGAGING THE MOST IMPORTANT

03:13:12.314 --> 03:13:13.882
STAKEHOLDER OF ALL. WHICH OUR

03:13:13.949 --> 03:13:16.384
STUDENTS. AT THE END OF THE DAY

03:13:16.451 --> 03:13:17.385
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

03:13:17.452 --> 03:13:19.621
ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT OR NON

03:13:19.688 --> 03:13:21.222
DISCLOSURE OF DIRECT STUDENT

03:13:21.289 --> 03:13:23.291
DOLLARS. THE TRUTH SHOULD NOT

03:13:23.358 --> 03:13:26.194
BE THIS HARD TO PURSUE. AS A

03:13:26.261 --> 03:13:28.029
REPRESENTATIVE FOR CSU STUDENTS

03:13:28.096 --> 03:13:30.165
I SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE SYSTEM

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:32.067
AND HAVING A RESERVE AS PART OF

03:13:32.133 --> 03:13:34.135
THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE MAIN

03:13:34.202 --> 03:13:35.904
CONCERN FROM STUDENTS IS NOT

03:13:35.971 --> 03:13:38.306
THAT THE CSU HAS A RESERVE. BUT

03:13:38.373 --> 03:13:39.975
IT'S THAT WE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT

03:13:40.041 --> 03:13:40.809
IT AND WE STILL CONTINUE TO

03:13:40.875 --> 03:13:42.944
HAVE GAPS IN INFORMATION. THE

03:13:43.011 --> 03:13:44.479
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DID NOT

03:13:44.546 --> 03:13:45.847
DISCLOSE THE RESERVES TO

03:13:45.914 --> 03:13:47.148
STUDENTS WHEN PROPOSING TUITION

03:13:47.215 --> 03:13:49.317
INCREASES. EVEN THOUGH THE BEEN

03:13:49.384 --> 03:13:51.119
MANDATED BY LAW TO PROVIDE

03:13:51.186 --> 03:13:52.654
STUDENTS WITH INFORMATION

03:13:52.721 --> 03:13:54.756
ABOUT. ALTERNATIVES TO RAISING

03:13:54.823 --> 03:13:56.858
TUITION SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

03:13:56.925 --> 03:13:59.461
INPUT AND ASK QUESTIONS. THIS

03:13:59.527 --> 03:14:00.729
IS PROBLEMATIC ESPECIALLY

03:14:00.795 --> 03:14:01.997
BECAUSE TUITION DOLLARS

03:14:02.063 --> 03:14:04.699
DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO RESERVE.

03:14:04.766 --> 03:14:05.767
ONE OF OUR BIGGEST GAPS IN

03:14:05.834 --> 03:14:07.702
KNOWLEDGE INCLUDE NOT KNOWING

03:14:07.769 --> 03:14:08.770
WHAT THE ROLE THAT TUITION

03:14:08.837 --> 03:14:10.839
PLAYS AND REACHING THE CS USE

03:14:10.905 --> 03:14:13.742
GOALS FOR A LARGER RESERVE. I

03:14:13.808 --> 03:14:15.910
SPENT THE PAST FEW WEEKS TRYING

03:14:15.977 --> 03:14:17.145
TO SIFT THROUGH THE DIFFERENT

03:14:17.212 --> 03:14:18.813
INFORMATION BEING GIVEN TO

03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:21.516
STUDENTS BUT ALSO GAUGING HOW

03:14:21.583 --> 03:14:22.584
STUDENTS HAVE BEEN FEELING

03:14:22.650 --> 03:14:24.386
ABOUT THE AUDIT. I ACTUALLY

03:14:24.452 --> 03:14:26.087
JUST CAME FROM US CAL STATE

03:14:26.154 --> 03:14:27.889
FULLERTON FOR MARCY S. UNITY

03:14:27.956 --> 03:14:29.958
CONFERENCE COMPRISING A STUDENT

03:14:30.025 --> 03:14:31.626
LEADERS ACROSS ALL OF OUR

03:14:31.693 --> 03:14:32.761
TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES WHILE

03:14:32.827 --> 03:14:34.696
MANY STUDENTS CANNOT BE IT AN

03:14:34.763 --> 03:14:35.663
ATTENDANCE TODAY DUE TO

03:14:35.730 --> 03:14:37.499
WRAPPING UP OUR CONFERENCE. I

03:14:37.565 --> 03:14:39.300
GOT OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK

03:14:39.367 --> 03:14:40.602
REGARDING THE FINDINGS AND

03:14:40.668 --> 03:14:41.936
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PARKING

03:14:42.003 --> 03:14:44.272
SIDE OF THE AUDIT SPECIFICALLY

03:14:44.339 --> 03:14:45.907
IT SEEMS LIKE THE PARKING

03:14:45.974 --> 03:14:46.941
DISCUSSION HAS NOT HAD THE

03:14:47.008 --> 03:14:51.413
FOCUS DESERVES IN COMPARISON TO

03:14:51.479 --> 03:14:52.013
THE RESERVE. SLASHER POSSIBLY

03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:55.617
DEBATE. DISCUSSING THE COSTA

STUDENT PARKING AND HOW IT

03:14:56.651 --> 03:14:58.453
AFFECTS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY I

03:14:58.520 --> 03:14:59.654
WOULD LIKE TO CHALLENGE WITH

03:14:59.721 --> 03:15:01.222
THE SYSTEM AND THE STATE TO DO

03:15:01.289 --> 03:15:03.224
BETTER. BECAUSE A SEEMINGLY

03:15:03.291 --> 03:15:06.361
LOWER EXPENSE MEANS 20% OF THE

03:15:06.428 --> 03:15:08.830
MONTHLY PAYCHECK FOR YOUR SALAS

03:15:08.897 --> 03:15:11.332

03:15:11.399 --> 03:15:12.834
MEAN STUDENTS LIKE OF JANA

IF IT'S. FOR AFTER A WHILE A

03:21:58.473 --> 03:22:08.182
PROJECT OR FOR ANOTHER ITEM.

03:22:08.249 --> 03:22:10.451
OBSERVERS THEY'RE ENCUMBRANCES

03:22:10.518 --> 03:22:13.020
FOR CONTRACTS HUNDRED MILLION

03:22:13.087 --> 03:22:13.554
DOLLARS CONTRACT REWARDED

03:22:13.621 --> 03:22:14.121
ENTERED INTO THAT WE HAVE TO

03:22:14.188 --> 03:22:16.591
PAY. STE SOME CAMPUSES WANT TO

03:22:16.657 --> 03:22:17.859
BUILD NEW FACILITIES I KNOW IS

03:22:17.925 --> 03:22:19.827
INVOLVED SAN DIEGO STATE WE

03:22:19.894 --> 03:22:20.428
BUILT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

03:22:20.495 --> 03:22:23.197
ENGINEERING COMPLEX. A THIRD OF

03:22:23.264 --> 03:22:24.599
IT CAME FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS A

03:22:24.665 --> 03:22:26.033
THIRD OF IT CAME FROM THIS FROM

03:22:26.100 --> 03:22:27.902
THE CSU AND A THIRD CAME FROM

03:22:27.969 --> 03:22:29.070
FLAT TO PRE. THE THIRD THE CAME

03:22:29.136 --> 03:22:30.371
THE CAMPUS THEY SAVE UP THE

03:22:30.438 --> 03:22:34.242
MONEY TO PUT IN THE CASH TO

03:22:34.308 --> 03:22:34.775
COVER THEIR THIRTY MILLION

03:22:34.842 --> 03:22:35.343
DOLLAR SIGN. THAT'S IN THESE

03:22:35.409 --> 03:22:38.779
NUMBERS. SO THAT IS NOT. THE RE

03:22:38.846 --> 03:22:39.714
A RESERVE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

03:22:39.780 --> 03:22:41.449
MISNOMER. AND THE MONEY THEY

03:22:41.516 --> 03:22:44.085
CHIU APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR.

03:22:44.151 --> 03:22:45.486
ONE TIME MONEY FOR YOUR

03:22:45.553 --> 03:22:47.488
INCREASE ENROLLMENT. SITS IN A

03:22:47.555 --> 03:22:48.923
IN AN ACCOUNT THAT HAS A

03:22:48.990 --> 03:22:49.457
HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION

03:22:49.524 --> 03:22:50.625
DOLLARS AND- THAT'S PART OF

03:22:50.691 --> 03:22:51.959
THESE NUMBERS. SO HOW WOULD YOU

03:22:52.026 --> 03:22:53.594
ACCOUNT BECAUSE EARLIER WE

03:22:53.661 --> 03:22:57.865
HEARD. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION.

03:22:57.932 --> 03:23:00.501
BELIEVE THE STATE AUDITOR'S.

03:23:00.568 --> 03:23:02.003
OFFICE SAID NINETY FIVE MILLION

03:23:02.069 --> 03:23:03.371
OF THAT WAS INCOME MURDER TIED

03:23:03.437 --> 03:23:04.205
TO CONTRACTS AND YOU'RE SAYING

03:23:04.272 --> 03:23:05.573
THERE'S MORE THAN THAT. WELL

03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:07.174
YOU YOUR YOUR APPROPRIATIONS

03:23:07.241 --> 03:23:08.376
FROM LAST YEAR TO FOR FURTHER

03:23:08.442 --> 03:23:10.511
FOR MOMENT SITS THERE BECAUSE

03:23:10.578 --> 03:23:11.078
IT'S GONNA BE SPENT ONE TIME

03:23:11.145 --> 03:23:14.949
OVER FOUR YEARS. SO SITTING IN

03:23:15.016 --> 03:23:16.984
IN IN THIS IN AN ACCOUNT THAT

03:23:17.051 --> 03:23:18.753
IS IN THIS BROAD ONE POINT FIVE

03:23:18.819 --> 03:23:20.021
BILLION DOLLAR CATEGORY. YOU

03:23:20.087 --> 03:23:21.122
REALLY HAVE TO GO ON TO THE

03:23:21.188 --> 03:23:22.523
WEBSITE AND BREAK IT BREAK IT

03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:24.625
THESE NUMBERS DONE THE REAL

03:23:24.692 --> 03:23:25.993
RAINY DAY RESERVE WHICH IS

03:23:26.060 --> 03:23:27.161
EQUIVALENT TO YOUR RAINY DAY

03:23:27.228 --> 03:23:28.763
RESERVE. IS FOUR HUNDRED

03:23:28.829 --> 03:23:31.065
MILLION DOLLARS. THE REST OF IT

03:23:31.132 --> 03:23:31.999
IS AND WHAT'S CALLED DESIGNATED

03:23:32.066 --> 03:23:33.968
RESERVES. AND AGAIN FOR A

03:23:34.035 --> 03:23:35.169
MILLION DOLLARS IS THREE WEEKS

03:23:35.236 --> 03:23:36.704
WORTH OF OPERATING REVENUE WITH

03:23:36.771 --> 03:23:38.739
THAT THIS IS NOT. A HUGE

03:23:38.806 --> 03:23:40.174
RESERVE AND MOST PEOPLE SAYS

03:23:40.241 --> 03:23:41.609
UNDER ITS UNDER WHAT IT SHOULD

03:23:41.676 --> 03:23:42.843
BE. CORRECT AND I THINK THAT'S

03:23:42.910 --> 03:23:43.978
PROBABLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE

03:23:44.045 --> 03:23:46.280
HAVING SOME CONFUSION FOR THE

03:23:46.347 --> 03:23:46.881
CLARITY BECAUSE I HEARD THAT

03:23:46.948 --> 03:23:47.448
MISTER WHITE OF HIS COMMENTS

03:23:47.515 --> 03:23:50.384
SAY. LESSON ABOUT 1% LESS THAN

03:23:50.451 --> 03:23:52.553
1% OF OPERATING FUNDS FOR

03:23:52.620 --> 03:23:53.187
RESERVE BUT THEN WHEN WE DID

03:23:53.254 --> 03:23:55.022
THE MATH IN THE EARLIER PANEL.

03:23:55.089 --> 03:23:56.691
IF YOU DO ONE POINT FIVE BASED

03:23:56.757 --> 03:23:58.759
ON ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WITH.

03:23:58.826 --> 03:24:01.329
THE YEARLY CSU ALLOCATION THAT

03:24:01.395 --> 03:24:02.697
AMOUNTS TO ABOUT TWENTY

03:24:02.763 --> 03:24:03.998
PERCENT. SO THE TWENTY

03:24:04.065 --> 03:24:05.833
PERCENTERS AT 1% I THINK THAT'S

03:24:05.900 --> 03:24:07.702
WHERE WERE EVERYONE HAS. THESE

03:24:07.768 --> 03:24:09.370
QUESTIONS ON THE CLARITY AND

03:24:09.437 --> 03:24:13.741
WHAT THESE NUMBERS ACTUALLY.

03:24:13.808 --> 03:24:14.342
MEAN AND WHAT THEY MEAN TO THE

03:24:14.408 --> 03:24:18.813
PUBLIC ARE THESE. IS IT NINETY

03:24:18.879 --> 03:24:19.480
FIVE MILLION ONLY IN COVERED IS

03:24:19.547 --> 03:24:20.715
IT MORE BECAUSE IT'S- TAKING

03:24:20.781 --> 03:24:22.283
INTO ACCOUNT THAT. MAYBE THEY

03:24:22.350 --> 03:24:22.917
WERE BUDGET ACTIONS WE'VE SAID

03:24:22.984 --> 03:24:23.551
WE WANT TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT

03:24:23.618 --> 03:24:24.919
AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT

03:24:24.986 --> 03:24:25.553
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HERE

03:24:25.620 --> 03:24:26.220
TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE.

03:24:26.287 --> 03:24:27.254
A LOT OF AB THE CONFUSING

03:24:27.321 --> 03:24:28.756
HEADLINES AND EVERYTHING ELSE

03:24:28.823 --> 03:24:29.824
IS COMING FROM AND WE'RE OPEN

03:24:29.890 --> 03:24:31.792
TO GET SOME CLARITY ON. I

03:24:31.859 --> 03:24:32.393
NOTICED RUDY HAS A QUESTION ON

03:24:32.460 --> 03:24:34.895
THIS VERY ISSUE. ON SO WHAT

03:24:34.962 --> 03:24:37.131
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. ACTUALLY

03:24:37.198 --> 03:24:38.099
FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WHEN YOU

03:24:38.165 --> 03:24:40.668
TAKE AWAY. THE OTHER CAMPUSES

03:24:40.735 --> 03:24:42.503
THE TWENTY THREE CAPS IS THAT

03:24:42.570 --> 03:24:45.306
THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THE-

03:24:45.373 --> 03:24:47.875
ONE POINT FIVE. WHERE DO YOU

03:24:47.942 --> 03:24:50.378
GET THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION.

03:24:50.444 --> 03:24:51.312
OR OR OR IT ANOTHER WAY TO ASK

03:24:51.379 --> 03:24:54.582
THE SAME QUESTION THE TWENTY

03:24:54.649 --> 03:24:55.216
THREE CAMPUSES AND THE MANY. OF

03:24:55.282 --> 03:24:57.952
THE- HELD IN RESERVE OR

03:24:58.019 --> 03:25:00.087
ENCUMBERED IN THE TWENTY THREE

03:25:00.154 --> 03:25:03.891
CAMPUSES IT IS WHAT AMOUNT. OF

03:25:03.958 --> 03:25:07.628
THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION.

03:25:07.695 --> 03:25:08.162
BECAUSE THE ONE POINT FIVE

03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:11.399
MILLION INCLUDES MONEY. ONE

03:25:11.465 --> 03:25:15.136
POINT FIVE BILLION. INCLUDES

03:25:15.202 --> 03:25:16.771
THE MONEY ON THAT IN THE TWENTY

03:25:16.837 --> 03:25:18.606
THREE CAMPUSES CORRECT YES. AND

03:25:18.673 --> 03:25:21.242
IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE. THE

03:25:21.308 --> 03:25:22.910
FORTY MILLION IN OTHER WORDS

03:25:22.977 --> 03:25:24.745
I'M GOING BACK TO ASSEMBLY

03:25:24.812 --> 03:25:26.113
MEMBER TINGS QUESTION AND OUT

03:25:26.180 --> 03:25:28.449
AND I WANT TO TRY TO.

03:25:28.516 --> 03:25:30.051
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE CSU

03:25:30.117 --> 03:25:34.121
AND THE UC. AND DOCTOR WHITE

03:25:34.188 --> 03:25:35.923
SINCE YOU WERE IT UC RIVERSIDE.

03:25:35.990 --> 03:25:40.094
AND WE. VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR

03:25:40.161 --> 03:25:42.496
SERVICE THERE AT UC ARE ARE THE

03:25:42.563 --> 03:25:44.832
ARE THE TWO SIS ISN'T DIFFERENT

03:25:44.899 --> 03:25:50.171
DO DOES UC. I HAVE. RESERVES ON

03:25:50.237 --> 03:25:51.706
THE CAMPUS LEVEL OR OR THE

03:25:51.772 --> 03:25:52.973
RESERVES IN THE UC ONLY AT THE

03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:57.378
PRESIDENT'S. OFFICE IF YOU

03:25:57.445 --> 03:25:59.413
COULD EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES

03:25:59.480 --> 03:26:01.849
AT THE TIME I WAS CHANCERY. A

03:26:01.916 --> 03:26:03.651
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE

03:26:03.718 --> 03:26:06.854
WE HAD RESERVES ON CAMPUS. AS

03:26:06.921 --> 03:26:10.157
WELL AS THE RESERVES IN THE. IN

03:26:10.224 --> 03:26:11.492
THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND

03:26:11.559 --> 03:26:13.060
THE SAME IS TRUE AT CALIFORNIA

03:26:13.127 --> 03:26:14.562
STATE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE

03:26:14.628 --> 03:26:16.230
RESERVES HELD IN THIS

03:26:16.297 --> 03:26:18.199
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MY OFFICE.

03:26:18.265 --> 03:26:19.900
AND INNER RESERVES HELD ON THE

03:26:19.967 --> 03:26:21.001
CAMPUS IS A TWENTY IN THE

03:26:21.068 --> 03:26:23.237
RESERVES AND IN THE YOUR OFFICE

03:26:23.304 --> 03:26:27.675
AMOUNTS TO. SO THE RESERVE FOR

03:26:27.742 --> 03:26:30.945
OUR OPERATING COSTS AT THE

03:26:31.011 --> 03:26:32.813
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IS AROUND

03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:36.851
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS. BUT WE

03:26:36.917 --> 03:26:39.954
ALSO HOLD RESERVES FOR THE

03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:42.690
CAMPUS IS SORRY FOR EXAMPLE OF

03:26:42.757 --> 03:26:43.457
THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION

03:26:43.524 --> 03:26:45.092
DOLLARS FOR A ROMAN BOTH THE

03:26:45.159 --> 03:26:46.427
CAME IN ONE TIME FUNDING A YEAR

03:26:46.494 --> 03:26:49.396
OR SO AGO. WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING

03:26:49.463 --> 03:26:50.464
ABOUT NINETY MILLION OF THAT

03:26:50.531 --> 03:26:52.967
DISTRIBUTED OUT OF 20% THE

03:26:53.033 --> 03:26:54.869
FIRST YEAR ABOUT 25% THE SECOND

03:26:54.935 --> 03:26:57.371
YEAR TO THOSE RESERVES ARE HELD

03:26:57.438 --> 03:26:57.972
IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT

03:26:58.038 --> 03:27:00.508
THEY'RE NOT. HELD AGAINST OUR

03:27:00.574 --> 03:27:02.176
OPERATING COSTS THROUGH THE

03:27:02.243 --> 03:27:02.710
EARMARKED ALREADY FOR THE

03:27:02.777 --> 03:27:05.045
CAMPUS RIGHT. OUR ROUTE SEVENTY

03:27:05.112 --> 03:27:09.617
MILLION DOLLARS. OF OUR RESERVE

03:27:09.683 --> 03:27:10.151
THAT WE HOLD THIS FOR MY

03:27:10.217 --> 03:27:12.653
OPERATIONS ONLY. ABOUT A LITTLE

03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:13.487
LESS THAN TWENTY FOR ECONOMIC

03:27:13.554 --> 03:27:15.256
UNCERTAINTY TWENTY MILLION.

03:27:15.322 --> 03:27:17.458
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR A

03:27:17.525 --> 03:27:18.626
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT OF OUR

03:27:18.692 --> 03:27:21.028
FACILITY. WE AREGOING THROUGH

03:27:21.095 --> 03:27:23.097
A RENOVATION OF THIS BUILDING

03:27:23.164 --> 03:27:24.698
WHICH ISN'T FROM THE TWENTY.

03:27:24.765 --> 03:27:25.766
FIVE YEAR MARK SO PUTTING IN

03:27:25.833 --> 03:27:27.735
NEW ELEVATORS NEW H. FAQ AND

03:27:27.802 --> 03:27:30.304
LIGHTING AND SEISMIC ETCETERA.

03:27:30.371 --> 03:27:31.105
AND THEN WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY

03:27:31.172 --> 03:27:31.872
SIX MILLION IN SHORT TERM

03:27:31.939 --> 03:27:34.842
OBLIGATIONS. SO WE DON'T SIT ON

03:27:34.909 --> 03:27:36.410
A LARGE RESERVE AT ALL. FOR THE

03:27:36.477 --> 03:27:39.480
OPERATIONS. I DO WANT TO MAKE.

03:27:39.547 --> 03:27:40.414
GERMAN CELLS I THINK ONE OF THE

03:27:40.481 --> 03:27:42.449
CONFUSION CERTAIN. POINTS THAT

03:27:42.516 --> 03:27:48.823
MAKES THIS COMPLEX. IS. THE

03:27:48.889 --> 03:27:49.423
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE USE OF

03:27:49.490 --> 03:27:54.595
ONE TIME MONEY. VERSES A BASED

03:27:54.662 --> 03:27:56.497
BUDGET ON GOING RESOURCE AND SO

03:27:56.564 --> 03:27:58.632
WHEN THERE IS A RESERVE FUND

03:27:58.699 --> 03:27:59.466
IT'S ONE TIME MONEY LIKE A

03:27:59.533 --> 03:28:01.302
PIGGY BANK IF YOU STARTED IF

03:28:01.368 --> 03:28:02.303
YOU MADE A COMMITMENT ON THAT

03:28:02.369 --> 03:28:03.070
THAT WAS GONNA LAST AND PREFER

03:28:03.137 --> 03:28:03.604
TO LIKE. HIRING PERMANENT

03:28:03.671 --> 03:28:07.508
FACULTY. IN OUR SERVERS YOU

03:28:07.575 --> 03:28:08.475
CAN'T DO THAT ON ONE TIME

03:28:08.542 --> 03:28:09.143
RESERVES HI SO WE'VE HAD A

03:28:09.210 --> 03:28:11.645
PRETTY CLEAR PRACTICE. TO NOT

03:28:11.712 --> 03:28:14.849
USE ONE TIME MONEY. FOR ONGOING

03:28:14.915 --> 03:28:16.650
NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. AND

03:28:16.717 --> 03:28:18.919
THE ONGOING NEED TO THE

03:28:18.986 --> 03:28:21.255
UNIVERSITY ARE SUPPORTED.

03:28:21.322 --> 03:28:24.358
VASTLY IN THE MAIN BY STATE

03:28:24.425 --> 03:28:26.260
ALLOCATION STATE APPROPRIATION

03:28:26.327 --> 03:28:27.194
GENERAL FUND CUT IN BY OUR

03:28:27.261 --> 03:28:29.463
TUITION DOLLARS NET TUITION

03:28:29.530 --> 03:28:32.600
DOLLARS AFTER FOR FINANCIALLY.

03:28:32.666 --> 03:28:33.968
THANK YOU DON'T APRECIATE THAT

03:28:34.034 --> 03:28:35.102
CLARITY AND LET ME JUST KIND OF

03:28:35.169 --> 03:28:35.569
PIGGY BACK OFF WHAT

03:28:35.636 --> 03:28:37.438
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA WAS. WAS

03:28:37.504 --> 03:28:38.739
SAYING BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE

03:28:38.806 --> 03:28:41.675
YACHT IT AND YOU KNOW PAGE

03:28:41.742 --> 03:28:42.409
FORTY EIGHT OF THE OUT OF

03:28:42.476 --> 03:28:43.878
REPORT. AND I SEE THAT THERE'S

03:28:43.944 --> 03:28:44.979
A SURPLUS BALLOTS FOR EACH

03:28:45.045 --> 03:28:47.214
CAMPUS BUT THEY VARY

03:28:47.281 --> 03:28:48.382
CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE

03:28:48.449 --> 03:28:51.318
CAMPUSES. YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT

03:28:51.385 --> 03:28:53.387
CAMPS LIKE FRESNO STATE THE

03:28:53.454 --> 03:28:58.492
NINTH LARGEST CSU BUT HAS A

03:28:58.559 --> 03:29:02.062
SIXTEEN. LARGEST SURPLUS. SAN

03:29:02.129 --> 03:29:03.330
DIEGO STATED CONTRAST THE

03:29:03.397 --> 03:29:04.832
FOURTH LARGEST CSU CAMPUS. AS A

03:29:04.899 --> 03:29:06.567
LITTLE MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY

03:29:06.634 --> 03:29:07.501
RESERVES AS LIKE SAY CSU

03:29:07.568 --> 03:29:09.503
FULLERTON WHICH- NOW QUIRK

03:29:09.570 --> 03:29:11.705
SILVA WAS TALKING ABOUT AND

03:29:11.772 --> 03:29:12.339
LONG BEACH WHICH ARE THE SECOND

03:29:12.406 --> 03:29:14.575
AND THIRD LARGEST CAMPUSES.

03:29:14.642 --> 03:29:16.010
SORT OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS

03:29:16.076 --> 03:29:17.144
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CRITERIA

03:29:17.211 --> 03:29:20.147
CSU USES FOR DETERMINING HOW

03:29:20.214 --> 03:29:21.582
LARGE ITS OVERALL RESERVE

03:29:21.649 --> 03:29:23.784
SHOULD BE. ALSO WHAT CRITERIA

03:29:23.851 --> 03:29:24.985
DOES YES YOU PROVIDE THE

03:29:25.052 --> 03:29:26.487
CAMPUSES TO HELP THEM DECIDE

03:29:26.553 --> 03:29:27.621
HOW MUCH TO MAINTAIN AND

03:29:27.688 --> 03:29:31.492
RESERVE. CONSIDERING THE VERY

03:29:31.558 --> 03:29:32.059
ABILITY BETWEEN. THE ENTIRE

03:29:32.126 --> 03:29:38.132
SYSTEM. YEAH MY NAME IS BRAD

03:29:38.198 --> 03:29:40.434
WELLS I WORK A CHANCE OFFICE IN

03:29:40.501 --> 03:29:42.069
BUSINESS AND FINANCE THANK YOU

03:29:42.136 --> 03:29:44.805
THE TABLE YOU'RE REFERENCING ON

03:29:44.872 --> 03:29:45.439
PAGE FORTY EIGHT. I BELIEVE THE

03:29:45.506 --> 03:29:48.742
TOTAL CASH. BALANCE IS AT A

03:29:48.809 --> 03:29:49.343
POINT IN TIME SO I THINK WE

03:29:49.410 --> 03:29:50.611
OUGHT IT IS AS OF JUNE

03:29:50.678 --> 03:29:51.979
THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

03:29:52.046 --> 03:29:52.980
THOSE WITH THE CASH BALANCES.

03:29:53.047 --> 03:29:54.214
FOR ALL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH

03:29:54.281 --> 03:29:55.416
THE UNIVERSITY. THAT WOULD

03:29:55.482 --> 03:29:57.551
INCLUDE HOUSING MONIES PARKING

03:29:57.618 --> 03:29:59.954
MONEY STUDENT UNION MONIES.

03:30:00.020 --> 03:30:01.622
WHAT THE AUDITOR'S DESCRIBED

03:30:01.689 --> 03:30:02.556
BUT THE AUDIT REPORT IS

03:30:02.623 --> 03:30:04.325
DESCRIBED AS RESTRICTED FUNDS

03:30:04.391 --> 03:30:06.493
IN ADDITION IT INCLUDES THE-

03:30:06.560 --> 03:30:08.395
RESERVE OUT THAT WERE

03:30:08.462 --> 03:30:10.497
DESCRIBING HERE EARLIER IS ONE

03:30:10.564 --> 03:30:11.532
POINT FIVE MILLION SO THAT'S

03:30:11.598 --> 03:30:13.334
THE TOTAL POT. THE REASON IS

03:30:13.400 --> 03:30:14.902
DIFFERENT SO DIFFERENT BY

03:30:14.969 --> 03:30:16.837
CAMPUSES BECAUSE CAMPUSES ARE

03:30:16.904 --> 03:30:18.605
QUITE DIFFERENT THE SMALLEST

03:30:18.672 --> 03:30:20.607
CAMPUS WE HAS HAVE HAS AN

03:30:20.674 --> 03:30:22.543
ANNUAL BUDGET OF FORTY SEVEN

03:30:22.609 --> 03:30:23.944
MILLION. THE LARGEST BUDGET WE

03:30:24.011 --> 03:30:25.913
HAPPENED LARGEST CAMPUS WE HAVE

03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:28.015
HAS AN ANNUAL BUDGET OF FOUR

03:30:28.082 --> 03:30:28.649
HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION. TO

03:30:28.716 --> 03:30:29.450
THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

03:30:29.516 --> 03:30:31.518
DIFFERENCE IN SIZE IT'S ALSO

03:30:31.585 --> 03:30:32.052
DIFFERENT THOUGH BECAUSE

03:30:32.119 --> 03:30:33.787
CAMPUSES HAVE MUCH SOME

03:30:33.854 --> 03:30:35.255
CAMPUSES HAVE MUCH LARGER

03:30:35.322 --> 03:30:37.825
STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAMS AGAIN.

03:30:37.891 --> 03:30:39.393
ONE OF THE SOURCES OF MONEY AND

03:30:39.460 --> 03:30:42.162
THAT PAGE FORTY EIGHT TABLE IS

03:30:42.229 --> 03:30:44.365
FROM STUDENT HOUSING. SOME CAPS

03:30:44.431 --> 03:30:45.833
HAVE VERY LARGE STUDENT UNION

03:30:45.899 --> 03:30:47.901
SO THERE ARE QUITE A VARIETY OF

03:30:47.968 --> 03:30:49.203
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT GENERATE

03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:50.938
CASH ON A CAMPUS AND THAT

03:30:51.005 --> 03:30:52.773
REPORT IS REALLY THE CASH

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:56.677
BALANCE. AT THAT POINT IN TIME

03:30:56.744 --> 03:30:57.511
JUNE THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND

03:30:57.578 --> 03:31:02.483
EIGHTEEN. WITH REGARD TO

03:31:02.549 --> 03:31:03.384
RESERVES NOW WE'RE GONNA SHOP

03:31:03.450 --> 03:31:04.251
I'M GONNA SHIFT HERE BACK TO

03:31:04.318 --> 03:31:06.720
THE ONE POINT FIVE. MILLION

03:31:06.787 --> 03:31:08.222
DOLLARS WHICH IS STILL IN THE

03:31:08.288 --> 03:31:10.357
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

03:31:10.424 --> 03:31:10.924
USING ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

03:31:10.991 --> 03:31:12.359
DOLLARS WORTH OF RESERVES. THAT

03:31:12.426 --> 03:31:13.527
IS A SUBSET OF THE TOTAL THAT'S

03:31:13.594 --> 03:31:14.995
ONLY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN OUR

03:31:15.062 --> 03:31:15.529
WHAT WE CALL OUR OPERATING

03:31:15.596 --> 03:31:18.599
FUND. IT'S THE GENERAL ACTIVITY

03:31:18.665 --> 03:31:20.401
OF THE UNIVERSITY THAT WE THAT

03:31:20.467 --> 03:31:22.403
WE USED TO PAY FACULTY TO

03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:24.438
INSTRUCT THAT WE PAY ACADEMIC

03:31:24.505 --> 03:31:26.340
ADVISORS TO ADVISE STUDENTS WE

MAINTAIN THE BUILDINGS IT'S OUR

03:31:30.144 --> 03:31:31.278
IT'S OUR OPERATING FUNDS OF THE

03:31:31.345 --> 03:31:33.414
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. IS THAT

03:31:33.480 --> 03:31:35.783
PORTION OF THE TOTAL IT'S

03:31:35.849 --> 03:31:36.350
ATTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATING

03:31:36.417 --> 03:31:38.152
FUND. AND WITHIN THAT ONE POINT

03:31:38.218 --> 03:31:41.155
FIVE BILLION. WE HAVE

03:31:41.221 --> 03:31:43.524
DESIGNATED IN ONE OF THE ELEVEN

03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:44.591
ACCOUNTS THAT WE DESIGNATE FOR

MILLION FOR ECONOMIC ECONOMIC

03:31:50.364 --> 03:31:52.433
UNCERTAINTY THAT'S A SPECIFIC

03:31:52.499 --> 03:31:53.934
ACCOUNT THAT EACH CAMPUS USES

03:31:54.001 --> 03:31:55.836
ACROSS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE A

03:31:55.903 --> 03:31:56.904
COMMON DEFINITION FOR EACH OF

03:31:56.970 --> 03:31:58.839
THESE ELEVEN ACCOUNTS. AND

03:31:58.906 --> 03:32:01.141
CAMPUSES MAKE DECISIONS AS THE

03:32:01.208 --> 03:32:01.775
CHANCELLOR AND TRUSTEE MAJORITY

03:32:01.842 --> 03:32:04.745
OF IDENTIFIED. TO CONTRIBUTE TO

03:32:04.812 --> 03:32:05.312
THAT RESERVE FOR DESIGNATED

03:32:05.379 --> 03:32:09.049
PURPOSES. GOT IT AND SO THAT'S

03:32:09.116 --> 03:32:12.219
DIRECT AS A DOCTOR. LET ME

03:32:12.286 --> 03:32:14.288
REPHRASE SO I WAS ONE OF THE

03:32:14.354 --> 03:32:15.355
RECOMMENDATIONS NOT A REPORT

03:32:15.422 --> 03:32:17.391
WAS TO SPECIFY HOW THESE FUNDS

03:32:17.458 --> 03:32:20.461
WERE. TO BE IDENTIFIED AND

03:32:20.527 --> 03:32:21.562
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'VE DONE THAT

03:32:21.628 --> 03:32:23.464
WITH THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY

03:32:23.530 --> 03:32:24.031
TO THE POINT OF FOUR HUNDRED

03:32:24.098 --> 03:32:27.868
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOUR

03:32:27.935 --> 03:32:30.471
HUNDRED UP YES IT FOR ECONOMIC

03:32:30.537 --> 03:32:31.138
SPECIFIC THE ECONOMIC

03:32:31.205 --> 03:32:32.806
UNCERTAINTY ECONOMIC OFFICIALLY

03:32:32.873 --> 03:32:33.907
IT'S FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVEN

03:32:33.974 --> 03:32:34.975
MILLION DOLLARS OF FOR ME

03:32:35.042 --> 03:32:37.711
ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

03:32:37.778 --> 03:32:38.312
LOWER LEVEL OF DETAIL SO THERE

03:32:38.378 --> 03:32:42.082
ARE. THERE ARE THREE ACCOUNTS

03:32:42.149 --> 03:32:44.818
WITHIN THE OPERATIONS RESERVE

03:32:44.885 --> 03:32:48.021
SO THE OPERATIONS RESERVE IS

03:32:48.088 --> 03:32:48.655
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION

03:32:48.722 --> 03:32:49.690
IT'S COMPRISED OF THREE

03:32:49.756 --> 03:32:53.560
ACCOUNTS. ONE ACCOUNT FOR

03:32:53.627 --> 03:32:54.661
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ONE FOUR

03:32:54.728 --> 03:32:57.197
SEVEN. WHICH IS FOUR SEVEN ONE

03:32:57.264 --> 03:32:58.799
FOR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT'S

03:32:58.866 --> 03:33:00.467
AN AMOUNT THAT WE RESERVE TO

03:33:00.534 --> 03:33:01.902
PAY SELF INSURED RETENTION. ON

03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:04.972
INSURANCE COVERAGE. AND THERE'S

03:33:05.038 --> 03:33:06.373
AN AMOUNT OF ELEVEN MILLION

03:33:06.440 --> 03:33:08.041
DOLLARS THAT WAS NOT SPECIFIED

03:33:08.108 --> 03:33:09.810
IT'S HELPING ANOTHER ACCOUNT

03:33:09.877 --> 03:33:10.377
BUT IT WAS NOT SPECIFIED FOR

03:33:10.444 --> 03:33:13.914
SPECIFIC PURPOSE. SO THOSE

03:33:13.981 --> 03:33:15.549
THREE COUNTS COMPRISES THE

03:33:15.616 --> 03:33:20.287
GROUP OPERATIONS THERE ARE FIVE

03:33:20.354 --> 03:33:21.655
ACCOUNTS THAT COMPRISE THE

03:33:21.722 --> 03:33:23.790
GROUP SHORT TERM OBLIGATIONS

03:33:23.857 --> 03:33:25.159
AND THERE ARE THREE ACCOUNTS

03:33:25.225 --> 03:33:25.692
THAT COMPRISE THE GROUP OF

03:33:25.759 --> 03:33:28.595
CAPITAL. THOSE LEVEL OF

03:33:28.662 --> 03:33:30.164
ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE AGAIN

03:33:30.230 --> 03:33:31.598
RECORDED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL

03:33:31.665 --> 03:33:33.300
ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES USING

03:33:33.367 --> 03:33:35.702
A COMMON SET OF DEFINITIONS.

03:33:35.769 --> 03:33:37.704
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL WAS OF

03:33:37.771 --> 03:33:38.238
COURSE PROVIDED DURING THE

03:33:38.305 --> 03:33:42.876
AUDIT BUT. THE THREE CATEGORIES

03:33:42.943 --> 03:33:44.545
ENDED UP BEING THE WAY WE

03:33:44.611 --> 03:33:48.682
DESCRIBE IT FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES

03:33:48.749 --> 03:33:49.816
GENERALLY SPEAKING WITHOUT

03:33:49.883 --> 03:33:52.019
GOING THROUGH THE ELEVEN

03:33:52.085 --> 03:33:53.053
ACCOUNTS THAT YOU KNOW THIS

03:33:53.120 --> 03:33:53.687
LONG WINDED EXPLANATION I JUST

03:33:53.754 --> 03:33:56.557
GAVE YOU. CUT IT YEAH AND I'M

03:33:56.623 --> 03:33:57.024
JUST TRYING TO GET THE

03:33:57.090 --> 03:33:59.726
TRANSPARENCY WHERE THAT IS AND.

03:33:59.793 --> 03:34:01.428
WHAT IBM CORRECT IN ASSUMING

03:34:01.495 --> 03:34:02.062
THAT THIS IS NOW ALSO AVAILABLE

03:34:02.129 --> 03:34:05.832
ON THE PORTAL A OF MAY. YES SO

03:34:05.899 --> 03:34:07.401
YES IT'S ABOUT YES IT'S

03:34:07.467 --> 03:34:08.936
AVAILABLE. RIGHT DECISIONAL

03:34:09.002 --> 03:34:11.371
OPTIONS RIGHT NOW

03:34:11.438 --> 03:34:11.972
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY'S LIKE

03:34:12.039 --> 03:34:16.743
EDGING TO GET IN HERE. AND THEN

03:34:16.810 --> 03:34:17.377
WE HAVE SUCH A RAW CONSIDERED A

03:34:17.444 --> 03:34:21.415
MINING. THANK YOU THAT CHANCE

03:34:21.481 --> 03:34:22.349
SO WHAT I HAVE I HAVE TWO

03:34:22.416 --> 03:34:24.418
ISSUES I WANT TO. TO DIG INTO A

03:34:24.484 --> 03:34:25.352
LITTLE BIT WITH YOU LIKE AND

03:34:25.419 --> 03:34:26.787
FRANKLY A LOT MORE OF I THINK

03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:27.354
THESE ARE THE TWO MOST MOST

03:34:27.421 --> 03:34:28.855
PRESSING ISSUES SO DURINGOUR

03:34:28.922 --> 03:34:30.123
ANNUAL BUDGET DISCUSSION WE

03:34:30.190 --> 03:34:32.192
TALK ABOUT THAT THE DESIRES OF

03:34:32.259 --> 03:34:34.828
THE CSU SYSTEM WHICH I'M A

03:34:34.895 --> 03:34:37.764
PRODUCT WHICH I. FULLY SUPPORT.

03:34:37.831 --> 03:34:38.899
IN A FOUR ENGINE FIFTY

03:34:38.966 --> 03:34:39.533
SOMETHING STUDENTS THE STATE OF

03:34:39.600 --> 03:34:41.034
CALIFORNIA. AND SOME OF THOSE

03:34:41.101 --> 03:34:42.869
ARE ONGOING REQUESTS AND ONE

03:34:42.936 --> 03:34:45.205
TIME AND WE'VE DONE A LOT TO

03:34:45.272 --> 03:34:46.607
ADDRESS THOSE SINCE THE-

03:34:46.673 --> 03:34:49.243
RECESSION. SOME OF THOSE ARE

03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:51.612
ONE TIME NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT I

03:34:51.678 --> 03:34:54.147
THINK I WANT TO PUSH BACK A

03:34:54.214 --> 03:34:54.748
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOU SAID IT

03:34:54.815 --> 03:34:55.949
WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO USE

03:34:56.016 --> 03:34:58.418
THESE TO. HIRE MORE STAFF TO

03:34:58.485 --> 03:34:59.686
INCREASE ENROLLMENT USE THESE

03:34:59.753 --> 03:35:01.888
THESE RESOURCES. BUT THERE ARE

03:35:01.955 --> 03:35:03.257
ONE TIME REQUEST THAT WE'RE NOT

03:35:03.323 --> 03:35:05.626
ABLE TO. ALWAYS ADDRESS AND-

03:35:05.692 --> 03:35:06.893
I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS ONE

03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:09.096
POINT FIVE BILLION WAS EVER. ON

03:35:09.162 --> 03:35:10.264
THE TABLE TO BE TALKED ABOUT

03:35:10.330 --> 03:35:13.200
HEY. WE COULD HAVE A- A STATE

03:35:13.267 --> 03:35:15.435
CSU. PARTNERSHIP IN ABOUT

03:35:15.502 --> 03:35:17.170
BANQUET THAT WITH WITH YOU SEE

03:35:17.237 --> 03:35:18.105
IF YOU TIMES YOU KNOW WE PUT

03:35:18.171 --> 03:35:19.840
IN. X. AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR WILL

03:35:19.906 --> 03:35:22.109
PUT X. MONEY MONEY MORE FOR THE

GRAD INITIATIVE. OR DEFERRED

03:35:24.478 --> 03:35:26.613
MAINTENANCE. FOR SOME OF OUR-

03:35:26.680 --> 03:35:28.649
ISSUES THE WEEDS HERE FROM OUR

03:35:28.715 --> 03:35:31.418
STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS. YOU KNOW

03:35:31.485 --> 03:35:34.288
HUNGER. THE FOOD PANTRY SOME OF

THESE ARE ARE ONE TIME

03:35:35.222 --> 03:35:37.524
REQUESTED I THINK THOSE COULD

03:35:37.591 --> 03:35:38.692
COULD COULD POTENTIALLY BE

03:35:38.759 --> 03:35:40.460

STUDENT POPULATION AND THE

03:36:02.783 --> 03:36:10.991
SYSTEM. MANY YEARS AGO CENTER

03:36:11.058 --> 03:36:11.892
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WHEN I

SPEND A DOLLAR ONLY ONE TIME.

03:36:19.333 --> 03:36:21.435
AND IN THERE ARE A LOT OF X.

03:36:21.501 --> 03:36:22.836
DEANS OF FORMER DEAN SUED

03:36:22.903 --> 03:36:23.837
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A DISK

03:36:23.904 --> 03:36:25.539
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ONE TIME

03:36:25.605 --> 03:36:28.008
USE IS AN ONGOING USES. SO WE

03:36:28.075 --> 03:36:29.876
HAVE AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE TO

03:36:29.943 --> 03:36:30.744
TRY NOT TO DO PERMANENT

03:36:30.811 --> 03:36:32.579
INVESTMENT ON TEMPORARY MONEY.

03:36:32.646 --> 03:36:33.046

03:36:36.783 --> 03:36:37.784
IS MISTER WELL JUST POINTED OUT.

03:36:37.851 --> 03:36:42.823
ON OUR. OPERATING DESIGNATED

RESERVES WE ACTUALLY SPECIFY

03:36:45.892 --> 03:36:47.494
WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR IT'S A AN

03:36:47.561 --> 03:36:49.696
EXPENSE ITEM FREE TO THE

03:36:49.763 --> 03:36:50.230
CAMPUSES AND FOR US IN THE

03:36:50.297 --> 03:36:52.833
CENTRAL OFFICE. WHEN WE TALK

03:36:52.899 --> 03:36:54.868
ABOUT GROWING THE STUDENT

03:36:54.935 --> 03:36:57.204
ACCESS FOR THE UNIVERSITY AND

03:36:57.270 --> 03:36:58.138
THE NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER

03:36:58.205 --> 03:36:59.506
OF TENURE TRACK FACULTY WHICH

03:36:59.573 --> 03:37:02.876
IS A BIG ISSUE FOR OUR FACULTY

03:37:02.943 --> 03:37:03.443
IN FOR THE SENATE AND FOR US

03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:06.279
AND FOR THE STATE. HOW WE JUST

03:37:06.346 --> 03:37:08.148
DON'T THINK THAT ONE TIME

03:37:08.215 --> 03:37:09.549
YOU'LL MAKE THOSE KIND OF

03:37:09.616 --> 03:37:11.017
HIRING DECISIONS ON ONE TIME

03:37:11.084 --> 03:37:12.486
MONEY I'M NOT ASKING I'M ASKING

03:37:12.552 --> 03:37:14.921
ABOUT. I COULD BRING YOUR

03:37:14.988 --> 03:37:15.555
BUDGET REQUEST LIST YOU BROUGHT

03:37:15.622 --> 03:37:17.324
US FOR FIVE YEARS IN A ROW. THE

03:37:17.391 --> 03:37:18.658
MAJORITY OF THAT IS ONGOING

03:37:18.725 --> 03:37:21.328
REQUESTS BUT A BIG PART OF THAT

03:37:21.395 --> 03:37:24.064
ARE ONE TIME ASKS OF US THAT

03:37:24.131 --> 03:37:24.831
THE GRANT INITIATIVE THAT WE

03:37:24.898 --> 03:37:27.067
FUNDED. LAST COUPLE YEARS AS IT

03:37:27.134 --> 03:37:28.301
WAS BUT IT WAS ABOUT ONE TIME

03:37:28.368 --> 03:37:29.970
REQUEST FROM THE SYSTEM. WE

03:37:30.036 --> 03:37:31.538
FUNDED SOME ONE TIME EMISSIONS

03:37:31.605 --> 03:37:33.540
AS WELL SO THAT'S THEM LOOKING

03:37:33.607 --> 03:37:35.242
AS FAR AS SOMEONE ONE TIME

03:37:35.308 --> 03:37:36.810
MEASURE MCCARTY ACTUALLY

03:37:36.877 --> 03:37:37.711
GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS NOT

03:37:37.778 --> 03:37:38.979
BEEN ON ONGOING REQUESTS. AND

03:37:39.045 --> 03:37:44.518
EVERY YEAR THAT WE'VE ADDED.

03:37:44.584 --> 03:37:45.152
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO

03:37:45.218 --> 03:37:45.685
IT HAS BEEN ONGOING BASE.

03:37:45.752 --> 03:37:50.157
INCREASES. IN A ONE TIME TO

03:37:50.223 --> 03:37:52.359
RAISE TUITION. AS AN ONGOING

03:37:52.426 --> 03:37:54.194
FUND SOURCE IF. AS LONG AS OUR

03:37:54.261 --> 03:37:55.662
STUDENT POPULATION STAYS UP.

03:37:55.729 --> 03:37:56.196
AND THAT WAS USED ALSO FOR

03:37:56.263 --> 03:37:58.732
GRADUATION INITIATIVE. SO THE

03:37:58.799 --> 03:37:59.299
ONE TIME DOLLARS REALLY ARE

03:37:59.366 --> 03:38:01.435
USED MOSTLY FOR. CAPITAL

03:38:01.501 --> 03:38:03.570
PROJECTS COBBLE TOGETHER MONEY

03:38:03.637 --> 03:38:04.337
TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT ON

03:38:04.404 --> 03:38:05.305
RENOVATING ASSIGNS BUILDING

03:38:05.372 --> 03:38:05.839
IT'S ACTUALLY MAINTENANCE

03:38:05.906 --> 03:38:07.407
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THINGS OF

03:38:07.474 --> 03:38:08.608
THAT NATURE THAT HAVE A SHORT

03:38:08.675 --> 03:38:10.610
TERM HORIZON TO THEM. YOU KNOW

03:38:10.677 --> 03:38:11.812
WE'RE PUTTING IN A NEW THE

03:38:11.878 --> 03:38:12.879
CONSOLIDATED HUMAN RESOURCE

03:38:12.946 --> 03:38:13.980
SYSTEMS EXPENSIVE TO DO OVER

03:38:14.047 --> 03:38:15.849
MULTIPLE YEARS AT A ONE TIME

03:38:15.916 --> 03:38:21.254
EXPENSE TO SET MONEY ASIDE. FOR

03:38:21.321 --> 03:38:21.855
THINGS OF ANY WE DO A UNIFIED

03:38:21.922 --> 03:38:26.026
IT. PROJECTS SO YOU'RE RIGHT

03:38:26.092 --> 03:38:27.127
THOUGH THAT THE STATE HAS GIVEN

03:38:27.194 --> 03:38:27.761
US ONE TIME MONEY FOR ACADEMIC

03:38:27.828 --> 03:38:29.463
THINGS AS WELL AND ONE OF THE

03:38:29.529 --> 03:38:30.630
DIFFICULTIES WE'VE ALWAYS MADE

03:38:30.697 --> 03:38:31.765
THE CASE FOR AS WELL WE'RE

03:38:31.832 --> 03:38:33.767
GRATEFUL FOR WITH AND WE HAVE

03:38:33.834 --> 03:38:35.702
TO REALIZE THAT WE STAFF AT ON

03:38:35.769 --> 03:38:37.337
A TEMPORARY BASIS ON A

03:38:37.404 --> 03:38:38.638
PERMANENT BASIS BECAUSE WE HAVE

03:38:38.705 --> 03:38:40.540
NO ASSURANCE THAT OF THAT

03:38:40.607 --> 03:38:42.909
PROGRAM STUDENTFUNDING STOP SO

03:38:42.976 --> 03:38:43.877
WE CAN CONTINUE IT. SO IT IS

03:38:43.944 --> 03:38:46.746
IT'S A DELICATE COMPLEX MATTER

03:38:46.813 --> 03:38:48.815
FOR US TO MANAGE WELL I DAHLE

03:38:48.882 --> 03:38:50.350
DISAGREE AND WE CAN SIT AND GO

03:38:50.417 --> 03:38:52.452

FIVE YEARS AND WE'VE

03:38:53.453 --> 03:38:56.323
APPROPRIATE PLENTY OF

03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:58.692
ALLOTMENTS OF ONE TIME MONEY

03:38:58.758 --> 03:39:00.193
KNOWING THAT'S NOT STAFFING IS

03:39:00.260 --> 03:39:02.629
TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW MENTAL

03:39:02.696 --> 03:39:04.664
HEALTH PROGRAMS BASIC NEEDS FOR

03:42:47.954 --> 03:42:50.056
STATE BORROWED SEVEN HUNDRED

03:42:50.123 --> 03:42:50.623
MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH FROM

03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:51.391
THE C. ISSUE TO MAKE PAYROLL.

03:42:51.458 --> 03:42:52.258
THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT REFLECTED

03:42:52.325 --> 03:42:54.027
ON THE CHART. IT'S APPROPRIATE

03:42:54.094 --> 03:42:55.662
THAT IS NOT REFLECTED BECAUSE

03:42:55.729 --> 03:42:57.330
IT WAS CASH. THAT WAS MOVED

03:42:57.397 --> 03:42:58.998
FROM THE C. ISSUE TO THE STATE

03:42:59.065 --> 03:43:02.469
TO MAKE PAYROLL. THE STATE HAD

03:43:02.535 --> 03:43:03.203
SAID AT THE TIME AS YOU RECALL

03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:05.071
THAT. IT WAS GONNA BE IS GONNA

03:43:05.138 --> 03:43:06.606
PAY THAT MONEY BACK. SO IT WE

03:43:06.673 --> 03:43:10.577
HAD A RECEIVABLE. SO THAT THAT

03:43:10.643 --> 03:43:12.579
CHARGE IS NOT A MEASURE OF.

03:43:12.645 --> 03:43:14.914
CASH IT'S A MEASURE OF BUDGETED

03:43:14.981 --> 03:43:17.717
RESERVE AND AMOUNT THAT WE

03:43:17.784 --> 03:43:21.087
ANTICIPATE USING AT SOME POINT

03:43:21.154 --> 03:43:21.721
IN THE FUTURE FOR THE KINDS OF

03:43:21.788 --> 03:43:22.222
THINGS THAT YOU'VE BEEN

03:43:22.288 --> 03:43:24.257
DISCUSSING. BUT YOU WOULD THINK

03:43:24.324 --> 03:43:26.459
THAT THE WORST YEAR IF I RECALL

03:43:26.526 --> 03:43:28.461
AND I WAS IN HEARING DOCTOR PAN

03:43:28.528 --> 03:43:29.028
AND THE ONLY ONE WHO WASN'T

03:43:29.095 --> 03:43:32.599
JUST LEFT. HIS THAT THE TEN WAS

03:43:32.665 --> 03:43:34.400
THE WORST YEAR SEE WITH THINK

03:43:34.467 --> 03:43:37.203
THAT YEAR WHEN. YOU SEE THAT

03:43:37.270 --> 03:43:40.140
AMOUNT IN THERE CSU. PIGGY BANK

03:43:40.206 --> 03:43:41.474
TO GO DOWN AND IT IS LIKE IT'S

03:43:41.541 --> 03:43:43.076
A RAINY DAY FUND THERE'S A

03:43:43.143 --> 03:43:45.078
MONSOON OUTSIDE AND SO YOU

03:43:45.145 --> 03:43:46.212
WOULD THINK THAT WOULD GO. NOT

03:43:46.279 --> 03:43:49.315
QUITE ZERO BUT SIGNIFICANTLY.

03:43:49.382 --> 03:43:50.250
DOWN SO THAT'S WHAT MAKES US

03:43:50.316 --> 03:43:51.918
SCRATCH OUR HEAD IS A COURSE IT

03:43:51.985 --> 03:43:54.354
MAY BE LOGICAL TO HAVE THIS

03:43:54.420 --> 03:43:55.855
POLICY FOR THE FUTURE BUT AFTER

03:43:55.922 --> 03:43:56.856
SITTING HERE TODAY SHOULD TO BE

03:43:56.923 --> 03:43:57.857
GREAT THIS. RESERVE GOING

03:43:57.924 --> 03:43:59.359
FORWARD TO PROTECT US AGAINST

03:43:59.425 --> 03:44:01.561
YEAH. BUT YOU GO BACK LOOK AT

03:44:01.628 --> 03:44:03.696
PAST HISTORY LIKE WHEN WE DID

03:44:03.763 --> 03:44:06.232
HAVE A NEED FOR THIS. IT DIDN'T

03:44:06.299 --> 03:44:07.233
QUITE PLAY OUT THAT WAY THAT'S

03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:09.769
WHY I THINK IT GIVES. THAT'S

03:44:09.836 --> 03:44:11.271
GREAT CONCERN COUPLE OF THE

03:44:11.337 --> 03:44:12.806
FACT THAT WE GET LINED UP OUT

03:44:12.872 --> 03:44:14.507
THE DOOR OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

03:44:14.574 --> 03:44:15.575
BUDGET HEARINGS TALK ABOUT.

03:44:15.642 --> 03:44:17.243
PRESSING NEEDS TODAY SELLERS

03:44:17.310 --> 03:44:18.912
THOSE THINGS JUST I THINK

03:44:18.978 --> 03:44:19.746
CREATE A PICTURE FOR US THE

03:44:19.813 --> 03:44:21.447
CRUISE A LOT OF. YEAH COMFORT

03:44:21.514 --> 03:44:22.415
AND WE HAVE TO RECALL THAT THAT

03:44:22.482 --> 03:44:25.151
CHARTER ONLY DEALS WITH A

03:44:25.218 --> 03:44:27.554
PORTION OF THE- RESERVE THAT

03:44:27.620 --> 03:44:30.390
IS. THE AS AS THE STATE

03:44:30.456 --> 03:44:32.592
APPROPRIATION WAS REDUCED. AND

03:44:32.659 --> 03:44:34.127
THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE COLLECTED

03:44:34.194 --> 03:44:36.396
FROM STUDENT TUITION INCREASED

03:44:36.462 --> 03:44:38.698
THAT MONEY BECAME AVAILABLE TO

03:44:38.765 --> 03:44:46.873
US FOR RESERVE. PRIOR. TO THAT.

03:44:46.940 --> 03:44:47.507
THE MONEY WAS HELD IN THE STATE

03:44:47.574 --> 03:44:54.948
TREASURY. WE DIDN'T HOLD.

03:44:55.014 --> 03:44:55.982
BALANCES WE THE BIG THEY

03:44:56.049 --> 03:44:56.983
WOULD'VE READ THEY WOULD HAVE

03:44:57.050 --> 03:44:57.517
BEEN PART OF THE REVERSION

03:44:57.584 --> 03:44:58.785
PROCESS. WHICH AS YOU KNOW

03:44:58.852 --> 03:44:59.385
TAKES THREE YEARS SO WE WERE

03:44:59.452 --> 03:45:00.687
THAT BALANCES. IN THE GENERAL

03:45:00.753 --> 03:45:01.321
FUND THAT WOULD BE RECORDED ON

03:45:01.387 --> 03:45:02.322
THAT ON THAT TABLE. SO THERE'S

03:45:02.388 --> 03:45:03.256
A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN A AND

03:45:03.323 --> 03:45:05.291
PRACTICES THAT OCCURRED AT THE

03:45:05.358 --> 03:45:10.063
SAME TIME THAT IS. TUITION WAS

03:45:10.129 --> 03:45:10.597
INCREASED. COOPERATION WAS

03:45:10.663 --> 03:45:13.032
REDUCED AND THE BALANCE IS

03:45:13.099 --> 03:45:13.633
REPORTED IN A SINGLE FUND HELD

03:45:13.700 --> 03:45:17.503
OUTSIDE THE STATE TREASURY.

03:45:17.570 --> 03:45:21.040
OKAY THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE

03:45:21.107 --> 03:45:21.741

03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:22.475
FIFTEEN AS WELL AND JUST THE

03:45:22.542 --> 03:45:23.376
CHART LOOKS TROUBLING RIGHT

03:45:23.443 --> 03:45:28.248
BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT. YOU

03:45:28.314 --> 03:45:28.715
KNOW WHY I WAS THE CSU

03:45:28.781 --> 03:45:32.118
INCREASING ITS RESERVE DURING

03:45:32.185 --> 03:45:32.952
THE GREAT RECESSION WHEN YOU

03:45:33.019 --> 03:45:33.453

03:45:33.519 --> 03:45:34.053
RESERVE AS OPPOSED INCREASING

03:45:34.120 --> 03:45:36.890
AT. RIGHT AND THAT'S PROBABLY A

03:45:36.956 --> 03:45:37.457
LOT OF THE ANGST OF MISSED

BUDGET IN EACH OF US. AS WE

03:45:43.863 --> 03:45:45.531
WERE VISITED BY MANY STUDENTS

PAYING IT'S SO DIFFICULT AT

03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:05.151
SOME POINTS TO TELL WHAT WE'RE

03:46:05.218 --> 03:46:05.785
DEALING WITH HERE WE TALK ABOUT

03:46:05.852 --> 03:46:08.488
ONE POINT. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

03:46:08.554 --> 03:46:09.489
IN RESERVE I'M NOT AN

03:46:09.555 --> 03:46:10.123
ACCOUNTANT SO I'M CERTAINLY NOT

03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:13.893
AN AUDITOR. BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:46:13.960 --> 03:46:16.062
IT'S A BIT OF SEMANTICS WE TALK

03:46:16.129 --> 03:46:17.730
ABOUT A SURPLUS WE TALK ABOUT A

03:46:17.797 --> 03:46:19.399
RESERVE BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE

03:46:19.465 --> 03:46:21.401

I PERSONALLY AS IT DOES NOT

03:46:33.046 --> 03:46:33.546
HONOR AND NOT AN ACCOUNTANT.

03:46:33.613 --> 03:46:37.183
DON'T CONSIDER. THE ONE HUNDRED

03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.717
MILLION OF THE TWO HUNDRED

03:46:37.784 --> 03:46:40.019
MILLION AS A SURPLUS. AND I

03:46:40.086 --> 03:46:40.586
DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT AS A

03:46:40.653 --> 03:46:44.290
RESERVE. IF YOU'VE SAID IT ALL

03:46:44.357 --> 03:46:46.225
UP THE FIRST YEAR TO BE GONE IF

YOU HOLD IT FOR THREE AND

03:46:47.527 --> 03:46:49.929
SENATE THE THIRD YEAR IT'S GONE

03:46:49.996 --> 03:46:52.198
BUT IT'S NOT THE SURPLUS IS NOT

03:46:52.265 --> 03:46:54.133
RESERVE NOW MAYBE THOSE

03:46:54.200 --> 03:46:56.669
RECOUNTING AN AUDIT TERMS THAT.

03:46:56.736 --> 03:46:57.704
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHICH IS

03:46:57.770 --> 03:47:00.173
QUITE POSSIBLE. BUT I WHAT I

03:47:00.239 --> 03:47:02.008
LIKE TO SEE HERE IS AND I KNOW

03:47:02.075 --> 03:47:03.509
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS IS THAT

03:47:03.576 --> 03:47:06.112
YOU. YOU SEPARATE OUT THOSE

03:47:06.179 --> 03:47:07.814
THINGS THAT WE THROW AROUND

03:47:07.880 --> 03:47:09.282
HERE IS APPARENTLY PART OF THE

03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:11.250
ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WHICH

03:47:11.317 --> 03:47:13.553
ARE CERTAINLY NOT SURPLUS. IN A

03:47:13.619 --> 03:47:15.855
REALLY NOT A RESERVE. AND LET'S

03:47:15.922 --> 03:47:17.590
GET DOWN TO WHAT WE REALLY ARE

03:47:17.657 --> 03:47:18.992
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

03:47:19.058 --> 03:47:21.227
DOLLARS SO THAT. WE CAN DECIDE

03:47:21.294 --> 03:47:23.663
WHETHER REALLY OUTRAGED OR OR

03:47:23.730 --> 03:47:25.765
NOT QUITE AS OUTRAGED BECAUSE

03:47:25.832 --> 03:47:27.266
OF. OF WHAT YOU'RE HOLDING IN

03:47:27.333 --> 03:47:29.002
WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH IT. SO

03:47:29.068 --> 03:47:31.637
THAT'S ONE COMMENT I HAVE AND

03:47:31.704 --> 03:47:35.241
THEN JUST ANOTHER COMMENT. NOT

03:47:35.308 --> 03:47:35.842
TO PUT ANYBODY ON THE SPOT BUT

03:47:35.908 --> 03:47:37.477
IT HAS TO DO WITH PARKING. AND

03:47:37.543 --> 03:47:38.444
I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE IN THE

03:47:38.511 --> 03:47:39.912

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO.

03:47:46.753 --> 03:47:48.955
DRIVE MORE MONEY DOWN TO THE-

03:47:49.022 --> 03:47:51.157
STUDENTS AS PART OF THE PROCESS

03:47:51.224 --> 03:47:52.825
WHETHER IT'S EXPANDING CAL

03:47:52.892 --> 03:47:54.160
GRANTS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

03:47:54.227 --> 03:47:55.495
COMPETITIVE COVERAGE SLOTS OR

03:47:55.561 --> 03:47:58.564

COMMUTER CAMPUSES. OF AT LEAST

03:48:37.036 --> 03:48:37.570
A SIGNIFICANT PART AND SO PER

03:48:37.637 --> 03:48:41.741
KING. THERE IS A MAJOR PART OF

03:48:41.808 --> 03:48:43.476
A STUDENT'S LIFE AND THE COST

SECTION HOUSE WHAT OTHER

03:58:29.828 --> 03:58:31.230
WE INTERPRETED THAT AS ONGOING

03:58:31.296 --> 03:58:33.732
EXPENSES THE UNIVERSITY. IN AS

03:58:33.799 --> 03:58:35.601
A MATTER OF PRACTICE WE DON'T

USE A ONE TIME FUNDS FOR ON

03:58:37.102 --> 03:58:39.471
GOING. SO IS THAT REASON AND

03:58:39.538 --> 03:58:40.939
THAT REASON ONLY WHY WE DIDN'T

BANDS AND WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR

03:58:53.886 --> 03:58:56.088
WHAT THEY CAN'T BE USED FOR. SO

03:58:56.155 --> 03:58:56.655

04:06:26.671 --> 04:06:28.440
REQUIRED TO HAVE A BUDGET

04:06:28.507 --> 04:06:29.608
ADVISORY COMMITTEE BY WHATEVER

04:06:29.674 --> 04:06:31.877
NAME. AND STUDENTS ARE MEMBERS

04:06:31.943 --> 04:06:33.945
OF THAT COMMITTEE AS WELL SO

04:06:34.012 --> 04:06:34.546
THEY HAVE THEIR VOICE AT THE

04:06:34.613 --> 04:06:37.048
TABLE INTERACTING WITH THE-

04:06:37.115 --> 04:06:39.684
CAMPUS PRESIDENT AND THE VICE

04:06:39.751 --> 04:06:40.285
PRESIDENT'S FINANCE EXETER AT

04:06:40.352 --> 04:06:45.056
THAT TIME. YOU PARKING IS SUCH

04:06:45.123 --> 04:06:47.325
A VEXING ISSUE FOR US AND-

04:06:47.392 --> 04:06:49.394
ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND PROBABLY

04:06:49.461 --> 04:06:53.732
WILL BE FOR A WHILE. THE COST

04:06:53.798 --> 04:06:56.067
IS REAL YOU KNOW BY LAW IT HAS

04:06:56.134 --> 04:06:56.801
TO BE A TOUGH ONE ITS OWN

04:06:56.868 --> 04:06:58.570
BOTTOM SO WE CAN'T USE ANY FUND

04:06:58.637 --> 04:06:59.804
OTHER THAN GENERATED FOR

04:06:59.871 --> 04:07:02.407
PARKING FEES ARE FOR. AND FIND

04:07:02.474 --> 04:07:05.877
TAKE CENTER FOR THAT OPERATION.

04:07:05.944 --> 04:07:06.978
THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES PAY

04:07:07.045 --> 04:07:08.980
LESS AND STUDENTS AS A RESULT

04:07:09.047 --> 04:07:10.048
OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OF THE

04:07:10.115 --> 04:07:12.684
PAST. ARE A MAJOR CONTRACTOR

04:07:12.751 --> 04:07:14.886
ALL OPENING UP DURING THIS NEXT

04:07:14.953 --> 04:07:16.154
TWELVE MONTHS SO I THINK YOU

04:07:16.221 --> 04:07:18.490
WILL SEE IN THE COLLECTIVE

04:07:18.557 --> 04:07:18.990
BARGAINING DISCUSSION TO

04:07:19.057 --> 04:07:19.558
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION GOING

04:07:19.624 --> 04:07:24.496
FORWARD. THE AVAILABILITY ISSUE

04:07:24.563 --> 04:07:25.931
IS WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ADDING

04:07:25.997 --> 04:07:27.532
PARKING TO THE CAMPUSES ARE

04:07:27.599 --> 04:07:29.301
MORE COMPUTER MORE COMMUTER

04:07:29.367 --> 04:07:31.870
URGE OTHER THAN THAN OTHERS.

04:07:31.937 --> 04:07:34.372
WE'VE ALSO BEEN ADDING STUDENTS

04:07:34.439 --> 04:07:35.740
FORTY ONE THOUSAND MORE BODIES.

04:07:35.807 --> 04:07:37.275
AND SO WHILE THE NUMBER HAS

04:07:37.342 --> 04:07:40.045
GONE UP TO SORT OF NUMBER TO

04:07:40.111 --> 04:07:41.146
STUDENT RATIOS IS THE AUDITOR

04:07:41.213 --> 04:07:43.582
CORRECTLY POINTS OUT. HAS MOVED

04:07:43.648 --> 04:07:45.217
IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS ON THE

04:07:45.283 --> 04:07:46.017
FOUR CAMPUSES THEY LOOK LOOKED

04:07:46.084 --> 04:07:50.622
AT CAREFULLY COUPLE I GOT A

04:07:50.689 --> 04:07:51.156
LITTLE BETTER IN A COUPLE

04:07:51.223 --> 04:07:54.259
ACTUALLY GOT A LITTLE WORSE. UP.

04:07:54.326 --> 04:07:55.160
I THINK THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF THE

04:07:55.227 --> 04:07:57.329
PARKING GOING FORWARD IS REALLY

04:07:57.395 --> 04:07:57.963
INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT OF

04:07:58.029 --> 04:07:59.264
THOMAS VEHICLES IN THE RIDE

04:07:59.331 --> 04:08:01.533
SHARING SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF

04:08:01.600 --> 04:08:02.500
THIS AND WE THINK ABOUT PARKING

04:08:02.567 --> 04:08:05.937
NEEDS TEN YEARS FROM NOW. WHAT

04:08:06.004 --> 04:08:06.504
OUR STUDENTS TEN YEARS AND I

04:08:06.571 --> 04:08:06.972
CAN BE THINKING ABOUT

04:08:07.038 --> 04:08:09.474
TRANSPORTATION. AND CERTAINLY

04:08:09.541 --> 04:08:11.643
IN THE URBAN AREAS ALTERNATE

04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:12.644
TRANSPORTATION CAN BE DONE MUCH

04:08:12.711 --> 04:08:16.881
FOR ROBUSTLY I THINK THEN

04:08:16.948 --> 04:08:19.050
PERHAPS MORE RURAL CAMPUS WHERE

04:08:19.117 --> 04:08:19.884
THE CITY OR COUNTY

04:08:19.951 --> 04:08:21.987
INFRASTRUCTURES AND SUPPLY. SO

04:08:22.053 --> 04:08:23.255
WE HAVE OUR CANNOT FORCE AND I

04:08:23.321 --> 04:08:23.722
APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS

04:08:23.788 --> 04:08:26.358
COMMENTED TO TAKE MORE DEEPLY

04:08:26.424 --> 04:08:28.426
ON ALTERNATIVE BUT WE'RE ALSO

04:08:28.493 --> 04:08:29.261
GOING THROUGH QUITE A CHANGE IN

04:08:29.327 --> 04:08:30.795
THE WAY OUR STUDENTS IN

04:08:30.862 --> 04:08:32.330
PARTICULAR OF WILL BE THINKING

04:08:32.397 --> 04:08:33.632
ABOUT TRANSPORTATION. AND

04:08:33.698 --> 04:08:35.600
FINALLY ALSO THIS TOTAL COST OF

04:08:35.667 --> 04:08:38.570
ATTENDANCE IS A REAL DILEMMA

04:08:38.637 --> 04:08:40.605
AND CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA

04:08:40.672 --> 04:08:42.641
PARTICULARLY ON MANY OF OUR

04:08:42.707 --> 04:08:43.775
COASTAL COMMUNITIES COASTAL

04:08:43.842 --> 04:08:45.977
CAMPUSES WHERE HE DOESN'T

04:08:46.044 --> 04:08:47.279
REALLY MATTER IT'S MONEY

04:08:47.345 --> 04:08:48.647
WHETHER IT'S TUITION OR WHETHER

04:08:48.713 --> 04:08:50.248
IT'S A HOUSING OR THEIR

04:08:50.315 --> 04:08:51.383
TRANSPORTATION OR PARKING OR

04:08:51.449 --> 04:08:53.051
FOOD OR- WHAT HAVE YOU AS THE

04:08:53.118 --> 04:08:55.654
TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND SO

04:08:55.720 --> 04:08:56.821
SOME OF THE- THINGS THAT HAVE

04:08:56.888 --> 04:08:58.690
BEEN OF. DONE WITH RESPECT TO

04:08:58.757 --> 04:08:59.224
FINANCIAL AID HAVE BEEN

04:08:59.291 --> 04:09:04.629
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE DON'T

04:09:04.696 --> 04:09:09.234
WANT TO RESOURCES FOR. WE DON'T

04:09:09.301 --> 04:09:10.302
WANT THE LACK OF RESOURCES TO

04:09:10.368 --> 04:09:12.404
GET AWAY FOR STUDENTS WHO OFTEN

04:09:12.470 --> 04:09:14.172
LOW INCOME AND OFTEN FIRST JAN.

04:09:14.239 --> 04:09:15.206
TO COME TO THE CSU AND SO WE'VE

04:09:15.273 --> 04:09:17.108
BEEN WORKING HARD ON THAT. IF

04:09:17.175 --> 04:09:17.609
WE CAN FIND A WAY TO GET

04:09:17.676 --> 04:09:21.413
PARKING REVENUES. UP IN ONE

04:09:21.479 --> 04:09:22.013
AREA WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DROP

04:09:22.080 --> 04:09:22.947
THE GUN AND OTHER IT BUT THAT

04:09:23.014 --> 04:09:23.548
IS. A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

04:09:23.615 --> 04:09:24.549
RIGHTS AND I UNDERSTAND YOU

04:09:24.616 --> 04:09:26.284
HAVE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHY

04:09:26.351 --> 04:09:28.253
DIFFERENT. CAPACITIES THAT

04:09:28.320 --> 04:09:32.023
CENTURY. I THINK WE AT ALL NOW

04:09:32.090 --> 04:09:35.427
IS THE TRANSPORTATION. MEANS

04:09:35.493 --> 04:09:35.960
AND MODALITIES IS RAPIDLY

04:09:36.027 --> 04:09:38.663
CHANGING BUT FOR STUDENTS WHO

04:09:38.730 --> 04:09:40.799
ARE THERE TODAY OR FOR THE NEXT

04:09:40.865 --> 04:09:42.067
FOUR YEARS THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE

04:09:42.133 --> 04:09:44.369
TO WAIT FOR THOSE. THOSE LONGER

04:09:44.436 --> 04:09:47.205
TERM CHANGES IN THE REMEDIES

04:09:47.272 --> 04:09:49.474

FOR YEARS THE CSU HASN'T

04:10:07.125 --> 04:10:08.960
ADDRESSED. PARKING IN EQUITIES

04:12:14.118 --> 04:12:15.420
CLEAR THAT THIS HOW THIS

04:12:15.487 --> 04:12:20.258
FUNDING WAS WORKING. I MEAN I'M

04:12:20.325 --> 04:12:22.126
AND THE REASON I ASK IS AS MRS

04:12:22.193 --> 04:12:26.431
PAYING. AS THIS TANK SAID IT'S

04:12:26.498 --> 04:12:29.200
SO HARD TO. WHAT'S GOING ON

04:12:29.267 --> 04:12:31.569
HERE IS LIKE SUCH TWO DIFFERENT

04:12:31.636 --> 04:12:34.706
VERSIONS OF AND IT MAKES IT

04:12:34.772 --> 04:12:38.710
FEEL VERY MYSTERIOUS OF AS TO

04:12:38.776 --> 04:12:41.246
WHAT WAS WHAT WAS SHARED HOW IT

04:12:41.312 --> 04:12:44.816
WAS SHARED HOW TRUTHFUL HEALTH

04:12:44.883 --> 04:12:47.218
MUCH WAS PUT OUT CLEARLY EVERY

04:12:47.285 --> 04:12:48.653
TIME THERE WAS A CONVERSATION

04:12:48.720 --> 04:12:50.121
THAT THAT SHOULD BE A PART OF

04:12:50.188 --> 04:12:52.290
THE CONVERSATION. I'VE SERVED

04:12:52.357 --> 04:12:53.625
ON BOARDS WITH THERE'S LIKE A

04:12:53.691 --> 04:12:55.860
TWO MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET TO

04:12:55.927 --> 04:12:57.562
HUNDREDS A MILLION DOLLARS AND

04:12:57.629 --> 04:12:59.731
NOW TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS

04:12:59.797 --> 04:13:02.066
AND NO BUDGET TO BE SO

04:13:02.133 --> 04:13:05.270
COMPLICATED. THAT THERE'S NOT

04:13:05.336 --> 04:13:07.906
CLARITY IN TERMS OF WHAT'S-

04:13:07.972 --> 04:13:09.607
WHAT FUNDING AS THEY ARE AND

04:13:09.674 --> 04:13:11.109
HOW IT'S BEING SPENT AND WHAT

04:13:11.175 --> 04:13:12.677
FUNDING IS AVAILABLE BECAUSE

04:13:12.744 --> 04:13:15.013
USUALLY WILL NOT EVEN WITH UPS

04:13:15.079 --> 04:13:17.849
AND DOWNS YOU'LL HAVE YOU'LL AT

04:13:17.916 --> 04:13:20.051
SOME POINT SAY WELL I WANT TO

04:13:20.118 --> 04:13:21.753
MOVE THIS FROM THERE TO HERE

04:13:21.819 --> 04:13:24.022
THIS THAT THAT'S USUALLY PART

04:13:24.088 --> 04:13:26.491
OF BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. THAT

04:13:26.558 --> 04:13:31.195
SEEM TO BE LACKEY. AS FAR AS

04:13:31.262 --> 04:13:33.464
CONSIDERATIONS AND OPTIONS THAT

04:13:33.531 --> 04:13:35.767
WERE MADE AVAILABLE WHETHER IT

04:13:35.833 --> 04:13:38.303
WAS STUDENT TUITION INCREASES.

04:13:38.369 --> 04:13:43.308
IT JUST SEEMS SO COMPLETELY.

04:13:43.374 --> 04:13:45.910
STRANGE THAT THEY WOULD BE SUCH

04:13:45.977 --> 04:13:48.980
DIFFERENT VERSIONS SO HI I'M

04:13:49.047 --> 04:13:51.616
GLAD TO HEAR THAT WAS BECAUSE

04:13:51.683 --> 04:13:54.018
IN THE ORGANIZATIONS I SERVED.

04:13:54.085 --> 04:13:56.421
WE ALWAYS HAD IT UP POLICY AND

04:13:56.487 --> 04:13:57.855
EVERY TIME WE DISCUSSED EVERY

04:13:57.922 --> 04:13:59.757
YEAR WE DISCUSS THE BUDGET THAT

04:13:59.824 --> 04:14:01.626
WAS CLEARLY PUT ON THE TABLE DO

04:14:01.693 --> 04:14:04.629
WE GROW WHAT DO WE USE IT WHAT

04:14:08.833 --> 04:14:10.735

04:14:10.802 --> 04:14:13.571

04:14:21.613 --> 04:14:23.715
HOW I'M NOT SAYING DELIBERATE

04:14:23.781 --> 04:14:24.749

FORTH WITH NUMBERS I CAN ONLY

04:15:32.016 --> 04:15:33.151
IMAGINE HOW COMPLICATED IT

04:15:37.789 --> 04:15:39.457

KNOW WHERE THEIR DOLLARS ARE

04:16:00.011 --> 04:16:01.879
GOING. SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S A

04:16:01.946 --> 04:16:03.381
COMMITMENT ALREADY TO IMPROVE

04:16:03.448 --> 04:16:04.682
THAT TRANSPARENCY TOOL WHICH I

04:16:04.749 --> 04:16:07.018
WOULD HIGHLY IN. ENCOURAGING

04:16:07.085 --> 04:16:09.287
RECOMMEND ESPECIALLY. OUT OF

04:16:09.353 --> 04:16:12.423
THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION

04:16:12.490 --> 04:16:12.990
DOLLARS YOU'RE REMOVING FOUR

04:16:13.057 --> 04:16:17.228
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND

04:16:17.295 --> 04:16:17.762
OUT OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED

04:16:17.829 --> 04:16:19.430
MILLION THAT IS TRUE RESERVES.

04:16:19.497 --> 04:16:20.031
YOU HAVE A FOR YOUR STRATEGY

04:16:20.098 --> 04:16:20.665
HORIZON IS WHAT I'M HEARING AS

04:16:20.732 --> 04:16:21.599
WELL. WHAT IS THAT STRATEGY

04:16:21.666 --> 04:16:22.834
HORIZON CONSIST OF AND I THINK

04:16:22.900 --> 04:16:24.969
THAT'S WHERE. THERE NEEDS TO BE

04:16:25.036 --> 04:16:27.972
IT ADDITIONAL DETAILS. SO

04:16:28.039 --> 04:16:29.874
PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT

04:16:29.941 --> 04:16:30.942
IN WHERE THEIR THEIR MONEY IS

04:16:31.008 --> 04:16:33.010
GOING. THIRTY NOT ONLY FOR

04:16:33.077 --> 04:16:34.779
STUDENTS BUT PARENTS I HAVE A-

04:16:34.846 --> 04:16:37.148
A CHILD GOING TO THE CSU VERY

04:16:37.215 --> 04:16:39.250
SOON GOD HELP ME BUT- I'M

04:16:39.317 --> 04:16:40.618
REALLY EXCITED BUT I ALSO WANT

04:16:40.685 --> 04:16:41.586
TO KNOW WHERE MY DOLLARS ARE

04:16:41.652 --> 04:16:50.161
GOING. SECONDLY IN REGARDS TO

04:16:50.228 --> 04:16:54.766
THERE'S SORT OF TWO SORT OF.

04:16:54.832 --> 04:16:55.266
SOURCES OF REVENUE RIGHT

04:16:55.333 --> 04:16:57.668
TUITION AND THEN STUDENT FEES

04:16:57.735 --> 04:16:58.569
AND I KNOW THAT THE JOINT

04:16:58.636 --> 04:17:00.037
LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE

04:17:00.104 --> 04:17:02.039
SOMETIME AGO NOT TOO LONG AGO

04:17:02.106 --> 04:17:03.775
MAYBE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WAS

04:17:03.841 --> 04:17:06.177
LOOKING AT STUDENT FEES AND- I

04:17:06.244 --> 04:17:06.978
JUST THINK THERE IS A

04:17:07.044 --> 04:17:08.246
COMMITMENT TO KIND OF LOOK AT

04:17:08.312 --> 04:17:09.881
THAT BUT IT IS INCONSISTENT IT

04:17:09.947 --> 04:17:11.516
RANGES ANYWHERE FROM A HUNDRED

04:17:11.582 --> 04:17:13.384
AND SEVENTY ONE DOLLARS TO

04:17:13.451 --> 04:17:14.619
EIGHT HUNDRED FOURTEEN DOLLARS.

04:17:14.685 --> 04:17:16.387
SO WE KNOW THAT THOSE FEES

04:17:16.454 --> 04:17:19.090
SOMETIMES ARE ALL ALSO OBSCURE

04:17:19.157 --> 04:17:20.091
AND IT'S INCONSISTENT AS A

04:17:20.158 --> 04:17:22.226
MENTION ACROSS THE CS USE SO I

04:17:22.293 --> 04:17:23.628
JUST THINK THERE'S INCONGRUENCE

04:17:23.694 --> 04:17:25.396
THERE'S A ONE TIME TUITION

04:17:25.463 --> 04:17:27.198
INCREASE INCREASE BUT THEY'RE

04:17:27.265 --> 04:17:28.699
STILL STUDENT SUCCESS FEES THAT

04:17:28.766 --> 04:17:30.501
PEOPLE ARE ARE STILL WONDERING

04:17:30.568 --> 04:17:33.404
ABOUT. SO IS IT INCONGRUENT IN

04:17:33.471 --> 04:17:36.174
MESSAGING OVERALL AND THEN

04:17:36.240 --> 04:17:38.342
LASTLY I'M JUST REALLY HOPEFUL

04:17:38.409 --> 04:17:41.112
FROM THIS PANEL. BOTH FROM THE

04:17:41.179 --> 04:17:44.582
AUDIT IN THE FINDINGS. AND FROM

04:17:44.649 --> 04:17:45.216
THE CHANCELLOR WHITE THAT THERE

04:17:45.283 --> 04:17:45.783
IS A COMMITMENT TO CREATE A

04:17:45.850 --> 04:17:47.385
FIRM RESERVE POLICY WHICH IS

04:17:47.451 --> 04:17:49.587
GREAT. AND TO CREATE ADDITIONAL

04:17:49.654 --> 04:17:51.055
CHECKS AND BALANCES WHICH IS

04:17:51.122 --> 04:17:53.124
WONDERFUL TASK FORCE THAT I

04:17:53.191 --> 04:17:53.925
WOULD HOPE. WHEN INCLUDING YOU

04:17:53.991 --> 04:17:56.060
KNOW THE STUDENT LEADERSHIP.

04:17:56.127 --> 04:17:59.697
BUT IT ALSO HELPS EMPLOYEES.

04:17:59.764 --> 04:18:01.732
PROVIDE THEM WITH A STARTING

04:18:01.799 --> 04:18:03.234
POINT FOR EMPLOYEE NEGOTIATIONS

04:18:03.301 --> 04:18:05.102
SMALL. AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS

04:18:05.169 --> 04:18:06.370
ALL BEEN SAID BUT I KIND OF

04:18:06.437 --> 04:18:07.672
HAVE TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON THIS

04:18:07.738 --> 04:18:08.773
AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK

04:18:08.840 --> 04:18:09.607
EVERYBODY FOR BEING PARTNERS

04:18:09.674 --> 04:18:11.309
AND- I KNOW THAT WERE WERE

04:18:11.375 --> 04:18:13.511
CERTAINLY WATCHING BUT WE ALSO

04:18:13.578 --> 04:18:15.213
ARE VERY. MUCH COLLABORATORS IN

04:18:15.279 --> 04:18:16.447
THIS SENSE AS WELL SO THANKS

04:18:16.514 --> 04:18:19.016
AGAIN. THANK YOU WAS MOVED TO

04:18:19.083 --> 04:18:23.521
ASSEMBLY WOMAN QUIRK SILVA.

04:18:23.588 --> 04:18:24.789
WELL THANK YOU FOR SPENDING I

04:18:24.856 --> 04:18:25.656
THINK THE ENTIRE DAY WAITING

04:18:25.723 --> 04:18:26.691
FOR US TO GET HERE AND THEN

04:18:26.757 --> 04:18:28.893
ALSO THE THREE HOURS OF

04:18:28.960 --> 04:18:31.863
TESTIMONY AND- I DON'T THINK

04:18:31.929 --> 04:18:34.365
ANYBODY LIKES IN ON IT. AND OF

04:18:34.432 --> 04:18:36.701
COURSE OUR LEADER IN ON IT'S

04:18:36.767 --> 04:18:40.238
PROBABLY ISN'T THE POSTER CHILD

04:18:40.304 --> 04:18:41.539
FOR HAVING ALL KINDS OF THANK

04:18:41.606 --> 04:18:43.908
YOU LETTERS CENTER DEPARTMENT.

04:18:43.975 --> 04:18:45.743
BUT IF WE TAKE IT REALLY DOWN

04:18:45.810 --> 04:18:48.646
TO INDIVIDUALS WHICH WE ALL ARE

04:18:48.713 --> 04:18:50.281
AND WE ALL DO OUR TAXES EVERY

04:18:50.348 --> 04:18:52.950
YEAR AND I THINK. MOST OF US

04:18:53.017 --> 04:18:54.619
DON'T STAY UP NIGHTS WORRYING

04:18:54.685 --> 04:18:56.220
ABOUT ALL AUDIT BUT IF SOMEBODY

04:18:56.287 --> 04:18:58.089
WAS TO CALL IN. AND SAY IF

04:18:58.155 --> 04:18:59.857
WE'RE GOING AUDIT YOU FOR YOUR

04:18:59.924 --> 04:19:01.592
INDIVIDUAL TAXES IT WOULD BE A

04:19:01.659 --> 04:19:04.829
LOT OF STRESS. AND I THINK THAT

04:19:04.896 --> 04:19:07.298
AS I'VE NEVER BEEN AUDITED.

04:19:07.365 --> 04:19:08.733
THERE WOULD PROBABLY THINK BE

04:19:08.799 --> 04:19:10.701
THINGS THAT EVEN IN MY OWN

04:19:10.768 --> 04:19:11.769
PAPERWORK THAT I MIGHT HAVE

04:19:11.836 --> 04:19:12.670
SAID OKAY I WISH I WOULD HAVE

04:19:12.737 --> 04:19:13.437
DONE IT THIS WAY I WOULD HAVE

04:19:13.504 --> 04:19:15.239
BEEN MORE CLEAR. SO I THINK

04:19:15.306 --> 04:19:16.741
THAT'S PART OF THE BOTTOM LINE

04:19:16.807 --> 04:19:19.010
IS JUST THE CLARITY. THAT IF

04:19:19.076 --> 04:19:21.412
YOUR AN ACCOUNTANT IN YOUR IN

04:19:21.479 --> 04:19:22.713
THE WEEDS AND THERE'S BEEN A

04:19:22.780 --> 04:19:24.415
LOT OF TALKING ABOUT WAY DEEP

04:19:24.482 --> 04:19:26.050
IN THE BUDGET. THAT'S NOT

04:19:26.117 --> 04:19:27.184
SOMETHING MOST OF US ARE GOING

04:19:27.251 --> 04:19:29.520
TO BE PERUSING THROUGH. AND I

04:19:29.587 --> 04:19:31.822
THINK IT'S JUST. IN THIS.

04:19:31.889 --> 04:19:34.325
CLIMATE OF MOM MORE AND MORE

04:19:34.392 --> 04:19:37.328
TRANSPARENCY JUST HAVING SOME

04:19:37.395 --> 04:19:38.829
CLARITY OF BIG TAKEAWAYS AND SO

04:19:38.896 --> 04:19:41.532
I APPRECIATE. THAT YOU'VE SAID

04:19:41.599 --> 04:19:42.633
YOU'RE GONNA TAKES A OUR

04:19:42.700 --> 04:19:45.169
RECOMMENDATIONS. I DO

04:19:45.236 --> 04:19:48.272
APPRECIATE. THAT YOU KNOW

04:19:48.339 --> 04:19:49.707
THERE'S A LOT OF NUANCES THAT

04:19:49.774 --> 04:19:51.309
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

04:19:51.375 --> 04:19:54.545
REPORTED FOR WHERE DIFFERENT.

04:19:54.612 --> 04:19:56.647
ACCOUNTS WERE BUT THE CLARITY I

04:19:56.714 --> 04:19:58.616
THINK WOULD MAKE IT. MUCH

04:19:58.683 --> 04:20:01.285
EASIER. ONE OF THE REASONS THIS

04:20:01.352 --> 04:20:04.121
CAME UP FOR ME PARTICULARLY. IS

04:20:04.188 --> 04:20:07.391
YOU DO HAVE A ROBUST. LOBBYING

04:20:07.458 --> 04:20:09.427
GROUP COMING FROM ALL OF YOUR

04:20:09.493 --> 04:20:12.897
CALL IT IS MOST OF THE TIME TO

04:20:12.964 --> 04:20:13.931
THE STATE. AND SOMETIMES WE

04:20:13.998 --> 04:20:16.100
HAVE IN THIS US. THREE TIMES IN

04:20:16.167 --> 04:20:22.273
AS- I. STATED THE BEGINNING I

04:20:22.340 --> 04:20:22.773
HAVE CAL STATE FULLERTON

04:20:22.840 --> 04:20:28.379
LITERALLY IF. TWO MINUTES FROM

04:20:28.446 --> 04:20:30.247
MY HOUSE SO WE DO INTERACTIVE

04:20:30.314 --> 04:20:31.282
MEAN EITHER HAVE THE TOWN DOWN

04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.882
RELATIONSHIPS AND YOU HAVE. A

04:20:31.949 --> 04:20:33.851
LOT OF INTER MINGLING SO FOR

04:20:33.918 --> 04:20:36.454
EXAMPLE AT SOME COLLEGES LIKE

04:20:36.520 --> 04:20:37.888
FULLER TEN THERE'S NOT ONLY.

04:20:37.955 --> 04:20:40.524
JOINT USAGES BETWEEN PROPERTIES

04:20:40.591 --> 04:20:42.059
AND ALL PARKING THESE TYPE OF

04:20:42.126 --> 04:20:44.729
THINGS. BUT THERE'S ALSO

04:20:44.795 --> 04:20:45.496
AGREEMENTS MADE BETWEEN THE

04:20:45.563 --> 04:20:49.266
CITY AND THE UNIVERSITIES AND

04:20:49.333 --> 04:20:51.035
SO SOMETIMES THOSE AGREEMENTS

04:20:51.102 --> 04:20:53.270
GO ON AND ON AS YOU KNOW WITH.

04:20:53.337 --> 04:20:55.339
THE STADIUMS AND WHAT THE

04:20:55.406 --> 04:20:57.008
ARBORETUM'S AND ALL THAT I'D

04:20:57.074 --> 04:20:58.009
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT

04:20:58.075 --> 04:21:00.911
ANOTHER TIME. BUT I THE POINT

04:21:00.978 --> 04:21:02.480
OF THIS IS THAT THERE IS A LOT

04:21:02.546 --> 04:21:04.849
OF LONG TERM AGREEMENTS AND

04:21:04.915 --> 04:21:07.952
PEOPLE MOVE. FACULTY MOVES

04:21:08.019 --> 04:21:11.155
PRESIDENT'S MOVE. DIRECTORS

04:21:11.222 --> 04:21:12.890
MOVED AND SOMETIMES THIS

04:21:12.957 --> 04:21:14.792
INFORMATION CAN GET LOST OVER

04:21:14.859 --> 04:21:16.360
THE DECADES SO I THINK THE

04:21:16.427 --> 04:21:18.596
TRANSPARENCY I THINK MAKING

04:21:18.662 --> 04:21:21.132
SURE IT'S NOT JUST THE STUDENTS

04:21:21.198 --> 04:21:22.900
IS NOT JUST THE FACT OF THE

04:21:22.967 --> 04:21:24.668
WHERE THE BARGAINING UNITS BUT

04:21:24.735 --> 04:21:27.171
IT'S ALSO THE PARENTS. BECAUSE

04:21:27.238 --> 04:21:29.607
NOT ALL BUT MANY PARENTS ARE

04:21:29.673 --> 04:21:31.342
STILL DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO

04:21:31.409 --> 04:21:33.511
PLAN AND SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS

04:21:33.577 --> 04:21:35.479
THROUGH COLLEGE SO. IT ISN'T

04:21:35.546 --> 04:21:38.182
JUST THE TUITION. WE ALSO KNOW

04:21:38.249 --> 04:21:40.484
IT'S THE HOUSING THE TEXT BOOKS

04:21:40.551 --> 04:21:42.019
ALL OF THESE OTHER COSTS BUT

04:21:42.086 --> 04:21:44.688
THE STUDENT FEES ARE SURPRISING

04:21:44.755 --> 04:21:47.725
LIKE I SAID. TWO SONS JUST

04:21:47.792 --> 04:21:48.959
GRADUATING IT WASN'T JUST THE

04:21:49.026 --> 04:21:51.395
TUITION IT WAS TO FIND OUT OKAY

04:21:51.462 --> 04:21:52.830
THAT ALONG WITH THE PARKING

04:21:52.897 --> 04:21:55.066
FEES REALLY ALMOST ADDS UP TO

04:21:55.132 --> 04:21:56.867
ANOTHER ALMOST TWO THOUSAND

04:21:56.934 --> 04:21:58.636
DOLLARS. AT CAL STATE FULLERTON

04:21:58.702 --> 04:21:59.703
I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT AT

04:21:59.770 --> 04:22:02.540
DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT

04:22:02.606 --> 04:22:03.107
FOR A BUDGET YOU WANT TO BE

04:22:03.174 --> 04:22:04.942
AWARE OF THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW

04:22:05.009 --> 04:22:06.510
THAT. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF

04:22:06.577 --> 04:22:09.447
EXTRA THINGS WE HAVE TO PLAN

04:22:09.513 --> 04:22:10.548
FOR AND THEN OF COURSE FOR YOUR

04:22:10.614 --> 04:22:12.883
STUDENTS LIKE TO DO. OTHER

04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:14.452
THINGS LIKE JOIN CLUBS AND ALL

04:22:14.518 --> 04:22:15.920
THESE OTHER THINGS THERE AND I

04:22:15.986 --> 04:22:21.292
THINK MOST PARENTS. GET THAT

04:22:21.358 --> 04:22:21.892
PRETTY MUCH ONCE THEY HAVE ONE

04:22:21.959 --> 04:22:27.131
GO THROUGH TO CALL. BUT I THINK

04:22:27.198 --> 04:22:28.799
FOR THE STUDENTS I WOULD SAY. A

04:22:28.866 --> 04:22:30.434
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THING.

04:22:30.501 --> 04:22:31.235
IS TO KNOW THAT WAY AND

04:22:31.302 --> 04:22:32.570
STUDENTS. ASK FOR A STUDENT FEE

04:22:32.636 --> 04:22:34.171
TO BE PLACED ON A AS A VOTE ON

04:22:34.238 --> 04:22:35.372
THEIR CAMPUS. THAT IT ISN'T

04:22:35.439 --> 04:22:36.740
JUST THE STUDENTS THAT ARE

04:22:36.807 --> 04:22:38.342
GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE ONE OR

04:22:38.409 --> 04:22:40.111
TWO YEARS THAT THERE MAY BE

04:22:40.177 --> 04:22:42.012
STUDENTS PAIN FOR A DECADE OR

04:22:42.079 --> 04:22:43.481
LONGER AND FOR SOME OF THE

04:22:43.547 --> 04:22:46.150
STUDENTS. THAT PLACE THAT THEY

04:22:46.217 --> 04:22:48.853
MAY HAVE ONE YEAR. OF IN JOIN

04:22:48.919 --> 04:22:51.122
LIKE THE TITANS CENTER THAT WAS

04:22:51.188 --> 04:22:51.722
JUST BUILT I THINK IT'S CALLED

04:22:51.789 --> 04:22:55.025
THAT. THE STUDENTS WHO PLACE

04:22:55.092 --> 04:22:57.394
THAT AND ADDED THAT FEE NOW

04:22:57.461 --> 04:22:58.829
EVERY STUDENT WHO COMES IN IS

04:22:58.896 --> 04:23:00.097
PAYING FOR THAT AND SO AS

04:23:00.164 --> 04:23:03.000
PARENTS. SO I'M NOT A SUPER

04:23:03.067 --> 04:23:05.069
SUPER FAN OF STUDENT FEES JUST

04:23:05.136 --> 04:23:05.636
BECAUSE THE STUDENTS DON'T

04:23:05.703 --> 04:23:08.205
ALWAYS REALIZE PLACING THAT FEE

04:23:08.272 --> 04:23:10.307
FOR ANOTHER DECADE OF STUDENTS

04:23:10.374 --> 04:23:11.742
AND SOMETIMES A VOTING TURNED

04:23:11.809 --> 04:23:14.078
OUT OF THAT SEE IS SO SMALL.

04:23:14.145 --> 04:23:15.112
IT'S LIKE OUR ELECTIONS WERE WE

04:23:15.179 --> 04:23:17.014
ONLY GET A SMALL ELECTION NOW

04:23:17.081 --> 04:23:18.315
FOR THE BONDS AND ALL THIS

04:23:18.382 --> 04:23:19.750
STUFF SO THAT'S A REAL BIG

04:23:19.817 --> 04:23:21.785
GLOBAL CONVERSATIONS ALL STOP

04:23:21.852 --> 04:23:23.621
WITH THAT BUT FEES ARE REALLY.

04:23:23.687 --> 04:23:25.389
THEY COST MONEY BOTTOM LINE

04:23:25.456 --> 04:23:27.458
SOMEBODY'S PAIN FOR THOSE AND

04:23:27.525 --> 04:23:28.859

CELEBRITY ON A TOPIC BUT- WE

04:29:09.299 --> 04:29:10.067
WILL NOT MAKE COMMITMENTS THAT

04:29:10.133 --> 04:29:11.368
WE DON'T FEEL WE HAVE THE

04:29:11.435 --> 04:29:14.371
RESOURCES OVER TIME TO PAY FOR

04:29:14.438 --> 04:29:14.938

STUDENTS. WE HAD TO MAKE

04:29:21.478 --> 04:29:22.012
CERTAIN THAT WE'RE GOING TO

THAT'S BOTH THE STUDENT IS

04:29:27.150 --> 04:29:29.019
GOING TO BE HERE AND SO WE DO

04:29:29.086 --> 04:29:30.387
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A LONG TERM

04:29:30.454 --> 04:29:31.488
HORIZON WHEN IT COMES TO

04:29:31.555 --> 04:29:33.056
SERVING OUR STUDENTS. AND

MOVE TO MORE OF A MULTI YEAR

04:35:41.892 --> 04:35:42.792
FUNDING AGREEMENT. THE STATE

04:35:42.859 --> 04:35:43.760
FOR A- THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A

04:35:43.827 --> 04:35:45.195
HUGE STEP FORWARD RATHER THIS

04:35:45.262 --> 04:35:46.329
ANNUAL PROCESS OF. AND NOT

04:35:46.396 --> 04:35:48.098

RIGHT. SO I THINK THERE IS

04:35:50.567 --> 04:35:55.505

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN THE

04:35:58.775 --> 04:36:01.211
PAST WHERE CAN WE SOMEHOW

TO BE MULTI YEAR. TO TRY AND

04:36:06.650 --> 04:36:07.684
GET RID OF THIS INEVITABLE AT

04:36:07.751 --> 04:36:10.020
THE FLOOR. IT'S A HARD THING TO

04:36:10.086 --> 04:36:11.855
DO AN ANNUAL BUDGETING PROCESS

04:36:11.922 --> 04:36:13.623

04:36:15.225 --> 04:36:17.427
ON THE CAMPUSES IN THIS HUGE

04:36:17.494 --> 04:36:17.994
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

04:36:18.061 --> 04:36:20.563
SYSTEM BECAUSE EVERY JANUARY WE

04:36:20.630 --> 04:36:21.631

04:36:21.698 --> 04:36:22.832

04:36:22.899 --> 04:36:24.401
WE BEGIN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

04:36:29.406 --> 04:36:31.975
RILED UP BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

04:36:32.042 --> 04:36:33.410
A MULTI YEAR APPROACH TO THE

04:36:33.476 --> 04:36:37.714
SYSTEM. AND THAT MAKES IT VERY

04:36:37.781 --> 04:36:38.315
UNSUSTAINABLE FINANCIALLY LONG

04:36:38.381 --> 04:36:43.553
