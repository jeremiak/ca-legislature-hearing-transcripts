INDIVIDUALS BY MANDATING THAT THE EDG CONDUCT CROSS MATCHING IT WITH CDC OUR RECORDS BUT ONLY WITHIN NINETY DAYS THIS IS A STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION AND TO BE BRIEF THERE'S OPPOSITION THAT SAYS- THE BILL INTENT IS TO GO AFTER INMATES AND THAT'S JUST SO FAR FROM THE TRUTH. THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT INMATES AS WELL AS SOMEONE'S USING AN INMATE'S- SO SECURITY NUMBER TO OBTAIN BENEFITS THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THAT TO BE CORRECTED AS WELL AN INMATE TO BE ABLE TO STILL PURSUE BENEFITS AFTER THEY LEFT INCARCERATIONS I'M GONNA BE VERY BRIEF INTRODUCED- AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM KERN COUNTY WILL MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MISTER CHAIR AND I HOPE THAT WAS.

GO AHEAD GO HELLO OKAY A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRPERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S CINDY ZIMMER AND I'M THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF KERN COUNTY AND I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB THIRTY NINE A KERN COUNTY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY EDT FRAUD BECAUSE OUR COUNTY HAS BY STATE PRISONS. MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA AND DURING A TIME IN WHICH WE SEEN OUR CRIME RATES CRIED ROCKET INCLUDING- HOMICIDES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN DIVERTED. TO THE PROSECUTION AND INVESTIGATION AT EDT FRAUD- THAT HAVE OCCURRED NOT ONLY IN OUR PRISONS IN OUR JAILS BUT OUT ON OUR STREETS AS WELL AND FOR THE LAW TO TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATED WITH EDT FRAUD CONTINUES TO CLIMB WE CONTINUE TO GET NEW CASES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IS ESTIMATED TO BE THE LOSS OF TO CALIFORNIANS AND AN UNMOLESTED CROSS MATCHING REQUIREMENTS LIKE THOSE PROPOSED HERE IMPLEMENTED CALIFORNIA REALLY DOES CHRIS MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES THAT LEFT IT OPEN TO BE PICK POCKETED BY CRIMINALS ON THIS UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. ONLY REALLY CLEAR THOUGH THIS BILL DOES NOT INCREASE CRIMINAL. PALIN PENALTY FOR THOSE INVOLVED. AND THE BILL IS TO- THAT THE CROSS MATCHING REQUIREMENT IS PROPOSED TO PREVENT THE FRAUD FROM OCCURRING AT ALL. AND BY SHOWING THAT THE NAMED APPLICANTS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE INVOLVED IN THE SCHEME IS IN STATE PRISON AND NOT INDICT TITLE TO BENEFITS. IT REALLY CAN ACTUALLY WORK TO PROTECT AN INMATE FROM BEING A VICTIM OF IDENTITY FRAUD. BECAUSE IF THE VICTIMS IF THE INMATES IDENTITY IS USED WITHOUT THE INMATES KNOWLEDGE HE TOO WAS A VICTIM. BUT COSTS MATCHING CAN ACTUALLY PROTECT THE INMATE AS WELL BECAUSE IF HE DOES COM UNDERSTAND SO HERE SHE COME UNDER SOME SORT OF CLOUD- IT COULD REALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE AND MADE IN THE FUTURE. WHEN IT COMES TO PAROLE OR WHEN HE GETS OUT ON THE STREET- SO CROSS MATCHING REALLY DOES PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND IT PROTECTS THE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL. AS FIDUCIARIES OF THE PUBLIC TRUST WE OWE A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE PROTECTED FROM ABUSE AND FRAUD. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ZIMMER.

GO AHEAD SENATOR DRAWS ON YOUR NEXT BILL. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF SB SEVEN HUNDRED- I'M PROPOSING SB SEVEN HUNDRED TO ENSURE THAT MISCLASSIFIED PORT DRIVERS HAVE ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS AS WE BELIEVE THEY ARE ENTITLED TO. AS A LABOR LEADER I SAW FIRSTHAND THE IMPORTANCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS TO FAMILIES WHEN A PARENT LOST THEIR JOB. THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN KEEP THEIR HOME AND KEEP FOOD ON THE TABLE. FOR PUT PORT TRUCK DRIVERS EVEN THIS MODEST PROTECTION HAS BEEN DENIED. AS THE PANDEMIC HIT THE AMOUNT OF CARGO IN THE PORTS DROP MANY DRIVERS FOUND THEMSELVES OUT OF WORK. WHEN THEY APPLY FOR BENEFITS THEY WERE DENIED EVEN WORSE SO MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS WERE DEEMED TO BE EMPLOYERS OF OTHER DRIVERS. MAKING THEM LIABLE FOR UNPAID YOU I TAXES. NOW WE KNOW THAT COMPANIES USE- MANY WAYS TO MISS CLASS OF BY WORKERS ESPECIALLY IN POOR DRAINAGE. THE LABEL WORKERS A SEPARATE BUSINESSES LEASE THEM TRUCKS AND TELL THEM TO FIND OTHER WORKERS TO DRIVE- OTHER SHIPS. THE EDT DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE ARE BEING OVERTURNED ON APPEAL. BUT WORKERS SHOULD NOT WAIT THEIR VERY SURVIVAL. DEPENDS ON TIMELY ACCESS TO BENEFITS WHEN WORK DRIES UP. THAT'S WHY MY BILL SB SEVEN HUNDRED DIRECTS EDT TO FOLLOW THE LAW. DIREXION TO COMPLY WITH TWO KEY DECISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD. THAT RIGHTFULLY FOUND DRIVERS TO BE EMPLOYEES AND THE TRUCK TRUCKING COMPANY. ARE NOT TO BE THE EMPLOYER MUST PAY THE TAXES. WE MUST ENSURE PORT TRUCK DRIVERS GET FOR ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS THAT THEY HAVE EARNED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS I HAVE TWO WITNESSES CAITLIN VEGA AND SHANE GUSMAN. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND TO SUPPORT THE BILL THE BILL HAS THE CHAIRS SUPPORT. AND- LET'S GO RIGHT TO THE PHONES WILL ALSO GIVE AFTER THE PHONE WILL GIVE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM OR IN ROOM ONE TWENTY FIVE AN WE'RE GOING TO THE PHONES RIGHT NOW WITH SUPPORT WITNESSES.

THIS BILL IS ABOUT ANOTHER GROUP THAT IT WAS HURT BY SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE EDT AND NOT SUPPORT TRUCK DRIVERS. WHO HAVE HAD BENEFITS TONIGHT CAN. KNOW WHERE HAD MATH CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BEEN MORE PERVASIVE THAN AT THE PORT. AND COURTS AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE CONTINUALLY FOUND THESE WORKERS TO BE EMPLOYEES INCLUDING IN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY CASES. BROUGHT BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR COMMISSIONER. ADAM PLEASE THESE DRIVERS ARE CLEARLY ENTITLED TO UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND GET THE EDT HAVE CONTINUED TO DELAY AND DENY THEIR APPLICATIONS- WE HAVE DRIVERS WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED BENEFITS WE HAVE DRIVERS WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING. EMPLOYERS OF ONE ANOTHER AND- EVEN HAD THE EDT PURSUE THESE NEXT CLASSIFIED DRIVERS. FOR BACK WAGES AT BACK ON TAXES AS THOUGH THEY WERE EMPLOYERS WHEN REALLY THESE ARE THE WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN- EXPLAINED IT. AT ALL OF THESE CASES EDT DECISIONS ARE BEING OVERTURNED SO THEY GET OVERTURNED BY THE ALJ WHEN THEY GET OVERTURNED A DELIGHT APPEALS BOARD. AND YET THE EDT REFUSES TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY ARE MAKING THESE DECISIONS- AND ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW. THIS IS A SIMPLE DEL THE BILL BECAUSE EIGHTY TO FOLLOW THE LAW. IT'S BEEN CLEARLY LAID OUT IN THE QUEUE REFERENCED- CASES BY THE UAE APPEAL YOU AYE APPEALS BOARD- IT BATTED CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT. THAT HAVE ALREADY. EDT DETERMINATION. SO THAT'S ALL WE. ASK FOR THAT DRIVERS WHO NEED INTO- BENEFITS HAVE ACT TO THAT AND THAT WOULD CLASSIFY TRY WHO HAVE ALL- ABUSED GAL AND- AND THEN TAKE.

YES SIR YES THIS YEAR GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- THIS IS TAKING SHELTER SHAGARI ENTRY SMELTER AND LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION AND PRISM PUBLIC RISK INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MADE BY CA JOB ON THE BROAD POLICY CONTAINED IN SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR I WOULD LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY FOCUS THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION ON PAGES THREE AND FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH DISCUSS THE PRIOR LEGISLATION SB FIVE FORTY TWO- AND THE LACK OF DATA SPRINKLING SUPPORTING THIS PARTICULAR BILL. FOR THE BOTTOM OF PAGE THREE- THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THE STANDARD FOR ESTABLISHING THE NEED FOR A NEW PRESUMPTION WE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT STANDARD- THAT ESSENTIALLY HOLDS ONE- THAT A NEW PRESUMPTION SHOULD ONLY BE EXTENDED WHEN THERE IS A TYPE OF INJURY THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH FOR CONFIRMATION- INTO THAT THERE'S DATA SHOWING THAT THAT TYPE OF INJURY IS BEING DENIED BECAUSE OF THE HARDSHIP WE THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT TEST I WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASSERT THAT THE PROPONENTS OF SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR IF NOT PROVIDED ANY KIND OF OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD MEET THAT STANDARD. THE PRIOR BILL SB FIVE FORTY TWO ALSO HAD NO OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD MEET THE STANDARDS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT BILL WAS MOVED FORWARD BUT WAS HEAVILY AMENDED IN THIS COMMITTEE- INTACT IT INCLUDES- AT SUNSET- IN THE CHAIR REQUESTED AN ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMISSION THAT WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE BASIS UPON WHICH TO CONSIDER THE EXTENSION OF THAT PARTICULAR SUNSET THAT RESEARCH IS NOT YET AVAILABLE TO THE COMMITTEE THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY EMPLOYERS AND WHILE IT MIGHT SPEAK TO THE NEED TO OR NOT- FOR THE FOR SB FIVE FORTY TWO AND THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT IT WILL SPEAK TO THE VAST EXPANSION THAT'S ANTICIPATED BY S. B. TWO EIGHTY FOUR. THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING RIGHT NOW WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR SHOULD BE A TO YOUR BILL IT'S BEING ADVANCE WITHOUT ANY SORT OF EVIDENCE THE COMMITTEES ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO EVALUATE THE VALIDITY OF THE PRIOR BILL IT CAN'T BE CLAIMS THAT WERE IN A HURRY TO FIX SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OR DATA TO SUGGEST THAT FACT- SO.
