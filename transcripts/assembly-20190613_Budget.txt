THANK YOU COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THE SERVER NOT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WE ARE FUNDING K. TWELVE EDUCATION ADJUST THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IS THAT CORRECT. FOR THIS BUDGET YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY WELL I MEAN I YOU KNOW I'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE BUT I CONTINUE TO BE OF THE OPINION THAT PROP. NINETY EIGHT WAS INTENDED TO BE A FLOOR NOT A CEILING AND VERY HOPEFUL THAT IN FUTURE YEARS WE CAN START. OF FUNDING OVER THE GUARANTEED TO TRY AND GET -- OUR FUNDING REACHES BACK TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. OKAY -- WITH THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE COMMUNIST BE [inaudible] SEVENTY SIX OKAY SEEING NONE WE WILL MOVE ON TO SB SEVENTY SEVEN HIGHER EDUCATION. SIR SB SEVENTY SEVEN INCLUDES A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS RELATED TO HIGHER EDUCATION I WILL JUST MENTION FOR THAT. FIRST IS THE INCLUSION OF CALIBRATED FOR STUDENT PARENTS OF THESE OUR STUDENTS -- ENROLLED IN OUR OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHO ALSO HAVE A DEPENDENT CHILD OR CHILDREN AND INCLUDES CAL GRANTS WITH THE WORD VALUES OF UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. SECOND I HAVE A NOTE IN THIS TRAILER BILL IS A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS OVER 50%. GOING FROM 250-007-0050 TO ABOUT FORTY ONE THOUSAND CAL GRANTS -- UNDER THIS AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS THAT IS UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR RESIDENT TUITION WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE CAL GRANTS THERE'S ALSO FOR THESE AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS A CAL GRANT THE SERVICE CENTER GRANT PROGRAM. THIRD ITEM OF NOTE IS A SECOND YEAR OF FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TUITION FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME STUDENTS. AND FINALLY -- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR UNDER THE BUDGET FOR THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS -- GRANT PROGRAM IN THIS TRAILER BILL ESTABLISHES HOW THAT PROGRAM OF WORK. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. COMMENTS. MR OBERNOLTE. SO WE HAD A DISCUSSION ON THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE MONEY ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT -- AT THE AYE ILLUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT NONE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MY DISTRICT. CURRENTLY CAN OFFER FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO MY CONSTITUENTS SO WHERE ARE WE WITH THAT. YES SO I LOOKED INTO THAT BROUGH WE LOOKED INTO THAT BRIEFLY AND I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE BUT THE THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT -- THE FUNDING FOR FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS CONTINGENT ON THOSE SCHOOLS ACCEPTING -- FEDERAL STUDENT AID AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT BUT I'LL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS. CERTAINLY -- SO ALL THE CULTURES THROUGHOUT THE STATE CAN PARTICIPATE -- THERE ARE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO MEET SUCH AS THE FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAMS WE WORK WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO IS ACTUALLY WORKED WITH -- COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO HELP STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR COHORT DEFAULT RATES A STABLE THIS IS GENERALLY DONE BY. INSURANCE STUDENTS ARE IN THE THE PASSED OUT LOAN REPAYMENT PLANS OFTEN THOSE ARE INCOME BASED A REPAYMENT PLANS. SO ARE FURTHER UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LESS THAN 2% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS STATEWIDE HAPPENED ROLE LOANS -- SO WE WE KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS A CONCERN IN. A SMALL NUMBER OF COLLEGES IN THE STATE HOWEVER WE THINK THAT -- THE EXISTING PROGRAM INSURES THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE GREATEST FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE TO THEM THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- AND WE KNOW THAT THE CHANCES OFFICE IS MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH THOSE DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR ALL FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAMS. AND HAVE DEFAULT RATES THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE BELOW -- ANY THAT WOULD TRIGGER SANCTIONS. WELL I I HAD A DISCUSSION WITH THE CHANCELLOR OF THE LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN MY DISTRICT AND THE REASON WHY THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE IS THAT THERE DEFAULT RATE. WAS OVER 34% IN THE LAST YEAR THEY DID PARTICIPATE SO THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO TIE. THIS FUNDING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOR ALL -- TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE FEDERAL LOANS BECAUSE THAT THAT RESULTS IN MY CONSTITUENTS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO IT. THANK YOU MISS. FOR I JUST TO FOLLOW UP IF YOU CAN CLARIFY DID YOU SEE THAT LESSON. 22% OF THE STUDENTS IN COMMITTEE COLLEGE -- UTILIZE FEDERAL LOANS. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON DATA THAT IS RECEIVED FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THEN IF THE GOAL OF THE FUNDING IS TO ENSURE MORE THAT STUDENTS -- PARTICIPATE IN AND ROLLING COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND I HAVE -- COMMITTEE COLLEGES ALSO OR DON'T THE FALL INTO THE SAME CATEGORY -- AS WAS OBERNOLTE AND IS THE WHY WOULD WE HAVE THAT CRITERIA. I THINK IT GOES TO THAT POINT OF ENSURING THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE GREATEST -- ABILITY -- TO PARTICIPATE IN FINANCIAL AID OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE INCLUDING FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAMS. BUT IF IF -- IF FUNDING IS PROVIDED BY THE STATE TO COVER THE ENROLLMENT COSTS WOULD AND THE WIND WE ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THEM TO TAKE OUT MORE STUDENT LOANS. IT WOULD CERTAINLY REDUCE THEIR NEED TO TAKE OUT CERTAIN TYPES OF STUDENT LOANS BUT THAT'S WERE. WE'VE HAD A CONSISTENT CONVERSATION -- STUDENT -- COSTS BY GO BEYOND JUST THOSE SO TUITION. OKAY THANK YOU. IN THIS REGARD THIS MCCARTY YET THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO ON THIS -- COMMUNICATE AS FREE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ISSUE -- I CONCUR THAT YOU HAVE RAISE AN ISSUE -- TO TAKE A STEP BACK LAST YEAR WHEN WE CREATED THE BILL SANTIAGO AT YOU MCCARTY BILL THIS CLAUSE WAS IN THERE AND IT WAS INSISTED UPON BY THE CHANCES OPTICS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL STUDENTS WERE DRAWING DOWN FINANCIAL AID THEY'RE ALL APPLYING. FOR THE FAST SAID IT MAKES THEIR PELL GRANT ELIGIBLE AND SO FORTH -- THEY MAY NOT BE 100% ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND I AGREE WITH THAT THERE THERE'S ANOTHER -- FOR A PROPOSAL GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THIS YEAR AND AS A FOLLOW UP BILL. AND SO ON I'M COMMITTED TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE TO TRY TO SEE WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE ALL COLLEGES CAN ACCESS. THIS -- FREE COMMITTEE CALL SUCCESS MONEY I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MCCARTY. THANK YOU COULD BE CORAL. TING HERE OBERNOLTE [inaudible] ARAMBULA [inaudible] BLOOM [inaudible] BRO. CHIU. COOPER FONG. FRAZIER [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] GARCIA. JONES SAWYER. LACKEY.

THANK YOU NICK -- QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SINGLE QUESTIONS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. SINGLE PUBLIC COMMENT WAS MOVED SB. EIGHTY TWO SO SB EIGHTY TWO REGARD TO NUMBER OF ITEMS ON GENERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES I WILL BRIEFLY MENTION FIVE OF THEM. A FIRST ARE CHANGES TO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE -- BEFORE WE HAD FOR THE SAKE YOU NEVER SERVE SPECIFIC SUB ACCOUNTS FOR MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS NOW WE SIMPLY HAVE A BROADER SAFETY NET RESERVE AND ARE INCREASING IT FOR THIS BUDGET PROCESS OF EVERYTHING IS ENACTED. FROM TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT 201-820-1929 HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO IN OVER FOUR FOLD INCREASE SECOND IN THIS TRAILER BILL IS THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION AND I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IN COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS THE DIGITAL INNOVATION SERVICES REVOLVING FUND. THIRD ITEM IS SUPPORT TO COUNTIES -- TO UPDATE THEIR VOTING SYSTEMS IN ADVANCE OF WHAT WILL BE A PRETTY BIG -- STATE AND FEDERAL ELECTION IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION CYCLE FOURTH IS THAT DISPOSITION OF THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY AND THE TRAILER BILL EXPLAINS HOW THE PROCESS WILL WORK FOR THAT. AND FIFTY SOME CHANGES REGARDING -- THE A. B. C. -- COMMISSION FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE IN CONTROL -- SO HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON THAT OR ANY OF THE OTHER ITEMS IN THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE COMING FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE NUMBER THIRTEEN OF THIS ITEM -- PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES THE THIRTY DO INTERNET GRIMACE OF THE USERS. OR THE USE ON THE USE OF CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY INCLUDING THE SILL PROPERTY IF. CERTAIN CONDITIONS CAN BE MET CAN WE CLARIFY WHAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS BE MET MEANS. YES I SHOULD TURN IT OVER TO A COLLEAGUE WHO'S WE HAVE THAT IN WRITING IS DELIVERED TO MY OFFICE WITH THOSE CONDITIONS WOULD BE PLACE. SINCE WE'RE HERE WE MIGHT AS WELL. SO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT -- I THINK I WOULD HAVE -- WRITTEN. BUT ESSENTIALLY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SETS OUT AN ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF CINEMA IN THE STATE REGARDING THE DISPOSITION OF THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WHICH WAS CLOSED IN DECEMBER. OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT SPECIFIES THAT THE COUNTY IS GOING BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR EXPEDITING IT'S LAND USE PLANNING PROCESS IN ORDER TO REZONE THE AREA BECAUSE IT IS A VERY. LOCALLY SENSITIVE -- SITE IT INCLUDES A CEMETERY ON SITE FOR THE TOWN OF ELDRIDGE PROVIDES ACCESS TO TWO REGIONAL PARKS -- WEDNESDAY PARKING ONE REGIONAL PARK AND ALSO AS RIPARIAN WATER RATES ON SITE. AND SO IT IT THE RAIN IT BASICALLY. STATES THAT THE COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RE PLANNING A AN EXPEDITED FASHION AND THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SITE. UNTIL IT CAN BE DISPOSED OF THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER WILSON. FOLLOWING UP ON THE ASSEMBLY PLANTS QUESTION I KNOW THAT THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY HAS OPINED THAT THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THAT PROPERTY SHOULD BE -- SHOULD BE DEDICATED TOWARDS THAT COMMUNITY AND I DIDN'T HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT ANY ANYCOMMITMENT. TO TO THAT SO FAR WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. WHAT THE PROCEEDS WILL BE USED? FOR MY CURRENT UNDERSTANDING IS THAT ANY PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE THE PROPERTY WOULD BE RETURNED TO THE GENERAL FUND THE GENERAL FUND CORRECT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WISH TO COMMENT. OKAY SEE NUMBER GONNA MOVE TO SB EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU. SB EIGHTY THREE MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN THE TRAILER BILL OR RELATED TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT. FIRST IS THE EXTENSION OF PAID FAMILY LEAVE DURATION FROM SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS BEGINNING JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED IN PART THROUGH DROPPING THE RESERVE REQUIREMENT IN THE RELATED FIND. FROM 45% AT 30% A SECOND MAJOR CHANGES IN THIS BILL IS THE PAYROLL DEFERRAL BRINGING IT BACK THIS OF COURSE AS WE KNOW WAS DONE DURING A TIME OF FISCAL STRESS FOR THE STATE. AND WHEN PAYMENTS AT THAT TIME WERE TO WAIT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FROM JUNE THIRTIETH TO JULY FIRST -- THIS WILL BRING IT BACK TO JUNE THIRTIETH SO AS PART OF PAYING OFF THE WALL JACK WHICH THE GOVERNOR HAS COMMITTED. TO A AND THEN THE THIRD ARE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES TO CAL SAVERS FORMERLY KNOWN AS SECURE CHOICE. THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS RESTAURANT. SO WE HAVE A ROBUST DISCUSSION ON THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ISSUE YEAH BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND I JUST WONDERED IF YOU HAD A HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DOUBLE CHECK THE MAP THAT WE'VE GONE OVER. ABOUT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO COST THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THEY THE PAYROLL TAX ON THEIR PAYCHECK. YES SIR WE DID LOOK INTO IT AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT AS WELL BUT WE ARE NOT ANTICIPATING ANY CHANGE IN THE DEDUCTION IN THE BUDGET YEAR -- SO IT ALL DEPENDS THESE ARE ALL ESTIMATES IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE TAKE UP TO LEAVE AND FOR HOW LONG WHETHER THEY TAKE THE FULL EIGHT WEEKS -- BUT FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING A CHANGE. HI DANIEL BRAND OF A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATINGAN INCREASE IN THE FOLLOWING A YEAR AS WELL THE FIRST INCREASE. WOULD BE AND WE ESTIMATE WOULD BE AROUND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THAT'S A POINT 1% -- THANK YOU OKAY SO THE THE AND THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WAS SAYING ALSO WAS THAT IN THE LONG TERM. THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO COST CALIFORNIANS POINT 1% IN ADDITIONAL PAYROLL TAX DEDUCTION WHICH IF THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS WAGES SIXTY TWO THOUSAND YEAR. ABOUT SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A YEAR SO WOULD YOU WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THAT'S A REASONABLE ESTIMATE LONG TERM OF WHAT -- OF WHAT EXTENSION OF THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM WILL OR WILL COST. I GENERALLY I THINK YOU KNOW THOSE NUMBERS ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE ARE THINKING OF WOULD MAKE THE POINT THOUGH THAT THAT MONEY IS NOT BEING USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT WOULD BE RETURNED TO PARTICIPANTS WERE. PAYING THAT IF THEY CHOOSE TO TAKE PAID FAMILY LEAVE. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID -- SURE SAID THIS SIDE INCREASE OF POINT 1% WERE TO HAPPEN IT WOULD BE GOING INTO THE FUNDS SO IT WOULD NOT BE USED FOR OTHER. GENERAL FUND PURPOSES I UNDERSTAND SO YES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I OBJECTED TO IS THE WAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO COST CALIFORNIANS MONEY. AND THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT YES IT WILL COST EVERY CALIFORNIAN. SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A YEAR TO TO AFFECT THIS CHANGE. SO I THINK ARE ONLY RESPONSES TO FULL NUMBER ONE YOU KNOW WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND SECOND AND THIS IS OF COURSE AN ONGOING PROCESS BUT THIS TASK FORCE IS STARTING UP AND WE'RE HOPING TO IDENTIFY THE PATH FORWARD -- THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP. GIVING ANY OTHER COMMENTS. COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC. SEEING NONE. LET'S MOVE ON TO SB EIGHTY FOUR CAL ACCESS REPLACEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT. SO ONE MAJOR ITEM IN SB -- EIGHTY FOUR THIS IS -- AN UPDATE TO CAL ACCESS -- FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ONLINE FILING DISCLOSURE SYSTEM FOR CAMPAIGNS IT EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR A FEBRUARY UNTIL FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE CURRENT DEADLINE WOULD HAVE A NINETY DAY PERIOD. RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THAT STATE -- ELECTION SEASON NEXT YEAR AND THAT DEADLINE WAS SET BEFORE CALIFORNIA MOVED UP ITS PRIMARY NEXT YEAR FROM JUNE TO MARCH SERVICE PUSHES THAT DEADLINE TO AFTER THE ELECTION SEASON SO THAT THERE ARE NO -- THAT THEY WE HOPE THERE ARE FEWER HICK UPS AND IT ALSO PROVIDES SIX POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR IMPLEMENTATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SEE NUMBERS COULD SB EIGHTY FIVE RESOURCES. SO THIS RESOURCES AVAIL -- THEIR NUMBER OF COMPONENTS TO IT ONE IS SIX AND EXTENSION OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND UP THROUGH JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY THIRTY SECOND IS THE ESTABLISHMENT UNDER CAL FIRE OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS REVOLVING FUND. AND THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO COORDINATE WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ON FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME CHANGES HERE TO THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL FIRE LIFE SAFETY CLARIFYING THEIR MISSION RESPONSIBILITIES -- AS WELL AS SOME SMALL CHANGES -- REGARDING -- GRF POLLUTION REDUCTION MAKING SURE THOSE EFFORTS ARE ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY EFFORTS. THANK YOU MISS COOPER. WE ARE GOING THE GST IMPLEMENTATION AUDIT PROGRAM WHY REMOVING THE CAP ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDS A RB MAY COLLECT. TO LIVE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS BASICALLY GIVING THEM A LITTLE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE FEES WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL ONE OF THIS INCREASE THE CAPS OFFICIALLY TO COVER THE COST. OF MOVING THE REQUIRED STATE PROGRAMS. SO THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT DATE THROUGH THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS THE COST OF PAYING KERR THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COVER THOSE BUT I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO SPEAK. BACK TO THE TRAILER BILL DOES REMOVE THE CAP FOR THE CERTIFICATION AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AS YOU REFERENCE FOR PHASE TWO OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS. REDUCTIONS STANDARDS THIS IS TO COVER THE REASONABLE COSTS OF ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE REVENUES OF THE GOING INTO THE CERTIFICATION AND COMPLIANCE FUND. AND IT'S GOVERNED BY BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATIONS SO THERE IS A MECHANISM BY WHICH THE LEGISLATURE WE WAYNE IN ANNUALLY ON THEIR LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES IN THAT PROGRAM ALSO BY VIRTUE OF IT BEING IN THE CERTIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE FIND IN A SEPARATE FUND IT'LL BE VERY VISIBLE. AS AN EXPENDITURE REVENUE LEVELS AS A WAY TO ALSO MONITOR. THESE ACTIVITIES IN THOSE LEVELS. OKAY AS MORE QUESTION OR ISN'T IN THE INDEPENDENT EMISSIONS MARKET BUYS WE COMMITTEE. THE PROVISIONAL COMMUNICATIONS ALSO AUTHORIZED MEETING IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THEM GREATER FLEXIBILITY. WHAT TYPE OF CONVERSATIONS ARE THERE ARE THESE THE ONLY TO HAVE THEM IN TOGETHER PRIVATE? SHE'S CONVERSATIONS GOTTEN OPEN REALISTIC COLORS CAN PARTICIPATE. I HAD TO RESET I'M SORRY DINNERS MYSELF THERESA CALIBER WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND DEAD COMMITTEE IS AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THAT CHANGES BEING MADE TO FACILITATE. DISCUSSIONS AMONG THE MEMBERS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO YOU KNOW ANALYZING SOME OF THE THE THE PROGRAMS ARE QUESTIONS BEFORE THEN WE HAVE TALKED TO THE AIR RESOURCES. BOARD ABOUT -- WHAT THAT MEANS IN PRACTICE THEY DON'T EXPECT IT TO SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE HOW THEY HOLD MEETINGS AND PUBLIC MEETINGS FOR THIS COMMITTEE -- BUT STILL IT'S STILL IT WOULD BE JUST PUZZLES ME FOR ANY GROUP LEGALIZATION WHETHER ADVISED HER NOT TO MEET IN PRIVATE HEALTH DISCUSSIONS THAT'S THE COLOR OF A LOT OF FOLKS WRONG OBVIOUSLY THE BETTER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. THE BROWN ACT THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL FOR ANY TYPE OF BODY SO CAN YOU DOUBLE THAT FURTHER. NO I'M I HAVE I DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE TOO MUCH MORE DETAIL OTHER THAN I KNOW IT WAS DONE TO THE I CAN FACILITATE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT THERE IS NO -- INTENTION BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO KIND OF CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE MEETINGS THEY HAVE NOW WHICH ARE HI MY UNDERSTAND IS PUBLIC AND SO. THAT'S KIND OF THE EXTENT OF THE INFORMATION I HAVE THAT WE CAN KEEP LOOKING INTO IT AND TRY TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH MORE THAT THE GREAT THANK YOU OKAY MISTER FOE. I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON A MISTER COOPER'S QUESTION ARE THEREANY OTHER COMMITTEES OR AGENCIES THAT ARE EXEMPTED FROM THE BIG THE KLEENEX. THE VAGUELY KEEN OPEN MEETINGS ACT. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON HAND SO THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER THING WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SOUTH WANTING TO GET OF A BIGGER PICTURE BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN AND HOW THAT INFORMATION. OKAY I MEAN I I SURE MISTER COOPER'S CONCERNING IT JUST SEEMS THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY NO LESS [inaudible] THIS FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MOVING BACK TO NUMBER ONE ON THIS WITH THE MISTER COOPER TO DRESSED. THIS ORDINARILY WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH MY COMMITTEE IS THE CHAIR TRANSPORTATION AND REMOVING THE CAP CONCERNS ME. GENERALLY BECAUSE IT'S ON ON AND WE'RE NOT REPORTED TO ON A REGULAR BASIS SO IF THESE THINGS HAPPEN -- ONE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT IT IS IT'S THE PUBLIC. LETS US KNOW -- SO I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT GIVING ANYBODY UNBRIDLED AUTHORITY TO RAISE THE RAISE THE CAP ARRAYS. OF FEES WITHOUT SOME KIND OF CHECK BOUNCING CHECK IN PLACE. GOING FOR SO THIS THIS -- ONE I REALLY NEED TO HAVE IT OR DRESSED IN A I THINK A MORE TRANSPARENT AND ALSO -- SECURE MANNER FOR FOR THE THE MORE REPUBLIC. IN ADDITION TO THE BUDGETARY PROCESS MENTIONED EARLIER THE FEES REQUIRE REGULATIONS IN THOSE WILL GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PUBLIC -- REGULATIONS PROCESS BY THEIR RESOURCES FOR SO THAT'S ANOTHER -- FACET OF THIS YEAH I THINK I WOULD PREFER THIS GOES THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE ALSO ON ON THAT. ON THAT FASTENED BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS. THAT -- ANY AGENCY THAT HAS UNBRIDLED AUTHORITY TO RAISE FEES WITHOUT -- SOME KIND OF BOUNCING CHECKS BUDGET COULD JUSTIFICATION -- CONCERNS ME. THANK YOU -- MISTER YOUNGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON THE WILD FIRE FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS AND YOU KNOW FIRST OF ALL -- COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION ON ITS WORK TO DO THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS STATE WIDE -- STREAMLINED PROJECTS TO REALLY GET OUT THE FUELS REDUCTION MY CONCERN IS THAT IN THIS TRAILER BILL THERE WERE REQUIRING. CONSULTATION WITH WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE -- IN MY CONSUMER DOES IT THIS WOULD SLOW DOWN I MEAN THE IDEA IS A STREAMLINED WE NEED TO GET TO THESE PROJECTS QUICKLY. WE NEED TO REDUCE THE FUEL LOADS AND ARE AND ARE FORCED IT AREAS IN OUR WILDLAND INTERFACES -- TOO YOU KNOW BECAUSE TO ME THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST FACTORS INVOLVED IN THESE -- CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES -- SO. YOU CAN YOU SPEAK TO THIS OF ME HAVING THIS CONSULTATION REQUIREMENT TO ME SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING. TO POTENTIALLY SLOW DOWN -- THE STREAMLINED PROJECTS. STEPHEN BENSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE WERE VERY CAREFUL IN THE CRAFTING OF THE LANGUAGE -- TO INSURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO COLLABORATE WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES -- MEADORS KINDA SEEK THE ADVICE OF BUT THE OTHER AGENCIES DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DELAY THE PROJECTS JUST CAL FIRE IS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GO AND GATHER INFORMATION EXPERTISE FROM THOSE OTHER AGENCIES. IN HOW THEY MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON THE PROJECTS. SO DOES THAT MEAN IS WILL BE A FORMAL CONSULATE IS THAT RIGHT. THE VERY I GUESS BECAUSE I USE THE TERMINOLOGY MISS LIKE A CONSUL IN TERMS OF LIKE THEY DON'T MEAN THERE'S NOT LIKE SOME SORT OF APPROVAL PROCESS RELATED TO IT IT'S THEIR THEIR REQUIRED TO GO OUT AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND GET. GET ADVICE -- LIKE I THINK THEY'RE NOT LIKE SUBMITTING SOME SORT OF FORM WAITING FOR TO GET APPROVED AND STAMPED AND SIGNED OFFER PERMIT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST IT'S IN DOWN AND TALKING WITH BOAT WITH FOLKS IN AND GETTING INPUT.ON THE DECISIONS. AND THAT WON'T RESULT IN SLOWING DOWN THOSE PROJECTS. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IS NOT SLOWING DOWN THE PROJECTS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. IT'S JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THE IMPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT REVOLVING FUND FOR CALIFORNIE ME DESCRIPTION WHAT'S THE SIZE THE FUN WORK WHAT KIND OF IT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE. INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO CAL FIRE STATIONS OR WATER WE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO THIS FUND IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT -- PARKS HAS FOR ITS CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM. IF THERE'S NO ACTUAL FUND BALANCE THAT JUST SITS IN THERE DOESN'T HAVE A REVENUE SOURCE WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES FUNDING FOR A PROJECT. THAT FUNDING CAN BE TRANSFERRED INTO THIS REVOLVING FUND AND THE BENEFIT F IT IS THAT IT HELPS TO ENCUMBER FUNDS THAT. SO NORMALLY IN A CAPITAL PROJECT YOU WOULD INCOME FOR MOST OF THE FUNDS WITH CONTRACTS -- THERE'S THIS PORTION OF THOSE PROJECTS FUNDS THAT ARE RELATED TO LIKE PAYROLL FIRST STATE PEOPLE THAT WORK ON IT. THE WAY THE PAYROLL SYSTEM WORKS IN ACCOUNTING YOU CAN ENCUMBER THOSE AND SO IT ALLOWS YOU PLACE TO ENCUMBER THE FUNDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECTS AND THE CONTRACTORS -- CAN REMAIN THROUGH THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT TO RE CREATING A FUND BUT WE'RE NOT PUTTING ANY MONEY IN IT UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES -- CORRECT. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU THIS REST [inaudible] NUMBER. SEVEN IS THIS RELATED TO EIGHT AB [inaudible] SIX SEVENTEEN NUMBER. SEVEN BUT THIS IS ON THE COMMUNITY EIGHT EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM. AND COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THIS WHAT WHAT. SEVEN WHAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. YES THIS IS AN RELATED AB -- SIX SEVENTEEN TRADITIONALLY WE'VE HAD THESE PROVISIONS IN OUR BUDGET BILL OR PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THE ACTION AND AND AND CONFERENCE WAS TO MOVE THOSE INTO STATUTES OF THIS IS NOT REFLECTED IN TRAILER BILL BUT IT NEARS. THAT PROVISIONS THAT HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN CARRIED IN THE BUDGET BILLING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE FOR THE PROGRAM. GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS PUBLIC COMMENT. YES MISTER CHAIR JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN THE MOUNT LINE FOUNDATION WE DON'T OFFER SUPPORT -- FOR THIS TRAILER BILL IN PARTICULAR THE EXTENSION OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND AND WANT TO EXPLICITLY SINGLE OUT THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM IN YOU TERM AND TING FOR MAKING THIS -- HAPPEN. THANK YOU. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY SIGNALS COULD SB EIGHTY SEVEN TRANSPORTATION. THREE ITEMS TO HIGHLIGHT ON SB EIGHTY SEVEN THE FIRST IS THE REPAYMENT OF ALL OUTSTANDING TRANSPORTATION LOANS THIS AMOUNTS TO OVER BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS ALSO IS PART OF PAYING OFF THE WALL JACK FROM THE LAST RECESSION. SECOND SB ONE HAD ESTABLISHED -- INSPECTOR GENERAL AT CALTRANS AND THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE OFFICE OF AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS AT CALTRANS MAKING SURE THAT. COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEM CAN BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND THEN THIRD THIS TRAILER BILL ESTABLISHES THAT THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION STATEWIDE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR SHORT LINES RAIL MR FUNG. IN TERMS OF THE THE TRANSPORTATION. DEBT SERVICE. AFTER IT'S PAID -- FOR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE LA OR THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ALLOWS THE CONVERSION OF THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION. INTRO QUITE FEES AND JUST WHICH OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDS TO NOW BE A PERMANENT GENERAL FUND TRANSFER IS THAT CORRECT. NO THE END IN TERMS OF THE USE OF WEIGHT FEE OF MARKET REFORM TO FINANCE ARE -- THE AND IN TERMS OF THE USE OF WEIGHT FEES FOR DEBT SERVICE THAT'S IT IN CURRENT LAW. HUESO THEN ONCE SO IF THERE'S NO DEBT SERVICE WHAT WHERE DOES THE TRUCK WAY FEES GO. I HAVE TO GET BACK JOHN THAT. I ADMIT I THINK WE'VE GOT. ENOUGH DEBT SERVICE FROM PROP WOULD BE FOR TO GO FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS RIGHT BUT THEN BUT THEN IT AFTER THAT. RIGHT WHAT HAPPENS TO DROP WEIGHT FEES MAY ONCE YOU ONCE ONCE THE DEBT SERVICE IS COMPLETED MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT EVENTUALLY BECAUSE THE GENERAL FUND SO. THEY ARE YOU CONCERNED OR IS THERE ANY CONCERN FOR THE MINISTRATION THAT THIS PROPOSAL FOR NON TRANSMISSION PURPOSES ONCE IT GOES INTO THE GENERAL FUND. NO NO -- NO AND AND SAID IT CLEAR FINDER CURRENT LAW -- THE WE HAVE -- DANIEL WAIT FEES GO TO PAY THE ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE AND UP TO A CERTAIN POINT IN A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD -- ENOUGH WEEK FEES TO KIND OF BANK SOME OF IT AND THEN -- WE'VE BEEN PAYING THAT DOWN I THINK THROUGH TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS THE NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILL BE THE LAST YEAR THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW KIND OF BANK TO WAIT FEES THAT WE WOULD USE TO PAY DOWN DEBT SERVICE SO -- ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES THE IT FUNDS THE AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD REPAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THE SERVICE AND JUST REPEAT. REPLACE A YEAR EARLY TWO SO POST TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T APPLY THAT'S CORRECT. SO. EIGHT SO IT WOULD STILL BE% POSSIBLE TO BE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. POST -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WILL. THERE WE NO MORE PAINT TO BE USED. RIGHT SO THERE SO THEN THEY'LL BE AT ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF TRUCK WAY FEES THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED. THAT MONEY WOULD STAY CAN BE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. ABSURD THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED SO. OVER THE LONG TERM FROM. I CAN'T A FIVE TEN FIFTEEN YEARS PROBABLY -- THAT AMOUNT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED ANNUALLY DANIEL THAT ONE POINT TWO BILLION WILL BE USED FOR ANNUAL DEBT SERVICE COSTS. AND SO THE AMOUNT THAT SAID HERE IS REALLY RELATIVE -- TO TO I GUESS RECALL OF BORROWING THAT WE HAD DONE I'M RESEARCH -- IN RICHMOND PAST YEARS WE HAD MORE WEIGHT FEES AND WE NEEDED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUAL YEARS DEBT SERVICE. THIS THIS BILL ONCE TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS DONE WOULD MAKE THAT LAST PAYMENT. THAT'LL BE DONE AND AFTER THAT -- WILL BE IS ALL WAIT FEES FOR DEBT SERVICE ANY AND WITH THE AND I GUESS THAT THE I GUESS AS TO CONFUSE OR MAYBE THAT'S WERE TALKING TO EACH OTHER BUT OPPOSE WHEN TWENTY ONE THERE IS A SERVICE. ORDER THERE THERE'S ONE PLENTY OF THAT SERVICE YES BUT BUT ON TRANSPORTATION ON TRANSPORTATION IS OBVIOUSLY THAT PROP ONE B. YES OKAY. AND THEN HOW HOW MUCH THAT SERVICE WOULD BE HOW MANY HOW MANY YEARS OF DEBT SERVICE WOULD BE PROPERTY. I HAVE TO GET BACK JAY WOULD SAY AT LEAST TEN YEARS OKAY THANK YOU. OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CAN THE PUBLIC ON OKAY SAYING NONE DISCARDED AS BEING. NINETY TWO SO SB NINETY TWO DEALS WITH TAXATION AND REVENUE A COUPLE OF ITEMS OF NOTE HERE FIRST -- IN THE BUDGET AGREEMENT -- THE DIAPER AND FEMININE HYGIENE SALES TAX EXEMPTION THIS WILL BE FOR TWO YEARS COMPLETE EXEMPTION FROM JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE BACK FILL FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT OF LOCAL REVENUE FIND. A SECOND THIS BILL -- THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE -- HAD BOTH PASSED THE AB ONE FORTY SEVEN BILL EARLIER THIS SPRING -- COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS WAY FAIR THIS CLARIFIES THE RULES RELATED TO THAT DEAL SPECIFICALLY -- THE DEFINITION OF MARKETPLACE FACILITATORS THIRD -- FOR SALES TAX AT BACK TAXES COLLECTION FOR CD TFA THIS BILL LIMITS TO LOOK BACK PERIOD -- IN RELATION TO THOSE TAXES WE WERE DISCUSSING TO THREE YEARS AND FINALLY A STREAMLINING RELATED TO THE TA THIS IS THE OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS. IF AN INDIVIDUAL OR A BUSINESS HAS A CLAIM THAT IS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT -- THIS TRAILER BILL WOULD ALLOW THAT CLAIM TO BE HEARD BY ONE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RATHER THAN A PANEL OF JUDGES. THANK YOU MISTER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO REGARDING THE A DIAPER AND FEMININE HYGIENE SALES TAX EXEMPTION WHEREABOUTS DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT WANT A SUNSET ON THAT THAT EXEMPTION AND THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO YOUR SUNSET AND ADMINISTRATION GOT ITS WAY SO THE QUESTION IS. DO YOU INTEND TO REPEAL THAT TAX IN TWO YEARS. SO THAT TAX SUNSET ON ITS OWN -- I THINK THAT IS A QUESTION FOR FUTURE WHY JUST WAGER AND ADMINISTRATION AND IT'LL BE BASED ON PRIMARILY THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE STATE AT THAT TIME WHICH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A PROJECTION BUT IT'S REALLY ANYBODY'S. GUESS AS WELL AS ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF THESE -- TAX EXEMPTION. OKAY WELL I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT -- THE POLITICAL FEASIBILITY FOR PEELING ATTACKS LIKE THAT IS VERY LOW SO. I THOUGHT I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT AND SAY THIS THIS IS A PERMANENT EXEMPTION INSTEAD OF A SUNSETEXEMPTION -- IT AND DEAL WITH THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THAT NOW RATHER THAN KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD TO FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S BUT UNDERSTAND OUR POINT OF VIEW THIS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ENGAGE IN ON ON THE ISSUE OF MINSTREL EQUITY. HI NOTICES THAT FAR FROM WHERE WE HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS -- I I DO WANT TO MAKE THE POINT OF THAT SEPARATE FROM BEING HONEST OR NOT THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING ABOUT. A WOMAN'S BODY OUR BIOLOGY. BEING REMOVED FROM THE LIST OF LUXURIES BUT ONLY FOR TWO YEARS -- AND THE MESSAGE THAT WE SHOULD BE SEVEN ABOUT THIS BEING PERMANENTLY -- HOW WE? TELL YOU SEE ON THIS BODY CENTER BIOLOGY AND IT'S IT'S NOT A LUXURY.

SECONDS ARE A NUMBER F ITEMS RELATED TO THE APPS THIS IS THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM -- THERE'S A BACKLOG AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IN COMMITTEE AND SO THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY REPORTING LANGUAGE AND METRICS OF THAT A LEGISLATORS IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE INFORMED ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE BACKLOG AND THE HOW WELL THE STATE IS DOING IN REMEDYING THAT BACKLOG. FIRST I'M SORRY THIRD A ARE SOME REPORTING METRICS AROUND POST THIS IS THAT COMMISSION PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. REGARDING THAT EXTRA TRAINING FUNDING AND HOW THEY'RE USING IT AND SOME METRICS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND FINALLY ETS -- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CARE THIS IS CALIFORNIA REENTRY INTO IN RICHMOND GRANT PROGRAMS TO HELP. FACILITATE RE ENTRY SERVICES. THANK YOU. MR SORE YES AND I I WANTED. KOMMENDE AT THE GOVERNOR ON ON ON JUST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND JUST BRING IN A JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND LOOKING AT IT IN A NEW LIGHT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION I GUESS IS. WHAT YOU YOUR PLAN TO CALL IT YEAH -- I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE CALLED IT PROMPT DEPARTMENT OF AT PROMISED TO DOUBT. BARTON BUT IN THAT. YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHAT NAME YOU WANT TO CALL IT -- BUT THE THING I I REALLY AM ENCOURAGED ABOUT IS THAT YOU WILL HAVE SOME KIND OF HE TO LOOK AT HOW THIS IS CREATED I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. THE FACT IT WILL KEEP COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE ALL THE WAY TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO -- WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO'S GOING TO MAKE UP TO CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE THIS SO WE CAN GET A HANDLE ON THAT -- TOO I THINK IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ON THE ARM PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM. THAT -- WE HAVE OVERSIGHT AND NOT ONLY HAD ANNUAL REPORTS BUT WE HAVE NO MORE EXCUSES ABOUT NOT CLEANING UP. THE APP SYSTEM AND THAT THIS LEGISLATURE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN IT AND THE SENATE. THAT WE GET THIS DONE FINALLY I'VE BEEN HERE. A SEVEN YEARS AND EVERY YEAR I GET ANOTHER OR EVERY TWO YEARS AGO ANOTHER EXCUSE WE SHOULD NOT. TOLERATE ANY MORE EXCUSES TO GET THIS DONE AND SO I I APPLAUD. THAT CHEERED THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEN ON THE THE GRANTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA RE ENTRY AND RICHMOND GRANTS I KIND OF WANT TO GET WHAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS YEAR KIND OF THE FEEL WOULD FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY. I'VE HAD MANY THAT ARE WORKING REAL BILL TATIAN WITHIN THE SYSTEM THE COMMUNITY BASED COMING IN. THAT ARE LOOKING FOR GRANTS AND SO I WOULD WANT TO GET AN IDEA TO SEE IF THEY CAN APPLY -- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT -- DID YOU NEED GROUPS THAT HAVE OF DOG TRAINING AND THE ACTORS GUILD AND OTHERS THAT -- WE WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE INCLUDED. AND THEN -- THE THE FINALLY THERE'S A THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME IT WAS CDC ARE WHEN I TALK ABOUT. RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN MAKING SURE THAT WE WE SHOW HOW THESE PROGRAMS HAVE. GIVE YOU SYNDICATE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WANTED THINGS THE LAST CD C. R. WHICH I SEE IS IN HERE WHICH I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY ABOUT. IS I BASS WHEN SOMEONE IS RELEASED AFTER GOING TO A PROGRAM LEARNING A TRADE OR WHATEVER. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE NOT THE RECIPIENT THEY ALWAYS TELL ME THEY DON'T KNOW? AND I SAID SOMETIMES VERY EASY BY. GETTING A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER CHECKING WITH WHETHER NOT THEY PAID THEIR STATE TAXES COULD TAKE PAY THEIR STATE TAXES UNLESS THEY'RE VERY GOOD CRIMINALS. GOING NINE TO FIVE WORK EVERY DAY AND THEN THEY'RE BEING CRIMINALS AFTER AFTER WORK LET'S DO A VERY GOOD AND CAN STAY UP ALL NIGHT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT. AND WHEN I ASKED WHY DON'T YOU CHECK WITH THE STATE FRANCHISE BOARD THEY SAID WOULD THEY CAN'T THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THEY THEY PROBABLY NEED LEGISLATION AND A SIT IN FRONT OF ME I GOT YOU KNOW I'M ONE OF A HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THAT LEGISLATION HAPPEN. WHY HAVEN'T YOU EVER COME TO US -- SO A LOT OF A LOT OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO PROVE THAT IS REAL BILL TATIAN PROGRAMS WORK AS RIGHT IN FRONT OF US AND WE DON'T AND CDC ARE WE DON'T MAKE THIS SPECIAL EFFORT. TO TRY TO ACTUALLY GET THAT DONE I THINK THAT WILL HELP THEM IN THE LONG RUN IN THIS PART ABOUT WORKING WITH -- CDC ARE TO PROVIDE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS RELEASED INDIVIDUALS TO EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO TRACK LABOR MARKET ANOTHER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES. WILL HAVE. A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON HOW MUCH MORE MONEY WE NEED TO PUT INTO REHABILITATION SO I COMMEND YOU ON THAT. THIS RESIDENTS QUESTION. MISS COOPER THE FOLLOWING UP ON MISTER JONES LAWYERS QUESTIONS ABOUT RECIDIVISM AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WE KNOW MOST FOLKS DON'T GO BACK TO A PRISON. MAJORITY YOU'RE BEING SENT TO COUNTY JAIL SO WHAT I DO FOR THE COUNTY JAILS ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT. ARE DIPPING A WHO YOU ARE EFFECTIVELY INEFFECTIVE SO. WE KNOW IS HALF OVER THERE SO WHY NOT DO IT WITH THE OTHERWISE YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL PICTURE VERGE RECIDIVISM RATE IS. SO FOR SOME REASON WERE ALWAYS EXCLUDING THE SHERIFF'S SO THE B. B. TO INCLUDE HIM TO GET A BETTER PICTURE. WE SPELL OUT OF MONEY THERE THIS FAR AS THE ABORTION THAT PIECE OF TRAINING FUND WAS A FOR MONEY. FOR MONEY BEING USED FOR AGAIN. SORRY WE WERE GOING -- TO IN THE BUDGET AGREEMENT INCREASES FUNDING FOR THE PEACE OFFICER STAY OFF YOUR CHECK A PEACE OFFICER TRAINING FUND THAT YEAH LOS MENSAJES. WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY? COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EIGHT IT GOES TO THE SAME PURPOSES IT JUST USED TO BE A SUBSIDIARY FIND AT THE STATE PENALTY FINES SO AS REVENUES DECREASED TO THE STATE PENALTY FINE. WE WENT AWAY FROM HAVING SUBSIDIARY FUNDS AND WE JUST HAVE WE'RE FINDING EVERYONE DIRECTLY FROM THE STATE POLICE FIND SO IT'S REALLY TECHNICAL IN NATURE. TO SORT OF CAUGHT UP BY OUR EXISTING BUDGET PRACTICES FOR STE THANK YOU. THE THE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU HAVE NO GOING BACK IF THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BALLOT OR THE BUDGET MEASURE -- PARTICULARLY AS INTEREST IN. TRANSITION TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE REHABILITATED SINCE IN NATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE NO ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. LET'S MOVE ON TO SB. NINETY FIVE TWO MAJOR CHANGES IN SB NINETY FIVE BOTH OF THEM RELATED TO THE COURTS THE FIRST -- AS PART OF THE BUDGET AGREEMENT IS THE INCLUSION OF TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS AND THESE WOULD BE ALLOCATED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND THIS COMES AT A COST OF THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND THE SECOND IS AN INCREASE IN THAT TRIAL CORPORATE SERVE CAP FROM 1% 23% EFFECTIVE JUNE OF NEXT YEAR WHICH WILL GIVE OUR TRIAL COURTS A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR BUDGETING. THANK YOU MISTER BROWN. TO JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS IT'S GONNA GO A LONG WAYS TOWARDS RESTORING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. HAD A QUESTION ABOUT RAISING THE TRIAL COURT RESERVE CAP -- IS YOU KNOW THAT CAP WAS IMPOSED AND DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COURTS SPENT THROUGH THEIR RESERVES BEFORE THEY NEEDED STATE ASSISTANCE. THE QUESTION IS WHY DOES THERE NEED TO BE A CAP ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ONE BEFORE WHY IS SO THE ADMINISTRATION DEFINITELY WANTED TO INCREASE THE CAP YOU KNOW NOW THAT WE ARE OUT OF THE RECESSION I THINK YOU'LL FIND WITH A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS. THERE ARE GENERALLY CAPS IN PLACE AND I THINK THE REASON IS ONE IT MAKES AFFECTED BUDGETING PRACTICE WHERE YOU WANT -- INSTEAD CITIES TO HAVE RESERVES BY IF THEY HAVE SUCH LARGE RESERVES WELL BEYOND WHAT THEY NEED THEN I THINK IT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION FOR LEGISLATORS FOR TAXPAYERS YOU WONDER WHY ARE WE APPROPRIATING MORE MONEY TO THEM WHEN THEY HAVE SUCH A BIG QUESTION. WHEN THAT MONEY COULD BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT SO IT'S A BALANCE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RESERVE IS NOT TOO SMALL BECAUSE IT CAN MAKE PLANNING VERY UNPREDICTABLE? BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE ESCORTS OR OTHER ENTITIES TO HAVE A HEALTHY RESERVE THEN THAT MONEY CAN BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. OKAY WELL I MEAN I THINK THAT THERE WERE SOME BAD ACTORS WHEN THE RESERVE WAS IMPOSED THE CAP WAS IMPOSED. BUT MOST OF OUR TRIAL COURTS ARE NOT BAD ACTORS AND THEY REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THAT RESERVE CAP IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT EVEN 3% IS JUST. A COUPLE WEEKS. OF RESERVE WHICH IS NOT VERY MUCH MONEY IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR TRIAL COURTS TO BUDGET FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FOR THEM SO. I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE REALLY WE DON'T NEED A RESERVE CAP ANYMORE BUT % BETTER THAN 1%. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEE NO MORE BECAUSE THE CLEANING THE PUBLIC COMMENT. SEE NUMBERS MOVE ON THE SB. NINETY SIX SIR SB NINETY SIX REFERS TO THE STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT THIS IS THE SPECIAL FINDS THAT FUNDS IMPROVEMENT TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WAS ON THE VERGE OF INSOLVENCY. AND SO WHAT THIS TRAILER BILL DOES IS IT CHANGES THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH CHARGED A FEE ON INTERSTATE VOICE CALLS ON AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AS MORE PEOPLE SHIFT FROM VOICE CALLS TO TEXTING AND OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATION. THE FEE REVENUE WAS DECLINING THREATENING OUR ABILITY TO FUND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS FOR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS AT EXACTLY THE TIME WHEN WERE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCING INCREASING WILDFIRES AND OTHER EMERGENCIES. AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY RELYING ON UPGRADES TO THAT SYSTEM BUILDING REDUNDANCIES INTO IT SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE CALL 911- EMERGENCY THAT CALL WILL BE RELIABLE AND IT WILL REACH DISPATCH QUICKLY. SO WHAT THIS TRAILER BILL DIES IT'S WHICH IS FROM AN INTERESTING VOICE COFFEE TO A FLAT FEE ON ACCESS LINES -- IT WOULD BE UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL BETWEEN ZERO AND EIGHTY CENTS WE ARE ESTIMATING FOR THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE FEE WOULD CON MAN AT THIRTY FOUR CENTS SO THAT SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF VARIABLES -- I'D BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FEE WILL ENABLE -- THE ADMINISTRATION THE STATE TO REPLENISH THAT ACCOUNT AND FUND THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ARE COUNTING ON THANK YOU. MISTER RELATED. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT -- YES NEEDS NINE ONE ONE WHERE WE AUTHORIZING THEM -- TO FOR A SURCHARGE OF UP TO EIGHTY CENTS. SO I THINK THE MAIN REASON IS BECAUSE THIS IS -- TRAILER BILL AND GOES IN THE STATUTE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY BUILT AND NOT JUST FOR THIS YEAR FOR NEXT YEAR BUT FOR MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE UPGRADING OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IS NOT A ONE YEAR OR TWO YEAR. I'VE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE CONTINUALLY I WILL POINT OUT THAT AT THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT -- SO THIS FEE WILL RAISE MONEY FOR THAT SPECIAL FUNDS BUT HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT IN OVERSIGHT IS A LOT UP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. SO THE BALANCE OF THAT FIND AND THE NEED TO INCREASE THE FEE -- WILL ULTIMATELY DEPEND IN MANY WAYS ON HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO APPROPRIATE OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT FOR UPGRADES TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WELL I THINK WE'RE ALL. FANS OF UPGRADING TO NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE BUT I'M SURE I'M NOT ALONE IN OPINING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN ACTIVE ROLE. IN OVERSIGHT OF THAT PROJECT AND TO AUTHORIZE A MAXIMUM CAP OF OVER TWICE WHAT'S REQUIRED SEEMS A LITTLE FOOLHARDY. LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THAT THE WHICH IS. REALLY MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR TRAILER BILL WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR. WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO INCREASE TAXES? ON OUR CONSTITUENTS IN HERE ONE OF BUDGET SURPLUSES THAT LARGE RICHEST THE OPTICS OF IT ARE TERRIBLE. SO OUR VIEW OF THIS IS THAT WE ARE SWITCHING TO A SYSTEM THAT'S FOLLOWED BY YEAH I THINK FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES YOU KNOW -- SO WHERE WELL BEHIND THE CURVE CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO HOW WE STRUCTURE OUR NINE ONE ONE FEES SO THERE IS A NINE ONE ONE FEE IN PLACE IT'S JUST NOT ACCOMPLISHING THE PURPOSES. FOR WHICH WAS INTENDED BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE OR WHEN WE FIRST REALLY STARTED STANDING UP THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. AND WHEN IT COMES MORE BROADLY TO THE SURPLUS THAT YOU MENTIONED -- WE OF COURSE BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THAT SURPLUS AS MUCH AS ALMOST 90% IS BASED ON ONE TIME FUNDING AND BECAUSE WE'VE YOU UPGRADING THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AS AN ON GOING PROJECT. WE DO BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE MATCHED WITH AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING WELL THEN I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF FUNDING IT. THIS YEAR OUT OF OUR RESERVE OUT OF OUR A SURPLUS IN IN FUTURE YEARS IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FUND IT THEN GOING TO CALIFORNIANS. AND ASKING THEM TO FUNDED BECAUSE ASKING THEM TO FUNDED NOW. IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A LARGE SURPLUS I THINK IS UNCONSCIONABLE. I WILL MAKE ONE FINAL POINT WHICH IS THAT THIS FEE I BELIEVE GOES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY -- TWENTY TWENTY OF TWENTY TWENTY SO FOR THESE LAST SIX MONTHS -- IT DOES NCLUDE A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION AS THE NEW FEE STRUCTURE IS BEING SETTING UP MOBILE WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WE COULD EASILY FUNDED IT NEXT YEAR. AND COME BACK THE YEAR AFTER THAT IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A SURPLUS ANYMORE [inaudible] THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WITH A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT HOW MUCH DO WE EXPECT TO RAISE WITH THE THIRTY FIVE CENTS -- THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. AND SO IT THIRTY FOUR CENTS -- WE AND ON A FULL YEAR IS IT MISTER MISS MISS ONE OFTEN YEAH I JUST POINTED OUT THAT -- IT GOES INTO EFFECT JAN FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY SO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET IS ONLY ASSUMING SIX MONTHS AT THAT RATE BUT A FULL YEAR AT THAT RATE WOULD RAISE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY SO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION SO -- THE ADDITIONAL FIVE CENTS WOULD NOT BE A BEGIN IF WE DID ONLY FORTY CENTS INSTEAD OF EIGHTY CENTS TO FIVE CENTS WOULD NOT BE A BIG ENOUGH CUSHION. IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S WHAT WE NEED THE EIGHTY CENTS. SO THE WAY THAT THE THE TRAILER BILL IS SET UP IS THERE'S A VERY -- TYPE PARAMETER CALCULATION ON HOW THE FEE IS SET. TO THE CAP UP TO EIGHTY CENTS BUT YES HAS. VERY MINIMAL -- CONTROL OVER HOW THAT ACTUALLY IS CALCULATED SO THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS. THE FUND BALANCE IN SET NOW IS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE'S ANNUAL AMOUNT OF PREPARATION FROM SET NOW. AND THEN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES THAT ARE REPORTED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS -- TO YES. SO THERE'S NOT REALLY A DISCRETIONARY PIECE ON YES IS PART IN HOW THAT FEE IS CALCULATED. ONCE THE LEGISLATURE MAKES A DETERMINATION ON HOW MUCH THE PERFORATED FROM SET NOW. THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY DIVIDE THAT AMOUNT BY THE NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES AND THAT'S WHAT DETERMINES WHAT THE FEE WILL BE FOR THAT FOR THE UPCOMING FISH CARRIER RIGHT THANK YOU -- BUT YOU KNOW EARLIER IN THE A PREVIOUS TRAILER BILLS WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE RESERVES THAT 3% RESERVES VERSUS THE 1% AND AND THE STATEMENT WAS YOU KNOW WE WANT TO CAPITA WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH. AND SO IN MY OPINION THE YOU KNOW HAVING THEIR A FEET UP TO EIGHTY CENTS -- SEEMS LIKE OVER SO -- I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT WE'RE LEAVING IT THAT BIG OF A CUSHION OPEN AND I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE FORTY CENTS. GIVING US THE FIVE CENT QUESTION AS OPPOSED TO FIFTY FIVE CENT CUSHION AND THAT'S BASICALLY JUST. MY OPINION -- BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM AND I THINK WE'RE ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW HAVING THE QUOTE ON QUOTE FLEXIBILITY UP TO EIGHTY CENTS IS KIND OF AS A CONSUMER WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT I KNOW IT'S ONLY EIGHTY CENTS WE OXY IT WOULD ONLY EIGHTY CENTS BUT A LOT OF OUR POPULATION AND EIGHTY CENTS COULD. YOU KNOW. IF YOU HAVE THREE OR FOUR LINES -- KANNADA UP. QUICKLY AND I THINK THAT'S WHY MOST THE DISCRETION IN HOW THEY GET SAID IS ACTUALLY LEFT TO THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT DETERMINES HOW MUCH APPROPRIATE FROM THE FUND. SO IT IS GOING TO BE AN OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE EXACTLY LEGISLATURE IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR WILL DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF CORPORATE FROM THAT FUND AND THAT IS THE LARGEST DETERMINANT IN WITH A FEW GET SET AT THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. YES THANK YOU SO SO IS THERE AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THIS OR IS THIS JUST WE ASK FOR THE INFORMATION AND THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. HAS TO THE FUN CONDITION STATEMENT THAT'S PUBLISHED IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR WOULD INDICATE WHAT THE EXPENDITURE AND REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND AND THAT WOULD YEAH WE OKAY STATEMENT DOESN'T A SELFLESS THE FEVER IT LISTS ALL THE INFORMATION THAT USED TO CATHOLIC THE FEES WE CAN VERY EASILY GIVE. YOU THAT. NOTE THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION -- SO I REPRESENT A LARGELY RURAL AREA AND WITH INCREASED RELIANCE ON SO TECHNOLOGY -- THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC FOR A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WE ACTUALLY HAD AN ENTIRE. AREA I WOULD GO OUT BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE SO WITH SOME OF THIS MONEY THEN. GOING FOR ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL HELP. IN THESE HARD TO REACH CELLULAR AREAS WHEN PEOPLE NEED TO REACH NINE ONE ONE DURING EMERGENCIES AND IS THAT IS THAT PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS BECAUSE I WILL TAKE IN IN ABOUT 4250% OF MY DISTRICT SOMETIMES THERE'S THERE'S NO CELL COVERAGE AT ALL. SO -- DURING AN EMERGENCY IN YOUR TRYING TO TRACK PEOPLE DOWN FOR THEY ARE TRYING TO TRACK PEOPLE DOWN IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT -- AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS -- CUT OFF BECAUSE OF LANDSLIDES THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN EVERY YEAR IN MY DISTRICTS SO. SO ARE WE ARE WE WORKING ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS WELL OR IS THIS JUST TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT. HELLO STATUS QUO SO THE FUNDING THAT WILL BE. AND THEN THE NEXT GENERALIZED. PROGRAM DOES BUILDING NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR HOW THE NINE ONE SYSTEM WORKS IT DOESN'T INCLUDE ME UP WHEN I CAN BE FUNDING LIKE NEW CELL TOWERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IN TERMS OF LIKE. CELL COVERAGE. THIS DOESN'T IT YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT BUT IT IS HELPING TO ADDRESS. THE RELIABILITY OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM ITSELF SO THAT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IN A MAJOR INCIDENT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN DISPATCH CENTERS GET OVERWHELMED CALLS GO UNANSWERED -- OR THEY GET ANSWERED YOU KNOW IN WELL OVER THREE SECONDS WHICH IS THE THE KIND OF THE TARGET. THE BIG FOCUS OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE NINE ONE ONE CALLS GOING ON ANSWERED THAT ALL NINE ONE CALLS GET ANSWERED QUICKLY. IF A DISPATCH CENTER HAS TO BE EVACUATED BECAUSE OF AN INCIDENT THOSE CALLS CAN BE READ REDIRECTED TO A NEIGHBORING CLOSE DISPATCH CENTER SO THAT THE CALL STILL GET ANSWERED PEOPLE STILL GET -- DIRECTION IT ALSO. PROVIDE SOME -- OVERTON WARNING COMPONENTS SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE WHICH IS KIND OF REVERSED NINE ONE IF YOU WILL WHERE THEY'LL HAVE THE ABILITY TO KIND OF PUSH INFORMATION OUT TO NINE ONE ONE FOLKS SO I RATHER THAN THIRTY PEOPLE CALL IN -- TO REPORT THE SAME INCIDENT YOU KNOW SOME POINT I BELIEVE THE HAVE THE CAPABILITY. TO RECEIVE REPORTS NAME PUSH OUT INFORMATION TO THE FOLKS IN THE AFFECTED AREA. BASED ON CELL COVERAGE THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT'S REALLY THE KIND OF THE FOCUS INCIDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ROBERTS. THANK YOU IT AND FOLLOWING UP ON THE ON THAT DISCUSSION -- AND SOMEBODY OF COUNTY WE DO HAVE A LOT OF REMOTE AREAS THAT ARE THERE. AND HOPEFULLY -- LOOKING AT THIS IN HERE IN THE DISCUSSION -- PREVIOUSLY FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHAT'S QUESTION. THE NEXT THE RECEPTION BETTER IN THE REMOTE AREAS THAT ARE THERE THAT WE CAN SAY THAT WE'RE EXPANDING. THAT AREA AND WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SCENE THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE REMOTE AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TAKING TO IT. IN ACCOUNT THIS WHOLE STATE IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS IT WILL MOVE FOR WITH THE NINE ONE SYSTEM. AND THE CAP OF EIGHTY CENTS. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COVERAGE ISSUES ARE BECAUSE OF A CELL TOWER COVERAGE THIS ISN'T GOING TO ADDRESS THAT SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF VERIZON OR EIGHTEEN TO YOU WHOEVER YOU KNOW THAT SERVICE PROVIDER IS. DOESN'T HAVE COVERAGE IN A PARTICULAR AREA. THIS ISN'T GOING TO BUILD CELL TOWERS PROVIDE THAT KIND OF COVERAGE THIS IS GOING -- TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE STATE FIRST RESPONDERS USE -- ON THE NINE ONE ONE AND AND THEIR ABILITY TO RECEIVE CALLS BUT I WILL MAKE THE ADDITIONAL POINTS SO -- MY COLLEAGUES RIGHT IT'S NOT A WE CAN'T EXPAND CULTURALLY NOT CENTER THE PURVIEW OF THAT CELL PHONE PROVIDER COMPANIES THEMSELVES -- BUT FOR PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS WERE ESPECIALLY DEPENDENT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT NOT BE NEAR A MEDICAL FACILITY OR NEAR AN EVACUATION CENTER. THEY ARE IN SOME WAYS RELYING ON NINE ONE ONE BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH IF THEY DO HAVE COVERAGE IN THIS COULD BE FROM A LAND LINE ALSO NOT NECESSARILY. A CELL PHONE MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE SO THIS REALLY MOVES TOWARD THAT TARGET OF HAVING THAT CALL BE ANSWERED IN THREE SECONDS OR LESS. IT IS A GREAT -- DIALOGUE AND IN A IN A TOPIC RIGHT FOR FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE DISCUSSION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURAL ASPECT OF THE REMOTE AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DOESN'T STOP THE DISCUSSION HERE -- PROVIDED THIS DOES BEFORE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MAYBE IF I CAN JUST HAVE YOU START BY EXPLAINING THE NEED FOR THIS TRANSITION AND THIS FEE. IT SEEMS AS IF AS WE AS CONSUMERS OF ALL FROM LAND LINES INTO CELLULAR LEAVE USE THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR THIS P. AND WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT. SURE YEAH THE EXISTING FEE STRUCTURE IS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF NOT LESS THAN A HALF A PERCENT NOT MORE THAN THREE QUARTER PERCENT. IS ASSESSED ONLY ON INTEREST STATE VOICE COMMUNICATION SO. WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER TIME AS PEOPLE OF TRANSITION AWAY FROM THOSE KIND OF VOICE COMMUNICATION ACCESS LINES IS THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S BEING COLLECTED HAS DECLINED STEADILY -- THE LAST ACTUAL SO FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND THAT FEE OLLECTED ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN REVENUE WHERE IS THE KIND OF BASS LINE ON GOING -- EXPENDITURES FOR THE NINE ONE PROGRAM ARE RIGHT AROUND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS SO. WE'VE BEEN HAVING TO DO OTHER THINGS OR DEFER COSTS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE CAPS NET IS A A PROGRAM ARE PROP PROJECT THAT IS CONVERTING OR DIGITAL. MICROWAVE SYSTEM ARE SORRY FOR ANALOG MICROSYSTEMS TO DIGITAL -- WE HAD TO DELAY THAT PROJECT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT FUNDING IN SET NOW TO PAY FOR IT -- AND SO THIS WILL HELP SUPPORT THAT TRANSITION -- WILL ALSO PROVIDE A LONG TERM STABLE FUN SOURCE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE DON'T CONTINUE TO HAVE FUNDING SHORTFALLS FROM SENATE -- TO SUPPORT THAT ONE PROGRAM -- HAVING WORKED IN A NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW ADDING TEXT MESSAGES OR FACE TÃ¢M FACE TIME MAY. ALLOW ENABLE SOME OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH EMERGENCIES. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS. PROBABLY A MORE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH SUBCOMMITTEE TO THESE FUNDS GO THROUGH. AND WHO DO I WORK WITH HERE TO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING FOR COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. IT IS BECAUSE YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER -- FIVE SO IS THE NUMBER WEBER. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY SIGNAL THE COMMENTS. THE PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN RESOLUTION MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF SB -- NINETY SIX WHICH WOULD PROVIDE FAIR US A STABLE FUNDING FOR DEBT CURRENT AYE ONE SYSTEM SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT AT THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COULD HAVE INTENSELY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATIONOF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THE STRIP ABOUT. THANK YOU SEE NO ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT LET'S GO DO SB. NINETY SEVEN SO SB NINETY SEVEN MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES IN THE TRAILER BILL RELATED TECH CANNABIS AND CANNABIS REGULATION. THE FIRST IS THAT IT AUTHORIZES LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE CITATIONS AS WELL AS ADMINISTRATIVE FINES FOR ANY VIOLATIONS. A SECOND EIGHT EXTENDS THE REPEAL DATE FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSE PROVISIONS TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IT ALSO EXTENDS THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION -- AND THIRD IT ENHANCES THE CANNABIS LOCAL EQUITY GRANT PROGRAM -- THROUGH A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS AND I'LL JUST MENTION ONE IT AUTHORIZES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. ON BEHALF OF THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL -- TO AND MISTER PROVISIONS FOR THE REVIEW IN GRANTING A FUNDING FOR THESE CANNABIS EQUITY PROGRAMS BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN THIS BILL AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. MISS LEAVE OUT. THANK YOU CHAIR I WANT TO START OFF BY AT ACTUALLY THINKING OR ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR BEING SO THOUGHTFUL AND ENGAGING SEVERAL MEMBERS -- SEVERAL WHO ARE NOT ACTUALLY HERE -- ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONSIDER AT HOW WE AS A STATE CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- VOTED FOR A AND MOVING THIS FORWARD BUT CERTAINLY AS A LOOK AT WHAT SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS ARE -- IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL THERE ARE A FEW ITEMS SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY ITEM SIX AND TEN THAT THAT I I I WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND -- IT'S IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE ARE DISTRICTS ARE IN VERY DIFFERENT PLACES WHEN IT COMES -- TO CULTIVATION LIGHT MANUFACTURING AND SALE -- OF CANNABIS -- ALTOGETHER AND AS A DISTRICT AND THAT REPRESENTS CULTIVATION AND WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THESE TRADE OFFS ARE. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE IS SPECIFICALLY RELATED -- TO THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION ON THE FACT THAT WE REMOVE A PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS -- FOR THAT. COOL I WILL SPEAK TO THAT. MANUFACTURING OR DESPITE OUR OUR SALES BUT I WILL SPEAK TO CULTIVATION WHEN WE ARE LEARNING THAT THERE ARE AT AND REALLY MEANINGFUL TRADE OFF SPECIFICALLY -- IN MY DISTRICT AROUND AGRICULTURE -- THAT THOSE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTS REVIEW PROCESS -- HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT -- WELL NOT ALL AGRICULTURAL COUGH CROPS AND MISSION THE SAME WAY AND SO WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES COME UP -- I WOULD SAY OVER THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTIC PIECES THAT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- THAT WE HAVE A IN CULTIVATION AND THEY ALSO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ABUSES IN THE LICENSING PROCESS. AND SO I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO ENSURE THAT ONE WE MEET THAT DESIRE AND THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT TO THAT WE ALSO PROTECT ALL OTHER ECONOMIC ENGINES FOR OUR COUNTY IN PARTICULAR WITH ADD PESTICIDES DON'T MIX -- THE SPACE BETWEEN CROPS ON THE MATTERS TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE RELATED TO ORDER OKAY HAS BEEN FOR OTHER CROPS AND NOT NECESSARILY CANNABIS TO THINGS ARE NOT NECESSARILY WORKING. IN THE WAY THEY HAVE SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR ENFORCEMENT THE RESOURCES ALSO TO DEAL -- WITH -- THESE ISSUES THAT ARE QUICKLY ARISING PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT THAT THE SEQUENCE EMPTION AND THE PERFECT -- TEMPORARY PERMITS GO THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO FROM MY LOOK IF IN TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE LEARNED THIS MUCH I JUST WONDER AM IF EXTENDING IT ANOTHER SIX YEARS -- WITHOUT A PUBLIC -- PROCESSES -- TO TO REVIEW THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WHAT ELSE ARE WE GONNA LEARN AND WHAT KINDS OF HARDSHIPS ARE WE PLACING ON MUNICIPALITIES WHO HAVE. FOLLOWED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE ON IN OUR EXCEEDING I THINK THE EXPECTATION. SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A FEW IMPORTANT POINTS THAT REALLY THAT INTENTION HERE BEHIND THAT PROVISIONAL LICENSE AUTHORITY IS TO BE USED AS A STEP UP LICENSE. AND REALIZING THAT WERE IN A MARKET THAT'S IN TRANSITION -- IT'S STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE IS -- AS IT RELATES TO SEE WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THAT IF IT'S NOT COMPLETE THAT NEEDS TO BE UNDER WAY. IT ALLOWS THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO REVOKE OR SUSPEND SOMEONE'S LICENSE IF THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY AND DILIGENTLY PURSUING -- ANYA LICENSURE WHICH WOULD BE COMPLETION OF SEA QUEST -- BUT THIS IS PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY THAT RELIES DEFINITELY ON THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN SOME WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFINITELY THE KEEPERS OF THE SEQUEL PROCESS -- BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS DOESN'T REMOVE ANY LOCAL -- JURISDICTION DISCRETION SELF LOCAL JURISDICTION CHOOSES TO REQUIRE COMPLETION OF C. BUT BEFORE -- GETTING A PROVISIONAL LICENSE THAT THAT IS STILL ALLOWABLE UNDER THIS TRAILER BILL -- OR ANY OTHER LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT THEY CHOOSE -- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- ARE STILL KIND OF WORKING THROUGH HOW TO INCORPORATE -- COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY INTO THEIR EXISTING SEQUEL PROCESS AND THAT THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS THAT ARE ALREADY TAKING PLACE ON SOME OF THESE BUSINESS OPERATORS AS THEY WOULD ANY OTHER BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY DOING -- THE LEAD AGENCY AND LOOKING AT DISCRETIONARY VIEWS FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS SO I BELIEVE THAT STILL ALLOWS FOR THAT DISCUSSION SOME REVIEWS ARE TAKING PLACE -- AND ADD THAT WE AREN'T REMOVING ANY DISCRETION FROM THE LOCALS TO SORT OF REQUIRE FURTHER -- SEQUIN DILIGENCE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY PREFER. AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE NOT REMOVING DISCRETION I GUESS I JUST THE PART I DIDN'T HEAR IS WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE WE PUTTING IN PLACE FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO DEAL WITH THE TRADE OFFS. OF WHAT IS -- NOW ISSUES BETWEEN AGRICULTURE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AIR QUALITY -- I MEAN PESTICIDES BRAIN I HAVE A LIST ON IN ADDITIONALLY WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE YOU PUTTING IN PLACE HERE FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO DEAL WITH THE ABUSE OF THE PROCESS. AT THE LIGHTS TEMPORARY LIKE SO WITH SO AGAIN THAT THE THE THE POWER TO REMOVE SOMEONE FROM LICENSURE STILL WITHIN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS POWER SO THEY MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT THOSE FACTORS. ARE CREATING -- SOME LOCAL HAZARDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY REMOVING LICENSURE FROM SOMEONE THEY CAN BY THE STATE AND WE CAN -- SUSPEND OR REVOKE THEIR LICENCE ENTIRELY SO THAT'S DEFINITELY A PROTECTION IT ALSO SPECIFIES AGAIN -- THAT THEY NEED TO BE -- THE INDIVIDUALS NEED TO BE WE DILIGENTLY ACTIVELY PURSUING THE COMPLETION OF THEIR ANNUAL LICENSE SO THE HOPE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY THAT IF PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING A PROVISIONAL AND NOT DOING ANYTHING THEN THEY CAN -- BASICALLY HAVE THEIR LICENSE REMOVE SO AND I THINK THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS THAT SOME OF THE WHAT'S TAKING PLACE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WAS DONE THROUGH THE TEMPORARY LICENSE PROCESS AND THE PHASE THAT WE'RE MOVING INTO IS NOT TEMPORARY LICENSES. IT'S PROVISIONAL ANY ANY LICENSES THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR ANNUAL LICENSE FEE REGARDLESS OF WHAT CATEGORY THERE AND THAT THE FOLLOW ALL ANNUAL LICENSE REQUIREMENTS. THEY HAVE TO BE IN TRACK AND TRACE -- SO IT IS A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LICENSE THAT REMOVING TO IN THIS IN THIS SPACE AND SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE I SUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE. UNDER THIS NEW STRUCTURE THAT WERE WERE SORT OF ACTUALLY IN THE MIDST OF AND THAT WERE IN PLACE EVEN TWELVE MONTHS AGO. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I WOULD ASK US. TO DO YOU CAN DIG DEEPER A LITTLE BIT DEEPER BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHILE THE INTENT IS THERE -- I AM NOT SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO MANIFEST ITSELF IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY DOES EVERYTHING THAT IS INTENDED. TO DO FOR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES I THINK AGRICULTURE IS A VERY BIG PART OF OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY CANNABIS IS PART OF IT -- BUT WE WANT ALL CROPS TO BE ABLE. TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT DOESN'T DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT AND WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT IT AND I HOPE THAT AND AS DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- THAT WOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT DEEPER THE INTENT IS THERE AND I'M NOT GOING TO ARGUE THAT BUT I DON'T SURE THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT IT'S MANIFESTING ITSELF IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FOLLOWING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE -- AND IN DOING SO TO A GREAT EXTENT THANK YOU IN JUST TWO LAST POINTS ON THIS THAT ARE ACTUAL AND ORIGINAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DID NOT HAVE A SUNSET ON THE LANGUAGE SO WE HAVE AGREED TO A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CENTS AT AND WE HAVE AGREED THAT -- TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CLARITY ABOUT WHAT SEQUEL UNDER WAY MEANS SO WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE PEOPLE THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND ADDRESS ANY -- ENVIRONMENTAL -- PROBLEMS THAT THEY MAY BE CREATING AND I APPRECIATE THE THE CHANGES I ALSO THINK THAT I GO BACK TO TO TO A COMMENT THEY MADE THE IN TWELVE MONTHS -- BUT WE'VE LEARNED A LOT IN THE STATE ABOUT WHAT IS NOT WORKING AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE REASON -- AND THE TIMELINE FOR HOW LONG WE'RE GOING TO EXTEND THIS PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO BE LEARNING MORE SO IF WE LEARNED THIS MUCH IN TWELVE MONTHS I SUSPECT THAT WE'RE GONNA LEARN DUBLIN IN. ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS AND SO THE LONGER WE PROJECT THAT AL ON THE MORE REAL LEARN AND I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO BE IN A POSITION TO EMPOWER OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS THAT ARE COMING. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE ADMINISTRATION -- FOR BRINGING THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD THE UNDERGROUND MARKET AS WE ALL KNOW AS A HUGE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THIS BILL WILL GO A LONG WAY IN ENFORCING THE LAW -- MY CONCERNS -- ARE THAT THE TAXES THAT WE WERE PROMISED WE'RE GOOD AND GOING TO BE GENERATED WITH CANNABIS ARE NOT BEING PRODUCED AND I THINK THAT THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A HUGE PROBLEM -- SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH MISTER MOM THAT WE NEED TO LOOK FURTHER. AS TO AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE IT -- I THINK WE'RE PIECE MILLING A LOT OF THE ENFORCEMENT -- ISSUES I I KNOW SOME CITIES DON'T HAVE -- THE CAPABILITIES. TO ENFORCE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES SO I THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO PLAY A BIGGER PART IN THE ENFORCEMENT PARTS I JUST. AGAIN WHEN I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FROM BRING IT FORWARD BUT I AGREE WITH MR ONE WE HAVE TO KEEP -- DIGGING AND LOOKING AT FURTHER ENFORCEMENT OPTIONS NOT JUST FOR THE STATE BUT FOR THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JONES ARE. AND I ALSO AGREED THAT THE THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS REALLY WHAT'S KILLING US AND I COMMEND IN THIS BILL THAT WERE ACTUALLY. PROVIDING SOME -- SOME PENALTIES FINANCIAL PENALTIES INSTEAD OF A GOING BACK TO THAT OLD METHOD OF ARRESTING EVERYONE FOR FOR USING CANNABIS WE'RE LOOKING AT IF YOU'RE LICENSEES FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND IF YOU'RE ON LICENSE AND THAT THOSE MONIES. HOPEFULLY WILL GO INTO THE CAMPS CONTROL FUNNY CAMPUS PRIZE IN THESE FUN IN IN ONE DAY WE LOOK UP AND THERE'S THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE MONEY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHICH I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR FOR THE LAST -- TO BUDGET CYCLES TO GIVE LIKE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CASH TO GO INTO COMMUNITIES WORK WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SHUT DOWN -- THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY -- I FIRMLY BELIEVE IF WE START MAKING THIS FINANCIALLY A DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGAL MARKET -- THOSE NUMBERS WILL GO DOWN FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT HIM IN MY AREA IN LOS ANGELES THERE'S ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY LEGAL TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED ILLEGAL -- DAY ABOUT IT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY IF YOU FIND EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM. WE GET THAT NUMBER UP PRETTY HIGH AND PEOPLE START LOOKING AT THAT FINES AND FEES. ACCOUNT. AND SO HOPE WE CAN REPURPOSE THAT. INTO COMBAT IN IT AND HOPE WE DON'T USE IT FOR OTHER THINGS OTHER THAN COMBATING CANNABIS AND SO -- I COMMEND YOU ON ON DOING THAT -- IN ADDITION. IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WE HAVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EQUITY PIECE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN -- DAMAGE BY THE CAMPUS MARKETING BEING ARRESTED -- NOW CAN USE THIS IS DOES INDUSTRY THEY CAN NOW BE PART OF IT I'M TIME I HAVE COMMITTED LATINOS WHO. WERE INCARCERATED FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN OUR OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN TOTALLY DAMAGED BY WE CAN TAKEN OUT. GOING TO THIS MARKET AND WE HAVE A VEHICLE FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE -- MANAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WHICH IS REALLY GOOD THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S IN CHARGE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND IN ON ITEM NUMBER TWELVE I WOULD ONLY CAUTION YOU -- YOU WANTED EXTEND SOME CONTRACTS TO THE TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT HEALTH SERVICES -- FOR YOUTH PROGRAM FOR USE THAT OR DID DESIGNED TO EDUCATE AND PREVENT THEM. BUT YOU WANT TO I GUESS BASICALLY -- I HAVE THEM IN -- CONTRACTS WOULD NOT A LOT OF OVERSIGHT OR LET US KNOW RETURN ON INVESTMENT HOW THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR MONEY WHERE THE NOT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THEY GIVE THAT MONEY. TO THAT THEIR EFFECTIVE. LOOK I'M A FORMER BUREAUCRAT YOU DON'T GIVE ME MONEY YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO COME BACK TO YOU AND LET YOU KNOW HOW I SPENT IT. WE ARE NOT SPENT WISELY AND MOST IMPORTANT WHEN I WAS THE BEST USE OF THOSE FUNDS SO I I WOULD CAUTION YOU NOT TO JUST. ALLOW. THE DEPARTMENT YOU JUST USED TO MONEY AT THEIR AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE AND THEN FINALLY HAVE A KIND OF A QUESTION ON THE CANVAS ON NINE ONE FIVE TWO KENNETH TO CONTROL APPEALS PANEL -- WHICH WILL BE ESTABLISHED I DO NOT UNDERSTANDING. WHY YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM CLOSE SESSIONS -- AUTHORIZED A PANEL TO HOLD A CLOSED SESSION FOR THE PURPOSE OF HOLDING A DELIBERATIVE CONFERENCE. LOOK WE HAVE GRAND JURIES TO HAVE CLOSE SESSIONS AND WHEN IT COMES -- TO USE OF FORCE IN OTHER THINGS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN A SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS MEANS THAT. YOU HAVE PRIVATE MEETINGS. WHERE NOBODY CAN COME IN AND SEE WHAT THE CANNABIS CAN CONTROL APPEALS PANEL IS DOING OFFICE TRANSPARENT ENOUGH SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS DENIED? AN APPEAL OR IF THEY GET IT THE PUBLIC WILL KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN THOSE THOSE COMMITTEE ME SO I GET SOME CLARIFICATION ON WHAT THAT MEANS I'M HOPING IT'S NOT LIKE A TO JURY. WHERE WE SHOULD GO IN SECRET AND MAKE DECISIONS? YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHANGE ITS TECHNICAL IN NATURE THE ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL APPEALS PANEL HAS THE SAME AUTHORITY IT WOULD JUST ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THOSE CLOSED. DOOR DISCUSSIONS TO DELIBERATE AND SEEMS TO THAT SOMETHING COMMON OF BOARDS SO THE CLOSEST SESSIONS -- FOR MAYBE DEALING WITH THE LAWYERS COMING IN -- LEGAL MATTERS TO TO SHOULD TALK OUTSIDE IN THE PUBLIC THAT DOES THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OKAY. THANK [inaudible] THIS RACE. THANK YOU MISTER. I WANT TO LEND MY VOICE TO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMB ON REGARDING THE SEQUEL EXCEPTION. IT IS A SERIOUS CONCERN -- AND I'M NOT SURE THAT. BUT I HAVE A HANDLE ON EXACTLY WHAT THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO BE. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF WAREHOUSES IN OUR DISTRICT AND THE SEEK. PROCESS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND EVEN WITH THAT. WE ARE STILL THE WAREHOUSE CAPITAL. OF THE WORLD. I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE. A USED AS A LOOPHOLE. TO ALLOW. THESE WAREHOUSES TO COME INTO A COMMUNITY. USUALLY COMMUNITIES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES -- ALREADY PLAGUING THEM TO KNOW A LOT ALLOW. INDUSTRY RELATED TO CANNABIS TO USE THAT EXEMPTION. TO FOREGO THE SEQUEL A PROCESS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO BE SURE. THIS IS NOT THIS IS INCORRECT. SO I THINK I THINK AS I ARE TAKE YOU LATER THAT THAT REALLY THE SEQUEL PROCESS IS STILL -- OWNED AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS PROVIDE FOR ALLOWANCES TO KEEP PEOPLE IN LICENSURE. SO IF A LOCAL JURISDICTION IS IN THE MIDST OF DETERMINING HOW THEY DEFINE -- COMMERCIAL CANNABIS SYKORA-- AND THEY HAVE THEIR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS AND THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE AN OPERATOR THAT'S YOU DILIGENTLY WORKING TOWARDS -- LICENSURE AND COMPLETING SEQUEL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE UNDEFINED THERE -- THAT THEY DON'T WANT. TO DENY THAT PERSON A LICENSE SO THIS JUST AS AN ALLOWANCE FOR THEM TO KEEP PEOPLE ON LICENSURE BECAUSE I THINK THE ALTERNATE IS THAT IF WE MAKE THE BARRIER TOO HIGH AND WE AREN'T CONSIDERED OF WHERE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE ABOUT SORT OF THEIR SEQUEL PROCESS WE COULD HAVE. IT THAT WE JUST PUT UP TO BIGGER BARRIERS AND PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE LEGAL MARKET AND THEY COULD CONTINUE INTO THE ILLEGAL MARKET SO. I MEAN THAT'S REALLY THAT THE THE THE POLICY POINT HERE IS THAT IF IT WERE NOT A FULLY EXEMPTING PEOPLE FROM SEEK WHETHER TO THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS ARE. IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE IN PLACE HOUSE YOU HAVE TO REQUIRED DISCRETIONARY REVIEW LOCALLY FOR SITE SPECIFIC. PROJECTS SO YOU JUST YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE YOUR SEEK WHAT PROCESS ON THE ACTUAL AUTHORIZATION AT A LATER DATE. AND THE SECOND ONE IS SAYING THAT IT HAPPENED SPEAK WHAT HAS TO BE UNDER WAY FOR THE LICENSEE. AND WE ALSO HAVE A PROVISION THAT SAYS IF THE JURISDICTION TELLS US THAT THEY'RE NOT DILIGENTLY ACTIVELY WORKING TOWARDS THAT THAT WE CAN SUSPEND AND REVOKE THEIR LICENSE. SO IT'S NOT WITHOUT WERE ASKING TO LIKE FOR FULL SEQUEL -- NON COMPLIANCE WE REALIZE THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT BUT WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A MARKET IN TRANSITION THAT NEEDS A PERIOD WHERE WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN OR PART WAY AND SO WE CAN GUIDE THEM TO FULL LICENSURE. AND IT'S A PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE LONG TERM I THINK. TO I WANT TO BE SURE. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CHAIR. I DO WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BALANCE? IN. IN THIS THIS SPACE. THAT WE DON'T GIVE MORE VALUE TO A BUSINESS ENTITY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S A BIT CANNABIS BUSINESS ENTITY. ON THE BALANCE WITH A COMMUNITY THAT IS GOING TO HAVE. THIS ENTITY IN THEIR MIDST. OUR OUR OUR COMMUNITIES ALREADY ARE OVER BURDENED IN SO MANY WAYS. AND SEEK WELL THE SEQUEL PROCESS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. FOR PROTECTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IF. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS. IS ALLOWED TO DECIDE WHETHER A CANNABIS BUSINESS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HEALTH OF THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THEY SIDE WITH CANNABIS THAT IS EXTREMELY. PREJUDICIAL TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. SO I HOPE THAT. THOSE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE AND I'M SURE THAT THEY WILL. A ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY -- MISTER CHAIR. IN THE LANGUAGE ITSELF WHERE TALKS ABOUT THE LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAM WHICH I THINK IS A LAUDABLE -- IDEA. IN ONE OF THOSE -- ONE ONE ASSISTANCE. THE ASSISTANCE IT THERE CAN BE PROVIDED. TO THOSE DEALING IN CANNABIS. IT STATES ASSISTANCE SECURING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FOR DIRECT ACCESS TO CAPITAL. IS THIS SOMETHING MORE THERE'S PROVIDE THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO OUR LOCAL -- SMALL BUSINESSES SO -- THE I MEAN THE THIS FUNDING IS SPECIFIC TO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY -- THERE ARE SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS -- AND WE ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM STARTING LAST YEAR THROUGH THE OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY SUPPLANTING FEDERAL DOLLARS AND PRIVATE DONATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE MORE GENERAL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO IT'S NOT. REFLECTED HERE BUT THIS IS VERY UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THIS INDUSTRY HAS LIMITED I KEPT ABILITY -- TO RECEIVE FINANCING THROUGH BANKS AND THROUGH THOSE TYPICAL PROCEDURE SO A LOT OF THIS YEAR IS IN A WAY TO GIVE -- THOSE LOCAL BUSINESSES AND START UP CAPITAL POTENTIALLY SO THAT THEY CAN GET INTO BUSINESS -- BUSINESS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. THAT MAKE IT UNIQUE. AND YOU USING FEDERAL FUNDING AS WELL. TODAY NOT NOT FOR THIS NOT FOR THIS CANNABIS THAT THAT'S FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS -- PROGRAM A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN EXISTENCE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. A SINGLE PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ALBERTO TO RECALL THE UP TO THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET I TRAILER BROKE. JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS YEARS AGO WAS INVOLVED IN CANNABIS BECAUSE WE SEE IT AS A I WAS HERE GROWING BURGEONING INDUSTRY. WE WANT TO SHOW THAT THE JOBS THAT ARE CREATED OR MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WITH GOOD. GOOD WAGES A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE MEMBER'S COMMENTS THERE. IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT. THE UNLICENSED UNDERGROUND OCCULT UNDERGROUND COMPANIES ARE HURTING. THE LEGITIMATE LICENSE COMPANIES SO IN PORTION OF THIS IS IT'S CRITICAL SIDE ONE OF THE CO COME TO MISTER JONES SAWYER AND HIS RUBIO. SECOND WERE ALSO VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO SOCIAL EQUITY PIECE OF OF CANNABIS IN THE IN THIS GOING INDUSTRY. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT ARE GOING. TO ASSIST AND ENCOURAGE MORE GROWTH IN THESE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPACTED BY THE PROSECUTION OF CANNABIS -- LAST FIFTY YEARS THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF OF US YEAH YOU CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE NO INTEREST IN ORGANIZING WORKERS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY UNLIKE OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE UFCW. OUR INTEREST IN THIS IS THE ONE THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM. WHICH IS CRITICAL TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE RUINED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS AND FAMILIES WERE BROKEN APART. THE SECOND THING IS. WE DO A LOT OF THE ENFORCEMENT INSPECTION IN SOME OF THE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS INCLUDING LOS ANGELES. AND WE WORRY ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY WITH THESE [inaudible] ILLICIT OPERATION SELLING CONTAMINATED PRODUCT. THAT HURTS PEOPLE. AND WE THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO GO AFTER THAT IS. THE POCKETBOOK AND SO WE APPLAUD THE ADMINISTRATION FOR COMING UP WITH THIS. THE THE HIGH FINE SO YOU CAN STOP THESE PEOPLE FROM ACTUALLY OPERATING. SO THAT'S IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CARE MARTIN ST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT HERE IN SUPPORT. I REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO THE SEQUEL PROCESS BUT WE ESSENTIALLY LOOK AT THIS BILL AS A TIME EXTENSION FOR THE SEQUEL PROCESS RATHER THAN A TRUE EXEMPTION -- OPERATORS HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE TO GET THAT PROVISIONAL ANNUAL LICENSE FROM THE STATE THAT THEY ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THAT C. CA IS UNDER WAY. AND THAT REALLY IS A SORT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS -- THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO GET THROUGH THAT PROCESS PROP SIXTY FOUR ESSENTIALLY SET UP A DUAL LICENSING SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THE STATE HAS TO ISSUE THERE -- LICENSE BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ZONING AND LAND USE PROCESS AND DEPENDING ON YOUR JURISDICTION YOU REPROACH SEE WHAT -- POTENTIALLY IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS AND THAT TAKES TIME CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN TAKE NINE MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS SO REALLY WE LOOK AT THIS AS A TOOL TO KEEP OPERATORS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKING. WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN COMPLIANCE INTO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE INSTEAD OF TRANSITIONING THEM INTO THE ILLICIT MARKET PAID PLACE AND THEN ALSO ON ON THE TAX PIECE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE INCENTIVES AND TOOLS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED. IN REGULATING I'M SO THAT WE CAN FULLY REALIZE THE TAX POTENTIAL THAT CANNABIS -- BRINGS IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE A FEW THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK OUT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE PAYING BACK BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE LOCALS ON NOTIFICATION OF WHOSE ISSUING LICENSES -- ONE BUT WE LOOK AT THIS MEASURE AS A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD AND NECESSARY STEP FORWARD TO KEEP OPERATORS THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INTO THE REGULATED MARKET PLACE. THANK YOU. MARIN BMB HALF OF THE UNITED CAN AS BUSINESS ASSOCIATION THIS AND AND I CAN THOSE BUSINESS ASSOCIATION THE LONG BEACH COLLECTIVE ASSOCIATION. THE UNITED MEDICAL MARIJUANA COALITION OUT OF SAN DIEGO THE SAN FRANCISCO CANS RETAILERS ALLIANCE. THE COACHELLA VALLEY CAN WAS ALLIANCE NETWORK. AND WE WE CLEARLY HAVE SEEN -- DISPENSERS HAS HAVE SEEN A PRO PROLIFERATION OF ILLEGAL SHOPS. AND AND IT HURTS OUR POCKET BUT BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER TO THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE COMMUNITY. A LOT I IMMIGRANTS THAT TIMES ARE WALKING INTO SOME OF THE SHOPS ARE YOU LEGAL. AND DON'T KNOW WHETHER I SHOP IS LEGAL OR ILLEGAL THEY MIGHT HAVE PUT UP ANY LEGAL SHOP ON A AYE ONLINE PLATFORM AND I'VE FOUGHT FOR EMPLOYMENT. THAT THE SHOP WITH SAM A PAY YOU CASH BECAUSE THAT'S HOW EVERYBODY PAYS IN THE INDUSTRY SO BY HAVING A LARGE ILLEGAL MARKING WHERE EXPOSING OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY -- WE NEED ENFORCEMENT PIECE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FOR THERE'S NOTHING IN STATURE RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOWS FOR AGENCIES TO COME AFTER ILLEGAL OPERATORS WE NEED THAT. ONE LAST PIECE ANY LOCAL PERMIT ANY PERMIT HAS TO FIRST BE APPROVED BY LOCAL JURISDICTION BEFORE IT'S APPROVED BY THE STATE. SO I THINK AGAIN SEEK WAS ALWAYS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS CONTROL FOR THAT THANK YOU. JASON BRYANT ON BEHALF OF THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY GROWERS ALLIANCE AND THE CAMPUS DISTRIBUTION ASSOCIATION -- WE SUPPORT THE TRAILER BILL -- FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT ALL DEFERRED THAT. COMES BUT REDUCE LANE AND WE I THINK HER SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU. HELLO ALLOW THE SAUDIS ON BEHALF OF LOCAL BUT AT THE U. S.. CAMPESINO I CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT ECHO COMES AS BEFORE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL TODAY I WANT TO PARTICULARLY NOTE THE COMMENTS MADE BY C. SACK AND THE INDUSTRY IS WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY -- TO BECOME COMPLIANT WITH C. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> AND THIS PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LOCALS IN -- COOPERATION WITH THE LAWFUL CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO COMPLETE THAT PROCESS -- WE DID ORIGINALLY SUPPORT THE IN PERPETUITY OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE WERE FINE WITH THE FIVE YEAR -- WE THINK THAT REPRESENTS A GOOD BALANCE -- ALSO WANT -- TO APPLY THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO IMPROVE AND BOLSTER ENFORCEMENT WE DO SUPPORT PARTICULARLY THE FINES AND PENALTIES IMPOSED ON UNLICENSED RETAILERS -- MY PRIOR CALLING MR PANETTA COMMENTED A LOT ABOUT THAT AND THEY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY INDUSTRY THERE IS A VERY VERY RAMPANT. SIGNIFICANT ILLICIT MARKET IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS HAS NO INTEREST IN COMPLYING WITH ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS IS NOT -- PRODUCING AND SELLING I TESTED QUALITY ASSURED PRODUCT SO THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND LASTLY CCA STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT AND SOCIAL EQUITY IT'S BEEN A CORPORATE E. FOR THE ASSOCIATION. AND WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION -- FOR THAT CONTINUED SUPPORT THANK YOU. MR TURN MEMBERS THE SUTHERLAND SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY FIRST OFF WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THEM ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOAN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES FOR THEIR COMMENTS ROUNDS HE WON THE CONCERNS THERE. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A TWO YEAR SUNSET FOR THE LOSS OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE INS IN LIEU OF THE PROPOSED FIVE YEARS WE FEEL THAT FIVE YEARS IS TOO LONG AT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE SITTING TOO MUCH AUTHORITY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE TWO YEARS IS REALLY THE IDEAL TIME LINE IN ORDER TO ENSURE BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE -- TO THAT EFFECT WITH OUR PARTNERS CAL TROUT AND TROUT UNLIMITED THANK YOU. ANALYSTS RIVERO WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND THE CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT OF A TWO YEAR EXEMPTION AND NOT. FIVE I THINK VERY MUCH. WHAT ARE WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE A OPPOSED TO LESS AMENDED -- FOR THE PREVIOUS REASONS -- THAT OUR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES HAVE STATED WE DON'T THINK THAT -- THAT FIVE YEAR TIME PERIOD IS -- SHOULD SHOULD BE WITH THE WAY TO GO WE BELIEVE A TWO YEAR PERIOD IS A LOT MORE. EQUITABLE AYE I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS BRIEFLY -- WITH SOME OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION -- TO COME TO A CONSENSUS ON THAT -- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TWO YEAR -- EXEMPTION THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF THIS TRAILER BILL REGULATING ENCOURAGING PARTICIPATION THE MARIJUANA MARKET IS DIFFERENT. THAN OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES WE SUPPORT THE BEST AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES.

FOR FELONIES AND MISDEMEANORS. THEY'RE NO LONGER ILLEGAL. WE THINK A SMALL INVESTMENT IN THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFERED THE WORST IMPACT OF PROHIBITION IS APPROPRIATE. SO THAT FAMILIES CAN TRYING TO GAIN WEALTH AND TRANSFER WELL TO THEIR CHILDREN THE NEXT GENERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE PUBLIC. OKAY SEEING NONE LET'S MOVE ON TO THE S. B. ONE OH THREE SO SB ONE OH THREE RATIFIES THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND CCPOA -- THIS CONTRACT -- WOULD BE FULFILLED UPON FUNDING APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THAT BUDGET YOUR COST OF THE CONTRACT FROM THE GENERAL FUND IS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S IF YOU INCLUDE BOTH CCPOA MEMBERS AND RELATED EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. FOR THE CONTRACT -- IT ALSO INCLUDES A 3% GS SIDE GENERAL SALARY INCREASE IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION EVERY TIME WE TALK ABOUT ANIMAL YOU FOR THIS BARGAINING UNIT. BUT KELLY CHAR IS SUPPOSED TO GIVE US A COMPENSATION STUDY SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THESE MO USE. WE STILL HAVE NOT HAD. THEIR COMPENSATION STUDY FOR THIS PARTICULAR BARGAINING UNIT AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SO -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE IT A FORM DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A FAIR COMPENSATION INCREASE WITHOUT THAT COMPENSATION STUDY CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHY. WE DON'T HAVE A STUDY. MERRY ALTERMAN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- IN THE PRIOR AMMO USE THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN ON THE MINISTRATION AND CZ PO WAY. TO MEET CAN ON THAT TIME. CONDITIONS OF HOW TO PUT TOGETHER THE TOTAL COMPENSATION STUDY AND NO AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION SEES. A ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE STUDY ALRIGHT SO HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION IF YOU GUYS CAN'T AGREE ON THE METHODOLOGY FOR COMPLETING A STUDY. TO GIVE US THE DATA THAT WE NEED [inaudible] SO I'M. IN THIS AGREEMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THE A GS SIZE THAT ARE BEING -- PROPOSED A WILL THE 3% FOR NEXT YEAR. GIVEN THE CHANGES THAT WORK -- OBTAINING INTHE FISHING OPERATIONS OF THE SYSTEM AND WHAT THEY FOCUSED TOWARDS REHABILITATION -- WE'VE FISKE AGREEMENT IS REALLY FOCUSING MOREON INCREASING THE NUMBER OF GENDER RESTRICTED POSTS AND THE ABILITY FOR WOMEN TO TRANSFER INTO A FEMALE INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS WILL BE MORE ABLE TO FOCUS ON REHABILITATION. AND AND THAT THE INSTITUTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMMING THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE UTILIZED YOU DOES UTILIZATION OF STAFF. OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE. INCREASE -- WE ARE TRYING TO DECIDE IF WE AGREE THAT IT'S A REASONABLE INCREASE THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO THAT. WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA IN A COMPENSATION STUDY THAT'S DATA THAT WE HAVE ON ALMOST EVERY OTHER ANIMAL USE THAT WE CONSIDER SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU? BEFORE YOU BRING AN ANIMAL YOU BACK TO US FOR THIS PARTY UNIT NEXT TIME PLEASE SIT DOWN AGREE ON A METHODOLOGY GET US THE DATA BECAUSE IT VERY MALE WALKING VERY WELL MIGHT BE A REASONABLE INCREASE. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO DECIDE -- WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO MAKE THE DECISION? I ALSO HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE BUDGET WE PASSED. TODAY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WHICH INCLUDED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR BARGAINING. BUT THAT WAS FOR ALL FIFTEEN OF THE ANIMAL USE THAT EXPIRE THIS YEAR AND YOU'VE JUST TESTIFIED THAT THIS SINGLE AMMO YOU IS GOING TO BE OVER I THINK WAS A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN COST SO. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THOSE FACTS? SO I BELIEVE. SO WE DIDN'T QUIT THE BUDGET DID INCLUDE AN INCREASE FOR BARGAINING UNITS I NEED TO GET I WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I NEED TO DOUBLE CHECK THE LISTINGS. OKAY THANK YOU I I CAN ACTUALLY RESPONSE I'M WE ACTUALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR THE MO YOU I'M IN LIGHT OF THE BARGAINING UNIT SIX CONTRACT. EXERCISE MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T FOLLOW WHAT YOU JUST SAID. SO I AM IN THE BUDGET THAT'S THAT'S BEING APPROVED TIME. ONCE THIS IS ADOPTED THIS WILL INCREASE THAT HUNDRED MILLION. OKAY I UNDERSTAND SO DO YOU THINK THAT THAT HUNDRED SO THIS WILL INCREASE THE TOWN MUCH. AND THIS WILL INCREASE IT BY -- ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION TOTAL. OKAY SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT FOR BARGAINING. IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY WILL BE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND THIRTY MILLION OKAY SO DO YOU THINK THAT THAT HUNDRED MILLION. IS GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT. TO COVER ALL THE OTHER FOURTEEN AND WILL USE THAT EXPIRE WE'RE STILL IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH ALL OF THE OTHER BARGAINING UNIT SO I'M IT'S HARD TO TELL AT THIS MOMENT. THANK YOU.
