THOSE WHO ARE AGED- THERE'S THE MENTAL ILL OR DISABLED LAST FALL STOP COMMITTEE AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING STAFF TO LOOK MORE ABOUT HOW CCL AND DUCKS ITS OVERSIGHT OF LICENSED FACILITIES. WHAT THE START FORCED BE IMPORTANCE PERFORMED BY TCL. DURING THE UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS OF BOARD AND CARE FACILITIES ONE OPERATOR WAS FOUND TO HAVE HE SOLD A LIFE. RESIDENTS VOICED CONCERNS ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF A LARGE FACILITY THAT HAD A HIGH TURNOVER TURN OVER A FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS. AND ONE FACILITY WAS FOUND TO BE IN DESPERATE THIS THIS REPAIR WHAT IN A VEHICLE OLD WATER HEATERS AND EVEN A RABBIT. SCATTERED AROUND THE YARD WITH THE INCREASING NUMBER OF HORRIBLE PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITIES RISING HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING COST AND SOCIETAL DESIRE TO LOVE PEOPLE TO RESIDE IN A LOCATION OF THEIR OWN IN STATE ROLE IN ENSURING LICENSE FIRST THESE ARE MEETING MINIMUM FIFTIES IT'S BECOMES INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. HOW THE TENSION BETWEEN BRECHT FORSMAN TORY STANDARDS CLUB LINES MUST BE KNOWLEDGE. IN THIS HEARING WE WILL HEAR STATE REGULATORS AT THE CCL THE STATE LONG TERM CARE. OMBUDSMAN REPRESENTATIVES OF OPERATORS OF BOARD AND FACILITIES ADVOCATES FOR RESIDENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES WAS CLIENTS RESIDE IN THE SERVICE. I LIKE TO CALL MEMBERS FIRST PANEL. AND ANGELA SHORT AND PAM DEFAULTS F. YOU CAN PLEASE COME UP AND WE STAGE NAME AND. GERMANIZATION REPRESENT. I'D. SO PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW OUR- PALACE TO COMPLETE THEIR TESTIMONY AND THEN OPEN FOR QUESTIONS IF THAT'S ALRIGHT- WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHICH WE YOU PAUL- HAVE THEM. COME IN AS A THE WATCHES OF THANK YOU. GOOD% AFTERNOON I'M ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING AND BOARDED CARE FACILITIES AND I'LL BE SPEAKING TODAY FROM THE HANDOUT WHICH I BELIEVE ARE RECEIVED FROM THE. REALLY CARE LICENSING OR CCL IS A DIVISION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND FOURTH AND ENFORCING REGULATIONS. TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS IN VARIOUS TYPES OF CARE. FACILITIES LICENSED BY CCL REP PROVIDE SERVICES FOR A RANGE OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THE VERY ON TO THE ELDERLY. AS OF TWENTY NINE BELT MONITORED ROUGHLY SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND LICENSED FACILITIES AND A BOTTLE OF THESE FACILITIES. BY THE THIRD SAYS FOR NEAR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AGAINST. AS YOU'LL SEE FROM THE CHART ON PAGE ONE TYPES OF FACILITIES INCLUDE CHILD CARE ADULTS AND SENIOR CARE AND CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL CHILDCARE ACCOUNTING FOR OVER HALF ADULT AND SENIOR KERR ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. AND THEN CHILDREN DONE SHOAL BY. SAYING ANOTHER 20% SINCE AND CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL INCLUDES BOTH AUSTER FAMILY HOMES AND GROUP HOPE FOR FOUGHT WITH. OVERSIGHT OF ITS FACILITIES AS PRIME WE PROVIDED BY A LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYSTS. AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED OF THESE LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYSTS WERE LOCATED AND AROUND- IN EXCUSE ME IN THIRTY OFFICES. AND IS A- ARE THOSE EARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING FACTIONS AND INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS. TURNING TO PAGE TWO HOUSE SPEAKER A BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT SEE SALES ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND OVERSEEN FACILITIES. THOUGH ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FALL INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES PREVENTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT. IN TERMS OF PREVENTION CCL AIMS TO PREVENT NON COMPLIANCE BY CONDUCTING PRE LICENSING FACILITY VISITS BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR STAFF AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER INFORMATION ON LAWS REGULATIONS TO LICENSEES AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES. IN TERMS COMPLIANCE CCL INSURES THAT FACILITIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL LICENSING LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY CONDUCTING REGULAR INSPECTIONS BOTH MANDATE AND ANNOUNCED AS WELL AS INVESTIGATING ALL COMPLAINTS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CCL CONDUCT FOR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THESE ANNUAL VISITS AND INVESTIGATED ROUGHLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND COMPLAINTS. AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE TABLE ON PAGE TWO THE FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS VARIES BY THE TYPE OF FACILITY. FOR DON SENIOR SENIOR CARE FACILITY INSPECTIONS ARE MANDATED ANNUALLY WHEREAS FOR CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES INSPECTIONS OCCUR EVERY TWO YEARS. HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AT THE END OF THE YEAR BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY INSPECTIONS WILL ALSO BE OCCURRING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FINALLY IN TERMS. MENTAL CCL HAS SEVERAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS IT MAY USE. WHEN IT FINDS- A FACILITY IS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH LICENSING STANDARDS THESE TOOLS INCLUDE CREATING AND ENFORCING CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. ISSUING CITATIONS AND FINANCIAL PENALTY IS REVOKING ARE SPENDING A FACILITY LICENSE AS WELL AS APPOINTING A TEMPORARY FACILITY MANAGER IF A LIFE- IF OF FACILITIES LICENSE IS SUSPENDED OR REVOKED. MOVING ON PAGE THREE I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME CHANGES TO SEE SALES FUNDING AND STAFFING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS YOU'LL SEE HERE ON PAGE THREE. THE SALES FUNDING HAS VARIED OVER TIME BUT HAS BEEN INCREASING STEADILY SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WITH TOTAL FUNDING REACHING OUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SIX NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT COMING FROM THE GENERAL FUND AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT TOTAL FUNDING A CHANGE IN TOTAL FUNDING IS REALLY DRIVEN BY CHANGE IN GENERAL FUND FUNDING WHEREAS FUNDING FROM FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS AND FUNDS AS AS REVENUES FROM FEET HE IS A EXCUSE ME FEET AND PENALTY. HAVE REMAINED STEADY THE TIME. AND TURNING TO PAGE FOR. YOU'LL SEE THAT SEE SEALS TOTAL AUTHORIZED POSITIONS HAVE ALSO VARIED OVER TIME BUT HAVE BEEN INCREASING GRADUALLY SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND TOTAL AUTHORIZED POSITIONS REACHED AROUND ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYST WITH A STAFF PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS- EXCUSE ME INSPECTIONS AND INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS MAKE UP ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS. WE KNOW THAT ALL THESE ARE AUTHORIZED POSITIONS THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS FILLED AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN CECILE STAFFING VACANCY RATE WAS AROUND 10% AND THIS IS ON PAR WITH HISTORICAL AVERAGES OF STAFFING VACANCY RATE. CCL MOVING ON TO PAGE FIVE ON NOW SHIFT MY FOCUS TO BOARD AND CARE FACILITIES WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY TOPIC OF YOUR HEARING TODAY. IN GENERAL BOARDING CARE FACILITIES ARE PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES SERVING ADULTS AND SENIORS WHO CANNOT LIVE SAFELY ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT PERSONAL CARE ASSISTANCE AND NON MEDICAL CARE. TODAY MY COPS WILL FOCUS ON THE BOARDING CARE FACILITIES LICENSED BY CCL WHICH ARE ADULTS RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES OR ARTS AND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY OR ARE SEE IF YOU. THIS WAS ONLY BOTH SERVE INDIVIDUALS WITH VARYING NEEDS INCLUDING PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS AND MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IS REALLY THAT ARTS ARE SERVING ADULTS OF THOSE AGED EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHERE'S OUR SEE IF HE IS OUR SURVEY ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS EIGHT SIXTY- WE'LL SEE FROM THE TABLE PAGE FIVE. THAT THERE WERE OVER TWELVE THOUSAND ARTISTS AND OUR SEE IF USED AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY TO SERVE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. THIS WAS ALL REAL RANGE IN SIZE FROM SMALLER RESIDENTIAL HOMES WITH AROUND SIX BEDS TO LARGER ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES CAPABLE OF SERVING ONE HUNDRED RESIDENTS ARE MORE. HOW MUCH BURDEN CARE FACILITY CAN CHARGE VARIES BY THE INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS MANY RESIDENTS MAY PAY OUT OF POCKET WHILE FOR OTHERS FACILITIES CAN RECEIVE A MONTHLY REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME STATE SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS PROGRAM OR THE SS I SS P. PROGRAM. AS OF TWENTY TWENTY THE SS I AS AS AS AS P. REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PRESIDENT PER MONTH. AND TURNING TO PAGE SIX I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT SOME COMMON DEFICIENCIES AND BOARDING CARE FACILITIES. AS I NOTED EARLIER SEE SALES ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT WHEN CCL FINDS A FACILITY IS OUT OF COMPLIANCE. IT MAY SITE THAT FACILITY FOR A DEFICIENCY. AS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CCL CITED AROUND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DEFICIENCIES ACROSS OUR FACE AN RCF USE AND AS YOU'LL SEE FROM THE TABLE ON PAGE SIX THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF DEFICIENCY IS A BOTH ACROSS BOTH FACILITY TYPES WERE THE LATEST OF THE FACILITY BEING IN SAFE SANITARY AND COULD REPAIR. ALL TIMES. BUT I WILL MY COMMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AND SEVEN OUT TO MEET OUR HAVE THE NEXT TO. PLEASE ENTER. YOUR NAME AND YOUR ORGANIZATION SURE HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SCANDIC FOSSUM THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. SO I'M I'M GRATEFUL TO COME TOGETHER TO AS A COMMUNITY TO TALK ABOUT PRESERVING BEDS AS WE'VE BEEN IDENTIFYING THIS ISSUE FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS WHEN I CAME TO THIS POSITION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE BEGINNING OF SEE OF THE ROOF. YOU LAWS WERE IN AN AND- RANK IN THE ACTION IN THOSE A OF NON OF COMPROMISE HEALTH AND SAFETY- OF ARE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS PRIMARILY HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND LICENSE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES PROVIDE A SAFE SUPPORTIVE AND HEALTHY SETTING FOR THE ONE POINT FOR ME AND CALIFORNIANS. EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUAL THEIR FAMILIES RELY ON THE STATE TO OVERSEE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF LICENSED FACILITIES THROUGH FOCUSED PREVENTION EFFECTIVE MONITORING AND CONSISTENT FAIR INSURANCE FOR ENFORCEMENT CARRIED OUT BY APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN HUNDRED. STAFF WITH CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED AND THAT DON'T SENIOR CARE PROGRAM. SO THEY DON'T SENIOR KERR PROGRAM HAS APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND FACILITIES WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED STAFF THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AND COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER- ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. AND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE STATE HAD EMERGED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION CCL LIKE MANY PROGRAMS IN THE SAFETY NET SERVING BOWL CALIFORNIA HAD BEEN DECIMATED. WE THE CARRYING OUT THE BARE MINIMUM CRITICAL ACTIVE. SECTIONS OF LIFE THE LEASE A- BACK FOR ANNUAL TO EVERY YEARS USING TOOLS THEY DEVELOP TO JUST TRIAGE FACILITIES HERE ACTUALLY JUST DOING A QUICK YOU KNOW WALK AROUND THE FACILITY TO IDENTIFY THINGS- IN AND PROVIDE A FULL PICTURE OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITY. THAT'S WHEN THEY HAD DEVELOPED THE KEY AND- TOLD CALLED THE KIT. FOR DON'T SENIOR CARE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINING VESTED CATIONS TAKING OVER NINETY DAYS DURING THREE YEARS IN THIS TIME DOUBLED FROM EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY OVER NINETY SIX TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED- ACTIVITY AIMED AT HELPING- AND- THE FACILITIES MAINTAIN. COMPLIANCE AND PROVIDING INFORMATION LIKE TECHNICAL SUPPORT WERE EITHER TOTALLY ELIMINATED OR SEVERE CUT. PRIOR TO THE RECESSION THE CITY HAD ITS GOALS. ANALYSTS EVERY REGION OFFICE. THAT HAD THAT MONITORED RESIDENTIAL CARE. THE DATE WE HAVE FOUR FOR THE ENTIRE STATE BUT WE'VE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THAT TRAINING WITH OUR LIKE OUR L. PA'S TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHY THEY'RE ALL RIGHT DOING AN INSPECTION. SO THE INSPECTIONS NOW TAKING LONGER BECAUSE OF THAT BUT IF WE SEE THAT AS BEING VERY FRUITFUL FOR HELPING THESE FACILITIES BEEN COMPLY. I'LL TALK TO LITTLE MORE FURTHER DOWN. STILL IN FOR AND FISCAL YEAR FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AS I SAID WHEN I FIRST CAME ON BOARD IT WAS AN IMPORTANT YEAR FOR CCL IT MARKED THE BEGINNING REBUILDING OUR WHOLE DIVISION. THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION WERE CHANGING THE RESIDENTS WERE OLDER AND MORE DIVERSE THAT THE RESIDENTS HAD MORE COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH AND ANY MEDICAL CONDITIONS WITH CO MORBIDITIES. SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND FACILITY HE'S WITH HIS PARENTS IS CHANGING THEM MEANT CTL NOW RESPONSE I'D SPREAD DEVASTATING DISASTERS THE FIRES WE REACH OUT TO EVERY SINGLE- ASSISTED LIVING OUR CFE ARE FOR. CHILD CARE GROUP HOME FACILITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE FIRE TO. OUT TO SEE IF THEY NEED ANY US AND SO WE'VE ADDED ON. MUCH MORE COLLABORATION WITH OUR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE MORE OF A ASSISTANCE. TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WE HAVE ENGAGED IN THE EVOLUTION OF CHANGE MODIFY IN OUR DIRECTION TO INCLUDE A MORE BUS ROBUST PREVENTION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOCUS. TO PRESERVE THE CAPACITY AND ASSURE QUALITY OF COMMUNITY CARE. THAT WERE ANGELA MENTIONED THAT AND WEEK WE CALL IT THE THREE LEGGED STOOL WHICH IS PREVENTION COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THAT WE TRIED TO GIVE A MORE ROBUST TRAINING TO OUR R. L. P. A.'S WHEN I GO IN TO DO AN AND- INVESTIGATION IN A FACILITY. THE INCREASED FREQUENCY OF LICENSING INSPECTIONS FROM- FROM LESS THAN FIVE YEARS TO ANNUALLY FOR DON'T SENIOR CARE. IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE REFUSE TO ALLOW COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION NOW IN THE FACILITIES. THROUGH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE WOULD REDUCE OUR COMPLAINT BACKLOG- BY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY CASES IN THREE YEARS. WE ESTABLISHED A QUALITY ASSURANCE UNIT THE PROVIDES ACTIONABLE PERFORMANCE DATA AND PROMOTES DATA IT LITERACY. WE CREATED A CALL CENTER TO CENTRALIZE AND STANDARDIZED COMPLAIN INTAKE AND GIVE THE PUBLIC WHAT SOME NUMBER. FOUR COMPLAINTS AND GET THEM. IN ABOUT MY- OUT THEY HAVE ALL EVERY SINGLE REGIONAL OFFICE APPARENTLY AND IT WILL IT WAS. WE HAD KNOWS OR DOES. IN OF WHAT PLANES WERE COMING UNLESS WE DIDN'T. ALTHOUGH OUR FOR ARE SOCIAL MODEL MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS HAVE MENTAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICAL NEEDS NECESSITY NECESSITATING THE INTERVENTION OF CLINICAL PRACTITIONERS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE RECRUITED IN OUR AND TWO FROM THE PROPS A MINUTE THEIR FOR THE SYSTEM THIS FILM SENIOR CARE PROGRAM. AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE HIRED FIVE READ REGISTERED NURSES TO ACTUALLY- PROVIDE EXPERT CONSULTATION ON A LOW OF THE COMP MEDICAL SOCIAL ISSUES THAT WE WERE FINDING ON THESE. MONDAYS IS THE MOST. THE PRESENT TENSE BASED COMMUNITY CARE PRACTICES THEY WERE DEVELOPED FOR BOTH INTERNAL CCL STAFF AS WELL WELL AS OUR LICENSEES- THE INCLUDED IDENTIFYING CHANGES OF CONDITION BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE THING THAT WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE LICENSEE AND THERE'S MORE NOT TRYING TO KNOW. YOU KNOW A CHANGE IN CONDITION LED TO PRESSURE ULCERS- WE HAD. FALL AWARENESS- PREVENTION OF PRESSURE INJURIES AND ALTERNATIVES THE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS BECAUSE I WAS ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN. WITH THE CLINICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE SEALS FOSTERING RESIDENT CENTERED CARE RESIDENTS AND CARROTS A PERTAINS TO THE COMMUNITY RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES MEANS STAFF KNOW THE RESIDENT AND CARE AND SUPERVISION IS REALLY PROFOUND AROUND WHAT THAT RESIDENTS PRESIDENT ARE AND NOT JUST THE HOUSE THAT THEY HAVE TO DO. RESIDENT COMES INTO A FACILITY AND THAT USED TO BE NOT A AND SLEEPING TELL TAN AND HELP AND BREAKFAST LEVEL WHEN THEY COME INTO OFFICE THEY MAY HAVE SER BRECK AT EIGHT THIRTY EVERY DAY THEY DON'T. PAY AT TO WHAT THE NEEDS ARE THE OF THE REPRESENTS THE WAY TO PROMOTE RESIDENTS THAT ARE. UP IT IS AN ALL POINT IN. TO ENSURE AS AS THEIR- REFERENCES. IT CAN I TO THAT. AS EIGHT PROCESS NEW A SENSE THE CLUB FACILITIES ABLE TO MEET REST NEEDS USING OUT AGENCIES LIKE HOME HEALTH OR HOSPICE WE HAVE A- PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRO IT VRY. KEEN OF THE TALENTED CLOSE IS THAT WE IN THE NATURAL DISASTERS NUMBER THESE THAT. HOW WITH BOOTS ON THE- FACE THERE'S A VERY CLOSE PARTNER WITH. ACROSS THE STATE OMBUDSMAN OR IN THESE FACILITIES AND WILL COMMUNICATE TO US THERE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND- HOW US IN ASSISTANCE ONE ARE IS A CLOSER OF FINDING AVAILABLE BAD. CLOSER TO CRITICAL TO THIS TO MANY OF THE IN. WRITTEN INITIATIVES ENGAGE IN OR TO HELP PREVENT THE CLOSURES AND WHEN THEY HAVE- LESSEN THE IMPACT ON THE RESIDENTS. WE IDENTIFIED FACILITY CLOSERS A- THE RISING COST OF HOUSING AND OTHER BUSINESS COSTS A PLEA AMONG PLEASE OPERATE IN SMALLER MARGINS AND SERVING LOW INCOME. CALIPHATE IN. SO BURNS BECAUSE THERE WERE THERE TO FOR THE OUR FEET LIED BILLION AND EVER SINCE WE WERE USED HOW WE- IMPLEMENT THE- PARENTS THEY WERE. ALL OF THE SITE ARE LESS ON THE WEB AND THERE'S A- AN ANTI CON. THAT HAPPENED A ENSURE COMPANY USE. I AS TO INCREASE THE RATES FOR THE A LOT OF THESE FACILITIES AND SO THEY WERE UNABLE TO AFFORD THEIR LIFE ELAINE AND WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE CHECK EVERY TIME WE GO INTO A FACILITY. SO THAT IS THAT IS WHAT THE CONCERNS. ONE OF THE IT IS WITH HOUSING. I WANT SIZE THESE ARE THE RESIDENTS HOME IN A WAY THAT WERE WE TALK ABOUT IN BEGINNING. HOW THE CAN DO OF SO OF THESE HOMES. WE ALLOW THE SOME OF THAT THAT'S CONSULTANTS TO ACTUALLY GO AND SHADOW AN INVESTIGATOR AND INSPECTION THAT THERE ARE FACILITIES I WILL SAY THAT HOW THAT ARE NOT IN GOOD REPAIR- WERE IN THERE ONCE A YEAR AND THIS WELL WITH COMPLAIN INVESTIGATIONS. WE USE OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS MUCH AS WE CAN WHEN WE FAIL. IF THERE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES WE WAY THAT DIDN'T. WHAT THE ISSUES ARE AND THAT AND THE TO SEE IF HEALTH AND STATE IS WEAK WEAK- ASSIST WITH A VIOLATIONS WE HAVE. AN OF ANGELA IN THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR VIOLATION. ON SO. ANYWAY THEY THE SSI THERE WHEN YOU WALK AND SOMETIMES IT'S A SHOCK SOME OF THE CLIENTS THAT ARE IN THOSE FACILITIES THEY HAVE YOU KNOW BEHAVIORS OF FOURTEEN AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THE LICENSEES HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND SO IT DOES IMPACTS SOMETIMES WHAT THE PHYSICAL PLANT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE TRY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WITH THEM AND NOT JUST SHUTTING ON DOWN. LAST YEAR WE HAD APPROXIMATELY TWELVE HUNDRED ADULTS SENIOR CARE FACILITY CEASE OPERATION FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT SIGNIFICANT WE STILL HAVE ENOUGH BEDS IN THE STATE WE HAVE NEVER CLOSE TO FACILITY AND NOT HAVE A PLACE TO RELOCATE A RESONANT. BUT IT IS IT IS CONCERNING THAT THE NUMBER THAT ARE CLOSING. I'M MORE NOTIFIED OF A POTENTIAL CLOSER WE CONDUCT THE VISIT OF THE FACILITY WE HAD TO WE REQUIRE THAT THE LICENSEE TO ATTEND A MEETING HELD AT THE REGIONAL OFFICE. TO TALK ABOUT THEIR CLOSER PLAN AND WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS- WE CONTACT OUR PARTNERS SUCH AS THE REGIONAL CENTERS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OMBUDSMAN PUBLIC GUARDIAN TO HELP US LOCATE BEDS APPROPRIATE BEDS FOR THE RESIDENTS. AFTER RELOCATION WE CONDUCT THE WELFARE VISIT WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OF ALL RELOCATED RESIDENTS TO ASSURE THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE ADVOCATES FOR THE RESIDENTS IN THE PROVIDER ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE FACILITIES CANNOT BE UNDERSCORED ENOUGH. WE WORK CLOSELY ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES THAT IMPACT THE QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS INCLUDES UPDATING REGULATIONS WHERE WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON DEMENTIA INCIDENTAL MEDICAL AND DENTAL UNIFORMS TESTAMENT TOOL AND BROWN'S- STAFFING RATIOS. AND IDENTIFYING PRIORITIES FOR SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT WITH ALL OF THESE CONCERNS IT REALLY. IS IMPORTANT THAT WERE ALL AROUND THE TABLE AND LOOKING AT THE BEST AND- ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE RESIDENTS. IN CLOSING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF LICENSING HAS BEEN WORKING WITH AND CURRENT RESOURCE TO BUILD A STRONG FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT OUR MISSION. NOW IN THE FUTURE THE CURRENT ISSUE OF CCL HAS ENGAGED IN THE AREAS OF STATUTORY REGULATORY REFORM. US REMEMBER GAGE WAS STAKEHOLDERS COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE REBUILDING STAFF DEVELOPMENT AND EMPOWERMENT FOSTERS THE FULL OF COOPERATION PREVENT DISTANCE A STEP BACK. THE BACK IN MEN. THE END OF A- AND- FOR. ALL CAN COMMITTEE READ. FACILITIES WE I HAVEN'T ABOUT THE INS TOLL THAT WE THE THAT IS MUCH OF A MUCH MORE WERE. TOOL TO REALLY ABOUT THE MEASURE OF THE FACILITY THAT MEETS ALL OF THE REGULATIONS SO I PROVIDED YOU WITH A LITTLE HAND OUT- TO TERROR AND THAT SHE CAN KIND OF SHOW THIS IS WHAT THE TOOL- INCLUDES SO IT INCLUDE. WE GO THROUGH INSTEAD OF. JUST LIKE A WALK THROUGH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HITS ALL OF THEM STORY OF THE REGULATORS OR AT LEAST A PIECE OF ALL THE REGULATIONS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL I'LL ASK. THE SOUL. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. LANCE THANK YOU ALL FOR START UP THE- QUESTIONS- WILL GO AHEAD AND START FIRST AND ASKED TWO QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL THE FIRST ONE I KNOW THAT YOU JUST TO BRIEFLY TOUCHED ON THE INSPECTION THE NEW INSPECTION TOLD TO UP WHAT IS IT. WHAT IS THE STAFF SPONSOR THAT TODAY TOOL I'M THE STAFF- YOU KNOW IT'S STILL NEW TO THEM IT'S JUST BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR SENIOR CARE AND ADULT CARE WILL BE AND IMPLEMENTED- IN. MARCH SO. WE HAD A LOT OF THAT THE ACTUALLY THE LPS THAT DO THE INSPECTIONS WORK WHEN WE WERE DEVELOPING THE TOOLS SO THEN WE WOULD HAVE THEM TESTED ME WOULD GET FEEDBACK FROM THEM IS THERE THAT THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE LICENSEES NO AND OUR STAFF KNOW IT TAKES LONGER SO IT TAKES LONGER BUT YOU'RE GETTING YOUR GETTING A SENSE OF THE QUALITY CARE NOW WE COULD GO IN THERE AND COME IN AND OUT CHECK OUT THE BOX THAT WE DID OUR ANNUAL INSPECTION THE KIT. I'M NOT WE WERE LESS TYPE OF. IT'S GOING. YOU KNOW EVERY TIME WE WOULD GO BACK GET A COMPLETE LIKE THEY DIDN'T UNDER THAT THE REGULATIONS SO THE WAY THE TOOL IS DEVELOPING IS THE LPA ACTUALLY GOES OVER THE REGULATION SO THEY UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS SO- WE GOT WE DID A SURVEY A WEEK LEFT TO SURVEY WITH THE LICENSEE FOR EVER THAT WE DID WE DID A SURVEY IN THE PILE. SO WE GOT FEEDBACK FROM THE LICENSEES. SO WE TOOK THAT. CAN WE CAN'T MODIFY MODIFY MODIFY. AND WE FINALLY YOU KNOW PUT PENS DAY IN THIS IS THE START. SO WE HAD TO DEVELOP A- TOOL FOR ALL EVERY FACILITY TIED IN ARM IN ARM THE VISION. SO WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO EVERYONE AT ONE TIME BECAUSE IT'S IT TAKES A LOT OF THE POLICY STAFF TO LOOK GO TO ALL OF THE REGULATIONS AND- BECAUSE WE DEVELOP. I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO THE WEEDS BUT THERE'S DOMAINS THROUGHOUT THE TOOL THAT ARE THAT ARE. AT THAT ARE REAL TO REBELS ELATION SO YOU'RE BEING. YOU ALL OF THE CALLS IN THE REGULATE IN THE STOOL. SO WHERE CONSTRUCT. BACK FROM THE LAB AND THE AND OURS. OUR STAFF YOU ARE STILL BE USED TO IT IT'S TAKEN LONGER WE FEEL AFTER THEY'VE USED IT FOR A WHILE THIS IS NEW TO THEM. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH IT SINCE WE'VE JUST STARTED THIS IN NOVEMBER WITH. WAS SENIOR KERR WE'RE WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY TO SEE AND YOU KNOW IF FOR IDENTIFYING AND EFFICIENCIES. THANK AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION THAT I KNOW YOU TOUCHED ON A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THE IN THE YOU HAVE. HE TELLS BUT MORE BY THE FIRST THESE ARE ARE WAS SENT OUT- PREFERRED OVER TO YOUR NET SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY REFERRED THEY CAN'T SELF. SUBSCRIBE TO THE LICENSE SO IT ACTUALLY. TO BE- SUBMITTED FROM THE L. P. A.'S AFTER THEY'VE BEEN IN THE FACILITY AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEYOND. WHAT THE EPA HAS TIME TO DO BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TEACHING THE LPS ACTUALLY GIVE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN THEY'RE THERE ON SITE WHEN THEY CAN. IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S MORE ADVANCED- THEN THEY THEY RECRUIT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YOU KNOW BUT LIKE I SAID WE ONLY. FOR THE STATE AND IT MAKE VERY BUSY. WHAT A- BAD. WELL IF LIKE WE- OF. SAMPLE ONE CASE A OF THE- AND- STOCKTON. WAS JUST COULD NOT GET RID OF BED BUGS AND THERE'S BED BUGS AND A LOT OF THE LOWER INCOME FACILITIES. IT'S NOT THAT YOU CAN JUST BROKE OUT PEST CONTROL AND GET RID OF IT SOMETHING THAT YOU CONTINUALLY HAVE TO WORK ON. WHEN THE RESIDENTS ARE FREE TO COME AND GO- INTO AN ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES YOU KNOW THEY COME BACK AND SO. OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ANALYST ACTUALLY WENT OUT THERE AND DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THESE THEY'RE CALLED HOT BOXES THAT THEY COULD PUT LIKE THEIR SHOES AND THEIR- SOCKS AND WHEN THEY CAME BACK. SO THE AND THEY WERE FAIRLY INEXPENSIVE FOR THE- THE SILLY SO I MEAN THAT THEY DID THAT- THEY THEY- THEY LOOK AT WHATEVER THE VIOLATIONS ARE AND- THEM UNDERSTAND THIS IS WHAT. WE DO TO REMEDY TO ASIAN LOT OF THE LEAST OF THE- IS THE COULD ROUGH NEEDS WERE. THE KEEP PASS UP THE REALLY NEED WHOLE NEW THEY DO DON'T HAVE FINANCE FOR IT BUT- IT THEY CALLED AND- TRAINING OF MEDIC. THEY THEY HOW THEY OF. STORE MEDI I'M DEPENDS ON WHAT ISSUE IS IN THERE HAVE WE GUY THAT ARE TECHNICAL UNIT DRAFT THAT WE PUT ON OUR WEBSITE FOR OUR PROVIDERS AND- THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ANALYST ACTUALLY GO OUT THERE WITH THE RESOURCE GUIDE GIVE IT TO THEM AND SHOW THEM THIS IS WHAT HOW YOU CAN DO IT IF THEY THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE RECORDS HOW THEY THEY- THE DOOR THEIR EFFORTS FOR THEIR STAFF OR THEIR OR THEY'RE AND MET THEIR- RESIDENT. THEY HELP JENNIFER THIS IS YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW THE ACTUALLY WORK WITH THEM TO SET IT UP CORRECTLY. WELL THANK YOU I DO A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AND I SAW. A CENTER PAN FOR FREE AND. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION- SO IN TERMS OF. THE BOARDING CARE FACILITIES THANK YOU MADE REFERENCE THAT ACTUALLY ARE WE LOSING NUMBER A DECREASING YOU SAID YOU THERE ARE SEVERAL BECAUSE I AM TRYING GET SENSE OF LIKE. CLOSER VERSES OPENINGS. OKAY SO WE'RE- WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY- WHICH- TO PUT IT. I'LL JUST PUT IT REALLY THINK WE THAT OUR BY OUR CAPACITY IS VERY MUCH THE SAME IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS OKAY TO THE LETTER BUT BASS CITY WERE NOT BUT THE SSI BEDS WERE SEEN OUR BEING THOSE OF THE FACILITIES THAT ARE SHUTTING DOWN IT'S GETTING THE COST OF LIVING THE RANTS. OF THE COST OF INSURANCE OF THAT OUR ART IN SO WE'RE REALLY DOING AN ANALYSIS RIGHT NOW TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WE'VE SENT SURVEYS OUT TO THOSE THAT CLOSED IN THE LAST YEAR TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WHY THEY CLOSED AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE DO TALK TO THEM BUT WE HAD WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE HAVE A CAPTION THAT IN THE DAY THIS IS. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT CLOSELY BUT BUT THE OF THE SIDE BAD ONES THERE SUFFERING AND TRYING TO OPEN SO IF. A LOOK AT THE- THERE. CLOSE TO FIND A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. THERE YOU KNOW THEY WORK FOR CHANGE OF ON. YOU KNOW IF YOU SIXTY BEDS THAT THAT'S- THAT. AND SMALL. AND SO WE'RE WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY WE CANNOT IDENTIFY BASED ON OUR DATA SYSTEM BUT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT HOW MANY SSI CLIENTS WE HAVE WERE WERE WE GET DATA FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OF EVERY CLIENT THAT THEY'RE PAYING CLAIMS ON WITH SSI AND WE MATCH OUR ADDRESSES SAUDIS BUT YET STAFF OR THAT ARE LIVING FACILITIES THE OWNER SO THESE THEY COULD BE THERE YOU KNOW. COUNTING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE COLLECTING US AS THE- AND IT COULD BE STAFF SO WE DON'T HAVE A SOLID NUMBER ON IT WE JUST HAVE A BALL PARK BUT WE'RE WORKING TO SEE HOW WE CAN REFINE THAT. A AND THEN. SO BASICALLY WE'RE LOSING SSI BAGS I USE THAT AS A MASTER RACE OKAY SO THAT THE BIGGER PRIVATE FACILITIES ARE OPENING UP SO THE BEDS ARE LIKE CAPTURED WHEN YOU LOOK HURDLE CAPACITY IN THE STATE IT'S NOT SHOWING THE UTTERANCE BUT IS ESSENTIALLY IT'S BEEN LEVEL FOR THE LAST FOUR. HAVE PASS THE RIGHT. OKAY I'M AND I WOULD MAKE NO THAT PART AND OUR POPULATION'S AGING SO THE THAT. SO YOU THINK THAT THE ACTUAL DEMAND FOR THESE IS ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH OUR CAPACITY IS THE SAME AS ACTUALLY GOING UP IS THAT. AND IT'S I MEAN I DON'T WANNA STAYS EXACTLY THE SAME IT KIND OF GOES FLUCTUATES GOES UP A LITTLE BIT THIS YEAR AND THEN DOWN WELL AND SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT IS IF YOU LOOK OUT TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS YEAH. ARE YOU YEARS. WHAT WHAT WERE WE IN TURN OF OUR- TO PROVIDE CARE. AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PEOPLE THEY CAN'T FIND A- THE BAD THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT VERY CLOSELY WHERE WE ARE NOT CLOSE TO THAT YEAH THAT WILL IT IS SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE OF THE- BREVITY OF HOW MANY ARE CLOSING OKAY SO RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. FIND IN A BAD FOR ADDRESS AYE CLIENT BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE IS WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT WE CAN TO PRESERVE THESE FANS TO HELP THEM FROM CLOSING. OKAY I APPRECIATE. MONITORING BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT THERE ARE SOME. OBJECTION IN PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE SO WHEN IT'S SO I KNOW WE HAVE A MASTER PLAN ON AGING GOING ON THIS THIS IS THIS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE AGENCIES BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE INPUT TO ARE NOT JUST IN. THE FLIGHT DATA FOR. YEAH THEY'VE ASKED US FOR DATA BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN FIND OTHER AVENUES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THAT SAID THEY WERE LOOKING AT OTHER. YOU KNOW I DO WE NEED TO THE STATUTE WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE WIND WHEN CAN WE IS THE LEGISLATURE EXPECT SOME SORT OF. BROOKE BUT OUR WHATEVER T. IN TERMS OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE AGENCIES LOOKING AT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR LOOKING AT AND STUDYING AT I LIKE TO HAVE A SENSE AND TIME LINE AS TO WHEN WE SHOULD BE AT YEAH BECAUSE YOU KNOW BY THERE AND WE DO AT THE MOMENT BUT WHAT THE WHEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACT. I DON'T. FROM YOUR TO. AS FAR AS SOME ANSWERS AS TO WHAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST IN TERMS OF HOW WE EXPERIENCE YEAH WHAT HAVE BEDS WE NEED AND HOW WE GET THERE. I'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON A TIME LINE I MEAN WE CAN PROVIDE. INFORMATION WE DON'T HAVE A REAL ROBUST DATA SYSTEM BUT WE HAVE WE KNOW WHAT OUR CAPACITY IS BECAUSE WE'VE- WE ARE WE ARE WE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MONTHS EARLY TALKING ABOUT THE- HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE. I MEAN WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEY'RE LOOKING AT OUT WHAT WHAT'S WHEN. I SAID I KNOW YOU I GIVE ME A PARTICULAR I DON'T BUT EATS AYE AYE WHY SAID THE SCALE OF THE TALK ABOUT NEXT YEAR WE TALKING ABOUT I WOULD. BUDGET AND I'M ON OF NEXT YEAR BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE THAT WE DON'T GO OUT AND RECRUIT PEOPLE TO APPLY THAT WE PROVIDE DATA THAT SAID. IS WHAT MORE WE'RE GOING TO WHAT WE NEED. OKAY WHAT WHAT ARE ROLE IS TO MONITOR THE FACILITIES FOR THE- COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY AND TO HELP THEM FROM GOING. OUT OF BUSINESS AND- STAND THE MASTER PLAN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT WITH A REPORT IN OCTOBER RIGHT. I GET FRANKLY EVERY GUY SHOULD WE DEAL EXPECT SOMETHING BY OCTOBER. WE'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BECAUSE THE MASTER PLAN IS NOT PART OF US THE MASTER PLAN IS SOMETHING THAT. IT WAS THE A PROPOSAL. BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE TASK.

SERVICES FOR SENIORS IS A- WARNING AREA DEFINITELY OKAY ALL RIGHT SO I HERE DEFINITELY I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THEN WOULDN'T THAT SHOULDN'T PROJECTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO IN THE FUTURE BE INCORPORATED INTO THE MASTER PLAN WHICH IS FIRST COME OUT OCTOBER I WOULD THINK SO. OKAY SO THAT MEANS OR AGENCY HOPEFULLY IS PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE COMMISSION. AND THIS WOULD AND HOPEFULLY SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMISSION BECAUSE AFTER ALL YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE DATA THAN ANYONE ELSE- IS TO HAVE WHAT KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS THEY WOULD MAKE.IN OCTOBER ATTRACT TIED. OKAY SO I WOULD HOPE THAT BY THE TIME THE MASTER PLAN CAME OUT. AT YOUR AGENCY WOULD HAVE. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY WITH NOW WHETHER ACCEPTED BY NOT BY THE COMMISSION THAT'S ABOUT A WHOLE DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT- CERTAINLY BEFORE OCTOBER CERTAINLY BY THE TIME OF OCTOBER. HOPEFULLY THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING IS GOING TO BE BOTH INFORMING THE MASTER PLAN BUT YOU COULD ALSO PERHAPS REPORT INDEPENDENTLY AS TO WHAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST TO TAKE CARE AT. IN TERMS OF PROJECTIONS AS TO WHAT I DEMANDS AND NEEDS ARE FOR. THE CARE HOMES CORRECT I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE BUT I WILL SAY THAT THESE ARE JUST THESE RECOMMENDATIONS I BELIEVE THE HOUSE.

SENATE JACKSON YEAH VERY BRIEFLY I THINK- I SHARE OBVIOUSLY DOCKED PAN HEADS IS SUBCOMMITTEE IN IS RIGHT ON TOP OF THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF IT BUT- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE. THIS IS A PROBLEM THE DAM IS ABOUT TO BREAK ON THIS ISSUE AND- WE CANNOT AFFORD ANY LEVEL OF COMPLACENCY HERE AS WE- AGAIN WE CAN ME WHAT WE HAVE TODAY BUT WITH THE- SENIOR POPULATION EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY THE END OF TWENTY THIRTY- THERE IS AN URGENCY HERE AND I JUST WANT TO. REINFORCE OF MY SENATE AND I THINK THE SHARED BY THOSE OF US IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. THIS IS WE NEED SOME VERY VERY PROACTIVE ADVOCACY. OF FROM THE AGENCIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE TASKED WITH THIS- AND WE NEED TO DO MORE PENSION SIMPLY. SO I BUT THERE IS TODAY. THERE IS HOLES I DON'T WANT SAY TSUNAMI BECAUSE I KNOW THAT TO ADVERSE WORD OR NEGATIVE FOR IT ACCORDING TO THOSE WHO. ARE PART OF THIS TSUNAMI MYSELF INCLUDED SO I WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE. SAYING THAT BUT BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE. A VERY WHERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A EIGHT MILLION SENIORS NOT ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLACE- WITH FAMILY OR- OF CONTAINED- GENERAL OPPORTUNITY SO YOU WERE GOING TO BE A MAJOR PLAYER AND I JUST HOPE THAT. AS WE GO FORWARD WE CAN HEAR SOME. SOME LEVEL OF. ENTHUSIASM OR- URGENCY AS WE DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. THEY CANNOT CAN I JUST ANSWER THAT I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW IF I PROVIDED YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT WERE JUST SITTING BACK AND GIVING NUMBERS WERE NOT THAT'S WHY WE CHANGED TO PREVENTION AND TECHNICAL. ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WE SAW THE MAIN AND WE PULLED IN ON OUR PARTNERS ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO TO REALLY. FACES HAT ON AND NOT JUST COMMAND THAT THE PREVIOUS. MISSION IS TO JUST WHEN YOU SEE IT YOU CITED PEOPLE WERE SHUTTING DOWN SO WE REALLY PULLED TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS WE TAKE THIS AS A VERY- HIGH PRIORITY WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S COMING AND- YOU KNOW THE MASTER PLAN OF AGING YOU KNOW WORKING. WITH US IT'S ALL MOVING TOWARDS- THAT POPULATION THAT YOU JUST SPOKE TO SO IF YOU GOT IMPRESSION THAT WERE JUST SITTING BACK AND MY- WHAT WERE NOT. AND CERTAINLY A I DON'T THINK THAT ARE IMPRESSION IS THAT SOCIAL SERVICES AND A LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES AND PROACTIVE MANNER BUT- I THINK I DO THINK THAT. IN ADDITION TO AND I REALIZE MY YOUR MAIN JOBS IS TO LICENSE AND BE SURE AS I AM ALSO THINKING ABOUT YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONES WHO ARE IN THE FIELD TO DOING THIS. WE ALSO NEED SOME HELP FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE ON THE GROUND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO. TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BEDS BECAUSE WHEN YOU TOLD ME AND I FEEL THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE CENTURY LEVEL GOES UP AND DOWN PERCENT FROM LAST. YEAR THE LOWER SOME BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A LINE THAT. SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO TO CHANGE THE TREND LINE SO DO WE HAVE MORE I APPRECIATE THERE'S YEAH WE HAVE SOME OTHER PROPOSAL SO WE'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THOSE- BUT YOU KNOW WE GOT FIGURE OUT WHAT. THE TRAJECTORY IS IN OUR LOSING US IF THAT'S ASIDE BEDS ARE GOING DOWN WELL WHAT IS IT ABOUT THAT NO SOME PEOPLE MAY SAY WE NEED MORE MONEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- MAYBE THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO AS WELL. AND THEN IF BUT THAT THE NET IS THAT WE'RE SOURCE. SAME THAT LOW WILL RUN NOT WORK AND SO WE NEED MORE. SUGGESTIONS AND FEEDBACK. INFORMATION REGIS WHICH IS WHY. ALONG THAT LINE. AND WHY AS TO HOW. WE CAN GET SOME HELP AND TO FIGURE OUT WHY TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO. TRY TO GET AN UP TICK. A SUSTAINED UPTICK IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS. AS WELL. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THINK YEAH.

AS AND IF YOU CAN PLEASE COME ON UP AND STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. I WANT TO GIVE UP WE WILL HOLD OFF ON QUESTIONS AND TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. WE HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR TOO MANY NUMBERS I'M JOE RODRIGUEZ I'M THE CALIFORNIA STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN. KAREN LARSEN DIRECTOR OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES REAL COUNTY GEORGE CANARIUM SIX BEDS. HEATHER HARRISON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION. MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWO AND I HAD THE OFFICE OF THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN WHICH IS ESTABLISHED IN THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT AND THEN THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT AS AN INDEPENDENT. PERSON CENTERED COMPLAINT RESOLUTION AN ADVOCACY PROGRAM FOR RESIDENTS OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. THE MISSION OF THE OFFICE IS TO IDENTIFY INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE COMPLAINTS. THAT ARE MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF RESIDENTS. THAT MADE PERSONALLY AFFECT THE HEALTH SAFETY WELFARE OR RIGHTS OF THE RESIDENCE. THE OFFICE ANALYZES COMMENTS ON AND MONITORS THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS REGULATIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND ACTIONS THAT PERTAIN TO THE HEALTH SAFETY WELFARE AND RIGHTS OF RESIDENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE ADEQUACY OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND SERVICES IN THE STATE. THE OFFICE RECOMMENDS ANY CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS REGULATIONS POLICIES AND ACTIONS AS THE OFFICE DETERMINES TO BE APPROPRIATE. IN CALIFORNIA LOCAL OMBUDSMAN ENTITIES RECEIVE REPORTS OF SUSPECTED ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT OCCUR IN FACILITIES. THE OFFICE HAS NO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING AND SPECS AND LICENSED FACILITIES AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. THEY SANCTION THEM FOR VIOLATIONS OF STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN CONTRAST OMBUDSMEN REPRESENTATIVES WORK TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF RESIDENTS AND IMPROVE THE LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM. IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS RECEIVED AN APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND 25% INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. THIS BUILDS UPON PREVIOUS INCREMENTAL INCREASES IN FUNDING. WITH THIS NEW FUNDING LOCAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS REPORT BEING ABLE TO HIRE THIRTY SIX NEW FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS. NINETEEN NEW PART TIME STAFF. NINE EXISTING STAFF THAT WENT FROM PART TIME TO FULL TIME. AND TWELVE EXISTING PART TIME STAFF WHO SAW AN INCREASE IN HOURS. THIS FUNDING AND THESE POSITIONS ALLOW THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM TO VISIT EVERY LONG TERM CARE FACILITY IN THE STATE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS NOT IN RESPONSE TO A COMPLAINT. THIS EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND SEVENTY THREE HUNDRED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. WE ALSO RECEIVED REPORTS OF ABUSE NEGLECT IN ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WE DON'T VISIT THEM ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IN FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN CALIFORNIA OMBUDSMEN REPRESENTATIVES INVESTIGATED ELEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE COMPLAINTS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED WERE RESIDENT CONFLICTS. ACCIDENTAL OR INJURIES OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN FALLS IMPROPER HANDLING. GROSS NEGLECT. PHYSICAL ABUSE AND RESIDENT TO RESIDENT PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE. LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AS A POSITIVE AND COLLEGIAL WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. LICENSING IS RESPONSIVE TO OMBUDSMEN CONCERNS. IF THE SITUATION IS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHEN MY LOCAL PROGRAMS. I CAN BRING TO LICENSING AND I KNOW THEY WILL RESPOND. LET ME SHORT SHARE A STORY WITH YOU SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED A FEW MONTHS AGO. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM OUR AFTER pSERVICE. IT WAS A SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THEY TAKEN A CALL FROM A DEPUTY. DOWN IN THE EAST BAY. WHO WAS RESPONDING TO A NINE ONE ONE CALL. THE NINE ONE ONE CALL WAS FROM A RESIDENT IN A FACILITY WHO FELT SHE WAS IN DANGER AND NEEDED HELP THE STAFF WERE AND RESPONSIVE. THE DEPUTY YOU WENT TO THE FACILITY. AND FOUND A KITCHEN TABLE FULL OF. MEDICATIONS MEDICATIONS THAT WERE DISORGANIZED WAS UNCLEAR WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RECEIVING THESE MEDICATIONS THEY WEREN'T SORTED THEY WEREN'T PROPERLY- BEING MAINTAINED. THERE WAS A RESIDENT WHO THE OFFICER FELT WAS IN DISTRESS AND NEEDED TO BE SEEN BY PROFESSIONALS. THE CARE GIVER WHO IS PRESENT. I DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH VERY WELL AND WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING WITH THE DEPUTY. THE DEPUTY FELT SOMEBODY NEEDED TO STEP IN. I CALLED LICENSING ONE OF THE PROGRAM MANAGERS FROM THE EAST BAY WHO HAS OVERSIGHT FOR FACILITIES IN THAT PART OF THE STATE. THIS IS ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK ON ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SAID I WILL GET A LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYST OUT THERE THIS AFTERNOON. IF I CAN'T FIND ONE I'LL GO OUT MYSELF. THE MANAGER ENDED UP GOING TO THE FACILITY. SHE STAYED UNTIL ABOUT TEN THIRTY THAT NIGHT AND KEPT IN COMMUNICATION WITH ME THE WHOLE EVENING SO I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON ONE RESIDENT WAS TRANSFERRED. STAFF DID HELP THE CARE GIVER ORGANIZE THE MEDICATIONS AND CLEAN THINGS UP. LICENSING KEEPS ME INFORMED OF THEIR ACTIONS AND COORDINATES WITH OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS. I KNOW THAT IF I MAKE A CALL. IT'S GOING TO BE RESPONDED TO. LICENSING INVITES US TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TRAINING FOR NEW LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYSTS SO THAT THEY WILL UNDERSTAND THE MISSION GOALS AND PROCESSES OF THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. LICENSING STAFF REGULARLY ATTEND OUR TRAINING FOR LOCAL OMBUDSMAN COORDINATORS SO THEY'RE AWARE OF WHAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING. AS THE ADVOCATE FOR RESIDENTS WE BRING CONCERNS AND ISSUES TO LICENSE THINGS THAT TENSION. ALL FACILITIES NEED OVERSIGHT AND ATTENTION FROM LICENSING. THE ON BUTTON IS THERE AS PROBLEM SOLVERS AND WORK WITH LICENSING TO PROMOTE QUALITY CARE NO MATTER THE SETTING. THANK YOU. FROM A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GEORGE COULD HEAR AND I'M HERE WITH SIX BEDS WHICH IS A STATE WIDE TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AN ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES SERVING SIX OR FEWER PERSONS- COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS BOARDING CARE HOMES ARE CURRENTLY BOARDING CARE HOMES REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 73% OF THE ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED RCF EASE AND APPROXIMATELY SO SIX OF THE MORE THAN FIVE AND HE ARE ABSENT. YEAH REPRESENTS SIGNATURE PHONE AND OF THE TENT ERIN ARE. I LIKE THIS I THINK IN THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS LEADERSHIP THEIR HARD WE SEEN POSITIVE CHANGES OVER THE LAST HANDFUL OF YEARS AND A NUMBER OF AREAS. INCLUDING MORE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS. STRONGER LICENSEE APPEAL RIGHTS FASTER PROCESSING OF NEW LICENSE APPLICATIONS NEW L. P. A. TRAINING. THE REEMERGENCE OF THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT UNIT. AN OVERALL SHIFT IN CULTURE THAT AS PRIORITIZE PREVENTION CONSULTATION AND COLLABORATION AS PART OF ITS TOOL KIT FOR ENGAGING PROVIDERS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS TO CREATE MORE CONSISTENT EXPERIENCES IN THE FIELD. AND A TWO THOUSAND SURVEY AT TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SURVEY TO PROVIDERS ONLY 47% OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WERE HAPPY WITH COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. AND OUR MOST RECENT SURVEY HERE IN 20002072% OF OUR RESPONDENTS SAID THAT THEY WERE HAPPY WITH COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING. A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. NOT WITHSTANDING SOME OF THESE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS ARE IN THE MARKET PLACE MANY PROVIDERS ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. FOR ONE PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND CARE GIVERS. WE EXPECT THERE TO BE A DECREASING SUPPLY A FAMILY CARE GIVERS AS A RACIAL FAMILY CARE GIVERS TO THOSE OVER EIGHTY IS EXPECTED TO SHRINK. FROM SEVEN A ONE IN 200-017-2421 IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTY AND JUST THREE TO ONE BY TWO THOUSAND FIFTY. THIS DYNAMIC SUGGEST A SIMULTANEOUS INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR RESIDENTIAL CARE IS THERE WILL BE LESS FAMILY CARE GIVERS TO RELY ON. AND ALSO A SHORTAGE OF PROFESSIONAL CARE GIVERS AS A GENERATION OF CARE GIVERS ARE EXITING THE WORK FORCE. A DOUBLE WHAMMY OF SORTS. IN A RECENT SURVEY OF PROVIDERS CARE GIVER SHORTAGE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE SECOND GREATEST CHALLENGE THEY FACE. IN THE SAME SURVEY. ARISING MINIMUM WAGE LIABILITY INSURANCE COSTS WORKERS COMP COSTS AND THE OVERALL COST OF REGULATION RIGHT IN A FIGHT AS BEING AMONG THE TOP FIVE GREATEST OPERATING CHALLENGES. IN PARTICULAR THE STATE INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY SINCE MINIMUM WAGE HAS A MAGNIFIED EFFECT ON OPERATING COSTS AS A DIRECTLY IMPACT OVER TIME A REAL TAXES AND WORKERS. BORN CARE PROVIDERS SIMPLY UNABLE TO ADEQUATELY SPREAD THESE RISING COSTS ACROSS SIX BEDS PER FACILITY. DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF THESE HOMES IT'S A HIGHLY FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY SEGMENT WITH MOST OWNERS OPERATING BETWEEN ONLY ONE IN THREE HOMES. THEY FRANKLY LACK ECONOMIES OF SCALE. HISTORICALLY BOARDING CARE PROVIDERS HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN HOUSING IN CARING FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS INCLUDING JEWEL SS. AS WELL AS OTHER LOW AND- MIDDLE INCOME SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION DEALING WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. HOWEVER WITH THE BACKDROP OF THESE OPERATING CHALLENGES AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER KAREN HOUSING AT THE SS I SS P. NON MEDICAL OUT OF HOME CARE RATE. WHICH IS CURRENTLY JUST ONE THOUSAND SIXTY NINE DOLLARS PER MONTH. THIS IS LESS THAN THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER DAY OR LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR FIFTY. PER HOUR. AREAS WITH HIGH PROPERTY COST TO SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES HAVE BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD WITH FACILITY CLOSURES. THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGE HOWEVER IS HARDLY ENDEMIC TO AREAS SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO AND LA OR FACILITIES A SERVE ONLY SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS. THEY REPRESENT THE LEADING EDGE OF THE PROBLEM AND ARE A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME. BASED ON OPERATING DATA COLLECTED AT A STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR AND IF THE SWIMMING FULL OCCUPANCY WE PROJECT AT THE FACILITY BREAK EVEN RATE PER RESIDENT IN CALIFORNIA. WILL BE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM. WITH JUST ONE VACANT UNIT THE BREAK EVEN INCREASES THE FORTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MONTHLY BREAK EVEN RATE THAT WILL BE AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT S. S. S. S. P. NON MEDICAL OUT OF HOME CARE RATE. ABSENT IN PREVENTION WE WILL. PASS THE FINE WITHIN THREE YEARS A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT OF THE STATE'S BOARDING CARE INDUSTRY TO BE ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED. IN FACT THE STAGGERING 44% OF PROVIDERS THAT RESPONDED TO OUR MOST RECENT SURVEY. INDICATED THAT THEY PLAN TO CLOSE THE FACILITY WITHIN ONE TO THREE YEARS. COMPARED TO ONLY 26% THAT INDICATED THEY PLAN TO OPEN A FACILITY WITHIN THE SAME TIME FRAME. WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE IS THE FOR OF THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. BOARDING CARE HOME STAND AT THE VERY INTERSECTION OF HOUSING AND CARE. AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL CONCEPT. THEY ALSO REPRESENT THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING HOUSING SUPPLY. BUT ONCE I SUPPLY IS LOST TO AN ALTERNATIVE USE IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO BRING BACK. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WORK CLOSELY WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES PROVIDER REPRESENTATIVES CONSUMER ADVOCATES. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS FACING THE MORNING HERE HOMES. THEY'RE OPERATING SERVICE THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF HEATHER HARRISON WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSISTED LIVING ASSOCIATION I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY I WAS ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROVIDERS CALIBER PRESENTS. THE RESIDENTS THEY SERVE AND SHARE OUR THOUGHTS ON THE SS OVERSIGHT IN GENERAL AND THE INSPECTION PROCESS IN PARTICULAR. CALORIE PRESENTS MORE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY LICENSED RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ASSISTED LIVING MEMORY CARE AND CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES. IN TOTAL OUR MEMBERS ARE LICENSED TO SERVE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS. OUR MEMBERS RANGE IN SIZE FROM SMALL SIX BUT COMMUNITIES TO LARGE PURPOSE BUILT COMMUNITIES THAT SERVE A HUNDRED OR RESIDENTS. AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES DEDICATED MARIE CARE COMMUNITIES. THE RANGE OF SETTING FROM SIZE AND FEATURES AN APPROACH TO CARE ALL HELPS PROVIDERS- OFFER CHOICE SO OLDER. HAVE OPTIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENTS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS WHAT UNITES OUR MEMBERS IS THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS MODEL OF- AND SHARING ITS ROLE FOR RESIDENTS TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. JUST AS THERE IS A RIGHT OF ASSISTANCE. PROVIDERS THE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE THERE'S ALSO RANGE OF RESIDENTS SERVED. RESIDENTS ARE MOST OFTEN IN OUR COMMUNITIES- WE FIND IN THEIR EIGHTIES SOME NEED LITTLE HANDS ON CARE THEY MIGHT STILL DRIVE IN ARE VERY ACTIVE IN THE GREAT COMMUNITY INDEPENDENTLY. SIGN ACT PRESS. ARE MORE FOR SOCIAL REASONS AND THE HEALTH CARE ON HAND SHOULD THEY NEED IT. MOST RESIDENTS THOUGH NEED HELP WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING LIKE DRESSING BATHING GROOMING MEDICATION ASSISTANCE. MANY HAVE DEMENTIA OR MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND SUMMER RECEIVING HOSPICE CARE AT THE END OF LIFE. AT RESIDENTS NEEDS IN. THEIR LEVEL OF INCREASES THE SERVICES THEY REQUIRE INCREASED AND THAT ALSO LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN COSTS AS WELL. ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF SUCCESS OF ASSISTED LIVING AND REALLY OF ANY LICENSE CARE PROGRAM IS THE INTEGRITY OF THE LICENSING AND OVERSIGHT SYSTEM ITSELF COMPLIANCE MATTERS AND APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT CAN HELP RESULT OF- ISSUES BEFORE THEY BECOME PROBLEMS. THIS AND CALIFORNIANS THE DECLINE IN INSPECTIONS AND THE REDUCTIONS NDSS STAFF HE FOUGHT WITH MANY OF IF YOU OF AND MANY OTHERS HERE IN THE ROOM TODAY TO RESTORE ON SECTIONS HERE BUT WE ARE VERY PLEASED. ANNUAL INSPECTIONS WERE FULLY ACHIEVED IN THE NINETEEN AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAND IS MAINTAINED. NO NEW. TOOL IN THE NEW SECTION PROCESSES STILL BEING PULLED OUT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH IT YET BUT IF IT MEETS EXPECTATIONS WHICH IS A MORE THOROUGH. INSPECTION THAT STILL HAPPENS ANNUALLY I THINK THAT SOMETHING WE WOULD ALL BE PLEASED WITH WE'VE HEARD THAT IT DOES TAKE LONGER- SETS HAVE. IS OKAY ISN'T GET MORE EXPERIENCE WITH IT AND MARK MILLER WITH THE TOOL ITSELF IN THE PROCESS THAT WOULD SPEED UP SOME. IT'S NOT ONLY. AND IT THE PLANE PROCESSING PROCESSING APPEALS REVIEWING- AND VETTING LICENSE APPLICATIONS SO THAT NEW PROVIDERS TO CAN COME INTO THIS FIELD BOB AND PROCESSING CRIMINAL THESE ARE ALL IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES REALLY REFOCUSED ON IN RECENT YEARS AND THEY'RE BEEN I'M OUR PERSPECTIVE. TICKET MEN'S IN REDUCING SOME OF THE BACKLOG IMPROVING THOSE LINES. OUR PEOPLE IN IS FOCUSED ON L. A. TRAINING- IT'S VITAL THAT THE INSPECTORS ARE FULLY PREPARED TO DO THEIR JOB- WITH THESE NEW TOOLS AND WITH THE CHANGING REGULAR AND. AND I HAVE- ONE OF CALLOUS TOP PRIORITIES WILL BE TO MAINTAIN THESE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS REALLY THE BEST WAY. FOR DSS TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY LICENSE IS TO VISIT THE COMMUNITIES THEY LICENSE- WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE EVERY YEAR WHAT THE COMMUNITIES TALKING TO RESIDENTS TALKING TO STAFF- BEING AWARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE- WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. MAKE AN IMPACT. IT CAN ON THE SIDE. TO AVOID ALARMS AND THEN TO TAKE QUICK AT. FIND ANY ISSUE THEY FACE FIELD. OF YOU KNOW I ALSO WILL AT YOUR HOUSE AS WE'RE SITTING HERE TODAY- IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK OF THE BAKER THE BROADER LONG TERM LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT WERE OPERATING WITHIN AND THAT THERE IS A PATIENT EARLIER ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. YEAH WE'RE REALLY IN. TO SEE THE FOCUS BEIJING A LONG TERM CARE ISSUES JUST IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR WITH THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE THE- THE- THE DEMOGRAPHICS BEING WHAT THEY ARE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY GOING TO COME TO. HAD AND WE ARE- ARE HOPEFUL THAT WITH THIS RENEWED ATTENTION WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO IDENTIFY. WAYS TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED HERE IN THIS ROOM TODAY BUT ALSO LOOK FOR CREATIVE WAYS TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS. OF OLDER ADULTS AND THE- THE CHANGING LARGER ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE ALL OPERATING WITHIN HI THIS IS RELEASED I HOPE. I THINK WE ALL HOPE WE CAN LOOK FOR AS WE AGE. WITH A CERTAIN COST. GOOD AFTERNOON I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT OUR LOCAL EXPERIENCE AS IT RELATES TO BOARDING CARE FACILITIES AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER COUNTY STATEWIDE MY NAME'S KAREN LARSON I'M THE DIRECTOR AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR YOLO COUNTY IN MY ALL I OVERSEE LIKE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR A GUARD CONSERVATIVE- WEALTH. IF YOU AT. AND EVERYONE IS ROLES I'M FACED WITH THE CHALLENGES OF POVERTY UNLIMITED HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS I YOLO COUNTY IS WHAT I LIKE TO CALL A GOLDILOCKS COUNTY WE'RE NOT TOO BIG WE'RE NOT TOO SMALL I WOULD JUST ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE WE HAVE JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND REST WERE GEOGRAPHICALLY ETHNICALLY AND SO. HONESTLY TO ABOUT 30% POPULATION LIVING POVERTY. WE SERVE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED CLIENTS IN OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THOSE ARE AN INPATIENT OUR HOSPITAL SETTINGS. BUT AREN'T THERE INDEPENDENT BOARDING CARE FACILITIES ARE CRITICAL PIECE OF THE HOUSING CONTINUUM FOR OUR CLIENTS COMING HOME FROM THE SETTINGS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE AT RISK FOR HOMELESSNESS WITHOUT THE SUPPORTS PROVIDED TO THAT. FACILITY CALIFORNIA. BOARDING CARE CRISIS NOW I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR FOR OUR CLIENTS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE HAVE A CRISIS NOW FOR THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING SSI AND STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT ARE IN NEED OF A BOARDING A LEVEL OF SUPPORT. AND THIS IS SERIOUSLY COMPROMISING OUR STATE'S ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS WITHOUT. FIVE WHEN CARE FACILITIES WE HAVE CLIENTS WAITING TOO LONG. IN EMERGENCY ROOMS FOR A TO GO OR STAY FAR TOO LONG IN MORE EXPENSIVE. SETTINGS WHILE OTHERS AWAIT THOSE SEPARATELY DID IMPAIR THAT. AND A LOT FACILITY. PERHAPS TURNING IS THAT DON'T ACT QUICKLY WHERE IS FOR ADDING YOUR- CHRONICALLY. MENTALLY ILL POPULATION. BROKE YOLO COUNTY OUR LOCAL BOARDING CARE NEED IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THAT OF OUR CAPACITY AS A RESULT MANY OF OUR CLIENTS END UP LIVING IN SURROUNDING COUNTIES. COUNTIES FACILITIES THIS IS AN OPTIMAL BECAUSE IT TAKES OUR CLIENTS AWAY FROM THEIR NATURAL SUPPORTS FROM THEIR COMMUNITY FROM THEIR CARE PROVIDERS AND IT ALSO TAKES AWAY FROM OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. THE PLACE I AM LOCAL. IN A DAY AND WHAT HAVE COUNTY CLERK. THEY'RE JUST GET A CALL WILL TRAVEL VISITING THAT'S BECAUSE OUT OF THE AIR AND TRANSFER THEIR MEDIC HOW AND OTHER BENEFITS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN COUNTY. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOLO COUNTY USE OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT INNOVATION DOLLARS TO HIRE AN EVALUATOR TO CONDUCT A STUDY AN OFFER SUGGESTIONS ON BEST PRACTICES ON THIS ISSUE WHAT WE LEARNED IS REFLECTIVE OF THE PICTURE I JUST DESCRIBED. ALONG WITH A NEW ONE SPECIFIC TO THE INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS. ARE OFF WITHOUT OF OUR LOCAL LOW. OPPORTUNITIES AS PROVIDERS GET IN MULTIPLE REFER AND ARE ABLE TO THOSE THAT ARE A LITTLE EASIER TO DEAL WITH. THIS MEANS THAT OUR CLIENTS WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS OFTEN STAY LOCKED FACILITIES LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD. OR ARE FORCED INTO. CAN HELP US. THREE THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT LEAD TO AN INCREASE NUMBERS OF INTO. WITH NEEDS LIVING FAR AWAY FROM THEIR COMMUNITY AND WHILE WAITING FOR THE BOARD OF CARE LEVEL OF SUPPORT. TO SUSTAIN OUR THIRTY SEVEN LOCAL BEDS WHICH IS ALL WE HAVE. AND WE ARE INVESTING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORTING ONGOING OPERATIONAL COSTS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE HOMES THE OPERATORS FOR THESE HOME SACRIFICE MUCH OF THEMSELVES FOR OUR CLIENTS MANY OF WHOM HAVE LIVED IN THOSE FACILITIES FROM YEARS. YET THEY'RE NOT PAID A LIVING WAGE THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO PAY RENT OR UTILITIES. ADDITIONALLY AND IN LINE WITH THE STATEWIDE GROWING NUMBERS OF AGING ADULTS AND OF SERVICES AND SPECIALIZED CARE. THESE BOARD AND CARE OPERATORS HAVE BECOME THE PRIMARY SUPPORT FOR SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WITH AGING SPECIFIC NEEDS. BUT WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RE. AND TRAINING TO MATCH THOSE NEEDS. ONE IN FOUR YOLO COUNTY RESIDENTS EXPERIENCE SEVERE HOUSING PROBLEMS WE EXPERIENCED A 40% INCREASE AND PEOPLE LIVING HOMELESS IN OUR LAST POINT IN TIME COUNT AND SOME OF OUR CITIES HAVE A HOUSING VACANCY RATE OF LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. YOLO COUNTY CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THESE HOMES AND THIS LEVEL OF CARE LOCALLY. IN FACT WE NEED MORE. STATEWIDE THE NUMBER A BOARDING CARE FACILITIES HAS DECLINED AT AN ALARMING RATE LARGELY DUE TO INADEQUATE FUNDING AND RISING HOUSING COSTS. LA HAS LOST OVER TWO HUNDRED BEDS JUST WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. NAPA REPORTED THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE WAS A 20% REDUCTION IN RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. AND SINCE TWO THOUSAND. FRANCISCO HAS LOST MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR LICENSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT SERVE PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY. THE REMAINING BOARDING CARE FACILITIES ARE FACING RAPIDLY INCREASING OPERATING COSTS AND ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD NEEDED REPAIRS TO MAINTAIN THEIR FACILITIES. AND OUR EXPERIENCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE ONCE A BOARDING CARE FACILITY CLOSE IS THAT SAUDI AN OPERATOR ARE GONE AND NOT REPLACE. THE LOSS OF ABOUT BORN CARE FACILITY PERMANENTLY REDUCES THE STATE PASSIVITY TO HOUSE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. OF PERSONS WHO ARE AGE DISABLED OR HAVE A MENTAL ILLNESS. ALL OF THIS THE EIGHT. BECOME HOMELESS ABOUT HALF OF OUR STATE HOMELESS POPULATION IS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY AND OF THOSE HALF ENTERED FOR HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY. CURRENTLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF. THESE ARE ABLE TO PAY HIGHER RATES DID A LEGISLATURE'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND SUPPORTED SIX STABLE HOUSING OPTIONS. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT RECTIFYING THAT SEVERITY AND SS I RATES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AMELIORATE MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WAS STANDING AND QUALITY. THESE DIFFERENTIAL RATES ARE ARE PAID IN THE SAME FACILITIES FOR THE SAME LEVEL OF CARE AND SERVICE CREATING AN ISSUE OF PARITY IN TERMS OF POLICY. REGARDLESS OF THE SOLUTION WE CAN TO THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT OUR CURRENT MODEL FOR BOARDING CARES IS NEITHER SUSTAINABLE NOR SAFE IN MANY CASES. WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND DEVELOP A NEW MODEL FOR THE FACILITIES WILL HELP THEM THRIVE AND GROW AND THAT WILL DO THE SAME FOR THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT THIS TIME- WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND ASK. AND IF YOU CAN'T SPELL A BIT MORE ON AT THE OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENTS AND THE DOMINO EFFECT IS IT HAVING ON- ON ON THE RECEIVING I'M A COUNTIES BUT ALSO ARE YOU AWARE OF OTHER COUNTIES THAT MAY BE. MAKING OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENT I THINK IT'S HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M IN. JUST OVER THE RIVER SO A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS. SACRAMENTO AM I WOULD SAY WE HAVE LIKE I SAID THIRTY SEVEN BEDS LOCALLY WE HAVE CLOSE TO SIXTY CLIENTS PASTE PLACE OUT OF COUNTY AND OTHER SETTINGS. AND THAT'S JUST LITTLE YOLO I THINK WE'RE A MICROCOSM OF WHAT'S HAPPENING STATEWIDE FOR SURE. CAN AT THIS TIME I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IN A PATH THANK YOU AND- PROUD TO REPRESENT YOLO COUNTY MY DISTRICT. SO WE WHAT SO WHAT DO YOU SEE S. SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS TO THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE THE CLIENT CARE LIKE WE JUST HAD A CONVERSATION WITH FARM SOCIAL SERVICES OUT THERE FAST THE AND SO FORTH FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT DO YOU SEE IS- THINGS THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER DOING TO CHANGE JUST THREE ON- THE NUMBER BORN. AIRBEDS WE HAVE. I THINK IF WE GET AWAY TO BRING THAT IRATE FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN LINE WITH THE SAME AS THOSE STRUGGLING WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THAT WOULD AMELIORATE THE PROP IT WOULD DOUBLE THE REVENUE THE BORN CARE PROVIDERS COULD RECEIVE FOR THOSE CLIENTS. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE ONE ONE MORE- JUST WANTED TO. ALSO ASK HOW MANY OF YOUR MEMBERS FOR THIS FOR GEORGE- HOW MANY REMEMBERS RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY THAT THE STATE IN A DECEPTIVE ESTA CYRUS- RECIPIENTS WHAT EXCLUSIVELY OR A MIX- DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS FOR THEY HAVE. MOST RECENT SURVEY WE DID WHICH- AFTER ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED BEDS OF CAPACITY WHICH IS THAT THE SURVEY IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS- 11% RESPONDED THAT THEY EXCLUSIVELY CARED FOR SS I SS BE AND THOSE ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES THAT RESPOND TO THAT. ARE AND 30% OF RISK THAT AND THAT THEY USED TO ACCEPT SS I SS PEOPLE NO LONGER DO. SO YOU KNOW AS ON ONGOING BASES WERE GOING TO WORK TO TRY TO COLLECT MORE DATA. ON ON SOME OF THAT. PARTICULAR ALSO ON THE KIND OF THE MIXED PPULATIONS OF THEIR FACILITIES EXCLUSIVELY EXCEPT SS I SS P. THERE'S ALSO FACILITIES THAT HAVE A MIX OF. MAYBE PRIVATE PAY AND SOME SS I SS. THOSE SS I SS BEES ARE NOT ALWAYS TIED IN WITH THE COUNTY SYSTEM- SO WE'RE- GONNA TRY TO BE MORE AND MORE. YOUNG MORE DATA GATHERING ON THAT. OR WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR PANEL FOR TWENTY NECESSARY AFTERNOON AND FRAZIER. ON STATEMENTS OUT AT THIS. TIME I'D LIKE TO CALL UP. THE NEXT PANEL GOING FORWARD.

CONTACT GATHER PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR AND I LEADERS ARE CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS THANK. JOHN SHEERAN FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT ABOUT HEALTH. IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE ND AYE AYE THANK YOU WE ARE NOT A GOLDILOCKS COUNTY AND YOU KNOW I GOT TO SAY THIS IS THIS. THIS EFFORT- IS ONE THAT'S REALLY- I THINK GALVANIZING A LOT OF MOMENTUM AND I'M SO THANKFUL I'M THANKFUL- TO THE STATE AMOUNTS OF THANKFUL TO MY MEMBERS SUPERVISORS WHICH REALLY. GOT BEHIND THIS. AND YOU KNOW FOR ME- IN MY ROLE THIS IS ABOUT- FOLKS WITH SEVERE PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS. HOMELESSNESS AND INCARCERATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK. AND I WILL I AM A PSYCHIATRIST SO I COME AT YOU WITH TO REAL QUICK SCENARIOS I DO- I DO ST PSYCHIATRY ST MEDICINE IN SKID ROW- AND I SPEND TIME WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE. WHO ARE DEVASTATED AND THEY'RE LIVING IN HORRENDOUS CONDITIONS. BUT THERE PEOPLE THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE WHO IN THE AREA IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT FOR EXAMPLE BEING IN A BOARDING CARE. WILL THRIVE IN THEIR OWN WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT- I TAKE WITH ME THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW THESE WE HAVE LOCKED FACILITIES PEOPLE CALL THEM I AM THESE. AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WERE READY TO GO BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE PROPER SUPPORTS AND LIVING ENVIRONMENTS. AND IT'S VERY COSTLY IS ALSO IN MY OPINION. NOT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY REALLY BOTHERS ME. THE THING ABOUT BURNING CARE FOR ME IS THAT IN A BOARDING CARE. IS TYPE OF SHARED OR COLLABORATIVE HOUSING. AND IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A RESOURCE. THAT IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT- THAT THAT I THINK IS NOT. RECOGNIZED IN THE WAY THAT IT COULD BE. AS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE MUST LEVERAGE. IN OTHER WORDS WE SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY DEVELOPING. NEW INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH TAKES A LOT OF TIME AT THE SAME TIME THAT THIS KIND OF COLLAPSE OF A SYSTEM IS HAVE IT IS OCCURRING. THE OTHER THING ABOUT ABOUT BOARDING. BUT I'M A I'M A SICK A MENTAL HEALTH GUY AND BOARDING CARE MEANS A CERTAIN THING TO ME BUT IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING ABOUT THE REST OF THE ARE SEE IF YOU CAN ARE FOR OLD. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS LOTS OF TYPES SO HE'S OUT TO DIFFERENT TO POPULATION AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE NEED TO KATE NICE THAT WE NEED AS IT IS NOT. ONE THING- FOR MY PEOPLE. IT'S OFTEN THE PURPOSE. THE PLACE AND THE PEOPLE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AS MUCH AS IT IS THE CARE. AND WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IT'S BURNING CARE IS A VERY RARE ENTITY. I FOLLOW BECAUSE THE BUSINESS MODEL- OKAY IN IS ACTUALLY ARE BREAKING AND IT'S WHY I THINK I YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE'RE WE'RE ALL HERE FOR DIFFERENT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BUT- OPTED TO SEE THIS HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AN ALARMING RATE I MEAN IT. IS IT'S MARCH. EVEN FEBRUARY. YOU KNOW I'M SAYING IT'S THIS IS A PROCESS THAT IS EXHILARATING IT IT DOESN'T STOP AND WE'RE USING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BEDS SINCE I TOOK OVER THIS ROLE THREE YEARS AGO. AND WITH THE FIX TO THE BUSINESS MODEL ISN'T CLEAR THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING- POSSIBILITIES NOTHING. SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE BEEN REYES INCLUDING THE SS I RATE. BUT THE THING ABOUT THE LOSS OF A BOARDING CARE BAD IS IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU'RE LOSING A UNIT. YOU LOSING US. AND WE LIVE IN WE HAVE IT WITH THE NIMBY. NIGHTMARE FOR THOSE OF US ARE TRYING TO SAY PROJECTS. AND YOU KNOW LOSING TEN BEDS AND A SITE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE INCLUSION. AND REINTEGRATION IS REALLY REALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND I DON'T THAT'S OF THE VALUE OF A SITE CANNOT BE LOST. AS WE- PUSH THIS EFFORT SO FOR ME IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SAVING AND RESTORING THE BOARDING CARE NETWORK IT'S ABOUT GROWING IT. AND YES THE RATE IS ONE THING THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC RIGHT HOUSING THAT. PORTING CARES HAVE GOTTEN A BAD NAME. IN TERMS OF THE KEY ISSUES WELL THE CONDITIONS ARE NOT GREAT BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FUN. SO THERE EASIER BUT ALL THERE'S BEEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BECAUSE THERE HAVEN'T HAD THE RATES HAVEN'T HAD. CAPITAL TO INVEST. THE THING THAT UP HEY. AT WHAT UP IT IS THE. FORTY ME AS I WAS IS A CERTAIN TYPE. HOW PERMANENT OUT SHARED COLLAB. HOUSE AND- AS CAN WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET SO. FOR BOARDING CARE YOU KNOW I THINK SEX EIGHT VOUCHER A LOT I THINK OF NO PLACE LIKE HOME CAN WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE BRING IN FUNDING THAT IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THERE'S A LICENSING COMPONENT AND I THINK THAT IF WE REFER AROUND THE FACT THAT FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS IT IS HAPPENING WE TO BE FIGURED OUT OF BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BRING IN HOUSING SUBSIDY THANKS VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I WANTED PARTICULAR THANK THE STAFF OF THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER HI MY NAME'S PAT MCGINNIS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM THAT WERE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS WE HAVE PROVIDED ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT FOR LONG TERM CARE CONSUMERS INCLUDING NURSING HOMES RESIDENTIAL CARE OF REASON CONTINUING CARE FACILITIES. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED BEDS AND SO FOR AGING DISABLED ADULTS AND NOT JUST TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BUT TO ENSURE THAT THE SAFETY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND TO PREVENT HARM TO THEM HOWEVER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BURDEN CARE FACILITIES WE NEED TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR BANDS. NEED FOR QUALITY CARE AS WELL- EVERY DAY WE BEGAN TWO HUNDRED AND FORM IN HOT ARE ON OUR HOTMAIL THANKS I'D EVERY MONTH FROM PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT CARE BUT ALSO LOOKING FOR BANDS AND ALSO AN AWFUL. PULLING THEIR RESIDENTIAL THEY PLACE IN SOME PLACE BUT THERE IS RUN OUT IF YOU LIVE LAW ENOUGH. AND YOU'RE NOT RICH YOU MONEY GONNA RUN WHEN YOU IN A NURSE HOME OR IN A RED. CARE AND THE- TO THAT ARE VERY VERY FEW. LICENSE CARE HOMES ALSO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA I DO THINK THAT THE IDEA OF BOARD WHICH IN ONE SENSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN THE AIR WHICH IS A NOT SENSE THAT THEY BOARDED THERE ARE FACILITIES THAT. CORD I. PRICES CITIES IN THE PROVIDE BOARD CARE WE MORE NURSING HOMES IN ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS DUMPING PEOPLE INTO THESE CHEAP ALTERNATIVES- WHY. BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAPER BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COST THEM AS MUCH SO WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK IF WE ARE GOING TO. HUSBAND FUNDS TO HAS POOR ILL ON HOUSE TO MENTALLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUALS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT HOUSE. IN IF THEY NEED OTHER CARE IN UNLICENSED FACILITIES- I THINK SOME OF THE ANSWERS ARE PRETTY OBVIOUS WE NEED MORE FUNDING WE NEED TO INCREASE THE SS I SS P. RATES- THERE FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS TO ALLOW. THOSE FACILITIES AND ACTUALLY ACCEPT SS I SS P. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BE FINDING A SUSTAINABLE AND ALSO TO PREVENT EVEN MORE HOMELESS. NEED TO SPEAK ON THE IS LIVING FOR PROGRAM WE'VE TALKED. FOR YEAR. BUT WHEN CALL US TONIGHT I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHAT COUNTY ARE YOU IN YOU'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT HONEY OR IF. THE PAY PROGRAM NOT IN THE DESERT. IS A LUDICROUS THAT WE'VE DEAL A LOT TERM CARE IS AND- ON YOUR WE BY DOING THIS FOR ON TIME. I'M GONNA WASHINGTON HAVE ABOUT FOR YOU. HAVE HAD A AND- LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE UNDER THE MEDICAID WAIVER SO THAT THEY CAN FUND THESE KINDS PROGRAM. PEOPLE GET DEEP THINK. I WE THINK THAT THESE. I DON'T ANSWER. THAT. CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY ACT- IN THIS WAS AMENDED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE. WHERE THEY RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR A TIERED LEVEL OF CARE THAT WOULD REPRESENT THE RANGE OF CARE NEEDS BY FOR THE ELDERLY RESIDENTS INCLUDING BASIC CARE AND SUPERVISION WHICH IS ONE LEVEL- NON MEDICAL PERSONNEL. PERSONAL CARE WHICH IS ANOTHER LEVEL AND HEALTH ASSISTANCE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY REGULATIONS AND STATUTES AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT HAS NEVER MADE SENSE EVEN BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER FUNDED IT- I WOULD SAY THAT TO BE SYSTEM IT WOULD TO BE SUSTAINABLE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE MENTAL. MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL SERVICES MEDICAL SERVICES SOCIAL SUPPORT AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT. SO IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE FUND THIS LEVELS OF CARE AND THAT WE IMPLEMENT THE TIERED LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM. AND FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. FOR CC WE TALK ABOUT ALL THESE. THE CARE LICENSING TO ACTUALLY OVERSEE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO OVERSEE IN THAT THEY'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO OVERSEE- THEY'VE REGULATE OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND DIFFERENT FACILITIES STATE RIDE ARE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS STATEWIDE- YOU KNOW WHEN I STARTED MY ORGANIZATION THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. WE USED TO DO THEY USED TO DO EVALUATIONS EVERY TWICE A YEAR AND THEN IT WENT TO- ONCE A YEAR AND THEN IT WENT TO EVERY FIVE YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN THERE I HAVE WATCHED THEIR BUT- BEING CUT. CUT CUT CUT AND THE KINDS OF SERVICES OVERSIGHT THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALSO BEING CUT. SO TO PRETEND THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY FULLY FUNDED THEM IS A JOKE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T- WITH IT ANYONE SPECS SHINS AN INCREASE IN LICENSE THE APPLICATIONS. STOP ALLIES DOWN CATION POLICY. THE DEPARTMENT HAS STRUGGLED TO MEET ITS GOALS THAT THERE'S GOING TO INSURE QUALITY OF CARE. WHY OF THE REASONS THE THANK. THE PART THAT CLEARLY IS THE A PAY FOR THE L. A.'S DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY. IN IT'S ALWAYS MY WE KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE IT'S WHERE YOU THAT MONEY IT'S CERTAINLY A SWITCH FOR CANDOR TO BE PRAISING AND ENFORCEMENT AGENCY RATHER THAN COMPLAINING- BUT I THINK CCL HAS PROVIDED A COMMITMENT AND SHOWN THEIR COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. AND DESERVES TO HAVE THE FUNDING NEEDED TO DO THE JOB THAT THEY ARE SO CLEARLY EAGLE TO EAT YOUR TO DO. AS A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY WE CAN'T JUST THROW MONEY AT BOARDING CARE FACILITIES AND THINK THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. IF WE DON'T PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO DO THE TRAINING THE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO UNDERSTAND THE LAWS TO ADEQUATELY VET LICENSE THE APPLICATIONS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FOLKS ARE FIT TO OPERATE A FACILITY IN THE FIRST PLACE. STOP UNLICENSED OPERATORS TO ABOUT A VALUE. TAKE THE TIME THIS IS NEW THE VALUE. FOR A NEW. TIME TO BE A TO DO IT BOB. I'M ALL DOING IS PER FUN TO BE PEOPLE IF WE DON'T FULLY FUND THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY. L. IT WOULD LEAD. FOR THE- WERE TRYING TO PROTECT. AN AND ALSO THIS SIGHTEDNESS WILL SHIP COME BACK TO HER US. THANK YOU. I'M SORRY NO THAT'S OKAY- I JUST WILL JUST ADD THAT WERE JUST READY TO INFORM AND BE INFORMED BY THE MASTER PLAN FOR EIGHTEEN AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS TO GIVE OUR- OUR INSIDE. SENATE JACKSON YES I DID THE CHECK A QUESTION A JUST THROW OUT- I DIDN'T HEAR THIS AN APOLOGETIC GOT A LITTLE LATE. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS AS WE DID LIKE WITH OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE I'M NOT SURE WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND SO AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE AND I WAS READING AN ARTICLE BUT I THINK DAVID BROOKS CAME OUT WITH THE SAID YOU KNOW THE NUCLEAR FAMILY HAS BEEN AT THE FASTER FOR. AND I IT. ABOUT I CHAU AND MY MOTHER CHILDHOOD AND CAN OF THE FAMILY GRANDMA AND THE AT THE AUNTS AND UNCLES HALL LIVE RELATIVELY CLOSE BY AND YOU KNOW GOD HELP US ON THANKSGIVING EVERYBODY A MERCHANT GRANDMA'S HOUSE IT WAS CHAOS BUT RIGHT NOW- AS WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR AGING POPULATION IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE HOUSING I THINK OF GRANNY FLAT I THINK OF EIGHTY USE I THINK OF OUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO. THE FIFTH AT HE WILL PART MAYBE SEE PUT THE FAMILY BACK TOGETHER AGAIN- SO THERE SO THE FAMILIES CAN PROVIDE CARE GRANDMA CAN PROVIDE SOME CHILD CARE ON OCCASION FOR THE LITTLE ONES AND THEN WHEN GRANDMA NEEDS CARE THAT THE FAMILIES THERE TO HELP GRANDMA OR GRANDPA I MEAN. IT'S TIME. THE ONLY UNIT. IS I THINK PART OF THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT THAT YOU MIGHT SHARE HOW CAN WE ENCOURAGE IS I MENTION YOU KNOW HAVING HOUSING BEING CLOSER TOGETHER WHEN I USED TO WALK PRECINCTS- I'D COME UPON HOMES WHERE THERE'S THE GARAGE IN THE HOUSE AND LO AND BEHOLD THE KIDS IN THEIR FAMILY OR IN THE HOUSE AND GRANDMA AND GRANDPA MOVED INTO THE GARAGE LIVE THERE THIRTY FORTY YEARS IN THE- THAT IN. A UNIT OF. HAPPENED A YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE DO HAVE FAMILIES AND DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO LIVE IN ISOLATION. ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO I AND SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IS A WAY TO. SORT OF TRY TO REPAIR. IN THAT KIND OF SOCIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA THAT THAT USED TO HELP FAMILIES DURING THOSE KIND OF INTER GENERATIONAL CHALLENGES SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY BUILDING MORE FOR. YOU KNOW OR BUILDING OUR WAY OUT OF THIS WITH WITH SENIOR HOMES ALTHOUGH THOSE ARE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO THAT TOO BUT I JUST THROW THIS OUT. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON IT BECAUSE MY MOM JUST DIED LAST APRIL IT NINETY SEVEN YEARS OLD AND WE PROVIDING CARE FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME I WAS BACK EAST. PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR TIMES A YEAR BUT I WAS LUCKY. AJ WE'RE IRISH SHEET WE HAVE SEVEN KIDS IN THE FAMILY SO WE COULD TAKE TURNS. HOWEVER AND I AGREE WEEK I GREW UP THE SAME WAY EVERYBODY HAD AN AUNT AND UNCLE AND ANY NINETY YEAR NOW ON OUR GRANDMOTHER SOMEBODY LIVING WITH THEM WE TOOK CARE OF MY AUNT. WHAT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE TODAY ARE ON THE PHONE WE GET HUNDREDS OF PHONE CALLS EVERY MONTH WHAT I HEAR IS THE GAS FOR A OF KIDS THEY'RE NOT HERE. THEY GO TO WASHINGTON DC TO GET A JOB WE GET CALLS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FROM PEOPLE MY MOM'S IN CAL. AND SHE'S SECOND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BRIDGE THAT PARTICULAR GAP BUT DO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY CAN A- JET AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THEIR KIDS DON'T GET. SO THAT DATA WANT TO DEAL WITH I WOULD SUSPECT MORE THAN HALF DON'T BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. YEAH AT. WELL WE'RE NOT. HAVING INNER CHANNEL. FAMILIES IS NOT THE PAM. I'M SURE THINKING IT MIGHT BE IT IT'S ONE OF THOSE. THAT PERHAPS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MORE WHEN PEOPLE DO CHOOSE TO LIVE IN THE SAME WORSE OR CLOSE. THEIR SHARED HOUSING- PROJECTS IT WHERE YOU ARE YOU MATCH. COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH AN ELDERLY PERSON WHILE THEY ARE LIVING THERE. I THINK HONESTLY THAT IT STOPS WHEN THAT PERSON'S NEEDS BECOME TOO HOT- AND THAT'S WHEN IT STOPS. AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE END UP GOING INTO A BOARDING CARE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES I AGREE PEOPLE. WE NEED TO DO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS OVER THE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA- I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS. IF I COULD JUST A BRIEFLY WE'RE WE'RE WORKING NOT ME ON- ON A PROGRAM THAT WILL- YOU KNOW REUNITE FAMILIES- PARTICULARLY WITH THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND HAVE BEEN IN ON OFF THE STREETS AND AN IN AND OUT OF JAIL- ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT I THINK IS IT. IS ILLNESS FRACTURES FAMILIES AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO TREATMENT ON THE OTHER THING I'M JUST YOU KNOW JUST SAY IT THE YOU KNOW- HIPPA. AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE ARE CHALLENGED BY WHICH ARE FEDERAL DON'T HELP BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T ALLOW FAMILIES TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT CORE ISSUES AND THAT'S A BIG BIG PROBLEM. YEAH I WILL JUST ADD THAT IN ALL OF OUR HOUSING CONVERSATIONS YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THE FIRST UP THE FEEDBACK IS MORE HOUSING BUT THE SECOND IS MORE INNOVATION AND JUST THREE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD AROUND THE STATE I'M SAN DIEGO A COUNTY HAS PRE APPROVED FIVE EIGHTY YOU MODELS SO IF YOU USE ONE OF THOSE FIVE EIGHTY USE IT WILL BE APPROVED YOUR SAME THE PLANNING COSTS YOU SAVE SOME TIME THERE NEVADA COUNTY AT THE ROUND TABLE UP THERE THEY SAID WE HAVE PLENTY OF SQUARE FOOTAGE IS JUST WITH THE WRONG PEOPLE IN THE WRONG. CAN I SUBDIVIDE MY HOUSE CAN I CAN I DO THAT PUT A KITCHEN IN THE BACK AND HOW DO WE HELP LOCAL ZONING AND LOCAL REGULATION MOVED TO THAT HUGE HOUSE BECOMING A TRIPLEX OR A MULTI PLEX- AND THEN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD A NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT HAS GONE UP THAT IS HALF SENIORS AND HALF OF FOSTER YOUTH AGING OUT THE SYSTEM AND SO AGAIN THAT MIX GENERATIONAL CROSS- NOT JUST SENIOR CENTER SENIOR HOUSING BUT CROSS GENERATIONAL SO I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR EXAMPLES OF THAT AND HOW WE CAN HELP SCALE AND SPEED. THIS IS SAM DISCO THEY MADE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD IN LOS UNITS AND ALSO I WAS AT A HEARING FOR- SOMEBODY'S TAXES THIS ELDERLY COUPLE THEY BUILT OF DID YOU KNOW AS THE BATHROOM IN THEIR HOUSE AND TAXES WERE INCREASED TO THOUGHT DOLLARS A YEAR. WHICH IS. THAT'S JAMES. WE MAY. I THE AND YOUR TAX GO UP YOU BUILD IN LOS. IN PARTICULAR PLACE LIKE. THIS TAX ARE PRETTY ALREADY SO. WELL I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT WE ARE THIS TO THE DESERT OF A ENERGY. RELATIONSHIPS AND THE THAT THEY CAN BE A WIN WIN WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A CHALLENGE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH COGNITIVE ISSUES THAT CAN BE A CHALLENGE. BUT PUTTING PEOPLE IN THESE OTHER FACILITIES ISN'T IT HI IT JUST ISN'T THE PANACEA THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHEN WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT- I JUST WONDER IF WE COULD START THINKING ABOUT. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FAMILIAR OF FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS A LITTLE BIT MORE RECOGNIZING THEIR VALUE I MEAN THEY'VE BEEN A THEY'VE BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS HUMANKIND IN AND AS THEY GET MORE AND MORE ATTENUATED THERE IS THAT GREATER ISOLATION THAT GREATER LOSS AND ALL ALL THOSE THINGS SAID. WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT IT AND HOPE THAT- WE SEE SOME DISCUSSION AGAIN IT'S NOT THE ANSWER BUT IT COULD BE PART OF THE- JACK. I HAVE QUESTION FOR. I WONDERED IF THERE'S I KNOW THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN TCL BUT CAN YOU YOU JUST. GIVE ME MAYBE LIKE THE TOP PRIORITIES A BIT DID YOU TO. ARE LOOKING AT. WELL RIGHT NOW OUR PRIORITY IS TO- IMPLEMENTED TOOL THE INSPECTION TOOL FOR FOUR PLANNING ON ROLLING THAT OUT TO ALL OF OUR ALL THREE FACILITY TYPES ARE PROGRAM TYPES CHILD CARE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL ADULTS SENIOR SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES- REVISE IN OUR REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING ON THE DEMENTIA RAGS- AND THE COME. THAT THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO OUR LICENSEES TO SO IT'S LIKE WE'RE WORKING ON SEVERAL HIGH PRIORITIES AND BECAUSE ITIT REALLY TAKES IT'S SO COMPLEX THAT IT TAKES. A VILLAGE TO GET THIS COMPLETED HAND. WE TAKE THE RESPONSES THAT WE GET FROM OUR L. PAYS OUT IN THE FIELD TO SEE WHAT WHAT THE NEED IS AS WELL AS FROM LIKE THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM THAT'S OUT IN THE- IN THE FACILITIES. MORE FREQUENTLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH I WANT TO THANK OUR OUR FINAL PANEL AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT PARTICIPATED IN TODAY'S HEARING I ALSO WANTED A THINKER HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE TEAM OF FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON TRYING TO GET TOGETHER THIS THIS AT THIS HEARING TODAY- I THINK FIFTY WE HAVE A LOT OF A THERE'S A LOT OF YOU KNOW WORK BEING DONE BY CC ALLEN AND- WE COMMEND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE HARD WORK DONE IN RECENT YEARS TO REBUILD THE DIVISION. AFTER DUSTED BUDGET CUTS OF THE COMBINATION OF SEARCHING POPULATION OF ELDERLY CALIFORNIANS IN A WIDENING GAP BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS MEANS HE FEEL OVERSIGHT IN THE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES FACILITIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE ARE WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE OUR SENIORS ARE PEOPLE SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE SAFE AND A PROPERLY CARE FOR WHILE RESIDING IN LICENSED FACILITIES. I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU IN THIS CAPACITY OF THIS CONCLUDES TODAY'S HEARING OF THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE WE ARE ADJOURNED. THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENTS. SO AT THIS WELL THAT'S OKAY AT THIS POINT GO HEAD TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT OKAY. FOOD NO. IT'S MONDAY IT'S OUR FIRST HEARING RIGHT. YOU'RE JUST GETTING STARTED- I'M NOT APRIL FIRST I PROMISE. I'M THERESA COMSTOCK I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WE SUPPORT THE WORK OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY NINE A MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND WE'RE PASSING OUT OUR ISSUE BRIEF THIS IS- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND HOPING TO CALL ATTENTION TO SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS THEM. A MEETING TODAY- THIS IS A ISSUE BRIEF THAT SUMMARIZES WHAT WHAT WE SEE IS AS THE KEY CHALLENGES- WHAT KIND OF COSTS ARE WE INCURRING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BOARDING CARES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS- WE- HAVE DATA THAT I'M POINTS TO HUNDREDS OF BEDS LOST. AND FOUND ALSO IF YOU PULL THIS UP ONLINE YOU'LL SEE THAT THE SCHEDULE THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR FUNDING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND- AND THEY'RE ABLE TO DROP BY AS MUCH AS NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER MONTH RIGHT NOW DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. ALTHOUGH PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ONLY DRAWING THAT ONE THOUSAND SIXTY NINE DOLLARS PER MONTH- SO WE'RE- PLEASE THAT YOU'RE CALLING A TEN TO THIS ISSUE AND WE SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND HOPING TO SEE FUNDING AROUND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO BOLSTER THE BOARDING CARRIES YOU BECAUSE IT IS AN IMMEDIATE NEED. THANKS. AFTERNOON LEASE A COMMON WITH THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION AB I I'D CONTINUE THE LOVE FAST FOR CC OUT THE LOCAL PROGRAMS TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THE QUARTERLY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WITH THEIR LOCAL ON MANAGING REGIONAL. OF THAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION THAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN THE LOCAL OMBUDSMAN MCC L. IS REALLY BENEFICIAL IT IT HELPS THE OMBUDSMAN TO BE DIRECTED. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A HOT SPOT HERE IT HELPS NGUYEN LICENSING HEARS FROM THE OMBUDSMAN THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AB I WANT TO POINT OUT- ONE OF THE THINGS SENATOR PAN TALKED ABOUT WAS THE- IT SEEMS TO BE A STABLE BAD. IN THE ASSISTED LIVING. THERE WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A TEN THOUSAND- BED COUNT INCREASE IN THE LAST. FEW YEARS IN AND THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS DOCUMENTATION FROM C. C. L. WHAT'S CHANGED IS THE NUMBER OF LICENSES SO WE'VE HAD A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LICENSES AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BEDS. THAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNIZE YOUR CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT THE GROWING NUMBER OF SENIORS THAT NEED THE CARE. BUT WHAT OUR MEMBERS ARE SAYING IS PEOPLE ARE ENTERING INTO ASSISTED LIVING LATER WHEN THEY'RE SICKER. WHEN THEY HAVE HIGHER NEEDS AND SO THEY'RE STAYING AT HOME LONGER THEY'RE TRYING TO PATCH THINGS- WITH LOCAL SERVICES FOR LONGER BEFORE THEY GO INTO ASSISTED LIVING. THAT PUTS GREATER PRESSURE ON THE ASSISTED LIVING STAFF THEN ALSO PUTS A MORE PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO RUN OUT OF FUNDS. IF YOU'RE IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF FUNDS YOU PROBABLY ARE NOT GOING TO BECOME ELIGIBLE THE BULK OF THEM ARE NOT GONNA BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SS I SS BE RATE. BECAUSE THEIR MONTHLY INCOME IS OVER THAT POVERTY LIMIT. SO THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT I REALLY WORRY ABOUT THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE CURRENTLY FOR SS I SS P. THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER PROGRAM WAS REFERENCE THAN THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE THE EASIEST WAY. TO ADDRESS THAT- INCOME PERSON AS LONG AS YOU ADDED A SHIPPER OF COST. NO THE PERSON CAN APPLY FOR THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER IF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME IS TOO HIGH. I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN DO. WELL AS AS THE INNER CENTER JACKSON SAID WE CAN'T BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS. BUT THESE HEARINGS ARE A GOOD START AS A PERSON WHO LIVES WITH OUR- MOTHER LIVES WITH THEM ALL FOR INTERGENERATIONAL HOUSING. AND MY YOUNGEST AND MY SON WAS ABLE TO BUY HIS FIRST HOME BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH A GRANDPARENT FOR A YEAR PROVIDING CARE AND SAVED RENT. THERE ARE OPTIONS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU- TEAR HER TITLE FOR HOLDING THIS I'M JANE ADCOCK WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL. BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ACTUALLY STAFF FROM COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING REACHED OUT TO US BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF THE OWNER OPERATORS WERE STRUGGLING SERVING FOLKS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. THAT CAUSED US TO EMBARK ON THIS PROJECT WE ISSUED A REPORT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WILL SEND IT TO YOUR STAFF. IT DOES TALK ABOUT FOR THE THIRTY I THINK IS ABOUT THIRTY THREE COUNTIES IT RESPONDED- IT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT THEY AREN'T AVAILABLE AND HOW MANY THEY'RE PAYING FOR OUT OF COUNTY. WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THIS ISSUE KIND OF A HIERARCHY OF NEEDS IN THE VERY FIRST ONE IT IT'S ALL FINANCIAL WE NEED TO STOP THE LOSS OF THE BED SAYS DR SHARON MENTION YOU AND YOU LOSE A FACILITY YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET IT BACK- SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT TO. BRING THAT AND DOLLAR AMOUNT EACH MONTH CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL COST WHEN PEOPLE ARE ON AS A SIDE THAT YOU'VE HEARD THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS. THOSE OWNER OPERATORS ARE OPERATING AT SUCH A DEFICIT THEY ARE OVERWHELMED AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A LOT OF TA. THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE IN STAKEHOLDER CALLS AND THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND PURCHASE A LITTLE SMALL. BOX TO DEAL WITH THE BED BUGS. THE SECOND IS YOU SEEN ON THE PAPERWORK TODAY THE BIGGEST REASON FOR. SITE BY CCL IS THE FACILITY ITSELF IS AN UP TO SNUFF WE NEED TO CALL. A ONE TIME PART. THE FOR EGGS OFFICE. TO MAY THE WHOLE ON BUT ALL ALLOW THE OVER CCA A MAN BECAUSE THEY KNOW BUT. LIFE IS ME IT IS IT WILL GIVE US FUNDING TO FIRST. WILL CAN FOR THEIR PROP. INCOME IT'S A ONE KERR. AND THEM AS THEY MADE WHOLE MONTH IT WOULD BE A TERM. THE AFTER WE DONE THE THEY WE CAN GO INTO BETTER SUPPORT AND QUALITY PROGRAMMING FOR OPERATORS THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE I'M TYLER IN THE WITH THE COUNTY BEHALF OR CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR IT YOU KNOW HOLDING THIS HEARING ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT- TOPIC AROUND THE IN A VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT ARE WITHIN IMPORTING CARE FACILITIES- AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THINK THAT. COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING HER TO MEMBERS DR SHARON AND I'M KAREN OURS FOR BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT YOU KNOW OUR PERSPECTIVE ON BOARDING CARE FACILITIES WE DO KNOW THAT- FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON THE ACCESS I RATE TO THAT THE REPEAT IS NOT- DOES NOT MEET THE- NEEDS OF THE I'M FACILITIES TODAY THE RATE. IS ABOUT HALF OR LESS WHAT THE ACTUAL COST OF PROVIDING BOARDING CARE FOR OUR RESIDENTS- WITH YOURS MENTAL ILLNESS. AND WE SEE THAT WITH THIS- INADEQUACY WITHIN THE RATES- AND THE RATE STRUCTURE THAT IT LEADS TO THE LOSS OF PHAM SSI BATS ACROSS THE- ACROSS THE STATE AND- THIS IS LEADING TO AN AND BURDEN OUTCOMES AND STOP FOR WE HAVE MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AN INPATIENT SETTINGS AND INSTITUTIONAL CARE. I'M A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TRANSITION OUT OF AND- ON THE STREETS. THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THIS WOULD BE A GREAT- SPOT. YOU AT HAVE GREAT OKAY AN ABORT OFFICER. A I'M WILL BE BREAKING FOR A TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE A- BY RICK. THAT WE CLOSE BOND ALONG THE FEINBERG INSTITUTE AND OUR COUNTY ARE. YOU KNOW INCREASE IN. FOR BOARDING SO. TO ADDRESS.
