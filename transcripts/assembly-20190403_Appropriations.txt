DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE IN OPPOSITION SORRY ABOUT THAT SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBER SILVIO FOR HIM TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS -- FIRST WELL THE BILL I THINK THAT THE FACT SHEET THE DISCUSSION ON THE BILL HAS TALKED A LOT ABOUT COMMERCIAL HOSPITALS. THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTIAL IS REAL AND IT'S BIG. IF FOR INSTANCE MANY OF OUR PROJECTS TEAM UP AND PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE STATE ON A NUMBER OF VARIOUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING -- TO FURTHER REDUCE ENERGY -- ENERGY EFFICIENCY CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM SOLAR PROGRAMS BATTERY STORAGE PROGRAMS. IF THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THOSE INCENTIVES IN OF THE PROJECT NOW TRIGGER TO INNER CITY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT PROJECT ACROSS THE BOARD IS PREVAILING WAGE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MINIMUM OF EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DOOR AS APPLIES TO RESIDENTIAL OR RENTAL. SO I KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS IMPACTING OTHER TYPES OF OF CONSTRUCTION BUT THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTIAL REAL. I THINK THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS -- WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT RESIDENTIAL -- HAVEN'T HEARD THE AUTHOR TALK ABOUT RESIDENTIAL I THINK WE CAN CARVE IT OUT OR WE CAN JUST GO FOR TO CODIFY THE 2% WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT IT HAS BEEN USE ROUTINELY BEAT BY THE D. I. R.. THEY HAVE COME FORWARD AND SO THEY DON'T USE THERE'S A PROBLEM -- AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD EVEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO THIS BILL TWICE BEFORE HIS SAID THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A PROBLEM. SO WE WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER FOLKS IN OPPOSITION. IN A FINANCE. NO FILE DOCTOR PARK DOES HAVE A QUESTION. YES IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT. THERE ARE TWO PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FULLY PERMITTED RESIDENTIAL HIGH DENSITY PRODUCTS PROJECTS NEAR TRANSIT IN MY DISTRICT -- AND THEY'RE NOT BEING BUILT IN THERE NOT BEING BUILT BECAUSE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH -- I HAVE PROJECTS IN EACH OF MY CITIES THAT ARE NOT BEING BUILT BECAUSE THE COSTS ARE TOO HIGH -- RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE BEING SQUEEZED I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THIS BILL IN DETAIL BUT THAT THE THE EXTENT IT WOULD. STOP RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS WHICH FRANKLY FOOT RAISED COSTS IS COSTS I THINK IT WOULD I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK MR ROVE. MADAM CHAIR -- I AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT WE WANT TO PAY WORKERS MORE MONEY. PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT IT ACTUALLY COST TO BUILD A HOME WE HAVE LUMBAR TAXES IN CAP AND TRADE INCREASES STUCCO AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SOLAR ON THE ROOF AND OPEN SPACE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT IMPACT FEES ARE HUGE -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BILL WHERE MAYBE WE ELIMINATE SOME OF THE BUREAUCRATIC MONIES TO COST. IN THE CHURCH AND AND PAY WORKERS MORE WHO WERE WORKING ESPECIALLY IN MY AREA THEY CAN'T WORK AND LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND AND A HOME THE BILL. I WOULD RATHER GIVE THE WORKER MONEY AND ELIMINATE A LOT OF THIS GOVERNMENT -- PERMIT FEES AND OPEN SPACE AND SEEK WAS ALL THAT STUFF SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE ON ELIMINATING SOME OF THE BUREAUCRATIC -- BARRIERS AND THEN WE CAN PAY WORKERS MORE MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER ROWE. YEAH WE'LL BRING YOU THAT BILL WILL WORK ON IT TOGETHER PAY WORKERS MORE. I LIKE THAT. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SEQUEL STUFF BUT ALL RIGHT WITH THAT I SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS -- MYSTERY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS I THINK WE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT ON THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEEDS OF OUR SPECIFIC DISTRICTS. WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO HAVE ONE OF OUR THE WITNESSES AND IN SUPPORT RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS. WOULD WOULD YOU LIKE THERE'S NO NEED TO KNOW YOU CAN IF YOU'D LIKE OF A VERY BRIEF -- MANAGER MEMBERS I I THINK WHAT WITH THIS MISTAKE IN YOUR BY THE OPPOSITION SAYS TONIGHT IS THAT THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE QUALIFICATIONS OF WHAT TRIGGERS THE PREVAILING WAGE WHAT TYPE OF WORK. THIS IS JUST A PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT IS RECEIVED WHEN A PRIVATE DEVELOPER CHOOSES TO ACCEPT THAT PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED BY LAW TO ACCEPT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES AND THEY WANT TO BUILD HOUSING WITHOUT USING PUBLIC DOLLARS DOCTOR QUIRK I THINK THEY CAN ARE FREE TO DO THAT AS WELL. I'M NOT SEEING THEM. ALRIGHT WE WILL AND MOVE THIS DISCUSSION AS THIS BILL MOVES AS WELL BECAUSE THAT GETS OUT ON A. B. ROLL CALL WITH MR IDEA PUTTING I THINK. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR GLORIA.
