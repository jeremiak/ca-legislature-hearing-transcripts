00:57:25.775 --> 00:57:27.010
SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT STATE

PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIANS.

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.384
A SHIFT FROM FOCUSING ON

PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS TO

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.253

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:45.829
INTERNATIONAL SHIFT THAT STARTED

THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.263
ABOUT WHAT IS THE ADEQUATE

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:48.798
SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT

THINK THAT IS SUFFICIENT.

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:57.773
AND GIVEN TO THE RECOMMENDATION

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.241
IS ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:07:59.308 --> 01:08:02.611

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:20.062
YET I MEAN THAT IS THE ULTIMATE

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:21.397
QUESTION AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:21.931

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.305
POPULATION GROUP IS THERE A

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:17.373
PARTICULAR AREA IN THE STATE

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:18.974
THAT WE SOMEHOW MISTER WE JUST

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:19.842
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:20.709
REACH.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:21.477
UNFORTUNATELY WE WILL NOT KNOW

01:11:21.543 --> 01:11:23.479
THAT UNTIL WE GET TOWARDS THE

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:29.785
END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR TOWARD

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:32.187
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER TIME FRAME.

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:32.955
GOTCHA WELL JUST.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:33.756
TO CONCLUDE MY PERSPECTIVE -- I

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:34.456
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:35.424
MINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE

01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:36.458
BUDGET COMMITTEES AND NOW SYSTEM

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.059
THE NUMBER THAT THEY PUT OUT

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:37.393
HERE.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.961
I CERTAINLY KNOW JUST WITHIN THE

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:39.995
LAST DAY THEIR FAN.

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:41.130
A NUMBER OF REACTIONS OF THE

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.631
COMMUNITY ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:45.034
THE RIGHT NUMBER -- I BELIEVE

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.602
THAT EVERYONE REALLY BRINGS GOOD

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:47.970
FAITH AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.071
THAT THIS IS FUNDED THE WAY IT

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.472
OUGHT TO BE AND I THINK WHAT I

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.640
WOULD ASK.

01:11:51.707 --> 01:11:52.908
ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS BOTH

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.243
THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO THE

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:57.146
STAKEHOLDERS IS TO HELP US

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:59.081
UNDERSTAND HOW TO JUSTIFY WHAT

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.382
IS THE RIGHT NUMBER BECAUSE FROM

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.417
MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.651
I THINK THE ANSWER YOU GAVE IS

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:03.886
ALSO QUESTION I WOULD POSE TO

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.287
THE ADVOCATES OF LIKE WHAT IS

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.356
THAT CORRECT NUMBER -- MY HOPE

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:08.157
IS AS I SPOKE TO THE CHAIR

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:09.391
EARLIER ABOUT THIS IS WE MIGHT

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:10.359
BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS ITEM OVER

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:12.327
JUST BRIEFLY. TO GIVE A LITTLE

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.929
TIME FOR THAT MAY TURN OUT THAT

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.197
THE NUMBER THAT'S BEING PROPOSED

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:16.565
IS THE RIGHT NUMBER -- AS

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:18.567
SOMEONE WHO VERY MUCH WANTS AS I

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.235
THINK WE ALL DO TO ENSURE THAT

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.237
WE ARE COUNTING EVERYONE I JUST

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:23.572
WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT.

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.074
I DO ALSO THINK THERE WAS A

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.208
LITTLE BIT OF MISCOMMUNICATION

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:27.576
ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE SELECT

01:12:27.643 --> 01:12:28.977
COMMITTEE IN THIS COMMITTEE AND

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.913
WHERE COMMUNICATIONS WENT TO AND

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:32.548
MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN JUST GET

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:33.949
SOME FOLKS IN A ROOM AND JUST

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:35.918
REALLY TALK IT OUT -- BEFORE WE

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:38.153
GET TO A FINAL NUMBER BUT WE ALL

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.322
KNOW THAT THE DOWNSIDE RISK OF

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.924
OF NOT SPENDING ENOUGH FUNDS IS

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:43.859
VERY VERY INTENSE AND SO I JUST

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.027
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.562
IF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO COMES

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:49.131
TO BE WE HAVE A CITIZENSHIP

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.266

HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN A

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:53.602
LOT OF COMMUNITIES I DON'T WANT

US TO UNDER ESTIMATE WHAT WE

01:12:55.471 --> 01:12:58.373
NEED FOR THIS SO -- SO WITH THAT --

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.274
LOOK FOR TO FOR THE

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.242

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.011
TO THE RIGHT NUMBER AND AND

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.013
APPRECIATE THAT WORK.

SUGGEST WHEN YOU'RE FINDING

01:33:32.807 --> 01:33:33.674
BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S

01:33:33.741 --> 01:33:34.909
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:36.978

SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:57.465
IMPORTANT WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING --

01:33:57.531 --> 01:33:59.133

COUNTY BE REQUIRED TO SEEK

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.115
REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS FUNDING

01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:15.383
RATHER THAN HAVING THE FUNDING

01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:17.151
PROVIDED UP FRONT -- PART OF

01:34:17.218 --> 01:34:18.519
THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

01:34:18.586 --> 01:34:20.221
UNIQUE THING FOR US TO BE PAYING

01:34:20.287 --> 01:34:21.155
FOR THESE KINDS OF COST WE DON'T

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.757
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:23.657
HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE.

01:34:23.724 --> 01:34:26.527
AND THREE POINT FIVE MILLION IS

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:27.695
IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF FUNDING.

01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:28.362
THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS TO

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:29.663
MODIFY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.198
TO REFLECT THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:34:31.265 --> 01:34:32.233
GOALS SO WHAT WILL AS WAS

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.601
REFERENCE THERE'S TRAILER BILL

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:34.235
LANGUAGE THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.236
PROPOSAL.

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:36.570
IT ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.838
DISPOSING OF THIS PROPERTY

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:38.606
THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:39.940
TRADITIONAL SURPLUS PROPERTY

01:34:40.007 --> 01:34:41.008
PROCESS IN SOME WAYS IT'S

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:43.144
SIMILAR -- BUT ACTUALLY PROVIDES

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.513
EVEN BROADER AUTHORITY TO THE

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:46.647
DEAD DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:49.050
A PROVIDE SOME VERY BROAD GOALS --

01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:50.151
BUT NOT MUCH IN TERMS OF

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:52.319
SPECIFICITY -- AND IT THE

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.421
TRADITIONAL PROCESS HAVE KIND OF

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:55.022
A LOADING ORDER OF THINGS THAT

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:56.290
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND THAT'S

01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:58.592
ABSENT HERE -- SO WE THINK THAT

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:00.428
IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS SPECIFIC

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.530
GOALS THINGS LIKE -- ITS GOALS

01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:03.864
FOR ACHIEVING -- CERTAIN

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:05.166
OUTCOMES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:07.368
DISABLED COMMUNITY OR FOR

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:09.103
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THESE

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.738
COULD BE MADE MORE CLEAR.

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.474
I WE ALSO SUGGEST -- FOURTH THAT

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.309
THE TRAILER BILL BE AMENDED TO

01:35:15.376 --> 01:35:16.343
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:17.478
OVERSIGHT.

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:18.446
THIS COULD BE DONE FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:19.914
BY REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.916
COME BACK WITH A NOTIFICATION

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:23.918
PRIOR TO THE SALE OR A MONTH

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:25.052
FROM THE PROPERTY.

01:35:25.119 --> 01:35:25.853
AND THEN THE FIFTH

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.987
RECOMMENDATION IS JUST TO

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.389
CONSIDER WHETHER THE

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:29.690
LEGISLATURE'S COMFORTABLE WITH --

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.258
THE POTENTIAL PRESIDENT THAT

01:35:31.325 --> 01:35:32.760
THIS COULD SAT I SO THIS

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.395
PROPERTY IS QUITE UNIQUE WHICH

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:35.362
IS ONE OF THE REASONS THE

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:36.564
DEPARTMENT IS COMFORTABLE WITH

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:39.033
TAKING THIS APPROACH -- BUT THIS

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.568
IS AN UNUSUAL APPROACH JUST THE

01:35:40.634 --> 01:35:42.002
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S INVOLVED

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:43.704
IS UNUSUAL PLAYING PAYING FOR

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:44.305
THESE LOCAL PLANNING COST IS

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:46.640
UNUSUAL AND ALSO -- THE PROCESS

01:35:46.707 --> 01:35:48.342
IT'S ENVISIONED IN THAT TRAILER

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:49.477
BILL LANGUAGE I SAID CERTAINLY

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:54.748
OTHER COMMUNITIES COULD COULD

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.383
MAKE SIMILAR ASKS IN THE FUTURE.

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:57.685
THANK YOU.

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:58.819
WITH THE PROPER TRANSITION THE

01:35:58.886 --> 01:36:00.554
D. G. S. WAS THE MOST LIKELY

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:01.589
FINAL USABLE AND IT WILL DEPEND

01:36:01.655 --> 01:36:02.890
ALTERNATELY ON WHAT THE FINAL

01:36:02.957 --> 01:36:04.024
REZONING IS -- WE DO AND IT IS A

01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:06.260
PAID COMMERCIAL USE -- AS WELL

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:08.195
AS HOUSING BOTH -- MARKET AND

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.797
AFFORDABLE -- THERE WILL BE

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:11.465
OTHER LOCALIZED PACIFIC USES

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.200
THERE IS A CEMETERY ON CAMPUS

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:14.368
AND SO THAT WERE MAIN AS SUCH --

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.203
THEY'RE LIKELY BE MUSEUM --

01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:17.338
THEY'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER

WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT WHEN LAW

01:53:43.183 --> 01:53:44.984
ENFORCEMENT SEARCH SEARCH

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:45.552
WARRANTS TYPICALLY MINISTRY

01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:47.287
SEARCH WARRANTS THEY GO AND

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:48.121
BECAUSE THEY ARE COLLECTED TO

01:53:48.188 --> 01:53:48.755
THE?

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:50.190
IF THE POWER GRID ILLEGALLY THEY

01:53:50.256 --> 01:53:51.191
SHUT THAT DOWN LEAVE THE

01:53:51.257 --> 01:54:00.200
MARIJUANA IN THERE YES I WOULD

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:02.202
HOPE THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT

01:54:02.268 --> 01:54:03.536
WORKS WITH THAT TO TRY SECURE

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.405
LEGISLATION WE'RE LAW FOR

01:54:05.471 --> 01:54:06.005
SHIPPING GOING TO DESTROY THE

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:06.339
MIDDLE EAST.

01:54:06.406 --> 01:54:07.407
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IF LAW

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:07.907
ENFORCEMENT LEAVES THAT

01:54:07.974 --> 01:54:09.809
MARIJUANA IN THOSE HOUSES IT

01:54:09.876 --> 01:54:10.443

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.843
MARKET.

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:11.711

01:54:11.778 --> 01:54:12.245
LEGAL MARKET IS IMPORTANT

01:54:12.312 --> 01:54:13.346

ILLEGAL MARKET.

01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:20.386
LEGAL MARKET CONTINUES TO THRIVE

01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:21.521
AND GROW WHICH UNDER BECAUSE

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:22.822
LEGAL PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:24.190

01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:24.791
THREATENED TO PUT THEM OUT OF

THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOLKS ARE

01:54:29.062 --> 01:54:30.263

MARKET ONE FOR THE LEGAL MARKET.

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:35.268
ON THAT ISSUE SO IT'S A REAL

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:37.403
IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM ANDYOU'RE

01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:39.405
TACKLING A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:42.375
IT BUT BY FAR THE VAST MAJORITY

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:44.010
IS ILLEGAL MARKETING.

01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:45.645
NELSON THESE FOLKS A PLAN IN

02:01:26.612 --> 02:01:29.715
OF TAXPAYER SERVED AND THE

02:01:29.782 --> 02:01:34.420
PROCESS -- WE HAVE IT IT'S WE

02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:35.955
HAVE NOT HAD AS MANY HEARINGS IN

02:01:36.022 --> 02:01:36.889
THE FIRST YEAR.

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:39.392
THERE WAS A RAMP UP PERIOD AND

02:01:39.458 --> 02:01:41.827
IF BEGINNING AROUND DECEMBER OF

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:42.662
LAST YEAR IT'S STARTING TO

02:01:42.728 --> 02:01:43.796
INCREASE.

02:01:43.863 --> 02:01:46.165
SO THAT THEY WERE FOCUSING ON IF --

02:01:46.232 --> 02:01:47.733
INCOME TAX IF THE FOR PERHAPS

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.870
YES BUT AS FAR AS FOR OUR CASES

02:01:50.936 --> 02:01:52.638
WITH CD TFA WE'RE STARTING TO

02:01:52.705 --> 02:01:55.708
SEE A ROLL OUT AND AS THEY USE --

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.743
ARE IMPLEMENTING THEIR PROCESSES

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:58.577
WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE

02:01:58.644 --> 02:01:59.512
HEARINGS.

02:01:59.578 --> 02:02:01.247
SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:07.086
TRANSPARENCY AND SOME LIKE --

02:02:07.153 --> 02:02:07.987
WHAT'S BEEN A DIFFERENCE IN THE

02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:10.556
PUBLISHED OPINIONS. ONE BECAUSE

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:11.190
THERE ARE THEIR WORK PUBLISHED

02:02:11.257 --> 02:02:13.125
OPINIONS BEFORE SO THAT'S A HUGE

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:16.195
DIFFERENCE -- IT'S A CHANCE FOR

02:02:16.262 --> 02:02:18.464
PEOPLE TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:19.565
REASONING THE LOGIC THAT GOES

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.200
INTO THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE.

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:22.935
AS OPPOSED TO BEFORE UNDER THE

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:24.070
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THERE WAS

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:26.172
SIMPLY A DECISION WITH NO

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:29.241
EXPLANATION BECAUSE OF MY EX

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:29.809
PARTE COMMUNICATION WHAT.

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:31.043
THIS PERHAPS BECAUSE THAT BUT

02:02:31.110 --> 02:02:32.178
ALSO BECAUSE THE BOARD DID NOT

02:02:32.244 --> 02:02:33.612
TYPICALLY PUBLISHER WRITTEN

02:02:33.679 --> 02:02:36.282
DECISION SO IT WAS SIMPLY DONE

02:02:36.348 --> 02:02:37.750
WITH AN IRON ARE NAY THERE AT

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.185
THE BOARD AND SO YOU WOULDN'T.

02:02:39.251 --> 02:02:40.553
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE NECESSARILY

02:02:40.619 --> 02:02:43.489
KNOW WHY OR WHAT THEIR LOGIC WAS

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.057
AND NOW HERE EVERYTHING CAN BE

02:02:45.124 --> 02:02:48.661
EXAMINED -- IF IF WE WERE.

02:02:48.728 --> 02:02:49.862
TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:51.997
DECISION OR IF THE TAXPAYER WERE

02:02:52.064 --> 02:02:53.065
TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH A DECISION.

02:02:53.132 --> 02:02:54.734
THEY SEE THE LOGIC LAID OUT IN

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.469
FRONT OF THEM AND THEY CAN FILE

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:58.337
A PETITION FOR REHEARING.

02:02:58.404 --> 02:03:00.973
SO IT I AS I SAID I THINK IT

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.709
MAKES A PROCESS THAT IS.

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:07.813

02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:32.304

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:43.248
WORK WITH THEM -- TO LOOK AT THE

02:08:43.315 --> 02:08:45.217
RISK OF LITIGATION AND TO WORK

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:48.487
ON A SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL.

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:50.589
AND WHICH THEY DEVELOP A NUMBER

02:08:50.656 --> 02:08:53.358
THAT IN ESSENCE ALLOWS.

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:54.993
THEM TO AS WITH STATE BEFORE

02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.662
ACCELERATE THE REVENUE FOR THE

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:58.197
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT.

02:08:58.263 --> 02:08:59.264
IT SHORT CUTS THAT

02:08:59.331 --> 02:09:01.500
ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS

02:09:01.567 --> 02:09:03.902
PROVIDE CERTAINTY AND THEN --

02:09:03.969 --> 02:09:05.737
PUTS AN END OF THAT PROCESS TO

02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:09.641
IT IT'S A MEANS WHICH IT CAN.

02:09:09.708 --> 02:09:10.943
REDUCE THE COSTS.

02:09:11.009 --> 02:09:13.011
RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH AN

02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:14.513
EXTENSIVE ADMINISTAFF'S BEER.

02:09:14.580 --> 02:09:15.681
FOR THE TAXPAYER IN FOR THE

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:17.850
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR BOTH

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:19.618
BECAUSE I THINK.

02:09:19.685 --> 02:09:20.886
I'VE SPENT TWENTY YEARS WORKING

02:09:20.953 --> 02:09:23.155
ON ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS AND I

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:24.056
THINK ONE THING THAT PEOPLE

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:25.958
FORGET OR THEY SOMETIMES DON'T

02:09:26.024 --> 02:09:27.559
FOCUS ON THEIR COSTS FOR

02:09:27.626 --> 02:09:28.794
TAXPAYERS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:09:28.861 --> 02:09:29.661
APPEAL.

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:31.130
IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE OF

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:33.499
CALIFORNIA SO IF PEOPLE UTILIZE

02:09:33.565 --> 02:09:35.634
THE SETTLEMENT BUREAU THEY CAN

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:36.802
ALLOW THEM.

02:09:36.869 --> 02:09:39.338
TO AT THEIR OWN WILL THEY CAN

02:09:39.404 --> 02:09:42.141
REDUCE THEIR COSTS AS WELL.

02:09:42.207 --> 02:09:47.479
SO HOW'S THAT HOW HOW -- HOW

02:09:47.546 --> 02:09:50.382
REGULAR HAS THE ENGAGEMENT AND I

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:51.683
WANT TO PUT WORDS IN SO?

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:53.185
HAS THERE BEEN A REGULAR

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:54.786
ENGAGEMENT WITH TAXPAYERS HAS

02:09:54.853 --> 02:09:56.188
THERE BEEN AN INCREASE IN

02:09:56.255 --> 02:10:00.125
REGULAR ENGAGEMENT -- BY ARE YOU

02:10:00.192 --> 02:10:01.260
BY ENGAGEMENT YOU MEAN LIKE

02:10:01.326 --> 02:10:02.895
PERSONAL INTERACTION OR DO YOU

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:05.230
MEAN SIMPLY SETTLEMENT -- THE

02:10:05.297 --> 02:10:07.065
NEEDLE IN SETTLEMENT THROUGH THE

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:09.968
PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE FAILED --

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:12.437
HOUSE THEY CHANGED.

02:10:12.504 --> 02:10:14.406
IT'S WELL IT THE ADVANTAGE THAT

02:10:14.473 --> 02:10:16.341
WE HAVE IS WITH AN OFFICE IN

02:10:16.408 --> 02:10:17.743
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT AT LAW IT

02:10:17.809 --> 02:10:20.078
ALLOWS FOR PERSONAL INTERACTION

02:10:20.145 --> 02:10:22.247
AND IT ALLOWS -- FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:23.815
BECAUSE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A

02:10:23.882 --> 02:10:24.750
PROFESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE

02:10:24.816 --> 02:10:26.985
SOMETIMES IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL OF

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:29.154
HIS OR HER OWN ACCORD COMING IN.

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:32.024
AND WANTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:33.091
IT AND SO IT'S NOT.

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:33.792
I THINK ONE OF THE UNIQUE THINGS

02:10:33.859 --> 02:10:38.130
WE HAVE IT'S IT'S NOT A OVERLY

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:40.933
FORMAL PROCESS IT ALLOWS AN

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:43.135
INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS PERSON AND

02:10:43.202 --> 02:10:44.636
MANY OF THESE BUSINESS PEOPLE

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:46.605
ARE SMALL. FOR LIKE A BETTER

02:10:46.672 --> 02:10:47.372
DESCRIPTION MOM AND POP

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:49.841
BUSINESSES OFTEN HAVE GONE OUT

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:51.476
OF BUSINESS AND INFO HERE

02:10:51.543 --> 02:10:52.411
ANYWHERE TO COLLECT SO IT GIVES

02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:55.247
THEM AND AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO

02:10:55.314 --> 02:10:57.182
HAVE PERSONAL INTERACTION AND TO

02:10:57.249 --> 02:10:58.817
DO IT IN A MUCH QUICKER FASHION

02:10:58.884 --> 02:10:59.818
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE MEETING IN

02:10:59.885 --> 02:11:02.421
PERSON A ITS EASIER THAN --

02:11:02.487 --> 02:11:04.356
DOING SO BY MAIL OR EVEN BY

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:06.258
PHONE BECAUSE YOU'RE ABLE TO EXT

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:07.826
IF YOU HAVE THE RECORDS THERE.

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:09.561
YOU CAN ADDRESS IT INSTANTLY AS

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:11.997
OPPOSED -- TO TAKING DAYS OR

02:11:12.064 --> 02:11:13.532
WEEKS SO IT'S LESSEN THE ANXIETY

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:16.468
AND THE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYER.

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:17.603
I WILDLY HOLDS US.

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:21.640
I WOULD HOPE SO MORE DIRECTLY

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:23.308
ACCESSIBLE.

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:24.543
MISTER CHAIR IF YOU CAN ALLOW ME

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:25.344
FOR A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:28.247
ABSOLUTELY -- SO.

02:11:28.313 --> 02:11:29.881
IF IF WITHOUT THESE NEW

02:11:29.948 --> 02:11:30.949
POSITIONS WHAT SORT OF

02:11:31.016 --> 02:11:32.684
REPERCUSSIONS.

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:35.454
WOULD THERE BE.

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:38.056
IT IT IT WILL IT WILL I AM THE

02:11:38.123 --> 02:11:39.591
SEMINAL INCREASE OUR WORKLOAD IN

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:40.892
THAT WE WOULD LOSE THE SIX

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.694
POSITIONS AND IT COULD

02:11:42.761 --> 02:11:44.363
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO A BACKLOG

02:11:44.429 --> 02:11:47.199
WHICH WOULD MEAN -- SETTLEMENTS

02:11:47.266 --> 02:11:49.968
NOT BEING HANDLED THIS TIMELY --

02:11:50.035 --> 02:11:51.637
TAXPAYERS NOT GETTING THEIR

02:11:51.703 --> 02:11:53.105
RESOLUTION IS TIMELY.

02:11:53.171 --> 02:11:55.140
SO IN DOING SO IT AFFORDS

02:11:55.207 --> 02:11:56.675
INCREASED REVENUE TO THE STATE

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:57.909
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:11:57.976 --> 02:12:00.812
INCREASED CERTAINTY TO TAXPAYERS

02:12:00.879 --> 02:12:02.381
AND I'M ASSUMING IT MAKES.

02:12:02.447 --> 02:12:06.318
ONCE THEY COMPLETE THEIR

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:09.021
ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER I'M SURE

02:12:09.087 --> 02:12:09.655
THAT MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM AS

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:10.856
WELL.

02:12:10.922 --> 02:12:12.424
IT JUST REDUCES THEIR ANXIETY

02:12:12.491 --> 02:12:13.725
BUT I THINK I'D BE BELIEVE BRING

02:12:13.792 --> 02:12:15.794
THE POINT IF I A ASKED YOU TO

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:17.429
MAKE A COMPARISON AND COMPARE

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:18.897
CONTRAST.

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:20.565
BETWEEN THE PROCESS YOU HAVE NOW

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:24.036
FOR SETTLEMENT VERSUS THE OF THE

02:12:24.102 --> 02:12:28.440
