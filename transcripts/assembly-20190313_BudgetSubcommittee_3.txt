AND DEADLY AND DAMAGING SEASON THAT WE'VE HAD AND IT'S REALLY WAS A FIRE YEAR AS WE'VE BEEN SEEING -- IN THE IN THE RECENT HISTORY -- I'M JUST GOING TO REMIND YOU OF THE FOR KIND OF CAPSTONE OR CORNERSTONE FIRES THAT OCCURRED LAST YEAR THE MEDICS MENDOCINO COMPLEX. NOW THE LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. THE CAR -- WHICH BURNED OR XIN OF OF READING AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS. AND THE AND THEY HAD A A EXTREME WEATHER EVENT -- INDIA -- FOR CATEGORY TORNADO LIKE A FIRE WORLD -- SOMETHING WE HAD NOT SEEN BEFORE. OTHER WILL SEE FIRE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BURNS -- INTO MALIBU RIGHT TO THE BEACH BURNED. TEN MILES OF COASTLINE RIGHT DOWN TO THE SAND IN SOME CASES. AND THEN OF COURSE THE CAMP FIRE WHICH WAS -- THE RIDGE THAT INCLUDES A PARADISE -- CON CAO MAHALIA AND OTHER COMMUNITIES AND AND THE REASON I'M BRINGING THIS BACK TO ATTENTION IS THESE THOUGH THEY ARE THE MOST NOTABLE THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY FIRES THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND LAST YEAR WAS. ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRES WORTH OF OF WILDFIRE THE REALLY DEVASTATED PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. AND SOME OF THE NOTABLE THING -- WE HAVE AN ARE ATTRIBUTING TO CUT CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED TO THIS -- IS WELL CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE THE EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHT THAT -- A IS NOT OVER FOR THE VEGETATION THE VEGETATION IS STILL -- DEAD OR OR STRESSED AND WILL NOT COME BACK IN OVERNIGHT FROM THESE RAINS WE'VE BEEN HAVING -- THIS WINTER -- WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DROUGHT LIKE CONDITIONS IN THE FUELS -- IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME FOR LARGE FUELS TO TAKE ON MORE EACH JUROR AND REDUCE THE THE THREAT OF THEM BURNING -- AND DOES IT THIS IS THE STAGE THAT -- WE BRING THESE PROPOSALS TO YOU UNDER [inaudible] THE IN PARTICULAR -- ON THE CAMP INCIDENT THE FIRE STARTED IN AN AREA WHERE A RECENT FIRE HAD BURNED AND THERE WERE HAVE YOU EVERY FUELS IT BURNED TO THE RICH -- WIND CONDITIONS DRY WIND CONDITIONS THAT WERE HAPPENING. AT A POINT IN THE YEAR WHERE WE USUALLY HAVE AT TWO TO FOUR INCHES OF RAIN IN THE AREA. WHICH WOULD HAVE STARTED TO TO TO GREEN UP AND AND VOICE IN THE FUELS THE SAME TIME THAT THAT WIND WAS BLOWING OVERNIGHT. NEEDLES WERE FALLING OUT OF THE PINE TREES TYPICAL ANNUAL EVENT. SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF OF PARADISE WOULD HAVE RAKED OR MOVE REMOVED THE THE FUEL STRUCTURES IT ALL CAME BACK OVERNIGHT. AND THE EMBERS FROM THESE HEAVY FUELS THAT WERE STILL VERY BONE DRY -- ON THAT ON THAT PREVIOUS FIRE LANDSCAPE. SHOWERED INTO PARADISE -- JUST HOURS SHORT HOURS AFTER -- IGNITION OF THE FIRE -- PUTTING THE FIRE IN PARADISE FROM A DISTANCE THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE TAKEN SIX TO EIGHT HOURS. SO IT MOVED TO FIRE VERY QUICKLY INTO TOWN THAT NEEDLE CAST ALLOWED FOR THE FIRE TO SPREAD IN TOWN VERY QUICKLY. AND THEN THE REST OF THE STORY YOU'VE HEARD AND YOU KNOW BUT THESE ARE THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE. THAT HAVE A REALLY COME OUT IN THE IN THE BROADER -- PUBLIC STORY AND I I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO WHERE WORK -- TO WHERE WE'RE GOING. SO. WITH THAT BEING THE THE STAGE. I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS -- LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR FOR YOU CHAIR AND IF YOU CARE TO COME BY TOPICS. WHO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO BRING THEM UP THROUGH FURTHER TESTIMONY. GREAT HI ALISON YOU IT. NINETY SAID WELCOME. WHICH MEANS CO AUTHOR OF RIGHT. I ALISON HERE AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT SAID MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT AND SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A COMPREHENSIVE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RECOVERY PACKAGE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT THIS PACKAGE THIS INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR CAL FIRE TWO HUNDRED MILLION CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SB NINE A ONE AS WELL AS TEN MILLION -- TO IMPLEMENT OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATION AND THEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE THEIR RESOURCES BOARD.

THANK YOU WHO'S NEXT. SO WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO CHIEF PORTER. I DON'T KNOW THE ORDER GOING AND SO. WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT WILL KEEP IT COMING. ALL RIGHT -- RELATED -- TO THE THE AND AND THIS IS RELATED TO ON ON YOUR IN YOUR PACKET ON PAGE SIX THE THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE THERE -- TO TO MEET THE NEEDS -- FOR THERE WERE OUTLINED IN -- THE SENATE BILL NINE A ONE SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY ASSEMBLY BILL -- FOR TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN THE BILL -- TWENTY NINE ELEVEN CAL FIRE IS REQUESTING -- TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS -- FOR TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAMS -- THE THE FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THOSE BILLS -- AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL ON EACH ONE BECAUSE YOU HAVE THEM IN YOUR PACKET THE THE THE RIGHT UP AYE I BELIEVE STAFF DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF OF WRITING UP THE THE SPECIFICS THERE. AND SO IN IN LIGHT OF A LONG AGENDA AND SHORT TIME -- I WOULD LIKE -- TO JUST -- KICK THAT BACK -- TO YOU CHAIR IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET THROUGH THE REST OF THE THE DIRECTORS AND THEIR PIECES OF THIS PERSON -- I I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. IS ANYONE ELSE. PLEASE PROCEED -- TO AFTER THOSE RATES. AS A MEMBER OF THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. ON SB NINE A ONE I'M REALLY GLAD TO THEY WERE ENTERING INTO THE CRITICAL JUNCTURE WE'RE WE'RE INSURING THAT THE MONEY THAT THE ASSEMBLY. PROPOSES -- TO TO BE USED IT TO HELP ADDRESS. OF THIS CRISIS OF THE WILDFIRE IS BEING USED. I KNOW THAT -- THE ALLOCATION TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. WHAT WHAT IS CAL FIRE DOING TO ENSURE THAT RATHER THEN PICKING THE BEST GRANT APPLICATION? THAT WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE AREAS OF NEED. ESPECIALLY THE HIGH RISK AREAS RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT IT. GOOD GOOD APPLICATION. THAT IS THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT RELATED TO THIS THIS REQUESTED THIS WILL GIVE US THE THE STAFF TO CONTINUE TO HELP DOING THAT WE DO HAVE A A A A GRANT -- PROGRAM THAT LOOKS AT THE THE THE MERITSOF OF EACH PROJECT -- THE GEOGRAPHIC'S -- WE'RE WE'RE ALSO INCLUDING -- ITEMS FROM THE COMMUNITY WHAT -- PREVENTING COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT -- IT LOOKING AT SOCIO ECONOMIC HOW MANY CHILDREN OR IN IN THE COMMUNITY NUMBER OF VEHICLES PER -- PER HOUSEHOLD. OR NO VEHICLES PER HOUSEHOLD ELDERLY THOSE KIND OF THINGS WHAT WE'VE WRAPPED ALL OF THOSE INTO MAKING THESE. THE THE ALLOCATION -- DESIGNED FOR THESE FUNDS AND WE'RE BEING MUCH MORE TARGETED TO WHERE THE VULNERABLE NEED IS -- AND IN AS WE ROLL THOSE FORWARD -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION THAT A DOLLARS THAT ARE -- GOING OUT TO FOREST'S -- FORCED HEALTH TYPE PROJECT WORK. AND AND THEN FIRE PREVENTION IS THE BALANCE. IT VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THE THE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION. IS THERE ALL OF WORKING ON THE PRODUCTION FOR THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS ON WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO DO -- TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO THAT POINT. YES IT'S ALL ABOUT IT'S IT'S ALL PART OF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO LOOKING AT AND WHEN I SAY FIRE PREVENTION THOSE ARE THOSE ARE TYPICALLY COME. COMMUNITY BASED OR OR MORE LOOKING AT PROXIMITY TO THE COMMUNITIES AND PROTECTION OF LIVES AND PROPERTY THE FOREST HEALTH -- APPLICATIONS ARE FOR OUR FURTHER OUT IN THEIR THEIR FOREST HEALTH AND RESILIENCE -- PROJECTS ALL OF THEM ARE ARE GEARED TOWARD FOREST HEALTH AND AND RESILIENT FORESTS. BUT THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN THAT WILL IN ONE AREA WE'RE TRYING TO PURCHASE FIRST. WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT WATERSHED AND ON THE AND NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AND THEN THE OTHER PLACE WERE TRYING TO PROTECT THE THE COMMUNITY. AND TO DO THE OTHER ALL OF THESE ARE SYSTEMATIC -- SYSTEMATICALLY AND HOLISTICALLY -- DEPENDED ON EACH OTHER FOR FOR A HEALTHY FOREST ECOSYSTEM WITH HUMANS RESIDING WITHIN. IN MY FINAL QUESTION BEFORE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN BY SAYING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE HARD WORK. OF YOURSELF AND ALL OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS. IT'S I AM PROUD TO HAVE YOU LEADING INTO TO KNOW THAT -- OUR COMMUNITIES ARE IN GOOD HANDS THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT HARD WORK. THANK THAT MIGHT MY FINAL QUESTION IS WITH WITH THE MONEY'S COMING IN FROM THE PC -- BOTH OF THE FROM PIECING CAL FIRE -- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DUPLICATE? EFFORTS SO THAT IT WE DON'T USES THE SAME -- FUNDING FOR WHAT YOU USE FUNDING WITH DIFFERENT SOURCES FOR THE SAME THING WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T DUPLICATING THE WE USE THAT YOU WERE USING THE MONEY IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. MEMORIES OF ANOTHER VERY FINE QUESTION. WE WE ARE COORDINATING OUR GRANT PROGRAMS AND IT'S NOT JUST BE YOU SEE -- TO SEE IF YOU SEE AND CAL FIRE BUT ALSO -- OUR OTHER -- SISTER DEPARTMENTS IN WE WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO COORDINATE OUR GRANT PROGRAMS SO THAT THEIR COMPLIMENTARY -- NOT SILOS BUT ALSO LOOKING AT AT AREAS WHERE WE CAN HELP FUND PROJECTS THAT THAT -- FIND THAT THAT FIND A WAY. TO DEVELOP A CRITICAL MASS OF GOOD WORK IN. IN WATERSHEDS THAT NEEDED AND AROUND COMMUNITIES THAT NEED. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THEN WHY DON'T WE MOVE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS.

REQUIRING AN INCREASE IN PC STAFF WITH SPECIFIC SETS OF EXPERTISE I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO THE STAFF FEATURES I'M MORE HAPPY -- TO I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU BUT MORE ATTITUDE -- AGAIN SB NINE ONE ESTABLISHES AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA -- PAST SUCH PERMANENT POSITIONS ARE REQUIRED AND VITAL TO INSURER UTILITY WATER MITIGATION AND RESPONSE MEASURES ARE EVALUATED AND FORCED AND ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I COMPLETE MY STATEMENT ANY QUESTIONS FROM. THANK YOU OF I'M NOT SURE FOR A PUBLIC ADVOCATE WAS PLANNING ON MAKING A STATEMENT. THIS IS THE ARE -- FIRST FREE FORM HEARING OF THE OF THE YEAR. YOU SEE RIGHT HERE. I'M COMING BACK. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LIMóN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ELIZABETH ACKLES DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND I'M WITH HERE HERE WITH DOCTOR NATHANIEL SKINNER WHO IS A SUPERVISOR OVER OUR SAFETY SECTION. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON OUR BUDGET CHAIN TO PROPOSALS ASSOCIATED WITH SB NINE A ONE WE ARE REQUESTING FOURTEEN NEW POSITIONS TEN NEW STAFF POSITIONS AND FOR ATTORNEYS. TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE WILD FIRE SAFETY AND WILD PARK COST RECOVERY PROVISIONS OF SB NINE A ONE AS YOU KNOW SB NINE A ONE INSTITUTED SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS UPON THE SIX INVESTOR OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE SIGNIFICANT NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR OFFICE ARE IN TWO MAIN AREAS WILD FIRE SAFETY AND WILD FOR COST RECOVERY. EACH OF THESE EFFORTS HAS STATUTORILY MANDATED TIME LINES AND FREQUENCIES THAT REQUIRE US TO INCREASEOUR STAFFING TO MEET OUR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE UNDER PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THREE OH NINE POINT FIVE WHICH IS TO OBTAIN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE. RATE FOR SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. TWENTY FIRST TO THE WILD FOR SAFETY WE REQUESTED FIVE NEW POSITIONS TO REPRESENT RATE PAYERS AND THE CPC'S WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN PROCEEDINGS. THIS REQUIREMENT WILL REQUIRE THE EQUIVALENT OF TWELVE NEW PROCEEDINGS A YEAR IN WHICH WILL BE PARTICIPATING STARTING IN. TWENTY TWENTY ON NOTE THAT WE HER FILING OR OUR FIRST COMMENTS IN THAT WOULD UTILITIES WATER MITIGATION PLANS TODAY. AND GOING FORWARD THESE POSITIONS COMPLETELY EVALUATE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE RIGHT PAIR INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED. TURNING TO THE WILDFIRE COSTS AND FINANCIAL SECURITIZATION WE'VE REQUESTED FIVE NEW POSITIONS TO CONDUCT FINANCIAL ECONOMIC AND POLICY ANALYSIS OF THE REASONABLENESS OF UTILITY COSTS REQUESTS. AS WE'VE ALREADY DISCOVERED IN THE REVIEW OF P. GENIES WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND THEIR TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION THERE'S EXTENSIVE OVERLAP. FROM A PROGRAMMATIC PROJECT AND COST BASIS CONSISTENT WITH OUR STATUTORY MANDATE WE MUST ENSURE THE UTILITIES COSTS ARE REASONABLE AND THEY'RE NOT SEEKING COST RECOVERY FOR THE SAME PROGRAMS. IN DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS THE STAFF WILL ALSO PERFORM THE ANALYSES ASSOCIATE WITH RATE PAYER PROTECTION FINANCING UNDER SECTION. EIGHT FIFTY FINALLY REQUESTED FOR SENIOR COUNSEL POSITIONS TO PROVIDE LEGAL SUB SUPPORT IN PREPARING DISCOVERY PREPARE BRIEFS AND DEALING WITH THE NECESSARY LEGAL -- ASPECTS OF OUR ADVOCACY. AND THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED IN COORDINATION WITH THE COMMISSION'S LEGAL DIVISION. THE STAFF POSITIONS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF RATE PAYERS AND MEET THE PRECEDING SCHEDULES AND TIMING REQUIREMENT AND SB NINE A ONE THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND WE ARE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER PRESENTATIONS. BOB I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS -- A FIRST TERM. I'M WONDERING IF THE COMPLIANCE FUNCTION -- SO WITH THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER HOUSING THAT -- HI AT A AT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT LIKE CAL FIRE SINCE THE EFFORTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON UTILITY COMPLIANCE WITH THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. HI THAT ARE INTENDED TO HELP AVOID WILDFIRES IS MIGHT BE MORE ALIGNED WITH THE WORK THAT CAL FIRE IS CURRENTLY DOING. AND IS THAT AN INSURANCE FOR YOU YEAH. I'M THAT GERMAN SO IT IT THANKS FOR THE QUESTION -- INSIDE OF THE B. C. P. FOR A THE ENFORCEMENT OF IT COMPLIANCE ARE REQUESTING ELEVEN POSITIONS WITHIN OUR STATE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION -- RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THREE AND THE STAFF WORK CLOSELY WITH CAL FIRE READY TO ANIMAL YOU THROUGH THE WORKING GROUP. ON A DAILY BASIS -- TO INCLUDE CELLS -- I THOUGHT VITAL THAT THE PC HAVE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS OF THE UTILITIES WHICH WE CURRENTLY POSSESS -- TO ACTUALLY GO OUT THERE AND ASSIST CAL FIRE IS NEEDED AND RECEIVE CALPERS INPUT -- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S VITAL THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN BOOTS ON THE GROUND THERE CAN BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO THESE LOCATIONS AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE OF THE UTILITIES PLANS. OKAY WELL OF THANK YOU ACT OF THIS THIS ITEM IS BEING HELD OPEN -- SOLVE ALASKA'S STAFF -- TO YOU KNOW JUST INQUIRE LITTLE BIT MORE DEEPLY INTO THAT -- AND AND REPORT BACK TO ME AND THE AND THE COMMITTEE -- MY NEXT QUESTION IS -- THE POSITIONS [inaudible] AND TO CHAU ARE -- ARE REQUESTING A PERMANENT -- AND NOT OF LIMITED TERM. SINCE YOU. PROBABLY THERE'S PROBABLY SOME UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME AS TO THE YOU KNOW HOW THOSE POSITIONS Là ACTUALLY WORK OUT WHY ARE THEY ALL. PERMANENT INSTEAD OF SOME OF THE MAIN LIMITED TERM OR MAYBE ALL OF THEM BEING LIMITED -- TO RIGHT WELL WE ARE REQUESTING PERMANENT POSITIONS BECAUSE THE LEGISLATION WILL IN EFFECT REQUIRE TWELVE NEW PROCEEDINGS A YEAR OR REALLY SUB PARTS OF THAT A LARGER PROCEEDING BUT IN EFFECT TWELVE NEW PROCEEDINGS A YEAR AND SO WE NEED. THE FOLKS TO STAFF THAT THAT'S AN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ON GOING -- AND YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WE KNOW PERMANENTLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATION REQUIRES SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE REQUESTING PERMANENT POSITIONS. I AM AND MY BECAUSE OF PCA AYE IT'S AN ONGOING PROCESS YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE GETTING THE FIRST PLANS THIS YEAR WE EXPECT THOSE PLANS ARE GOING TO DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME WITH EACH YEAR AS WE LEARN BEST PRACTICES AND DEVELOPING. ALSO BASED ON THE SITUATION I MEAN CLIMATE CHANGE TO GROW INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO AGE AND OTHER THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN ADDITION WITH WHAT WE NEED TO TO ACCOMPLISH THROUGH SB NINE A ONE IT'S AN ANNUAL ONGOING REQUIREMENT. THAT WE DO NOT SEE GOING AWAY AM I CORRECT IT -- THAT ANOTHER WAY OF OF OF SAYING THAT IS THAT YOU EXPECT THE NEED ONLY TO GROW THEREFORE YOU PROBABLY NEED MORE POSITIONS AS TIME GOES ON THE POTENTIAL IS THERE. THE CLUB SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THE THE ISSUE THAT I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF ITS ONLY POTENTIAL -- IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE WORKLOAD AS WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW IT MIGHT DEBT BUT MICHAEL UP AND AND I DO NOT. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT OR DEBT -- I BELIEVE THAT WILL CONTINUE AND STEADY STATE IF NOT INCREASE -- FOR IT TO CLEAR REASONS OF AGAIN CLIMATE CHANGE AND AN EXPANDING POPULATION AND EXPANDING FOOTPRINT ON OUR STATE. AND AS NEW COMMITTED TO COMMUNITIES ARE BELT AND THE WILD LAND SUBURBAN INTERFACE GROWS. THE NEED FOR INCREASED STAFF WILL PROBABLY GROW WITH THAT. IT'S GOING TO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE TOYS ARE ACTUALLY LIVE AND IF I IN THIS ADD TO THAT WE KNOW BASED ON SB NINE OH ONE THAT AT A MINIMUM. EVERY UTILITY THE THREE BIG ONES AND THE THREE SMALL ONES NEED TO FILE THEIR PLANS EVERY YEAR BOTH THEIR WILD FOR MITIGATION PLAN AND THEN IN ADDITION THERE'S GOING TO BE A COMPLIANCE REVIEW. SO THAT IN EFFECT IS GOING TO BE TWELVE PROCEEDINGS EVERY YEAR -- IN IT ASIDE FROM WHETHER THE THE NEEDS WILL GROW BUT WE KNOW AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE THAT WORK LOAD ON GOING. ALL RIGHT THAT'S PERFECT SEGUE TO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS -- WHICH OF THE UTILITIES HAVE -- FILED THEIR WILDLIFE MITIGATION PLANS AT AT THIS ALL OF THEM SO FAR. AND AND WHAT'S THE STATUS OF OF THE PC REVIEW AND WHEN CAN WE EXPECT THAT REPORT ON US WE ARE FINALLY IN OUR COMMENTS TODAY COMMENTS ARE DUE TODAY AND THEN I'LL LET YOU ADDRESS AT CPAC SIDE SO THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN REVIEW -- WITH AN EXPECTED APPROVAL DATE IN MAY TO MEET THE NINETY NINE NINETY DAY DEADLINE PUT IN SB NINE A ONE WE RECEIVE INITIAL COMMENTS -- AND CONTINUING -- TO WE HAVE HELD THE BOTH WORKSHOPS WHERE THE UTILITIES GOT TO CALM AND EXPLAIN THEIR PLANS PRESENT THEM -- AND CONNECT YOU AN A ON IT SORT OF CURRENTLY IN REVIEW I'M A STAFF DEDICATED AT THE PC -- WE HAVE NINETEEN STAFF TOTAL RIGHT NOW THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER ARE WORKING WILD FIRE MITIGATION OR INVESTIGATORY EFFORTS RIGHT NOW. I'M OUT OF OUR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT ALONG I'M ENERGY DIVISION OTHER STATUS DISSIPATING AND THE REVIEW OF THE PLANS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER PATTERSON. GOV FOLLOW UP TO THAT QUESTION I'M JUST ASKING STRAIGHT OUT WILL THESE PLANS BE APPROVED ON TIME YES OR NO YES. THANK YOU. A COUPLE OTHER AT POINTS I'M. I MUST SAY I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED WITH RESPECT TO PRIORITIES WITHIN THE THESE BCP'S. SO NOTICING IN YOUR BUDGET A CHANGE PROPOSAL. YOU RANK WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RECOVERY. AS NUMBER FIFTEEN IN THAT RANKED LISTING. HOWEVER THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE. LISTS IT AS A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS ARE WE SUPPOSED TO READ ANYTHING INTO THIS. RANKING DISPARITY WITH RESPECT TO HOW HIGH YOU PLACE. THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND AND RECOVERY. I NOTICE IN THE B. C. P.. THAT THEY'RE UP [inaudible] APPARENTLY INVESTIGATING -- GARAGE DOOR OPENERS. IS A HIGHER PRIORITY IN THAT LISTING. THEN THIS. ONE SO YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY WE HAVE THIS DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE PUBLIC. ADVOCATE RANKING THIS AS THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THE P. YOU SEE RACKING AT AT FIFTEENTH AMONG WHAT TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE THE REQUEST. HELP ME UNDERSTAND. FOR ME UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF EXPLANATION FOR THIS. THIS TELLS ME THAT WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW IS RANKED VERY LOW ON YOUR PRIORITY LIST. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION IT ACTUALLY IS NOT RANKS LOW -- IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC DOES COMMISSION ORDER OF PRIORITY IT IS A TOP PRIORITY OF THE COMMISSION AS OF MOVE IT HAS BEEN FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW WE'VE BEEN LOOKING SQUARELY AT WILD FIRES DEDICATING RESOURCES DIRECTLY TO THE WATERS AND SO WHO ARE WE TO SAY THAT THE RANKINGS. HAVE ARE MEANINGLESS AT THAT THAT OF THE TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE LISTED RIGHT THERE THEY'RE ALL CO EQUAL. WITH RESPECT TO THE ENERGY FOCUS AND TIMELINESS OF THE PC. WE DO OUR BEST TO BE TIMELY AND EVERY ASPECT THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING. WE DO PRIORITIZE. WILD FIRES RIGHT NOW ARE THE TOP PRIORITY THE TOP PRIORITY OF THE STATE THE TOP PRIORITY FOR OURSELVES IN THE TOP PRIORITY FOR THE STATE ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AS WELL AS THE OTHER DIVISIONS. IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITY LIST IT'S IN THE BCP -- I CAN SAY MAYBE IT WAS MISS PART MAYBE THAT LIST WAS A BAD IDEA MAY BUSINESS PRIVATIZED IN LIST ITSELF. BUT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS TAKING WATER PARKS EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY -- CAP. THE ANSWER BUT WE ARE SITTING HERE MAKING DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO PRIORITIZE LISTS. AND YOU HAVE THIS RANKED VERY LOW. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER YOUR RANKINGS MEAN ANYTHING. ARE WE SUPPOSED TO READ SOMETHING INTO THIS WHY WOULD YOU RANK THEM. IF THAT DID NOT SIGNAL TO US. A HIERARCHY OF PRIORITIES. AND ALL I CAN SAY TO THAT IS THAT RANKING LIST IS INCORRECT. THAT THE RANK IT DOUBLY IMPORTANT THING WANT A PIECE OF WHAT CAN YOU UP LET'S ALLOW HIM TO FINISH CATERING TO FIX THE LIST PUT THIS ON THE TOP. RIGHT AMOUNT LET'S I'M I'M DONE LIKE IF ASK YOUR QUESTION I'M DONE ASKING THE QUESTION AYE FISHER ANSWER -- THE PLEASE PLEASE DO FINISH YOUR ANSWER BARBARA I THANK JIM -- SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WILD FIRES BEYOND HAVING A DATE DEDICATED STAFF IF WE HAVE REALIZED THE P. YOU SEE. THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE B. AND FOR WHAT FIRE MITIGATION AND INVESTED INVESTIGATIONS. WE WEREN'T DESIGNED FOR IT AND WE LEARNED OUT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. AND WE HAVE UTILITY ENGINEERS AND POLICY ANALYSTS IN THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION BUT DO NOT HAVE WILD FIRE EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S WHAT'S LEFT VERY CLOSE COORDINATION AND RELATIONSHIP WITH CAL FIRE AND UTILIZING THEIR WALLET FOR EXPERTISE IN HELPING US UNDERSTAND HOW THE WILD FIRES ACTUALLY FUNCTION. AND AS WE BECOME EDUCATED ON THIS WE'VE REALIZED THESE ARE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WE NEED WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE DEDICATED THAT AREN'T YOU TOLD THE ENGINEERS. THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT LOOKING AT UTILITY POLES OR GENERATION FACILITIES OR GAS PIPELINES AND THEN ON THE SIDE A LITTLE WILD FIRES. THEY NEED TO LOOK AT WILD FIRES. COLLECTIVELY HOLY THAT IS THEIR JOB THAT IS OUR SOLE PURPOSE AT THE PC. AND AS WILL BECOMING MORE EDUCATED. OUR PRIORITIES ARE CHANGING WERE REALIZING HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT. TURN AYE AYE YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE. DO YOU INTEND TO CHANGE THE RANKINGS FOR FUTURE DELIBERATIONS BY THIS COMMITTEE OR THE LARGER BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND I'LL HAVE TO TAKE THAT BACK TO ENSURE THAT WE THAT WE MAKE SURE WE STAND BEHIND UNLESS I NEED TO TAKE THAT BACK THROUGH MY LEADERSHIP AND ENSURE THAT WE TAKE A HARD LOOK AT IT. AND IF A CHANGE DOZEN YOU MADE WE MAKE A CHANGE IN THE SENATE. I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT UP. THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION MAY DECIDE THAT A RANKING SYSTEM IS IT APPROPRIATE -- TO HI A TO THIS KIND OF RESPONSE AS FAR [inaudible] OKAY -- I ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. LET'S SET TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW -- WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS ENTIRE ITEMS THANKS. EVERYBODY WHO JUST STARTED TO GET UP SORRY ABOUT THAT. WILL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION CORPS. YOU'RE THE CHAIRMAN YOU CAN GO OVER. ONE I THANK I CAN CALL WHOEVER I WANT I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL GET A RESPONSE. SHARE WOULD IT BE HELPFUL TO GO THROUGH THE REMAINING ORDER OF THE DEPARTMENTS -- OR MAYBE YOU WANT TO CALL THEM UP. SURE I'M I'M HAPPY TO DO SO MISSION.

AND TO CREWS STILL TO BE DETERMINED BUT THEY'D BE -- ASSIGNED TO A THAT'S OUR I THINK ALL OF WHAT'S INCLUDED AND OUR REQUEST FOR CITIES CITY TWO CREW ADDITIONAL FIRE PROTECTION AND PREVENTION WORK. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. RIGHT WHEN WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PART SEVERAL CALL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO GREAT TABLE. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. OUR DEPARTMENTS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS SPECIFIC. AND FOR A VERY DEFINED PURPOSE. OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO MEET OUR ROLE IN THE BROADER EFFORT THAT IS CREATED THROUGH SENATE BILL NINE A ONE I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE FOR THE RECORD. THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES IDENTIFIED IN THE STAFF AGENDA AND MENTION BY THE CHIEF. AFFECTED OUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL. THEY THREATENED OUR FACILITIES IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SOMETIMES WILDLIFE AREAS AN ECOLOGICAL RESERVES. I MADE PHONE CALLS TO STAFF WHO'VE LOST PROPERTY. AND HOMES -- OVER THE COURSE OF THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THEY'VE IMPACTED FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND OFTEN SOME OF OUR STAFF WHO LOST HOME AND PROPERTIES WERE THEMSELVES FIRST RESPONDERS. AS OUR WARDENS ASSIGNED TO THE CHIEF. TO HELP EXPAND HIS FORCE IN THE STAR MOMENTS. THE PURPOSE -- IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND PROPOSALS SPECIFIC. WE SICK FIFTEEN POSITIONS. AND A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. OF WHICH ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND IS GENERAL FUND. AND TWO MILLION IS FROM THE TIMBER REGULATION AND FOREST RESTORATION FUND WHICH I'LL MENTION AT THE END OF MY REMARKS. THIS IS ONE OF THE SMALLER AMOUNTS REQUESTED COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER INDIVIDUAL -- PROPOSALS IN THE GLOBAL PACKAGE. THE PURPOSE -- IS VERY DEFINED. WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. SENATE BILL NINE A ONE REQUIRES OUR DEPARTMENT TO REVIEW NOTICES OF EXEMPTION. SENATE BILL NINE A ONE INCREASE CREATES NEW POSSIBLE EXEMPTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS -- WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO ASSESS IMPACTS THE SPECIES ARE NATURAL RESOURCES WERE REQUIRED TO HELP CAL FIRE IN COMPLIANCE MONITORING. AND REPORTING POST INSPECTIONS. WE HAVE OUR OWN PERMITTING RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO THESE -- EXEMPTIONS THAT WILL NEED TO BE EXPEDITED. AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN ADVISORY ROLE. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION HAS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED ITS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO SENATE BILL NINE A ONE AND THOSE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS RELY HEAVILY ON OUR DEPARTMENT FOR POST PROJECT MONITORING. AND PRE PROJECT CONSULTATION. NONE OF WHICH HAS FUNDING SHORT OF THE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF YOU. SO LET ME TURN IN CONCLUSION TO SOME ITEMS YOU MAY HEAR IN PUBLIC COMMENT AND THAT COME UP IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGE. FOURTEEN THE TIMBER REGULATION FORCE RESTORATION FUND IS MANAGED. BY THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY NOT THE DEPARTMENT. I DON'T READ THE STAFF AGENDA TO SAY IT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE FUNDS SOURCE. I READ THE STAFF AGENDA TO QUESTION THE FUND BALANCE STATUS OVER TIME. SO I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND RESOURCE AGENCY -- ARE THE KIND OF BEST POSITION TO ANSWER THAT I WILL TELL YOU. THAT THAT FUND -- COVERS OUR WORK AROUND TIONS. AND CREATE STATUTORY PROHIBITIONS WE'RE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CHARGE FEES FOR THAT TYPE OF WORK. IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ABILITY TO CHARGE FEES. WE'RE LOOKING AT GENERAL FUND AND THIS FUND TO SUPPORT THE WORK WE NEED TO DO WONDER SENATE BILL NINE A ONE I'LL STOP THERE AND SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU I I THINK YOU -- FOR TOUCH TO IN YOUR A CLOSING COMMENTS THERE ON THE ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO INQUIRE ON BUT I PROBABLY BASED ON YOUR COMMENTS SHOULD INQUIRE OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- RATHER THAN YOURSELF -- DIRECTOR BOTTOM -- SO -- THERE'S THE THIS -- A TIMBER REGULATION ENFORCED GROW -- DIVERTING TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO PERFORM TIMBER HARVESTS. PLAN EXEMPTION REVIEWS -- THE OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THAT IS TRENDING IN A WAY THAT -- THE EXPENDITURES THE FUND IS -- TRENDING IN A WAY THAT EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO BE GREATER THAN REVENUES SO. ON HOW CAN WE SUPPORT DECIDED ON WHAT BASIS. YES SIR DRAG OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO JUST START OFF THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS FORD PART OF FISH WILDLIFE ARE FOR FIVE YEARS SO THEY'RE NOT ONGOING BASIS TO THE CLERK BY THAT POINT. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DO THIS TOMB -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR AND BALANCE IN THE FUND TO ABOUT ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND CURRENT LAW THE TH THAT WISH -- MINIMUM RESERVE BALANCE OF FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT MUST BE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THAT FIND. IN CASE THERE'S DROPS IN REVENUE FOR WITH BUDGET OF INCLUDED FOR FUNDING FOR CHRISTIAN WILDLIFE IN THE THE FUND BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHER OFFSETS ANTHEM DECREASES IN EXPENDITURES IN THE FIND. ASSOCIATED WITH THEM LIMIT TERM RESOURCES ARE DROPPING OFF SO ACTUALLY IN NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S LEFT EXPENDITURES THAN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO IT'S ACTUALLY DECREASING AND TOTALED VENTURES AND THE FUND -- THERE IS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE LEVEL OF AUTHORITY IS BIRTH IS THE REVENUE COMING IN HOWEVER THAT STRUCK COMPELLED TO THE BAY OVERSTATED BECAUSE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS? THERE'S BEEN APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL SAVINGS CORRECTLY IT IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE ABOUT COMING IN. AND WE HAVE SEEN A PRETTY CONSISTENT INCREASE IN REVENUE AND ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY INCREASE IN REVENUE. SO THIS SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR -- AND HE VALLEY ON ANNUAL BASIS AT THIS POINT -- YOU KNOW THE FUND IT DOES HAVE ABOVE THE MINIMUM RESERVE LEVEL AND WE DO THINK IT COULD SUSTAIN THIS UP FIVE YEAR COST BUT WALKING THROUGH THE VALLEY TO FIND. TAKES THAT IN THREE FOUR YEARS WE SEE YOU KNOW GREATER ISSUE THEN WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER ALTERNATIVES EITHER BRING DOWN THE COST OR SEE WHAT OTHER OTHER THINK WE COULD DO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. SO I TRIED TO FOLLOW MOST OF THAT -- THAT WAS A LOT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT YOUR CONCLUSION AS THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME THE FUND WILL NOT GO NEGATIVE -- IS THAT YOUR CONCLUSION ALSO FOR A LONGER TERM. IF THE TREND CONTINUE AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING ORDER THE FIVE YEAR PRAYED -- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO BE A GOOD SUSTAIN IT -- IN THE LONG RUN AT THE GOING TO CONTINUE VALLEY ANY MONITORING -- YOU KNOW IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE REVENUE THE REVENUE KEEP ON CLIMBING AS THEY HAVE BEEN THAT WE SHOULD BE FINE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S A PROTECTIVE ORDER THAT -- SAY YOU KNOW IN SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS WHAT WOULD BE THE REVENUE BUT AT LEAST FOR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD IF THE TREND CONTINUE AS WE ARE WITH. THE ACTUAL LEVEL EXPENDITURE THE REVENUES COMING IN THEN IT IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAY IN IT ALL RIGHT WELL -- THANK YOU -- AGAIN WE'RE HOLDING THIS OPEN AT ALL ASK YOU TO HUDDLE WITH -- OUR STAFF TO GO OVER THOSE OF PROJECTIONS THANK YOU MISTER FONG. I THINK IT WAS GERMAN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- ALL ALL BUT A JUMP AROUND BUT FOR AND IN TERMS OF THE B. C. B. I KNOW THE SB NINE A ONE REQUIRES -- OFFICIAL WILDLIFE TO TO REVIEW THE NOSE OF EXEMPTIONS BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- THE ROLE THE EXAMS AS OUR MINISTERIAL SO THAT THEY REQUIRE YOUR DEPARTMENTS APPROVAL SO HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THE FACT THAT THERE'S THE NEED FOR MORE STAFF WHEN. IN ESSENCE CAL FIRE MAKES THOSE DETERMINATIONS NOT FISH WILDLIFE. HEY MY EXPERIENCE CAL FIRE IN OUR DEPARTMENT HAVE A CLOSE AND PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP THAT ALLOWS US TO MEET MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES. ONE OF THOSE STATE OBJECTIVES IS PROTECTING PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES. I HEAR YOUR COMMENT AND EXCEPT THE VIEW ABOUT THE MINISTERIAL ASPECT [inaudible] BUT SB NINE OH ONE CREATES A BROAD PUBLIC POLICY ENDEAVOR -- TO DO THINGS BETTER AND FASTER GIVEN THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE. OUR DEPARTMENT PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS THE STATE'S PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCE. AGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO STREAM CROSSINGS BECOMES A TEMPORARY ROAD CONSTRUCTION. AND I THINK OUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE WELL IN THE REGIME CREATED BY NINE A ONE IS SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. SO THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THAT IN TERMS OF INSERTING ANOTHER DEPARTMENT INTO SOMETHING WHERE IT CAL FIRE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE AND THEN DISTRIBUTE THE EXEMPTIONS THAT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THINGS FASTER. HE WOULD YOU GIVE US SOME ASSURANCE THAT THESE THINGS WOULD PROCEED FASTER AS MR PASS INDICATED WILDFIRE PREVENTION IS YOU SHOULD BE OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. YES I CAN GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. FOR SURE IT'S I'LL GIVE YOU BOTH. LET ME GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE FIRST. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I BELIEVE [inaudible] CALIFORNIE FIVE POSITIONS TO FOCUSED ON POST EXEMPTION MONITORING. FUNDED FROM THE TIMBER FUND. YOU'LL SEE IN OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL A SPECIFIC INTERESTING INCREASING OUR CAPACITY. FOR POST EXEMPTION MONITORING IN FACT. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTIONS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS PURSUANT. TO NINE ONE RELY ON OUR DEPARTMENT HEAVILY TO HELP CAR FIRE DO THE POST PROJECT MONITORING. AND PRE PROJECT CONSULTATION GIVEN OTHER EXAMPLE ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF NINE OH ONE THAT I SEE. IS THE ABILITY FOR SMALL TIMBER OWNERS TO COME IN TO THE CONSULTATION PROCESS AND BE ABLE TO THEN GO OUT. AND SEND THEIR FOREST ON SMALL TIMBER PROPERTIES -- WHICH IS A DIFFERENT -- OF INVESTMENT FOR SMALL TIMBER UNDERSTAND LARGER INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES. THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT HINGES ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSULT WITH THEM AND ADVISE THEM. SO I THINK THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF IMPROVING THE PROCESS. EXPEDITING THE PROCESS WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN MORE TEMPERATE DEMINING DONE IN THE STATE TO PREVENT FIRES HERE'S THE INSURANCE. AS DIRECTOR -- I WILL PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. TO HOW WE USE THESE FIFTH FIFTEEN POSITIONS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK US TO COME BACK WITH PERFORMANCE METRICS. TO SHOW YOU THE INVESTMENT HAS PRODUCED THINGS FASTER THAN I WOULD BE WILLING TO STAND BY THOSE PERFORMANCE MUCH OKAY AWESOME I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND JUST FOR EXAMPLE I'LL OF SAY THAT YOU'VE YOU'RE REQUESTING A POSITION IN THE SOUTH COAST REGION. AND THE INLAND REGION I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT AND IN THOSE AREAS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S PROBABLY BEEN ONE OR TWO PLANS UNDER REVIEW. SO DO YOU EXPECT. AND AT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THOSE AREAS VERSE BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING FOR POSITIONS IN AREAS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF WORK RIGHT NOW. ONE SECOND BECAUSE OF LIKE TO LOOK AT THE AGENDA. FROM THE STAFF BUT OUR SOUTH BECAUSE REGION. AS WE DEFINED AS THE DEPARTMENT. WOOD OR INCLUDES THE WALLS THE FIRE VENTURA. THE THOMAS FARM IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS AND MALIBU IN SANTA MONICA -- ADVENTURE COUNTY IS EXCELLENT. IN THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH IS VENTURE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY -- CATASTROPHIC FIRES HAPPEN IN OUR SOUTH BECAUSE REGION WE WANT TO BE PREPARED DIVERSE RESPOND ANY REQUESTS FOR EXCEPTIONS EXEMPTIONS AND GET THAT WORKED ON OR IS THAT SOUTH BECAUSE IN INLAND REGION -- FOR US. ARE INLAND REGION -- RUNS INTO RIVERSIDE COUNTY SAN MEDINA COUNTY -- WE AGAIN WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY REQUEST FOR EXCEPTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS TO GET THIS WORK DONE. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT BUMP UP. TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES AND FORESTED LAND. OKAY WEBER AT THE END THE DAY THE END OR NOT A WINE CAL FIRE MAKES A DECISION. WITH THE WITH THE MINISTERIAL AT THIRTY THEY HAVE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE HELPING CALL. FOR OKAY -- IN TERMS OF THE BROADER ACCOUNT -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A I SEE ONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HAVE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ONE I GUESS FROM THE AS THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. I WILL ASK THE RESOURCES AGENCY AND WE WILL EXPEDITE THAT REPORT TO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE OKAY AND THEN TWENTY NINETEEN M. SWIMMING IS BEING WORKED ON MY UNDERSTANDING I WILL CHECK AND GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE. IN TERMS OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT -- I GUESS I'M WE'RE SEEING A DISTURBING TREND ADDING FROM OTHER THAT THAT'S PROBABLY SIMILAR TO OTHER AGENCIES WHICH IS STAFFING INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PLANS APPROVAL PROCESS TIME -- OR PLANS BEING -- PLANS DIG DECREASING THE NUMBER OF YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW IT THE NUMBER OF PLANS DO -- THE THE TIME THE TIME LINE TO PROVE THESE PLANS ARE INCREASING AS WELL SO. MY CONCERN IS THAT YOUR INCREASING STAFF. BUT THEN THE TIME TO REVIEW HIS WHICH IS IS OFFICE OF A LONGER. THE HOPE IS OF COURSE IF YOU HIRE MORE STAFF THAT YOU WOULD MAKE THINGS FASTER SO -- CAN YOU CAN YOU RECONCILE THAT YES. I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THE SAME DATA YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE COMPANIES -- THE COMPRISE THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION THEIR LEADERSHIP. BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS TO ME WE'RE SEEING THE SAME TREND LINES. I THINK WOULD BE VERY CONSTRUCTIVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA. WELL THE OTHER RECONCILIATION I WOULD MAKE IS. SOME OF THE WORK YOU REFERENCE IS WORK THAT IS PRE NINE OH ONE WORK IT WILL NEED TO CONTINUE. FOR TODAY WE'RE FOCUSED ON A REQUEST ABOUT HAVING CAPACITYTO DO THE NINE OH ONE WORK WELL. RIGHT THE NIGHT WHEN WORK IS IS BEING ADDED ON AND SO THAT'S I GUESS LET ME CLARIFY IT IN TERMS OF STAFFING CONTINUES TO GO UP NOT A ONE OBVIOUSLY ADDS MORE WORK. YEAH THE NUMBER OF T. H. P.'S APPROVED WENT DOWN THE NUMBER OF ACRES BEING TREATED WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART HAS GONE DOWN AND THE TIME IT TOOK TO REVIEW THEM WENT UP. SO THOSE THOSE TRENDS ARE POSITIVE [inaudible] CORRECT. I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE SAME DATA YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND I WILL WELCOME AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. THIS MAKE SURE WE'RE SEEING THE TREND LINES THE SAME BUT THE INVESTMENT STAFF SHOULD BE PRODUCING FASTER WORK PRODUCT. AND DESIRED OUTCOMES SOONER. OKAY AND THEN IN TERMS OF YOUR VIEW AND MAYBE THE PART FINANCE YOU CAN JUMP IN HERE I HEAR THE WORDS -- STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IS THE FIND GOING INSOLVENT. SO AT THIS POINT OVER THIS NEXT FIVE YEAR PERIOD -- THAT WE KIND OF LOOK AT AND THE PRIZE THEN ADD THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCE THE REQUESTING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE ARE OVER THIS FIVE YEAR PERIOD. IF THE TRENDS CONTINUE AS THEY HAVE BEEN WITH THE KIND OF LEVEL OF EXPOSURE COMING IN AND THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE INCREASING EACH YEAR WE SHOULD BE FINE BUT IN THE LONG RUN YOU KNOW SEVEN EIGHT TEN HEY -- IT REALLY DOES DEPEND ON THE THE LEVEL OF REVENUE THAT CONTINUE COMING IN AS A NEW LEVEL EXPAND OR SO IF SOMETHING EVER DEFTLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE MONITORING AND EVALUATING -- BUT AT THIS POINT FOR NEXT TWO YEARS WE FEEL THAT THE FUND COULD SUSTAIN THESE COSTS. AND WE'RE DEFINITELY ABOVE THAT MADE THEM -- THRESHOLD IN STATUE WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AT ALL TIMES IN THE FIND OUR CURRENTLY AT ELEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE THE THE STAFF THE STAFF -- A STAFF ANALYSIS MADE EXPENDITURES ARE EXCEEDING REVENUES PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE MAIN THAT'S IT THAT'S CORRECT. THE DECLARE BY THE THE AUTHORIZED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES ARE ABOVE THE ANNUAL REVENUE HOWEVER WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE ACTUAL LEVEL BECAUSE THERE'S AN AUTHORIZED AMOUNT AND THEN AFTER THE YEAR AND WE DO ACTUAL. THEY'RE ACTUALLY COOK A COMING IN -- PRETTY CONSISTENT AS THOUGH WHEN HE JUST THAT'S WHY IT IN MY EARLIER COMMENT. I MENTIONED THAT THE STRUCTURE BALLOT MAY BE OVERSTATED WHEN YOU JUST LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF AUTHORITY VERSUS LEVEL OF REVENUE BECAUSE IN OUR KIND OF PREVIOUS AND HEALTH OF THE PAST FEW YEARS. THE ACTUAL HAVEN'T BEEN COMING AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROJECTING THEM TOO SO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT. AS MUCH OUT OF THE SPECTRUM BALANCED AS YOU WOULD SEE IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE FINE CONDITION BALANCE OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN F. N. AND THEN IT'S GONE TO ELEVEN BILLION IN -- TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT'S YOU KNOW A REDUCTION OF NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS. SO IN HONOR THAT PATH. THAT WOULD BE UNSUSTAINABLE CORRECT. I'M OUT ALL THOSE NUMBERS INCORRECT. THAT IN IN A IN A TWO YEAR PERIOD WE'VE GONE DOWN NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS. I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHAT WITH SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED IN THE AGENDA WE COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR YOU HAVE COULD SEE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHICH LOOK AT THE ACTUAL TRAINS COMING IN SO. WE COULD DEFINITELY PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE STAFF AT THE SHARE WITH YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND AT THE END OF MY MY FINAL ON I GUESS. MY FOR A SURE WINNER I GUESS FOCUS ON IS THAT THE AND WE WOULD AGREE THAT WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS GOING INTO GRANTS AND TREATMENT OF ACRES NOT STAFF [inaudible] CORRECT [inaudible] SO. AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO IDENTIFIED A LEVEL OF PRIORITIES FOR THE FIND AND THAT'S CURRENTLY IN STATUTE. AND THE PRIORITIES IS FIRST FOR THE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPARTMENTS TO DO THE REVIEW AND PERMITTING PROCESS FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WITH A TIMBER OPERATIONS SO THAT'S THE FIRST LEVEL PRIORITY IN STATUTE. THE STATUE THAT IDENTIFIES AFTER THAT FIRST LEVEL PRIORITY IS MET. IF THERE'S FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FUND THEN WE CAN USE THAT FOR GRANTS SO THERE IS THERE ARE -- FUNDING FOR GRANT'S WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENTS -- HOWEVER THERE IS DEFINITELY LESS BINDING BECAUSE WE ARE FOLLOWING THE STATUE WHICH IDENTIFIES THE PRIORITY LEVEL FOR THE FUNDS. I YEARS WAS A THAT WE WOULD WANT TO FLIP THAT THE PRIORITY RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT. AND MAXIMIZING THE ENVIRONMENT IMPACT IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THESE ACRE MORE ACRES ARE BEING TREATED OF THE GRANTS RIGHT WE WANT MORE MONEY TO GO OUT TO THE GRANT. AND LESS TO THE OVERHEAD CORRECT. I WOULD OR MISS BY WOULD BE TO SEE THAT YOU WANT TO CHIME IN HERE TO WHERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. MORE MONEY GOES OUT TWO TO THREE ACRES AND NOT REALLY MUCH FOR OVERHEAD. WELL I DON'T ACCEPT THE PREMISE THAT THE GRANTING PRODUCES MORE ON THE GROUND RESULTS AND STAFF CAPACITY. NECESSARILY FOR EXAMPLE. OUR DEPARTMENT PROJECTS RECEIVING. AN ONSLAUGHT OF REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS IN EXCEPTIONS. WE EXPECT TO HELP CAL FIRE. IF WE CAN PROCESS THAT WORKLOAD THEN. I THINK THE LOGIC FOLLOWS MORE PEOPLE WILL BE OUT ON THEIR FOREST LANDS DOING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES BLACK BUT WE WANT MORE MONEY TO GO INTO THE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. AND STAFF CAPACITY. CAN PRODUCE THAT RESULT AS WELL OR BETTER THAN GRANT RESTORATION FUNDING. SAY THAT AGAIN SO YOU WOULD SAY THAT. THE THAT STAFFING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GRANT CAPACITY YOUR PREMISES. USING FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE DISCREET. RESTORATION FUNDING CHOICES. WILL PRODUCE MORE LANDSCAPE CHANGE DâN. DEALING WITH THE INCOMING REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS. I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT PREMISE HOLDS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE INCOMING REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS AND EXCEPTIONS THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT. TRYING TO GET BOOTS ON THE GROUND FASTER AND TREATING OUR FOREST ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE. SO I THINK THERE'S A PRUDENT DECISION. TO PREPARE FOR THAT WORKLOAD AND RESPOND TO THAT WORK LOAD. THAT MAY PRODUCE MORE TREATMENT. THEN HE SAID A DISCREET GRANT FUNDING DECISIONS MAY. MAY OKAY I I I I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ALL THE NUMBERS I JUST WHEN YOU SAY FOR MY AND WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR. BALANCE CORRECT SO IF THERE'S ELEVEN I WOULD WANT THAT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO MAKE TO GO OUT TO GRANT OR AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN IT FOR MINOR BALLOTS. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO EAT INTO THE FOUR MILLION DOLLAR -- BALLOTS WE GOTTA MAINTAIN THEN WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING. TO EXACERBATE. THE FUND THAT IS PAID FOR BY FEES SO EITHER YOU SOLVE THIS INSOLVENCY BY. A FEE INCREASE WHICH I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU GUYS REPAIRED TO TO ENTERTAIN ARE OVER I WOULD SUPPORT. SO I I GUESS I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE PRIORITIZE THINGS THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT MORE MONEY GOES OUT TO TREATING AREAS AND PREVENTING WILDFIRES WHICH IS I THINK THE THE THE PRIORITY OF EVERYONE ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND THEN GOING INTO A DELAYED OVERSIGHT -- WHICH WOULD IS PROBABLY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S MINISTERIAL THAT'S I APPRECIATE THE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS. MISTER PATTERSON. I JUST QUIT THE FOCUS A BIT ON THAT. ACCORDING TO OUR REVIEW OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT FOR THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS. THAT THIS PROCESS OF STAFF GETTING OUT IN GETTING STUFF DONE OUT THERE WITH BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THAT THAT PLAN REVIEWS THIS IS A TWENTY SEVENTEEN DECREASED. THE NUMBER OF ACRES REVIEWED DECREASED. FULL TIME STAFF WORKING ON THESE PLANS HAS INCREASED. YET THE AVERAGE TIME OF REVIEW FOR THE PLANS [inaudible] HAS INCREASED. THAT'S TWENTY SEVENTEEN DO YOU. SUGGEST THAT YOUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT. WHAT HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT SET OF? THINGS GOING UP AND THINGS GOING DOWN. I HAVE MADE NO SUGGESTION ABOUT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT I UNDERSTAND. THAT PERSPECTIVE RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT. I'VE SAID WITH REGARD TO THOSE NUMBERS. I'D LIKE TO SIT WITH YOU AND THE TIMBER ASSOCIATION MAKE SURE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA. I TO SHARE AN INTEREST AND ALL THE TREND LINES GOING UP IN PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY. BUT THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RESPECTIVELY OUR PROPOSAL TODAY. WHICH IS ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE S. B. NINE NO ONE RESPONSIBILITIES. SO WE'RE HELPING CAUGHT FIRE WE'RE HELPING INDUSTRY AND WE'RE DOING MORE PREVENTION NOT LESS. AT THIS IS A RECURRING. THEME WITH MAY. WHETHER IT'S ON THIS -- COMMITTEE OR OTHERS INCLUDING J. LACK. WE SEE REPEATEDLY. REQUESTS FOR MORE STAFF. BIGGER BUDGETS. AND WHEN WE SEE HOW OTHER DEPARTMENTS. USE THOSE FUNDS AT ALL OF THE UP ARCS OF PROGRESS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE GO THE OTHER WAY. I CONTEND THIS IS ENDEMIC. TO BUREAUCRACIES AD I GUESS MY TAKE AWAY HERE IS. I AM AT LEAST PLEASE THAT YOU SEE THAT THOSE TREND LINES. AS SERIOUS AND I WOULD TRUST AND HOPE THAT THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS DEPARTMENT -- WILL PRODUCE IN REPORTS FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN WHAT WE WANT TO DO. YOU'RE ASKING FOR US TO APPROVE. AND WHEN WE DO. RARELY DO WE SEE. A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE PROBLEM THAT WAS -- PARAMOUNT AND WAS THE REASON FOR THE INCREASED BUDGET. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OF MISTER BONHAM THANK YOU. MISS YOU IT WHO SEVERAL I HAVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD COMING PRESENT THEIR PROPOSAL THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS EILEEN SO BACK I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD -- THANK YOU -- FOR GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO PRESENTER PROPOSAL TODAY -- WE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD REQUEST TWENTY TWO POSITIONS AND FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN THROUGH -- TWENTY WE OF COURSE SUPPORT OUR HE'S AND A MISSION -- TO AS SET OUT IN IN SB NINE NO ONE AND WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE BE ABLE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT -- THAT ALL OF THE FIRE UP. HELP PROTECTION -- AND AND FOREST RESILIENCY ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED BUT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY THAT DOESN'T HAVE UNINTENDED ADVERSE -- CONSEQUENCES TO OTHER POP -- IMPORTANT PUBLIC RESOURCES. SO SINCE -- THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED AND REQUIRED -- UNDER SB NINE NO ONE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE LAND MANAGEMENT AND DISTURBANCE -- ACTIVITIES. THERE ARE. IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW MUCH BUT THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. TO WATER QUALITY ACROSS THE STATE'S THIRTY THREE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND. AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND MILES OF UTILITY CORNER COURT CORRIDORS. SO THESE GROUND DISTURBING ACTIVITIES -- WILL -- WILL OCCUR IN SOME OF THE STATE'S MOST IMPORTANT AND PRODUCTIVE SOURCE WATERSHEDS. AND THE WORK CONDUCTED HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE SETTLEMENT AND PESTICIDE DISCHARGES INTO WATERS OF THE STATE. TO ALTER FOREST AND STREAM CHANNEL HYDROLOGY -- POTENTIALLY INCREASING AND CONCENTRATING -- STORM WATER RUNOFF RESULTING IN EROSION -- AND SEDIMENT DISTRICT JUSTICE TO STREAMS POSSIBLE RISK TO DOWNSTREAM INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDE INCLUDING ROADS AND WATER SOURCE CROSSINGS -- AND DESTRUCTION CHEMICALS IN THE FORM OF PETROLEUM AND PESTICIDE PRODUCTS USED ADJACENT TO OUR UP SLOPE OF THE SURFACE WATERS. SO SUCH DISCHARGES -- DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT BENEFICIAL USES OF THE STATE'S WATER -- FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING SEDIMENTATION CAN DIRECTLY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF QUITE XP SEES. AN AQUATIC HABITATS -- INCREASE -- INCREASING WATER TEMPERATURES CAN CREATE HUMAN HEALTH HAZARDS INCLUDING -- THOSE FROM HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CLEAN DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES CAN BE -- THREATENED OR COMPROMISE THROUGH INCREASED SETTLEMENT AND INTRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS -- UP BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITIES AUTHORIZED UNDER -- SB NINE A ONE THE WATER BOARD WILL NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW STATEWIDE GENERAL ORDER -- FOR OF WASTE JUST TRY TO REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF UTILITY CORPS OF CORRIDORS AND ASSOCIATED ACCESS ROADS. AND WE WILL HAVE TO ESTABLISH A SYSTEM FOR CONDUCTING FIELD INSPECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY QUARTERS AND MAINTENANCE. AND THEN WE'LL HAVE TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FIELDS INSPECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TIMBER HARVEST -- THE TIMBER HARVEST AN EXEMPTION -- BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE TEMPORARY ROAD BUILDING AND WITH NO PRE APPROVAL -- SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED -- TO AM RATIONAL INSPECTION SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE POTENTIAL -- HARMS TO WATER SOURCES THAT I MENTIONED -- DO NOT OCCUR A MOST OF THE POSITIONS THAT WERE ASKING FOR THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE -- WOULD BE -- SEARCHED OUT TWO OF THE REGIONAL WATER PORTS WHERE THE INSPECTIONS -- OCCUR THERE FOR MEAN FOR REGIONAL WATER PORTS IN WHICH TIMBERLANDS OCCUR SO THAT'S WHERE -- WE WOULD DEPLOY THE INSPECTION RESOURCES -- THERE ARE A FEW POSITIONS WHICH WOULD BE AT THE STATE WATER BOARD TO DEAL WITH THE THE UTILITIES AND THE THE GENERAL PERMIT. TO WORK. THERE TWO SOURCES FOR THE FUNDING THAT WERE -- REQUESTING -- THE UTILITY RELATED WORK -- WILL BE FEATURED RATED UNDER THE BOARDS WASTE DISTRICT PERMIT FUND -- BUT AS MENTIONED BY DIRECTOR BONHAM -- THE THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDS -- WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS BEING APPROPRIATELY FROM THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS UNDER A. B. FOURTEEN NINETY TWO REGARDING -- PROVISIONS ON ON A CHARGING FEES -- FOR ACTIVITIES AND TIMBER -- LANDS SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU QUESTIONS. HI I DON'T SEE ANY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND TO PROCESS OF ELIMINATION OF BUT YOU'RE GONNA ASK CARE BE A STEP FORWARD. THANKS YOU'RE OFFICIALLY APPOINTED. TO SEVERAL HAVE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS BUT THE CALLER. WELCOME WELL AT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN WOMEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE EIGHT MY NAME IS ET CHIANG A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. I'M SO THE PRESS BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING IS PURSUANT TO SB TWELVE SIXTY AND IT WILL HELP BUT CARP IMPLEMENT AT BETTER SMOKE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR PRESCRIBED FIRES. INCLUDING AIR MONITORING AND INCREASE PUBLIC OUTREACH WE'RE REQUESTING FUNDING OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN ONGOING FUNDING OF TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS. ON AIR DISTRICTS ARE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY MAKE THE ON THE GROUND DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH BURNS ARE AUTHORIZED TO THIS REQUEST INCLUDES TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS TO FULLY ENGAGE AND BOTH THE AIR MONITORING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE APPROVAL PROCESS. ON THIS REQUEST IS BUILT ON A PILOT PROGRAM THAT CARP THE AIR DISTRICTS AND CAL FIRE WORKED ON OVER THE LAST YEAR. THIS PROGRAM MONITORED SMOKE FROM PURSE FOR ACTUALLY INCREASE THE DAYS AN ACREAGE IS A PRESCRIBED FIRES WHILE MINIMIZING IMPACTS TO PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS PILOT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND THESE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL SUPPORT AIR MONITORING FOR MORE PRESCRIBED FIRES HELPING US INCREASE STAYS IN ANCHORAGES. IT WILL ALSO HELP US INFORM DOWN WHEN COMMUNITIES ABOUT POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS AND DEVELOP MORE ACCURATE SMOKE MODELING. ON THIS IMPROVE SMOKE MODELING HELPS US REFINE THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE IN AN ONLINE TOOL CALLED P. FURS. AND WHAT THIS TOOL DOES IS IT HELP STREAMLINE THE PRESCRIBED FIRE APPROVAL AND REPORTING PROCESS. I'M FINALLY THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WILL ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORTS AND TO COORDINATE COMMON PUBLIC MESSAGING WITH OTHER AGENCIES. ALSO DEALING WITH SMOKE MANAGEMENT SO THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SB NINE OH ONE REQUIREMENTS -- AT THAT ARE THAT WE CAN GET A B. C. P. -- FOR THE X.. THAT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE THE CONFINED THAT GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS OF FORCE THAN AND AND ESTABLISHING A BASELINE OF HISTORIC FIRE MISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT. GOOD MORNING Là VERY DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M WE BELIEVE THAT AIRPORT HAS ROBUST EMISSIONS BY TRACKING QUANTIFICATION SYSTEMS ALREADY IN PLACE SO WE DID NOT PUT FORWARD A REQUEST. FOR SB NINE A ONE AND EMISSIONS BASELINE ESTABLISHMENT SO THAT FUNCTION THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE OBSERVABLE WITH AND CURRENT FUNDING. GREAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. DID YOU WANT ADDED DID YOU. DID YOU WANT TO ADD A COMMENT. SELECT DELL COMPUTERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I'M NOT SPECIFICALLY ON THE AIR BE PROPOSAL BUT BROADLY ACROSS ALL OF THE PROPOSALS TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. I AM OUR REVIEW NOTES THAT THE PROPOSAL'S ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IS REQUIRED IN THE LEGISLATION AND WERE SEEN WORKLOAD INCREASES THE STAFFING INCREASES SEEMED A REASONABLE AND AND AND GENERALLY APPROPRIATE. AND BUT THIS IS ONE AREA THAT WE THINK AND REALLY IT MERITS A LOT AS ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION AND LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT -- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS HERE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASKED AND BY THE COMMITTEE ALREADY BUT? AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE GAVE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION TO THE MINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. WHAT LEGISLATION IS NEVER SUPER JUST WINE AND TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE THE THE WAY THAT THESE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS REALLY CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES? I'M AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND SOME OF THEM ARE ARE OUTLINED IN EITHER A GENDO THERE'S A COUPLE THAT HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED ON YET SO JUST HIGHLIGHT THOSE FOR YOU. AND RELATED TO CAL FIRE THE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT THE TURNER MILLION DOLLARS WAS TOUCHED ON SOMEONE AND WITH RESPECT TO THE GRANTS AND THERE'S ALSO THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A DEDICATED PRESCRIBED BURN CREW IS -- THAT'S A NEW FUNCTION IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S IN THE PROCESS I'VE IN THE CURRENT YEAR HIRING AND STAFFING AT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT WHERE THESE CREWS ARE GONNA BE LOCATED WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IN. HIRING STAFF AND GETTING THEM TRAINED ON AND HOW AND HOW FAIRS GOING TO PRIORITIZE THAT WORKLOAD A WEIRD IT DIDN'T DEPLOY THESE CREWS. AND AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO INTERACT AND IN A IN A WAY THAT IT'S AND COMPLEMENTARY TO THE GRANTS AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT AND THAT CALAVERAS DOING. M. AND SO WE THINK THERE'S JUST MORE INFORMATION THAT YOU MIGHT WANT THEIR ABOUT AND WHERE WHERE THEY'RE AT IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THEN AS THEY EXPAND TO THE CRUISE WHAT LESSONS HAVE THEY LEARNED FROM THE PROCESS OF HIRING UP THE INITIAL SIX CREWS. HOW IS THAT GOING TO CHANGE THINGS AS THEY EXPAND TO TEN PRESCRIBED BURN CREWS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO ENSURE THAT THESE CREWS ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON PRESCRIBED BURN WORK AND NOT GETTING PULLED TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT? AND THE OTHER PIECE THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN TOUCHED ON YET -- RELATIVE TO THESE THESE BUDGET PROPOSALS. IS I'M SB NINE A ONE REQUIRES CAL FIRE TO DEVELOP THE WIRE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO LANDOWNERS TO HELP THEM. SORT OF NAVIGATE THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND THERE'S SOME FUNDING AND PROPOSED. IN IN THE BUDGET RELATED TO THIS WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROGRAM AND YOU MIGHT WANT MORE INFORMATION ON WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT SIZE FOR THAT PROGRAM HOW MANY LANDOWNERS THEY EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO HELP. WITH THE FUNDING AND STAFFING THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED AND JUST ENSURE THAT THAT REALLY ALIGNS WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE -- INTENDED WHEN WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED REQUIRING THEM TO CREATE THIS PROGRAM. WE THINK THERE'S ALSO AN NUMBER AS I'M OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS FOR THE LONGER TERM BEYOND JUST WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THAT. REALLY THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE FOR IMPROVING FOREST HEALTH AND AND PREVENTING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AND IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT OVER THE LONGER TERM AND SO. MAKING SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS COLLECTING DATA IN A WAY AND MEASURING OUTCOMES IN A WAY THAT REALLY GETS THE LEGISLATURE THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING SUCCESSFUL AND MEETING THEIR GOALS. AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS RELATED TO AND HOW FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED TO THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AREAS ASSEMBLY WOMAN RAY AS YOU KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS ALREADY WITH THAT. HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION AND AND YOU CHAIR -- WHAT ARE THE LESSONS BEING LEARNED AND AND HOW IS CAL FIRE? REALLY ENSURING THAT IT'S IT'S NOT JUST GRANTING OUT FUNDS TO THE HIGHEST POVERTY PROJECTS TO GETS APPLICATIONS FOR BUT IS IT BEING PROACTIVE IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING. THE AREAS OF THE GREATEST NEED -- ON THIS TOPIC I WOULD KNOW YOUR STAFF AGENDA ALSO -- POINTS OUT THE COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE PREVENTION MITIGATION REPORT THAT WAS JUST RELEASED BY THE ADMINISTRATION THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO IS THE FORTY FIVE DAY PLAN -- AND THAT SETS OUT SOME PRIORITIES -- OF FOR WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE IN THE IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM AND THE NEAR TERM. TO REDUCE FUELS AND PROTECT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AT RISK AND YOUR STAFF AGENDA IT PROPERLY SORT OF ASK THE QUESTION OF WHAT HOW IS THIS GOING TO BE FUNDED IS THIS COMING OUT OF EXISTING FINDS HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO THE MONEY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED -- FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND THAT THE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF GOOD OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS AND AND WE WE LAY OUT IN OUR OUR REVIEW OF THE BUDGET PROPOSALS ADDITIONAL ON GOING OVERSIGHT% QUESTIONS. BARRIERS TO IMPLEMENTING IS THE APPROPRIATE WORK FORCE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE. TO AND THAT THAT YOU KNOW I FOR WERE WERE MAKING HEALTH WORKERS FEELS REDUCTION ARE THEY STRUGGLING TO HIRE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK -- AND SO ARE THEIR VERY YEARS WORK FORCE CARRIERS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT AND SO WE LAY OUT A LIST OF QUESTIONS WE DO THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE FOR BOTH. THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AS WELL AS ON GOING THAT THIS IS AN AREA THAT -- WOULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE -- A REPORT YES IF YOU WANT TO ADD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOMERS JULIANNA MOORE IS A ME WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO ADD A NOTE. AS FAR AS A ARBY'S FUNDING TO TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT CURRENT YEAR. THEY DO THEY DID RECEIVE -- THROUGH AN AGREEMENT WITH CAL FIRE FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION. TO BEGIN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INCREASE PRESCRIBED FIRE BURNING -- AND I SAW THE GRAND FOR P.. FOR I WOULD SAY YES FOR THE THANK YOU I WAS PRESCRIBED. MYERS WHAT. IN A IN A IN A TOWN THAT'S A FILLED WITH ACRONYMS I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN YEAH. THAT THAT MEANS PRESCRIBED FIRE INFORMATION REPORTING SYSTEM SO. IN THE PAST IT IT'S BEEN AVAILABLE. BUT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND NOT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN NOT ALL OF THE LOCALS. HAVE BEEN USING IT. BUT SINCE THE FOCUS. IS MORE ON THE WILD FIRES AND PREVENTION. I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE WHICH YOU. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE -- INTENT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. AND FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. IS STRENGTHENING. SO THEY DO HAVE RESOURCES TO PERFORM SOME OF THE WORK THAT SB NINE A ONE IS IS LAYING OUT. IN THE CURRENT YEAR RESOURCES AS WELL AS SB NINE A ONE BASICALLY FOR A ARBY'S PURPOSES. JUST. MOVED FORWARD WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING CURRENTLY. WOULD YOU. SO THE TICKET TO THE PAPER'S QUESTION I WAS GOING TO SPARE YOU WHAT THE ACRONYM ACTUALLY FRIENDS BECAUSE I HAD TO LOOK UP WHAT IT MEANT I'M WHEN I WAS PREPARING FOR THE TESTIMONY. IT IS IT HOW IT IS A VOLUNTARY SYSTEM BUT IT IS THE WAY THAT WE HELP MANAGE MAKING OF BURN CALLS. UP BOARDS THE FOR BOTH THE FOR SERVICE AND CAL FIRE ARE BOTH USING P. FIRST FOR ALL OF THEIR PRESCRIBED FIRES NOW AND WITH THE COMING INCREASING PRESCRIBED FIRES WERE EXPECTING TO SEE. EVEN MORE ACTIVITY IN THAT SYSTEM SO THERE'S FUNDING IN THIS REQUEST TO HELP SORT OF BOLSTER IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE AGING SYSTEMS -- AND THEN ALSO AS I MENTIONED HAVING SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT SMOKE MODELING HELPS US BE ABLE TO USE P. FIRST MORE AFFECTIVELY SO THE DISTRICTS WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE DATA CAN SEE -- THIS IS THESE BURNS HAVEN'T EVEN HAPPENS THIS IS WHERE WE THINK THE SMOKE WOULD GO AND THAT WILL HELP US WITH OUR PUBLIC OUTREACH AS WELL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE EXPLANATION IS A LITTLE BIT HUMOROUS SO YOU KNOW. PLEASE YOU TO MAYBE NOT TAKE IT AS SERIOUSLY AS SOME OTHERS -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE YOUR ELUCIDATING THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT'S IT'S GOOD THAT -- THAT YOU'RE IN THAT POSITION -- SO AGAIN WE'RE HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN BUT A LOT OF THOSE QUESTIONS MISS PETERS THAT -- AND AND POINTS THAT YOU WERE MAKING ARE THE THINGS THAT -- I THINK OUR STAFF REALLY BECAUSE THIS IS -- UP PRETTY OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND AMOUNT OF AND IN TURN THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE DO -- WE'RE GOING TO NEED THAT ADDITIONAL TIMES STAFF GONNA NEED THAT ADDITIONAL TIME BETWEEN NOW AND OUR NEXT. TO A HEARING AFTER THE MAY REVISED -- THAT TO REVIEW ALL THOSE POINTS SOUND RECOMMENDATION TO US SO WILL BE -- A HEARING THIS ITEM AGAIN BUT WE DO WANT TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM SO WHEN WE MOVED TO THAT RIGHT NOW. OKAY YEAH YEAH AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT AS PEOPLE ARE STEPPING FORWARD WILL -- I WILL ALLOW -- MEMBERS WERE ABSENT FOR VOTES TO CATCH UP. YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION WE'RE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE B. C. P. FOR THE FIFTEEN POSITIONS FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE TWELVE OF WHICH WOULD BE -- USED AT THE TIME A REGULATION ENFORCED RESTORATION FUND JUST TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT THE TIMBER REGULATION ENFORCED RESTORATION FUND. IS A SPECIAL FUND THAT WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB -- FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WHICH THE INDUSTRY SUPPORTED AND IT CREATED A 1% ASSESSMENT ON LUMBER SALES AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE AND THE POINT OF THAT FUND -- OF WHICH TWO MILLION DOLLARS THEY'RE SEEKING TO HAVE FUNDED FOR THE TWELVE POSITIONS. OF THE FIFTEEN IS THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IT ENSURE THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH STAFF AVAILABLE TO DO A THOROUGH AND ACCURATE REVIEW. OF THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS AND PLANS ASSOCIATED WITH TO THAT THOUGH THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES -- UNDER THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO BE RECEIVING THIS INCREASE IN STAFF AND SO AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON. RAISE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT THAT NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY UNDER FOURTEEN NINETY TWO IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT EVERY YEAR BY JANUARY TENTH OF EACH YEAR -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS THE LAST REPORT WE SEEN IN THAT USES FIGURES FROM FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN SO IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE FIFTEEN POSITIONS TWELVE WHICH ARE FUNDED OUT OF THIS FUND. AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES AND A LAST REPORT WE SEEN IS FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN USING FIFTEEN SIXTEEN NUMBERS. IF WE COULD SEE A TREND THAT IS IMPROVING OVER WITH THE REPORT FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH AS THEY POINTED OUT WE SEE AN INCREASE OF OVER TWENTY P. Y. FROM THAT PARTICULAR YEAR. A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SUBMISSIONS OF T. H. PEAS AND ANCHORS TREATED AND YET REVIEW TIME WENT UP ON AVERAGE TWENTY TWENTY DAYS PER ROOM PER TEACH P.. SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE THE EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE THAT WERE. UNDER FOURTEEN NINETY TWO THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE THE EIGHTEEN IN NINETEEN REPORT SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TRENDS ARE BEING CORRECTED -- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SEE AN ORGANIZATION CHART FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING -- ON FOURTEEN NINETY TWO ARE ONLY SINCE IT IS A SPECIAL FUND -- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THAT FUNDS -- THE ON AVERAGE I THINK EVEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WERE PROPOSING TO SPEND -- FIVE OR SIX MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN WE HAVE COMING IN AND REVENUES -- SO IF THAT TREND WILL CONTINUE OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE FOLLOWING YEAR WE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE AT OR BELOW THAT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR MARK. EVEN MORE CONCERNING THEN THAT IS THE FACT THAT MOST OF THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT ON STAFF WHICH IS A LONGER GOING -- PROCESS AND CONTINUING PROCESS. AS OPPOSED TO SPENDING DOWN A RESERVE ON ONE TIME GRANTS -- FINALLY WERE CONCERNED THAT IN THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE B. C. P. IT SAYS THAT SB NINE OH ONE REQUIRES FISH AND WILDLIFE TO REVIEW THESE EXEMPTIONS. AND AS AS WE'VE CLARIFIED TODAY THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE MINISTERIAL THEY DON'T REQUIRE THE REVIEW OR APPROVAL -- IN FACT SB NINE A ONE REQUIRES -- CAL FIRE TO RECEIVE THE MINISTERIAL DOCUMENT THEY IN TURN SEND IT OUT TO THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS -- UNLESS OF A CAL FIRE IS THE ONE THAT DETERMINES IF THE DOCUMENTS ARE ACCURATE AND COMPLETE -- BUT IT IS MINISTERIAL AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THEIR APPROVAL -- IF FISH AND WILDLIFE WAS LOOKING AT INCREASING THE MONITORING -- ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXEMPTIONS I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN AND CONSIDERING HOWEVER. AGAIN -- WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE WE LOOKED AT TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TRY AND GET A BASELINE OF HOW MUCH WORK THESE DEPARTMENTS OF THESE REGIONS ALREADY HAD CONSIDERING THEY WERE LOOKING AT HIRING TO NEW FULL TIME POSITION? TO NEW POSITIONS FOR THIS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BETWEEN THOSE TWO REGIONS THEY HAD A TOTAL OF ONE EXEMPTION. ONE LESS THAN THREE ACRE CONVERSION AND ZERO TIMBER HARVEST PLANTS AND SO FOR US IF THEY WERE LOOKING AT AREAS THE REGIONS THAT HAVE THE MOST -- ACTIVITY IN OUR INDUSTRY AND WANTED TO HIRE ADDITIONAL ONE PERSON FOR EACH OF THOSE REGIONS THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE TO US -- BUT THOSE ARE THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MASON FOR THE OPPOSITE FOR STRESSED WANTED DRYER ATTENTION TO THIS LETTER THAT WE DELIVERED LAST WEEK FROM PACIFIC FOREST TRUST THE NATURE CONSERVANCY DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE CALIFORNIA PLANS TO CITING HALF OF THE DOZEN OTHER NGOS. AND ALL LARGELY BE TRACKING ALONG THOSE SAME ISSUES -- THOSE A VERY DENSE HEARING THIS MORNING A LOT OF INFORMATION I WILL TRY AND SPEAK TO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE SUPPORT BUT RATHER. FLY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK. DESERVE A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION. I WILL NOTE THAT WHERE ARE MY ORGANIZATION FRANKLY ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- BEING APPROPRIATE FOR THE MORE SALT AND FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND TO BE USED IN THE WAY THAT IT WAS USED IN THE PAST I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE MAINTAIN SOME STABILITY AND HOW ARE USING CAN BUILD WORK FORCES AND BUSINESSES THAT ARE ACTUALLY EXECUTING THIS WORKING NOT. WAITING AROUND HERE TO YEAR -- WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE THE CPUS FROM DFW AND THE WATER BOARD TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THE VARIOUS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THAT'S BEEN ON A ONE OR SOMETHING THAT WE ASK. FOR IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. I WILL FLAG I THINK THAT IT'S ALSO IN A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO NOT JUST BE LOOKING AT THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROPOSED ARE HAPPENING BUT BE MORE PROACTIVE AND USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW. THE DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT -- AGENCIES ARE REVIEW TEAM AGENCIES TOGETHER TO PROACTIVELY LOOK AT WATERSHEDS IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS THAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY -- SO THEY WERE TARGETING THOSE AND REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH BROADER WATERSHED HEALTH GOALS AS PART OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND NOT BEING ENTIRELY. REACTIVE AND JUST LOOKING AT THINGS AFTER THE FACT SO I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMITTEE. TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO THOSE BCP'S. AND I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON WHAT I THINK ARE THE TWO BIGGEST CONCERNS AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR RAISING THESE -- WITH REGARDS TO THOSE TWO PROVISIONS THAT DIRECT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO DO ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY FOUNDATIONAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS BROADER PROGRAM. IF YOU TALK TO ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE YOU KNOW VARIOUS FUELS REDUCTION ACTIVITIES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE QUANTIFICATION METHODOLOGIES. FOR HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT IT HAS BEEN THERE'S THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE. AND THERE'S THAT OR A LESS RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT ARE YOU KNOW. IF AIR WE DOESN'T HAVE RESOURCES TO DO THAT WELL WE'RE NOT GOING TO END UP WITH A GOOD SYSTEM WE MIGHT END UP WITH A SYSTEM BUT IT WON'T BE THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD REALLY HELP US FACILITATE. THE TYPE OF THE SCALE OF WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HAVING TO INTEGRATE WELL INTO THE REST OF OUR ACCOUNTING WORK THE A. R. B. AS ALREADY DOING AND DOING SO WELL. I THINK IT'S REALLY WILL BE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH TO NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME RESOURCES TO DO A GOOD JOB -- STREAMLINING THE QUANTIFICATION METHODS FOR THE FUEL REDUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE OTHER IS ESTABLISHING A CREDIBLE BASELINE FOR WHAT SORT OF EMISSIONS LOSING FROM FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORICALLY. THAT PUTS ALL OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN CONTEXT ABSENT HAVING THAT INFORMATION IN A GOOD RELIABLE SCIENTIFICALLY CREDIBLE WAY WE'RE JUST SORT OF FLAILING AROUND THE DARKENED LE THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF YOU KNOW. WHAT SORT OF FIRE MISSIONS WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW? AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD -- WITH THE STATE'S GOAL OF ESTABLISHING -- CARBON THE TRIAL A PATH TO CARBON THE TROLLEY BY. TWENTY FORTY FIVE HAVING SOME CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT. BASELINE OF EMISSIONS IS UNDER SORT OF AN ECOLOGICALLY STABLE CONDITION IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE AND FIRE SUPPRESSION AND ALL THAT AMENDMENT ACTIVITIES. THAT'S AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT -- THE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH TO NOT MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THAT PART WELL AND WITH THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BRING INTO IT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION THAT'S THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM ALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL THEIR DISTRICTS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING AT COOPERATIVELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S AT PRESCRIBED. FIRE PLANS AND AND FORCED ERROR -- GOALS AND FORESTRY GOALS -- WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BCP TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ALSO -- IN TURN THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS -- TO ENGAGE IN -- INCREASE PRESCRIBED FIRE ACTIVITIES IN OUR REGION SO WE WE'RE JEER AT ADOPTION OF THAT THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT LUCAS FACTS ABOUT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY OF COURSE SUPPORTS THE OVERALL -- LEGISLATIVE -- WILDFIRE RECOVERY IN AT PREVENTION BCP BUT WE ALSO WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT A FEW SPECIFIC ITEMS SPECIFICALLY THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SUPPOSED TO BE SPENT AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. FROM DRF -- FOR FORCED HEALTH AND THERE CONSISTENT WITH SB NOT A ONE I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THE PACE AND SCALE OF ECOLOGICALLY. BASED FORCE MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED -- IN PARTICULAR GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE AND URGENCY OF THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION WE ARE ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF CALPERS REQUEST FOR TWO POINT FIVE MILLION TO INCREASE THE STATE OF USE THAT STATE THE USE EXCUSE ME PRESCRIBED FIRE. THAT MEET THEIR GOALS OF SB AT TWELVE SIXTY AND THEN LASTLY JUST WOULD SAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE EFFORTS AND WORK OF CHIEF PORTER AND HOW HIS STAFF CAL FIRE AND HELPING PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. I'M MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF HUMBLED REDWOOD COMPANY MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANY AND MY CLIENTS AS WELL AS THE TIMBER INDUSTRY AND MYSELF FOR THAT MATTER WERE. HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE ADOPTION OF THE BILL PREVIOUSLY REFERENCED A. B..

TO TO PROVISIONS IN AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AND THE SPEAKS MORE BROADLY THAN JUST THE DFW. OUR REQUEST AND WE DO CONCUR WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISING YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS DRAWING SOME AT LEAST QUESTION -- TO THAT FUNDAMENTALLY WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES IN FRONT OF YOU TO EVALUATE PROPERLY EVALUATE. THIS AND THE OTHER RELATED REQUEST DUE TO LACK OF HAVING THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN REPORTS IN FRONT OF YOU AS WELL AS FOR THE PRIVATE. REGULATED SECTOR TO BE AWARE. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY MY CLIENT WANTS TO EXPRESS CONCERN WITH THE FAILURE -- TO CREATE THOSE PROVISIONS TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES WE HAVE BEEN ANXIOUSLY WAITING SINCE. TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THE AGENCY IN THE DEPARTMENTS BEGAN LOOKING AT THAT. AND I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION SPECIFICALLY TO THE STATUTE IN PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR. FOR SIX TO NINE POINT TWO AND JUST NOTE TO PROVISIONS IF I COULD SUBDIVISION F. WHICH SAYS TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY IN REGULATORY COSTS IN PROGRAMS THROUGH THE CREATION. OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE STATE'S FOREST PRACTICE REGULATORY PROGRAM AND SIMPLIFY THE COLLECTION AND USE OF CRITICAL DATA TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER PERTINENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS. AND ONE QUICK SENTENCE FROM SUBDIVISION G. THE CALLS UPON THESE ENTITIES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT EFFICIENCIES IN THE REGULATION OF TIMBER HARVESTING BETWEEN THE STATE AGENCIES. THAT HAS YET TO OCCUR IN THE HALF A DOZEN PLUS YEARS THAT HE BE FOURTEEN NINETY TWO HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS THANK YOU. JOSH DUGGAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE WILDFIRE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES FOR COUNTIES AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT THIS CRITICAL AREA. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL OF ON THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PLAN CITING NOT ABOUT CALIFORNIA. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY A GOING IN A LINE IN THE COMMENTS FROM MISTER MASON FROM PACIFIC FOR STRESSED. OVER BOTH OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS -- AS WELL AS JUST PUT A FINER POINT ON A COUPLE NOTING IN IN A SETTING LIKE THIS. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW GENERALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FORCE MANAGEMENT -- AND FORCED HEALTH INTERVENTIONS WITH THAT'S FOR STUNNING AT CENTER -- IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH THE THE BENEFITS THAT WERE GOING AFTER THEIR FROM AN ECOLOGICAL STANDPOINT AND AND THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT EXIST -- FOR PREVENTING THE KIND OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ALWAYS UP IN PARADISE WHERE THERE YOU KNOW WE SAW -- A NEED FOR FOR HOME HARDENING AGAINST MEMBERS -- IS REALLY A CRITICAL PIECE TO TO ENSURING THAT WERE ABLE TO AVOID SOME OF THESE -- CATASTROPHES IN THE FUTURE -- AND NOT TO COMPLETE THE TO NECESSARILY AS BEING AS ONE BEING THE SOLUTION FOR THE OTHER THAT THEY'RE BOTH VERY IMPORTANT WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH -- BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY -- WE WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE MAKING THE CLAIM THAT BY DOING THESE FORCED HEALTH MANAGEMENT VENGEANCE ALONE WE WILL BEEN PREVENT -- SOME OF THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- BUT BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT HOPEFULLY IS IS SOMETHING THAT -- MOST FOLKS AND IN THIS ROOM CAN AGREE RELATES TO THE DATA DEVELOPING THE BASS LINES THAT AND THAT MISTER MASON -- SPOKE ON THAT THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL DATA -- WE HAVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US NOW INCLUDING LIGHTER WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME DISCUSSIONS NOW WITH DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ABOUT THE THE ABILITY TO THAN YOU REALIZE THAT DATA ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS IT'S IT'S VERY -- IT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS FOR CROSS POLLINATION OF IDEAS RIGHT.

AND WILL AT OUR COMMENTS AS APPROPRIATE. ALL RIGHT -- SO ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS ENHANCED FIRE PART -- FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES -- AGAIN THIS IS -- CAL FIRE AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS -- REQUESTING -- NINETY FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND WHICH IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS. THAT IS -- IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN AND IT IS OKAY. TO SERVICE A COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF OF FIRE PREVENTION TOOLS AND AND THE THE PERSONNEL TO MAKE SURE THOSE TOOLS ALL ALL WORK TOGETHER IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL FIRE ENGINES INCREASED HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS -- DEDICATED -- SEE SEE SEE FIRE CREWS AS AS DIRECTOR SAIDO MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY -- THE C. ONE THIRTY AIR TANKERS LARGE AIR TANKERS THAT WILL EXTEND -- ALL OF OUR FLEET OF AIR TANKERS INCLUDING THE S. TWOS WE CURRENTLY RUN -- IT FOR UP TO THIRTY YEARS FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE OF THEN -- PREVIOUSLY OF WERE CAPABLE OF THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELLNESS. AND OF OF CAL FIRE AND THEN -- FIRE DETECTION CAMERA AND MAKING A ONE TIME MOBILE EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT FUNDING -- PERMANENT AGAIN THAT -- WHICH IS THE THREE THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'VE ASKED -- FOR TO PUT BACK IN OUR BUDGET. THE AGAIN -- AL'S WITH -- ITEMS ARE NUMBER -- ONE ON THE CAL FIRE SIDE OF THAT THE THE ASSEMBLY -- YOUR STAFF HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB. ON OUTLINING WHAT EACH OF THESE -- ELEMENTS REALLY MEANS AND AND WHAT THE FUNDING GOES -- TO SO OF THE SEVEN I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO GREAT DETAIL IN THOSE -- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME BECAUSE OF THE THE THE THE GREAT ASSESSMENT THAT WAS DONE. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THERE IS THESE ARE ALL -- CONSIDER TO BE -- IMPORTANT -- AS AS A WHOLE SUITE OF TOOLS -- I CAN'T SAY THAT ANY ONE OF THEM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OTHER ALL OF THEM WILL WORK TOGETHER -- TO WORK TOWARD MEETING OUR OUR EXTENDED SEASON RESPONSE AS WELL AS OUR FUEL REDUCTION -- PROJECT WORK -- AND PROVIDE THE CAL VIDEO OF US TO MEET MEET OUR MISSION IN DOING BOTH OF THOSE THINGS -- THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THIS IS AGAIN A A BALANCED APPROACH -- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY AN INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS -- AT LOOKING AT NOT NECESSARILY EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED -- GOING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW WE NEED -- WHILE WE'RE MOVED IT MOVING FORWARD AND DOING A FULL ASSESSMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT'S CAPABILITIES AND DEPLOYMENT ACROSS THE STATE -- TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OF WHAT WHERE WE ARE POTENTIALLY DEFICIENT OR WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE ON NEW OR RESOURCES AROUND THE STATE IN ORDER. TO TO BETTER SERVE THIS ITEM -- WE DO KNOW THAT. THAT -- ARE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR OUR FIREFIGHTERS IS -- REALLY PARAMOUNT TO MAKING ALL OF THIS WORK. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FIREFIGHTERS AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT THEM -- I GET THIS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE DOING THIS THIS IMPORTANT WORK AND FINALLY. RELATED -- TO COMMENT STAFF COMMENTS. ON RC -- ONE THIRTY APPROVED. PROGRAM -- THEY'LL AO HAS THE THE THAT THIS REMAIN OPEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH LA -- TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN REQUESTED -- AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE THAT ANALYSIS ONCE ONCE WE HAVE IT DONE. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM A ALEJO. THIS COMPUTERS WITH ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND I THINK JUST STARTING UP VERY QUICKLY IN TERMS OF BIG PICTURE SO YOU JUST DISCUSSED IN THE AND FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT OVERALL WILD FIRE FUNDING THIS IS REALLY THE OTHER BIG PIECE -- AND SO THAT THE GOVERNOR AND HIS BUDGET WHERE HE'S GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED -- BY CURRENT LAW THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS REALLY FOCUSING ON ENHANCING FIRE RESPONSE AND SUPPRESSION CAPACITY. IT'S A SORT OF IN CONTRAST TO THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT WAS MORE FOCUSED ON FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION. AND SO ONE THING THAT YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS YEAH AS YOU BALANCE THESE LARGER FUNDING PRIORITIES AND YOU KNOW IS ADDING EVERYTHING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED IS DO YOU WANT THAT ON THE FIRE RESPONSE SIDE VERSUS. DOING MORE FOREST HEALTH AND SO SO THOSE GIVE ME SOME OF THE ALSO FITS INTO YOUR OVERALL BUDGET PACKAGE -- IN TERMS OF THE THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL HERE. AND SO YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT AT YOUR HEARING LAST WEEK -- WITH RESPECT TO THAT PROPOSITION PROPOSITION SIXTY AND SOME OF THE TECHNICAL PROPOSALS HOW AND OUR OFFICE AND I THINK LEGISLATIVE STAFF THIS OR FELT THERE IS A LACK OF OF DETAIL AND THAT COULD. SORT OF HINDER TRANSPARENCY IN TERMS OF HAVING THE INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO EVALUATE WHEN ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN OR WHAT ON MAY BE IN THE PAST WOULD HAVE BEEN SEPARATE ISSUES ARE SEPARATE PROPOSALS AND PACKAGE THEM. TOGETHER THAT WAS SOMEWHAT THE CASE WITH THIS -- PROPOSAL AS WELL AND SO IN TERMS OF SORT OF TECHNICAL BUDGETING SPEAK WE RECEIVED ONE AND BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT HAD. I'M ESSENTIALLY MULTIPLE PROPOSALS -- WITHIN AS OUTLINED BY AT DIRECTOR PORTER. AND AND THAT ADDS UP TO THIS ROUGHLY NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FIND OUT AND THAT'S REQUESTED. AND AND THROUGH PACKAGING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER WERE NOT -- PROVIDED AND THAT ADMINISTRATION CAL FIRE AND FINANCE HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE AND PROVIDING US WITH INFORMATION. AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT THAT'S MAYBE SOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC JUST IN THAT IT'S THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE PUBLICLY AND SO FOR IN OF THE LARGER PUBLIC AND FOR ON GOING OVERSIGHT AND AND TRACKING OF THE HISTORY AND THAT'S MAYBE NOT AN IDEAL WAY TO DO THINGS. AND THAT THE LACK OF INFORMATION WAS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC WITH THIS SEE WHEN THIRTY PROPOSAL. AND THE AYE AYE AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEEN VENN VERY FORTHCOMING AND AND WORKING WITH US THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ON THAT. ON THE FUNDING FOR THE SEA WHEN THIRTIES GROWS CONSIDERABLY INTO THE FUTURE YEARS AS MORE PLANES ARE AT DELIVER THESE ESSENTIALLY PLANES THAT THE STATE IS RECEIVING FOR FREE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT WILL HAVE CONSIDERABLE COSTS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THOSE PLANES -- AND SO I APPRECIATE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD ITEM OPENED WE COMMIT TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE MINISTRATION. TO GET THAT INFORMATION AND AND REALLY AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE PIECES OF FUNDING. I'M ARE JUSTIFIED AND MAKES SENSE AND AND THAT IT FULLY FINDS -- THE THIS THE ONE THIRTY PROGRAM THAT CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSING. AND AND AND THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A THAT YOU HAVE A FULL PICTURE OF WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO COST. AND THE OTHER PIECE RELATED TO THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS AND IT -- DIRECTOR PORTERS ARE MENTIONED THAT THESE ARE MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING THAT THAT CAL FIRE THINKS IT NEEDS TO DO BUT THESE ARE THE INITIAL STEPS ARE THE STEPS THIS YEAR THAT THEY COULD TAKE. AND IN THE CURRENT YEAR YOU PROVIDED AND I THINK IT WAS A CLOSE TO TURNER MILLION DOLLARS. ENHANCING FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE ANOTHER CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. GIVEN THE CONDITION AND THE SEVERITY OF FIRES IN THE STATE IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU'LL SEE PROPOSALS OF THIS MAGNITUDE. IN FUTURE YEARS -- AND WE WE JUST KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PUT FORWARD A RECENT ASSESSMENT THAT WE FEEL ACCURATELY. REALLY LAYS OUT WHAT IS THE FIRE RISK RESPONSE CAPACITY IN THE STATE -- AND WHERE THE GAPS AND IS HAVING THAT KIND OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO REALLY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AS YOUR PERMIT YOU KNOW APPROVING ARE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE THIRTEEN A FIRE ENGINES OR FUNDING FOR AIR TANKERS AN INCREASING STAFFING HOW DOES THAT FIT INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE. AND REALLY ENSURING THAT WHERE YOU'RE PLACING YOUR LIMITED DOLLARS IS MEETING THOSE HIGHEST PARTY NEEDS. I'M DIRECTOR PORTERS INDICATED THAT CAL FIRE ON ON OF ITS OWN INITIATIVE HAS ALREADY STARTED WORKING ON AN ASSESSMENT SORT OF ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE RECOMMEND -- WE DO THINK THAT YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE ON THE AND IF I CITY GOES BEYOND JUST BUT TING THE ACTIVATION STAND PARTNERS AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO HAVE MORE CAL FIRE ENGINES OR SHOULD WE BE BOLSTERING THE LOCAL AID SYSTEM AND WHAT'S THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH AND DOES THAT DIFFER DEPENDING ON WHAT REGION OF THE STATE. AND AND AND AND THOSE TYPES OF QUESTIONS AND SO WE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU AND EVEN EVEN THOUGH HOW FAR THIRTY DURING THIS ASSESSMENT WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT. AND THAT WOULD ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ASSESSMENT MEETS ITS GOALS AND PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT WE THAT WE REALLY THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IN FUTURE YEARS. AND YOU KNOW TO TO BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIRTEEN THEIR ENGINES IS THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR EXAMPLE AND AS AS THESE REQUEST CONTINUE TO COME. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS. MET MS GARCIA AND MISTER PATTERSON. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO TO THAT REPORT IN FACT THEY WERE TRYING TO LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY MOVING FORWARD AS WE NOW HAVE A YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON -- JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE STARTING TO FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH -- AND THE PTSD THAT THESE FIREMEN ARE DEALING WITH AND I HOPE. AS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'RE TRACKING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THROUGH THESE PILOTS THEY ARE THE BEST WAY TO HELP OUR SERVICE MEN OUT THERE THERE'S BEEN SOME REPORTS OUT THERE OF THE STRUGGLES AND WE WERE STILL THIS YOU. AND THE CRISIS THAT WE FORGET THAT THESE THESE LONG JUST WANTED TO COMMEND YOU ON THAT BUT WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE TRACKING THAT ALONG THE WAY THAT WE ARE. YOU SEEN THE BEST SERVICES TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT AND WE WILL. MISTER PATTERSON. JUST COUPLE OF REMIND ME HOW MANY SEE ONE THIRTIES AND HOW SOON DO YOU EXPECT THEM ONLINE. I'M GONNA ASK -- CHIEF TYLER TO COVER THAT -- SPECIFICALLY. HELLO SIR -- JOE TYLER I CAL FIRE CHIEF FIRE PROTECTION. YOUR QUESTION REGARDING C. ONE THIRTIES -- THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT -- NGUYEN -- WORKING WITH THE UNITED STATES A COAST GUARD IN THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE. TO RETROFIT CURRENT S. C. ONE THIRTY HERCULES MODEL AIRCRAFT INTO -- CAPABLE AND EFFECTIVE A FIRE -- OVER A PERIOD OF TIME ENDING HOPEFULLY BY AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IN WHICH WE WILL HAVE THE DELIVERY OF SEVEN A C. ONE THIRTY AIRCRAFT. OF THE SEVEN FIVE WILL GO IN SERVICE -- TO WILL REMAIN AS MAINTENANCE SPARES AND RESERVES [inaudible] AND THE THE TIME FOR THE HELICOPTERS COMING ON HOW SOON IS THAT. WE APPRECIATE THE THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO REPLACE THE SUPER HUEY HELICOPTERS -- WE HAVE PURCHASED A TOTAL OF FIVE OF THE A BLACK HAWK S. SEVENTY AYE HELICOPTERS THE FIRST HELICOPTER SHOULD ARRIVE -- BY MAY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT MCCLELLAN WHICH IS OUR AVIATION MANAGEMENT UNIT -- TO BE -- OPEN AND TRANSPARENT TO OF THE SECOND S. SEVENTY AYE A HELICOPTER THAT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES -- ON A TRUCK TO TEXAS -- WAS INVOLVED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT -- IN TENNESSEE ON AN ICY ROAD -- THE SIKORSKY STAFF AS WELL AS OUR STAFF -- HAVE EVALUATED IN SOUTH CAROLINA -- WORKING THROUGH A DISCUSSIONS ON YOU WILL ACCEPTED AFTER REPAIRED -- AND THEN -- IF ACCEPTABLE WE SHOULD SEE THE SECOND AIRCRAFT IN APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE MAY DELIVERY [inaudible] FIVE WHAT IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HELICOPTERS AUTHORIZED -- WE HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED OVER OF FOUR YEARS -- TWELVE HELICOPTERS TEN OF WITCHER ARE IN SERVICE AND TO ARM -- MAINTENANCE AND RESERVE. AND OF THOSE TWELVE FIVE HAVE BEEN PURCHASED AND ARE EITHER HERE OR COMING. SOON FIVE HAVE A PURCHASE ORDER HAS BEEN WRITTEN FOR FIVE OF THE AIRCRAFT OF THE NEXT -- FOUR THAT PURCHASE ORDER WOULD BE -- WRITTEN IF APPROVED ON OR AFTER. JULY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST A QUICK COMMENT -- ON THE ISSUE OF OF FIRE FIGHTING AIRCRAFT -- I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH US SOMEONE RECENTLY WHO WAS QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE ON THE ON THE OVERALL TOPIC -- AND IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THERE NO -- FIREFIGHTING SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT ANYWHERE AND EVERYTHING LIKE THE AIRCRAFT YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT -- HAS TO BE RETROFITTED -- AND TO THE DISCUSSION THAT ENSUED WAS -- WHETHER IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT TO FIND A WAY -- TO ORDER -- AND CREATE A A AN AIRCRAFT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO SOME OF THE VERY SPECIFIC TASKS AT THE FIRE SERVICE HAS -- SO I PUT THAT OUT THERE NOT FOR TOPIC OF DISCUSSION TODAY BUT SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT I THINK -- CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE -- THAT IS SEEING INCREASED FIRE RISK -- WE KNOW THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE ON INTO THE FUTURE THERE ARE PLACES -- AS FAR FROM US IS -- PORTUGAL AND AUSTRALIA IN THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT -- ACTUALLY COULD CREATE A MARKET PLACE -- FOR A FIRE SPECIFIC IT'S THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE THE COOPERATION OF THE MILITARY IN SOME WAY. BUT SOMETHING TO PONDER AND THINK ABOUT AND WONDER WHETHER -- THAT MIGHT TO OVERTIME INCREASE OUR OUR EFFECTIVENESS. AND SO IT UP ON HIS RACE DID I MISS YOU I APOLOGIZE I DID. MISS PETERS -- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE? THE ASSESSMENT THE LONG TERM ASSESSMENT. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS -- SPECIFIC REQUESTS COMING THROUGH -- WHO IS AT THE SHOULD PUT IT TOGETHER WHO SHOULD OVERSEE IT? HOW OFTEN SHOULD BE REVIEWED WHAT ARE YOU ENVISIONING? SURE SO AND WE WOULD ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED THE ASSESSMENT RATHER THAN JUST RELYING ON THE MINISTRATION TO DO IT OF ITS OWN VOLITION THAT WAY YOU HAVE -- THE ABILITY TO HAVE INPUT IN TERMS OF WHAT GOES INTO IT AND THE TIME LINES AS AND WHEN IT COMES BACK TO YOU -- THAT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR HOW YOU CAN REQUIRE REPORTS AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL LANGUAGE REPORT THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE BUDGET IS IS ONE OPTION. AND AND WE THINK THAT THE HIGHER BUT IN IN COORDINATION A WITH THE OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES -- AGAIN FOR THE REASON THAT WHILE IT CALIFORNIA HAS AB YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS UNDER THEIR PURVIEW. AND WE WE DO THINK THAT THE ASSESSMENT SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT HOW CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AS WELL AS MUTUAL AID SYSTEM SINCE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RESPONDING TO AND SMALL FIRES AND CERTAINLY VERY LARGE FIRES. AND IT'S NOT JUST CAL FIRE RESOURCES EVEN IF THE FIRE IS ON THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA THAT THAT WE'RE OFTENTIMES ACTIVATING THAT. DOT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND SO. ON JUST THINKING ABOUT AT WHAT WHERE THE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE OR THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WILL HAVING THAT HOLISTIC PICTURE SO WE THINK THAT THE REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE ON CAL FIRE. AND THAT THAT THEY ALSO COORDINATE WITH -- YES AND WE LAY OUT IN OUR AND IN OUR REPORT SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE LOOKED AT THE CAPACITY. GAPS IN CAPACITY LOOKING AT ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES SO FIRE ENGINES AND AN AIRCRAFT AND THEY CAME UP IN A JOINT HEARING LAST WEEK LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY AND WHITE RENO ROLLED IS THERE FOR EXAMPLE THE CAMERAS THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. AND AND AND ENSURE THIS IS SORT OF A APPROACH AND TO ADDRESS SAYING ADDRESSING WILDFIRES LOOKING FORWARD AND AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO IT SORT OF WORK WITH YOU ON THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT MIGHT GO INTO. REQUIRE YOU KNOW THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE REQUIRED AND NOT ASSESSMENT AND WE DO THINK THE PRIORITIZATION AND LINKING IT BACK TO GOALS IS IMPORTANT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ASSESSMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT OUT. I'M SEVERAL YEARS BACK THAT AND ARE MAYBE MORE OF JUST A SURVEY OF YOU KNOW WHAT DO FOLKS WANT -- AS OPPOSED TO HAVING AS AS YOU KNOW THAT FISCAL LOOK AT IT AS WELL IF OKAY WELL WHAT DO WE WHAT DO WE REALLY NEED AND IN WHAT AREAS AND AND HOW DOES THAT HELP US ACHIEVE SPECIFIC GOALS HOW IS BACK IN AND IMPROVE THE ABILITY IN A FIRE. RESPONSE TIMES AND OR HOW WAS I CAN APPROVE IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO HANDLE MULTIPLE LARGE AND WILD FIRE INCIDENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME. IT CHIEF EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT -- ONE OF MY QUESTIONS EARLIER ABOUT HAVING THE THE LONG TERM PLAN -- AND GOES ALONG WITH THE ASSESSMENT IS A SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT. WHERE ARE WE ON THEM? GREAT QUESTION MEMBER IS WHERE WE ARE IS JUST STARTING WITH OUR WITH OUR ASSESSMENT IT'S PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN THAT JUST ROLLED OUT. LAST MONTH. OF FOR THE COMING OF FIVE YEARS. AND SO WE ARE STARTING ON THAT -- WE HAVE NOT LAUNCHED YET -- BUT I DO WANT -- TO REFERENCE THAT IT IS A CAL FIRE STRATEGIC PLAN ELEMENT. AND CAL FIRES MISSION IS IS -- PRIMARILY FOR THE WILD LAND AND THE S. R. RAY THIS IS SPECIFIC TO THE WHAT OUR INTENT HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED. TO MANAGE OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE S. R. RAY RELATED TO INITIAL ATTACK AN EXTENDED ATTACK FROM THE CAL FIRE PERSPECTIVE. WE WILL -- BE COGNIZANT OF A OR SHOULD WE GO FORTH AS WE PLAN -- WE WE WILL BE COGNIZANT OF THE MUTUAL AID RESPONSE AND HOW THAT FITS IN. AND ALSO WORK WITH THOUGH YES TO HELP US UNDERSTAND. HOW THOSE RESOURCES ARE -- EITHER -- INCREASING OR DWINDLING DEPENDING ON WHAT WHAT THEY HAVE ASSESSED. AND SO THAT WILL INFORM SOME OF OUR DECISIONS BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS IS THAT INITIAL ATTACK AN EXTENDED ATTACK. IN THE WILD LAND -- PRIVATE LANDS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS A STATE -- FIRST AND FOREMOST WITHOUT AND THEN BRING IN THE SUPPORT FOR IT TO BACK US UP AS THINGS CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AND GET BIGGER. AND THAT DOES INCLUDE OUR CONTRACT COUNTY PARTNERS AS WELL SO ALL OF THIS WOULD INCLUDE -- ANY AREA WHERE THERE'S STATE RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BEING COVERED. AND EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT FORCED HEALTH I WOULD ASSUME THAT TOO AS WE WERE WE'RE LOOKING TO JUST AS YOU'VE TOP YOU YOU'VE DESCRIBED HERE BUT ALSO THE PREVENTION. SO THAT WE HAVE LESS. DAMAGE -- COMPARED TO WHAT WE CAN'T. MORE RECENTLY. IF YES AN END TO ADD ADD TO THIS -- WE WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE -- AS WELL AS THE THE ANNUAL -- IF THOSE A ANNUAL INSPECTIONS BUT AS WELL AS THE ANNUAL WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON ON FUELS PROJECTS AND COMMUNITY DEFENSE PROJECTS -- AND AS WE IN ARE ARE YEAR ROUND STAFFING PARTICULARLY WITH THE FIRE ENGINES THAT THAT ARE REFERENCED IN IN THIS BUDGET -- THOSE YEAR ROUND RESOURCES NOT ONLY BY US THE THE THE FIRE THE EXTRA FIRE RESOURCES DURING THE PEAK OF FIRE SEASON AND EXTRA FIRE ENGINES. BUT THEY ALSO ALLOW US TO HAVE STAFF AND THOSE ENGINES AVAILABLE FOR DOING PRESCRIBED BURNING. FUELS PROJECTS AND INSPECTIONS DURING THAT WINTER PERIOD WHERE WHERE TYPICALLY OTHER RESOURCES ARE ARE DOWN STAFF THOSE THAT THOSE WILL REMAIN STAFFED AND BE ABLE -- TO INCREASE THOSE THOSE ASPECTS. AND THEN FINALLY IF I MAY -- THE THERE'D BEEN SOME -- COMMENTS REGARDING THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS FOR TO DIE YOU WAIT THEY WERE REALLY ON TRACK SHOULD WE BE MOVING OUR RESOURCES TO A DIFFERENT AREA. IN THE END WE WANT WHAT IS BEST AND YOU'RE THE EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THIS TO TELL US YOU YOU HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE PLACE THE MONEY. IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND WE HAVE TO MOVE IT. HOW DO WE MOVE IT SO IN THE COLLECTION OF DATA ARE ARE ARE YOU ARE YOU PARTICIPATING IN DETERMINING WHAT THE DATA IS IT NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED -- HOW WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR THAT WHERE IS THAT DATA COLLECTED WARS IT WHERE IS IT? WHOSE EVALUATING. THE AND THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AS WELL AND AND WE WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OF THESE FIRE SUPPRESSION AND FUELS RELATED RESOURCE -- AGAINST OUR TARGETS -- FOR DOING THOSE TYPES OF WORK -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PREVIOUSLY THE THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND THE AND THE THE THE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE GOING OUT TO PROJECT WORK ON THE GROUND? WE WILL ASSESS THE THE AFFECTS OF THOSE AND ALSO -- INTEGRATE THE MAP WE HAVE A MAPPING TOOL THAT WILL SHOW THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE PROJECTS AS THEY'RE BEING COMPLETED. AND AND SHOW HOW -- THE FEDERAL PROJECTS THAT ON FEDERAL LAND AND THEN THE PRIVATE LAND PROJECTS AND THEN THE PRIVATE TIMBER TIMBER INDUSTRY PROJECTS AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING ON ON THE LANDSCAPE WILL ALL BE.

FIRST PROGRAM THAT WE HEARD ABOUT -- REALLY IS IT'S VOLUNTARY BUT IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE PUT ALL OF THOSE ALL OF THAT DATA INTO THAT PROGRAM TO BE ABLE. TO GET A A BROAD LOOK AT WHAT. WHAT WE REALLY WHAT IMPACT WE REALLY ARE HAVING AND HOW THOSE IMPACTS THEN ARE ABLE -- TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF OF A PARTICULAR MATTER IN PARTICULAR.

THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN -- IN THE CALIFORNIA -- FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. FOR MULTIPLE YEARS AND RECENTLY OUR MAYBE INNER EMILY HAVE DROPPED OFF AT DIFFERENT POINTS -- IS DUE TO A GENERAL FUND OF FUNDING CONSTRAINTS DURING THE RECESSION -- WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THESE THESE ARE -- PROJECTS THAT SHOW AS NEW -- BUT THEY ARE OLD PROJECTS TO THE PLAN THEY HAVE BEEN ON THE PLAN FOR IT IN THE PAST. APPROXIMATELY 80% OF CALIFORNIA'S -- FACILITIES WERE CONSTRUCTED PRE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SO WE HAVE A A LIFE CYCLE OF OF APPROXIMATELY FIFTY YEARS ON ON OUR STRUCTURES AND AND WE HAVE REACHED THAT IN MANY OF IN MANY CASES -- THE OLDER FACILITIES -- ARGUE ARE NO LONGER LARGE ENOUGH TO FIT THE CURRENT FIRE ENGINES -- AN APPARATUS THAT WE HAVE -- THEY HAVE -- THEY ARE NOT BUILT TO CURRENT CODES -- AND THEY ALSO HAVE. SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE BERRICS IS THAT ARE NOT -- IT IS SUITABLE TO TODAY'S WORKFORCE -- MEANING THEY'RE VERY OPEN AND NOT A LOT OF PRIVACY -- FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND GENDER RELATED ISSUES -- ARE ARE A RESTROOM FACILITIES ARE VERY MUCH IN THAT SAME KIND OF OPEN FORMAT AND REALLY WERE -- CREATED FOR A SINGLE GENDER TYPE ISSUES.

SEARCH ASSEMBLY AWESOME COMMENTS OUT YET JUST A NO WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THAT THE PROPOSAL'S BUT JUST TO TEN NOTE FOR YOUR LONGER TERM BUDGET PLANNING THAT. I'M AT THE FORTY MILLION THAT'S PROPOSED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS FOR CALIFORNICUM ONLY IN IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS TO INITIATE NINE NEW PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THOSE NINE PROJECTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TOTAL I IN ORDER TO DESIGN AND CONSTRUCT THOSE PROJECTS. WHO -- I AM SEEING NO HANDS GO UP SO -- LET'S MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUES -- SEVEN AND EIGHT SEEING NO ONE STEP FORWARD WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON ISSUE EIGHT TO APPROVE. SOME OF THE YOU. BLOOM I FONG. GARCIA. MULLIN PATTERSON. RADIUS REVERSE. WHICH TAKES US TO OUR LAST ISSUE OF THE DAY ISSUE. NINE CONTRACT COUNTY CAPITAL OUTLAY. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE RIGHT BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR LUNCH. BUT I AM THE LESS. SO. THIS IS OUR CONTRACT COUNTY -- CAPITAL OUTLAY -- REQUEST CAL FIRE IS REQUESTING -- THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND TO RESTORE STATUTORILY REQUIRED -- PROPORTIONAL FUNDING TO THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES OF LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY SANTA BARBARA COUNTY -- VENTURA COUNTY AND KERN COUNTY AND MARIN COUNTY CZ ALMOST WENT BACK TO MONTEREY. IT SHOULDN'T DO THAT IN MARIN COUNTY -- THIS REQUEST IS -- IS RELATED TO AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT COULD THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES -- TO HAVE A PROPORTIONAL -- ALLOCATION THAT IS APPROXIMATELY THEY CAL FIRE ALLOCATION. IS AND IT'S A LIKE FOR LIKE -- FROM THE PRIOR -- CAPITAL OUTLAY -- BUDGET YEAR. SO -- THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS -- IT WOULD BE ADJUSTED -- BASED ON THAT 19% OF WHAT CAL FIRES -- ALLOCATION IS -- AND THAT IS WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION AND AND WHAT -- IT MEETS THE METHOD ALL SET UP IN AGREEMENT WITH THE SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES. THANK YOU QUESTIONS [inaudible] OHIO [inaudible] AND SO. WE THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO CONSIDER GIVING I'M CAPITAL A FUNDING TO THE CONTRACT COUNTY SUBCONTRACT COUNTIES ARE PROVIDING A SERVICE TO CAL FIRE AND HAVING FIRE STATIONS AND OTHER FACILITIES IS NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THEM TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. ON THE FUNDING OF FOR THIS PURPOSE HAVE I WAS ELIMINATED IN THAT TWELVE THIRTEEN BUDGET AND SO HASN'T BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST DECADE -- IF IT'S A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR OVERALL GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES TO REINSTATE THE SPENDING WE DO THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE. AND THOUGH THE FORMULA AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO REINSTATE THOUGH WE FIND IT DOESN'T REALLY TRACK WITH WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF VARIABILITY IN THE FUNDING FOR THAT SO HOW THAT FORMULA THAN A PLACE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. THE ANNUAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR CONTRACT COUNTIES WOULD HAVE RANGED FROM NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ONE YEAR TO BE SPLIT AMONGST THE SIX COUNTIES. SO NOT VERY MUCH -- IT TO A HIGH OF NINE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HIGHEST YEAR AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE WAY THE FORMULA WORKS AS A PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S A PERCENTAGE BASED ON THE CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES. FOR CALIFORNICA LE HERE AND SO CONSTRUCTION AND THE SAME YEAR THAT'S GOING TO BE A VERY SORT OF HI TAKE THAT AMOUNT TAKE 19% OF THAT. VERSES AND A YEAR WHERE MAYBE CAL FIRE JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE NOT NOT ANY PROJECT STARTING CONSTRUCTION HAPPENED ALL BE IN A DESIGN PHASE FOR THE COSTS ARE LOWER. I AND SO THIS CAN CREATE A LOT OF VARIABILITY IN THE FUNDING AND THAT COULD COMPLICATE AND THE ABILITY FOR CONTRACT COUNTIES TO PLAN FOR USING THAT FUNDING. AND AND IT'S JUST NOT REALLY TIED TO ANY ACTUAL CAPITAL OUTLAY NEEDS. AND THE SO WE WOULD KNOW THAT IT'S PROBABLY NOT COST EFFECTIVE TO GET THE INFORMATION TO ACTUALLY TRACK WHAT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS ARE KIDS IT'S QUITE COMPLICATED YOU HAVE LOCAL FIRE STATIONS THAT ARE SERVING MULTIPLE PURPOSES. BOTH AND DOING THE CONTRACT COUNTY WORK ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS AS WELL AS LOCAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND AND SO. AND IT MIGHT NOT REALLY BE PRUDENT TO TRY TO GET THE INFORMATION TO HAVE SOME SORT OF NEEDS BE BASED APPROACH. AND SO WE THINK THAT MAYBE JUST A SIMPLER APPROACH OF PICKING AMOUNT AND SET THAT AMOUNT IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THIS FUNDING AND THAT WAY YOU CAN PROVIDE A STABLE LEVEL OF FUNDING AND FROM EACH YEAR. AND TO ADD A POINT THAT I KNOW -- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES INDICATE IN THE PAST AS WELL IF THE STATE IS IN A POSITION TO SHUT OFF OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING BECAUSE OF BUDGET CONSTRAINTS YOU COULD ALWAYS DO THE SAME THING EVEN IF YOU. SET A SPECIFIC AMOUNT. AND HOW YOU CHOOSE THAT AMOUNT YOU COULD PICK THE AMOUNT THE GOVERNOR'S BUT IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR WHICH IS THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION WE LOOKED AT WHAT THAT FUNDING WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST ROUGHLY TEN YEARS THE AVERAGE OF THAT SPOT TWO POINT TWO MILLION -- OR YOU CAN PICK SOME OTHER AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH AND YOU COULD ALWAYS SET UP A PROCESS. TO HAVE IT -- INCREASE AND WITH CHANGE AND SO THE REASONABLE IF IT'S ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES BUT WE THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A SIMPLER WAY TO PROVIDE FUNDING. ALL RIGHT -- WITH THAT ARE THERE A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SURE JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS SO I AM JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS METHODOLOGY IS THE METHODOLOGY THAT WE'VE USED HISTORICALLY IT'S NOT ARBITRARY THAT NINETEEN POINT 29%. AND CAL FIRE CAN SPEAK BETTER TO THAT THAN I BUT IT'S IT'S BASED ON SORT OF A LIKE FOR LIKE IN TERMS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT -- THE CONTRACT COUNTIES HAVE IN PROPORTION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AND IN AND WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONCERNS WITH THE METHODOLOGY. AND YEAH BUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE LA -- CONCERNS WERE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONCERNS FROM THE CONTRACT COUNTIES AND AND THIS IS REALLY THAT -- METHODOLOGY OR SORT OF THE VERY ABILITY AND FUNDING IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE DO FOR OUR STATE CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM MEANING WE HAVE SORT OF VARYING AMOUNTS OF FUNDING FROM YEAR TO YEAR THAT WE AT BRING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION. TO YEAH WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION TO HOLD OPEN AND WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC PUBLIC COMMENT THAT. THIS OUR LAST ITEM SO. THANK YOU -- BLOOM MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY CASE AND WEBER ASSOCIATION OF CONTRACT TOWNIES. AND DAYLIGHT IS THE MARIN COUNTY FIRE CHIEF -- YOU KNOW FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND RE ESTABLISHING THIS FUNNY AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO IN PARTNERSHIP -- YOU KNOW I THINK THE COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH CAL FIRE IN THE THE STRONG WORKING RELATIONSHIP OR WHAT BASIS THE SUCCESS AND AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS 19% IS TIED IN PERCENTAGE OF LIKE RESOURCES FOR THIS STATE MISSION THAT WE PROVIDE -- IT'S ALSO IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE TO ESTABLISH THE FUNDING SOURCE ITSELF SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND AND WE MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH STAFF AS NEEDED. SO YOU YOU PREFER THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES METHODOLOGY IS ON A CONTINUING 19% FORMULA YES. OKAY. THANK YOU -- QUESTIONS. AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THIS -- WE HAVE AT OUR VOTES RIGHT SO IT.
