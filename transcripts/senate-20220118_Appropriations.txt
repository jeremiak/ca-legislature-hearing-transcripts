ONCE AGAIN WORK POST THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OUR QUEUE ALL RIGHT HAVING HEARD FROM THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION AGAIN THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO SUSPENSE SEEING NO QUESTIONS. HAVE A QUESTION I DO MISTER CHAIR CURRENT OKAY I WAS JUST. WONDERING GIVEN THE FACT THAT I WAS IN- GEO WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD AND LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS THAT'S IN OUR BINDERS NOW IT IS STRIKINGLY SIMILAR TO THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS IN. G. O. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSION AND A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED THAT WOULD HAVE A FISCAL IMPACT ON THE BILL. AND YET THOSE. COMMENTS OR POINTS WERE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS SO AS A TO THE POINT OF CLARIFICATION FOR ME- ARM. GIVEN I KNOW THIS IS JUST TO PUT IT ON SUSPENSE BEFORE IT GOES BEFORE US AGAIN THE REASON WHY SOME OF THAT WAS NOT CAPTURED AS IT PROBABLY WILL HELP- IN CONTEXTUALIZING. WHAT WE MAY END UP SEEING. THE QUESTION IS A GOOD QUESTION THE ANSWER IS THAT THE PARTIES ARE STILL TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THOSE OUTSTANDING ISSUES SO THE ANALYSIS REFLECTS THE BILL AS- IN PRINT DOES NOT REFLECT THE ONGOING NATURE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT. BEEN SUBMITTED YET. OKAY SO MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT BOY THAT'S WHEN WE SEE THIS BILL AGAIN IF IN FACT THERE ARE. NEGOTIATIONS THAT HAPPEN WHERE ALL PARTIES ARE IN AGREEMENT OR NOT BUT WHAT THE AUTHOR DECIDES THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT'LL BE BEFORE. FOR THE VOTE THAT. BYE SO IF THE BILL WHATEVER AMENDMENTS ARE REFLECTED ON THURSDAY THERE WILL BE AN AMENDED ANALYSIS TO REFLECT THOSE AMENDMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SIGNAL THE QUESTIONS WITHOUT OBJECTION SB SIX TWENTY WILL GO TO SUSPENSE. OUR FINAL BILL THE DAY IS S. B. SIX TWO TWO BY SENATOR ROTH ON STUDENT FINANCIAL AID.
