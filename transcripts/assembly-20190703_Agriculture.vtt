SETTING UP A STATE PROGRAM HERE --

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:10.721
HAS THE IMPLICATION OF ERODING

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.222
LOCAL CONTROL WITHOUT MAKING IT.

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:15.459

SOME VARIANT THE AS WAS

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.338
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BY THE ROLE

TALKS WHY DON'T WE JUST HEARD A

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:41.618
FROM THAT WE'VE AGREED TO I

00:43:41.685 --> 00:43:42.720
APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR BUT I

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:43.754

SO THAT'S A SO IT'S SORT OF

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:51.295
SITUATION WE WERE TOLD ONE THING

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:52.563
LEARN SOMETHING ELSE.

00:43:52.629 --> 00:43:53.197

I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:06.377
THAT THE STATE LEGISLATION COULD

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:07.845
BE USED TO TRY TO PREEMPT THE

00:44:07.911 --> 00:44:09.980
COUNTY THE COUNTY'S ABILITY TO

CHOOSE WHICH PRACTICES ARE MOST

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:31.987

TO DO WITH WILDLIFE HABITAT.

01:21:42.797 --> 01:21:45.567
AND MY SECOND POINT IS THAT THE

01:21:45.634 --> 01:21:47.202
BILL SAYS THE DEPARTMENT MAY

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:48.737

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.675
BUT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:57.178

AMENDED TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THIS

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:28.977
THEN IT REQUIRES CDFA TO

SAME PRACTICES AS THE ALREADY

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:41.923
EXISTING PROGRAMS SO THERE'S TWO

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.425
THINGS HERE THAT NEED TO BE

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.060

FIVE THREE HAD BEEN BEFORE US

01:23:09.017 --> 01:23:10.752
BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE I THINK WE

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.220
WOULD HAVE EMBRACE IT MORE HOLY

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:13.722
BECAUSE THE STATE WAS NOT IN A

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:15.223
POSITION OF PROVIDING INCENTIVES

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.492

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:25.500
NEEDS TO WORK WITH -- PRODUCERS

01:23:25.567 --> 01:23:27.736
TO ADDRESS -- GREATER WEATHER

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:30.271
EXTREMES IMPROVE CARBON SINKS

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:32.307
SAVE WATER AND ENERGY WE NOW

CURRENTLY SB -- TWO FIVE THREE

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:42.884
WE BELIEVE FAILS TO BE

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.552
COMPLEMENTARY TO AND NOT TO PLAY

01:23:44.619 --> 01:23:46.621
COULD HAVE OF THOSE EXISTING

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:47.655

AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEES

01:23:56.898 --> 01:23:58.433
ANALYSIS THAT THERE'S A

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.435
ESPECIALLY IN NEED TO HAVE A

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.404
STREAMLINED APPLICATION PROCESS

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:05.774
FARMERS.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.642
ON THE GROUND ALSO IT'S NOT

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.377
