THESE EVENTS OCCURRED AFTER TWO DEVASTATING YEARS OF WILDFIRES INCLUDING FIRES IGNITED BY YOU TO ELECTRIC UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT MOST NOTABLY THE CAMPFIRE IN PARADISE. AT THE NOVEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN HEARING. FAR COMMITTEE HEARD FROM THE STATE'S THREE LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITIES FROM WROTE RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES FROM AFFECT THE RESIDENCES BUSINESSES DOWNSTREAM SERVICE PROVIDERS AND CRITICAL FACILITIES AMONG OTHERS. THE HEARING FOCUSED ON LESSONS LEARNED AND AREAS THAT MERIT ADDITIONAL ATTENTION. NOW OVER SIX MONTHS SINCE THE NOVEMBER% HEARING AND ON THE CUSP OF THIS YEAR'S WILDFIR SEASON THE NEED TO ENSURE THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE WILDFIRE SEASON IS EVEN MORE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND SHELTERING IN PLACE ORDERS WHICH HAVE LIMITED MOBILITY IN ACTIVITY IN THE STATE DUE TO CALL THE NINETEEN. GLOBAL PANDEMIC. TODAY'S HEARING WILL ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE AN UPDATE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON SPECIFIC ACTIONS TAKEN SINCE LAST FALL TO IMPROVE THE ELECTRIC YOU TOO CHILE'S PLANS AND OPERATIONS INCLUDING THE RECENT REVIEW OF THE UTILITIES WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AND UPDATED PROTOCOLS FOR USING PROACTIVE POWER SHUT OUT POINT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOPS P. S. P. S. ADDITIONALLY THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE THREE ELECTRIC UTILITIES ABOUT THE STATUS. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND THE NEW GUIDELINES ON POWER SHUT OFFS AS WELL AS HOW THE UTILITIES ARE JUST TO THEIR PLANS IN LIGHT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS. THE UPDATES PROVIDED AT THE HEARING OR INTENDED TO INFORM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT THEM WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE SEASON AS COMPARED. TO PAST YEARS TEND TO ENSURE WE ARE APPLYING THE LESSON LEARNED FROM THE RECENT PREVIOUS YEARS EXPERIENCES. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES OF THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND THE CONTINUED NEED TO LIMIT SOCIAL CONGREGATING. THE COMMITTEE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE OF THE CPUC IN FULFILLMENT OF STATUTORY REQUIRED ANNUAL UPDATE TO THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE TO OVER MEMBERS JOIN A JOINING US REMOTELY- WE HAVE SENATOR HILL AND I BELIEVE SENATOR SKINNER. US NOT YET CENTERS SKINNER IN ADDITION TO THE MEMBERS HERE PRESENT.

WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WE HAVE WITH US- THE CPUC PRESIDENT BERUBAH MARABLE BADGER. WE HAVE CAROLINE TIMES JAKE JACOBS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE WILD SAFETY DIVISION WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION. AND RACHEL PETERSON THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY WELCOME COMMISSIONER AND MEMBERS OF THE P. IS SAFE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. AND LEASE- BEGIN WITH A PRESENTATION. AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE AS STATED MY NAME IS VERY WELL THAT YOU'RE AND I SERVICE THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I AM JOINED TODAY AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIR BY MY COLLEAGUES CAROLINE THOMAS JENKINS DIRECTOR WELFARE SAFETY DIVISION RACHEL PETERSON DIRECTOR EXPECT THAT MAKES ACTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT POLICY EDWARD RANDALL. DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY AND ROBERT OSBORNE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION. FIRST YOUR WAY SO I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE COMMITTEE STAFFER SUGGESTING WE PURPOSE THIS REPORT ON THE ISSUES THAT REQUIRE OUR MOST IMMEDIATE ATTENTION GIVEN THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. ECONOMIC DESTRUCTION. AND THE UPCOMING WILDFIRE SEASON. I WANTED ASSURING MEMBERS THAT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO MOVING FORWARD ON ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE. AS WE HAVE FAST TRACKED EXIST ESTABLISHING NEW WELFARE RELATED RULES AND ACTED TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE CONTINUED OUR WORK ON MAINTAINING ENERGY SYSTEM RELIABILITY ENHANCING OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN ON LET TRICITY SECTOR. AND MANAGING THE DECENTRALIZATION OF ELECTRICITY. AND STILL THE ENHANCED AUTHORITY TO REGULATE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS. BUT THAT WILL BEGIN MY PRESENTATION THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE BY COVE IN NINETEEN AND THE SOCIAL INEQUITIES IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED AS REQUIRED FOCUSED AND TIMELY ACTION TO SUPPORT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS OUR STATE. IT HAS CALLED UPON US TO MOVE QUICKLY TO MAINTAIN AND INCREASE ACCESS TO UTILITIES SERVICES THAT IT BECOMES MORE ESSENTIAL DURING THE CURRENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS FAMILIES MOVED TO SHELTER WORK AND LEARN FROM HOME. IS UNDERSTANDING LED TO OUR PLACING AN IMMEDIATE MORATORIUM ON ELECTRIC GAS COMMUNICATIONS AND WATER AND SEWAGE DISCONNECTIONS UNTIL APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE A WE ALSO HAD A PROPOSED DECISION REGARDING JUST CONNECTIONS ON OUR JUNE ELEVENTH VOTING MEDIAN AGENDA THAT WOULD OFFER ADDITIONAL LONG TERM CUSTOMER PROTECTION. AND IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS FROM HIGHER BILLS YEAH INCREASED DEPENDENCY AND USE OF CERTAIN UTILITIES THE CDC HAS SOUGHT RATE RELIEF. EASE OF MEASURES FOR INSTANCE IN ORDER TO REDUCE SEASONAL BILL UNTIL TODAY SDG AT EACH CUSTOMER'S THE SEASONAL DIFFERENTIAL HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE RESIDENTIAL TIERED RATES WE ALSO MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CREDIT TO MINIMIZE THE RATE SHOCK TO REPAIRS FOR THEIR INCREASED ENERGY USE BY MOVING CREDIT FOR P. JEANNIE AND SEP FROMOCTOBER TO MAY AND JUNE. WITH RESPECT TO THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE RATES FOR ENERGY CARE FAMILY ELECTRIC RATE ASSISTANCE CHERUB PROGRAMS WE PROVIDED DIRECTION TO THE UTILITIES ON INCREASING OUTRAGE ON ENROLLMENT AND OUR STAFF IS WORKING WITH THE STATE AGENCIES TO COORDINATE OUTRAGE WITH PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAL FRESH. IN A RELATED EFFORT WE HAVE SOUGHT TO MAINTAIN WORK FOR STABILITY I DIRECTED THE UTILITIES TO MAKE ADVANCE. PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS. ENERGY IS UPGRADES AS OF THE ENERGY SAY ASSISTANCE. IN THE AREA OF COMMUNICATIONS WE HAVE ALSO ACTED QUICKLY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE ARE SUPPORTING K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS BY PROVIDING FIVE MILLION FROM DOLLARS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND TO HELP COVER THE COST OF COMPUTING AND HOT SPOT DEVICES. ALSO PROVIDING TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE CALIFORNIA TELL CONNECT FUND FOR HOT SPOTS IN INTERNET SERVICE FOR STUDENTS HOUSEHOLDS. THE CPUS ALSO WORKING TO MAKE THE LIFELINE PROGRAM MORE ACCESSIBLE BY CONNECTING PROVIDERS WITH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND MAKING IT EASIER TO STAY ON BY SUSPENDING PROGRAM RE CERTIFICATIONS FOR NINETY DAYS. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT OUR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE VOLUNTARY ACTIONS ON ISSUES CRITICAL TO CUSTOMERS WE ASKED WIRELESS CARRIERS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ELIMINATE DATA CAPS AND COVERAGE CHARGES. EXCUSE ME OVERAGE CHARGES AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW INCOME BROADBAND SERVICE. BUILDING NINETEEN HAS ALSO IMPACTED OVERALL ENERGY USE WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE AN IMPACT ON RATES I WILL COVER THIS LATER IN THE PRESENTATION. NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE WORK WE'VE DONE CAME OUT OF THE LAST HOUR FIND LAST FALL'S WILDFIRE SEASON AND THE UTILITIES USE OF POWER SHUT US. DELIBERATE ACTION RESULTED IN POWER BEING MORE THAN. EXCUSE ME I JUST LOST MY PLACE- LET ME BEGIN AGAIN. NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE POWER SHUT US AND ABOUT HER SEASON IS THEN EIGHT MONTHS MISTER CHAIR AS YOU HAD MENTIONED SINCE THE GENIE INITIATED THE LARGEST EVER POWER SAFETY OUR SHOP YES YES IN CALIFORNIA. P. GENIES DELIBERATE ACTIONS RESULT IN POWER BEING SHUT OFF TO MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED CUSTOMERS CENTER THOUSAND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. WHICH IMPACTED MORE THAN TWO MILLION PEOPLE AS YOU NOTED MISTER CHAIR AFTER THAT UNDER GATED CATASTROPHE MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS AND COMMIT TO SUCH EVENTS NOT BECOMING THE NEW NORMAL. MY COLLEAGUES RACHEL PETERSON AND CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS WILL SPEAK TO THE DETAILS OF THE VARIOUS MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN SINCE LAST OCTOBER HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THEM QUICKLY. ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH THE COMMISSION OF. NEW MAY THAT WE THE TO BETTER. WITH IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IN ADVANCE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY WELL FIRST SEASON% AND TO MINIMIZE THE DURATION AND IMPACT OF THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS WHEN CALLED. THE CIVIC LIKE WE ARE REQUIRING UTILITIES IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO TO RESTORE POWER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND NO LONGER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE P. S. TS OF THAT. OUR ALSO REQUIRED TO CONVENE REGIONAL ALLIES WORKING GROUP'S WITH TRIBAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS AND TO COURT THANK ADVISORY. PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BUSINESS GROUP GROUPS NON PROFITS AND ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS. THE UTILITIES WILL ALSO CONDUCT PS PS EXERCISES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES INCLUDING CAL FIRE AND CAL YES. THESE GUIDELINES ARE NOW IN EFFECT AND REQUIRE PROGRAMS SUPPORT FOR THE UTILITIES WITHIN TWO MONTHS A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT GIVEN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE CURRENT COLLUDED NINETEEN ENDEMIC. AFTER CALLING IN COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS LAST NOVEMBER TO QUESTION THEIR PERFORMANCE DURING LAST OCTOBER'S PS PS AGAINST WE INITIATED A PROCEEDING TO IMPROVE THEIR RESILIENCY PLANNING. ON MARCH SIX I PROPOSED SEVERAL NEW REQUIREMENTS AMONG THEM A REQUIREMENT ON SITE FOR ON SITE EMERGENCY BACKUP POWER TO SUPPORT ALL ESSENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN SERVICE FOR A MINIMUM. OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A POWER OUTAGE. IN ADDITION PROVIDERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN OUTLINED THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PREPARE FOR A DISASTER AND TO COMMUNICATE CRITICAL. INFORMATION TO EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND TO THE PUBLIC THE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO VOTE ON THIS DECISION IN EARLY JULY. ALSO DUE TO LAST OCTOBER'S PS PS AGAINST OUR MICROGRAMS PROCEEDING WAS RE SCUTTLED LAST DECEMBER TO INCLUDE WILDFIRE RESILIENCY AND WAS FAST TRACKED. ON APRIL TWENTY NINTH A PROPOSED DECISION WAS ISSUE THAT REQUIRES UTILITIES TO FURTHER STANDARDIZE APPLICATIONS AND EXPEDITE PROCESSES FOR PROJECT APPROVALS. ACCELERATE INTERCONNECTIONS OF PROJECTS FOR KEY LOCATION CUSTOMERS AND DISABILITIES. AND JUST TERRACE TO BETTER VALUE RESILIENCY AND ENHANCE COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION WITH LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO BE VOTED ON BY THE COMMISSION JUNE ELEVENTH. LASTLY ON THE SUBJECT I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT ON JANUARY SIXTEENTH WE APPROVED EXPANSION OF THE SELF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM EXT YET YOUR BY DIRECT FUNDING FOR BATTERY BACKUP SYSTEMS WITH A FOCUS ON ACT RESPECTFUL ASIANS AND CRITICAL COMMUNITY FACILITIES. IN AREAS. LIKE TO TALK ABOUT ELECTRICITY RATES AND IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT WE PROJECT WILL INCREASE RATES ON A PASTOR TRAJECTORY THAN IN THE PAST. HISTORICALLY RATE INCREASES HAVE TRACKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION FOR P. JEANNIE AND SEP BUT THE TREND HAS NOT HELD TRUE FOR S. D. G. ET. IN RECENT YEARS SEG ANY RATES ROSE WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER UTILITIES DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING SDG IS A ROBUST INVESTMENT IN WELFARE MITIGATION AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WILDFIRES IN ITS SERVICE TERRITORY. WE EXPECT TO SEE SOMEONE TRENDS WITH ALL THE UTILITIES AS THEYHAVE PROPOSED INVESTING MORE THAN FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN WELFARE MITIGATION EVERS BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OUR CALCULATIONS ESTIMATE THAT FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLARS IN WELFARE MITIGATION SPENDING FIVE P. GINNY FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN EXPECT A 728% INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER BILLS. WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT A NINETY DOLLAR INCREASE IN CUSTOMERS ANNUAL ANNUAL BILLS STARTING TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR S. C. E. IT WOULD BE THE COLOR OF SEVENTY DOLLARS PER YEAR INCREASED AND FOR S. T. G. E. THE EQUIVALENT OF TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS PER YEAR INCREASE. WHILE THEIR MEDICATION COSTS ARE NOT THE ONLY FACTOR HOWEVER THAT WE PROJECTED PUT FORWARD PRESSURE ON. ON CUSTOMER BILLS. THE TAX CODE WITH NINETEEN ARMY ECONOMY AND ON CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL STABILITY IS ALSO LIKELY TO HAVE AN IMPACT. WELL WE ARE STILL EARLY IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OUR ENERGY DIVISION IS WORKING WITH UTILITIES TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL SIZE OF THE IMPACT. WELL RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS ARE USING MORE ENERGY WORKING AND LEARNING FROM HOME THAN BEFORE CO HEAD NINETEENTH OVERALL DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IS DOWN AND UTILITIES ARE NOT COLLECTING THE REVENUE THEY NEED TO COVER THEIR COSTS. EARLY ESTIMATES SHOW THAT THE UTILITIES ARE COLLECTING BETWEEN TEN AND 20% LESS THAN WHAT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY. FORECAST IT. WHEN YOU. AFTER THE COVER THIS UNDER THROUGH RAY SO UNDER COLLECTION INTO TWENTY COULD BE RECOVERED TO INCREASES IN RATES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR UNDER COLLECTIONS DUE TO PAY BILLS WE DO NOT YET HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE POTENTIAL AS OF THE STATE. WE DO HOWEVER HAVE A PROCESS FOR HANDLING YOU ARE GENERAL RATE CASE PROCESS. THE C. P. U. C. COULD REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF THE COSTS OF THE PANDEMIC BY ADVERTISING A COLLECTION OF THESE COSTS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME BUT THESE ACTIONS WILL LIKELY HAVE THE IMPACT OF INCREASING THE UTILITIES THAT. AND THEIR COST TO BORROW MONEY WHICH IN THE END RESULT IN EVEN BIGGER RATE INCREASES. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE CBC'S ROLE IN THE P. GENIES BANKRUPTCY CASE. HOWEVER SINCE ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS PUBLIC I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS VERY BRIEF. PURSUANT TO A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR THE CPUC ADOPTED AND DECISION APPROVING WITH CONDITIONS HE GINNY'S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION LAST THURSDAY MAY TWENTY EIGHT. IN ADOPTING THE DECISION THE CBC'S FOCUS WAS INSURING THAT WHILE FIRE VICTIMS ARE COMPENSATED. THAT THE PLAN IS A RATE PAYER NEW. AND THE P. GENIES CUSTOMERS RECEIVE SAFE. RELIABLE SERVICE AT REASONABLE RATES CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE DECISION THAT ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE DECISION REQUIRES CHANGES IN P. GENIES GOVERNANCE MANDATES REGIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND A LOCAL OPERATING REGION'S. PUTS IN PLACE AN INDEPENDENT MONITOR THE REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE CDC AND PUTS IN PLACE AN ENHANCED OVERSIGHT PROCESS THAT DEFINES ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS TAKEN. INDICATION OF THE P. GENIES AUTHORITY TO OPERATE. IT ALSO MAKES DETERMINATIONS TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS FIVE FUND FINDING THAT P. GINNY'S PLAN OF REORGANIZATION IS RIGHT NEUTRAL ON AVERAGE AND REQUIRES P. GINNY TO HONOR ITS COMMITMENT TO NOT BURDEN RATE PAYERS WAS COST FROM PRE TWENTY NINE. OH HIRES. THE DECISION DOES NOT MARK THE END OF OUR WORK TO PUSH P. GINNY TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN HOW IT PRIORITIZES CUSTOMERS AND SAFETY. WORK WILL BE ON GOING IN OUR SAFETY CULTURE PROCEEDING AND OTHER NEW PROCEEDINGS TO FURTHER DEVELOP SAFETY AND OPERATIONAL MAT MATRIX AMONG OTHERS. WITH MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY AND ALLOW ME TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE JUST A SUBSET OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES THE CDC IS CURRENTLY ADDRESSING. AND OF COURSE I'M TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. I THINK THIS PETERSON IS NEXT ON THE AGENDA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO ASK OKAY SHE'S GONNA PICTURES AND GO AHEAD. I'LL GO AHEAD SENATOR KERRY CAN- TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT. YES SO WE HAVE WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AND PRETTY SURE I KNOW I DO I WANTED TO ASK A- DISPATCHER. IN PARTICULAR RELATED TO THE UTILITIES AND THE FIRES. AND THE SHOT OFFICE- OR OR THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES ESPECIALLY PGA ANY ADEQUATELY PREPARED. FOR THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRE SEASON WHAT- CAN WE EXPECT THIS YEAR. COMPARED TO THE PAST YEARS. MISTER CHAIRMAN- BOTH MISS PETERSON AND HIS TIMES JACOBS HAVE IN THERE- PRESENTATIONS WILL BE MORE WILL CERTAINLY GO THROUGH WHAT THE PS PS- LOOKS LIKE FOR THE THREE UTILITIES RIGHT NOW AS WELL AS ALLOW HER MITIGATION PLAN. SO WE'RE GONNA MAYBE THAT ALL OF YOU CAN MAKE YOUR PRESENTATIONS AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO DO QUESTIONS A SHARE AND MAYBE YOU CAN COVER THAT IN AND YOUR PRESENTATION IT COMES. ALL RIGHT VERY. THANK YOU DR AND THANK YOU CHAIR HUESO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RACHEL PETERSON I'M THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY AT THIS YOU SEE. AND TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS OUR ACTIONS SINCE LAST FALL INTO QUESTIONS OF. IN THIS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY SET US THIS YEAR. EVEN AS WE DISCUSS READY MISS I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT DOWN AT THE DYNAMIC THE CDC IS THE REGULATOR OF THE UTILITIES. WE SET THE RULES AND STANDARDS THAT THEY MUST MEET. ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE THE OPERATORS OF THEIR SYSTEMS THEY KNOW OUR RULES AND STANDARDS AND IT IS UP TO THEM TO ACHIEVE READING THISBEFORE THEY CHOOSE TO CONDUCT THE FIRST P. S. F. LANCE OF TWENTY TWENTY. ACTIVE TERRITORY. IT'S ALL UP TO THE TO MAKE SAFE OPERATE DECISIONS BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THE EVENTS. FIRST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR OVERSIGHT ACTION SO FAR IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS- SINCE FEBRUARY WE HAVE MET WEEKLY IN DETAIL MEETINGS WITH P. JEANNIE IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE PROGRESS UNDER THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. THERE BY REPORTS ARE ON OUR TO SEE IF UC'S WEBSITE FOR ANYONE TO VIEW. WITH CAL FIRE AND CAL- YES WE'VE ALSO HELD A DETAILED BRIEFINGS FROM THE OTHER FIVE ELECTRIC UTILITIES. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SDG AND E. BEAR VALLEY PACIFICORP AND LIBERTY ABOUT THEIR BE AS PRETTY AS **** PREPARATIONS. INCLUDING. HOW THEY ADJUSTED FOR KOBE NINETEEN. I WANT. THE THREE LARGE U. STATE OF READINESS. HE JENNY AS OF TODAY MY OBSERVATION IS THAT P. GENIE IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS READINESS WE HAVE SOME MAJOR IF. THE VERY BIGGEST QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER THE COMPANY CAN BRING ALL OF THEIR LINES OF EFFORT TOGETHER INTO A SMART AND COMPETENT EXT IN THIS YEAR. FIRST I WANT TO TOUCH ON THEIR COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNER OUTREACH NOTIFICATION AND ENGAGEMENT. HE JENNY HAS HELD TWENTY SIX BRIEFING SESSIONS ONLINE WITH COUNTY LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES OUT OF THE FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY. ADDRESSING ELEMENTS OF READING THIS IN EACH COUNTY OUR STAFF HAS MONITORED ALL TWENTY SIX SESSIONS TO DATE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. HE JENY IS THING A PUBLIC SAFETY SPECIALIST IN EACH COUNTY. THIS WAS A HUGE PAIN POINT FOR COUNTIES IN TWENTY NINETEEN BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUALS THEN DEDICATED. COULD NOT MEANING FULLY COMMUNICATE WITH P. GENIES EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO TRAIN THE PUBLIC SAFETY SPECIALIST AS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS ON. HOWEVER THEY ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF BEING HIRED AND SO THEIR TRAINING AND PERFORMANCE IS A SIGNIFICANT IF. WE HAVE PUT YOU NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR USABLE LIST OF CRITICAL FACILITIES AND MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS. THEIR DATA PORTAL JUST BECAME LIVE RECENT WEEKS AFTER SOME TECHNICAL DELAYS. THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH- BECAUSE OF THOSE DELAYS HE JENNY CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE ANY FURTHER TIME. THE COMPANY HAS IMPROVED ITS WEBSITE CAPACITY SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IS CONDUCTING A FINAL WORD VIEW OF THEIR DESIGN AND CAPACITY TOMORROW JUNE FIFTH AND WE WILL BE PART OF THAT REVIEW. AS TO KEEP THE RESOURCES RESOURCE CENTERS HE JENNY IS WORKING ON PARALLEL PLANS FOR HARD DECIDED C. R. C.'S. AS WELL AS OPEN AIR TENDS AND BANDS GIVEN THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF CODE NINETEEN. AND DIFFERENT PHASES OF RE OPENING IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AS OF MAY TWENTY SIX THE COMPANY REPORTED THAT IT HAS FIVE HARD SIDED SITES EVEN READY OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THAT IT IS TARGETING TO COMPLETE. SO CLEARLY THE COMPANY STILL HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE CONTRACTED WITH THIRTY BANDS WHICH COULD PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. IF THEY CALL A P. S. P. S. EVENT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. SECOND I'LL TOUCH ON THEIR GREED IMPROVEMENTS AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. THEY'RE TARGETING INSTALLATION OF FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO SEXUALIZED DEVICES BY SEPTEMBER FIRST. THEY DID FALL BEHIND IN THIS EFFORT AND YET IF THEY CONTINUE TO MEET MONTHLY TARGETS THEY SHOULD HAVE THOSE DEVICES INSTALLED BY SEPTEMBER ONE. THEY'VE CONTRACTED WITH SEVERAL PROVIDERS A BACKUP GENERATION FOR DEPLOYMENT AT SUBSTATIONS AND C. R. C.'S SO THAT TARGETED PROCUREMENT IS COMPLETE. HOWEVER AS OF TODAY NONE OF THE BACK OF UNITS ARE OPERATIONALLY READY. HERRING TO RELIEVE BUT CANNOT LOSE TIME THAT EFFORT. THEY HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR ORIGINAL TARGET OF TWENTY THREE TRANSMISSIONS. WITH TWENTY SEVEN INSTALLED TODAY IF PROPERLY DEPLOYED THOSE SWITCHES SHOULD REDUCE THE SCOPE OF YES YES. SO IN SOME I WOULD OBSERVE AGAIN THAT P. GENIE IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD READY NEST WITH SOME MAJOR IFS AND THE BIGGEST QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER THEY CAN BRING ALL OF THEIR LINES OF EFFORT TOGETHER INTO A SMART AND COMPETENT EXECUTION. I'LL TALK ABOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH LAST WEEK EDISON NOTED THE CPU NOTIFIED THE SEE IF YOU SEE AFTER PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS OTHER POTENTIAL P. S. P. AS A VENDOR ON SATURDAY MAY TWENTY NINTH AFFECTING A POTENTIAL FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CUSTOMERS. I PARTICIPATED IN DAILY THINGS- WITH THE COMPANY AND CAN REPORT THAT THEIR NOTIFICATIONS AND BRIEFINGS TO PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS OCCURRED AT THE REQUIRED CADENCE AND WERE INFORMATIVE THEY IDENTIFIED AND CONFIRMED CONTACT WITH SEVENTEEN MEDICAL FLIGHT CUSTOMERS THEY CONSULTED WITH THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGERS FROM MONO INYO COUNTY. YET THE CASE. THERE CAN RESOURCE VAN. AND THEY USE NEXT FACEBOOK AND THEIR WEBSITE FOR NOTIFICATIONS THAT INCLUDED MESSAGING- INCLUDED MESSAGING ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING. THERE WAS NO DE ENERGIES ASIAN IN THE END OF LAST WEEKEND AND SINCE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A TRIAL EVENT IT ALLOWED US TO OBSERVE THEIR STATE OF READINESS WELL THEY DIDN'T DEMONSTRATE READING AS LAST WEEK WE ARE TRACKING THE COMPANY FOR OVER NOTIFICATIONS WHICH WAS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN THEIR EXECUTION IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WE'RE ALSO IN THE GYM WITH THEM IN DISCUSSIONS ALONG WITH CAL FIRE AND CAL- YES. ABOUT THE COMPANY'S THRESHOLD FOR CALLING A PSP AS EVENT REMEMBERING THE THESE ARE MEANTTO BE ADVANCE OF LAST RESORT. LAUGHTER TURNED AS THE GENIE. THIS COMPANY BECAUSE OF THAT- WILDFIRES STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. HAS THE MOST YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WITH PS PS. AT PRESENT THEIR PLANS AND THEIR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THEIR TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT ALL APPEARS SOLID AND THEY APPEAR READY AGAIN EXECUTIONS WILL BE THE TRUE TEST. WE WILL BE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH SDG IN THE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DECISION MAKING AS WELL ABOUT WHEN TO CALL A PS PS EVENT REMAINS FOCUSED ON USING IT AS A LAST RESORT. AND CONSIDERING ALL OTHER ALTERNATIVES FIRST. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND- EITHER HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR TURN IT TO CAROLINE THOMAS JACOBS THANK YOU. YES REMOTE OVER TO A CAROLINE I'M SORRY TO RICHARD PETERSON. RIGHT YEAH. OKAY SORRY UNTIL THE LINE THOMAS SORRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU DEPUTY DIRECTOR DIRECTOR PEARSON AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CHANCE TO BRIEF YOU ON OUR PROGRESS ESTABLISHING WATER PARKS EACH DIVISION IN OUR MISSION TO DRIVE REDUCTION IN UTILITY RELATED WILDFIRE RISK. BUILDING UPON IS PETERSON'S TESTIMONY AND THE EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO ENSURE UTILITIES MINIMIZE OUR USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AND THE WILD CARDS THE DIVISIONS PURPOSE TO ENSURE UTILITIES DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR RISK OUR PRIMARY VEHICLE TO DRIVE THIS UTILITIES LONG TERM PLANNING IS OUR OVERSIGHT OF THE WATER MITIGATION PLANS. YOU KNOW THAT IF IT IS THE MANDATED A ONE ELEVEN AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND WE ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO PERFORM SEVERAL CORE FUNCTIONS. NEYVELI EVALUATION- FOR AN APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF THE CORPORATIONS. WHILE PERMITTING ASIAN PLANS INSURANCE CLIENTS TO THOSE PLANS. REVIEWING IN ISSUING SUBSEQUENT SAY TO CERTIFICATES. AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER SUPPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES. WE WERE ESTABLISHED AS OF JANUARY ONE OF THIS YEAR. AND TODAY WE HAVE HIRED AN EQUIPPED OUR DIVISION STAFF AND CONTINUE TO RECRUIT FOR THE REMAINING OPEN POSITIONS. WE RELEASED NEW TWENTY TWENTY WHAT FAR MITIGATION PLANNING GUIDELINES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE THE EXPECTATIONS ON THE UTILITIES FOR THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN THE JUSTIFICATION WITHIN THEIR PLANS. ON MAY SEVENTH WE RELEASED OUR DRAFT EVALUATIONS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY PLANS. SUBMITTED BY THE EIGHT INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WE'RE REVIEWING POP. ASIANS WILL BE ISSUING OUR FINAL DETERMINATIONS BY JUNE TENTH. IN ORDER TERMINATION WILL BE PUT BEFORE THE COMMISSION FOR RATIFICATION ON JUNE ELEVENTH. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE MADE SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS TO HOW WE STRUCTURE THE WATER MITIGATION PLAN GUIDELINES THIS YEAR TO DRIVE DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT INCLUDE RISK AND DATA INFORM JUSTIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR THE NEW GUIDELINES WERE TO INCREASE STANDARDIZATION. IMPROVE OBJECTIVITY AND FRAME OF FORWARD LOOKING FOCUS pWHILE APARTMENT MITIGATION. MATURITY MODEL TO DRIVE UTILITIES TO BUILD AN EFFECTIVE RISK REDUCTION CAPABILITIES AND TRACK THE IMPROVEMENT OF THOSE CAPABILITIES OVER TIME. WHEN EVALUATING THE PLANS THAT DIDN'T CONSIDER FOUR FACTORS COMPLETENESS. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY EFFECTIVENESS BUT USE THE RESOURCES AND FORWARD LOOKING GROWTH. THE DIVISION ISSUE DRAFT ACTION STATEMENTS APPROVING THE EIGHT ELECTRICAL CORPORATION PLANS SIX OF THOSE APPROVALS ARE CONDITION ON THE UTILITY RESOLVING A NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THEIR CLASS. BEFORE I GET INTO THE ASSESSMENT ABOUT PLANS I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THE BACK IN MARCH GIVEN THE POPE IN NINETEEN IMPACTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE RECOGNIZE WE COULD NOT LET ONE DISASTER DISTRACT US FROM PREPARING FOR ANOTHER. SPECIFICALLY PREPARED FOR WILDFIRES. ON MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH WEEK ISSUED A JOINT LETTER TO THE UTILITIES ALONG WITH CALLAWAY GAS AND CAL FIRE IN WHICH WE STATE OUR EXPECTATIONS. THAT THE THAT THE UTILITIES CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE A CENTRAL WILDFIRE SEE IF YOU WORK WHILE MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF OUT HIS ON CUSTOMERS. WHO WERE NOW WORKING AND LEARNING FROM HOME. AND WHILE THE DELICATE BALANCE WE'VE ENSURE THE UTILITIES CONTINUE EXECUTING ON THEIR PROJECTS TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK FOR THIS YEAR. AS FOR OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PLANS ALL OF THE TWENTY TWENTY PLANS GIVEN THE NEW GUIDELINES WERE STRONGER THAN THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN PLANTS. AND ARTICULATE A THREE YEAR DIRECTIONALLY FOCUSED STRATEGY TO YOU REDUCE UTILITY RELATED WILDFIRE RISK. WITH THE NEW GUIDELINES EACH OF THE UTILITIES SUBMITTED DATA DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR TOP IGNITION DRIVERS AND ARTICULATE THE MADE MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES. THEY HAVE OR ARE DEVELOPING TO ADDRESS THOSE IGNITION DRIVERS. FOR EXAMPLE P. JEANNIE OUTLINED INITIATIVES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING THEIR TOP TWO IGNITION DRIVERS WHICH ARE CONTACT FROM OBJECT AT 56% AND EQUIPMENT FAILURE AT CONTACT WITH COVERED CONDUCTOR ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS AND A NUMBER OF SYSTEM HARDENING EFFORTS SUCH AS REPLACING POLES PARK AND TARGETED UNDER RUNNING. I LIVE THIS TUESDAY IN THEIR ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM P. JEANNIE REPORTED THEY'VE COMPLETED FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILES OF THEIR PLAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILES FOR CLEARING THE ADDITIONAL TWELVE FOOT RADIUS. THEY'RE ALSO INSTALLING AS MS PETERSON MENTIONED FIVE HUNDRED NINETY TWO SEXUALIZED AND DEVICES AND HAVE- COMPLETED TODAY TWENTY SEVEN TRANSMISSION LINES WHICH IS WHICH WILL LESSEN THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL OUT OF. ON CUSTOMERS. AS FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. THEY ALSO OUTLINED WILD FIRE MITIGATION PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THEIR MAJOR RISK DRIVERS IN THEIR SERVICE ALLOCATED OVER 40% OF THEIR PLAN SPEND TO COVER CONDUCTOR. AND IS DEPLOYING SEVEN HUNDRED CIRCUIT MILES OF CUT IT COVERED CONDUCTOR IN TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE TARGET OF FORTY FIVE HUNDRED CIRCUIT MILES BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO INTO THE THREE YEAR PLAN. HER EYES AND- DUE TO THIS LARGE INVESTMENT WE HAVE ASKED FOR MORE JUSTIFICATION WITHIN ONE OF THEIR DEFICIENCIES. THEY'RE ALSO ADDING FIRE RESIST WRAPS TO PROTECT POLLS. INSTALLING COMPOSITE POLES AND EXPANDING THEIR FUTURE PLACEMENT CENTRALIZATION EFFORTS. SAN DIEGO CONTINUES TO EXPLORE NEW EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING AN LP E. INSTALLING AN LTE COMMUNICATION NETWORK THAT WILL ENABLE AUTOMATIC AND REMOTE CONTROL THEIR GRADING IS ADDING THIRTY MORE SEXUALIZED DEVICES AND TWENTY SEVEN WEATHER STATIONS. AND HAS A NEW SATELLITE BASED HOT SPOT ALERTING CAPABILITY THAT ENABLES QUICK IDENTIFICATION AND RESPONSE TO PUT FIRES OUT BEFORE THEY GET BIG. ALL OF THIS WORK WILL DRIVE DOWN OUR SHARED UTILITY WILDFIRE RISK THERE REMAIN HOWEVER HOWEVER A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF DEFICIENCIES IN THEIR WATER MITIGATION PLANS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE THE PLANS ARE TO KELLY. PRIORITIZED WILDFIRE MITIGATION INVESTMENTS THAT BY DOWN THE MOST REX. COMMON DEFICIENCIES INCLUDED RISK ASSESSMENTS THERE'S A LITTLE DISCUSSION ON HOW THE RISK MODELS ASSESSED CONSEQUENCES OF A GIVEN IGNITION. ALSO EQUIVOCATING LANGUAGE THE ARE YOU OFTEN AVOIDED MAKING QUANTIFIABLE MEASURABLE AND VERIFIABLE COMMITMENTS TO SPECIFIC MISSION IS A SPECIAL OUTCOME METRICS. IN TOTAL WE IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND FIVE EFFICIENCIES ACROSS THE UTILITIES INCLUDING TWENTY NINE PER P. JEANNIE TWENTY TWO FOR CALIFORNIA EDISON AND SIXTEEN FOR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. I ALSO FOUND TWELVE DEFICIENCIES THAT APPLY ACROSS THE UTILITIES. FOR EACH OF THESE DEFICIENCIES WE HAVE PLACED A CONDITION ON THE UTILITY TO RESOLVE THE DEFICIENCY WITHIN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME. BUT THE PLANS ARE JUST ABOUT A PLAN. THE TRUE REDUCTION RISK WILL COME FROM THE EXECUTION OF THESE PLANS WHICH WE WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THROUGH OUR COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES. HE WATER SAFETY DIVISION COMPLIANCE BRANDS HAS AS A BURLY MAY BE GONE PROACTIVE FIELD INSPECTIONS ON WATER MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. WITH A PRIORITY ON SYSTEM HARDENING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND PS PS REDUCTION INSPECTIONS. WE'VE COMPLETED FIVE HUNDRED NINE INSPECTIONS TO DATE. AND ON TRACK TO COMPLETE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND INSPECTIONS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THROUGH THESE INSTRUCTIONS WE FOUND SIXTEEN THE FAX INCLUDING HAZARD TREES WITHIN CONTACT RANGE OF WIRES BUT IF YOU CAN CONTACT ON GUY WIRES AND EXTENSIVE WOODPECKER DAMAGE ON POLLS. WE HAVE NOTIFIED THE UTILITY OF THESE DEFECTS AND WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO RESULTING IN A TIMELY MANNER. INCLUDING THE TWENTY TWENTY WATER MITIGATION PLANS AND THE ASSOCIATED DATA WE REQUIRED WITH THEM ARE A MARKED IMPROVEMENT. OVER LAST YEAR. THE VAST AMOUNT OF DATA PROVIDED BY THE UTILITIES IS ENABLING US TO DIG INTO THE DETAIL AND PUSH THEM. INTO THE DETAILS ON WHY HOW AND WHERE THEY NEED TO FOCUS THEIR TIME AND RESOURCES TO DRIVE REDUCTION IN WALL VIRUS. AS WITH MOST THINGS HOWEVER THE MORE WE HAVE ASKED FOR THE MORE WE FIND THAT WE NEED TO PUSH THE UTILITIES TO ENSURE THEY ARE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND TAKING THE TIME TO STRATEGICALLY THINK THROUGH. HOW BEST TO INVEST THE RESOURCES TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. OUR INTENT GOING FORWARD IS TO PUT CONTINUE TO PUSH THE UTILITIES. TO PROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES. TO UNDERSTAND AND MITIGATE THAT RISK AND BUILD OUR OWN CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE WALLS. OF OUR CITY DIVISION TO ENSURE WE ARE PROP WE CAN PROPERLY ASSESS AND HOLD THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE TO MEETING THEIR COMMITMENTS. TO REDUCING WILD VIRUS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- I HAD QUESTIONS RELATED TO. ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC IN THAT QUESTION WAS ANSWERED ANSWERED I ALSO HAD. BUT THE QUESTION REGARDING TO IMPLEMENTING- THE PROGRAMS UP PRIOR TO THE FIRE SEASON AND YOU ANSWERED THAT AS WELL YOU TO HANDLE A LOT OF US I MEAN. A LOT LOTS OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE RELATED TO THE WILDFIRES AND I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE AND ALL THE ATTENTION YOU PUT TO THIS ISSUE AND- ALSO RELATED TO P. GINNY'S BANKRUPTCY AND- PUTS A- PC WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS NOT SEEMS TO BE COMING TO A CLOSE VERY SOON BUT THERE ARE OTHER. PROGRAMS THAT SERVE COURSE IN THE IN THE- THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS SERVER WE'VE HAD WE'VE SEEN INTERRUPTIONS AND REVIEWING RATE CASES WE'VE SEEN DELAYS. AND REVIEWING- YOU KNOW OTHER PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE EVALUATED- IN THE CPUC NAM TWO POINT NO DECISION THAT HAPPENED A IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT THE COMMISSION NOTED BACK THEN THAT THEY WOULD REVIEW THE ISSUE AGAIN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WE KNOW THE TWENTY NINETY CAME AND WENT AND- THERE WAS NO REVIEW OF THAT ISSUE. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT THE COMMISSION'S PLANS ARE ON ON REVIEWING THE NET AND ENERGY METERING PROGRAM SUCH AS PARTICULAR- YOU DON'T HAVE AN INTEREST IN SUPPORTING- BROADER UP. PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAMS LIKE A THE CARE PROGRAM. AND OF. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT WITHIN THOSE PROGRAMS ARE ARE CERTAIN INEQUITIES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND I JUST WANTED ASK YOUR THOUGHTS IF YOU HAVE THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BEEN CONTEMPLATING AT LEAST FOR THIS YEAR.

IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AT THAT TIME THE COMMISSION STATED ITS INTENTION TO REVISIT THE TERRAPINS YOU JUST STATED MISTER CHAIR AGAIN IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO CONSIDER THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM. TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND THE GRID THE COMMISSION MAKE UP AT THE TIME HAD ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED TWENTY NINETEEN AS A GOOD TIME TO REVISIT THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE THAT WAS WHEN THEY HAD EXPECTED DEFAULT TIME OF USE RATES TWO BILLION IS FOR ALL RESIDENTS UTILITY CUSTOMERS AND HAVING THAT RATE TRANSITION COMPLETED AND UNDERSTOOD WOULD BE VALUABLE FOR THE VISIT IN TERMS OF AND- THEN THE COST BENEFITS AND WOOD ENERGY LESS UNCERTAINTY FOR THE CUSTOMERS. I. ROLL OUT. THEN ON A LONGER SKI LET'S AND TWENTY SIXTY RPG IN AND AS AND SIR CAN HELD OFF ON INITIATING THE NAM REVISIT IN TWENTY NINETEEN DUE TO THE ONGOING DELAY WE ARE CONSIDERING MOVING AHEAD WITH INITIATING THE REVISIT PROCEEDINGS LATER THIS SUMMER. ANYTHING WE WOULD INITIATE THIS SUMMER WOULD LIKELY TAKE UP TO PRESS ME EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO COME TO A CONCLUSION AT WHICH POINT THE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER RATE TRANSITIONS WILL HAVE ALREADY TAKEN PLACE. WHILE NOT IDEAL THE COMMISSION SIMILARLY DEALT WITH SOME GREAT UNCERTAINTY WHEN LOOKING AT THEM IN THE PAST AND IT IS DOABLE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC AND COMMISSION WITH A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE NUMBER PROGRAM WE HIRED A CONSULTANT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO COMPLETE AN EVALUATION OF NAM TWO POINT OH WHICH WILL BE REPLACED. AFTER THE NUMBER TWO POINT OH STUDIES RELEASED WE WILL EXAMINE POTENTIALLY PLACEMENT THEM TERRACE WHICH IN THE NEW WE VISITED PROCEEDINGS. OF THE DELAY WAS DUE TO.

WE HAVE SENATOR HILL ON THE LINE IF WE CAN QUEUE AND- CENTER HILL SO WE CAN ASK US QUESTIONS. EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATED AND- IF YOU COULD WORK WE'RE DOING TODAY TO. THIS HEARING THANK YOU FOR CALLING THAT- INTO- PRESIDENT BOETTCHER AND IN YOUR YOUR STAFF TEAM THANK YOU FOR THE- HARD WORK. ESPECIALLY IN THE ENORMITY OF THE TASK BEFORE YOU TODAY I YOU TO INCREDIBLE SET. TO JUST ENVISIONED THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN THE- THE SCOPE OF IT AND HOW TO USE INCREASING AND ESPECIALLY THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACED WITH SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I HAVE JUST A FEW QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD ONE TWO A PRESIDENT THAT YOU'RE IN AND TO- IS PETERSON- IF YOU WOULD AT YOUR OPTIONS CONCERNED ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL REFORM. AND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG FOCUS OF YOURS PRESIDENT BOETTCHER AND- THERE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IT'S COMMITTEE. OF AND AS YOU. THE INTEREST IN THE- OF SAFETY STAFF AT THE DURING THE COMMISSION INTO COMMISSION ADDITIONAL. TO THE OFFICE OF SAFETY ADVOCATES I SEE THE GREASE OF THE STATE. POLICY DEBATE. WHAT'S THE VISION OF THE STATE POLICY GOOD VISION AND- AND HOW DO YOU SEE ITS ROLE DIFFERING FROM OSA. ADDITIONALLY HOW DO YOU SEE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE S. P. E. N. AS TO BE DIFFERENT- AS IT MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR COMPLIMENTARY COMMENTS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF WORK WE'VE DONE I'M QUITE PROUD OF. THAT WE HAVE TACKLED SO MANY PROCEEDINGS SINCE OCTOBER AND WE'RE COMPLETING MOST OF THEM NOW IN THE TIME FRAME. PRIOR TO THE WELL HIGHER SEASON AND ALL THE WHILE WE WERE DOING BANKRUPTCY. OF P. JEANNIE SO I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS VERY MUCH. THIS CITY POLICY IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT SO WE HAVE- WE HAVE DONE EVERY ORGANIZATION AND A RESTRUCTURING- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY POLICY. WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE I'M GOING TO. TURN TO MISS PETERSON SO SHE CAN DESCRIBE THE VISION OF THE SAFETY POLICY- AND- SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION- SHE JUST GOT HER JOB AND IS A 100% SWING ALL THE WAY OUT OF. MORE SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUOTE. WE APPRECIATE IN WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF OVER THE YEARS ON SAFETY MATTERS AT THE P. C. SO THE SAFETY POLICY DIVISION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THAT ESSENTIAL POLICY ANALYSIS AND ADVISING TO THE COMMISSIONERS. AND TO THE ALE JAY'S AND OTHER HIGH LEVEL DECISION MAKERS AT THE COMMISSION WHAT WE NOTICED IS THAT WELL WE HAVE A VERY STRONG IN FORCE PRO. I'M IS YOU GO WE HAD LACK SOME OF THE OVER ARCHING POLICY VIEW POINTS THAT TIME. SO IN MATTERS SUCH AS THE SAFE TRANSITION OF THE NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TOWARDS ITS CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. MATTERS SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION WHICH ALSO IMPACTS UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS. WE WITHIN ENFORCEMENT POINT OF VIEW WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE A LONGER POLICY BASED ANALYTICAL TYPE OF VIEW. AND THAT WAS WHY THE DIVISION WAS CREATED- NOTED BELIEVE THE FORMER ALL STATE TO GET ADVOCATE STAFF. ARE FOLDED INTO SAFETY POLICY DIVISION AND SO THEY HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT THEIR SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO BEAR ON CASES SUCH AS THE P. JEANNIE BANKRUPTCY- THE P. S. TS WORK THAT I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING. IT DECEMBER AND SO CAL GAS CITY CULTURE PRECEDING INVESTIGATION WE'VE OPENED. NOW TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. WHAT WE NO LONGER HAVE OR WHAT WE MIGHT. WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE UP FOR WITH THE DISSOLUTION OF THE OFFICES SAFETY ADVOCATES I DO THINK THAT THEY PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE N ADVOCACY IN CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS AND MY INTENTION SINCE I HAVE BOTH ENFORCEMENT AND POLICY UNDER ME. IT'S TO BUILD UP THE ADVOCACY PORTION WITHIN SCTV SO THAT THEY CAN- ADDRESS SAFETY CULTURE AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER TOPICS THAT ALWAYS SAY FORMERLY ADDRESSED. AND IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN THE- A DISTINCTION BETWEEN ADVISORY AND THE TORY STAFF IN IN IN SOME OF THIS HAVE YOU NOTICED OR IS THAT PART OF THE PLAN GOING FORWARD TO- IN IS THERE GOING TO BE A CONTINUED FIRE WALL BETWEEN THEM. YES THERE IS A VERY CLEAR FIRE WALL IN PART BECAUSE COMMON LAW IN CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES DOWN THE SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS THAT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE- AND REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW SO THERE IS A VERY CLEAR DISTINCTION OF FUNCTION YES. THANK YOU AND ONE QUESTION DO IT CAROLINE PALMISTRY IF I COULD- I'M CURIOUS WHO IS OVERSEEING THE TRANSITION AS WE KNOW FROM THE WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO. HELP OUR ALONG ARE YOU IN ENSURING THAT THE TRANSITION WILL BE MUCH HAPPENED HOPEFULLY SEAMLESSLY BUT BEFORE A JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR SO I WOULD SAY WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT TRANSITION FROM THE MOMENT WE STOOD UP THE DIVISION. SO HOW FAR ALONG ARE I WOULD SAY BROKEN UP INTO IT WAS ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TIMELINE WHEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE TRANSITION BY JULY ONE OF NEXT YEAR. SO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WE'VE TAKEN ON AS ON BUILDING THE DIVISION WHICH WHEN I BILL THE DIVISION I LOOK AT IT AND THREE. MILLION TRUNCHEONS PEOPLE PROCESS SEASON AND TECHNOLOGY YOUR TOOLS THAT WE NEED. SO AS WE'RE BUILDING EACH OF THOSE. EVERYTHING I'M DOING LOOKING TOWARD WITH AN EYE TOWARDS OKAY HOW DO I GET UP AND RUNNING TODAY COM ARMY. BUT ALSO I WOULD LOOK LIKE. TO RESEARCH. IT. WHAT WE'RE THAT IS OKAY WITH ME IGHT THEY CAN GETCOME STRAIGHT OR IS AN EQUIVALENT OVER THERE CONTROL OF A PROP OR AND THEN IF THERE'S NOT SOMETHING OVER THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING IN TO BUILD WITH RESOURCES TO FILL THAT GAP SO ALL OF THIS IS BEGUN FROM DAY ONE THE TWELVE MONTHS FOR ME IS ABOUT. IN THE FIRST TEST OF THIS YEAR IT'S ABOUT BUILDING A DECENT PLAN- SO THAT THAT ACTUALLY THAT PLAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR THE TREND. BY THE JULY WILL TWENTY TWO ONE. COME STARTED WITH NATURAL RESOURCES AS WELL FROM DAY ONE- I WAS BROUGHT ON AT THE VERY END OF OCTOBER AND WE HAD MEETINGS WITH NATURAL RESOURCES AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. AND WE'VE NOW IT'S ESTABLISHED. YOU ARE MEETINGS WITH RESOURCES TO START ANSWERING ALL OF THOSE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS SO THAT WE CAN BE. FULLY TRANSFER BY JULY ONE NEXT YEAR. WELL THAT'S THAT'S EXCITING AND- IN IN VERY COMPLIMENTARY I THINK IN TERMS OF THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE THE TERM. TRANSITION ND BEING REALLY ON SCHEDULE I THINK TO. GETTING THERE BY THAT TIME SO THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT UPDATE ONE FINAL QUESTION THE PRESIDENT BETTER- HE THE H. YOU KNOW WITH THEIR PERMISSION CARE IF I COULD ON PAGE FORTY SEVEN OF YOUR ANNUAL REPORT. THIS IT THE CPUC NOTES IN IN ITS ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND KEY STATISTICS IN THAT PART OF THE REPORT. UNDER THE ITEM NATURAL GAS PIPELINE INSPECTIONS- THE TO TWENTY NINETEEN TOTAL IS ZERO- KIND OF A BIGDAY- CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT NUMBER PLEASE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THERE WERE NO INSPECTIONS OR- BY IS THERE A COMPLETE LACK OF. ANY LISTED IN THIS. I MEAN IT TURNED OUT MY COLLEAGUE I KNOW FAMILIAR WITH THAT STATISTIC AND I DON'T HAVE THE REPORT I APOLOGIZE. PAGE FORTY SEVEN IN FRONT OF ME THEY TURN TO EITHER- AT YEAH I WOULD HAVE TO APOLOGIZE AS WELL SENATOR I CAN CERTAINLY- CONTACT PEOPLE-GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IT AND I PO FOR CANNIBAL LINE STARTING WITH THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS I AND OUR INTENT AND- BUT I KNOW- IN THE REPORT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT IT EVERY YEAR BEFORE THE- THE- THE HERE. GOING TO GO OVER THAT IN THIS KIND OF STUCK OUT IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMED QUITE UNUSUAL SO IF YOU COULD GET BACK ON THE ENDS AND THE COMMITTEE WITH THAT THAT BE HELPFUL THANK YOU. YES WE WILL IMMEDIATELY GET BACK TO THANK YOU FOR THIS FOR THE QUESTION I'M SORRY. EVENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT ON A PROBLEM THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION THE QUESTIONS ARE. AND I WILL GO TO DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- AGAIN A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE COULD YOU I THINK THIS BY FOR THE PRESIDENT. WHAT IS THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS BEEN TO HARDEN OUR- INFRASTRUCTURE. WELL AS I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST AN ESTIMATION IS. FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLAR OF WELFARE MITIGATION IT IS EQUIVALENT TO A- CENTER EACH INCREASE I BELIEVE IT'S BETWEEN SEVEN AND THAT'S AN ESTIMATED COST- AS I MENTIONED IN MY EARLIER REMARKS AND WHAT THE EQUIVALENT OF THAT WOULD BE ON THE ANNUAL BILL FOR P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS WELL. ANDERSON AND SAN DIEGO AFTER A MINUTE TURN AND SEE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ABOUT THE WIDE WHILE PLAYING MITIGATION EFFORTS AND WHAT IMPACT. THANK YOU PRESIDENT BADGER YEAH- THE PRESIDENT BADGERS ESTIMATES ON. THE IMPACT ON RATES FOR EVERY BILLION DOLLARS- SPENT- IS AT THIS POINT WE FIND THE BEST WAY TO LOOK AT THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE WALL FOR MANY. IMPLANTS FOR THEIR MOM WALTER MITIGATION PLANS WERE FILED TWENTY TWENTY USING P. JEANNIE JUST AS THE EXAMPLE- THERE TWENTY TWENTY WILD FOR MITIGATION PLANTS CONTEMPLATE. PROXIMITY NINE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT THREE YEARS- AND ALSO TO RAISE IN THOSE FIRST THREE YEARS- MY SMALLER NUMBER. THAT 7% HE GETS. ACT OUT THERE AND THEN THE PREVIOUS FALL FOR ME. FOR P. ANY WE'RE ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER A SIMILAR TIME. UTILITIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY. YEAH ON OUT HEALTHCARE BUT OF. STATE ON THIS AND- LAWLER LEVEL MAGNITUDE AND THEN SAVE YOUR GAS ELECTRIC AND A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER OF THIS LEVEL OF MAGNITUDE GOING FORWARD- BUT THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF WILD FOR MITIGATION EFFORTS INVESTMENT THEY'VE MADE OVER THE YEARS AND THERE ARE READY YOU SLICE IT IN THERE RIGHT AND IT'S PRESIDENT TRUMAN. YOU SEEN. THE KILLINGS RACE TRACK AND PLACE FAIRLY. UNTIL STARTING OUT A FEW YEARS AGO WERE SAN DIEGO'S RATES IT START THE TRACK ABOUT PLAYSTATION FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY- IN WE NOW FORECAST FOR THE UTILITIES THAT THEIR RATE. PLACE IN IS ESSENTIALLY NOT EXT BUT SCARY LARGELY BY THE INVESTMENTS FALTERED IT SHOULD. SO I UNDERSTAND SO THAT I WOULD TAKE THEM TO DO THE MATH AND IF IT WAS NINE BILLION SPREAD OUT OVER TIME I WOULD EQUATE THAT TO SEVEN TO EIGHT SECONDS FOR EACH BILLION. THAT WHAT I HEARD. THAT'S CORRECT YEAH- I MEAN IT I LOOKING AT SOME RATE FORECAST THAT WE HAVE NOW AND AGAIN- WE WOULD HAVE TO BREAK OUT- SOME OTHER ELEMENTS THAT ARE DRIVING IT BUT A LARGE ELEMENT DRIVING THAT RIGHT NOW. IS IF YOU WERE TO LOOK P. GENIES RIPS ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT BILLS ARE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD BILLS- THIS YEAR- THEY STARTED OUT THE YEAR. APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWO DOLLARS MONTHS- BUT AS WE LOOK AT THE TREND OVER THE NEXT- THREE YEARS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AT THE END OF THE YEAR THEY WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS- AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD BILL THAT'S AN INCREASE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS PER YEAR PER CUSTOMER- IS WORTH NOTING THAT ACTUALLY- THIS IS THAT. THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN RATES FOR CASTING FOR P. JEANNIE AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TIME. THAT GOES BACK DOWN BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO FROM THE P. JEANNIE STANDPOINT YOU ACTUALLY SEE THOSE CUSTOMERS SEEN A HIGHER PER MONTHLY BILL INCREASED. AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AGAIN NOT EXCLUSIVELY BUT LARGELY DRIVEN. OUR OFFICE. THANK YOU SO LIKE I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS ONE I THINK THIS ONE'S FOR RACHEL FROM. TO HONOR THE SAFETY PART OF IT. WHO'S ACTUALLY TRACKING IN GIVING US- OF GOING OUT ON THE GROUND IN ACTUALLY SEEING. WHAT THE PROGRESSES SO THAT WE KNOW THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING DONE I KNOW LAST YEAR- BEFORE THE P. S. P.'S THERE WAS. NO SO MUCH WORK IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE IT WASN'T MEETING THE TIME FRAMES A TO GET DONE SO WHO'S TRACKING THAT AND- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS CAN'T. GET A REPORT LIKE EVERY MAYBE SIX MONTHS OR OR SO OFTEN. SO ACTUALLY THE BEST PERSON TO ANSWER THAT IS CAROLINE BECAUSE HER DIVISION IS ON THE GROUND. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR SO- WITHIN THIS ONE OF OUR SAFETY DIVISION WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE TO ALL THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE WATER MITIGATION PLANS. WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF. AND YES YES- OBLIGATIONS AS WELL SO TO DATE WE'VE UP OUR COMPLIANCE BRANCH I'VE GOT HALF OF THE STAFF THE FIRE ON MY STAFF WE ALSO HAVE A CONTRACT THAT'S BEEN EXECUTED AUGMENTS THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE COVERAGE. TODAY WE'VE COMPLETED FIVE HUNDRED WE STARTED FIELD INSPECTIONS WE GOT THE TEAM OF THE STAFF AND EQUIPPED- OUT IN THE FIELD BY EARLY MAY SO IN THE FIRST FOUR WEEKS- WE DON'T I WONDER NINE INSPECTIONS AND THEIR INSPECTION ACTIVITIES WE AVERAGE ABOUT. AN INSPECTION ACTIVITIES HEARD IT IN ACTION DAY THAT WERE OUT THERE ONCE WE HAVE THE CONTRACTOR FULLY ONBOARDING THEY SORT OF INSPECTION LAST WEEK- AND THEIR FULL RANGE. OF WE- HAVE TO THOUSAND ACTIONS DONE BY THE END OF THIS YEAR ASSURING EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST ASK. THAT THE UTILITIES ARE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY SAID DO YOU PLAN. THE NEW. GUY I. IS THAT THEY TO PROVIDE AT THE DATA TO SHOW WHAT THEY'D DONE IN WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING ON DOING SO THAT WE THEN SURE THERE ARE DOING WITH THE PLAN DO AND SO THEY WERE TO DO BASED ON DATA WELL. PERFECT THANK YOU SO MY LAST QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS IS FOR. BUT TO A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE PASSED A- THE BILL THIS IS IT FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS I KNOW THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON WILDFIRE BUT- IT TIES TOGETHER SO- WE HAVE. WE HAD A BILL AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHICH EXTENDED THE CAST OF FUNDS- FOR UNDERSERVED AREAS FOR- TELUGU FOR BROADBAND. AND I KNOW THAT IT TOOK AWHILE FOR THE FUNDS TO BE GATHERED AND- LIKE TO KNOW. FOR MY DISTRICT WHERE IT'S VERY RULE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO SERVICE. OR VERY LITTLE SERVICE- WE AND NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- LEARNING FROM HOME- THE THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE VERY MUCH DISADVANTAGED IN THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR SCHOOLS- BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO HOW MANY GRANT APPLICATIONS I KNOW FRONT TEAR IN MY DISTRICT HAS APPLIED FOR A GRANT BUT COULD YOU TELL ME. HOW MANY GRANTS HAVE BEEN APPLIED FOR AND WHAT THE PROGRESS IS MOVING TO GET. THE INFRASTRUCTURE PUT IN PLACE SO OUR HOSPITALS ARE LIBRARIES IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE ROLE AREAS- CAN GET SERVICE SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY LEARN AND UNDER COVE IT- THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO. KICK COMMUNICATED BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. THANK YOU CENTER IF I'M GONNA ASK ROB US FOR WHO IS OUR DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR QUESTION SO THE CALIFORNIA MAN SERVICES FUND- AS YOU SAID UNDER AB SIXTY SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL MONEY ADDED TO IT. AND IT EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR- WOULD DEPLOYING BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE 298% OF THE CONSORTIUM REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE- AT BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AS OF- MAY WE HAVE A NEW APPLICATION WINDOW COMING AND I WERE WE THE FIFTY FOUR. OCCASIONS OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FUND ITSELF HAS RIGHT NOW ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION LEFT TO ALLOCATE TO GRANTS- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THOSE- GRANT APPLICATIONS- AND WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. INCORPORATE OF THE FEDERAL STATE THERE'S DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY FIND WHICH IS A- FCC. REVERSE REVERSE AUCTION WILL BE COMING ONLINE IN OCTOBER THIS YEAR. SO WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS NOW OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OF THOSE FIFTY FOUR APPLICATIONS HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE- ELIGIBLE LOCATIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL PROBE AND HOW CAN WE INCENTIVIZE OUR- APPLICANTS TO APPLY FOR THOSE THOSE MONEY. WAIT TO SCHOOL ACCESS MOST SCHOOLS HAVE RATED TO- HIGH SPEED INTERNET THE SPEED OF NO GIGABIT SPEEDS THERE ARE STILL SOME SCHOOLS THAT DO NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND FIGURING OUT WHERE THOSE SCHOOLS ARE AND FIGURING OUT. HARD TO ACCESS YOU KNOW HOW TO CLOSE THAT GAP- SPECIFICALLY- WITH AS PRESENT ACTUALLY MENTIONED THE CALIFORNIA TELEKINETIC FUND WE PROVIDED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO OFFER HOT SPOT FUNDING TO THE HOT SPOT DEVICES TO SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. THROUGH THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR AND POSSIBLE THROUGH THE END OF SUMMER- THAT MONEY IS LIMITED BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND THESE HOT SPOTS FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME- IT'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY TO. HAVE EVERY YEAR TO SPEND- BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO TRANSFER IS THAT MONEY FURTHER. THROUGH ADICIONAL- OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER SCHOOLS NOT JUST RURAL AND SMALL BUT ALSO MID SIZE AND URBAN. BUT THAT IS ALL GENERAL- PRETTY RECENT BECAUSE OF THE KOBE CRISIS- BUT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE. AVAILABLE TO AS MANY SCHOOLS AS POSSIBLE. THE SO ONE SORRY HAVE ONE FONT THEN HOW HOW WE TO. HOW DO YOU KNOW TO APPLY FOR THAT HOT SPOT. DID YOU NOTIFY SCHOOLS HOW HOW DID YOU DO IT. YES SO WE PARTNER WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THEY DID OUT REACH WITH ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA AND BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY WE CAN'T PROVIDE HOT SPOTS FOR EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE GIVE AND WE ONLY HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- BUT WE DIDN'T AS THE HEALTH OF ALL THE MAJOR. SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEY HAVE OFFERED. UNDER THAT PROGRAM. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS WORKED WITH US TO FIGURE OUT WHICH SCHOOLS ARE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE GIVEN THAT LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY. BUT BASICALLY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS BEEN TAKING THE LEAD ON- COORDINATING AND GETTING OUT THE NOTICE UP TO SCHOOLS. OKAY TAKE YOU WANT ONE SORRY MISTER CHAIR BUT- DIGITAL TO NINETY NINE WHICH WAS A BILL THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOOD AND I DID A COUPLE YEARS BACK. AND IT WAS- SUPPOSED TO BE THE CONTRACT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LET IN I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING UP ON THAT HAPPENS A LOT OF MOVEMENT I KNOW THAT THERE WAS COMMUNITIES ALONG THE WAY. THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CONNECTED MAINLY IN HIS DISTRICT BUT IT DID DID STARTED MY DISTRICT COULD YOU GIVE ME AN. UPDATE ON A DIGITAL TO NINETY AS WELL. YES SIR. CENTER DIGITAL TO AND APPLY FOR CAL. BASS SERVICES GRANT FUNDING WE DID. THAT PRIVATE HOW. SINCE THE TWO THAT WE- THAT BACK IN TWENTY. THEY SAID HAVE SINCE COME BACK FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY- I BELIEVE MORE THAN 50% MORE AND- THAT WAS DRIVEN MAINLY. BY THE FACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS CALTRANS RIGHT AWAY THAT WERE ORIGINALLY PLANNED. STATE HAD TO REDESIGN THE ROUTE WHICH IS. FAIRLY CLOSE TRACKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY TO NINETY NINE CORRIDOR. BUT IT BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT- THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH A WHOLE SEPARATE PROCESS. THE COMMISSION RIGHT NOW HAS THAT APPLICATION FOR IT. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THAT SO. I EXPECT THAT WE SHOULD BE- TAKING ACTION ON THAT WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND. SENATE ALL THE I INTRODUCED A BILL THAT WOULD ASSN TO- COMMUNICATIONS TO PROVIDE A- OF AFFORDABLE OR OR- GREATLY REDUCED BROADBAND SERVICE TO FAMILIES LOW INCOME FAMILIES DURING THE COVERT PANDEMIC ONLY. SO THAT IT'S AN URGENCY BILL AND HOPEFULLY YOU'LL SUPPORT IT'LL IT'LL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM OF GETTING. A BROADBAND TO THE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL SO I JUST WANTED TO. LET YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ALSO IN THE WORKS AND THAT'S IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTIONS. WE'LL GO NOW TO SENATOR RUBIO CENTER. THANK YOU HAVE FIRST TIME I WON ALL FULL COMMAND TO EVERYONE HERE TODAY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO. OF COURSE MAKING THINGS BETTER BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE I THERE'S A LOT OF COMFORT IN TERMS OF ALL THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE. BUT I ALSO HAVE SOME EXTREME CONCERNS. AND DIE GIVEN THAT WERE INTRIGUING WILDFIRE SEASON. AND WE KNOW IN PARTICULAR THIS YEAR IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE. I KNOW FAMILIES ARE BUYING WAY MORE FOOD THAN THEY NORMALLY DO SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT AS MUCH. AND OTHERS A COMMENT MADE- HERE TODAY THAT STATED P. GENIE IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. BUT I ALSO KNOW IT WAS STRONG HIGHLIGHTED HOW MANY IF THEY WERE IN THIS SITUATION. AS A PERTAINS TO MAYBE NOT WORKING. SO I WANT TO KNOW WE ALL OF A BACK UP PLAN THE BACKUP PLAN. JUST IN CASE IT DOESN'T WORK OUT AS A PERTAINS TO THE LOSS OF FOOD FOR FAMILIES OR WONDERFUL. INDIVIDUALS HOW ARE WE HOLDING P. JEANNIE ACCOUNTABLE. IN CASE THINGS DON'T WORK. SURE THANK YOU. FOR THE QUEST THIS REGIONAL. AGAIN BUT DO. P. S. P. AT THE BACK AS A LAST RESORT PARDON ME. AND THAT THEY CONSIDER AND JUSTIFIABLE OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE USED INSTEAD- AS TO THE QUESTION OF. A BACK UP PLAN TO THE BACK UP PLAN. I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT OUR EFFORTS ARE TO INSURE THAT THE UTILITY IS READY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. I DO KNOW THAT THE COMPANY IS CONSIDERING- THINGS LIKE COMPENSATION TO PEOPLE FOR LOST FOOD AND OTHER ON BOXES DURING A PS YES AGAINST- I WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT QUESTION TO THEM- AND IN THEIR PANEL- IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM THEM ON THAT. AS WELL. HE. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANOTHER CLOSE TO CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT MISTER CHAIR PRECEDED AND WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THE CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY- IN IT SO CRITICAL AS WE ENTER THIS FIRE SEASON POTENTIAL FIRE- POWER SHUT OFF SEASON AS WELL AS MISTER CHAR THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THIS ON THE FIRST QUESTION WILL BE DIRECTED TO IT THROUGH THE CHAIR OBVIOUSLY TO PRESIDENT PATTERN GOOD MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT APPRECIATE YOUR WORK IN YOUR TEENS WORK FAT AND I WANNA. GO OFF OF WHAT CENTER RUBIO WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT AND THAT IS THE ISSUE AND THE WORD OF IF SO LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU ARE ON THE FRONT LINES P. GENIES GONNA COME IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THE 33% TARGET BUT I WANNA GET YOUR TAKE ON IS THAT TRUE YOU IT OR 30% TARGET WILL OPT FOR THE YEAR AND THEN HAVE A QUICK FOLLOW UP MADAM PRESIDENT. HIS WIRED FOR I THINK I WOULD ECHO WHAT MY- THINGS. HAS PRESENT ALREADY. I THAT JEANNIE IS. AHEAD OF WHERE THEY WERE IN TWENTY NINETEEN OR THE SPRING OF TWENTY NINETEEN PRIOR TO MY COMING ON BOARD. IN TERMS OF THE LESSONS LEARNED WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO HARDEN THEIR SYSTEM AND BE BETTER PREPARED COMMUNICATING WITH THE- LOCAL- GOVERNMENTS AND THE COUNTIES AND THE CITY SO FAR. HOWEVER AS MY COLLEAGUES STATED- AND YOU YOU MENTIONED GOT IT SENATORS THAT YEAH. THIS IS ABOUT EXECUTION. HAND THEY BETWEEN NOW AND IMMEDIATELY. AS WE ARE IN WHILE FIRES CAN MAKE WELFARE SEASON NOW CAN NAY COMPLETE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED BY. MS PETERSON. AND CAN THEY REALLY DRAW ALL THESE LINES TOGETHER AND PROPERLY EXECUTE. I DON'T KNOW- WE HAVE PUSH THEM VERY HARD- WE'VE BEEN NEEDING EIGHT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE EMERGENCY MEETING I HAD LAST FALL AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE DID TO FOLLOW UP FROM THAT EMERGENCY MEETING. I WASN'T HAPPY IN JANUARY AT ALL WHAT PROGRESS THEY WERE MAKING OR BETTER NOT NOT MAKING SO I DEPLOYED IF YOU WILL- BOTH CAROLINE AND RACHEL AND A COUPLE OF OUR OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES TO MEET WITH THEM LITERALLY DAYS WITH LITERALLY WEEKLY. AND NOT JUST LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO OR WHAT THEY SAID THEY PLANNED ON WE LITERALLY WERE MEETING WITH THEM TO FIND OUT SHOW US WHEN IS IT HOW IS IT WHAT IS THE DATE IF WE DIDN'T THINK THE DATE WAS OF APPROPRIATE IN OTHER WORDS IT WASN'T GONNA GET COMPLETED BEFORE I'LL SEASON WELL LAST SEASON. THEN WE ALTER THE DATE WITH THEM. SO I THINK WE HAVE. PUSH HARD. BUT WE CAN EXECUTE FOR THEM I CAN'T OPERATE THEIR SYSTEM FOR WE CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND WE WILL. BUT WE HAVE TRIED VERY HARD TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IF YOU WILL DURING THE PREPARATION PERIOD AND- SUBMIT A PRESS AND I WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT THEY SAY TO YOU THIS AFTERNOON IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY THINK THEIR- THEIR PREPARATION IS. SO WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT A PRESIDENT YOU'RE SKEPTICAL. I DON'T KNOW THAT I USE THE WORD SKEPTICAL SENATOR. AND I AND. I'M OPTIMISTIC BUT THE OPTIMISM IS INFORMED. BY SOME SIR. AND I AM EXTREMELY HOPEFUL AND I FEEL LIKE THE PC HAS. HAS ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AT THE RIGHT TIME OF THE RIGHT PEOPLE. BUT MY OBSERVATION IN GOING TO THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS OF P. GINNY IS. MANAGEMENT OF THE OF THE COMPANY IS SOMEWHAT. CONCERNING TO ME AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT THINGS THAT ARE AT THE TOP OF THAT COMPANY SOMEHOW DON'T ALWAYS GET TO THE Z. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION. PEOPLE IT IS THAT HEARD THAT THERE IS SORT OF A FROZEN MIDDLE IF YOU WILL OF P. JEANNIE- SO I'M HOPING THAT ALL THAT WE HAVE DONE ALL THAT YOU ALL HAVE DONE THE PUBLIC NOTICE OF HOW POORLY THEY DID- WITH PSP AS THE LIVES THAT WERE IN DANGER BY WELFARE AS WELL AS PS YES THEY HAVE HEARD AND THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT THE EXPECTATION IS HIGH. YOU DEVON A PRESIDENT I'M GOING TO THROUGH TWO C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; IN SICK AT&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOURSELF. MISS PETERSON AND THEN I'LL CONCLUDE. FIRST OF ALL STATEMENT MISTER MISS PETERSON YOU SAID THAT IT IS A LAST RESORT. BUT TO BE ABLE TO USE THESE POWER SHUT OFFS CANDIDLY THERE IS NO OTHER TOOL. BUT THEY HAD LAST YEAR BECAUSE THEY'RE SO FAR BEHIND WHETHER IT'S ACTUALIZATION VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OF. TEMPORARY MARKER WOODS GRADES NO OTHER TOOL TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT WAS USE WITH BLUNT FORCE. SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR- BELIEF ON. THOSE FORTY ODD THE HARDEST HIT SAID STATIONS THAT YOU WOULD SAID THAT THOSE GENERATORS WERE NOT HOOKED UP THEY'RE NOT PREPARED. CAN YOU GIVE THIS A GO LIVE DATE WHAT YOU BELIEVE- EACH YOU'RE GONNA SEE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO. BE ABLE TO GET THOSE TEMPORARY MARKER RATES UP AND RUNNING. AT FROM THE IN IN PRESS ABOUT YOUR ABOUT YOUR- CAN. FOR THIS YEAR. AND IN FINALLY ON THIS YEAR THE COMMUTER RESOURCE CENTERS. SO HOW WAS YOUR DISCUSSION CHANGE IN THIS AREA OF THE CORONA VIRUS- AND ARE YOU ARE THESE HUNDRED AND TWELVE- CENTERS FRIDAY NEEDED PRIOR TO THE VIRUS OR WAS SOCIAL DISTANCING. DO YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE IF YOU DON'T MIND IT KNOWS IN OF CONCLUDING TURNED BACK TO THE CHAIR. ALRIGHT SENATOR- ALL START WITH THE SUBSTATIONS AND- TESTING AND COMMISSIONING RELEASING. RIGHT NOW THE COMPANY'S PLAN IS TO- TESTING RELEASED ALL OF THE BACK OF GENERATION AT THE GVEN SUBSTATIONS- SIMILAR TO WHAT PRESIDENT BADGER SAID NOT ONLY HAVE ARE WE MEETING WITH SYSTEM PRACTICALLY MORE THAN WEEKLY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE REST OF TWENTY TWENTY I BELIEVE. AND SO WE ARE ASKING EVERY BE NEARLY EVERY WEEK OR EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY. WHERE THEIR PROGRESS IS ON- HOOKING UP THOSE SYSTEMS. SO I KNOW THAT A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE ALREADY STAGED AT SUBSTATIONS IT'S A MATTER OF ALSO HOOKING THEM UP AND TEST CURRENT. COMMISSION TO THE UTILITY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO. DO WITH MORE INFORMATION MY QUESTION ONE BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU WAS YOU DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HIT THAT ARE THEY- BELIEVE THAT THAT'S CAN BE OF. ANY BY THE TIME THEY NEED IT. NEXT BUS IS OFTEN ON THAT POINT YES SENATOR OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN YOU ABOUT C. R. C.'S. THEY DID EXPERIENCE SOME DELAYS BECAUSE OF KOBE IN NINETEEN TO SET UP A HARD SIDED C. R. C. THAT IS COMPLY WITH ALL LOCAL PERMITTING AN EIGHTY YEAR REQUIREMENTS REQUIRES MORE IN PERSON CONTACT AND WHAT'S POSSIBLE UNDER THE STAY AT HOME ORDERS SO FOR THAT REASON. BE HARD SIDED- SITES ARE DEFINITELY WELL BEHIND THEY DID THEY HAVE SET UP A PARALLEL PLAN AND DO HAVE A CONTRACT TO MOVE- MOBILE VANS THROUGHOUT THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. WHICH IS WHAT I MENTIONED ALREADY- SO I THINK MY- HOPE WOULD BE THAT THIS YEAR WE THAT WE SEE THEM USING. AND COMPETENTLY EXECUTING A COMBINATION OF BOTH FURTHER PROGRESS ON THE HARD SIDED SITES PLUS THE- MOBILE UNITS. THANK YOU IN SERBO DO YOU BELIEVE THE HUNDRED AND TWELVE IS WHAT THEY NEED TO WITH THE VIRUS AND SOCIAL DISTANCE SENIOR DO YOU BELIEVE THEY NEED NOW THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO SOCIAL DISTANCING. SO THE DR LAST THURSDAY REQUIRES THEM TO SUBMIT A C. OR C. PLAN WITHIN SIXTY DAYS SINCE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN IN PROGRESS ALL THREE THE UTILITIES ON WORKING ON C. R. C.'S I EXPECT TO SEE IN THEIR PLAN A DETERMINATION OF WHERE THEY THINK THAT THOSE- HUNDRED AND TWELVE LOCATIONS SHOULD BE- LOCATED FOR THE REPETITION- BUT IN ADDITION THEY ARE THERE OUR GUIDELINES STATE THAT THEY ARE MEANT TO CONSULT WITH COUNTY'S EMERGENCY JERKS. AT LOCAL TRAVELING REMAINS ON THE LOCATIONS OF THIS YOUR SEATS SO IT'S NOT OUR DETERMINATION IT'S THE UTILITY WORKING WITH LOCALS TO DECIDE WHICH ARE THE BEST SPOTS WHERE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT EGRESS ROUTES WHAT TYPE OF- SEER SKI SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WE SET THE GUIDELINES TO BE FAT IN CONSULTATION AND WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTING TURNED BACK TO THE CHAIR MY I GUESS MY MAYBE NOT COMING THROUGH CLEARLY. WITH WHAT THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN WITH THE COMMISSION I GET IT THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY IS DIRECTLY BUT IN THIS ERA OF CORONAVIRUS. YOU HAVE TO BE A LOOK AT NEW NUMBERS IS FOR DOING TRANSFER. OUR CLASSROOMS SCHOOLS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO I ASSUME WITH COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS BECAUSE WE CAN'T PUT AS MANY PEOPLE INTO ONE CENTER AS WHAT WAS ONCE THOUGHT WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING SIX FEET. SO MY QUESTION WAS IS THAT I KNOW FOR THIS NEW ERA THAT WE LIVE IN OR DO YOU BELIEVE IT DOES THE COMMISSION BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AN EXPANDED FOOTPRINT FOR THE SEARS SEES. BASED OFF THE SIX FOOT SOCIAL DISTANCING IN ART THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INTELLIGENCE RESEARCHER. THE. NOW GO TO SENATOR MORE LEVEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. PRESIDENT BADGER GOT WELCOME POSITION I- HAVE A COPY OF THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR TWENTY NINETEEN WHICH WAS PROVIDED TO ALL OF US ON OUR DESKS WITHOUT. I UNDERSTAND IT. YOU DON'T HAVE A COPY BEFORE YOU. SO I JUST SOME SOME PARTS OF FROM MY EXPERIENCE. OF BACK. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX YEARS AGO THE COUNTY OF ORANGE FILED FOR CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY AND- AS A RESULT THAT WE MADE A LOT OF CHANGES TO HOW WE REPORTED OF FOR EVERY DEPARTMENT AND IN ONE OF THOSE PROCEDURES WAS CALLED A- RESULTS ORIENTED GOVERNMENT R. O. G. AND SO THE REPORT. DOT BE A BUSINESS PLAN IT WOULD INCLUDE. WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHED THE LAST YEAR WHICH IS IN THIS REPORT. BUT WHAT YOU ALSO PLAN ON ACCOMPLISHING THE NEXT YEAR SO WITH THAT JUST SOME SOME PARTS OF THAT BACKGROUND- FIRST IS YOU PROVIDE THE BUDGET ON ON PAGE FORTY BUTIT'S VERY SPARSE AND IT DOESN'T SHOW. BUDGET TO ACTUAL- IT DOESN'T SHOW FOR OUR YOUR CURRENT YEAR. MAYBE MAYBE JUST AN IDEA THAT WE COULD IF WE COULD PROVIDE MORE DATA THERE- ALSO WITH THE PLANET FROM PAGE EIGHTY SIX TO NINETY NINE- ON PAGE FORTY SIX. YOU YOU ACTUALLY AS AS SENATOR HILLARY PLENTY THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE DATA BUT WHAT WHAT YOU% DON'T HAVE WITH WITH THE DATA ON PAGE FORTY SIX IS WHAT WERE YOU PLANNING TO ACHIEVE. A USING THE EXAMPLE THAT SENATOR HILL RAISED ON INSPECTIONS IF THE COLUMN IN FRONT OF THE TOTAL- WOULD HAVE SAID THAT YOU EXPECTED TO DO NO- INSPECTIONS. THEN YOU WOULD HAVE MET YOUR TARGET OF ZERO- BUT THEN THE NEXT CALL WOULD BE WHAT YOU EXPECTED TO IN TWENTY TWENTY HOW MANY INSPECTIONS WOULD BE FIVE WOULD BE TEN. AND SO THEN WE WOULD HAVE SOME PANIC COMPARISON OF YOU ARE ARE ARE THE SPECIFIC. GOALS BEING. MET AT THIS REPORT ALTHOUGH EXTREMELY THOROUGH MARGE DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T GIVE ONE A SENSE OF WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IF YOU HAD. COMPLAINTS THIRTY THREE THIRTY SIX HOW MANY COMPLAIN THREE ACTING FIFTY THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND. EIGHT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND SOME CONTEXT- ALSO WE JUST A THEM SOME SPECIFIC. ON ON PAGES THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY FOR YOUR HAVE THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART. AND NOW THAT YOU ARE IN THIS POSITION I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION AS TO HOW YOUR- ACCLIMATING TO THE NEW POSITION- HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE OF THE UC. IS IT A TWO LARGES IT'S- COVERING TOO MANY AREAS HOW ARE YOU HANDLING ALL THE VARIOUS DIVISIONS. AND JUST MAYBE JUST GIVE A QUICK UPDATE ON HOW YOU'RE DOING. WELL THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION. IS SORT OF CHANGES DAY TODAY. IT TRULY HAS BEEN- QUITE AN EXPERIENCE THAT BASICALLY STARTED LATE AUGUST EARLY SEPTEMBER HERE AT THE UC AND- WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AGAIN. IN OCTOBER AND SO IT IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT TRIAL BY FIRE AND TERMS OF THE WORK BEFORE IT AND ALL THE WHILE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAD SOME VERY SERIOUS PROCEEDINGS BEFORE AS- SPECIFICALLY. IN A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING BUT WE INITIATED SO MANY OTHER IMPORTANT PROCEEDINGS ARE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AS A RESULT OF THE WILDFIRE S. P. S. SOME OF WHICH I MENTIONED IN MY REMARKS. SO IT'S BEEN BUSY IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY BUSY AND I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH YOUR INTEREST IN DATA IN THE REPORT AND WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON THE INSPECTION CAN AND I APPRECIATE. THAT RESULTS AND WE ALSO PERMIT IS HOW YOU MANAGE. I IN IT ORANGE COUNTY AND HAVE TO ANSWER GOVERNMENT OFFER I. THAT VERY VERY MUCH GIVEN MANY. THAT WE HAD TO IMPROVE. GOVERNMENT AND IMPROVE- HOW GOVERNMENT FUNCTION WHEN I WASN'T AT SECOND HERE GOT LOST. I'M FURTHER IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION ABOUT IS SIZE ADEQUATE. IS WHAT WE DO TOO BROAD TOO MUCH. ON I'M A GOVERNOR WHO GOVERN PURSE AND SO WHEN YOU'RE ASKING GOVERNOR PERSON ABOUT IT DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THE ANSWER IS USUALLY NO WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES BUT I DON'T SAY THAT- I THINK THAT WE WORK VERY HARD AT THE PC I'VE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY. IMPRESSED WITH THE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF THE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYEDAT THE PC I'M INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED EVERY DAY WITH MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS AND THE WORKLOAD THAT THEY ALL HAVE. AND ACCOMPLISH- AND THEY'VE BEEN EXTREMELY KIND AND GENEROUS TO ME AS I HAVE TAKEN ON THIS ROLE AND HAD IN SOMERS QUITE A LEARNING CURVE. SO I'VE BEEN A VERY APPRECIATIVE OF. HELL THEY HAVE LISTED AND THEN AS A CERTAIN KIND TO ME. THERE ARE WE DO DO A LOT OF THE PC WE ARE SIGNED A LOT IN TERMS OF BOTH OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION AS WELL AS THOSE STATUTORY- RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M I HAVE BEEN ASKED MORE THAN ONCE ABOUT WHAT WHAT IF WE WERE TO SHED BUT WOULD BE SHED. THAT'S REALLYHARD FOR ME TO EVALUATE PRECISELY WHAT DATA AT AS I WOULD LIKE TO DO BUT THERE ARE AREAS IN THE TRANSPORTATION AREA SHOULD WE RE RE BE REGULATING UBER AND LEFT FOR EXAMPLE. YEAH NOT WHO SHOULD WE DO IT ON THIS VEHICLES IF NOT THEN YOU LOOK AT THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY LOOK AT DIEM. ARE PEOPLE ASKED WHETHER WE SHOULD BE DOING SAFETY I THINK IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE A VERY ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY THIS WILL BE. OUR ARE JUST TO TELL CHEESE ALL. ARE OUR OB IN THIS AND SAFE MANNER IN SO. THE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. SO I DON'T HAVE A FAVORITE. RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD. ADOPT OUT. BUT I DO THINK EVERY AGENCY IN GOVERNMENT ALL USE AND AFTER TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE. AND I DARE SAY THAT IS TRUE ABOUT THE PC IS IT IS. GOV OPS TRANSPORTATION HHS SO- WE DO HAVE AYE WE DO HAVE AN EFFORT TO REFORM OUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESSES UNDER WAY- AND I THINK THERE'S BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE I IT WITHIN OUR RULES OF PROCEDURE THAT TO BE ECONOMIST IF YOU WILL- WE ALSO WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER AREAS IN OUR PROCEEDINGS THAT- ALSO COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE WITH SOME BUSINESS RE ENGINEERING. AND WE'LL BE TAKING THOSE WE ARE WELL UNDER WAY IN THE REFORMS COMMISSIONER WRECK SHAMANIC COMMISSIONER RANDALL AND WORKING ON THAT FOR TWO YEARS. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. AS I WILL BE WITH SOME BUSINESS RE ENGINEERING AND OTHER PARTS OF THE PC. THAT WAS A LITTLE LONG WINDED I'M SORRY SENATOR- I HOLDING CASH ON THE PLACES YOU ASK. WE DID A GREAT JOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH I- APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU HAD TO JUMP IN- JUST BEFORE THE MAJOR PS PS- EVENTS AND SO IT'S BEEN A RATHER UNIQUE YEAR FOR. US TO SENATORS AS WELL- THIS YEAR AND DEALING WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN. PANDEMIC AND NOW THE RECENT DAYS DEALING WITH- THE- LLOYD GEORGE REVERBERATIONS ARE JUST A LOT GOING ON. AND WITH THAT. SHELTERING IN PLACE AND THE REST WE REALIZE HOW DEPENDENT WE ARE ON. THEY ARE OUR ELECTRICITY- HAVING ACCESS TO OUR TELEVISION TO OUR CELL PHONE GETTING IT CHARGED EVERY DAY- IN IN AND SO IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME A I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO NEGATIVE BUT- IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL WHAT. WHAT IF- AFTER PS PS KNOWING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ELECTRICITY IS OUT FOR A WEEK IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS OF WHAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO ONE OF OUR MAJOR- ELECTRICITY GENERATING FACILITIES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN. YOU KNOW OF A PART OF THE STATE WAS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY NOT FOR A FEW DAYS BUT MAYBE A FEW WEEKS. DO WE HAVE BEEN KIND OF EMERGENCY PLANNERS BEING A PLACE FOR SOMETHING OF THAT MAY. BUT WE RE AT THE IT IS FOR AN. YOU'RE ASKED TO STAY YOUR HOME AWHILE. ARE YOU SAYING SENATOR IF OF THE THESE WAS NOT ABLE TO AT ALL I THEIR TIME SYSTEM WENT DOWN. I'M IN FOR AN EXTREME EMERGENCY A PLAN THAT NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN KINDA NIBBLING AT SOME PRETTY UNIQUE EXPERIENCES. EACH OF THE UTILITIES HAS EIGHTY- OPERATIONAL PLAN AND MERCHANTS SEEK PLAN- I'M NOT IN. SPECIFICALLY FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF THAT THEY- THEY LIKE WE IN GOVERNMENT HAVE TO HAVE. OPERATIONAL PLANS AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CANNOT FUNCTION AS AN ENTITY- I'M GONNA ASK CAROLINE WITH HER BACKGROUND IN ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IF SHE'S MORE FAMILIAR THAN I AM SPECIFIC PLANS OF THE UTILITIES OUT HERE SO- SENATOR SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. BUT BEYOND WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS MENTIONED TERMS UTILITIES PLANS BUT I CAN SAY FROM MY FORMER ROLE ON IN STATE EMERGENCY MANAGEMNT THAT WE DIDN'T DO EXERCISES FOR LONG TERM POWER OUTAGES SO THAT THERE WAS ANY STATE RESPONSE PLAN. COORDINATED WITH THE UTILITIES AND ALL THE AFFILIATED PARTNERS ON- HOW TO RESPOND TO A LONG TERM OUTRAGE IN THE I CAN LONG TERM BEING DEFINED WEEKS AS OPPOSED TO DATE. AND THAT'S CAN BY THE OFFICER. SERVICES UNDER DIRECTOR. ALLEN DID SHE AND I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE LAST EXERCISE WAS CONDUCTED LAST SUMMER WAS A LACK THEY MAY HAVE DONE ONE SINCE I LEFT IT IN IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR BUT THERE WAS ONE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND THEY HAVE BEEN ONE THAT PRIOR TO SUMMER AS LONG TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GREAT THANK THANK YOU I HAD PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE IS PREPARING FOR SONGS WHICH IS THE AND FREE NUCLEAR GENERATING A PLANT- IN SAN DIEGO ON THE MARCH TWENTY. SO WE HAD PLENTY OF DRILLS WHILE I WAS A KID SUPERVISOR BY A IN RECENT MONTHS AFTER KIND OF EXPERIENCING WHAT WE'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING KIND OF WONDERFUL. YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK THIS IS BAD WHAT IF WE LOST OUR ELECTRICITY SO I WILL ASK TO BE A ABOVE THE THREE I COMPANIES TODAY THAT QUESTION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU- PRESIDENT BACHELOR PARTY. YOUR CANDID THAT'S- THANK YOU WILL CENTER WIENER. BUT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OF COURSE FOR PRESIDENT OF BACHELOR AND I APPRECIATE- YOU AND YOUR TEAM UPDATING US TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR- FOR- DURING- CREDIBLY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TIME PERIOD I THINK WITH A- EVERYTHING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE DAMAGE. THE ROOM THE PROTESTS AROUND POLICE VIOLENCE SOMETIMES YOU. CAN BE TOO EASY TO FORGET THAT WE ALSO HAVE A MAJOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY AND BANKRUPTCY TOTALLY UNSTABLE- UTILITY- AND OF COURSE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES LATER THIS YEAR IT'S- DEFINITELY A- CHALLENGING TIME HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR MANY REASONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN YOUR LEADERSHIP ON I HAVE  SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT- THE AFTER PROGRAM. THE US OF GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM AS CHIP- AS I KNOW YOU KNOW- I AUTHORED LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WENT INTO EFFECT IN TWENTY NINETEEN SO WE'RE ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AND- AS YOU KNOW I'VE HAD SOME DISAGREEMENTS WITH- THE COMMISSION ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF A CHIP THE PURPOSE OF US TO OF COURSE IS TO PROVIDE. FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO INSTALL- ENERGY STORAGE- FOR SOLAR OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES- WHICH OF COURSE EXPANDS ARE CLEAN ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA THIS WINTER CLIMATE GOALS- AND ALSO. INCREASE ENERGY RESILIENCE SO THAT WE DO HAVE- VALUES ARE. THE SHUTDOWNS OR TWO BLACKOUTS BUT PEOPLE CAN GENERATE THEIR OWN POWER IT ALSO REDUCES THE NEED FOR ON AND THE EXPANSION OF TRANSMISSION LINES. WHICH HAVE BEEN EXPANDED SO DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST TWO DECADES OFTEN THE WILDFIRES OWNS. WHICH INCREASES THE RISK OF WILDFIRE. WE PASSES LAW ON IN MY DO RESPECTFULLY- THE COMMISSION- ON. MULTIPLE OCCASIONS HAS PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW THAT WOULD- STABILITY IMPLEMENTATION ORIGINALLY. A STAFF MADE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE OF YES SIR PROGRAM ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO IMPLEMENT ULTIMATELY THEN THE COMMISSION MADE PROPOSALS- THAT WOULD HAVE DEBILITATED THE PROGRAM. ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION ADOPTED. A IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WHICH WILL NOT TOTALLY DEBILITATING THE PROGRAM DRAMATICALLY RESTRICT SAID MORE THAN SIXTY. A THE OFFICE OF PRIME ON CAN. I AM ROLE HAVE TO GO INTO A VERY VERY LIMITED AREAS- THAT ARE BOTH HIGH WILD FIRE RISK AND LOW INCOME- EVEN THOUGH WE ALREADY SET ASIDE IN THE STATUTE THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE- AS TO FUNDS FOR- FIVE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW'S IT GOING HOW'S THE ROLL OUT. HOW MUCH MONEY HAS GONE OUT FOR US TO- HEALTH SUCCESSFUL IS ON THE ROLL OUT BECAUSE I LOVE BEING PROVEN WRONG- AND- ON THE ISSUE LIKE THIS AND IF I'M WRONG AND OTHER CITY UC'S. IMPLEMENTATION IS GONE DYING BUSTERS ARE GOING GREAT I WILL BE HAPPY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'M WRONG BUT I WAS WRONG- SO I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW WHERE WE ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO. YES WELL AWARE AND RESPECTFUL. HAD A ONE OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THAT EXCHANGE ONE OF THE FIRST MEANS I HAD AFTER RETURNING AFTER BEING SWORN IN- WAS WAS AND MEETING WITH YOU AND SENATOR STERN REGARDING YOUR YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT GENERATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO ANSWER HOW'S IT GOING AND IT IS JUST A REMINDER- IMPLEMENT SEVEN SB SEVEN SEVEN HUNDRED SKEWS ME SHE YOU SEE ADDED EIGHT HUNDRED. BUDGET PROGRAM AND ALLOCATE FIVE UNDER TWELVE FOR THE GLOBAL. RESIDENTS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY THE WELFARE UTILITY POWER SHOPS AND STATE SENATOR YOU NOT IT. THE. THEN THE NEW PROGRAM OPERATIONS THAT- ON THAT WE'VE MENTIONED FOR THE LONGER CUSTOMERS OPEN IN MAY AND DEMONSTRATED TREMENDOUS INTEREST- NEARLY TWO THOUSAND APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED IN THE FIRST WEEK WHICH ACTUALLY EXHAUSTED THE HUNDRED MILLION IN FUNDING. IN THE PGA ANY S. T. E. N. S. T. G. ANY SERVICE TERRITORIES. DID YOU DON'T FUNDING THAT WAS APPROVED PURSUANT TO SB SEVEN HUNDRED WILL BE- RELEASED SHORTLY- SHORTLY. SO WE'VE HEARD SOME DOUBT FROM THE STORAGE INDUSTRY ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THAT OF A SUFFICIENT INTEREST IN THE NEW PROGRAM AND FEARS ABOUT THE FUNDING GETTING AN ALLEY GOING ON ALLOCATED EXCUSE ME. I ASSURE YOU THAT WE HAVE BUILT IN THE NECESSARY PROGRAM TOOLS TO REALLOCATE FUNDING IN A TIMELY MANNER IF AND WHEN NEEDED BUT OUR INITIAL SIGNALS THIS MOST RECENT PROGRAM OPENING. INTO A DENTIST SIGNIFICANT INTEREST- MUCH WE'RE STILL IS TO BE DONE TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF THE WILDFIRES AND THE- YEAH. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. IS GOALS SO I'M I THINK THAT FOR US TO A VERY GOOD START AND WE WILL DEFINITELY YOU IN YOUR OFFICE INFORM CYNDER OF THE- ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THE RELEASE THAT I SPOKE OF THAT WILL HAPPEN SHORTLY. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT AND- I GUESS I WOULD REQUEST AND I'D APPRECIATE IF WE COULD GET- REGULAR EVEN IF IT'S EVERY TWO OR THREE MONTHS- A REPORT ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY HAS GONE OUT HOW THE PROGRAM IS GOING- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. PERHAPS THE SENDS ME OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS. COMMITTEE SO THAT WOULD BE A ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. PLEASE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU KNOW WE'LL GO TO SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MY QUESTIONS WERE DIRECTED REGARDING AWHILE FIRE SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD AND THERE WAS. QUESTION WHETHER UTILITIES ARE DEVELOPING ADEQUATE- TRAINING PROGRAM TO DEAL WITH. THIS VEGETATION WHILE FIRE MITIGATION SO MY QUESTION IS TRUE IS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE ARE IN THAT AREA AND ALSO ADDITIONAL ELECTRICAL WORKERS THAT IT WAS SUGGESTED IT ALSO STATED THE DIFFICULTY THE DIFFICULTY AND FINDING EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL TO DO THE WORK SO I'M TRYING TO. FIND DANCE IS THE QUESTION DOES UTILITIES HAVE ADEQUATE PERSONNEL TO DO THIS WORK AND TOO IF NOT. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS TO THE PC HAVE AND HELPING UTILITIES ADDRESS THAT PERSONNEL SHORTFALL AND FINALLY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE AND CRITICISM I SHOULD STAY. AS IT RELATES TO P. S. P. S. DOT ESPECIALLY DIRECTED TO THE UTILITIES- WHAT ROLE OUR LOCAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE TAKEN THIS AS WELL AS THE P. YOU SEE BECAUSE IT WAS THE LEGISLATURE WHO DIRECTED THE UTILITIES THE USE PS PS BUT WILL CONTINUE TO FALL ON THE UTILITIES FOR DOING EXACTLY WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO SO. I FIND IT A LITTLE BIT IRONIC. I'M TO ADDRESS THOSE OTHER GROUND AND THE LEVEL OF. CAROLINE IN THEN I CAN ADD TO IN TERMS OF. THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH PERSONNEL OR NOT DO YOU WANT TO. ON THE GROUND AND WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE YEAH SO- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND YOU LITERALLY JUST ARTICULATED ONE OF THE DEFICIENCIES THAT WE FOUND IN THE OFFER MEDICATION PLANS. BECAUSE THEY DID IDENTIFY. POTENTIAL COUNTRY OF WORKFORCE IT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THEIR WATER MITIGATION PLAN INITIATIVES- BUT WE DIDN'T FEEL ARTICULATED. DETAIL DETAIL TO GIVE US CONFIDENCE THEY HAVE A PLAN TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HOME IN- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL OUR GUYS RESOLUTION A COMMON DEFICIENCY. THAT THEY ALL NEED TO BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE. WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE AND IF YOU. GIVE ME ONE MINUTE I'LL FIND OUT WHETHER. IN THAT CLASS THEIR CLASS BE BUT IT THE CLASSIC ANY US WHAT THE- IS WITH THE- BY DAYS IN THE- CLASS. IT WOULD BE THEY WOULD INTEREST TO US WITHIN. DAY SO WHILE PRESIDENT BACK INTO THE REMAINING ALL OF THAT FOR YOU. SO THERE DIFFERENT. CAMPS BOTH. FRANKLY WITHIN THE- COURTS. AS WELL AS DISCUSSION BUT YOU CAN ALLEGE. A HAD AND- I'LL- THE- RESPONSE. OF THE WELFARE MITIGATE. THERE AND SAFETY DIVISION IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL BOOTS ON THE GROUND THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE HIRED. USUALLY CONTRACTED- AND THEN AND THEN WHAT KIND OF QUALITY ASSURANCE PLAN DO THEY HAVE TO ALSO DOUBLE CHECK IF THE AND EDUCATION PLANS THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING ARE EFFECTIVE AND ARE THEY BEING DONE PROPERLY BY THE BY THE CONTRACTORS. RECENTLY THE FEDERAL CHEN AT ONE OF THE FEDERAL JUDGES. IN HEART. OF THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING HAD ON HAND INQUIRED ABOUT WHETHER P. JEANNIE SHOULD HIRE IN HOUSE- AND THOSE FOLKS THAT WOULD BE DO WE NEED TO EDUCATION REMOVAL AND ALSO THE QUALITY ASSURANCE- I'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO THE DISCUSSION AND SPEND ON GOING IN THAT PROCEEDING HOWEVER I THINK THAT THE LABOR SHORTAGE HAS BEEN A REAL ISSUE FOR THEM- NOW WITH KOBE NINETEEN AND THE HORRIBLE AND EMPLOYMENT THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AS A COUNTRY MAYBE THAT CHANGES HOWEVER. THERE IS AN END OF. IT NEEDS TO GO ON BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST. THROW UNTRAINED PERSON OUT INTO THE FIELD TO REMOVE. AND VEGETATION AND BE DONE IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE THOROUGH PROCESS AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE I'M IMPLEMENTED. SO I THINK THAT SOME OF THAT THE LIMITATIONS THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED AND I'M GONNA LET CAROLINE GIVEN THE STATISTICS THAT WE HAVE NOTED THAT YES THEY DONE ON MANY OF THE ACRE MILES THAT THEY TALKED ABOUT- THAT BUT THE QUALITY ASSURANCE IN THE CHECKING OUT THAT. HAS MAYBE NOT BEEN IS COMPLETED AND- AS AS HAS BEEN NEEDED. ANA FOR THEIR SHARE US THAT. SO TO FOLLOW UP ON THE SO WITH THE CLASS THE EFFICIENCY IS WHAT WE HI SO BASICALLY HAVE NINETY TO US WHAT THEY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO INTERPRET IN TRAIN RESIDENT BACK POINT. PERSONNEL OF OUR KEY MOTIVATE HERE'S A WANNA MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT SO OF. YOU KNOW ROBIN PETER ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL AND OF THE MOVING THIS. TO CROSS THE STATE. WE WERE SURE THAT WHOLE LIST APPROACH THAT THIS. INCREASES THE CAPACITY BUT TO THE- ADDITIONAL POINT THAT PRESIDENT AFTER BROUGHT OUT. THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH. QUALITY OF THE EDUCATION MANAGEMENT- IT LAST YEAR SO IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS YEAR IS TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THERE. THE. DID YOU. THEIR OWN QUALITY ASSURE. ON EDUCATION MANAGER. AND THEN WE'RE COMING IN. IN CHECKING THAT AS WELL. TO DO. THE TO THE- OF THEIR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. VERY WELL WE'LL GO NOW OUT IN THE STILL THAN ADDRESS THE PS PS ISSUE AS IT AS IT RELATES TO. SOME OWNERSHIP. BOB THE LEGISLATURE THE PC TO SO YOU JUST CAN'T CONTINUE TO PILE ON THE UTILITY FOR DOING WHAT WAS DIRECTED SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE. OTHER THOUGHTS ON THAT. WELL I WOULD. HESITATE STRONGLY TO EVER DIRECT THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING OR NOT DOING THAT WOULD BE. WELL OUT OF MY ROLE AND INAPPROPRIATE ACTUALLY IN MY OWN PERSONAL% OPINION I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE. SOME INCREDIBLE WORK WHEN IT COMES TO. ALLOW THEIR MEDICATION AND I THINK THAT- CAN GET YOU FOR AND NO ONE WERE CREDIBLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. AND WERE ENACTED IN. AN UNBELIEVABLE SHORT OF TIME. AND WE'RE SO INCOME THE SAME AND- TO COME FROM. GETTING THE SETTING THAT SETTING DATES AND TIMEFRAMES FOR THE BANKRUPTCY. EXCEPT AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING AND IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF SAFETY- THE THESE WERE THESE WERE LARGE LARGE PIECES OF- OF. OF LEGISLATION FOR WHICH I THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE- GREATLY- GREATLY THANKS BY THIS IS OF. YEAH YEAH SO AND REALLY NOW I KNOW IT CAN DO TO FOR WAS SO OF AN AT AND ON GOING FROM NINE NO WAY SO I WOULD LEAVE IT SIR TO ALL TO WHAT STILL LEFT ON THE TABLE IF YOU WILL TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA BUT I THINK INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. WORKING UNDER BROWN AND THEN GOVERNOR NEW SON- INCREDIBLE PROGRESSIVE. THOUGHTFUL AND PROBABLY IMPORTANT A LEGISLATION WHAT IS WEST PASSED IN AND ENACTED. SO IN TERMS OF OUR P. S. TS RESPONSIBILITY I THINK WE OUTLINE A GOOD DEAL OF IT TODAY- I THINK THAT. MICHAEL THINGS SENATOR THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAT CAN BE DONE THAT I ACE THINKS THAT SINCEFROM OCTOBER TWO NOW JUNE- WE HAVE HAVE TAKEN UP AND COMPLETED. SIX SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT HELP YES YES IS TO BE ADMINISTERED FROM THE GUIDELINES THAT WE JUST APPROVED LAST WEEK. TWO DIFFERENT IMPORTANT PROCEEDINGS LIKE THE- THE RECENT OPENING AND THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROCEEDING AROUND MY COMPLIANCE- THAT WAS DONE ESSENTIALLY SIX MONTHS SO I THINK THAT THAT WE HAVE THIS IS SO WE CAN ALWAYS DO MORE I THINK WE'VE HAD A- STRONG SENSE OF URGENCY. AND AN IMPORTANT. AND I MEAN PLEASE AT THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH AND- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT NOW THAT WE HOLD THE UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. SEC SENATOR REDONE. I WAS JUST GONNA SAY MY CRITICISM WHAT'S NOT ON THE LEGISLATION NINE A ONE OR TEN FIFTY FOUR JUST AGAIN ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WHAT WAS DIRECTED BY THEM AND- THE- I THINK THE OVER- A- ACCUSATIONS THAT THE UTILITIES HAVE FAILED THIS. STATE IN SOME WAY BY DOING WHAT WAS DIRECTED TO LEGISLATION. THE CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D I'D CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT POINT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO OWN THIS. S. P. S. CHALLENGE HERE AND I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING TOGETHER AND FOR THE FOCUS. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS WAYS TO POINT BLAME DURING A CRISIS BUT I JUST WITH COMMANDS. MR NATCHER OVER HER LEADERSHIP AND COMING IN DURING THE FIRE LITERALLY AND- PROVIDING STEADY AS IN RESOLVING AN ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCE I THINK THAT. WON'T EVER REALLY FULLY BE APPRECIATED WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT THIS BANKRUPTCY. I SAYS AND HOW CLOSE WE GOT TO THE BRINK OF A MAJOR FINANCIAL CRISIS- THE CREDIBILITY WITH WHICH THE PC IS FLEXED ITS AUTHORITY UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE IN. UNDER TEN FIFTY FOUR NINE A ONE AS WELL AS BEEN REALLY- CRITICAL ELEMENT TO. STANDING STRONG AND I THINK PUTTING P. JEANNIE. IN THEIR PLACE WHICH IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC FOR THEY ARE PUBLIC UTILITY- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT LEADERSHIP MY QUESTION FOLLOWS FOLLOWS ON- SENATOR HILLS LINE OF QUESTIONING ON NATURAL GAS SAFETY AS WELL AS- MY COLLEAGUES- EARLIER REGARDING- MICRO AGREED DEVELOPMENT IN THE SPEED OF THE PAST YEAR PROGRAM SO FIRST OFF- ON MICRO GRACE AND THE S. CHIP PROGRAM. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THE EXPEDITIOUS PRECEDING ON THIRTEEN THIRTY NINE IMPLEMENTATION AND REALLY ASK- YOU HIGHLIGHTED THE S. CHIP DEMAND AS WELL- WHICH IS REALLY FOCUSING ALSO ON THESE THESE FIRE ZONES- DO WE- DO WE HAVE TO GO. A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE ORDER OR IS THERE A MORE STRATEGIC WAY YOU THINK WE CAN POTENTIALLY DEPLOY THE STF ASSETS- SO THAT THEY DO HAVE SORT OF BROADER RESILIENCY BENEFITS AND PERHAPS ADD TO. DISTRIBUTION GREAT RESILIENCY THAT COULD DOVE TAIL WITH THE EXPEDITED MICROGROOVE DEVELOPMENT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. NOT SURE AT THIS THANK YOU- CENTER VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMPLIMENTS I APPRECIATE THEM VERY MUCH I HOPE I CAN STILL ON. LIVE UP TO THOSE COMPLIMENTS IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OR AT THE EN OF THE NEXT SIX MONTHS- I DO NOT. TURN TO MISTER RAN. EXPLAIN RATHER HOW WE DO THE I KNOW THIS THE APPLICATION- BUT I'M NOT SURE OF THE PROCESS AND IT'S FIRST COME FIRST SERVE OR NOT. SENATOR STARTED THANK YOU THE QUESTION. I THINK MAYBE IN A- MORE RUDIMENTARY MANNER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE COMMISSION ACTUALLY IS TRYING TO DO WITH THE VARIOUS- BUCKETS OF FUNDING THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER- S. TRIP AT THIS MOMENT TIME WHEN THE COMMISSION IN JANUARY VOTED OUT- THE DECISION TO EXPAND THE BUDGET- AS AUTHORIZED BY SB SEVEN HUNDRED- AND- FIND IT. YEAH ALLOCATE THAT MONEY TO DIFFERENT- BUCKETS OF FINDING IT WAS VERY INTENTIONAL AND- TARGETING THE MONEY TOWARDS THE COMMUNITIES TOWARDS THE INDIVIDUALS- TOWARDS THE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT ARE GONNA BE MOST IMPACTED BY IT- YES YES ABOUT- IT ALSO DID PROVIDE FOR MECHANISMS AFTER TWO YEARS TO REALLOCATE- MONEY FROM VARIOUS POCKETS IF IT'S NOT SPENT- THAT GIVES US THE MECHANISM YES- WE FIND UMBRELLA ORGANIZATIONS AREN'T WORKING- TO REALLOCATE OVER OTHER PRIORITIZATION- BUT FOR JUST POINT OF REFERENCE. OUT OF THE WHAT WE CALL THE EQUITY RESULT. BUCKET WHICH IS- FOR- CUSTOMERS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY PS PS ADVANCED- BUT ALSO NEED OTHER EQUITY CRITERIA AND TURNS OF ANY COM OR MEDICAL NEEDS OR OTHER NEEDS- FACT IS THE POCKET THAT PRESIDENT BATTER MENTIONED. OPEN UP FOR ELIGIBILITY AND NAY AND THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND THAT FINE- IS FULLY UTILIZE THAT WAS ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BUT WE pDOLLARS AND APPLICATIONS. AND IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS- THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOWED UNDER SB SEVEN HUNDRED WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THAT POCKET AND I BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT HAVING A DRINKING FOR GOING TO LEAVE THAT FOR EXACT FUND UP TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED NINE. NINE BILLION YEAH MY QUESTION IS JUST ABOUT THAT HUNDRED MILLION AND I KNOW MANY- SORT OF SMALL MOM AND POP SAY NURSING HOMES INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS- SIR LESS SOPHISTICATED ENTITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY WHO AREN'T IN LINE WHERE IS THE MORE SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS I THINK GOT SMART AND GOT IN LINE SO. I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP ON HOW TO BE EQUITABLE IN THAT EQUITY RESILIENCY BUDGET ALLOCATION AND REALLY THROUGH WHAT MORE WE CAN DO WITH THOSE THAT. AND WHETHER THEY CAN BE REPURPOSED IN THE FEW POTENTIALLY EVEN FOR A DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TO SUPPORT MICRO GRID DEVELOPMENT SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS ON THAT I WANT TO SO WHERE DO YOU ACT THERE TO BE IN MICRO GREENS DEPLOYED BEFORE. THIS P. S. T. S. SEASON CENTER WE WERE HELP THAT. I HAVE TO BE. DIRECT HOWEVER I WAS MOST HELPFUL- IN THE P. JEANNIE CASE BECAUSE THEY- PLAN TO DO AND HAS PUT TOGETHER AN RFP- UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS WITHDRAWN AND- THIS SUBSTATION AND THE- MICHAEL UNITS THAT THEY HAD PLANNED. ARE LIKELY THEIR BACKUP POWER WILL. LIKELY BE. YOURS FOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY AND WELFARE SEASON. AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE IN THE TELCO AREA THAT THAT THAT THE BACKUP POWER. BACKUP BATTERY GENERATION WILL MOSTLY BE THINGS THAT WILL BE. GENERATED BY DIESEL. DIESEL AND GASOLINE. I THAT'S FOR TWENTY WE HAVE IN OUR PROCEEDINGS AND IN ALL OUR DISCUSSIONS HAVE HAVE PUT FORTH THAT THEY HAVE TO STRIVE FOR TOWARD- RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THEY- IN DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS BOTH ON THE TELCO SIDE AS WELL AS ON ME I USED SIDE. ARM THERE ARE DIFFERENT STAGES OF. ADOPTING ON RENEWABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY PLANS BUT I DO NOT THINK THERE WILL WILL SEE THAT FOR WELFARE SEASON TWENTY TWENTY DISAPPOINTING NEWS- I WOULD ASK YOU JUST FROM THE FUTURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF SOME KIND EXPEDITED UNIFORM TERROR FOR THAT KIND OF CLEAN MICROGROOVE DEVELOPMENT PERHAPS THAT WOULD SPEED THINGS ALONG- THE LAST QUESTION GOES TO THE NATURAL GAS SAFETY ISSUE THAT SENATOR HILL MENTIONED EARLIER- LITTLE DIFFERENT PART OF THE SYSTEM DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU KNOW- MY DISTRICT AND BROADER LA WAS IMPACTED GREATLY BY THE ALLEY SO CANYON BELOW OUT. THE DATA WE'VE SEEN SHOWS A MARKET INCREASING UTILIZATION OF THAT STORAGE ASSET. IN LA BY ARE COUNTING OVER 3000% INCREASE SINCE THE WITHDRAWAL PROTOCOL WAS CHANGED CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE PLANS FOR UTILIZATION OF A LEASE SO AND REALLY WHETHER- THERE'S STILL A COMMITMENT TO DO THE DILIGENCE ON THAT FEASIBILITY OF CLOSE YOUR ANALYSIS IN THE EXPEDITED DISCUSSED. YES SENATOR AND WE ARE- WE DO HAVE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY HAPPENED YOU HAVE BUDGETED AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY GOVERNOR DIRECTED LAST FALL. AND THAT MONEY STILL AS RAIN MAINTAINED IN THE BUDGET TO DO IN IN A VERY- THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF A LEASE SO- AND WE WILL HAVE THAT UNDER WAY AS SOON AS THE BUDGET IS APPROVED. I MEAN TURN TO ADD TO GIVE YOU SOME SORT SOME OF. THE SPECIFICS I AM- I HAVE NOT SEEN THE BACKUP. IN REGARDING THAT NUMBER OF USAGE I'VE HEARD THAT NUMBER AND I WAS PUZZLED BY IT. I JUST REALIZED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS SO AND CAN YOU BE SURE. AND YOUR SENATOR STERN- YA ON THE FIRST POINT IS TO KIND OF REITERATE THE TIMING- YOU KNOW AS AS YOU'RE VERY WHERE SINCE YOU'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS EVEN SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE SENATOR- YOUNG GOVERNOR BROWN HAD- YOU KNOW THROUGH THE CDC HAD- DIRECTED THE P. ARE ASKED TO PC TO LOOK AT- FEASIBILITY OF CLOSING THE FIELD DOWN WITHIN TEN YEARS AND COME UP WITH SPECIFIC. THAT WHICH GOES BEYOND WHAT- SB THREE EIGHTY- HAD DIED AS YOU KNOW THERE BEEN SOME I CHALLENGES AND- CONTRACTING ISSUES FOR ALL. OF THAT THE PC IS COMMITTED TO- DATA ANALYSIS ON LOOKING ADD- WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CLOSE THE FUEL DOWN- YOUR WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE THAT. GOVERNOR BROWN HAS MADE THAT. SUGGESTION WHICH IS TWENTY. ANY SEVEN AND THEN ALSO AT. A LONGER TO YOU KNOW IN THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE AS WE CAN LONG TERM ON A PLANE AROUND THAT AS WELL. AS FAR AS THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE OF THE INCREASES OF- WITHDRAWALS YEAH A LISA CANYON. YEAH IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT- CHANGE IN OPERATION IS IMPACTS SAFETY. IS THE VOLUME OF GAS THAT STORE IN THE FIELD- AND IS YOUR- AWARE- BEFORE THE- ROB CERTAINLY SO CANYON THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY THAT FIELD WAS EIGHTY SIX BILLION CUBIC FEET- SB THREE EIGHTY REQUIRES A P. C. TO SET A LIMIT THAT IS BASED ON- THE MAX AMOUNT IT'S THE- NEEDED FOR PROVIDING RELIABILITY ADD JUST AND REASONABLE RATES SO WE LOOK AT THAT AS A BALANCE. OF BOTH THE ABSOLUTE REALIZE RELIABILITY IT ALSO IMPACTS ON- WHOLESALE AND RETAIL GAS MARKETS. THAT IS WAS SET AT THIRTY THREE MILLION. THIRTY FOUR BILLION CUBIC FEET. AND AT THIS MOMENT TIME WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF CHANGING THAT KAPPLE. NOT IN THE FUTURE THERE WAS MAYBE ARTFULLY WORD PRESS REPORTS RECENTLY THE MADE IT SO LIKE THE YOU TO ONE TO THE STORAGE UPSET EIGHTY SAY BILLION CUBIC FEET AGAIN BUT THEY WOULD NOT BE TO THAT THE CAPITAL THIRTY. IS AS THE WITHDRAWAL IS YES THEY HAVE GONE THAT THREE THOUSAND NUMBERS NOT A ON THE NUMBER OF WITHDRAWALS BUT THE VOLUME IT'S BEEN WITHDRAWN- OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS COMPARED TO- THE TWO YEARS- AFTER- NAY BEGAN WITHDRAWING FROM THE FIELD AGAIN- BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISON- I GIVE IN- LEAD THAT. THE DIED THOUSAND NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WORK COLLECTIVELY HOLDER THEN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS AND SO THERE'S HIGHER GAS DEMAND OVERALL- AND THEN THE CHALLENGES- THAT WE'VE HAD WITH SO CAL GAS AND A NUMBER OF PIPELINES BENG OUT OF SERVICE. TO REDUCE PRESSURE. THERE WERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOT SENATOR DODD. THANK VERY THIS CHAIRMAN. HE'S ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT SENATOR WILL- BRADFORD IS LEFT BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO ADDRESS HIS. COMMENTS AS THE AUTHOR OF SB NINE OH ONE. I WANT TO REMIND- WHAT. EVERYBODY WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH AT THE TIME AND HOW MUCH BACK BLOOD THERE WAS A LACK OF MAINTENANCE ON THE LINE. SIX BILLION PGD AND WHY THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT. ISSUE RELATIVE TO THE WILD FIRES THAT DAMAGED SENATOR MAGUIRE'S AND- MY DISTRICT SO UNBELIEVABLY. WE HAD- WHEN WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE IN ORDER TO PROTECT PROPERTY TO PROTECT FAMILIES FROM LOSING EVERYTHING- OWNED IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. WHAT IS THIS WAS THE POWERSHOT OFFICE AND WE TOOK THE MODEL OF SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. WHICH HE DONE A FABULOUS JOB. OF IMPLEMENTING YES YES ALL SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. IN DOING IN A MANNER THAT WAS RESPONSIVE. I TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. ANY WAS RESPONSIVE TO- YEP FRANKLY THEY DID IT- FOR THEIR OWN LIABILITY BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THEY HAD ISSUES TO THAT THEY HAD NOT MAINTAIN THEIR LIVES WELL ENOUGH IT'S SO OVER THAT TIME IT'S BEEN A REAL DE ESCALATE OZONATION- PS PS IS IN. SAN DIEGO AS RESULT OF DOING IT RIGHT. SO WHAT SET FAST FORWARD WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE. AND HOW THIS HAS REARED ITS UGLY HEAD MOSTLY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA I THINK THERE'S SOME POCKETS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OF PS PS IS THAT HAVE GONE AWRY BUT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE A AND- THE WEATHER PATTERNS WE HAD IT CETERA LEARN MORE. YES VI&lt;c.cyan&gt;. DONE IT VIEW. WE HAD A&lt;/c&gt; UTILITY AND CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO DO PSP ESSES IN A VERY IRRESPONSIBLE WAY. VERY HERE RESPONSIBLE WAY AND THEN AS A RESULT OF THEM NOT IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THEY COULDN'T SAID MAC COMMUNITIES SO THEY NEEDED JUST AS FAR AS THEY WERE CONCERNED TURN OFF THIRTY COUNTIES. THE TRANSFER THE LIABILITIES THEY'RE ALIVE OWN LIABILITIES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND SO THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE WE HAVE THE CPUC DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IT I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS UNTIL CENTER BRADFORD BROUGHT IT UP. MY GOOD FRIEND BUT NEVER THE LESS- I REALLY AM PLEASED WITH THIS HEARING TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB. I KNOW THE HEARING START OVER BUT AT LEAST FOR THIS PANEL- THE PRESIDENT BADGER- YOU AND YOUR TEAM HAVE BEEN DOING AMAZING JOB IMPLEMENTING A LOT OF VERY VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK I'M GRATEFUL. FOR THE WORK THAT IS BEEN DONE I LOOK FORWARD TO- CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU- LONG INTO THE FUTURE OR AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT FOUR AND A HALF YEARS. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD AND TO ADD A LITTLE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE TO YOUR COMMENTS BACK IN- BUT I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AROUND TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN- TESTED YOU NEED. DID BEGIN. THE SHUT OFFS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO. THEY WERE ACTUALLY ASKING FOR THAT THEY WERE BUILDING SUPPORT IN THE COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY DO THAT SO. FAR UTILITIES BEST- ACTUALLY REQUESTED TO BE ALLOWED TO THE SHUT OFF SO. I THINK IT IT HAS WORKED WELL FOR SAN DIEGO. AND I THINK AS THE JEWS BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF EXECUTING BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT AS THE COMMISSIONER STATED IT'S ALL ABOUT EXECUTION IT'S ALL ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. ONE FINAL QUESTION TO THE COMMISSION I HAVE A COPY OF- THE TWENTY NINETEEN ANNUAL REPORT. AND FOR THOSE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT DON'T HAVE A COPY OF IT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT THE P.

THANK THE P. YOU SEE FOR EXPANDING CIRCLE THE SOLAR POWER FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS IN PARTICULAR PROVIDE PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO REDUCE THE COST OF PEAS. PEAVEY OR PHOTOVOLTAIC INSTALLATIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND MAKES IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS. ALSO WANT TO THANK THE P. YOU SEE FOR THEIR WORK IN TNC ACCESS FOR ALL SOMETHING THAT TO AN AREA THAT WE WORKED IN HERE.

UPDATE TODAY AND- TODAY. WE WILL BE-JOINED BY- ELIZABETH ECKELS SO SHE'S- THE DIRECTOR OF THIS OFFICER WAS FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE OFFICE OF REPAIR. ADVOCATES AND- BUSINESSES- ECKELS. AVAILABLE ONLINE NOW. IN THE FULLER SHE IS A THE CIRCLES WELCOME WELCOME TO OUR COMMITTEE AND- WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN PRESENTING PLEASE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN HIKES AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY- AS YOU KNOW MY NAME IS ELIZABETH TACKLES AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THESE UNPRECEDENTED AND DIFFICULT TIMES AND I ALSOVERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THESE DAYS BRING TODAY. I WITH ME I'M VIRTUALLY ARE MY IDENTITY FOR ENERGY LINDA SERIZAWA. MAKE CHIEF COUNSEL DARMAN FOR OUR- DOCTOR NOT SKINNER WHO'SOUR MANAGER FOR OUR SAFETY BRANCH AND ANNA MARIE AND JOHNSON OUR MANAGER FOR OUR WATER. AND COMMUNICATIONS POLICY BRANCH- AND- I BELIEVE YOU ALL HAVE MY REASON TATIAN- AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ALREADY AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE SLIDES AND WANT TO MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIME. AND THAT BRIEFLY DO IS QUICKLY YOU ON THE SAVINGS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS LAST YEAR ACROSS INDUSTRY AREAS ENERGY WATER AND COMMUNICATIONS. AND THEN PROVIDE YOU WITH A FEW SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF OUR WORK TO ADDRESS THAT FINANCIAL IMPACT SIMPLE IN NINETEEN ON UTILITY CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS TO PROTECT CUSTOMERS FROM WILDFIRES AND UNNECESSARY POWER SHUT OFF. AS YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS THE INDEPENDENT CONSUMER ADVOCATE AT THE CPUC. OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE LOWEST POSSIBLE UTILITYRATES FOR CALIFORNIANS. CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY RELIABILITY AND THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL HOLES. WE PROVIDE A VOICE FOR MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS MANY OF WHOM DO NOT HAVE THE TIME OR RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THE STATE'S COMPLEX PROCESS IT'S- LAST YEAR OUR DEDICATED TEAM OF ANALYSTS ENGINEERS AND ATTORNEYS FILED NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED PLEADINGS IN CPSC PROCEEDINGS. PARTICIPATED IN HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC MEETINGS AND WORKED WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATE FOR CUSTOMERS BEFORE THE CPC AND IN OTHER FORMS. AND OUR HARD WORK PAID OFF LAST YEAR WE SAVE CUSTOMERS MORE THAN FOUR POINT THREE BILLION IN LOWER UTILITY REVENUES AND AVOIDED RATE INCREASES. MOST OF THE FOUR POINT THREE BILLION IN SAVINGS IS THE RESULT OF OUR ADVOCACY IN TEN GENERAL RATE CASES I ALSO NOTICED YEAR SEES WHICH ARE LISTED IN MY PRESENTATION. THE G. A. R. C. IS OUR UTILITY REQUESTED THE CPC FOR RATE PAYER MONEY TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES. OFTENTIMES WITH ONLY PARTY TO EVALUATE THESE PROPOSALS IN THEIR ENTIRETY OUR ADVOCACY HELPS TO KEEP COSTS DOWN BY IDENTIFYING AREAS WHERE THE UTILITIES ARE REQUESTING MORE MONEY THE NECESSARY TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESS IS SAFELY. HOW PAY FOR AND EXPECT STATE AND RELIABLE ENERGY WATER AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES THIS IS WHY THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WITH THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. HAS INCREASED OUR EMPHASIS ON SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF OUR WORK RELATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY SPECIFICALLY OF THE NINETEEN WILDFIRES. FIRST WOMAN KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC BEGAN WITH QUICKLY RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HARDSHIP CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE GOING TO FACE WE IDENTIFIED SOME KEY AREAS WHERE THE CPU SECRET ACT TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF. WE STARTED BY RECOMMENDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CLIENT MAKE CREDITS TO RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS BE MOVED UP. IN MARCH WE FILED AN EMERGENCY MOTION URGING THE CPC TO REQUIRE KEY JEANNIE AND ESSIE NEED TO DISTRIBUTE THE OCTOBER CLIMATE CREDIT IN MAY OR JUNE- SDG NEED REST YOU DO NEED THE TWENTY TWENTY CLIMATE CREDIT TIME MEAN. WAS ALREADY ADJUSTED TO MELIORATE ANTICIPATED HIGH BILLS. WE ALSO RECOMMENDED IN DISTRIBUTING THE TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE CLIMBING CREDITS IN TWENTY TWENTY IN ANTICIPATION OF. ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AT LEAST THROUGH THIS SUMMER IN BEYOND. THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN THREE MONTHS AND EXPEDITING BILL RELIEF FOR CUSTOMERS AT P. JEANNIE AND ESSIE AND TWO MONTHS FOR ESTA JEANNIE CUSTOMERS TO. AS YOU HEARD FROM PRESIDENT THAT YOU'RE THAT SI PC ACTED SWIFTLY AND MOVE THE CLIMATE CREDITS FROM THIS FALL TO EARLIER IN THE YEAR FOR P. JEANNIE AND C. E. C. P. C. DECLINED TO DISTRIBUTE THAT ESTIMATED TWENTY TWENTY ONE CLAIMING CREDIT AT THIS TIME. WE RECOMMENDED SIMILAR ACTIONS FOR LIBERTY AND PACIFIC FOR WHICH THE CPC ADOPTED LAST WEEK THE RESULT IS THAT CUSTOMERS WILL RECEIVE CLIMATE CREDITS RANGING FROM THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS TO A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS. FOR PACIFIC QUIRK CUSTOMERS THIS IS A RELATIVELY SIMPLE APPROACH THAT GIVES CUSTOMERS SOME FINANCIAL RELIEF WHILE NOT CREATING AND DEBT BURDEN FOR FUTURE CUSTOMERS. NEXT TO FURTHER. ASSIST CUSTOMERS SUFFERING FROM THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF PROBING NINETEEN WE ADVOCATED FOR THE ENERGY UTILITIES TO IMMEDIATELY FROM ALL PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS BILL OR REAR AGES AND PREVENT HIS CONNECTIONS. AS YOU KNOW WITH THE LOSS OF JOBS CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME PAYING BILLS AND ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THEIR UNPAID BILL BALANCES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. LONG BEFORE THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE WERE ALREADY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PREVENTING AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SERVICE DISCONNECTIONS. IN THIS WORK IS ONLY INCREASED IN URGENCY WITH OF COURSE THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN. AND THAT MAKE. THE PROPOSED PROGRAM HELPS TO AVOID DISCONNECTIONS BY ALLOWING FOR A BILL OR REAR EACH FORGIVENESS AS LONG AS THE CUSTOMER WORKS WITH THE UTILITY ON A SCHEDULE TO PAY A PORTION OF THE REAR AGES. THE PROGRAM ALSO BENEFITS ALL CUSTOMERS BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THE UTILITY WOULD HAVE TO WRITE OFF ACROSS WHICH TYPICALLY WOULD BE ABSORBED BY ALL CUSTOMERS. IN MAY THE CPUC ISSUED A PROPOSED DECISION IN THE DISCONNECTION PROCEEDING AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THAT AND IT REARED SHOULD MANAGEMENT PLAN IT'S ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THAT. PROPOSED DECISION. IS DIFFICULT IS CONTINUE TO MOUNT FOR CUSTOMERS WITH URGE THE CPC TO MAINTAIN ITS FOCUS ON ELECTRIC RATE INCREASES AND AS YOU HEARD FROM PRESIDENT BADGER THE INCREASES IN ELECTRIC RATES IN BILLS IT'S TRULY ALARMING. FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE PAST DECADE ESTY GENIES RESIDENTIAL AVERAGE RATE HAS INCREASED 24% FASTER THAN INFLATION IN P. GENIES RATES HAVE OUTPACED INFLATION BY TWENTY SIX PERCENT. AND NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCED EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. GIVEN THE EXPECTED INCREASES IN COST COMING FROM WILD FIRE MITIGATION IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE NOT ONLY THE RATE INCREASES FROM THOSE ACTIVITIES BUT THE COMBINED EFFECT OVER YEARS. IT'LL BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE CLEAR AND TARGETED PRIORITIES THE FOCUS ON REDUCING GHG WHILE PROVIDING SAFE AND RELIABLE ENERGY AT REASONABLE PRICES. IN A VARIETY OF PROCEEDINGS MY OFFICE HAS WORKED TO INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECT OF PARTICULAR UTILITY. RATES ARE PARTICULAR YOU TELL YOUR QUEST ON OVERALL RATES NOT JUST. IN ISOLATION IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE THESE PROPOSED INCREASES WHEN THEY'RE COMBINED WITH OTHER ANTICIPATED UTILITY REVENUE INCREASES. DO WE SEE A NEED FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN THAT RATE MAKING PROCESS AS WELL AS BETTER TOOLS THE CPC TO IDENTIFY THE TRADE OFFS IN MAKING WHEN AN APPROVED NEW UTILITY AND THE- TO HELP WITH THAT WE PROPOSED. A TOOL THAT HELPS TO CONSIDER HOW EACH REQUEST FURTHERS. THE INTEREST OF LOOKING FORWARD ACROSS VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS AND HOW THEY CAN INNER ACTED CHANGE CUSTOMERS RATES. THE TOOL THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED. AND THAT BOTH THE ENERGY UTILITIES AND SI PC SI PC CAN USE PROVIDES A SIMPLE AND COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO SEE HOW YES PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS COMBINED TO DRIVE FREE. THE TOOL IS INTENDED TO BE FORWARD LOOKING AND RATHER THAN REVIEW A PARTICULAR YOU CHILI PROPOSAL IN ISOLATION ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE QUEUE IN A TEN IMPACTS FOR THE COMING YEARS. NEXT TURNING TO WILD FOR SAFETY AND PREVENTION AS A CHAIR HI SO MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS. TWO MILLION CUSTOMERS LOST POWER DURING LAST FALL'S PS PS EVENTS. MANY CUSTOMERS ALSO LOST ACCESS TO COMMUNICATION NETWORKS DURING THESE POWER SHUT OFF. BECAUSE MORE THAN 81% AND NINE ONE ONE CALLS ARE MADE FROM CELL PHONES THE RESILIENCY OF WIRELESS NETWORKS IT'S A MATTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. ACT OVER TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARE SENT US COUPLED WITH KOBE NINETEEN HAVE HIGHLIGHTED HOW CRITICAL AN ESSENTIAL COMMUNICATION NETWORKS ARE FOR WIRELESS AND WIRELINE SERVICES. WITH THE CPC TO EXERCISE ITS AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE WIRELESS COMPANIES TO INSTALL BACKUP POWER IN THEIR FACILITIES. AND TO INCLUDE ALL MEANS NECESSARY TO ENSURE A WIRE SERVICE IS MAINTAINED FOR AT LEAST SEVENTY TWO HOURS FROM THE START OF AN ELECTRICAL OUTAGE. ESPECIALLY NOW TO THE KOBE NINETY. THANK CALIFORNIANS RELYING. COMMUNICATION SERVICES. FOR ALMOST EVERY FOR TELEWORK FOR VISIT THEIR DOCTOR ATTENDING SCHOOL SIGNING UP FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS APPLYING FOR JOBS AND- MOST IMPORTANTLY THE NEED TO DIAL NINE ONE ONE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. I WANT TO COMMEND THE CPC FOR ISSUING PROPOSED RULES REQUIRING COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TAKE ALLMEANS NECESSARY TO KEEP SERVICE WORKING DURING A POWER SHUT OFF AND OTHER DISASTERS. WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT AS RULES CAN BE ADOPTED QUICKLY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS. IT'S CRITICAL FOR COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES STAFF ON SITEBACKUP POWER WE CAN'T RELY AND DEPLOY WHAT ASSETS SECTIONS CELLS ON WHEELS OURSELVES ON LIKE TRACKS TO RESPOND TO WIDESPREAD OUTAGES YEARS NO WHERE NEAR ENOUGH OF THESE TO PLAY WELL. ASSETS TO PREVENT. WINDS REACHING TWO CASES NETWORK OUTAGES. FINALLY WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN REVIEWING THE ELECTRIC UTILITIES TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR MEDICATION PLANTS AND PROVIDING COMMENTS IN OUR REVIEW OF THE PLANS FILED BY THE SIX INVESTOR OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITIES P. JEANNIE S. C. E. . T. G. ANY CENTER COURT WHERE VALLEY AND LIBERTY WE IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY OF THE PLANSIN PARTICULAR WE I DONT AGAIN IF I SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH P. GENIES PLAN WHICH WOULD REQUIRE PEACHY NEED TO FILE A FULL COMPLIANCE PLAN IN TWENTY TWENTY. ONE IS IT SAMPLE. P. JEANNIE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ITS PLANNED SYSTEM HARDENING EMISSIONS. ALSO FAILED TO PROVIDE RISK SPEND EFFICIENCY WHICH ARE A CRITICAL TOOL TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE OVERALL ADVOCACY AT THE UTILITY SAFETY PROGRAMS. THE HIGHER THE RISK SPEND EFFICIENCY CORNER SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENT THE MORE BENEFICIAL IT IS TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE CONDUCT THE ACTIVITY. THE WATER IS DIVISION AND OTHER PARTIES ALSO HAVE BEEN COVERED SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES IN THE PLANS THEREFORE WE RECOMMEND THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SOME UTILITYSHOULD BE REQUIRED TO FILE. THREE COUNTS OF PLANTS INSTEAD OF JUST PROVIDING UPDATES TO THEIR TWENTY TWENTY PLANS. OVERALL THE TWENTY TWENTY WATER MITIGATION PLANS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD IN THE OVERSIGHT OF ELECTRIC. UTILITY OPERATIONS AND THAT PROCESS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOW BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY UR NEW DIRECTOR OVER THE WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION IS LEADING TO INCREASED. TRANSPARENCY HOWEVER EVEN WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE COLLEAGUES AT THE CPC AND COUNSEL COUNTLESS STATE LOCAL AND OTHER ENTITIES CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO A SIGNIFICANT WILD HER AND OTHER SAFETY THREATS. MY GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND INNOVATIVE THINKING TO ACHIEVE SOLUTIONS THAT BENEFIT CALIFORNIA AND ITS CONSUMERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND IF MEMBERS HAVE A QUESTIONS PLEASE RAISE YOUR HANDS NOW. RUBIO I JUST A THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST TO ADDRESS KIND OF THE GROWING CONCERN ABOUT UTILITY SHUT OFFS. AND WE PASSED A BILL TO HELP PEOPLE WITH A LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS AND- WE THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A TRIP THERE'S BEEN A TREND A GROWING TREND OF PEOPLE BEING DISCONNECTED FROM- UTILITY SERVICE FOR. OF LACK OF PAYMENT. AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR- PERSPECTIVES ON THAT ISSUE ARE THERE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN YOUR OFFICE THAT WOULD LIKE TO HELP CUSTOMERS- STRUGGLING TO PAY THE UTILITY BILLS SO THAT SOMETHING YOU CONSIDERED SOMETHING YOU'VE LOOKED AT. HI THIS IS SIX. YES YES YES ABSOLUTELY- THAT AND THAT IS ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT THAT WE HAVE BEFORE THE PC TO SPECIFICALLY. HAVE A DOCTOR PLAN WHERE THE UTILITIES CAN WORK- WITH THE CUSTOMER- SO THAT THEY'RE AND THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE NOT DISCONNECTED AND THAT THE- VARIOUS- REAR AGES THAT THE CUSTOM MAY HAVE CAN BE PAID IN SMALL AMOUNTS GOING FORWARD. WHICH WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT THAT CUSTOMER AND PREVENT THAT CUSTOMER FROM BEING- DISCONNECTED BUT WILL ALSO- NOT. AND TO THE COST OF THAT HAVE A DISCONNECTION BECAUSE THE DISCONNECTION IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND TRAGIC FOR THE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AND IT GETS A LOT OF MONEY IN AND HASSLE TO GET RECONNECTED. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT- IT IF THERE ARE A LOT OF DISCONNECTIONS THAT ADDS TO THE COST OF ALL OF THE CUSTOMERS BECAUSE- IT'S ULTIMATELY THE CUSTOMERS THAT ABSORB THOSE THOSE COSTS SO. IT'S IN A IS INTEREST TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN THE PEOPLE. DID TO THEIR UTILITY SERVICE BOTH FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY BUT ALSO FOR THE BROADER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO SENATOR MORE LOCK. MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU MISS ECKELS- REVIEWING YOUR POWER POINT PRESENTATION- ON PAGE THREE WE ARE TOLD THAT. YOU WERE ABLE TO SAVE A FOUR POINT JUST TRYING TO BALANCE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AND I OWE YOU AND CHAPTER ELEVEN WE HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS AND WE HAVE. FIRE VICTIMS THAT NEED REIMBURSEMENT SINCE SO I'M I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT IS SIR PAGE THAT HELPS US. TO UNDERSTAND THE BALANCE- SO THAT AS WE PURSUE AFFORDABILITY WERE NOT BEING PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH AND- I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME OUT. YEAH IN IN OUR FULL REPORT WHICH HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE THERE AS WELL IT SHOULD EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL- HOW. WHAT WAS DONE AND WHERE SOME OF THOSE COSTS AND IT'S COST SAVINGS WERE FOUND SO FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO BE CLEAR- WE STRONGLY AS AS ADVOCATES FOR CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS WANT THE UTILITIES TO INVEST IN SAFETY AND WE WERE IN SOME OF THE MEMBERS HERE KNOW YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THIS TO WE WERE INSTRUMENTAL. IN HELPING SET UP A PROCESS WHERE PRIOR TO AND THEN GENERATE CASES WE WOULD WE ALL OF THE PARTIES WOULD FOCUS ON THE VARIOUS SAFETY RISKS AND ASSESS WHAT THE SAFETY RISKS WORK. MOST CRITICAL TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT AWAY- AND THEN WE WOULD TALK ABOUT COSTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SEPARATE OUT YOU KNOW THE SAFETY FROM COSTED. TO LOOK AT WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO ADDRESS ON TO A NEW ADDRESS A SAFETY ISSUE SO WE'RE NOT ASKING THIS THAT THE UTILITIES TO NOT DO WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE ON. FOR TO SAVE MONEY BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE. ANYONE HAS COME FOOLISH I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT- BUT BUT INSTEAD THERE THERE MAY BE WHAT WE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY BE ONE UTILITY WILL SAY OKAY IT'LL COST US. THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY TO ADDRESS THE SAFETY ISSUE AND ANOTHER UTILITY MIGHT SAY OH IT'S GOING TO COST US YOU KNOW X. VERSES Y. AMOUNT AND SO WE ARE OR LET'S JUST SAY YOU KNOW THREE TIMES AS MUCH FOR THE SAME TYPE OF WORK WE WOULD WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT IS DRIVING THAT DISCREPANCY SO WHY IS IT THAT ONE UTILITY CAN DO IT SO MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVELY THAN THE OTHER. FOR THE SAME QUALITY WORK AND SO THOSE ARE THE KIND TACTIC ENQUIRIES THAT WE LOOK AT WE ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE- IN THE PAST SO IF WE HAVE IF WE HAVE. IF YOU TELL IS IN AND BEEN AUTHORIZED MONEY AND GENERATE CASE TO DO CERTAIN WORK- BUT THEN SOMETIMES THEY WILL COME BACK IN THE NEXT YEAR SEE. AND ASK FOR MONEY TO DO THAT WORK AGAIN OUR LEASE DO PART OF THAT WORK. AND SO WE WILL BE ASKED. OKAY ALREADY GAVE YOU. THAT SO ARE. YOU SEE DEAD SO WAR WAS THAT MY NIECE WAS IT'S AN APPROPRIATELY- YOU KNOW WHY DO YOU NEED THIS NEW MONEY. AND THEN WE MIGHT ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE. YOU KNOW AT INCENTIVE PLANS ARE OR BONUSES FOR YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE MIGHT THINK THAT ARE. OUT OF PROPORTION WITH WITH WHAT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE GIVEN- SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WORK WERE ABSOLUTELY NOT WANTING TO. ADD SAFETY OR CERTAINLY TO CUT PROGRAMS THAT CAN. ASSIST ARE. VULNERABLE THANK YOU THANK YOUR. THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO- INTEREST I GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON SEVENTEEN TO EVERY SAY THE CPC APPROVED JOB THE MERGER BETWEEN SPRINT ANDT. MOBILE. SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE STANCE ON THIS ISSUE AND- WERE THERE ANY CONCERNS THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED BY YOUR OFFICE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR FOR ASKING THAT QUESTION- WE DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE MERGER WE OPPOSE THE MERGER. ON LARGELY BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SAW WERE. ANTI COMPETITIVE EFFECTS WE ARE MY STAFF. VERY CLOSELY AT WHAT THE MERGER WITH DO AND- PARTICULARLY IN AREAS FOR A LOWER INCOME CUSTOMERS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON PREPAID PLANS AND WAT WE SAW IS THAT IF THOSE TWO COMPANIES COMBINED THERE WOULD BE. VIRTUALLY NO COMPETITION IN IN THOSE AREAS AND SO THAT WASN'T A BIG REASON WHY WE OPPOSE THE MERGE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING. THAT TIME MR CHECK THANK YOU GO TO SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TAKING RECESS TACKLES FOR- FOR YOUR YEARS OF WORK. WHAT A VARIETY OF FRIENDS IN YOUR OFFICE- MY QUESTION WAS- BUILT OFF THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ANNUAL REPORT AND REALLY APPRECIATED THE- FOCUS- ON THE INVESTIGATION INTO SO CAL GASES. MISMANAGEMENT IDEALLY SO CANYON STORAGE FACILITY AND YOUR SUGGESTIONS AROUND- ENERGY SAFETY CULTURE. OVER ALL I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE I KNOW THIS FEELS LIKE AND DISTANT MEMORY FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS IN U. S. HISTORY SO THE MEMORY STILL RAW AND PEOPLE ARE STILL HURTING I'M JUST WONDERING. HAVE YOU YET. ESTIMATED V. NOT THE HEALTH IMPACT BUT THE RATE IMPACT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FROM. THE FAILURES AT THAT STORAGE FACILITY HOW MUCH HAS. THE BLOW OUT CLOSER AND SUBSEQUENT CONSTRAINTS IMPACTED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS. YEAH SO I'M GOING TO LET MY- BRANCH MANAGER FOR SAFETY ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION- IT. COULD NOT DO YOU WANT TO JUMP AND YOU WANT TO RAISE YOUR HAND THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BE CALLED AND I'M NOT. POSITIVE HOW THIS WORKS NO THAT'S FINE SHE THE THEY CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION. ARE THEY AVAILABLE. I'M NOT. MAKE HE MAY HAVE TO RAISE HIS HAND IN THE CHAT SO THAT THAT. THE OTHER FOLKS AND THE I. T. FOLKS WHEN IN INTO THAT PAN AWAY ON ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME NOW CAN OPENER MIKE PLEASE. IF THEY CAN IF THEY CAN SPEAK TO. THAT ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME SENATOR YES YES THE RIVER THAT IS CERTAINLY INFORMATION THAT WE CAN LOOK UP AND GET TO YOU. THANK YOU AND ANY FOR ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS ON OVERALL THE SAFETY CULTURE AND- THE- YOUR VIEWS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FIELD. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING INTO BOTH AS PART OF THE ONLY SO CANYON INVESTIGATION WHICH IS ONGOING WE'VE PROVIDED TESTIMONY. IN THAT PROCEEDING AND WE WILL ALSO BE VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE SAFETY CULTURE INVESTIGATION- THE COMMISSION INITIATED THAT PROCEEDING LAST YEAR- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THEY'VE HIRED CONSULTANTS I'M NOT PROCEEDING SHOULD RESUME ONCE THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR REPORT. LIKELY WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU. SENATOR STERN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE WE DON'T HAVE THAT ON THE TIP OF OUR FINGERS BUT WE WILL GET WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU FOR THAT WITH THAT THANKS VERY MUCH VERY WELL THANK YOU BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION APPRECIATED VERY MUCH AND I ALSO APPRECIATE. THE WORK YOU DO ON- SAVING REPAIRS- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IS JUST SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO. NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PART OF OUR AGENDA WILL BE HEARING FROM. THE THREE LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITIES. ALL THREE UTILITIES HAVE PROVIDED COPIES pWHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN THE SENATE. ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE WEBSITE. ALL THIS INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND ON. THE SENATE ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE WEBSITE INCLUDING. THE ANNUAL REPORTS- SO I WE COURTS THE PUBLIC LET'S LISTEN IN AND TO VISIT OUR WEBSITE IF YOU WANT TO SEE ANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS WITH THE INFORMATION. WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN. WITH SAID IT WILL GAS AND ELECTRIC. WE HAVE BRANDY AUGUSTINE ALL HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE. ADAPTATION DIVISION OF THAT THIS UTILITY. IS MISTER DOUGLAS TINO ONLINE OTHER AREAS OKAY EAT WELL YES I AM- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMITTEE MEMBERS- AS THE CHAIRMAN MENTIONED. METEOROLOGIST I GUESS YOU KNOW THAT AFTER A FIRE SCIENCE AN- ADAPTATION PRESTIGE JEANNIE AND I. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME WITH HERE TODAY. TALK ABOUT HOW WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT. AT ESTY JEANNIE. HOW WE ARE EXECUTING ON OUR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN THIS YEAR- HOW WE ARE PREPARING FOR PS PS. AND THEN DOING ALL OF THIS WELL REALLY KEEPING AN EYE ON THE SAFETY OF OUR- EASY AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE SERVING. IN LIGHT- OF KOBE NINETEEN SO I WOULD INVITE YOU TO FOLLOW ALONG. AS I MENTIONED I. YOU DO A COPY OF THE- PRESENTATION. WANTED JUST BY TAKING A LOOK AT THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRE SEASON OUTLOOK- WE DID SEE SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL FORTUNATELY IN OUR WATER YEAR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- LAST WINTER JUST UP UNTIL A COUPLE MONTHS AGO EVEN WITH SOME RECORD RAINFALL. HERE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN APRIL AS A RESULT- WE'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME LEVEL OF DROUGHT THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING EXPERIENCED IN SOME OF THE NORTHERN. PARTS OF THE STATE- AND BECAUSE OF THIS THE OFFICIAL FIRE AGENCY FORECAST RIGHT NOW ARE FOR BELOW NORMAL POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT FIRE ACTIVITIES THROUGH AUGUST. THAT SAD GRASS FIRES HAVE STARTED ACROSS OUR REGION WE HAD SEVERAL- JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS- THOUGH THEY ARE STILL SAYING SMALL. ALL THAT FAR BELOW TEN ACRES- IN THOSE ARE BEING BECAUSE JUST ON ROADSIDES AND- OTHER NORMAL DAY TO DAY ACTIVITY BUT WE DO EXPECT THOSE WILL INCREASE IN SIZE AND FREQUENCY AS WE HEAD THROUGH- THE UP COMING SUMMER MONTHS- AND THEN AS WE MOVE TOWARDS LATE IN THE SUMMER AND THE FALL. THAT IS WHEN WE EXPECT TO THAT ALL OF OUR FUELS WILL AGAIN BE VERY DRY AND WE ARE ANTICIPATING- RED FLAG WARNINGS AS WE HEAD INTO THIS FALL. SO AS WE- I'M WE ARE AD WE ARE AS PREPARED AS WE'VE EVER BEEN. WE HAVE BEEN AT THIS NOW FOR OVER A DECADE WHERE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE REST ACROSS OUR TERRITORY AND OVER A DECADE AGO WE HAD AN APPROACH WHERE WE WOULD FOCUS ON FINDING THE HIGHEST RISK AREA OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. IN A LOT OF CASES THAT COULD BE OLDER INFRASTRUCTURE SOME HAD SMALLER WIRE AND BEING A METEOROLOGIST WE WOULD IDENTIFY THE WINDIEST AREAS AND WE WOULD HARDEN AT FIRST. THIS APPROACH HAS PROVEN SUCCESSFUL- ESSENTIAL TO THE SAFETY OF OUR REGION I MEAN WE CONTINUE THAT APPROACH TO THIS DAY- SO WORK NEW WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS HAVE A NEW RENEWED EFFORT. AND THIS IS REALLY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE WITH TIME THE IMPACT THAT PUBLIC SAFETY OUR SHOPS- HAVE ON THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. AND WE'RE DOING THAT IN A FEW DIFFERENT- WAYS IN WITH A NEW. SENSE OF PROGRAMS- ACROSS ONE MORE WEATHER STATIONS BUT ALL OF THOSE WEATHER STATIONS ARE COUPLED TO NEW SECTIONAL ICING DEVICES SO THAT WE CAN MAKE. PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF SMALLER AND MORE TARGETED- WE ARE IMPLEMENTING MULTIPLE GENERATOR PROGRAMS. THOSE ARE WORKING ALONG WITH THE S. CHIP PROGRAM AND WE'RE TRYING TO TARGET FOLKS THAT ARE NOT ABLE. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN GET. STATE OF RATIONING THE HAN OF HIS OF OUR- IS ALSO. TO DECREASE THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OFFICE. MICROGRAPHS ARE BEING DEPLOYED IN VERY STRATEGIC AREAS ACROSS OUR BACK COUNTRY AND AGAIN THAT IS TO BRING POWER IN CHECK AREAS WHERE MAYBE THAT- CIRCUIT. RUNS THROUGH VERY STRONG WINDS TO GET THERE SO WE SECTION HONESTY AND IN THE NEWS MIKE REGRETS TO POWER THOSE AREAS. AND ALL OF THIS WORK IS HAVING AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT. ON WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE OUR P. S. P. S. IMPACT IN TWENTY TWENTY. OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS SB JEANNIE BROUGHT TOGETHER A TEAM OF STOCK LEADERS ACROSS THE COMPANY USER LEADERS FROM FIRE SCIENCE TEAM FROM THE ENGINEERING TEAM. FROM THE CUSTOMER OUTREACH TEAM WERE ALL GETTING TOGETHER WITH A COMMON PURPOSE OF HOW DO WE MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF P. S. P. S. THIS YEAR. AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS- IF WE SAW THE SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT WE SAW ARMED TWENTY NINETEEN. WE EXPECT ABOUT A 30% DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED TO THIS YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THAT 30% DECREASE IN CUSTOMERS IMPACTED WE ALSO ARE ANTICIPATING IN THE SAME OF ACT SIX LAST SCHOOLS WOULD BE IMPACTED. THREE LAST FIRE STATIONS IN FORTY SEVEN. CAN SITES ALONG WITH SIX WATER FACILITIES- AND THAT'S JUST BY THE BEGINNING OF THIS UPCOMING FIRE SEASON THOSE NUMBERS INCREASE BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND THEN CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE YEARS TO COME AS WE CONTINUE. TO BUILD OUT THIS PROGRAM. TRANSITIONING OVER TO SITUATIONAL WARENESS THIS IS BEEN A FOUNDATIONAL COMPONENT OF OUR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PROGRAM OVER THE LAST DECADE IT'S REALLY HELPED US UNDERSTAND THE RISKS SO THAT WE CAN TARGET. ARE MEDICATIONS IN A VERY FOCUSED WAY AND WE ARE IMPLEMENTING FIRE SAFE THREE POINT OH WHICH IS OUR NEXT GENERATION OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TO SUPPORT OUR FIRE MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. SOME OF THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THIS YEAR INCLUDE THIRTY SECOND RECORDING CAPABILITY FROM. HIGHER WHETHER NETWORK WOULD YOU BE PASSING OVER TWO HUNDRED STATE IS THIS YEAR. AS WE HEARD EARLIER FROM THE WILD FIRE SAFETY DIVISION WE ARE IMPLEMENTING A- SATELLITE WILD FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM. BEING DONE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. WE ARE LEVERAGING TEN YEARS OF WEATHER DATA OVER A BILLION OBSERVATIONS RIGHT NOW TO TRAIN A AYE BASED MODELS TO GET EXTREMELY PRECISE WEATHER FORECAST FOR THOSE AREAS MOST PRONE TO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOT OFF. THIS HELPS US TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH CUSTOMERS- AND PROVIDE THE DATA CORPORATE AMOUNT OF COMMUNICATION- AND SEAT BACK OR PSP S. PROCESS. WE'RE BUILDING OUT ON THE CAMERA NETWORKS AND SHARING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION OF COURSE WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES. PARTICULAR FOCUS HAS BEEN SUCH AN ORANGE COUNTY- WHERE WE TAX FOR NEW CAMERAS ALREADY INSTALLED SO FAR IN GETTING IT THIS YEAR TO SUPPORT. BUYERS TO RACIAL AWARENESS ACROSS THAT COURSE OF OURS TO. WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD STRONG ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE SAN JOSE STATE THE SAN DIEGO SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER AND SCRIPTS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY AND THESE PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO MOVE FIRE SCIENCE FORWARD ESTABLISHMENT DATA SHARE SO ANY INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE FROM OUR FIRE SCIENCE PROFESSIONALS ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERY RESEARCHER EVERY FIRE AGENCIES. EVERY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE FORECASTER ACROSS THE STATE. BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY OUT ON FUTURE P. S. P. S. IMPLEMENTATION AND THEN VERY IMPORTANTLY IT'S GOING TO HELP TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF FIRE SCIENTIST THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THESE ISSUES. AS WE MOVE INTO THE FUTURE. WE ARE NOT JUST ENHANCING OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS WE ARE ALSO ENHANCING. OUR AERIAL RESOURCES AND THAT SUPPORTS BOTH P. S. P. S. E. AND FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS. WE HAVE ADDED IN H. ONE THIRTY FIVE- WHICH IS A IN AIRBUS TO ENGINE HELICOPTER AND THAT COMPLIMENTS ARTS LEAD DIRECTLY TO SERVE AND TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY OUR SHOT OFFICE THIS HELICOPTER WILL HELP INSPECT LINES. FOR A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AND THEN IT WILL BE DEPLOYED AFTER THE WEATHER HAS SUBSIDED TO HELP RESTORE POWER IN THOSE AREAS MORE QUICKLY WE'VE ALSO ADDED A NEW BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER TO THE FLEET AND THAT IS GOING TO ELIMINATE ANY INTERRUPTION OF RESPONSE CAPABILITY DUE TO MAINTENANCE- ON OUR OTHER HELICOPTERS- SO WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE AERIAL RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY AND AGAIN ALL OF THESE FIRE MITIGATION HELICOPTERS ARE ALL AVAILABLE AND DISPATCHED BY COUNSEL JUST SUPPRESS ANY FIRES ACROSS SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WE HAVE BEEN VERY SPOKE ON THE IMPACT THAT COLGATE NINETEEN- AND PANDEMIC IS HAVING ON OUR OPERATIONS OUR TEAMS HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY I TO BE SAFE AND CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR EMPLOYEES BUT FOR THE COMMUNITIES SO WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING HEALTH SCREENINGS AT OUR OPERATION CENTERS. WE'VE BEEN DEPLOYING APPROPRIATE PP ACROSS- ALL OF OUR WORK FORCE YOU NEEDED AND SECUESTRO SYSTEM OPERATORS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ON SHIPS AND FOR A TIME WERE LIVING IN THE PARKING LOT- OF OUR OPERATIONS CENTER- SO THERE'S BEEN A REAL DEVOTED EFFORT- TO KEEPING RELIABLE AND SAFE ELECTRICITY. FOR SAN DIEGO- WITH REGARDS TO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF WE DID IMPLEMENTED A COMPANY WIDE GAP ANALYSIS TO. GO THROUGH AND DO A SURVEY FOR EVERY ORGANIZATION. THAT HAS PART IN A PSP ACTS WHICH IS A LOT EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE TAPPED. BE ASPECT OF IT MAKE SURE. THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SAFELY AND QUICKLY RESPOND HEY NOW WE'RE BUILDING TRAINING AND EXERCISES TO TEST THAT SO ALL EXERCISES ARE BEING DESIGNED FOR A COMPLEX BUT RITUAL EOC RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE INCIDENTS. NOT ONLY THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO P. R. E. S. AND ALSO THE REALITY THAT WILDFIRE CARS ON OUR LANDSCAPE THAT. TIME OF YEAR. OUR RIGHT NOW FOR ALL OF THOSE SENERE. AND WE MARK. TO DO A VERY CALM. OUT REACH WHERE ARE DOING LIVE WEBINARS IN WE'RE DOING THOSE EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS SUCH AS CAL FIRE THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS IN OUR COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS. TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A. COORDINATED COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. WE ARE SOME TALK ABOUT MY COMMUNITY RESOURCE EARLIER AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING HOW DO WE ADAPT OUR C. R. SEASON WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF CONTINGENCY PLANNING- SOME OF IT DOES INCLUDE THAT. THE CLEANING AND THE SOCIAL DISTANCING BUT THEN ALSO DIVERTING SOME OF THE TRAFFIC TO DRIVE THROUGH RESOURCES AND DATING WHAT WE OFFER TO OUR CUSTOMER WE FOUND SOLAR POWERED ATTERY CHARGERS- WE FOUND IN BURGERS THAT ENABLE YOU TO DRAW A LECTURER CITY OUT OF YOUR CAR BATTERY TO CHARGE THINGS LIKE YOUR PHONE. AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO HAND TO PEOPLE IN CARE PACKAGES AS THEY DRIVE THROUGH RATHER THAN HAVING TO BRING EVERYBODY IN THE CASE THAT WE ARE STILL. NOT FULLY SOCIAL DISTANCING AS WE GET INTO THAT ALL. WE'RE ALSO IMPLEMENTING DRIVE THRU WILDFIRE SAFETY FAIRS IN COLLABORATION WITH WILD FIRE STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE REGION- IN THOSE WILL BE TAKING PLACE. ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND LOCATIONS ACROSS OUR BACK COUNTRY- TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY REPAIR. THANK YOU AGAIN- MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE- AS WE MOVE INTO THE QUESTION PORTION- I'M PLEASED TO JOIN ASKED THE GENIE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT- HE'S ON THE CALL WITH US AS WELL THAT. GEAR AND THEN ALSO ESTY GENIES DIRECTOR OF WILD FIRE MITIGATION AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ON THAT JONATHAN ROLLED THE MERRIAM- AND WITH THAT THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY INFORMATIVE- PRESENTATION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE- INVESTMENTS ASEAN. HAS MADE. AN IN AN OF BEING BECOMING MORE RESPONSIVE TO WILDFIRES THEM. THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING I'VE I'VE WITNESSED IT I'VE- BEEN THERE TO DO KIND OF A OBSERVE. THE VIDEOS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE BY THE CAMERAS A CATCH THESE INCIDENTS AND THE FAST RESPONSES. THAT LEAD TO PUTTING UP THESE FIRES AND ESTROGEN IS DEFINITELY SERVE. AS A MODEL FOR OTHER UTILITIES ACROSS THE STATE PROBABLY PROGRESSIVE COUNTRY. IF THEY HAVE AREAS THAT ARE FACING THE THREAT OF THESE- DEVASTATING WILDFIRES THE WORK THAT HAS TO JUNE NEEDED. ACT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN EXTREMELY PIONEERING. AND I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE TEAM AS TO UNIQUE FOR ABOUT THE RESPONSIVENESS RECORDS SO. I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT THAT AT THIS TIME. IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE IN THE PANEL PARTICULAR THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE QUESTIONS WILL BEGIN WITH CENTER MORE LIKE FULL OF BY. CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND THANK YOU AB. MR D'AGOSTINO I JUST ON PAGE. I GUESS I DON'T HAVE A PAGE NUMBER- BUT IF FOLLOWS SHORTLY AFTER YOUR QUESTION SECTION- WILDFIRE RISK IN ES DE GENIES SERVICE AREA AND- THE SERVICE TERRITORY IS REFERRED TO AS H. FTD WHAT WHAT IS THAT ACRONYM STAND FOR. HI FIRESTAR WRAPPED DISTRICT- THE FIRE MAPPING EFFORTS CAME OUT OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION- AND IT WILL RATE ACT HERE TOO. AND HERE'S THREE- AREAS OF THE HIGH FIRES RIGHT DISTRICT HERE THREE- BEING THAT IT HAS THE HIGHEST FIRES RIGHT. THANK YOU AND THEN- THE QUESTION I HAD FOR MISS BOETTCHER IS. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT ADDRESSING YOUR AGING EQUIPMENT AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE- BUT- THE LA TIMES RECENTLY SAID THAT MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND FIRES IN THREE AND A HALF YEARS WERE CAUSED BY THE UTILITIES. I WOULD SUSPECT THAT A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THAT WOULD BE. IN YOUR AREA BUT WITH SO MUCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW WITH SHELTERING IN PLACE AND- I A THE QUESTION I HAD WAS WELL IF WE NOT ONLY HAD A SHOT FROM PLACE BUT IF WE LOST OUR ELECTRICITY. ARE THERE FOR LOSING. COLD STORAGE IN AND THE ABILITY TO RECHARGE OUR PHONES- FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD TIME- I JUST CURIOUS WHAT KIND OF. EXTREME EMERGENCY AND AS AS T. JEANNIE HAVE BEEN AND HOW WOULD I OBTAIN A COPY. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE- ON TKO- ESTY GENIES DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT- SAID ON MUTE AND- I JOIN AN IMPOSSIBLE. AND RUBIO ARE ARGUED YEAR THE DIRECTOR OVER TO SEE MANAGING FOR SDG ANY WE HAVE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE BLACKSTAR POLICY I AN STD ANY BAD RETAKES THE COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION ACROSS. A NUMBER OF OTHER UTILITIES AND AGENCIES TO AFFECT THE BULLY AND SAFELY BRING BE SYSTEM BACK UP TO BE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE SYSTEM WIDE. YEAH INCLUDES IN ANNUAL. WHERE WE GET TOGETHER WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DO THAT COLLABORATION AND ACTUALLY WATCH THAT THAT PLANNED SO THAT WHEN WE DO IF WE DO HAVE A SITUATION ARISE EVERYBODY KNOWS A ROLL EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY. AND IN FACT WE DID HAVE AN ACTUAL OF BAND IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WHERE ANY ISSUE HAPPENED IN NEW BUT THAT AFFECTED MEXICO PARTS OF ARIZONA IN OUR ENTIRE SERVICE TERRITORY AND THAT BLACK START POLICY CAME OUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS SO. FAMILIAR WITH THAT DO THE EXERCISES THAT LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE WERE ABLE TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY BRING BACK THE ENTIRE SAN DIEGO REACH- SO WE DO HAVE A POLICY IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE- IT IS IT IS EXERCISED ANNUALLY AND- AND WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU I AM I WOULD- GO BACK TO SEND DANGER SHARED RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE YOU SURE THAT YOU SERVE EIGHT AT LEAST EIGHTEEN ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOU WERE ABLE TO USE THAT TO A TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND IT WAS VERY COMPREHENSIVE MY QUESTION IS IF YOU CAN SHOW SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE YOU TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND REALLY TRANSLATED INTO ACTIONS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS. OF BILLS ORGANIZATIONS. YES AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE B. EIGHTEEN ORGANIZATIONS ARE ACTUALLY DEPARTMENTS WITHIN SDG AND EIGHTY. SO THAT THAT PARTICULAR SURVEY WHICH I WAS MENTIONING I'M WAS IN TROUBLE TO THE COMPANY IN THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASPECTS OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOPPING HOW WE- HOW WE END UP SERVING THE COMMUNITIES WHEN THAT HAPPENS MAKE SURE THAT ALL ASPECTS ARE ABLE TO BE CONDUCTED SAFELY- DURING SOCIAL DISTANCING. WHILE WORKING REMOTELY IN SOME CASES- SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE SURVEY THAT I WAS SPEAKING UP THERE- THAT BEING SAID WITH OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE WILD FIRE SAFETY FAIRS- IAN'S ARE ARE OPEN HOUSES WHICH ARE TOWN HALLS WHICH ARE NOW WILD WOMEN OURS THIS YEAR. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH FIRE SAFE COUNCILS COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS IN THE FIRE AGENCIES. TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK NOT JUST ON THE CONTENT AND HAVING A UNIFIED SHARED MESSAGE ON THAT GOES TO THE BACK COUNTRY HAVE SEEN DIEGO- BUT ALSO. ALSO ON EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO I'M KIND OF COORDINATE. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT'S ON THE SUBJECT THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MISTER DAVIS TINA- NOVEL OF.

I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING A HEARING AND GIVING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EDISON THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU. I'M ACTUALLY MADE OUT. THIS YEAR AND YEAR ON OUR LAW FIRM. PROGRAM THIS INCLUDES ACTING ON THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM LAST YEAR'S UP YES YES EVENTS. WE PROVIDE YOUR PRESENTATION I WILL OCCASIONALLY REFERRED TO IT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS BUT- BUT- REALLY I'LL BE REFERRING TO- THREATENED TO A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THAT SLIDE. I WILL COVER TODAY THE WORK WE'VE DONE OVER LAST YEAR AGAIN BEFORE AN OFFER A MITIGATION PLAN. I WIT ME HERE TODAY IS- JOE ANDERSON OUR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT CUSTOMER SERVICE I SHALL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE PARTICULAR AREAS OF OUR YES YES PROGRAMS. I'LL COVER SOME OF THOSE ALSO. INITIALLY HANDLING THE CUSTOMER CARE ELEMENTS WHICH WHICH EXCHANGING CONTINUE RECALL. AS WE- AS WE FULLY DEVELOPED YES YES PROGRAMS. NOT AT. SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY AND IT IS A VALUE WE LIVE DAILY- WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ALSO SO IT IS- IS CLEAR AND IMPORTANT. THAT WE USE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN AND CONTINUING PROGRAM. THAT'S WHY WELL I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY. I AM EQUALLY IF NOT MORE INTERESTED IN AND WE'RE MORE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR CONCERNS AND FEEDBACK YOU MIGHT HAVE OUR PROGRAMS. NOW THE PSP RESIDENTS TO TRANSPIRE LAST YEAR POSE A HARDSHIP FOR MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER WE ARE COMMITTED TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT. OF THOSE EVENTS GOING FORWARD AND MINIMIZE HE- IMPACT TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SPS. LAST YEAR WHEN I SPOKE TO THIS COMMITTEE- WE TALK ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE EVENTS WE HAVE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMERS OR METER ACROSS OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES. OF THOSE. ROUGHLY A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WERE IMPACTED WHICH EQUATES TO ROUGHLY 2% OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE. NOW WHEN WE COMPARE THAT TO A WILDFIRE RISK AREA- OVER A THIRD OF OUR TERRITORY USING HIGH FIRE RISK AREA SO WE GET SIGNIFICANT- NOW WE MADE A NUMBER PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT SINCE WE LAST SPOKE AND WE WILL BE SENDING A TIME- TO. IN TIME TO TALK ABOUT THOSE. AND THE COVER A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES FROM- SITUATIONAL AWARENESS- TO MORE AGGRESSIVE HARDENING OF CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR CIRCUITS. OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS SAID INCLUDE SOMETHING WE CALL SWITCHING PLAYBOOKS- THAT ENABLES US IN PSP EVENTS TO MEN FIVE MINIMIZING IMPACT AND SCOPE OF THOE EVENTS. AND WE TAKE YOU IN NASA DRAMATIC STEPS IN THE CUSTOMER CARE AREAS INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS ARE WEBSITE- INFORMATION FLOW INFORMATION SHARING ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES AND WITH OUR KEY STAKEHOLDERS. NOW AT IF WANT TO COMPARE AND STEP BACK TO WHAT IS OUT ON ME. IF WE LOOK SIMILAR PATTERNS AND WE HAD LAST YEAR- WE WOULD SEE REDUCTION 30% INTEREST IN THE SAME NUMBER SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC SAW. THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IMPACTED BY PSP S. VANCE. NOTHING FOCUS ON THOSE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WE WOULD EXPECT OUT OF AT LEAST TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THOSE TO NOT BE TEST ALL IPSP US OF AND- AGAIN IN SIMILAR WEATHER. WEATHER CONDITIONS SO PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AND WE'RE NOT STOPPING THERE WERE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO MAKE THE STUFF. UNLESS A PACKAGE OR CUSTOMERS. THAT WHILE THERE WERE LESSONS LEARNED AGAIN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY- THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OPERATIONS FROM. LAST YEAR'S EVENT SHOW THAT WE'RE. ON THE RIGHT TRACK WHEN IT COMES TO. INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING AND R. O. MANY. FOR SOME OF THE NUMBERS I CITED BEFORE THERE ALSO SOME OF THE INSPECTION RESULTS WE SAW AFTER PSP A SPENCER CARD. A RECENT MONTHS WE'VE ALSO ADDRESS THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT THE CODE NINETEEN IS GOING TO HAVE. OR COULD HAVE. ON BOTH OUR WORKFORCE AND OUR CUSTOMER BASE- MUCH- MUCH LIKE THE OTHER UTILITIES WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS SEQUESTER WORKFORCE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE SAFE AND ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS ARE WE DONE THINGS INCLUDING STAGGERED SHIFTS ISSUED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT CHANGED OUR WORK PRACTICES- AND WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AS WE KNEW OUT AGES DURING. THE THIRD HOLE A CRITERIA SO WE HAVE WORKED HARD TO KEEP TO YOUR CRITICAL WALLS ARE MITIGATION WORK. IN THE SAME TIME MINIMIZE THE IMPACT THESE OUT OF JUST HAVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES- AND THIS ALSO GOES INTO PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL BE DOING WHEN THE SPS OFFENSE HAPPENS. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE. ABOUT THINGS WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY. UNITIES AND HOW. OF PULLING INTO. A EVENTS ALONG WITH GOVERNOR. IN OUR THANK YOU. AND THAT'S THE CURRENT CAN DO REALLY BEING THE P. S. P. S. WILL BE PART OF OUR- WAY OF DEALING WITH EXTREME EVENTS. FOR THE FORESEEABLE UTURE- NOW WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON MINIMIZING IT WE BELIEVE IN CREDIT AND THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT- IMPROVEMENT STORE GREG- THINGS LIKE COVERKING DOCTOR SPECIALIZING DEVICES. ALL THOSE WE CRITICAL TORE MITIGATION EFFORTS AND PARTICULARLY THIS REDUCING THE IMPACT FUTURE YES. AND THE ONGOING WORK IS- REFLECTED OUR TWENTY TWENTY MALL FOR MEDICATION PLAN AND ALSO IN OUR EYES YOUR C. WHICH IS NOW PENDING BEFORE THE COMMISSION. NOW AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING THE WORK THIS LEGISLATURE AND OUR REGULATORS EXCEPT FOR US WE'RE ALSO FINDING WAYS TO DO MORE. S. IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE INSTALLED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILES COVER CONDUCT. WE'VE INSTALLED SEVEN HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS SO FAR WITH PLANS TO INSTALL MANY MORE. WE ALSO INSTALL HUNDRED SIXTY HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR. TO THE ONES THAT BRIAN JUST MENTIONED- THOSE TWO OR SHARE WITH OUR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY AID US IN RESPONDING TO FIRES WHEN THEY OCCUR. AND HELPING OUR FIRST RESPONDERS THAT INFORMATION DESPITE THOSE FIRES QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY. OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLANS GOING TO BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE YEARS PRIOR. THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY STEPPING UP DEPLOYMENTS THINGS LIKE COVER CONDUCTOR GOING TO MOVE SWIFTLY DELIBERATELY- TO REDUCE WILDFIRE IN. THE IMPACTS OF PS PS. ACOSTA MURS IN ADVANCE OF THIS YEAR'S FIRE SEASON. WE DID MENTION WE ALREADY HAD ONE OF AND WHAT WE DID STAND UP IN PREPARATION FOR A LOT HARDER THAN. WE DO NOT HAVE TO BE ENERGIZED. NUMBER TWENTY TWENTY PLAN WE PROPOSE THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. INVESTED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OUR EQUIPMENT ARE LIKE WHAT WOMEN. IS THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE. NOW IT ALSO- COLLATERAL IT WILL IMPACT AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE S. P. S. WE HAVE OVER THAT TIME FOR. SOMEONE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CORE AREAS IN OUR WATER MITIGATION PLAN. STANDS FINDS FIVE THREE SIXTEEN- THIS IS JUST A SAMPLING THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL ON THE SIDES ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO LOOK THREE DOES. EVER SINCE. SEC KNOWLEDGES AND MANY OTHER PROGRAMS FROM WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE CORE ONES HERE TODAY. THIS IS ALL BAY. AND PRESS. ON FOUNDER FOR THIS IS RISK MODELING. THAT WE USE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE THE TARGET AWHILE FARM RELATIONS EFFECTIVELY. AND TARGETS AND HELPS US- DECIDE WHAT THINGS TO DO FIRST. THESE TOOLS LEVERAGE MACHINE LEARNING. AND HIGH LEVEL DATA ANALYTICS- HELP US PREDICT THE PROBABILITY WITNESSES FOR EXAMPLE- WE ALSO LOOK AT THE WORLD HISTORICAL FIRE INFORMATION. AND WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE AS A WILDFIRE CONSEQUENCE YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE REACTS MODELING- THIS ENABLES MORE PRECISE. SWORD THIS IS OF ALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. AT ONE POINT. WE WERE TARGETING HIGH FIRE AREA MITIGATION SUCH AS COPPER CONDUCTOR. A CIRCUIT LEVEL. SERVICE MAY BE SEVERAL MILES. OF MILES. WE NOW TURN IT. ON SPAN. SPANS OF. THREE HUNDRED FEET. SO MUCH MORE PRECISION AND WHEN WE DEPLOY. THESE RISK MITIGATION. ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU RISK. RISK ANALYTICS. WE'RE DOING IS ARTS. USUALLY OUT LAST YEAR WE INSPECT 1% OR AND HIGH RISKY. NOW WE THOUGHT THERE WAS A BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A COPPER IS OUTSIDE OF THE ROUTINE INSPECTIONS THAT WE HAVE DONE HISTORICALLY AND THOSE THAT WE'VE AUGMENTED FOR FIRE PREVENTION. OVER THE HISTORY OF OUR OPERATIONS. THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TARGET THE HIGHEST RISK CIRCUITS THAT ARE IN THAT CATEGORY I'M GOING TO DO THAT BOTH ON THE GROUND AND IN THE AIR USING DRONES HELICOPTERS. NOW WHAT THIS MEANS IS FOR COMPLIANCE PURPOSES IN THE PAST DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT WOULD BE INSPECTED EVERY FIVE YEARS TRANSMISSIONS WOMEN WOULD BE INSPECTED EVERY THREE YEARS. THIS HIGH RISK OF WHAT WE EXPECTED EVERY YEAR AND NOW ON THE GROUND AND BY AIR THIS IS A TREMENDOUS STEP UP IN THE AMOUNT OF INSPECTIONS WERE DOING AT THE DATA WERE SO YOU HELP US TO. BETTER MEDICATIONS AND MORE EFFECTIVE THE SPS DEPLOYMENT. NOT A TECH FRONT AS HE DEPLOYING. TO DETECT FAULTS BEFORE THEY OCCUR. DISTRIBUTION FALLS. ANTICIPATION FOR EXAMPLE IS USING DATA ANALYTICS TO PROTECT FALLS. IN ADVANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE BASED ON SIGNATURES WERE SEEING ON THE LINES AND TAKE ACTION BEFORE THEY OCCUR. OTHER WORDS FOR SMOKERS. WHEN YOU DO THAT AGAIN YOU'RE REDUCING THE CHANCES FIRES AND EVEN IMPROVING THE OPERATIONS OR SYSTEM. DURING PSP S. OFFENSE. DOWNTURN OF INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING WE CONTINUE REFINE AND TARGET SECTIONAL ICING AS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAM. ESTARá CLEAN THIS IS BEEN A CORE ELEMENT OF OUR GREAT MONETIZATION ELEMENTS IT HAS BOTH RELIABILITY PS PS. BENEFITS TO US SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS BUT IT'S STILL A PROGRAM WE'RE TARGETING MORE MORE OF IT BASED ON LEARNING THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM PSP SSETS. THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CAR OR PROGRAM. BUT OUR PROGRAM THE MORBIDITY TO AS A CORE ELEMENT OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE HARDING IS COVER CONDUCTOR INSULATION NOW OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS INSTALL FIVE HUNDRED MILES OF THIS BUT WE'RE TARGETING SEVEN HUNDRED MILES FOR THIS YEAR WITH THE REST OF TARGETED FORTY FIVE HUNDRED MILES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS THAT AGAIN THIS ELIMINATES THE REST OF MOST- EMISSIONS FROM OUR LINES AND IT'S VERY COST EFFECTIVE I'M USING A RISK ANALYTICS TO TARGET THE HIGHEST RISK SEGMENTS OUR SYSTEM. IN OUR FOCUSED ON COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE COVER CONDUCTOR. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT UNDERGROUND AS A MEANS OF REDUCING RISK FROM WILDFIRES ARE LOOKING SELECTIVE CRITERIA THINGS SUCH AS EXCESSIVE P. SPS ADVANCE ONLINE OR LIMITED EGRESS. IN A CERTAIN AREAS WERE UNDER BROWN IS A BETTER SOLUTION AND WE'LL MOVE FORWARD. AND WE'RE DOING ANALYTICS AND MANY FOR SOME SEGMENTS HONOR CIRCUIT FOR DEPLOYMENT TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NOW FOR A MORE- IT'S A TRADITIONALLY- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS STILL KEY COURSE OF OUR PROGRAM AS WE LOOK AT SOURCES OF IGNITIONS PREDOMINANTLY FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON THERE WHEN OBJECTS COME INTO CONTACT WITH OUR LINES SOME OF THOSE ARE VEGETATION SO INCREASING OUR CLEARANCES AND REMOVING TREES WHO A NEW PROGRAM THAT WE DEVELOP THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH IS A HAZARD TREE MANAGER PROGRAM REDUCING THE THREAT OF IGNITIONS ALSO CREATING BASICALLY- FIRE BREAKS AROUND OUR POLLS COUPLE HOLD CLEARING BRUSH SO THAT'S A PROGRAM WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY RAMPED UP TO REDUCE THE CHANCES. OF OUR EQUIPMENT BECAUSE YOU. FINALLY WITH RESPECT SITUATE AWARENESS. AGAIN I MASON SIXTY WEATHER'S. HI DEVON CAMERA. ALSO THE SEVEN HUNDRED WHICH WHETHER SPACES WE JUST ALL INSTALLED BY THE WAY BY THE END OF THE YEAR WE EXPECT WILL HAVE THE DENSEST. WEATHER NETWORK. IN THE COUNTRY SO WHEN YOUR INFORMATION NETWORK IN THE COUNTRY WILL USE THAT DATA. AND YOU JUST WEATHER STATIONS WILL% INSTALLFOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS YEAR IN THE COMING YEARS. TO INFORM OUR ANALYTICS AND ARE MODELING OUR WEATHER MODELING HELP US MAKE GOOD DECISIONS BOTH ON WHERE WE DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURES. AN IMPORTANT FOR THIS PROCEEDING HOW WE DECIDE WHEN AND HOW AND HOW LARGE. PSP IS ENTITIES. NOW IMPORTANTLY ARE TWENTY TWO PLAN INCLUDES THE MEASURE TO TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC IN ORDER STAKEHOLDERS. AND THEY'LL UNABLE ARE REGULATED TO MONITOR OUR PROGRESS HER PERFORMANCE. WE JUST TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN AETOLIAN A REGULATOR IS CRITICAL. NOW WILL LEAD TO AN UNDERSTANDING CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OUR PROPOSED MEDICATIONS AND INVESTMENT CIRCLES REDUCING THE REST AND PROTECTING CUSTOMERS FROM UNNECESSARY COSTS THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE OUR OBJECTIVES SO YOU FOR LIBEL AND AFFORDABLE OUR WE NEED TO MITIGATE MALL HIGHER RISK. AT THE SAME TIME. AND WE'VE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF WILD FIRE MITIGATION FOR MANY YEARS NOW. NOW AFTER THE DEVASTATING DEVASTATING CARBON TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN RENDON TOOK A PROGRAM ARE REALLY SAFETY RESOURCES PLAN. AND THIS WAS IN THE ADVANCE OF THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE- WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT WE KNOW OF TODAY. BUT AT THAT TIME FOR THOSE WERE DEVELOPED WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES ON OUR LIVES. THIS IS WHAT LED TO THE INITIAL DEPLOYMENT OF COVER CONDUCTOR AND ALSO REFINED EVEN MORE SECTION LIES AND- INVESTMENTS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. NOW ABOVE AND BEYOND APPROACH TO THIS REFLECTS OUR SENSE OF URGENCY OUR SENSE OF MISSION. THIS REALLY IS JOB ONE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ITS- AND ITS REFLECTION OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EDISON MEN AND WOMEN WHO DEDICATED COUNTLESS HOURS AND EFFORTS. CONTINUE TO DO SO- AS WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND MODIFY OUR PRACTICES AND OUR PROCEDURES. TO MITIGATE AND REDUCES THE GOVERNMENT. AND WE WERE APPRECIATE IT. TO SPEAK YOU HERE TO. LOOKING FOR. FEEDBACK ON OUR PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WE ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU AND CALLING TO ME W. LOCAL FORTY SEVEN FOR. TO GET ALL THIS WORK DONE I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR FIRST RESPONDER COMMUNITY. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH- CLOSELY TO HELP US AND FORM WHAT WE DO. IN OUR QUEST TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES. NOW LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS ARE PROGRAM WHAT WE'RE DOING LIKE TURNS OVER NOW. JOE ANDERSON TO TALK IN MORE DETAIL ABOUT OUR PS FOUR VS PS PROGRAMS AND YOU PROMISE WE MADE IN THE CUSTOMER. SERVICE IN OUR. FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SPELL. MANY HEAR ME YES GREAT SOUND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JILL ANDERSON I AM THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON I JUST WANT TO START OUT SAYING THAT YOU WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THAT CUSTOMERS ARE COUNTING ON OUR POWER NOW MORE THAN EVER AS MANY PEOPLE BEFORE ME TODAY HAVE MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS SAID DISCONNECTIONS FOR NON PAYMENT OF AND TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED. WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING CRITICAL WORK ONLY WHERE IT'S NEEDED FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN HARDENING THE GREATEST STILL HAS TALKED ABOUT AND OF COURSE WHAT WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT ARE. STILL MENTION WE HAVE FIVE MILLION CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND LAST YEAR IN THE MOST YOU KNOW THE LARGEST PS PS EVENTS THAT WE HAD A LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED NOW IF YOUR ONE OF THOSE CUSTOMERS YOU NEXT 2% OF THE CUSTOMERS WE SERVE AND THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A LOT OF COMFORT BECAUSE ANY CUSTOMER THAT EXPERIENCING A POWER OUTAGE IT'S OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY IMPACTFUL FOR THEM AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MINIMIZE THE FREQUENCY AND THE IMPACT OF THESE EVENTS WE'RE ALSO ESTABLISHING EVEN STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES COUNTY AND STATE LEADERSHIP AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. OUR YES WE BEGIN LOOK AT. EVENT WE DO OUT REACH WITH PARTNER THREE DAYS IN A TALK ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL CONCERNS THEY MIGHT HAVE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE- NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM OUT IN ADVANCE. ALSO ALL OF THIS IN ADDITIONAL COORDINATION IN THE FORECAST DATA THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT THAT'S HELPING AS IT BE BETTER ABOUT SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS. IT'S A WE REACH OUT TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE AT RISK FOR A POSSIBLE DE ENERGY STATION FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN ADVANCE. AND I WANT TO TALK JUST FOR THE NEXT MINUTE ABOUT FOUR KEY AREAS WHERE WE LISTENED TO YOUR FEEDBACK WE LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCES AND WE'RE ADOPTING OUR APPROACH FOR TWENTY TWENTY. AND THOSE FOUR AREAS ARE ABOUT COMMUNICATION ABOUT BACKUP POWER THE CUSTOMER CARE ITSELF AND THEN COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. SO THE FIRST ONE AND I WOULD SAY IT'S DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST LEARNING FOR US. WAS LESS YEAR WAS THAT WE REALLY NEEDED TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO CUSTOMERS IN MORE CONVENIENT WAY. AND SO WE'VE RESPONDED TO THIS BY EXPANDING NOTIFICATION NOT JUST TO CUSTOMERS THAT OUR ACCOUNT HOLDERS BUT NOT ACCOUNT HOLDERS ARE YOU MIGHT HAVE THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE LIVING IN A HOUSE THAT ONLY ONE OF THEM IS. AN ACCOUNT HOLDER AND SO WE'VE DONE THINGS LIKE EXPANDED OUR USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LIKE NEXT DOOR WE'RE OFFERING MULTIPLE IN LANGUAGE OPTIONS IN MAKING IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO GET MORE FREQUENT UPDATES ON OUR WEBSITE WE'RE ALSO MAKING OUR SITE ITSELF MORE RELIABLE FOR INCREASED VOLUME THAT WE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR AND WE'RE EXPECTING IN THE FUTURE. AND EVEN SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THIS BILL MENTIONED LIKE THE CAMERAS WE MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC TO TRY TO SHARE IT BE AS- TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. THE SECOND AREA- WHERE WE RESPONDED TO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK IS AROUND BACK UP POWER SOLUTIONS IN PROVIDING. REALLY A VARIETY OF NEW REBATES TO HELP. YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER GROUPS GOING INTO TWENTY TWENTY IN THE SEASON. ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. WE HAVE NOW IS FULLY SUBSIDIZED BACKUP BATTERY POWER PROGRAM THAT'S FOR OUR INCOME QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS. THAT ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL CARE WHICH MEANS THEY'RE USING LIFE SUSTAINING OR LIFE SUPPORTING EQUIPMENT AT HOME. WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING OTHER SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO CUSTOMERS DURING PSP EVENTS YES. YES EENTS LIKE. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS IN THE COMMUNITY VEHICLES THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. THE THIRD AREA ONE TALK ABOUT IS ON THE CUSTOMER CARE PLANS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CIRCUIT LEVEL. AND SO HERE WE'RE LOOKING HOW WE CAN APPLY SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS TO MEET WHATEVER THE UNIQUE COMMUNITY NEEDS ARE AND LIKE SOME EXAMPLES YOU KNOW W COVER FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES SO IT'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY. IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. IN SOME OF THOSE AREAS CUSTOMERS ARE VERY DEPENDENT ON WELL WATER FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S IN OUR ACTED IN AGUA DULCE COMMUNITIES. OTHER WORLD COMMUNITIES HAVE OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SO WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING PROGRAMS LIKE A NEW REPEAT PROGRAM FOR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE A GENERATOR THAT IS FOR WELL WATER. POWER BACK. AND THEN THE LAST AREA TO COVER IS HOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SUCH AS THOSE WITH ACCESS TO. NEEDS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND OTHER LOCAL COUNTY SERVICES- YOU KNOW AS A RESULT OF WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF OUR REACH A LIVE STREAMS IN VIRTUAL COMMUNITY MEETINGS. AND WE FOUND THAT CLOSE 280% OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT ENGAGED IN THOSE MEETINGS WITH US IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. HAVE SAID THAT THEY BETTER INFORMED ABOUT WHAT I SEE IS DOING TO REDUCE THE RISK WHILE CRIER. AND SO BASED ON THIS THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED AND- CONTINUE TO LEARN AND ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU AND- SEE IF YOU SEEN OUR CUSTOMERS. IN WE'RE CONFRONTING I BELIEVE WE'RE CONFRONTING THIS FIRE SEASON WITH NEW TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND- AND REALLY IMPORTANTLY YOU'RE JUST BETTER. FOR HOW WE CAN MANAGE THE DISTRACTIONS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS. YOU KNOW OUR CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE WHEN WE KNOW THAT HE CONCERN FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REQUIRES US TO DE ENERGIZED. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND- YOU KNOW JUST TO REITERATE AS BILLS THAT WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE AND- IT IS. ASSN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE AND- AND WE CONTINUE TO BE COMMITTED TO LISTENING AND LEARNING AND IMPROVING SO. I'LL ADD TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU TO SEE WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS WE MIGHT BE ABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH KNOWS VERY. AFFORDABLE INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION. WE HAVE A QUESTION BY SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE. OUR TESTIMONY OUR WITNESSES- MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WAS ABOUT. AND THE BACKUP GENERATOR PROGRAM AND I KNOW THAT THE TARGET NUMBER THAT I SAW IN THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WAS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CUSTOMERS I RECOGNIZE THAT ONLY 2% OR SO OF AS SEIZE TERRITORY WAS REALLY HIT BY THIS P. S. P. S. BUT- WHOSE ABOUT HALF MY DISTRICT SO IT FEELS A LOT BIGGER THAN TWO PERCENT- SPECIALLY WHEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER IS CALLING YOU ASKING- TO GET- RESCUED AND PICKED UP WHEN SHE CAN'T GET HER MEDICINE REFRIGERATED SO. THIS IS PERSONAL BUT I APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS YOU'VE MADE I'M JUST WONDERING WITHIN THAT. THAT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED CUSTOMER UNIVERSE THAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET. THOSE CRITICAL BACKUP RESOURCES TO- MAN SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TRY TO RIG UP A DIESEL GENERATOR IN THEIR HOUSE OR SOME OTHER. D. I. Y. WAY OF GETTING KEEPING THEIR POWER ON HOW MANY PEOPLE. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL BASS LINE OR CRITICAL CARE BUT MAYBE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE HAVE BEEN SIGNED UP. HOW MANY OF THOSE FOLKS- WON'T BE INCLUDED IN THIS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. CUSTOMER TARGET UNIVERSE IN OTHER WORDS ARE YOU GOING BEYOND JUST THOSE WHO HAVE SIGNED UP FOR THE PROGRAMS OR IS THIS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN THOSE EXTRA STEPS TO SIGNING UP FOR THINGS LIKE MEDICAL BASELINE. SORRY SO I CAN ADDRESS THAT SO. WE ARE TARGETING THE POPULATION THAT WE HAVE AWARENESS OF THAT ARE IN NEED AND SO WE'VE GOT TO I GOT THE NUMBERS HERE WE'VE GOT NINETY THREE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS ACROSS OUR SERVICE AREA THAT OUR MEDICAL BASELINE- AND OF THAT WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE THAT ARE IN HIGH. RISK AREAS. WHEN WE SUBSET OF THOSE CUSTOMERS THE ONES THAT ARE USING EQUIPMENT FOR LIFE STATING OR SUPPORTING NEEDS. IN OUR HAD HIGHER RISK AREA IT'S JUST ABOUT JUST UNDER FIVE THOUSAND AND THEN THE PROGRAM THAT WE'VE DESIGNED AS YOU POINT OUT TARGETS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. THAT'S THAT INTERSECTION OF CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE IDENTIFIED AS MEDICAL BASS LINE WITH THAT CRITICAL COMPONENT AND ALSO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED INCOME QUALIFY SO THERE OF INCOME LEVELS THAT MAKE THEM YOU KNOW IT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MOST GENEROUS AND SUPPORTIVE CREATES INCENTIVES. BUT YOUR QUESTION ARE WE ARE WE ONLY ACHIEVING YOUR REACHING THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE KNOW OF AND YES WE ARE AND THAT'S WHY ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING IN OUR REGION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. AT YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE AWARE OF THESE PROGRAMS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO ENROLL CUSTOMERS YOU JUST ON THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE INCOME QUALIFIED PROGRAMS OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS WE'VE MORE THAN DOUBLED OUR NORMAL ENROLLMENT RATE CUSTOMERS INTO IN QUALIFYING. ROUNDS AND AS WE REACH OUT TO CUSTOMERS ABOUT OUTAGES OR THESE OTHER INCENTIVES WE ARE ASKING PROACTIVELY DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MEDICAL BASS LINE DO YOU MEET THIS CRITERIA SO THAT WE CAN ENROLL CUSTOMERS. AND THE LAST POINT IS THAT WE'VE ALSO ONLY HERE IT NEEDS TO BE REQUIRED DOT KNOWS TO JUSTIFY THE ENROLLMENT IT IN ALL OF THE CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW WE STAY AT HOME IN PEOPLE. UNDERSTANDABLY NOT WANTING TO GO BURKE ROUTINE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS WE WAIVE THAT CRITERIA TEMPORARILY WHICH IS ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE. TO INCREASE. AT THANKS THAT. WE OWE YOU ASSIST IN THAT AT REACH. TO WE WANT MAKE SURE FIND OUT HE'S YOUR TOUGH REACH PEOPLE OF FOLKS WHO MAYBE AREN'T ON THE INTERNET THERE. BEEN ANY CAN BE DRIVING BY A BILLBOARD SO I WOULD HOPE THAT. YOU YOU CAN INTERFACE WITH COUNTY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR AYE HSS CUSTOMER BASE. WITHIN LA COUNTY ALONE I THINK WORD OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE ON AYE HSS SO NINETY THREE THOUSAND VERSES. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO BUT- STAND READY TO HELP IN THAT EFFORT. THE LAST QUESTION WAS JUST DO YOU HAVE A- I'M SORRY IF I MISSED THIS IN THE PRESENTATION BUT IS THERE. A SORT OF TARGET.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO LEARNING FROM THIS DEFENSE AND OUR FOCUS ON KEEPING OUR CUSTOMERS COMMUNITIES AND WORKFORCE SAY. TODAY WE WILL PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMMEDIATE AND COMPREHENSIVE ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING TO UPGRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MONITOR FIRE THREATS IN REAL TIME. AN INSTITUTE NEAR WILD FIRE SAFETY MEASURES. AROUND FIRE MITIGATION PLAN OUTLINES THREE MAIN OBJECTIVES. REDUCING WILD FIRE IGNITION POTENTIAL REDUCING WILDFIRE SPREAD THROUGH IMPROVED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT. I'LL DISCUSS THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE SO FAR IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ALSO KEY TO NEWS RESPONSE TO KOBE. AND THAT RELATIONSHIP TO OUR WILD FIRE AFTER. IF YOU HAVE THE MATERIALS AND FROM ALONG MUCH LINE. I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THAT WE ARE TAKE AS PART OF OUR- WHILE FOR SAFETY. TO HELP BURKE. UNITIES SAFE. OURMAYBE PLANNED WAS TO THE CPC EARLIER THIS YEAR. I'LL START THE STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES FROM ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT. BY MITIGATING THE NUMBER CAUSES OF THE IGNITION. OUR ENHANCED BUT MANAGE IS MEETING AND EXCEEDING STATE MEDITATION AND FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TREES AND LIMBS THAT COULD FALL. WORKING AND SHORELINES WERE IMPROVING OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT BY CONTINUING TO NAVAL DEVICES CLOSERS THAT ALLOW OPERATORS TO REMOTELY PREVENT ONLINE FOR ME. AFTER A FAULT. REMINDED AREN'T SEXY PROGRAM USING LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR TOTAL SYSTEM EXPECTED INSPECTION THAT TOOK PLACE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. IT FURTHER UPGRADING AND STRENGTHENING OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM IN THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK BY INSTALLING MORE pTHE STRONGER AND MORE RESILIENT HOLES AND COVERED POWER LINES ALONG WITH TARGETED UNDERGROUND. WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE PS YES DURING THE YEAR FIRE RISKY GESTIONES REDUCE. EMISSIONS MOVING ON TO SITUATIONAL. NEXT WE'RE CONTINUING TO INSTALL REAL TIME MONITORING AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW SEVERE WEATHER IN OUR SYSTEM I'M PRO ACTIVELY RESPOND TO POTENTIAL THREATS. THE FURTHER OUR WEATHER FORECASTING CAPABILITIES THE GENIE IS BUILDING OUR OWN NETWORK OF WEATHER STATIONS TO MONITOR AND FORECAST WEATHER CONDITIONS. ALONG WITH IMPROVED WEATHER FORECASTING MODELS THESE IMPROVE OUR ABILITY PROJECT FOR EXTREME WILD FIRE WEATHER COULD OCCUR SO WE CAN RESPOND QUICKLY AND APPROPRIATELY TO KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS SAY. WE'RE ADDING APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED NEW WEATHER STATIONS THIS YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE SIX HUNDRED AND SAW THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WE WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED NEW WEATHER STATIONS TWENTY TWENTY. THAT'S ABOUT ONE STATION EVERY TWENTY SECOND MILES IN OUR HIGH HIGHER RISK AREAS. WHEN INSTALLING TWO HUNDRED NEW HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS IN HIGH PRIORITY AREAS FOR A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE. TWENTY WITH THE TARGET OF SIX HUNDRED BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ULTIMATELY LED US VISUALLY MONITOR OVER 90% OF THE HIGHER HI FIRED RISK AREAS OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. OUR WHILE TIRE SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN MONITORS POTENTIAL WILDFIRE ACROSS OUR SERVICE AREA IN REAL TIME IN COORDINATION PREVENTION AND RESPONSE EFFORTS. THE CENTER LEVERAGES A SATELLITE FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM THAT TAKES FIRE STATUS DATA FROM SIX DIFFERENT SETTLEMENT. MOVING ON TO SLIDE FIVE WHICH IS ABOUT REDUCING THE IMPACTS OF YES YES THE BANDS. I'D LIKE TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUTTLE PROGRAM. WE LEARNED A LOT FROM THE P. S. TS SEASONS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE ARE CHANGING THE PS YES PROGRAM THIS YEAR MAKING MEN'S SMALLER SHORTER AND SMARTER TO KEEP CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITY SAFE DURING TIMES OF SEVERE WEATHER AND HIGH WILD VIRUS. THIS TOOK FULL. THE RISK CAST WHILE DURING YOUR FIRE WHETHER WE NOW TURNING OFF POWER TO PROTECT AGAINST DEVASTATING WILDFIRES WITHOUT ACTION ALSO JUST WRITE LINES PRESENTS ON PUBLIC SAFETY RISK. OUR FIRST GOAL IS THAT ANY NEW PS YES EVEN WILL AFFECT ONE THIRD FEWER CUSTOMERS THAN A COMPARABLE WOULD HAVE LAST YEAR. WE WILL REDUCE CUSTOMER IMPACTS THROUGH IMPROVED METEOROLOGICAL DATA FOR CASTING SAFELY MINIMIZING TRANSMISSION IMPACTS AND BY PLACING DISTRIBUTED GENERATION SUBSTATIONS AND OTHER LOCATIONS THE SUPPORT ISOLATED POCKETS OF CUSTOMERS WHO ARE STATE TO OPERATE INSIDE. WIDER DE ENERGIZED. WE ARE INSTALLING OVER SIX HUNDRED ACTUALIZING DEVICES TO ALLOW US TO MANAGE TO CREATE AND SMALLER MORE FLEXIBLE SECTIONS. AS NOTED BY MS PETERSON WE ADJUSTED OUR APPROACH TO THESE DEVICES EARLIER THIS YEAR WHICH DELAYED INSULATE HOWEVER WHAT MAKING. REST ON THAT. TODAY AND MONITORING IT ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THIS WILL LET US MANAGE YES YES HE BOUNCE MORE SURGICALLY TO FAX YOUR CUSTOMERS WE ARE ALSO PLANNING TO USE NEW SEXUAL LASSEN SPECIALIZATION DEVICES I AM IN THE HUMBOLDT BAY GENERATING STATIONS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND YOU'RE MY CUSTOMERS JOSH IT'S NEARBY YES YES. YOU CAN JUST WRITE INCOMING TRANSMISSION LINES. SEC WE'RE SEEKING TO CUT RESTORATION TIMES IN HALF. RESTORED POWER WITHIN TWELVE DAYLIGHT HOURS AFTER THE SEVERE WEATHER HAS PASSED WE ARE NEARLY DOUBLING ARE CONTRACTED HELICOPTER SLEEP DURING THE ADVANCED FROM THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR SIXTY FIVE THIS YEAR SO THAT WE CAN MORE QUICKLY INSPECT FOR DAMAGING HASTERT'S AFTER SEVERE WEATHER AND RESTORE POWER TO KEEP YOU. AS SOON AS THEY FLEE. WE WILL USE TO FIXED WING AIRCRAFT WITH INFRARED CAMERAS. TRANSMISSION LINES AT NIGHT SO WE CAN SPOT ANY WEATHER CAUSED DAMAGES OR RE ENERGIZED AND DAMAGED THE FINE SINNERS.

IN TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT I WAS. HAD QUESTIONED THE PRESENT ABOUT YOUR OWN. SO MISS POWER IF YOU CAN JUST DISCUSS THE 33% TARGET. AND HOW LIKELY YOU ARE TO HIT THAT TARGET WITH ALL OF YOUR MAKER GREASE ALL YOUR SECTION IDEATION I HEARD THE UPDATE I HAVE THE NUMBERS RIGHT HERE BUT- HOW LIKELY ARE YOU TO HIT THAT OVERALL GOAL FOR THIS YEAR. THANK YOU AND- WITH A SIMILAR WET WEATHER EVENTS FROM LAST YEAR JUST THE BACKDROP ON THIS WE MODELED. ARE WORSE EVEN FROM LAST YEAR OUR WORST WHETHER YOU. LIKE I SEE AN SCG ANY WE BROUGHT ALL OF THE EXPERTS TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THINGS EVEN. RESULT DIFFERENTLY- GIVEN THE SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS IN SUBSEQUENT. AND THE SEXUAL IS DEVICES THE TEMPORARY GENERATION- THAT'S ACTUALLY XIN DEVICES AND THE- SWITCHING DEVICES ON THE TRANSMISSION. ARE THE COMPONENTS THERE DEREK WANTING TO HELP US TO DISSECT THE GRADED AND IN. CASE YOU ASKED MURSI'S POSSIBLE WE ARE TRACKING THOSE EFFORTS ON A WEEKLY BASIS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND- IN STRENGTH WERE GETTING MORE RESTORE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FULLY EXECUTE ON PLAN AND I AM- CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE. BACK TO OUR CUSTOMERS AGAIN COMPARED TO INVENT SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR BY ONE THIRD. OKAY IT'S GREAT SO IF WE CAN DO YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF A DEEP DIVE INTO THAT SO- THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION- WHEN IT WAS WHEN I WAS ASKED OF BY PRESENT A BACHELOR AND HER STAFF THE WORD IF MISS PETERSON KEPT SAYING IF THEY DO X. Y. Z. SO. WHERE IF YOU'RE IN A TEN POINT YOUR AREA OF BIGGEST CONCERN AS WE MOVE INTO POWER SHUT OFF SEASON IS IT THE ISSUE OF CONNECTING ALL OF THOSE GENERATORS IS IT COMPLETING THIS ACTUALIZATION SO IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE MAKING MORE PROGRESS ON THAT. IN IN OTHER AREAS CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THOSE CONCERNS AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WE GET CLOSER POWER SHUT OFF WHERE THERE IT CAN TURN ABOUT. MEETING THAT GOAL. I'M YOU. EONS WE'RE TRACKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT OCCUR TO BE REALLY HONEST SEXUALIZED IN DEVICES ARE THE AREA THAT WE ARE FOR THIS BEHIND BEHIND WHERE WE INTENDED BUT WE HAVE A TO GET US THERE ARE TRACKING IT VERY CLOSELY- THE TEMPORARY GENERATION WE USE TEMPORARY GENERATION AND TO REDUCE IMPACTS OUR CUSTOMERS AS PART OF THE PROJECT WORK PERFORMED AND THAT'S AN AREA THAT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN- NEAR THE C. P. COM. OF IF WE CAN ACCESS ON THE PLAN AND I THINK ABOUT THE IF THERE AND WE'RE WORKING TO PLAN ON IT WE'RE GOING TO BE CONDUCTING THREE EXERCISES THE SUMMER TO MAKE SURE ALL OF OUR TEAMS. NO AND ARE ABLE TO. FULFILL THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE IN IN MANAGING THE EIGHT THAT. WE'RE EXERCISING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN THOSE THREE DIFFERENT EVENTS AND THE PREPARATION AND THE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THAT- WE HAVE THE STEPS IN PLACE AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK THROUGH IT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS SPRING- YOU KNOW. WE HAD. THE NINETEEN LIMITATIONS AND WE'VE WORKED THROUGH THAT WE'D EVEN PRACTICE OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS- RESPONSIBILITIES. THAT WE'RE GOING TO WAS CALVIN. REMOTELY WE DONE NOT REMOTELY WE SET UP- TEMPORARY SITE SINCE THE QUESTOR CRUISE SO THEY WERE ABLE TO OPERATE RED. EVEN IF WE HAVE- SICKNESS ISSUES. IN SOME OF OUR CURRENT OPERATING CENTERS- WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO BE PREPARED AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE THERE. LIKE TO BE ABLE TO IF THROUGH THE CHAIR IF IT'S ALL RIGHT I'D LIKE TO BE A TO TALK ABOUT- TECHNO SILVA- AND I'LL PARAPHRASE HERE IN PLEASE FISH FACT ME IF YOU THINK MY PARAPHRASING IS INCORRECT BUT- BRINGING ON A NEW CONSULTANT. WHO WORKS WITH OTHER UTILITIES AND ALSO WORKS WITH CAL FIRE TO BE ABLE TO PREDICT- FIRE BEHAVIOR. AND WHAT A POTENTIAL SPARK NAY BE BASED OFF OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS THE TERRAIN- AND- WHERE YOU WOULD SEE THAT POTENTIAL FIRE IF IT WAS CAUSED BY UTILITY. HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO PLAY INTO YOUR PREDICTING WHEN IT COMES THE IN THIS MODELING INTO SHUTTING OFF COMMUNITIES THIS NEW MODELING. THE COMPANY NOW THAT YOU'RE IN CONTRACT WITH WHAT HOUSE IS GOING TO CHANGE THE GAME COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. THANK YOU. I THINK IT'S RATHER TECHNO SILVA IN OUR FOR CASTING CAPABILITIES FOR EVENTS LAST YEAR WE HAD IF YOU THINK ABOUT A COMPUTER SCREEN AND YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE PIXELS IN THIS COMPUTER SCREEN THINK ABOUT THAT ACROSS OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. LAST YEAR OUR CORE CASTING CAPABILITY WAS IN THREE BY THREE CLIMATE- PIXELS SO ABOUT NINE SQUARE KILOMETERS- THE ADVANCEMENT THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN IN OUR MODELING CAPABILITIES WHICH INCLUDES TECHNO SILVA- AMERI CORPS CREATING AND OUR SYSTEMS WERE ALREADY STARTING TO SEE THE STOCK. TWO BY TWO. SO OUR ABILITY TO I'M MORE ACTUALLY FOR THE WEATHER IN AS THEY PERTAIN TO OUR OUR RED IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER LAST YEAR. SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO HELP TO FIND THAT OUT SO FOR ISOLATE PEOPLE WHAT IS THAT MEAN AND WHAT CAN WE EXPECT IN REGARDS TO THE FORECASTING. WHAT THAT MEANS IS ARE FORECASTING IS ABOUT 0% MORE PRECISE THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR. AND IS OUR ABILITY TO- FOR CAPS THOSE WEATHER CONDITIONS WITH IN- THE GEOGRAPHY OF OUR TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS AND OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE ACCURATE. AND WHAT THAT ALLOW US TO DO IS START THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF THE ANY BANDS. SMALLER THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HELP US MAKE THE EVENTS SMALLER AND THAT'S THAT STARTS FROM DAY ONE WITH THE FORECAST. I'D LIKE TO JUMP TO THE ISSUE OF THE NORTH COAST AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SAW. LAST YEAR I UNDERSTANDING- ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN REGARDS TO DAYLIGHT HOURS IN GETTING- COMMUNITIES BACK UP AND RUNNING IN A QUICKER TIME PERIOD. SO THERE WERE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT WERE OFF BETWEEN TEN AND FOURTEEN DAYS BECAUSE ONE POWER SHUT OFF. BLOOD INTO ANOTHER. CAN YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT TO YOUR SERVICE TERRITORY TODAY THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO AVOID THOSE DOUBLE WHAMMY POWER SHUT OFFS WHERE ONE BELIEVES IN TO ANOTHER AND I AND I I'M SPEAKING SELFISHLY BECAUSE- LAKE MENDOCINO CINEMA IN A SMALL PART OF MARINE ALSOP ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN AND FOURTEEN DAY POWER SHUT OFF CAN YOU MAKE SOME ASSURANCES THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN THIS YEAR. SEC THAT'S TOUGH. BECAUSE THAT WAS DRIVEN BY THE WEATHER EVENTS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS- ONCE WE HAVE THE ALL CLEAR. FROM THE WEATHER EVENT WE HAVE THE HELICOPTER SO THEY MENTION WE HAVE THE SIX STRING WING AIRCRAFT THAT I MENTIONED. WHO CAN THEN CONTROL THE LINES I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE WE CAN RETURN CUSTOMERS THE SERVICE. WHAT I WOULD ALSO MENTION IS THAT- VERY IMPACTFUL SO THE NORTHERN COAST LAST YEAR- AND SOMETHING THAT WE CHANGE THIS YEAR AS WE HAVE- ENABLED THE HUMBOLDT BAY GENERATING. STATION ISLAND. I IN CAPE OF EVEN THOUGH THERE MAYBE TRANSMISSION IN PACKS UP AWAY FROM THE COAST LINE THAT AFFECTS THAT AREA. THE HOME WILL BE GENERATING STATION WILL BE ABLE THE ISLAND AND- MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR. SO THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY SEE. THE WIND POWER SHUT OFF BLEEDING TO ANOTHER THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY- WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS YOU NEVER WANT THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THERE'S STILL POTENTIAL FOR THAT. I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN WE HAVE PLANS FOR THAT NOT HAPPEN BUT WE CANNOT CONTROL THE SPEED AT WHICH THE WEATHER FRIENDS COME THROUGH. SO I PROMISE JUST HERE JUST TWO MORE QUESTIONS SO A FOLLOW UP ON THAT SO CAN YOU GO A LITTLE DEEPER ON IF WE- ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT AN EXTENDED POWER SHUT OFF. THE EXPENSE TO BUSINESS THE CHALLENGES TO SCHOOLS- I CAN KEEP GOING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT COMPENSATION FOR CUSTOMERS ON THAT. CAN I ASK FOR CLARIFICATION WHAT YOU'RE ASKING THE MY QUESTION IS IF WE'RE LOOKING AT OF A POTENTIAL TEN TO FOURTEEN DAY. SHUT OFF WHICH- I'LL BE HONEST WE CAN'T HAVE ANOTHER TWO WEEK SHUT OFF IN THE STATE AIDES WERE IN TWENTY TWENTY IT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE. SHOULD CUSTOMERS WHAT CUSTOMERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE A RECOUP THEIR BUSINESS LOST THEIR FOOD LOS EXEDRA. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD HERE INTO POWER SHUT OFF SEASON. I'M YEAH WE RECOGNIZE THE HARD JUSTICE CAUSED BY BEING WITHOUT POWER WE ALSO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THAT PSCS IS DRIVEN BY SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR TRAFFIC WILD FIRES. BEGIN WE UNDERSTAND THE HARDSHIP DISCUSSES AND AS SUCH WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO LIMIT ITS IMPACT. TO OUR POPULATIONS. OKAY FOR YOU KNOW GETTING ANSWER THAT ONE THAT'S THAT'S FINE SO I THINK THAT LOOK I HEAR YOU IN REGARDS TO POWER SHUT OFF IS BASED OFF OF SAFETY. AND BY THE WAY HIS PAL BUT PLEASE DON'T DIRECT MY DON'T DON'T TAKE MY COMMENTS BEING DIRECTED TO YOU MISS POWERS BEEN MORE THAN GRACIOUS IN HER TIME- SITTING DOWN ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND TRULY GRATEFUL AND WHOEVER IS IN NET SEAT HAS AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING JOB. IT'S BEEN A CULTURE AT THE UTILITY THIS IS NOT A MISS PALS FAULT. UNDERSTANDING SHE IS A VERY DIFFICULT JOB NOW THAT WHERE SHE IS NOW IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE AN ANSWER BUT I WANT TO GO A STEP FURTHER ON THAT ISSUE OF. YES THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BUT LET'S BE CANDID THIS CORPORATION IS BEHIND IN HAS BEEN BEHIND IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND SPECIALIZATION IN DEVELOPING TEMPORARY MICHAEL GRADES. THIS WAS USES A BLUNT INSTRUMENT LAST YEAR BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER TO WHEN YOU'RE TO ABOUT BECAUSE THE CORPORATION HAD FALLEN BEHIND YEARS YEARS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN KEEPING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE MODERNIZE IN SAFE SO. WE CAN CONTINUE TO SAY THIS IS A SAFETY- INSTRUMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH BUT NORTH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS REPEATING THESE CUSTOMERS ARE. FEELING NEGATIVE IMPACTS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INVESTMENT BY THE CORPORATION- OVERTIME SO I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT CLEAR MY LAST SIDE. IS ON- COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND I KNOW THEIR HELP IN A LOT OF TIME ISSUE. YOU CAN YOU GO THROUGH MORE TIME ON ISSUE I HOW YOUR- RAIN FOR THE SOCIAL DISTANCE SCENE AND WHAT TYPE OF CONTINGENCY PLANS WERE YOU HAVE IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO MEET COUNTY DEMANDS. IF WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCE CENTERS PROPPED UP BASED OFF OF THE CORONAVIRUS. SURE SO THE FIRST THING WE WOULD ALL LIKE THE HARDENED YOU KNOW SEE OUR SEASIDE SO EVERYBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE AND- YOU KNOW THERE. THEY'VE GOT THE GENERATION ASSOCIATED WITH THEY'VE GOT COOLING AT CENTER AND THAT WOULD BE IDEAL- AS WE WORK YOU KNOW THROUGH THE CALVET SITUATION RECOGNIZING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE SOME TENNIS. KEEPING THEM OPEN AIR AS A PROGRAM- HAVING MOBILE UNITS THAT WE CAN MOVE AROUND AND SERVE CUSTOMERS AND THE CURRENT- SAFE WAY IS WITH ALL OF THE REQUIRED PROTECTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE. BEING SPECIFIED BY THE VARIOUS COUNTIES- AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. IF THERE'S MORE INFORMATION THAT YOU WANT HERE I CAN I CAN HAVE OUR SACRAMENTO OFFICE FOLLOW UP WITH YOU DIRECTLY WITH MORE DETAILS. THAT'S GREAT I GUESS THE I'D LOVE TO BE A FOLLOW UP ABOUT THE FLEXIBILITY RIGHT SO WE ARE THE CURRENT VIRUS CHANGES IT SOMETIMES A WEEK BY WEEK. AND HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DEAL AND ADAPT IF AND WHEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN. AT EIGHT TIMES A DAY A FEW DAYS NOTICE I THINK THAT'S CAN BE CRITICAL OBVIOUSLY THE STATE IS FACING THAT THROUGH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- AND I KNOW THAT SOMETHING THE P. GENIES GONNA HAVE MY LAST QUESTION AND I'LL PUT THIS BACK TO THE CHAIR- MISSPELLED YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO TAKE TEN YEARS. TO COMPLETELY MODERNIZE YOUR SYSTEM- THIS DEVELOP ALL THE SECTIONAL IS ATION- ADVANCING MODERNIZATION MEASURES THAT YOU NEED TO WITHIN YOUR GRADE AND THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT DO YOU BELIEVE IT'S STILL GONNA TAKE A DECADE. I THINK IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A DECADE. OUR COMMITMENT THIS YEAR IS TO MAKE ANY PS PST VANS THAT WE HAVE TO CALL THIS. YEAR SHORTER IN DURATION OUR AND SMARTER AND HOW WE CALL THOSE AND WITH- WITH THE PLANS THAT WE'VE PUT INTO PLACE I WORK FOR EVERY YEAR MISLI IMPROVING AND SO WHEN WE SAY TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHAT'S IT GONNA LOOK LIKE. I HOPE IT'S MORE LIKE WHAT SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC BUT AS YOU KNOW VERY SHORT VERY PRECISE ROLE IN OUR CUSTOMERS ARE RESTORED AND ONE LIVING ON AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE STATEMENTS IS VERY MINIMAL IMPACT FROM THESE EVENTS NOT CIRCLE FOR YOUR FORMER CEO SAID IT'S GONNA TAKE A DECADE TO BE A TO GET TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO WHEN IT COMES THE MODERNIZATION WHEN IT COMES A SPECIALIZATION. WHEN IT COMES TO THAT TATIAN MANAGEMENT DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S GONNA TAKE A DECADE. I THINK WE'RE GONNA TO BE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING OUR SYSTEM OVER THAT DECADE- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACTS FELT BY OUR CUSTOMERS WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE. OKAY SO ON A TRY ONE MORE TIME SO. YOUR PREVIOUS CEO LAST YEAR WAS IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND HE SAID THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A DECADE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO WHERE THE CORPORATION NEEDS AGO WHEN IT COMES OF MODERNIZATION. FICTIONALIZED ASIAN INVITATION MANAGEMENT. DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A DECADE TO GET THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT BILLS INTENSE WAS WHEN HE SAID A DECADE. AGO I THINK WE WILL BE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN OUR SYSTEM. FOR MANY YEARS. AND THAT'S RALLY THEN THE WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT AT ALL AT ANY DISRESPECT IN THIS TOWN THIS CALL HAS BEEN WONDERFUL TO BE TO WORK WITH MISTER PATTERSON IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH. BUT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT- WHOEVER'S LEFT IN THE BOARD AT PACIFIC GAS ND ELECTRIC GO BACK AND CHECK THE RECORD GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT PRESS CLIPPINGS AND SEE WHAT THE FORMER CEO SAID CAN YOU TAKE A DECADE TO BE A TO GET THERE CALIFORNIANS DESERVE BETTER. IT NEEDS TO BE THAT DRAMATICALLY REDUCED AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPEDITE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE MODERNIZATION THIS ACTUALIZATION WITH POWELL THANK YOU SO MUCHFOR YOUR TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK THE QUESTIONS VERY GRATEFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY WILL THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF THE PROGRAM AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS.

REDUCE THEM DOWN IN SIZE BECAUSE YOU PUT IN THERE THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF SWITCHES TO BE ABLE TO SHUT DOWN YOUR GRID IN SMALLER- AREAS THEN IT WAS IT IN THE PAST WHERE WE OUT WITH WHAT WHAT'S THAT WOULD TAKE A LOOK LIKE THIS SEASON. SURE THANK YOU SO FIRST ON. THE DROUGHT AND THE DRYNESS.

AND FROM A HIGH FIRE DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE ABOUT 50% OF THE P. JEANNIE SERVICE TERRITORY IS CONSIDERED- HI FIRE THREAT. I'M MOVING ON TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EVENTS FROM LAST YEAR AND THE DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS- AND THE SEGMENTATION WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WE'VE INSTALLED MORE THAN. EVER OVER TWO HUNDRED SEGMENTATION DEVICES AND OUR PLANS ARE TO JUST INSTALL MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO DEVICES BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF HARD CIDER SEASON. AMBER SO SEPTEMBER IS OUR IS THE- GOAL OR THE TARGET THAT WERE TRACKING TO. AND THE INSTALLATION OF THE BY. IS WHAT MUCH MORE ISOLATED BULL TO IMPACT YOUR CUSTOMERS THAN WE-DID LAST YEAR THAT COMBINED WITH OUR TEMPORARY GENERATION. WILL ALLOW- COMMUNITIES WHO ARE NOT SEEING THE WEATHER CONDITIONS- I THE HIGH THE HIGH WIND CONDITIONS- IT WILL ALLOW SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES TO STAY WITH AND POWER AND THE COMMUNITY AREAS WHILE ISOLATING THE FOLKS WHO LIVE OUT MORE IN THE FURTHER OUT IN THE HIGH FIRE IT'S RIGHT. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION YES THANK YOU I KNOW THAT. AS THE GENIE IS THE POSTER CHILD FOR YOU KNOW HARDING THEIR GRID AND I KNOW THAT YOU TO THE PGA FOLKS ARE. BEHIND AND I KNOW AND I REALIZED IT AS THE GENIE STILL DOES PSP'S. THE GOAL FOR I HOPE FOR YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATION IS TO- NEAR THOSE DOWN- AND GET THERE QUICKER THAN THAN A DECADE AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS TRYING TO PUSH ON BECAUSE- OUR COMMUNITY JUST CANNOT WITHSTAND THAT THOSE MANY DAYS WITHOUT.
