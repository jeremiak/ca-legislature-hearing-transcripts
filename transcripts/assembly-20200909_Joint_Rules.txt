EQUIPPED TO BEAT THAT FUTURE AND AS WE MEET TODAY IN THIS ASSEMBLY CHAMBERS AT THAT IS THE CONVERSATION- THIS IS A NOT A NEW CONVERSATION. GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF THE BUILDING BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. THAT IDENTIFIED MANY MANY ISSUES WITH THE BUILDING. UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN UNDER MY PREDECESSOR OF IT WAS PROPOSED AND ADOPTED WE SHOULD REBUILD THE CAPITAL THAT IS TO SAY THE LEGISLATURE TO REBUILD THE ANNEX. THAT STATUTE WAS ADOPTED UNDER MY PREDECESSOR. RULES CHAIR RECORD IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND SO THERE HAS BEEN CONTINUING WORK OVER THIS TIME TO BRING FOR SORT OF A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT THIS PROJECT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND I DO WANT TO SAY TO ANYONE WHO'S FOLLOWING THIS. R. AS RULES CHAIR I REGARD MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO BRING SHAPE OF WHAT DECISIONS CAN BE MADE AND BRING THEM TO THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE AS I SAID IT THE IDEA TO REPLACE THE ANNEX OF AN UPDATED STRUCTURE WELCOMING TO THE PUBLIC. GETTING RID OF ASBESTOS AND OTHER SORTS OF THINGS ARE IS A LONGSTANDING IDEA- APPRECIATE IN. HE IS CHAIR AND THE CURRENT GOVERNOR- BUT- TODAY WE BRING THOSE THINGS TO THE COMMITTEE SO THE MEMBERS OF THE DRIVERLESS COMMITTEE LAST EVEN RECEIVED A PRESENTATION THAT IS GOING TO BE REVIEWED TODAY AND IT IS AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE- TODAY.

AND WHILE WE FACE CHALLENGES JUST OF OUR ABILITY TO MEET AND PARTICIPATE- WE ARE IN SOME STRICT TIMELINES TO DO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS AND I THINK ONE OF THE TAKEAWAYS TODAYWILL BE. THE DECISION MAKING THAT LIES IN FRONT OF US AND THAT GUIDING THAT IS GOING TO BE EXPANDED. PARTICIPATION AND ACCESS AS THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED WITH PARTICIPATION ALWAYS FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE'LL HEAR HOW A LOT OF THESE DESIGN FEATURES EXPAND TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF THOUGHT GIVEN TO SECURITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT VISITORS GUESTS STAFF AND MEMBERS- AND THAT WE WILL HEAR HAS GONE HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE DESIGN FEATURES OF INCLUSION. AND PARTICIPATION AND FINALLY I THINK WE'LL HEAR SOME UPDATES TO ABOUT HOW USE OF SPACE WILL ACTUALLY LEAD TO SOME EXPANDED PARK SPACE IN. USAGE OF THE PARK AREAS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VISITING THE CAPITAL- WEATHERED SCHOOL GROUPS OR GROUPS HERE TO VOICE AN OPINION ON ANY PARTICULAR LEGISLATION SO. WELL WE FACE THE CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW THE FIRES BURNING IN OUR STATE OF THE ON GOING PANDEMIC. MAYBE THE WORK HERE GIVES US AN ABILITY TO LOOK FORWARD.

HE HAS HELD VARIOUS STATES AND UNION REBUILD THEIR CAPITAL AND BRING IT IN ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. SO IT'S A- UNIQUE SKILL SET HE STILL SITS ON THE ROLE OF OWNER'S REPRESENTATIVE. SO THAT WE HAVE SOMEBODY EXPERTS IN THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS WHO IS STANDING IN THE PLACE OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE. AND PURSUING.

BUT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TODAY IS A VERY GOOD REPRESENTATION OF- THE DIRECTION THAT THE PROJECT COULD HEAD AND THAT THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IS REMARKABLE SO WITH THAT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TAKE A MINUTE TO INTRODUCE THE TEAM THAT IS GOING TO BE PRESENTING TO YOU FIRST I'D- LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE TELL YOUR RUCKER SHE'S HIDING BEHIND THIS MONITORS YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP OVER. TELL YOU IS TELL YOUR IS THE PROJECT COORDINATOR FOR OUR OFFICE AND SHE'S ALSO OVERSEEING SOME OF THE SCHEDULING FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT FOR US AND SOCIAL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT LATER ABOUT THE SCHEDULE I'D ALSO LIKE TO TURN SOME TIME OVER TO THE VISITOR CENTER- TEAM AND CON WITH- MARK KEVIN ARNOLD'S OFFICE WILL INTRODUCE HIS TEAM. YOU WANNA GO AHEAD AND JUST AND IT WAS. THE. WOOD MARK EVANIER ASSOCIATES INTO MY LAP IN THE ALLEY NOW HE REMEMBERS PROJECT ARCHITECT AND WILL MARK AVENIR SO SHE HAD. AND JEFF HERE DEENEY WOULD PLAN CONSTRUCTION- WHO IS THE LEAFLET FOR OUR TEAM. K. THANK YOU AND YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE- VISITOR CENTER AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION AND I HOPE YOU FIND THAT INTERESTING. I'D ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE ON MY RIGHT THE- DESIGN TEAM FOR THE ANNEX- IT'S MADE UP OF- TWO ORGANIZATIONS ALL HAVE JOSE INTRODUCED THE TEAM IF YOU WOULD. YES YES THEY WERE CAN YOU HEAR ME. YEAH MY NAME IS A SAMPLE LOSSES AND DESIGN DIRECTOR AT THE FIRM OF SKIDMORE OWINGS AND MERRILL. TO MY RIGHT HERE'S CHLOE LOVES. AN ASSOCIATE THAT TIME AND- FURTHER DOWN IS- GRANT REFUNDING ANYTHING EXECUTIVE WITH TURNER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. THAT'S GREAT. SO I'M GOING TO TURN SOMETIME OVER TO JOSE TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY. WE WILL THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW THE PROJECT HAS KIND OF COME ABOUT. WE WILL THEN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VISITOR CENTER THEN WILL MOVE INTO THE ANNEX. AND THEN WE'LL WRAP IT UP AND TURN IT BACK OVER FOR SOME QUESTIONS SO JOSE. LET YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON AND ON BEHALF OF- BOTH THE COVER THEIR OLD PLANT TEAM OF PHILADELPHIA FIND MATT TURNER TEAM- LIKE I HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY- WHAT- THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. IF YOU KNOW WILL BE TALKING OUT ABOUT WHAT PROJECTS- THE VISITOR CENTER HERE THE NOTED IN THE ORANGE. RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL. AND THAT AT THE REQUEST A PHEONIX REPLACEMENT WHICH YOU SEE HERE AND- WE ARE A LOT OF CAPITAL TO THE EAST DAVID- SORT OF MENTION A LITTLE BIT OF OUR AGENDA WHAT WE'RE GONNA TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON THE- PROJECT NICKENS IN HISTORY. THEN WILL- ADDRESS SOME OF THE- PRINCIPLES THAT WERE SET UP BY THE PROJECT OVERVIEW THINK WITH REPORT. AND I WILL ALSO ALK ABOUT FROM FIVE TEN CONSIDERATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE WE GET INTO A DETAILED PRESENTATION. OF THE OF THE VISITOR CENTER IN THE CAPITAL AND THEN. THEY WOULD WILL CLOSE IT UP WITH SOME UPDATES ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE SO WITH THAT. LIKE TO START WITH THAT LITTLE BIT OF THAT HISTORY AS ALL YOU DAHLE AT ABOUT THE CAPITAL PARK- SITS IN THE- CENTER OF SACRAMENTO. AND YOU CAN SEE A THREE NATION SHIP OF THE CITY CORRECT. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW THE AXES OF AXES THAT THIS BUILDING SETS UP. IN HOW IMPORTANT THAT RELATIONSHIP. IS TO THE REST OF THE CITY THE WEST AXIS BEING MORNING THAN THAT NOT ONLY SETS THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING BUT ALSO FITS. THAT DOOR AT IS SYMBOLICALLY THE FRONT DOOR OF. THE CALIFORNIA- SEAT OF GOVERNMENT. SO THESE A VERY VERY IMPORTANT AB FROM URBANISTIC ARCHITECTURAL. LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY THIS IS THE IMAGES OF- OF IT BUT CAPITAL IN ITS HISTORIC SETTING THE VERY BEGINNING OF IT HUNDRED AND KNOWLEDGE SEVENTY YEAR EXISTENCE I BELIEVE- IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES FIFTY SHADES- RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK. THAT AND IT'S DOME IS SLIGHTLY TILTED TOWARDS THE WEST TO MARK THE END OF THE WEST CORD IT EXPANSION AS WELL AS TO FAVOR. THE MORE IMPORTANT SIDE WHICH IS THE FRONT DOOR ON THE WEST SIDE. AND THEN TO THE LEFT THERE YOU SEE AN OVAL- THAT USED TO BE A YAK CARRIAGEWAY. THAT ALSO REINFORCES THAT AXES ANYTHING WHITE SAID THERE WAS ALSO AN APPROACH. TO THE BUILDING FROM THE EAST SIDE. A LITTLE BIT OF HIS HERE AND YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW AS THE BUILDING HAS INVOLVED THE NEEDED FROM. AS WE GO ALONG TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO. THE NEEDS OF THE TIME YOU CAN SEE HERE HOW TO CARRY TAXES. MOVE WAS REPLACED BY THE AUTOMOBILE ACTORS AND THEN. LATER ON IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO THE PROCESS GOT LARGER AS THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA. EXPANDED ANOTHER HERE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TURN OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NINETEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR. YOU CAN SEE HOW THE MATURE TREES THAT WERE RESPONDING TO THE ORIGINAL GEOMETRY OF THE OF THE PARK. I FRAMING THOSE VIEWS TO THE DOME. AS WELL AS THE PILOT WAS- THAT EXISTED NOT TODAY A LITTLE BIT FURTHER IMPORTS- USED TO BE MARKING THAT THRESHOLD- TENTH STREET THINK CREATING AN ENTRY TO THE PARK. AND THEN LASTLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AND OF THE CAPITALAND X. IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO. WITH NOTABLY AT THE INTRODUCTION OF PARTICULAR RAMPS TO ACCESS THAT BELOW GRADE PARKING. IN THIS IS AN IMAGE OF THE CAPITAL OF THE CITY TODAY- THIS IMAGE ALONE. IT PRESENTS- THAT. I THINK THAT HOW HOW SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT THIS PROJECT IT AND OBVIOUSLY IT TELLS ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO RESPECT THIS BILL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE SPENDING A LITTLE BIT OF THE HISTORY OF THIS BUILDING IF THAT SETTING IS THAT MANY THINGS HAVE HAD TO CHANGE TO ADAPT TO THE TIMES AND THAT THE IMPORTANT THING ST DOOR. AND THAT WE THINK THAT. THE BEST THING THAT WE CAN DO TO FOR THAT CONTINUED INTO INDOOR. IS TO ACTUALLY. RESERVE A BUILDING THAT IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL. AND EFFICIENT AS THE CALIFORNIA CITY GOVERNMENT. SO VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE TRANS FAT WE THINK. REGARDING THE ONYX- THERE WAS A REPORT AND I THINK OF MR COOLEY THE GERMAN COOLEY RISK- REFER TO THIS THE FINAL REPORT OF DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WHICH THE CALL OUT FOR A FEW DEFICIENCIES BY THE ONYX BECAUSE THAT THAT ARE IN NEED OF AFTER. AND THEY THEY RANGE FROM LIKE FIFTY TO ACCESSIBILITY. IN OVERCROWDING AS YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CIRCULATION PATHS ARE VERY CROWDED AT TIMES. AND THEN ALSO FROM THE WORK SPACE PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE MANY SHORTCOMINGS FOR THE SHORTCOMINGS BEING DEFICIENCY BUT MEETING SPACE- OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY. AND FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE ARE ARE PERHAPS- NOT WORKING SO WELL IN THE EXISTING ON. CONSEQUENTLY THE L. THE COMMITTEE YES. SHOW UP I NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ. HI CONSEQUENTLY- THE- PROJECT OVERVIEW IN SEQUENCE REPORT WAS- I ADOPTED TO NOT ADDRESS TWENTY NINETEEN AND THIS IS A THIS REPORT. I CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YEAH. YEAH THIS REPORTS- A STATES THIS PRINCIPLES I'M MORE ALONG. OTHER USEFUL DESIGN GUIDELINES THAT WILL. INFORM AT THE DESIGN TEAM ON HOW TO PROCEED AND WITH THE PROJECT. SO THE VERY FIRST OF THOSE PRINCIPLES IS TO BE INCLUSIVE AND WELCOME OBVIOUSLY I WAS CALIFORNIA AS A BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT BE INCLUSIVE AND. AND WELCOMING THAT'D BE INVITING. THAT'D BE TRANSPARENT IN THOSE OF ARCHITECTS SAY IT REQUIRES THAT THE BUILDING BE VERYPOOR. AND NOTHING BETTER. TO START THAT FEROCITY THAT WITH THE FRONT DOOR AS WELL AS MAINTAINING- THREE OTHER ENTRIES ON THE NORTH SOUTH AND EAST. THE VISITOR CENTER PERHAPS ENTRANCE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE THAT RESTORES THE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT. NEXT WILL BE THE ENTRANCE WILL HAVE SOME INTERESTING BILLS THAT WOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST IN THE SECURITY PROCESSES. AS WELL AS IN TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE VISITORS THE MEATS AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY AFFECT YOU. AND THAT IT WILL BE FULLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGHOUT BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. AS WE ACCESS THE BUILDING. THERE'S A NEED. TO RELIEVE THAT OVERCROWDING IN WE THINK THAT THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS A FEW COMMENTS INTO THE BUILDING IS TO HAVE A AMPLE- PUBLIC A SPACE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO BE SAFE- THAT THAT THAT CAN I BELIEVE THAT OVERCROWDING AND PEOPLE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS. AND THAT WILL BE. COMFORTABLE AND DIGNIFIED AND OBVIOUSLY IT ALSO- PEOPLE CAN FEEL PRIDE OFTEN THIS IS THIS IS THAT IT IMAGES OF VERY CONCEPTUAL IMAGES OF WHAT THAT THE SPACE MICHAEL TALK ABOUT. ONE IN THE VISITOR CENTER AND THE OTHER IN THE ONYX IN WILL BE ABLE TO REFER BACK TO THE- TO THE TO THE- DAHLE. ANOTHER OF THE PRINCIPLE THIS TO BE ONE BUILDING AND THAT REFERS BACK AS HAVING THE ABILITY TO CONNECT- BOTH THE HISTORIC BUILDING. AND THE AND THE AND THE NEW ANNEX AND NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAT THAN A LINING THE FLOORS SPECIFICALLY. TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND FORTH SEEMINGLY THEME AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT ALL FUNCTIONS AS ONE BUILDING. AND THEN IT DOESN'T PRINCIPLE THE CALL IT'S CALLED EDUCATION SEE TO EVERYTHING WHICH HE RELATES TO THE- TO FACILITATING A PRODUCTIVE- PRODUCTIVE WORK DAY AND ALL OF YOU THAT LIVE IN THIS BUILDING KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE CLOSE TO EVERYTHING. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TAKE- FROM THE EXISTING ONYX THAT. WE THINK THAT IT WORKS WELL AS A DAY BECAUSE THIS CONTINUOUS CIRCULATION NO DEAD ENDS. FIGURE EIGHT CIRCULATION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE IN THE U. YOUR TO GO TO WHERE YOU NEED TO BE FILLED. WOULD LIKE TO BRING THAT. INTO THE NEW NEW DESIGN AND BE ABLE TO CONNECT AND ON CONTINUOUS FLOW. AND THEN BE FUNCTIONAL AND OBVIOUSLY ALL FLOORS NEED TO BE FUNCTIONAL BUT THIS FLOOR THE SECOND FLOOR WERE SPENDING RIGHT NOW IS CRITICAL IN TERMS IT'S NOT WISHING THE CONNECTIONS OF THE ASSEMBLY TO THE REST OF THE FLOOR. AS WELL AS THIS THE SET THE ENTRY LEVEL FLOOR WE CALL THIS LEVEL. THE GARDEN LEVEL THIS IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THE- THE FIRST LEVEL OF THE ROTUNDA. BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE AS THEY COME IN AND HAVE A VERY GOOD WAY FINDING- WAIT TO GET INTO THE BUILDING. SO WITH THAT I LIKE TO. PASS IT ON TO MY COLLEAGUE- CHLOE LOGS THAT THEY WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE SITE IN SOME OF THE. THANK YOU JOSE. SO THE CAPITOL BUILDING IS DESIGNED TO SET SLIGHTLY ELEVATED ABOUT THE POCK AND THIS IS BOTH TO PROTECT IT FROM FLOODING BUT ALSO TO GIVE IT ITS CIVIC PRESENCE AND THAT'S CIVIC PRESENCE IS FURTHER ENHANCED BY THE GEOMETRY OF THE POCK WHEREVER YOU'RE STANDING THE PODS DIRECTING POINTS OF VIEWS TOWARDS THE CAPITAL TO. AND ALTHOUGH TODAY THOSE POTS AND JAVA TREES HAVE CHANGED SLIGHTLY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE AND ENHANCE THOSE VIEWS ARE VERY MUCH STILL PRESENT. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY IS TO REINFORCE THE HISTORICALLY THE HISTORICAL PROMINENCE OF THE AXES AND ESPECIALLY THE WEST IT'S AXES. BY REINSTATING AND REINFORCING THE WEST ENTRY WHICH TODAY IS AND USE. AS WELL AS REINFORCING THE EAST ENTRY. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY AND READY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IS THIS IDEA THAT THE CAPITAL IS A BUILDING WITHIN A POCK AND THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE DESIGN TEAM AND MAXIMIZING IN HAN SAYING AND PROTECTING THE PARK IS ONE OF UTMOST PRIORITIES. RIGHT NOW THE EXISTING THE EXISTING RAMPS DOWN TO THE PARKING READY BIFURCATE THE POCK AND IMPEDE A FREE AND EASY FLOW OF CIRCULATION FOR PEDESTRIANS. HOWEVER WE SEE A READY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO RELOCATE THOSE RAMPS. AND THEREFORE COMPLETELY RECONNECT THE POCK READY ALLOWING. PEDESTRIANS TO SAFELY ONE THE POP CONNECTING THE SIDE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE POT. WHICH WE THINK IS A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO THE PROJECT. AND BECAUSE THE CAPITAL IS- SLIGHTLY ELEVATED FROM ITS NEIGHBORING STREETS THIS NEW POP CONNECTION REALLY HELPS US FACILITATE TRUE UNIVERSAL ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE SITES AS WELL AS INTO THE BUILDING. ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION OF THE TREATIES. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DEDICATED IN LARGE TREES AROUND THE SITE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE A HANDFUL OF DEDICATED SMALL TREES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE ANNEX BUT CAN BE EASILY RELOCATED. THE REMAINDER OF THE TREES ON THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH AND NOT IMPACTED AT ALL BY THE FOOTPRINT OF THE ANNEX AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A BIT LATER. HOWEVER THE FOOTPRINT OF THE PARKING WAS A BIT MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE DESIGN TEAM AND WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. WE LOOKED AT LOCATING IT ON THE SOUTH SIDE. AS WELL AS ON THE NORTH SIDE AND AS YOU CAN SEE BOTH LOCATIONS IMPACT THE TREES QUITE SEVERELY. AS WELL AS BOTH OF THEM REQUIRING A SECOND MEANS OF EGRESS WHICH WOULD MEAN FURTHER IMPACTING THE POP AND TUNNELLING UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING. AND SO THE DESIGN TEAM SAID ON A ON A LOCATION TO THE EAST WEAVING THE PARKING- BELOW THIS PAUL STREET RIGHT OF WAY AND READY HAVING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF IMPACT ON THE TREES. AND HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BASEMENT PLAN UP THE PARKING. YOU CAN SEE HOW WE'VE LOCATED THE RAMPS TO THE PREFERRED TO THE PERMIT UP IN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH AGAIN READY MAXIMIZING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY WITHIN THE POP. AND WE HAVE READY TIA TWO ENTRIES FROM AND THEN L. STREET. AS WELL AS A TWO MEANS OF EGRESS BOTH OF WHICH COULD BE EASILY REVERSED OF THE CITY STREETS CHANGE. AND ANOTHER GREAT PET BENEFITS OF LOCATING THE PARKING AT IS THAT THE LEAD OF THE PARKING CAN BECOME A READY GREAT PEDESTRIAN PROMENADE THAT CONNECTS. ALLEN N. STREET ANY SENSUALLY CONNECTS A PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE TO THE LARGEST CITY GRID. AND SO HAVING THIS READY VIABLE WEST ENTRY YOU CAN CONNECTING- VISITORS THROUGH CAPITOL MALL STRAIGHT INTO THE VISITOR CENTER ON THE WEEK. ON THE WEST ALONG WITH THE ENTRY ON THE EAST READY REINFORCES THAT HISTORICAL AXES THE WESTIES AXES. AND BECAUSE WE ALREADY MAKING A TRULY ACCESSIBLE CONTINUE WITH POP- ENTRY TO THE GROUNDS IS ACCEPTABLE FROM ALL OF US FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE CAPITOL PARKING ON THE NORTH AS WELL AS THE AYE LOBBY ON THE SOUTH. WE'RE ALSO ALLOWING FOR TO A GROUPS AND SCHOOL BUSES TO BE ABLE TO TALK DIRECTLY ON TENTH STREET AND EASILY AND SAFELY FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE VISITOR CENTER FROM THE WEST. AND IF FOR ANY REASON THE VISITOR CENTER IS DELAYED. THESE SCHOOL BUSES ENTER GROUPS WILL BE ABLE TO POP IN FIFTEEN THREE TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH CAPITOL PARK AND INTO THE BUILDING ON THE EAST. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO A COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THEIR ARCHITECT. ON KENYAN ATTY ORMERECE. THANK YOU CLOSELY. MY NAME IS KHAN KEYON WITH KEVIN AIR ASSOCIATES COLLEEN ALLEY TO DO BEFORE. WILL BE TAKING YOU GUYS THROUGH THE VISITS SAID THE PROJECT- WE HEAR ON BEHALF OF PLAN. PLAN CONSTRUCTION CATHARINE PICK KEVIN HERE TEAM. SO THIS IS A SITE PLAN SHOWING THE VISITOR CENTER WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE. TO THE LEFT OF THE WEST WING BUILDING. AND WHAT ONE WANTED TO AGAIN POINT NOW IS THE ONLY INDICATION OF THE AXIS- NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST. IN THE BUSINESS CENTER IS LOCATED DIRECTLY. ON THE EAST WEST AXIS CONNECTING W. QUARTER TO THE CAPITOL MALL. AND BECAUSE THE TONE SHIFTED WESTWARD TRADITIONALLY THE PUBLIC ENTRANCE ON THE WEST SIDE. THE BUSINESS CENTER AND NATURALLY WILL SERVE AS A NEW PUBLIC ENTRANCE- AND AGAIN FROM THE WEST SIDE. WELL WE WANT TO ALSO POINT OUT IS. BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING THE BUSINESS CENTER BELOW GRADE. WE ARE REALLY RETAINING THE IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREE BUILDINGS ON THE SITE ACROSS TRENTON STREET THE ON REBUILDING THE MOSQUE BUILDING. THOSE WITH BILL- MEANT TO COMPLEMENT THE CAPITOL BUILDING SO WE RETAINING THAT IMPORTANT. RELATIONSHIP. AND BY BY ADDING A DROP OFF ZONE ON TENTH STREET FOR SCHOOL BUSES- VISITORS- THE NEW DROP OFF AREA REALLY ALLOW IT YOU I THINK FOR ME FOR THE FIRST TIME. TO REALLY MAKE A STRONG CONNECTION TO THE MONUMENTS ACROSS TENTH STREET. SO YOU HAVE- YOU HAVE A COUPLE MONUMENT YOU GOT THE FOUNTAIN AND THEN WE WILL BE REPLACING RELOCATING BACK- THE- COMMAND CAMON CAMON COMMEMORATIVE SEALS- THAT'S ON THE PLAZA RIGHT NOW IN ITS CURRENT LOCATION. SO THE EXISTING PLAZA IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. AND THE NEW PLAZA WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN TWO PIECES THE OF THE OPERA PLAZA IN AS A LOCALIZA IT'S ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE FEET SO SLIGHTLY LARGER. AND WHAT IT'S ALLOWING US TO DO. IS RETAINING THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP TO THE CAPITOL MALL BUT ENHANCING THE CIRCULATION OF THE AND THE SAFER WAY TO CROSS TEN STREET- BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING A BOLD OUT. MAKING THE CROSSING EASIER CREATING A DROP. SAFE FOR BUSES AND SCHOOL CHURN AND WE ENHANCING THE CIRCULATION WITHIN THE PARK- WITH TWO DIFFERENT PLAZA- THERE'S DEDICATED ENTRANCE SPACE INTO THE BUSINESS CENTER IN THE WEST WING. AND ALLOWING. STILL THE ACTIVITIES THAT MIGHT OCCUR ON PLAZA EVENTS GATHERING PROTESTS- WITHOUT. IMPEDING ON THE PROPERTY. SO THIS IS PERSPECTIVE. OF THE- THE NEW VISITORS CENTER YOU CAN SEE THAT. THE CAPITOL BUILDING- WHAT JOSE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THE TREES THE GROUNDS AND THE PROMINENCE IN THE DOME NONE OF THAT IS IMPEDED. IN A VIEW FROM CAPITOL MALL- SHOWING THE DROP OFF ZONE HOW IT'S PROTECTED AND SECURE- WOULD POLITICS AND FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME THIS ALLOW FOR ACCESSIBLE ENTRANCE INTO THE WEST WING- FROM THE WEST PORTAL WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE TOOK A GREAT CARE TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE MATURE CEDAR TREES TO THE LEFT TO RIGHT. AND AS YOU GET CLOSER YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE- INTENDS TO BRING BACK THE PILLARS OF THE MONUMENTS TO THE ORIGINAL HISTORICAL CATIONS MARKING THE ENTRANCE. INTO THE PUBLIC- ENTRANCE INTO THE EXHIBIT SPACE. SEVEN AS YOU GET CLOSER- YOU CAN SEE LEGEND SHIPPING UP APPLAUSE AND A LITTLE PLAZA- IN. THERE IS A NOW A OVERHANG SPACE FOR QUEUING THERE SO YOU'RE PROTECTED FROM THE ELEMENTS. THE ENTRANCE THE DESIGNED TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT VERY WELCOMING- WE REALLY WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE SPACE YOU WANT TO BE. SO NOW WE'RE MOVING INTO THE FLOOR PLAN. SO TO THE LEFT IS THE BUSINESS CENTER MIDDLE. EAST THE EXISTING WEST WING CAPITOL BUILDING AND THEN TO THE. LEFT TO RIGHT IS THE ANNEX. SO THE END INCOMING OF THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM IS REALLY INTENT INTENDED TO ALLEVIATE A LOT OF THE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN MENTIONED IN THE BLUE BOOK- CONGESTIONS INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES AND A HOST OF THE ISSUES SO. THIS WHOLE PLAN IS SHOWING IS IN THE MIDDLE THERE'S A VERY LARGE SECURITY QUEUING SPACE AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE IS A GATHERING SPACE RECOMPOSE SPACE FOR YOU TO GET ORGANIZED SO FOR TOUR GROUPS- THIS MAY BE A ROUTE THAT YOU WOULD YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO DO TO EXPERIENCE THE BUILDING SAYS YOU COME IN THROUGH SECURITY YOU MAY TURN LEFT NORTH OF UPPER SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND WHERE THE ORIENTATION ROOMS OR- OR YOU MAY CHOOSE TO GO DOWN WHICH IS THE BOTTOM. OF A CELL- TO VISIT EXHIBIT SPACE- OR IF YOU COME IN THE BUS GROUP UP THE LONG LONG BUS RIDE YOU MAY WANT TO GO TO THE RESTROOMS WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER FOR VISITORS. WHO JUST WANT TO GO INTO THE WEST WING ON THE ANNEX DIRECTLY. THEY CAN PROCEED. PRETTY IN A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD MANNER UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOWER TANDA. AND ANGLE OF ELEVATORS OR STAIRS INTO THE WEST WING OR CONTINUE ON INTO THE ANNEX BUILDING. THERE'S AN ACCESSIBLE PATH OF TRAVEL AS WELL. SO WE ARE CONTEMPLATING THE BUILD OUT OF BUSINESS CENTER IN TWO PHASES THEIR FIRST RACE WHAT WE CALL KORN SHELL. WHICH IS THE ENTIRE FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING AND THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE SECURITY QUEUING. GATHERING SPACE. S. ROOMS AND ALL THE MECHANICALS FACES AND ALSO WILL NEED TO DO SOME WORK ON THE WEST WING SORRY IN ORDER TO MAKE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE VISITORS CENTER AND THE WEST WING BUILDING. FOR FACE TO WHICH IS PRIMARILY TENANT IMPROVEMENT WOULD BE EXHIBIT AN ASSOCIATE SPACES- AS WELL AS THE ORIENTATION GROUPS. SO AT THIS POINT I'M GOING TO HAND OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE NATALIE. GOOD AFTERNOON. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS A SECTION CUT THROUGH THE SITE STARTING WITH TEN STRAIGHT ON MY LEFT A SLOPING WALKWAY BRINGS YOU DOWN% TO THE VISITOR CENTER BELOW UP IN INTO THE WEST WING. AND THROUGH TO THE ANNEX. HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT HAVE YOU TAKEN WITHIN THE QUEUING AREA. LOOKING PAST SECURITY AND THROUGH TO THE WEST WING. A LARGE OVERHEAD SKYLIGHT BRINGS DOWN NATURAL DAYLIGHT INTO THE SPACE AS WELL AS PROVIDES DIRECT VIEWS TO THE STARK THE SIDE OF THE WEST WING ABOVE. THIS CONNECTION IS FURTHER REINFORCED THE ARTICULATION OF THE OPENINGS OF THE PARTICLE ABOVE BEING BROUGHT DOWN TO THIS VISITOR CENTER LEVEL. FROM THE SPACE THERE'S ALSO VIEWS INTO THAT EXHIBIT SPACE WHICH IS ENVISIONED TO HAVE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT CONTACT. THIS VIEW OF THE EXHIBITS AS WELL AS THE WEST WING BEING AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE VISITOR ENTRY REALLY SEEKS TO CREATE A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT AND ANTICIPATION AS WELL AS CLEAR WAYFINDING. HERE'S A VIEW LOOKING FROM THAT SAME SPACE BUT NOW UP IN TOWARDS THE DOME. THIS ICONIC VIEW OF THE HISTORIC FACADE REALLY IS INTEGRAL TO YOUR SENSE OF ARRIVAL. AND ENTRY INTO THE CAPITAL. THIS IS A VIEW TAKEN FROM THE EXHIBITS ENTRY. LOOKING TO EXHIBIT SO THE RIGHT AND THE GATHERING SPACE ON THE LEFT AND THE WEST WING TO THE FRONT. YOU'LL NOTICE HOW OPEN INCLUDE THE SPACES ARE TO ONE ANOTHER. AS YOU ENTER THE VISITOR CENTER. THE VIEW INTO THE EXHIBIT SPACE WILL PROVIDE VISUAL INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT. THE REALLY EXCITING TO ALL VISITORS TO REALLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO EXPLORE ENGAGE WITH THE CONTENT WITHIN THAT SPACE. THIS IS A VIEW OF THE GETTING SPACES WELL WE'RE NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE. OF THAT SPACE LOOKING TOWARDS THE WEST WING. SO THE GATHERING SPACES THE SPACE IMMEDIATELY AFTER SECURITY SO AFTER WE GOT THROUGH SECURITY. IF YOU WANT TO GROUP WITH THE GROUP YOU CAN CONTRAVENE THE CENTER NEEDED TO THE RESTROOMS THOSE ARE KIND OF BEHIND US IN THIS VIEW WORKING TO THE ORIENTATION ROOMS. YOU WANT HEAD STRAIGHT INTO THE WEST WING YOU MAY. GIVE ME A MOMENT TO GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS ARE THINGS YOU CAN HEAD TO THE LONG WINTER BENCH. LATER KICK INTO THE EXHIBITS OR YOU CAN ALSO CONGREGATE IN FRONT OF THE LARGE DIGITAL. WALL TO THE LEFT THE SPACE. THIS IS A VIEW- WERE NOW ON THE PATHWAY LEADING UP INTO THE WEST WING BUT NOW LOOKING BACK TOWARDS A VISITOR CENTER AND TRADE. FROM HERE YOU HAVE DIRECT VIEWS INTO ADDICTIVE SPACE YOU HAVE USE INTO THE MAIN ENTRY. OUT TO THE CALIFORNIA PLAZA. BEYOND AS WELL AS THE CAPITOL MALL. AND THEN TO THE RIGHT HE HAD VIEWS OF THAT DIGITAL WALL. THIS FINAL VIEW IS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM THE BASEMENT OF THE WEST WING WE'RE NOW ON THE LOWER RETURNED THE AREA LOOKING BACK OUT TOWARDS THE VISITOR CENTER. ENTRANCE BECAUSE HE DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AND THE STRONG VISUAL AND PHYSICAL CONNECTIVITY REALLY REINFORCES THE NOTION OF ONE BUILDING. LET'S NOT I'M GONNA TURN IT BACK OVER TO DAVID PART. WITH. THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A MINUTE NOW AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THE VISITOR CENTER ON THE CAPITAL OR THE- THE ANNEX AND- WHAT IF IT'S BUILT AND WHAT IF IT'S- NOT BUILT. SO THE FIRST THING I THINK TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE LOGIC BEHIND THE- THE VISITOR CENTER IS IT A D. CONFLICTS THE- CONGESTION THAT IS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE TODAY WITHIN THE CURRENT ANNEX AS YOU KNOW TODAY- ALL OF THE VISITORS AS WELL AS- MEMBERS AND EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKING HERE COMES THROUGH THE TWO PRIMARY DOORS NORTH AND SOUTH AND THERE'S A NEW STORE- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT CREATES PITCH POINTS AND IT CREATES CONFLICT- WITHIN THOSE MAJOR CORRIDORS. BY HAVING THE WEST ENTRY WE CAN TAKE THOSE- SCHOOL GROUPS TOUR GROUPS AND VISITORS AND HAVE THEM COME IN- GATHER AND GET READY FOR THEIR TOUR USE THE RESTROOMS AND THEN AND ORGAN MANNER TAKE THE TOUR AND GO THROUGH THAT WITHOUT CREATING A LOT OF CONGESTION FOR MEMBERS AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS SO IT IMPROVES THE CIRCULATION- BY PULLED TOGETHER AND ALLOWING FOR THE GROUPS TO ASSEMBLE AND THEIR LOGICAL LOCATIONS IT IMPROVED LEARNING BE IT ALLOWS FOR US TO DEVELOP EXHIBITS AND UNDERSTANDING ABOUT CALIFORNIA DEMOCRACY. WITHIN THE VISITOR CENTER TO WHERE THEY CAN TAKE THE TIME AND THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN STANDING IN THE HALLWAY IS LOOKING AT THE CURRENT EXHIBITS AND CONTESTING THAT AND IT IMPROVES THE OVERALL FUNCTION. OF THE ANNEX BY SEPARATING THESE TWO FUNCTIONS INTO THEIR APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS IT ALLOWS FOR THE- FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS AND THE SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT'S BEING BUILT IN THE ANNEX BEING USED. TO HELP- FURTHER THOSE ACTIVITIES AND IT ALLOWS FOR THE LEARNING CURRENTLY WE HAVE BROKEN THE VISITOR CENTER INTO TWO DISCRETE PHASES AS KONG MENTIONED. PHASE ONE IS WHERE WE BUILD THE SHELL OF THE BUILDING WE BUILD THE ENTRY PORTIONS WHERE THE SECURITY AS WE BUILD THE GATHERING PLACES. AND WE BUILD THE RESTROOMS WE BUILD THE CONNECTION TO THE- WEST WING- THE POS BUDGET AS- ADDENDA FIDE IN THE DOCUMENT WAS THIRTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE ARE CURRENTLY AT ABOUT FORTY POINT EIGHT AND- THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD WE BELIEVE THAT IF THIS PROJECT WAS TO MOVE FORWARD WE COULD FIND WAYS TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN IN WHAT'S CALLED THE CONCEPTUAL PHASE WHICH MEANING IS WERE RIGHT AT THE VERY BEGINNING WE STILL HAVE SCHEMATIC DESIGN AND DESIGN DEVELOPMENT CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS TO GO THROUGH. AND AS WE GET MORE INTO THE PROJECT AND WE LEARN MORE WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ABLE WILL BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN THAT BUDGET UP. PHASE TWO. IS REALLY THE EXHIBIT PHASE IN THIS IS NOT BEEN FUNDED- AS YOU YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THE- EXHIBITS WERE NOT PART OF THE APPROPRIATION AND SO THAT NEEDS TO STILL BE FUNDED. ONCE THE EXHIBITS ARE DETERMINED THEN WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF BUILD OUT WHAT KIND OF. FINISHES WE NEED WITHIN THE ORIENTATIONS ROOMS AND WITHIN THE EXHIBIT SPACE. OUR EXPECTATION AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE EXHIBIT PHASE. AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A NEW APPROPRIATIONS SO CURRENTLY THE IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING THE VISITOR CENTER ON HOLD WHICH IS WHERE IT CURRENTLY IS. IS THAT IT REQUIRES US TO INCREASE CERTAIN CIRCULATION ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE- THE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SPACE WITHIN THE SECURITY AREAS SO THAT WE CAN HANDLE THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING IN. RATHER THAN JUST HAVING THEM COME IN WITH THE NORMAL TRAFFIC SO THAT'LL INCREASE. IN SOME AREAS ONE TO TWO MAGNETOMETERS- WE ALSO NEED ADDITIONAL RESTROOMS TO BE PLACED- WHICH WILL CHEW UP A LITTLE BIT OF THE- FUNCTIONAL SPACE THAT'LL HAPPEN BOTH ON THE- GARDEN LEVEL AND ON THE FIRST FLOOR. AND THEN- THE BIGGEST IMPACT IS REALLY THE CIRCULATION SPACE BECAUSE WE NEED TO ACCOMMODATE APPROXIMATELY. A MILLION VISITORS A YEAR AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT ONCE THIS IS DONE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE FOR CAPITALS THAT WE HAVE DONE IS THE SPIKE OF VISITORS GOES THROUGH THE ROOF- IN UTAH WE SOUGHT TRIPLE. IN MINNESOTA WE SOUGHT DOUBLE IN IN WYOMING THEY SET RECORDS- FOR VISITORS- IN FACT WHEN WE OPEN TO WYOMING STATE CAPITOL THEY HAD PEOPLE. ALL THE WAY OUT ONTO THE LAWN AND DOWN THE STREET- THE LARGEST CROWD SAID THEY'D EVER SEEN SO. YOU WILL HAVE AN INCREASE IN VISITOR TRAFFIC SO THAT ONE MILLION VISITORS IS LIKELY TO GO UP. NOW WHETHER IT DOUBLES IT OR NOT I CAN'T SAY BUT- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ACCOMMODATE THE CIRCULATION CAPABILITIES WITH WITHIN THE BUILDING. THEREFORE WE HAVE. HAD TO ADD APPROXIMATELY YOUR USE APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. OR IT'S COSTING US ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OF THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ANYWAY TO- UTILIZE OUR TO PREPARE THE ANNEX TO RECEIVE. THOSE VISITORS. NOW WE HAVE DONE SOME STUDIES WITH REGARDS TO HOW THAT LAYS OUT SO ON THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE. IN THESE NEXT DIAGRAMS THE LAY OUT OF WHAT WE CALL THE DOUBLE T. AND WILL ALSO GO THROUGH THE CIRCLE IN THIS WHERE. BUT THAT'S THE SPACE THAT WE WOULD NEED TO ALLOCATE. IF THERE WAS. NO VISITOR CENTER IF WE BUILD THE VISITOR CENTER. THEN IN THE NEXTAG GRAHAM TO THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE THAT IN THE RED AREA WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE. AND VIRTUALLY SAVE THOSE DOLLARS FROM HAVING TO BUILD THAT. THE BLUE AREA IS SQUARE FOOTAGE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO REPURPOSE AND PUT BACK INTO THE FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS. TO WEAR BOTH ON THE GARDEN LEVEL WHICH IS WHERE THE HEARING ROOMS ARE AND ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHICH IS WHERE THE EXECUTIVE SUITES ARE. THEY WILL THEY'LL BE ABLE TO USE THAT FOR OFFICE FUNCTIONS OR FOR HEARING OR FUNCTIONS. AND SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IN ALL THREE OF THESE IT'S APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ABOUT. ELEVEN TO TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET COULD BE ELIMINATED THEREBY SAVING US SOME MONEY. AND APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FEET CAN BE REPURPOSED. AND SO IN THE DOUBLE T. YOU SAW THAT IN THE CIRCLE YOU CAN SEE WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REGAIN SOME OF THE- FUNCTIONAL SPACE. AND IN THE SQUARE YOU'LL SEE THAT NOW YOU'LL SEE MORE OF THESE DESIGNS IN A FEW MINUTES WHEN JOSE PRESENTS THOSE. IN SUMMARY WHAT THAT REALLY SAYS IS THAT WE CAN SAVE BETWEEN. TWO POINTS ONE POINT TWO MILLION AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. AND WE ARE ABLE TO REPURPOSE BETWEEN THREE POINT OR FOUR POINT SIX. FOUR FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. TO FOURTH- TWO THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET SO IT'S A- IT'S A GOOD BENEFIT TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE SPACES IN A IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO AS YOU SIT AND CONSIDER THIS TODAY WE RECOGNIZE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR DIRECTION- IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH REGARDS TO WHETHER YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS CONTIUE OR WHETHER YOU'D LIKE TO SEE A STAY ON HOLD. AND WITH THAT I WILL. TURN THE TIME OVER TO JOSE. WHO WILL TAKE US THROUGH THE DISCUSSION ON THE ANNEX. SO. I HEARD PLOY AND I WILL BE TAKING YOU THROUGH THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN- PUTTING TOGETHER FOR THE CAPITAL THE CAPITAL AND X. THE TEAM HAS PREPARED THAT- THREE ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER THIS CONCEPT TO CALL THE DOUBLE T. CIRCLE IN THE SQUARE. AND WE'RE GONNA PRESENT ADMIN- AND- IN THIS SORT OF FORMAT THE ALL THREE TOGETHER BECAUSE AS THEY RESPOND TO THE PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES SET UP BY THE P. O. S. AS WELL AS THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PROGRAMMATIC- ELEMENTS. THEY'RE VERY SIMILAR- HOWEVER. THEY ALSO AVE SOME- DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES FOR THE WILL LIKE TO POINT OUT TO YOU. SO THE THREE IMAGES THE BOTTOM- YOU KNOW POINT OUT HOW. THE THAT PNEUMATIC SORT OF SITS IS TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE OF THE WEST WING AND NESTLED IN BETWEEN THE TREES. AND THAT IT IS- YOU KNOW- RESPECTFUL OF THE HISTORIC BUILDING. ALL THREE OF THE SCHEMES ALLOW FOR THAT TACK CRITICAL PRODUCTION CONNECTION THAT KHLOE MENTIONED AND WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT BENEFIT. TO THE PROJECT INTO THE PARK. SO ALL THREE DO THAT THEY ALSO. HAVE MAINTAIN THOSE VIEWS TO THAT TO THAT DAHLE MAY NEED SOME CASES- MAYBE ENHANCE IT A LITTLE BIT. YES. VERY. THE LITTLE BLACK HOURS. AND OTHER THE PALM TREE SORRY THE RESOLUTION ON THE SCREEN IS NOW. YEAH YEAH YES. YEAH WHERE ARE SHOWING THE- AT RIGHT LOCATION OF ALL THE TREES THAT CAREFULLY SURVEYED THAT FILL ALL THE TREES ARE YOU SEE IN OUR IMAGES ARE IN THE RIGHT LOCATION AT THE RIGHT TIME. ALL OF THE SCHEME IS ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVEAL- A PORTION OF THE WEST WING FACADE THAT NOW IS COVERED BY BY THE ONYX- SO WE THINK THAT IS ALSO A BENEFIT- THAT THAT NEW PROJECT WILL BRING. ALL THREE SCHEMES OF THREE CONCEPTS- ALSO STATE WAY BELOW THE AT WHAT WE CALL THE ONE TWENTY FIVE FOOT LINE WHICH IS MARKING THE BOTTOM. OF THE COLONNADE OF THAT ON THE DOME SO NOT NON OF THE BUILDING ELEMENTS WOULD GO TO ALL BE GOING ABOVE THAT. ALL THREE SCHEMES ALSO ARE RELATING TO THE SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE WEST WING MAINLY THE CORNERS AND THE TOP OF THE BOTTLE STRAIGHT. THEY ALSO REVEAL A BIT BACK YOU CAN SEE THERE IN THE PLAN- FROM THE WEST WING TO SET IT UP OPPOSITE MORE IMPORTANT TYPE OF BUILDING THERE FOR. OUR PHRASE THAT WE USE THAT THIS CALL THAT THE WEST WING NEEDS TO BE FIRST AMONG EQUALS. AND IT OBVIOUSLY WORKED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE SURROUNDING TREES BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE OVERALL COMPOSITION. AND THEY HELP US SET UP THE WEST WING ALSO AS THE MOST IMPORTANT- BUILDING AT ON THE FIVE. ALL THREE SCHEMES- CAPITALIZE ON ON ACCESS TO DAYLIGHT IMPUSO WHO OBVIOUSLY OF ALL THE SPACES THAT ARE ABOVE GROUND THERE'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN THE DOUBLE T. AND THE CIRCLE IN THE SQUARE IN THAT THAT DOUBLE T. IS LOOKING OUTWARDS MOST OF THE STATE WITH THE WORK SPACES AT LOOKING OUTWARDS. WHEREAS IN THE CIRCLE AND IN THE SQUARE AT% BOTH- INWARDS AND OUTWARDS VIEWS WILL BE PROVIDED. YOU CAN SEE THERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE A NEW WORD FOR YOU THEY'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK INTO THIS COURTYARD AND HAVE USED TO THE TO THE DAHLE. AND THEN THE ODD WORD BE WITH WILL BE OBVIOUSLY TO THE PARK AND THE THREE. ALL THE THREE SCHEMES- HAVE ADOPTED THE CNCEPT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT IS BROUGHT ABOUT FROM FROM THE EXISTING IONIC SIX THAT ARE. THE HEAD CONTINUOUS CIRCULATION. AND ALL THE OBVIOUSLY THAT IS BROUGHT IN INTO THE CHAMBERS AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE WEST WING AS WELL. VERTICALLY ALL THREE SCHEMES WILL HAVE- THREE GROUPS OF ELEVATOR I MEAN FOR GROUPS OF ELEVATORS THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED WRONG ARE ALONG THE FLOORS-TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL FLOORS. AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ENTRYWAYS CONVERGE AT THE NEXUS OF IT WILL HAVE. ALSO A PUBLIC STAIRWAY- THAT WILL CONNECT BOTH ALL THE FLOORS OF THE WEST WING IN ALL THE FLOORS. ON THE NEW IPHONE X. THIS IS SPACE THAT WE'RE USING TO PUT THE STAIRWAY IS- REMINISCENT OF- THE OLD APPS THAT WITH STAKING OUT WHEN THE NINETEEN FIFTY TO ANNEX WITH IN. SO WE'RE TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF THAT HISTORY INTO THE NEW PROJECT. AND THEN HEAR SOME VIEWS OF WHAT THAT IS THERE MIGHT LOOK LIKE- OBVIOUSLY WILL LIKE TO PUT FROM ACCESS TO DAYLIGHT AT THE TOP AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO. RECALL THE DOME. IF YOU WALK UP THE STAIRS THERE'S A SPARE WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT AND FOR VISITORS TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE ENTRY LEVEL WHAT WE CALL THE GARDEN LEVEL. UP TO THE ROTUNDA LEVELING EVEN TO THE SECOND LEVEL AND THEN OTHER USERS IN THE IT AND THE STAFF AND VISITORS WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS. USE THE SPARE. FOR CIRCULATION BETWEEN FLOORS. WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FLOOR ALIGNMENTS ALL THREE SCHEMES ARE DOING JUST THAT IT. HOWEVER WE'VE- I DID A MEZZANINE RIGHT ON TOP OF THE SECOND FLOOR BECAUSE WE WERE BUILDING QUITE A BIT OF VOLUME- BECAUSE OF THE ALIGNMENT. OF THE OF THE OF THE FLOORS TO THE KING TO THE WEST WING WE WERE ALREADY HAVING THAT ABILITY TO INSERT A MEZZANINE THERE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE EFFICIENCY OF THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE BUILDING. PROGRAMMATIC LEE- ALL OF THE WORK SPACE ESPECIALLY THE MEMBER SWEETS AND ALL OF SUPPORT THE SPACES WILL BE LOCATED FROM THE SECOND FLOOR UP WITH OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT AT CONNECTION TO CHAMBERS ON THE SECOND FLOOR. THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR WILL BE ASSIST NOW IN THE FIRST FLOOR. ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN THERE. AND THEN THESE NEWLY DEVELOPED FLOOR THAT WE CALL THE GARDEN LEVEL THAT HAS ACCESS. TO TWELVE THREE RIGHT AWAY YOU MIGHT REMEMBER CHLOE TOLD US THAT THIS BUILDING IS A SLIGHTLY- PERCHED UP ABOVE THE SURROUNDING STREETS SO THAT FACILITATES. AN ENTRY RIGHT- BELOW THE FIRST LEVEL AT IT WHICH IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PUT ALL OF THE HIGHLY ACCESS- THE SPACES THAT NEED YOU HAVE A LOT OF ACCESS FROM THE PUBLIC PERSPECTIVE WHICH ARE THE HERE ROOMS FOR ALL THE KIßM HEARING RIVER LOCATED IN THIS FLOOR. AND THAT GIVES US ALSO AN ADVANTAGE FROM A LIFE SAFETY PERSPECTIVE IN THAT WE CAN EXIT A STRAIGHT OUT. ONTO THE TO THE SIDEWALK. AND THEN LASTLY THE BASEMENT BASEMENT THAT HOUSES- SOME- COMMITTEE ROOMS AS WELL AS OTHER SUPPORT SPACES. AND ALSO PROVIDES- AT- AN ENTRY FROM THE PARKING INTO THE BUILDING. WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT PUBLIC FACING THE PORTENTS OF THIS PUBLIC SPACE YOU CAN SEE HERE- SOME OF THE IMAGES BELOW WHAT THAT. MIGHT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE HOWEVER SOME DIFFERENCES THE DOUBLE T. IS A NARROW AND- VERY TALL ATRIUM SPACE WHERE THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE OF THE SPACE AND AT EVERY LEVEL. IN OTHER WORDS THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO. BE LOOKING DOWN INTO THE SPACE YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY FROM THE TOP OR OR AT ANY LEVEL THAT ONE. THERE AT THAT WHEREAS THE CIRCLE AND A DOUBLE P. AS MORE OF A BROADER TYPE OF SPACE MORE ABOUT A CALL IN THE PUBLIC ROOM. BUT IT ALSO ONLY CONNECTS- THAT CARD LEVEL IN THE FIRST LEVEL SO IT'S A TWO STORY. INSTEAD OF- ALL THE WAY UP. EIGHT THE VIEW A LITTLE BIT SO BECAUSE THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SCHEME. HERE'S A DOUBLE T. AND- IN THAT IN THAT. IMAGE IT THERE TOO TO THE RIGHT THERE'S A PRECEDENT IMAGE. OF A ONE OF A PROJECTS THAT WE'VE DONE WITH A SIMILAR TYPE OF THE SPACE YOU CAN SEE HOW. THE CIRCULATION AND IS BARCLAYS WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO THAT A SPACE AT EVERY LEVEL. AND THEN HERE'S WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE CIRCLE- IS ONLY A TWO STORY SPACE CONNECTING THE GARDEN LEVEL AGAIN WITH THE WITH THE EXECUTIVE FLOOR. SO IT'S MORE OF A GALLERY TYPE SPACE PERHAPS COULD BE USED FOR SOME EXHIBIT SPACE. AND THEN IT'D BE CAPPED WITH WHAT WE CALL A LADY LIKE TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY A SKYLIGHT THAT IS LOWER. THAN THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. ALL THE UPER FLOORS WILL BE A LITTLE MORE INDEPENDENTLY SAY FROM THIS PUBLIC SPACE DONE. AND DONE THE DOUBLE PHD. LIKEWISE THE SQUARE IS- IT ARRANGES SIMILAR NATURE JUST THE JAVA TREES DIFFERENT. WITH THAT I LIKE TO CALL BACK- CHLOE TO GO THROUGH SOME ENTRY SEQUENCE. SO YEAH WE'RE LOOKING AT A CROSS SECTION OF THE DOUBLE T. AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH AN ENTRY SEQUENCE OF ALL THREE SCHEMES STARTING WITH THE DOUBLE T. SO YOU CAN SEE AS YOU ARRIVE ON THE EAST YOU'RE GREETED WITH VERY VISIBLE VIEWS OF THE DOME. AND THIS IS BOTH FOR AWAY FINDING TOOL BUT ALSO FOR HIS STARK REVERENCE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING. THIS IS A VIEW JUST OFF THE SECURITY AS YOU'RE ABOUT TO APPROACH THE PUBLIC SPACE. AND HERE IS THE PUBLIC SPACE YOU CAN SEE THIS AMPLE DAY LIVES. THIS FRAME VIEWS TO THE DOME AND- THAT'S WHAT THEY MENTIONED. THE SPACE IS ACTIVATED ALL THE WAY UP SO THIS. TRULY BECOMES THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. AND THEN THIS IS A VIEW FROM ONE LEVEL UP. THIS IS- THE ENTRY TO THE GOVERNOR'S SUITE. SO YOU CAN SEE IS READY GRAN SPACE LOOKING DOWN ON TO THE PUBLIC SPACE LOOKING UP TO THE DOME AND LOOKING DIRECTLY AHEAD IN FRONT OF YOU YOU CAN SEE. THE VIEW STRAIGHT INTO THE WEST WING. AND THEN SIMILARLY WITH THE CIRCLE. AS YOU APPROACH THE CIRCLE YOU SEE GLIMPSES OF THAT DOME. AND THEN THIS IS A VIEW STRAIGHT OFF TO THE SECURITY YOUR LEADS THROUGH A CORRIDOR INTO THAT SECULAR PUBLIC SPACE. IN THIS WE THINK COULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY A FLEXIBLE SPACE PERHAPS FULL- TEMPORARY OLE PERMANENT EXHIBITS FOR GALLERY FULL FULL MOTIFS I'M- AND THEN THIS IS THE VIEW FALLOUT FROM THE LEVELUP AGAIN FROM THE GOVERNOR SPACE LOOKING BACK DOWN ONTO THAT. ROUND FACE AND LOOKING STRAIGHT THROUGH INTO THE WEST WING. AND THEN AGAIN VERY SIMILAR TO THE CIRCLE YOU SEE THE SQUARE THE APPROACH FROM THE EAST. AS YOU'RE COMING OUT FROM SECURITY AND YOU'RE LED INTO THE PUBLIC SPACE WITH VIEWS UP TO THE DOME. AND AGAIN A FLOOR UP ON THE FIRST FLOOR FROM THE GOVERNOR'S ENTRY. AND I'M GONNA GIVE IT BACK TO JOSE AND I'M GOING TO. WELL JOSE'S TALKING I'M GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE MODEL AND SPEND THE MODEL A LITTLE. MMHM. THIRTY TWO- PLAY MUSICAL CHAIRS MIGHT WE THOUGHT THAT IS SPEAKING THROUGH A MASK- MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT THAT THAT DIFFICULT BECAUSE SO- WILL HAVE I'M I'M GONNA TAKE OVER NOW IN THAT BAG WALK YOU THROUGH- GOING COUNTER TOP THROUGH THE SITE AND- CHLOE WILL BE SPINNING THE MODEL KIND OF TRYING TO ORIENT YOU IF YOU CAN SEE IT. AND THERE SO HERE'S THE FIRST FEW. WE'RE LOOKING- FROM THE SOUTHWESTAPPLE TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING AND YOU CAN SEE THAT- BOTH THAT DOUBLE T. IN THE CIRCLES TO RECEIVE BACK A LITTLE BIT TO IN AND BEHIND THE CAPITAL MAKING IT. A LITTLE BIT MORE PROMINENT WEARS A SQUARE IS MORE OF A FLASH CONDITION IN A LET IT ALIGNING WITH THAT WITH THAT SOUTH AND NORTH. FOR FIVE. IT IS A BIT MORE- THEY SAY- IN PARALLEL WITH THE CAPITAL. THIS IS A VIEW NOT LOOKING IS STRAIGHT- ISTA ON THE NEWLY. THE NEW- SO PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY THAT WILL BE RECONNECTING- THE CAPITOL GROUNDS WITH THE PARK. A IN HERE YOU CAN SEE ALSO THAT THAT RESET RECEIVE THAT THAT. THAT THE DOUBLE T. FOR EXAMPLE RECEIVED BACK THERE IN THE MIDDLE A LITTLE BIT TO ALLOW THE CAPITAL TO BE MORE PROMINENT AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY GIVING US- TREES ON THE SOUTH AND MAINLY THE NORTH OPEN THE MOON TREE AND SO FORTH A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM. AT WHAT THAT DOES IS IT. MAKES THE EAST SIDE OF THAT BUILDING TO PROTRUDE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN SAY THAT THE LIMITS OF THE OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL. THE CIRCLES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT IT'S GEOMETRY IS VERY COMPACT AND- WELL WE SEE IT FROM- FROM FROM ABOVE AS IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY BIG BUILDING BUT WHEN YOU ARE AT EYE LEVEL. THE GEOMETRY OF THE CIRCLE ALWAYS IS BY GOING AWAY FROM YOU SO YOU NEVER REALLY SEE THE ENTIRE VOLUME OUT OF THE BUILDING BECAUSE ALWAYS PEELING AWAY FROM YOU. SO THAT ALLOWS NATURALLY BY GEOMETRY BE ABLE TO PULL AWAY FROM. FROM THAT FROM THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE IN AND CREATE THE ROOM- FOR THE TREES AS WELL. THE DOUBLE THAT THE SQUARE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT YOU KNOW IT OUTLINES WITH THAT NORTH AND SOUTH FACADE FOR THE OF THE- WEST WING. A. N. YOU KNOW FEMALE MORE PROMINENT- FACADE- YOU KNOW I AM COMPETING A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH THE WEST WING BUT STILL. ABLE TO BE RESOLVED IN A IN A IN A GOOD WAY. FOR THE TREES AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF MORE CHALLENGING TO DEAL WITH THE MILITARY BUT WE THINK- THAT WE CAN. WE CAN STILL PRESENT A TREE. AND THEN ALL THREE OF THE FACADES ALSO REVEALED BACK THE- THE HISTORIC FACADE OF THE SITE OF THE WEST WING. AND THIS IS A VIEW A LITTLE FURTHER EAST- FROM THE SOUTHEAST LOOKING BACK AT THE DOME AND YOU CAN SEE HOW. THAT THE BUILDING THREE FEEDBACK- A BIT ALLOW YOU TO STILL HAVE A VERY GOOD VIEW TO THE DAHLE. AND THAT IS WITH THE TREES SO THE TREES ARE SOLD DANCE AROUND THE SITE THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE VIEWS ARE OBVIOUSLY. FROM PICKING FROM AWAITING THE TREES THE TREES ARE VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE OF THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF THIS PROJECT SO WE MUST THAT BE BE REALLY REALLY. CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DEAL WITH A- THIS IS A VIEW GOING UP- THE- TWELVE STREET FROM ANOTHER THAT. LOOKING OVER. WELL. SOMETHING. RIGHT. THERE IS. SOMEWHERE THE CORRECT. HELLO YEP NOT SMELL MUCH BETTER SO AS I WAS SAYING THIS VIEW IS LOOKING NORTH- I'VE- THAT TOLD THE STREET RIGHT AWAY- ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS THE CIRCLE- IT PROTRUDES A LITTLE BIT OUT INTO THIS RIGHT AT AREA YEAH CREATING A PORCH- AN ENTRYWAY. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE DOUBLE T. IN THE SQUARE WILL NEED TO RELY ON A SMALLER CANOPY OR SMALLER GESTURES TO BE ABLE TO- THE NOTE THAT THAT ENTRY WAY AND THAT'S WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE TREES SO THAT THE BUILDING IS FAIRLY WELL THE SCREEN WITH A LOT OF THE TREE. ANOTHER OF USES- LOOKING. AND WE'VE ALL OF THE SCHEMES HAVE A WHAT WE CALL AN INCISION OR A GESTURE TO BE ABLE TO FRAME- THE VIEW TO THE TO THE DAHLE. AND THEN DENOTE AN IMPORTANT. ONTO ON TO THE NEXT BUILDING. HOWEVER IF WE LOOK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT WHERE WE THIS PERSPECTIVES WERE TAKEN THE TREES ARE SO DENSE THAT YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT. I'M SURE THAT AS YOU WALK THROUGH THE PARK THERE REMAIN INSTANCES THAT YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE TREES AND STILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THEY'LL- AND THEN LASTLY- THE VIEW- LOOKING AT- FROM THE- I GUESS IS THE NORTHEAST. AT THE MOON TREATS YOU CAN SEE IT THERE. HOW THE DOUBLE T. AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE PLANT THERE ON TOP- THE RED THE RED LITTLE CIRCLE THAT IS THE MOON TREE THAT IS THE DREAM THAT. THE COMES THE CLOSEST TO THE STRUCTURE- DOUBLE T. AND THIS IN THE CIRCLE ARE ABLE TO- STAY AWAY FROM THAT TREE AND ABLE TO PRESERVE REQUIRED QUITE A BIT. WE THINK THAT THE SQUARE STOLE- ABLE TO DO THAT B. AS IT AS IT IS IT WILL BE. ALMOST IN THE SAME LOCATION AS THE EXISTING ANNEXES BUT IT WE NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE STUDY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT TREE COULD BE PREPARED. WITH THAT SCHEME. AND THEN HERE'S A VIEW- WITH ALL THE TREES TOGETHER SO- YEAH WE ARE MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO TRY TO PRESERVE THE TREES OF MANY OF THEM. THAT WE CAN. FROM A PERFORMANCE PERSPECTIVE- THIS CAPITAL WILL PROBABLY BE ONE OF A- HIGHEST ENERGY. PERFORMANCE OF ANY CAPITAL IN THE NATION. AND WE ALSO OF FOCUS A LITTLE BIT ON THAT ASPECT OF WELLNESS AND THE TOO TOP ROWS THERE ARE ABOUT THE LIGHT AND GLARE WHICH IS YOU KNOW. MANIFESTA SILVA HOW THE INHABITANTS IN THERE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE DAYLIGHT IN AND BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH CARE THEREFORE AS THE THOUGHT OF THE LOWER- I WROTE THERE IS ABOUT- SOLAR RADIATION. AND I THINK THAT THE CIRCLE PERFORMS A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THE OTHERS. EVEN THOUGH THEY ALL A LOT HAVE A GOOD PERFORMANCE. LASTLY WE HAVE- WORKED THE PROGRAM IN ALL THREE OF THESE CONCEPTS. IN ITS TOTALITY FROM ON ALL THE FLOORS AND WE THINK THAT THEY ARE WORKING WELL AND THEY HAVE A- GOOD FUNCTION FUNCTIONALITY AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SPACE AND WE WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPACES ARE FUNCTIONING FOR THAT. FOR YOU FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS FOR THE EXECUTIVE. BRANCH HERE'S A CIRCLE. FAMOUS LAY OUT. AND THEN THE SQUARE. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'VE WE'VE- FOUND MANY COMMONALITIES AND WE SORT OF GROUP THEM HERE- FOR YOUR READING AND ALL THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE- THE PACKET OR HALF MAY HAVE RECEIVED THE PACKAGE YESTERDAY. AND WE'VE SORT OF A GROUP THEM IN TWO CATEGORIES THE WORK WORKDAY PRODUCTIVITY WELL BEING AND THAT OF A PUBLIC AND USER SUCH AS SAFETY AND ACCESSIBILITY AND THEY ALL WE THINK OUR GREAT IMPROVEMENT- FROM FOR MORE SITTING HERE TODAY ON. THE ALEX. WITHOUT THAT WE BUY ONE FOCUS ON THE MODEL AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT. FOUR THOSE VIEWERS THAT ARE ON THE INTERNET YOU MAY WANT TO FOCUS THE CAMERA ON THE MODEL NOW AND- YEAH IF WE COULD GET THE TELEVISION ON THE MODEL AND WHOEVER'S IN THE ROOM CAN CA. SO WE LIKE TO USE THIS AS A TOOL JUST TO REITERATE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE THREE DIFFERENT SCHEMES. SO YOU CAN SEE YEAH THE DOUBLE T. HOW IT CINCHES IN IN THE MIDDLE READY TO CREATE READING ROOM FOR THE WEST WING. AS WELL AS TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE THE THREE FIVE ON THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH. AND THEN YOU SEE HOW I'M THE REST OF THAT SQUARE FOOTAGE IS PUT IN THE BACK. AGAIN IN A PLACE WITH NO EXISTING TREES. AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW THE RHYTHM OF THE DOUBLE T. THE FACADE RHYTHM READY FAST. YOU LAKE THAT RHYTHM. ON THE WEST WING. AND I'M GOING TO VERY CAREFULLY TAKE THIS ONE OUT. IT WAS. AND THEN WE CAN PUT THE CIRCLE AND. AND I'VE BEEN DOING THAT YOU CAN SEE. WITH THE SEVERAL PM JUST BY VIRTUE OF ITS GEOMETRY. THAT THE GEOMETRY NATURALIST INCHES IN AROUND THE WEST WING. GIVING THE WEST BRING A LOT OF BREATHING ROOM AS WELL AS TENSIONS IN TO THE EAST- AND WE MENTIONED HOW THE CIRCLE RATES THIS PORCH OVER THE TWELFTH STREET RIGHT OF WAY READY CREATING A KIA ENTRANCE INTO THE BUILDING. ANOTHER WE LOOKING AT THE MODEL NOW FROM ABOVE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS A PEDESTRIAN FROM MY LEVEL THE GEOMETRY READY IS ALWAYS RECEDING AWAY FROM YOU SO YOU NEVER QUITE EXPERIENCED. THE FULL THE FULL- THE VOLUME OF THE OF THE SCHEME. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE FUN OUT. YOU HAVE THAT. THEN WILL AND WITH THE SWIFT GAME. THE DEFINITELY THE DRAMA THREE OF THE WAY POSSIBLY GEOMETRY THAT'S MORE RECOGNIZABLE YOU CAN SEE HOW IT ALSO CINCHES BACK A LITTLE LESS THAN THE OTHERS AT THAT THE OTHER SCHEMES SO REVEALING THE EAST FACADE- AND REALLY IS IN TUNE WITH THE GEOMETRY OF THE WEST WING HAS A LOT OF THE SAME FEATURES. I'LL JUST SPEND THAT AROUND. I THINK THAT'S GOOD. REPORTING BY THE- ON PRESENTATION MODE SO WE CAN MOVE ON TO A- THIS THEIR HEARTS- COMMENTS ON BUDGET AND SCHEDULE. I'M GONNA TRY TO ADVANCE THE SLIGHT BEFORE. HOW DO I GET RID OF THE- WELL. TRANSACTION. ALL RIGHT THERE YOU GO. BIGELOW DAVID. FOR A FORGET I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK DONE TO KEEP THINGS- CLEAN I'VE I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND EFFORT I'M SURE HE DIDN'T INTEND TO JUMP UP AND DOWN SO MUCH AS HE HAS BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE HIM TAKING CARE OF THAT I WANT TO TALK FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE AND THE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY THAT WE'RE WE'RE USING FOR THE- ANNEX BUILDING- FIRST OF ALL BEFORE I START AGAIN I WANT TO RE AND- REINFORCED THE FACT THAT THESE ARE CONCEPTUAL DRAWINGS. WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO THEY LOOK WONDERFUL I MEAN THE TECHNOLOGY TODAY OVER YOU KNOW THE OVERTIME AS HE EVOLVED TO WHERE THESE LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FINISHED DRAWINGS BUT I DON'T WANT TO FOOL YOU HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO STILL TRY TO BRING THINGS TO TOGETHER- I WAS ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE USING- IN- MANAGING THE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE IN THE AND THE PROJECT OVERALL. WE'VE DEVELOPED A PROCESS- UTILIZE OVER THE LAST- FOR CAPITAL SO WE VIEWS CALLED EARLY PROJECT DEFINITION AN ALIGNMENT WHICH IS WHAT THE THAT GENERALLY DOES ARE BASICALLY DOES IS IT TRIES TO TAKE THE EXPECTATIONS THAT YOU THE- OWNER HAS AND ALIGN THAT WITH THE BUDGET AND SCHEDULE AND QUALITY THAT. YOU WANT FOR YOUR YOUR BILL IN DOING THE- WELL WE DO IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART THAT IS- DISPLAYED. A BLACK LINE THAT IS RUNNING THROUGH THERE IS THE TRADITIONAL. SHOW THAT ON THE SCREEN. OOPS YEAH SUCH SHOWING UP SO THE BLACK LINE THAT YOU SEE ON THE IN THE GRAPH THERE ON THE RIGHT IS THE TRADITIONAL DESIGN PROCESS AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS WE TRY TO MOVE THAT TO THE LEFT WHICH IS WHERE THE RED LINE IS SHOWING AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT PLACES IT UNDER THE BLUE CURVE AND- THAT BLUE CURVE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE OF THE PROJECT AND EARLY IN THE PROJECT THE MORE WE CAN DO EARLY ON THE LESTICUS COSTS US WITH THE MORE INFLUENCE WE HAVE BECAUSE LESS DECISIOS HAVE BEEN MADE. SO THE MORE THINGS WE CAN DO UP FRONT THE MORE WORK WE CAN PUT INTO IT UP FRONT THE MORE WE CAN IMPACT THE COST THE QUALITY IN THE SCHEDULE IN A POSITIVE WAY IF WE WAIT AND ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE AND WE ALLOW FOR THOSE DECISIONS TO BE MADE AFTER THOSE TWO LINES THE RED IN THE BLUE LINE HAVE INTERSECTED THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT COST OF THE CHANGE BECOMES MUCH HIGHER AND YOU START TO SEE CHANGE ORDERS AND YOU START TO SEE PROBLEMS. FOR THE LAST FOUR CAPITALS UTAH- IDAHO MINNESOTA AND WYOMING WE HAVE USED THIS PROCESS FOR MEMBERS OF OUR TEAM REVIEWS THIS PROCESS TO HELP DELIVER THOSE PROJECTS ON BUDGET AND THAT IS THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE USING TO HELP MANAGE YOUR PROJECT AND SO TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF- OUR MANAGEMENT STRATEGY- MR COOLEY- THE- CHAIRMAN COOLEY HAD- HAD YOU PUT TOGETHER A PLANNING STUDY WHICH WAS PERFECT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WHICH- IS THE BLUE BOOK SHOWN HERE- THAT IDENTIFIED THE DEFICIENCIES THAT THE CURRENT ANNEX HAS. IDENTIFIED THAT MATT WAS- THAT DRAFT WAS COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THAT WAS A VERY HELPFUL DRAFT BECAUSE IT ALLOWED US TO START UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE WITH THE BUILDING SO WE COULD EVALUATE THOSE AND MAKE THE DECISION AS TO HOW TO MOVE. MOVE FORWARD. YOU RECEIVED BACK IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE POS THE PROJECT OVERVIEW IN SEQUENCE REPORT. THAT WE PUT TOGETHER WHICH BASICALLY IDENTIFIED THE QUALITY COST SCHEDULE. AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND IDENTIFIED HOW WE WOULD DO THAT IN A PUT TOGETHER CLEAR PRINCIPLES AND- GUIDELINES TO HELP. THE ARCHITECTS AND THE ENGINEERS AND THE CONTRACTORS MOVE THOSE THINGS FORWARD. AND THAT DRAFT AS I MENTIONED WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE HAVE OVER THE LAST- I WOULD SAY FOUR MONTHS FIVE MONTHS DURING THE SCOLDED PERIOD WE HAVE HELD EIGHT DIFFERENT WORKSHOPS- WITH THE DESIGN TEAM AND PRIOR TO THAT WE HELD FOR FIVE DIFFERENT WORKSHOPS WITH THE- VISITOR CENTER TEAM- WE HAVE ONE WORKSHOP LEFT TO DO WHICH IS A COST RECONCILIATION WORKSHOP FOR THE ONYX WHICH- WE CAN'T REALLY DO UNTIL WE GET DOWN TO ONE SCHEME BECAUSE IT TENDS TO BE A LOT OF EFFORT A LOT OF WORK THAT HAS TO GO INTO THAT. THAT RETIREES RESULT AND SELL THOSE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH- THOSE WORKSHOPS. AND THEN WITH REGARDS TO MANAGING THE BUDGET- WE USE CONTINGENCY IN THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT TO HELP MANAGE THE RISK THAT WE KNOW IS THERE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING AT THIS POINT. AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IN CONCEPT DESIGN WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE WE TRY TO HAVE A LOT OF CONTINGENCY. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY CARRYING ABOUT 20% OF THE BUDGET OR ONE FIFTH OF THE BUDGET TO ONE QUARTER OF THE BUDGET IS IN CONTINGENCY RIGHT NOW. UP FOR EXAMPLE ON SOME OF THESE GAMES THERE'S A LITTLE MORE CONTINGENCY BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE LESS KNOWN- AND THERE'S- ON OTHERS A LITTLE LESS BUT IT'S ALL BETWEEN TWENTY AND 24% SCHEMATIC DESIGN WHICH IS WHERE WE WANT TO GO NEXT WITH ONE SCHEME. WE WILL WORK TO BRING THAT CONTINGENCY DOWN TO ABOUT 15% AND THEN IN DESIGN DEVELOPMENT. WHICH IS WHERE WE REALLY GET INTO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF HOW THE BUILDING GOES TOGETHER AND HOW THINGS. ARE LEARNED. WE WILL MAIN WE'LL GET DOWN TO ABOUT THAT. WE ARE ABLE TO ELIMINATE SOME AND MOVE SOME IN TO THE DESIGN THEREBY HELPING TO REDUCE THE OVERALL BUDGET- AND WE INTEND THEM TO SIGN THE GMP AND GO INTO CONSTRUCTION WITH ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN. PERCENT CONTINGENCY. SO WHERE ARE WE CURRENTLY WITH THE ESTIMATE. IF YOU TAKE ANY ONE OF THESE. SCHEMES WE ARE BETWEEN ABOUT FIVE AND 10% IN THE AGGREGATE- THE ON THE BUDGET BEYOND THE POS BUDGET. WHICH IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE STATE BECAUSE AGAIN REMEMBER THIS A LOT WE STILL DON'T KNOW AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DISCOVER. THE CONTINGENCY THAT WE'RE CARRYING IS BETWEEN TWENTY AND 24% SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY. AND CONTINGENCY OVER THE OVER THE- OVERREACH THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WE ARE FAIRLY WE ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THAT AND GET THE PROJECT DOWN TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. AND AGAIN WE ARE USING THAT CONTINGENCY AND WE'VE USED IN THE PAST TO MATCH. THE SO THAT WE ACTUALLY PUT MORE IN AT THIS STAGE BECAUSE THERE'S LESS THAT WE UNDERSTAND. SO IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT CONTINGENCY WILL BE ABSORBED INTO THE PROJECT OR ELIMINATED ALL TOGETHER. AND WHEN WE GO INTO CONSTRUCTION WILL BE DOWN TO ABOUT 5% WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW. IS TO TURN THE TIME OVER TO TELL YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SCHEDULE AND THE MILESTONES. THEN I'LL COME BACK IN AND WRAP. GOOD AFTERNOON ALL HERE WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR LOOK AHEAD SPANNING THE DURATION OF THE VISITOR CENTER WEST WING AND ANNEXED PROJECTS- I WILL GO INTO FURTHER DETAIL OF ALL THE MILESTONES ON THE NEXT SLIDE HOWEVER IT IS OF NOTE THAT THE VISITOR CENTER AND THE NEW ANNEXED PROJECTS WILL BE PHASED DESIGN PROJECTS MEANING THAT- DO YOU DESIGN AND PERMITTING ACTIVITIES WILL OVERLAP BE CONSTRUCTION WORK EARLY START OF THE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. CURRENTLY THE SEEK WHAT YOUR MEDICATIONS ARE BEING DRAFTED AND FINALIZED. WHICH WILL THEN PROVIDE TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND TO PRESERVATION STRATEGIES PROJECT WIDE. THIS WILL IMPACT THE CONSTRUCTION STARTS AT THE VISITOR CENTER AND THE NEW ANNEX CONSTRUCTION. DESIGN AND PERMITTING FOR ENABLING PRE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES IS ALSO UNDER WAY WITHIN THE WEST WING AND ANNEXED AREAS WHICH IS SHOWN IN BLUE IN THIS GRAPHIC. THIS PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK IS SET TO START IN MARCH OF NEXT YEAR. AND AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE GRANT REFUND HE FROM TURNER THE- CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AT RISK TEAM TO SPEAK ON. TURNER'S CLASS ACTIVITIES. GOOD AFTERNOON HI I'M THE DALLAS ACTUALLY STARTS WITH A SERIES OF SMALLER PROJECTS POKE THAT WERE CALLING A NAVAL AND WORK THEIR WAY MORE CONSISTS OF RELOCATING EXISTING UTILITIES MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL SITE UTILITIES FROM THE EXISTING ANNEX INTO THE WEST WING. THAT WORK WILL ALLOW THE WORST WARNED TO REMAIN FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL WHILE WE TEAR DOWN AND. REPLACE ANNEX WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION. THE ENABLING WORK ALSO CONSISTS OF INSTALLING TEMPORARY PER. AND EXIT STERRETT. ON THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE WEST WING NOT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE WEST WING AND DO BUSINESS WALL THE ANNEX IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. THE I. ANNEX CONSTRUCTION ARE IS DEPENDENT ON THE DESIGN AND PERMITTING THE CURRENT WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON THE SELECTION OF ONE OF THE THREE OPTIONS. THAT JOSE AND CHLOE EXPLAINED TODAY. I WE'VE PLAN FOR ABOUT THIRTY THREE MONTHS OF DESIGN AND PERMITTING. I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME BUT FOR A PROJECT OF THIS MAGNITUDE IS VERY AGGRESSIVE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE THAT DECISION. AT THE 50% CD FRASER CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENT PHASE OF THE DESIGN WILL PUT TOGETHER THE GUARANTEED MAXIMUM PRICE. WHICH WILL ALLOW THE FUNDING TO BE- FINALIZE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. WE'VE ALSO PLAN FOR THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS OF CONSTRUCTION ON THE INTERNET THE NEW ANNEX. LONG COMPLETION OF THE GMP APPROVAL THE GMP. AND THE COMPLETION OF THE ENABLING WORK WILL BE ABLE TO GET STARTED WITH THE DEMOLITION. OF THE EXISTING ADDICTS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR CONSTRUCTION THIRTY EIGHT MONTHS THAT MEANS E COMPLETE IN APRIL TO JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WHICH ALLOWS FOR FOUR MONTHS OF. A STAFFING AND STOCKING THE NEW ANNEX COMMISSION AND THAT. ALLOWS FOR OCCUPANCY. AND NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JACK GARRITY WITH PLANT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WORKING WITH THE CAVAGNOUD TEAM AND JUST WANTED TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SCHEDULE HERE FOR THE VISITOR CENTER- WITH YOUR APPROVAL. WE WOULD. BEGIN DESIGN AND PERMITTING WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD BEGIN CONSTRUCTION IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR CONSTRUCTION WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR SO. AND WE WOULD BE FINISHED BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO WITH PHASE ONE. PHASE TWO- IF IT'S FUNDED WITHIN PROCEED AT- IDEALLY DOVETAIL WITH THE PHASE ONE BUT COULD HAPPEN ANYTIME. AN OCCUPANCY. WOULD BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE. THANK YOU. NOW TO SUPPLEMENT THE OPPOSITE R. CENTER THE EARLY START OF THE VISITOR CENTER OR THE START OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VISITOR CENTER IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE FINISHING OF THE VISITOR CENTER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE WOULD ALLOW FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS OF- ENTRY EXIT ACCESS THROUGH THE VISITORS CENTER TORE TO EXCUSE ME BE CAPITOL BUILDING WHILE B. ALEX IS BEING CONSTRUCTED FOR DEMOLISHED AND CONSTRUCTED ITSELF. NOW MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE HAVE MILES THE MILESTONES LEADING UP TO THE OCCUPANT MOVE OF THE DETECTED NO SWING SPACE AND ABATEMENT AND DEMOLITION OF THE EXISTING ANNEX. AS DAVID HAD MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION OR SEGMENT- WORKSHOP NUMBER NINE COST RECONCILIATION WILL BE. SCHEDULED MID OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND ARTIST PENDANT UPON PENDING UPON THE FINAL SELECTION OF THE DESIGN OF THE ANNEX. FOLLOWING THAT IN IT MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE VISITOR CENTER WOULD START IF APPROVED AND- ONE BTC QUIET EFFORTS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED. THEY MOVED TO THE SWING SPACE WILL TAKE PLACE MID OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE G. M. P. IN MARCH FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND FINALLY THE ABATEMENT DEMOLITION CONSTRUCTION START OF THE- NEW ANNEX BUILDING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AROUND MARCH. DEGREE CRITICS SCHEDULING SEGMENT OF THE PRESENTATION THE CURRENT ENABLING WORK- PRECEDES THE START OF THE OCCUPANT MOVED TO THE SWING SPACE. WITH YOUR APPROVAL THE VISITOR CENTER WOULD START MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALLOWING FOR UP ANOTHER ENTRY OPPORTUNITY AN EXITING OPPORTUNITY TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING. AND OCCUPANCY WILL BE TAKING PLACE IN THE ALEX IN LATE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. NOW WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO REINTRODUCE DAVID HART. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO IS PRESENTED TODAY- YOU CAN SEE THAT WE'VE SET A VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE TO TRY TO OPEN- IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ON SEPTEMBER NINTH WHICH IS- YOUR ADMISSIONS DAIS WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CELEBRATION ON THAT DAY- WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU. DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM TODAY BUT NONE THE LESS WE ARE AND YOU TO CONSIDER THE- THE DOUBLE T. THE CIRCLE IN THE SQUARE WE NEED YOUR DIRECTION BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH SO THAT WE CAN STAY ON SCHEDULE AND KEEP THINGS MOVING FORWARD. WE WOULD ALSO LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THE VISITOR CENTER AND GIVE US SOME DIRECTION AS TO HOW YOU WOULD LIKE US TO PROCEED ON THAT. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN THE TIME BACK OVER TO- CHAIRMAN COOLEY AND WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. FOR THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION FOR WALKING US THROUGH THIS PROGRAM AND- TODAY IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING TO THE DRUG RULES COMMITTEE THIS INFORMATION. IT HAS NOT BEEN IN THE PUBLIC REALM BECAUSE THE HASN'T YET COME TO THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE SEOUL AND WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM AS SUCH STILL THIS IS A CONVENIENT. AND I AM I AM INFORMED THAT THERE IS SOME MAYBE SOME BAND WITH ISSUES BEING EXPRESSED ONLINE BUT ALL THE MATERIAL THE YOU'VE JUST SEN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ONLINE IT'S NOW IN THE PUBLIC REALM AND SO. TODAY PROVIDES A VERY IMPORTANT MILESTONE FROM THAT STANDPOINT- I'D LIKE TO START AT THIS POINT WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND I KNOW I HAVE SOME MEMBERS THAT ARE ONLINE I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN MOVE THEM UP. WHO WOULD- MR GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I MAY- TO THE PRESENTERS. OUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS OF GOING BACK TO CONTINGENCY AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT- THE 20% CONTINGENCY THAT IS- I BELIEVE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET- FOR THE ANNEX. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO GET THAT CONTINGENCY DOWN TO ABOUT DECREASE IN THE CONTINGENCY. DOES THE AND RIGHT NOW IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU'RE ABOUT FIVE OR 10% ABOVE THE BUDGET AS FAR AS WHERE WE'RE AT- WHICH MEANS THAT- THE MORE- THE QICKER WE MOVE TO. A CHOSEN PLAN AND THE MORE WE ELIMINATE THAT CONSENT OR DECREASE THE CONTINGENCY- YOU'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT BEING ABLE TO BRING A PROJECT DESIGNED. AND THAT MAY BE- ATTY OR MAYBE JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER BUDGET IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH THIS IS MISTER HART JERRY IT'S HOW HE HAS MANAGED PROJECTS THIS ACTION VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. SO I'LL LET HIM SPEAK TO THAT YES THANK YOU- YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT WE USE CONTINGENCY TO HELP OFFSET THE RISK OF THE UNKNOWNS THAT WE HAVE AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THOSE- ITEMS. THAT CONTINGENCY WILL EITHER BE ELIMINATED- BECAUSE WE WILL KNOW AND WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. BUT IN SOME CASES IT ALSO BE INCORPORATED SORE OUR GOAL IS TO KIND OF WORK BOTH WAYS TOWARDS THE BUDGET SO THAT WHEN WE ARE COMPLETE AND WE SIGNED THE GMP THAT WE ARE ON BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO THE CHAIR ONE MORE QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THE CIRCULAR DESIGN IT- IT APPEARS TO BE CLEAR THAT THE BOTTOM TWO LEVELS. ARE UN INTERRUPTED FOR SPACE ALL THE WAY AROUND. BUT THE TOP LEVELS ABOVE THE BOTTOM TWO LEVELS. IT APPEARS LIKE- IT BECOMES TWO SEPARATE ALMOST TWO SEPARATE BUILDINGS ARE EACH OF THOSE FOUR LEVELS CONNECTED BY. A WALKWAY WORSE SOMETHING OF THAT SORT. I WAS. JOSE DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU CAN YOU CAN PROBABLY DO IT FROM THERE. THIS IS MICRO M. I'M NOT SURE I A- TIMELY AND- DAY HEARD YOUR QUESTION BUT- IT ALSO LONG TERM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SPACE INSIDE YES- IF I'M WALKING AROUND THE PERIMETER INSIDE INSIDE. THIS PART RIGHT HERE THESE TWO SECTIONS RIGHT HERE YEAH ARE THERE WALKWAYS BETWEEN THE WHERE THERE'S NO ACTUAL- OFFICE SPACE. THERE SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GO ALL THE WAY AROUND OKAY ALL THE WAY AROUND FOR SURE YES YEAH WELL THAT THAT MAKES ME LIKE THAT DESIGN EVEN MORE THAN I ALREADY LOVE IT- SO- MISTER CHAIR IT'S JUST- FOR MY OPINION FIRST OF ALL WHEN IT COMES THE VISITORS CENTER- I REALLY LIKE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE- ALONG WITH- THE DESIGN TEAM. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE PRIORITIZE THE PEOPLE FIRST. AND THAT WE WORK ON THE VISITOR CENTER WE GIVE% ACCESS AND I AM FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THE VISITORS CENTER AND AS WELL WOULD LIKE TO JUST PUT MY OPINION ABOUT THE CIRCULAR HOW THAT- I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT DESIGN AND WHAT IT DOES FOR. THE CAPITAL PARKING. PROJECT AND FOR THE PEOPLE AS WELL. I WANT TO SAY I. JUST IN RESPONSE OF THAT. WHERE I FEEL WE ARE AT THE VISITOR CENTER IS. IF WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHICH DESIGN. THAT IS WHAT THE CREW DAYS FOR THE END OF PROJECT AND SHE- AS- YOU GO BACK TO MARCH. THINK OF THOSE HEADLINES ECONOMY WAS COLLAPSING. JOBS ARE BEING LOST. FALL IN A WAY THE SURPLUS IS A WEIRD AMASSED IN JEOPARDY YOU JUST THAT TIME OF YEAR. AND THE GOVERNOR SAID LET'S KEEP A CHECK ON OUR SPENDING. THIS IS HIS JOB AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SO FOR THIS REASON THE VISITOR CENTER WHICH WHILE IT PLAYS AT INTEGRAL ROLE IN THE STRATEGY TO GET RID OF BOTTLENECKS AND CONGESTION. OF AND OVERCROWDING. IS SORT OF A PLUS ELEMENT. TO THE LARGER ENERGY PROJECTS OF ASHLEY PUT ON PAUSE SO I JUST WANNA SAY I ACTUALLY FAVOR THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S A- IF. IT'S UNDER THE LAW. THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE IS TO HAVE THE PREEMINENT ROLE IN DECISIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT THAT'S ACTUALLY WORE TO DISTRACTION PREEMINENT. THAT BEING THE CASE IT DOES SAY ANNEX PARKING GARAGE RESERVE CENTER. BUT IT SAYS TIMING COULD VERY SO I SORT OF FEEL IF IT IS THE VIEW OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE AS WE FINALLY CONVENE WITH A QUORUM. AND HAVE A SETTLED VIEW. DID WITH SERVICE CENTER I BELIEVE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ENGAGE WITH THE GOVERNOR CONVERSATION. BECAUSE OF WE ARE PARTNERS WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THE PROJECT WILL GREATLY ENHANCE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SPACES BUT I FEEL ALL. IT'S I AM PROTECTIVE OF OUR PROVOCATIVE IS A JOINT RULES COMMITTEE TO GIVE LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. BUT WE HAVE TO RESPECT ALL OUR PARTNERS SO I THINK IT'S EASIER TO SEE HOW WE ARE WE KNOW A CLEARPATH ON THE ANNEX PROJECT PROBLEM PARKING GARAGE. I PERSONALLY FEEL THERE IS IN MY HEAD AN ASTERISK AROUND THE VISITOR CENTER. OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR. AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO I WILL GET YOU IN A MOMENT. CENTER MONNING YOU'D RAISE YOUR HAND. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND JUST RE FRAMING MAYBE WHAT YOU WERE ARTICULATING. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE MAY REVISE INCLUDED GREEN LINE FUNDING FOR THE ANNEX BUT NOT FOR THE VISITOR CENTER SO. BEFORE US CURRENTLY TODAY OR WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM. WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMMIT FUNDING. TO THE VISITOR CENTER THAT SAID IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT FOR ONGOING DELIBERATION AND ISSUE SUGGESTED DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THE URGENCY THE NINE HEARING FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH DESIGNING INSISTING ON TIME TABLE ON THE ANNEX PROJECT IS WHERE A DECISION IS NECESSARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT AS SOON AS WE CAN CONVENE A QUORUM OF THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD BE THE VOTE TO ALLOW PROJECT PLANNING TO MOVE FORWARD- WITH AN ON. THE DESIGN I GUESS DEVELOP FOR THE ANNEX IS DEPENDENT ON WHETHER THERE'S A VISITOR CENTER OR NOT SO THERE'S STILL A DYNAMIC. BETWEEN THE TWO- AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF GOOD ARGUMENTS FROM SECURITY POINT OF VIEW ACCESS. IN THE USE OF SPACE IN THE ANNEX THAT THERE BE SOME COMMITMENT TO THE VISITORS CENTER BUT- AGAIN MY QUESTION- MY STATEMENT IS I DON'T THINK THAT'S WITHIN OUR AUTHORITY TODAY OR IN COMING WEEKS BUT TO MOVE TO GET EVERYTHING MOVING FORWARD WE WILL FRAME A VOTE ON A CHOICE AMONG THE THREE ANNEX OPTIONS- IN CONTINUE TO DISCUSS HOW. THAT DEVELOPMENT IS IMPACTED WITH OR WITHOUT A VISITORS CENTER IN MY STATING THAT I FRANKLY REALLY CORRECT WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATION ACTUALLY OF THE- FUNDS FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT. THE APPROPRIATIONS OR PASSED IN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN FUNDED THE ENTIRE PROJECT. IN THE DOWNTURN THE REQUEST WAS CAN A EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CASH. WHICH I SAID YES. CAN WE PUT THE VISCERAL PAUSE THAT SEEMED REASONABLE AGAIN THIS IS THE MIDDLE OF MARCH AND I'M ON THE FOR THE GOVERNORS FINANCE DIRECTOR- BUT THE CONVERSATION AS WELL. WE DO HAVE PLANNING DESIGN WORK IN A WAY WE CAN OF COURSE CONTINUE THAT. BECAUSE IT'S AN ELEMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S STATE FOR A STORY- NINETY ONE TWELVE. ANNEX PARKING GARAGES OR CENTER. AND THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PLANNING CONTINUING. SO I DO FEEL AS A PRACTICAL MATTER WE JUST. WE DO NEED TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGREEMENT TO FUND THE VISITOR CENTER THAT IT'S- CLAIRE WE ALREADY HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER STATUTE ENACTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT. WE CAN USE LEASE REVENUE BONDS FOR THE PROJECT. AND AT THE FORTY IS ALSO IN PLACE SO WE SUPPORTED OUR STATE IN RESPONDING TO A STATE OF EMERGENCY WE HAVE THESE REVENUE BONTA FORTY AVAILABLE THAT'S ALSO WHEN THE MAYES. BUDGET REVISE NO- BUT I YEAH I MEAN I FEEL IT'S- BY LAW JOINT RULES HAS THE STATE FOR A FORTY ITS HOW WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THE ANNEX THE WEST WING WAS A LEGISLATIVE PROJECT. THE LAW REFLECTS THAT I THINK IT'S FAIR FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY. TO CONSIDER WHERE THEY FEEL WE OUGHT TO BE GOING AND IF WE FAVOR MOVING FORWARD AS AGGRESSIVE AS YOU CAN WITH THE VISITOR CENTER AND IT IS A CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR ALONG THOSE LINES I THINK SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HELPFUL FROM THE MANAGEMENT TEAM. MIGHT BE. SOME COST PROJECTIONS OF. DOING VISITORS CENTER THIS. ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSED SCHEDULE VERSUS A DELAY IN POTENTIAL COST INCREASES THAT MIGHT. FURTHER INFORMED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THEN IF I COULD MOVE TO A QUICK QUESTION MISTER CHAIR JUST ON THE THREE DESIGN CHOICES ON THE ANNEX- ON THE CIRCLE DESIGN- IN TERMS OF CONFIGURATION OF OFFICE SPACE- ARE THERE ANY ISSUES. OF THE RAM ONE FOR FURNITURE AND- ARE THE COSTS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT OF THE THREE OPTIONS AND- DO ANY OF THE OPTIONS HAVE UNIQUE. SPATIAL COST ISSUES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF SENATOR MONNING. THEY ALL HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT- COST IMPLICATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE DOUBLE T. HAS A VERY LARGE ATRIUM SO WE'RE PAYING FOR THAT ATRIUM THE VENTILATION AND THE SMOKE EVACUATION SYSTEM IN THE ROUND SCHEME- IT IS ONLY A TWO STORY SPACE SO IT'S TECHNICALLY NOT AN ATRIUM THEREFORE NO WE'RE NOT PAYING FOR AN ATRIUM EVACUATION SITUATION. HOWEVER THE ROUND SCHEME DOES POSE CERTAIN- COMPLEXITIES WITH REGARDS TO CONNECTIONS AND- WITH REGARDS TO HOW YOU TAKE FLAT MATERIALS AND ENDITEM AND TO CURB MATERIAL SO YOU YOU YOU'RE ASKING AN EXCELLENT QUESTION WE ARE ACTUALLY CARRYING ABOUT TWENTY FOUR POINT 5% CONTINGENCY ON THE ROUND SCHEMES OR CARRYING MORE CONTINGENCY THERE. BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ON THE- AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE THINGS AS WE TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO THAT CONTINGENCY IN AS WE LEARN MORE WE'LL- MOVE THAT HOPEFULLY NUMBER DOWN THANK YOU IN. FOR A YIELD BACK TO THE CHAIR JUST A FINAL COMMENT ON THE THREE DESIGNS. THE IS IT THE DOUBLE T. THAT HAS THE FORCE. FOR FLOOR ATRIUM. SO JUST A THOUGHT FROM A CONCERT THE SECURITY POINT OF VIEW. THE PUBLIC AREA AS IT FILLS UP IF THERE ARE. PROTEST DEMONSTRATIONS PEOPLE EXERCISING PEACEFUL FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS THERE COULD BE A PREFERENCE TO HAVING UPPER FLOORS SEALED OFF FROM THAT PARTICIPATORY- SHOULD GAUGE MEANT IF YOU WILL- SO I THINK PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THERE IT'S- RIGHT SPACES OPEN FOR TWO FLOORS VERSUS FOR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES- SO THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR GOOD- I'M GONNA GO TO WINDY. AND I'M GONNA GO TO YOU CENTER MORLOCK IS MY FINANCE EXPERT MADAM. KAMLAGER HIS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THE INCREDIBLE PRESENTATION TODAY SENATOR MONNING HAD TOUCHED UPON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I WANT TO RAISE AS WELL- I BELIEVE IT'S MEXICO CITY'S CONGRESS THAT'S DESIGNED IN THE CIRCULAR WAY. OUT WHEN I WENT TO GO VISIT IT JUST FELT LIKE IT TOOK A REALLY LONG TIME TO GET TO THE OFFICE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING THE WALKABILITY OF EACH DESIGN AND WHICH WHICH DESIGN I PREFER MY PREFERENCES THAT THE CIRCULAR ONE- PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT HELPS SAVE THE MOST TREES. WHICH IS I THINK A AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BEAUTIFUL SPACE- AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS IF THERE'S ANY DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE WALKABILITY- AS YOU KNOW STAFF RUNS AROUND AND- AND WE ALL DO RUNNING FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE TRYING TO DO OUR OUR JOBS ON A DAILY BASIS AND JUST WHAT THE SIGNS ARE. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE WE HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH AND HAVE THE ARCHITECTS FIGURE OUT THE AMOUNT OF LINEAL DISTANCE ON ANY OF THE SCHEMES YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOT YET SO I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER SPECIFICALLY BUT WE HAVE CREATED A SERIES OF- CROSS CORRIDOR IF YOU LOOK AT THE DESIGN AS WELL SO YOU HAVE THE CIRCULAR 8EME ABILITY TO WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND THE BUILDING. BUT WITHIN THAT CIRCULATION WE HAVE CIRCULATION AND IS HAPPENING ON TWO SIDES SO YOU CAN CROSS THROUGH AND GO BACK. SO IF YOU WANT TO WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND THE PERIMETER OR THE INTERIOR IT PROBABLY ISN'T- UP MAYBE A LITTLE MORE BECAUSE OF THE CIRCULAR NATURE THAN MAYBE THE DOUBLE T. BUTTON THE DOUBLE T. ALSO HAS A CIRCULATION OF GOES DOWN EITHER SIDE AND THEN HAS WINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK UP INTO. AND SO LIKE MY GUESS IS THE CIRCULATION IS PROBABLY- RELATIVELY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER EVEN THOUGH IT'S A LITTLE MORE- HIDDEN IN IN THE DOUBLE T. THE OTHER THING THAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE GAVE TO THE ARCHITECTS. IS THIS CONCEPT OF ADJACENCY TO EVERYTHING TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET FROM POINT A TO POINT B. QUICKLY AND SO THAT'S WHY A LOT OF THESE CROSS CONNECTIONS OCCUR WITHIN THE WHAT WHAT WE TO THE SIR OF THE FIGURE A- SO THAT IF YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCLE AND YOU NEED TO GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER YOU HAVE THAT ABILITY TO MOVE OR IF YOU NEED TO GO ACROSS TO DOUBLE CROSSED WITHOUT HAVING TO WALK AROUND. SO WE TRY TO MAKE IT AS CONVENIENT AS POSSIBLE BUT I DO THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME INHERENT ADDITIONAL. CIRCULATION IN THE CIRCLE. I WANTED IF I MAY SO WOMAN. WAY BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS STUDY WAS DONE FOR US WHERE IS JUST VERY COLORFUL CHART. AND THE UPSHOT OF THIS CHART IS THAT WHAT IS QUITE UNIQUE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL IS THIS IDEA WE HEARD REFERRED TO THE ADJACENCY OF EVERYTHING. A MEMBER CAN ARRIVE IN THE BASEMENT RIDE THE ELEVATOR GET TO YOUR OFFICE. FROM THE OFFICE OF AND AFTER HEARING ROOM. THEN GO TO ANOTHER ROOM THEN GO CHECK OF READERSHIP GO SEE LET'S SAY COUNCIL GET TO THE CAUCUS ROOM. THERE IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO GET ALL AROUND THE BILL INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES THAT MAKE UP YOUR DAY. AND ALSO AS A LAWMAKER. OUR JOB IS SORT OF MAKE OUR DAY PRODUCTIVE. SO I WANT TO POINT THIS OU BECAUSE THIS WHOLE PROJECT FROM DAY ONE. HAS LOOKED AT THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT LOSING THIS QUALITY OF OUR CAPITAL. OF EVERYTHING WITHIN EASY REACH. SO THE WHATEVER THE DEMANDS OF AN INDIVIDUAL LAWMAKER NOW IN THE FUTURE THEY CAN GET A LOT DONE WITH THEIR AVAILABLE TIME. SO I WANT TO SAY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION NOT TO DISMISS BUT TO SAY KEEP THINKING ABOUT THAT. ALL THESE QUARTERS RESIGNED TO PROVIDE CENTRAL CORRIDORS MULTIPLE WAYS TO GET AROUND SO YOU AVOID CONGESTION- BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY. YOU'VE HIT UPON WHAT WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE. IS ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA'S CAP ON UNIQUE. MANY OTHER CAPITALS IT'S MUCH MORE SPRAWLING OF THE WHOLE DC EXPERIENCE- BUT MANY OTHER CAPITAL SEPARATE THING. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY AND I KNOW CENTER HERTZBERG WILL JOIN US. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO JUST POINT OUT THAT. ALSO GOING BACK TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IT CONCERNS EXISTED FROM IN THIS BOOK. ON. GIVEN THE LONG HISTORY SECONDS A PLACE OF HUMAN HABITATION. THERE IS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY OF. CULTURAL RESOURCE OR ARTIFACTS MAY BE PRESENT ON THE GROUNDS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON MAKING SURE WE ARE CAREFUL WITH THE FACT TO TRIBAL ROLEX OR OTHER EVIDENCES ANYWAY THIS POINT WE'VE HAD FORENSIC DOGS CONDUCTED SURVEYS OF THE GROUNDS. LOOKING FOR POSSIBLE ISSUES WE'VE DONE GROUND PENETRATING RADAR TO HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BELOW GRADE WITH THIS IN MIND- I SAY THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE IS. IT IS IT IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT SENSITIVITY AND I PERSONALLY HAVE FELT I NEED A WORKER BY JOINT RULES COMMITTEE BEFORE I'M- DOING TOO MUCH WITH OTHER PARTIES SAID NEEDED. MAKE SURE JOINT RULES IS UP TO SPEED- BUT THIS HAS BEEN A CONCERN FROM DAY ONE AS IT WAS SAID THE DRAFT OF THIS WAS COMPLETED SEVENTEEN. PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER OF SEVENTEEN AND HAS BEEN A PARAMOUNT CONCERN FROM THE BEGINNING- SO OF. YOUR COURSE WAS ADDRESS. SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MATT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU'VE APPARENTLY BEEN HAVING A DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THIS WHOLE PROJECT SO I KIND OF WANT TO. TALK ABOUT THAT OR TALK ABOUT THE TIMING THE TREES AND THE TYPE REAL QUICK I'M IN A DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CYCLE IT IT IS IT IS A IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE- CONSTITUENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE- BUILDING SOMETHING WHEN. EMPLOYEES ARE TAKING FURLOUGHS AND YOU'RE MAKING CAT. SO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND HOW DO WE- INFORM THE CONSTITUENTS THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE'RE DOING. AT A TIME OF SCARCITY BUT WE HAVE ALREADY SAID BONDS ASIDE TO DO THIS. AND THAT IT ACTUALLY WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO WORK AND- IN A GREAT ECONOMIC VITALITY- WE BUILT TERMINAL C. AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT ORANGE COUNTY DURING THE GREAT RECSSION. AND WHEN I WOULD TOURED EVERY SIX WEEKS. THE WORKERS RED BANK ME THAT THEY WERE WORKING THEY HAD A JOB FOR ENTERING WORKING SIDE. I NEED YOU TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND. HOW I CAN COMMUNICATE THIS AND THAT WHAT'S THE GOVERNOR THINKING AND IF THE GOVERNOR PUTS A HOLD ON EVERYTHING THEN. THIS IS ALL ACADEMIC. AND DINNER SO IN THAT REGARD I WOULD ALSO. GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF IDEAS ONE IS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THE VISITOR CENTER AT THE SAME TIME. TWO S. THE TYPE CIRCLE SQUARED A DOUBLE T. EITHER ONE WORKS FOR ME SO I DON'T HAVE LIKE A STRONG BIAS. BUT WOULD YOU LEAST BEFORE WE HEAR SPEAKERS COULD YOU PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR PERSPECTIVES AS WELL ON THE TREES AND THE CONCERN THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING. ABOUT THE PARK. YEAH. ON THE- ON THE TREES FROM A E. I. R. STANDPOINT YOU END UP PUTTING A LARGE. MARK ON THE GROUND WHERE THE PROJECT WILL BE SITUATED. OF FROM DAY ONE. WE HAVE FOCUSED ON HOW TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON THE TREES LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE FOOT PRINT SERVER EXAMPLE THE VISITOR CENTERS TO THE DEODAR CEDARS ARE OUT FOR THE VISITOR CENTER. WE'RE NOT EXPECTED TO TOUCH THOSE TO BYRON SHIRE TREATED MARKETEER TREE OF THE SELF INTEREST OF WHOLE LINE OF NOT GOING TO TOUCH THOSE OR THAT SOUTH LAWN. THE PARKING GARAGE WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE TO PLACE IT. WAS A CONVERSATION SELF ON NORTH LAWN. ORDER TWELVE STREET ALIGNMENT. IT'S NOT A REAL PROBLEM BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE PARKING GARAGE YOU'LL SEE A NOTCH. ON THE EAST SIDE ADJACENT TO THE TULIP TREE. WE HAVE A GRAND TOTAL OF THREE OUT THERE THE LAWN. NEAR THE FISH POND WHICH IS THE NOTCHES DESIGNED TO SAFEGUARD THAT TREE. SO THE. THE PLAN OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PARK TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. AND I PERSONALLY FEEL A CONSIDERATION IS THE AESTHETIC OF THE- HOW THE BUILDING LOOKS INSIDE THE PARK I SORT OF LIKE A CIRCLE BUT I TOO AM OPEN TO WHATEVER DESIGN PEOPLE WANT TO GO WITH. BUT I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT'S SORT OF RECEIPTS AWAY IT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE SO. A MASSIVE. SO YEAH I WOULD SAY THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BE. SAFEGUARD THE TREES TO THE UTMOST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND I ADMIT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ANY AYE ARE YOU SEE A LARGE AREA THAT IS MARKED. THAT MIGHT INVOLVE THE PROJECT FROM L. TO N. TO TEN. AND OF COURSE THE WALKWAY BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA DISTURB ALL THAT GROUND. AND I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE DRIVEWAYS. SO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO WALK THE LENGTH OF THE PARK BESIDE THE BUILDING CAN DO SO WITHOUT RUNNING INTO THAT. THAT FENCE ON BOTH SIDES. I FEEL THAT IS A GREAT ADDITION. AND JUST A LINE OF SIGHT THAT THAT WOULD AFFORD OF THIS VISTA WITHIN THE PARK. AND. YEAH I CONSIDER THAT OF. ON THE FUNDING GENERALLY THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WORK OUT WITH THE GOVERNOR WE WILL BE IN A POSITION TO MOVE INTO THE SPRING SPACE IN OCTOBER OF NEXT YEAR. THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE SOMETHING THAT. VIEW THE LANDS OF THE ANY CONVENTIONS THE CALIFORNIA A LETTER THE JASINSKI OF EVERYTHING WE START MUCKING OUT UP A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE WERE IN ONE PLACE AND THEN THE CHAMBERS ARE OVER HERE WORKING WAITING SESSIONS WE WILL USE OUR BIG HEARING ROOMS IN THE NEW BUILDING BUT THEY'LL BE OTHER HEARING ROOM STILL OVER HERE PEOPLE BE. SHUTTLING BACK AND FORTH- PEOPLE WHO COME TO PARTICIPATE WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH METAL DETECTORS MULTIPLE TIMES IN ORDER TO VISIT DIFFERENT PLACES AND- YOU KNOW I TOTALLY AGREE THAT THERE IS AN ECONOMIC VALUE FROM DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY FROM PROJECT ACTIVITY- I THANK AS THEY DID A HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO YOU SORT OF TAKE THE LONG VIEW. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- I BELIEVE WILL INDEED BENEFIT OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. IN NINETEEN FIFTY TWO WE DIDN'T HAVE MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIRS IN THE BILL THEIR PEOPLE WITH. SERIOUS IMPAIRMENTS. TO BE ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS THE GOVERNMENT LIFE IN THE SAME WAY THEY DO TODAY. AND YET THEY COME TO THE STATE CAPITOL TODAY AND THEIR- YOU KNOW. I MAY GO THIS WAY YOU HAVE TO GO ANOTHER WAY WE HAVE THESE LIFT WOULD SEEM A LITTLE PRECARIOUS OF YOUR WATCH OF. AN OPERATION IT'S DEFINITELY KINDA LIVING OUT THE CAPITALS VALUES- TO WELCOME PEOPLE TO THE BUILDING. SO I SORT OF FEEL LIKE THE LONG TERM GOAL IS TO ALIGN THE CAPITAL WITH THESE. BASIC VALUES. BUT PART OF IT WAS. HOW MANY JOBS ARE CREATED PUTS THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR- FOR THE REGION. I'M IT'S A IT'S A GREAT GREAT QUESTION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND- BECAUSE WE DID THE UTAH STATE CAPITOL DURING THE RECESSION AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- WE WERE TOLD IS THAT- CONSTRUCTION TYPICALLY TURNS A DOLLAR BETWEEN NINE AND ELEVEN TIMES SO AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT TEN TIMES WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST TURNS WITHIN THE ECONOMY. SO BY BUILDING CONSTRUCTION YOU ACTUALLY MOVE MORE MONEY INTO THE ECONOMY AND YOU GET MORE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND IT AND TO UTILIZE IT THAN YOU DO IN ANY THEN AND THE OTHER SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY AS I UNDERSTAND IT. SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S BENEFICIAL AND THEN JUST TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT TREES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING TO PROTECT THE TREES IS REMOVING THE RAPS OUT. INTO THE STREET WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO SO THAT WE- DON'T HAVE TO TEAR UP THE TREES WITH WITHIN THE SITE THAT IS. ADDING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE OVERALL BUDGET PART OF THAT. 710% OVERAGE IS BECAUSE WE ARE BUILDING THOSE RAMPS. AND SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH THAT- BUT THE IDEA IS TO SAVE THOSE. THOSE TREES. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE WE BROKE THE TREES INTO THREE CATEGORIES- THOSE TREES THAT ARE- HISTORIC. AND PARDON ARE BEING SAVED OR OR OR MOVED. WITHIN DEAL WITH THE TREES THAT- HAVE TO BE REMOVED OR REPLACED AND THEN WE HAVE THE- THE PALM TREES AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL AS WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH GROUP OF THOSE TREES. SO THAT WE ARE DOING THE VERY BEST WE CAN TO MINIMIZE THE DISRUPTION. TO THE SITE WITH REGARDS TO TREES AND TO THE DESIGN THAT'S WHY THE PARKING STRUCTURE WAS MOVED. FROM THE SOUTH WHERE WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT GO INITIALLY. TO THE EAST BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT WE WERE ABLE TO. REALLY SAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF TREES. MISTER HART JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SINCE YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU DID THE UTAH CAPITOL DURING A RECESSION. HOW MUCH LOWER THE ACTUAL. COST SCHOOL BELOW YOUR- ESTIMATES RESERVE 10% 20% SAVINGS BECAUSE- YOU COULD PRICE THINGS MUCH BETTER SURE- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE UTAH CAPITOL. WAS HAPPENING DURING A- AN ECONOMIC RECESSION DURING THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. AND SO IT WAS LARGELY JUST A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY THERE FOR WHAT WE SAW WE SAW A LOWERING. OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE SAW LOWERING OF ECONOMIC SPENDING- WHICH IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY WHICH IS I THINK THE POINT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO. TODAY THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT- THE MATERIALS. ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY- AND SO. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN YOUR TYPICAL. RECESSION ORDER OR OR SLOWDOWN OF THE ECONOMY BECAUSE WHAT'S FORCING THAT IS BECAUSE WORKERS ARE ABLE TO GO AND DO THE WORK THEY NORMALLY DO AND PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS THEY TYPICALLY PRODUCE. RATHER THAN SEEING IT REDUCING COST WE'RE SEEING SOME PRODUCTS ACTUALLY RAISING COST. WE DO THINK THAT OVERALL- MOVING INTO THIS YEAR AND INTO NEXT YEAR WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING A REDUCTION. OF ESCALATION AND WE BELIEVE THAT ESCALATION WILL EITHER BE FLAT OR LOWER OVER THE NEXT YEAR. BY PERCENT OR TO THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST AND WE HAVE AN ECONOMIST WHO WORKS. FOR US WHO IS PROJECTING THAT THAT ESCALATION WILL FLATTEN OUT ACTUALLY DROP. THERE MAY BE SOME SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY TO GO UP AND SOME OF THOSE WILL HOLD FLAT SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THE TYPICAL RECESSION VERY GOOD. ASSEMBLY WOMAN COME LONGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS VERY COMPREHENSIVE PRESENTATION- MY QUESTIONS ARE ALONG THE- LINES OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT JUST SPOKE. YOU KNOW AS THE STATE IS TIGHTENING. OUR BUDGET BELT. I DO THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD AND I KNOW WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AT AN EARLIER JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING BUT IT IT MIGHT BE NICE AS A REFRESHER JUST TO GET AN ESTIMATED NUMBER OF JOBS- THAT IT WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE THE ENTIRE PROJECT BECAUSE AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A RECESSION AS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW UNEMPLOYMENT- IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A COUNTER WITH REAL NUMBERS AS IT RELATES TO JOBS- THAT WILL BE. CREATED AS A RESULT OF THIS- AT ENDEAVOR. I ALSO THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO ALSO HAVE SOME REAL NUMBERS AROUND THE PAST CONSIDERATIONS FOR DELAY IN MY PRIOR. LIFE ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD WE WERE DEALING WITH CONSTRUCTION. I CRY SEVEN CAMPUSES AND EVERY SMALL THING IN KHURDA CAR. AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE MAKING AESTHETIC DECISIONS AND THEN OTHER TIMES ARE MAKING BUDGETARY DECISIONS SO. IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AT LEAST FOR ME JUST TO GET A FROM FROM WHAT THE CAR CONSIDERING WOULD FOR THE LAKE OF THE VISITORS CENTER. ABOUT MY HAVE IS THIS FOR CONTRAST SO ARE THE ANNEXED BY IS IN SIZE TO THE NATURAL RESOURCE HEADQUARTERS WERE BUILDING DOWN THE STREET ON THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT REPORTING TO WORK SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WORKER MONTHS WHICH MEANS A WORKER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS WORKING FOR A MONTH ON UP ON THAT PROJECT SO IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK FOR WORKERS THAT WERE PUT IN TO WORK ON A PROJECT LIKE THIS. THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. V. SO I MEAN I'VE I'M TO THE THIRTY DESIGN BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK I'M ALSO PARTIAL TO THE DESIGN THAT MIGHT COME IN UNDER BUDGET MOST QUICKLY AND ALSO TO THE DESIGN THAT WILL SAVE THE MOST SPACE I FEEL YOU KNOW AS WE'RE DEALING WITH. WILDFIRESIT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY HEY OF THE YEAR. I CAN'T GET ENOUGH. OF THE OXYGEN THAT COMES FROM TREES AND SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO FACE HAS MANY OF THEM. I AM FOR. AND THEN LASTLY I JUST I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW. PARDEE DESIGNS REFEREE TWO OTHER MUNICIPAL BUILDING BECAUSE I OFTENTIMES OR SOME SORT OF HISTORICAL REFERENCE ALL CONNECTION TO THE DESIGN SO I JUST ADDED NUMBER THREE I MENTIONED THAT WHEN SHE WAS IN MEXICO CITY SHE WAS IN A BUILDING THAT WAS CIRCULAR. AND SO I JUST I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT WAS IN HERE I DIDN'T SEE IT. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE MY QUESTION. YES I GENEVA PLEASE GO AHEAD- IT'S INTERESTING THAT. IF YOU GO BACK TO SOME OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN AND SOME OF THE POLYNESIAN AND SOME OF THE SOUTH AMERICA SOUTH. PACIFIC ISLANDER PEOPLE A LOT OF THEIR CEREMONIAL GATHERINGS WHERE THE CHIEFS WOULD COME TOGETHER TO TALK WOULD BE IN A CIRCULAR BUILDING SO IT'S KIND OF AN INTERESTING THING I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE DIDN'T START WITH THAT IN MIND I THINK THE- THEN THE NOTION OF A CIRCULAR BUILDING IF YOU LOOK AT- THERE'S A BUILDING AND- FRANCE I BELIEVE THAT IS THE- EUROPEAN UNION'S HEADQUARTERS A CIRCULAR- AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF. OF BUILDINGS ARE CIRCULAR KIND OF THE NOTES- UNITY AND IT KIND OF THE NOTES- THAT NO- EVERYBODY'S KIND OF THE CORE. WHICH I THINK IS VERY GOOD THAT THE DOUBLE T. IS REALLY A- A BUILDING THAT HAS KIND OF EVOLVED FROM THE NOTION OF HOW DO WE SAVE. AS MANY TREES AS WE POSSIBLY CAN SO PULLING THE CONSTRUCTION AWAY AND THEN ALLOWING THE FIRST TEE SO TO SPEAK TO BE SHORTER. AND THE OTHER ONE TO BE A LITTLE A LITTLE FURTHER OUT AND THE SQUARE IS TRYING TO TAKE A MINIMALISTIC APPROACH. I DON'T KNOW JOSE IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT YEAH SURE YEAH THERE'S ALWAYS A- METAPHOR FOR A- CONNECTION YOU KNOW FOR WHAT. WHATEVER THAT MAY MEAN THAT THE CIRCLE. HE IT IS A GALLAGHER. LET'S SAY THAT ANOTHER- YEAH COMMITTEE JUST BECAUSE OF CONTINUED FOR THE CLUB AND ALL FIVE RIGHT- EAT YET WE HAVE ONLY TWO CORNERS BECAUSE OF THE INCISION WHERE MAKING TO MAKE THE ENTRY BUT IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT. EVERY SPACES SIDE WOULD BE PRETTY EQUAL. AND IN A SENSE. THAT IS- A BIT OF A DEMOCRACY MY OPINION- THAT THAT EVERYONE HAS A VOICE AND EVERYONE. HAS AN EQUAL SO THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF ET METAPHOR THERE'S THAT THAT ONE CAN MAKE A CONNECTION EIGHT ALSO SOME. THAT IN THIS BUILDING THAT THAT THAT THAT'S ALL RIGHT IN THE- UNDERNEATH IS. THE PLAZA IN FRONT THE EARTH THAN THAT. FIVE FORGET THE NAME OF THE OTHER BUILDING IS ALSO SO. A IN THE APT THE WITH A OUT HAD HELLO THE CIRCULAR EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT COME CIRCLE. SO THERE IS SOME SORT OF A PRESS OF FUNDING. IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE HAS SOME OF THE ORIGINAL PLAN OF THE PART THEY WERE AN OLD. IN THE AREA THAT MUST BE CARRIED IN THE BACK THAT. IS FELLOW JUST TO BE GIVE PRESS PREFERENCE TO THAT TO THE THAT EAST WEST AXIS WHICH IS AB. IN THE SORT OF PERSPECTIVE. SO THERE ARE SOME PRESS FOR THAT. THAT WILL BE A THE RED. BUILDINGS ARE VERY WELL AS HERE THIS BILL IS I MAY CUTTING. OF THAT SO THAT NOTHING WRONG WITH THE OTHER AS WELL SO THAT THAT SORT OF MY PERSPECTIVE. I WANT TO ASK A THE SMALL THE BEFORE I GO TO THE GAL. PHONE OPERATOR IS SENATOR BOB HERTZBERG ON THE LINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. IS IT CENTERS SENATOR HERTZBERG IS ONLINE YOU MAY PRESS STAR THEN ZERO. WELL WE'RE DOING ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF GENERALS COMMITTEE ON THE FLOOR. FOR MATHIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THINK WE FOR A LOT OF COMMENTS I THINK A LOT OF US BORROWED INGREDIENTS I THINK MY BIGGEST QUESTION RIGHT NOW AND I. IS IT- IT'S UNFORTUNATELY- THAT WE DO NOT HAVE QUORUM TODAY BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF US WOULD WANT TO VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD- JUST IN THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT IF. WE CAN SAY LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SQUARE THE CIRCLE LEARN THE DOUBLE T. DAN. OUR FOLKS THAT ARE DOING ALL OF THIS GREAT WORK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM TODAY THEN THEY'RE NOT SPENDING EXTRA TIME AND MONEY. LOOKING AT THESE OTHER OPTIONS. I WISH THAT WE COULD SAY HEY LET'S TAKE THE DOUBLE T. OFF THE TABLE OR YOU KNOW LET'S FIND TO DATE BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE A CAR I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURE ON THAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH THE AUTHORITY- OF THE CHAIRS. BLUT A THINK THAT IF WE GET. KIND OF BRING IT DOWN- WE WOULD ALSO SEE A LOT OF MONEY INCOME A LOT OF TIME ON FOR THOSE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THIS PLANNING PROCESS SIX SPECIALLY AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER BY OUR COLLEAGUES- WITH THE RECESSION WITH EVERYTHING ELSE FOR EVERYBODY VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE SPENDING ADDITIONAL FONTS A DEFINING UNFORTUNATELY THAT WE DO NOT HAVE MEMBERS HERE- PERSONALLY AFTER LOOKING AT EVERYTHING AFTER LOOKING AT ALL THE NUMBERS AFTER LOOKING AT THE ECOLOGICAL REPORTS ON YOU KNOW HOW WE SEE THE MOST TREES. HOW DO WE SAVE THE MOST MONEY- SECURITY PUBLIC SPACE EVERYTHING- I THINK THE BEST THIS. MODEL FOR US TO GO FORWARD WITH WOULD BE THE CIRCLE. I DO APPRECIATE THE HISTORY LESSON ON ON WITH THE. WHERE THE CIRCLE CAME FROM MY IT REMINDS ME OF- MY OLD ART HISTORY CLASSES BUT- WE LIKE TAMARA GRECO ROMAN AND COLISEUM'S IN THOSE THINGS- GOING BACK AND SOME OF YOU IN THE GOTHIC DESIGN. VOIGTS I THINK THE MEANING BEHIND THAT ALSO CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT. BUT THE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC SPACE- THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO SEE THE DOWN ON THE TICKET AND THE BILL TO HAVE THAT GALLERY TO SHOWCASE- ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF CALIFORNIA. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WELL BUT- AGAIN THE QUESTION IS MORE OF. IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE AN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION WHICH IS USUALLY SOMETHING I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF- TO CUT SOME TIME AND MONEY SO. OUR DESIGN TEAM ISN'T SPINNING THEIR WHEELS ON SOMETHING MOST OF US ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH YEAH I ANTICIPATE THAT WHILE. I DO SEE THAT. SCHEDULE A JOINT RULES COMMITTEE MEETING BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH. AND BRING UP FOR FOUR DECISION. AND I THINK OF. OUR DESIGN TEAM I HAVE TO SAY IS AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB TO CONJURE UP THREE FAIRLY CONCRETE ALTERNATIVES TO BRING IT TO THIS BODY. I ASKED THEM TO DO THAT I DIDN'T FEEL AS MY PROGRESS TO MAKE A CHOICE I FEEL THE LAW GIVES J. R. C. PREEMINENT. RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION. AND BUT I THINK THEY HAVE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR. COMMENTARY TODAY WHICH WILL HELP THEM START FOCUSING. BUT EVERYTHING MUST BE DONE IN A PROPER MANNER. AND WE'RE WE ARE NOT DONE WE HAVE PURSES HERE TO COMMENT ON FRIDAY YOUR POINTS ARE VERY WELL MADE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND- WE DID NOT HAVE ALL THIS MATERIAL TOGETHER FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO BUT WE HAD A TOWARD RULES MEETING. TO START GIVING MORE DIRECTION AND MARCH. AND IT'S STILL ON THE WEBSITE IT WAS CANCELED. AND OF COURSE THEN THE YEAR TOOK THE COURSE IT TOOK. AND SO WE ARE NOW BACK ON TASK AND MOVING FORWARD- SO WE WILL MOVE WITH ALACRITY- A SIMILAR MATHIS. AND TURNING NOW TO. WITNESSES IN THE CHAMBERS WITH US. I WOULD JUST ASK YOU TO. IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND I'M GOING TO ASK FOR TWO MINUTES OF COMMENTS BUT PLEASE JUMP IN THIS PROJECT OUR- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN COOLEY A RICHER CAL ONE WITH PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR CAPITAL. I SEE THE DESIGN FOR THE VISITOR CENTER WE'RE SEEING TODAY OR TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT WAS IN THE RECIRCULATED DRAFT E. IR. I JUST NOTE THAT- THE NEW PARKING LOCATION THE STRIP ALONG TWELFTH STREET IS ABSOLUTELY NOT IN THE PREVIOUS E. I. R. IF WE TRUST THE ARBORIST THAT ANYTHING FIFTY FEET FROM AN EXCAVATION. WOULD PUT IT RISK AT. I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT THE PARKING GARAGE LOCATION WOULD IMPINGE WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE CIVIL WAR GROWTH AND I KNOW THAT'S VERY PERSONALLY VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU- SO IT CAUTIONED THERE IT APPEARS THE DOUBLE T. SCHEME VIOLATES WHAT IN THE ARE WAS A PRIEST THE I. R. WAS A PRECEPT. WE WOULD NOT GO BEYOND THE NORTH AND SOUTH BOUNDARIES OF THE HISTORIC CAPITAL. THE CIRCLE SEEMS SEEMS SCHEME SEEMS TO DO THAT ALSO- AND IT ALSO PROTRUDES INTO THE TWELFTH ST ALIGNMENT WHICH WAS PRESERVED IN THE E. I. R. IT SEEMS ALL THREE SCHEMES GO ABOVE THE PARAPET. OF THE- RESTORED CAPITAL AGAIN A PRECEPT I THOUGHT WE HAD PRESERVED IN THE- E. IR N. FOR A PROJECT THAT WAS BASED ON ON GOSH WE REALLY NEED MORE SPACE- THE VERY VERY LARGE GALLERIES. TAKING UP A LOT OF SQUARE FEET IN MULTIPLE FLOORS- SEEM LIKE THEY WOULD BE SOMETHING KIND OF HARD TO EXPLAIN. AND FINALLY AS A FORMER CONTRACTOR I KNOW THE BLUE BOOK ESTIMATE ON THE VISITORS CENTER WAS TWENTY NINE MILLION AND IT DIDN'T SAY IT DID NOT INCLUDE THE SOFT COSTS AS SO FROM TWENTY NINE UP TO WHAT ARE WE SEVENTY EIGHT. HE PRETTY BIG JOB THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR CALLING. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE PUBLIC GALLERY WISHING TO SPEAK I SEE THERE IS NONE.

THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT THE REST OF STATE GOVERNMENT IS ASKING ITSELF RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR CALLED COURT IS MAY REVISED WHEN HE PUT DEBATE ON ROADS AND NATURAL RESOURCES BUILDING PROJECTS ON PAUSE. PENDING A STATEWIDE EVALUATION OF OFFICE SPACE NEEDS. INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT REDUCED OPERATE NEEDS TO THE REMOTE WORKING OR THE LESS COSTLY OPTION A RENOVATION OF THE HISTORIC STATE CAPITAL. THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE HAS DONE THE OPPOSITE TODAY PROVIDING A BIGGER FIGHT TWEETED OPTIONS THAT IS SHOCKINGLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT PROPOSED BY THE REVISED DVR. THE THREE OPTIONS LOOK LIKE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF A WORRISOME APPROACH UNDERSTATEMENT ORIGINAL CAPITOL BUILDING WHICH MEMBERS OF THE JOINT RULES YOU CAN'T SAY NO THINK OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE LOST JOBS THE PERILOUS FINANCES THE ILLNESS AND DEATHS AND FAMILIES TORN APART BY THREATEN DISRUPTION. TO CLOSE BUSINESSES AND CHALLENGING SCHOOL ON HEALTHCARE CRISES IF YOU TELL ME CONSTITUENTS YOU'RE VOTING TO SUPPORT OF BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT FOR YOUR OPPOSITE THAT THEY'LL BE PAYING FOR LIKE ABOUT CREDIT CARD FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR DESIGN AND BE TREATED IT IT APPEARS THAT THE DESIGN GOES AROUND THAT WOULD HELP THE ATHLETES COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THE INTENTION IS BUILT AROUND LARGE TREES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE FOOT PRINT OF THAT. NEW PARKING DESIGN. BUT IT WITH THE PARKING LOT AND PUT GIVEN THE VEHICLE AND ENTRANCE A THE LARGE CONTRIBUTION FOR GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS AND THAT'S- I THINK IT WOULD SHAMEFUL FOR THE FLIGHT TO DEVELOPED AND UP PARK LOT AT THE- OF CAPITAL PARK IS THE TOP TRIAL. AND I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO DO ALL IT CAN WITH ENOUGH POWER TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT THE TREES AND ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC CAN PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS AND PROVIDING FEEDBACK AND TO THAT END I WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED WE CALCULATED DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REVIEW GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE.
