00:39:47.918 --> 00:39:49.787
AND I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.055
SOME OF THE DISCREPANCIES.

00:39:51.122 --> 00:39:52.923
WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS OVERLY

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:55.126
PRESCRIPTIVE --

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:55.693
FOR INSTANCE I THINK THAT IT

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.762
LIMITS PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WHEN

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.964
YOU DON'T ALLOW SCHOOLS CHARTER

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.465
SCHOOLS TO MEET AT DIFFERENT

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:02.767
SITES -- THE

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:03.367
SCHOOL BOARD THAT I SIT ON WE

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.236
PRIDE OURSELVES IN BOARD

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.637
MEETINGS ARE NOT PARTICULARLY

00:40:06.704 --> 00:40:08.272
ENTERTAINING AND WE REALLY WORK

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.673
TO GET FOLKS INVOLVED IN AT OUR

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.374
MEETINGS.

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.709
SO WE REACH OUT AND GO TO A

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.110
DIFFERENT SCHOOL SITES THIS

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:14.211
PROHIBITS CHARTER SCHOOLS FROM

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.880
DOING THAT AND THAT SEEMS

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.448
PARTICULARLY PUNITIVE AND AND

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:19.750
SORT OF OPPOSITE OF WHAT THIS

00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:21.585
BILL IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:23.154
IN ADDITION OTHER THE

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.688
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARD I SAID

00:40:24.755 --> 00:40:26.056
WE DO IN FACT BROADCAST OUR

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:28.325
MEETINGS BUT THERE ISN'T A TWO

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:28.893
WAY --

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.895
REQUIREMENT AND SO WHEN WE

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:32.229
POSTED ONLINE THERE'S ONLY THE

00:40:32.296 --> 00:40:34.632
TRANSMISSION OF WHAT FOLKSY FROM

00:40:34.698 --> 00:40:36.233
OUR BROADCAST.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.968
THE IDEA THAT SOME OF OUR

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:38.569
CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE MULTIPLE

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:41.438
OUTLETS THE COST OF HAVING TO DO

00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:43.073
ALL OF IT TO A TRANSMISSION

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.542
RECORDED AND THEN POSTED.

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:45.943
WE THINK IS PARTICULARLY ONEROUS

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.444
IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE CHARTER

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:50.080
SCHOOLS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GET

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.582
REIMBURSED FOR STATE MANDATES.

00:40:51.649 --> 00:40:54.285
SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST IT'S

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:56.587
AN ADDITIONAL --

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:57.354
IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST AND

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:58.055
SOMETHING THAT THAT --

00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:59.290
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:00.958
DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH SO

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:02.293
IT'S REALLY NOT THE SAME AS

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.228
TRADITIONAL SCHOOL BOARDS --

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.429
AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:07.064
THINK THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:08.799
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS BILL

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:09.733
AND YET ANOTHER WAY THAT CHARTER

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.069
SCHOOLS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.904
PUBLIC AGENCIES --

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.773
IN IN THE WAY THAT TRADITIONAL

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.241
SCHOOLS ARE.

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.777
THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHERS

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.012
IN OPPOSITION --

ELECTION OFFICIALS.

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:27.284
WE FALL.

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:28.686
SORT PROBABLY OUTSIDE OF THE THE

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:31.522

OR OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE --

FIRST OF ALL WANT TO THANK --

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:41.952
OF THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:42.553
FORWARD --

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:43.554
BUT THOSE HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.388
LITTLE WHILE KNOW THAT THE ISSUE

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:47.024
OF MEETINGS IN TRANSPARENCY AND

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:48.859
ALL THE KINDS OF THINGS AT

00:43:48.926 --> 00:43:50.327
AFFILIATED WITH IT.

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:51.662
HAVE HAD A VERY LONG AND

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.497
STRUGGLING HISTORY OF IN TERMS

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:55.332
OF TRYING TO GET SOME AGREEMENT

00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:56.300
AND UNDERSTANDING.

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.835
AND I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT

00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:00.237
THAT -- THAT

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.239
THE GOVERNOR --

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:05.042
BASICALLY OF PUSH THIS THROUGH --

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.876
IT WITH SOME --

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.044
BALANCE I THINK IN TERMS OF SOME

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:07.711
OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN THE

00:44:07.778 --> 00:44:09.747
PAST WHAT WE SEE TODAY SO.

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:10.647
I THINK IT DOES IT IT BUT IT

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:11.782
STRIKES A BALANCE THERE ARE

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:13.517
STILL SOME ISSUES I THINK THAT

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:14.351
NEED TO BE RESOLVED AS POINTED

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.319
OUT -- I

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:16.954
THINK OUR SCHOOLS SCHOOLS SHOULD

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:19.223
HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS.

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:19.857
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:21.158
ATTEMPTING TO DO --

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:23.360
AND YET OF SOMEONE BRINGS FOR TO

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.495
US SOME THINGS WHICH I KNOW ARE

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:26.463
NOT ALWAYS TRUE BECAUSE I WAS ON

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:27.831
THE SCHOOL BOARD AND WE DID MEET

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.700
IN DIFFERENT SITES BECAUSE EVERY

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:30.768
NOW AND THEN WANT TO GO TO A

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:31.368
DIFFERENT SCHOOL A DIFFERENT

00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:32.236
PLACE.

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.204
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY TO BRING

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:36.507
PEOPLE TOGETHER BOOK BOARD

00:44:36.573 --> 00:44:38.108
MEETING SO THE FACT THAT IF

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.309
YOU'RE RESTRICTING FOLKS FROM

00:44:39.376 --> 00:44:40.611
HAVING MEETINGS OF IN ONE PLACE

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:42.079
IT BECOMES DIFFICULT.

00:44:42.146 --> 00:44:44.481
AND WHEN WE DO DO OF A TELEVISED

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:45.916
OF THINGS FOR SCHOOL BOARD IS

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:46.884
NOT TO WAY.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:47.985
SO THAT COULD BE A DIFFICULT

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.753
PIECE AND I I HOPE PEOPLE LOOK

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.055
AT THAT BEFORE IT GOES TO THE

00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:52.356
FLOOR TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME CUT

00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:54.024
COMBINATIONS THAT CAN BE MADE.

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.259
EITHER IN OUR BUDGET --

00:44:55.325 --> 00:44:56.393
SITUATION BECAUSE WE

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.962
OCCASIONALLY DO FUND MANDATES OF

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.097
BY CHARTERS WE MAKE THOSE

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:02.299
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT TO MAKE SURE

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:03.367
THAT WE'RE NOT BASICALLY BEING

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.436
OVERLY BURDENSOME TO CHARTER

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:06.737
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.105
AND WE CAN CREATE THESE NEW

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:08.338
RULES.

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:09.740
WHEN IN REALITY IF THEY SHOULD

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.941
BE TREATED LIKE THE REGULAR

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:12.409
PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH A KIND OF

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:13.944
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY

00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:15.946
THAT ALL PARENTS WANT FROM THEIR

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:16.680
SCHOOLS --

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.714
SO I'M PLEASED THAT THAT WE'VE

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:19.116
DONE THAT I HOPE THAT BEFORE

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:19.883
THIS GOES TO THE FLOOR THAT

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.485
THERE IS AN HONEST EFFORT TO

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:22.519
LOOK AT THOSE TWO ISSUES.

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:23.554
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BECAUSE

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.988
THEY ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:26.523
THEY DO DISTINGUISH CHARTIST

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.025
MOTHERS IN TERMS OF HAVING

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:33.297
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE OWNERS --

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.298
LIKE EVERY SCHOOL I THINK IT

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:35.699
LIKE I SAID THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:37.134
THAT WORK THAT WE'VE DONE HERE --

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:37.434
I WOULD --

00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:38.102
PROBABLY TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:39.403
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.238
CHARGES ARE OR EITHER HEALTH HOW

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:44.108
DIFFICULT IT IS FOR OF ALL THE

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:45.242
THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE BECAUSE

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:46.777
IF YOU'VE BEEN AROUND SCHOOLS

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:47.377
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TIME YOU

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:48.112
KNOW THAT THAT STUFF IS

00:45:48.178 --> 00:45:49.279
APPLICABLE TO ALMOST.

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:50.714
ALL OF THE SCHOOLS AND NOT JUST

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.483
TO CHARTERS IN TERMS OF MONEY

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:54.184
AND WHERE GOALS AND SCHOOLS THAT

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.819
ARE IN RECEIVERSHIP AND NOT IN

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:57.187
RECEIVERSHIP AND WERE HAVING

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.422
DIFFICULTY IN BANKRUPTCY.

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.157
I MEAN IT'S JUST GOES ON AND ON

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.725
AND AND THERE'S A LOT NOT BLAME

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:02.860
TO GO AROUND --

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:05.062
WITHOUT ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON ONE

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.096
SIDE WOULD HATE FOLKS TO THINK

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:07.464
THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.398
DESIGNED BECAUSE OF THE FACT

00:46:08.465 --> 00:46:09.766
THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT.

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:12.436
HAVE GONE AWRY --

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:15.806
IT IT GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:16.974
AND IT SHOULD BE A PART OF THE

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:17.574
CONVERSATION I TAKES PLACE ALL

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:18.542
THE TIME.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:19.743
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.311
OF CHARTER STUFF COMING FOR THIS

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:22.079
YEAR BY UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE

00:46:22.146 --> 00:46:22.880
TELL ME.

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:23.780
I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S FORMED A

00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:25.182
COMMITTEE --

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:26.016
TO BASICALLY DEAL WITH THIS

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.951
ISSUE I'M OPTIMISTIC AND I KNOW

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:29.553
HE HAD A HAND IN THIS BUT I AM

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.021
OPTIMISTIC AND HOPEFUL.

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.122
THAT -- MANY

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:33.157
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

00:46:33.223 --> 00:46:34.791
BEEN FACING IN THIS UNNECESSARY

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.226
BATTLE FOR THE LAST.

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:37.427
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS NOW

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:38.862
WILL HOPEFULLY BE RESOLVED TO A

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:40.397
BALANCE COMMITTEE --

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.231
THAT WE WILL GET SOME GOOD

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.700
RECOMMENDATIONS AND I WOULD HOPE

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:44.601
THAT AS A COMMITTEE OF IT.

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:45.802
THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN BOTH

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:47.804
HOUSES THAT WE WOULD MAKE EVERY

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:48.739
EFFORT TO WAIT TO GET THE

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.474
RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE WE MOVE

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:51.909
FOR WITH A LOT OF LEGISLATION.

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:52.876
I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:54.378
BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A VERY

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:56.146
DIFFICULT SUBJECT.

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:58.582
ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AND IF

00:46:58.649 --> 00:46:59.149
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BLUE

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:00.617
RIBBON COMMITTEE THAT'S LOOKING

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:01.985
AT CHARTER SCHOOLS.

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:03.587
WE SHOULD TRY TO DO OUR BEST TO

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:04.521
WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY COME UP

00:47:04.588 --> 00:47:05.088
WITH.

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.357
OTHERWISE WE FIND OURSELVES ONCE

00:47:07.424 --> 00:47:10.327
AGAIN IS THAT WE SHOULD AND THIS

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:13.263
IS ENOUGH DECISION [inaudible]

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:16.700
GOVERNOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:18.702
WE TAKE OUR TIME TO MAKE SURE

00:47:18.769 --> 00:47:19.803
THAT THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.939
RAISED HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.874
THROUGH WITH SOME THOUGHT --

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.508
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:25.709
DO -- THE

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:27.144
UNFORTUNATE THING OF BEING IN

00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.179
THE ASSEMBLY.

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:30.614
I MEAN LEGISLATURE PERIOD IS

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:31.415
THAT OFTENTIMES IS NOT ENOUGH

00:47:31.481 --> 00:47:32.449
CONVERSATION.

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.051
IS NOT ENOUGH ACTUAL WORKING

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:35.919
COMMITTEES THAT ACTUALLY FOCUS

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.021
ON THESE ISSUES AND GIVE TIME

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:39.456
FOR IT TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THE

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:40.691
REALM OF LEGISLATION.

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.125
AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:44.394
CHARTERS IS SO IMPORTANT --

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:46.496
IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AND WITH

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.131
SUCH A TURNING POINT A CRITICAL

00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:50.067
POINT OF FIGURING OUT WHAT WE'RE

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.536
GOING TO DO IN AND WE'VE BEEN

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:53.103
FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS OF WAR

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.104
CHARTERS.

00:47:54.171 --> 00:47:55.105
WITHOUT REALLY CLEAR

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:57.074
CONVERSATION ACROSS THE BOARD

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.642
AND WE'VE WORKED INTO THINGS

00:47:58.709 --> 00:47:59.309
THAT MAYBE WE DIDN'T WANT TO GO

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.044
INTO AND DIDN'T PRESERVE OF

00:48:01.111 --> 00:48:02.246
THINGS WITH OVER IMPORTANT AND

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:04.481
ON AND ON THAT --

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:05.816
THE BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE THAT'S

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:07.117
BEING FORMED BY THIS NEW

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:08.652
SUPERINTENDENT OF IN A PUBLIC

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.053
INSTRUCTION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.989
BLESSING OF I HOPE WE'LL HAVE

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:13.924
SOME GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.492
BY THE BUT AT THE END OF THEIR

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:16.560
TURN TIME.

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.095
THAT WE CAN THEN USE THAT AS A

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.197
AS A A A PLATFORM FOR THE

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:21.798
DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION THAT

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:22.899
WE THINK WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:23.967
CHARTERS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.168
WE GO FORWARD.

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:26.303
AND THAT WE DON'T RUSSIA HERE

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.471
BUT I THINK THIS PIECE OF

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:29.039
LEGISLATION IS TIMES COME IT'S

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:30.907

RAISE WILL BE ALSO CONTINUING

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:42.386
