SANTA ANA CONDITIONS AND ANA WINDS WHEN THEY COME UP FROM INLAND AND GO TOWARDS THE COAST AS OPPOSED TO THE PREVAILING TRADE WINDS AND IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE ASSUMING DAILY AND I EXPERIENCED -- A FIRE IN LAGUNA BEACH THAT -- DESTROYED FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE HOMES IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME IN THE IN THE FALL SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE I JUST KIND OF DID SOME RIVER VIEW BECAUSE THE GOING TO BEACH IS ON MY DISTRICT AND THAT THE FIRE WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE AND OF THOSE HOMES TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS AND IN AND NINE IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THREE YEARS LATER THE LA TIMES DID AN ARTICLE SAID GO WHAT'S THE STATUS IN ONLY A HUNDRED AND FORTY HOMES HAD BEEN REBUILT THREE YEARS LATER OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX SO I'M SITTING HERE GOING I SHOULDN'T EXPECT AN IMMEDIATE BUILDING OF HOMES YOU KNOW BUT THERE IS A PROCESS AND SOME MISTER CHAIR -- WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE GOT PRIOR HISTORY AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE HOW WE ARE IMPROVING FROM A GOOD TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO -- TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO NOW -- TO FIND A MODEL OF HOW WE ALL WORK WITH GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND THE HOMEOWNERS TO TRY TO BE AS EFFICIENT AT LEAST HAVE SOME BENCHMARKS OF WHERE PROGRESS SHOULD BE AT AT WHAT TIME AND AND HOW WE'RE IMPROVING WHATEVER BOMBS ARE IN THE WAY BUT IT IS A TIME CONSUMING PROCESS AND DO WE WE EXPERIENCE THAT THAT'S WHY I'M HERE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ALRIGHT SENATOR GLAZERS ARE YOU READY TO YEAH YOU KNOW WHETHER I THINK OPENING REMARKS AT LET'S START WITH PANEL NUMBER ONE I'D LIKE TO INVITE AT JIM LARSEN KEITH WOODS AND CHRIS ROGERS AND LET ME EXPLAIN WHO THEY ARE AND THEIR EXPERTISE THAT THEY BRING TO THE TO US THIS MORNING MISTER LARSON IS A EXECUTIVE GENERAL ADJUSTER FOR THE GREENSPAN COMPANY AND ADJUSTERS INTERNATIONAL I IS AN ATTORNEY IN LICENSE PUBLIC ADJUSTER IN SEVEN STATES AS A PUBLIC ADJUSTER HE REPRESENTS CONSUMERS WHEN NEGOTIATING A CLAIM SETTLEMENT AND CAN SPEAK TO THE CHALLENGES CONSUMERS OF HAD -- AND SETTLING THEIR CLAIMS -- THE SECOND WITH THIS IS KEITH WOULD SAY HE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF NORTH COAST BUILDERS EXCHANGE MISTER WOULD HEADS IN ASSOCIATION OF CONTRACTORS ARCHITECTS ENGINEERS BUILDING SUPPLY MEMBERS THAT SPANNED CINEMA LAKE MENDOCINO AND NAPA COUNTIES AND CHRIS ROGERS COUNCIL MEMBER FROM THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE CHRIS YEAH HE SERVES ON THE REBUILDING COMMITTEE FOR THE CITY AND THE JOINT REBUILDING COMMITTEE WITH CINEMA COUNTY HAS BEEN CLOSELY INVOLVED IN SANTA ROSA THIS RECOVERY EFFORTS SO WITH THAT WILL BEGIN WITH THAT MISTER LARSON THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME CENTERS -- I'VE BEEN ASKED TODAY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE A JUST ARE THE POLICY HOLDERS HAVE BEEN FACING THROUGH THE ADJUSTMENT CLAIMS I MEAN IT HAD SOME A JUST THREE HIGHLIGHTS ONE OF THE THINGS SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WHAT IS A PUBLIC ADJUSTER DO WE REPRESENT THE INSURED THROUGH THE CLIENT CLAIMS PROCESS -- WE NEGOTIATE WE INTERPRET INSURANCE CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND WE NEGOTIATED FARES SOLOMON FOR THE INSURED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THROUGH THE REPRESENT REPRESENTATION OF SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE IN SANTA ROSA -- THE ISSUES THAT THEY FACE IN THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS IS ONE OF THE ELONGATING THE PROCESS SO IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE UMBRELLA OF ISSUE THAT I'M FACED WITH ONE REPRESENTING CLIENTS IS IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME TO JUST THESE CLAIMS AND WHAT I'M SEEING ACROSS THE BOARD IS FOR MOST INSURERS IS A LOT OF TURNOVER OF ADJUSTERS SO WHAT IS THAT MEANS WE'LL START OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRE AND WILL HAVE ONE ADJUSTER TWO MONTHS LATER A NEW ADJUSTER IS ASSIGNED -- A WEEK LATER A NEW ADJUSTER DESIGN I'VE HAD SOME CLAIMS WHERE WE'VE HAD TAN ADJUSTERS IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS WHY IS THAT ALONG EIGHT THE PROCESS EVERY TIME YOU GET ANYWAYS OSTER YOU GOT TO RE EDUCATE THE ADJUSTER ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FILE AND TIME IS LOST THEY HAVE TO GET -- THEY HAVE TO TALK TO THEIR SUPERVISORS THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FILE AND FRANKLY IT'S TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE INSURED SAID I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT MY CLIENTS ARE FACING THE NUMBER TWO ISSUE THAT I'VE I'VE COME ACROSS IS OFTENTIMES ALL COME IN AFTER THE CLAIM IS A FEW WEEKS OLD AND THE KERRIER HIS STEP DÂN AND AND STARTED WORKING WITH THE INSURED -- WHEN I STEP AND I GO THROUGH THE POLICY AND I ADVISE THE INSURED OF ALL THEIR CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS OFTENTIMES THE INSURED IS JUST FINDING OUT ABOUT WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE -- I THINK THE INSURANCE -- INDUSTRY CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF ADVISING THEIR INSUREDS UP FRONT AS TO WHAT THE CONTRACT PROVIDES IN TERMS OF -- COVERAGES AND WHAT ARE THE INSURANCE RIGHTS TWO THING NUMBER THREE THING IS EVALUATION SO WHEN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CON MAN OFTENTIMES THEY HIRE FOLKS FROM OUT OF STATE AND THERE'S AN INDUSTRY WIDE PROGRAM THAT IS USED TO VALUE -- THE REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF THE HOUSE IT'S CALLED EXACT MADE AND THAT PROGRAM IS MERELY A TOOL YOU CAN HIRE EXACT INMATE TO REBUILD YOUR HOUSE -- YOU HAVE TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR AND THE CONTRACTOR IS GONNA TELL YOU WHAT THE MARKET VALUE IN THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE REBUILD YOUR HOME THESE THE THE TWO OF WILL VALUATIONS THE EXACT TO MADE AND THEN THE MARKET ARE IN OFTENTIMES CONGRUENT WITH EACH OTHER SO YOU'VE GOT ON ONE HAND YOU'VE GOT THE INSURANCE AND JUST INDUSTRY USING A TOOL TO SETTLE THE CLAIM BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALITY YOU CAN'T USE OFTENTIMES THE MONIES THAT EXACT INMATE IS COMING UP WITH FOR THE REBUILD THE HOME ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR MARKET CONDITIONS EITHER LABORS TO ALLOW OR OR -- OR MATERIALS ARE TO LOWER OR BOTH SO -- THOSE THE THREE HIGHLIGHTING ISSUES ITS VALUATION TURN OVER AND THE INSURED'S REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS -- THOSE THE THREE THINGS AND I'VE I'VE FOUND THAT THE KIND OF ELONGATE THE PROCESS THE VALUATION IS ME I'M STILL NEGOTIATING TWELVE MONTHS OUT FROM THE FIRE WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ON THE TRUE REPAIR VALUE OR REPLACEMENT VALUE OF THEIR HOME SO IMAGINE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO REBUILD YOUR HOME AND YOU'RE TRYING TO PLAN FOR THE FUTURE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR BUDGET FOR THE REBUILD SO YOU CAN'T REALLY START THE PROCESS OF HIRING A CONTRACTOR AND HIRING YOUR ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS UNTIL YOU'VE SETTLED ON THAT NUMBER SO THAT'S GOOD ALONG A THE PROCESS THANK YOU MISTER LARSON FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SOME QUESTIONS BUT I WANT TO GO TO THE PANEL FIRST AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND ALLOW -- QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES MISTER WOODS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE NORTH COAST BUILDERS EXCHANGE WE APPRECIATE YOUR WISDOM AND INSIGHT THANK YOU AND -- -- THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BID INTIMIDATING BECAUSE JUST THAT THIS PANEL SO DISTINGUISHED WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIST OF PANELISTS I'M THE ONLY ONE I'VE NEVER HEARD OF AN ILLICIT THIS EXTREMELY INTIMIDATING GOOD TO SEE MY FRIEND SENATOR DODD THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK -- LET ME EXPLAIN NORTH COAST BUILDERS EXCHANGE -- WHAT PERSPECTIVE I WANT TO BRING WE HAVE ROUGHLY TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEMBERS RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WHERE APPLE LAKE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY MIDDLE OF ALL OF THE REBUILD EFFORTS FOR THE PAST YEAR -- EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE LICENSE CONTRACTORS HALF FOR GENERAL CONTRACTORS HAVE FOR SUBCONTRACTORS AND I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THEM OVER THE PAST YEAR TO TRY AND GET A REAL FEEL FOR HOW OUR ORGANIZATION CAN HELP AND WHAT THE ISSUES ARE I'M I'M I'M NO EXPERT ON INSURANCE TO LEAVE THAT TO THE SECOND PANEL BUT I CAN BRING YOU A BUILDER'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING LITERALLY ON THE GROUND OUT THERE AND THE DIFFICULTIES THERE FACING THAT I THINK HAS A REAL IMPACT ON YOUR A TOPIC TODAY I DO WANT TO ADD IF YOU READ THIS YOU'LL KNOW EVERYTHING ALMOST THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS INCREDIBLE DOCUMENT -- ON THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING DOCUMENT EVERYTHING IN HERE SO IN MY VIEW A HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT OF A AN ACCURATE IN DEPICTING WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUT THERE ON THE GROUND -- THE STAFF IS SUGGESTED SOME SUGGESTED TOPIC TO LIMIT MY COMMENTS TO THAT I WILL NOTE THAT THE OTHER TWO THEMES GOING ON IN CINEMA COUNTY WHERE WE'RE HEADQUARTERED ONE IS THE FORMAL A THEME WE'VE ADOPTED OF US ENORMOUS STRONG LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT I BELIEVE FOR THE PAST YEAR THERE'S A SECOND THEME THAT EXPLAINS IT ALL IT SO NORMA ON CERTAIN WE HAVE FIRE VICTIMS WHO STILL IN GREAT NUMBERS DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD TO REBUILD OR EVEN WANT TO REBUILD THE OF FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS I MIGHT ALSO NOTE ON THE AGENDA IS THE ONLY OTHER THING I MIGHT CORRECT THE THE TITLE OF OUR SESSIONS NOT CORRECT BUT SUPPLEMENT IS REBUILDING AFTER THE FIRE WILL LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON OUT THERE IS IT'S BUILDING AFTER THE FIRE NOT NECESSARILY REBUILDING I'VE TALKED A HUNDRED TO CONTRACTORS -- BUILDING OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE AREA AND LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO LOST A HOME I REPEAT LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY REBUILD THE HOME THAT THEY LOST AND IT'S FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS OLDER FOLKS DON'T WANT TO STORY HOMES ANYMORE THEY WANT ONE STORY HOMES -- THERE OF AS AS THEY SETTLE UP ON INSURANCE ARE FINDING OUT THERE FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME WAS INSURED FOR WHAT WILL REBUILD AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOME THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE GOING TO RETIRE ANYWAY WANTED TO MOVE AWAY WHATEVER AND A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REBUILDING A HOME THAT'S DIFFERENT TO WHAT THEY HAD BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS WANTED THE UPGRADE AN UPDATE THAT HOME SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF REBUILDING AND BUILDING THAT'S GOING ON TOPICS QUICKLY THAT WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS WHAT'S THE BEST PRACTICE TO ESTABLISH REPLACEMENT COSTS OUT WELL IN IN YOUR REPORT HERE REFERS TO US NORMAL ACOSTA WELL THERE'S NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT WHAT WE EXPERIENCE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NORTH BAY FIRES AS I REFER TO THEM OF THE MAGNITUDE HAS THROWN EVERYTHING -- INTO FLOCKS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ON THE INSURANCE SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE CONTRACTOR SIDE WHAT I I MET WITH A BUNCH CONTRACTORS A NUMBER OF THEM IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS TO TRY AND GIVE US A FLAVOR OF WHAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING ONE ASKED THIS IS WITH THEM THIS QUESTION ABOUT ESTABLISHING REPLACEMENT COST THEY SAID THE THE THEY SAID THE ONUS IS REALLY BACK ON THE HOMEOWNER THAT THE THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY MAY HAVE FAILED LOCALLY TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESS BUT IT REALLY GETS BACK TO THE FIRE VICTIM TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK WITH ALL OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM WHAT OTHER CONTRACTORS SAID IS IF YOU HAVE A HOME THAT YOU LOST GO FIND A HOME THAT'S BEING REBUILT SOMEONE IN YOUR SIZE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND FIND OUT WHAT THOSE BUILDING COSTS ARE FROM THE CONTRACTORS DOING THE WORK IT'S ROUGHLY IN COFFEE PARK WHICH LOS THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOMES CHRIS -- TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TO TWO HUNDRED NINETY DOLLARS IS THE REBUILDING PER SQUARE FOOT COSTS THAT MOST OF THE BUILDERS ARE EXPERIENCING UP AND FOUND A GROVE IT RANGES FROM THREE TWENTY FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED ON THE LOW SIDE PER SQUARE FOOT AND SIX TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE ON -- ON THE HIGH SIDE THE MAJORITY OF UNDER INSURED SIR TRYING TO BUILD A CUSTOM HOME AND THAT THAT'S PART OF THE DIFFICULTY IT SO MUCH EASIER DOWN THE COFFEE PARK WITH FLAT LOTS THEN THE THEN THE HILLSIDE LOTS WHAT I WAS TOLD BY THE BUILDERS IS THE HILLSIDE LOTS IN THE COST OF BUILDING THAT GOES INTO THAT CAN ADD ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE COST OF REBUILDING AS OPPOSED TO DOWN IN A FLAT LOT OF PRODUCTION HOMES OR WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COFFEE PARK AREA WITH THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOMES VERY FEW PEOPLE AS I SAID A REBUILDING THE HOME THEY LOST IT IS FAR MORE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE AND THEY CAN GET A GUARANTEED PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT BY HAVING A BUILDER COME IN AND SAY I'VE GOT TWELVE MODELS YOU PICK ONE WILL HANDLE ALL OF CONSTRUCTION IN THE FINISHING NO CHANGE ORDERS AND NEXT TIME WE SEE YOU WILL HAND YOU YOUR KEYS TO THE HOUSE BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY A CONTRACTOR A CAN GIVE A GUARANTEED PRICE IF THEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO A HOMEOWNER SAYING IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROJECT YOU KNOW ON MY BROTHER IN LAW BILLS KITCHEN CABINETS HOW ABOUT HOW ABOUT IF YOU USE HIM THAT DOESN'T WORK I I'D ADD THE PRICE DIFFERENCES THAT I WAS ASKED ABOUT IN AREAS AFFECTED BY THE FIRE -- BOYS I JUST NOTED IT SO THE HILLSIDE HOMES IT WILL TAKE MUCH LONGER TO REBUILD AND HAVE LESS OF A REBUILD IN COFFEE PARK OR A LARGE FIELD THAT -- PRIMARY DRIVER IS THE PROPERTY AND -- WHETHER IT'S FLAT OR HILL SIDE FINALLY I WAS ASKED ABOUT THE -- PRICES SO TO BUILD IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEN IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRE FIRE AND POST FIRE I WAS SURPRISED WHEN THE DOZENS OF CONTRACTORS THAT I TALKED TO SAID THERE'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE BUT I I MEAN BUILDING COSTS THEMSELVES -- ON IN SEPTEMBER FIRST TO OCTOBER IF YOU PRICE THE HOME THE BIGGEST CONSIDERATION AND THE PROBLEM WE'RE FACING IS LABOR COSTS YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY ADD THEY SAID ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COST OF BUILDING FREE FIRE VERSES BUILDING POST FIRE AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DISASTER HAS LED TO COMPETITION FOR LABOR LIKE WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE AND SO IS THAT'S THE THAT MATERIALS A GO UP AND DOWN A LITTLE BIT ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES AND I WILL CLOSE BY SAYING WITH THE THE STATE HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB OVER THE YEARS AND CODE CHANGES FOR SAFETY GREEN BUILDING AT CETERA BUT IT'S ALSO COME WITH A PRICE TAG ONE HOME BUILDER THAT BUILT A HOME IN COFFEE PARK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX ADDED UP ALL IT TOOK THOSE PLANS AND WHAT IT WOULD COST TO BRING THOSE PLANS UP TO CODE TODAY AND IT ADDED JUST OVER A HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS SO I APPRECIATE THE CODE CHANGES AND THE INTENTION OF THEM -- BUT IT DOES COME WITH A PRICE TAG AND HOMEOWNERS GETTING STICKER SHOCK AT WHAT IT COSTS TO BRING A HOME UP TO CODE WHICH IS WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO REBUILD THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME ALL WELCOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER WOODS THAT FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR INSIGHT AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS IN JUST A MOMENT I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR THIRD PANELIST TO SHARE HIS WISDOM CHRIS ROGERS THE VICE MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBER FROM THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA MISTER ROGERS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST MADE WE'RE REALLY EXPERIENCING THIS DISASTER AS A COMMUNITY IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THROUGH IT AS A COMMUNITY I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT LATER FROM -- UNITED POLICY HOLDERS A SURVEY WAS DONE TWO THIRDS OF SANTA ROSEN'S THAT LOST THEIR HOME OR UNDER INSURED BY MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND IF YOU LOOK IN YOUR PACKET OVER HALF OF MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO FIND A NUMBER THAT WORKS WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR INSURANCE TO ACTUALLY START REBUILDING THEIR HOME SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS OF WHY WE HAVEN'T REBUILT MORE IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR ACTUALLY VERY PROUD THAT WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND HOMES AND SANTA ROSA UNDER CONSTRUCTION ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT WAS LOST THAT'S REALLY FAST WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW EXTENSIVE THE DEBRIS CLEANUP WAS AND SOME OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE MET BUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME IS IN GETTING THAT NUMBER FROM THEIR INSURANCE AND I AM HEARING OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM MY CONSTITUENTS IN FOUNTAIN GROW THAT THEY ARE BEING PRESSURED TO SIGN ON THE DOTTED LINE ON AN AGREEMENT BEFORE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO EVEN FIND A CONTRACTOR TO GIVE THEM A BIT FOR REBUILDING THEIR HOME A LOT OF THAT IS AROUND THE EIGHTEEN MONTH EXT MARK THAT THEY HAVE FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE AND THAT IS IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE THING FOR YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT BE AN EXTENSION OF THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AS HAS BEEN SAID WE ARE IN A NEW NORMAL WHERE THE DEVASTATION IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THAT PASSED FIRES WHEN YOU HAVE A FIRE LIKE THIS YOU CREATE ITS OWN ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE RESPONSE IS NOT GOING TO BE THE SAME SO NOT ONLY WAS THE DEBRIS CLEANUP LONGER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BUT WE'VE ALSO NOTICED DIFFERENT QUIRKS IF YOU WILL -- THAT HAVE COME UP FROM THIS WE HAD A WATER SYSTEM UP IN FOUNTAIN GROVE THAT LITERALLY MELTED AND CREATED A BENZENE ISSUE IN THE SOIL THAT PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR REBUILD UP UNTIL WE CLEARED THIS THIS ACTUALLY BEGINNING OF THE MONTH SO TOOK US A YEAR TO CLEAR THE SOIL OF THE BENZENE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO REBUILD SO THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING IN TEMPORARY HOUSING ONLY HAVE SIX MONTHS LEFT AT THIS POINT OF THAT TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE BEFORE THEIR EXPECTED TO BE BACK IN THEIR HOME THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WE HAD JOURNEYS AND A MOBILE HOME PARK WHERE FORTY FOUR OF THE UNITS WERE NOT DESTROYED WERE LARGELY NOT DAMAGED BY THE FIRE BUT THE WATER SYSTEM WAS DESTROYED IN CONTAMINATED THE JOURNEY'S END WHICH MEANS THAT THOSE FORTY FOUR HOMES CANNOT RE OCCUPY THEIR HOME AND THEY ALSO CANNOT BE PAID OUT BY THEIR INSURANCE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CONDEMNED THEY'RE SITTING IN LIMBO THIS EIGHTEEN MONTHS REALLY IS NOT ENOUGH IN ORDER FOR MY CONSTITUENTS TO BEGIN THE RECOVERY PROCESS EVEN MOVING AS QUICKLY AS WE'VE BEEN MOVING AND I WILL TELL YOU -- CITY SANTA ROSA A LOT OF OUR JOB IS BEEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO HAVE PEOPLE MOVE FORWARD ONCE THEY HAVE THEIR PLANS IS SUBMITTED TO THE CITY IT TAKES FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS TO THE PLAN CHECK THE DELAY IS LARGELY NOT ON GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY WHICH I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE PRETTY SURPRISED TO HEAR IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND TRYING TO GET THESE ELEMENTS DONE -- IN A IN A AS I SAID IN A LOT OF WAYS THIS EIGHTEEN MONTH METRIC IS BEING USED TO TRY TO LEVERAGE SETTLEMENTS FASTER FROM MY CONSTITUENTS MANY OF WHOM ARE REPORTING THAT THEY'RE GETTING LOW BALLED AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO OPTIONS BUT TO SIGN ONE THING I WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO DO IS TO REVISIT SOME OF THE INSURANCE BILLS THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THIS COMMITTEE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AGUIAR-CURRY SENATOR MCGUIRE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD THEY ALL BROUGHT FORTH REALLY THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HELP MY CONSTITUENTS AS I SAID EVERY ADDITIONAL DELAY OR EVERY ADDITIONAL COST MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT SANTA ROSEN'S DON'T REBUILD THEIR HOME ONE BILL IN PARTICULAR FROM SENATOR MCGUIRE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO BE PAID OUT FOR THEIR ITEMS IN THEIR HOME THAT WERE DESTROYED WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ITEMIZING EVERY SINGLE ISSUE THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT AND RE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR MY CONSTITUENTS AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE AGGREGATE OF WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO GO THROUGH THE HOOPS THAT THEY HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH IN ORDER TO REBUILD THAT'S THE ONE THAT I HEAR MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO THROW UP THEIR HANDS AND SAY WHAT WAS THE POINT OF HAVING INSURANCE I'D WE REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO REVISIT THOSE BILL THOSE BILLS THE OTHER THING THAT ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO IS LOOK AT SOME OF THE ODD QUIRKS THAT MAKE THEIR WAY INTO INSURANCE -- POLICIES MANY FOLKS AND FOUND GROWTH HAD TOLD ME THAT IN THEIR INSURANCE PLAN WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY REBUILD THEIR HOME WITHIN TEN PERCENT OF ITS ORIGINAL FOOT PRINT AS MR WOOD SAID WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT OR EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT TO REBUILD YOUR HOME SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY IT'S GOING TO PENCIL OUT AS IF YOU BUILD SMALLER AND A LOT OF THESE POLICIES ARE SAYING THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO STILL BE WITHIN TEN PERCENT ON THE BOTTOM AND I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT IS THAT THEY WON'T GO HOG WILD AND BUILD WAY BIGGER THAN THEY HAD IT'S ACTUALLY PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO REBUILD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REBUILD SMALLER FINALLY I WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE REALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF LOOKING AT THIS FROM A HOLISTIC STANDPOINT NOT JUST INSURANCE FOR RECOVERY BUT LOOKING AT THE FEMA PROCESS AS WELL WHAT FEMALE WILL PAY FOR VERSES WHAT INSURANCE WILL PAY FOR WE ARE FINDING WAYS THAT IS CHALLENGING A GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF MANY OF YOUR COMMUNITIES I'M SURE MADE THE MOVE YEARS AGO TO REQUIRE SIDEWALK REPAIRS TO BE DONE BY HOMEOWNERS IT'S BEEN PRETTY STANDARD THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOW THE WAY THAT THIS IS PLAYED OUT IN IN THAT IN A DISASTER IS FOR OUR CITY THOSE SIDEWALKS ARE NOW BEING REPAIRED USING INSURANCE DOLLARS BECAUSE FEMALE WILL NOT COVER THEM BECAUSE FEMA HAS SAID THAT THIS ACTUALLY ON THE ONUS OF THE HOMEOWNER SO PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO DEBRIS REMOVAL OR WE HAVE THESE BIG TRACTORS THAT WERE -- WORKING THEIR WAY ON OUR STREETS AND ON OUR SIDE WALKS AND DOING DAMAGE THAT IS NOT COVERED BY FEMA WHEN YOU LOOK AT DAMAGED TREES FEMALE WILL COVER A TREE IF IT IS FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER SIX FEET TALL AND FROM THE GROUND UP BUT IT WILL NOT COVER THE ROOTS AND IT WILL NOT COVER THE STOP THAT WILL FALL ON INSURANCE FOR THAT WILL FALL ON THE CITY THERE ARE I'D SAY RIDICULOUS EXACT DEFINITIONS THAT ARE HAVING TO BE MET AND IF THE STATE LAWS AND IF FEMA OPERATING PROCEDURES ART COINCIDING WITH ONE ANOTHER IT LEAVES HOMEOWNERS IN LIMBO APPLAUSE THERE AND SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS THIS ROGERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I CAN FEEL FROM YOUR VOICE AND YOUR EMOTIONS THAT YOU'VE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS AND IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITY AND I HAD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT THAT YOU BROUGHT TO US TODAY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO INVITE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL ASSEMBLY AND SENATORS STAFF WITH QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL THE PLEASE WITH SENATOR GALGIANI WELCOME THERE MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR OUR FIRST PANELIST -- YOU MENTIONED THAT HIGH TURNOVER AND ADJUSTERS WHAT IS THE RATIONALE FOR THAT WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE CAUSES THAT HAVE LED TO THAT STAFFING THEY THEY WEREN'T PREPARED DAY BEING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THIS IS THEIR BUSINESS MODEL THIS IS HOW THEY TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT'S HOW THEY STAFF THESE STORMS THEY DON'T KEEP THESE PEOPLE IN PLACE FOR VERY LONG BECAUSE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER STORM IN FLORIDA AND THEY HAVE TO GO THERE SO THEY'RE CONSTANTLY BEING TURNED OVER IT'S HARD IT'S FRANKLY IT'S HARD TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE ADJUSTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THERE VERY LONG YOU KNOW YOU'VE DEVELOPER REPORTER AND AND YOU MAY GET THIS CLAIM SETTLED A LITTLE BIT FASTER BUT AS SOON AS ANOTHER STORM COMES ALONG THEY'RE GONE SO IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE QUITTING THE COMPANY PER SE BUT THE COMPANY IS CHOOSING TO MOVE THEM AROUND BASED ON THE ORDER OF PRIORITIES AT THE TIME I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT AND WORK FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE ONLY CONCLUSION I CAN REACH I MEAN CERTAINLY ANY ANY TIME THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ANY COMPANY -- BUREAUCRACY WHEN THERE'S THERE'S NOT AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THE BASICS AND SOMEBODY GETS SHIFTED AND YOU'RE STARTING THE WHOLE PROCESS ALL OVER IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THAT'S GOING TO EXTEND THE TIME FRAME AND IT'S GOING TO EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM SO YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A CHOICE AS WITH REGARD WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY HERE'S ANOTHER THING ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THAT WE ARE GETTING ADJUSTERS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THEY'RE NOT SAVVY WITH CALIFORNIA LAW SO THEY MAY ADJUST THE CLAIM DIFFERENTLY IN TEXAS IOWA IDAHO BUT WE HAVE VERY SPECIFIC LAWS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT PROTECT OUR OUR INSUREDS AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I HAVE A CLIENT THAT CHOSE TO BUY A NEW HOUSE YOU CAN READ PLACE OR YOU CAN REBUILD PER THE CONTRACT NOW MY CLIENT BOUGHT A HOUSE THAT WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD HAD BEEN REMODELED IN FIFTY YEARS THEY LIVED IN FOUND GROW THEIR HOUSE WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN YOU REPLACE YOUR HOME CONTRACTUALLY YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BUY A HOUSE OF LIKE KIND AND QUALITY IF THE HOUSE THAT YOU BUY IS FIFTY YEARS OLD AND YOUR HOUSE THAT YOU LOST IS TEN YEARS OLD YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO RE MODEL THAT FIFTY YEAR OLD HOME TO BRING IT TO THE STANDARDS OF LIKE KIND AND QUALITY THAT YOU HAD I HAD AN ADJUSTER THAT WAS WORKING OUT OF ILLINOIS AND I SAID WELL MY CLIENT HAS BOUGHT A NEW HOUSE BUT THEY WANT TO REMODEL IT IT'S NOT LIKE KIND AND QUALITY AND THE ANSWER I RECEIVED WAS IF IT HAS A BATHROOM AND KITCHEN THEY HAVE TO MOVE AND AND THAT'S NOT WHAT CALIFORNIA LAW THAT'S NOT WITH THEIR CONTRACTS AS BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE A DOZEN OF CALIFORNIA LAW BE HE'S NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICY SO YOU HAVE TO EDUCATE THESE FOLKS ALONG THE WAY THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR LARA THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MISTER LARSON WHEN IT CAME TO THAT'S BEING USED TO -- THE SOFTWARE THAT THE ADJUSTERS USE YOU MENTIONED THAT AS A AS AN OF AN ISSUE -- FOR PRODUCING AN ACCURATE REPAIR RATES AND ESTIMATES WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER WHAT ARE SOME RECOMMENDS THAT YOU THINK WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING THE ACCURATE THE THAN THE APPROPRIATE RATES YEAH THE THE PROGRAM NAY USES ONES I THINK THAT -- IT BE PRUDENT UPON INSURANCE CARRIERS TO BRING AND FROM THE VERY BEGINNING LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO HELP THEM ESTABLISH THE REPLACEMENT PRICE AND THAT'S OFTEN WHAT THEY DO BUT THE FIRST SALVO IS TO SEND YOU AN EXACT MADE ESTIMATE AND SOME OF THE INSURERS MAY ACCEPT THAT AND JUST SAY WELL I GUESS THIS IS ALL I'M GONNA GET I GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO REBUILD MY HOUSE THE NEXT LEVEL IF YOU COMPLAIN IS FOR THEM TO HIRE A BUILDING CONSOLE BUT THEN TYPICALLY DO THAT FROM THE BEGINNING A PUT TOGETHER THIS EXACTLY MADE ESTIMATE AND THEN THEY PRESENT IT AND SAY WELL HERE'S HERE'S YOUR SETTLEMENT THANK YOU FOR THE THE VICE MAYOR THANK YOU FOR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ARE YOU DID BRING UP AN ISSUE THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATING ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE INSURANCE ISSUE AND ADDRESSING THE FIRES WE TENDED TO THINK OF AS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND NOT REALLY TAKEN TO CONSIDER CONSIDERATION THE HUMAN ELEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC HEALTH THINGS ARE IMPERATIVE NOW THE COORDINATION AMONG AGENCIES ISSUES OUT WHAT THE LOCAL ERROR -- QUALITY BOARD HOW DO WE ADDRESS FOOD SUPPLY ISSUES AND SECURITY -- AND AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECT CAN YOU TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS ON HOW THE COURT IS THERE ANY COORDINATION HOW TO RECORD MADE -- BECAUSE THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU BROUGHT UP NOW THAT OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE ARGUMENTS FOR ME WAS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO REPLACE OUR HOME IMMEDIATELY BUT HOW CAN YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A MASSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE ANOTHER THAT ARISES WHAT ABOUT FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW WILL HAVE -- -- YOU KNOW NOT AS GOOD THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO NOW ADDRESS IN TERMS OF AIR QUALITY THAT REMAINS SO YOUR CAN YOU SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND EXPERIENCES IN TERMS OF THE COORDINATION OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES JUST TO GIVE US SOME MORE PERSPECTIVE ON THAT YEAH I I THINK -- WHEN IT COMES TO CAL -- YES I THINK THEY'VE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB FOR OUR COMMUNITY THEY'VE COME IN AND THEY'VE REALLY TRIED TO HELP US NAVIGATE SOME OF THE FEDERAL RULES AND OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE THERE BUT THERE ARE SO MANY UNKNOWNS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREPARE FOR BOTH IN TERMS OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO END UP COSTING US ON THE BACK AND WE HAVE SPECIFIC CONSULTANTS THAT WE HAVE BROUGHT IN TO DO OUR -- DOCUMENTATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE GET AUDITED BY FEMA THAT WE DON'T END UP HAVING TO GIVE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS BACK BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE STAFF ARE LEARNING AS THEY GO SUCH AS THE SIDEWALK ISSUE WE'RE CURRENTLY IN A PROLONGED BATTLE WITH FEMA OVER CORRECTING FOR PAYING FOR THE SIDEWALKS AND EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR THAT WE HAVE TO PUT TOWARDS THINGS LIKE THAT TAKE AWAY DOLLARS FOR OUR UNMET NEED THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY SANTA ROSA FOR CONTEXT HAD A ONE PERCENT VACANCY RATE BEFORE THE FIRE THAN WHAT WE SAW WAS FOLKS WHO WERE LIVING ON THE MARGINS WERE DISPLACED AUTOMATICALLY IN IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES WHO HAD INSURANCE TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR HOUSING WE'RE WILLING TO PAY FIVE THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND TO TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I'VE HEARD A MONTH FOR RENT IS -- RENTERS WERE DISPLACING -- EXCUSE ME LANDLORDS WERE DISPLACING RENTERS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THOSE ARE THOSE VULNERABLE FOLKS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF ASSISTANCE RUNS OUT THOSE FOLKS ARE ALSO WHO ARE LIVING ON THE MARGINS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND THEIR OWN HOUSING AS WELL IN A MARKET THAT'S TIGHT IN AN AREA THAT'S EXPENSIVE WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY NOT JUST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IF YOU KNOW I HAVE DECIDED TO RELOCATE AS OPPOSED TO REBUILD CAM AND JUST HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO TO REBUILD SO THAT'S A HARD ONE TO TO ANSWER WE ACTUALLY IN OUR MONTHLY MEETINGS WE GET AN UPDATE ON WHICH LOTS OF BEEN SOLD THAT'S AN INDICATION BUT IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T TELL US THE PEOPLE OF RE LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY OR IF THEY'VE GONE ELSEWHERE I KNOW THAT THERE'S PROBABLY SOME DATA THAT'S OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN GET THE WE WERE TOLD TO EXPECT SUMMER BETWEEN A THIRD AND A HALF OF FOLKS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES TO NOT REBUILD IN SANTA ROSA RIGHT NOW I THINK WE'RE ON THE LOW END OF THAT I THINK FOR AROUND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THAT I'VE SEEN WE'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF FOLKS FROM CENTER AS A THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU CENTER LARA ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND BRING US ALL TOGETHER CERTAINLY THIS HAS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CERTAINLY NOTHING THAT WE'VE EVER IMAGINE WE ARE IN UNCHARTED WATERS WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE MODIFIERS THAT WE HAVE -- -- -- OF HAVE OCCURRED -- THUS FAR ONE THINK MY COLLEAGUES ON BECAUSE I KNOW THEY WERE ON THE BATTLEFIELD YOU TRYING TO EVERYTHING THEY CAN LEGISLATIVELY TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND THIS MY QUESTION IS FOR AYE COUNCILMAN OF MAYOR -- ROGERS WHAT CAN BE THREE TAKE AWAY THAT YOU WOULD LIKE FOR US TO CONSIDER WHEN WE RETURN BACK TO SACRAMENTO -- IN JANUARY YEAH I I THINK I MENTIONED ONE OF THEM WHICH IS THAT BETTER COORDINATION OR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FEMALE WILL PAY FOR VERSUS WHAT INSURANCE PAYS FOR HOW TO REBUILD -- THROUGH THAT PROCESS THE OTHER ONE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT REBUILDING BETTER NOT JUST BUILDING BACK TO WHAT WE HAD BUT ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN FACING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN WITH AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OBVIOUSLY HOUSING HAS BEEN TOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO COME BY IN CALIFORNIA EVEN BEFORE THE FIRES IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR SACRAMENTO TO ADDRESS NOT JUST SPENDING DOLLARS TO PUT SOMEBODY IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND TRY TO MOVE THEM FOR THAT WAY WHILE THEY REBUILD THEIR HOME BUT ACTUALLY WE IS A CITY WE FLIPPED OUR OUR BUILDING CODES TO ALLOW EIGHTY USER SECONDARY UNITS TO BE BUILT FIRST ON A PROPERTY IF SOME OF THE INVESTMENT WAS FORWARD LOOKING TO BUILD THOSE SECONDARY UNITS FOR FOLKS TO LIVE IN WHILE THEY'RE REBUILDING THEIR HOMES THEN WE COME OUT OF IT NOT JUST STRONGER BUT WITH ADDITIONAL HOUSING STOCK SO LOOKING AT WAYS TO REBUILD BETTER HELP FOLKS TO HIT THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AS WELL IN THAT REBUILD PROCESS I SHOULD MENTION THERE'S A GOOD PARTNERSHIP CITY SANTA ROSA COUNTY OF CINEMA IT'S THEM A CLEAN POWER THAT ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER AN ENERGY PACKAGE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO REBUILD NET ZERO ENERGY AT NO ADDITIONAL COST IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE NEED TO HELP THE WE NEED TOOLS TO PROVIDE THROUGHOUT OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE THE CCA THAT ALLOWS US TO DO THAT AND THEN THE THIRD ONE AND I I DON'T MEAN TO HARP ON IT TOO MUCH BUT SENSIBLE THINGS LIKE THE ITEM IS ATION ISSUE AROUND CONTENTS REALLY DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S PSYCHES -- GOING FORWARD AND AND TRY TO GET THEM TO REBUILD SELF ACCEPTED THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THESE TO BE LOOKED AT AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON I HAVE CENTER MORLOCK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON AND COOLEY -- NEXT SENATOR MOORE LÀ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER LARSON COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOUR COMPANY IS AND WHAT YOUR JOB IS SURE -- SO MY COMPANY IS A FIRM THAT REPRESENTS THE INSURED'S THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SEND OUT THEIR ADJUSTERS AND THE ADJUSTERS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES REPRESENT THE INSURANCE COMPANY I REPRESENT THE INSURED THROUGH THE CLAIMS PROCESS SO YOU'RE SOMEONE THAT WE WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE HELP THE THE VALUATION OF THEIR BUILDING AND WE HELP THE INSURED WITH NEGOTIATION OF THEIR RELOCATION BENEFITS THEN HOW DO YOU ARE YOU COMPENSATED FOR THOSE SERVICES WE TAKE A FEE WE TAKE A COMMISSION OFF THE TOLL RECOVER THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU AND IT IS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE FIRES WERE VERY VERY DEFICIT DEVASTATING IN A ROW -- HOWEVER IT'S ALSO JUST AS CLEAR THAT THAT DEVASTATION DIDN'T END WHEN WE PUT THE FIRE OUT IT IS CONTINUE TO MANIFESTED THROUGH THE HARDSHIPS THAT PROPERTY OWNERS OF OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW -- MISTER LARSON YOU HAD MENTIONED -- THAT PEOPLE WERE UNAWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THAT THIS WAS WRITTEN -- NUMBER TWO ISSUE -- WERE THERE ANY EFFORTS -- THAT YOU KNOW OF A BROAD BASED THAT THAT WENT OUT TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE AND EDUCATE THEM ON THEIR RIGHTS FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE WHAT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF LITERATURE PUT OUT BY THE STATE LOCAL LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES -- I KNOW THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO TO GO THROUGH THEIR POLICY WITH TO GO THROUGH THE POLICY WITH THE INSURED'S -- BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF THAT OKAY AND THEN ALSO MISTER -- WOULD AS AS FAR AS THE UPDATES AND CODES AND ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW SOMEONE MAY BUY A HOUSE AND FIFTEEN YEARS LATER SOMETHING DEVASTATING HAPPENS AND THEY LOSE THAT HOUSE AND OVER THE TIME CODES HAVE BEEN UPDATING ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY EFFORTS THAT ARE MADE BY INSURANCE COMPANIES TO REACH OUT TO THEIR -- CLIENTS ARE TO PROPERTY OWNERS THAT THE INSURER TO HELP THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT A CODE UPDATE MAY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BECOME UNDER INSURED INTERESTING QUESTION AT ALL LEAVE TO THE NOT HEARD OF A LOT OF THAT HOMEOWNERS SAY LOOK THE LESSON OUT OF -- THE DISASTROUS GO REVIEW YOUR POLICY THOSE OF YOU WHO STILL HAVE A HOMES OF OF FIRE RISK ALL OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE LEARNED IS A FIRE AT FIRE RISK SO EVERYBODY ON LOOK AT THEIR POLICY NOW UNDERSTAND THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE CODE CHANGES ARE BUILT INTO THIS INTO A REBUILD IN INSURANCE POLICIES BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT IF IT'S NOT IN THERE OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING STICKER SHOCK IN A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT THIS IS LEADING THE LIST IS -- YOU CAN LOOK AT FIFTY TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE FOR AN AVERAGE HOME BEFORE YOU EVEN PUT A SHOVEL IN THE GROUND AND I'M NOT ARGUING AGAINST THE CODES THAT THESE FOR ALL -- THEY MADE SENSE AND IT'S JUST THE ACCUMULATION OF THEM OVER THE YEARS HAS ADDED A HECK OF A A BIG COST TO THE BUILDING OR REBUILDING MY HOME I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND THEN BACK TO MISTER LARSON I HEARD YOU ANSWER -- -- SENATOR MORLOCKS QUESTION ABOUT -- THE COMPANY AND WHAT YOU DO HOW YOU'RE COMPENSATED BUT HOWARD HOW ARE YOUR SERVICES -- RETAINED WELL IT'S EITHER THROUGH REFERRAL -- WE MARKET -- SANDERS SO WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS OR DISASTER YOU MOVE INTO THAT AREA AND THEN YOU KIND OF LIKE IT THE AREA WITH MARKETING MARKETING YEAH I THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY I JUST WANTED TO JUMP IN AND OFFER A COMMENT ABOUT THIS WHOLE PROCESS ON ONE OF THE DISTINCTIVE THINGS ABOUT THIS TYPE OF FIRE IS THE LOSS OF FOUNDATIONS TO HOMES AND ANYBODY WHO'S IN A HILLSIDE LOCATION WITH AN OLDER HOME LIKELIHOOD OF NEEDING A NEW FOUNDATION IS GOING TO BE NEW SEISMIC STANDARDS SO THERE'S A CROSSOVER OF THE EARTHQUAKE RISK WHEN YOU HAVE A HOME ON A HILLSIDE LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY GOING TO JUMP YOUR COSTS ANOTHER FACTOR TO KIND OF LOOK AT ON AND THE CONTRAST IS IF YOU HAVE A NICER HOME FIRE FIRE TRUCKS ROLL UP THEY KNOCKED DOWN THE FIRE THE COOL DOWN THE SITE THIS TYPE OF MASS LOSS THE ACTUALLY JUST COLLAPSE IN UPON THE STRUCTURE ITSELF IT CAN JUST STAY HOT FOR DAY AND A HALF AND AN INTENSE HEAT IS WHAT DESTROYS THE FOUNDATION SO THAT'S A PART OF THIS EXPERIENCE OF THESE VERY INTENSIVE LOSSES JUST SCALING THROUGH THE ROOF NEIGHBORHOODS WERE NOT HILLSIDE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT SOME MORE AND THAT SPILLS OVER I THINK FOR US AS MEMBERS SITTING HERE I JUST WANT TO SAY I'VE SENT TO A LOT OF THESE HEARINGS IN MY CAREER AND I THINK THE THING THAT I WOULD SAY JUST FOR US AS COLLEAGUES TO FOCUS UPON CALIFORNIA LAW DOES REGULATE CLAIMS PRACTICES THERE'S AN UNFAIR PLANS PRACTICES ACT AND THIS ISSUE OF CHANGING ADJUSTERS I THINK YOU COULD FORM AN OPINION RUNS AFOUL OF THAT ACT BECAUSE THE KEY OPERATIVE STANDARDS ONION FOR CLAIM PROCESS THAT'S THE LAW THAT WE'VE ADOPTED IS KNOWINGLY COMMITTING OR PERFORMING WITH SUCH FREQUENCY AS TO INDICATE A GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING ON UNFAIR CLAIMS SETTLEMENT PRANK SO YOU COULD SORT OF AS YOU SHOULD ARE YOU LESS OKAY OUR CARRIERS PERFORMING A CERTAIN TYPE OF ACTIVE SUCH FREQUENCY AS INDICATED GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICE SOME OF THE TESTIMONY KIND OF ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE WHAT IS THE KEY RULE FAILING TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT REASONABLE STANDARDS FOR THE PROMPT INVESTIGATION PROCESSING OF CLAIMS ARISE INNER INSURANCE POLICIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE TURNOVER VÀ GESTURES THERE IS A QUESTION OF IS THAT ACTUALLY A FAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE WHEN EACH TIME THE NEW ADJUSTER THAT NEW CONVERSATION FOR THE INSURED BECOMES LIKE PULLING THE SCAB OFF THE WOUND AGAIN JUST CONTINUALLY HAVE YOU KNOW SORT OF A GROUNDHOG DAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A CATASTROPHIC PLAN THIS IS NOT GOOD AND I THIN SO I WOULD JUST SAY AS WE SIT AND LISTEN TO THIS HEARING THAT'S A KEY TAKEAWAY FORCES MEMBERS WERE NOT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WE CAN ASK OURSELVES ARE WE HEARING ABOUT REPETITIVE PRACTICES SEEM TO BE A GENERAL BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES JUST SEEM TO US IS PERHAPS UNFAIR AND WE HAVE ENOUGH LAW ON THE BOOKS ALREADY TO KIND OF ASK QUESTIONS IN THAT DIRECTION AND URGE CHANGE IN ORDER TO MEET THE LAW ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I COULD JUMP IN MP BACK ON YOUR COMMENT TO REALLY FAST ABOUT THE THE FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE I'M REALLY TRYING TO GIVE THIS COMMITTEE REAL EXAMPLES OF WHAT SANTA RESINS ARE GOING THROUGH IN CINEMA COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE GOING THROUGH IN THE DEBRIS CLEANUP PROCESS THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE FOUNDATIONS INTACT WERE POSSIBLE UNTIL THE DRIVEWAYS INTACT FOR POSSIBLE OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO SHIFT SOME OF THE COSTS -- AWAY FROM REBUILDING A HOME WHAT HAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF HOMES COUPLE HUNDRED THAT ARE CURRENTLY WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH A RENT A RESOLUTION PROCESS BECAUSE THEY WERE OVER EXCAVATED OR MORE WAS TAKEN THEN SHOULD HAVE WE'VE HEARD SOME REALLY HORROR STORIES OF PEOPLES -- SWIMMING POOLS BEING TAKEN THEIR DRIVEWAYS BEING TAKEN WHEN THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE BECAUSE AT THE TIME PERHAPS FEMALE WAS PAYING PART TIME AND NOT PER A LOT IT'S SO MY CONSTITUENTS ARE REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES WHEN THEY STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE THAT OVER EXCAVATION ISSUED YET IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THANK THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES -- I DID A FINAL QUESTION MISTER WOODS -- YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT LABOR COSTS GOING UP TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AT AND UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE DEMANDS ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO ABOUT THAT BUT MAY NOT BE IN YOUR PURVIEW BUT A DOTTED LINE OUT FROM -- THIS PANEL OUGHT TO BE TO SUPPORT ANY AND ALL C. T. E. PROGRAMS A TRAINING UNION OR NONUNION WE NEED WORKERS AND -- THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME THAT SERIOUS IT'S A SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND LABOR -- I HAVE -- TWENTY CONTRACTORS WHO TOLD ME THAT WHEN THEY LEAVE A JOB SITE FRIDAY AFTERNOON THEY'RE NOT SURE THOSE SAME WORKERS WILL BE BACK MONDAY MORNING BECAUSE OF BOTH OUT OF STATE CONTRACTORS AND LESS SCRUPULOUS ONES ARE FOLLOWING EMPLOYEES AS THEY LEAVE A JOB SITE SAYING HOW MUCH YOU MAKE AN HOUR I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE OR TEN BUCKS AN HOUR MORE -- AND -- THAT'S PRETTY ATTRACTED TO SOMEBODY SO THIS LABOR SHORTAGES GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE REBUILDING PROCESS WHICH THE VICE MAYOR -- TALKED ABOUT HOW MANY HOMES ARE UNDER WAY WELL THE NUMBERS IMPRESSIVE TO WE LOOK AT THE AGGREGATE AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS -- I'VE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING A THREE TO FIVE YEAR BUILDING PROCESS AND REBUILDING AT MINIMUM AND MORE LIKELY A DECADE BEFORE THE NORTH BAY LOOKS ANYTHING LIKE IT USED TO AND THE HEART OF THAT WILL BE SHORTAGE OF LABOR THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO CONCLUDE THIS PANEL BY THANKING EACH OF YOU FOR COMING AND BRINGING YOUR INSIGHTS CAM I HEARD YOU CLEARLY TALK ABOUT THE CHANGING ADJUSTERS THE LONG ATION OF THE PROCESS -- THAT A LACK OF CLARITY ON RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRACT AND THE NATIONAL EVALUATION TOOLS AND THE PROBLEMS THAT WE WE COME THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT MISTER WOULD APPRECIATE THE ON THE GROUND -- WISDOM THAT YOU BRING NOT JUST ON BUILDING COST SEEMINGLY SIMILAR BUT LABOR COSTS ESCALATING AND CERTAINLY IN THE COST THAT THEY BRING AS I IMPORTANT DATA POINT EVEN IF IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE WANTS TO THANK YOU FOR THAT -- AND AND VICE MAYOR I I THINK THAT THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT YOU'RE YOU AND YOUR COMMUNITY FEEL ON THIS -- HARDER THAN ANYONE WITH GOOD REASON AND -- THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED ABOUT THE EIGHTEEN MONTH TIME LIMIT -- THE ITEM IS ATION REQUIREMENTS THE CLEARING SETTLEMENTS -- ALL VERY RELEVANT THE FEMA VERSES INSURANCE IN WHO PAYS ALL VERY IMPORTANT AND I HOW WE COULD REBUILD BETTER STARTING WITH SECOND UNITS IS AS A GREAT PEARL OF WISDOM THAT I HOPE AND I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING YOUR THOUGHTS AND ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE PANEL NUMBER TWO INTRODUCED THEM TO YOU BUT THE SECOND PANEL -- IS GONNA FOCUS ON UNDER INSURANCE PARTICULARLY WHEN NUMEROUS HOMES ARE LOST AT THE SAME TIME AND THE COST TO REBUILD SKYROCKET -- THESE THIS CREATES A BIG A BIG PROBLEM THE INSURANCE TO VALUE REPRESENTS A RATIO OF INSURANCE COVERAGE TO THE ACTUAL COST TO REBUILD -- WHEN IT'S TOO LOW WITH THE HOME IS UNDER INSURED AND HOMEOWNERS WON'T HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE TO REBUILD THE HOUSE SO PROVIDING INSIGHT ON THESE ISSUES -- THIS MORNING WE HAVE WITH US -- AMY BACH ROB DARE IF I'M PRONOUNCING THAT RIGHT JAR -- LLOYD DIXON AND REX FRAZIER AMY BACH IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNITED POLICY HOLDERS A UNITED POLICY HOLDERS IN ADVOCACY AND ASSISTANCE ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS DIRECTLY WITH HOMEOWNERS OUT ROB IS A PARTNER OF GEORGE PETERSON INSURANCE AGENCY IN SANTA ROSA HE'S A PARTNER AT THE AGENCY I'LL DISCUSSES CLIENTS EXPERIENCES WITH THE RECENT FIRES AND WHAT HIS AGENCY DOES TO SUGGEST APPROPRIATE COVERAGE LEVELS MISTER DIXON IS DIRECTOR OF THE RAND CENTER FOR CATASTROPHIC RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPENSATION A DOCTOR DIXON WILL PRESENT FINDINGS FROM CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT WHILE THE STUDY DOES NOT DOES -- DOES LOOK AT FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IT ASSESSES CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET TRENDS IN A HIGH RISK FIRE AREA IN THE SIERRA NEVADAS AND FINALLY -- REX FRAZIER AYE HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REFER TO IT AS PATH REPRESENTS THE LARGEST INSURERS IN THE STATE AND FOCUSES ON PERSONAL AUTO AND HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE WE'LL START WITH AMY MISBACH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE GOOD MORNING AND AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION BE OF SERVICE I FEEL LIKE I'M AMONG MANY LONG TIME COLLEAGUES HERE AND AND THE UNITED HOUSE SOLDIERS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT AWARE THREE NON PROFIT WE STARTED A RIGHT ACTUALLY BEFORE THE OAKLAND BERKELEY FIRE NINETY ONE -- SO OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE IN A -- CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE WAS THAT ONE WHICH AT THE TIME WAS OF COURSE THE RECORD BREAKER SINCE THAT TIME AND WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF OTHERS BUT AND THIS IS THE OUR ORGANIZATION RUNS THREE PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO YOUR INQUIRE YOU TODAY A ONE IS CALLED THE ROADMAP TO PREPAREDNESS WERE GIVING PEOPLE BUYING TIPS AND GUIDANCE AND BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE ROADMAP TO RECOVERY WHERE WE GO IN AFTER THERE'S BEEN A DISASTER AND WE OFFER OF A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL EVENTS IN PARTNERSHIP GENERALLY WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS -- AND WE WE GIVE PEOPLE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO COLLECT THE BENEFITS OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE -- AND THEN A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS FOR TROUBLE SHOOTING IN OVERCOMING OBSTACLES AND WE TAKE THE LESSONS WE LEARNED THERE ARE WE FEED THAT INTO THE ROAD MAP TO PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM AND TO AGAIN TO TRY TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO AVOID SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT DISASTER SURVIVORS HAVE HAD WITH NOT HAVING ENOUGH INSURANCE NOT HAVING RECORDS ALL THAT SORT OF THING SO THEN THE THIRD PROGRAM IS THE ADVOCACY INACTION AND THAT'S WHERE WE WORK WITH -- ELECTED OFFICIALS LIKE YOURSELVES TO TRY TO COME UP WITH STRATEGIC WAYS EITHER THROUGH LEGISLATION OR OTHER MEANS OF OF TRYING TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS BUT I'M HERE TO TO TO SAY SADLY -- THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVEN'T MADE A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRESS AND A IN ON SOME LEVELS AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T LAWS THERE ARE GOOD STRONG LAWS IS AND AS KEN COOLEY POINTED OUT WE DO HAVE UNFAIR CLAIMS PRACTICES IN THE CODE WE'VE GOT THE FARE CLAIMS HANDLING REGULATIONS WE'VE GOT THE AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS -- AND AND SO IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARILY AN ISSUE OF NEEDING TO PASS MORE LAWS IT MORE ON WE'VE GOT TO ENFORCE THE ONES WE'VE GOT AND I THINK WE'VE REALLY GOT TO HAVE A LOT MORE COOPERATION FROM THE INDUSTRY FOR FOR THEIR OWN FOR THEIR OWN GOOD AND SO I I JUST WANT TO REVIEW A COUPLE OF QUICK ISSUES THE THE UNDER INSURANCE PROBLEM THE GAPS THE ADJUSTING ISSUES YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THEM WITH THE PRIOR PANEL -- WHAT LAWS WE ALREADY HAVE ON THE BOOKS AND THEN OF COURSE WE YOU PASSED A NUMBER OF NEW ONES THIS SESSION AND THEN JUST THE MARKET PLACE -- I THINK ULTIMATELY -- I WOULD IMAGINE YOUR REAL GOAL HERE IS OKAY LET'S DO THIS BETTER NEXT TIME AND WHAT WE WHAT WE GOT COME IN -- I THINK THERE'S JUST A GENERAL FEELING OUT THERE THAT AND YES THIS WAS AN AWFUL THIS IS AN AWFUL WILDFIRE SEASON TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I AM WE ALL ARE HAPPY TO SEE IT IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THOUGH NOT THAT MUCH BETTER SO KNOWING THAT -- AND KNOWING HOW THAT THAT THAT THE WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR MARKETPLACE WE HAVE PRIVATE COMPETITIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE BRAND NAMES YOU ALL RECOGNIZE WE'VE GOT THE SURPLUS LINES LESS REGULATED COMPANIES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HEARING A LOT MORE ABOUT SINCE THEY'RE PICKING UP PORTIONS OF THE MARKET THAT THE BRAND NAMES ARE LEAVING AND THEN YOU HAVE ARE CLAUSE I GOVERNMENT -- FALL BACKS WE GOT THE FAIR PLAN AND AND THE CA SO THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE FOUR MAIN AREAS AND I KNOW YOU WANT ME TO KEEP MY REMARKS PRETTY SHORT SO I'LL JUST RECAP AND THE YOU GOT THE SURVEY RESULTS -- YOU SLATE AND PUT THOSE IN YOUR IN YOUR MEANING MATERIALS OUR ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE FIRES WERE FULLY CONTAINED OUT LISTEN TODD'S WE WERE WE HAD A TABLE WITH THE DEPART OF INSURANCE AND CINEMA COUNTY BUILDING OUT THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTER WHICH ONCE IT BECAME FEDERAL IT BECAME A DRC SO MY ORGANIZATION WAS THERE WE HAD VOLUNTEERS WHO CAME IN FROM WILD ARE AREAS TO GIVE PEOPLE -- JUST A A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOULDER TO CRY ON AND THEN OUR ORGANIZATION PUTS OUT VERY BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT AND AND OUT WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE AND HOW TO AVOID PROBLEMS ROTATING ADJUSTERS HAS BEEN A CHRONIC PROBLEM LEGISLATURE ALREADY TOOK A CRACK AT IT WITH REQUIRING THAT IF THE COMPANY CHANGES ADJUSTERS MORE THAN I THINK IT'S LIKE MORE THAN THREE -- IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD YOU HAVE TO GET A STATUS REPORT SO THERE THE BUT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT YOU GUYS DID BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK IT'S GETTING CARRIED OUT IN REAL LIFE AND THE SAME THING WITH -- WITH SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN A COPY OF THEIR POLICY WITHIN THIRTY DAYS AND THAT'S IT SOUNDS BASIC BUT AGAIN THESE THINGS ARE NOT HAPPENING THE WAY THEY SHOULD THE POLICY HOLDER THERE'S JUST A MASS AMOUNT OF MISINFORMATION CONFUSION OUT THERE AND I KNOW WE CAN IMPROVE THAT BY CONTINUING TO DO MORE COLLABORATION DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC COLLABORATOR WITH OUR AGENCY AND SO HAS THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA THEY'VE BEEN PARTNERING EVERY TIME WE DO A WORKSHOP WE'VE DONE WELL OVER EIGHTEEN OF THEM AT THE SAME PLACE -- IN DOWNTOWN SANTA ROSA WE'VE DONE THREE IN NAPA AND EVERY TIME WE DEAL -- PUBLIC OFFICIALS PARTICIPATE -- SENATOR DODD'S AID WAS AT OUR ONE OF OUR RECENT ONES ON THE DEAL WHY HAS SENT A REPRESENTATIVE TO ALMOST EVERYONE SO I THINK WE HAVE A NICE WE CALL IT THE ROADMAP TO RECOVERY WE DON'T ENGAGE INSURERS AS MUCH AS MAYBE WE COULD -- BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION I DID TRY TO CONVENE A MEETING WITH -- AS MANY ENSURE REPS AS I KNEW FROM MY MANY YEARS OF BEING A CONSUMER ADVOCATE ON INSURANCE UP THERE -- AND YOUR STAFF MEMBERS TO SORT OF SAY OKAY -- INSURERS LET'S SEE IF WE CAN YOU KNOW KEEP YOU OUT OF THE PAPERS A LITTLE BIT HERE AND GET YOUR CUSTOMERS A LITTLE BIT -- HAPPIER AND NOT HAVE THE SAME FIGHTS THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE WITH YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE TO REQUIRE THE SOCIALIZATION WHEN EVERYTHING IS GONE -- REALLY YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE HAVE TO ROTATE ADJUSTERS WITHOUT CONTINUITY YOU KNOW COULD YOU COULD WE FIX THESE THINGS A BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T GET VERY FAR IN OUR LITTLE MEETING AND -- SO NOW JUST TO BRING IT BACK TO THE END OF MY REMARKS AS I AM LOOKING FOR TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS -- CLEARLY -- THAT THERE ARE MAJOR GAPS HERE IN PEOPLE'S IN PEOPLE'S COVERAGE AND YOU'VE BEEN HEARING AGAIN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE LEGISLATURE HAS LOOKED AT THE ESTIMATING TOOLS THAT INSURERS ARE USING AT THE POINT OF SALE THERE WAS A HEARING AFTER THE SAN DIEGO WILD FIRES WHERE THE EXECUTIVES FROM MARSHALL'S WITH BACK WERE BROUGHT IN TO SAY HOW COME YOU GUYS ARE GETTING ALONG WHAT'S GOING ON HERE SO AGAIN WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO YOUR THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A NUMBER OF DISCLOSURE BILLS YOU'VE DONE A NUMBER OF OF BILLS TO TRY TO GET THE CONSUMER MORE AWARE TO PAY ATTENTION THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN DIFFERENT KIND OF POLICIES BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T SOLVED IS THE FACT THAT THE CONSUMER REALIZE AT THE POINT OF SALE ON THE PROFESSIONALS THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT INSURANCE THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT REAL STATE OTHER THAN MAYBE WHAT THEY PAID FOR THEIR HOUSE MAYBE THEY KNOW HOW MUCH SQUARE FOOTAGE THEY HAVE ZERO IDEA ABOUT WHAT THEIR INSURANCE NEEDS ARE AND THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT AN INSURANCE AGENT BROKER PROFESSIONAL THAT'S WHAT THEY GET THEIR COMMISSION FOR THEY DON'T GET A COMMISSION JUST FROM PASSING THE PAYMENT YOU KNOW FROM THE CONSUMER TO THE TO THE COMPANY THEY DO HAVE A ROLE THAT SAID THEY ARE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF DISCRETION IN TERMS OF WHAT NUMBER THEY PUT THEY ARE GIVEN A SOFTWARE PROGRAM TO USED TO GENERATE A QUOTE AND THEY DO THAT SO IT'S NOT I'M NOT IS INTERESTED IN POINTING FINGERS OF BLAME AS I AM AT FINDING SOLUTIONS BUT I WILL TELL YOU I THINK IN GENERAL THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- DON'T THEY'RE JUST NOT USED TO THESE THIS MANY TOTAL LOSSES AT ONCE IT IT REALLY TO BE COLLOQUIAL IT FREAKS THEM OUT COMPLETELY THEY DON'T LIKE TO BEND THE RULES THEY TREAT THESE CLAIMS VERY MUCH LIKE THE CREEK TREAT ALL THEIR CLAIMS THEY ARE NOT USED TO THIS KIND OF ORGANIZE PUSH BACK FROM THEIR CLIENTS A MASS DISASTER IT WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER SO I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- WITH THAT GOAL IN MIND THANK YOU MISS FLOCK AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING YEAR MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND WISDOM AND INSIGHT TO OUR PANEL TODAY AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE QUESTIONS IN JUST A COUPLE MINUTES -- MISTER DARE I PRONOUNCING THAT RIGHT IT'S A THEIR PARTNER IN AN INSURANCE AGENCY YOU'RE SELLING POLICIES TALKING THROUGH WITH CONSUMERS WHAT THEY'RE GETTING ON WITH THEY'RE NOT GETTING OBVIOUSLY USING THE SAME THING THAT -- WE HAVE SEEN HERE AND YOU'VE EXPERIENCE WHICH IS A BIG CHALLENGE WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH A MASSIVE CATASTROPHE THAT WE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT THE INSIDE YOU BRING FROM ALL OF THAT WELL A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON OUR AGENCY JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE -- WE HAD -- NINETEEN HUNDRED CLAIMS AT THE PEAK LAST OCTOBER NOVEMBER -- OF THOSE CLAIMS -- TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR WERE TOTAL HOME LOSSES SO -- YEAH THAT'S IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF OUR FRIENDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE PLACE IN OUR KIDS PLAY SOCCER TOGETHER BUSINESS OWNERS TO INSURE SO VERY VERY PERSONAL SITUATION FOR US IN OUR IN OUR EMPLOYEES THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN WHAT WE'VE WE'VE GOT JUST UNDER US SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND FIRE CLAIMS NOW SO TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STAFF TO DEAL WITH THIS IT'S JUST BEEN ARE ARE THE EMPLOYEES WE'VE GOT -- WE'VE GOT EIGHTY EIGHTY TWO EMPLOYEES IN SANTA ROSA HAVE ALL JUST BEEN STEPPING UP AND AND WORKING HARD TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CLIENTS TO POLICY HOLDERS -- AND IN FRONT I WANT TO MAKE MAKE CLEAR THERE'S THERE'S TWO SIDES OF DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE AGENCY PLAN YOU KNOW WE ARE WHAT'S CALLED AN INDEPENDENT AGENT SO WE'RE BROKERS WE REPRESENT MULTIPLE INSURANCE COMPANIES DID DISTRIBUTION IS IS THE DIRECT WRITER SO THAT'S THE FARMERS THE STATE FARM -- ALL STATE TRIPLE A SO -- YOU I'M HERE TO REPRESENT -- YOU KNOW THE INDEPENDENT AGENCY SIDE SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU KNOW HOW WE DO THINGS WITH OUR AGENCY WE TALKED TO A HOMEOWNER -- UP TO TEN SOMEBODY WHO'S BUYING A HOME OR SOMEBODY OWNS A HOME AND THEY WANT TO TALK TO US ABOUT POTENTIALLY MOVING THEIR INSURANCE TO US -- YOU KNOW WHAT OUR AGENTS DO THEY TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW -- IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO ON THE LOW AND SEE FIFTY EIGHTY PICTURES OF THE HOUSE TO GET A REAL IDEA OF WHAT WHAT THAT HOUSES -- IS ALL ABOUT -- BUT BUT WE TALK TO THEM -- YOU KNOW IF IT'S AN EXISTING HOME OR WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT SORT OF UPGRADES THEY'VE MADE HAVE BEEN HAVE THERE BEEN ADDITIONS THAT THEY MADE TO THE HOUSE AND THEN WE'VE GOT STANDARDS IS AS AN AGENCY THAT WE -- HOUSE FOR A COST PER SQUARE FOOT -- YOU KNOW HOST WE WERE INSURING ANYTHING FOR UNDER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT ANYONE SANTA ROSA -- -- CERTAIN AREAS OF SANTA ROSA WE WE WOULD BE INSURING HOUSES FOR THREE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A FOOT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT -- AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE WOULD ADD -- EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE COVERAGE THE DATE WE CAN PROVIDE TO OUR CLIENTS REALLY FIFTY PERCENT ADDITIONAL SO IF YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING INSURED FOR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT IT'LL GIVE YOU THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT LEVEL -- WE'VE GOT MANY OF OUR CLIENTS -- WITH A HUNDRED PERCENT EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST SO -- A LOT OF THE HOMES THAT WE LOST OUR CLIENTS LOST IN IN SANTA ROSA WERE INSURED FOR YOU KNOW FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT WITH FIFTY PERCENT ON TOP OF THAT CLIENT LEARNING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEN THE NEXT STEP FOR US IS TO TO RUN THIS FAX ON THE HOUSE THROUGH A REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATOR THAT THE INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE SO WE'LL GO OUT THE MULTIPLE CARRIERS AND THAT MODEL THAT THEY HAVE TO TO GET AN IDEA OF WHERE THEY THINK THOSE MODELS THINK THE PRICE SHOULD BE ARE IN SOME INSTANCES -- THEY COME IN -- EARLY -- WHERE WHAT WHAT WE FEEL WHERE THEY SHOULD BE -- IN SOME CASES WE WE FEEL THERE LOW AND -- WILL WILL GO BACK TO THE -- CLIENT TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHERE WE THINK IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE GULF NEGOTIATE THAT HIGHER VALUE -- WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY -- SO SO THAT'S KIND OF THE PROCESS THAT WE WE DO -- YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY AS GOOD AS TO THE THE THE EARLIER PANEL IS THE IS THE THAN THE NUMBERS THEY HAVE PLUGGED INTO THOSE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS BUT -- YEAH WE HAVE ONE OF OUR OUR CARES RIGHT A LOT OF BUSINESS WITH -- POST FIRE THEY WITHIN THREE WEEKS OF OF OF THE FIRES LAST YEAR STANDARD THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT IN THEIR REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATOR BECAUSE THEY SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING -- WITH THE REPLACEMENT COST AND AND THE THE DEMAND SEARCH COMING SO THIS YEAR IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT AT LEAST A FOR YOUR AGENCY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AT THAT BEEN AFFECTED THAT THAT YOU'VE COVERED THAT THEY SEEM TO BE SATISFIED THEN THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE ARE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE MONEY THAT THEY THINK THEY NEED TO REBUILD AND IS THAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FOR US IN PARTICULAR YES WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT ABOUT A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE THAT -- WE THINK THERE MIGHT BE A SITUATION OF UNDER INSURANCE -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THAT E. ME ALTERNATELY YOU KNOW THE THE WHAT TO ENSURE THE HOUSE FOR IS THE IS THE HOMEOWNERS RESPONSIBILITY BUT THEY NEED HELP FROM YOU KNOW OFFICES AS PROFESSIONALS TO TO -- TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT'S GOING TO COST SO -- YOU KNOW I THINK YOU TO HEAR THAT YOU KNOW THAT I I HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME IN SANTA ROSA HOW MANY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE UNDER INSURED AND -- YOU KNOW PART OF THAT I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE BUYERS PARTS OF IT SOMEBODY BY THEIR FIRST HOME -- IF IF IF THEY'VE GOT YOU KNOW EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS THE BUDGET FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND WE'RE PROPOSING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE ELEVEN HUNDRED AND THEY'RE GONNA PUSH BACK -- TO TRY TO GET IT CLOSER TO WHERE WHAT THEY'VE GOT AVAILABLE TO TO PAY SO -- BUT BUT IT AND THEN WE'VE WE'VE SEEN WE RUN INTO AGENTS THAT WILL -- YOU KNOW IF WE CAN THE THE REPLACEMENT COST OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON THE HOUSE -- THEY MAY ENSURE FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND AND TRY TO CONVINCE THIS HOMEOWNER TO ENSURE FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND THEN I'LL PUT SOME EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST TO GET TO THAT FIVE HUNDRED -- AND THAT'S GOING TO SAVE THEM NOT A LOT OF MONEY BUT IT'S GOING TO SAVE SOME MONEY -- BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A DISASTER ON THE SCALE THAT WE HAD HERE -- AND YOU GET THAT DEMAND SURGEON PRICING -- THAT DOESN'T HOLD UP SO WHEN WHEN NOW AT AS AN INDEPENDENT AGENT ARE YOU IN BETWEEN THE INSURED AND THE ENGINE INSURANCE COMPANIES AFTER YOU'VE SOLD THAT POLICY YEAH SO SO THAT'S I THINK ANOTHER -- -- POINT IT'S KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE INSURANCE ADJUSTERS IN THE CARRIERS BE AN OVERWHELMING THE ADJUSTERS BEING OVERWHELMED SINGLE DAY I MEAN YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR HOMEOWNERS AGENTS ALL OF OUR COMMERCIAL AGENTS WHO HAVE FIRES IN THESE CLAIMS WERE TALKING TO THESE AGENTS ARE THESE ADJUSTERS YOU KNOW ON A DAILY OR WEEKLY BASIS -- ME PERSONALLY I'VE GOT A DOZEN HOMES WHERE I'M INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH THE ADJUSTERS BECAUSE -- THEY'RE OVERWHELMED THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THINGS THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT A MORE THE WAY THAT WE SEE THE CONTRACT WORK SELF SO -- YOU KNOW IN OUR CASE WE ARE THAT ADVOCATE IN THE GO BETWEEN BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE POLICY HOLDEN AND WHAT'S AND SO WE'VE HEARD IN THE EARLIER PANEL SIMS EXAMPLES OF WHERE THEY THINK THE PROBLEMS ARE BUT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS -- THE THE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE EXPERIENCE IS JUST THE LAYS WITH COMMUNICATION -- AND THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE -- ALL ALL ALL USE NATIONWIDE FOR EXAMPLE -- WE WE HIT THOSE GUYS VERY VERY HARD A WE HAD A LOT OF LOT OF CLAIMS WITH THEM -- VIA THERE THEY'VE GOT YOU KNOW WELL OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN IN EXPOSURE JUSTIN IN THIS THESE NORTH BAY FIRES AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE PEOPLE TO -- TO ADJUST THESE CLAIMS I MEAN THERE THERE'S -- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE I WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF THERE POLLUTION SEVEN EIGHT HUNDRED TOTAL LOSS CLAIMS AND -- YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT A -- PERSONAL PROPERTY ADJUSTER YOU'VE GOT A -- DWELLING ADJUSTER -- FOR PEOPLE THAT HAD CARS BURN THEY'VE GOT A -- AN AUTO ADJUSTER SO IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE OF RIGHT AFTER THESE FIRES -- YOU HAD WITH THREE ADJUSTERS FOR THREE SPECIFIC LINES OF COVERAGE AND -- -- I I WHAT I SAW AS A I'M A LOT OF BURN OUT I MEAN TALKED ABOUT I THINK A LOT OF THESE THE CARE IS JUST MOVING THESE ADJUSTERS OUT WHAT I SEE MORE IS MORE TURNOVER WITH ADJUSTERS WHERE THEY'RE JUST -- THEY'RE BURNING OUT AND THEY'RE JUST SAYING THIS ISN'T JUST A WAR SUPPORT THE PAYCHECK I'M GETTING SO IN ADDITION TO THE ADJUSTER ISSUE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'VE -- AT THE WOULD HIGHLIGHT AS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AND WILLING CLAIMS -- NOT YET -- BUT IT BUT -- TO VICE MAYORS ROGER -- ROGERS POINT YOU KNOW HE HE KEPT REFERENCING THAT EIGHTEEN MONTH IN THE IN THE POLICY CLAUSE FOR THE ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES I'M NOT SURE WHO'S POLICY THOSE ARE BUT MOST OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE -- HAVE TWO YEARS AND THEN -- SOME OF THEM HAVE EXPENSE BUT BUT -- TO TO HIS POINT EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS ENOUGH TO YEARS IS ENOUGH EITHER WITH WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SO I THINK -- I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE YOU KNOW WE JUST PASSED THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WHO -- EITHER NO THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN THEIR HOMES OR MAYBE HAVING STARTED TO REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND THAT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM -- WHAT ONE LAST POINT AND THEN WE'LL CONTINUE WITH THE OTHER PANELISTS BUT TAKE OUT THE BIGGER RACER FIRES DIDN'T HAPPEN OR PUT IT A DIFFERENT WAY WE'RE STARTING OVER AGAIN AND YOU'RE SELLING YOUR NEXT POLICY TO ME WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED THAT WOULD INSTRUCT YOU TO MAYBE HOPE THAT -- I DO A SMARTER JOB AND IN THE INSURANCE THAT I NEED OR YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT YOU'VE BEEN BEEN GETTING THE X. THE REPLACEMENT COSTS IN THE AND ALL THE REST THAT YOU IS THAT IS EVERYTHING REALLY OKAY OKAY -- IN OUR COMMUNITY -- AND WITH WITH THE PEOPLE THAT LOST THEIR HOMES I I FEEL FEEL LIKE THINGS ARE ARE FAIRLY OKAY WITHIN OUR AGENCY BUT TAKES IS I MEAN NOW THAT WE'VE HAD THIS EVENT -- IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A HOMEOWNER OR A COMMERCIAL CLIENTS EVERY POLICY HOLDER WE HAVE -- IT WANTS TO REVIEW THEIR LIMIT SO WE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH OUR CLIENTS -- I CAN GIVE YOU AN IDEA -- I'VE GOT A OF A HOTEL OWNER THAT -- HE HAD HIS HOTEL INSURED FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A FOOT FOR FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS I'VE TRIED TO GET HIM TO INCREASE THAT WOULDN'T INCREASE IT WOULDN'T INCREASE IT YOU KNOW WE JUST INSTANCE INCREASED IT TO TO THE QUESTION SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A FOOT NOW BECAUSE HE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS SO SO IT'S THAT KIND OF IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TO ME THING AND OF THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENED AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW SO I THINK COMMUNICATION WITH THE AGENTS IN THE POLICY HOLDERS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO HIM -- WHEN EVERYTHING YOU OWN IS GONE -- WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO GO BACK THANK YOU MISTER THERE ARE MISTER JACKSON YOU'RE UP NEXT I UNDERSTAND YOU FIVE AT THE RAND CENTER FOR CATASTROPHIC RISK MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION YOU FINISHED A STUDY ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEIR IMPACT AND WE LOOK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING -- GOOD MORNING AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING YET TODAY ALL OUT GIVE SOME -- -- SOME OF THE FINDINGS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY WE DID US PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT AND IT WAS FUNDED BY THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AGENCY SO IN THIS STUDY WOULD WE DO WE COMPARED THE INSURANCE MARKET OUTCOMES DIFFERENT MEASURES OF HOW THE INSURANCE MARKETS PERFORMING IN ZIP CODES WITH A HIGH WILD FIRE RISK WITH IN -- WITH WITHOUT COMES AND ZIP CODES WITH -- LOW -- WILD FIRE RISK AND SO WHAT WE FIND AND I I CAN'T GO THROUGH ALL THE FINDINGS BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THE A FEW MOST RELEVANT TO THE -- THE HEARING TODAY OUR FIRST REGARDING THE THE COST TO THE PART OF THE PREMIUMS FOR HOMEOWNERS POLICIES WE LOOKED AT THE -- RATE PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF COVERAGE AND WE FOUND THAT IT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN THE END THE CODES WITH HIGH RISK KNOW YOU'D EXPECT THAT -- WE ALSO FOUND THAT THOSE RATES FOR THOUSAND DOLLARS COVERS BEEN INCREASING A LOT FASTER IN THE HIGH RISK ZIP CODES OF ALASKA -- -- SEVENTY SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY THOUSAND SEVEN SO WHAT WE FOUND WITH THAT DOLLARS OF COVERAGE WERE FIFTY PERCENT HIGHER IN THE HIGH RISK THE ZIP CODES AND THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THEY ROSE TWELVE PERCENT -- COMPARED TO LOW RISK OF CODES WERE THE ACTUALLY THE RATES FOR THOUSAND DOLLARS COVERAGE COVERAGE FELT FELT -- -- TWELVE PERCENT SO YOU SEE -- YOU KNOW THE MARKET ADJUSTING AND -- AND -- HIGHER AS YOU'D EXPECT HIGHER RATES IN HIGH RISK OF CODES NOW WHEN WE TALK TO THE -- YOU KNOW TALK TO THE INSURERS ABOUT THESE FINDINGS -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY BY A LARGE BELIEVE THAT THE HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK AREAS DO NOT FULLY REFLECT THE ACTUAL RISK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK AREAS THAT -- THAT -- THAT THERE'S SOME ABOUT COMPRESSION OF THE OF THE THE RATE DIFFERENCES ACROSS HIGH RISK AND LOW RISK AREAS -- WE ALSO TALKED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INSURANCE ABOUT THIS AND THEIR FEELING WAS THAT THEY POINTED OUT FIRST THAT THE RATES ARE INCREASING A LOT FASTER IN THE IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS IN THAT THE INSURERS REALLY NOT HAVE NOT PROVIDED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT -- -- GREATER RESTORE PRINCE OF RATE DIFFERENCES ARE WARRANTED -- BETWEEN THE TWO THE TWO AREAS THE SECOND AREA -- WANTED TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WAS WHAT WE FOUND OUT OF -- REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF COVERAGE AND TO LOOK AT THAT WE COMPARED THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE -- USING DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FIGHT BY INSURERS -- RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF THE STRUCTURES A RATIO OF COVERAGE TO -- TO INSURABLE OR REPLACEMENT COST OF THE OF THE STRUCTURE AND WE FOUND IT IN THE LOW RISK LOW ROB FOLLOWED WITH BLOW WILD FIRE RISK AREAS THAT THAT RATIO IS ROUGHLY HUNDRED PERCENT AMOUNTS WERE COMPARABLE TO THE REPLACEMENT AND -- MOUNTAIN THE LOWER OF WILD FIRE RISK AREAS AND THAT IN POINTED OUT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE EXTENDED -- THE JUST THE YOU KNOW THE BASIC COVERAGE JAY AND COVERAGE BE ON THE POLICY -- SO WHILE IT'S AROUND A HUNDRED PERCENT -- THAT REACHES RUN HOW TO PRESENT A LOW RISK AREAS IT IS LOWER IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS WE FOUND IT WAS ABOUT TEN PERCENTAGE POINT LOWER IN THE -- IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS -- SO SO SO THAT GIVES YOU SOME INDICATION THAT -- AND COME BACK TO THIS IN A MINUTE BUT -- THAT -- HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH RISK AREAS TEND TO -- BY A LESS COVERAGE RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF OF THE HOME -- TO PROVIDE ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE OF OF DATA ON A CONFIDENTIAL BASIS FROM A NUMBER OF INSURERS ON THE NUMBER OR PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTIAL LOT PART CLAIMS THAT UPDATED THE POLICY LIMIT YOU KNOW THAT'S ANOTHER INDICATION OF YOU KNOW HOW OFTEN PEOPLE ARE BUMPING UP AGAINST THEIR -- COVERAGE LIMITS AND HAVING COVERAGE PROBLEMS AND WE FOUND THAT -- THE INSURERS REPORTED ABOUT SIX PERCENT OF CLAIMS PAID AT THE POLICY LIMIT NO THAT'S NOT A HIGH PERCENTAGE BUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF -- A CLAIMS ARE SMALL CLAIMS AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT GONNA PLAY POLICY LIMIT SO WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T HAVE THE DATA TO LOOK AT -- WHAT PERCENT OF THE TOTAL LOSSES PAID AT THE POLICY LIMITS BUT IT'S PROBABLY UP SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER -- OKAY SO WE TALKED ABOUT -- -- HEARD ALREADY ON THE PANEL A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT -- THAT KNOW COVERAGE RATIOS MAY BE LOW IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS ONE OF WHICH THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A HOMEOWNER CHOICE TO SOME EXTENT AND THERE ARE YOU KNOW VERY PRICE SENSITIVE AND TEND TO -- WANT TO -- CONTROL OF OF THE COST OF COVERAGE AND IF ANY SAID THERE'S A LOT OF -- INFORMATION UNCERTAINTY AND LACK OF INFORMATION ON ON THIS WHOLE PROCESS OKAY SO -- THAT'S WE COME IN THE COVERAGE TO VALUE RATIO WE ALSO FOUND IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BUY HIGHS HAVE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES WE DIDN'T FIND THAT THAT WAS A HUGE OF FACT BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A -- -- TEND TO BE HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES IN HIGH RISK AREAS SO -- LET ME CONCLUDE BUT JUST OF MAKING A FEW OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OUR OUR FINDINGS -- FIRST -- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IT HOMEOWNER INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN CALIFORNIA REFLECT THE ACTUAL RISK -- IN THE PROPERTY OWNERS IN HIGH RISK AREAS ARE NOT CROSS SUBSIDIZED BY PROPERTY OWNERS AND LOW RISK AREAS AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF -- REASONS FOR THIS -- THE THE -- CALL THESE RISK BASE RATES AND -- YOU KNOW THE ADVANTAGE OF THESE RISK BASE RATES IS FIRST THAT THE CREATE INCENTIVES -- TO AVOID BUILDING AND THE RISK IF AREAS SECOND THEY CAN ENCOURAGE MITIGATION BY ALLOWING PREMIUM REDUCTIONS ARE DEDUCTIONS FOR RISK MITIGATION MEASURES AND THIRD YOU KNOW YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THOSE CROSS SUBSIDIES BETWEEN THE LOW RISK AREAS IN HIGH RISK AREAS THE STATE REALLY AREN'T FAIR THE LOW RISK AREAS YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW FROM POOR URBAN AREAS -- THE IN EFFECT -- CROSS SUBSIDIZING THE PREMIUMS IN HIGH RISK AREAS AND THESE THESE -- NOW THE IF YOU MOVE IF YOU GO TO RISK BASE RATES THERE ARE YOU KNOW GOING TO BE EXPENSIVE OR THAT THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND AND OUR WORKERS FOUND THAT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE YOU COULD WE WE SHOULD ONLY EXPECT THAT -- THROUGH THESE RATES TO INCREASE -- AS -- IS WILD PAR RISK -- INCREASES TO THE TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE SO THESE -- THESE -- HIGHER RATES IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CREATE SOME AFFORDABILITY PROBLEMS FOR CERTAIN CERTAIN HOUSEHOLDS BUT I THINK GOT YOU KNOW MY POINT IS AND IT'S JUST A THOUGHT FOR YOU KNOW HOW TO PROCEED MOVING FORWARD THAT RATHER THAN YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING AS A YOU KNOW THE STATE THAT THE RATHER THAN PROVIDING CROSS SUBSIDIES TO YOU KNOW TO REDUCE RATES FOR ALL HOMEOWNERS IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS THAT WE TARGET THOSE SUBSIDIES TO THE HOUSEHOLDS THE MOST NEED THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PROGRAM WHAT YOU CONGRESS HAS ASKED THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM TO DEVELOP AFFORDABILITY PROGRAMS FLOOD INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO HOUSEHOLDS LOW INCOME LOW NETWORK HOUSEHOLDS IN YOU KNOW HIGH FLOOD RISK AREAS AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THOSE KIND OF WORRY ABOUT FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT AND WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THAT BUT -- YOU KNOW I I THINK WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH THE STATE WITH RISK BASE RATES WITH TARGETED SUBSIDIES TO THE HOUSEHOLDS THE NEED THEM AS OPPOSED TO -- CROSS SUBSIDIES THAT MAKE RATES CHEAPER FOR ALL A HOUSEFUL TONIGHT RISK AREAS MANY WHICH -- -- CAN BE VERY WEALTHY REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF OF COVERAGE -- YOU KNOW THESE HIGHER PREMIUMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CREATE OBVIOUS INCENTIVES FOR POLICY HOLDERS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE THAT THEY BY AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE REASONS THAT -- THAT LEAD UP POLICY HOLDERS TO DO THAT AND I I DO AGREE WITH THE WITH WITH THE TH ON THE PANEL THE IMPORTANCE OF YOU'RE REVIEWING THAT THAT PURCHASE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THE POLICY HOLDERS FULLY UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW THE TRADE OFFS OF OF WHAT THEY'RE CHOOSING -- NO FOR A HIGH INCOME HOUSEHOLD YOU KNOW IF THEY WANT TO BUY A LOAF LOW AMOUNT OF COVERAGE FOR THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE FINE YOU KNOW WE DON'T WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THEM -- BUT -- FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT -- MAY HAVE LESS INFORMATION UNLESS PROCESS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE STRUCTURE THAT PROCESS TO -- YOU KNOW FULLY -- COMMUNICATE -- AND PROVIDE THE RIGHT INCENTIVES FOR ALL THE PARTIES TO COMMUNICATE VIA THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN -- BUYING HIGHER LEVELS VERSUS LOWER LEVELS OF COVERAGE AT THAT THANK YOU MISTER DIXON FOR YOUR -- YOUR WISDOM -- FINALLY AT BATTING CLEANUP HERE ON THE PANEL -- MISTER FRAZIER FROM THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA REX THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THE SAME WAY YOU OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRE SEASON WAS DEVASTATING AND FOR INSURANCE INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH WAS INTENSE WITH PERSONNEL RELOCATING FROM OTHER STATES TO ENSURE IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF CUSTOMERS ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES AND SOME AGENTS HELPING CUSTOMERS WHILE THEY HAD LOST THEIR OWN HOME -- THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRE LOSSES WIPED OUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF UNDERWRITING PROFITS DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND ONE BUT IMPORTANTLY THERE'S NO REPORT OF ANY INSURANCE SOLVENCY RELATED TO THE FIRES AT THIS POINT OUR MEMBERS REPORT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS OVER NINETY PERCENT ARE CLOSED BUT THESE ARE TYPICALLY NOT GOING TO BE THE TOTAL LOSSES OTHER MORE LIKELY TO BE CLAIMS SUCH AS SMOKE CLAIMS THE REMAINING OPEN CLAIMS ARE OBVIOUSLY MORE COMPLICATED TOTAL LOSSES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CLAIMS MANAGERS REPORT SIGNIFICANT RECONSTRUCTION COST INCREASES FOLLOWING THE FIRES IN CINEMA NAPA COUNTIES A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED LABOR AS A PARENT DRIVING LARGE PRICE INCREASES OF PARTICULAR NOTE ARE REPORTS OF FRAMING CONTRACTORS ATTEMPTING TO NAME THEIR PRICE RAISING THE ISSUE OF BEHAVIOR THAT'S MORE THAN SIMPLY DEMAND SEARCH THE FEEDBACK IS CAN STEP FEEDBACK IS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC REPORTING ON TO NOVA HOMES PULLING OUT OF AN ARRANGEMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR TO REBUILD HOMES ON A BALK BASIS IN CINEMA COUNTY THEY SPECIFICALLY SITED AN INABILITY TO SECURE FRAMERS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS CUSTOMERS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH HIGH COST PRELIMINARY CONTRACTOR ESTIMATES THE LACKING SUFFICIENT DETAIL FOR INSURERS TO EVALUATE -- LEADING TO CUSTOMER ALARM ABOUT INADEQUATE COVERAGE WHEN INSURERS HAVE PURSUED ADDITIONAL DETAILS THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE UPGRADES TO LOST HOME WERE INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE AND HAD TO BE BACKED OUT FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES SUCH AS WELLS AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS WERE BIT AS COMPLETE REPLACEMENTS WITHOUT ADEQUATE INVESTIGATION AS TO WHETHER A MORE LIMITED REPAIR WOULD BE WARRANTED IN SUCH SITUATIONS MANY ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN EYEBROW RAISING WITH ESTIMATES WELL ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT WHICH CLAIMS PROFESSIONALS TO HELP TO ROOM TO REDUCE WITH A MORE INVESTIGATION -- TRYING TO GET WELL DOCUMENTED BIDS FOR POLICYMAKERS CONCERNED ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF STRUCTURAL INSURANCE COVERAGE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED AFTER THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRES IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AT THAT TIME RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURERS TYPICALLY OFFERED A GUARANTEED REPLACEMENT COST POLICY WE'RE NOT SURE PROMISED TO REBUILD THE HOME NO MATTER HOW MUCH COVERAGE THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD PURCHASED DURING THOSE DAYS DISPUTES IN SUED AS TO WHETHER THE CUSTOMER WAS OVER INSURED BECAUSE SOME CUSTOMERS OBVIOUSLY WOULD ATTEMPT TO PRESS FOR LOWER COVERAGE LIMITS KNOWING THAT THE INSURER WOULD STILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A COMPLETE REBUILD REGARDLESS OF THE COVERAGE PURCHASED FOLLOWING OAKLAND HILLS THE FIRST ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER JOHN GARAMENDI EXERTED TREMENDOUS PRESSURE UPON INSURERS TO INCREASE THEIR PAYMENTS WELL BEYOND THE REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATES WHICH SPURRED THE MARKET TO MIGRATE AWAY FROM GUARANTEED REPLACEMENT COST POLICIES -- OAKLAND SENATOR NICK PETROUS RESPONDED WITH LEGISLATION EXPLICITLY ALLOWING REPLACEMENT COST COVERAGE WITH A MAXIMUM DOLLAR LIMIT ON STRUCTURAL REPAIR ALONG WITH MANDATES FOR INCREASED INSURER EXPLANATION OF COVERAGES AND DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE RISK BOTH OF UNDER INSURANCE AS WELL AS DEMAND SURGED FOLLOWING A WIDESPREAD DISASTER WELL THERE ARE SOME GUARANTEED REPLACEMENT COST POLICIES REMAINING IN THE MARKET THE INDUSTRY STANDARD TODAY IS THE LESS EXPENSIVE OPTION A REPLACEMENT COST COVERAGE OF THE MAXIMUM POLICY BENEFIT WHICH IS ELIMINATED COMPLAINTS ABOUT OVER INSURANCE BUT HAS LED SOME TO WORRY ABOUT UNDER INSURANCE DOCTOR DIXON CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT CALCULATES FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M AWARE A SYSTEMATIC MEASUREMENT OF UNDER INSURANCE AND WHETHER IT'S PERVASIVE IN HIGH RISK AREAS IN A STUDY CALCULATED THE COVERAGE LEVELS BETWEEN NINETY THREE PERCENT AND ONE HUNDRED FOUR PERCENT OF HOME RECONSTRUCTION COSTS AND IMPORTANTLY THAT MEASURE DID NOT INCLUDE EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST FEATURES WHICH ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE THOSE THOSE DATA HIGHLIGHT ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REGULATIONS MANDATED MANDATING THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATES WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING CUSTOMERS SELECT APPROPRIATE PROTECTION FOR THEIR PROPERTY WELL THE CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY INSURANCE INDUSTRIES WELL CAPITALIZE THERE ARE TRENDS FOR POLICY MAKERS TO MONITOR REGARDING AFFORDABILITY CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RATE IS JUST ABOVE ARE JUST BELOW THE AVERAGE IN THE COUNTRY WITH HURRICANE PRONE STATES SUCH AS TEXAS AND FLORIDA APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THERE HAVE BEEN -- THERE'S BEEN A SLOW RISE OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RATES IN HIGH RISK AREAS HOWEVER INSURERS STILL EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT RATE INADEQUACY AND THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS REGARDING AVAILABILITY ADMITTED IN MARKETING SURE IS STILL SERVE HIGH RISK AREAS BUT THERE HAS BEEN A SMALL BUT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF EIGHT PERCENT AND THEIR PRESENCE IN THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS WE BELIEVE THIS DECREASE REFLECTS BOTH ENSURE SOLVENCY CONCERNS -- WELL IN CHURCH RELATED BOTH TO AVOIDING OVER CONCENTRATION IN HIGH RISK AREAS AS WELL AS GRADUALLY WITHDRAWING FROM AREAS WHERE INSURERS ARE NOT PERMITTED BY THE STATE TO CHARGE ADEQUATE PRICES LOOKING FORWARD WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERAL ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA AS HOUSING HAS EXPANDED FURTHER INTO THE FOREST CHAPARRAL AND CRAFT GRASSLAND AREAS WERE FIRES HAVE NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO BURN THE RISK OF LOSS HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY ENSURE RATING PLANS HAVE GENERALLY INVOLVED TO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNTS FOR FIRE RESILIENT BUILDING MATERIALS VERTICALLY FOR ROOFING AND SIDING BUT CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING CODE NEWEST BUILDING CODE IS VERY STRONG BUT THE TUBS FIRE BURNED EVEN THE NEWEST HOMES AT RATES EQUIVALENT TO OLDER HOMES INSURERS DO ENCOURAGE SITE SPECIFIC DEFENSIBLE SPACE AS WELL AS COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION BUT SUCH WORTHWHILE EFFORTS TO NOT STOP A MASSIVE FIRE EMBERS CAN LAND FROM TWO OR THREE MILES AWAY WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT SB NINE NO ONE WILL ACT AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD SIGNIFICANT FUEL REDUCTION WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY GIVEN ALL THE HOMES INSURED AND -- WE WE AREA BUT THERE'S CLEARLY MUCH MORE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT INSURANCE WILL REMAIN AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE AND EVERY COMMUNITY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT FROM THE INSURERS POINT OF VIEW AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I WANT INVITE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL TO ASK QUESTIONS AND -- START WITH SENATOR DODD AND SENATOR MORE SO IN GIPSON FORGET MISTER FRAZIER -- YOU AT THE TOP OF YOUR -- PRESENTATION YOU TALKED ABOUT -- COULD YOU REPEAT THAT -- THESE FIRES WIPED OUT PROFITS FROM IT WAS A SPECIFIC YEARS DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SIXTEEN YEARS OF INSURER PROFITS HOMEOWNERS LINE OF BUSINESS AND HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN WHEN THERE'S -- ABSOLUTE LIABILITY M. P. GENIE IS PICKING UP -- THE COST WITH ABSOLUTE LIABILITY I UNDERSTAND YOU SUBGRADE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE PERCENT BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WIPES OUT THE PROFITS FROM ALL THOSE YEARS WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECOVERY AT THIS POINT FROM A UTILITY IS THIS IS MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE A CRY ME A RIVER TYPE OF COMMENT IF YOU WILL AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT BACK TO THESE OTHER THESE OTHER -- WILDFIRES -- THAT WE COULD BE CAUSED BY UTILITIES A AND P. GENIES PAYING THE COST OR AT LEAST A SUBURB GATED COST FROM WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME THIS SOMEWHERE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SIXTY AND SIXTY FIVE PERCENT WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TUBS FIRE AND IN THE MEANTIME THAT'S SURELY COMPANIES INSURANCE COMPANIES SUGGEST THESE CLAIMS SO I'M JUST REPORTING THE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED THAN THOSE NUMBERS WILL CHANGE BUT THAT'S THE NUMBER WE CURRENTLY HAVE I I I I JUST WANTED TO ADD SOME DAYLIGHT TO THAT THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE WAY IT'S GOING TO BE AND STOP THE WAY IT'S GONNA PASS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A UTILITY COSTS ARE I I WOULD SPEND YEAH WHEN THERE'S BEEN A UTILITY BECAUSE FIRE I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THOUGH THE UTILITY CAUSE FIRES ARE THE VAST MINORITY OF FIRES -- LESS GENERALLY TEN PERCENT OR LESS OF FIRES ARE RELATED TO UTILITIES -- INSURANCE COMPANIES PAY FOR ALL THE FIRES AND IF A UTILITY OR SOME OTHER THIRD PARTY COSTA FIRE THEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SUBROGATION BUT IT'S TYPICALLY NOT A UTILITY FIRE WELL I RESPECT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF TODAY'S PRAYER AND OF COURSE HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE TUBS FIRE YEAH I RESPECT THAT BUT GOING TO BE ZERO A VEHICLE FOR CERTAIN YEAH SO -- SO IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- WITH WITH THOSE TYPE OF SUBROGATION I'M JUST NOT SURE -- THAT I I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF INVESTIGATION IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE RATES ARE ESTABLISHED PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE SEGREGATING -- YOU KNOW FROM BY THE UTILITY COMPANIES WILL WE'RE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE I STATE REGULATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ON RATES AND NO INSURANCE COMPANY IS PERMITTED TO EITHER INCREASE OR DECREASE ITS RATES WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO IT'S NOT AS IF AN INSURANCE COMPANY JUST MAKES THIS UP THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE DIALOGUE AND MUST PROVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THAT IS IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND THERE'S IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR A RATE FILING TO EXCEED A YEAR SO IT'S YOU KNOW RATES ARE NOT ESTABLISHED CASUALLY AND BELIEVE ME THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE STAFF THEY'RE EXTREMELY EXPERIENCED I'D WORKED THERE WORKED WITH THEM FOR SIX YEARS -- THEY KNOW THIS -- THEY KNOW THIS RATING STRUCTURE -- QUITE EXPERTLY AND ADDED AND IN MY VIEW DO ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARD CONSUMER INTERESTS THANK YOU UP OF OF ALL OF THIS CHAIR YEAH SURE CHAIRS -- WHAT WHAT ONE OF MY EXPERIENCES IN TRYING TO GET TOUGH LEGISLATION THROUGH THE WILDFIRES I DO -- WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRS AND PUTTING UP WITH -- ME AND AND AND AND OTHERS -- BECAUSE IT WAS TOUGH TIME FOR THE REST OF THE PANEL AND I THINK ALSO FOR FOR MISTER FRAZIER FOR ME IT SEEMS LIKE WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTING TO THINGS THAT -- THAT NEED TO HAPPEN LIKE -- THE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE VOLUNTARILY CAME UP WITH SEVENTY PERCENT OF CONTENTS WITHOUT INVENTORY VOLUNTARILY MOST OF BUT YEAH WHEN WE TRIED TO GET MORE -- FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS EITHER PAST OR FUTURE -- THERE WAS NO OFFER EVEN CLOSE TO THAT EVEN WHEN IT WAS A WILD FIRE -- NATURAL DISASTER GOVERNOR DECLARED DISASTER WE HAD SOME OTHER -- -- LEGISLATION WHICH I WON'T GO INTO BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AN INSURANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS NOT THAT WELL I GUESS AND IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION USED WE SIT THERE ON THE DIET SAYS COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY COMES OUT AND SAYS OVER IF YOU DO THIS THEN YOUR RATES EVERYBODY'S RATES IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO GO OUT OKAY NOBODY WANTS THAT I THINK THAT'S -- THAT'S A CONDITION THAT -- WERE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER IT'S -- PGD -- POWER RATES OR WHETHER IT'S INSURANCE RATES OR ANY THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT -- WE REGULATE BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO NOT ONLY EVERYBODY BUT WE JUST MIGHT MOVE OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA MARKET AND WE'RE JUST NOT COULD ENSURE THEIR OR WILL PULL OUT OF THE WILDLAND FIRE AND WILL STAY IN OTHER AREAS BUT NOT DOING I GUESS TO THE TO THE TO THE PANEL HOW DO WE AS LEGISLATORS OR HOW DO COMMITTEE MEMBERS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE OPINING I WANT TO USE BE -- SO I CAN I THE I GUESS I CAN DO THAT THE TO I DON'T THINK THEY USE THOSE WORDS BUT IN IN ESSENCE THERE SAY NO THAT'S NOT CORRECT YOU LOOK AT THE NUMERATOR IS LIKE FIVE THOUSAND THE DENOMINATORS TWELVE MILLION POLICY HOLDERS THAT IS NOT CORRECT AND THEN WE HAVE YOUR OTHERS THAT COME IN A WAY IT ON BOTH SIDES THEN THE -- I I GUESS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS SOME DIRECTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT SERVE ON THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE WHAT ARE OTHER FACTORS TO MITIGATE THESE TYPE OF THINGS TO GET IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THROUGH TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS THIS IS ALL WE ARE TRYING TO DO FOR THE VERY VERY BEGINNING A HAD DISAPPOINTING BUT I CERTAINLY RESPECT MY COLLEAGUES AT SERVE ON THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT IS NOT AN OUTCOME IT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS OR TWELVE MILLION POLICY HOLDERS SO I'D LIKE TO -- DIRECTION -- FROM THE OTHER ELEMENT PANELS THIS BLOCK YOU WANNA BEGIN THANK YOU YES -- -- SO THIS DOES KIND OF DRAW DOWN THERE'S JUSTICES FINITE NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE VOLUNTARY AND ENHANCEMENTS OF FROM REX'S CLIENTS FROM FROM THE CARES MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE AND I HAVE THE SAME FRUSTRATION THAT YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF WELL YOU KNOW THE THAT THIS WE HEARD OKAY SIX PERCENT OF CLAIMS PAID A POLICY LIMIT WE HAVE A VERY SMALL SUBSET OKAY OF OF THE OF THE INSURERS CLIENTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO HELP RIGHT THERE'S A VERY SMALL UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED EVERY DOLLAR AVAILABLE UNDER THEIR POLICY IN ORDER TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET OKAY SO WE'RE REALLY ARE HERE TO FOCUS ON THOSE PEOPLE RIGHT SO WE HAVE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE TWO THIRDS OF THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE OVERALL THAT'S THAT'S A WE HAVE A REAL SERIOUS MARKET PLACE PROBLEM OKAY -- THERE THEN WE HAVE THE THE PROOF REQUIREMENTS WE KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF INSURERS DID IN FACT STEP UP VOLUNTARILY AND SO THERE TO DO SEVENTY AND SOME DID A HUNDRED -- PAY OUT ON CONTENTS WITHOUT ITEMS ATION BUT SAME FRUSTRATION I HAD BUT THEN YOU SAY WELL WHY CAN'T WE JUST MAKE THAT A LAW NO NO NO NO NO AND THEN WE HAVE THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT ABOUT THAT I I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE LOGIC BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE THOUSANDS OF FIRE SURVIVORS I'VE WORKED WITH SEE IT THE SAME WAY I SEE IT WHICH IS IF I PAID A PREMIUM FOR TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND CONTENTS COVERAGE AND EVERYTHING I HAVE IS GONE WHY AREN'T I GETTING A CHECK FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND SO I DO THINK WE NEED JUST TO REALLY HAVE A SIT DOWN AND NOT WITH A LOT OF YOU KNOW NOT NEW GET A LOVE THE MEDIA BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW CLOSE THE DOOR LITTLE MORE FREE TALKING EXECUTIVES TO SAY WHAT THEY CAN DO BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAD STEVE BOYS NEGOTIATED THE VOLUNTARY CLAIMS ARE FORMS -- DAVE JONES HAS HAS -- KEPT THOSE IN PLACE AFTER EVERY DISASTER SO WE KNOW THAT THE CARRIERS CAN DO SOME THINGS TO MAKE OF THEIR THEIR CUSTOMERS -- LIVES BETTER BUT ALSO TO TO DO WHAT WE ALL WANT THEM TO DO WHICH IS PAY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN SO PEOPLE ARE IN A POSITION TO MAKE DECISIONS AND YOU DON'T HAVE THIS WHOLE RIPPLE EFFECT OF WHY KEITH WOODS AND I ARE CONSTANTLY ON PANELS TOGETHER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHY DO WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY TWO HOMES AND YOU KNOW REBUILT AND IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR SO THERE'S THERE'S THE THERE ARE SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT I THINK WITH THE WITH THE THE TAKING OF EXPANDING THE VOLUNTARY CLOSER FORMS YEAH WE COULDN'T GET IT THROUGH AN LEGISLATION BUT WE KNOW WE'VE GOT A BIG RUNNING START HERE I'M YOU KNOW AND AND AND AGAIN I MEAN -- THE FOR THE FACT THAT THE INSURERS THAT REX IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY INVESTMENT INCOME IS SUPPOSED TO PROFITS WERE WIPED OUT BUT REGARDLESS IF IF IN FACT YOU KNOW YEAH THIS WAS THIS WAS THIS WAS AN EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY FIRE OF BUT AGAIN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR BROADER THEY OF THEIR BROADER CUSTOMER BASE THIS IS STILL A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS SO I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN WILDFIRE TOTAL LOSSES ARE DIFFERENT THEY NEED TO BE TREATED TO THEY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED DIFFERENTLY ALL THIS THIS DEPRECIATION AND A WHOLE BOX OF ACTUAL CASH VALUE I UNDERSTAND WHY INSURERS DO THAT IN THE DAY TO DAY CLAIMS BUT IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS IS JUST CRUEL SO I KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER FOR FOR FOR YOUR CHURCH CARRIERS TRY TO PREDICT LOSSES RIGHT THEY'VE GOT TEAMS OF ACTUARIES TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS STUFF OUT THE MODELS ARE ALL BLOWN TO HELL I MEAN NOBODY THOUGHT COPY PARK WITH BURKE COPY PARK IS NOT A WILD FIRES ON SO THAT THE I THINK THE WAY THAT THE INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE LOOKED AT THESE MODELING'S AND TRY TO PRICE THEIR BUSINESS GOING OUT THE WINDOW MORE HAVE AND -- HURRICANES GO PLACES THEY HAVEN'T GONE WE'RE HAVING TORNADOES IN PLACES THEY HAVEN'T GONE SO -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE THE FORTUNATE THING FOR FOR THIS TERRIBLE EVENT THAT WE HAD IS THAT IT WOULD BECAUSE IT WAS A FIRE YOU KNOW IT WAS LARGELY AN INSURED EVENT IT WASN'T LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE OR A FLOOD WHERE WERE THOSE THINGS AREN'T INSURED BUT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THE INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE A WAY TO -- PRICE POLICIES -- WITH WITH MODELS -- BECAUSE THE MODELS ARE HOLDING UP THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE SO THEY DO THAT BUT IT BUT IT IS IT IS IT IS A DIFFICULT THING FOR THEM TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE A COPY PART BURKE FOR EXAMPLE YEAH I THAT THAT MY ANGLE ON THAT LOOKING AT THAT IS -- THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE IN THE IN THE HIGH WILD FIRST WILDFIRE RISK AREAS AND SIR WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THE ADMITTED MARKET IS -- YOU KNOW TENDING TO IS NERVOUS ABOUT THOSE AREAS THAT THE MARKET SHARE OF THE SURPLUS LINES CARRIERS INCREASING THE MARKET SHARE THE FAIR PLAN IS INCREASING IN THOSE HIGH RISK AREAS AND INSURERS -- YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY POINT TO WELL THEY POINT TO THAT WERE NOT ABLE TO CHARGE THE THE THE RATE THAT WE NEED TO STAY IN THOSE AREAS -- THAT THAT'S -- THAT'S ONE THING YOU HERE AND THEN THERE'S ALSO SOME OTHER ISSUES REGARDING REINSURANCE AND OTHER THINGS A BRING UP BUT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS MAKING THE MARKET FUNCTION WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE SOME INDICATORS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE GOT ISSUES AND I WITH THIS THE HIGH WILD FOR RISK AREAS THAT WE WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT MOVING FORWARD YES TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY RESPONSE I'M I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE GENERAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY LINE WAS YOU BETTER DO WHAT WE WANT OR WE'RE GOING TO EXTORT YOU AND LEAVE YOUR COMMUNITIES I JUST I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE SAID THIS YEAR AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING MOVING FORWARD WHAT I TRIED TO POINT OUT IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM IN THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS THAT'S WHAT DOCTOR DIXON'S RESEARCH SHOWED BUT THE ADMITTED MARKET IS STILL SERVING EVERY COMMUNITY BUT THERE'S A PUSH AND PULL EVERY TIME THAT LET'S SAY AMY SAYS WELL JUST PAY COVERAGE LIMITS WITHOUT LOOKING AT ACTUAL LOSS OKAY RATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL LOSSES AND THAT'S BUT THE NOTION THAT WE JUST WOULD REQUIRE PAYMENT AT POLICY LIMITS WITHOUT A DOCUMENT TO THE BOSS THAT'S CLEARLY GOING TO INCREASE CLAIMS PAY OUT OKAY AS A PUBLIC POLICY YOU MIGHT DECIDE YOU WANT TO DO THAT THEN WILL YOU ALSO BE ADVOCATING WITH US AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO HELP US GET IT INCREASED RATES SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PAY FOR THOSE LOSSES I DOUBT IT SO THERE'S ALWAYS PRESSURE ON INSURANCE COMPANIES YOU MUST SAY YES TO EVERY APPLICATION YOU MUST RENEW EVERYONE BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA LET YOU CHARGE ADEQUATE RATES FOR THE BUSINESS YOU'RE GOING TO DO AND BY THE WAY ASK FEWER QUESTIONS WHEN YOU'RE PAYING CLAIMS AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE MORE GENEROUS THOSE ALL TOGETHER MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DO BUSINESS IN EVERY COMMUNITY SO WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SERVE IN EVERY COMMUNITY BECAUSE INSURANCE AGENTS ARE IN EVERY COMMUNITY THERE ON EVERY LITTLE LEAGUE FENCE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WHO WHO TALKED WITH LOCAL KNOWLEDGE INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS ARE THERE AS WELL CALIFORNIA'S AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PLACE TO DO BUSINESS BUT YET OUR RATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE THEIR HALF OF WHAT THE AVERAGE IS IN TEXAS AND IN FLORIDA SO IT'S NOT AS IF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SAYING WE NEED CRAZY RATES AND IF YOU DON'T DO IT BAD THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN BUT WE DID NEGOTIATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ELEVEN BILLS TO COMPLETION THIS YEAR IN EACH ONE ADDED INCREMENTAL COSTS TO THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RECOVER THOSE IN RATES AS WELL SO IT'S NOT AS IF WE JUST SAT BACK AND SAID NO WE WORKED TRULY HARD FOR SEVEN MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST COMPROMISE SO THAT WE COULD BE GOOD PARTICIPANTS IN THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND ALL COMMUNITIES FOR THAT MATTER -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WE'RE HERE TO PROBLEM SOLVE WITH YOU AND ACKNOWLEDGE IF WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO ADDRESS THEM WE'RE NOT AFRAID TO TO TO TO BE TOLD WE SHOULD DO BETTER WERE OPEN FOR THAT BUT THE NOTION THAT THERE'S JUST A SOME SORT OF MASS PROBLEM THERE SO MANY SO MANY CUSTOMERS WHO DON'T COME TO AMY'S COMMUNITY FORMS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WONDERFUL CLAIMS EXPERIENCES BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO COME AND FILL OUT A SURVEY ASKING IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM OKAY I WENT OUT WE HAVE OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE MORE QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED IN OUR TIME IS RUNNING A LITTLE SHORT AS SENATOR MORE LOCK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON CENTER LARA ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER DER AND MR DICTION YOU BROUGHT UP THE CONSUMER CHOICE ASPECT OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND SO WHEN A CONSUMER WANTS TO PROTECT AN ASSET LIKE A CAR THEY CAN BUY LIABILITY INSURANCE SO THEY CAN GET FULL COVERAGE THAT THEY MAKE CHOICES RIGHT CORRECT SO -- WHEN IT COMES TO UP PURCHASING A HOME YOU WANT TO PROTECT ITS A MAJOR INVESTMENT BUT YOU WANT TO PROTECT IT ALSO FOR COLLATERAL PURPOSES BECAUSE YOU BORROWED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM A LENDER THE PIPE THAT HOME AND I'M I DON'T HAVE THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AT THE TABLE BUT ARE THE A MAJOR FORCE IN SAYING YOU'VE GOT OF ME YOU'RE MANDATED TO BUY THIS INSURANCE YEAH I MEAN AND AND THAT'S PART OF THE EDUCATION THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH OUR CLIENTS TO ME OFTENTIMES WE WE GET A SAYING I'M BUYING THIS HOUSE HERE'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST MY LOAN IS -- FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MY COST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPLACE ITSELF SO THAT'S WHERE -- YOU KNOW THE CONSUMERS DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS THINK I NEED TO ENSURE FOR THE SCENARIO I'VE USUALLY TO ENSURE FOR OLD WILL MY LOAN IS BUT -- YOU KNOW AGAIN IF THAT HOUSE BURNS -- IF EVERYTHING IN THAT THAT HOUSE BURNS ON WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE TO TO -- TO REBUILD IT THAT'S THAT'S THE EDUCATION PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH THE CLIENTS AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND IN HEALTH HAVE THEM HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR TOTAL LOSS SCENARIO WOULD LOOK LIKE SO THAT THEY CAN GET OUT WE CAN PROVIDE ADEQUATE COVERAGE FOR THAT SO THE VICE MAYOR POINTED OUT THAT WE CAN EXPECT THE NUMBER OF LOTS BEING SOLD IS THAT BECAUSE OF BANK TRANSACTIONS WHERE THEY JUST FINALLY SAID I CAN'T MAKE THE MONTHLY PAYMENT I GOTTA JUST CUT ARM WHAT WE'RE SEE WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE THE THE LENDERS KEEPING THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR I MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE BORROWERS I MEAN IN A PERFECT WORLD THE LENDER STICKS WITH THEM INSURANCE COMPANY STICKS WITH THEM THROUGH THAT REBUILD PROCESS THE INSURANCE OR IS THE NEW HOUSE THE THE THE LENDER HAS THE SAME LOAN OR WORKED WITH THEM ON A CONSTRUCTION LOAN THAT THAT'S IN A PERFECT WORLD BUT MOST OF THE LOTS THAT WE SEE GOING UP FOR SALE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE -- EITHER JUST MOVED OUT OF THE AREA OR SIMPLY BOUGHT ANOTHER HOUSE AND AND THEY'RE YOU KNOW THEY WERE ON THE FENCE IF THEY WERE GONNA REBUILD OR NOT BUT THEY'VE DECIDED TO DO STUFF WITH A LOT ON THE MARKET AND SELL THE CASE SO I JUST LOOK AT MORTGAGE COMPANIES AS A FORCE THAT ISN'T RESIDENT THE ROOM ARE THERE ANY OTHER FORCES THAT ARE DICTATING WHAT PURCHASE WHAT A PURCHASER SHOULD BE LOOKING AT FOR THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE THERE ARE I'M NOT REALLY IN IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT TO THE MORTGAGE COMPANY ONLY WANT TO PROTECT THEIR THEIR LOAN VALUE THEY DON'T CARE FOR THE THE HOMEOWNERS AND MAY HOLE IN A IN A LOSS SITUATION AS LONG AS THEIR LOAN IS PROTECTED SO I BELIEVE THAT SOME THOUGH WILL REQUIRE THAT THE POLICY BE A REPLACEMENT VALUE POLICY NUMBER IN A CD I HAVE SEEN THAT NEW ON IN A MORE LOCK IT I'M JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE WE'VE GOT SOME FORCE SOMEBODY SALAS THE BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND THEN WE CAN GO FROM A YOU GO TO A CADILLAC OUR CHOICE CORRECT I MEAN AND THEN YOU KNOW THEN THAT A ROUGHLY A THIRD OF HOMES DON'T HAVE MORTGAGES SO YOU KNOW INDIA THAN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PRESSURE IN THAT CASE MADE AND WE ARE SEEING A MY ORGANIZATION IS DEFINITELY SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DISASTER VICTIMS WHO HAVE NO INSURANCE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT I I MEAN AND IF IF I CAN TAKE ONE MINUTE -- I AM NOT HERE DENIES YOUR CLIENTS I'M FACT AND I WANT YOUR CLIENTS TO THRIVE AND AND BE HEALTHY THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME OUT FINE -- BUT WE'RE HERE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T COME OUT FINE AND HAVE BEEN COMING TO ELECTED OFFICIALS FOR HELP -- AND I YOU KNOW OUR ORGANIZATION FROM DAY ONE HAS BEEN TELLING PEOPLE DON'T BE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH WHEN YOU'RE INSURING YOUR BIGGEST ASSET THE PROBLEM IS AND AND AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN FULLY ANTICIPATING THAT RATES ARE GOING TO ARE GOING TO BE GOING UP GIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS IT'S WE WORK IN OTHER STATES WHERE THERE ARE HURRICANE SO WE'VE SEEN IT -- AND AND YOU KNOW YES THE CALIFORNIA MARKET IS STILL A HEALTHY WE WANT TO KEEP IT HEALTHY BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE THE THE CAR COMPETITION BETWEEN INSURERS FOR CLIENTS IS PART OF WHAT'S FUELING THIS UNDER INSURANCE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU KNOW I'D HAVE HAD A LOT OF INSURANCE EXACTS POINT THE FINGERS AT A COMPETITORS THEY WILL THEY THEY LOW BALLED THE ESTIMATE SO I GOT A LOW BALL THE ESTIMATE IF I WANT TO KEEP IF I WANT TO YOU KNOW GET THAT CLIENT AND YEAH YOU KNOW I AND I DON'T KNOW VERY MANY CONSUMERS ARE SUPER KEEN TO PAY ANYMORE FOR INSURANCE AND THE ABSOLUTE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU JUST HAVE AN EXPECTATION IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND THAT THE INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS KNOW THEIR JOB AND THEY'RE GONNA TALENT SO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN COMING TO OUR OVERFLOW YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED OF OF PEOPLE AT A SHOT WORKSHOPS ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE MOST WILL TELL YOU AND THEY WILL TAKE A LIE DETECTOR TEST AND TELL YOU THIS YOU KNOW I ASKED IF I HAD FULL COVERAGE AND I WAS TOLD MY COVERAGE WAS ADEQUATE AND I'VE SEEN THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CONSUMERS AND THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES AND AGENTS AND THEY WERE LULLED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY AND WE JUST HAVE TO BREAK OKAY ANOTHER MISTER FRAZIER QUICK RESPONSE THAT YEAH BUT THAT'S THE I CAN'T LET THAT STAND WHEN MY ON WHEN IF INDEED AN AGENT WOULD SAY I'M GUARANTEEING THE ADEQUACY OF COVERAGE THE POLICY IS CONVERTED TO A GUARANTEED REPLACEMENT COST POLICY BY VIRTUE OF THAT REPRESENTATION SO THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE LULLED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BY MISREPRESENTATION AND HAVE NO RECOURSE THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE RECOURSE IN THAT COMPANY IS GOING TO PAY THAT CLAIM NOW WHAT I SEE HAPPEN IS YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WILL EXAMINE SITUATIONS WHERE REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT AND -- THERE'S THERE'S NO DOUBT WHAT THEY'RE CALCULATING AS THEIR ESTIMATE BUT LET'S SAY IT'S LOWER THAN COMPANY BE COMING ALONG AND SAYING WELL -- THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO GO HIGHER IN YOUR COVERAGE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS LONG AS THE THE -- THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FORTHRIGHT IN SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE CALCULATE YOUR ESTIMATE ADS -- IF OFTENTIMES IF AN AGENT IF THE SECOND AGENT CAN'T COME ALONG AND SAY NO NO THAT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU REALLY NEED TO PAY MORE AND GET THIS -- THEN THE LAW DOES NOT PREVENT THE PERSON FROM CHOOSING THE LOWER AMOUNT OF COVERAGE AS LONG AS THERE'S BEEN ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE BECAUSE IN THE END IT'S THE CUSTOMER'S CHOICE AS TO HOW MUCH INSURANCE THEY WANT TO PURCHASE IT'S AN SO THERE IS NO LAW THAT SAYS -- AN INSURANCE AGENT FOR INSTANCE HAS A FIDUCIARY DUTY TO PUT THE CUSTOMER'S INTERESTS FIRST IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT GOES WRONG AFTERWARD THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE LAW OKAY VERY GOOD SO WHAT AT CENTER YOU VERY GOOD I HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID RATHER HAVE INSURANCE THE NOT NEEDED THEY NEEDED NOT HAVE IT AND SO MY QUESTION IS IS WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL STOP WRITING AND RENEWING HOMEOWNERS POLICIES IN AREAS OF HIGH FIRE RISK MOVING FORWARD SO THAT'S MY QUESTION AND THAT'S SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN WHICH -- -- PEOPLE HAVE CONVEYED MESSAGES TO ME THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION SURE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON -- OUR OUR HOPE IS THAT THE MARKET WILL ATTRACT NEW ENTRANCE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES WHO THEY LOOK AT A COMMUNITY AND FEEL OVER EXPOSED IN BECAUSE IT GEOGRAPHIC OVER OVER CONCENTRATION THEY START EXPRESSING RETICENCE TO ACCEPT A RAMP EVERY APPLICATION AND THE HOPE IS THAT THE MARKET IS HEALTHY ENOUGH TO ATTRACT NEW ENTRANTS INTO THE MARKETPLACE AND IN FACT DOCTOR DIXON STUDY SHOWS THAT IN THE VERY HIGHEST RISK ZIP CODES THERE IS A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE NUMBER OF CARRIERS COMPETING IN THOSE AREAS SO -- MY HOPE IS THAT THE MARKET WILL STAY HEALTHY BUT -- WHAT WE ADVOCATED ALL YEAR WAS LET'S NOT CREATE A CRISIS THAT DOESN'T EXIST WITH LEGISLATION THAT -- THAT TRIGGERS PROBLEMS AND SO WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE ABLE TO REACH ACCOMMODATIONS ON THOSE ELEVEN BILLS THAT MAXIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF COMPANIES STAYING IN THE HIGHEST RISK -- ZIP CODES BUT OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T PROVIDE ANY GUARANTEES FOR ANY SPECIFIC COMPANIES ONE OF THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION HIS UP I'LL JUST ADD REAL QUICK ON THAT -- WE SEE CERTAIN KERRY'S I MEAN IN MY IN MY COMPANY WE'VE GOT A ABOUT A THOUSAND -- RE INSPECTIONS THAT ARE BEING TRIGGERED BY A WILDFIRE OR BRUSH CONCERNS BY INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE SOME OF THOSE WERE WERE THE CLIENTS ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE IT SOME THEY'RE NOT BUT -- AS SOME OF THOSE CLIENTS OR CARRIERS ARE WANTING TO LESSEN THEIR EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN WILDFIRES WE WE STILL ARE SEEN NEW CARRIERS THAT ARE COMING IN THE WRITING SO -- WE'RE NOT SEEN A OF A PROBLEM WITH CAPACITY ON THAT ISSUE THREE THREE QUICKIES ONE -- -- THE ONE GOOD THING AB TWENTY TWO TWO TWO NINE -- THAT REQUIRES INSURERS TO DISCLOSE DISCOUNTS IS IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BEFORE LAST YEAR'S FIRE SEASON I DID A RIDE ALONG IN MORAGA I'M YOUR DISTRICT WITH THE FIRE MARSHALL TO A HOME WHERE THE WHERE ALL SEATED SAID IF YOU DON'T YOU'LL GET MAKE THIS THE LAST RUSH HEAVY AROUND YOUR HOUSE WE'RE GOING TO DROP YOU SO THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO WITH MITIGATION BUT BUT WE DIDN'T WE COULDN'T GET A LOT OF COOPERATION FROM YOUR TEAM ARM ON THE LEGISLATIVE KIND OF STANDARD SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT AT ALL -- TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF INCENTIVES COULD HOMEOWNERS GET TO MAKE THEIR HOMES LESS LIKELY TO BURN THAT KIND OF THING -- LAST FALL AND THERE IS AN INSURANCE FINDER TOOL THAT OUR ORGANIZATION HAS PIONEERED SO YOUR CALL YOUR CONSTITUENTS NEED NOT PANIC AND BECAUSE THERE ARE DEFINITELY LOTS OF OPTIONS LAST VERY LAST -- IT IN CHANGING A POLICY ADDING AN EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST PROVISION TO A HOME POLICY THAT DOUBLES THE COVERAGE IT REALLY IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE SO IF IT ISN'T THAT HARD ON THE HOMEOWNER TO GET BETTER COVERAGE IF THEY'RE WORKING WITH A REALLY GOOD AGENT -- SO IT JUST MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO SHORT DR DIXIT DIX YET IF THE MUSIC UP JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS ON YOUR ON YOUR POINT OF THAT SO WE DID FIND THAT THE MARKET SHARE OF THE SURPLUS LINES CARRIERS IS INCREASING A LITTLE BIT IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS AND YOU KNOW THOSE AREN'T IS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS THE ADMITTED -- CARRIERS -- SO YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AND THE OTHER THING WE DID FIND IS THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS THE FAIR PLAN IS INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE SO THAT TELLS YOU THAT THERE IS SOME YOU KNOW CONCERNS BY THE ADMITTED MARKET EVEN THOUGH THERE'S TURNOVERS AND THERE'S NEW ENTRANTS OVERALL THERE IS SOME CONCERNS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE NOWHERE NEAR THIS IN IN CALIFORNIA BUT YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THE MARKET YOU'RE THE FAIR PLAN WE DON'T WANT TO TURN TURN INTO SOMETHING LIKE HAPPEN IN FLORIDA WHERE YOU HAD A MATH OF -- -- -- -- -- THE YOU KNOW -- FAIR PLAN IN EFFECT COME INTO BEING AND ALL THE THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT COSTS SEVEN NUMBER GIPSON AUG I'LL GET YOU KNOW I'LL ASK THEM OFF LINES I KNOW FOR THE INTEREST OF TIME SENATOR LARA THANK YOU I THINK I I SHOULD JUST ASK ALL MY QUESTIONS AND THEN TO PICK AN ANSWER BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE -- I GUESS I HAVE I HAVE ROUGHLY FOUR QUESTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO ONE FOR MISTER DIXON WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HIGH RISK AREAS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN NOW WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A HIGH RISK AREA IS GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE SO ARE AND AND THIS GIVEN CHANGING CLIMATE AND WE'VE ALWAYS TO WORK ON LEGISLATION TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN DO NEW MODELING TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS A HIGH RISK AREA NOW BECAUSE CLEARLY WHAT WAS A HIGH RISK AREA BEFORE CLEARLY NOT NOW OR IS IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT SOLD OUT FOR -- MISBACH WHAT ROLE SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAY INCITING YOU HOUSING AND HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT -- WHERE SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOLK FOCUS ON A IN TERMS OF BUILDING IN SENSITIVE AREAS WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT -- THE OTHER THING IS -- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE TO FACT THAT -- THE MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED SEEMS TO REALLY TARGET -- THIS ISSUE PROSPECTIVELY HAVE WE DONE ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY SURVIVED -- THESE AS ASTERS NOW -- AND AND WHAT CAN WE DO THE OTHER THING IS AS YOU KNOW WE PASSED LEGISLATION TO -- EXPAND PROTECTIONS TO TWELVE MONTHS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING LOST HER HOME WE'VE ALSO -- HOW TO COLLECT NEW DATA WHEN IT COMES TO FIRE RISK ASSESSMENT IF THAT DATA COMES BACK SAYING THAT -- THIS VIRUS STATE IS BEING USED TO DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO INSURANCE WILL YOU COMMIT TO HELPING US ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OKAY ENOUGH OKAY OFF THEIR -- SO YOU KNOW IT'S FAR AS HIGH RISK AREAS OF REALLY GOOD QUESTION WHAT WE DID IS WE LOOK WE LOOK AT -- WILD FAR MODELS -- AND LOOK AT THE PERCENT OF ACRES IN EACH THE BURN AND THEN COMBINE THAT WITH ESTIMATES OF WHERE THE POPULATION IS TO DETERMINE THE YOU KNOW THE EXPECTED AVERAGE THAT NUMBER OF STRUCTURES EXPECTED TO BURN IN ANY GIVEN YEAR SO THAT WAS A THE MEASURE OF HIGH RISK VERSUS LOW RISK AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN THINK OF THE LOW RISK ONES AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE CHANGING BUT YOU KNOW AND VERY DENSELY URBAN OUR URBAN AREAS YOU KNOW WILD FIRES NOT A RISK AND YOU KNOW TO THE ISSUES RELATED EMBERS AND ALL THAT SO THOSE ARE OUR LOW RISK AREAS IN THE HIGHER ONES ARE IN THE YOU KNOW THE THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE THE OTHER PART OF OUR STUDY WAS TO LOOK AT HOW THOSE -- THOSE HIGH WILD WILD FIRE RISK AREAS ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE END OF THE CENTURY -- USING THE DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS AND WE FOUND LIKE IN THE AREAS ABOVE THIS YEAR OF SACRAMENTO AND THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS DID THE EXPECTED NUMBER OF PERCENT OF ACRES TO BURN DISAFFECTED TO DOUBLE BY MID CENTURY AND THEN DOUBLED AGAIN BY THE -- THE END OF THE CENTURY SO THOSE ARE -- YOU KNOW BIG NUMBERS AND GOING -- MAJOR ISSUE FOR THE STATE TO DEAL WITH AND JUST AS A SIDE ALSO IMPORT -- POINTS OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFORTS TO CONTROL CARBON EMISSIONS THAT WILL THAT CAN REDUCE THAT THAT AFFECT THIS BALK OKAY -- SO ON OUR WHAT CAN LOCAL OFFICIALS DO LET'S START THERE -- CERTAINLY ENFORCE BUILDING CODES WHICH IS EASIER SAID THAN DONE I KNOW YOU KNOW CINEMA COUNTY AND NAPA COUNTY YEAH YOU HAVE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A CONFLICT YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP PEOPLE REBUILD BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY BUILD SAFE AND SO BUT THEY DO SO WE DO NEED TO ENFORCE OUR BUILDING BECAUSE I YOU KNOW LIMIT DEVELOPMENT IN STE NEW CONSTRUCTION IN SENSITIVE AREAS I MEAN I THINK TO A DEGREE THE INSURANCE MARKET DOES -- DOES HELP BY YOU KNOW BY APPROPRIATELY -- AND CHARGING FOR YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING A HIGHER RISK WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY'RE DOING IT FAIRLY BUT WE DO HAVE A PRETTY HARDY REGULATORY REGIME INSURERS CAN COME IN ANYTIME THEY WANT FOR A RATE INCREASE REQUEST SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME CAP THERE -- AT THE TWO THE TWO ISSUES THAT I KNOW WE'RE GONNA NEED MORE COOPERATION FROM FROM INSURERS ON -- ALIY IN THIS AREA JUST LIVING EXPENSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE NOT THAT NEW EVEN THEIR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS -- ISN'T GONNA GET TO GET THEM THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BE BACK HOME -- AND I AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE AGAIN WE'RE GONNA CALL ON INSURERS TO WORK WITH THEIR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND YOU KNOW JUST JUST TO JUST TO REFUTE YOU KNOW REX'S AYE IT'S A CASUAL IDEA THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF PROOF THAT YOU WERE MISLED AND IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO PEOPLE HAVE TO GET EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS THIS COMMUNICATION OF PEOPLE HARDLY EVER DO SO THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY GET THEIR POLICIES REFORM TO BE WHERE THEY WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE A VERY SMALL SET SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO ROCKY LESLIE SAVE THESE TAX IN THESE LETTERS MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE HE SAID SHE SAID AND I WANT TO SPONSORS AND LARA QUESTION SURE SURE I'M SO YEAH JUST SO EXTENDING A LEAVE FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS IF PEOPLE CAN SHOW THAT THEY USE DEL DUE DILIGENCE AND COULDN'T GET BACK IN AND THEN WE STILL HAVE A BIG ISSUE COMING DOWN THE PIKE WITH THE DEBRIS REMOVAL BILLS OKAY MISTER FRAZIER CENTER LARA'S HERE RETROACTIVE IMPACT WE SAW A LOT OF THOSE BILLS THIS YEAR -- WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT PRICES ARE BASED ON WHAT THE LAW IS THAT THE TIME YOU MAKE YOUR RATE FILING AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CHANGES THE RULES TO LET'S SAY ADD ADDITIONAL POLICY -- EXPENSES THAT WE WOULD PAY -- AT THAT POINT ONCE WE REFLECT THOSE THEN WILL COME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ASK FOR RATE INCREASES TO COVER THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS -- BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE NOTION THAT WHEN OUR RATES ARE BUILT ON A CERTAIN BODY OF LAW THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD COME ALONG AND THEN RETROACTIVELY CHANGE THE LAW TO ADD ADD ADD COSTS WITHOUT THAT BEING INCLUDED IN THE RATE FILINGS AS TO UNDERWRITING UNDERWRITING IS REALLY A TOOL THAT INSURERS MUST USE WHEN THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GET ADEQUATE RATE WHEN -- WHEN A A RATE -- PLAN APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN A CERTAIN AREA LET'S SAY -- WOULDN'T ALLOW THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO GET ADEQUATE PRICE YOU CAN'T CONTINUE JUST TO OPERATE AS BUSINESS AS USUAL SO YOU START USING -- UNDERWRITING TOOLS POSSIBLY NON RENEW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RICH THAT THAT LOWER RISK MATCHES THE INADEQUATE PRICING OF THE AREA THAT'S THE STRUGGLE -- THAT THAT COMPANIES FACE AND OBVIOUSLY WITH RATE ADEQUACY IT'S A LOT EASIER TO WRITE IN EVERY COMMUNITY WHERE THE ONLY THING YOU'RE MANAGING AT THAT POINT IS GEOGRAPHIC OVER CONCENTRATION CENTER LARA YOU GET THANKS FOR THOSE GOOD QUESTIONS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON THANK YOU SENATOR AND CHAIR I -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE AND HAVE FOR THIS HEARING AND AND WHILE WE'RE HERE -- HOWEVER THE WILD FIRES THAT WE HAVE CAN'T BE SILENT INTO JUST A CONFLICT BETWEEN HOMEOWNERS AND POLICY OF PROVIDERS THERE ARE SO MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO ON A STATE LEVEL WITH FIRE MANAGEMENT AS FAR AS FORCED -- MANAGEMENT AND LAND MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE LOCAL POLICIES SO I DON'T NEED AN ANSWER TODAY WHAT I WILL DO IS THROW THIS OUT CHAU AND SHARE WITH YOU THE INTEREST THAT I HAVE IN MY OFFICE WHAT WILL BE PURSUING AND WHAT WAS MENTIONED BY MISBACH WAS THAT WE HAVE THE LAWS WERE JUST NOT ENFORCING THEM AND -- THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED ABOUT WHEN WE HAD THE DISASTER YOU AT A TABLE OUT THERE -- THAT'S GREAT AND THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT NOT ALL THE VICTIMS COULD MAKE IT TO YOUR TABLE AND SO I THINK THE ONE THING I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN IS MAKING SURE THAT PRIOR TO A DISASTER -- POLICY HOLDERS PROPERTY OWNERS ARE AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY ARE AWARE OF RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THEM WHETHER IT BE FEMUR ANYTHING ELSE PRIOR TO RATHER THAN WAITING TILL AFTER THE DISASTER AND THINGS ARE A BIT AWRY THE OTHER THING I'M REALLY REALLY FOCUSED AND INTERESTED IN AND POSSIBLY IF YOU DID WANT TO RESPOND MISTER THERE -- ON HOW OFTEN ARE POLICIES REVIEWED AND HOW OFTEN ARE THE UPDATED TO ASSURE THAT SOMEONE HAS ADEQUATE INSURANCE -- I WOULD SAY ON ON OUR COMMERCIAL POLICIES -- AND WE WERE REVIEWING THOSE LIMITS WITH WITH THOSE POLICY HOLDERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- ON THE HOMEOWNER'S POLICIES -- YOU KNOW OUR POLICY IS TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW EVERY THREE YEARS -- SO -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THE CLIENTS GET A REVIEW MORE OFTEN THAN THAT BASED ON -- THERE NEED THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING FOR THAT BUT -- YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY EVERY THREE YEARS AS YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SITTING DOWN AND WE'RE ASKING OUR OUR AGENTS TO SIT DOWN AND AND LOOK LOOK AT THESE -- LIMITS WITH WITH SO POSSIBLY I NEED TO -- -- SEEK SOME HELP THEM BECAUSE I'VE HAD ONE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND NEVER HAD A I WOULD I WOULD BE REVIEW AND CONTACT THE VETERAN TO SEND THE NEED FOR GRAYSON AYE AYE AYE OH SORRY I I I I JUST WANTED TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN WHICH WAS PASSED THIS YEAR TO REQUIRE -- A AND A PROVISION OF IT REPLACEMENT COST ESTIMATE EVERY TWO YEARS ON THE LOT THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED JUST HAVE A COUPLE MOTHER QUESTION SO AS CELLULAR GRACIE YOU'RE GOOD OKAY SENATOR GALGIANI AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY -- SENATOR MORE LOG SORT OF TOUCHED IN THE SPACE A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AND I I WANTED TO THROW THIS OUT SPECIFICALLY TO MR FRAZIER -- AND OF THE BUILDER COMMUNITY AND THEY MORTGAGE COMMUNITY MY DISTRICT -- HAPPENS TO BE IN A A FLAT OUT HEY THE EXPOS FLAT AREA HAVE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF DELTA LEVEES -- THAT GOES FROM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN TWENTY YEARS AGO WE HAD A MASSIVE FLOOD AND MASSIVE DAMAGE AND THE SENSE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSY I'LL BUT IT SET UP NEW STANDARDS FOR TWO HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD PLAIN AREAS WHERE BY ANY BUILDER GOING INTO AN AREA INTO ONE OF THOSE DESIGNATED AREAS MUST MEETS CERTAIN HIGHER STANDARDS -- BEFORE THEY CAN GET APPROVED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND THERE'S A TIME LINE THAT'S ATTACHED WITH THAT YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT REMEMBER IT WAS SB FIVE BY SENATOR MACHADO AM AND AGAIN IT'S BEEN CONTROVERSY BECAUSE THERE BEEN SOME SOME PROBLEMS WITH IT IT GETS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL PROPERTY OWNERS WHAT THEY CAN DO AND CAN'T DO WITH THEIR PROPERTY BUT CAO FIRED DOES KEEP -- MAPS OF THEIRS THEY CALL THEM THEIR STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS THERE AS R. A.'S OF THE VERY HIGH RISK WITH THE THE CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT -- THEY DIDN'T SET OUT TO INTENTIONALLY BY HOME IN A FLOOD PLAIN -- THEY TRUSTED OTHERS WHO ENCOURAGED THEM TO BUY WHETHER IT'S THAT THE THE BUILDER THE -- REAL ESTATE AGENTS TO ENSURE WHOEVER WOULD BE THEY JUST TRUSTED THAT WELL THIS IS ON THE MARKET AND AND I'M GONNA BUY THIS HOME BECAUSE I WANTED -- I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO HAVING DISCUSSION AMONG THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE BUILDING INDUSTRY MORTGAGE INDUSTRY ABOUT TAKING A LOOK AT THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS AND REALLY LOOKING AT YOU KNOW DO WE NEED TO SET UP SOME SOME REQUIREMENTS SIMILAR TO WHAT'S BEEN DEAD FOR DONE FOR FLOOD AREAS THAT ACTUALLY FEMALE WAS INVOLVED WITH AS WELL AS AT A CONVERSATION IT'S BEEN STARTED OR THOUGHT ABOUT I'M I'M NOT A AWARE OF THAT WHERE THERE WOULD BE TO SIGN UNDERSTAND YEAH -- THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME ENFORCER WEATHER WOULD BE I GUESS SOME STATE AGENCY THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MANDATE THE PURCHASE OF INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN FOLKS IS THAT IS THAT THE BECAUSE CERTAINLY IN LAKE COUNTY THAT WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO THEY INHERITED THEIR HOMES THEY WERE PAID OFF THERE'S NO BANK THEY'RE REQUIRING A NOTE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS -- TO WAY TOO MANY FOLKS WHO JUST COMPLETELY LOST THEIR HOME INSURANCE WE I MAYBE I UNDERSTOOD IT TO ASK ABOUT AN EQUIVALENT OF THE FLOOD MAPPING PROGRAM FOR FIRE RISK OKAY AND SO IF YOU DON'T MIND I I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT WE DO HAVE IN FACT WHEN I I HAD A NOTE HERE TO ASK LLOYD AND A YOU KNOW IS THERE A UNIFORM STANDARD FOR HIGH RISK I THINK ASKED FOR THE SAME QUESTION AND I JUST WANT TO THE POINT OF INFORMATION TO SHARE IF THE IF IF ALL OF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS BUT THE GOVERNOR CREATE A TASK TASK FORCE ON TREE MORTALITY A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO RIGHT AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT WHAT WE GONNA DO WITH THE HUNDRED MILLION DEAD TREES FROM THE BARK BEETLE INFESTATION BUT THEN IT THEN A THEN BECAUSE IN A LOT OF THESE AREAS THE INSURANCE MARKET WAS CHANGING AND PEOPLE WERE GETTING ON RENEWED ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AND AND SO THERE AN INSURANCE SUB GROUP -- GREW OUT OF THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE IT'S KIND OF -- I REALLY MORE OF ONE BUT IT'S IT'S SORT OF ON HOLD RIGHT NOW AND I JUST SPOKE TO A SUPERVISOR DOWN AMERICA COUNTY ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD TRY TO RENEW IT BECAUSE THE FOCUS THERE WAS WOULDN'T BE GREAT IN TERMS OF OF DEVELOPING MITIGATION STANDARDS DISCOUNT SUPPORT -- AND BEST PRACTICES WITH WITH FORESTRY MANAGER AND ALL THAT THAT WE THAT WE CONTINUE THIS WORK WITH INSURERS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH CAL FIRE BECAUSE THERE REALLY ISN'T A STANDARD THERE'S I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S A HIGH RISK -- CLASSIFICATION THAT EVERYONE WOULD AGREE WITH I THINK THE IN THE INSURANCE PROBABLY A LOT OF THEM USE THEIR OWN WAY OF DEFINING AND I KNOW THAT -- THAT THERE'S WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S EFFECTIVE IN SAVING HOMES IN THE AFTERMATH OF A WILDFIRE COMPARED TO FLOOD WE HAVE A LOT MORE THERE'S A LOT MORE STRATEGIES YOU CAN USE THAT WE KNOW WORK YOU KNOW WITH WILDFIRE WE STILL HAVE YOU KNOW THE THE -- SCREENS TO KEEP EMBERS WERE FLYING BACK AND YOU CAN DO THAT ROOF VENT -- SCREENS YOU'VE GOT THE THE PHONE AND THAT OF COURSE REPLACING RUSE BUT THEY'RE STILL -- YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE SOME WORK TO DO -- BUT I THINK TRYING TO GET SOME CLEAR STANDARDS I THINK A MAPPING IDEAS GREAT -- IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT AND DO IT THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE MAPS THAT ARE OUT THERE THE CPC'S BEEN WORKING FOR I I BELIEVE THE LAST TEN YEARS ON UPDATING THEIR MAPS CAL FIRE HAS BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THAT I THINK THE CRITICISM YOU'LL HEAR OF OF THE EXISTING A HIGH FIRE SEVERITY MAPS IS THAT LACKS NGUYEN DATA JUST THERE'S NEVER BEEN THE COMPUTING POWER IN ORDER TO PUT THAT TOGETHER -- THE BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE START UPS AND SILICON VALLEY THAT ARE TRYING TO BUILD A BETTER MOUSE TRAP IN THOSE THOSE MODELS WILL GET BETTER OVER TIME AND THE CPC CERTAINLY IS IS PRESSING FOR THAT OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY ON THAT LAST QUESTION OUR EIGHT GENERAL QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU FEEL THE -- RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE DISCLOSURE FORM IS WORKING AT OF COURSE CAME OUT OF THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE NICK PREFERS LOST HIS HOME IN IS THREE THOUSAND VOLUME LIBRARY THINKCENTRE NICK PETROUS LOST A HOME IN OAKLAND HILLS WE HAVE THE DISCLOSURE FORM WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHERE IN THE COLD WE TALK ABOUT DEMAND SURGE CHANGES IN BUILDING CODES IT DEALS WITH ACTUAL CASH VALUE COVERAGE REPLACEMENT COST COVERAGE SO THERE IS A DISCLOSURE THE PEOPLE SUPPOSED TO GET THE DETAILS OF WHAT TYPE OF -- COVERAGE THEY'VE GOT WHICH DEALS WITH THE ADEQUACY ISSUE OR NOT BUYING INSURANCE THEIR ACTION OBVIOUSLY NOT GETTING THAT DISCLOSURE WHICH WAS START EDUCATING THEM BUT JUST ANY COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THAT SCHEME OF THE -- COVERAGE DISCLOSURE THAT IS CURRENTLY A PART OF OUR LAW AND THEN RELATED TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS ANY UPDATED COMMENTS ON THOSE MY ONLY COMMENT ON THAT IS I JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE READING IT I MEAN EIGHTY I GUESS EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT LOST HOMES OR HAVE SMOKE DAMAGE CLAIMS IN THIS THIS EVENT DIDN'T DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT WHAT THEIR COVERAGE WAS SO -- IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THESE THINGS BUT IF IF IT'S NOT -- IF PEOPLE ARE TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO TO READ WHAT THEY'RE BUYING AND -- AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT -- THAT THAT STUFF FOR TO ADD TO THAT I THINK -- YOU KNOW I'M A LAWYER I SO I YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE LOOKED AT THE HISTORY OF THE LAW AND YOU GAVE SOME GOOD OUT OF IN THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS FOR THE HEARING OF OF THE EVERY CASE AND WHICH BASICALLY HAS HAS BEEN IN MY OPINION LOOKING AT THIS FOR A LONG TIME I THINK THE FACT THAT ULTIMATELY -- THE INSURER AND ITS PRODUCER OR DO NOT HAVE A -- AS A TO A DUTY TO ADEQUATELY ENSURE AT LEAST THE COURTS HAVE NOT WANTED TO HIM THAT ON THE SELLER TO SAY OKAY IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO SELL SOMEBODY INSURANCE YOU GOT TO SELL THEM INSURANCES TAILORED FOR THEIR PROPERTY THE COURTS HAVE NOT WANTED TO GO THERE BUT I HONESTLY THINK THAT THE FACT THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVEN'T GONE THERE IS WHY THE PROBLEM KEEPS GOING BECAUSE I THINK AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT THIS COMPETITION AND YOU KNOW BETWEEN CARRIERS ARE GONNA YOU KNOW YOU AND AND BECAUSE TOTAL LOSSES ARE RARE AS LONG AS THE CARRIER AND ITS AGENTS KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE HELD LIABLE UNLESS THE PERSON HAS THIS INCREDIBLE QUANTUM OF PROOF WHICH HARDLY ANYONE HAS THAT THEY WERE MISINFORMED MOST OF THE TIME THE CUSTOMER LOSES SO I THINK THAT IS A REALITY I KNOW THIS BODY IS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT CREATING A NEW CAUSE OF ACTION BUT I HAVE TO SAY -- WE'VE TRIED ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE OKAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY YOU'RE GOOD GUY UNLESS THERE'S FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR COMING AND SHARING THEIR THOUGHTS AND INSIGHTS WE'RE GONNA MOVE NEXT TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND SO IF YOU'RE HERE AND WOULD LIKE TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE A PODIUM TO THE RIGHT HE HERE AND YOU'D LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT TO OUR JOINT COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME STAND UP BEHIND THE PODIUM AND WE'LL GIVE EACH OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS -- AS THE PANEL -- LIKE THIS FINISHES UP HERE OKAY SO FOR PUBLIC COMMENT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO TRY TO GET YOU IF YOU LET US KNOW WHO WE ARE -- THAT WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND LIKE TO ASK YOU TO CONSOLIDATE YOUR COMMENTS IF YOU CAN INTO A MINUTE OR TWO SO WE CAN HAVE AT THE TIME FOR EVERYONE TO WATCH PROVIDE THEIR TESTIMONY TO US THIS MORNING SO WELCOME COME ON UP AND THEN AT A GO YEAH WE ARE READY TO GO IT IS A GENTLEMAN THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS MEETING BY THE WAY IT'S AND I LOST OUR HOME ON THE -- TUBS FIRE OCTOBER NINTH TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE LOST OUR HOME OR PERSONAL PROPERTY AND ARE PROOF OF LIFE TOOK AS A MOTHER TO CERTAINLY AFTER CHRISTMAS BUT TO GATHER OURSELVES UP TO PURCHASE CLOTHES SHOES POTS AND PANS THINGS TO LIVE ON AND FIND A PLACE TO LIVE SOON AFTER CHRISTMAS WE REALIZED THROUGH TALKING WITH NEIGHBORS LAWYERS FRIENDS OF MINE CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS AND ALSO ATTENDING THE UNITED POLICY HOLDER MEETINGS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ME BOX FOR THAT WE REALIZED THAT WE WERE UNDERINSURED BUT WE WERE JUST UNDERINSURED WE WERE SEVERELY UNDERINSURED WE JUST PURCHASED OUR HOUSE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE FOUNTAIN GROVE AREA OF SANTA ROSA NOW YOU WOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE PROPERLY INSURED JUST BE TWO YEARS BEFORE THE FIRE BUT WE WEREN'T I HAD TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF IT THROUGH -- A LOT OF SOURCES ONE OF THOSE WAS IN NORTH BAY BUILDERS EXCHANGE REALIZING THAT THE PER SQUARE FOOT BUILDING COST IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND AREA AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE WAS PROMISED ME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT YOU'VE HEARD HIGHER FIGURES OF THAT TODAY GOING ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE RIGHT NOW THAT COST IS GOING TO GO WHAT MY HOUSE WAS INSURED FOR TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED WE JUST PURCHASED OUR HOUSE TWO YEARS BEFORE THE FIRE I TALK TO MY AGENT WHO WE ARE NOT TALKING WE'RE NOT TALKING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE'S A BAND TO ME TWICE IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE HE THINKS HE'S GONNA GET SUED SO WE STOPPED TALKING TO ME BUT WHEN WE WERE TALKING I ASKED HIM HOW CONGRESO UNDERINSURED HE THOUGHT WE WERE PROPERLY INSURED I TOLD HIM THAT WE WERE NOT HE SAID THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES INSURED UNDERINSURED YOU ON PURPOSE I SAID WHY DID THEY DO THAT THAT DEFEATS ITS PURPOSE BECAUSE IF THEY REALLY HONORED SURE YOU THE BE A LOT OF LAWSUITS AND THEY GONNA HAVE TO PAY OVER AND ABOVE THE POLICY HE SAYS NO IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY THE UNDERINSURED BECAUSE NINETY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE WILL NOT FIGHT THEM WILL NOT RESIST THEM THEY WILL WALK THEY WILL GIVE UP I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT I'M NOT GIVEN WE'VE GONE THROUGH FROM THIS BOX ORGANIZATION AND LEARNING THROUGH HER MEETINGS THAT THERE IS A PROCESS CALLED THE REFORMATION PROCESSES REFORMATION A POLICY AND COVERAGES THIS THIS IS A POLICY OR THIS IS -- AN ACTION THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN TAKE TO AWARD YOU YOUR COVERAGES ABOVE AND BE ON YOUR POLICY LIMITS IF THEY FIND THAT THEY HAVE MADE MISTAKES AND WANT TO OWN UP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES I'VE BEEN THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND SINCE EARLY MARCH IN MAY THEY ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS AN AGENT BIDDING AIR WHATEVER THAT MEANS IT MEANS THAT THE AGENT MADE A MISTAKE HE DIDN'T COME OUT TO MY HOUSE AND MEASURE THE SQUARE FOOT IS ALTHOUGH HE WAS OUT THERE SOCIALLY AND SO MANY THINGS EVEN HELP ME PUT UP THE OUTSIDE THE BACKYARD STRUCTURE HE KNEW WHAT WE HAD YOU SAW WE HAD ANY SONG ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF JUST A MATERIAL COSTS OF IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT HOUSE FOR THE TWO YEARS THAT I OWN THE HOUSE THAT I'VE WORKED ON EVERY SINGLE DAY I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS INSURED FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH WAS LESS THAN MINE WE WENT THROUGH THE REFORMATION PROCESS THEY ADMITTED THEIR MISTAKE THEY ADDED TO MY COVERAGE J. WHICH YOUR IS YOUR BUILDING COST OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY WERE STILL APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SHORT OF WHAT WAS GOING TO TAKE TO REBUILD AT THAT TIME I TOLD HIM THAT WAS WHOLLY INADEQUATE AND THAT I WOULD PROVE TO THEM THROUGH A BUILDER OR TWO THAT I WOULD GET THOSE CONTRACTORS ESTIMATES TO THEM AND I WOULD SHOW YOU THE REAL COST OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST TO REBUILD MY HOME IN SANTA ROSA THAT WAS DONE BY A VERY GOOD AND KNOWLEDGEABLE PROFESSIONAL THROUGH A COUPLE OF BUILDERS IT'S GOING TO COST ABOUT APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO REPLACE MY HOUSE MY HOUSE WITH A SOUL FOR APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE I HAD APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WITH MY WIFE AND I INVENTORY FOR ABOUT TOO MUCH EVERY SINGLE DAY OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED LINES INTO EXCEL PROGRAM THEY JUST TURNED DOWN MY SECOND REQUEST THE THEY HAD A PERSONAL BECAUSE WHICH WE CALL A MINI A MINI REFORMATION BUT THEY JUST TURNED ME DOWN LAST THURSDAY ON THE SECOND REQUEST FOR A PROPER AND TRUE REFORMATION OF POLICIES BECAUSE THIS IS A SWAM DARK I'VE HAD LAWYERS BEG ME FOR THEM TO REPRESENT ME ON CONTINGENCY BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A SLAM DUNK I TOLD FARMERS INSURANCE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS PLEASE DON'T BE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH I DO NOT WANT TO SUE YOU I DO NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME RIGHT NOW MY WIFE AND I ARE REFUGEES IN THE NORTH BAY WE'VE LOST OUR JOBS AND THIS INSURANCE THING IN THIS FIRE IS A FULL TIME JOB AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR A YEAR SO THE TERM IT DOWN LAST THURSDAY I SIGNED THE CONTRACTS ON SATURDAY TO SUE THEM I A COUPLE VERY GOOD LAWYERS AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL TURN OUT WELL THE WORD A PROTRACTED BATTLE SO I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TODAY FROM A FIRE CASUALTY WILL CALL MYSELF A VICTIM BECAUSE I AM NOT PART OF THE NINETY PERCENT THAT'S NOT GOING TO FIGHT ON THE PART OF THE TEN THAT'S GOING TO FIND I'M GOING TO WIN AND I INTEND TO GO TO THE MEDIA AFTER THIS TO IT'S PART OF MY CAMPAIGN NOW ON THE FORMER MARINE OFFICER I FIGURE I'M IN A BATTLE I'M STEPPING OVER THE LINE OF DEPARTURE AND AND I'M IN A FIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE FLIGHT AT THAT THANK YOU ONE MORE TIME OF ONE MORE THING I'M NOT JUST HERE TO STATE THIS SOMEONE ASK YOU SOMETHING SO I'M IN A LAWSUIT NOW I AM GOING TO BE GOING TO THE MEDIA BUT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSE THE LOSS OF USE WHICH IS A TWO YEAR -- COMPANIES PROVIDE WE DO NEED AN EXTENSION ON THAT I'VE ASKED MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO EXTEND THAT TO A THIRD YEAR OR MAYBE MORE BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE LAST YEAR'S BEEN A WASTE OF TIME HAS BEEN A WASTE OF TIME IT'S BEEN A LOSS OF TIME WE STILL HAVEN'T STARTED YET WE CANNOT BUILD OUR HOUSE WE CANNOT ALONG UNTIL DON'T HOUSE AND I CANNOT BY OUR HOUSE IN OUR AREA WE ARE RIGHT NOW REFUGEE STATUS FLOODING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TODAY AND IF YOU CAN ADD THE ELITE OF ANYTHING BUT ALSO TAKE NOTE I AM JUST ONE OF MANY MANY OF MY FRIENDS ARE ALSO HAVING TO SUE MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR ANOTHER PERSON HERE NOW BUT WE ARE GOING THROUGH IT WHICH WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO AND BY THE WAY HOW DID MY INSURANCE AGENT INSURE ME FOR TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE FIRE WHEN THE ACTUAL BUILDING COSTS WAS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT HOW DID THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE ONE MORE THING I'M A GUY THAT WAS WORKING THREE JOBS OUT THERE I WAS WORKING TWELVE FOURTEEN HOURS A DAY WHEN THE BILL'S CAME IN I WROTE CHECKS I'M NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT THE FINE PRINT BECAUSE WHEN HE TOLD ME I WAS PROPERLY INSURED AND EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE GOOD TO GO IF THERE WAS A FIRE I TRUSTED HIM I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE PER SQUARE FOOT BUILDING COST WAS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD -- AREA AND YOU KNOW WHAT MOST OF US DON'T IN THIS FOR THE LAST THE GENTLEMAN'S TALKED ABOUT WHAT THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON BUILDING OUT THERE IT WAS SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THE TUBS FIRE ARE UNDERINSURED THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON TALK TO ON THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT THEIR CLAIMS THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE MONEY THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL THEY FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH SEVERAL ON HOLD BECAUSE OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND HERE'S THE STATEMENT WE CAN HANDLE THE FIRE WE CAN HANDLE THE LOS WE CAN'T HANDLE THE INSURANCE COMPANY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME PIZZA GOOD AFTERNOON AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA FOLLOW THAT BUT I AM STACY HEATING FROM THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA RC RC WE REPRESENT THIRTY SIX ROLE COUNTIES STATEWIDE INCLUDING NAPA MENDOCINO LAKE AND NOW CINEMA THEY JUST JOINED US IN SEPTEMBER WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF STORIES LIKE THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS ARE OVER THE LAST NOT JUST SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES BUT ALSO ON PREVIOUS FIRE SUCH AS THE VALLEY FIRE IN LAKE COUNTY AND THE BUTTE FIRE IN CALAVERAS AND AMADOR COUNTY AND NOW WE'VE HAD THE CAR FIRE THAT DESTROYED MORE THAN A THOUSAND HOMES UP IN THE SHASTA COUNTY AREA AS WELL AS THE FERGUSON FIRE IN THE MEDICINAL COMPLEX FIRE THIS YEAR SO THESE FIRES ARE GOING AWAY THESE HIGH SEVERITY FIRES ARE GOING AWAY AND WE ALSO HAVE A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DEAD TREES STILL DOWN IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL SIERRAS WHERE WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF INSURANCE ISSUES COMING FROM THOSE HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE BEING CANCELLED THE NON RENEWED AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING THOSE STORIES FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND WE REALIZE THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE WE'VE BEEN SPENDING THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY -- BOTH INDEPENDENTLY AND THROUGH THE STATE'S TRIMMER TALLY TASK FORCE -- BOTH RC RC AND OUR MEMBER COUNTIES WE ARE TRYING TO GEAR UP TO CONTINUE THOSE DISCUSSIONS THROUGH THE NEWLY FORMED FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY NOT BEEN AS PRODUCTIVE AS WE WOULD LIKE WE HOPE TO MAKE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE SO WE CAN HOPEFULLY TACKLE SOME OF THESE ISSUES WITHOUT HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GO BACK TO LEGISLATION BUT WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF YOUR TO COMMITTEES AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO THAT MY BOARDS CONSTITUENTS CAN IMPROVE THEIR COVERAGE REBUILD THEIR HOMES AND THOSE THAT ARE STILL LIVING OUT IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WHICH AS WE KNOW IS A GREATER AREA OF THE STATE EVERY YEAR CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THEIR COVERAGE OPTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU HI EVERYONE MY NAME THIRTY FELL CAM INSURANCE BROKER BUT IN THE BUSINESS ALMOST THIRTY YEARS HOW YOU DOING -- I'VE HEARD QUESTIONS AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU MY OPINION AND MY BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS AN INSURANCE AGENT I REPRESENT AS A BROKER REPRESENT BOTH SIDES ARE REPRESENT THE CONSUMER AND I REPRESENT THE COMPANY TO ALWAYS SIT IN THE MIDDLE AND I DON'T LIKE CONSUMERS RIPPING OUT THE COMPANY AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE COMPANIES RIPPING OFF THE CONSUMER AND IT'S MY JOB TO DO MY BEST TO FIGHT FOR EITHER THE PARTY'S DEPENDING WHO I FEEL IS THE RIGHT DOING THE RIGHT THING SO THE THING I WANT TO SAY IS WHAT CHANGES CAN YOU GUYS DO LEGISLATIVELY ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD CONSIDER FOR YOU GUYS TO MAYBE CONSIDER MAYBE EVEN WRITING DOWN BECAUSE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WAY I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A CHANGE IS NUMBER ONE YOU HEARD A GUY TESTIMONY TODAY THAT COULD CAUSE AN EXTRA HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH BUILDING CODE UPGRADES WELL MOST INSURANCE POLICIES HAVE A STANDARD FOR BACK UP TEN PERCENT IF YOU'RE SURE HOUSE FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A TEN PERCENT THAT'S THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT COMES WAY SHORT I THINK THE STANDARD DRAWBACKS A BABY BE TWENTY FIVE THIRTY PERCENT SO WE SHOULD CONSIDER HAVING MINIMUMS IT WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING GOT CAUGHT UP GREAT SO WE CAN COVERED A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND MAKE IT A STANDARD PART OF A POLICY -- IT'S GOING TO COST VERY LITTLE SECOND THING I WOULD LOOK AT IS I WILL LOOK AT POLICIES WE COMES TO LEADING COMPANIES THEN THE COMPANIES A LOT OF TIMES HE GAVE AN EXAMPLE GUIDES PAYING THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR FINE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A HOUSE ASKEW'S BEFORE PIECE OF PROPERTY BUT THE HOUSE IS WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAH THAT HAPPENS AND YES IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN TO AN INSURED THAT WE DON'T INSURE WHAT YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE FOR WILSHIRE WOULD COST TO REBUILD THE HOUSE BUT A LOT OF TIMES THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE YOU COULD SPEND EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY AND THE HOUSE IS ONLY WORTH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT TRY EXPLAINING THAT TO THE LENDER WHO WANTS IS TO COVER THE LOAN SO IT WORKS BOTH WAYS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDUSTRY LOOK AT THE LENDING INDUSTRY AS WELL BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH HOW PEOPLE ARE SHORT ANOTHER THING THEY PROVIDE REPORTS TODAY WHEN YOU BUY A PIECE OF PROPERTY I THINK IT'S REQUIRED BY LAW IF YOU BUY A PIECE OF PROPERTY TO THE HOME THAT IF YOU'RE IN A FLOOD PLAIN YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED THEIR DISCLOSURES AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT INSURANCE IS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KEN COOLEY RIGHT BUT SEE WHY CAN'T THESE PEOPLE WHO REPORT THESE NOMINEES BASED ON WHERE YOUR HOME IS SAY HEY YOU'RE BUYING A HOME IN A FIRE HAZARD ZONE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THESE HOUSES CAN'T SEE LATER HEY I WAS UNDER SURE BECAUSE YOU KNEW THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE GETTING YOU KNEW YOU WERE GETTING A HOUSE IN THE FOOT PAIN SO I THINK THAT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT BECAUSE AS FAR AS MAPPING IS CONCERNED THREE YEARS AGO I STARTED NOTICING THAT ALL THE CARRIERS THAT I USED TO USE THAT WOULD COVER PEOPLE THAT WERE IF FIRE AREAS STARTED BACKING UP THEY WERE BRAGGING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN COME TO US BECAUSE WE ARE SURE PROTECTION CLASS TEN PROTECTION CLASS IS WHAT WE USED TO USE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT THE RISK FACTORS WERE FOR THE HOMES SO WITH SOMEONE WITHIN THE EIGHT NINE OR TEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO GO TO A SPECIALTY COMPANY OR COMPANY THAT TOOK ON THOSE RISKS THOSE SAME COMPANIES TODAY THEY WON'T TOUCH PROP THOSE PROPERTIES AT THE PROTECTION CLASS CAN STILL BE A TEN BUT WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES IS WHAT'S CALLED MAPPING SO THE THING ABOUT MAPS IN WHO IS IN A FIRE PROTECTION CLASS I COULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW INSURANCE COMPANIES THEY KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE SECOND I PUT IT ADDRESS INTO THE COMPUTER IT'S GOING TO TELL ME THAT PERSON CAN GET IS IF THAT PERSON QUALIFY TO GET INSURANCE WITH THAT CARRIER NOT BECAUSE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE PROTECTION CLASSES WERE BASING YOUR FIGHT APARTMENT AT THEIR FULL TIME IF THEY CAN BE THERE WITHIN THREE MINUTES IF YOU'RE WITHIN FIVE MILES AWAY IF YOU GOT TO HIDE WITHIN IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU COULD GET A DECENT RIGHT BUT NOW DOESN'T REALLY MATTER ANYMORE BECAUSE SOMEBODY WHO DRAW UP A MAP IT SAYS YOU GOT TOO MANY TREES AROUND YOU CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT TREES AND THE LOOK BUT CALIFORNIA TREES I UNDERSTAND ARE DESIGNED TO BURN EVERY FEW YEARS WHERE STATE THAT BASICALLY BURNS ITSELF EVERY FEW YEARS SO IT'S JUST WHERE WE LIVE SO WHY CAN'T WE MAKE THOSE MAPS AVAILABLE SO THAT THESE GUYS THESE REPORTS HE SAID YOU'RE IN A FLOOD ZONE OR YOU'RE IN A FIRE HAS ITS OWN SO PEOPLE HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH SO THEY CAN'T OPEN NOTICE A LATER ADDED NO OKAY SO BUILDING CODES SHOULD BE HIGHER AS FAR AS THE STANDARD THE OTHER THING IS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT RATES A LOT OF TIME SOMEBODY TO COME TO THE RIGHT AND JUST SAY I GOT A GUY WHO'S BUYING A HOUSE AND HIS INCOME IS RIGHT THERE HE COULD ONLY AFFORD TO SPEND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE DOLLARS FOR HOME RESISTORS OTHERWISE HE CAN GET A HOUSE AND THEN I AND THEN I ALWAYS FEEL TERRIBLE BECAUSE I GOT TO SAY HEY YOU KNOW THE TO GET TO WHERE HE NEEDS TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE EIGHT HUNDRED BUCKS IF I START SHAVING AND TAKING OFF THINGS THAT BASICALLY NOW HE DOESN'T HAVE REPLACEMENT COST OF PERSONAL CONTENTS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT I HAVE TO TALK TO THESE GUYS TO SAY HEY YOU NEED TO SIGN SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU KNOW YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS RIGHT I MEAN SO IF PEOPLE ARE NOT WILLING TO BE COVERED PROPERLY THEN MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SIGNATURES SO THEY CAN COME BACK LATER OKAY YOU KNOW BECAUSE BERNIE A LOT OF PEOPLE DO IT FOR THAT REASON HOUSE YES MORE TESTIMONY TO HEAR SO ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SUM UP SECOND YEAH ANYTHING ELSE WE'VE MADE WONDERFUL SUGGESTIONS I THINK WE'VE TAKEN ALL DOWN OKAY NOT THINK THOSE WITH THE THINGS I WAS THANK YOU FOR COMING AND PARTICIPATING I THINK YOU'VE MADE SOME VERY GOOD SUGGESTIONS OF THAT YOU'RE WELCOME OKAY NECK NEXT WITH US HI MY NAME IS BOB LANES AND HOLDING BACK THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND NOW ON THE TIME OF THE FIRE WE DON'T ALLOW ANYBODY NOW WE ARE VERY UNDER INSURED -- NOW DAY WINE -- WE

TELL YOU THAT YES SIR MY NAME IS STORED FUNK I TO LIVE ON THAT LIST PEAK ROAD ARE USED TO HAVE A NEW JOB AND I'M THINKING ABOUT PRINTING BUSINESS CARDS FOR IT IT'S CALLED FIRE VICTIM -- I REITERATE AND SUPPORT THAT WHAT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE ME BY THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY ACCURATE OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES TRIPLE A REFUSE TO GIVE US MORE INSURANCE EVER RECORDS OF THE FACT THAT WE ATTEMPTED TO BUY INSURANCE KNOWING I'M I'VE BEEN IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS WE KNEW THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS HERE WERE FAR IN EXCESS OF WHAT TRIPLE A WAS ALLOWING SO WENT TO MY AGENT EVERY YEAR THEY SAID WHAT YOU HAVE AN EXTENDED POLICY OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT A SO THERE'S NOT GOING TO COVER IT I ARGUED ARGUED THEY SAY WE USE A NATIONAL SOME KIND OF AN AVERAGE THEY WOULD NEVER PROVIDE ME WITH THE FORMULA LONG STORY SHORT I WON'T BORE YOU WE WERE UNDER INSURED BECAUSE OF THAT FACTOR USA A WHO WE TRIED TO SWITCH INSURANCE COMPANIES RED LINES OUR AREA TRIPLE A USED TO REDLINE AND AS DID OTHER COMPANIES IN THE PAST AND I GUARANTEE YOU THIS IS A THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REVISIT IS -- COMPANIES REDLINING THESE AREAS OR MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE IF I GO TO REBUILD AND MY ASSURED THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO BUY AFFORDABLE INSURANCE IN THE FUTURE IF I A REBUILD AND THE AVERAGE AGE ON OUR MOUNTAIN WAS SEVENTY YEARS ALL AVERAGE MALE LIVES TO EIGHTY TWO AND A HALF AND I THINK I'VE AGE TEN SO I'VE GOT ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LEFT I GUESS THAT LET'S ASSUME I REBUILD AND AT SOME POINT I NEED TO SELL THIS PROPERTY I LIVE IN A RIDGE TOP AND -- THE NEW GUY CAN'T BUY INSURANCE NOW WHAT DO I DO I WANT TO SPEAK TO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BEAT THIS TO DEATH BUT -- ON THE LOSS OF USE -- I GOT CUT OFF BECAUSE THEY'VE DECIDED THEY'VE ALREADY PAID TOO MUCH THOUGH THERE'S ANOTHER COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND SITTING THERE THEY'RE NOW SAYING YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME YEAH HAVEN'T READ BILL YOU HAVEN'T SUBMITTED PLANS I HAVE MOVED SIX TIMES AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO MOVE A SEVEN TIME AND THERE'S NOTHING TO RANT THIS WILL GO OUT BY HOUSE THERE'S SOME COMING FROM THIRTY ACRES THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET AND A TRACK HOUSES A MILLION DOLLARS AND -- BY THE WAY THERE'S BIDDING WARS THIS IS NOT A GOOD MARKET FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE HIS HOUSE BURNT DOWN LET ALONE FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ANOTHER ISSUE AND I AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THIS IS THE -- REPLACEMENT VALUE -- INS I GET IT INSURANCE COMPANIES DON'T WANT FRAUD -- BUT HOW IT'S MISS REPRESENTED AN ANIMAL USE THAT TERM BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE IT IS THE REPLACEMENT COST IS IS BASED ON YOUR HONESTY AND UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY YOU'RE GONNA SAY I LOST SO MANY SOCKS I MEAN KAREN SOCKS FOR TEN MONTHS I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ELSE BUT MAKE LESS WE'VE GOT FIFTY PAGES OF SINGLE SPACED STAFF WHAT THEY DO WHEN YOU TURN IT IN IS THEY THEY DEPRECIATE I REPLACEMENT COST I GOT AS MUCH AS I GET BY BUT THEY LIMITED ME BASED ON A FORMULA BASED ON THE COST PER SQUARE FOOT SO I'M WAY UNDER INSURED THERE AFTER THE DEPRECIATED THEY HAND THERE ARE THE HAND YOU A CHECK FOR THE DEPRECIATED VALUE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE REPLACEMENT COST THE ONLY TIME THAT I CAN GET TRUE REPLACEMENT COST HAVE TO OUT BY EVERYTHING NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRTY ACRES OF STUFF IF I MOVE INTO TOWN WHERE MY GONNA PUT FIFTEEN CHORDS OF FIRE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THE BAND'S FIREPLACE WHERE AM I GOING TO PUT THE THINGS I INHERITED FROM TWO HOMES WHERE AM I GONNA AYE SOME OF THAT STUFF TO REPLACE IT WAS SOLD TO US AS A AS A POLICY THAT AND ALMOST EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO IT'S BASED ON A KITCHEN FIRE NOT A DISASTER AND YOU BASICALLY SEE PEOPLE GOING OUT AND BUYING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WITH THE STAFF TURN IN THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY GETTING FINALLY THAT REPLACEMENT COST AND TAKEN BACK TO THE STORE MY INSURANCE ADJUSTER THIS IS NUMBER FOUR SAID GOING CRAIGSLIST AND SELL EVERYTHING THAT YOU DON'T NEED AND YOU'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE MONEY LEFT OVER SO THAT WOULD BE YET AT A SECOND OR THIRD JOB OR WHATEVER IT IS I AM SO SOMETHING NEEDS TO

LIMIT THE LIMIT ON THE DWELLING MISSILE BE MY LAST COMMENT APPRECIATE THE TIME COVERAGE A WHERE ALL THE OTHER COVERAGES FLOW FROM THAT LIMIT IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGE OF COVERAGE A THAT SHOULD NOT BE A PLACE WHERE INSURERS ARE COMPETING FOR BUSINESS BY COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT AMOUNTS FOR REBUILDING WHICH SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MOST ACCURATE AVAILABLE INFORMATION TO GET THAT COVERAGE RIGHT AND WE
