BY THE PANDEMIC. EIGHT

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:38.791
EXPANSION OF CHILD CARE AND THE

CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND I

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:43.629
THINK ALL OF US HAVE BEEN

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:44.530
PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS

00:07:44.597 --> 00:07:48.434
PANDEMIC SAW SO MANY WOMEN.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.436
MANY MORE WOMEN THAN MEN LEAVE

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.105
THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:54.707
DURING THE PANDEMIC NO ONE TO

00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:56.209
CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.678
WHETHER IT WAS CHILDREN. OR

ELDERLY FOLKS OR DISABLED FOLKS

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.949
THAT WERE DEPENDENT ON THEM SO

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:07.186
WHEN THE SHUTDOWN OCCURRED AND

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:10.356
WE CAN'T BRING PEOPLE TO BE

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:11.490
CARED FOR HOW THEY OTHERWISE

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.426
WERE THEN WHAT HAPPENS

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:15.795
ATTENTION THIS SOCIETY TO FALL

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:16.829
THEN ON THE WOMAN IN THE

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.798
HOUSEHOLD AND SO WE SAW MANY

00:08:18.865 --> 00:08:21.767
MORE WOMEN LEAVE THEIR JOBS.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.270

OR SENIORS OR DISABLED FOLKS IN

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.546
WOMEN CANNOT GO BACK TO THE

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.648
WORKPLACE IN THE ESTIMATES OF

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:37.683
THE IMPACT OF THIS PANDEMIC ARE

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.818
BRINGING BACK WOMEN

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:39.752
ECONOMICALLY BACK TO THE

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:43.155
SEVENTIES AND FOR ONE I FOR ONE

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:45.524

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.560
SEVENTIES I DON'T RETURN TO

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:50.463
THAT ECONOMIC STATUS SO. THESE

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:53.199
ASPECTS OF THE PARTS OF OUR

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:56.736
BUDGET THAT CAN RESTORE FUNDING

T. K. ALL OF THOSE ARE

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:10.216
ESSENTIAL NOT ONLY JUST FOR THE

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.550
HEALTH OF THE ENTIRE ECONOMY IN

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:16.188
THE SOCIETY BUT CERTAINLY. FOR

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:16.689
THE HEALTH OF WOMEN AND

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:19.992
FAMILIES. ON THE OTHER- REALLY

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.528
GREAT NEWS ABOUT THIS BUDGET IS

00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.431
THAT WE WILL HAVE ACHIEVED PROP

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.132
NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THAT IS

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.767
FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:28.701
SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.404
AT NINETY SIX POINT ONE BILLION

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.773
DOLLARS. NINETY SIX POINT ONE

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.143
BILLION. WE ALSO HAVE AN

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:38.678
UNPRECEDENTED EXPANSION AND

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:40.613
FINANCIAL AID WHICH WE KNOW IS

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.316
ALSO SO NEEDED WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:46.052
THE LEVEL OF STUDENT DEBT. THAT

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:48.054
SO MANY PEOPLE ARE CARRYING. WE

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.455
WANT TO TRY TO AVOID THAT WE

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.990
WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.992

WITHOUT HAVING TO GO INTO

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:58.664
CRIPPLING DEBT. THE OTHER.

00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.533
THING WE ALL SHOULD BE VERY

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:01.968
PROUD ABOUT IN THIS BUDGET

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:04.870

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.572
DEAL WITH OUR UNSHELTERED

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.208
PEOPLE. THOSE WHO ARE LIVING IN

ENCAMPMENTS IN ALL OF OUR

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:14.146
COMMUNITIES THAT ALL OF US KNOW.

00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:16.282
NO REASON IN THE RICHEST STATE

00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:18.117
IN THE RICHEST ECONOMY OUR

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:19.885
NATION IN THE WORLD THAT WE

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.387
WOULD HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.289
LIVE ON OUR STREETS. AND SO WE

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:26.058
ARE GOING TO DO OUR BEST. TO A

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.927
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT EVEN

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:46.218
CHANGES BUT OVER MANY YEARS

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.289
GOVERNORS AND LEGISLATORS OF

00:14:50.356 --> 00:14:53.259
PUTTING MAJOR POLICY. THIS

00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:55.060
BUDGET CREATES A BUNCH OF NEW

00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:58.631
AGENCIES EVEN. AT NOW THOSE ARE

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:01.033

YEAH I SUPPOSE IT DOES BUT IT'S

00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.685
KIND OF A FRAUD ON THE PEOPLE

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.521
TO MAKE THEM THINK- LOOK AT ALL

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:23.088
THESE WONDERFUL THINGS WERE

00:15:23.155 --> 00:15:26.458

ACCRUED EXTRA REVENUES. THAT'S

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:34.033
WONDERFUL. AND AS WE DO THAT WE

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:35.668
SHOULD BE PRUDENT IN TERMS OF

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.903
WHAT WE SPEND THOSE ON. TO THE

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.705

MUCH A DEBT RETIREMENT HERE. IN

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:46.779
ONE PARTICULAR PART THAT I

00:15:46.845 --> 00:15:48.947
CONSIDER OFFENSIVE. EDT THE

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:53.419
MOST I AGREE JUST AGENCY ALMOST

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:55.821
IN HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. HOW

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.356
MANY OF OUR CITIZENS HAVE BEEN

00:15:57.423 --> 00:16:02.061
AGREED BY THAT AGENCY'S REMISS.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.495
IN INEFFICIENCY AND

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:08.467
INCOMPETENCE OVER YEARS. WHAT

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:09.101
WE'RE GONNA HELP THE BUSINESSES

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:12.971
OUT. A LITTLE BIT. BUT OVER A

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:17.876
DECADE GEE THAT'S REALLY GREAT.

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.678
THEY NEED HELP NOW WHY DO WE

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.480
HAVE TO DEFER THE IMPACT ON

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:23.349
THEM AND THE CITIZENS THAT WE

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:25.217
REPRESENT WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED

00:16:25.284 --> 00:16:27.886
BY THAT AGENCY. HOPEFULLY

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:29.388
BIPARTISAN WAY MEMBERS ARE

00:16:29.455 --> 00:16:31.657
WORKING TOGETHER. TO HAVE SOME

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:34.927
DRASTIC CHANGES. IN THE CONDUCT

00:16:34.993 --> 00:16:38.197
OF EDT. THIS LEGISLATURE DARE

00:16:38.263 --> 00:16:40.833
NOT ADJOURN WITHOUT DRASTICALLY

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:44.636
CHANGING STATUTORY. THE MISSION

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:47.673
AND CONDUCT OF THAT AGENCY.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.909
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT HERE. AND

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:51.543
I WOULD RATHER SEE THAT BE DONE

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.880
HERE. BUT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

00:16:54.947 --> 00:16:56.582
THE IMPLEMENTING SO CALLED

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:59.017
TRAILER BILLS. ARE GOING TO

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:00.719
HOLD FOR US WHENEVER WE GET

00:17:00.786 --> 00:17:02.721
AROUND TO DOING THAT. AND

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.356
REMEMBER WE COULD STILL BE

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:06.792
DOING TRAILER BILLS NEXT YEAR.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.927
IMPLEMENTING THE PROVISIONS OF

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.497
THIS BUDGET I WOULD ARGUE

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:13.832
MEMBERS TO. THOUGH THERE'S A

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:15.434
LOT OF REVENUE HERE THE STROLL

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:18.170
AROUND. A LOT OF THINGS THAT

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.339
COULD BE FUNDED. BUT SOME

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.975
THINGS ARE HUGE ONGOING

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:25.043
OBLIGATIONS AFFECTING FUTURE

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.479
BUDGETS. IMPACTING FUTURE

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:31.049
DEFICITS. DO NOT FORGET WHAT

00:17:31.116 --> 00:17:32.251
HAPPENED DURING THE DAVIS

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:35.387
ADMINISTRATION. THE DAVIS

00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:36.822
ADMINISTRATION CAME IN WITH A

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.758
BIG SURPLUS. AND BOY DID

00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:40.926
EVERYBODY SPEND EVEN

00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.461
REPUBLICANS GOT THEIR PIECE OF

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:45.731
THE ACTION. WITH SOME GIVE BACK

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.700
THE VOTERS. BUT WHAT THEN

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:52.571
HAPPENED. WE CONCRETIONS THE

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:56.175
BASE BUDGET. I BELIEVE WAS TWO

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.677
YEARS LATER WITH CROWD CROWDED

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.045
AWAY INTO TWENTY FOUR BILLION

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:02.114
DEFICIT AND THEN A FORTY FIVE

00:18:02.181 --> 00:18:04.016
BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. I

00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:06.652
PREDICT THAT THAT'S WHERE THIS

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:09.521
BUDGET IS HEADED. TWO TO FOUR

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.558
YEARS OUT HUGE DEFICITS BECAUSE

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.526
OF THE BUILT IN AUTOMATIC

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:16.228
OBLIGATIONS THAT WE'RE FINDING

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:21.233
HERE. AND WHAT ARE THE SHEET TO

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.802
THE MOTORING PUBLIC TO. WE HAD

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:24.937
TO RAISE THE GAS TAX WE HAD IN

00:18:25.003 --> 00:18:28.073
THE EXIT. THE NDP'S EVERYTHING

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.108
HAD TO BE. INCREASED AND

00:18:30.175 --> 00:18:34.847
INDEXED. WELL WHEN WE GET THE

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:36.648
TAXPAYERS A LITTLE BREAK THE

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:39.718
MOTORING PUBLIC A LITTLE BREAK

ABOUT THIS BUDGET AS A POSITIVE

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:12.751
BECAUSE I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS

00:19:12.818 --> 00:19:14.686
PROJECT. AND THIS IS NOT A

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.321
FIXED BUDGET WHILE THERE COULD

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.590
BE OBVIOUSLY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:19.691
WHETHER IT ADEQUATELY PAYS OFF

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:22.794
DEBTS. OR WHETHER IT CREATES-

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:27.199
FUTURE- COSTS THAT. MAY THEN

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:31.069
HAVE TO BE MODIFIED IF WE DO

FACING ECONOMIC CURRENT

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:35.107
DOWNTURN. WE WILL FACE THAT BUT

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.309
CERTAINLY IF WE TAKE FOR

00:19:37.376 --> 00:19:39.511
EXAMPLE INVESTMENTS IN CHILD

00:19:39.578 --> 00:19:42.548
CARE TO NOT INVEST NOW BECAUSE

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:45.384
WE FEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.720
SOME REDUCTION IN REVENUES IN

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:50.389
THREE TO FOUR YEARS WHAT IS THE

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.891
IMPACT ON THAT ZERO TO THREE

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:56.161
CHILD. THAT THEY DO NOT GET THE

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:58.363
QUALITY CARE AND EDUCATION THAT

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.499
WILL ALLOW THEM TO THRIVE AND

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:02.167
ALLOW OUR ECONOMY TO THRIVE

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:03.068
LATER BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:05.203
THRIVED. YOU CAN'T GET THAT

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.541
BACK SO I WOULD PREFER TO. DO

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.410
ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THOSE

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:16.248
BASIC NEEDS AND- AND IF WHEN WE

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:19.084
FACE SOME REVENUE DROPS WHICH

00:20:19.151 --> 00:20:20.852
ARE INEVITABLE WE KNOWS

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:23.055
ECONOMICS CYCLES WE HAVE

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.924

ABOUT THIS BUDGET THERE IS

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:30.195
QUESTION. AND IF. HORRENDOUSLY

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:31.630
WE FACE SOMETHING LIKE TWO

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:32.764
THOUSAND AND EIGHT IT DOESN'T

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.866
MATTER WHAT WE ADOPTED TODAY

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:38.236

THAT IS WHAT I FEEL THIS BUDGET

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:08.367
DOES AND IT IS PRUDENT. AND IT

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.669
IS NOT FAKE. AND WITH THAT WE

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:14.306

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:44.175
WHAT DIDN'T GET MENTIONED IS

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:45.644
THAT N. SEVENTY FIVE BILLION

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.579
DOLLARS OF EXTRA STATE MONEY WE

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:50.015
HAVE A TWENTY FIVE BILLION

00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:54.152
DOLLAR ROUTE IN TOTAL RESERVES

00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.120
TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:57.088
THAT DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE AND

00:25:57.155 --> 00:25:58.924
THAT REALLY IS DESIGNED TO EVEN

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.326
OUT THE BOOM AND BUST OF THE

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:03.395
BUDGETS WE HAVE A I THINK THE

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:05.363
NUMBERS ELEVEN BILLION IS IN

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.799
STIMULUS IT'S A ONE TIME AND IT

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:08.900
GOES TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:10.635
BEEN STRUGGLING THE MOST IN

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:12.570
THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AND SO

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:15.473
THAT REALLY ARE TRIES TO EVEN

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.308
OUT TO WHERE WE ARE IN THE

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:18.643
ECONOMY THIS BUDGET DOES PAY

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.879
OFF DEBTS YEAH THE DEFERRALS

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:23.748
THAT EXISTED WERE FOR EDUCATION

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:24.549
WE'RE NOT EVEN PROPOSED TO BE

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:26.651
COMPLETELY PAID OFF IN THE

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:28.787
PROPOSED BUDGET THIS BUDGET

00:26:28.853 --> 00:26:32.490
DOES IT SO THAT THE- INTERESTED

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:33.892
TWO CREWED BY LOCAL SCHOOL

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:35.760
DISTRICTS WILL NOT BE APPROVED

00:26:35.827 --> 00:26:38.396
THE DEFERRAL WAS PAID OFF AND

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:39.064
THEN THERE ARE DISH NO ONE TIME

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.132
EXPENDITURES ONE FOUR BILLION

00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:43.535
DOLLARS FOR. HIGHER EDUCATION

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:45.737
BUILDING CONSTRUCTION OTHERWISE

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.672
WE WOULD BE ASKED TO DO A BOND

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:49.574
WE WOULD BE ASKED TO PAY MAYBE

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:52.143
A DOLLAR EIGHTY CENTS FOR EVERY

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.511
DOLLAR THAT WENT TO BUILDING

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:55.413
CONSTRUCTION INSTEAD OF PUTTING

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.349
AN END TO A BOND AND INCURRING

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:59.384
THAT DEBT WE'RE DOING A ONE

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:00.785
TIME EXPENDITURE FOR THE FOUR

00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:01.786
BILLION DOLLARS WE'RE

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:04.022
RECOMMENDING IN THIS BUDGET. SO

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.590
AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:27:05.657 --> 00:27:10.128
FACT THAT THERE ARE INCREASED.

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:11.329
ON GROWING REVENUES WE IN DRESS

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.964
IMPACT THOSE ISSUES THAT WERE

00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:14.566
MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR. WHETHER

00:27:14.632 --> 00:27:16.534
IT'S HOMELESSNESS CHILD CARE

00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:20.939
SLOTS HEALTH CARE- A DEBT FREE

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:24.342
COLLEGE PRESCHOOL AND SO THIS

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.144
IS A VERY SOUND BUDGET THAT.

00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:28.513
WITH ONGOING REVENUES ADDRESSES

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.582
WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR IMPACT

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:32.183
AND IS REALLY SOUND WITH A

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.718
LARGE AMOUNT OF RESERVES A

00:27:33.785 --> 00:27:35.086
LARGE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY

00:27:35.153 --> 00:27:36.087
GOING TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.956
IT. A LARGE AMOUNT ONE TIME

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.724
MONEY AVERTING THE NEED FOR

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:41.493
BONDS A LARGE AMOUNT OF ONE

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:43.261
TIME MONEY PAYING OFF DEBT.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:45.530
THIS IS SOUND FISCAL WAY AND I

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:46.931
JUST THOUGHT IT WAS VERY

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:47.899
IMPORTANT TO MAKE THOSE POINTS

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:49.701
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:51.703
LAYER DOES WERE VERY IMPORTANT

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:55.240
POINTS IN YOUR- I'M SURE YOU.

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.441
COULD HAVE ALSO INCLUDED THE

00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.310
FACT THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE NOT

00:27:59.377 --> 00:28:01.179
DOING A BLIND FOR THAT

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:03.848
NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE AT OUR

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:04.883
HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH OF

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:07.552
COURSE. CREATES DEBT WE ARE

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:08.920
INVESTING IN IT DIRECTLY WE'RE

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.321
ALSO DOING SIMILARLY FOR

00:28:10.388 --> 00:28:12.490
CLIMATE RESILIENCY. AND SO WE

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.692
ARE ADDRESSING WITH THE

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:16.494
REVENUES WE HAVE NOW. THOUGH

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.396
CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND IN THE

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:20.465
FUTURE YES WE MAY HAVE TO SOME

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:21.900
POINT WELL WELL INTO THE FUTURE

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:23.535
CONSIDER A BOND BUT AT THIS

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:24.903
POINT WE'RE NOT HAVING TO DO

00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:27.305
THAT AND BY NOT DOING IT WE ARE

00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:28.606
NOT CREATING DEBT AS YOU

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.375
POINTED OUT. AND I'M SURE WHEN

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:32.644
THE LA- PRESENTS. THEY WILL

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.048
POINT OUT. THAT THIS BUDGET. IS

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:39.484
STRUCK. DOWN THROUGH THE NEXT

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.953
FOUR FISCAL YEARS SO WHEN I

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.591
REFERRED. THAT OCCURS WE KNOW

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:49.561
THE ECONOMY IS IT HAPPENS. FOR

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:52.297
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS THERE IS NO

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:55.600
PROJECTED OUT YEAR DEFICITS. SO

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.702
IN THAT RESPECT I WAS VERY

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.204
ACCURATE IN THIS NOT BEING A

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.006
FAKE BY CHECK. AND LET ME CALL

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:04.476
ON SENATOR EKMAN. ALL RIGHT ANY

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:10.849
OTHER YES SENATOR DOLLY. THANK

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:13.151
YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST LIKE TO

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:16.054
MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS ON.

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:16.621
WE'RE DEBATING OVER A BUDGET

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:19.991
THAT HAS. A LOT OF MONEY IN IT

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:21.626
AND I THINK IT'S- THERE ARE

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:23.261
SOME PRUDENT THINGS IN HERE

00:29:23.328 --> 00:29:26.331
ABOUT PAYING ONE TIME DEBTS.

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:26.931
BUT WHAT I WANT TO COMMENT ON

00:29:26.998 --> 00:29:29.801
IS WHAT ARE THE DELIVERABLES TO

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.836
ME IT'S NOT. SO MUCH ABOUT THE

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.872
MONEY IT'S ABOUT THE POLICY OF

00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:36.107
HOW WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT. WHAT

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:38.676
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. A

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:40.945
FEW YEARS BACK WE WORKED ON.

00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:42.280
THE WATER BORNE INTO MANY

00:29:42.347 --> 00:29:43.148
MEMBERS IN HERE WE WORKED

00:29:43.214 --> 00:29:45.917
REALLY HARD TO PASS A BOND.

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:49.287
THAT WOULD. CREATE MORE WATER.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:51.089
IT WAS A DIFFICULT BATTLE WE

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.590
WENT BACK AND FORTH WE TALKED

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:56.327
ABOUT STORAGE. AND HERE WE ARE.

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:58.596
SIX YEARS LATER AND WE HAVEN'T.

00:29:58.663 --> 00:30:01.065
CREATED ONE GALLON OF WATER

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:02.467
STORAGE AND WE'RE IN A DROUGHT.

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:06.704
SO WE HAVE BROADBAND SEVEN

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:08.706
BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET.

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:11.075
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:12.644
COUNTLESS BILLS MOVING THROUGH

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:14.779
THE LEGISLATURE. BUT WE REALLY

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.414
DON'T HAVE A PLAN ON EXACTLY

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.917
HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK. AND

00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:23.555
SO I PROPOSE THAT. ON THE- THE

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:26.291
WATER THE MONEY GOING FOR. YOU

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.659
COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICTS AND

00:30:27.725 --> 00:30:29.694
HOW WE NEED DETAILS WE NEED

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:31.596
DETAIL OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO.

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.298
PLAY OUT AND HOW IT'S ACTUALLY

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:34.966
GOING TO BE THE DELIVERABLES ON

00:30:35.033 --> 00:30:37.202
THE GROUND WITH THE SAME THING

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:39.737
WITH BROADBAND. LOOK WE HAVE

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:41.472
ALL THESE BILLS WE NEED. A

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:43.208
COMMITTEE TO SIT DOWN WITH ALL

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:44.275
THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:45.643
TRYING TO GET SOMEWHERE AND

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.879
ACTUALLY PUT A POLICY IN PLACE

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:49.681
THAT DELIVERS WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:50.915
TO ACCOMPLISH I THINK. THE

00:30:50.982 --> 00:30:53.117
PERSPIRATION FOR ME MORE THAN

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.186
ANYTHING IS THAT IT'S NOT A

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:57.155
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.823
GOVERNMENT ALWAYS THROWS MORE

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.492
MONEY AT IT BUT THE POLICY. IS

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.027
THE PROBLEM. SO I WOULD

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:05.230
ENCOURAGE THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:31:05.296 --> 00:31:06.531
TO REALLY LOOK AT THE POLICY

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:08.700
AND WHAT IS THE DELIVERABLE AT

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:10.702
THE END OF ALL THIS. HUGE

00:31:10.768 --> 00:31:13.271
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE GONNA BE

00:31:13.338 --> 00:31:15.206
PUSHING OUT MORE MONEY THAN

00:31:15.273 --> 00:31:16.140
WE'VE EVER PUSHED OUT INTO A

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.942
BUDGET BUT HOW IS IT REALLY

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:19.711
GOING TO AFFECT THE PERSON

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:21.813
THAT'S IN THE INNER CITY THAT'S

00:31:21.879 --> 00:31:23.081
IN A HOUSING PROJECT FOR THE

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:26.217
BROADBAND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:26.784
KNOW. I WANT TO KNOW ARE WE

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:27.885
REALLY GONNA DELIVER. ARE WE

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:31.356
GONNA DELIVER WATER BUT WE GET

00:31:31.422 --> 00:31:31.923
IT WE DID SOME EARLY ACTION

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.059
ITEMS FOR THE FIRE WE KNOW

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:37.128
WE'RE GOING TO IT'S AS THIS IS

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:39.430
THE CHAIRMAN STATED. IT'S GONNA

00:31:39.497 --> 00:31:42.400
BURN IT'S THE MOISTURE IS BEING

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:43.735
SUCKED OUT EVERY DAY I HAVE

THIS EARLY IN THE YEAR- ON OUR

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:49.674
FARM AND SO THAT'S TAKING

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:51.476
MOISTURE OUT OF OUR PLANTS. SO

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:52.610
WE DID SOME EARLY ACTION IS BUT

00:31:52.677 --> 00:31:54.379
FOR ME VENTURE MEMBERS I WOULD

COMMIT THE STATE TO- LONG TERM

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.355
SPENDING THAT IT CANNOT AFFORD

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.757
IT WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:01.125
TO CUTS IN THE FUTURE TO CORE

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.993
PROGRAMS- BUT IMPORTANTLY WE

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:03.794
LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING A

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.796
BUDGET THAT. INVESTS IN AND

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.832
KEEPS ALL CALIFORNIANS ON A

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:09.700

REVENUE ESTIMATES R. EIGHT

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:34.558
BILLION HIRED IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.160
OF FINANCES THAT WERE CONTAINED

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:37.394
IN THE MAY REVISE AND THAT'S

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:39.163
PARTIALLY DUE TO THE FACT OF

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.965
SOME REVENUES THAT CAME IN

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:44.535
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. I MEAN AND-

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:48.239
SO I- OUT WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:52.309
ELABORATE ON IS- DID JUST MOVE

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:54.278
THOSE REVENUES THAT CAME IN BUT

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:58.015
ALSO. YOU THIS IS ALWAYS A BIG

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:59.149
DEPARTMENT FINANCE OF COURSE

00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:00.784
DOES FOR CASTELLI- DOES

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:03.520
FORECAST BUT THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:07.191
HAS. RELIED ON THE LA- FOR THIS

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:09.393
FORECAST BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.730
EXPERIENCED THAT YOUR FORECASTS

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.832
FORECASTS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:17.568
MORE ACCURATE THEN IN THE LAST

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:20.170
COUPLE OF YEARS AND SO IF YOU-

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:22.640
WOULDN'T MIND COMING IN ON THAT

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:27.244
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- WE- IS THAT

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.647
PORTION OF THE ARCHITECTURE IS

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:32.516
VERY IMPORTANT SO THAT. WE KNOW

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.485
THAT WE ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:37.388
AS WE HAVE. DESCRIBED AND WE

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:40.124
INTEND TO BE SIR GO AHEAD. YES

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.960
OKAY THAT'S- AND IMPORTING

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:45.362
QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- AND I

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:47.631
WILL SAY THAT WE DID DO OUR YOU

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.000
KNOW OUR LEVEL BEST TO MAKE OUR

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:52.269
BEST GUESS ESTIMATE ON THE

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:53.871
REVENUE THEN OF COURSE OUR

00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:55.439
REVENUES COULD JUST BECAUSE

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:59.109
THEY'VE BEEN- YOU KNOW- CLOSER

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.778
TO THE ACTUAL THAN SOME RECENT

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.846
YEARS THAT DOESN'T MEAN- THEY

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:05.382
ALWAYS WILL BE BUT ACCORDING TO

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:09.019
OUR- SCENARIO ANALYSIS. WE

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.120
THINK WE'RE AT ABOUT THE

00:43:10.187 --> 00:43:12.323
FIFTIETH PERCENTILE POTENTIAL

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.425
OUTCOME WHICH MEANS ALTHOUGH

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.593
OUR REVENUES COULD ESTIMATE

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.695
COULD PROVE TO BE TOO HIGH THEY

00:43:17.761 --> 00:43:19.830
COULD ALSO PROVE TO BE TOO LOW

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:24.902
RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL RESULTS-

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:27.338
ONE REASON- SEVERAL REASONS

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:29.974
THAT WE FEEL LIKE. CONTINUATION

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.409
OF RELATIVELY STRONG REVENUE

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:35.913
GROWTH IS LIKELY REFLECTS- THAT

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.548
THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THE

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:40.451
FIRST IS THAT- THE CONSENSUS OF

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:42.319
ECONOISTS AT THIS TIME IS THAT

00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:45.522
THE- ECONOMY IS POISED TO GROW

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:48.025
AT ITS FASTEST CLIP IN THE PAST

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:51.962
FORTY YEARS- IN ADDITION NOW

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.364
THE ECONOMY IS STILL

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.132
EXPERIENCING CONSIDERABLE

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:58.602
ASSISTANCE FROM- FEDERAL FISCAL

00:43:58.669 --> 00:43:59.970
IMPORTS COMING THROUGH OUR

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:03.140
SYSTEM SO THAT'S GONNA- ADDED

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:05.509
BOOST TO GDP GROWTH- FEDERAL

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.077
RESERVE OFFICIALS HAVE

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.812
EXPRESSED COMMITMENT TO AN

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:10.614
ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY POLICY

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:11.682
WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE LOW

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.117
INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WHICH

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.752
IS USUALLY CONDUCIVE TO

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:15.586
ECONOMIC GROWTH. BROADLY

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:18.288
SPEAKING. AND THEN YOU KNOW

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:20.090
RELATED TO THAT THE FINAL POINT

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.326
IS THAT AT THEIR PRICES REMAIN

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:25.662
HIGH AND- WITH HIGH STOCK

00:44:25.729 --> 00:44:27.698
PRICES AND HOME VALUES YOU KNOW

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:30.467
DOES GENERATE. CONSIDERABLE

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:33.303
PERSONAL INCOME TAX REVENUES IN

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.339
PARTICULAR FOR THE STATE AND SO.

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.675
WELL THAT PARTICULAR ELEMENT IS

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:40.811
PUT IS SUBJECT TO A LOT OF

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:42.980
UNCERTAINTY AT LEAST FOR THE

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:46.016
UPCOMING BUDGET YEAR WE THINK

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.318
THAT THE BEST. YES IN OUR IN

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:50.854
OUR- WORLD VIEW IS THAT THE

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:53.257
CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH OF

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:53.824
REVENUES IS MORE LIKELY THAN

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:58.829
NOT- AND SO- YOU KNOW THAT THAT

00:44:58.896 --> 00:45:01.065
SPEAKS TO WHY OUR REVENUES WERE

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.733
PROBABLY YOU KNOW IN THE RANGE

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:03.567
OF FOUR BILLION HIGHER THAN

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.302
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AROUND

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:06.503
THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISION

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.840
AND THEN. AS YOU MENTIONED- IN

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:11.408
APRIL AND MAY TAX COLLECTIONS

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:13.544
CONTINUE TO SURPASS THE EARLIER

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.112
ESTIMATE AND WE'RE NOT

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:19.983
REFLECTED IN OUR- FORECAST AND-

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.685
THEREFORE YOU COULD ADD THOSE

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.720
TO THE TO THE MIX IN THAT LIST

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:25.055
THE REVENUE ESTIMATES BEST

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:27.724
IMAGE BY. ANOTHER THREE POINT

00:45:27.791 --> 00:45:28.959
NINE BILLION SO WHEN YOU ADD

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.094
THE FOUR BILLION IN THE THREE

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.095
POINT NINE THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:33.630
GETTING TO THE EIGHT BILLION

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:36.033
HIGHER REVENUES. I APPRECIATE

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.336
THAT EXPLANATION- ME SEE IF I

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.939
HAD ANOTHER QUESTION HI YOU

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:46.110
ALSO MENTIONED- BE A CHRISTIAN

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:48.479
THAT WAS BUILT IN FOR OUR

00:45:48.545 --> 00:45:51.181
SCHOOLS IN RELATIONSHIP TO PROP

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.483
NINETY EIGHT COULD YOU JUST

00:45:52.549 --> 00:45:54.952
ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE MORE.

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:57.287
SURE YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK-

00:45:57.354 --> 00:46:00.224
THE BUDGET IN AND KIND OF TWO

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:01.725
SIDES OF THE HOUSE WANTED THE

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.460
NON NINETY EIGHT SIDE AND THEN

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:04.828
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:07.231
SIDE. AND SO AS A BUDGET WITHIN

00:46:07.297 --> 00:46:08.432
THE BUDGET THE PROPOSITION

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:10.834
NINETY EIGHT- OVERALL FUNDING

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:13.971
LEVEL- INCLUDE THIS YEAR A

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:17.307
SIGNIFICANT- ALLOCATION TO ONE

00:46:17.374 --> 00:46:20.144
TIME SPENDING. AND SO WITH THAT

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:23.013
ONE TIME SPENDING- I'M SORRY IF

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.615
THE IF THE GUARANTEE WERE TO GO

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:26.216
DOWN IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR THAT

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:28.385
ONE TIME SPENDING WOULD NOT BE

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.921
BAKED INTO THE- SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:33.690
BUDGETS AND WOULD RESULT AND-

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:36.093
YOU KNOW LESS- FISCAL PRESSURE

ALLOCATION TO ONE TIME- I DON'T

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:47.137
KNOW PERHAPS MY COLLEAGUE EDGAR

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.506

ROSLYN'S GLOWING FROM WITHIN I

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.618
THINK I WAS JUST NOT A GOOD DAY

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:06.190
THE PROPOSITION NINETY RESERVE-

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:07.491

THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE IN

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:10.761
THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT'S

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:12.629
A REFLECTION OF THE ADDITIONAL-

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:13.931
ROMANISM HIGHER MINIMUM

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:16.400

UNDER UNDER THE- CONSTITUTION

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.537
REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESEARCH.

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:23.140
ARM IN ADDITION BECAUSE THE

00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:24.641
LEGISLATURE IS MAKING A LARGE

00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:26.176
DEPOSIT IN THIS BUDGET IT WOULD

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:26.743
BE A THREE POINT ONE BILLION

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.012
DOLLAR DEPOSIT. IN THE BUDGET

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.714
YEAR IN ADDITION THERE IS A

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:32.449
VARIETY OF ONE TIME I'M

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:34.284
SPENDING THERE IS A VERY HARD

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:36.253
QUESTION IN THIS. IN THIS

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.355
BUDGET- WHICH MEANS THAT WE'RE

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:41.124
REVENUES TO DECLINE NEXT YEAR-

00:47:41.191 --> 00:47:43.360
THE NEED FOR REDUCTIONS OF ARMS

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.064
EXCUSE PROGRAMS WHICH WOULD BE

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.265
UNLIKELY UNLESS IT WAS A VERY

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:54.037

PROVIDING US. THAT THE

00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:12.589
LEGISLATURE BOTH HOUSES HAVE.

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:13.857
RELIED ON A GREAT DEAL THIS

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.459
YEAR IN TERMS OF STRUCTURING

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:16.360
THIS AND WE REALLY DO

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:20.097
APPRECIATE. THAT DOES THAT

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:25.202
REVIEW AND ANALYSIS. SO SENATOR

I THINK I SAW ANOTHER HAND UP

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.107
BUT OFTEN SECOND GO AHEAD

FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OF THE

00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.987
ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN FAR MORE

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:47.190
CLOSE TO THE POINT THEN

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.992
GOVERNORS. I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.460
AND THAT IS REALLY NOT THE

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:51.895
POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO DO

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:53.263
WELL ON OTHER THAN THE FACT

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:53.964
THAT WE PUT A LOT OF

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.632
CREDIBILITY IN THE LEGISLATIVE

00:48:55.699 --> 00:49:00.937
ANALYST. IT APPEARS TO ME. THAT

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:03.640
WE'RE CONTINUING. FROM TWELVE

00:49:03.707 --> 00:49:05.742
BILLION AND SOLUTIONS FROM LAST

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:11.448
YEAR. AND WE'VE DONE THAT. OUR

00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:14.484
CONTINUED TO BORROW. SOME THREE

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:16.987
BILLION DOES THAT MAKE A LOT OF

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:20.123
SENSE TO BE CONTINUING THAT AND

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.224
AS WELL THE GOVERNOR'S

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.593
EMERGENCY AUTHORITY I LIKE TO

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:24.661
GET INTO THAT IN GREATER DEPTH

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:27.364
TWO. BUT I PARTICULARLY THAT

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.666
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THAT

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:30.133
BORROWING WHILE WE'RE

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.270
INCREASING SPENDING VERY

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:36.373
SUBSTANTIALLY. IN THE BUDGET DO

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.574
YOU VIEW THAT AS THE MOST

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:39.242
PRUDENT APPROACH FOR THE

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:45.782
LEGISLATURE. WELL SENATOR NEIL

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:48.952
FINN- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:52.356
YOU'RE- SPEAKING TO IS REALLY.

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:54.891
A AN IMPORTANT QUESTION OF

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:57.227
TRADEOFFS AND RISK TOLERANCE AT

00:49:57.294 --> 00:50:03.100
THE END OF THE DAY AND- WHILE

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.736
WE DID- MENTIONED THE

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:08.205
CONTINUATION OF. THE USES OF

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.107
THOSE RESOURCES IN THE CURRENT

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:13.777
BUDGET I WOULD- YOU KNOW I

00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:16.747
WOULD NOTE THAT THE- YOU KNOW

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.949
THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES IS

00:50:19.015 --> 00:50:21.585
COMPLYING WITH THE PROPOSITION

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:22.352
TWO REQUIREMENTS AND

00:50:22.419 --> 00:50:25.722
INCREASING- THE RAINY DAY FUND

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:28.058
DEPOSIT. AND IT DOES DO SOME

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:29.526
OTHER THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.261
MENTIONS THAT THE PREVIOUSLY

00:50:31.328 --> 00:50:34.831
SUCH AS THE- FUNDING INTO THE

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:37.000
SAFETY NET RESERVE- THE

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:40.670
PREPAYMENT OF. OF BONDED DEBT

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:43.340
SERVICE AND THEN- ALSO THE PAY

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:46.510
DOWN THE FULL PAY DOWN OF THOSE

00:50:46.576 --> 00:50:48.378
SCHOOL DEFERRAL. AND SO I THINK

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:51.948
WHAT WHERE THAT LEAVES US IS

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.850
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD YOU

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:56.119
KNOW AT THIS POINT THE WRITTEN

00:50:56.186 --> 00:50:57.554
THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.856
COMPARED TO- TWENTY YEARS AGO

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:02.125
OR BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:04.628
AND SO THAT'S ONE IMPORTANT-

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:07.297
CREDITS TO START WITH BUT THEN

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:12.068
I GUESS YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY. IT

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:12.669
WILL BE UP FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:15.672
TO. BALANCE THE TRADEOFFS AND

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:18.875
ASSESS ITS RISK TOLERANCE FOR-

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.944
TO KIND OF OPPOSING TENSIONS

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.946
WANTED TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.381
DOWNTURN BY YOU KNOW

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:26.049
REPLENISHING EVEN MORE RESERVES

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:27.083
ARE USING A LOT OF

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.619
DISCRETIONARY RESERVES FOR-

00:51:29.686 --> 00:51:30.687
REPLENISH THEIR BUILDING

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:33.657
RESERVES PURSES- USING THE

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.392
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.993
THAT HAD THAT HAND TO ADDRESS

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.595
SOME OF ITS PRIORITIES AT THIS

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:40.931
TIME THEN YOU COULD. MAKE A

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:42.032
CASE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:45.735
BUT- YOU KNOW IF IT TURNS OUT

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:46.837
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A DOWNTURN

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:49.005
IN THE YOU KNOW NEXT FEW YEARS

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:51.208
THAT COULD- PROVED TO BE

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:51.975
SOMEWHAT OF A MISSED

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:53.243
OPPORTUNITY IF THERE ARE

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.545
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THAT.

00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:57.681
WARRANTS ATTENTION AT THIS TIME

00:51:57.747 --> 00:52:00.016
AND SO I THINK THE DISCUSSION

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.485
YOU'RE HAVING TODAY IS REALLY

00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:04.788
ABOUT THOSE COMPETING ARE

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:07.224
PRIORITIES AND WHERE ARE YOU-

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.226

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:11.361
HOW ARE YOU- AND INCORPORATE

00:52:11.428 --> 00:52:15.966
THAT INTO. YOUR OVERALL RISK

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:17.100
TOLERANCE. WELL THE CONCERN I

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:19.903
HAVE IS ALWAYS BETTER BUILDING-

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.705
THAT WE DO THINGS THAT BUILD

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:23.306
THE BASE AND WE'RE CONTINUING

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:25.075
TO BORROW AND IN ADDITION HERE

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.577
WE ARE CONTINUING TO PROCEED TO

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.545
THE GOVERNOR THESE ARE

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:31.114

SEEMS TO GUARD THOSE. YEAH THAT

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:34.384

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.286
AGO TO ME GIVING THE GOVERNOR

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:38.121
THOSE EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES.

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.923
BUT GOVERNORS PLURAL HAVE BEEN

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:42.526
VERY JEALOUSLY PROTECTING THAT

GOVERNOR THE AUTHORITY THAT I

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.200
DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:51.868
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE GOVERNORS

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:53.203
HAVE BEEN ABUSING. THAT

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:56.106
EMERGENCY AUTHORITY TO EXERCISE

00:52:56.172 --> 00:52:58.008

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:09.057
SENATOR DOLLINGER QUESTION AND

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:11.626
I'LL WOULD JUST EITERATE THAT-

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:13.027
OUR BUDGET INCLUDES LOWER

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:15.530
REVENUES- IN THE CURRENT IN THE

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:16.831
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.199
OUT YEARS THEN COMPARED TO THE

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:20.969
L. A. O. THE LA- REVENUES- DO

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:22.837
GROW. AT ABOUT AT LEAST FOUR

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.673
PERCENT- IN THE OUT YEARS AND

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:26.708
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAY

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:30.545
REVISION. AND THE- BUDGET

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:31.846

TWENTY BILLION IN IN IN A

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:38.152
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE GAP.

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:39.387
AND SO- I THINK EITHER

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:41.656
QUESTION- IS MORE IN LINE WITH

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.291
THE ALLEY ON REVENUE SO I'LL

01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:49.330

WILL JUST KNOW- SENATOR DOLLY

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.673
PARTON. MY COMMENTS ON OUR

01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.540
REVENUE OUTLOOK WE'RE

01:27:59.607 --> 01:28:01.909
PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON KIND OF

01:28:01.976 --> 01:28:05.146
THE BUDGET YEAR PERIOD. AND YOU

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:09.584
pPARTICULAR. WE THINK IT. YOU

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:10.685
KNOW WE HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.186
OUR IN OUR FORECAST OF COURSE

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:14.989
OVER THE NEXT. TWELVE TO

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:16.858
EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THEN MAYBE YOU

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:17.825
KNOW THERE IS GREATER

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:19.594
UNCERTAINTY THE FURTHER YOU GO

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:24.866
OUT. INTO THE FUTURE. AND SO.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.234
THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST POINT

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.302
THE OTHER POINT I MEAN I THINK

01:28:28.369 --> 01:28:29.737
YOU'RE- COMMENTS ABOUT

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.840
INFLATION OR OR WILL TAKE AND-

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.442
YOU KNOW LIKE IN MY MIND ONE OF

01:28:34.509 --> 01:28:35.743
THE BIGGER RISKS RELATED TO

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:37.879
INFLATION WOULD JUST BE. BETTER

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:40.248
IF THEY DID THE- BECOME HIGHER

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:42.850
THAN EXPECTED OR IF THE

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.986
CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS AN

01:28:45.053 --> 01:28:48.222
EMPLOYER EXPECTATIONS BECAME

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:50.024
WHAT THEY CALL UNANCHORED- YOU

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:51.125
KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.627
POTENTIAL THAT THE FED WOULD

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:54.395
HAVE TO ACT SOONER THAN THEY'RE

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:56.731
CURRENTLY SIGNALING TO THE TO

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:58.700
THE MARKET. AND IN THAT

01:28:58.766 --> 01:29:00.301
SCENARIO THERE IS SOME

01:29:00.368 --> 01:29:02.737
POTENTIAL THAT- FED TIGHTENING

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:05.473
COULD CAUSE THE ECONOMY TO SLOW

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.542
AND IN THAT SCENARIO WE WOULD

01:29:07.608 --> 01:29:10.111
EXPECT- REVENUE GROWTH TO SLOW

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.513
AS WELL SO I MEAN I DON'T THINK

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.282
THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:17.452
POSSIBILITY AT ALL BUT- BUT AT

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:20.788
THE SAME TIME I MEAN THERE. ARE

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.824
A LOT OF INDICATIONS THAT A LOT

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.425
OF THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:25.693
THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW

01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.496
I'LL HAVE TO DO WITH KIND.

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:31.699
BASED EFFECTIVE COMPARING-

01:29:31.766 --> 01:29:33.868
CURRENT PRICE LEVELS TO WHERE

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:35.369
THEY YOU KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON

01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:37.105
ONE YEAR AGO WHEN THE ECONOMY

01:29:37.171 --> 01:29:39.040
WAS IN A FREE FALL. AND SO

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.975
WE'RE KIND OF COMPARING THAT-

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:43.344
CURRENT PRICE CHANGES AGAINST-

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:46.581
ABNORMAL- BASE FROM LAST YEAR

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:47.949
AND SO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.350
CHANGES TO THAT WERE SEEN OUT

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:52.854
OF A SUPPLY CHAIN- DISRUPTIONS

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.789
DUE TO THAT IS TO THE PANDEMIC

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.624
IN TRYING TO TURN THE ECONOMY.

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:58.659
YOU KNOW BACK ON IF YOU WILL

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:02.063
AND YOU KNOW SO THERE IS A GOOD

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:03.431
POSSIBILITY THAT A LOT OF THE

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:04.565
INFLATION THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:05.767
RIGHT NOW COULD PROVE TO BE

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:08.836
RELATIVELY TRANSITORY AND- NOT

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:11.305
WITH THAT- GOING FORWARD BUT IT

01:30:11.372 --> 01:30:13.207
I MEAN I DON'T. I DON'T WANT

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:16.077
TO- YOU KNOW BE TOO SANGUINE

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:17.912
ABOUT THAT I THINK YOUR YOUR-

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:20.381
YOUR CONCERN ABOUT IT IS-

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:27.488
FOUNDED ON SOME REASONABLE-

01:30:27.555 --> 01:30:29.724
BASIS SO. THANK YOU RON

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:32.226
CHURCHES. YEAH GO AHEAD JUST A-

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:33.094
SO JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT THE

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:33.694
THAT WE NEED TO BE TALKING OF

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:36.330
THE FACT THAT. HE WILL WORSEN

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:38.266
PLACE. AND WE EVEN FEW. NOT CAL.

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:41.102
BUT IT FEDERAL. I MEAN. SIX

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:42.470
TRILLION DOLLARS INTO THE

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:45.506
ECONOMY- AND THAT'S IN IT WITH

01:30:45.573 --> 01:30:46.541
AND WE HAVE SEEN AND WE'VE

01:30:46.607 --> 01:30:47.642
HEARD THAT WE'RE GONNA SEE

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:49.610
INTEREST RATES STAY FLAT-

01:30:49.677 --> 01:30:50.978
THEY'RE EDGING UP A LITTLE BIT

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:52.113
BUT NOT AT THE RATE OF

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.849
INFLATION SO JUST A JUST A

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:56.150
COMMON IF IT. IF IT COST YOU.

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.485
BUT YOU KNOW TWICE AS MUCH TO

01:30:57.552 --> 01:30:58.419
GET DONE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.488
DO BECAUSE INFLATION AND THEY

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:01.522
KNOW IT REALLY IS GOING TO

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:02.924
IMPACT OUTCOMES OF OUR BUDGET

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.525
AND SO I JUST WANTED TO. SEE

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.561
WHAT THEY TOOK THAT INTO

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:07.161
CONSIDERATION I APPRECIATE THE

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:09.964
OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. I'M

EVERYONE ALL OF OUR OUR TEAMS-

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.781
I BELIEVE THAT- PUTTING MONEY

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.549
IN THE POCKETS OF WORKING

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:30.084
PEOPLE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IS

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:32.353
WHAT LEADS TO A STRONG AND

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.589
RELIABLE ECONOMY AND I THINK SO

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:36.290
MUCH OF THAT HAS STARTED TO

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:39.093
HAPPEN ALREADY- YOU KNOW

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.261
THERE'S FEDERAL AND STATE

01:31:40.328 --> 01:31:42.296
DOLLARS FOR BUSINESSES TO OPEN

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:44.999
AND- GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:46.534
CONTINUE TO HELP THE

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:49.503
UNEMPLOYED- BUT MANY WERE LEFT

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.505
OUT AND THAT'S WHERE

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:53.908
GOVERNMENT- HAS TO STEP IN. TO

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:56.244
MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:59.647
WORK. TO MAKE A GOOD LIVING-

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:02.116
THEY SPEND THAT MONEY. YOU KNOW

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:03.751
THE WEALTHIER YOU ARE THE LESS

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:06.053
MONEY YOU SPEND- AND I REALLY

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.688
BELIEVE THAT ON THE GROUND WHEN

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:09.657
WORKING PEOPLE HAVE THAT MONEY.

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:11.959
THEY CIRCULATE THAT MONEY THEY

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:13.694
