GAMBLING IN CALIFORNIA. LEGALITY AUTHORIZATION AND REGULATION. AS I MENTIONED A COUPLE WEEKS AGO I WANTED TO USE THIS TIME BEFORE. BILL HEARINGS NEXT MONTH TO HOLD A COUPLE OF INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THOSE ISSUES THAT WILL BE COMING BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE IT DURING THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. TWO WEEKS AGO WE HELD OUR FIRST HEARING. FOCUSED ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC AND TIED ALICE LAWS. I KNOW MEMBERS OF THIS GOOD GUY COMMITTEE INCLUDING MYSELF WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF DIRECTOR APPLE SMITH'S PRESENTATION. AND WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT -- OUR STATE ALCOHOL LAWS. TODAY HOWEVER OUR FOCUS SHIFTS TO GAMBLING. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST LEGAL GAMING MARKETS IN THE WORLD. WITH SIXTY THREE TRIBAL CASINOS IN ALMOST NINETY CARD ROOMS. A STATE LOTTERY HORSE RACING IN VARIOUS FORMS OF CHARITABLE GAMING. WITH SUCH DIFFERENT FORMS OF GAMING IT'S NO SURPRISE. THAT VARIOUS STATE ENTITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING REGULATING ENFORCING GAMBLING LAWS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I'M HOPEFUL THAT TODAY'S HEARING WILL PROVIDE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION AS TO THE ROLE EACH RESPECTIVE STATE ENTITY. HAS A AND HELP US -- BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE FACING THIS COMING YEAR. LET ME THANK ALL THE WITNESSES -- IN ADVANCE FOR BEING HERE I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZING -- CAN GRADUALLY -- IN A NAY MORE. JUST LAST WEEK APPOINTED AS TRIBAL NEGOTIATIONS ADVISER BY GOVERNOR NEWSON WELCOME -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU -- IN IN THE COMING YEARS AND ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO TESTIFY ONLY ONE WEEK AFTER APPOINTMENTS. SO I APPRECIATE IT -- JUST SOME HOUSEKEEPING RULES IF WE COULD HAVE EACH WITNESS COME UP INDIVIDUALLY RATHER THAN ALL THE SAME TIME -- THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED THEY'LL BE SOME TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TOWARDS THE END OF THE HEARING. LET'S BEGIN WITH A NEED A LEAD PRINCIPLE AND FISCAL. AND POLICY ANALYST WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING ANITA. GOOD MORNING OVER IS IMMEDIATELY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE WERE ASKED TO COME TODAY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW -- TO KIND OF SET UP THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING ON THE ENDS AND THE NEXT FEW PANELS. TO THE SERGEANTS HAVE DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT THAT WE'LL BE USING AS A GUIDE FOR COMICS TODAY IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE THIS -- SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT. YOU'LL SEE THAT WILL FIRST TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF EACH OF THE MAJOR FORMS OF GAMBLING AND THEN WE'LL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS WITH SOME EMERGING ISSUES. THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL LIKELY DISCUSS OR BE HEARING ABOUT IN THE NEXT. YEAR OR SO. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND NOT WLL FOR START WITH TRIBAL GAMING. SO PROPOSITION ONE A IN TWO THOUSAND AMENDED THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. TO OPERATE SLOT MACHINES LOTTERY GAMES AND TAKING A PERCENTAGE GAMES ON TRIBAL LANDS AS LONG AS THE REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNOR THE TRIBAL STATE COMPACT. THAT CONTACT IS RATIFIED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT APPROVES IT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS RATIFIED TROUBLE STATE COMPACTS WITH SEVENTY FOUR TRIBES IN THERE ABOUT SIXTY THREE CASINOS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE STATE. THE INDUSTRY GENERALLY -- GENERATES ABOUT EIGHT BILL AFTER WINNINGS. THE STATE GENERAL FUND -- IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE ABOUT THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A DECLINE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LITTLE BIT FROM THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION THAT WAS DEPOSITED ANNUALLY. BEFORE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND THIS REALLY REFLECTS THE RENEGOTIATION OF A NUMBER OF TRIBAL STATE COMPACT TO COMPLY WITH A FEDERAL COURT ORDER WHICH BASICALLY SAID THAT UPON RENEGOTIATION OF THE CONTACTS THE STATE CAN NO LONGER REQUIRE. DEPOSITS OF REVENUE INTO THE STATE GENERAL FUND. THEN ON TOP OF THIS ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION IN REVENUE WILL SUPPORT STATE REGULATORY -- COSTS. EACH TRIBE THAT HAS A CASINO HAS THEIR OWN GAMING AGENCY THAT OVERSEES HAVE THE ON SITE REGULATORY -- RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THE CALIFORNIA GIMLI CONTROL COMMISSION AND DOJ'S BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL SHARE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRAVEL STATE COMPACTS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT WILL THEN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY. WHICH WAS AUTHORIZED BY PROPOSITION THIRTY SEVEN IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE LOTTERY OFFERS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT GAMES SOCIAL HERE PROBABLY ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL -- THEY RANGE FROM THE INSTANT GAMES LIKE THE SCRIPTURES TO THE MULTI STATE GAMES LIKE POWER BALL. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RETAILERS THAT SELL LOTTERY PRODUCTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE INDUSTRY GENERATED ABOUT. TWO POINT FIVE BILLION IN REVENUE AFTER WINNINGS. OF THIS AMOUNT ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION WILL GO TO SUPPORT EDUCATION. AND EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION OR PORT ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATORY AND PROBLEM GAMING COSTS. THE LOTTERY'S ACTIVITIES ARE OVERSEEN BY A FIVE MEMBER LOTTERY COMMISSION WITH MEMBERS THAT ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND APPROVED BY THE SENATE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HAND OUT WILL THEN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO CARD ROOMS. STATE LAW PERMITS CARD ROOMS TO OPERATE IN THOSE CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED ORDINANCES THAT PERMIT THEM TO BE THERE. IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY DO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH STATE REGULATIONS SUCH AS LICENSING REQUIREMENTS EXCITER OUT. THERE'S CURRENTLY A MORATORIUM ON THE NEW CARD ROOMS THAT CAN BE IN THE STATE AND THAT GOES THROUGH JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE CARD ROOMS CAN OFFER A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CARD GAMES THEY GENERALLY HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY THE BUREAU CAMERA CONTROL. BUT CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE POKER AND TAKE OUT -- THEY'RE CURRENTLY EIGHTY EIGHT CARD ROOMS IN THE STATE. AND THE INDUSTRY GENERATES ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND REVENUE AFTER WINNINGS. CARD ROOMS IN THEIR OWNERS ARE GENERALLY -- SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND INCOME TAX REQUIREMENTS AND THEN SEPARATE FROM THAT THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION IN FEE REVENUE THAT WILL BE COLLECTED TO OFFSET STATE REGULATORY AND PROBLEM GAMING COSTS. THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY CONTROL COMMISSION BOTH SHARE OVERSIGHT OVER THE CARD ROOMS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A LITTLE INPUT AS WELL OFF. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT WHERE THEY WILL THEN TURN OUR ATTENTION TO HORSE RACING. WHICH WAS AUTHORIZED BY PROPOSITION THREE IN. NINETEEN THIRTY THREE STATE LAW ALLOWS FOR WAGERS TO BE TAKEN ON SITE AT THE FACILITIES OFFSITE AT SATELLITE. FACILITIES -- ONLINE AS WELL AS AN OUT OF STATE LOCATIONS THEY'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN TRACKS AND SATELLITE FACILITIES THAT ACCEPT THE WAGERS AND CALIFORNIA. AND THE INDUSTRY GENERATED ABOUT SIX ON AFTER WINNINGS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SIMILAR TO THE CARD ROOMS HORSE RACE THE HORSE RACING INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO BOTH BUSINESS AND STATE INCOME TAX REQUIREMENTS. BUT ON TOP OF THIS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE STATE GENERAL FUND IS ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE ABOUT ONE MILLION DOLLARS DIRECTLY. AS WELL AS FOURTEEN MILLION IN FEE REVENUE TO SUPPORT ADMINISTRATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT COSTS. THE HORSE RACING INDUSTRY IS SIMILARLY -- GOVERNED BY A COMMISSION AT SEVEN MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX OF YOUR HAND OUT -- THIS PAGE HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF THE FOUR TYPES OF GAMBLING THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT TERRIBLE TERRIBLE ORGANIZATIONS -- OVERSIGHT IS GENERALLY DONE BY DOJ'S BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL OR THEIR CHARITABLE TRUSTS SECTION OR COMBINATION OF THE TWO AND THE CALIFORNIA AGAIN WE CONTROL COMMISSION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES HAVE OVERSIGHT AS WELL. SO THE FIRST TYPE IS THE CARD NIGHT FUNDRAISER AND SO STATE LAW AUTHORIZED CERTAIN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. TO HOST ONE CARD NIGHT FUND RAISER PER YEAR AND WHICH GAMES THAT ARE APPROVED BY THE BUREAU CAMERA CONTROL CAN BE OFFERED. 90% OF THE GROSS REVENUE DOES HAVE TO GO SUPPORT IN THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. THE SECOND IS BINGO PROPOSITION NINE OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AUTHORIZES THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AT ADOPT ORDINANCES TO OFFER BINGO WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. THE THIRD IS THAT A RAFFLES PROPOSITION SEVENTEEN IN -- TWO THOUSAND AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION TO AUTHORIZE CERTAIN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. TO CONDUCT RAFFLES WHERE 90% SIMILAR PERCENTAGE -- GOES TO SUPPORT BENEFICIAL OR CHARITABLE PURPOSES. THE LAST ONE IS THE KIND OF THE NEWEST ONE IT WHICH IS THE FIFTY FIFTY RAFFLE -- SB FIVE FORTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AUTHORIZED TO CERTAIN MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS TO OFFER RAFFLES AT HOME GAMES WHERE 50% OF THE GROSS REVENUE WENT TO SUPPORT CHERNOBYL PURPOSES AND THEN 50%. WENT TO WINNERS -- THESE RAFFLES ARE AUTHORIZED THROUGH JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IF YOU TRY TO THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT IS PAGE. SEVEN WE WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS WITH FOR EMERGING ISSUES THAT WE THINK THAT -- WILL BE SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION IN THE NEAR TERM WHETHER IT'S THE NEXT YEAR OR SO. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO A NEW SPECIAL FINE CALLED THE TROUBLE NATION GRANT FUNDS AND SO -- A NUMBER OF THE TRAVEL STATE CONTACTS REQUIRE THAT TRIBES MAKE PAYMENTS TO A SPECIAL FUND CALLED THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND OR THE RST HALF. AND THAT IS TO SUPPORT PAYMENTS TO THE STATE SINCE SEVENTY TWO NON GAMING OR LIMITED GAMING TRIBES TO ENSURE THAT THEY GET ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE SUFFICIENT PAYMENTS TO MEET THOSE OBLIGATIONS ANY EXCESS FUNDS ARE THEN AVAILABLE TO TRANSFER. TO THIS NEW FIND CALL THE TROUBLED NATION GRANT FUND FOR ALLOCATION THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS TO SUPPORT NON GAMING AND LIMITED GAMING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. THAT TROUBLING YOU CAN'T FIND WAS FIRST INCLUDED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN A NUMBER OF CONTACTS THAT STATE WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO TRANSFER INTO IT. THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO CHANGE HIS NAME THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GONNA CHANGE IN THIS COMING YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES THAT THIRTY NINE POINT THREE MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE TO TRANSFER INTO THE TRAVEL NATION CAN'T FIND. AND STATE LAW HAS BEEN ENACTED TO KIND OF DIG ALL THAT MONEY WILL GO. THE SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE EXPIRATION OF A NUMBER OF TROUBLE STATE CONTACTS TO SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE THIRTY FIVE TRIBES THAT HAVE CONTACTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE WERE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AND SO LIKELY YOU'LL HAVE RE NEGOTIATIONS OCCURRING BETWEEN NOW AND THAT. THE THIRD IS THE AUTHORIZATION OF SPORTS BETTING. THE FEDERAL PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR SPORTS PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY TWO WAS PREVIOUSLY INTERPRETED TO PROHIBIT MOST STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM AUTHORIZING WAGERING ON NEARLY ALL SPORTS -- IN MAY OF TWO OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE US SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THIS LAW IS GENERALLY ON UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THIS LED TO A NUMBER OF STATES SUCH AS NEW JERSEY AND NEW YORK. SUBSEQUENTLY AUTHORIZING SPORTS BETTING A NUMBER OF STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA STARTED HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT AND THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT KIND OF EXTENDS INTO THE NEAR TERM. THE FOURTH AND FINAL EMERGING ISSUE IS THE NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE WIRE ACT. AND SO THE FEDERAL WIRE ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY ONE GENERALLY PROHIBITS THE ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION OR PAYMENTS THAT FACILITATE THAT SIR WAGERS ACROSS THE STATE OR NATIONAL BORDERS. AND SO NOVEMBER THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ISSUED A LEGAL OPINION STATING THAT THIS PROHIBITION APPLIES TO ALL GAMBLING NOT JUST TO SPORTS WE DURING WHICH WAS HOW IT WAS INTERPRETED -- IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND SO THAT WILL LIKELY IMPACTS SOME OF YOUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FUTURE ONLINE GAMING ACTIVITIES ONLINE POKER EXCITER. SO THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE QUESTIONS BROWN. CENTER JONES. JUST REAL QUICK ON THE ON PAGE TO THE TRAVEL GAMING IN STATE REVENUE MR APOLOGIZE IF YOU DID. WITH WE WENT FROM THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TO THREE POINT SIX MILLION. YES SO -- IN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND SIX TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THERE WAS A CHANGE AND THE TERMS OF A NUMBER OF CONTACTS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED. AT THAT TIME A NUMBER OF THE COMPACTS OF CIVIC OF THE LARGEST CONTACTS BEGAN REQUIRING PAYMENTS INTO THE STATE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF THE SPECIAL FUND CALLED THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FIND -- THERE WAS LITIGATION RELATED TO THAT -- IT WAS BUT IT'S REFER TO THE RING CONN DECISION AND BASICALLY THE DECISION SAID THAT UPON RENEGOTIATION OF THOSE CONTACTS THE STATE COULD NOT REQUIRE. PAYMENTS INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND SO SINCE THEN AS THE CONTACTS HAVE BEEN RENEGOTIATED THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE DEPOSITED INTO THE GENERAL FUND HAS BEEN DECLINING AND SO NOW WE'RE AT ABOUT THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM. I THINK ABOUT TWO OR THREE TRIBES THAT ARE STILL PAYING TO THE GENERAL FUND. THOUGH IS THAT MONEY DOWN COMPLY COMPLETELY OR IT'S GOING INTO A DIFFERENT FUND NOT THE GENERAL FUND IS SO IT'S IT'S DISTRIBUTED -- TO DIFFERENT FINES AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO KIND OF DIFFERENT TERMS OF IN TERMS IN AGREEMENTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH CONTACT SO -- THERE TO FIND THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND THAT I TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS OTHER FROM THAT I REFERENCE THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND WHICH SUPPORTS THE STATE'S REGULATORY COSTS PROBLEM GAMING CAUSTIC CETERA. PRIOR TO SOME OF THESE RENEGOTIATION BOTH FUNDS HAD BEEN AN OPERATIONAL SHORTFALL WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GOING OUT. WAS EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES COMING IN AND SO IN THE RE NEGOTIATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ESSENTIALLY HAVE BEEN RIGHT SIZING THAT MAKING MORE PAYMENTS INTO THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AND THEN SIMILARLY ADJUSTING JEWEL DISTRIBUTION FIND. THIS NEW FINDS THIS TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND THAT WE KIND OF REFERENCE AS AN EMERGING ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALSO NEW PRODUCTS RELATED TO THAT AS WELL. AND SO THAT IS THE SITUATION OF TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S MORE MONEY THAT'S AVAILABLE THEN NEEDS TO BE MADE FOR THOSE ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN PAYMENTS THEY CAN THEN GO TO THESE GRANT PURPOSES. I THINK YOU WILL ALSO ALSO -- A LOT GOES LOCAL COMMUNITIES YES ENDS -- THANK YOU SO MUCH -- THERE ARE AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTIES AND CITIES -- A LOT OF THEM INCLUDE OFFSETTING AT MINIMUM THE COSTS FOR THE FOR EXAMPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT ETCETERA BUT CAN ALSO INCLUDE OTHER TERMS. RELATED TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS PARKS ETCETERA. SO RUBIO CONSIDERABLE I JUST HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF FARM AID YOU TALK ABOUT THE MERGING GAMBLING ISSUES UP FROM STATUS STATE CAN YOU EDUCATE IN TERMS OF WHAT. DO WE HAVE IN PLACE TO SAFEGUARD BETTING ACOSTA LINES -- AS A RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S KIND OF A PATCHWORK OF VARIOUS FEDERAL LAWS -- I THINK THE FEDERAL WIRE ACT AS ONE ANOTHER ONE SPECIFICALLY IT YOU YOU EACH YEAH I I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT WHAT THAT ACRONYM STANDS FOR BUT IT RELATES TO UNLAWFUL CAN INTERACT ACTIVITY -- SO THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE EVENTUALLY. THEN WITHIN THE STATE REALLY GAMBLING CONTROL AND IT'S KIND OF THE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES LETTER THERE ARE KIND OF RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING AND KIND OF FOCUSING ON THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR PRESENTATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALAN. IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH -- THERE'S THE STATE'S NOT REALLY GAINING MUCH BY WAY OF REVENUE STATE OR LOCAL. ONE WITH THE REST OF THIS. CAN WE HAPPY IN THE STATE I MEAN EVER EVERYTHING MOST THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT YOU MENTIONED WERE WERE OFFSETS RIGHT I MEAN WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE. A REGULATORY SYSTEM FOR PROBLEM GAME IF WE DIDN'T HAVE GAMING. WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE ACTUAL POLICE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES IF WE DIDN'T HAVE -- MINUTE FOR GAMING THERE SO CAN YOU GIVE IT. ARE ARE WE NOW AT LEAST. MAKING MONEY OR OR THE SORRY WE AT LEAST LIKE LIKE BREAKING EVEN SOUNDS LIKE BEFORE WE WERE LITERALLY THE STATE WAS SUBSIDIZING. GAMING. SO I THINK WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF GAMING THERE ARE DIFFERENT GOALS -- AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TRIBAL GAMING. KIND OF THE IMPETUS BEHIND TRIBAL GAMING IS REALLY THE SELF SUFFICIENCY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRACKS IS RENT THAT'S ONE CALL -- THEN IF YOU TURN YOUR ATTENTION FOR EXAMPLES THE CALIFORNIA STATE LOTTERY ON THAT -- ONE ABOUT IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION WILL GO TO EDUCATION -- AND SO THAT IS SOME SUCH A WAY THAT THE STATE BENEFITS. I THINK IN IN THE OTHER IN SOME OF THE OTHER GAMING INDUSTRIES FOR EXAMPLE LIKE CARD ROOMS AND FORCED AND THE HORSE RACING INDUSTRY. THEY ARE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND INCOME TO CAPTURE AT THIS MOMENT SO I CAN'T REALLY TELL YOU FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS IN MY TESTIMONY THAT CARD ROOMS GENERATED ACTS MILLION. AND TAX REVENUE I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RESEARCHERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY -- AND SO THERE IS REVENUE THAT COMES IN THERE THERE'S ALSO REVENUE THAT. CAN COME IN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK THEY'RE CONSTANTLY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THERE IS ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CITIES AND COUNTIES IN WHICH THESE ENTITIES -- OPERATE. I THINK YOU YOU DO KIND OF CAPTURE KIND OF THE FLIP SIDE WHICH IS THERE ARE COSTS. RELATE AND MOST NOTABLY RELATED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT EAT A LOT OF THE AGREEMENTS KIND OF FOCUS ON KIND OF AT LEAST OFFSETTING THE COSTS. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DO WE WHAT SORT OF TAXATION. OF GAMBLING PROFITS ARE WE ENGAGING IN FOR THESE VERY SECTORS. OF WHAT MOVES BESIDES FOR FOR SUPER PROFITS NOT JUST OFFSETS ACCUSER IS THERE A OBVIOUSLY THERE'S INCOME TAX ASSOCIATE WITH ANYONE WHO WORKS IN ANY OF THESE PLACES BUT IS THERE LIKE A IS THERE ANY KIND OF BUSINESS PROFITS TAX FOR A CASINO OR FOR A CARD ROOM. THAT'S ONLINE WITH WHAT A TYPICAL BUSINESS WOULD PAY. IS SO FOR THE CARD ROOMS ENDS FOR HORSE RACING A PARTICULAR SUBJECT TO THE SAME BUSINESS AND INCOME TAX REQUIREMENTS THAT OTHER BUSINESSES -- AND BUSINESS OWNERS ARE SUBJECT TO SO IT'S NOT A SPECIAL TAX AT LEAST NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IS A LOT OF SPECIAL TAX. BE DO HEY VARIOUS LICENSING FEES EXCITER ON TOP OF THAT -- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION FOR THE CASINOS. THERE'S NOT A BUSINESS TAX THEY DON'T HAVE A THE GAS SO IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE ONLY THE PAYMENTS IS THROUGH IS THROUGH THIS -- WHETHER THEY'RE SEVEN ASIAN BUT THERE ARE I THINK THERE'S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES GOING ON ON THE RESERVATIONS THAT ARE STILL LIVES SUBJECT TO OTHER INTO TAXATION. SO THE THERE'S THE SOVEREIGN NATION ISSUE -- TO THE EXTENT THAT IT GENERATES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SO FOR EXAMPLE THEYHAVE A CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL PROVIDER IN CITY A CITY A WILL BE PORTANTINO. WILL BE PAYING TAXES -- NORMALLY AS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS OP. RIGHT BUT I THINK IN IT THE BROADER ISSUE IS WITH TRIBES GENERALLY THE AMOUNT OF OBLIGATIONS THAT THEY PAY WHETHER IT'S AN TO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH WE'VE ESTABLISHED IS NOT VERY MUCH AT THIS POINT OR INTO ANY OF THE OTHER SPECIAL FUND IT'S REALLY GOVERNED BY THE TRIBAL. STATE COMPACT IN TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED BETWEEN THE TRIBE AND THE STATE. MMHM IT A DEAD ON THAT SENATOR -- LIKE ON THE LARGE CARD ROOMS -- CENTER BRADFORD CENTER ARCHER LE LET HAVE A NUMBER THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITIES -- FIVE OR SIX MAYBE EVEN SEVEN COMMUNITIES -- THEY SUPPORT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FORTY AND 70% OF THEIR LOCAL BUDGETS. SO I MEAN IT'S IT'S IT'S ALIVE AGAIN COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY LIST YES. TO NAME A COUPLE. BUT AND IF I MAY ADD UP I THINK YOU AND LIKE TO MACULA TO PAY ALMOST A 100% OF LIKE. PUBLIC SAFETY ADAM AND TOWN POLICING CELL. SOME OF THEM PAY A 100%. THERE ARE TWO LETTER YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOING BACK TO THE CARDS IN THE CONTRIBUTION THAT THE MAKE THE CARTILAGE MAKE TO THE COMMUNITIES. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE CARD. CLUBS IN THE LA COUNTY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES OVERALL -- I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT MY FINGERTIPS I THINK -- CARD ROOMS VERY I THINK FROM CITY FROM CITY TO CITY AND COUNTY TO COUNTY AND SO THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED WERE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STUFF ON IT WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY THAT. SOMEBODY CARD CLUBS IN LA COUNTY -- SUCH AS THE ONES IN A THIRTY SECOND SENATE DISTRICT -- CONTRIBUTE UP TO SIX OF THE BUDGET OF THOSE CITIES IS THAT SOUND FAIR WITH TO INCLUDE FIRE POLICE SAID. IN EMPLOYMENT WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU IF ANYBODY ELSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WILL CALLED STACY LUNA BAXTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION [inaudible] GOOD MORNING [inaudible] ST. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DODD MEMBERS THINK ORDER HAVING ME HERE TODAY AGAIN I'M STACY LINDA BAXTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION. CARTER AND HAVE OPERATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS BUT IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL ACT WAS ENACTED TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE STRUCTURE. FOR THE STATEWIDE REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL CARDROOM GAMING. PRIOR TO THIS TIME THE STATE REGULATION OF CARD ROOMS WAS MINIMAL. THE CALIFORNIA GAMING CONTROL ACT ESTABLISH A BIFURCATED SYSTEM OF REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT WITH THE COMMISSION AS A REGULATORY. ENERGY TO KATORI AGENCY. AND THE BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A ROLE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL. THERE ARE CURRENTLY EIGHTY SEVEN CARD ROOMS AND SIXTY THREE TRIBAL CASINOS OPERATING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TOGETHER THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE CREATED PROXIMALLY EIGHTY THOUSAND JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS. BEFORE DISCUSSING THE SPECIFIC ROLE THE COMMISSION IN REGULATING THESE TWO SECTORS I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ROLE FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA GAMELY CONTROL ACT LOCAL TO ENACT A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL. AND IMPOSE ANY LOCAL TAX OR LICENSE FEE ON CARTER AND SAYS IN THAT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE ACT. IN ADDITION CARD ON GAMBLING MUST BE APPROVED BY A LOCAL GAMING ORDINANCE. THE ACT OR THE AUTHORIZES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO REGULATE THE LOCATIONS HOURS NUMBER OF TABLES AND WAGERING LIMITS OF GAMING PROMISES. MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO ISSUE WORKMEN'S FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF A GAMING ESTABLISHMENTS AS REQUIRED BY THE ACT. HOWEVER SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES IN IN THOSE SITUATIONS THE COMMISSION HANDLES THAT WORKLOAD. EXISTING LAW PLACES THE MORATORIUM ON THE EXPANSION OF GAMBLING WITHIN CARTONS IN ON NEW LICENSES FOR GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS. THE MORATORIUM HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION. AND HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY EXTENDED. THE CURRENT SUNSET DATE WAS EXTENDED TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY WITH THE JOB. BECAUSE I DO DASCHLE POWERS UNDER THE ACT COMMISSIONERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION BY THE SENATE. THE COMMISSION CONSISTS OF FIVE MEMBERS THE ACT INCLUDES VARIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION TO ENSURE INTEGRITY AND DECISION MAKING. AND PREVENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE COMMISSION HAS A REGULATORY ROLE WITHIN THE COMMISSION SENT THE CARD ROOM INDUSTRY AND TRIBAL GAMING. BOTH OF WHOM CONTRIBUTE TO SPECIAL FUNDS THAT COVER THE COSTS OF OPERATIONS AT THE COMMISSION IN THE BEER OF GAMBLING CONTROL. FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE COMMISSION IS AUTHORIZED FOR THIRTY SEVEN POSITIONS AND A TOTAL FNDING A SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AS IT RELATES TO THE CARD ROOM INDUSTRY THE COMMISSION AS A DECISION MAKING BODY OVER GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS KNOWN AS CARD ROOMS AND A THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS A PROPOSITION PLAYER SERVICES BUSINESSES. CARTONS CAN OFFER NON BANK TABLE GAMES PROVED BY THE BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL WHICH MEANS THAT IN A CARTER AND THE PLAYERS PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER NOT THE CARD ROOM. OR THE HOUSE AS IS REFER TO IN TRADITIONAL NEVADA STYLE GAMBLING. LICENSE BUSINESSES THAT PROVIDE SERVICES IN AN TO THE CARD ROOMS UNDER AN AGREEMENT APPROVED BY THE BUREAU OF GAMBLING CONTROL. THE COMMISSION IS ALSO THE DECISION MAKING BODY OVER ALL PERSONS IN TRANSACTIONS REGARDING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CARTOONS AND THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. AND DETERMINES THE SUITABILITY OF LICENSE HER FOR KIßM PLEASE WITHIN THE CARD ROOMS AND% EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE THIRD PARTY BUSINESSES. APPLICANTS ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERGO A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION COMPLETED BY THE BUREAU GAMING CONTROL AFTER WHICH THE BUREAU'S INVESTIGATIVE REPORT IS PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION. FOR THE COMMISSIONER'S CONSIDERATION TERMINATION OF SUITABILITY AT A PUBLIC MEETING. THE COMMISSION'S ROLE IS TO TAKE REASONABLE ACTIONS TO ENSURE THAT NO IN ELIGIBLE OR UNSUITABLE PERSONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROLLED GAMBLING ACTIVITIES. THE COMMISSION IS ALSO VESTED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AS CONSISTENT WITH THE GAMING CONTROL ACT. AS IT RELATES TO TRIBAL GAMBLING THE COMMISSION HAS LIMITED REGULATORY AUTHORITY AS DIVINE DEFINED BY THE TRIBAL STATE COMPACTS NEGOTIATED BY THE GOVERNOR AND APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE CONSISTENT. WITH THE STATE COMPACTS TRIBES IN THEIR TRIBAL GAMING AGENCIES ARE THE PRIMARY REGULAR THAT REGULATORS OF TRIBAL GAMING. THE COMMISSION MAKES FINDING THE SUITABILITY TERMINATIONS FOR TRIBAL KEY EMPLOYEES VENDORS. AND CERTAIN FINANCIAL SOURCES. THIS PROCESS IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE COMMISSION'S ROLE WITH THE CARD ROOMS IN THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. THE COMMISSION ALSO SERVES AS THE ADMINISTRATOR TO THREE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES AS YOU HEARD EARLIER. THE INDIAN GAMING SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUN THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. AND THE TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUN. FINALLY THE COMMISSION HAS A LIMITED ROLE IN DEVELOPING REGULATIONS RELATED TO THE COMPACT IN CORONATION WITH THE TRIBAL STATE ASSOCIATIONS.

AND ALSO ANOTHER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE OF THE PROBLEM GAMBLING -- COUNSELING CENTERS AND THEIR THEIR EFFORTS FOR PROBLEM GAMBLING.

AXES A THIRD NEUTRAL PARTY BETWEEN ALL THE GAMBLING ENTITIES BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. TO NEGOTIATING ISSUES OR PROBLEMS THAT MAY HAVE. WE CERTAINLY TRY TO FILL THAT ROLE WE DO ALSO HAVE A GAMING POLICY ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CARTER INSIDE NOT THE TRIBAL SIDE -- IS A FORM IN WHICH THEY CAN BRING ISSUES UP FOR OUR CONSIDERATION UNDER THE COMMISSION. AND COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU'VE BEEN. IN THAT THIRD IN OUR THIRD NEUTRAL PARTY ROLE IN BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. WELL WE HAVE -- WHEN THERE ARE ISSUES THAT COME UP WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY -- OBVIOUSLY ONE WAY OF OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES MIGHT BE THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND IN THOSE REGULATORY PROCESS WE OFFER A VERY OPEN A FORM IN WHICH THE STAKE HOLDERS. ARE ABLE TO PRIDE COMMENTS TO AN EXTRA EARNS. WE HOLD MULTIPLE WORKSHOPS WHEN ANY OF THOSE ISSUES TO COME UP -- BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GO INTO THE OFFICIAL RULE MAKING PROCESS.

CHAIRMAN YES SIR RUBIO AS I HAVE A QUESTION I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE SENATOR I RATED SOMEWHERE BUT I KNOW THAT SOME FUNDING GOALS -- TO AS TRY AND I HELP PEOPLE WITH GAMBLING ADDICTION. AND CAN YOU. GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION TERMS OF THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED TO SEE WHAT THOSE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE WHAT COMMUNITIES ARE MORE IMPACTED. AND HOW THAT MONEY SPENT TO HELP OUT WITH THAT ADDICTION SURE -- I CAN'T THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE AGAIN THE OFFICE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING IS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- I DO KNOW FOR EXAMPLE MARCH IS PUBLIC AWARENESS FOR PROBLEM GAMBLING MONTH AND THEY PROVIDE A NUMBER OF STATISTICAL DATA -- ACTUALLY TO THE COMMISSION IN OUR NEXT FEEDING OUR PUBLIC MEETING SO WILL ACTUALLY BE RECEIVING THAT STATISTICAL INFORMATION OURSELVES BUT THEY DO GATHER INFORMATION IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF COUNCILLORS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO OFFER SERVICES -- THE VARIANCE OF LANGUAGES THAT THE TARGET IN TERMS OF AREAS THAT THEY HAVE -- PROVIDED STUDIES THAT NEED THAT THEY ALSO PROVIDE STATISTICS AS TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THEIR TREATMENT SERVICES -- BUT THAT WOULD ALL BE UNDER THE OFFICE OF PROBLEM GAMBLING. DO WE GET THAT NATURALLY AS A BODY OR DO WE HAVE TO WILL SEEK OUT THE INFORMATION. I AM NOT CERTAIN IF THEY HAVE MANDATORY REPORTS THAT THEY NEED TO REPORT TO YOU BUT I'M WELCOME I I'D BE WILLING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AN ADDITIONAL. A IN IN REFERENCE TO SECURITY AND AN INDIA ALL THE ESTABLISHMENT SCISSORS STANDARDS THAT YOU OVERSEE TO MAKE SURE THAT AN OF PERSONNEL -- PUBLIC COMPLAINTS ISSUES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE WHEN YOU GET INTO PUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY. PARKING AREAS AND SECURITY LEVELS PARKING AREAS AND SO ON YEAH OVERALL SECURITY YES THREE BE GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION HAS PROMULGATED REGULATIONS THAT ESTABLISH MINIMAL INTERNAL CONTROLS FOR EACH OF THE CARD ROOMS THAT. HAVE -- REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARDS TO SURVEILLANCE -- RESPONSIBILITIES SECURITY OF THAT SUCH YES -- GOOD THANK YOU. SIR WILK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A DURING YOUR COMMENTS YOU MNTIONED THAT THE TWO TRIBES SIR RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN LICENSING SO THAT DOES NOT FALL UNDER. THE AUSPICES OF THE STATE SO I'M CURIOUS HOW THE CALIFORNIA GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION THE BUREAU OF GAMING CONTROL -- DECIDES ON THE PRO RATED SHARE. OF TERRY COSTS FOR IT INDIAN TRIBES. SO THAT IS OUTLINED WITHIN THE TRIBAL STATE NEGOTIATIONS ON IS HANDLED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU IS JUST A PROUDER PERRETTA SHARE THAT IS EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONGST THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FINE. NUMBER LICENSING AND AND SO THERE'S THERE'S NO -- CALCULATIONS AND STATE ALREADY DO THEIR LICENSING IS THERE IS EVERY PAYING THE SAME SAME AMOUNT EVEN THOUGH. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN LICENSING. FOR INDIVIDUALS CONTRIBUTING HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL STATE REGULATORY COSTS IN WHICH THOSE TO GO TO FIND. BECAUSE THE TRIBAL STATE COMPACTS ALSO REQUIRE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN LICENSED BY THE TRIBE. THAT THEY STILL HAVE TO COME FORWARD FOR FINDING OF SUITABILITY WITH THE STATE RIGHT THANK YOU. UP I'M KIND OF A QUESTION YOU KNOW THE CARD INDUSTRY -- CARD ROOM INDUSTRY IS EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM OF LICENSING ENFORCEMENT. BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND THE BUREAU OFTEN -- CAUSES SOME DELAYS. I'M WONDERING WHAT YOUR TAKE ON THAT IS IF THT'S IN FACT THE CASE IN THE NET WHAT'S RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE BEER ON THE COMMISSION. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BUREAU AND THE COMMISSION -- WE DO WORK IN CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER ON ARE MATTERS THAT WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OF WHEN APPROPRIATE. I I DON'T THINK IT IT'S BEEN A SECRET THAT THERE'S BEEN A BACKLOG WITHIN THE BUREAU FAMILY CONTROL WITH REGARDS TO PROCESSING APPLICATIONS WHICH WILL LIKELY SPEAK UPON WHEN THEY'RE UP HERE. AYE WITH REGARDS TO ONCE HE GETS TO THE COMMISSION'S WE WE DO BE ARE MANDATORY TIME FRAMES IN ORDER -- TO PUT THOSE IN FRONT OF THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE DECISION. BYE BYE YES WITH THE BIFURCATED SYSTEM. AS THE BUREAU GAMBLING CONTROL HANDLES CERTAIN. THE REGULATION AND THE COMMISSION HANDLES THE OTHER. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY THE I THINK IT'S OKAY. IT DOES. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES. SO LARGE LEAD WHEN ADDITIONAL QUESTION TANK YOU SO MUCH DO YOU -- AS COMMISSIONER EVER -- INVITE THE MAYORS OF EACH OF THE CITIES OR THE CITY MANAGER TO BEACHES CITIES TO COME TOGETHER WITH YOU JUST. TO BE BRIEFED ON WHAT YOU'RE UP TO THE COMMISSION'S UP TO AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THEM WITHIN THEIR CITIES AND AND THE CARD CLUBS IN THIS CASE -- WERE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER TO EVER HOLD TYPE OF FOR INFORMATIONAL -- HEARINGS I GUESS YOU'D CALL. WE HAVE NOT -- OVER THE MOST RECENT PASS I CAN'T RECALL THAT WE'VE DONE SPECIFICALLY THAT HOWEVER -- WITHIN THE THE GAINING POLICY ADVISORY COMMITTEE THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE POSITION THAT IS -- IDENTIFIED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ON TO COME IN AND HOLD THAT C. M. BRING FORWARD ANY ISSUES THAT THOSE LOCALS MIGHT HAVE. AND AGAIN WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PUBLIC FORMS IN WHICH THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL COMING MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. WOULDN'T IT BE A GOOD IDEA PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE FOR YOURSELF TAKING THE LEAD TO BRING IN IN THE CITY MANAGER'S AND MAYORS. EACH OF THESE COMMUNITIES SO YOU CAN HAVE FIRST HAND INFORMATION AND HOW THEY'RE AFFECTING THE COMMUNITIES AND NOW THEY'RE INVOLVED. NOT ONLY PUBLIC SAFETY BUT COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND BECAUSE WE HEARD EARLIER THAT -- SO MANY THE CARD CLUBS PARTICIPATE SO MUCH WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES AND EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS AND AND THE IMPACT IT MAY HAVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES.

THE SESSION CONSIST OF THE CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING PROGRAM REGULATIONS AND LEGISLATION UNIT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION GAMBLING FUND RATE SIR REGISTRATION PROGRAM. AND THE MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS TRAVEL PROGRAM. NOW GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE QUICKLY. TO THE CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT WAS ESTABLISHED TO COLLECT COLLATE ANALYZE AND DISSEMINATE INFORMATIONS TO COURTROOMS IN TROUBLE CASINOS. REGARDING INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED CRIMES IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY TO IDENTIFY CRIME TRENDS AND CONDUCT OTHER TEST YOU NEED TO INTELLIGENCE GATHERING. TO THE UNIT DISSEMINATES -- BULLETINS FOR PARTNERS LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOLKS IN THE GAMBLING INDUSTRY. TO AN ATTEMPT TO WORK TOGETHER TO ASCERTAIN INFORMATION VITAL TO ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS INTO CRIMES SEVERAL TALKING TOGETHER. THE BEARS RESPONSIBILITIES AS A PERTAINS RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING INCLUDE ADMINISTRATION AT THE STATE WHAT EXCLUSION PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM WHEREBY INDIVIDUALS CAN VOLUNTARILY EXCLUDE THEMSELVES FROM CARTONS IN THE STATE. THEY MAINTAINED EXCLUSION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS A DATABASE WHICH PROVIDES A CLEARINGHOUSE OF INFORMATION FOR COURTROOMS TO VERIFY A PATRON SELF EXCLUSION STATUS -- DISSEMINATION OF RESPONSIBLE GAMING INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVOLUNTARY EXCLUSION LIST. REGULATIONS LEGISLATION UNIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMULGATING REGULATIONS -- AND FACILITATING COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE BUREAU TO THE COMMISSION FOR THEIR REGULATIONS. IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR TRACKING LEGISLATION AND PROVIDING BILL ANALYSES. THE CHARITABLE GAMING SECTION CAN REGISTER AS QUALIFIED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPLIERS OF A QUICK MINUTE SERVICES. FOR FUND RAISING EVENTS THAT USE CONTROL GAMES SUCH AS PROGRAM HIGH GO. TO RAISE FUNDS FOR CHARITIES. THERE OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHARITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER TO CONDUCT CONTROL GAMES AS A FUND RAISING MECHANISM -- DURING FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE BEER RECEIVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY APPLICATIONS AND REGISTER THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THE BEER ALSO CURRENTLY HAS RESPONSIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING THE MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS RENTAL PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM ALLOWS ELIGIBLE ORGANIZATIONS TO CONDUCT RAFFLES AND MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS HOME GAMES IN THE STATE OR BY 50% OF THE GROSS RECEIPTS GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF THE ROCKETS TICKETS. MUST BE USED TO BENEFIT PROVIDE SUPPORT THIS AND THE OTHER 50% MUST BE PAID TO THE WINNER WHICH IS COMMON BY A MANUAL DROPPED THE GAMES. THE BUREAU REGISTERS ELIGIBLE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS AND IS AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT AUDITS IN A FORCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT PROVIDED OF FUNDING FOR ANY OF ITS AUDIT ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REGISTRATION FEES THREE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS -- THIS PAST DECEMBER AND WE'RE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE REGULAR RULEMAKING PROCESS FOR THOSE FEES. SO THAT IS WHAT THE BUREAU DOES THERE'S A FEW -- ISSUES THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT -- FIRST OF ALL WE ARE FACING A POTENTIAL LOSS OF THIRTY TWO POSITIONS THE LICENSING SECTION -- IN FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE BEER OBTAIN TWELVE POSITIONS TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG OF LICENSING APPLICATIONS. OF THE FOLLOWING YOUR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THE BUREAU WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY POSITIONS FOR THIS PURPOSE. A WE THINK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THOSE POSITIONS ARE VERY HELPFUL. OF THE ADDITION OF THE POSITIONS CONTRIBUTED TOWARD THE ACTION IN THE LICENSING BACKLOG -- SO FOR EXAMPLE IN JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE WAS A BACKLOG OF THREE THOUSAND TWENTY NINE APPLICATIONS. AFTER THE ADDITION OF THE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS IN THE RECORD ONBOARDING TRAINING THE BACKLOG WAS JUST CREASE TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN APPLICATIONS BY JUNE. THE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS INITIALLY PROCESS THE LESS COMPLICATED APPLICATIONS AND HAVE RECENTLY TRANSITIONED TO PROCESSING THE MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ONCE. WHILE THESE POSITIONS WERE FULL TIME PERMANENT THE BUREAU HAS ONLY RECEIVED LIMITED -- LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THEM WHICH BASICALLY HAS THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF MAKING THEM FUNCTION AS TEMPORARY POSITIONS. SO THE CURRENT PROPOSED BUDGET DOES NOT CONTAIN FUNDING FOR THOSE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS. WE'RE CURRENTLY DETERMINE HOW THIS WILL AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG AS WELL AS OUR ONGOING WORKLOAD -- AND IT AND THE EFFECT IT'LL ACTUALLY HAVE ON OUR STAFF -- ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT TO THE WORKLOAD A STAFF WHO WERE IN THE LIMITED FUNNY POSITIONS BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR AN EXIT MORE STABLE EMPLOYMENT ELSEWHERE AND HOW THAT WILL AFFECT. THE CURRENT WORKLOAD. SO WE ASKED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO HELP US CONTINUE ARE POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE BACKLOG. AN ONGOING WORKLOAD BY SUPPORTING FUNDING FOR THOSE THIRTY TWO POSITIONS. BUT WE ARE VIEWING BLACKJACK TYPE GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN THE PAST FOR CAR DREAMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE TOO SIMILAR TO TWENTY ONE BLACKJACK GAMES WHICH PROHIBITED BY STATE LAW. WE HAVE ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS AND DISCUSSIONS ON THIS MATTER TO ENSURE THEY ARE PRIZED OF OUR INTENTIONS. ON IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SERRA MET WITH KHARTOUM REPRESENTATIVES TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS. AFTER I ASSUME THE BUDGET POSITION AS DIRECTOR. BUT TURNING JOURNAL AND I MET WITH BOTH CARDROOM REPRESENTATIVES AND TROUBLE GAMING REPRESENTATIVES IN MAY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS. AT THIS MEETING WE INDICATED THAT WE WOULD HOLD OFF ON TAKING ACTION. ON CERTAIN ISSUES AT ITS IT APPEAR THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING POSSIBLE LEGISLATION ON CERTAIN ISSUES. THAT MAY CLARIFY THE LAW ON VARIOUS MATTERS. SO WE WERE HOPEFUL THAT CERTAIN ISSUES LIKE THE PLAYER DEALER ROTATION ISSUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED -- AND RESOLVE THROUGH LEGISLATION. A THEREAFTER THOUGH IN AUGUST WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE -- ANY LEGISLATION I MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES ROM CARD ROOMS THEIR PARTY PROVIDERS IN TROUBLE -- GAMING TRIBES OUTLINED VARIOUS ISSUES THEY PLAN TO ADDRESS INCLUDING THE BLACK JACK ISSUE -- IN PROVIDED A A WRITTEN SUMMARY TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE DISCUSSIONS. IN DECEMBER WE INVITED THOSE REPRESENTATIVES TO MEANS TO PROVIDE UPDATES ON THOSE MATTERS. WE HAVE ALSO MET WITH INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT GAME OWNERS A LEGISLATIVE STAFF -- AS WELL AS PARTICIPATED IN MEDIAN AND CALLS WITH INDIVIDUALS TO HEAR THEIR CONCERNS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO LET INDUSTRY NOW AND INDUSTRY AND OTHERS KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE BLACK JACK ISSUE. WE'RE ALSO WORKING A REGULATIONS TO HIM DRESS HOW CERTAIN GAMES ARE PLAYED IN CARD ROOMS. THE ISSUE WE ARE ADDRESSING IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ROTATION OF THE PLAYER DEALER POSITION -- THUS FAR WE HAVE HELD FIVE PUBLIC WORKSHOPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO IN. OBTAIN INPUT ON THE REGULATIONS -- BUT HAVE ONE ACTUALLY SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK IN RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA. THE REQUESTED AND RECEIVED SOME WRITTEN INPUT ON THE ISSUE AND WE THEM ALL TO THE BUREAU'S WEBSITE -- AND WE FOR FROM HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS MOSTLY FROM THOSE WHO WORKING HARD JONES AND FOR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS REGARDING THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE REGULATIONS. WE PLAN TO HAVE DRAFT REGULATIONS AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AND DISCUSSION IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. AND AFTER WE RECEIVE FREE PIANO AND ANALYZE ALL THOSE COMMENTS POSSIBLY HOLD ADDITIONAL WORKSHOPS -- WAS WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE REGULATIONS CAN MOVE FORWARD WE WILL BEGIN VERY INFORMAL RULEMAKING PROCESS. THAT WILL INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THOSE REGULATIONS. TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR QUITE SOME TIME IN OUR COMPLEX. I SHOULD ANY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WHICH HAD INDIVIDUAL BRIEFINGS DO SO. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO IN IN TALKING ABOUT THE BACKLOG ON APPLICATIONS AT WHAT POINT IN TIME. AND WHAT YEAR DID YOU NOT HAVE A PROBLEM AND WHAT IS OCCURRED SINCE THAT TIME. THAT THIS BACKLOG HAS BEEN CONSISTENT I THINK WE'RE CONTINUALLY ASSESSING THAT TWENTY NATIONALLY BROUGHT PEOPLE WANTED TO SOMETIME TO HIRE TO ON BIRD INTO TRAIN. AND WE STARTED THEM OFF WITH THE MOST KIND OF THE THE EASIEST APPLICATIONS TO GO THROUGH -- SO THE BACK LIKE I THINK TOOK A KIND OF A STEEP DIVE AND RATE THE ARE SEEN A LITTLE BIT OF LEVELING JUST BECAUSE NOW SOME OF THOSE ANALYSTS ARE HANDLING THE ONES THAT TAKE A LONG TIME INSTEAD OF HANDLING. LIKE FORTY FOUR AND FOR AN EASY IN A WORK PERMIT NOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE MONTHS PERHAPS FOR LIKE IN A CAR ROOM -- OWNER LICENSE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT TO SEE I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT DATE OF WEN WE THINK WE'LL HIT WHERE IT'S JUST YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG. BUT WE ARE HAVE BEEN MAKING PROGRESS ON IT. IT IS IT THAT YOU'VE NEVER NEVER HAD THE STAFFING THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE OR IS IT THAT DAY IT I KNOW YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT WE DID THE INCREASE ONE WE DID. IS IT THAT WE NEED A PERMANENT INCREASE OR IS IT THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS. AND THAT WILL LEVEL OFF I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP US GET THROUGH JUST SO THAT WE COULD HAVE -- YOU KNOW INSTEAD OF PUT SEVERAL PEOPLE WANT TO GET THINGS THAT ARE MORE COMPLICATED GET THROUGH IT -- BUT THOSE THOSE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE THERE ARE PROMINENT POSITIONS IT JUST CAME WITH LIMITED TERM FUNDING SO. IT LOOKING FORWARD TO SECOND GUESS THE STABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN KEEP THOSE FOLKS TO CONTINUE THE THE WORKLOAD AND THE BACKLOG. WORKING THANK YOU ARE ON THIS ON THIS POINT. IT'S IT'S PUZZLING TO ME SINCE NONE OF THIS MONEY COMES FROM THE GENERAL FUND. IN THE MONEY COMES FROM THE TRIBES AND THE CARD ROOMS. IN THIS CASE CARD ROOMS AT WHY THEIR LIMITED TERM. POSITIONS I MEAN THAT THIS IS A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING THESE FUNDS IN AND IT JUST IT'S PUZZLING TO ME WHY IS IS IS THAT JUST THE OLD THE OLD ADMINISTRATION AND MAYBE THIS ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO LOOK AT THAT. THE DIFFERENTLY I I I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WAY AND IT'S NOT GENERAL FUND MONEY IT'S MONEY COMING FROM THE INDUSTRY. THE WORLD DEFINITELY WILLING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON IT ON YOUR RIGHT THAT THE FUNDS DO COME AGAIN CONTROL FUND NOT THE GENERAL FUND -- SO THOSE POSITIONS IN THE PAST JUST RECEIVE LIMITED TERM FUNDING SO AGAIN WE'RE JUST LOOKING TO CONTINUE THE FUNDING TO KEEP THE THE FOLKS. IN OUR APPLICATIONS SHEET THAT MAN IF I MAY I HAVE THE SAME QUESTION BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE REPORT THAT WE RECEIVED TWENTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION. ARE PROJECTED TO BE RECEIVED CORRECT AND IT SAYS IT SUPPORTS. OUR STATE REGULATORY AND PROBLEM GAINING COSTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INDUSTRY SO. I'M WONDERING DO WE HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH -- HOW DO WE GET THE SUB THIRTY TWO POSITIONS THAT YOU DISCUSS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE USING HOW DO WE MAKE A PART OF? THE FUNDING THAT GOES. TO TO SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY RIGHT. SO I GUESS THAT'S WHY THEY WERE REQUESTING ASSISTANCE FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO JUST ON THE FUNDING ISSUE. AGAIN WE DO HAVE THE THE POSITIONS ARE NOT LIMITED TO POSITIONS THAT JUST GO AWAY ONCE THE FUNDING YOU KNOW. GOES WAY BUT WE WE DO NEED TO TO HAVE AN ON GOING FUNDING SOURCE FOR THEM [inaudible] CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU MISSION FROM OTHER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION MY QUESTION RELATES -- TO BLACK JACK IN THE HOUSE BANK MEAN A PLAYER BANK GAMES. AND WHAT IS HAPPENED IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT HAS CHANGED THE WHOLE PERSPECTIVE OF A GAME THAT HAS BEEN PLAYED. FOR TWENTY YEARS EXPRESSION CITY A GUARDINO WARM FROM WHERE THERE'S BEEN NO ISSUE OF CRIME CONCERN AND WHAT I'M JUST CURIOUS. THREE PREVIOUS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S NEVER. SO. I GUESS I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND I CAN ONLY KIND OF SPEAK TO THE HISTORY THAT I KNOW BUT I KNOW THAT BEFORE I ASSUME THE POSITION BEFORE EVEN -- THE CREDIT CHECK ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAME AG THAT THE BUREAU STAFF HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF BLACK JACK WHICH IS TWENTY ONE THE BLACKJACK IS PROHIBITED BY THE PENAL CODE. SO WHAT WE SAID GIVEN THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OF THOSE GAMES -- AND LET THE INDUSTRY KNOW OUR INTENTIONS SO WE ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THAT REVIEW PROCESS -- TO SEE WHICH ONES WE THINK WERE PROHIBITED AND LET THE INDUSTRY NOW SO. I CAN'T SPEAK TO KIND OF THE THE THOUGHT PROCESS OR THE PINIONS OF THE PRIOR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTS TO JUST ENSURE THAT WE ARE ENFORCING THE LAW SINCE OUR RESPONSIBILITY. SOCIAL WE INTERPRET THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ENFORCING THE LAW. I WANT TO SAY THAT IS SPECIAL WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS OF THAT FROM SAN NOTHING HAS CHANGED THE WAY THESE GAMES HAVE BEEN PLAYED I'VE. GREW UP WITH THESE CARD ROOMS IN THE CITY OF GARDENA AND I WATCHED EVOLUTION I WAS ON CITY COUNCIL WHEN THEY STARTED CALIFORNIA FORMER BLACK JACK AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT A JOB IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS IS DIFFERENT THAN. WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS DISCOURAGE? CENTER ARTS A LOT OF YES THANK YOU IN A DIFFERENT YOU'VE DISCUSSED SO MANY ISSUES I'M JUST GONNA TRY AND BREAK DOWN A COUPLE. THAT COME TO MIND YOU MENTION YOUR DIVISIONAL STAFF THAT YOU NEED -- BEEN THE QUESTION IS SHOULD WE LOOK FOR PERMANENT STAFFING -- INFLUX OF FUNDING SURE YOU COULD GET CAUGHT UP. THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR YOU HAVE LEVEL. THE OTHER THINGS SPEAKING OF LEVELS -- THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION REFERENCES SECURITY -- IN THE CARD CLUBS -- HYPOTHETICALLY SOMEONE IS WORKING THE TABLE SOMEONE'S WORKING SOMEWHERE ELSE SOMEONE'S WORK IN THE BACK ARE THERE LEVELS OF SECURITY CLEARANCES -- FROM ONE TO ANOTHER ON EMPLOYEE AND ALSO IN THE HORSE RACING ISSUES OF PEOPLE WORKING ON THE TRACKS ARE THERE SECURITY LEVELS DIFFERENT THAN THOSE WORKING IN THE CARDS. IN THE CARD TO INDUSTRY. RIGHTS SO WORK PERMITS ARE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LEVEL THAN THE KEY EMPLOYEES KEY EMPLOYEES ARE THOSE WHO HAVE KIND DISCRETION IN SOME DECISION MAKING AUTHORITY IN THE CARD ROOM SO. HAVE A KIND OF A GREATER -- LICENSEE HURDLE I GUESS TO TO MEET SO YES WE DO CONSIDER THAT -- ALSO IN TERMS OF SECURITY THE BUREAU DOES GO IN AND CHECK ON SECURITY ISSUES IN THE COURTROOMS THEY DO COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS IF WE GET. A COMPLAINT ABOUT SOMETHING -- THE SECURITY IS A IN THE SURVEILLANCE IS A GREAT RESOURCE SO THEY UTILIZE THOSE -- TO CHECK ON THINGS WITH THE CARTER TO INTO THE CAM AND CAL IN SOME MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR BRADFORD BROUGHT UP -- YEAH I'M AND I SPECIFICALLY MENTION THE THIRTY SECOND SENATE DISTRICT -- IS NOW A AS AS WE HEARD THE SENATORS BEEN INVOLVED AS A CITY COUNCILMAN. FOR TWENTY SOME ODD YEARS AND SO ON AND IN THE QUESTION WHAT IS CHANGED -- BUT YOUR OFFICE I'M SOON AS I MENTIONED TO THE OTHER DIRECTOR SHOULD BE ACTED AS A THIRD NEUTRAL PARTY TO BRING THESE ISSUES TOGETHER. BRING UP TO LIGHT AND HAVE YOU ALSO THOUGHT OF BRINGING THE CITY MANAGER'S AND MARRIAGE TOGETHER SO YOU CAN FIND. THE THE AMOUNT OF INVOLVEMENT THAT THESE CARD CLUBS GIVE TO THE COMMUNITIES OF FROM SECURITY AND FIRE AND AND JUST OVERALL MAINTAINING THESE -- CITIES WITH THE INFLUX OF FOR HAVE YOU WAY THAT [inaudible] BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS IMPACT AND NOT JUST THE THREE OR FOUR COMPARED COMMUNITIES BUT ACROSS. OF THE THIRTY SECOND DISTRICT AND ALSO CENTER BRADFORD DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT THE LA COUNTY. YEAH SO SPECIFICALLY LIKE WITH THE ROTATION ISSUE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT LIKE MAYBE DOING -- PRE REGULATION WORKSHOPS JUST IN A COUPLE PLACES BUT WE DID SPREAD THEM OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE COULD GET INPUT FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HEAR HOW IT MIGHT IMPACT -- WE HAVE MET WITH INDIVIDUALS -- AND WE I CANNOT STRESS HOW HOW MUCH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPACTS SO WHEN OUR YOU GO TO OUR WORKSHOPS IT'S MOSTLY INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR THE CARD ROOMS. THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BENEFITTED FROM PROGRAMS -- AND THEN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE TAX REVENUE IT BRINGS SO WE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT -- WHEN WE DO DO REGULATIONS WE MOST LIKELY WILL HAVE TO DO A -- AM WHAT'S COMING KNOWS A SERENA AND STANDARDIZE REGULATORY -- IN THIS IMPACT ASSESSMENT TRYING TO REMEMBER THE ACRONYM -- BUT THAT'S RIPARIAN TO LOOK AT ALL THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT THE THE REGULATIONS WILL DO SO WHERE. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE TERM IMPACT ASSESSMENT YES GOTTA TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT WHAT THIS WOULD MEANTO THE TO THE ENTER SHE THE COMMUNITIES AND AND THE EMPLOYEES IN THE FAMILIES AND EVERYONE ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S WHY -- I I I LOOKTO TO MAKE SURE IT'S NEUTRAL IT'S A THIRD NEUTRAL PARTY YOU WEAR THAT HAT. TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND FIND THE COMMON GROUND THAT -- EVERYONE CAN BE HAPPY WITH AND MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS ON EACH EITHER SIDE. AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT THAT IS YOUR QUEST AND HOPEFULLY IT CAN HAPPEN. AND CENTER SO AGAIN WE ARE. FULLY AWARE OF THE IMPACT AND OPEN TO HEARING EVERYTHING THE THE MAIN THING THAT WAS SO WE NEED TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND I'VE LET FOLKS KNOW WHO HAVE. AND MAYBE NOT DO REGULATIONS ARE DRESSED MEANS AND I SAID YOU KNOW OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND THAT'S WE HAVE TO DO. SHOULDN'T DO AN EVACUATION LISTEN TO HOW THE IMPACT IS GONNA YOU KNOW AFFECT OTHERS BUT THAT'S KIND OF OUR OUR MAIN GOAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT MISTER CHAIR I WRITE I WILL ALSO STATE THAT OF THIS INFORMATIONAL CAM FOR A SESSION. MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO SOLVE AND AND GET THE COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED SO I'D LIKE TO BRING THIS UP IN THE FUTURE AND AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT AGAIN. THANK YOU YEAH I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- I THINK THE DIRECTOR WAS JUST BEING DIRECT WITH US INTO TELLING US WHAT'S GOING ON THE THE INTENT OF THIS WAS NOT TO GO. DID YOU KNOW TO HAVE AN OVERSIGHT HEARING A YOUON ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE BUT AS LONG AS WERE ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE. I THINK IT'S FAIR -- TO TO REALLY ZERO IN ON THE SIR BRADFORD POINT [inaudible] IF. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY LEE I'M I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT'S GOOD -- BUT MAYBE NOT. BUT I GUESS TO ME IF THIS KIND OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DOCTOR AND IS OR ANYTHING BUT IT DETRIMENTAL RELIANCE OR YOU KNOW WHAT WHATEVER THAT THE TERM IS. WHERE YOU'VE HAD CARD ROOMS A BEEN A BUSINESS THAT HAVE? BEEN RELYING ON CURRENT STATE CODE. OUR STATE LAW IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT IN THEIR BUSINESS AND WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THEY'VE HAD CITIES -- THAT HAVE BEEN DOING A SIMILAR THING -- I I FROM AN ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT THAT -- WHEN YOU'RE MAKING YOUR DECISION CAN TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT OR IS JUST THE COURTS? TOLD ME THERE'S A LAWSUIT THAT'S YOU KNOW IN THE CORD AND MORE I WONDER IF IT'S THE A WORTHY OF WAITING FOR THAT DECISION BEFORE. YOU KNOW ANYTHING'S DONE I I'M NOT SURE BUT I. E. I'M SURE YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. YEAH WE ARE WHERE THE LITIGATION AND HAVE FUN UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS OR WE CANNOT PROCEED FOR THE WE SHOULD PROCEED ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT I THINK BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE WE DON'T WANT. TO CAN TO KEEP PUSHING IT DOWN THE ROAD AND TRY. TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. YEAH UNDER STRUCK WITH TWO GERMAN STATES IS NOT A HEARING FOR DEEP DIVE BUT I WAS JUST CURIOUS PASSED. TO THE ROTATION SCHEME THAT YOU GUYS SAID. SUGGESTED AND HOW DO YOU THINK. A GAME OF SKILL IS ONE THAT REQUIRES CONTINUITY IN CONCENTRATION. AYE AT I WOULD PLAY A SLOT MACHINE IF I HAD TO GET UP EVERY TEN MINUTES SO WHY WULD SOMEONE PLAY A GAME OF SKILL. I MEAN BILLS PROPOSE REGULATIONS ALL BUT KILL THE GAME IN ITSELF THE SO ON THE ROTATION ISSUE WE ACTUALLY HAVEN'T DRAFTED ANYTHING YET WE WE HAVE THE WORKSHOPS JUST TO GET SOME INPUT. UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE'S EAGERLY WAITING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE THINKING -- YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE SOME LANGUAGE SOME OPTIONS HOPEFULLY SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW KIND OF DIG INTO IT BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY JUST TO OPEN THE ISSUE UP WE WANT TO HEAR FROM EVERYONE. SO IT'S IT'S BEEN GOOD IN THAT SENSE AND WHAT WE USUALLY DO WITH THE REGULATIONS FIRST SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTS LEGAL OPINIONS THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN OPEN UP TO THE PUBLIC WHERE WE HEAR A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW THE ISSUES FROM THE FROM LIKE THE EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT. LIKE TO JUST REVISIT A MOMENT WE'VE TALKED. ABOUT. THE BACKLOG ISSUE NOW THAT'S ENDEMIC IN MANY AGENCIES IN SOME MUCH OF HUGE PROBLEM. AT EACH YEAR AGENCIES COMMON THEIR ONLY ANSWER IS MORE P. WEISS. AND THEN THE BACKLOG CONTINUES. ARE YOUR THE MIND AT THE END AND FORCING ACTIONS AND IN THE GAME GAMING INDUSTRY THAT -- THEN OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE OR IS IT JUST IS A BEEN MORE LIP SERVICE AND MORE PEOPLE EYES AND WE JUST CONTINUE. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME FROM MY ROLE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT IT'S BEEN AS BIG A PROBLEM IN THIS INDUSTRY BUT WHAT'S YOUR TECH. BALD SO THESE OF THE THIRD U. POSITIONS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT SO IT'S NINETY IS NOT AN INCREASE IT'S JUST KEEPING THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE HER DOING THE WORK SO -- AGAIN THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE THE INCREASE A DECREASE IN THE BACKLOG BUT WE WANT TO KEEP.

I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CAN KEEP IN MIND THAT THE COMBINED EDUCATION BUDGETS REPRESENTS MORE THAN 40% OF THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET ACTUALLY REIMBURSEMENTS THE FEDERAL FUNDS. THE LOTTERY ACT REQUIRED STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL POST. A POST AUDIT OF ALL ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS OF LOTTERY. AND OTHER SPECIAL POSADAS AS A CONTROLLER DEEMS NECESSARY RESULTS ARE POSTED ON CONTROLS WEBSITE. THE LOTTERY ACT AS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED REQUIRED LOTTERY SALES TO BE DISTRIBUTED WITH 50% GOING TO PRICES. MINIMALLY 34% GOING TO PUBLIC EDUCATION AND A MAXIMUM 60%FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. IN TWO THOUSAND TEN SIMPLY BILL ONE FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HIGH YEAH SHE AMENDED THE LOTTERY ACT TO PROVIDE A LOT OF WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY. BY ALLOWING IT TO PAY OUT MORE MONEY AND LOTTERY PRIZES. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY REQUIRING THAT 87% OF LOTTERY SALES BE ALLOCATED TO PRIZES IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND REDUCING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FROM SIXTY PER SCENT OF TOTAL SALES. AB ONE FORTY TO PASS ON THE PREMISE THAT INCREASING AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO PRICES WOULD INCREASE SALES. WHICH IN TURN WOULD INCREASE THE TOTAL NET REVENUES AVAILABLE TO LOTTERY BENEFICIARIES. THE STATUTE ALSO REQUIRED STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO ANNUALLY DETERMINE. FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AFTER ENACTMENT WHETHER CERTAIN POSITIVE FISCAL CONDITIONS OCCURRED AT THE END OF THE FIRST FIVE FISCAL YEARS. AB ONE FORTY TWO REQUIRE THE STATE CONTROLS TO CONVENE A LOTTERY REVIEW GROUP CONSISTING OF THE CONTROLLER. SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE LOTTERY COMMISSION. TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. ON WHETHER THE AMENDMENTS MADE BY AB ONE FORTY TWO FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE LOTTERY ACT IS INTENDED. THE STATE CONTROLLER'S MEDI TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE MARCH TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH CONFIRMED AB. ONE FORTY TWO WORKED AS INTENDED. I BELIEVE THERE WAS A CHART THERE'S HANDED OUT SAID OKAY -- SO THE CHART. A REFLECT ANY CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR THE EIGHT YEARSPRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF AB. ONE FORTY TOO MANY YEARS POST IMPLEMENTATION OF AB. ONE FORTY TWO I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT THE RESULTS BEEN POSITIVE AB. ONE FORTY TWO POSSIBLY THE LAST THREE YEARS THE CHART REFLECTED PORTENTS OF STABLE LEADERSHIP LOTTERY. LOTTERIES ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WHICH ARE STATURE IT pTESTED SHORT CAPPED AT 13% OF TOTAL ANNUAL SALES. APPEAR HIGH ANTI REALIZE IT MOSTLY MINISTRY TO EXPENSES. ARE FIXED COSTS. AND THAT MAYOR LOTTERY SALES AND A TRIPLE ATTRIBUTABLE TO REACH OTHER COMPENSATION COST AND GAMING RELATED COST. SO BREAKING DOWN THE 13% ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. ROUGHLY 7% IS A RETAILER COMPENSATION. THIS IS THE AMOUNT IS PAID A LOTTERY RETAILER BUSINESSES IN THE STATE FOR SELLING Là PRODUCTS. AND CASH PRIZES UNDER FIVE HUNDRED NINETY NINE DOLLARS. RETAILERS RECEIVE 6% OF THE LOTTERY SALES. FOR HAVE PERCENT FOR SELF SERVICE TERMINALS AND CASH BONUSES OF 3% AND 1% FOR DRUG AND TO SCRATCH AGAIN RESPECTIVELY. ALSO INCLUDES VARIOUS RETAILERS CENTERS COST STRICTLY CORRELATE WITH LOTTERY SALES. AND WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION LAST FISCAL YEAR. PROXY 2% IS FOR GAMING RELATED COSTS. THIS REPRESENTS THE COST TO PURCHASE AND DISTRIBUTE LOTTERY SCRATCHER TICKETS. TO PROXY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND LOTTERY RETAILERS. THAT ALSO INCLUDES CONTRACT COST FOR LOTTERY GAMING SYSTEM PROVIDER INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY -- IGT. GAMING RELATED COSTS ALSO DIRECTLY CORRELATE WITH LOTTERY SALES. AND WE'RE NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION LAST FISCAL YEAR. THE REMAINING 4% OFFER SALARIES NUMBER EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT. THESE ARE YOUR TYPICAL OVERHEAD EXPENSES UP ON THINKS ABOUT LATER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. LOTTERY TYPICALLY SPENDS JUST OVER 3% OF ANNUAL SALES REVENUE FOR OPERATING EXPENSES. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED ANY SAVINGS FOR MINISTRY EXPENSES. ARTS EXTRA REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED TO PUBLIC EDUCATION. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS LETTER HAS SENT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. MORE TO PUBLIC EDUCATION BY MAINTAINING ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES BELOW THE 30% CAP. A SIGNIFICANT CHIP WHICH THE STATEMENTS ARE THE RESULT OF A RECENT CONTRACT EXTENSION THAT WAS NEGOTIATED LAST FISCAL YEAR WITH OUR GAME INVENTOR IGT. RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE WITH IGT WE CONSULTED WITH THECALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY REGARDING THE TIME AND EFFORT ASSOCIATE WITH ISSUED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR NARESH P.. FOR CONTRACTED AS MANY STUDENTS AND COMPLEXITY. WELLS CONSULTED WITH OTHER STATE LOTTERIES AND UNDERGONE VENDOR AND GAMING SYSTEM CONVERSIONS. TRUST IN THE FISCAL PROGRAMMATIC IMPACT. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION WE OPTED AND RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT. WITH THE OPTION ISSUE AN RFP IF NEGOTIATES DID NOT PROGRESS IS DESIRED. CONSEQUENTLY MYSELF SMALL GROUP OF KHILLARI EXECUTIVES. SPENT AN ENORMOUS TIME WORKING WITH URBAN IN A CONTRACT EXTENSION. THE END RESULT WAS A SEVEN YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION THAT RESULTED IN ESTIMATED SAVINGS OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. OR PROXY FORTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION ANNUALLY. WHEN COMPARED TO THE EXISTING CONTRACT? THE LOTTERY ALSO RECEIVED A NEW GAMING SYSTEM. WHICH WERE THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING. AND IN LARGE AND NEW LOTTERY EQUIPMENT FOR MOST A LOT OF TWENTY THOUSAND RETAILERS. INSTALLATION THE REQUIREMENT IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED BY JUNE THIS YEAR. PRIMARY FACTORS THE RESULT IN THE SAVINGS INCLUDE A 50% BASED COMPENSATION RATE REDUCTION. WHEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT WAS NEGOTIATED THE IMPACT OF AB FORTY ONE FORTY TWO WAS UNKNOWN? ADDITION THE CONTEXT ENGINE REFLECTS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT. FROM LOTTERY PURCHASING LOTTERY EQUIPMENT FOR RETAILERS THE LOTTERY LEASING Là EQUIPMENT. THIS ELIMINATES EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE COSTS WHILE INSURANCE LOTTERY HAS ACCESS TO THE NEWS DEPARTMENT. BECAUSE LARA NEGOTIATE THE CONTEXT SENTIENT TWO YEARS WITH TWO YEARS REMAINING ON THE EXISTING CONTRACT. BLOTTER BEGAN REALIZING THAT FORTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION IN ANNUAL SAVINGS TWO YEARS EARLIER. WHICH ARE PASSED ON TO LOTTERY BENEFICIARIES OR PUBLIC EDUCATION. CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY IS A SECOND WATERS LARGEST LOTTERY IN THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF SALES. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY AT THE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING LOTTERIES IN THE NATION. SALES GROWTH OF INFORMATICS REVENUE INCREASES THE SCRATCHERS HOWEVER WE ARE SEEN -- GAINES WITHDRAWAL GAMES TO THE LARGER MEGA MILLIONS AND POWERBALL JACKPOTS. IT'S ALSO PORTER MEMBER THAT MORE THAN NINETY FIVE CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT A LOTTERY. GOES BACK INTO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN THE FORM OF PRICES RETAILER COMPENSATION SUPPLEMENT OF FUNDED PUBLIC EDUCATION STAFF SALARIES. THIS YEAR LARGE PROJECTS TO EXCEED ITS SEVEN POINT ZERO NINE BILLION DOLLARS SALES GOAL. HAVING SAID THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. PLOTTERS THREE YEAR BUSINESS PLAN HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO SHOULD THE LOTTERY FOCUSES ON ITS PRIMARY MISSION. WHICH IS THE BOTTOM LINE FOR LOTTERY PROP MY LOTTERY SALES. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED FOR MAKE A STRATEGIC CHANGES TO A LOT OF PRODUCT LINE. ENSURING THE LOTTERY HAS CORRECT PRODUCT MIX TO GENERATE PROFITS. GENERALLY LARGE CELLS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED FAIRLY EASY. HOWEVER GENERALIZED PROFITS. REQUIRES CAREFUL IT'S PROJECT PLANNING. THIS RELATES THE PRIZE PAYOUT FRIDGE LOTTERY GAMES FOR EXAMPLE. IT TAKES FOURTEEN POINT THREE MILLION AND THIRTY DOLLARS SCRATCH TICKETS TO GENERATE ONE MILLION AND LOTTERY PROFITS. WHILE IT TAKES THREE POINT THREE MILLION IN ONE DOLLAR SCRATCH TICKET SALES TO GENERATE ONE MILLION LOTTERY PROFITS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE THIRTY DOLLAR TICKET HAS 80% PRIZE PAYOUT WHILE THE ONE DOLLAR TO GET HAS A 57% PRICE PATH. DRUG GAINES HAVE A 50% PRICE BETH. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES TO SELF ASSESS AND EXPLORE METHODS OF IMPROVING ITS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE GIVEN THAT WE ARE COMPETING FOR DISPOSAL INCOME. CONSUMERS HAVE MANY CHOICES. ONE SUCH EFFORT IS THE LOTTERIES PAID THE DISTRICT OFFICE BY THE PROGRAM. WHICH STARTED IN NOVEMBER. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PROVIDES LOTTERY CHECKS FOR PRICE OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS. TO LOTTERY WINNERS WHO COMMITTED SACRAMENTO DISTRICT OFFICE. CHECKS ARE PROCESSED AND ISSUED. TYPICALLY WITHIN TEN MINUTES. THESE ARE PRICE CHECKS ARE LIMITED INDIVIDUALS WHO BRING IN CLAIMS WITHOUT ERRORS OR GOVERNMENT OFFSETS. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE PRICES BETWEEN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA WENT THROUGH LARGE CLAIM PROCESS. WHICH REQUIRES MILLION WINNING TICKET AND CLAIM FORM TO LOTTERY HEADQUARTERS WHICH ACQUIRES AT PROCESSING THE CLAIM. FOR YOU TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND ISSUE IN THE STATE WARRANT. AT TIMES OF PEAK SALES IN. HI JACKPOTS THIS PROCESS HAPPEN TO OFTEN TOOK FORTY WEEKS FOR PRICE WHICH RECEIVED A CHECK. THE TO DATE THE LOTTERY HAS ISSUED MORE THAN A THOUSAND CHECKS. AND DEPOSIT PROGRAM AND CLEAR FEEDBACK IS BEEN OVER. THE LOTTERY HAS RECEIVED HONORS FROM THE WORLD LOTTERY ASSOCIATION -- W. LA. A GLOBAL GLOBAL LOTTERY INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO RECEIVE THE HIGHEST AWARD. FOR TO SPONSOR GAINING PROGRAM THE DEBBIE LA LEVEL FOR RESPONSIBLE GAMING AWARD IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY. DEMONSTRATES LARGE COMMITMENT TO GROWING AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. CALIFORNIA'S TELLS THE RECIPIENT OF THE W. LAYS SECURITY CONTROL STANDARDS CERTIFICATION. THE CERTIFICATIONS LARGE INDUSTRIES ONLY INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED SECURITY STANDARDS. LARA HAS FOUR EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY FIVE PERMANENT POSITIONS FOR NINETY FIVE ARC HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. IN SACRAMENTO THREE AN FIFTY REPORT TO OUR NINE DISTRICT OFFICES OR TWO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. LARA'S ALSO LEADER IN MEETING STATEMENT THE BUILDING AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. THE DATE FOR ALL NEW LIVE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AS LEAD CERTIFIED AND ZERO NET ENERGY. GENERATE MUCH ENERGY IS THE CONSUMER A YEAR. LARA'S FLEET INCLUDES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND CHARGING STATIONS ARE AVAILABLE AT FIVE WATER BUILDINGS. WITH MORE TO COME. THANK INCLUDES MY REMARKS YOU MIGHT HAVE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU -- CENTER OUR AND WHAT THE AS OF TWENTY SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO SEE -- THE INCREASE IN AND EDUCATION FUNDING SENSE OF THE PAST ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ON THE LOTTERY CONTINUES TO HAVE IN THE PUBLIC RELATIONS ARENA -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL HAD WHICH IS THAT -- IT MAYBE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF OVER PROMISING -- YOU KNOW WHEN I GO OUT THERE AND TALK ABOUT THE EDUCATION -- IN FRANCE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATION EVER NOT. INEVITABLY THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE IS WHAT THAT THE WATER IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THAT. AND NOW IT'S GREAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S BASICALLY JUST 1% OF OUR OF OUR EDUCATION BUDGET -- WHY IS IT THAT THERE IS SUCH YOU KNOW WHAT THE? CAN YOU CAN USE THE KEY TALK A BIT ABOUT THE PASSAGE OF THE IN THE IMPLEMENTATION THE LOTTERY BACK IN THE DAY. AND THE PROMISES THAT WERE MADE ABOUT EDUCATION FUNDING -- YOU KNOW ONE THING I CONCERT SAID PEOPLE'S IT HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY RUN A FUNCTION WATERY -- THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IN THE IN THE THERE ACTUALLY FULLY FIND THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM BUT I THINK IN PEOPLE'S MINDS -- THEY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T KIND. THE SCOPE AND SIZE OF THESE SYSTEMS AT PLAY HERE AND YOU KNOW THAT STORY WAS I THINK TOLD VERY. LESLIE TO THE PUBLIC WHEN THEY WERE BEING SOLD ON THE IDEA OF OPENING THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE. I KNOW I I I ACTUALLY WORKED AT DATE. REACH AYE STORK ALBERTSON'S WHEN THE WATER IS PASS ARE I WAS THE CLERK I REMEMBER THE WHOLE THING WITH THE EXCITEMENT WITH THE LOTTERY -- AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY CORRECT -- IF THEY I I STILL HEAR THAT THAT SAME THING NOW AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHY IS THE LOTTERY NOT FUNDING EDUCATION AND THEIR STATE. A PERCEPTION THAT THE LATTER WAS WAS GOING TO FIND JUST A LOT OF EDUCATION'S BUDGET -- AND THAT SEXY YOU KNOW WHEN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE TRYING -- TO PUT IN THERE IS THAT A STEP THAT I CITED THE TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN DOLLARS -- BECAUSE WHEN WE TALKED TO INDIVIDUALS WE CAN TELL THEM ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS GOES TO PUBLIC EDUCATION -- BUT I THINK WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR MUCH COMES TO TO MY CLASS -- SO HOPEFULLY THE TO AN ELEVEN DOLLARS MAKES IT MORE TANGIBLE FRUGAL TO UNDERSTAND. THAT A LOT OF YOU SEARCHLIGHT TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS -- BUT IT'S NOT THE BE ALL FIX ALL THAT -- PERHAPS PEOPLE MAY. HUNDRED ELEVEN TO EACH CLASSROOM EVERY YEAR JUNE. ELEVEN THE NETS THE EIGHTH AND IT IT'S NOT PROVIDED THAT'S JUST THE AVERAGE. THAT IS TAKING THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT THE ONE POINT SEVEN DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE RIGHT SO AS IS INDICATED MY TESTIFIED HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT IS IS IS IS ABOUT FIFTY PER CUSTOMER PER STUDENT. THAT'S FOR STUDENTS PERSON. AGAIN THAT DOESN'T GO FOR INDIVIDUAL STUDENT THAT'S JUST I NEVER UNDERSTAND RIGHT OKAY YEAH YEAH. YEAH -- OKAY I MEAN I OBVIOUSLY YOU WEREN'T RIGHT IN THE THAT SHOW AT THE TIME -- BUT I DO THINK IN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES IS THAT WHEN. PROGRAMS ARE ARE OVERSOLD. CAM PRODUCES DISAPPOINTMENT EVEN IF THERE'S GOOD RESULTS BE PRODUCE AND I THINK THAT AND I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL TO BE HONEST I MEAN YOU KNOW. HOW THAT THAT CAN THE SENATE ON A ON A DANGEROUS COURSE MOVING? FOR IT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND AND YOU KNOW WE WE TRY TO FOCUS AND WE WORK -- WITH OUR EDUCATION PARTNERS TO TO FOCUS ON THE GOOD THE GOOD STORIES TO ME TO THIS DAY I STILL GET A QUESTION ABOUT THE LOTTERY WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT SCHOOL FINANCE AND IT'S THE I DON'T HOW MANY YEARS LATER I MEAN TWENTY YEARS LATER -- THIRTY THIRTY FIVE OKAY AREA THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE THERE IS THAT WHAT THEY TOLD US IT WAS GOING TO THE US SOLVE OUR EDUCATION FINANCE PROBLEMS AND IT'S PROVIDING 1% WHICH IS IMPORTANT BUT ONLY. 1%. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY MISS LOPEZ THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PER SHIFT. OKAY -- WE'RE GONNA HAVE NOW REPEAT OCCUR AT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD [inaudible] DID YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DRESS YOU THIS MORNING -- AS ONCE A SINCE ITS OPENING DAY OF GEO I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT WEAR A NICE HAT -- FOR THIS PRESENTATION BUT TO ENOUGH AREA IN LIKE A CAP GIVE AWAY TO HAVE LIKE A LIKE A NICE A HORSE RACING HAT FOR OPENING DAY BROUGHT A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL MAYBE. A FASCINATING I'LL REMEMBER THAT NEXT YEAR THANK -- AS WAS STATED BEFORE THE HORSE RACING BOARD WAS AUTHORIZED BY STATEWIDE REFERENDUM IN -- NINETEEN THIRTY THREE SO LAST YEAR WE TURNED -- EIGHTY THE CREATION OF THE BOARD BY THE LEGISLATURE THE THE THEN RATIFIED BY THE PEOPLE'S SAID THE BOARD SHALL HAVE ALL POWERS NECESSARY AND PROPER. FOR ADOPTING RULES AND REGULATIONS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. FOR ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF ALL LOU -- LAWS RULES AND RAGS. ADJUDICATION OF CONTROVERSIES LICENSING OF EACH RACING ASSOCIATION AND ALL PERSONS OTHER THAN THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. WHO PARTICIPATED A HORSE RACING EETING WITH PARIMUTUEL WAGERING? AND THE ALLOCATION OF RACING DATES TO QUALIFIED ASSOCIATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW. OF THE SEA HRB IS SPECIAL FUNDED WE HAVE A STAFF OF ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS. THAT INCLUDES TWENTY TWO STEWARDS AND SAFETY STERN WORDS TWELVE OFFICIAL VETERINARIANS AND THIRTEEN SWORN POLICE OFFICERS -- THE STEWARDS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE BOARD'S MISSION TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY VIABILITY AND SAFETY OF THE HORSE RACING INDUSTRY. THROUGH MOST OF THE CALENDAR YEAR THERE ARE FOUR LICENSED RACING MEETS AN OPERATION -- TO IN THE SOUTH AND TWO IN THE NORTH FOR INSTANCE THIS WEEK WE WILL HAVE. DAYTIME RACING AT SANTA ANITA. IN ARCADIA GOLDEN GATE FIELDS ON THE NIGHT TIME RACING WILL BE AT A LOSS ALAMEDA WAS DOWN SOUTH AND AT CAL EXPO UP HERE IN THE NORTH. DURING THE SUMMER MIXED BREED RACING IS CONDUCTED AT THE FAIRS AT SEVEN FAIRGROUNDS SHINS UP-HERE IN THE NORTH IN THOROUGHBRED RACING IN THE SOUTH SHIPS TO DEL MAR. THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND LICENSEES AUTHORIZED PARTICIPATE IN RACING IN CALIFORNIA. AND SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE BOARD. AS AUTHORIZED BY LAW RACING IS SELF ADJUDICATING. A PANEL OF THREE BOARD CONTRACTED STEWARDS ARE JUDGES ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH RACE TRACK. AND PER LAW THESE JUDGES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RACE MEET IN EVERY PARTICULAR. THEY SERVE AS REFEREES DURING THE RACING PROGRAM AND HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THE ORDER OF FINISH. IF A FILE HAS OCCURRED COSTING HORSE A BETTER PLACING. BUT THE STORES ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO FINE AND SUSPEND THEY CONDUCT HEARINGS AND A RULE VIOLATIONS WHICH MAY INCLUDE MEDICATION VIOLATIONS. THE C. HRB HAS THE MOST ROBUST DRUG TESTING PROTOCOLS IN THE COUNTRY. WHILE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DRUGS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR USE IN HORSES. ONLY A FEW ANTI INFLAMMATORY OR THERAPEUTIC MEDICINES ARE PERMITTED IN RACING. AND THE PERMITTED THRESHOLDS FOR THOSE IS LESS THAN A GRAIN OF SALT PER MILLILITER OF BLOOD. AND IF THEY AREN'T STRICTLY PRINT PERMITTED THEY ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED. THE BOARD UTILIZES THE MEDI LAB AT UC DAVIS FOR ITS TESTING THE LAB IS NOT ONLY ACCREDITED IN THE U. S.. BUT ONE OF FIVE ACCREDITED INTERNATIONALLY. LAST FISCAL YEAR THE MEDI LAB ANALYZE THOUSAND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE SAMPLES. FOR THE WORST RACING BOARD BY WAY OF COMPARISON YOU SADA ON THE U. S. ANTI DOPING AGENCY. TESTED ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND SAMPLES DURING THAT SAME TIME FRAME. THE MAJORITY OF OUR TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON BLOOD AND URINE FOLLOWING THE RACE -- BUT WE ALSOCONDUCT PRE RACE TESTING. OUT OF COMPETITION TESTING SOME OF THAT TESTING MIGHT INCLUDE HAIR FOLLICLE TESTING. WE HAVE FOUR CATEGORIES OF MEDICATION VIOLATIONS AND RACING. THREE OF THEM ARE WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE ARE FELONIES THOSE ARE MEDICATIONS THAT MAY ENHANCE PERFORMANCE. FOR THE FOURTH ARE USUALLY ACCIDENTAL OVERAGES OF PERMITTED MEDICATIONS LIKE ANTI INFLAMMATORIES. SO OF THE FIFTY SIX THOUSAND SAMPLES TESTED LAST YEAR WE HAD SIX OF THOSE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. MY PERSONAL VIEW THAT HORSE RACING AS ARGUABLY THE CLEANEST. OF ALL THE MAJOR SPORTS. BUT STILL LIVES WITH THE STIGMAS AND STEREOTYPES THAT THERE'S MANIPULATION GOING ON BECAUSE THERE'S BETTING. THE BOARD IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY OF THE WAGERING IN PARA MUTUAL WAY DURING THE RACE TRACK HAS NO INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE WAGER. IT ACTS AS A KIND OF ESCROW COMPANY ACCEPTING THE WAITERS AND PAYING THE WINNERS. DURING THE LAST FISCAL YEAR WAY DURING BY CALIFORNIANS -- ON CALIFORNIA RACES OR BY PEOPLE OUT OF STATE ON CALIFORNIA RACES TOTAL THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THE TAKE OUT WITH HELP FROM THESE WAGERS IS DISTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO STATUTE AND ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF WAGER. WHERE WAS PLACED AND THE TIME OF DAY IT WAS PLACED WE ARE AT THE RECONCILIATION OF THESE DISTRIBUTIONS? THIS FEATURE BE ALSO LICENSES SEVEN ONLINE PROVIDERS. THAT'S ACCOUNT WAGERING. BETTING ON HORSE RACING IS THE ONLY LEGAL FORM OF ONLINE WAGERING -- IN CALIFORNIA. THIS TYPE OF WAGERING NOW COMPRISES ABOUT 2121% OF THE TOTAL HANDLE. I KNOW LIKE TO ADDRESS ARE RACING SAFETY PROGRAM. OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A RACE HORSE IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO. THERE'S GREAT SENSITIVITY TO THE CARE AND WELFARE OF THE HORSE. THE HORSE RACING BOARD THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN WINNER AND THAT AND AND THE COMMISSIONERS AND OUR EQUINE MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO BY THE WAY IS AN EMPLOYEE PER STATUTE AS AN EMPLOYEE OF UC DAVIS NOT OF THE HORSE RACING BOARD. WE DEVELOP A NEW RACING -- PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE DETERMINE OUR HORSES AT RISK. THESE INCLUDE HORSES THAT HAVE NOT STARTED IN A RACE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OR MORE. WHO ARE FOUR YEARS OLD OR OLDER AND ARE ON RACED MUST BE A REASON WHY THEY HAVEN'T RACE TO THAT POINT? WHO HAVE EVER BEEN PLACE ON THE VETS LIST THE VETS LIST IS -- ONE OF OUR RULES THAT ALLOWS OUR VETERINARIANS -- FOR ANY REASON BUT USUALLY FOR ON SOUND A SOURCE SICKNESS -- TO BE PLACED ON A BEST LIST WHICH ME ON CANNOT COMPETE IN A RACE UNTIL THEY HAVE -- PERFORMED IN A WORK OUT AND HAD A POST RACE TESTS DONE -- AND ARE APPROVED BY THE VETERINARIAN TO RETURN TO RACING -- THAT'S A LOT OF HORSES ACTUALLY THAT ARE IDENTIFIED EVERY DAY -- AND THOSE HORSES ARE SUBMITTED TO ENHANCED EXAMINATIONS ORDINARILY A WORSE THIS GONNA RUN IN A RACE. IS SEEN BY OUR OFFICIAL VETERINARIAN ON THE MORNING OF THE RACE EVERY HORSE THAT RACES IS EXAMINED. BUT THESE HORSES ARE EXAMINED MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THEY'RE ALLOWED. TO ENTER TO RUN. THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME BENEFITS TO THIS PROGRAM WHICH FRANKLY WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE. THIS SCRUTINY HAS CAUSED THE PEOPLE THAT CARE FOR THESE HORSES TO BE AMERICAN MORE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY MAY HAVE AN ISSUE -- SO THAT IS HELPFUL ALSO THE VETERINARIANS THAT SEE THESE SOURCES WHETHER IT'S IN THE BARN. OWL OR WHEN THEY'RE TAKING OVER TO THE RECEIVING BARN BEFORE THE RACE WHEN THEY GO INTO THE SADDLING PADDOCK BEFORE THE RACE AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE OUT ON THE RACETRACK. THE VETERINARIANS THAT ARE THERE THE OFFICIAL OR TRACK VETERINARIANS REALIZE THAT THESE HORSES -- DESERVE A SECOND LOOK. AS A RESULT WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT. IMPROVEMENTS -- IN. THE SAFETY OF HORSES WE HAVE A A RULE THAT SAYS THAT ANY WORSE THAT DIES WITHIN AN ENCLOSURE OF A C. H. R. B. FACILITY. MUST BE NECROPSY BY UC DAVIS. THAT PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN -- NINETEEN NINETY LAST YEAR WE HAD THE FEWEST NUMBER OF NEW CROP SEES IN TWENTY NINE YEARS. SO. MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT A SINGLE HORSE LOST. IS TOO MANY. BUT I WANT TO ASSURE THIS COMMITTEE THAT THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. FOR THE HORSE RACING BOARD NOT TOP NOT TROLL -- BUT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. WE HAVE OTHER SAFETY ISSUES THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION TO YOU WE ARE THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION. THAT RESTRICTS THE USE OF THE RIDING CROP DURING A RACE -- IF IT THE JOCKEY A USE OF THE RIDING CROP MORE THAN THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION WITHOUT GIVING A WORSE A CHANCE TO RESPOND. BATS A VIOLATION OF OUR RULES IF THE JOCKEY -- VIOLATES THAT RULE MORE THAN ONCE THEN THE PENALTY IS INCREASED. AND THAT CAN RESULT IN ALWAYS RESULTS IN FINES AND CAN RESULT IN SUSPENSIONS AS WELL. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS RULE ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO? THE WRITING HAS GOTTEN MORE PROFESSIONAL IN CALIFORNIA. THE USE OF THE RIDING CROP HAD BECOME KIND OF A CRUNCH FOR JOCKEYS. NOW THERE ARE USING THE HANDS MORE OFTEN THEY'RE THEY'RE MORE PROFESSIONAL RIDERS WE HAVE THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY TO BEGIN WITH HERE GENERALLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS MADE THEM EVEN BETTER -- WE REPORT ALMOST. IT'S VERY RARE THAT WE SEE AN INJURY TO A HORSE BECAUSE OF THE USE OF THE CROP THE CROP ITSELF HAS BEEN CHANGED IT SHORTER. I'D USED TO BE USED TO HAVE A LIKE A VINYL AND ON IT -- AND NOW THAT THE END ON IT IS -- MADE OF MICROPHONE OR WHATEVER THEY CALL THAT -- SO IT'S VERY SOFT VERY FORGIVING AND SO WE THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THERE AND ALSO I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS A SAFETY STORED PROGRAM. THIS THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED BY MY PREDECESSOR KIRK BREED ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. AND WHEREAS THE STORES THAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE ARE THE JUDGES AND THEY BASICALLY ARE MONITORING EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THESE TWO WORDS WORK ON THEIR BEHALF TO BE IN THE STABLE AREA ON THE RACE TRACK AT ALL TIMES MONITORING SAFETY. FROM SIMPLE THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THAT ANYBODY ON HORSEBACK AS A SAFETY VEST THE RIGHT TYPE OF HELMET MAKING SURE THE RIDING CROPS -- COMPLY WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THERE IN THE STABLE AREA THEY HAVE BECOME -- THE EYES AND EARS EXTENDED EYES AND EARS FOR OUR INVESTIGATORS AND ANYTHING THAT THEY SEE THAT THEY REALIZE THE POTENTIAL VIOLATION -- THEY SECURE THE LOCATION AND THEY CALL ONE OF OUR INVESTIGATORS. WE'RE ALSO VERY. LUCKY TO HAVE. COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. WHO HAVE A CARE FOR THE RACE HORSE? WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT CARE WHO ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE PUBLIC IN THE RIGHT THING FOR THE INDUSTRY -- AND YOU KNOW IT OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT MORE BY SOME AS A A LEGAL OFFICE -- HELL WARD OTHERS MAY BE AS SOME KIND OF MARKETING PARTNER. A REMAND I REMIND EVERYBODY WE'RE NOT THAT -- WE'RE REGULATORS WHO ENFORCE THE LAW WHEN FORCE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE STATE. AND WE DO HAVE THIS SPECTACULAR CREATURE THIS BEAUTIFUL REYES SOURCE -- AS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AND SO WHAT IT TO KEEP SUCH PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. THANK YOU IT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THE CENTER OUR PERHAPS -- IT'S MORE TIRED THE HELL NO NO THIS IS A MORE SERIOUS. QUESTION YOU KNOW -- I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TERM SAFETY I WILL SAY IN TODAY'S MY LA TIMES THIS MORNING OPEN IT UP. AND THERE'S AN ARTICLE ABOUT HOW -- SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH DAY -- SANITY TO RACE TRACK JUST SUFFERED ITS NINETEENTH HORSE DESK NINETEEN WORK RESOURCES HAVE DIED AT SANTA ANITA. SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTH. ALONE SO WE'RE LOSING A HORSE. A BEAUTIFUL RESOURCE EVERY TWO OR THREE DAYS WITHOUT A TYPO OR WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON IT'S IN INDIA. WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN. ASKING AND TRYING TO ANSWER OVER THE LAST MANY WEEKS -- THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WHEN THERE'S HEAVY RAINS IN THE TRACK IS MANIPULATED. IT IS WHAT THEY CALL SEALED IN ANTICIPATION OF A RACE -- I'M SORRY OF A RAINSTORM. A MINUTE AFTER THE RAIN STORM IT IS OPEN BACK UP AGAIN. AND WHEN WE HAVE THE DROUGHT YEARS. WE HAD A WONDERFUL SAFETY NUMBERS. BUT NOW WITH THESE CHANGING RACETRACKS SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRACKS IN THE COURSE OF A WEEK. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE WEATHER'S DOING WHAT THE MAINTENANCE IS -- IT PUTS SUSCEPTIBLE HORSES AT RISK. IT IS AN INEXACT SCIENCE. A SANTA NEED AS WE SPEAK HAS THE THE PERSON IS -- BELIEVE TO BE THE FOREMOST AUTHORITY ON THESE SERVICES AT SANITY'S OF THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY'S AT SANTA ANITA. UM NOW AS A RESULT OF THE BOARD'S INTERVENTION OVER THE WEEKEND LET ME STIPULATE THAT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATING FOR THE BOARD. BECAUSE WE HAVE SPECIFIC RULES AND REGULATIONS THOSE ARE EASY TO ENFORCE. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE RACE TRACK LIES WITH THE ASSOCIATION. HOW THEY DO COME BEFORE THE BOARD MULTIPLE TIMES PER YEAR AND THEY HAVE TO PRESENT THEIR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND THEY HAVE TO SHOW AS INDIVIDUALS OR QUALIFIED TO TAKE CARE OF THE RACETRACK AND SO FORTH? BUT THE ONLY ACTION THAT THE BOARD CAN REALLY TAKE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS IS TO SHUT IT DOWN. AND I GOTTA TELL YA THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT THAT. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE. THIS THIS NUMBER THIS. NINETEEN IS MORE THAN DOUBLE. THE NUMBER LAST YEAR AT THE SAME TIME. I WILL SAY TO YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THAT. LAST YEAR THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND STARTERS IN RACES. WORK OUTS EACH DAY THERE WILL BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY HORSES THAT ARE IN A TIME. WORKOUT OTHER WORDS A FULL OUT EXERCISE EACH MORNING AS WELL AS THE HUNDRED THAT WILL RACE IN THE AFTERNOON. THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT QUESTION. FOR THE BOARD TO ANSWER [inaudible] BECAUSE WHEN YOU. STOP RACING WHEN YOU SHUT IT DOWN -- YOU'RE ALSO TAKING PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS AWAY FROM THEM AND SO FORTH. SO I WISH I HAD A GOOD ANSWER FOR YOU SENATOR I DON'T. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WE ADD ON SUNDAY MORNING WE WERE ON THE PHONE -- WITH SANITY TO MANAGEMENT WE CONVINCE THEM TO SHUT DOWN THE RACETRACK ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. AND WHICH THEY'VE DONE. AND THEY THE UNFORTUNATELY THAT AND SHUT THE TRACK DOWN TILL NINE O'CLOCK ON MONDAY MORNING AND WILD HORSE WAS LOST -- SO THEY GOT THE TRACK CLOSE TO HAVE TAKING IT ALL APART THEY REALLY BROUGHT OUT MISTER MAKE PETERSON DR MAKE PETERSON AND WILL EVALUATE IT GOING FORWARD BUT AGAIN. THE ONLY ACTION REALLY THAT THE BOARD CAN TAKE OTHER THEN URGING CAJOLING AND PUSHING -- IS TO SHUT THE INDUSTRY DOWN TO SUSPEND. THE THE LICENSE OF THE RACING ASSOCIATION. THROUGH TYPICALLY AT JUST SO I UNERSTAND A HORSE. WITH THE WET CONDITIONS A HORSE LOSES ITS FOOTING THE BRICKELL BREAK A LEG AND HAVE TO BE PUT DOWN AS THAT IS ACTIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. YOU ESSENTIALLY YEAH IT'S IT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A CONSISTENT RACING SERVICE THAT'S EVERYBODY'S GOAL -- SAW WELL. IF YOU IF THE IF. IF IT WAS JUST UP TO THE TRACK MAINTENANCE CREW -- YOU KNOW THEY'VE THEY'VE THEY WATER THE TRACK ALMOST. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THEY THEY HAVE THESE THE UP MONSTROUS TRACTORS% AND AND HEROES THAT THAT MANICURED ALL DAY LONG. SO IN PERFECT CONDITIONS YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD RACE TRACK VERY CONSISTORIES TRACKS OFF I'M TRAINING WORSE OVER THAT SERVICE I CAN EXPECT THAT THREE DAYS FROM NOW IF I TAKE HIM OUT THERE AGAIN. HE WILL TRAIN OR A VERY SIMILAR SERVICE HOWEVER IF I HAVE BEEN TRAINING OVER THAT SERVICE AND NOW I RACE THE HORSE OVER A SERVICE THAT'S BEEN SEALED. IT'S HARDER. IT'S MUCH MORE FIRM THAN WHAT THE THE HORSE HAD BEEN TRAINING ON CELL THAT'S TODAY TODAY'S RAINING AND WE RACE ON THAT SERVICE. TOMORROW THE SUN COMES BACK OUT WHAT WE STILL HAVE A MUDDY. SURFACE THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE HORSES MEANT TRAINING ON IT'S A COMBINATION OF THAT BURIED SERVICE IT'S DIFFERENT. AND OF COURSE THAT IS SUSCEPTIBLE WE HAVE. SUSCEPTIBLE TO INJURY WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS FROM BERNIE CROPSEY STUDIES. AND BY THE WAY THAT DEBT AS COMPARED WITH INJURY DATABASES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IN ALMOST 90%. OF FATAL INJURIES. THERE IS PRE EXISTING PATH OLOGY NOW SOME OF THAT MIGHT GO BACK TO WIN THE WORSE WAS ON THE FARM AS A YEARLING. AND INJURED A LEG AND IT MAY NOT. BE EVIDENT EVEN EVEN WITH A DIGITAL RADIOLOGY IT MAY NOT BE EVIDENT. SO BECAUSE THESE ARE ANIMALS AND WE WE THE IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT TO YOU KNOW PERFORM. IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO PERFORM THINGS LIKE CAT SCANS AND MRI EYES ON ON ON THESE ANIMALS -- YOU'D HAVE TO SEDATE THEM DRAMATICALLY TO GET THEM TO WITHSTAND IT PASTA TO JUST INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE ACT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT DOESN'T EXIST. FOR RACE HORSES SO IT'S ALL OF THOSE FACTORS SIR AND I TELL YOU WE DO IT'S THE IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT THING THAT WE WE DEAL WITH AS A REGULATORY BODY -- HIM. EVERY YEAR I GUESS HOW DO YOU AT WHAT POINT. I MEAN IS THERE IS THERE A THRESHOLD OF DEATHS AT THESE RACE. TRACKS WHERE YOU WERE FINALLY TRIGGERS -- A DECISION TO SHUT DOWN OR HOW HOW DO YOU EVALUATE THAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S DIFFICULT LIKE I TOTALLY GET THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS -- BUT WITH THOSE APPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO BE THERE WHETHER HAVING TEN DEATHS OR HUNDRED OR FIVE HUNDRED DEATHS AT YOU KNOW -- AGAIN IN THE CONTEXT OF OF WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING YOU KNOW THIS IS -- IN BY THE WAY I IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SIT HER BEFORE YOU AND TALK ABOUT ALL THESE GAINS THAT WE'VE MADE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. IN THE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE HORSES WHICH IS TRUE THAT STATISTICAL. AND YET IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME ALL OF A SUDDEN. WE HAVE THE SITUATION AT SANTA ANITA -- THAT CONTRADICTS WHAT I'VE JUST SAID -- WE ADDRESS THE SITUATION AS IT COMES UP WE HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION AT DEL MAR THREE SUMMERS AGO -- WHERE WE HAD A NUMBER OF FORCES ON THE TURF COURSE THERE -- SUFFER FATAL INJURIES WE HAD LIKE SIX IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS. AND WE CONVINCED MANAGEMENT WAS VERY COOPERATIVE. TO TAKE ALL THE RACING OFF OF THE TURF COURSE [inaudible] THEY DID. AND THE TREND STOPPED. SO WE'RE AT THE SIMILAR STAGE NOW I WOULD SAY WE'VE HAD IT'S BEEN. SPEND POSITIVE SINCE THEN. AGAIN WE HAVE THESE GOOD RESULTS NOW WE HAVE THIS [inaudible] SITUATION THAT. IT COULD BE A COMBINATION OF THE RACETRACK. THE THE HORSE THAT THAT MAY HAVE SUFFERED AN INJURY REGARDLESS THE RACE TRACK. AND THE FACT THAT WE DO SEA ANOMALIES NOW AND THEN AND TO USUALLY WE ONLY. PUT OUT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FATALITIES THAT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ONE WE HAVE ALL THE NEW CROPS HE'S BACK AND WE KNOW WHAT THE WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THE CAUSE AND EFFECT IS. SO WE'VE TAKEN THIS FIRST STEP OF OF CONVINCING THE RACE TRACK TO SHUT DOWN. THEY'VE TOLD US THAT IF THAT WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE THEY'VE TAKEN THE THERE'S DIFFERENT COMPONENTS TO THE RACE TRACTORS THE CUSHION WHICH IS A SOFT PART. ON TOP WHICH IS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF INCHES UNDERNEATH THAT IS A PAD A PAD OF OF A PRETTY FIRM SAND. THEN UNDERNEATH THAT IS THE BASE SEVERAL LAYERS AGES AND SO FORTH. SO THEY'VE PEELED AWAY THE TOP PART OF IT THEY'VE EVALUATED NOW WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THIS MAN -- MAKE PETERSON ACTUALLY AS PIECE OF SONAR EQUIPMENT THAT MEASURES THE HARDNESS -- ALL THE WAY AROUND THE RACETRACK TO DOING THAT TODAY THEY'VE THEY'VE. ASSURED US THAT IF THEY FIND THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS. THAT THEY WILL NOT ONLY CANCEL TRAINING TOMORROW BUT POSSIBLY CANCEL RACING ON THURSDAY DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY FIND COME. VISIT LAST QUESTION DID YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MANY. COURSES YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA DIE THIS YEAR AND AND ON TRACKS FROM THE STATE. WELL THIS LAST CALENDAR YEAR INDIAN RACING AND TRAINING SO I'M NOT COUNTING CALL OCCURRED AND I'M AN ARTIST OR SOMETHING NINETY FOUR WERE LOST. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT AND MORE LIKE A MORE. HIGHER THIS YEAR THAN LAST SO FAR AS THE RAIN SEE -- YEAH WE ARE YEAH OF COURSE IT'S A SHORT WINDOW CALENDAR YEAR WISE IS YOUR WINDOW FISCAL YEAR FROM JULY FIRST TOLL NOW. IT'S SLIGHTLY WORSE THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR AND NOW YOU'VE LAST YEAR WAS THE BEST IN. TWENTY YEARS. SO THE NUMBERS THIS YEAR ARE NOT AS GOOD AS LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE FIGURES THAT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT HERE'S THE THING THEY WERE FOR CAMERA AT SANTA ANITA THIS MORNING. AND WE'VE TRIED TO TO CONVINCE MANAGEMENT [inaudible] THAT. DON'T WAIT FOR US TO SHUT YOU DOWN. DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO DO TO STOP THIS. AND HEY BECAUSE OF THE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF A HORSE AND IT BEING THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT BE BECAUSE THERE'S EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO THIS NOT ONLY NOT ONLY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T COME TO THE RACE TRACK BUT PEOPLE THAT DO COME TO THE RACETRACK AND SEE THIS AND SO IT'S IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THIS JOB TO TALK ABOUT AND IT'S THE ONE WHERE WE FEEL -- THAT WE HAVE. WE FEEL LIKE WE WE WE HAVE A FEW OPTIONS. AS I'VE DESCRIBED [inaudible] CENTER GALGIANI. IF I'M AN OWNER OF A **** AND I A DECIDE THAT BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER I DON'T WANT MY HORSE TRAINING OR RACING ON A PARTICULAR DAY. DO I HAVE THAT OPTION TO PULL MY HORSE WE DO AND AND AND MY PENALIZED FOR IT THOUGH. NO YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT PENALIZE YOU CAN YOU CAN -- AND YOU WOULD DO IT THREE OR TRAINER -- YOU IT'S DO YOU TELL YOUR TRAINER NOT TO RUN MY HORSE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION THERE'S NO PENALTY FOR FOR HAVING OF A HORSE WITHDRAWN BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE TRACK CONDITIONS OKAY. AND WE'VE NOT SEEN THIS KIND OF RAIN IN THE STATE FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS SO I WOULD. I MEAN I THINK CLEARLY IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND AND CHANGES THAT. WERE UNANTICIPATED AND HADN'T BEEN PREPARED FOR ON PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE CONDITIONS THAT ARE LAID OUT -- AND ON THOSE PARTICULAR DAYS WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS EXIST AND MAY BE. ON THAT DAY HORSES SHOULDN'T BE TRAINED AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE RACING I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT THE THE RACETRACK WILL CANCEL TRAINING -- WHE IN AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SIMPLY TO PROTECT HORSES TO BE HONEST THEY'RE PREPARING THEY NEED THAT THEY WILL? SHUT DOWN THE TRACK TO PROTECTED SO THAT IT'S NOT TORN UP AFTERWARDS IS BEEN RUNNING ON IT AND THEN IT STARTS TO RAIN. THAN THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER MAINTENANCE OF THE RACE TRACK. SO -- THEY WILL DO THAT LREADY NGUYEN DISCUSSIONS WITH MANAGEMENT OVER THE WEEKEND -- THEY INDICATED THAT IN THE FUTURE WITH HOPE. WHAT WE CALL A SLOPPY RACETRACK WHICH IS ONE AT THE BEGINNING OF A RAINSTORM IN THE WATERS MOSTLY ON TOP OF THE TRACK? THEY WILL CONSIDER CANCELLING RACING AT THAT POINT -- AGAIN THIS IS A MANAGEMENT DECISION THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE IT'S NOT A REGULATORY DECISION AT THIS POINT SHORT OF CHANGING THE LAW -- OR ADOPTING A REGULATION -- THE ONLY THING THAT THE BOARD CAN DO AS I SAID IS PUSH THEM -- AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK AND STOP THEM [inaudible] HE IT IS MADE.
