WELL.

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:03.101
BEYOND TRADITIONAL DESKTOP

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.603
COMPUTERS AND I LOOK AT THE

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:05.737
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:06.972
I'M NOT TELLING YOU ANYTHING

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:08.106
THAT YOU.

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.908
DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:11.643
BUT TODAY'S ELECTRONIC DEVICES

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.445
THAT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET AND

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.379
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.915
FIVE BILLION OF THEM.

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.450
THEY INCLUDE MICROWAVES AND

00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:21.553
REFRIGERATORS AND HOME DEVICES.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.054
LIKE THERMOSTATS AND SECURITY

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:25.223
CAMERAS UNFORTUNATELY A

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.925
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:27.726
DEVICES.

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:29.294
LACK EVEN THE MOST BASIC

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.263
SECURITY FEATURES.

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:33.665

USER ACCESS CONTROLS.

00:25:36.101 --> 00:25:37.869
BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST.

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:40.739
OUR INTERNET CONNECTED TOYS.

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.340
AND THE RISKS THAT THEY POSE TO

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:44.476
OUR CHILDREN AND THIS IS WHAT.

00:25:44.542 --> 00:25:46.044
DREW ME TO THIS ISSUE --

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.545
ORIGINALLY.

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:49.247
THE KELLY DAHLE.

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:51.416
WHICH THE COUNTRY OF GERMANY HAS

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:53.952
NOW BANNED AND CONFISCATED.

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:55.921
BECAUSE THEY ALLOWED ANYONE TO

00:25:55.987 --> 00:25:58.723
BE ABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.958
THAT THEY WOULD GLEAN FROM

00:26:00.025 --> 00:26:00.926
CHILDREN.

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:03.795
OR DIRECT CHILDREN GO TO PLACES.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:06.464
WHERE THEY WOULD BE UNSAFE?

00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:09.100
THE THE IMAGINATION AND

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:12.570
INVENTIVENESS OF THE HUMAN MIND

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:14.739
IS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED AND THE

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:15.840
GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:17.709
USE FOR GOOD.

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:19.110

RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND AS I

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:25.383
MENTION THAT THIS AT ALL.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.152
HAS A SECURITY FLAW.

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:28.954
THAT ALLOW STRANGERS TO SPEAK

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.522

HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF STRANGERS

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.098
TALKING TO CHILDREN THROUGH

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:42.968

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:59.517

SECURITY PARTICULARLY MOTOR

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:36.581
VEHICLES WHICH THESE DAYS ARE

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:38.983
BASICALLY COMPUTERS ON WHEELS.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:40.685
AND ESPECIALLY EASY BECOME

MANY OF ITS VEHICLES BECAUSE

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.268
THERE WAS A FLAW THAT ALLOWED

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.737
HACKERS TO REMOTELY CONTROL THEM.

00:33:59.804 --> 00:34:02.740
POSING IN ON PRESIDENT DANGER.

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:05.376

THE ROADS.

00:34:08.346 --> 00:34:10.381
AND HACKERS COULD CUT THE BRAKES

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.016
SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE DRIVER OFF

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:13.751
THE ROAD OR MAKE ALL THE

00:34:13.818 --> 00:34:15.753
ELECTRONICS GO HAYWIRE.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.156
THERE ARE NO FEDERAL STANDARDS

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.490
UNFORTUNATELY --

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.426
REGARDING MOTOR VEHICLE SEACM

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:23.828

STATES TO ACT ON THAT.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.698
AND WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.801
FBI IS ONE THAT ECONOMIST CARS

00:34:29.867 --> 00:34:32.036
COULD BE USED AS LETHAL WEAPONS.

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:35.673
AND THEY HAVE PREDICTED THAT IT

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.508
THOMAS CARS WILL HAVE QUOTE A

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:40.044
HIGH IMPACT ON TRANSFORMING WHAT

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.546
BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ITS

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:42.980

CAN OPERATIONALLY TO WITH A CAR --

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:48.920
SO WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.221
THAT AND I THINK ANTICIPATE

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:52.490

THAT'S NOW.

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.456
IT'S SITTARD REASONABLE SECURITY

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.191
YOU TAKE OUT YOUR LAPTOP BEFORE

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.559

MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:32.970
ASSOCIATION WHERE IT SOMEWHAT

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.805
UNUSUAL POSITION ON THIS BILL

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.340
AND THAT WE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN A

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:37.842
POSITION --

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:39.410
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:39:39.477 --> 00:39:41.011
TO MEET WITH SENATOR JACKSON'S

DISCUSS OUR ISSUES --

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:47.818
AND THOSE COMPANIES WERE VERY

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.153
PRODUCTIVE OUTS WERE HOPING TO

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.422
CONTINUE BUT OUT WE HAVE BEEN

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:53.290
OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TO THE

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.826
COMPANION BILL TO SB --

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.528
THREE TWENTY SEVEN WHICH IS AB

00:39:57.595 --> 00:40:00.531
NINETEEN OH SIX AND WE PER TO

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:01.098
THIS COMMITTEE WHEN IT WAS

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:01.499
INITIALLY HEARD --

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:03.701
AND BECAUSE THE BILLS HAVE

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.035
IDENTICAL LANGUAGE WE HAVE

00:40:05.102 --> 00:40:06.303
SIMILAR ISSUES --

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.972
WITH THIS BILL FIRST --

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.140
IS WITH THE DEFINITION OF

00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:10.474
MANUFACTURER --

00:40:10.541 --> 00:40:12.777
IT EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES PEOPLE

00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:15.045
THAT IMPORT --

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:17.114
AND RESELL CONNECTED DEVICES

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.449
UNDER THEIR OWN PRIVATE LABEL

00:40:18.516 --> 00:40:20.117
THIS IS AN ISSUE OF FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.552
SENATOR JACKSON MENTIONED A

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.821
YOUNG MY CHINESE MANUFACTURER

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.389
THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO BE

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.724
COVERED BY THIS BILL.

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:27.792
AYE BECAUSE THEY ARE A CHINESE

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:29.360
MANUFACTURER AND THEY DO NOT

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:30.961
SELL THEIR PRODUCTS TO END USERS

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.429
THE ONLY WAY THAT THEIR PRODUCTS

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:34.165
INTO THE MARKET IS THROUGH THE

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:35.266
WORK --

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:36.634
IMPORTERS --

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.502
THAT.

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:40.171
IMPORTANT IS ALREADY EXISTING

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.339
MANUFACTURED DEVICES THAT THEY

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:42.940
DON'T CONTRACT FOR THE ALREADY

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:43.440
SOURCE.

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.208
THE IMPORT THEM TO THE

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.110
CALIFORNIA MARKET THEY PUT THEIR

00:40:46.177 --> 00:40:47.178
PRIVATE LABEL ON THEM AND THEY

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:48.412
RESULT.

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.580
IN THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS OF AB

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:50.881
NINETEEN A SIX A GOOD EXAMPLE OF

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:53.017
THIS IS THE COMPANY TRENDNET IN

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:54.885
THEIR SECURE VIEW CAMERAS --

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.154
THAT ISSUE IT'S IS CAUSED BY

00:40:57.221 --> 00:40:58.856
THOSE IMPORT AS A RESELLER SO AS

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:00.524
LONG AS THE DEFINITION OF OF

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:01.525
MANUFACTURE EXCLUDES THOSE

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.994
PEOPLE WE CAN NEVER HAVE A TRULY

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:05.095
CYBER -- SHE

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:05.696
CYBERSECURITY BOTH GOING TO

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:06.931
FRUSTRATE THE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:08.599
BILL BECAUSE SENATORS UNSECURE

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.568
DEVICES ARE ON OUR NETWORKS --

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:11.936
ALL THE EFFORT THAT WE MAKE TO

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.671
SECURE OUR DEVICES ARE MOOT AYE

00:41:13.737 --> 00:41:14.939
IT ALSO PLACES AT A COMPETITIVE

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.006
DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THESE

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:17.174
PEOPLE INCREASE THEIR MARKET

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:19.877
SHARE -- OUR

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.713
MANUFACTURERS THAT DO THINGS BY

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.981
THESE CHEAPER UNSECURE DEVICES

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:26.917
BUT THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.252
REASONABLENESS TEST WE BELIEVE

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.854
IT SHOULD INCLUDE OR SHOULD BE

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.489
TIED TO A BROADER --

00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:34.558
NUMBER OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS ARE

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:35.926
DEVELOPED BY TWO SECURITY ENTRY

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:38.128
EXPERTS OR OTHER CREDITED BODIES

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.296
THAT ADDRESS --

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:40.965
FORESEEABLE VULNERABILITIES

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:43.267
RIGHT NOW THE BILL EXPRESSLY --

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.501
EXPERT MOVES LIABILITY OF

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:46.670
COMPANIES ADOPT PASSWORDS BUT IF

00:41:46.737 --> 00:41:48.405
A COMPANY WERE TO ADOPT MORE

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:49.807
SECURE MEANS THAT A PASSWORD

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:51.408
IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AS

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:52.877
TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD BE --

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:54.211
LIABLE UNDER THIS BILL NOT FROM

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.312
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE DOESN'T

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:57.781
MAKE ANY SENSE WE DO MORE THAN A

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:58.816
PASSWORD OUT WE SHOULD.

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.985
BE DEEMED REASONABLE SO UNTIL

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.686
THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED WE WE

00:42:02.753 --> 00:42:03.687
DON'T THINK THAT THE BILL SHOULD

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:04.588
BE -- MOVED

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:06.023
FORWARD BUT WE CAPITA

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:07.524
CONVERSATION SO FAR WITH BOTH

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:08.826
ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN OFFICE

STANDARD IS.

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.567
AND I AGREE THAT THE BILL LACKS

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:25.002
A LOT OF SPECIFICITY IN THAT

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:26.770

TO CHANGE.

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:38.215

AND BROUGHT TO THE INDUSTRY CAN

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.190
MAKE ITS OWN.

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:47.791
DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT IS

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:50.427
REASONABLE AND AND WE EXPECT IT

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.662

THAN WE DO.

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:56.233
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.802
ESSENTIALLY SHOWS NO THIS WORLD

00:43:58.869 --> 00:44:00.504
BETTER THAN ANYONE THEN TAKE

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.239
THOSE REASONABLE STEPS BASED

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:03.807
UPON THE DATA AND THE

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:07.077
INFORMATION THAT YOUR PARTICULAR --

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.045
DEVICE --

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:11.482
GENERATES SO IT IS A IT IT

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.384
ALLOWS INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.251
THOSE.

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.120
A REASONABLE DOESN'T TAKE BEST

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:18.088
PRACTICES IT'S HAS REASONABLE

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:18.956

THERE'S ALWAYS A CONCERN ABOUT

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:24.795
LITIGATION BUT OF THIS BILL

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.096
GIVES THOSE POWERS TO THE

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.664
ATTORNEY GENERAL SO WE'RE NOT

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:29.967

BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.374
DOES IT'S WHAT'S.

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.842
WHAT OF THE REASONABLE

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:40.811
APPROACHES TAKEN GIVEN THE

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:42.546
PERIOD OF TIME AND WIN WITHIN

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:43.647
WHICH THOSE?

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:45.449
EFFORTS ARE MADE AS THINGS

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:46.950

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:50.187
A DAILY BASIS YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:50.387

VULNERABILITIES.

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:01.065
AND ADDRESS THEM IN THAT FASHION

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.900
SO -- THERE

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:05.069
IS FLEXIBILITY HERE SO THAT THE

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:07.371
INDUSTRY CAN ADAPT BECAUSE WE

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:08.605
KNOW HOW QUICKLY THINGS ARE

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:09.540
MOVING SO RATHER THAN HAVE IT

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:11.008
SET.

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.177
SO THAT YOU FIX IT IS A POINT IN

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:14.745
TIME.

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:17.047
THE INDUSTRY WILL KNOW THAT AS

00:45:17.114 --> 00:45:19.917

I'M NOT GONNA TRY TO CAUSE

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:20.637
PROBLEMS FOR HIM JUST SAYING

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:21.939
THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE KIND

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:23.273
OF THINGS THAT IF I'M MAKING A

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.174
CONNECTED DEVICE I NEED TO KNOW

00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:26.009
THAT STUFF.

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:28.745
AND I I HAD THE UNUSUAL.

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.414
THE EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR OF

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.582
READING EIGHT COURT TRANSCRIPT

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.251
OF A ROOM FULL OF LAWYERS

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.286
ARGUING ABOUT A BILL THAT I HAD

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:37.955
PASSED TWO YEARS BEFORE AND THEY

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:38.989
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.057
WHAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:41.391
AUTHOR WILL THE AUTHOR CLEARLY

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:42.192
INTENDED TO DO THERE'S NO WE

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:43.026
DIDN'T?

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:44.261
AND I'M THINKING I'M THE AUTHOR

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.662
YOU COULD ASK ME IF YOU WANT TO

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:46.863
KNOW WHAT MY INTENT WAS PUT ARE

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.165
MADE IT ILLUSTRATES THE POINT

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.833
THAT WHAT WE DO HERE REALLY

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.801
MATTERS THE WORDS WE USE IN THE

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:51.235
BILL.

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:52.936
REALLY MATTER BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:53.670
GOING TO ARGUE ABOUT IT AND I

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.105
WOULD JUST IF IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:57.841
REQUIRE THIS KIND OF SECURITY.

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.876
FOR CONNECTED DEVICES I THINK WE

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:01.845
OWE IT TO EVERYBODY. TO BE VERY

00:48:01.912 --> 00:48:02.613
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.047
REQUIRING CANNOT JUST LEAVE IT

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:06.550
OPEN TO INTERPRETATION.

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:07.551
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:09.319
PROBLEM IS AT IF WE FIX WHAT IT

00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:11.521
IS THAT WE EXPECT THEM TO DO IN

00:48:11.588 --> 00:48:14.157
TWO WEEKS THE OF THE THE ENTIRE

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:15.892
TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE SHIFTED.

00:48:15.959 --> 00:48:17.861
AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:21.431
GIVING THE THE INDUSTRY WHICH

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.367
KNOWS AND KNOWS BEST HOW TO

00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.067
PROTECT.

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:27.738
THE INFORMATION TO OUR USE THAT

00:48:27.804 --> 00:48:28.972
KNOWLEDGE TO PROTECT THE

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:30.007
INFORMATION.

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:31.642
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:33.076
DOING IS SAYING LOOK FOLKS.

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:34.211
THERE ARE CERTAIN EXPECTATIONS

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.479
WE HAVE.

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:36.580
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PROTECT

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:38.315
THIS INFORMATION YOU USE

00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:40.350
WHATEVER REASONABLE TECHNIQUES

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.452
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT [inaudible]

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:46.023
AND AGAIN IF A PASSWORD IS

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:48.258
LOCATED DAY IN TWO WEEKS A

00:48:48.325 --> 00:48:49.059
PASSWORD WON'T BE THE ANSWER

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:49.359
[inaudible]

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:52.429
AND BUT NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:53.497
THEY'RE BETTER THAN THE INDUSTRY

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:54.998
SO -- ARE

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:57.601
I'M YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO TALK

00:48:57.668 --> 00:49:00.337
ABOUT OF REDIFF OR OR NARROWING

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.039
OR SPEED BEING MORE SPECIFIC

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.507
WITH THE DEFINITIONS BUT I WOULD

00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:04.141
SUGGEST.

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:06.810
THAT THE MANUFACTURERS KNOW NOW

00:49:06.877 --> 00:49:07.978
WHAT [inaudible]

00:49:08.045 --> 00:49:09.579
THE PUBLIC.

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:11.081
ISN'T LIKELY TO KNOW FOR AWHILE

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:13.050
BECAUSE THEY ARE AT THE CUTTING

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:15.919
EDGE AND WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:17.487
TO TAKE THE REASONABLE STEPS TO

00:49:17.554 --> 00:49:19.156
PROTECT THAT INFORMATION.

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:21.458
AND GIVING THEM A WIDE BERTH --

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.593
MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE THEM

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.162
AND THEIR CREATIVE --

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:27.831
KNOWLEDGE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.399
SO -- AGAIN

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.967
YES YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS SAY IF

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:31.902

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:35.172
GET FOUR OPINIONS BUT AT IT YOU

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:35.806
KNOW THAT.

00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.507
A AGAIN WE'RE LEAVING TO THE

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:39.876
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVALUATE

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.778

NEW COLLEAGUE HERE I'M

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:46.083
RECOVERING MYSELF ON THE

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.617
PROFESSION SO --

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:49.586

OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:53.156
ARE BUT THE THE THE BOTTOM LINE

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.958
IS WE WANT THE INDUSTRY TO BE IN

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:56.993
THE FOREFRONT OF THIS NOT TO BE

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.462
PRO SCRIPTED.

00:49:58.528 --> 00:50:00.464

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.843
POINTS THE OPPOSITION RAISED WAS

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:13.443
AN EXCELLENT ONE WHICH IS THAT

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.644

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:21.952
PICK AN INDUSTRY STANDARD AND

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.920

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:24.187
INDUSTRY.

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:27.023

THE DEFINITION OF MANUFACTURER

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:21.091

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:53.757
DISAGREE WITH THE VIEW THAT WE

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:55.892

DEVICE WAS PURCHASED.

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:37.187

THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF

00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:38.882
THESE ISSUES I I'M SORRY THAT I

FAR AS AND THERE IS IN THE BILL

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:49.192
IF THERE ARE FEDERAL STANDARDS

EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL.

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:58.401
A THE SECOND THING IS WHEN WE

ABOUT TO ADD THIS DISADVANTAGING

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:07.510
CALIFORNIA COMPANIES WE DID

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:09.145
CHANGE THE LANGUAGE AFTER

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:11.447
PRIVACY --

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:12.982

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.851
AND IF IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WILL

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:16.252
LOOK AT IT SOME MORE BUT

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:17.253
CERTAINLY THAT WAS THAT WAS

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.888
NEVER THE INTENTION TO

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:20.256
DISADVANTAGE CALIFORNIA

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:22.792
MANUFACTURERS AND AND I WILL

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.527

LIKE I DID AND PRIVACY AND IN

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:27.797
FRONT OF YOUR COMMITTEE THAT WE

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:29.365
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:30.500
SINCE.

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:33.036
LAST FALL AND IT HAS GONE

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:36.272
THROUGH MULTIPLE MULTIPLE --

00:59:36.339 --> 00:59:38.341
AND I HAVE VERSIONS TO MAKE SURE

00:59:38.408 --> 00:59:40.076
THAT WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF

00:59:40.143 --> 00:59:40.944
GROUPS LIKE THE INTERNET

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:43.513
ASSOCIATION CAL CHAMBER --

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:46.482
TECHNET AND MOST OF MOST OF

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:48.551
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL OF

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:49.752
THEM EXCEPT --

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.321
FOR THE MANUFACTURERS ARE EITHER

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.389
NEUTRAL OR IN SUPPORT OF THE

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.692
BILL SO AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:57.527
TRY TO MAKE THIS A VERY VERY

00:59:57.593 --> 01:00:00.163
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND AGAIN --

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.298
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT IN

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:03.599
MY OPINION THAT WE PASSED

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.401
SOMETHING THAT STARTS TO AT

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.669
LEAST REGULATE SOME OF THESE AYE

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:09.672
OTA DEVICES BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN --

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.275
WITHOUT REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE.

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:14.610
YOU KNOW AN INCREDIBLE PROBLEMS

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.412
AND TO WHOM WE CAN LOOK AT

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.648
THINGS LIKE THAT THE BIG --

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.717
TAKEOVER OF DYING WARY YOU'RE

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.617
BRINGING DOWN PART OF THE

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.286
INTERNET BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:26.489
APPROPRIATE SO I'M SECURITY ON

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:27.423
THESE AYE OF TWO DEVICES I THINK

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.459
THIS IS NOT A HUGE STEP THIS IS

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.560
A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.195
DIRECTION SO I'M.

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:32.829
DEATHLY IN SUPPORT OF AND WHAT

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:35.631
THE SENATE DOING AND I THINK

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:36.399
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.701
TO WORK WITH --

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:40.803
THE LAST FEW HOLD OUTS BUT AGAIN

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.238
IF THEY WANT A FEDERAL STANDARD

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.974
THEY WOULD BE EXEMPTED.

BREACH LANGUAGE FROM THE BILL

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:16.812
OBVIOUSLY WITH AB THREE SEVENTY

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:42.438
WE CERTAINLY AGREE IN THE

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:44.673
CONCEPT OF MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.109
PR A IS EXPLICITLY LIMITED TO

LOOK WE WOULD THE WORLD IS

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:35.449
CHANGING AT A AT A BREAKNECK

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:36.050
SPEED.

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.051
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:38.152
WE FACE AND GOVERNMENT IS WE

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.654
JUST DON'T HARMONIZE WITH EACH

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.856
THAT CHANGE WE'RE REACTIVE

01:32:41.923 --> 01:32:44.325
ORGANIZATION.

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.693
BUT IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE TOP

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.928
OF THE FOOT CENTEX TOP FIFTY

01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:49.063
COMPANIES ELEVEN OF THOSE.

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.965
UNDER FORBES' LIST ARE

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:52.366
BLOCKCHAIN COMPANIES.

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.167
THEN WE GENERALLY LOOK AT

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.770
BLOCKCHAIN IN WE HEAR THE TERM

01:32:55.836 --> 01:32:57.305
AND WE ONLY ASSOCIATE IT WITH

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:59.040
THE IDEA.

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:02.843
OF OF OF BUT A BIT COINS AND

01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:04.545
IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL.

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:06.380
ITS AWAY TO REORGANIZE SOME OF

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.049
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WITH

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:10.284
THE INTERNET.

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.285
WHAT DOES THE INTERNET IT IN

01:33:11.352 --> 01:33:13.721
THIS PROVIDE EXPLOSIVELY

01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:15.256
VALUABLE?

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:18.092
AT THAT ASPECTS TO OUR LIVES ALL

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:19.360
ACROSS THE WORLD PEOPLE IN

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.962
COUNTRIES THAT COULDN'T GET

01:33:21.028 --> 01:33:22.096
ACCESS TO STUFF.

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:25.132
HAVE SWITCHED UNBELIEVABLE AND

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.100
CERTAINLY THIS COMMITTEE JUST

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:26.867
OUT WITH THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:29.103
SHORN THE CHALLENGES IMPOSED BY

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:30.404
THE INTERNET.

01:33:30.471 --> 01:33:31.906
BUT IN ADDITION TO THE PRIVACY

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:33.474
ISSUE WITH THE UNDERLYING ISSUE

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:34.442
SECURITY.

01:33:34.508 --> 01:33:36.777
WHAT THE BLOCKCHAIN DOES IF YOU

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:38.379
HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY IT'LL IT

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.114
BASICALLY WILL BE ORGANIZES HOW

01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:42.717
THE INTERNET INFORMATION?

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:46.620
ARE IS IS IS BE ACCESS SINCE IN

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:48.189
THE SIMPLEST TERMS IF YOU HAVE A

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.957
BLOCK OF INFORMATION EACH BLOCK

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.759
OF INFORMATION IS STAMPED IN

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:52.526
TIME.

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:54.362
WITH UNIQUE TIME STAMP EACH JUST

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:55.997
PARTICULARLY STAMP OF THAT

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.698
PARTICULAR CODE.

01:33:57.765 --> 01:33:59.066
AND THEN EACH TASK IS TO IS

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.234
CODED TO THE PIECE OF

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:01.769
INFORMATION BEFORE.

01:34:01.836 --> 01:34:03.270
AND AFTER IT.

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.071
SO IT'S I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S

01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:05.940
IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S YOU

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:06.741
KNOW I THINK SOMEHOW IN THE

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:07.541
FUTURE.

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:08.876
BUT IT CERTAINLY PROVIDES AN

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:11.545
EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF SECURITY

01:34:11.612 --> 01:34:13.547
THAT WE DON'T OTHERWISE HAVE.

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:16.050
SECOND IS STILL OUT THERE BUT

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.051
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO LIVE ON THE

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:18.953
MOON ONCE IN AWHILE --

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.521
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.656
STEP FORWARD TOWARD [inaudible]

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.892
DEMOCRATIZATION ECONOMIC

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:27.028
OPPORTUNITY IN THE INTERNET

01:34:27.094 --> 01:34:28.262
WHAT'S HAPPENED THE INTERNET

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.964
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE BEEN ABLE TO

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.632
MAKE SO MUCH MONEY.

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:33.734
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND TENS

01:34:33.801 --> 01:34:35.036
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WATCH

01:34:35.102 --> 01:34:36.337
BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTROLLING THE

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:37.338
ADVERTISING A CONTROLLING IS A

01:34:37.405 --> 01:34:38.572
UNITED BALLS.

01:34:38.639 --> 01:34:39.540
THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN'T GET A

01:34:39.607 --> 01:34:41.208
PIECE OF THAT.

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:42.243
SO I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:43.778
HAPPEN WITH BLOCKCHAIN THE

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.146
NOTION IS CALLED TOKENIZATION

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:46.714
BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:47.815
ABLE TO GET PAID FOR DISLIKING

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:49.683
IT REWARDS POINTS FOR USING YOUR

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.919
CREDIT CARD OR MILEAGE A SUBJECT

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:52.319
THAT.

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:53.421
YOU CAN SEE A SIMILAR SYSTEM IS

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.021
STARTING TO HAPPEN AROUND THE

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.557
COUNTRY AND THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:57.691
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:34:57.758 --> 01:34:58.292
SO WHAT HAVE I DONE WITH THIS

01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:59.760
BILL.

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:02.096
TRYING TO INTRODUCE THIS VERY

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:04.598
COMPLEX CONCEPT INTO GOVERNMENT.

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.967
I TRIED TO INTRODUCE IT WITH A

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.702
LIKE THAT YOU WITH WITH TITLE.

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:10.304
A I MET WITH AMBASSADOR TO

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:11.872
VANUATU AND HE'S DOING ALL THIS

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.307
TITLE ON BLOCKCHAIN.

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.042
BUT HERE WE'VE GOT INTEREST

01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:16.077
ENTRENCHED INTERESTS AND IS NO

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:16.744
WAY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA KILL OFF

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:19.013
THE TITLE INSURANCE COMPANIES IF

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:19.647
WE DO THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:20.881
GONNA NEED A TITLE INSURANCE

01:35:20.948 --> 01:35:22.683
COMPANY PAY FOR INSURANCE.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:23.684

ABILITY OF OTHER FEDERAL LAW

01:49:28.895 --> 01:49:31.097

BARRIERS THAT'S THE GOAL.

01:50:56.516 --> 01:50:58.118
WHY PUT UP ANY BARRIERS BETWEEN

01:50:58.184 --> 01:51:01.121
NON ICE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVEN

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.122

THROUGH IN ORDER TO FIGHT CRIME --

01:51:09.596 --> 01:51:11.331

WHY PUT THOSE SHIPS BEFORE THEM

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:17.670
WHY IS THAT NECESSARY IF THE

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.039
GOAL IS TO BE PROTECTING PEOPLE

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:21.408
FROM ICE RATES WHICH AGAIN I AM

01:51:21.474 --> 01:51:23.009

DATA AS AS OUR WITNESSES WAS

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:30.183
SANE AND WE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS --

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:32.218
IS CERTAIN STATES LITERALLY IF

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:34.421
YOU HAD A SPANISH LAST NAME YOUR

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:35.588

LIST AND THEY GOT CENTER ICE.

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:38.725
I WOULD AND AND THAT'S WHAT

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.026
WE'RE TRYING.

01:51:40.093 --> 01:51:42.195
TO TELL PREVENT I MEAN WE DON'T

01:51:42.262 --> 01:51:43.096
WANNA OBVIOUSLY WANT TO DO

01:51:43.163 --> 01:51:44.464
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP IN THE

01:51:44.531 --> 01:51:46.099
EFFORTS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

01:51:46.166 --> 01:51:47.700
BUT WE FEEL THAT IT'S THE DATA

01:51:47.767 --> 01:51:49.402
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.036
HERE AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THE

01:51:50.103 --> 01:51:51.004
BILL.

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.539
WE WOULD HAVE YOU CONSIDERED

01:51:52.605 --> 01:51:56.042
JUST LIMITING ITS REACH TO ICE.

01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:58.311
INSTEAD OF ALL THIRD PARTY MINT

01:51:58.378 --> 01:52:00.013
BECAUSE THAT IS VERY BROAD.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.381
I'M AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO MEND

01:52:01.448 --> 01:52:02.449
YOUR BILL ON THE FLY IN

01:52:02.515 --> 01:52:03.583
COMMITTING THAT --

01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:04.984
WE YOU KNOW HAVE HAD IS THERE

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:06.352
REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT MADE IT

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:07.253
THAT [inaudible]

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.956
NARROWING SURGICAL.

01:52:10.023 --> 01:52:13.059
MEANWHILE THE BILL IS ALSO FOCUS

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.594
HAS A LOT OF FOCUS ON ICE IT IS

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:16.896
ALSO JUST --

01:52:16.963 --> 01:52:19.132
GOOD PRIVACY PROTECTION TO LIMIT

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.200
DISCLOSURE OF THIS VERY

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:21.835
SENSITIVE INFORMATION YOU TURN

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:22.669
OVER.

01:52:22.735 --> 01:52:24.871
ALLOTTED DATA TO BOOK A HOTEL

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:26.906
ROOM OR REVOKE --

01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:28.675
A BUS TICKET AND SO WE THOUGHT

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:31.311
YOU KNOW THIS STRUCTURE GIVES

01:52:31.377 --> 01:52:33.680
GOOD PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND ALL

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:35.515
SENSE FOR ALL CONSUMERS --

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:37.317
OF THEIR DATA AND THOUGHT IT

01:52:37.383 --> 01:52:39.419
STRUCK A REASONABLE BALANCE ON

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:41.788
WHO THE LAWS DISCLOSURES TO IN

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.389
THE CONTEXT THAT IT ALLOWS.

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:45.191
DISCLOSURES TO WITH A COURT

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:47.494
ORDER A WARRANT IF SOMEONE IS

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.462
TARGETING A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS

01:52:49.529 --> 01:52:50.663
AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:52.298
INVESTIGATION.

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:53.967
IT SEEMS THAT THERE WOULD BE THE

01:52:54.033 --> 01:52:56.769
ABILITY TO GET WARRANTS FOR THIS

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:58.705
INFORMATION CAME HERE IT SEEMS

01:52:58.771 --> 01:52:59.806
IT WOULD BE THE ABILITY TO GET

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:00.773
WARRANTS YOU MAY BE CORRECT

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.108
THAT'S VERY THEORETICAL AND I'M

01:53:02.175 --> 01:53:03.143
THINKING OF WHO ARE THE VICTIMS

01:53:03.209 --> 01:53:04.244
OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOW

01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:06.946
PREVALENT IT IS HOW EASY IT.

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:07.113
IS.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.615
TO SKIRT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SO

01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:09.749
MANY WAYS HOW DIFFICULT THE

01:53:09.816 --> 01:53:12.919
CRIMES ARE TO PROSECUTE AND IF

01:53:12.986 --> 01:53:14.888
THE GOAL IS DATA PROTECTION IT'S

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:16.222
JUST GOOD POLICY TO HAVE A BE ON

01:53:16.289 --> 01:53:18.291
ICE WE HAVE SOME OF WE'VE

01:53:18.358 --> 01:53:20.160
ACTUALLY BEEN PASSING THEM TODAY.

01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:21.394
AND IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:24.297
STATE HAS VERY RIGOROUS PRIVACY

01:53:24.364 --> 01:53:25.632
PROTECTIONS NOW.

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:27.700
FOR YOU KNOW BEST PRACTICES.

01:53:27.767 --> 01:53:30.403
ATTACKED CONSUMER DATA I JUST --

01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:32.839
I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY IN GREAT

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:34.340
HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER

01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:35.441
NARROWING THIS MUCH MORE

01:53:35.508 --> 01:53:37.076
SURGICALLY --

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:40.079
WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT PUT UP

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:41.014
OOPS BETWEEN.

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:44.083
A LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.652
TO GO AFTER HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO

01:53:45.718 --> 01:53:47.320
GO ACTIVE GO AFTER VICTIMS OF

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:49.989
CRIME AND THEY USED THESE

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:50.857
LEDGERS THEY USE THIS

01:53:50.924 --> 01:53:52.959
INFORMATION TO TRACK DOWN RINGS

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:53.993
I'VE HAD THREE HUMAN TRAFFICKING

01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.895
RINGS BROKEN UP IN MY DISTRICT

01:53:55.962 --> 01:53:57.063
JUST IN THE LAST THREE YEARS.

01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:59.566
AND SO I I REALLY STRONGLY

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:01.267
ENCOURAGE THAT --

01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:03.203
BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S OVER

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:04.103
BROAD AND I THINK THAT WHAT

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:06.940
ORIGINAL GOAL OF HAVE PROTECTING

01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:08.908
PEOPLE IN THEIR WORKPLACE.

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:10.076

01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:16.049
DO THAT THANK YOU.

01:54:16.115 --> 01:54:17.517
AS OUR IN DEPTH --

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:18.718
THAT WAS THE INTERESTING

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:20.587
DISCUSSION AYE AYE ME I'M.

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.755
SORT OF SURPRISED THAT THESE --

01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:23.957
IF WE'RE JUST WANNA PRIVACY THAT

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:25.158
THESE LETTERS ARE NOT ALREADY

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:27.360
PROTECTED THAT THAT THEY ARE

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.796
AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY THAT ASKS

01:54:29.862 --> 01:54:32.665
FOR THEM AND AND IS SPECIFICALLY

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.367
ON YOUR CONCERNS.

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:35.201
I THINK.

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:37.704
BUT I GUESS I CAN ASK THAT THE

01:54:37.770 --> 01:54:38.638
QUESTION.

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:39.339
HOW IF YOU HAVE A HUMAN

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:42.208
TRAFFICKING?

01:54:42.275 --> 01:54:44.377
GENERALLY IS IN A LOCAL.

01:54:44.444 --> 01:54:46.079
CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:54:46.145 --> 01:54:47.447
THAT'S GOING AFTER IT NOT

01:54:47.513 --> 01:54:48.982
NECESSARILY THE FEDS AND IF IT'S

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:49.949
THE FEDS WOULDN'T THEY BE

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.084
PARTNERING WITH LOCAL LAW

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:53.219
ENFORCEMENT HAVE.

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:54.687
HOWEVER WE USUALLY DEALING WITH

01:54:54.754 --> 01:54:55.255
SITUATIONS LIKE [inaudible]

01:54:55.321 --> 01:54:59.158
THAT.

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.727
I'M SORRY THAT IS NOT MY AREA OF

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:02.695
EXPERTISE Y. BE HAPPY TO LOOK

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:03.329
INTO THAT FOUND WITH PEOPLE WHO

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:04.998
WORK IN THAT FIELD I IMAGINE IT

01:55:05.064 --> 01:55:05.598
IS.

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:07.533
LOCALS THAT ARE OFTEN DOING THE

01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.902
ENFORCEMENT OF THAT BUT SO.

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:11.437
THE LOCALS IF THEY THINK THERE'S

01:55:11.504 --> 01:55:12.872
A CRIME CAN STILL GET THE LEDGER

01:55:12.939 --> 01:55:15.208
AND THERE IS NO RESTRICTIONS AT

01:55:15.275 --> 01:55:15.842
ALL.

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:17.644
AND FOR THE FEDS IF IT HAPPENS

01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:19.145
THERE INVOLVED WITHOUT THE

01:55:19.212 --> 01:55:21.781
LOCALS AND THEY CAN JUST GET A

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:23.883
SUBPOENA CROWD COURT ORDER

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:24.384
AWARENESS.

01:55:24.450 --> 01:55:25.918
AND BUT THIS IS WHAT THE

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:28.221
SITUATION IS RIGHT NOW THAT

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:29.055
LEDGER IS AVAILABLE.

01:55:29.122 --> 01:55:30.890
TO ALMOST ANY AGENCY WHICH TO ME

01:55:30.957 --> 01:55:32.292
SEEMS A PRIVATE LIKE A PRIVACY

01:55:32.358 --> 01:55:34.560
ISSUE SO I I I I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:36.329
THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT I MEAN

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:38.031
THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS TURNED

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:38.665
BEING TURNED OVER TO ICE I THINK

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.899
IS.

01:55:39.966 --> 01:55:42.669
TERRIBLE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:43.970
LOOK AT THE PRIVACY PART THOSE

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:45.338
LEDGER SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.974
JUST ANY AGENCY IT SHOULD BE.

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:49.075
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING AFTER

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:50.877
CRIMINALS [inaudible]

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:53.079
SO YOU.

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:53.613
WE AGREE.

01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.281
BUT I BET IT WOULD BE OF IT

01:55:55.348 --> 01:55:56.015
WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THE

01:55:56.082 --> 01:55:57.984
STATISTICS ON IF YOU'RE TALKING

01:55:58.051 --> 01:55:59.986
ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING PLEASE.

01:56:00.053 --> 01:56:00.853
CERTAINLY DON'T GET FROM HERE TO

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.088
THAT INFORMATION AND WE'LL DO

01:56:02.155 --> 01:56:03.556
SOME MORE RESEARCH ON FOLLOW UP

01:56:03.623 --> 01:56:06.559
WITH SUMMER BAKER ON ON ON OUR

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:07.160
HOME BRITISH ISSUE BROUGHT UP

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:08.194
TODAY.

01:56:08.261 --> 01:56:09.962
IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR JUST I'M

01:56:10.029 --> 01:56:10.697
SORRY.

01:56:10.763 --> 01:56:11.631
IF IT IF IT COULD AND COULD I

01:56:11.698 --> 01:56:12.231
MEAN I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.032
QUESTION AS YOUR AS YOU'RE

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:14.834
LOOKING AT THIS IS THE WHAT

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.135
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT FOR

01:56:16.202 --> 01:56:18.237
WHAT PURPOSE TO OTHER FEDERAL

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:19.405
AGENCIES.

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:20.573
IF WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.675
THAT SEEMS LIKE HOMEWORK.

01:56:22.742 --> 01:56:24.277
THE SPONSORSHIP BICU AND THAT

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.179
THAT SO THAT WE REALLY KNOW WHAT

01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:27.280
WE MIGHT BE IMPAIRING.

01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:29.082
BUT IT COULD BE.

01:56:29.148 --> 01:56:30.616
A VARIETY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:32.318
COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO HUMAN

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:34.087
TRAFFICKING AND IMMIGRATION

01:56:34.153 --> 01:56:35.888
ENFORCEMENT IT COULD BE A

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.423
VARIETY OF FRAUD CRIMES THAT

01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:39.992
THERE'S JUST A LOT AND SO I I

01:56:40.059 --> 01:56:42.261
WOULD ENCOURAGE TO REALLY --

01:56:42.328 --> 01:56:43.363
LOOK AT AND GET A GOOD

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:44.897
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FEDERAL

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:46.466
LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHERWISE USES

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:48.401
IT FOR AND AGAINST IF YOU GET

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:49.602
SURGICAL THANKS FOR INDULGING ME

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:51.871
ON THAT SECOND POINT.

01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:53.239
MR OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:54.507
OTHER DIFFERENT CONCERN WITH THE

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:56.909
BILL THE ENFORCEMENT IN THIS

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:58.478
BILL CREATES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:56:58.544 --> 01:56:59.712
ACTION WHERE.

01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:01.514
SOMEONE WHO IS SUBJECTED TO A

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.815
NON AUTHORIZED BREACH OF THEIR

01:57:02.882 --> 01:57:04.317
INFORMATION.

01:57:04.384 --> 01:57:06.018
THEN CAN BRING A CIVIL ACTION

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:07.487
AGAINST THE AGENCY THAT --

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:10.857
THE EFFECTUALLY THAT THAT BREACH

01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:11.157
[inaudible]

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.658
NOW OTHER.

01:57:12.725 --> 01:57:14.560
CONSUMER PROTECTION BILLS THAT

01:57:14.627 --> 01:57:15.795
WE HAVE PASSED RECENTLY FACT

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:17.330
WHEN WE PASSED EARLIER THAT IN

01:57:17.397 --> 01:57:19.198
THIS HEARING TODAY.

01:57:19.265 --> 01:57:22.168
I HAVE A YOU KNOW I SIMILAR

01:57:22.235 --> 01:57:24.537
SUBJECT MATTER BUT THEY ENTRUST

01:57:24.604 --> 01:57:25.872
ENFORCEMENT TO ATTORNEY

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.306
GENERAL'S CITY ATTORNEYS AND

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:28.541
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:29.909
AND I THINK IN CASES LIKE THIS

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.277
THAT'S A MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:35.148
BECAUSE A DATA BREACH.

01:57:35.214 --> 01:57:37.283
BY AN AGENCY IS LIKELY TO BE NOT

01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:38.751
JUST ONE OR TWO PEOPLE BUT A

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:40.286
WHOLE CLASS OF PEOPLE AND IT

01:57:40.353 --> 01:57:41.254
SEEMED LIKE.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.789
AVOIDING THOSE KIND OF SYSTEMIC

01:57:42.855 --> 01:57:45.124
ABUSES WOULD BE BETTER HANDLED

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.325
BY SOMEONE LIKE ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:57:46.392 --> 01:57:46.592
CAN YOU.

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:48.528
CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU DIDN'T

01:57:48.594 --> 01:57:50.196
GO THAT ROUTE INSTEAD CREATED A

01:57:50.263 --> 01:57:50.830
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THIS

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:57.804
BILL.

01:57:57.870 --> 01:57:59.806
WE THINK THAT BOTH REMEDIES ARE

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:01.774
APPROPRIATE HERE THIS.

01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:05.044
TYPE A DISCLOSURE ONE AND BE A

01:58:05.111 --> 01:58:07.213
DATA BREACH --

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.515
SITUATION IT'S WHEN THE ACTUAL

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:12.018
HOTEL A BUS COMPANY VOLUNTARILY

01:58:12.084 --> 01:58:14.720
TURNS THIS INFORMATION OVER SO.

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:16.656
THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR

01:58:16.722 --> 01:58:19.258
ACTIONS IN THIS LAW PUTS THEM ON

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:20.560
CLEAR NOTICE THAT SUCH

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:23.196
DISCLOSURE IS NOT PERMITTED AND

01:58:23.262 --> 01:58:25.097
SO WE THINK IF THEY WERE. TO

01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:26.599
TAKE THAT AFFIRMATIVE STEP

01:58:26.666 --> 01:58:28.701
DESPITE THAT THAN HAVING THE

01:58:28.768 --> 01:58:29.469
OPTION OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:58:29.535 --> 01:58:31.170
ACTION FOR INDIVIDUALS.

01:58:31.237 --> 01:58:32.238
WHO ARE HARMED BY THIS IS

01:58:32.305 --> 01:58:35.107
APPROPRIATE WHILE STILL ALLOWING?

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:36.209
FOR ALL THE OTHER ENFORCEMENT

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:37.944
MECHANISMS BY DISTRICT

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.312
ATTORNEY'S CITIZENS TOURNEY'S

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:40.680
AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

01:58:40.746 --> 01:58:42.849
DOES THE BILL ACTUALLY ALLOW

01:58:42.915 --> 01:58:43.449
THAT BECAUSE I DON'T READ THAT

01:58:43.516 --> 01:58:46.953
IN THE BILL.

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:48.821
I BELIEVE IT DOES ADAM MCCANN

01:58:48.888 --> 01:58:50.323
LOOK INTO THAT MAKE SURE.

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:51.824
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

01:58:51.891 --> 01:58:52.124
PROHIBITION.

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:55.962
ON AS IN ANY LAWS THAT ARE ON

01:58:56.028 --> 01:58:57.497
THERE AT WHAT READ ANYTHING

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:58.531
ABOUT THAT BUT ULTIMATELY MY

01:58:58.598 --> 01:59:00.132
CONCERN AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:59:00.199 --> 01:59:01.601
WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER AREAS.

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.536
IN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW WHICH

01:59:03.603 --> 01:59:05.071
IS THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN WHAT WE

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:07.073
WERE ON THE SAME TEAM WHERE WE

01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:08.241
WANT TO ENFORCE.

01:59:08.307 --> 01:59:09.976
STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:11.944
WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE PREDATORY

01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:13.312
LAW FIRMS OUT THERE THAT ARE

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:15.181
LOOKING FOR EXCUSES TO INSTITUTE

01:59:15.248 --> 01:59:16.816
CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND HAVE A

01:59:16.883 --> 01:59:18.451
PROFIT MOTIVE THEIR MOTIVE IS

01:59:18.518 --> 01:59:20.019
NOT ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW THERE

01:59:20.086 --> 01:59:20.253
FORCED.

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:21.687
THEIR MOTIVE IS TO MAKE MONEY.

01:59:21.754 --> 01:59:23.556
AND THEY TRY AND PICK UP LITTLE

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:25.258
GOTCHA CASES WHERE THERE BEN ON

01:59:25.324 --> 01:59:27.793
AUTHOR OF PERHAPS UNWITTING

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:28.694
VIOLATIONS OF CONSUMER

01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:30.596
PROTECTION LAW AND AND YOU KNOW

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:32.164
THEY THEY USE THAT TO EXPLOIT.

01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:33.666
THE COMPANIES THAT WERE INVOLVED

01:59:33.733 --> 01:59:36.302
AND A THAT THAT'S NOT AN

01:59:36.369 --> 01:59:37.703
APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENFORCE.

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:40.172
CONSUMER PROTECTION LINE SO I I

01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:41.007
HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSETHE

01:59:41.073 --> 01:59:41.908
BILL.

01:59:41.974 --> 01:59:43.442
TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT AND ONE

01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:44.577
ENCOURAGE YOU IF THERE'S A BILL

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:47.413
MOVES FORWARD HERE TO CONSIDER.

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:49.181
CHANGING THE ENFORCEMENT TO BE.

01:59:49.248 --> 01:59:50.883
GOVERNMENTAL ATTORNEYS GENERAL

01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:52.451
DISTRICT ATTORNEY CITY ATTORNEYS

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:53.085
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A MUCH

01:59:53.152 --> 01:59:54.921
MORE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO BRING

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:08.568
IT'S A IT'S A GOOD MEASURES VERY

02:00:08.634 --> 02:00:11.103
GOOD MEASURE AS ONE OF ADDRESSES.

02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:14.273
SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED AND

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.875
LET ME ENEMY SAY THAT UNDER THE

02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:16.943
FOURTH AMENDMENT ANY LAW

02:00:17.009 --> 02:00:18.978

02:00:19.645 --> 02:00:21.881
ON WHEN THE DEMAND FOR THESE

02:00:21.948 --> 02:00:23.282

A WARRANT --

02:00:24.984 --> 02:00:26.385
I THINK THE BILL ONLY LIMITS

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:29.355
THOUGH THE VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE --

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:30.356
