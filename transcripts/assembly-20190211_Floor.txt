ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINETEEN BY SOME MEMORABLE WEBER AND OTHERS ROSE IT'S A BLACKISH AMOUNT. DOCTOR WEBER YOUR RECOGNIZE AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. ONCE AGAIN I RISE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. AS WE PRESENT ACR NINETEEN IN HONOR OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH. THE STORY OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH ITSELF BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN ABOUT A HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT THAT ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN THE UNITED STATES. IT WAS IN SEPTEMBER THAT A HARVARD TRAINED HISTORIAN. DOCTOR CARTER G. WOODSON. WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF MISS EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO? REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE BECAUSE OF A LACK OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE HISTORY AND CONTRIBUTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. THEREFORE IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AND FEBRUARY. THE FIRST NEGRO HISTORY WEEK TOOK PLACE. FEBRUARY WAS CHOSEN IT INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AS THE SHORTEST MONTH OF THE YEAR. BUT WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AND FREDERICK DOUGLASS. TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY BELIEVED HAD A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN CHANGING THE PROJECT THREE OF THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. OVER THE YEARS BLACK HISTORY MONTH HAS CONTINUED TO GROW AND TO DEVELOP BLACK HISTORY WEEK I SHOULD SAY. AND IT WASN'T UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT WE BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH MORE THAN JUST THE SECOND WEEK OF FEBRUARY. BUT THE ENTIRE MONTH OF FEBRUARY. AND OF COURSE IN THIS HOUSE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY FOUR AYE BY EIGHTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILLIE BROWN. SIGNED INTO THE GOVERNOR'S PROCLAMATION REGARDING MARTIN LUTHER KING'S BIRTHDAY. ONCE AGAIN GIVING CALIFORNIA MORE THAN ONE DAY TO CELEBRATE AND RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WHO WILL BE IN AUGUST. THAT THE FIRST AFRICANS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. THEY LISTED THEM AS TWENTY AN ODD NEGROES. LITTLE BIT MORE THAN. TWENTY THEY WERE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN CAPTURED ON A SHIP. BY THE DUTCH. AN EVENTUALLY SOLD AND TRADED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY WERE. THE FIRST TO COME. AND THEY WERE LISTED AND SOLD AS INVOLUNTARY LABORERS AND INDENTURED SERVANTS. THIS WAS NOT THE BEGINNING OF SLAVERY AS MOST PEOPLE THINK. BECAUSE SHORTLY AFTER THAT TIME THEY HAD CONTRACTS TO SAID THAT THEY WOULD WORK. FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. AND THEN THEY WOULD GAIN THEIR FREEDOM JUST LIKE ALL OTHER INDENTURED SERVANTS DID. AND IT IT WITHIN THREE OR FOUR YEARS SOME OF THEM WERE LISTED AS LAND OWNERS. SO IT'S INCORRECT TO BELIEVE THAT THE FIRSTPERSON WHO CAME HERE WERE SLAVES. THEY WERE NOT THERE WHEN INDENTURED SERVANTS LIKE SO MANY OTHERS. THEY CAME HERE YEAR BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER. WHICH WAS IN. SIXTEEN TWENTY SO YEAR BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER AFRICANS WILL ON THIS CONTINENT. WORKING TO DEVELOP AMERICA AND TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. EVENTUALLY THE SLAVE TRADE DID DEVELOP. AND IT BECAME THE WORST SYSTEM ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. SLAVERY HAD ALWAYS EXISTED IN AMERICA IT ALWAYS EXISTED AROUND THE WORLD. BUT THE KIND OF SLAVERY THAT EXIST IN AMERICA WAS UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN KIND. IT WAS NOT JUST AS SLAVERY FOR LABOR TEMPORARILY IT WAS THE SLAVERY OF THE SOUL. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO NOT ONLY IMPRISONED THEMSELVES BUT FOR GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS TO COME. EVENTUALLY EVERY LAW WAS WRITTEN TO PUT TO PREVENT THEM FROM HAVING ANY RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND TO IT AND AND OFTENTIMES TO LEGALIZE THE BRUTAL BRUTALITY THAT EXISTED. AND OF COURSE THE OWNERSHIP OF INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE SOLD THE COULD BE BREED IT AND THEY COULD BE KILLED WITHOUT IN CONSEQUENCE. DESPITE THAT SOME FIFTY MILLION AFRICANS WITH STOLEN FROM THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA. ONLY FIFTEEN MILLION MADE IT TO THE UNITED STATES. WHICH SPEAKS ABOUT THE BRUTALITY OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE. THE MANY WHO DIED ALONG THE WAY WHO TOOK ILL. THE MINI WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE ALONG THE WAY. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOU HAVE THE RATE BEING OF THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA OF SOME OF ITS STRONG THIS. YOUNGEST INDIVIDUALS. WHICH ALSO WE CAN THE CONTINENT. AND MADE IT SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF COLONIAL ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR AND EVENTUALLY THE TAKING OF MUCH OF THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA INTO COLONIAL RULE. DESPITE ALL OF THAT. AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. CONTINUE TO GROW. TO DEVELOP. TO BE OPTIMISTIC. TO HAVE VISIONS AND DREAMS. AND TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY WHETHER THROUGH THE OFFICE OF PATENTS. OR OTHER PLACES WHERE WE SEE THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE MADE NOT ONLY IN AGRICULTURE. BUT IN SCIENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUMEROUS NUMEROUS INVENTIONS. AND EVEN MORE RECENTLY WE ALL BECAME AWARE. OF THE HUMAN CALCULATORS. AND THE ROLE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN IN IN THE SPACE TRAVEL ITSELF. SO IT IS IMPORTANT AS WE COME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT ACR. NINETEEN THE BLACK CAUCUS RECOGNIZES THE TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE MADE TO CALIFORNIA. IF YOU GO BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE YOU WILL SEE THE HISTORY THAT'S ON THE WALL. OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS MADE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK AND TO MAKE THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS. WITH THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY STOLEN FROM THE COUNTRY. WHAT TO THIS COUNTRY? WORKED WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION. AND THE ONLY ONES THAT HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HAVE BEEN BASICALLY TREATED BRUTALLY. AND NEVER GIVEN REPARATIONS. WHICH THIS CONTINUE TO BE A CHALLENGE THAT'S THE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AYE ASKS THAT YOU JOIN US. WITH AB ACR. NINETEEN AND WE URGE EVERYONE TO CELEBRATE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS NOT ONLY DOING BLACK HISTORY MONTH. BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE THROUGHOUT THE THE LOT THE ENTIRE A YEAR. AND THAT THIS RESOLUTION ENCOURAGES THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT. AND TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE TALENTS THE ACHIEVEMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE MADE TO CALIFORNIA. AND TO THE STATE IN THIS NATION AND THE WORLD FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR. NINETEEN CHAIR RECOGNIZES MISTER MURATSUCHI FROM HIS DESK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. I RISE. TO SUPPORT [inaudible] ACR. NINETEEN TO CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH. YOU KNOW I'M A SUBMIT FOR MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I DID NOT LEARN ENOUGH ABOUT AFTER AMERICAN HISTORY DURING MY CHILDHOOD. IT WAS NOT UNTIL COLLEGE. WHEN? I STARTED TAKING ETHNIC STUDIES CLASSES. THAT I STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT THE COMMONALITIES. AND HISTORIES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN AMERICA. INCLUDING THE HISTORY OF ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. AS A YOUNG COLLEGE MAN I READ THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MALCOLM X.. AND I RECOGNIZE IMMEDIATELY THAT ANGER. AGAINST RACISM BECAUSE IT'S THAT SAME ANGER. THAT I AM PERSONALLY FELT EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN CALLED. A* OR*. AND WHEN I LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ANGER AND AFTER AMERICAN COMMUNITY ABOUT THE LONG TOO LONG HISTORY OF RACISM IN AMERICA AGAINST AFTER AMERICANS. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANGER BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME ANGER THAT JAPANESE AMERICANS. NO. ONE AN ENTIRE RACE IS PROFILED AS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT AND INCARCERATED IN AMERICAN CONCENTRATION CAMPS. AND SO IT IS FROM THIS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF KNOWING THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF KNOWING OUR HISTORY. THAT I RISE IN SUPPORT. TO HONOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] MR LACKEY. YES THANK YOU MEMBERS IT IS CLEARLY AN HONOR TO STAND. IN RECOGNITION OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH. I WOULD LIKE. TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE EXTRAORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS COUNTRY IN OUR SOCIETY. AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING WITH SOME OF THE MOST ADMIRABLE. HARDWORKING AND SELL STOCK SACRIFICING OFFICERS WERE INDEED AFRICAN AMERICAN. I KNOW THAT IT IS THE TRADITION OF COURAGE SELF SACRIFICE AND INNOVATION WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THAT HELPS MAKE OUR SOCIETY STRONG. I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER.

BAYARD RUSTIN WAS A LEADER IN THE SOCIAL MOVEMENTS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS GAY RIGHTS AND NON VIOLENCE HE WAS AN ADVISER TO DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. DURING THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT HE WAS ALSO AN ORGANIZER FOR THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON.

NINETEEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS KAMLAGER-DOVE WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR DS. HANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A C. R.. NINETEEN BLACK WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRAIL BLAZERS. SINCE THIS COUNTRY LANDED ON US. MANY KNOW THE NAMES OF SHIRLEY CHISHOLM THE MASON HARRIET TUBMAN. PIONEERS IN OUR HISTORY WHO RAN FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND WHO WERE BUSINESS MOGULS AND MILLIONAIRES AND WHO ESTABLISHED THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BRINGING SLAVES TO FREEDOM. OTHER NAMES OF BLACK WOMEN I'D LIKE TO SHARE. BESSIE COLEMAN WHO WAS THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE PILOT MAGGIE LINO WALKER WHO WAS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO FORM AND BI PRESIDENT OF A UNITED STATES BANK. AND MERRY CANNER WHO INVENTED THE SANITARY NAPKIN. WHILE WE SHOULD LEARN ABOUT AND CELEBRATE AS MANY BLACK WOMEN AS POSSIBLE WHO HAVE CHARTERED THE COURSE OF HISTORY FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. LET'S NOT FORGET THE CONTINUE CHALLENGES THAT BLACK WOMEN CONTINUE TO FACE EVERY DAY. WE ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN OUR PRISON WE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY IMPLICIT BIAS WE ARE UNDER REPRESENTED IN SENIOR LEADERSHIP ACROSS ALL SECTORS AND WE ARE STILL MARGINALIZED IN PAY EQUITY. IN REPRESENTATION IN ELECTED OFFICE AND WE RECEIVE SIXTY ONE CENTS TO THE WHITE MALE DOLLAR. AND YET WE ARE ALWAYS AND CONTINUED TO ACT WE ARE ALWAYS ASKED TO TOW THE LINE AND CARRY THE WATER ON SO MANY ISSUES AND CAUSES. SO IT IS IN THIS HOUSE. THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THE STRUGGLE AND THE PAIN OF BLACK WOMEN AND AFRICAN AMERICANS DURING THIS MONTH. AND HONOR THAT IN THE POLICY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE ON THE HISTORY ON THE COLOR AND ON THE FUTURE OF THIS STATE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR. NINETY SEEING AND HEARING. NO OTHERS WISHING TO SPEAK DOCTOR WHEREVER YOU MAY CLOSE IN THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. FOR ALL OF THEIR COMMENTS AND THEIR SUPPORT. YOU KNOW I ALSO LIVE IN A WORLD OF WHAT IF. WHAT IF THINGS HAD BEEN DIFFERENT? WHAT WOULD THE WORLD TODAY LOOK LIKE? AND THEN OFTENTIMES I'M REMINDED OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND YET HOW LITTLE WE'VE GAINED. THIS PAST WEEK WE HAVE ALL BEEN REELING OVER WHAT IS HAPPENING IN VIRGINIA. AND THE PEOPLE ASK THE QUESTION WHAT SHOULD WE DO. DEALING WITH BLACK FACE. AND THE KKK UNIFORM OUTFIT. AND I'M OFTEN I HAVE TO REMIND FOLKS THAT NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS WORLD BY ACCIDENT. THE THINGS WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE HAVE A PURPOSE IN THE DESIGN AND WE GET THE RESULTS. OF THAT ACTION. YOU SEE I'M NOT THAT CONCERNED I THINK ABOUT BLACK FACING KKK UNIFORMS IN VIRGINIA. BECAUSE I DEALT WITH THAT AND YOU SEE LA I DEALT WITH THAT ALSO MOST RECENTLY UCSD. WITH THE COMPTON COOK OUT. IN TWENTY IN. TWENTY TEN THAT HAPPENED ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. WELL YOUNG PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY TO MIMICKED AND TO CHARACTERIZE INC AND MAKE CHARACTERS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. I DEALT WITH THAT REGULARLY AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY WHEN WE WOULD HAVE OUR SLAVE AUCTIONS THAT AYE FRATERNITIES. AND PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT WE WERE OVERLY SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES THAT WITH THE AND SO WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I DEALT WITH THAT WHEN WE'VE I PURCHASED MY FIRST HOME IN SAN DIEGO. IN OAK PARK VERY COMMON WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY. ONLY TO GO THROUGH FOR THE DAY OF INSPECTION TO SEE A TO APPROVE THE HOUSE. DISCOVERED IN THE MASTER BEDROOM KKK WAS CARVED INTO THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET. FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM. AND THE ONLY CLAIM HE DIDN'T SEE THAT INITIALLY. SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY CONFRONTED WITH THE REALITY THAT RACISM IS DEEP IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IT HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT ON EVERYTHING. ON HEALTH CARE ONE EDUCATION ON VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES AND THINGS THAT WE MEET EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO JUST TURN OUR EYES AND LOOK AWAY. BECAUSE THE LACK OF EDUCATION IS INTENTIONAL. IT IS FOR THAT LACK OF EDUCATION THE FACT THAT WE WOULD BE HUMANIZED IN THE HISTORY OF AFRICANS WERE TAKEN AWAY. WHEN YOU'LL GO TO EGYPT AND YOU SEE THE HISTORY OF THIS OF CIVILIZATION? DONE BY AFRICANS A NEW CALL INSIDE OF THE TUNES AND YOU SEE. THAT THE COLOR IS STILL THERE BECAUSE OF THE BRILLIANCE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKES THE COLORS. THOUSANDS OF YEARS LATER. AND YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE INDIVIDUALS YET THAT HISTORY IS OFTEN STOLEN. AND HEAR FROM THOSE WHO NEED IT SO MUCH. BUT IT ALSO GIVES THOSE WHO REFUSED TO DO THE HISTORY. THE COMFORT AND THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DE HUMANIZE. TO LIMIT. AND OFTENTIMES TO DESTROY GENERATIONS AND GENERATIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN TERMS OF THEIR SELF ESTEEM. I CALL FOR YOU TODAY BECAUSE NOT TO JUST SIMPLY SAY THIS IS BLACK HISTORY MONTH. BUT TO RECOGNIZE A POLICIES OF THIS HOUSE IN THIS STATE. THAT CONTINUED TO DE HUMANIZE AFRICAN AMERICANS. THE FACT THAT WE CAN SHOOT AFRICAN AMERICANS AND HAVE NO REMORSE. IS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE TO THE HEART. AND THE SPIRIT OF THIS HOUSE. AND THE STATION. THAT WE CAN HAVE THINGS HAPPEN THAT WE WOULD NOT ALLOW HAPPEN ANYWHERE ELSE. AND FEEL NO REMORSE. THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF ACHIEVEMENT IN THE STATE. AND THERE IS NOT OUTRAGE. OUTRAGE FROM THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH THE GREATEST EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE WE ENSLAVED. THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT BILL BUILT THE FIRST LIBRARIES IN THE WORLD. WE WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE THE HIGHEST LITERACY RATE IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS BECAUSE OF THEIR BELIEF IN LITERACY AND READING. BUT THERE ARE THE ONES WHO CREATED SUNDAY SCHOOL SO THEY COULD TEACH THE FORMER SLAVE TO READ. BUT THEY BILL BLACK COLLEGES WHEN WE WOULD NOT ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN TO GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE WHY THEY BELIEVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION. MORE THAN SOMETIMES OF FARMERS AND OTHERS WHO TOOK FOR GRANTED THEIR WHITE STATUS WOULD ALWAYS PROTECT THEM. SO WHEN WE BEGIN TO SAY YES WE BELIEVE IN THE RESOLUTION WE HAVE TO BEGIN THE WORK. AND THAT WORK IS TO CHANGE THE THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE AND THIS NATION. WE CONSISTENTLY PUT TOGETHER PROPOSALS CONCERNING ETHNIC STUDIES AND BLACK HISTORY AND THE CHICANO KISSED HISTORY THAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN THE STATE. AND WE ALWAYS COME UP WITH THE SAME CONCLUSION IT COSTS TOO MUCH. I'VE BEEN TOLD IT IGNORES IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN KNOWLEDGE. THAT IT HAS PROFOUND IMPACT ON OUR LIVES. AND CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO BETTER. IT HAS TO BEGIN TO SAY WE MUST CHANGE HOW WE TEACH HISTORY. AND IT MAY TAKE AWHILE BUT IT IS WORTH DOING. WE HAVE BEEN RAISING THIS ISSUE FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS IN THE STATE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF ETHNIC STUDIES. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE HAD TAKEN ACTION FIFTY YEARS AGO. TO CHANGE HOW WE EDUCATE AT THE UNIVERSITY IT'S HOW WE EDUCATE OUR TEACHERS AND EVENTUALLY WORK DOWN TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY HAVE A CURRICULUM THAT IS A FULL CURRICULUM OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. IN OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM. WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT TIME IS UP? WE HAVE BEEN FACED WITH THE REALITY AS WE LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN VIRGINIA AND ELSEWHERE THAT RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL AND GETTING FAT IN THIS NATION. AND WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO SIMPLY HAVE RESOLUTIONS THAT CALL FOR US TO KNOW OUR HISTORY. WE MUST BEGIN THE ACTION OF MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CHILD KNOWS IT. THAT WE STAND BY IT AND THAT WHEN WE DO THAT WE CHANGE WHO WE ARE. AND WE CHANGE THE FUTURE FOR CHILDREN TO COME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OF ACR. NINETY THAT THE FIRST GOAL IS NOT ONLY OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. BUT FOR THOSE WHO PLAN TO TAKE ACTION IN THE STATE. ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED. WILL MOVE TO THE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. DOCTOR WEBER HAS ASKED A CO AUTHORS ON THIS MEASURE. CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. THE CO AUTHORS. MEMBERS THIS IS THE CO AUTHORS. ONE ACR. NINETY MEMBERS IS THE CO AUTHORS.
