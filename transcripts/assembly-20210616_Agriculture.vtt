DISASTERS IN MY OWN DISTRICT-

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.350
CARE FOR THE ANIMALS AND THE

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.385
CHALLENGE OF PEOPLE NOT WANTING

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:31.721
TO EVACUATE IS SIGNIFICANT-

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:33.990

THINK OF- YES HAS. HAS REGION'S

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:40.730
AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TEAMS.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:41.764
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCOPE OF

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.533
THE FIRES THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:46.169
FOR EXAMPLE- WHEN WE HAD FOUR

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:47.970
FIVE COUNTIES THE SAME TIME

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.373
FIGHTING THE SAME SIMILAR FIRE-

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.141
YEAH I DID AYE AYE WIN TEAM

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:53.409
ISN'T GOING TO DO IT SO I'M

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.944
IDEA SO. SO WHAT ARE YOU

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:55.912
LOOKING AT THE PART OF ME

01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:58.014
EXAMPLE IS LIKE I WORK WITH THE

01:01:58.081 --> 01:01:59.482
CORONER'S OFFICE AND WE'RE PART

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.717
OF A REGION. AND SO THERE'S A

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.252
MUTUAL AID AGREEMENTS DIFFERENT

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:07.090
REGIONS. BASED ON- NEED IS AT

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:07.657
SUCH AS THAT KIND OF WHAT

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:10.226
YOU'RE IN. OR I'D WE AND-

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.161
EDUCATION AND COORDINATION AND

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:14.497
ASSISTANCE- I THINK YOU'RE

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.800
RIGHT THAT- ALTHOUGH IT'S

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:19.402
WORRISOME THAT THE SCALE OF

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.304
WHAT WE FACE IN OUR STATE AS

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:23.072
YOU MENTIONED- COULD

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.707
POTENTIALLY CROSS MANY SO MANY

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:28.077
DIFFERENT AREAS AND- I'M

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:29.178
CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO SOLVE

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.179
THE WHOLE PROBLEM WITH THIS

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.781
BILL AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:32.815
TRYING TO TAKE A- BIG STEP

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.550
FORWARD. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:37.220
TO DO BUT IT IS A AS YOU YOUR

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.888
QUESTION NOTES AT THIS THIS THE

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.056
SCALE AND SCOPE COULD BE VERY

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.892
SIGNIFICANT HERE- BECAUSE OF

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.594
THE DISASTERS THAT YOU HAVE IT.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.963
CUTELY FELT IN YOUR AREA. AND I

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.865
THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GROW THIS

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.567
IN A IN A GOOD WAY BUT IT'S NOT

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:52.768
AS FAST AS MAYBE SOME OF US

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:54.170

HAVE A BUDGET IMPLICATION HERE.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.440
AND I THINK IT'S THREE MILLION

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:58.341
DOLLARS FOR THIS PARTICULAR

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.276
PROGRAM IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:01.177
THE SCALE THAT WE LIKE BUT I

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.612
THINK IT WILL. PROVIDE THE

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.580
PROFESSIONALISM THE EDUCATION
