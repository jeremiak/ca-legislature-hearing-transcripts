ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A QUORUM AND- WE'RE READY TO BEGIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLAME. WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OVER HALF OF ALL RENTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONSIDERED RENT BURDENED MEANING THAT THEY SPEND OVER A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND ARE LESS ABLE TO PAY FOR OTHER ESSENTIALS LIKE HEALTH CARE FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM DIRECTED STATE AGENCIES TO TAKE A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS BY FACILITATING HOUSING PRODUCTION ON STATE OWNED PROPERTIES. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE BUILDS ON THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS BY ESTABLISHING A PILOT PROJECT TO LOOK AT UNDER UTILIZED STATE PROPERTIES THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE BOTH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ESSENTIAL STATE SERVICES THE BILL IDENTIFIES THREE SPECIFIC SITES THAT ARE BOTH OUTDATED AND LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING NAMELY THE DMV FIELD OFFICES IN SANTA MONICA CULVER CITY AND HOLLYWOOD TWO OF THE THREE ARE LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT INCLUDES AN AERIAL VIEW OF THE SITES AND SOME. DATA AS YOU CAN SEE ALL THREE SITES TOTAL MORE THAN SIX ACRES OF LAND A TOTAL OF OVER FOUR FOUR FOOTBALL FIELDS ARE CLOSE TO TRANSIT. AND ARE SURROUNDED BY OTHER COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. THE THREE SITES HAVE NOT HAD ANY MAJOR RENOVATIONS SINCE THEY WERE FIRST CONSTRUCTED. FIFTY OR MORE YEARS AGO. WITH DM VIS RECENT EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR IN PERSON VISITS LARGE UNDER UTILIZED FIELD OFFICES MAY NOT BE MOST EFFECTIVE AT PROVIDING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS. BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT RESTRICT THE DMV IN ANYWAY FROM DETERMINING HOW MUCH SPACE THEY NEED ON EITHER OF THE SITES- ON ANY OF THE SITES- THAT WOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF THE LEAST IT ONE OF THE SUBJECTS OF THE LEASE NEGOTIATIONS. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE SIMPLY pDIRECTS DGS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE MV AND THE RESPECTIVE CITIES TO WORK WITH A HOUSING DEVELOPER TO CONSTRUCT NEW DMV FACILITIES ALONGSIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT THESE SITES. THE STATE DOUG WOULD LEASE THE PARCELS AT ZERO COST TO THE DEVELOPER. IN EXCHANGE THE HOUSING DEVELOPER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW DMV FACILITIES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THE MEASURE ENSURES CUSTOMERS CAN CONTINUE TO ACCESS SERVICES BY REQUIRING DMV TO PROVIDE SERVICES AS THE NEW FACILITIES ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY NINE IS A PILOT PROJECT TO HELP US RETHINK THE WAY WE UTILIZE LIMITED STATE RESOURCES TO TACKLE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. DMV WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE CUSTOMERS AT NEW UPGRADED FACILITIES. THAT ARE PAID FOR BY THE DEVELOPER AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS IS TRULY A WIN WIN FOR THE STATE.

TWO BLOCKS FROM AN ALLEY METRO EXPO LINE TRAIN STATION AND TWO BLOCKS FROM A PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT BY THE REPRESENTS ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLICLY OWNED SITES IN SANTA MONICA THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE BUILDING A NEW DMV FACILITY FACILITY.

ZERO AND CURRENTLY NOT ENGAGED YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR I QUESTIONS FROM NUMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY YEAH I'D I'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WHAT MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE DMV- SERVICES ASPECT THAT I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION I'M HOPING THAT YOU COULD I THINK I HEARD BUT I'M NOT SURE THE ESTIMATION OF HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED. THROUGH THIS PROJECT BUT THE BEST I CAN SAY IS HUNDREDS- PETER- RATHER LARGE SITES- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T- DONE A SITE ASSESSMENT TONIGHT AS FAR AS I KNOW NOBODY'S DONE INSIDE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW MANY UNITS- THAT COULD BE LOCATED- IF THIS DOES NOT WORK FOR THE DEVELOPER- AND DGS. AND THE DMV CARE THEN AT LEAST WILL BE NEGOTIATED- SO- I THINK BUILT INTO THE PROCESS HERE IS SOME SAFETY FOR ALL THE PARTIES. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG. THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM FOR BRING US FORWARD I THINK IT'S A GREAT CONCEPT IN TERMS OF A PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE DAY OF THE STATE'S. BUDGET SUGGESTS ADJOURNMENTS CONCERN FROM THE BUILDING TRADES AS ARE ANY UPDATES OR INFORMATION OF IT IN MY PROVIDE ON THE LABOR PROTECTIONS AND I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE THE- OPPOSITION CAME IN RATHER LATE TO- IN THE- PROCESS BUT- AS INDICATED- WE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE TRAITS AND TO. BEGIN A CONVERSATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION HOPEFULLY- WORK OUT TO- A- A FAVORABLE RESPONSE TO THE OPPOSITION. I KNOW THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LYNN JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FROM AT FOR ME. SO THE ANALYSIS RAISED A COUPLE OF CONCERNS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL REDUCED ACCESS TO DMV SERVICES. I'M AND I THINK SPECIFICALLY THE FACT THAT THAT COULD. I IN FACT IMPACT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES- YOU KNOW MOST SIGNIFICANTLY WHO ARE. UNABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES ONLINE IS EASILY AS HIS SIDE HERE'S SOME OF SOME OF US MIGHT BE ABLE TO- CAN YOU JUST RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND PERHAPS. AT PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH A BIT OF AN UPDATE IN TERMS OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DMV TO. ENSURE THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING FOR INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES- THAT WE- YEAH THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES DON'T HARM THE PUBLIC. SURE FIRST I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT- THIS PROCESS IS NO DIFFERENT OR THE- OF THE ULTIMATE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS HERE IS NO DIFFERENT THAN. ANY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT- THAT A STATE FACILITY WOULD UNDERTAKE. AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON AN ONGOING BASIS EXISTS AND ALTHOUGH CIRCUMSTANCES THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS A- IS A NEW ISSUE IT'S ANTICIPATED. THAT DMV TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY WOULD PROVIDE OFF SITE SERVICES AND- SWING SPACE NOT UNLIKE THE SWING SPACE THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN NOW. AS OUR BUILDING IS- IT IS RECONSTRUCTED- BUT BECAUSE DMB IS IN THE PROCESS THAT I'VE OVERSEEN AND BUDGET SUB THREE- OF MOVING TO A MORE ONLINE AND KIOSK ORIENTED PROVISION OF SERVICES WHICH IS BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC. BETTER FOR THE STATE. OF AS AS AS THEY MOVE INTO THAT NEW ERA IT'S ANTICIPATED THAT SOME OF THE SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED NEARBY- IN THE KIOSK FORMAT SOME OF THEM WOULD BE ONLINE. AND SOME OF THE MAY NEED TO BE LOCATED IN A PHYSICAL FACILITY BUT THIS IS TOLL TOTALLY WITHIN- PER. THEY WILL. WHAT SERVICES ARE NECESSARY I'M QUITE CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD- NOT DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD DIMINISH THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THEY CAN ALSO SINCE THESE THREE. OF PROJECTS ARE NEAR ONE ANOTHER THEY CAN NEGOTIATE THESE LEASES IN A IN A WAY- THAT TO A- ALLOWS FOR. A STAGE CONSTRUCTION THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO AND I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD DO ALL THREE OF THESE FACILITIES AT THE SAME TIME THEY COULD DO ONE AFTER THE OTHER SO THAT- THERE WAS SOME CONTINUITY. IN SERVICES IN THE REGION THEY'RE ALL WITHIN A RELATIVE FEW MILES FROM ONE ANOTHER. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND THEN I THINK THROUGH MY TAKE ON THIS BILL IS THAT HI IT'S ACT IT'S ASKING IF OUR STATE. AGENCIES AND CITY PARTNERS I THINK TO TAKE. FROM THERE MORE CREATIVE AND DYNAMIC APPROACH THAN WE OFTENTIMES SEE FROM HER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUT THAT I THINK CALIFORNIANS I'M- EXPECT TO SEE MORE OF. I'M AND HAVE A REASON TO EXPECT TO SEE MORE OF SO I'M RECOGNIZING THAT IT THINK THIS IS BEING FRAMED AS A PILOT PROJECT I THINK ALSO RECOGNIZING. THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING ON THIS BILL WILL ALSO BE HEARD AND TRANSPORTATION WHICH I DO THINK. GIVES ARE THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TIME TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH AT THE BUILDING TRADES AND I TALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE. LATE OBJECTIONS AND I AND WORK THROUGH TO ENSURE THAT THE SOLUTION INCLUDES LABOR PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL AND YOU KNOW WITH THAT I HOPE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I'M- NOT RECOMMENDING.

WHAT IS READY I DO HAVE A QUESTION I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE HAVE HAD SOME OF THIS CONVERSATION OFFLINE- SO. I AT THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AT SOME TIME AGO. I DIRECTING DGS TO- INVENTORY SURPLUS PROPERTIES AND EVALUATE THEIR SUITABILITY FOR ODD FUTURE- USE AS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. AND I KNEW THAT WHEN WE WERE IN CONVERSATION YOUR VISION FOR THIS BILL IS. MUCH DIFFERENT THAN NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THAT BUT BUILT ON THAT CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO AT THE WAYS IN WHICH YOUR PROPOSAL. I DIFFERS FROM THE EXISTING EXECUTIVE ORDER IN THE WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE BY DGS- AND OTHER WAYS IN WHICH- THE I GUESS THE GAPS THAT YOU SEE THAT STILL NEED TO BE FILLED. YEAH THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I KNOW MISTER GRAY DID A FABULOUS JOB HE KNOWS MY CITY BETTER THAN I DO SHE'S BEEN HERE TWENTY YEARS. REALLY MERCED CASH- BUT AS YOU AS YOU WALK AROUND DOWNTOWN GRAND IT'S BEEN TOUGH FEW DAYS DOWNTOWN HE DOES LACK OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WORK SO THE NATURE OF WORK IS CHANGING AFTER COATED WITH REMOTE WORK AND SO ARE CITY- AND R. MERRITT HER CONCERN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE STATE WORK FORCE. DECREASES SO YES CALIFORNIA'S A LOT OF EFFORTS ALREADY ON SURPLUS STATE LANDS MOST OF THOSE ARE LOW LEVEL VACANT LOTS BABY LOW LEVEL BUILDINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MULTI STORY BUILDINGS HERE DOWNTOWN. NOT SOLD IT MORE DEFECTS DIFF DIFFERENT AND DIFFICULT TO CONVERT TO RESIDENTIAL SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THE CITIZEN HOTEL- CERTAIN MISTER GRAY FIVE MEMBERS TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT WS AN OFFICE BUILDING OR A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE GROUPS HAD THEIR OFFICES ABOUT FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS CONVERTED. TO RESIDENTIAL ALBEIT A HOTEL NOT NOT HOUSING AND SO IT'S A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT AND JUST TURNING OVER LAND TO. DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING IS GOING TO BE SOME EXTRA EFFORTS OF THIS BILL WOULD SPECIFICALLY TASK DGS TO HELP COME UP WITH STRATEGIES. HOW WE CAN FOCUS ON ADAPTIVE REUSE OF THE STATE. ASSETS THEY DON'T BECOME A JUST A DRAG ON OUR CENTRAL CITY AND CORPS OF GOVERNMENT AND SO ABOUT THIS BILL GOES FOR I THINK TO HOUSING- PREPARATIONS- COMMITTEE I WOULD I WOULD YOU WANT TO NARROW IT TO FOCUS ON- THE VERTICAL- SURPLUS STATE ASSETS. TRAFFIC AND AS NOTED THIS THIS IS THE FIRST AT. COMMITTEE WHERE THIS BILL IS BEING HEARD IT IS BEING NINE REFERRED TO HOUSING WHERE I THINK SOME OF. THAT SPECIFICITY IN AND REFINEMENT- YOU CAN CAN BE. INCORPORATED I'M THAT WAS- THAT THE COMMITTEE. JUST FIVE REVIEWED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLAM THIS IS ASKING OUR STATE AGENCIES TO TAKE A MORE CREATIVE AND DYNAMIC APPROACH. TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS WHICH I THINK IS APPROPRIATE AND I THINK. CALIFORNIA EXPECTS THAT WE'RE USING OUR STATE RESOURCES AND ASSETS AND DYNAMIC AND CREATIVE WAYS TO FIVE. SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AFFORDED TO US BY CHANGING TIMES- SO WITH THAT. AB WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YEAH I'D I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EASY ISSUE- YOU COULD GIVE AWAY LAND FREE FOR SOME DEVELOPER TO DO HOUSING AND- IT'S NOT THAT EASY PAY WOULD BE HOUSING BILLS IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME. COOPERATION AND RESOURCES THE GOVERNOR IN THE BUDGET HAS PUT- I THINK TO POTS OF FIFTY MILLION. IN THE BUDGET TO LOOK AT THIS BUT IT DAVID REYNOLDS NEED OTHER STRATEGIES DYNAMIC STRATEGIES AS YOU SAY. AND SO- THIS IS AN EFFORT TO CERTAINLY ADDRESS THAT AND THANK YOU ASPERA.
