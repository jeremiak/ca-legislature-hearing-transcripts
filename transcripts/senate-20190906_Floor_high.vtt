00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.069
THE LIST OF CITIES THAT OPPOSE

00:18:57.135 --> 00:18:58.737
THE BILL IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.839
LETTERS AND YOU SEE WHAT IT IS

00:19:00.906 --> 00:19:01.907
THAT THEY WERE OPPOSING THEY

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.343
WERE OPPOSING EITHER THE FACT.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:05.410
THAT THERE WAS LIFTING OF

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.946

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:18.223
ARE NO LONGER THERE AND THE

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.791
CITIES THAT HAVE CAREFULLY RE

00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:21.660
LOOKED AT THE BILL THAT IS

00:19:21.727 --> 00:19:24.062
BEFORE YOU. THEY WILL SEE THAT

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:26.198
WHAT THEY HAD OBJECTED TO IS NO

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:28.166
LONGER IN THE BILL AND I THINK

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:29.434
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS YOU

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:32.237

ADMITTED THAT YES IT NO LONGER

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:48.253
HAS THE THINGS THAT WE WERE

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.689

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:54.393
