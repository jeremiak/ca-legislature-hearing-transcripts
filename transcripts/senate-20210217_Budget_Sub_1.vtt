THAT MIGHT BE GOOD CANDIDATES

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.309

BY PAYING DOWN SO MUCH OF THE

DEFERRALS ARE BUT COULD GO EVEN

00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:23.823
FURTHER AND PAY OFF EVEN MORE

BUDGET TOOLS TO RESPOND TO

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.109

THIS HEARING- WE DO IDENTIFY

SOME LOWER PRIORITY PROPOSALS

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:50.483
AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THEY

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.084
COULD BE USED INSTEAD TO PAY

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.619
DOWN MORE REFERRALS OR HELP

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.821
DISTRICTS. IN OTHER WAYS SUCH

00:10:55.888 --> 00:11:01.127
AS BY MITIGATING FUTURE.

PENSION COST INCREASES. SEVEN

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.264
OTHER TOPIC IN ISSUE ONE CAN-

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.001
IN ROME IN A ROW GROWTH. THE

00:11:09.068 --> 00:11:09.735
PANDEMIC IN THE RECESSION HAVE

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.570
REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY-

00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:14.673
ENROLLMENT DEMAND OF THIS YEAR.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.142
IN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WILL

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.010
HAVE A MUCH CLEARER IDEA ON

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:20.279
ROMAN WHERE ENROLLMENT MIGHT GO

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:22.581
INTO ONE TWENTY TWO YEAH

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.350
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY

00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.452
ENROLLMENT DEMAND IS DOWN THE

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.255
STUDENTS NOT WANTING TO TAKE

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:32.124
ONLINE ONLY COURSES. CERTAIN

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.325
COURSES ARE NOT OFFER BECAUSE

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:34.560
THEY DON'T CONVERT WELL TO AN

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:37.129
ONLINE ENVIRONMENT STUDENTS- A

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.497
LOT OF TIMES SPECIALLY ROLLER

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.666
HAVE LIVED TAX. TO ONLINE

00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:42.768
CLASSES- IT MIGHT NOT HAVE A

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.136
QUIET PLACE TO TAKE THEIR

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:46.205
CLASSES ARE TO STUDY OUR HAVE

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.307
CHILD RESPONSIBILITIES AND

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.242
THEIR THEIR KIDS OR OTHER

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:51.677
OTHERS ARE HAVING TO TAKE CARE

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:54.146
OF OUR ARE. AT HOME RATHER THAN

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.748
IN THEIR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS.

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:58.384
ANOTHER BIG REASON IS OUR

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.019
INDIVIDUALS AND FLOSSER JOBS

00:12:00.086 --> 00:12:02.721
ARE LOOKING FOR JOBS- THEIR

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:05.057
FAMILY INCOME HAS DECLINED AND

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.259
SO THEY NEED TO WORK RIGHT NOW

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:08.894
RATHER THAN I TAKE TIME TO GO

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:10.763
TO SCHOOL. SO DISTRICTS ARE

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.531
HOPEFUL ALL RIGHT NOW THAT THEY

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.366
CAN OFFER A LOT MORE IN PERSON

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.669

IMPACT ON THE DISTRICTS AND

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.483
HAVING TO BORROW INTERNALLY OR

00:23:46.658 --> 00:23:49.561
MENTIONED WE HAVE SEEN A RANGE

00:23:49.628 --> 00:23:52.063
ACROSSTHE STATE WITH SOME

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.666
COLLEGES HOLDING AT ABOUT HALF

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:56.668
A PERCENT DECLINE TO SOME AS

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.236
MANY IN THE DOUBLE DIGIT

00:23:58.303 --> 00:24:01.807
PERCENTAGE. AND MOST STARK IS

00:24:01.873 --> 00:24:03.108
WHAT WE'VE SEEN AGAIN ARE

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:04.810
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS OF

00:24:04.876 --> 00:24:07.379
COLOR WHY AGAIN YOU SEE OUR

00:24:07.445 --> 00:24:08.880
STRONG SUPPORT OF EFFORTS THAT

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:11.349
PUT STUDENTS FIRST RECOGNIZING

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.451
THAT THERE'S CLEARLY ENOUGH

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:15.654
FACT HAPPENING ON STUDENTS AND

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.556
THEIR ABILITY TO STAY ENGAGED

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:19.624
IN OUR COLLEGES. AND WHATEVER

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:21.726
WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THEM IN

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.628
THEIR JOURNEY OR AND RETURNING

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:27.232
BACK TO OUR CAMPUSES IS KEY- AS

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.701
WE BEGAN TO FURTHER ANALYZE

00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:31.670
WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE WANT TO

00:24:31.736 --> 00:24:34.306
LEARN ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:36.474
THESE PARTICULAR STUDENTS ARE

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:38.143
AGAIN MANY OF THE EARLY

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.945
PRESUMPTIONS ARE THESE ARE

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:43.215
WORKING LEARNERS- KAREN'S AND

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:45.083
THOSE THAT WERE ALREADY ON THE

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.186
CUSP OF POVERTY. AND ANY

00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:50.522
EMERGENCY CAN PUT THE STUDENTS

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.090
IN OUR STUDENTS OVER THE ADS

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:55.360
SO- SOME OF THE KIND OF EARLY

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.162
FINDINGS THAT WE ARE SEEING

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:59.631
THANK YOU. ARM I HAVE A BRIEF

00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.466
COMMENT AND NON I WANNA DIRECT

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:03.602
QUESTIONS TO FINANCE AND H. R.

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:05.370
WAS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:25:05.437 --> 00:25:06.671
BOARD FOR EIGHT YEARS BEFORE

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:08.607
SELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY. AND

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:11.142
IN MY HOME DISTRICT THE

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:12.744
ENROLLMENT IS DOWN EIGHTEEN

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:16.014
PERCENT. AND I DID ASSUME WITH

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:17.549
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE LOS

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:19.251
ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.785
SYSTEM AND HE TOLD ME THAT IN

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:29.027
ROME. WAS DOWN 10% ARE WE GAS.

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:30.295
ONE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE

JUST SO. SOME ARE DOWN A HALF

00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.799
OF. THAT IS REALLY THE- BUT I

00:25:34.866 --> 00:25:35.967
THINK WE GONNA FONG A SOMETHING

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.269
THAT'S MORE TOWARD THE- AND

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:40.405
MIKE FOR. IS IF ENROLLMENT IS

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:43.208
DOWN AND MAYBE BY LET'S JUST

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:45.277
PICK A NUMBER AVERAGE BY 10%

00:25:45.343 --> 00:25:47.712
ACROSS THE STATE. OF WHY DID

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.347
YOU RECOMMEND FUNDING FOR

00:25:49.414 --> 00:25:53.518
ENROLLMENT GROWTH. HOW DO THOSE

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:56.721
TWO THINGS FIT TOGETHER. DAN

00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:59.424
OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.059
THIS IS REALLY MORE OF A

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:02.694
TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT THAN IT

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:07.465
IS- UP. IT IS MORE BATES ON.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.733
THREE IT'S GROWTH THAT HAS

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.768
ALREADY HAPPENED SO THIS IS

00:26:09.834 --> 00:26:11.236
REFLECTING THE FACT THAT S. T.

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:14.606
E. R. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:16.408
TWENTY WAS ABOVE THE LEVEL THAT

00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:19.311
WE HAD PREVIOUSLY- ESTIMATED OR

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:21.446
OR I HAD COME AND WILL BE PUT

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:22.914
IN FOR THE TOTAL COMPUTATIONAL

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.351
REVENUE FOR THAT YEAR. SO AND

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:28.219
IT'S BASED ON THAT THAT THREE

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.487
YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE ABOUT THAT

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:31.323
FTS AND MOVE FORWARD IN THE

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.892
FORMULA AND HOW IT AFFECTS- ALL

00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:38.196
THREE ARE- SO AGAIN I THINK WE

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.432
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ARE.

00:26:40.498 --> 00:26:43.768
GENERAL THE QUAN ARE NOT GO TO

00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:46.838
WHAT WE AS WELL DISASTER. ON

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.940
THE ENDING LEVEL OF TWO

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:51.443
NINETEEN F. E. R. BASED ON

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:54.980
ABOUT WHAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY.

00:26:55.046 --> 00:26:57.115

TO MOVE INTO A WRONG GROWTH.

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:42.894

DECLINED. WE'RE SEEING A THE-

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:37.802
INSIDE AT THREE POINT IN THAT

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:41.139
YOU OFFICE DETERMINED THERE'S

MAY TAKE THE MORE OF IT I THINK

00:30:56.788 --> 00:30:57.455
ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE

00:30:57.522 --> 00:30:59.490
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THEY

ROAMING GROWTH AND PLUG IT INTO

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.229

FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:30.388
MENTIONED OUR ENROLLMENT UNDER

00:31:30.455 --> 00:31:32.090
THIS NEW FORMULA IS IN MANY

00:31:32.156 --> 00:31:34.926
WAYS A MISNOMER BECAUSE IT

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:37.495
COLLEGE CAN ESSENTIALLY THOSE

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:40.431
RESOURCES CAN BE USED TO PAY A

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:42.233
COLLEGE FOR ANY GROWTH AND

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.202
AGAIN AS I MENTIONED- THEIR

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:45.436
ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:47.472

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:50.708
ALLOCATION OR THEIR INCREASES

00:31:50.775 --> 00:31:54.679
OUR GROWTH AND SUCCESSES- AND-

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.547
TO PORTIONS OF OUR FORMULA

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.116
AREN'T BASED ON THREE YEAR

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.385
AVERAGES. AND SO THAT MEANS

00:32:00.451 --> 00:32:01.886
THAT AS WE'RE CALCULATING THIS

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:04.122
IS BUILDING FORWARD AND WE'RE

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:06.291

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:09.827
SUCCESSES OF OUR COLLEGES TO

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:10.828
AREAS WHERE COLLEGES HAVE DONE

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:13.598
WELL THEY'VE DONE MUCH MORE TO

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.500
BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT ENROLLING

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:16.601
IN CONNECTING STUDENTS TO

00:32:16.668 --> 00:32:18.903
FINANCIAL AID SO WE ANTICIPATE

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.172
THAT MOVING FORWARD GIVEN THE

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:23.308
URGENCY AROUND MAKING EIGHT

PROPOSING. SOME ONGOING

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:43.781
PROPOSALS AND PERHAPS REPURPOSE

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.816
THAT TOWARD A HIGHER CALLISTO

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:47.251
LEGISLATURE HAS ALL SORTS OF

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:52.556
OPTIONS ERE TO DISCUSS. AND

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.725

GOING TO KEEP GOING TO ALL THE

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.795
IS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE OTHER

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.230
ISSUES THAT TIES TO THIS IS THE

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:02.800
FOR STATE. AND WHEN THE- OF

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:05.169
FEDERAL STIMULUS CAME AND FOR

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.304
K. THROUGH TWELVE. R. IT WAS

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.473
NOT OFFSET IN ANY WAY IT WAS

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.575
JUST VIEWED AS COMPLEMENTARY TO

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:12.376
WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.612
BUDGET WHEN THE STIMULUS CAME

00:40:14.678 --> 00:40:18.382
IN. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:21.519
HIGHER EDUCATION. THEY WERE NOT

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:22.686
BROUGHT BACK TO THE LEVEL. THAT

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.155
THEY WERE BEFORE IN THE

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:25.389
STATEMENT WAS MADE IN THE

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.724
OVERALL BUDGET HEARING THAT THE

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:28.993
STIMULUS WOULD MAKE UP THE

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.995
DIFFERENCE SO AS WE HAVE JUST

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:32.797
BEEN TALKING IT DOESN'T GO BACK

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:33.831
ON THEIR BASE WITH THE

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:36.767
DEFERRALS ARE PAID OFF. BUT THE

00:40:36.834 --> 00:40:39.603
STIMULUS IS VIEWED AS THE THING

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.273
THAT OUR COURT WILL RELIEVE

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.622
UNFORTUNATELY I KNOW HOW

00:48:45.689 --> 00:48:49.059
FINANCED. AND IF YOU FIXED IT

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:51.962
FOR THE OUT YEARS YOU WOULD-

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.797
ADD A LITTLE TO THE BASE AND

00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:55.232
HAD A LITTLE TO THE HOUSE HERE

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:57.134
DEFICIT AND IT'S EASY TO JUST

00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.368
DO THIS YEAR BY YEAR AND NOT

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.604
GET TO PROJECTING A DEFICIT BUT

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:01.838
IT APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:03.140
THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE AT SOME

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.808
POINT. SO IT SHOULD JUST BE

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.711
DONE IT IN MY TECH- BEFORE I

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:09.279
MOVED TO MY LAST QUESTION DOES

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:12.849
THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENT

00:49:12.916 --> 00:49:18.755
ON THIS. YEAH ALL COMMENTS ON

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:24.361
THE ON THE FORMULA ITSELF- THE

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.996
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.664
THAT YOU KNOW IT HAS THREE

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:29.299
COMPONENTS ENROLLMENT AND

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.268
ENROLLMENT WAS WAS THE MAIN

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:33.103
FEATURE OF THE OLD FORMULA BUT

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.706
THE NEW FORMULA ADDS TO

00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:37.941
ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS. AND IF

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.777
IT DOES THOSE COMPONENTS- TEND

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:44.481
TO FAVOR CERTAIN DISTRICTS- ONE

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.216
OF THE COMPONENTS IS A

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:47.884
SUPPLEMENTAL FACTOR FOR.

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.986
DISTRICTS SERVING HIGH HIGHER

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.488
NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:53.390
IDENTIFIED AS AS FINANCIALLY

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:56.593
NEEDY AND THE OTHER IS- IS

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.161
BASED ON OUTCOMES STUDENT

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:00.297
SUCCESS OUTCOMES SO DISTRICTS

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.032
THAT ARE SERVING RELATIVELY

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:05.068
HIGHER INCOME STUDENTS. DON'T

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:07.304
DO AS WELL- AND THEN DISTRICTS

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:09.606
OR SERVING RELATIVELY YOU KNOW

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:10.540
HIGHER AMOUNTS OF LOWER INCOME

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:12.909
STUDENTS AND YOU ALSO HAVE-

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.644
BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS

00:50:14.711 --> 00:50:16.947
COMPONENT A CERTAIN DISTRICTS

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:19.483
ARE CAN TO SERVE OLDER STUDENTS

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:20.684
STUDENTS THAT MIGHT NOT BE

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:23.820
THERE ARE TO TRANSFER OR GET

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:25.655
SOME SKILLS CERTIFICATE THEY

00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:26.556
MIGHT BE THERE FOR OTHER

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:28.425
REASONS OF THOSE DISTRICTS-

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.927
DON'T DO AS WELL- DIDN'T TEND

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:34.631
TO DO AS WELL. UNDER THE NEW

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:35.932
FORMULA SO. DEPARTMENT FOR DID

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.134
MENTION THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.969
RUNS FOR ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS I

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.036
THINK IT'S SCHEDULED TO RUN

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:43.140
THROUGH TWO THOUSAND TWENTY

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:43.740
THREE TWENTY FOUR AND- THAT'S

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.275
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:47.010
WILL WANT TO YOU KNOW CONTINUES

00:50:47.077 --> 00:50:48.311
TAKE A LOOK AT AS IT SHOULD.

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:50.514
WITH ANY FORMULA IS WHETHER THE

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:52.983
FORMULA IS DOING WHAT IT SHOULD

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:55.585
DO ACHIEVING ITS OUTCOMES AND-

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:58.655
AND NOT KIND OF NECESSARILY

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:02.426
PENALIZING DISTRICTS- FOR

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:03.026
CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MIGHT BE

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:04.828
UNDER CONTROL MIGHT NOT BE

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:07.030
UNDER THEIR CONTROL. TAKING

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:09.466
INTO ACCOUNT HOWEVER- YOU KNOW

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.334
COSTS AND WHAT IT COSTS TO

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.069
REALLY STIR SERVICE STUDENT

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:16.206
CREATE INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:17.874
TO SERVE STUDENTS BETTER. THANK

00:51:17.941 --> 00:51:19.342
YOU AND I ONE LAST QUESTION A

00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:22.779
MASCOT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.614
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN. IT

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:28.452
MIGHT SEEM ESOTERIC. BUT IN

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:29.085
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THERE WAS

00:51:29.152 --> 00:51:32.122
A LAW THAT SET THE GOAL OF 75%

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.925
FULL TIME FACULTY AND 25% PART

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.526
TIME FACULTY WITHIN THE

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:39.729
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND

00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:42.933
THIS WAS DONE- BECAUSE OF A FOR

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:45.569
A NUMBER OF BELIEFS BUT ALAS ED

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:50.774
JUNKS AND MORE PERMANENT. IN

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:54.077
TERMS OF THE- WORKFORCE IN N.

00:51:54.144 --> 00:51:56.847
SO IT SEEMS THAT IN THE THIRTY

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:58.615
TWO YEARS SINCE THAT BILL WAS

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:01.818
ENACTED IT IT MOVES UP MOVES

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:04.020
DOWN MOVES UP MOVES DOWN THAT

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:06.756
GOAL IS NEVER BEEN REACHED IT'S

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.058
BEEN THIRTY TWO YEARS. DOES THE

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.726
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAVE ANY

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.862
ACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES TO

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:15.899
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. YOU CENTER

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:18.768
LAND FOR THAT QUESTION- THERE

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:20.270
IT WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:22.005
IS THE FACULTY OBLIGATION

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:23.740
NUMBER THE FACULTY OBLIGATION

00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:25.575
NUMBER SET IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.209
EIGHT AS YOU MENTIONED

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:28.245
ESSENTIALLY TOOK A POINT IN

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:31.448
TIME. AND SAID THAT ANY

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:34.150
DISTRICT ARE COULD NOT FALL

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:36.119
BELOW THEIR CURRENT FACULTY

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:39.322
LEVELS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:39.956
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEN

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:41.091
IT BUILDS UP FROM THERE

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.460
ALLOWING FOR ADJUSTMENTS- WHEN

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:45.629
IT DISTRICT- IS SERVING FAR

00:52:45.695 --> 00:52:48.231
FEWER STUDENTS OR WHEN THERE

00:52:48.298 --> 00:52:51.167
ARE DEFICITS WITHIN- ARE STATES

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:52.435
BUDGETS AS WE'VE SEEN DURING

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:53.937
THE GREAT RECESSION AND IN

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.940
OTHER PERIODS. AND SO- FOR A

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.575
FEW YEARS THE CHANCELLOR'S

STATE AND THESE ARE COMMITMENTS

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.909
AND ENDS IN EMPLOYEES. OF OUR

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:35.011
COLLEGES THAT CAN'T BE FUNDED

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:37.314
ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND SO ANY

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.650
REFORMS REALLY DO LOOK AT. LONG

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:43.620

CONTROL I'M GETTING PRESSURED

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.291
TO INTRODUCE A BILL ON THIS

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:50.327
BECAUSE IT'S JUST BEEN GOING ON

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:52.495
FOR SO LONG. AND I'M OPEN TO

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:53.997
DOING IT BUT I DON'T WANT TO

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:56.099
REARRANGE THE DECK CHAIRS I

00:53:56.166 --> 00:54:00.236
WOULD. LIKE TO HAVE A SENSE.

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:01.838
THAT THERE'S A PER TO GO AND

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:05.342
MANAGE A PLACE. OR METHOD WHICH

00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:07.177
WE MIGHT MAKE SOME PROGRESS ON

00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:09.212
SO I WOULD HOPE TO WORK WITH

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:10.547

BECAUSE I WANTED TO WALK THEM

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.119
THROUGH EVERY SINGLE MAJOR

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:17.921
ISSUE THAT I THOUGHT EXISTED

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:20.957
AND- I KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:21.958
FIVE OTHER ISSUES AND WE HAVE

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.727
TO MOVE ON BUT I WANT TO GIVE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:25.996
YOU. THE CHANCE TO ASK ANY

00:54:26.062 --> 00:54:30.533
QUESTIONS THAT DIDN'T GET PAST.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.102

THINK YOU'VE COVERED MOST OF

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:36.373
THE ISSUES VERY

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:38.842
COMPREHENSIVELY- I JUST WANT TO

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:41.411
STEP BACK IN EMPHASIZE THAT.

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.079
YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:44.514
RIGHT NOW ARE REELING WITH

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.583
DECLINING ENROLLMENT- MY

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.218
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY HAVE

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.854
ACROSS THE SYSTEM. LAID OFF A

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:52.255
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PART TIME

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.424
FACULTY THEY BORROWED FROM THE

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:57.927
RESERVES- IN AND- THE I WANT TO

00:54:57.994 --> 00:54:59.729
ECHO CHAIRMAN LEONARD'S POINT

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.665
THAT. YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE

00:55:01.731 --> 00:55:05.635
CALL- WEATHERS THE PARTIAL

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:06.436
REPAYMENT OF THE DEFERRALS. WE

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:08.338
ARE VERY CLEARLY IN THE

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.906
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CLEARLY DE

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.008
EMPHASIZES COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:13.943
VIS A VIS K. THROUGH TWELVE-

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.045
AND THAT DIFFERENCE IS

00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:17.414
STRIKING. AND IT DOES NOT SEEM

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:19.315
FISCALLY PRUDENT TO BE

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.316
DEPRIVING THE COMMUNITY

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:21.951
COLLEGES WHETHER IT'S THE CALL-

00:55:22.018 --> 00:55:24.220
WHETHER IT'S THE REFERRALS- IN

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:25.321
SO I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:27.190
ABOUT HOW THIS IS LAID OUT- BUT

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:29.059
I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.360
THIS CONVERSATION. GIVE VERY

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:32.062
MUCH IN IT AND I WOULD JUST

CLOSE AS WELL BY SAYING. WE

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.632
LAID OUT LOTS OF ISSUES THAT WE

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:37.100
JUST HOPE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:40.770
THE MAY REVISE. OF AN AND NOW

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:41.371
ALL ACTION TRYING TO MOVE THE

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:44.140

THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FIRST

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:01.991
AND FOREMOST A STUDENT FOCUSED

BUDGET- THE ADMINISTRATION

YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:34.417
MUCH. DELEO THE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.953
ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON BASIC

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.955
NEEDS INCLUDING FOOD HOUSING

00:57:39.022 --> 00:57:41.825
MENTAL HEALTH. WE FIVE IS

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:45.461
LAUDABLE- BASIC NEEDS- WERE

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:47.764
PROBLEM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.999
IT'S JUST GOTTEN WORSE SINCE

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:54.237
THE PANDEMIC IT OF. THIS OF THE

00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:57.173
STATE- SO TO DATE THE STATE'S

00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.576
APPROACH TO ADDRESSING BASIC

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:02.445
NEEDS REALLY IS BEEN PIECEMEAL

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:05.148
LACKING AN OVERARCHING GOALS

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:07.183
AND STRATEGIES IS NOT A LOT OF

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.851
ONE TIME MONEY ONE TIME

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:10.220
INITIATIVES FOR MENTAL HEALTH

00:58:10.286 --> 00:58:12.522
AND FOOD PANTRIES AND THAT SORT

00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:14.224
OF THING OVER THE YEARS. SO

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.592
ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:19.762
COMMENDED FOR HIS FOCUS- HE

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.965
CONTINUES THE STATE'S

00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:23.600
UNCOORDINATED AND REALLY

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:26.970
PIECEMEAL- APPROACH TO

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:29.038
ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM. FOR

00:58:29.105 --> 00:58:30.740
EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.676
DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW PROPOSALS

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:35.812
HOW PROPOSED NEW PROGRAMS WOULD

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:38.514
INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER OR HOW

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:39.749
THEY'D INTERACT WITH EXISTING

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:42.352
PROGRAMS SO COULD POTENTIALLY

00:58:42.418 --> 00:58:45.255
CREATE MORE SILOS. ON THE

00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:47.223
GOVERNOR ALSO PROVIDES ONE TIME

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.993
FUNDS FOR A PURPOSE FOOD PANTRY

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:52.095
AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.930
THAT REALLY REQUIRES SOME

00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:56.933
ONGOING FUNDING TO BE

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.867
SUSTAINABLE. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:57.934 --> 00:59:00.103
PROVIDES FUNDS WITHOUT ANY

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:02.472
EXPECTATIONS IN THE EXPECTATION

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:05.541
OF LEVELS OF SERVICE OR DESIRED

00:59:05.608 --> 00:59:09.245
OUTCOMES WHICH WE SEE AS A KIND

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:11.247
OF FLAW IN THE PROPOSAL. WE

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.715
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:59:12.782 --> 00:59:14.250
CONSIDER A DIFFERENT APPROACH

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.986
AND BY CREATING OF BASIC NEEDS

00:59:17.053 --> 00:59:19.222
BLOCK GRANT UNDER SUCH AN

00:59:19.289 --> 00:59:21.224
APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:23.159
USE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE

00:59:23.226 --> 00:59:25.361
PROPOSED FUNDS FOR MENTAL

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:26.829
HEALTH TECHNOLOGY FOOD AND

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.098
HOUSING AND THEN INTEGRATE

00:59:29.165 --> 00:59:31.968
EXISTING ONGOING FUNDING. OF

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:34.504
FOUR FROM THE- CURRENT- HOUSING

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.739
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT THE

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:38.708
LEGISLATURE FINDS. AND ALONG

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:39.709
WITH THIS APPROACH THE

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:41.444
LEGISLATURE COULD BE CLEAR

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.579
ABOUT EXPECTATIONS ABOUT

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:45.748
MINIMUM SERVICE LEVELS ABOUT

00:59:45.815 --> 00:59:47.684
DESIRED OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.218
BUT THEN GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.254
COLLEGES TO DECIDE HOW TO

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.222
STRUCTURE THE PROGRAM AND USE

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:57.327
THE FUNDING. TO MEET THE NEEDS

00:59:57.393 --> 00:59:59.762
OF THEIR STUDENTS- AND- A BIG

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:00.730
PART OF THAT IS YOU HAVE THE

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:02.699
EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THIS MONEY

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:04.901
IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR- BUT THE

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.069
DISTRICTS NEED TO REPORT

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:08.204
REGULARLY ON THEIR SERVICE

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.706
LEVELS SUCH AS APPOINTMENT WAIT

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:12.008
TIMES. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:14.243
SERVED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.778
WHO FIND HOUSING WHO WERE IN

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.580
DANGER OF BEING HOMELESS THE

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.382
NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLING IN

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.050
THE STATE'S. FOOD STAMPS

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:23.720
PROGRAM CALFRESH AND OTHER

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.222
MEASURES. SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.857
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE

01:00:27.924 --> 01:00:30.193
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. REALLY

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.762
REDUCE THOSE SILOS AND KIND OF

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:33.963
BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.698
EXPECTATIONS ARE ON THE

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:37.600
EMERGENCY FINANCIAL AID GRANTS

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.469
SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT A BIT

01:00:39.535 --> 01:00:42.572
IN THE- IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:44.140
THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT OF

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.541
COURSE NO ABOUT THE SECOND

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:46.876
ROUND OF FUNDING FROM THE

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.277
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:49.245
DEVELOPING THE GOVERNOR'S

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.247
BUDGET NOW WE KNOW THAT AT

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.849
LEAST TWO HUNDRED NINETY

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:53.750
MILLION DOLLARS OF DISTRICTS

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:56.085
KNEW. FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS MUST

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.420
BE PASSED THROUGH STUDENTS AS A

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.155
PURCHASING GRANTS SO WE

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:00.623
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.225
EVALUATE WHETHER WOULD LIKE TO

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.961
ADD IN THE STORY USING STATE

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.095
MONEY. TO HELP WITH THIS

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.598
DECISION MAKING A LEGISLATURE

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:09.332
COULD DIRECT THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:12.435
OFFICE TO. A SURVEY COLLEGES ON

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.470
THEIR PLANS FOR USING THE

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:15.938
UPCOMING FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:17.707
THE FUNDS ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.809
OR ARE RECEIVING NOW. COLLEGES

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:21.611
COULD BE ASKED- HOW MUCH IN

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.012
FEDERAL FUNDS THEY INTEND TO

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:24.647
PROVIDE AS EMERGENCY STUDENT

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:25.648
AID THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.617
LIKELY TO RECEIVE THE STATE AND

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:29.318
HOW MUCH ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE

01:01:29.385 --> 01:01:31.287
ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE. THIS

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.555
INFORMATION LEGISLATURE WOULD

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.424
BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO MAKE

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.792
A DECISION ON WHETHER TO

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.927
PROVIDE STATE FUNDED EMERGENCY

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.096
STUDENT A GRASS ON TOP OF THE

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.865
FEDERAL EMERGENCY. AID GRANTS.

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.268
FOR EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:47.170
COULD DECIDE TO ADD TO THE

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.771
FEDERAL MOUNT THIS IS MAYBE-

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:51.407
SUMMER TERM ASSISTANCE OR

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.176
DECIDED THAT FEDERAL EMERGENCY

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:55.745
GRANTS ARE SUFFICIENT SO SIZE.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.448
AND INSTEAD REPURPOSE THE MONEY

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.883
FOR OTHER PRIORITIES. SUCH AS

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:05.388
ADDRESSING THE DEFERRED. A

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:05.988

ABOUT. WITH TO RETENTION AND

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.158
ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES PROPOSAL

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:11.794

GOVERNOR'S ENROLLMENT- PROPOSAL

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:20.036
WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:22.138
HOLD OFF ON APPROVING THEM THE

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.340
FUNDING UNTIL THE STATE HAS A

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:25.541
CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:27.910
UPCOMING YEAR WILL. LOOK LIKE

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:28.945
IF THERE ARE SIGNS THAT

01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.214
COLLEGES WILL RE OPEN THE FUNDS

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.716
COULD BE PUT TO GOOD USE SO

01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:34.984
THAT COLLEGES CAN GET THE WORD

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.986
OUT TO RESIDENTS THAT THAT THE

01:02:37.053 --> 01:02:39.889
RE OPENING- BUT OTHERWISE IF

TWENTY TWO IT'S UNCLEAR HOW OUT

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.600
OF REACH MONEY WOULD HELP

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.502
BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING REASONS.

WHY INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO

LESS FOR MASS MY COLLEAGUES

01:22:29.377 --> 01:22:32.681
FIRST IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:34.549
NONE FROM CHOMBO. NO I JUST

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.484
WANTED AMEND THAT BRIEFLY. TIED

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:40.088

BRING THAT WORD UP AGAIN BUT

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:46.227
BUT HOW WE TEACH- I THINK THE

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:47.762
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.030
REASONABLE AS AN IS NEVER IT

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.665
JUST STATED IT PROVIDES

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:53.201
IMPORTANT. ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.303
AND RESOURCES FROM MY LEARNING-

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:56.471
I THE ONE POINT I JUST WANT TO

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.039
EMPHASIZE IS THAT WE'RE IN A

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:58.606
KIND OF A UNIQUE TIME RIGHT

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.875
NOW- I THINK THE COMMUNITY

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:03.478
COLLEGE SYSTEM- PROBABLY WILL

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:05.480
OPERATE BEST AS A MODE OF

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:07.782
EXPERIMENTATION AND SO- JUST TO

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:10.719
BE MINDFUL OF ALLOWING. EACH

01:23:10.785 --> 01:23:13.188
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO

YOU WANT TO BE MORE ONLINE BUT

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.698
TO TRY TO EXPERIMENT WITH THAT

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:25.600

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:31.539
THAT'S A STATEMENT NOT A

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:32.207
