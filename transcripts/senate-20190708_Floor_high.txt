WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. IT'S INDEED MY HONOR TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED TO ESTABLISH THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND WHICH IS BACK TO THE SENATE FLOOR ON CONCURRENCE. FROM THE STATE ASSEMBLY. BEFORE HIGHLIGHTING THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE ASSEMBLY. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THIS VOTE. AS IT REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO THE NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. IN THEIR HOMES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. OUR YES VOTE TODAY WILL PROVIDE A LONG AWAITED ACTION TO THE MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE% ADVOCATED ORGANIZED AND TRAVELED TO SACRAMENTO. TO SEEK REDRESS TO THIS FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE THE RIGHT TO CLEAN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. pTODAY MEMBERS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE EFFORTS OF MANY. BUT I FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM. AND HER TEAM INCLUDING KIP CLIPPER WHO HELPED TO NEGOTIATE THIS AGREEMENT ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS EDUARDO GARCIA AND RICHARD BLOOM. AND SENATE CO AUTHORS MY COLLEAGUES FROM SALINAS AND SINGER. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP. OF GOVERNOR NEW SOME IN HIS TEAM. WHO COMMITTED TO FINDING A SOLUTION? IN HIS INAUGURAL SPEECH. AND AT THE TIME THAT HE INTRODUCED HIS TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. IT WAS GOVERNOR NEW SOME. WHO IN HIS FIRST WEEK IN OFFICE LET A BUS TOUR TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY? TO VISIT THE IMPACTED COMMUNITY OF MONTEREY PARK WHERE HE UNDERSCORED HIS COMMITMENT. TO SECURE A SOLUTION THIS YEAR. THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHOSE TIRELESS EFFORTS HELP TO BRING US TO TODAY'S VOTE. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SOME OF THEM WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO THINK. BY NAME. SOME OF THOSE WHO HELPED TO BUILD AND LEAD THE SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER COALITION. INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. CLEAN WATER ACTION. THE WATER FOUNDATION. THE LARA SWEAR TO AND THE DOOR SWEAR TO FOUNDATION. AND THE MANY COALITION MEMBERS REPEAT REPRESENTING A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF RURAL. AND URBAN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE WITH US TODAY SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY OF LAND THERE. WHO'VE TRAVELED COUNTLESS TIMES. TO VISIT US HERE IN SACRAMENTO. FOR MANY YEARS SEEKING OUR SUPPORT IN HELPING THEM TO ACCESS CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER I WELCOME THEM AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR COMMITMENT. TO THIS EFFORT. MANY STAFF MEMBERS ALSO LABOR TO LAND THIS AGREEMENT. BUT I DO WANT TO SINGLE OUT NICK KNOWLEDGE MY STAFF POINT PERSON ON SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED TREVOR TAYLOR. FRIENDS THE AMENDMENTS BEFORE US TODAY ON CONCURRENCE REPRESENT A NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT ON THE ESTABLISHMENT. OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. SOME FURTHER DETAILS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WILL BE EXERCISED AS PART OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE RECOGNITION. THAT COMBINED WITH THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT. SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED WILL GUARANTEE A STEADY RELIABLE IN RECURRING UNDING SOURCE FOR TEN YEARS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS OFF DELAYED GOAL OF BRINGING SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER TO ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN BE TRANSFORMED. FROM AN ELUSIVE DREAM TO A NEW REALITY IN THE LIVES OF MANY CALIFORNIANS. MEMBERS I ASKS THAT YOU JOIN ME IN CONCURRENCE AND LEND YOUR NAMES TO THIS BIPARTISAN AND HISTORIC AGREEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MINING DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. WE STAND ON THIS FLOOR. AND WE PRESENT MANY. NEW MATTERS NEW LEGISLATIVE IDEAS. IN ALL AREAS OF PUBLIC POLICY. BUT THERE ARE MOMENTS ON THIS FLOOR. WHERE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SENATOR FROM MONTEREY GIVES RECOGNITION TO OTHERS HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN NOTHING LESS AN EXTRAORDINARY HE HAS BEEN DOGGED HE HAS BEEN FOCUS HE HAS BEEN PASSIONATE? IN EVERY RESPECT THIS MEASURE WOULD NOT BE BEFORE US TODAY BUT FOR SENATOR MORNINGS EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP HE IS SEEN THE VALUE WE IS TAKEN PEOPLE ALL THE STATE HE WAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE GOVERNOR GOING TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HE IS GOING TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN SO MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO NEVER WILL KNOW HIS NAME BUT THAT IS THE GENIUS OF OUR BUSINESS BUT THERE'S TIME TO WE CAN STEP UP. WE DO THE RIGHT THING WE EXTEND BEYOND THINGS OUR OWN COMMUNITY THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE TODAY THIS IS A GREAT BILL THERE'S A GREAT TESTAMENT TO EXTRAORDINARY DETERMINED LEADERSHIP I ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG CENTER ATKINS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WELL THAT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO TOP -- AT LEAST THE ENERGY LEVEL IS -- I WILL SAY BUT I I WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THIS SB TWO HUNDRED PROVIDES. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- MULTIPLE TIMES ON THIS FLOOR AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING TO PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER TO COMMUNITIES. THAT NEED IT THE MOST AND I'M GLAD SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE HERE TODAY. TO WITNESS THIS TODAY IS A GOOD DAY IT IS A VERY GOOD DAY -- BECAUSE THIS BILL PROVIDES FUNDING WITHOUT ANY NEW TAXES OR CHARGES ON WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE OR ON OUR FARMING COMMUNITY. THAT'S WHAT WE SAID WHEN WE DISCUSSED IT ORIGINALLY IT'S GONE AWAY IT'S COME BACK FOR CONCURRENCE WE MAKE PROMISES. THAT WE WOULD KEEP THE INTENT OF THIS BILL ODD TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES AND NOT -- ADD NEW CHARGESOR NEW TAXES -- FOR CALIFORNIANS IT WAS A KEY ELEMENT OF THE SENATE'S APPROACH TO THE ISSUE WE CAN HAVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER WITHOUT PUTTING NEW BURDENS ON WORKING CALIFORNIANS. THROUGH CHARGES ON WATER BILLS AND WE'VE DONE THAT. ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE THE SENATE OPPOSED ANY SPECIAL BREAKS UNDER WATER QUALITY LAWS FOR THOSE WHO POLLUTE OUR DRINKING WATER. IT'S A BALANCED PACKAGE THAT PROVIDES CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN A MANNER THAT SERVICE ALL CALIFORNIANS. IT'S A PRODUCT OF OVER THREE YEARS OF WORK. FOR THE GOOD SENATOR FROM MONTEREY. IT'S TO ENSURE THAT ARE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS DO NOT GO WITHOUT SAFE WATER IN THEIR HOMES IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THAT WE DO NOT ALREADY PROVIDE THIS IS INCREDIBLE FOR ME TO EVEN FATHOM. AND I SPOKE A LONG AGO TO LONG ON A WOMAN WHO WAS ON THE FLOOR -- BEFORE IT WENT OVER TO THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS NOT TO HAVE. I CLEAN DRINKING WATER I GREW UP WITHOUT THAT I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS AND WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA I THOUGHT. CALIFORNIA THAT IS THE FUTURE THAT IS A CUTTING EDGE THAT IS ALL THINGS THAT -- PEOPLE ASPIRE TO BE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. SO TO BE HERE AND TO BE IN THE ASSEMBLY YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE. I COULDN'T BELIEVE. THAT WE DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE THIS SO I WANT TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND COMMENDING MY COLLEAGUE FROM MONTEREY. FOR HIS PERSEVERANCE HIS STEADFAST COMMITMENT. TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IN NEED IN OUR GREAT STATE. OUR STATE WILL BE GREAT. WHEN WE INSURE THAT THERE IS CLEAN DRINKING WATER? FOR PEOPLE IN THE STATE. SO I'M THRILLED TO SEE THAT HE HAS GOTTEN THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH YOUR HELP TODAY. MAKE NO MISTAKE SB TWO HUNDRED IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD FOR ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. THAT SUFFER FROM GROUND WATER POLLUTION AND A LACK OF TWO MINUTES FOR WATER SUPPLIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IT'S NOT OFTEN WE CAN STAND ON THE FLOOR AND SAY THAT A SINGLE VOTE FOR A BILL WILL HELP TRANSFORM THE LIVES. OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS SB TWO HUNDRED WILL DO JUST THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEN SENATOR WHY CAL SKI. MADAM PRESIDENT WITH. GREAT RELUCTANCE IN -- GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR WHO I'VE WORKED WITH AND CLEAN WATER I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWO HUNDRED TODAY. I'M I VOTED FOR THE MAIN BUDGET BILL WITH THE THE COMPROMISE INCLUDED -- THAT'S BEFORE US BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE GOOD INVESTMENTS IN THE MANY TO SERVING PROGRAMS IN AB -- SEVENTY FOUR BUT I RAISE CONCERNS A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TODAY. SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED APPROPRIATES GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND MONIES AND EXPENSIVE TYPE OF ACTIONS THAT GREENHOUSE GAS -- THE GT R. F. IS REQUIRED TO FUND WITHOUT REQUIRING A DIRECT NEXUS TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REDUCING CARBON AS REQUIRED. BY A. B.. THIRTY TWO THIS IS SUPPOSED O BE A TRAILER BILL ABOUT WATER HE SAID IT'S A POLICY BILL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENLY DEBATED AMENDED INS. AND COMMENTED ON IN A MUCH MORE ROBUST MATTERS IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE DILIGENT WORK THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS THAT NO FOR THREE YEARS AND RAISING AWARENESS OF THE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE. PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE CREATING A FALSE DICHOTOMY MADAM PRESIDENT THAT IS A BY PRODUCT OF THIS DEAL REPEATING CLEAN WATER AGAINST CLEAN. AIR AND WE KNOW THE CALIFORNIA'S CAN AND MUST HAVE BOTH OF THEM. MEMBERS WERE FAR WERE FALLING FARTHER BEHIND ON OUR COMMITMENT TO MEET THE PARIS. ACCORDS WE SHOULD BE ACTING MORE AGGRESSIVELY TO CHEERING TO KEEPING OUR CREEK CLEAN AIR STANDARDS. THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME BOLDNESS ON THE PART OF BARS AND DISCIPLINE AND COMMITMENT BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THE GREENHOUSE GAS. DOLLARS ARE INVESTED WILD WISELY ESPECIALLY FROM OUR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND. DIVERTING LIMITED GREENHOUSE GAS DOLLARS AWAY FROM CUTTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THE OTHER IMPORTANT AND NOBLE CAUSES UNNECESSARY CLASSES IS NOT A PATH THAT WE SHOULD GO DOWN NOW WE'RE IN THE FUTURE. REGRETFULLY GIVEN THAT I AM UNABLE TO SUPPORT IT BUT I DO ON A PERSONAL NOTE. APPLIED MY FRIEND FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER IN FOR THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT DESERVE BETTER. THE USER RIGHT CAL SKI SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN RELUCTANT SUPPORT FOR SB TWO HUNDRED I HAVE LONG SUPPORTED INCREASE MONEY FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER PROJECTS. FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IN NEED IN FACT I AM CO AUTHOR OF A SEE A THREE BY ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA WHICH WOULD HAVE SET ASIDE 2% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES FOR CLEAN DRINKING WATER PROJECTS. IT PRIOR IT PRIORITIZE CLEAN DRINKING WATER THE WAY WE PRIORITIZE EDUCATION FUNDING THROUGH PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT MY RELUCTANCE TO THIS MEASURES THAT USES GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND REVENUES IF WE ARE SEROUS ABOUT. COMBAT IN GLOBAL WARMING WITH A CAP AND TRADE FUNDS IT SHOULD BE USED FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSES REDUCE IT REDUCING GLOBAL HOUSE A GLOBAL. HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE GLOBAL HEALTH GAS ADMISSION FUND IS NOT A SLUSH FUND. AND IN GLOBAL WARMING IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND IT CANNOT BE ADDRESSED SOLELY THROUGH REGULATIONS OR MANDATES WE MUST INNOVATE OUR WAY INTO A GREENER AND CLEANER WORLD. BY USING THOSE FINES AND LEVERAGING THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO CREATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL HELP US. OVERCOME -- THESE CHALLENGES TO BE CLEAR EVERY CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE RELIABLE SOURCE OF GOOD CLEAN DRINKING WATER. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL THIS WORK IN THIS EFFORT. BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE FOR MANY OF US AN AFTERTHOUGHT IN GOVERNMENT POLICY SO WHILE I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. MOVING FORWARD I ASK AND I PLEAD THAT WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT CAP AND TRADE FUNDS ARE SPENT ON REDUCING GLOBAL EMISSIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WILK CENTER HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANT TO THANK. SENATOR MONNING AND PRESIDENT PRO TEM ATKINS FOR FIGHTING FOR THIS MEASURE WHICH WILL BENEFIT MY COMMUNITY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. JUST LAST YEAR -- THIS TIME LAST SUMMER I WAS IN A SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AND MY DISTRICT. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO MEET WITH A LOT OF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY BUT I WAS THERE BECAUSE I WAS DELIVERING BOTTLED WATER TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AT THE MOMENT. AND I CAME ACROSS -- A COMMUNITY MEMBER. WHO WAS JUST HIRED AND FRUSTRATED AND FED UP WITH. THE CONTAMINATED WATER IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SHE EXPRESSED HER FRUSTRATION TO ME. AND SAID YOU KNOW. THERE'S TWO FAMILIES DOWN THE STREET. EACH HAVE A YOUNG CHILD AND THE BOTH. HAD TO GO THROUGH CANCER. IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT. BEING THE HERE AND THE BLAME. WAS THE CONTAMINATED WATER IN THIS IN THIS COMMUNITY. AND SO. THIS BILL IN THE EFFORT BY ARCTIC SENATOR OF MARIE -- WILL SIGNIFICANTLY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO MY DISTRICT IN THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND IT GOES WAY BEYOND -- SAFE DRINKING WATER IT'S QUALITY OF OF OF THE HEALTH. IN HOUSE THERE [inaudible] AND SO. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. CALIFORNIANS CANNOT GO WITHOUT THE SAFE DRINKING WATER THIS IS A MAJOR STEP. FORWARD FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT THAT SUFFER FROM THE GROUND WATER POLLUTION AND THIS IS A BILL THAT. IT'S THREE YEARS AT OUR COULD CENTER HAS WORKED ON AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW LET YOU KNOW THAT. OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL BUT ALSO WILL ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE. NOT JUST FOR OUR COMMUNITY BUT FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER SIPPING Q.. AND FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER HURTADO SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF LIKE TO WHAT ECHO OUR COLLEAGUES -- KNOWLEDGE MINT -- OF THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS THE STEADFAST WORK. SOMETIMES WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HOLDING ON TIGHT TO AN ISSUE YOU CAN'T CROSS THE GOAL LINE THAT THREE YEARS FELT LIKE I'M SURE A HUNDRED IN DOG YEARS BUT YOU'VE MADE IT ACROSS I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU. YOU KNOW SB TWO HUNDRED IS THE TRAILER BILL FOR FAITH IN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED -- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO AB ONE HUNDRED WHICH WE DID HERE IN SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON JUNE TWENTY FOURTH. WHICH HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND SO WHEN I SAY SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR I WANTED TO PROVIDE VERY CLEAR -- EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT MEANS. SB TWO HUNDRED MADE MINOR CHANGES TO AB ONE HUNDRED MINOR INCLUDED IT ADDED CO AUTHORS WE ADDED FINDINGS AND DECLARATION THAT WE CHANGED ONE TERM FROM FUND INFORMATION PLAN. TO FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN. SO FOR THOSE WHO FELT THAT THEY'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HEAR AND FULLY THAT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THIS BILL -- I WOULD ARGUE TO THE CONTRARY. THIS IS THE TOP BUDGET PRIORITY FOR THE SENATE DEMOCRATS THIS YEAR TO CREATE THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUN WITH A DEDICATED ON WHEN REVENUE SOURCE WITHOUT. HAVING TO TAX MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS AND THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT. AND I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER STONE. THINK ABOUT A PRESIDENT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB [inaudible] TWO HUNDRED HA. I REPRESENTS SOME IMPOVERISHED AREAS WERE I THINK -- THEY'RE GOING TO BECOME THE BENEFICIARIES SOME FUNDS TO ENSURE. WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT? THAT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE DEPENDABLE CLEAN DRINKING WATER ANYWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. H. TWO O. BOTH THE MOLECULE OF LIFE BY FRIENDS -- I WANT. TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM MONTEREY -- I HAVE BEEN SO IMPRESSED WITH HIS FOCUS -- THE THE CHALLENGES THEY YOU'D THINK A SIMPLE BILL LIKE THIS WOULD. BE ABLE TO BE DONE WITH COMMONSENSE. PEOPLE LIKE WE HAVE A THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT SHOWS YOU THERE'S NO EASY TASKS. HERE ON THE RED FLOOR OR THE OR THE GREEN CARPET. BUT TODAY IS A THE CELEBRATION IS THE CELEBRATION OF LEADERSHIP. BECAUSE I HONESTLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE HERE TODAY. I WITHOUT THE THE TREMENDOUS -- WORK. OF OF MY FRIEND FROM MONTEREY WHO. CAME AND SAT WITH THE EARLY ON DURING THIS PROCESS IN THE ONLY ISSUES WHAT WE HAD. REALLY WITH HIS GOALS WAS THE WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND IT. HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. ADDING ANOTHER FIFTY OR TAX TO THEIR WATER BILLS OF THE TAP -- CAN MAKE IT VERY ONEROUS AND VERY PAINFUL FOR FOR MANY THESE PEOPLE. SO I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THAT I I REPRESENT. A DISTRICT I REPRESENT. WITH YOU FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT AFTER THIS. PASSES AND GETS TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO ARE. I I APPLIED FOR SIGNING THIS BILL THAT WE CAN ALL STAND IN UNITY AND SAY. THAT EVERYONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR FINANCIAL STATUS. WHETHER IMMIGRATION STATUS. CAN HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I KIND OF WISH WE COULD CALL IT. MORNINGS LAW BECAUSE HE CERTAINLY DESERVES THE CREDIT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. AND IT'S AN HONOR TO STAND ON THE FLOOR WITH HIM. AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THEY WERE CARRYING IT OVER THE FINISH LINE TODAY SIR. THANK YOU CENTER STONE SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT IS MEASURE. AND ONE OF KNOWLEDGE AS SO MANY MY COLLEAGUES HAVE THIS SOLDIER. OF JUSTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS. FINALLY MAKING GOOD ON A PROMISE TO SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING -- AND IT'S NOT JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY ISSUE. BUT THEY'RE HURTING THEIR IMPORTER BILL LIKE TO HURT IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES LIKE THEIR HURT IN THE NORTH SALINAS VALLEY IT'S IT'S TRUE ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND RARELY DOES ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY FOR MANY OF US GET SO GROUNDED IN IN LIFE. BUT I DID WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALSO BY SENATOR -- MY COLLEAGUE -- ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED YOU KNOW I CONSIDER THIS VOTE TODAY. BOTH. A MEASURE SUPPORT FOR CLEAN WATER IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT ALSO HAS TO BE EMBEDDED IN IT A PROMISE. BECAUSE THE FUNDS THAT WERE CUT. TO MAKE ROOM FOR THIS CLEAN WATER PRIORITY WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE HAS TO BE A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE FACT THAT WILD FIRE RESILIENCE FUNDS WERE CUT TO MAKE ROOM. OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A FUNDING FOR RESILIENCE. IS SIMPLY A CHOICE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING. THE CARBON PRICE RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS. THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON DEVELOP BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. IN THE WORLD PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH SAID IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A TON. SO WHY IS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA PAYING HALF OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE. TO THE CARBON PRICING CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE FACED WITH THIS CHOICE OF DECIDING BETWEEN CLEAN CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER IF THEY ACTUALLY REFLECT. THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY REFLECT AN ACCURATE CARBON PRICE. SO I THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE AND AT THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO MAKE OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD ABOUT CARBON PRICING. AND THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE SOME BIGGER DECISIONS HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY DO BOTH IN THE STATE. I THINK WE CAN SOLVE WILD FIRES IN CLEAN AIR AND WE CAN SOLVE CLEAN DINKING WATER. SO I HOPE WITH THIS AYE VOTE TODAY. HOW WE ALL COMMIT OURSELVES TO FILLING THAT FULL PROMISE -- TO BRING A MEASURE OF JUSTICE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS.

THREE NINETY TWO ASSEMBLY BILL THREE NINETY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEBER AN ACT RELATING TO PEACE OFFICERS. SENATE MITCHELL THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MISS VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES TODAY. I PROBABLY RISE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL THREE NINETY TWO THE CALIFORNIA ACT TO SAVE LIVES. THIS BILL SEEKS TO RAISE CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL STANDARD FOR WHEN POLICE CAN USE DEADLY FORCE. TO MATCH BEST PRACTICES ALREADY IN PLACE IN SOME DEPARTMENTS. AND THAT WE KNOW WORK TO KEEP BOTH OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC FACE. THIS BILLS GOAL IS TO SAVE LIVES BOTH IN FRONT. AND BEHIND THE BADGE. THIS BILL WILL NOW WORK BECAUSE OF THE BUY IN FROM BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. I'D LIKE TO UP LIVE THE ADVOCACY OF THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE TURNED OUT. WHO SHARED THEIR TRAGEDIES THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOOR INTO A MOVEMENT TO ENSURE THAT NO OTHER FAMILIES EXPERIENCE THE LOSS OF A LOVED? ONE MORE TIMES THAN NOT. AND AN ARMED LOVED. ONE COLLEAGUES AB THREE NINETY TWO WAS ABOUT PREVENTING UNNECESSARY DEATHS BY CLEAR FINE LONG FORCES OBLIGATIONS WHEN MAKING THE DECISION TO USE DEADLY FORCE. AB THREE NINETY TWO REPLACES THE CURRENT VAGUE STANDARD THE OFFICES CAN USE DEADLY FORCE WHENEVER QUOTE REASONABLE STANDARD WHAT THEY HIGHER STANDARD THAT AUTHORIZES DEADLY FORCE. ONLY WHEN NECESSARY TO DEFEND AGAINST AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. THE BILL IS SQUARELY IN LINE WITH BEST PRACTICES AND STANDARDS RECOGNIZED BY ACADEMICS AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND IS MODELED AFTER POLICIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE AT SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE STANDARDS ARE KNOWN TO REDUCE SERIOUS USES OF FORCE WITHOUT HAVING ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OFFICER SAFETY OR PUBLIC SAFETY. AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL AND IT SING IT SENATE COMPANION BILL. ALL AGENCIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO UPDATE THEIR POLICIES TO INCLUDE THESE BEST PRACTICES. AND TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS ARE TRAINED TO THE STANDARDS. CALLING WITH REGARD TO THE TRAINING. BUDGET ACTIONS WERE TAKING THIS YEAR TO SUPPORT THIS NEW EXPECTATION [inaudible] MORE OVER. PEACE OFFICER IN STANDARDS TRAINING PULSE TRAINING. THE BUDGET INCREASE THIS YEAR ABOVE THEIR BASELINE FUNDING. IS A 75% INCREASE. IN ADDITION TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. PACIFIC WE IDENTIFIED FOR TRAINING FOR DE ESCALATION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. SO IN THIS INSTANCE WE HAVE PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR CORE BELIEFS STAND. A TRAINING AND WE HAVE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THE TRAINING. THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL IN THESE HALLOWED HALLS AND IN THE PUBLIC AND IN THE MEDIA. I HOPE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT AND APPRECIATE THE BILL SPONSORED BY OVER TEN ORGANIZATIONS AND HAS OVER ONE HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED GROUPS IN SUPPORT. THE POWER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE DEADLY FORCE. UNDER THE COLOR OF AUTHORITY IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITY WE CONFER ON ANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL OUTSIDE OF THE MILITARY. AND IT MUST BE GUIDED BY THE GOAL OF SAFEGUARDING HUMAN LIFE. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OF A. B.. THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU CENTER. MEMBERS WE HAVE SEVERAL. SENATORS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GO THROUGH OUR FIRST. THREE REGULAR SENATOR MORLOCK. SENATOR NIELSEN. AND THEN TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR BRADFORD. THEY'RE MORE LIKE THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE NINETY TWO AND ITS COMPANION SB. TWO THIRTY COLLEAGUES AS VICE CHAIR OF PUBLIC SAFETY I LISTEN TO LENGTHY AND PASSIONATE TESTIMONIES PRESENTED. WHEN NT CALLED OUT FOR TEMPORARY REQUESTED TO OTHER COMMITTEE MEETINGS? BUT A VERY MOVING. COLLEAGUES WHEN I SERVED AS ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR. THERE WAS AN INCIDENT WHERE A DEPUTY SHERIFF. SHOT AND KILLED A MAN WHO DECIDED TO MOVE HIS PARK ISSUE BE FORWARD. HE HAD HIS TWO DAUGHTERS IN A ROW OF SEATS DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM. THE OFFICER SHOT INTO THE DOOR A FEW TIMES [inaudible] KILLED HIM. THE MAN WAS BLACK. HE WAS A DRILL SERGEANT FROM. THE CAMP PENDLETON MARINE BASE. HE COULD HAVE ACTED AND BEHAVE IN A CALMER MANNER. BUT THE DEPUTY SHERIFF COULD HAVE WITH HELLFIRE. OR SIMPLY SHOT OUT A TIRE. TO WHEN THE MATTER CAME TO A CLOSE SESSION AND I DON'T WANT TO BETRAY ANY CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS BUT WHEN IT CAME TO CLOSE SESSION I SIMPLY STATED. THAT WE SHOULD GIVE THE WIDOW AND HIS CHILDREN WHATEVER THE REQUESTED. I WAS IN NO [inaudible] MOOD. TO VOTE TO FIGHT. IN A LAWSUIT. OR TO MEET THEM IN COURT. THE COUNTY WOULD SETTLE FOR FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THE DEPUTY WOULD BE CLEARED OF THE FATAL SHOOTING. THE PROSECUTOR SAID THE SHOOTING WAS TRAGIC IMPOSSIBLY PREVENTABLE BUT THE DEPUTY HAD ACTED REASONABLY AND HAD DONE NOTHING TO WARRANT CRIMINAL CHARGES. COLLEAGUES WE NEED TO REDUCE. THESE TRAGIC. AND POSSIBLY PREVENTABLE. EVENTS DEADLY FORCE SHOULD ONLY BE USED WHEN NECESSARY. THEY ARE DEVASTATING TO FAMILIES THEY DISTURB THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY'RE COSTLY TO TAXPAYERS. TO THE LOGGINS FAMILY. AGAIN EXPRESS MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES. TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY LET'S HOPE THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING KEEPS EVERYONE SAFE. FOR AB THREE NINETY TWO HAS BEEN A SOUL SEARCHING EXERCISE ONE THAT HAS BROUGHT BACK OLD IN SAID PERSONAL MEMORIES. I HOPE THIS BILL STRIKES THE RIGHT BALANCE MISTER PRESIDENT -- AS PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL HAVE DIFFICULT RESPONSIBILITIES WE LEARN THAT TODAY. BY HONORING TURNER O'SULLIVAN ON THE FLOOR WHEN WE STARTED OUR SESSION. POLICE OFFICERS SOMETIMES LIKE AIRLINE PILOTS THEY CAN ONLY MAKE A MISTAKE ONCE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB THREE NINETY TWO THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH AS JUST. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE DEAN AND SENATE CENTER NIELSEN. JUST PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THE EARLY VERSIONS OF THIS BILL. I ACTIVELY WORKED AGAINST. BEFORE IT WAS EVEN BEGINNING TO MEN. WHEN ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE? IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. THE DISASTER FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND FOR JUSTICE. I COMMANDED THE IMPROVEMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND VARIOUS. GROUPS WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. AND THIS PRESERVES OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THESE VERY DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. AND KEEP IN MIND IF YOU'RE A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL ON THE LINE. THERE'S A FURTIVE MOVEMENT. AND YOU DO FEEL THAT YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER YOU DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SAY HEY BUDDY CAN WE SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE CAN WE LOOK TO SOME ALTERNATIVES COULD YOU TRY THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER THING. FOR THE SAFETY OF THAT OFFICER IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL THERE IS NO TIME. FOR THOSE DECISIONS. AND THOSE OFFICERS DO NOT HOLD THE TOTALITY OF THAT EXPERIENCE MEANING FROM WHEN THEY GOT THE DISPATCH WHAT WAS. FOR WHEN THEY WENT TO THE SCENE AND SAW WHAT THEY WERE RESPONDING. TO AND WHEN THEY SOUGHT AND APPREHENDED FOR EXAMPLE AN INDIVIDUAL. OR CAME UPON. THE SCENE OF AN INCIDENT. THEY TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. AND THEY ALREADY ARE THOROUGHLY TRAINED. IN ALL ARGUE THAT THERE'S NOT. ANON DO NUMBER. OF THESE TRAGEDIES. BUT THEY ALL ARE TRAGEDIES. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO. DIED. THEY HAVE FAMILY. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS THE VICTIM. OF THAT CRIME WHATEVER THAT CRIME MAY HAVE BEEN EVEN A RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY. THEY PAY A PRICE. TO THEY HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY HAVE TO SERVE [inaudible] FEAR. BUT THIS DOES PROVIDE FOR THE TOTALITY OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE CONSIDERED. BY THAT OFFICER [inaudible] TO BE. HEATING THEIR TRAINING. AS A ALREADY DO. BUT THESE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS THE RESULT IN COCKADED INTO THE BILL. DO MAKE IT I THINK. A STEP. IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. TO ALLEVIATE CONCERNS OF MANY OF THOSE WHO FEEL VERY STRONGLY. AGAINST THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED. IN ONE FORCED MINISTERS AND THEY ALSO ARE ACCOMMODATING TO THOSE OF US. WHO ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS? OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. AND THOUGH I WILL VOTE YESTERDAY. I RESERVE MY OPPORTUNITIES TO BE VIGILANT IN THE FUTURE. IF THERE ARE ANY ATTEMPTS TO CHANGE. THE VERBIAGE IN THIS LEGISLATION. HARKENING TO THAT FORMER LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD BE SO ONEROUS. WE MUST NOT PUT [inaudible] THE HANDCUFFS. ON A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. AND ASK THEM. TO PROTECT US. AND TO PRESERVE JUSTICE. THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER THE CENTER BRADFORD THEY WERE GONNA GO TO SENATOR SKINNER. AND SENATOR ARTILLERY. CENTER BRADFORD THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT AND I STAND HERE TODAY AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR AND BY SURE OF LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE NINE TWO A MEASURE WHOSE TIME IS LONG. OVERDUE AND IT'S CALM. IN MANY WAYS TO SPREAD THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURE I WILL VOTE ON AS THE LEGISLATURE. BUT SINCE MANY OF YOU'VE NEVER SPENT A DAY IN MY FAIR GOBBLES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE BLACK. AND FACE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE'S BEEN MUCH DEBATE. ABOUT THIS ISSUE [inaudible] WELL NEEDED. THIS MEASURE STARTED OUT AS A POLICE REFORM BILL. WELL WHAT WE HAVE THE DAY AS FAR FROM IT IT'S A TRAINING BILL. AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT. BECAUSE I'VE COME TO THE REALITY IT'S NOT ART POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT NEEDS REFORMING IT'S OUR HEARTS AND MINDS WHEN IT COMES TO RACE IN THIS COUNTRY. BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON RACISM IT WAS FOUNDED ON THE SLAVERY OF BLACK PEOPLE. THE ANNIHILATING OF THE RED MAN. AND EXPORT EXPLOITATION OF THE BROWN. AND YELLOW MAN. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WHITE. AND YOU LIVE IN MALIBU. IN SAN FRANCISCO IN BEVERLY HILLS YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS FOR YOU. WE SAW JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. A WOMAN WHO LET LAPD AND HIGHWAY PATROL ON A MAT CHAOTIC CHASE FOR HOURS [inaudible] FOUR HOURS. THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF PROPERTY DESTRUCTION. THREE PEOPLE SENT TO A HOSPITAL AS WELL AS TWO DOGS INTO THE HOSPITAL. SHE AT EXIT HER VEHICLE AND RAN NOT ONE SHOT WAS FIRED HE IS LIVE TO TELL HER STORY THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS WHITE. BUT JUST TWO WEEKS AGO. A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN IN MY DISTRICT WHO WAS SIMPLY BACKING HIS CAR OUT OF A DRIVEWAY. VERY SLOWLY IN THE APARTMENT BUILDING HE LIVED IN. THIRTY FOUR SHOTS. THIRTY FOUR SHOTS. ON ARMED BLACK MEN. AND WILL BROOK LOS ANGELES THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT. AMERICA'S FOLKS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF WERE. I WANT TO DRIVE HOME. THE RACE ISSUE. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO IN FORT MYERS FLORIDA. WE HEARD ABOUT THE MAYOR -- BARRICADED HIMSELF IN HIS HOUSE AND SHOT REPEATEDLY AT LAW ENFORCEMENT. REPEATEDLY AT LAW ENFORCEMENT HE IS ALIVE TODAY TO TELL HIS STORY NOT ONE SHOT WAS FIRED AT THIS INDIVIDUAL. DID I FILL THE MENTIONED THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS QUITE. THEY DO NOT FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER WHITE MEN WITH GUNS BUT THEY FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH NO MORE. THAN A CELL PHONE RUNNING. FROM POLICE SO MEMBERS WE NEED TO REFORM OUR HEARTS. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE HISTORY. OF USE OF DEADLY FORCE WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THERE WAS NO RISING CRIME IN CALIFORNIA LET ALONE AMERICA AND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHAT HAPPENED IN. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO BLACK FOLKS WERE FREE AND THAT WAS ANOTHER TOOL. TO EXECUTE AND KILL BLACK FOLKS SO I'M DEEPLY SADDENED WHEN LAST WEEK. AND HIRE A AT TWO OF OUR COLLEAGUES VOTED TO AGAINST ETHNIC STUDIES BECAUSE OF WE HAD ETHNIC STUDIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ARE UNIVERSITIES WOULD PROBABLY TELL THE STORY OF RACE A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT WE DO TODAY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE THE COMPARISON OF RACE. TWO YEARS AGO IN MINNESOTA. A OFFICER SHOT ON ON ARMED. WHITE WOMAN. HE STATED HE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE. THE CHIEF QUICKLY ONE ON PUBLIC TV. EVERY TO KILL THE OFFICER FOR A SHOOTING OUT OF POLICY THAT OFFICER WAS QUICKLY FIRED. AND SURELY THERE AFTER HE WAS CHARGED. WITH MURDER. TWO MONTHS AGO HE WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER WAS BECAUSE THE VICTIM WAS WHITE AND UNARMED. WAS IT BECAUSE THE OFFICER WAS BLACK AND HE WAS MUZZLE. THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD HERE. AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR OUR LONG PORTS BUT I DON'T HOLD OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S ROOTED IN RACE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID THE NEGRO IN AMERICA GETS. TWICE AS MUCH AS WHAT IS BAD IN ONLY HALF OF WHAT IS GOOD IN AMERICA THAT. DEALS WITH OUR COURT SYSTEM OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM ON HOUSING. R. I. N. YES OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS. HE'S STILL EXIST TODAY. DR KING ALSO STATED WE CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED AS LONG AS THE NEGRO IS THE VICTIM UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS OF POLICE BRUTALITY. THAT WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE IS STILL APPLIES TODAY. IT STILL APPLIES TODAY. SO COLLEAGUES. I WANTED TO REFLECT. ON WHERE WE ARE AND WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. AGAIN IT WAS NOTHING HAPPENING IN AMERICA IN. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THAT WARRANTED THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE OTHER THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME. WHO WERE FREE? AND I CHALLENGES. TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF RACE. FAR BEYOND AGAIN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S TIME FOR US TO CHANGE OUR HEARTS. AND OUR MINDS [inaudible] BECAUSE AGAIN. STEP ON CLARK SIMPLY RUNNING FROM THE POLICE. ANY LOST HIS LIFE IN HIS GRANDMOTHER'S. BACKYARD EASIER FOR A MENTALLY CHALLENGED INDIVIDUAL WHO COMPLY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE CITY OF A LACK LA WITH HIS HANDS UP. WE SHOT THREE TIMES IN HIS BACK. OSCAR GRANT RAN REALLY PULLED OFF A TRAIN IN OAKLAND. ON NEW YEAR'S DAY. SIMPLY BECAUSE HE LOOKED LIKE A GANG MEMBER AND HE WAS SHOT IN HIS BACK. EVEN IN NEW YORK WERE THE AMP IMPLEMENTED STOP QUESTION IMPRESSED. DURING MAYOR BLOOMBERG'S TENURE. STOPPED QUESTION AND PRESSED WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN OR LATINO. OF THE MAJORITY NINE HAD A WEAPON. NONE KICK COMMITTED A CRIME AND NINE HAD OUTSTANDING WARRANTS BUT YET IT YET AGAIN 70%. STOP QUESTION IMPRESSED. I HOPE THIS TRAINING THAT. AB THREE NINETY TO BRING FORTH AGAIN WILL CHANGE NOT ONLY THE PRACTICES BECAUSE AGAIN. ONE FORCE WE GET TO WRITE WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER. FOLKS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE MAY. IT'S A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND PEOPLE OFTEN ASK WHY DO AFRICAN AMERICANS RUN FROM POLICE. WE'VE BEEN RUNNING FROM THE TORY SINCE YOU BROUGHT US HERE IN SLAVE SHIPS FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO. WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING FROM THE TOWARD. AND MY MOTHER USED TO CALL MY GRANDMOTHER. HE IS TO SAY IT'S BETTER TO SAY THERE HE GO. IN THERE HE LIVES. WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT. AND ALSO THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO AGAIN TEACHING AND AFTER AMERICAN HOME WHEN HE ENCOUNTERS LAW ENFORCEMENT VERSUS AND WHY DON'T. THE FIRST TIME I EVER SPENT THE NIGHT AWAY FROM. OUR HOME THAT WASN'T WHAT A FAMILY FRIEND WAS AT MY BEST FRIEND'S HOUSE ANTI WEISS. AND I LISTEN TO HIS FAMILY AND THEIR INTERACTION. WHAT POLICE IN WAS FAR DIFFERENT IN THE CONVERSATION WE HAD IN MY HOUSE SO? IN THAT HOUSE SO IT WAS. HEY IF YOU'RE STOP YOU GET THAT BADGE NUMBER YOU GET THAT OFFICER'S NAME AND YOU MAKE SURE YOU LET HIM KNOW WHAT YOUR MOM AND DAD AS IN MY HOUSE SOLD. YOU WERE TOLD TO SHUT UP. MAKE SURE YOUR HANDS -- IN CLEAR SIGHT AND SAY YES SIR NO SIR AND HOPE YOU MAKE IT HOME SAFELY. AGAIN I USED EXAMPLE FIVE YEARS AGO AND HEARING THE COMMITTEE HERE. SELECT COMMITTEE ON BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AND WE WERE DEALING WITH THE INTERACTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE HAD A POLICE CHIEF. WHO WAS TESTIFYING? AND WE ASK THEM ARE THERE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER BLOCKING BROWN. ANY HESITATED FOR A MOMENT AND HIS EYES WELLED UP WITH TEARS. AND HE SAYS YES THERE IS HE SAYS BECAUSE THE CONVERSATION I HAD TO HAVE WITH MY SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON. THE DAY HE GOT HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE IS A CONVERSATION MY COLLEAGUES DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE. THAT POLICE CHIEF WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN. AND HE SAID HE HAS HE'S HERE WITH HIS SON IS NOT. IF YOU'LL BE STOPPED IT'S WHEN YOU WILL BE STOPPED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO COLLEAGUES I ASKED FOR A YES VOTE. BECAUSE THERE ARE DOUBLE STANDARDS BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AT A WHOLE OF FOG MY WHOLE RACISM AT FAULT AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO DEAL WITH-THAT. TOO AND CALIFORNIA IN AMERICA AS PRIVATE. SIR BRADFORD WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ELOQUENT TESTIMONY. NOW LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT THANK YOU MEMBERS AND THANK YOU -- MY COLLEAGUES FROM. GUARDIAN AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR VERY ELOQUENT TESTIMONY -- AS CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET COMMITTEE. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND ALSO TO HAVE IN THE BUDGET -- PART -- SHEPHERDED MUCH OF THE FUNDING FOR THE POST TRAINING MULLIN REATTACH ABOUT WHY. WE USE TERMS LIKE IMPLICIT BIAS THERE'S A LOT OF TERMS WE USE NOW. BUT THE FACT IS. THAT VAST AMOUNTS OF RESEARCH VAST AMOUNTS. DEMONSTRATE THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. REGARDLESS OF OUR COLOR. REGARDLESS OF OUR PROFESSION I'M TALKING ABOUT AMERICANS. DUE TO THE LONG SEATED. AND SYSTEMIC RACISM. THAT OUR CULTURE AND OUR COUNTRY. WERE FOUNDED ON WERE BUILT ON THAT THE LAWS WERE BASED ON THAT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS BASED ON JUST EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION IN OUR COUNTRY AND I STATE THIS. NOT TO SAY THAT I AM NOT A PROUD AMERICAN. NOT TO SAY THAN I AM AT THE LEAST BIT EMBARRASSED ABOUT OUR BILL OF RIGHTS OR OUR CONSTITUTION. I LOVE THEM. BUT I KNOW ALSO. THAT THOSE WORDS. WERE NOT DESIGNED TO PROTECT EVERYONE AND THAT OVER TIME WE'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT. AND WE ARE WORKING TO CORRECT IT. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE WE HAVE HAD TO DO MUCH TO CORRECTED MUCH AND WE STILL HAVE TO DO MORE. SO I SEE IT MORE JUST TO BE CLEAR AND HONEST AND RECOGNIZE IT [inaudible] ENACT RESULTS IN THAT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT [inaudible] BLACK PEOPLE. BROWN PEOPLE OFF ALSO OFTEN SOMETIMES A P. I. BUT PRIMARILY BLACK PEOPLE [inaudible] THAT. THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL INTENT. THAT THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO VIOLENCE. ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS. WE SHOW THESE SURVEYS WHERE. WE ARE DESCRIBED THERE'S DESCRIBED A CRIME THAT OCCURRED. AND THEN WERE -- THE PERSON IS DESCRIBED AND THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO CIRCLE YOU KNOW WHO THEY WHO THAT PERSON MIGHT ABED. ANOTHER'S PICTURES [inaudible] IT'S THE PERCENTAGE OF ARE CIRCLING THE BLACK PERSON AND THAT'S AGAIN NO MATTER WATER COLORS. IS WAY HIGH SOFT THE CHARTS SO. BECAUSE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS. THE RESULTS IN MANY MANY BAD CONSEQUENCES. BUT THE WORST. IS THE PROVEN INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR A BLACK PERSON TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I DON'T BLAME ONLY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THAT THOUGH CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO REALLY ARE NOT GOOD APPLES. BUT THESE BIASES ARE SO DEEP. THEY CAN ONLY BE CORRECTED IF WE ARE INTENTIONAL. IF WE RECOGNIZE IT AND IF WE ACT WITH PURPOSE. AND THIS BILL. IS AN ACT WITH PURPOSE. IT IS IN FACT THAT BY RAISING THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD. IT WILL LESSEN. THE DANGER AND RISK. THAT A BLACK PERSON WILL DIE AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO TO ABSOLUTELY. NOW WILL IT A TOTALLY ELIMINATE NO. AND WE MAY FIND OVER TIME. WE HAVE TO GO A LOT FARTHER. BUT IT DOES STRIKE A VERY IMPORTANT BALANCE AND WITH THE POST TRAINING AND WE HEARD FROM SECTION ELOQUENT RESEARCHER. IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY. COMMITTEE RECENTLY AND I AM FEELING VERY EMBARRASSED THAT I CANNOT REMEMBER HER NAME. BUT SHE'S DONE RESEARCH ON HOW WE CAN TRAIN [inaudible] TO BASICALLY. BECAUSE THAT THAT JUST CHANGING THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD ALONE WILL NOT DO IT. AND THAT ONLY CERTAIN KINDS OF TRAINING WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE OUR BIAS. AND THERE'S GOOD RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT WILL. THAT WILL THEN. NOT ONLY. PROTECT. THAT BLACK PERSON FROM THAT RISK AT THE HANDS OF THE OFFICER BUT PROTECT OUR OFFICERS. SO TO ME THIS BILL IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOES THE APPROPRIATE BALANCING. IT RECOGNIZES. THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THEMSELVES EVERY TIME THE DONNED THEIR UNIFORMS. AND WALK OUT THEIR DOOR. THEIR LIVES ARE AT RISK. AND NONE OF US WANT TO INCREASE THE RISK. TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND THE WORK DONE BY THE AUTHOR. FIRE PRO TEM IN HER STAFF. BY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN AND WORK WITH THE AUTHOR THAT WORK. AND OTHERS WERE INVOLVED IN A TWO RESULTED IN A BILL. THAT APPROPRIATELY PROTECTS. LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT MOST IMPORTANTLY CORRECTS. CALIFORNIA'S USE OF FORCE STANDARD. TO PROTECT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE RESIDENTS WHO ARE MOST AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR LIVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHICH IS OUR BLACK RESIDENTS. AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. AS I SAID SOMETHING. IT IS ON US TO CORRECT. AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE PART OF THAT CORRECTION. AND I'M ALSO VERY PROUD THAT THE TRAINING IS PART OF IT. IN [inaudible] AND I'M. FIND WE WILL BE MONITORING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAINING INCLUDES THAT BIAS TRAINING THAT IS SO ESSENTIAL BECAUSE OTHERWISE. WHEN WE STAND HERE AND VOTE FOR THIS BILL? WE WANT IT TO WORK WE DO NOT WANT THIS JUST TO BE SYMBOLIC WE ACTUALLY WANT. TO CHANGE THAT BY S. AND THUS. REDUCE THE DEATH BECAUSE IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND I WOULD FINALLY SAY [inaudible] SOME. PEOPLE WERE JOKING. WHEN AROUND ME WHEN [inaudible] THE AND I'M NOT TRYING TO CRITICIZE THEM BUT WHEN THE RAPPER WHO IS IN HIS MERCEDES. AT THE FAST FOOD STOP IN VALLEJO ANY FELL ASLEEP. HE FELL ASLEEP. HE HAD I DON'T KNOW IF THE GUN WAS IN HIS LAP I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE ACTUAL RECORDS BUT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PORTRAYED WAS THAT HE DID [inaudible] AND THE FAST FOOD WORKERS. CALLED THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T REVIVE FROM THERE THE DOORS WERE LOCKED AND ALL BUT HE WAS STATE TO SLEEP AND THEY NEEDED HIM TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. SO THEY COULD GET THE NEXT CUSTOMERS THEY DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARFUL OF THEIR LIVES THEY WERE JUST TRYING. TO GET THE DRIVE THROUGH GET THE CUSTOMER'S. BUT WHEN THE POLICE CAME AND A KNOCKED ON HIS WINDOW AND OF COURSE STARTLED. HE WOKE UP [inaudible] HE WENT. TWO IS SUPPOSEDLY TO HIS LAP FOR THIS GUN HE DID NOT LIFTED UP IT REYES SAID HE WAS DEAD BEFORE THAT. BUT THE POINT OF BRINGING UP IS THAT SOME FRIENDS MY JOKED THAT. IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ME AND THEY WERE JOKING JUST BECAUSE I'M WHITE BUT THEY WERE LIKE. SOME COPS ARE YOU. SITTING IN THE CAR AN OLD LADY AND ME NOT TO PUT MYSELF DOWN. A WHITE WOMAN. WITH A GUN IN HER CAR IN VALLEJO THEY JUST THINK YOU WERE TRYING TO PROTECT YOURSELF. AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER. MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR ARCHULETA THEY WERE GOING TO SENATOR PAN AND THEN COPY HERE. SEARCH A LETTER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. YOU SO VERY MUCH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND MY SENATOR FROM GARDENA WHAT A GREAT JOB HE DID IN HIS PRESENTATION. AND HOLLY MITCHELL I WILL POINT YOUR NAME OUT WHAT A GREAT JOB YOU'VE DONE. AND I KNOW -- THE COMMUNITY REPRESENT. BUT THIS BILL OPENS THE DOOR IS THE FIRST STEP AS I SEE IT NOW I SEE THAT THE JOINT. BILL AB THREE NINETY TWO THAT THAT BRINGS THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TOGETHER UNDERSTANDING THAT SOMETHING HAD TO GET DONE. AND I'M SO PROUD THAT WE HAVE COME TOGETHER AS LEGISLATORS THAT. RECOGNIZES AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ISSUES OUT THERE IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. AND OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WITH A BLACK HISPANIC WEBER. THAT ISSUES NEED TO BE RAISED. AND IT STARTS WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY WHERE THEY RECEIVE THE TRAINING. AND THE GUIDANCE AND THE EQUIPMENT AND THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR THAT TRAINING. SO POST IT'S GOT A LOOK INTO THEIR STANDARDS POSES GOT IT SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO SENSITIVITY TRAINING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THAT NEEDS TO BE AT THE MINUTE IMPLEMENTED IN OUR POLICE ACADEMIES WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOKED LIKE CALIFORNIA. LOOKED LIKE ALL OF US. IF WE CAN GO BACK IN HISTORY THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY GO BACK IN HISTORY IN THE FORTIES WHEN THE JUKE SHOOTERS WERE BEATEN -- IN THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES THAT HAPPENED. WITH AND THAT WAS AGAINST THE MILITARY FOR GOD SAKES BUT BECAUSE THE THE JEW TUTORS WERE ENJOYING THEIR MUSIC THEIR CARS AND THEY WANDERED OFF EAST LA IN. AND INTO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES THE MILITARY WERE WERE CALLED IN TO BE EATEN AT THAT THE RIOTS HAPPENED. SO THERE'S HISTORY ON ON EVERY SIDE IF WE LOOK FOR IT. BUT I THINK THE HISTORY IS IS A IS WITH US RIGHT NOW. THE THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS IT AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO NUMBER. TWO IN THAT ORGANIZATION NUMBER. TWO HOW MANY GENERATIONS UPON GENERATIONS HAS IT TAKEN. AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES ARE COUNTY SHERIFF NUMBER ONE HISPANIC AMERICAN. WE ARE MAKING INROADS IN EDUCATION WE'RE MAKING INROADS EVERYWHERE WE GO BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL REALIZE NOW THAT WE ARE. ALL. ONE IN WE TALK ABOUT. THE WOMEN IN THE MILITARY WE TALK ABOUT WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WE TALK ABOUT. WOMEN IN THE QUALITY AND PAY AND SO ONE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER IT STARTS WITH JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE SO MUCH TO DO. SO IT'S NOT CHEST WHAT'S HAPPENING RACIAL WISE IT HAS TO DO WITH. WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE COMMUNITIES IN THAT'S NUMBER ONE I BELIEVE IS JOB MEALS EDUCATION THE HOMELESS SO MANY THINGS? BUT IN THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT BILL WHAT I'M PROUD OF IS WE'VE COME TOGETHER WE'RE ALLOWING. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT TO GO INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT. UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PART OF THE BEST. THE BEST TRAINED AND BEST ORGANIZED THAT WILL EVER HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. WITH THIS BILL. SO I KNOWLEDGE WHAT WE'RE GOING WE'VE GOT A LONG WAYS TO GO. BUT I KNOW WERE UNDERWAY EQUALITY FAIRNESS ACROSS THE BOARD SHOULD BE WHAT WE'RE AFTER AND I THINK THIS BILL SET IT FORTH SO I THANK YOU ALL. FOR GOING FORWARD WITH THIS TO OPEN UP THE DOORS TO ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND AND COMING TOGETHER. EVERY LIFE DOES MATTER AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER PAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD EVENING THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. CENTERS I TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND FOLKS WHO WORK TOGETHER -- TO TO COME TO AGREEMENT AROUND THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW STEFAN CLARK DIED IN MY DISTRICT. AND THERE'S A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. AND I THINK THAT -- AND FORTUNATELY -- YOU KNOW HIS STAFF IS FORTUNATELY NOT A SINGULAR EVENT. AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A DISPARITIES. AND I THINK OF MY GOOD FRIEND FROM GUARDINO SPOKE. TO THAT -- THE FEAR THAT'S OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. AND I'M GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER -- AROUND THIS BILL. HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THIS BILL WILL CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND EDUCATION. HOPEFULLY -- WILL ALSO CHANGE -- ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS BECAUSE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT BUT WELL WE CAN TRY TO EDUCATE AND IMPROVE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT -- TRAINING -- WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING CULTURE. AND UNDERLYING CULTURED AND UNFORTUNATELY HAS RESULTED IN -- PARTICULARLY BLACK MEN DYING DISPROPORTIONATELY. AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND SO WELL CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THIS ON HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS BILL WILL CHANGE. THAT. NOT TO DISTINCT CHANGE THAT CURVE -- I WOULD ALSO AY IS IS THAT A WORK IS NOT DONE IF THAT DOES NOT CHANGE. SO CERTAINLY WE WANT TO GIVE THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND I KNOW THAT THE FOLKS FROM WHAT THE PEOPLE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO -- CAME TO AGREEMENT. WHAT SEE A CHANGE -- TO BUT WE DO NEED TO CHANGE [inaudible] THOSE NOT JUST NUMBERS ALISON NUMBERS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE SITUATION PEOPLE'S LIVES. SO I AM PROUD TO STAND SUPPORT THIS BILL TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT -- THIS BILL. UNLESS IT'S TRULY EMBRACE AND PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IF THEY HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST WHAT THIS BILL CALLS. FOR PEOPLE HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST WHAT THIS BILL CALLS. FOR AND SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES. UNDER WHICH PEOPLE [inaudible] LIVE. WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT FEELS LIKE THAT THEY'RE OPERATING IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN PERCEPTION THEIR OWN SAFETY. AND SO THAT WE CAN -- TRULY. ELIMINATE THE DISPARITY THAT WE SEE AND THE FEAR AND JUSTIFIABLE FEAR IN MY MIND THAT WE SEE. N.

CENTER COPIER. GOOD EVENING.

WE COULD GO TO THE COMMUNITY AND TELL THEM LOOK THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND HERE'S THE REASON THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT AND SO -- I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK HER FOR FOR HER HARD WORK AND ALSO FOR HER -- HER COMMITMENT TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN -- IN THE LEGISLATURE -- PEOPLE TALK ABOUT NEGOTIATING AND AND WORKING THINGS OUT AND THEN THEY THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO BUT DOCTOR WEBER SINCERELY WANTED TO AND I AND I REALLY WANT -- TO GIVE HER KUDOS FOR THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF PAIN IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THIS IS THE FIRST STEP I THINK SOMEONE ELSE SAID IT A LITTLE BIT MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I DID THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE -- SOME PEACE AND AND ASSURANCE THAT WE LISTENED. THAT -- SOME CHANGES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT. UP PART OF THE PROCESS IS THAT -- THAT WILL HAVE NEW RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FOR POLICE OFFICERS -- THAT WILL BE PART OF THE POST TRAINING PROGRAM. AND THAT THE POST THAT WE'RE GOING TO INVEST MONEY IN POST TRAINING SO THAT. OFFICERS CAN CAN GET THE TRAINING THAT THEY NEED IN IN PLACE IN AN EXPLICIT BIAS AND UNDERSTAND -- WASTED DE ESCALATE AND TO BE ABLE -- TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE AS WELL AS KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE AND AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT SHOWS THAT A TROUPE.

THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] MEMBERS. WHEN IS A GOOD EVENING TO THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM [inaudible] CENTER ACT. MISTER PRESIDENT. I WANT TO START BY THANKING MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR PRESENTING THE BILL ON THE FLOOR TODAY -- YOU KNOW LAST SESSION I I MADE A COMMITMENT. TO A COLLEAGUE AND A FRIEND. THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD MAKE IT TO THIS FLOOR. AND WE KNEW THAT IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF WORK BECAUSE WE WEREN'T THERE LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T WE HADN'T HAD THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE OBVIOUSLY NEEDED TO HAVE. BUT WE'VE HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOW IT'S TAKEN A LONG HERE. OF COMMITMENT BY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO'S ON THE FLOOR IN THE BACK TODAY AND YOU KNOW WE WANTED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY FURTHER TO DIALOGUE IN THE DISCUSSION. ANY TIME YOU FORCE LEGISLATION I IN A WAY THAT -- PEOPLE. BOTH SIDES AREN'T HEARD. IT'S NOT A RECIPE FOR A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD OR SUCCESS. AND WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY WITH AB. THREE NINETY TWO IT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD. THE FALL OUT OF NOT. ADDRESSING ISSUES LIKE THIS HAS BEEN SEEN ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE. AND WE WANTED TO DO THIS IN A WAY. THAT RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WE WANTED TO REALLY ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT OBVIOUSLY. IS QUITE A SWORE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AS WE TRY -- TO TO FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY AND AT THE SAME TIME RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE MARGINALIZED WHO ARE OVERLOOKED TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT HEARD? I WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM PICO RIVERA WHO TALKED ABOUT. THIS BEING CRITICAL STEP BUT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT COME ALONG WITH HEALING A COMMUNITY -- THAT HAS FELT THE PAIN -- AND THAT IS ECONOMIC JUSTICE. AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT EVERY DAY. SO THAT EVERYONE FEELS ACCESS. BUT SINCE LAST YEAR. I WOULD SAY THAT WE'VE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS. A AFTER SESSION ENDED BRINGING DIFFERENT GROUPS TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN THOSE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS NEEDED TO ARRIVE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. WE KNEW THAT CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT USE OF FORCE STANDARD WITH OUTDATED AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL. DOING NOTHING WAS NOT AN OPTION BUT PLEADING FOR A LITTLE MORE TIME TO TRY TO BRING SOMETHING FORWARD THAT WE ALL COULD FEEL -- PRETTY GOOD ABOUT WAS ALSO NECESSARY [inaudible] THE BILL. BEFORE YOU TODAY BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO MAKES CALIFORNIA'S USE OF FOR STANDARD A MODEL. A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE NATION. THAT'S WHAT THAT WORK. MAY PUT BEFORE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE. AND HOPEFULLY TAKE THAT DIALOGUE FORWARD AND FIND WAYS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT PEOPLE CAN WORK TOGETHER. SOON HOPEFULLY VERY SOON WE WILL SEE THE COMPANION. BILL SB TWO THIRTY AUTHORED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SALINAS REFERENCED ALREADY ON THE FLOOR. THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE TRAINING -- THAT WE NEED TO MAKE REFORM AFFECTED IF WE IF WE DON'T PUT THE RESOURCES THERE. TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THAT'S A PART OF THE EQUATION. I WANT TO COMMEND EVERYONE INVOLVED THE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS. THAT WERE ABLE. TO TALK TO A STEP FORWARD AND SHARE WITH US THEIR STORIES LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHO SHARE THEIR STORIES? I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS. FOR THIS WORK FOR NOT WALKING AWAY FROM THE DISCUSSION. EVEN WHEN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WERE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND THEY WERE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- OUR PUBLIC SAFETY CHAIR AND THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT AN EASY CONVERSATION EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WE'VE HAD TO ADDRESS PEOPLE'S FEELINGS. AND THE LANDS FOR WHICH THEY PUT THINGS THROUGH FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO THE VICTIMS AND I I'VE FAMILIES OF VICTIMS. WHO CAME FORWARD TO SPEAK AND I HAVE TO SAY IT WAS NOT A SIMPLE THING TO WEAVE TOGETHER? TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND KEEP THE PARTIES. COMING TOGETHER TO WORK TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD AGREE UPON. AND YOU DID THAT. SO I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU IN YOUR ENTIRE COMMITTEE -- MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE TO THE LEFT ALSO SERVED ON THAT COMMITTEE IS HE SAID -- AND LASTLY I JUST WANT TO THANK MY A FRIEND OF MY DEAR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO. WHO TOOK A RISK AND BELIEVE TO ME WHEN I SAID LET'S GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME I DON'T KNOW? IF WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT I THINK WE MUST WORK AT IT TOGETHER. AND SHE TOOK THAT SHE TOOK THAT. STEP AND SHE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD GET IT DONE BUT IT WAS HER WORK. AND HER TENACITY AND HER PASSION AND HER COMMITMENT TO HER COMMUNITY -- THAT'S ENABLED US TO BE HERE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO COMPLETING. ALL OF THE WORK WE NEED TO DO ON THIS. THAT WE DO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND TOGETHER I THINK WE REALLY WILL FEEL PROUD AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN WE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR COUNTRY? AND WE BRING THIS MODEL FOR WORK I ASK AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. HEARING SEEN NO OTHER DEBATE. SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MISTER PRESIDENT I WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. YOU KNOW COLLEAGUES [inaudible] REYES [inaudible] MATTERS. AND TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE IS A BLATANT DENIAL OF THE OBVIOUS. YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE WORK TO DO. TO CHANGE OUR PERSONAL IN. TO NOT BE HERE A YOUNG MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS IS HOOKED UP ON HIS HAND OVER HIS HOODIE. TO NOT FEAR A YOUNG MAN PERHAPS WITH A SHAVED HEAD WITH TATTOOS ON HIS NECK. WALKING DOWN THE STREET. TO NOT PASS INSTANT JUDGMENT BASED ON NO ACTION OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. BUT MERELY BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE THEM DO AND MEETING. ALL OF US IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WITH IN MY LIFETIME MY LIFETIME MY OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT LAPD. WENT FROM HAVING NO AFRICAN AMERICAN OFFICERS WITHIN ITS RANKS. UP UNTIL THE WATTS UPRISING OF SIXTY FIVE TO HAVING BLACK CHIEF. FLORAL. TO HAVE AN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION THAT SELF FUNDED THEIR OWN IMPLICIT BIAS. TRAINING. SO CLEARLY WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. BUT IT'S ALL OF US ON THIS FLOOR IF WE CHOOSE TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES MUST ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO RACE MATTERS. I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR HIS DEEPLY PERSONAL SENTIMENT. AND I APPRECIATE HIS OBVIOUS UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE NEED FOR BALANCE. BALANCE TO CREATE TRUE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL. AND TO THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO CONTINUE TO DEBATE LANGUAGE THAT'S NO LONGER IN THIS BILL I SAY THIS. I TOO AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. I SUPPORT A LAW ENFORCEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE CHARGED TO SERVE. AND I DEEPLY RESENT ANY ASSERTION OTHERWISE. IT'S OBVIOUS TO SO MANY THAT THE CURRENT. REASONABLE STANDARD OF USING FORCE AND SPECIFICALLY DEADLY FORCE SET FORTH IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT PROTECT PEOPLE'S FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS. DAN FOR FAR TOO MANY. THOSE INSTANCES DON'T APPEAR TO BE JUST. BECAUSE CLEARLY JEFF THIS IS NOT BLIND. AND THAT'S WHY MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO HOLD THEMSELVES TO A HIGHER STANDARD. UPDATING THEIR USE OF FORCE POLICIES TO ADOPT BEST PRACTICES LIKE REQUIRING DE ESCALATION WHEN FEASIBLE. USING FORCE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE LAWN FORSMAN OBJECTIVE. AND GROUNDING THEIR POLICIES IN THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE OF ALL HUMAN LIFE. BY AUTHORIZING PEACE OFFICERS TO USE DEADLY FORCE ONLY WHEN NECESSARY TO DEFEND AGAINST AN IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. AND CONSIDERING THE ACTIONS OF OFFICES LEADING UP TO USE THE FORCE. AB THREE NINETY TWO WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA UP. TO THAT HIGHER STANDARD. AB THREE NINETY TWO IS THE NECESSARY STEP. TO AFFIRMING THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE AND PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS. FAR TOO MANY DAYS HAVE GONE BY WITH FAR TOO MANY DEATHS BECAUSE OF THE INACTION OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE POWER TO ENACT CHANGE. WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THAT TODAY. THE NEED FOR REFORM IS CLEAR AND LONG OVERDUE. THE NATION IS WATCHING. OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. BECAUSE WE ARE LIVING IN A TINDER BOX OF RACIALLY MOTIVATED TENSION IN OUR COUNTRY. AND FOR THOSE REASONS THIS HAS TO WORK. IT'S TIME FOR US TO ENACT A STATE WIDE POLICY. THAT WILL THAT WILL WITHOUT QUESTION. FAITH HUMAN LIFE. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASK THAT YOU VOTE FAVORABLY. FOR A. B.. THREE NINETY TWO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. ARCHULETA.

ASSEMBLY BILL TEN FIFTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN AND ACTUALLY IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEIR FOREIGN DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. SENATOR DODD THE FLOOR IS YOURS. MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS WE'VE ALL LEARNED HARD LESSONS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRES% DEVASTATING OUR STATE. CLAIMING LIVES DESTROYING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOMES AND BURNING MILLIONS OF ACRES. IT'S CLEAR WE MUST RAPIDLY ADAPT TO RESPOND TO THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER CAUSES DRIVING THESE MONSTER INFERNOS. TOO OFTEN ELECTRIC UTILITIES ARE BLAMED. FOR THESE DEVASTATIONS AS A STATE WE MUST HAVE SMART POLICIES TO KEEP US SAFE AND PREVENT RATEPAYERS FROM GETTING HIT WITH A TREMENDOUS COSTS OF THESE WILDFIRES. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR HAS BEEN A TICKET TEAM EFFORT WITH THE AUTHORS AND GOOD CENTERS FROM VAN NUYS IN SAN DIEGO. ALONG WITH OUR LEADERSHIP. GOVERNOR NUISANCE TEAM DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR CAUGHT THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO DEVELOPING THIS BILL AND TAFFY ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS. OUR STATE SPACES. BUT NO PLAN IS PERFECT. BUT NEITHER IS WILDLIFE'S SICH WILDFIRE SITUATION WE FACE AS CALIFORNIANS. CLIMATE CHANGE IS DRIVING MORE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THAN EVER AT A TIME WHEN THE STATE'S LARGEST UTILITY P. GENIE IS UNFORTUNATELY DUCT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. UNDER STATE LAW. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE SOLUTION. IT WILL HELP COMPENSATE PASSED IT PRESENT VICTIMS. PREVENT FUTURE DISASTERS FOR PROTECTING IT PROTECT UTILITY RATE PAYERS FROM SUBSTANTIAL RATE INCREASES. CLEARLY IT'S A LIFELINE FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS. MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS NOT A UTILITY BAIL OUT. IT'S ALREADY PAYER BILL OUT. IT REQUIRES P. GENIE IN THE STATE'S OTHER TO BIG UTILITIES TO PONY UP FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS UTILITIES WILL NOT BE ALLOWED. TO MAKE A SAID A PROFIT FROM THOSE EXPENSES. THE PLAN ALSO CREATES A LIABILITY FUND TO HELP SHIELD CUSTOMERS FOR THE COST OF FUTURE WILDFIRES. INCLUDING THE COST OF CAPITAL BECOME WITHOUT RISK. IN THE LARGE I USE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THAT FUND. IT ALSO MANDATES A STRICT ONE YOUR TIME LINE FOR P. JEANNIE TO EMERGE FROM CHAPTER ELEVEN INSURING SETTLEMENTS ARE PAID. TO ALL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRE VICTIMS IN THE BILL IMPROVES ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF UTILITIES. THESE KEY MANDATES INCLUDE. REQUIRING A MORE ROBUST WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANTS THE COVERS THREE YEARS. BOLSTERING SAFETY BY INSURING PHYSICAL COMPLIANCE AUDITS ARE CONDUCTED. ESTABLISHING THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES SAFETY ADVISORY BOARD IN A NEW WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME A STANDALONE DEPARTMENT. SOLELY FOCUSED ON SAFETY. PROVIDING A CLEAR WERE RECORD STANDARD SKEWS ME PROVIDING A CLEAR STANDARD FOR COST RECOVERED CUT RECOVERY THE HOLDS BAD ACTORS RESPONSIBLE. IT CREATES NEW PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION THREE TIMES GREATER THAN EXISTING LAW. IN MANDATED THAT THE CPUC PROTECT THE INTEREST. OF REPAIRS EMPLOYEES THE OF A UTILITY CHANGES CONTROL. THIS BILL IS THE PRODUCT OF DELIBERATIVE IN PUBLIC PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES REPORTS FROM THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE AND THE WILDFIRE COMMISSION ESTABLISHED BY MY SB. NINE OH ONE DOING NOTHING. IS NOT AN OPTION IF WE SIT IDLY BY UTILITY RATES COULD DOUBLE. UNDER THE STATUS QUO. WE TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS LAST YEAR INCLUDING STRENGTHENING OUR FIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE CAPABILITIES. IN WE BUILD ON THAT FOUNDATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WITH THE SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENTS BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE TO DO. I EXPECT THAT MANY OF THE BILLS INTRODUCED THIS YEAR ON WILD FIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION WILL HELP FILL OUT SOLUTIONS. PUT FORWARD IN THIS BILL. OUR FOCUS MUST REMAIN ON COMPENSATING VICTIMS STOPPING NEW WILDFIRES IN PREVENTING OUTRAGEOUS. COSTS ON REPAIRS THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CHANCE TO MAKE MAJOR STRIDES TOWARD TOWARDS THOSE AIMS IT COULDN'T COME SOON ENOUGH. THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED WHILE I WILL BE SUPPORTING AB TEN FIFTY FOUR AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR HERTZBERG FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY. AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE CENTER HERTZBERG [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MADAM PRESIDENT. TODAY MADAM PRESIDENT. IS AN IMPORTANT DAY. IN THIS LEGISLATIVE CHAMBER. OVER MANY YEARS WE HAVE PROUDLY PASS [inaudible] LANDMARK. MEASURES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE HOPES AND DREAMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. BUT SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. WE'VE ENACTED MINIMUM WAGE. WE HAVE PASSED MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD CONSUMERS FROM EVERYTHING FROM FRAUD TO THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED DOZENS OF IMPACTFUL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS OF EXONERATED THE INNOCENT AND BUT FAIRNESS TO IT OFTEN DEEPLY FAULT FLAWED PROCESS AND JUST TODAY. WE PASSED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND SOMETHING OF EXTRAORDINARY IMPORTANCE AND OF COURSE WE HAVE ENACTED CREATIVE AN AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES BUT MEMBERS. BUT WITH REGARD TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES IN MY VIEW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY THAT SLOWS DOWN THE DISTANT THREAT. OF CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT THIS MEASURE. AB TEN FIFTY FOUR ADDRESSES THE URGENCY AND IMMEDIACY OF CLIMATE CHANGE HERE AND NOW. OUR GREAT FORMER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. CALL THIS EXTREME WEATHER IS WE'VE ALL HEARD THE NEW ABNORMAL. IT'S A PERIL THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY NOT JUST BECAUSE OF ITS REMARKABLE COMPLEXITY. BUT BECAUSE IT TOUCHES EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE AFFECTING CALIFORNIANS IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF ALL AGES AND POLITICAL PARTIES RIGHT NOW HERE EVERY DAY. EVERY YEAR. CALIFORNIANS DEPEND ON WELL I A BILL RELIABLE ELECTRICITY FOR MORE THAN JUST LIGHTS. RELY TO TO POWER HOSPITALS IN THE NEEDED NEONATAL UNITS. ARE MASS TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN OUR MODERN COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. AND WHAT ECONOMIST MEMBERS TO DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. WHICH BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS JUST ONE JUST ONE HARSH ELEMENT OF THIS NEW ABNORMAL. OUR STATE'S HISTORY BEARS NO RESEMBLANCE. TO THE REALITY OF TODAY. THE RISKS OF OF ALL THE ALARMING RATE. YEARS OF DROUGHT CREATED A PERFECT STORM. FOR WILDFIRES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE WHICH WAS ARTICULATED IN GOVERNOR BROWN'S EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS ON TREE MORTALITY IN. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THIS LED TO SEVEN OF THE OUT OF TEN OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. OCCURRING IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS WITH ALMOST FIVE MILLION ACRES BURNED. IN THAT TIME AND NEARLY TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR LIVES AND THOUSANDS MORE. LOST EVERYTHING. THIS NEW REALITY HAS RESULTED IN STAGGERING COSTS IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS THEIR ENERGY PROVIDERS THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT CONNECTS THEM. WITH REGARD TO THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES ON OUR SYSTEM OF ELECTRICITY DELIVERY. WE ARE FACED WITH A PROBLEM OF FOUR PARTS. MAINTAINING A SUPPLY OF SAFE AND RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY. TO ENSURING THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OUR ELECTRICITY UTILITY SYSTEMS IN A MANNER THAT IS FAIR TO RATE PAYERS. THREE EQUITABLY COMPENSATING VIST VICTIMS OF THE RECENT HORRIBLE WILD FIRES AND FOR FORTIFYING OUR STATES COMMUNITIES WITH THAT AT A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AGAINST FUTURE WILD FIRES. FIGURE OUT HOW TO RECONCILE EACH OF THESE CHALLENGES FEELS LIKE THREADING TEN THOUSAND EAGLES WHILE RIDING. A UNICYCLE BACKWARD. THAT IS WHY AT NINETY EIGHT PAGES LADIES AND GENTLEMAN NINETY EIGHT PAGES AND NEARLY FORTY TWO THOUSAND WORDS THIS MEASURE BEFORE US A. B.. TEN FIFTY FOUR IS THE SIZE OF A SMALL BOOK. IT ALONG WITH SEVERAL TRAILER BILLS DOES THE FOLLOWING. IT IMPACTS FIVE DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA CODES AND SIX STATE AGENCIES IT ESTABLISHES INTRICATE CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND RESTRUCTURE SOPHISTICATED LEGAL STANDARDS. AND IT PROVIDES FOR THE CREATION OF NEW GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES AND TO MULTI BILLION DOLLAR FUNDING SOURCES TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF WILDFIRES PASS. AND INTO THE FUTURE. THIS SMALL BOOK IN FRONT OF EACH OF US WAS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF A SMALL ARMY OF PUBLIC SERVANTS. WHO WORK LIKE CRAZY TO GET IT DONE? FROM THE FIRST DAY IN OFFICE LITERALLY THE FIRST DAY IN OFFICE I THINK CLOSE TO IT. WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY WAS FILED TO STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS? TACKLING THIS EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE WAS A PRIORITY FOR OUR NEW GOVERNOR. AND SO MANY OF US WHO WORK CLOSELY WITH HIS CHIEF OF STAFF AND OTHERS. AUTUMN ON A SONG TOAST AND YOU WAY AFTER THE WILLIAMS AND PATTERSON AND THE TEAM FROM O'MELVENY MYERS AND GUGGENHEIM. TOGETHER THEY WORK THEIR HEART OUT THEY WORK LATE NIGHTS AND THEY WERE JUST EXHAUSTED AND YET DEEPLYCOMMITTED TO GETTING IT RIGHT. OUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU THANK YOU. BOTTOM PRO TEM YOU HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DRILL DOWN ON THE SERIOUS. COMPLEX ISSUE THANK YOU FOR GUYS IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND FOR BEING INCLUSIVE THROUGHOUT THE CONVERSATION AS WE WORK. WITH YOUR HARD WORKING STAFF TO ENSURE THAT RATE PAYERS AND VICTIMS WERE PROTECTED. AND PUTTING IN THE TIME TO FINE TUNE THE DETAILS THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM. SENATOR DODD IN IS EXTRAORDINARY STAFF CHIEF OF STAFF THANK YOU GUYS YOU ARE ROCK STARS YOU HAVE WORKED IT LIKE CRAZY SENATOR HUESO AND CHIEF CONSULTANT MEDIA SHE IS JUST NOTHING LET MEDIA. BUT HE SAYS NOTHING LESS THAN BRILLIANT AND REALLY PUT A LOT OF HARD WORK AND OF COURSE MY OWN STAFF. N. THOUGH COMPLEXES IT MAY BE I STAND HERE IN SUPPORT OF WHAT I DEEM TO BE AN ELEGANT AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. AND THAT IS. AB EIGHT TEN FIFTY FOUR BEFORE US WE HAVE A MEASURE THAT INTELLIGENTLY BALANCES THE INTEREST OF FIRE VICTIMS RATE PAYERS. UTILITIES AND OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. IT IS A MEASURE THAT STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ENERGY SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WERE INSURING THAT RESILIENCE AGAINST WHATEVER PERILS MEKONG. AND IT STRIKES A VERY A DIFFICULT YET CORRECT BALANCE BETWEEN THE ISSUE OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION ON THE ONE HAND AND CREATING AN INSURANCE FUND AND FINANCIAL STRUCTURE THAT AVOIDS BANKRUPTCY. FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT PROVIDE ELECTRONS OF CALIFORNIANS. OKAY ROOSEVELT ONCE SAID. IN A MOMENT OF DECISION IN ANY MOMENT OF DECISION THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS DO THE RIGHT THING. THE NEXT BEST THING YOU CAN DO. IS DO THE WRONG THING. AND THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS DO NOTHING. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE IN THIS MOMENT OF DECISION IT IS THE RIGHT AND TIMELY SOLUTION. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BECAUSE AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE THE COST OF DOING NOTHING IS SIMPLY TOO HIGH. DOING NOTHING LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST TWELVE DOLLARS A MONTH. IN TERMS OF INCREASES IMMEDIATELY TOOK TO RATEPAYERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE-THE HIGH COST OF BORROWING WE JUST SAW HERE ON PAGE SEVENTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE COMMITTEE TODAY. UP TO THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONAL COST IN INTEREST COSTS TO RATEPAYERS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T GET THIS DONE AND SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THIS IS. EXTRAORDINARY WE HEARD THE TESTIMONY OF DOCTOR STEPHEN WEISSMAN AT UC BERKELEY GOLDMAN SCHOOL TESTIFYING TO THE SAME THING. IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE INDEPENDENT. ON THE THE I. O. U.'S WOULD NOT HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO INVEST MONEY FOR PREVENTION THIS REQUIRES A SENATOR DODD INDICATED INVESTMENT OF FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS AN ADMISSION TICKET. JUST TO GET ACCESS TO THE WILD FIRE INSURANCE FUND SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY IT DON'T DO ANYTHING THE RISK IS EVEN HIGHER. AND FAULTY PREVENTION MEASURES I SAY MEANS MORE FIRES AND MEETS DEADLIER FIRES. THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO. AS MANY MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR KNOWS THE REMAINS QUESTIONS ABOUT FIRE INSURANCE POLICIES. FOLKS WHO LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN REDLINED WERE POLICY HOLDERS HAVE BEEN CANCELED WITH NO NOTICE OR VERY LITTLE NOTICE AND LITTLE OR NO ABILITY CHOIR ALTERNATIVE INSURANCE OR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RATES THAT HAVE SKYROCKETED. WE NEED TO FURTHER ADDRESS ENHANCE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN TO PROTECT PROPERTY AS WELL AS SENSIBLE LAND USE AND ZONING POLICIES. MANY OF THOSE IDEAS ARE CONTAINED IN MEASURES STILL PENDING BEFORE US BY MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE. AND BY MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES WE WILL BE ADDRESSING THIS IN MY BEST JUDGMENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS SESSION BUT NOT TODAY. ALMOST TWO DECADES AGO SOME OF US WERE SERVING IN THIS BUILDING WHEN DEREGULATION AND MARK MARKET MAKE MANIPULATION DROVE CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY SECTOR TO THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE MADAM PRESIDENT. AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE FACE ROLLING BLACKOUTS AND SOARING ENERGY PRICES. AT THAT TIME P. GENIE AGAIN FOR BEFORE THIS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THE RISK OF PLUNGING IT'S COMMUNITIES INTO DARKNESS THE STATE WAS FORCED TO BUY POWER AT IT RAGES COSTS. IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND ONE THIS LEGISLATURE FACED WITH SEEMINGLY LIKED AN IMPOSSIBLE DILEMMA. IN THAT MOMENT OF DECISION WE WERE CALLED UPON TO BE TO BOLDLY AND WE DID PASS AMONG OTHER MEASURES AB ONE X. BY THEN ASSEMBLY SPEAKER PRO TEM FRED KAYLEE. WHICH CONTAINS THE IN FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF THE GW ARE BONDS WHICH ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. MEMBERS MILLIONS OF ACRES OF PRISTINE CALIFORNIA LAND NOW IS IN ASHES. HUNDREDS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST THE NEW ABNORMAL WE ARE FACING TOGETHER HAS CLEAR PROSPECT TO BRING YOUR ENERGY SYSTEM TO ITS KNEES RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT OF SO MANY. WE ARE WE IN THIS HOUSE IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND WITH THIS GOVERNOR HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STEP UP. TO BE BOLD THE BALD MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE US WE WILL THROUGH THE BOARD MEASURE BEFORE US WE WILL LEAD CALIFORNIA OUT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT NONE OF US NONE OF US COULD HAVE EVER PREDICTED. YET THAT IS OUR JOB OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE IT OUT FIX IT AND GET IT RIGHT. MEMBERS I EMPHATICALLY ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN ANSWERING THAT CALL IN CASTING AN AYE VOTE TODAY FOR A. B.. TEN FIFTY FOUR THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG FURTHER DEBATE AND DISCUSSION SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I CAME HERE SIX AND A HALF YEARS AGO TO THE STATE ASSEMBLY. FROM A COUNTY OF LASSEN. DATA. IS VERY OVERGROWN WITH FUEL. AND I TALKED ABOUT WILD FIRE FROM THE DAY I CAME I'VE HAD MANY OF YOU. OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN LEGISLATORS TO MY DISTRICT -- SHOWING THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION. CALIFORNIA NATURALLY BURN EVERY TEN TO TWELVE YEARS. BEFORE WE CAME. EN US STARTED PUTTING OUT FIRES SO WE HAVE A HUGE MASSIVE LOAD OF VEGETATION. NOW THIS BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TALKS ABOUT UTILITY TO PROVIDE POWER. THROUGH THIS MASS MAYES OF VEGETATION. ONLY TWO OUT OF TEN FIRES IN CALIFORNIA -- APPROXIMATELY ARE MARK CAUSED BY UTILITIES. SO WE REALLY HAVE -- TO OBVIOUSLY KEEP. THEM WHOLE SO WE CAN MANAGE -- GETTING POWER TO OUR COULD CUT A CONSUMERS. BUT THE BIGGEST THREAT WE HAVE IS TOO MUCH VEGETATION. LAST YEAR WE DID SB NINE OH ON WORK VERY CLOSE WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA AND MANY OTHERS. BECAUSE WE HAD THE TUBS FIRE WE HAD THE BUTTE FIRE. WE HAD THE CAR FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING AT THE TIME WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING. THE BILL THAT NINE OH ONE BILL. AND THEN THIRTY DAYS AFTER WE GOT NINE A ONE PASSED WE HAD THE CAMPFIRE THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST DEVASTATING FIRE. BECAUSE A LEGISLATOR WE HAVE TO PLAY THE HAND WE'RE DEALT. IN UNFORTUNATELY THE HAND WE HAVE DEALT TO US TODAY IS THAT WE HAVE -- ONE UTILITY THE GENIE IN BANKRUPTCY. DUE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. WE HAVE TWO OTHER. I'LL USE THAT ARE ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY. SO WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS PASS THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT THE RATE PAYERS WILL BE LEVELED OUT AS GOOD AS YOU CAN. IN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. NUMBER TWO ALL THOSE VICTIMS WHO LOST THEIR HOMES. IN THE TUBS FIRE IN THE CAMP FIRE. WHOTHEIR COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY RIGHT NOW HAVE A SECURE? WAY TO GO AFTER THOSE FUNDS. THAT THE THE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO PUT UP THE THE THE REVENUES TO OFFSET THE COST OF THEM. THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO LOST HER HOME WHO IS UNDER SHIRT OR NOT INSURED. BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY. YOU HAVE NO WHERE TO GO IF YOU'RE IN THE P. JEANNIE TERRITORY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOUR BANKRUPTCY. SO THIS A PERFECT BILL ABSOLUTELY NOT. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO I WOULD JUST VENTURE TO SAY MOST OF THE MEMBERS HERE KNOW THAT TOM THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PIE. WE'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF CAP AND TRADE BILLS WE'VE MOVED OUR PS STANDARD UP I VOTED AGAINST ALL THOSE BILLS. WE REGULATED THE COMMERCIAL TRUCKS I OWN. THE LAWN MOWERS THE WE YEARS BECAUSE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION AS WE LET OUR POOREST. BURN IT'S WRONG WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE BIGGEST EMITTER OF CARBON WHICH IS FORCE FIRE CALIFORNIA. SO I WANTED. COMMITTEE YOU I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THOSE WHO LOST EVERYTHING. I THINK WE HAVE. FOR ONE FIRE AWAY OR COUPLE FIRES AWAY FROM BEING RIGHT BACK HERE ON THIS FLOOR THIS THIS ISN'T A FIX ALL. THIS IS PART OF A LONG TERM PROCESS WE DIDN'T GET HERE OVERNIGHT IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS TO GET HERE. BUT IT'S OUR JOB TO DO THE RIGHT THING THE RIGHT THING IS TO VOTE FOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND THEN LET'S GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD IN THE START LOOKING AT THAT VEGETATION. IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO HAVE. THE CLEANING DONE AND THE VEGETATION MOVE THE THERE'S THERE'S THREE THINGS THAT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO HAVE FIRE OXYGEN. FUEL AND IGNITION. THERE'S TWO THINGS WE CAN'T CONTROL OXYGEN AND IGNITION BUT WE CAN'T CONTROL THE FUEL. THAT'S FOR ME TO TARGET WE NEED A TARGET ON THE FUEL MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. AS SAFE AS WE CAN AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO STABILIZE OUR UTILITIES AND THEN WE NEED TO TACKLE THE BIG PROBLEM WHICH IS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE I HEARD AND I ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS AT THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT. THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I WANTED TO SEE IN A BILL AND TODAY I BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT. I WANTED TO SEE RATE PAIR PROTECTION. CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND A NEWLY CREATED FOR TWENTY SURE ONGOING SAID SAFETY MEASURES WERE IN PLACE. THE MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY INCORPORATES KEY ASPECTS THAT WILL ENSURE THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE. AND CITIZENS AND IT'S ALSO A VICTIM FOCUS WE HAVE HEARD OF MANY VICTIMS COME FORWARD AND SHARE THE STORIES AND WE CANNOT FORGET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE BEHIND POLICIES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE PRIORITIZE OUR TAXPAYERS OVER PROFITS. EQUALLY IMPORTANT IT HOLD. PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS I'M ALSO ENCOURAGED THAT AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WILL MEDICAID FUTURE WILDFIRES BY ENGAGED IN GAUGING NATIONAL EXPERTS ON WILDFIRES IN UTILITIES WHO WILL SIT ON THE NEWLY CREATED. WHILE FIRE SAFETY BOARD ADDITIONALLY IT WILL ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO REGULARLY CHECK SAFETY STANDARDS IN ISSUE CERTIFICATIONS. WE CAN ALL AGREE THE BAD ACTORS NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THIS PROPOSAL DOES THAT AND IT AND INCENTIVIZE IS UTILITIES TO ACT PRUDENTLY. UTILITIES WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE PROOF OF ACTING IN GOOD FAITH BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO TAP INTO THE WILDFIRE FUND. MEMBERS EXECUTIVES CANNOT CONTINUE TO MAKE PROFITS ON THE BACKS OF TRAGEDIES. WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO THE TO THE SAME THING WITH THE SAME PEOPLE AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS. THAT'S WHAT I'M ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT WE'RE BRINGING NATIONAL EXPERTS TO THE TABLE. AS CHAIR OF INSURANCE. I SEE THAT IN ADDITION TO STABILIZING THE IMPACT A WILDFIRE IN OUR ENERGY INDUSTRY WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE WE HAVE A STABLE INSURANCE MARKET. FOR THE SAKE OF HOMEOWNERS WE NEED A HEALTHY MARKET THAT OFFERS A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS HOMEOWNERS NEED. THAT ENSURES THAT THEY GET THE PROTECTION THEY DESERVE SHOULD AN UNFORTUNATE EVENT OCCUR AND THAT KEEPS COST AFFORDABLE. I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THAT INSURANCE SERVICES AND PROTECTIONS ARE PART OF THE CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. FOR NOW ON THE CREATION OF A WILDFIRE FUN IS ESSENTIAL FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND REPAIRS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BOTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT I DO WANT TO RAISE A CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY SOME OF THE MUNICIPALITIES IN MY DISTRICT. I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE -- MERCED IRRIGATION DISTRICT MODESTO IRRIGATION DISTRICT PER LOCK IRRIGATION DISTRICT IN OUR REGION AND THEY PROVIDE SERVICE TO CONSTITUENTS AND I HAVE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF DOING SO FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SOUTH SAN JOAQUIN IRRIGATION DISTRICT HAS BEEN EN A COURT BATTLE ESSENTIALLY FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS FIRE TRYING TO ACQUIRE ASSETS IN SOUTH SAN JOAQUIN IRRIGATION DISTRICT. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE POWER CHART CONSTITUENTS IN THAT AREA. PC CODE SECTION EIGHT FIVE ONE ALREADY EMPOWERS THE PC TO ANALYZE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OF ASSETS FROM ELECTRICAL OR GAS COMPANY TO ENSURE THAT THE REMAINING BUNDLE CUSTOMERS ARE NOT ADVERSELY IMPACTED. THIS BILL ALSO IN SECTION EIGHT FIFTY FOUR AM EIGHT FIFTY FOUR POINT TO PROVIDES A THAT CPUC MUST ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP FROM MANY GAS ELECTRICAL CORPORATION. TO MUNICIPALITY SO I AM -- WANTING SOME ASSURANCES THAT WHETHER IT'S IN A TRAILER BILL OR SOMETHING AND A FUTURE EFFORT THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT. THIS NEW CHANGE THROUGH THIS BILL IS NOT IN ANY WAY GOING TO HAMPER EFFORTS TO MINUTES SUPPLY MUNICIPAL ALLIES WHETHER IT'S FROM A MEET NISA POLITY IN MY DISTRICT OR ANOTHER IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MATTER PRESIDENT I RISE -- FRANKLY RELUCTANTLY AND RESPECTFULLY -- IN OPPOSITION I TO TO THIS LEGISLATION AND I SAY RELUCTANTLY ON BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD IN THIS LEGISLATION. ON A LOT OF REALLY GOOD WORK BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BY AUTHORS I WENT INTO THIS BILL -- AND THIS BILL WILL HAVE BENEFITS FOR REPAIRS ON YOU KNOW THE I KNOW THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE WHO SAY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE A 100%. RESPONSIBLE AND WE NEED TO KNOW AND REPAIRS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEAR ANY OF THE COSTS OF THESE WILDFIRES I WISH THAT WERE TRUE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING -- BUT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WHETHER WE DO NOTHING OR DO SOMETHING. REPAIRS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION -- AND I THINK THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THIS BILL THAT WILL MAKE THINGS-BETTER OP. TIRES ON I ALSO BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE STABILIZE OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THEY ARE UNSTABLE RIGHT NOW AND THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. THAT WILL STABILIZE OUR OHIO USE. MY CONCERN -- AND THE REASON WHY I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND I'M NOT IN ANY WAY CRITICAL OF ANYONE ELSE FOR SUPPORTING A CAUSE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHY THESE ISSUES ARE SO IMPORTANT. IS THAT -- WE ARE IN A TRIAGE SITUATION WITH OUR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WHAT IS A BROKEN MODEL RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF FIRE USING CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE. BUT I THINK WE IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT TO INCLUDE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL TO MOVE US IN THAT DIRECTION -- THE MOST SPECIFICALLY -- I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WAS ADDED INTO THE BILL LAST WEEK -- THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ON MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER -- TO CREATE -- MUNICIPAL UTILITY A PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY WOR FOR A PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND BY ACQUIRING ASSETS FROM AND I OWE YOU -- I YOU KNOW THAT THIS DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE CPU SEES OVERSIGHT AND THE STANDARDS REQUIRED -- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE ACQUISITIONS -- SO AS A RESULT BECAUSE I'M A STRONG BELIEVER -- THAT ARE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES WHETHER WATER POWER CALIFORNIA. I'VE BEEN A VERY POSITIVE FORCE IN THE STATE -- I DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE MODELS FOR A FUTURE WITH A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT -- ELECTRIC SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE IT THIS ONE PROVISION -- IS VERY DETRIMENTAL THAT HAVE -- FOR AND AS A RESULT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'LL BE BRIEF I MENTION THIS MORNING IN COMMITTEE BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE TALK WITH THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILD FIRE VICTIMS AS A CLASS OF PEOPLE OR SOME GENERIC [inaudible] GROUP BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE REAL. I WAS ONE OF THEM IN SOME SMALL RESPECT I'M A RENTER AND I DON'T DESERVE. PUBLIC SYMPATHY BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH A LOT LESS THAN MANY OTHER PEOPLE I STILL HAVE MY LIFE. I LOST THINGS -- BUT I WASN'T BROKEN FINANCIALLY I HAD A FAMILY TO GO -- TO WARM BED TO SLEEP IN -- STILL TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN EVERYTHING BURNS DOWN. AND THAT'S WEIGHED HEAVILY ON MY MIND. THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS IS THAT. I THIS ISN'T JUST POLICY. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR SHOWED UP IN THE ASHES THE WILL THE FIRE. AS A NEWLY ELECTED IN -- THE SHRINE. LEADER AT THE HELP ME SAID I'M A STEP UP AND HELP. WE GOT ACT ON CLIMATE THIS YEAR. AND THAT MEANS DEALING WITH HIS WILD FIRE RISK. AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S FOLLOWED THROUGH ON HIS WORK. AND FOR ALL THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY AND I ONE EIGHT KNOWLEDGE. SERVER SAN FRANCISCO. AND OTHERS HERE WHO ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AND IN OUR INSURANCE COMMITTEES WHO WHO HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S MUCH UNFINISHED BUSINESS. WITH THE INSURANCE NON RENEWALS OCCURRING. WITH THIS SORT OF FEELING A DISEMPOWERMENT THE PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY LIVE IN THIS WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE WITH THEY SAY. WE WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO CONTROL THESE WILDFIRES THAT SACRAMENTO MAKE SOME DECISIONS BUT WE SIT HERE IN THE WE WE POWERLESS. THEY'RE ON A RESPIRATOR LIVING IN A NURSING HOME OR THEY'RE LIVING AMONGST IN A TEN FOOT HIGH MUSTARD PLANTS AND THEY WONDER. HOW'S IT GOING. TO HOW MY GONNA PROTECT MY FAMILY AND MY PROPERTY WHEN THIS HAPPENS AGAIN BECAUSE IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF IT'S MATTER WHEN. SO WITH THAT UNFINISHED BUSINESS WE NEED TO GIVE COMMUNITIES THOSE TOOLS TO HARDEN THEIR HOMES ON A COMMUNITY BASIS. THE USE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THERE'S TE ENERGY IS ATION THAT THEIR POWER DOESN'T GO DOWN IT HURT THEIR HEALTH. OR TURN OFF THE RESPIRATOR OR MAKE THOSE COOLING CENTERS OF THOSE OTHER EVACUATION CENTER SHUT DOWN WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT RISK AND THOSE AREN'T SOLVED IN THIS BILL. SO WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO THIS SESSION ON THIS FRONT. BUT THE REASON I'M RISING IN SUPPORT TODAY'S BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT. ON THIS CRITICAL PIECE THE FORMULA. PEOPLE WILL BE HURT. VICTIMS WILL BE DENIED JUSTICE. IF WE ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO COLLAPSE. AND DENY THEIR CLAIMS AND EXTEND THEM FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND DAYS THOSE OF THOSE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WHO WENT THROUGH TUBS. OR NORTH BAY FOR NAPA THEY'RE STILL WAITING. AND THOSE IN BANKRUPTCY THEY'RE STILL WAITING. BUT ARE VICTIMS OF WAS HE THERE STILL WAITING. SO WE CAN'T WAIT TODAY. AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE DITIONS MADE AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND FROM THE AUTHOR THERE'S A LETTER TO THE JOURNAL PENDING. IT'LL BE COMING BEFORE US LATER THIS WEEK ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE GAPS IN THEIR COMMITMENTS ON IMPLEMENTATION AROUND RESILIENCY AND HARDENING INSURANCE AND DISTRIBUTED. ENERGY RESOURCES ANOTHER SORT OF CRITICAL UPGRADES TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR OUR CIRCUITS TO MAKE SURE THESE EVENTS DON'T SHUT DOWN OUR LIVES AND THEY SET DOWN THE GREED. WITHOUT THIS ACT TODAY WITHOUT THIS AYE VOTE TODAY. WILL FORCE CALIFORNIANS TO WHICH AND THAT JUSTICE DEFERRED CANNOT BE DENIED. SO WITH THAT HEAVY WEIGHT ON OUR SHOULDERS I RISE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. BUT ALSO WITH THE COMMITMENT. THE KEEP SWEATING. AND GO DO THAT WORK. AND GRAIN OURSELVES IN THESE COMMUNITIES. ARE COUNTING ON THANK YOU. SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. WHAT A WAY TO COME BACK FROM AN INDEPENDENCE DAY WEEKEND -- THIS IS A MASSIVE BILL. AND IT IS BEING FAST TRACKED IN SUCH A SHORT TIME. SO I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR GIVING THE DETAILS OF ALL THE PAGES AND ALL THE ISSUES AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE. IMPACTED -- BECAUSE HE JUST CALLED ME A WEEK AGO SUNDAY THEY LET ME KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BILL AND AND HERE WE ARE LITERALLY EIGHT DAYS LATER VOTING ON IT -- AND THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO MAKES A VALID POINT OF BOY WITH A LITTLE MORE TIME FOR A LITTLE MORE DEBATE BE HELPFUL. IN THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE MAJOR REASON I'M HEARING DOING INACTION TODAY IS BECAUSE THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES START THREATENING TO DOWNGRADE THE OTHER TWO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. THIS WOULD POSSIBLY PUT ONE OF THEM. MAYBE BOTH INTO BANKRUPTCY COURT AS WELL [inaudible] OR AT THE LEAST MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM. AFTER BEING DOWNGRADED. TO GOING TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THEY'RE SHORT TERM BORROWING [inaudible] SO. IF IF WE WOULD'VE HAD A LITTLE MORE TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. INTERESTING TO HAVE PROVIDED. AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL. AND DO THE AMENDMENT DRILL AND JUST SIMPLY SAY HEY WHY DON'T WE PROVIDED PROVISION. IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIXTEEN FOR THIRTY WHICH IS. WHICH IS THE CODE SECTION THAT DICK TAKES THE INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT FOR THE STATE TREASURER. AND ALLOW THE STATE TREASURER TO PURCHASE DEBT OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS DEFINED IN SECTION TWO ONE EIGHT OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE. THAT HAVE BEEN RATED BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE [inaudible] SO. I COVER MARCH COUNTY. OUR TREASURE IN DECEMBER NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IS SAYING HEY I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY PORTFOLIO. WE WERE JUST TRANSITIONING. KATHLEEN BROWN WAS TREASURER AND SHE WAS PACKING UP HER OFFICE AND MATT FONG WAS MOVING IN. GOING TO BE SWORN IN. AND WE COULDN'T GET STATE HELP BUT WE JUST ALWAYS WONDER BOY THE STATE TREASURER GONNA STEP THEN. AND MAYBE HELP WE CAN TO HELP OUR PORTFOLIO FOR SIX MONTHS. WE WE MAYBE WOULD NOT HAVE LOST ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ARGUMENT MADE BY MERRILL LYNCH FOR THE LONGEST TIME AND LITIGATION IT WAS CALLED THE WHAT IS SURE TO CUT A STRATEGY BUT IT WAS SAYS SOMETHING THAT WAS -- PROFFERED IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF OUR DELIBERATIONS BUT WE COULDN'T GET. ASSISTANCE FROM A BIG PLAYER THAT HAD A LARGE PORTFOLIO. SAME THING SORT OF HAPPEN IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA FEW YEARS AGO THE COUNTY OF JEFFERSON JEFFERSON COUNTY. FOUND ITSELF -- WITH A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INTEREST RATE SWAP DEAL. AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE MIDDLE OF THE CREDIT CRISIS. AND THEY HAD TO PURCHASE PAPER EVERY WEEK CALL IT A PUT. AND THEY WERE PAYING 15% SOME HIGHER RATES WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO NOW THE STATE TREASURER COULD A JUMPED IN AND PURCHASED. THEIR PUTS THEN THEY COULD AT A SMALL PRMIUM AND SAVE THAT COUNTY A LOT OF MONEY AND IT WOULD HAVE SAVED THE TAXPAYERS BUT INSTEAD JEFFERSON COUNTY HAD TO FILE FOR CHAPTER. NINE BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS WELL SO WITH THAT IDEA IF. IF OUR TREASURE COULD PURCHASE COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM THE I. O. USE -- CHARGE A LITTLE PREMIUM FOR TAKING THE RISK BUT THAT'S A WHOLE LOT LESS THAN WHAT THEY WOULD PAY IN THE OPEN MARKET THAT'S YOU WOULD IN A SENSE. YOU WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WOULD PAY THE TAXPAYERS FOR TAKING ON THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT YOU WOULDN'T. PENALIZE THE RATE PAYERS SO MUCH BY. ARE NOT CHARGING A YOU KNOW AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN OF PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE TIED TO THE HIP. WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THAT DICTATES WHAT RATES ARE SPENT WHAT PRIORITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PURSUED AND WE COULD HAVE A LONG DISCUSSION IF WE HAD THE TIME ON HOW IT COULD HAVE PERHAPS. ACTED DIFFERENTLY SO HERE WE HAVE MAYBE A CHANCE TO BUY SOME TIME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME DISCUSSION. AND EVERYBODY SORT OF WINS WE WOULDN'T BE BEHOLDEN. TO CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AND I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE AND I'VE. TO GET MORE STORIES ABOUT THAT SO I RESPECT ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND IT'S BEEN DONE IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I WILL SAY IT IS A LITTLE RUSHED FOR SOMETHING AS MASSIVE IS THIS AND THERE IS A WAY TO FIND A LITTLE MORE TIME WORKING WITH THE RATING AGENCIES. I'M JUST SORRY THE PERCEIVED IMMEDIACY IS DICTATING THE PACE OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE A FIFTEEN YEAR STRATEGIC FINANCIAL PLAN FROM OUR I USED JUST TO SEE HOW EVERYTHING WOULD PENCIL OUT WORK OUT -- BUT I GUESS I GUESS. I SHOULD BE HAPPY MAYBE STATE GOVERNMENT. CAN ACT QUICKLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. I RISE IN SUPPORT AND I SPEAK VICARIOUSLY THROUGH THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAD TO ONE DOOR THESE FIRES. PARTICULARLY. IN BUTTE COUNTY [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER. SENATOR DOLLY AND I REPRESENT. AND WE HAVE BEEN THERE. SINCE THE FIRE STARTED. IN THE THROES OF THE FIRE. WATCHING THE TERRIFIED EVACUEES. HEARING THEIR STORIES. TALKING TO THEM ON THE CELL PHONES IS A WERE BLOCKED ON THE SKY WAY TRYING TO ESCAPE. OR COMING DOWN ANOTHER BACK WROTE. AND AS I NORMALLY AM RESISTANCE TOWARDS PASSED TRACKING LEGISLATION. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER. I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE JUST VERY ACCURATELY. INDICATED WHY THAT IS SO. BUT NOT THE LEAST IS THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO WERE HORRIFIED? WHO LOST LOVED ONES LOST EVERYTHING THEY HAD? THEY NEED SOME ASSURANCE. THAT THEY WILL GET SOME HELP. THIS OFFERS THEM HELP. I DON'T ARGUE THAT THIS IS A BAILOUT OF GREEDY UTILITIES. THERE ARE MANY PROVISIONS IN HERE. THE HELP CONSTRUCT CONSTRAIN THAT I'M SATISFIED WITH THAT EXCEPT I DON'T LIKE THEM BEING EXEMPTED FROM THE BAGLEY KEENE ACT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER MATTER. YOU WEIGH THE GOOD WITH THE THE NOT SO GOOD. BUT MOST IMPORTANT THERE IS AN URGENCY. TO THOSE CITIZENS. IN THESE FIRE [inaudible] INFLAMED AREAS. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS NOW ABOUT THEIR OWN FUTURES. THAT THEY LOST EVERYTHING THAT THERE IS SOME RELIEF COMING TO THEM THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON THAT THERE WILL BE A REBUILDING. THAT WILL GIVE THEM ASSURANCE. OF A FUTURE. AND VERY PARTICULAR THAT THERE'S A LONG TERM PLAN. THAT WE WILL MINIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF THIS HAPPENING EVER AGAIN. AND NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS ENSURING. A ONGOING PROGRAM. OF MANAGING THE FORCE AND WILD LANDS INSTEAD OF JUST TURNING OUR BACKS ON THEM AS WE DID HERE FOR DECADES IN THIS STATE. WE HAVE NOW HARVESTED THE BANE. OF THAT NEGLECT. WE MUST NOT REPLICATE THAT. AND SOME OF THAT HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE LAST TWO BUDGETS FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE. PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET. THE GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL. THIS GOVERNOR WAS WHETHER FROM THE START. GOING UP. TO THESE FIRES FROM THE GET GO. LOOKING AT RIGHT IN THE EYE. AND AS WE'VE TALKED CENTS MANY TIMES. I KNOW THAT THAT IS IN HIS HEART. AND A SINCERE. ABOUT GETTING CALIFORNIA GOING AGAIN. AND THIS IS INDEED A BIG PART. ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THIS DECADE. HAS BEEN THE WILDFIRES FORMERLY WERE JUST THE AFFLICTION OF THE RURAL AREAS. THE MORE URBANIZED IN SUBURBAN CENTERS. DIDN'T HAVE MUCH PROBLEMS WITH. I REMEMBER THOUGH THE BERKELEY HILLS FIRE THAT COST ONE OF MY FORMER COLLEAGUE SENATOR PETROUS IS HOME THE BERKELEY HILLS. WE ALL GATHERED UP THE BOOKS TO HELP. RESTOCK HIS LIBRARY IN FACT. A TRULY GREAT MAN I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM. BUT WE ARE RALLYING TOGETHER NOW. TO GET OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS BACK ON TRACK AND THEN FOR THE LONG RUN FOR THE GENERATIONS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN. THAT THERE CAN BE A FUTURE THERE FOR THEM. NOT JUST IN THE RURAL AREAS BUT NOW AS WE SEE. THE CATACLYSMIC FIRES. ARE SO GREAT. THEY COME TO VISIT OUR CITIES. THE DRUG DESTROY PARTS OF THE FIRE CAME RIGHT TO THE ROAD THE CITY LIMITS OF RED BLUFF WHERE WE LIVE [inaudible] THAT SUMMER. AS WELL AS INTO READING TO THE NORTH. BUT I USED TO REPRESENT. OUR CITIZENS OF PRAIRIE A VERY DEAR PRICE. AND WE CANNOT. ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE IN A FAIRLY. AND EXTENSIVELY CRAFTED BILL. AND I WOULD SAY CAREFULLY. TO PROTECT AND TO ENSURE. THE BUILT IN CHECKS AND BALANCES. AND DO SOME THINGS NEW. ONE OF THE APPREHENSION SOME OF US COULD HAVE IS INTRIGUING AND AND TRUSTING TO THE P. YOU SEE A VERY TROUBLED AGENCY NEW AUTHORITIES. WELL I DON'T SEE US AS DOING THAT HERE. IN FACT TO THE CONTRARY. NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR WILL APPOINT PEOPLE TO THAT COMMISSION WHO WILL BE COGNIZANT AND SENSITIVE. TO THE AUTHORITIES NOW ACCORDED THE P. YOU SEE AND THESE NEW ENTITIES. RELATED TO MANAGING OUR FUTURE RELATED [inaudible] TO WILDFIRES. IT'S SAD THAT WE HAVE TO SUFFER. SUCH A GREGIS LOSSES. BEFORE WE AWAKEN. AND BECOME PROACTIVE. BUT WE'VE BEEN BLESSED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY NOW. THE FIRES ARE DOWN. OTHERS ARE WAITING TO START AGAIN. LET US HERE NOW GET ABOUT. ATTENDING TO THE FUTURE. I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. GOOD EVENING MADAM PRESIDENT I REVIEWED EVENING I TRY TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND THE FLOOR MANAGER MIGHT SEAT MATE OTHER MEMBERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT MUCH MORE -- TO DO AND THE CALL FOR FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTION AND FORCE MANAGEMENT AND LONG TERM RESILIENCY AND YES AS THE GENTLEMAN FROM SHASTA AND THE GENTLEMAN FROM TAMAR. HAVE A S. STATED WE NEED TO DO MORE AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE'RE ASKING DE I USED TO INVEST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND HARDENING THEIR ASSETS AND THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD NUMBER. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TO LOOK AT AS FAR AS WE LOOK AT NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET ON WHAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT INVESTMENTS WE CAN MAKE. I'D LIKE TO FOR A SECOND TWO APPLIED THE AUTHORS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. ON THE DELICATE BALANCE THAT I THINK THAT THEY'VE REACHED WITH REGARD TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. WHEN FORMER NORMALLY WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TALK ABOUT BANKRUPTCY COURTS USUALLY THERE'S A LOT OF DISPARAGING STATEMENTS THAT MAKE -- MADE WITH PEOPLE THEY TALK HERE IN THE COFFEE HOUSES ABOUT P. GENIES FIND INTO BANKRUPTCY THERE'S ANIMOSITY THERE'S ANGER AND PEOPLE PEOPLE. SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT COME OUT ARE QUITE SELF SERVING STATEMENTS PEOPLE WANT TO CHERRY PICK ASSETS OUT OF A RECOVERING BANKRUPTCY WE HAVE SOME IMPLICIT BIAS THAT WE TALK ABOUT WE LEARN MORE ONE OF THE BIASES WE HAVE ABOUT IS ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO ARE FACED WITH BILLS THAT THEY CAN'T PAY AND TRYING TO REORGANIZE THEMSELVES. AND I THINK WHEN THE FOUNDING SEPARATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT THERE WAS A BALANCE AND I THINK PART OF THE PROVISION THAT WE HAVE HERE. IN THE IN THE BILL THAT INCENTIVIZE IS THE STATE THE I. O. USING P.JEANNIE AND PARTICULARLY. TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FUN SO THAT THEY WILL BE THEY WILL BE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE MONEY AND ALSO THE PAY THESE CLAIMS. IS THE RIGHT BALANCE THAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS THOUGHT THAT THE CITY WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ABOUT THIS COMPLICATED BANKRUPTCY AND A COMPLICATED PARTICULARLY COMPLICATED WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH UTILITIES AND THE IDEA IS THAT. AT LEAST MY READING OF THE BILL IN THE DAYS THAT WE'VE HAD IT IS THAT WE'VE INCENTIVIZE THE DEBTOR TO DO THE RIGHT THING WE'VE INCENTIVIZE WE PROVIDED A PATHWAY FOR THEM TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY BY DOING THE RIGHT THING BY. SPENDING THE MONEY ON HARDENING THEIR ASSETS BUT ALSO. BUT ALSO TO BOMB. PARTICIPATE IN THIS FUN AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN BULLIES AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN -- SECOND GUESSER IS BUT WE SAID THIS IS THE PATHWAY FOR SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA AND SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE IN MY WORLD OF BANKRUPTCY WILL WRITE ABOUT THE ACTIVE THE ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK TODAY. IT'S A SMALL FOOTNOTE IN IN THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE OF THE OF THE BILL BUT I WANTED TO RISE IN SUPPORT AND THANK THE THE AUTHORS FOR PUTTING THOSE THINGS AND THANK YOU SIR Y. CASKEY FOR THAT HISTORY LESSON. SENATOR BATES THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU OF AN A PRESIDENT -- I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF HE'S WILLING. TO TAKE A YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION SENATOR. VERY GOOD ALL RIGHT CENTER BATES -- CERTAINLY AMONG OUR CONSTITUENTS SANDRA OTHERS THERE'S DISTRUST THIS IS A VERY COMPLICATED BILL AND THE QUESTION AT HAND THE CONCERN THAT IS FREQUENTLY PRESENTED TO ME IS THAT THE THIS IS A BAILOUT OF THE UTILITIES I THINK OVER THE LAST HOUR. SEVERAL HOURS OF DEBATE AND DISCUSSION ON IT'S COMING CLEAR THAT THAT'S NOT. REALLY -- SPECIFIC ARE TO THE UTILITIES IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BEING HELPED WITH THIS BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO CLARIFY ON AND IT RELIEVED THAT CONCERN REGARDING WHAT THIS IS OR IS NOT DOING ARE SPECIFICALLY. ARE TO BAIL OUT UTILITIES. WELL TO MY CALLING FROM -- ORANGE COUNTY FIRST OF ALL I WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS IF IT WERE A BAILOUT FOR THE UTILITIES OBVIOUSLY LAST YEAR. AFTER SB NINE OH ONE WE WERE ACCUSED OF HAVING THAT BE A BAIL OUT SO AS WE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT IN -- YOU CERTAINLY WAS NOT BUT NEVER THE LESS THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE -- THAT I RESPECTED BELIEVE THAT IT WAS SO THIS TIME AROUND WE WORKED HARDER WITH THAT STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE LEADERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS WAS CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT A BAIL OUT OF THE UTILITIES. LET ME TELL YOU A FEW THINGS IT DOES NUMBER ONE IT INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SAFETY AND NORMALLY WHEN A UTILITY. INVESTED EVERYTHING THEY GET A RETURN. OF TEN AND A HALF PERCENT THAT JUST BY STATUTE. BUT IN THIS BILL IT DOESN'T ALLOW ANY PROFIT ON ANY OF THAT INVESTMENT. I DID ALSO -- FUNDS A NEW LIABILITY FUND OF WHICH ARE -- UTILITIES ARE PUTTING AND NOW UP FRONT TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. BUT ALSO INVEST UP TO COULD IT AT THE END OF TIME IT INVEST OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS AGAIN WITH NO PROFIT THERE. FOR P. JEANNIE. GETTING OUT OF BANKRUPTCY AND PAYING OFF VICTIMS HAS TO BE. RATE PAYER NEUTRAL LET ME REPEAT RATE PAYER NEUTRAL RATE PAYERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE PAID. AT A PREVIOUS REPAIRS ARE NOT GOING TO PAY. FOR THAT FINALLY -- THE VICTIMS -- I GOT THAT -- I GUESS THERE'S THERE'S OTHER TO TURN AND OTHER REPAIR GROUPS LAST TIME AROUND SB NINE TO ONE BECAUSE OF THAT BELIEVE THAT IT WAS. A REPAIR BILL A BAILOUT THIS MORNING THERE ARE COMMITTEE HEARING LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE THERE THE REPAIR GROUPS. I DID NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL WHICH LAST TIME THEY DID OPPOSE THIS BILL AND THEN FINALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON. WHY THIS IS NOT A UTILITY -- A BAIL OUT IS IT MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN MATTEO IS JUST ABOUT READY TO GET UP AND TESTIFY THAT HE SUPPORTS THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. NO PRESSURE SO IN ORDER HILL BUT THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND AND COLLEAGUES -- I RISE IN SUPPORT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION TODAY AND I DON'T DO THAT LIGHTLY. THIS WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN FOLLOWING P. JEANNIE FOLLOWING OUR UTILITIES FALLING IN OUR PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND WHAT I FOUND WAS A UTILITY THAT WAS. DIVERTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM SAFETY. FROM MAINTENANCE FROM OPERATIONS TO BONUSES EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROFITS. WHAT I SAW WAS A PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION? THE FRANKLY WAS CORRUPT. WHO IS CORRUPTED LEADERSHIP? IT WAS CORRUPT IN THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU DEALT. WITH ITS UTILITIES INCESTUOUS WAS THE RELATIONSHIP A COZY RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY WALKED THE HALLS OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ON A REGULAR BASIS TALKING TO THE STAFF. KEEPING THAT RELATIONSHIP CLOSE. WHICH DIFFICULT TO WATCH. AS I SAW THE POWER OF THOSE YET UTILITIES IN THIS BUILDING. THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT FACED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO LAST YEAR. AFTER THE WILDFIRES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND AS I SAW. SB. NINE OH ONE I DID NOT VOTE FOR THAT LEGISLATION BECAUSE FRANKLY I DID FEEL. IT WAS A BAILOUT. I FELT THAT IT GAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE UTILITIES FOR P. JEANNIE ESPECIALLY [inaudible] THE BENEFIT. TO GET PAID. THE END TO GET RELIEF FROM HAVING TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT TO THE VICTIMS OF THOSE FIRES. I SAW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM I SAW WAS CLEAR. IN A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY. AND NOW AFTER THEY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IT IS MORE A CLEAR POSSIBILITY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE. NO RESOURCES TO COMPENSATE THOSE VICTIMS. THIS LEGISLATION SOLVE A LOT OF THOSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE TO ME THE ISSUE IS WE WANT OUR UTILITIES TO SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO BORROW THOSE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NECESSARY FOR A SOUND UTILITY. END THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT. IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDE STABILITY TO THE MARKETS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT DOES IT IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE RATE PAYERS BECAUSE THAT'S THE LENS WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS LEGISLATION. IS THE LENS TO SEE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE RATE PAYERS ARE NOT PUNISHED. ARE NOT HELD TO A UP A LOWER STANDARD BASICALLY ARE A HIGHER STANDARD DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. IN THOSE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN FIRES. THEY ARE PROTECTED IN THIS. THE BAIL OUT OF NINE OH ONE IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT. BECAUSE P. JEANNIE OR THE RATE PAYERS WE COULD HAVE BEEN HELD. FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY BILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE COST NOW WE'RE NOT. IS THIS LEGISLATION MOVES FORWARD WITH A CAP ON A REPAIR CONTRIBUTION A CAP. OF TEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT WILL GO BEYOND THAT. IN THAT'S THE EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE WE COULD HAVE BEEN SADDLED WITH THIRTY FORTY FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS BUT NOW IT'S TEN POINT FIVE AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL BE THE AMOUNT WE WILL HAVE TO PAY. AT THE END BECAUSE WE'RE NOT OUT OF THAT TEN AND A HALF BILLION GOING TO PAY. FOR THOSE VICTIMS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT WILL COME FROM P. JEANNIE AND IT SHOULD COME FROM PGA. I WAS IMPRESSED WHEN I SAW THE ORIGINAL [inaudible] BILL. WHEN THIS BILL CAME FORWARD AND WAS EXPLAINED HADN'T READ IT YET BUT IT LOOKS GOOD? IT SOUNDED GOOD. THEN IN THE DETAILS THERE WERE SOME CHALLENGES CHALLENGES WITH LIABILITY HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE DEFINED TO PROTECT US AS WE GO FORWARD AS THOSE FIRES WILL COME AS WE WILL SEE. AND HOW WE DEFINE WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR THOSE AT THE END. AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF WHO DID AN OUTSTANDING EXTRAORDINARY JOB. IN REACHING OUT COMMUNICATING IN TRYING TO TO CREATE A AND CRAFT A SOLUTION OF WORDS. IN THOSE WORDS MEAN SOMETHING IN THIS LEGISLATION AS IT GOES. FOR AS WE DEFINE RESPONSIBILITY AS WE DESPITE DEFINED REPAIR RESPONSIBILITY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AS WE DEFINED UTILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY. THIS BILL DID THAT IN DOES IT TODAY. THE IDEA OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE LEGISLATION ON EIGHT YEARS AGO. AFTER THE FIRE IN SAN BRUNO THE GAS EXPLOSION KILLED EIGHT PEOPLE. AND THE C. E. O. OF P. JEANNIE PETER DARBY LEFT THAT COMPANY WITH A TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS GOLDEN PARACHUTE. TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WON'T HAPPEN WITH THIS LEGISLATION. WILL BE PROTECTED FROM THAT. AND WE WON'T SEE THAT. AS REPAIRS ARE PROTECTED LIABILITY GOING FORWARD WILL BE FAIR. IF THOSE UTILITIES BECAUSE THEIR NEGLIGENCE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY CAUSES THAT FIRE THEY'RE GOING TO PAY. IF IT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IF IT'S THOUGHT NOT IF THEY HAVEN'T DONE AND RECEIVE THEIR CERTIFICATE THEIR SAFETY% CERTIFICATION AND IT IS AS THIS BILL NOW DOES. IT WILL BE MONITORED IT WILL BE INSPECTED IT WILL BE AUDITED IT WILL BE ANNUALLY CERTIFY RECERTIFIED IT'LL BE CHECKED ON A REGULAR BASIS IF THEY MEET THAT STANDARD. IT'S A HIGH STANDARD IF THEY MEET THAT STANDARD AND SOMETHING HAPPENS. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT. AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY. AND WE SHOULD SHARE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. BECAUSE AND SOCIALIZE THAT COST BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THOSE WIRES WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT ELECTRICITY. AND WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIABILITY WHEN I LOOK AT THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION WHEN I LOOK AT THE REPAIR PROTECTION. IN A LOOK AT THE VICTIMS BEING PAID. I THINK THIS LEGISLATION AND I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR I REALLY DO. BECAUSE HE TOOK THIS ON IN JANUARY HE TOOK AROUND PROBABLY BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED AFTER THE FIRES IN OCTOBER WHEN HE THOUGHT HE KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE. AND HE HAS WHAT I BELIEVE IS A HISTORY. WHERE HE COMES FROM FRANKLY OF P. JEANNIE? HE KNEW AND KNOWS THE TYPE OF COMPANY THAT THEY WERE. AND HE IS PROTECTING THE RATE PAYERS IN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THAT COMPANY TODAY AND MAKING THEM PAY IN THE END. AND FOR THAT I'M THANKFUL AND THANKFUL TO HAVE STAFF. THE FOR ALL THOSE REASONS MATTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I'M SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION TODAY. IT WAS NOT EASY FROM THE START. BUT IT'S EASY RIGHT NOW I ASK FOR YOUR I'VE. THANK YOU SENATOR HILL. SENATOR ATKINS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IT IS BEEN A VERY. SEEMINGLY LONG DAY ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW HOURS REALLY. MOSTLY I I STOOD UP I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WHAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SPENT -- ACTUALLY -- DAYS WEEKS AND IN SOME CASES -- THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WORKING ON THIS. I JUST WANTED TO ADD MY THANKS TO OUR MAJORITY LEADER MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN MATTEO -- MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO WHO CHAIRS THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES WHO STOOD UP AND TOLD PERSONAL STORIES OF SACRIFICE THEMSELVES. AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY AND FAMILY MEMBERS. IF ONLY WE HAD LOOKED AT THIS A DECADE AGO WHEN MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO AND MY SEVERAL COLLEAGUES FROM SAN DIEGO. AND I WITNESSED TWO FIRES IN OUR COUNTY THAT WERE DEVASTATING. THAT WITHOUT A LOT OF CONVERSATION DISCUSSION THAT. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY I HAD TO FIGHT ITS WAY BACK AND FIGURE OUT HOW IT WAS GOING TO PROVIDE -- ENERGY TO OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. AND SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THEY HAVE PUT IN PLACE -- NOW SPOKEN OF ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS STATE OF THE ART. WELL THEY DID THAT OUT OF NECESSITY AN OUT OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ENERGY. TO US IN OUR COUNTY IF THEY WEREN'T PREPARED TO DEAL WITH WILD FIRES. AND SO WE WANT TO SEE THAT REPLICATED ASA AND THEY STAND ON THE VERGE OF ACTUALLY FACING. THE DOWNGRADING THAT ARE A GOOD FRIEND FROM ORANGE COUNTY TALKED ABOUT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IN THE LAST DECADE. THEY WORK TO IMPROVE AND YET THEY STAND TO LOSE ALL THAT THEY'VE OBTAINED IT GAINED. ODD BECAUSE OF IT. ALL OF THE REASONS TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION MY ELOQUENT COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED. THIS IS ABOUT RATE PAYERS THIS IS ABOUT FIRE VICTIMS THIS IS ABOUT COLLEAGUES WHO HAD TO PUT. HOURS OF THOUGHT INTO WHAT IT MEANS TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THIS IS ABOUT ARGUING WITH OURSELVES HAVE WE DONE ENOUGH. ARE WE ARE WE TAKING A RISK HERE. THAT WE'RE AFRAID MAY NOT PRODUCE WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO. ALL OF THOSE FEARS MAKE US WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK I KNOW. BUT SHOULD WE NOT ACT. THE DAMAGE DONE GOING FORWARD WOULD BE MUCH MUCH MORE SEVERE. AND WE IN OUR FEAR WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO CALIFORNIA. SO IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE COME TOGETHER BAND TOGETHER AND DO THIS WORK KNOWING THAT OUR WORK IS NOT DONE OF COURSE IT IS NOT DONE. CITIES AND COUNTIES NEED TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF HARDENING IN THEIR VERY. ODD COMMUNITIES IN THAT EXTENDS NOT JUST -- TO TO DEALING WITH -- THE GROWTH IN THE FUEL -- IS IT AROUND OUR HOMES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS BUT ALSO -- EVEN MORE THAN THAT -- ZONING ORDINANCES AND THINGS THAT PROVIDE FUEL LIKE SHAKES SHINGLE ROOFS AND THINGS THAT MY COLLEAGUE AND I FROM SAN DIEGO HAD TO ADDRESS A DECADE AGO AND PEOPLE WERE NOT HAPPY. AND THEY WOULD THEY WERE A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE IN THE CITY THE BIG CITY OF SAN DIEGO BUT LET ME TELL YA. I STILL HAVE THE PICTURE OF ME HOLDING THE NEWSPAPER. AND THE SKY BEHIND US WAS SO RED BECAUSE OF THE FIRES. AND THE DATE ON THE NEWSPAPER YOU COULD SEE. ARM YOU KNOW THOSE ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES THAT HOPEFULLY FORCE US TO TAKE MORE ACTION. THAN WE HAVE HAD THE LUXURY NOT TO TAKE UP UNTIL NOW SO I COMMEND ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE REALLY. DONE THE HARD WORK THE INTERNAL. DEBATE THE DEBATE WITH EACH OF US TO GET WHERE WE ARE TODAY IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE NOT TO TAKE ACTION I URGE YOU.
