REFER TO IT MUCH OF NOW ON. IS

00:39:26.397 --> 00:39:29.901 region:rollup2
THE MEANS BY WHICH A GOVERNMENT

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:31.603 region:rollup2
AGENCIES INCLUDING CALTRANS NOT

00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:33.071 region:rollup2
JUST CALTRANS BY ANY GOVERNMENT

00:39:31.603 --> 00:39:34.439 region:rollup2
AGENCY THAT DEALS WITH BILLING

00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:36.541 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:38.910 region:rollup2
ASSIGNS INDIRECT COSTS TO

INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.247 region:rollup2
INDIRECT COSTS OF THOSE COSTS

00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:43.681 region:rollup2
WHICH CANNOT EASILY BE ASSIGNED

00:39:42.247 --> 00:39:45.116 region:rollup2
TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS BECAUSE

THERE'S NO CLEAR CONNECTION TO

THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT.

00:39:46.718 --> 00:39:48.453 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:49.988 region:rollup2
CONSIDER TO BE OVERHEAD IS THE

00:39:48.453 --> 00:39:51.890 region:rollup2
COMMON PARLANCE IT'S NOT

00:39:49.988 --> 00:39:52.423 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PROJECT.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:54.225 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THE COST OF DOING

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:55.693 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:57.262 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF ASSIGNING THESE

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:59.998 region:rollup2
COST TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS IS

00:39:57.262 --> 00:40:01.633 region:rollup2
TO THE IS TWO FOLD ONE. IS TO BE

00:39:59.998 --> 00:40:03.067 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CAPTURE THE TRUE COST OF

00:40:01.633 --> 00:40:04.869 region:rollup2
DOING THE WORK.

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:06.104 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND IS TO BE ABLE TO

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:08.006 region:rollup2
RECOVER THOSE FULL COSTS ON

00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:09.340 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WOMEN WERE

00:40:08.006 --> 00:40:11.676 region:rollup2
BEING REIMBURSED BY OTHERS WHO

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.845 region:rollup2

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:18.483 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS.

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:21.319 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CALCULATED BASED ON

00:40:18.483 --> 00:40:22.754 region:rollup2
FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE ICRP

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:24.389 region:rollup2
RATE IS APPROVED BOTH BY THE

FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.859 region:rollup2
IN OUR CASE.

00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:29.327 region:rollup2
OTHER GUYS STATE AND LOCAL

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:30.628 region:rollup2
AGENCIES WOULD HAVE THEIR RATE

00:40:29.327 --> 00:40:32.764 region:rollup2
APPROVED BY THEIR APPROPRIATE

00:40:30.628 --> 00:40:34.098 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AGENCY.

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:35.800 region:rollup2
ARE CALTRANS RATE IS BASED ON

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:37.335 region:rollup2
TWO SEPARATE COMPONENTS THE

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.903 region:rollup2
FIRST IS THE. FUNCTIONAL

00:40:37.335 --> 00:40:40.271 region:rollup2
OVERHEAD RATE OF THE FUNCTIONAL

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:41.439 region:rollup2
ICRP RATE.

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.807 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:44.742 region:rollup2
THE LARGER OF THE TWO RATES AND

00:40:42.807 --> 00:40:46.644 region:rollup2

SUCH IS THE COSTS OF TRAINING

00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:53.251 region:rollup2

SUPERVISION OF THOSE EMPLOYEES.

00:40:57.221 --> 00:41:00.558 region:rollup2

OVERHEAD COSTS IS THE

ADMINISTRATIVE ICRP RATE.

00:41:02.794 --> 00:41:04.963 region:rollup2
WHICH REFLECT THE COST OF

00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:13.171 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES THE COSTS

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.572 region:rollup2

AND THE LARGEST PIECE OF THAT

00:41:22.447 --> 00:41:27.552 region:rollup2
IS CALTRAIN SHARE OF.

00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:28.953 region:rollup2

DOING BUSINESS IN IT'S A COST TO

00:41:32.557 --> 00:41:37.995 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH THE ICRP WERE ABLE TO

00:41:34.459 --> 00:41:39.797 region:rollup2
ASSIGN TO INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:40.832 region:rollup2
AND THE RATES ARE APPLIED TO THE

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:42.633 region:rollup2
PAYROLL.

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:44.902 region:rollup2
COSTS ON A PROJECT SO WHEN WE

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:46.304 region:rollup2
CHARGE STAFF TIME TO OTHERS

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:47.905 region:rollup2
THOSE RATES ARE APPLIED ONLY IN

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:50.041 region:rollup2
THAT CASE IT'S A PERCENTAGE OF

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:51.976 region:rollup2
THE STAFF COSTS.

00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:54.512 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S FULL COST RECOVERY

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:56.414 region:rollup2
POLICY REQUIRES US TO PRINT TO

00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:57.482 region:rollup2
THE CHARGE BOTH OF THESE TWO

00:41:56.414 --> 00:41:58.583 region:rollup2
RATES TO THE PROJECTS GOING TO

00:41:57.482 --> 00:42:00.084 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:02.353 region:rollup2
AND LESS IT'S OTHERWISE

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:04.122 region:rollup2
SPECIFIED IN LAW AND YOUR STAFF

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:06.090 region:rollup2
A WRITE UP IDENTIFIES THE VERY

00:42:04.122 --> 00:42:07.625 region:rollup2
FEW INSTANCES WHERE THERE IS AN

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.560 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION IN LAW WHO WE DON'T

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:10.661 region:rollup2
CHARGE EITHER ONE OR BOTH OF

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.330 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO. TWO COMPONENTS.

00:42:10.661 --> 00:42:14.165 region:rollup2
.

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:16.467 region:rollup2
I CRP REIMBURSEMENTS BY THESE

00:42:14.165 --> 00:42:17.902 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT ARE DEFRAY SOME OF

00:42:16.467 --> 00:42:20.238 region:rollup2
THE COSTA CALTRANS OF DOING THIS

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:22.273 region:rollup2
BUSINESS IN PROPORTION TO THE

00:42:20.238 --> 00:42:24.208 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE PERFORM FOR THEM.

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:25.410 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF THE

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.044 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS IS THAT A AYE

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.012 region:rollup2
ONCE A RELATIVELY MINOR BUT IN

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.747 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF SELF HELP COUNTIES

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:31.616 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:32.050 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:42:31.616 --> 00:42:34.352 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.585 region:rollup2
ANNA APPLIES TO MUCH OF THE

00:42:34.352 --> 00:42:36.921 region:rollup2
GREATER.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:37.488 region:rollup2
.

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.090 region:rollup2
NO CHARGE FOR THE WORK BEING

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:40.224 region:rollup2
PERFORMED.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.427 region:rollup2
SO THIS ESSENCE BASICALLY

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:44.629 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE TRUE COST OF DOING

00:42:42.427 --> 00:42:45.129 region:rollup2
BUSINESS THE TRUE COSTS OF OF OF

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:46.431 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING EMPLOYEES AT

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:48.332 region:rollup2
CALTRANS.

00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:49.367 region:rollup2
AND IT'S AGAIN ONLY FOR THE

00:42:48.332 --> 00:42:51.602 region:rollup2
DIRECT LABOR BEING PERFORMED ON

00:42:49.367 --> 00:42:53.037 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.539 region:rollup2
WE'VE READ THE STAFF

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:21.199 region:rollup2
HOW MANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

AS THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:05.710 region:rollup2
THERE'S A. LACK OF CONSISTENCY

00:44:04.175 --> 00:44:07.311 region:rollup2
IN HOW ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.614 region:rollup2

CALTRANS.

00:44:18.723 --> 00:44:22.126 region:rollup2
IF CALTRANS HAD THE MONEY TO BE

DOING THAT PROJECT WE VIEW THE

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:25.630 region:rollup2
SELF HELP COUNTIES AS A STRONG

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:27.431 region:rollup2
PARTNER. AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.333 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO BUILD THE SELF

HELP COUNTIES FOR COSTS THAT ARE

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:33.004 region:rollup2

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:42.880 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE APPROPRIATE BUT WHEN

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:44.048 region:rollup2
THERE ARE. OUTSIDE COSTS OF

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.249 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT WE DON'T THINK THE

LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:27.034 region:rollup2
AND BUT ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:28.102 region:rollup2
JUST DEALING WITH THESE CRITICAL

01:48:27.034 --> 01:48:30.537 region:rollup2
REPAIRS TO LEVEES.

01:48:28.102 --> 01:48:32.006 region:rollup2
.

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:33.607 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW BY HAVING THIS

01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:35.409 region:rollup2
ANNUAL APPROPRIATION WE CAN

01:48:33.607 --> 01:48:36.643 region:rollup2
REALLY START TO GET AT SOME OF

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:38.345 region:rollup2
THE. YOU KNOW THE MOST

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:39.313 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC AREAS UP AND DOWN

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:41.015 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

01:48:39.313 --> 01:48:42.750 region:rollup2
NEAR THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:48:41.015 --> 01:48:44.151 region:rollup2
CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:45.753 region:rollup2
PLAN IDENTIFIED.

01:48:44.151 --> 01:48:47.054 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO INVEST SEVENTEEN TO

01:48:45.753 --> 01:48:49.089 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE BILLION OVER THE NEXT

01:48:47.054 --> 01:48:50.024 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEARS.

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:51.392 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER THAT'S

01:48:50.024 --> 01:48:52.493 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

01:48:51.392 --> 01:48:54.061 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF CAPITAL

01:48:52.493 --> 01:48:54.795 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:48:54.061 --> 01:48:57.197 region:rollup2
BUT I LOOK AT THIS HUNDRED

01:48:54.795 --> 01:48:58.966 region:rollup2
MILLION AS JUST YOUR BASIC ANA.

01:48:57.197 --> 01:49:00.534 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

01:48:58.966 --> 01:49:01.101 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE WE NEED TO

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:02.503 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT'S BEING TAKEN

01:49:01.101 --> 01:49:04.004 region:rollup2
CARE OF.

01:49:02.503 --> 01:49:05.906 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT I PROPOSES

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:07.408 region:rollup2
EITHER A CONTINUOUS ONE HUNDRED

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:09.243 region:rollup2
MILLION OR IF THAT'S SOMETHING

01:49:07.408 --> 01:49:10.744 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. AT LEAST

01:49:09.243 --> 01:49:12.179 region:rollup2
MAYBE DOING A ONE TIME FOUR

01:49:10.744 --> 01:49:13.881 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

01:49:12.179 --> 01:49:16.116 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATION THIS YEAR.

01:49:13.881 --> 01:49:18.385 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE BACKLOG THERE'S

01:49:16.116 --> 01:49:20.254 region:rollup2
IT AND NDW ARE HAS TESTIFIED

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:21.889 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A HUGE BACKLOG IN

01:49:20.254 --> 01:49:23.023 region:rollup2
REPAIRS THAT NEED TO GET. AT

01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:24.858 region:rollup2
THAT NEED TO GET DONE.

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:26.026 region:rollup2
SEVERAL HOT HOT SPOTS ALL

THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:30.197 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A LARGER ISSUE THAN

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:32.132 region:rollup2
JUST ONE COUNTY OR ONE DISTRICT

01:49:30.197 --> 01:49:34.334 region:rollup2
THIS AFFECTS ALL CALIFORNIA.

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:36.103 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FORMED IN THE ASSEMBLY.

01:49:34.334 --> 01:49:37.304 region:rollup2

SIGNED ON TO.

01:49:47.347 --> 01:49:50.818 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET REQUEST.

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:53.253 region:rollup2
BY MAKING THIS INVESTMENT NOW

01:49:50.818 --> 01:49:54.655 region:rollup2
WE CAN SAVE LIVES PROPERTY. AND

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:56.023 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAVE THE

01:49:54.655 --> 01:49:57.257 region:rollup2
STATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH

01:49:56.023 --> 01:49:58.192 region:rollup2
IS ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:59.860 region:rollup2
POINT OUT BECAUSE OF THE

01:49:58.192 --> 01:50:02.029 region:rollup2
PATERNAL CASE.

01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:03.997 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS BACK THE STATE IS

01:50:02.029 --> 01:50:06.233 region:rollup2
LIABLE IF ONE OF THESE LEVEES

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:07.801 region:rollup2
BREAKS AND CAUSES DAMAGE TO

01:50:06.233 --> 01:50:09.069 region:rollup2
LIVES AND PROPERTY. I'M A

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:10.904 region:rollup2

01:50:12.072 --> 01:50:15.342 region:rollup2
UNDER THE PATERNAL CASE.

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:16.477 region:rollup2
THAT BELIEVE THE NUMBER THERE

01:50:15.342 --> 01:50:18.412 region:rollup2
WAS SOME AROUND FOUR HUNDRED

01:50:16.477 --> 01:50:20.080 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS THE

01:50:18.412 --> 01:50:21.114 region:rollup2
STATE WAS FOUND LIABLE FOR.

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:22.683 region:rollup2
IF IT HAPPENS TODAY WE'RE

01:50:21.114 --> 01:50:24.485 region:rollup2
TALKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

01:50:22.683 --> 01:50:26.687 region:rollup2
WE CAN POTENTIALLY BE LIABLE FOR

01:50:24.485 --> 01:50:27.688 region:rollup2
SO. MAKING AN INVESTMENT NOW

01:50:26.687 --> 01:50:28.856 region:rollup2
