THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO RISK THEIR HEALTH AND POSSIBLY THEIR LIFE TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE. YEAH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW ON APRIL SEVENTH SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR WHEN WISCONSINITES WERE FORCED TO VOTE IN PERSON IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION STANDING FOR HOURS IN LINES THAT STRETCH FOR MILES. DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS OF ELECTIONS OFFICIALS THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WHO REQUESTED ABSENTEE BALLOTS DID NOT RECEIVE THEM IN TIME TO VOTE IN RETURN THE BY ELECTION DAY. THEY WERE EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISED. THIS IS WHY I'VE INTRODUCED AB EIGHT SIXTY WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED CALIFORNIA VOTER EMAIL THE BALLOT FOR THIS NOVEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTION. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA VOTER HAS THE OPTION TO VOTE FROM THE SAFETY OF THEIR OWN HOME. AB EIGHT SIXTY MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT ACCOMMODATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE THE EXPECTED SURGE IN VOTING. BY MAIL AT THIS NOVEMBER'S ELECTION. IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO BEGIN PROCESSING RETURN VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS EARLIER SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR WORKLOAD TO GET MORE BALLOTS COUNTED ON ELECTION NIGHT. AND IT EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR SEAT VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS SO THAT VOTERS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED BY POTENTIAL POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS. IT ALLOWS ALL VOTERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FLEXIBILITY OFFERED BY MY REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR VOTERS WHO NEED REPLACEMENT BALLOTS. OR WHO WANT TO RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THEIR PREFERREDLANGUAGE. FINALLY AB IT SIXTEEN STORES THAT ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR BALLOTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE MAIL SYSTEM AND ARE PROCESSED BY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. AB EIGHT SIXTY IS SUPPORTED BY MORE THAN TWO DOZEN CALIFORNIA ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. AS WELL AS MY SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX PADILLA. IT HAD BOUGHT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND WAS APPROVED UNANIMOUSLY IN THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS WEEK. THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN MR LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANISTIQUE REMEMBERS I RISE TO. GIVE A SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION TO THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THE CHAIR OF THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AS WE ALL KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS INTRODUCED THE INTRODUCED THIS BILL AND THIS LEGISLATION BACK IN APRIL TWO WHICH THEN THE MINISTRATION SUBSEQUENTLY IN. IT'S TO THE- POINTS ARE THIS RECEIPT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE WHICH GOES TO SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING DEMOCRACY AND ACTION AND RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU MISTER LOWE MISTER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THE SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS THAT I REMAIN TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THE BILL I INCLUDING WHETHER THE RIGHT SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE OF HOW WORKABLE IS FOR OUR COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICES BUT I APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS. OF THE AUTHOR TO HAVE A DIALOGUE ON THIS AND THE WORK OF THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE NO LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS PERFECT IN OUR PARTICULAR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS ESPECIALLY IN PERECT BUT IT SURE BEATS NO PROCESS AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THIS BILL- MAKE IT TO THE DESK OF THE GOVERNOR. TO ASSURE THAT OUR ELECTION IN NOVEMBER IS CONDUCTED IN A WAY THAT IS SAFE. IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES THE FULLEST MEASURE OF ACCESS TO EVERY CALIFORNIA VOTER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT SIXTY. AS WE JUST HAD THIS BILL IN OUR COMMITTEE IN THE ELECTIONS A REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS WEEK- I WANT TO FIRST COMMEND THE AUTHOR WHO YOU KNOW HAS WHO STARTED HIS BACK IN APRIL- YOU KNOW WORKING ON THIS PIECE OF A LESS. OF LEGISLATION OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZING THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH KOBE NINETEEN AND THINKING ABOUT OUR ELECTIONS PROCESS. TAKING TAKING INPUT. I HAVE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM ROCK AND IT'S NOT A PERFECT BILL THERE'S THINGS IN HERE I AM. THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- BUT I ONE OF THINGS I WANT TO NOTICES THE AUTHOR. TOOK AMENDMENTS TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT NO IN ACTIVE- NO INACTIVE VOTER WOULD RECEIVE A MAIL BALLOT WHICH I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION. HAD IT IS. IT IS PART OF CURRENT LAW BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE THAT NEEDED TO BE CLARIFIED. ANOTHER THING THAT'S IN HERE THAT THE ACTUALLY WASN'T IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS. IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR COUNTIES TO USE THEIR OWN TRACKING SYSTEM. THAT THEY ARE NOT FORCED TO USE ONLY THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S TRACKING SYSTEM. NOW THAT'S COMES FROM INPUT. THAT WE RECEIVED. FROM COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND GOES TO ANOTHER POINT OF WHY IT'S IMPORTANT AT THE LEGISLATURE. DOES THIS WORK. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. THESE THINGS ARE NOT DONE BY AN EXECUTIVE ORDER CHANGING ELECTIONS CODES AND STATUTES- UNILATERALLY BUT RATHER THE LEGISLATURE IS THE ONE THAT NEEDS TO DO THIS WORK. AND I THINK THIS PROCESS THE SHOW NOT ONLY THAT- WELL IT IS THE DUTY FREE FIRST AND FOREMOST AND IT IS OUR LEGISLATIVE POWERS- CONSIST WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE POWERS TO DO THIS- BUT IT SHOWS THAT WE CAN ACT. QUICKLY OUT THIS IS BEING PASSED ON URGENCY BECAUSE AND WE ARE BEING ABLE TO DO THIS AND GIVE DIRECTION TO OUR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. ON HOW WE CAN CONDUCT. AN ELECTION SAFELY- BUT ALSO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY. OF THAT ELECTION A LONG TERM ONE MORE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT IS. ANOTHER THING THIS BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT. BALLOTS THAT ARE COMING IN AFTER THE ELECTION DO GO THROUGH A VETTING PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE. IN FACT CAST. HONOR BEFORE ELECTION DAY THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION. OTHERS PUT INTO THIS BILL. AND SO WITH ALL THESE THINGS AGAIN IT SHOWS THAT. YES INDEED THE LEGISLATURE DOES WORK- AND THAT WE CAN. AND TODAY WILL- ACT. TO ENSURE SAFE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND WE DO NOT NEED THE EXECUTIVE. TO A SERVE OUR AUTHORITY AND PASS- EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN ADVANCE OF US THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER LARGER AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER BERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MADAM SPEAKER IN JUST WILL APPRECIATE THE CALM IN THE THIS THAT I'VE RECEIVED FROM MANY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM pNICHOLAS AND ROCK WINNING CAMPBELL- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO TRY TO IDENTIFY ANY OF THE POTENTIAL- ISSUES THAT OUR ELECTION SYSTEM MY FACE IN NOVEMBER AND GET AHEAD OF IT AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR- ELECTIONS CLERKS. I HAVE THE TIME. TAKEN DR URBAN. IMPORTANT ELECTION DURING IT REMARKABLY UNIQUE TIMES- SO REALLY APPRECIATE THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS. BILL AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN THE CLERK WILLOPEN THE ROLE. ALL MEMBERS GO THERE TO THE- ALL MEMBERS VOTE WHO DESERVE A- ON MEMBERS VOTED TO THEIR TO. ALL MEMBERS THIRTY A. OKAY YEAH. WHERE WILL CLOSE THE ROLE TALLIED VOTES AYES SIXTY THREE NO TO ANY URGENCY I SIXTEEN THREE NO TO SEND AMENDMENTS COMPARED IN. MEMBERS WITHOUT OBJECTION WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM FIFTEEN AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN THE CLERK WILL READ. SOME PEOPLE THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA OTHERS AN ACCOLADE TO IMPLEMENT MAKING AN APPROPRIATION OR FOR. MR COLOR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN WHICH PROVIDES NECESSARY LEAVE AND JOB PROTECTION TO PROMOTE HEALTHY WORKPLACES AND TO PROTECT THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THIS GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND IN FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. OVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS THE STATE IS DEVOTED HIMSELF TO HELPING BEND THE CURVE AND REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THIS VOTE THAT THAT THIS VIRUS IS HAVING ON OUR COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA IT'S COUNTIES AND CITIES A LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF MAKE GREAT SACRIFICES TO PROVIDE FOR THE OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH. WHAT THIS VIRUS HAS DEMONSTRATED IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEAVE AND WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO ADDRESS AND RESPOND TO THIS AND OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. THIS BILL IS A REFLECTION OF THE REAL TIME NEEDS IMPOSED BY COVER NINETEEN. IT EXPANDS ACCESS TO UNPAID JOB PROTECTED LEAVE HELPING TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYEES CAN STAY HOME IF THEY OR A LOVED ONE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY COVERT NINETEEN I'M NOT PLACE OTHERS AT GREATER RISK OF TRANSMISSION. THAT ALSO MINIMALLY EXPANDS NEEDED PAID SICK LEAVE AND LIMITS ACCESS TO A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR WORKERS TO MEET THE TWO WEEK MANDATORY QUARANTINE PERIOD TO FURTHER PROTECT THEMSELVES THEIR COWORKERS AND THE GREATER PUBLIC HEALTH. IT WOULD ALSO HELP ENSURE THE ECONOMY IS READY TO RE OPEN OF THE LIFE BLOOD OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY IT'S WORKERS CAN GET BACK TO WORK QUICKLY AND SAFELY TO THE STATUS OF A RITE OF RETENTION. KALRA NINETEEN IS MAGNIFIED THE INEQUITIES ABOUT LEAVE LAWS WHICH HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE RECENTLY ADOPTED. FEDERAL FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS ACT EXCLUDING OVER TWELVE MILLION WORKERS FROM ACCESSING THE FEDERAL PAID SICK LEAVE PROGRAM. AS A RESULT FAR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND WOMEN. PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES DURING THIS TIME. ARE FACING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN WORKING WHILE SICK OR LOSING THE INCOME THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS INDUSTRIES SUCH AS HOTELS AIRPORT HOSPITALITY ADVANCERS CENTERS AND BUILDING SERVICES HAVE LAID OFF ONE THIRD OR MORE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. WORKERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES ARE OVERWHELMINGLY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IMMIGRANTS AND WOMEN. WHO ARE ALREADY ECONOMICALLY AND PHYSICALLY GETTING HIT HARDEST BY COVERT NINETEEN AS THE DATA IS SHOWING US ALL TOO CLEARLY. THESE WORKERS OF LOST THEIR JOBS BECAUSE OF SOMETHING COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR CONTROL NOT BECAUSE OF POOR PERFORMANCE OR DISCIPLINE BECAUSE OF A CRISIS NOT OF THEIR MAKING. THESE WORKERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR JOBS WHEN THE CRISIS HAS ENDED. AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS TAKEN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. I WILL CONTINUE. TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO MAKE REASONABLE AMENDMENTS AND IN FACT HAVE HAVE COMMITTED AND WILL COMMIT TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PAID SICK LEAVE DAYS FROM SEVEN TO THREE DAYS. ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION OF COLLEAGUES TO HAVE CONCERNS ON ISSUES OF A RITE OF ATTENTION AND RECALL I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ARE LEGITIMATE I SHARE THOSE SAME CONCERNS. AND I WILL COMMIT TO. NOT JUST MAKE THE AMENDMENTS ON THE PAID SICK LEAVE. OF THE DAYS BUT TO CONTINUE TO WORK. SO THAT WE CAN FIND THE BALANCE OF I WILL ALSO MAKE IT A MINUTE SORRY THAT ALL EXAM BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED DURING AN EMERGENCY- BUT I ALSO WORK TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE UNDUE BURDENS ON BUSINESS. BUT I WANT TO ALSO ENSURE THAT THE PRINCIPLES ARE PROTECT OUR WORK ALSO REMAIN IN PLACE THE BALANCE IS DIFFICULT TO FIND BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN FIND IT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PAID SICK LEAVE. DAYS I BELIEVE IS GOES A LONG WAY FINDING THAT BALANCE. ULTIMATELY WE MUST ALLOW EMPLOYEES IMPACTED BY KOBE NINETY TO RECOVER AWAY FROM WORK WITHOUT FEAR OF RISKING THEIR EMPLOYMENT OR PLACING THEIR COWORKERS ARREST. THEY ARE DOING WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH REQUIRES AND DEMANDS OF THEM. LET'S NOT PUNISH THEM FURTHER. WE MUST ALSO LOOK TO THE FUTURE AND IMPLEMENT LONG TERM POLICIES THAT WILL HELP GET PEOPLE TO A CRISIS LIKE THIS USER WE DON'T WANT TO KEEP. THROUGH THIS TIME THERE'S AN EMERGENCY FIGURING OUT HOW TO STRIKE THIS PROPER BALANCE. WE CANNOT WAIT AND WE MUST NOT WAIT ON A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISS REST YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ARISES PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB THREE THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN. THIS BILL PROVIDES NECESSARY JOB PROTECTIONS TO TWELVE MILLION WORKERS LEFT OUT OF THE FEDERAL SICK LEAVE PROGRAM. THIS PANDEMIC IS HIGHLIGHTED THE INEQUALITIES OF OUR ECONOMY AND OUR EMPLOYMENT LAWS. YES WE'RE STILL IN A PANDEMIC WE'RE STILL TRYING TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE AND MINIMIZE CONTACT WITH OTHERS. THIS PANDEMIC HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LOW INCOME WORKERS PHYSICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY. AS OF YESTERDAY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTED ONE HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY NINE CASES OF COVERT NINETEEN IN CALIFORNIA. OF THAT NUMBER 600-003-0070 SEVEN REPORTED CASES. 56% OF THE CALL WOULD NINETEEN CASES IN CALIFORNIA AFFECTED MEMBERS OF THE LATIN NEXT COMMUNITY. LOW WAGE WORKERS MAKE UP. OVER WORKERS PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS AND WOMEN ARE FACING THE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICE BETWEEN WORKING WHILE SICK OR LOSING THE INCOME THEY RELY ON TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN WOULD ALLOW THESE WORKERS TO STAY HOME WHEN THEY ARE SICK. AND RECOVER WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB. AB THIRTY TWO SIXTEEN PROTECTS WORKERS THEIR FAMILIES THEIR WORKPLACES THEIR EMPLOYERS. EVEN THE CUSTOMERS FROM AN INCREASED RISK OF SPREAD OF COVERT NINETEEN. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO ADD AMENDMENTS TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE CONCERNS. AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU MISS RAY S. DOCTOR YOU ARE RECOGNIZED NO. MISTER IS THERE AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. BETTER TRACTION. IS THERE A AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS UP UNTIL LATE LAST NIGHT JUST ONE OF VERIFY IS THERE A THRESHOLD FOR THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPONENT OF THIS BILL. MISTER HOWARD LIKE CANCER. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS A SUMMER ARE COLLEAGUE IS REFERRING TO THE PAID SICK LEAVE AND KNOW ABOUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT SICK LEAVE RIGHT NOW DOES NOT HAVE AN EXEMPTION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S- APPROPRIATE FOR US TO START CREATING EXEMPTIONS FOR WHAT SHOULD BE A RIGHT FOR ALL WORKERS THAT'S WHY I'M MOVING ON THE SEVENTY THREE DAYS TO TRY TO FIND THE BALANCE OF THE IMPACT TO TOP IT ALL THE WORKERS OR ON THE BUSINESSES. OKAY MISTER VERY ON YOUR TIME. A THANK YOU I JUST WANTED CLARIFY THAT AND I AS MUCH AS I RESPECT THE WORK THAT MY COLLEAGUE IS DOING FROM SAN JOSE AND I VERY MUCH WOULD ONE APPRECIATE THIS BILL THAT PROVISION IS A STICKING POINT FOR ME I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN KEEP. HOW WE CAN COMPARE SMALL BUSINESSES OF FIVE OF THREE EMPLOYEES TO LARGER SIZED BUSINESSES WE NEED TO OPERATE THAT WE PROTECT SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING AND HEARING. MR HER THIRTY IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. ALSO WANTED TO ECHO THE CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL WANT TO SUPPORT OUR WORKERS ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC I THINK IT MAKES GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH SENSE TO- INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO STAY HOME. YOU KNOW DIRT DURING A PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW I BUT BUT MY CONCERN ARE THE MOM AND POP SMALL BUSINESSES I TALKED TO ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS LAST NIGHT THE GUARDINO BOWLING GARDENA NOW IF YOU'RE REALLY ANY GREAT WINE FOOD- IN THE THEY STOP BY THE GARDEN A BALL. BUT YOU KNOW I TALKED TO ONE OF THE OWNERS LAST NIGHT AND- AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. HOW YOU KNOW ME THERE THERE THERE'S A STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE DURING THIS PANDEMIC IT'S NOT JUST THE WORKERS THAT ARE STRUGGLING IT'S- IT'S THESE MOM AND POP SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE. REALLY STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE- TO GET THROUGH THIS AND THEY THEY CHOSE NOT TO CALL A SHUT DOWN I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR MAKING THE- THE- EXCEPTION FOR BIT OF BUSINESSES THAT CLOSE DOWN DURING A- PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO. STRUGGLE WITH THAT TAKE OUTS- AND THEY'RE BARELY MAKING IT. AND I IT WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THE AUTHOR LAST ENEMY HE HE KIND OF- CONFIDED WITH ME THAT HE HE'S ACTUALLY HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ACTUALLY A- A BERNIE GUY HE'S HE'S A BERNIE CRACK. AND HE WANTS TO DO NO HE HE RECOGNIZES THAT THAT- THAT WORKERS NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BUT THAT'S HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR A LOT OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES TO MAKE THINGS WORK DURING THIS ENDEMIC- SO. YOU KNOW I. IT IT'S A TOP OUT FOR ME BUT- YOU KNOW BAD BECAUSE THE AUTHORS MAYBE AMENDMENT TO GO FROM SEVEN DAYS TO THREE SIX DAYS- I'M I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT VULNERABLE WORKERS WE TALK ABOUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE VULNERABLE SMALL BUSINESS THE MOM AND POP SMALL BUSINESSES THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MOORE THIRTY SIR FOR YOUR RECORD STE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER OPPOSITION TO THIS IT IS INTERESTING FIRST AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT IF THIS IS A COVERT. BILL THEN WHY ISN'T THERE AN URGENCY CLAWS ON IT THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY SO IF WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO PROTECT PEOPLE THAT WERE LAID OFF DURING THE COLD CRISIS. SURE SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE BUT MY FEAR IS THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL IS THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE TRIED TO DO FOR AWHILE. IN MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID IT A COUPLE TIMES I WANT TO REITERATE THIS. MAIN STREET AMERICA HAS BEEN DECIMATED. THROUGH THIS COVERT CRISIS. AND IF THERE IS NOT AN EXEMPTION FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. WHETHER THE FLOWER SOP WHATEVER THAT MAY BE AND THERE'S ONLY ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES THERE. THOSE FOLKS CANNOT SURVIVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND LARGE BUSINESSES CERTAIN SIZE BUSINESS CAN ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THIS. BUT WHEN YOU START THINK ABOUT MAIN STREET AMERICA. WHEN THERE IS NO EXEMPTS. IS REALLY REALLY PER ALEX I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN OVER THANK YOU MISTER FLORA MISS GONZALES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU I RISE IN SUPPORT AND PROUD JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND I JUST WANT TO POINT SOMETHING OUT TO PEOPLE ON THE FLOOR I KNOW WE BUY INTO TALKING POINTS A LOT AND START GETTING WORRIED. THE TRUTH IS EVERY WORKER DESPITE WHERE THEY WORK DESERVES THE SAME PROTECTIONS. IN REALITY THE SMALL BUSINESSES WHETHER TO FLORES OR RESTAURANT. IF THEY'RE OPERATING THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO AMERI BILL THERE ARE YOU PROVIDING THIS MUCH SICK LEAVE DANCE EXCEPT IT'S SUCCEEDING AT THE SAME TIME. WHEN YOU OPERATE A SMALL BUSINESS ESPECIALLY RESTAURANT IN YOU HAVE A WORKER WHO SICK DURING A PANDEMIC WITH A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS DO YOU REALLY WANT THEM TO COME INTO YOUR SMALL BUSINESS. IN IN FACT EVERYBODY ELSE ARE WE GOING TO SAY THAT THEIR SPECIAL TIME. WHEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY CAN STAY HOME AND IT BECOMES. EASY WE'RE GOING TO WORK BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PREVENT THAT WORKER WHEN IN. BECAUSE IF IT'S BETWEEN PAYING THEIR BILLS ARE STAYING HOME SICK THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THEIR BILLS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. IT BUT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AS WE RE OPEN A PANDEMIC THAT THAT THRIVES ON. IT WILL BE IN A SMALL WORKPLACE TOGETHER AN ADDITIONAL THREE DAYS IS LIKE I SAID NO MORE THAN SMALL BUSINESSES ALREADY BEAR IN A MAJORITY OF THE BIG CITIES. IN CALIFORNIA AND YET DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY I THINK THEY CAN BEAR IN THE SMALL CITIES TO. AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT IN PARTICULAR IS THESE ESSENTIAL WORKERS PRIMARILY MIGRANT WORKERS WHO HAVE. BEEN FORCED. TO GO TO. SEC RED. IT WORKPLACE. THEY HAVE NO OTHER. I THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BILL. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE- ON THE- IS WHAT NEED IN ORDER TO. THAT THAT HOTELS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN PUBLIC SUBSIDIES TO IN AND HAVE SUPPORTED SUPPORT THEIR VERY WORKERS THAT WORKED THERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL. IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT RIGHT NOW IT STILL HAS TO GO THROUGH THE SENATE. I JUST ASK THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS WORKERS DURING THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER. WELL MISTER. NOW OKAY YOU. NEVER MIND MR BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I'M MATTER SPEAKER I JUST WANT TO RAISE MY VOICE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR I DO APPRECIATE THAT CONVERSATION- IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TRY TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN OUR OUR BUSINESS COMMITTEE OR SMALL BUSINESSES AND WORKERS BUT THIS IS THE TIME WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR OUR WORKERS WE NEED WE'VE CALLED OUR- OUR OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS ESSENTIAL. WE CALL THEM HEROES AND THEY ARE IN OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS NEED ESSENTIAL PROTECTIONS THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT GOING TO WORK RISKING THEIR OWN HEALTH RISK IN THE HEALTH OF THEIR LOVED ONES RISKY COMMUNITY HEALTH AND PUTTING FOOD ON THEIR TABLE THIS IS AN PROTECTION IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO THIS IS THE TIME TO STAND UP WE HAVE A AN AUTHOR. A LEAD AUTHOR WHO'S WILLING TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES GOING FORWARD SO YOU'RE RIGHT THE FLAG THEN LET'S MOVE THIS OFF THE FLOOR TODAY THE PROVIDER ESSENTIAL WORKERS WITH THE ESSENTIAL PROTECTIONS THAT THEY DESERVE THANK YOU THANK YOU MR BONTA MEMBERS IF YOU SEE RECOGNITION PLEASE GO TO THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER RAISE YOUR MAKES. MISTER KARGER YOU ARE RIGHT. I WANT TO THANK YOU. I. R. IN THE ROBUST. THAT WE HAD ON THE- ON THIS. AND AT THE THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HERE'S- A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK. TO IT. SMALL BUSINESS. CONTINUE TO BE THE BACKBONE OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. LOOKING VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT SOME PEOPLE HERE SAID WHAT'S GONNA BREAK. A SMALL BUSINESSES. SCHEDULING AROUND A PERSON WHO TAKES THREE DAYS OFF. IS NOT GOING TO BREAK A SMALL BUSINESS. IT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT. I DON'T SEE THAT IT AND IT'S BEEN ECHOED AND IT'S BEEN A GOOD BEFORE IF YOU'RE SO IF SOMEBODY IS SICK YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM AT WORK. THIS SIMPLE. MINOR BILL THE GIVES SOMEBODY ABILITY. TO STAY HOME FOR THREE DAYS. AND CERTAINLY IF IT IF THE BILL AT THE BILL CONTINUES SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUES COULD BE ADDRESSED. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO STOP A BILL. THAT IS GOING TO PROTECT FRONT LIGHT WORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THE VERY COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT NOW THERE'S BEEN TALK THAT TALK ABOUT RETENTION OF WORKERS BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS. IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME WORKERS IN SOME OF THE SECTORS AND YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BRING THAT EMPLOYEE BACK. YOU DON'T IF YOUR EMPLOYER WHO'S TRYING TO TRIED TRIED BUT- ORGANIZED IN THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THIS EMPLOYEE BACK YOU DON'T AND YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF RULES. IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE WHOSE MAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT EMPLOYEE BACK. YOU PROBABLY WON'T. THIS IS MEANT TO GIVE SOME SORT OF SOME SORT OF LEGAL STANDING TO EMPLOY TO WORKERS. WHO HAD TO LEAVE FOR NO OTHER REASON THAT WAS A PANDEMIC THIS YEAR THESE ARE WORKERS WHO WENT HOME BECAUSE THEY FELT LIKE IT ONE DAY. THESE ARE WORKERS WHO'S JUST DECIDED TO SKIP WORK PROTEST THE FACT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK GO HOME AND NOT PAY THEIR BILLS. AND LET'S BE REAL ABOUT THIS. WORK WE HAD TO STAY HOME. BECAUSE IT WAS A PAN MAKE. AND THEY GET SICK. BUT I BET YOU THAT'S BEEN ECHOED BEFORE BECAUSE I READ ONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES OR YOU HAD HOSPITALITY WORKERS WOULD YOU HAD THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRIES WE HAD LARGE SECTORS IN LARGE POPULATIONS WHO COULDN'T GO TO WORK IF YOU ASK ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE. THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE I RENT TO PAY. LITTLE KIDS TO FEED AND IT WAS INCREDIBLY IN PARK THEY WERE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY BEFORE. FROM NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THE RENT. WELL THAT NOW IT'S ABOUT FOUR FIVE PAYCHECKS BEHIND WHERE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PAY THE RENT LET ME VERY CLEAR. TO THOSE THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO PUNISH. SOMEBODY WHO FOR NO REASON OUTSIDE OF A PANDEMIC COULD NOT COME BACK TO WORK. LET'S BE VERY CLEAR IF YOUR BOTTOM LINE INDUSTRY. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE AN EMPLOYEE BACK WAS MAKING TWENTY BUCKS OVER MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE. ALL THIS BILL BASICALLY SIMPLY SAYS. THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD THE SENATE IS GIVE THAT EMPLOY THE ABILITY TO COME BACK TO WORK WITH THE WAR. IF THE EMPLOYEE WITH BUDGET. THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION LET'S HAVE IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE HERE THAT'S NOT WITH HIS BILLS TRYING TO DO. AND THERE IS THE AUTHOR CAN CLEAR UP I BELIEVE IT'S THREE DAYS NOW. THAT'S A VERY MODEST SCHEDULING. ISSUE THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BREAK ANY SMALL. I WITHOUT IRES CAN HIRE TONIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER SANTA TRIED AGAIN SEEING HEARING NO FURTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MISTER KALRA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANKS THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE- ON THIS MATTER. ARE YOU KNOW. IN MY- IN MY DISTRICT I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN IN THE BAY AREA. THREE OF THE MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED ZIP CODES ARE IN MY DISTRICT IN THE SAN JOSE. WHY ARE THEY IN THE DISTRICT. BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE WORKING CLASS PEOPLE OF SILICON VALLEY. THE LATINO VIETNAMESE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING HARD EVERYDAY WASHING DISHES. CLEANING BATHROOMS. BEING FORCED TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE CALLED ESSENTIAL YEAH THEY'RE BEING TREATED AS IF THEIR SACRIFICIAL. NOW I'M DOING MY BEST TO TRY TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AND YES I MEAN I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY CLAUSE ON THIS. I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BELIEVE THAT TWO THIRDS THE FOLKS BEFORE WOULD VOTE FOR IT BUT URGENCY CLAUSE BUT- I'M DOING I'M WORK WITH WHAT I HAVE HERE. AND THE REALITY IS THAT. POVICH WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO BE WITH US BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HELP US. FRAME THE EXPECTATION FOR ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES WOULD WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS. AGAIN AND AGAIN AND EVERY EMPLOYER. EVERY COUNTY. EVERY WORKER.

AND THE BOSS SAYS ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY I HAVE TO SEND YOU HME FOR TWO WEEKS. ARE WE GONNA PUT ALL THE WORKER. TO HAVE TO SACRIFICE TO MAKE IT TO THOSE TWO WEEKS WERE COMMUTERS OUT A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF TO HELP GET THEM THROUGH THIS CRISIS. AS I STATED WE WILL BE MAKING A MANAGED TO REDUCE THE DAYS OF SEVEN TO THREE DAYS WE WILL EXAMPLES THIS IS THERE A CLOSE DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO TALK WITH OPPOSITION ON THE RIGHT A RECALL INVITED RETENTION. THIS OF THE PEOPLE WORKING ON THIS BILL ALL THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY BE MADE TONS OF AMENDMENTS AND ASSEMBLY APPROACH I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT THAT'S HOW I OPERATE. UNDER ASKING YOU TO THINK OF THESE WERE. THERE IN EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS. IF THEY'RE NOT ALREADY UNEMPLOYED THEY'RE BEING FORCED TO GO TO WORK IF THEY CAN'T JUST NOT SHOW UP OR THEY'LL GET FIRED I WOULD THEN THEY'RE TOLD THEY HAVE TO GO HOME. LET'S THINK ABOUT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES I THINK ABOUT THE LITTLE THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THEM IN THESE VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. WE CAN FIND THAT BALANCE AND I'M I'M- THIS BILL FINDS THAT BALANCE. AND I'M COMMITTED. TO BRING BACK A BILL ON CONCURRENT THAT YOU'LL- YOU'LL BE HAPPY WITH. A YOU'LL BE CONFIDENT.

SOME PEOPLE TWENTY NINETY THREE BY SOME THE RIVER HOLDER ACCOLADE HEALING ARTS. MR HOLDING YOU ARE A- THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER OF I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE EIGHTY THREE. THE BILL ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SAFETY AND HEALTH CARE. AUTOMATIC PHARMACY SYSTEMS CAN BE HELP FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS WHO TAKE DAILY MEDICATIONS BY REDUCING LAG TIME BETWEEN REFILLS. HOWEVER SOME LARGE PHARMACIES HAVE TAKEN THIS PROCESS A STEP TOO FAR BY REQUESTING REFILLS BEYOND WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PRESCRIBED. THE PRACTICE ALSO INCLUDES BOMBARDING DOCTORS WITH FACTS. A RESPONSE. FAR BEYOND WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DONE OVER. GAINES REFILL OVER. ARE WE THE BOMBARDMENT OF REQUESTS CAN EASILY LEAD TO MISTAKES WHEN APPROVING THE DISPENSING MEDICATION TO PATIENTS AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY THREE WOULD ENSURE PATIENTS OPT END TO AN AUTO REFILL PROGRAM IF THEY WANT TO USE IT AND DOCTORS HAVE MORE CONTROL TO ENSURE THE NUMBER OF REFILLS A PATIENT RECEIVES AS RECOMMENDED BY THE DOCTOR. NOT THE PHARMACY. AN EXAMPLE INCLUDES A PHARMACY ASKING. TO REFILL A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D. SUPPLEMENTS STATING THAT THE PATIENT REQUEST OF THE REFILL. THE DOCTOR WAS SURPRISED CALL THE PATIENT TO CONFIRM THE PATIENTS CITY ABSOLUTELY HAD NOT ASKED FOR A REFILL. THIS MEDICATION CAN LEAD TO TALK CITY AND KIDNEY STONES. THE PHARMACY HAD LIED AND USE THE AUTO REFILL EXCUSE TO FAX AND CALL. THEIR BEEN REFILL REQUESTS ON DECEASED PATIENTS. A PATIENT WHO CHANGE THEIR PHARMACY BUT THE DOCTOR KEPT GETTING THE FAXES AFTER THE FAXES REQUESTING. A REFILL FROM THE OLD PHARMACY. FIFTEEN REFILLS ON A THREE MONTH SUPPLY OF MEDICATION ALMOST FOUR YEARS WORTH OF MEDICATION. IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THOSE PATIENTS WHEN THOSE REQUESTS ART LOOKED AT CLOSELY THINGS FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS IN MEMBER. AND A MEMBER OF THE DOCTOR STAFF APPROVE IT. MEDICAL WASTE AT BEST IMPATIENT DANGER AT WORST. THE MEMBERS CLARIFY THE WORD AUTOMATICALLY TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIRTY DAY RESTRICTION DOES NOT APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO OPT IN TO AUTO REFILL PROGRAM. THE STRIKE THE REQUIREMENT THAT EACH PRESCRIPTION NEEDS A SEPARATE WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION SO PATIENTS CAN CONTINUE TO USE THE AUTOMATIC REFILL PROGRAM AS THEY ARE NOW. AND THEY DELAY OPERATIVE DATE UNTIL TWENTY pHAVE ENOUGH TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW OUTSIDE OF THE PANDEMIC. I AM WILLING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MEMBERS AND THE OPPOSITION AND LET ME JUST SAY I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE MEMBERS TO RAISE THEIR CONCERNS AROUND THIS BILL THE AMENDMENTS ADDRESS WERE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE IN THE SENATE TO WORK. OUR WITH THE OPPOSITION ON ANY LINGERING CONCERNS. INCLUDING INTENT LANGUAGE THAT CLARIFIES THIS BILL DOES NOT HINDER PATIENTS FROM USING AUTO REFILL PROGRAMS REQUIRE PATIENTS TO GIVE AUTHORIZATION MORE THAN ONCE OR DEAD DICTATE HOW AUTHORIZATION HAPPENS. I BELIEVE THIS BILL BOTH PRESERVES PATIENT SAFETY AND ALLOWSTHE CONVENIENCE OF AUTOMATIC REFILLS. THIS PUTS THE POWER IN THE DOCTOR'S HANDS AND DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE WAY PATIENTS AND PHARMACISTS IN IRAQ TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL. THANK YOU MISTER HOLDEN SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER THE CLERK WILL OPEN. ALL MEMBERS. OF THE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED TO THEIR TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS GO TO THEIR TO VOTE. THE WHERE.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR THE CRISIS ACT WILL ESTABLISH A PILOT PROGRAM TO SCALE UP COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS FIRST RESPONDERS. INTERACTIONS WITH POLICE CAN BE SCARY FOR MANY PEOPLE. WELL IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATIONS WITH IMMIGRANT STATUS CONCERNS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE MEMBERS OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY PEOPLE WHO ARE BLACK AND OTHER FOLKS HISTORICALLY TRAUMATIZED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ALL WANT RESOLUTIONS AND SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS. CAUSING THEM DISTRESS. BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SHAMED OR JUDGED FOR THEIR PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCE THEY DON'T WANT TO REST SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT CHARGES THEY DON'T WANT A FATALITY. THEY WANTED DE ESCALATED RESOLUTION AND THEY WANT FAMILY AND COMMUNITY PIECE THEY WANT PUBLIC SAFETY BUT NOT AT THE COST OF A LIFE. FOR MOST OF US NINE ONE ONE IS THE ONLY OPTION FOR ANY CRISIS AND YET FOR MANY WE DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE WITH WHOEVER IS ON THE OTHER LINE BECAUSE THE RESPONSE IS OFTENTIMES NOT SCALABLE. SO MANY COMMUNITIES AND UP LESS SAFE AS A RESULT. AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR IS ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT HEALTH BILL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS OVER TROUT I'M TRAUMATIZED UNDER TRAINED IN CERTAIN INSTANCES AND SOMETIMES ON SYMPATHETIC TO CERTAIN CALLS. CURRENTLY WE ASK OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO SHIFT THE ADRENALINE THE TACTIC AND THE FORCE THAT THEY USE TO APPREHEND AN ARMED ROBBER FOR EXAMPLE TO THE SCHIZOPHRENIC YOUNG MALE. THAT IS UNREALISTIC AND IT'S ON Y. AND CAN BE FATAL WHEN THOSE TWO PEOPLE APPEAR TO BE THE SAME PERSON IN THE EYES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. THàNH HALL MOTHER OF MILES HALL A TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD WALNUT CREEK RESIDENT. WHO WAS KILLED A YEAR AGO DURING A SCHIZO AFFECTIVE DISORDER INDUCED CRISIS SAYS THAT IF THIS BILL HAD EXISTED A YEAR AGO HER SON WOULD BE ALIVE. OF COURSE THIS IS ALSO A COMMUNITY HEALTH BILL IN CITIES ACROSS THE STATE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE RESPONDING SUCCESSFULLY TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS INVOLVING ON HOUSE PEOPLE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FOLKS EXPOSED TO VIOLENCE FOLKS EXPERIENCING SUBSTANCE OF THIS AND PEOPLE IMPACTED BY NATURAL OR CLIMATE DISASTERS. YET DESPITE THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT IN COST SAVINGS OF THESE COMMUNITY ORIENTED RESPONSES TO EMERGENCIES OUR STATE HAS DONE LITTLE TO SUPPORT AND SCALE UP THESE EFFORTS. INSTEAD WE'RE ASKING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES BETTER SUITED TO PEER SUPPORT EXPERTS MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS OR CRISIS COUNSELORS TRAINED TO DE ESCALATE AND RESOLVE CRISES. AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR WOULD MARSHALL IN AN ARRAY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO QUIP TO STEP IN AS FIRST RESPONDERS THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CREDIBILITY WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND VALUE THE LIFE AND CIRCUMSTANCE. OF PEOPLE WHO REQUIRE HELP. X. ENDING ROLLING CAN BE PARTNERS DE NOT MEAN A LIMóN LINE FOR. IT MEANS YOU ARE EMPOWERING GROUPS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITIES WHILE OFFERING THE POLICE TO FOCUS ON ISSUES MORE SUITED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING. AB TWENTY FIFTY FOUR RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN COMMITTEE WITH ZERO NO VOTES THE BILL IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS FROM A VARIETY OF SECTORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THE ROLE FOR CO AUTHORS.
