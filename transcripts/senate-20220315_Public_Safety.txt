OF TO LONG MANAGED. THE RAINING BAND- BEEN OPTION AND THEN LANGUAGE IN THIS- ONLY TRAINING MENTION OF- THAT BILL RECCA HAS HAD CONGRESO WITH ON AND SPONSOR- ABOUT THE HI AND THEY HAVE SAID THAT THEY WOULD- MAKE SURE- THAT ALTERNATIVES ARE ALSO INCLUDED AND THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE- ULTIMATELY- THEY WANT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE BEST OPTION NOT ONLY TRAINING BUT ANY OTHER POTENTIAL OPTIONS AS WELL- AND THEN I CAN'T.

THANK YOU IN OBJECTION. ED IN UPPER AS REMOTE PLEASE ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. EIGHT EIGHT TWO. M. MR CHERNOBYL ELSE'S QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. GREAT NOW WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS RELATES TO AS THREE EIGHT EIGHT TWO. SENATOR TOM WATER. OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO THINK- SENATOR EGGMAN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD SHE AND I HAD TALKED ABOUT IT YESTERDAY- AND I. WOULD- ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE- ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK. ELEVATING THE ISSUES OF THE ACT I D. D. COMMUNITY- IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMON SHARED BY THE ADVOCATE FROM DRC- YOU KNOW AND-MY HOPE IS THAT AS THIS BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS. THAT THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL IS NOT TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON TRAINING AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. IN L. A. COUNTY WHERE A YOUNG MAN. WITH SCOLIOSIS WHO IS AUTISTIC- AND DEAF PARTIALLY- WAS ESSENTIALLY SHOT BY A DEPUTY FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD ALREADY GONE THROUGH A SERIES OF TRAINING PROGRAMS AND IN FACT DURING THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS REVEALED THAT I THINK WITHIN A YEAR OF THAT HAPPENING ARE PRIOR TO THAT HAPPENING. EVEN THE DEPUTIES INVOLVED HAD GONE THROUGH THE TRAINING PROCESS AND HAD BEEN WORKING WITH DISABILITY GROUPS AND SO IT SHOWS THAT THE ISSUE ISN'T THE REMEDY IS AND ALSO ALWAYS TRAINING. BUT IT IS HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT SEE THE IDT COMMUNITIES MAYBE HOW THEY ARE WORKING MORE AGGRESSIVELY WITH ADVOCATES FROM THAT PARTICULAR SPACE- TO HELP THEM IDENTIFY- BEHAVIORS OR TRAITS OR TRIGGERS EXCEPT AROUND BECAUSE ULTIMATELY AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH A POPULATION THAT MAY HAVE UNREGULATED- BODIES AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T. SUGGEST THAT AS A RESULT BAD THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM SO MY HOPE IS THAT SOMEHOW DURING THE COURSE OF THIS- PROCESS THAT SOME OF THAT CAN BE INCLUDED AND THEN- MAYBE ALSO. THE TO CONSIDER FOR THAT COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP YOU KNOW IF ADVOCATES COULD ALSO INCLUDE THOSE WHO HAVE REPRESENTED VICTIMS OR SURVIVORS. OF PARTICULAR INCIDENTS THAT COME FROM THE IDT COMMUNITY BECAUSE I THINK THOSE FOLKS ACTUALLY HAVE A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FROM BOTH SIDES AND CAN MAYBE HELP IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO- REVEAL FROM THE COUNCIL SO THAT WE CAN SEE BETTER OUTCOMES. BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE IN A POPULATION THAT'S REALLY DEAR TO ME. THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT SURE CHOI BOOK. GOOD MORNING. FIRST OF ALL THANK YEAR WINDOW TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERT AT THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE BUT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'M ALWAYS AN ADVOCATE FOR. MORE BRITISH NO TRAINING WHEN IT COMES TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HEARD. FROM MY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- COMMUNITIES IS THAT WE SHOULD INVEST IN- ADDITIONAL TRAINING WE CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH TRAINING IN A WEEK WE CAN SEE THAT IN MANY MANY FIELDS IN EDUCATION- IN THE MEDICAL FIELD THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALWAYS LEARN AND PREPARE FOR SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING THIS FOR THAN I. ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL THAT POSSIBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY. CENTER SKINNER. AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVED CENTER SKINNER THANK YOU I'M CHAIR. THANK YOU- CENTERING IN FOR BRING THIS FORWARD I LIKE THE THERE'S A BIG TO IMPROVE TRAINING BUT I THINK S. B. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA POINTED OUT WE ALSO KNOW IN MY COLLEAGUES ARE FROM LOS ANGELES POINTED OUT THAT TRAINING WE KNOW THAT TRAINING ALONE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT SO I LIKE THE TICKET IN THE BILL OF PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING OUTCOMES. AND WHAT. WHAT I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST AND COURSE NOT TO DO IT HERE BUT AND I READ THE ANALYSIS THAT I DID NOT READ THE ENTIRE BILL TAXI MAY ALREADY SPECIFIED BUT THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO. ENHANCE THE PARTS AROUND IMPROVING OUTCOMES SO THAT IT DOESN'T ONLY REFERENCE TRAINING BUT BLIGHTED DITION ONLY WHAT- YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE FOR US RIGHT. NOW WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE STATE'S PILOTING TRYING DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHERE WE WOULD SEND SOMETHING OTHER THAN LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT THAT'S NOT STATEWIDE YET. AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THE STAFFING CAPABILITIES TO DO THAT STATEWIDE YET SO UNTIL WE HAVE THAT COMPLETELY RESOLVED THEN THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP. BUT I WOULD I DO VERY MUCH WITH WE HAVE A COUNCIL LIKE THIS AND THEY'RE REVIEWING DATA. THAT TO HAVE THAT YOU KNOW STRENGTHENED OUR ABILITY FOR THEM TO BRING US RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE THEY'LL BE LOOK AT THEIR RIGHT INTERACTING WITH POST LOOKING AT DATA REALLY HELPING US BECAUSE AS CITED. IN THE NOW SINCE WE KNOW. THAT THE END YOURS AUTHOR STATEMENT ALSO THAT WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISABILITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO UNFORTUNATELY- EXPERIENCE- IF VIOLENCE OR EVEN DEATH. WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT WE ALSO THIS OCCURS. IN OUR JAILS IN OUR CUSTODIAL SETTINGS WHEN WE LOOK AT WHO DIES IN JAIL CUSTODY OR EVEN IN PRISON CUSTODY OFTEN. IT'S A VERY- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT. UNCOMMON FOR THAT PERSON TO HAVE. THE THESE KIND OF DISABILITIES THAT ARE EITHER INTERPRETED BY. YOU KNOW THERE CONSTRUED OFFICER IS BEING JUST LIKE- DEFIANT BEHAVIOR SOMETHING VERSUS THE ACTUAL WEATHER IF THE PERSON'S ARTISTIC OR WHO KNOWS ON WHAT WHAT THEY'RE DIFFERENT DISABILITY IS THAT IT IS JUST THEIR BEHAVIOR THERE IS NOT ANYTHING THEY CAN CONTROL ABOUT THAT. AND SO- WE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE IN THAT SITUATION DATE IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THAT PARTICULAR KIND OF DISABILITY I'M SORRY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THE E. IN ORDER TO JUST VOTE CHANGE HER BEHAVIOR ENACT LIKE SOMEONE ELSE EXPECTS YOU TO ACT. SO I'M GLAD THAT IT- THAT THE BILL HAS MORE THAN JUST THE TRAINING AND I HOPE THAT THAT ASPECT OF IT CAN BE ENHANCED AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU ANY OTHER IS TO COME TO QUESTIONS OF CENTER TO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND- APPRECIATE. THE THOUGHTFULNESS HERE BECAUSE IT'S- LEGISLATION WHICH TRULY NEEDED OUR DISABILITY COMMUNITY NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE RESPECTED BUT PROTECTED AS WELL SO ON THAT NOTE- IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS YEAH AND I THINK THIS IS A POPULATION THAT WE ALL KNOW NEEDS OFTEN HAS MORE THAN ONE ISSUE GOING ON AND YOU HEARD FROM A PARENT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE POPULATION ALSO THE PARENTS WHO THE LAST THING THEY WANT TO HAVE TO DO IS CALL NINE ONE ONE- WHEN THEY WHEN THEY KNOW THEIR CHILD IS IT EVEN MORE AT RISK JUST DUE TO HOW THEY HOW THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES OFTENTIMES AND THEIR INABILITY TO FOLLOW- A DIRECTION THAT SOMEONE MIGHT MEDAVOY'S EXPECTS ME TO FOLLOW SO- THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS BUT YES THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT TRAINING IT'S ABOUT GATHERING THE DATA. WITH REPRESENTATION BILL ACTUALLY LOOK AT IT AND I THINK THAT CENTER SCANNERS AND ABOUT TRAINING BUT LOOKING AT AT THE TRAINING IS LOOKING AT THE OUTCOMES THE INTERVENTIONS AND ALSO I THINK THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THOSE. RIGHT SOMETHING BAD. LOOK WHAT WERE DO THEY WHAT ELSE TODAY TO OFFER DID THEY- A MENTAL HEALTH. PERSON O OUT WITH THEM OR DID THEY HAVE TO SET UP. TO WITHIN ALSO I THINK BE INSTRUCTIVE TO WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO DEVELOP ON THE GROUND. SO THAT EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO OUT OR THEY'RE GOING OUT. IN SOME KIND OF OTHER COMMUNITY SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- SUPPORT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND A PEACE OF MIND FOR- FOR BOTH PEOPLE SUFFERING. FROM IDENTITY ISSUES AND ALSO- THEIR FAMILIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

SENATE BILL NINE SIXTEEN AIMS TO EMPOWER SURVIVORS OFSEXUAL ASSAULT ACROSS CALIFORNIA SB NINE SIXTEEN UPDATES CURRENT LAW TO REQUIRE THAT THE INFORMATION GIVEN TO A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT INCLUDES A STATEMENT THAT THEY CANNOT BE FOUND IN CONTEMPT FOR NOT TESTIFYING AS WELL AS TO MAKE IT A RIGHT FOR A SURVIVOR TO REQUEST SPECIFIC pREGARDING ANY DNA SAMPLES THAT WERE TAKEN THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WILL HELP EMPOWER SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS ACROSS OUR STATE AND HELP THEM CONTINUE IN THEIR HEALING PROCESS WITH ME TODAY VIRTUALLY IS DA O'MALLEY- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU- WE HAVE NANCY O'MALLEY'S D. A. ALAMEDA COUNTY AS YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT. D. A. MALING WHEN YOU'RE READY- YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY OF FOUR MINUTES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS NANCY O'MALLEY'S HE SAID IN IN ADDITION IN ADDITION TO BEING THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY I'VE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS I BEGAN AS A RAPE CRISIS VOLUNTEER. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND I HAVE SEEN THE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS YOUR LEGISLATURE HAS MADE AND PROTECTING AND ENSURING THE RIGHTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- LEGISLATURES BEEN ENACTING LAWS THAT SPECIFICALLY ENHANCE THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. IF THEY CAN'T TO THE ENACTMENT OF THESE LAWS HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY GIVING POWER BACK TO THE VICTIM SURVIVOR. WHEN SOMEONE IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME ALL POWER CHOICE AND DECISION OR TAKING AWAY TAKEN AWAY. GIVING BACK POWER COMES IN THE FORM OF DECISION MAKING I BEING KEPT INFORMED OF ANY PROGRESS OR ACTION TAKEN IN THE CASE. ENSURING RESPECT AND CARE FROM THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT HER OR HIM. AND THIS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE AREA OF TESTING SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EVIDENCE KIT. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF NOW SENATOR AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SKINNER. AND MORE RECENTLY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR LEYVA. THE LAW NOW REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SAID THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT KITS FOR TESTING. WITHIN STRICT TIME FRAMES. DRIVING THOSE TWO LAWS WAS THE FACT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS SIMPLY NOT SENDING FORENSIC EVIDENCE KITS TO CRIME LAB FOR TESTING. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE VICTIM SURVIVOR HAD CONSENTED TO HAVE THE KIDS. DONE AND AT FULL SPEED PATIENTS THAT SOMETHING WOULD BE DONE WITH THAT CAT. VICTIM SURVIVORS NEVER EVEN KNEW THOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS REQUIRED- WHAT'S REQUIRED BY LAW TO NOTIFY VICTIMS SURVIVOR. THAT THE KID WAS NOT BEING TESTED THAT'S DID NOT HAVE FOR FIVE TOO MANY. EVERYTHING TO YOUR IN RESPONSE RELIGIOUS PASS LAWS THE HOLD MOM ACCOUNT. BY DIRECTING THAT OF JUSTICE TO CREATE SAFE HE SEPARATE DATABASE THAT REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENTER DATA REGARDING THE PROGRESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL KIDS. THIS BILL SB NINE SIXTEEN REITERATES THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM SURVIVOR CAN ACCESS HIS OR HER OWN FILING SAFETY. SHE HE CAN ENSURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TAKING ALL LEGAL STEPS I HAD TO GET TESTED. TASTY DATABASE DOES NOT CONTAIN MEDICAL INFORMATION IT CONTAINS DOCUMENTATION THAT THE KID WAS BOOKED INTO AN EVIDENCE ROOM AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT IT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED FOR TESTING WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES AND THAT BUT AND THE PROGRESS FOLLOWING SUBMISSION. IN ADDITION FOR MORE THAN FORTY YEARS CALIFORNIA LAW HAS STATED THAT A VICTIM SURVIVORS SEXUAL ASSAULT CANNOT BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF THE COURT INCLUDING IMPRISONMENT OR CONFINEMENT. FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIME IT AGAINST HER OR HIM. THIS BILL REQUIRES TO ADD A STATEMENT OF THAT LOBBY INCLUDED IN THE CARD PROVIDED TO THE VICTIM SURVIVOR THAT OUTLINES THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS SHE OR HE HAS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. HOW TO SAY THAT MY OFFICE HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF ADDRESSING THE BACKLOG OF UNTESTED KITS. IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND IN EXPANDING PROTECTIONS AND RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

AND NOBODY IS QUEUING UP MISTER CHAIR. OKAY NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION WE HAVE NO LEAD OPPOSITION LISTEN ON THIS MEASURE IS OR ANYONE HERE IN A ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF US THREE NINE ONE SIX. HEARING TÍNH NONE MODERATOR NOW WILL GO TO THE PHONE MUCH. THANK YOU TO OUR EXPRESS OPPOSITION FOR SB NINE ONE SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. NO PARTICIPANTS ARE QUEUING UP. OKAY CENTER LIVE HE DONE A GREAT JOB OF SCARING OFF ALL OPPOSITION- DO WE CAN- WILL NOW MOVE BACK TO COMMISSIONERS CANNOT. THANK YOU DEAR THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA FOR BRING THE BILL- WELL IT'S CLEAR IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VEALREADY GIVEN THE PERSON WHO IS REPORTED TO SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW ASK FOR THIS INFORMATION IT'S NOT A HEROES HAS SO MANY THINGS WE DO THE PERSON THE SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW AND DOESN'T ALWAYS KNOW WHO TO CONTACT IN SO THIS IS A NEEDED NOW. THE QUESTION I HAVE. AND IT HAD- THIS BILL IS NARROW IN THAT IT JUST BECAUSE PROVIDES THIS CARD BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR THE AUTHOR IN PERHAPS FOR YOUR LEAD WITNESS IT IS. WHETHER IN IN MAYBE HAS TO BE DONE IN ANOTHER BILL BUT WHETHER WE NEED. TO ADD A FURTHER PROTECTION TO OUR SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS. BECAUSE IT IS COME OUT NOW THAT WE HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE- PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE NOT PROSECUTOR WAS PUT AT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. THAT TOOK THE DNA OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN OTHER WORDS TOOK TOOK THE EVIDENCE FROM THE RAPE KIT. AND PLACES WHERE I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT BECAUSE I HATE THAT TERM BUT WHATEVER TOOK THAT EVIDENCE. ARENDT PUT IT THROUGH THE SAME DATABASE TO SEE WHETHER THAT PERSON HAD. IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRIME AND OF COURSE RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT. THE REPORTING RATES FOR SEXUAL IF YOU WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. THE VERY IDEA THE VERY ACT OF GOING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALREADY SUCH A LOW PERCENT. THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT THAT MINIMIZES OR LESSONS OR HAS THE CHILLING EFFECT ON PEOPLE TO REPORT THEIR ASSAULT. AND SO NOW WE WITH THIS WE'RE TRYING TO ASSIST THOSE SURVIVORS. BUT DO WE NEED ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THERE THE EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE SUBMITTED WILL THEN NOT BE USED AGAINST THEM. SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF EITHER THE AUTHOR OR THE- EARLY PROPONENT WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU CENTERS CAN I AM WELL AWARE OF THE CASE IN WHICH YOU'RE TALKING BUT I DO THINK THAT DETAIL MALLEY WOULD BE BETTER FIRST AND PROBABLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION BETTER. DO MALLEY ARE YOU STILL THERE. I AM YES THANK YOU THANK YOU. D. SAID THE OCCURRENCE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH THEIR CRIME LAB IS. OUTRAGEOUS AND I BELIEVE IT'S AN ANOMALY TO HOW. THE CRIME LABS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE. BEEN PROCESSING. IT IT'S VERY CLEAR AND I'VE CONFIRM THIS WITH SEVERAL OF THEM AND A MAJORITY OF THE- DNA. ANALYSIS IS BEING DONE BY OUR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THERE THE CRIME LAB FOR FORTY EIGHT OF THE COUNTIES- INTO THEIR VERY FEW CAPS THAT ARE. I THINK IN THEIR OWN COUNTY IN MY COUNTY SO THE- B. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE- IT'S AN ANOMALY THAT HAPPENED AND OTHER CRIME LABS ARE NOT KEEPING THE SEPARATE DATABASES THAT CONTAIN THE VICTIM SURVIVORS DNA OR ANY OTHER. BIOLOGICAL REFERENCE OF THE VICTIM. AND SO I YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK THAT IT'S EVEN TAKE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY HAVE DECLARED THAT THEY ARE CORRECTING WHATEVER THE- SITUATIONS THAT THEY CREATED- AND- IF THERE IS SOME DISCUSSION POINT ABOUT TRYING TO COME UP WITH FASHION SOME LANGUAGE I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE INVOLVED WITH THAT. WELL IN PERHAPS IT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVE WE WOULD HAVE TO DO SEPARATELY BUT WHILE IT MAY BE UNIQUE AND AN ANOMALY IT HAPPENED. IT WAS HIGH PROFILED AND SO IT. IT I CAN'T HELP BUT KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE A FURTHER CHILLING EFFECT. ON PEOPLE WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED FROM REPORTING. THEIR ASSAULT I AM VERY UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW. THAT- SEVEN FOLDABLE PEOPLE BACK WHETHER THEY'RE ON HOW STE. WHETHER ANY NINE HAVE ADDICTS UNITS ARE MORE. LIKELY TO WIN MAYBE NOT MORE LIKELY BUT THEY ARE PRONE TO BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY ARE. MORE VULNERABLE THEY HAVE LESS- JUST LESS SAFEGUARDS AND PROTECTIONS WHETHER BECAUSE THEY LIVE ON THE STREET OR BECAUSE THEY ARE IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES. AND YET THERE ARE SALTY'S JUSTICE CRIMINALS ANYBODY. ELSE'S AND WE NEED EVERYBODY TO REPORT. SO IN WE MAY NEED FIX THAT WHILE ICE THIS BILL AS IMPORTANT TO HELP SUPPORT. OUR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND TO GIVE THEM YOU KNOW FURTHER INTO AN- MMHM AGENCY TO ACT ON THEIR BEHALF I ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT. IN OTHER WAYS CREATING A CHILLING EFFECT SO- BUT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SURE WINNER. THANK YOU AND JUST TO ALERT EVERYONE THAT WILL BE HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE WE- THAT'LL EXISTS- IT'S S. B. TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH I INTRODUCED A FEW WEEKS AGO TO BAN ON THE PRACTICE OF MISUSING- RAPE KIT ANOTHER VICTIM DNA TO THE AND PROSECUTE. THAT PICKED UP THE VICTIM IN THE FUTURE IS TO MISS USE THAT DENIES WERE CATEGORICALLY BANNING THAT PRACTICE- WHAT HAPPENED WITH US OF PITTI WAS JUST JUST SHOCKING- MIND BLOWING THAT THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND I KNOW EVEN THOUGH CHIEF SCOTT AND SAN FRANCISCO HAS INDICATED THAT HE DOES NOT CONDONE THAT AND TO GET A CHANGE OF POLICIES AND EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A LOCAL AND NOW INTRODUCED OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SAN FRANCISCO TO BAN THE PRACTICE- BUT WE NEED TO SHUT IT DOWN STATEWIDE TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THANKS IN THE VERY VERY CLEAR AND POWERFUL POWERFUL MESSAGE TO VICTIMS THAT WE KNOW IT IS SO DRAMATIC TO COME FORWARD TO REPORT TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND THAT'S WHY SO FEW PEOPLE DO IT AND IT IS EVEN MORE- DRAMATIC TO GO TO THE- IT MEET. AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THREE TIMES BEEN SO BADLY TRAUMATIZED. AND NOW YOU HAVE TO YOU CAN'T WAIT A WEEK. YOU GOT TO GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE HOSPITAL TO HAVE AN INVASIVE. EXAM DONE IT'S TOUGH FOR A RATE CUT. AND THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS SEND A MESSAGE WELL THAT MAYBE IS GOING TO BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THE FUTURE WE NEED SOME A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT WILL NOT BE USED AGAINST YOU IN THAT WE SUPPORT YOU. SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE INTRODUCED US BE TALL TWENTY. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSS S.

MENTAL HEALTH OR DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE AND THEN THAT THOSE OFFICERS FOR EXAMPLE ONCE AGAIN- OF STAIRS SIX OFFICERS WITH THAT ADDITIONALLY TRYING TO WORK FIVE EIGHT HOUR SHIFTS WITH SOCIAL SERVICES BACK BIRDS ON HOMELESSNESS AND THEY WILL BE CALLED OUT. THERE ARE THESE TYPES OF CALLS AND THAT TEAM WILL RESPOND THE OFFICER GOES IN SEARCH- JERRY MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY AND THEN BACKED OUT OF THE SITUATION AND LET'S BE BACK SPORTS AND THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE ARE GOING IN AND THEN TRY TO GET HELP FROM THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE RESPONDING TO THE WORK BUT IT'S A FUNDING ISSUE THE PROGRAMS WE'VE SEEN ALL. ARE SHOULD BE FOR OUR LOCAL INITIATIVE TRYING TO PIECE TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE ANAHEIM HAS A VERY GOOD PROGRAM- THEY'VE WORKED WITH THE COUNTY BOARD WHO GAVE THEM TO YOU KNOW HEALTH EXPERTS ON THEIR PROGRAM- AND THEY RESPOND NOT ONLY TO HOMELESSNESS BUT ALSO THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND LIKE I SAID A DRUG OR ALCOHOL ABUSE ISSUES WHEN THEY TRY TO GET ON THE SERVICES THEY WORK. PROGRAM YOU'RE WORKING MANY CITIES ARE TRYING IT NOW BUT THE FUNDING IS THE ISSUE SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IN THE FUTURE THIS WILL BE THE FUTURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHERE OFFICERS WILL GO INTO SECURING THE AREA BUT AND THEN STEP BACK AND LET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS HOW DOES.

I APOLOGIZE MODERATOR AB MARINE TRANSITION HERE SO GIVE ME ONE SECOND WE ARE CURRENTLY GOING TO HEAD OFF WITH THEIR LEAD OPPOSITION IN PERSON HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE. WE HAVE DONE A CAT. SORRY RIGHT OUR MAIL I'M FROM THE STATE POLICY AT THERE IS THIS STATE POLICY DIRECTOR AT SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC AND SEPARATE AT SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER. YES PLEASE MA'AM THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ED SHEERAN MEMBERS DAN AYKROYD ARMILLA BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- WELL WE APPRECIATE THIS STATEWIDE CONCERN REGARDING HOMELESSNESS AND THE URGENT NEED FOR SOLUTIONS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE SOLUTION STARTS WITH INCREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR COMPONENT OF OUR CULTURAL RECKONING BUT THE ROLE POLICING PLAYS IN OUR SOCIETY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS BEEN OUR OVER RELIANCE ON OFFICERS TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES THAT FREQUENTLY DO NOT REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT RATHER CRISIS RESPONSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND CARE. THESE RESPONSES REQUIRED DIFFERENT KIND OF TRAINING AND EXPERTISE NOT POLICE. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ANY PROPOSAL TO CREATE MORE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR POLICE SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED GIVEN THE RECENTLY REPORTED SHORTAGES OF OFFICERS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE UNDERSTAND THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT SEEK TO CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT WILL ALMOST INEVITABLY BE THE RESULT. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LOT OF LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT ARE ANTI HOMELESSNESS LAWS THAT CRIMINALIZE SURVIVAL BUT PUNISHING PEOPLE FOR DOING THINGS THAT AMOUNT TO EXISTING IN PUBLIC LIKE SITTING SLEEPING AND LOITERING. AND ONCE AGAIN LIKE EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LAWS DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETS BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ON THE STREETS SERVICES AND SUPPORT REQUIRES BUILDING TRUST AND UNFORTUNATELY HOMELESS FOLKS HAVE OFTEN HAD NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH LEADS TO A LACK OF TRUST. THEREFORE REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE ON THESE HOMELESS OUTREACH TEAMS IS MORE LIKELY TO HURT RATHER THAN HELP PEACE EFFORTS IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RESULT. IN PEOPLE WHO NEED THE OFFERED SERVICES REJECTING THEM DUE TO THE ASSOCIATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE OF THIS THE BILL MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPOSITE OF IT STATED A FACT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I BELIEVE WE HAVE ONE MORE LEAD OPPOSITION A WITNESS- SERRA REGNI. PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SHARED MY NAME IS SERRA REGNI I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF AN ISSUE JUSTICE PATIENT JUSTICE IS A STATEWIDE POLICY NONPROFIT THAT WORKS TO ACTIVATE THE POLITICAL POWER OF THOSE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY MASS INCARCERATION. WE USE EVIDENCE BASED ADVOCACY TO CREATE SOLUTIONS THAT ENSURE TRUE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL OF US. I WANT TO START BY EMPHASIZING WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD TODAY. REGARDLESS OF THE INTENTION PLEASE INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOUSES MASS RESULTING CRIMINALIZATION NOT ANY ACTUAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. WHAT CALIFORNIA'S IN THE LARGEST INCREASE IN HOUSES LESS OF ANY STATE IN TWENTY TWENTY A SIX POINT 8% JUMP WE NEED LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. WE ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE PRAGMATIC HOUSING FIRST MODEL WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY CALIFORNIA AS AN EFFECTIVE AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. THIS MODEL FOCUSES ON ESTABLISHING SAFE SECURE AFFORDABLE AND PERMANENT HOUSING BEFORE ASKING PEOPLE TO WORK ON THEIR OTHER CHALLENGES. THIS CENTER IS THE EMPOWERMENT AND STABILITY NECESSARY TO MAKE LASTING CHANGE. THIS BASELINE STRUCTURE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN NEW YORK DENVER HOUSTON SEATTLE AND ATLANTA. THIS BILL IS TREATING SYMPTOMS INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES NECESSARY TO MAKE LONG TERM PROGRESS IN MEANINGFUL CHANGE. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THE CAUSES OF HOUSES NICE LIKE RENT SURVIVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BEING FORMALLY INCARCERATED OR AGING OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THIS CHANGE IS ONE OF THE NECESSARY STEPS NEEDED TO MOVE AWAY FROM WHAT WE KNOW DOESN'T WORK USING CRIMINALIZATION AS A SOLUTION TO PUBLIC SAFETY. WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE AGAINST THIS MEASURE AND INVESTING TO PUBLIC SAFETY FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS. BRITNEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELEPHONE CONFERENCE COULD SERVICE. A MODERATE YOU WOULD PLEASE FROM THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF S. B. ONE ZERO ZERO SIX AND WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. ONE ZERO ZERO SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. ONE FILED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. MADAM CHAIR NOBODY IS QUEUING UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HEY NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE AND WE HAVE A CENTER WIENER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMORIES CHAIR- SO I- WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS BILL I HAD THE SAME CONCERNS A SEMI OPPONENT OPPOSITION WITNESSES HAD ABOUT MAKING A SECURE I'M VERY FOCUSED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT- WHEN YEAH WE KNOW THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS. NOT THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS AND INVITES- HAS THE AUTHOR AND I DISCUSS WHEN WE TALK TO POLICE OFFICERS- CERTAINLY NOT WHAT THEY'RE WANTING TO DO- THEY HAVE ACTUAL CRIMES TO- TO SALT- AND SO- I KNOW THAT THEIR AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE AND- MADAM CONSULTANT THAT. BUT WILL BE TAKEN ABOUT. CONFORMING S TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE- SANTIAGO BILL AS I READ ABOUT THAT YES THAT IS CORRECT AND I AM I AM ACCEPTING THOSE MA'AM OKAY GREAT. IN ADDITION- I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR- BUT I THINK WERE IN AGREEMENT DESPITE YOU CONFIRM- RIGHT NOW THE BILL'S SPONSOR SANTIAGO BILL HAD LIKE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM GOING OUT TO YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE. OUTREACH WORKERS IT'S BETTER PEOPLE WHO CAN ACTUALLY HELP OFFER SERVICES TRY TO TRANSITION PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO A STABLE SETTING GET THE HELP THEY NEED- AND- THE BILL AND IS CURRENTLY IS IN PRINT STATES THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. MUST BE PART OF THE TEAM AND MY TAKE AS I'VE EXPRESSED TO THE AUTHOR IS THAT THAT SHOULD BE OPTIONAL- FOR COUNTIES COUNTY SHALL BE OUT THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS. WHERE I COUNTY DECIDES THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENT OR AVAILABLE FOR IT BASED ON THE CONTEXT BECAUSE THERE ARE A MILLION DIFFERENT CONTACTS- BUT THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHERE. THEY EITHER DON'T WANT AN OFFICER PRESIDENT OR THERE'S NO OFFICER AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF STAFFING- AND BENEFITS AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE. YOU KNOW COUNTY GETS A GRANT UNDER THIS PROGRAM AND THEN THEY CAN ONLY IMPLEMENT IT IF THEY'D LIKE POLL PLEASE OFFICER OFF OF OFF OF THE B. THAT SHOULD BE A RESOURCE DECISION OF THE COUNTY MAKES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE WANT TO GIVE THEM- THAT FLEXIBILITY SO MY TAKE IS. ON WHAT I WOULD ASK IS THE IS THE AUTHOR WILLING TO AMEND THE BILL WOULD BE TODAY BUT AS IT MOVES TOWARDS APPROACH IF IT GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY- TO MAKE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ASPECT. OPTIONAL INSTEAD OF MANDATORY. SURE THE- AND THANK YOU FOR THE- AND WE- THIS YOU KNOW COLLEGE THAT YOU KNOW OUR GOAL- AND I HOPEFULLY LET. GOAL IS TO GET THE RESOURCES TO THE STREET AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE WITH AS- LITTLE BUREAUCRACY AS POSSIBLE- I CERTAINLY. DON'T WANT TO PRESCRIBE TO THE COUNTIES- EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED TO DO UNDER THIS SO IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN WORK THAT LANGUAGE INTO THE BILL AND THE AND THE- FUNDING STILL HAPPEN THEN ABSOLUTELY I'M OPEN TO THAT. AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THE COUNTIES CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES OF THE TEAMS CAN DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER THEY ACTUALLY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THERE OR NOT. OKAY SO THAT BY THE END OF THE SYSTEM TO BE CLEAR- I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE- AND THAT MAN BECAUSE THERE'S A SENSE OF SAYS I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME I'M SORRY- PRESS. DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION. THE BILL DECKER AND CURRENT FORM REQUIRES A LOT OF HIS SENTENCES YEAH- AL WHICH YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS CAN WE MAKE IT OPTIONAL AND I AM YES I'M SAYING YES WE CONDUCT AN OPTIONAL GREAT- I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY THE AMENDMENTS TO LINK IT TO THE SANTIAGO BILL CROSSED ALREADY SO THAT'S IN THAT'S IN THE BEDROOM BUT THIS AND THIS AMENDMENT- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE CONSULTANT WHO WORKED ON IT THAT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO YEAH. AND WE HAVE TO AND I THINK WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME YEAH THE TIME TIME TO DO IT FOR I SAID ON APPROPRIATIONS TO SELL THE HOUSE- SO WITH WITHOUT CHANGE THAT IT IT'S ALREADY BEEN AMENDED TO CONFORM TO THE SANTIAGO STRUCTURE AND MAKING THE LONG FOR SOME PEACE OPTIONAL TO ME THIS IS PROVIDING FNDING TO COUNTIES TO PROVIDE MORE L. REACH- TO GOD TO HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE AND I FULLY AGREE THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS IS- IT'S GOT MORE HOUSING AND- KEEPING PEOPLE STABLE IN HOUSING AND SO FORTH- BUT I I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. WITH THE COMMITMENT TO MAKE IT OUT PARTICULARS CHANGE. THANK YOU SIR AND I APPRECIATE. THE CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU- SORRY JONES I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE I KNOW THAT CURRENTLY IT- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO ARE STARTING TO- TOGETHER ALTERNATIVES FOR- IF A CALL COMES IN. THAT RELATES TO A HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL OR OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NEED DIFFERENT KINDS OF ASSISTANCE AND NOT REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE. HERE THAT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN AND THERE'S ALSO PILOT PROJECTS THAT THE BUDGET IS FUNDED IT'S NOT YET UNIVERSAL OF COURSE OR THAT YOU KNOW NEITHER IF WE SET UP AN INFRASTRUCTURE ADEQUATE. NOR IS THERE THE STAFFING ADEQUATE OR THE FUNDING ADEQUATE SO YOU KNOW CERTAINLY. ALEX WAS THERE GOING TO COME INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER MY THE ISSUES I HAVE ARE. IT BEHIND NUMBER OF WOMEN YOU KNOW PERHAPS THE DOWNFALL OF BEING A BUDGET YEARS- IT. WILD DEER OBVIOUSLY OUR DOJ. HAS A CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES OVER A LONG FORSMAN AGENCIES. WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHERE WE MIGHT HOW SUCH GRANT PROGRAM DOJ JUST BY ITS NATURE. DID THE KIND OF STAFFING IN SUCH IT HAS IS A FAR MORE EXPENSIVE ENTITY TO YOU KNOW IF IT IF THIS ACTION REQUIRES THEM TO WORK AT YOU KNOW HAVE MORE STAFF IT'S JUST IT'S JUST OF IT JUST COSTS MORE SO THAT'S ONE ISSUE. AND THEN ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT. THE YOU KNOW PART OF THE INTENT HERE IS TO PROVIDE. THE CARD TO SUPPORT STRUCTURES OR THE RESPONSES THAT ARE JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OF COURSE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT DOJ'S MILIEU EITHER- SO IT DID I'M NOT SURE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO REALLY URGE I WANT TO SAY PROPRIOCEPTION OF FEAR BUT RATHER IT IT'S BEST SUITED. TO PLACE TODAY DOJ. AND THEN- ADDITIONALLY WAIT. IF THE GRANTS I GUESS I WOULD RATHER SEE THE GRANT'S GOING TOWARDS THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR. YOU KNOW FOR THE EVEN THE CALLS TO GO TO A DIFFERENT PLACE NOW I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'RE IN THAT TRANSITION BUT- SO I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU AND THE SPONSORS ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN QUITE GET THERE IN THE WAY IT'S CONSTRUCTED RIGHT NOW. OKAY IF I CAN ADD TO TWO COMMENTS AND I THINK THIS ACTUALLY CAUSES SOME OF THE THINGS THE OPPOSITION SAID TO. YOU KNOW IN IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THE HOMELESS SITUATION YOU KNOW I'M I THINK WE ALL AGREES ADDING EMERGENCY STATUS- THE- DEPARTMENTS THE COMMITTEES. ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT YOU KNOW 30% OF AMERICANS HOMELESS PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE- THE OPPOSITION CREATED SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME VERY GOOD IDEAS. THERE THERE'S NOTHING IN MY BILL THAT I WOULD EVER SAY IS A- ONE SIZE FITS ALL OR IS THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION OR THE FINAL ANSWER. IT'S HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA I MEAN E'VE GOT A HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO IMPACT IN A POSITIVE WAY. THIS IS JUST ONE STEP ONE SMALL- BITE AT THE ELEPHANT I GUESS- FOR LACK OF A BETTER ANALOGY THAT- IS PURPOSELY SET UP COMPETITIVELY SO THE COUNTIES THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CAN'T COMPETE FOR THE GRANT TO GET IT IF THEY WANTED- AGAIN BACK TO YOU KNOW SOME SALUTE IDEAS YOU PRESENT AND THE OPPOSITION THOSE ARE GOOD IDEAS TO LET'S DO. LET'S DO ALL OF THEM LET'S LET'S BE CREATIVE IN CALIFORNIA LET'S LET THE COUNTIES. ALL WORK- AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT WORK FOR THEIR COUNTY AND THEN AS BEST WE CAN COMMUNICATE THOSE TO THE OTHER COUNTIES. SO THAT THE BEST IDEAS RISE TO THE TOP AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WE INSTITUTED PROCESS STATE. I THINK THAT THIS IS AGAIN IT IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S A SMALL COMPETITIVE GRANT THEN AGAIN ALLOWS COUNTIES. TO COMPETE FOR IT AND HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE ON THE SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN IMPACT IN A POSITIVE WAY WE PICKED D. O. J. BECAUSE UNDER OUR WITH OUR RESEARCH FELT LIKE THEY HAD THE BEST A SYSTEM ALREADY IN PLACE- THEY WERE MORE ABLE TO DO IT PASSED THROUGH. WITH THE GRANT FUNDING FROM THE% STATE TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITHOUT HIS HAVING TO GEAR UP AS MUCH AS MAYBE ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO DO I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO LOOKING AT OTHER SOLUTIONS AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW MAYBE WORKING ON ANOTHER BILL THAT. DOES A DIFFERENT KIND OF GRANT TO THE COUNTIES TO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP AND I THINK THAT- AS HAS BEEN SHARED BY ALL OF US LAW ENFORCEMENT IS FRUSTRATED WITH THE SITUATION AS WELL AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP AND I THINK THAT HELP COMES FROM THE OTHER PROFESSIONALS ARE ON THE TEAM. AND THAT PROVIDES A SAFETY FOR THE TEAM TO PROVIDE SAFETY FOR THE OFFICER WHEN THERE'S MORE EYEBALLS ON THE SITUATION- EVERYBODY. GETS TO. PERFORMING THEIR FOR CAPACITY. APOLOGIZE TO JUST LOST MY LITTLE MICROPHONE. OKAY THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE THE MIKE SILVERSTONE IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. YOUR P. IS WITHOUT THE- FROM ON. OKAY HERE WE GO- I GUESS IT'S JUST THE THREE OF US SO I AM GOING TO- MOVE FORWARD SO. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL. AND ACCORDING TO MY NOTES HERE IT SAYS THE HOMELESS OUTREACH TEAMS WOULD INCLUDE A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL COUNTY WELFARE PRESENTED IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER- I IN THIS I THINK WOULD BE MORE OF A COMPLIMENTARY AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER MORE OF A COMPLIMENTARY BILL TO ALL OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE- I WOULD I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS THAT AND MORE OF A COMPLIMENTARY AT PRACTICE. AND I HAVE TO- JUST SHARE FROM MY EXPERIENCE- FROM SPEAKING TO OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- OFFICERS AND DIFFERENT CITIES WITHIN MY DISTRICT THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN PLACE- THROUGH SOME OF OUR CITIES AND THEY HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY VERY BENEFICIAL TO HAVE SOMEBODY WITH A PROFESSIONAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE- PREPARATION. TO COME ALONG WHEN THEY'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE- HAVE- MENTAL HEALTH OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- ISSUES I THINK THAT IT GIVES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT A LITTLE BIT OF SECURITY KNOWING THAT THERE'S A PROFESSIONAL THERE WITH THEM. AND AND ALSO I THINK IT'S ALSO. SORT OF AND A PROTECTIVE CITING IT PROTECTS OUR OUR- MANY MANY. CONSTITUENTS WERE PARTIALLY ARE SUFFERING FROM BEHAVIOR HEALTH SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD COMPLEMENTARY PROGRAM TAB IT'S A THOUGHTFUL PROGRAM. AND YES WE DO HAVE SHORTAGES- JUST DROP CALIFORNIA. NEEDLESS TO SAY WHEN IT COMES TO BEHAVIOR HEALTH- PRACTITIONERS. AS WELL AS FUNDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT- MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS THAT ARE. HELPING OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH- RESIDENCE- ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WORK IN IN IN COMPANIONSHIP OR IN A COMPLIMENTARY MATTER I THINK IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA I WOULD ACTUALLY APPRECIATE. AND NOTHING IS PERFECT AND I ACT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT YOU SAID THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT THIS GIVES AN OPTION. FOR COUNTIES TO HAVE. ACCESS TO FUNDING THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM IF IT SUITS AND- THERE'S A NEED FOR THEM IN IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR COUNTY SO- I ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. AND IN AS I SAID EARLIER I SEE IT MORE AS A COMPLEMENTARY ADDITIONAL EFFORT TO SUPPLEMENT WHAT WE HAD TO WORK WORKING TOWARDS- SO THANK YOU SENATOR JONES FOR THAT. AND ON THAT. END DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SOME OF. WITH WITH THE CAN TO TAKE THAT AMOUNT IN APPROPRIATIONS ON THE BILL PERFECT- SENT JONES WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MEMBERS AYE APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND- LOOKING FORWARD TO- ALL OF US HAVING GOOD IDEAS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIAN ASK YOUR I. WILL.

PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CONGRATULATIONS SENATOR JONES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTERS PROCEDURE SUPPORT. WELCOME SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR HILL. S. B. ONE ZERO THREE EIGHT CAMANCHE YEAR AS WE WANT TO. R. S. B. TEN THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH BODY WORN CAMERA TECHNOLOGY AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB TWELVE FIFTEEN BUYS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM WHICH BANNED THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH CAMERAS WORN OR CARRIED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE BAN WAS- SET WITH SUNSET AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD AS WELL AS GROWING CONCERNS ABOUT THE SHORTCOMINGS IN THE SHOES PROMINENT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES LIKE MICROSOFT AMAZON AND IBM HAVE DECLINED TO SELL FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE LOS ANGELES TIMES REPORTED THAT THE LAPD HAD USE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND TIMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINE DESPITE YEARS OF VAGUE AND CONTRADICTORY INFORMATION THE POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE IS HIGH IT COULD FURTHER EXACERBATE RACIAL INEQUITIES AND OUR CRIMINAL pARE ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MEAN MISS ED MISIDENTIFIED. I WOULD FACE RECOGNITION THAN WHITE MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE INCLUDING ME- WAS IDENTIFIED AS A CRIMINAL- DURING A DEMONSTRATION- THE FACIAL RECOGNITION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN- WENTY SIX LEGISLATORS ALSO WHILE WERE IN THE DATABASE AS CRIMINALS- DUE TO MISIDENTIFICATION THIS BILL ARE AIMS TO ADDRESS ONE SUSPECTS SPECIFIC PART. OF THIS ISSUE OFFICERS WORE BODY CAMERAS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCAPABLE WITH FACIAL RECOGNITION IN PART BECAUSE OFFICERS ARE IN NEAR CONSTANT BECAUSE A WIDE RANGE ANGLE OF IMAGES IMAGES CALLS BULLARD AND LOW QUALITY IMAGES THAT FURTHER RESEARCH FALSE MATCHES A WRONGFUL. ARRESTS ACTION ON ONE OF THE LEAD FOR OF BY CAM FOR LOG. STATED IN A WRITTEN. BY THERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE- AT THE EXPORT FACIAL RECOGNITION. TECHNOLOGY IS NOT CURRENTLY RELIABLE ENOUGH TO F. ETHICALLY JUSTIFY THE USE OF BODY WORN CAMERAS AT LEAST FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE DEPLOYED UNTIL THE TECHNOLOGY PERFORMED. WITH FAR GREATER ACCURACY AND PERFORMS EQUALLY WELL ACROSS RACES ETHNICITIES GENDERS AND OTHER IDENTITY GROUPS THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT LIMITING TOOLS WHICH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN USE IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT TOO THAT THEY USE ARE RELIABLE AND A COUPLE. OF TESTIFIED ON IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY IS MATT CACKLE- STAFF ATTORNEY FOR ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND- HE WILL ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRAD WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE ARE. IS NOT ON THE LINE OR IS IN PERSON. BUILT ON A LIE OKAY PERFECT PLEASE- PROCEED. THE MORNING CARE NUMBERS MY NAME IS MATT CABLE IN THE TOP TWENTY WITH A HUGE BILL YOU LEARNING CALIFORNIA MY WORK FOCUSES ON ISSUES AT THE INTERSECTION- MAINLAND AND CIVIL RIGHTS. AND I'M SPEAKING FROM CAN SUPPORT TODAY AS SB TEN THIRTY EIGHT AT THREE TEN THIRTY MAKES PERMANENT AN ESSENTIAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW THAT PROTECTS CALIFORNIA. NEARLY THREE YEARS EXISTING ON SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT PREVENTING THE HARM THAT FACE. EVERYONE SOMEBODY CAN BY PROTECTING PRIVACY SAFEGUARDING OUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH HOPING THE PREVENTION OF MULTIPLE DATABASES AND HELPING PREVENT THE MISIDENTIFICATION AND WRONGFUL IMPRISONMENT IMPRISONMENT OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THESE PROTECTION DO NOT THANK THE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE PLACE ON OFFICER BODY CAMERAS BODY CAMERAS WERE INTENDED TO GUARD AGAINST POLICE MISCONDUCT NOT AT THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM FOR THE POLICE TO IDENTIFY AND TRACK CALIFORNIANS. I MEAN FACE SCANNING TECHNOLOGY TO BODY CAMERAS WOULD AUTOMATE THE FORCIBLE IDENTIFICATION AND PASILA TATE THE CREATION OF DATABASES THAT IMMIGRANT CASES. EITHER THE SAME DATABASES THAT I COULD ALREADY DEMANDED ACCESS TO IN OTHER STATES. SB TEN THIRTY WILL CONTINUE TO PREVENT CLOGS FACE AND BODY TRACKING SYSTEM FROM BEING USED AGAINST CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE CURRENT LAW WAS ENACTED FEDERAL RESEARCH HAS CONTINUED TO SHOWCASE A RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IN AN ACCURATE AND BY. GENERATING UP TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE CALLED HOUSES BUT WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. ONES HAVE NOT BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER STATES THAT PERMIT THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION MULTIPLE BLACK MEN HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO WRONGFUL ARREST. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT SKEWED AND CONSTANT MOVEMENT INHERENT IN BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE RAISES THE RISK OF THESE FALSE POSITIVES. PROMINENT TECH COMPANIES SUCH AS AMAZON MICROSOFT AND IBM HAVE REFUSED TO SELL FACIAL RECOGNITION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND AXON THE LARGEST BODY CAMERA MANUFACTURER HAS REFUSED TO ADD FACIAL RECOGNITION TO WITH THE POLICE DEVICES. ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT FACIAL RECOGNITION ON BODY CAMERAS. BUT THE RISKS ARE PARTICULARLY ACUTE IN COMMUNITIES WHERE POLICE MISCONDUCT REGULARLY THREATENS THE SAFETY OF BLACK PEOPLE LATINOS AND IMMIGRANTS. THIS BILL ENSURES THE CONTINUED PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR THESE COMMUNITIES AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO VúI ON SB TEN THIRTY EIGHT. THANK YOU.

TO DEPRIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OF TOOLS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND EIGHT INVESTIGATIONS. IF THERE ARE JUSTIFIABLE CONCERNS ABOUT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGIES AND THEIR USAGE DISCUSSIONS AMONG LOCAL COMMUNITIES LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE STAKEHOLDERS CAN BE HAD- HOWEVER TO MAKE PERMANENT WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY A BLANKET BAN ON PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY- LIMITS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S FXE AND RESTRICTS ITS ABILITY TO MEET ITS INVESTIGATORY. AND CRIME PREVENTION AND SOLVING MANDATES- OFFICER CAMERAS DO MORE THAN FOSTER ALONE FORSMAN ACCOUNTABILITY ARE THEY CAN PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INVESTIGATIVE ASSISTANCE IN IDENTIFYING SUSPECTS AND EXONERATING ON INVOLVED PERSONS.

WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT POOL WHILE I UNDERSTAND FULLY THAT THE CONCERN THAT THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS I FIND THE CORE ISSUE OF THIS BILL TO BE WITH HUMAN ERROR. FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY SHOWS PROMISE AS A TOOL FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ESTABLISHING IDENTITY THROUGH FINGERPRINTS. AND DNA. I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PUT IN PLACE A PERMANENT BAN. ON THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE ON BODY CAMERAS AT THIS TIME WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN EVEN GIVEN THE TECHNOLOGY THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE AND IMPROVE. WE'RE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON WHAT MIGHT OCCUR WITH THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN LIEU OF MAKING THIS TECHNOLOGY MORE EFFECTIVE THE BILL WILL INSTEAD KIRBY INNOVATION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS SHOWN GREAT PROMISE IN SOME INSTANCES. OF BEING AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. MY STAFF MET WITH THE GROUP WHO SPOKE OF HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN USED TO IDENTIFY A SERIAL CHILD RAPIST AND ALLOW POLICE TO SAVE THAT YOUNG CHILD FROM A TERRIBLE SITUATION. WE SHOULD FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE OBVIOUS FLAWS IN FACIAL RECOGNITION AND BIOMETRIC SCANNING SOFTWARE IN ORDER TO CREATE A BETTER SYSTEM. THAT BALANCES THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC WITH ESSENTIAL RIGHTS TO PRIVACY. FREEDOM AND DUE PROCESS. RATHER THAN PERMANENTLY BANNING THESE POTENTIAL. OUT USEFUL TECHNOLOGIES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON REGULATING THEIR USE IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY. AND LIBERTIES OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE F. IF EFFICACY OVERSTATES PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORKS FOR THE RE REFER FOR THESE REASONS I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. ON THAT END SENATOR COME UP OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. NO. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION BY CENTERS THAT WE WILL HAVE. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE SCHOOLS. I APOLOGIZE CENTER PROFFER YES PLEASE THANK YOU THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DILLON WHAT WHAT MIGHT OCCUR IT SPECIFICALLY DEALS WITH WHAT HAS OCCURRED AND IT'S TO AN ACCURACY OF BODY CAM FACIAL RECOGNITION THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM USING STANDARD FACIAL RECOGNITION AND A DATABASE OF IDENTIFYING SUSPECTS AS IS BEING USED ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY IT DOESN'T STIFLE INNOVATION WHATSOEVER THIS BILL ADDRESSES WHAT YOUR CONCERNS ARE. ALLOWING THE TECHNOLOGY TO EVOLVE TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS RELIABLE RIGHT NOW AGAIN TWENTY SIX MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE INCLUDING ME WAS IDENTIFIED AS A CRIMINAL USING BODY CAL FACIAL RECOGNITION THE- PITCHERS. AND IMAGES THAT ARE CAPTURED ON A BODY CAMERA ARE NOWHERE NEAR THE SAME AS A STEEL ARE HELD UP CAMERA TAKING A PICTURE OF SOMEONE IT IS A DIFFUSED PITCHER AT AT STATED MANY TIMES OFFICERS. ARE IN CONSTANT MOVEMENT SO IT'S BETTER TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION WHICH THIS BILL CLEARLY IS TRYING TO DO IT DOES NOT STIFLE LEGACY INNOVATION IN ANY KIND OF WAY IT DOESN'T LIMIT THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IT. CREATES THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN WHICH MANY MEMBERS SAY THEY'RE CONCERNED BECAUSE AGAIN IF IT WAS YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER OR YOURSELF WHO IS IDENTIFIED AS A CRIMINAL I THINK YOU WOULD BE CONCERNED AS WELL THE FOR THOSE REASONS AND THOSE REASONS AND MANY MORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE BRADFORD- THE- CANCEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
