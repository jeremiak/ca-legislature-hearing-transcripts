00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:14.807

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.561
CRISIS.

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:36.763
ALTHOUGH WE MADE SOME PROGRESS

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.164
IN LOWERING AT RESTRICTIONS WITH

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:41.167

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:49.008

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.576
THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER AND ARE

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:51.811

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.279
THAT TRIGGER INCREASE SERVICES

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:54.480

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:56.949
THAT 25% CHARGE FOR EIGHTY USE

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.484
OVER CENTER FIFTY SQUARE FEET

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.419
IT'S A FAIR COMPROMISE FOR BOTH

AGENCIES AND HOMEOWNER.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:02.789

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.024
THAT 25% OF NOTHING IS NOTHING

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.827
SO IF WE PUT THE IMPACT FEE TOO

00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:09.662

EIGHTY USE WE I DO SUPPORT AT IS

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:49.495
ON A REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.630
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE OVER THE

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.599
PAST FEW YEARS -- BUT WE DO. FOR

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:54.500
TODAY I'LL FOCUS ON OWNER

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:56.235
OCCUPANCY WE DO HAVE CONCERNS

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:57.236
WITH THE REMOVAL OF ON OUR

00:08:57.303 --> 00:08:59.372
OCCUPANCY WRIST RAT RESTRICTIONS

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.307
THAT CAN BE APPLIED -- NOT

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.275
BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO BE A

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.609
BARRIER TO EIGHTY USE BUT WE DO

00:09:03.676 --> 00:09:05.011
BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.513
TOOLS THAT CAN HELP ENCOURAGE

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.681
AFFORDABILITY FOR EIGHTIES.

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.249

USED TO BE AFFORDABLE HOWEVER AS

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:14.887
I SAID I THINK HONOR OCCUPANCY

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:15.688
CAN BE ONE TOOL THAT

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:17.189
JURISDICTION'S CAN USE TO HELP

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:18.824
ENCOURAGE THAT.

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.159
THE HOMEOWNER IS LIKELY MORE

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.928
LIKELY TO RENT OUT THERE AT YOU

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:23.462
AT AN AFFORDABLE RENT -- AND

REQUIREMENTS -- DOES CONCERN APA

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.402
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THE

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.636
POTENTIAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.571
INVESTORS AND OTHERS TO COME IN

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.107

WELL THERE AND WE ARE VERY

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.715
CONCERNED -- THAT THAT COULD

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.250
HAPPEN WITH THE OWNER OCCUPANCY

PLEX IS AND ALL OF THOSE UNITS

00:09:55.494 --> 00:09:57.496
TO HAVE -- AND THEN POTENTIALLY

00:09:57.563 --> 00:09:59.265
IF THEY HAVE REDUCED OR NO

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:01.033
IMPACT FEES THERE'S REALLY A BIG

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.969
INCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPERS TO COME

IN AND DO THIS -- AND WE ALSO AS

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.640
JURISDICTIONS DO USE -- OWNER

00:10:07.707 --> 00:10:10.543
OCCUPANCY AS WAY TO ENCOURAGE --

00:10:10.609 --> 00:10:12.178

A MAJOR HURDLE FOR US -- WE

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.183
CITIES CANNOT MAKE MONEY ON

BOTH WAYS IF PEOPLE ARE MOVING

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.095
INTO OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.696

WOULD SET WOULD INSTRUCT --

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.694
STANDARDS TO BE MADE FOR EIGHTY

00:16:35.761 --> 00:16:36.862

TO DO WITH CHILD -- TWENTY FOUR

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:42.501
WITH THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IT'S

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:44.370
IT'S IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:46.205
BUILD BUT THE THE REAL BAD STUFF

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.474
IS GOING TO BE LET THE CITIES IN

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.908

BUILDING REAL BILL.

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:06.925
OF ACTIVITIES LIKE WE WERE

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:07.826
TALKING ABOUT.

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:10.462

THAT KIND OF FUNDING.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.635
OF FOR CITIES TO COME IN AND AND

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:20.205
USE -- PROP ONE PROCEEDS FOR

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.874
REHABILITATION.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.575
CODE COMPLIANCE.

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:25.077
THE MORE CO COMPLIANCE WE CAN

00:17:25.144 --> 00:17:26.478
GET TO SAY FOR COMMUNITIES HAVE

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.981
OUT WILL BE CALM I THINK THAT'S

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.283
SO IN TERMS OF LIKE EIGHTY USE

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.518
IF THERE.

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:36.321
IS A SENSE THAT THERE IS -- IN

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:37.689
IN CITIES LIKE SAN JOSE I KNOW

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:40.192
IT'S TRUE I ASSUME IT MIGHT BE

00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:44.062
TRUE IN OTHER CITIES -- A LOT OF

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:46.231
THESE ILLEGAL STRUCTURES THAT WE

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:47.599
WANT TO BRING IN.

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:50.502
AND TURN INTO LEGAL STRUCTURES.

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.104
OF MAYBE THE CITIES AND THE

00:17:52.171 --> 00:17:53.906
PLANNERS CAN COMMENT ON THAT

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:56.241
BECAUSE I THINK EIGHTY YOU LAW.

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.577
WOULD FACILITATE.

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:01.580
CO COMPLIANCE AND BUILDING

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.849
APPLICATIONS TO REHAB SOME AND

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:06.351
AND AND FIX UP SOME OF THESE.

00:18:06.418 --> 00:18:07.953
STRUCTURES THAT ARE ALREADY OUT

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.621
THERE AND THAT'S A GOOD THING.

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:10.989
SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT THAT

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.192

OTHER THINGS -- IN IN THAT

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.926
COMMUNITY THAT YOU COULD SAY ARE

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:56.261
CERTAINLY OFFSETTING WHATEVER

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:58.463
WHATEVER FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.265
BUT THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS SET

00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:01.900
UP THERE THERE ISN'T REALLY A

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:04.836
NEXUS BETWEEN THE THE COMMUNITY

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.137
THAT'S GETTING THAT ADDITIONAL

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.739
MANUFACTURING THE JOBS.

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.807
AND THOSE WHERE THE EQUIPMENT IS

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:13.011
COMING FROM -- IN SO WE'D LIKE

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:14.412
TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK ON

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.181
THIS BILL TO SEE IF WITH THERE'S

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:18.283
A WAY TO TO TIGHTEN UP THE NEXUS

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:20.752
BETWEEN -- THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:22.720
THAT THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM

00:30:22.787 --> 00:30:25.590
THIS -- IS A AND AND AND AND THE

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:27.492
PROGRAM -- FOR THAT YOU KNOW YOU

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.227
HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S OVER HALF

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:31.062
A BILLION DOLLARS OF IMPACT ON

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.997
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT IS SOMETHING

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:35.300
THAT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD A

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.534
SLOW DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK AT

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:38.102
WHEN THIS PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:39.837
WENT THROUGH WENT THROUGH.

00:30:39.904 --> 00:30:41.606
IT WAS - VERY WENT WENT VERY

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:43.441
QUICKLY THERE WASN'T MUCH IN THE

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:49.948
WAY OF HEARINGS AND AND THE THE

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.516
IMPACTS OF OF THIS ON LOCAL BUT

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.917
WE'RE NEVER REALLY ANALYZED SO
--

00:30:52.984 --> 00:30:53.952
THIS TIME AROUND I THINK IT

00:30:54.018 --> 00:30:55.720
WOULD GIVEN THE THE THAT THE LA

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:56.788
OWES -- ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT

00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:57.355
THE IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:58.590
LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S GOING TO

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:00.291
SHOULDER THE THE THE FINANCIAL

00:31:00.358 --> 00:31:02.060
WAY TO THIS PROGRAM -- IT'S

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:03.628
WORTH A TAKEN OUT TAKE A LOOK AT

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.730

YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY.

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:07.592

TAX HAS BEEN EXCLUDED OVER TIME

00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:11.529
YEAH WHAT WEALTHY PASSES FOR THE

THE PROGRAM IS A LIMITED TO IS A

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.039
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.941
TAX EXCLUSION TO AWARD EACH

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:25.677
OF THAT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:28.413
IT PROBABLY GETS -- USE SO IT'S

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.181
NOT FUNDS THAT WE'RE GIVING AWAY

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:30.815
IT'S JUST FUNDS WERE NOT

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:31.616
COLLECTING.

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:33.184
SO IT'S THAT SPENDS IT ON A

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:36.287
QUICK MATT THAT'S PURCHASED OVER

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:37.555
THREE TO FIVE YEARS -- AND NOT

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:38.456
ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THOSE

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:40.024
COMPANIES WILL USE ALL OF THEIR

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:42.126

SOME AWARDS DON'T END UP BEING

00:32:46.764 --> 00:32:48.933
USE SO THERE IS A LIMIT OF A

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.335
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND AND

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:51.602
SALES AND USE TAXES LOSING EACH

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.371
YEAR I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:56.374
SENT TO THE ST IMPACT YOUR THAT

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:57.575
IS A COMBINED STATE AND LOCAL.

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.811
THE AVERAGE IS ABOUT EIGHT POINT

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:02.480
42% -- ON AVERAGE STATEWIDE OF

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:03.715
STATE AND LOCAL BECAUSE

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:06.484

L. A. L. A. AND ADDRESSING

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:24.869

THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

SO -- SO AS AS A KID FOR

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:37.448
REPRESENTATIVE NOTED THERE IS A

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:39.751
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL.

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:40.885
CAP ON THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE.

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:43.488
THE AMOUNT OF EXCLUSIONS THAT

00:33:43.554 --> 00:33:47.291
CAN BE AWARDED IN ANY GIVENYEAR
--

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:50.194
AS WE DESCRIBE IN OUR ANALYSIS
--

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:52.730
IN OUR IN IN A REPORT FROM

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:54.799
DECEMBER -- US QUITE A

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.534
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:58.603
LIKELY WOULD BE -- CLAIMED

00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:59.337
ANYWAY THROUGH DIFFERENT

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:02.774
PROGRAMS TO REALLY THE NET --

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.042
REVENUE A FAX FROM A STATE

00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.577
GENERAL FUND STANDPOINT LIKELY

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:07.345
IS.

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:10.615
IS FAIRLY SMALL AND AND REALLY

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.550
IT'S IT'S IT'S MOSTLY WE WE

00:34:12.617 --> 00:34:13.985
WOULD MOSTLY HIGHLIGHT A SORT OF

00:34:14.051 --> 00:34:15.953
ON THE REVENUE FOREGONE REVENUE

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.857
SIDE -- THE FOR GONE LOCAL SALES

00:34:19.924 --> 00:34:22.026
TAX REVENUES THAT THAT -- THE

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:23.127
LEAGUE OF CITIES REPRESENTATIVE

00:34:23.194 --> 00:34:24.529
REFERENCE THAT WOULD BE SORT OF

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:27.698
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IN TOTAL OF

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.300
UP.

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:30.868
TO ABOUT FIFTY FIVE MILLION A

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:33.271
YEAR THAT ASSUMES.

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:34.539
THAT WOULD ASSUME FOR FULL

00:34:34.605 --> 00:34:38.109
UTILIZATION WHICH IS PROBABLY.

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:39.277
UNREALISTIC SO PROBABLY IT WOULD

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:41.179
BE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THAT

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:43.781
PERHAPS SOMEWHERE IN THE IN THE

00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:46.017
MADE TENS OF OF MILLIONS PER

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:46.751
YEAR.

00:34:46.818 --> 00:34:48.352
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER FOR THE STATE

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.720
GENERAL FUND.

00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:52.390
ON IT'S SO WE DIDN'T HAVE DATA

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.358
THAT WERE ABLE TO QUANTIFY THE

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.594
X. FULL EXTENT OF THE OERLAP

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:59.297
BETWEEN THE PARTIAL EXEMPTION IN

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.165
THE IN THE CASE FOR EXCLUSION --

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:02.533
BASED ON THE INFORMATION WE

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.801
GATHERED WE THINK IT'S QUITE

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:06.237
LARGE SO YOU COULD REASONABLY

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:08.172
ASSUME THE GENERAL FUND IMPACT

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:11.642
IS IN THE MILLIONS TO MAYBE.

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.478
IT JUST JUST PROBABLY MAYBE

00:35:13.544 --> 00:35:16.414
SEVERAL MILLION TO PERHAPS TEN

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:19.484
MILLION A YEAR.

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.018
IF I CAN CLARIFY ONE THING IN

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.820
OUR AFTER THERE'S A LOT OF

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:24.822
THINGS TO CLARIFY -- BUT WE HAVE

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:27.625
WORKED WITH BOTH DâN AND SAT IN

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:29.460
THEIR ANALYSIS AND AND CONCERNS

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:31.762
OVER THE PROGRAM -- I WOULD

00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:33.464
THINK IN IN LIGHT OF THE LA OWES

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:36.501
REPORT -- THE SIMPLIFICATION

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:37.034
THAT THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.870
SIMILAR -- I WOULD SAY IS AN

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:41.506
OVERSIMPLIFICATION I'M SINCE

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:42.173
TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE STATE WIDE

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.774
PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED HE WAS

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:46.077
ACTUALLY HAVE FULLY AWARDED.

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.311
THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.113
CALENDAR YEAR THAT IS NOT

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.615
SOMETHING THAT WE EXPECTED WE

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.749
EXPECTED THAT WHEN THERE WAS A

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:53.084
PURE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.785
PROVIDED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:55.853
NOT ONE THAT REQUIRED A NET

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.054
BENEFIT NOT.

00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:58.256
AS I'VE BEEN TOLD A RIGOROUS

00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:00.124
EVALUATION THAT REQUIRES FEES IN

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.627
PROACTIVE NESS -- THAT WE WOULD

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:04.829
STILL BE ACTIVE AND THERE'S TO

00:36:04.896 --> 00:36:06.631
BE A DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM WHAT

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:08.966
WE ARE FINDING IS THAT THE

00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:10.902
VOLATILITY IN THE INDUSTRY AND

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:11.769
SOME OF THOSE NASCENT

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.037
TECHNOLOGIES.

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.505
AS THEY COME IN THAT DEEPER AND

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:15.907
SIGN UP FOR BOTH THE STATE AND

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.742
LOCAL LEVEL -- DOES HAVE A BIG

00:36:17.808 --> 00:36:20.578
IMPACT I THINK WHAT WE ARE ALSO

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:21.579
FINDING IS IN THE WAY THAT THE

00:36:21.646 --> 00:36:23.614
CAPE A CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATES

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.550
THE POSITIVE FISCAL BENEFIT OF

00:36:25.616 --> 00:36:26.384
THESE PROJECT.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.185
THERE ARE IS A CARRY OVER TO

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.787
BOTH NOT ONLY THOSE THE LOCATION

REASONS THAT THE THAT THE ANSWER

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.025
IS FUZZY IS SO THIS IS CERTAINLY

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.460
A QUESTION THAT WAS OF GREAT

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:23.661
INTEREST TO US AS WELL.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:24.962
DISCUSSED IT WITH VARIOUS

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:25.896
ENTITIES WITHIN THE

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:27.131
ADMINISTRATION AND IT'S OUR

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:28.632
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT SERVES TO

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.034
HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY.

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:30.968
THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:34.939
ADMINISTERED THAT THERE'S NOT --

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:37.908
DATA THAT COULD JUST SORT OF

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:40.377
READILY IDENTIFY IT SORT OF A

00:39:40.444 --> 00:39:43.447
VERY FINE LEVEL OF PRECISION --

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.782
THEY COULD AT LEAST THAT WAS

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:47.251
AVAILABLE TO US THAT COULD.

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.253
SEE SORT OF ENABLE SORT OF A

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.788
SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON OF

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.557
EXACTLY WHAT PURCHASES WERE

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.359
BEING USED -- IN EACH PROGRAM

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:56.660
THAT WOULD ENABLE THAT TYPE OF

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:58.395
ESTIMATES I THINK I'M NOT SURE

00:39:58.462 --> 00:39:59.463
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.865
MAKE MORE PRECISE N A QUICK

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:01.766
TIMETABLE I THINK.

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:03.934
FRANKLY IT MIGHT REQUIRE SOME

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:06.170
CHANGES TO SERVE TAX

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:08.072
ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES PERHAPS

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:10.107
EVEN A CHANGES IN STATURE TO

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:13.177
THAT EFFECT TO REALLY GET A VERY

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:14.445
PRECISE ESTIMATE.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.880
WITH WITH S. SAID ABOUT WHAT I'D

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.281
LIKE TO BE A TO DO IS A

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.016
COMMITMENT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:19.650
ABLE TO GET HIM OUR BEST

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:20.718
ESTIMATE.

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.953
IF IT'S NOT HERE TODAY.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.055
BY LATE THIS WEEK AT FIRST THING

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:25.956
NEXT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:27.658
IMPORTANT QUESTION AT THE CENTER

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:29.794
IS ASKING AND WOULD LIKE TO BE

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.329
TO GET THAT -- THROUGH GOT IN

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.365
FIVE STAFF YES PLEASE -- MY AND

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:34.999
COOK WITH VARYING YOU'RE

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:36.367
INCLINED PHARMACEUTICALS WE WERE

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.601
AND AWARD.

00:40:37.668 --> 00:40:39.904
JUST TO CLARIFY SOME OF THIS I

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.472
THINK THERE.

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:43.774
YOUR UNDER THIS PRESUMPTION

00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:44.875
YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVERYTHING WE

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:47.178
PURCHASED IS GOING TO BE LOCAL

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.013
AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE -- WERE

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.581
A BIO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY IN

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:53.350
FREMONT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.618
MANUFACTURING IN THE STATE OF

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:57.454
CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT.

00:40:57.521 --> 00:40:59.290
GENERALLY PURCHASE THINGS EVEN

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:01.058
WITHIN THE STATE WITH IN ANOTHER

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:03.394
STATE OR GOES TO ANOTHER
COUNTRY.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.763
SO THE SALES TAX WAS ISN'T GOING

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.565
TO TAKE PLACE HERE BECAUSE

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:12.203
THEY'RE NOT EQUIPPED WITH MAKING

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:14.004
WHAT WE NEED.

00:41:14.071 --> 00:41:14.672
THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER

TO THE GOOD CENTER FRANCE HAS A

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:18.609
MISCARRIAGE.

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.678
STRUCTURE ALL ON THAT POINT.

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:22.680
SHE IS SO THEY EVEN THOUGH THE

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:24.615
IF IF THE IF THEY BALK OF THE

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:26.183
PURCHASES ARE EITHER OUT OF

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.719
STATE OR OUT OF THE COUNTRY THEN

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.387
CLEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT HERE

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:32.523
IS A LOCAL REVENUE LOSS THAT YOU

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.491
THAT'S NOT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:35.626
IS BENEFITING.

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.127
IT THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:38.896
WHAT IS THE BENEFIT TO THE LOCAL

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.130
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:44.668
CONTRIBUTING -- BUT THE SO SO

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:46.403
THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.372
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED OUT ON MY

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:49.340
CLEARLY IF THERE WERE SOME

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.242
BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA JOBS OR

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.576
SOMETHING -- YOU KNOW MAYBE

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:53.978
THERE'S A BROADER ARGUMENT TO

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.512
MAKE BUT THAT'S ANOTHER LEVEL OF

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:57.915
OUR CONCERN IS IF A LOT OF THIS

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.216
EQUIPMENTS COMING FROM
ELSEWHERE.

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:01.218
AND WE ARE POTENTIALLY AGAIN I I

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.520
KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD BE

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:05.222
UP BUT IF THE AUTHORITY IS TO UP

00:42:05.289 --> 00:42:09.293
TO A BILLION THE END AND OUR

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:09.927
CONTRIBUTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:10.694
IS.

00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:12.596
A HALF A BILLION IT'S JUST
WORTH.

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:14.198
MAKING SURE WE KNOW WHAT THE THE

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:16.600
BENEFITS ARE.

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:18.168

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:33.117
OF FIGURING OUT AND WHAT WE DO

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:34.685
JUST DOES A PRACTICE.

DEFENDING HOMES THAT ARE OUT IN.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.185
HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS WORSE THIS

THE YOU SEE HERE IN SUPPORT OF

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:44.300
THIS EFFORT REALLY SPEAK FAR

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:47.103
MORE THAN -- I CAN DESCRIBE IN

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.938
TWO MINUTES IN TERMS OF THE

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:54.177
A FOR THE PERSPECTIVE OF NOT

00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:55.912
MAKING UP OUR CHALLENGES WORSE I

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:58.281
THINK THAT -- IT IS A IN THE

00:56:58.348 --> 00:57:00.416
ENTIRELY.

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:02.786
MODEST APPROACH WITH THOSE THAT

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:03.353
COME FORWARD AND SAY THAT WE

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:05.021
SHOULD NOT -- PROHIBIT BUILDING

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.090
ANYWHERE AND THAT'S JUST SIMPLY

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:10.560
NOT A PRACTICAL WAY -- TO KEEP

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:11.828
PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY AND THE

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:12.896
KEEPER FIREFIGHTERS OUT OF

00:57:12.962 --> 00:57:13.830
HARM'S WAY THAT'S JUST AND

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.098
OURSELVES UP.

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:18.234
FOR ADDITIONAL LOSSES AND WE

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:19.235
NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL THERE --

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:20.804
I SHOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS ONE

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.305
PROVISION AT THE END OF THE BILL

GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND WE

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:39.689
THINK WE SHOULD FIND A DIFFERENT

00:57:39.756 --> 00:57:40.924
WAY TO PAY FOR SOME OF THOSE

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.826

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.695
THAT.

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.363
ALONG WITH CAPITOL PARK WE HAVE

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:30.466
MCKINLEY PARK LAND PARK THAT NOW

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.468
BECOMES A PROBLEM FOR OUR

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.970
PROJECTS AS WERE BUILDING

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.605
HOUSING IN THESE AREAS THAT ARE

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.606
DANCE.

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:40.543
MULTI FAMILY PROJECTS -- THOSE

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.844
ARE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THE

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:44.747
STATE WANTS US TO BUILD THAT

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.215
BECOMES AN OBSTACLE.

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:49.418
THAT IS OVERBROAD AND MAKES THE

01:04:49.485 --> 01:04:50.453
BILL UNWORKABLE.

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:52.989
I WANT TO IT UNDERSCORE THE FACT

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.324
THAT THIS BILL ALONG WITH MANY

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.792
OTHERS THAT HAVE.

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.694
PRECEDED.

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.296
HAVE TAKEN THE APPROACH.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:02.164
THAT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.766
THERE'S NO PERFECT PLACE IN

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.735
CALIFORNIA TO BUILD.

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.336
AND THIS BILL IT'S WILDFIRES IN

01:05:07.403 --> 01:05:09.572
OTHERS IT'S SEISMIC IN OTHERS

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.807
IT'S DISPLACEMENT GENTRIFICATION

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:14.076
AG LAND PRESERVATION HABITAT

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.879
CONSERVATION WETLANDS TOXICS.

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.682
YOU NAME IT EVERYBODY'S GOT AN

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.083
ISSUE.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.086
SO IN LESS WE STOP FOCUSING

01:05:24.153 --> 01:05:25.521
SOLELY ON ONE SIDE OF THE

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.189
EQUATION AND GIVE SUFFICIENT

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.925
BALANCE THE CREATION OF MORE

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:32.194
HOUSING. FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.497
NEED SHELTER WE'RE ONLY GOING TO

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.532
PROLIFERATE THE HOUSING CRISIS

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.035
THAT HAS LESS TO A DEFICIT OF

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.436
THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOMES.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:41.704
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THESE

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.105
AREAS?

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.340
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAND USE

01:05:44.407 --> 01:05:46.175
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW FOR TWENTY SIX

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.910
YEARS I READ THE BILL MULTIPLE

01:05:47.977 --> 01:05:50.479
TIMES I CAN'T FIGURE OUT FROM

01:05:50.546 --> 01:05:53.382
THE BILL WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:54.517
THOSE AREAS.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.886
THERE'S LOTS OF CROSS REFERENCES

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:59.221
TO VARIOUS NON REGULATORY

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.590
REGIMES THE EITHER AND DON'T

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:04.827
EXIST AT ALL OR ONLY EXIST IN A

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.295
FEW PLACES.%

01:06:06.362 --> 01:06:08.097
THAT MAKES THIS BILL SOMETHING

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:09.699
THAT WE CAN'T DETERMINE HOW TO

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:12.068
PLAN DESIGN OR CONSTRUCT A

01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:14.437
PROJECT IN WHATEVER AREA IT

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:15.838
APPLIES.

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.606
TO THAT TURNS IT INTO SIMPLY A

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.141
GAME OF GOTCHA.

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:20.476
THAT'LL DISRUPT PROJECTS THAT

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:22.211
ALREADY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF

01:06:22.278 --> 01:06:26.615
APPROVAL AND PLAN FOR HOUSING.

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:29.185
YOU PROBABLY THINK IN.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.553
WHO IS THIS INSENSITIVE JERK

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:32.521
THAT'S COMING UP HERE AND SAYING

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.222
YOU KNOW DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.024
WILDFIRES ARE IMPORTANT?

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.760
I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY DAUGHTER

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.695
WAS CAUGHT IN THE THOMAS FIRE.

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.230
FOUR NIGHTS WE DIDN'T SLEEP

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.299
WONDERING IF SHE ALIVE IS SHE

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:45.935
NOT ALIVE SHE LOST THERE THE LOS

01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:47.536
CELL PHONE TOWERS THEY LOST

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:48.504
POWER.

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:50.106
AND SHE IS STATE WITH THE

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.374
CLOTHES ON HER BACK IN AFTER

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.510
BEING EVACUATED THREE TIMES

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:55.244
EVENTUALLY CAME HOME.

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:56.112
HOW CAN I ARGUE FOR HOUSING

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.780
HAVING HAD THAT EXPERIENCE I

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.915
ALSO WANT A PLACE FOR HER TO

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:02.318
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA?

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:05.121
AND I THINK WE NEED TO ALWAYS.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:07.456
KEEP IN MIND WE NEED A PATHWAY

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.125
FORWARD FOR HOUSING.

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.794
WE NEED A PLACE FOR HOUSING.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.863
IF YOU SAY NO ONE ONE AREA YOU

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.164
NEED TO REMOVE OBSTACLES IN

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:16.866
ANOTHER.

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:18.968
WE'VE DONE THE ANALYSIS IN THE

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:20.069
DATA.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.338
OF THE DATA FROM THESE FIRES

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.206
YOU'LL NOTE.

01:07:24.273 --> 01:07:25.741
THAT THE HOMES THAT WERE BURNED

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:28.344
OR ONES THAT WEREN'T COMPLIANCE

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.346
WITH EXISTING THE RIGHT EXISTING

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:31.847
REGULATORY REGIME.

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:33.816
THAT IS THEY WERE EITHER NOT IN

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.818
VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.087
OWNS OR WEREN'T BUILT AT A TIME

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:41.190
WHEN THE LATEST CODES APPLIED.

01:07:41.257 --> 01:07:42.925
SO WE'VE DONE THAT ANALYSIS YOU

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:44.560
CAN DO IT JUST BY LOOKING ON THE

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.429
INTERNET THIS IS A BILL THAT

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:49.131
FOCUSES ALMOST ENTIRELY.

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:51.033
ON NEW DEVELOPMENT.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.035
THAT'S THE NATURE OF PLANNING

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.503
AND LAND USE LAW.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.605
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T GO BACK

01:07:56.672 --> 01:07:58.274
TO EXISTING RESIDENTS. FOR THE

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.775
MOST PART THERE IS SOME

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:01.744

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:05.214
AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:08.050
HAVING SAID THAT AS IT STANDS WE

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.318
FIND THE BILL TO BE UNWORKABLE

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.853
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

A PARADISE COMMUNITY THAT NOW

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.728
HAS TO REBUILD ALMOST FROM

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.198
SCRATCH.

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.511
THE PURPOSE OF A THE PUBLIC

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:30.645
SAFETY ELEMENT OF A JOURNAL

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:31.847
PLANNED SO.

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:35.851
SO -- I THINK THE THE ONE OF THE

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:36.618
AREAS OF PROBABLY NEEDS A LITTLE

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:39.488
WORK OR ARTICULATION THIS BILL.

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.056
IS THE BECAUSE I'M SHERMAN OF

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.491
THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:43.625
LOOKED AT THIS.

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.861
IS THE TRANSPORTATION AND

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.829
CIRCULATION.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:50.966
PROBLEMS IN HEART AND FIRE.

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.367
HI FIRE AREAS.

01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:55.003
OF THE DEAD END STREETS ISSUES

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:56.271
ONE YOU SHOULD UP TWO POINTS OF

01:17:56.338 --> 01:18:01.176
ACCESS -- ANOTHER -- ONE BASED

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:05.047
ON OUR EXPERIENCE IN OUR AREA IS
--

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:07.716
IT ACTUALLY IS IS A PROBLEM IN

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.551
GETTING AMONG THE REDWOOD TREES

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.186
AND ALL THE BIG TREES OF PEOPLE

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:12.687
LOVE TO LIVE UP THERE.

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.356
AMONG THOSE TREES BUT WHAT THE

01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:17.793
TREES DO IS THEY BECAUSE

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:19.227
DIFFICULTY IN GETTING FIRE

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:21.496
EQUIPMENT UP THERE SO OUR OUR

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.198
FIRE TEAMS HAVE TO HAVE.

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.133
SMALL FIRE ENGINES THAT CAN

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.868
MANEUVER THROUGH THE SMALL

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:28.036
STREETS.

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:31.106
AND THE MUTUAL AID.

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:33.008
FIRE TRUCKS A LOT OF ROOM CAN'T

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:34.443
GET UP INTO THOSE AREAS.

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:41.817
SO -- JUST THE CIRCULATION --

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:45.087
EVALUATIONS AND HARM REDUCTION.

01:18:45.153 --> 01:18:47.689
LOOK AT THE CIRCULATION AND HOW

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:48.890
YOU CAN REDUCE.

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:51.059
HARM AND REAL US WITH.

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:52.961
A BETTER.

01:18:53.028 --> 01:18:55.197
CIRCULATION IN THE IN THOSE HIGH

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.032
FIRE HI HI.

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:01.369
RHYS FIRE AREAS SO -- I THINK

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.071
MAYBE THAT THAT COULD BE -- IN

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.506
ADDITION TO THE BILL IT'S NOT

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.776
COMING TO MY COMMITTEE -- I LOOK

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:08.877
AT THIS BILL BECAUSE I'M VERY

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:10.011
CONCERNED ABOUT IT WE HAD A

01:19:10.078 --> 01:19:11.847
PUBLIC MEETING.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:14.683
IN MY AREA IN LOS GATOS WERE.

01:19:14.749 --> 01:19:16.118
WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THAT

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:18.186
THE MEETING WAS LED BY CAL FIRE

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:21.089
AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.124
CHIEFS.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.792
THEY ALL CAME DOWN TO THE

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.727
MEETING AND WE THIS WAS THE

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:27.329
TYPES ISSUES WE DISCUSS WE ALSO

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:31.333
DISCUSS -- COPE COMPLIANCE.

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:33.168
AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:35.804
OF STRUCTURES IN THE HIGH FIRE

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.873
AREA THAT DON'T CONFORM.

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.175
AND LOOKING AT CO COMPLIANCE IN

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:43.145
A MORE SEVERE WAY POSSIBLY.

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:46.148
SO WE CAN -- GO UP DO

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.649
INSPECTIONS SO.

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:50.285
FIND -- HOUSING.

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.187
THE FIRE MARSHALS WERE STRONGLY

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:53.922
RECOMMENDING THIS CALL

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:56.191
COMPLIANCE IS A NOTHER HARM HARM

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:58.393
REDUCTION STRATEGY THAT WE NEED

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.327
TO TO DO.

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.363
I THINK THE BILL COULD ADDRESS

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.165
THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE POSSIBLY.

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:04.900
A LITTLE BETTER CLEARER SO SO

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.735
THOSE ARE MY SUGGESTIONS AS A

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.803

TRANSPORTATION PLANNING STRATEGY

01:20:16.144 --> 01:20:17.679
AND I HOPE THAT -- WE WILL BE

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:20.115
SUCCESSFUL IN WORKING OF SOME OF

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.583
THESE ISSUES OUT.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.785

THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IS NOT

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:11.733
JUST ABOUT BUILDING HOUSING BUT

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.001
IT'S ALSO ABOUT GETTING FOLKS.

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.237
OUT WHEN THERE IS A JAZZ FREE ON

01:21:15.303 --> 01:21:17.239
THEIR DOORSTEP AND THIS BILL

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:18.807
WILL BE A FOCUS IN ON THAT AND

OUR FIRE TEAMS GO UP INTO LAW.

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.687

JUST THE YES I USED TO BE

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.325
INSPECTION I CALLED I CALLED

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.094
SOFT INSPECTIONS YEAH SERVER

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.895
LIKE A COMMUNITY RELATIONS TYPE

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:42.697
INSPECTION WHEN YOU GO AND TALK

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.733

THAT BUT THEN FOLLOWING UP ON

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.079
THAT AFTER.

01:21:58.146 --> 01:22:00.248
WORKING WITH THE HOMEOWNER A

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:03.752
MORE DELIBERATE INSPECTION

01:22:03.818 --> 01:22:05.020
THAT'S MORE FORMAL.

01:22:05.086 --> 01:22:06.621

THOSE VIOLATIONS -- QUITE A BIT.

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:34.182
IN OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK THERE

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:35.717
COULD BE A STRONG FOCUS.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.118
OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.187
TRYING TO DO MAYBE SUPPLEMENTS

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:40.722
THOSE.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:45.393

BILL IS IN PROCESS AND THAT I'M

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:26.094

AND THE REASON THAT WE OPPOSE IT

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:24.497

LEGISLATIVE.

01:59:07.039 --> 01:59:08.708
ACTS THAT IT CONFLICTS WITHIN IT

01:59:08.774 --> 01:59:10.443
ALTERS ONE IS THE REDEVELOPMENT

01:59:49.882 --> 01:59:52.351
THE CURRENT BUDGET FOR ALLOCATES

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:53.986

FIRE DISTRICTS -- IF WE EXTEND

02:00:06.832 --> 02:00:08.834

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- SB ONE

02:00:15.074 --> 02:00:15.808
EIGHTY NINE REALLY CONFLICTS

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:16.876

BUT THE THIRD REASON HAD IT

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:24.383

WATER SYSTEMATICALLY.

02:26:04.922 --> 02:26:07.959
RELIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE SEVEN

02:26:08.025 --> 02:26:09.026
HUNDRED BILLION MOST OF THIS

02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:10.728
WILL COME IN THE FORM OF OF

LOANS AND BONDS.

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:15.700
AND THE HOPE IS THAT WHEN WE GO

02:26:15.766 --> 02:26:17.068
OUT TO THESE INSTITUTIONS THAT

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:18.469
THE MARKET WILL.

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:19.837
PROVIDE US LOW INTEREST RATE

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:20.872
LOANS.

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:22.540
BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE CAN CONTROL

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:24.542
THAT IF WE DECIDE WE HAD THE

02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:26.444
DESIRE.

02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:29.080
BUT I WAS HERE -- NOT I WASN'T

02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:33.818
HERE WHEN I WHEN THE THE I WAS I

02:26:33.885 --> 02:26:35.219
CAME TO LEGISLATURE WHEN THE

02:26:35.286 --> 02:26:36.320
CONSTRUCTION OF THE OAKLAND A

02:26:36.387 --> 02:26:37.421
BIT BRIDGE.

02:26:37.488 --> 02:26:38.923
COMMENCED.

02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:40.391
AND BACK THEN THERE WAS AN

02:26:40.458 --> 02:26:43.594
AGREEMENT AT TO ART BECAUSE THEY

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:45.229
COULDN'T FIND.

02:26:45.296 --> 02:26:46.597
BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S INTEREST

02:26:46.664 --> 02:26:47.965
RATES AT THE TIME THE CREDIT

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:50.334
RATING THEY COULDN'T FIND.

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:51.969
A CAPITAL TO BUILD UP THE BRIDGE

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:54.305
IT WAS -- A NINE BILLION DOLLAR

02:26:54.372 --> 02:26:55.873
BRIDGE AT THE TIME.

02:26:55.940 --> 02:26:58.009
AND AND WHERE DID WE GO FOR THE

02:26:58.075 --> 02:26:59.343
REST OF FOR THE LOAN FOR THAT

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:01.279
MONEY WE WENT TO CHINA AND CHINA

02:27:01.345 --> 02:27:02.980
GAVE US LOWER INTEREST WITH THE

02:27:03.047 --> 02:27:04.715
CONDITION THAT THE MAJORITY OF

02:27:04.782 --> 02:27:06.717
THAT BRIDGE BE BUILT IN CHINA.

02:27:06.784 --> 02:27:08.452
SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT.

02:27:08.519 --> 02:27:10.254
THE COST OF CONSTRUCTING THAT

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:11.789
BRIDGE AND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:13.157
MEANT IT WOULD HAVE MEANT TO

02:27:13.224 --> 02:27:15.226
LOCAL WORKERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:27:15.293 --> 02:27:16.794
TO BUILD THAT BRIDGE BY LOCAL --

02:27:16.861 --> 02:27:18.529
CONTRACTORS HERE CALIFORNIA AND

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:20.731
TO SPEND OUR MONEY LOCALLY IN

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:22.099
OUR ECONOMY WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE

02:27:22.166 --> 02:27:23.968
DONE NINE BILLION DOLLAR

02:27:24.035 --> 02:27:25.970
INVESTMENT IN OUR OWN STATE.

02:27:26.037 --> 02:27:27.305
AND THAT WAS LOST [inaudible]

02:27:27.371 --> 02:27:29.106
THAT BRIDGE.

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:32.176
WAS COMPLETED IN.

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:32.777
TWENTY THIRTEEN FOR I'M SORRY

02:27:32.843 --> 02:27:34.312
THAT DIDN'T THE NUMBER SIX POINT

02:27:34.378 --> 02:27:35.746
FOUR BILLION.

02:27:35.813 --> 02:27:36.981
BUT SIX POINT FOUR BILLION IS

02:27:37.048 --> 02:27:39.450
STILL.

02:27:39.517 --> 02:27:42.153
ON EARTH LOAD OF MONEY.

02:27:42.220 --> 02:27:44.355
AND END OF END WELL THERE WERE

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:46.424
SOME LOCAL JOBS WITH WITH WITH

02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:47.491
WITH THAT CONSTRUCTION THERE

02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:49.360
COULD HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY

02:27:49.427 --> 02:27:50.261
MORE.

02:27:50.328 --> 02:27:51.929
AND THOSE INTEREST RATES COULD

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:54.365
HAVE STAYED HERE IN OUR LOCAL

02:27:54.432 --> 02:27:56.133
BANKS IN FACT IF WE HAD A STATE

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:58.002
BANK THAT MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:27:58.069 --> 02:27:59.036
DEPOSITED.

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:01.606
IN OUR OWN STATE'S BUDGET.

02:28:01.672 --> 02:28:05.376
AND USED TO CUT UP A PROVIDE

02:28:05.443 --> 02:28:06.510
OTHER LOANS TOWARD

02:28:06.577 --> 02:28:08.012
MUNICIPALITIES SO IN ESSENCE

02:28:08.079 --> 02:28:09.580
WHAT IS MY BILL DO MY BILL

02:28:09.647 --> 02:28:12.149
ALLOWS FOR US TO CHARTER BANK

02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:14.318
DEPOSIT OUR STATE FUNDS.

02:28:14.385 --> 02:28:16.887
INTO THAT BANK AND ISSUE LOANS

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:19.156
TO MUNICIPALITIES -- IF YOU JUST

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:21.058
CONSIDERED IT IF WE JUST

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:23.561
DEPOSITED OUR RESERVES WHAT OUR

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:25.830
RESERVES TO IN RIGHT NOW THEY'RE

02:28:25.896 --> 02:28:27.198
SITTING IN AN ACCOUNT.

02:28:27.265 --> 02:28:28.733
NON PERFORMING.

02:28:28.799 --> 02:28:30.167
RIGHT NOW THE INTEREST RATE I

02:28:30.234 --> 02:28:31.636
THINK THAT WERE RECEIVING AS

02:28:31.702 --> 02:28:33.938
LESS THAN 1%.

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:35.273
THIS IS NOTHING WORRY WERE

02:28:35.339 --> 02:28:38.075
BASICALLY PAIN -- WE'RE GETTING
--

02:28:38.142 --> 02:28:40.077
ALMOST NOTHING ON OUR MONEY.

02:28:40.144 --> 02:28:42.113
BUT IT JUST LIST LIST THINK

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:43.848
FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

02:28:43.914 --> 02:28:45.883
DEPOSITED INTO AYE AYE BANK.

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:46.984
WOULD MAKE FOURTEEN BILLION

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:49.587
IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO LOCAL

02:28:49.654 --> 02:28:52.456
MUNICIPALITIES FOR LET'S SAY.

02:28:52.523 --> 02:28:54.659
WHAT IF WE WANTED TO CHARGE 1%

02:28:54.725 --> 02:28:56.360
OR ONE POINT 5%?

02:28:56.427 --> 02:28:57.828
AT ONE POINT 5% WERE LOOKING A

02:28:57.895 --> 02:29:00.398
BIT AT A BILLION DOLLARS OVER

02:29:00.464 --> 02:29:02.566
FIVE YEARS THAT WE WOULD
DEPOSIT.

02:29:02.633 --> 02:29:03.701
INTO OUR AYE BANK.

02:29:03.768 --> 02:29:05.436
BUT THAT WOULD ALSO SAVE THOSE

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:07.104
INSTITUTIONS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:11.108
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INTEREST RATES

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:13.044
GO UP.

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.245
WHEN THEY GO UP?

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:14.879
AND AND AND SOME OF THESE LOCAL

02:29:14.945 --> 02:29:15.513
GOVERNMENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE

02:29:15.579 --> 02:29:18.316
BEST CREDIT RATINGS COULD BE

02:29:18.382 --> 02:29:21.552
PAIN. FIVE SIX SEVEN MAYBE MORE

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.421
PERCENT ON BONDS WE COULD GIVE

02:29:23.487 --> 02:29:26.557
THEM MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE
RATES.

02:29:26.624 --> 02:29:28.759
AND STILL MAKE A RETURN AND

02:29:28.826 --> 02:29:32.096
WE'RE BANKING WITH INSTITUTIONS

02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:33.831
THAT [inaudible]

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:35.232
CAN'T FAIL.

02:29:35.299 --> 02:29:36.901
SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT RISKY

02:29:36.967 --> 02:29:39.337
LOANS -- WILL YES.

02:29:39.403 --> 02:29:41.405
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IT'S NOT OFTEN

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:42.573
THAT THEY GOING TO BACKROOM C.

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:45.176
BUT WHEN THEY DO -- BANKRUPTCY

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:46.644
JUST MEANS REORGANIZATIONS FOR

02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:48.279
CITIES IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY

02:29:48.346 --> 02:29:49.080
GO OUT OF BUSINESS I'VE NEVER

02:29:49.146 --> 02:29:49.747
SEEN.

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:51.248
A GOVERNMENT AGENCY GO OUT OF

02:29:51.315 --> 02:29:53.150
BUSINESS IT'S VERY RARE BUT EVEN

02:29:53.217 --> 02:29:54.852
IN THAT OF THEN WE WOULD BE

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:57.188
CVERED -- BECAUSE OUR

02:29:57.254 --> 02:29:58.756
INVESTMENTS WOULD BE VERY HIGH

02:29:58.823 --> 02:30:00.424
THERE BE ERY LOW RISK AND

02:30:00.491 --> 02:30:01.726
RETURN RATE WILL COVER FOR THAT

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:04.095
BUT I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU THINK

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:05.830
THAT THAT.

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.832
THE RISK -- BY APPRECIATE THAT

02:30:07.898 --> 02:30:09.300
BUT IT REALLY ISN'T BECAUSE WERE

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:11.869
REALLY OF BUT YOU KNOW IN THE

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:14.271
ACT WHEN WHEN WE WE MAKE TO HAVE

02:30:14.338 --> 02:30:15.506
MADE IT HARDER FOR LOCAL

02:30:15.573 --> 02:30:17.308
GOVERNMENTS RAISE CAPITAL THAN

02:30:17.375 --> 02:30:18.876
EVER BEFORE IN OUR HISTORY.

02:30:18.943 --> 02:30:20.244
WE'VE ELIMINATED --

02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:22.046
REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE'VE

02:30:22.113 --> 02:30:23.981
ELIMINATED A LOT OF A LOT OF

02:30:24.048 --> 02:30:25.683
GRANT PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY TO

02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:27.685
FEDERAL LEVEL WERE NOT SEEN A

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:28.352
LITTLE FURTHER.

02:30:28.419 --> 02:30:29.453
A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS GO TO OUR

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:30.588
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

02:30:30.654 --> 02:30:33.657
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO

02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:34.425
FOR THEM AND UP ANDUP AND UP

02:30:34.492 --> 02:30:36.093
ALLOWING THEM TO GET VERY LOW

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:37.661
INTEREST RATE LOANS.

02:30:37.728 --> 02:30:39.363
AND USING MONEY THAT WE ALREADY

02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:45.069
HAVE THAT'S ON DEPOSIT.

02:30:45.136 --> 02:30:45.836
BUT IMAGINE IF WE JUST TO BE A

02:30:45.903 --> 02:30:47.138
POSITIVE FOURTEEN BILLION WE

02:30:47.204 --> 02:30:47.705
WOULD HAVE FOURTEEN BILLION

02:30:47.772 --> 02:30:49.607
IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND

02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:51.742
LEVERAGE BOWL -- WE WOULD BE

02:30:51.809 --> 02:30:53.144
ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY TO

02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:54.178
LEVERAGE TOLD THE FEDERAL

02:30:54.245 --> 02:30:56.013
RESERVE WHICH ALLOWS TOMORROW I

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:58.015
DON'T SUGGEST THAT WE BORROW.

02:30:58.082 --> 02:30:58.783
BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T NEED TO

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:01.018
BORROW -- IF THERE WAS AN

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:02.520
EMERGENCY THOUGH HOWEVER OUR

02:31:02.586 --> 02:31:03.954
BANK WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BORROW

02:31:04.021 --> 02:31:05.990
FROM THE RESERVE WHICH IS A VERY

02:31:06.056 --> 02:31:08.159
NORMAL PRACTICE FOR EVERY SINGLE

02:31:08.225 --> 02:31:09.693
BANK IN THIS NATION.

02:31:09.760 --> 02:31:11.495
BUT I'M SAYING WE'RE BIG ENOUGH

02:31:11.562 --> 02:31:13.130
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH OUR

02:31:13.197 --> 02:31:14.765
WHAT I MEAN TODAY LOOKING AT OUR

02:31:14.832 --> 02:31:16.233
OUR BUDGET THAT WERE PUT WE'RE

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:18.436
LOOKING AT A HUNDRED AND NINETY

02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:20.371
BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET IF WE

02:31:20.438 --> 02:31:22.072
DEPOSIT THAT AND TO OUR STATE.

02:31:22.139 --> 02:31:25.776
OWNED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.

02:31:25.843 --> 02:31:27.545
THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT

02:31:27.611 --> 02:31:29.046
WE WOULD SAVE US A STATE.

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:30.514
AND IF WE LOANED A PORTION OF IT

02:31:30.581 --> 02:31:32.516
THINK ABOUT ALL THE MONEY THAT

02:31:32.583 --> 02:31:33.117
WE COULD RETURN TOWARD GENERAL

02:31:33.184 --> 02:31:34.819
FUND.

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:36.654
I HAVE USED IN A ON A NORMAL

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:39.256
SICK ON MANY OCCASIONS THE THE

02:31:39.323 --> 02:31:41.659
NORTH DAKOTA BANK THEY HAVE

02:31:41.725 --> 02:31:44.462
ARGUED WELL IF YOU ARE OPEN TO

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:45.663
STATE BANK BANKS WILL CLOSE.

02:31:45.729 --> 02:31:48.966
IN NORTH DAKOTA STATE WAS SEVEN

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:49.733
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE

02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:51.969
THEY HAVE THE LARGEST PER CAPITA

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:52.169
BANK.

02:31:52.236 --> 02:31:58.509
OF RATIO IN THE COUNTRY IN

02:31:58.576 --> 02:32:00.744
ADDITION TO THAT -- THE INDOOR

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:03.547
DAKOTA BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY FELT

02:32:03.614 --> 02:32:04.281
WELL.

02:32:04.348 --> 02:32:08.018
WE'RE NOT GONNA WE DON'T WANT --

02:32:08.085 --> 02:32:09.587
TO A GAUGE IN BANKING ACTIVITY

02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:11.388
BUT WE WILL ALLOW DEPOSITS TO BE

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:12.990
USED AND THEY THEY WORK THROUGH

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:15.993
THEIR LOCAL BANKS TO TO GIVE

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:17.728
LOANS TO THE COMMUNITY.

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:18.896
AND THEY WORK TO LOCAL BANKS.

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:20.431
AND SO THEY HAVE ALMOST NO

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:23.033
EXPENSES ALL THEY DO IS DEPOSIT.

02:32:23.100 --> 02:32:25.236
THERE THERE ARE -- THE MONEY IN

02:32:25.302 --> 02:32:26.570
THE BANK THEY USE IT FOR THEIR

02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:28.906
OWN PURPOSES AND AND AND TWENTY

02:32:28.973 --> 02:32:31.442
YEARS WITH THE STATE OF SEVEN

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:32.109
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THEY HAVE

02:32:32.176 --> 02:32:33.544
RETURNED A BILLION DOLLARS OF

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:35.045
PROFIT.

02:32:35.112 --> 02:32:38.182
TO THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR STATE

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:45.322
A BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS

02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:46.657
WHAT ENGAGE IN AND NO ACTIVITY

02:32:46.724 --> 02:32:47.825
AT ALL JUST.

02:32:47.892 --> 02:32:49.093
USING MONEY TO TO GET -- TO GIVE

02:32:49.159 --> 02:32:49.960
IT LOW INTEREST RATES TO BANKS

02:32:50.027 --> 02:32:50.561
IN THEIR COMMUNITY WHICH IS A

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:52.062
HUGE SERVICE FOR THE BANKS IN

02:32:52.129 --> 02:32:54.198
THEIR COMMUNITY BECAUSE THE

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:55.199
BANKS IN THE COMMUNITY COULD
GET.

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:57.735
VERY LOW INTEREST RATE MONEY

02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:59.770
THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE PAY

02:32:59.837 --> 02:33:00.404
FOR FOR MORE FOR ON THE FEDERAL

02:33:00.471 --> 02:33:01.472
RESERVE.

02:33:01.539 --> 02:33:04.408

02:33:08.779 --> 02:33:09.813
THIS BILL.

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:11.282
BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD BE SO

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:12.750

THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

02:33:17.388 --> 02:33:18.989
GONNA BE EMBARKING IN LARGE

02:33:19.056 --> 02:33:27.464
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE

02:33:27.531 --> 02:33:28.265
GOING TO GO TO BOND MARKETS.

WHY DON'T WE LOOK AT THIS AS AN

02:33:33.904 --> 02:33:35.639
OPTION THIS WILL SAVE OUR LOCAL

02:33:35.706 --> 02:33:36.140

I HAVE LOTS TO SAY THIS ALL ARE

02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:09.139
CUT MY COMMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:11.875
A LOT OF GREAT WITNESSES ON THIS

02:34:11.942 --> 02:34:14.044
AND I JUST WANNA.

02:34:14.111 --> 02:34:16.280
US STATE.

02:34:16.347 --> 02:34:16.981
YOU KNOW.

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:18.082
THE OPPOSITION IS STATED THE

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:20.050
EXPANSION.

02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:22.820
OF THE AYE BANK. TO TWO OF THAT

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:24.054
WOULD BE VERY COSTLY.

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:27.024
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU THAT IT'S

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:28.325
COSTLY IN AND THAT'S ITS ONLY

02:34:28.392 --> 02:34:30.894
COSTLY WHEN YOU MAKE A TRANSFER

02:34:30.961 --> 02:34:31.195
[inaudible]

02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:33.931
OF MONEY. ONE ACCOUNT TO THE

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:35.566
OTHER SIDE HOW MUCH THAT COSTS

02:34:35.633 --> 02:34:37.768
NOTHING BUT IF YOU LIST.

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:39.269
FOURTEEN BILLION AS OUR DEPOSIT

02:34:39.336 --> 02:34:39.903
THEY'RE GONNA LIST WITH LOTS OF

02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:40.838
COST.

02:34:40.904 --> 02:34:43.007
BECAUSE IN ESSENCE THERE ARE WE

02:34:43.073 --> 02:34:44.008
ALREADY HAVE AN AYE BANK THAT'S

02:34:44.074 --> 02:34:45.275
OPERATING.

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:46.276
THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

02:34:46.343 --> 02:34:48.145
ISSUING LOANS THAT HAS THE

02:34:48.212 --> 02:34:49.413
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS

02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.782
EVERYTHING THEY NEED ALREADY IN

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.018
PLACE ALL WE NEED TO DO IS

02:34:54.084 --> 02:34:55.586
DEPOSIT SOME MONEY IN THERE.

02:34:55.653 --> 02:34:58.722
FROM THE MINUTE WE DEPOSIT THE

02:34:58.789 --> 02:34:59.657
MONEY INTO THE AYE BANK WELL.

02:34:59.723 --> 02:35:01.325
THERE ARE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE

02:35:01.392 --> 02:35:03.761
COSTS OF ESTABLISHING THE BANK

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:04.461
AND THAT.

02:35:04.528 --> 02:35:06.230
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE ABSORBED

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:08.699
IN THE FIRST YEAR OF REVENUES.

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:10.401
BECAUSE WOULD MAKE ENOUGH MONEY

02:35:10.467 --> 02:35:11.635
IN THE FIRST YEAR TO PAY FOR

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:13.203
THAT AND IT'S WORTH.

02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:15.472
GIVING THE AYE BANK ALONE.

02:35:15.539 --> 02:35:16.740
FIRST TO FUND START UP COSTS

02:35:16.807 --> 02:35:18.475
THAT WILL RECOVER IN THE FIRST

02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:21.111
YEAR.

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:22.413
OF ISSUE IN LOANS.

02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:23.580
BUT IF WE EVEN WANTED TO USE

02:35:23.647 --> 02:35:27.251
JUST -- I MEAN MODELED AFTER THE

02:35:27.317 --> 02:35:29.119
NORTH DAKOTA BANK.

02:35:29.186 --> 02:35:30.320
WE WOULD HAVE.

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:33.791
OF AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF OF

02:35:33.857 --> 02:35:35.492
DISCRETION TO TARGET MONEY INTO

02:35:35.559 --> 02:35:38.829
OUR CITIES AT VERY LOW INTEREST

02:35:38.896 --> 02:35:42.833
RATES AND THAT IS THE ALSO --

02:35:42.900 --> 02:35:45.803
THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE LOCAL

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:48.272
MUNICIPALITIES TO DEPOSIT IN THE

02:35:48.338 --> 02:35:50.107
STATE BANK THAT THAT COULDN'T IF

02:35:50.174 --> 02:35:51.442
THEY HAVE A GREAT WORKING

02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:53.844
RELATIONSHIP THE LOCAL BANK THEY

02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:55.179
CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT -- IT

02:35:55.245 --> 02:35:58.182
DOES NOT SEEK TO PROVIDE.

02:35:58.248 --> 02:36:02.453
ADDITIONAL FINANCING OPTIONS --

02:36:02.519 --> 02:36:04.688
THIS BILL SEEKS TO PROVIDE

02:36:04.755 --> 02:36:06.590
ADDITIONAL FINANCING OFF OPTIONS

02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:08.192
FOR MUNICIPALITIES AND THEY

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:10.627
DON'T HAVE TO DEPOSIT WHAT THE

02:36:10.694 --> 02:36:11.595
STATE.

02:36:11.662 --> 02:36:13.163
TO OBTAIN THOSE IT'LL BE BASED

02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:15.065
ON THE AVAILABILITY OF MONEY SO

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:16.233
IT COULD BE A WIN WIN.

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:18.068
THEY CHOOSE NOT TO DEPOSIT THEY

02:36:18.135 --> 02:36:18.869
CAN STILL HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

02:36:18.936 --> 02:36:20.838
WITH OUR AYE BANK IF THEY CHOOSE

02:36:20.904 --> 02:36:21.472
TO DO SO.

02:36:21.538 --> 02:36:23.474
THEY CAN -- YOU HAVE THEIR MONEY

THAT APPEARS TO BE THE MOST

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:32.176
PROMISING AT THE MOMENT IS THIS.

02:37:32.242 --> 02:37:33.510
ONE IT WOULD SIMPLY TRANSFORM

02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:35.112
THE EXISTING AYE BANK INTO A

02:37:35.179 --> 02:37:36.880

CALIFORNIA MAKING ASSERTION

02:37:57.568 --> 02:37:59.002
VISION A DEPOSITARY AYE BANK

02:37:59.069 --> 02:38:00.370
WOULD NOT COMPETE WITH LOCAL

02:38:00.437 --> 02:38:01.872
CALIFORNIA BANKS OR TAKE

02:38:01.939 --> 02:38:03.674
DEPOSITS AWAY FROM THE LOCAL

02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:05.209

DEPOSITS IN LOCAL BANKS IN THIS

02:38:08.912 --> 02:38:10.714
CASE THE AYE BANKS COMPETITORS

02:38:10.781 --> 02:38:12.649
WOULD BE WEALTHY BOND HOLDERS

02:38:12.716 --> 02:38:13.984
WHO FIND INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS

02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:16.520

ONE OR TWO POINT 4%.

02:38:30.634 --> 02:38:32.469
INTEREST ON THEIR RESERVES AT

02:38:32.536 --> 02:38:34.438

02:38:40.477 --> 02:38:42.946
AND THEY'RE PAYING OUR ON OUR

02:38:43.013 --> 02:38:44.414
PUBLIC DEPOSITS ALMOST NOTHING.

02:38:44.481 --> 02:38:45.949
FINANCING IS HALF THE COST OF

02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:47.551
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE AYE BANK

02:38:47.618 --> 02:38:53.590
CAN REDUCE THEIR COSTS BY 50%.

02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:54.925
LEE HAS ONLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

02:38:54.992 --> 02:38:55.626
MILLION TO LAND.

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:56.226
OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

02:38:56.293 --> 02:38:56.860
WERE USED INSTEAD TO CAPITALIZE

02:38:56.927 --> 02:38:58.629
A BANK AND A 10% CAPITAL

02:38:58.695 --> 02:39:00.564
REQUIREMENT IT COULD LAND FOR

02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:01.999
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:39:02.065 --> 02:39:03.166
IT WOULD EVENTUALLY NEED

02:39:03.233 --> 02:39:04.801
DEPOSITS OF A FEW BILLION THIS

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:06.370

MARKET LOANS WOULD ATTRACT THE

02:39:15.412 --> 02:39:16.280
NECESSARY DEPOSIT.

02:39:16.346 --> 02:39:17.781

DEPOSITED AND THEN LOAN IT OUT
--

02:40:58.015 --> 02:40:59.182

PARTICULAR IS ONE THAT I THINK

02:41:47.831 --> 02:41:49.332
IS A BIT ROM THE INDUSTRY

02:41:49.399 --> 02:41:50.634
PERSPECTIVE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:52.302
HEAD SCRATCHER WE'RE NOT QUITE

02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:54.871

DEPOSITORS AN INTEREST RATE THAT

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:09.686
IS HIGHER THAN COMMERCIAL BANKS

02:42:09.753 --> 02:42:11.021
WOULD PROVIDE WHILE

02:42:11.088 --> 02:42:12.155
SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKING

INFRASTRUCTURE LOANS AT A RATE

02:42:14.324 --> 02:42:16.827
THAT IS LOWER THAN A COMMERCIAL

02:42:16.893 --> 02:42:17.727
BANK WOULD PROVIDE.

02:42:17.794 --> 02:42:18.662
ALL THE WHILE MAINTAINING

I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE

02:42:31.541 --> 02:42:34.344
INSTITUTION -- IT IN CALIFORNIA

02:42:34.411 --> 02:42:35.545

02:42:35.612 --> 02:42:37.380
PENCIL OUT -- WITHOUT MASSIVE

02:42:37.447 --> 02:42:40.217
LOSSES -- IT THE INTERESTING

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:41.518
THING IS THAT THE PROPONENTS

02:42:41.585 --> 02:42:42.719
TIME AND TIME AGAIN THEY BRING

02:42:42.786 --> 02:42:44.788

02:42:57.234 --> 02:42:58.702
WHAT THE PROPONENTS DIDN'T TELL

02:42:58.768 --> 02:43:00.670

USED THE I BAG JUST TO DEPOSIT

02:52:03.346 --> 02:52:04.681
ITS OWN.

02:52:04.747 --> 02:52:06.416
BUDGET THINK ABOUT.

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:08.685
HOW MUCH MONEY WE WOULD SAVE IN?

02:52:08.751 --> 02:52:11.254

FIVE BILLION DOLLAR MEDICAL.

02:52:12.822 --> 02:52:15.124
PROGRAM WE HAVE WE COULD USE OUR

ALLY BANK TO LEVERAGE LOAN TO

02:52:16.959 --> 02:52:19.128
DRAW REVENUE AND THAT REVENUE

02:52:19.195 --> 02:52:20.563
COULD FIND ANYTHING THAT WE
WANT.

02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:22.799
INCLUDING BALANCING OUR BUDGET

02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:24.500
OR JUST KEEP IT IN THE BANK AND

02:52:24.567 --> 02:52:25.668
USE THAT.

02:52:25.735 --> 02:52:27.203
TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LOANS FOR

02:52:27.270 --> 02:52:28.337
OUR COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF

02:52:28.404 --> 02:52:32.909
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND WE

02:52:32.975 --> 02:52:34.744

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:35.745
LOANS I MEAN THERE'S I JUST SEE

02:52:35.812 --> 02:52:36.879
SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

02:52:36.946 --> 02:52:38.881
BUT IF IF THE IT'S IT'S IT'S UP

02:52:38.948 --> 02:52:39.882

02:52:48.591 --> 02:52:50.760
SOMETHING IT WOULD BE FOOLISH OF

02:52:50.827 --> 02:52:52.228
NOT OF US NOT TO TRY.

02:52:52.295 --> 02:52:55.131
AND THE COSTS ARE SO MINIMAL.

02:52:55.198 --> 02:52:57.200
THE COSTS ARE SO MINIMAL THEY

02:52:57.266 --> 02:53:00.036
CAN EASILY BE -- PAID AND
REPAID.

02:53:00.103 --> 02:53:01.270
AND THEN.

02:53:01.337 --> 02:53:02.839
I WE COULD HAVE REVENUE OFFSET

02:53:02.905 --> 02:53:04.107
THOSE COSTS.

02:53:04.173 --> 02:53:06.109

02:55:24.981 --> 02:55:27.617
MONEY AND WAVE I DON'T KNOW

02:55:27.683 --> 02:55:28.684
WHERE ARE.

02:55:28.751 --> 02:55:29.285
STATE TREASURER IS OUR STATE

02:55:29.352 --> 02:55:30.786
CONTROLLER BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO

02:55:30.853 --> 02:55:32.488
MONITOR THE CASH FLOW OF THE

02:55:32.555 --> 02:55:35.091
STATE -- BUT I I I HAD TO PUT

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:36.759
TOGETHER A BUSINESS PLAN AND I I

02:55:36.826 --> 02:55:39.061
DON'T SEE THAT HERE AS WELL ON

02:55:39.128 --> 02:55:41.197
WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THAT WAS

02:55:41.264 --> 02:55:43.199
AN INTERESTING EXERCISE ASWELL
--

02:55:43.266 --> 02:55:45.034
AND ACTUALLY GET GREAT FEEDBACK

02:55:45.101 --> 02:55:46.535
I SHOWED IT.

02:55:46.602 --> 02:55:48.271
TO TWENTY SMALL BANK CEOS IN THE

02:55:48.337 --> 02:55:49.238
RESPONSE I GOT WAS THAT ONLY

02:55:49.305 --> 02:55:50.406
LIKE THAT THEY WANT TO BE ON MY

02:55:50.473 --> 02:55:51.674
BOARD WHICH IS.

02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:53.809
KIND OF FUNNY FOR GOVERNMENT.

02:55:53.876 --> 02:55:57.346
BUT THE GOVERNMENT GETTING INTO

02:55:57.413 --> 02:55:59.382
THIS ARENA IS IS RATHER DICEY

02:55:59.448 --> 02:56:01.417
IT'S RATHER INTERESTING YOU'VE

02:56:01.484 --> 02:56:02.952
YOU MENTIONED BANKRUPTCY A FEW

02:56:03.019 --> 02:56:04.553
TIMES I'VE BEEN THERE.

02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:05.121
TOO YOU KNOW THE COUNTY OF

02:56:05.187 --> 02:56:06.555
ORANGE DID FILE FOR CHAPTER NINE

02:56:06.622 --> 02:56:08.090
BANKRUPTCY GUESTS WERE STILL IN

02:56:08.157 --> 02:56:09.392
BUSINESS.

02:56:09.458 --> 02:56:11.327
BUT WE WERE GENERATING REALLY

02:56:11.394 --> 02:56:13.996
NICE RETURNS FOR DEPOSITORS AND

02:56:14.063 --> 02:56:14.897
THEN AFTER THE COUNTY WOULD

02:56:14.964 --> 02:56:16.899
BANKRUPT AND REALIZE THAT THEIR

02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:18.534
FUNDS WERE PUT ON HOLD.

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:20.069
YOU KNOW OPENING A BANKRUPTCY

02:56:20.136 --> 02:56:21.203
JUDGE RELEASING THOSE FRIENDS

02:56:21.270 --> 02:56:22.338
THAT.

02:56:22.405 --> 02:56:24.540
THAT WAS A KILLER THAT ONCE THE

02:56:24.607 --> 02:56:26.242
FUNDS COULD BE FREED THEY WERE

02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:28.110
THEY LEFT AND RIGHT HARDLY ANY

02:56:28.177 --> 02:56:29.045
CAME BACK.

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:31.080
AND SO IT JUST GOT REALLY

02:56:31.147 --> 02:56:33.149
AWKWARD SO EVEN THE FEAR OF OF

02:56:33.215 --> 02:56:34.483
OF OF HAVING.

02:56:34.550 --> 02:56:36.285
A LOSS OF CONTROL WOULD BE.

02:56:36.352 --> 02:56:38.154
REAL ARE GREAT THAT'S WERE MAYBE

02:56:38.220 --> 02:56:39.989
A BUSINESS PLAN WOULD BE HELPFUL

02:56:40.056 --> 02:56:41.157
WITH SOME OF THESE.

02:56:41.223 --> 02:56:43.292

CALL US WHETHER WE START THE

02:58:22.792 --> 02:58:25.027
PROGRAM IS IS CONTINGENT ON ON

02:58:25.094 --> 02:58:26.629

APPROVALS CAN WE DO IT

02:58:27.163 --> 02:58:28.431
ABSOLUTELY.

02:58:28.497 --> 02:58:31.000
WE HAVE THE SKILL AND EXPERIENCE

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:32.168
ABSOLUTELY.

02:58:32.234 --> 02:58:33.569
THE THE THAT IS NOT WHERE MY

02:58:33.636 --> 02:58:35.838
CONCERN LINES MY MY CONCERN IS

02:58:35.905 --> 02:58:39.275
TO WHAT DEGREE DO WE MOVE

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:41.444
FORWARD WITH THIS AND AND IT'S

02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:43.879
IT'S NOT REALLY.

02:58:43.946 --> 02:58:45.548
MUCH OF A CONCERN I MEAN.

02:58:45.614 --> 02:58:47.850
I DON'T I DON'T THINK THERE ARE

02:58:47.917 --> 02:58:50.219
GOING TO BE A E. WILL BANKS LOSE

02:58:50.286 --> 02:58:52.088
DEPOSITS ABSOLUTELY.

02:58:52.154 --> 02:58:52.788
BUT THEY'LL BE THEY'LL LOSE

02:58:52.855 --> 02:58:54.857
DEPOSITS ONLY WHEN THEY'RE NOT

02:58:54.924 --> 02:58:56.192
BEING COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER

02:58:56.258 --> 02:58:57.426
LOCAL CITIES.

02:58:57.493 --> 02:58:58.961
AND IF THEY'RE NOT OFFERING GOOD

02:58:59.028 --> 02:59:00.729
SERVICES THERE.

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:02.031
LET'S GIVE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:59:02.098 --> 02:59:03.866
ANOTHER OPTION TO COME TO THE

02:59:03.933 --> 02:59:05.801
STATE WORK WITH US.

02:59:05.868 --> 02:59:07.803
AND IF AND IF THEY WORK WITH US

02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:09.605
AND GET BETTER RATES.

02:59:09.672 --> 02:59:11.640
BUT I I THINK THAT'S WHAT BANKS

02:59:11.707 --> 02:59:13.075
ARE MOSTLY AFRAID.

02:59:13.142 --> 02:59:14.610
AFRAID OF COMPETITION.

02:59:14.677 --> 02:59:16.545
AND EN I AGREE WE SHOULD FOLLOW

02:59:16.612 --> 02:59:22.351
EVERY RULE AND CROSS EVERY.

02:59:22.418 --> 02:59:24.220
WE LOOK AT EVERY DETAIL AND AND

02:59:24.286 --> 02:59:25.788
I THINK WITH THERE SHOULD BE A

02:59:25.855 --> 02:59:26.956
LEVEL PLAYING GROUND.

02:59:27.022 --> 02:59:28.991
BUT ALSO WHAT WHY DON'T EVERY

02:59:29.058 --> 02:59:31.227
TIME I MEAN THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF

02:59:31.293 --> 02:59:32.194
GOVERNMENT IS.

02:59:32.261 --> 02:59:34.230
TO IS TO POOL OUR RESOURCES AND

02:59:34.296 --> 02:59:36.398
GIVE THE PEOPLE.

02:59:36.465 --> 02:59:37.900
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:59:37.967 --> 02:59:40.169
A BETTER RETURN ON THEIR MONEY

02:59:40.236 --> 02:59:41.804
ON THEIR TAXES ON THEIR FEES.

02:59:41.871 --> 02:59:43.038
AND WHY HAVEN'T WE USE BANKING

02:59:43.105 --> 02:59:44.740
TO DO THAT.

02:59:44.807 --> 02:59:45.774
AND THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION

02:59:45.841 --> 02:59:47.610
THAT NOBODY CAN ANSWER BECAUSE

02:59:47.676 --> 02:59:50.246
THEY ALWAYS EQUATE IT WITH RISK.

02:59:50.312 --> 02:59:52.615
YEAH OUT EVERYTHING HAS A RISK

02:59:52.681 --> 02:59:54.450
CREATING OF GOVERNMENT HAS A

02:59:54.517 --> 02:59:57.253
RISK PROVIDING SERVICES HAS A

02:59:57.319 --> 02:59:58.053
RISK.

02:59:58.120 --> 03:00:00.189
BUT TEST FIT HERE AND SAY THAT

03:00:00.256 --> 03:00:02.324
IT WOULD BE A RISK TO DEPOSIT

03:00:02.391 --> 03:00:03.726
TAXPAYER FUNDS.

03:00:03.792 --> 03:00:05.828
INTO A STATE BANK BUT IT'S NOT A

03:00:05.895 --> 03:00:09.165
WRIST TO DEPOSITED INTO.

03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:12.601
A PRIVATE BANK THAT'S NOT A
RISK.

03:00:12.668 --> 03:00:14.803
END WHEN THE SAME BANKING

03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:16.672
INSTITUTIONS SAYS NOT A RISK IS

03:00:16.739 --> 03:00:18.174

03:23:29.997 --> 03:23:31.399
LITTLE DETAIL ON THOSE LATER BUT

03:23:31.465 --> 03:23:32.800
LET ME JUST SAY WHAT IS THE

03:23:32.867 --> 03:23:34.335
PURPOSE OF MY BILL.

03:23:34.402 --> 03:23:37.305
SB THREE THIRTY RECOGNIZES THAT

03:23:37.371 --> 03:23:40.441
CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING

03:23:40.508 --> 03:23:42.410
CRISIS.

03:23:42.476 --> 03:23:44.478
WHY ARE WE IN A CRISIS OR

03:23:44.545 --> 03:23:45.746
WHATEVER THE INDICATORS THAT

03:23:45.813 --> 03:23:47.682
DEMONSTRATE TO US THAT WE ARE IN

03:23:47.748 --> 03:23:50.718
THIS CRISIS WE ARE THE?

03:23:50.785 --> 03:23:51.285
FORTY NINE OUT OF OUR FIFTY

03:23:51.352 --> 03:23:53.821
STATES IN NUMBER OF HOUSING

03:23:53.888 --> 03:23:57.725
UNITS PER CAPITA.

03:23:57.792 --> 03:23:58.259
THE PRICE OF A HOME IN

03:23:58.326 --> 03:24:01.228
CALIFORNIA IS TWO POINT FIVE

03:24:01.295 --> 03:24:04.198
TIMES THE U. S. AVERAGE SO MOST

03:24:04.265 --> 03:24:05.466
ANY OTHER STATE YOU GO TO YOU

03:24:05.533 --> 03:24:06.901
WILL PAY.

03:24:06.968 --> 03:24:08.002
LESS.

03:24:08.069 --> 03:24:09.537
AND YOU WILL HEAR PAY TWO POINT

03:24:09.604 --> 03:24:11.539
FIVE TIMES.

03:24:11.606 --> 03:24:14.175
OF THE FIFTY CITIES IN THE US

03:24:14.241 --> 03:24:16.677
WITH THE HIGHEST RENTS THIRTY

03:24:16.744 --> 03:24:19.714
THREE OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA.

03:24:19.780 --> 03:24:22.049
ARE HOMELESS POPULATION WHICH I

03:24:22.116 --> 03:24:24.151
THINK ALL OF US ARE.

03:24:24.218 --> 03:24:26.187
IT WE CAN HARDLY LIVE WITH

03:24:26.253 --> 03:24:28.522
OURSELVES BECAUSE WE TO SEE IN

03:24:28.589 --> 03:24:30.658
THIS RICHEST NATION AND IN THIS

03:24:30.725 --> 03:24:32.426
STATE WHICH IS THE FIFTH HIGHEST

03:24:32.493 --> 03:24:33.661
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. TO SEE

03:24:33.728 --> 03:24:35.129
PEOPLE.

03:24:35.196 --> 03:24:37.565
IN ON SIDEWALKS IN DOORWAYS AND

03:24:37.632 --> 03:24:39.700
INTENT ENCAMPMENTS WE CAN'T

03:24:39.767 --> 03:24:40.334
BELIEVE THAT WE'VE COME TO THIS

03:24:40.401 --> 03:24:41.402
PLACE.

03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:44.872
WHY HAS HOMELESSNESS GREW 16%

03:24:44.939 --> 03:24:47.842
JUST FROM?

03:24:47.908 --> 03:24:48.342
TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

03:24:48.409 --> 03:24:49.910
SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THE COST OF

03:24:49.977 --> 03:24:52.880
HOUSING ARE TOO HIGH.

03:24:52.947 --> 03:24:54.715
THOSE NEWLY HOMELESS.

03:24:54.782 --> 03:24:57.051
ARE NOT MENTALLY ILL ARE NOT

03:24:57.118 --> 03:24:58.252
ADDICTED.

03:24:58.319 --> 03:25:00.354
THEY HAVE JOBS AND THEY HAVE

03:25:00.421 --> 03:25:03.624
NEVER BEFOREBEEN HOMELESS.

03:25:03.691 --> 03:25:06.260
THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE

03:25:06.327 --> 03:25:07.995
IN CALIFORNIA UNDER OUR CURRENT

03:25:08.062 --> 03:25:09.096
PRICES.

03:25:09.163 --> 03:25:10.631
KNOW WHAT MY BILL DOES IS

03:25:10.698 --> 03:25:11.932
RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE'RE IN A

03:25:11.999 --> 03:25:14.702
CRISIS IF WE TAKE OTHER CRISES.

03:25:14.769 --> 03:25:16.604
FOR EXAMPLE ALL YOU SANTA ROSA

03:25:16.671 --> 03:25:18.606
IS A GREAT EXAMPLE AFTER THAT

03:25:18.673 --> 03:25:21.208
HORRIFIC FIRE AND SANTA ROSA

03:25:21.275 --> 03:25:22.576
LOST SO MANY HOUSING UNITS

03:25:22.643 --> 03:25:24.178
GENERAL'S A NEW.

03:25:24.245 --> 03:25:25.913
WE NEED TO GET BACK TO NORMAL SO

03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:27.615
THEY RELAXED SOME OF THE RULES

03:25:27.682 --> 03:25:30.217
THE STREAMLINED PROCESS SEES.

03:25:30.284 --> 03:25:32.920
GET IN THOSE HOMES BACK.

03:25:32.987 --> 03:25:34.488
WELL WE'RE NOT HERE TALKING

03:25:34.555 --> 03:25:36.190
ABOUT HOW TO GET HOMES BACK

03:25:36.257 --> 03:25:39.460
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW. TO GET

03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:41.228
MORE UNITS ADDED AS QUICKLY AS

03:25:41.295 --> 03:25:42.830
POSSIBLE.

03:25:42.897 --> 03:25:46.667
NOW SB. THREE THIRTY WELL SOME

03:25:46.734 --> 03:25:48.102
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT OR

03:25:48.169 --> 03:25:50.104
THINK THAT IT'S AN OVER REACH

03:25:50.171 --> 03:25:51.072
IT'S REALLY A VERY MODEST

03:25:51.138 --> 03:25:51.672
MEASURE.

03:25:51.739 --> 03:25:54.508
BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER BILLS IT

03:25:54.575 --> 03:25:57.978
DOESN'T ASK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

03:25:58.045 --> 03:26:00.715
TO CHANGE THEIR ZONING OR TWO IN

03:26:00.781 --> 03:26:02.116
A WHOLE VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS

03:26:02.183 --> 03:26:03.484
IT SAYS LOOK.

03:26:03.551 --> 03:26:04.819
IF WE LOOK AT YOUR EXISTING

03:26:04.885 --> 03:26:06.754
ZONING THERE IS A LOT HOUSING

03:26:06.821 --> 03:26:08.756
THAT COULD FEEL THAT YOU ARE

03:26:08.823 --> 03:26:10.357
ALREADY THROUGH YOUR GENERAL

03:26:10.424 --> 03:26:11.592
PLAN THROUGH YOUR SECRET

03:26:11.659 --> 03:26:12.727
DOCUMENTS OR ANYTHING THAT

03:26:12.793 --> 03:26:15.463
YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED TO ALLOW.

03:26:15.529 --> 03:26:17.665
SO WE'RE JUST SAYING OKAY.

03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:21.302
DO WHAT YOU DO BUT DO IT FASTER

03:26:21.368 --> 03:26:22.837
DO IT MORE EFFICIENTLY.

03:26:22.903 --> 03:26:25.139
AND TRIED TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT

03:26:25.206 --> 03:26:27.641
REDUCES THE COST TO THE PERSON

03:26:27.708 --> 03:26:29.210
WHO IS BUILDING BECAUSE IF WE

03:26:29.276 --> 03:26:30.678
CAN REDUCE THE COST OF THAT

03:26:30.745 --> 03:26:31.812
HOUSING.

03:26:31.879 --> 03:26:33.380
WE NEED BOTH MARKET RATE IN

03:26:33.447 --> 03:26:34.648
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED BOTH

03:26:34.715 --> 03:26:35.850
KINDS.

03:26:35.916 --> 03:26:37.251
BUT IF WE CAN [inaudible]

03:26:37.318 --> 03:26:38.886
STREAMLINED.

03:26:38.953 --> 03:26:40.821
AND NOT HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:26:40.888 --> 03:26:43.190
CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM.

03:26:43.257 --> 03:26:45.960
OR NOT ENACT GROWTH CAPS AND

03:26:46.026 --> 03:26:48.395
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD STOP

03:26:48.462 --> 03:26:49.930
AND GO BACKWARDS ON HOUSING.

03:26:49.997 --> 03:26:51.699
JUST FOR A LIMITED TIME PERIOD

03:26:51.766 --> 03:26:53.000
THIS BILL WOULD ONLY GOING TO

03:26:53.067 --> 03:26:54.568
AFFECT FOR TEN YEARS.

03:26:54.635 --> 03:26:55.736
THEN WE MIGHT HAVE THE HOPE OF

03:26:55.803 --> 03:26:56.937
GETTING.

03:26:57.004 --> 03:26:58.739
THE THREE MILLION.

03:26:58.806 --> 03:27:02.042
UNITS BETWEEN NOW AND TWO THIRTY

03:27:02.109 --> 03:27:03.244
THIRD TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

03:27:03.310 --> 03:27:04.478
ACTUALLY THAT GO UP BUT IT WILL

03:27:04.545 --> 03:27:07.081
IT'S PROBABLY HARD TO DO THAT BY

03:27:07.148 --> 03:27:08.082
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT STILL

03:27:08.149 --> 03:27:08.916
THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAYS WE

03:27:08.983 --> 03:27:09.917
NEED.

03:27:09.984 --> 03:27:12.186
THAT'S WHAT THE LA -- SAYS WE

03:27:12.253 --> 03:27:15.189
NEED EVERY REPORT THAT LOOKS AT

03:27:15.256 --> 03:27:18.626
OUR CRISIS SAYS WE NEED AT LEAST

03:27:18.692 --> 03:27:20.528
THREE MILLION MORE UNITS IN TEN

03:27:20.594 --> 03:27:22.530
OR SO YEARS SO HOW DO YOU GET

03:27:22.596 --> 03:27:23.597
THOSE FASTEST.

03:27:23.664 --> 03:27:25.399
BY LETTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO

03:27:25.466 --> 03:27:27.067
WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY DONE BUT DO

03:27:27.134 --> 03:27:29.270
IT FASTER AND DO IT MORE

03:27:29.336 --> 03:27:30.137
EFFICIENTLY.

03:27:30.204 --> 03:27:31.438
I WILL LET MY WITNESSES SPEAK IN

03:27:31.505 --> 03:27:32.807
SUPPORT AND THEN I'LL JUST

03:27:32.873 --> 03:27:34.275

03:27:34.341 --> 03:27:35.075
SPECIFICS ARE.

WE ALWAYS SAY IN OUR LINE OF

03:28:24.058 --> 03:28:25.125
WORK THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN

03:28:25.192 --> 03:28:26.393
COMPONENTS TO BUILDING

03:28:26.460 --> 03:28:28.629
AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- LAND OF

WITH THE POLITICAL WILL SIDE OF

WITH ANY OTHER HOUSING

03:28:39.306 --> 03:28:41.075
DEVELOPMENT IS SUBJECT TO LOCAL

03:28:41.141 --> 03:28:45.246
RULES -- AND WHILE WE ARE HPPY

03:28:45.312 --> 03:28:47.114
TO FOLLOW THE RULES THAT ARE SET

03:28:47.181 --> 03:28:48.549
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SOMETIMES

03:28:48.616 --> 03:28:49.650
THOSE RULES ARE CHANGED

03:28:49.717 --> 03:28:51.218
MIDSTREAM.

03:28:51.285 --> 03:28:52.686
AND SB THREE THIRTY WILL CREATE

03:28:52.753 --> 03:28:54.221
MORE CLARITY THAT THE RULES

UNDER WHICH THE PROJECT WAS

03:28:55.589 --> 03:28:56.457
APPROVED.

03:28:56.523 --> 03:28:58.158
I WILL NOT MIDWAY THROUGH THE

03:28:58.225 --> 03:29:00.895
PROCESS WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A

03:29:00.961 --> 03:29:02.997
PROJECT IN BERKELEY WHERE AFTER

03:29:03.063 --> 03:29:04.164
HAD BEEN APPROVED THE CHANGE THE

PARKING REQUIREMENTS RESULTING

03:29:05.966 --> 03:29:06.767
IN.

03:29:06.834 --> 03:29:08.769
NEEDS TO SEEK MORE SUBSIDIES TO

03:29:08.836 --> 03:29:10.170
SUBSIDIZE ESSENTIALLY MORE

03:29:10.237 --> 03:29:11.605
PARKING UNIT.

03:29:11.672 --> 03:29:13.207
AND WE THINK THAT THE AFFORDABLE

03:29:13.274 --> 03:29:14.675
HOUSING CRISIS IS.

03:29:14.742 --> 03:29:16.443

ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO TEN YEARS

03:29:24.385 --> 03:29:26.520
TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY.

03:29:26.587 --> 03:29:27.888
AND BY LIMITING THE APPROVAL

03:29:27.955 --> 03:29:30.157

03:30:07.461 --> 03:30:08.429
DAVID GARCIA.

03:30:08.495 --> 03:30:10.331
I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE

03:30:10.397 --> 03:30:11.832
TURSUNOV ROUSING INNOVATION AT

03:30:11.899 --> 03:30:13.467
UC BERKELEY AND I'M HERE TODAY

03:30:13.534 --> 03:30:14.535

03:30:14.601 --> 03:30:17.604
SENATE BILL. THREE THIRTY I

03:30:17.671 --> 03:30:18.372
DON'T THINK I I NEED.

03:30:18.439 --> 03:30:20.074
TO LABOR THE POINT CALIFORNIA IS

03:30:20.140 --> 03:30:21.575
IN THE THROES OF A VERY DEEP AND

03:30:21.642 --> 03:30:22.376
WE'RE STAYING.

03:30:22.443 --> 03:30:25.212
HOUSING CRISIS AND A BILL SUCH

03:30:25.279 --> 03:30:27.548
AS SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY

03:30:27.614 --> 03:30:28.949
REPRESENT A BOLD STEP TOWARDS

03:30:29.016 --> 03:30:30.551
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE HEAD ON

03:30:30.617 --> 03:30:32.286
TODAY MORE THAN 50% OF RENTERS

03:30:32.353 --> 03:30:33.320
IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONSIDERED

03:30:33.387 --> 03:30:34.621
RENT BURDENED.

03:30:34.688 --> 03:30:37.157
AND OF THOSE 30% ARE CONSIDERED

03:30:37.224 --> 03:30:38.258
SEVERELY RENT FOR IT.

03:30:38.325 --> 03:30:40.060
AND ON TOP OF THAT OWNING A HOME

03:30:40.127 --> 03:30:41.428
HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

03:30:41.495 --> 03:30:42.896
UNACHIEVABLE AS WELL AS WE ARE

03:30:42.963 --> 03:30:43.831
WITNESSING.

03:30:43.897 --> 03:30:45.632
THE LOWEST RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

03:30:45.699 --> 03:30:47.001
SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES.

03:30:47.067 --> 03:30:48.502
AND AS OUR WORK AT THE TURNER

03:30:48.569 --> 03:30:50.170
CENTER HAS SHOWN THIS LACK OF

03:30:50.237 --> 03:30:51.271
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

03:30:51.338 --> 03:30:52.773
OFTENTIMES IS PUSHING PEOPLE OUT

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:54.508
OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WHICH IN

03:30:54.575 --> 03:30:55.809
MANY CASES MEANS THAT THEY'RE

03:30:55.876 --> 03:30:59.179
LEAVING THE STATE ENTIRELY.

03:30:59.246 --> 03:31:00.714
SO THE SCALE OF THE CHALLENGE IN

03:31:00.781 --> 03:31:02.549
FRONT OF US REALLY DEMANDS

03:31:02.616 --> 03:31:04.018
POLICIES THAT MATCH THE

03:31:04.084 --> 03:31:05.686
MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM AND

03:31:05.753 --> 03:31:07.855
THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS ON THE

03:31:07.921 --> 03:31:09.490
TABLE THAT ARE AS BOLD.

03:31:09.556 --> 03:31:12.226
AS WHAT SENATE BILL.

03:31:12.292 --> 03:31:14.028
THREE THIRTY HOUSES SO BY

03:31:14.094 --> 03:31:15.429
PROHIBITING CITIES FROM ENACTING

03:31:15.496 --> 03:31:18.365
MORATORIUM'S OR OR DOWN ZONING

03:31:18.432 --> 03:31:20.000
THAT WOULD DIMINISH THE CAPACITY

03:31:20.067 --> 03:31:21.702
FOR YOU HOUSING WE'RE SENDING A

03:31:21.769 --> 03:31:22.469
CLEAR.

03:31:22.536 --> 03:31:25.305
AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE THAT WE

03:31:25.372 --> 03:31:27.808
ARE NO LONGER GOING TO TOLERATE.

03:31:27.875 --> 03:31:28.609
LOOKING PEOPLE OF OUR

03:31:28.675 --> 03:31:29.977
COMMUNITIES THROUGH EXCLUSIONARY

03:31:30.044 --> 03:31:33.881
PRACTICES ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE

03:31:33.947 --> 03:31:35.015
OF ONGOING HOUSING PRESSURES.

03:31:35.082 --> 03:31:36.250
SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY WILL

03:31:36.316 --> 03:31:38.452
ALSO DO YOU VERY MUCH TO ADDRESS

03:31:38.519 --> 03:31:40.888
THE COST OF HOUSING BY MODIFYING

03:31:40.954 --> 03:31:42.890
HOWELL PARKING REQUIREMENTS ARE

03:31:42.956 --> 03:31:44.992
STRUCTURED.

03:31:45.059 --> 03:31:46.627
BY MODIFYING HOW FEES ARE

03:31:46.693 --> 03:31:48.762
IMPOSED AND BY CURBING OTHERWISE

03:31:48.829 --> 03:31:49.663
REQUIREMENTS OUR WORK HAS SHOWN

03:31:49.730 --> 03:31:50.297
THAT.

03:31:50.364 --> 03:31:52.833
WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER THESE

03:31:52.900 --> 03:31:54.234
REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES

03:31:54.301 --> 03:31:56.603
CUMULATIVELY WILL RAISE THE COST

03:31:56.670 --> 03:31:58.138
TO BUILD NEW HOUSING?

03:31:58.205 --> 03:32:00.340
SO -- MANY CITIES CONTINUE TO

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.376
WORK IN GOOD FAITH TO REDUCE

03:32:02.443 --> 03:32:03.911
BARRIERS TO HOUSING.

03:32:03.977 --> 03:32:05.412
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME

03:32:05.479 --> 03:32:07.214
THAT RELY ON EXCLUSION PRACTICES

03:32:07.281 --> 03:32:08.282

03:34:15.175 --> 03:34:17.544
MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE STRUCTURE

03:34:17.611 --> 03:34:19.980
OR THE IDEA THAT THERE SHOULD BE

03:34:20.047 --> 03:34:21.582
SOME THINGS THAT JUST ARE NOT

THE BILL -- WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE

03:34:43.971 --> 03:34:45.305
A SUB OPPOSE IT LESS AMENDED

03:34:45.372 --> 03:34:48.041
HOWEVER THE BILL IS NOT CLEAR

03:34:48.108 --> 03:34:49.543
AND IT MAY BE CLEARER FOR

03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:50.644
DEVELOPERS I DON'T KNOW BUT

03:34:50.711 --> 03:34:51.845
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN THE

UNDERSTAND OURSELVES HOW WE BE

03:34:58.151 --> 03:34:59.586
ABLE TO COMPLY.

03:34:59.653 --> 03:35:00.921
IT ISN'T CLEAR WHAT

JURISDICTIONS ARE IN AND ARE OUT

03:35:02.723 --> 03:35:03.991

WHATEVER YOU END UP WITH IS

DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY SO --

03:35:53.540 --> 03:35:54.441
WE DO HAVE SOME THINGS THAT WE

03:35:54.508 --> 03:35:55.742

AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO

03:36:09.523 --> 03:36:10.157

03:36:10.223 --> 03:36:12.526
I'M TO WORK IS THAT ALMOST SORT

03:36:12.592 --> 03:36:14.895

ALL AGREE ON ADMISSION FOR THERE

03:36:17.164 --> 03:36:18.332
CERTAINLY IS HOUSING CRISIS AND

03:36:18.398 --> 03:36:19.199
WE NEED TO BUILD HOMES.

03:36:19.266 --> 03:36:21.234
FASTER AND WE NEED A LOT MORE OF

03:36:21.301 --> 03:36:21.735
THEM AND WE'RE CERTAINLY

03:36:21.802 --> 03:36:22.369
COMMITTED.

03:36:22.436 --> 03:36:23.537
TO HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME

03:36:23.603 --> 03:36:24.738
PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT I

03:36:24.805 --> 03:36:25.872
THINK WHAT YOU TAKE AWAY FROM

03:36:25.939 --> 03:36:27.441
THAT AND AND ONE GOOD EXAMPLE OF

03:36:27.507 --> 03:36:28.075
THAT IS.

03:36:28.141 --> 03:36:29.609
YOU KNOW THE FREEZING OF IMPACT

03:36:29.676 --> 03:36:31.678
FEES FOR THAT DECADE -- AND

03:36:31.745 --> 03:36:33.213
OTHER FEES AND EXACTIONS THAT

03:36:33.280 --> 03:36:34.781
WOULD ACTUALLY PRECLUDED FROM

03:36:34.848 --> 03:36:35.549
IMPLEMENTING BILLS THAT PASSED

03:36:35.615 --> 03:36:37.384
THIS LEGISLATURE LIKE AB FIFTY

03:36:37.451 --> 03:36:38.585
NO FIVE EXPANDED INCLUSIONARY

03:36:38.652 --> 03:36:39.953
ORDINANCES TO INCLUDE RENTAL

03:36:40.020 --> 03:36:40.954
HOUSING.

03:36:41.021 --> 03:36:41.888
THAT'S A POLICY THE STATE WANTS

03:36:41.955 --> 03:36:43.156
OUR CITIES TO ADVANCE WE WOULD

03:36:43.223 --> 03:36:44.624
BE PRECLUDED FROM DOING THAT IN

03:36:44.691 --> 03:36:45.892
THIS BILL FOR A DECADE.

03:36:45.959 --> 03:36:47.894
THE SAME GOES FOR RENT CONTROL

03:36:47.961 --> 03:36:49.696
UNDER EXISTING LAW NOW CITIES

03:36:49.763 --> 03:36:51.164
CAN IMPOSE RENT CONTROL ON THE

03:36:51.231 --> 03:36:52.566
LAWN THE FALL COSTA HAWKINS.

03:36:52.632 --> 03:36:53.934
AGAIN THIS WOULD PRECLUDE CITIES

03:36:54.000 --> 03:36:56.436
FROM TAKING THOSE ACTIONS FOR

03:36:56.503 --> 03:37:00.173
THAT DECADE SO.

03:37:00.240 --> 03:37:01.241
AND SO -- WE CERTAINLY THINK

03:37:01.308 --> 03:37:01.775
THAT THAT WOULD NEED TO BE

03:37:01.842 --> 03:37:02.342
MODIFIED THE PARKING

03:37:02.409 --> 03:37:03.176
REQUIREMENTS I'M THAT'S

03:37:03.243 --> 03:37:04.211
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW OUR

03:37:04.277 --> 03:37:05.979
LOCALS ALWAYS LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

03:37:06.046 --> 03:37:06.980
TO MANAGE SO THAT WE CAN MANAGE

03:37:07.047 --> 03:37:08.081
PARKING OR COMMUNITIES THIS

03:37:08.148 --> 03:37:09.449
AGAIN WOULD FREEZE OUR ABILITY

03:37:09.516 --> 03:37:10.450
TO POSE ANY OF PARKING

03:37:10.517 --> 03:37:11.618
REQUIREMENTS FOR A DECADE.

03:37:11.685 --> 03:37:12.652
WHICH AS THE DEVELOPERS

03:37:12.719 --> 03:37:14.454
MENTIONED EARLIER -- WOULD SAVE

03:37:14.521 --> 03:37:15.789
A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY WHICH IS

03:37:15.856 --> 03:37:17.557
AND IN FACT THE CASE BUT THE

03:37:17.624 --> 03:37:19.192
STATE ISN'T CAPTURING THAT.

03:37:19.259 --> 03:37:20.660
IF YOU USE EXISTING DESI BONUS

03:37:20.727 --> 03:37:22.662
ON NOW -- AND YOU DO GET A

03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:24.264
WAIVER FROM PARKING REQUIREMENTS

03:37:24.331 --> 03:37:25.198
WE GET AFFORDABLEUNITS OUT OF

03:37:25.265 --> 03:37:25.799
THAT.

03:37:25.866 --> 03:37:27.334
I'M THIS WOULDN'T PASS ON THAT

03:37:27.401 --> 03:37:29.836
SAVINGS OR GUARANTEE THAT ANY OF

03:37:29.903 --> 03:37:31.238
THESE UNITS WILL BE BUILT OR

03:37:31.304 --> 03:37:32.839
RENTED MORE CHEAPLY.

03:37:32.906 --> 03:37:33.907
THE COST MY GO DOWN FOR THE

03:37:33.974 --> 03:37:34.908
DEVELOPER BUT THERE'S NO

03:37:34.975 --> 03:37:35.542
ASSURANCES THAT THE RENTS WILL

03:37:35.609 --> 03:37:37.411
GO DOWN OR THE FOR SALE PRICE

03:37:37.477 --> 03:37:38.311
WILL GO DOWN.

03:37:38.378 --> 03:37:39.446
SO AGAIN WE THINK THAT'S

03:37:39.513 --> 03:37:40.247
SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY SHOULD

03:37:40.313 --> 03:37:43.150
BE LOOKED AT AS THE BILL MOVES

03:37:43.216 --> 03:37:43.917
FORWARD.

03:37:43.984 --> 03:37:44.785
AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST

03:37:44.851 --> 03:37:45.485
LIKE TO SAY THOUGH THAT IF YOU

03:37:45.552 --> 03:37:47.087
FREEZE THE OUR FEES FOR TEN

03:37:47.154 --> 03:37:48.088
YEARS COSTS WILL CONTAIN TO GO

03:37:48.155 --> 03:37:49.523
UP NO MATTER WHAT.

03:37:49.589 --> 03:37:50.557
AND THEN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE

03:37:50.624 --> 03:37:51.458
TO NECESSARY PROVIDE THAT

03:37:51.525 --> 03:37:52.492
SERVICE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

03:37:52.559 --> 03:37:54.161

ORDER TO FILL IN THE GAPS OVER

03:37:54.995 --> 03:37:55.595
THAT DECADE.

03:37:55.662 --> 03:37:58.031
OR WE WILL PROVIDE THAT SERVICE

03:37:58.098 --> 03:37:59.399
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S

03:37:59.466 --> 03:38:00.000
SOMETHING THAT'S A LEGISLATURE

03:38:00.066 --> 03:38:01.668
WANTS US TO DO AND WITH THAT WE

03:38:01.735 --> 03:38:02.235
WILL BE CONTENT OR FOR THE

03:40:24.644 --> 03:40:26.379

SWEET SPOT -- WHAT WE WERE

03:41:12.592 --> 03:41:14.427
REALLY TRYING TO DO IS I OPENED

03:41:14.494 --> 03:41:18.031
IN THE BILL IS? TO GET.

03:41:18.098 --> 03:41:20.467
THE THREE MILLION UNITS UP AND

03:41:20.533 --> 03:41:21.401
DOWN THE STATE AS QUICKLY AS

03:41:21.468 --> 03:41:22.836
POSSIBLE.

03:41:22.902 --> 03:41:25.005
WE WERE TRYING [inaudible]

03:41:25.071 --> 03:41:26.806
TO SHE VIçT.

03:41:26.873 --> 03:41:29.242
AT WITH ALSO REDUCING COST

03:41:29.309 --> 03:41:31.845
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT PART OF THE

03:41:31.911 --> 03:41:33.380
PROBLEM IS AFFORDABILITY AND WE

03:41:33.446 --> 03:41:34.714
DON'T WANT.

03:41:34.781 --> 03:41:36.516
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR MARKET

03:41:36.583 --> 03:41:37.951
RATE HOUSING TO BE ANY MORE

03:41:38.018 --> 03:41:39.386
EXPENSIVE.

03:41:39.452 --> 03:41:41.287
THAN IT SHOULD BE ANOTHER WORDS

03:41:41.354 --> 03:41:43.823
WE DON'T ADD TO THE COST OF THAT

03:41:43.890 --> 03:41:45.325
MARKET RATE WHERE WE COULD AVOID

03:41:45.392 --> 03:41:47.293
SO THAT WE CAN KEEP SOME LEVEL

03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:48.995
OF AFFORDABILITY NOW CLEARLY

03:41:49.062 --> 03:41:52.032
THIS BILL DOES NOT INTERFERE.

03:41:52.098 --> 03:41:53.566
WITH ANY JURISDICTIONS.

03:41:53.633 --> 03:41:57.270
ON DENSITY BONUS ORDINANCES OR

03:41:57.337 --> 03:41:59.272
INCLUSIONARY ORDINANCES IT DOES

03:41:59.339 --> 03:42:01.141
NOT IT RESPECT ALL OF THOSE SO

03:42:01.207 --> 03:42:03.309
IT HAS A AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:42:03.376 --> 03:42:04.978
COMPONENT IN THAT FROM THAT

03:42:05.045 --> 03:42:06.179
POINT OF VIEW.

03:42:06.246 --> 03:42:08.081
BUT OF COURSE IT ALSO SUPPORTS

03:42:08.148 --> 03:42:09.749
THE MARKET RATE HOUSING BUT WE

03:42:09.816 --> 03:42:11.418
WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE IT.

03:42:11.484 --> 03:42:14.020
OUT LOWEST COST AS POSSIBLE SO

03:42:14.087 --> 03:42:16.256
THE ISSUE OF SPEED WHAT'S THE IT

03:42:16.322 --> 03:42:18.491
MAKES HOUSING EXPENSIVE BESIDE

03:42:18.558 --> 03:42:21.261
SCARCITY IT IS THE TIME IT TAKES

03:42:21.327 --> 03:42:23.063
FROM THE POINT YOU. SEVEN YOU

03:42:23.129 --> 03:42:24.364
KNOW TRY TO GET YOUR PERMIT TO

03:42:24.431 --> 03:42:25.799
THE POINT YOU GET TO BUILD IT.

03:42:25.865 --> 03:42:27.834
AND ANY COSTLY REQUIREMENTS THAT

03:42:27.901 --> 03:42:29.836
ARE ADDED WHETHER THAT'S PARKING

03:42:29.903 --> 03:42:32.605
OR OTHER THINGS SO BUT WE WE

03:42:32.672 --> 03:42:34.174
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

03:42:34.240 --> 03:42:35.975
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:42:36.042 --> 03:42:37.844
OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF COURSE

03:42:37.911 --> 03:42:38.778
LIKE ANY MEMBER.

03:42:38.845 --> 03:42:41.147
ANY AUTHOR I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

03:42:41.214 --> 03:42:41.681
A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE NO

03:42:41.748 --> 03:42:43.383
OPPOSITION -- WHETHER I CAN

03:42:43.450 --> 03:42:46.386
ACHIEVE THAT OR NOT DON'T KNOW

03:42:46.453 --> 03:42:48.488
BUT I WILL CERTAINLY TRY.

03:42:48.555 --> 03:42:49.823

PERMISSION TO PUT A MORATORIUM

03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:07.767
ON HOUSING.

03:44:07.834 --> 03:44:10.403
THESE ARE MOSTLY [inaudible]

03:44:10.470 --> 03:44:14.307
AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY.

03:44:14.374 --> 03:44:16.810
TYPE OF GROWTH MANAGEMENT ORDER.

03:44:16.876 --> 03:44:19.179
MANY HAVE BEEN LOOSING SINCE THE

03:44:19.245 --> 03:44:19.779
ORIGINAL óRDENES HAVE BEEN IN

03:44:19.846 --> 03:44:20.947
BACK.

03:44:21.014 --> 03:44:22.882
I IN WHERE AND I'LL LET TENER

03:44:22.949 --> 03:44:24.184
SKINNER FILLING SHE THINK THAT

03:44:24.250 --> 03:44:26.119
I'M MISREPRESENTING.

03:44:26.186 --> 03:44:28.221
I'M IT WAS.

03:44:28.288 --> 03:44:30.190
OUR BELIEF THAT WE SHOULD NARROW

03:44:30.256 --> 03:44:30.757
WHAT THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION

03:44:30.824 --> 03:44:32.425
WHAT.

03:44:32.492 --> 03:44:34.561
IT IS NOT FOCUS ON ACTIONS THAT

03:44:34.627 --> 03:44:36.095
HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADMINISTRATIVELY

03:44:36.162 --> 03:44:39.599
BY COUNSEL. FOR MAINSTREAM PLAN

03:44:39.666 --> 03:44:41.634
BUT SIMPLY VOTER APPROVED.

03:44:41.701 --> 03:44:43.336
IT'S FULL FOCUS AN AGRICULTURAL

03:44:43.403 --> 03:44:44.637
COUNTIES.

03:44:44.704 --> 03:44:47.106
WHERE GROWTH INTO AG LANDS WOULD

03:44:47.173 --> 03:44:49.242
BE THE GREATEST THREAT?

03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:50.844
BECAUSE I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A

03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:52.645
PROBLEM WHEN AGRICULTURAL AREAS

03:44:52.712 --> 03:44:54.814
SAY WE WANT TO PRESERVE OUR OUR

03:44:54.881 --> 03:44:56.783
OUR OUR FARMLAND I DON'T PROBLEM

03:44:56.850 --> 03:44:57.483
WITH THAT.

03:44:57.550 --> 03:44:58.685
WHAT WHAT I DO HAVE AN ISSUE

03:44:58.751 --> 03:45:01.020
WITH THIS ONE COMMUNITIES DECIDE

03:45:01.087 --> 03:45:02.021
WE'RE GOING?

03:45:02.088 --> 03:45:03.256
TO LOCK DOWN AND NOT HAVE NEW

03:45:03.323 --> 03:45:04.991
HOUSING FOR A MORATORIUM ON

03:45:05.058 --> 03:45:06.159
HOUSING.

03:45:06.226 --> 03:45:07.760
I SOME DO IT THROUGH A

03:45:07.827 --> 03:45:09.729
POPULATION COP WHICH IS BIZARRE

03:45:09.796 --> 03:45:12.332
AND OUTRAGEOUS TO ME -- AND THEN

03:45:12.398 --> 03:45:13.867
WERE A NUMERICAL THING HAVE NO

03:45:13.933 --> 03:45:15.401
MORE THAN EXT NUMBER OF HOUSING

03:45:15.468 --> 03:45:16.369
UNITS.

03:45:16.436 --> 03:45:17.704
AND SO I DISTINGUISH BETWEEN

03:45:17.770 --> 03:45:19.606
SAYING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:45:19.672 --> 03:45:21.007
WE'RE NOT ENCROACHING ON TO OUR

03:45:21.074 --> 03:45:22.709
PROBLEM WITH FRANK GUYS I AM

03:45:22.775 --> 03:45:24.210
OKAY WITH THAT -- AND YOU DO

03:45:24.277 --> 03:45:27.347
THAT GROUP BUILDING MORE HOUSING

03:45:27.413 --> 03:45:28.147
AND URBANIZED AREAS.

03:45:28.214 --> 03:45:29.649
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN.

03:45:29.716 --> 03:45:31.517
PUTTING A MORATORIUM OR A OR A

03:45:31.584 --> 03:45:33.386
COP SAYING.

03:45:33.453 --> 03:45:34.787
IN IN THROUGH OUR RESEARCH.

03:45:34.854 --> 03:45:37.957
OVER THE LAST WEEK WE CAN HALF.

03:45:38.024 --> 03:45:39.726
IT WOULD BE MORE CAP ON NUMBER

03:45:39.792 --> 03:45:42.362
OF UNITS BUT NOT ON POPULATION.

03:45:42.428 --> 03:45:44.364
OKAY NUMBER OF UNITS SO FOR

03:45:44.430 --> 03:45:45.231
EXAMPLE.

03:45:45.298 --> 03:45:47.400
YOU HAVE A IT'S NOT A IN A NOT

03:45:47.467 --> 03:45:48.301
AT ALL TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT --

03:45:48.368 --> 03:45:49.936
BECAUSE I KNOW I KNOW YEAH IT'S

03:45:50.003 --> 03:45:51.337
IT'S THERE ARE.

03:45:51.404 --> 03:45:52.105
THEY'RE JUST DIFFERENT

03:45:52.171 --> 03:45:54.540
DEFINITIONS OUT THERE BUT RIGHT

03:45:54.607 --> 03:45:56.309
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE LET'S

03:45:56.376 --> 03:45:57.710
SAY IF TOWN.

03:45:57.777 --> 03:46:00.146
THAT IS SURROUNDED BY FARMLAND.

03:46:00.213 --> 03:46:04.284
SO -- SO YEAH ARE THESE

03:46:04.350 --> 03:46:05.485
SITUATIONS WHERE THE TOWN HAS

03:46:05.551 --> 03:46:07.253
SAID YOU CAN INCLUDE IN THE FARM

03:46:07.320 --> 03:46:07.987
LAND.

03:46:08.054 --> 03:46:09.455
OR WE'RE GONNA SAY IN OUR

03:46:09.522 --> 03:46:12.091
URBANITE URBANIZED AREAS -- IN

03:46:12.158 --> 03:46:13.760
THE TOWN ITSELF WHICH IS NOT

03:46:13.826 --> 03:46:14.928
FORM AND WE'RE PUTTING A CAP ON

03:46:14.994 --> 03:46:16.262
THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS SOME

03:46:16.329 --> 03:46:17.697
MAY HAVE BOTH.

03:46:17.764 --> 03:46:20.133
SO IN THE ORIGINAL DISCUSSION --

03:46:20.199 --> 03:46:22.235
PLEASE ENTER SKINNER TO FREE TO

03:46:22.302 --> 03:46:23.636
ADD IN IF I AM AND STAY CAN.

03:46:23.703 --> 03:46:25.171
WE WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT URBAN

03:46:25.238 --> 03:46:26.940
GROWTH BOUNDARIES WOULD NOT BE

03:46:27.006 --> 03:46:28.308
INCLUDED WITHIN THE BILL.

03:46:28.374 --> 03:46:29.642
SO WE ACTUALLY TOOK OUT THE

03:46:29.709 --> 03:46:31.577
ISSUE OF URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES

03:46:31.644 --> 03:46:32.445
BECAUSE WE BOTH BELIEVE.

03:46:32.512 --> 03:46:33.880
THAT URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES ARE

03:46:33.947 --> 03:46:35.281
A GOOD THING.

03:46:35.348 --> 03:46:36.849
WHAT IS LEFT AND WHAT IS IN

03:46:36.916 --> 03:46:37.450
FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE HERE

03:46:37.517 --> 03:46:40.386
TODAY IS ON VOTER APPROVED

03:46:40.453 --> 03:46:42.055
GROWTH MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE --

03:46:42.121 --> 03:46:44.524
THAT HAVE BEEN OF APPROVED BY

03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:46.359
THE LOCAL LOCAL ELECTRIC -- IN

03:46:46.426 --> 03:46:48.027
TO BE ABLE TO NARROW THAT

03:46:48.094 --> 03:46:49.929
DEFINITION BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

03:46:49.996 --> 03:46:51.397
THE COMMITTEE WAS THAT.

03:46:51.464 --> 03:46:54.834
WE FOCUS ON THOSE AGRICULTURAL

03:46:54.901 --> 03:46:56.803
AND SMALLER CANCERS BUT THAT

03:46:56.869 --> 03:46:58.604
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE SOME THESE

03:46:58.671 --> 03:46:59.105
MEASURES.

03:46:59.172 --> 03:47:01.240
THE RED DOT TO GO BEYOND THE

03:47:01.307 --> 03:47:02.709
URBAN GROWTH BUT I DON'T PROBLEM

03:47:02.775 --> 03:47:08.281
WITH URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARY.

03:47:08.348 --> 03:47:10.817
BUT URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES.

03:47:10.883 --> 03:47:11.718
EARTH MANAGEMENT YOU KNOW THAT

03:47:11.784 --> 03:47:12.518
IS IT BEEN PROVED RIGHT WITHIN

03:47:12.585 --> 03:47:13.453
THE INTERIOR THE CITY WITHIN THE

03:47:13.519 --> 03:47:14.587
INTERIOR OF THE CITY IN OTHER

03:47:14.654 --> 03:47:15.822
WORDS IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT

03:47:15.888 --> 03:47:16.322
GOING TO RISK PROGRAM.

03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:17.390
I'M WONDERING IF WE COULD LIMIT

03:47:17.457 --> 03:47:18.958
THAT.

03:47:19.025 --> 03:47:21.995
EXEMPTION. TO THE PROTECTION OF

03:47:22.061 --> 03:47:23.029
FARMLAND AS OPPOSED TO SAYING IN

03:47:23.096 --> 03:47:24.597
OUR CITY WORK HOPPING THE NUMBER

03:47:24.664 --> 03:47:25.898
OF HOUSING UNITS THE BILL.

03:47:25.965 --> 03:47:27.567
HAS A AYE THE PURPOSE OF THIS

03:47:27.633 --> 03:47:30.036
BILL IS TO SAY THAT'S NOT OKAY.

A FROM WHEN I JUST AT ISSUE WELL

03:50:19.839 --> 03:50:20.306
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

03:50:20.373 --> 03:50:21.474
DISCUSSED WAS AN ISSUE AROUND

03:50:21.541 --> 03:50:26.679
TIME.

03:50:26.746 --> 03:50:28.681
WE AS YOU MENTIONED WE DID

03:50:28.748 --> 03:50:30.516
COMPLETELY AGREE ON THAT WE WERE

03:50:30.583 --> 03:50:34.353
IN NO WAY TRYING -- TO ELIMINATE

03:50:34.420 --> 03:50:36.022
GROWTH BOUNDARIES BECAUSE WE

03:50:36.088 --> 03:50:37.857
KNOW THAT IN MANY AREAS THOSE

03:50:37.924 --> 03:50:38.991
WERE ENACTED TO PROTECT

03:50:39.058 --> 03:50:40.359
AGRICULTURAL LAND -- OPEN SPACE

03:50:40.426 --> 03:50:41.961
RATHER THINGS.

03:50:42.028 --> 03:50:44.063
NOW WE DID HAVE A LOT OF BACK

03:50:44.130 --> 03:50:46.465
AND FORTH AROUND CAPPING NUMBERS

03:50:46.532 --> 03:50:49.001
OF UNITS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE

03:50:49.068 --> 03:50:50.469
WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL.

03:50:50.536 --> 03:50:53.673
I'M IS TO HELP US GET THE THREE

03:50:53.739 --> 03:50:55.608
MILLION UNITS THAT WE NEED.

03:50:55.675 --> 03:50:57.710
AND SO YOU KNOW I DID HAVE

03:50:57.777 --> 03:51:00.446
SOMEONE COME TO BILL EIGHTY
WITH.

03:51:00.513 --> 03:51:03.482
WITH AYE THOSE RESTRICTIONS BUT

03:51:03.549 --> 03:51:04.350
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

03:51:04.417 --> 03:51:05.952
DISCUSSED THAT WE DIDN'T END UP

03:51:06.018 --> 03:51:07.787
INCLUDING.

03:51:07.853 --> 03:51:09.589
THAT WE MAY WANT TO REVISIT IS

03:51:09.655 --> 03:51:10.623
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WASN'T

03:51:10.690 --> 03:51:12.358
ANY CAP ON THE NUMBER OF LOW

03:51:12.425 --> 03:51:14.493
INCOME UNITS.

03:51:14.560 --> 03:51:18.898
SO IN A YEAH WE MAY WANT.

03:51:18.965 --> 03:51:21.100
TO REVISE THE AFFORDABILITY

03:51:21.167 --> 03:51:21.601
FACTOR YEAH I THINK YEAH

03:51:21.667 --> 03:51:22.902
SOMETHING.

03:51:22.969 --> 03:51:23.903
IN ONE OF THE ITEMS I WANT BUT

03:51:23.970 --> 03:51:25.104
WORDS INTO CENTER SKINNER'S

03:51:25.171 --> 03:51:26.606
MOUTH BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

03:51:26.672 --> 03:51:28.975
THERE IS ANY ISSUE IN REGARDS TO

03:51:29.041 --> 03:51:30.276
AYE AE CAPTAIN AFFORDABLE.

03:51:30.343 --> 03:51:31.811
NO WITHIN THOSE THREE CATEGORIES

03:51:31.877 --> 03:51:33.379
THAT WOULD BE RENO WHEN AT THE

03:51:33.446 --> 03:51:36.716
MODERATE LOW THERE MAY BE SOME

03:51:36.782 --> 03:51:37.750
AND YOU KNOW WE'D HAVE TO GET

03:51:37.817 --> 03:51:39.819
GRANULAR BUT THAT'S WHERE I

03:51:39.885 --> 03:51:41.454
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME ABILITY.

03:51:41.520 --> 03:51:43.022
TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AND WORK IF

03:51:43.089 --> 03:51:46.125
WE WERE TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE

03:51:46.192 --> 03:51:48.728
WERE SOME THAT THROUGH THIS

03:51:48.794 --> 03:51:49.762
AMENDMENT.

03:51:49.829 --> 03:51:51.163
WE WERE INCLUDING.

03:51:51.230 --> 03:51:53.933
SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT MIGHT

03:51:54.000 --> 03:51:55.134
HAVE.

03:51:55.201 --> 03:51:56.435
A MEASURE THAT CAPPED LOW INCOME

03:51:56.502 --> 03:51:58.337
UNITS WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT

03:51:58.404 --> 03:51:59.805
THAT AGAIN AND WE DID NOT HAVE

03:51:59.872 --> 03:52:02.808
THE ABILITY TO LOOK IN DETAIL.

03:52:02.875 --> 03:52:04.977
NO I M. FIRM BELIEF IN REGARDS

03:52:05.044 --> 03:52:05.911

03:52:05.978 --> 03:52:08.180
I HOULD NOT BE AS WE DISCUSS

03:52:08.247 --> 03:52:10.082
RIGHT SHOULD NOT BE CAP SO HAPPY

03:52:10.149 --> 03:52:11.384
BETTER CONTINUE THAT.

03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:12.451
WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US THOUGH

03:52:12.518 --> 03:52:15.421
TODAY ARE THE AMENDMENTS I THAT

03:52:15.488 --> 03:52:16.889

03:52:24.697 --> 03:52:27.033
NEGOTIATION I THINK I EACH SIDE

03:52:27.099 --> 03:52:28.100
WALKS AWAY.

03:52:28.167 --> 03:52:29.902

03:52:34.373 --> 03:52:38.010
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WHICH

03:52:38.077 --> 03:52:39.478

AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE IN

03:52:48.754 --> 03:52:50.356

03:52:52.558 --> 03:52:53.726
COUNTY.

03:52:53.793 --> 03:52:58.130
ON THE THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES

03:52:58.197 --> 03:52:59.565
IS.

03:52:59.632 --> 03:53:01.600
IT'S FOR TEN YEARS ONLY.

03:53:01.667 --> 03:53:05.071
AND IT BASICALLY RECOGNIZES IT

03:53:05.137 --> 03:53:06.138
TELLS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WHICH

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:07.773
ALREADY DOING.

03:53:07.840 --> 03:53:09.909
BUT DO IT FASTER AND SO THE ONLY

03:53:09.975 --> 03:53:12.111
THING IT LIFTS IN THE TEN YEAR

03:53:12.178 --> 03:53:12.345
PERIOD.

03:53:12.411 --> 03:53:14.480
IS.

03:53:14.547 --> 03:53:15.881
THAT IT IT.

03:53:15.948 --> 03:53:17.717

03:53:28.661 --> 03:53:30.830
CITIES YEAH BUT WHAT IT DOES IS.

03:53:30.896 --> 03:53:33.999
IT APPLIES BASED ON HARD

03:53:34.066 --> 03:53:37.603
CRITERIA [inaudible] FOR
VACANCY.

03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:40.806
AND HI RENTS SO THERE ARE RURAL

03:53:40.873 --> 03:53:42.708
AREAS IN THE STATE THAT DON'T

GET INCLUDED.

03:53:44.510 --> 03:53:47.213
AND AND I AM CERTAINLY WILLING

03:53:47.279 --> 03:53:48.514

03:53:48.581 --> 03:53:51.350
LA -- DEVELOPED A TOOL FOR US

03:53:51.417 --> 03:53:52.284

STATE THEN AREN'T COVERED.

03:54:04.397 --> 03:54:06.031
AND THE REASON IS THAT.

03:54:06.098 --> 03:54:07.099
THIS THOSE AREAS ARE NOT

03:54:07.166 --> 03:54:08.934

REALLY A LOW VACANCY RATES SO.

03:54:16.942 --> 03:54:19.845
THIS IS NOT A NECESSITY TO ASK

03:54:19.912 --> 03:54:21.213
THEM TO DO EVERYTHING FASTER

03:54:21.280 --> 03:54:22.515

IS A VERY GOOD GOVERNANCE

04:12:17.522 --> 04:12:20.558
MEASURE TO ALLOW -- WITH SENATOR

LAST YEAR WITH SB.

04:12:41.346 --> 04:12:42.814

04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:49.787
SCOPE OF WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR
--

04:12:49.854 --> 04:12:51.589
TO ALLOW THE OPTION FOR LOCAL

04:12:51.656 --> 04:12:53.825

EXISTING LAW -- SO PRETTY SIMPLE

04:13:01.966 --> 04:13:03.001
MEASURE WE THINK THAT IT'S

04:13:03.067 --> 04:13:04.202
IMPORTANT TO ALLOW THE

04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:05.236
OPPORTUNITY.

04:13:05.303 --> 04:13:06.704

THERE'S ALL KINDS OF GAME

04:13:13.344 --> 04:13:14.846

SOLUTIONS AND ALLOW THAT OPTION

04:13:24.589 --> 04:13:26.991
AUDI WILL HOPEFULLY AVOID.

04:13:27.058 --> 04:13:28.226
EXPENSIVE VALID FIGHTS IN THE

04:13:28.293 --> 04:13:30.094
FUTURE AND THE UNINTENDED

04:13:30.161 --> 04:13:33.898

RANDALL BRADLEY THIS IS ACTUALLY

04:48:19.115 --> 04:48:20.549
MY FOURTH COUNTY HAD BEEN A FIRE

04:48:20.616 --> 04:48:22.318
CHIEF AND ACTUALLY RAN -- EMS

I READ IN SOME LOOKING COUNTY TO

04:48:31.460 --> 04:48:32.128
FIND OUT THAT.

04:48:32.194 --> 04:48:35.264
ON THE LOCAL EMS AGENCY --

04:48:35.331 --> 04:48:37.333
PREVENTED THAT TRACY FIRE

04:48:37.400 --> 04:48:38.601
DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO A

04:48:38.668 --> 04:48:40.102
MEDICAL EMERGENCIES WITH OUR

04:48:40.169 --> 04:48:41.504
JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES ON

04:48:41.570 --> 04:48:42.571
DISCOUNTED TO THE THAT DOESN'T

04:48:42.638 --> 04:48:43.572
MAKE SENSE.

04:48:43.639 --> 04:48:44.974
WE HAVE SEVERAL CALLS HAVE BEEN

04:48:45.041 --> 04:48:45.975

04:48:46.042 --> 04:48:47.643
FIREFIGHTER PARAMEDICS WERE

04:48:47.710 --> 04:48:49.745
AVAILABLE NEAR AN INCIDENT ANY

04:48:49.812 --> 04:48:50.880
THE PEOPLE SUFFERED NEEDLESSLY

04:48:50.946 --> 04:48:52.448
ARC FOR THEY DIDN'T SURVIVE YOU

04:48:52.515 --> 04:48:53.115
CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THEY WOULD

04:48:53.182 --> 04:48:54.717
HAVE SURVIVED ANYWAY BUT WE WILL

04:48:54.784 --> 04:48:57.787
NEVER KNOW NOW BECAUSE THE FIRE
--

04:48:57.853 --> 04:48:59.855
PARAMEDICS DID NOT RESPOND A LOT

04:48:59.922 --> 04:49:02.258
OF THIS IS REALLY BASED UPON --

04:49:02.324 --> 04:49:03.959
THE EMS AGENCIES WANT TO RISK

04:49:04.026 --> 04:49:04.660
YOU KNOW WANT TO CONTROL THE

04:49:04.727 --> 04:49:10.466
SYSTEM THAT IS REALLY DRIVEN BY.

04:49:10.533 --> 04:49:11.133
PRIVATE AMBULANCES AND THEIR

04:49:11.200 --> 04:49:11.901

04:49:11.967 --> 04:49:12.501

WITH WITH WITH WITH INSURANCE --

04:49:19.875 --> 04:49:21.877
I THINK THAT IT IS INHERENT FOR

04:49:21.944 --> 04:49:23.312
FIRE CHIEFS TO DETERMINE HOW

04:49:23.379 --> 04:49:24.780

04:49:24.847 --> 04:49:27.583
THEIR THEIR CITY COUNCIL OR

04:49:27.650 --> 04:49:30.553
THEIR BOARDS -- SUPPORT CAN FOR

04:49:30.619 --> 04:49:31.520
THEM FOR THE FIRE CHIEFS TO

04:49:31.587 --> 04:49:33.155
DETERMINE WHAT TYPES OF CALLS

04:49:33.222 --> 04:49:34.824
HOW WE RESPOND IN WHAT MANNER WE

04:49:34.890 --> 04:49:35.591

WE WE HAVE THE PREDICTABLE AND

04:49:40.262 --> 04:49:42.198
DEFENDABLE SYSTEM BUT IT SHOULD

04:49:42.264 --> 04:49:43.799
NOT BE DRIVEN FROM MY COUNTY

04:49:43.866 --> 04:49:45.000

HOW WAS CITY RESPONSE TO MEDICAL

04:49:46.769 --> 04:49:47.937

MCLAUGHLIN'S EXAMPLE OF

04:49:49.538 --> 04:49:51.273
UTILIZING LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT

04:49:51.340 --> 04:49:53.042

05:02:21.289 --> 05:02:22.924
THE AUTHOR.

05:02:22.991 --> 05:02:24.693
AND I WOULD ALSO THINK THAT

05:02:24.759 --> 05:02:26.261
THERE'S MERIT IN PROMOTING SOME

05:02:26.328 --> 05:02:27.562
DALOGUE.

05:02:27.629 --> 05:02:29.364

05:02:44.412 --> 05:02:45.680
FROM THE POLICE THE SHERIFF'S

05:02:45.747 --> 05:02:46.815

05:02:46.882 --> 05:02:48.149

AND THEY'RE ALL EVEN.

05:02:55.023 --> 05:02:57.592
THE END OF THAT.

05:02:57.659 --> 05:02:58.527
THAT'S NOT HEALTH INCREDIBLE

05:02:58.593 --> 05:02:59.694
THAT IS THAT THESE PEOPLE WHO

05:02:59.761 --> 05:03:01.329

05:03:02.864 --> 05:03:04.633
A HUGE CRISIS AND HOW IMPORTANT

05:03:04.699 --> 05:03:06.401
THIS IS NOW.

05:03:06.468 --> 05:03:08.803
I THINK THAT THE THE FOLKS WHO

05:03:08.870 --> 05:03:10.105
OF WHAT THE TESTIFIED TO IN IN

05:03:10.171 --> 05:03:12.307

THEIR ARGUMENTS AND I WITH.

05:03:14.409 --> 05:03:15.810
VOTE IN BOTH TRADITIONS SUCH

05:03:15.877 --> 05:03:16.278
PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE.

05:03:16.344 --> 05:03:17.946
LET'S HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

05:03:18.013 --> 05:03:19.781
DISCUSSION AND AS MS BOMB HAS

05:03:19.848 --> 05:03:21.783
INDICATED.

05:03:21.850 --> 05:03:22.551
OUR DESIRE I KNOW THAT
CERTAINLY.

05:03:22.617 --> 05:03:24.052
MISSED HERTZBERG NOBODY IS

05:03:24.119 --> 05:03:32.060
BETTER AROUND HERE WE GO SHE'D.

05:03:32.127 --> 05:03:34.262
SO I WILL BE AVAILABLE TODAY

05:03:34.329 --> 05:03:35.196
THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR NIELSEN

05:03:35.263 --> 05:03:37.065
THANK YOU BRIAN THAT PERSPECTIVE

05:03:37.132 --> 05:03:38.466
AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AS WELL

05:03:38.533 --> 05:03:38.967
SIR.

05:03:39.034 --> 05:03:41.269
THE DEAN AND SENATE -- THAT'S GO

05:03:41.336 --> 05:03:44.406
TO SENATOR ABOUT -- I'M GONNA

05:03:44.472 --> 05:03:45.240
SUPPORT THE BILL I I WANTED TO

05:03:45.307 --> 05:03:46.975
TELL YOU THOUGH I WANT TO SEE.

05:03:47.042 --> 05:03:48.310
WORK ON GETTING THE COUNTIES IN

05:03:48.376 --> 05:03:49.044
THE CITIES.

05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.844
CLOSER TOGETHER ON THIS IN TERMS

05:03:49.911 --> 05:03:50.979
OF THE HEALTH CARE.

05:03:51.046 --> 05:03:53.381
AND THERE'S SO. ONE REASON WHY I

05:03:53.448 --> 05:03:56.017
THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL. TO GET

05:03:56.084 --> 05:03:57.652
TO GO IN THIS DIRECTION IS IT.

05:03:57.719 --> 05:04:01.156
WE TRIED THE BOTH WAYS AND WIRE

05:04:01.222 --> 05:04:02.057
AND SAN JOSE.

05:04:02.123 --> 05:04:06.428
AND WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH --

05:04:06.494 --> 05:04:08.630
PRIVATE CONTRACTING THE MLS

05:04:08.697 --> 05:04:11.433
BECAUSE WE HAVE A BIG CITY WE

05:04:11.499 --> 05:04:12.634
HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF

05:04:12.701 --> 05:04:14.569
POPULATION -- MULTICULTURAL

05:04:14.636 --> 05:04:16.938
POPULATION AND WE FOUND THAT --

05:04:17.005 --> 05:04:20.976
OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD.

05:04:21.042 --> 05:04:22.711
A BETTER TRAIN FORCE TO DEAL

05:04:22.777 --> 05:04:27.015
WITH THAT KIND OF POPULATION.

05:04:27.082 --> 05:04:30.218
THEN THE EMS OF SYSTEMS.

05:04:30.285 --> 05:04:34.623
SO IT AND ALSO -- THE MEDICAL

05:04:34.689 --> 05:04:37.559
STAFF AT THE HOSPITALS ARE USED

05:04:37.626 --> 05:04:39.260
TO DEAL WITH THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT.

05:04:39.327 --> 05:04:42.497
SO THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD --

05:04:42.564 --> 05:04:45.333
AND IS STRONGER AND AND AND AND

05:04:45.400 --> 05:04:46.001
THE BOTTOM LINE WHAT'S THE

05:04:46.067 --> 05:04:48.036
BOTTOM LINE RESPONSE TIME RIGHT.

05:04:48.103 --> 05:04:50.372
SO THE RESPONSE TIMES TURNED OUT

05:04:50.438 --> 05:04:51.339
TO BE BETTER.

05:04:51.406 --> 05:04:53.708
SO SO THE PUBLIC WANTS BETTER

05:04:53.775 --> 05:04:55.076
RESPONSE TIME.

05:04:55.143 --> 05:04:56.711
WE HAD WE HAD A CONTRACTOR THAT

05:04:56.778 --> 05:04:59.047
CONSISTENTLY WAS PENALIZED FOR

05:04:59.114 --> 05:05:00.715
NOT MEETING THE STANDARDS

05:05:00.782 --> 05:05:02.417
RESPONSE TIME.

05:05:02.484 --> 05:05:04.853
THAT'S LIKE NOT ACCEPTABLE.

05:05:04.919 --> 05:05:06.554
SO YOU HAVE TO YOU YOU KNOW THE

05:05:06.621 --> 05:05:07.822
THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE.

05:05:07.889 --> 05:05:11.092
YOU KNOW THIS THIS CONCEPT IS.

05:05:11.159 --> 05:05:14.596
WHERE WE HAVE EVOLVED?

05:05:14.663 --> 05:05:16.898
TO IN TERMS OF OUR OUR
COMMUNITY.

05:05:16.965 --> 05:05:18.500
SO I JUST -- THAT'S BUT I THINK

05:05:18.566 --> 05:05:20.635
YOU HAVE TO WORK ON GETTING THE

05:05:20.702 --> 05:05:22.303
HOSPITALS.

05:05:22.370 --> 05:05:24.272
AND THE EMERGENCY -- TRAUMA

05:05:24.339 --> 05:05:26.408
CENTERS.

05:05:26.474 --> 05:05:29.844
TIGHTER WITH EMS SYSTEMS.

05:05:29.911 --> 05:05:30.879
THAT THE PROBABLY BE A

05:05:30.945 --> 05:05:32.380
SUGGESTION ON THE BILL THANK YOU

05:05:32.447 --> 05:05:33.581
THANK YOU CENTER.

05:05:33.648 --> 05:05:35.250
I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL TODAY

05:05:35.316 --> 05:05:37.585
CLOSE YES CENTERS FOR PLEASE.

05:05:37.652 --> 05:05:38.920
I JUST WANTED TO IN IT'S JUST

05:05:38.987 --> 05:05:39.688
IT'S BY I FIND IT QUITE

05:05:39.754 --> 05:05:40.889
ENLIGHTENING THE TO SHARE WITH

05:05:40.955 --> 05:05:41.656
THE COMMITTEE.

05:05:41.723 --> 05:05:42.624
OF THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY

PROVIDE A MEMO WITH THE COURT

05:05:45.226 --> 05:05:47.529
CASE -- THAT ONE POINT BUT THE

05:05:47.595 --> 05:05:50.065
THING IS PROBATIVE IS A NINETEEN

05:05:50.131 --> 05:05:50.999

AT PAGE SEVEN SIXTY ONE AND I

05:05:56.705 --> 05:05:57.305
THINK THE QUOTE INFORMS THE

05:05:57.372 --> 05:05:58.973
REASON FOR THIS MEASURE.

05:05:59.040 --> 05:06:00.341
THE LEGISLATURE APPEARS TO HAVE

05:06:00.408 --> 05:06:04.279
ASSUMED IN DRAFTING SECTION --

05:06:04.345 --> 05:06:04.846
SEVENTY NINE SEVENTY NINETY

05:06:04.913 --> 05:06:05.814
SEVEN POINT TWO OH ONE THAT

05:06:05.880 --> 05:06:07.315
SITES THAT CITY HIS ME THE

05:06:07.382 --> 05:06:08.783
CITIES AND FAR DISTRICTS HAVE

05:06:08.850 --> 05:06:10.752
INTEREST IN MAINTAINING CALL THE

05:06:10.819 --> 05:06:12.320
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.

05:06:12.387 --> 05:06:13.354
THAT ARE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY

05:06:13.421 --> 05:06:15.223
ADVERSE TO COUNTY INTEREST IN

05:06:15.290 --> 05:06:16.257
THE SAME.

05:06:16.324 --> 05:06:18.359
AND THAT THERE FOR AGREEMENTS

05:06:18.426 --> 05:06:20.095
BETWEEN THESE PUBLIC ENTITIES

05:06:20.161 --> 05:06:21.763
BOTH POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE.

05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:23.665
IF THAT ASSUMPTIONS PROVED IT IS

05:06:23.732 --> 05:06:25.166
PROVEN HISTORICALLY TO BE

05:06:25.233 --> 05:06:27.035
INCORRECT THE DISTRICT OTHER

05:06:27.102 --> 05:06:28.503
SIMILARLY SITUATED PUBLIC

05:06:28.570 --> 05:06:29.838
ENTITIES MUST RESORT TO THE

05:06:29.904 --> 05:06:32.774
LEGISLATURE NOT THE COURTS TO

05:06:32.841 --> 05:06:35.677
AMEND THE EMS ACT.

05:06:35.744 --> 05:06:37.278
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL.

05:06:37.345 --> 05:06:37.746
PASSED.
