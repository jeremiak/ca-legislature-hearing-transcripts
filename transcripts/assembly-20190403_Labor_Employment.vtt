I STAND THERE ALONG WITH THEM ON

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:25.943
THE BRINK OF HAVING NOTHING. ONE

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.445
DECISION MAKERS SAY THAT I DO

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:29.213
VALUABLE WORK THE LAW SAYS

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.382
SOMETHING ELSE THE LAW SAYS THAT

00:32:31.449 --> 00:32:32.984
I AM DISPOSABLE BECAUSE

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.419
PROVIDERS LIKE ME ARE NOT EVEN

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.953
SEEN WORTHY ENOUGH. TO BE

COVERED BY BASIC WORKER

00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:39.457
PROTECTIONS LIKE A MINIMUM WAGE

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.463
I AM LITERALLY AN ILLNESS AWAY

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.065
FROM LOSING IT ALL.

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:48.966
I AM AN EARLY EDUCATOR IN A

00:32:49.033 --> 00:32:50.335
STATE WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:52.370
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND YET I

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.072
DO NOT EARN A LIVING WAGE.

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:56.808
INSTEAD I QUALIFY FOR THE SAME

00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:58.443

CONSEQUENCES AND THEY DID FOR ME.

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:04.749
IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT UNABLE

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:06.551
TO MAKE MY MORTGAGE I LOST MY

HOME WELL LOSING ONE'S HOME IS

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:10.455
TRAGIC ENOUGH FOR A FAMILY

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:11.656
CHILDCARE PROVIDER.

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:13.124
THE EXPERIENCE IS EVEN MORE

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:14.592
DRAMATIC BECAUSE WHEN WE LOSE

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.761
OUR HOME WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.062
EARN A LIVING.

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:20.031

I MIGHT BE STATING THE OBVIOUS

NOR OBVIOUSLY VERY SYMPATHETIC

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:11.614
TO THE ISSUE OUR CONCERN IS IS

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.982
THAT THIS LEAVE IS SEPARATE AND

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.617
DISTINCT FROM THE COUNTY

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:16.085
CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT SO

01:09:16.151 --> 01:09:17.586
IT APPLIES TO ANY EMPLOYEE WHO

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.854
REACHES NINE HUNDRED HOURS.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.023
OR ABOVE SO WHAT IT DOES IS IN

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.459
ADDITION TO SEE FOR A OR FMLA

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.828
LEAVE AT THE FEDERAL EQUIVALENT

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.229
TO CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.764
IT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:29.598
TWELVE WEEKS OF LEAVE SO WE'RE

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.200
LOOKING AT ANY EMPLOYEE THAT'S

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:33.903
FULL TIME COULD BE TAKING UP TO

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:34.603
TWENTY FOUR WEEKS OF LEAVE

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.804
WITHIN A ONE YEAR PERIOD.

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.373
ADDITIONALLY IF A PART TIME

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.874
EMPLOYEE WORKS NINE HUNDRED

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.276
HOURS RETURNS TO WORK AND THEN

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:41.810
WORKS THE ADDITIONAL THREE

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:42.912
HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS.

01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:44.480
THERE THAN ADDITIONALLY -- I

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:44.980
FEEL THAT THEY ARE THE

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:46.549
ADDITIONAL TWELVE WEEKS ARE ALSO

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:47.883
AVAILABLE TO THEM THE OTHER

01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:49.051
CLARIFICATION THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.286
MAKE IS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.687
FOR PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.188
IT'S NOT JUST FOR FAMILY LEAVE

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:54.523
FOR BABY BONDING.

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.292
IT'S FOR ALL MEDICAL THE FOR A

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.127
FAMILY MEMBER OR YOURSELF SO IT

01:09:58.193 --> 01:09:59.929
EXPANDS THAT TO AN EVEN BROADER

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.764
GROUP OF PEOPLE AND AND THAT'S

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.499
OUR CONCERN IS THAT EMPLOYERS

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:04.733
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.302
DETERMINE WHEN A PERSON CAN OR

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.203
CANNOT TAKE OFF WORK. FOR THESE

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.905
REASONS AND SO THEY CAN'T TELL

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.273
EMPLOYEES SO AND SO'S OUT

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.708
HOWEVER WE CAN LET YOU TAKE

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.410
LEAVE IN SIX WEEKS OR SO AND SO

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:15.411
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MULTIPLE

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.146
EMPLOYEES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:18.514
BE ON LEAVE AT THE SAME TIME.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:19.915
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT ONLY THE

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:21.684
COST OF ALLOWING THOSE EMPLOYEES

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.786
TO TAKE LEAVE -- BUT ALSO THE

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.087
COST OF BACK FILLING THAT

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:26.655
POSITION AND WHILE THIS IS WE

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.157
UNDERSTAND IT'S AN UNPAID LEAVE

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.325
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF THOSE

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:31.427
ISSUES THAT AN EMPLOYER HAS --

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:32.995
TO ACQUIRE -- HAS TO AND MAKE AN

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:35.064
ACCOMMODATION FOR SO OVERALL

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:36.665
THOSE ARE CONCERNS IS THE ADDED

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:37.700
BURDEN THAT THIS WILL PLACE ON

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.201
EMPLOYERS NOTABLY THIS APPLIES

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.003
TO ALL EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE FIFTY

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.805
OR MORE EMPLOYEES.

01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:44.440
AND THAT IS AND YOU KNOW FOR A

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.642
LOT OF EM BUT SMALL BUSINESSES

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:47.843

EMPLOYEES ADDS UP REALLY QUICKLY

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:52.448
SO THAT'S JUST SOMEONE THAT OWNS

01:10:52.514 --> 01:10:54.083

TO ENSURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.998
THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK -- FOR

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.767
SMALLER EMPLOYERS PART TIME OR

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:25.834
FULL TIME STILL DON'T HAVE JOB

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.974
CLASSES OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.408
ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE.

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:36.478
REALLY BASED ON WHO THEY WORK

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.613
FOR HOW THEY WORK UNDER WHAT

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.848
CONDITIONS THEY WORK -- WE HAVE

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.049
OF COURSE TEACHERS WHO DON'T

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:46.989
WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES --

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.573
SMALL PROBLEM WHICH IS IMPORTANT --

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.141
BUT NOT A LARGER ONE I WOULD

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.844
ALSO WONDER IF -- INCOME

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.512
REPLACEMENT ON A PART TIME JOB

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:13.582
THAT IS 60% OR 70%.

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:15.617
OF THEIR INCOME -- IS REALLY FOR

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.119
FILLING RIGHT I MEAN IT'S BETTER

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.021
THAN NOTHING YES -- BUT A LOT OF

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:20.856
PART TIME WORKERS WOULD NOT BE

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:22.624
ABLE TO TAKE THE LEAVE IF THEY

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.960
ONLY RECEIVE 70% OF THEIR INCOME

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:27.696
BECAUSE OFTEN A PART TIME --

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:28.764
ESPECIALLY WITH PARENTS PART

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.666
TIME WORK ON BY MOTHER MIGHT BE

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.936
IN THEY HAVE TO WORK IN ORDER --

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:35.737
TO MAKE THE FAMILY INCOME AND

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:37.573
AND THEY'RE JUGGLING -- CHILD

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:38.707
CARE DUTIES AT HOME AS WELL SO

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.108
I'M JUST CONCERNED OR OTHER

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:41.410
BILLS COMING THROUGH I KNOW THEY

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:41.944
DEAL WITH ALL THE INCOME

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:42.911
REPLACEMENT.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.647
AS WELL AS JOB PROTECTED LEAVE

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:46.815
FOR FOR WORKERS WHO WORK AND AND

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.851
SMALLER COMPANIES AND I THINK I

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.586
AM I I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THIS

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.454
DISCUSSION AND AND HOPEFULLY

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.689
MAYBE EVEN SOME POINT.

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.959
WRAP ALL THESE IN TOGETHER TO

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:57.559
MAKE SURE THAT.

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:58.227
WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE IS A

01:14:58.293 --> 01:14:59.962
LEAVE POLICY THAT COVERS EVERY

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:01.763
WORKER IN CALIFORNIA AND LEE

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.065
POLICY THAT ENSURES THAT YOU CAN

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.700
ACTUALLY TAKE SIX WEEKS OF PAID

01:15:04.766 --> 01:15:05.567
LEAVE BECAUSE?

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:07.402
YOU ARE YOUR INCOME IS REPLACED

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.738
AT A LEVEL THAT THAT FINANCIALLY

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:11.306
THAT'S EVEN FEASIBLE AND THAT

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.708
YOUR JOB WILL BE THERE WHEN YOU

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.276
RETURN SO I I THINK WE'RE AT THE

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.544
SAME WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE SAME

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:15.777
THINGS.

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.446
BUT WE'RE PIECE MEALING AND

01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:19.348
MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.849
I I WOULD AGREE I THINK OUR

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:22.284
INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED -- THAT

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.052
OUR PHILOSOPHIES -- TO SOME

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.654
DEGREE ALLIED AND YOU AND I AS

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:26.655
YOU WELL KNOW ON MANY ISSUES

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.290
DON'T ALIGN OUR PHILOSOPHY IS

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.692
EXACTLY THE SAME AND I CERTAINLY

01:15:30.759 --> 01:15:32.794
BELIEVE IN INCREMENTAL PROGRESS --

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.630
WHETHER IT'S THE PERFECT -- OR

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:37.132
NOT AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:37.733
ROOM IN THE SPACE MEASURE THE

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.167
THE CURRENT MINISTRATION THE

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:40.636
CURRENT GOVERNOR HAS HIS OWN

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:41.737
IDEAS.

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.639
ON THIS SUBJECT THERE'S SEVERAL

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.474
OTHER PIECE LEGISLATION -- I

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.042
WALKED THROUGH THE DEBATE THE

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.944
MERITS OF THOSE IN THIS --

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:50.679
COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME -- BUT I

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.948
DO THINK -- THIS IS A KIND OF

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:55.851
COMMON SENSE REFORM IN THIS BILL

01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:57.619
AND AN INCREMENTAL PROGRESS ON

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.021
THE ISSUE OF MANY OF THOSE

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.289
POPULATIONS YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:03.292
ABOUT THAT DOESN'T BY ANY MEANS --

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:04.960
NEGATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE --

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:06.662
YOU KNOW MORE DRAMATIC OR OR

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:09.965
MORE AMBITIOUS -- UNDERTAKINGS.

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:15.537
AS WELL BUT I DO THINK THAT THAT

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.339
SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE WE'RE TRYING

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.740
TO SOLVE HERE IS IT CRAZY A

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:19.608
LITTLE BIT BETTER EQUITY WITH.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:20.642
PART TIME PLACE AND CONCERNED

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.243
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.110
OUT THERE IN THE WORKFORCE TODAY

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:23.245
THE REMOTE WORKING MULTIPLE PART

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:25.881
TIME JOBS. TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.250
THEN CERTAINLY AS IDENTIFIED IN

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.119
MY OPENING COMMENTS THIS NOTION

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.455
OF NOT RECOGNIZING THAT YOU CAN

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:35.757
HAVE TWO CHILDREN WITH A TWELVE

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:37.659
MONTH PERIOD -- AND

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.795
DISCRIMINATING FRANKLY AGAINST

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.264
INDIVIDUALS A FINDING THAT

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:43.799
CIRCUMSTANCE MAKES NO SENSE AT

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:44.566
AND FINALLY IT JUST A

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:45.167
CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I HEARD

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:46.935
SOMEBODY SAY EMPLOYERS WITH

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:49.738
UNDER FIFTY PEOPLE SO THIS --

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.106
THIS ALLOWS PART TIME WORKERS

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.507
TEMP JOB PROTECTED LEAVE IF

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.409
THEY'RE IT LINES UP WITH FEDERAL

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:55.777
THE FEDERAL STANDARD NOT THE

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:57.079
STATE STANDARD.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.580
BECAUSE IN IN THE STATE IF YOU

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.082
WORK FOR A COMPANY WITH TWENTY

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:01.016
OR LESS.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.351
YOU DON'T HAVE JOB PROTECTIVELY

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:04.453
BUT TWENTY TO FIFTY IS

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.221
PROTECTING CALIFORNIA BUT NOT IN

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.689
THE FEDERAL LAW.

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:09.658

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:12.961
THE BILL IS AT FIFTY TO THE CAN

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:14.496
LOOK AT ALIGNING WITH THE

INCREMENTAL OR SO SO.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:27.876
I I AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN A

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.811

WHAT I DID WE'RE NOT QUITE OKAY

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.352
THE LANGUAGE DOESN'T REFLECT

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:38.987
WHERE WE'RE AT IN OUR

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:40.889

THE INCREMENTAL STEP FORWARD NOT.

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.971

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.822
SAYING IS MAYBE YOU'RE STILL

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:15.123

HOPEFULLY THIS COMES

APPROPRIATIONS.

01:18:21.463 --> 01:18:22.164
THESE ARE THE KIND OF QUESTION

01:39:13.113 --> 01:39:14.515
RETALIATION UNIT.

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:15.749
BUT IT CAN BE SLOW THERE MIGHT

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.518
BE SIX MONTHS WHERE NOTHING

01:39:17.584 --> 01:39:19.353
HAPPENS AT ALL DURING WHICH THEY

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.654
DON'T HAVE A JOB.

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.723
LOOKING AT THE STATS IN TWO

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:23.290

TAKING TIME OFF FOR SAFETY

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:28.796
PLANNING.

01:39:28.862 --> 01:39:30.631

THEY HAD EXPERIENCED RETALIATION

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:33.901
FOR SEEKING SAFETY

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.969

BECAUSE IT ISN'T HAPPENING.

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:40.307
IT'S BECAUSE THE PROCESS CAN BE

01:39:40.374 --> 01:39:41.575
SLOW AND CONFUSING.

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.077
PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:44.845

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:28.215
HOWEVER OUR CONCERN IS MORE

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:30.317
ABOUT THE LEGAL PROCESS AND WHAT

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:32.686

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:43.664
ACTION.

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:44.898
THIS MEANS THAT THE EMPLOYEE CAN

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:46.600
FILE WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.302
AS WELL AS FILE CIVIL ACTION SO

POTENTIALLY PENALIZING THE

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:50.871
EMPLOYER TWICE FOR THE SAME

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.606
ALLEGED VIOLATION IT'S NOT AN

01:41:52.673 --> 01:41:54.975
ALTERNATIVE TO A CIVIL ACTION.

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:56.376
LIKE IT IS UNDER PAGO PAGO

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:58.145
ALLOWS FOR ALL TURN IT OF REMEDY

01:41:58.212 --> 01:41:58.946
IF YOU DON'T FILE WITH THE LABOR

01:41:59.012 --> 01:41:59.780
COMMISSIONER.

ADDITIONALLY AND IT DOES NOT

01:42:01.215 --> 01:42:02.549
EXEMPT RECOVERY UNDER PAGA SO

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:03.917
REALLY THERE ARE THREE AVENUES

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:05.219
FOR RELIEF PAGA.

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.487
THE NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:08.489
THAT THIS WOULD CREATE IN THE

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:09.957
LABOR COMMISSIONER AM.

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:11.525

THE OTHER PROTECTED CATEGORIES.%

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.734
DO YOU HAVE A RIGHT CIVIL ACTION

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:21.869
HOWEVER THEY STILL HAVE TO FILE

01:42:21.935 --> 01:42:23.270
AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY WITH

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:23.770
THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR

01:42:23.837 --> 01:42:25.138
EMPLOYMENT HOUSING SO THERE IS

01:42:25.205 --> 01:42:26.073
AN ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:27.941
REQUIREMENT THAT THIS WOULD SKIP

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:29.676
IN THE LABOR CODE -- INITIALLY

01:42:29.743 --> 01:42:31.178
THE DEAL IS THE WE HAVE ALWAYS

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:35.115
BEEN UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:36.483
THEY ARE CHAMPION FOR EMPLOYEES --

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:37.251
THEY WALK THE EMPLOYEE THROUGH

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:38.452
THE PROCESS LET THEM KNOW OF

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:40.020
THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY PROVIDE

01:42:40.087 --> 01:42:41.522
THE ADVICE FOR THE EMPLOYEE

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:43.557
THEMSELVES ALTERNATELY TURN AND

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:44.358
OF THE CURRENTLY UNDER THE LIFE

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:45.959
THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT WANT TO GO

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:46.793
DOWN THAT ROUTE.

01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:48.061
THEY CANNOT AT THIS TIME FILE

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:50.163
PAGA ACTION AND SO THAT'S WHERE

01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.465
CONCERN IS IS THAT THIS IS

01:42:51.532 --> 01:42:53.200
UNNECESSARY AND DUPLICATIVE

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.902
ADDITIONALLY IN TWO THOUSAND

01:42:54.968 --> 01:42:56.003

02:19:32.597 --> 02:19:34.733
A CONSTITUENT OF MINE HIS NAME

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:36.000
IS ROBERT HE DRIVES FOR LEFT.

02:19:36.067 --> 02:19:39.437
HE WAS ALSO A CONTRACTED WORKER

02:19:39.504 --> 02:19:41.639
WITH FED EX OR THE UNIFORM DROVE

02:19:41.706 --> 02:19:43.842
THE TRUCK DID NOT HAVE THE

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:44.375
BENEFITS THE NOT GET PAID

02:19:44.442 --> 02:19:45.543
OVERTIME.

02:19:45.610 --> 02:19:46.778
THIS IS ALL.

02:19:46.845 --> 02:19:48.046
A VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION

02:19:48.113 --> 02:19:49.547
THE RECENTLY HAPPENED HAPPENS

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.316
BECAUSE I NEEDED A RIDE TO THE

02:19:51.382 --> 02:19:53.118
AIRPORT TO COME TO WORK.

02:19:53.184 --> 02:19:54.419
AND SO CAN THE CONSTITUENT LIVES

02:19:54.486 --> 02:19:56.421
IN MY SAME NEIGHBORHOOD I ASKED

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:59.057
HIM HEY HOW DO YOU LIKE DRIVING

02:19:59.124 --> 02:20:00.258
FOR LIFT.

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:01.059
SAYS WELL I STARTED DRIVING FOR

02:20:01.126 --> 02:20:02.427
LIFT BECAUSE I HAD THIS OTHER

02:20:02.494 --> 02:20:04.095
JOB WHERE I WAS AND HIRE FULL

02:20:04.162 --> 02:20:06.631
TIME HE WAS DRIVING AROUND OUR

02:20:06.698 --> 02:20:08.066
DISTRICT WHICH IS MOSTLY HILLS.

02:20:08.133 --> 02:20:10.034
AND BECAUSE OF THAT HE WASN'T

02:20:10.101 --> 02:20:12.437
ABLE TO MAKE -- HIS DELIVERIES

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:13.605
ON TIME.

02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:16.307
AND SO HE WAS GETTING DOT BY HIS

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:18.009
CONTRACTED EMPLOYER.

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:19.978
AND HE WOULD STAY EXTRA TO MAKE

02:20:20.044 --> 02:20:21.279
HIS DELIVERIES WITHOUT GETTING

02:20:21.346 --> 02:20:22.981
PAID OVERTIME AND I THOUGHT WHAT

02:20:23.047 --> 02:20:24.816
WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM.

02:20:24.883 --> 02:20:25.450
IF SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HIM ON

02:20:25.517 --> 02:20:28.186
THE JOB WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

02:20:28.253 --> 02:20:29.387
FOR HIS WORKERS COMPENSATION.

02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:31.122
NO ANSWER TO THAT.

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:33.725
HE SAID HE FELT JILTED HE WASN'T

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:35.527
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL

02:20:35.593 --> 02:20:36.427
HUMAN BEING.

02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:37.796
AND SO HE STARTED WORKING FOR

02:20:37.862 --> 02:20:38.930
LEFT AND HE LIKED THE

02:20:38.997 --> 02:20:40.632
FLEXIBILITY OF THE HOURS HE

02:20:40.698 --> 02:20:41.833
LIKED THAT HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:43.201
HIS OWN SCHEDULE.

02:20:43.268 --> 02:20:44.836
UNTIL HE HAD AN INCIDENT IN

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:48.840
WHICH HE GOT A OF YOU KNOW WENT

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.275
TO GO PICK SOMEBODY UP A WOMAN

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:52.043
AT A BAR THE COPS WERE THERE

02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:53.912
THERE HAVE BEEN A FIGHT.

02:20:53.978 --> 02:20:56.314
THINGS HAPPEN THAT BARS -- THE

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:58.583
WOMAN UNFORTUNATELY HAVE HAD TOO

02:20:58.650 --> 02:21:00.285
MUCH TO DRINK GOT IN THE CAR HE

02:21:00.351 --> 02:21:02.620
FELT AS HUMAN BEING RESPONSIBLE

02:21:02.687 --> 02:21:03.421
FOR HER.

02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:06.457
HOW DO YOU TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE

02:21:06.524 --> 02:21:07.525
WHO'S INEBRIATED IN THAT STATE?

02:21:07.592 --> 02:21:09.561
TOOK HER TO HER DESTINATION.

02:21:09.627 --> 02:21:10.962
MUCH IS VERY ANGRY AND ASSAULTED

02:21:11.029 --> 02:21:12.096
HIM.

02:21:12.163 --> 02:21:13.865
STARTED HITTING HIM.

02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:15.333
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:16.768
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE GOT TO HER

02:21:16.835 --> 02:21:19.437
PLACE SAFE -- I DON'T THINK THAT

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:20.538
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:22.407
SITUATION FOR HER HAD BEEN

02:21:22.473 --> 02:21:23.308
SOMEONE ELSE WITH LESS.

02:21:23.374 --> 02:21:28.246
MORALS -- LIFT APPARENTLY HAS --

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:29.681
AN EMERGENCY NUMBER THAT YOU

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:31.549
CALL AS A DRIVER AND HE CALLED

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:32.951
IT TO FILE.

02:21:33.017 --> 02:21:34.752
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM?

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:36.955
AND NO ONE PICKED UP.

02:21:37.021 --> 02:21:37.522
THERE WASN'T ANYBODY ON THE

02:21:37.589 --> 02:21:39.357
OTHER END.

02:21:39.424 --> 02:21:40.925
AND THE ONLY THING THAT HE COULD

02:21:40.992 --> 02:21:43.561
DO WAS GIVE HER A LOW RATING.

02:21:43.628 --> 02:21:44.896
AND THEN WRITE A COMMENT.

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:46.831
THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED IN

02:21:46.898 --> 02:21:48.399
THIS PARTICULAR RIDE.

02:21:48.466 --> 02:21:50.068
HE DID GET A CALL BACK UNTIL THE

02:21:50.134 --> 02:21:52.604
FOLLOWING DAY HOURS LATER.

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:56.074
IN WHICH HE SHARED THAT -- THE

02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:56.875
PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE

02:21:56.941 --> 02:21:59.677
LINE SAID WELL ARE YOU OKAY.

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:00.645
HE SAID YOUNG FINE BUT THAT'S

02:22:00.712 --> 02:22:02.614
NOT.

02:22:02.680 --> 02:22:04.549
WHY I'M CALLING OUR WAY CALLED?

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:05.116
AND THAT HE FELT INCREDIBLY

02:22:05.183 --> 02:22:06.050
ALONE.

02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:07.952
WHAT IF SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN?

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:09.053
WHAT IF IT WOULD HAVE GONE A

02:22:09.120 --> 02:22:10.388
DIFFERENT DIRECTION?

02:22:10.455 --> 02:22:13.992
WHAT WERE HIS RIGHTS AS A WORKER?

02:22:14.058 --> 02:22:14.592
AND SO I TOLD THEM -- WE'RE

02:22:14.659 --> 02:22:15.994
DOING THIS SMALL LITTLE THING

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:18.830
CALLED AB -- FIVE AND HE SAID I

02:22:18.897 --> 02:22:20.331
WANT TO KNOW MORE.

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:22.400
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A JOB THAT I

02:22:22.467 --> 02:22:23.902
THOUGHT THAT I WOULD HAVE.

02:22:23.968 --> 02:22:25.003
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M

02:22:25.069 --> 02:22:26.671
ABLE TO PAY MY RENT TO PUT FOOD

02:22:26.738 --> 02:22:27.972
ON THE TABLE BUT I ALSO WANT TO

02:22:28.039 --> 02:22:29.540
FEEL SAFE.

02:22:29.607 --> 02:22:31.509
AND I THINK THAT THERE IS YES

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:33.444
THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN

02:22:33.511 --> 02:22:35.280
SCHEDULES OR IS IT SOMETHING

02:22:35.346 --> 02:22:37.548
VERY IMPORTANT TO BE SAID ABOUT.

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:38.116
BEING ABLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN

02:22:38.182 --> 02:22:39.050
SCHEDULE.

02:22:39.117 --> 02:22:40.618
DEPENDING ON WHAT IT IS THAT YOU

02:22:40.685 --> 02:22:42.053
NEED TO DO IN YOUR LIFE.

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:43.621
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM

02:22:43.688 --> 02:22:45.290
FIVE YEARS AGO SO WE ARE IN A

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:48.026
NEW AGE A NEW ECONOMY.

02:22:48.092 --> 02:22:49.594
IN WHICH WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:22:49.661 --> 02:22:51.763
RIGHT NOW TO DEFINE WHAT THE

02:22:51.829 --> 02:22:52.730
RIGHTS OF WORKERS ARE FOR THE

02:22:52.797 --> 02:22:53.998
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:22:54.065 --> 02:22:55.433
HOPEFULLY SET A TONE FOR THE

02:22:55.500 --> 02:22:57.268
NATION BECAUSE SURE.

02:22:57.335 --> 02:22:59.037
WE LOVE INNOVATION WE WANT TO

02:22:59.103 --> 02:23:00.505
USE TECHNOLOGY WE WANT TO USE

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:01.940
THESE APPS THAT MAKE OUR LIVES

02:23:02.006 --> 02:23:02.907
EASIER.

02:23:02.974 --> 02:23:04.042
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE AT THE COST

02:23:04.108 --> 02:23:06.678
AND WELL BEING OF WORKERS WHO

02:23:06.744 --> 02:23:09.047
DESERVE TO HAVE A LIVING WAGE TO

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:10.515
HAVE BENEFITS TO HAVE A RIGHT TO

02:23:10.581 --> 02:23:12.450
JOIN A UNION IF THAT'S WHAT THEY

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:13.284
SO CHOOSE TO DO.

02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:14.218
BUT ALSO SHOULDN'T FEEL

02:23:14.285 --> 02:23:15.820
DISCRIMINATED IF THEY ARE

02:23:15.887 --> 02:23:17.388
WORKING IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE

02:23:17.455 --> 02:23:18.623
THEY KNOW THAT OTHER WORKERS ARE

02:23:18.690 --> 02:23:20.525
FULLY EMPLOYED WITH BENEFITS

02:23:20.591 --> 02:23:21.926
WHILE THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE

02:23:21.993 --> 02:23:23.227
THOSE THINGS IT CREATES A

02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:24.362
DIVISION.

02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:25.863
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT

02:23:25.930 --> 02:23:27.265
SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT

02:23:27.332 --> 02:23:29.133
TESTIMONY ON HIS BEHALF BECAUSE

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:30.535
IT COMES DIRECTLY FROM MY

02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:31.669
DISTRICT.

02:23:31.736 --> 02:23:33.972
AND IT SHOWED ME THE REAL

02:23:34.038 --> 02:23:35.606
IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT IT TRULY

02:23:35.673 --> 02:23:37.241
MEANS AND WHAT HE IS TRYING TO

02:23:37.308 --> 02:23:39.143
DO AND LIVE HIS LIFE.

02:23:39.210 --> 02:23:40.044
SO THANK YOU.

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:42.613
THANK YOU THAT IS A QUESTION OF

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:44.082
FOR THE AUTHOR AND YOUR YOUR

02:23:44.148 --> 02:23:45.717
WITNESS -- COULD CERTAINLY

02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:48.720
ANSWER I IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY --

02:23:48.786 --> 02:23:49.754
I THINK THAT THERE IS OFTENTIMES

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:53.958
MENTIONED THAT BUT THIS BILL

02:23:54.025 --> 02:23:56.627
FLEXIBILITY IS LOST OR STATUS

02:23:56.694 --> 02:23:58.196
CHANGES BOX BUT HE CAN YOU

02:23:58.262 --> 02:23:58.596
ANSWER A TO THAT.

02:23:58.663 --> 02:24:00.598
FLEXIBILITY IS A 100% AND THE

02:24:00.665 --> 02:24:02.600
CONTROL OF THE EMPLOYER -- AND

02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:04.769
SO WHETHER AN EMPLOYER CHOOSES

02:24:04.836 --> 02:24:07.505
TO ALLOW WORKERS FLEXIBILITY --

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:09.507
AS LIFTING OVER CURRENTLY DO ARE

02:24:09.574 --> 02:24:11.743
ON ON THEIR PLATFORMS WOULD BE

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:14.145
THE SAME IF THEY WERE EMPLOYEES

02:24:14.212 --> 02:24:15.613
THE WORKERS THEMSELVES IT WOULD

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.317
BE UP TO UBER OR LEFT -- TO TO

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:21.586
DECIDE IF THEY GAVE WORKERS THAT

02:24:21.652 --> 02:24:23.121
FLEXIBILITY OR NOT -- THE

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:24.355
DIFFERENCE WOULD BE OF COURSE

02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:25.990
THOSE WORKERS COULD COME

02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:29.427
TOGETHER -- AND AND I HAVE A

02:24:29.494 --> 02:24:30.762
COLLECTIVE VOICE.

02:24:30.828 --> 02:24:32.730
WITH THEIR EMPLOYER ABOUT THAT

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:34.665
DESIRE FOR FLEXIBILITY SOMETHING

02:24:34.732 --> 02:24:38.002
THAT RIGHT NOW IS IS.

02:24:38.069 --> 02:24:39.670
ALTHOUGH HAPPENS.

02:24:39.737 --> 02:24:41.272
AND OFFICIALLY IT IS REALLY

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:42.673
BARRED BY FEDERAL LAW.

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:44.575
OF AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S

02:24:44.642 --> 02:24:45.910
REALLY IMPORTANT AYE AYE A

02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:46.978
EVERYBODY THAT SAYS THEY WANT

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:49.213
FLEXIBILITY WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.782
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY.

02:24:50.848 --> 02:24:54.085
IN THE HANDS OF OF LIFT AND UBER

02:24:54.152 --> 02:24:55.153
AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:56.254
FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:57.388
THIS BILL DOESN'T TAKE AWAY

02:24:57.455 --> 02:24:58.689
FLEXIBILITY.

02:24:58.756 --> 02:24:59.524
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE LABOR

02:24:59.590 --> 02:25:00.958
CODE OR AN EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER

02:25:01.025 --> 02:25:03.561
RELATIONSHIPS -- THAT DETERMINE

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:04.862
WHETHER OR NOT AN EMPLOYER IS

02:25:04.929 --> 02:25:08.299
FLEXIBLE IN THIS BILL DOES NOT

02:25:08.366 --> 02:25:08.833
CHANGE THAT THIS PLEASE.

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:10.201
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:11.702
MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:13.404
ADD ON BEHALF OF MY OF ONE OF

02:25:13.471 --> 02:25:14.505
THE WITNESSES THAT WAS SITTING

02:25:14.572 --> 02:25:15.873
UP HERE EARLIER AND DID NOT GET

02:25:15.940 --> 02:25:18.910
A CHANCE TO TESTIFY -- HE SPOKE

02:25:18.976 --> 02:25:20.778
ABOUT HIS OWN LIMOUSINE SERVICE

02:25:20.845 --> 02:25:22.914
COMPANY AND SAID THEY HAVE THE

02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:25.083
EMPLOYMENT MODEL THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:25:25.149 --> 02:25:27.118
ARE ALLOWED TO DECLINE JOBS

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:28.386
THAT'S PART OF THE WAY THEY RUN

02:25:28.453 --> 02:25:29.921
THAT BUSINESS IT IS AN ON DEMAND

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:30.822
BUSINESS.

02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:31.989
AND SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT

02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:33.458
KIND OF FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE

02:25:33.524 --> 02:25:36.027
TO HAVE DRIVERS AVAILABLE TO BE

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:36.861
ABLE TO HAVE DRIVERS WILLING TO

02:25:36.928 --> 02:25:38.496
KIND OF GO WITH THE SUPPLY AND

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:40.898
DEMAND OF THE WORK AND SO

02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:42.100
THERE'S NO REASON AN EMPLOYER.

02:25:42.166 --> 02:25:44.435
CAN'T OFFER AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY

02:25:44.502 --> 02:25:46.204
AS THEY WANT AND IN FACT MANY

02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:48.339
MANY EMPLOYERS CHOOSE TO DO THAT

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:49.874
WHILE STILL PROVIDING THAT

02:25:49.941 --> 02:25:50.908
SAFETY THAT FOR THEIR WORK AND I

02:25:50.975 --> 02:25:52.710
DIDN'T HINDER HIS ABILITY TO BE

02:25:52.777 --> 02:25:55.480
FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF OPENING

02:25:55.546 --> 02:25:57.248
LIMOUSINE SERVICE.

02:25:57.315 --> 02:25:58.249
AND QUITE FRANKLY -- TO LET

02:25:58.316 --> 02:25:59.217
LET'S POINT OUT THAT -- THERE IS

02:25:59.283 --> 02:26:01.119
FLEXIBILITY NOW BECAUSE OF THE

02:26:01.185 --> 02:26:03.121
SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE ON THE

02:26:03.187 --> 02:26:05.056
FLEXIBILITY ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:06.891
PEOPLE WANT A RIDE THAT'S THE

02:26:06.958 --> 02:26:08.392
SAME THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF

02:26:08.459 --> 02:26:10.661
THEY WERE AN EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER.

02:26:10.728 --> 02:26:13.965
PEOPLE WOULD BE TO RIDE AND IF

02:26:14.031 --> 02:26:14.999
THAT WAS AVAILABLE THAT THEY

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:17.902
PLOY E. COULD WORK -- IF NOBODY

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:19.470
WANTED TO RIDE WITH IN THIS

02:26:19.537 --> 02:26:21.172
PLATFORM THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY

02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:22.840
BECAUSE YOU REALLY CAN'T WORK IF

02:26:22.907 --> 02:26:24.675
NOBODY NEEDS A RIDE LIKE WISE

02:26:24.742 --> 02:26:26.444
THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO HAPPEN.

02:26:26.511 --> 02:26:28.746
THANK YOU UP I HAVE SOME

02:26:28.813 --> 02:26:29.547

IF THEY DO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:34.619
COMMENTS.

02:26:34.685 --> 02:26:36.120
OKAY WELL I JUST WANTED TO THANK

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:40.591
MAN OPPOSITION.

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:42.460
THERE'S BEEN A LOT.

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:44.328
UNDERSTANDABLY CONVERSATION

02:26:44.395 --> 02:26:45.763

02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:49.634
ON THIS ISSUE -- AS INDICATED BY

02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:51.736
THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS IN -- THE

02:26:51.802 --> 02:26:54.639
STAFF ANALYSIS UP THIS BILL IS

02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:56.674
CAUGHT UP BY EXISTING LAW BASED

02:26:56.741 --> 02:26:58.543
UPON THE SUPREME COURT DECISION.

02:26:58.609 --> 02:27:00.811
IF NOTHING IS DONE THAT IS THE

02:27:00.878 --> 02:27:02.113
LAW AND IT STANDS.

02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:04.615
AND SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:07.585
GREAT INTEREST FROM EMPLOYERS

02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:09.453

ORGANIZATIONS.

02:31:57.141 --> 02:31:58.375
MAYBE THERE'S GET SOMETHING LOST

02:31:58.442 --> 02:31:59.977
IN THE TRANSLATION WHEN WHEN

TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO BE

02:32:08.385 --> 02:32:09.353
REALLY CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.721
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS --

02:32:10.788 --> 02:32:13.157
NOBODY IS TAKING PART BE OUT SO

02:32:13.224 --> 02:32:14.692
PART B. IS ESSENTIAL TO THE

02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:16.494
DYNAMICS DECISION AND IT IS IT

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.194
IS.

02:32:17.261 --> 02:32:19.163
THAT THE MIDDLE PART OF A TEST

02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:23.133
SO -- SO IT TO BELIEVE AT LEAST

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:25.102
IN THIS BILL.

02:32:25.169 --> 02:32:26.270
THE ONE I'M CARING AND PART B.

WILL NOT BE TAKEN OUT SO I I

02:32:28.539 --> 02:32:29.406
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE

02:32:29.473 --> 02:32:30.774
THAT'S NOT EVEN IN NEGOTIATED

02:32:30.841 --> 02:32:33.377
STANDPOINT WHAT WE'VE DONE ON

02:32:33.444 --> 02:32:35.279
EXEMPTIONS IS THIS.

02:32:35.346 --> 02:32:37.848

HAD CERTAIN ASPECTS THAT MADE

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:43.254
THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO ORDER%

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:44.788
IN THE LABOR CODE.

02:32:44.855 --> 02:32:46.056
THINGS LIKE THE BILL EIGHTY TO

02:32:46.123 --> 02:32:47.558
SOUTH NEGOTIATE RIGHT THERE

02:32:47.625 --> 02:32:49.660
SETTING THEIR OWN RATES THEY

02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:51.929
HAVE THEIR OWN STRUCTURE -- THEY

02:32:51.996 --> 02:32:54.465
THEY ARE WORKERS FIND FAR THAT

02:32:54.532 --> 02:32:56.934
SATISFY OUR TEST FOR FOR

02:32:57.001 --> 02:32:58.402

02:33:10.881 --> 02:33:12.816
THESE FEATURES -- THEY HAVE THE

02:33:12.883 --> 02:33:14.451
ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FOR

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:16.320
THEMSELVES THEIR RATES ARE NOT

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:17.855
FAT I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:33:17.922 --> 02:33:19.657
IMPORTANT -- WHEN RATES ARE SET

02:33:19.723 --> 02:33:22.026
BY A MASTER CONTRACTOR THAT

02:33:22.092 --> 02:33:23.227
MEANS YOU'RE WORKING FOR

02:33:23.294 --> 02:33:26.297
SOMEBODY -- FOR THE MOST PART IN

02:33:26.363 --> 02:33:27.598

ALL THE WORKERS BECAUSE I DON'T

02:33:30.134 --> 02:33:31.402
THINK THIS IS UNDERSTOOD. FOR

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:32.236
EXAMPLE WE COULD LOOK AT

02:33:32.303 --> 02:33:36.006
COSMETOLOGY AND THAT'S AN ISSUE

02:33:36.073 --> 02:33:36.840
THAT WE'RE GOING.

02:33:36.907 --> 02:33:38.275
TO WORK ON IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS

02:33:38.342 --> 02:33:40.244
WITH -- HAIR STYLISTS IN AND

02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:40.911
NAIL SALON OWNERS AND THERE IS A

02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:41.845
DIFFERENCE AND WE ALL KNOW THIS

02:33:41.912 --> 02:33:44.214
IF YOU GO TO YOUR YOUR YOUR HAIR

02:33:44.281 --> 02:33:45.716

THERE'S NOT RATES ON THE ON ON

02:33:50.921 --> 02:33:52.423
THE WALL THAT TELL YOU HOW MUCH

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:54.091
THEY'RE CHARGING THAT MEANS ARE

02:33:54.158 --> 02:33:55.259
WORKING FOR THEMSELVES VERY

02:33:55.326 --> 02:33:56.660
SMALL BUSINESS THEY'RE

02:33:56.727 --> 02:33:58.162
NEGOTIATING WITH YOU.

02:33:58.228 --> 02:33:59.663
IF I'M WORKING FOR A COMPANY

02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:01.599
WHERE EVERY HAIR CUT IS SEVEN

02:34:01.665 --> 02:34:02.700
DOLLARS AND THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

02:34:02.766 --> 02:34:04.301
SOUTH DECIDED AND THERE'S

02:34:04.368 --> 02:34:06.270
SOMEBODY ELSE DECIDING WHEN I AM

02:34:06.337 --> 02:34:07.905
I'M GOING TO SCHEDULE YOU AND

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:09.139
HOW OFTEN I'M THERE.

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:10.541
THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN INDEPENDENT

02:34:10.608 --> 02:34:12.610
CONTRACTOR THAT DOESN'T FOUNDER

02:34:12.676 --> 02:34:15.179
FEEL LIKE A SMALL BUSINESS AND I

02:34:15.245 --> 02:34:15.779
I WANT PEOPLE TO REALLY THINK

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:17.615
THROUGH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:19.249
HERE WE'RE TRYING TO ENSURE.

02:34:19.316 --> 02:34:20.751
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE INDEPENDENT

02:34:20.818 --> 02:34:23.020
CONTRACTORS UNDERSTAND IN KNOLL

02:34:23.087 --> 02:34:24.021
NOT JUST THAT THEY HAVE

02:34:24.088 --> 02:34:25.422
FLEXIBILITY BUT THEY HAVE

02:34:25.489 --> 02:34:29.593

TAKING TOO MUCH TIME BUT THIS IS

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:44.975
FOR ME SUCH AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE.

02:34:45.042 --> 02:34:47.011
I WAS IN THAT THE CHAIRS I

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:48.646

SIXTY HOURS A WEEK WHICH IS A

02:35:20.811 --> 02:35:23.681
LOT OF WORK -- THAT HE COULD OF

MAKEUP CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND

02:35:26.083 --> 02:35:27.851

HE SAID OVER THE TIME PERIOD

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:37.161
WHAT HE SAW IS THAT ABILITY TO

02:35:37.227 --> 02:35:38.529
MAKE THAT MONEY WENT DOWN AND

02:35:38.595 --> 02:35:39.763
DOWN AND DOWN.

02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:41.965
AS THESE TWO COMPANIES BATTLED

02:35:42.032 --> 02:35:44.368
AND THAT HE IS NOW -- BRINGING

02:35:44.435 --> 02:35:46.537

02:35:46.603 --> 02:35:48.672
WEEK WORKING SIXTY HOURS A WEEK

02:35:48.739 --> 02:35:50.274
AND SAN JOSE WHICH IS HIGH A

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:51.241
COST LIVING.

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:53.177
BEFORE TAXES AND THEN HE HAS TO

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:54.778
FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY HIS TAXES

02:35:54.845 --> 02:35:56.680
HE HAS NO HEALTH INSURANCE IT IS

02:35:56.747 --> 02:35:58.682
CHILDREN ARE NOT INSURED -- HE

02:35:58.749 --> 02:36:02.152
HE HAS NO SAFETY NET IF HE GETS

02:36:02.219 --> 02:36:03.987
HURT ON THE JOB HE DOESN'T HAVE

02:36:04.054 --> 02:36:05.622
WORKERS COMPENSATION HE HAS NO

02:36:05.689 --> 02:36:07.257
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IT IF

02:36:07.324 --> 02:36:09.860
SOMEHOW HE HE LOSES THAT JOB.

02:36:09.927 --> 02:36:11.295
AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE

02:36:11.361 --> 02:36:16.100
FEAR THE FEAR OF OF UBER OR LIFT

02:36:16.166 --> 02:36:18.035
OR ANY TECH COMPANY AFTER BASED

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:20.237
COMPANY OF OF RETALIATING

02:36:20.304 --> 02:36:21.972
AGAINST HIS ABILITY TO EARN

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:24.475
MONEY THROUGH THAT PLATFORM

02:36:24.541 --> 02:36:25.642
WITHOUT EXPLANATION.

02:36:25.709 --> 02:36:26.410
THEY CAN DROP A DRIVER WITHOUT

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:28.879
EXPLANATION IN WHICH CASE HE IS

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:30.914
STILL A FATHER OF FOUR KIDS.

02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:32.983
LIVING IN SAN JOSE WITHOUT

02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:34.184
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND

02:36:34.251 --> 02:36:36.153
WITHOUT HIS ABILITY TO EVEN MAKE

02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:36.987
A CAR PAYMENT.

02:36:37.054 --> 02:36:39.523
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:41.625
THAT -- YOU KNOW IT WE SAW A LOT

02:36:41.692 --> 02:36:42.893

BECAUSE IT THE DAY THIS MAN TOLD

02:36:44.595 --> 02:36:46.029
METHE STORY.

02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:47.297
THE DAY THE MAN TOLD ME THE

02:36:47.364 --> 02:36:50.400
STORY WAS THE SAME DATE WE SAW

02:36:50.467 --> 02:36:52.202
LIVE CELEBRATE BECOMING.

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:54.204
AT A COMPANY VALUED AT TWENTY

02:36:54.271 --> 02:36:56.373
BILLION DOLLARS BILLION WITH A

02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:58.275
B..

02:36:58.342 --> 02:36:59.510
THAT HIGH THAT'S A INNOVATION

02:36:59.576 --> 02:37:01.879
THAT'S GREAT BUT IF YOU'RE A

02:37:01.945 --> 02:37:02.746
TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

02:37:02.813 --> 02:37:04.448
COMPANY IN YOU GET ON TELEVISION

02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:06.250

YOU HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS THAT

02:37:15.459 --> 02:37:16.894
EVERY OTHER COMPANY IN

02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:18.362
CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO DO.

02:37:18.428 --> 02:37:20.564
THAT YOU CANNOT SURVIVE IN THE

02:37:20.631 --> 02:37:22.566
MARKETPLACE I WOULD VENTURE TO

02:37:22.633 --> 02:37:25.435
SAY THIS IS NOT HOW CAPITALISM

02:37:25.502 --> 02:37:27.171
IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.

02:37:27.237 --> 02:37:29.439
THAT IS THEN EITHER FAKE VALUE

02:37:29.506 --> 02:37:31.275
OF A COMPANY AND MEANS A LOT OF

02:37:31.341 --> 02:37:32.176
PEOPLE GET RIPPED OFF WITH STOCK

02:37:32.242 --> 02:37:33.977
OR THEY HAVE A REALLY BAD

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:35.345
BUSINESS MODEL THAT THEY CAN'T

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:36.280
EVEN PLAY THEIR WORKERS BUT

02:37:36.346 --> 02:37:37.881
SOMEHOW THEY CAN PAY.

GIVEN FIRST OF ALL THAT IT

02:51:10.193 --> 02:51:11.294

STALKING HOWEVER.

02:51:23.606 --> 02:51:25.575
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OCCURS OFTEN

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:28.011
TIME IN THE WORKPLACE -- AND IT

02:51:28.077 --> 02:51:29.045
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS

02:51:29.112 --> 02:51:30.580
DETERMINED BY THE POLICE IT'S

02:51:30.647 --> 02:51:32.248
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED.

02:51:32.315 --> 02:51:34.317
BY THE CRIMINAL DEPARTMENT IT IS

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:36.019

UNLAWFUL BEHAVIOR.

02:51:45.061 --> 02:51:46.829
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

02:51:46.896 --> 02:51:47.997
THERE ARE A LOT OF BEHAVIOR THAT

02:51:48.064 --> 02:51:50.033
CAN BE INAPPROPRIATE ANY SORT OF

02:51:50.099 --> 02:51:52.301
HARASSMENT IS OBVIOUSLY --

02:51:52.368 --> 02:51:54.003
SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED HOWEVER

02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:55.705
IT'S NOT ALWAYS UNLAWFUL AND

02:51:55.772 --> 02:51:56.539
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SIMPLY

02:51:56.606 --> 02:51:59.042
PULLS PARTS OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT

02:51:59.108 --> 02:52:00.376
COULD RISE TO THE LEVEL SEXUAL

02:52:00.443 --> 02:52:01.077
HARASSMENT.

02:52:01.144 --> 02:52:02.278
BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THEY

02:52:02.345 --> 02:52:04.347
ACTUALLY WRITES THE SEVERE OR

02:52:04.414 --> 02:52:05.782
PERVASIVE STANDARD EXAMPLE

LEERING IS INAPPROPRIATE

02:52:09.185 --> 02:52:09.652
BEHAVIOR BUT THAT DOESN'T

02:52:09.719 --> 02:52:11.354
ACTUALLY MEAN THAT IT'S UNLAWFUL

02:52:11.421 --> 02:52:13.222
BEHAVIOR THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL

02:52:13.289 --> 02:52:14.991
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IT CAN.

02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:15.958
BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

02:52:16.025 --> 02:52:17.060
THAT IT DOES THIS BILL WOULD

02:52:17.126 --> 02:52:19.028
ALLOW HIM AN INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE

EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME OF LEAVE

02:52:29.472 --> 02:52:31.007
BECAUSE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT

02:52:31.074 --> 02:52:32.275
THAT THERE BE ANY VERIFICATION

02:52:32.341 --> 02:52:33.609

SORT OF VERIFICATION.

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.763
THE DEFINITION OF FAMILY MEMBERS

02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:55.765
EXTREMELY BROAD AND GIVEN THE

02:52:55.832 --> 02:52:56.966
WAY THAT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY

02:52:57.033 --> 02:52:58.334
WRITTEN IT BY EXAMPLE WOULD

02:52:58.401 --> 02:53:00.169
ALLOW ME TO TELL MY BROTHER WHO

02:53:00.236 --> 02:53:02.205

02:53:02.271 --> 02:53:03.272

UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT THE

02:53:12.148 --> 02:53:16.886
INTENT OF THE AUTHOR HOWEVER

02:53:16.953 --> 02:53:17.487
THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE BILL'S

02:53:17.553 --> 02:53:19.288
CURRENT DRAFTED AND THAT'S OUR

02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:19.922
CONCERN SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

02:53:19.989 --> 02:53:20.523
JUST SO DIFFERENT AGAIN IT'S

02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:21.157
REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:53:21.224 --> 02:53:21.691
FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING.

02:53:21.758 --> 02:53:22.258
THIS NOW PLACES IT INTO THE

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:24.060
LABOR CODE AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:25.728
CONCERNS WITH THAT ISSUE

02:53:25.795 --> 02:53:27.230
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT

02:53:27.296 --> 02:53:28.097
THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:53:28.164 --> 02:53:29.432
REMEDY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:53:29.499 --> 02:53:30.399

WHO HELPED TO WEED OUT CLAIMS

02:53:32.368 --> 02:53:33.803
THAT ARE FRIVOLOUS AND THERE

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:35.204
WOULD BE NO SUCH DEPARTMENT

02:53:35.271 --> 02:53:36.405
DOING THAT AS FAR AS

02:53:36.472 --> 02:53:37.640
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDY?

02:53:37.707 --> 02:53:39.375
AND OUR CONCERNS ARE JUST THE

02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:40.543
OVERALL ABUSE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:43.212
WAY TO VERIFY OR ALLOW ANYONE TO

02:53:43.279 --> 02:53:45.181
TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:45.515
IT THANK YOU.

02:53:45.581 --> 02:53:47.617

02:54:06.736 --> 02:54:08.971
THE CONCERNS REYES FOR EXAMPLE

02:54:09.038 --> 02:54:09.906

OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT CONTAINED

02:54:11.941 --> 02:54:13.276

THE DISINCENTIVE IS ATION FROM

03:07:27.002 --> 03:07:28.403
THIS BILL COMES FROM THE FACT

03:07:28.470 --> 03:07:29.605
THAT NOT ONLY IMPOSE A CIVIL

03:07:29.671 --> 03:07:31.273

PLAN AND ADDITIONALLY IT

03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:42.417
PROHIBITS EMPLOYERS FROM

PROGRAM AND FOR EXAMPLE LET'S

03:07:50.826 --> 03:07:52.694
SAY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS HARASSING

03:07:52.761 --> 03:07:54.563
SOMEONE THAT CAME IN TO PROVIDE

REGARDING THE WELLNESS PROGRAM.

03:07:58.133 --> 03:07:58.767
THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE NO

ABILITY TO TAKE ANY ADVERSE

EMPLOYMENT ACTION AGAINST THAT

03:08:01.803 --> 03:08:03.639
EMPLOYEE BECAUSE IT'S RELATED TO

03:08:03.705 --> 03:08:05.407
A MATTER REGARDING WELLNESS AND

03:08:05.474 --> 03:08:06.742
THOSE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL

ADDITIONALLY AT THE THE MANDATES

03:08:13.548 --> 03:08:14.616
AND THREATS OF LIABILITY BOTH

03:08:14.683 --> 03:08:15.250
CRIMINAL AND CIVIL WILL SIMPLY

03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:16.251
ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR

MITCH DYER WITH THE CALIFORNIA

LABOR FEDERATION PROUD TO CO

03:12:20.996 --> 03:12:22.497
SPONSOR THIS BILL TO BETTER

03:12:22.564 --> 03:12:24.399
PROTECT OUTDOOR WORKERS FROM

03:12:24.466 --> 03:12:25.800
EXPOSURE TO WILD FIRE SMOKE.

03:12:25.867 --> 03:12:27.035
AS MOST OF US IN CALIFORNIA --

03:12:27.102 --> 03:12:28.904
PAINFULLY AWARE THIS IS A HAZARD

03:12:28.970 --> 03:12:31.006
THAT GETS WORSE EVERY YEAR --

03:12:31.072 --> 03:12:31.873
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IF YOU

03:12:31.940 --> 03:12:32.807
HAVE TO WORK OUTSIDE THESE

03:12:32.874 --> 03:12:34.075
ENVIRONMENTS OF SOMETHING THAT

03:12:34.142 --> 03:12:35.377
YOU'RE REALLY FAMILIAR WITH WE

03:12:35.443 --> 03:12:36.978
SAW HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN

03:12:37.045 --> 03:12:38.013
LAST YEAR

03:12:38.079 --> 03:12:39.281
WHERE WORKERS WERE FORCED TO

03:12:39.347 --> 03:12:40.715
WORK OUTSIDE WITH NOTHING NO

03:12:40.782 --> 03:12:42.484
MASKS NO RESPIRATORS NO NOTHING

03:12:42.550 --> 03:12:43.351
AND?

03:12:43.418 --> 03:12:44.819
IT IT GOES A LOT BECAUSE PRETTY

03:12:44.886 --> 03:12:46.288
FAR BEYOND JUST DAMAGING YOUR

03:12:46.354 --> 03:12:47.422
THROAT MAKING A LITTLE BIT

03:12:47.489 --> 03:12:49.057
HARDER TO BREATHE IT DOES

03:12:49.124 --> 03:12:49.824
PERMANENT DAMAGE TO YOUR LONG

03:12:49.891 --> 03:12:52.193
FUNCTION WE ALL INHALED A LOT OF

03:12:52.260 --> 03:12:53.428
DIFFERENT CARCINOGENS SO ON

03:12:53.495 --> 03:12:54.529
THERE'S A LOT OF PERMANENT

03:12:54.596 --> 03:12:55.864
DAMAGE DONE AND THAT'S JUST FROM.

03:12:55.931 --> 03:12:57.399
WALKING AROUND IF YOU HAVE TO

03:12:57.465 --> 03:12:58.800
WORK IN THIS KIND OF AIR YOUR

03:12:58.867 --> 03:13:00.035
SPENDING EIGHT HOURS EXERTING

03:13:00.101 --> 03:13:01.803
YOURSELF ON THE DAMAGE IS FAR

03:13:01.870 --> 03:13:02.737
WORSE.

03:13:02.804 --> 03:13:04.406
AND SO WE DO HAVE EXISTING

03:13:04.472 --> 03:13:06.341
REGULATIONS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

03:13:06.408 --> 03:13:07.042
PROTECT WORKERS FROM THIS HAZARD

03:13:07.108 --> 03:13:09.077
BUT THEY KIND OF SPANISH RANGE

03:13:09.144 --> 03:13:10.912
FROM EITHER SO VAGUE THAT NO ONE

03:13:10.979 --> 03:13:11.646
REALLY KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH

03:13:11.713 --> 03:13:13.648
THEM TOO SO CUMBERSOME THAT

03:13:13.715 --> 03:13:14.516
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF IGNORES

03:13:14.582 --> 03:13:15.050
THEM.

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:16.785
AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

03:13:16.851 --> 03:13:18.286
IT IS PETITION THE STANDARDS

03:13:18.353 --> 03:13:19.821
BOARD TO COME UP WITH NEW

03:13:19.888 --> 03:13:21.489
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT DO A

03:13:21.556 --> 03:13:23.158
BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING WORKERS.

03:13:23.224 --> 03:13:24.459
THAT PROCESS IS HAPPENING AND

03:13:24.526 --> 03:13:25.760
IT'S GOING PRETTY WELL BUT WE

03:13:25.827 --> 03:13:27.295
BELIEVE WE NEED A BILL TO KIND

03:13:27.362 --> 03:13:28.997
OF GUIDE THE PROCESS IN A FEW

03:13:29.064 --> 03:13:30.598
DIFFERENT WAYS ONE REASON IS

03:13:30.665 --> 03:13:32.100
THAT WE WANT TO CLARIFY THE

03:13:32.167 --> 03:13:33.635
THRESHOLD WHEN EMPLOYER ACTION

03:13:33.702 --> 03:13:34.803
IS NECESSARY.

03:13:34.869 --> 03:13:36.538
RIGHT NOW THE LAW SAYS THAT

03:13:36.604 --> 03:13:38.073
BASICALLY EMPLOYERS ARE SUPPOSED

03:13:38.139 --> 03:13:39.040
TO DO SOMETHING WHEN THERE'S A

03:13:39.107 --> 03:13:40.542
HARMFUL EXPOSURE.

03:13:40.608 --> 03:13:41.443
AND THERE'S A DEFINITION IN

03:13:41.509 --> 03:13:42.711
THERE BUT IT KIND OF REQUIRES

03:13:42.777 --> 03:13:44.346
EMPLOYERS TO BE BOTH DOCTORS AND

03:13:44.412 --> 03:13:45.613
SCIENTISTS TO DETERMINE WHEN

03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:47.215
SOMETHING IS HARMFUL AND SO WE

03:13:47.282 --> 03:13:47.949
WANT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT

03:13:48.016 --> 03:13:48.917
MORE CLEAR BY TELLING THE

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:50.552
STANDARDS BOARD TO DO SOMETHING

03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:52.220
RELATED TO THE AIR QUALITY INDEX.

03:13:52.287 --> 03:13:53.488
IT'S MORE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND

03:13:53.555 --> 03:13:55.390
MORE CLEAR WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

03:13:55.457 --> 03:13:56.558
SURE THAT THERE'S A VERY

03:13:56.624 --> 03:13:58.193
TEMPERATE TEMPORARY VERY LIMITED

03:13:58.259 --> 03:13:59.894
EXEMPTION FROM THE MEDICAL

03:13:59.961 --> 03:14:01.096
EVALUATION AND FIT TESTING

03:14:01.162 --> 03:14:02.364
REQUIREMENTS UNDER CURRENT LAW

03:14:02.430 --> 03:14:06.634
THAT.

03:14:06.701 --> 03:14:07.168
WOULD ESSENTIALLY REQUIRED

03:14:07.235 --> 03:14:08.370
EMPLOYER BRING A DOCTOR OUT AND

03:14:08.436 --> 03:14:08.937
DO AN EXAMINATION OF EVERY

03:14:09.004 --> 03:14:09.504
SINGLE OUTDOOR WORKER BEFORE

03:14:09.571 --> 03:14:10.405
THEY COULD WEAR AND IN NINETY

03:14:10.472 --> 03:14:11.239
FIVE MASK AND THAT'S WE THINK

03:14:11.306 --> 03:14:12.173

03:20:40.795 --> 03:20:42.029
AFTER SIX MONTHS.

03:20:42.096 --> 03:20:43.464
IF THE RETALIATION INVOLVES

03:20:43.531 --> 03:20:44.899
TERMINATION THE WORKERS FIRED

03:20:44.966 --> 03:20:46.434
THEN WORKERS MIGHT COME FORWARD

03:20:46.501 --> 03:20:48.503
RIGHT AWAY BUT AS WE ALL KNOW

03:20:48.569 --> 03:20:50.571
RETALIATION OFTEN IS MUCH MORE

03:20:50.638 --> 03:20:52.507
SUBTLE THAT INCLUDES BEING NOT

03:20:52.573 --> 03:20:54.342
BEING PASSED UP FOR PROMOTION

03:20:54.409 --> 03:20:55.676
THERE WERE HOURS ARE CUT THIRD.

03:20:55.743 --> 03:20:57.178
SHIFT IS CHANGED IN THOSE

03:20:57.245 --> 03:20:58.446
SITUATIONS WORKERS OFTEN JUST

03:20:58.513 --> 03:21:00.114
TRY TO WAIT THINGS OUT AND HOPE

03:21:00.181 --> 03:21:01.249
THINGS GET BETTER.

03:21:01.315 --> 03:21:02.917
AND BY THAT AND OFTENTIMES

03:21:02.984 --> 03:21:03.918
THINGS DON'T GET BETTER AND AT

03:21:03.985 --> 03:21:05.353
THAT POINT THEY WILL TRY TO

03:21:05.420 --> 03:21:06.821
ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS IN WITH THE

03:21:06.888 --> 03:21:08.055
LABOR COMMISSIONER ONLY TO FIND

03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:09.290
OUT THAT THEY MISS THEIR SIX

03:21:09.357 --> 03:21:10.458
MONTH FILING DEADLINE.

03:21:10.525 --> 03:21:12.193
SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

03:21:12.260 --> 03:21:13.361
WORKERS ARE NOT DOT TO DOT

03:21:13.428 --> 03:21:15.196
DENIED ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY

03:21:15.263 --> 03:21:16.697
EXTENDING THAT FILING DEADLINE.

03:21:16.764 --> 03:21:18.566
THIS BILL ALSO WILL ALLOW

03:21:18.633 --> 03:21:19.700
WORKERS TO RECOVER THEIR

03:21:19.767 --> 03:21:21.002
ATTORNEYS FEES IF THE

03:21:21.068 --> 03:21:22.703
RETALIATION INVOLVES WHISTLE

03:21:22.770 --> 03:21:24.405
BLOWING WHICH WE THINK IS VERY

03:21:24.472 --> 03:21:26.374
IMPORTANT -- LABOR CODE SECTION

03:21:26.441 --> 03:21:27.642
ELEVEN A TWO POINT FIVE IS THE

03:21:27.708 --> 03:21:29.343
MAIN WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTE THAT

03:21:29.410 --> 03:21:30.678
PROTECTS WORKERS FROM

03:21:30.745 --> 03:21:31.979
RETALIATION IF THEY REPORT

03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:33.781
VIOLATIONS OF LOCAL STATE OR

03:21:33.848 --> 03:21:35.049
FEDERAL LAWS.

03:21:35.116 --> 03:21:37.718
ON IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE

03:21:37.785 --> 03:21:39.821
STATUE WAS AMENDED BY SB SIX SIX

03:21:39.887 --> 03:21:41.289
SIX IN AB TWO SIXTY THREE TO

03:21:41.355 --> 03:21:42.557
ALSO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANT

03:21:42.623 --> 03:21:44.725
WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE

03:21:44.792 --> 03:21:46.127
PROTECTED FROM A TALLY ASIAN.

03:21:46.194 --> 03:21:47.428
ART TOURNEY'S USE LABOR CODE

03:21:47.495 --> 03:21:49.297
SECTION ELEVEN OH TOO BUT POINT

03:21:49.363 --> 03:21:50.131
FIVE TO PROTECT WORKERS WHO

03:21:50.198 --> 03:21:51.866
REPORT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

03:21:51.933 --> 03:21:53.901
ASSAULT IN THE WORKPLACE WE'VE

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.236
HAD WORKERS WE HAVE I'D

03:21:55.303 --> 03:21:56.637
ATTORNEYS REPRESENT WILL SO

03:21:56.704 --> 03:21:59.207
BLOWERS WHO -- THE PHARMACY TECH

03:21:59.273 --> 03:22:03.377
WHO WHO WAS RIVER WHO WAS DONE.

03:22:03.444 --> 03:22:05.513
SHE WAS TOLD TO DILATE -- TO

03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:07.248
DILUTES SORRY TO THE LOO --

03:22:07.315 --> 03:22:09.217
CHEMO MEDICATION AND WHEN SHE

03:22:09.283 --> 03:22:10.618
REPORTED IT TO OSHA SHE WAS

03:22:10.685 --> 03:22:15.890
FIRED JUST.

03:22:15.957 --> 03:22:17.158
WEEKS LATER.

03:22:17.225 --> 03:22:18.025
SO IN THIS SITUATION WHERE YOU

03:22:18.092 --> 03:22:18.659
HAVE A WORKER WHO IS ABOUT TO

03:22:18.726 --> 03:22:19.961
BLOW THE WHISTLE ON FRAUD ABUSE

03:22:20.027 --> 03:22:20.595
MISCONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE IT'S

03:22:20.661 --> 03:22:22.163
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THE WORKERS

03:22:22.230 --> 03:22:23.831
ABLE TO SECURE LEGAL COUNSEL.

03:22:23.898 --> 03:22:24.799
AND WITHOUT ATTORNEYS HIS

03:22:24.866 --> 03:22:25.933
PROVISION THAT MEANS THAT THE

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:27.268
WORKERS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR

03:22:27.335 --> 03:22:28.669
THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATION

03:22:28.736 --> 03:22:30.238
THROUGH A PORTION OF THE AWARD

03:22:30.304 --> 03:22:30.872
THEY RECOVER AT THE END OF THE

03:22:30.938 --> 03:22:31.806
CASE.

03:22:31.873 --> 03:22:32.907
AND FOR A LOT OF WORKERS THAT

03:22:32.974 --> 03:22:34.208
MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO FIND AN

03:22:34.275 --> 03:22:35.843
ATTORNEY BECAUSE OF THE COST OF

03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:37.411
LITIGATION IS GOING TO EXCEED

03:22:37.478 --> 03:22:39.113
THAT CONTINGENCY FEE.

03:22:39.180 --> 03:22:39.947
THAT THE ATTORNEY IS GOING TO BE

03:22:40.014 --> 03:22:42.416
ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THE AWARD

03:22:42.483 --> 03:22:43.284
THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE ON THOSE

03:22:43.351 --> 03:22:45.720
CASES SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

03:22:45.786 --> 03:22:47.388
TO ALIGN THIS WAS A BLUR STATUE

03:22:47.455 --> 03:22:49.457
WITH ALL OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL

03:22:49.524 --> 03:22:51.058
WHISTLEBLOWER STATUTES THAT HAVE

03:22:51.125 --> 03:22:52.960
A AN ATTORNEY'S FEE PROVISION.

03:22:53.027 --> 03:22:54.629
WE THINK THAT THAT WAS A BLOWER

03:22:54.695 --> 03:22:56.931
LAWS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO

03:22:56.998 --> 03:22:58.566
PROTECTING WORKERS WHO ARE

03:22:58.633 --> 03:23:00.434
RISKING THEIR JOBS TO TO REPORT

03:23:00.501 --> 03:23:02.103
WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE AND FOR

03:23:02.169 --> 03:23:04.705
THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE

03:23:04.772 --> 03:23:05.039
YOUR SUPPORT.

03:23:05.106 --> 03:23:06.641
THANK YOU.

03:23:06.707 --> 03:23:07.208
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CAITLIN

03:23:07.275 --> 03:23:07.808
VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR

03:23:07.875 --> 03:23:09.377
FEDERATION -- WHEN AN EMPLOYER

03:23:09.443 --> 03:23:11.379
ENGAGES IN RETALIATION THAT

03:23:11.445 --> 03:23:12.513
MEANS THAT THE WORKER HAS

03:23:12.580 --> 03:23:14.315
ALREADY BEEN THE VICTIM OF AN

03:23:14.382 --> 03:23:16.217
UNDERLYING ACT THEY'VE HAD WAGES

03:23:16.284 --> 03:23:17.952
STOLEN THEY'VE BEEN SEXUALLY

03:23:18.019 --> 03:23:18.986
HARASSED?

03:23:19.053 --> 03:23:20.421
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PAID FAIRLY

03:23:20.488 --> 03:23:22.189
ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND THEN WHEN

03:23:22.256 --> 03:23:23.691
THEY REPORTED THEY GET

03:23:23.758 --> 03:23:25.092
RETALIATED AGAINST.

03:23:25.159 --> 03:23:26.794
THIS IS SO THAT MEANS THAT THIS

03:23:26.861 --> 03:23:28.396
IS A REPEAT OFFENDER THIS IS AN

03:23:28.462 --> 03:23:29.430
EMPLOYER WHO IS NOT ONLY

03:23:29.497 --> 03:23:31.699
VIOLATING THE LAW BUT THEN

03:23:31.766 --> 03:23:33.734
ACTING IN A WAY -- TO TO

03:23:33.801 --> 03:23:36.137
INTIMIDATE WORKERS FOR TRYING TO

03:23:36.203 --> 03:23:37.705
COME FORWARD AND SPEAK OUT.

03:23:37.772 --> 03:23:40.808
A TO LIMIT THOSE KINDS OF CLAIMS

03:23:40.875 --> 03:23:42.743
TO SIX MONTHS IS REALLY A WAY OF

03:23:42.810 --> 03:23:46.280
INSULATING EMPLOYERS WHO ENGAGE

03:23:46.347 --> 03:23:48.349
IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR --

03:23:48.416 --> 03:23:49.817
ALMOST ALL WORKERS TO REPORT

03:23:49.884 --> 03:23:51.919
WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS DO FACE

03:23:51.986 --> 03:23:53.654
RETALIATION AND SO ALLOWING THEM

03:23:53.721 --> 03:23:55.456
THE TIME TO COME FORWARD AND

03:23:55.523 --> 03:23:56.524
REPORT.

03:23:56.591 --> 03:23:58.025
IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

03:23:58.092 --> 03:24:00.094
CHANGE TO THE LOST SO WE'RE HERE

03:24:00.161 --> 03:24:03.331

I TESTIFIED EARLIER THAT I WAS

03:24:09.003 --> 03:24:10.538
RETALIATED.

03:24:10.605 --> 03:24:12.673
BECAUSE I SPOKE OUT OF BOUNDS.

03:24:12.740 --> 03:24:14.475

I FILED AN EQUAL PAY CLAIM AND

RETALIATION CLAIM WITH THE LABOR

03:24:17.678 --> 03:24:19.246
COMMISSIONER.

03:24:19.313 --> 03:24:20.848
BUT IT WAS REJECTED BECAUSE THEY

03:24:20.915 --> 03:24:22.483
SAID IT WAS MORE THAN SIX MONTHS

03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:24.452
AFTER RETALIATION HAD BEGUN.

03:24:24.518 --> 03:24:26.053
I FILED MY EQUAL PAY RETALIATION

03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:28.022
CLAIMS.

03:24:28.089 --> 03:24:29.557
BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A LAWYER.

03:24:29.624 --> 03:24:33.494
THAT WOULD TAKE MY CASE.

03:24:33.561 --> 03:24:34.729
WORKERS ABILITY TO FIND A LAWYER

03:24:34.795 --> 03:24:36.230

03:24:36.297 --> 03:24:37.398
TIME THAT SHE HAS TO SEEK

PROVISION WE ARE FINE WITH --

03:25:57.611 --> 03:25:59.747
BECAUSE THAT PROVISION ALLOWS

FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO FILE

03:26:01.115 --> 03:26:02.583

THAT IS IS THAT.

03:26:14.995 --> 03:26:16.530
EMPLOYEES ALREADY HAVE THE

03:26:16.597 --> 03:26:17.965
OPTION TO GO THROUGH CIVIL COURT

03:26:18.032 --> 03:26:19.366
THEY CAN FILE THIS CLAIM IN

03:26:19.433 --> 03:26:20.968
CIVIL COURT AND SO IT WHEN THEY

03:26:21.035 --> 03:26:22.236
FILE IT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT IT'S

03:26:23.671 --> 03:26:25.005
OFTENTIMES BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE

03:26:25.072 --> 03:26:26.607
DOES NOT WANT THE MORE LITIGIOUS

03:26:26.674 --> 03:26:27.675
PROCESS THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE

03:26:27.742 --> 03:26:27.908

03:26:31.378 --> 03:26:32.947
TO THIS PROCESS WHERE THE

03:26:33.013 --> 03:26:34.715
EMPLOYER ACTUALLY HAS NO RIGHT

03:26:34.782 --> 03:26:35.983
TO HEARING THEY HAVE NO

03:26:36.050 --> 03:26:37.618
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE

03:26:37.685 --> 03:26:39.954
THEY HAVE NO PER -- OPPORTUNITY

03:26:40.020 --> 03:26:41.522
TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN

REMEDIATE THOSE ATTORNEYS FEES

03:26:43.390 --> 03:26:44.391
THAT COULD QUICKLY ADD UP.

AYE VOTE -- SO THIS IS NOT

03:31:07.654 --> 03:31:09.123
ACADEMIC TO US THIS IS NOT

03:31:09.189 --> 03:31:10.858
MERELY HYPOTHETICAL -- EITHER

03:31:10.924 --> 03:31:14.061
PASSED OR PROLOGUE WE HAVE HAD --

03:31:14.128 --> 03:31:15.729
WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WHERE DO

03:31:15.796 --> 03:31:17.197
CONTRACTORS OF COME IN.

03:31:17.264 --> 03:31:18.999
AND WHERE IN FROM ONE DAY TO THE

03:31:19.066 --> 03:31:21.502
NEXT THE JOB IS THE SAME THE

03:31:21.568 --> 03:31:23.404
SERVICE IS THE SAME.

03:31:23.470 --> 03:31:25.005
AND AND EVEN INTO TIMES THE

03:31:25.072 --> 03:31:27.174
VESSELS REMAIN THE SAME THE ONLY

03:31:27.241 --> 03:31:29.343
THING PERVERSELY THAT CHANGED

03:31:29.410 --> 03:31:29.843

03:31:37.017 --> 03:31:37.885
EQUATION.

03:31:37.951 --> 03:31:39.286
AND WE DON'T THINK THAT'S

03:31:39.353 --> 03:31:40.587
REASONABLE FAIR OR JUST

03:31:40.654 --> 03:31:41.855
ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE

03:31:41.922 --> 03:31:44.091

IN EITHER OF THOSE INSTANCES WE

03:32:12.653 --> 03:32:14.254
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THE

03:32:16.090 --> 03:32:17.491
