AND WONDERED WHAT HE WAS DOING HERE HE IS OUR NEW CONTINUOUS COMMANDER HE'S REALLY HAPPY TO BE ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE LOOK AT THAT SMILE. HE LOVES WORK. AND A WE APPRECIATE HIS PRESENCE ON OUR COMMITTEE TODAY SO THANK YOU MISTER STEINORTH FOR BEING HERE. IN MISTER KILEY MINUTES RUNS OVER YOU AS YOU ARE THE VICE CHAIR I'M GOING TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE OH NINE. WHICH IS FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE I BELIEVE. IS IT. THAT. I DON'T. YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY ONE OH NINE WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE EDUCATION OF SERIOUSLY ILL STUDENTS. WHO REQUIRE INSTRUCTION AT HOME? OR IN THE HOSPITAL. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT STUDENTS ATTENDING HOSPITAL SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOME SCHOOLS IN A TIMELY MANNER. BY CLARIFYING THAT THE STUDENTS HOME DISTRICT DOES NOT NEED TO DO THIS AND ROLL THE STUDENTS. THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT A STUDENT WHO IS ENROLLED IN A HOSPITAL PROGRAM FOR FEWER THAN FIVE DAYS PER WEEK IS ELIGIBLE. TO ATTEND THEIR HOME SCHOOL ON THE OTHER DAYS OF THE WEEK. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO EXCUSE THE ABSENCES ABSENCES FOR STUDENTS RECEIVING HOME OR HOSPITAL INSTRUCTION SO THAT THE FAMILY DOES NOT RECEIVE TRUANCY NOTICES SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED. THIS BILL FURTHER REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE HOME INSTRUCTION. WITHIN FIVE WORKING DAYS OF A DETERMINATION THAT THE INSTRUCTION IS IN FACT REQUIRED. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES DISTRICTS TOURED HONORARY DIPLOMAS TO STUDENTS WHO ARE TERMINALLY. ILL. THESE ARE SMALL CHANGES TO CURRENT LAW. THAT WILL MAKE A LARGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN. AND THEIR FAMILIES. HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE KATHY รณ A TEACHER AT PACKARD'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. AND ANGELA RAMIREZ HOMES APPARENT. MISATO. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS KATHY AND I'M A TEACHER AT THE LUCILLE PACKARD CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD. AND EVEN THOUGH I AM EMPLOYED BY PAUL TO UNIFIED I HAVE WORKED WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TWENTY ONE OH NINE IS FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE FACING. MEDICAL CHALLENGES. UNTIL NOW HOSPITALS SCHOOLS HAVE ALWAYS WORKED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS A OUT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO SIX A DETERMINE RULES AND SET POLICY AND THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS RESULT IN THE MOST ACADEMICALLY. ADVANTAGEOUS SOLUTIONS FOR THE STUDENT OR THE MOST COMPASSIONATE POLICY FOR FAMILIES. SELECT IS HOW YOU ABOUT ONE OF MY STUDENTS STATED YA KNOW WHO CAME TO US AFTER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA. HIS JUNIOR YEAR. HE WAS FROM A LOCAL SCHOOL BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT DISTRICT FROM WHERE THE HOSPITAL WAS. SO EVEN THOUGH. YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL HE WAS NOT BEING SERVED BY HIS. HOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HE HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL SETBACKS AND WAS BY REQUIRING FREQUENT ADMISSIONS AND WHEN HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL. HIS SCHOOL WAS NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE THE WORK OR TO PUT MY INDEPENDENT STUDY BECAUSE HE WAS TECHNICALLY SLEEPING IN A DIFFERENT CITY. SO EVENTUALLY HE WAS DROPPED BY HIS HOME SCHOOL AND WE PICKED HIM UP IMPALA TELL. AND EVEN WHEN HE WAS FEELING BETTER AND WHEN HE WENT HOME HE WAS NOT ALLOWED ON TO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT WAS A CLOSED CAMPUS. SO THIS IS A MOTIVATED AND GREGARIOUS AND. YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE WITH HIS FRIENDS. SO I THINK WE AS EDUCATORS HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO EDUCATE CHILDREN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK WE NEED TO TEACH. EMPATHY AND COMPASSION AND WE NEED TO PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH. I THINK WE NEED TO FOSTER THAT BELIEF THAT EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT BUT THAT WE CARE ABOUT EACH INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS. SO I THINK EDIE TWENTY ONE OH NINE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. US STRUCTURE SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT STICKS BACKS WHEN ONE OF THEIR STUDENTS FALLS ILL OR IS INJURED. WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROTECT CHILDREN WHO ARE IN A WHO ARE HOSPITALIZED AND WE NEED TO BE THERE ADVOCATE BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR ENERGY TO BE BATTLING SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FOR THE BASIC EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS THAT EVERY STUDENT DESERVES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M THE PARENTS OF A CHILD DIAGNOSED WITH A RARE LIFE THREATENING BRING CONDITION SAYS ANDREW. I HOPE HE WAS DIAGNOSED FIVE YEARS AGO AT AGE EIGHT IN SECOND GRADE. WE STARTED THEN TO NAVIGATE OUR WAY THROUGH TRYING TO ADD TRYING TO. ACCESS EDUCATION SYSTEM WHILE ALSO PUTTING ALL OF OUR ENERGY INTO BATTLING A. LIFE THREATENING. ILLNESS MY SON HAS RECEIVED HOME HOSPITAL SERVICES TWO DIFFERENT TIMES WE'VE DONE INDEPENDENT STUDY WE'VE DONE MODIFY DAY WE'VE DONE PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE THINGS OVER THIS FIVE YEAR JOURNEY. I'M AS WE HOPEFULLY WAIT FOR MY SON TO BECOME AN ABM FREE. THERE ARE MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN MEAN MADE FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WHO ARE BATTLING SERIOUS ILLNESSES CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE USING ALL OF THEIR STRENGTH TO FIGHT THESE ILLNESSES. AND SHOULDN'T BE BURDENED WITH WHAT I SEE IS BUREAUCRATIC FEELINGS OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT WE'VE HAD A MEANT SUPPORT FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE I WAS A VOLUNTEER BUT WHAT I WASN'T WHAT IF I COULDN'T CALL AND GET A RESPONSE FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT. THAT MATTERS IT SHOULDN'T MATTER THAT I VOLUNTEERED A LOT IN NEW THE SUPERINTENDENT IN ORDER TO GET SERVICES FOR MY CHILD NEED. WE CAN DO BETTER ON A LOT OF FRONTS. I. CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE HEARTBREAK. THE HEARTBREAK IT IS TO GET A TRUANCY NOTICE FOR YOUR CHILD WHEN YOU WANT NOTHING MORE FOR THEM TO KEEP THE IN SCHOOL FULL TIME. LIKE A REGULAR KID PARENTS OF OF. CHILDREN WITH SERIOUS ILLNESSES OFTEN USE SCHOOL AS THE BAROMETER TO GET BACK TO NORMAL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR SCHOOL YOUR CHILD SUPPOSED TO BE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN SCHOOL. AND IT IS ONE OF. THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS TO. TRY TO DO BECAUSE THEY. IF YOU HAVE A SERIOUSLY ILL CHILD THEY DO NEED SPECIAL HELP AND AND AND. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE SOMETIMES ARE THE HOSPITAL'S INTO CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL IF THERE BE IN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS. AND. WHEN I GET THE TRUANCY NOTICE IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART I SHOULD LAUGH BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST COMICAL BECAUSE OF MY CREATE LET ME GO BEFORE THE TURN SUPPORT BUT. THAT'S ALL ROLLING ALL OUT FOR THEM. BUT I CRIED BECAUSE YOU WANT NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR KID TO BE IN SCHOOL AND THE LANGUAGE IN THOSE NOTICES ARE SUCH THAT THEY SAY. WHO WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU MISS HOMES HAS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUR CHILD ATTEND EVERYDAY? YEAH I KNOW I WISH THAT WERE POSSIBLE. SO I FEEL LIKE. THIS IS A REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN HELPING TO MEET SOME OF THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF SERIOUSLY ILL CHILDREN. IT IS MAKES A FEW MINOR CHANGES THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO FAMILIES AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE OH NINE. SERIOUSLY ALL STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL OF THE EDUCATION SERVICES THEY'RE ENTITLED TO IN A TIMELY MANNER. AND YOUR ACTIONS REALLY TODAY WHILE SEEMINGLY INCONSEQUENTIAL CAN TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF SERIOUSLY ILL STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THANK YOU.

BY THE NUMBER TWENTY THREE MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE CONSIDERATION TO GO EARLY SINCE WE HAVE SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY. THANK YOU. THAT PRESENT YOU A ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE THE BILL THE TACKLES THE FLAW THAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED. IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SINCE IT WAS INSTITUTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AN EFFORT TO TARGET RESOURCES TO THE HIGHEST NEED STUDENTS IN THE STATE. AS THE COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMICA SYSTEM BASED GRANT CONCENTRATION GRANTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE WOULD CREATE A NEW SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT GOING FORWARD FOR THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUB GROUP. OF STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHICH IS CURRENTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN S. EFFECTIVE SCORES CONFIRM A DISTURBING. BACK THAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED FOR YEARS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF INCOME ARE PERFORMING BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS AND MATH. ONLY THIRTY ONE PERCENT MET THE STATE ENGLISH ARTS STANDARDS AND ONLY NINETEEN PERCENT MET THE MATH STANDARDS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THE STATE. TWENTY SIXTY THOUSAND RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW INCOME. YEAH WELL ELL OR HOMELESS OR FOSTER YOU HOWEVER THERE IS A SUBGROUP OF ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT WHY WOULD NOT RECEIVING A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. AND NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF SUPPORT NOT TO IMPROVE THE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE THIS IS THE ONLY GROUP OF STUDENTS PERFORMING BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE THAT ARE NOT ALREADY RECEIVING. A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. IN ADDITION AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE THE LOWEST HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE OF ANY STUDENT GROUP OF SEVENTY TWO POINT NINE PERCENT AND ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST SUSPENSION RATE OF NINE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO BASICALLY ENHANCE INCORRECT THIS ISSUE. WITH THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THIS YEAR NOW'S THE TIME TO FIX THIS EDUCATIONAL INEQUITY. AND FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO TARGET RESOURCES TO STUDENTS THAT ARE MOST IN NEED. THAT'S WHAT OTHER LCF A FUNDS DISTRICT IN CHARTER SCHOOLS WAS STATE WHAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES THEY WILL BE OFFERING HIGH NEED STUDENTS IN THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. THIS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSURANCE THAT THE NEW FUNDING WILL BE TARGETED FOR LOCALLY DETERMINED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO BEST ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY FIVE IS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE CAUCUSES PRIORITY BILL FOR THE YEAR. IT IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND BUSINESS GROUPS INCLUDING THE SACRAMENTO AND THE LOS ANGELES URBAN LEAGUE. THE UNITED NEGRO COLLEGE FUND BLACK PARALLEL SCHOOL BOARD THE NATIONAL COALITION OF ONE HUNDRED BLACK WOMEN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF A BLACK SCHOOL EDUCATORS. CHILDREN NOW IT TRUSTS WEST THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION IT VOICE IN THE STATE IN THE PLACE THE PEAK AND A HOST OF OTHERS. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OR MARKET FORTUNE PRESIDENCIAL FORTUNE SCHOOLS A NETWORK OF SEVEN CHARTER SCHOOLS IN SACRAMENTO AND SAN MEDINA.

I AM JOINED HERE BY MY STUDENTS WITH A FORTUNE SCHOOL SCHOLARS PLEASE STAND. THEY ARE NINTH GRADERS WHO ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE FELL ON THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND THEIR ASSOCIATES DEGREE AT THE SAME TIME. YOU MAY BE SEATED. WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS CRITICAL TO THAT US AND THAT IS CLOSING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AS DOCTOR WEBER HAS STATED THIS IS THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP OUTSIDE OF STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. THIS ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT TO US IN SACRAMENTO THAT THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVED A NETWORK OF TUITION FREE. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS AS A PART OF A REGIONAL INITIATIVE TO CLOSE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AS A RESULT. WE'RE ONE OF TWELVE SCHOOLS. OF THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE A MAJORITY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT POPULATION THAT PERFORM IN THE TOP HALF OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN THE STATE. I AM IN THE TOP TEN PERCENT OF SIMILAR SCHOOLS THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOLS THAT ARE ON THE LIST THAT HAVE JOINED US TODAY. THIS IS HARD WORK AND IT TAKES RESOURCES AND IT TAKES FOCUS. BUT THE ISSUE OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS NOT JUST ABOUT INCOME. THERE'S SOMETHING MORE AT PLAY HERE THERE ARE NINETY THOUSAND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO BELOW WHO PERFORM BELOW AVERAGE. WHO ARE NOT LOW INCOME AND YET THEY STILL NEED OUR SUPPORT I'M VERY PROUD TO BE SITTING HERE NEXT TO? A A COLLEAGUE. FROM AN ASSOCIATION THAT ARE MY ASSOCIATION TYPICALLY SPARS WITH AND THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE PUTTING OUR DIFFERENCES ASIDE TO SUPPORT AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND ALL STUDENTS WHO ARE IN THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP TODAY IT'S% AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS TOMORROW COULD BE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THE NEXT DAY COULD BE BETTINO STUDENTS. THIS IS ABOUT EQUITY WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AND AS A SACRAMENTAL CLOSE BY SAYING WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT IS REALLY A HAS BEEN SCARRED. BY OF THE KILLING OF STEFAN CLARK. AND PLEASE SUMMARIZE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR STUDENTS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THAT THEY NOT JUST NOT BE TARGETED JUST BY THE POLICE. WE WANT THEM TO BE TARGETED. MY SCHOOL FUNDING THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DENNIS MYERS CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION ONE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THE BIGGEST TRANSIT LCF DEFICIT ALLOW SCHOOL BOARDS WORKING WITH LOW HUMIDITY. TO LOOK AT DATA TO FIND OUT WHERE THINGS NEED TO BE TARGETED WHERE RESOURCES NEED TO BE. SHIFTED BETWEEN TO HELP THINGS THAT AREN'T WORKING MOVING OVER TO FILL GAPS THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THIS BILL DOES IT USES DATA. THAT SHOWS THAT THERE IS A SUB GROUP THAT I'M NOT THE ENTIRE SUBGROUP IS QUALIFIED FOR THE FOCUS THAT IS INTENDED UNDER LC FF AND SO WE LOOK AT THE DATA. SAY THERE'S A US POTENTIAL SHORTCOMING OF LCF F. THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT LOOKS AT THE. WHOLE PORTION OF THE LOWEST SUBGROUP AND SAYS NOT ALL OF THAT SUBGROUP. QUALIFIES FEELS FF FUNDING AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTIRE SUB GROUP DOES. AND SO THAT FOR US IS WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE IT DOES AT THE STATE LEVEL WHAT OUR SCHOOL BOARD YOU TRYING TO DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO REALLY ACHIEVE. HIGH ACHIEVING LEVELS FOR ALSO GROUPS AND TO CLOSE GAPS. FASHION THAT WE'RE DOING NOW SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

WELL I WOULD LIKE TO SECOND THE. THE. THE MOTION I GOT HERE LATE. YES AYE I MEAN SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. I'M A CO AUTHOR I DON'T BELIEVE I'M LISTED BUT I AND THE CO AUTHOR AND. WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS ISSUE NOT THE BILL PER SE YESTERDAY OUR BUDGET. COMMITTEE AT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE. CONSIDERING FOR. IMPLEMENT FOR. FOR INSERTION IN THE IN OUR ANNUAL BUDGET ACT LATER THIS THAT THIS YEAR. I I MISS THE. THERE EARLIER TESTIMONY BUT CERTAINLY HEARD THE PRESENTATION YESTERDAY AND. SOME OF THE WITNESSES I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SON MISSING IN THE LC FF ON FUNDING. FORMULA. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE IS THAT AN IMPORTANT CHO WORKS AT STUDENTS THAT ARE SUCCEEDING IN OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND. REALLY INSPIRED TO SEE OUR OUR ADVOCATES FURTHER CHARTER SCHOOLS AND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL ADVOCATES ON THE SAME SIDE THIS ISSUE. I SAW SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS AND OTHERS AND SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL GET BEHIND. YOU KNOW WE HAVE AND NOT ONLY AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP AN OPPORTUNITY GAP BUT I THINK THIS IS. A GLARING. WEAKNESS AND OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD LEAVE. A TO MAKE IS BEHIND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. SUBGROUP THAT. WE OUGHT TO BE. DOING MORE WE'RE SEEING WHAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DOING WITH THEIR LCF FAST. SUPPLEMENTAL. CONCENTRATION ON AND THEIR ACT AND HOW TO ADD ONS AND SOME SCHOOLS ARE NOT IN THIS IS THAT CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY INVEST IN OUR NEEDIEST ON. SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO RACE ARE IN. THERE IS ONE ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO. TO REYES AYE PRODUCT. IN YESTERDAY'S HEARING TO SET A NUANCED ISSUE. THAT'S I I KNOW WHEN THE WHEN THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU YOU MAKE DOCTOR WEBER IS THAT. IF FOR EXAMPLE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN. SUBGROUP CHO WORKS. YOU KNOW RISES ABOVE THE MEDIAN AND THERE'S ANOTHER LET'S SAY ETHNIC GROUP WHETHER IT'S. LATINO I THINK THE EXAMPLE USES NATIVE AMERICAN THAT THAT FALLS. BELOW THE MEDIAN THAT NAY WOOD AGAIN. THE CREDIT. THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT THAT SUBGROUP. THERE THERE ISN'T IT ANY ISSUE WITH THE EP I POPULATION IN IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW SCHOOLS AS IN MY COUNSEL MY FORMER COUNCIL DISTRICT AND WRITE. IN MY ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHERE. YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE API SCORES VERY STRONG YOU LOOK AT THE SUBGROUPS OF THAT SUBGROUP SO HE JUST AGGREGATE. THE COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE SOUTHEAST ASIAN AMONG THE AND THE. SOUTH LAOTIAN COMMUNITY. THERE ARE SOME OF THE HIGH CONCENTRATION SCHOOLS. ARE AREN'T THE SAME AS ASIAN AS A WHOLE SIGH I WANNA ASK A DOCTOR WEBER. IF A AS POLICY GOES FORWARD WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE. THE GROUPS IN CALIFORNIA THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL CAN BENEFIT FROM THE NOTION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING FOR HERE WHICH IS WE SHOULD LEAVE ANY. A SUBGROUP BEHIND WITH OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION FUNDING. ALL YOUR ANSWER THAT OKAY Y. NOT. YOU IS KIND OF RHETORICAL BUT. SURE THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP. IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS. WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE LOWEST PERFORMING SUBGROUP SHOULD GET SUPPORT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IF THEY DON'T FALL INTO THE CATEGORIES? WHEN WE BEGAN LCF AFTER MOST OF YOU WEREN'T HERE AT THE TIME I WAS HERE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN WHEN THE GOVERNOR WAS PUSHING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORM IT. WE HEAR YOU HAVE NO YOU ARE HERE OKAY I WAS THE ONLY ONE HERE. THAT WAS AT THAT TIME A PART OF THE EFFORTS AND THE EFFORT WAS TO REALLY CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND WE THOUGHT BY ADDING CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF THAT WOULD COVER EVERYONE. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE IF WE LEFT TO THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE READS THE REGIONAL LANGUAGES NOT BI LINGUAL A SECOND LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION IT WAS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. WHICH WOULD HAVE COVERED MORE STUDENTS WHO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF BECOME PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH BUT THAT WAS TAKEN OUT AND SO AS A RESULT WE ENDED UP WITH THESE CATEGORIES. WE HAVE DISCOVERED NOW THAT IF WE LOOK AT THOSE THREE CATEGORIES OF INCOME OF FOSTER KIDS AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS THAT WOULD HAVE A GOOD NUMBER SUB GROUP IT IS PERSISTENTLY AT THE BOTTOM. AND THAT DD THAT ARE NOT POOR THAT ARE NOT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND SO THEREFORE AND NOT IN FOSTER CARE SO THEREFORE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING ELSE AT WORK HERE. AND IT'S A PERSISTENTLY LOW CATEGORY THAT IS THERE THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE WILL NEVER CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IF WE'D KNOW WHAT'S ON THE BOTTOM. SO IN A GROUP THAT BECOMES THE LOWEST ACHIEVING GROUP THAT HAS THIS GAP WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT NOW IT'S LOOKING AT AFRICAN AMERICANS OUR GOAL WAS NEVER TO BE ON THE BOTTOM ALWAYS TO BE ON THE TOP. SO AS WE MOVE UP THERE MAY BE OTHER GROUPS TO COME INTO EXISTENCE. SOME OF YOU PROBABLY WERE HERE WHEN WE TRY TO DO SOME THINGS WITH THE API COMMUNITY AND I WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER BONTA FOR THE OPEN AREA. WHEN HE WANTED TO DESEGREGATE THE POPULATIONS IN IN IN THE API COMMUNITY. AND. AND I WAS VERY UNFAVORABLE SPOKE IN FAVOR OF IT VOTED IN FAVOR BECAUSE I'VE DONE THAT WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD IN SAN DIEGO AND WE HAD LOTS OF MEMBERS OF THE API COMMUNITY IN LUMPING THEM ALL TOGETHER. JULIE DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING AND. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE NUMBERS WOULD LOOK LIKE MATTHEW DISAGGREGATED IT BUT IT MAY SHOW THAT BUT THEY ARE STILL CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT LIKE THE OTHER API. AND I THINK MOST OF US VOTED FOR BOTH WHATEVER HAPPENED VIA API THAT DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THIS OBVIOUSLY LCF F. SHOULD BE A LIVING DOCUMENT THE CONSTANTLY LOOK AT ITSELF EVALUATES ITSELF AND THIS POINT. THE LOWEST ACHIEVING GROUP THAT WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF IN TERMS OF OUR BREAK OUT IS AFRICAN AMERICAN BUT IT COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE AT THINK AS. AS THE MISFORTUNE MENTIONED EARLIER IT COULD BE ANOTHER GROUP IN ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS AS WE PROGRESS INTO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO. OUR GOAL IS TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT. AND THAT AND AND FACING THIS ISSUE THAT'S HERE AND MAKING THIS RECOMMENDATION FOR THIS BILL IS THE FIRST STEP OF US TRULY BEING. EIGHT A STATE THAT LOOKS AND TRIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DOCTOR WEBER. I WAS DIRECTLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MATTER THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TODAY. I THINK CALIFORNIA WILL DO JUSTICE ABOUT EVERY GROUP WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AND EVALUATE AND ASSESS AND USE DATA TO BASICALLY PROBABLE IT FORWARD WE KNOW EDUCATION IS THE AMERICAN EQUALIZER EQUALIZE THE WORLD FOR MOST OF US IN THIS ROOM. AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. I THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER FOR BEING A RELENTLESS IN FEARLESS CHAMPION FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. IT'S GREAT TO SEE MANY OF OUR STATE'S HIGHEST IMPACT EDUCATION LEADERS I IN THIS ROOM TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING. THE CHAIR WILL NOT YOU THE OTHER CHAIR. AND YOU. AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR HELPFUL INSIGHT. AND COLLABORATIONS ON THIS BILL AND I AM ACCEPTING OF THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AT THE LEGISLATURE UPDATED THE PROCESS FOR DISMISSAL OF THE PERMANENT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. THAT BILL AMONG OTHER THINGS CREATED AN EXPEDITED PROCESS FOR REMOVAL OF SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO'VE COMMITTED EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT AND ADDED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARD TO DISCLOSING REPORTING EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT AND MAINTAINING EVIDENCE IN EMPLOYEES FILE. AB TO FIFTEEN PROVIDED THE FRAMEWORK NEEDED TO PROTECT STUDENTS FROM SERIOUS FORMS OF MISCONDUCT BY GIVING LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS A MECHANISM TO ASSURE AN OFFENDING EMPLOYEES PROMPT REMOVAL FROM THE CLASSROOM. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN HOWEVER SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN GOVERNING BOARDS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS MISCONDUCT INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR WITH STUDENTS. AS A RESULT THERE'S SOME SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WERE STAYING IN THE CLASSROOM EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. TODAY'S BILL ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE AND FURTHERS THE PURPOSE OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. INTO S.. FIRST IT MODEL IT IT THAT IT MODIFIES THE DEFINITION OF AGREE JUST MISCONDUCT IN EDUCATION CODE SECTION FOUR FOUR NINE THREE TWO. TO INCLUDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT THIS ALLOWS THE EXPEDITED DISMISSAL PROCESS CREATED BY AB TWO FIFTEEN. TRIGGERED IN CASES WHERE EMPLOYEES ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY HARASSING STUDENT. SECOND FOR AN EMPLOYEE CHARGED WITH MISCONDUCT THE BILL ALLOWS LOCAL SCHOOL OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER THEIR HISTORY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR. WITH THE SUIT STUDENT. EXISTING LAW ONLY ALLOWS EVIDENCE AND TESTIMONY THAT DATES BACK FOR YEARS EXCEPT IN THE MOST SERIOUS INSTANCES OF ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT OR CHILD ABUSE. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR OTHER INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR EVEN IS OLD IS ORDER AYE THAN FOR YEARS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A PATTERN. OF MISCONDUCT. TODAY'S BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN MEETING TO PRESSING SOCIAL CHALLENGES. MAKING OUR SCHOOLS SAFER AND ROOTING OUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHT MAKES COMMON SENSE CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING JUST MITCHELL STATUTE AND BETTER PROTECT KIDS FROM PREDATORY BEHAVIORS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY IS JULIE HARADA TRUSTEE ON THE ROADS BILL JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND STEVE WILLIAMS THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OPERAS WILL JOIN UNITED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MY NAME IS JULIE HAVE RHODA AND I'M IN A UNIQUE ROLE AS A SCHOOL TRUSTEE AND A MOTHER OF TWO SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. I'VE LEARN MORE ABOUT TEACHERS AND STUDENTS AND I CAN IMAGINE IN THIS ROLE. AND I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED TO LEARN THE LIMITS THAT I HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHER MISCONDUCT. TODAY WE NEED YOUR HELP ADDRESSING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE CLASSROOM THESE DAYS PARENTS LIKE ME. ASSUME THAT THE SAFEST PLACE FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHEN AT SCHOOL IS WITH THEIR TEACHER. THIS IS USUALLY TRUE BUT AS THE TRUSTEE I'VE LEARNED THAT IN SOME INSTANCES IT IS NOT. IT'S UNSAFE WHEN A TEACHER AND ADULTS. SEXUALLY HARASSES STUDENTS ARE CHILDREN. THE HARASSMENT IMPAIRS THE RELATIONSHIP DISRUPTS THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND TEACHERS ARE KIDS THAT IT'S OKAY TO BE THREATENED. THIS IS A LESSON THAT WILL BE IMPRINTED ON THEM FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. SEXUAL HARASSMENT CAN BE VERY SUBTLE. SO MUCH THE KIDS MIGHT QUESTION THE REALITY AND THEIR ROLE IN IT. IN FACT IN RECENT HEADLINES WE'VE SEEN THAT MANY ADULTS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN COMING FORWARD. AND WHEN A STUDENT FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS ADULTS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT STUDENTS AND CHILDREN. I'M ASKING YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO INCLUDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE AGREE JUST MISCONDUCT AND TO REMOVE THE FOR YOUR HISTORICAL LIMITATION OF PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE. THE PROPOSED CHANGE PUTS OUR KIDS FIRST AND IMPROVES THE SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS AT SCHOOL. AS A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN ALL THEN KNOW THAT SCHOOLS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO ASSURE THEIR SAFETY. PLEASE SUPPORT THIS REQUEST THAT WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. YES. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS STEVE WILLIAMS I'M THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF PERSONNEL FROM THE ROSEVILLE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'M ALSO A FATHER OF FIVE CHILDREN AND SIX GRANDCHILDREN. SO THIS ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AS IT IS WITH MANY IN THE ROOM TODAY. WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT. TO BETTER HOLD EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTABLE FOR SEXUALLY HARASSING STUDENTS AND OTHER EMPLOYEES. WE'RE ASKING YOU TO GRANT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE ALL INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BUT AN EMPLOYEE FOUND HAVE MERIT. NO MATTER HOW LONG IT OCCURRED AS EVIDENCE IN EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE MATTERS. WE FEEL FRUSTRATED. IN OUR HANDS FEEL TIED BECAUSE WE CAN ONLY NOW GO BACK FOUR YEARS WHEN DETERMINING DISCIPLINE. FOR EMPLOYEE WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED A PATTERN OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. MISCONDUCT IN THIS BEHAVIOR. FOR EXAMPLE IF AN EMPLOYEE SEXUALLY HARASSES STAFFERS STUDENTS BUT THEN DOESN'T ENGAGE IN SUCH BEHAVIOR FOR FOUR PLUS YEARS. WE ARE NOW UNABLE TO USE THE INITIAL ACTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AS EVIDENCE IN A DISCIPLINARY HEARING. ADDITIONALLY. WHEN FACED WITH SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE REPEATEDLY BEEN REMINDED TYPICALLY BY THE EMPLOYEES LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO INCLUDE INCIDENTS BEYOND. THE FOUR YEAR MARK AS PART OF THE RECORD. THAT IS A VERY HARD PILL FOR US TO SWALLOW. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE MEAT TO MOVEMENT. AND ARE ASKING YOU TO HELP US SEND A VERY LOUD. CLEAR AND FIRM MESSAGE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN OUR SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. AND IN PARTICULAR REPEAT OFFENDERS. WHO CANNOT REFRAIN FROM SUCH BEHAVIOR WILL BE APPROPRIATELY DISCIPLINE? PLEASE SUPPORT THIS REQUEST AND GIVE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE.

SOBRE PUSHED OF THAT SOMEONE GOT LOCKED OUTSIDE. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS JULIA BROWN AND. HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME IS JULIA BROWN I'M SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND I'M A SENIOR AT BY SELENA. CHARTER INDEPENDENT STUDIES WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT STUDIES PROGRAM OF I SAW UNIFIED. TIME HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR AYE FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS. I AM A YOUNG PARA MY SON JORDAN IS ABOUT SIX WEEKS OLD BEFORE ATTENDED VC I S. I WANT TO SO KOREA HIGH SCHOOL OF AYE SO USED. UNIFIED MY TEACHERS AND ADMIT AT SOME POINT I KNEW I WAS PREGNANT. AND I WAS AROUND EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT I BEGAN HAVE YOU START PAINS OF MY UTERUS WHILE AT SCHOOL. AS THE PAIN GOT WORSE I FINALLY WENT TO THE OFFICE TO TELL THE MINISTRATION WHAT I WAS FEELING. I'M. IT WAS SO INTENSE THAT THE PRINCIPAL DECIDED TO CALL THE AMBULANCE. ONCE I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL I FOUND OUT I WAS EXPERIENCING EARLY CONTRACTIONS MY DOCTOR OFFICIALLY PUT ME ON BED REST AND WROTE A NOTE FOR MY. SCHOOL TO AND THAT I NEEDED TO BE EXCUSE FOR MATERNITY LEAVE US APART I WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE HIGH AT MY HIGH SCHOOL. TOLD ME WE DON'T DO MATERNITY LEAVE SO I HAD TO COME TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY TO MY WATER BROKE. MY MOTHER WAS VERY LIVID SO SHE CALLED VESSEL UNIFIED IN THE ADVICE SUPPORT HIGH THAT I NEEDED TO BE. PUT ON THE BUS SO QUIET STILL RESISTED. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT EVENTUALLY CURSE ME TO ENROLL AT THE CI US FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES. WHEN I DID FINALLY GIVE WORTH BY SO YOU. FEW CIS ONLY GAVE ME ONE WEEK A MATERNITY LEAVE AND. EXPECTED ME TO BE REPORTED BACK TO SCHOOL THE FOLLOWING WEEK.

A LOT OF YOUNG MOTHERS WHO HAVE. ME AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAVE TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. HE MEMBERS MY NAME IS WENDY COOLEY MIND AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR OASIS FOR GIRLS AND SAN FRANCISCO. NEVER WORKED FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS OF PREGNANCY PREVENTION AND INITIATIVES. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO TWO EIGHT BECAUSE IS A TANGIBLE WAY THAT WE CAN SUPPORT YOUNG PARENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LEVELS POLICIES OFF ACROSS THE STATE AND ENSURES THAT CREDITING STUDENTS HAVE THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO BOND WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND GO TO SCHOOL. SO STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PREGNANCY CAN MOTIVATE YOUNG PARENTS TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL BUT YET DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THERE EITHER PUSHED OUT. TO INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT DOES NOT MEET COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS OR THEY DROPPED OUT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TIME TO. BE PRETTY PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR THE NEW RESPONSIBILITY IS A PARENTING IN SCHOOL. SO WE ARE ESTIMATING IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE ARE CLOSE TO TEN THOUSAND PET PREGNANT APPARENTLY STUDENTS THAT DROPPED OUT IN CALIFORNIA. INTERFERENCE TURNING STUDENTS DON'T RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THAT ANY PARENT WOULD REGARDLESS OF AGE THEY'LL HAVE AN ECONOMIC UPHILL BATTLE. WITH THEY WILL EARN ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS A YEAR THAN THEIR STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND TWENTY THOUSAND LAST YEAR THAN THOSE WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. AND THIS WILL ACTUALLY IMPACT THEIR IMMUNE NOT ONLY PACKED THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS BUT IT WILL IMPACT THE NEEDS OF THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN. CHILDREN WHO HAVE. CHILDREN WHO HAVE EARLY BONDING TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS EXHIBIT BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES LIKE BETTER PROBLEM SOLVING COPING IN DECISION MAKING SKILLS AND THESE ARE THE FUTURE OF STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH MY YEARS OF WORKING TO SUPPORT YOUNG WOMEN I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THE CAL STATE PROGRAM. IN THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THE YOUNG PARENTS HAD VITAL RESOURCES THEY NEED IT'S A BOND AND CARE FOR SICK CHILDREN THEY COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL OR RETURNED TO THEIR ORIGINAL SCHOOL REGULAR SCHOOL. SO THIS PROGRAM SIDE GRADUATION RATES HIGHER THAN THAT OF SOME CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THEY'VE WAS DO FUNDED WITH THE CREATION OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING CAP A LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND THE NUMBER COUNTY SIDES DECREASED FROM HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN SO ONLY FIFTY TWO. SO ONE OF THE THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PROGRAMS THAT THEY THAT. AND NOW WE HAVE TO PIECE MEAL THESE PROGRAMS SO WE ARE URGING YOU TO SUPPORT AB TWO TWO EIGHT NINE. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOUNG PARENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

SCHOOL DAYS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE A TREMENDOUS VEHICLE FOR OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND MEANINGFULLY EXPANDING THE REACH OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR SO MANY CHILDREN IN NEED. TREATING CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS CAN POWERFULLY OVERCOME ISSUES OF COST OF STIGMA. TRANSPORTATION AND THAT TYPICALLY RESTRICT THE BROAD UTILIZATION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AB TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS THE BRAINCHILD OF THE YOUTH. WHO ARE ENGAGED ON THIS ISSUE AND THEY ARE RAISING THE BAR? ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES IT'S TIME TO LISTEN TO THEM.

AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY FOUR. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU BOB MEMBERS FOUR TO ONE OF THANKED CHAIR. AND COMMITTEE FOR FOR WORKING ON MY WORK WITH MY OFFICE I WILL BE DECLARE YOU DO HAVE A SUPPORT SUPPORT ON THIS OKAY. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT SAY. AB TWO TO THREE FOUR WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS WHO ARE TESTIFYING IN EMPLOYEE DISMISSAL HEARINGS WAS SUMA PROTECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO MINORS AND OTHER LEGAL SETTINGS. ARE AB TWO TO THREE FIVE WOULD PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGES WITH THE DISCRETION TO ALLOW THE USE OF A TWO WAY CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION OR VIDEO TAPES DISPERSED DEPOSITION. AS AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF TESTIMONY FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF THE EGREGIOUS ACTS BY SCHOOL EMPLOYEE THE BILL ALSO REQUIRED A VICTIM ADVOCATE BE APPOINTED TO EACH CHILD WITNESS TO ACCOMPANY HIM THROUGHOUT A PROCESS THAT CAN. BE EMOTIONALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY DRAMATIC WITH ME TODAY RK CALLINGS AND SHERRY MO ATTORNEY FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY WILL SHARE TO SPECIFIC CASES THAT INSPIRED HIS BILL. AND ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE IS TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. BOTH I KATE COLLINS FROM LAUSD CORD. IT'S AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING BUT IT'S LIKE A COURTROOM SETTING. THE NEED TO. TREAT THE SICK JUST FEET AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ABUSE THEM ARE MISTREATED THEM. ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT. AND THEY'VE TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEM. AND AT THIS POINT THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN INTERROGATED BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. OFTENTIMES IF THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH A SITE INVESTIGATION. A DISTRICT INVESTIGATION. DISTRICT ATTORNEY INVESTIGATION. AND THEN WE START THIS PROCESS WHERE PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS GET INVOLVED. AND WHAT I'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS IS REALLY HARD TO TAKE. SOME STUDENTS ARE SO FEARFUL BY THE TIME THEY GET TO THIS PROCESS. I HAD TO LEAVE THE STATE. OKAY EVER HAD SO MANY JUST NOT SHOW UP. AND THAT ARE OPTION IS OKAY LET'S. SUBPOENA THEM AND YOU KNOW. MOVED TO GOOD HEALTH REQUIRE THEM TO COME TO COURT THEY'RE SCARED. AND. IF. SO WE DO THIS FOR YEARS BUT WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME WAS A CASE ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND IT WASN'T EVEN THE MOST EGREGIOUS. IT WAS CASE INVOLVED AN EDUCATOR. WHO WOULD THROW THINGS AT A STUDENT? BUT THE STATE WAS VERY VULNERABLE. SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT AND DUMB. HE CAME AND HE SHOWED UP. AND HE'D BEEN CONSISTENT ALL THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS. BUT ONCE HE WAS INTERROGATED BY. PRETTY AGGRESSIVE ATTORNEYS ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE JUST FELL PART. HE STARTED SPINNING AROUND IN HIS CHAIR AND ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING CONSISTENTLY OVER THE YEARS. HE WASN'T MAKING THINGS UP. SO I WENT DOWN TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. AND I SAID EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON TO ME. AND SHE SAID IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE PLEASE YES THIS IS TRAUMA. WHAT'S HAPPENING THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED BEGINNING EVERYTIME AFTER REPEAT THE STORY AND THEN TRAUMATIZED. SO CRUELLY IN THE AND. WHAT WE HOPE TO TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS PROVIDE THEM JUST THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY AFFORD? YOUNG PEOPLE. IN OTHER FORA THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS GERRY NO I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY MY ROLE IS TO LITIGATE THESE CASES BOTH CERTIFICATED AND CLASSIFIED. THAT INCLUDES THE EGREGIOUS ONLY MATTERS. THIS BILL AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR SEEKS TO AFFORD LEGAL PROTECTIONS TO MINOR WITNESSES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE IN ANY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING HOWEVER BECAUSE THE CHILD'S ALLEGATIONS ARE LITIGATED AND ADMINISTRATIVE COURT. THEY ARE NOT PROVIDED THESE RIGHTS. AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR DOES NOT IMPLICATE THE DUE PROCESS AND PORTS OF AB TWO FIFTEEN. AB TWO FIFTEEN WAS PRIMARILY ABOUT THE PROCEDURE LEADING UP TO THE HEARING. WHERE IS THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE HEARING ITSELF? AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR IS EXTREMELY NECESSARY FOR REASONS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT. TO NOTE EVEN THOUGH SOME OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES HOW DISCRETION UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CODE TO APPLY SPECIAL PROTECTIONS TO MINORS. pCONSISTENCY AND I SPEAK ABOUT THIS FROM EXPERIENCE I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU ALL THAT THIS INCONSISTENCY IS DUE TO THE LACK OF STATUTORY GUIDELINES AVAILABLE. FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES TO CONSIDER. UNLIKE EVERY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT DOES INVOLVE A MINOR WITNESS. AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR IS NARROWLY TAILORED. TO ONLY AFFECT AGREE JUST MISCONDUCT CASES AND EXPEDITE THE PROCESS FOR ALL PARTIES IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS FIRST. UNDER AGREE JUST ONLY PROCEDURES THERE'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DISCOVERY PROCESS WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOVERNED BY THE GOVERNMENT CODE IT'S NOT GOVERNED BY THE EDUCATION CODE. THERE ARE NO INITIAL DISCLOSURES THERE'S ONLY A DEMAND FOR DISCOVERY AND THAT DEMAND TYPICALLY INCLUDE THE DEMAND FOR CONTACT INFORMATION OF THE MINOR. UNDER FEDERAL LAW SCHOOL DISTRICTS CANNOT DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION CERTAIN. ABSENT CERTAIN LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. AND SO A SUBPOENA IS BY FAR THE MOST EFFICIENT PROCESS TO SATISFY THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT. THE SECOND WAY AND MAYBE TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR WOULD STREAMLINED THE DEPOSITION PROCESS AN EGREGIOUS ONLY MATTERS THIRD AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE ANY COMMUNICATION BY THE DISTRICT. OR BY THE EMPLOYEE TO GO THROUGH A VICTIM ADVOCATE OR AT ADULT ATTENDANT. PARENTS CAN BE GREAT ADVOCATES FOR THEIR CHILDREN BUT IT'S A REALITY THIS MONTH FOR PARENTS HAVE MULTIPLE JOBS THE MULTIPLE CHILDREN THEY MAY HAVE IMMIGRATION CONCERNS LANGUAGE BARRIERS IS A BIG ONE IN LA UNIFIED. AND THEY MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR THEY JUST DON'T KNOW THEIR RIGHTS IN A COURT SETTING. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO DO ANYTHING NEW ALL OF THESE PROTECTIONS BEEN SOUGHT BY AB TWENTY TO THIRTY FOUR ARE AFFORDED IN EVERY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE HIS SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OR PRESIDENT ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND SUPPORT. NO THIS IS SUPPORT OF ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR SETH BRAMBLE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY. AND OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWO TWO THREE FOUR. I WILL BE BRIEF. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES ALREADY HAVE ALL KINDS OF DISCRETION WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING CHILDREN. IN THESE KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS AND DO REGULARLY EXERCISE THAT DISCRETION. ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS BILL WILL MAKE THE PROCESS TAKE LONGER IT WILL MAKE IT COST MORE AND IT COMPROMISES THE DUE PROCESS OF EDUCATORS. WEIRD YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. AYE IN SONG LAWYER WAIT THEY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. WE SEE IF CA PASTRAMI BELIEVES IN PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A SAFE. SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT TO BE AND. WE HAVE TAKEN AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND WHERE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS JONES SAWYER FOR IT THAT. WE ARE SEEKING AMENDMENTS HUH TOO NARROWLY TAILOR THIS TWO WAY CIRCUIT VIDEO TESTIMONY TO EGREGIOUS MISCONDUCT CASES SIMPLY. BECAUSE WE WANT TO PROVIDE CHILDREN A SAFE PLACE TO TESTIFY BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR MEMBERS. THERE TO PROCESS RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. WE ESPECIALLY IN CASES IN WHICH THERE MAY BE FALSE ACCUSATION SO THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING IN A EL CHE. BEAT THE PRESIDING OFFICER AT THE EVIDENTIARY HEARING WILL ENSURE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE. WE ALSO ARE. SEEKING AMENDMENTS TO AND OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION I THINK. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEING NO OTHER OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ANY COMMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE WANT ONE QUESTION ONE QUICK QUESTION DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON. HOW OFF THE MOON ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES DON'T GRANT THIS? THE REQUESTED NOT HAVE THE PERSON THERE TESTIFIED. I THINK IT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S I THINK AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW MY HEART IS ALWAYS WITH STUDENTS CLEARLY. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN. INFLUENCED BY A JUDGE IN A LAWYER WHO WAS A HUSBAND MY AMBIVALENCE ABOUT IS THAT RIGHT OR IS IT NOT RIGHT YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE FAIRNESS WOULD WE FIND THE JUSTICE. AND I KNOW WE'RE TALKING BY KIDS AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND STUFF WHO WERE ALSO TALK ABOUT ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES TO SO. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD TAKE A LOT OF AUTHORITY OFTENTIMES AWAY FROM JUDGES AND THEN HAD TO GIVE IT BACK. SO I'M REALLY PARENTHOOD ABOUT TAKING THE AUTHORITY AWAY FROM JUDGES WHOSE TASK IS TO HEAR BOTH SIDES THAT POINT ABOUT THE JUDGE'S AUTHORITIES AND LIKE I SAID WE'VE. IN THIS HOUSE AT OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE GONE BACK TO RESTORING THE AUTHORITY OF THE JUDGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO LOOK AT THE SITUATION. AND MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS SO DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW. THAT THIS IS BROKEN I GUESS OF WHAT I'M SAYING. IT AND I COULD JUST MISSED. MY UNDERSTANDING IS FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS THAT THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF BILLS TO CLARIFY THAT A JUDGE DOES HAVE THIS DISCRETION. OKAY. OKAY WITH WE CAN'T HEAR YOU UNLESS YOU PUSH A BUTTON. OKAY I ONLY KNOW OF ONE CASE WHERE THE JUDGE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED CLOSED CIRCUIT THAT ENHANCE OF. ACTUALLY THERE BUT IT'S NOT ENFORCEMENT IS NOT SUPPORTED MISS MOST CAN ADDRESS THIS. OKAY. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND THE CURRENT STATUTORY SCHEME IS JUST UNCLEAR SO THIS IS SEEKING GUIDANCE THE MOST OFTEN RESPOND TO HEAR FROM THE MINISTER OF OUR JUDGES IS. WHY NOW THAT YOU'RE MOVING FOR THIS BUT DO I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO IT THAT'S ALSO AT THE GOVERNMENT CODE BECAUSE IT'S ALL WE HAVE? WILL SAY YOU KNOW I I JUST DON'T I DON'T THEY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR AUTHORITY IS AND SO THIS IS JUST SEEKING TO CLEAR THIS IS NOT CLEAR FIVE A COAT YES OKAY SOUNDS GOOD ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.

WEBER I. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU COMMITTEE SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU. WILL NEXT. GO TO OUR. MY GOD JUNE SIR. JIM ARE SIMILAR FRAZIER THE PRESENT. YEAH IF FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY ONE FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE YOU HAVE RECEIVED IN WRITING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T A AMENDMENTS. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THE BILL AND. COMMITMENT TO HELP STUDENTS WITH ABILITIES. AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY ONE IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT INSURES THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DEPARTMENT REVOLT REHABILITATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE COORDINATING EFFECTIVELY TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS WILL DEVELOP DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THROUGH THAT INITIAL PHASES OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY ONE FOCUSES ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR GOALS. IT MAKE SURE THAT A PERSON WITH AIDID THE WHO HITS THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO. WILL NOT BE LEFT BEHIND ONCE THEY LEAVE SCHOOL DISTRICT. I RECOGNIZE THE DEPARTMENTS ARE WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES WITH THE GOAL OF COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. PER THE CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE IN AGREEMENT INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT BLUEPRINT. WHAT HURTS MY HEART IS THAT ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF INTO INDIVIDUALS ID DE? ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED. OUR INTENTION IS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRESS BEING MADE IN THE BLUEPRINT. AND SURE THE BLUEPRINT HAS THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE STUDENT SUCCEEDS. WITH ME TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND SPEAK TO THE NECESSITY OF THE BILL ARE DOCTOR LIBYA RAINER AND SANDY GATE GEOGHAN. A PARENT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL THANK YOU. AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF NAME IS OLIVIA RAINER I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE TORSION CENTER. A UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE AT UCLA. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHAT WE HEAR OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IS EXPERIENCED AS FALLING OFF A CLIFF AND HERE'S WHY. WHEN A STUDENT IS IN K. TWELVE EDUCATION THERE'S A GUARANTEED SYSTEM OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AND FAMILIES GENERALLY KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. THEY LEAVE THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM AND THE LEGAL MANDATE FOR THE SUPPORT ENDS THEY LACK THE KNOW HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE OTHER AVAILABLE SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT. THE US RATHER THAN GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ON THEIR OWN ALL TOO OFTEN DO NOT CONNECT WITH VITAL. OF VOCATIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE OBTAINED THROUGH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND HENCE THE CLIFF.% AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK I SPOKE WITH A MOTHER WHOSE SON WITH AUTISM AND GRADUATED WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND DID NOT HAVE PLACE AND NEVER FOUND A JOB. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS THIS YOUNG MAN HAS BECOME A COUCH DWELLER THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WOULD WANT FOR ANY STUDENT. APPLYING EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOO ADDRESSING THE% CLIFF WE KNOW WHAT WORKS WE JUST NEED TO CREATE POLICIES AND INCENTIVES TO DO IT. THE USE OF INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION. AS PROPOSED IN THIS OP BILL IS CONSIDERED AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE IN SCHOOL TO WORK TRANSITION THAT LEADS TO BETTER ADULT OUTCOMES TO EMPLOYMENT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AND REHABILITATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT CALLED THE CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT BLUEPRINT FOR CHANGE. THIS PLAN WAS CREATED TO IMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA'S OF FIRST POLICY AS WELL AS ADDRESS OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES. THE OVERALL GOAL WAS TO JOINTLY ADDRESS THE NEED FOR EMPLOYMENT IN AN INTEGRATED SETTING AT A COMPETITIVE WAGE FOR INTELLECT INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ANIMATED ITS HIGHEST PRIORITY. WHILE ESTABLISHED AT THE STATE LEVEL ITS IMPLEMENTATION IS LOCAL AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY ONE CONTINUES THIS BY CREATING STATEWIDE GUIDANCE. THAT HAPPENS PERSON TO PERSON STUDENT TO STUDENT. AB ONE SEVENTY ONE MAKES THE FOLLOWING UP FIVE PROPOSED CHANGES. FIRST IT HAS THE BOARD OF EDUCATION ADOPT THE EXISTING EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY OF THE STATE. SECOND IT ASKS THE THREE DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE SECTIONS OF THEIR SERVICE PLANS ADDRESS HOW THEY WILL WORK TOWARD THE SAME COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT GOAL. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT. THIRD IT ASKS THE THREE DEPARTMENTS TO FIND WAYS TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE COORDINATION ON PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. FOURTH IT ASKS THE THREE DEPARTMENTS FIND WAYS TO SHARE DATA THEY HAVE ON PEOPLE WITH TO SOME STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IF YOU COULD SUMMARIZE OUTCOMES. MAYBE BETTER TRACKED I'M ALMOST. LASTLY IT GIVES STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR PARENTS ACCESS TO THEIR OWN RECORDS AND FILES ALLOWING THE PERSON TO ACCESS THE DATA AND SHARE IT AS HE OR SHE CHOOSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS. HI MY NAME IS SANDRA GEOGHAN AND I AM THE PARENT OF KYLE GEOGHAN AND EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR. THIS IS HIM AND THE PITCHER YOU CHOSE FOR ME TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE DREAMS THE DREAMS OF HIS PEERS AND THE STRUGGLE THEY AND US PARENTS ARE HAVING PLANNING FOR THEIR FUTURE. LIKE MOST EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS HE HAS DREAMS OF INDEPENDENCE AND WORK THAT HE FINDS MEANINGFUL AND PROFITABLE. HE HAS A VERY CREATIVE IMAGINATION AND HIS FUTURE TERRAIN CONSISTS OF WRITING A BOOK. THIS YEAR HE HAS STARTED USING VOICE TO TEXT TO WORK ON HIS WRITING SKILLS. HE HAS NOW ACKNOWLEDGED HE NEEDS A PILLAR JOB. BUT HE HAS NO IDEA WHAT TYPE OF JOB YOU MAY WANT TO PURSUE OR HAS PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT JOB SKILLS HE WILL NEED TO FIND. TO FIND A JOB AND TO KEEP ONE. AS IS ADVOCATE OBTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE A BILL TO SUPPORT HIM IN TRANSITION IS REMINISCENT OF THE DIFFICULT EARLY YEARS WE HAD. LOOKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS IT AND SUPPORT AND PLACING SUPPORT SERVICES INTO PLACE. I'VE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS RESEARCHING WHAT IS AVAILABLE FOR OUR SON YET STILL I'VE NOT FOUND A PROGRAM FOR HIM THIS SUMMER OR DETERMINE WHAT WILL BEST FIT HIS NEEDS NEXT YEAR. AT A PARENT GROUP. I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE LEARNING ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE. I SPOKE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD GO TO THE I EP WITH ME LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO BUT CONFIRMED THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSITION TYPE SERVICES UNTIL HE IS TWENTY TWO. AT THE I EP THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIRECTOR TOLD ME I DO NOT HALF LOOK TO THEM FOR SERVICES. BUT THAT KYLE COULD CONTINUE WITH THIS CURRENT PROGRAM. AND HE STARTED WITH SOME WORKABILITY HOURS WHICH HE STARTED LAST WEEK. FORTUNATELY IN MY SEARCH ANOTHER PARENT ADVOCATE RECOMMENDED I ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION TO ATTEND HIS IEP. IT WAS THE FIRST IEP THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION ATTENDED THAT SHE HAD EVER ATTENDED IT WAS OF. SHE PROVIDED SOME HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. BUT THAT WORK ABILITY WOULD GO THROUGH THE SCHOOL. IT STILL REMAINS CLOUDY. SO THIS EXPERIENCE IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU ARE LEARNING ABOUT YOUR CHILD'S NEEDS WHEN YOU WANT TO BRING A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS TOGETHER TO PLAN FOR THEM. AB TWENTY ONE SEVENTY ONE ONE PERSON ONE GOAL WOULD ASSURE THAT EACH AGENCY HAS MORE CLEARLY ARTICULATED PULLS. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN PREPARING BICU MY SON TO LEAVE SPANK YOU READY TO WORK IN THE ARMY OTHERS IN SUPPORT WE THANK YOU. EVELYN ITEMS PASS AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE WERE INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BLUEPRINT AND I'M STRIKE YOU PUT THIS BILL. Q..

MEMBERS WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FROM LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED OAKLAND SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO. THE SUBURBAN DISTRICTS TO RULE DISTRICTS THEY'RE ALL SAYING THE SAME THING. WHICH SAYS THAT DESPITE SIGNIFICANT SCHOOL FUNDING RESTORATION THAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN RECENT YEARS. THOSE FUNDING INCREASES ARE NOT KEEPING PACE WHAT THE INCREASES IN FIXED COSTS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING IN UPCOMING YEARS. WE ARE PROPOSING A SOLUTION AB TWENTY EIGHT AWAY. A SOLUTION BUT I'D BEEN WORKING ON WITH THE EDUCATION COALITION AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT IS PROPOSING LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BASE GRANT. FUNDING TARGETS. THAT WILL MAINTAIN THE EXISTING FORMULA. THIS BILL WILL A STABS FUNDING TARGETS TO PROVIDE FULL AND FAIR FUNDING FOR ALL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE. THESE FUNNY TARGETS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE CONTAINED IN THE ORIGINAL LCF BATH. WELL WE PASSED THE L. CFF IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE PASSED IT WITH FUNDING TARGETS TO GET THE STATE BACK TO PRE RECESSION FUNDING LEVELS. BY TWENTY TWENTY. NOW THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO REACH THE FULL FUNDING TARGET TWO YEARS EARLY. DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE ASKING WHAT'S NEXT. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT IS THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. BY PROVIDING ASPIRATIONAL FUNDING TARGETS TO GET THE STATE TO AT LEAST THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN PER PUPIL SPENDING WE ARE MAKING A STATEMENT THAT K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING. IS AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE OUR STATE'S TOP PROJECT BUDGET PRIORITY. AB TWENTY EIGHT OR A TO SUPPORTED BY OUR PARENTS OUR TEACHERS OR ADMINISTRATORS ARE SCHOOL BOARDS AND. OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT TOM TILLOTSON. AND RULE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE I ASK YOU TO JOIN THIS GROWING COALITION BY SUPPORTING AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT. I'M HONORED TO HAVE WITH ME THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION FOR THE STATE PTA LEAH TARA. AS WELL AS SO ALSO REPRESENTING THE REDONDO BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT A LONG TIME PTA ACTIVIST I NEED TO AFRICA. GOOD AFTERNOON AND CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CALPERS THE PTA WHICH REPRESENTS SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AS A CO SPONSOR AT EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHT OH WAIT. THIS BILL ADDRESSES ONE OF OUR KEY ADVOCACY GOALS. IMPROVING EDUCATION FUNDING FOR ALL CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY TWO EIGHT AWAY. I'M A PARENT OF FOUR KIDS MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SCARLETT IS IN THE EIGHTH GRADE. OVER THE YEARS ARE RAISING MY CHILDREN THEY'VE ALL ATTENDED SCHOOLS PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALTERING THEIR CLASSROOMS I'VE SEEN THE CUTS TO EDUCATION FUNDING IMPACT CLASSROOMS. I WISH I COULD SAY THIS IS ONLY A PROBLEM MY COMMUNITY. BUT AS A P. T. LEADER I'VE HEARD HORROR STORIES FROM MY FELLOW PTA VOLUNTEERS AT THE IMPACT THESE EDUCATION FUNDING CUTS HAVE. CROSS THE STATE. STORIES OF CHILDREN NOT HAVING DUST SISSETON. AND IN CLASSROOMS IT WAS FORCED TO PUT OUT WHICH LISTS FOR BASIC SUPPLIES LIKE KLEENEX AND PENCILS. TEACHERS. A SEWING CLASS WITH BROKEN SEWING MACHINES AND NO FUNDS TO FIX THEM. BROKEN AND DANGEROUS P. EQUIPMENT. AND SCIENCE LABS THE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES. IN FACT OUR HIGH SCHOOL PTA HOW TO RAISE MONEY FOR BIOLOGY SUPPLIES WE LITERALLY HAD TO FUNDRAISE FOR EYEBALLS. AND DISPOSABLE WAS FRIDAY SECTION LAB IT'S FUNNY BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY WHEN THE TEACHER CALLS AND SAYS CAN THE PTA PLEASE HELP. LIKE ALL PARENTS AYE ONE EIGHTH GRADER TO GET THE BEST EDUCATION SHE CAN. WITH THE CURRENT LEVEL OF PER PUPIL FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE NEAR THE BOTTOM IN THE NATION. AS A PARENT BY THIS UNACCEPTABLE. AB TWENTY OH EIGHT TEN TWENTY EIGHT NO EIGHT CAN BRING MORE MONEY INTO OUR SCHOOLS. EFFORT CANBRING US UP TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF PER PUPIL FUNDING. OUR CHILDREN DESERVE THAT AT LEAST. I'M EXCITED TO SEE SOLUTION I CAN HELP EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. I BELIEVE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. ALL MY CHILDREN ATTENDED PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I VOLUNTEER PUBLIC SCHOOLS. MY SEATS ABOUT TIMES BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING SOME BETTER TIME TO THE PASSAGE OF AB TWO EIGHT OH EIGHT. SO ONCE MORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE ABOUT IT SUPPORT THIS BILL. THINK. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. A PENNY THE AVERAGE CRIME THE PRESIDING OFFICER FOR ALL SCHOOL BOARD REDONDO BEACH. THE HEART OF THE LC FF CHALLENGES THE INADEQUACY OF THE BASE FUNDING. UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS DISTRICTS WITH HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF KIDS OF POVERTY ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOUTH AND UP WITH MORE OVERALL FUNDS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THOSE STUDENTS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY STRUGGLED TO KEEP THE BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE DISTRICT RUNNING FOR THE SAME FOR ALL THE KIDS INADEQUATE BASE FUNDING CREATES PRESSURE FOR SUCH DISTRICTS. TO FIND MORE WAYS TO UTILIZE A TARGETED DOLLARS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CHILDREN IT DEFEATS THE VERY PURPOSE. OF THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THEY GET. THE FUNDING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REDONDO BEACH AND NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES ARE OPT UP TO AND OVER TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A STUDENT. THAT MAKES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE. THE BASE FUNDING IN L. L. C. F. F.. SHOULD BE THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO ENSURE A DECENT EDUCATION FOR ALL OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS STUDENTS. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE COMMITMENT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE PROTECT OUR FUTURE BY INVESTING IN THE LC FF BASED SO THAT IT ADEQUATELY SUPPORTS EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND ENABLES CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. THAT ARE IN POVERTY ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND FOSTER YOU. I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH TWO THOUGHTS. ONE WE ARE EDUCATING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY IN A FEW YEARS. HEALTHY FF AS A MECHANISM WE USE TO DECIDE HOW MUCH DISCRETIONARY DOLLARS ARE DISTRICTS RECEIVE IN THE STATE IT IS THE WAY WE DIVIDE THE PIE UP IT DOES NOT INCREASE APART SO PLEASE INCREASE OUR PIE.

SENIOR OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK AMONG JUST MAKE A QUICK COMMENT HOME. SOME MIGHT SEE THIS IS ASPIRATIONAL PROBABLY THIS MAYBE EVEN CEREMONY A LITTLE BIT OF THAT TOO BUT I ALSO THINK IT. IT SETS A PARADIGM GOING FORWARD. WITH THEIR. HAVE FUNDING IN OUR GOALS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THIS STRUCTURE ASSOCIATE LCF HAVE THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS VERY IMPORTANT. I THINK GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT SACRAMENTO CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WE TRIED THAT IT DID NOT CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP NOW WE'RE TRYING ANOTHER WAY. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE THIS WAY THROUGH. AND VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE THIS BILL TODAY BEFORE US BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW UNDER TWENTY LEGISLATORS WHO ON THE LEGISLATURE WARS THEY WANT TO CREATE THEIR OWN CATEGORICAL WELL HUNDRED NINETEEN AND WE ONE OF THEM. BUT DOWN THAT WANT TO CREATE YOUR OWN CATEGORICAL PROGRAM NEXT YEAR. AND WE NEED TO RESIST THAT WE NEED TO SEE THIS THROUGH WE NEED TO GIVE THE LOCALS CONTROL. WE NEED TO IVE THEM THE TOOLS FUNDING THE RESOURCES THE ABILITY TO DESIGN THE PROGRAMS THEY NEED. AT THEIR LOCAL LEVEL WE HEARD A MANY BILLS TODAY AND MANY OF THE SPEAKING TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BECAUSE WE ARE A VERY DIVERSE STATE. IN WHO WE ARE AND AND THAT'S WHAT THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULAS MEANT TO ADDRESS CERTAINLY THAT BUT ALSO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BASE THE BASE IS VERY IMPORTANT WE RAISE THE BASE. IT'S AND I YOU KNOW A FREE AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION FOR EVERYONE. IN MY WORRIES THAT SOMEDAY WE MAY SEE A LAWSUIT ALMOST THE RIVER A REVERSE SERRANO THE PRIEST RIGHT THAT SOME STUDENTS ARE THE BASES A HIGH ENOUGH FOR THEM. TO GET ADDED ADEQUATE EDUCATION SO WE DO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT BASE. AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT FORWARD AS WELL ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER KILEY. I GOT HIM SOME ARE SUCH GOOD AFTERNOON. YEAH ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE. THE LANDMARK GUY GETTING DOWN TO FACTS STUDY. THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT A DECADE AGO. UNDER GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER OUTSOURCING YES RIGHT. YEAH JUST A LITTLE BACKGROUND FOR THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR I IT WAS A RESEARCH PROJECT OF MORE THAN I. TWENTY STUDIES IS I TO PROVIDE CITIZENS WILL COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF THIS. STATE SCHOOL FINANCE AND GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. OVER EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD IT BROUGHT TOGETHER AN EXTRAORDINARY ARRAY OF SCHOLARS FROM THIRTY TWO INSTITUTIONS WITH DIVERSE EXPERTISE AND AWFUL POLICY ROUNDABOUT ORIENTATIONS IT REPRESENTS AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTEMPT. TO SYNTHESIZE WHAT WE KNOW AS A BASIS FOR COMMITTING THE NECESSARY PUBLIC CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD DO. AND DIE SO PRETTY ARE FAR REACHING EFFORT COMMISSIONED BY THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION EXCELLENCE AND. SOME OF THE. THE FINDINGS. WERE PRETTY INTERESTING I HERE'S ONE OF THAT MORE MONEY IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS UNLIKELY TO UP TO FOR MAGICALLY IMPROVE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT TO MEET EXPECTATIONS UNLESS ACCOMPANIED. BY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC REFORMS. COST ESTIMATES FOR IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT ARE ONLY MEANINGFUL WHEN VIEWED IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER REFORMS. S. ASSIST THAT TIME YOU KNOW UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN WE'VE INCREASED THE ANNUAL EDUCATION BUDGET BY. THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS. BUT I CAN YOU IDENTIFY THE SIX SYSTEMIC SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC REFORMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. WELL I THINK. WE JUST HAD A BUDGET HEARING. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FUNDING AND. WE HAD TESTIMONY FROM. SUPERINTENDENTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INDICATING THAT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROVE MEN'S AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. WELL WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE GRADUATION RATES THE A THROUGH G. COMPLETION RATES THE. SUSPENSION RATES. THE DROPOUT RATES AND SO. CLEARLY YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T JUST THROW MONEY AT A PROBLEM AND EXPECT TO SOLVE EVERYTHING BUT. CLEARLY. MONEY DOES MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND. YOU KNOW YOU CAN TELL THAT TO ANY. PARENTS WHO IS SEEING THEIR. WHO HAS SEEN THEIR CLASS SIZES INCREASE AND YOU'RE HAVING TO? DO FUNDRAISING FOR BASIC SCHOOL SUPPLIES WHEN THERE IS AN ADEQUATE FUNDING AND SO. WHILE YOU KNOW I. RECOGNIZE YOUR POINT THAT. THAT MONEY DOESN'T SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS THEY CLEARLY. GOES A LONG WAY STATE AND IF I MAY INTERJECT HERE I'M AN EXPERT ON SCHOOL BUS SAFETY AS WELL SCHOOL FINENESS ON IMPACT. AND I HAVE TWO KIDS I HAVE A SEVENTH GRADER IN NINTH GRADE YOU WANT THEM AND SEAT BELTS WHERE HE AND I. I HAD MY MY OLDEST WENT THROUGH CLASS SIZE REDUCTION. IN MY US DID NOT AND I BELIEVE THERE'S AN IMPACT EVEN TODAY IN THEIR PERFORMANCE. I I REALLY TRULY BELIEVE THAT AND THE IN AND AND AND THAT HAS IMPACTED THEIR ACADEMIC ABILITY DAY. IT BUT I ALSO WANT MY KIDS TO FIELD TRIPS. I ALSO WANT THEM TO MORE MUSIC CLASSES. AYE I WANT THEM TO HAVE AN ENRICHING EXPERIENCE IT ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT ACHIEVEMENT BUT ITS FULFILLMENT WHICH LEADS TO ACHIEVEMENT OFTEN I THINK. AND EIGHT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE QUANTITATIVE BUT IT'S OFTEN THE QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCE IN A CHILD'S SCHOOL THAT MAKES THEM WANT TO COME BACK THAT ENGAGED IN THAT HELP SINCE SEAT AS A HUMAN BEING. IT ISN'T ALL ABOUT THAT TEST SCORES PART OF THAT FOR SURE BUT IT ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WAS UNAWARE OF THE BREADTH OF YOUR EXPERTISE. AND I AM MORE I HAVE MORE COMING. BUT I AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T DISAGREE WITH WITH WITH A LOT OF THAT. BUT IF WE SPEND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS MORE PER YEAR AND BY THE OBJECTIVE MEASURE. THE NEEDLE HASN'T MOVED I THINK THAT THE PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY IT WAS PREDICTED OVER TEN YEARS AGO IN THIS STUDY THAT JUST PUTTING IN MORE MONEY. WITHOUT SYSTEMIC REFORM. ISN'T GONNA LEAD TO ANY PROGRESS AND IT'S ESPECIALLY I THINK. DISCOURAGING WHEN WE SEE GREAT EXAMPLES OF SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DOING THINGS RIGHT AND GETTING GREAT RESULTS. AND WAS THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE MADE SYSTEMIC REFORMS THAT HAVE LIFTED ALL STUDENTS. IN MEANINGFUL WAYS AND BIOMETRICS THAT MISTER O'DONNELL REFERRED TO. I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE. LEGISLATE ASPIRATION ONLY. THAT'S FINE BUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THOSE ASPIRATION SHOULD BE STUDENT. ACHIEVEMENT IN LIFE SUCCESS NOT JUST FUNDING AND FORGET IT YOU KNOW MARK MARK OUT HOW DO WE GET TO HAVE THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. SURE INCREASE FUNDING MIGHT BE A PART OF THAT. BUT THAT'S NOT THE END GOAL AND THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW INCREASINGLY A LOT OF THE MONEY ISN'T GOING TOWARD THE CLASSROOM WE HAVE DISTRICTS THEY'RE HAVING TO CUT BACK ON THINGS LIKE TEACHER SALARIES BECAUSE SUCH A BIG PART OF THEIR BUDGET. IS A POST RETIREMENT. OBLIGATIONS AND WE'RE NOT DOING A LOT AT TO ADDRESS THAT SO. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I. WHEN WE. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE'RE GOING AS A STATE. THIS CONVERSATION WHAT THE RIGHT FUNDING LEVEL SHOULD BE DEFINITELY NEED TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION BUT IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TODAY WHEN I SEE. THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THINGS WE NEED TO DO CONSISTENTLY BEING NEGLECTED BY THIS COMMITTEE SO I THANK YOU FOR BRING THIS CORDON CONTRIBUTED COMPENSATE. THANK YOU NAY OBSERVED YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE MISTER COLLEAGUES I THINK WE SURE YOU SEE SUPPORTING AN INCREASE IN FUNDING YES THAT'S PART OF IT I ALSO THINK. WHAT HE'S SAYING HERE'S LOCAL CONTROL IS BEST I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD IN THE FOUR YEARS? AND LET'S ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT GOING BACK. I DURING THE RECEPTION ARE RECESSION HOW MUCH DO WE GET IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EDUCATION FUNDING WENT WAY DOWN. WERE NOW COMING BACK IN JUST ABOUT TWO THOUSAND EIGHT PURCHASING POWER SOURCE STILL DOWN. AND TO EDUCATE KIDS IT TAKES MONEY. IT TAKES STAFF IT TAKES FACILITIES IT TAKES OPERATIONS PURSE. SO IT IS NOT A CHEAP VENTURE. AND AND IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE YOU KNOW. I JUST THINK MY OWN KIDS AND AND YOU'LL YOU'LL GET THEIR KILEY AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT I'M SURE I'M GONNA SEND YOUR KID YOUR KIDS THE SCHOOL ALL WE ASK YOU FOR ON THE LARGEST. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ONE LARGER CLASS SIZES FOR MY CHILD. CONFIDENT THAT WHEN YOU WALK YOUR LITTLE KINDERGARTENERS AND THEY'RE GONNA SAY THIS CLASS SIZES IT IS TOO SMALL WE WANT MORE KIDS. SUBJECT JUST YOU KNOW. BE OPEN MINDED I WOULD ONLY ASK. DOCTOR THANK YOU OF AND I'M NOT WILL DECLARE MYSELF AN EXPERT ON OWN FINANCES SCHOOLS. BUT I DO WANNA AND THEN I APPRECIATE MR KYLIE'S COMMENTS ALWAYS BALLOT IN IMPORTANT CONCERNS. AND PROBABLY NO ONE THE BANGS HARDER THAN I DO ABOUT STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT HERE AT THIS AT THIS HOUSE. AND I NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT I'VE ALSO ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING HAS TO BE A PROFESSION OF DIGNITY AND IT'S MATCHED BY THE RESOURCES SOMETIMES THAT WE PUT INTO IT. THAT THE VALUE OF WHAT WE BELIEVE AND IS OFTEN REFLECTED IN WHERE WE SPEND OUR MONEY. AND HOW WE SPEND OUR MONEY AND IF WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE OF SIGNIFICANT. THAT THE EDUCATION THEY GET WILL BASICALLY UP ENHANCE THEIR LIVES THEN WE HAVE TO INVEST IN IT THAT IS A ME WHENEVER HOLDEN ACCOUNTABLE. AND IN FACT I THINK THE MORE WE GIVE THE MORE BUT LE BUT IT ALSO HELPS US TO DEVELOP THE KIND OF EDUCATIONAL SETTING. IT HELPS TO DEVELOP THOUGH THE TEACHING STAFF THAT WE WANT THAT WE TALK ABOUT CONSTANTLY ABOUT HAVING OUR TEACHERS IS REALLY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL INFLUENCE AND CHANGE THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN EVERY DAY. ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE CRITICAL WELL IF FOR TEACHERS TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO STUDENTS AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM. A TEACHER HAS TREMENDOUS POWER. TREMENDOUS POWER CHANGE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN FOR THEIR WHOLE LIFE. AND HOW TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A CLASSROOM WHERE YOU REALLY GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO AND TO MEET WITH STUDENTS. ARE AND TRANSFORM THEM. INTO A RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS AS A RESULT OF YOUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEM AND TO MEET WITH THEM ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAD SOME OF THE BEST OF SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD AND WE STILL DO IT WITH OUR OUR K. TWELVE IN OUR POST SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE LOST OUR IT BECAUSE WE HAVE LOST THAT WE'VE TAKEN OUR EYE OFF OF WHAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON. AND WE SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT. THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY I MEAN INCREASE IN JUVENILE HALL THE INCREASE IN PRISONS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS IS A DIRECT RESULT SOMETIMES. OF OUR INABILITY TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SCHOOL SYSTEM MORE TEACHERS TO REALLY MEET AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS OUT OF THERE. AND SO I THINK WE'LL SEE A LOT OF POSITIVES THAT COME FROM WITH FACING TEACHER SHORTAGES WHEN I WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY WAS HARD TO TALK TO A PERSON ABOUT GOING INTO EDUCATION. WHEN THEY DIDN'T THINK THAT IT WAS GOING TO NOT ONLY JUST BE A PRODUCTIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. BUT ONE THAT PUTS A WOOD MAY LIVE IN POVERTY MOST OF THEIR LIVES A IN TRYING TO JUST SIMPLY KEEP THE PROFESSION THAT WAS THERE. AND THE IDEA OF THE PROFESSION OF TEACHING BECAUSE I HAD TEACHERS WHO I THOUGHT WERE MILLIONAIRES AND THEY WORK BUT THEY LOOK LIKE IN THE ACT LIKE IT AND THEY HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THEM. THAT WE SOMETIMES DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS TODAY AND SO I YOU KNOW THIS IS INVESTMENT IT'S IT'S LIKE A WISH LIST WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A. THAT WE MAY NOT GET THERE. BUT I ALWAYS BELIEVE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING ANY ROLE TO TAKE YOU THERE. AND WE DO KNOW WHERE WE WANT TO GO IN THIS IS A PATH THAT'S GOING TO LEAD US THERE. AND IT DOESN'T DOESN'T RELIEVE US OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE KNOW THAT MONEY IS NOT ALWAYS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING. BUT IT CAN GIVE US THE RESOURCES AND THE SUPPORT TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THIS THE YEAR. SOME GRATEFUL THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD BECAUSE SURELY WE'VE DONE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WITH THEIR NOW THE QUESTION IS NOT JUST TO STAY THERE BUT WHERE DO WE GO FROM THERE. AND HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND THAT HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO BRING US THROUGH SCHOOLS UP TO WHERE THEY NEEDTO BE. AT A LIKE TO BE IN THE FORTIES. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE YOU KNOW I WAS ALWAYS SAY WHEN WE BELOW MISSISSIPPI ALABAMA WE IN TROUBLE INSULT. YOU KNOW SO I DON'T I DON'T WANT MY SCHOOLS IS TO BE THERE BECAUSE I WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. WE WERE IN THE TOP TEN. IN TERMS OF SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND AND OUR TEACHERS HAD DIGNITY AND PRIDE ABOUT THEIR PROFESSION Y. BECAUSE A PROFESSION AND THE AND THE STATE HAD PRIDE IN THEM. AND SO I I THINK THIS IS A GREAT ASPIRATIONAL GOAL I THINK IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD AND WORK HARD BECAUSE IT TAKES ALL OF THIS TO CREATE THE KIND OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THAT I WANT TO BE PROUD OF THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE PROUD OF AND THAT I KIDS DESERVE SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND I AND I LOOKED UP MOVE THE. I THINK WE'VE ALREADY HAD A MOTIONS OF THIS WE HAVEN'T IF NOT THEN I MOVE. THIS BILL. THE MOVED AND SECONDED. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS YOU MAKE CLOTHES THURMOND AYE WEBER AYE AYE WEBER AYE. FOR VOTE THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU YOU HAVE ONE OTHER MISTER MURATSUCHI. WHICH IS.

WHETHER ONE OR MORE PESTICIDES SHOULD BE BANNED. AND THREE TO AUTHORIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF PASSED. A REGULATION TO CONSULT WTH OTHER STATE FEDERAL AGENCIES STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS IN DEVELOPING SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS A BILL CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN MY DAUGHTER GOING TO ONE OF MY LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS I WAS FACING. AN ISSUE INVOLVING. TOXIC PESTICIDE OF BEING USED AT HER SCHOOL OF FOLLOWING THAT THERE WAS AN UPROAR AMONG PARENTS AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW I. REALIZED THAT THAT THIS IS A PART OF AN ONGOING EFFORT THAT'S BEEN CONDUCTED FOR MANY YEARS TO ADDRESS. TOXIC CHEMICALS COMMONLY BE BEING USED AT OUR SCHOOL GROUNDS WHETHER IT'S. A ROUND UP WHETHER IT'S PUMA TOXIN BUT THE LIST IS LONG IT TOO LONG BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE IS A GROWING SCIENTIFIC. CONSENSUS THAT PESTICIDES WELL BECAUSE HEALTH. SIX SIGNIFICANT HEALTH PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY FOR OUR CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE U. S. ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AGENCY PESTICIDE EXPOSURE CAN CAUSE. CANCER REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS DEVELOPMENTAL AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. AS WELL AS OTHER. ILLNESSES. FURTHERMORE THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES REPORTS THAT CHILDREN ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHEMICALS THAN ADULTS AND ESTIMATES A FIFTY PERCENT. OF LIFETIME PESTICIDE EXPOSURE OCCURS DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE. MOST RECENTLY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS CLASSIFIED LIKE TO SAY. COMMONLY KNOWN AS ROUNDUP AS A LIKELY CARCINOGEN. MORE MORE EVIDENCES IS GROWING THAT PESTICIDES CAN BE DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY FOR OUR CHILDREN AND THAT IS WHY I AM INTRODUCING THIS BILL. TO. CUT DOWN AND ULTIMATELY TO WORK TOWARD BANNING OF THESE TOXIC. CHEMICALS. AT OUR SCHOOLS I AM PROUD TO BE JOINED HERE TODAY BY THE TWO WITNESSES. OF FIRST A. GUADALUPE GARCIA. GONZALEZ. PARENT. AND.

THIS IS ABOUT GETTING MORE KIDS INTO COLLEGE. CURRENTLY STUDENTS IN GRADES THREE THROUGH EIGHTH AND ELEVENTH. ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE. SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT TEST STATE REQUIRED TEST FOR THOSE GRADES. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADMINISTER A COLLEGE AND CHURCH AND ENTRANCE EXAM SUCH AS THE ACT OR THE ACT THE SAT OR THE ACT. INSTEAD OF THE STATE REQUIRED ASSESSMENT FOR ELEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS THIS IS ELEVENTH GRADE ONLY. OVER THIRTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING OAKLAND SAN JOSE SACRAMENTO IN MY HOME DISTRICT LONG BEACH ARE CURRENTLY OFFERING THE SAT OR THE ACT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY FOR FREE IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE. THE COLLEGE ATTENDANCE RATE. AND OPPORTUNITY FOR SURE. AS A MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. HEAR MY REASONS FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. THE SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT IS ATTACHED IT IS NOT ASSESSMENT IS SIMPLY ATTACHED. THE SAT IS AN ASSESSMENT. WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT A TEST TELLS YOU WHERE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ARE? AND ASSESSMENT SHOWS YOU HOW TO CLOSE THOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. BEGINNING TODAY IN THE EIGHTH GRADE STUDENTS CAN TAKE THE PSA T.. WHICH STEEP WHICH TEACHERS CAN USE TO ADDRESS GAPS IN STUDENT LEARNING. THE S. BACK WAS INTENDED TO BE MORE USEFUL TO TEACHERS BUT IS NOT THERE YET AFTER FOUR YEARS THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED THEIR MISSION WERE WAITING. THE SAT IS MEANINGFUL TO STUDENTS THEY HAVE A STAKE IN DOING WELL. THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TESTING AND GIVE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS MORE TIME FOR INSTRUCTION. ELEVENTH GRADE IS A BUSY YEAR. STUDENTS ARE NOT ONLY TAKING THE RIVER THAT REQUIRED STATE TEST BUT ALSO EIGHT P. AND COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS. AND LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL. WE'LL ACCOMMODATIONS BE REQUIRED ABSOLUTELY THE ANSWER IS YES. ACCOMMODATIONS WILL BE BASED ON A STUDENT'S I EP OR FIVE OH FOR PLAN. BUT THEY WILL NOT BE IDENTICAL TO ACCOMMODATIONS PROVIDED FOR STUDENTS TAKING THE ASPECT. SOME OF THE IT ACCOMODATIONS ARE UNIQUE TO THE US BACK. BECAUSE ITS A COMPUTER TEST WHICH WILL NOT APPLY TO THE SAT OR ACT BECAUSE AGAIN IT IS NOT. A COMPUTER CHESS SO SOME OF THOSE WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT. ACCOMMODATIONS WILL BE EASIER TO COORDINATE. BECAUSE IT'S US IT'S THE TEST IS CONDUCTED AT THE SCHOOL SITE. THE REQUEST WILL BE HANDLED BY A SCHOOL STAFF BY SCHOOL STAFF OR COUNCIL RATHER THAN A PARENT NAVIGATING. THE PROCESS ALONG. WILL BE OUT ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENTS BE ALIGNED TO OUR STATE STANDARDS THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CONCERNS. PRESENTED. THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT. I WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE IS NO ONE TEST NOT EVEN THE ESPECTADOR THAT IS COMPLETELY ALIGNED TO THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS. EACH OF THE FIFTEEN CONCOURSE DATES MAY HAVE CHANGED OR ADDED TO THE STANDARDS BUT THE S. BACK AS THE SAME TEST. FOR ALL PARTICIPATING STATES. ANOTHER CONCERN. ARE THE SCORES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ELS STUDENTS INVALID FOR COLLEGE ADMISSIONS. NO BECAUSE THE ACCOMMODATIONS ARE WORKED OUT AND PLAN FOR AHEAD OF TIME. ANOTHER CONCERN. DOES THE ACHIEVE REPORT THERE'S A REPORT CALLED THE ACHIEVE REPORT RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL. ACHIEVE IS AFFILIATED WITH PARK ANOTHER COMMON CORE TEST IT HAS AVENGED VESTED INTERESTS OR THE ACHIEVED TASK BE ACHIEVED. REPORT. WAS ASSOCIATE WITH A COMPANY THAT GIVES ANOTHER. TEST. OR SO. A GROUP TO GET ANOTHER TEST IT ALSO NEGLECTED TO CITE FAVORABLE STUDIES TOWARDS OTHER TESTS. ANOTHER CONCERN CAN WE USE THE SAT FOR ACCOUNTABILITY PURPOSES. THERE IS DEFINITELY A WAY TO ALIGN THE SAT WITH THE S. BACK SCORES THROUGH CORDONED CONCURRENT CONCORDANCE STUDIES. WE CAN GET A SAT SCORE FOR EACH. S. BACK PERFORMANCE LEVEL YES WE CAN. MEMBERS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS AUTHORIZED BY FEDERAL LAW IN FACT A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES INCLUDING CONNECTICUT. DELAWARE ILLINOIS MAINE MICHIGAN HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ADMINISTER A COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM IN PLACE OF THE STATE ADOPTED TEST. THERE MAY BE A RELUCTANCE FOR THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE S. BACK BUT AGAIN. THE ASPECT NEVER MATURED INTO THE PRODUCT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE. WERE WAITING. I ASKED THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR OUR STUDENTS TODAY NOT LOYALTY TO SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE WE HELPED CREATED. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY ARE MISTER CHRIS STEIN HOUSE OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF THE LONG BEACH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. GLORIA AGUILAR SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND MELISSA BORDEAUX A SENIOR AT KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM HERE. SO WE HAVE. AN EXTRA WITNESS TODAY BUT THEY WERE GRANTED PERMISSION. BECAUSE THEY CAME IN HERE. WELL LET US LIVE. AYE MR STEIN HAS ROUGHLY OUT OF WHOEVER. ONE OF YOU GO. NOT FOR ME. VICE CHAIRMAN OF KILEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS HOW CAN YOU LIVE. PRIVILEGED TO BE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. OUT WE SERVE OVER FORTY THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS IN SEVENTY SEVEN SCHOOLS RIGHT HERE IN THE HEART OF SACRAMENTO. WE'VE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ON FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH. I WERE ALSO VERY DIVERSE SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH FORTY THREE LANGUAGES SPOKEN ON IN ANY OF THOSE SEVENTY SEVEN SCHOOLS. OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE IS RATHER SIMPLE AND IT STATES THAT WE ARE TO GIVE EVERY STUDENT AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO GRADUATE WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF POST SECONDARY CHOICES. FROM THE WIDEST ARRAY OF OPTIONS. THIS BILL THE PATHWAYS TO COLLEGE ACT WILL HELP US ACHIEVE THAT GUIDING PRINCIPLE BY ENSURING THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN FULFILL. THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM REQUIREMENTS THAT SO MANY OF OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE AS PART OF THEIR APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE ADMINISTERING THE SAT OR OTHER COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM. TO ALL ELEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS. WANT TO SHARE SOME DATA THAT I HOPE WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL AND HOW IT WILL HELP OUR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF GREATEST NEED. IN SACKS CITY CURRENTLY OF OUR CURRENT OF ARE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY NINE HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. ONLY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE. OR ABOUT NINETEEN PERCENT. HAD AN SAT OR ACT SCORE BY THE END OF THEIR JUNIOR YEAR. WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOL JUNIORS IN OUR DISTRICT. OF THE STUDENTS ONLY FIFTY FIVE OR TWO PERCENT HAD AN SAT OR ACT SCORE PRIOR TO YESTERDAY. MORE OVER WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS RIGHT NOW WHO ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE ATG. COLLEGE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA HOWEVER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE OF THEM WERE ABOUT TWENTY THREE PERCENT DID NOT TAKE THE S. EIGHTEEN. OR THE ACT BY DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THIS IS A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WERE ON TRACK FOR COLLEGE BUT DID NOT TAKE A COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM BY THE MIDPOINT OF THEIR SENIOR YEAR. OUR ELEVENTH GRADE COHORT CONSIST OF ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND AFTER FALL SEMESTER GRADES ARE CALCULATED ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY OF THEM ARE ON TRACK TO COMPLETE THE ATG COURSE PATTERN. BUT ONLY THIRTY FOUR. ONLY THIRTY FOUR HAVE AN S. C. T. ON RECORD OR ACT SCORE. YESTERDAY. ON APRIL TENTH WE OFFERED THE SAT TO EVERYONE OF THOSE TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED JUNIORS DURING THE SCHOOL DAY FOR FREE. YOU MAY ASK OURSELVES WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS PREVENTING STUDENTS FROM TAKING COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION WE SHOULD BE ASKING IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AND THE BILL THIS BILL IS ONE ANSWER IT WILL HELP BRING DOWN WHATEVER THE BARRIERS ARE THAT PREVENT STUDENTS FROM TAKING THE TEST BY OFFERING IT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. AND GIVING DISTRICTS LIKE SACKS CITY MORE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN CREATING A CULTURE THAT ALLOWS US TO ADMINISTER COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMS TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. CERTAINLY THIS BILL WILL HELP OUR DISTRICT AND EVERY OTHER DISTRICT IN THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE. A CHOICE FROM THOSE CHOICES OF OUR POST SECONDARY FROM THE WIDEST ARRAY OF OPTIONS. BEING ABLE TO USE THE S. A. T. OR THE ACT AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE STATE'S STANDARDIZED TESTS WILL BE A RELIEF FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS SO THEY MAKE FOCUS ON PREPARING STUDENTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND CAREER. PREPARATION. I THINK UP SIMPLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FOR INTRODUCING THE BILL ON HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL AGREE ON THE VALUE TO OUR STUDENTS OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. GOOD LUCK FINANCE PERSONAL SIR AND I'M THE. SUPERINTENDENT ALONG WITH UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I WON I THINK THE CHAIR IN. THE COMMITTEE ARE ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ALONG WITH UNIFIED HAS GIVEN THE AS THE TEARS AS HE'S T. US SCHOOL DAY FOR THREE YEARS. AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES BEFORE WE. GAVE THE SAT ARE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF MY STUDENTS ACTUALLY TOOK THE SAT LONG BEACH IS A VERY DIVERSE DISTRICT ARE EIGHTY SIX PERCENT MINORITY SEVEN PERCENT POVERTY. I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF MY SPECIAL ED STUDENTS TOOK THE TEST I'M ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT OF MY EMAIL STUDENTS TOOK THE TEST. AND ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF MY STUDENTS ON FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH TOOK THE TEST SINCE WE WERE GIVEN AT THE LAST THREE YEARS. ALL MY STUDENTS ARE TAKING THE TEST IN THE BEAUTY HAS BEEN THAT THERE IS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN STUDENTS MEETING COLLEGE CAREER READINESS STANDARDS ON THE ASPECT. AS WELL AS S. ET FOR EXAMPLE MOM BEACH LAST YEAR FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS MADE IT ON THE ASPECT FIFTY THREE PERCENT ON THE SEC. AND MATHEMATICS THIRTY TWO PERCENT ON THE ASPECT THIRTY ONE PERCENT AND ON THE S. ET. THE BEAUTY HERE IS THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IT WE GIVE FREE AS A CHEAPER TO ALL OF OUR JUNIORS IN EACH YEAR PROMISE OF THIRTY THREE OUR. SORRY PROGRAM LAS WHAT SEVEN SATURDAYS THIRTEEN HUNDRED JUNIOR SIGNED UP TO TAKE A TEST HUNDREDS OF KIDS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS. THE OTHER PIECE IS OUR COLLEGE AND ARE GOING RATE IS AROUND SEVENTY NINE PERCENT NOW LONG BEACH UNIFIED HAS AN EIGHTY SIX PERCENT GRAD RATE FOR EXAMPLE EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF MY AFTER AMERICANS ARE GRADUATING SCHOOL. WITH A GUN COLLEGE GOING RATE OF SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT AFTER THE FIRST YEAR MY STUDENTS ATTEND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY DIFFERENT COLLEGES WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS FOR OVER TEN YEARS. THE BEAUTY IS THAT WE REQUIRE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS TO LINK THEIR ARM THAT'S ET ACCOUNTS TO THE KHAN ACADEMY WHICH PROVIDES THEM FREE PERSONALIZED TUTORIALS. AND THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU CAN IMPROVE YOUR SAT SCORE IT TO GO TO THE CSU FOR THE CSU INDEX WHICH IS A VERY COMPLICATED FORMULA. IS. YOU HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR SAT SCORE YOU YOUR GPS SET BY THE END OF YOUR JUNIOR YEAR SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MY SENIORS TAKE THE SAT AGAIN. ON OUR DIME AS THE SENIORS AND THE BEAUTY HERE IS THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SENIORS WHO COULD HAVE GUARANTEED ADMISSION TO SEE ISSUE LOBBYIST BECAUSE THEIR INDEX IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE OTHER AND. UNIVERSITIES GET IN IN THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS A NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THOSE ARE STUDENTS OF COLOR WE CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR CONSERVING THIS BILL WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF OUR CHILDREN. THINK. MY NAME IS MOST EDUARDO I'M A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT. AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE BECAUSE AS A STUDENT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE ONE THING THAT WE ARE MISSING WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS IS PASSION IN OUR STUDENTS AND THE STUDENTS CAN FIND PASSION AND MOTIVATION IN THE THINGS THAT THEY. THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE POWER TO DO SO A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS THEY SEE THAT AS BACK TEST THAT THEY'RE GIVEN. AND THEY SEE IT AS A WORTHLESS TEST BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE GET NOTHING BACK FROM THAT TEST PERSONALLY AS STUDENTS SO STUDENTS WILL TAKE THAT TEST AND THEY WON'T TRY ON IT. AND THEY WILL CARE LESS ABOUT IT AND THEY WILL JUST WASTE THE SCHOOL DAY TAKING A TEST THAT ULTIMATELY DOES NOTHING FOR THEM BUT WHEN STUDENTS SEE THE SAT OR THE ACT. THEY SEE POTENTIAL MAY SEE AN OUTLET TO THOSE CAREERS IN THE SUCCESS THAT THEY ACTUALLY WISH THAT THEY CAN GO TO AND BY ADMINISTERING THIS TEST. FOR FREE ON CAMPUS STUDENTS DO NOT ONLY SEE THAT TEST BUT THEY SEE THE DOLLAR SIGNS ALONG WITH THAT TEST GO AWAY AND THEY SEE THAT OUT WOULD. COME DIRECTLY TO THEM AND A IT WOULD BE IT BLOWS MY MIND THAT JUST YESTERDAY WHEN WE HAVE AS A TWO DAY AT OUR CAMPUS ARE JUNIORS HAVE BEEN RUNNING AROUND FOR WEEKS. GOING TO TUTORING SESSIONS ASKING SING IS FOR A PRACTICE EXAMS AND EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS THE ONE TICKET THAT CAN GET THEM SO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GET TO IN THE WAY THAT THEY CAN. A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE MONEY A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE MOBILITY TO GET TO THESE EXAMS IN THE WAYS THAT THEY'VE BEEN ADMITTED BEFORE. AND THAT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING IN OFFERED TO THEM NOW YOU'RE SEEING FULL ADVANTAGE COME OUT OF THE STUDENTS AND YOU'RE SEEING FOR PASSION COME OUT OF THE STUDENTS AND I DEFINITELY BELIEVE. THAT WHEN THE SCORES COME BACK AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE SO MANY MORE JUNIORS WHO ARE GOING OFF TO BE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE. THAN WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN A LONG TIME AND SO I REITERATE MYSELF I I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT BY PUTTING FAITH BEHIND THIS BILL YOU'RE NOT ONLY PUTTING FAITH BEHIND THE BILL ITSELF BUT YOU ARE PUTTING FAITH. BEHIND THE FUTURE WITHIN OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. APPROACH TO MAKE BUT THE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION POSITION ON THE BILL.

UNFORTUNATELY OR HEARINGS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BELL I HAVE WITH ME MICHELLE CENTER ARE. DIRECTOR OF OUR ASSESSMENT DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHO SPEAK TO THE SUPERINTENDENT'S CONCERNS. GOOD AFTERNOON. WE ARE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG CONCERN AN URGE THAT YOU OPPOSE ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. IN DOING SO YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE COHERENT AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM. STANDARDS ASSESSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS NOW BEING USED IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WERE KEY TO IMPLEMENTING THIS AND TAKE THIS INTEGRATED SYSTEM. THAT HAS RELIABLE VALID AND FAIR ASSESSMENTS AT ITS CORE. FOR ASSESSMENT TO BE VALID THEY MUST HAVE A SOLID FOUNDATION OF ALIGNMENT TO CALIFORNIA STANDARDS THAT ARE BEING TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS. IN AN INDEPENDENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE HUMAN RESOURCES RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. THE SMARTER BALANCED HIGH SCHOOL ASSESSMENT RECEIVED AN EXCELLENT RATING FOR ITS MASKS TO MEASURING CONTENT MOST NEEDED FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. THISIS IN STARK CONTRAST TO STUDY THAT CONDUCTED THAT CONCLUDED THAT LESS THAN HALF OF THE SAT MATH ITEMS ALIGNED TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL COMMON CORE MATH STANDARDS. ADDITIONALLY. MICHAEL COHEN PRESIDENT OF ACHIEVE RECENTLY STATED IN REFERENCE TO THE ACT AND SAT. THAT THEIR LACK OF ALIGNMENT WITH STATE'S COLLEGE AND CAREER READY STANDARDS MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ASSESSMENTS TO BE USED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY PURPOSES. FOR ASSESSMENT TO BE FAIR THEY MUST OFFER STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE LEARNING ENGLISH. THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEY KNOW AND CAN DO. EVEN IF THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WOULD ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT AN ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT WITH LESS ACCESSIBILITY SUPPORTS. OR WITH A MORE BURDENSOME REQUESTING PROCESS. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE THE ACCESS THAT THEY NEED. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND SLIPS. SOME GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION MY NAME IS JENNIFER PETTY AN ENGLISH TEACHER IN ORANGE IN A FIVE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. AND THIS IS ALSO MY FIFTH YEAR AS CHAIR OF CTA'S STANDING COMMITTEE ON ASSESSMENT TESTING. ON BEHALF OF CTA I'M SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE ASSOCIATIONS OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. CD BILLY'S LEADERS AT BOTH THE DISTRICT AND STATE LEVEL SHOULD CONSIDER THIS OPTION AS PART OF A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS OF CREATING A HIGH QUALITY IN BALLOT SYSTEM OF ASSESSMENT. SEE IF YOU BELIEVE THAT IN REGARD TO REPLACING THE STATE APPROVED A GRADE ELEVEN ASSESSMENTS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS LITERACY AND MATHEMATICS. THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. YOU TO APPROVE A REQUEST BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION TO ADMINISTER AN ALTERNATE ASSESSMENT SUCH AS NATIONAL RECOGNIZE ASSESSMENTS RECONNAISSANCE MINTS. GIVEN THE CURRENT FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE SSA CRITERIA FOR PUTTING SUCH TESTS SHALL INCLUDE BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO. PEER REVIEW THE STATE MUST SUBMIT EVIDENCE FOR PEER REVIEW TO DOCUMENT THAT THE RECOMMENDED TESTING PROGRAM AS VARIOUS COMPONENTS MEET REQUIREMENTS FOR VALIDITY RELIABILITY AND FAIRNESS. I'M INCLUDING IN SUPPORT MY TESTIMONY A MAP THAT YOU AT THE HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO YOU THAT LAYS OUT THE CRITICAL ELEMENTS. OF THE PEER REVIEW WHICH THIS BILL WAVES THERE ARE FOUR CRITICAL ELEMENTS. OF THOSE THE SENATE CRITICAL ELEMENTS IN CLEAR BOXES WITH SOLID OUTLINES. ARE ONES THAT MAYBE SKIT IF REVIEW OF THESE ELEMENTS ALTOGETHER AS A PRIMARY REASON FOR CITIES OBJECTION TO THE BILL. ALIGNMENT TO THE STATE ADOPTED STANDARDS SEE BELIEVES STATE. THE STATE MUST CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THE ALIGNMENT OF THE RECOMMENDED TEST AS MY AS MICHELLE'S UNDERSTATED. TO THE STATE'S ADOPTED CONTENTS ENTERS THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF CALIFORNIA'S ADOPTED A COMMON CORE STATE STANDARDS THE REVIEW FROM THE STATE MUST PROVIDE DOCUMENTED CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THE RECOMMENDED TEST WAS DEVELOPED USING A PROCESS. TO THE NEEDS OF ASSESSING THAT STATE STANDARDS. FAIRNESS TO ALL STUDENTS CT BELIEVE THE RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDED TESTS SHOULD PROVIDE VALID AND RELIABLE MEASUREMENT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF PERFORMANCE. OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW PERFORMING THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND STUDENTS WHO WERE ENGLISH LEARNERS IS HAS ABILITY FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO WERE ENGLISH LEARNERS AND OR HAVE A DISABILITY. CT DEPLETE BELIEVES THE RECOMMENDED TEST MUST PROVIDER USE THE SAME SET OF SUPPORTS AT MINIMUM AND ACCOMMODATIONS PROVIDED BY STATE SANCTIONS ASSESSMENTS. OF CITY BELIEVES RECOMMENDED TEST MUST BE REVIEWED USING THE STANDARD SETTING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES PERFORMANCE LEVEL DESCRIPTORS BASED ON THE STATE'S STANDARDS. WE HAVE BEEN CONTACTING TEACHERS AND TEACHER LEADERS IN THE DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL AS SUPPORTING THIS BILL BILL ANALYSIS AS SUPPORTING THIS BILL. SO FAR THE LOCAL ASSOCIATION LEADERSHIP IN ALBERT BEAUMONT BRAILLE LINDA CHINO VALLEY DUBLIN HELMET LYNN WOULD OAKLAND ORANGE SAN JOSE SAN DIEGO AND SANTA CLARA HAVE ALL STATED TO US THAT THERE DISTRICT LEADERSHIP HAS NEVER CONTACTED POLICE TRAFFIC ABOUT SUPPORTING THE IDEAS AND WAS DONE IN THIS BILL. AND FOR THE REASONS I'VE OUTLINED IT WILL NOT SUPPORT THE BILL AS WRITTEN. THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY YEARS THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS TO ASSURE THE PARTICULAR ASSESSMENT AND SENSIBILITY NEEDS OF STUDENTS DISABILITIES AND LISTENERS ARE ADDRESSED. WHILE THERE ARE MANY OTHER CONCERNS WITH THIS SORT CUTS IN THIS BILL THERE ARE MANY. MOST URGENT ISSUES SUCH AS SIMPLY AS THE BILL SHOULD ADDRESS FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF BORIC OUR CONCERNS ASK YOUR NO VOTE ON AB NINETEEN FIFTY ONE AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AT ARLINGTON REESE YOU RETIRED SPECIAL ED TEACHER AFTER THIRTY SIX YEARS SECONDS S. ECONOMIC LACKEY HIGH SCHOOL.

AMONG THE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL TO THE LACK OF ADDRESSING ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS FOR NOT JUST THE EL AL. SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY TIME. THOSE ARE NOT ALLOWED WITH ACCOMMODATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS THAT DIFFERENT WE URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. EVELYN APPLE HASN'T DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SUBMITTED A LETTER OF OPPOSITION JUST REALLY BRIEFLY WE WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL HOLD STUDENT WITH DISABILITIES TO A LOWER STANDARD THAN MY FEDERAL LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES RUN THESE TESTS. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COMMENDATIONS ISSUE IN ENSURING THAT ACCOMMODATION NEEDS ARE ACTUALLY. MATT AND WHOSE COULD ENFORCE THE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THE BILL REFERENCES I'M REQUIREMENTS ABOUT IT A BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE AYE BEFORE PLANS DO THEY GET ACCOMMODATED AS WELL. BUT THERE'S MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THE LANGUAGES AND CLEAR FOR OPEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS BUT AS THE BILL STAND RIGHT NOW WERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. MARTHA CERRITOS IDEAS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. AND I JUST WANTED A CLARIFICATION WITH REGARD TO THE AMENDMENTS DID YOU STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. O'DONNELL THAT THERE WERE GOING TO BE ACCOMMODATIONS BUT SPECIFIC TO THE EYEPIECE AND PRIVATE FORESTS. I I'LL THAT. O'DONNELL I POTENTIALLY ADDRESS THAT ACTUALLY MEANT THAT YOU OPEN IT TO MEMBERS COMMITTEE THANK YOU HOPE OKAY WELL OUR CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT WE SEEK AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. WITH REGARDS TO ACCOMMODATIONS TO ENGLISH LEARNERS. SPECIFICALLY THOSE ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO ARE NOT YET ENGLISH PROFESSIONS HOW WILL THEY BE ABLE TO TAKE THE ESSAY. THE ESSAY T. D. S. BACK PROVIDES IS. APPROPRIATE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THOSE ENGLISH LEARNERS ALSO HOW DOES THIS BILL AFFECT ENGLISH LEARNERS AND BILINGUAL PROGRAMS THESE ARE THE CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED TO. BE AUTHOR AND WE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THEM THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MANY MEMBERS OF THE. THE DOCTOR WEBER. YEAH. OKAY THIS IS NOT ONLY EVER HEARD FROM YOU TODAY MY MONEY GO FIRST. WELL I I CAN CLOSE. HOUSE AND ASK YOU CLOSE NO ACTUALLY I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALGARY. MY I THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD MEASURE AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT. I AM SENSITIVE TO THOSE WHO'VE ASKED ABOUT HOW ACCOMMODATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN. FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOR OTHERS YOU JUST ADDRESS THEM WHEN WHENEVER YOU ARE MAKING YOUR. WELL THE QUESTION THE I IS ELECTED BEEN ASKED OF A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS YEAH ARE THEY GOING TO BE ACCOMMODATIONS THE ANSWER IS YES IF WE NEED TO WORK WITH. WITH. SOMEONE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC. ON SO AMENDMENT CERTAINLY WILLING TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT THE INTENT IS ABSOLUTELY TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR THOSE WHO NEED THEM. DOCTOR OR. I WAS GOING TO. WELL ONE OF THOSE MY QUESTIONS WAS THAT BUT. THE OTHER ONE. IT EVIDENTLY THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ALREADY IMPLEMENT THIS IN LONG BEACH AND IN SACKS. YOU'RE ALREADY DOING IT. AND YOU DOING THE OTHER EXAMS WELL. SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO BOTH. AND THAT'S MY CONCERN BECAUSE I'M A TRUE FOR OF READY TO JUST DROP IT AND MOVE. AND I WANT THOSE WHO DECIDE TO DROP BUT I DON'T SEE ANY REQUIREMENTS HERE TO REALLY DO. THOUGH THE REAL HARD WORK THAT YOU CAN DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IN OTHER WORDS YOU KNOW IT'S ONE THING TO SAY OKAY YOU GUYS COULD NOT TAKE THE SAT. OR THE A CTU WHATEVER THAT ON TAPE. BUT THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GET STUDENTS TO THAT POINT IS CRITICAL. IN THE SUCCESS OF THOSE EXAMS. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN DO IT. OR THE SAY OKAY THIS WILL GET OUR KIDS IN COLLEGE BECAUSE IT WON'T. IF THERE'S NOT PREPARATION FAR IN ADVANCE TO HAVE THE STUDENTS BE SUCCESSFUL. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN. ANNA AND NOBODY PUTS HIS COLLEGE MORE TO ME AND ME NOT ALWAYS CRITICIZED BECAUSE YOU SAY YOU YOU WANT EVERYBODY TO GO TO COLLEGE YES YES I DO IN AND AND SO AS A RESULT I ALWAYS GET CRITICIZED BECAUSE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH. WHATEVER CT  <u><c.green>IN</c></u> THIS IN THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE I FIGURED FOLKS CAN DO THAT AS WELL. SOME ALWAYS PUSHING THE COLLEGE PIECE THAT SURVEYOR BUT ALSO KNOW THAT I'VE HAD STUDENTS WHEREBY SAFETY NET YOU NEED TO TAKE THEIR SAFETY. AND THEY TAKE IT AND THEY DON'T DO WELL BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THE S. A. T. IS A LIFE JOURNEY ALMOST TO GET TO THE POINT WE'RE GOING TO DO WELL AND IT. IS NOT SOMETHING YOU DECIDED TO IN ELEVENTH GRADE. AND IT HAS TO BE A LOT OF PREPARATION IN ADVANCE TO TO TAKE THAT THAT EXAM AND DO WELL ON IT. I AM SO I'VE SEEN STUDENTS EVEN GOOD STUDENTS WHO'VE TAKEN AND NOT DONE WELL. IN A BEEN CRUSHED BY BY THE SCORES AT AT THE IT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE GPA AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO IT AND AND. I THINK THERE'S VALUE IN INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO TAKE THE EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PRE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE PRIOR TO POST BE JUST SAY WE WILL TAKE THE SAT. I'M ONE YOU DISTRICTS REALIZE THAT IF THEY DECIDE TO GO THAT THERE'S NOTHING. I DIDN'T SEE EVEN MAYBE IT'S YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT WAS SAYS IN ORDER FOR YOU TO. S. NOTE TO MAKE THIS TO MAKE THE SLEEP YOU HAVE TO HAVE DONE THIS THIS WORK WAS HARD WORK BUT MOST OF YOU'VE DONE. I KNOW LONG WE JUST A LOT OF HARD WORK TO GET TO THE POINT WITH OUR STUDENTS ARE TAKING THAT EXAM DOING WELL AND BEING AND HIGH PERCENT OF THEM POINT COLLEGE. A LOT OF THEM HAVE DONE THAT I'VE SEEN LOTS OF SCHOOLS WHO PUSHED THE SAT. IN INNER CITIES AND THE KIDS TAKE IT. AND THEY DON'T DO WELL AND THEY DON'T GO TO COLLEGE OR THEY MAY THE PATERNITY BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE ENDED UP ANYWHERE WITHOUT. EVEN WITHOUT THE TEST SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOME ALMOST FEEL LIKE I'M IN A RUSH TO JUDGMENT WITH REGARDS TO. THE A FULL BILL THAT REALLY SAYS I SHOULD GET RID OF THIS TEST. AND. AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW ALL MOVE ON TO THESE OTHERS THAT AT THE I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE S. A. T. IS CHANGED SINCE I TOOK IT. THOUSAND YEARS AGO. AND THAT IS CHANGE EVEN SINCE MY KIDS TOOK IT OUT TO TRY TO ALIGN ITSELF WITH THAT. BUT I I YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA GETS INTO THIS THING SOMETIMES WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT AND THEN WE FLIP OVER GO TO SOMETHING ELSE AND IT WOULD GO SOMETHING ELSE AND SOMETHING ELSE. IN THE PANTS A TOTALLY CONFUSED AS TO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AND WHERE THE NOT YOU KNOW IT IT IT WHETHER THE ASSESSMENTS ARE REALLY INFORMING NOT ONLY HOW WELL KIDS ARE DOING. BUT INFORMING OUR INSTRUCTION AS WELL BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT ALSO BE DOING AS WELL INFORMING US ABOUT OUR INSTRUCTION WHERE WE NEED TO GO. SO I JUST LIKE THERE'S A LOT MORE CONVERSATION THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THIS SOME PADDED TOWARD I MAY VOTE FOR JUST TO GET IT. MORE CONVERSATION. GIVE IT TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT I'M GET ALL THE ANSWERS AYE AYE HABIT CONCERNING THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A LOT OF WILL GOAL. AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THOSE FOLKS ARE DOING IT. AND ARE DOING IT ALREADY. WITH THE OTHER TEST THERE I MEAN I KNOW SOME FOLKS SAY ALL MY GOD WOULD HEAL TO KIDS TAKE A LOT OF TESTS. BUT ALWAYS REMIND FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO UNIVERSITY YOU TAKE SIX SEVEN TESTS IN ONE WEEK SOMETIMES DON'T FINALS WEEK IN THE SAME THING IN MIDTERM. SO IF YOU REALLY GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE BIG EACH ACT TOGETHER ON THE TEST AND STORY BECAUSE IS COMMON OKAY. BUT UP BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT THAT THE HARD WORK THAT WOULD WE HAVE ENOUGH IN HERE TO THE SAYS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THIS HARD WORK AND THE HARD WORK BEGINS BEFORE THE ELEVENTH GRADE. AND IBM'S VERY EARLY FOR STUDENTS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THIS TEST AND TO DO WELL ON IT AND HAVE IT REFLECT YOU KNOW THE ASPIRATIONS TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ARM. I DON'T KNOW IT IT JUST IT I HAVE COME SOME CONCERNS AND I APPLAUD THE IDEA AND THOSE OF YOU IN OF THE DISTRICTS WHO DONE IT. BUT I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THE HARD WORK YOU'VE DONE BY SEA AND EVERYBODY ELSE CAN DO IT. YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU FOLKS HAVE MADE GREAT INVESTMENTS IN THIS EFFORT I KNOW LONG WE TAKE AS AN AND NO SEX STATE IS NOW MAKING GREAT INVESTMENTS. IN THIS EFFORT OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE SAT AND TO HAVE THE KIND OF RESULTS THAT YOU WANT FOR USE FOR THE KIDS. MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAVE ONE OF THE SUPER TENNIS RESPONDED THAT QUESTION BUT YOU WHAT I SAID ABOUT. AND THAT IS THE WORD ASSESSMENT. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE WHAT THE US BACK SYSTEM IF YOU WILL. IS THAT IT'S MORE OF A SUMMATIVE TEST THAT IT IS AN ASSESSMENT AND MOVE THE SUPERINTENDENT WILL SPEAK TO THIS BUT YOU CAN START THE EIGHTH GRADE AND THAT THERE IS YOUR ASSESSMENT. TASKS SHORT TREATMENT GAPS ASSESSMENTS HELP US CLOSE THEM THAT MAYBE ONE OF THE SUPER TENANTS COULD RESPOND TO A QUESTION. THANK YOU. I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT IS IS THE IT'S ABOUT ASSESSMENT IT'S ABOUT IT'S GOING TO START EARLY AND I WOULD ARGUE IT STARTS AS EARLY AS PRESCHOOL AND SO. SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN LONG BEACH I'M ALL OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TAKE THE PS EIGHTEEN GRADE EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN THAT CITY IN GRADE ELEVEN AND TWELVE. AND WE HAVE THESE CAREER. AT COLLEGES. IN READING THIS GUIDES THAT STUDENTS GET TWICE A YEAR STARTING THE EIGHTH GRADE TO DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOCTOR WEBER TALK ABOUT PROGRESS TALK ABOUT THEM GOALS TALK ABOUT INTERVENTIONS. IN THE BEAUTY IS THAT OUR TEACHERS HAVE USE THIS INFORMATION TO ABOUT CORD MAP SO FOR EXAMPLE WHAT KISSING TO BE. ABLE TO SEE THE SUCCESS ONE ALGEBRA TWO BACKWARD MAPPING ONLY DOWN TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PASSPORT ON THE OTHER PIECE OUR OUR COLLEGE PARTNERS HAVE TOLD US WHY WE NOW REQUIRE FOUR YEARS OF MATHEMATICS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A STUDENT IS IN COLLEGE READY. ON THE SAT THEN THEY ARE PUT IN A. CREDIT RECOVERY COURSE FOR EITHER THE GOING TO JUNIOR COLLEGE OR THE GOING TO ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES THAT GETS RID OF REMEDIATION SO WE HAVE AROUND SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS RIGHT NOW WE'RE TAKING REMEDIAL COURSES ON OUR DIME. TO DO THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE WERE OFFERING COLLEGE MATH IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR THERE. FROM CSU LONG BEACH WITH THE STUDENTS CAN TAKE OUT AND GET RID OF IT SO YOU'RE AND AS YOU KNOW. IDEA C. T. OR THE ACT IS A REQUIREMENT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE POST SECONDARY CHOICES. ABOUT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE PUT IN THE EFFORT THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED UP FOR US TO ORGANIZE THIS WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE ACCOMMODATIONS QUESTIONS AND AS MELISSA JUST MENTIONED. THAT WE BEGIN TO CREATE A CULTURE WHERE STUDENTS BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS. WHAT THEY HAVE TO START GETTING USED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE CHOICES? THANK YOU I THINK YOU BOTH PROBABLY ANSWERED MY QUESTION IS WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS UP BUT ONLY BECAUSE. ONLY BECAUSE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK PARTICULAR IN LONG BEACH. WHICH HAS BEEN A MODEL OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR A LONG TIME WITH THE PSE AND MOVING IT FORWARD SO THAT. YOU DOING THE ASSESSMENT EARLY IN THE GAME WHEN YOU'RE DOING THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT BRING THAT BRING YOU TO THE SAT. LA ELEVENTH GRADE RATHER THAN THE LEVIN GREAT YOU DO AN ESSAY T. AND. ALL THE OTHER STUFF IS NOT THE OR SO I DON'T YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY TORN WITH THIS. LIKE I SAID I MADE JUST TO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU TO PUSH THE CONVERSATION FORWARD. BUT I'M OUT BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT. IT DOESN'T BECOME ANOTHER SHINY OBJECT TO US IN THE IN THE STATE. THAT THE HARD WORK THAT IS DONE THE CHIU M. INDICATING IS NOT JUST US PASSING THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO DO IT. IT'S REALLY MAKING SURE OF THOSE WHO DECIDE TO DO IT UNDERSTAND A WHOLE PACKAGE THIS THE AIR AND NOT JUST THE CHANGE FROM ONE TEST TO THE OTHER. THAT THERE ARE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO IT AND I RESPECT THE WORK THAT HAPPENS I KNOW WOULD LONG BEACH DOES. I RESPECT THAT HARD WORK THIS THERE AND THE QUESTION BECOMES WHETHER NOT THAT'S GOING TO BE. INCORPORATED IN SOMETHING HERE THAT DEMANDS THIS LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING AND THE HARD WORK THAT HAS TO OCCUR. BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I KNOW SOME FOLKS WHO DO IT AND SOME FOLKS WHO DO THE SHINY OBJECT. AND. AND IN THE END WE WON'T SEE NECESSARY THE KIND OF RESULTS WE WANT WE CHANGE TESTING WE WILL NOT SEE MORE STUDENTS BEING SUCCESSFUL IN GOING TO COLLEGE WILL HAVE THE BILL THAT THIS THE DISCOURSE. AND ACT SCORES BUT THEY MAY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT WOULD GET THEM INTO ANYBODY'S COLLEGE TO HELP THEM IN THAT PROCESS OF THAT SO THERE WILL BE A CHECK OFF THE BOX. IF THEY GOT GREAT GPAS DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT THEY TAKE IN THIS CITY SO THAT'S MY THAT'S MY CONCERN AND UP. I APPRECIATE IT AND I AND I'M HERE WITH YOU SAYING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THIS CITIES SOMEONE TOLD ME THE CHANGE AND ALL THAT GOOD ASSESSMENT BETTER CARS. BUT I DON'T JUST WANT US TO BE CHANGING TO BE CHANGING AND NOT HAVE. THE OF THE BREASTS OF THE WORK THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE DONE OUGHT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. MR DOT OBJECT CLOSE. OH YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST BE CLEAR THAT THE PURPOSE. OF THIS BILL ARE SIMPLE. OTHER CLEAR AT ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THAT THE DISTRICTS ASIDE WHAT ASSESSMENT IS BEST FOR THEIR STUDENTS BUT. THERE MUST BE AN ASSESSMENT. THE SAT IS MORE MEANINGFUL TO STUDENTS IT MEANS A LOT MORE THEY ARE INVESTED IN. IT WILL INCREASE COLLEGE GOING RATES INSURES THAT STUDENTS TAKE A COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAM. SAT IS MORE OF AN ASSESSMENT NOT JUST A TEST WE DISCUSS THAT. IT'S ONE LESS TASK THAT ELEVENTH GRADER HAS TO TAKE IN YOU'VE GOT UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU GIVE THE ASPECTHAST ON A SCHOOL SITE THE LOGISTICS ARE PRETTY INCREDIBLE YOU HAVE TO MOVE CLASSES YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE DAY YOU HAVE TO BRING IT OFTEN. SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS SOME TEST ADVISORS FROM FROM THE FROM THE DISTRICT LEVEL TO REALLY GET THE DAY MOVING AND GET THE TEST TAKEN AND YOU GOT TO CAPTURE THE KIDS THAT WEREN'T THERE SO IT'S A. HUGE LOGISTICAL VENTURE AS WELL ALL THE SIMPLE VICE THAT YOU KNOW THE S. C. A. S. R. ALLOW STATES TO AUTHORIZE SCHOOL DISTRICTS USE A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HIGH SCHOOL ASSESSMENT. AND WE SEEK TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION THROUGH THIS BILL THIS BILL IS ABOUT EQUITY. AN OPPORTUNITY AND I ASK FOR YOUR IDOL. I THANK YOU TO ALL WHO ARE OFFERED YOUR INPUT TO OUR SUPERINTENDENTS FOR THE GREAT EXAMPLE YOU PROVIDED IN PARTICULAR TO OUR VERY ELOQUENT AT KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. THIS IS A WONDERFUL JOB.

FORTY PERCENT OF AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE AT RISK FOR SCHOOL FAILURE DUE TO POVERTY RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IMMIGRATION LANGUAGE BARRIERS. LIVING IN A SINGLE PARENT FAMILY AND PARENTS WITH LITTLE EDUCATION OR HEALTH PROBLEMS ABOUT NINETEEN PERCENT OR ONE IN FIVE OF ALL CHILDREN SEEN BY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. HOW BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS BUT FEW RECEIVE HELP IN FACT FEWER THAN ONE IN FIVE NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACTUALLY RECEIVED THEM? IN THE SCHOOLS SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS HELP TEACHERS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES OVERCOME BARRIERS TO LEARNING SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS ARE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES THAT PROMOTE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL IT JUST BEEN. IN SCHOOL AND IN SOCIETY. SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS ALSO HELP CONNECT STUDENTS TO CRITICAL SUPPORT SPACE SUCH AS HOUSING FOR HOMELESS STUDENT. IN ADDITION SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS CAN HELP REDUCE ABSENCES AND DROP OUTS BY PROVIDING CONFLICT RESOLUTION AN ANGER MANAGEMENT SKILLS HELPING STUDENTS LEARN SOCIAL SKILLS.

THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT FEWER MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS AND WILL BE NEEDED TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN OUR STATE. AND WE LOOK AT SERVICES PROVIDED WITHIN SCHOOLS WE KNOW THAT THE SERVICES. ARE OFTEN TO DIE FIRST TO BE CUT WHEN SOCIAL WORKERS ARE INVOLVED THE BENEFITS OF EARLY INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ISSUES AT SCHOOL AND THE LONG TERM MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS THE INTERVENTION CAN PROVIDE ARE INVALUABLE. THE SERVICES CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED IF THE APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL ARE EMPLOYED BY SCHOOLS AND WE ENCOURAGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONTRACT WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS WE BELIEVE AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY EIGHT WILL SUPPORT THE BIG PEDRO HEALTH WORKFORCE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND PROBABLY BEFORE YOU TO PRESENT AB TWO FOUR SEVEN ONE. THIS BILL. WILL ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S. NEED FOR MORE STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES IT WILL ESTABLISH GRANTS THAT INCREASE THE DELIVERY OF SUPPORT SERVICES AND THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE SERVICES WITHIN THE ENTIRE SCHOOL AT MANY SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THE PROGRAM ESTABLISHES GRANTS THAT WILL LEVERAGE FELT FEDERAL DOLLARS IN DRAWDOWN MORE RESOURCES. AND IT WILL ENABLE US TO HAVE IMPORTANT RESOURCES IN OUR SCHOOLS LIKE NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS. THE BILL DOES HAVE. A FUNDING STREAM OF THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO BRING NEEDED RESOURCES INTO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND WE HAVE SOME WITNESSES WHO WISH TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL. TESTIMONY TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR THAT I AM PLEASED TO WELCOME HELEN DOWDEN FROM THE TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS ALLIANCE IN ON OUR HOUSE WE BOUGHT FROM THE NIGHT WAY OF CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I'M HELEN ROSS DOWDEN FROM TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS THIS BILL IS BASED UPON A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN COLORADO. WHERE THEY TOOK THEIR CANNABIS MONEY IN THE YEARS TO TO PROVIDE A SCHOOL COUNSELOR PSYCHOLOGIST? ON A SOCIAL WORKERS SCHOOL NURSES UP FOR PROGRAMS IN THE SCHOOLS USING CANNABIS MONEY AND IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL THEY'VE SEEN. OUR REDUCTION THEY'VE SEEN SOME REAL AFFECT ON MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. ALSO DECIDE CANNABIS MONEY SINCE IT'S COMES FROM AN INITIATIVE THAT CAN'T BE MATCHED WITH FEDERAL MONEY IT CAN PROVIDE A FISH A. FIFTY PERCENT MATCH TO BRING MEDI CAL MONEY DOWN. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT AS OF JULY OF THIS YEAR THAT WILL ALLOW SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE CYCLE A PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO THIS MONEY WOULD PROVIDE THE MATCH SO RATHER THAN HAVE HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION BY DOING IT THIS WAY AND. IT WOULD BE AND A LOT OF THIS PROGRAM IS ALREADY IN PLACE BASED ON WHAT COLORADO HAS DONE SO WE COULD REALLY. ADAPTED QUICKLY AND USE IT FOR SCHOOLS A SUPPORT SERVICES THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION OF POSITION ON THE BILL. HOW I THINK WHEN WE HAVE A SECOND ONE GUY HAD AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THE LINE THANK YOU I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF? GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ON A HASSELBLAD I'M WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA UNITED WAY'S FIGHTS FOR THE HEALTH EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL STABILITY OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN EVERY COMMUNITY. WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN AS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANT NEXUS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS AN UNEVEN TRACK RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRATING CARE BETWEEN SCHOOLS HEALTH PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORTS AND SERVICES AS A RESULT MANY STUDENTS ARE FALLING BETWEEN THE CRACKS. THIS IMBALANCE CAN BE SEEN PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH OR FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNING. CONSIDERING THAT NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE BUT AS WE SADLY NO COVERAGE DOES NOT EQUAL ACCESS. TO CARE AND TOO MANY CHILDREN DO NOT RECEIVE RECEIVE THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THEY NEED EARLY IN LIFE THIS IS WHERE AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE OFFERS A SMART SOLUTION CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES DESERVE ACCESSIBLE INTEGRATED COORDINATED SERVICES THEIR SCHOOLS TO ACHIEVE THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL. AND THIS BILL WOULD FOLLOW THE INTENT OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOURS USE EDUCATION PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT ACCOUNT AND PROVIDING TARGETED GRANTS TO SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT STUDENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE CREATES UNNECESSARY MECHANISM BY WHICH GRANTS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES CAN BE DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WITH HEIDI POPULATIONS. WE KNOW FROM OUR WORK ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT WRAPPING CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THEY NEED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE DRAMATICALLY ALTERED THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES FOR THE BETTER. THE SCHOOLS MANY TIMES THE CENTER COMMUNITIES WHERE WE CAN MOST EFFECTIVELY INTERVENE. ADDITIONALLY AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE DRAWS FROM ROBUSTLY EVALUATED SCHOOL BASED COORDINATE CARE MODELS LIKE THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE FOR THESE REASONS. WE AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY ONE IS A BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR PROVIDING SCHOOL BATES COORDINATED CARE. AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THINK YOU.

WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AS WAS STATED BY THE AUTHOR AB TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN WOULD PROVIDE A GRANT PROGRAM WOULD ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM. FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OR EXPANSION OF EXISTING DUAL LANGUAGE OR A DEVELOPMENTAL DEVELOPMENTAL BILINGUAL PROGRAMS. WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS. GRANT PROGRAM IS THAT IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS FOR OUR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE A SORELY NEEDED. START UP FUNDS FOR. OUR OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR CONSORTIA THIS NEEDED TO PROVIDE NEEDED TO CREATE ADDITIONAL PATHWAYS TO BUY LITERACY. FROM PRESCHOOL TO TWELFTH GRADE. OTHER START UP FUNDS WOULD ALLOW SCHOOLS TO USE THESE RESOURCES IN AN EFFECTIVE AND QUALITY MANNER FOR THESE PROGRAMS. TO INCLUDE OF THE ABILITY TO DO SUCH AS. OF. TEACHER BILINGUAL TEACHER RECRUITMENT THE PROVISION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS IN VARIOUS FOREIGN LANGUAGES. AS WELL AS TEACHER COACHES. ONCE THE PROGRAMS ARE ESTABLISHED THEY WOULD BE SUSTAINED WITH EXISTING RESOURCES SUCH AS VLC AT THAT. AND FEDERAL FUNDING WE KNOW WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE ARE WITH REGARDS TO BILINGUALISM AND MULTI LINGUAL IS SO. THERE IS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH REGARDING THE ADVANTAGES. BRAIN AND COGNITIVE ACADEMIC ECONOMIC AND STRONGER FAMILY COHESION AND HERITAGE CONNECTION. SPECIFICALLY DUAL LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS BENEFIT NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS WHO DEVELOP SKILLS IN THE NATIVE LANGUAGE WITH NO NEGATIVE IMPACT. ON THEIR ENGLISH SKILLS NTL I PROGRAMS ALSO ASSIST IN THE NARROWING OF THE A ACHIEVEMENT GAP OF ENGLISH LEARNERS. AS WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE STATE SEAL OF BY LITERACY AND OUR HE'LL LAY AND HE'LL DE FRAMEWORK. CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE NATION IN CREATING BILINGUAL PATHWAYS FOR ALL STUDENTS.

DUAL LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS DEVELOPMENTAL BILINGUAL PROGRAMS FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND EARLY LEARNING TOOL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ARE PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED TO SEE. EARLY LEARNING INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. MANY STUDIES INCLUDING IN THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES CLEARLY SHOWS THE BENEFITS OF BILINGUALISM. TO INCLUDE LONG TERM ECONOMIC SOCIAL ACADEMIC AND COGNITIVE BENEFITS AND ALSO HOPE TO COULD. TO CLOSE A CHEAP ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME OF STUDENTS. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT ALL CHILDREN ARE WIRED TO LEARN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT THE BRAIN IS MOST RECEPTIVE TO LEARNING A LANGUAGE IN THE EARLIEST YEARS OF LIFE. AND THAT THE HOME LANGUAGE IS REALLY FOUNDATIONAL FOR ENGLISH PROFICIENCY FOR SOCIAL AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT. AND FOR OVERALL ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR PROPOSITION FIFTY EIGHT WAS A BIG SIGNAL FROM OUR FAMILIES THAT THEY WANT BY LEGAL PATHWAYS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. LARA AND SO THEY NEED SUPPORT LAST YEAR THE STATE GENEROUSLY PROVIDED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE A NEW BILINGUAL TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS. EIGHT. ELEAZAR RECEIVE THE FUNDING BUT THERE WERE FIFTY ONE LETTERS OF INTENT SO THAT'S A BIG SIGNAL OF THE KIND OF SUPPORT THE DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING FOR. WE ARE EXCITED THE DISTRICTS LIKE LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH UNIFIED ARE BEGINNING TO IMPLEMENT NEW DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS IN THEIR EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS. AND THEY TO NEED SUPPORT TO BUILD. THAT THEIR CAPACITY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE'RE EXCITED. TO SEE AB TWENTY FIVE FOURTEEN AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE START UP FUNDING THAT WOULD SUPPORT FAMILIES TO WORK WITH THEIR SCHOOLS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THESE DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS.

THANK YOU PLEASE CALLTHE ROLL TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL AYE KILEY AYE KILEY AYE KALRA. MCCARTY STEINORTH. THURMOND. THURMAN THURMOND AYE WEBER WEBER AYE. VOTES IT'S A LOSS FOR VOTED IS OUT AND MINIATURE ORDER MISTER CAR THEY WOULD THANK YOU ONE BILL THAT MR BONTA YOU CAN GO AND THEN I'LL PRESENT THE REST OF MY MISTER CHAIR ARE YOU READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FOR SURE. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FUNDING FOR THE EQUALIZATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL SERVICES. AND FOR HIGH COST PLACEMENTS. OUR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS DESERVE A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. BUT ARE CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING SYSTEM PRESENTS BARRIERS WHERE THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY. FROM FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS TO NINE HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS PER PUPIL FOR REALLY NO LOGICAL REASON. IN FACT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE FUNDING THAT THE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE FUNDING DATE. TO AN INFORMAL SURVEY OF EXPENDITURES CONDUCTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LIVING WITHIN THESE AND IT WOULD SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THESE INEQUITIES FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS IN ADDRESSING THEM IS SO IS A SIMPLE MATTER OF FAIRNESS. FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL ALSO PRESENTS A BARRIER WHERE THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY AT A CRITICAL TIME IN CHILDREN'S LIVES. CALIFORNIA'S SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A FREE AND APPROPRIATE. PUBLIC EDUCATION TO PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. BUT IN SPITE OF THIS MANDATE NO STATE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THIS IS SHORTSIGHTED BECAUSE AN EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FOR PRESCHOOLERS ARE AN EXCELLENT. INVESTMENT FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDES FOR ADDITIONAL SWAT FINDINGS TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. WHEN OUR CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED WE HAD SUCH AN ALLOWANCE. BUT WAS ELIMINATED DURING THE RECESSION LEAVING SCHOOLS WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIGHER COSTS. PLACEMENTS. ALL OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS BILL ARE COMMON SENSE INVESTMENTS AND FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY FOR OUR VALUED STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF TEMPLAR PURSUER INTENT OF GROSSMONT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND MICHAEL FLORES COST ANETA CHAIR OF THE SPENT CTA SPECIAL EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER TEACHER IN THE ARVIN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. MISTER MISTER COLOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR TIM LEBANON THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE GROSSMONT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE. SUPERINTENDENTS COUNSEL FOR THE EAST COUNTY SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREA OR THE SALPA. THAT SERVES OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND HAS AN ATA OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. ON BEHALF OF THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF THE STUDENTS WOULD BE DISABILITIES ALL OF OUR STUDENTS I THANK THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR OF AB. THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE FOR OPPORTUNITY SHARE INPUT WITH YOU. SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING EQUITY IS NEEDED NOW THE CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL ALSO CALLED AB SIX SO TO WAS ENACTED IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES. THIS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. ONE GLARING ISSUE THE SHOWS A. B. SIX SO TOO HAS NOT KEPT UP IS IN EQUITY IN THE BASE FUNDING BETWEEN THE SELFLESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN MY OWN COUNTY ARE SUPPOSED TO TOUCH OUR BOUNDARIES ARE FUNDED OUT FIVE HUNDRED NINETY THREE DOLLARS FOR ADA Y. MINE IS FUNDED AT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR A DEER. IF OUR SUPPER RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF EDTA FUNDING NEVER WOULD RECEIVE FIVE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS MORE TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS. THIS DISCREPANCY EXISTS FOR NO LOGICAL REASON AND EXIST ACROSS THE STATE. AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX CORRECTS THESE INEQUITIES IN PLACES US ON A PLAYABLE PLAYING FIELD TO SUPPORT ALL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ACROSS THE STATE LIKE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS. ADDITIONALLY AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX ALSO CREATES A FUNDING FORMULA TO OFFSET THE COSTS OFFICIALLY MANDATED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. FOR NOT ONLY THE EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN PRESCHOOL STUDENTS IN MY SUPPER. BUT THE NEARLY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PRESCHOOL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. BASED ON STATEWIDE REPORTED DATA WE'RE ONLY RECEIVING TWENTY CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND ON THE SERVICES FOR OUR YOUNGEST STUDENTS. WE ALL KNOW THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INTENSIVE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL GAINS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AS WE ALWAYS SAY IF YOU DON'T WANT AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP DON'T LET IT START. AND LASTLY REPLETE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IS NEEDED FOR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THE STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES COME TO US NEEDING SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT SUCH AS INTERPRETERS SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS JUST TO NAME A FEW. FOR EXAMPLE IN MY VERY OWN DISTRICT WE RECENTLY PAID OVER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR ONE TEXTBOOK TO BE TRANSCRIBED INTO BRAILLE FOR EACH STUDENT WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS. THAT'S STUDENT DESERVES THAT BOOK. AS PART AS AS A STATE WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION TO REFORM ONE PART OF OUR EDUCATIONAL FISCAL SYSTEM. AS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO MEET THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE BELIEVE THE PISTOL THE CURRENT FISCAL CLIMATE IS RIGHT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. IN CLOSING I URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. BY SUPPORTING AB THIRTY ONE THIRTY SIX AND TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR SPECTACULAR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE STAFF AND FAMILIES THAT SUPPORT THEM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

I'M SURE WELL WHERE THAT'S THAT STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE CONSISTENTLY PROVIDED INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS.

I'M ALSO SPOKE PLEASE THAT WOULD INCLUDING PRESCHOOL HIM THIS BECAUSE THAT IS CRITICAL AND I THINK WAS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I CHEER AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET FOR THE STATE. THAT WE ARE BEGIN TO REFUND EARLY START. WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO KIDS AND. AT THE TIME IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA THAT I WOULD NEED. EARLY START WITH MY OWN GRANDSON AND. AND SAW SO PROUD WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT AS A WOULD MAKE THEIR SERVICES FOR HIM IN THE AREA OF LANGUAGE IT'S AN AND UP HE'S IN. A. NOT GO HE'S IN THE MASONS DISTRICT WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO YOURS. BUT THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT AND IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD WHEN WE COME IN EARLY IN PRESCHOOL BECAUSE WHEN THEY GET READY TO GO TO ELOP KINDERGARTEN THEY ARE PREPARED. AND SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A COUPLE YEARS OF SERVICE BUT IT MAKES A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY GO TO REGULAR SCHOOL OR. KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE BECAUSE IN THEIR ON TASK AND THEY'RE READY WHEN IF WE HAD NOT YOU HAD WE HAD NOT INTERVENED AS STATE. THERE'D BE STRUGGLING THROUGH THE MOST INFORMATIVE YEARS OF KINDERGARTEN FIRST SECOND THIRD GRADE SO THE EARLY START PROGRAMS THAT WE DO. ARE VERY IMPORTANT OUR PRESCHOOL A SPECIAL ED ASSESSMENTS ARE JUST CRITICAL TO THE LIFE OF OUR KIDS AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE. THIS IS AN AMAZING PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PUSH IT I APPRECIATE IT I MOVE THAT WE APPROVE THIS AND IF POSSIBLE WOULD LIKE TO BE A COLOSSAL. MISTER O'DONNELL BUDGET BECAUSE.

YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE. AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE ROUTE WOULD REQUIRE A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL TO PROVIDE EACH LOW INCOME STUDENT WITH ONE NUTRITIOUS FREE OR REDUCED PRICED MEAL. EACH SCHOOL DAY. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED A LOT TO PROTECT CHILDREN ROM HUNGER. BY GUARANTEEING THAT ALTHOUGH INCOME PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE NUTRITIOUS MEAL. EACH SCHOOL DAY. DESPITE ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT PROTECTED. UNDER THIS LAW MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND LOW INCOME STUDENTS ATTEND CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS AND OF THE STUDENTS MORE THAN EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND ATTEND. A CHARTER SCHOOL WITHOUT ACCESS TO FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS OR IN MANY CASES ANY MEALS. AT ALL RESEARCHING COMMONSENSE TELL US THAT CHILDREN MUST BE WELL NOURISHED IN ORDER TO LEARN GROW AND ACHIEVE THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. ACCESS TO MAIL SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ATTEND A TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL. OR A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES CALIFORNIA ST PARENT TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND WESTERN. CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WHILE THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION IS OPPOSE WE KNOW THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS BILL. AND WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AS WE HAVE ALREADY TO. A HOPEFULLY FIND REASONABLE SOLUTIONS AND AREAS OF COMMON GROUND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. WITH ME HERE TODAY IS TRACY PATTERSON REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND CAROL BECAUSE HE FIRED REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARENT. TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. GOOD EVENING. OF. I WAS SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA WE'RE REALLY PROUD TO BE A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. MAKING SURE THAT KIDS HAVE NUTRITIOUS MEALS ARE IT'S REALLY PART OF THE DNA OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA. IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES PTA CREATED SPECIAL NUTRITION PROJECT AND EMERGENCY SERVICES TO PREVENT CHILDREN FROM SUFFERING DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES WE LAUNCHED A NATIONWIDE SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES WE PASSED RESOLUTIONS URGING ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ESTABLISH AND PROMOTE SCHOOL. BREAKFAST AND LUNCH PROGRAMS FOR A BALANCED NUTRITIOUS MEAL. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE WERE ONE OF MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT. ARGUED STRONGLY FOR THE BIPARTISAN HEALTHY HUNGER FREE KIDS ACT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR. MEALS ARE NUTRITIOUS. SO WE CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR NUTRITIOUS MEALS FOR ALL CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART NUTRITIOUS MEALS FOR ALL CHILDREN. UP SO WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO COSPONSOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE I'M TRACY PATTERSON OF CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES WERE PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS OF MAYBE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE. AND WE WANT TO COMMEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA STRONG LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE HIS LIFELONG DEDICATION TO CIVIL RIGHTS AND HIS COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN OF COLOR. TEACHING KIDS IS HARD WORK FEEDING KIDS IN SCHOOL ISHARD WORK AS A FORMER TEACHER IN HIGH NEED SCHOOLS I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND HOW HARD THAT WORK IS. BUT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT FOR CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY SHOWING UP TO SCHOOL HUNGRY AND TRYING TO FOCUS THEY HAVE AN EVEN HARDER JOB THAN WE DO. SO WE'RE FOOD ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WE GENERALLY DON'T WADE INTO THE THORNY POLITICS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. ABUT AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE ISN'T ABOUT POLITICS THIS IS ABOUT A COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA KIDS AND BELIEVING THAT NO STUDENT SHOULD GO HUNGRY AND A PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOL. BY ESTABLISHING THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE STATE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT SCHOOLS NEED MORE RESOURCES TO BETTER SERVE DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND CLOSE THE PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WITH ALL THE FF ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE EXTRA SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR THOSE LOW INCOME CHILDREN ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEALS THAT THEY ENROLL. HOWEVER. CLOSE TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT PROVIDE THAT MOST BASIC SERVICE FOR WHICH THOSE CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION FOR MONTHS WE HOPE TO COME TO US A REASONABLE SOLUTION WITH THEM BUT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME MISCONCEPTIONS PUT FORWARD ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND MEALS. THE CHALLENGES THE FEEDING STUDENTS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THESE ARE CHALLENGES THAT ALL SCHOOLS OF ALL SIZES AND LOCATIONS. OVERCOME. THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM. ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS CAN RECEIVE STATE AND FEDERAL CATEGORICAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOL MEALS TO THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH AND BREAKFAST PROGRAMS THAT FUNDING GIMME USED OPERATE STAFF AND ADMINISTER SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS. ALL CHARTERS CAN RECEIVE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM EQUIPMENT FACILITIES GRANTS AND RURAL CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN RECEIVE WELFARE FACILITY GRANTS AS WELL. ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE NIELSEN STUDENTS IN NEED REGARDLESS OF LOCATION REGARDLESS OF SIZE THEY HAVE MANY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS ONLY ONE. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WHO OUR WITHOUT MEALS RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT ALL FUTURE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN DRUG USE AS WELL.

CLEVER THE ALSO INTO THE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE EXCLUSIVELY VIRTUAL SCHOOLS KNOWS WHAT ORIGINAL LOCATION OR. BONE STRUCTURES HOMEOWNER EXEMPT FROM THESE PROVISIONS AND CLARIFY THE SCHOOL A. IS ONE WHICH PUPILS ARE IN ATTENDANCE FOR ANY PART OF THAT DAY YES THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION WEEKS AT THE MOMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M CALLING MILLER THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. AND. I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. CALIFORNIA SHORT SCHOOLS CESSATION DOES SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. WE WE. TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE. THE INTENT ON THE GOAL TO SERVE. STUDENTS WHO WHO NEED A MALE. THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE. THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ENGAGING US ON THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. SO. UNLESS THE BILL CAN ADDRESS SOME VERY REAL AND SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE FACT IS THAT A VAST MAJORITY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS ALREADY ARE PROVIDING MEALS AYE WE ESTIMATE THAT FEWER THAN FIVE PERCENT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS BY THIS MEASURE. HOWEVER. THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT PROVIDING MALES. OFTEN FACE VERY SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. TO DOING SO WHICH MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE CAN IMPOSE A SIGNIFICANT NEW MANDATE. CHARTERS INTERPERSONAL SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES THAT DISTRICTS DO IN THIS AREA. IT'S NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD PARTICULARLY WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL IS A LEAST FACILITY IT MAY HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO MAKE OF RENOVATIONS TO THAT BUILDING. REGARDLESS OF OF POTENTIAL GRANT FUNDS. THEY MAY NOT HAVE ANY RESOURCES TO DO THAT. EVEN WHEN THE SCHOOLS HAVE FACILITIES AND THE MEANS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. IT CAN TAKE UP TO A YEAR SOMETIMES TO GET THROUGH THE RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY THROUGH LOCAL HEALTH APPROVALS AS WELL AS I GETTING LICENSED THROUGH THE. SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM. PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING WHEN CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE TO MOVE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND GET. RE COMPLIANT WITH THEIR WITH THE FACILITY THAT THEY'RE MOVING INTO. SO I WE ALSO HAVE CONCERT WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. AROUND THE DEFINITION OF. EXEMPTIONS FOR NON CLASSROOM BASED ON. STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS ON THE CODE ALREADY HAS A CLEAR DEFINITION OF NON CLASSROOM BASED SCHOOLS AND. THERE WERE. WITH OUT. WITHOUT SOME CLEAR THE SO WE WOULD WE WOULDN'T REALLY NEED TO HAVE SOME CLARITY AROUND AROUND THAT ISSUE. IF THAT INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO PROVIDE MEALS TOLD WILL STUDENTS I WE DO NEED TO GET AMENDMENTS TO INCLUDE SOLUTIONS TO INSIST CHARTER SCHOOLS. IN OUR REALISTICALLY MEETING THAT GOAL AND WE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ANNOUNCEMENT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CASEY TAYLOR AND FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ACHIEVE CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE'VE BEEN OPERATING SMALL KATE CHARTER SCHOOL IN RURAL PARADISE LOCATED IN BUTTE COUNTY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE WILL OPEN A HIGHSCHOOL STARTING WITH JUST NINTH GRADE THIS FALL. COMMITTED DEFEATING ALL STUDENTS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN SOME OF OUR SITUATIONS ARE STUDENTS. THE MEAL THAT WE PROVIDE THEM AS THE ONLY HEALTHY MEAL THAT THEY RECEIVE. IN A DAY AND WERE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE SPIRIT OF THE SPELL. HOWEVER CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS TO MEET THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM GUIDELINES ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS SO IT TOOK MY SCHOOL THREE YEARS TO GAIN ACCESS TO SPACE TO CREATE A WARMING KITCHEN. TO AFFORD TO UPGRADE THAT SPACE TO MEET NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH GUIDELINES UP TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND. FACILITY UPGRADES TO ELECTRICAL AND PLUMBING THAT THE GRANTS DIDN'T COVER AND THEN ALSO TO HIRE AND TRAIN STAFF TO COMPLY WITH REPORTING IN SERVING GUIDELINES. A SMALL SCHOOL BY DESIGN WE OPEN WITH NINE STAFF IN A HUNDRED STUDENTS WITH LIMITED SPACE STUDENTS EIGHT LUNCHEON OUR CLASSROOMS AND WE SERVED MEALS OUT OF THE STAFF ROOM. WITH INADEQUATE FACILITIES AND NOT ENOUGH STAFF TO MEET THE TRACKING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WE COULD NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS SO HE SERVED MEALS AND SUBSIDIZE OUR STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE AND READ OUT REDUCED LUNCH MEALS OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND BUDGET. WAS THAT IMPORTANT TO US BY YEAR THREE THAT WE HAD THE RESOURCES TO LEASE SPACE AND HIRE STAFF TO MEET GUIDELINES AND WE STARTED RECEIVING REIMBURSEMENTS. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT REIMBURSEMENTS DON'T COVER THE COSTS OF THIS PROGRAM LIKE I SAID IT COST MY SCHOOL TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN START UP COSTS. AND IT CURRENTLY COSTS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN OPERATING COSTS INCLUDING OVERHEAD FEES FOR A MEAL CONTRACT. ADDITIONAL LEASE COSTS IN THE COST FOR A FULL TIME STAFF TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM. FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS WE'VE CONTRACTED WITH OUR AUTHORIZING DISTRICT FOR MEALS LAST MONTH WE WERE TOLD BY THEM THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE CONTRACTING WITH US ANY LONGER. AS THE DISTRICT DECIDES WHO THEY CHOOSE TO CONTRACT WITH WE'RE NOT LEFT HIGH AND DRY SCRAMBLING TO FIND A MEAL PROVIDER. THE NEAREST DISTRICT JUST TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM OUR SCHOOL AND IF THEY'RE WILLING TO CONTRACT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION COSTS. IN WORLD REVIEW COUNTY WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO OUTSIDE MIL VENDORS FOUND IN URBAN AREAS AND PROVIDING OUR OWN MEALS WOULD WE CRY OUT WE CHOIR AS TO BUILD A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN. AND HIRE A NUTRITIONAL LIST COSTING THOUSANDS AND REQUIRING MORE TIME A FEW BEEN THREE MONTHS WE HAVE BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. AIRED PREREQUISITE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER REPRESENTING SEVERAL HUNDRED SCHOOLS WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I'M I I JUST HAVE MAYBE A COMMONER QUESTION. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN CHOOSE WHEN YOU WANT O BE EQUAL. WHAT I HEAR IS YOU KNOW? CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE TO BE TREATED AS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO THEY WILL BE TREATED AS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WE SHOULD HAVE THE SAME EXPECTATIONS. AS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT'S HOW I KIND OF SEE THIS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SO THERE'S SOME NUANCES WITH THE VIRTUAL WHICH WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYWAYS. BUT. YEAH I I I I I STRUGGLE SOMETHING THEY SHOULDN'T BE PROVIDING THESE MEALS BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S THE PUBLIC PROVIDERS THE LOCAL DISTRICT IS ALSO PROBABLY THE POTENTIAL FIND A PRIVATE. PROVIDER. FOR MEALS FOR STUDENTS. ON A MAYBE CAN OPINE ON THIS AYE THERE IS A SCHOOL A CHARTER SCHOOL IN LONG BEACH. THAT ACTUALLY HAS A STUDENTS LEAVE DURING LUNCH. IT'S A STOREFRONT. FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM AND THEY ACTUALLY THIS YOU GOTTA YOU GOTTA LEAVE THE SCHOOL GOTTA GO OUT IN THE SCHOOL STUDENTS GO FIND THEIR WAY INTO DOWN THE STREET I WOULD I DON'T. NOT REAL SAFE MISS IN THIS AREA OR REALLY AND I DON'T WANT HIGH SCHOOL KIDS WALKING AROUND THE STREETS DOING NOTHING ANYWAYS. AROUND NOON. DID YOU KNOW IT IT IS THAT THE POLICY IS THAT WITHIN THE BOUNDS A LOT YOU KNOW YOU STILL PLAN ON AND. I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT SCHOOLS LIKE REALLY CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT EXHIBIT WHERE THAT SITUATION. THAT DYNAMIC WHERE SCHOOL HAS A CHARTER SCHOOL HAS A STUDENTS LEAVE IT MUCH I I DON'T KNOW I KNOW MANY HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE OPENED. RAN OPEN. YOU KNOW OPEN TO FORCE THEM ORDERS THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO LEAVE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS HERE I CAN SPEAK TO IT. JUST QUESTION WHETHER WHAT WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED MORE ABOUT THE THE THE MORE. THEM MORE SPECIFIC. YOU KNOW ISSUES OF SCALE SIZE LOCATION AND RURAL LOCATIONS. AYE WE'VE HAD SCHOOLS THAT THAT HAVE BASICALLY HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MALES AND AND TRANSPORTATION. YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN SUCH A SMALL RURAL AREAS AYE BUT SO SO. THERE ARE THERE ARE TRADE OFFS FOR EVERYTHING IN MY AND. YOU KNOW. AS IMPORTANT AS THIS GOAL IS. THE IT DOES COME WITH TRADE OFFS AND LIKELY GET SEASON IN DOLLARS AND START OF GRANTS ALONE. AND THEN THERE'S FACILITY MONEY THAT FLOWS EVERY YEAR TOO SO LET'S JUST REMIND PEOPLE IN THE ROOM OF THAT. ARE WITHOUT OTHERS TOWARDS ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WISH TO. THE CHAIR OF THE AUTHOR QUESTION YEAH. IT I APPLAUD THE THE THIS YEAR INFORMATION OUT. I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DIDN'T PROVIDE LUNCHEON IN LOW INCOME AREAS I THINK MOST OF THEM PROBABLY DO I'M NOT SURE. BUT THE RULE AREAS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF PLACES BUT I DO KNOW THAT. I THINK MOST OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO PROVIDE OF LUNCH FOR THE CHILDREN BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CENTRAL KITCHENS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON. YOU KNOW I WAS GO BACK TO THE AUTHORIZES STORY AS TO WHO AUTHORIZED THE CHARTER AND WITH THE NOT IN AUTHORIZING THE CHART OF THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS TAKING CARE FEEDING KIDS IS FUNDAMENTAL YOU KNOWESPECIALLY IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT I THINK MANY OF OUR CHARTIST RESPONDED THAT. BUT IT SEEMS THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME RESPONSIBILITY ON THE PART OF THE AUTHORIZING AGENCY TO AT LEAST SHARE IF IT'S IF THEY HAVE CENTRAL KITCHENS OR WHATEVER TO. TO ALLOW FOLKS TO I HAVE THE BILL'S BODY AND I KNOW WE DO THAT WITH. WITH MANY OF OUR. ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN STRIP MALLS FOR KIDS WHO ARE. WHO BEEN A PLACED IN THESE FACILITIES LIKE ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS IN THE AND THERE THE SMALLER AND I'VE BEEN IN THOSE PLACES WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DRIVE ALL THOSE PLACES AND BRINGS LUNCH? EVERYDAY TO THOSE STUDENTS SO THIS SHOULD BE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. ON THE PART OF IT AND I I NEVER LIKED THE FIGHT THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN BETWEEN THE CHARTER AND WHATEVER WE CONSIDER THE OTHERS BECAUSE. YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN THE AFRICAN PROVERB TELLS ME WHEN TWO ELEPHANTS FIGHT IS THE GRASS THAT SUFFERS. AND IN THIS CASE THE GRASS IS THE KIDS YOU KNOW WE SHOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN THIS BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT FOOD THAT IS SO FUNDAMENTAL. AND. AND MANY OF OUR OF FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH THINGS COME TO PARK AND REC AND EVERYWHERE ELSE TO PROVIDE ELECTION SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT. BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT IMPORTANT AND I THINK IF YOU'RE TEACHING KIDS WILL POUR IN THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY MEAL THEY HAVE. ARE IT IT HAS TO HAPPEN SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT MAKE IT HAPPEN HOPEFULLY. IN THIS BILL YOU GOTTA FIGURE IT OUT BUT I DON'T THINK ANY CHILD SHOULD. NOT HAVE A THEY'VE MEAL. PARTICULARLY KIDS WILL POOR BECAUSE OFTENTIMES THIS IS THEIR MEAL. AND I'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KIDS ARE HUNGRY A BIT IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE KIDS DON'T GET FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH. AND THEY SPEND ALL DAY THINKING ABOUT FOOD AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO PICK ABOUT LEARNING WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT FOOD. AND SO WOULD AND WE WE'VE GOTTEN PAST THAT AT LEAST I THOUGHT IN THIS COUNTRY. ALSO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE OF US WHO ADULTS. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THOSE NEEDS OF EVERY CHILD IS MET. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE IN WHAT WE CONSIDER THE TRADITIONAL CHARTER A PUBLIC SCHOOL OF THE CHARTER PUBLIC SCHOOL I KIDS DESERVE TO HAVE THE MEAL. MISTER KILEY YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON OR MAYBE IT'S GOOD EVENING WEST POINT. MISTER BONTA. SO THAT INTENTION HERE IS NIGHTLY. GOOD AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT'S REALLY A. VERY RARE. CIRCUMSTANCE. WHERE THIS WOULD EVEN BE RELEVANT TO A SCHOOL ON WHERE IT IS RELEVANT THERE SEEMS A REAL PRACTICAL? DIFFICULTIES THERE BUT. YOU KNOW I.I GUESS I GO BACK TO WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A VERY SIMILAR BILL O. LOOKS LIKE SIX YEARS AGO. YOU KNOW THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT THE THE POINT OF. CHARTERING IS TO HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT REGULATED AS PRESCRIPTIVE ONLY AS. AS OTHER PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE SAID. CUBAN ATTRITION IS PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT BUT SO ALSO IS THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS THEY BE FREE FROM LARGE PORTIONS OF THE LUMINOUS STATE EDUCATION CODE I'M RELUCTANT TO READ THE INDEPENDENCE AND FLEXIBILITY. THAT OF WELL SERVE THE FAMILIES AND TEACHERS WHO CHOOSE THEIR CHARTER SCHOOLS SO I DO DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S SENTIMENT. I I DO. I THINK THAT THEY ARE. SOME THINGS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL. AND SHOULD. BE. SHOULD EXIST IN BOTH CHARTER SCHOOL PUBLIC ARTICLES AND AND TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND. WE'VE AT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE I'VE HAD THAT. A POSITION ON A BILL THAT I'VE BROUGHT FORWARD AND. NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WE SOUGHT TO CHANGE THE GOVERNOR'S MINE. THAT WE CHANGE THE GOVERNOR'S MY LAST YEAR ON A VERY SIMILAR BILL. THAT HE VETOED IN THE PAST AB THIRTEEN SIXTY. WHERE WE SOUGHT TO HAVE OF SOME FOUNDATIONAL FUNDAMENTAL? EQUITY AND FAIRNESS POLICIES AROUND ADMISSIONS AND DISCIPLINE. AND I WE WORK THE TART SCHOOL SO SHE ACTION VERY CLOSELY WE FOUND COMMON GROUND THEY ENDED UP SUPPORTING THE BILL. WILL DO THE SAME THING HERE WERE NOT THERE TODAY WHEN THE FIRST HOUSE THE FIRST COMMITTEE. I BUT I THINK SOME THINGS ARE SO FOUNDATIONAL THAT YOU CAN'T PUT THEM AND FUNDAMENTAL YOU CAN'T PUT THEM IN THE POCKET OF. YOU KNOW I ECONOMY INNOVATION. KIDS NEED TO HAVE. OF MEAL WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE POOR DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ONE THE CAN'T FIGHT THE CAN'T LEARN WHEN THE FIGHTING HUNGER. AND SO I PUT THAT IN IN IN. IN IN AND IN THAT CATEGORY OF OF FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATIONAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS HAVE TO LEARN WHETHER IN A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL OR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL. THE CAR. THINKING SURE WE'RE TALKING FEEDING CHILDREN OF THE BILL. OTHER BILLS REMOVED AND SECOND MINISTER THURMAN. YOU MAY CLOSE THE MOTION IS. DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THAT IS THE MOTION. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TELL YOU HAVE DISCUSSED THIS BILL IN AND THE NEED TO FEED OUR KIDS IN SCHOOLS WHETHER THEY BE PUBLIC CHARTER TRADITIONAL PUBLIC. WE. I APPRECIATE THAT STAFF AND THIS COMMITTEE'S INPUT WE WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH AT THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND WE THINK THAT. WE APPRECIATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH IMPLEMENTATION WE WANT WE WANT HELP OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO DO SO. I RESPECT THE ASK AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AGAIN THE EMOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL O'DONNELL AYE O'DONNELL AYE KILEY. KILEY KNOWS KALRA. OVER I'M MCCARTY STEINORTH.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS BY STRENGTHENING THE CALIFORNIA NETWORK OF FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN OH FOR HELPS PARENTS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES GAIN ACCESS TO CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO LITIGATION. GETTING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES CAN BE A LONG AND COMPLEX PROCESS THAT REQUIRES PARENTS. TO CONNECT WITH MANY DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. AS THEY WORK THROUGH ALL OF THIS PARENTS ARE TOLD THEY HAVE TO GET SERVICES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE EARLY INTERVENTION IS CRITICAL FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S LONG TERM SUCCESS. WELL SUPPORT THIS JOURNEY CAN BE OVERWHELMING. AMONG THE MANY SERVICES THEY PROVIDE FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS HELP PARENTS UNDERSTAND THEIR CHILDREN'S DISABILITIES. CONNECT THEM WITH PROVIDERS AND SERVICES AND WALK THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS OF GETTING INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAMS THE EYEPIECE COMPLETED. FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS ALSO HELP RESOLVE DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN PARENTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEFORE DISPUTES ESCALATE TO THE POINT OF A JUDGE REQUIRED. DENIED A JUDGE BEING REQUIRED TO INTERVENE. IT HELPS STOP LITIGATION. WHEN FAMILY APPARENT CENTERS WERE CREATED THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED FOR THERE TO BE THIRTY TO CENTERS BUT OVER THE PAST SIXTEEN YEARS ONLY FOURTEEN HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. THIS MEANS THAT MANY FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA LACK ACCESS TO FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN OF FOUR WILL HELP US BRING IMPORTANT SERVICES THAT FAMILY EMPOWERMENT CENTERS PROVIDE A MORE FAMILIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE MAUREEN O'LEARY BIT. BURN ES FORMER CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE WIDE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE.

TO HELP PARENTS GAIN THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM IN AND FORMED AN INSTRUCTIVE WAY. THEREBY SUPPORTING THEIR CHILD AND ASSISTING EDUCATORS AND KNOWING THEIR CHILD AND THE CHILD'S NEEDS. PARENT ENGAGEMENT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND THE FEC SUPPORT EFFECTIVE PARENT ENGAGEMENT.

OUR TASK FORCE MEMBERS INCLUDED MANY PARENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS CONCERNED ABOUT IMPROVED SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND RESULTS FROM ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WE MIGHT MAKE. WE HAD RECOGNIZE THAT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROCESS HAS BECOME AS REFERENCED IN TOO MANY CASES. LITIGIOUS RATHER THAN COLLABORATIVE AND WE FELT THAT THE WORK OF THE FCC'S WOULD BENEFIT EVERYONE ON THE PROCESS NOT JUST FAMILIES. BUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THE SCHOOL SITES ANSEL POSE WITH WHICH FAMILIES WORK. THIS IS WHAT IS DONE ARE FEW CURRENT FTC'S NOW BY FOSTERING COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FAMILIES AND STAFF.

ENGLISH LEARNERS SOME BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE CORE CURRICULUM COURSES OF OUR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. RESEARCH OVER MANY DECADES SHOWS THAT ENGLISH LEARNERS EXPERIENCE LIMITS ON THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN. ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE LESS LIKELY THAN NON ENGLISH LEARNERS TO BE ENROLLED IN CORE COURSES IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS MATHEMATICS SOCIAL STUDIES AND SCIENCE. EVEN ONE CONTROLLING FOR PRIOR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IN SOME CASES ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE PLACED IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT COURSES INSTEAD OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS COURSES. IN OTHER CASES ENGLISH LANGUAGE ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE PLACED IN REMEDIAL COURSES. DO NOT PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE FULL CURRICULUM. SOME STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY TRAPPED. TOLL THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS COURSES UNTIL THEY'RE RECLASSIFIED BUT ABLE TO RECLASSIFY DUE TO A LACK OF PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS. THIS IS NOT A RARE OCCURRENCE IN CALIFORNIA FOR SURE IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE COMPLIANCE FINING IN THE CD'S MONITORING OF DISTRICTS REGARDING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS ENGLISH LEARNERS IS ACCESS TO THE CORE. CURRICULUM. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS THE DENIAL OF ENGLISH LEARNERS EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN THE CORE CURRICULUM OF SCHOOLS. BUT IT ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO WITHHOLD CORE CURRICULUM COURSES IF THEY CHOOSE TO FOCUS FIRST. ON ENGLISH ACQUISITION. ANY TEACHER WILL TELL YOU THAT BY THE TIME THE STUDENTS ARE FINALLY ALLOWED TO TAKE CORE COURSES THEY'RE SIMPLY TOO FAR BEHIND TO CATCH UP THEY WILL GRADUATE. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY FIVE MESA CLEAR THAT ENGLISH LEARNER SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE CORE CURRICULUM. IN OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS. THIS BILL ISN'T IS A NECESSARY STEP FOR ENSURING THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN AND SUCCEED. CALIFORNIA EDUCATES ONE OF THREE ENGLISH LEARNERS IN THE UNITED STATES ONE IN THREE IS IN THIS STATE. EACH ONE DESERVES AN EDUCATION WORTHY OF THEIR ATTENTION. I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I'VE. WITH ME TODAY I OF MARTHA SIR GO CITY AS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIANS TOGETHER. IN THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF% BILINGUAL EDUCATORS AND I HAVE AS WELL GARCIA LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARTHA SARAH GOES THE DS AND I'M REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR BILINGUAL EDUCATION AND CALIFORNIANS GATHER AND WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY FIVE IS A STRAIGHT FORWARD BILL. IT PROPOSES TO SOLVE A PROBLEM FACED BY MANY ENGLISH LEARNERS THAT OF UNEQUAL ACCESS TO THE CORE. ACADEMIC SUBJECTS SUCH AS SCIENCE AND HISTORIES OF SOCIAL. HISTORY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE. DUE TO THEIR EMAIL STATUS FROM MARK OUR MEMBERSHIP WE KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING. DUE TO THEIR STATUS THE SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME INSTRUCTIONAL TIME IN EITHER IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY LA OR IN MATH. OFTENTIMES THEY'RE PLACED IN INTERVENTION CLASSES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THEIR LANGUAGE OR ACADEMIC NEEDS. AS A RESULT A SIZEABLE GAP IN INSTRUCTION OCCURS. LEADING TO ENGLISH LEARNERS BURNING A FEW CREDITS FOR GRADUATION AND BEING PREVENTED FROM BEING RECLASSIFIED. MUCH RESEARCH EXISTS CONFIRMING THIS PATTERN OF EXCLUSION FROM MORE ACADEMIC CLASSES AS RISK AS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS ON PAGE SIX. IN ONE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDY IN A LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICT FORTY SIX PERCENT OF ENGLISH LEARNERS WORD NOT ENROLLED IN AT LEAST ONE CORE CURRICULUM. AREA COMPARED TO FIVE PERCENT OF NON ENGLISH LEARNERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY FIVE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY PROHIBITING AN ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENT FROM BEING DENIED ENROLLMENT. IN A CORE CURRICULUM COURSE. AND COURSES REQUIRED FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION EXCEPT FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN NEWCOMER PROGRAMS. LET'S ENSURE OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN IN OUR SCHOOLS PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY FIVE THANK YOU. ISABEL GARCIA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WERE URGING YOUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS SPELL AS SO ELOQUENTLY THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN LAID OUT WITH. THERE ARE CHAIRMAN AND THE SPONSORS AND CT BELIEVES THAT ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ALL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING A RIGOROUS AND RELEVANT COLLEGE AND CAREER. UP CURRICULUM THAT PREPARES THEM FOR SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE AND ALL ENGLISH LEARNERS SHOULD TO SIR TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME QUIRK. COURSES THAT EVERY OTHER STUDENTS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAS ON I AS AN ENGLISH LAWYER. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE THE JOY OF LEARNING AND TO BE MOTIVATED TO AND FEEL THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING LEFT BEHIND. ENGLISH LEARNERS SHOULD NOT BE RELEGATED TO REMEDIAL COURSES INTO NIGHT ACCESS TO THE CORE CURRICULUM. FOR JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE LINGUISTICALLY DIFFERENT. ON THE SO UP WITH ALL THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN EVERYTHING. WE FEEL THIS BILL IS ESSENTIAL TO GUARANTEEING THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE CORPORATE COMMAND THE ADVANCED COURSES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED SO WE URGE YOUR STRONG SUPPORT.

REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL TO HELP TEACHERS EVALUATE STUDENTS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. FOR USE AND RE CLASSIFICATION DECISIONS. CURRENT LAW ESTABLISHES FOUR CRITERIA FOR THE CAN BECAUSE OF CREATION OF ENGLISH LEARNERS AS FULLY FOR OPPRESSION. ONE OF THESE CRITERIA THE TEACHERS EVALUATION ENGLISH LEARNERS PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH. WELL THIS EVALUATION HIGHLY CONSEQUENTIAL FOR STUDENTS THE STATE HAS PROVIDED NO TOOLS LEADER NOT NO TOOLS OR GUIDANCE TO TEACHERS ON HOW TO MAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS. AS A RESULT THESE EVALUATIONS VARY WIDELY FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND EVEN FROM CLASSROOM TO CLASSROOM. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT FACTORS UNRELATED TO ENGLISH PROFICIENCY SUCH AS BEHAVIOR ATTENDANCE AND HOMEWORK COMPLETION ARE FREQUENTLY INCLUDED AND HOLD BACK STUDENTS FROM ACROSS A FINE. IS NOT GOOD. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THESE FACTORS AS A THESE FACTORS A KEY REASON WHY SOME ENGLISH LEARNERS WHO TEST PROFICIENT ON BOTH ENGLISH. LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT RECLASSIFIED. WE NEED A BETTER STANDARD. THE FEDERAL EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT SO REQUIRES THAT STATES ADOPT STANDARDIZE RE CLASSIFICATION PROCEDURES THAT ARE REVISED A SUPPLANT COMMITS TO DEVELOPING THIS PROTOCOL. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY THREE WILL MEET TEACHERS NEED FOR A STANDARDIZED FOR STANDARDIZED STANDARDS ALIGNED PROTOCOL FOR MEASURING THEIR STUDENT'S PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH. EVENTUALLY MAKING RE CLASSIFICATION MORE CONSISTENT AND FAIR PROCESS FOR ALL WITH ME IN SUPPORT I HAVE SHE LOANING CREWS GONZALEZ BOARD PRED WARD VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ZOO SO UNIFIED.

GOOD EVENING CHAIR MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS MONEY MACHINE RUNNING CHRIS GONZALEZ. AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ITS TOGETHER BUT I'M ALSO SPEAKING AS A SIXTEEN YEAR SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY THREE. FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS REQUEST WE CLASSIFICATION IS A CRITICAL MILESTONE REPRESENTING THE CULMINATION OF YEARS OF WORK IN DEVELOPING LINGERS THE ENGLISH SKILLS NECESSARY TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL LIKE OTHER CHILDREN. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT AN ABSENCE OF STATE GUIDANCE THE INPUT THAT TEACHERS PROVIDE IN THE REQUEST OF THE HAITIAN PROCESS IS INCONSISTENT. AND OFTEN INVOLVES FACTORS IRRELEVANT TO THEIR ENGLISH AN ACADEMIC PROFICIENCY. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE TOOK A VERY HARD LOOK AT OUR WE CLASSIFICATION PROCESS. AND FOUND THAT SOME SCHOOLS WERE USING FACTORS THAT WERE JUST SYSTEM EXPLAINED BY BY ASSEMBLYMAN O'DONNELL. AFFECTED LIKE ATTNDANCE BEHAVIOR AND HOMER COMPLETION WERE SOMETIMES OVERRIDING THE STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE ON STANDARDIZED TESTS. IN OTHER SCHOOLS WE FOUND THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THEY MAY HAVE HAD MUCH HIGHER CLASSIFICATION RATES. BUT THOSE STUDENTS RISK WERE STRUGGLING MORE ONCE THEY RECLASSIFIED. EVEN THOUGH WE HAD ADOPTED BOARD POLICY MISUNDERSTANDING R. HIGHLY CONSEQUENTIAL AFFECTS ON THE STUDENTS. WE THEN REVAMPS OUR PROCESS SO THAT WITH GREATER CONSISTENCY AND HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES I HAVE LAID OUT. AB TWENTY SEVEN SIXTY THREE DIRECTS DEVELOPMENT OF VALIDATED HIGH QUALITY CONCERT CONSTRUCT RELEVANT LANGUAGE USE OBSERVATION PROTOCOL FOR TEACHERS USED. IT WILL ALSO MOVE THE STATE TOWARD THE MORE CONSISTENT. AND FAIR CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM ENEMY EVEN SERVE TO YOU TO BE USED AS A USEFUL FORMATIVE MEASURE SO THAT TEACHERS CAN MORE ACCURATELY TRACK THEIR STUDENTS PROGRESS IN ENGLISH. THE STATE'S NEW ENGLISH LEARNER ROAD SETS OUT THE STATE SAYS THAT THE STATE'S VISION FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS. THAT THEY I QUOTE MEANINGFUL ACCESS AND PARTICIPATE IN A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY EDUCATION. THAT RESULTS IN THE RETAINING HIGH LEVELS OF ENGLISH PROFICIENCY MASTERY OF GRADE LEVEL STANDARDS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP PROFICIENCY IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. TO REALIZE HIS VISION THE STATE NEEDS EVERY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT IS CONSISTENT FAIR AND SAID STUDENTS ON A PATH TO SUCCESS. I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL ON A HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GOOD EVENING SUE BANG ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TAREQ SEND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AS A TOMORROW DON'T MENTION FEDERAL LAW UNDER EVER SINCE THE SEATS ACT REQUIRES STATES TO IMPLEMENT A STANDARD I STATEWIDE.

AND. FINALLY WEHAVE EVEN THE THIRTY ONE THE SIXTY SEVEN ITEM THIRTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS THIS BILL CONTINUES THE WORK OF THE CHARTER AUTHORIZED OR REGIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK KNOWN AS CARS NET. BY PROVIDING UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING OVER FIVE YEARS. THIS FUNDING WILL ALLOW CARS NET TO CONTINUE THE MODEL THEY STARTED WITH TRAINEES OF CONFERENCES FOR CHARTER AUTHORIZES AUTHORIZES TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICE. CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZES HAVE VERY FEW RESOURCES FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT HERE FOR THEIR THE CHARTER AUTHORIZING NETWORK AND OVERSIGHT. WORK. FEW CHARTER AUTHORIZES HAVE STAFF THAT IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZING AND OVERSIGHT. AND MOST OF AUTHORIZED HERS AND MOST AUTHORIZES ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY DEDICATED. CHARTER SCHOOL STAFF. THESE AUTHORIZES HAVE RELIED ON THE ASSISTANCE OF CARS NET FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS FUNDED BY A FEDERAL GRAND. THE FEDERAL GRANT FUNDING EXPIRES THIS YEAR AND WITHOUT STATE RESOURCES THE CAR'S NOT EXPERT CARS NOT EXPERTISE WILL BE LOST IN AUTHORIZES WILL NOT HAVE A RESOURCE FOR BEST PRACTICES. AND TOOLS FOR AUTHORIZING OVERSIGHT. OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE BILL DIRECTS CARS NET TO FOCUS ON RECRUITING AND PROVIDING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO DISTRICTS THAT HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED IN TRAININGS AND CONFERENCES IN THE PAST. THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES AN EVALUATION SO WE CAN MEASURE CARS NOT SUCCESS IN THE FUTURE AND I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND I HAVE SOME WITNESSES HERE TODAY. AND GET AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM INTERESTED POLICY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. RESPONSIBLE ALONGSIDE MY TEAM FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CARS NET FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. I WISH TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FOR HIS AUTHORING THIRTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. THE WORK OF CARS NET. IT HAS ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WITH THE SUPPORT AND TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO BE WELL INFORMED ABOUT SOUND AUTHORIZING PRACTICES AND TO OVERSEE THE ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE AND FISCAL OPERATIONS. OF CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE'VE SUPPORT HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SUPERINTENDENTS ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENTS AND CHARTER AUTHORIZING STAFF WITH THE RESEARCH BASED BEST PRACTICES THROUGH VARIOUS COMPONENTS. INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE TRAININGS FOR NEW AND EXPERIENCED AUTHORIZED HERS. AND ALSO VETERANS WHO ARE READY TO TAKE MORE ADVANCED TASKS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OUR CARS NOT BOOT CAMP IN MASTER CLASSES. FOR USE OF EPICENTER WHICH IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED WEB BASED CHARTER OVERSIGHT TOOL ADAPTED TO CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS. A WEBSITE WITH DOWNLOADABLE OVERSIGHT RESOURCES. AND AN ANNUAL CONFERENCE FOR DISTRICT A COUNTY OFFICE CHARTER AUTHORIZING STAFF AND BOARD MEMBERS. FINALLY ARE REGIONAL SUPPORT NETWORKS TO ADDRESS HOT TOPIC ISSUES OF CONCERN THROUGH MEETINGS TRAININGS AND TELECONFERENCES. CARSON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REGIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK LED BY EXPERIENCED AUTHORIZE OURS HAS BEEN A GREAT STRENGTH OF OUR PROGRAM. WITHOUT RIEF BACKGROUND I WILL NOT HUNDRED OVER TO SUPERINTENDENT MONROE. AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO PASS A B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. TO CONTINUE THE IMPROVEMENT OF CHARTER AUTHORIZING IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS TIME KAREN MONROE ARMY ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. AND I TOO WISH TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FIRST LEADERSHIP AND OFFERING. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. FUTURE FUNDING OF CARS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SUBSTANTIALLY BUILT UPON THE WORK THAT'S BEEN STARTED TO THROUGH THE PILOT. BECAUSE THIS GRANT WILL ENSURE HIGH QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZING IN THE STATE IT WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER OF REGIONAL NETWORK LEADS FROM SIX TO ELEVEN. BUT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND IT WILL FURTHER THE REGIONAL NETWORK LEADS. AND DEVELOP FISCAL QUALITY ACADEMIC. I AM GOVERNMENT'S AUTHORIZING OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING TOOLS. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ALLEYWAYS TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN ARE SERVED BY TURNED THE CHILDREN WHO ARE SERVED BY CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE. HEIGHTENED THE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION THEY DESERVE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF ELEAZAR ONLY OVERSEE ONE OR TWO CHARTERS AND. REALLY NEED SUPPORT IN NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE PETITION REVIEW PROCESS AND CHARTER OVERSIGHT. EASY WAYS CORE BELIEFS AND STARTING CARS NOW DOWN WISHING TO CONTINUE THIS WORK ARE THREEFOLD. OUR FIRST CORE BELIEF IS THAT EFFECTIVE AUTHORIZES SHOULD A ONLY APPROVED APPLICATIONS FOR NEW CHARTERS THAT ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED. B. IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS PROBLEMS AND OPERATIONS AND FINANCE THROUGH CONSISTENT MONITORING. SEE HOLD SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES THROUGH A RIGOROUS RENEWAL PROCESS. OUR SECOND CORE BELIEF IS THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF AUTHORIZING PRACTICE IMPROVES THE ABILITY OF AUTHORIZES TO EFFECTIVELY ENSURE THAT STUDENTS SERVED BY THE SCHOOLS ARE RECEIVING A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. OUR THIRD CORE BELIEF IS THAT A RIGOROUS AND WELL MANAGED PETITION PROCESS AND CONSISTENT OVERSIGHT PRACTICES. ARE KEY NOT ONLY FOR ENSURING POSITIVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. BUT FOR FISCALLY SOUND FOR FISCAL SOUND GOVERNANCE AND OPERATIONS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY TO CALIFORNIA'S TAXPAYERS AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PASS A B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN TO CONTINUE THE IMPROVEMENT OF CHARTER AUTHORIZING IN CALIFORNIA THINK YOU. DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CASBAH IN SUPPORT. THE INJURY TO BE HALF OF THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I WILL BRING IT BACK AT THE COMMITTEE I AM. MR O'DONNELL I I I CERTAINLY. AGREE THE CARS THAT HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD AND IMPORTANT WORK. AND. AND MORE ATTENTION TO IMPROVING THAT THE QUALITY AND AND. EXPERTISE BEHIND CHARTER AUTHORIZING IS IS WELCOME I DO HAVE A FEW OUT QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH AND I GUESS MY CONCERN WOULD BE THAT IT'S A PRETTY RAPID SCALE UP IN A WAY THAT MAYBE IS NOT IS FIRMLY ANCHORED TO. WHITE CARS AND HAS DONE SO FAR SO YOU COULD HELP ADDRESS A FEW THOSE CONCERNS THAT MIGHT BE. HELPFUL. DO YOU OUT HOW HOW EXACTLY ARE WE GOING TO BE MEASURING. THE THE WORK THAT TIME THAT IS GOING TO BE STARTED UMBER THE EXPANSION. UNDER THE UNDER THIS BILL I'M LIKE SPECIFICALLY WHAT I KIND OF THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE SEEKING. THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA START SEEING FROM CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZES WHO WERE ASSISTED IN HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEASURE THOSE OUT. VERY WELL THANK YOU JUST JUMBOTRON OF THE SECRETARY JUST TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROGRAM IS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE IS UP AND RUNNING HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME SO THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. NOW THEY WISH TO EXPAND ON THAT. AND I WAS JUST GOING TO BUILD ON THAT VERY POINT SO WE FOR YEARS THIS IS ACTUALLY. WOULD BE THE NEXT STEP IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE GRANT THAT WE HAVE RUN FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS SO. HAVE HAD A TRACK RECORD OF ASSISTING. DISTRICTS OR AUTHORIZES WITH SIX OR FEWER WE ACTUALLY OF. PROVIDED TECHNICALS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ELEAZAR WHO HAVE OF. A LARGER PORTFOLIO AS WELL BUT THE GRANT THE FEDERAL GRANTS THAT INITIATED THIS PROGRAM WAS FOCUS ON. SMALLER AUTHORIZES WHO TEND TO BE THE ONES WHO NEED THE SUPPORTS THEY DON'T HAVE DESIGNATED STAFF. OUGHT TO FOCUS ON OF LEARNING AND IMPLEMENTING THESE PROCESSES AT A HIGH QUALITY. AYE IN A HIGH QUALITY WAY. I'M GONNA LET MISS CAPELLAS TALK ABOUT OUR MEASUREMENT TOOLS SOME OF THE DATA THAT THEY'RE GATHERING STATEWIDE ABOUT HOW CHARTER AUTHORIZES ARE USING THE TOOLS THE CARDS THAT PROVIDES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS IS TO UTILIZE AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR TO LOOK AT EACH ONE OF OUR TRAININGS. AND CONFERENCES TO MEASURE THE LEARNING BOTH BUT FOR THE TRAINING OCCURRED AND AFTER SO THAT WE CAN. ACTUALLY SEE THE LEVEL OF GROWTH IN. THE AUTHOR RISERS EXPERTISE. THAT IS JUST ONE WAY THAT WE WILL BE MEASURING THIS GOING FORWARD AS WELL. AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION. OTHERS ABOUT THOSE WHO AUTHORIZED AND WHAT CAN THEY DO WHAT CAN'T THEY DO WHAT SHOULD THEY DO WHAT SHOULD THEY DO. BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SEE THE DISTINCTION SO THAT AUTHORIZING. PROCESS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE AUTHORIZING PROCESS ABOUT ASSISTING THOSE WHO ARE GOING GAVE IN THISPROCESS AND IT DID IT THERE ARE THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE CURRENT AUTHORIZING PROCESS. THIS BILL DOES NOT SPEAK TO THAT. AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE THAT HAS SORT OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND REPORTING ON EVERY YEAR BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE ANYTHING TELL THE LEN COMES IN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS THAT RIGHT. THAT'S AYE THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN WRITTEN INTO THIS PARTICULAR BILL BUT WHAT I CAN ON A LEAD MS CAPELLA SPEAK TO THIS BUT WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND HOW WE MEASURE THEM WE WILL CONTINUE. DOING THAT WE ACTUALLY. JUST ANECDOTALLY THE FEEDBACK THAT I'VE GOTTEN FROM OTHER SUPERINTENDENTS OR OTHERS WHO ARE. CHARGED WITH AUTHORIZED THING IS THAT. BUT FOR SOME APART FOR FROM CARS NOT APART FROM THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT THEY RECEIVE THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR GRANT. THEY HAVE NO OTHER GODS ARE EMPLOYED. OTHER THAN TO SIT DOWN AND READ STATUTE ABOUT WHAT IS REQUIRED SO. REALLY ON THE GROUND THIS IT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO THEM AND I WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL. ALLUDED TO US WE ARE NEEDS ARE WE WE ARE AGNOSTIC. IN THE PROCESS OF WHETHER YOU ARE CHOOSING TO OR NOT TO AUTHORIZE A CHARTER WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE LAW AND BE ABLE TO REVIEW PETITIONS. WITH. USING GOOD PROCESSES AND TOOLS. I WOULD YOU YOU KNOW MINISTER DOLLARS A MORE ASSERTIVE ACT FREQUENT. MEASUREMENT DIDN'T AND REPORTING ON WHAT'S ON HOW THIS IS WORKING OUT UP UNTIL THIS LA A REPORT WHICH CURRENTLY ISN'T SETTLED TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION ANSWER. CHINA. AND IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER YOU CAN SHOOT IT OUT ANSWERED A. QUESTION YOU WANT TO CONFIRM. YEAH LISTEN WERE OPEN ANYTHING DO THE STRENGTH IN THE BILL STRENGTHENED METRICS ASSOCIATE WITH THE EFFORT PRESSURE. I THINK THAT IS THE SIZE. I JUST I JUST WANTED TO. GO NO GO AHEAD IF YOU NOT BEEN SET BUT YOU THINK YOU KNOW I'VE GOT JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. SO I KNOW THAT ALSO PART OF A CAR'S THAT'S BEEN DOING IS NOT PROVIDING KIND OF CALIFORNIA'S. TECHNOLOGY APPS AUTHORIZES IN A WAY THAT'S BEEN REALLY VALUABLE AND LITTLE OR NO COST I'M AND I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT REFLECTED IN. IN IN THIS BILL IS IS IT THE INTENTION TO MAKE THAT AND TO EXPAND THE PRACTICE UNDER THE SPELL ARE YOU TALK ABOUT EPICENTER ENDS IN IN PARTICULAR SO YES. EPICENTER IS A SOFTWARE PLATFORM. THAT WE HAVE OFFERED A TO THE DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO TRACK. THEY ARE. THE PROCESS AND TRACK THE OVERSIGHT. THE ELEMENTS OF THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS THAT THEY ARE CHARGED WITH AS. AUTHORIZING ELEAZAR SO. I'M NOT REALLY SURE OF HOW I'M AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF WE SPECIFIED HOW THAT. COST STRUCTURE WOULD BE. ABSORBED. IN THE FUTURE. BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A TOOL THAT WE USE. TO HELP AUTHORIZES NOW. DO YOU MISTER PALACES OR ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULD ADD TO THAT. NO OTHER THEN YEAH IT WASN'T CALLED OUT SPECIFICALLY BUT IT IS DEFINITELY A TOOL THAT WE USE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONDUCTING ALL OVERSIGHT MONITORING IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER. I THINK YOU GOT TO EVER. JUST GOING TO SIMPLY SAY I APPRECIATE WHAT WHAT. YOU YOU SAID AND I AND I AM PLEASED TO KNOW THAT I I. I CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THE NUMBER ONE CHALLENGE WE FACE IS AUTHORIZING. AND WE GET GOOD AUTHORIZATIONS AND GOOD AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN CHARTERS IN DISTRICTS THAT OF AUTHORIZES A WE HAVE BETTER SUCCESS IN TERMS OF OUTCOME. OF AND LARGE DISTRICTS CAN'T DO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. TO DO THAT THOUGH I KNOW SAN DIEGO HAD A SPECIAL OFFICE A PERSON DID AUTHORIZATIONS AND SO. THEY HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE IN WORK WITH AUTHORIZED OR MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND CHANGES IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND SMALL DISHES DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES SO THEY REALLY NEED TO BECAUSE IF IF YOU KNOW IF THE. THAT THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARLES AND DISTRICTS AUTHORIZES AUTHORIZES NEED TO BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FOR THE DISTRICTS AT THE AUTHORIZING AND UNDERSTAND WHAT AGREEMENTS THEY HAVE. WITHOUT WITH THE CHARTERS AND SO ON ALSO I'M PLEASED TO KNOW THAT IT'S THERE THAT YOU ARE THAT YOU'VE GOT IT WILL BE CONTINUING AND THAT WE SHOULD OBVIOUSLY TAKE UP THE SLACK OF OF FUNDING IT AT THIS POINT. BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AND AS CHARLES GROW WHAT IT'S GOING TO EVEN BE MORE IMPORTANT THEY HAVE SOME TRAINING IN INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. US I THINK IT'S GREAT I I I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD MOTION BUT I OF. LIEU THE BILL. THERE'S A. HOW WE HAVE MOTION A SECOND IS TO PASS? TO APPROPRIATIONS. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
