LEGALLY POSSESS A GUN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THOSE. THOSE MISDEMEANORS ARE THE CARRYING OF A CONCEALED FIREARM -- THE UNLICENSED CARRYING OF A LOADED FIREARM AS WELL AS THE OPEN CARRYING OF AN UNLOADED HANDGUN. SO IF YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF THOSE MISDEMEANORS THIS BILL WOULD ADD YOU TO THE APP'S LIST AND MAKE YOU SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT FROM DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF THAT FIRE.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATURAL SOCIO ASIAN -- ALSO HERE FOR A GUN OWNERS STUCK IN THE LINE OUTSIDE -- WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- THIS EXPANDS. THE FARMS PROHIBITION TO NON VIOLENT CRIMES REGARDING THE TRANSPORTATION OF FIREARMS TO INCLUDE A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION. FOR YEARS LAWS -- CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED IN FACT WE HAVE A BOOK ON FIREARMS LAWS IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED PAGES. OF THE TRANSPORTATION LAWS CAN BE -- CAN BE A LITTLE BIT ONEROUS AND WE HAVE NEW LAWS THAT ARE COMING ON STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION. I'M INCLUDING CERTAIN DEVICES THAT WOULD NEED TO BE INSTALLED IN CARS -- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE MIGHT VIOLATE THIS IN LOSE THEIR FIREARMS RIGHTS MAYBE THAT A RENTAL CAR OR THEY'RE JUST ON FAMILIAR -- IN IN -- IN ADVERSELY VIOLATE THIS AND SO -- WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WE FEEL THAT -- BETTER TIME WILL BE SPENT GOING AFTER THE CRIMINAL MISUSE OF FIREARMS NOT ON THOSE WHO MIGHT INADVERTENTLY PILOT Là THANK YOU.

YOU KNOW WE WE DO NEED CLARITY AROUND GUN TRANSPORTATION LAWS IN ANYONE HE'S. YOU KNOW BITING BY OUR RULES IN OUGHT TO BE ENTITLED TO THAT POSITION TO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT -- SO WE'RE NOT AND TRIED TRYING TO IMPEDE ON THAT PER SE. WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF SE THE STANDARD PROBATION PERIOD IS NOT A LIFETIME BAN BY THE WAY THERE'S SOME FELONIES THAT ARE SUBJECT A LIFETIME BANS FEDERALLY AND STATE. WE WE PICK THE NUMBER THAT SORT OF WAS IN A RANGE OF OTHER RELATED CRIMES -- I DO AGREE THERE MAY NEED TO BE CLARITY ON THE TRANSPORT REQUIREMENTS BUT I DON'T WANNA ARBITRARILY -- INSULATE THOSE WHO ARE VIOLATING GUN LAWS FROM BEING ON THE APPS LIST IT SEEMS LIKE A A GAP IN IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM -- IF OTHER MISDEMEANORS ARE FELONIES THAT ARE NOT THEY'RE NOT ALL VIOLENT CRIMES OR EVEN CRIMES OF INTENT PER SE -- SO WE FELT LIKE THIS WAS A REASONABLE BALANCE AND EVENTUALLY YOU CAN GO BACK TO POSSESSING THAT THAT WEAPON THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW.

WITH THAT WORK FOR YOU. GREAT GO AHEAD [inaudible] YEAH. VERY MUCH ABOUT A YEAR AND OKAY. NO. ONE FOR YEAH OVER. THE DUCKS TWO THINGS FROM THE LAW CRIMINAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND RELATED CIVIL ASSESSMENTS. CRIMINAL JUSTICE FEES POST THREE MAIN PROBLEMS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS RESIDENTS NUMBER ONE THERE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT CHARGE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO. RARELY COULD AFFORD TO PAY THEM TO THEY CREATE BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY AND THREE THEY ARE A REGRESSIVE SOURCE OF REVENUE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN A BILL THAT I HAD THE PLEASURE OF COOPER IN SENATE BILL ONE NINETY ELIMINATED YOU LITTLE FEES. THE COST OF COLLECTIONS WITH OVERLY BURDENSOME TO COUNTIES AND FAMILIES ALIKE. SO MUCH SO THAT ALL OF THE COUNTIES ARE FINANCIALLY BETTER OFF NOT COLLECTING THOSE FEES IN FACT MANY COUNTIES ONE ABOVE AND BEYOND AND THEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BE NINETY AND FORGIVEN. BACK -- THIEF. AND A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF PROBATION FEES IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS OUT REQUESTS WERE SENT TO ALL FIFTY A COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. REPRESENTING NEARLY 95% OF OUR STATE'S TOTAL POPULATION. RESPONSES SHOW THAT MOST COUNTIES DO NOT TRACK COLLECTION FEES SUGGESTING THAT THE FEES ARE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO COUNTY BUDGETS. THOSE THAT DID TRACK COLLECTION FEES REVEAL LOCAL ELECTION RATES AND A HIGH COST OF COLLECTION. COLLEAGUES I REPEAT THEY REPORT LOW COLLECTION RATES BUT A HIGH COST OF COLLECTION. LAST YEAR CASE IN POINT THE SITTING KIND OF SAN FRANCISCO BY WAY OF THEIR FINANCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT PUBLISHED A REPORT ENTITLED. CRIMINAL JUSTICE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES HI PAIN FOR PEOPLE LOW GAIN FOR GOVERNMENT A CALL TO ACTION FOR CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. AS A RESULT SAN FRANCISCO ABOLISHED ALL LOCALLY IMPOSE FEES AND MOVED TO DIS CHARGE ALL LOCAL IMPOSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEPT. LAST WEEK THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AGREE TO EXAMINE THEIR APPLICATION OF FINES FEES AND PENALTIES AND DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ELIMINATING SOME OR ALL OF THEIR OWN FINDS. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR THE US SUPREME COURT RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THE PROHIBITION IN THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION RELATING TO EXCESSIVE FINES DOES IN FACT. APPLY TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEREBY LIMITING THEIR ABILITIES TO IMPOSE FINES AND SEIZE PROPERTY. I APPRECIATE ALWAYS AS A FORMER COMMITTEE CONSULTANT MYSELF ON THE FEDERAL WORK AND RESEARCH DONE THAT THAT CONSTITUTES THE ANALYSES ON THAT WE RECEIVE IN POLICY COMMITTEES. HAVING SAID THAT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I I THINK DISAGREED IN THEORY WITH THE FOCUS OF THE COMMENTS -- REFLECTED IN SEVERAL PAGES ON THE ANALYSIS THAT. IN IT IN GENERAL I THINK SUGGEST -- A PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT IN TERMS OF WHETHER FEES ARE PROPRIA ON WHETHER -- PEOPLE TOUCH BY THE CRIMINAL OR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM COULD HAVE -- THE ONUS ON THEIR OWN TO COVER THOSE COSTS. I'LL JUST TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THEM -- IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED -- IT WAS RAISED THE QUESTION WAS POSED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT -- WHAT THE QUESTION WAS PULSE HOW MANY OF THE FEES WE ELIMINATE ARE CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY COUNTIES? OUT OF FIFTY FOUR COUNTIES FOR WHICH FEE SCHEDULES WERE AVAILABLE THE MOST COMMON FEES ASSESS OUR PROBATION SUPERVISION INVESTIGATION REPORTS ELECTRONIC MONITORING WORK ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS AND DRUG TESTING. THE QUESTION WAS POSED THE FEES RELATED TO ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY FOR EXAMPLE HOME DETENTION ELECTRONIC MONITORING WORK FULL OR ELIMINATED WELL ALTERNATIVE COFFEE STILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL COUNTY FAIR QUESTION -- TO EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA ELIMINATED FEES CHARGED IN SHARE OF THE WORK IN THEIR SHARES WORK ALTERNATE. AND SERVICES SCHOOL LIMITED FEES CHARGED FOR ANKLE MONITORING AND NEITHER COUNTY ELIMINATED ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY OPTIONS ON ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE CUTS THE OPTION SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDED ON INDIVIDUALS WELL WE ALSO FEEL STRONGLY THAT THE COUNTIES I UNDERSTAND THE VALUE IN THE COST SAVINGS ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMS. AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT ELIMINATED IT ELIMINATE THOSE PROGRAMS. IF. THEY COULD NO LONGER CHARGE -- THE DEFENSE THE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT SUBJECT TO THOSE PROGRAMS THE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM -- AGAIN I THINK IT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE BELIEVE THAT. SOMEONE TOUCHED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- WE'LL SEE THE FEE AS A AS A REASON TO NOT BE ENGAGED IN THE ACTIVITY THAT GOT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE AW AW I THINK THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE RESEARCH TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. HERE WITH ME TODAY MADAM -- CHAIR TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL -- INCLUDES STEPHANIE COMPOST BELIEVE A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY IN THE POLICY ADVOCACY CLINIC AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW AND MATTHEW TRAPPED IN THERE WITH THE AIR SEE THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION.

DURING THE TIME FOR MY CRIME AND YOU KNOW FINDING MY FAITH IN GOD AND AND REALLY JUST WORKING ON MYSELF AS A HUMAN BEING. THAT. HE KNOW MY ACTIONS WERE WRONG WHAT I DID WAS BASED OFF THE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I AM IN DOLLARS A KID. AND YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING IN MY LIFE. FROM THE BEGINNING UNTIL THAT POINT AFFECTED ME AS A HUMAN BEING TO THE POINT WHERE I MADE A HORRIBLE DECISION TO TAKE ANOTHER HUMAN BEING'S LIFE FACE OFF MY OWN. ANGER HATRED FRUSTRATION TOWARDS MY LIFE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW. A LOT OF THE USE THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS INCARCERATED AND EVEN MY ME MYSELF I WAS.

YOU KNOW THERE'S TONS OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HINDERED ME FROM POSITIVE GROWTH BEFORE I HAD GOTTEN INCARCERATED. AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT UP LEADING UP TO ME. YOU KNOW LIVING A LIFE OF CRIME AND DOING THE THINGS THAT I DID AND HE KNOWN. GETTING OUT OF PRISON -- I ENDED UP GOING ACTUALLY -- HALFWAY THROUGH MY TIME I DID OF GOING TO A FIRE CAMP OVER IN PINE GROVE I'VE FOUGHT FIRES FOR YEAR AND A HALF.

TO YOU KNOW. JUST FINDING THE MOST VALUE THAT I COULD IN MY TIME TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW. BECAUSE EACH ONE OF US AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE THAT GO IN MY HEART THAT. YOU KNOW EVEN KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL ANGRY AND THEY CAN'T GET PAST THEIR THEIR FRUSTRATION THEY STILL FEEL GUILTY THAT WE ALL HAVE A A DIFFERENCE FROM RIGHT FROM WRONG YOU KNOW IN. MY THING IS IS WHEN I GOT OUT OF JAIL I GOT OUT OF PRISON -- IN IN LAST APRIL I ENDED UP. COMING RIGHT OUT OF THERE TO YOU KNOW PROGRESSING LIFE ENDED UP GETTING MARRIED TO MY WIFE RACHEL. AND WE'RE HAVINGA CHILD. I ENDED UP GETTING A JOB. PROPER MEMBER SOCIETY AND REALLY ALL I DO IS GIVE FATE YEAH -- ALL GLORY TO MY GOD JESUS CHRIST AND IN THOSE THINGS BUT WITHOUT MY FAITH FOUNDATION. I NOTICED THAT A MAJORITY OF THE KIDS THAT I KNOW FROM PRISON ARE EITHER DEAD. HAVE RECOMMITTED THEIR FENCES OR HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE. TO THE NO -- IN OTHER MEAN ADD THROUGH THERE ARE COMING OUT OF THE THE PRISON RIGHT FROM GOING IN THROUGH THOSE NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCES TO GOING IN. FOR THEIR CRIME THEY CAME OUT. INTO THE SAME SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY WERE IN BEFORE ON TOP OF THAT THEY HAD. YOU KNOW RESTITUTION FINES FROM THEIR VICTIMS WHICH IS YOU KNOW ALL UNDERSTOOD. YOU KNOW WE WE OWE THAT MONEY TO OUR VICTIMS WE ACTUALLY MORE THAN. THAT TO THEM BUT ON TOP OF THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF RUMORED JUVENILES CHILDREN. KIDS. COMING OUT OF PRISON YOU KNOW GOING INAT YOUR SOME OF THEM AT TWELVE YEARS OLD GETTING OUT OF TWENTY ONE HAVING NO FOUNDATION HAVING NO PARENTS HAVING NO. ONE AND THEN HAVING ON TOP OF THE YOU KNOW. IT'S A GOOD GOD THAT I HAD -- A JOB WILLOWS INCARCERATED TO PAY OFF THREE QUARTERS OF MY RESTITUTION WHILE I WAS IN THERE. SO LIKE EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE A FAMILY IN IN SUPPORT THEM THE RIGHT WAY THAT I NEEDED TO AND AND DO THE THINGS THAT I NEEDED TO DO TO REHABILITATE IN SOCIETY. YOU KNOW THOSE THE THAT AND ACTUALLY MINISTRY FEES TO ON TOP OF MY RESTITUTION. BECAME. IN A REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY DON'T EVEN GIVE YOU A FULL -- LIKE. THEY DON'T GIVE YOU FULL KNOWLEDGE OF VERYTHING THAT YOU -- UNTIL YOU DIE OUT AND THEN YOU START FIGURING OUT THAT YOU HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE OVER.

GOT OUT OF PRISON ACTUALLY NOW THEY'RE GROWN MEN GOT OUT OF PRISON. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THEMSELVES THEY JUST LEARN HOW TO GET A JOB. RIGHT EVERY SINGLE BIT OF THEIR MONEY WAS GOING TOWARDS THESE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES THAT ALREADY PAID OFF THE RESTITUTION. YOU KNOW AND IT WAS JUST REALLY DIFFICULT ENOUGH FROM GOING FROM YOU KNOW. REPRESENTS SYSTEM TO LEARNING HOW TO BECOME A PROPER MEMBER SOCIETY TO GOING OUT INTO SOCIETY TO LEARN HOW TO APPLY THOSE THINGS. AND TO HAVE. EXTRA LIKE FINANCIAL THE BECAUSE WE ALREADY WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT LIVING OUT HERE AS IT IS HONESTLY I WOULD YOU KNOW. THEN YOU'RE WORKING TWO JOBS NOW ON TOP OF MY WIFE AND IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT IT'S HARD. AND ON TOP OF THAT I'M HAVING TO PAY MY OKAY I'M I'M HAVING A HARD TIME PAYING MY ADMINISTRATIVE FEES AND ALL THOSE THINGS SO. I FIND IT REALLY PROFITABLE IF -- YOU KNOW. THIS BILL WOULD GET PASSED BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST HELP US ALL OUT. YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON SKINNER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS STEPHANIE COMBO SPRAY AND I AM A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY IN THE POLICY ADVOCACY CLINIC AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW. IN SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE'VE BEEN RESEARCHING THE ARRAY OF FEES THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY JUST PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEMS AND COURTS IMPOSE ON PEOPLE. AS DISCUSSED IN RECENT DECISIONS BY THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS IN THE US SUPREME COURT MONETARY SANCTIONS LIKE FEES ARE NOT MEANT TO FURTHER ANY PENAL OBJECTIVES. BUT THEY'RE RATHER JUST ONLY THERE TO AUGMENT THE STATE'S REVENUE. AND YET FEES OFTEN DON'T EVEN DO THIS SINCE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGE FEES CANNOT PAY DUE TO THEIR INDIGENCE. EVEN STILL THE MAJORITY OF COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH NOT REQUIRED CHARGE FEES. AS A RESULT FEW TYPES AND MOUNTS AND PRACTICES VARY WIDELY ACROSS THE STATE. FOR EXAMPLE AN ORANGE COUNTY AND IT'S ALL ON PROBATION FOR FIVE YEARS CAN BE CHARGED OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SUPERVISION AND AN INVESTIGATION REPORT. BUT JUST MILES OVER IN NEIGHBORING RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT SAME PERSON WILL BE CHARGED SIXTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ONCE IMPOSES FEES AREN'T JUST BILLS THAT DISAPPEAR WITH TIME THEY ARE ORDERED AS CIVIL JUDGMENTS WHICH CAN BE ENFORCED BY FRED THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD VIA TAX REBATE INTERCEPT AND WAGE GARNISHMENT. AND THESE FEES DISPERSED DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. DUE TO OVER POLICING AND TARGET POLICING IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ARE PUNISHED MORE FREQUENTLY AND HARSHLY AT A VARIETY OF DISCRETION POINTS WHICH ONLY LEADS TO HIGHER FEE BURDENS. AND FEES ARE INTENDED TO HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RECOUP COSTS COUNTIES OFTEN RECOVER ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF WHAT THEY A SASS. FOR EXAMPLE IN LA COUNTY ONLY 4% OF PROBATION FEES ON ACTIVE CASES WERE COLLECTED. AND RECORDS ALSO SHOW THAT IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE COUNTY SPENT THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO COLLECT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS RESULTING IN A HALF OF A MILLION DOLLAR LOSS. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS COUNTRY ON FEES NATIONALLY THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR STATE COURTS AND THE US CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION HAVE ALL WAIT AND AND THEY ALL AGREE WITH THE OVER FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE SPELL. THAT WE MUST ELIMINATE AND REDUCE FEES THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES. OKAY THAT THE MIGRATION -- YOU CAN JUST.

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING -- WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE -- TO THE AUTHORS OF GOAL HERE OF TRYING TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF FIGHTING FINES AND FEES ON THE MOST VULNERABLE HOWEVER WE DO SEE THAT IN THE LEGISLATION. THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE SECTIONS THAT STRIKE OUT THE INDIGENT PROGRAM WHICH IS THE INDUSTRY SUBSIDY -- FOR WHERE THE INDUSTRY'S PAYING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THE DEVICES. FOR THOSE THAT ARE CONVICTED OF A DO YOU WHY. AND THE BUILDING FOR DEFENDER TO ACTUALLY PAY WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR AND WITH OUR STAFF AND SO WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THAT WORK AND HAVE THE ISSUE RESOLVED -- AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS SO UP LOOK FOR THE WORKING THE AUTHOR TO CORRECT THAT -- THAT LANGUAGE THANK YOU GREAT SO THAT'S OUR BETWEEN -- SO NOW WHO. ARE THERE ARE TWO MAIN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THAT WANT TO COME TO THE TABLE. OKAY NO WORRIES NO WORRIES WE KNOW THERE'S A BIG LINE OUTSIDE SO. SORRY. ARE YOU CAN PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ASPEN ALSO THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE RURAL COUNTIES OUT. HIS ME THE RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND BELIEVE THIS IS A WORTHY POLICY CONVERSATION TO BE HAD WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS -- WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE RESULT OF A LOT OF VERY COMPLEX LAYERING OF A VARIETY OF FEES FINES AND ASSESSMENTS -- CENTER MITCHELL'S BILL DEALS WITH A SPECIFIC SET OF FEES ARE OPPOSITION RELATES ONLY TO THE ASPECT THAT THERE IS A REVENUE THAT COMES TO COUNTIES TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS. SO ARE OPPOSITION IS CONNECTED TO THE FACT THAT WE WOULD REQUEST AN ACCOMPANYING ASSESSMENT OF WHAT THAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE WHAT THE FINANCIAL -- RESULTING FINANCIAL IMPACT WOULD BE TO COUNTIES AND THINK THAT THAT IS A A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THIS POLICY CONVERSATION WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE ARE. THERE ARE REAL HUMAN -- CONSEQUENCES THAT RESULT FROM THESE FEES AND THAT'S THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT AS WELL ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION AND REQUESTING A FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE POLICY. AT THAT IS BEHIND THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JESSICA SEVEN TEN THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION -- I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THE SPONSORS FOR HAVING NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH US TO DISCUSS THIS LEGISLATION. I WILL BE BRIEF GIVEN THAT OUR OPPOSITION IS FOUNDED. PRIMARILY ON THE FISCAL IMPACT SAID ABOUT ONE FORTY FOUR RATHER THAN THE POLICY. AND WHAT WE DO THINK THIS IS A VALUABLE CONVERSATION -- THIS LONG OVERDUE WE THINK THAT IMPORTANT PART OF THE DISCUSSION IS FINDING SPECIFICALLY BATTLE FOR LOST REVENUE. AND SO LIKE I SAID WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS ABOUT BACK. TO GET. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD MANAGER MEMBERS COREY SAYS ALONG BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. CODY WILSON BEHALF OF THE CHEAPER BASED OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SO -- I'M GONNA START AND THEN I CALL ON YOU -- CENTER JACKSON IF THERE'S ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO SENATOR MORE LAUGHTER RIGHT ARM. TO APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS BILL. AND AT THE POINT THAT WE TAKE A MOTION I'LL ASK YOU IF -- IF AT ANY POINT THAT IT'S AMENDED IF I CAN BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR -- SO YOU -- I I UNDERSTAND. WHY THE -- DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATIONS CAME TO THE TABLE ON OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE AS WAS POINTED OUT THE UTILIZE -- THESE FINES AND FEES TO COVER COSTS. NOW INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH -- IF WE LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT SERVICES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES [inaudible] THERE. WE DO NOT ASSESS A FEAR OF FINE FOR EVERY SINGLE SERVICE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES. NOW CLEARLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STILL HAVE TO OPERATE -- BUT WE'VE SEEN THIS GROWTH IN FEES AND FINES ON ALL ALL NATURE AREAS -- WHETHER IT'S TRAFFIC TICKETS OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. DUE TO THE FACT THAT -- IT BASICALLY RISEN SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP THIRTEEN BECAUSE THEIR CORE REVENUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WAS GUTTED AT THAT TIME AND SINCE THAT TIME. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE UP [inaudible] AND UNFORTUNATELY MOST FEES AND FINES NOT ALL BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE. TO DO WITH ANY TYPE OF INCARCERATION INFRACTION OR CRIMINAL. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY ON LOW INCOME PEOPLE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO GET CONVICTED IN THE FIRST PLACE -- AND DIED WE WE DON'T NEED TO RE HASH THAT DATA THAT DATA IS WELL BEFORE US IN IS SUBSTANTIATED. BY MORE THAN -- THAT BY MOST EVERY BIT OF RESEARCH THAT IS DONE. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD BE FRUSTRATED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE THESE REVENUE SOURCES CUT OFF. I THINK THAT WE HAVE FOUND. THAT. THE COVERING OF THESE COSTS IN THIS WAY IS NOT A BENEFIT TO THE SOCIETY AT LARGE AND WHEN WE HEAR FROM A WITNESS LIKE THE GENTLEMAN WHO REPRESENTED ARC. WHO TALKS ABOUT? AFTER SERVING HIS TIME. AND DOING -- WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM? DUE TO THE CRIME HE COMMITTED. BEING RELEASED AND THEN FINDING. THAT HE HAS -- SIGNIFICANT COSTS THAT HE NOW HAS TO COVER WHICH IS WE KNOW YOU ALREADY IF YOU COME OUT OF ANY FOR OF INCARCERATION WHETHER IT'S COUNTY DEALER STATE PRISON. YOU HAVE AN ALBATROSS AROUND YOUR NECK YOU'RE ALREADY DISADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF GETTING EMPLOYMENT IN TERMS OF ANY NUMBER OF THINGS TO TO BE ABLE TO PROPERLY. REINTEGRATE INTO A COMMUNITY. AND TO ADD TIS ADDITIONAL BURDEN. I THINK IS -- JUST IT IT DOES NOT SERVICE IT IT CREATES IT HELPS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE HIGH AMOUNTS OF RECIDIVISM THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MEANING PEOPLE RETURNING BACK TO JAIL AND PRISON. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO STOP THIS REVOLVING DOOR SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THE MEASURE. AND I THINK THAT WERE WE AS AND AS A FORMER REPRESENTATIVE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO START FIGURING OUT. HOW TO PROVIDE OUR SERVICES WITHOUT CHARGING THESE TYPE OF PEACE AND NOW I THINK THAT'S JUST A BASIC REALITY OR WE NEED TO FIX? CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER REVENUE PROBLEMS SO -- ANYWAY DEPRECIATED AND CENTER JACKSON THEN CENTER MORE LACK AND I DON'T KNOW IF MISTER BRADFORD HE WENT OUT GO HEAD CENTER JACKSON THANK YOU -- I WNT TO THANK THE YOUNG MAN WHO CAME AND TESTIFIED ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE AND CONGRATULATIONS ON TURNING YOUR LIFE AROUND VISITS A HEARTFELT STORY AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT I THINK IS FOR INSPIRING. FOR US TO HEAR WHEN IT BE WONDERFUL IF. YOUR CHILDHOOD HEAD -- BEEN A MORE STABLE -- ONE INCIDENT THAT EXPERIENCE WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED EITHER FOR YOU OR THAT. THE A YOUNG PERSON WHOSE LIFE WAS SIR. WAS -- LOST. UP MY CONCERN HERE AND I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT THE CHAIR HAS SAID BUT MY CONCERN IS -- REALLY IT LOOKING AT SORT OF THE FINANCIAL ASPECT FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW IN MY COMMUNITIES -- WE HAVE PROGRAMS FOR PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHERE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANGER MANAGEMENT. AND THEY HAVE TO PAY THE COST OF THOSE PROGRAMS BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT WE ARGUABLY WOULDN'T HAVE THOSE PROGRAMS. AND SOLD I WONDER IF YOU COULD RESPOND -- TO THAT CONCERN A REALIZING SOME OF HIS IS-BUDGETARY BUT THERE IS -- SORT OF A SORT OF A AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT IF IF ONE HAS ANGER MANAGEMENT. PROBLEMS FOR EXAMPLE AND RESULT IN DOMESTIC ABUSE WHICH OF COURSE WE DON'T. SUPPORT AND WANT TO READ A CAKE -- ATTENDING A PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL ADDRESS AND OVERCOME THOSE. ISSUES ARE COST MONEY. AND WE BASICALLY SAY AS SOMEONE WHO ARE COMMITTED THAT ACT YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUPPORT THE MECHANISM THAT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED TO YOU TO OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM. OF WE TAKE AWAY THAT FEE IF YOU WILL -- HOW DO WE HOW DO WE THEN GO ABOUT ENSURING THAT THESE PROGRAMS CONTINUE AND THE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES? OF THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATOR JACKSON FOR THE QUESTION AND AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS REALLY TWO FOLD YOU KNOW. IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ASSUME THAT THE ASSESSMENT OF FINES AND FEES ARE INDEED A DETERRENT. AND WHEN WE SAY YOU'RE MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE -- WERE IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HEAR. ARE AT ARE FAMILIAR WITH PENAL CODE -- THAT SUGGESTS THAT WE DO HAVE A SYSTEM IN WHICH PEOPLE -- PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND PAID THEIR DEBT TO A VICTIM THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH RESTITUTION I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE IN AS THE MADAM CHAIR SUGGESTED. THERE'S NO WHERE ELSE IN GOVERNMENT IN THE PROVISION OF SERVICES THAT GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR THAT WE IN EFFECT ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL TAX. ON OUR RESIDENTS TO COVER THOSE COSTS -- WE HAVE THE SAME HERE DURING THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD WHEN OUR BUDGET WAS. REALLY DIFFICULT WE WERE CUTTING. CRITICAL SERVICES THAT WE SHOULDN'T BALANCE THE BUDGET ON THE BACKS OF POOR PEOPLE. IF YOU COULD SHOW ME A COUNTY WHERE THE COLLECTION OF FEES. ACTUALLY EXCEEDS THE COST TO COLLECT IT. TO CHARGE ADDITIONAL I'D AN ADDITIONAL PERCENT FOR THE COLLECTION PROCESS -- I THINK THAT'S EXCESSIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE. ALL WE ARE OPEN TO CONTINUING TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL CASES BUT I JUST THINK ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAVE TO HAVE A FOR THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO ENGAGE IN AN ADDITIONAL TAXATION PROCESS FOR A SUBSET OF THE POPULATION -- WHO -- ARE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED. BY GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS -- AND HAVE INDEED PAID THEIR DEBT IF YOU WILL THROUGH INCARCERATION WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE -- HOW WE PAY FOR IT IS A SEPARATE CONVERSATION AND I BELIEVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP UP AND ENGAGE IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT WE DEEM APPROPRIATE -- WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOULD BE ON THE BACKS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOUCHED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT IS WHERE I HAPPEN TO DISAGREE. WELL I AND I AND I APPRECIATE THAT PHILOSOPHICAL DISTINCTION -- I I HAVE A MY ASK IS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE PROGRAMS DEALING WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE LIKE YOURSELF THIS IS BEEN AN AREA I HAVE. BEEN CLAWING AT FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE WE EVEN RECOGNIZE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A CRIME OF COURSE [inaudible] AND RECOGNIZING THAT IN MANY INSTANCES WE HAVE THESE DIVERSION PROGRAM SO THAT THE THAT THE COST THAT PEOPLE PAY IS NOT NECESSARILY INCARCERATION THE GOAL. IS NOT. THIS IS NOT A DETERRENT THIS SITUATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIS IS PAYMENT FOR A PROGRAM THAT IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO CHANGE THAT BEHAVIOR. AND ALSO TO PROTECT LOVED ONES FROM CONTINUED ABUSE. SO. THE ACTUAL COST TO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS AND YOU HAVE TO ATTEND LET'S SAY FIFTY TWO WEEKS ONCE A WEEK FOR TWO OR THREE HOURS. TO ADDRESS WHATEVER THOSE PROBLEMS ARE THAT CAUSE YOU TO TO HURT THE PEOPLE YOU OSTENSIBLY LOVE. TO ME IS NOT AN OUTRAGEOUS COSTED TO ITS. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE COULD IT ALLOWS FOR THE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO IMPROVE AND REDUCE THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR. AND IN MOST INSTANCES THERE'S NO CONCOMITANT. PUNISHMENT THE OF INCARCERATION SO IF YOU WOULD I I RECOGNIZE FEES AND COSTS AND ADD ONS AND SO FORTH AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE BUT I AS I LOOK AT THIS VERY SPECIFIC PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S ONE THAT I HAVE BEEN. SUPPORT OF BOB AND FOLLOWED AND HELP TO ADVANCE -- MY FEAR IS THAT. WE ARE GOING TO SEE THESE PROGRAMS ENDING BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT IS GOING TO BE THERE ISN'T MONEY THERE BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO. HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM ARE NOT GOING TO BE CALLED TO TO SUPPORTED AND TO FUNDED -- I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND I WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE IN AND I THINK A ADD TO YOUR QUESTION BY SUGGEST WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE WHO ARE IN A POSITION. TO PAY THE FEE DO THEY THE NOT BENEFIT FROM THAT PROGRAM THAT AND SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH LIKE WE JUST HAD. LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS IN THIS COMMITTEE AROUND THE BILL SYSTEM WE CONTINUE TO CREATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. GET A DIFFERENT -- KIND OF JUSTICE COMPARED TO THOSE WHO CAN'T. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE A SYSTEM IN WHICH EVERYONE WHO. A JUDGE OR WHOEVER FEELS COULD BENEFIT AND MAY HOLE BY WHATEVER THE DETERRENT IS A DV ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASS WHATEVER THE CASE IS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO IT AND SO WE MUST HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WHETHER YOU CAN PAY. AND I CAN'T SHOULD MATTER IF OUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO CREATE YOU KNOW A EIGHT CALIFORNIA WHERE A DV IS NO MORE. SO IF I MAY HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION TO FOLLOW UP ON THIS SO. UNDER THIS BILL WOULD THERE STILL BE AND FREQUENTLY THE COURTS HAVE A SLIDING SCALES BASED UPON WHAT PEOPLE CAN AND CANNOT AFFORD. WE PROVIDE JUSTICE TO PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD. THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL WE PROVIDE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER ALTERNATE ALTERNATE COUNCIL -- WOULD THAT BE -- IT WOULD THAT CONTINUE UNDER THIS PROGRAM SO IF SOMEONE IS INDIGENT AS YOU ARE I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ESSENTIALLY SO WITH THEN YOU CAN'T QUALIFY BUT HAVE A SLIDING SCALE SO THAT PEOPLE PAY WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO AND IF THEY'RE NOT WE STILL WANT TO GET THAN ANGER MANAGEMENT. BUT AT LEAST THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT -- OR IF AFFORD SOME PERCENTAGE OF THAT STILL BE -- EXPECTED TO TO TO DO THAT UNDER THIS DEAL. ALL SIDES AND AND THAT'S BASICALLY RESEARCH THAT WHILE KIND OF THIS THEORY AND MAYBE IN THE IN THE CASE OF CAPTAIN YORK COUNTY ARE WITH REGARD. TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ANGER MANAGEMENT TRAINING YOU KNOW THE THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT THAT IT IS NOT PEOPLE OF ME. THAT ARE TOUCHED BY THE SYSTEM. OFF IN LARGE PART IT IS NOT AND TRAGICALLY EVEN THOUGH CURRENT COLD CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT TO NOT BE CHARGED. THAT IS FLAWED AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE COUNTIES CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD IN CHARGE IN THE CASE OF SB ONE NINETY WE HAD. AMAZING RESEARCH THAT SHOWED -- THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT IGNORED THE INDIGENT KIND OF OPT OUT FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE CASE ACROSS THE STATE SO THAT CURRENT PROTECTION IN LAW IS A PROTECTING THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. IT'S JUST NOT. WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I DO. HI I'M KINDA TORN I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT. TO I DON'T WANT TO SEE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS DISAPPEAR BECAUSE ARGUABLY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING FOR IT I UNDERSTAND THAT AND AND WHAT WELL THERE'S CERTAINLY NO GUARANTEES I THINK THE WORK. THAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE PUT IN PLACE FOR YEARS AROUND MAKING THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS ARE NORM -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE TO ATTEST THAT THOSE KINDS OF THE VERSION PROGRAMS ARE COST SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE TO TO SAVE IN TERMS OF INCARCERATION THAT DOUBT THOSE DOLLARS AND SENSE MAKES SENSE. ALL AND I WOULD. REFER YOU BACK AGAIN TO THE EXAMPLES I GAVE IN MY OPENING THAT THERE ARE TWO COUNTY SERVICES ONE ALAMEDA. WHO WILL LIMIT THE FEES WHO -- IN THE AREAS OF THE VERSION -- PROGRAMS ARE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES I BELIEVE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE COST EFFECTIVE [inaudible] AND AGAIN. WE CANNOT FIND COUNTIES WHO -- THE MONEY THEY BRING IN AS A RESULT OF CHARGING THE FINES AND FEES EXCEEDS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR COLLECTING THEM. WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED THESE FEES DO NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO PAY? AND THE FEES CONTINUE TO GROW AND THE COUNTESS CONTINUE TO EXPEND RESOURCES IN TRYING TO GET BLOOD FROM A TURNIP. THANK YOU ARE. THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD ANALOGY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK. NINE CENTER WIENER YOU WANTED TO SPEAK OKAY CENTER MORE LIKE. THAT I'M SURE THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU -- FOR THIS MAKES OUTSTANDING DEBT FROM A LIMITED COURT FEES NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE AS OF JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY SO. YOUR DEBT IS FORGIVEN -- THAT SHOULD GIVE MATTHEW TRACTOR A WHOLE NEW APPRECIATION FOR FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS. SO I AM IN CURIOUS WE HAVE TO COUNTIES THAT HAVE TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO SAY THIS DOESN'T PENCIL OUT -- AND SINCE I DO PREFER LOCAL CONTROL WHY ARE WE IN A SENSE FORCING FIFTY SIX COUNTIES TO ELIMINATE FEES WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION BASED ON THEIR OWN ANALYTICS TO SAY. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHAT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. I JUST IN OUR EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A IT'S A STATEWIDE POLICY THAT'S KIND OF APPLIED EQUALLY ACROSS THE STATE I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERSPECTIVE BUT I THINK WE'RE USING THOSE EXAMPLES OF COUNTIES. A LARGE COUNTY LA COUNTY IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM LA COUNTY DID I'M STEP UP ON SB ONE NINETY BEFORE IT BECAME STATE LAW. AND ELIMINATE FINES AND FEES FOR JUVENILES ON WE WERE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE COST SAVINGS -- AND THAT KIND OF THE THE HUMAN SAVINGS -- WITH THAT BUT LIKE WITH AT LIKE SB -- ONE NINETY THE ADVOCATES THAT YOU'VE HEARD -- TESTIFIED THE RESEARCH THAT'S COME OUT OF THE BERKELEY -- LAW SCHOOL A CLINIC SUGGESTED A STATEWIDE POLICY REALLY IS WHAT'S BEST FOR ALL RESIDENTS OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I KIND OF OPERATE FROM THE WHILE ONE TWO VERSES HAVE TO APPROACH THAT THAT I GOT YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WHO WERE TOUCHED BY THE SYTEM. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT -- WILL WE HAVE COUNTY BY COUNTY -- KIND OF REQUIREMENTS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO KIND OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE -- AND SO I I HEAR YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND AND YOU SHARE THAT OFF AND I JUST HAPPEN TO BELIEVE. AS DO -- THE THE VERY LARGE COALITION ON A REALLY KIND OF THE NATION WIDE -- NEW FOCUS AROUND THE THE TRUE VALUE OF FINES AND FEES REALLY THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE STATEWIDE STRATEGY THE STATEWIDE. APPROACH SO MAYBE. GOING BACK TO SENATOR JACKSON'S COMMENTS WHY NOT WE ESTABLISH MAY BE A FEE SCHEDULE SO YOU HAVE. MAXIMUM SO YOU DON'T HAVE ELEVEN THOUSAND AND ONE KALYAN SIXTY NINE HUNDRED ANOTHER COUNTY. AND INDEED THAT IS A COMPROMISE WHERE YOU GET THESE FEES I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH THE WHOLE SLIDING SCALE CONCEPT IS OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE. CARVE OUT TO PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT IS IT WORKING. AND SELL TO THEN LAYER ON TOP OF AN EXPECTATION AROUND THE COUNTIES A BILLING A ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO THE END -- OPERATIONALIZE A SLIDING SCALES GADGIL -- I'M TIRED OF THE GRIDLOCK AND CAUGHT SOME TALK AND UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE FORMALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE CURRENTLY IN TERMS OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY AT ALL AND IT'S NOT WORKING. POOR PEOPLE WHO WHO BASED ON CURRENT LAW SHOULD BE WEIGHED SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THE FEES ARE BEING CHARGED. IN CENTER JACKSON RECOVERED SO I WON'T ASK AGAIN BUT A FORGIVENESS POLICY OR A YOU KNOW. THOSE ARE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT OF STOP THEIR MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE IT [inaudible] CENTER WIENER. I THANK YOU ROGER -- STRONG SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR CARING AND IT'S NOT ONLY A SYMPTOM OF OUR OUR BROKEN CROWN JUSTICE SYSTEM BY. IT IS A A SYMPTOM OF OUR FAILURE TO HAVE -- ADEQUATE PROGRESSIVE TAXATION AND THE STATE THAT WE WE RELY ON THE ON FEES AND FINES AND PENALTIES. TO FUNDS GOVERNMENT SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH TAXES AND THEN THAT ENDS UP FALLING ON LOW INCOME PEOPLE SO. I THIS IS A GOOD START. ONE QUESTION THOUGH IN TERMS OF THE CONCERN WAS RAISED ABOUT THE IGNITION INTERLOCK DEVICE WHICH OF COURSE WE HAD A BILL WHAT TWO WEEKS AGO CENTER OURSELVES -- BILL WHICH WE ARE WHICH I SUPPORTED AND OF THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTED -- CAN YOU JUST COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS -- IMPORT IN AND OF COURSE WE DON'T WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SUBSIDIES FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS BUT IF YOU COULD JUST COMMENT ON THAT OCCASION AS THE OPPOSITE THAT. STATED THAT WE'RE IN CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A COMPANY AGREEMENT BUT BUT WE HAVE OPEN DOOR POLICY WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT THANK YOU IT IS NOT OUR GOAL -- TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM THAT IS EQUALLY AS FAR AS THE CURRENT ONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH IT. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION. IN THE LAST COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE IT SOUND. THERE WAS REFERENCE SOMEWHAT BUT NOT ALL OF THESE -- FINDS OUR FEES ARE -- CAN AFFECT SOLD TO A COLLECTION AGENCY BUT VERY COMMONLY WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOW. IS IN EFFECT TURN OVER THE COLLECTION. AND WHEN -- JUST. FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS MORE AROUND AND PARKING AND TRAFFIC FINES. BACK IN THE EIGHTIES WHEN I WAS ON THE BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL. AND WE ASKED FOR AN AUDIT OF WHAT WE WERE ACTUALLY RECOVERING FROM OUR FINES AND FEES WE FOUND THAT WE WERE RECOVERING VERY LOW BECAUSE OF OUR USE OF THESE COLLECTION AGENCIES. AND WHEN WE DID PARKING TICKET AMNESTY WE COLLECTED MORE MONEY. THAN WE MEANING JUST BASICALLY BRING BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LEVEL FEE WITH NO FOR NO PENALTY WE'VE COLLECTED MORE MONEY. THAN WE COLLECTED WITH THE OTHER SYSTEM SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO NOTE THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES IN A AND I THINK THIS IS BEEN REFERENCE IN THIS NOT THE CASE IN EVERYONE OF THESE CATEGORIES BUT IN MANY OF THEM. THEY REALLY -- THEMSELVES ARE NOT RECOVERING THIS REVENUE SO -- ANYWAY MIDDLE MAN YES ONE MORE QUESTION -- I ACTUALLY GO AHEAD. I WONDER SENATOR -- IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING -- TO KEEP IN MIND THIS ISSUE OF THESE PROGRAMS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE VERSION. SO THAT IF IT IS THAT WE CAN. THAT I CAN TAKE COMFORT BECAUSE I SUPPORT THE THE THE NATURE OF THIS BILL. IN THE BUT SOME ASSURANCES THAT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. THROUGH THE BUDGET THROUGH SOME OTHER. RECOURSE. I I WILL BE HEARTSICK TO SEE THESE PROGRAMS DISAPPEAR WE'VE FOUGHT SO HARD TO GET. A CREATED THEY ARE SO IMPORTANT TO TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS THIS EPIDEMIC OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT WE KNOW EXIST THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR AND AND TO SEE BECAUSE OF A GOOD PROGRAMMER GOOD EFFORT LIKE THIS TO SEE ANOTHER GOOD EFFORT. TERMINATED OF WOOD IS IS A LITTLE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR SO WITH YOUR WITH YOUR INSURANCE SO YOU'LL KEEP FIGHTING FOR THIS SITE I WOULD BE WILLING AND ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR FILL. OUT THAT ARE JACKSON I'M IN RECEIPT OF YOUR BUDGET UP PRIORITY ASKED WITH REGARD TO THIS FUNDING I HAVE RECEIVED AND READ IT. US SECONDLY -- I THINK THAT WE'VE. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS SHOWN A HISTORICAL COMMITMENT -- AND AND WE'VE EVEN HAD CONVERSATIONS -- IN RECENT YEARS REALLY ABOUT KIND OF THE CONTENT OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE STILL RELEVANT THAT PEOPLE WHO DO ATTEND ON THE WEATHER NOT THE FIFTY TWO WEEKS IS ADEQUATELY FAT ONGOING CONVERSATION. ON NOT ONLY IN ON THE FUNDING SIDE IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT MAKING SURE THAT THE PROGRAM'S REALLY ARE A MEETING THE GOAL THAT WE ALL HOPE THAT THEY DO IT'S ONE THING TO WANT TO PROTECT THE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN LONG STANDING ON THE BOOK IS ANOTHER THING TO MAKE. SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE RELEVANT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVEN MORE CURRENT RESEARCH IN TERMS OF WHAT AFFECTS BEHAVIOR CHANGE UP I DON'T MY COMMITMENT IS NOT WAVER I DON'T BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT AS A WHOLE IS WAVING WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE THE APPROPRIATE ALTERNATIVES THE APPROPRIATE INVENTION THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING CONTINUE TO EXIST -- AND I'LL STAND ALONGSIDE YOU. ARM I DON'T WANT -- TO AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION AS WE'VE COMMITTED -- WITH THE INTERLOCKING DEVICES TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BUT I DON'T WANT IT LOST ON ANY OF US. THE THE BROADER. CONCEPT OF AROUND WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE TAX RESIDENTS. FOR THE BENEFIT. OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES -- I HEAR YOU AND WE CAN GO THROUGH THIS AND PIECEMEAL AND PULL OUT INDIVIDUAL CASES THAT PEOPLE COULD ARGUE. ON BEHALF OF AGAIN IT IS NOT THE RESEARCH DOES NOT BRING TO BEAR THE NOTION. THAT IT'S A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF MEANS. WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THESE FINES AND FEES THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE AGAIN I WOULD ARGUE THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE? TO THE DELIVERY OF THOSE SERVICES IN THAT TRAINING THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS AND IT'S NOT JUST BASED ON ONE'S ABILITY TO PAY. AND SO TO DO THAT IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE LIKE IF YOU TO STAND WITH YOU WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUE AND RAISING IT THANK YOU. ENSURE WE TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU.

SO -- WE WHILE WE ARE PREPARING FOR ITEM NUMBER -- I MEAN I CAN GO JONES ALRIGHT LET'S GO SENATOR JONES WE CAN -- A RATHER STORY CENTER HILL NAY RUMOR YES WEEK THE NEXT WOULD BE ACTUALLY SB THREE OR FOUR CENTER HILL. WHILE WE WAIT FOR MISS CABALLERO. SB THREE OH FOR ITEM NUMBER. TEN THIRTY HILL YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- GOOD MORNING -- MEMBERS AMEND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO LIMIT CONSOLIDATION TO FEND FELONY FINANCIAL ELDER ABUSE CRIMES COMMITTED IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. SENATE BILL THREE OR FOUR WILL ALLOW DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO CONSOLIDATE ELDERLY AND DEPENDENT ADULTS FRAUD CASES THAT SPAN MULTIPLE COUNTIES INTO A SINGLE PROSECUTION. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION THE BURDEN IS EAST FOR THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF A SUSPECTED SERIAL PERPETRATOR OR PERPETRATORS WHO MUST THEN COPE WITH THE CHALLENGES. OF TESTIFYING MULTIPLE TIMES AND IN MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AS PROSECUTORS TRY THEIR CASE. SB THREE OR FOUR ENSURES THAT THE PROSECUTION WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WRITTEN EVIDENCE THAT ALL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN COUNTIES WITH JURISDICTION AGREED TO THE ONE COUNTY BEING SELECTED ADDITIONALLY THE JUDGES REQUIRED TO WAY. WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE CASES SHOULD BE TRIED IN ONE COUNTY FOR PROSECUTION THE LOCATION AND COMPLEXITY? OF THE LIKELY EVIDENCE WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE OFFENSES OCCURRED THE RIGHTS OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE PEOPLE AND THE CONVENIENCE OF OR HARDSHIP. TO THE VICTIM OR VICTIMS AND WITNESSES BY VIRTUE OF US DEMOGRAPHICS DEPENDENT ADULT AN ELDER ABUSE IS THE FASTEST GROWING AREA OF CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES. AS THE BABY BOOMER GENERATION AGES. FINANCIAL CRIMES AGAINST THE ELDERLY WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR WE SHOULD VERY GOOD THANK YOU WITNESSES SO [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KRISTEN MINIMAL I AM A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE SAN MATEO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE OR FOUR I AM A PROSECUTOR IN THE OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE DIVISION AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT HAS BEEN THE JOY OF MY CAREER TO SERVE THESE VICTIMS. I GET TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING KNOWING THAT I GET TO DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR ONE OF THE VOTE ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SEGMENTS OF OUR SOCIETY. THE ELDERLY AND THE DEPENDENT ADULTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ALL TOO OFTEN I SEE ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS WHO ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE OR BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY. THESE PERPETRATORS SELECT THEM BECAUSE OF THOSE VERY VULNERABILITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE THEIR FRAILTY. THEIR POOR MEMORIES THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING CONFUSED. THEIR DEFICITS AND DETECTING DECEPTION. AND PERHAPS MOST TRAGICALLY. THESE INDIVIDUALS DESIRES TO STILL BE OF USE TO THEIR LOVED ONES INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THE LONELINESS OF THE OFTEN FEEL. AS THEY REACH THE END OF THEIR LIVES. WITH THE EVER INCREASING ELDERLY POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA. THESE CRIMES IN PARTICULAR FINANCIAL CRIMES ARE MORE AND MORE COMMON. BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE BUT UNLIKE OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS SUCH AS CHILDREN. ELDERS INDEPENDENT ADULTS HAVE MONEY THEY HAVE ASSETS THEY HAVE PENSIONS. THEY HAVE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS OFTEN THEY OWN HOMES OR OTHER PROPERTIES. AND THAT MAKES THEM IN THE EYES OF THESE WOULD BE ABUSERS THE PERFECT VICTIMS. SB THREE OR FOUR WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS TO THOSE VICTIMS BY PERMITTING OF THOSE WHO COMMIT FINANCIAL ABUSE IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. TO BE TRIED IN A SINGLE COUNTY. NOT ONLY WILL THIS IMPROVE JUDICIAL ECONOMY IT WILL PREVENT VICTIMS FROM HAVING TO BE INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE PROSECUTIONS WHICH OFTEN INVOLVES TESTIFYING IN MULTIPLE HEARINGS. TRAVELLING TO MULTIPLE COURT ROOMS AND CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL AND DIFFICULT FOR OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY AFFORD THESE PROTECTIONS TO OTHER VULNERABLE VICTIM GROUPS. CHILDREN VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS OF STALKING A SEXUAL ASSAULT. AN OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB THREE OR FOUR ELDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS WILL BE INCLUDED AND THEY WILL GET TO THE EQUAL PROTECTION THAT THEY SOLD. VERY MUCH DESERVED UNDER THIS LAW. YOU MAY BE THINKING OF FINANCIAL CRIMES AGAINST OLDER INDEPENDENT ADULTS ARE DIFFERENT CLASS OF CRIMES. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CRIMES OF VIOLENCE AND THEREFORE LESS SERIOUS AND LESS IMPACTFUL ON THE VICTIMS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM SEEING AND HEARING AND SPEAKING TO THESE VICTIMS THAT THAT COULD NOT BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. I HAVE MET WITH A WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN WHO IS A VERY PROUD SELF SUFFICIENT MEMBER. OF THE GREATEST GENERATION AND I'VE SEEN HIM BREAK DOWN IN TEARS DESCRIBING HOW HE WAS SWINDLED OUT OF MONEY. AND HOW HE WAS GOING TO TELL HIS FAMILY. WHO REVERE HIM AND LOVE HIM? THAT HE FELL FOR SUCH A SCHEME. I'VE SEEN A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO LOSE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. AND WHAT HE BELIEVED WAS AN ATTEMPT TO HELP ANOTHER LESS FORTUNATE IMMIGRANT. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT LOSS HE HAD TO DECIDE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WHETHER TO EAT THREE SQUARE MEALS A DAY OR TO PAY FOR HIS MEDICATION. I'VE SEEN A WIDOW WHOSE WEDDING RING WAS POND. BY SOMEONE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE CARE TAKER. THAT WEDDING RING WAS LOST BECAUSE IT WAS MELTED DOWN FOR GOLD AND THAT WOMAN WILL NEVER GET THAT VALUABLE. PROBABLY THE MOST VALUABLE ITEM SHE OWNS BACK AGAIN. AND I'VE SEEN DEPENDENT ADULTS WHO WHOSE PARENTS BEFORE THEY DIED SET THEM UP TO HAVE A SECURE. HOME BECAUSE THEY COULD NO LONGER WORK. AND TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE BE SWINDLED OUT OF THEIR MONEY AND FORCED TO LIVE. IN CRAMPED CARE HOMES WHEN THEIR FAMILIES THAT AFFORDED. FOR THEM. A BETTER LIFE. AND THE PROBLEM WITH ELDERLY INDEPENDENT VICTIMS IS THAT MOST FREQUENTLY THEY CANNOT WORK. THEY CANNOT MAKE THAT MONEY BACK SO ONCE IT IS GONE IT'S GONE. AND THEY WHO WORKED SO HARD FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO GIVE THEMSELVES PEACE AND SECURITY AND COMFORT. ARE LEFT TO TRY TO PICK UP THE PIECES. THESE FINANCIAL CRIMES WHEN ELDERLY OR DEPENDENT ADULTS ARE VICTIMS ARE DEVASTATING. THEY MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND WE MUST DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO PROTECT THESE VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. WITH SENATE BILL THREE OH FOR YOU TODAY HAVE THE POWER TO DO JUST THAT AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT -- JUMPSTARTED KIA. PUBLIC ADVOCATE OF KERA. OWL. AND HAVING HERE JUST WITHIN SACRAMENTO IN PLASTER COUNTY.

THANK YOU DON KEPT HIM BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. VENTURE MEMBERS CORSO'S ALONG BEHALF FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. MANAGER RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A SEAT. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I AM EXTREMELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISSUE -- MY OWN MOTHER RECENTLY PASSED WAS -- SUFFERING FROM ADVANCING DEMENTIA. AND WE HAD TO DO A LOT -- TO PROTECTOR. HOWEVER -- THIS BILL ADDS YET ANOTHER CRIME TO THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL -- PROSECUTION -- WE'VE HEARD VERY SAD STORIES FROM THE THE PROSECUTOR HERE TODAY AND I AM DEEPLY SYMPATHETIC HOWEVER -- IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A LONG TERM. PUBLIC DEFENDER -- MOST OF THE CASES IF NOT ALL THE CASES THAT WE SAW WERE IN ONE JURISDICTION. AND THERE WAS NO TESTIMONY AND THE REGARDING THE INCIDENTS THAT FROM THE PROSECUTOR THAT ANY OF THESE -- CASES INVOLVED MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS -- WELL I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMENDMENTS CONTEMPLATE MOVING OUT OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT STATUTE. A AND I COULD BE WRONG THE EQUIVALENT JURISDICTIONAL STATUTE IS PENAL CODE SECTION SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR POINT. SEVEN THIS STATUE HAS BEEN EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY -- THREE TIMES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THERE'S TOO MUCH ARE. TOO MUCH HERE WITH THE EXPANSION AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE BENEFITS OF CONSOLIDATION -- IN ONE COUNTY OUTWEIGH THE PROBLEMS TO THE PROSECUTION AND OR THE DEFENSE OR THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE BENEFITS TO THAT YET WE NEED TO PAUSE WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE CHANGES ARE HELPING OR HARMING JUDICIAL ECONOMY. HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY AFFECTING CONVENIENCE OR HARDSHIP TO THE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES INCREASING OR DECREASING OVERALL PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE EXPENSES? AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHETHER THIS ACTUALLY HELPS PUBLIC pBE -- CONTEMPLATED BY SB THREE OH FOUR IS DETRIMENTAL TO A FAIR TRIAL FOR THE DEFENDANT. WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE CHARGES THE JURY OFTEN HAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME PARSING OUT EACH? PARSING OUT OF THE DETAILS OF WEIGHING EACH INDIVIDUAL INCIDENT. SEPARATELY IT ALSO PLACES A VERY HEAVY BURDEN ON THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICES THESE CASES ARE RARELY PRIVATE COUNSEL CASES -- IN THAT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE INVOLVED INVOLVED THE RESOURCES FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES PROSECUTION OFFICES ALL THE DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND THEN FOR THE DEFENSE THERE IS ONLY THE ONE PROSECUTORIAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. AND I COULDN'T AND TELL YOU THAT RECENTLY I TRIED A CASE THAT WAS A SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL -- SIXTY ONE COUNTS FIVE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. ABOUT EIGHT DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND ME -- I WAS AT THAT TIME THE CHIEF -- DEPUTY IN CHARGE OF RUNNING THE MAIN OFFICE OF THE SOLANO COUNTY -- PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. I COULD NOT DO THAT ALL I COULD DO WAS. TRIED TO **** THEM TIME FOR ONE OF THE OTHER FELONY LAWYERS. AND DEVOTE MY FULL ATTENTION TO THE CASE WE DID NOT GET ANY EXTRA HELP -- WITH RESOURCES. FURTHERMORE THE GENERAL IN TIME HONORED RULE IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE KIND OF CRIMINAL TRIAL SHOULD BE HELD IN THE AREA WHERE THEY OCCURRED WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT RULE BUT THEY SHOULD REMAIN JUST THAT. EXCEPTIONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON SB. THREE OH FOUR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION POINTS. ALL RIGHT COMMENT STORE -- YES SENATOR JACKSON'S -- JUST A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE I DO SUPPORT THIS WE ARE AN AGING POPULATION. WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS ABUSE GOING ON WE'VE GOT TO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY OF THESE VICTIMS ARE HAVING COGNITIVE ISSUES -- THEIR HEALTH IS AT RISK. BUT THERE WAS ONE QUESTION THAT COST ME A LITTLE PAUSE. I'M ASSUMING THAT OF ALL OF THE OFFENSES OCCURRED WITHIN ONE JURISDICTION THEN THE MULTI JURISDICTIONAL ASPECT OF THIS DOES NOT. TAKE PLACE IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT ARTS SO IT WOULD HELP. SO WOULD HAVE TO PULL A PLY TOO MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS. A LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS -- I I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THERE IS DATA. SHOWING THE EFFICACY OF THESE KINDS OF PROCEEDINGS THAT SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST KIND OF FLYING BLIND HERE THAT THERE THAT THERE ARE -- IS INDICATION THAT -- THESE KINDS OF EFFORTS THERE WHERE YOU CAN COMPRESS THEM ALL. INTO -- ONE IF YOU KNOW ONE ACTION IF YOU WILL -- IF DOES -- ASSIST THOSE. OLDER VICTIMS WHO ARE BEING VICTIMIZED. AGAIN IF YOU WELL BY HAVING TO GO TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS WHICH HAVE TO BE THERE HARD ON ANYBODY LET ALONE SOMEONE WHO'S GOT ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES TO CONTEND WITH IS THAT CORRECT IS THERE DATA THAT SHOWS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FROM MY YEARS OF PROSECUTING THESE CASES WE HAVE SEEN A VERY LARGE INCREASE ININDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. PERPETRATING CRIMES TARGETING ELDERLY INDEPENDENT ADULTS AND THEN MOVING TO A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION AND DOING THE SAME THING AND THEY ARE RELYING ON THOSE COGNITIVE ABILITIES LACKING. THERE -- AND ABILITIES OF THEIR VICTIMS TO PERHAPS IDENTIFY THE PERPETRATORS TO THEIR FOR BRING THEM TO JUSTICE. AND SO -- I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE SEEING THAT MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY AND RIGHT NOW OUR OFFICE IS PROSECUTING. A NUMBER OF CASES WHERE THE SAME PERPETRATOR HAS TARGETED ELDERLY INDEPENDENT ADULTS IN NEIGHBORING COUNTY SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CLARA ALAMEDA CONTRA COSTA. AND IT IS RIGHT NOW TO THE STATE OF THE LAW IS EXTREMELY ARDUOUS BECAUSE THOSE VICTIMS ARE HAVING TO BE. ESSENTIALLY TRANSPORTED FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY TELLING THEIR STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN RE LIVING IT -- IN FRONT OF MULTIPLE COURTS. THEY THROUGH THE CHAIR COULD I GET A RESPONSE FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER YES YES SHOW ME MY QUESTION YES THANK YOU -- WELL BOTH OF US CAN GO BACK AND FORTH ON WAT WE'VE SEEN PROSECUTION AND DEFENSE. THERE'S BEEN NO STUDY THERE IS NO FIRM DATA THERE IS JUST OUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES BILL. SO THANK YOU AND IS SO I THINK I'M GOING. TO HI MY INTUITIVE SENSE AND SAY THIS IS I THINK A TREMENDOUS BURDEN ON SENIORS WE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN WE DO NOW ALLOWING CIVIL CASES PRIORITIZING. FOR OUR SENIOR POPULATION -- HIGH -- I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS BUT I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT BILL AND IF YOU DO AMENDED I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDRESS COLLECTED. THANK YOU THE THINGS THAT REJECTION AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR HISTORIC A SUPPORT AND THE AND COMMITMENT. TO THE ELDERLY AND SENIORS AND AND THE LEGISLATION THAT YOU CAN'T WIN FOR AND AND I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT. AS WE KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS OF CHECKS AND BALANCES WITHIN THIS LEGISLATION THE THE ALL OF THE DA'S -- HAVE TO AGREE IN AND WRITING AND IT DOES GO BEFORE A JUDGE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION THE WITNESSES ARE PROJECTED THAT THE OF VICTIMS ARE PROTECTED AND AND CERTAINLY THE THOSE ACCUSED WILL BE THAT THEIR RIGHTS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS WHICH THERE ARE SOME CHECK TO JUST. DO THE TEACHERS CAN'T DECIDE TO DO IT [inaudible] THANK YOU -- SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU I JUST -- SENATOR HILL YOUR LAST COMMENT ABOUT THE THE DEFENDANTS THAT THEIR RIGHTS WOULD BE -- PROTECTED I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE IN THE OPPOSITION LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- I BELIEVE IT WAS THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS WHO SUGGESTED THAT CAN FILED THE CONSOLIDATION OF CASES IS PRESENT IS PREJUDICIAL AGAINST THE DEFENDANT -- FELL. FELL HADN'T WHAT WHAT IS IN THE BILL THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED IN I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW A LOT A LOT OF THE DIETA TO TALK ABOUT THAT. SPECIFICALLY WITH THE RITE OF THE OF THE OF IN THE HARDSHIP OF ANYONE WITHIN THAT THAT CASE WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE JUDGE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLOT. TO SHOW IN ANY WAY THAT'S THE FOR THE DEFENDED AS WELL THE DEFENDANT AS WELL YES I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THAT THE PURPOSE OF IT IS TO LOOK AT THE THE CASE HOLISTICALLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE. THERE'S HARM TO ANYONE UHHUH UHHUH BY THE FACT OF MOVING IT TO ONE AND CONSOLIDATING WITH JURISDICTION ONE MORE QUESTION THEN THROUGH THE CHAIR WE WOULD ALLOW THE REPRESENT DIFFERENT PUBLIC DEFENDER TO RESPOND TO THAT AS WELL BUT MY NATIONAL QUESTION IS. HOW WE DECIDE WHICH? COURT OR WHICH COUNTY HAS JURISDICTION THE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT HISTORICALLY THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL DECIDE THAT WHAT COUNTY IS THAT THE WAY THAT HISTORICALLY IT WORKS. YES AND THEN IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A HEARING IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE THE DA'S OFFICE IS PROPOSING TO HOLD. THE TRIAL OR TO PROSECUTE A PARTICULAR CASE IT WOULD BE THEN DECIDED BY A MAGISTRATE IN THAT JURISDICTION AFTER HEARING ABOUT THE FACTS OF THE CASE. THE COMPLEXITY OF THE EVIDENCE FAIRNESS TO THE VICTIMS FAIRNESS TO OTHER WITNESSES AND FAIRNESS OF COURSE TO THE ACCUSED THE DEFENDANTS. AND AND ALL OF THAT WILL BE TAKING THE CONSIDERATION TO FIGURE OUT WHICH COUNTY WHICH COURT IT WOULD BE HEARD IT THAT'S CORRECT SENATOR OKAY. AND THROUGH THE CHAIR IF THE REPRESENTED FROM PUBLIC DEFENDERS CAN RESPOND TO THAT CONCERN AROUND -- PRESIDENTIAL PRESS. PREJUDICIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. OFTEN IN THESE HEARINGS I AM -- ASKING YOU NOT TO TAKE DISCRETION AWAY FROM A COURT TO HEAR THE COURT DOES HAVE DISCRETION. HOWEVER IF A GROUP OF PROSECUTORS AGREED THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE IN ONE COUNTY. I CANNOT IMAGINE A JUDGE SAYING -- IT'S TOO PREJUDICIAL AGAINST THE DEFENDANT -- AND GIVEN THAT. REALITY -- I REALLY DO HOPE THAT. THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LOOK FOR SOME TRUE DATA TRUE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS. JUDICIALLY ECONOMIC IF IT AFFECTS THE PROSECUTION IN A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE WAY THE DEFENSE FOR THE VICTIMS THE WITNESSES AND AGAIN I'M VERY VERY SYMPATHETIC. TO THE ISSUES HOWEVER -- WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN THE OTHER TYPES OF MULTI JURISDICTIONAL -- PROSECUTIONS IS. IT KIND OF COMES DOWN TO THE COUNTY WHERE MOST OFFENSES OCCURRED AND WHERE THE DEFENDANT IS YEAH SO THE CASE THAT I SPOKE OF MY CLIENT WAS IN MY COUNTY. THEREFORE I INHERITED EVERYBODY'S CASE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION FOR SHIP THANK YOU. IN ANY OTHER COMMENTS. SO WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR HILL WHICH ELECTRICAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH VENTURE I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL COLLEGE. AND THE BILL IS AS AMENDED YES THAT'S THE MOTION -- ALL RIGHT THEN WE WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL. MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER FIVE IN A FIVE MORE LOCK [inaudible] BRADFORD.

WE WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER SIX SENATOR CAFIERO. WE BELIEVE YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME WITNESSES THAT WILL BE COMING TO THE TABLE SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE OUR SPECIAL SERVICES FOLKS OUTSIDE KNOW THAT WE ARE STARTING THIS BILL SO THEY CAN ALLOW. FOR WITNESSES TO COME IN. CALLING ALL WITNESSES. THE AND THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WOULD BE GOOD IF THEY ARE IN -- YEAH AT YOUR CELL. WE NEED SOMEONE. PART SENATOR CAREER YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE SB. TWO THIRTY A BILL DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE USE OF FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS AND AND THAT WILL CHANGE THE CULTURE IN THE WORKPLACE OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST LET ME THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND PATIENCE IN WORKING WITH ALL THE PARTIES TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. SECOND WE ARE TAKING AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO AMENDMENTS ONE TO DELETE THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION SECTION ONE F.. AND TO DO THAT TO DELETE SECTION THREE OF THE BILL RELATING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE ONE NINETY SIX AND FINALLY TO ADD SECTION SIX WHICH WOULD DURING MY BILL WITH AB. THREE NINETY TWO WE JOIN WITH THE JOINT MAKING IT. JOINING IT. YES. LET ME ALSO BEGIN BY THINKING ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THAT SPOKE TO ME ABOUT SB TWO THIRTY THEY CAME TO MY OFFICE R RALLIED FOR CHANGE. WE HEARD YOU WE LISTENED AND WE RESPONDED BY MAKING AMENDMENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. QUESTION ME WHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN THE BILL THAT IS SO CONTROVERSIAL. WELL I TELL YOU I SERVICES CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND EIGHT YEARS AS MAYOR. AS A MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I TOOK VERY SERIOUSLY AND PERSONALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE PEACE SAFETY AND HARMONY AMONG ALL RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. HOW YOU DRESSED IN WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DID? THIS ISSUE OF WHEN THE USE OF FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS IS APPROPRIATE AND UNDERWENT CIRCUMSTANCES. WAS AND IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME AND IT IS AN EMOTIONAL COMPLEX AND DIVISIVE ISSUE. YET WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER AND FOCUS ON THE TRUE INTENT OF THE BILL. WHICH IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS WHERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THE NATION BY CITY SETTING A NEW STANDARD THAT ESTABLISHES THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. TO ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES FACING AMERICA TODAY. THE COUNTRY NEEDS LEADERSHIP ON THIS A ISSUE AND CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STAND TOGETHER AND LEAD THE WAY FORWARD. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE OBLIGATION TO ENACT THE CHANGES NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR OFFICERS AS THEY UPHOLD THEIR COMMITMENT TO SERVE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE ROOM TO IMPROVE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF FORCE AND CALIFORNIA'S. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE PROGRESS IF WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH MEANINGFUL CHANGE. WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER. WE ARE COMMITTED TO TO DOING JUST THAT AND TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION AND THAT CHANGES. OUR USE OF FORCE POLICIES THAT WE CAN ALL CHAMPION TOGETHER. THAT IS WHY I ALONG WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMUNITY LEADERS AND THE TWENTY ONE LEGISLATORS WHO CAUGHT THROUGH THE BILL TO DEVELOP LEGISLATION THAT INCLUDES INPUT. FROM PERSPECTIVES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE USED RESEARCH AND SURVEYS AS THE AND HAVE FOUND THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD PROVEN TO REDUCE THE USE OF FORCE. IT IT IT IS AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH THAT FOCUSES ON ADOPTING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BEST PRACTICES WITH PROVEN RESULTS. SB TWO THIRTY IS THE ONLY LEGISLATION THAT WILL PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO REDUCE THE USE OF FORCE EFFECTIVELY. AND IT WILL BUILD ON CALIFORNIA'S RIGOROUS OFFICER TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BY STABBING XING A MINIMUM STANDARD ON THE USE OF FORCE FOR ALL FIVE HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE THE STATE. CALIFORNIA WILL RAISE THE NATIONAL STANDARD TO PROTECT THE SANCTITY OF LIFE BY REQUIRING THAT THE USE OF FORCE BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE THREAT IMPOSED. ESTABLISHING THE FIRST STATEWIDE GUIDELINES TO CLEARLY DEFINE WHEN OFFICERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE FORCE REQUIRING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER RECEIVED THE MOST ROBUST TRAINING. IN THE NATION STRICTLY DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE USE OF FORCE SETTING SPECIFIC POLICY REQUIREMENTS ON DE ESCALATION INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION TRAINING TACTICAL METHODS THAT USED TIME. DISTANCE COVER AND CONCEALMENT REQUIRING IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY SETTING FOR DETAILS DETAILED STANDARDIZE REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ALL INSTANCES WHEN FORCE IS USED. SPECIFYING THAT THE USE OF FORCE POLICIES AND TRAINING ARE CONSIDERED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. AND ADDING NEW DUTIES SUCH AS THE DUTY TO RENDER MEDICAL AID THE DUTY OF OFFICERS TO INTERCEDE TO REPORT INCIDENTS OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IN THE DUTY OF SUPERVISORS TO REPORT AND INVESTIGATE INCIDENTS AS WELL. ALL OF THESE NEW GUIDELINES AND DUTIES WILL REQUIRE THAT ALL POLICE AGENCIES IN THEIR OFFICERS UNDERGO AND NEW TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM. THE STATE WILL NEED T COMMIT THROUGH POST OUR POLICE OFFICERS STANDARD TRAINING PROGRAM. UP TO UNDER TACK UNDERTAKE THIS TRAINING AND DEFINE THE CHANGE WE BELIEVE THAT SB TWO THIRTY MAKES FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE TRAINED AND THAT THIS WILL ENABLE THE CULTURE SHIFT AWAY FROM DEADLY USE OF FORCE. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. THERE IS WORK STILL TO BE DONE AND I'VE COMMITTEE YOU TO CONTINUE FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS THAT CREATE CREATE MEANINGFUL CHANGE -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS BRIAN MARVEL PRESIDENT THE PIC POLICE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA.

SPECIALIZED PEACE OFFICERS WORKING IN OUR AIRPORTS AND SCHOOLS ONE WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER STATEWIDE PUBLIC SAFETY JOBS. WE'RE DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO ON A DAILY BASIS KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

SB TWO THIRTY IS THE ONLY LEGISLATION OR PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO REDUCE THE USE OF FORCE EFFECTIVELY. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE PROGRESS. WE WANT TO ACCOMPLISH ACCOMPLISHMENT A FULL CHANGE WE CANNOT WORK IN SILOS. THE BEST PUBLIC POLICIES ARE NOT MADE IN A VACUUM. WE UST COME TOGETHER TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCES PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTISE. PORAC IS ASKING THAT SB TWO THIRTY BE PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL ALONG FORSMAN BUT I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD THEY WOULD AGREE WITH ME WHEN I SAY. WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION THAT WE CAN ALL CHAMPION TOGETHER. IN FACT AS OF YESTERDAY DOCTOR WEBER REACHED OUT TO US FOR MEETING AS EARLY AS THIS THURSDAY. OR EARLY NEXT WEEK. ON BEHALF OF POOR ACTOR WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE OUR VIEWS AND HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE REMARKS REMARKABLE WORK BEING DONE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OUR PARTNERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME'S RON LAWRENCE IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. I REPRESENT THE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO ACTIVE POLICE CHIEF FROM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE WHO ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING PUBLIC SAFETY TO MORE THAN TWENTY EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. OVER THE DECADES OF SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY BEEN CONFRONTED WITH MANY TRAGIC EVENTS AND NONE MORE SERIOUS THAN THOSE RESULTING IN THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. MUCH IS AT STAKE ON THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE BEING DEBATED HERE AT THE CAPITOL SURROUNDING USE OF FORCE. A MATTER SO SERIOUS THAT IT IS AT THE VERY CORE OF HOW WE SAFELY GO ABOUT PROTECTING VICTIMS ARE COMMUNITIES AND FORCING LAWS CREATED BY THE VERY LEGISLATOR IN VOTERS OF THIS STATE. WITH EACH SEEN THE DAMAGE DEADLY FORCE DOES TO FAMILIES NEIGHBORS FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES. ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN THROUGH SUCH AN EVENT IS FOREVER CHANGED. AS POLICE CHIEFS WE ALL KNOW WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL THE DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES OUR POLICE OFFICERS FACE WHEN MAKING SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS LIFE OR DEATH DECISIONS WHEN CONFRONTED WITH AN ASSAILANT OR AN ATTACKER. WE KNOW THE PAIN IT CAUSES US OUR DEPARTMENTS AND OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN WE LOSE A POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. FOLLOWING THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE BY ONE OF OUR OFFICERS. THE POLICE CHIEF RESPONSIBILITY TO SEEK THE TRUTH YOUR FACT BASED INVESTIGATIONS. HELPING THE PUBLIC TO FIND ANSWERS HOLDING OUR POP OUR POLICE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE AND ADDRESS THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA AND FINDING WAYS TO IMPROVE. THESE ARE THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE TAX THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS FROM ACROSS OUR STATE. HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING POLICIES AND TRAINING THAT HELPED US DEVELOP SB. TWO THIRTY MANY OF THE ROBUST POLICY REQUIREMENTS IN SB. TWO THIRTY WHICH INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS ON DE ESCALATION. RENDERING MEDICAL FIRST DATE DEALING WITH VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AN OFFICER'S DUTIES INTERCEDE WHEN OBSERVING EXCESSIVE FORCE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TRAINING AND MUCH MORE. COME FROM ADVANCED WORK BY POLICE CHIEF AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE ISSUES NOW BEING FATE RAISED IN THIS DEBATE. MANY ALSO CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL IN HIS RECOMMENDATIONS ON POLICE USE OF FORCE POLICIES. IF THE POSITIVE RESULTS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE RECENT YEARS USE OF DEADLY FORCE DROPPING NEARLY 35% FROM 200-017-22000 EIGHTEEN AND WE BELIEVE THE POLICY IN TRAINING AND SB TWO THIRTY WILL LEAD TO EVEN MORE GREATER OUTCOMES. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO PUT THESE REQUIREMENTS REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED IN SB TWO THIRTY IN PERSPECTIVE AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. ONLY ABOUT 30% OF THE NATION'S NINETY ONE LARGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE ANY DE ESCALATION REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR USE OF FORCE POLICIES. AND ONLY ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER AS REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFICERS INTERVENE TO STOP ANOTHER OFFICER FROM USING EXCESSIVE FORCE. UNDER SB TWO THIRTY EACH OF OUR OVER FIVE HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN OUR STATE WILL MEET THOSE STANDARDS AND OVER A DOZEN MORE. NO STATE IN THE NATION WILL HAVE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT MANDATING THE TYPE OF STATEWIDE COMPREHENSIVE AND ROBUST USE OF FORCE POLICIES THAT SB TWO THIRTY MANDATES. SB TWO THIRTY WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE CHANGE BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE TRAINING OF POLICIES ARE NOT THE ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION. THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION LOOKS FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE LEGISLATOR ON THIS ISSUE. AS WE HAVE DONE NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE PAST ON IMPORTANT ISSUES SUCH AS CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE. IMMIGRATION TRANSPARENCY AND MANY OTHERS AND MANY OTHER CRUCIAL PUBLIC SAFETY MATTERS BASED IN CALIFORNIA. REGARDED THE POLICY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB. TWO THIRTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KATHLEEN MUSTAD ME STORM I'M A UNION SITE LABOR LAWYER REPRESENTING PUBLIC SAFETY UNION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LAWN FORCES RECOGNITION OF THE THINK THE OF WHITE DRIVES SB. TWO THIRTY I MANY NOT THE LANGUAGE REGARDING PENAL CODE SECTION ONE NINETY SIX ENJOY NEED. TO EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. TO REACH CONSENSUS BILLS GOVERNING USE OF CHANGE SB TWO THIRTY SIX ESTABLISH A NATIONAL PRESIDENT BY SETTING CONSISTENT USE OF FORCE POLICIES AND TRAIN REQUIREMENTS. FOR ALL FIVE HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. USE THE FORCE TACTICS ARE PERISHABLE SKILLS. SB TWO THIRTY WILL HELP TO TRAIN AND ENSURE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT DE ESCALATION AND USE OF FORCE ALTERNATIVES IN POTENTIALLY DEADLY USE OF FORCE SITUATIONS. THREE IMPROVE TRAINING AND SB TWO THIRTY LIKE SCENARIO BASED TRAINING OFFICERS ABILITY TO IMMEDIATELY JUDGE AND REACT WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF FORCE WILL BE IMPROVED. ALL LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR USE OF FORCE POLICIES AND REPORTING PROCEDURES. DEPARTMENTS WILL HAVE THE DISCRETION TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES BEYOND THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEEDS OF THAT PARTICULAR AGENCIES AND COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE EVERY DEPARTMENT WILL ADOPT A POLICY REQUIRING OFFICERS CONSIDER THEIR SURROUNDINGS AND POTENTIAL RESTED BY STANDARDS BEFORE DISCHARGING A FIREARM. AND REQUIRE AN OFFICER TO INTERCEDE THEY PERCEIVE AN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. AND THAT THAT POTENTIAL EXCESSIVE FORCE BE REPORTED TO A SUPERIOR OFFICER. THIS CREATES A HIGHER RESPONSIBILITY RESULT IN HIGHER ACCOUNTABILITY. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOUND DEVELOPING OFFICERS CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ON HOW AND WHEN TO USE FORCE BEGINS WITH HIS OR HER INITIAL TRAINING. AT THE POLICE ACADEMY. SB TWO THIRTY EIGHT AND A FIVE SPECIFIC COURSES OF BASIC TRAINING WHICH INCLUDE DE ESCALATION IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS. CULTURAL COMPETENCY USE OF FORCE AND RENDERING MEDICAL AID. THEY NEED SKILLS ARE MAINTAINED AND IMPROVE IMPROVE THROUGH ANNUAL CONTINUE TRAINING. BY INCREASING STANDARDS AND TRAIN AS A SENATE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS NOTES THE QUALITY OF A REASONABLE OFFICER INCREASES AS WELL. CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING MEANINGFUL CHANGE AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS TO DO SO. PLEASE VOTE I THANK YOU DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT CAN COME TO THE MY CAN JUST INDICATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION IN YOUR SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SHANE LEVINE ON BEHALF OF THE TERM OR OF POLICE AND THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SO BEFORE WE START OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I JUST WANNA -- OUR AUTHORS OPENING SHE INDICATED SHE WOULD BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS SUGGESTED SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE -- WHO IS LISTENING IN IN HE ROOM UNDERSTANDS WHAT THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE -- AND ALL INDICATE THEM AND THEN SENATOR -- COVER YOUR IF THERE'S ANY ISSUE BETWEEN WHAT I'M. NOT CONVEYING IN YEAH IF THERE'S A CLARIFICATION PLEASE. SO -- WHAT THE -- COMEDIAS PROPOSED IN WHAT THE AUTHORS ACCEPTING IS THAT. THE SB TWO THIRTY IF APPROVED BY THE COMMITTEE AS AMENDED WOULD REMOVE THE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT RELATE TO THE STANDARD FOR JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE BY PEACE OFFICER -- IN IN FACT THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS. WOULD CONFORM THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS TO THAT REMOVAL OF THE LEGAL STANDARD. WOULD LEAVE THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO TRAINING. AND TO THE MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WOULD USE RELATED TO USE OF FORCE [inaudible] AND THERE'S ALSO A FEW CONFORMING CHANGES THESE ARE MORE TECHNICAL -- BUT EDITION ONLY WOULD ADD A PROVISION TO SB TWO THIRTY THAT MAKES SB TWO THIRTY CONTINGENT. ON SO IN OTHER WORDS BEFORE IT COULD BECOME LAW IT WOULD BE CONTINGENT. ON AB THREE NINETY TO BECOMING LAW. I'M SO IN EFFECT TO THE THE PURPOSE OF THE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE THAT -- BECAUSE SB TWO THIRTY AS PRESENTED -- ADS IN PRINT. WOULD CODIFY IN EFFECT A USE OF STORE FOR STANDARD THAT IS ALREADY IN PRACTICE DUE TO A COURT RULING. THAT THE COMMITTEE FELT THERE WAS NOT NECESSITY TO CODIFY. THAT USE OF FORCE STANDARD SINCE IT IS WHAT IS IN EFFECT NOW. IN CALIFORNIA BUT INSTEAD BECAUSE THERE IS A BILL THAT IS UP. BEING MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE NOW THAT MIGHT READ VICE USE OF FORCE STANDARD. THAT. THESE WOULD BE CONJOINED SO THAT IF THERE IS  REVISION TO THE POLICE OF USE A STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA. THEN OBVIOUSLY THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING. THAT IS SUGGESTED IN THIS BILL WOULD PROCEED AND WOULD OF COURSE BE BASED ON THAT -- SO THERE'S A A LOT OF BY. WHICH WE SAY -- IT CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT. WHICH WE'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION NOW FOR SOME TIME. AND MY HOPE AND WE'LL SEE IF TO HAVE THE COMMITTEE FEELS BUT MY HOPE AND LITTLE CLEARLY HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION. IS THAT THERE WOULD BE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS AND WE MIGHT COME TO A PLACE WHERE WE BOTH HAVE REVISED USED TO FOR STANDARD AND GOOD ASSOCIATED TRAINING. SO THAT ONE CALIFORNIA COULD MOVE FORWARD -- CENTER MITCHELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION NOT WAIT. FOR THE PERFECT TIME OKAY OPPOSITION IS FINE OKAY GREAT AND SENATOR -- ZERO DID I CLEAR DID I CONVEY THOSE APPROPRIATELY YES TO YOUR UNDERSTANDING OKAY. ALL RIGHT EXCELLENT SO THEN -- WE WILL -- HAVE OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION FANS WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ONCE WE ARE CONCLUDING AND WE'RE IN CONVERSATION OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN COME BACK TO THE TAPE. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HER. SO -- THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD COME TO THE TABLE I'M SORRY EXCUSE ME APOLOGIES. IN OPPOSITION. BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE STANDING AT THE MIKE THERE. DO WE HAVE [inaudible] THREE YEAH. DO WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY -- SPEAKERS IN [inaudible] OPPOSITION. OKAY GREAT EVEN COME TO THE TABLE AND THEN OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE ELSE CAN -- INDICATE AT THE MIKE THEY ARE ME TO USE -- AFTER WEEK INCLUDE THEIR DISCUSSION. TIME AND IF THERE IS ANY -- ANY -- CLARIFICATION THAT THE OPPOSITION NEEDS AS TO WHAT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED FOR THE MOMENT SO WHAT THE AUTHORS ACCEPTED WEEK BE HAPPY TO GO OVER THOSE AGAIN. AND PLEASE PROCEED. GIVE ME MY NAME IS THERESA SMITH -- AND I'M THE MOTHER OF CAESAR CREWS -- I'M STILL NOT SURE ABOUT THE THE AMENDMENT SO I'M JUST HERE. IN OPPOSITION TO THE TWO THIRTY MY SENSE IS OUR CRUISE. WAS SHOT FIFTEEN TIMES IN THE BACK. DECEMBER ELEVENTH. TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BY FIVE POLICE OFFICERS WELL HE WAS JUST REFERENCE THE BILL. HE WASN'T COMMITTING A CRIME HE WAS NOT. ON PROBATION OR PAROLE ANYWAYS THERE WAS JUST NO NEED TO TO SHOOT AND KILL THEM. IT'S GOING TO BE TEN YEARS THIS YEAR THAT -- TOOK MY SON'S LIFE. HE LEFT BEHIND FIVE BOYS. WE'RE NOT HAVING TO GROW UP WITHOUT A FATHER. AND HAVING HIM THERE FOR THEIR BIRTHDAY FOR CHRISTMAS. WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL? THIS IS HARD TO DO BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE TEN YEARS. THIS IS MY SON THIS IS. THE CHILD THAT I CARRIED FOR NINE MONTHS BROUGHT INTO THIS WORLD AND THEN HAD TO PUT IN THE GROUND. HANNAH NOT HAVING OFFICERS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT IS LIKE REALLY DIFFICULT. YOU KNOW MY SON WAS A FOOT LIKE I SAID A FATHER OF FIVE BOYS AND AND HE WAS JUST. OF ALL THE THINGS THAT HE DID IN LIFE THE BEST THING HE DID WAS JUST BEING SUCH A GREAT FATHER TO HIS FATHER TO HIS CHILDREN -- WEEK SAID I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO DIE IN THE MANNER IN WHICH HE DID YOU KNOW. POLICE OFFICER SHOULD BE SHOOTING PEOPLE FOR NOT AN IMMINENT DANGER. THE CALIFORNIA LAW IT'S POLICE OFFICERS USE DEADLY FORCE AND KILL SOMEONE EVEN WHEN OFFICERS HAVE OTHER OPTIONS. THAT MEANS WELL MANY POLICE SHOOTINGS LIKE THE ONE THAT TOOK MY SON'S LIFE ARE LEGALLY JUSTIFIED. THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN NECESSARY. SO LET THAT SINK IN. POLICE CAN SHOOT AND TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE. TO KNOWING THIS DEPENDS MY PAIN BUT IS ALSO STRENGTHENED MY RESOLVE. TO HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO ADVOCATE FOR REFORMS THAT WILL HELP PREVENT MORE UNNECESSARY TRAGEDIES. AND UNFORTUNATELY SB. TWO THIRTY AS FAR AS THAT I'M CLOSING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I HAVEN'T I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS. IT DOESN'T CHANGES BY THE KEEPING THE REASONABLE STANDARD INTACT SB TWO THIRTY WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW OFFICERS TO KILL PEOPLE LIKE CAESAR. EVEN WHEN THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE THREAT. AND EVEN WHEN OFFICERS HAVE OTHER ALTERNATIVES. HUMAN LIFE HUMAN LIFE IS A VERY PRECIOUS THING. THAT MUST BE PRESERVED AND PROTECTED. ESPECIALLY BY PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO SERVE AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THAT SHOULDN'T BE UP FOR DEBATE AND WE CAN'T PUT OFF ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM ANY LONGER. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK TO SAVE LVES. AND KEEP BOTH THE PUBLIC AND POLICE OFFICERS SAVE. UPDATING CALIFORNIA'S USE OF FOR STANDARD FROM THE REASONABLE STANDARD TO THE NECESSARY NECESSITY STANDARD IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION. BUT A GLARING OMISSION AND SB. TWO THIRTY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT OFFICERS AT AGENCIES WITH STRICTER USE OF POLICE -- POLICY FORCED USE OF FORCE POLICIES KILL FEWER PEOPLE AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED THEMSELVES. MY SON SHOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. UNFORTUNATELY NOTHING ANYONE. DOES WILL BRING HIM BACK. BUT I'M NOT GOING TO STOP FIGHTING FOR THIS. UNTIL PEOPLE ARE USE THE UNTIL THEY STOP KILLING PEOPLE. WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN IMMINENT DANGER OR UNTIL I TAKE MY LAST BREATH? YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTS AND YOU KNOW THEY DO A LOT OF RESEARCH. BUT A LOT OF THIS TOPIC GOES ON REALLY DON'T TALK TO IMPACT OF FAMILY MEMBERS YOU KNOW ON WE BECOME THE EXPERTS. SO YOU GUYS REALLY SHOULD. PROBABLY MEET WITH IMPACTED FAMILIES AND NOT JUST WITH YOUR EXPERTS ON DATA. YOU KNOW ON MY SON IS NOT DATA MY SON WAS A HUMAN BEING. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DOMINIC ARTICLE IS A ACID BEFORE YOU IN THREE CAPACITIES. FIRST TIME THE MOTHER NATHANIEL NATE HERIS PICK IT THE SECOND MY ONLY CHILD WAS GUNNED DOWN ON NOVEMBER NINETEENTH.

STATED THAT HE WAS MAKING A CONSENSUAL STOP SOMETIMES DURING HIS DEPOSITION HE ALSO USE THE TERM COMMUNITY POLICING. AGAIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS FRESH OUT OF THE CURRENT TRAINING. EITHER TURN CONVEY THE MY SON WOULD HAVE TO HAVE AGREED WITH THE STOP OTHERWISE HE WAS AUTHORIZED TO WALK AWAY. AT THE END OF SAID CONSENSUAL STOP THIS COMMUNITY POLICING MY SON LAY DEAD FROM TWO BULLET WOUNDS AT CLOSE RANGE. W. WOULD USE THE PHRASE I FEARED FOR MY LIFE HE SAID THAT MY SON LOOKED AT HIM SEVERAL TIMES WHILE CROSSING. THE STREET IN THE CROSSWALK WITH THE LIGHT. THAT HE JUMPED THE FENCE THAT HE MADE WAS UNCOOPERATIVE RESISTING AND THAT HE STRUCK HIM REPEATEDLY AND THEREFORE HE HAD TO USE DEADLY FORCE. DEBBIE WAS WAS NEVER PLACED ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE HE WAS NOT INTERVIEWED FOR MONTHS AFTER THE SHOOTING AT APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR LATER HE SHOT ANOTHER ON OUR CITIZEN A LATINO MALE SIX TIMES. NOT UNLESS YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAVE MY FACTS ALL WRONG ABOUT THIS CASE BUT I AM JUST A GRIEVING MOTHER TALKING NONSENSE PLEASE KNOW THAT THERE WERE SIXTEEN WORKING CAMERAS AT MY SON'S RESIDENTS THAT COUGH THIS MURDER FROM ALL ANGLES. THERE WERE AYE WITNESSES THERE HAS BEEN A CIVIL TRIAL WHICH THE COUNTY'S EXPERT TOLD THE TRUTH AND CONSEQUENTLY WHAT OUR BEST EVIDENCE. PROVING OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THE DEPUTY LIFE WAS NOT ENDANGERED AND WAS IN FACT THE AGGRESSOR BEATING MY SON WHO AGAIN ACCORDING TO COUNTY EXPERTS. WERE VIEW WHO VIEW THE VIDEO SLIDE BY SLIDE NEVER JUMPED THE FENCE AND NEVER STRUCK THE OFFICER ONE TIME. THE RESULT OF THE CIVIL TRIAL WAS. AN AWARD IN THE AMOUNT OF THIRTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT SEEN. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT BASED ON THE EGREGIOUS NATURE OF THIS CASE THAT A JURY COMPOSED OF MANY PEOPLE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE. DETERMINE THAT THIS WAS AN EGREGIOUS ACT. AND THEY STATED THAT WITH THE JUDGMENT. BUT THERE WAS NEVER A DISCUSSION NOT EVEN A DISCUSSION OF AN INDICTMENT OR CONSEQUENCE FOR THE DEPUTIES WERE REASONABLE ACTION. IN MY SECOND CAPACITY I SIT HERE BEFORE HE WAS A RETIRED ARMY COLONEL A TWO TIME COMBAT VETTING YES I WAS STATIONED AT THE PENTAGON ON THE DAY THAT IT WAS HERE. I UNDERSTAND WILL FEARING FOR YOUR LIFE MEANS. AND HAVING TO MAKE A DECISION UNDER DURESS I HAVE STATED BEFORE REITERATE THAT THE MILITARY HAS MORE STRINGENT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. AGAINST THE KNOWN ENEMY THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA. PRISONERS OF WAR GOVERNMENT AYE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS THE STATE THAT THEY MUST BE TREATED HUMANELY. IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE PROTECTED AGAINST ANY ACT OF VIOLENCE AS WELL AS INTIMIDATION AND FURTHERMORE THEY ARE PROTECTED AGAINST MURDER. TORTURE AS WELL AS CRUEL HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING TREATMENT. THERE APPEARS TO BE A DIRECT CORRELATION OF THE MILITARIZATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE TOWARD OUR COMMUNITY. HOWEVER DOES NOT RESULT IN APPROPRIATE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT ARE HONORING CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF BLACK BROWN AND NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. FINALLY I'M HERE IS AN EDUCATED VOTER WHO HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO READ SB TWO THIRTY AND DO MY RESEARCH ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DEADLY FORCE. SB TWO THIRTY IS A BILL BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HOLDING THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. THIS IS THIS EXTRA THE STATISTICS SHOW THAT BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA POLICE HE ONE THOUSAND SEVENTY ONE PEOPLE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF ANY STATE OF THE TEN HIGHEST RATE WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR POPULATION. FIVE ONE ELEVEN GUN HOMICIDES ARE COMMITTED BY POLICE. IN THIS STATE. TO COUNT THEM TWO SHOOTINGS RESULTED IN CHARGES BUT NOT ONE CONVICTION ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY ZERO JUSTICE AND THIS IS NOT CHANGED BY A. B. EXCUSE ME SB TWO THIRDS. AND ABOVE ALL IT BEARS REPEATING OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NOT WAR ZONES IN OUR FAMILIES ARE NOT IN ANY COMBATANTS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUE TO TREAT US LIKE THIS. NOT WITH A GUARDIAN MINDSET OF SERVING AND PROTECTING WORSE THE BAR FOR WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN USE DEADLY FORCE AT HOME IS LOWER THAN THE BAR FROM THE MILITARY CAN USE DEADLY FORCE BROUGHT. THIS BILL IS TOO LITTLE TOO LATE. THIS IS THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE TIME. THIS BILL DOES NOT PROTECT OR BENEFIT ANYONE EXCEPT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 1%. WHO WITH THE MANDATE OF PROTECTING AND SERVING? ARE ONLY PROTECTING IS SERVING THEIR OWN INTEREST SO I SIT HERE BEFORE YOU RESPECTFULLY URGING A NO VOTE ON SB TWO THIRTY AND A YES ON THREE NINETY TWO NEXT TO IT. A GOOD MORNING -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS A HELLO CHEN I'M A PROFESSOR OF LAW AT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL I TEACH CRIMINAL LAW. AND I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION FOR THELOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I'M HERE ON MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION -- I DO HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION IS IT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING FROM FROM THE CONVERSATION EARLIER THAT -- ANY AMENDMENTS TO A PENAL CODE ONE NINETY SIX THAT WERE CONTAINED IN SB TO THIRTY ARE BEING. DISTRICT OKAY SO LET ME CLEAR LET ME MAKE SURE. YES. AND AND THOSE ARE. TO CLARIFY PENAL CODE ONE NINETY SIX IS THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD YES SO. THEY ARE BEING STRIPPED FROM THIS BILL SINCE THIS BILL PROPOSES ONLY TO CODIFY THAT WHICH IS ALREADY IN PRACTICE. SO. THAT'S WHAT THE K. HOW THE COMMITTEE WITH A RECEIPT RIGHT -- SO MOST OF MY COMMENTS I PREPARED WERE RELATED TO THOSE PROVISIONS SO I'M GOING TO SHIFT AND TALK A BIT MORE BROADLY ABOUT. THE NEED FOR SIGNIFICANT REFORM TO POLICE USE OF FORCE STANDARDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF DEADLY POLICE SHOOTINGS IN THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN CAP BY CALIFORNIA POLICE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THAT WAS UP FROM ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED WERE NOT ARMED. AND THREE FORCE FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR -- PARTICULARLY OTHERS SIGNIFICANT INCREASING VULNERABILITY TO POLICE VIOLENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE DISABILITIES PARTICULARLY PEOPLE OF COLOR SO I THINK THAT THAT'S RELEVANT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE CONVERSATION RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS BILL. PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE POINT TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE KILLED NOT BY LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS IN LA COUNTY WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES. OF A USE OF FORCE. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE MOST ANTIQUATED STANDARDS OF OF POLICE USE OF FORCE IT WAS ENACTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND IT'S BEEN CALLED THE SINGLE OLDEST UNAMENDED LAW ENFORCEMENT USE OF FOUR STATUTE IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S IN CONSISTENT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARDS ADOPTED BY THE SUPREME COURT RELATED TO GENERAL USE OF FORCE AND IT AS IT RELATES TO USE OF FORCE AGAINST WILL QUOTE UNQUOTE FLEEING FELONS. I TEACH CRIMINAL LAW ONE OF THE BASIC TENANTS OF SELF DEFENSE LAW IS THAT THE USE OF FORCE MUST BE IMMINENT. THAT IT MUST BE NECESSARY AND THAT THE USE OF FORCE MUST BE PROPORTIONAL NONE OF THOSE ARE PRESENT IN CURRENT LAW AND THEY SHOULD BE CIVILIANS ARE HELD TO THE STANDARD POLICE SHOULD BE HELD TO THE STANDARD. THE CHANGES IN THESE POLICIES PARTICULARLY A PROPOSED BY AB THREE NINETY TWO WILL SAVE LIVES. ONE STUDY FOUND THAT AMONG LARGE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN NEARLY SO FOR STANDARD HAD RESULT IN FEWER I USE OF FORCE -- USE OF USES OF FORCE AND FEWER POLICE SHOOTINGS. IN SOME IT ACTUALLY INCREASES POLICE OF SAFETY AND INCREASES PUBLIC SAFETY. CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD FOLLOW SUIT AND WE SHOULD ADOPT STANDARDS THAT ARE MANDATORY AND THAT AT THAT EXIST ACROSS THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE PRIOR VERSION OF SB -- TO THIRTY THESE WERE SORT OF THEY WERE GENERAL MINIMUM STANDARDS BUT THEY COULD VERY ACROSS THE STATE. ONCE HONOR ABILITY TO POLICE VIOLENCE SHOULDN'T DEPEND ON WHAT ZIP CODE YOU LIVE IN RIGHT WE SHOULD ALL HAVE UNIFORM STANDARDS THAT PROTECT US AGAINST UNNECESSARY POLICE USE OF FORCE PARTICULARLY WHEN THE OFFICERS ARE ESCALATING. THE VIOLENCE AND THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF AB THREE NINETY TWO WHICH IS NOW BEEN JOINED WITH SB. TWO THIRTY WE SHOULD DEMAND THAT IN ORDER FOR THE STATE OR AGENTS TO TAKE A LIFE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO REASONABLE ALTERNATIVE THEN TO USE DEADLY FORCE. RIGHT THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT POLICE HAVE TO USE ANY AND ALL UNDER REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THEY HAVE. TO THANKS FOR ALL REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES TO THE USE OF FORCE IF WE SAY THAT WE HAVE A REVERENCE FOR LIFE THEN WE HAVE TO MEAN IT WE CAN'T TAKE LIFE AND WE CANNOT ALL THREE TO STOP THE REST OF STATE TO TAKE LIFE. WHEN IT IS UNNECESSARY? I DON'T WANNA CLOSE WITH WITH THIS CALIFORNIA CO QUARTS OF REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED THAT ANY CIVILIZED SYSTEM OF LAW RECOGNIZES THE SUPREME VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE. ANY EXCUSES OR JUSTIFIES TAKING ONLY IN CASES OF APPARENT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY IT IS TIME THAT WE HAD TO USE A FOR STANDARDS RELATED TO THE POLICE THAT EXEMPLIFY THESE VALUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

THAT POLICE VIOLENCE IS A PLAGUE THAT LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS A PLAGUE. AND SB TWO THIRTY IS A PLAY THAT'S WHY I'M STANDING OUT AGAINST SB TWO THIRTY AND IN FAVOR OF AB THREE NINE TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND BEFORE WE HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION WHICH OF COURSE WE ALLOW EVERYONE -- TO BUT I JUST WANTED TO ALERT EVERYONE I'M SURE MANY OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE OUT SO I DIDN'T NECESSARILY HERE. THAT THE AUTHOR IS ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE IS SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDING THE BILL WE ARE GETTING COPIES OF THE MOCK UP OF WHAT THE BILL WOULD LOOK LIKE AS AMENDED. AND WE'VE ALREADY DISTRIBUTED A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM WE ARE GETTING MORE SO THEY CAN BE DISTRIBUTED SO FOLKS CAN. SEE ON THAT THE BILL IF THIS COMMITTEE MOVES ON IT -- WILL BE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED -- AND THEN WHAT -- WHAT? I WOULD LIKE IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO REMAIN AND I DO APPRECIATE HOW MUCH YOU'VE TRAVELED. AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS AND ALSO. THE TRAGEDIES ANY OF YOU MAY HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED OR YOUR FAMILIES. BUT WHAT I WOULD HOPE -- BECAUSE WE NEED -- TO WE WILL HAVE TO CLOSE THIS COMMITTEE DOWN AT NEW NOT FOR GOOD BUT WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS AT NOON THAT MEMBERS HAVE TO ATTEND. TO SO WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT WE CAN CONCLUDE OUR DELIBERATIONS ON THIS BILL BY NOON. AND SO IF -- IF YOU CAN HELP ME AND JUST INDICATE YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION IN YOUR OPPOSITION FROM THIS POINT ON IT WOULD BE VERY APPRECIATED -- AND LATER I CAN REPEAT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS REMOVE THE PORTIONS OF THE BILL THAT REFER TO THE USE OF FORCE. THE ONLY AT THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ONLY RETAIN THOSE PORTIONS OF-THE BILL THAT DEAL WITH -- TRAINING AND ALSO DEAL WITH A COUPLE OF THE LOCAL STANDARDS THE AMENDMENTS WOULD RETAIN THE SECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE OFFICERS TO PROMPTLY PROVIDE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND WOULD ALSO RETAIN THE REQUIREMENT THAT OFFICERS HAVE TO INTERCEDE THEY SEE -- INAPPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE AND REPORT IF THEY SEE ANOTHER OFFICER IN INAPPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE BUT THE OTHER MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT I THINK TO SOME OF YOU WHO OPPOSE. IS THAT THE BILLS -- BECOMING LAW IS CONTINGENT ON THE PASSAGE OF AB THREE NINETY TWO SO THAT IS. THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE -- ACCEPTING IN THE AUTHOR IS ACCEPTED SO IF THIS COMMITTEE ACTS ON THE BILL THAT'S WHAT THE BILL WOULD. WOULD -- BE AND COPIES OF THE MARKUP WILL BE DISTRIBUTED OKAY SO NOW YOU MAY PROCEED.

THAT MY GRANDSON DIDN'T HAVE A KNIFE A GUN UP PENCIL OR ANYTHING WHY DID HE KILL ON JEAN. STILL GETTING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS [inaudible] HOLIDAYS WHATEVER. SB LIVE IN HIS LIFE. THANK YOU. I OPPOSE THE BILL [inaudible] RIGHT YEAH. ALL RIGHT -- WE WILL NOW BRING THIS BACK -- TO COMMITTEE DISCUSSION AND I REALIZE THAT -- IN OUR DESCRIPTION THAT WE YOU KNOW I SHOULD USE REGULAR LANGUAGE I'M NOT A LAWYER SO I REALIZE WHEN WE NOT THAT THE WORD CONTINGENT REQUIRES LEGAL BACKGROUND UNDERSTAND BUT EVEN I DON'T ALWAYS. KNOW WHEN I USE THE WORD CONTINUE WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS SO. ALLOW ME TO REPEAT ONCE AGAIN -- RATHER TO CLARIFY -- WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED AND WHAT THE AUTHORS AGREED? THAT. SB TWO THIRTY IF THE COMMITTEE ADOPTS IT MOVING FORWARD. WOULD NOT CONTAIN. THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PUT INTO LAW. THE USE OF FORCE STANDARDS AS IT IS CURRENTLY IN HI UTILIZED IN CALIFORNIA NOW SO THE BILL WOULD NOT -- MAKE THAT PART LAW AND LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY FOR REVISIONS TO THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD -- WHICH AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BY BOTH SIDES -- IS CURRENTLY BEING -- PROMULGATED THROUGH OUR IS CURRENTLY IN. MS WEBBER'S BILL AB -- THREE NINETY TWO THE THE TWO THIRTY SO WOULD REMOVE. ANY LANGUAGE REGARDING USE OF FORCE WOULD RETAIN THE LANGUAGE REGARDING TRAINING. BUT FOR TWO THIRTY TO GO INTO LAW. THERE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE AB THIRD NINETY TWO WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO LAW. SO IN OTHER WORDS THE TRAINING WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON A NEW USE OF FORCE STANDARD. SO AB SB TWO THIRTY DOES NOT MOVE IF WE APPROVE IT AS AMENDED IT DOES NOT. BECOME LAW UNLESS THERE'S ALSO. A BILL THREE NINETY TWO THAT REVISED IS CALIFORNIA'S USE OF FORCE. I HOPE THAT I EXPLAINED THAT. ADEQUATELY -- CERTAINLY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY SPEAK ABOUT IT. I HAD [inaudible] CONSIDERED. JUST ASKING THE AUTHOR TO PUT THE NEW LANGUAGE IN THE NEW BILL NUMBER TO HELP REMOVE THE CONFUSION THAT OBVIOUSLY IS STILL AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHOR -- BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO CREATE CONFUSION THROUGH THE THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS. OF WHAT WE ARE WILL WHAT AT LEAST -- I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR THE AUTHOR BUT AT LEAST WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS. CREATE A THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE DIFFERENT SIDES TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND. THE CHANGES. TO THEIR USE OF FOR STANDARD IN CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE I THINK WE CLEARLY. HAVE AS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT MANY MANY MANY. PEOPLE UP AND DOWN THE STATE AN EXPERT TO FEEL THAT CALIFORNIA'S USE OF STAND USE OF FORCE STANDARD SHOULD BE REVISED. AND SO THE WAY THIS BILL AS AMENDED AT LEAST CREATES THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE AND TO SEE IF. I MISSED WEBER SPELL CAN MOVE FORWARD -- AND I'LL LEAVE MY COMMENTS TO THAT FOR THE MOMENT AND LET ME SEE -- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR MORE LACK. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SENATOR COVER EURO -- IN IN JULY OF TWENTY ELEVEN WE HAD AN INCIDENT ORANGE COUNTY. WE'RE A HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL -- WAS ENCOUNTERED BY THE FORTUNE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND THEY NOT NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT HE WAS MENTALLY ILL SCHIZOPHRENIC DAY. DECIDED THAT PERHAPS THEY WOULD TEACH HIM A LESSON. AND SO THEY PUMMELED HIM. AND HE WAS -- YELLING FOR HIS DAD. DAD WAS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER AND WAS CAUGHT ON VIDEO. YOUR TRAIN STATION. FOR TEN SO THOSE POLICE OFFICERS -- HAD TO GO ON TRIAL FOR MURDER. AND OUR OUR OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY ACTUALLY TRIED THE CASE HIMSELF BUT THE THE JURY RULED THAT HE WAS INNOCENT THEY WERE INNOCENT. THEY WERE NOT. THEY WERE NOT CONVICTED OF OF HAVING THE TAKING KELLY THOMAS BUT KELLY THOMAS'S CERTAINLY CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING. THAT -- SEMI WOMAN WEBER TRYING TO DO SOMETHING -- SO I JUST -- WANTED TO AFFIRM THAT WE'VE GOT TO START LOOKING AT HOWARD. HOWARD DEALING. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK. THANK YOU MANAGER. CENTER BRADFORD -- CENTER MITCHELL POLICIES YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN ON THE WHOLE TIME YEAH I JUST HAVE NO YEAH. BUT IT'D BEEN ON EVEN WHEN I ASKED PREVIOUSLY AND YEAH. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- LET ME START BY SAYING THAT WE FROM AT LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE REMEMBER. BEING IN THIS COMMITTEE A YEAR AGO -- WE'VE WE'VE COME A LONG WAY. IN THE DISCUSSION TO HEAR -- HE REPRESENTATIVE -- FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT -- A KNOWLEDGE. THAT THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WAS. SIGNIFICANT. AND I HEARD YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT. ON THOSE THEIR LEADERSHIP THAT WAS REPRESENTED HERE TODAY. I AM A CO AUTHOR OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO BOB I APPRECIATE -- THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS BILL. BUT MISS CABALLERO YOU HAVE A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM. AND THE PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM IS WE WHO WORK IN THIS FEAR EVERY DAY UNDERSTAND THE RHYTHM AND THE PACE IN THIS IS THE DEADLINE HEARING. AND WE APPRECIATE YOU WERE PROBABLY NEGOTIATED INTO LATE LAST NIGHT. ON AMENDMENTS BUT THERE IS A HOPE FORGET NUYS THE EFFORT AROUND THIS ISSUE THE POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLEARLY WE DIDN'T FACTOR THAT IN. TO GIVE PEOPLE THE RESPECT THEY ARE DUE TO SEE LANGUAGE IN PRINT TO UNDERSTAND THE DRASTIC. CHANGE -- THAT YOU ARE PUTTING FORWARD IN THIS BILL AND SO WE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY WE OPPOSE THE BILL AS IMPRINT. WHICH IS THE APRIL ELEVENTH VERSION OF THE B. L. -- WE WERE GIVEN. AMENDMENTS TODAY THAT WILL DRASTICALLY CHANGE THE CONTENT OF THE BILL AND SO YOUR PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM IS THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY OTHER THAN THOSE WHO CLEARLY WERE INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATING THE BILL. TO SEE LANGUAGE IMPRINT. YOU KNOW QUITE FRANKLY WE HAVE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE THAT THAT WE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO BEFORE WE CAN VOTE ON BILLS ON THE FLOOR. THAT BILLS ARE IN PRINT AND SO WE CAN SEE IT READ AND DIGEST IT AND SO THAT'S THE PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM WE HAVE SPENT OVER AN HOUR HEARING TESTIMONY -- HEARTFELT TESTIMONY THE PEOPLE PREPARED AND TRAVELED APPEAR. WHO WOULD KNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THEY EXPERIENCED TRAUMA EVERY TIME THEY HAVE TO TELL THE STORIES AND SAY THE NAME OF THEIR LOVED ONES AND WE GET IT? AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY ARE CLEAR ABOUTTHE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. FOR NO FAULT OF-THEIR OWN SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- MADAM CHAIR I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE IN A POSITION -- TO AND WHEN I SAY MARK UP YOU KNOW I'M OLD SCHOOL BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. BACK I AND I WAS STAFF HERE BEFORE WE HAD COMPUTERS A WE DID MOCK UP WE WOULD MOP UP. A. B. L.. YOU KNOW. EVEN NORMAL SCHOOL IN AND STAFF. FORMER STAFF I TOO AM TRYING TO LOOK AT BLAKE WAS AS I TELL SIZE IS NO LONGER ITALICIZED. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN SEE. AND DIGESTED UNDERSTAND THE BILL THAT'S TRULY BEFORE US TODAY THE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ACTION ON I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A MATTER OF WE HOLD THE VOTE UNTIL THE END OF COMMITTEE. THEREBY ALLOWING PEOPLE TIME AND PEOPLE TO TALK AND PEOPLE TO DIGEST. AND PEOPLE TO BREAK OUT IN GROUPS THAT HAVE PEOPLE EXPLAIN WHAT'S IN THE BILL I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO IT. THOSE ARE ALL SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE A PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM THIS COPY HERE IN TERMS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING. THE TRUE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY LET ME SAY THAT. LET ME SAY THAT ON TO THE OPPOSITION TO THE CHAIR. THAT I DISAGREE ON ONE POINT. WHEN PEOPLE SAY? NO TO TRAINING I DISAGREE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A CULTURE SHIFT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO WHY SUPPORT ACCOUNTABILITY I SAID I'M A CO AUTHOR BABY. THREE NINETY TWO WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CHANGE. THE AMENDED LANGUAGE AND I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF THING. NOT ONLY TALKS ABOUT. DE ESCALATION STRATEGIES. BUT SOME IMPORTANT WORDS THAT WE ARE USING QUITE LIBERALLY THROUGHOUT THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. AROUND IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BY. IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT'S NECESSARY BECAUSE WE DO SEE A DIFFERENCE IN THE TREATMENT OF SORT OF CERTAIN. RESIDENTS OF THE STATE BASEBALL COMPLEXION. SO IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING I BELIEVE IS FUNDAMENTAL AND IMPORTANT. AND I WILL NEVER NOT SUPPORT TRAINING [inaudible] THOSE WHO. BY COLOR OF AUTHORITY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT ANSWER. SB THIRTY THREE NINETY TWO DOESN'T HAVE A TRAINING COMPONENT. IT HAS THE ACCOUNTABILITY PLEASE AS IT IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT. AND SOLD TO LOOK AT THESE TWO BILLS TOGETHER. IS A POWERFUL POWERFUL COMBINATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THREE NINETY TWO EXCUSE ME SB. TWO THIRTY BASED ON THE LANGUAGE THAT I'M READING HERE. IN A MINUTE LANGUAGE SAYS. SECTION SIX AND I WILL READ. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL SHALL NOT BECOME LAW ABSENT THE SIGNING OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO THE WEATHER IS CONTINGENT CALL JOINT WHATEVER. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL SHALL NOT BECOME LAW. ABSENT THE SIGNING OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO ONE COULD ASK IF THE PROPONENTS NOW THIS BE TWO THIRTY ARE NOW GOING TO BECOME PROPONENTS OF AB. THREE NINETY TWO I DON'T KNOW I'LL ASK THEM THAT UESTION WHEN AB THREE NINETY TWO COMES BEFORE US IN THIS COMMITTEE IT'S NOT HERE TODAY. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF US. AND IT IS NOT WHAT YOU READ IN THE APRIL ELEVENTH VERSION OF THE BILL. IT'S STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT. I SEE THE CHAIR HAVING THE SIDE BAR WITH THAT OUT -- I THINK IT'S FAIR THAT THAT THE OPPOSITION GIVEN THE A MOTION OF THIS BILL. GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS IS A PUBLIC POLICY DISCUSSION WE'VE NOW BEEN ENGAGED IN. WELL OVER A YEAR GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZING THAT'S TAKEN PLACE WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A THIS IS NOT. OUR AVERAGE BILL WHERE. HEY THAT THE KIDS. AND US NEGOTIATE COME UP WITH LANGUAGE AND WE SPEAK KIND OF AN ABBREVIATED TERMINOLOGY THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH THIS ISSUE IT'S TOO PERSONAL IS TO DATE. AND SO IF MINIMALLY MADAM CHAIR. YEAH COPIES OF THE MEMBERS CAN BE DISTRIBUTED AND PEOPLE BE GIVEN TIME TO READ AND DIGEST AND THEN THE VOTE TAKEN LATER THAT WOULD BE MY REQUEST ABSENT THAT. I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON THE BILL. MISTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU AND FIRST LET ME THANK ALL THE WITNESSES WHO'VE COME BEFORE IS TO DATE. TO LEND THEIR VOICES ON WHAT IS A VERY EMOTIONAL AND PERSONAL ISSUE -- AS IT RELATES. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND I WON'T HAVE NOTHING BUT THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. AND I THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH EACH YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE. TO AMEND THE BILL AND BRING IT FORTH THAT. IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT. I CAN VOTE. FOR BUT THE REAL ISSUE THAT. WE SHOULD TAKE AWAY FROM HERE TODAY. IS NOT THE NEED OF TRAINING PER SE. IT'S THE CHANGING OF ONE'S HEART EMPIRE'S. IF WE HAD NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM HERE TODAY. WE SHOULD WALK AWAY WITH UNDERSTANDING. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE BEDROCK. OF WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS AND IT'S THE BEDROCK IS RACISM. THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS WHO'VE COME HERE BEFORE US TODAY ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. IF IT WAS ABOUT TRAINING YOU SEE THE SAME NUMBER A WHITE FAMILIES HERE TODAY TALKING ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES BEING LOS BUT THEY'RE NOT HERE WE APPRECIATE THE ONE TO COME AND SUPPORT. BUT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WOULD COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND CONTINUE TO COME AND SPEAK OUT. AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. THE ORIGIN OF THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE WAS IMPLEMENTED IN. EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO IT WAS A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE MANTA PATIENT PROCLAMATION. LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDED A NOTHER TOOL AFTER BLACK FOLKS WERE FREED IN THIS COUNTRY TO SUPPRESS AND CONTROL THERE WAS NO NEED FOR USE OF DEADLY FORCE PART. TWO THE ENDING OF SLAVERY SO WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE ORIGIN AND THE BEDROCK ALL WHITE THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE WAS EVER IMPLEMENTED IN THE STATE AND IN THIS NATION IT WAS NOT ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. AND UNTIL WE START EDUCATING PEOPLE ON WHO THIS COUNTRY IS. AND WHAT WE WERE FOUND IN ON TELL THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT RACISM AND IMPLICIT BIAS IS STILL EXISTS TODAY. I DON'T FAULT LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IT'S INGRAINED IN OUR NATION. BUT AT THE SAME TIME BASED ON THE F. B. I. REPORT THE HIGHEST. NUMBER OF RECRUITMENT AND EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS A WHITE SUPREMACIST. ARE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT'S IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT'S REALITY THAT'S FBI REPORT THAT PROVIDES THAT DATA. AND WE NEED TO ACCEPT IT AND START TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THAT'S TO CORPS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS ROW RIGHT NOW. WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH A RACIST SOCIETY AND WE WANT TO HIDE BEHIND ALL THESE OTHER. WALLS ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE DATA. SPEAKS CLEARLY TO IT AND IF I COULD QUOTE A GREAT URBAN PHILOSOPHER. JZ MEN LIE. WOMEN LIE BUT NUMBERS DON'T THE NUMBERS DO NOT LIE THIS IS STRAIGHT ABOUT RACE. AND ALL THE TRAINING IN THE WORLD. UNLESS YOU CHANGE YOUR HEART IN YOUR MIND WILL NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON HOW ARE POLICING HAPPENS IN THIS COUNTRY SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND I WANT. TO GIVE ME ALLERGIES. OUR FIRST I WANT TO THANK -- ALL OF THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE CAME OUT -- IN THE MEMORY OF OF THEIR LOVED ONES. I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD AND PEOPLE TRAVEL TO YOUR A LONG WAY -- TO TO MAKE THAT -- TESTIMONY AND THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST PROCESS EVERYTHING IS VERY FAST -- AND YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF BOILING DOWN -- THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE TWO YOU KNOW A FEW SECONDS OR A FEW MINUTES I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD EVER DO THAT -- SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO DID THAT. ON MY SUPPORT AB THREE NINETY TWO AND I LOOK FORWARD. TO KNOCK ON WOOD -- VOTING FOR IT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS COMMITTEE JUST LIKE I VOTED FOR A. B. -- NINE THIRTY ONE LAST YEAR -- I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT. DIRECTION. AND I WANNA THANK -- THE CHAIR CENTER SKINNER AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO WERE INVOLVED FOR WORKING -- TO HARMONIZE THESE BILLS AND JUST TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR AFTER THESE AMENDMENTS WHAT WE WILL HAVE IS THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD. STANDARD FOR USE OF DEADLY FORCE WILL BE AN EIGHTY THREE NINETY TWO AND THEN THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE AN SP TWO THIRTY PERIOD. ALL OF THE USE OF FORCE LANGUAGE IS BEING STRIPPED OUT OF SB THREE THIRTY SO THOSE ARE THE TWO APPROACHES AND THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO ONE ANOTHER SETTING THE USE OF FORCE STANNIS MAYBE. THREE NINETY TWO AND THEN REQUIRING TRAINING -- AND THE OUR PROCESS IS IN PERFECT SOMETIMES -- IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE BEING TAKEN IN COMMITTEE AND SO IT HASN'T BEEN -- IMPRINT BEFORE -- BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS WILL DO. NOW AND AGAIN I DO LOOK FORWARD TO AB THREE NINETY TWO ARE COMING TO THIS COMMITTEE AND VOTING FOR AND I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR WORKING -- WITH THE AND THANK THE AUTHOR OF FOR WORKING AND EVERYONE WORKING TOGETHER -- TO REMOVE THE USE OF FORCE LANGUAGE FROM SB TWO THIRTY AND TO MAKE INTO TRAINING BILL -- AND I DO AGREE WITH US CENTER MITCHELL TRAINING IS IMPORTANT IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING WE NEED TRAINING BY ITSELF DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. OF THE TRAINING IS A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. IN SOLVING. THE PROBLEM THANK YOU. THE OTHER COMICS OKAY I'M. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY. MY COLLEAGUES AND HOPE NO ONE'S DEPARTING YET -- BECAUSE WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS -- BEFORE US -- THE FIRST IN THE OPENING AND PERHAPS NOT -- WITH ENOUGH CLARITY. WHAT WE ARE DOING TODAY OR WHAT WE ARE ENTERTAINING TO DO TODAY IS. I APPRECIATE CAN BE. ON DIFFICULT -- TO TO EXCEPT BECAUSE MANY FOLKS AND LEGITIMATELY HAVE BEEN ORGANIZING AGAINST THE BILL AS IT IS IN PRINT. BECAUSE OF THE FEELINGS THAT. IN FACT BY JUST PUTTING INTO LAW. THE WHAT MANY PEOPLE FEEL IS A VERY ANTIQUATED IN ADEQUATE AND I'M JUST USE OF FORCE STANDARD. THAT IF SB TWO THIRTY WERE TO PROCEED AS IT WAS WRITTEN THAT IT WOULD JUST BE ALLOWING THE POLICE TO CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS AS USUAL. AND I WHAT I'D LIKE TO CONVEY IS I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM AT LEAST THE MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO SO IN OTHER WORDS THIS SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE THE MAJORITY OF ITS MEMBERS. ARE NOT WILLING. TO PUT INTO LAW. THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD AS IT EXISTS TODAY -- BUT WE DO NOT HAVE BEFORE US A BILL THAT PROPOSES THE REVISED MEANING TODAY IN THIS COMMITTEE. THE BILL THAT PROPOSES A REVISED USE OF FORCE IS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER SPELL SO IN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS. WHAT THIS COMMITTEE THOUGHT WAS REASONABLE WAS? TO LINK THE BILLS. SO THAT. THIS BILL WOULD ONLY BECOME LAW. IF THERE IS A REVISED USE OF FORCE MEANING AB. THREE NINETY TWO AND THE REASON THAT I IS THE COMMITTEE CHAIR. WAS WILLING TO HAVE A PORTION OF SB. TWO THIRTY MOVE FORWARD IS BECAUSE IF WE DO RE VICE OUR USE OF FORCE STANDARD. THEN WE WILL REQUIRE NEW TRAINING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THE ONLY TRAINING THAT OUR STATE WIDE AGENCY OFFERS IS ON THE EXISTING STANDARD. AND SO IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN REVISING THE STANDARD. AND MAKING IT MORE FAIR OR HOWEVER ANYONE WANTS TO CHARACTERIZE. THE REVISION. THEN WE WOULD NEED NEW TRAINING BECAUSE IF WE DON'T GET NEW TRAINING THEN OFFICERS WOULD STILL BE OPERATING UNDER THE OLD ONE SO THAT'S WHY AT LEAST AS CHAIR I WAS WILLING. TO HAVE THE TRAINING PORTION CONTINUE BUT ONLY IF IT IS BASED ON A REVISED USE OF FORCE STANDARD. SO -- AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO ALSO. THE THE ISSUE AROUND -- AROUND THE BIAS. AND CITING FROM A STUDY THAT I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH UNTIL JUST RECENTLY [inaudible] BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE -- INTERESTED IN THIS STUDIES DATING BACK TO AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND AND ONE FOUND THAT THE SAME AS REGULAR RESIDENTS. POLICE OFFICERS CIVILIANS RESIN. ANYONE EVERYONE HERE IN OUR CULTURE ARE CONSISTENTLY MORE LIKELY TO ASSOCIATE BLACK FACES WITH CRIMINALITY. ENTER MISIDENTIFIED COMMON OBJECTS AS WEAPONS. AFTER BEING SHOWN PHOTOS OF BLACK FACES. SO IN OTHER WORDS. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OR ANY OF US. THE STUDY SHOW. REACT AFTER WE SEE. PICTURES OF BLACK FACES. WE REACT BOTH AN ASSOCIATE CRIMINALITY. AND ASSUME THAT OBJECTS THAT ARE NOT WEAPONS OUR WEAPONS. SO THIS AND THIS IS WHAT WE REFER TO AS IMPLICIT BIAS. WHICH FEW NONE OF US ARE FREE OF AND SO IN OUR WORK. TO CREATE A MORE JUST. LAWS AND MORE JUST. APPLICATION OF THEM WE HAVE TO HAVE THE TRAINING. BOTH ON THE IMPLICIT BIAS IN ON WHATEVER NEW REVISED USE OF FORCE STANDARD THAT WE HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADOPT [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] NOW. I WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN. I WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN HAVING THE VOTE. TAKEN AFTER CAUCUS. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE IT TAKEN AT THE END OF THE HEARING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE HEARING WILL END. TODAY GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SO MANY MORE BILL STILL TO ENTERTAIN. BUT I EXPECT THE CAUCUS TO GO FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR AND A HALF. AND THAT WAY MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE COME TODAY WHETHER. IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSE COULD THEN SEE THE MARK UP AND IN ADDITION. TO THE PRINTED OUT HERE IN THE THE BILL PLEASE. IN ADDITION TO YES THANK YOU IN ADDITION TO THIS VERSION. WE WILL HAVE. THESE WHICH ARE AS YOU FEAR ALL OVER THE PLACE [inaudible] WE HAVE. USE THE PEN AND STRUCTURE ROOF THE PORTIONS THAT ARE BEING DELETED IF THE COMMITTEE ACCEPTS THE AMENDMENTS. WHICH ARE IT'S CAN BE MUCH EASIER -- TO READ AND TO SEE. SO W WILL. DO THAT WITH AS MANY OF THESE AS POSSIBLE AND OF COURSE YOU CAN ASSIST IF YOU -- USE THIS TO ALSO DO THAT SO THAT. AGAIN THOSE FOLKS HERE EITHER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WILL KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO BE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AT LEAST ONE OF THE MOTIONS THERE MAY BE ANOTHER MOTION. THAT IS TO ACCEPT THE BILL AS WRITTEN I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THAT BUT AT LEAST THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE. FOR THE BILL TO BE ACCEPTED IN THE AMENDED VERSION THAT IS -- STRUCK THROUGH HERE AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY STAFF -- MARK UP ENOUGH OF THE SO AT LEAST LOTS OF FOLKS CAN SEE THEM. SO. XEROX IT HOWEVER ALL RIGHT NOW. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUES. BUT ADDITIONALLY WHETHER -- OBVIOUSLY. THE AUTHOR MAY HAVE AND IS ENTITLED -- TO RESPOND -- BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- EVEN IF WE HAD PUT THE BILL IN PRINT. AS A AND AGREED TO AMENDMENTS EARLIER I THINK THAT MANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED TO BE HEARING YOU MAY OPPOSED OR NOT OPPOSED. I DO GREATLY APPRECIATE HOW TRAUMATIC IT IS TO TALK ABOUT. THE LOSS OF YOUR LOVED ONES. AGAIN AND TO DO IT IN PUBLIC AND IT'S INCREDIBLY COURAGEOUS AND BRAVE BUT I ALSO WANT TO RESPECT THAT. IT IS AS DIFFICULT AS IT IS I THANK ALL OF YOU WANT US TO BEAR PUBLIC WITNESS TO IT. AND SO I THINK THAT EVEN IF WE HAD. THE BILL -- AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF YOU TO SEE YOU WOULD HAVE WANTED TO COME AND SPEAK TO US ANYWAY BECAUSE IT THIS CONVERSATION IS NECESSARY FOR US TO HAVE. AS WE CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REVISION TO OUR USE OF FORCE STANDARDS SOMEONE OF HONOR YOUR COMING HERE AND YOU'RE SPEAKING. AND I AM THE DIFFICULTY OF IT AND YET I THINK ALSO THAT. AS MUCH AS IT'S DIFFICULT THAT YOU WANT US TO BE OUR THAT WITNESS AND I HONOR THAT SENATOR COPIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE OMMITTEE. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT AVE BEEN MADE -- BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- AND AND I AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD SUGGESTION TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS I SOMEONE AT THINK EVERYBODY THAT CAME HERE TODAY -- I KNOW THAT -- IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO COME. AND TO CONTINUE TO TESTIFYING TO CONTINUE. TO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT -- AND IT'S EQUALLY AS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SIT HERE AND TO I EXTEND TO YOU MY AT MOST CONDOLENCES FOR THE LOSS OF LIFE. AND OF YOUR LOVED ONES AND I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY YEAR -- YOUR ENERGY AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO MAKING CHANGE AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I HONOR THAT IN THAT I RESPECTED GREATLY. AND THAT THAT'S THE REASON I'M HERE IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME CHANGE AND IT HAS TO BE SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE -- THE BILL AS IT IS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE WE END UP TALKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF THE HOW WE DEAL WITH BILLS HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT THE BOTTOM LINE. IS THE PART THAT PERTAINS TO AB THREE NINETY TWO HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT. OF MY BILL. AND SO THE ONLY PART THAT TALKS ABOUT THE USE OF FORCE -- YET IT'S STANDARD IS IN DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER SPELL. AND THAT WAS DONE AS A WAY. AND MY BILL IS LINKED WITH HERS SO OF HERS DOESN'T GET THROUGH THEN IT IT ALL DISAPPEARS I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT IT ALL TO DISAPPEAR I THINK WE WANT TO GET SOME RESOLUTION. AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT KEEPS EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE. NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION AND THAT'S THAT THAT WAS MY COMMITMENT TO THE CHAIR AND THAT WAS REALLY -- WHY WE DECIDED TO MAKE THE AMENDS AT THIS POINT -- SO THAT WE COULD -- CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE WORKING ON I'M SO I'M COMMITTED TO THAT -- I KNOW THAT ALL OF MY SPONSORS ARE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT -- AND WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT DOCTOR WEBER AND IT IT'S GOING THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT SO -- I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY BECAUSE THIS THIS IS PART OF THE THIS IS PART OF A DEMOCRACY IS HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS IN THESE AND WORKING THROUGH THIS AND I REALLY -- HONOR AND RESPECT -- BUT WHAT WHAT DONE SENATOR -- AT BRADFORD AND SENATOR MITCHELL I HAVE TO SAY ON THE WHOLE ON THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THEIR THEY ARE -- GREAT COLLEAGUES AND I TRUST THEM IMPLICITLY AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A RESOLUTION ON THIS SO -- WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUT WILL MOVE THIS ON AGAIN I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DOCTOR WEBER ON ON HER BILL. AS WELL AND AND AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION SO WE CAN WE CAN RESOLVE THIS ISSUE THIS YEAR RIGHT SO. WE ARE -- GOING TO GOING RECESS NOW. THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WILL TAKE RECESS BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR MEETINGS CONCLUDE WE'LL RETURN. AND WE WILL THEN -- ENTERTAIN -- WHATEVER MOTIONS -- AND I EXPECT THERE WILL BE A MOTION. ON THE AMENDMENTS. AND THEN THE BILL WITH AS AMENDED. OF BUT WE WILL DO THAT WHEN WE CAN -- COME BACK AND THAT WILL BE AT ONE THIRTY AND WE WILL BE IN THIS ROOM OKAY. THANK YOU ALL ACTUALLY. PORTANTINO'S SO SORRY MR NO JONES AFTER HE'S AFTER OKAY SO CENTER PORTANTINO AYE TO TO START UP. SORRY CENTER JONES YOU ARE GEORGIANNE WE ARE GOING FILE ORDERING HE'S BEFORE YOU. AND ALSO -- WE ARE GOING TO HOLD OFF ON THE VOTE I'D PROMISED BEFORE INTO WE HAVE MORE THE MEMBERS IN THE ROOM. AND I AM GOING TO ENSURE -- DO MY BILL DIRECTLY FOLLOWING YOURS BECAUSE OF LATER AND I WILL NEED TO LEAVE TO GO TO CHIU DISH FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO THE ORDER WILL BE CENTER PORTANTINO. MINE AND THEN WHATEVER AUTHORS IN THE ROOM THAT'S FILE ORDER OKAY GO AHEAD CENTER PORTANTINO. THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE MORE IF YOU MORE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME GO I HAVE -- AT A TOWN -- WITNESSES WHO HAVE TO CATCH A FLIGHT AND I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY TAKING THE AMENDMENTS PRESENTED BY THE COMMITTEE AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR CONTINUED WORK WITH MY OFFICE -- TODAY I AM PRESENTING SB SIX TWENTY WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE SPECIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO FURNISH LIMITED. INFORMATION ABOUT A PERSON ON SUPERVISED RELEASE WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION TO NONPROFIT PROVIDERS OF SERVICES. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE PERSON ON SUPERVISED RELEASE TO BE NOTIFIED THAT THEIR INFORMATION CAN BE RELEASED FOR THE PURPOSE FOR THAT PURPOSE AND WHEN ALLOW THOSE PERSONS STOPPED IN TO HAVING THEIR INFORMATION. RELEASED SO THEY CAN IF THEY CHOOSE WHEN SOMEONE IS RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION THEY ARE RETURNED TO THEIR CITY OF RESIDENCE WITHOUT FRANKLY -- THE GUIDANCE OR NEEDED RESOURCES OFTEN TIMES TO GET. HER LIFE BACK ON TRACK IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY 47% OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO RETURNED FROM INCARCERATION REPEAT. OFFENDER IN A RE INCARCERATION RE INCARCERATED WITHIN THREE YEARS. THIS RESULTS FRANKLY IN A PREVENTABLE -- SITUATION IF WE PROVIDE SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS I THINK. THEY'D BE BETTER OFF AND WE'D ALL BE BETTER OFF SO. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE RELEASED DATA AND THE PERSONNEL INFORMATION OF EVERY PERSON ON PAROLE -- WHO SUPERVISED BY PROBATION HOWEVER THEY CANNOT CONNECT THESE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS -- IN PARTICULAR MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A ROBUST -- SUPPORT SYSTEM OF NONPROFITS WHO DESPERATELY WANT TO HELP AND OFTEN ARE PREVENTED FROM KNOWING WHO. IS IN NEED OF THAT HELP SO IT'S HARD TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF RECIDIVISM IF WE CAN'T CONNECT PEOPLE TO THE SERVICES SO BY HAVING. CONTACT INFORMATION OF THOSE RETURNING TO SOCIETY SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS AND GRANT FUNDS ON PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WITH THE HELP OUR JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THOSE LEAVING THE SYSTEM TO HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO CASE MANAGEMENT FINANCIAL LITERACY MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. AND FRANKLY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE PASSED ANY AS CHIEF OF POLICE JOHN PRESS AND LIEUTENANT JASON CLAWSON ALSO FROM THE PAST NEEDED POLICE DEPARTMENT TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. THANK YOU CAN PRETTY. THANK YOU SO WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY. SB SIX TWENTY REALLY A GAME CHANGER WE BELIEVE IT'S ABILITY TO YOU KNOW JORDAN THE GAP AND CONNECT PEOPLE -- INTO THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED IN THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE FOR THOSE OUT OF INCARCERATION AND IT IS A A TWELVE YEAR JOURNEY THAT WE'VE HAD IN PASADENA WITH A GRASSROOTS EFFORT. A DURING A RECESSION WHEN WE WHEN THE BUDGET -- WE'RE BEING CUT AND REDUCE OF THOSE ELIMINATION OF THE A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PEOPLE WERE OUT OF INCARCERATION FOR THE LONG FOR SPENT AND COMMUNITY GROUPS MET TO PROVIDE RESOURCES IMPOSSIBLE JOBS. THAT WENT AWAY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE OR TEN LEAVING US A WITH NOTHING SO THE FASHION POLICE DEPARTMENT IS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. PUT TOGETHER AS A SAID A GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO REALLY BRING IN NON PROFITS TOGETHER AND GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE THAT ARE OUT OF JAILS AND PRISONS A CHANCE TO PUT THEIR LIVES BACK IN TRACK. AND IT WAS TOUGH IN THE EARLY YEARS THERE WAS NO MONEY -- THERE WAS NOTHING AVAILABLE FOR US -- OVER TIME WE DID -- BUILT A REPUTATION LOCALLY AND IN GETTING THIS DONE NOT JUST FOR PASADENA BUT THE REGION. AND WERE ABLE TO GET CAL GRIP FUNDING OF PROP FORTY SEVEN FIGHTING CAL BIT FUNDING TO REALLY HAS PROVIDED THAT MODEL TO BE PUSHED OUT LITTLE BIT FURTHER AND BRING IN OTHER TYPE OF ORGANIZATIONS. AND RECEIVE THIS MONEY CURRENTLY WE HAVE A PROP FORTY SEVEN GRANT LIEUTENANT CLAUSSEN HAS BEEN OPERATING WITH ONLY POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN GRANTED THIS. THIS GRANT SO IT'S IT'S IT'S AN OFFERING A REALLY IS BENEFICIAL FOR US -- AT THE END OF THIS EFFORT. THERE ARE STILL GAPS THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE -- THIS CAN CHANGE THE SUBJECT REFER PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST SOULS COMING OUT OF PRISON BUT THEIR FAMILIES. WHEN YOU SIT IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AS I HAVE AND THEY'RE OUT OF INCARCERATION AND YOU ASK THEM WHAT THEY NEED AND THE BEEN IN JAIL FOR VIOLENT CRIME AT FIRST IS VERY DIFFICULT? TO MAKE THAT STEP OVER TO SAY WELL DO YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN FOR VIOLENT CRIME WAS IT YOU NEED TO KEEP YOU OUT SOMETIMES A SIMPLE IS JUST SERVICES. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO ROOM FOR THEIR KIDS THINGS TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER AND SO WE PROVIDED THEM OVER THE YEARS. WE'VE HAD SIXTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE GO THROUGH OUR PROGRAM. AND WE KNOW THAT THE STATE RECIDIVIST I'M RATES IT'S AT ABOUT 60% JUST ABOVE THAT THE COUNTY WAS ABOUT. FORTY SEVEN OF PASADENA IS IT. RECIDIVISM RATES ABOUT 35% THOSE THAT GO TO THIS PROGRAM IT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT 15% AS A WE KNOW IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WE KNOW WE HAVE IMPACT. WHEN YOU SIT IN A ROOM AND AND SPEAK TO PEOPLE IT IS A WHO'S BEEN TO PRISON AND THEY'RE COMING OUT THEY NEED SERVICES IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE THE BEST PART WE HAVE SIGNED IT WITH THIS? IS THE FACT TAT -- THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR POLICE OFFICERS AND PEOPLE COMING OUT OF PRISONS AND JAILS HAS IMPROVED WE WANT TO SEE A A POSITIVE OUTCOME OF THIS IS THE CONSTANT CONNECTION THAT THEY HAVE ONE ANOTHER. TO GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER AND I THINK IN THE LONG RUN THAT'S GOING TO BENEFIT SOCIETY SO I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT AND AND YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU -- YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THE VERY IMMERSED INTO. FIVE I'M. SORRY SORRY HOW MANY DAYS LIKE LAWSON. I'M A LIEUTENANT WITH PASSED IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF A BEING IMMERSED IN THIS PROGRAM FOR THE PAST ALMOST TEN YEARS NOW -- I'VE DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE GETTING OUTOF PRISON I KNOW THE RESTATEMENT GREET RESOURCES WE HAVE A FRIENDSHIP PREPARATION PROGRAM WHICH ACTUALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO GET TRAINED INTO THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. AND THEY ACTUALLY GET JOBS AND IT FEELS GOOD THAT SOMEBODY WHO WILL YELL OUT MY NAME DROPPED ON THEIR REGULAR CELL AND RUN OVER TO ME AND GIVE ME A HUG TO SAY LOOK YOU GUYS CHANGED MY LIFE. I DON'T HAVE A JOB ANYMORE I HAVE A CAREER SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THE BENCHMARKS OF SUCCESS THAT I SEE EVERY DAY FROM THE PEOPLE. AND WE LEAVE. WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS A GAP BECAUSE ON MY PHONE RIGHT NOW I HAVE EVERY PAROLE LEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW WAS MOM'S NAME. AND NO WORRIES LIVE IN I HAVE A CELL PHONE NUMBER BUT BY LAW I CANNOT CONNECT THOSE RESOURCES THAT I'M INVOLVED IN TO THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED AND I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BREAK THAT GAP. AND GET PEOPLE AT THE TO THE SERVICES THAT THAT TO PROVIDE THEM TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE AND I COULD NOT RETURN TO INCARCERATIONS. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OKAY. TO BEGIN WITH A SILLY OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE ON THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEES WORK ON THIS AND WE ARE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION.

MEMBERS IS THERE A MOTION. SENATOR WIENER. I'M A MOVE THE BILL AS AMENDED. RIGHT AS AMENDED BY -- BOTH WHAT THE AUTHOR STATED IN WHAT I IS THAT YOUR READ. CORRECT RIGHT AND OF THE CRYSTAL CLEAR AGAIN I MOVING THE BILL IN THE IN THE FORM WITH THE AMENDMENTS MEANING THAT THE USE OF FORCE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY STRIPPED OUT OF THE BILL.

THE BILL IS ON CALL. I'M. SO WE WILL RETURN TO IT WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS. AND WILL NOW HEAR FROM CENTER RUBIO GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB. TWO SEVENTY THREE THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT ALSO KNOWN AS THE PHOENIX ACT. I WANT TO FIRST THINK THAT CHAIR IN HER COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY OFFICE AND I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO EXTEND THE STATURE LIMITATIONS TO TENURE. SB TWO SEVENTY THREE WOULD NOT ONLY EXTEND THE SPATULA MEDITATION FOR SURVIVORS. WE NEED TIME TO HEAR TO HEAL PRIOR TO COMING FORWARD BUT THIS BILL WILL ALSO PROVIDE CRITICAL NEEDED TRAINING FOR PEACE OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THIS BILL REQUIRES CLAIMS TO BE EVIDENCE BASED AT THAT INCLUDES AUDIO VIDEO RECORDING SUPPORTER GRASS WERE WRITTEN AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION THAT PROVIDE EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO CHARGE THE PERPETRATORS. WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO EMPOWER DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS I HAVE THE GREAT HONOR TO BE JOINED BY COURAGEOUS LEADERS AND ADVOCATES IN THE FIGHT AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE MUST ENSURE THE SAFETY OF VICTIMS ALLOW THEM TO SEEK JUSTICE WITH ENOUGH TIME TO HEAL FROM THEIR TRAUMA. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A HORRIBLE CRIME THAT INFLICTS A HEAVY TOLL ON ITS VICTIMS. AS I ADDRESS HERE YOU HERE TODAY. I CAN'T HELP BUT RECALL MY OWN EXPERIENCE MY OWN TRAUMA. AS I TOO AM A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHEN IT COMES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE STATISTICS ARE GRAHAM? IN AMERICA AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY WOMEN ARE SHOT TO DEATH BY THEIR INTIMATE PARTNERS EVERY MONTH. AND MANY MORE ARE INJURED. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CYCLE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION MORE THAN ONE AND MORE THAN ONE IN THREE WOMEN. AND MORE THAN ONE OF FOUR MEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE EXPERIENCE RATE PHYSICAL VIOLENCE FOR STOCKING. RIGHT INTO MY PARTNER IN THEIR LIFETIME. WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES HAVE A PARTNER VIOLENCE IT ALSO AFFECTS MARGINALIZE PEOPLE OF COLOR AT A GREATER NUMBERS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALSO AFFECTS CHILDREN. BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE SANGRO VALLEY A WOMAN NAMED ANNA STATUS A CONSTITUENT OF MINE. LOST HER FIVE YEAR OLD SON. WHO WE NOW REFER TO LOVE ANY AS PEAKY? HE WAS MURDERED BY ON US EX HUSBAND DESPITE HONEST EFFORTS TO GAIN SOLE CUSTODY DUE TO THE ALLEGATIONS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WHEN HE COULDN'T HURT HER? HE TURNED TO HER SON. DATA SHOWS MULTIPLE REASONS WHY SURVIVORS OF ABUSE MAY NOT COME OVER IT WITHIN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS INCLUDING THEIR AGE AT THE TIME OF THE USE. ON GOING TRAUMA THREATS FROM THE PERPETRATOR OR LACK OF EVIDENCE. AS I SHARED EARLIER THIS ISSUE IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. MY STORY WAS PUBLICIZING THE MEDIA HUNDREDS OF WOMEN CAME OVER TO TELL ME ABOUT THEIR TRAUMA. ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR SHARED HER STORY ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR. ABUSE THAT SHE HAD TO INDOOR. AND EVEN AFTER HER RELATIONSHIP ENDED SHE NEVER HAD THE TO TELL ANYONE. LET'S NOT MAKE THE STATUE OF LIMITATION ONE MORE HURDLE. THEN AND ALREADY BROKE. TRAUMATIZED BIG DUMB STILL HAS TO JUMP. THIS IS WHY SB TWO SEVENTY THREE IS A VERY CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION. BUT WHEN THEY DO FIND THE COURAGE TO SEEK JUSTICE WE MUST ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE FUTURE SAFETY OF OTHERS. ME HERE TODAY IS EVAN RACHEL WOOD A SURVIVOR AN ADVOCATE. FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO. CENTER SKINNER AND THE COMMITTEE -- WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I MET A MAN? I LOOKED UP TO HIM IN MANY WAYS INFO LIKE WE HAD A SPECIAL BOND AND I HAD NO INTENTION OF TURNING INTO SOMETHING ROMANTIC. WHEN IT EVENTUALLY DID I WASN'T SURE HOW TO STOP IT AS HE HAD A CERTAIN CHARISMA AND POWER IN A QUICKLY SURRENDERED TO HIS CHARMS? IN THE BEGINNING HE TREATED ME LIKE A PRINCESS I WAS SMART BUT SMART EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD TO STILL IN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AND I THOUGHT I HAD PHONE LOVE. IT WASN'T UNTIL MUCH LATER THAT I REALIZED EVERYTHING YOU TOLD ME WAS A LIE AND PART OF WHAT IS CALLED THE GROOMING PROCESS HE DIDN'T A TERRIBLE DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROBLEM FOR ME. FAST IN A RELATIONSHIP ASKING ME TO MOVE IN WITH HIM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THERE'S A CERTAIN WAY HE WANTED ME TO LOOK OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T OR NAME CALLING AND RITUAL. HE CUT ME OFF FOR MY CLOSE FRIENDS AND FAMILY ONE BY ONE BY EXHIBITING RAGE IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER WHEN I WAS IN CONTACT WITH THEM. THE ONLY WAY NEWT ECONOMIST A GIVEN WHAT HE WANTED WHICH WAS ME ALL TO HIMSELF IN TOTAL ISOLATION. HE HAD BOUTS OF EXTREME JEALOUSY WHICH WOULD OFTEN RESULT IN HIM WRECKING OUR HOME CORNING ME IN A ROOM AND THREATENING ME. I WOULD MISS MY VIEWS ARE STARTING PEOPLE WITH FORCE OR LEGAL ACTION IF YOU WORRIED THEY WOULD EXPOSE HIM HE BRAGGED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE KILLED BECAUSE HE WAS ALLEGEDLY FRIENDS WITH MULTIPLE GANGS AND I WATCHED ILLEGALLY COLLECT DATA ON PEOPLE THAT HE COULD USE HIS BLACKMAIL. BY THE TIME I REALIZED I WAS IN A BAD SITUATION I FELT COMPLETELY TRAPPED IN TERRIFIED FOR MY LIFE. HE GIFTED ME A CELL PHONE WHICH I FOUND OUT HE WAS MONITORING E DOWNLOADED SPY WARE ON TO MY COMPUTER AND HACKED INTO MY EMAILS AND SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS SO I COULD NOT REACH OUT FOR HELP. MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TRY TO INTERVENE I SIMPLY TOLD THEM TO LEAVE BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT HE WOULD DO. HE BROKE ME DOWN THROUGH MEANS OF STARVATION SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND THREATS AGAINST MY LIFE SOMETIMES WITH DEADLY WEAPONS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN ME HAVING SEVERE PANIC ATTACKS WHERE I WAS UNABLE TO BREATHE OR STOP SHAKING. SOMETIMES YOU WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO SLEEP UNTIL I PARTICIPATED IN ACTS OF FEAR PAIN. TORTURE AND HUMILIATION WHICH I FELT POWERLESS TO STOP. IN SOME OF THESE TAPES. WHICH HE ALSO VIDEOTAPED. IN SOME OF THESE TAPES HE CAN BE HEARD THREATENING TO KILL ME THREATEN MY FRIENDS ARE THREATENING TO KILL MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY. HE ALSO THREATENED TO LEAK PARTS OF THE FOOTAGE OR PHOTOGRAPHS YOU TAKEN AS A WAY TO KEEP ME QUIET. I MUSTERED THE COURAGE TO LEAVE SEVERAL TIMES BUT HE WOULD CALL MY HOUSE INCESSANTLY AND THREATENED TO KILL HIMSELF. ON ONE OCCASION I RETURNED TO TRYING TO FUSE THE SITUATION HE CORNERED ME IN OUR BEDROOM AND ASKED ME TO KNEEL WELL HE TIED ME UP BY MY HANDS AND FEET. ONCE I WAS RESTRAINED HE BEAT ME. AND SHOT SENSITIVE PARTS OF MY BODY WITH A TORTURE DEVICE CALLED A VIOLENT. ONE TO HIM IT WAS A WAY FOR ME TO PROVE MY LOYALTY. THE WORST PART WAS I STILL FELT IT WAS SOMEHOW MY FAULT BECAUSE SOCIETY HAD TOLD ME I SHOULD JUST LEAVE WHEN SOMEONE HITS ME BUT THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED AND SO MUCH SCARIER THAN ANYTHING HAD EVER PREPARED ME FOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT. AFTER THIS INCIDENT I PLAYED ALONG WITH WHATEVER HE WANTED AND DURING CONSTANT DAILY ABUSE AND ON OCCASION RIGHT UNTIL I FOUND A WAY TO ESCAPE SAFELY. YEARS LATER MY THERAPIST WOULD IDENTIFY THIS A STOCKHAM SYNDROME. ONCE I WAS FINALLY OUT OF MY FEEL SAFE WHICH MEANT PUTTING TIME AND SPACE BETWEEN ME HIM IN THE ABUSE. THE SHAME IS STILL OVERWHELMING AND IT'S TAKEN ALL OF MY STRENGTH TO SPEAK PUBLICLY AND TO PURSUE THIS EVEN TODAY. THE FEAR BEING JUDGED BY SOCIETY IS DEBILITATING AND THE FEAR OF RETALIATION FROM MY ABUSER IS PARALYZING. BY SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY AND EVERYDAY I PUT MYSELF AT RISK AS I HAVE NO PROTECTION. I HAD TO GO THROUGH INTENSE THERAPY TO EVEN FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME AND I'VE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COMPLEX PTSD. I'M STILL IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH THIS. THE FINAL PUSH INTO CREATING THE PHOENIX ACT WITH THE CRUSHING REALIZATION YEARS LATER THAT HE HAD DONE THIS TO SEVERAL PEOPLE AND IT WAS VERY LIKELY THEY WERE MORE VICTIMS. SO I TRIED TO TAKE MY EVIDENCE TO THE STATE AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE. MY EVIDENCE INCLUDED PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEO NOT JUST RELYING ON MEMORY. CANNOT BE VIEWED BY THE STATE BECAUSE THE SUCH A LIMITATION SO MANY CASES RUN OUT. AND I'VE LIVED TO WITH THE SILENCE AND SHAME FOR TOO LONG AND IT HAS BEEN UNBEARABLE. IT'S TAKING YEARS FROM MY LIFE BECAUSE I WAS TOO AFRAID TO TELL ANYONE. I KNOW THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT AFFECT MY CASE BUT I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE PHOENIX ACT TO CREATE A CUSHION FOR VICTIMS TO LEAVE THEIR DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. GET THE HELP THEY NEED I COME BACK FROM THE TRAUMA IN ORDER TO PURSUE JUSTICE AND STOP SERIAL ABUSERS AS LONG AS THEY HAVE UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE. WE DO NOT WISH TO CREATE NEW LAWS ARE HARSHER PUNISHMENTS ONLY MORE TIME IF THE EVIDENCE MEETS THE CRITERIA WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME FOR HEARING US TODAY. ADAM SHARE I'M SORRY I FEEL TO TO ALSO SAY THIS SHE BACK ACROSS ANOTHER SURVIVOR SPHERE WITH ME TO TELL HER. STORY THANK YOU GO AHEAD. THANK YOU SENATOR IN COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SENATE COMMITTEE. I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M HERE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE PHOENIX AT SB. TWO SEVEN THREE I'M INTRODUCED BY SENATOR RUBIO BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WAS DRAFTED IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTCRY FROM PEOPLE LIKE ME SURVIVORS AN EVENT. FOR THE NEED TO X.. GO AND EXTEND SUCH OF LIMITATION AS IT PERTAINS TO PROSECUTION OF OF PERPETRATORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SHIFT THE FOCS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS LAW. FROM. PROSECUTION OF PERPETRATORS TO BEING A TOOL FOR CURRENT VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IPV. I SHARE MY STORY BECAUSE I HOPE THAT I CAN SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CHANGE NOT ONLY FOR ME. BUT FOR THE THOUSAND NAMELESS AND FACELESS WOMEN THAT ARE CURRENTLY FACING WHAT I FACE AT THE YOUNG AGE OF TWELVE CAN YOU IMAGINE ME AT TWELVE MY EXPERIENCE MY FIRST PUNCH MY FIRST LAP MY FIRST TASTE OF STRANGULATION BECAUSE IPV EXTENSIVE THOSE WHO TARGET YOUNG GIRLS LIKE ME. FORCING ME TO BECOME AN INTIMATE PARTNER AS WELL AS A VICTIM VICTIM OF HUMAN AND SEX TRAFFICKING. I STARTED HERE BECAUSE I HAD DEVELOPED AT A YOUNG AGE WHAT RELATIONSHIPS AND ABUSE LOOK LIKE AS NORMAL. AT EIGHTEEN BOYFRIENDS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONTINI PEOPLE PART OF EVERY RELATIONSHIP. VIOLENCE WAS NOT DOMESTIC IT WAS JUST MY BOYFRIEND AND THAT'S HOW BOYS TO GIRLS. AT TWENTY I CONTINUE THE CYCLE HAVING FROM ONE RELATIONSHIP TO THE NEXT BEING BEATEN TO THE GROUND. AND I STILL DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WAS VIOLENCE. I'M EMBARRASSED TO SHARE AS AS SOMEONE WHO'S VERY STRONG RESPECTED IN MY COMMUNITY AND ELECTED OFFICIAL. THAT WAS UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT I REALIZED THAT I WAS ALSO A VICTIM OF AN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE IT TOOK ME TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO REALIZE THAT IT WAS VIOLENCE IT WAS AGAINST ALONG. AND I KNOW I HAD THE POWER TO DO SOMETHING. IF I HAD STARTED THIS INFAMOUS CLOCK. AN ACTIVATED THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS TIMER I WOULD HAVE LAPSED THE CURRENT LAW TWENTY SIX TIMES. ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT LAW I ONLY HAD ONE THREE YEARS TO STEP ONE COME TO TERMS THE FACT MY RELATIONSHIP WAS VIOLENT TEP. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS AGAINST THE LAW STEP THREE HOW TO NAVIGATE THE LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE HARDEST STEP STEP FOR THE MOST CONSUMING AN INDIVIDUALIZED AFTER. GATHERING THE COURAGE TO GO TO THE POLICE WHICH NORMALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I AM SHOWING THAT IT TOOK ME TWENTY SEVEN YEARS TO WRITE TO STEP. AND NOW A FEW FEW MORE YEARS HAVE PASSED AND I CREEP TOWARDS THAT. FOR NO I WHAT I KNOW TODAY I CAN'T IMAGINE GETTING TO THIS FINAL STEP ESTABLISH THE COURAGE TO FILE CHARGES AND BE TOLD THAT THE LAW TO PROTECT BECAUSE I PASSED THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. IT WOULD JUST AGAIN RE TRIGGER MY TRAUMA AND TRAUMATIZED ME. I'M HERE TO SAY IN SACRAMENTO BEING VULNERABLE. AND IF I WOULD HAVE HAD THE RESOURCES THAN. TO BE ABLE TO COME UP AND TALK ABOUT THIS IN THE PAST I WOULD HAVE. BUT I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE THE FIFTH STEP WITH ME. AND THAT STEP IS TO PUT A HOLD ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND I HOPE THAT ALL THE LEGISLATORS TO HEAR ME AND WATCH THESE VIDEOS TODAY. AND TAKE A STEP IN VOTING YES TO SUPPORT SB TWO SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOUR NAME TO STATE YOUR NAME. MY NAME IS ELAINE WHITE FEATHER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY FOR PEACE. LARGELY MARTIN THIRTY TWO YEARS SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE -- YES PLEASE. MY NAME IS REGINA RENEE AND I'M A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR. AND IFOUND OUT THAT I MISSED MY WINDOW FOR JUSTICE AND I SUPPORT -- SB TWO SEVENTY THREE THE PHOENIX ACT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. I'M KATE RANTA AMID DOMESTIC INCOME VIOLENCE SURVIVOR PLEASE VOTE YES. I'M ACTUALLY GOAL -- I'M A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VIA AND I FOR YES. OKAY THRILL SURVIVOR OF SEVERE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. PLEASE VOTE YES. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF. ONE OR TWO OF YOU LEAVE THE TABLE WHICHEVER [inaudible] SURE. GOOD AFTERNOON LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS SERVE A VITAL HUMBLE PUBLIC FUNCTION BY PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AND I QUOTE. FROM DEFENDING STATE CLAIMS WERE FACTUAL OBSCURITY THROUGH THE LOSS OF TIME MEMORY OR SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION MAYBE PRESENT. PRINT MAY PRESENT UNFAIR HANDICAPS TO QUOTE FROM THE COURTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PROSECUTION IS GIVEN THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF AN ALLEGED OFFENSE TO INVESTIGATE AND DETERMINE WHETHER CHARGES ARE WARRANTED. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS INSURES THAT THE STATE ACTS PROMPTLY TO INVESTIGATE A COMPLAINT WHILE ALSO GUARANTEEING THAT ANY PERSON FALSELY ACCUSED OF SUCH AN OFFENSE NEED NOT SPEND A DECADE OR MORE. PRESERVING EVIDENCE OR WAITING THE LATEST WHIM OF FILING PROSECUTORS. SB TWO SEVENTY THREE PROPOSES TO REPLACE THIS CAREFUL CALCULUS WITH THE NUMBER. WITH NO RHYME OR REASON IN SO DOING SB SEVEN TO SEVENTY THREE OF THREATENS THE ABILITY OF THOSE FALSELY ACCUSED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. THIS RESULTS. THIS RESULT THREATENS THE INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY. WE DON'T HAVE TO SAY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS OKAY BUT WE DO NEED TO ESTABLISH REASONABLE RULES OF LAW. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO AND WE REQUEST A NO VOTE. ON SB. TWO SEVENTY THREE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MIGHT AND MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- WE APPRECIATE. THE IT AMENDMENTS TO THE BELL AND THE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER OUR CONCERNS AND AND NARROW THE SCOPE. HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED. TO THE BILL UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS -- ENTIRELY -- WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE GOAL OF PROMOTING JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOWEVER WE FEAR THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL. WILL BOTH TO THREATEN DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS AND REMOVE THE INCENTIVE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS TO MORE SWIFTLY ADDRESS REPORTS OF DOMESTIC PARTNER VIOLENCE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. AS MY COLLEAGUE EXPRESSED AT A FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS HELP TO ENSURE THAT DEFENDANTS RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL. HOWEVER IN ADDITION TO ENSURING FAIRNESS THIS OF CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS ALSO NOTED THAT STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ENCOURAGE THE SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. HOPEFULLY PRODUCING A STRONGER DETERRENT EFFECT. SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN A STATEWIDE STUDIED MORE THAN INVOLVING AGGRAVATED PHYSICAL ASSAULT WE'RE NOT PROSECUTED. OTHER RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT WHILE POLICE TEAM JUST A FRACTION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES WORTHY OF INVESTIGATION. PROSECUTORS HAVE APPROACH SUSPICIOUSLY EVEN THOSE CASES THAT POLICE DEEMED TO HAVE THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. EXTENDING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN THESE CASES WILL NOT IMPROVE THESE OUTCOMES AND MAY SERVE ONLY TO FURTHER DISCOURAGE THE SWIFT AND EFFECTIVE. ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. AND MAY WEAKEN THE THREAT OF PROSECUTION FOR THOSE WHO DEMAND WHO COMMIT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CRIMES SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE EAT RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL AND LESS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] GO AHEAD. FUNDAMENTAL REPRESENTING THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IN OPPOSITION OKAY ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT -- BEFORE I CALL ON ANY COLLEAGUES -- I WANT TO SPEAK -- TO THIS BILL I'M. I APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER CITATION OF THE SUPREME COURT'S -- EXPRESSION ON STATURE LIMITATIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE ACLU'S POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER I THINK THAT. WHAT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE? IS THE ABILITY FOR VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY FOR EXAMPLE AROUND RATE. WE ORIGINALLY HAD A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS SOMETIME AGO AT THREE YEARS. THEN LATER WAS TEN YEARS. AND NOW ONLY JUST I THINK IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO ANDERSON RELAVIS BILL. WE REMOVED THE STATUE LIMITATIONS ENTIRELY. NOW CLEARLY THERE HAS TO BE VERY CLEAR EVIDENCE BUT IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT. FOR ANY NUMBER OF A WELL I WANT TO SEE ANY NUMBER LET'S BE LET'S JUST BE REALLY CLEAR AROUND. THE PREJUDICE TOWARDS VICTIMS OF RAPE COMING FORWARD FOR THEIR BEING BELIEVED AND FOR EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKING THEIR CRIME SERIOUSLY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS LED INTO. I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE WHILE I WAS NOT THERE AT THE TIME BUT I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IT HAD I BEEN HERE. WILLINGNESS TO LIFT THAT STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT SEXUAL MOLESTATION OF CHILDREN. FOR FOR YEARS WE HAD A STATUE LIMITATIONS ON THAT NOT RECOGNIZING THAT. FOR MOST CHILDREN. THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT. THAT LED TO THEIR BEING ABLE TO BE SUBJECT TO THAT. ABUSE. WAS. WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. THEY HAD NOT PERSONALLY AN INABILITY TO TELL BUT A SETTING FOR WHICH IT WAS EITHER POWERFUL INDIVIDUALS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. THEY WERE THREATENED OR THEY KNEW THEY COULD NOT TELL AND SO THAT'S IT WAS INTERNALIZED THAT THEY THEMSELVES EITHER ASKED FOR IT. OR DESERVED IT. AND WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS THAT FOR PEOPLE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IT TAKES YEARS FOR THEM TO FINALLY. ACCEPT. THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE VICTIMS OF EAST OF A CRIME. AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO REPORT AND SO WE'VE NOW LIFTED THAT STATUE REVOCATIONS UP TO A PERSON TO BEING UP TO FORTY YEARS OLD. SO WE MADE MANY CHANGES THAT. FIVE BY A STRICT READING OF THE COURT'S OPINION ONE COULD SAY WAS VERY CONTRARY AND YET I THINK WE ALWAYS HAVE TO WEIGH. THE CIRCUMSTANCE WERE MAKING A CHANGE. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT DOMESTIC PARTNER ABUSE. IT TO MY PARTNER VIOLENCE INNER INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE. WHILE IT IS NOT A 100% THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS THE ABUSER GROOMS THE PARTNER. IS VERY COMMON. TO THE POINT WHERE. EITHER BECAUSE OF THEIR GROOMING OR BECAUSE OF THE PARTNERS DEPENDENCE. ON THE ABUSER EITHER FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE. OR ANY NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS. IT IN WE KNOW INDEPENDENT OF BEING ABLE TO REPORT IT IS A CRIME. IT IS VERY COMMON THAT PEOPLE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES STAY IN THEM FOR A LONG TIME. THAT IS WELL DOCUMENTED. AND NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT THE ABUSE BUT BECAUSE THEY FEEL POWERLESS TO GET OUT OF IT. AND EVEN WHEN THEY GET OUT OF IT THEY STILL FEEL POWERLESS TO REPORT. OR TO ACT ON IT THEY STILL FEEL THAT EITHER IT WAS THEIR FAULT. OR THAT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SHAME. SO I THINK ALL OF THAT LENDS ITSELF TO A LEGITIMACY FOR OUR LIFTING A THREE YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. NOW THE BILL HAD RECOMMENDED TWENTY YEARS. I PERSONALLY WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TWENTY YEARS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE BALANCING OF TRYING TO WAY. ON THE VALIDITY OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. I FELT IT WAS APPROPRIATE. TO THIS FIRST STAGE BRING IT TO TEN YEARS AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR WAS WILLING. AND I HOPE THAT THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD IF IT MOVES FORWARD TODAY CAN BE RETAINED AT THAT AND ISN'T SHRUNK FURTHER. BUT OF COURSE WE KNOW SOMETIMES THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND WE MAY HAVE TO ENTERTAIN THIS AGAIN BUT IF WE CERTAINLY LOOK AT THE HISTORY. OF SIMILAR. TYPES OF CRIMES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AROUND THOSE. SOMETIMES WE HAVE. TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE BEFORE WE CAN. POTENTIALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE. WE BALANCE IT EXACTLY RIGHT. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A APPROPRIATING GOOD FIRST STEP. BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT. PERSONS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE ARE IN VERY VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND ALL OF THOSE VULNERABILITIES. CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR BOTH INABILITY TO GET OUT OF THAT ABUSIVE SITUATION AND THEN TO REPORT IT. AND I WANT TO CREATE. BETTER JUSTICE SYSTEM OR PEOPLE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND GIVE THEM THE TIME TO HEAL. SO THAT THEY CAN THEN COME FORWARD. AND THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A LEGAL BARRIER THAT PREVENTS THEIR PERPETRATOR FROM. FROM THAT HAVING TO GO BEFORE JUSTICE. SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL AND AS YOU'VE HEARD ME EXPRESS MY OPINION ON IT I WILL BE RECOMMENDING TO THE CANADIAN AYE VOTE. AND SENATOR WIENER GO AHEAD. THANK YOU -- MAN CHAIR IOWA THANK. YOU AND ALSO CENTER RIVER FOR BEING SO OPEN ABOUT -- YOUR OWN. EXPERIENCES INTO THE WITNESSES TODAY I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT EASY -- AND I SOME. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IT'LL BE LIKE HAVING TO RELIVE EVERYTHING IN PUBLIC BEFORE STRANGERS OF THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COURAGE ON AND ON SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL I ALSO WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY WITH THE WITH THE TWENTY YEARS BUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD -- GOOD RESOLUTION -- AND I THINK IT'S A BIG STEP. AND I AND I KNOW THAT FOR MANY VICTIMS IT DOES TAKE THEM A LONG TIME. TO COME FORWARD THIS IS. NOT IT IS. AND WENT WHEN IT'S A A STRANGER COMING ACROSS AGAINST YOU ON THE STREET THAT'S ALSO TERRIBLE. BUT PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO COME FORWARD TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE REPORT -- WHEN IT IS -- THIS TYPE OF CRIME PEOPLE IT IS SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED PSYCHOLOGICALLY FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED. AND SO I KNOW THIS IS A LIFE. BUT ON TO THE AUTHOR COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY IT IT IS OUR DATA ON HOW LONG ON AVERAGE IT TAKES VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. FIVE TO COME FORWARD AND MAKE THAT REPORT. I HAVE AN EXPERT HERE IF SHE MASTER THAT QUESTION. GO AHEAD ELAINE MY FEATHER FROM A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE AND ALSO A SURVIVOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS. AS A SURVIVOR OF IPV. I AM CURRENTLY GETTING OUT OF AN IPV EVEN AS A DIRECTOR SO I'M HAVING TO OUT MYSELF HERE TODAY. AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY AND MARGINALIZE COMMUNITIES I CAN TELL YOU IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS I'VE BEEN GETTING OUT I AM ONLY JUST NOW ABLE TO TELL YOU THAT. SO ON AVERAGE WE KNOW THAT MOST OF OUR CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE WILL BE ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. BEFORE WE ARE EVEN ABLE TO REMEMBER THE TRAUMA IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER WITH ENOUGH DETAIL FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE ANYTHING. SO WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ALSO WITHIN THE CONTEXT. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES IT'S 35% HIGHER AMONG MY MOTHER TINA'S COMMUNITIES IS 22% HIGHER IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY FOR WOMEN OF COLOR AND COMMUNITY. IT IS 48% AND 57% TRANSAMERICA. WE ACCESS SYSTEMS WE WILL NOT CALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT WE WILL NOT GO TO THE DA I OUTED MYSELF TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO THE DA'S OFFICE AND GOT NO SUPPORT WHICH IS WHY MY AGENCY NOW IS DIRECTING SERVICES TO THIS COMMUNITY IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME. TO REMEMBER ITTHAT WE WANT TO REMEMBER IT FOR THAT WE CAN EVER SPEAK IN PUBLIC THANK YOU. WE ARE MOTION ON THE UNIT DID SORRY SENATOR WE ARE POLITICS OKAY. SO WE HAVE A MOTION -- AS AMENDED AND CENTER RUBIO I'D BE PLEASED TO BE ADDED A SICK THANK YOU -- BROKEN -- I'M SORRY. TO RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT WHAT WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TODAY -- AS I MENTIONED TODAY THIS IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME BUT YOU KNOW I I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND TO KNOW YOUR INTENT HERE BUT AS I HEARD SOME OF THE COMMENTS RIGHT NOW I HEARD AND AND 30% OF CASES WERE NOT PROSECUTED. I ALSO HEARD EARLIER IN A LETTER THAT THEY SENT OF OPPOSITION THAT -- PLEASE ENTER YOU FAILED TO RESPOND TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTS AND SO TO THAT I SAY THAT CLEARLY THE SYSTEM IS FLAWED AND DESIGNED. TO PROTECT THE ABUSER NOT THE VICTIM. AND DOM AND I HOPE THAT DIE SOME DAY WE'LL GET TO THE TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. TO TALK ABOUT IT AND AND PUBLIC AND SO I WANT TO THANK RETOOL IN WOODS AND THE OTHER VICTIMS SURVIVORS. THAT HAVE JOIN ME HERE TODAY BECAUSE IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS. SO WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR NOW DO ROLL CALL MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI SKINNER I'M MORE LIFE. BRADFORD AYE BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. MITCHELL AYE MITCHELL AYE MORALE. WIENER WIENER AYE. BILLS ON CALL. BUT WE WILL -- CONTINUE THAT VOTE ONCE PEOPLE RETURNED AND NOW I'LL BE PRESENTING. ON SB. FIVE SIXTEEN AND I WILL ASK SENATOR WIENER THANKS. ALL RIGHT. THANKS SO MUCH YES AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- SB FIVE SIXTEENTHS SO ARE COURTS KICK MANY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT JURIES ARE NOT BIASED IN THAT THEY DELIBERATE FAIRLY -- SB FIVE SIXTEENS PURPOSE IS TO ASSIST THAT OBJECTIVE. EVIDENCE OF A CRIME PRESENTED DURING TRIAL IS THE BASIS ON HOW JURIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DECIDE GUILT OR INNOCENCE. CURRENT LAW. GIVES THE COURT'S DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE IF IT CREATES UNDUE PREJUDICE CONFUSES THE ISSUES OR MISLEAD THE JURY. HOWEVER JUDGES RARELY ACT TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE PARTICULARLY GANG EVIDENCE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME CURT ITSELF WEIGHED IN STATING AND I QUOTE. GANG EVIDENCE EVEN AS IT RELATES TO THE DEFENDANT MAYBE SO EXTRAORDINARILY PREJUDICIAL AND IF SO LITTLE REVEL INSTIGATE ALT THAT IT THREATENS TO SWAY THE JURY TO CONVICT REGARDLESS OF THE DEFENDANTS ACTUAL GUILT. SO WHAT SB FIVE SIXTEEN DOES IS ADDRESSES THIS PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE BY REQUIRING A DEFENDANT TO BE CONVICTED OF THE UNDERLYING CRIME FIRST. BEFORE. THERE IS. EVIDENCE RELATED TO THEIR POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE GANG. AND THEN SECONDARILY THE JURY WOULD DETERMINE. IF THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF A GANG ENHANCEMENT OR GANG OFFENSE AND WITH ME. TO ADD TO THE SUPPORT IS DOCTOR MITCHELL EISEN WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT CSU LA. AND A PREVENT I CRUZ A PUBLIC DEFENDER. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS. HI MITCH EISEN PROCESS I COUNTY COUNCIL DELAY. MY PRIMARY AREA OF RESEARCH IS REALLY AN EYEWITNESS MEMORY BUT WHEN I STARTED -- WAS WORKING ON A LOT OF CASES IN WHICH I FOUND THAT THE EVIDENCE WAS REALLY WEAK. BUT YET THE PROSECUTORS USED THE DISCRETION OF BRINGING IN GANG TESTIMONY AND HAVING LENGTHY TESTIMONY FROM A GANG EXPERT TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE HEINOUS CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE GROUP. AND THEN FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE SECURING GUILTY VERDICTS AND I WAS SURPRISED IN THESE PARTICULAR CASES. NOW IN SOME CASES THE DEFENDANT WASN'T IN A METAGAME MEMBER. BUT IN OTHER CASES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A KID WITH A SINGLE F. I. KERR TO FIELD IDENTIFICATION CARD BECAUSE HE'S HANGING OUT WITH SOME. FRIENDS WHO GOT IN TROUBLE AND PLAYED BASKETBALL WITH THEM AND GOT STOPPED BY THE POLICE AT SOME POINT IN IN INDEED. THAT CARD LED TO HIM SUSPICION OF HIS CRIMINAL INVOLVEMENT IN OTHER CASES IT WAS FOLKSWHO'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS LIFE AND PULL THEIR LIVES TOGETHER. BUT THEY HAD A HISTORY OF BEING KNUCKLE HEADS WHEN THEY WERE KIDS AND GETTING INVOLVED IN TROUBLE. SO I WAS CONCERNED THAT PERHAPS THAT. ALTHOUGH THIS. THIS TESTIMONY WAS IN. TO SHOW MOTIVE IT HAD THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF BASICALLY INFERRING THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS ACTUALLY PARTICIPATING IN THE AXE BEING DESCRIBED BY THE GANG EXPERT WITH GANGS PARTICIPATING. SO WE DID SOME RESEARCH. AND IN OUR FIRST STUDY PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE SIMPLY HAD TO SIMULATE TRIAL VIDEOTAPE TRIAL THE FOLKS WATCH WHERE THERE WAS EITHER NO MENTION OF GANG. OR THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER SAID THE KID WAS HANGING OUT WITH GANG MEMBERS BEFORE THE CRIME OR IF THEY WERE SELF METAGAME MEMBER. AND INDEED IN THIS FIRST EXPERIMENT WE FOUND THAT JUST MENTIONING GANG LED TO INCREASE GUILTY VERDICTS. SO WE REDID IT. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH ANOTHER EXPERIMENT WHERE WE VIDEOTAPE THE TRIAL BUT THIS TIME WE ACTUALLY HAD GANG TESTIMONY IN THE AREA A GETTING US WHERE TO DOES IT FREQUENTLY FOR THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE DOING ITS PART OF THE TRIAL. CLEARLY REASONABLE THAT WAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED. AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT WHEN NO GAME WAS MENTIONED IN THIS TRIAL AFTER DELIBERATIONS THERE WERE ZERO GUILTY VERDICTS. HOWEVER WHEN THE GANG EXPERT AND THE GANG TEST WHEN HE WAS ADMITTED WE GOT 10% GUILTY. GUILTY VERDICTS AND WE ARE WANTING HOW'S THIS POSSIBLE SO WE RE DID IT AGAIN. AND THIS TIME WE MADE IT IT'S MORE SERIOUS CRIME. FIGHT OVER A GIRL THAT RESULT IN A SHOOTING AND A CHILD WAS KILLED WITH A STRAY BULLET. AND AGAIN. WE FOUND THE SAME THING WHEN THE GANG TESTIMONY WAS ADMITTED WE HAD 20% GUILTY VERDICTS AND WHEN NO GANG TESTIMONY WAS OMITTED. ONE PERSON OUT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AFTER DELIBERATIONS VOTED GUILTY. AND WE HAVE THIS ON FINDING AND WE FOUND THAT ACROSS THE STUDIES WHEN THE GANG EVIDENCE WAS ADMITTED. WE FOUND THAT DURING DELIBERATIONS PEOPLE WERE DISCUSSING THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THEY WANT TO VOTE GUILTY WAS EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENDANT'S PRIOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT. BUT NO SUCH EVIDENCE WAS EVER ADMITTED. WHEN WE ARE WANTING WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF THIS FALSE MEMORY SO WE DID ANOTHER COUPLE OF STUDIES MORE RECENTLY WHERE WE DID THE EXACT SAME PROCEDURES BUT AFTER DELIBERATIONS WE ASK THEM? ABOUT THEIR MEMORY FOR THE EVIDENCE AND WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED. DO YOU REMEMBER EVIDENCE BEING PRESENTED A PREVIOUS CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND DO YOU REMEMBER EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS. FOR SIMILAR CRIMES VERY PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE O TIGHTLY CONTROLLED BY THE COURT. AND INDEED WE FOUND THAT IN THE GANG CONDITION IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT THESE FALSE MEMORIES. NOW WHY. WELL BASICALLY THERE'S THE STRONG INFERENCE OF THE GANG TESTIMONY THAT IF THE GANG IS PARTICIPATING THESE CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND THIS PERSON IS A MEMBER OF THE GANG THEN THEY MUST BE. SO IT COULD BE JUST AN INFERENCE AND PEOPLE WERE JUST HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT AND IN MISTAKENLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE WHAT THE EVIDENCE WAS. HOWEVER THIS COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE OTHER FINDING OF WHY PEOPLE WOULD FALSELY RECALL HEARING EVIDENCE OF PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS FOR SIMILAR CRIMES. THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THIS WAS NEVER EVEN INFERRED IN THE TESTIMONY. ESSENTIALLY OUR PROPOSAL -- OUR THEORY ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REPEATED NOW FOR SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS. IS THAT. IT'S HARD TO ORGANIZE ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM A TRIAL. THE FACT IS YOU'RE ASKING PEOPE TO DO A LOT YOU'RE ASKING JURORS TO ORGANIZE HUGE AMOUNTS OF EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE IT WAS ONLY AN HOUR LONG TO SIMULATED TRIAL. AND TAPE MANY TRIALS LAST DAYS OR WEEKS. AND INDEED PEOPLE WILL CONFLATE SOME OF THE EVIDENCE OF THEIR HEARING. LEADING TO THESE MISTAKEN PROPOSITIONS SO WITH OUR DATA SENSUALLY SHOW IS IT NOT ONLY THIS IS THE INFERENCE OF THE GANG MEMBERSHIP. BIAS FOLKS AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH IS I THINK COMMONSENSE. BUT ALSO IT APPEARS TO AFFECT PEOPLE'S MEMORY FOR THE EVIDENCE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY START TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR HEARING. TESTIMONY EXPERT DESCRIBING THE PERSON AS COMMITTING CRIMINAL ACTS. EVEN HAVING CONVICTIONS FOR SIMILAR CRIMES. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M APRIL VANDYKE CAM OF DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY I'M SB FIVE SIXTEEN IT WILL FIX THESE ISSUES -- AS ILLUSTRATED BY DOCTOR EISEN'S RESEARCH -- SB FIVE SIXTEEN WILL RESTORE DUE PROCESS AND ENSURE A FAIR TRIAL PROCEDURES WHEN GANG ENHANCEMENTS AND OFFENSES ARE CHARGE. THIS BILL WOULD MERELY SEPARATE THE TWO I TWO SETS OF EVIDENCE ONE OF THE ACTUAL CHECK. CRIME THAT IS CHARGED THERE WILL BE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GUILTY OF THE ACTUAL. CRIME CHARGED BEFORE ANY EVIDENCE OF GANG AFFILIATION OR CONTACTS IS PRESENTED TO THE JURY. WE ALREADY HAVE PROCEDURES LIKE THIS IN COURT ROOMS TODAY. SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE WHO IS CHARGED WITH A PRIOR STRIKE CONVICTION COURTS REGULARLY BIFURCATE THIS EVIDENCE FIRST THEY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON IS CONVICTED. ARE GUILTY EXCUSE ME OF AT THE UNDERLYING OFFENSE AND THEN THE JURY IS TO DETERMINE THE PRIOR CONVICTION -- GANG EVIDENCE IS SO HIGHLY INFLAMMATORY AND PREJUDICIAL. EVEN UTTERING THE WORD GANG TO A JURY CREATES A BIAS IN THE MIND OF THE JURORS. FOR EXAMPLE IN A RECENT TRIAL -- THE GANG EXPERT TESTIFIED. THE COURT HAD TO TAKE A BREAK. BECAUSE THE A JUROR HAD A PANIC ATTACK. AND THIS EXPERT WHO TESTIFIED NOT TO ANY ACTS THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ON TRIAL HAD DONE. BUT TO ACTS OF OTHER PEOPLE HAD DONE YEARS AND YEARS PRIOR. EVEN ACTS OF THIS. OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAD COMMITTED ACTS WHEN THIS PERSON WAS A CHILD. I'M THIS EVIDENCE IS SO INCREDIBLY INFLAMMATORY THAT IT. IS A DETRIMENT TO DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS IN JURY TRIALS. IMAGINE. NOT ONLY. EVIDENCE OF THINGS THAT YOU HAD DONE IN YOUR PAST COMING INTO YOUR TRIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE GUILTY OF OFFENSE. BUT EVIDENCE OF WHAT SOMEBODY YOU MET POTENTIALLY ONE TIME HAD DONE EVEN AFTER YOU HAD INTERACTED WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL HEINOUS CRIMES THAT THE PROSECUTORS ARE USING -- TO MUDDY UP THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE IN IN AN INDIVIDUAL CASE THIS BILL WILL RESTORE DUE PROCESS IN THESE. CASES I'M AND THAT'S WHY I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASSES THROUGH. MY POLITICS -- IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL -- SUPPORT. KEEP FORGETTING I'M SHARING -- NOT. FOR ALL THE GOOD AFTERNOON.

THE MICROPHONE FOR THE YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND PUSH A BUTTON TO TURN THE MICROPHONE YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MY NAME IS RYAN COUSINS I SUPERVISE MAJOR CRIMES WITH THE YOLO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME. THERE'S THERE'S TWO ISSUES THAT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS WITH THE BILL -- WON THE IS HOW THE BILL AFFECTS EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE AND THEN TO IS. WHAT HERE -- IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN FROM SACRAMENTO TRAVELING -- FROM A BACHELOR PARTY THROUGH BAKERSFIELD A AT A PART OF BAKERSFIELD. IT WAS OVER RUN BY GANGS AND WHAT THIS GENTLEMAN DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT HE WAS WEARING AT SHIRT THAT WAS THE COLOR. OF A RIVAL. GANG SET IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD -- AND HE SIGHED CRIP MEMBER MEMBER NAMED TED BLACK MEN APPROACHED THE CAR IN WHICH SHE WAS SLEEPING MOTHER GASSING UP ON THE WAY BACK TO SACRAMENTO. SAID I SEE YOU. AND SHOT HIM AND KILLED HIM AND THEN SHOT SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE CAR BECAUSE HE WAS WEARING THE WRONG. SHADE OF BLUE IN THE WRONG PLACE. I RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNED BY THIS BILL BECAUSE GANG EVIDENCE IS INCENDIARY NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT WOULD BE A WRD I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE BUT IT'S ALSO HIGHLY RELEVANT IN THESE TRIALS IF THIS LAW WERE TO BEEN PASSED THAT DAY. THEN TED BLACKMUN'S ATTORNEY AND I KNOW MR EYES INSTANTLY WITH THIS CASE BECAUSE HE TESTIFIED IN THAT CASE -- MR BLACKMUN'S ATTORNEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAND THERE AND SAY LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. MY CLIENT DIDN'T HAVE ANY REASON TO SHOOT THIS PERSON HE HAS HE HAS NO MOTIVE. IS THE OLDEST AND ONE OF THE MOST POBATIVE TYPES OF EVIDENCE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS A GANG MEMBER THAT. THE VICTIM WAS WEARING THE RIVAL GANG MEMBERS COLOR AND THAT THEY WERE IN GANG TERRITORY. AND THE REASON WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE GANG CRIMES ARE SO SENSELESS IF THERE LOOKED AT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF REGULAR PEOPLE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO THEM. WHY WAS A FIRST GRADE PREGNANT SCHOOL TEACHER STABBED BY THREE GANG MEMBERS IN HER DRIVEWAY ON MARCH TWENTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR -- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT THEN IN THE GAME CONTEXT IT CAN. IT WOULD BE LIKE IN A MURDER CASE WHERE A HUSBAND IS ACCUSED OF KILLING THEIR WIFE. KEEPING OUT THE FACT THAT THE HUSBAND MAY HAVE TAKEN ON A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY A WEEK PRIOR AS EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE THE BE LIKE KEEPING UP THAT TYPE OF EVIDENCE. POWERFUL EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE. AND THE THING THAT'S MOST I THINK DANGEROUS ABOUT THIS IS AS DOCTOR RISING ALLUDED TO THERE'S DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EVIDENCE. SO TAKING THE POWER AWAY FROM THE JUDGE TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THINGS COULD OR COULDN'T COME AND JUST LEAVES ONE ANSWER TO EVERY GAME CASE IT COMES OUT. EVEN I IT COULD BE VERY PROBATIVE AND NOT OVERLY PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE SOMETIMES THE LINE BETWEEN PREJUDICE AND RELEVANCE IS SO CLOSE. THE COMING UP WITH JUST ONE ANSWER WHICH IS EXCLUSION IS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE RIGHT ANSWER. THE SECOND POINT REGARDING BLOODIER AND I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS AND THERE IS THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY ON THIS REGARDING A JUROR'S. I'M. IF WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OF WHAT YOU'RE ASSUMING THE TRIAL GETS DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES IF WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WATER DEAR THE JURY. DURING PHASE ONE OF THE CASE AND THESE ARE GOING TO BE VERY SERIOUS CRIMES. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR A WORD ABOUT GANG. WHEN YOU COULD HAVE? PREVIOUS VICTIMS OF GANG CRIME SITTING ON THE JURY YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS OF BIASES FOR THE EXACT REASON THE EARLIER TESTIMONY STATED. GANG EVIDENCE CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE WHICH MEANS YOU BE PICKING JURIES FOR TRIED FOR CRIMES AND TRIALS THAT COULD LAST MONTHS. HAVING NO IDEA THAT THERE SOMEBODY HARBORING DEEP BIAS AGAINST GANGS OR FOR GANGS SITTING IN THE JURY IS GOING TO RESULT IN A MISTRIAL. IT'S GOING TO RESULT IN A HUGE WASTE OF TAXPAYER TIME AND DOLLARS DOING TRIALS FOR MONTHS ONLY TO HAVE JURORS BE TOLD AT THE BEGINNING OF PHASE TWO DO YOU LIKE DOING A DEATH PENALTY CASE. AND NOT TELLING THE JURY THAT THE CASE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH PENALTY UNTIL THE PNISHMENT PHASE IT WILL RESULT IN A MISTRIAL. SO I I THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID REGARDING GANG ENHANCEMENTS I THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A DIFFERENT APPROACH IS MADE THEY CAN ADDRESS THE GANG ISSUES. BUT COMING UP WITH JUST A ONE SIZE FITS ALL THE GANG EVIDENCE GETS EXCLUDED I'D I'D RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT WILL RESULT IN A HIDING FROM THE TRUTH FROM THE JURY. AND WILL HEAL SOME BAD RESULTS. THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME OUT OFFICE [inaudible] BACK -- THE ISSUE OF WHAT. MAKES. SORRY I'M IN A ALLOW -- MY A PUBLIC DEFENDER EXPERT -- TO TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY FIFTY EIGHT THE YOLO COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. I'M IN PARTICULAR CASES WE WE DECIDE. FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS THERE IS IN FACT A JURY INSTRUCTION THAT ADDRESSES MOTIVE I'M IT JUST SAYS THAT THE DA IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVE THE MOTIVE OF THE ACT. MANY TIMES THERE ARE CASES WHERE YOU CAN. WHY DID THIS HAPPEN WHO KNOWS BUT IF THEY? IF THE FAX. OF THE UNDERLYING CHARGER STRONG ENOUGH. THERE WILL BE A CONVICTION. SO BRINGING IN THE INFLAMMATORY GANG EVIDENCE. DOES NOT. MAKE. A CASE THAT IS PROVED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE CONVICTION. MY OTHER WITNESS WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING. NOT HE DIDN'T THE STATE. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE IS THE CAR BLUNTS DISCRETION OF THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE TO INTRODUCE THE GANG TESTIMONY THIS IS REALLY WHAT'S AT ISSUE SO -- WITHOUT ANY POLICING WITHOUT ANY JUDGMENT FROM THE COURT THEY THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BRING IN. WHAT WAS I THINK DESCRIBED ACCURATELY AS INCENDIARY? TESTIMONY -- AND THE AND THE SOME RESTRICTION ON THIS DISCRETION IS WOULD BE AWFUL USEFUL IN ACHIEVING -- DUE PROCESS. OKAY I THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR MITCHELL AND SENATOR BRADFORD OR VICE VERSA. THE QUESTION IS WAS THERE ANY VARIANCE IN YOUR MOCK TRIALS WHEN RACE WAS INJECTED LIKE A WHITE GANG MEMBER PURCHASE A BLACK OR BROWN GANG MEMBER IT WAS DURING VARIOUS THERE'S WELL. WE COULDN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF CHALCEDONIANS WHERE YOU'RE DOING THESE THINGS VERY LIBERAL YOUNG LATINA X. POPULATION WHERE. BY OUR BY OUR MEASUREMENTS ABOUT FAMILY THAT WERE INVOLVED IN GANGS IS A LIBERAL SAMPLE AS YOU CAN GET THEM WE ARE STILL GETTING THESE THESE VERDICTS -- BUT WE COULDN'T VERY RACE BECAUSE OF THE RESTRICTIONS WE ARE USING FULL DELIBERATIONS THESE THESE STUDIES TAKE YEARS TO DO. SO. OKAY ABSENT YOUR MOCK TRIALS IS YOUR ANY IOS TO PUBLIC DEFENDER IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE AND CONVICTION RATE FOR WHITE GANG MEMBERS ARE JUST WALKING AROUND. I'M IN MY COUNTY I HAVE NEVER -- EXPERIENCED IN MY PERSONAL USE OR IN HEARD OF OTHERS IN MY COUNTY WHO HAVE HAD A WHITE INDIVIDUAL CHARGED WITH THINKING CRIME -- I IN FACT REPRESENTED A WHITE MAN WHO WAS. EASILY VERIFIABLE AS A MOTORCYCLE GANG MEMBER AND HE WAS NOT CHARGED WITH THE GANG ENHANCEMENT. OKAY. I DO YOU WANNA. MAKE MEMBER OF THE RIVER. THANK YOU AND WITH RESPECT TO THE TWENTY FOR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER -- THAT WAS HALF OF THE JURY INSTRUCTION REGARDING MOTIVE. AS FAR AS SHOWING THE FDA DOES NOT HAVE TO PROVE MOTIVE BUT THAT INSTRUCTION ALSO SAYS THAT THE ABSENCE OF A MOTIVE CAN ALSO SHOW THAT THE PERSON DID NOT DO THE CRIME. AND AGAIN YOU WOULD BE HIDING FROM THE JURY AND WE WOULD ALLOW A DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO SAY THERE'S NO REASON WHY MY CLIENT WOULD DO SOMETHING CRAZY LIKE GOING TO A NEIGHBORHOOD IN. AND SHOULD UP NO MATTER WHAT THE EVIDENCE IS SIMILAR TO THE EVIDENCE I DESCRIBE FOR MISTER BLACK. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND ARMADILLO. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU FOR THE BILL -- SENATOR -- WHILE I HAVEN'T HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN COURT ROOM SETTINGS IT IT STILL STRIKES ME THAT -- PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WOULD HAVE. AND T. OF OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN -- A CRIME OR A CRIME SPREE WITHOUT USING THE TERM GANG AND BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY. NOT JUSTIFIED BUT BUT TO EXPLAIN A SERIES OF CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT USING THAT -- ONE PIVOTAL ROLE WORD THAT CREATES A A VISION AND IDEA CLEARLY -- AS EVIDENCED BY YOUR EXPERIENCE. I WAS JUST STRUCK BY THE LINE THAT THE OPPOSITION STATED THAT THE LINE BETWEEN PREJUDICE AND RELEVANCE IS SO CLOSE. AND IF THAT IS INDEED THE CASE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD -- ERR ON THE SIDE OF AVOIDING -- ANY PRESENT PREJUDICIAL ACTIONS AT ALL COSTS AND SO WE HAVE TO TILT AS FAR TOWARD RELATIVELY POSSIBLY CAN -- AND WITH THAT I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO SUPPORT THE BILL. OKAY ROOM MOTION BY SENATOR MITCHELL AND I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. IS THAT YOUR CLOTHES YES OKAY. WE HAVE A MOTION AND WE HAVE A VERY BRIEF CLOSE -- AND WILL CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL HI MITCHELL ARMERO WIENER RIGHT WIENER HIGH. WE'LL PUT THAT ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. AND BELIEVE SIX WILL HAVE THE GAVEL BACK TO THE CHAIR WE HAVE -- SENATOR GALGIANI HERE YOU MAY PROCEED CENTER GALGIANI IN THIS IS ITEM FOURTEEN SP. FOUR FIFTY NINE AS FOR FIFTY NINE ADDS CONSISTENCY TO THE PENAL CODE BY APPLYING THE EXISTING FIVE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. FOR THE INFLICTION OF GREAT BODILY INJURY DURING A RATE TO EARN -- SPOUSAL RAPE I ALSO WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON CONVICTED OF RAPING SOMEONE WHO ISN'T THEIR SPOUSE IS GIVEN A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT. WHEN THE SURVIVOR HAS SUFFERED GREAT BODILY INJURY UNDER ONE FORCE VIOLENCE ARRESTS OR MENACE? TO INTOXICATION OR UNDER ANESTHETIC OR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND THREE UNDER THE THREAT OF RETALIATION. SIMILARLY A PERSON CONVICTED OF RAPING SOMEONE WHO IS THEIR SPOUSE IS GIVEN THE SAME FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT ONLY WHEN THE SURVIVOR. HAS SUFFERED GREAT BODILY INJURY AFTER ONE FORCE VIOLENCE DRESSER MINUTES OR TWO UNDER THREAT OF RETALIATION. BUT NO FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT EXISTS IF THE SURVIVOR SUFFERED GREAT BODILY INJURY AT THE HANDS OF A SPOUSE. WHILE UNDE INTOXICATION OR UNDER ANESTHETIC OR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. SB FOUR FIFTY NINE WOULD FIX THIS INCONSISTENCY. I UNDERSTAND THEIR SHARED CONCERNS REGARDING PRISON OVERCROWDING IN ADDING MORE SINCE ENHANCEMENTS. HOWEVER WE SHOULD NOT BE TELLING VICTIMS THAT THEIR RAPE IS NOT AS SERIOUS AS OTHERS BY GIVING THE PERPETRATORS LAST TIME. AS SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED THE SAME ACT IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU IS THERE -- ANY WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. ALL RIGHT ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. ONE OF OUR E. ZERO CIRCUMSTANCES OKAY SO. YOUR YOU'RE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS THAT YES YES THANKS SO MUCH -- I IN NERO'S THE BILL SOME BUT I THINK IT STILL SERVES THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH YOU WERE INTENDED.

I AT INTERFERE INTERPRETATIONS IN OF LANGUAGE OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS CAN VERY AND IT COULD BE THAT ARE READ IS IS. TIME. WHATEVER IS THAT. THE ASSOCIATION'S READ IS MORE ACCURATE AND THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS OF A BILL MOVING THROUGH THERE WILL BE OTHER -- THE OTHER ALL EYES ON IT AND YOUR EXPRESSION OF WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE ASSOCIATION CAN -- HELP US IF THERE IS A PROBLEM.

POSSIBILITY OF LOSING SOME OF HIS WITNESSES WHICH WE WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. SINCE THEY PRIDE BEEN HERE ALL DAY. SO WE'LL GO TO SB FORTY AND THEN WE STILL HAVE -- ON THE DOCKET -- UNTIL BY. ENTER STONE A BILL BY SENATOR GLACIER A BILL BY SENATOR JONES AND THEN A COUPLE BY SENATOR WIENER BUT IF THERE ARE AUTHORS IN THE ROOM SENATOR WINNER WHEN YOU. THIS WILL GO TO THEIR ALL RIGHT. BUT YOU MAY PROCEED ON SB FORTY SIX OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR HELP ON THE AMENDMENTS -- TO THIS BILL AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. I SENATE BILL FORTY IS -- AN EFFORT TO ENSURE. THAT THE HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP PILOT PROGRAM. THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR CAN BE IMPLEMENTED -- IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LITERALLY. DYING ON OUR STREETS. THE BILL MAKES IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS. ARE TO THE HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP PROGRAM TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND TO ENSURE A STRONG I DO PROCESS PROTECTIONS AROUND THE ON IT SO IT'S CLEAR STANDARDS FOR INITIATING A CONSERVATORSHIP FOR RENEWING THE CONSERVATORSHIP -- AND FOR TERMINATING THE CONSERVATORSHIP. RECENT AMENDMENTS REQUIRE -- NOTIFYING POTENTIAL CONSERVATIVES -- AT THEIR SEVEN SEVEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. BUT THEY WILL BE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AFTER IN A FIFTY ONE FIFTY BECAUSE THE BILL ONLY APPLIES IF SOMEONE HAS BEEN. FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT TIMES I IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE BILL REQUIRES PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TO MAKE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO EMPLOY VOLUNTARY SERVICES -- TO HELP A CONSERVATIVE E.. OF LONG BEFORE -- THAT E.. FIFTY ONE FIFTY BECAUSE VOLUNTARY SERVICES ARE OF COURSE ALWAYS THE PREFERRED ROUTE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T WORK FOR EVERYONE. I THE AMENDMENTS ALSO -- CREATE THE OPTION FOR COUNTY TO PURSUE. A TWENTY THE TWENTY EIGHT DAY TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP. I AFTER THE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SO COUNTY WILL BE OPTION INSTEAD OF GOING RIGHT TO THE LONGER CONSERVATORSHIP. I TO START WITH A TWENTY EIGHT THE CONSERVATORSHIP. ARE WHICH COULD BE A BETTER OPTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. I SB FORTY ALSO CLARIFIES THAT. THE LEGAL PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING THE USE OF ASSISTANCE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT -- I TO ENSURE A DIET A. O. T. I HAS TO BE EMPLOYED FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT IS MEDICALLY. APPROPRIATE AND THAT WE'RE NOT FORCING OUR COUNTIES TO SEEK A O. T.. OFFER PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT IS MEDICALLY. INAPPROPRIATE. AND THEN THE RECENT AMENDMENTS ALSO REQUIRE THE CONSERVATIVES OFFICE TO SUBMIT A STATUS REPORT OF EACH CONSERVATIVE THE TO THE CORE EVERY SIXTY DAYS -- SO THERE IS -- A REGULAR CHECK AND AND THE POTENTIAL TERMINATE THE CONSERVATORSHIP NO LONG -- PROGRAM. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM. WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THE CURRENT CONSERVATORSHIP LAWS. PRE SB TEN FORTY FIVE FREE WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR ARE NOT WORKING. FOR A SMALL SUBSET OF OUR POPULATION WHO WERE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL SEVERELY DRUG ADDICTED DYING ON OUR STREETS INCAPABLE. OF ACCEPTING VOLUNTARY SERVICES. WE ALL SUPPORT VOLUNTARY SERVICES BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING THEM I AND IT IS NOT PROGRESSIVE OR COMPASSIONATE OR HUMANE -- TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO DIE ON OUR STREETS WHEN YOU TO HELP PEOPLE. GET THEM HEALTHY GIVEN THE HOUSING THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. SB TEN FORTY FIVE FROM LAST YEAR CAN WORK -- SO -- WITH ME -- TODAY -- OR DR GRANT COLFAX WHO IS THE NEWLY APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND CAPTAIN SIMON PAYING FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE RESPONDING. TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CRISIS ON OUR STREETS. THANK YOU YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU I'VE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR SKINNER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DR GRANT COLFAX DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND ON BEHALF OF MERE BREED AND THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I THANK YOU ALL FOR HEARING THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SCOTT WEINER FOR HIS CONTINUED SUPPORT. AND LEADERSHIP IN CALLING ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS YOU KNOW WELL WE HAVE A HOMELESS CRISIS ON OUR STREETS. WE ALSO HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN A SUDDEN SHE'S CRISIS ON OUR STREETS AND ACROSS OUR STATE. AND OUR COUNTRY. AND THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM A COMBINATION OF HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD IN NO SB TENT FORTY FIVE WHICH WAS SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR. CREATES AN OPTIONAL DO CONSERVATORSHIP TO SERVE OUR MOST ACTORS RESIDENTS THOSE EXPERIENCING THE COMBINED IN HEAVY WEIGHT. OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING JUST ONE OF THESE ISSUES IT IS CHALLENGING TO HELP THEM BUT THE COMBINATION OF ALL THREE PRESENTS UNIQUE COMPLICATED CHALLENGES. THE REALITY IS A SAD REPEATING CYCLE WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREET. IN AND OUT OF THE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND IN SOME CASES. AND IN MANY CASES BEING SENT TO JAIL OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS IS DAMAGING TO THEIR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND OVERALL WELL BEING. THIS IS AN ISSUE WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH EVERY DAY TO ADDRESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO HELP BUT OUR CURRENT TOOLS ARE INADEQUATE. THE STATUS QUO DOES NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF EITHER THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE COMMUNITY IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF PLAY. IT ALLOWS PEOPLE'S CONDITIONS TO DETERIORATE AND THE PLACE IS A TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL STRAIN ON CITY RESOURCES. SB FORTY HELPS ADDRESS A CRITICAL NEED IN SAN FRANCISCO. BECAUSE IT OFFERS US A WAY TO HELP SOME OF THOSE MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. IN THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS AS WE STARTED TO PREPARE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW AREAS OF THAT BILL THAT NEED SOME MODIFICATION TO ENSURE WE CAN SERVE THE POPULATION THAT WE INTENDED TO SERVE UNDER. TEN FORTY FIVE SB FORTY VERY IMPORTANTLY INCLUDES THOSE MODIFICATIONS SB FORTY DOES NOT EXPAND THE POPULATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP IN SAN FRANCISCO. THAT NUMBER WOULD REMAIN BETWEEN FIFTY AND SEVENTY FIVE RATHER. THIS BILL REINFORCES THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF TEN FORTY FIVE THERE'S A QUOTE POPULATION OF INDIVISIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO WE CAN'T HELP TODAY. WE WANT TO HELP THROUGH A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP AND SB FORTY WILL ENSURE THAT WE REACH THEM. AS DRAFTED TODAY. TEN FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW US TO HELP FEWER THAN FIVE INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO THE FIFTY OR SEVENTY FIVE SB FORTY WOULD ALLOW US TO REACH. OUR CITY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE AND NEITHER I NOR MERE PRE TAKE LIGHTLY THE IDEA OF LIMITING ANYONE CIVIL LIBERTIES. WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAY IT IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION. BUT WHAT PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT HELP AND THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT THEY DIE ON OUR STREETS OR GO TO JAIL IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO STEP IN. WE MUST NOT TURN OUR BACKS ON THOSE IN NEED. I AM HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE BY PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED SERVICES TO OUR HARDEST REACH POPULATIONS. ON AND ON A PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL NOTE AS AN INTERN IN RESIDENT AT WHAT IS NOW SOCCER BURKE SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. THERE WAS LITTLE WE COULD DO FOR PEOPLE ON THE STREET SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. NOW WE HAVE SO MANY MORE TOOLS. AND THIS BILL WILL ALLOW US TO ACCESS THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX TO HELP THE PEOPLE MOST IN NEED. THIS BILL HELPS OUR SYSTEMS CATCH UP WITH THE SCIENCE. AND MOTHER IS THE LIVES OF ALSO WHAT AND WHETHER IT HELPS THE LIVES. OF THOSE WHAT AND WHETHER IT HELPS THE LIFE OF ONE SAN FRANCISCAN OR MANY IT IS MY DUTY AS DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO HELP. WITH THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT. WE LOOK FOR TO DOING JUST THAT I WANT TO THANK HER SKINNER SKINNER AND I WANT TO THINK THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATORS MY NAME IS SIMON BANG AND I WORK IN A SAN FRANCISCO FIRE DEPARTMENT UNIT THAT RESPONSE TO FREQUENT NINE ONE ONE USERS. SHEPHERDING PEOPLE TO SHELTER DETOX TREATMENT. MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- THOSE DEPENDENT ON NINE ONE ONE FOR THEIR DAILY SURVIVAL A SMALL NUMBER. OF THOSE THAT I KNOW I ESTIMATE SIX INDIVIDUALS. HAVE SUCH SEVERE SUBSTANCE USE THIS ORDER AND MENTAL DISORGANIZATION. THAT THEY CANNOT PERFORM ROUTINE ACTS OF DAILY LIVING. ONE MATH USER SITS IN HIS WHEELCHAIR AND EXCREMENT ALL DAY. SOMETIMES HE WILL TRY TO GET OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR TO DEFECATE IN THE OPEN. FIRST RESPONDERS FIND HIM COVERED IN FECES. UNABLE TO PULL UP HIS PANTS AND GET BACK IN HIS WHEELCHAIR. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL USE UNTIL THEY ARE INCOME PATH INCAPACITATED STUMBLE OUT OF AN E. R. SOON AS THEY CAN WALK OR ROLL OUT IN A WHEELCHAIR AND YOU SOME MORE. ONE PERSON ACTIVATED NINE ONE ONE OVER TWO HUNDRED TIMES LAST YEAR. WHILE IT IS TRUE THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT QUALITY SERVICES FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT HOMES IN SAN FRANCISCO. FOR THE POPULATION PRIORITIZE BY THIS LAW. THE SERVICE IS OFFERED. WE CASE CONFERENCE WITH CLINICAL PROVIDERS AND OFFER SHELTER. EMERGENCY HOUSING WITH SUPPORTIVE CARE. FOOD. THERAPY DRUG TREATMENT. IT IS CONTINUOUSLY REFUSED. ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS FIFTEEN TIMES SINCE JANUARY. YET HE INSISTS ON LEAVING SO HE CAN USE METH AND HEROIN. WE ARE TOLD THAT THEY CAN'T KEEP HIM AGAINST HIS WILL. HE HAS BEEN RELEASED AND RE ADMITTED THE VERY SAME DAY. ADMITTED JANUARY SECOND TO RELEASED JANUARY SECOND ADMITTED JANUARY THIRD RELEASE JANUARY SEVENTH. ADMITTED AGAIN ON JANUARY SEVENTH RELEASE JANUARY EIGHTH ADMITTED JANUARY NINTH. YOU GET THE PICTURE. HOW ARE WE ALLOWING THIS WRETCHEDNESS TO CONTINUE THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA OVER IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE AND WE THINK SENATOR WIENER FOR HIS CONTINUED WORK ON THIS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHELLE WRASSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITE. WHERE THEY HAVE? TO AT THE DESK THANK YOU. WE MAY HAVE YOU BACK IF THERE'S QUESTIONS. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- WE WON'T RELITIGATE TO THE COURSE OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE CERTAINLY AS THAT PASSED THE THIS -- LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR HOWEVER A CRITICAL PART OF SB TEN FORTY FIVE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND AS IT WORKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WAS THE PROVISION. THAT BEFORE USING THE CONSERVATORSHIP THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL THERE HAD TO BE AN OFFER OF A T. IN THE FIRST. PLACE THAT'S WHAT SB FORTY NOW DOES. IT REMOVES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE VOLUNTARY THE OFFER A VOLUNTARY SERVICES. AND ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS -- IS NOT NECESSARILY AVAILABLE -- UNDER THIS BILL WHICH I THINK IT WAS THE INTENT WAS TO ACTUALLY AND DO -- THAT PROVISION SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE -- LOOKED AT THE NOW THE FACT THAT WITH THAT OUT THE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHICH I THINK WERE SIGNIFICANT AND WE SUPPORTED AS THOSE -- WERE MADE IN THE BILL HOWEVER LEFT. TO A VERY IMPORTANT PROVISION -- AND FLAW WE THINK IN THAT IN THAT WAS THEN IT SINCE THERE WAS NO LONGER A MATTER OF RIGHT FOR THE REFERRAL FOR A T. SERVICES. THERE WAS NOW THERE IS NOW IN THAT PLACE TO READ THE ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND IS ESSENTIALLY A BUREAUCRAT MAKING THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER A OR T. WOULD BE APPROPRIATE OR NOT. NOW IF I DID HEAR SOME AMENDMENTS I HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE AMENDMENTS YET BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE THAT THOSE WERE ADDRESSING -- THAT PROVISION AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL -- TO TO THE BILL -- I JUST WANNA KNOW ONE OTHER PIECE THAT WE THINK IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IF YOU READ THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO -- THEY DETAILED THE IN ONE REPORT WOULD ESSENTIALLY WAS DESCRIBED AS A BROKEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IN IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND THE LOSS OF THE LICENSED RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES SO SIGNIFICANTLY -- AND SO WHAT WE AND THEY NOTED THE FACT THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE -- CONSERVATORSHIP COMING INTO THE SYSTEM YET WE'RE IN A SYSTEM THAT CAN'T SUPPORT -- THESE ADDITIONAL CONSERVATORSHIP SO FOR THAT REASON WE WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL [inaudible] THERE. ENTER MEMBERS MICHELLE CAPITA WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL -- ARE WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE UTHOR -- AND THE SPONSORS ALL ALONG LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AND BECAUSE WE REPRESENT PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATIVES WE REPRESENT FRONTLINE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS WHO STRADDLE BOTH THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE S. U. D. SIDES OF THE EQUATION. AND OUR MEMBERS HAVE. A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH THESE POPULATIONS THEY KNOW WHAT WORKS AND WHAT HASN'T THEY HAVE CONSERVE PEOPLE THEY'VE SEEN WILL COME IN THE DOORS OF CONSERVATORSHIP -- GET BETTER AT TIMES THEY'VE ALSO NOTED TO US IN PART OF THE REASON FOR OPPOSITION HAS BEEN THAT WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS -- IT IS VERY HARD TO IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPEL. TREATMENT FORCE TREATMENT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT READY FOR RECOVERY. LOCKED BEDS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS DO NOT EXIST -- AND SO WHEN WE STEPPED DOWN IT IS OFTEN THE CASE SOMEONE HAS NOT CLEARED UP ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE. AND WE INTRODUCE THEM TO SUBSTANCE USE RECOVERY SERVICES -- IF THEY'RE NOT READY THEY WILL LEAVE THOSE FOR A STEP DOWN FACILITIES AND SO. WHAT WE ARE EMBARKING ON HERE BY CREATING A NEW CONSERVATORSHIP THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT A COAL OCCURRING -- POPULATION WITH BOTH A CD AND MENTAL ILLNESS IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPERIMENTING WITH WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE TO TARGET A CONSERVATORSHIP THAT HAS AS ITS BASIS BOTH CONDITIONS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO STUDY THIS QUESTION SO ONE OF OUR REQUESTED AMENDMENTS IS FOR A THOROUGH EVALUATION TO SEE WHAT ARE THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THIS POPULATION WHILE THEY'RE IN THIS CONSERVATORSHIP. HOW DO THEY FAIR IN THE END -- BUT WE KNOW THAT COMPULSORY DRUG TREATMENT IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD HAVE HAD OFTEN SOME NEGATIVE WERE NOT READY. TO GET CLEAN -- THEY OFTEN GO RIGHT BACK TO USING AND ARE UP TO FORTY TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF RELEASE -- THAT IS SIGNIFICANT WE KNOW THAT -- FOR MATHEMATICS THEIR PSYCHOSIS CAN GET. DEEPENED AND SO I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO SEE IS HOW DO PEOPLE FARE AND WHAT ARE THEY GETTING WHEN THEY'RE IN THIS SPECIAL KIND OF CONSERVATORSHIP THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE ALSO BELIEVE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FRONT LOAD. ACCESS TO THOSE VOLUNTARY SERVICES OUR MEMBERS SAY THAT WHEN WE OFFER WHEN WE PROVIDE WE REALLY ENGAGE FOLKS AND DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP OVER TIME. TO GET THEM INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICES FOLKS ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WILLING TO DO TO AVAIL THEMSELVES BUT IT TAKES TIME. IT'S NOT A QUICK FIX AND IT'S ALSO NOT A SILVER BULLET MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS AND EVEN WITH CONSERVATORSHIP WILL BE BACK -- IT'S JUST THAT HARD THAT IS THE NATURE OF RECOVERY AND SO WE URGE YOU TO WORK WITH US. AND YOU HAVE HER TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS POLICY AND REALLY TO LEARN FROM IT TO SEE OVER TIME IF THIS REALLY IS A GOOD SOLUTION FOR THIS POPULATION THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AS A LAWYER WHO WORK. A NUMBER OF YEARS ON MENTAL HEALTH CALENDARS AND ON THE CONSERVATORSHIP CALENDARS -- AND WITH GREAT RESPECT TO THE SENATOR IN THE COMMITTEE -- I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS WRONG TO USE CONSERVATORSHIP SAYS IN THE ANSWER TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS. SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THIS BILL SUGGEST THAT DEPRIVING PEOPLE OF THEIR LIBERTY BY WAY OF CONSERVATORSHIP ISN'T APPROACH WE SHOULD TAKE. IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE HOPELESSNESS OF THE LACK OF HOUSING FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS PEOPLE NOR DOES IT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE ADDITIONAL NEED. OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT INVOLUNTARY IN A CON CONSERVATORSHIP. OR SERVANTS OF USE TREATMENT. UNDER GOVERNOR REAGAN THE STATE HOSPITALS WERE ESSENTIALLY EMPTY AND PERSONS WERE SENT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES FOR TREATMENT AND CARE. THIS IS BOTH GOOD AND BAD IT WAS GOOD IN THAT IT MITIGATED THE OVER USE -- OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE ABUSE WITHIN THE MIDDLES HOSPITALS. THE BAND IS THAT THE MONEY FOR THE COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE THIS CARE HAS DIMINISHED WELL THE NEED HAS EXPLODED. BETWEEN THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FUNDING THE GROWING ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THE HOUSING CRISIS WE NOW HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS ON OUR HANDS. PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT ADDRESSED LIKE STAND EXPANDING CONSERVATORSHIP. I WOULD LIKE TO APPOINT ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THIS BILL. THIS IS -- MISDEMEANORS HELD IN IN LOCAL JAILS WHEN THEY ARE FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. THE LINE THE SITUATION AS IT DOES IN SB FORTY CALLS FOR THE LEAST RESPECT DESTRUCTIVE PLACEMENT. WHAT THAT MEANS -- IN MANY COUNTIES IS THEY SAID IN JAIL FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR TERM WAITING FOR A BED IN THE STATE HOSPITAL. THAT LIST THEY ARE ON LAST THEY SIT IN JAIL BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LESS RISK GIVE PLACEMENTS FOR THEM. DUE TO THE FAILURE FUNDING. BUT THE INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL FELONS THE STATE HAS CHOSEN TO TREAT THEM IN THE JAILS INSTEAD OF THE STATE HOSPITALS FOR THE LEAST RESTRICT STRICT OF STE. WE HAVE TURNED OUR COUNTY JAILS IN THE MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS. AND ISSUE WHICH MOST OF US HAVE BEEN AWARE OF FOR MANY YEARS. MENTAL HEALTH PLACEMENTS UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP CAN BE EVEN MORE LIMITING OF LIBERTY THEN THE JAILS CONSERVATORSHIP AN INVOLUNTARY CIVIL COMMITMENTS ARE POWERFUL TOOLS. USE OF THEM MUST BE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED. EXPANDING THEM WOULD ALWAYS GIVE IT SHOULD ALWAYS GIVE US PAUSE. SB FORTY TAKES AN UNTESTED NEW FORM OF CONSERVATORSHIP AND MODIFIES IT IN WAYS THAT ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. WELL WE FULLY SUPPORT ENDING HOMELESSNESS. DEALING WITH -- SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND BETTER TREATING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF WILL GOALS THE EXPANSION OF CONSERVATORSHIP ARE NOT AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE TO ACHIEVE THEM AND CPD A RESPECTFULLY URGES A NO VOTE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLER ON BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER AND ONLINE POVERTY IN OPPOSITION AS WELL. ENTER MEMBERS KEVIN BACK OF AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OR CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MINUTES [inaudible] MANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT -- COMMENT BY. THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE TAKEN. VERY AGREED TO TAKE IN OUR CLARIFYING THAT THE COURT MUST MAKE SUBSTANTIVE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE PERSON IS INELIGIBLE FOR OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM IT. AND ALSO SPECIFYING THE VOLUNTARY TREATMENT CAST HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT THE EARLIEST TIME POSSIBLE TO PREVENT WORSENING OF THE PERSON'S CONDITION SO IT THOSE ARE AMENDMENTS BETTER. THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN. I'M CENTER BRADFORD YES AS CO AUTHOR. GEN FORTY FIVE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND TH. THE NEED FOR THE VERSES TO PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE ALREADY HAD IN PLACE. SO THE DE THE REASON THAT WE INTRODUCED THIS BILL THERE THERE WERE SOME **** THE BILL OVER CLARIFICATIONS AND CLEAN UP AS OFTEN HAPPENS. AS YOU KNOW HIM WHEN LEGISLATION HAPPENS. BUT THE CORE OF A AND I HAVE TO SAY I JUST I HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH. AS I SAT UP AND LISTENED TO THE OPPOSITION IS ARE ALL GROUPS THAT I WORK WITH ALL THE TIME AND CARRY BILLS FOR A TIMES ETCETERA. ON I HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. ABOUT A BILL THAT IS NOT THIS BILL. I SO TO SAY THAT THIS BILL IS REMOVING THE AIR WITH. REQUIREMENT. IS TO IS JUST INACCURATE. TO THE WHAT HAPPENED WAS LAST YEAR AFTER THE BILL CAME OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. AND A MEMO WAS PUT IN AN AT AND AS WE ALL KNOW AND AND APPROPRIATIONS ONE OF ALL KINDS OF SUSPEND SOMETIMES AMENDMENTS. I MEAN THAT YOU ARE SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN THEY'RE BEING PUT INTO THE BILL AND YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE FEEDBACK ON AND MEMBER ONE IN THE BILL. SAYING THAT THAT YOU MUST SEE A T.. EVERYONE IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING THEM BEFORE YOU SEE SERVICE. AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT FOR SOME OF THESE PEOPLE A. O. T. IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AND WE WOULD DO THAT ANYWAY. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE. FOR WHOM A. O. T. IS MEDICALLY INAPPROPRIATE. AND SO WHAT THAT AMENDMENT DID WAS PUT. PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN A POSITION OF POTENTIALLY FILING FRIVOLOUS A. O. T. PETITION SEEKING AOTI FOR PEOPLE. FOR WHOM THEY KNOW IT'S MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE AND PROBABLY NEVER BEING ABLE TO GET THAT INTO A CONSERVATORSHIP. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS BILL IS NOT REMOVING THE A. O. T. -- PROVISION WERE SAYING THAT YOU TO HAVE TO DO A T. UNLESS THE SERVICES TO THE POSITION NOT A BUREAUCRAT. CERTIFIES THAT A WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PERSON AND THEN EVEN BEFORE THE AMENDMENT THIS COMMITTEE WHO. PUT IN SOMEONE COULD ALWAYS CHALLENGE OF FINDING IN COURT. I SAID THAT THAT'S THE MAIN THING AND I I'LL BE ON LAST YEAR AFTER THAT AMOUNT WENT IN. I TRIED TO GET PERMISSION TO MODIFY IT BUT AS AS YOU KNOW. A MODIFY AND APPROPRIATIONS AMENDMENT IS EXCEPTIONALLY HARD. AND SO WE WERE UNABLE TO DO IT. THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY. WE'RE HERE I'VE THE THE BILL WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO APPLY IN SAN FRANCISCO TO ABOUT FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE OR MAYBE A HUNDRED PEOPLE AT THE MOST. I AND WITH THAT A. O. T. AMENDMENT THAT WAS PUT IN LAST YEAR -- AS DOCTOR COLFAX SAID ON IN NOW PLACE TO AT MOST FIVE PEOPLE. BECAUSE IT TOOK OUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN NEED OF THIS [inaudible] CHAU. WHAT BEARING TO NUMBER FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS OUT WHEN THIS BILL? I'M SO IN ORDER TO BE I HAVE BASS LINE ELIGIBILITY. FOR FOR THIS FOR THE COUNTY SEAT CONSERVATORSHIP PETITION. YOU HAVE TO BE. FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT TIMES WITHIN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. AND YOU HAVE TO BE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH. CONDITION -- AND A SEVERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. DISORDER I AM AND THEN THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER REQUIREMENTS YOU HAVE TO BE OFFERED VOLUNTARY SERVICES YOU HAVE TO BE GIVEN NOTICE AFTER THE SEVEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY THERE ARE MORE -- AND ALL THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS OF CONSERVATORSHIP. YOU GET A JUDGE YOU CAN DEMAND TRIAL BY JURY YOU GET AN ATTORNEY IN SEVERAL OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST TO THE OFFICES IN THE COUNTRY. AND OUR IT AND WE ACTUALLY SHORTEN IT FROM A YEAR SIX MONTHS -- AND THEN YOU OFFER THE OPTION OF TWENTY EIGHT DAYS INSTEAD OF SIX MONTHS INSTEAD OF THE FULL SIX MONTHS -- AND YOU HAVE TO DO REPORT EVERY SIXTY DAYS AND IF WE TERMINATED EARLY TO THERE ARE ENORMOUS GUARD RAILS -- AROUND. AND I'M SURE PERSONALLY THE REASON I SUPPORT BILL LAST YEAR IS ON THE SON OF THE PSYCH NURSE WHO CONSULTED BUT I DID NOT CONSULT YOUR ON THIS MEASURE BUT SHE CLEARLY. HAS STATED MY MOTHER'S STATED THAT MANY TIMES FIFTY ONE FIFTIES ARTISTS HOLDS FOR PEOPLE WHO. MIGHT HAVE SEVERE DRUG PROBLEMS AND ONLY COUNTY THEY WERE JUST KIND OF LIKE. HOLDING FOLKS JUST BE OLD UNTIL THEY SOBERED UP SOULS SAY THAT'S THE CASE OF SOMEONE WHO. JUST AS ON A DRUNKEN BINGE AND YOU'VE BEEN HELD EIGHT MONTHS ME EIGHT TIMES IN A YEAR BUT REALLY DON'T HAVE IT. A SEARCH OF YOUR DRUG PROBLEMS THAT'S WHAT. MY MOTHER'S FRUSTRATION WAS MOST THE TIME THEY WERE JUST HOLDING FOLKS SILLY SO WE'RE NOT BEFORE RELEASING BACK OUT WELL SO THE THE BILL ON HAVING EIGHT FIFTY ONE FIFTIES BY ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH. THAT'S JUST LIKE STEP -- ONE AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SEVERE SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS ORDER. HAVE A SEVERE. MENTAL ILLNESS I IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER THINGS SO JUST BEING FIFTY ONE FIFTY IT IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES YOU RAISE IS AN INTERESTING ONE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN IN THESE VERY. WHO WHO ARE AT PARTICULAR WHO ARE ADDICTED AND THE REASON WHY CURRENT LPS LAWS ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO READ SOME? IS THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE GET SAY. FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND THEN BY THE ENDS. DAY IN OF A DATE THERE'S NO BASIS TO HOLD THEM ANYMORE EVEN THOUGH AS YOU HEARD BEFORE. PICKED UP EVERY DAY WERE SLEEPING IN THEIR FECES WHO ARE YOU RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC YELLING AT CARS. AND WHO ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING VOLUNTARY SERVICES EVEN THOUGH WE OFFERED TO THEM -- AND AND THEY NEED HELP AND SO YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE. THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES BY THEMSELVES ARE NOT ENOUGH THESE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH A SEVERE THIS ORDER. AND EVEN THEN THEY GET A TRIAL TO GET A PUBLIC DEFENDER ETCETERA. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SO DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL [inaudible] THE BILL -- CENTER WINNER UNTIL IT CLOSED I THANK YOU I'M I'M I'M SURE I DO THIS ONE IS A NOTE ON AND YOU HEARD THIS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WHEN THE SENATE -- BUT WE DO HAVE WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY A CONSERVATORSHIP PROGRAM. TODAY IT'S A VERY ROBUST ONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S CALLED JAIL -- BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE EXTREMELY SICK CYCLE THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN. CONSTANT INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE WHICH IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO HAPPEN. AND THE AS I UNDERSTAND OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL IS THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER IN OUR COUNTRY WHICH IS. TERRIBLE I AND WE NEED ALTERNATIVE TO JAIL AND A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP. TURN OF TO HELP PEOPLE GET HEALTHY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL.

WHICH RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF VIOLENCE -- THE SUPREME COURT HAS CORRECTLY RECOGNIZE THAT -- TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO ASSAULT SEXUAL ABUSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- AND THAT READ DISREGARDING KNOWN RISKS -- TO TRANSGENDER. PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED CONSTITUTES DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE AND VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS SB ONE THIRTY TWO DOES A FEW THINGS. IT REQUIRES SAID DURING THE INITIAL INTAKE. MUST RECORD I THE INDIVIDUAL'S SELF REPORTED GENDER IDENTITY PREFERRED FIRST NAME PREFERRED PRONOUNS AND HONORIFICS AND THE PREFERRED GENDER IDENTITY OF AN OFFICER WHO WOULD CONDUCT ANY -- BODY SEARCH OF THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL. THE BILL REQUIRES THAT ALL STAFF AND CONTRACTORS OF CDC ARE CONSISTENTLY -- USE -- THE GENDER PRONOUN HONORIFIC AMBER FOR NAME SPECIFIED BY THE INDIVIDUAL. THE BILL REQUIRES CDC ARE TO HELD A TRANSGENDER PERSON AT A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- DESIGNATED FOR MEN OR WOMEN ACCORDING TO THE PERSON'S GENDER IDENTITY OR ALTERNATIVELY ACCORDING TO THEIR TO THEIR SEX ASSIGNED AT BIRTH IF THE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL BELIEVES THAT THAT IS THE SAFEST OPTION. IT WILL REQUIRE CDC ARE TO ASSIGN HOUSING PLACEMENT WITHIN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY -- ACCORDING TO A TRANSGENDER PERSON SAID SENSE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND IT DOES PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR CDC ARE IF IT HAS A SPECIFIC SECURITY -- CONCERNED THAT CAN EXPRESS AN ARTICULATE -- TO GRANT FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOUSING IN IN CONSISTENT WITH A PERSON'S GENDER IDENTITY. WE KNOW THAT ALMOST 40% OF TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS HAVE REPORTED EXPERIENCING SEXUAL VICTIMIZATION WHILE INCARCERATED COMPARED TO JUST 4% OF THE OVERALL INCARCERATED POPULATION. IN CALIFORNIA STUDY OF THE STATE'S PRISONS DESIGNATED FOR MEN FOUND THAT THE RATE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR TRANSGENDER WOMEN IN THOSE -- PRISON FOR MEN I WAS THIRTEEN TIMES HIGHER. THAN -- FOR CONFERRED THAN FOR MEN IN THE SAME PRESENCE. I TO HOUSE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AND FACILITIES THAT DO NOT CORRESPOND WITH THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. THESE INDIVIDUALS. OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND OTHER VICTIMIZATION. AND THEN THEY ARE TIMES ARE PLACE -- INTO ISOLATION QUOTE ON QUOTE FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN MIS CATEGORIZED AND THEY LOSE ACCESS TO SERVICES -- SP ONE THIRTY TWO WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT STOP ENSURING THAT WE ARE TREAT TREATING OUR TRANSGENDER -- INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITH BE A RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE -- I WILL NOTE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH CDC ARE AND I WANT TO PUBLICLY THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR COMMUNICATING WITH US AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET.

PRISONS BINARY GENDERED INSTITUTIONS BY DESIGN WHERE GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IS THE NORM. THE TRANSGENDER PEOPLE AT GRAVE RISK. SB ONE THIRTY TWO WOULD PUT.

ONE THIRTY TWO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- WHEN I STARTED THIS MY NAME IS BAMBI FESTIVAL AND I DO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE? TO LEAD A NATIONAL ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT IS PROVIDING LIFESAVING SUPPORTING SERVICES TO TRANCE INTERNET GOVERNMENT PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HERE. WITH YOU AND SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS GONE THROUGH THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM SOMEONE WHO HAS. THE OUT THERE WHO IS ONE OF THE CHOSEN FEW WHO HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFORM MY LIFE. INTERNET AROUND. OUT TO ADVOCATE FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OF TURN SIX BILLIONS. IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. I HAD TO SPEND ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE IN THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. STARTING IN COUNTY JAILS AND ULTIMATELY DOING FOUR DIFFERENT PRISON TERMS. I TO SPEND ALL THIS TIME IN PRISON BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND I THINK TRANS WOMEN I WAS PUSH TO ENGAGE IN THE STREET ECONOMY AS A WAY TO SURVIVE? WHICH LED ME TO THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. WHEN I WAS IN PRISON I WAS RAPED MULTIPLE TIMES BY OTHER INCARCERATED PEOPLE? I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO DO SEXUAL FAVORS TO OTHERS BECAUSE I DO. NINE FELL [inaudible] I A BECAUSE I ALSO A CONCERN FOR THE MY LIFE WAS CONCERNING DANGER. EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I WALK UP IN THOSE PRISONS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. IF I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHERE I A WEIRD. TO THE TIME OR WHAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN HOUSE WHEN I WAS CONVICTED TO THE TIME FOR THE CRIMES THAT I WEST CHARGE. FOR I WOULD HAVE SAID IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME FROM ALL THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES. THAT I SURVIVE WHILE I WAS IN PRISON. EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT I WENT TO PRISON I WAS NEVER ASKED H<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> WHY US. HOW I FELT? ABOUT WHO I AM. WIFE I WAS SCARE. NOT EVEN HOW IT WOULD BE FOR ME IF I WAS GOING TO BE SENT TO AN ALL MEN'S JAIL OR PRISON. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED TO ME SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM SEVEN I AM NOT. SUPPOSED TO BE WHO I AM. IT SEEMS I I WAS DOUBLE PUNISHED SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS A TRANS WOMAN. IF I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE MY HOUSING PLACEMENT THEN I CAN ALMOST ASSURE YOU. THAT ALL THOSE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES THAT I WENT THROUGH. AND SURVIVE -- FOURTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE. WE HAVE SAVE ME MUCH PAIN. TRAUMA IN MANY TEARS. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED TO ME. THIS IS A UNIT. EXPERIENCE FOR ME BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN TOO MANY TRANS WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED. ANOTHER ONE EXPERIENCE INSIDE IS SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN TO THE TRANS WOMEN IN PRISON. THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM. MUST VALIDATE AN HONOR OUR THAT OUR IDENTITIES. GIVING US DIGNITY AS HUMAN BEINGS. IN THIS FIVE AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONVICTED FOR A CRIME. AND WE DESERVE. RESPECT AND TO BE TREATED AS HUMAN BEINGS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY SENTENCE BY THE SYSTEM TO A LIFE SENTENCE OF PAIN. AND TRAUMA. NOT JUST THROUGH THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM OF THE ACTUAL SYSTEM HOW IT'S SET UP. WHEN WE GO TO PRISON AND WE WE ARE? WHEN WE HAVE? TO WHEN WE HAVE TO BE HOUSE WHERE. WE ARE CONTINUE HIS BEANS CARE AND OUR LIFE IS CONSTANTLY -- AND DANGER. IT'S NOT CONDUCIVE TO FOR US TO BE BETTER PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PRISON THE SEVER SPECS AGENCY AND DIGNITY AND IF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE WHERE WE CAN SERVE OUR TIME IN PRISON. IT WOULD HAVE SAVE OUR COMMUNITY SO MUCH PAIN. AND WE CAN FIND HEALING INSTEAD. THIS BILL PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A GREAT STATE TO SET PRECEDENCE TO SAY THE TRANS PEOPLE IN THIS STATE MATTER. AND IT IS A FORM OF REPARATION TO ALL THE PAIN AND TRAUMA THAT THIS STATE HAS CREATED IN THE TRANS COMMUNITY. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE TO SAY TO TRANS GENDER NON CONFORMING AND INTERSEX PEOPLE. THAT WE SEE YOU. AND WE VALUE AS THE HUMANE THING YOU ARE. THIS WOUND BILL WOULD DO JUST THAT. I URGE FOR YOU DOUBLE JEST ON SP. ONE THIRTY TWO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

HI AND THANK YOU -- TO THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US -- THIS BILL WILL IMPART LOOK FAMILIAR BECAUSE I WE HAD A CAL TELLS BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND I WANT TO THANK -- MY CO AUTHORS ON THIS BILL -- WHO ARE THE ENTIRETYOF THE DELEGATIONS? SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY MYSELF CENTER HILL. SOME MEMBERS CHIU TING MULLIN AND BERMAN -- WE ALSO HAVE UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR THE BILL -- FROM THE DALY CITY COUNCIL AND FROM SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- AND FROM THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND FROM THE SUPERVISOR AND SEVENTEEN COUNTY FOR THE DISTRICT SUPERVISOR. THIS BILL WILL DO TWO EIGHT IS A LONG STANDING ISSUE -- IN. THE SAN FRANCISCO CEMETERY COUNTY AREA AND DALY CITY -- OF THE CAL PALACE -- WHICH SITS ON SIXTY EIGHT ACRES OF LAND. A AND A LONG STANDING FRUSTRATION IN THE COMMUNITY ODDS CAL PALACE HAS NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE MOST PROMINENT -- AND WELL PUBLICIZED OF OF THOSE AREAS IN TERMS OF A LACK OF RESPONSIVENESS HAS BEEN THE CAL PALACES LONG TERM INSISTENCE ON HOLDING MULTIPLE GUN SHOWS A YEAR. AT THE COW PALACE AT THE STATE REQUESTS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR DECADES INCLUDING MANY UNANIMOUS VOTES FROM PRETTY MUCH EVERY GOVERNING BODY IN THE AREA. TO STOP THE GUN SHOWS AND DESPITE THOSE DECADES OF REQUEST THE CALIFORNICUM SHOWS. IN ADDITION -- FOR MANY YEARS -- DALY CITY HAS WANTED TO WORK WITH THE CAL PALACE TO ADDRESS LAND USE IN THE AREA IT'S ON SIXTY EIGHT ACRES THE BULK OF WHICH IS -- MAGGOT MASSIVE PARKING LOT. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES -- IN THE AREA AND DALY CITY HAS BEEN INTERESTED FOR A LONG TIME IN WORKING TO US BOTH TO SOME SORT OF DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING OR MIXED USE -- AND TO MAKE IT MORE OF A NEIGHBORHOOD AND SET UP -- OFTEN EMPTY. SPACE. AND THE CAL PALACE -- EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN -- DEVELOPMENT IS BEEN DISCUSSED OTHER THE QUESTION IS NEVER GONE ANYWHERE -- SO -- A NUMBER OF TIMES -- I AM NOW THE THIRD A SENATOR TO BRING A HAS BROUGHT BILLS IN THE CAL PALACE JACKIE SPEAR -- MARK LENO THE MYSELF ALL BOUGHT BROUGHT ALL INTRODUCED BILLS TO BAN GUN SHOWS. HELP HELLO AS THEY WERE ALL -- EITHER VETO OVER ONE DIED ON THE SENATE FLOOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND DISPLAY ALL OF THIS -- UNIVERSAL SUPPORT THE CALIPARI SICKLY IGNORED OBVIOUS REQUEST IGNORE THE BILL'S IGNORE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ONE THAT THE GUN SHOWS TO GO AWAY. AND KEPT ON GOING I THIS YEAR. WE INTRODUCED OF THE BILL IN A DIFFERENT FORM IT INCLUDES A GUN SHOW BAND IT ALSO INCLUDES -- AUTHORIZES AND DIRECTS TGS TO ENTER INTO NEGOTIATIONS WITH A NEW LOCALLY FORMED -- JOINT POWERS AGENCY -- TO CONSIDER BUT NOT REQUIRED THESE YES -- TO SELL THE LAND'S LOCAL AUTHORITY TO DECIDE THE FUTURE OF THE CAL PALACE. WE INTRODUCE THE BILL WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR WHO HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH I BELIEVE TO GUN SHOWS -- THAT OUR FORMER GOVERNOR A AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD THE CALIPARI'S CANCEL THE GUN SHOWS -- AND ANNOUNCED SAID IT WAS INTERESTED IN PURSUING DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES -- WHILE THOSE ARE BOTH OF COURSE GOOD THINGS AND YOU'LL HEAR THAT -- FROM THE OPPONENTS WILL THAT'S A REASON TO ABANDON THE BILL LOOK THEY JUST ANNOUNCED A WEEK OR TWO AGO THEY'RE CANCELING THE GUN SHOWS AND WANTED TO DEVELOPMENT. THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT YEARS AGO AND THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE DOING IT IS THEY KNOW THAT THEY NOW HAVE THIS BILL MOVING AND HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO MAY ACTUALLY SIGNED -- AND SO ALTHOUGH THESE ARE BOTH POSITIVE THINGS -- I THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE REMAINS THAT WE NEED HI THIS HUGE PIECE OF LAND AND THIS AGENCY TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. A WE WILL OF COURSE I CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS LOCALLY AND ALSO WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN WITH TGS AND WITH ALL RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS ON THE FUTURE OF THE CALIPARI RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB -- TWO EIGHTY ONE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE LET'S SEE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF DALY CITY.

THE AMENITIES THAT WE WOULD ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED AND PLUS SENATOR WHEN YOU'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR DALY CITY FOR DECADES TO TRY AND SERVICE THE BAYSHORE NEIGHBORHOOD AS IT DOES THE REST OF THE CITY SO IT CERTAINLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. FOR THIS THIS MAJOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR SKINNER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER WINNER FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND TIRELESS WORK ON THIS BILL. NOT ONLY DOES MARILYN BREED SPORTS BILL BUT ALSO OUR LOCAL SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND WHILE THE EXISTING BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS RECENTLY MADE THE DECISION TO END GUN SHOWS THAT COP POLICY -- THAT DECISION COULD BE REVERSED AT ANY TIME. AND SERVICES GO WOULD LIKE TO ENSURE THAT ANY ABOUT THE EVENT HELD THERE. WILL BE SCHEDULED WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY DESIRES -- AS CENTER WE ARE MENTION CALIFORNIA'S DEALING WITH -- AND PRESIDENT HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND SERVICE IS GOING THE REGION NEEDS TO CREATE MORE HOUSING ALL INCOME LEVELS FOR FAMILIES AND WORKING PEOPLE. IN THIS BILL DOES EXACTLY THAT. HOUSE AS AN INCREDIBLE HISTORY. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO FURTHER WHAT IS ALREADY A DEEP CONNECTION WITH THAT SITE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR FOR A LONG DAY FOR YOU ALL HI KATHY LYNCH REPRESENTING. NO IT'S NOT. KATHY LET'S REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTS IS COALITION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY SPARKLE OF INTERNATIONAL ACROSS OF THE WEST. STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THE SHOW HAS BEEN AT THE FACILITY FOR DECADES. WITH NO PROBLEMS THEY BRING IN A BURKE -- ALMOST A THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THE STATE. AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THIS IS A LEGAL REGULATED ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS OF THE AREA IN CALIFORNIA TEN THE SHOW'S SO TO SUGGEST THERE'S NO DEMAND IS A MISNOMER. THE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY POINTS OUT THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA PASSING LANDMARK GUN SHOW REGULATIONS THAT WE WORKED ON AND THE ACCORDING. TO TO STUDIES DONE BY UC DAVIS A WHICH THIS LEGISLATURE FUNDED TO DO GUN RELATED RESEARCH AT THE GUN SHOWS ARE VERY GOOD IN CALIFORNIA TO SUGGEST THAT ONE THOUSAND GUNS ARE SOLD IN A WEEKEND IT'S NOT CLOSE TO ACCURATE SINCE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL. REQUIRED FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS APPLY WE HAVE A WAITING PERIOD IN CALIFORNIA FOR A GUN TRANSACTION. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. TO LIMIT ACCESS TO PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFERS AS THAT WILL DRIVE AN UNDERGROUND MARKET LAW ENFORCEMENT SPOKE TO THIS IN THE PAST ON THIS ISSUE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE ARE PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT SHOULD BE ACCESS BY ALL CALIFORNIANS AND WATCHING THE SENATE GEOCHEMIST RING WAS DIFFICULT WATCHING THE VENUE FLASH. THE UPCOMING AGENDA TO BAN THE SHOW AND ASK AT THE SAME TIME FOR DEFEAT OF THE LEGISLATION THIS IS A SHAMEFUL ABUSE OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE OVER LEGAL ACTIVITY. THE DISMISSAL OF THE SHOW LAST WEEK AT THE BOARD MEETING WAS CAREFULLY WORDED BUT BE AWARE IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT LAWSUITS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL COURT UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. GUARANTEE OF FREE EXPRESSION THIS LEGISLATION REPRESENTS REAL DISCRIMINATION IMAGINE APPLYING THE STANDARD TO RENTAL AGREEMENTS AND HOUSING. WHILE THERE WILL THERE BE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THE PARTY'S BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST SUCH AS EVERYONE THAT GOES TO SHOWS THAT OWNS A FIRE ARM TO BE EXEMPTED FROM PAYING FOR THE TAXATION FOR THE STATE PROPERTY. SINCE THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED. THIS IS NOT A DISTRICT ISSUE THIS IS A STATE PROPERTY WITH STATE IMPACTS THERE IS REVENUE SHARING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE APPROVED FOR ALL THE D. A.'S SO THIS IMPACTS ALL THE DA'S. THIS IS A CRUEL LANDLORD THIS IS THERE IS ANOTHER BILL COMING YOUR WAY WITH THE BOARD SUSPENDED THE SHOW TO DO A STUDY AND IS NOW RUNNING A BILL TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THE LAWSUIT THEY FEEL THEY WILL LOSE. AND HAVE THE STATE TO ABSORB THE IMPACT YEAH WE'RE TOLD THE VENUE IS SPLASH IN IS DOING GREAT. AGAIN THERE IS REVENUE SHARING AND ITS IMPACT ARE FELT BY ALL THE DA FACILITIES IN CONCLUSION THIS BILL SEEMS TO AND THE AND THE RECENT ACTIVITY SEEM TO EXPAND ON LEGAL CHALLENGES. THAT CAN BE BROUGHT FROM FIRST AND SECOND AMENDMENT TO DISCRIMINATION AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATION IS BEING USED AS A PAWN TO FORCE THE BOARD INTO ACTION THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M QUITE INCOME OF SAN FRANCISCO. I FIRST SAW OF THE COW PALACE AFTER SERVING IN THE U. S. AIR FORCE. DURING THE KOREAN WAR.

THEY ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. MEANING THAT HAVE THE DIRECTORS ARE FROM SAN MATTEO COUNTY. HALF THE DIRECTORS ARE FROM THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THEY KNOW THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY OPERATED WITH DALY CITY AND A COUPLE OF WAYS. A ONE TIME COUNCIL WOMAN WHO ON FORTUNATELY DIED A COUPLE YEARS AGO USED TO ATTEND.

TO FOR ATTENTION THERE'S A DISCUSSION OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE LOCATION WHICH OF COURSE IS PRE EMINENT. BUT THE HELP PELOSI. IS ONE SUCH LOCATION IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT LAST LINE IS A BIT OF OVER STATE. BECAUSE LESS THAN TWO ACRES IS IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE REMAINDER IS IN THE COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO SPECIFICALLY THIS STUDY OF DALY CITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FROM THE NEXT WITNESS -- THIS BILL DID HAVE A IT WAS TRIPLE REFERRED AND SO THE OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF IN THE BILL THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING WAS HEARD BY -- THOSE COMMITTEES GEO AND TO GOVERN IN FINANCE AND IT YOU ARE OUT. CORRECT THAT ARE. I'M JURISDICTION IS ON THE GUN SHOW PORTION OF IT BUT GIVEN THAT IS ALREADY BEEN HEARD ANY OTHER COMMITTEES YOU WOULD -- YOU WE DON'T HAVE TO REALLY THE AUTHORITY DISTRICT THE PART THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST STRIPPING AND THOSE COMMITTEES. WERE THE PLACE FOR YOU TO TELL DISTRICT. ANYWAY SO WE WILL NOW IT YOU DID I'M SORRY THEN ELICIT SO LET'S GET TO THE NEXT -- WITNESS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRPERSON. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KEVIN PATTERSON AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE COALITION TO SAVE THE COW PALACE IN IN DEFERENCE TO THE VERY IMPORTANT WORK THAT WAS DONE HERE ALL DAY TODAY I'M GOING TO BE VERY BRIEF. THE BILL BEFORE US HERE IS FOR YOU PARDON ME. IS ACTUALLY TWO BILLS VERY CLEARLY. THE FIRST PORTION AS HAS BEEN STATED AS WE SPEAK AS YOU MAY WANT. TO HAVE YOUR TESTIMONY RELATE TO THE GUN SHOW ONLY SINCE THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY PART WILL HAVE JURISDICTION OVER AND SINCE IT WAS ALREADY HEARD IN THE OTHER -- TWO IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO MODIFY ANY OF THOSE OTHER PORTIONS [inaudible] I UNDERSTAND. AND I WILL BE VERY BRIEF THE TWO PARTS OF THIS BILL THE FIRST WHEN DEALING WITH A CAPITALIST DECISION ALREADY TO BAN GUN SHOWS CAN CERTAINLY BE CODIFIED BY THIS BODY INTO LAW AND WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT IF YOU DID THAT. THE SECOND PORTION OF THIS BILL VERY TROUBLING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DO NOT CONSIDER THAT IT'S PART OF YOUR JURISDICTION DEAL WITH. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THAT THE THE HELLO THIS IS A STATE FAIRGROUND. AND THE TRANSFER OF THE STATE FAIR GROUND TO A PRIVATE. ALBEIT IT IS A GOVERNMENT ARE OVERSEEN BODY IT IS NEVERTHELESS A LOCAL AUTHORITY THAT HAS NO ABILITY TO PROTECT THIS STATE FAIRGROUND. FROM. THE VERY POWERFUL. INFLUENCES OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IN THAT AREA SO ALTHOUGH I RESPECTFULLY STE -- SUBMIT TO THE YACHT -- POINTS MADE BY THE SENATOR HERE. POST THIS BILL. THAT IT IS OPEN MINDED TO THE FUTURE THE COW PALACE AND I CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT NEW BODY CAN PROTECT. THAT OUR PUBLIC ASSET. FROM THE POWERS OF THE DEVELOPMENT INTERESTS THAT WILL BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON IT. I THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU ARE. MAKE THIS BILL A COM WELL THERE IS ONE MORE THING AND THAT IS. TRUTHFULLY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE CAPITALIST POINTED BY THE BY. THE GOVERNOR. IF THE SENATOR IS UNHAPPY WITH THEM OR OF THE OTHER BODIES IN THE AREA ARE UNHAPPY WITH THEM THE GOVERNOR THIS NEW GOVERNOR CAN APPOINT NEW BOARD MEMBERS. THAT WILL THEN HAVE THE ABILITY.

HERE WE HAVE STONE IT CAME FIRST ACTUALLY. AND YEAH FOR ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SB SIX SIX SIX SO YOU GOT A GOOD NUMBER [inaudible] SENATOR STUFF [inaudible] YOU HAVE. I THINK WHAT WE DO HERE AT WE JUST WE JUST A COUPLE SECONDS HONORABLE COLLEAGUES. THE ROOM WE SHOULD HAVE NICE PEACE AND QUIET AGAIN. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR. HONORABLE COLLEAGUES -- I AM PRESENTING SB I'M NOT FOND OF THE NUMBER. SIX SIX SIX NOT A GOOD WAY TO START. LAST YEAR THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM THROUGH AB. EIGHTEEN TEN HOWEVER THE PROGRAM WAS OVERLY BROAD IN CONTAIN MANY FLAWS. IN ORDER TO RECTIFY THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A FOLLOW A MEASURE. SB. TWO ONE FIVE WHICH INCLUDED MANY FIXES AND RECEIVED NEAR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT. SB TWO ONE FIVE STATED THAT THOSE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH SEVERAL VERY SERIOUS CRIME SUCH AS MURDER AND RAPE. SHOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM. HOWEVER IN CONSULTATION WITH PROSECUTORS FOR MY DISTRICT IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. IT IS CLEAR THAT SB TWO ONE FIVE DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. THERE ARE STILL SEVERAL VERY DANGEROUS CRIMES STILL LEFT OPEN FOR POTENTIAL DIVERSION. MY BILL CLOSES THAT LOW BILL BY ADDING ARMED ROBBERY. ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. CHILD ABUSE. ELDER ABUSE THE LIST OF INELIGIBLE CRIMES FOR MENTAL HEALTH THE VERSION. IS A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS CRIMES IN THOSE ACCUSED OF SUCH CRIMES SHOULD STAND TRIAL. AND NOT BE DIVERTED TO A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO A SKATE POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT. FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EUROPE OF WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES OR TIFFANY MATTHEW SOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AGENTS PART. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN RESPECT OPPOSITION TO THE SPELL. WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S GOAL OF PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY WE DO NOT BELIEVE SB SIX SIX SIX IS NECESSARY TO FURTHER THAT PURPOSE. IMPORTANTLY EXISTING LAW PROVIDES THAT MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION WILL BE GRANTED ONLY F.. AFTER CONSIDERING THE OPINIONS% OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY THE DEFENSE OR A QUALIFIED MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS. AS WELL IF THE DEFENDANTS VIOLENCE AND CRIMINAL HISTORY THE CURRENT CHARGE DEFENSE AND ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT THE COURT DEEMS APPROPRIATE. THE COURT IS QUOTE SATISFIED THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL NOT POSE AN UNREASOABLE RISK OF DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY IF TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY AND QUOTE. THIS IS ALL TO SAY THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON CHARGED WITH ANY OF THE OFFENSES NAMED IN SB SIX SIX SIX WOULD ONLY BE GRANTED DIVERSION IF THEIR TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY. THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT JUDGES CANNOT EFFECTIVELY WAY THE RELEVANT FACTORS. AND APPROPRIATELY APPROPRIATELY USE THEIR JUDGMENT TURMAN WHO SHOULD AND WHO SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED DIVERSION. A BLANKET EXCLUSION FOR SPECIFIC CHARGES IS THEREFORE UNNECESSARY FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ASHCROFT. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- SB SIX SIX SIX SIX TO REMOVE OFFENSES FROM THE LIST OF CHARGES THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT OR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. THEREFORE UNDER SIX SIX SIX EVEN IF THE COURT INCLUDES THE VICTIM DEFENDANT AND COMMUNITY WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS COURT SUPERVISED DIVERSION AND TREATMENT. THE COURT WOULD BE POWERLESS TO ORDER IT. ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THE INMATES IN CALIFORNIA JAIL SUFFER FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. TOO OFTEN UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS IS THE REASON THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE INVOLVED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE VAST OVER CRIMINALIZATION OF THE MENTALLY ILL COUPLED WITH THE DEARTH OF SERVICES FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AS LEAD TO JAIL AND PRISON. OVERCROWDING REPEATED AND COSTLY LAWSUITS AND THE WAREHOUSING OF THE MENTALLY ILL PERSONS IN FACILITIES THAT WERE NOT DESIGNED TO TREAT THEM. WE HEARD EARLIER TESTIMONY ABOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY BEING THE LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTION IN THE NATION. IT COMPETES ONLY WITH. COOK COUNTY JAIL. I TALKED TO THE SOLANO COUNTY SHERIFF YESTERDAY. ASKING HIM -- WHAT PERCENTAGE OF HIS PUBLIC JAIL POPULATION WAS ON PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION? HE SAID 24% OF HIS JAIL POPULATION IS ON PSYCHOTROPIC OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH. THE MEDICATIONS AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE PERSONS WHO NEED MEDICATION BUT REFUSED TO TAKE IT. THE SHERIFF IN SOLANO LIKE MOST SHARE OF REFUSES TO FORCE MEDICATION. IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE LEGISLATURE TOOK STEPS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF OUR PRISONS AND JAILS TURNING INTO MAKESHIFT MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES. YOU KNOW COULD SECTION ONE THOUSAND ONE POINT THREE SET. THIS SECTION ALLOWS BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE TRIAL COURTS TO DIVERT MENTALLY ILL DEFENDANTS INTO PRE EXISTING TREATMENT PROGRAMS. WHERE THE PROPOSED TREATMENT PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEEDS OF THE DEFENDANT AND THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY? BY ALLOWING THIS EARLY DIVERSION THE MENTALLY ILL. THE COMING OF THE MENTALLY ILL THE COMMUNITY IS PROTECTED BY REDUCING RECIDIVISM RATES FOR MENTALLY ILL DEFENDANTS. AND AVOIDS THE UNNECESSARY AND UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE OF TRIAL AND INCARCERATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS I EVEN SERIOUSLY. MENTALLY ILL -- AND VERY VIOLENT OFFENDERS WHO WENT INTO VETERANS COURT. A VERY SUCCESSFUL DIVERSION PROGRAM. ALBERT C. WAS A VETERAN OF THE IRAQ WAR. WAS ORIGINALLY CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER. HE WAS IN A FULL PSYCHOSIS DO DO IS P. T. S. D.. CAME FROM HIS TOUR OF DUTY IN IRAQ. AND BELIEVE HIS ROOMMATE WAS ATTACKING HIM. HE REPEATEDLY STABBED THE ROOMMATE AND STOPPED WHEN HE FINALLY HEARD HIS ROOMMATE SCREAMING YOU'RE KILLING ME. THE CALL FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR HIS ROOMMATE AND TURNED HIMSELF IN TO THE POLICE. HE WAS THAT. AFTER GREAT DISCUSSION ADMITTED INTO THE VETERANS -- COURT. THERE WAS A GREAT DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE COURT THE DA THE DEFENSE AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION HE WAS PLACED INTO THE PROGRAM. HE GRADUATED FROM THE VETERANS COURT PROGRAM HAVING NO VIOLATIONS AND NO SANCTIONS. WHICH MEANS HE DID EVERYTHING ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. HE REMAINS IN COUNSELING AND ON MEDICATION AND IS A SUCCESSFUL MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY TODAY. JOE SO FAR WAS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON AND SPOUSAL ABUSE. DURING THE INCIDENT HE ULTIMATELY RECOGNIZE THE DANGER OF HIS ACTIONS UNLOADED HIS GUN AND TURN HIMSELF INTO THE POLICE. AS HE WORKS THROUGH VETERANS COURT YOU REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS. OF HIS MENTAL AND WILL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS KEY TO GRADUATED FROM VETERANS COURT WITH NO SANCTIONS NO VIOLATIONS AND IS A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY [inaudible] I CAN. I CAN GIVE EXAMPLES OF HOW MUCH -- DIVERSION CAN HELP THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED SERIOUS CRIMES IN TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND THOSE PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY SO TO BE CLEAR. CPT A DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT EVERY PERSON THAT SUBMITS ONE OF THESE CRIMES IS SUITABLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. HOWEVER AS WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES. OF THE COMMUNITY OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE ALSO KNOW THAT A RULE PREVENTING A NEUTRAL JUDGE FROM CONSIDERING THE INDIVIDUAL BEFORE THEM. THE FACTS OF EACH CASE. AND THE COMMUNITY IS A TREMENDOUS STEP BACKWARDS ON THE ROAD TO MEANINGFUL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM REFORM. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON AS THE THIS CALL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM [inaudible] MY COLEY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION THEN I'D LIKE THEM ALL. AND WE HAVE A MOTION. CENTER STONE YEAH LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING ASSIGNMENT -- MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST BILL APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION -- AND THEIR VIEWPOINTS -- I WISH ALL THE THE STORIES THAT THE PUBLIC DEFENDER DESCRIBED HAD A HAPPY ENDING THE WAY SHE SAYS THEY DO. BY HER OWN ADMISSION WITH THE SOLANO SHERIFF 24% HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHICH MEANS THAT DID NOT. NOT TALKING ABOUT TRIVIAL CRIMES ARE TALKING ABOUT VERY SERIOUS CRIMES. ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. SEXUALLY ABUSING A CHILD. SEXUALLY OR FINANCIALLY ABUSING AN ADULT. THESE ARE THE LIST OF AN ELIGIBLE CRIMES FOR MENTAL DIVERSION TODAY. WHICH I THINK ARE INAPPROPRIATE I'D RATHER ERR ON THE 75% THAT. DID THESE CRIMES WITH FULL MENTAL CAPACITY. THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT SHOULD BE PUNISHED. THAT'S WIRED YOUR SUPPORT OF SB SIX SIX SIX THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. I HAVE A MOTION ADAM SECTOR TO THE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORE LOCKED I WOULD LIKE AYE BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE HIGH MORALE HIGH WIENER. OKAY WE'LL PUT ON CALL. WITH A SECRETARY PLEASE NOTE THE REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION. THAT TAKES THIS TIME. WHILE I'M TWENTY ONE SENATE BILL. SEVEN SENATE BILL. SIX SEVEN SIX SEVEN EIGHT I'M. HAVING TROUBLE WITH BY SENATOR GLAZER. YEAH YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BILL IS THAT CORRECT. OKAY SO WELL MAYBE SPEAK FAST AND TRYING TO GET SENATOR JONES WITH A FEW OF THESE TWO I THINK SO LET. HIM FALL FIVE SO -- WILL TRY TO BE A VERY CONCISE ALASMY WITNESSES TO TO BE TO DO THE SAME. SO FIRST I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE THAT THE LEAD THE END CASSIDY PROVISION. THIS BILL IMPORTANTLY ESTABLISHES A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAMS OF PILOT PROGRAM IN THREE COUNTIES. CARRY OUT A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL INCARCERATION FOR A LIMITED. SET OF CRIMES A LIMITED SET OF CRIMES. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS A CENTURY OLD ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION. ALLOWS OFFENDERS TO COME FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR VICTIMS TO THE OFFENDER CAN MAKE AMENDS DIRECTLY TO THE INJURED. PARTY CAN BEGIN THE HEALING PROCESS. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE HAS BEEN PRACTICING MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND MY COMMUNITIES IN OUR CITIES THAT FEEL SHUT OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT RUN JUSTICE SYSTEM. EXPLORES HOW THESE PROGRAMS CAN IMPACT CALIFORNIA'S JUST ASSIST. THIS DIVERSION PROGRAM WOULD BE UNIQUE AMONG ANY ADULT DIVERSION PROGRAM IN THE STATE BECAUSE IT OFFERS SURVIVORS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR NEEDS VALIDATED. AND ADDRESS TO THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. TO THEIR VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION THE SURVIVOR WOULD BE ABLE. TO BE PART OF THE JUSTICE PROCESS AND WORK TO THE TRAUMA THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. AT THE SAME TIME THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COUNSELING COMMUNITY SERVICE. RESTITUTION BUT THIS. THANK YOU MEMBERS TO ATTEND SCHOOL OR WORK. IS THIS PROCESS THAT SIR THE SURVIVOR WOULD BEGIN THE PROCESS OF HEALING WHILE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY WOULD BE EXPOSED TO REAL LIFE IMPLICATIONS. OF THEIR ACTIONS AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT LED. THEM TO COMMIT THE CRIME. IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THERE'S A LOT MORE I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE COUNTRY. I EXAMPLES OF PROGRESS WITH OUR YOUTH IN REGARD TO IT AS WELL. I HAVE TO WITNESSES THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HEAR THAT HAVE SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCES IN THAT. IN THE PROGRAM AND SO JOINING ME TODAY IS FILLED MELENDEZ ROOMS. AND AND GLENN BECK FROM THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND I BY THE TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS. MEMBERS OF THE WE'RE HEARING US OUT. AS HE SAID I'M PHILLIP MELENDEZ WITH RESTORE JUSTICE AND I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AS PUT FORTH IN HIS BILL -- AND TO SAY WHY AG I GUESS I COULD GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND IT I WAS. INCARCERATED FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS -- I WAS ORIGINALLY SENTENCED TO THIRTY YEARS TO LIFE PLUS ANOTHER ELEVEN YEARS ON TOP OF THAT. HOWEVER I AM A BENEFICIARY OF SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY ONE WHICH ADVANCE MY PAROLE HEARING AND GAVE ME A CHANCE TO REDEEM -- BASED ON THE FACT THAT I WAS A TEENAGER WHEN I COMMITTED MY CRIME. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN I WAS FOUND SUITABLE FOR PAROLE WHICH IS. NO EASY TASK AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE CRIMES BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK PASSED THE TRAUMAS THAT LED ME TO A CRIMINAL LIFESTYLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND ANOTHER BARRIER. TO MY TRANSFORMATION AND HEALING WAS ACTUALLY THE PRISON ENVIRONMENT AND WHEN I FIRST BEGAN MY PRISON SENTENCE. I WAS PLACED IN A IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT WAS. MORE ABOUT SURVIVAL THAN ANY -- TRANSFORMATIVE PROGRAMS ARE HEALING AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. BUT FINALLY AFTER GETTING TO US AND CLINTON. I WAS ABLE TO TAKE SOME REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND IN ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS -- SURVIVOR OF PRIME. SHARE YOUR STORY WITH US AND NO THE FIRST TIME I EVER BROKE DOWN IN A IN A IN A GROUP. BUT IT WAS REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE AND HOW FROM FOR ME TO COME FACE TO FACE WITH THIS WOMAN TO REALLY LOOK AT THE CRIMES THAT I HAD COMMITTED INNER IN A REAL AND HONEST WAY. AND THAT PUT ME ON A POSITIVE PATH -- AFTER THAT -- AFTER TAKING THOSE PROGRAMS I LEARNED -- TO WHAT LED ME TO THE CRIME AS IS IN -- INSIDE IS NEEDED TO BE GRANTED PAROLE -- AND ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I FOUND WAS THAT YOU HAVE TO DE HUMANIZE. VICTIMS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM IS NOT HUMAN BEINGS. ACTUALLY PERPETRATED CRIME BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO HOW HARM ANOTHER HUMAN BEING -- AND THEN ONCE YOU COMMIT A CRIME. YOU PUT IN A CAGE AND PUT THROUGH A VERY IMPERSONAL PROCESS. IN THE COURT YOU APPEAR COUGHED UP -- TOLD TO FACE FORWARD ONLY LOOK AT THE JUDGE. AND DON'T LOOK AT THE VIC. CRIME. AND AND TO ME THAT'S LOOKING BACK RIBS. THAT'S NOT OKAY WITH A PRISON. PRISON SYSTEM CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I'M SORRY IT'S A LITTLE NERVE WRACKING ENOUGH HERE AND NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CROWD BUT IT'S HARD TO HEAR THESE THINGS ANYWAY -- BUT YEAH SO JUST LOOKING AT THE PRISON SYSTEM -- WE DON'T REQUIRE OFFENDERS TO SEE THEIR VICTIMS AND THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AMENDS EVEN IF THE VICTIM BELIEVES THAT THIS CONTACT WOULD HELP THEM HEAL AND OBTAIN JUSTICE. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS PROGRAM WOULD NOT INCLUDE -- OFFENDERS ACCUSED OF THE MOST SERIOUS CRIMES LIKE. THE ONES THAT I'VE COMMITTED. BUT I CAN DEFINITELY ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT FACING THE TRUTH OF THE HARM THAT YOU'VE CAUSED IS DEEPLY TRANSFORMATIVE AND CAN SPARK HUGE SHIFTS. IN THE WAY WE SEE OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AND THE WAY THAT WE SEE OUR COMMUNITIES. AND IN HAVING THOSE DIALOGUES BETWEEN SURVIVORS AND THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR HARM IS ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL THAT I THINK. WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND INCREASED PUBLIC SAFETY SO I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE SUPPORT SENATE BILL. SIX SEVENTY EIGHT TO PLAY SURVIVORS OF CRIME AT THE CENTER OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE IF. TO BE MADE WHOLE AGAIN. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER MELENDEZ. GOOD AFTERNOON GOING BACK AS FOR ALL BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS I'LL BE BRIEF I WANT TO FOCUS ON HOW THIS BILL IS AN EXAMPLE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT -- THE SENATOR AND THE SPONSORS OF IDENTIFIED A PROMISING PRACTICE SOMETHING THERE'S GOING WELL IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION FOR TEN YEARS IN BROOKLYN NEW YORK. ANOTHER PRETTY FOR THE BUILDINGS A PILOT SUBJECT TO LOCAL CONTROL SUBJECT TO A SUNSET. AND SORRY TO EVALUATION THIS IS SORT OF HOW WE SHOULD DO GOVERNMENT THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD EVALUATE. AND INNOVATE [inaudible] THERE'S ALL THE OPTIONS WILL STILL BE THERE THAT WE HAVE TODAY. BUT THE OPTIONS TODAY ARE GENERALLY INCARCERATE. PROBATION SUPERVISION OR NOT. THIS BILL GIVES FOR IN A JURISDICTION WHERE TO PROVE BECAUSE AGAIN STILL SORRY TO LOCAL CONTROL YOU HAVE TO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT APPROVAL. AND LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY APRIL. TO EVEN HAVE THIS PROCESS. THEN. THAT ALLOWS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO OFFER THE SURVIVOR OF CRIME ONE OTHER OPTION. NOTHING PROBATION JAIL OR AT WHAT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOU ACT IF THE PERSON HAD TO FACE YOU. AND LISTEN TO YOU CAN HEAR FROM YOU WHAT HOW IT FELT. TO BE VICTIMIZED. WHAT WOULD IT FEEL LIKE IF THAT MAKE AMENDS DIRECTLY TO YOU? WHERE THEY DO RESTITUTION DIRECTLY TO YOU BUT IF THEY HAD TO GROW IN FRONT OF YOU? AS OPPOSED TO BEING SENT TO A CELL IN AN ANONYMOUS PROCESS. AND SO THEN EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE THIS THIRTY TO THE APPROVAL. FOR MOST OF THE SURVIVOR THE CRIME. DOES THE VICTIM WANT THIS. ACTUALLY THE DEFENDANT ALSO HAS TO AGREE. JUST RETURNING THE DEFENSE THE COURT AND THE PROGRAM THAT WILL RUN IT ALL HAVE TO AGREE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. FOR ANYONE TO PRODUCE. SO LIKE I SAID I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW GOVERNMENT SHOULD WORK. IDENTIFY PROMISING PRACTICE BRING IT FORWARD [inaudible] EVALUATE. IT WAS WORTH REPLICATING LIKE I SAID THIS IS A SUNSET. SOCIAL CONTROL SO YOU TO EVALUATION I THINK IT'S VERY PROMISING PRACTICE. HAVE ALL YOUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OKAY SO ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM THAT ONE I JUST INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT OF THE GOOD AFTERNOON ANDRE PERRY WITH CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AS WELL AS CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE WE THINK THE AUTHOR -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M NOT SURE HERNANDEZ IN HALF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSFER KAMEL JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. JIM LINDBERGH ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE IN SOME [inaudible] ANY OTHER. ALL RIGHT SO NOW LET'S SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SELECT A DATE. MY TO SINCE I STILL HAVE TO GO PERCENT THREE MORE. BILLS AND OTHER COMMITTEE SO YOU -- MAKE CLOSE -- AND UNLESS SENATOR MORTON Là YOU'D LIKE QUESTION. OKAY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEN MEMBERS FOR HEARING OF ABOUT THIS BILL I KNOW IT. IT GETS A LITTLE OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE IN TERMS OF HOW OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS WORKING TODAY AND MAYBE NOT WORKING TODAY. BUT AS THE WITNESSES OF INDICATE TO PILOT. IT HAS LIMITED APPLICATION IT HAS EVALUATION. COMPONENTS REQUIRES THE COOPERATION OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND JUST DO IT WITHOUT. ANY ANY ONE PARTY SAND -- ANYTHING BUT YES. AND SO I THINK IT HAS A LOT OF HOPE AND PROMISE IT'S WIDE. BILLING WHY AM. I ES GOT ME OUT OF MY OWN CONVENTIONAL WIFE. FIND RICARDO. JUSTICE SYSTEM I WANT TO THANK BILL COMING AND SHARING HIS PERSONAL STORY AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA THANK. STORAGE. NOW YOU. WE'VE BEEN INFORMED THAT THE CHAIR SHOULD NOT BE MAKING MOTIONS AND I'M. HESITANT TO MAKE MOTIONS FOR WHEN IT ASKED SOME QUESTIONS. BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE OF WHERE I'M GETTING HUNG UP SENATOR GLAZERS IS THE TERM -- GRANT PROGRAM I'M. A FIVE YEAR COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM THREE COUNTY SAN I'M WONDERING WORST. WHERE'S THE GRANT MONEY COME FROM. THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME THAT. NAVIN IS AVAILABLE THAT WOULD GO THROUGH THE TYPICAL BUDGET PROCESS WHETHER THAT'S PROP FORTY SEVEN MONEY OR FOR GENERAL FUND MONEY. DON'T KNOW IF THE BILL AT THAT THE FUNDING MECHANISM IS IS A PART OF THIS BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU. YEAH SO IT WOULD BE UPON APPROPRIATIONS SO. IT SHOULD BE A HOPEFULLY NOT A HANG UP IN TERMS OF THE VALUE OF THE POTENTIAL OF THE PROGRAM DOES STILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THE BUDGET APPROVAL AND THEN WHATEVER. PLACE THAT THE MONEY'S GONNA BE ACQUIRED. A WELL I I WILL NOT BE VOTING ON THIS TODAY JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO DO MORE RESEARCH. IN IN THERE FOR AYE AYE THE MOTION. SURE WE CAN WAIT TILL WE CAN WAIT ON A MOTION. WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS BACK. ROLAND BUT ANYWAY. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU WILL BE HAVE -- NECESSARILY HEALTH CENTER PLACER JUST MEANS THAT WE WOULD WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE OUR MEMBERS. SCHERING AG CLOSE WITH A COMMENT YES YOU MAY JUST TO NOTE THAT. THE COST OF INCARCERATION THINK ABOUT THE PRICE THERE THIS IS. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND MAINTAIN OUR STATE -- PRISON SYSTEM. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND AND LOOK WHAT I ALSO WAS LEFT BEHIND THEIR ABILITY. TO A RESTORED FAITH AND HUMANITY OF THE SURVIVOR AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND OF COURSE THE PERSON THAT'S IN CORPORATE AND CARS RATED THAT. THEIR POTENTIAL AND THEY HAVE POTENTIAL TO BE GOOD. AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO ALSO LOST BEHIND THOSE BARS TO SELL. THERE IS A COST TO THIS ALTHOUGH WHAT IT'LL BE DELIBERATING ITS OWN WAY. BUT THE POTENTIAL OF IT IS. IS ENORMOUS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I DID DO YOU HAVE A I RECOMMENDATION ON IT AND WE'LL SEE WHAT. HE DOES WHEN WE HAVE TO MEMBERS BACK. THANK. THANK YOU. AND NOW WE WILL GO TO OUR FINAL BILL. AND SENATOR JONES HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM ALSO ALL TIMES TODAY. AND SO WILL ALLOW HIM. TO PRESENT YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE MISUNDERSTANDING AND HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM THREE TIMES WITH THREE TIMES AS A CHARM I HOPE SO. WELL I'M AND MY EARLIER BILL I WAS I CAN SEND AYE AS SO IT WAS UP ON HIGHER UP ON THE ANYWAYS OPPOSITE THIS BILL NOW. SB. SEVEN OH ONE I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I YOU SHOULD EACH HAVE A MARK UP IN FRONT OF YOU AND THINKING TO COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THE BILL I KNOW IT'S SAID OFTEN BUT IN THIS CASE IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE AMENDMENTS MAKE THE BILL -- MUCH MORE WORKABLE AND BETTER SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT SB SEVEN OH ONE CORRECTS A DUE PROCESS VIOLATION. CURRENTLY IN LAW BY CLARIFYING THAT THE MERE ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT DOES NOT MAKE A FELON OUT OF AN OTHERWISE LAWFUL GUN OWNER. THE PROVISION ADDING AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT TO PENAL CODE SECTIONS. TWO NINE EIGHT ZERO ZERO AND TWO NINE EIGHT ZERO FIVE WAS ADDED IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LATER THAT SAME YEAR ATTEMPT WAS MADE IN YET ANOTHER BUDGET TRAILER BILL. TO CLEAN UP THE REQUIREMENT BY REQUIRING THE DEFENDANT HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WARRANT. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEW CODE SECTION ADDED WAS MISS NUMBERED AND PRETTY MUCH ON FIND OF ALL. LAST YEAR THE THE NEW CODE SECTION WITH THE KNOWLEDGE REQUIREMENT WAS RE NUMBERED THROUGH THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES MAINTENANCE. OF THE CODES BILL. THIS PUT IT CLOSER TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE BUT SINCE NONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WENT THROUGH THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THE NEW CODE SECTION WAS VIRTUALLY UNKNOWN AND OFTEN OVERLOOKED. SO NOW WE'RE HERE TO FIX IT WITH A POLICY BILL IN FRONT OF A POLICY COMMITTEE. SB SEVEN OH ONE WILL DELETE THE ATTEMPTED FIX AND INSTEAD CLARIFY IN THE CORRECT CODE SECTIONS. THAT A PERSON WITH AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT FOR AN OFFENSE MUST HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THAT WARRANT. IN ORDER TO BE GUILTY OF A MISDEMEANOR FOR ILLEGALLY POSSESSING A FIREARM. AGAIN I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK TO CLEAN UP THIS ISSUE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY WITH ME IS LAURIE DOYLE ON BEHALF OF THE CONFERENCE OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATIONS -- SMALL PRESENTATION ANSWER QUESTIONS. THEY WILL JUST HOLD IT PRETTY MUCH ANSWERING QUESTIONS THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS OF THIS BILL IS A GOOD REASON WHY POLICY DECISION SHOULD BE MADE BY THE POLICY COMMITTEES -- BECAUSE THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE WE HAD THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS WERE MEMBERS OF THE CONFERENCE -- TO THOUGHT THAT THE EXISTING LAW. DIDN'T WORK VERY WELL BECAUSE IT SET UP A SITUATION WHERE. YOU CAN BE. YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER BEEN A YOU DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WARRANT. YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF ANY CRIME OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU STILL GUILTY OF A FELONY FOR POSSESSING A AND SO THEY'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT. WAS A GOOD WORK OF STAFF. TO HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT IT ACTUALLY GONE ON AND THE AMENDMENTS NO CORRECT THE SITUATION. SO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NAY NEED OF USING THE STATUTE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT IT DOES. WITH THE LIMITATIONS ARE AND IT'S A LOT BETTER POLICY. AND I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT ARE THERE OTHER ON ANYONE ELSE HERE IN SUPPORT. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT GREAT. I'M ANY OTHERS.
