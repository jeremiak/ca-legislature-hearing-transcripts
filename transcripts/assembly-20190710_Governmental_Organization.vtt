ONE ONE SYSTEM.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:24.606
IN THOSE CASES WOULD HAVE WORKED.

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:25.974
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WENT DOWN

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:26.274
[inaudible]

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:28.410
RAPIDLY.

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:28.977
THEREFORE THOSE PEOPLE WOULD

IS IS ALMOST UNDOABLE -- JUST.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:44.593
A LITTLE HISTORY THERE ARE

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:45.660
BECAUSE IT TAKES AWHILE TO

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:46.828
ACTUALLY VERIFY [inaudible]

01:17:46.895 --> 01:17:49.431
THAT'S THAT'S ONE JUST KIND OF

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:52.100
STATEMENT -- THE OTHER ISSUE IS

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.602
I THINK THE QUALIFICATION OF

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.904
WHAT IS A COMMUNITY MEAN OR WHAT

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.272
IS THAT I CENTRIC AREA MEAN IS

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:59.041
THAT.

01:17:59.107 --> 01:18:01.810
ONE USER FOR USERS.

01:18:01.877 --> 01:18:04.146
IS IT MORE THAN THAT.

01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.313
THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:09.051
AND THE AND THE IF I COULD ALL

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.919
ALL AT A SECOND QUESTION ON THIS

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.320
IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:15.157
SO I DON'T COMPOUND.

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.426
NO GO AHEAD IF THE ONE ON TO

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:18.393
THAT AND THEN I'LL ASK MYSELF.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.327
THANK YOU SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ON

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.263
THE ISSUE OF DISCOVERY SO.

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.131

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.966

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.302
NOTIFICATION.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.304
SO -- AND THE REASON WHY THAT IS

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:32.174
SO IMPORTANT -- IS THAT ALLOWS

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:36.278
INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:40.415
pAND THEN AFTER THE OUTAGE HAS

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:41.049
BEEN DISCOVERED A CUT CABLE FOR

01:18:41.116 --> 01:18:42.918
EXAMPLE.

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:45.320
A BURNED FIBER LINE.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:47.122
WITHIN ONE HOUR THAT DISCOVERY.

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:49.091
THEY WOULD THEN CALL INTO THE

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:50.659
CALIFORNIA WARNING CENTER WITH

01:18:50.725 --> 01:18:54.396

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:00.235
ONE ONE OUT EACH.

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:02.337
ANY OUTAGE IMPACTING AN

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.005
EMERGENCY ALERT LINE.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:09.211
WE ON THE ISSUE OF PARADISE --

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:10.879
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:12.114
AND I WILL ALSO SPEAK FOR THE

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.482
TUBS FIRE AS WELL [inaudible]

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:16.618
IS THAT.

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:19.221
PARADISE WE HAD THE BUTTE COUNTY

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:20.822
SHERIFF HE HE WISHES HE COULD BE

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:23.925
HERE TESTIFIED PREVIOUSLY --

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.794
THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THOSE

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:26.728
ALERTS FOR NOT HITTING

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:27.028
[inaudible]

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.698
RESIDENTS.

01:19:29.764 --> 01:19:31.900
A NO IS DOWN.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.401
WE DIDN'T KNOW IS DOWN BECAUSE

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:35.137
THE FCC GETS THE FIRST NOTICE OF

01:19:35.203 --> 01:19:37.472
AN OUTAGE.

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:38.440
YES YOU SEE THEN BECAUSE THE P.

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:39.708

PC SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:42.611
WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:44.279
DEALING WITH FIRST RESPONDERS.

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:46.615
THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT.

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.149
WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES OF AN

01:19:47.215 --> 01:19:48.383
OUTAGE.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.451
AND I'M MAKING THIS UP AT THE

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.319
MOMENT EIGHTEEN T. VERIZON

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:53.188
WHOEVER THAT CARRIER MAY BE.

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.524
WOULD NOTIFY THE WARNING CENTER

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:58.026
HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:58.860
THE WARNING CENTER WOULD THEN

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:00.028
CALL.

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:01.897
THE EMERGENCY MANAGER.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.700
INCIDENT.

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:08.336
SO I THINK IT'S COMMONSENSE IT

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:10.138
CUTS THAT MIDDLEMAN WHICH WE

01:20:10.205 --> 01:20:14.743
SIMPLY DO NOT NEED -- AND BUT IT

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:15.911
WOULD BE SIX IN HIS POND

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:16.745
DISCOVERY.

01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:18.547
OKAY SO THAT GETS SENT TO PART

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:19.848
OF MY SECOND QUESTION BT IT TO

HOW WOULD THAT TELL BECAUSE OF

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:32.794
NO?

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:33.428
HOW WOULD THEY HAVE KNOWN RIGHT

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.497
AWAY AND VERIFIED THAT THEY DID

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.065
HAVE AN OUTAGE THEIR FIBER WAS

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:38.800
BURNED?

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:39.834
THAT'S THAT'S REAL GOOD HOW

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:40.335
WOULD THEY KNOW WITHOUT

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.636
VERIFYING.

01:20:41.703 --> 01:20:42.404

GO IN BECAUSE IT'S A DISASTER

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:45.507
ZONE IT'S AN IMPACTS ON HOW

WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO SEND A

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:48.276
CREW OUT TO VERIFY AND HOW LONG

01:20:48.343 --> 01:20:49.211
WOULD THAT TAKE SO THEY WERE

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:51.646
ABLE TO ERIFY ENOUGH TO THE FCC

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:52.681
THAT THE FIRST.

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:53.815
AND THIS IS ACCORDING THE OFFICE

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:57.819
EMERGENCY SERVICES STATE RECORDS --

01:20:57.886 --> 01:20:59.287

THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.098
CUTS THE MIDDLE PERSON OUT.

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:45.000
IN THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON AT

THE SEC'S INVOLVED IN THIS AND

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:49.304
SO RIGHT NOW THIS RIDICULOUS

01:21:49.371 --> 01:21:50.105
CHAIN AND EVENTS AND I DON'T

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:52.107
MEAN TO I'M.

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:52.974
NOT PLACE TIME AND I APOLOGIZE.

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:54.276
IT'S QUITE ALRIGHT I THINK THIS

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.944
IS WHAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:57.312
ABOUT NEWS IT'S GOOD FOR US

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.913
BECAUSE TYPICALLY OF LATE WE WE

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.015
HAVEN'T HAD THIS DETAILED

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:00.482
DISCUSSION.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:02.250
ON IN COMMITTEES AND I THINK

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:03.251
THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR WOULD

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:04.986
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:05.587
DETAILED DISCUSSION YEAH TO

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.422
BETTER UNDERSTAND SO WE HAVE THE

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.057
BEST PRODUCT GOING FORWARD. FOR

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:10.492
ALL PEOPLE I MEAN I'M ON YOUR

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:13.862
PAGER YEAH I'M TRYING TO GET.

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.430
GET THERE SO SO TRY TO WORK IT

01:22:15.497 --> 01:22:15.697
THROUGH.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.399
I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THAT

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:18.800
FIBER WIN OUT THERE'S ALMOST AN

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:21.336
INSTANTANEOUS -- A SPARK THAT

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:22.704
OCCURS INSIDE A COMPLETE

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.040
COMPUTER AND THEN IT SENDS UP

01:22:25.106 --> 01:22:26.675
INTO A RING LOOP WHICH AT THAT

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.376
MOMENT IN THE BLINK OF YOUR AYE

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:34.849
THAT YOU JUST POINT THREE TIMES

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:37.652
FOUR TIMES SIX TIMES DOWN.

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:38.620
IT SHOT.

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.989
A SIGNAL AND REVERSE THAT COURSE

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.257
AND MAY HAVE SENATE A HUNDRED

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.092
MILES AROUND BUT THIS CONTINUITY

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.660
DIDN'T BREAK.

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:48.596
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED NINE ONE

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:49.564
ONE DID GO DOWN NO NO NO?

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.032
IT DID.

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.600
BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MORE.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.869
I ABILITY FOR TO CONNECT.

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:55.804
AND WHEN IT DIDN'T CONNECT IT

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:56.671
WAS COMPLETELY LOST BUT NOBODY

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:58.006
COULD TELL YOU WHY ARE IF IT WAS

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:58.807
A SIMPLE FIX WITHIN A GLITCH OF

01:22:58.873 --> 01:22:59.808
A COMPUTER AND THEY NEEDED TO

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:01.209
VERIFY THAT BUT THEY DIDN'T THEY

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:02.310
DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT.

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.179
WAS GOING DOWN BUT IT TOOK A

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.780
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH.

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.916
THE WITHIN THE INTERNAL SYSTEM

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:09.284
AS WELL.

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:11.119
SO THE CHALLENGE THAT -- MINOR

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:12.787
SEEN THE CHALLENGE AND I CAN LET

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:13.355
DECISION CHAIR OF NO I MEAN

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:15.223
THERE WERE OUTAGES FOR EXAMPLE

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.024
AND SAY NO MY COUNTY.

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:18.626
AND FOLKS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:20.829
CALLING NOW 911- READ COM WAS

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.497
RECEIVING NINE ONE ONE CALLS

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:24.499
FROM AROUND OTHER AREAS OF THE

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.501
COUNTY BUT DID NOT REALIZE THAT

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:28.236
THEIR OUTAGES IN SPECIFIC AREAS

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:29.838
THAT WERE BEING IMPACTED BY THE

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:30.705
TUBS FIRE.

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.774
THIS BILL SOLVES THAT SO LET'S

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:33.541
JUST SAY YOU KNOW USE THE TUBS

01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:36.010
FIRE EXIT FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:38.046
AN OUTAGE UPON MARK WHY SPRINGS

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:41.750
ROAD.

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:44.119
BECAUSE THE FIRES BURNED.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:46.721
I'M I'M USING THIS IMAGE EXAMPLE

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:48.456
EIGHTEEN TI WOULD THEN CALL THE

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.023
WARNING CENTER THAT DOESN'T

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.024
HAPPEN.

01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:53.561
WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS IF A FIBERS

01:23:53.628 --> 01:23:54.996
BURN A FIBER IS BURNED?

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:57.632
INDUSTRY WILL CALL THE SEC

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:58.199
THEY'RE FEDERALLY REGULATED

01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:00.268
UTILITY.

01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:03.238
SEC THEN DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:04.572
BECAUSE THE PC.

01:24:04.639 --> 01:24:07.008
UNDERSTAND THEIR COUNTERPART.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.943
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE PC

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:09.711
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FLIPPING

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.312
DISASTERS.

01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:12.647
SO THIS LITTLE IT CUTS THE

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.016
MIDDLE PERSON WILL BE ABLE -- TO

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.551
GET THIS IN -- ESSENTIALLY REAL

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:19.487
TIME BUT AGAIN WE PROVIDE FOR

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:20.088
SIXTY MINUTES UPON DISCOVERING

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:22.123
THIS BILL SO THIS IS A GOOD

01:24:22.190 --> 01:24:22.991
EXCHANGE FOR ROOM BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:24.192
HEARING A LOT OF GOOD

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:25.627
INFORMATION.

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.462
AND AGAIN I'M GOING TO REITERATE

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:31.499
I'M ON YOUR PAYCHECK -- ON THIS

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.268
SO -- A JUST ON THEIR CLOTHES I

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.303
HAVE TWO CLARIFICATION TIER ONE

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:36.671
WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:39.607
NUMBER WOULD BE JUST ONE PHONE

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:41.142
THAT'S OUT.

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.777
CURRENTLY IS THE BILL READS IT

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.612
IS ANY OUTAGE YES THAT'S

01:24:44.679 --> 01:24:45.680
CURRENTLY HAVE THE BILL READS

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:46.347
OKAY.

01:24:46.414 --> 01:24:47.549
SO THE SO THAT CAN BE.

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:48.049
I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS

01:24:48.116 --> 01:24:48.550
EDITORIAL THAT COULD BE

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:49.551
PROBLEMATIC FOR SOME OF THOSE

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:51.453
MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES -- WHERE

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:52.554
THEY THEY HAVE THE ONE OFF

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.456
PERSON THAT LIVES SEVERAL MILES

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:55.723
OUT AND?

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.425
THAT MAY NOT BE EVEN AN OUTAGE

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.561
BECAUSE OF THE TELCO THAT MAY BE

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:02.664
AN OUTAGE BECAUSE THEIR OWN --

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:06.401
PHONIES GONE BAD -- STILL CAN'T

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:09.370
CONNECT IF THE PHONE DOESN'T GET

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:09.904
ENERGIZED BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:11.005
WORKING.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:11.940
SO THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE ONE BUT

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.074
LET ME COME BACK.

01:25:13.141 --> 01:25:15.410
TO REALLY WHAT.

01:25:15.477 --> 01:25:17.212
WELL I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:17.979
I THINK THE CHAIR ASKED A

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:19.080
LEGITIMATE QUESTION AND I'D LIKE

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.282

WILL WANT.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:26.421

BROUGHT FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE

01:25:29.824 --> 01:25:30.825
AND I THINK THOSE ARE WORKABLE

01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:33.061
AND MAKE IT FAR MORE SUPPORTABLE

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:37.265

TODAY WE COULD DO IT ON THE

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:24.906
FLOOR -- WITH THE APPROVAL THE

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.240
RULES COMMITTEE AND I THINK

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:28.042
THERE'S A RULES COMMITTEE

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:30.311

MAYBE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

01:32:31.779 --> 01:32:34.949
AND THAT WOULD BE PERHAPS --

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:37.485
AVENUE TO MOVE THIS EVEN QUICKER --

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.353

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:09.917
THE APA PROCESS INCLUDES THE

01:33:09.984 --> 01:33:10.885
ABILITY FOR AN AGENCY TO MAKE

FUNCTIONAL FOR THE STATE -- IN I

01:34:40.641 --> 01:34:44.812
THINK IT'S A IT'S A HUGE GAP

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:47.948
THAT -- WILL COST LIVES.

PARTISAN ISSUE AND IN TALKING

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:52.119

AFTER GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS

01:40:41.835 --> 01:40:43.237
THIS CITY WILL HAVE TO PRODUCE A

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:45.038
PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN.

01:40:45.105 --> 01:40:46.440
AND A TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:48.442
ENSURE THAT IT'S DOING ANALYSIS

01:40:48.509 --> 01:40:50.878

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:08.595
STEPS HAPPENED -- AND AND THEN

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:10.197
EVEN AFTER THE PLAN GOES INTO

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:11.365
EFFECT.

01:41:11.432 --> 01:41:13.267

HEARING OR SEEK MODIFICATIONS.

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:31.819
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN

01:41:31.885 --> 01:41:33.587
MIND THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:35.255
REQUIRE CITIES TO HAVE AN ON

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.790
SWITCH OFF SWITCH FOR THEIR

01:41:36.857 --> 01:41:37.858
ENTIRE CITY IN FACT I THINK IT'S

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.460
UNLIKELY THAT ANY CITY.

01:41:39.526 --> 01:41:41.295
WHAT DO THE CITY WIDE I THINK A

01:41:41.361 --> 01:41:42.396
LOT OF TIMES TO PUT YOUR THIS

01:41:42.463 --> 01:41:42.963

DECIDE THIS THIS WILL ONLY

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:52.372
HAPPEN IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:54.308
ONE ENTERTAINMENT ZONE -- WE'RE

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:55.576
IN A LIMITED AREA AND I THINK

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:57.711
MOST CITIES WOULD DO THAT --

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:59.079
CITIES ALSO THE ABILITY TO

01:41:59.146 --> 01:42:00.948
DECIDE HOW MANY NIGHTS A WEEK OR

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:03.450
A YEAR A CITY COULD GO -- SEVEN

STATEMENT WITHOUT QUESTION.

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:37.917
THESE TWO EXTRA HOURS WILL

CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:46.593
HOWEVER STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT

01:52:46.659 --> 01:52:49.762
THIS WILL INCREASE DRINKING AND

01:52:49.829 --> 01:52:51.598
WHICH LEAD TO MORE DRUNK DRIVING.

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:09.816

HERE'S WHAT THEY FOUND.

01:54:46.546 --> 01:54:48.982
BASICALLY -- IF YOU TAKE ALL THE

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:50.216

01:54:50.283 --> 01:54:51.918

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.594
THAT WOULD STAY OPEN THE NUMBER

01:55:01.661 --> 01:55:03.129
OF DRINKS TO COULD BE SERVE THE

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:04.430
PRICE FOR THOSE DRINKS THE TAXES

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:05.898
WOULD BE CHARGE OF THOSE PRICES.

01:55:05.965 --> 01:55:07.300
AND WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH IS AN

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:08.801
ESTIMATE OF THE QUOTE UNQUOTE

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:10.203
THE BENEFITS.

01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:12.038
UP THEY DO NOT LOOK AT EXTRA

01:55:12.105 --> 01:55:13.439
BUSINESS BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY'S

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:15.041
IN A BAR BUYING A DRINK THAT

01:55:15.108 --> 01:55:16.175
MEANS ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:55:16.242 --> 01:55:17.410
SPENDING THE MONEY SO IT'S MONEY

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:18.878
THAT'S EITHER GOING TO THE BAR

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:20.413
OWNER SOMEBODY ELSE IN TOWN --

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:22.015
BUT IT'S THE SAME MONEY AND IT

01:55:22.081 --> 01:55:23.016
DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY JOBS

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:24.917
BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES A JOB AWAY

01:55:24.984 --> 01:55:26.252
FROM ONE PERSON.

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:27.787
TO YOU KNOW SPEND IT AT THE BAR.

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:28.788
AND I THINK A MORE INTERESTING

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.323
POINT IS IT DOESN'T COUNT

01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:32.358
TOURISM BECAUSE THERE ARE NO

01:55:32.425 --> 01:55:34.360
ESTIMATES THAT I'VE SEEN ON HOW

01:55:34.427 --> 01:55:36.162
THIS TOURISM MAGIC WOULD

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:38.097
ACTUALLY WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA --

01:55:38.164 --> 01:55:39.332
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CITIES THAT

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:41.000
HAVE VERY MATURE TOURISM

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:42.468
INDUSTRIES ALREADY SAN FRANCISCO

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:44.304
LOS ANGELES PALM SPRINGS AND

01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:45.672
OTHER CITIES THE FRANKLY IT'S

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.440
HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW.

01:55:47.507 --> 01:55:48.741
SACRAMENTO WAR FRESNO ALREADY

01:55:48.808 --> 01:55:50.343
BECOME TOURIST MECCA IS JUST

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.378
BECAUSE OF THIS BILL -- BUT IN

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:54.080
ANY EVENT THERE'S NO HARD

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:56.215
EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.051
BY ANY OF THE POINT TO THIS BILL

01:55:58.117 --> 01:55:59.185
THE TOURISM IS GOING TO BE

01:55:59.252 --> 01:56:00.119
BENEFIT.

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.487
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO CALCULATE

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:03.356
ANY KIND OF GAME ON THE OTHER

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:05.525
HAND TO CALCULATE THE LOSSES YOU

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:07.026
HAVE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE

01:56:07.093 --> 01:56:08.061
CONTROL ESTIMATE.

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:10.630
ON WHAT IN DOLLAR TERMS THE

01:56:10.697 --> 01:56:12.732
HUMAN COSTS ARE THAT IS THE CAR

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:18.237
WRECKS THE VIOLENCE THE CRIME

01:56:18.304 --> 01:56:20.306
ALL THE THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:21.240
WITH EXTRA PEOPLE DRINKING EXTRA

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:21.708
BLUES.

01:56:21.774 --> 01:56:22.842
AND SO -- TAKING THE ESTIMATES

THE HUMAN HARM THOUGH BECAUSE BY

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:27.613
THIS BILL VERSUS THE DOLLAR

01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.316
ESTIMATES OF THE TAX REVENUES

01:56:30.383 --> 01:56:31.551
AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE.

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:33.619
CALCULATED WE FIND THAT THERE IS

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.021
A MAJOR SHORTFALL THE REPORT

EVERY DOLLAR QUOTA COULD GAIN

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:47.567
THROUGH TAX REVENUES.

01:56:47.633 --> 01:56:49.035
YOU HAVE MORE THAN TWO DOLLARS

01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:51.270

IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:01.827
SAFETY IS ABSOLUTELY ONE ASPECT.

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:03.896
OF THIS ISSUE AND THIS BILL AND

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:05.764
OUT TO OUR WE WORKED WITH C. H.

02:10:05.831 --> 02:10:07.232
P. AND WE WORKED WITH THE POLICE

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:09.635
CHIEF THIS IS. TWO YEARS AGO AND

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:11.637
THEY ASK FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WE

02:10:11.703 --> 02:10:12.638
PUT INTO THE BILL IN THOSE

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:13.906
MOMENTS OF NEVER CHANGE IN THE

02:10:13.972 --> 02:10:16.675
BILL. TO MANDATE THAT BOTH CHT

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:18.310
AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BE

02:10:18.377 --> 02:10:20.913
INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS --

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:23.048
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WHEN

02:10:23.115 --> 02:10:24.316
THEY MADE THAT REQUEST TO MADE

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:25.951
ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD TO ME

02:10:26.018 --> 02:10:27.586
BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:33.692
HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE -- OKAY

02:10:33.759 --> 02:10:34.693
IT IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS

02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:35.761
IMPORTANT ASPECT IT'S NOT THE

02:10:35.827 --> 02:10:36.728
ONLY ASPECT.

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:38.096
NIGHT LIFE IS NOT I THINK

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:39.331
SOMETIMES WE TEND TO VIEW NIGHT

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:41.700
LIFE ONLY AND THE NEGATIVE --

02:10:41.767 --> 02:10:43.468
AND IT'S NOT JUST AROUND DRIVING

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:45.103
WHEN PEOPLE SAY OH THE PERSON

02:10:45.170 --> 02:10:47.005
WAS STUMBLING DOWN THE STREET --

02:10:47.072 --> 02:10:48.140
URINATED ON MY FRONT PORCH AND

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:49.474
PEOPLE LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE.

02:10:49.541 --> 02:10:51.043
AND THE POSITIVE ABOUT NIGHT

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:54.046
LIFE GETS COMPLETELY LOST -- IT

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:55.647
IN THE SHUFFLE AND THERE ARE AND

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:57.349
WE HAVE TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:58.984
NEGATIVE AND WE DO THAT IN THIS

02:10:59.051 --> 02:11:00.819
BILL -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:02.554
POSITIVE TO NIGHT LIFE IS ONE

02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:04.890
THERE'S A REASON WHY SO MANY

02:11:04.957 --> 02:11:05.424
PEOPLE [inaudible]

02:11:05.490 --> 02:11:06.892
GO OUT.

02:11:06.959 --> 02:11:08.193
WHY PEOPLE GO OUT AND ENJOY

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.329
THEMSELVES AND WHY PEOPLE WANT

02:11:10.395 --> 02:11:12.231
TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT -- AT A

02:11:12.297 --> 02:11:14.299
TIME THAT IS NOT HOW WE DO IT

02:11:14.366 --> 02:11:15.534
RIGHT NOW.

02:11:15.601 --> 02:11:16.902
THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO GET OFF WORK

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:18.170
AT MIDNIGHT.

02:11:18.237 --> 02:11:19.304
AND THEY CAN'T GO OUT NOW

02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:21.073
THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN GO BACK

02:11:21.139 --> 02:11:22.307
HOME AND CHANGE OR GO OUT BY.

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:24.610
TWO NOT EVERYONE WORKS IN NINE

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:25.611
TO FIVE JOB WORKS WHAT WE'RE

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:27.312
CONSIDERED TRADITIONAL SCHEDULE

02:11:27.379 --> 02:11:28.680
SO THIS IS SIMPLY PROVIDING

02:11:28.747 --> 02:11:30.415
FLEXIBILITY AND YES THIS IS

02:11:30.482 --> 02:11:32.050
GOING TO BE A LOCAL DECISION FOR

02:11:32.117 --> 02:11:33.619
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR THE

02:11:33.685 --> 02:11:34.386
LOCAL.

02:11:34.453 --> 02:11:36.722
I. CITY COUNCIL IT IS A FIVE

BILL WOULD LIMIT IT.

02:11:52.104 --> 02:11:54.840
ONLY TO CITIES WHO HAVE TOLD US

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:56.174

PERIOD TO GIVE COMMUNITY SO THE

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:14.326
COMMUNITIES DON'T FEEL RUSHED TO

DO THE PLAN AND WE DON'T WANT IT

02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:17.663
TO BE -- WE HAVE FIVE YEARS AND

02:12:17.729 --> 02:12:19.031
IF WE TAKE OUR TIME TO DO

02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:20.265
PLANNING IS GOING TO EAT AWAY AT

02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:22.401
THE FIVE YEARS WE GIVE A TWO

02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:23.535
YEAR RAMP UP SO THAT THEY THEY

02:12:23.602 --> 02:12:25.404

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:27.205
AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY.

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:28.974
AROUND TRANSPORTATION PASSER

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:30.342
ORDINANCE IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:35.347
SO GIVE ABC TIME TO REVIEW THE

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:37.449
ORDINANCE AND SO FORTH.

02:12:37.516 --> 02:12:38.750
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT ARE THE

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:40.085
CITY'S -- HOW IS NEW YORK AND

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:42.087
OTHER ONES WHO HAVE THE SIMILAR

02:12:42.154 --> 02:12:44.523
PROVISIONS -- TODAY'S HERE

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:46.491
DEMANDED THAT I'M NOT SURE ANY A

02:12:46.558 --> 02:12:48.727
SPIKE IN TERMS OF DO YOU EYES OR

02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:49.861
ACCIDENTS OR THINGS OF THAT

02:12:49.928 --> 02:12:52.030
NATURE WELL -- SO A COUPLE

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:54.533
THINGS -- THERE ARE -- WE HAD --

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:56.835
AND WE DID THIS TWO YEARS AGO WE

02:12:56.902 --> 02:12:58.737
GAVE IT TO THE COMMITTEE -- WE

02:12:58.804 --> 02:13:00.205
TOOK ALL FIFTY STATES AND LOOKED

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:02.507
AT AND COMPARE CLOSING TIME TO

02:13:02.574 --> 02:13:04.976
RATES OF DO YOU Y. COLLISIONS --

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:06.578
AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO

02:13:06.645 --> 02:13:07.746
CORRELATION THERE WERE SOME OF

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:10.415
THE EARLIEST CLOSING TIME STATES.

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:12.751
THAT HAD HIGH LEVELS OF THE

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:13.585
WIVES AND SOME OF THE LATEST

02:13:13.652 --> 02:13:16.288
ONES THAT HAVE LOWER LEVELS --

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:18.557
AND SO I DON'T THINK I I DON'T

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:20.659
THINK IT'S ACCURATE -- TO

02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:22.728
SUGGEST THAT THERE'S SOMEHOW

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:28.800
THIS JUST EXACT CORRELATION AND

02:13:28.867 --> 02:13:31.002
AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE.

02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:32.204
ON PORTS AND I SAY THIS AS

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.739
SOMEONE WHO AND I'VE SAID THIS

02:13:33.805 --> 02:13:34.373
TO THIS COMMITTEE REPORT IS A

02:13:34.439 --> 02:13:35.006
HARD THING TALK ABOUT WHEN I WAS

02:13:35.073 --> 02:13:35.374
SIX YEARS OLD.

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.209
MY AUNT MY FATHER'S ONLY SIBLING

02:13:37.275 --> 02:13:39.411

02:13:39.478 --> 02:13:41.446
IT HAS RACKED OUR FAMILY FOR

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:42.814
YEARS IT STILL SOME AS WITH US

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:44.116
TODAY THIS IS AN ISSUE I TAKE

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:46.685
VERY VERY SERIOUSLY.

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:51.189
AND SHE WAS KILLED -- IN THE

02:13:51.256 --> 02:13:53.191
EARLY EVENING -- THAT WE KNOW

02:13:53.258 --> 02:13:54.025
THAT.

02:13:54.092 --> 02:13:55.327
THE BAR IS A NIGHT CLUBS ARE NOT

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:56.962
THE ONLY SOURCES OF ALCOHOL

02:13:57.028 --> 02:13:57.796
LATIMES WE'RE GOING TO LIQUOR

02:13:57.863 --> 02:13:59.197
STORES LIQUOR STORES ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THIS BILL THEY WERE

02:14:01.032 --> 02:14:02.401
EXCLUDED.

02:14:02.467 --> 02:14:07.005
FROM THIS BILL -- AND SO -- WE

02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:08.740
ARE WHEN IT COMES TO TO DO YOU

02:14:08.807 --> 02:14:10.742
EYES -- YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT

02:14:10.809 --> 02:14:12.677
IT IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY

02:14:12.744 --> 02:14:15.914
ALMOST HALF THE STATES ALLOW.

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:17.616
STATE WIDER LOCALLY LATER

02:14:17.682 --> 02:14:19.451
SERVICE TIME -- WE DON'T THINK

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:21.153
THE EVIDENCE IS THERE THERE IS

02:14:21.219 --> 02:14:22.554
THIS REPORT THAT ALCOHOL JUSTICE

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:23.822
JUST RELEASE IT'S AN ALCOHOL

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:25.724
JUSTICE REPORT THIS IS NOT SOME

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:27.225
INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY.

02:14:27.292 --> 02:14:28.627
PUTTING OUT THE REPORT THE POINT

02:14:28.693 --> 02:14:31.062
OF THIS BILL DID ITS OWN REPORT

02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:31.963
AND RELEASED IT.

02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:33.665

SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA IS

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:48.914
COMPARABLE TO NETHERLANDS OR

02:14:48.980 --> 02:14:52.717
ICELAND -- I THINK DOESN'T MAKE

02:14:52.784 --> 02:14:55.454
ANY SENSE.

IN MOST FOLKS TAKE THE FREEWAYS

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:26.912

SO DRIVERS OTHER CITIES THAT

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:55.941

THE THIRD DID YOU SAY THIRD

02:17:29.741 --> 02:17:30.875

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:42.487
FROM MY THREE COLLEAGUES WHO

02:17:42.554 --> 02:17:44.656
HAVE SERVED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:48.660
SHOULD -- GIVE EVERYONE PIES --

02:17:48.727 --> 02:17:50.495
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ECONOMICS OF

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:52.230
COURSE DON'T I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:53.298
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN ANY

02:17:53.365 --> 02:17:54.899
COMMUNITY TO HAVE THESE EXTENDED

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:57.502
HOURS AND LONGER HOURS FOR

02:17:57.569 --> 02:17:58.670
PEOPLE TO WORK BY.

02:17:58.737 --> 02:18:00.105
I DO THINK THAT THE WITNESSES

02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:01.473
BRING UP A GOOD POINT WHICH IS

02:18:01.539 --> 02:18:05.076
AT WHAT COST -- WE KNOW THAT IN

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:07.345
SOME OF THE CITIES THE D. Y.

02:18:07.412 --> 02:18:08.947
HAVE GONE UP SOME HAVE GONE DOWN

02:18:09.014 --> 02:18:09.981
IT SEEMS TO BURY THERE DOESN'T

02:18:10.048 --> 02:18:11.316
SEEM TO BE A RHYME OR REASON

02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:12.250
WITH THAT.

02:18:12.317 --> 02:18:15.220
BUT WHAT WE ALSO NOW IS THAT --

02:18:15.286 --> 02:18:17.489

YOU KNOW COMPACT WHERE YOU MAY

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:24.763
NOT HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE DRIVING

02:18:24.829 --> 02:18:26.398
BUT MORE PEOPLE WALKING I THINK

02:18:26.464 --> 02:18:28.299
YOU ADD. TO THAT EQUATION THE

02:18:28.366 --> 02:18:29.901
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MAY VERY

02:18:29.968 --> 02:18:32.137
WELL FIND THEMSELVES GETTING HIT

02:18:32.203 --> 02:18:34.305
BY A CAR BECAUSE ARE STUMBLING

02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:35.640
YOU KNOW INTO THE STREET OR

02:18:35.707 --> 02:18:36.641
MINUTES A WHOLE HOST OF

02:18:36.708 --> 02:18:38.510
SCENARIOS HERE THAT WE CAN GET.

02:18:38.576 --> 02:18:43.982
BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT -- TWO

02:18:44.049 --> 02:18:49.254
MONTHS AGO -- WE BURIED CHP

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.823
OFFICER STEVE LIKE ON HE WAS HAD

02:18:51.890 --> 02:18:54.025
BY SOMEONE WHO IS DRUNK.

02:18:54.092 --> 02:18:56.327
I DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE AGAIN

02:18:56.394 --> 02:18:58.263
I KNOW YOU DON'T EITHER.

02:18:58.329 --> 02:18:59.531
AND I SEE THIS POLICY IS

02:18:59.597 --> 02:19:01.499
SOMETHING THAT.

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:05.670
IS GOING TO ADD. TO THAT ISSUE

02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:07.839
RATHER THAN IMPROVE IT.

02:19:07.906 --> 02:19:10.842
I'M ALL FOR HAVING A DRINK.

02:19:10.909 --> 02:19:11.843

WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE.

02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:15.447
BUT I DON'T SEE THE HELP AND

02:19:15.513 --> 02:19:16.848
EXTENDING THE NUMBER OF HOURS OR

02:19:16.915 --> 02:19:18.983
PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND DRINK TOO

02:19:19.050 --> 02:19:21.019
MUCH AND THEN GET ON THE ROAD.

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:22.954
AND TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE MY

02:19:23.021 --> 02:19:25.657
DAUGHTERS OR YOU.

02:19:25.724 --> 02:19:27.926
OR ANOTHER CHP OFFICER I THINK

02:19:27.992 --> 02:19:29.961
THE NUMBER OF HOURS DURING WHICH

02:19:30.028 --> 02:19:33.431
ONE CAN DRINK IN A TWENTY FOUR

02:19:33.498 --> 02:19:35.600
APPEARED IN CALIFORNIA -- IS

02:19:35.667 --> 02:19:37.368
ENOUGH SO I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.604
SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY.

HAS HAD A HARD HARD -- PROBLEM

02:19:56.221 --> 02:20:00.125
WITH ALCOHOL -- IF YOU ALL

02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:01.793
GOALIE BACK EVEN TO THE

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.361
TEMPERANCE PROHIBITION TIME.

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:05.096
WHERE WOMEN?

02:20:05.163 --> 02:20:06.364
MAINLY BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC

02:20:06.431 --> 02:20:08.700
VIOLENCE BECAUSE OF DRINKING.

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:10.635
DURING THAT TIME PEOPLE USED TO

02:20:10.702 --> 02:20:12.670
VOTE IN BARS.

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:14.806
IT WOULD HAVE MEETINGS AND AND

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:16.107
DRINKING WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:20:16.174 --> 02:20:18.009
JUST DONE AT WORK ON A REGULAR

02:20:18.076 --> 02:20:18.943
BASIS.

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:20.745
AND AS A COUNTRY.

02:20:20.812 --> 02:20:22.714
WE DECIDED THAT MAY BE THE

02:20:22.781 --> 02:20:25.617
SOLUTION WOULD BE TO BAN ALL

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:27.519
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION.

02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:28.453
WHICH LEAD.

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:30.555
TO PROHIBITION.

02:20:30.622 --> 02:20:32.791
WHICH DIDN'T LEAD TO RISE OF

02:20:32.857 --> 02:20:34.292
SPEAKEASY'S UNDERGROUND DRINKING

02:20:34.359 --> 02:20:35.894
IT DIDN'T STOP.

02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:38.296
IN SOME INSTANCES IT PROBABLY

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:39.430
MADE IT WORSE THE MORE YOU

02:20:39.497 --> 02:20:40.965
PROHIBIT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET

02:20:41.032 --> 02:20:42.867
TO THE WHOLE ROUTE.

02:20:42.934 --> 02:20:45.904
OF ALCOHOLISM -- IT'S NOT THE

02:20:45.970 --> 02:20:47.038
BAR THREE ALCOHOL [inaudible]

02:20:47.105 --> 02:20:53.545
AND FOR ME -- IT'S REALLY ABOUT

02:20:53.611 --> 02:20:55.180
LOCAL CONTROL SOME GLAD YOU.

02:20:55.246 --> 02:20:58.483
EXPLAINED THAT -- FOR ME I'VE

02:20:58.550 --> 02:21:01.753
BEEN TO LOUISIANA -- I'VE BEEN

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:02.720

EVEN DRIVE TO ADAPT REPLACE IN

02:21:05.757 --> 02:21:07.692
YOUR CAR.

02:21:07.759 --> 02:21:09.227
AND GET A DRINK.

02:21:09.294 --> 02:21:11.696
AND I KNOW THAT IN LOUISIANA

02:21:11.763 --> 02:21:13.131
THEY'VE EVEN HAD TO HAVE

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:14.766
PROHIBITION BASED ON FEDERAL

02:21:14.833 --> 02:21:17.702
REGULATIONS TO PROHIBIT A LOT OF

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:18.770
THE DRINKING THAT'S GOING ON

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.238
HERE -- YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A

02:21:20.305 --> 02:21:21.639
LITTLE OUT OF OUR CONTROL BUT

02:21:21.706 --> 02:21:22.707
STE.

02:21:22.774 --> 02:21:23.942
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LOCAL

02:21:24.008 --> 02:21:24.509
CONTROL YOU HAVE CITIES AYE

02:21:24.576 --> 02:21:26.244
BATON ROUGE?

02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:27.879
THAT DOESN'T.

02:21:27.946 --> 02:21:30.882
ALLOW DRINKING.

02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:31.883
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ANYONE IS

02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:33.585
CONFINED TO A CERTAIN PLACE SO I

02:21:33.651 --> 02:21:35.486
TRULY BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL

02:21:35.553 --> 02:21:37.055
ESPECIALLY SOMEONE FROM SOUTH

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.356
LOS ANGELES.

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:41.526
WHERE WE DIDN'T APPLY GOOD?

02:21:41.593 --> 02:21:43.928
RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH

02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:46.397
CONTRIBUTE -- TO PROLIFERATION

02:21:46.464 --> 02:21:49.400
OF LIQUOR STORES IN MY CAN BE --

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:52.904
AND THAT'S WITH EIGHT TWO AM ONE

02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:56.474
THIRTY TWO AM -- PROHIBITION AND

02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:57.809
SO WE NEVER REALLY STOPPED --

02:21:57.876 --> 02:22:01.112
FROM DRINKING -- A DRINKING

02:22:01.179 --> 02:22:02.947
AFTER HOURS AND YOU SEE SOME OF

02:22:03.014 --> 02:22:06.584
THAT DATA GOES BEYOND THAT TIME.

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:08.453
AND SO FOR ME -- WHY THIS IS

02:22:08.519 --> 02:22:10.421
IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD

02:22:10.488 --> 02:22:11.823
WITH THIS?

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.792
IS THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF LOCAL

02:22:14.859 --> 02:22:19.063
CONTROL -- I DON'T EXPECT.

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:21.132
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.

02:22:21.199 --> 02:22:22.600
ESPECIALLY I KNOW TO COUNSEL

02:26:14.132 --> 02:26:14.765
PATROL WHICH IS COMMENDABLE

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:15.399
BECAUSE I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE

02:26:15.466 --> 02:26:16.200
TO MITIGATE.

02:26:16.267 --> 02:26:16.701

02:26:28.980 --> 02:26:31.115
GOING TO BE MUCH BUSIER -- IF

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:32.483
THIS BILL DOES PASS AND IT IT

TRAGEDY AND AS WE TALK ABOUT.

02:26:38.756 --> 02:26:39.824
LOCAL CONTROL AND WHAT THAT

02:26:39.891 --> 02:26:40.625

02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:49.800

02:26:54.338 --> 02:26:56.274
IT WILL LEAD TO NEEDLESS DEATH

02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:57.775
AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT

02:26:57.842 --> 02:26:59.377

02:58:40.643 --> 02:58:42.311
THIS BILL IS THE MOST

02:58:42.378 --> 02:58:44.046
COMPREHENSIVE THING THAT THIS

02:58:44.113 --> 02:58:46.082
LEGISLATIVE BODIES TRY TO DO ON

02:58:46.148 --> 02:58:46.749
THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO

02:58:46.816 --> 02:58:47.650
YOU.

02:58:47.716 --> 02:58:48.717
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE THING

02:58:48.784 --> 02:58:50.586
THAT ANY LEGISLATIVE BODY HAS

02:58:50.653 --> 02:58:51.587
TRIED TO DO.

02:58:51.654 --> 02:58:54.356
MORE THAN CONGRESS IS DONE MORE

02:58:54.423 --> 02:58:54.790
THAN ANY OTHER STATE

02:58:54.857 --> 02:58:56.592
LEGISLATURES DONE.

02:58:56.659 --> 02:58:59.328
WE HAVE WORK TO DO. TO REFINE

02:58:59.395 --> 02:59:00.830
THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL.

02:59:00.896 --> 02:59:03.466
BUT LET'S NOT MAKE THE PERFECT

02:59:03.532 --> 02:59:05.401
THE ENEMY THE A GOOD OF THE GOOD

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:07.203
WE'VE GOT A CHANCE. TO MAKE A

02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:10.473
REAL DENT IN THIS EPIDEMIC AND I

02:59:10.539 --> 02:59:13.042
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR.

02:59:13.109 --> 02:59:17.680
GO AHEAD MR GRAY.

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:20.015
THIS CHAIR THANK YOU WERE.

02:59:20.082 --> 02:59:22.485
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO

02:59:22.551 --> 02:59:25.054
MAKE A SPECIAL INTRODUCTION. FOR

02:59:25.121 --> 02:59:26.989
ONE OF OUR SUPPORTERS HERE TODAY.

02:59:27.056 --> 02:59:28.491
THIS IS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST

02:59:28.557 --> 02:59:30.726
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I'VE MET IN

02:59:30.793 --> 02:59:32.962
RECENT MEMORY.

02:59:33.028 --> 02:59:35.097
RON AT THE KNOCK IS GOING INTO

02:59:35.164 --> 02:59:36.866
HER SOPHOMORE YEAR MODESTO HIGH

02:59:36.932 --> 02:59:38.467
SCHOOL MY DISTRICT.

02:59:38.534 --> 02:59:40.469
SHE WROTE AN OP ED LAST MONTH

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:41.270
WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN MODESTO

02:59:41.337 --> 02:59:43.105
BEE THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION

02:59:43.172 --> 02:59:44.807
DESCRIBING HER EXPERIENCE AS A

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:46.075
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

02:59:46.142 --> 02:59:48.410
SEEING THE UPSURGE IN VAPING

02:59:48.477 --> 02:59:50.212
AMONG HER CLASSMATES.

02:59:50.279 --> 02:59:51.680
HER OP ED WAS WELL RESEARCHED.

02:59:51.747 --> 02:59:53.282
INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT AND

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:55.284
PRAGMATIC.

02:59:55.351 --> 02:59:57.586
I ADVISED HER TODAY -- HERE.

02:59:57.653 --> 02:59:59.421
TODAY TO GIVE HER FIRST HAND

02:59:59.488 --> 03:00:01.290
ACCOUNT OF THIS ISSUE AND INFORM

03:00:01.357 --> 03:00:02.625
THE COMMITTEE OF THE REAL WORLD

03:00:02.691 --> 03:00:04.059
PROBLEM WE'RE FACING FROM THE

03:00:04.126 --> 03:00:06.662
PERSPECTIVE OF YOUNG PERSON --

03:00:06.729 --> 03:00:07.296
DEALING WITH THIS EVERY DAY SO

03:00:07.363 --> 03:00:08.397
WITH THAT.

03:00:08.464 --> 03:00:10.933
RUN A PLEASE -- PRESENT YOUR

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:11.667
TESTIMONY.

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:13.669
GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME

03:00:13.736 --> 03:00:15.004
IS RON ABANDONED BECAUSE I'M A

03:00:15.070 --> 03:00:16.839
CONSTITUENT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:00:16.906 --> 03:00:18.507
ADAM GRAY.

03:00:18.574 --> 03:00:19.708
AND A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

03:00:19.775 --> 03:00:21.644
MODESTO HIGH SCHOOL I SUPPORT

03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:22.912
THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE

03:00:22.978 --> 03:00:25.147
OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON

03:00:25.214 --> 03:00:26.649
ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES DEMAND

03:00:26.715 --> 03:00:27.716
REFORM.

03:00:27.783 --> 03:00:29.385
AS A TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL

03:00:29.451 --> 03:00:30.953
STUDENT MYSELF I HAVE THE UNIQUE

03:00:31.020 --> 03:00:32.488
PERSPECTIVE OF WITNESSING

03:00:32.555 --> 03:00:34.823
FIRSTHAND ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE

03:00:34.890 --> 03:00:36.559
EPIDEMIC IN TODAY'S YOUTH.

03:00:36.625 --> 03:00:38.894
I PERSONALLY KNOW TEENAGERS WHO

03:00:38.961 --> 03:00:40.829
HAVE GONE TO STORES AND ASKED TO

03:00:40.896 --> 03:00:42.131
BUY YOU CIGARETTES.

03:00:42.198 --> 03:00:43.332
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE

03:00:43.399 --> 03:00:44.900
CASHIER SAID TO THEM.

03:00:44.967 --> 03:00:48.037
THEY SAID HOW WILL YOU BE PAYING

03:00:48.103 --> 03:00:48.771
TODAY.

03:00:48.837 --> 03:00:49.538
SCENARIOS LIKE THESE WHICH

03:00:49.605 --> 03:00:52.074
HAPPENED FAR TOO OFTEN VIVIDLY

03:00:52.141 --> 03:00:53.742
HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

03:00:53.809 --> 03:00:55.544
HAVE WITH EASE CIGARETTE

03:00:55.611 --> 03:00:57.947
REGULATION. TO BE ON WITH NO ID

03:00:58.013 --> 03:01:00.015
WAS ASKED WHY WOULD DAY THE

03:01:00.082 --> 03:01:01.317
CLERK KNOWS OF THE E. CIGARETTE

03:01:01.383 --> 03:01:04.019
MARKET IS SATURATED WITH MINORS.

03:01:04.086 --> 03:01:05.621
NO ONE IS THERE TO CATCH THEM IN

03:01:05.688 --> 03:01:06.789
THE FINE FOR DOING SO IS

03:01:06.855 --> 03:01:08.757
MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE

03:01:08.824 --> 03:01:10.359
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY

03:01:10.426 --> 03:01:11.660
COULD BE MAKING.

03:01:11.727 --> 03:01:13.896
SO THEY SELF IN FACT A RECENT

03:01:13.963 --> 03:01:16.799
SURVEY SHOWED THAT 74% OF TEENS

03:01:16.865 --> 03:01:17.800
USERS.

03:01:17.866 --> 03:01:19.868
SIMPLY PURCHASED THIRD TOOL AT A

03:01:19.935 --> 03:01:21.570
RETAIL LOCATION.

03:01:21.637 --> 03:01:23.072
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

03:01:23.138 --> 03:01:24.506
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS

03:01:24.573 --> 03:01:26.308
BILL TACKLES HEAD ON BECAUSE IT

03:01:26.375 --> 03:01:28.377
MANDATES MORE DECOYS STING

03:01:28.444 --> 03:01:29.945
OPERATIONS IN INCREASES THE

03:01:30.012 --> 03:01:31.747
PENALTY FOR STORES THAT DO SELL

03:01:31.814 --> 03:01:32.715
TO MINORS.

03:01:32.781 --> 03:01:34.216
SO THEY WILL GET CAUGHT AND

03:01:34.283 --> 03:01:34.950
LEARN THEIR LESSON THE FIRST

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:35.985
TIME.

03:01:36.051 --> 03:01:37.853
WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SEND A

03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:39.488
STRONG SIGNAL TO THE STORES SO

03:01:39.555 --> 03:01:40.689
THAT CHILDREN DON'T GET THEIR

03:01:40.756 --> 03:01:42.191
HANDS ON THESE PRODUCTS IN THE

03:01:42.258 --> 03:01:43.425
FIRST PLACE.

03:01:43.492 --> 03:01:45.527
I ALSO SUPPORT THE LIMITATION OF

03:01:45.594 --> 03:01:47.129
THE SALE OF FLAVOR PRODUCTS AND

03:01:47.196 --> 03:01:49.598
ALL STORES ACCEPT TOBACCO SHOPS.

03:01:49.665 --> 03:01:50.799
THIS WILL TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE

03:01:50.866 --> 03:01:53.235
INCENTIVE FOR TEENAGERS TO SMOKE

03:01:53.302 --> 03:01:54.737
AS IT'S NO SECRET THAT THESE

03:01:54.803 --> 03:01:57.339
FLAVORS DIRECTLY FEEL TO

03:01:57.406 --> 03:01:57.973
CHILDREN.

03:01:58.040 --> 03:01:59.742
ALTHOUGH SOME MAY ACTIVELY PUSH

03:01:59.808 --> 03:02:01.577
FOR A COMPLETE BAN OF ALL FLEA

03:02:01.644 --> 03:02:03.612
RUDY CIGARETTE PRODUCTS I DO NOT

03:02:03.679 --> 03:02:04.813
BELIEVE THAT THIS APPROACH WOULD

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.148
BE EFFECTIVE IN SOLVING THE

03:02:06.215 --> 03:02:08.651
PROBLEM. TO PUT IT SIMPLY THE

03:02:08.717 --> 03:02:10.286
FLAVORS ARE A BIG PART OF THE

03:02:10.352 --> 03:02:11.654
REASON WHY EASE CIGARETTE

03:02:11.720 --> 03:02:13.255
CONSUMPTION RATES AMONG TEENS

03:02:13.322 --> 03:02:14.290
ARE HIGH.

03:02:14.356 --> 03:02:16.358
HOWEVER THAT IS NOT WHAT KEEPS

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:17.693
SCENES COMING.

03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:18.594
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT

03:02:18.661 --> 03:02:20.829
THE MAIN REASON WHY TEENS VAPOR

03:02:20.896 --> 03:02:22.831
JEWEL IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS

03:02:22.898 --> 03:02:23.966
IDEA IN THEIR HEAD.

03:02:24.033 --> 03:02:25.467
BUT IT'S COOL.

03:02:25.534 --> 03:02:27.403
THEY SEE IT ALL OVER SOCIAL

03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:30.372
MEDIA ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAVE.

03:02:30.439 --> 03:02:32.141
ONE AND THE PEER PRESSURE JUST

03:02:32.207 --> 03:02:33.842
BECOMES UNBEARABLE.

03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:35.277
SO THEY BY ONE THEMSELVES AND

03:02:35.344 --> 03:02:37.579
POST ABOUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

03:02:37.646 --> 03:02:39.181
TO SOMEONE ELSE USE THEIR STORY

03:02:39.248 --> 03:02:41.383
BECOMES INFLUENCED BY SOMEONE IN

03:02:41.450 --> 03:02:42.918
THE CYCLE JUST CONTINUES AND

03:02:42.985 --> 03:02:44.119
CONTINUES.

03:02:44.186 --> 03:02:46.221
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN FIRSTHAND TO

03:02:46.288 --> 03:02:47.690
PEOPLE I KNOW.

03:02:47.756 --> 03:02:49.558
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST

03:02:49.625 --> 03:02:51.327
LOOK ONLINE.

03:02:51.393 --> 03:02:53.362
AND ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY

03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:55.664
81% OF U. S. ONLINE CONSUMER

03:02:55.731 --> 03:02:57.466
PURCHASING DECISIONS ARE

03:02:57.533 --> 03:02:59.368
INFLUENCED BY THEIR FRIENDS

03:02:59.435 --> 03:03:02.004
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS -- ALSO FOUR

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:04.173
TIMES AS LIKELY TO BUY A PRODUCT

03:03:04.239 --> 03:03:05.641
BECAUSE THEY WERE REFERRED TO IT

03:03:05.708 --> 03:03:06.775
BY A FRIEND.

03:03:06.842 --> 03:03:09.311
PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND YOU

03:03:09.378 --> 03:03:10.612
HAVE AN EPIDEMIC ON YOUR HANDS.

03:03:10.679 --> 03:03:12.548
SO HOW DO WE STOP TEENS FROM

03:03:12.614 --> 03:03:14.083
USING E. CIGARETTES.

03:03:14.149 --> 03:03:15.384
WE MAKE THEM DIFFICULT TO

03:03:15.451 --> 03:03:17.786
PURCHASE THE SAME LOGIC APPLIES

03:03:17.853 --> 03:03:19.988
TO ALCOHOL YOU ALL BETTER THAN I

03:03:20.055 --> 03:03:21.357
KNOW HOW MANY FUNDS RINGS IN

03:03:21.423 --> 03:03:23.625
FLAVORS OF ALCOHOL THERE ARE.

03:03:23.692 --> 03:03:25.761
IN THE PAST MANY TEENS LEGALLY

03:03:25.828 --> 03:03:28.030
DRINK ALCOHOL AND WE EVEN TRIED

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:31.233
TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL IN AN ATTEMPT

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:32.801
TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH.

03:03:32.868 --> 03:03:35.170
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT DIDN'T

03:03:35.237 --> 03:03:36.405
WORK OUT VERY WELL.

03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:37.740
BUT NOW RATES ARE FINALLY

03:03:37.806 --> 03:03:38.841
DECLINING.

03:03:38.907 --> 03:03:40.476
SO WHAT DID WE DO.

03:03:40.542 --> 03:03:42.344
WE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

03:03:42.411 --> 03:03:44.046
PURCHASE.

03:03:44.113 --> 03:03:45.514
AND IT LOST ITS POPULARITY.

03:03:45.581 --> 03:03:46.949
THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT

03:03:47.015 --> 03:03:49.284
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BUT RATHER

03:03:49.351 --> 03:03:50.819
DIRECTLY CORRELATED.

03:03:50.886 --> 03:03:52.554
SAME WITH CIGARETTES THEY USED

03:03:52.621 --> 03:03:55.391
TO BE WILDLY POPULAR AMONG TEENS

03:03:55.457 --> 03:03:56.825
BUT NOW RATES ARE DECLINING.

03:03:56.892 --> 03:03:59.128
SO WHAT DID WE DO WE MADE THEM

03:03:59.194 --> 03:04:01.130
DIFFICULT TO ACCESS IN EDUCATED

03:04:01.196 --> 03:04:02.564
TEENS ABOUT.

03:04:02.631 --> 03:04:05.934
THE DETRIMENTS THAT TOBACCO FACE

03:04:06.001 --> 03:04:06.635
THAT TOBACCO.

03:04:06.702 --> 03:04:08.437
HAS TO THEIR HOUSE.

03:04:08.504 --> 03:04:09.772
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL

03:04:09.838 --> 03:04:11.840
DOES IT GIVES A REASON FOR BOTH

03:04:11.907 --> 03:04:13.108
RETAILERS TO STOP SELLING TO

03:04:13.175 --> 03:04:15.411
MINORS AND FOR MINORS TO STOP

03:04:15.477 --> 03:04:16.945
SMOKING E. CIGARETTES.

03:04:17.012 --> 03:04:18.480
SEE EVEN IF WE BANNED ALL

03:04:18.547 --> 03:04:20.482
FLAVORS WHAT ABOUT THE MILLIONS

03:04:20.549 --> 03:04:21.850
OF TEAMS THAT ARE ALREADY

03:04:21.917 --> 03:04:23.185
ADDICTED.

03:04:23.252 --> 03:04:24.420
BILL JUST SWITCH THE FLAVORLESS

03:04:24.486 --> 03:04:26.722
PRODUCTS CONSIDERING HOW MUCH

03:04:26.789 --> 03:04:28.690
ADDICTIVE NICOTINE IS IN THESE

03:04:28.757 --> 03:04:31.360
EASE CIGARETTES THEY WILL DO

03:04:31.427 --> 03:04:32.594
ANYTHING FOR THEIR FIX.

03:04:32.661 --> 03:04:33.796
AND THEIR FRIENDS WILL STILL

03:04:33.862 --> 03:04:35.531
FEEL THE SAME PEER PRESSURE AS

03:04:35.597 --> 03:04:37.032
THEY DID BEFORE.

03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:38.934
BUT IF WE ATTACK THIS PROBLEM

03:04:39.001 --> 03:04:40.235
FROM ITS SOURCE AND MAKE IT

03:04:40.302 --> 03:04:42.004
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR TEENS TO

03:04:42.070 --> 03:04:42.871
ACCESS.

03:04:42.938 --> 03:04:44.139
THIS TOO WILL LOSE ITS

03:04:44.206 --> 03:04:45.808
POPULARITY.

03:04:45.874 --> 03:04:48.043
AND I KNOW THAT THESE BILLS MAY

03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:49.711
NOT BE PERFECT FOR EVERYONE.

03:04:49.778 --> 03:04:51.814
BUT IT MAKES PROGRESS IT HAS THE

03:04:51.880 --> 03:04:53.715
POTENTIAL TO PROTECT MILLIONS OF

03:04:53.782 --> 03:04:54.416
TEENS.

03:04:54.483 --> 03:04:55.717
AND THAT'S INVALUABLE

03:04:55.784 --> 03:04:57.386
CONSIDERING THAT AS EVERYDAY

03:04:57.453 --> 03:04:58.587
PASSES.

03:04:58.654 --> 03:05:00.189

IN THE STATE -- WE'RE KIND OF IN

03:23:05.239 --> 03:23:06.474
A TWEENER POSITION WE THINK

03:23:06.541 --> 03:23:07.942
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN

03:23:08.009 --> 03:23:09.076
THIS BILL ESPECIALLY AROUND

ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES WHICH

03:23:10.845 --> 03:23:11.846
WE KNOW IS A GOOD.

03:23:11.913 --> 03:23:14.682
WAY AT CURBING -- TEEN ACCESS AS

03:23:14.749 --> 03:23:17.084
WE KNOW 7580% OF MINERS THAT

03:23:17.151 --> 03:23:18.352
OBTAIN VAPES GET IT FROM

03:23:18.419 --> 03:23:19.487
SOMEBODY THAT'S TWENTY ONE OR

03:23:19.554 --> 03:23:21.055
OVER THREE STOP PURCHASING SO WE

03:23:21.122 --> 03:23:22.557
THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE

03:23:22.623 --> 03:23:23.524
APPROACH.

03:23:23.591 --> 03:23:24.959
TO CURBING THAT WE WOULD PUSH

03:23:25.026 --> 03:23:26.093
BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE

03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:28.729
COMMENTS THAT 70% OF OF TEENS

03:23:28.796 --> 03:23:30.264
ARE PURCHASING THESE PRODUCTS

03:23:30.331 --> 03:23:31.566
ILLEGALLY FROM OUR STORES

03:23:36.103 --> 03:23:38.105
AT RESTRICTING MINORS TO AGE

VERIFIED -- GREAT RESTRICTED

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:41.709

03:23:41.776 --> 03:23:43.444
WE HAVE -- A LONGSTANDING

03:23:43.511 --> 03:23:45.379
HISTORY OF BEING AT THE FRONT

03:23:45.446 --> 03:23:47.415
LINES TO PREVENT MINORS FROM

03:23:47.481 --> 03:23:49.850
THESE -- PRODUCTS AND WE THINK

03:23:49.917 --> 03:23:53.154
THAT THE INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY --

03:23:53.220 --> 03:23:55.990
VERIFICATION AS WELL AS THE

03:23:56.057 --> 03:23:56.958

OUR FOLKS IS GOING A LONG WAY

03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:01.762
AND AND NOT PREVENTING -- MORE

03:24:01.829 --> 03:24:04.098
YOUTH ACCESS AND SO WE DO HAVE

03:24:04.165 --> 03:24:05.199
AN ISSUE WITH THE TWENTY ONE AND

03:24:05.266 --> 03:24:06.934
OVER -- FLAVOR CIGARETTES

03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:35.462
DOWN ON THOSE WHO ARE SELLING TO

03:39:35.529 --> 03:39:36.563

ADVERTISING I MEAN I YOU KNOW

03:39:46.273 --> 03:39:47.641
THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY CLEARLY

03:39:47.707 --> 03:39:49.709
EASING CARTOONS AND AND THINGS

03:39:49.776 --> 03:39:53.179
LIKE THAT ARE CLEARLY TRYING TO

03:39:53.246 --> 03:39:53.413
TARGET.

03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:54.147
USE.

03:39:54.214 --> 03:39:54.915
I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD

03:39:54.981 --> 03:39:56.516
PROVISIONS BUT I DO BELIEVE

03:39:56.583 --> 03:39:58.718
FUNDAMENTALLY THAT ADULTS SHOULD

03:39:58.785 --> 03:40:01.555
BE ABLE TO MAKE ADULT DECISIONS.

03:40:01.621 --> 03:40:03.189
AND I KNOW THAT.

03:40:03.256 --> 03:40:04.157
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIGURE OUT

03:40:04.224 --> 03:40:05.825
WHAT AN ADULT IS ANYMORE

03:40:05.892 --> 03:40:07.494
ESPECIALLY IN THIS BUILDING --

03:40:07.561 --> 03:40:12.332
BECAUSE LET ME.

03:40:12.399 --> 03:40:14.067
I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO

03:40:14.134 --> 03:40:15.235
HAVING THE NEXT QUESTION LET ME.

03:40:15.302 --> 03:40:17.904
LET ME CLARIFY BECAUSE IN THIS

03:40:17.971 --> 03:40:24.811
CONTEXT THAT'S YOU'RE AN ADULT

03:40:24.878 --> 03:40:25.111
IF YOU'RE.

03:40:25.178 --> 03:40:26.713
TWENTY ONE RIGHT.

03:40:26.780 --> 03:40:28.381
ANOTHER BILL THIS YEAR.

03:40:28.448 --> 03:40:29.783
IS PROPOSING A THE VOTING AGE TO

03:40:29.849 --> 03:40:30.884
BE SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW SO

03:40:30.951 --> 03:40:32.485
APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT ADULT

03:40:32.552 --> 03:40:34.354
ENOUGH TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

03:40:34.421 --> 03:40:36.323
SMOKING AND TOBACCO -- BUT YOU

03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:38.959
WELL FORMED ENOUGH TO MAKE A

03:40:39.025 --> 03:40:43.229
DECISION ABOUT GOOGLE. TO OFFICE.

03:40:43.296 --> 03:40:44.798
YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE V&lt;c.cyan&gt;ALSO&lt;/c&gt;

03:40:44.864 --> 03:40:46.766
PASSED LEGISLATION HERE THAT IF

03:40:46.833 --> 03:40:48.301
YOU COMMIT VERY SERIOUS CRIMES

03:40:48.368 --> 03:40:49.502
AGAINST PEOPLE IN YOUR TWENTY

03:40:49.569 --> 03:40:51.438
FOUR YEARS OLD -- YOU SHOULD BE

03:40:51.504 --> 03:40:53.540
TREATED AS AN ADULT BECAUSE YOU

03:40:53.607 --> 03:40:54.541
HAVE HOT BRAIN.

03:40:54.608 --> 03:40:56.343
SO YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO BE

03:40:56.409 --> 03:40:58.011
CONFUSED AROUND HERE ABOUT WHAT

03:40:58.078 --> 03:41:02.649
AN ADULT IS BUT I DIGRESS -- BUT

03:41:02.716 --> 03:41:04.117
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN YOU ARE

03:41:04.184 --> 03:41:05.552
AN ADULT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

03:41:05.619 --> 03:41:08.955
DETERMINE THAT IS I THINK IT'S

03:41:09.022 --> 03:41:09.556
EIGHTEEN WHENEVER YOU'RE AN

03:41:09.623 --> 03:41:10.657
ADULT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

03:41:10.724 --> 03:41:12.359
TO MAKE ADULT DECISIONS ABOUT

03:41:12.425 --> 03:41:13.860
WHETHER OR NOT TO USE TOBACCO

03:41:13.927 --> 03:41:15.962
AND MAYBE YOU MAYBE YOU DECIDE

03:41:16.029 --> 03:41:16.363
YOU LIKE CERTAIN.

03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:17.364
FLAVORS.

03:41:17.430 --> 03:41:20.200
OR NOT AND I THINK BY US

03:41:20.266 --> 03:41:21.768
ARBITRARILY LIMITING WHAT

03:41:21.835 --> 03:41:24.304
FLAVORS SHOULD BE OUT THERE AND

03:41:24.371 --> 03:41:24.904
SAY THERE SHOULD ONLY BE THREE

03:41:24.971 --> 03:41:27.273
IN THE WORLD. TO ME IS.

03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:29.075
YOU KNOW NOT RESPECTFUL OF THAT

03:41:29.142 --> 03:41:30.744
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE --

03:41:30.810 --> 03:41:31.845
CERTAINLY WE CAN MAKE SURE THOSE

03:41:31.911 --> 03:41:35.348
ARE TARGETED TOWARDS USE -- YOU

03:41:35.415 --> 03:41:35.815
KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT

03:41:35.882 --> 03:41:38.118
ADVERTISING THE BILL DOES THAT

03:41:38.184 --> 03:41:39.619
BUT LET ME.

03:41:39.686 --> 03:41:40.654
TO THREE YOU KNOW THREE FLAVORS

03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:42.455
TO ME I I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULD

03:41:42.522 --> 03:41:43.857
DO THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE

03:41:43.923 --> 03:41:45.525
ADULT DECISIONS.

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:46.326
AND ALSO YOU'RE LIMITING THE

03:41:46.393 --> 03:41:48.261
ABILITY THAT PEOPLE CAN AS AN

03:41:48.328 --> 03:41:49.963
ADULT AND HAVING THE RIGHT TO DO

03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:51.898
THIS.

03:41:51.965 --> 03:41:53.400
WHERE THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO A

03:41:53.466 --> 03:41:56.136
PRODUCT THAT THEY USE -- MANY

03:41:56.202 --> 03:41:57.804
PEOPLE GO TO GAS STATIONS AT THE

03:41:57.871 --> 03:41:59.973
OTHER MS STOP TO GET GAS AND

03:42:00.040 --> 03:42:00.774
THEY HAPPEN.

03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:02.409
TO YEAH PARTAKE IN THAT HABIT

03:42:02.475 --> 03:42:03.877
THAT MANY OF US THINK IS NOT

03:42:03.943 --> 03:42:04.978
GOOD FOR YOU.

03:42:05.045 --> 03:42:06.146
WE WOULD ALL SAY THAT THERE'S A

03:42:06.212 --> 03:42:08.548
LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE

03:42:08.615 --> 03:42:10.583
THAT TELLS YOU THAT -- BUT

03:42:10.650 --> 03:42:11.484
THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND WE'RE

03:42:11.551 --> 03:42:13.453
GONNA BE LIMITING THAT UNIVERSE

03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:15.088
SO I HAVE A I HAVE A PROBLEM

03:42:15.155 --> 03:42:17.057
FROM JUSTICE FUNDAMENTAL SENSE

03:42:17.123 --> 03:42:18.091
OF ADULTS.

03:42:18.158 --> 03:42:19.159
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKEADULT

03:42:19.225 --> 03:42:20.326
DECISIONS.

03:42:20.393 --> 03:42:21.594
AND THEN SECONDLY I THINK

03:42:21.661 --> 03:42:22.796
THERE'S SOME LEGITIMATE

03:42:22.862 --> 03:42:24.664
DISCUSSION HERE IT WAS REYES

03:42:24.731 --> 03:42:25.598
SAYS.

03:42:25.665 --> 03:42:27.133
THESE RESTRICTIONS ALSO SEEM TO

03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:29.102
MAYBE FAVOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES

03:42:29.169 --> 03:42:30.603
OVER OTHERS.

03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:31.738
AND I THINK THAT COULD BE

03:42:31.805 --> 03:42:33.473
PROBLEMATIC TO BECAUSE LOOK

03:42:33.540 --> 03:42:34.841
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT

03:42:34.908 --> 03:42:38.078
THERE IN THIS MARKET -- THEY MAY

03:42:38.144 --> 03:42:40.046
HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT

03:42:40.113 --> 03:42:41.281
THAT IS A MARKET I DON'T KNOW

03:42:41.347 --> 03:42:42.782
THAT WE SHOULD GET IN THE

03:42:42.849 --> 03:42:44.250
BUSINESS OF REGULATING.

03:42:44.317 --> 03:42:45.585
WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS YOU CAN

03:42:45.652 --> 03:42:47.153
HAVE?

03:42:47.220 --> 03:42:48.922
EXCEPT FOR WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

03:42:48.988 --> 03:42:50.590
LAID OUT IF YOU'RE IF YOU ARE

03:42:50.657 --> 03:42:53.359
TARGETING IN ADVERTISING TO KIDS

03:42:53.426 --> 03:42:54.994
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

03:42:55.061 --> 03:42:57.130
AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT.

03:42:57.197 --> 03:42:58.064
I THINK WE CAN DO THAT AND

03:42:58.131 --> 03:43:01.267
PROTECT USE LEGITIMATELY.

03:43:01.334 --> 03:43:03.603
WITHOUT DOING THE THE THREE

03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:05.071
FLAVORS AND THEN MAYBE MY FINAL

03:43:05.138 --> 03:43:06.039
POINT.

03:43:06.106 --> 03:43:09.042
DOES AGAIN THE YOUNG LADY FROM

03:43:09.109 --> 03:43:10.243
MODESTO HIGH GREAT JOB.

03:43:10.310 --> 03:43:12.045
BY THE WAY AND I'M GLAD YOU WERE

03:43:12.112 --> 03:43:15.248
ABLE TO GET HER HERE -- YEAH BUT

03:43:15.315 --> 03:43:17.217
THINGS AVE NOT CHANGED IT SEEMS

03:43:17.283 --> 03:43:18.118
TO ME.

03:43:18.184 --> 03:43:19.385
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT

03:43:19.452 --> 03:43:20.887
IT WAS ABOUT FLAVORED CHEWING

03:43:20.954 --> 03:43:23.223
TOBACCO RED AND?

03:43:23.289 --> 03:43:24.591
YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE THING THAT

03:43:24.657 --> 03:43:26.126
WAS GOING OUT THERE ALTHOUGH THE

03:43:26.192 --> 03:43:27.160
MARKET DID.

03:43:27.227 --> 03:43:29.462
ADDRESS THE SOMEWHAT IS IT

03:43:29.529 --> 03:43:31.364
PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY FOUND.

03:43:31.431 --> 03:43:33.566
THAT CHERRY SCHOOL.

03:43:33.633 --> 03:43:36.336
NOT A GOOD CHOICE -- ANYWAY IT'S

03:43:36.402 --> 03:43:37.804
WITH THAT I WILL I WILL IN MY

03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:39.339
POINTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY

03:43:39.405 --> 03:43:41.975
THOSE -- THOSE TWO THINGS.

03:43:42.041 --> 03:43:44.410
I THINK IF WE CAN CONSIDER THOSE

03:43:44.477 --> 03:43:46.446
IN THE FUTURE MAYBE YOU CAN

03:43:46.513 --> 03:43:48.982
RESPOND TO SIR THANK YOU --

03:43:49.048 --> 03:43:49.983
MICHIGAN ALL RIGHT I WILL.

03:43:50.049 --> 03:43:50.984
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND EXCEL

03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:54.287
YOUR THIRD QUESTION WE'RE GOING

03:43:54.354 --> 03:43:55.989
TO FOCUS ON YOUR FIRST.

03:43:56.055 --> 03:43:57.524
TWO AND THAT THE FIRST ISSUE

03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:59.125
RAISED -- WAS THIS ISSUE OF THIS

03:43:59.192 --> 03:44:00.493
INSTITUTION STRUGGLING TO FIND

03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:02.162
THE AGE OF MAJORITY AND I THINK

03:44:02.228 --> 03:44:04.164
YOU KNOW -- INPRIVATE

03:44:04.230 --> 03:44:05.698
CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND I

03:44:05.765 --> 03:44:07.500
THAT I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT

03:44:07.567 --> 03:44:09.369
SUBJECT IN FACT I THINK I'M ONE

03:44:09.435 --> 03:44:10.970
OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN MY PARTY IN

03:44:11.037 --> 03:44:12.272
THIS INSTITUTION.

03:44:12.338 --> 03:44:14.674
WHO VOTED AGAINST CHANGING --

03:44:14.741 --> 03:44:17.143
THE AGE RESTRICTION.

03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.710
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE I DID

03:44:17.777 --> 03:44:19.078
THAT BECAUSE I ARRIVE AT THE AGE

03:44:19.145 --> 03:44:21.347
OF MAJORITY AT THE AGE THAT YOU

03:44:21.414 --> 03:44:22.115
CAN ENTER THE MILITARY.

03:44:22.182 --> 03:44:23.983
FORGET ASKED YOUNG PEOPLE TO DIE

03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:25.118
FOR THIS COUNTRY THEN THEY CAN

03:44:25.185 --> 03:44:26.419
MAKE IT DON'T CHOICES THAT'S MY

03:44:26.486 --> 03:44:29.856
POSITION IT'S BEEN MY POSITION

03:44:29.923 --> 03:44:31.224
IN MY VOTING RECORD CONSISTENT.

03:44:31.291 --> 03:44:31.825
HAVING SAID THAT OTHER PEOPLE

03:44:31.891 --> 03:44:33.626
FEEL DIFFERENTLY.

03:44:33.693 --> 03:44:38.164
THIS IS A IN PERFECT BILL THAT'S

03:44:38.231 --> 03:44:39.499
A PRODUCT OF COMPROMISE RIGHT

03:44:39.566 --> 03:44:41.100
AND ALL OF US CAN TAKE OUR

03:44:41.167 --> 03:44:43.436
RESPECTIVE IDEOLOGICAL POSITION

03:44:43.503 --> 03:44:44.103
TO BE PEER.

03:44:44.170 --> 03:44:46.706
RIGHT I CAN REFUSE TO SUPPORT

03:44:46.773 --> 03:44:48.308
ANYTHING THAT ADDRESSES --

03:44:48.374 --> 03:44:50.610
SUBJECTS THAT IN OR INCONSISTENT

03:44:50.677 --> 03:44:54.514
PERHAPS MY PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT

03:44:54.581 --> 03:44:55.782
WE ALL AGREE ON A WHICH ARE

03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:57.217
BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG COLLEAGUES

03:44:57.283 --> 03:44:58.952
AND MEMBERS IN MEETINGS ON IS

03:44:59.018 --> 03:44:59.352
THAT.

03:44:59.419 --> 03:45:01.020
EVERYBODY AGREES WE'VE GOT A

03:45:01.087 --> 03:45:02.856
PROBLEM WITH TOO MANY KIDS USE

03:45:02.922 --> 03:45:04.023
THESE PRODUCTS.

03:45:04.090 --> 03:45:06.025
AND SOME HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT

03:45:06.092 --> 03:45:07.827
SO WHETHER NOT WE CAN AGREE TO

03:45:07.894 --> 03:45:09.696
BAN ALL FLAVORS OR WHETHER NOT

03:45:09.762 --> 03:45:11.664
WE CAN AGREE ON THE NUMBER OF

03:45:11.731 --> 03:45:13.299
FLAVORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE WHERE.

03:45:13.366 --> 03:45:14.634
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO GET A

03:45:14.701 --> 03:45:15.535
HANDLE ON THAT.

03:45:15.602 --> 03:45:16.936
AND I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT

03:45:17.003 --> 03:45:19.939
LICENSE BEING LICENSE TO SELL

03:45:20.006 --> 03:45:22.642
CERTAIN PRODUCTS IS A PRIVILEGE.

03:45:22.709 --> 03:45:24.510
RIGHT -- YOU MADE THE POINT

03:45:24.577 --> 03:45:26.012
WHILE YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE

03:45:26.079 --> 03:45:27.247
RESTRICT WHAT A BUSINESS CAN AND

03:45:27.313 --> 03:45:28.882
CAN'T SELL WELL.

03:45:28.948 --> 03:45:31.951
IF I WANT A BAR I CAN SELL UNCLE.

03:45:32.018 --> 03:45:33.853
IF YOUR LEMONADE STAND YOU CAN'T.

03:45:33.920 --> 03:45:34.988
WELL I'M NOT THEY THEY THEY

03:45:35.054 --> 03:45:35.889
THOSE IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS AND

03:45:35.955 --> 03:45:36.756
THEN THERE'S PUBLIC SAFETY

03:45:36.823 --> 03:45:39.325
CONCERNS -- IT INVOLVED THE WHY

03:45:39.392 --> 03:45:40.226
WE MAKE THOSE TO TRY AND THAT'S

03:45:40.293 --> 03:45:42.295
NOT ANY DIFFERENT HERE RIGHT WE

03:45:42.362 --> 03:45:43.963
HAVE LICENSE READERS NOW WORK IN

03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:45.498
THIS CASE UNDER OUR BILL GOING

03:45:45.565 --> 03:45:46.399
TO HAVE.

03:45:46.466 --> 03:45:48.668
TOBACCO ONLY VAPE SHOP LOCATIONS

03:45:48.735 --> 03:45:51.437
IT'S A SPECIAL -- PART OF THE

03:45:51.504 --> 03:45:55.341
MARKET WE'RE GONNA ALLOW ALL

03:45:55.408 --> 03:45:56.242
FLAVORS TO BE SALT.

03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:57.277
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TRADITIONAL

03:45:57.343 --> 03:45:59.078
TOBACCO WHICH IS THE THREE I

03:45:59.145 --> 03:46:00.179
THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHICH

03:46:00.246 --> 03:46:02.849
IS MEANT MENTHOL AND TRADITIONAL

03:46:02.916 --> 03:46:04.584
TOBACCO FLAVORED PRODUCTS --

03:46:04.651 --> 03:46:07.120
SOLD -- AS THEY ARE TODAY IN THE

03:46:07.186 --> 03:46:08.521
STORES WIDELY AVAILABLE CAN MEAN

03:46:08.588 --> 03:46:11.190
STORAGE GROCERY STORES IT'S

03:46:11.257 --> 03:46:12.625
CENTER.

03:46:12.692 --> 03:46:13.159
SO I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY

03:46:13.226 --> 03:46:15.261
APPROPRIATE THAT WE LIMIT THE

03:46:15.328 --> 03:46:17.630
SALE THE PRODUCTS INTO A SMALLER

03:46:17.697 --> 03:46:19.999
NUMBER OF RETAIL LOCATIONS AS IT

03:46:20.066 --> 03:46:21.567
RELATES TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE TOO

03:46:21.634 --> 03:46:22.835
OFTEN FINDING THEMSELVES IN THE

03:46:22.902 --> 03:46:23.937
HANDS OF CHILDREN.

03:46:24.003 --> 03:46:25.071
WE OBVIOUSLY TO GET A BETTER

03:46:25.138 --> 03:46:26.472
HANDLE ON IT WELL LET'S TAKE IT

03:46:26.539 --> 03:46:27.840
FROM THIRTY ONE THOUSAND LESS

03:46:27.907 --> 03:46:28.975
THAN A THOUSAND AND THEN LET'S

03:46:29.042 --> 03:46:30.176
GO TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

03:46:30.243 --> 03:46:31.144
HEALTH MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE

03:46:31.210 --> 03:46:33.079
RESOURCES AND THE TOOLS. TO

03:46:33.146 --> 03:46:34.414
PROPERLY ENGAGE IN STING

03:46:34.480 --> 03:46:36.749
OPERATIONS SO THAT WE KNOW THOSE

03:46:36.816 --> 03:46:38.518
LOCATIONS ARE NOT SO MUCH AND ON

03:46:38.584 --> 03:46:40.620
TOP OF THAT JUST LIKE A BAR

03:46:40.687 --> 03:46:41.854
LET'S REMOVE THE ABILITY OF

03:46:41.921 --> 03:46:43.623
SOMEBODY UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY

03:46:43.690 --> 03:46:44.924
ONE WHO CAN'T LEGALLY BUY A

03:46:44.991 --> 03:46:46.025
PRODUCT AND REPLACE.

03:46:46.092 --> 03:46:47.994
RIGHT YOU DON'T SEE SIXTEEN YEAR

03:46:48.061 --> 03:46:48.895
OLDS WALKING INTO BARS BECAUSE

03:46:48.962 --> 03:46:50.997
THERE'S NOTHING IN A BAR THE

03:46:51.064 --> 03:46:51.898
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CAN LEGALLY BUY

03:46:51.965 --> 03:46:52.565
RIGHT.

03:46:52.632 --> 03:46:53.433
AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY THAT THEY

03:46:53.499 --> 03:46:54.667
CAN'T BUY SOMETHING THERE BUT

03:46:54.734 --> 03:46:56.803
THEY CAN'T EVEN GO IN AND THAT'S

03:46:56.869 --> 03:46:59.138
THE THE CONSTRUCT WERE SETTING

03:46:59.205 --> 03:47:07.180
UP -- IN THIS BILL -- HI AGAIN.

03:47:07.246 --> 03:47:08.081
IS IT THE PERFECT ANSWER ALL

03:47:08.147 --> 03:47:09.782
FLAVORS -- MAYBE MAYBE NOT FOR

03:47:09.849 --> 03:47:11.484
SOME FOLKS -- YOU MISTER BERMAN

03:47:11.551 --> 03:47:12.485
ARTICULATED THAT MENTAL MEANT

03:47:12.552 --> 03:47:14.420
SOMETHING THAT IS ON HIS MIND --

03:47:14.487 --> 03:47:15.855
MISTER BONTA MAY HAVE OTHER

03:47:15.922 --> 03:47:17.156
IDEAS ON HIS MIND.

03:47:17.223 --> 03:47:20.226
BUT THE EXCUSE OF WE CAN'T AGREE

03:47:20.293 --> 03:47:22.195
ON FLAVORS -- TO NOT MOVE

03:47:22.261 --> 03:47:23.429
FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE

03:47:23.496 --> 03:47:24.597
TAKE THESE PRODUCTS IN THE

03:47:24.664 --> 03:47:25.932
ACCESS IS PRODUCTS AWAY FROM

03:47:25.999 --> 03:47:28.201
CHILDREN IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND

03:47:28.267 --> 03:47:29.469
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE ALL

03:47:29.535 --> 03:47:30.269
OUGHT TO MAKE THE NECESSARY

03:47:30.336 --> 03:47:32.305
COMPROMISES. TO GET TO A PLACE

03:47:32.372 --> 03:47:33.973
WE CAN SUPPORT A BILL THAT'S

03:47:34.040 --> 03:47:35.475
GOING TO INCREASE ENFOCEMENT IS

03:47:35.541 --> 03:47:36.542
GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS

03:47:36.609 --> 03:47:38.211
RIGHT AND WE'VE GOT A SUNSET IN

03:47:38.277 --> 03:47:39.946
HERE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO

03:47:40.013 --> 03:47:41.147
CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA WE CAN

03:47:41.214 --> 03:47:42.682
COME BACK TO THIS BODY AND IF IF

03:47:42.749 --> 03:47:44.217
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH IT'S NOT

03:47:44.283 --> 03:47:45.418
STRINGENT AFTER THIS OTHER

03:47:45.485 --> 03:47:46.652
THINGS WERE MISSING.

03:47:46.719 --> 03:47:51.024
WE WILL REVIEW WILL PUT THOSE IN

03:47:51.090 --> 03:47:53.526
PLACE.

03:47:53.593 --> 03:47:55.995
JOINT AUTHORS ON ANYTHING WELL I

03:47:56.062 --> 03:47:57.730
SHOULD.

03:47:57.797 --> 03:47:58.331
AND YOU WERE QUITE ELOQUENT

03:47:58.398 --> 03:47:59.665
MISTER GRAY BUT I DID WANT TO

03:47:59.732 --> 03:48:00.800
JUST ADD -- TO MISTER

03:48:00.867 --> 03:48:01.534
CUNNINGHAM'S POINT THAT WE

03:48:01.601 --> 03:48:02.201
SHOULD LET THE PERFECT -- BE THE

03:48:02.268 --> 03:48:03.036
ENEMY OF THE GOOD I THINK IT'S

03:48:03.102 --> 03:48:03.503
ALSO ABOUT CREATING.

03:48:03.569 --> 03:48:05.071
STEPPING STONES OF STRATEGIC

03:48:05.138 --> 03:48:07.273
PROHIBITIONS AND LIMITATIONS.

03:48:07.340 --> 03:48:09.042
AND ALLOWING THOSE TO KIND OF BE

03:48:09.108 --> 03:48:11.177
FORMULATED AN INSTITUTIONALIZED

03:48:11.244 --> 03:48:12.578
SO THAT WE CAN THEN COME BACK

03:48:12.645 --> 03:48:14.514
AND SAY HOW CAN WE EXPAND ON

03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:16.716
THIS I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF US --

03:48:16.783 --> 03:48:18.017
IN THIS HOUSE IN THIS

03:48:18.084 --> 03:48:20.086
LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY SAY THAT

03:48:20.153 --> 03:48:22.288
WE'VE CREATED ST SILVER BULLET

03:48:22.355 --> 03:48:24.223
LEGISLATION THAT HAS FIXED ALL

03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:26.392
ISSUES IN ONE BILL.

03:48:26.459 --> 03:48:28.127
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE SHOULD

03:48:28.194 --> 03:48:29.829
SEE THIS AS THE FOUNDATION FOR

03:48:29.896 --> 03:48:31.197
BEGINNING TO GROW AND EXPAND

03:48:31.264 --> 03:48:33.399
THOSE LARGER CONVERSATION AROUND

03:48:33.466 --> 03:48:35.201
STOPPING OR PROHIBITING.

03:48:35.268 --> 03:48:36.769
THE SALE OF THE CIGARETTES TO

03:48:36.836 --> 03:48:38.271
MINORS.

03:48:38.337 --> 03:48:39.472
YOU KNOW WHO ARE STILL HAVING

03:48:39.539 --> 03:48:40.673
THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPED BY THE AGE

03:48:40.740 --> 03:48:42.375
OF TWENTY FIVE WHEN THESE

03:48:42.442 --> 03:48:44.043
PRODUCTS CAN BE DISASTROUS LEE

03:48:44.110 --> 03:48:47.013
ADDICTIVE RIGHT SO -- I THINK

03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:48.214
WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT

03:48:48.281 --> 03:48:49.348
WERE RECOGNIZING WE'RE GOING

03:48:49.415 --> 03:48:52.685
AFTER THE RETAILERS RATHER THAN

03:48:52.752 --> 03:48:54.754
PUNISHING THE USE.

03:48:54.821 --> 03:48:55.354
AND TO DO QUITE OFTEN IN THIS

03:48:55.421 --> 03:48:56.389
BUILDING.

03:48:56.456 --> 03:48:58.157
MR BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE

03:48:58.224 --> 03:48:59.826
YOUR QUESTION I WOULD AND I WANT

03:48:59.892 --> 03:49:01.961
TO START BY EXPRESSING MY DEEP

03:49:02.028 --> 03:49:03.429
RESPECT AND APPRECIATION TO THAT

THE JOINT AUTHORS FOR TAKING ON

03:49:05.465 --> 03:49:07.100
A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE.

03:49:07.166 --> 03:49:09.735
AND FOR DOING VERY HARD WORK I I

03:49:09.802 --> 03:49:11.104
UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED

03:49:11.170 --> 03:49:12.305
IN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS

03:49:12.371 --> 03:49:13.639
MEETING AFTER MULTIPLE HOURS

03:49:13.706 --> 03:49:14.774
WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH WITH

03:49:14.841 --> 03:49:16.209
MEMBERS WITH OTHER AUTHORS TO

03:49:16.275 --> 03:49:18.144
TRY TO PULL TOGETHER A A

03:49:18.211 --> 03:49:18.611
SOLUTION AND I TOTALLY

03:49:18.678 --> 03:49:20.446
UNDERSTAND -- THE ART OF THE

03:49:20.513 --> 03:49:22.181
DEAL THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF

03:49:22.248 --> 03:49:24.016
COMPROMISED -- A NEED TO NOT

03:49:24.083 --> 03:49:25.151
HAVE THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY

03:49:25.218 --> 03:49:28.387
THE OF THE GOOD AND I I DO WANNA --

03:49:28.454 --> 03:49:29.922
EXPRESS.

03:49:29.989 --> 03:49:31.457
MY SUPPORT FOR A CERTAIN

03:49:31.524 --> 03:49:32.492
COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL AND

03:49:32.558 --> 03:49:33.526
INCLUDING -- THE PENALTIES

03:49:33.593 --> 03:49:34.894
AGAINST RETAILERS WHO DON'T

03:49:34.961 --> 03:49:36.395
COMPLY WITH THE LAW YOUR

03:49:36.462 --> 03:49:37.864
WILLINGNESS TO REMOVE THE

03:49:37.930 --> 03:49:39.365
PENALTIES AGAINST OUT THOSE WERE

03:49:39.432 --> 03:49:40.066
UNDER AGE I THINK THOSE ARE

03:49:40.133 --> 03:49:40.733
EXCELLENT.

03:49:40.800 --> 03:49:43.202
AND AND I APPRECIATE THEM VERY

03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:47.073
MUCH THAT THE PART THAT.

03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:48.808
HANGS ME UP -- RIGHT NOW IN THE

03:49:48.875 --> 03:49:49.976
CURRENT FORM OF THE BILL IS IS

03:49:50.042 --> 03:49:51.511
THE FLAVOR ISSUE -- I'M NOT

03:49:51.577 --> 03:49:52.945
ENTIRELY A PURIST ON IT BUT I

03:49:53.012 --> 03:49:54.046
THINK.

03:49:54.113 --> 03:49:55.181
THE MINT FLAVOR IS VERY

03:49:55.248 --> 03:49:57.416
ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS -- I KNOW

03:49:57.483 --> 03:49:58.017
YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS

03:49:58.084 --> 03:49:59.552
COMPETING STUDIES WE HAVEN'T

03:49:59.619 --> 03:50:01.020
AGREED IN THIS ROOM.

03:50:01.087 --> 03:50:01.787
THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES IN OUR

03:50:01.854 --> 03:50:04.457
DEBATE -- BUT FROM ANECDOTAL

03:50:04.524 --> 03:50:05.825
EVIDENCE FROM OTHER EVIDENCE

03:50:05.892 --> 03:50:08.027
THAT I'VE HEARD -- I THINK IT'S

03:50:08.094 --> 03:50:10.096
VERY ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS -- MAYBE

03:50:10.163 --> 03:50:12.331
MENTHOL LESS SO -- AND IN MY OWN

03:50:12.398 --> 03:50:13.933

IS WE'VE MADE GREAT EFFORT.

03:53:26.559 --> 03:53:27.960
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS TO TAKE

03:53:28.027 --> 03:53:30.629
VERY SERIOUSLY -- THE BODY OF

03:53:30.696 --> 03:53:31.597
WORK THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE

03:53:31.664 --> 03:53:34.200
FDA -- WHERE THIS IS BEEN A HOT

03:53:34.266 --> 03:53:37.136
TOPIC IN MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE --

03:53:37.203 --> 03:53:39.238
THEY HAVE A PROCESS.

03:53:39.305 --> 03:53:40.539
THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT --

03:53:40.606 --> 03:53:42.475
TIMING WISE WITH AND WE LOOKED

03:53:42.541 --> 03:53:43.609
AT IT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THIS

03:53:43.676 --> 03:53:46.145
FORCE US BACK TO THE TABLE TO

03:53:46.212 --> 03:53:48.514
REVIEW -- THE ACTIVITIES AND THE

03:53:48.581 --> 03:53:50.383
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROVISIONS

03:53:50.449 --> 03:53:52.251
WOULD PUT THIS BILL INTO PERHAPS

03:53:52.318 --> 03:53:53.886
STRENGTHEN THEM AT THAT TIME --

03:53:53.953 --> 03:53:55.921
BUT CERTAINLY I CAN SAY FOR

03:53:55.988 --> 03:53:56.756
MYSELF AND WILL SPEAK FOR ALL

03:53:56.822 --> 03:53:57.890
THE ALTERS THAT JUST OFF THE

03:53:57.957 --> 03:54:03.629
CUFF -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:54:03.696 --> 03:54:04.797
I FEEL.

03:54:04.864 --> 03:54:06.866
COULDN'T TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT

03:54:06.932 --> 03:54:08.701
THE FOR SOME REASON YOU THOUGHT

03:54:08.768 --> 03:54:09.435
THE REMOVAL OF THE SUNSET.

03:54:09.502 --> 03:54:11.570
ADDED SOME -- GRAVITY TO THE

03:54:11.637 --> 03:54:13.005
BILL -- THAT CERTAINLY I'D BE

03:54:13.072 --> 03:54:14.306
OPEN MINDED ABOUT IT -- BUT

03:54:14.373 --> 03:54:15.708
HOPEFULLY THAT EXPLAINS AT LEAST

03:54:15.775 --> 03:54:16.776
THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF HOW WE

03:54:16.842 --> 03:54:18.010
ARRIVED AT THAT POSITION.

03:54:18.077 --> 03:54:21.080
YEAH HI I I WILL SAY YOU HAVE

03:54:21.147 --> 03:54:22.348
TWO SECTIONS WITH THE SUNSET.

03:54:22.415 --> 03:54:23.916
THE SECOND ONE I THINK MAKES

03:54:23.983 --> 03:54:26.051
PERFECTLY GOOD SENSE.

03:54:26.118 --> 03:54:29.255
THIS ONE IS MORE OF AN ISSUE --

03:54:29.321 --> 03:54:31.457
I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BILL

03:54:31.524 --> 03:54:32.024
TODAY BUT AS IT MOVES TO THE

03:54:32.091 --> 03:54:32.958
FLOOR.

03:54:33.025 --> 03:54:34.727
THAT'S THE THING THAT I MOSTLY

03:54:34.794 --> 03:54:36.429
FOCUSED ON I SORT OF THINK.

03:54:36.495 --> 03:54:39.265
FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT

03:54:39.331 --> 03:54:42.034
TO JUST LEAVE THE RULES IN PLACE --

03:54:42.101 --> 03:54:43.102
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE DON'T

03:54:43.169 --> 03:54:44.303
SLIDE BACKWARDS SO WHAT THE

03:54:44.370 --> 03:54:46.272
RESTRICTIONS ARE WE STILL ENGAGE

03:54:46.338 --> 03:54:49.141
DEBATE IS EMPTY IS DOING THINGS.

03:54:49.208 --> 03:54:50.176
BUT I THINK IT.

03:54:50.242 --> 03:54:51.510
IT MAKES CLEAR THAT WE WE

03:54:51.577 --> 03:54:53.012
MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA STRONG

03:54:53.078 --> 03:54:54.747
RESTRICTIONS.

03:54:54.814 --> 03:54:56.682
UNTIL A FUTURE LET'S SEE BY

03:54:56.749 --> 03:54:58.818
DECIDE YOU WANT TO CHANGE THEM.

03:54:58.884 --> 03:55:00.453
AND NOT THAT.

03:55:00.519 --> 03:55:01.487
THE CLOCK PAST MIDNIGHT AND NOW

03:55:01.554 --> 03:55:03.422
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CONTROLS IN

03:55:03.489 --> 03:55:03.722
PLACE THAT.

03:55:03.789 --> 03:55:06.258
SEEMS A LITTLE.

03:55:06.325 --> 03:55:08.227
DOESN'T MAKE GOOD SENSE.

03:55:08.294 --> 03:55:09.628
THANK YOU FOR THE COM WILL

03:55:09.695 --> 03:55:11.096

EPIDEMIC RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES IS

03:55:51.237 --> 03:55:52.104
UNBELIEVABLE.

03:55:52.171 --> 03:55:53.739
AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO

03:55:53.806 --> 03:55:56.308

WITHTHE WAY THE ENFORCEMENT

ALCOHOLS DONE IN BASICALLY WE'VE

03:57:35.207 --> 03:57:36.008

03:57:36.075 --> 03:57:37.142
WHATSOEVER.

03:57:37.209 --> 03:57:38.644
SO DIED GOODNESS TO REVISIT THIS

03:57:38.711 --> 03:57:39.244
THIS IS A START IT IS BETTER

03:57:39.311 --> 03:57:39.812
THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

03:57:39.878 --> 03:57:41.614
BECAUSE NOT BEING A FORCES AN

03:57:41.680 --> 03:57:45.818
ISSUE -- THE FDA SAYS THAT.

03:57:45.884 --> 03:57:47.620
THEY BECAUSE BEEN SMOKING.

03:57:47.686 --> 03:57:48.821
OBVIOUSLY YOU IN AMERICAN

03:57:48.887 --> 03:57:51.190
SOCIETY SAYS ON THERE --

03:57:51.256 --> 03:57:53.092
STATEMENT BASED ON CURRENTLY

03:57:53.158 --> 03:57:54.326
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE USING.

03:57:54.393 --> 03:57:55.461
CURRENT GENERATION CIGARETTES IS

03:57:55.527 --> 03:57:56.562
LESS HARMFUL THAN SMOKING

03:57:56.629 --> 03:57:57.563
CIGARETTES.

03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:58.864
THE HEALTH EFFECTS A LONG TERM

03:57:58.931 --> 03:58:00.265

03:58:00.332 --> 03:58:01.767
FIND OUT AT SOME POINT.

03:58:01.834 --> 03:58:03.702
FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.

03:58:03.769 --> 03:58:04.236
LIKE I SAID THEY HAVE THE

03:58:04.303 --> 03:58:05.371
ALCOHOL STINGS AND THAT'S BEEN

03:58:05.437 --> 03:58:06.438
DONE ALREADY TO ADDRESS THE

03:58:06.505 --> 03:58:08.007
ALCOHOL ISSUE IN TEAMS BUT

03:58:08.073 --> 03:58:09.608
NOTHING'S BEING DONE TO ADDRESS

03:58:09.675 --> 03:58:10.843
A BABY ISSUE.

03:58:10.909 --> 03:58:12.444
SO I THINK WITH THIS LEGISLATION

03:58:12.511 --> 03:58:13.679
EXIST WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

03:58:13.746 --> 03:58:20.786
I'VE GOT TIME TO MODIFY IT BUT

03:58:20.853 --> 03:58:23.088
TO SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING.

03:58:23.155 --> 03:58:24.623
IS UNACCEPTABLE.

03:58:24.690 --> 03:58:25.257
WE'RE GONNA BE SOMETHING IS THE

03:58:25.324 --> 03:58:27.459
VEHICLE I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IT.

03:58:27.526 --> 03:58:30.262

DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. FOR THE

03:58:45.310 --> 03:58:47.379
FOR THE MINERS I THINK THAT WAS.

03:58:47.446 --> 03:58:48.447

IS.

03:58:52.584 --> 03:58:54.053
BANNING THE FLAVORS BECAUSE I

03:58:54.119 --> 03:58:57.156
GET SO MANY EMAILS FROM

03:58:57.222 --> 03:58:58.991
CONSTITUENTS SAYING THIS HELPED

03:58:59.058 --> 03:59:01.160
ME TO QUIT SMOKING DON'T TAKE

FROM IT.

03:59:08.067 --> 03:59:09.935
AN ICE I MEAN I CAN UNDERSTAND

03:59:10.002 --> 03:59:11.870
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING WHICH IS

03:59:11.937 --> 03:59:13.539
THAT'S TERRIBLE THAT THE KIDS

03:59:13.605 --> 03:59:15.441
ARE USING THEM AND OTHER PEOPLE

03:59:15.507 --> 03:59:16.108
ARE HELPING THE MUSEUM BUT THAT

03:59:16.175 --> 03:59:17.576
BUT I AM AN ADULT AND I GET TO

03:59:17.643 --> 03:59:18.844

CIGARETTES AND ON ON TO

03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:27.019
SOMETHING THAT -- THE FDA SO FAR

03:59:27.086 --> 03:59:29.021
HAS SAID WE BELIEVE IS CERTAINLY

03:59:29.088 --> 03:59:30.255
LESS HARMFUL THAN REGULAR

03:59:30.322 --> 03:59:33.559
TOBACCO PRODUCTS -- HAVE YOU I

03:59:33.625 --> 03:59:34.760
KNOW YOU CHECK MADE ATTENDED

03:59:34.827 --> 03:59:36.562
CHANGES TO THIS BILL I HATE TO

03:59:39.198 --> 03:59:40.132
AT ALL.

CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

03:59:50.776 --> 03:59:53.979
NOT SELLING IT -- YOU HAVE THE

03:59:54.046 --> 03:59:55.347
INITIAL FIND -- THE ADDITIONAL

03:59:55.414 --> 03:59:57.449
FINANCIAL BURDEN WHICH WHICH I

03:59:57.516 --> 03:59:58.784
THINK IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO

03:59:58.851 --> 04:00:00.452
FRANKLY I MEAN THE HEAD ON THE

04:00:00.519 --> 04:00:02.821
FIRST TIME NOT THE THIRD TIME --

04:00:02.888 --> 04:00:04.289
I THINK THAT'S IN IN AN

04:00:04.356 --> 04:00:06.091
EDUCATION CAMPAIGN I THINK IS

04:00:06.158 --> 04:00:08.060
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE

04:00:08.127 --> 04:00:09.394
CAN PUT ALL THE ENFORCEMENT OF

04:00:09.461 --> 04:00:10.896
PLACE THAT WE WANT BUT IF.

04:00:10.963 --> 04:00:12.064
IF IF THE SCHOOLS AREN'T TALKING

04:00:12.131 --> 04:00:13.132
TO THE KIDS ABOUT THIS AND

04:00:13.198 --> 04:00:14.299
THEY'RE NOT SEEING IT EVERYWHERE

04:00:14.366 --> 04:00:15.634
JUST LIKE THEY SEE OTHER SIGNS

04:00:15.701 --> 04:00:17.402
OF IN BUS STOPS AND THINGS LIKE

04:00:17.469 --> 04:00:18.537
THAT WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT THE

04:00:18.604 --> 04:00:19.872
DANGERS OF SMOKING OR THE

04:00:19.938 --> 04:00:26.979
DANGERS OF DROWNING OR YOU KNOW.

04:00:27.045 --> 04:00:27.913
CAN SEE THIS STUFF IT'S IT ALL

04:00:27.980 --> 04:00:29.081
WORKS IN CONCERT TOGETHER THAT

04:00:29.148 --> 04:00:30.149
IS IMPORTANT.

04:00:30.215 --> 04:00:30.315

04:00:36.889 --> 04:00:38.190
DISSOLVED A LOT OF THE

04:00:38.257 --> 04:00:40.893
OPPOSITION THAT EXISTS RELATING

04:00:40.959 --> 04:00:42.494
TO THE FLAVORS BECAUSE ADULTS

04:00:42.561 --> 04:00:44.296
ARE FEELING LIKE.

04:00:44.363 --> 04:00:45.264
THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT WE'RE

04:00:45.330 --> 04:00:47.299
TAKING AWAY FROM THEM SO IF YOU

PART PUBLIC I THINK THE RESOURCE

04:01:40.285 --> 04:01:42.354
ISSUES I THINK THERE'S SYSTEMIC

04:01:42.421 --> 04:01:43.722
ISSUES THAT WE CAN BE OF

04:01:43.789 --> 04:01:45.257

BUT IT CERTAINLY CALLS THE

04:01:48.861 --> 04:01:49.394
QUESTION THAT WE NEED BETTER

04:01:49.461 --> 04:01:50.963

HANDS OF KIDS THAT WE HAVE SOME

04:02:16.989 --> 04:02:17.823

04:21:52.596 --> 04:21:54.799
FELT WAS DUE TO NICOTINE

04:21:54.865 --> 04:21:55.833

04:21:57.668 --> 04:21:58.469

04:22:23.060 --> 04:22:24.328

WHERE THEY CAN FIND PRODUCTS.
