00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:50.395
TALKED ABOUT BEFORE OF TRYING TO

00:33:50.461 --> 00:33:51.829
GRAB THE CIVIC CENTER UNDER

00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.231
EMPLOYED.

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:54.832
IN THE MORE IMPORTANTLY.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:55.633
GRABBING THE SPOKES THAT ARE

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.435
CHRONICALLY UNEMPLOYED TRYING TO

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:59.170
GET THEM IN A POSITION TO WHERE

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.638
THEY CAN HAVE A MEANINGFUL

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.106
GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:04.675
SO WHAT IS RIGHT NOW THE TO THE

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:07.145
COST REPLACE THE TODAY IS ABOUT

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:07.745
TWENTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A

00:34:07.812 --> 00:34:08.413
PLACEMENT.

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:09.680
AND THAT MIGHT SOUND A LOT LIKE

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:11.449
A LOT BUT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY NOT

00:34:11.516 --> 00:34:14.285
THE THE PRIVATE SECTOR COST PER

00:34:14.352 --> 00:34:16.421
PLACEMENT TODAY IS ABOUT FORTY

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:17.722
ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:19.424
AND THE NEXT BEST COMPETING

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.426
FEDERAL PROGRAM LIKE OURS THE

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:23.961
COST REPLACEMENT IS NEXT ALMOST

00:34:24.028 --> 00:34:26.464
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.332
SO WE STILL ARE BARGAIN.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.168
OKAY AND I'VE ACTUALLY ONE OTHER

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:33.371
THING IN THE I REPEAT FUTURE

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:34.272
NORTH.

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:35.173
WE I OFTEN HAVE PEOPLE COME THAT

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.007
EMPLOYERS COMING INTO THE OFFICE

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:37.041
AND TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:41.045
LIKE TO HIRE MORE VETS.

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.914
SO WE'LL LOOK AT HOW DO THEY GET

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.514
IN TOUCH WITH YOU HOW WE YOU

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.382
KNOW.

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.485
WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR HIGH --

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:50.288
PUTTING ADDITIONAL EMPLOYERS ON

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:52.023
REALLY VERY SIMPLE JUST BE REACH

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:53.658
OUT TO OUR WORK FORCE TEAM ABOUT

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:54.926
TWELVE FOLKS RIGHT NOW.

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.294
A RUN BY AN EXTREMELY CAPABLE --

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.529
MAJOR SHANNON TERRY AND THAT

00:34:58.596 --> 00:35:00.965
THEY BE MORE THAN HAPPY --

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:02.733
TO TO GET THEM LINKED TOGETHER

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.935
WITH OUR TEAM AND GET THEM ON

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.770
THE LIST OF BUSINESS PARTNERS.

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.171
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT.

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.640
ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:35:09.707 --> 00:35:11.409
PETRIE-NORRIS.

GOOD STEP FOR FOR PEOPLE COMING

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:19.584

ALREADY COMING AT THE STATE HAS

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.228

ENSURING THAT WE AT THE VETERANS

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:33.064
PREFERENCE POINTS STILL APPLY

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.866
AND AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

00:35:34.932 --> 00:35:36.234
USUALLY IMPORTANT.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.169
I SEE NO SIGNIFICANT --

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:41.472
STUMBLING BLOCKS A ROAD BLOCKS

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:43.074
TO TO EXECUTING THAT.

00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:52.884
THEY HAVE A RELATIVELY ROBUST

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.919
WELL SO I THINK.

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:56.254

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:04.862
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS.

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.464

OPINIONS --

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.079
BUT WOULD IT BE SAFE TO SAY THAT

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:23.047
INCREASING VETERANS PROP FROM

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:24.448
POINTS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:25.416
WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP A LOT OF

00:36:25.483 --> 00:36:25.683
THESE --

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.385
VETERANS GET THE PLACEMENTS

THE INCREASE VETERANS PREFERENCE

00:37:01.152 --> 00:37:02.520
POINTS AND I THINK I GET IN

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:03.688
TROUBLE FOR THAT --

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:06.223
AND WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK WITH

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.858

TO PRIVATE SECTOR DIVIDE AND IF

00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.303
THERE'S FRANKLY KNOW REASON WHY

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.771
THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE IF YOU

00:37:20.838 --> 00:37:23.074

WHEELER DOWN I FIVE FRANKLY

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:28.646
SOMETIMES I FIVE LOOKS LIKE

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:31.248
POLLUTION BUT BUT YOU GET MY

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:33.551
POINT [inaudible]

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:35.252
OKAY [inaudible]

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:37.388
OKAY THANKS.

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:38.155
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT

00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:39.490
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE BILL

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.292
MISTER CHAIR.

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.593
ALL RIGHT AND HOW ABOUT THE

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.495
STATE OF ARMORIES OKAY YEAH THE

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:47.098
STATE ARMORIES --

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:48.799
SAID THE STATE OWNS NINETY SEVEN

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:52.370
ARMORIES IN CALIFORNIA --

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:53.204
THE CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THAT

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.905
IS THERE ARE ON AVERAGE ABOUT

00:37:54.972 --> 00:37:58.042
SEVENTY YEARS OLD --

00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:59.977
AND WITHOUT THE STATE'S SUPPORT

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:02.179
AND FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS --

00:38:02.246 --> 00:38:05.483
WE COULD NOT --

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.251
SUSTAINABLE ARMORY RENOVATION

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:10.121
PROGRAM FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.189
STATE ARMORIES NONEXISTENT.

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:12.757
FEDERAL FUNDING FOR FEDERAL

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.558
ARMIES THE STATE IS ALSO ALMOST

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:15.860
NONEXISTENT --

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:16.360
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:18.396
CHALLENGING THINGS THAT WE HAVE

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.196
TO DEAL WITH THE MILITARY

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:20.765
DEPARTMENT IS THE ABSOLUTE LACK

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:22.266
OF FEDERAL MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:25.236
FUNDING COMING IN THE STATE --

00:38:25.302 --> 00:38:28.606
SO WE RELY HEAVILY ON THE STATE

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:29.507
TO MAINTAIN OUR REASONING

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:31.175
CONDITION THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:32.410
THE SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN THAT

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.145
WORK AND LIVE IN THEM --

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:35.379
BUT I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:36.914
ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE ARMORY

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.249
RENOVATION FOR OR SUSTAINABLE

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:39.717
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM IN

00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:41.752
GENERAL --

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.254
REALLY HAS FOUR PRIMARY PILLARS.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.589
FIRST IS DIVESTITURE WE'VE BEEN

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:47.858
VERY SUCCESSFUL OVER LAST YEAR'S

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.327
I'VE DONE IT DIVESTING OBSOLETE

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:52.697
ARMORIES ARE RESET SIMPLY ARE

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:54.265
BEYOND ECONOMICAL REPAIR.

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:55.266
AND IN THAT CREATES AND

00:38:55.332 --> 00:38:56.767
GENERATES CASH FOR US THAT WE

00:38:56.834 --> 00:38:58.469
PUT INTO THE ARMORY FUN WHICH WE

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:59.003
IN TURN.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.871
CAN BUILD YOUR WRISTS WITH SO

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:03.574
IT'S IT'S A GOOD IT REDUCES

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.276
DRAMATICALLY OUR BACKLOG REPAIR

00:39:05.342 --> 00:39:06.177
AND MAINTENANCE.

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:07.845
SO WE'RE TAKING THOSE THOSE

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:09.480
PROPERTIES THAT WOULD BE SUPER

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:13.084
EXPENSIVE TO RENOVATE WERE TAKEN

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.020
WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCES COSTS --

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.621
THE STATE'S ALSO DONE A VERY

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.056
VERY GOOD JOB PAYING DOWN --

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:19.957
OUR BACKLOG REPAIR AND

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:21.692
MAINTENANCE AND I THINK TO THE

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:25.062
TUNE OF TWENTY SIX MILLION OR SO

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:27.198
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.399
THIS IS A HUGELY IMPORTANT FOR

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:30.167
THE DEPARTMENT AS WE CONTINUE TO

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:32.169
RENOVATE APPROXIMATELY THREE

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:33.637
ARMORIES PER YEAR.

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.439
AND THAT'S NEW ROOFS ADA

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.541
COMPLIANCE APPROPRIATE BATHROOMS

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:38.809
ALL THOSE THINGS WE HAVE TO DO

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:40.277
TO ENSURE THAT THE SOLDIERS

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:41.712
AIRMEN THAT THAT WORK FOR US

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:43.380
HAVE THE HAVE THE RIGHT AN

00:39:43.447 --> 00:39:44.415
APPROPRIATE PLACE TO WORK AND

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:45.116
LIVE.

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.951
IN THE LAST THING REALLY THOSE

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:48.586
FOUR PILLARS IS --

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.588
OUR OUR PURCHASE OF OF NEW

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.323
FACILITIES AND AND WE HAVE TO

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:53.290
ONGOING RIGHT NOW WE EXPECT

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:54.859
BREAK GROUND ON A NEW READINESS

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.527
FACILITY THAT ARE THE JOINT

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:57.728
FORCES TRAINING BASE LOS

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:58.028
ELEMENTOS.

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.396
IN THE SPRING.

00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:00.898
AND WE'RE CURRENTLY BUILDING A

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.933
NEW STATE FUNDED HEADQUARTERS

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.768
FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.503
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT --

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.505
NEXT TO MAKE THEIR AIRFIELD SO

SUCCESSFUL --

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.690
BEEN VERY FRUGAL WITH HOW WE DO

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:27.958
IT -- BE WE

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.260
HAVE A CHALLENGE IN THE

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:30.494
DEPARTMENT WHERE WE HAVE TO

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:31.829
FUNDAMENTALLY LOOKING TO THE

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.864

FACILITIES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:45.176
DON'T OBSOLETE.

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.210
WHEN THEY'RE BUILT A BUILDING IN

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:47.444
THE TURN AROUND TEN YEARS LATER

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:49.246

IN MY OPENING COMMENTS ON THIS

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.166
WHEN I TALKED ABOUT FEDERAL

MILITARY CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:19.203
THAT'S THAT'S MONEY SOLELY

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.304
FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:31.282
THE STATE WHEN THE STATE PUTS IN

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:33.017
ONE BUCK AND GETS TWO BOOKS BACK

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:33.951
I CAN'T BE THAT I TAKE THAT

WE DO EVERY DAY --

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.926
IT.

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:45.029
I LIKE I SAID I SET ASIDE LONG

00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:46.397
TERM QUESTIONS ABOUT OF PROPERTY

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:47.097
MANAGEMENT --

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:48.299
ARMY TO BECOME AN ISSUE --

00:42:48.365 --> 00:42:49.433
IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS AND SAN

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.267
DIEGO COUNTY WITH REGARD TO THE

THAT ARE BEING --

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.737
NEGLECTED BY THE FEDERAL

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:54.872
GOVERNMENT --

00:42:54.939 --> 00:42:55.472
THAT IT WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:58.375
TODAY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

00:42:58.442 --> 00:43:00.978
THOSE WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO TAKE

TO NON DEPARTMENT USES YEAH SO.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.086
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT.

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:10.654
LAST CALENDAR YEAR WE DID

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.823

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.124
THOUSAND SHELTER NIGHTS AGO

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.627
ACROSS THE ARMORIES THAT WE

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.362
HOUSE THE HOMELESS AND I'M NOT

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:21.865
ARMY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.801
IT DEPENDS IF THE ARMORIES BEING

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:24.935
USED -- WE

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.770

00:43:26.837 --> 00:43:28.539
OPEN EVERY ARMORY FOR HOMELESS

00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:29.640
SHELTERS BECAUSE THEN IT BECOMES

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.742
A IMPACT ON OUR READINESS OUR

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:34.278
ABILITY TO PERFORM OUR MISSIONS

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:35.746

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:57.067
FORCE BY ANY OF OUR PERSONNEL

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.235
KNOWN AS WORK NONE --

00:53:59.302 --> 00:53:59.836
AND WHAT'S THE COST OF THIS AT

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:02.272
THIS POINT --

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:04.441
I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER OF THE

00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:05.108
TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I'LL GET IT

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:05.842
TO YOU.

00:54:05.909 --> 00:54:07.744
MILLIONS OF ABSOLUTELY AS A

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.879
REIMBURSABLE.

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:12.048
IT'S SERVE IT IS WELL THERE AND

00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:13.817
SO IT'S IMPORTANT STAND THESE

00:54:13.883 --> 00:54:15.518
THIS THE SOLDIERS AIRMEN THAT

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:16.119
ARE ON THE BORDER THERE UNDER

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:17.387
WHAT THEY CALL TITLE THIRTY TWO

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:17.787
AUTHORITIES SO.

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:18.321
THAT MONEY FLOWS FROM THE

00:54:18.388 --> 00:54:19.389
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTO THE

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:21.224
MILITARY DEPARTMENT DOESN'T

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:22.459
TOUCH THE STATE AT ALL OKAY.

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:23.860
SO IN FACT IT'S NOT REIMBURSABLE

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.829
PER SE THE CHALLENGE I THINK

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:26.930
WHERE WE TALK ABOUT REIMBURSABLE

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.832
SIN AND THIS IS.

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.467
I THINK IT FOR A LOT OF FOLKS

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:31.568
DON'T KNOW IS THIS THAT THE

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:33.036
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IS NOT

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.204
BEING REIMBURSED BY THE

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.139
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:38.108
FOR ANY OF THIS --

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:40.877
WHICH I FIND.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:46.049
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:51.087

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:53.056

IT'S BEING PAID DIRECTLY BY THE

00:54:57.494 --> 00:54:59.029
FEDERAL AYE THAT'S CORRECT

00:54:59.095 --> 00:54:59.963
THERE'S NO DIRECT COST OF THE

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.730

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.031
RULES.

00:56:08.098 --> 00:56:09.432
AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.701

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.536

WAS AND THE REASON I SAID WE

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:11.194
WERE GOING TO SKIP IT IS BECAUSE

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.495
WE HAD THE QUESTION THERE BUT

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:14.063

THOUGH IT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.363
CONCERNED I RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.331
COMING FROM A POSITIVE PLACE A

00:57:48.398 --> 00:57:49.432

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:50.700
DIFFERENTIATE.

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:51.668
BUT MáS ALWAYS CURIOUS TO KNOW

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:52.969
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED BY

00:57:53.036 --> 00:57:53.303

WE DON'T.

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:07.283
