TO CALL OUR MEETING TO ORDER.

00:27:50.536 --> 00:27:53.405 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE SECOND MEETING OF

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.174 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:58.810 region:rollup2
ON RESOURCES AND TRANSPORTATION.

00:27:55.174 --> 00:28:01.580 region:rollup2
FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TODAY I.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.881 region:rollup2
WE WILL BEGIN WHAT I. EXPECT MAY

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.417 region:rollup2
WELL BE A MULTI YEAR

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:06.518 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF ALL

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:08.153 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:10.055 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES.

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:11.857 region:rollup2
IN ARE OVERSIGHT ROLE IT IS OUR

00:28:10.055 --> 00:28:13.926 region:rollup2
DUTY TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:16.128 region:rollup2
OUR PROGRAMS ARE NOT ONLY

00:28:13.926 --> 00:28:17.763 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING AS INTENDED. BUT

00:28:16.128 --> 00:28:19.431 region:rollup2
MAXIMIZING THEIR POTENTIAL

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:21.600 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT

00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:22.100 region:rollup2
WITH RECYCLING WERE REALLY NOT

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.236 region:rollup2
THERE ON EITHER OF THOSE

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:25.637 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:27.506 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AS POLICY MAKERS AND

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:28.974 region:rollup2
ELECTED STEWARDS OF THE STATE WE

00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:31.043 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO TAXED

00:28:28.974 --> 00:28:33.345 region:rollup2
WITH INNOVATING AND INSTALLING

00:28:31.043 --> 00:28:35.180 region:rollup2
NEW APPROACHES TO OUR EVER

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:37.015 region:rollup2
EVOLVING CHALLENGES. WHICH IS

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.550 region:rollup2
WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY. IT'S

00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:39.885 region:rollup2
NO SECRET THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.720 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PROGRAMS NEED

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:43.722 region:rollup2
REFINEMENT AS I MENTIONED IN

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:45.824 region:rollup2
FACT FIXES TO THE BEVERAGE

00:28:43.722 --> 00:28:47.159 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM MOST

00:28:45.824 --> 00:28:48.994 region:rollup2
COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE.

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:50.562 region:rollup2
BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM HAVE BEEN

00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:53.332 region:rollup2
PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:55.367 region:rollup2
AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN EACH OF

00:28:53.332 --> 00:28:57.336 region:rollup2
THE LAST FIVE YEARS SINCE I'VE

00:28:55.367 --> 00:28:58.670 region:rollup2
BEEN CHAIR. IT'S SAFE TO SAY

00:28:57.336 --> 00:29:00.472 region:rollup2
THAT ALONG WITH CAP AND TRADE IN

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:03.442 region:rollup2
OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

00:29:00.472 --> 00:29:04.042 region:rollup2
FUND THE BOTTLE BILL HAS BEEN

00:29:03.442 --> 00:29:06.144 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED MORE THAN ANY OTHER

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:07.312 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:09.314 region:rollup2
AS PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:10.949 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY WE WILL CONTINUE

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:12.818 region:rollup2
TO WORK ON FIXES HOWEVER AS

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:14.686 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS WE HAVE A DUTY TO

00:29:12.818 --> 00:29:17.022 region:rollup2
TAKE A STEP BACK AND EXAMINE OUR

00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:18.724 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO RECYCLING. AND TAKE

00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:20.459 region:rollup2
A FURTHER STEP BACK AND EXAMINE

00:29:18.724 --> 00:29:23.362 region:rollup2
OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS

00:29:20.459 --> 00:29:25.464 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS.

00:29:23.362 --> 00:29:26.965 region:rollup2
LET'S SINGLE OUT JUST ONE OF THE

00:29:25.464 --> 00:29:27.466 region:rollup2
MANY PRODUCTS WE PRODUCE AND

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:29.635 region:rollup2
CONSUME.

00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:31.103 region:rollup2
PLASTICS.

00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:32.771 region:rollup2
SINCE THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:33.905 region:rollup2
GLOBAL PLASTIC PRODUCTION HAS

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:36.541 region:rollup2
RISEN FROM TWO MILLION TONS A

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:37.843 region:rollup2
YEAR TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:39.111 region:rollup2
MILLION TONS.

00:29:37.843 --> 00:29:40.746 region:rollup2
IT'S MUCH BETTER. SHOULD APPLAUD

00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:42.047 region:rollup2
THE LIGHT.

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:44.883 region:rollup2
ADAM THIS IS PRODUCED MORE THAN

00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:46.652 region:rollup2
SIX POINT THREE BILLION TONS OF

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:48.620 region:rollup2
PLASTIC WASTE.

00:29:46.652 --> 00:29:50.022 region:rollup2
OF WHICH NINE PERCENT.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.957 region:rollup2
ONLY NINE PERCENT HAS BEEN

00:29:50.022 --> 00:29:53.725 region:rollup2
RECYCLED TWELVE PERCENT IS

00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:55.827 region:rollup2
INCINERATED WORLDWIDE AND THE

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:57.663 region:rollup2
REMAINING SEVENTY NINE PERCENT.

00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:58.096 region:rollup2
IS DUMPED INTO LANDFILLS.

00:29:57.663 --> 00:30:00.332 region:rollup2
OR LITTERED INTO THE

00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:02.100 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT.

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:03.902 region:rollup2
THIS IS STAGGERING ESPECIALLY

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.471 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE MILLIONS

00:30:03.902 --> 00:30:08.106 region:rollup2
OF BLUE BINS THAT LINE THE

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:10.442 region:rollup2
STREETS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:11.410 region:rollup2
EVERYWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND

00:30:10.442 --> 00:30:14.212 region:rollup2
IN MANY PLACES AROUND THE WORLD

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.448 region:rollup2
ON. TRASH COLLECTING DAYS.

00:30:14.212 --> 00:30:18.817 region:rollup2
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE

00:30:16.448 --> 00:30:20.419 region:rollup2
ARE THE STATISTICS?

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:22.020 region:rollup2
WHAT ALSO STAGGERING IT IS THAT

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:24.823 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF SOLID COULD FILL

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.024 region:rollup2
AN AREA THE SIZE OF MANHATTAN

00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:28.126 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE FEET

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:29.361 region:rollup2
DEEP?

00:30:28.126 --> 00:30:30.896 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TO OUR TWENTY NINE FEET

00:30:29.361 --> 00:30:33.165 region:rollup2
AND SEVEN INCHES THIS IS

00:30:30.896 --> 00:30:34.900 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR ROLAND

00:30:33.165 --> 00:30:36.802 region:rollup2
DIRE AT THE INSTITUTE OF ENERGY

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:39.304 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:30:36.802 --> 00:30:41.506 region:rollup2
SANTA BARBARA.

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:43.075 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THIS

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.376 region:rollup2
PLASTIC WASTE IS ALSO IN OUR

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:46.578 region:rollup2
OCEANS WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC ON

00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:48.380 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE LEVELS.

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:51.283 region:rollup2
FIRST PLASTICS ARE NOT HEALTHY

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.918 region:rollup2
FOR OCEANS AND SEE LIFE AND IN

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:54.519 region:rollup2
TURN NOT HEALTHY FOR US.

00:30:52.918 --> 00:30:56.655 region:rollup2
WELL SALT WATER AND ULTRAVIOLET

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:58.123 region:rollup2
LIGHT BREAKDOWN PLASTICS.

00:30:56.655 --> 00:30:59.825 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT DECOMPOSE AS A

00:30:58.123 --> 00:31:01.293 region:rollup2
RESULT.

00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:02.761 region:rollup2
THESE PLASTICS WHETHER THEY'RE

00:31:01.293 --> 00:31:04.663 region:rollup2
CLAMSHELL PACKAGING.

00:31:02.761 --> 00:31:06.264 region:rollup2
COKE BOTTLE STRAWS

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:08.533 region:rollup2
AND THE LIKE THE BREAKDOWN INTO

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:11.069 region:rollup2
TINY MICRO PLASTICS IN SOME

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:12.904 region:rollup2
CASES LIKE MICROBEADS FOUND IN

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:14.272 region:rollup2
FACIAL SCRUBS AND TOOTHPASTE.

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:16.141 region:rollup2
WE'LL BE SEEING LESS OF THOSE IN

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:18.777 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE OR PLASTIC MICRO

00:31:16.141 --> 00:31:19.277 region:rollup2
FIBERS FROM SYNTHETIC CLOSE WE

00:31:18.777 --> 00:31:19.711 region:rollup2
RUN THROUGH OUR WASHING

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:21.446 region:rollup2
MACHINES.

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:22.881 region:rollup2
THEY PENNED.

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:24.850 region:rollup2
DESERT THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:27.085 region:rollup2
DELIBERATE LEE PRODUCED AS

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.686 region:rollup2
MICHAEL PLASTICS IN A BREAKDOWN

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:27.953 region:rollup2
THAT'S THOUGH THE WAY THEY'RE

00:31:27.686 --> 00:31:30.922 region:rollup2
PRODUCED.

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:32.691 region:rollup2
IN ANY CASE.

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:33.925 region:rollup2
THESE CELL MICROPROCESSOR THAN

00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:35.761 region:rollup2
INGESTED BY FASHION AS THE

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:36.995 region:rollup2
ECONOMISTS RECENTLY POINTED OUT

00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:38.263 region:rollup2
AN ARTICLE PUBLISHED JUST LAST

00:31:36.995 --> 00:31:39.765 region:rollup2
WEEK.

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:43.735 region:rollup2
FROM THERE IT SEEMS ONLY A SHORT

00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:46.204 region:rollup2
JOURNEY TO OUR DINNER PLATES.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:47.606 region:rollup2
WE ALSO DON'T TYPICALLY SEE

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:49.241 region:rollup2
PLASTICS THAT ARE IN THE OCEAN

00:31:47.606 --> 00:31:51.409 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS ESTIMATE THAT OUR

00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:53.111 region:rollup2
OCEANS CONTAIN FIFTY ONE

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:54.813 region:rollup2
TRILLION MICHAEL PLASTIC

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:56.915 region:rollup2
PARTICLES AND THAT BY TWENTY

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:57.349 region:rollup2
FIFTY. THERE WILL BE MORE

00:31:56.915 --> 00:31:59.217 region:rollup2
PLASTIC ARE OCEAN.

00:31:57.349 --> 00:32:01.753 region:rollup2
FINISH

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:03.789 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.756 region:rollup2
FINALLY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:06.358 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA'S RECYCLING RATE

00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:08.593 region:rollup2
FOR

00:32:06.358 --> 00:32:11.663 region:rollup2
ALL BEVERAGE CONTAINERS PLASTIC

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:13.632 region:rollup2
GLASS AND ALUMINUM. IS DECLINING

00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:17.035 region:rollup2
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS

00:32:13.632 --> 00:32:19.104 region:rollup2
MORE RECYCLING CENTERS CLOSE.

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:20.305 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THAT.

00:32:19.104 --> 00:32:21.973 region:rollup2
AND I REALLY THINK THIS IS

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.541 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE GENERAL

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:25.911 region:rollup2
PUBLIC DOESN'T KNOW. AND AS

00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:28.146 region:rollup2
WORD.

00:32:25.911 --> 00:32:29.114 region:rollup2
BECOMES AS THIS IT DOES BECOME

00:32:28.146 --> 00:32:30.749 region:rollup2
MORE GENERALLY KNOWN TO THE

00:32:29.114 --> 00:32:32.851 region:rollup2
PUBLIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:32:30.749 --> 00:32:34.886 region:rollup2
SHOCKED THAT WE'RE NOT ACHIEVING

00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:36.054 region:rollup2
THE GOALS THAT THEY ALL EXPECT

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:37.789 region:rollup2
US TO ACHIEVE.

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:40.525 region:rollup2
AND COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM EVEN

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:42.594 region:rollup2
ONE BOTTLES ARE RETURNED TO BE

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:45.230 region:rollup2
RECYCLED. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS

00:32:42.594 --> 00:32:45.931 region:rollup2
BEING RECYCLED AS WE EXPECT

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.933 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY

00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:50.235 region:rollup2
UNAWARE THAT MUCH OF WHAT THEY

00:32:47.933 --> 00:32:52.704 region:rollup2
THROW INTO THEIR BLUE BINS. ENDS

00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:53.705 region:rollup2
UP IN THE LANDFILL INCLUDING AS

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:55.173 region:rollup2
WAS RECENTLY REPORTED TO MY

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:56.875 region:rollup2
OFFICE

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:58.343 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY CLEAN RECYCLABLE

00:32:56.875 --> 00:33:00.178 region:rollup2
PLASTIC

00:32:58.343 --> 00:33:02.013 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S NO MARKET

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:04.449 region:rollup2
FOR THE PRODUCT.

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:05.917 region:rollup2
SO CONSUMERS ARE NOT ONLY NOT

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:08.587 region:rollup2
GETTING THERE NICKEL OR DIME

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:10.522 region:rollup2
BACK BUT MORE TO THE POINT.

00:33:08.587 --> 00:33:12.123 region:rollup2
THEIR RETURN BOTTLES ARE NOT

00:33:10.522 --> 00:33:13.859 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PAYING RECYCLED.

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:17.028 region:rollup2
DESPITE THE BEST INTENTIONS OF

00:33:13.859 --> 00:33:18.763 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS RECYCLERS REGULATORS

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:20.131 region:rollup2
AND ADVOCATES AND OTHERS WHO

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:22.300 region:rollup2
HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN THIS

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:23.468 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.704 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO DO THEIR PART AND

00:33:23.468 --> 00:33:28.440 region:rollup2
RECYCLE TO NOT LABEL THIS

00:33:25.704 --> 00:33:31.543 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AS FAILING. IN ITS

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.844 region:rollup2
PRIMARY FUNCTION AND MISSION.

00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:34.079 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SOLVE ALL OF

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:35.614 region:rollup2
ARE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:37.916 region:rollup2
TODAY NOR WILL WE COMPLETELY

00:33:35.614 --> 00:33:40.385 region:rollup2
CHANGE OUR PRODUCER AND CONSUMER

00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:42.454 region:rollup2
HABITS HOWEVER. I DO EXPECT THAT

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:44.823 region:rollup2
BY TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT OUR

00:33:42.454 --> 00:33:47.225 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PROGRAMS WE WILL START

00:33:44.823 --> 00:33:49.461 region:rollup2
TO RETHINK THE BUILDING BLOCKS

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:51.496 region:rollup2
OF THE LARGER SOLUTION.

00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:53.932 region:rollup2
AND THAT REALLY LOOK AT MORE

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:56.468 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE AND MORE EFFECTIVE

00:33:53.932 --> 00:33:58.003 region:rollup2
WAYS OF ACCOMPLISHING A GOAL

00:33:56.468 --> 00:34:00.071 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALL SHARE.

00:33:58.003 --> 00:34:01.239 region:rollup2
I MET A VERY PLEASED TODAY TO

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:04.142 region:rollup2
SEE THAT OUR BUDGET CHAIR

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:05.777 region:rollup2
FELTING IS PRESENT AND TO HE HAS

00:34:04.142 --> 00:34:07.412 region:rollup2
BEEN INTENSELY INTERESTED IN

00:34:05.777 --> 00:34:09.080 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE.

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:09.714 region:rollup2
CHAIR TING DID DO WANT TO ADD

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.717 region:rollup2
SOME COMMENTS.

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:14.519 region:rollup2
JUST VERY BRIEFLY IT SEEMS THAT

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.954 region:rollup2
DOWN IS JUST ECHO YOUR. YOUR

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:18.256 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR THAT.

00:34:15.954 --> 00:34:20.592 region:rollup2
HOME FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:22.394 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR.

00:34:20.592 --> 00:34:24.229 region:rollup2
GREAT RECYCLING PROGRAMS AND

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:26.564 region:rollup2
THAT WERE VERY VERY PROUD OF IT

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:28.300 region:rollup2
THINK WE. I'VE EVER PAPER PROUD

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.867 region:rollup2
OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.035 region:rollup2
THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE

00:34:28.867 --> 00:34:32.671 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:34:30.035 --> 00:34:34.739 region:rollup2
SEEMS TO BE THAT WE STRUGGLED TO

00:34:32.671 --> 00:34:35.640 region:rollup2
GET IT ABOVE THE EIGHTY PERCENT

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.342 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD AND IT SEEMS TO COSTS

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:39.144 region:rollup2
A. B. FLUCTUATING A LITTLE BIT

00:34:37.342 --> 00:34:42.047 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PERCENT OF THE PLOW.

00:34:39.144 --> 00:34:43.415 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO.

00:34:42.047 --> 00:34:45.083 region:rollup2
TAKE A STEP BACK IT AND

00:34:43.415 --> 00:34:46.618 region:rollup2
REITERATE THAT OUR GOAL IS NEVER

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.819 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT BUT ABOUT

00:34:46.618 --> 00:34:49.154 region:rollup2
ZERO WASTE. THAT IT'S ABOUT A

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:51.122 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT.

00:34:49.154 --> 00:34:53.458 region:rollup2
AND IT WE SHOULD BE TALKING

00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:54.693 region:rollup2
ABOUT NOT HOW DO WE.

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:56.161 region:rollup2
AND MAINTAIN THE SOLVENCY OF A

00:34:54.693 --> 00:34:57.796 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT KEEPS AT EIGHTY

00:34:56.161 --> 00:34:59.297 region:rollup2
PERCENT BUT WHAT KIND OF PROGRAM

00:34:57.796 --> 00:35:01.299 region:rollup2
DO WE NEED TO HAVE TO GET US TWO

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:02.233 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT SO. THAT WITHOUT

00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:03.568 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO THAT

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:05.203 region:rollup2
HEARING IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:07.205 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. YOU'RE

YOU SOWE WILL BEGIN. TODAY WITH

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:13.111 region:rollup2
A A REPORT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:14.546 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ACTUALLY

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:16.781 region:rollup2
AIMS.

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:17.983 region:rollup2
HERE TO PELUSO LITTLE BIT OF

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.651 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW OF THE

00:35:17.983 --> 00:35:21.052 region:rollup2
BOTTLE PRO.

00:35:19.651 --> 00:35:22.354 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:23.722 region:rollup2
MORNING MEMBERS EVERYONE

MACHINES WITH LEGISLATIVE

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:27.225 region:rollup2
ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:28.093 region:rollup2
DID PREPARE A HANDOUT THAT I

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.761 region:rollup2
THINK THAT YOU MIGHT ALREADY

00:35:28.093 --> 00:35:31.096 region:rollup2

.

00:35:32.697 --> 00:35:35.433 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE

00:35:33.365 --> 00:35:36.601 region:rollup2
A KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

00:35:35.433 --> 00:35:37.836 region:rollup2
IT'LL MOVE THROUGH FAIRLY

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:39.104 region:rollup2
QUICKLY SINCE I KNOW THEIR LOT

00:35:37.836 --> 00:35:40.672 region:rollup2
OF PANELISTS THAT YOU WANT TO

00:35:39.104 --> 00:35:42.507 region:rollup2
GET TO BUT PLEAS FEEL FREE TO.

00:35:40.672 --> 00:35:43.808 region:rollup2
STOP ME ALONG THE WAY. FROM

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:45.076 region:rollup2
THINGS UNCLEAR YOU HAVE ANY

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.578 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:47.846 region:rollup2
SO PERSONAL JUST TALK A LITTLE

00:35:46.578 --> 00:35:49.014 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT WHAT CONTAINERS ARE

00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:50.315 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN THE PROGRAM AND HOW

00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:51.649 region:rollup2
WE DETERMINE WHICH CONTAINERS

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:52.784 region:rollup2
ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE PART OF THE

00:35:51.649 --> 00:35:53.818 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:55.653 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:57.188 region:rollup2
DON'T TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:59.157 region:rollup2
THE FLOW OF THE CONTAINERS

00:35:57.188 --> 00:36:00.525 region:rollup2
THROUGH PROGRAM AND THE EXCHANGE

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:02.994 region:rollup2
OF THE.

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:03.528 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION VALUE ABOUT MONETARY

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:04.295 region:rollup2
VALUE THAT'S TIED TO THOSE

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.997 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS.

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:07.365 region:rollup2
THIRD ALSO GOT SO THE OUTCOMES

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:08.700 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE RECYCLING RATES

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.901 region:rollup2
OVER TIME AND I KNOW YOU TOUCHED

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.437 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT ON THE RECENT

00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:13.638 region:rollup2
TRENDS THERE. ALREADY AND FORTH

00:36:12.437 --> 00:36:15.507 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAM

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:17.942 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES THAT THEY SUPPORT

00:36:15.507 --> 00:36:18.843 region:rollup2
BESIDES JUST THE BASIC CRV

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.346 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR THE CONTAINERS.

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:23.448 region:rollup2
A FIFTH THE STATUS OF THE FIND.

00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:24.783 region:rollup2
ON THE MAIN FUND FOR THE PROGRAM

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:27.252 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY SOME OF THE THE

00:36:24.783 --> 00:36:27.819 region:rollup2
RECENT RECYCLING CLOSURES.

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:29.020 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU LOOK ON THE FIRST

00:36:27.819 --> 00:36:31.222 region:rollup2
PAGE.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:33.058 region:rollup2
.

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:34.893 region:rollup2
THIS FIGURE JUST SHOWS HOW WE

00:36:33.058 --> 00:36:36.428 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHICH CONTAINERS ARE

00:36:34.893 --> 00:36:38.630 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PART THE PROGRAM.

00:36:36.428 --> 00:36:40.298 region:rollup2
IN THE SEA HAS TO DO WITH SIZE

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.766 region:rollup2
OF THE MATERIAL TYPE AND WHAT

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.435 region:rollup2
THE CONTENT OF THE CONTAINER IS

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:45.170 region:rollup2
MADE UP OF. IRELAND AND THERE

00:36:43.435 --> 00:36:46.237 region:rollup2
ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS AS YOU CAN

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.872 region:rollup2
SEE THERE.

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:49.707 region:rollup2
WELL MOST OF THINGS THE PROGRAM

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:51.943 region:rollup2
WATER BOTTLES SODA CAN YOUR

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:53.144 region:rollup2
BOTTLES ON THE TYPICAL THINGS

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:54.612 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE USED TO PAY YOUR

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:55.380 region:rollup2
SCARY FOR.

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.948 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION YOU TURN THE NEXT

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.349 region:rollup2
PAGE.

00:36:56.948 --> 00:37:00.452 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE FLOW OF THE

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:01.686 region:rollup2
CONTAINER PAYMENT SO.

00:37:00.452 --> 00:37:03.421 region:rollup2
AROUND THE OUTSIDER CODE THE

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:04.856 region:rollup2
MAIN OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:06.424 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:07.926 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE AT EACH STAGE OF THE

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:09.260 region:rollup2
CONTAINER CHANGES HANDS.

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:11.262 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S USUALLY SOME KIND

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.297 region:rollup2
OF OF A PAYMENT THAT CHANGES

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.932 region:rollup2
THAT WELL AS WELL.

00:37:12.297 --> 00:37:14.866 region:rollup2
I'M CONSUMERS PAY THEIR DEPOSIT

00:37:13.932 --> 00:37:16.134 region:rollup2
WHEN THE A AT THE POINT OF

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:17.936 region:rollup2
PURCHASE

00:37:16.134 --> 00:37:19.204 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE WAY THAT. THE PROGRAM

00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:20.538 region:rollup2
WORKS IS WE INCENTIVIZE THEM TO

00:37:19.204 --> 00:37:22.907 region:rollup2
BRING ABOUT JUSTIFIED RECYCLER

00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:25.410 region:rollup2
BY. REFUNDING THAT TO THEM.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:27.512 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY DO THAT.

00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:27.712 region:rollup2
IF YOU TURN TO THE THIRD PAGE

00:37:27.512 --> 00:37:29.347 region:rollup2
THEN.

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:30.715 region:rollup2
.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:32.517 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THAT OVER TIME THE

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:34.719 region:rollup2
PROGRAM HAS BEEN RELATIVELY

00:37:32.517 --> 00:37:36.054 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL AT. A BEVERAGE

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:37.422 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING ESPECIALLY

00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:39.290 region:rollup2
FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:41.025 region:rollup2
NOTABLY IN THE YEAR TWO

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.328 region:rollup2
THOUSAND YOU SEE BIG DROP.

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:45.330 region:rollup2
BUT THE P. ET THAT WAS WHEN I

00:37:43.328 --> 00:37:46.498 region:rollup2
WATER BOTTLES BEGAN. OF THEIR

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.465 region:rollup2
INCLUSION IN SO YOU CAN SEE THE

00:37:46.498 --> 00:37:52.303 region:rollup2
RATE WAS MUCH LOWER AND THEN

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:54.072 region:rollup2
CLIMBS AGAIN OVER TIME.

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:54.439 region:rollup2
BUT AS THE CHAIR NOTED IN THE

00:37:54.072 --> 00:37:55.106 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS.

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:55.907 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN THE

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:57.776 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATES.

00:37:55.907 --> 00:37:59.244 region:rollup2
FROM THAT CAN BE A TO REACH

00:37:57.776 --> 00:38:00.678 region:rollup2
MANY FACTORS BUT I KNOW ONE OF

00:37:59.244 --> 00:38:02.180 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT IT CERTAINLY CAN

00:38:00.678 --> 00:38:04.516 region:rollup2
BE RELATED TO SOME OF THE RECENT

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.083 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTER CLOSURES. OF

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:07.385 region:rollup2
SOFT TOUCH ON THAT HERE IN A

00:38:05.083 --> 00:38:08.953 region:rollup2
MOMENT.

00:38:07.385 --> 00:38:11.089 region:rollup2
TURNING TO THE FOURTH PAGE.

00:38:08.953 --> 00:38:12.791 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM ALSO STRIDES

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:14.592 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS A VARIETY OF OTHER

00:38:12.791 --> 00:38:15.593 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES BESIDES JUST THE

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:18.897 region:rollup2
EXCHANGE OF CONTAINERS AND

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:25.970 region:rollup2
SERIES. AS YOU CAN SEE AND THE

00:38:18.897 --> 00:38:29.274 region:rollup2
WAY THE THOUGHT IS FUNDED IS

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:31.142 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THROUGH A CRV THAT'S

00:38:29.274 --> 00:38:31.809 region:rollup2
NOT CLAIMS SO RECYCLING RATE IS

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:33.711 region:rollup2
ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT THAT MEANS

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:34.312 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ONLY PAYING OUT EIGHTY

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:34.946 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF WHAT WAS PAID IN.

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:35.446 region:rollup2
THE OTHER TWENTY PERCENT GOES

00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:36.281 region:rollup2
TOWARDS THESE VARIOUS.

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:37.415 region:rollup2
.

00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:38.016 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS I WON'T GOING TO

00:38:37.415 --> 00:38:39.484 region:rollup2
EACH INDIVIDUAL ONE BUT IF YOU

00:38:38.016 --> 00:38:40.118 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY.

00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:40.618 region:rollup2
WHAT THE OF THOSE HAPPY TO TOUCH

00:38:40.118 --> 00:38:42.053 region:rollup2
ON THOSE?

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:43.755 region:rollup2
IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:44.756 region:rollup2
FIVE.

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:46.257 region:rollup2
AND THE SALUTE A LITTLE BIT

00:38:44.756 --> 00:38:46.925 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MAYBE THAN WHAT YOU'VE

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:48.126 region:rollup2
BEEN HEARING IN THE SUB

00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:50.962 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST FEW

00:38:48.126 --> 00:38:52.197 region:rollup2
YEARS ABOUT THE STATUS. OF THE

00:38:50.962 --> 00:38:53.431 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FINANCIALLY AND ITS

00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:54.933 region:rollup2
VARIOUS FUNDS.

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:57.702 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY

00:38:54.933 --> 00:38:59.437 region:rollup2
A SURPLUS PROJECTED FOR. TWO

00:38:57.702 --> 00:39:01.339 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:02.574 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE BEEN IN YOUR LOT

00:39:01.339 --> 00:39:03.775 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF.

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:04.943 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT DEFICITS

00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:06.511 region:rollup2
BUT SINCE THE RECYCLING RATE OF

00:39:04.943 --> 00:39:08.646 region:rollup2
HAS DECLINED OF ONE PERCENT

00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:10.515 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN THE RATE IS MORE THAN

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:11.950 region:rollup2
I'M TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S.

00:39:10.515 --> 00:39:12.851 region:rollup2
STAYING IN THIS PROGRAM AND SO

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.418 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GONE DOWN A LITTLE

00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:15.486 region:rollup2
BIT.

00:39:13.418 --> 00:39:15.987 region:rollup2
AMONGST OTHER THINGS WE SEE

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:16.888 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY.

00:39:15.987 --> 00:39:18.890 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR.

00:39:16.888 --> 00:39:20.291 region:rollup2
SO JUST

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:21.526 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR THERE'S MORE MONEY

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:23.728 region:rollup2
IN THE ACCOUNT BECAUSE THERE'S

00:39:21.526 --> 00:39:25.563 region:rollup2
LESS RECYCLING GOING ON.

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:26.297 region:rollup2
THAT IS WHAT THE MAIN

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:28.967 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:31.736 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE.

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:32.570 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY IF YOU LOOK AT

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:34.105 region:rollup2
THE LAST PAGE.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:36.040 region:rollup2
JUST TOUCHING ON SOME OF THE

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:38.376 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTER CLOSURES.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.644 region:rollup2
SINCE THE PEAK WOULDN'T WE HAD

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:42.146 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECYCLING CENTERS IN

00:39:39.644 --> 00:39:44.048 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. A ABOUT SIXTEEN

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:45.116 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SENATORS THE SIXTEEN

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:46.384 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FEWER CENTERS REGISTER

00:39:45.116 --> 00:39:47.619 region:rollup2
OF COLOR CYCLE TODAY THAN THERE

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:49.053 region:rollup2
WERE AT THAT TIME.

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:50.622 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:52.757 region:rollup2
DECLINE.

00:39:50.622 --> 00:39:54.325 region:rollup2
VARIOUS REASONS BUT THE MAIN

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:56.794 region:rollup2
ONES THAT WE FOUND WHERE THE

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
REDUCE RECYCLER REVENUES DUE TO

00:39:56.794 --> 00:40:01.065 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE. REALLY SIGNIFICANT

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:02.200 region:rollup2
DECLINES IN SCRAP VALUE THAT WE

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:03.901 region:rollup2
SAW IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.770 region:rollup2
SOME RECYCLERS DID SAY

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:07.338 region:rollup2
INCREASED OPERATING COSTS TIED

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.640 region:rollup2
TO THINGS LIKE THE MINIMUM WAGE

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:09.807 region:rollup2
ON SOME INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.242 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES AND

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:12.443 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF THING.

00:40:11.242 --> 00:40:15.046 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY THAT SOME OF

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.680 region:rollup2
THE THE PAYMENT FORMULAS COMING

00:40:15.046 --> 00:40:16.080 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE PROGRAM WERE ABLE TO

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.982 region:rollup2
KEEP.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.584 region:rollup2
PACE WITH SOME OF THOSE MORE

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:21.052 region:rollup2
QUICK MARKET CHANGES.

00:40:19.584 --> 00:40:22.086 region:rollup2
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT SMALL

00:40:21.052 --> 00:40:23.521 region:rollup2
ROLE RECYCLERS WERE PARTICULARLY

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:25.223 region:rollup2
AFFECTED LIKELY BECAUSE THEY

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:27.191 region:rollup2
HAVE A HIGHER PER CONTAINER COST

00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:28.459 region:rollup2
PER TRANSPORTATION COSTS

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.761 region:rollup2
UNUSUALLY LESS ECONOMIES OF

00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:31.095 region:rollup2
SCALE. ETCETERA.

00:40:29.761 --> 00:40:32.563 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.765 region:rollup2
SEVERAL REASONS THAT REDUCES

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:35.433 region:rollup2
CONSUMER CONVENIENCE TO GET

00:40:33.765 --> 00:40:36.100 region:rollup2
THERE ARE.

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:38.303 region:rollup2
DEPOSIT BACK.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:39.804 region:rollup2
IT CAN INCREASE RETAILER COST

00:40:38.303 --> 00:40:41.205 region:rollup2
THE RETAILER HAS A START TAKING

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:43.708 region:rollup2
THOSE CONTAINERS BACK OR PAYING

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:44.309 region:rollup2
THE. HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY THE

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:46.277 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM THEIR SPECIFIC

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:47.378 region:rollup2
PAYING. IF THEY DON'T HAVE A

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.980 region:rollup2
RECYCLE THEIR NOT TO IN THE

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:50.615 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS BACK. AND THEN

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.183 region:rollup2
FINALLY THAT POTENTIALLY FEWER

00:40:50.615 --> 00:40:52.717 region:rollup2
RIGID CONTAINERS ARE BEING

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.985 region:rollup2
RECYCLED.

00:40:52.717 --> 00:40:55.653 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SALAS CONVENIENT

00:40:53.985 --> 00:40:57.789 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE. TO BRING THE

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:59.223 region:rollup2
RECYCLING AND SAYS YOU NOTED

00:40:57.789 --> 00:41:00.825 region:rollup2
THAT THE RATE HAS DROPPED TO.

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:03.328 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:04.062 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE'RE WE'RE ROUGHLY

00:41:03.328 --> 00:41:05.663 region:rollup2
AROUND EIGHTY PERCENT.

00:41:04.062 --> 00:41:07.231 region:rollup2
SO THEN FINALLY JUST TO CONTINUE

00:41:05.663 --> 00:41:08.700 region:rollup2
THAT. THE STATE HOUSING AT A

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:09.701 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF THINGS TO TRY TO

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.903 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF THAT.

00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:13.004 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE IS WE DO HAVE A

00:41:11.903 --> 00:41:16.174 region:rollup2
BILL LAST YEAR THAT.

00:41:13.004 --> 00:41:17.542 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED SOME PILOT. PROJECTS

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:18.876 region:rollup2
FOR A MOBILE.

00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:20.078 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTERS TO TRY TO

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:20.645 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT

00:41:20.078 --> 00:41:22.513 region:rollup2
ARE NOW VERY UNDERSERVED ON

00:41:20.645 --> 00:41:23.948 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:25.683 region:rollup2
I THINK STILL THE INITIAL STAGES

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:26.584 region:rollup2
BUT GETTING UNDERWAY AND THEN

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:28.453 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY.

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:29.988 region:rollup2
CAO RECYCLE DID I IN ACTS

00:41:28.453 --> 00:41:30.621 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO TRY TO

00:41:29.988 --> 00:41:32.757 region:rollup2
ADDRESS.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:33.791 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE ROLE

00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:35.560 region:rollup2
CLOSURES BUT I'M SURE OF THAT

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:36.694 region:rollup2
TRACTORS ELABORATE ON THAT MORE

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:37.762 region:rollup2
THAN I CAN.

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:39.097 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO

00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:41.032 region:rollup2
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU

00:41:39.097 --> 00:41:44.736 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:47.739 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS.

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:48.873 region:rollup2
RETAIN.

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:50.308 region:rollup2
SO GOING BACK BACK IN MY OPENING

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:52.110 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WHAT DO YOU WHAT WOULD

00:41:50.308 --> 00:41:53.644 region:rollup2
IT TAKE FOR THE PROGRAM TO BE

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.980 region:rollup2
COMEY ZERO WAYS PROGRAM AT THAT

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:57.048 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.150 region:rollup2
THE PEAK OF EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT

00:41:57.048 --> 00:42:00.518 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.919 region:rollup2
BUT. THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT.

00:42:00.518 --> 00:42:03.488 region:rollup2
.

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:03.688 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT YOU CAN TRY TO ADDRESS

00:42:03.488 --> 00:42:05.556 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:06.958 region:rollup2
.

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:08.459 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK IF YOU IT

00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:09.727 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM HOUSE ONE

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:10.995 region:rollup2
OF THE RELATIVELY HIGHER

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:12.063 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATES OF SOME OF THE

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:13.464 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINER PROGRAMS

00:42:12.063 --> 00:42:16.267 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:17.168 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN. YOU

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.637 region:rollup2
KNOW PLACES I HAVE INCREASED

00:42:17.168 --> 00:42:20.905 region:rollup2
THEIR DEPOSIT A AMOUNT THAT'S

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:22.407 region:rollup2
TIED THE CONTAINERS THEY'VE

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:25.109 region:rollup2
USUALLY SEEN SOME KIND OF AN

00:42:22.407 --> 00:42:25.610 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN RECYCLING JUST

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.910 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE STRONGER

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.312 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:29.547 region:rollup2
.

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:31.182 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MAIN ONE

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:32.383 region:rollup2
THAT COMES TO MIND BUT CERTAINLY

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:33.718 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAT

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:35.286 region:rollup2
WOULD KIND OF AND YOU CLOSER TO

00:42:33.718 --> 00:42:37.155 region:rollup2
THAT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:38.956 region:rollup2
ALUMINUM AND STATE HAS BEEN AT

00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:41.526 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED PERCENT OR CLOSE TO IT

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:43.227 region:rollup2
BEFORE AND SO I FULLY TIED TO.

00:42:41.526 --> 00:42:44.195 region:rollup2
BUT THE SCOUT VALUES AND SO

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:45.029 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE HIGHER

00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:47.432 region:rollup2
VALUE WHEN THEY BRING IT BACK.

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:49.534 region:rollup2
.

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:50.501 region:rollup2
BUT. YOUNG JUST INCREASING

00:42:49.534 --> 00:42:52.437 region:rollup2
CONSUMER RECYCLING WOULD

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:54.472 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IT AS WELL AND

00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:56.441 region:rollup2
INCREASED THE RATE OVERALL.

00:42:54.472 --> 00:42:58.342 region:rollup2
SO GLASS A HIGHER VOLUME OF

00:42:56.441 --> 00:43:00.411 region:rollup2
WRIST AND ALUMINUM WHY DO YOU

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:02.413 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THEIR. RATES ARE SO

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:04.215 region:rollup2
LOW.

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:06.050 region:rollup2
FOR THE GLASS RECYCLING.

00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:07.985 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S FOR A FEW REASONS

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:09.220 region:rollup2
UP FIRST ALL IT'S HEAVIER.

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:10.955 region:rollup2
AND SO PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY I

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.824 region:rollup2
THINK TO TO BRING IT INTO THEIR

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:14.459 region:rollup2
STORAGE LARGER TO CARRY ITS ONLY

00:43:12.824 --> 00:43:16.160 region:rollup2
YOU CAN AND THAT. YOU CAN KIND

00:43:14.459 --> 00:43:18.329 region:rollup2
OF CRUNCH AND THEN I THINK

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.664 region:rollup2
SECONDLY IN IN. DRUGS OR

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:21.666 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE CAN ALSO PROBABLY.

00:43:19.664 --> 00:43:22.366 region:rollup2
I'D GET INTO THE NITTY DETAILS

00:43:21.666 --> 00:43:23.868 region:rollup2
ON THIS LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT IT

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:25.236 region:rollup2
IT WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH

00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:26.204 region:rollup2
IT BEING BROKE AND IN SOME OF

00:43:25.236 --> 00:43:29.474 region:rollup2
THE SINGLE.

00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:30.274 region:rollup2
SINGLE STREAM CURBSIDE AND SO

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:31.075 region:rollup2
THAT CAN CAUSE.

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:32.343 region:rollup2
THE GLASS NOT EVER MAKE IT

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:39.150 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTER OR TO HAVE TO

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:41.185 region:rollup2
BE DISPOSED OF.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:42.220 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:44.088 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:46.290 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION WERE GOING TO TAKE

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:46.791 region:rollup2
ROLE NOW AND THEN PROBABLY

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.960 region:rollup2
RECESSED FOR A COUPLE OF

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.728 region:rollup2
MINUTES.

WE'LL TAKE. ROLL SLOWLY.

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:03.307 region:rollup2
SILICON HELPS THAT OUT.

OTHER ITEMS SO HONORED GENDER

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.897 region:rollup2
SEVERAL PANELS I SHOULD SAY. OF.

00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:21.665 region:rollup2

PACKAGING RECYCLING. OUR MISSION

00:54:31.435 --> 00:54:33.837 region:rollup2
IS TO MAKE NORTH AMERICA GLOBAL

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:35.906 region:rollup2
MODEL FOR THE COLLECTION AND

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:37.508 region:rollup2
QUALITY RECYCLING OF PACKAGING

00:54:35.906 --> 00:54:39.476 region:rollup2
MATERIALS. AND AS WE DO OUR

00:54:37.508 --> 00:54:40.711 region:rollup2

THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR A

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:45.482 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES WERE LOOKING FOR.

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:47.551 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU GET THE HIGHEST

00:54:45.482 --> 00:54:49.553 region:rollup2
QUALITY RECYCLING THE HIGHEST

00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:51.455 region:rollup2
QUANTITY OF RECYCLING AT THE

00:54:49.553 --> 00:54:54.224 region:rollup2
LOWEST COST AND AGAIN JUST FOCUS

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:55.526 region:rollup2
ON ON PACKAGING MATERIALS BUT IF

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:56.760 region:rollup2
YOU CAN IT IT WAS JUST STRIVE TO

00:54:55.526 --> 00:54:58.862 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THOSE THREE THAT SORT OF

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:00.397 region:rollup2
RECYCLING NIRVANA HIGH QUALITY

00:54:58.862 --> 00:55:01.565 region:rollup2
HIGH QUALITY LOW COST?

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:03.267 region:rollup2
SO A LITTLE BIT OF AN

00:55:01.565 --> 00:55:04.301 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HERE

00:55:03.267 --> 00:55:04.968 region:rollup2
ON BEVERAGE CONTAINER DEPOSIT

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:06.770 region:rollup2
LAWS.

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:08.839 region:rollup2
.

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:10.841 region:rollup2
IT'S INCREDIBLE THE GROWTH THAT

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:12.676 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:14.178 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD TO SINCERE TWO

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:16.647 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIVE. THERE'VE BEEN

00:55:14.178 --> 00:55:18.182 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN NEW DEPOSIT LAS

00:55:16.647 --> 00:55:20.184 region:rollup2
SERVING MORE THAN A HUNDRED

00:55:18.182 --> 00:55:22.119 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD

00:55:20.184 --> 00:55:23.554 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS A VERY MUCH A GROWING

00:55:22.119 --> 00:55:25.856 region:rollup2
AND.

00:55:23.554 --> 00:55:27.124 region:rollup2
TOPIC AND THEY'RE PICKING UP IN

00:55:25.856 --> 00:55:29.526 region:rollup2
A BIG WAY IN EUROPE AND

00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:31.261 region:rollup2
AUSTRALIA. AND WE'RE HEARING NOW

00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:32.596 region:rollup2
THAT THE U. N. IN THE G. SEVEN

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:34.565 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO LOOKING AT DEVELOPING

00:55:32.596 --> 00:55:36.300 region:rollup2
NATIONS. AND THE ISSUE THAT YOU

00:55:34.565 --> 00:55:38.468 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP CHAIRMAN BLOOM ABOUT

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:40.971 region:rollup2
SAM PLASTIC IN THE OCEAN THE

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:44.408 region:rollup2
MARINE DEBRIS ISSUE. IS A HUGE

00:55:40.971 --> 00:55:44.908 region:rollup2
DRIVER OF THESE CONTAINERS POSIT

00:55:44.408 --> 00:55:46.443 region:rollup2
LAWS AROUND THE WORLD.

00:55:44.908 --> 00:55:46.877 region:rollup2
ALSO IN THE UNITED STATES THIS

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:49.213 region:rollup2
IS JUST.

00:55:46.877 --> 00:55:51.281 region:rollup2
NEW LEGISLATION HAS BEEN

00:55:49.213 --> 00:55:53.350 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:56.119 region:rollup2
WERE DOING RESEARCH AND

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:58.021 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ON. A MORE THAN TWO

00:55:56.119 --> 00:56:00.357 region:rollup2
DOZEN BILLS IN.

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:01.959 region:rollup2
ABOUT A DOZEN STATES

00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:03.327 region:rollup2
AT THROUGHOUT THE US SO IT'S

00:56:01.959 --> 00:56:04.661 region:rollup2
IT'S A TOPIC THAT'S RECEIVING A

00:56:03.327 --> 00:56:05.295 region:rollup2
LOT OF ATTENTION NOT JUST

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:07.731 region:rollup2
HEARING CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND

00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:10.767 region:rollup2
THE U. S..

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:12.236 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM.

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:13.370 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING A LOT

00:56:12.236 --> 00:56:14.638 region:rollup2
ABOUT PROBLEMS TODAY BUT I DON'T

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.039 region:rollup2
WANT TO OVERLOOK THE INCREDIBLE

00:56:14.638 --> 00:56:17.741 region:rollup2
SUCCESS

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:19.076 region:rollup2
AND IT IS A PROGRAM THAT STILL

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:21.178 region:rollup2
HAS A SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT

00:56:19.076 --> 00:56:22.512 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE WHICH IS AMAZING

00:56:21.178 --> 00:56:24.848 region:rollup2
FOR RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:26.583 region:rollup2
GENERAL. AND THE BIGGEST PROGRAM

00:56:24.848 --> 00:56:28.885 region:rollup2
FOR CONTAINER DEPOSITS IS IN

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:31.388 region:rollup2
GERMANY CALIFORNIA IS THE SECOND

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:34.157 region:rollup2
LARGEST PROGRAM IN THE WORLD.

00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:36.593 region:rollup2
AM AND DAD THAT WILL HOLD UNLESS

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:37.828 region:rollup2
THE U. K. A TOPS AND THE DEPOSIT

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:39.529 region:rollup2
LA THEN NOPE THE PUMP IS DOWN TO

00:56:37.828 --> 00:56:41.098 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE FROM

00:56:39.529 --> 00:56:42.399 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO.

00:56:41.098 --> 00:56:45.502 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT HAS

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:46.870 region:rollup2
RECEIVED A LOT OF CONVERSATION

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:48.005 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THE

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:49.873 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION OF STRUCTURAL

00:56:48.005 --> 00:56:52.542 region:rollup2
DEFICITS.

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:54.344 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD REALLY A NOT BE

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:57.381 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING THAT A LOT TODAY.

00:56:54.344 --> 00:57:00.150 region:rollup2
AND THE PROGRAM ACHIEVED A

00:56:57.381 --> 00:57:02.019 region:rollup2
SURPLUS IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR.

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:03.420 region:rollup2
OF FORTY FOUR MILLION IT'S GOING

00:57:02.019 --> 00:57:04.788 region:rollup2
TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.556 region:rollup2
FROM FROM THAT IN.

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.658 region:rollup2
CAO RECYCLES QUARTERLY REPORT

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:09.192 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS A THIRTY FOUR

00:57:07.658 --> 00:57:10.994 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS PLUS

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:12.729 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:14.264 region:rollup2
INTERNAL TRANSFERS SO DOESN'T

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:15.632 region:rollup2
SHOW UP IN THE MAIN FUND BUT IT

00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:17.401 region:rollup2
WAS JUST MOVING MONEY FROM ONE

00:57:15.632 --> 00:57:19.403 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER.

00:57:17.401 --> 00:57:21.371 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER BETWEEN THE FUND

00:57:19.403 --> 00:57:23.106 region:rollup2
BALANCE IN THE MAIN FUND AND THE

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:24.841 region:rollup2
FUND BALANCES AND THE OTHER FOR

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:26.710 region:rollup2
FUNDS THERE'S MORE THAN THREE

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:28.045 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.947 region:rollup2
IN FUND BALANCE.

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:31.281 region:rollup2
SO.

00:57:29.947 --> 00:57:32.382 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT IT YOU KNOW YOU THAT

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:34.217 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT A PLACE WHERE YOU

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:34.785 region:rollup2
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IS THERE

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:36.153 region:rollup2
ENOUGH MONEY TO DO WHAT YOU

00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:37.187 region:rollup2
WANNA DO.

00:57:36.153 --> 00:57:38.655 region:rollup2
THE THING THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.423 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS AN IS

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:41.625 region:rollup2
THERE ENOUGH MONEY THAT'S A

00:57:39.423 --> 00:57:46.930 region:rollup2
DISTRACTION WE SHOULD BE TALKING

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:48.865 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE WANNA DO.

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:50.033 region:rollup2
AND HERE'S THE BIG BIG TOPIC

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:51.335 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPORTANT

00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:53.270 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:57:51.335 --> 00:57:55.205 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:57.007 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:58.608 region:rollup2
SINCE THE PEAK IN TWENTY

00:57:57.007 --> 00:58:00.977 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

00:57:58.608 --> 00:58:05.682 region:rollup2
NEARLY ONE THOUSAND REDEMPTION

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:06.550 region:rollup2
CENTERS HAVE CLOSED.

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.884 region:rollup2
THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR A WHOLE

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.919 region:rollup2
BUNCH IT FOR REASONS AND ONE OF

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:10.921 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THEY WANT YOU TO

00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:12.289 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON IN THIS CHART IT'S A

00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:14.091 region:rollup2
LITTLE HARD TO SEE BUT THE

00:58:12.289 --> 00:58:15.759 region:rollup2
STEEPEST PART OF THE. DECLINE

00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:17.728 region:rollup2
OCCURRED BETWEEN MID TWENTY

00:58:15.759 --> 00:58:19.029 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND MID TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:20.864 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE SEVERAL MORE CHARTS

00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:22.432 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GONNA EXPLAIN WHY THIS

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:24.201 region:rollup2
HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED. AND

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:25.836 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHY IT HAPPENED

00:58:24.201 --> 00:58:28.238 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENED ARE ABSOLUTELY

00:58:25.836 --> 00:58:29.272 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENTAL. FOR US TO KNOW

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:32.042 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SHOULD DO TO FIX THESE

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:34.678 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:58:32.042 --> 00:58:36.246 region:rollup2
SO. BRIEFLY READING FROM TOP TO

00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:37.914 region:rollup2
BOTTOM IN EACH OF THESE COLUMNS

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:39.316 region:rollup2
THE COST OF RECYCLING IS THE

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:41.585 region:rollup2
COST THAT THE REDEMPTION CENTERS

00:58:39.316 --> 00:58:43.019 region:rollup2
BEAR THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:44.421 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF REVENUE.

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:47.557 region:rollup2
THE PROCESSING PAYMENT THAT THEY

00:58:44.421 --> 00:58:48.925 region:rollup2
RECEIVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT.

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:50.594 region:rollup2
AND THE SCRAP VALUE THEY RECEIVE

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:52.429 region:rollup2
AND THOSE TWO THINGS ARE

00:58:50.594 --> 00:58:53.563 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO MAKE THEM WHOLE. YOU

00:58:52.429 --> 00:58:56.600 region:rollup2
CAN SEE IN THE MAY TWENTY

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:58.368 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN COLUMN THIS IS FOR P. ET

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.936 region:rollup2
THEY HAD A COST OF ABOUT FOUR

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:01.505 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS A TON. AND

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
THE TO PAYMENTS THAT THEY WERE

00:59:01.505 --> 00:59:05.475 region:rollup2
GETTING. WASN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:06.777 region:rollup2
THEM WHOLE THEY WERE THEY WERE

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:09.413 region:rollup2
RECEIVING A SHORT FALL.

00:59:06.777 --> 00:59:11.448 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE DOLLARS ON EVERYTIME

00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:12.682 region:rollup2
OF P. ET THAT THEY HANDLE.

00:59:11.448 --> 00:59:13.850 region:rollup2
DID THE EXACT NUMBERS ARE AN

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:15.452 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT HERE IT'S JUST TO

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.454 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATE THIS IS HOW THEY GET

00:59:15.452 --> 00:59:18.722 region:rollup2
PAID AND THIS IS HOW GET THE.

00:59:17.454 --> 00:59:20.257 region:rollup2
THEY WERE GETTING PAID AND IT

00:59:18.722 --> 00:59:22.192 region:rollup2
WASN'T WORKING IT WAS LOSING THE

00:59:20.257 --> 00:59:24.094 region:rollup2
MONEY AND EVERY TIME THE HANDLE.

00:59:22.192 --> 00:59:25.695 region:rollup2
ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCRAP

00:59:24.094 --> 00:59:27.297 region:rollup2
VALUES TRENDING DOWN SINCE TWO

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:28.799 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE THIS IS A

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:29.766 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY EXTERNAL SOURCES IS

00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:31.368 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT NOBODY IN THE

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:33.070 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ANY

00:59:31.368 --> 00:59:34.738 region:rollup2
CONTROL OVER. BUT IT IS

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:36.073 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WHAT WE CAN CONTROL IS

00:59:34.738 --> 00:59:37.240 region:rollup2
HOW WE REACT TO IT.

00:59:36.073 --> 00:59:39.409 region:rollup2
SO THE SCRAP VALUES WERE

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.044 region:rollup2
DECLINING FOR P. ET FOR ALUMINUM

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:43.080 region:rollup2
CANS AND FOR GLASS AND HERE'S

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:44.414 region:rollup2
THE KEY. IT ALL HAPPENED AT THE

00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.415 region:rollup2
SAME TIME.

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:46.850 region:rollup2
IF ONE OF THESE THINGS HAVE

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:48.285 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.487 region:rollup2
THE REDEMPTION CENTERS MIGHT OF

00:59:48.285 --> 00:59:52.589 region:rollup2
WEATHER DOT PROBLEM.

00:59:50.487 --> 00:59:54.825 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE IN THE DATE THAT THE

00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:56.560 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS CLOSED

00:59:54.825 --> 00:59:57.694 region:rollup2
IT CORRELATES VERY STRONGLY TO

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.229 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN TWENTY

00:59:57.694 --> 01:00:00.163 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN LOOK

00:59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.932 region:rollup2
AT THE CHART ON THE RIGHT

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:03.700 region:rollup2
ALUMINUM CANS. YOU CAN SEE

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:05.635 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONE PART OF THAT CHART

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:07.737 region:rollup2
WHERE THE LINE DECLINES

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:09.306 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY THEIR STE IT JUST

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:11.108 region:rollup2
FALLS OFF OF A CLIFF.

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.876 region:rollup2
THAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE SAME

01:00:11.108 --> 01:00:15.011 region:rollup2
TIME THAT THE P. T. PRICES WERE

01:00:12.876 --> 01:00:16.079 region:rollup2
FALLING OFF A CLIFF.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:18.415 region:rollup2
NOW HERE IN THIS NEXT CHART

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:20.484 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO LINES HERE.

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:21.685 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL SCRAP VALUE IS WHAT

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:23.153 region:rollup2
THE REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:25.589 region:rollup2
PAYING.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:28.225 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE DOTTED LINE.

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:29.226 region:rollup2
THE. BULLS LINE THE FILLED IN

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.694 region:rollup2
LINE ON THE TOP OF EACH OF THESE

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:33.163 region:rollup2
GRAPHS.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:34.064 region:rollup2
IS WHAT CAL RECYCLES FORMULA

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:36.199 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:38.201 region:rollup2
PAID TO THE GAP IN BETWEEN THOSE

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:39.135 region:rollup2
LINES IS WHERE THE REDEMPTION

01:00:38.201 --> 01:00:41.004 region:rollup2
CENTERS WERE EXPERIENCING A

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.272 region:rollup2
SHORTFALL. AND AGAIN YOU CAN SEE

01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:44.975 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST GAPS

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:46.409 region:rollup2
OCCURRING FOR P. ET AND GLASS IN

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.677 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:49.112 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN TIME PERIOD AND THAT'S

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:50.514 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHEN THE REDEMPTION

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:52.682 region:rollup2
CENTERS.

01:00:50.514 --> 01:00:53.583 region:rollup2
WERE ALSO RECEIVING LESS MONEY

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:54.417 region:rollup2
FROM ALUMINUM BECAUSE THE

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.919 region:rollup2
ALUMINUM PRICES IT FALLING OFF A

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:58.955 region:rollup2
CLIFF.

01:00:55.919 --> 01:01:00.257 region:rollup2
SO OF THESE THOUSAND CENTERS

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:02.092 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE CLOSED OVER THIS FIVE

01:01:00.257 --> 01:01:03.393 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD.

01:01:02.092 --> 01:01:04.794 region:rollup2
ALMOST HALF OF THEM FOUR HUNDRED

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:06.830 region:rollup2
FIFTY SIX OF THEM CLOSED IN A

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:08.231 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.032 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS THAT THAT TERRIBLE

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:09.799 region:rollup2
PERIOD WHERE ALL THE PRICES

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:12.035 region:rollup2
DECLINED.

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:14.504 region:rollup2
SO.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:15.705 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THAT THIS

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.907 region:rollup2
PROGRAM DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:18.175 region:rollup2
THAT IT NEEDED TO ADDRESS THAT

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:19.543 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THE PROBLEM OCCURRED

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:21.111 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY AND THERE WAS NO

01:01:19.543 --> 01:01:22.646 region:rollup2
WAY TO SOLVE IT? BUT THE PROBLEM

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:23.747 region:rollup2
ALSO OCCURRED BEFORE THAT TIME

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:24.814 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND AFTER THAT TIME

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:26.383 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:28.652 region:rollup2
TOOLS TO ADDRESS THAT EITHER

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:31.154 region:rollup2
EXCEPT FOR THE RECENT EMERGENCY

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:32.889 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS THAT CAME ABOUT.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.523 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN BLOOM YOU LOOKED LIKE

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:34.758 region:rollup2
YOU HAD A QUESTION SHOULD I STOP

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:36.326 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:37.694 region:rollup2
HER I WAS SET PONDERING WHETHER

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:39.729 region:rollup2
TO ASK YOU WHAT THOSE TOOLS ARE

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:40.730 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED. BUT I HAVE A

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.164 region:rollup2
FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:43.400 region:rollup2
THAT I'M AVERAGE I.

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:45.502 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.037 region:rollup2
IT SO IT DID THIS IS SORT OF A

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:48.572 region:rollup2
RESTATEMENT OF THE SAME THING IT

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:50.273 region:rollup2
SHOWS HOW MUCH THE REDEMPTION

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.442 region:rollup2
CENTERS WERE UNDERPAID. EACH

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:54.077 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR YOU KNOW THAT FIVE YEAR

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:55.579 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND THEN HERE IT IS

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:57.280 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVELY.

01:01:55.579 --> 01:01:58.748 region:rollup2
SO IF A REDEMPTION CENTER WAS

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.750 region:rollup2
EXISTING AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:02.519 region:rollup2
TIME AND THEY WERE ABLE TO STICK

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.887 region:rollup2
IT OUT THROUGH LOSING A LOT OF

01:02:02.519 --> 01:02:06.022 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:07.824 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY TWELVE TWENTY

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:09.593 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:13.229 region:rollup2
ONE THING BUT THEN THE

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:14.998 region:rollup2
CUMULATIVE LOSSES MOUNTED. AND

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.999 region:rollup2
OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME THOSE

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:18.134 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS WERE

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:19.769 region:rollup2
UNDERPAID BY A TOTAL OF SIXTY

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.804 region:rollup2
TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:22.973 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF THAT MAKES IT

01:02:20.804 --> 01:02:25.242 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY OBVIOUS WHY WE LOST A

01:02:22.973 --> 01:02:27.410 region:rollup2
THOUSAND REDEMPTION CENTERS.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:28.912 region:rollup2
THERE IS SOME ADDITIONAL CLOSING

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.547 region:rollup2
OF REDEMPTION CENTERS THAT

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:32.148 region:rollup2
HAPPENED BECAUSE.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:33.984 region:rollup2
I THEY BASICALLY BEEN EVICTED BY

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:34.584 region:rollup2
THEIR LANDLORDS OR THE

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.585 region:rollup2
SUPERMARKETS THAT ARE HOSTING

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.087 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.488 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:40.256 region:rollup2
THOSE THOUSAND WERE CLOSED IN

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:41.291 region:rollup2
THAT WAY. BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:45.996 region:rollup2
PART OF IT.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:48.832 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:51.134 region:rollup2
SO AN ENCOUNTER CYCLE.

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:52.969 region:rollup2
INCLUDED A STATEMENT IN THEIR

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:55.405 region:rollup2
QUARTERLY REPORT THIS LAST TIME

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.939 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY SAID WE REALLY DON'T

01:02:55.405 --> 01:02:57.240 region:rollup2
HAVE TOOLS TO ADDRESS THIS

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.944 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL TAKE

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:02.278 region:rollup2
THAT VERY SERIOUSLY THAT.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:03.546 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE THEY NEED

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:05.382 region:rollup2
HELP FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:05.949 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:08.585 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO ADDRESS THIS

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:10.587 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:12.756 region:rollup2
SO.

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:16.593 region:rollup2
WHEN WHAT THE KEY THING ABOUT

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:18.995 region:rollup2
ANY DEPOSIT PROGRAM IS THAT.

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:20.130 region:rollup2
THERE EXISTS A SOCIAL CONTRACT.

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:21.865 region:rollup2
TWEEN THE STATE AND THE

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:23.800 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:25.001 region:rollup2
THE STATE PUTS THE LINE PLACE

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.437 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS IF YOU RETURN THIS

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.004 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINER WILL MAKE

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:28.305 region:rollup2
SURE THAT YOU GET YOUR FIVE

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.973 region:rollup2
CENTS BACK.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:33.209 region:rollup2
AND.

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:34.544 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMERS ARE OWED THAT

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:36.212 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEIR FIVE

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:38.081 region:rollup2
CENTS BACK.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:39.849 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE DON'T HAVE REDEMPTION

01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:41.785 region:rollup2
CENTERS IN ENTIRE COUNTIES.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:43.687 region:rollup2
AND INDEED THEIR SEVENTEEN

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:44.521 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT HAVE EITHER ZERO

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:45.555 region:rollup2
OR ONE OR TWO OR THREE

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:48.925 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:49.492 region:rollup2
.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.894 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BROKEN THE SOCIAL

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:52.329 region:rollup2
CONTRACT. FOR TELLING THE

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:54.464 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS TO DO SOMETHING AND

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.065 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOWING THEM WHAT THEY NEED

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:56.766 region:rollup2
THE ACCESS TO RECYCLING TO DO

01:03:55.065 --> 01:03:57.967 region:rollup2
IT.

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.636 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PART OF THE SOCIAL

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:01.137 region:rollup2
CONTRACT IS.

01:03:59.636 --> 01:04:02.038 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL RECYCLE THIS

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:03.707 region:rollup2
PRODUCT.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:06.276 region:rollup2
.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:07.343 region:rollup2
THE AT THE EXPECTATION.

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:10.647 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT VERY IMPORTANT.

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:12.582 region:rollup2
VERY IMPORTANT.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:14.084 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT NOW NOT ONLY HAVE WE

01:04:12.582 --> 01:04:15.618 region:rollup2
LOST THESE THOUSAND AND

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:17.253 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS BUT THE

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.388 region:rollup2
POPULATION IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:19.689 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS AGO PEOPLE ARE

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.824 region:rollup2
CONSUMING MORE BEVERAGE

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.692 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS THAN THEY WERE A FEW

01:04:20.824 --> 01:04:25.361 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO SO THIS MEANS WE ARE

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:26.896 region:rollup2
RETURNING MORE CONTAINERS.

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.164 region:rollup2
PER PERSON AND WE HAVE MORE

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:29.799 region:rollup2
PEOPLE RETURNING CONTAINERS THAN

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:32.902 region:rollup2
EVER BEFORE.

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:34.537 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE HAVE FEWER CENTERS.

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:36.306 region:rollup2
SO THIS CHART IS LOOKING AT IT

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:38.775 region:rollup2
FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:40.310 region:rollup2
THIS SAYS WELL HOW MANY PEOPLE

01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:41.478 region:rollup2
ARE SERVED BY EACH REDEMPTION

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:43.246 region:rollup2
CENTER.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:44.381 region:rollup2
AND WE REACHED A POINT WHERE IT

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:46.349 region:rollup2
WAS AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:48.051 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:49.385 region:rollup2
SERVED BY EACH REDEMPTION CENTER

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:51.287 region:rollup2
NOW IT'S MORE LIKE TWENTY FIVE

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:53.590 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVED BY EACH

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:55.625 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTER.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:57.060 region:rollup2
SO THE REDEMPTION CENTERS.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:59.796 region:rollup2
ARE MORE CROWDED THERE'S MORE

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.430 region:rollup2
TRAFFIC THAT'S A BIGGER IMPACT

01:04:59.796 --> 01:05:01.531 region:rollup2
ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.299 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:05.668 region:rollup2
AND IT MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:07.871 region:rollup2
WAIT IN LINE LONGER. UP WITH THE

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:09.005 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN MINIMUM WAGE

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE COST OF THE

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.708 region:rollup2
CENTERS AND THE FACT THAT

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:13.943 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALREADY THE CENTERS ARE

01:05:11.708 --> 01:05:15.311 region:rollup2
ALREADY FINANCIALLY BELEAGUERED.

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:17.313 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE CUT THE HOURS THEIR

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:19.149 region:rollup2
CENTERS ARE OPEN AGAIN SQUEEZING

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:20.417 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AND MORE

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:21.818 region:rollup2
AND MORE CONTAINERS.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:23.820 region:rollup2
INTO A SPACE THAT WAS NEVER

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:25.088 region:rollup2
DESIGNED PHYSICALLY A SPACE THAT

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:27.590 region:rollup2
WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO ACCEPT

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:28.191 region:rollup2
THAT MANY CONTAINERS.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.893 region:rollup2
AND WHAT ARE THEY DESIGNED TO.

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:31.461 region:rollup2
TO.

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:33.596 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DESIGNED SEVERAL YEARS

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:36.132 region:rollup2
AGO TO HANDLE YOU KNOW SIXTEEN

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:37.367 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AT PEOPLE PER CENTER

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:39.102 region:rollup2
NOT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SO EACH

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:40.837 region:rollup2
CENTER IS RECEIVING ABOUT FIFTY

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:42.505 region:rollup2
PERCENT MORE CONTAINERS THAN

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:44.240 region:rollup2
THEY WERE BEFORE.

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:45.408 region:rollup2
I AM SO YOU CAN IMAGINE.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:49.012 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON THEIR

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:51.448 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT.

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:53.016 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE ISSUE

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.450 region:rollup2
OF THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:56.786 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED THE

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:59.389 region:rollup2
ANALOGY. ANALOGY I WILL MAKE IS

01:05:56.786 --> 01:06:01.124 region:rollup2
THAT. IF YOUR HOUSE IS ON FIRE

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:02.692 region:rollup2
PUT OUT THE FIRE AND THEN TALK

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.760 region:rollup2
LATER ABOUT REDECORATING.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.828 region:rollup2
SO WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING ANY

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.129 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS TODAY ABOUT

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:07.764 region:rollup2
REDECORATING ALL OF OUR

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:09.566 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SHOULD BE FOCUSED

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:11.334 region:rollup2
TOWARD THIS MAIN MAIN ISSUE

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:12.836 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE TO REBUILD

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:14.437 region:rollup2
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:15.572 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA SO THAT CONSUMERS

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:20.109 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO RETURN THEIR

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:21.811 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS.

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:23.446 region:rollup2
SO TO HEAR STICKING A DEEPER

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:25.315 region:rollup2
DIVE INTO.

01:06:23.446 --> 01:06:26.316 region:rollup2
HOW ONE MATERIAL TYPE HAS BEEN

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.251 region:rollup2
AFFECTED BECAUSE IT'S BEEN

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.486 region:rollup2
AFFECTED MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.721 region:rollup2
MAJOR MATERIAL TYPES THIS THIS

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:34.157 region:rollup2
DATA IS FOR GLASS?

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:36.125 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SEEING?

01:06:34.157 --> 01:06:37.393 region:rollup2
IS THE WE HAVE THE GENERAL

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:39.095 region:rollup2
STATISTIC THAT THE CURRENT

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:40.763 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE IS SEVENTY SEVEN

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:42.632 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND WE KNOW THAT DIETS

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:44.033 region:rollup2
FIVE TO SEVEN POINTS LOWER.

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:46.302 region:rollup2
THEN IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO.

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:47.770 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.972 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE OVERALL RECYCLING

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.341 region:rollup2
RATE IT DOESN'T REFLECT THE

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:53.109 region:rollup2
SHIPS.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:55.245 region:rollup2
OF THE MATERIALS FROM. AT THE

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:56.446 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS TO CURB SIDE

01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:58.548 region:rollup2
AND FOR GLASS IT'S BEEN

01:06:56.446 --> 01:07:00.817 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:03.319 region:rollup2
AT THE GREEN BAR THERE SHOWS

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:04.954 region:rollup2
THAT AND CLASS IS GONE DOWN BY

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:06.523 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT THAT.

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.824 region:rollup2
FROM FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:10.093 region:rollup2
TIMES DOWN TO FOUR HUNDRED

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:11.761 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE THOUSAND TONS GOING

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:13.263 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS.

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:15.565 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SUPER CLEAN HIGH

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:17.433 region:rollup2
QUALITY GLASS.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:18.601 region:rollup2
INSTEAD A BUNCH OF THAT GLASS

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.969 region:rollup2
HAS GONE TO THE LANDFILL OF

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:22.105 region:rollup2
COURSE.

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:23.706 region:rollup2
A AND THAT'S YOU CAN SEE THAT IN

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:25.408 region:rollup2
THE BLACK LINE ON THE TOP.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.910 region:rollup2
BUT THE BLUE LINE SHOWS THAT A

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:27.977 region:rollup2
BUNCH THAT GLASS WAS ALSO

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:30.747 region:rollup2
ABSORBED BY.

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:32.315 region:rollup2
SINGLE STREET CURBSIDE PROGRAMS

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:34.717 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE GLASS THAT IS

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:36.219 region:rollup2
MORE CONTAMINATED AND IS WORTH

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.788 region:rollup2
LESS IN DOLLAR VALUES.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:39.889 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU SHIFT THE GLASS OUT

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:42.025 region:rollup2
OF THE HIGH DOLLAR VALUE

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:44.661 region:rollup2
CATEGORY INTO THE LOWER DOLLAR

01:07:42.025 --> 01:07:46.362 region:rollup2
VALUE CATEGORY. THAT AVERAGE

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:48.331 region:rollup2
PRICE FOR GLASS GOES DOWN AND

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:48.798 region:rollup2
THE PROCESSING PAYMENT PASSED TO

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:50.900 region:rollup2
GO UP TO MAKE UP THAT

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:52.435 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:54.704 region:rollup2
SO HERE ALL OF THE IMPLICATIONS

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:56.172 region:rollup2
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO GLASS.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:58.141 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMERS ARE GETTING LAST

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:59.909 region:rollup2
REFUNDS AN ACROSS THE BOARD FOR

01:07:58.141 --> 01:08:00.543 region:rollup2
ALL MATERIALS IT'S IT'S

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:03.179 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF FORTY

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.681 region:rollup2
TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:05.315 region:rollup2
THAT CONSUMERS ARE GETTING

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.215 region:rollup2
THAT'S LESS THAN WHAT THEY USED

01:08:05.315 --> 01:08:07.784 region:rollup2
TO AT.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.985 region:rollup2
AND IT MADE EVEN BE BE A LITTLE

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:10.553 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THAT OF AYE

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:11.788 region:rollup2
RECALCULATE.

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:13.590 region:rollup2
THE REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE

01:08:11.788 --> 01:08:15.258 region:rollup2
GETTING LESS MATERIAL.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.125 region:rollup2
THE MERCK'S ARE GETTING MORE

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:18.394 region:rollup2
GLASS AND THEY DON'T WANT MORE

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:20.196 region:rollup2
GLASS.

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:21.564 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY IS LOWER.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:23.933 region:rollup2
SO THE PROCESSORS AND THE

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:25.735 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO EITHER

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.870 region:rollup2
HAVE HIGHER COSTS.

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:29.672 region:rollup2
OR THEY GET LESS MATERIAL WHICH

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:31.874 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO MAKE RECYCLED

01:08:29.672 --> 01:08:33.576 region:rollup2
CONTENT PRODUCTS.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:35.812 region:rollup2
ALL THE WHILE THE FUND IS

01:08:33.576 --> 01:08:37.547 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PAYING MORE.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:39.882 region:rollup2
TO GET LAST CLASS AND LOWER

01:08:37.547 --> 01:08:40.483 region:rollup2
COSTS QUALITY GLASS AND THE

01:08:39.882 --> 01:08:40.917 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS ARE PAYING MORE

01:08:40.483 --> 01:08:42.185 region:rollup2
TO.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:44.087 region:rollup2
SO NO ONE WINS HERE.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:46.055 region:rollup2
NO ONE WENT

01:08:44.087 --> 01:08:47.924 region:rollup2
SO THOUGH ON GLASS THOSE OF THE

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:49.292 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES WHETHER WHAT OF THE

01:08:47.924 --> 01:08:50.560 region:rollup2
PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THOSE

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.794 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.996 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY MADE A GOOD

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:54.530 region:rollup2
POINT WHEN SHE SAID WITH THE

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:55.832 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS CLOSING IF

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.1000 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE GONNA TRAVEL FARTHER

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.601 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T

01:08:56.1000 --> 01:09:00.303 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:01.404 region:rollup2
I IF THERE IF ON A BIKE IF THERE

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.572 region:rollup2
ON FOOT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:03.673 region:rollup2
CARRY THE HAVE YOUR CLASS

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:05.775 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THE ALUMINUM

01:09:03.673 --> 01:09:08.411 region:rollup2
IN THE P. ET AND FOR RECYCLING.

01:09:05.775 --> 01:09:09.946 region:rollup2
SO I'M ALL OF THE RATES ARE DOWN

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:11.614 region:rollup2
INCLUDING GLASS BUT I THINK

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:12.982 region:rollup2
GLASS SUFFERS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:15.318 region:rollup2
THAN THE OTHER MATERIAL TYPES IN

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:17.320 region:rollup2
THAT SCENARIO.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:18.921 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN I THINK TO YOUR

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:19.989 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE ANSWER IS MORE

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:22.091 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS IN MORE

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:24.293 region:rollup2
PLACES.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:24.861 region:rollup2
AND I DO HAVE A SLIDE HERE AND

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:25.995 region:rollup2
HOW IT'S AFFECTED DIFFERENT

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:27.997 region:rollup2
PLACES.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:29.966 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE RURAL

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:31.234 region:rollup2
COUNTIES SUFFERING A LOT AND

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.769 region:rollup2
LOSING REDEMPTION CENTERS TO THE

01:09:31.234 --> 01:09:35.038 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE SOME OF THEM HAVE NO

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:37.607 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS AT ALL.

01:09:35.038 --> 01:09:38.574 region:rollup2
THE PLACES THAT HAVE HIGH RENT.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:39.676 region:rollup2
HAVE ALSO LOST REDEMPTION

01:09:38.574 --> 01:09:40.309 region:rollup2
CENTERS YOU CAN IMAGINE OF

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:42.078 region:rollup2
COURSE THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:44.147 region:rollup2
HIGHER COSTS.

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:46.883 region:rollup2
SO I THINK.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:49.152 region:rollup2
EIGHT OUT OF THE TEN HARDEST HIT

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:51.120 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THE ONES THAT HAVE MOST

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:52.855 region:rollup2
SCARCE REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE IN

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.157 region:rollup2
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:55.758 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS RESULT I DIDN'T

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:57.527 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO FIND WHEN WE CRUNCH

01:09:55.758 --> 01:10:00.363 region:rollup2
THESE NUMBERS.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:02.699 region:rollup2
AND THE PERCENTAGE LOST.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:04.333 region:rollup2
I THINK AM SEVENTEEN OUT OF

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:06.102 region:rollup2
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:07.136 region:rollup2
HAVE LOST MORE THAN FIFTY

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:08.905 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE REDEMPTION

01:10:07.136 --> 01:10:11.374 region:rollup2
CENTERS.

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:13.076 region:rollup2
SO. THE LOSSES.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:15.144 region:rollup2
ARE ACROSS

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:16.879 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:18.848 region:rollup2
BUT IN SOME COUNTIES THE

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:20.383 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS ARE SO SCARCE

01:10:18.848 --> 01:10:21.918 region:rollup2
AND THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.119 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD TIME FINDING A

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:28.991 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT LOCATION RETURN THERE

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:31.994 region:rollup2
THE CONTAINERS.

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:34.797 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN I HAVE RELEGATED SOME

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:36.532 region:rollup2
OF THESE OTHER ISSUES TO THIS

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:38.301 region:rollup2
SLIDE COMING VERY LATE IN MY

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:40.236 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION AND IT'S BECAUSE I

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:41.537 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAINTAIN THE FOCUS ON

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.839 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHICH

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:45.174 region:rollup2
IS THE RESTORATION.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:46.709 region:rollup2
I THE REDEMPTION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:10:45.174 --> 01:10:48.744 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMER CONVENIENCE

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:51.047 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT CAN BE DONE

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:52.815 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AT MODERNIZATION

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:54.851 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME.

01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:56.419 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO LOOK AT

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.620 region:rollup2
NEW WAYS OF COLLECTING

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:59.021 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.690 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN OTHER STATES THEY'RE

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:02.692 region:rollup2
FIFTY PROGRAMS.

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:04.160 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD THAT DO

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.561 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING SO

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.929 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF EXAMPLES A

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:08.865 region:rollup2
LOT OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:10.566 region:rollup2
RETURNING CONTAINERS. THAT WE

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:12.869 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK AT AND LEARN FROM THOSE

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:14.237 region:rollup2
AND CHOOSE MORE MODERN AND

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:18.074 region:rollup2
BETTER APPROACHES THAT WE HAVE

01:11:14.237 --> 01:11:19.142 region:rollup2
NOW. AS WE ALSO JUST REBUILD THE

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:20.643 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A VERY

01:11:19.142 --> 01:11:23.045 region:rollup2
CONVENTIONAL WAY.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:24.814 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO STILL THIS ISSUE

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:26.315 region:rollup2
OF REVENUE COLLECTION WE WROTE A

01:11:24.814 --> 01:11:26.816 region:rollup2
REPORT ABOUT THIS IN TWENTY

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:28.784 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND IT'S ON OUR

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:29.785 region:rollup2
WEBSITE.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.320 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT MORE AND MORE

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.922 region:rollup2
THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.758 region:rollup2
PER YEAR.

01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:36.726 region:rollup2
I'M STILL NEEDS TO BE COLLECTED

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:38.461 region:rollup2
FROM THE FREE RIDERS IN THE

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:41.030 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:42.231 region:rollup2
AND ACT CAL RECYCLE HIS HAS DONE

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.133 region:rollup2
A LOT OF WORK ON THIS OVER THE

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:46.269 region:rollup2
LAST FEW YEARS.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:48.004 region:rollup2
THEY ARE AT TAKING ON NEW

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:49.839 region:rollup2
MEASURES TO FIND THE

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:52.175 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS AND AND

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:53.876 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTORS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:55.645 region:rollup2
REGISTERED WITH THE SYSTEM.

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:57.280 region:rollup2
AND TEN CAN YOU BE A LOT MORE

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:59.649 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THAT TERM

01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:01.951 region:rollup2
FREE RIDERS MEANS WHOSE INCLUDED

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:03.986 region:rollup2
IN THAT GROUP. SURE AND FREE

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:05.655 region:rollup2
RIDERS WOULD BE EITHER. THAT

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:07.356 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:09.358 region:rollup2
WHO EITHER UNDER REPORT THEIR

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:10.493 region:rollup2
SALES OF BEVERAGES AND IN ORDER

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:13.296 region:rollup2
TO NOT PAY AS MUCH MONEY INTO

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:14.764 region:rollup2
THE FUND OR. THOSE THAT DON'T

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:15.865 region:rollup2
REGISTERED ALL AND DON'T PAY

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:17.133 region:rollup2
ANYTHING AT ALL.

01:12:15.865 --> 01:12:18.601 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THAT CAN HAPPEN

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:19.802 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE UNAWARE OF

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:21.337 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM AND THEY DON'T KNOW

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:22.305 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE YOU

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.073 region:rollup2
KNOW PAYING THEIR NICKELS AND

01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:25.474 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING BE REGISTERED WITH

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:27.210 region:rollup2
CALPERS CYCLES. THAT'S

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.611 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH NEW

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:30.012 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS.

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:31.214 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAL

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.748 region:rollup2
RECYCLE.

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:34.016 region:rollup2
AT COMMENTED ON IN ONE OF THEIR

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:34.951 region:rollup2
REPORTS IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.586 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE NEW CRAFT

01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:38.254 region:rollup2
BREWERS IN THE STATE.

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:39.455 region:rollup2
SO A LOT OF THE SMALL COMPANIES

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:40.823 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:42.892 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:44.827 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IT TAKES SOME OUTREACH.

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:46.596 region:rollup2
DOES THAT INCLUDE.

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:47.763 region:rollup2
A WINE BOTTLES.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:49.031 region:rollup2
NO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PART

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:51.133 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:53.669 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:55.304 region:rollup2
SO. CAL RECYCLE DID TAKE SOME

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:58.174 region:rollup2
STEPS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS TO

01:12:55.304 --> 01:13:00.409 region:rollup2
HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO AUDIT MORE.

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:02.144 region:rollup2
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN CAL

01:13:00.409 --> 01:13:04.146 region:rollup2
RECYCLE WAS DOING SIXTY AUDITS

01:13:02.144 --> 01:13:05.481 region:rollup2
PER YEAR THEN IT DROPPED DOWN TO

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:07.416 region:rollup2
AROUND THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE PER

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:08.618 region:rollup2
YEAR. OUT WITH THE ADDITION OF

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:12.054 region:rollup2
THESE NEW PEOPLE THEY WERE BACK

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:13.856 region:rollup2
UP TO SIXTY THIS LAST YEAR. AND

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:15.992 region:rollup2
THAT PAID OFF IN SPADES AND

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:17.226 region:rollup2
THERE WERE EIGHTEEN MILLION

01:13:15.992 --> 01:13:18.928 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND AUDIT FINDINGS.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:20.329 region:rollup2
IT IS THE ARE THE AUDITING

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:22.265 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS ONE THAT PAYS FOR

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:24.233 region:rollup2
ITSELF EVERY YEAR.

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:26.068 region:rollup2
AT A MINIMUM EVEN THOUGH THE LOW

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.603 region:rollup2
YEARS CAL RECYCLE GETS THREE

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:30.873 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:33.242 region:rollup2
SPEND IN AUDITING.

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:35.044 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALSO SERVICE AS MORE

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.612 region:rollup2
OF A DETERRENT AS IF PENALTIES

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:37.813 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY ASSESS

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:40.316 region:rollup2
I MEAN THERE IS ONE COMPANY THAT

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:42.351 region:rollup2
PAGE FOURTEEN AND A HALF MILLION

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:44.320 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. LAST YEAR.

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:48.090 region:rollup2
AND AUDIT FINDINGS BUT THEY

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:50.226 region:rollup2
WEREN'T ASSESSED ANY PENALTIES.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.861 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF IMPROVING FINANCIAL

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.129 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND FORECASTING I WILL

01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:55.364 region:rollup2
SAY THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:56.265 region:rollup2
YEARS IT HAS GOTTEN MUCH BETTER

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:59.635 region:rollup2
AND DIETS.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:14:02.705 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID.

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:04.373 region:rollup2
A GIVE CAL RECYCLE A CLEAN AUDIT

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:05.808 region:rollup2
ON THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:07.610 region:rollup2
FOR THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN.

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:10.646 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:12.181 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS AND THEIR AUDITS THEY

01:14:10.646 --> 01:14:13.015 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAD AUDITED%

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:15.184 region:rollup2
CAO RECYCLING FOUND THEIR

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:16.185 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:18.020 region:rollup2
MATERIALLY MISSTATED.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:19.055 region:rollup2
SO THERE WAS THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.890 region:rollup2
WORK TO BE DONE THERE BUT THEY

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:22.858 region:rollup2
HAVE RECEIVED NOW A CLEAN AUDIT

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:24.827 region:rollup2
AND I'M GLAD AND THAT THAT'S

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:26.729 region:rollup2
IMPROVING. AND THEN REDUCING

01:14:24.827 --> 01:14:28.531 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR CONTAMINATION THAT

01:14:26.729 --> 01:14:30.166 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE LOW HANGING FRUIT.

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:32.034 region:rollup2
CAL RECYCLE DID AN ASSESSMENT

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:33.369 region:rollup2
AND FOUND THAT TIME OF THE

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.270 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS THAT THEY MAKE TO THE

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:35.838 region:rollup2
CURBSIDE PROGRAM BECAUSE OF

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:36.672 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION THERE LITERALLY

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.441 region:rollup2
PAYING TEN MILLION DOLLARS A

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:40.343 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR TRASH.

01:14:38.441 --> 01:14:41.944 region:rollup2
IN THOSE PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:43.980 region:rollup2
BALES ARE DIRTY AND CONTAIN

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:44.780 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT PEACHY

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.415 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE P.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.751 region:rollup2
ET AND HDPE WHEN THEY'RE

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:49.151 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE AGE TO BE. AND IT

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:49.819 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE THAT'S.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.320 region:rollup2
.

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:53.456 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE EASIER PLACES WHERE

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.989 region:rollup2
THEY COULD A STRIVE TO IMPROVE

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:59.295 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL OUTCOMES THE

01:14:53.989 --> 01:15:01.864 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:03.966 region:rollup2
THIS SLIDE IS JUST AN EXAMPLE

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:04.200 region:rollup2
OF WHAT CONTAMINATION LOOKS LIKE

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:05.434 region:rollup2
THIS IS.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.636 region:rollup2
.

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:09.472 region:rollup2
A REAL FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA ON

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:11.040 region:rollup2
THE LEFT TO THOSE OR GLASS

01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:12.641 region:rollup2
DEPOSIT BOTTLES ON THE RIGHT

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.110 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE TRASH

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:15.778 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY GLASS FROM

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:17.980 region:rollup2
CURBSIDE PROGRAMS.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:20.082 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE PLASTIC AND PAPER

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.150 region:rollup2
HAS FLOATED TO THE TOP IN THAT

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:22.752 region:rollup2
PHOTOGRAPH.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:24.153 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A LOT OF CLASS IN

01:15:22.752 --> 01:15:25.621 region:rollup2
THERE THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEE.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:26.889 region:rollup2
BUT IT SORT OF SHOWS YOU THE

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:28.257 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES THAT THE PROCESSORS

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:30.159 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN ORDER TO

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:32.762 region:rollup2
CLEAN UP THAT PILE IN AND GET

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:33.829 region:rollup2
CLEAN GLASS OUT OF IT.

01:15:32.762 --> 01:15:35.197 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THING THAT'S VERY

01:15:33.829 --> 01:15:38.434 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ABOUT.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:42.371 region:rollup2
THE CAL RECYCLE PROGRAM IS THAT.

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:43.939 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE BIGGEST CURBSIDE

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.708 region:rollup2
RECYCLING FUNDING PROGRAM IN THE

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:47.576 region:rollup2
US.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:49.745 region:rollup2
MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:51.447 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS PAID

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:53.582 region:rollup2
TO THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS.

01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:55.818 region:rollup2
AND ON A REVENUE PER CONTAINER

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:57.319 region:rollup2
BASIS.

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:58.220 region:rollup2
THE CURBSIDE PROGRAMS ARE

01:15:57.319 --> 01:16:00.990 region:rollup2
RECEIVING.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.458 region:rollup2
AT AS OF THE.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.726 region:rollup2
THE DATE OF THESE IT WOULD BE

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:06.028 region:rollup2
LOWER NOW BECAUSE THE SCRAP

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:06.796 region:rollup2
VALUES A LOWER BUT IT WAS MORE

01:16:06.028 --> 01:16:08.597 region:rollup2
THAN TEN CENTS PER CONTAINER.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:10.1000 region:rollup2
.

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:11.567 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO OTHER DEPOSIT PROGRAM

01:16:10.1000 --> 01:16:15.371 region:rollup2
THAT USES ITS RESOURCES THIS

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:17.173 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.741 region:rollup2
NOW LOOKING TO THE FUTURE.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:19.975 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ALSO MENTIONED WHEN SHE

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:21.210 region:rollup2
WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT WHAT WE

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:22.645 region:rollup2
COULD DO TO GET CLOSER TO A

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:24.847 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT.

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:26.615 region:rollup2
OREGON HAS RECENTLY INCREASED

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:29.185 region:rollup2
THEIR DEPOSIT FROM FIVE CENTS TO

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:31.087 region:rollup2
TEN CENTS AND NOT HAS LED TO A

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:32.555 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL RESULT. THEY USE TO

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.055 region:rollup2
HAVE A REDEMPTION RATE JUST A

01:16:32.555 --> 01:16:35.124 region:rollup2
YEAR AGO THAT SIXTY FOUR

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:36.625 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:38.394 region:rollup2
AND WEDNESDAY INCREASE THE

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:39.962 region:rollup2
DEPOSIT VALUE TO TEN CENTS.

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:41.530 region:rollup2
NOW THEY'VE GONE OVER EIGHTY

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:43.165 region:rollup2
PERCENT THEIR EIGHTY TWO PERCENT

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:44.433 region:rollup2
SO ASSERTIVE OVERNIGHT THEY

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.401 region:rollup2
FLIPPED A SWITCH AND THEY WENT

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.169 region:rollup2
FROM SIXTY FOUR PERCENT TO

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:48.237 region:rollup2
EIGHTY TWO PERCENT.

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:49.238 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ALSO EXPANDED THEIR

01:16:48.237 --> 01:16:50.840 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO INCLUDE MORE

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:52.608 region:rollup2
CONTAINER TYPES.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:54.009 region:rollup2
AND OREGON.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.411 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS MORE REDEMPTION

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:57.413 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS

01:16:55.411 --> 01:16:58.647 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH

01:16:57.413 --> 01:17:00.282 region:rollup2
THERE POPULATION IS ABOUT THE

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:02.384 region:rollup2
TENTH OF OURS.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:04.220 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALL OF THE STORES TAKE

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:05.955 region:rollup2
BACK CONTAINERS.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.989 region:rollup2
A QUESTION YEAR IN TERMS OF

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:08.157 region:rollup2
CONTAINER TYPE YOU MENTIONED

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:08.858 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'VE INCREASED THE A

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:10.426 region:rollup2
CONTAINER TYPES.

01:17:08.858 --> 01:17:12.328 region:rollup2
OF.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:14.330 region:rollup2
THAT'S I ASSUME WITHIN ORGAN

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:15.231 region:rollup2
THEY SHIFTED THE NUMBER OF

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:18.000 region:rollup2
CONTAINER TYPES HOW DOES THAT

01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:19.034 region:rollup2
COMPARE TO CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.569 region:rollup2
THEY'VE NOW CAUGHT UP WITH

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:22.972 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:24.974 region:rollup2
THEY WERE NOT ARE ALREADY.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.574 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ARE NOW?

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:27.343 region:rollup2
IN TERMS A CONTAINER TYPES YES

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:29.778 region:rollup2
YES.

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:31.614 region:rollup2
THEY THEY DO NOT ACCEPT WINE AND

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:33.282 region:rollup2
SPIRITS IN THEIR PROGRAM OR MILK

01:17:31.614 --> 01:17:34.283 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE CALIFORNIA.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.985 region:rollup2
THEY.

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:37.286 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY BUT ANOTHER

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:39.522 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT LESSON FROM.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:40.523 region:rollup2
OREGON IS THAT THEY WENT

01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:42.825 region:rollup2
THROUGH THEIR EXPANSION AND

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:44.260 region:rollup2
MODERNIZATION PROCESS IN STAGES

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:46.262 region:rollup2
SO TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING AT

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.596 region:rollup2
ONCE MEANS SORT OF TOO MUCH

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:49.999 region:rollup2
CHANGE AT ONE TIME.

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:51.200 region:rollup2
THEY FIRST EXPANDED TO WATER

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:52.635 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE ONLY COVERING

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.303 region:rollup2
CARBONATED BEVERAGES NOW THAT'S

01:17:52.635 --> 01:17:55.738 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALIFORNIA DID LIKE

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.373 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO THEY

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:59.808 region:rollup2
EXPANDED TO WATER. THEN THEY

01:17:57.373 --> 01:18:01.243 region:rollup2
WENT FOR FIVE CENTS TO TEN CENTS

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:02.678 region:rollup2
AND THEN EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THAT

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.647 region:rollup2
THEY WENT TO.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:06.348 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE OTHER NON CARBONATED

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:08.284 region:rollup2
BEVERAGES LIKE TEA AND SPORTS

01:18:06.348 --> 01:18:08.884 region:rollup2
DRINKS AND ENERGY DRINKS THE

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:09.818 region:rollup2
ONES THAT WE ALREADY COVER IN

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:11.353 region:rollup2
OUR PROGRAM.

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:12.321 region:rollup2
SO TERMS A CONTAINER TYPES AND

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:13.622 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE TYPES THEY CAUGHT UP

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:17.059 region:rollup2
WITH US.

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:19.595 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF THIS STYLE OF

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:22.064 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION THEIR MODERNIZATION

01:18:19.595 --> 01:18:24.800 region:rollup2
IS A GENERATION AHEAD OF US.

01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:26.569 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT BOTTLE DROP RETURN

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.405 region:rollup2
CENTERS WHICH ARE INCREDIBLY

01:18:26.569 --> 01:18:31.073 region:rollup2
NICE AND. REDEMPTION CENTERS

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:32.741 region:rollup2
WITH THREE DIFFERENT STYLES OF

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:35.010 region:rollup2
RETURN YOU CAN BAG UP YOUR

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:36.278 region:rollup2
MATERIALS AND THAT IN A BAG WITH

YOUR OWN TWIST TIE WITH YOUR OWN

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:39.215 region:rollup2
BAR CODE AND JUST DROP IT

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:40.883 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SLOT. THEY'RE

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:43.118 region:rollup2
INTRODUCING THESE BOTTLE DROP

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:45.554 region:rollup2
EXPRESSED SITES AT GROCERY

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:47.056 region:rollup2
STORES SITTER AGAIN EXPANDING

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.891 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF SITES WHERE PEOPLE

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:50.192 region:rollup2
CAN RETURN COULD CONTAINERS AND

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:51.794 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:53.796 region:rollup2
THE EASE WITH WHICH PEOPLE CAN

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:55.464 region:rollup2
RETURN CONTAINERS. NO WAITING IN

01:18:53.796 --> 01:18:58.033 region:rollup2
LINE AT ALL IF YOU HAVE YOUR

CODE ON YOUR BACK.

01:18:59.268 --> 01:19:02.871 region:rollup2
YOU JUST OPEN THOSE SLOT THAT'S

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:04.940 region:rollup2
LIKE A MAILBOX AND DROP YOUR

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:06.375 region:rollup2
YOUR BAG OF MATERIALS IN AND

THEY LOVE THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:40.476 region:rollup2
THE LARGE VOLUME RETURNS OUT OF

THE GROCERY STORES AND INTO

THESE BOTTLE DROP REDEMPTION

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:45.514 region:rollup2
CENTERS. AND THEY LOVE THAT

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:47.650 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GETTING THE FOOT TRAFFIC

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:49.184 region:rollup2
AND THE DOLLARS INTO THE STORE

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:51.387 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GET PEOPLE DROPPING

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:53.055 region:rollup2

KIOSK TO GET THERE. REDEMPTION

01:19:56.358 --> 01:20:00.329 region:rollup2
VALUE AND THEN SPENDING THAT IN

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:01.130 region:rollup2
THE STORE.

01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:02.798 region:rollup2

THANK YOU YES.

01:20:08.437 --> 01:20:13.342 region:rollup2
WITH THIS PERHAPS.

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:16.178 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:18.447 region:rollup2
MIRROR OREGON'S?

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:20.315 region:rollup2
PROCESS PERFORMANCE AND

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:22.618 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION MADE IT SOUNDS TO

01:20:20.315 --> 01:20:24.620 region:rollup2
ME LIKE OREGON HAS.

01:20:22.618 --> 01:20:26.255 region:rollup2
BUT A PRETTY GOOD JOB IT IS IT'S

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.856 region:rollup2
SO DIFFERENT FROM OURS THAT WE

01:20:26.255 --> 01:20:30.793 region:rollup2
NEED TO RETOOL LARS.

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:32.995 region:rollup2
BOTH WITH RESPECT TO POLICY AND.

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:34.963 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:37.099 region:rollup2
HOW FAR ARE YOU APART AND CAN WE

01:20:34.963 --> 01:20:39.268 region:rollup2
GET CLOSER TO WHAT THEY DO SURE

01:20:37.099 --> 01:20:41.136 region:rollup2
WELL IT CAN BE DONE SO OR IT'S

01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:43.272 region:rollup2
NOT JUST ORGAN THAT HAS THIS

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:45.307 region:rollup2
TYPE OF A DROP SYSTEM? AND THEY

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:46.909 region:rollup2
ALSO M. IMPLEMENTED SOME OF

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:49.611 region:rollup2
THESE CONCEPTS FIRST IN MAINE

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:50.546 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS AGO

01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:52.281 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE COMPANY CALLED

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:53.816 region:rollup2
CLINK THAT OPERATES THE PROGRAM

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:56.185 region:rollup2
IN MAINE ALSO EXPANDED THEIR

01:20:53.816 --> 01:20:57.286 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS INTO NEW YORK.

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:59.288 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

01:20:57.286 --> 01:21:00.856 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS THAT WORK ON

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:03.525 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM IN OREGON.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.927 region:rollup2
IN ALL OF THOSE CASES THEY DID

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:07.396 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE TWEAKS TO THEIR

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:09.798 region:rollup2
LAWS TO ALLOW THESE NEW SYSTEMS

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:13.569 region:rollup2
TO OPERATE. TIME BUT IT WASN'T

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:13.969 region:rollup2
IN NO INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEMS TO

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:15.537 region:rollup2
GET THROUGH THAT.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:17.506 region:rollup2
AND.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:19.708 region:rollup2
IN ALL OF THOSE CASES THERE'S A

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:20.976 region:rollup2
STABLE RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:22.644 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH MONEY FOR

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:24.179 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS TO OPERATE.

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:26.181 region:rollup2
THAT'S A KEY THING THAT WE DON'T

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:27.850 region:rollup2
HAVE HERE THOSE COMPANIES THAT

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.918 region:rollup2
OPERATE THOSE PROGRAMS DON'T

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:33.222 region:rollup2
WANT TO OPERATE. IN THE

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:35.157 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY VOLATILE FUNDING AT

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.258 region:rollup2
CLIMATE THAT WE HAVE HERE. A CAN

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:39.161 region:rollup2
YOU IDENTIFY THOSE STREAMS

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:39.661 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND SPECIAL TAX BUT

01:21:39.161 --> 01:21:40.662 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BUT IT WHAT'S THE

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.230 region:rollup2
UNIQUENESS OF THE STRAIN THE

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:44.199 region:rollup2
UNIQUENESS OF OUR STREAM IS

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:46.201 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:21:44.199 --> 01:21:48.337 region:rollup2
THAT TO PAYMENTS THAT I DESCRIBE

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:50.506 region:rollup2
THAT REDEMPTION CENTERS GATT.

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:52.474 region:rollup2
ARE BOTH VOLATILE.

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:54.810 region:rollup2
IT IN ALL OF THE OTHER PLACES

01:21:52.474 --> 01:21:57.079 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A DOLLAR AMOUNT PER

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:57.780 region:rollup2
CONTAINER SO WHEN YOU WHAT AS I

01:21:57.079 --> 01:21:59.581 region:rollup2
WOULD IF THEY HAD IS OREGON DO.

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.816 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS DIFFERENT WITH

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:02.651 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO PAY.

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:03.886 region:rollup2
SURE EARLIER WITHOUT REDUCING

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.453 region:rollup2
THE VOLATILITY IN GETTING THAT

01:22:03.886 --> 01:22:05.554 region:rollup2
JUST WHAT WHERE DOES IT COME

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:06.688 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:07.923 region:rollup2
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:09.324 region:rollup2
OUR DESCRIBE OTH NEW YORK AND

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:10.626 region:rollup2
OREGON AND I AND I JUST WANNA BE

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.660 region:rollup2
COMPLETE AND MY ANSWER TO YOU

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:12.928 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY BOTH WORK BUT THE

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:16.498 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFERENT.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:18.367 region:rollup2
SO IN NEW YORK AND MAINE THE

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:20.068 region:rollup2
HANDLING FEE IS A CERTAIN NUMBER

01:22:18.367 --> 01:22:21.603 region:rollup2
OF CENTS PER CONTAINER. SO THAT

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:22.571 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE COMPANY CAN COME IN

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:23.806 region:rollup2
AND THEY KNOW IN ADVANCE I'M

01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:25.140 region:rollup2
GONNA GET THREE AND A HALF CENTS

01:22:23.806 --> 01:22:27.543 region:rollup2
PER CONTAINER ON EVERY CONTAINER

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.844 region:rollup2
I HANDLE. THE FUNDING SOURCE IS

01:22:27.543 --> 01:22:31.280 region:rollup2
COMING FROM THE BEVERAGE

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:32.748 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTORS DIRECTLY THAT'S

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.584 region:rollup2
THAT THE NEW YORK AND.

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:37.619 region:rollup2
A MAIN PROGRAMS ARE.

01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:38.454 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:39.988 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:42.057 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM SO EVERY

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:43.525 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATE IS

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:44.993 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:46.829 region:rollup2
HANDLING FEES TO THE REDEMPTION

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:49.431 region:rollup2
CENTERS.

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:50.666 region:rollup2
THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM OREGON

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.667 region:rollup2
WHICH ORGAN MUCH MORE LIKE

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:53.535 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS A CENTRALIZED

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:55.370 region:rollup2
FUND.

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:56.405 region:rollup2
AND THE CENTRALIZED FUND RUNS

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:58.707 region:rollup2
THESE REDEMPTION CENTERS

01:22:56.405 --> 01:22:59.741 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY IT IS A COOPERATIVE

01:22:58.707 --> 01:23:02.778 region:rollup2
CALLED THE OREGON BEVERAGE

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:05.948 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING COOPERATIVE.

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:07.416 region:rollup2
AND OB R. C. AND THEY STAFF THE

01:23:05.948 --> 01:23:09.952 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS THEY CITE THE

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:10.419 region:rollup2
REDEMPTION CENTERS THEY OWN THEM

01:23:09.952 --> 01:23:12.888 region:rollup2
THEY.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:14.223 region:rollup2
THEY SEND THE TRUCKS AROUND TO

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:15.991 region:rollup2
PICK UP ALL OF THE MATERIAL SO

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:17.893 region:rollup2
REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.760 region:rollup2
ASPECT OF IT IS REALLY DIFFERENT

01:23:17.893 --> 01:23:20.529 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.664 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:24.633 region:rollup2
IT IS POSSIBLE TO LAYER

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:26.335 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON TOP OF

01:23:24.633 --> 01:23:28.737 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:30.739 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS WE HAVE STABILITY IN

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:31.373 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND SUFFICIENT FUNDING

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:37.446 region:rollup2
CHURCH TO RUN AN OPERATION LIKE

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:40.215 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:23:37.446 --> 01:23:42.317 region:rollup2
START WRAPPING UP HERE.

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:44.419 region:rollup2
MY LAST COUPLE OF SLIDES.

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.921 region:rollup2
I TOO WANTED TO BRING UP THIS

01:23:44.419 --> 01:23:48.790 region:rollup2
MARINE DEBRIS ISSUE.

01:23:45.921 --> 01:23:50.859 region:rollup2
THERE WHO MOST RECENT RESEARCH

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.661 region:rollup2
IS NOW TELLING US THAT WE HAVE.

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:54.463 region:rollup2
EIGHT TIMES

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:56.365 region:rollup2
OF PLASTIC AND HEARING THE OCEAN

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:58.100 region:rollup2
EVERY SECOND.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:24:00.502 region:rollup2
AND THIS WHALE WAS CONSTRUCTED

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:01.937 region:rollup2
BY AN ARTIST TO ILLUSTRATE THAT

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:04.172 region:rollup2
SO IT THAT'S EIGHT TONS OF

01:24:01.937 --> 01:24:06.108 region:rollup2
PLASTIC THE AMOUNT THAT GOES

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:07.743 region:rollup2
INTO THE OCEAN EVERY SECOND.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:10.779 region:rollup2
AND THE OCEANS PROVIDE HALF OF

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:12.514 region:rollup2
THE OXYGEN WE BREATHE SO.

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:13.715 region:rollup2
THIS REALLY HEAR HIS.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.650 region:rollup2
THAT THE HEALTH OF THE OCEANS

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:16.251 region:rollup2
REALLY IS A LIFE OR DEATH

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:19.054 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:24:16.251 --> 01:24:20.289 region:rollup2
LASTLY AND THIS IS AN ART

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:22.391 region:rollup2
PROJECT WE DID LAST

01:24:20.289 --> 01:24:23.926 region:rollup2
SUMMER ON THE BEACH BECAUSE WE

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:25.727 region:rollup2
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THE ISSUE OF

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:27.162 region:rollup2
MARINE DEBRIS AND THE IMPORTANCE

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:29.064 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROGRAM.

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:31.099 region:rollup2
TO REDUCING LETTER.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:33.602 region:rollup2
IT'S CRITICAL IN REDUCING

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:34.903 region:rollup2
LETTER AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE

01:24:33.602 --> 01:24:35.304 region:rollup2
AT REDUCING BEVERAGE CONTAINER

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.072 region:rollup2
LATER.

01:24:35.304 --> 01:24:38.774 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:40.375 region:rollup2
ART PROJECT IS EIGHT HUNDRED

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:41.843 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO CONTAINERS THAT'S THE

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:44.846 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THAT EVERY PERSON IN THE

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:46.048 region:rollup2
US CONSUMES EVERY YEAR. AND IT'S

01:24:44.846 --> 01:24:47.516 region:rollup2
IN JUST THE RIGHT MIX OF ALL THE

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:49.952 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BEVERAGES LIKE SODA

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:51.353 region:rollup2
AND WATER AND BEER AND WINE AND

01:24:49.952 --> 01:24:53.455 region:rollup2
IT'S IN JUST THE RIGHT MIX OF

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:55.123 region:rollup2
GLASS BOTTLES VERSUS PLASTIC

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:57.192 region:rollup2
PURSES ALUMINUM CANS WE'VE EVEN

01:24:55.123 --> 01:24:58.493 region:rollup2
GOT SOME POUCHES THEREIN SOME

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.928 region:rollup2
GABLE TOP CONTAINERS.

01:24:58.493 --> 01:25:01.296 region:rollup2
I AM BUT IT'S MEANT TO PROVIDE.

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:03.031 region:rollup2
.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:04.1000 region:rollup2
UP A LITTLE BIT OF CHEER AND

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:07.602 region:rollup2
HOPEFULNESS AND IN OTHER WAYS

01:25:04.1000 --> 01:25:09.404 region:rollup2
SORT OF GLOOMY PRESENTATION.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:10.706 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM CAN'T BE THAT HARD

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:12.774 region:rollup2
TO FIX

01:25:10.706 --> 01:25:14.576 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FIFTY OTHER EXAMPLES

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:16.011 region:rollup2
AROUND THE WORLD OF BEST

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:16.578 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT WE CAN DRAW UPON

01:25:16.011 --> 01:25:19.081 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS.

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:22.017 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:22.751 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THAT OPTIMISM.

01:25:22.017 --> 01:25:24.119 region:rollup2
AND.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:28.557 region:rollup2
LET'S MOVE ON TO MR MURRAY'S

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:30.092 region:rollup2
PRESENTE.

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:31.093 region:rollup2
MORNINGS CHAIR MEMBERS MARK

01:25:30.092 --> 01:25:31.627 region:rollup2
MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:33.161 region:rollup2
GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:35.063 region:rollup2
WASTE.

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:36.632 region:rollup2
I HAVE OF THIS IS I'VE BEEN

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:38.200 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THIS BEVERAGE

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:39.735 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.269 region:rollup2
ALMOST FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

01:25:39.735 --> 01:25:43.238 region:rollup2
THREE DECADES OF.

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:46.074 region:rollup2
RECYCLING. AND.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:46.441 region:rollup2
I WANT TO START OFF BY BUT

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:47.509 region:rollup2
REALLY THINKING.

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.877 region:rollup2
.

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:50.345 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRMAN THIS COMMITTEE

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:52.247 region:rollup2
FATHER CHAIRMAN OF THE BUDGET

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:53.782 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THE STAFF UP FOR THE

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:55.317 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OF TIME AND

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:56.318 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFULNESS NOT JUST TODAY

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:58.987 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY OVER THE LAST TWENTY

01:25:56.318 --> 01:26:00.589 region:rollup2
FOUR MONTHS. IN TRYING TO FIX

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:02.457 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BEVERAGE

01:26:00.589 --> 01:26:04.092 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. ON

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:05.694 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY I WANNA TALK A LITTLE

01:26:04.092 --> 01:26:06.995 region:rollup2
BIT ABOUT PUTTING OUT THE FIRE

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:08.363 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO ONE TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.264 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE REDECORATING THAT I

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:10.432 region:rollup2
THINK HAS TO.

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:13.368 region:rollup2
TAKE PLACE.

01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:15.470 region:rollup2
BOB I THINK THAT THE PUTTING OUT

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:17.072 region:rollup2
THE FIRE SOLUTION THAT THIS

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:19.608 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS PUT FORWARD FOR

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:21.076 region:rollup2
THE LAST TWO YEARS. REMAINS

01:26:19.608 --> 01:26:24.813 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE RIGHT SOLUTION.

01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:27.315 region:rollup2
THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT.

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:29.651 region:rollup2
AS AS TWO HUNDRED DESCRIBED WE

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:32.154 region:rollup2
FACED REALLY A PERFECT STORM

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:33.355 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT WAS A RESULT OF.

01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:36.291 region:rollup2
.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:38.126 region:rollup2
GLOBAL DECLINE IN SCRAP PRICES.

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:39.695 region:rollup2
BUT THIS PROGRAM WAS SUPPOSE TO

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:42.364 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO TO RESPOND

01:26:39.695 --> 01:26:44.299 region:rollup2
DROPS IN SCRAP PRICES BY HAVING.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:45.901 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES COVER THAT

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:48.904 region:rollup2
NET COST RECYCLING.

01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:50.539 region:rollup2
ON AND UNFORTUNATELY THE THAT

01:26:48.904 --> 01:26:52.240 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:54.009 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:56.044 region:rollup2
STATUTORY PROVISIONS.

01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:56.878 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND AS

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.579 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AS WE NEED AND SO THE

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:59.247 region:rollup2
GAP THAT.

01:26:57.579 --> 01:27:01.283 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:03.518 region:rollup2
OF THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:05.520 region:rollup2
SCRAP PRICE THAT THE PROGRAM

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:06.755 region:rollup2
SOON FOLKS WERE GETTING WAS

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.023 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN THE SCRAP PRICE

01:27:06.755 --> 01:27:09.958 region:rollup2
THAT RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:12.260 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY GETTING.

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:14.229 region:rollup2
AND THUS THE INFRASTRUCTURE LOST

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:15.097 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT IS ENDED UP BEING

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.498 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:27:15.097 --> 01:27:18.233 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:20.702 region:rollup2
SCRAP INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:22.337 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AS

01:27:20.702 --> 01:27:24.005 region:rollup2
RECENTLY AS TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:26.208 region:rollup2
WAS REALIZING THREE HUNDRED

01:27:24.005 --> 01:27:27.042 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF SCRAP

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.876 region:rollup2
VALUE FOR RECYCLING BEVERAGE

01:27:27.042 --> 01:27:29.878 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS.

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:31.813 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:33.181 region:rollup2
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS LOST

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:35.117 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:37.519 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:27:35.117 --> 01:27:39.254 region:rollup2
SO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF

01:27:37.519 --> 01:27:40.622 region:rollup2
MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN REMOVED

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.624 region:rollup2
FROM THE SYSTEM.

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:43.425 region:rollup2
AND WHILE WE DO HAVE THIS

01:27:42.624 --> 01:27:45.293 region:rollup2
PROCESSING PAYMENT THIS THIS

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:46.762 region:rollup2
PROMISED

01:27:45.293 --> 01:27:48.964 region:rollup2
TO THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:51.399 region:rollup2
TO COVER THE NET COST RECYCLING

01:27:48.964 --> 01:27:51.900 region:rollup2
IT IS BEEN SLOW TO COVER THAT

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:54.202 region:rollup2
FULL COST OF RECYCLING.

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:56.338 region:rollup2
SO.

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:57.706 region:rollup2
SLOW TO RESPOND IN IN THE CHANGE

01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:59.941 region:rollup2
IN SCRAP VALUE.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:28:02.644 region:rollup2
SECONDLY AGAIN THE NINETEEN

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:04.012 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SIX STATUTORY PROVISIONS.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:05.480 region:rollup2
DECIDED THAT TO IN ORDER TO

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:06.848 region:rollup2
COVER THE.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.583 region:rollup2
AVERAGE COST OF RECYCLING.

01:28:06.848 --> 01:28:10.285 region:rollup2
THAT

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:12.521 region:rollup2
CALLOUSLY BILL WOULD GO OUT AND

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:14.523 region:rollup2
SURVEY ON IN THE BIG THEY HAD

01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:15.590 region:rollup2
GIVE THEMSELVES TWO YEARS

01:28:14.523 --> 01:28:16.458 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A TWO YEAR TIMEFRAME.

01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:18.026 region:rollup2
ON

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:20.128 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION TO GO

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:20.729 region:rollup2
BACK AND SURVEY COSTS.

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.596 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY SERVING

01:28:20.729 --> 01:28:22.664 region:rollup2
COSTS

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:24.599 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR SERVING.

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:26.268 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:27.903 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE

01:28:26.268 --> 01:28:29.938 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:28:27.903 --> 01:28:31.473 region:rollup2
RECEIVING LESS MONEY IN THE FORM

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:33.074 region:rollup2
OF SCRAP VALUE. THEIR

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:34.776 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES GO DOWN.

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:36.845 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:38.780 region:rollup2
SCRAP VALUE THAT THE COSTA

01:28:36.845 --> 01:28:40.215 region:rollup2
RECYCLING SURVEY IS THAT WE'RE

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.416 region:rollup2
WE'RE KIND OF IN THIS DEATH

01:28:40.215 --> 01:28:42.918 region:rollup2
SPIRAL BECAUSE.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:44.653 region:rollup2
THE REVENUE WAS GONE DOWN

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:46.388 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE RESPONSE TO THAT

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:47.856 region:rollup2
LOST REVENUE BY REDUCING THEIR

01:28:46.388 --> 01:28:48.924 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES SO THEN THE NEXT

01:28:47.856 --> 01:28:50.525 region:rollup2
COST SURVEY.

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:51.893 region:rollup2
PEERS

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:53.862 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT THE RECYCLING

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:56.264 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS LESS.

01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:57.365 region:rollup2
AND SO THE PROBLEM THAT BEGAN IN

01:28:56.264 --> 01:28:59.501 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY

01:28:57.365 --> 01:29:01.203 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND

01:28:59.501 --> 01:29:03.672 region:rollup2
WORSE AND WORSE BECAUSE WE'RE NO

01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:05.340 region:rollup2
LONGER REIMBURSING RECYCLERS

01:29:03.672 --> 01:29:06.508 region:rollup2
WITH THE THE COST OF RECYCLING

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.410 region:rollup2
WERE NOT COVERING THAT COST

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:11.112 region:rollup2
RECYCLING. THAT WE WERE BACK IN

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:11.913 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN.

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:13.448 region:rollup2
THE THIRD COMPLAINT OF THE

01:29:11.913 --> 01:29:16.551 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BOB.

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:19.221 region:rollup2
NOT STATUTORY REGULATORY ARM IN

01:29:16.551 --> 01:29:21.690 region:rollup2
ANY STATE PROGRAM WHERE WE ASK

01:29:19.221 --> 01:29:23.358 region:rollup2
THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO UP PROVIDE

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.693 region:rollup2
A SERVICE TO COVER UP PUBLIC

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:25.560 region:rollup2
COST.

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:27.095 region:rollup2
WE PROVIDE A REASONABLE

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.598 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RETURNS.

01:29:27.095 --> 01:29:30.365 region:rollup2
AND THE STATUTE WAS SILENT IN

01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:33.068 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE MECHANISM FOR DOING

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:34.269 region:rollup2
THAT NOW. MANY STATE PROGRAMS

01:29:33.068 --> 01:29:35.837 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S FOR HEALTH CARE.

01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:37.272 region:rollup2
OR FOR CONSTRUCTION WE PUT OF

01:29:35.837 --> 01:29:38.940 region:rollup2
FIXED.

01:29:37.272 --> 01:29:40.542 region:rollup2
REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:41.943 region:rollup2
USUALLY IN THE TEN TO FOURTEEN

01:29:40.542 --> 01:29:42.577 region:rollup2
PERCENT RANGE FOR THE PRIVATE

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.912 region:rollup2
SECTOR WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING

01:29:42.577 --> 01:29:45.580 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:29:43.912 --> 01:29:47.616 region:rollup2
CALPERS CYCLE IN AGAIN THEIR

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.651 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH THEM

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:51.152 region:rollup2
ARM CAME UP WITH THE A

01:29:49.651 --> 01:29:53.154 region:rollup2
REGULATORY FORMULA THAT SAID

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:56.358 region:rollup2
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:58.093 region:rollup2
RECYCLING SECTOR NATIONALLY. IS

01:29:56.358 --> 01:29:59.427 region:rollup2
REPORTING ON THEIR TAXES.

01:29:58.093 --> 01:30:01.062 region:rollup2
DETERMINE WHAT THEIR PROFIT WAS

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:02.831 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GONNA CALL THAT THE

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:04.966 region:rollup2
REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS.

01:30:02.831 --> 01:30:05.767 region:rollup2
BOB AND IT ENDS UP THAT LIKE

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:07.168 region:rollup2
EVERY OTHER BUSINESS IN THE

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:09.571 region:rollup2
ECONOMY THE.

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:10.105 region:rollup2
RECYCLING SECTOR TENDS TO

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:13.074 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:30:10.105 --> 01:30:15.176 region:rollup2
SHOW A LOT OF EXPENSES AND KIND

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:15.777 region:rollup2
OF LOW BALL THEIR PROFIT MARGINS

01:30:15.176 --> 01:30:18.146 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE SUBMITTING THEIR

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:19.781 region:rollup2
TAXES AND A RESULT AS A RESULT

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:22.417 region:rollup2
THAT REASONABLE FINANCE RETURN

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:24.653 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU RELY ON THAT. THAT TAX

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:25.186 region:rollup2
DATA SHOWS AN EXTRAORDINARILY

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:27.422 region:rollup2
SMALL IN THE IN THE TWO TO

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:30.091 region:rollup2
THREE.

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:30.592 region:rollup2
PERCENT RANGE AND AS WE SAW AT

01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:33.461 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:35.196 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. AN ACTUAL NEGATIVE IN

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:36.598 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE RECENT IN IN TERMS

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:38.266 region:rollup2
OF THE PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:40.201 region:rollup2
RECYCLING SECTOR NOW HAVE

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:41.703 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT. THAT.

01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:42.304 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY

01:30:41.703 --> 01:30:44.005 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THE RECYCLING CENTER

01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:46.107 region:rollup2
STE

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:48.143 region:rollup2
SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES LOST

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:49.844 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND THAT WAS THEN.

01:30:48.143 --> 01:30:52.280 region:rollup2
BY REGULATION THAT HAD TO BE

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:52.881 region:rollup2
REFLECTED IN THE REIMBURSEMENT

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.249 region:rollup2
LEVELS FOR THE COST RECYCLING

01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:56.318 region:rollup2
SO.

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:58.853 region:rollup2
IN A NUTSHELL THREE PROBLEMS TO

01:30:56.318 --> 01:31:00.255 region:rollup2
STATUTORY AND ONE REGULATORY

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:01.923 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:31:00.255 --> 01:31:03.591 region:rollup2
THE STATUTORY PROBLEM FOR TWENTY

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:04.759 region:rollup2
FOUR MONTHS NOW. AND AGAIN THIS

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:05.760 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS DONE A FABULOUS

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:07.762 region:rollup2
JOB OF OFFERING A SOLUTION TO

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.396 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:10.532 region:rollup2
THE REGULATORY PROCESS WE HAVE

01:31:08.396 --> 01:31:12.267 region:rollup2
INSULTED.

01:31:10.532 --> 01:31:14.436 region:rollup2
ON THE REGULATORY PROBLEM.

01:31:12.267 --> 01:31:16.938 region:rollup2
WAS IDENTIFIED BY CAL RECYCLE BY

01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:18.540 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TWELVE MONTHS AGO.

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:20.375 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT TWELVE MONTHS CAL

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:21.176 region:rollup2
RECYCLE HAD THE AUTHORITY AND

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:22.844 region:rollup2
THE FLEXIBILITY TO SOLVE THAT

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:25.747 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:27.349 region:rollup2
SO. IN THE ONE INSTANCE WHEN CAL

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:28.817 region:rollup2
RECYCLE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:30.118 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:31.386 region:rollup2
THEY SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE

01:31:30.118 --> 01:31:33.355 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND FRANKLY IN THEIR

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:34.789 region:rollup2
CREATIVITY TO ADDRESS THE

01:31:33.355 --> 01:31:36.925 region:rollup2
PROBLEM ON REASONABLE FINANCE

01:31:34.789 --> 01:31:39.227 region:rollup2
RETURN BY PUTTING A FIXED

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:40.795 region:rollup2
NUMBER IN THEIR REPLACING THE

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:42.197 region:rollup2
OLD OUTDATED REGULATION. THEY

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:44.165 region:rollup2
ALSO TOOK A STEP

01:31:42.197 --> 01:31:45.834 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OUR ADDRESSING

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:48.169 region:rollup2
ANOTHER COMPONENT A CRISIS WHICH

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:50.238 region:rollup2
WAS THE LOSS OF OF RURAL

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:52.207 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. BY

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:53.575 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING A HIGHER REASONABLE

01:31:52.207 --> 01:31:56.344 region:rollup2
FINANCE RETURN.

01:31:53.575 --> 01:31:57.612 region:rollup2
IN FOR THE UP RULE RECYCLING

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:59.180 region:rollup2
CENTERS.

01:31:57.612 --> 01:32:01.116 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW AGAIN WE'VE BEEN

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.917 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS OF

01:32:01.116 --> 01:32:04.786 region:rollup2
OF THE LOS OF OF REVENUE TO THE

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:06.921 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE THE

01:32:04.786 --> 01:32:08.490 region:rollup2
LOSS OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:32:06.921 --> 01:32:10.392 region:rollup2
TERMS OF REDUCED RECYCLING

01:32:08.490 --> 01:32:12.694 region:rollup2
CENTERS NOW FOR TWO YEARS. AND I

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:14.629 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SAY THAT IN THE ONE

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:15.663 region:rollup2
INSTANCE WHERE CAL RECYCLES HAD

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:16.965 region:rollup2
THE AUTHORITY TO DO SOMETHING

01:32:15.663 --> 01:32:17.832 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:19.401 region:rollup2
WE CAME UP WITH A SUCCESSFUL

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:20.702 region:rollup2
SOLUTION WHICH IS.

01:32:19.401 --> 01:32:22.470 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DOES MOTIVATE ME TO

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:24.172 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:26.808 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN NECESSARILY TRYING

01:32:24.172 --> 01:32:28.443 region:rollup2
TO CONSTANTLY BE SCRAMBLING TO

01:32:26.808 --> 01:32:30.345 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH LEGISLATION.

01:32:28.443 --> 01:32:32.514 region:rollup2
FIX THE PROBLEM AS THIS

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:34.482 region:rollup2
CYCLING. INFRASTRUCTURE IN

01:32:32.514 --> 01:32:35.850 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EVOLVES OVER THE NEXT

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:37.585 region:rollup2
THREE DECADES

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:38.953 region:rollup2
BUT IT MAY BE TIME TO START

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:40.789 region:rollup2
GIVING MORE AUTHORITY AND MORE

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:42.724 region:rollup2
DISCRETION TO CAL RECYCLE IN

01:32:40.789 --> 01:32:43.992 region:rollup2
TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD.

01:32:42.724 --> 01:32:45.493 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE

01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:47.262 region:rollup2
PUTTING OUT THE FIRE WHAT WE

01:32:45.493 --> 01:32:48.396 region:rollup2
NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW TO PUT OUT

01:32:47.262 --> 01:32:50.432 region:rollup2
THE FIRE. SOME.

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:51.900 region:rollup2
I WOULD REFER TO.

01:32:50.432 --> 01:32:54.002 region:rollup2
THE ACTION ALERT THAT WE PUT OUT

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:55.970 region:rollup2
IN SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:32:54.002 --> 01:32:56.805 region:rollup2
SOLUTION LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.339 region:rollup2
BEFORE BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME

01:32:56.805 --> 01:33:00.141 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:03.044 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO RETURN RECYCLING

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:04.946 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS THE THE THE COST BASIS

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:06.448 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE RECYCLING PAYMENTS

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:08.083 region:rollup2
TO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN LEVELS

01:33:06.448 --> 01:33:09.751 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WE HAD IT

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:11.553 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT WAS PRIOR TO THE LOSS

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:12.587 region:rollup2
OF ALL THESE RECYCLING CENTERS.

01:33:11.553 --> 01:33:14.189 region:rollup2
NOW THERE NEEDS TO BE A COLA

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:16.224 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENT AND WE NEED TO APPLY

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:18.026 region:rollup2
THAT REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURN

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:20.462 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE TO THAT TWENTY

01:33:18.026 --> 01:33:21.896 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN COST. BUT BUT THAT'S THE

01:33:20.462 --> 01:33:23.832 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO IMPLEMENT THAT COST

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:25.567 region:rollup2
BASIS.

01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:27.101 region:rollup2
A NUMBER TWO WE NEED TO CREATE

01:33:25.567 --> 01:33:29.571 region:rollup2
SOME FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:32.140 region:rollup2
BRING RECYCLING CENTERS BACK TO

01:33:29.571 --> 01:33:34.008 region:rollup2
THESE CLOSED UNSERVED A AREAS OF

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:35.844 region:rollup2
THE STATE. ON IT'S BEEN POINTED

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:38.246 region:rollup2
OUT WE'VE LOST ALMOST A THOUSAND

01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:39.714 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTERS THIRTY EIGHT

01:33:38.246 --> 01:33:41.549 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:42.584 region:rollup2
BOB WE DIDN'T LOSE THIRTY EIGHT

01:33:41.549 --> 01:33:44.285 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR.

01:33:42.584 --> 01:33:47.255 region:rollup2
RECYCLING VOLUME.

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:49.357 region:rollup2
SO I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:50.859 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO BRING BACK.

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:51.960 region:rollup2
NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO

01:33:50.859 --> 01:33:53.828 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTERS TO THE STATE

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.964 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA BUT THERE ARE

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:57.565 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. THAT

01:33:55.964 --> 01:33:59.133 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:33:57.565 --> 01:34:00.368 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAT.

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:02.704 region:rollup2
HAVE NO CONVENIENT RECYCLING

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:04.939 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

01:34:02.704 --> 01:34:06.407 region:rollup2
THE THE RECYCLING RATES

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:07.976 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE DOWN IN THOSE

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:10.845 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND AS SUSAN POINTED

01:34:07.976 --> 01:34:13.448 region:rollup2
OUT THE OTHER COST HAS BEEN.

01:34:10.845 --> 01:34:14.449 region:rollup2
THAT NOT P. ET NOT ALUMINUM BUT

01:34:13.448 --> 01:34:15.817 region:rollup2
WITH THE CLOSURE OF THOSE

01:34:14.449 --> 01:34:18.353 region:rollup2
RECYCLING.

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:19.921 region:rollup2
CENTERS GLASS VOLUME HAS SHIFTED

01:34:18.353 --> 01:34:21.289 region:rollup2
THE CURBSIDE AND HAS BEEN

01:34:19.921 --> 01:34:22.757 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT.

01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:24.092 region:rollup2
CURBSIDE IS NOT THE VERY BEST

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:25.760 region:rollup2
WAY OF RECYCLING YOUR GLASS

01:34:24.092 --> 01:34:27.362 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS YOU DON'T GET A

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.930 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT RECOVERY OF

01:34:27.362 --> 01:34:30.431 region:rollup2
THOSE GLASS CONTAINERS.

01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:32.634 region:rollup2
COST BURDEN FOR THE CURBSIDE

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:34.335 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT'S A LOS RECYCLING FOR

01:34:32.634 --> 01:34:36.104 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:37.539 region:rollup2
IT'S A HIGHER COST OF PROCESSING

01:34:36.104 --> 01:34:38.673 region:rollup2
THAT MATERIAL FOR THE GLASS

01:34:37.539 --> 01:34:40.408 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES.

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:41.476 region:rollup2
SO BRINGING BACK THAT

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:43.478 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:34:41.476 --> 01:34:44.779 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY DOES IT.

01:34:43.478 --> 01:34:47.148 region:rollup2
FILL THAT PROMISE TO THE

01:34:44.779 --> 01:34:48.316 region:rollup2
CONSUMER OF OF BRING BACK UP

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:49.284 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THEM WITH AN

01:34:48.316 --> 01:34:51.219 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY GET THEIR NICKELS

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:53.388 region:rollup2
BACK BUT IT SUSAN POINT OUT IT

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:55.089 region:rollup2
REDUCES THE OVERALL COST OF THE

01:34:53.388 --> 01:34:58.126 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT

01:34:55.089 --> 01:35:00.962 region:rollup2
MOVES THE MATERIAL TO THE PLACE.

01:34:58.126 --> 01:35:02.263 region:rollup2
WHERE IT HAD BOMB IT?

01:35:00.962 --> 01:35:03.765 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE ITS HIGHEST RECYCLING

01:35:02.263 --> 01:35:05.833 region:rollup2
RATE AT ITS LOWEST COST.

01:35:03.765 --> 01:35:06.568 region:rollup2
BOB.

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:08.903 region:rollup2
ALSO WANNA.

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:10.872 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT OF

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:11.472 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE THIS IS SPEAKING TO US

01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:11.839 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TINGS ISSUE IN

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.708 region:rollup2
TERMS

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:15.810 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GET.

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:17.612 region:rollup2
TO ZERO WASTE WHAT WE NEED TO DO

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:18.413 region:rollup2
NEXT AND AND MAYBE THIS FITS

01:35:17.612 --> 01:35:20.215 region:rollup2
INTO THE REDECORATING ASPECT OF

01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:23.017 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:24.485 region:rollup2
BOB BUT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT

01:35:23.017 --> 01:35:25.820 region:rollup2
WE DID A FABULOUS JOB OF

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:27.355 region:rollup2
COLLECTING BEVERAGE CONTAINERS

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.824 region:rollup2
FOR RECYCLING IN THE STATE.

01:35:27.355 --> 01:35:31.025 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT RECYCLING

01:35:29.824 --> 01:35:33.127 region:rollup2
IS A GREAT COLLECTION RIGHT.

01:35:31.025 --> 01:35:34.829 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:37.098 region:rollup2
PLASTIC IS NOW THE SINGLE

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:37.665 region:rollup2
LARGEST CONTAINER IN OUR

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:38.666 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:40.568 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:42.003 region:rollup2
WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING IN

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:43.805 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM PLASTIC CONTAINERS

01:35:42.003 --> 01:35:45.773 region:rollup2
WERE TWO PERCENT. OF THE MARKET

01:35:43.805 --> 01:35:48.276 region:rollup2
SHARE NOW THERE IN EXCESS OF

01:35:45.773 --> 01:35:50.345 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT MARKET SHARE THE.

01:35:48.276 --> 01:35:51.913 region:rollup2
HAVE SURPASSED ALUMINUM CANS.

01:35:50.345 --> 01:35:53.881 region:rollup2
AND UNLIKE ALUMINUM CANS

01:35:51.913 --> 01:35:55.650 region:rollup2
PLASTIC CONTAINERS THE SCRAP

01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:57.051 region:rollup2
VALUE FOR THE PLASTIC CONTAINER

01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:58.519 region:rollup2
ISN'T SUFFICIENT TO COVER THAT

01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:58.686 region:rollup2
COST RECYCLING.

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.722 region:rollup2
SO.

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:02.490 region:rollup2
.

01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:04.759 region:rollup2
WE NEED THAT THE THE MARKET

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:06.427 region:rollup2
BASED MECHANISMS IN THIS PROGRAM

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:08.696 region:rollup2
TO REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURERS TO

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:11.065 region:rollup2
COVER THE FULL COST RECYCLING.

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:12.767 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT ASKING

01:36:11.065 --> 01:36:13.935 region:rollup2
THE MANUFACTURES TO PAY ONE

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:15.236 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THAT NET COST

01:36:13.935 --> 01:36:16.971 region:rollup2
RECYCLING.

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:18.773 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOMEONE REDEEM MONEY

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:20.908 region:rollup2
THAT PUMP RIGHT NOW WITH LOW

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:22.744 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATES HE SUFFICIENT TO

01:36:20.908 --> 01:36:23.911 region:rollup2
COVER THAT NET COST RECYCLING.

01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:25.747 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:27.181 region:rollup2
BACK TO AN EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE

01:36:25.747 --> 01:36:28.950 region:rollup2
PERCENT RECYCLING RATE AS WE

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:30.818 region:rollup2
MOVE CLOSER TO. A HUNDRED

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:32.387 region:rollup2
PERCENT RECYCLING.

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:33.521 region:rollup2
THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS ARE

01:36:32.387 --> 01:36:35.223 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY A GREATER

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:36.124 region:rollup2
SHARE OF THAT KNOCK THAT NET

01:36:35.223 --> 01:36:37.992 region:rollup2
COST RECYCLING.

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:40.662 region:rollup2
AND.

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:41.262 region:rollup2
STATUTE LIMITS THE AMOUNT THAT

01:36:40.662 --> 01:36:43.197 region:rollup2
THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURERS PAY

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:44.799 region:rollup2
ON.

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:47.435 region:rollup2
THAT THE LIMITS THAT WERE SET IN

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:49.137 region:rollup2
STATUTE A DECADE AGO MADE SENSE

01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:50.338 region:rollup2
A DECADE AGO WHEN THE RECYCLING

01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:52.540 region:rollup2
RATE WAS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. AND

01:36:50.338 --> 01:36:54.809 region:rollup2
WE HAD UP.

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.811 region:rollup2
PILE OF UNREDEEMED MONEY BUT WE

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:58.613 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT AS THAT RECYCLING RATE

01:36:56.811 --> 01:37:00.181 region:rollup2
GOES UP THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

01:36:58.613 --> 01:37:01.482 region:rollup2
MONEY IS GOING TO COME DOWN. AND

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:03.985 region:rollup2
THE BEVERAGE MANUFACTURES GOING

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:05.687 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO PAY A GREATER SHARE

01:37:03.985 --> 01:37:07.789 region:rollup2
OF THE NET COST RECYCLING. NOW

01:37:05.687 --> 01:37:09.424 region:rollup2
WE MAY NEVER HAVE TO ASK THEM TO

01:37:07.789 --> 01:37:11.993 region:rollup2
PAY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

01:37:09.424 --> 01:37:13.394 region:rollup2
OF RECOVERING THEIR CONTAINERS

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:14.862 region:rollup2
RETURNING THEIR CONTAINERS TO

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:16.631 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:18.499 region:rollup2
TO THE GLASS INDUSTRY

01:37:16.631 --> 01:37:20.001 region:rollup2
TO THE PT INDUSTRY BUT WE MAY

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:21.135 region:rollup2
NEED TO ASK THEM TO PAY MORE

01:37:20.001 --> 01:37:22.337 region:rollup2
THAN THE ELEVEN PERCENT. THAT

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:24.305 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PAYING RIGHT NOW.

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:25.340 region:rollup2
.

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:27.809 region:rollup2
FINALLY IN YOU KNOW KIND OF

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:29.143 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS IS BOB.

01:37:27.809 --> 01:37:30.712 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:32.480 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF.

01:37:30.712 --> 01:37:34.816 region:rollup2
A GLASS CONTAINER.

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.251 region:rollup2
A GLASS INDUSTRY IS TAKING BACK

01:37:34.816 --> 01:37:38.753 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMING FIFTY PERCENT OF

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:40.888 region:rollup2
THE GLASS CONTAINERS THAT ARE

01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:42.423 region:rollup2
SOLD SO THE GLASS CONTAINERS

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:43.791 region:rollup2
THEIR MANUFACTURING CALIFORNIA

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:45.927 region:rollup2
ARE MADE WITH FIFTY PERCENT

01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:47.228 region:rollup2
RECYCLED CONTENT.

01:37:45.927 --> 01:37:48.763 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PLASTIC SIDE THE STORY

01:37:47.228 --> 01:37:50.031 region:rollup2
IS MUCH DIFFERENT.

01:37:48.763 --> 01:37:51.799 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN SOME FABULOUS PRESS

01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:54.302 region:rollup2
RELEASES FROM BEVERAGE COMPANIES

01:37:51.799 --> 01:37:56.104 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THEIR DESIRE TO

01:37:54.302 --> 01:37:58.072 region:rollup2
INCREASE THEIR USE OF RECYCLED

01:37:56.104 --> 01:37:59.140 region:rollup2
CONTENT IN CONTAINERS AND I

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:00.875 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S GREAT BUT I DON'T

01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:02.410 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN RELY. ON THE

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:03.277 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARY EFFORTS OF THE

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:05.012 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE INDUSTRY.

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:05.913 region:rollup2
I SAW.

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:07.181 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST

01:38:05.913 --> 01:38:09.851 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:12.053 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SCRAP PRICE WHEN WHEN

MOVED AWAY FROM PETROLEUM FOR

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:17.125 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION FOR ENERGY NEEDS.

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:18.426 region:rollup2
THAT REDUCED.

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:20.862 region:rollup2
COST

01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:22.797 region:rollup2
OF PETROLEUM.

01:38:20.862 --> 01:38:23.965 region:rollup2
TRONG LIAM NATURAL GAS THE WRONG

GREETINGS TO MAKE YOUR PLASTIC

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:30.104 region:rollup2
THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY THE BOTTLE

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:31.639 region:rollup2
MAKERS THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY.

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:33.207 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEIR COMMITMENT A BUYING

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:35.576 region:rollup2
RECYCLED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:38.413 region:rollup2
PASS UP THE EXTRAORDINARY LOW

01:38:35.576 --> 01:38:40.515 region:rollup2
PRICES FOR THE VIRGIN PLASTIC SO

01:38:38.413 --> 01:38:42.784 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO ENSURE. THAT THE

01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:44.652 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE INDUSTRY IS ALWAYS

01:38:42.784 --> 01:38:46.421 region:rollup2
BUYING BACK THAT PLASTIC CLOSING

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:48.256 region:rollup2
THE LOOP INCORPORATED INTO THEIR

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:50.024 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS WE'VE GOTTA HAVE

01:38:48.256 --> 01:38:51.759 region:rollup2
MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT ACROSS

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:54.428 region:rollup2
THE BOARD WE HAVE MINIMUM

CONTENT. FOR GLASS CONTAINERS IN

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:57.365 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY IS EXCEEDED THOSE

01:38:55.196 --> 01:38:59.133 region:rollup2
NUMBERS WE NEED TO HAVE MINIMUM

01:38:57.365 --> 01:39:00.535 region:rollup2
RECYCLE CONTENT MANDATES FOR ALL

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:01.602 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS.

01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:03.771 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S PEACE

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:05.940 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT THAT

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:06.741 region:rollup2
WOULD DO EXACTLY THAT SO ON

01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:08.409 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOTTA BE PART OF THE

01:39:06.741 --> 01:39:10.111 region:rollup2
SOLUTION UNDER OF THAT FITS INTO

01:39:08.409 --> 01:39:11.712 region:rollup2
THEPUTTING OUT THE FIRE OR IT

01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:13.314 region:rollup2
FITS INTO THE REDECORATING. BUT

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:15.950 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOTTA BE AN ELEMENT OF

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:17.385 region:rollup2
THE OF THE SOLUTION.

01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:18.519 region:rollup2
AGAIN PART OF THE REDECORATING

01:39:17.385 --> 01:39:19.821 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MAY INCLUDE THE FACT

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:21.756 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:39:19.821 --> 01:39:23.357 region:rollup2
AGAIN SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX

01:39:21.756 --> 01:39:24.859 region:rollup2
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE COST TO

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:26.961 region:rollup2
RECYCLING AND WE'VE WE'VE

01:39:24.859 --> 01:39:29.363 region:rollup2
APPLIED THE SAME STATEWIDE

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:30.198 region:rollup2
AVERAGE COST RECYCLING TO EVERY

01:39:29.363 --> 01:39:31.499 region:rollup2
RECYCLING BUSINESS IN THE STATE

01:39:30.198 --> 01:39:33.334 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:39:31.499 --> 01:39:35.002 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'VE RECOGNIZED OVER

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:36.871 region:rollup2
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT.

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:39.207 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUSINESSES DIFFERENT

01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:40.842 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE

01:39:39.207 --> 01:39:42.777 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COSTS BASED ON THEIR

01:39:40.842 --> 01:39:44.245 region:rollup2
VOLUME AND BASED ON THEIR THEIR

01:39:42.777 --> 01:39:46.614 region:rollup2
DISTANCE FROM MARKETS.

01:39:44.245 --> 01:39:50.051 region:rollup2
SO WE MADE NEED TO WE HAVE TO

01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:51.552 region:rollup2
AMEND THE STATUTE TO EITHER. SET

01:39:50.051 --> 01:39:53.488 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENTIAL A TIERED.

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:55.022 region:rollup2
PROCESSING PAYMENT HANDLING FEE

01:39:53.488 --> 01:39:56.991 region:rollup2
SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE DIFFERENT

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:59.026 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURES BASED

01:39:56.991 --> 01:40:00.261 region:rollup2
ON THEIR ACTUAL COSTS OR WE NEED

01:39:59.026 --> 01:40:01.462 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE THAT DISCRETION TO

01:40:00.261 --> 01:40:02.997 region:rollup2
CAL RECYCLE TO IMPLEMENT IT

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:05.132 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:06.834 region:rollup2
SO. WE DON'T NEED OVER PAY FOR

01:40:05.132 --> 01:40:07.835 region:rollup2
RECYCLING BUT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:09.670 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING THE RIGHT

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:11.405 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO COVER THE COST OF

01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:12.940 region:rollup2
RECYCLING THOSE CONTAINERS.

01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:15.109 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.977 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT ONLY

01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:17.578 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR COVERING THAT

01:40:15.977 --> 01:40:19.614 region:rollup2
COST RECYCLING BUT ALSO FOR

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:20.915 region:rollup2
USING THE MATERIAL THAT WE

01:40:19.614 --> 01:40:21.949 region:rollup2
COLLECT FOR RECYCLING IN

01:40:20.915 --> 01:40:24.418 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:25.820 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY I THINK AGAIN I

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:27.221 region:rollup2
THINK THAT OF.

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.290 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION IN THE WORLD

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:31.559 region:rollup2
RECYCLING IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING

01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:34.095 region:rollup2
AND IT MAY NO LONGER MAKE SENSE.

01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:36.130 region:rollup2
DICTATE ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF

01:40:34.095 --> 01:40:37.398 region:rollup2
THIS LAW IN STATUTE WE MAY NEED

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:39.767 region:rollup2
TO LOOK TO INCREASING THE

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:40.301 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY. THE DISCRETION

01:40:39.767 --> 01:40:42.904 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FOR CALPERS

01:40:40.301 --> 01:40:44.639 region:rollup2

01:40:42.904 --> 01:40:47.241 region:rollup2
THANK FOR THANK YOU.

01:40:44.639 --> 01:40:50.678 region:rollup2

THE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES THAT

01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:56.817 region:rollup2
WE HEARD ABOUT HOW THEY'RE

01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:59.120 region:rollup2
TAKING PLACE IN OREGON OTHER

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:59.453 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW SO.

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:03.524 region:rollup2
IT IT I THINK THAT IT'S

IMPORTANT RECOGNIZE IT.

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:06.861 region:rollup2
ORGAN IS A SMALLER STATE THERE

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:08.029 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED I THINK WAS

01:41:06.861 --> 01:41:10.064 region:rollup2
POINT ABOUT SOME TWENTY FOUR

01:41:08.029 --> 01:41:11.599 region:rollup2
HUNDRED. GROCERY STORES

01:41:10.064 --> 01:41:12.900 region:rollup2
PROVIDING REDEMPTION.

01:41:11.599 --> 01:41:14.168 region:rollup2
TECHNICALLY WE HAVE MORE THAN

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:16.337 region:rollup2
THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:17.004 region:rollup2
THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED GROCERY

01:41:16.337 --> 01:41:18.673 region:rollup2
STORES IN THE STATE OF

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:20.274 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE TECHNICALLY

01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:20.808 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING.

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.176 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS BACK INSIDE THE

STORE.

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:24.211 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE DRINKING

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:25.746 region:rollup2
IN OREGON VERSES WHAT THEY'RE

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:27.949 region:rollup2
DRINKING CALIFORNIA BUT THE

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:28.382 region:rollup2
GROCERY STORES ARE NOT EXCITED

01:41:27.949 --> 01:41:29.750 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT RECYCLING

OPPORTUNITY.

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:32.253 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT PROMOTING THAT

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:34.055 region:rollup2
RECYCLING OPPORTUNITY.

01:41:32.253 --> 01:41:36.023 region:rollup2
SO.

01:41:34.055 --> 01:41:37.858 region:rollup2
THE OREGON LAW HAS ALWAYS BEEN

01:41:36.023 --> 01:41:40.494 region:rollup2
BASED ON BRINGING CONTAINERS

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:41.195 region:rollup2
BACK INSIDE THE STORE. FARM AND

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.463 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD BE VERY ALL

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:44.599 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AS A GREAT DEAL OF

01:41:42.463 --> 01:41:46.233 region:rollup2
RESISTANCE TO THAT. BY THE A

01:41:44.599 --> 01:41:48.202 region:rollup2
GROCER NEAR IT AND AND SO THERE

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:51.172 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER IN

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:53.007 region:rollup2
REACH IN REBOOTING THIS PROGRAM.

01:41:51.172 --> 01:41:54.909 region:rollup2
DO WE WANT TO PUT GREATER

01:41:53.007 --> 01:41:56.043 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE GROCERY

01:41:54.909 --> 01:41:58.579 region:rollup2

DEALERS THAT DISTRIBUTE BEVERAGE

01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:04.952 region:rollup2
CONTAINERS THAT SELL TO

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.287 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:07.555 region:rollup2
WERE SITE IN THE STATE OF

01:42:06.287 --> 01:42:09.190 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. OR DO WE WANT TO

01:42:07.555 --> 01:42:11.192 region:rollup2
FOCUS.

01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:12.893 region:rollup2
OUR RECYCLING DOLLARS ON

01:42:11.192 --> 01:42:14.495 region:rollup2
CREATING FULL SERVICE RECYCLING

OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE PLACES

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:18.299 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED IT AGAIN IT'S

01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:20.267 region:rollup2
TELLING THAT WITH THE CLOSURE OF

01:42:18.299 --> 01:42:22.603 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTERS.

01:42:20.267 --> 01:42:23.771 region:rollup2
BOB WE DIDN'T LOSE THIRTY EIGHT

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:25.039 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE RECYCLING VOLUME

01:42:23.771 --> 01:42:26.674 region:rollup2
OF.

01:42:25.039 --> 01:42:28.576 region:rollup2
ITS ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND IT'S

01:42:26.674 --> 01:42:29.977 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL THAT WE DID LOSE YOU

01:42:28.576 --> 01:42:31.245 region:rollup2
KNOW FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.747 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR BEVERAGE

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:33.914 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING AT A TIME

01:42:32.747 --> 01:42:35.549 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WANT TO INCREASE THAT

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:37.018 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE. UP TO EIGHTY

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:39.286 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT NINETY PERCENT

01:42:37.018 --> 01:42:40.921 region:rollup2
RECYCLING SO WE NEED MORE

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:43.424 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE. MOM

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:44.925 region:rollup2
BUT THE CONSUMER HAS IN

01:42:43.424 --> 01:42:47.261 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:49.930 region:rollup2
CONSUMER HAS DEMONSTRATED A

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:52.266 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO.

01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:54.802 region:rollup2
USE A FULL SERVICE RECYCLING

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:55.403 region:rollup2
CENTER AS OPPOSED TO

01:42:54.802 --> 01:42:57.204 region:rollup2
TAKING CONTAINERS BACK INSIDE

01:42:55.403 --> 01:42:58.506 region:rollup2
THE STORE.

01:42:57.204 --> 01:43:01.075 region:rollup2
BUT I WONDER IF THAT ISN'T OUT

01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:03.744 region:rollup2
OF NECESSITY AS OPPOSED TO A

01:43:01.075 --> 01:43:05.913 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE AND IF WE WERE TO.

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:08.549 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT FOR

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:10.217 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER WOULD WE NOT TESSA

01:43:08.549 --> 01:43:11.852 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS REALLY. I THINK A

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:13.888 region:rollup2
QUESTION TO PONDER NOT

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:16.157 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY ANSWER TODAY. BUT.

01:43:13.888 --> 01:43:17.858 region:rollup2
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET CLOSER

01:43:16.157 --> 01:43:20.027 region:rollup2
TO THAT DOT NET ZERO RECYCLING

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:21.162 region:rollup2
GO.

01:43:20.027 --> 01:43:24.065 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT MAKING IT MORE

01:43:21.162 --> 01:43:25.199 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT BOMB IS ABSOLUTELY.

01:43:24.065 --> 01:43:26.901 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW PART OF THE

01:43:25.199 --> 01:43:29.070 region:rollup2
SOLUTION I WOULD LOVE TO HAPPEN

01:43:26.901 --> 01:43:32.039 region:rollup2
I'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:33.674 region:rollup2
TO ARE TAKE MY BAG OF

01:43:32.039 --> 01:43:35.476 region:rollup2
RECYCLABLES INSTEAD OF STANDING

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:36.677 region:rollup2
IN LINE WHICH I NOW HAVE TO DO

01:43:35.476 --> 01:43:38.612 region:rollup2
ONCE A MONTH WHEN I TAKE MY

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:40.881 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTER TO THE ONE

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:42.650 region:rollup2
REMAINING. RECYCLING CENTER IN

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:44.552 region:rollup2
MY COMMUNITY THAT I'VE GOT TO

01:43:42.650 --> 01:43:46.854 region:rollup2
STAND IN LINE AND I'M STANDING

01:43:44.552 --> 01:43:48.722 region:rollup2
IN LINE WITH LOTS OF OTHER

01:43:46.854 --> 01:43:50.224 region:rollup2
SOCCER MOMS AND DADS AND FOLKS

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:51.992 region:rollup2
THAT ARE. EITHER THE REDEEMING

01:43:50.224 --> 01:43:53.561 region:rollup2
IT FOR CASH OR THE REDEEMING IT

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:54.795 region:rollup2
FOR A CHURCH OR A CLUB OR A

01:43:53.561 --> 01:43:56.931 region:rollup2
SOCCER TEAM.

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:59.366 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE ALL STANDING IN LINE

01:43:56.931 --> 01:44:01.669 region:rollup2
TO GET OUR FIFTEEN TWENTY THIRTY

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:04.138 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WORTH OF OF REDEMPTION

01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:05.673 region:rollup2
VALUE AND. I'M SURE IT'S COST ME

01:44:04.138 --> 01:44:07.742 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS

01:44:05.673 --> 01:44:09.343 region:rollup2
TO BE STANDING IN LINE SO MAKING

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:10.945 region:rollup2
IT MORE CONVENIENT HAVING A

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:12.613 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

01:44:10.945 --> 01:44:14.482 region:rollup2
ABLE TO THAT'S THAT'S MORE

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:16.317 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT. NOT NECESSARILY

01:44:14.482 --> 01:44:18.119 region:rollup2
BASED ON ITS PHYSICAL LOCATION

01:44:16.317 --> 01:44:19.587 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT OPPORTUNITY

01:44:18.119 --> 01:44:21.689 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSACTION AT THE

01:44:19.587 --> 01:44:23.858 region:rollup2
RECYCLING CENTER SO I'M IN AND

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:26.360 region:rollup2
OUT. I THINK THAT YOU THAT WOULD

01:44:23.858 --> 01:44:27.728 region:rollup2
BE THAT THAT ELEMENT OF

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:30.798 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:44:27.728 --> 01:44:32.266 region:rollup2
CAN WE SHOULD BE EXPLORING. ON

01:44:30.798 --> 01:44:34.301 region:rollup2
IT IS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM.

01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:36.871 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED IN THE

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:38.672 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE FOCUS

01:44:36.871 --> 01:44:41.609 region:rollup2
THIS THIS BUYBACK RECYCLING

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:42.843 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO SO FEW LOCATIONS

01:44:41.609 --> 01:44:44.912 region:rollup2
AND IT IS CREATING THE THE THE

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:46.647 region:rollup2
HANDFUL OF RECYCLING LOCATIONS

01:44:44.912 --> 01:44:48.449 region:rollup2
THAT REMAIN. IN GROCERY STORE

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:50.518 region:rollup2
PARKING LOTS ARE PUTTING A LOT

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:52.720 region:rollup2
OF PRESSURE ON THOSE LOCATIONS

01:44:50.518 --> 01:44:54.989 region:rollup2
SO. HAVING MORE PHYSICAL

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.223 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS WILL RELIEVE SOME OF

01:44:54.989 --> 01:44:57.958 region:rollup2
THE PRESSURE AND SOME OF THE

01:44:56.223 --> 01:45:00.694 region:rollup2
ANGST IN NEIGHBORHOODS ABOUT

01:44:57.958 --> 01:45:02.596 region:rollup2
HAVING. LONG LINES OF PEOPLE

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:03.998 region:rollup2
LOUD NOISES FROM THAT RECYCLING

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:05.499 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU KNOW THERE

01:45:03.998 --> 01:45:08.135 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:09.203 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER IMPACTS BESIDES

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:10.805 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:13.407 region:rollup2
EVALUATING.

01:45:10.805 --> 01:45:16.310 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON.

01:45:13.407 --> 01:45:16.644 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO A.

CONVENIENCE.

01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:20.247 region:rollup2
.

01:45:19.113 --> 01:45:21.882 region:rollup2
ISN'T THE MOST CONVENIENT WAY

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:23.517 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE.

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:25.186 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THEIR RECYCLABLES

01:45:23.517 --> 01:45:27.321 region:rollup2
IS TO SEPARATE AT THE CURB AND

01:45:25.186 --> 01:45:29.190 region:rollup2
SENATE TO THE WAY CENTER.

01:45:27.321 --> 01:45:30.758 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT I I YOU SUGGESTING

01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:31.358 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT WOULD UPSET ME

01:45:30.758 --> 01:45:31.892 region:rollup2
JUST TELL YOU WHAT THE DILEMMA

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:33.794 region:rollup2
IS HERE.

01:45:31.892 --> 01:45:35.029 region:rollup2
.

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:36.730 region:rollup2
AYE WAS MY FRESNO FOR EIGHT

01:45:35.029 --> 01:45:38.532 region:rollup2
YEARS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:40.868 region:rollup2
HIGH RECYCLING.

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:42.136 region:rollup2
LEVEL BUT. IT TOOK US

01:45:40.868 --> 01:45:43.137 region:rollup2
A PERIOD OF TIME AND SOME VERY

01:45:42.136 --> 01:45:44.505 region:rollup2
HARD WORK.

01:45:43.137 --> 01:45:45.906 region:rollup2
WE DESERVE WE DESIGNED AND

01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:47.808 region:rollup2
UTILIZED THIS THAT THREE CAN

01:45:45.906 --> 01:45:51.345 region:rollup2
SEPARATION IT IS.

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:53.314 region:rollup2
UNIFORM ONLY USED.

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:56.784 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IS

01:45:53.314 --> 01:45:58.185 region:rollup2
THE MOST. AND THAT GOT US.

01:45:56.784 --> 01:45:59.220 region:rollup2
ABOVE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE WE

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:01.155 region:rollup2
WERE GETTING THREATEN WITH TEN

01:45:59.220 --> 01:46:03.290 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR A DAY FINE.

01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:05.593 region:rollup2
SO WE DID WE DESIGNED A VERY

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:07.261 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT WAY OF DOING IT ARE

01:46:05.593 --> 01:46:09.730 region:rollup2
YOU SUGGESTING IN ANY WAY ON

01:46:07.261 --> 01:46:11.632 region:rollup2
DOING THAT CONVENE.

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.666 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY NOT

01:46:11.632 --> 01:46:14.335 region:rollup2
ADJUSTING THAT WE UNDO.

01:46:12.666 --> 01:46:15.236 region:rollup2
.

01:46:14.335 --> 01:46:17.004 region:rollup2
A CURBSIDE RECYCLING

01:46:15.236 --> 01:46:19.540 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN FACT I WOULD

01:46:17.004 --> 01:46:22.042 region:rollup2
IN IN RESTATING ONE OF THE THE

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:23.577 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT SUSAN MADE OF THE

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:25.145 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THIS SYSTEM THIS

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:27.548 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA REDEMPTION SYSTEMS.

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:29.583 region:rollup2
EXPANDS IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:30.084 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORTING

01:46:29.583 --> 01:46:31.986 region:rollup2
THAT CURBSIDE RECYCLING

01:46:30.084 --> 01:46:33.220 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK THAT'S A

01:46:31.986 --> 01:46:34.722 region:rollup2
GOOD THING SO I THINK IT'S

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:36.790 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT.

01:46:34.722 --> 01:46:38.192 region:rollup2
THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DOESN'T

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:39.793 region:rollup2
PLAY FAVORITES IN TERMS OF

01:46:38.192 --> 01:46:40.361 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT IN

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:42.096 region:rollup2
FACT SUPPORTS THE CURBSIDE

01:46:40.361 --> 01:46:44.098 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INTEREST.

01:46:42.096 --> 01:46:46.033 region:rollup2
THAT'S SAID.

01:46:44.098 --> 01:46:47.868 region:rollup2
WE NOW KNOW THAT THE CURBSIDE

01:46:46.033 --> 01:46:48.903 region:rollup2
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:46:47.868 --> 01:46:50.671 region:rollup2
CRAPPIE SYSTEM FOR RECYCLING

01:46:48.903 --> 01:46:51.939 region:rollup2
GLASS CONTAINERS.

01:46:50.671 --> 01:46:54.208 region:rollup2
IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THE CURBSIDE

01:46:51.939 --> 01:46:56.844 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:46:54.208 --> 01:46:57.945 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE FOR THE THE BEVERAGE

01:46:56.844 --> 01:46:59.647 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS THE GLASS

01:46:57.945 --> 01:47:00.681 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURES THE DON'T WANT THAT

01:46:59.647 --> 01:47:02.349 region:rollup2
CLASS THAT'S COMING FROM THE

01:47:00.681 --> 01:47:04.652 region:rollup2
CURBSIDE PROGRAM.

01:47:02.349 --> 01:47:06.520 region:rollup2
PICTURE THAT DATA SUSAN SHOWED

01:47:04.652 --> 01:47:08.188 region:rollup2
OF THE DIVESTITURE I I'VE BEEN

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:09.823 region:rollup2
TO ALL THOSE LOCATIONS I

01:47:08.188 --> 01:47:10.691 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES IN

01:47:09.823 --> 01:47:13.494 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS.

01:47:10.691 --> 01:47:15.162 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:47:13.494 --> 01:47:16.430 region:rollup2
WHAT SO FINISHED FINISH YOUR

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:18.198 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMENT WHAT WHAT SO I

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:20.067 region:rollup2
POINT IS THAT WE HAVE THE BEST

01:47:18.198 --> 01:47:22.303 region:rollup2
OF BOTH WORLDS RIGHT NOW?

01:47:20.067 --> 01:47:24.538 region:rollup2
HAVE A RECYCLING INCENTIVE THAT

01:47:22.303 --> 01:47:26.840 region:rollup2
PULLS THE MAJORITY OF CONTAINERS

01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:27.408 region:rollup2
INTO A A VERY COST EFFECTIVE AND

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.909 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT BUYBACK RECYCLING

01:47:27.408 --> 01:47:30.210 region:rollup2
CYST.

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:31.612 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE CONSUMERS THAT DON'T

01:47:30.210 --> 01:47:33.147 region:rollup2
WANT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT

01:47:31.612 --> 01:47:34.748 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THE CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:47:33.147 --> 01:47:36.917 region:rollup2
CURBSIDE RECYCLING WHICH IS

01:47:34.748 --> 01:47:38.519 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY UNLIKE ANY OTHER

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:39.920 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY WHICH IS

01:47:38.519 --> 01:47:41.655 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY THE PROGRAM SO WE

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.290 region:rollup2
HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS. I

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:59.473 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S A CHOICE WE

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:59.473 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:10.017 region:rollup2
YOU ASKED THAT THE WONDERFUL

01:48:07.815 --> 01:48:11.518 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN FRESNO HOW WOULD THEY

01:48:10.017 --> 01:48:12.619 region:rollup2
WITH. HOW THEY WOULD FEEL IF

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:13.954 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO INCLUDE

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:15.856 region:rollup2
GLASS IN THEIR CURB SIDE

01:48:13.954 --> 01:48:17.658 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PROGRAM AND I THINK

01:48:15.856 --> 01:48:18.792 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER'S GONNA BE? YOU KNOW

01:48:17.658 --> 01:48:20.194 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S SOME OTHER PLACE

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:22.930 region:rollup2
COULD GO THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

01:48:20.194 --> 01:48:23.931 region:rollup2
YEAH AGAIN I THINK THE THE BIG

01:48:22.930 --> 01:48:26.367 region:rollup2
THINK BIG PROBABLY WITH THE WITH

01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:28.669 region:rollup2
THE. ART LARGER BOURBON AREAS OF

01:48:26.367 --> 01:48:29.837 region:rollup2
LIKE FRESNO IS WE GET WEEK WE

01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:31.105 region:rollup2
GOT PLANNING ON ONE SIDE WHICH

01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:32.373 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SAYS WE'RE GONNA FIND

01:48:31.105 --> 01:48:33.374 region:rollup2
A TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ROLL

01:48:32.373 --> 01:48:35.542 region:rollup2
UP OUR SLEEVES WE GET THE JOB

01:48:33.374 --> 01:48:36.977 region:rollup2
DONE. WE GET THE RECYCLING WAY

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:39.246 region:rollup2
WAY DOWN.

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:40.114 region:rollup2
AND AND AND WE WE WERE OUT FROM

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:41.815 region:rollup2
UNDERNEATH THE THREAT OF THE

01:48:40.114 --> 01:48:44.585 region:rollup2
STATE WHICH WHICH WAS REAL.

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:45.519 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

01:48:44.585 --> 01:48:46.620 region:rollup2
SO I'M HEARING IS YEAH IT'S

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:49.423 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT BUT IT'S

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.991 region:rollup2
WHAT TOO MUCH IN DIRTY.

01:48:49.423 --> 01:48:51.692 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT

01:48:50.991 --> 01:48:53.026 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HEARING ME.

01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:54.728 region:rollup2
POCKET I'M HEARING YOU ON THIS

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:56.830 region:rollup2
I LOVE MY CURB SIDE RECYCLING

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:58.999 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IT IS A PHENOMENAL

01:48:56.830 --> 01:49:00.367 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR RECYCLING THE BULK

01:48:58.999 --> 01:49:03.103 region:rollup2
OF THE RECYCLABLES THAT WE

01:49:00.367 --> 01:49:04.438 region:rollup2
GENERATE OUR HOUSEHOLD WHICH IS

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:05.005 region:rollup2
MOSTLY MIXED WASTE PAPER.

01:49:04.438 --> 01:49:07.007 region:rollup2
A BUNCH A PLASTIC PACKAGING

01:49:05.005 --> 01:49:09.276 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:11.078 region:rollup2
STEEL CANS TIN CANS ON IT IS A

01:49:09.276 --> 01:49:13.414 region:rollup2
GREAT SYSTEM THAT IS IT IT'S

01:49:11.078 --> 01:49:15.916 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY CONVENIENCE.

01:49:13.414 --> 01:49:18.452 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT THE MOST COST

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:19.753 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE SYSTEM WHAT IT

01:49:18.452 --> 01:49:21.688 region:rollup2
BEACHWOOD SYSTEM FOR WHAT I

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:23.457 region:rollup2
FOURTH WHAT A FOURTH SEPARATION

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:25.025 region:rollup2
WORK.

01:49:23.457 --> 01:49:26.994 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T I I I THINK THAT SOME

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:28.262 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS.

01:49:26.994 --> 01:49:29.496 region:rollup2
ACCORDING SEATTLE HAVE HAD THEY

01:49:28.262 --> 01:49:31.865 region:rollup2
HAD OF A POINT IN TIME WHERE

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:32.299 region:rollup2
THEY HAD LITERALLY A SEPARATE

01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:32.766 region:rollup2
BIN FOR THE GLASS.

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:34.802 region:rollup2
.

01:49:32.766 --> 01:49:36.570 region:rollup2
.

01:49:34.802 --> 01:49:38.739 region:rollup2
SO THERE I THINK THAT THAT YOU

01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:40.974 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT'S WORTH EXPLORING.

01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:42.643 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THINK THAT FRESNO HAS

01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:43.377 region:rollup2
DONE A FABULOUS JOB IN TERMS OF

01:49:42.643 --> 01:49:45.179 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THEIR CURBSIDE

01:49:43.377 --> 01:49:46.647 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PROGRAM.

01:49:45.179 --> 01:49:48.449 region:rollup2
BOB I THINK THAT.

01:49:46.647 --> 01:49:50.184 region:rollup2
FRESNO IS AS

01:49:48.449 --> 01:49:51.685 region:rollup2
POINT AT THIS MOMENT IS MAKING A

01:49:50.184 --> 01:49:53.720 region:rollup2
MISTAKE.

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:55.322 region:rollup2
BY CLOSING BUYBACK RECYCLING

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.623 region:rollup2
CENTERS IN THE CITY OF FRESNO

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:57.891 region:rollup2
I'M AWARE I'M AWARE OF THAT AND

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:59.460 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

01:49:57.891 --> 01:50:00.861 region:rollup2
INCREASING THEIR COSTS OF

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:02.496 region:rollup2
RECYCLING AT THE CURBSIDE

01:50:00.861 --> 01:50:04.765 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. THEIR RATE PAYERS GOING

01:50:02.496 --> 01:50:06.834 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO PAY MORE BECAUSE

01:50:04.765 --> 01:50:09.970 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TO GET STOCK MIGHT WITH

01:50:06.834 --> 01:50:10.838 region:rollup2
AYE WORKABLE YES BUT. UNDERSTAND

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.839 region:rollup2
COMPLEX IS BUT.

01:50:10.838 --> 01:50:12.473 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT THE POLITICAL

01:50:11.839 --> 01:50:13.707 region:rollup2
REALITY IN FRESNO IS YOU GOT A

01:50:12.473 --> 01:50:14.975 region:rollup2
LOT OF THESE.

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:16.343 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF THE SITES THAT QUITE

01:50:14.975 --> 01:50:17.211 region:rollup2
FRANKLY ARE GATHERED THEIR TRASH

01:50:16.343 --> 01:50:18.579 region:rollup2
RECYCLERS BUT THEY'RE ALSO TRASH

01:50:17.211 --> 01:50:20.013 region:rollup2
COLLECTORS.

01:50:18.579 --> 01:50:21.615 region:rollup2
THAT IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:23.117 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT SO YOU

01:50:21.615 --> 01:50:24.818 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT CONVENIENCE AND

01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:26.987 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING IT IN

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:29.089 region:rollup2
A WAY. THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:30.190 region:rollup2
AND I WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:31.592 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:35.262 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE.

01:50:31.592 --> 01:50:36.663 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE ISSUE AND SOLVE THE.

01:50:35.262 --> 01:50:38.732 region:rollup2
THE GLASS ISSUE WITH WITH BUT

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:39.600 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME OTHERS OTHER

01:50:38.732 --> 01:50:41.869 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION BRACKET IN MY OWN

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:43.971 region:rollup2
CITY I I I THINK WE CARE WEEK WE

01:50:41.869 --> 01:50:45.639 region:rollup2
COULD DO SOME GOOD THINGS IF. IN

01:50:43.971 --> 01:50:47.474 region:rollup2
FACT THE PROCESS IS ABBOTT DON'T

01:50:45.639 --> 01:50:49.877 region:rollup2
LIKE IT BEVERAGE FOLKS DON'T

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:51.411 region:rollup2
LIKE IT. OUT WE HAVE AN INTEREST

01:50:49.877 --> 01:50:53.113 region:rollup2
IN WE HAVE ONE OF THE MOST.

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:54.381 region:rollup2
CITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ONE

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:56.450 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE.

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:58.685 region:rollup2
WAYS OF SEPARATING AND

01:50:56.450 --> 01:51:00.220 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT TO. IT IF PEOPLE

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:01.655 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT TO GO BACK AND GET

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.956 region:rollup2
THEIR FIVE SENSE THE GOING BACK

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:04.591 region:rollup2
AND GET THEIR FIVE CENTS.

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:06.560 region:rollup2
THEY ARE SAYING IT IS MUCH MORE

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:08.729 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT FOR ME TO PUT IT IN

01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.464 region:rollup2
TO THE BIN. EVERYBODY ON MY

01:51:08.729 --> 01:51:12.900 region:rollup2
BLOCK AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS

01:51:10.464 --> 01:51:14.301 region:rollup2
IN FRESNO SEE THIS AS CONVENIENT

01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:16.103 region:rollup2
AND AS RECYCLING IN THE KIND OF

01:51:14.301 --> 01:51:18.505 region:rollup2
PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK FOR.

01:51:16.103 --> 01:51:20.974 region:rollup2
THAT SEPARATION. I'M I'M WILLING

AS A RESULT RECYCLE PLASTIC

01:54:18.652 --> 01:54:21.488 region:rollup2
SCRAP FROM RECYCLING CENTERS WAS

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:22.956 region:rollup2
NOT AS COMPETITIVE ON THE MARKET

01:54:21.488 --> 01:54:24.224 region:rollup2
THIS CREATED.

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:25.859 region:rollup2

SEEK TO COVER THE DIFFERENCE.

01:54:31.832 --> 01:54:35.035 region:rollup2
BETWEEN RECYCLING CENTER PROFITS

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:36.670 region:rollup2
FROM SALES SCRAP. AND THE COST

01:54:35.035 --> 01:54:37.838 region:rollup2
OF OPERATIONS HOWEVER THE

01:54:36.670 --> 01:54:39.473 region:rollup2
PROGRAM STATUTES ARE VERY

01:54:37.838 --> 01:54:41.007 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIVE AND YOU'VE HEARD

COMPARED TO TWENTY FIFTEEN.

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:56.022 region:rollup2
JUSTICE RECYCLERS WERE ALSO

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:57.958 region:rollup2
RECEIVING LESS FOR RECYCLED

01:54:56.022 --> 01:54:59.426 region:rollup2
SCRAP PLASTIC ON THE MARKET.

01:54:57.958 --> 01:55:01.027 region:rollup2
THE STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES THAT A

RECYCLING CENTER BE LOCATED IN

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:03.830 region:rollup2

WHETHER THE IMPACT OF THE SCRUB

01:55:14.941 --> 01:55:17.210 region:rollup2
MARKET.

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:18.745 region:rollup2
AND THE DROP IN PROGRAM

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:20.046 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIES MANY OF THE LOWER

REAL RECYCLING CENTERS COULD NOT

01:55:21.715 --> 01:55:24.651 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ACCURATE TO SAY THAT

01:55:23.316 --> 01:55:26.419 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:27.354 region:rollup2
RURAL AREAS AND MANY OF THEM IN

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:43.797 region:rollup2
TO TOUCH ON THE RECYCLING RATE

01:56:42.295 --> 01:56:44.865 region:rollup2
FOR JUST A MOMENT ONE OF OUR

01:56:43.797 --> 01:56:45.398 region:rollup2
CRITICAL METRICS.

01:56:44.865 --> 01:56:46.800 region:rollup2
OTHER RECYCLING RATE HAS

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:48.335 region:rollup2
DECLINED AS YOU'VE HEARD BUT WE

01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:50.036 region:rollup2
WANNA BE CAREFUL TO EXAMINE THE

01:56:48.335 --> 01:56:51.771 region:rollup2
MANY FACTORS INFLUENCING THIS

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:53.139 region:rollup2
CHANGE. OUR MOST RECENT BI

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:54.307 region:rollup2
ANNUAL REPORT SHOWS EIGHTEEN

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:55.909 region:rollup2

TWENTY TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTY.

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:01.815 region:rollup2
THIS IS A TWO POINT EIGHT

01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:03.850 region:rollup2
PERCENT DECREASE FROM THE

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:05.452 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS YEAR ONE FACTOR IS THE

01:57:03.850 --> 01:57:06.820 region:rollup2
CLOSURE OF HUNDREDS OF RECYCLING

01:57:05.452 --> 01:57:07.387 region:rollup2
CENTERS AND I DON'T INTEND TO

01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:07.854 region:rollup2
MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THAT

01:57:07.387 --> 01:57:10.757 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:12.692 region:rollup2
OF THOSE CLOSURES A WITH THESE

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:14.127 region:rollup2
AND SUBSEQUENT COMMENTS HERE

01:57:12.692 --> 01:57:15.595 region:rollup2
THAT IT HAS IMPACTED CONSUMERS.

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:17.430 region:rollup2
BUT THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER

01:57:15.595 --> 01:57:18.532 region:rollup2
OF RETURNS REFLECTS A NUMBER OF

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:19.900 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES THAT

01:57:18.532 --> 01:57:21.401 region:rollup2
WE'VE ADOPTED OVER THE LAST

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:23.136 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS THESE INCLUDE

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:24.604 region:rollup2
ELIMINATING THE COMMINGLED RATE

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:25.605 region:rollup2
AT RECYCLING CENTERS THAT IS.

01:57:24.604 --> 01:57:27.207 region:rollup2
PAYING ONLY FOR C. R. V.

01:57:25.605 --> 01:57:29.109 region:rollup2
MATERIAL WHEN CONSUMERS BRING

01:57:27.207 --> 01:57:30.277 region:rollup2
THAT TO A RECYCLING CENTER.

01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:31.444 region:rollup2
WE'VE ESTABLISHED RECORDING

01:57:49.696 --> 01:57:52.799 region:rollup2
WE'VE REDUCED DAILY LOAD LIMITS

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:54.501 region:rollup2
FOR MATERIALS AND THE NUMBER

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:55.035 region:rollup2
POUNDS THAT SOMEONE CAN BRING ON

SUCCESSFUL RECYCLING CENTER.

01:58:04.911 --> 01:58:08.782 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR

01:58:08.281 --> 01:58:10.817 region:rollup2
TO THE RECYCLING RATE IS

01:58:08.782 --> 01:58:11.351 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE SALES.

01:58:10.817 --> 01:58:12.018 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE A

01:58:11.351 --> 01:58:12.686 region:rollup2

NOTABLE.

01:58:26.700 --> 01:58:30.904 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL TREND

01:58:29.869 --> 01:58:31.771 region:rollup2
IS THE INCREASING CONSUMPTION OF

01:58:30.904 --> 01:58:32.706 region:rollup2
BOTTLED WATER.

01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:36.009 region:rollup2

TYPICALLY ON THE VAST MAJORITY

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:49.823 region:rollup2

THE STRUGGLE DEFICIT IS GONE AT

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:58.691 region:rollup2
THIS POINT. AND THE POINT IS TO

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:59.993 region:rollup2
REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT.

01:59:58.691 --> 02:00:01.695 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A

01:59:59.993 --> 02:00:03.163 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL ISSUE BUT IT DOES

02:00:01.695 --> 02:00:04.164 region:rollup2
REFLECT THAT IT THE RECYCLING

02:00:03.163 --> 02:00:04.798 region:rollup2
REYES ON DEBATE KLEIN AND

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:06.032 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

02:00:04.798 --> 02:00:06.599 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE DONE. WITH THE

BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO RETURNS

02:00:14.941 --> 02:00:18.144 region:rollup2
AND THE CHANGE THE INCREASE IN

02:00:16.176 --> 02:00:18.678 region:rollup2

02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:19.172 region:rollup2
ABOUT RECYCLING AND EXPORTS.

02:01:16.603 --> 02:01:20.473 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:01:19.172 --> 02:01:21.841 region:rollup2
ONE MORNING THANK YOU. FOR

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:23.676 region:rollup2
TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:24.511 region:rollup2
AT RECYCLING MORE BROADLY IN THE

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:26.479 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:01:24.511 --> 02:01:28.248 region:rollup2
.

02:01:26.479 --> 02:01:28.848 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A VERY STRONG.

02:01:28.248 --> 02:01:30.717 region:rollup2
COLLECTING SORT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:32.619 region:rollup2
HERE.

02:01:30.717 --> 02:01:33.753 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LACKING IS?

02:01:32.619 --> 02:01:35.421 region:rollup2
A STRONG REMANUFACTURING

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:37.457 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND STRONG

02:01:35.421 --> 02:01:39.192 region:rollup2
DIVERSIFIED MARKETS.

02:01:37.457 --> 02:01:40.260 region:rollup2
THIS LEAVES US VULNERABLE TO

02:01:39.192 --> 02:01:40.927 region:rollup2
UNPREDICTABLE INTERNATIONAL

02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:43.396 region:rollup2
MARKETS FOR RECYCLABLE

02:01:40.927 --> 02:01:44.798 region:rollup2
COMMODITIES.

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:45.798 region:rollup2
MAY GIVE YOU A FEW STATS OF WHAT

02:01:44.798 --> 02:01:47.400 region:rollup2
RECYCLING LOOKS LIKE HERE IN

02:01:45.798 --> 02:01:49.302 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:50.303 region:rollup2
SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FORTY FOUR

02:01:49.302 --> 02:01:51.771 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ALL MATERIALS

02:01:50.303 --> 02:01:56.442 region:rollup2
GENERATED.

02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:56.442 region:rollup2
RECYCLED IN CALIFORNIA.

02:01:56.509 --> 02:01:59.312 region:rollup2
THROWING THEIR BLUE BEEN.

02:01:58.011 --> 02:01:59.946 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO THIRDS TO THREE

02:01:59.312 --> 02:02:03.016 region:rollup2
QUARTERS ARE EXPORTED TO FOREIGN

02:01:59.946 --> 02:02:04.350 region:rollup2
MARKETS.

02:02:03.016 --> 02:02:06.085 region:rollup2
OF THOSE RECYCLABLES EXPORTED

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:07.654 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION

02:02:06.085 --> 02:02:08.521 region:rollup2
TONS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:11.324 region:rollup2
IT'S TO TWO PERCENT OF THOSE

02:02:08.521 --> 02:02:11.991 region:rollup2
WENT TO CHINA.

02:02:11.324 --> 02:02:14.127 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT CHINA

02:02:11.991 --> 02:02:15.929 region:rollup2
HAS HISTORICALLY. ON BEEN THE

02:02:14.127 --> 02:02:17.363 region:rollup2
BUYER OF MANY OF OUR RECYCLABLE

02:02:15.929 --> 02:02:19.299 region:rollup2
COMMODITIES.

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:20.266 region:rollup2
HOWEVER CHINA'S POLICIES FOR

02:02:19.299 --> 02:02:22.502 region:rollup2
RESTRICTING IMPORTS IN RECENT

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:25.238 region:rollup2
YEARS HAVE LED TO DECLINES IN

02:02:22.502 --> 02:02:26.739 region:rollup2
EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES.

02:02:25.238 --> 02:02:28.741 region:rollup2
INDIA'S EXPORTS HAVE BEEN

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:30.009 region:rollup2
DECLINING SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN.

02:02:28.741 --> 02:02:31.945 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY

02:02:30.009 --> 02:02:33.146 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN EXPORTS DECREASED BY

02:02:31.945 --> 02:02:35.882 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT

02:02:33.146 --> 02:02:37.350 region:rollup2
OR TWO MILLION TONS.

02:02:35.882 --> 02:02:39.052 region:rollup2
SO CENTER PRESENTATIONS YOU LAST

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:41.054 region:rollup2
YEAR CHINA IMPOSED MORE

02:02:39.052 --> 02:02:42.922 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIVE IMPORT POLICIES

02:02:41.054 --> 02:02:44.057 region:rollup2
STRAINING OUR EXISTING RECYCLING

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:46.059 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IMMERSING THEM PACKS OF

02:02:44.057 --> 02:02:47.660 region:rollup2
THAT NOW.

02:02:46.059 --> 02:02:48.228 region:rollup2
CHINA ANNOUNCED NATIONAL SOARED

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.663 region:rollup2
POLICY IN JULY OF JUST LAST

02:02:48.228 --> 02:02:52.131 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:53.233 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THAT POLICY IN TO DO

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:54.868 region:rollup2
WAS TO REDUCE IMPORTS OF FOREIGN

02:02:53.233 --> 02:02:56.202 region:rollup2
WASTES

02:02:54.868 --> 02:02:57.737 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOOKING TOUGH. CLEAN UP

02:02:56.202 --> 02:03:00.707 region:rollup2
THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND NO LONGER

02:02:57.737 --> 02:03:02.442 region:rollup2
BE THE RECIPIENT OF THE WORLD'S

02:03:00.707 --> 02:03:03.977 region:rollup2
GARBAGE ESSENTIALLY.

02:03:02.442 --> 02:03:05.245 region:rollup2
SO NATIONAL SOARED THIS POLICY

02:03:03.977 --> 02:03:06.846 region:rollup2
THAT WAS JUST INTRODUCED IS

02:03:05.245 --> 02:03:09.349 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON A PREVIOUS POLICY

02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:11.718 region:rollup2
THAT WAS CALLED GREEN FENCE.

02:03:09.349 --> 02:03:13.186 region:rollup2
BECAME BORED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN.

02:03:11.718 --> 02:03:14.520 region:rollup2
THAT POLICY SIMILARLY WAS

02:03:13.186 --> 02:03:15.521 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE THE IMPORT

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.190 region:rollup2
OF CONTAMINATED MATERIALS TO

02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:18.625 region:rollup2
CHINA.

02:03:17.190 --> 02:03:19.158 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT THE IMPACTS IN

02:03:18.625 --> 02:03:20.293 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BACK IN TWENTY

02:03:19.158 --> 02:03:21.661 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

02:03:20.293 --> 02:03:23.496 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE WAS BACK

02:03:21.661 --> 02:03:25.164 region:rollup2
UPS THE PORTS AND THAT'S REALLY

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:26.733 region:rollup2
WHEN WE STARTED SEEING A MAJOR

02:03:25.164 --> 02:03:29.669 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN NAM? OUR EXPORTS TO

02:03:26.733 --> 02:03:30.803 region:rollup2
CHINA.

02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:32.438 region:rollup2
GREEN FENCE WAS ULTIMATELY

02:03:30.803 --> 02:03:34.007 region:rollup2
UNSUCCESSFUL IN MEETING CHINA'S

02:03:32.438 --> 02:03:36.376 region:rollup2
GOAL OF. CLEANING UP THE

02:03:34.007 --> 02:03:38.478 region:rollup2
REFINEMENT ENVIRONMENT REDUCING

02:03:36.376 --> 02:03:39.846 region:rollup2
THE IMPORTS OF FOREIGN WASTE.

02:03:38.478 --> 02:03:41.347 region:rollup2
SO AS A RESULT IN PART OF

02:03:39.846 --> 02:03:43.716 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SOARED IN TWENTY

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:44.884 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN NON IN JULY CHINA

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:46.552 region:rollup2
NOTIFIED THE WORLD TRADE

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:47.787 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION OF TWENTY FOUR

02:03:46.552 --> 02:03:49.522 region:rollup2
WASTE THAT THEY WERE BANNED FROM

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:50.823 region:rollup2
IMPORT.

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:52.358 region:rollup2
AND THOSE THAT ARE RELEVANT TO

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:54.127 region:rollup2
OUR DISCUSSION TODAY. ARE MIXED

02:03:52.358 --> 02:03:55.528 region:rollup2
PAPERS AND MIXED PLASTICS

02:03:54.127 --> 02:03:56.062 region:rollup2
BOTH OF WHICH WOULD EXPORT QUITE

02:03:55.528 --> 02:03:58.398 region:rollup2
A BIT TO TO CHINA OVER THE

02:03:56.062 --> 02:04:00.066 region:rollup2
YEARS.

02:03:58.398 --> 02:04:01.467 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE BAND.

02:04:00.066 --> 02:04:02.702 region:rollup2
A POINT FIVE PERCENT

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:04.537 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION RATE WAS

02:04:02.702 --> 02:04:06.472 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL OTHER

02:04:04.537 --> 02:04:08.141 region:rollup2
ALLOWABLE RECYCLABLE IMPORTS.

02:04:06.472 --> 02:04:10.376 region:rollup2
THIS STANDARD IS EXTREMELY HARD

02:04:08.141 --> 02:04:11.678 region:rollup2
TO ME. ON BUYER FACILITIES HERE

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:14.180 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE

02:04:11.678 --> 02:04:15.048 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES.

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.083 region:rollup2
SO WHAT IS POINT FIVE

02:04:15.048 --> 02:04:18.051 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION RATE LOOK LIKE IN

02:04:17.083 --> 02:04:20.119 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE A BALLOT

02:04:18.051 --> 02:04:21.754 region:rollup2
CARDBOARD WHAT CAN BE. A LOT OF

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:23.990 region:rollup2
THINGS FROM LABELS

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:24.824 region:rollup2
TAPE TO BELL WIRE TO SOME OF THE

02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:26.192 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT ARE HARD TO SORT

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:27.860 region:rollup2
OUT OF MATERIAL RECOVERY

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:30.930 region:rollup2
FACILITIES. LIKE FILM PLASTIC

02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:31.731 region:rollup2
AND OTHER THINGS.

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:33.366 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE POINT FIVE

02:04:31.731 --> 02:04:34.734 region:rollup2
PERCENT CONTAMINATION RATE.

02:04:33.366 --> 02:04:36.235 region:rollup2
CHINA ALSO LIMITED IMPORT

02:04:34.734 --> 02:04:37.303 region:rollup2
LICENSES INCREASED INSPECTIONS

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:38.805 region:rollup2
AT THE PORT.

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:39.839 region:rollup2
MAKING IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING

02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:42.108 region:rollup2
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT OUR

02:04:39.839 --> 02:04:43.176 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THERE.

02:04:42.108 --> 02:04:44.711 region:rollup2
SO THESE POLICIES WERE

02:04:43.176 --> 02:04:45.878 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED ON TO CLEAN UP AND

02:04:44.711 --> 02:04:47.447 region:rollup2
PRESERVE CHINA'S ENVIRONMENT AS

02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:49.148 region:rollup2
I'VE MENTIONED.

02:04:47.447 --> 02:04:51.317 region:rollup2
IN OCTOBER IT CHINA'S NINETEENTH

02:04:49.148 --> 02:04:52.952 region:rollup2
ANNUAL CONGRESS PRESIDENT SHE'S

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:54.387 region:rollup2
IN PAIN MENTION THE ENVIRONMENT

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:55.989 region:rollup2
EIGHTY NINE TIMES WHILE ONLY

02:04:54.387 --> 02:05:00.827 region:rollup2
MENTIONING THE ECONOMY SEVENTY

02:04:55.989 --> 02:05:01.861 region:rollup2
TIMES IN HIS SPEECH.

02:05:00.827 --> 02:05:02.995 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THEM

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:04.564 region:rollup2
PACKS OF NATIONAL SORT HERE IN

02:05:02.995 --> 02:05:06.632 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:05:04.564 --> 02:05:08.034 region:rollup2
MARY MATERIALS I NO LONGER HAVE

02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:09.802 region:rollup2
MARKETS ARE STOCKPILING AT OUR

02:05:08.034 --> 02:05:11.070 region:rollup2
SOLID WASTE FACILITIES.

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:12.905 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES MATERIALS THAT

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:15.808 region:rollup2
WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPORTED ARE NOW

02:05:12.905 --> 02:05:17.176 region:rollup2
BEING SENT TO LANDFILL.

02:05:15.808 --> 02:05:18.478 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS HOLLERS AND SOLID

02:05:17.176 --> 02:05:19.746 region:rollup2
WASTE FACILITIES ARE DOING WHAT

02:05:18.478 --> 02:05:20.747 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T RESPOND TO THE

02:05:19.746 --> 02:05:22.382 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH

02:05:20.747 --> 02:05:22.849 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SORT.

02:05:22.382 --> 02:05:24.584 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES LIKE WASTE

02:05:22.849 --> 02:05:26.052 region:rollup2
PREVENTION.

02:05:24.584 --> 02:05:28.221 region:rollup2
UPDATING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS

02:05:26.052 --> 02:05:29.622 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT CAN BE

02:05:28.221 --> 02:05:31.557 region:rollup2
PLACED IN THE BROUGH BEN.

02:05:29.622 --> 02:05:32.959 region:rollup2
INCREASING PROCESSING MATERIALS

02:05:31.557 --> 02:05:34.160 region:rollup2
THAT MATERIAL RECOVERY

02:05:32.959 --> 02:05:36.362 region:rollup2
FACILITIES TOURS REDUCE

02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:38.097 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATION CAN ALL RESULT IN

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:39.699 region:rollup2
CLEANER MATERIAL.

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:41.267 region:rollup2
BUT THE STRATEGIES COSTS A LOT

02:05:39.699 --> 02:05:42.769 region:rollup2
OF MONEY INTO NOT FULLY

02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:44.937 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM WITH OUR

02:05:42.769 --> 02:05:46.572 region:rollup2
RELIANCE ON EXPORTS MARKET.

02:05:44.937 --> 02:05:47.673 region:rollup2
GONNA TURN IT BACK OVER DID CAN

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:48.441 region:rollup2
WHO WILL NOW ADDRESS THE

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:50.109 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING

02:05:48.441 --> 02:05:51.944 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE RECYCLING PROGRAMS

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:54.914 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WEEK BEFORE.

02:05:51.944 --> 02:05:56.716 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHIFT OVER.

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:59.152 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY STATISTICSOR

02:05:56.716 --> 02:06:00.853 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS ON WHAT THE

02:05:59.152 --> 02:06:02.855 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:05.658 region:rollup2
AND RECYCLING FOR VARIOUS

02:06:02.855 --> 02:06:07.493 region:rollup2
MATERIALS WILL BE AS A RESULT OF

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:09.362 region:rollup2
THESE CHANGES. MAY BE YOU KNOW

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:11.164 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWENTY ELEVEN AND.

02:06:09.362 --> 02:06:12.732 region:rollup2
WHEREVER AND WE END UP AT THE

02:06:11.164 --> 02:06:14.033 region:rollup2
END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY

02:06:12.732 --> 02:06:15.768 region:rollup2
NINE SOMETHING.

02:06:14.033 --> 02:06:17.737 region:rollup2
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S

02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:19.806 region:rollup2
HARD TO SAY AT THIS POINT WE

02:06:17.737 --> 02:06:21.808 region:rollup2
STARTED RECEIVING SOME JUST.

02:06:19.806 --> 02:06:23.342 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY DATA ON WHITE ON OUR

02:06:21.808 --> 02:06:24.744 region:rollup2
EXPORTS ARE PROJECTED TO BE OUT

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:26.412 region:rollup2
TO THE.

02:06:24.744 --> 02:06:27.680 region:rollup2
TO THE NEXT YEAR AND IT'S NOT

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:29.015 region:rollup2
LOOKING VERY GOOD FOR MATERIALS

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.550 region:rollup2
LIKE.

02:06:29.015 --> 02:06:32.618 region:rollup2
CARDBOARD IN MIXED PAPER

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:33.886 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY ON SO WE ANTICIPATE

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:34.954 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:36.956 region:rollup2
OUR OVERALL RECYCLING WILL

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:38.724 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DECLINE ON.

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:40.092 region:rollup2
OVER THE NEXT

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:41.594 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL WE HAVE SOME

02:06:40.092 --> 02:06:42.462 region:rollup2
MORE.

02:06:41.594 --> 02:06:43.096 region:rollup2
STABILIZATION IN THE MARKETS

ON.

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:48.401 region:rollup2
WITH THAT SAID WE ARE LOOKING

02:06:46.866 --> 02:06:49.936 region:rollup2
THROUGH SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE

02:06:48.401 --> 02:06:51.938 region:rollup2
AND OTHER MEASURES TO INCREASE

02:06:49.936 --> 02:06:53.573 region:rollup2
ORGANICS RECYCLING. ARM SO IF

02:06:51.938 --> 02:06:55.208 region:rollup2
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT WE

02:06:53.573 --> 02:06:57.643 region:rollup2
MIGHT SEE.

02:06:55.208 --> 02:06:59.846 region:rollup2
SWING EN AN UPSWING IN OUR

02:06:57.643 --> 02:07:01.948 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE. ON ALSO IF WERE

02:06:59.846 --> 02:07:04.484 region:rollup2
ABLE TO FIND SOME SUSTAINABLE

02:07:01.948 --> 02:07:05.785 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES WITH IN CALIFORNIA.

02:07:04.484 --> 02:07:06.886 region:rollup2
WE CAN SEE WE CAN UP TO SEE THAT

02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:08.254 region:rollup2
AS WELL FOR SOME THESE OTHER

02:07:06.886 --> 02:07:09.055 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT WE'VE.

02:07:08.254 --> 02:07:10.656 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY RELIED ON THE

02:07:09.055 --> 02:07:13.259 region:rollup2
EXPERTS MARKET.

02:07:10.656 --> 02:07:15.294 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:07:13.259 --> 02:07:16.562 region:rollup2
SO.

02:07:15.294 --> 02:07:18.631 region:rollup2
WITH MORE MATERIAL STAYING

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:20.099 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MAJOR FLUCTUATIONS IN

02:07:18.631 --> 02:07:21.868 region:rollup2
PRICE AND THAT SORT OF LACK OF A

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:23.102 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS

02:07:21.868 --> 02:07:24.737 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE CLEARLY MORE

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:26.506 region:rollup2
RESILIENT. RECYCLING PROGRAMS

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:27.340 region:rollup2
CLEAN MATERIAL.

02:07:26.506 --> 02:07:28.841 region:rollup2
IN STATE PROCESSING IN

REMANUFACTURING UNSTRUNG

02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:32.011 region:rollup2
DIVERSIFIED MARKETS ARE ARE

02:07:30.343 --> 02:07:33.479 region:rollup2
THOSE CRITICAL COMPONENTS SO IF

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:35.114 region:rollup2
WE CONSIDERED THAT THE BEVERAGE

02:07:33.479 --> 02:07:36.482 region:rollup2
CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM.

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:37.817 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LENS OF THESE

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:38.951 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS A I THINK IT

02:07:37.817 --> 02:07:41.721 region:rollup2
IS SOME OF THESE IDEAS.

02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:43.589 region:rollup2
COME CLEAR FIRST.

02:07:41.721 --> 02:07:44.891 region:rollup2
THE DEPOSIT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:45.958 region:rollup2
THAT FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR

02:07:44.891 --> 02:07:47.994 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:49.095 region:rollup2
TO BRING BACK THAT BEVERAGE

02:07:47.994 --> 02:07:50.630 region:rollup2
CONTAINER TO RECYCLING SAN BRING

02:07:49.095 --> 02:07:51.764 region:rollup2
THAT MATERIAL.

02:07:50.630 --> 02:07:53.399 region:rollup2
THIS ENSURES A CLEANER

02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:55.101 region:rollup2
COLLECTION AND AS A RESULT OF

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:56.168 region:rollup2
HIGHER SCRAP VALUE THAN WHAT'S

02:07:55.101 --> 02:07:58.037 region:rollup2
COLLECTED AT CURBSIDE AND WE'VE

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:58.938 region:rollup2
HEARD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THE

02:07:58.037 --> 02:07:59.939 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY OF THAT THAT

02:07:58.938 --> 02:08:01.274 region:rollup2
MATERIAL IN THE CONCERNS THERE

02:07:59.939 --> 02:08:03.009 region:rollup2
BOTH.

02:08:01.274 --> 02:08:03.509 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF

02:08:03.009 --> 02:08:05.545 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:06.913 region:rollup2
MATERIAL COMING.

02:08:05.545 --> 02:08:08.915 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL PAPER ONE COLLECTED

02:08:06.913 --> 02:08:10.116 region:rollup2
A CURB SIDES EASILY CONTAMINATED

02:08:08.915 --> 02:08:11.083 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE HEARD THROUGH SINGLE

02:08:10.116 --> 02:08:13.419 region:rollup2
STRING COLLECTION PROGRAMS.

02:08:11.083 --> 02:08:15.188 region:rollup2
SECOND.

02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:17.123 region:rollup2
THE PBP PROGRAM SUPPORTS THAT IN

02:08:15.188 --> 02:08:18.391 region:rollup2
STATE REMANUFACTURING CREEK BY

02:08:17.123 --> 02:08:19.792 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THOSE SUBSIDIES TO

02:08:18.391 --> 02:08:21.494 region:rollup2
RECLAIM RISEN MANUFACTURES USE

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:23.329 region:rollup2
RECYCLED PLASTIC OVER VIRGIN

02:08:21.494 --> 02:08:24.764 region:rollup2
MATERIAL. AND TO HELP COMPETE

02:08:23.329 --> 02:08:26.632 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE OVERSEAS MARKETS PART

02:08:24.764 --> 02:08:27.733 region:rollup2
OF PROGRAM STARTING IN FACT WE

02:08:26.632 --> 02:08:29.569 region:rollup2
WERE EXPORTING ABOUT NINETY

02:08:27.733 --> 02:08:31.671 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT OF OF P. ET NOW

02:08:29.569 --> 02:08:32.972 region:rollup2
IT'S ONLY FIFTY PERCENT.

02:08:31.671 --> 02:08:34.607 region:rollup2
LASTLY AND AS YOU'LL RECALL FROM

02:08:32.972 --> 02:08:35.174 region:rollup2
HIS HOWLERS COMMENTS TWO THIRDS

02:08:34.607 --> 02:08:36.542 region:rollup2
MATERIAL GOING INTO THE BLUE

02:08:35.174 --> 02:08:38.144 region:rollup2
BIN.

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:39.612 region:rollup2
IS EXPORTED THAT'S ARTHUR

02:08:38.144 --> 02:08:41.380 region:rollup2
CONCEPT IS CREATING MARKET

02:08:39.612 --> 02:08:42.915 region:rollup2
DEMAND TO POLICIES LIKE PMT P.

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.783 region:rollup2
AND MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT THEY

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:44.850 region:rollup2
CAN HELP BUILD RESILIENT

02:08:43.783 --> 02:08:47.753 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PROGRAMS FOR THOSE

02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:49.288 region:rollup2
MISTER MATERIALS. THAT WE'VE

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:51.157 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY EXPORTED ELSEWHERE.

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:51.958 region:rollup2
SO IF WE HAD SIMILAR PROGRAMS TO

02:08:51.157 --> 02:08:53.693 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER

02:08:51.958 --> 02:08:55.061 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT HAVE TALKED ABOUT

02:08:53.693 --> 02:08:56.229 region:rollup2
WE COULD REDUCE OUR EXPORTS AND

02:08:55.061 --> 02:08:57.363 region:rollup2
BUILD UP OUR DOMESTIC

02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:59.565 region:rollup2
REMANUFACTURING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:08:57.363 --> 02:09:01.400 region:rollup2
AND DIVERSIFIED MARKETS.

02:08:59.565 --> 02:09:02.501 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE JUST LAST YEAR WE

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.135 region:rollup2
EXPORTED FOUR MILLION TONS OF

02:09:02.501 --> 02:09:04.904 region:rollup2
CARDBOARD.

02:09:03.135 --> 02:09:06.505 region:rollup2
THE CHINA.

02:09:04.904 --> 02:09:08.274 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ROBUST DOMESTIC

02:09:06.505 --> 02:09:09.575 region:rollup2
REMANUFACTURING OF MARKETS

02:09:08.274 --> 02:09:11.177 region:rollup2
CARDBOARD WOULD WILL LIKELY BE

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:11.811 region:rollup2
DESTINED FOR DISPOSAL.

02:09:11.177 --> 02:09:13.746 region:rollup2
THE SAME GOES FOR OTHER MATERIAL

02:09:11.811 --> 02:09:14.747 region:rollup2
TYPES.

02:09:13.746 --> 02:09:16.015 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THE

02:09:14.747 --> 02:09:17.516 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SORT IS GOING AWAY

02:09:16.015 --> 02:09:19.285 region:rollup2
ANYTIME SOON.

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:20.620 region:rollup2
COLLECT SORT AN EXPORT IS NO

02:09:19.285 --> 02:09:21.687 region:rollup2
LONGER A VIABLE MATERIALS

02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:23.289 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT STRATEGY HERE IN

02:09:21.687 --> 02:09:23.723 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:09:23.289 --> 02:09:26.158 region:rollup2
THAT SAID WE HAVE AN

02:09:23.723 --> 02:09:27.360 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:28.828 region:rollup2
AND A CHALLENGE TO REDEFINE

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:30.129 region:rollup2
RECYCLING.

02:09:28.828 --> 02:09:31.797 region:rollup2
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT THAT

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:34.233 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR SUCCESSFUL

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:35.868 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR ALL MATERIALS.

02:09:34.233 --> 02:09:37.136 region:rollup2
SO IN IN CLOSING I THINK YOU'VE

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:38.537 region:rollup2
HEARD SOME OF THE CRITICAL AND

02:09:37.136 --> 02:09:40.139 region:rollup2
KEY ELEMENTS HERE THIS IS A

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:41.407 region:rollup2
THIRTY YEAR OLD PROGRAM IT HAS

02:09:40.139 --> 02:09:42.708 region:rollup2
STATUTES THAT ARE THAT ARE

02:09:41.407 --> 02:09:43.843 region:rollup2
RATHER RIGID AND ANDWE HAVE

02:09:42.708 --> 02:09:45.745 region:rollup2
LIMITED FLEXIBILITY TO TO

02:09:43.843 --> 02:09:47.246 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THIS.

02:09:45.745 --> 02:09:49.115 region:rollup2
TOOK TO ACCOMMODATE AT.

02:09:47.246 --> 02:09:50.983 region:rollup2
WE DID AS MR MURRAY RIGHTLY

02:09:49.115 --> 02:09:52.118 region:rollup2
POINTS OUT EXERCISING REGULATORY

02:09:50.983 --> 02:09:54.220 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY.

02:09:52.118 --> 02:09:55.655 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE REASONABLE

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:56.689 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RETURNS.

02:09:55.655 --> 02:09:57.390 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE OPTIONS

02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:58.724 region:rollup2
ELSEWHERE.

02:09:57.390 --> 02:09:59.925 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS IN

02:09:58.724 --> 02:10:01.193 region:rollup2
TERMS OF HOW WE ESTABLISH

02:09:59.925 --> 02:10:02.962 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS REQUIRE A LOOK BACK

02:10:01.193 --> 02:10:04.230 region:rollup2
THAT IT THAT IS NOT CONTEMPORARY

02:10:02.962 --> 02:10:04.864 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT'S EXACTLY HAPPENING

02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:07.066 region:rollup2
WITH THE MARKET.

02:10:04.864 --> 02:10:07.933 region:rollup2
.

02:10:07.066 --> 02:10:09.402 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NEED TO LOOK AT

02:10:07.933 --> 02:10:09.969 region:rollup2
CONVENIENCE BASED ON THE UNIQUE

02:10:09.402 --> 02:10:11.537 region:rollup2
REGIONS.

02:10:09.969 --> 02:10:12.805 region:rollup2
WITHIN CALIFORNIAN THAT COULD

02:10:11.537 --> 02:10:14.106 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR APPROACHES THAT A MORE

02:10:12.805 --> 02:10:15.508 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:16.676 region:rollup2
TO ASK BEFORE FIFTY EIGHT WHICH

02:10:15.508 --> 02:10:17.643 region:rollup2
WE'RE IMPLEMENTING NOW WILL

02:10:16.676 --> 02:10:18.778 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO EXPLORE SOME PILOT

02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:20.846 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:10:18.778 --> 02:10:21.614 region:rollup2
ON CONVENIENCE IN COLLECTION

02:10:20.846 --> 02:10:23.382 region:rollup2
MODELS.

02:10:21.614 --> 02:10:25.384 region:rollup2
WERE CONDUCTING WORKSHOPS RIGHT

02:10:23.382 --> 02:10:27.053 region:rollup2
NOW ON THAT TO TO GARNER SOME

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:28.354 region:rollup2
INTERESTING IDEAS AND AND WILL

02:10:27.053 --> 02:10:29.922 region:rollup2
BEGIN MOVING THAT FORWARD OVER

02:10:28.354 --> 02:10:30.523 region:rollup2
THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE

02:10:29.922 --> 02:10:31.424 region:rollup2
YEARS WHERE WE CAN LEARN FROM

02:10:30.523 --> 02:10:34.026 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:10:31.424 --> 02:10:34.560 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK YOU TO

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.728 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN MARKETS HAVE TO BE

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:38.297 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED.

02:10:35.728 --> 02:10:39.231 region:rollup2
MINIMUM RECYCLE CONTENT IS ONE

02:10:38.297 --> 02:10:41.067 region:rollup2
WAY GETTING US THERE RISK

02:10:39.231 --> 02:10:41.867 region:rollup2
REQUIRING CONTAINERS TO INCLUDE

02:10:41.067 --> 02:10:43.569 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:45.371 region:rollup2
MATERIAL PROVIDES A CONSISTENT

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:45.805 region:rollup2
MARKET DEMAND IS MORE INSULATED

02:10:45.371 --> 02:10:47.139 region:rollup2
FROM INTERNAL MARKET

02:10:45.805 --> 02:10:48.574 region:rollup2
FLUCTUATIONS.

02:10:47.139 --> 02:10:49.775 region:rollup2
MORE BROADLY IN ORDER TO CREATE

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:51.610 region:rollup2

CLOSED LOOP RECYCLING.

02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:54.180 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF OPTIONS OUR

02:10:52.712 --> 02:10:55.648 region:rollup2
PURSES TO DEVELOP DOWNSTREAM

02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:57.116 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS LIKE THE

02:10:55.648 --> 02:10:58.451 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. PROGRAM TO

DIVERSIFIED MARKETS

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.021 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WE CAN LOOK

02:11:00.653 --> 02:11:03.789 region:rollup2
UPSTREAM TEA IS LESS MATERIALS

02:11:02.021 --> 02:11:05.558 region:rollup2
MAKE SMARTER CHOICES ON THE

MATERIALS THAT WE DO USE.

02:11:05.558 --> 02:11:09.328 region:rollup2
I'M A CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE

RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING THAT.

02:11:13.999 --> 02:11:17.837 region:rollup2
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

02:11:15.601 --> 02:11:18.904 region:rollup2
LEFT WITH THE HARD DECISIONS TO

02:11:17.837 --> 02:11:20.606 region:rollup2
MANAGE THESE MATERIALS THAT CAN

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:21.273 region:rollup2
BE DIFFICULT TO COLLECT AND

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:23.743 region:rollup2
REGRETTABLY WILL END UP IN THE

MODERNIZING THE PROGRAM. ONE OF

02:12:21.267 --> 02:12:24.436 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOL BOX IS

02:12:22.535 --> 02:12:25.805 region:rollup2
WHAT IS COMMONLY DONE IN AND

WE HAVE VERY ADVANCED DEPOSITS

02:12:28.707 --> 02:12:32.478 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WHICH IS GREATER USE OF

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:33.379 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY SPECIFICALLY REVERSE

02:12:32.478 --> 02:12:35.314 region:rollup2
VENDING MACHINES.

WE SAW SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF WHAT

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:39.552 region:rollup2
IS BEING DONE IN OREGON.

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:41.353 region:rollup2
HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THIS IS NOT A

02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:42.221 region:rollup2
NEW CONCEPT AT ALL VERY COMMONLY

02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:44.123 region:rollup2

MY ONLY COMMENT HERE IS THAT

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:49.695 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO

02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:51.397 region:rollup2

CLEARING AWAY SOME OF THE RULES

02:12:53.699 --> 02:12:56.869 region:rollup2

02:12:55.668 --> 02:12:58.504 region:rollup2
REALLY PRECLUDE THEIR USE IN

02:12:56.869 --> 02:12:59.605 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALTHOUGH WE DO HAVE

02:12:58.504 --> 02:13:00.940 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED.

02:12:59.605 --> 02:13:02.775 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE THAT.

02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:03.476 region:rollup2
WE COULD USE A LOT MORE THAT

02:13:02.775 --> 02:13:05.945 region:rollup2
WOULD ADDRESS MANY THE ISSUES IN

02:13:03.476 --> 02:13:07.613 region:rollup2
THE. RURAL AREAS IN URBAN AREAS

02:13:05.945 --> 02:13:09.281 region:rollup2

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:12.184 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT DO PROVIDE. NOT

ONLY A.

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:15.287 region:rollup2
MECHANISM FOR DEBATE.

02:13:13.219 --> 02:13:18.157 region:rollup2
FOR REDEMPTION BUT ACTUALLY A

02:13:15.287 --> 02:13:19.325 region:rollup2
TRUE PAYMENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL

02:13:18.157 --> 02:13:21.160 region:rollup2

02:13:19.325 --> 02:13:22.394 region:rollup2
PER BOTTLE AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.929 region:rollup2
WEIGHT IN WHICH THAT NORMALLY

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:25.631 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER WILL GET SHORT

02:13:23.929 --> 02:13:27.333 region:rollup2
CHANGED SOME DEGREE. BY BRINGING

02:13:25.631 --> 02:13:27.867 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL BY WEIGHT AND WITH

02:13:27.333 --> 02:13:29.969 region:rollup2
THOSE COMMENTS WE LOOK FOR

02:13:27.867 --> 02:13:30.569 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH STAFF AND

02:13:29.969 --> 02:13:33.372 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TO SORT THIS OUT

WE TAKE THOSE WE STERILIZE AND

02:13:53.893 --> 02:13:56.195 region:rollup2
TURN THEM INTO A PRODUCT BE MADE

02:13:55.628 --> 02:13:57.162 region:rollup2

LINE.

02:13:57.162 --> 02:14:00.165 region:rollup2
BEFORE IT BECOMES SOMETHING NEW

02:13:58.397 --> 02:14:01.467 region:rollup2
AGAIN SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:02.968 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE BEEN

02:14:01.467 --> 02:14:04.770 region:rollup2

THE GAP THAT WE NEED BEFORE OUR

02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:28.360 region:rollup2
GUYS LITERALLY GO UNDER IF WE

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:29.295 region:rollup2

CLOSELY.

02:14:39.305 --> 02:14:42.074 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M

VERY BRIEF WHITE PAPER THAT WE

02:14:49.515 --> 02:14:52.518 region:rollup2
OF NATIONAL SOARED.

PLEASED TO SEE THAT.

02:14:58.591 --> 02:15:01.727 region:rollup2
WE ARE DISCUSSING THE VAT

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:03.696 region:rollup2
ALONGSIDE THE MATTRESS IN THE

02:15:01.727 --> 02:15:04.997 region:rollup2
BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM ISSUE.

02:15:03.696 --> 02:15:06.231 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE EXACT NUMBERS IN

02:15:04.997 --> 02:15:07.366 region:rollup2
MIND BUT I'M GUESSING OF THE

02:15:06.231 --> 02:15:09.668 region:rollup2
THIRTY SWEET.

02:15:07.366 --> 02:15:11.537 region:rollup2
DISPOSE OF SOME THIRTY SEVEN

02:15:09.668 --> 02:15:11.937 region:rollup2
MILLION TONS OF MATERIAL EVERY

02:15:11.537 --> 02:15:13.706 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:15.307 region:rollup2
WHILE THE BOTTLE BILL FIXES ARE

02:15:13.706 --> 02:15:16.375 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

02:15:15.307 --> 02:15:17.776 region:rollup2
AND WE CAN PERHAPS AGREE ON SOME

02:15:16.375 --> 02:15:19.645 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE OUGHT TO BE A MUCH

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:20.245 region:rollup2
LARGER PROBLEM IS LOOMING AND

02:15:19.645 --> 02:15:22.781 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE PROBLEM OF NATIONAL

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:23.782 region:rollup2
SOARED.

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:25.050 region:rollup2
THE MEMBERS OF C. R. SEE ARE THE

02:15:23.782 --> 02:15:26.819 region:rollup2
MURPH OPERATORS OF FOLKS WHO

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:28.454 region:rollup2
BUILT FINANCE CONSTRUCTED THESE

02:15:26.819 --> 02:15:29.688 region:rollup2
OF FACILITIES AND FEED THEM

02:15:28.454 --> 02:15:31.156 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COLLECTION SYSTEM

02:15:29.688 --> 02:15:32.358 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH.

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:34.059 region:rollup2
THEY LITERALLY ARE FINDING NO

02:15:32.358 --> 02:15:35.394 region:rollup2
HOME.

02:15:34.059 --> 02:15:37.396 region:rollup2
FOR A GREAT DEAL OF MATERIAL

02:15:35.394 --> 02:15:40.466 region:rollup2
THAT FORMALLY HAD A HOME. IN THE

02:15:37.396 --> 02:15:40.1000 region:rollup2
CITY THE LAW IS NOT CURRENTLY.

02:15:40.466 --> 02:15:43.035 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIVE IN THE WAY TO

02:15:40.1000 --> 02:15:44.336 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT THE ASSUMPTION THAT

02:15:43.035 --> 02:15:45.771 region:rollup2
WAS MADE WITH NINE THIRTY NINE

02:15:44.336 --> 02:15:47.373 region:rollup2
WAS IT MARKETS WOULD ALWAYS BE

02:15:45.771 --> 02:15:49.274 region:rollup2
THERE THE SUDDEN. AND PROFOUND

02:15:47.373 --> 02:15:51.176 region:rollup2
CRASH IN THOSE MARKETS MEANS

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:52.378 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN. THERE'S A CLASS OF

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:54.046 region:rollup2
MATERIAL WE CAN'T EVEN PAY TO

02:15:52.378 --> 02:15:55.447 region:rollup2
GET RID OF.

02:15:54.046 --> 02:15:56.615 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE SOLUTION

02:15:55.447 --> 02:15:58.851 region:rollup2
IS BUT IT'S A VERY SHORT TERM

02:15:56.615 --> 02:16:00.586 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE PROBLEM I'D LOVE ONE

02:15:58.851 --> 02:16:01.253 region:rollup2
DAY FOR THERE TO BE A RESILIENT.

DESCRIBED.

02:16:02.788 --> 02:16:05.791 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF DOMESTIC

ACCEPT MATERIAL FROM US AND

02:22:42.421 --> 02:22:46.658 region:rollup2
I'M ABOUT THE. RATE OF RECYCLING

02:22:44.523 --> 02:22:48.627 region:rollup2
FOR GLASSON AND UNFORTUNATELY HE

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:49.661 region:rollup2
LAUGHED I'M I THINK ALL THE

02:22:48.627 --> 02:22:51.163 region:rollup2
ANSWERS THAT WERE GIVEN TO ON

02:22:49.661 --> 02:22:53.932 region:rollup2
THAT THE OTHER MATERIAL TYPES

02:22:51.163 --> 02:22:56.101 region:rollup2
ARE ARE WIDER EASIER TO MOVE ALL

02:22:53.932 --> 02:22:56.935 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ALL. ACCURATE ACCURATE

02:22:56.101 --> 02:22:59.304 region:rollup2
A.

02:22:56.935 --> 02:23:00.672 region:rollup2
RESPONSES IT'S BUT IT'S ON.

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:02.741 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S SOMETHING TO

02:23:00.672 --> 02:23:04.576 region:rollup2
BE SAID THAT AT ONE POINT AND IT

02:23:02.741 --> 02:23:06.178 region:rollup2
WAS IT WAS MENTIONED BY SOMEBODY

02:23:04.576 --> 02:23:08.146 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU KNOW THE THE ROOM THE

02:23:06.178 --> 02:23:09.981 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE FOR ALUMINUM WAS

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:12.050 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ABOUT A HUNDRED PERCENT

02:23:09.981 --> 02:23:13.351 region:rollup2
AT ONE POINT SO SO YOU KNOW IF

02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:15.253 region:rollup2
YOU GET TO TAKE SOME THIS

02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:17.255 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE STAFF IN. PUT IT

02:23:15.253 --> 02:23:19.357 region:rollup2
INTO IN A BIGGER CONTEXT

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:19.658 region:rollup2
ANYTHING MISTER DRAWS A HIT ON

02:23:19.357 --> 02:23:20.759 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT.

02:23:19.658 --> 02:23:22.461 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A PRETTY

02:23:20.759 --> 02:23:24.496 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB IN LAST YEAR'S OF

02:23:22.461 --> 02:23:25.530 region:rollup2
RATCHETING DOWN ON FRAUD IN SO

02:23:24.496 --> 02:23:26.598 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:28.333 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

02:23:26.598 --> 02:23:29.701 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATE FOR WOMEN TO HAVE

02:23:28.333 --> 02:23:31.002 region:rollup2
EVER BEEN A FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT

02:23:29.701 --> 02:23:32.737 region:rollup2
BUT IT WAS.

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:35.106 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY THEY'VE DONE A GOOD

02:23:32.737 --> 02:23:36.708 region:rollup2
JOB OF TAKING A MATERIAL LIKE

02:23:35.106 --> 02:23:38.910 region:rollup2
PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM WHICH ARE

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:40.846 region:rollup2
VERY LIGHT EASY TO MOVE ACROSS

02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:41.913 region:rollup2
STATE LINES AND BRING IN THE

02:23:40.846 --> 02:23:43.682 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIAN RECYCLE IT.

02:23:41.913 --> 02:23:44.983 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE IN ARIZONA OR WHATNOT.

02:23:43.682 --> 02:23:47.385 region:rollup2
YOU KNOWN SURPRISINGLY NOW

02:23:44.983 --> 02:23:49.187 region:rollup2
OREGON HAS A TEN CENT DEPOSIT.

02:23:47.385 --> 02:23:50.522 region:rollup2
SO. YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS MAYBE

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:52.257 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT SOME OF OUR ALL

02:23:50.522 --> 02:23:53.558 region:rollup2
THIS MATERIAL COULD BE MOVING

02:23:52.257 --> 02:23:54.993 region:rollup2
ORGAN FOR ALL WE KNOW IT AGAIN

02:23:53.558 --> 02:23:56.528 region:rollup2
THE TIME INSTEAD OF A NICKEL.

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:57.796 region:rollup2
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP

02:23:56.528 --> 02:23:59.264 region:rollup2
IN MIND AND.

02:23:57.796 --> 02:24:01.800 region:rollup2
AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

02:23:59.264 --> 02:24:03.135 region:rollup2
KNOW RECYCLING RATES.

02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:05.036 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REFLECT LIKE MR GROWTH

02:24:03.135 --> 02:24:08.940 region:rollup2

THEM ITEMS TOOK THANK YOU.

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:11.443 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN A SIMILAR

02:24:09.875 --> 02:24:12.210 region:rollup2
PATTERSON JUST WANTED TO THANK

02:24:11.443 --> 02:24:13.979 region:rollup2
YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING

02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:15.447 region:rollup2
TODAY I THOUGHT SET A VERY GOOD

02:24:13.979 --> 02:24:17.249 region:rollup2
START ANYMORE REPRESENTING REPLY

02:24:15.447 --> 02:24:18.016 region:rollup2
THAT. THE LARGEST CAN BE IT'S AN

02:24:17.249 --> 02:24:19.084 region:rollup2
RECYCLING THE STATE.

02:24:18.016 --> 02:24:21.119 region:rollup2
I THINK THE HEARING SET A

02:24:19.084 --> 02:24:22.220 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL BASS LINE IN TERMS OF

02:24:21.119 --> 02:24:23.855 region:rollup2
OUR HAVING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:25.290 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND WHERE WE'RE STARTING

02:24:23.855 --> 02:24:26.558 region:rollup2
OFF AT THIS POINT IN TIME. OUT

02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:27.626 region:rollup2
AND THEN JUST TWO QUICK POINTS

02:24:26.558 --> 02:24:28.960 region:rollup2
ONE ON THE RECYCLING

02:24:27.626 --> 02:24:31.229 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE.

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:33.398 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER GENERALLY.

02:24:31.229 --> 02:24:35.133 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE PRICE OF

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:36.134 region:rollup2
COMMODITIES IN THE STATE. ON THE

02:24:35.133 --> 02:24:37.802 region:rollup2
FIRST POINT.

02:24:36.134 --> 02:24:39.337 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE HEARD AGAIN AND AGAIN

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:42.040 region:rollup2
ARE RECYCLERS WERE NOT.

02:24:39.337 --> 02:24:43.708 region:rollup2
BUT PROPERLY COMPENSATED FOR

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:45.510 region:rollup2
THE TREMENDOUS DEBT BEEN

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:47.078 region:rollup2
COMMODITIES PRICES. AND ONE OF

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:48.813 region:rollup2
THE REASONS FOR THAT IS IN OUR

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:50.615 region:rollup2
STATES PROGRAM WE PROBABLY DON'T

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:53.485 region:rollup2
ADEQUATELY TIE THE PRICE OF

02:24:50.615 --> 02:24:54.152 region:rollup2
COMMODITIES TO HOW RECYCLERS ARE

02:24:53.485 --> 02:24:55.353 region:rollup2
COMPENSATED.

02:24:54.152 --> 02:24:56.655 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD WHAT MR MURRAY SAY

02:24:55.353 --> 02:24:59.624 region:rollup2
EARLIER THAT.

02:24:56.655 --> 02:25:00.959 region:rollup2
RECYCLERS ARE ARE OFTEN REALLY

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:03.662 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY COMPENSATED.

02:25:00.959 --> 02:25:04.596 region:rollup2
BASED ON THEIR OWN COSTS WHICH

02:25:03.662 --> 02:25:06.298 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE THIS

02:25:04.596 --> 02:25:07.465 region:rollup2
MODERNIZE PROGRAM WE WANT TO

02:25:06.298 --> 02:25:09.167 region:rollup2
THANK THE DEPARTMENT.

02:25:07.465 --> 02:25:11.169 region:rollup2
FOR RECOGNIZING THAT.

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:12.804 region:rollup2
THIS FALL AND ACTING VERY

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:14.105 region:rollup2
QUICKLY TO REMEDY THAT SITUATION

02:25:12.804 --> 02:25:15.173 region:rollup2
AND HELP MAINTAIN OUR EXISTING

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:18.310 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:25:15.173 --> 02:25:18.944 region:rollup2
THE SECOND POINT IS ON THAT THAT

02:25:18.310 --> 02:25:21.346 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:25:18.944 --> 02:25:23.315 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT IS.

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:26.017 region:rollup2
WE IN THE STATE.

02:25:23.315 --> 02:25:27.485 region:rollup2
I HAVE LOST A TON OF THAT THAT

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:28.453 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:30.088 region:rollup2
REINVEST IN THAT.

02:25:28.453 --> 02:25:31.656 region:rollup2
WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:33.058 region:rollup2
COURSE OF OUR CURB SIDE PROGRAMS

02:25:31.656 --> 02:25:35.327 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A VERY CONVENIENT

02:25:33.058 --> 02:25:37.228 region:rollup2
OPTION. ON FOR MANY CONSUMERS

02:25:35.327 --> 02:25:39.931 region:rollup2
BUT FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:41.933 region:rollup2
PAID A NICKEL OR A DIME.

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:43.168 region:rollup2
FOR A CONTAINER AND THEY WANT TO

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:44.736 region:rollup2
GET THAT MONEY BACK.

02:25:43.168 --> 02:25:47.172 region:rollup2
IF THEY DON'T HAVE A CONVENIENT

02:25:44.736 --> 02:25:47.973 region:rollup2
PLACE TO COMPETE IN PLACE TO GO

02:25:47.172 --> 02:25:49.140 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT MONEY BACK IT

02:25:47.973 --> 02:25:50.809 region:rollup2
CONSTITUTES A TAX FOR THOSE

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:52.310 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS. AND THAT'S WHY WE

02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:53.745 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:56.047 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S WHY WE

02:25:53.745 --> 02:25:57.649 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ENCOURAGE OR EVEN

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:58.917 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE.

02:25:57.649 --> 02:26:00.552 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT TO

02:25:58.917 --> 02:26:02.053 region:rollup2
CLOSE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND

02:26:00.552 --> 02:26:03.154 region:rollup2
ONE LAST QUICK POINT IF I MIGHT

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:05.090 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE PRICE OF

02:26:03.154 --> 02:26:06.558 region:rollup2
COMMODITIES AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY

02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:08.326 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM IS NOW PRIMARILY

02:26:06.558 --> 02:26:10.228 region:rollup2
PLASTIC.

02:26:08.326 --> 02:26:12.397 region:rollup2
AND IN ORDER TO INCENTIVIZE A

02:26:10.228 --> 02:26:14.199 region:rollup2
HIGH COMMODITIES PRICES SO THE

02:26:12.397 --> 02:26:16.835 region:rollup2
PROGRAM PAYS ALL OF US A LOT

02:26:14.199 --> 02:26:17.969 region:rollup2
LAST FOR THE COST OF RECYCLING

02:26:16.835 --> 02:26:19.838 region:rollup2
AND SO CONSUMERS ULTIMATELY PAY

02:26:17.969 --> 02:26:21.473 region:rollup2
LESS FOR THAT COST OF RECYCLING.

02:26:19.838 --> 02:26:23.241 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO SUPPORT OUR PLASTIC

02:26:21.473 --> 02:26:25.977 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE

02:26:23.241 --> 02:26:26.544 region:rollup2
CAN DO THAT WAS WITH PLASTIC

02:26:25.977 --> 02:26:30.782 region:rollup2
MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:32.183 region:rollup2

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:19.124 region:rollup2
YOU'VE SPARKED THE DISCUSSION

02:28:17.856 --> 02:28:21.860 region:rollup2
HER DIALOGUE AMONGST US

02:28:19.124 --> 02:28:25.463 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TOGETHER

02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:26.197 region:rollup2
TO UP MAKE SOME OF THE TWEAKS

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:27.699 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS.

02:28:26.197 --> 02:28:29.400 region:rollup2
ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO SOME OF

02:28:27.699 --> 02:28:32.070 region:rollup2
THE METRICS YOU'VE HEARD A LOT

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:32.637 region:rollup2
OF TESTIMONY TODAY A LOT OF

02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:34.172 region:rollup2
NUMBERS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO

02:28:32.637 --> 02:28:37.242 region:rollup2
SAY.

02:28:34.172 --> 02:28:39.277 region:rollup2
THAT OUR RECYCLING RATE IS

02:28:37.242 --> 02:28:40.278 region:rollup2
HOVERING IN THE EIGHTY PERCENT

02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:41.613 region:rollup2
LEVEL. WHEN I LOOKED AT THE

02:28:40.278 --> 02:28:44.149 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT'S QUARTERLY REPORT

02:28:41.613 --> 02:28:47.051 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT YESTERDAY THEY HAD

02:28:44.149 --> 02:28:49.988 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTY POINT SEVEN PERCENT.

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:52.123 region:rollup2
AND THE LOOK IN AND THE LA OWE A

02:28:49.988 --> 02:28:54.659 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT WAS GIVEN OUT THIS

02:28:52.123 --> 02:28:56.361 region:rollup2
MORNING. IT WAS I THINK THE

02:28:54.659 --> 02:28:59.297 region:rollup2
QUOTE WAS ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT

02:28:56.361 --> 02:29:01.132 region:rollup2
CHAU YES WE ARE BELOW THE ALL

02:28:59.297 --> 02:29:03.168 region:rollup2
TIME HISTORIC HIGHS.

02:29:01.132 --> 02:29:05.670 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT MAY BE ATTRIBUTED

02:29:03.168 --> 02:29:08.139 region:rollup2
TO A CONTRACTION OF RECYCLING

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:11.843 region:rollup2
CENTERS SOME OF IT MAY BE

02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:14.078 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTED TO. OF IT MORE GLOBAL

02:29:11.843 --> 02:29:15.480 region:rollup2
A ELEMENTS LIKE PEOPLE BEING

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:18.082 region:rollup2
MORE FLUENT DURING THIS CURRENT

02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:19.384 region:rollup2
TIME SO. WE NEED TO EVALUATE

02:29:18.082 --> 02:29:20.351 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:29:19.384 --> 02:29:23.188 region:rollup2
VERY CRITICALLY

02:29:20.351 --> 02:29:25.723 region:rollup2
UP IF I MIGHT I'D ALSO LIKE TO

02:29:23.188 --> 02:29:27.492 region:rollup2
DISCUSS THE OF THE RECYCLING

02:29:25.723 --> 02:29:28.326 region:rollup2
CENTERS

02:29:27.492 --> 02:29:29.994 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S.

02:29:28.326 --> 02:29:31.162 region:rollup2
IN IMPORTANT POINT AND I DON'T

02:29:29.994 --> 02:29:32.897 region:rollup2
WANNA.

02:29:31.162 --> 02:29:34.933 region:rollup2
SHE JUST THAT THERE ARE TOO FEW

02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:37.802 region:rollup2
OR TOO MANY BUT IT'S VERY

02:29:34.933 --> 02:29:39.804 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED AND IT'S A BALANCE

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:42.440 region:rollup2
IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN. WHAT THE

02:29:39.804 --> 02:29:44.609 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WANTS AND DEMANDS AND

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:46.578 region:rollup2
BETWEEN WHAT THE PROGRAM CAN'T

02:29:44.609 --> 02:29:49.814 region:rollup2
AFFORD? A HUB COUPLE OF YEARS

02:29:46.578 --> 02:29:51.249 region:rollup2
AGO THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:53.485 region:rollup2
BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION

02:29:51.249 --> 02:29:55.620 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONED A STATEWIDE POLL.

02:29:53.485 --> 02:29:58.056 region:rollup2
ACTUAL INTERVIEWS A PRIOR TO

02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:59.824 region:rollup2
GOING OUT IN THE FIELD WE HAD

02:29:58.056 --> 02:30:03.127 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMAN THEN ASSEMBLYMAN

02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:05.396 region:rollup2
RICH GORDON VET THE QUESTIONS TO

02:30:03.127 --> 02:30:06.764 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THEY WERE FAIR AND

02:30:05.396 --> 02:30:09.400 region:rollup2
NOT SKEWED.

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:11.169 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF THE PRIME COMPONENTS

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:12.937 region:rollup2
OF THAT PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY

02:30:11.169 --> 02:30:15.306 region:rollup2
WAS.

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:17.775 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT GENERAL PUBLIC

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:19.410 region:rollup2
WANT AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THERE

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:21.079 region:rollup2
WERE TWENTY TWO PERCENT OF THE

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:23.815 region:rollup2
PEOPLE?

02:30:21.079 --> 02:30:24.315 region:rollup2
WHO FREQUENTLY USED RECYCLING

02:30:23.815 --> 02:30:27.218 region:rollup2
CENTERS AND ABOUT ELEVEN

02:30:24.315 --> 02:30:29.287 region:rollup2
PERCENT?

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:31.122 region:rollup2
THAT OCCASIONALLY.

02:30:29.287 --> 02:30:33.691 region:rollup2
WE THEN ASKED THE QUESTION A

02:30:31.122 --> 02:30:35.293 region:rollup2
BALLOT CURBSIDE AND AS I

02:30:33.691 --> 02:30:37.562 region:rollup2
RECOLLECT THE NUMBERS WHICH HAVE

02:30:35.293 --> 02:30:38.563 region:rollup2
BEEN SHARED WITH CAL RECYCLE THE

02:30:37.562 --> 02:30:39.998 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE POLICY

02:30:38.563 --> 02:30:42.433 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT.

02:30:39.998 --> 02:30:44.369 region:rollup2
THE CURBSIDE.

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:46.104 region:rollup2
ROUGH FRENCH WAS SOMEWHERE IN

02:30:44.369 --> 02:30:48.673 region:rollup2
THE THIRTY SEVEN TO THIRTY EIGHT

02:30:46.104 --> 02:30:51.476 region:rollup2
PERCENT FREQUENT. AND AN

02:30:48.673 --> 02:30:54.746 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO PERCENT.

02:30:51.476 --> 02:30:57.015 region:rollup2
OCCASIONALLY SO IT IT IT IS A

02:30:54.746 --> 02:30:58.583 region:rollup2
MATTER OF CONSUMER CHOICE QUITE

02:30:57.015 --> 02:31:01.686 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY WHETHER THEY WANT TO

02:30:58.583 --> 02:31:03.354 region:rollup2
DONATE OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO

02:31:01.686 --> 02:31:05.189 region:rollup2
RETRIEVE THEIR NICKEL AND AGAIN

02:31:03.354 --> 02:31:07.592 region:rollup2
I'M NOT ARGUING FOR ONE OR THE

02:31:05.189 --> 02:31:10.662 region:rollup2
OTHER. BUT CLEARLY THEY HAVE TO

02:31:07.592 --> 02:31:13.298 region:rollup2
BE A TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. A ALSO

02:31:10.662 --> 02:31:16.301 region:rollup2
CAL RECYCLE IS DOING ITS.

02:31:13.298 --> 02:31:19.070 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE THE UC STUDY THAT

02:31:16.301 --> 02:31:21.005 region:rollup2
CAN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DUE

02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:23.141 region:rollup2
IN AUGUST.

02:31:21.005 --> 02:31:26.544 region:rollup2
WE'RE STILL AWAITING THAT THAT

02:31:23.141 --> 02:31:28.613 region:rollup2
ALSO INCLUDES SOME SURVEY DATA

02:31:26.544 --> 02:31:32.083 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY IT WILL VALIDATE. WHAT

02:31:28.613 --> 02:31:33.885 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A GENERATED UGH JUST TOP

02:31:32.083 --> 02:31:36.321 region:rollup2
LINE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS?

02:31:33.885 --> 02:31:37.956 region:rollup2
MARK MURRAY HAS AND OTHERS HAD

02:31:36.321 --> 02:31:39.857 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE PLASTIC MARKET

02:31:37.956 --> 02:31:42.994 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT. OF MY

02:31:39.857 --> 02:31:44.829 region:rollup2
CLIENTS TOTALLY ENDORSE THAT.

02:31:42.994 --> 02:31:45.363 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKE TO EVEN

02:31:44.829 --> 02:31:47.332 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT RATHER THAN A

02:31:45.363 --> 02:31:49.601 region:rollup2
STATIC.

02:31:47.332 --> 02:31:52.170 region:rollup2
PM DE.

02:31:49.601 --> 02:31:54.906 region:rollup2
HOW BOUT A DYNAMIC PMD

02:31:52.170 --> 02:31:56.374 region:rollup2
SO WHEN THE COST OF VIRGIN AND

02:31:54.906 --> 02:31:59.210 region:rollup2
OR PET?

02:31:56.374 --> 02:32:01.212 region:rollup2
ARE CLOSE TOGETHER.

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:03.348 region:rollup2
THE RECLAIMER SHE WOULD RECEIVE

02:32:01.212 --> 02:32:05.216 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PSALMS BEYOND THAT

02:32:03.348 --> 02:32:07.418 region:rollup2
TEN MILLION MAYBE HAVE IT

02:32:05.216 --> 02:32:09.687 region:rollup2
ELASTIC WORK COULD BE UP TO

02:32:07.418 --> 02:32:12.223 region:rollup2
TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION.

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:14.826 region:rollup2
TO ADJUST FOR THAT GAP.

02:32:12.223 --> 02:32:17.695 region:rollup2
CONVERSELY WHEN THE PRICE OF

02:32:14.826 --> 02:32:20.131 region:rollup2
VIRGIN AND OUR PET ARE.

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:21.232 region:rollup2
QUITE DIFFERENT MAYBE AS THEY

02:32:20.131 --> 02:32:23.368 region:rollup2
ARE TODAY.

02:32:21.232 --> 02:32:25.203 region:rollup2
YOU GO DOWN TO A MUCH LESSER

02:32:23.368 --> 02:32:28.473 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF THEIR WAYS TO HELP.

02:32:25.203 --> 02:32:29.607 region:rollup2
OF RECYCLING CENTERS ARE.

02:32:28.473 --> 02:32:31.476 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT

02:32:29.607 --> 02:32:33.511 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:32:31.476 --> 02:32:35.513 region:rollup2
ABOUT ONE TO DEPARTMENT ADOPTED

02:32:33.511 --> 02:32:37.215 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IN

02:32:35.513 --> 02:32:38.816 region:rollup2
DECEMBER COUNT AS I RECOLLECT.

02:32:37.215 --> 02:32:40.651 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:32:38.816 --> 02:32:41.886 region:rollup2
CHANGERS THE REASONABLE

02:32:40.651 --> 02:32:43.921 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RETURNS.

02:32:41.886 --> 02:32:46.090 region:rollup2
AND.

02:32:43.921 --> 02:32:47.592 region:rollup2
PLUGS INTO A NUMBER OF ELEVEN

02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:50.461 region:rollup2
POINT FIVE PERCENT.

02:32:47.592 --> 02:32:51.963 region:rollup2
FOR URBAN AND SIXTEEN POINT

02:32:50.461 --> 02:32:54.165 region:rollup2
EIGHT OR SOMETHING PERCENT

02:32:51.963 --> 02:32:55.066 region:rollup2
REASONABLE FINANCIAL RETURN FOR

02:32:54.165 --> 02:32:57.301 region:rollup2
RURAL LOCATIONS.

02:32:55.066 --> 02:32:58.803 region:rollup2
OF.

02:32:57.301 --> 02:33:00.772 region:rollup2
MY CLIENTS SUPPOSED THAT NOT

02:32:58.803 --> 02:33:03.007 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER WHICH

02:33:00.772 --> 02:33:04.809 region:rollup2
ARGUABLY WAS SOMEWHAT ARBITRARY

02:33:03.007 --> 02:33:07.578 region:rollup2
AND NOT TIED TO ANYTHING

02:33:04.809 --> 02:33:08.046 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC BUT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T

02:33:07.578 --> 02:33:09.681 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE A

02:33:08.046 --> 02:33:11.716 region:rollup2
COMPONENT.

02:33:09.681 --> 02:33:14.252 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND THE REDEMPTION

02:33:11.716 --> 02:33:15.153 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WAS A FOCUS

02:33:14.252 --> 02:33:18.690 region:rollup2
OF THIS.

02:33:15.153 --> 02:33:20.358 region:rollup2
HEARING EARLIER SHOW I THINK WE

02:33:18.690 --> 02:33:22.527 region:rollup2
MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY THERE BUT.

02:33:20.358 --> 02:33:25.530 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF WE NEED A MORE

02:33:22.527 --> 02:33:27.532 region:rollup2
ROBUST CENTER TO RECALIBRATE AND

02:33:25.530 --> 02:33:29.267 region:rollup2
REBALANCE THE DESIRE TO GO

02:33:27.532 --> 02:33:31.069 region:rollup2
CURBSIDE VERSUS REDEMPTION

02:33:29.267 --> 02:33:32.470 region:rollup2
CENTER A CLEARLY THAT'S

02:33:31.069 --> 02:33:34.439 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT I JUST

02:33:32.470 --> 02:33:35.606 region:rollup2
CLOSE WITH A POINT OF OPTIMISM.

02:33:34.439 --> 02:33:37.308 region:rollup2
.

02:33:35.606 --> 02:33:39.644 region:rollup2
SHOES AND HAD MENTIONED IT.

02:33:37.308 --> 02:33:42.046 region:rollup2
MY CLIENTS HAVE SUPPORTED WHAT

02:33:39.644 --> 02:33:43.781 region:rollup2
MARK MARIE HAD PROPOSED.

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:45.450 region:rollup2
EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE TO

02:33:43.781 --> 02:33:47.852 region:rollup2
FIXTURES THAT THAT CHAIR IN THIS

02:33:45.450 --> 02:33:50.822 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IS FAMILIAR WITH AND

02:33:47.852 --> 02:33:52.490 region:rollup2
ALSO. WE'VE SUPPORTED.

02:33:50.822 --> 02:33:54.125 region:rollup2
STABILIZING THE PLASTIC MARKET

02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:57.128 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT AND MAKE IT

02:33:54.125 --> 02:33:58.229 region:rollup2
MORE ROBUST SO HOPEFULLY THERE'S

02:33:57.128 --> 02:33:58.863 region:rollup2
A HEARING WILL SPARK THOSE

02:33:58.229 --> 02:34:04.135 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS

02:33:58.863 --> 02:34:06.204 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:34:04.135 --> 02:34:07.572 region:rollup2

CONTAINER RECYCLING COMPANY IN

02:34:11.142 --> 02:34:13.945 region:rollup2
THE WORLD.

02:34:11.876 --> 02:34:15.513 region:rollup2
LIKE MR MURRAY EXACTLY DONE THE

02:34:13.945 --> 02:34:18.182 region:rollup2
THINGS. THE BEGINNING OF THE

02:34:15.513 --> 02:34:19.617 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND I HAVE TO. PICK UP

02:34:18.182 --> 02:34:21.586 region:rollup2
ON A QUICK COMMENT MISTER PATTON

02:34:19.617 --> 02:34:22.987 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MADE WHEN YOU THAT WHAT

02:34:21.586 --> 02:34:23.654 region:rollup2
ABOUT A FOURTH CONTAINER.

02:34:22.987 --> 02:34:24.689 region:rollup2
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHAT

02:34:23.654 --> 02:34:27.258 region:rollup2
WE DID SEPARATE

02:34:24.689 --> 02:34:28.893 region:rollup2
PAPER LAUGH ENHANCED.

02:34:27.258 --> 02:34:30.394 region:rollup2
AND THE REAL CONTAMINATION WITH

02:34:28.893 --> 02:34:31.963 region:rollup2
LAP THAT THE CURRENT HE IS WHEN

02:34:30.394 --> 02:34:33.231 region:rollup2
IT PICKED UP A CURB TIED.

02:34:31.963 --> 02:34:34.565 region:rollup2
THE BROKEN GLASS AND BAD IN THE

02:34:33.231 --> 02:34:35.600 region:rollup2
PAPER.

02:34:34.565 --> 02:34:37.802 region:rollup2
AND THAT DIDN'T MAKE THAT

02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:39.871 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE FOR MY CLIENT TO

02:34:37.802 --> 02:34:41.139 region:rollup2
RECEIVE QUALITY COLOR WHICH BY

02:34:39.871 --> 02:34:43.107 region:rollup2
THE WAY WE DEPEND ON.

02:34:41.139 --> 02:34:44.675 region:rollup2
TO LOWER OUR CARBON DIOXIDE

02:34:43.107 --> 02:34:46.077 region:rollup2
EMISSION COME COMMITTEE BEEN

02:34:44.675 --> 02:34:47.278 region:rollup2
VERY FOCUSED APPROPRIATELY ON

02:34:46.077 --> 02:34:48.846 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE

02:34:47.278 --> 02:34:51.115 region:rollup2
WE ARE.

02:34:48.846 --> 02:34:52.783 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON HIGH QUALITY COLOR

02:34:51.115 --> 02:34:53.951 region:rollup2
IT IN ORDER TO REDUCE OUR CARBON

02:34:52.783 --> 02:34:56.087 region:rollup2
FOOTPRINT.

THE WE WANT THAT CLEAN COAL IT

02:34:56.087 --> 02:34:59.657 region:rollup2
STREAM BUT FIND IT VERY

02:34:57.488 --> 02:35:01.292 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO GET BY THE WAY A

02:34:59.657 --> 02:35:02.860 region:rollup2
QUICK COMPARISON WITH OREGON.

02:35:01.292 --> 02:35:03.995 region:rollup2
NO THE ROOF MENTION THAT WE PAID

WE'RE PAYING THIRTY PERCENT

02:35:05.163 --> 02:35:08.366 region:rollup2
HIGHER.

OF PAYING IN OREGON.

02:35:11.769 --> 02:35:15.072 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHY AREAS BUT WE

02:35:13.437 --> 02:35:17.008 region:rollup2
NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS BECAUSE

02:35:15.072 --> 02:35:18.643 region:rollup2
WE'RE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR HIGH

02:35:17.008 --> 02:35:20.211 region:rollup2
QUALITY COLOR. THE YET TO THAT

02:35:18.643 --> 02:35:22.647 region:rollup2
POINT AGAIN WE NEED TO EXPLORE

02:35:20.211 --> 02:35:24.615 region:rollup2
EITHER REMOVING GO LAUGH OR

02:35:22.647 --> 02:35:26.584 region:rollup2
REMOVING PAPER FROM THAT CURB

02:35:24.615 --> 02:35:28.319 region:rollup2
TRIED BEEN SO THAT YOU GET A

02:35:26.584 --> 02:35:29.954 region:rollup2

WOULD YOU CAN BUY WITH THE PAPER

02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:35.493 region:rollup2
YOU GET THE CONTAMINATION THAT

02:35:33.891 --> 02:35:36.827 region:rollup2
BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE.

02:35:35.493 --> 02:35:39.230 region:rollup2

INFORMATIONAL ISSUE TO THE

02:35:51.075 --> 02:35:54.445 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF THE MATTRESS

02:35:52.276 --> 02:35:56.981 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PROGRAM BEGINNING WITH

02:35:54.445 --> 02:36:00.852 region:rollup2
A BRIEF PRESENTATION BY ASHLEY

MORNING ACTUALLY AIMS WITH THE.

02:36:19.637 --> 02:36:23.407 region:rollup2
ALEJO.

02:36:21.105 --> 02:36:24.809 region:rollup2
SO SO MUCH BEFORE THERE'S A

02:36:23.407 --> 02:36:26.310 region:rollup2
BAND OUT ON THE ROAD KIND OF

02:36:24.809 --> 02:36:27.945 region:rollup2
JUST BE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

FOR YOU BUT PLEASE. FEEL FREE TO

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:30.248 region:rollup2
STOP AND ASK QUESTIONS AS WE GO

02:36:29.313 --> 02:36:31.816 region:rollup2
ALONG.

02:36:30.248 --> 02:36:33.384 region:rollup2
PERSONAL JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:36:31.816 --> 02:36:34.652 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

02:36:33.384 --> 02:36:35.753 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND AND WHAT THE

02:36:34.652 --> 02:36:37.321 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE.

02:36:35.753 --> 02:36:39.357 region:rollup2
THEN SECONDLY I'LL TALK A

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:40.424 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE BASIS

02:36:39.357 --> 02:36:43.194 region:rollup2
OF THE PROGRAM WAS WHICH IS THE

02:36:40.424 --> 02:36:43.961 region:rollup2
IDEA BEHIND IT EXTENDED PRODUCER

02:36:43.194 --> 02:36:46.097 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY.

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:48.232 region:rollup2
THIRD WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION

02:36:46.097 --> 02:36:48.799 region:rollup2
ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:50.334 region:rollup2
MATCHES COLLECTION UNDER THE

02:36:48.799 --> 02:36:51.969 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:36:50.334 --> 02:36:52.870 region:rollup2
FOURTH US OF THE MATERIALS THAT

02:36:51.969 --> 02:36:54.505 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN COLLECTED THROUGH THE

02:36:52.870 --> 02:36:56.374 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND BEEN ABLE TO BE

02:36:54.505 --> 02:36:58.442 region:rollup2
REUSED. AND THEN FINALLY LOOKING

02:36:56.374 --> 02:37:00.278 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE BUDGET FOR TWO

02:36:58.442 --> 02:37:00.878 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EACH.

02:37:00.278 --> 02:37:02.613 region:rollup2
SO YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST PITCH

02:37:00.878 --> 02:37:04.415 region:rollup2
A.

02:37:02.613 --> 02:37:05.583 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WAS ENACTED IN TWO

02:37:04.415 --> 02:37:06.884 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN STATUTE.

02:37:05.583 --> 02:37:08.085 region:rollup2
.

02:37:06.884 --> 02:37:09.487 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ENGINE THE TO INCREASE

02:37:08.085 --> 02:37:10.655 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF MATTRESSES.

02:37:09.487 --> 02:37:12.523 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT I'M SAYING

02:37:10.655 --> 02:37:13.557 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES I'M GONNA BE USING

02:37:12.523 --> 02:37:14.992 region:rollup2
THAT ONE WHERE BUT ALSO DEFERRED

02:37:13.557 --> 02:37:15.960 region:rollup2
A BOX.

02:37:14.992 --> 02:37:17.561 region:rollup2
BOX SPRINGS FOUNDATIONS LIKE

02:37:15.960 --> 02:37:19.797 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO.

02:37:17.561 --> 02:37:21.499 region:rollup2
THE RECYCLED US LIKELY TO

02:37:19.797 --> 02:37:22.600 region:rollup2
DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE NETWORK.

02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:23.834 region:rollup2
OF COLLECTION CENTERS AND

02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:25.603 region:rollup2
RECYCLING FACILITIES FOR

02:37:23.834 --> 02:37:27.305 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES AND THEN THIRD TO TRY

02:37:25.603 --> 02:37:28.339 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON

02:37:27.305 --> 02:37:30.541 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF MATCHES THAT ARE

02:37:28.339 --> 02:37:31.275 region:rollup2
DUMPED ILLEGALLY. AND THOSE

02:37:30.541 --> 02:37:33.010 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED CLEAN UP COSTS.

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:34.211 region:rollup2
SO.

02:37:33.010 --> 02:37:35.646 region:rollup2
PERCENT THE LEGISLATION THE

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:36.914 region:rollup2
MATTRESS PRODUCERS THROUGH THEIR

02:37:35.646 --> 02:37:38.416 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION DEAD

02:37:36.914 --> 02:37:40.618 region:rollup2
FORM THE MATTRESS RECYCLING

02:37:38.416 --> 02:37:42.386 region:rollup2
COUNCIL OR A MERCY. ON IN THERE

02:37:40.618 --> 02:37:44.088 region:rollup2
THE ONE THAT RUNS THE ONLY

02:37:42.386 --> 02:37:45.356 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE ONLY A PROGRAM ON

02:37:44.088 --> 02:37:47.725 region:rollup2
THE HOUSE BEEN CERTIFIED BY CAL

02:37:45.356 --> 02:37:48.926 region:rollup2
RECYCLE AYE WITHIN THE STATE

02:37:47.725 --> 02:37:50.728 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

02:37:48.926 --> 02:37:52.096 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS FUNDED BY A FEE

02:37:50.728 --> 02:37:53.731 region:rollup2
THAT CONSUMERS PAY IT WHEN THEY

02:37:52.096 --> 02:37:55.833 region:rollup2
PURCHASE A NEW MATTRESS. ARE

02:37:53.731 --> 02:37:57.034 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE FEE IS TEN DOLLARS

02:37:55.833 --> 02:37:58.803 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY CENTS THAT IS

02:37:57.034 --> 02:38:00.471 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY BEEN ELEVEN DOLLARS

02:37:58.803 --> 02:38:01.872 region:rollup2
AND WAS RECENTLY WERE.

02:38:00.471 --> 02:38:02.907 region:rollup2
REVISED DOWN ON JANUARY FIRST

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:04.308 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND

02:38:02.907 --> 02:38:06.444 region:rollup2
THAT WAS BECAUSE EMARCY WAS

02:38:04.308 --> 02:38:07.545 region:rollup2
PROJECTING A SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS

02:38:06.444 --> 02:38:09.046 region:rollup2
FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.

02:38:07.545 --> 02:38:10.715 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:11.949 region:rollup2
I'M FINALLY THEM MAIN ROLE OF

02:38:10.715 --> 02:38:14.752 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAN IN THIS INDUSTRY

02:38:11.949 --> 02:38:15.820 region:rollup2
RUN SYSTEM IS MOSTLY A OVERSIGHT

02:38:14.752 --> 02:38:18.089 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AND INCOME RECYCLE

02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:19.523 region:rollup2
TAKES CARE OF THAT.

02:38:18.089 --> 02:38:21.359 region:rollup2
SO THEN ON THE SECOND PAGE.

02:38:19.523 --> 02:38:23.160 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT BASIS FOR THE

02:38:21.359 --> 02:38:24.128 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS EXTENT USERS

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:25.763 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OR.

02:38:24.128 --> 02:38:27.932 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE A PRODUCT

02:38:25.763 --> 02:38:30.868 region:rollup2
STEWARDSHIP AND SO JUST THE IDEA

02:38:27.932 --> 02:38:31.435 region:rollup2
THAT THE PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS

02:38:30.868 --> 02:38:32.169 region:rollup2
OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE OUT OF

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:34.005 region:rollup2
SHOULD.

02:38:32.169 --> 02:38:36.474 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THE COST

02:38:34.005 --> 02:38:38.409 region:rollup2
OF THEIR I END OF LIFE EITHER

02:38:36.474 --> 02:38:40.077 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING.

02:38:38.409 --> 02:38:41.212 region:rollup2
AND.

02:38:40.077 --> 02:38:43.114 region:rollup2
CONCEPTUALLY THAT'S BECAUSE IF

02:38:41.212 --> 02:38:45.015 region:rollup2
YOU REQUIRE THEM TO PAY FOR THE

02:38:43.114 --> 02:38:46.317 region:rollup2
TOTAL LIFETIME COSTS THAT WOULD

02:38:45.015 --> 02:38:47.752 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE WITHIN THE PRICE

02:38:46.317 --> 02:38:48.886 region:rollup2
THAT'S PAID BY THE CONSUMER AT

02:38:47.752 --> 02:38:51.055 region:rollup2
THE TIME OF PURCHASE.

02:38:48.886 --> 02:38:52.189 region:rollup2
TO COVER ALL THE COSTS MOVES A

02:38:51.055 --> 02:38:53.557 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN SOME

02:38:52.189 --> 02:38:54.892 region:rollup2
OTHER WASTE MANAGEMENT THAT

02:38:53.557 --> 02:38:56.560 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WHERE A LOCAL

02:38:54.892 --> 02:38:58.629 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND TAXPAYERS WOULD

02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.830 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY. A COVER THOSE COSTS

02:38:58.629 --> 02:39:02.333 region:rollup2
THROUGH A WASTE MANAGEMENT

02:38:59.830 --> 02:39:04.068 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:39:02.333 --> 02:39:05.803 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE THIRD PAGE.

02:39:04.068 --> 02:39:07.371 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT.

02:39:05.803 --> 02:39:08.806 region:rollup2
COLLECTION METHODS THAT ARE

02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:10.808 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

02:39:08.806 --> 02:39:12.476 region:rollup2
THERE OPERATED A NETWORK OF NO

02:39:10.808 --> 02:39:14.345 region:rollup2
COST DROP OFF SITES WHERE YOU

02:39:12.476 --> 02:39:15.479 region:rollup2
CAN GO A DROP OFF YOUR MATCHES

02:39:14.345 --> 02:39:17.314 region:rollup2
FOR FREE AND AS YOU CAN SEE

02:39:15.479 --> 02:39:18.649 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE. WAY THE MOST THE

02:39:17.314 --> 02:39:19.650 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES ON THE STATE ARE

02:39:18.649 --> 02:39:22.686 region:rollup2
COLLECTED.

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:24.221 region:rollup2
SECONDLY RETAILERS CAN OURS

02:39:22.686 --> 02:39:25.823 region:rollup2
NEED TO OFFER TO TAKE ALL

02:39:24.221 --> 02:39:27.858 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES BACK FREE OF CHARGE

02:39:25.823 --> 02:39:28.893 region:rollup2
WITH A DELIVER A NEW MATTRESS.

02:39:27.858 --> 02:39:29.794 region:rollup2
OF AND SO THAT'S THE SECOND MOST

02:39:28.893 --> 02:39:31.295 region:rollup2
COMMON.

02:39:29.794 --> 02:39:32.730 region:rollup2
AND THEN THIRDLY THEY DO OFFER

02:39:31.295 --> 02:39:34.231 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL INCENTIVE UP FOR

02:39:32.730 --> 02:39:35.900 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS TO TAKE THE MATTRESS I

02:39:34.231 --> 02:39:38.269 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY TO RECYCLING CENTERS

02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:39.737 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES ABOUT THREE DOLLARS.

02:39:38.269 --> 02:39:40.938 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ALSO AGREEMENTS WITH

02:39:39.737 --> 02:39:43.174 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT HAVE A LOT OF

02:39:40.938 --> 02:39:43.674 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES. LIKE HOTELS FOR

02:39:43.174 --> 02:39:45.509 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ON IN THE VALLEY

02:39:43.674 --> 02:39:46.410 region:rollup2
THERE'S.

02:39:45.509 --> 02:39:48.946 region:rollup2
COLLECTION OF AND THROUGHOUT THE

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:50.581 region:rollup2
STATE ITEM THAT ARE HOSTED BY

02:39:48.946 --> 02:39:52.450 region:rollup2
MRC.

02:39:50.581 --> 02:39:54.618 region:rollup2
SO LOOKING AT THE FOURTH PITCH.

02:39:52.450 --> 02:39:55.986 region:rollup2
TO SEE A SENSE OF SOME OF THE

02:39:54.618 --> 02:39:57.955 region:rollup2
MATERIALS THAT WE'VE COLLECTED

02:39:55.986 --> 02:39:59.690 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM FOR RE USE

02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:00.624 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:02.193 region:rollup2
FEEL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF

02:40:00.624 --> 02:40:04.495 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES THE LARGEST ONE IS

02:40:02.193 --> 02:40:06.597 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY US STEEL WHICH MAKES A

02:40:04.495 --> 02:40:08.032 region:rollup2
LOT MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL

02:40:06.597 --> 02:40:10.134 region:rollup2
AMOUNT BY. WEIGHT.

02:40:08.032 --> 02:40:11.902 region:rollup2
.

02:40:10.134 --> 02:40:13.137 region:rollup2
IN TOTAL OF FOR TWO THOUSAND

02:40:11.902 --> 02:40:15.172 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN FORTY SIX MILLION HOW

02:40:13.137 --> 02:40:16.307 region:rollup2
THE MATERIAL WAS COLLECTED ABOUT

02:40:15.172 --> 02:40:17.641 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE THE

DOES FOLLOW A PRODUCER

02:41:48.599 --> 02:41:51.769 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH WHICH IS

02:41:50.201 --> 02:41:53.003 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT MODEL THAN FOR

02:41:51.769 --> 02:41:54.071 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THE BOTTLE BILL THAT

02:41:53.003 --> 02:41:55.506 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING.

02:41:54.071 --> 02:41:57.708 region:rollup2
THIS DOES PLACE RESPONSIBILITY

ORGANIZATION.

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:03.881 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY THE MATCHES

02:42:01.111 --> 02:42:04.281 region:rollup2
RECYCLING COUNCIL OR MRC. AND

02:42:03.881 --> 02:42:05.249 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:42:04.281 --> 02:42:07.484 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

02:42:05.249 --> 02:42:08.786 region:rollup2
HAS OVERSIGHT ROLE IN THIS CASE.

02:42:07.484 --> 02:42:10.087 region:rollup2
VESTED BY THE LEGISLATURE CAL

02:42:08.786 --> 02:42:11.689 region:rollup2
RECYCLE.

02:42:10.087 --> 02:42:12.756 region:rollup2
SO ONE CENTRAL PREMISE OF A

02:42:11.689 --> 02:42:14.225 region:rollup2
PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY APPROACH

02:42:12.756 --> 02:42:15.993 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

02:42:14.225 --> 02:42:17.428 region:rollup2
STATE ARM THE GOVERNMENT'S DOES

02:42:15.993 --> 02:42:18.963 region:rollup2
SET THE GOALS AND OTHER PROGRAM

02:42:17.428 --> 02:42:19.763 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS AND PROVIDE THAT

02:42:18.963 --> 02:42:21.265 region:rollup2
PROGRAM ENFORCEMENT AND

02:42:19.763 --> 02:42:23.100 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT.

02:42:21.265 --> 02:42:23.634 region:rollup2
SO CAL RECYCLE IS TASKED WITH

02:42:23.100 --> 02:42:24.468 region:rollup2
DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS

02:42:23.634 --> 02:42:26.036 region:rollup2
INCLUDING.

02:42:24.468 --> 02:42:28.539 region:rollup2
APPOINTING MEMBERS OF THE

02:42:26.036 --> 02:42:30.207 region:rollup2
ADVISORY COMMITTEE POSTING LISTA

02:42:28.539 --> 02:42:32.076 region:rollup2
COMPLIANT MANUFACTURERS.

02:42:30.207 --> 02:42:34.111 region:rollup2
AND RENOVATORS AYE WE REVIEW

02:42:32.076 --> 02:42:35.646 region:rollup2
AND APPROVE THE COUNCIL'S PLAN

02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:36.614 region:rollup2
AND IT'S BUDGETS AND AND THE

02:42:35.646 --> 02:42:38.115 region:rollup2
REPORTS.

02:42:36.614 --> 02:42:39.083 region:rollup2
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO ESTABLISH

02:42:38.115 --> 02:42:39.717 region:rollup2
STATE RECYCLING.

02:42:39.083 --> 02:42:46.890 region:rollup2
STATE RECYCLING AND ENSURE THAT

02:42:39.717 --> 02:42:48.325 region:rollup2
THE COUNCIL

02:42:46.890 --> 02:42:50.427 region:rollup2
MAKES A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO

02:42:48.325 --> 02:42:51.929 region:rollup2
COMPLY WITH THOSE GOALS AND

02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:52.463 region:rollup2
FINALLY CONDUCT VARIOUS ON

02:42:51.929 --> 02:42:53.797 region:rollup2
INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT

02:42:52.463 --> 02:42:54.798 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

02:42:53.797 --> 02:42:57.034 region:rollup2
I THINK THE SECOND PREMISE OF A

02:42:54.798 --> 02:42:59.637 region:rollup2
PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY

02:42:57.034 --> 02:43:00.771 region:rollup2
APPROACHES THAT THE. I IN THIS

02:42:59.637 --> 02:43:02.039 region:rollup2
CASE THE MRC BUT THEN THE

02:43:00.771 --> 02:43:02.806 region:rollup2
RECYCLING ORGANIZATION SET UP BY

02:43:02.039 --> 02:43:04.742 region:rollup2
THE MANUFACTURERS.

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:06.810 region:rollup2
HAS CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:43:04.742 --> 02:43:08.512 region:rollup2
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM

02:43:06.810 --> 02:43:10.281 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE STATUTORY DIRECTION.

02:43:08.512 --> 02:43:12.416 region:rollup2
SO IN THIS CASE.

02:43:10.281 --> 02:43:12.883 region:rollup2
IS MS AIM SAID MRC IS REQUIRED

02:43:12.416 --> 02:43:14.018 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP FINANCE AND

02:43:12.883 --> 02:43:15.586 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT.

02:43:14.018 --> 02:43:17.955 region:rollup2
A CONVENIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE

02:43:15.586 --> 02:43:20.391 region:rollup2
COLLECTION TO RECOVER. AND

02:43:17.955 --> 02:43:21.525 region:rollup2
RECYCLE I USE MATTRESSES THAT

02:43:20.391 --> 02:43:24.194 region:rollup2
ARE GENERATED IN THE STATE.

02:43:21.525 --> 02:43:26.196 region:rollup2
SO WE DID RECEIVE OF M. R. C.'S.

02:43:24.194 --> 02:43:28.532 region:rollup2
PLAN FOR THIS PROGRAM IN

02:43:26.196 --> 02:43:29.566 region:rollup2
JANUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN WE

02:43:28.532 --> 02:43:31.168 region:rollup2
REALLY PROVED IT. IN JANUARY

02:43:29.566 --> 02:43:33.971 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN IN THE BASICS OF

02:43:31.168 --> 02:43:34.805 region:rollup2
THE PLAN INCLUDE USING FUNDS

02:43:33.971 --> 02:43:39.309 region:rollup2
FROM THE MATCHES RECYCLING

CHARGE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION OUT

02:43:39.309 --> 02:43:40.744 region:rollup2
REACHED PARTICIPANTS.

02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:41.812 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED NO COST COLLECTION

02:43:40.744 --> 02:43:42.279 region:rollup2

EVERY JULY THE.

02:43:51.288 --> 02:43:53.457 region:rollup2
MATTRESS YOU PSYCH COUNCIL HAS

02:43:52.323 --> 02:43:55.426 region:rollup2
TO SUBMIT A BUDGET.

02:43:53.457 --> 02:43:56.994 region:rollup2
FOR THE NEXT YEAR CALENDAR YEAR

AND ITS ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE

02:43:56.994 --> 02:43:59.963 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS CALENDAR YEAR.

02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:01.198 region:rollup2
SO HAS MENTIONED.

02:43:59.963 --> 02:44:02.700 region:rollup2
THE MRC DID SUBMIT A BUDGET

02:44:01.198 --> 02:44:04.568 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDED REDUCING THE

02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:05.703 region:rollup2
MATTRESS CHARGE ARE THE YOU TO

CHARGE PER UNIT.

02:44:05.703 --> 02:44:09.807 region:rollup2
FROM ELEVEN DOLLARS DOWN TO TEN

02:44:07.871 --> 02:44:11.041 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS.

02:44:09.807 --> 02:44:12.042 region:rollup2
I THIS SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:44:11.041 --> 02:44:13.711 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE ADVISORY COUNCIL

02:44:12.042 --> 02:44:14.845 region:rollup2
HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

02:44:13.711 --> 02:44:16.580 region:rollup2
REDUCTION.

02:44:14.845 --> 02:44:17.014 region:rollup2
BECAUSE UP EVEN AFTER ONLY A

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:18.649 region:rollup2
YEAR AND A HALF OF

02:44:17.014 --> 02:44:20.317 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE OF SOME

02:44:18.649 --> 02:44:21.719 region:rollup2
OF THE GAPS IN. OUR COLLECTION

02:44:20.317 --> 02:44:22.753 region:rollup2
COVERAGE AND PROGRAM

02:44:21.719 --> 02:44:24.254 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION.

02:44:22.753 --> 02:44:25.255 region:rollup2
CALVET SAKAL DID GO AHEAD AND

02:44:24.254 --> 02:44:27.758 region:rollup2
APPROVE THAT.

02:44:25.255 --> 02:44:29.259 region:rollup2
BUDGET REQUEST FROM THE MRC FOR

02:44:27.758 --> 02:44:30.894 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY ONE IS

02:44:29.259 --> 02:44:31.729 region:rollup2
THAT THE REQUEST MET ALL THE

02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:33.664 region:rollup2
VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS A STATUTE

02:44:31.729 --> 02:44:34.898 region:rollup2
BUT. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT THE

02:44:33.664 --> 02:44:35.265 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN REVENUES BETWEEN

02:44:34.898 --> 02:44:36.700 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:44:35.265 --> 02:44:38.202 region:rollup2
LEVIN DOLLARS IN THE TEN

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:39.336 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS IS ABOUT

02:44:38.202 --> 02:44:41.205 region:rollup2
ONLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:43.574 region:rollup2
PROJECTED FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:44:41.205 --> 02:44:45.309 region:rollup2
IN THE MRC HAS A RESERVE OF

02:44:43.574 --> 02:44:48.379 region:rollup2
ROUGHLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:44:45.309 --> 02:44:50.147 region:rollup2
SO IT HAS A SUBSTANTIAL. OF FUN

02:44:48.379 --> 02:44:51.715 region:rollup2
THAT IT CAN DRAWN TO IT.

02:44:50.147 --> 02:44:55.185 region:rollup2
USE FOR ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES

02:44:51.715 --> 02:44:56.253 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT.

02:44:55.185 --> 02:44:56.687 region:rollup2
I HAD THE MATCH THAT COUNSEL

02:44:56.253 --> 02:44:59.323 region:rollup2
THEN SUBMITTED ITS.

02:44:56.687 --> 02:45:08.532 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND REPORT.

02:44:59.323 --> 02:45:09.600 region:rollup2
IN MID YEAR MID TWENTY

02:45:08.532 --> 02:45:10.567 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THIS WAS THE PROGRAM'S

02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:11.235 region:rollup2
FIRST REPORT.

02:45:10.567 --> 02:45:12.136 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT OUT THAT THIS IS

02:45:11.235 --> 02:45:12.536 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAROF IMPLEMENTATION

02:45:12.136 --> 02:45:13.404 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROGRAM.

02:45:12.536 --> 02:45:14.805 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CALENDAR

02:45:13.404 --> 02:45:15.439 region:rollup2
YEAR AND ALSO THAT WE HAD NOT

02:45:14.805 --> 02:45:16.240 region:rollup2
YET ESTABLISHED.

02:45:15.439 --> 02:45:17.074 region:rollup2
THE RECYCLING BASELINE AND.

02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:18.909 region:rollup2
GOALS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE

02:45:17.074 --> 02:45:20.010 region:rollup2
JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

02:45:18.909 --> 02:45:21.211 region:rollup2
WE DID REVIEW THAT PLAN AND

02:45:20.010 --> 02:45:22.012 region:rollup2
LAST SEPTEMBER FOUND THAT THE

02:45:21.211 --> 02:45:22.646 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS PERFORMING ACCORDING

02:45:22.012 --> 02:45:24.681 region:rollup2
TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATUTE

02:45:22.646 --> 02:45:25.516 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

02:45:24.681 --> 02:45:26.850 region:rollup2
AND IS ACHIEVING MOST THE GOALS

02:45:25.516 --> 02:45:27.718 region:rollup2
IN ITS PLAN.

02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:29.520 region:rollup2
EVEN SO WHAT ARE WE DID IDENTIFY

02:45:27.718 --> 02:45:31.288 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES THAT WE

02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:32.489 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THE PROGRAM STILL NEEDS

02:45:31.288 --> 02:45:48.806 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS.

02:45:32.489 --> 02:45:48.806 region:rollup2
AS IT

02:45:53.811 --> 02:45:54.945 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND

02:45:54.311 --> 02:45:58.882 region:rollup2
MATURE.

02:45:54.945 --> 02:45:59.416 region:rollup2
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS A

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:00.884 region:rollup2
OF JUST MENTION THREE IN

02:45:59.416 --> 02:46:01.452 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR. ADEPTLY MORE

02:46:00.884 --> 02:46:02.986 region:rollup2
COLLECTION SITES ARE NEEDED

02:46:01.452 --> 02:46:03.887 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE PARTICULARLY AND RURAL

02:46:02.986 --> 02:46:05.422 region:rollup2
AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

02:46:03.887 --> 02:46:07.124 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS.

02:46:05.422 --> 02:46:08.325 region:rollup2
SITUATION IS THAT NOT ALL SOLID

02:46:07.124 --> 02:46:08.892 region:rollup2
WASTE FACILITIES TRANSFER

02:46:08.325 --> 02:46:13.797 region:rollup2
STATIONS IT'S A TOUGH ONE TO

02:46:08.892 --> 02:46:15.933 region:rollup2
ASSESS.

02:46:13.797 --> 02:46:17.668 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL IMPACT RIGHT NOW ON

02:46:15.933 --> 02:46:19.236 region:rollup2
RENOVATORS PARTLY BECAUSE THE

02:46:17.668 --> 02:46:21.171 region:rollup2
RENOVATORS THEMSELVES ARE NOT

02:46:19.236 --> 02:46:22.606 region:rollup2
FULLY REPORTING TO US IN OUR OWN

02:46:21.171 --> 02:46:24.541 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

02:46:22.606 --> 02:46:25.576 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT.

02:46:24.541 --> 02:46:27.077 region:rollup2
AND THIRDLY THE.

02:46:25.576 --> 02:46:28.045 region:rollup2
PROGRAM STILL NEEDS TO FURTHER

02:46:27.077 --> 02:46:29.012 region:rollup2
ADDRESS ILL ILLEGAL DUMPING THIS

02:46:28.045 --> 02:46:30.113 region:rollup2
IS

02:46:29.012 --> 02:46:32.449 region:rollup2
STILL CONTINUES TO BE A

02:46:30.113 --> 02:46:33.150 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. AYE THERE

02:46:32.449 --> 02:46:34.351 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF

02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:35.219 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION FROM LOCAL

02:46:34.351 --> 02:46:36.920 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IN SOME OF THE

02:46:35.219 --> 02:46:39.323 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AT THE EMBASSIES PUT

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:40.958 region:rollup2
FORTH BUT WE HOPE TO SEE THAT.

02:46:39.323 --> 02:46:42.826 region:rollup2
BY INCREASING THE FUTURE.

02:46:40.958 --> 02:46:44.761 region:rollup2
AT LAST NOVEMBER WE DID

02:46:42.826 --> 02:46:46.196 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THE STATE RECYCLING

02:46:44.761 --> 02:46:47.931 region:rollup2
BASELINE AND GOALS ARE PURSUANT

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:49.199 region:rollup2
TO STATUTE. THOSE BECOME A

02:46:47.931 --> 02:46:51.502 region:rollup2
FACTOR BECAME EFFECTIVE IN

02:46:49.199 --> 02:46:53.237 region:rollup2
JANUARY. OF THIS YEAR.

02:46:51.502 --> 02:46:54.705 region:rollup2
THOSE GOALS FOCUS ON INCREASING

02:46:53.237 --> 02:46:56.740 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT ARE

02:46:54.705 --> 02:46:58.108 region:rollup2
COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING

02:46:56.740 --> 02:47:00.210 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THE NUMBER OF UNITS

02:46:58.108 --> 02:47:01.445 region:rollup2
RENOVATED. AND INCREASING THE

02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:03.480 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE MATERIALS RECOVERED

02:47:01.445 --> 02:47:04.548 region:rollup2
FROM RECYCLED MATTRESSES.

02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:06.683 region:rollup2
I ONE THING TO NOTICE THAT WE

02:47:04.548 --> 02:47:09.186 region:rollup2
DID NOT ESTABLISH STATEWIDE I'M

02:47:06.683 --> 02:47:10.120 region:rollup2
RECYCLING PERCENTAGE RATE LIKE

02:47:09.186 --> 02:47:11.488 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SHOOT FOR SEVENTY FIVE

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:13.123 region:rollup2
PERCENT RECYCLING RATE OR

02:47:11.488 --> 02:47:15.292 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. REASON FOR

02:47:13.123 --> 02:47:15.759 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT THAT KIND OF RATE

02:47:15.292 --> 02:47:16.827 region:rollup2
REQUIRES TWO PIECES OF

02:47:15.759 --> 02:47:17.928 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

02:47:16.827 --> 02:47:19.630 region:rollup2
HOW MANY MATTRESSES ARE

02:47:17.928 --> 02:47:21.532 region:rollup2
COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING DIVIDED

02:47:19.630 --> 02:47:22.966 region:rollup2
BY HOW MANY MATTRESSES ARE

02:47:21.532 --> 02:47:24.401 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR RECYCLING

02:47:22.966 --> 02:47:25.502 region:rollup2
WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION

02:47:24.401 --> 02:47:26.670 region:rollup2
ON THE FIRST PROPONENT PART OF

02:47:25.502 --> 02:47:28.472 region:rollup2
THAT? BUT WE DON'T HAVE

02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:30.240 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON WHAT'S REALLY

02:47:28.472 --> 02:47:31.842 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE HOW OFTEN PEOPLE BRING

02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:33.477 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES OUT SO WE CAN'T

02:47:31.842 --> 02:47:34.478 region:rollup2
REALLY CALCULATOR RECYCLING RATE

02:47:33.477 --> 02:47:35.546 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT.

02:47:34.478 --> 02:47:37.614 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION

02:47:35.546 --> 02:47:38.749 region:rollup2
ON THAT AND WE CAN. REVISIT

02:47:37.614 --> 02:47:40.517 region:rollup2
THESE GOALS.

02:47:38.749 --> 02:47:42.986 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN PURSUANT

02:47:40.517 --> 02:47:44.187 region:rollup2
TO STATUTE.

02:47:42.986 --> 02:47:45.222 region:rollup2
JUST A COUPLE MORE POINTS.

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:47.257 region:rollup2
TO MAKE.

02:47:45.222 --> 02:47:48.492 region:rollup2
ONE IS THAT WE HAVE CONDUCTED

02:47:47.257 --> 02:47:50.761 region:rollup2
ALMOST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

02:47:48.492 --> 02:47:52.996 region:rollup2
INSPECTIONS OF. RETAILERS AND

02:47:50.761 --> 02:47:54.731 region:rollup2
RENOVATORS AND OTHER ENTITIES

02:47:52.996 --> 02:47:56.033 region:rollup2
UNDER THE REGULATED UNDER LAW.

02:47:54.731 --> 02:47:57.868 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE STILL HAVE SOME

02:47:56.033 --> 02:47:59.069 region:rollup2
ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BUT ABOUT

02:47:57.868 --> 02:48:01.271 region:rollup2
OVER THREE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN

02:47:59.069 --> 02:48:03.240 region:rollup2
COMPLETED. OF THOSE ABOUT A

02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:05.309 region:rollup2
QUARTER WERE FULLY COMPLIANT

02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:07.110 region:rollup2
HIGH IN THE INSPECTION THREE

FORCE HAD SOME KIND OF VIOLATION

02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:10.447 region:rollup2
IN THE FIGHT RANGE OF VIOLATIONS

02:48:08.512 --> 02:48:11.081 region:rollup2
IS PRETTY WIDE AND. I GIVE YOU

RECEIVED A VIOLATION OUR

02:48:16.987 --> 02:48:19.356 region:rollup2
INSPECTORS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:48:18.188 --> 02:48:20.524 region:rollup2
THEM TO TRY AND BRING THEM INTO

02:48:19.356 --> 02:48:22.225 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE THERE'S A AND

02:48:20.524 --> 02:48:23.894 region:rollup2
EXPECTED DATE. FOR CORRECTIVE

02:48:22.225 --> 02:48:25.896 region:rollup2
ACTION THAT IS NOT PROVIDED TO

THE BUSINESS AND IN MOST CASES

02:48:25.896 --> 02:48:29.433 region:rollup2
THEY DO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IF

02:48:28.031 --> 02:48:31.201 region:rollup2

INTO THAT AND IT IS CRITICAL

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:28.905 region:rollup2
THAT WE PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS THE

02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:40.217 region:rollup2
FIRST AS HOWARD MENTIONED IT HAS

02:52:38.882 --> 02:52:41.518 region:rollup2
BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WE'VE ONLY

02:52:40.217 --> 02:52:42.886 region:rollup2
CHEAP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

02:52:41.518 --> 02:52:44.221 region:rollup2
COLLECTION RATE.

02:52:42.886 --> 02:52:44.754 region:rollup2
THAT RATE IS DERIVED BY SIMPLY

02:52:44.221 --> 02:52:46.590 region:rollup2
DIVIDE IN THE NUMBER OF

02:52:44.754 --> 02:52:48.225 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES COLLECTED IN THE

THE STATE THAT SAME YEAR. BY

02:52:52.362 --> 02:52:56.032 region:rollup2
CALCULATION IS NOT ACCURATE.

02:52:54.598 --> 02:52:57.100 region:rollup2
A MATTRESS IS NOT BOTTOM

02:52:56.032 --> 02:52:58.735 region:rollup2
DISPOSED OF IN THE SAME CALENDAR

DEMONSTRATES THAT ONLY FIFTY

PERCENT OF MATTRESS PURCHASES

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:09.346 region:rollup2
GENERATES A MATTRESS DISCARD.

02:53:07.844 --> 02:53:11.348 region:rollup2

EXPORT MARKETS MEXICO.

02:53:20.023 --> 02:53:22.425 region:rollup2
I ACCURATE COLLECTION RATE IS

02:53:21.224 --> 02:53:24.160 region:rollup2
CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE

ASSESSMENT OF A REAL COLLECTION

02:53:31.067 --> 02:53:32.469 region:rollup2
RATE UNTIL WE'VE HAD ENOUGH

02:53:31.635 --> 02:53:34.104 region:rollup2
TIME.

02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:36.306 region:rollup2
TO COLLECT DISCARD DATA FROM

CALIFORNIA.

02:53:38.108 --> 02:53:41.177 region:rollup2
SECOND IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED WE

02:53:40.277 --> 02:53:42.879 region:rollup2
ARE NOT INVESTING ENOUGH IN

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:44.881 region:rollup2
PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH

02:53:42.879 --> 02:53:46.816 region:rollup2
THAT IS FALSE. MERCY IS A STRONG

PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN THAT

02:53:46.816 --> 02:53:50.420 region:rollup2

A NEW ORGANIZATION.

02:53:50.420 --> 02:53:54.824 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS KNOW WHERE EDUCATION

PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

02:54:22.719 --> 02:54:26.022 region:rollup2
KNOW THEIR MATTRESS CAN BE

02:54:23.987 --> 02:54:27.590 region:rollup2
RECYCLED. THIS INCREDIBLE

02:54:26.022 --> 02:54:28.325 region:rollup2
STATISTIC GIVEN OUR SHORT.

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:30.694 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATION.

02:54:30.694 --> 02:54:34.597 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY WE BANKS MARKED OUR

02:54:32.195 --> 02:54:35.865 region:rollup2
STRATEGY OUTREACH AGAINST OTHER

02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:37.801 region:rollup2
SIMILAR RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN

02:54:35.865 --> 02:54:38.768 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE INVESTING

02:54:37.801 --> 02:54:40.603 region:rollup2
THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF OUR

02:54:38.768 --> 02:54:41.971 region:rollup2
BUDGET HAS THERE'S.

02:54:40.603 --> 02:54:43.740 region:rollup2
THIS DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T WANT

02:54:41.971 --> 02:54:45.875 region:rollup2
TO MORE IN THE FUTURE BUT WE ARE

02:54:43.740 --> 02:54:48.745 region:rollup2
CAREFUL TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES.

02:54:45.875 --> 02:54:50.580 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY.

02:54:48.745 --> 02:54:51.481 region:rollup2
THIRD IT IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:52.983 region:rollup2
THAT EVER SEE IS NOT DOING

02:54:51.481 --> 02:54:54.417 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO COMBAT ILLEGAL DUMPING

02:54:52.983 --> 02:54:56.686 region:rollup2
IS REQUIRED BY S. B. TO FIFTY

02:54:54.417 --> 02:54:57.821 region:rollup2
FOUR BUT SUCH A CONCLUSION IS

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:59.055 region:rollup2
PREMATURE PASSED.

02:54:57.821 --> 02:55:00.357 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S NEVER COLLECTED

02:54:59.055 --> 02:55:02.192 region:rollup2

RECYCLE ILLEGAL DUMPING TASK

02:55:05.962 --> 02:55:10.600 region:rollup2
FORCE AND THE MATTRESS ADVISORY

02:55:07.497 --> 02:55:12.302 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP. AN ILLEGALLY DUMPED

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.969 region:rollup2
MATTRESS COLLECTION INITIATIVE.

02:55:12.302 --> 02:55:14.704 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT AND PAYMENT

02:55:12.969 --> 02:55:16.272 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE MRC PROPOSED WAS

02:55:14.704 --> 02:55:18.241 region:rollup2
CLEARLY DESCRIBED IN OUR TWENTY

FIFTEEN PROGRAM PLAN.

02:55:18.241 --> 02:55:21.111 region:rollup2
THIS IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT WAS

02:55:19.542 --> 02:55:23.980 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED BY OUR STAKEHOLDERS

02:55:21.111 --> 02:55:25.148 region:rollup2
AND APPROVED BY CAL RECYCLE.

02:55:23.980 --> 02:55:26.516 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY GOAL AT THIS EARLY

02:55:25.148 --> 02:55:27.851 region:rollup2
POINT THE PROGRAM IS TO COLLECT

02:55:26.516 --> 02:55:28.718 region:rollup2
ACCURATE DATA SO WE CAN

02:55:27.851 --> 02:55:30.720 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE DUMPING IS A

02:55:28.718 --> 02:55:32.455 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:34.090 region:rollup2
COLLECTING THIS DATA IS A MAJOR

02:55:32.455 --> 02:55:35.625 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKING THAT REQUIRES THE

02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:37.360 region:rollup2
COOPERATION OF MINUTES A PALETTE

02:55:35.625 --> 02:55:39.496 region:rollup2
IS ACROSS THE STATE.

02:55:37.360 --> 02:55:41.231 region:rollup2
MRC HAS BUDGETED THREE QUARTERS

02:55:39.496 --> 02:55:42.599 region:rollup2
OF A MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO

02:55:41.231 --> 02:55:43.566 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THE PROBLEM IS PAYING

02:55:42.599 --> 02:55:46.803 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES FOR THE DATA THEY

02:55:43.566 --> 02:55:47.837 region:rollup2
PROVIDE.

02:55:46.803 --> 02:55:49.539 region:rollup2
AND OUR FIRST YEAR FORTY

02:55:47.837 --> 02:55:50.306 region:rollup2
ENTITIES PARTICIPATED THIS

02:55:49.539 --> 02:55:52.142 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE MORE THAN TWENTY

02:55:50.306 --> 02:55:53.676 region:rollup2
THREE THOUSAND ACTRESSES WERE

COUNTED REMOVED FUNK THESE

02:55:53.676 --> 02:55:56.880 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WITH MRC SUPPORT AND

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:58.248 region:rollup2

02:55:59.883 --> 02:56:04.421 region:rollup2
OF UNITS BY OVER EIGHTY PERCENT.

02:56:02.886 --> 02:56:05.655 region:rollup2
THIS DATA WILL BE CRITICAL GOING

02:56:04.421 --> 02:56:07.657 region:rollup2
FORWARD AS WE IDENTIFY WHERE

02:56:05.655 --> 02:56:08.691 region:rollup2
DUMPING IS A PROBLEM.

02:56:07.657 --> 02:56:10.059 region:rollup2
BASED ON THIS DATA WE CAN FOCUS

02:56:08.691 --> 02:56:11.628 region:rollup2
OUR RESOURCES ON UPSTREAM

02:56:10.059 --> 02:56:14.130 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT PREVENT ILLEGAL

02:56:11.628 --> 02:56:15.131 region:rollup2
DUMPING BEFORE IT OCCURS.

02:56:14.130 --> 02:56:16.733 region:rollup2
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A WORKING

02:56:15.131 --> 02:56:17.901 region:rollup2
ILLEGAL DUMPING IS A PARTNERSHIP

02:56:16.733 --> 02:56:19.769 region:rollup2
WITH FRESNO COUNTY IN A LOCAL

PRO ACTIVELY ADDRESS THE ISSUE.

02:56:49.232 --> 02:56:52.769 region:rollup2
FOURTH IS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT

SOLID WASTE FACILITIES ARE NOT

02:56:52.769 --> 02:56:57.273 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING BECAUSE MRC IS NOT

03:02:35.278 --> 03:02:39.148 region:rollup2
OKAY A OUT OF A REALLY GOOD

03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:41.083 region:rollup2
START AND A WILLINGNESS TO

03:02:39.148 --> 03:02:42.018 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT FEES DON'T ALWAYS

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:43.419 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO UP.

03:02:42.018 --> 03:02:44.453 region:rollup2
AND MATT AS A FIRST TIME I'VE

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:45.488 region:rollup2
EVER SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE OR

03:02:44.453 --> 03:02:48.191 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER BUDGET COMMITTEE IN

03:02:45.488 --> 03:02:50.393 region:rollup2
WHICH WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A FEE.

03:02:48.191 --> 03:02:52.428 region:rollup2
THE CLIENT SLIGHTLY I THINK THIS

03:02:50.393 --> 03:02:53.930 region:rollup2
IS EVIDENCE OF GOOD MANAGEMENT.

03:02:52.428 --> 03:02:55.231 region:rollup2
AND I THINK A LOT OF THE

03:02:53.930 --> 03:02:57.066 region:rollup2
CRITICISMS ARE.

03:02:55.231 --> 03:02:58.668 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK UNNECESSARY AND AND

03:02:57.066 --> 03:03:00.636 region:rollup2
REALLY DON'T GET TO THE TARGET

03:02:58.668 --> 03:03:01.337 region:rollup2
FROM FROM OUR STANDPOINT AND.

03:03:00.636 --> 03:03:03.172 region:rollup2
THE FRESNO REGION.

03:03:01.337 --> 03:03:04.674 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE IT AND.

03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:06.375 region:rollup2

03:03:04.674 --> 03:03:07.643 region:rollup2
FRANKLY.

03:03:06.375 --> 03:03:08.878 region:rollup2
I HAVE DONE AGAIN AND TAKE TAKE

03:03:07.643 --> 03:03:09.645 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT.

03:03:08.878 --> 03:03:11.614 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE.

03:03:09.645 --> 03:03:13.382 region:rollup2
RECYCLING RATES.

03:03:11.614 --> 03:03:15.251 region:rollup2
AND.

03:03:13.382 --> 03:03:17.353 region:rollup2
ON THE SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT

03:03:15.251 --> 03:03:20.423 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED OUT HERE.

03:03:17.353 --> 03:03:23.259 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE I.

03:03:20.423 --> 03:03:26.062 region:rollup2
YOU GOT SIX.

03:03:23.259 --> 03:03:27.930 region:rollup2
YOU GOT SIX RECYCLERS.

03:03:26.062 --> 03:03:30.299 region:rollup2
IN TOTAL THAT RIGHT SIX ACROSS

03:03:27.930 --> 03:03:32.535 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

03:03:30.299 --> 03:03:34.270 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM.

03:03:32.535 --> 03:03:36.372 region:rollup2
ARE PRODUCING.

03:03:34.270 --> 03:03:37.840 region:rollup2
CLOSE TO THAT THE SEVENTY FIVE

03:03:36.372 --> 03:03:40.009 region:rollup2
PERCENT GOAL OF GETTING CLOSE TO

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:42.245 region:rollup2
MY RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT.

03:03:40.009 --> 03:03:44.647 region:rollup2
I NOTICE ONE.

03:03:42.245 --> 03:03:47.617 region:rollup2
OF THE SIX.

03:03:44.647 --> 03:03:49.552 region:rollup2
I LOOKS TO BE DRAGGING DOWN THE

03:03:47.617 --> 03:03:50.253 region:rollup2
REST WITH A WHAT I HAVE TO

03:03:49.552 --> 03:03:53.389 region:rollup2
SUGGEST AS AN ABYSMAL

03:03:50.253 --> 03:03:55.124 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE.

03:03:53.389 --> 03:03:56.926 region:rollup2
PART OF THE MANAGEMENT

03:03:55.124 --> 03:04:00.463 region:rollup2
PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.

03:03:56.926 --> 03:04:02.865 region:rollup2
IS TO.

03:04:00.463 --> 03:04:04.533 region:rollup2
ENGAGE RECYCLERS.

03:04:02.865 --> 03:04:06.435 region:rollup2
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO A

03:04:04.533 --> 03:04:08.571 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

03:04:06.435 --> 03:04:09.171 region:rollup2
ARE AND IF NECESSARY CHANGE THEM

03:04:08.571 --> 03:04:10.706 region:rollup2
OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE ENTIRE

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:12.375 region:rollup2

OF FIXING THAT PROBLEM.

03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:31.193 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THESE ARE FIXABLE

03:04:29.525 --> 03:04:32.028 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WE ARE WORKING WITH

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:33.863 region:rollup2

INCREASE THEIR RECYCLING.

03:04:33.863 --> 03:04:36.332 region:rollup2

OBJECTIVES.

03:04:40.336 --> 03:04:41.904 region:rollup2

SLIGHTLY.

03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:12.168 region:rollup2
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DRAGGING

03:05:09.031 --> 03:05:12.902 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE WHOLE OPERATION.

03:05:12.168 --> 03:05:16.172 region:rollup2

INNOVATIONS.

03:07:43.319 --> 03:07:46.655 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY. WE WERE CONCERNED

03:07:45.521 --> 03:07:48.457 region:rollup2
WHEN THE MATTRESS LEGISLATION

03:07:46.655 --> 03:07:49.058 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO MOVE AND BE PASSED

03:07:48.457 --> 03:07:51.127 region:rollup2
WITHOUT INCLUDING SOME OF OUR

03:07:49.058 --> 03:07:53.429 region:rollup2
KEY RECOMMENDATIONS.

03:07:51.127 --> 03:07:54.764 region:rollup2

THE BILL.

03:08:07.543 --> 03:08:11.113 region:rollup2
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS THAT

03:08:09.478 --> 03:08:13.315 region:rollup2
THE FEE MONEY WAS HANDED OVER

03:08:11.113 --> 03:08:14.316 region:rollup2
TWIN INDUSTRY GROUP WE BELIEVE

03:08:13.315 --> 03:08:15.851 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY OR

03:08:14.316 --> 03:08:17.353 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON HOW THEY COULD

03:08:15.851 --> 03:08:18.187 region:rollup2
USE THE MONEY.

03:08:17.353 --> 03:08:19.388 region:rollup2
OUR LETTER LISTED FIVE KEY

03:08:18.187 --> 03:08:21.357 region:rollup2
CONCERNS

03:08:19.388 --> 03:08:22.725 region:rollup2
FIRST THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

03:08:21.357 --> 03:08:24.693 region:rollup2
THE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY HAVE NO

03:08:22.725 --> 03:08:26.662 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD OF

03:08:24.693 --> 03:08:28.430 region:rollup2
THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM.

03:08:26.662 --> 03:08:29.431 region:rollup2
TO THE NEED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:30.533 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS TO LOCAL

03:08:29.431 --> 03:08:32.001 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND SOLID WASTE

03:08:30.533 --> 03:08:33.903 region:rollup2
FACILITIES FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED

03:08:32.001 --> 03:08:34.937 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROGRAM.

03:08:33.903 --> 03:08:36.739 region:rollup2
THREE THE NEED FOR CLEARLY

03:08:34.937 --> 03:08:39.308 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED RECYCLING GOALS TO

03:08:36.739 --> 03:08:41.443 region:rollup2
BE SET BY CAO RECYCLE RETURN

03:08:39.308 --> 03:08:43.012 region:rollup2
FORCIBLE AND NOT VAGUE.

03:08:41.443 --> 03:08:44.480 region:rollup2
FOR TO SHORTEN A DEADLINES TO

03:08:43.012 --> 03:08:46.749 region:rollup2
HOLD MRC ACCOUNTABLE FOR

03:08:44.480 --> 03:08:47.516 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE AND FIVE TO CLOSE A

03:08:46.749 --> 03:08:50.119 region:rollup2
LOOPHOLE IN THE DEFINITION OF

03:08:47.516 --> 03:08:50.719 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES MATTRESS RETAILERS TO

03:08:50.119 --> 03:08:51.954 region:rollup2
ENSURE THE FULL FUNDING OF THE

03:08:50.719 --> 03:08:53.088 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:08:51.954 --> 03:08:55.090 region:rollup2
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OF THE

03:08:53.088 --> 03:08:57.326 region:rollup2
LETTER WE STATED WE WANT TO

03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:58.294 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SB TWO FIVE FOUR AND

03:08:57.326 --> 03:08:59.628 region:rollup2
HOPETHAT YOU WILL CONSIDER

03:08:58.294 --> 03:09:01.297 region:rollup2
THESE AMENDMENTS IN THE SPIRIT

03:08:59.628 --> 03:09:02.698 region:rollup2
WITH WHICH THEY ARE GIVEN. TO

03:09:01.297 --> 03:09:04.133 region:rollup2
SIMPLY ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM

03:09:02.698 --> 03:09:05.100 region:rollup2
WILL WORK WELL.

03:09:04.133 --> 03:09:06.435 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS ALL WE WANT ARE

03:09:05.100 --> 03:09:09.171 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLY

03:09:06.435 --> 03:09:10.606 region:rollup2
FUNDED. OPERATED AND BY THE

03:09:09.171 --> 03:09:12.241 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PARTIES AND THAT

03:09:10.606 --> 03:09:13.509 region:rollup2
WORK AND I'M DELIGHTED TO HEAR

03:09:12.241 --> 03:09:15.010 region:rollup2
HOW WELL IT'S WORKING AND FRESNO

03:09:13.509 --> 03:09:16.245 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IS NOT THE

03:09:15.010 --> 03:09:19.315 region:rollup2
CASE FOR EVERY COUNTY. IN

03:09:16.245 --> 03:09:19.849 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BUT I'M REALLY GLAD

03:09:19.315 --> 03:09:20.149 region:rollup2
AND IT IS WORKING AND SOME

03:09:19.849 --> 03:09:21.917 region:rollup2
COMPANIES.

03:09:20.149 --> 03:09:23.219 region:rollup2
WHY MERCY HAS HAD THE SMOOTHEST

03:09:21.917 --> 03:09:24.720 region:rollup2
ROLL OUT OF ANY OF THE PROGRAMS?

03:09:23.219 --> 03:09:26.288 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS NOT WHERE

03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:28.090 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE FOR A BILL THAT WAS

03:09:26.288 --> 03:09:29.191 region:rollup2
PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN.

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:30.392 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE REASONS OUTLINED IN

03:09:29.191 --> 03:09:32.061 region:rollup2
THE LETTER OF THE BECAUSE OF

03:09:30.392 --> 03:09:33.596 region:rollup2
THESE CURRENT PROBLEMS SUCH AS

03:09:32.061 --> 03:09:34.830 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

03:09:33.596 --> 03:09:36.198 region:rollup2
ARE SOLID WASTE INDUSTRY ON THE

03:09:34.830 --> 03:09:36.932 region:rollup2
BOARD OF THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM

03:09:36.198 --> 03:09:38.267 region:rollup2
SO THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND

03:09:36.932 --> 03:09:39.935 region:rollup2
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE BE ABLE

03:09:38.267 --> 03:09:41.403 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH A BETTER.

03:09:39.935 --> 03:09:43.272 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE BEST WAY WOULD HAVE

03:09:41.403 --> 03:09:44.807 region:rollup2
BEEN FOR US TO HAVE NEVER GIVEN

03:09:43.272 --> 03:09:46.108 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FEE MONEY TO A BOARD THAT

03:09:44.807 --> 03:09:48.444 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIALLY.

03:09:46.108 --> 03:09:50.746 region:rollup2
THE SAME BOARD AS IT IS BY THE

03:09:48.444 --> 03:09:51.580 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS

03:09:50.746 --> 03:09:52.881 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION. WHO QUOTE FROM

03:09:51.580 --> 03:09:54.416 region:rollup2
THEIR WEBSITE WORKS HARD EVERY

03:09:52.881 --> 03:09:55.517 region:rollup2
DAY ON BEHALF OF US BUT MEMBERS

03:09:54.416 --> 03:09:57.119 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A STRONGER MATTRESS

03:09:55.517 --> 03:09:58.120 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY?

03:09:57.119 --> 03:09:59.822 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE SAME POTENTIAL

03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:01.123 region:rollup2
CONFLICT OF INTEREST WE HAVE IN

03:09:59.822 --> 03:10:02.558 region:rollup2
THE CORPORATE PROGRAM WHERE THE

03:10:01.123 --> 03:10:03.626 region:rollup2
CARPET AND RUG INSTITUTE MEMBERS

03:10:02.558 --> 03:10:05.895 region:rollup2
ARE BASICALLY THE SAME BOARD ON

03:10:03.626 --> 03:10:07.496 region:rollup2
THE CARE BOARD.

03:10:05.895 --> 03:10:09.131 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATION PASSED IN TWENTY

03:10:07.496 --> 03:10:10.766 region:rollup2
TEN AND TWENTY THIRTEEN ON P.

03:10:09.131 --> 03:10:12.735 region:rollup2
CARPET AND MATTRESSES.

03:10:10.766 --> 03:10:14.403 region:rollup2
A HYBRID POLICY APPROACH IS WHAT

03:10:12.735 --> 03:10:16.105 region:rollup2
IT IS MEANING THAT THE TO REDUCE

03:10:14.403 --> 03:10:18.207 region:rollup2
PRODUCER OPPOSITION TO THE

03:10:16.105 --> 03:10:20.209 region:rollup2
BILL'S. ALL OF THEM ELIMINATED

03:10:18.207 --> 03:10:21.910 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCER PAY PORTION.

03:10:20.209 --> 03:10:22.945 region:rollup2
INSTEAD TOOK CONSUMER FEES.

03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:25.047 region:rollup2
AND GAVE IT TO A PRIVATE SECTOR

03:10:22.945 --> 03:10:26.715 region:rollup2
ENTITY.

03:10:25.047 --> 03:10:28.751 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ENOUGH TRANSPARENCY OR

03:10:26.715 --> 03:10:29.718 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OUR OPINION.

03:10:28.751 --> 03:10:30.986 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THE MONEY IS ONE OF MY

03:10:29.718 --> 03:10:32.588 region:rollup2
FAVORITE SAYINGS BECAUSE IT

03:10:30.986 --> 03:10:33.856 region:rollup2
EXPLAINS A LOT.

03:10:32.588 --> 03:10:35.090 region:rollup2
IN THIS CASE HANDING PUBLIC FEE

03:10:33.856 --> 03:10:36.225 region:rollup2
MONEY TO OTHER STATE INDUSTRY

03:10:35.090 --> 03:10:37.660 region:rollup2
GROUPS WITHOUT ENOUGH CONTROLS

03:10:36.225 --> 03:10:39.128 region:rollup2
RISKY.

03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:40.696 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT OUT THE HARD WAY

03:10:39.128 --> 03:10:42.131 region:rollup2
WHEN PINK HERE USE THE FEE MONEY

03:10:40.696 --> 03:10:43.465 region:rollup2
TO SUE CAO RECYCLE BECAUSE THEY

03:10:42.131 --> 03:10:45.968 region:rollup2
DIDN'T LIKE THE REGULATIONS FOR

03:10:43.465 --> 03:10:47.303 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT. AND NOT ONLY PAID FOR

03:10:45.968 --> 03:10:49.505 region:rollup2
THE LAWSUIT BUT PAID FOR THE

03:10:47.303 --> 03:10:51.807 region:rollup2
APPEAL AND PAID FOR BOTH SIDES

03:10:49.505 --> 03:10:52.908 region:rollup2
INCLUDING COVER CYCLES PORTION.

03:10:51.807 --> 03:10:54.443 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT STEWARDSHIP

03:10:52.908 --> 03:10:55.778 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BASED OUT

03:10:54.443 --> 03:10:58.247 region:rollup2
OF STATE AND USE CALIFORNIA

03:10:55.778 --> 03:10:59.882 region:rollup2
MONEY. WHICH IS NOT THEIRS HAVE

03:10:58.247 --> 03:11:01.350 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY GOAL TO KEEP THE FEE

03:10:59.882 --> 03:11:03.319 region:rollup2
LOW ON THEIR PRODUCTS.

03:11:01.350 --> 03:11:05.387 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY MAXIMIZING

03:11:03.319 --> 03:11:07.323 region:rollup2
SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:09.425 region:rollup2
OR THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM.

03:11:07.323 --> 03:11:11.193 region:rollup2
AS EVIDENCE OF THIS MRC REDUCED

03:11:09.425 --> 03:11:13.429 region:rollup2
THE FEE AS THEY EXPLAINED LAST

03:11:11.193 --> 03:11:15.097 region:rollup2
YEAR FIFTY CENTS FROM ELEVEN

03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:16.899 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO ATTEND FIFTY A UNIT.

03:11:15.097 --> 03:11:17.1000 region:rollup2
WITH UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION FROM

03:11:16.899 --> 03:11:19.468 region:rollup2
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND THE

03:11:17.1000 --> 03:11:21.003 region:rollup2
CREW I ADVISORY COMMITTEE

03:11:19.468 --> 03:11:22.104 region:rollup2
RESPECT BY CAO RECYCLES DIRECTOR

03:11:21.003 --> 03:11:23.839 region:rollup2
AND REPRESENTS ALL THE

03:11:22.104 --> 03:11:25.274 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS OF THE STATE NOT

03:11:23.839 --> 03:11:26.809 region:rollup2
ONE OF US SUGGESTED THAT THIS

03:11:25.274 --> 03:11:29.078 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAPPEN.

03:11:26.809 --> 03:11:30.179 region:rollup2
SO HOW DID IT HAPPEN.

03:11:29.078 --> 03:11:31.213 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE BILL WAS WRITTEN SO

03:11:30.179 --> 03:11:32.514 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET COULD BE APPROVED

03:11:31.213 --> 03:11:34.483 region:rollup2
SEPARATELY FROM THE STEWARDSHIP

03:11:32.514 --> 03:11:37.653 region:rollup2
PLAN. AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE

03:11:34.483 --> 03:11:38.721 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HAVE NO POWER.

03:11:37.653 --> 03:11:40.222 region:rollup2
IF THE MONEY WAS BEING SPENT TO

03:11:38.721 --> 03:11:42.024 region:rollup2
ENSURE THE PROGRAM WAS WORKING

03:11:40.222 --> 03:11:43.092 region:rollup2
WELL FOR CALIFORNIANS.

03:11:42.024 --> 03:11:44.393 region:rollup2
THE RESERVE WOULDN'T BE THIRTY

03:11:43.092 --> 03:11:46.929 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS TWO YEARS INTO

03:11:44.393 --> 03:11:48.063 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM THERE IS A LOT TO DO

03:11:46.929 --> 03:11:49.598 region:rollup2
AND WE COULD HAVE SPENT THAT

03:11:48.063 --> 03:11:50.733 region:rollup2
MONEY ON MAKING SURE ALL THE

03:11:49.598 --> 03:11:52.801 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE GETTING THE SAME

03:11:50.733 --> 03:11:54.069 region:rollup2
SERVICE AT PRESENT WAS GETTING.

03:11:52.801 --> 03:11:56.305 region:rollup2
I POSE A QUESTION TO OUR

03:11:54.069 --> 03:11:57.406 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS. ASKING FOR STORIES

03:11:56.305 --> 03:11:58.707 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WAS OR WASN'T WORKING

03:11:57.406 --> 03:12:00.209 region:rollup2
WITH THE PROGRAM.

03:11:58.707 --> 03:12:02.544 region:rollup2
ONE RESPONSES FROM ALAMEDA

03:12:00.209 --> 03:12:04.413 region:rollup2
COUNTY A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WHO

03:12:02.544 --> 03:12:06.548 region:rollup2
WAS SO UPSET AT STILL SILLY SEEN

03:12:04.413 --> 03:12:08.217 region:rollup2
MATTRESSES ON THE STREETS HE

03:12:06.548 --> 03:12:09.718 region:rollup2
WANTS TO FIX THE LEGISLATION.

03:12:08.217 --> 03:12:11.453 region:rollup2
AND OTHER RESPONSES FROM THE

03:12:09.718 --> 03:12:13.155 region:rollup2
CITY OF DAVIS AND WE SHARED WITH

03:12:11.453 --> 03:12:14.990 region:rollup2
YOU THE PICTURES.

03:12:13.155 --> 03:12:16.091 region:rollup2
OF SO YOU HAVE THAT HANDOUT.

03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:17.860 region:rollup2
OF THE MATTRESSES THE PILOT

03:12:16.091 --> 03:12:20.129 region:rollup2
EVERY AUGUST WHICH IS NORMAL FOR

03:12:17.860 --> 03:12:21.797 region:rollup2
MOST UNIVERSITY TOWNS.

03:12:20.129 --> 03:12:23.465 region:rollup2
IT MRC SUSPENDED THEIR LARGE

03:12:21.797 --> 03:12:25.801 region:rollup2
VOLUME PROGRAM AN EARLY TWENTY

03:12:23.465 --> 03:12:27.269 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN WHICH SERVICE THE

03:12:25.801 --> 03:12:28.871 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES THE RETAILERS AND

03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:30.939 region:rollup2
THE HOTELS.

03:12:28.871 --> 03:12:33.075 region:rollup2
SO I MERCY STILL HAS NO PROGRAM

03:12:30.939 --> 03:12:33.776 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH UC DAVIS ANY

03:12:33.075 --> 03:12:35.144 region:rollup2
COLLEGE IN THE STATE OF

03:12:33.776 --> 03:12:36.378 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT PROGRAMS

03:12:35.144 --> 03:12:38.047 region:rollup2
REINSTATED.

03:12:36.378 --> 03:12:40.482 region:rollup2
SO ALL THE MATTRESSES IN THOSE

03:12:38.047 --> 03:12:41.884 region:rollup2
PICTURES THAT GO TO LANDFILL.

03:12:40.482 --> 03:12:43.285 region:rollup2
THEIR MANY MORE STORIES AND SOME

03:12:41.884 --> 03:12:44.753 region:rollup2
WILL TESTIFY TODAY SUCH AS DOWN

03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:46.055 region:rollup2
OR COUNTY.

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:47.289 region:rollup2
BUT IN SHORT THE PROGRAM IS

03:12:46.055 --> 03:12:48.757 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY NOT PROVIDING EACH

03:12:47.289 --> 03:12:51.360 region:rollup2
FEE PAYER.

03:12:48.757 --> 03:12:53.128 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REQUIRED BY LAW.

03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:54.897 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO RECYCLING NOR

03:12:53.128 --> 03:12:56.265 region:rollup2
PROVIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH

03:12:54.897 --> 03:12:57.266 region:rollup2
RELIEF FROM THE COSTS IN THE

03:12:56.265 --> 03:12:59.334 region:rollup2
BLADE FROM ILLEGAL DUMPING THAT

03:12:57.266 --> 03:13:00.469 region:rollup2
THEY WERE PROMISED.

03:12:59.334 --> 03:13:01.837 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SUPPORTED PAINT BECAUSE

03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:03.072 region:rollup2
THAT INDUSTRY AND WORK FOR TEN

03:13:01.837 --> 03:13:04.339 region:rollup2
YEARS WITH MULTIPLE STATE AND

03:13:03.072 --> 03:13:05.641 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DESIGN A

03:13:04.339 --> 03:13:07.009 region:rollup2
MODEL BILL?

03:13:05.641 --> 03:13:08.710 region:rollup2
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD START AND

03:13:07.009 --> 03:13:10.446 region:rollup2
IT STILL WORKS WE THINK THE BEST

03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:11.847 region:rollup2
OF ALL THE PROGRAMS TO DATE.

03:13:10.446 --> 03:13:14.149 region:rollup2
THE CARPET A MATTRESS BILLS WERE

03:13:11.847 --> 03:13:15.984 region:rollup2
MOVING FURTHER AWAY FROM THE

03:13:14.149 --> 03:13:17.619 region:rollup2
POLICY MODEL WE KNEW WOULD WORK.

03:13:15.984 --> 03:13:19.288 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL AND WE ARE STILL

03:13:17.619 --> 03:13:20.756 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR IN FACT HOW CALIFORNIA

03:13:19.288 --> 03:13:22.324 region:rollup2
WOULD GET OUR FEE MONEY BACK

03:13:20.756 --> 03:13:23.358 region:rollup2
FROM ANY STEWARDSHIP

03:13:22.324 --> 03:13:25.961 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION OF CAO RECYCLE

03:13:23.358 --> 03:13:27.162 region:rollup2
DISAPPROVED THE PLAN. AND AND

03:13:25.961 --> 03:13:27.663 region:rollup2
THERE WAS CHANGE OF AN

03:13:27.162 --> 03:13:28.931 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION RUNNING THE

03:13:27.663 --> 03:13:30.232 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

03:13:28.931 --> 03:13:32.000 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR

03:13:30.232 --> 03:13:33.368 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DAY BUT THAT WOULD KEEP

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.336 region:rollup2
ME UP AT NIGHT WORRYING IF WE'RE

03:13:33.368 --> 03:13:36.371 region:rollup2
GONNA GET OUR MILLIONS OF

03:13:34.336 --> 03:13:36.872 region:rollup2
DOLLARS BAC IF WE NEEDED TO

03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:38.707 region:rollup2
CHANGE OWNERSHIP OF THAT

03:13:36.872 --> 03:13:40.142 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:13:38.707 --> 03:13:42.478 region:rollup2
WHY WE APPRECIATE WHATEVER SCENE

03:13:40.142 --> 03:13:43.745 region:rollup2
HAS DONE AND WE DEFINITELY DO

03:13:42.478 --> 03:13:45.280 region:rollup2
AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM IN

03:13:43.745 --> 03:13:46.348 region:rollup2
FACT EVERY TIME I GO TO COMPLAIN

03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:47.583 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING I SHARE IT WITH

03:13:46.348 --> 03:13:49.651 region:rollup2
THEM SO THEY GIVE THE

03:13:47.583 --> 03:13:51.386 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT?

03:13:49.651 --> 03:13:53.288 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

03:13:51.386 --> 03:13:54.189 region:rollup2
FOR US AND PRODUCING THE FEE

03:13:53.288 --> 03:13:55.624 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE RECOMMENDATION OF

03:13:54.189 --> 03:13:57.059 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE ADVISORY COMMITTEE

03:13:55.624 --> 03:13:59.194 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PROGRAM IS NOT FULLY

03:13:57.059 --> 03:14:00.896 region:rollup2
ROLLED OUT. NOR WORKING WELL IN

03:13:59.194 --> 03:14:02.898 region:rollup2
SOME CASES TO US WAS JUST

03:14:00.896 --> 03:14:04.299 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE.

03:14:02.898 --> 03:14:06.902 region:rollup2
HERE'S MS KEY SUGGESTIONS FOR

03:14:04.299 --> 03:14:08.604 region:rollup2
MRC TO IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY TO

03:14:06.902 --> 03:14:10.439 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE.

03:14:08.604 --> 03:14:11.440 region:rollup2
ONE HIRE MORE STAFF AND GET

03:14:10.439 --> 03:14:12.841 region:rollup2
EVERY COUNTY THE SERVICE THEY

03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:15.144 region:rollup2
PAY FOR WE STILL HAVE A COUNTIES

03:14:12.841 --> 03:14:16.445 region:rollup2
WITHOUT SERVICE.

03:14:15.144 --> 03:14:18.046 region:rollup2
TO REINSTATE THE LARGE VOLUME

03:14:16.445 --> 03:14:18.947 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND FUND SERIOUS

03:14:18.046 --> 03:14:20.616 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL EFFORTS ON MARKET

03:14:18.947 --> 03:14:22.217 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT WE CAN'T PULL THINGS

03:14:20.616 --> 03:14:23.919 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE WAY STREAM IF WE HAVE

03:14:22.217 --> 03:14:25.854 region:rollup2
NO MARKET FOR THEM.

03:14:23.919 --> 03:14:28.123 region:rollup2
THREE ENCOURAGE RECYCLERS TO

03:14:25.854 --> 03:14:29.191 region:rollup2
FORWARD REBUILDABLE MATTRESSES.

03:14:28.123 --> 03:14:30.325 region:rollup2
TO ONE OF THE MANY MATCHES

03:14:29.191 --> 03:14:31.827 region:rollup2
RENOVATORS IN THE STATE FOR

03:14:30.325 --> 03:14:32.828 region:rollup2
HIGHEST AND BEST USE THAT WAS A

03:14:31.827 --> 03:14:34.029 region:rollup2
PROMISE OF THE BILL THAT WE

03:14:32.828 --> 03:14:34.563 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT HURT THE RENOVATORS

03:14:34.029 --> 03:14:36.265 region:rollup2
AND I'M HEARING FROM THE

03:14:34.563 --> 03:14:38.066 region:rollup2
RENOVATORS. THEY ARE BEING HURT

03:14:36.265 --> 03:14:39.501 region:rollup2
BY THIS PROGRAM AND MATCHES IS

03:14:38.066 --> 03:14:41.803 region:rollup2
THE COULD OF BEEN RENOVATED ARE

03:14:39.501 --> 03:14:43.038 region:rollup2
BEING RECYCLED INSTEAD.

03:14:41.803 --> 03:14:44.573 region:rollup2
FOR PROMOTE MUCH MORE HEAVILY

03:14:43.038 --> 03:14:45.674 region:rollup2
THE RETAIL TAKE BACK PROGRAM

03:14:44.573 --> 03:14:46.775 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S THE MOST

03:14:45.674 --> 03:14:48.343 region:rollup2
CONVENIENT IF MORE PEOPLE KNEW

03:14:46.775 --> 03:14:49.678 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT THEY WOULD ASK FOR IF

03:14:48.343 --> 03:14:51.847 region:rollup2
THE RETAILER AND PROVIDED.

03:14:49.678 --> 03:14:53.615 region:rollup2
FIVE IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE CAP

03:14:51.847 --> 03:14:54.983 region:rollup2
OF ONLY ALLOWING FIVE MATTRESSES

03:14:53.615 --> 03:14:56.785 region:rollup2
BE COLLECTED AND BROUGHT TO

03:14:54.983 --> 03:14:58.186 region:rollup2
RECYCLERS PER DAY WHICH IS

03:14:56.785 --> 03:14:59.922 region:rollup2
FORCING COLLECTORS LITERALLY TO

03:14:58.186 --> 03:15:01.657 region:rollup2
DRIVE ACROSS TOWN BECAUSE IT CAN

03:14:59.922 --> 03:15:02.291 region:rollup2
ONLY DROPPED FIVE YEAR AND THEY

03:15:01.657 --> 03:15:03.959 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DROP FIVE YEAR AND THEN

03:15:02.291 --> 03:15:05.160 region:rollup2
FIGHT HERE.

03:15:03.959 --> 03:15:06.695 region:rollup2
AND SIX IS TO INCREASE THE

03:15:05.160 --> 03:15:07.629 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT FROM THREE DOLLARS

03:15:06.695 --> 03:15:09.231 region:rollup2
PER MATTRESS RECYCLE TO A HIGHER

03:15:07.629 --> 03:15:10.866 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

03:15:09.231 --> 03:15:12.034 region:rollup2
THREE DOLLARS REALLY IS ENOUGH

03:15:10.866 --> 03:15:14.736 region:rollup2
FOR MOST PEOPLE TO COLLECT AND

03:15:12.034 --> 03:15:15.737 region:rollup2
RECYCLE MATTRESSES.

03:15:14.736 --> 03:15:16.738 region:rollup2
WE ARE REASONABLE BUT WE HAVE

03:15:15.737 --> 03:15:18.273 region:rollup2
HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR GOOD

03:15:16.738 --> 03:15:19.341 region:rollup2
REASON.

03:15:18.273 --> 03:15:19.808 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANT POLICIES AND

03:15:19.341 --> 03:15:21.877 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WORK FOR

03:15:19.808 --> 03:15:22.945 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY.

03:15:21.877 --> 03:15:24.446 region:rollup2
WE STUDY AND UNDERSTAND THE

03:15:22.945 --> 03:15:26.315 region:rollup2
DETAILS OF HIS POLICIES IN THEIR

03:15:24.446 --> 03:15:26.815 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION AND ARE ARE

03:15:26.315 --> 03:15:28.250 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO SHARE THESE

03:15:26.815 --> 03:15:29.918 region:rollup2
INSIGHTS.

03:15:28.250 --> 03:15:31.920 region:rollup2
WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIX EXIST

03:15:29.918 --> 03:15:33.522 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROGRAMS. AS OUR

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:35.057 region:rollup2
AFFILIATED ORGANIZATION THE

03:15:33.522 --> 03:15:36.625 region:rollup2
NATIONAL STORAGE OF ACTION

03:15:35.057 --> 03:15:38.994 region:rollup2
COUNCIL DID LAST YEAR WITH

03:15:36.625 --> 03:15:39.962 region:rollup2
CARPET AND AB ELEVEN FIFTY EIGHT

03:15:38.994 --> 03:15:41.396 region:rollup2
AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS

03:15:39.962 --> 03:15:42.898 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

03:15:41.396 --> 03:15:45.133 region:rollup2
WE HOPE WITH YOUR HELP TO PASS

03:15:42.898 --> 03:15:46.635 region:rollup2
NEW LAWS.

03:15:45.133 --> 03:15:47.903 region:rollup2
WITH HIGHER STANDARDS TO ENSURE

03:15:46.635 --> 03:15:50.038 region:rollup2
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS OF THESE

03:15:47.903 --> 03:15:50.672 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WILL WORK.

SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

03:15:50.672 --> 03:15:53.141 region:rollup2

TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT

03:15:58.080 --> 03:16:02.184 region:rollup2
THAT IS UNDER WAY AND. I'M KIND

03:16:00.983 --> 03:16:04.319 region:rollup2
OF RECOMMENDATION.

03:16:02.184 --> 03:16:06.288 region:rollup2
IS TO ALLOW THAT OUGHT TO

03:16:04.319 --> 03:16:09.057 region:rollup2
PROCEED AND THEN.

03:16:06.288 --> 03:16:09.992 region:rollup2
SEE WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

03:16:09.057 --> 03:16:12.928 region:rollup2
ARE AND THAT.

03:16:09.992 --> 03:16:14.596 region:rollup2
PRESUMABLY ACTED. ODD YOU HAVE

03:16:12.928 --> 03:16:16.298 region:rollup2
SOME COMMENTS ON THAT.

03:16:14.596 --> 03:16:17.766 region:rollup2
YES I THINK IT'S A GREAT THING

03:16:16.298 --> 03:16:19.501 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT GOOD

03:16:17.766 --> 03:16:21.470 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROGRAMS.

03:16:19.501 --> 03:16:23.605 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW

03:16:21.470 --> 03:16:25.173 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC MONEY IS IS BEING

03:16:23.605 --> 03:16:27.075 region:rollup2
GIVEN TO GROUPS THAT.

03:16:25.173 --> 03:16:28.777 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IN THIS LAW THEY

03:16:27.075 --> 03:16:30.512 region:rollup2
COULD PHARMACY SIX AND MOVE IT

03:16:28.777 --> 03:16:32.581 region:rollup2
FROM C. THREE WHICH IS A PUBLIC

03:16:30.512 --> 03:16:33.949 region:rollup2
BENEFIT CORPORATION TO A C. SIX

03:16:32.581 --> 03:16:36.018 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A MEMBERSHIP BENEFIT

03:16:33.949 --> 03:16:37.886 region:rollup2
ONLY ORGANIZATION. VERY

03:16:36.018 --> 03:16:39.521 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT UNDER IRS RULE MEANING

03:16:37.886 --> 03:16:40.756 region:rollup2
THEY COULD SEE THAT THE BENEFITS

03:16:39.521 --> 03:16:41.623 region:rollup2
OF THEIR MEMBERS IS REALLY NOT

03:16:40.756 --> 03:16:43.025 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE PROGRAM WORK THEY

03:16:41.623 --> 03:16:44.493 region:rollup2
DON'T LIKE IT. AND THEY COULD

03:16:43.025 --> 03:16:46.662 region:rollup2
SABOTAGE IT LEGALLY BE ABLE TO

03:16:44.493 --> 03:16:47.262 region:rollup2
DO THAT THESE ARE LITTLE FIXES

03:16:46.662 --> 03:16:48.830 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE LEARNED.

03:16:47.262 --> 03:16:51.300 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE DONE A WHOLE WHITE

03:16:48.830 --> 03:16:52.067 region:rollup2
PAPER AND HAD AN EXPERT ATTORNEY

03:16:51.300 --> 03:16:52.734 region:rollup2
DO A WHITE PAPER ON THAT VERY

03:16:52.067 --> 03:16:54.703 region:rollup2
THING.

03:16:52.734 --> 03:16:55.904 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE

03:16:54.703 --> 03:16:57.272 region:rollup2
LOCAL ORDINANCES AS WELL WHERE

03:16:55.904 --> 03:16:58.707 region:rollup2
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY HAD

03:16:57.272 --> 03:17:00.208 region:rollup2
FORMED A SISSY SIX AND THEY'RE

03:16:58.707 --> 03:17:01.610 region:rollup2
DELAYING WE THINK IT'S BECAUSE

03:17:00.208 --> 03:17:01.977 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACT FOR THE

03:17:01.610 --> 03:17:03.178 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFIT.

03:17:01.977 --> 03:17:03.945 region:rollup2
.

03:17:03.178 --> 03:17:06.048 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S LOTS OF LITTLE

03:17:03.945 --> 03:17:07.382 region:rollup2
NUANCES THAT NEED TO PROBABLY BE

03:17:06.048 --> 03:17:08.950 region:rollup2
TWEAKED WE LEARNED THIS OVER

03:17:07.382 --> 03:17:10.252 region:rollup2
TIME I MEAN THIS IS AND AS YOU

03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:11.386 region:rollup2
SAID IT'S A GREAT START.

03:17:10.252 --> 03:17:12.287 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE GOT IMPROVEMENTS TO

03:17:11.386 --> 03:17:13.422 region:rollup2
MAKE AND WE DO HAVE

03:17:12.287 --> 03:17:15.090 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE GETTING

03:17:13.422 --> 03:17:15.624 region:rollup2
THE SERVICE THEY'RE PAYING FOR

03:17:15.090 --> 03:17:17.659 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANTED TO WORK FOR

STILL A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN

03:20:04.292 --> 03:20:08.330 region:rollup2
OUR COUNTY? WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE

03:20:06.394 --> 03:20:10.298 region:rollup2

AND.

03:20:30.886 --> 03:20:32.954 region:rollup2
BUT WE WOULD REITERATE THAT THE

03:20:32.120 --> 03:20:34.489 region:rollup2
SPORADIC EVENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT

03:20:32.954 --> 03:20:36.424 region:rollup2
AND THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM REMAINS

03:20:34.489 --> 03:20:38.159 region:rollup2
SO WE LOOK FOR TO ENGAGING IN

03:20:36.424 --> 03:20:39.461 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IMPROVING

03:20:38.159 --> 03:20:43.098 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S RECYCLING PROGRAM

03:20:39.461 --> 03:20:43.698 region:rollup2
AND. AND LET OF THE FORTHCOMING

03:20:43.098 --> 03:20:47.669 region:rollup2
AUDIT AND OTHER EFFORTS THINK

03:20:43.698 --> 03:20:49.170 region:rollup2
IT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND

03:20:49.170 --> 03:20:50.972 region:rollup2
MISTER PATTERSON ESPECIALLY

THANK YOU FOR LETTING THE

03:20:50.972 --> 03:20:54.075 region:rollup2
HEARING GO YOU'VE BEEN VERY

03:20:52.541 --> 03:20:54.643 region:rollup2
GENEROUS ALLOWING EVERYBODY TO

03:20:54.075 --> 03:20:56.378 region:rollup2
GET THE VIEWS EXPRESSED WE

03:20:54.643 --> 03:20:57.512 region:rollup2
PERCEIVE THAT. I JUST WANTED TO

03:20:56.378 --> 03:20:59.047 region:rollup2
REMIND FOLKS OVER HERE IN THE

03:20:57.512 --> 03:21:00.115 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE OVER HERE FIVE YEARS

03:20:59.047 --> 03:21:01.316 region:rollup2
AGO WHEN S. B. TWO FIFTY FOUR

03:21:00.115 --> 03:21:02.784 region:rollup2
PASS. I KNOW BOTH OF YOU

03:21:01.316 --> 03:21:04.753 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WERE HERE AND

03:21:02.784 --> 03:21:06.521 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY VOTED FOR THE BILL.

03:21:04.753 --> 03:21:09.024 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A TWO THIRDS VOTE BILL.

03:21:06.521 --> 03:21:12.494 region:rollup2
WE HAD EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF

03:21:09.024 --> 03:21:13.094 region:rollup2
THE ASSEMBLY DEMOCRAT CAUCUS AND

03:21:12.494 --> 03:21:13.528 region:rollup2
THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS

03:21:13.094 --> 03:21:15.363 region:rollup2
WELL FOR THE BILL.

03:21:13.528 --> 03:21:16.898 region:rollup2
AND IN THE ASSEMBLY.

03:21:15.363 --> 03:21:18.400 region:rollup2
WE HAD OVER HALF OF THE

03:21:16.898 --> 03:21:20.035 region:rollup2
REPUBLICANS VOTE FOR.

03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:21.903 region:rollup2
AND THAT DESPITE THE FACT THE

03:21:20.035 --> 03:21:23.038 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL ATTACKED IT

03:21:21.903 --> 03:21:24.606 region:rollup2
AS A QUOTE TAX INCREASE IN THOSE

03:21:23.038 --> 03:21:25.407 region:rollup2
RECYCLING FEE.

03:21:24.606 --> 03:21:28.043 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY MENTIONING THAT

03:21:25.407 --> 03:21:29.544 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THERE WAS VERY BROAD

03:21:28.043 --> 03:21:30.712 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT

03:21:29.544 --> 03:21:32.213 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE PUT IN PLACE.

03:21:30.712 --> 03:21:33.615 region:rollup2
AND THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY TWO

03:21:32.213 --> 03:21:35.650 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD AND THEY'VE ALREADY

03:21:33.615 --> 03:21:36.751 region:rollup2
DIVERTED TO MILLION MATTRESSES

03:21:35.650 --> 03:21:37.352 region:rollup2
FROM LANDFILLS SO IT REALLY IS

03:21:36.751 --> 03:21:38.653 region:rollup2
WORKING TO MISTER PATTERSON'S

03:21:37.352 --> 03:21:39.287 region:rollup2
POINT.

03:21:38.653 --> 03:21:40.789 region:rollup2
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

03:21:39.287 --> 03:21:42.624 region:rollup2
OTHERS THAT ARE CONCERNED AND

03:21:40.789 --> 03:21:43.325 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IS NOT PERFECT.

03:21:42.624 --> 03:21:44.893 region:rollup2
AND THE.

03:21:43.325 --> 03:21:46.795 region:rollup2
BYE BYE MATCHES PROGRAM WILL

03:21:44.893 --> 03:21:48.630 region:rollup2
ONLY GET BETTER BUT IT'S CLEARLY

03:21:46.795 --> 03:21:50.031 region:rollup2
MET THE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE

03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:50.999 region:rollup2
SPOKEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS ON YOUR

03:21:50.031 --> 03:21:52.434 region:rollup2
FLOOR WHEN YOU VOTED FOR IT SIR.

03:21:50.999 --> 03:21:54.736 region:rollup2
AND WHEN TWO THIRDS PLUS OF YOUR

03:21:52.434 --> 03:21:55.937 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES DEAD. AND UP WORK YOU

03:21:54.736 --> 03:21:57.172 region:rollup2
KNOW I KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS

03:21:55.937 --> 03:21:58.907 region:rollup2
ONLY GOING TO GET BETTER WE

03:21:57.172 --> 03:21:59.975 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. AND WE

03:21:58.907 --> 03:22:01.242 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

03:21:59.975 --> 03:22:02.510 region:rollup2
TALK FINALLY I JUST WANT TO

03:22:01.242 --> 03:22:04.713 region:rollup2
MENTION ONE THING I'M ADVISED

03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:05.680 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS NO UNANIMOUS VOTE

03:22:04.713 --> 03:22:07.048 region:rollup2
BY THE MATTRESS ADVISORY

03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:08.583 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE SAYING. DON'T LOWER

03:22:07.048 --> 03:22:09.684 region:rollup2
THE FEE.

03:22:08.583 --> 03:22:10.952 region:rollup2
THEY WERE DARNED IF THEY DO AND

03:22:09.684 --> 03:22:12.387 region:rollup2
DARNED IF THEY DIDN'T THEY

03:22:10.952 --> 03:22:13.388 region:rollup2
DIDN'T LOWER BY FIFTY CENTS.

03:22:12.387 --> 03:22:15.256 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE A HIGH RESERVE

03:22:13.388 --> 03:22:16.558 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S A NEW PROGRAM THAT

03:22:15.256 --> 03:22:17.692 region:rollup2
STILL ROLLING OUT THAN THEY

03:22:16.558 --> 03:22:18.793 region:rollup2
WOULD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR THE

03:22:17.692 --> 03:22:20.528 region:rollup2
HIGH RESERVE LIKE OTHER PROGRAMS

03:22:18.793 --> 03:22:22.097 region:rollup2
OUT. SO IT'S A BALANCING ACT

03:22:20.528 --> 03:22:23.665 region:rollup2
THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS TAX MONEY

03:22:22.097 --> 03:22:26.835 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING THE BEST JOB THEY

03:22:23.665 --> 03:22:27.369 region:rollup2
CAN'T MANAGE EFFICIENTLY AND WE

03:22:26.835 --> 03:22:31.039 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUING

03:22:27.369 --> 03:22:33.174 region:rollup2
