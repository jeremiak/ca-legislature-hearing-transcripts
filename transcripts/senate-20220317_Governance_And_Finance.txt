I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE MOCK UP DISTRIBUTED MANY MEMBERS WHICH ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE'S COMMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. DESPITE DESPITE DECADES OF RHETORIC ON THE NEED FOR SAFER STREETS MOST CALIFORNIA STREET. HAD GROWN MORE DANGEROUS IN RECENT YEARS ACCORDING THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE THOUGHT NEARLY A 20% INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FATALITIES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. COMPARED TO THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SB NINE THIRTY TWO REQUIRES A COUNTY OR CITY TO INCLUDE IN ITS GENERAL PLAN A MAP OF THE HIGH INJURY NETWORK WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND FURTHER REQUIRES A COUNTY OR CITY TO IDENTIFY PRIORITIZE. AND IMPLEMENT SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS SOME ARGUE THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NOT CHEAP TO IMPLEMENT BUT HOW CAN YOU PUT A PRICE ON SOMEONE'S SAFETY OR A LIGHT. EVEN WITH THAT BEING SAID WE ARE COGNISANT OF THIS CONCERN IT IS OUR INTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CREATE AN ANNUAL GRANT PROGRAM TOWARD FINDING TWENTY COUNTY- CITY UPON COMPLETION OF THESE PLANTS. THESE PLANTS THAT HAVE CALMING MEASURES AS A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG WOMEN AND ADVOCATES CYCLIST MYSELF I'M SADDENED BY THE ALL TO COMMON TRAGEDIES THAT OCCURRED ON OUR STREETS. LIKELY JUST LAST WEEK I WAS ALMOST CLIPPED BY A CAR. AS I WAS WRITING UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE SEEMS LIKE EVERY THERE IS AN STORY IN THE NEWS. ABOUT A CYCLE INJURED OR KILLED. WE KNOW PEOPLE RUNNING TO CATCH A BUS ALSO FACED HARM'S WAY IN MANY OF OUR INNER CITY STREETS. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT JUST ABOUT CYCLISTS AS I SAID IT'S ABOUT THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE USING OUR STREETS SUCH AS THEIR CHILDREN WALKING TO SCHOOL OUR PARAGRAPH. GRANDPARENTS TRAVELING TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND OUR WORKERS CHASING A BUS. WE CAN HELP REDUCE TRAFFIC VIOLENCE WE CAN JUST BY HAVING. THE ABILITY TO BE BOLD ENOUGH TO ACT TODAY. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT COALITION OF- BY GROUPS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. AND TODAY I HAVE CLEARED ANG A VOLUNTEER ADVOCATE FOR STREETS FOR ALL WE CAN TELL YOU ABOUT HER EXPERIENCES WITH TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. AND I BELIEVE DAMIEN KEVIN.

GREAT THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS CLARA BANK AND I AM A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE MEMBER OF STREETS FOR ALL. OF SB NINE THIRTY TWO. I MUST CONSTITUENTS PORTANTINO. SENATOR I TRAFFIC VIOLENCE HELP IN FIFTY CORRECTIVE NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA IN LA SPECIFICALLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHAT THE DEBIT CARE THE TRAP OF VIOLENCE. IN THE CITY AND NEARLY TWENTY YEARS TO ME I WOULD RECOMMEND BY WHEN DRIVING AT A HIGH ALL TEXTING AND DRIVING I HAVE BEEN A FRACTURE OF MY RIGHT ARM UP NEXT PACKAGE TO BALTIMORE RIGHT WITH A FRACTURED MY LEFT ANKLE COMMANDED PNEUMOTHORAX IN THE KITCHEN MATIC PAINT. THE ENTRIES THAT POSSIBILITIES. SURGERY AND PHYSICAL THERAPY. CLEARLY NOT IMPACTED MY QUALITY OF LIFE. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT LIVE IN FEAR GOING OUTSIDE AND ENJOY THE MOMENT LIVE WALKING CYCLING AND EXERCISE OUTDOORS. SENATE BILL NINE THIRTY TWO WITH DR STEPHEN COUNTY EMPLOYMENT FIFTY IMPROVEMENTS THE TECHNICAL RESTAURANT TRAFFIC CALMING PLAN. WILL PRODUCE CALIFORNIA LIFE LOST INJURIES SUSTAINED THAT'S WHAT THE PORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND ASK FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NOW I'D LIKE TO ASK DAMIEN. KEVIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK. MY I. YOU NEED TO OPEN HIS LINE AS WELL. THE LINE IS OPEN. HELLO COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU KIND OF PORTANTINO COMMITTEE MEMBER- CONNECTION YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY IS THAT RIGHT THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY GREAT YOU LET ME SPEAK FOR JUST A FEW MOMENTS- MY NAME IS BEING IN CABINET AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER OF A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION CALLED STREETS ARE FOR EVERYONE- I STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION AFTER MY OWN AS WELL TRAGIC INCIDENT WHERE I WAS- CYCLING WITH MY WIFE IN GRIFFITHPARK A SEEMINGLY SAFE AREA THAT HIT HIM DOWNTURN THE CARD RACK THE QUARTER MILE FROM THE STREET TO GRIFFITH PARK ONTO AND DOWN THE FIVE FREEWAY FREEWAY SPEED. RIGHT LEG WAS OFF IN ABOUT TWO POUNDS OF FLESH IN TWO MINUTES WELL AS BROKEN BONES HOT LEVIN. I WALKED OUT THE BACK MY BICYCLE AND STARTED ON A CAMPAIGN FOR SAFER STREETS FOR SEVEN CALIFORNIA AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ST PAUL AND MANY OTHER- BICYCLE AND WALK- ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE- I REPRESENT NOT ONLY MYSELF AND MY ORGANIZATION BUT WE- WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF. OTHER VICTIMS OF TRAFFIC VIOLENCE ACROSS. THE-STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRIMARILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO NEED HELP WE PROVIDE FREE HELP AND SERVICES FOR THEM AND THEY BECOME ADVOCATES FOR SAFER STREETS. AND TO SAY THAT THE ISSUE OF TRAFFIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA. THE PROBLEM IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I SENATOR PORTANTINO BROUGHT UP THE LIVES ARE LOST IN AND THAT IT POINT IT IS POLITE THAT A LOT AND THOSE. THAT ARE. ALTER AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS. COMPLETELY THE COST BUT LET'S LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT COST. THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE REPORT FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. MEDICAL COSTS FOR TRAFFIC VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA IT FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS JUST FROM TRAFFIC PILOT FIVE POINT SEVEN NINE BILLION DOLLARS BUT IT COSTS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A BILL YET- COSTS FOR TRAFFIC COLLISION THAT REALIZE THIS IS JEFF THAT IS NOT INCLUDED. FIVE POINT EIGHT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. SO IMPLEMENT MEASURES THAT WOULD REQUIRE CITIES TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN PLANS TO MAKE SENSIBLE PLANS TO PREVENT THESE INJURIES- IF THE LOGICAL THING TO DO JUST REALIZED. IN THE TRAFFIC THE THEORY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY OF HOW TO MAKE THE STREETS SAFER IS KNOWN. THANK YOU KNOW HOW TO SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE YOU KNOW HOW TO- YOU KNOW SET UP A CELL PHONE OR WE SOME OF US TO- YOU YOU HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS SAVE LIVES ON THE STREET. AND IT'S NOT A MYSTERY THIS IS NOT SOME MYSTERIOUS THING HOWEVER IT DOES REQUIRE THE POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE BACK. END BY ACTUAL RESEARCH- THE CONCEPT MAKING THREE SAFER FOR ALL ROAD USERS IS SUPPORTED BY A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS TWENTY SEVENTEEN. RESEARCH POLL BY DAVID BENDER RESEARCH FOUND THAT. 78% OF CALIFORNIAN. THE STREETS BE MADE SAFER FOR ALL ROAD USERS NOW JUST CAR. AND THAT SIXTIES PERCENT OF. WANT BETTER CYCLE CONDITIONS SO. THAT MAKE USING A LOT MORE PEOPLE ON BICYCLES AND THAT WILL THIS THIS ON SEPT TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I CAN AND THAT EVEN- OF A CONCERN- IN TERMS OF THE BILL THAT ARE USING THAT- SO I PLEASE IMPLORE ALL OF YOU PLEASE VOTE ALL RIGHT FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR KEVIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AS AWFUL AS IT IS I REALLY APPRECIATE IT- WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF HEARING TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAY INSTITUTE TIME LIMITS ON TESTIMONY.

THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS ARE GONNA MOVE ON TO- THOSE IN OPPOSITION WANT TO CHECK IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION THAT IS PRESENT IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THAT WOULD LIKE TO GIVE TESTIMONY. WELCOME GOOD MORNING CHECK OUT WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- CHRIS WE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REGRETTABLY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION TODAY I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT WE CLEARLY AGREED WITH THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THIS BILL CITIES AND COUNTIES SUPPORT MAKING OUR STREETS SAFER FOR ALL ROAD USERS AND WE'RE INVESTING A LOT OF FLEXIBLE MAINTENANCE FUNDING INTO PROJECTS THAT NOT ONLY FIX OUR STREETS BUT I BIKE LANES AND PEDESTRIAN FACILITIES MAKE EIGHTY A COMPLIANT CURB RAMPS AND LOTS OF OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE LISTED OUT IN OUR OPPOSITION LETTER TODAY. THE THOUSANDS OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WITH FLEXIBLE SB ONE FUNDING SO WE DON'T HAVE A PRINCE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE SPECIFICS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND HOW IT'S DONE FIRST OFF WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF CREATING A NEW GRANT PROGRAM THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT UNMET FUNDING NEEDS THAT ALREADY EXIST ON THE SYSTEM SO WE'VE OUTLINED ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE UNMET NEEDS FOR OUR EXISTING COMPLETE STREETS FEATURES SIDEWALKS PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS BIKE LANES THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WE USED THE EXAMPLE FROM THE STANISLAUS COUNTY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS NON MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT IDENTIFIES TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF IMPROVEMENTS TO DO THESE TYPE OF PROJECTS IN THEIR JURISDICTION I DON'T THINK THAT PLAN ACTUALLY WOULD MEET THE VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN SB NINE THREE TWO BUT ASSUMING THAT IT DID AND WE MULTIPLY THAT AND SO TRIED TO GET A STATE WIDE ESTIMATE OF WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT'S OVER SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED RIGHT THERE. AND SO WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS BILL WE'VE TOLD THE AUTHOR WE GET WE AGREE WITH THE PRINCIPLE WE WANT TO HAVE UPDATES TO THE CIRCULATION ELEMENT THAT REALLY EMBRACE SAFETY AND MULTI MELISSA BUT THE TIME LINES IN THE BILL AND THE SPECIFIC- IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED NEED TO BE BASED ON A REASONABLY AVAILABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE IT CAN'T JUST BE FIFTEEN YEARS AND. YOU'LL DO THIS AND SO WE BY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT WE CAN A LANDINGS. THERE BUT THE TIME FRAMES THE SPECIFICITY AND THE NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION REALLY JUST ARE NONSTARTERS FOR US AND SO. WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES BUT TODAY. WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. A GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AREN'T ABLE ONCE YOU'RE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER- BUT ALSO JUST LIKE TO REALLY ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE AT C. SACK WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO- AGAIN REALLY DO SUPPORT THE GOALS OF THE BILL WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN- IMPLEMENTED AYE WHAT'S PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD BE PLACED IN THE- CIRCULATION ELEMENT. AND ALSO DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS OR WHAT THE LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THE BILL BUT AGAIN WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CENTER PORTANTINO AND FOR NOW WE ARE POSING AS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING TRACY RIGHT WITH ROCK RIBS AS A CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA. WELL THE REASON STATED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WHERE WE ARE ALSO OPPOSE MUST AMENDED. VERY GOOD. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE THAT WOULD. LIKE TO TESTIFY ELSE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED REMOVE TO THE- MODERATED MODERATED ARE THERE ANY INDIVIDUALS ON THE LINE IT WAS TO TEST AND WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. I HAVE ONE IN Q. VERY GOOD IF YOU COULD OPEN THOSE THAT THOSE LINES THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC. WITHOUT THIS MEMBERS OF THE TEAM THAT'S ONE THEN THE TIME- MY NUMBER. TOOK THE HEAD. MORNING PAYMENT CONKLIN WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. WELL WE SUPPORT- THE GOAL OF THE BILL I'D LIKE TO ECHO WHAT THE- THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED BY MY COLLEAGUES- THAT WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND- THAT AMBITIOUS TIME FRAME SUGGESTED BY THIS BILL BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DOCTOR AND SPONSORS. AND ON THE ISSUE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR. TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. I HAVE NO NO GOING TO BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- I DO APOLOGIZE THAT WE DO HAVE SOME UP PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ANNOUNCED THOSE AMENDMENTS AS WELL AS A MAJOR- CENTER PORTANTINO THAT THESE WERE THE AMENDMENTS WE HAD AGREED ON- ONE IS TO LIMIT NEW CAUSE OF ACTION TO THE LARGE NICE. LARGE THE NINE LARGEST COUNTIES AND SAN FRANCISCO. TO CREATE AN OFFRAMP THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT FIND THAT FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH DUE TO UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES OUTSIDE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTROL. GRAPHICS BILLION WE'RE BIKE LANES AND TRAFFIC TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES MUST GO. OUT MAKE IT A ONE TIME UPDATE DELAY IMPLEMENTATION BY A YEAR AND A HALF MADE BY. THE DATE IS JUNE. THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND NINETEEN IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE AND LIMIT THE APPLICATION ONLY TO THE URBANIZED AREAS- IS THAT BUT THAT WOULD YOU UNDERSTAND THIS TO PORTANTINO IT IS. VERY GOOD OVER THE BILL. THERE IS A MOTION AND AS AMENDED IS THERE ANY ARE THERE ANY DISCUSSIONS QUESTION TO MISTER PORTANTINO- SENATOR NELSON WELL SENATOR NEED THE BILL WOULD BE WELL INTENDED BUT I WILL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE IT'S TAKING US BACK TO THE WHOLE LONG TREND OF UNFUNDED MANDATES AND UNLIMITED LIABILITY. LAWYERS FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT THAT WILL COST THE LOCAL TAXPAYERS DEARLY SO I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL. SENATOR GAZA THE THANK YOU SENATOR- PORTANTINO. I DO WONDER IF YOU COULD BE SPONSORED SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THOSE IN OPPOSITION. INCLUDING THE CREATION OF THE GRANT PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW AT THE STATE THE IT'S A MANDATE- I THINK THAT THE BIGGEST- AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND READING IT THIS S ONE ELEMENT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT OR MORE FIXED TIME FRAME. CLEAR THAT UP I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD IT RIGHT BUT- THAT'S WHAT IT APPEARED APPEARED TO BE- THE DEFENSE AND ANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT THE OPPOSITION RAISED I WOULD APPRECIATE YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW WE ALL WANT SAFE STREETS WE ALL WANT- FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUTE TO WORK. WALK TO WORK FUNCTION IN OUR YOU KNOW. INTENSIFIED AND MANY CITIES HAVE HAD GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE PAST AND HAVE ADOPTED PLANTS- BUT FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO DO. IS TO ADD CITIES UPDATED GENERAL PLAN WHICH THEY HAVE TO DO- UNLESS TWENTY YEAR CYCLE- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- CREATE. LIKE PLANS DIFFERENT PLANTS AS PART OF THAT PROCESS. AS YOU KNOW I MADE THE FUNDING ELEMENT OF THIS ONE OF MY TOP. BUDGET PRIORITIES- FOR OUR SENATE CAUCUS BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE- WE SHOULD PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR GOOD INTENTIONS AREN'T SO. THERE IS A CORRESPONDING BUDGET ASK TO HELP CITIES OFFSET THE COST OF THIS. THE OTHER PIECE OF IT AS THE FOLKS ON THE LINE OF TALK ABOUT WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY WE KNOW WHAT WORKS WE KNOW IT DOESN'T WORK WE ALSO HAVE DATA TO SHOW WHERE IT'S NEEDED AND SO WITH THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS TO USE ALL OF THAT DATA AND ALL OF OUR KNOWLEDGE BOTH FROM THE COLLECTION SIDE AND THE ENGINEERING SIDE TO SAY LET'S IN MAKING IMPROVEMENTS WHERE THEY'RETHE MOST NEEDED BECAUSE AFTER WE HAVE THE MOST FRANKLY FATALITIES. AND SO IF YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES IF YOU HAVE THE PLAN IF YOU HAVE THE ENGINEERING AND IF YOU HAVE THE TIME. AND STILL ABOUT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE SO THEY SAID AGAIN. IF YOU HAVE THE PLAN. THE ENGINEERING. THE DATA AND THE TIME AND WE STILL DON'T USE ALL OF THOSE MECHANISMS. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEN THIS BILL IS GOING TO CREATE A RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK WE THINK THAT THAT WILL FRANKLY HELP. INSPIRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE THE TIME THE MONEY THE DATA AND THE ENGINEERING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT'S- NUMBER AT THE END OF THE TRAIL- AGAIN. I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID LOCAL GOVERNMENT I WOULD QUESTION SOMETIMES WHEN SACRAMENTO WOULD REQUIRE US TO DO THINGS UNFUNDED AGAIN THERE'S A CORRESPONDING BUDGET REQUEST. I WOULD SOMETIMES QUESTION SACRAMENTO WHEN THEY WOULD PASS THE PROBLEM ON TO US THAT THIS IS A LOCAL PROBLEM THIS ISN'T SACRAMENTO PASSING A PROBLEM ONTO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEREFORE THOSE LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE IT AND SO I THINK THIS IS A STRONG BILL TIME REQUIRES FUNDING USES ENGINEERING AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THE DATA TO UNDERSCORE SELF YES IT'S A TOUGH BILL BUT- AS I SAID IN AS THE FOLKS THAT TESTIFIED. IT'S TOUGH FOR FAMILY WHEN A LOVED ONE IS HIT BY A CAR RUSHING TO THE BUS IT'S TOUGH FOR FAMILY WHEN THE BREADWINNER IS. RIDING THE BIKE TO WORK IN. IT TOOK BY CAR- AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S NECESSARY SO I THINK I TOUCHED UPON ALL THE FILMS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY FRIENDS IN THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE. THE INPUT FROM THE CHAIR AND THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN- BASED ON THE CHAIRS AND PLAY AGAIN ANOTHER CHAMPION A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE WE'VE IMPROVE THIS BILL BUT KEPT ITS FRANKLY TOUGH FRAMEWORK IN PLACE BECAUSE THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS. SOME TOUGH LOVE. YOUR BROWSER DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YEAH I DIFFICULT THING ONE MORE THING I SUPPORT THE BILL OFTEN REFERRED TO KNOW. I DO WANT THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH I HAVE NOT. DONE SO YET IS TO CONSULT WITH CITY IN ALLENTOWN- SO HOPEFULLY THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION- IT'S FIVE A PENDING ISSUES. THAT ARE PUT TO THE- THANK. IF THERE ARE FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SENATE REPORT WOULD YOU LIKE THAT TO BE A CLOSE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND SACRAMENTO- THERE ARE SOME REALLY REALLY IMPRESSIVE- ENGINEERING DEDICATED BIKE LANES THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO- AND SO IT IT. AS IF SOMEBODY'S ON A BIKE A FOR TWO YEARS- AS I'M OUT THERE I LEARN MORE AND SEE MORE AND MY OWN COMMUNITY CAN DO BETTER THAN SACRAMENTO HAS DONE A GREAT JOB SO. WE SHOULD EMULATE THAT AND CONTINUE TO DO MORE THANK YOU EXPECT THAT FROM ABOUT.

THANK YOU VENTURE IN THE NUMBERS SAID ABOUT FOR THE VERY LATE THE PHARMACY PATRICK STADIUM THE MY FATHER WOULD BE PROUD THAT THE PUSH TO MEMBERS TO- PRESENT IN THIS BUILDING AT COMMITTEE AS I UNDERSTAND IT A TOYOTA MARKETS. THAT HONOR SAME PATRICK'S DAY IN. WELL WHY ANYWAY. THE SHOULD THAT HAPPEN TO THANK YOU- THANK YOU AGAIN THE INSURER AND CENTERS- I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN HUNDRED TO ENSURE ACCESSIBLE IT'S A PUBLIC MEETINGS ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THE MECHANISMS PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT DEAL WITH DISRUPTIONS DURING BOTH ACTED PUBLIC MEETINGS OR INSUFFICIENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND PUBLIC ATTENDEES CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH DISORDERLY CONDUCT DURING MEANS AT SUCH A HIGH MAGNITUDE. THE CRITICAL BUSINESS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AS A WHOLE HAS BECOME IMPAIRED ASSURED JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES THAT SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR SB ELEVEN HUNDRED I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD OF SIMILAR INSTANCES IN YOUR OWN DISTRICTS SAID IN ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE LOS GATOS MAYOR WE COULD A FAMILY AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY TELL COUNCILS FACE DISRUPTIVE. ACTIONS TARGETED. IN HER. THAT PUTS A PUBLIC MEETING INCLUDING ENTIRE L. G. B. T. THAT- API RHETORIC- THAT'LL- TO. AND BY THE VERY THREAT BEHAVIOR THIS YEAR. S. THE YOUR LINDA UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD HAD IN MULTIPLE MEETINGS PER WEEK. YOU TOO MANY DISRUPTIONS IN RECENT SELLABLE SURPRISE MEANS OF ALSO MADE NATIONAL HEADLINES IN PART DUE TO RACIST COMMENTS THIS WELL SO IT'S A BALANCE OF PERSONAL ATTACKS. BUT THAT ESSENTIALLY DISAVOWED THE PRESIDING OFFICER FROM CONTINUING THE MEETING WE MUST TAKE STEPS TO CLARIFY WHAT pBEHAVIOR SHOULD BE DEAN THIS IS DISRUPTIVE TO ENSURE THAT THIS DEFINITION IS ONLY USE WITH ABSOLUTE NEUTRALITY. FOR THOSE RARE OCCURRENCES AND PRIORITIZE THE CITY OF OUR OFFICIALS WHO SET A LOCAL. GOVERNMENT BODIES WAS A PUBLIC. WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY WILL GOVERNMENT PUBLIC FISH AS WELL AS CAN MEMBERS THE NEW FOR CLARITY ON THE FORTY OF LEGISLATIVE BY CAN ACT. IN REGARDS TO REMOVING AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S DISRUPTING THE PUBLIC MEETING. OR TO THE WIDE RANGE. OF DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS ABOUT WHAT THE DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF COUNCILS AND ATTORNEYS. IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE LOCAL AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. AS WE HAVE AN EE SEEN MANY TROUBLING INCIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING HARASSMENT THREATS OF VIOLENCE. HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE NEED TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC MEDIA ACCESS BY MODERNIZING THE BROWN ACT. SO THAT IT PROVIDES CLEAR STANDARDS AROUND NGUYEN REMOVAL OF THE MEDIA PER TO SPIT IS WARRANTED. HOW THAT HAPPENS AND WHETHER THIRTY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY CAN EXERCISE. AS A COMEDIAN ALSO STATES THE BILL THAT SETS UP A PROCESS REQUIRING MINIMUM GROUPS DISRUPT MEETINGS. BUT WHAT IT DOESN'T DO IS EXPLICITLY STATE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. WHEN IT INDIVIDUALS DISRUPTIVE. THE STATE. SHOULD SET A BARE MINIMUM IN UNIFORM STANDARDS BUT ESTABLISHING COMMONSENSE MECHANISMS DE ESCALATE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE STUDENT BODY TO RETURN TO THE IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL BUSINESS IN A SWIFT MANNER. THIS BILL WOULD HAVE PUBLIC ACCESS TO MINUTES. SB ELEVEN HER WILSHIRE SAFE OPEN ACCESSIBLE PUBLIC MEANS BY CREATING A PROCESS. TO RESTORE ORDER. WHEN DISRUPTIONS OCCUR PRESENT SAFEGUARDS. TO ENSURE IMPLEMENTATION CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES. SB ELEVEN HUNDRED THE MODERNIZE THE PRODUCT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR PRESENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SYSTEMS. BY SEXUALLY DOING THREE THINGS. FURTHER THE ENSURE INDIVIDUAL. WHO IN THE- FROM THE PUBLIC MEETING IF THE SERBS IN OR IN FEASIBLE THE ORDERLY BECAUSE- OF THE CONTINUING OF THE MEDIAN THE COURTS WITH THE LAW. SECONDLY CLARIFYING THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE MEETING FOR CAUSING A WOLF THE RUSSIAN. ESTABLISHING A WARNING SYSTEM TO REQUIRE THAT REMOVING INDIVIDUAL pWORLD FOR ELECTION BE PRECEDED BY A REQUEST THAT THE INDIVIDUAL COULD TELL THE DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR. ONE NOTE THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE A. C. L. U. AND OTHERS TO CROSS AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENT WITH FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES. AND HAVE EXPRESSLY STATED OR INTENT TO PROTECT CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND NOT TO PROHIBIT PUBLIC CRITICISM. I HAVE ACCEPTED BOTH OF THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE MINUTES- THEY ARE AS I UNDERSTAND THEM TO MAKE CLEAR THAT IS THE PRESIDING MEMBER BUT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY. THAT CAN REMOVE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR WOEFULLY INTERRUPTED THE MEETING THAT HE GETS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT. IT MAKE CLEAR THE DISRUPTIVE INDIVIDUAL GROUP OR GROUP HAS A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO IT HERE TO WARN BY CEASING THE DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR. WITH ME TODAY IS MAYOR ROB RENNIE LIVES IN THE TOWN OF US GOT US TO SPEAK AS WELL AS JEFFREY NEIL WEAPONS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES SEE SEX CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN.

JEFF NEAL I UNDERSTAND IT HERE IN PERSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU BUT CABALLERO AND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. I AM JEFF NEAL WITH CALIFORNIA'S ASSOCIATION OF- PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL AND THE SENATOR FOR. ADDRESS THE SIMPLE MATTER. AND BECAUSE THIS WOULD STRAY CLARIFIED DEATH. OF WHAT INTERRUPTION WHICH ALREADY IN THE ACT- IT BUT IT WOULD DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE HELP ENSURE THAT MY AGENT HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ENSURE SET SAFE. AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THERE'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE INCREASE AT REGRETTABLE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND THE VOLUME OF THAT DISRUPTIONS JUST OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS MALL- MANY OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE HAVE HAVE SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. MAKE SOME OF THESE MEETINGS WOULD BE UNRECOGNIZABLE TO YOU IN THE LEVEL OF VITRIOL THAT HAS BECOME. ALL TOO COMMON- IN THE CURRENT LAW- IS IT IS INADEQUATE TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION- SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AS AS THE CENTER SAID. THAT SOMETIMES BECAUSE THE LOCAL SAFETY OFFICERS HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW THEN THE PRESIDING OFFICER AND WE'VE HEARD OF CASES WHERE THE A SAFETY OFFICER IN THE ROOM HAS REFUSED TO EXPEL SOMEBODY- WHEN THE PRESIDING OFFICER HAS ORDERED IT- CITING- THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW. AND THIS WOULD. HELP TO ADDRESS THAT SITUATION. THE BILL WILL IMPACT ALL MEMBERS OF PUBLIC BECAUSE THE KIND OF BAD BUT- THAT'S BECOME A TOO COMMON IN THESE SITUATIONS KEEPS. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AWAY- WIN AT THESE THREATS ARE DIRECTED NOT ONLY AT ELECTED OFFICIALS NOT ONLY IT STAFF LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND ELECTIONS OFFICIALS BUT ALSO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH OPPOSING VIEWS. WHO THEMSELVES ARE THREATENED AND HARASSED AND BY SOME OF THE BELLIGERENT ACTORS. M. SO SB ELEVEN HUNDRED CREATES THAT HELPS PROVIDE THESE IMPORTANT TOOLS TO LOCAL OFFICIALS- THE COMMONSENSE TOOLS AND WE HOPE THAT- IT. DOES PASS THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP ADDRESS THE RISING TIDE OF HOSTILITY AND INTIMIDATION.

PASSABLE VERY GOOD- ANY OTHER COMMENTS SENATOR GRASSO. YES- SENATE KRITISIERT YOU COURSE- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN STOOD UP TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED- THIS IS A REALLY TOUGH TIME. WHEN THERE IS INCREASED VIOLENCE AND HOSTILITY AGAINST ELECTED OFFICIALS SO. I CAN IMAGINE. THIS HAS BEEN A VERY- DIFFICULT- ISSUE THAT YOU ARE TAKING ON BECAUSE- WE HAVE. SUCH INCREDIBLE RESPECT AND WE HONOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NONVIOLENTLY. STOOD UP AND SOMETIMES ALLOWED MYSELF TO GET ARRESTED- BUT NOT WITH THE INTENTION OF HURTING AND HATING AND- AND BECAUSE IN THAT KIND OF- JUST THAT KIND OF DISRUPTION. SO I JUST YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- THERE ARE THOSE OUT THERE. IN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS. I WOULD LOVE TO USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO STOP AND WATCH ANY KIND OF OPPOSITION SO JUST YOU KNOW WANTED TO BE A PRIEST TALK TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT RIGHT IN IN THE IN THE REMEMBERING THE GREAT BATTLES OF. THE UNITED FARM WORKERS AND- THE CONVENTIONAL HEARINGS- YOU KNOW DECADES AGO WHERE- TESTIMONY I WOULD PARAPHRASE IF I MAY UM BY. THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS- IN THE STATE- THIS TO THE FACT THAT- WE HAD TO ARREST PEOPLE- BECAUSE- OF THE WITH THINKING ABOUT CREATING A DISTURBANCE. IN A CLOSE BUDDY KENNEDY S. THEM TO RECESS AND GO READ THE CONSTITUTION UNITED STATES PRETTY PERSON AND- SO. IS BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE THESE BILLS BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGES IN OUR OFFICES- THE VERY FIRST THING I SAID TO MY OWN STAFF WAS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTENT BASED REGULATION IN THIS BILL- NOTHING IN THIS BILL REFERENCE. THE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SAY- WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS THE FOLKS THAT. WE SEE IT HERE WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN THIS IS OPEN UP THE PEOPLE WHO COME TO THE PODIUM. AND REFUSED TO LEAVE. REFUSE TO ABIDE BY THE LIMITS NO ONE ELSE CAN SPEAK- YOU KNOW UNLESS THERE'S A RECESS OR AND THAT'S WHAT IT CAN BE RESTORED I THINK MOST. GOVERNMENT BODIES ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LOCAL COUNCILS. ARE GOOD IT DIDN'T AFFECT WILL HAVE TO DEAL. WITH THAT- BUT- WE PUT SOME MORE CODE WILL SPIN IF YOU WILL THE PEOPLE THAT WE USE IN PIPELINES. THAT CODIFIED IN IS TO IS TO LIVE YOU DO EXAMPLE WHICH THAT. GREAT WORK OF THE COMMITTEE HERE THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN. IDENTIFIED. THE WHAT THE- OFFICER TO BE TO MAKE THAT CALL BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. IMMEDIATELY WITH THE DEVIL THIRTY DOLLARS THE CUTEST WHO. WHO TO CALL THE POLICE. IN CAN IMAGINE ANY OF US CAN IMAGINE COMPLETE THE THIS WORKERS THEY- SENATE WILL USE IT TO ONLY STORIES ABOUT THE- THAT HAPPENS IN THE GREAT CITY. SEPSIS OPEN TO TIME IT TURNS TRYING TO RESTORE WE WERE BOTH THAT OFFICIALS- BUT HAVE APARTMENT VOTE- AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO REACH. MEDIAN YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY IS. CHARGING THAT THE REFUSING TO LEAVE THE CLEANER THAT- CLEAN UP STRUCTURES INTO THE INTO THE SPACE THAT. THIS ABOUT PEOPLE FOR ME- SOON. OR HEARING TIMES WHAT'S GOING ON- WOULD THIS IS THAT IT'S NOT THE TO. US MMHM RESPECT THAT- WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH WHAT PEOPLE SAY BUT- THE FIGHT FOR LIFE SAID- THE IS ABOUT- PEOPLE WERE PURPOSELY WILLFULLY WILLFULLY THIS THE MEDIUM THE INTENTION. OF TO DISRUPT THE LEADING THE WAY THAT WOULD DISALLOW IT FROM GOING FORWARD GOOD CONNECTED SOME WAY OF OUR BUSINESS SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT VERY FINE LINE THERE THAT I THINK OF. A LOT OF FOLKS WHO'VE WORKED IN SYNTHETICALLY JOB CLEAN COMMITTEE STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT. THE WITH THAT THAT. MIDDLE THANK YOU. SENATE HERTZBERG. AS ONE OF UP ON THAT PROMOTED BECAUSE I. THE- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ENOUGH TO TAKE THIS LIGHTLY BUT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE YOU KNOW IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT WHEN OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES WROTE THE FAMOUS CASE ABOUT YELLING FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER. WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THIS DISTINCTION IN OUR CONSTITUTION. BETWEEN ACTION AND THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FORGET WHAT THE CONTENT IS. AND HERE YOU'VE GIVEN THE PERSON A REASONABLE CHANCE AND CLEARLY YOU'RE TRYING TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AND THE PEOPLE THAT THE MISSILE CARE INVEST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO TRYING TO INTERRUPT THE DEBATE IN LOS ANGELES AND- THAT THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO STOP IT. IT AND DOING THAT. YOU KNOW AND SO CERTAINLY PEOPLE RIGHT HERE RESTED IT RIGHT TO PROTEST IT RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR VOICE HERE YOU'VE PUT THE A REASONABLE BALANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE VARIOUS HISTORY OF THE CASES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THE END STATE SUPREME COURT ON DEALING WITH. THIS VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE BUT CONTENT. VERSUS ACT- I THINK YOU'VE PUT THOSE THOSE. THOSE GUARDRAILS IN HERE PUT QUITE ELEGANTLY. AND I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF. CHALLENGING BUT IT'S- RETIREMENT. TO TELL ME WE SAW UNITED STATES CENTERS WHICH OUT OF THE FLOOR GETTING BEAT UP WITH CANES AND WE SEE ALL KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN TO OUR HISTORY WE- TO ONLY FOCUS ON THE LAST THIRTY SECONDS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH OF HISTORICAL MEMORY. BUT IT'S BEEN A BIG. THE BILL CHALLENGE YOU KNOW THE IN AND BUT- AND WINDOWS POINTER HISTORY I THINK WHERE THIS IS THIS IS NECESSARY ND I THINK YOU'VE REALLY DONE ELEGANT JOB IN. REACHING A BALANCE THAT DEALS WITH THE IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SPEAK. IN EVERY. WAY POSSIBLE BUT WITHOUT. CHANGE DISRUPTING SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT AND THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. SENATE WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I- WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL THIS IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE- BUT IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I BELIEVE IN THIS COMMITTEE- THE CHAIR AND ARE ARE THE TWO MEMBERS WHOSERVE THE LOCAL. ELECTED OFFICE- BEFORE COMING HERE. AND ALONG WITH THE AUTHOR AND OF YOU KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT- SITUATION- AND IN MANY WAYS IT'S GREAT YOU ARE. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR COMMUNITY AND IT'S VERY ON THE GROUND AND- THAT'S INCREDIBLY ENERGIZING AND POWERFUL- BUT IT CAN BE EXTREMELY. INTENSE AND I THINK LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. VERY EXPOSED- IN IN WAYS THAT ARE GOOD BUT ALSO IN WAYS THAT ARE THE TIMES UNSAFE- AND THE HOST GOT MORE INTENSE OVER TIME. WHEN I WAS ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I REMEMBER PARTICULAR TIME WHEN WE WERE HAVING A VERY VERY INTENSE VOTE ABOUT WHETHER TO REMOVE A PARTICULAR- ELECTED OFFICIAL FROM OFFICE. FOR MISCONDUCT. AND WE ENDED UP NOT ACHIEVING THE HIGH THRESHOLD WE NEEDED TO DO THAT- BUT I REMEMBER- OF LATE AT NIGHT I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF. IF WE REMOVE THIS PERSON WHICH I SUPPORTED- WHICH I SUPPORTED- BUT IF IT HAPPENS WE'RE GONNA CHARGE THERE'S GOING. TO BE THIS CROWD IS GONNA COME RUNNING- THE GATE AND THE- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING TO HAPPEN IT WOULD NOT STATE. AND SO- IT IT IS- IT IS. REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT. ENHANCING DEMOCRACY ME VERY CLEAR YEAH ONE PEOPLE DISRUPTING PUBLIC MEETINGS. THAT'S NOT PROMOTING DEMOCRACY THAT IS UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY THE FIRST OF ALL AND IT'S DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE. ELECTED OFFICIALS SO THAT THEY DON'T THIS CHARGE THERE- AND DON'T REPRESENT THEIR COMMUNITY INTIMIDATION. AND IT CROWDS OUT AND INTIMIDATE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. WHO ARE SCARED THEY'RE OF THE PUBLIC WHO WILL LEAVE A MEETING. BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE AND THEY DON'T WANNA GET INTO IT WITH THE PEOPLE. AT AND SO IT IS THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR HURTS DEMOCRACY ANTI DEMOCRATIC THIS BILL ENHANCES DEMOCRACY BY MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE IN A SAFE WAY. I MET A LOT OF THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. AND NOT BEING INTIMIDATED TO DO OTHERWISE. VERY GOOD- YOU MAY ONE TO ADOPT THAT IS YOUR- I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID AND I THINK THE- THE IDEA OF THE CITIES HAVING A CO DISABILITIES IS REALLY IMPORTANT- WE DID THE SAME THING IT IN- IN OUR CITY AND- AND MADE IT VERY CLEAR WITHIN THE SPORTING EVENT SO PEOPLE WEREN'T FRIEDMAN- AND THEY WEREN'T FREE TO CLAP AND TO- HARASS AND- BOTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY CAME TO THE MIKE AND I THINK THAT. THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE TONE THAT WE HAD- BUT I UNDERSTAND- THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND IT'S GOTTEN MUCH WORSE- FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS AND- I THINK THIS THIS GIVES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AN OPPORTUNITY. TO WARN. AND THEN TO RESPOND AND TO KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE AS AS I SAID WHEN WHAT THAT. I THINK WHAT WOULD CENTER WINNERS AS QUICKLY YOU MIGHT WANT TO PUT THAT INTENT LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT THEN FRAMES THIS IN A PRETTY GOOD WAY. 86% TESTICULAR AND- I DO AGREE THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT. YEAH I DO AGREE. SO THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CONCLUDED HE DIED. AGAIN THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- ROBUST DISCUSSION HERE- AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE- HELP FROM THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND- WITH THAT I WOULD- AGAIN RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.
