INFORMATIONAL HEARING IT IS WEDNESDAY JANUARY THE THIRTIETH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS IS A JOINT MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. I'M HERE WITH -- THE WONDERFUL CHAIR OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE WHO WILL SAY A FEW OPENING COMMENTS SHORTLY. BUT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ON THIS TOPIC. ARE AN EXAMINATION OF X. CELERY DWELLING UNIT LAW AND POLICY ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA OTHERWISE KNOWN AS NOT JUST YOUR GRANNIES GRANNY FLAT. I THANK OUR THE HUMOR OF OUR STAFF FOR THAT -- LET ME JUST START BY SAYING WE ALL KNOW THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS THAT OUR STATE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED. AYE AND DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WE ARE ALL LOOKING FOR NEW AND INCREASE SOLUTIONS TO MORE HOUSING IN EVERY ONE OF OUR STATE -- IT WAS NOT LONG AGO THAT AT USED FOR A THIRD RAIL ISSUE AND BY THE WAY BY EXCESS REDRAWING UNITS WERE TALKING ABOUT -- UNITS. THAT ARE PART OF THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BUILDING OTHERWISE KNOWN AS IN LAWS OR GRANNY FLATS -- AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE. AS WELL AS BECAUSE HE THIS. THANK YOU SIR. IT WAS NOT LONG AGO THAT THESE UNITS WERE ILLEGAL ALMOST EVERYWHERE AND ECAUSE THEY DID EXIST -- THEY WERE OFTEN SUBSTANDARD -- AND WERE IN CONDITIONS THAT WERE HAZARDOUS I WILL TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO -- OUR CITY HAS HAD TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FORMALLY ILLEGAL IN LA UNITS ONE THE VERY FIRST BILLS THAT I INTRODUCED AS A LOCAL LEGISLATOR -- WAS A BILL TO LEGALIZE HE'S UNITS BUT AT THE TIME TEN YEARS AGO THIS WAS A VERY POLITICALLY FRAUGHT ISSUE. BUT IN RECENT YEARS EVERYONE'S PERSPECTIVE I AND AT THIS POINT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EIGHTY USE PART TECHNICALLY LEGAL -- BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CHALLENGES -- WHEN IT COMES TO ZONING AND OTHER POLICY CONCERNS AND THIS IS THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING? OUT WHILE WE HAVE HAD MANY CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING FORWARD THESE SORTS OF UNITS THERE BEEN OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN LESS SUPPORTIVE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY FEES DESPERATE FEES THROUGHOUT JURISDICTIONS -- THAT'S WE ARE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH AND UNDERSTAND THEIR MANY BUILDING CODES AND OTHER ISSUES THAT -- HAVE CREATED INCONSISTENCIES BOTH WITH LOCAL LAWS AS WELL AS WITH STATE LAW SO -- WHILE WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT POLICY TREATMENTS MOVING THIS FORWARD AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- GIVEN THE CHALLENGES ON THE GROUND WE WANTED TO HAVE THE HEARING TODAY TO REALLY EXAMINE THESE ISSUES -- AND BRING EXPERTS TO HELP US SHAPE. POTENTIAL POLICY SOLUTIONS IT WILL BE CONSIDERING THIS YEAR SO WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHU I'M ARE TO COMMITTEES TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS I EXPECT WE'LL BE DOING A LOT OF THAT AGAIN THIS YEAR -- ONE OF THOSE AREAS WE SEEM TO SPEND A LONG TIME UNLESS SHE WAS EIGHTY USE. A WHAT OCCURRED TO ME IN LOOKING AT THE MULTIPLE EIGHT SOME BILLS ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. OTHER BILLS DID NOT IN FACT HAD POLICIES THAT WERE CONTRARY TO EACH OTHER. CLEARLY THERE ARE DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ON HOW BEST TO APPROACH EIGHTY YOU POLICY CHANGES. I HOPE THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING HELPS EDUCATE OUR MEMBERS ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES LEADS TO MORE FRUITFUL DISCUSSIONS ONCE WE START TO HEAR BILLS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AS CHAIRMAN OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE I CONTINUALLY RAISE THE ISSUE OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL LEGISLATION THAT TREATS LOCAL AGENCIES THE SAME WHEN IN FACT EACH CITY OR COUNTY. CAN HAVE VERY DIFFERENT HOUSING NEEDS NEIGHBORHOOD FEEL COMMUNITY NEEDS TO PONDER FREE AND THE LIST GOES ON WHY SUPPORT STATE WHY GOALS TO TO INCREASE THE DEPLOYMENT OF EIGHTY USES ONE WAY TO HELP EASE OUR HOUSING. US SHORTAGE I ALSO SEE A NEED TO MAINTAIN LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THOSE GO GOALS ARE IMPOSED. I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS IN ADVANCE FOR TAKING THE TIME TO SHOW THEIR X. EXPERTISE ON WITH US ON THE EIGHTY USE. WE HAVE GREAT PANELISTS TODAY AND THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ACHIEVING EDUCATION ARC EDUCATION GOALS FOR OUR MEMBERS AND WILL NEED FUTURE CONVERSATIONS -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR SPEAKERS TO STAY AWAY FROM DISCUSSING ANY CURRENT LEGISLATION INSTEAD FOCUS ON POLICY ISSUES SURROUNDING EIGHTY USE. WITHOUT ALTERNATE BACK OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST PANEL GREAT LET ME JUST ASK IF ANY FAR COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY INITIAL COMMENTS. SCENE ON LET'S A ASK OUR FIRST. WITNESS. YES MISTER BLOOM HAS REITERATED THAT EIGHTY USER GUIDE. WHICH I THINK IS A CONSENSUS PERSPECTIVE OF ALL OF US HERE TODAY -- WE'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST SPEAKER TO REVIEW OF EIGHTY YOU LAW -- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE GREG NICOLAS. MISTER NICHOLAS. THANKS FOR THE HOUSEKEEPING. THEIR OWN ORDER LOOKS LIKE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GREG NICOLAS AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON EIGHTY YOU ISSUES SINCE LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. DEPARTMENT HOPES ARE COMMENTS WILL BE HELPFUL TO LEGISLATURE. ARE. A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY ON EIGHTY YOU CALIFORNIA EIGHTY YOU LAW WAS FIRST ENACTED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO EIGHTY LOS STARTED BY GIVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AUTHORITY TO PERMIT EIGHTY YOU'D DWELLING UNITS WITH THE CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT -- A DISCRETIONARY PROCESS THAT EACH CD NOW OFTEN CONSIDERS A CONSTRAINT ON DEVELOPMENT OVER THE YEARS LAWS CHANGE IN ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS. TO DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS PARKING AND UNIT SIZES -- BUT PAID CHANGES WERE PERMISSIVE IN LIKELY HAD LITTLE IMPACT THAT'LL CHANGE IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WITH THE PASSING OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX WHICH REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TWO MINUTES THEIR EARLY CONSIDER SECOND UNITS NOW EIGHTY USE WE GET ALL THOSE OTHER NAMES OFTEN. THIS IS A BIG SHIFT TO THE PRIOR DISCRETIONARY PROCESSES THAT INVOLVE PUBLIC HEARINGS IN THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS -- IN RESPONSE TO A BE EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX AGAIN BACK TO TWO THOUSAND THREE EIGHT CITY RECEIVE CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ADOPTED EDIE YOU -- ORDINANCES. WHICH WERE WHICH WERE SUBMITTED TO EIGHT CD -- THE CURRENT OVERVIEW OF THE EIGHTY LAW IN THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUE TO REFINE AND CLARIFY EIGHTY YOU LAW. ON THE LEGISLATURE'S TAKING A BIG LEAP IN ADDRESSING POTENTIAL LOCAL BARRIERS EXAMPLES INCLUDE PARKING IS IS A VERY LARGE. ONE HE CAN BE A HUGE FACTOR -- AFFECTING FEASIBILITY AND COST. EARLIER VERSIONS OF EIGHTY LAW ALLOWED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO EXCEED ONE PARKING PLACE FOR EIGHTY YOU BUT LAWS BEEN CHANGED TO MAXIMIZE PARKING FOR AN EIGHTY TWO ONE SPACE. UNLESS THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS -- THE AS WELL AS ALLOWING ALTERNATIVE PARKING SOLUTIONS FOR THE EXISTING PRIMARY DWELLING -- IF ANY DO YOU IS -- IS CREATED WITHIN THE EXISTING GARAGE THE ALTERNATIVES FOR PARKING FOR THAT PRIMARY DWELLING -- ARE ARE ARE MANY. I'M AT USE ARE EXEMPT FROM PARKING REQUIREMENTS ALTOGETHER IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS WHEN AN AT YOU IS -- IT WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO PUBLIC TRANSIT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO CANNOT ADJUST PARKING REQUIREMENTS BY BEDROOM WHICH WAS IN EFFECT IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NOW EIGHTY YOU PARKING IS ONE HER UNIT. REGARDING FEES IN SOME AREAS OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS FOR FEES FOR EIGHTY USED DESPITE. THE LESSER IMPACT OF THEIR FOOT PRINT COMPARED TO A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER A TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR TRAFFIC IMPACT FEE FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOME. HOW ABOUT THE IMPACT FEE FOR AN EIGHTY YOU NEAR TRANSIT? IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY ARE POTENTIALLY THE SAME THERE'S NO REDUCTION EVEN THOUGH. THE EIGHTY YOU MIGHT NOT BE REQUIRED TO HAVE PARKING. EIGHTY LAW NOW TAKES THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THE FEE ISSUE WITH EXEMPTIONS FOR UTILITY FACE WHEN EIGHTY USE CREATED WITHIN THE EXISTING STRUCTURE -- REDUCTIONS IN SEWER AND WATER FEES WHEN A NEW EIGHTY YOU STRUCTURE IS CREATED SUCH AS A NEW DETACHED. STRUCTURE IN THE BACKYARD WERE ATTACHMENT TO THE PRIMARY DWELLING. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS -- THERE ARE STILL WANTING TO CHARGE THE FULL FEE FOR SEWER AND WATER. THE THE LAW DID CHANGE FOR LAST YEAR INCLUDING SPECIAL DISTRICTS FOR SEWER AND WATER CORPORATIONS. TO ABIDE BY THE SAME REQUIREMENTS. EIGHTIES IN EXISTING SPACE OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF EIGHTY LAW ONLY ADDRESSED TO TYPE CITY TO USE AN ATTACHED IT'S ATTACHED TO THE EXISTING PRIMARY DWELLING. OR DETACHED STRUCTURE NOW LAW INCLUDES A THIRD CATEGORY THAT'S THE CONVERSION OF EXISTING SPACE LIKE A GARAGE CONVERSION OR RE PURPOSING A SPACE IN EXISTING HOME. SUCH AS A MASTER BEDROOM THE MIGHT ALSO BE DONE EIGHTY YOU. IN ADDITION HAVING THIS NEW CATEGORY THE LAW ALSO MITIGATE SEVERAL POTENTIAL BARRIERS MOST PROMINENTLY. LOCAL -- CRITERIA CURRENTLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I'M MAY DETERMINE WHERE AND HOW TO ALLOW EIGHTY USE. FOR EXAMPLE A LOCAL GOVERNMENTCOULD ALLOW EIGHTIES ONLY ON LARGE LOTS AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THAT. POTENTIALLY IMPACTING EIGHTY YOU CAPACITY. HOWEVER CURRENT STAY LAW ALLOWS FOR THE CREATION OF EIGHTY USE WHERE THERE IS A CURRENT. S. SINGLE FAMILY HOME ON A LOT -- AND THE EIGHTY WAS BEING MADE WITHIN THE CREATED WITH IN THAT EXISTING STRUCTURE. THESE CONVERTED SPACE AT USE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS -- ZONING REQUIREMENTS ETCETERA SUCH AS LOT SIZE HEIGHTS. UNIT SIZE SET BACK SUCCESS -- GARAGE CONVERGENCE MANY HOMES OF EXISTING GARAGES THAT MIGHT NOT TO MEET CURRENT SETBACK REQUIREMENTS DIRECTLY IMPACTING THE FEASIBILITY OF CONVERTING EXISTING SPACE HOWEVER. EIGHTY LAW NOW SPECIFIES THAT NO SET BACKS. ARE TO BE REQUIRED FOR AN EXISTING GARAGE WHEN IT IS CONVERTED TO AN EIGHTY YOU. OTHER THAN FOR SET BACKS FOR FIRE SAFETY -- REGARDING EIGHT CD REVIEW AUTHORITY -- EIGHTY YOU LAW NOW ALLOWS EACH CD TO REVIEW AND COMMENT ON EIGHTY ORDINANCES SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT PREVIOUSLY THE STATUTE ONLY REQUIRED EIGHTY ORDINANCES JUST TO BE SUBMITTED. TWO WITH THE DEPARTMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PUT HAVE GENERALLY BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE CHANGES AND EIGHTY LAW. AND THERE ARE MANY POSITIVE EXAMPLES OF INNOVATIVE OR EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO CLOVIS. TO SAN MATTEO COUNTY. DAN TO CINEMA COUNTY AS PART OF THEIR DISASTER RESPONSE. TO DATE EIGHT CD HAS RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED ADOPTED EIGHTY ORDINANCES IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT LAWS AND THOSE WOULD BE THE LAWS. AFFECTED THE FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WELL LESS THAN THE THREE HUNDRED ORDINANCES RECEIVED AS REQUIRED BY AB. EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX THIS NUMBER IS STILL A POSITIVE RESPONSE AND SOME LOCALITIES MAY BE SUCCESSFULLY FOLLOWING THE STATE STANDARDS. WITHOUT THE ADOPTION OF AN EIGHTY ORDNANCE. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THEY'RE STILL USING JUST THE STATE STANDARDS. ALL THE LOCAL AGENCIES ARE SUBMITTING THEIR ADOPTED EIGHTY ORDINANCES TO EIGHT CD THE ORDINANCES ARE POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE AVAILABLE TO ALL WITHOUT REVIEW. EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCES ARE ONLY REVIEWED TO ADDRESS. REPORTED POTENTIAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES FROM APPLICANTS ADVOCATES. AND OTHERS. ATVS EFFORT TO RUN AT Là GENERALLY FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REGULATION. ON INFORMATION THE DEPARTMENT HAS DEVELOPED A WEBSITE WITH RESOURCES IMPOSE ALL RECEIVED EIGHTY ORDINANCES AGAIN IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TO DATE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT COMPREHENSIVELY REVIEW ALL ORDINANCES RECEIVED AND MAINLY OPERATES. ONLY ON AN INQUIRER BASIS WHEN THE NECESSARY TIME CAN BE ALLOTTED. ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE DEPARTMENT PREPARED GUIDANCE IN THE FORM OF THE HANDBOOK WHICH I THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE. IN LATE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT ADDRESSED FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS INCLUDED A MODEL ORDINANCE FOR THE USE BY LOCAL AGENCIES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO RESPONSE TO CALLS FROM FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES TO DATE THE DEPARTMENT. HAS DOCUMENTED MORE THAN. ELEVEN HUNDRED INQUIRE IT'S AND I THINK WE HAVE A LOT MORE THAN THAT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THESE A PRIMARILY BEEN RECEIVED FROM PROPERTY OWNERS THAT IS THE MAJORITY. APPLICANTS DESIGNERS AND ADVOCATES BUT ALSO INCLUDES OFFICERS FOR OFFICES THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. EIGHTY WORKSHOPS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED FOR SEVERAL GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF FROM THE CHOOSE ME THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BUILDING OFFICIALS. THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REMODELING AND DIEGO COUNTY EIGHTY YOU STATUS CONFERENCE WHICH INCLUDED. LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND PLANNING MANAGERS. THE SANTA BARBARA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS. THE SOUTH CANDY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL SAN DIEGO. THE GATEWAY COUNCIL THE GOVERNMENT FOR PLANNING DIRECTORS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA AND OTHERS. ATV IS PROVIDING THE REVIEW SERVICES FOR DRAFT AT ORDINANCES AS REQUESTED BY LOCAL AGENCIES PRIOR TO ADOPTION AND I'D SAY WE PROBABLY. IT REQUESTEDBY LESS THAN A HALF OR LESS THAN A DOZEN. LOCAL AGENCIES TO REVIEW THEIR DRAFT ORDINANCE BEFORE THEY HAVE ADOPTED THE ORDINANCE. ON THE REGULATORY SIDE EIGHTY REVIEWS ADOPTED ORDINANCES AS COMPLIANCE CONCERNS ARE REPORTED BY APPLICANTS OR OTHERS AND PREPARES COMMENTS LETTERS TO INFORM LOCAL AGENCIES OF REVISIONS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. THESE LETTERS ARE AVAILABLE MODERATE CD WEBSITE JUST AS THE ORDINANCES ARE. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS IN EIGHTY LAW. THE REVIEW AND COMMENT AUTHORITY IS FAR DIFFERENT FROM EIGHTIES AUTHORITY TO REVIEW AND DETERMINE COMPLIANCE. AND IN FORETELLING ELLEN LET SUCH AS ENFORCING HOUSING ABOUT LAW. FOR EXAMPLE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST ADDRESS ATD FINDINGS TO BECOME IN COMPLIANCE. IN EIGHTY YOU LAW FINDING SOME COMPLAINTS WITH PROCESS. DOES NOT EXIST. AND THAT'S WILL RECAP ON THE HISTORY OF EIGHTY YOU. FOR COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS. WELL. IS QUIRK. SILVA ON THE EIGHTY YOU IT'S WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE UNITS. OF HOW HOW MUCH. PARKING IS REQUIRED DOES THAT MEAN THE UNIT OR THE BEDROOMS. NO IT -- IN FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HIM AND THAT CHANGE FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PARKING PLACES FOR AN EIGHTY YOU IS ONE PER UNIT. OKAY SO IF YOU HAD STATE. TWO SMALL BEDROOMS OR THREE YOU STILL ONLY NEED TO HAVE ONE THAT'S CORRECT UNLESS THERE'S AN EXEMPTION. FOR NINE SUCH AS IF THE AT YOU IS WITHIN HALF A MILE OF PUBLIC TRANSIT. THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU YOU WALK. BY THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ONE QUICK WHAT. IS THERE ANYTHING EXISTS EXISTING LAW THAT REQUIRES EIGHTY USED TO BE AFFORDABLE. IN NO SHOULD REQUIRE THEM TO BE AFFORDABLE NOT IN STATE LAW NO -- I BELIEVE I'VE SEEN ONE EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCE THAT ALLOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FEES IF THERE WAS A COMMITMENT FOR A DEED RESTRICTION ON THE PROPERTY. TO AND TO LOWER INCOME FOR A SET PERIOD OF TIME. THANK YOU YOU WALK. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER NICHOLAS I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPEAKING LATER ON THE PANEL BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU YOU CAN ANSWER NOW OR LATER IS. DO YOU SEE GAPS IN THE LAW THAT YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSING I KNOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES THAT WILL BE IT LIKELY PROPOSING. WHAT LEGISLATION THIS TERRY BUT JUST CURIOUS WHAT WHAT GENERAL TOPICS YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO FOCUS ON? WHAT? I DID GO THROUGH A FEW IN HERE AND THIS IS PEOPLE OFF THAT QUITE OFTEN AND THIS IS IF I HAD TO PICK THREE AT THE TOP. IT'S PARKING IT'S FEES AND IT MIGHT BE OWN OCCUPANCY. COULD YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON EACH OF THOSE TOPICS PARKING THERE ARE MANY JURISDICTIONS THAT BELIEVE THAT FOR INSTANCE A GARAGE FOR THE PRIMARY DWELLING -- IS EXIT IS NOT ALLOWED BY THAT JURISDICTION AND WHERE IT IS ALLOWED OR REQUIRED TO BE ALLOWED BY STATE LAW. AND AND THEN THE REQUIRED PARKING PLACES WE JURISDICTION THAT MIGHT REQUIRE FOR PARKING PLACES PER SINGLE FAMILY HOME -- BUT DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP A AN ENCLOSED PARKING STRUCTURE SUCH AS A GARAGE AND ONE A REPLACEMENT GARAGE -- THE OTHER IS IS DEFINITELY FEES IS THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING PRO RATED -- THAT -- EVEN THOUGH THAT SECTION OF LAW HAS BEEN IN THE FAX SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE MEDICATION IMPACT THE ACT. I KNOW OUR SECOND PANEL IS GONNA BE ON THIS TOPIC OF FEES BUT IT COULD YOU ELABORATE ALSO IN YOUR THIRD POINT. THANK YOU ARE HURT OWNER OCCUPIED UNITS. THAT'S PROBABLY TAPERED OFF A LITTLE BIT BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS WELL ACTUALLY SEA SALT LAW ALLOWS A JURISDICTION. TO REQUIRE THE OWNER TO BE AN OCCUPANT OF THE PROPERTY AND THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS THERE THE PEOPLE DIDN'T RESIDE THERE ALL THE TIME OR IF THEY WERE TO SELL THE PROPERTY. THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE TO FIND AN OWNER THAT WAS ALSO WILLING TO BE A FULL TIME RESIDENT TO THE PROPERTY -- AND THE SOME OF THE COVENANTS OR DEED RESTRICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SAY IF. THE PROPERTY OWNER DOES NOT RESIDE IN THE SITE THE EIGHTY YOU MUST BE REMOVED. A REDUCTION OF HOUSING IT. GREAT THANK YOU. AND ONE MORE QUESTION MISS QUIRK SILVA THE REVERSE OF WHAT -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY SAID SO -- THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE AFFORDABLE BUT ARE THERE INCENTIVES. OUT OR AVAILABLE EITHER THROUGH THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT TO HAVE WORK TO GIVE INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HUD'S. DOESN'T LA HAVE. NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THIS TIME -- IT WOULD BE A TO LOOK IT WOULD BE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE ONE IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD THAT PROVISION INCLUDED. IN THEIR IN THEIR ADOPTED ORDINANCE I DON'T KNOW OF OTHER PROGRAMS BY LOCAL AGENCIES. SITE I THOUGHT I HEARD EITHER GLENDALE OR LOS ANGELES WAS ACTUALLY GIVING THEM COMPLETELY WRONG LIKE SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HELP ENCOURAGE BUILDING OF A UT A PILOT PROGRAM. YES A PILOT PROGRAM THAT I BELIEVE IT WAS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ALL THE DETAILS OF IT BUT IT WAS REQUIRED TO AGAIN I THINK IT'S FOR PROVIDE. HOUSING FOR HOMELESS FOR A SET PERIOD OF TIME AND I THINK THE THE THE HE WAS OR THE THE GRANT WAS WAIVED AFTER. AFTER THAT THAT AMOUNT OF TIME FIVE YEARS HOUSING FOR HOMELESS. AND I BELIEVE IT WAS IT WAS A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF OF THE UNITS. THANK YOU. RIGHT. AT THIS TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY FELLOW COACH FELL CHAIR TO INTRODUCE EXPEL SO WE'D LIKE -- TO WELCOME THE THE PEOPLE THAT ON THE SECOND POUND TO COME ON UP WE HAVE THAMES. TIM SUIT SU FOR FROM MBA MANAGING DIRECTOR OF IN B. S.. WE HAVE DAVID GARCIA POLICY DIRECTOR FROM TURNER CENTER OF HOUSING INNOVATION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. BERKELEY. DAVID TOURING ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER AND DIRECTOR OF PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. AND SOPHIA -- FINANCE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. WELCOME. AND WE WILL KICK OFF A TIM PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY SURE [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. HI MY NAME IS TIM SIFFERT AND I'M WITH THE FIRM OF NBS. BEFORE I GET STARTED I WANT TO MAKE TO COMPLETELY UNRELATED DISCLOSURES IN THE IN THE CASE OF TRANSPARENCY. THE FIRST IS OUR FIRM WHICH BUT WHICH BEEN AROUND FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS WORKS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE ARE AT THAT WHAT I WOULD CALL A SORT OF TECHNICIAN IN TERMS OF FEES AND RATES AND CHARGES THAT KIND OF THING. AND THEN COMPLETELY SEPARATE ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WE INSTALLED AND EIGHTY YOU AND ARE SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO WE'VE HAD THAT FOR FIVE YEARS IT'S BEEN A GOOD EXPERIENCE -- PROVIDING BOTH INCOME FOR US IN A PLACE FOR AN OLDER COUPLE TO LIVE A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE GRAND KIDS. SO WITH THOSE TWO DISCLOSURES COME I'M GONNA GET INTO A LITTLE DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT FEES AND CHARGES AND SUCH. SO THERE ARE MANY TYPES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES AS AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE OF EVERYTHING FROM PLAN CHECK BUILDING PERMITS. DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES AND WATER OR SINCE -- SEWER CONNECTION FEES. THEY'RE ALL SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RULES -- BOTH LOCAL AND STATEWIDE -- SUCH AS AB. SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND ALSO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH WHICH YOU'RE PROPOSITIONS -- TWENTY SIX AND TWO EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION SOME LOCAL AGENCIES CHARGE ON GOING. RATES FOR THINGS LIKE WATER AND SEWER SERVICES. AND THOSE MAY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF COST FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND BY THE WAY WE WERE HAVING A DISCUSSION THIS MORNING ABOUT THE THAN THE NAME OF THIS -- DISCUSSION ABOUT PROVIDING FOR EXTRA SERVICES I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IS A IS A BIG PIECE OF THAT. AS WELL. SO THERE'S ALWAYS A COST BASIS FOR ANY OF THESE FEES OR RATES THAT ARE CHARGED BY A BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- UNLIKE PENALTIES AND FINES WHICH DO NOT HAVE TO BE COST BASED. SO OFFERED FOR SIMPLICITY I'M JUST GOING TO BREAK THIS DOWN INTO INTO THREE COMPONENTS -- THERE'S THERE'S THIS COULD BE AN ALL DAY DISCUSSION AND I WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY. SO THERE ARE. USER AND REGULATORY FEES. THERE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. AND THEN THERE ARE WHAT WE CALL HOOK UP FEES CONNECTION FEES FOR UTILITIES BUT THEY WERE DOES HURT THAT THIRD GROUP IS REALLY IN A WAY A SUBSET OF OF THE SECOND GROUP OF DEVELOPING IMPACT FEES AND SUBJECT TO A LOT OF THE SAME. SO THE RULES AND AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED PRACTICES. SO IN TERMS OF THAT CATEGORY ONE USER AND REGULATORY FEES THERE THEY REPRESENT COST RECOVERY OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- THEY MAY NOT EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AND REASONABLE COST FOR PROVIDING THE SERVICES -- LOCAL AGENCIES SHOULD HAVE AN EXPRESS SET OF POLICIES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WOULD LIKE -- TO REFLECT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND GOALS IN TERMS OF COST RECOVERY SOME MAY BE 100% SOME MAY BE AT 50% FOR VARIOUS POLICY GOALS -- USER FEES ARE VOLUNTARY AND THEIR IMPOSE ON THE PAIR BASED ON THAT PAYERS ACTIONS SUCH AS TAKING A RECREATION CLASS OR PULLING A BUILDING PERMIT. NOT REGULATORY FEES -- OUR OUR INVOLUNTARY RIGHT BASED ON IN AGENCIES ABILITY TO REGULATE AND THOSE COULD BE ALONG THE LINES OF LIKE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS ON CERTAIN -- COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES FOR FIRE RELATED -- REASONS. SO THE SECOND GROUP IS THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES WHICH WERE WHICH WERE MENTIONED BY GREG -- I'LL JUST A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE DEVELOPING LAND -- FOR OFF SITE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF RIGHT. THERE ARE VARIATIONS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA BASED ON LOCAL -- POLICIES AND AND CONDITIONS SOME COMMUNITIES AS WE KNOW HAVE EXTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES THEY LITERALLY RANGE FROM PARKS. TO CHILD CARE FACILITIES. OTHERS HAVE A FEW OR NONE -- FOR MANY DECADES NOW THE GENERAL MANTRA HAS BEEN THAT DEVELOPMENT SHALL PAY ITS OWN WAY -- IF A LARGE DEVELOPMENT IS COMING INTO A A A TOWN. THERE IS THERE IS A NEXUS THERE IN TERMS OF THE MORE DEVELOPMENT WOULD CREATE A NEED FOR MORE PARKS. MORE ROADS GREATER CAPACITY IN THEIR WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM RIGHT. FOR EXAMPLE PARK IMPACT FEES AND QUIMBY FEES ARE USED -- TO FINANCE BOTH LAND ACQUISITION FOR AN NEW PARK LAND AS WELL AS PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE -- ON THOSE PARK LANDS AND WE WANT TO KEEP THE RATIO OF PARKS TO PEOPLE INTACT IF YOU WILL -- EXAMPLES THOUGH OF LOCAL CONTROL WE CAN LOOK -- TO WHERE I LIVE THE CITY A SAN FRANCISCO DOES NOT HAVE A CITY WIDE PART IMPACT FEE. BUT THE TOWN OF WINDSOR IN THE NORTH BAY DOES. THEY HAVE UP CITY WIDE ONE THAT BOTH FUNDS PARK LAND ACQUISITION AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS TO THOSE. TO THOSE PARKS IT'S BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF DEVELOPMENT AND A LOT OF ALGEBRA TO DIVIDE OUT THE COSTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. SO THE THIRD CATEGORY WHICH WE CALL CONNECTION FEES SOMETIMES ARE CALLED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES. AND THESE ARE AGAIN A KINDLE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES BUT THEY ARE BASED MORE ON THE OFF SITE CAPITAL COSTS FOR THE CURRENT SYSTEM. OR EXPANSION TO MEET ADDITIONAL DO ALL [inaudible] THEY OFFSET. TO SOME DEGREE GENERAL RATE INCREASES FOR WATER AND SEWER. RIGHT YOU CAN EITHER GET IT UP FRONT OR YOU CAN GET OVER TIME. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE OF FOUR FOUR THINGS WHEN IT LOOKED WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES ORCHID FOR CONNECTION FEES. IS THAT THEY MUST SHOW A NEXUS OR CONNECTION. WHAT IS THE FEE CHARGED FOR AND WHAT DO YOU GET? YOUR MUST DEMONSTRATE PROPORTIONALITY AND THAT THE COST WILL BE DOCUMENTED AND BE PROPORTIONAL. THEY NEED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN PROCEDURES FOR ADOPTING AND THERE'S A PROTEST PROCESS. AND THEY MUST BE REASONABLE AND SHOW THE RELATIONSHIP. SO UNLIKE OFF SITE CAPITAL PERMITS THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE -- A WATER UTILITY WILL ALSO CHARGE SORT OF ON SITE CONNECTION FEES. AND THE MOST TYPICAL ONE YOU SEE IS -- IF YOU'RE ADDING AN AD YOU ARE AN ADDITIONAL UNIT THEY'LL CHARGE I'M A METER FEE. IN IN MANY COMMUNITIES THAT METER FEE IS DRIVEN BY CONSERVATION. NOT NECESSARILY. TO YOU KNOW KEEP OUT NEW UNITS IF YOU WELL -- THEY REALLY IN IN SOME COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE MONTEREY AREA WATER IS SO DEAR THAT THEY'VE HAD. THESE ADDITIONAL METERS REQUIREMENTS FOR MANY MANY YEARS. SO IT TO GET A LITTLE MORE GO VERY BRIEFLY INTO HOW A CALCULATION CAN WORK FOR CAPACITY FEE. SO IN THEIR SIMPLEST FORM THESE CAPACITY FEES OR A SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES ART ART MAR MERELY CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE COSTS ALLOCATED TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF NEW DEVELOPMENT ANTICIPATED. OVER A CERTAIN TIME FRAME. SO YOU CAN HAVE THE CASA PLAN FUTURE FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS. AND THEN LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF NEW UNITS. SO -- THE CAPACITY FEE REVENUES THEN CANNOT BE USED FOR ANNUAL OPERATIONS SO THEY CANNOT BE USED FOR THE PROVISION OF WATER SEWER THAT KIND OF THING. BUT THEY REALLY -- ARE IMPORTANT THAT YOU DON'T EXCEED -- THE ACTUAL COST OF COURSE. SO THE METHODOLOGIES YOU CAN USE ARE EITHER ONE THE FIRST ONE IS. LOOKING AT THE VALUE OF THE SYSTEM IN PLACE NOW OR WHAT'S CALLED THE HISTORICAL OR BY IN METHOD IF YOU WELL YOU'VE GOT A SYSTEM. AND YOU JUST DIVIDE THAT OUT. THE OTHER OPTION IS TO LOOK AT PLANNED INCREMENTAL GROWTH AND INCREMENTAL UNITS WHETHER THEY'RE NEW HOMES OR OR HIGHRISES OR A OR A TO USE SO YOU THAT'S CALLED THE INCREMENTAL OR SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. AND THE LAST ONE IS A COMBINATION OF THE TWO APPROACHES AND YOU SYNTHESIZE THE TWO TOGETHER -- THIS COMBINATION APPROACH REQUIRES NEW CUSTOMERS TO PAY BOTH THEIR FAIR SHARE OF EXISTING. SYSTEM ASSETS AS WELL AS THEIR SH FUTURE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH CAPACITY BASED ON THE FORECASTS FOR THAT WATER SYSTEM. AS A RESULT THE NEW CUSTOMERS CONNECTING WOULD ENTER AS EQUAL PARTICIPANTS. AND WITH REGARD TO THEIR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT AND OF OBLIGATION SEATED HILLARY. MANY LOCAL AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA IF NOT ALL RELY ON A NATIONAL PUBLICATION BY THE AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION. CALLED MANUAL M.. ONE IT'S WIDELY AVAILABLE AND IT'S PROBABLY ON THE BOOKSHELF OF ALMOST EVERY -- PRACTITIONER IN THE WATER RATES -- WORLD OR OR SOME TEN GENTLE AREA. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW SOME OF THESE FEES ARE CALCULATED THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PROPORTIONAL BASED ON THEIR TAXATION NO PUN INTENDED OF THE SYSTEM. THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE BUYING INTO OR OR CONNECTING UP -- TO ALL OF THESE FEES THAT I MENTIONED REQUIRE A LOGICAL ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO DETERMINE THEIR COST BASIS. THE LOOK THERE ARE LOCAL VARIATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BUT THEY SHOULD GENERALLY REFLECT -- GENERALLY EXPECT ACCEPTED PRINT -- THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. SO THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD THAT I ASK MYSELF AS DOES DOES THE ADDITION OF AN EIGHTY YEAR REQUIRE A NEW CONNECTION OR MAYBE IT'S JUST A MERELY A TIE IN TO THE EXISTING LINE. TO THEY MAIN AND NOT SUFFICIENT TO TAKE CARE OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE AND EIGHTY YOU OR DO THEY NEED TO UP SIZE. SO THOSE SORT OF GRANULAR DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE -- ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS SOMETIMES. WILL A LARGER CONNECTION BE REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONAL LIVING AREA IS A METER REQUIRED FOR ANY UNIT OR EIGHTY YOU. WILL AND EIGHTY YOU GENERATE ADDITIONAL DEMAND FOR PARKS AND SCHOOL FACILITIES. AND IF SO. WHO WILL PAY FOR THAT AND HOW WOULD THOSE BE PAID? FOR I'M THE TAKE AWAY THAT I DID WANT YOU TO TO LEAVE WITH A KNOWS A LOT OF INFORMATION SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IS THAT -- THE FEES ARE SHOULD BE COST BASED -- IN THE IN THEIR CALCULATION AND THEY SHOULD ALWAYS FOLLOW GENERALLY ACCEPTED METHODOLOGIES. USING -- THE LOCAL COSTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. SO THAT IS MY VERY QUICK TREATISE OF A TOPIC THAT WE USUALLY HAVE HOURS FOR SELF. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE DO IT DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TO HIM. I HAVE ONE THIS COMES OUT -- ARE THERE DIFFERENCES HOW A CITY -- WILL SET RATES VERSUS A SPECIAL DISTRICT. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I WAS REVIEWING -- GREG NECKLACES -- A MEMO THAT HE JUST HANDED ME A LITTLE BIT AGO THAT IN THEORY THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CITY EN ESPECIAL DISTRICT. BUT THERE ARE OFTEN DIFFERENCES AND IN PRACTICE BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY OF OF CONTROL AND LAND USE. AND THAT KIND OF THING BUT IN THEORY A CITY IN A SPECIAL DISTRICT SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE SAME. LEVEL OF SERVICE BUT A SPECIAL DIS CANNOT CHARGE AN IMPACT FEE. IF THE CITY DOES NOT WANT TO COOPERATE AND WE SEE THAT OFTEN WITH. WE SHOULD UP WITH FIRE DISTRICTS BUT IT CERTAINLY COULD BE. THE SAME WITH A A WATER DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE -- DAVID GARCIA. FROM DAVID. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS MORNING MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AND I'VE BEEN ASKED -- TO JOIN THIS HEARING THIS MORNING TO DISCUSS SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH ON EIGHTY USE WITH REGARDS TO FEES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT EIGHTY USE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT PART IN ALLEVIATING THE STATE'S HOUSING DEFICIT. THEY ARE INHERENTLYLESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD THE ARE DRIVEN BY INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND THEY FIT NEATLY INTO OUR EXISTING LAND USE PATTERNS AND TO THAT LAST POINT. OF THE TURNER CENTER ACTUALLY RECENTLY RE RELEASED THE RESULTS OF A YEARLONG STATEWIDE SURVEY THAT EXAMINED VARIOUS LAND USE PRACTICES AND POLICIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FROM THAT SURVEY IS THAT ABOUT OWNED EXCLUSIVELY FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND SO THANKS TO RECENT REFORMS TO EIGHTY USE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF NEW HOUSING IN THESE AREAS WITHOUT OPENING UP A SINGLE ACRE OF NEW LAND. TO DEVELOPMENT -- SO SO AGAIN I WAS AS WE HAVE DONE AND WHAT WE CAN TELL WITH REGARDS TO FEES AND SO I APPROACH THIS QUESTION IN TWO WAYS THE FIRST IS. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT CITIES ARE CHARGING -- HOMEOWNERS TO CREATE EIGHTY USE AND FROM THERE WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FEES IN OUR ABILITY TO BUILD THE STRUCTURES IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO TO THE FIRST QUESTION WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON WHAT'S USER CHARGING AND WE DO KNOW THAT IT DOES VERY GREATLY DEPENDING ON THE CITY AND COUNTY THAT. YOU ARE IN -- THE SURVEY THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER -- INCLUDES A WHOLE SECTION ON EIGHTY YOU POLICIES AND PRACTICES INCLUDING A QUESTION ON WHAT LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING HOMEOWNERS. FOR CALM EXCUSE ME FOR EIGHTY USE. AND FROM THE RESPONSES WE RECEIVED FROM THIS QUESTION WE KNOW THAT THE MEAN. AMOUNTS CHARGE PER UNIT FOR AN EIGHTY YOU IN CALIFORNIA IS EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FURTHERMORE WE KNOW THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR RESPONDENTS NOTED THAT THEY CHARGE MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER EIGHTY YOU WE ALSO -- WE ALSO SAW A FEW EXAMPLES OF CITIES REPORTING THAT THEY CHARGE UPWARDS OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT AND SOME CLOSE TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SURVEY REFLECT ONLY RESPONSES FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES AND WHAT THEY CHARGE. AND SO ANY CHARGES THAT ARE LEVY SIX OR TO THE DISTRICTS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THOSE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE NUMBERS THAT WE SAW IN THE SURVEY. AND AS A RESULT -- HOMEOWNER WHO IS GOING TO THE EIGHTY PROCESS NOW IS ALMOST CERTAINLY EXPERIENCING HIGHER FEES WILL WE HAVE REPORTED. ANOTHER INTERESTING TAKE AWAY FROM OUR SURVEY IS THAT THE QUESTION REGARDING WHAT LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING FOR USE. WAS BY FAR THE HAD THE LOWEST RESPONSE RATE OF ANY QUESTIONS IN THE EIGHTY YOU SECTION ONLY ABOUT 50% OF RESPONDENTS CHOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR THAT QUESTION WHICH PERHAPS TELLS US THE CITY'S DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A A GOOD FEEL. FOR WHAT THEY'RE CHARGING FOR THE SPECIFIC TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT AND THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON OUR SURVEY. AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT -- FEES CAN MANY TIMES BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO A HOMEOWNER LOOKING TO BUILD A UNIT IN THEIR BACKYARD. AGAIN AT USE OUR INHERENTLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD HOWEVER IF THEY ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FEES THAT'S SAY A SINGLE FAMILY HOME OR AN APARTMENT UNIT MAY BE SUBJECT. TO THAN A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THAT PROJECTS BUDGET IS GOING TO GO GOING TO DEVICES HOMEOWNERS FROM PURSUING -- THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN EIGHTY YOU. KNOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT IN PLACES WHERE EIGHTY YOU FEES HAVE BEEN WAIVED OR LOWERED. THAT A INCREASE IN APPLICATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION PERMITS SOON FOLLOWS A FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CITY OF PORTLAND. TWENTY TEN THAT CITY RECOGNIZE THIS IMBALANCE AND DECIDED TO WAIVE THEIR EIGHTY YOU FEES AND IN SUB SCHOOL YEARS SAW -- OF SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF EIGHTY USE THEIR TO THE POINT WHERE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY OF PORTLAND ISSUED MORE PERMITS FOR EIGHTY USE THAN SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THAT CITY. WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE SANTA CRUZ IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL OTHER EIGHTY REFORMS ARE THEY LOWER THEIR FEES AND HAVE SINCE SEEN AN INCREASING USE THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL. MORE RECENTLY THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. LAST SPRING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR IMPACT FEES FOR YOU TO USE A GOING FROM -- BETWEEN 240-002-29000RADIO DOWN AND STAFF THEIR NOTES THAT SINCE HIS REFORM WAS ENACTED EIGHTY YOU APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED SO THESE THESE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES -- I THINK WE WILL HEAR ABOUT A FEW MORE -- OF CITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR MORE HOUSING WITH THE AMOUNT OF FEES THEY CHARGE FOR EIGHTY USE SO. AGAIN WE KNOW THAT FEES ARE OFTEN TIMES CITED BY HOMEOWNERS AS A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER -- FOR WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL DECIDE TO BE. AND IN PLACES WHERE WE SEE DECREASES OR WAIVERS FOR FEES WE DO SEE AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION OF THOSE PLACES SO -- I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING TIME TO EXAMINE THIS TOPIC AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSION. SO AMERICA EXCELLENT. ON THE EITHER COUNTIES OR CITIES THAT LOWERED THEIR FEES WAS THAT A COUNTY OR A CITY DECISION -- SO. THE SURVEY REFLECTS RESPONSES FROM EITHER A CITY OR COUNTY OR IN INSTANCES WHERE THE CITY IS THE COUNTY -- AND SO IN IN THOSE INSTANCES IT WOULD BE CITIES REPORTING THEIR OWN FEES THAT THEY CHARGE FOR A TO USE AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY HAVE DECIDED TO LOWER THOSE FEES THAT WOULD BE -- FOR THE FEES THOSE CITY SPECIFICALLY CHARGED THERE MAY BE OTHER FEES AT THE COUNTY CHARGES OR PERHAPS -- OTHER DISTRICTS CHARGE THAT THE CITY DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT THOSE HE'S MAY STILL EXIST [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA. MISTER SEE FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS IN FOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE CITY SAN DIEGO AND THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING TO THEM TO TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE WELL IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS YOU ARE GIVING US THE 800-025-0000. RANGE OBVIOUSLY QUITE FAR THAT'S ON THAT CITY AND COUNTY FEES WHAT ABOUT -- ANY OTHER -- REVIEW OR AM I THINKING PUTTING THE FROM MY DISTRICT THE COASTAL COMMISSION PLAYS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THIS -- ONE OF THOSE FEES LOOK LIKE IF ANY IS THERE ANYONE WORK ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE -- THAT'S A EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I WOULD SAY THAT -- OUR SURVEY CAPTURED ONLY -- CITIES AND COUNTIES SO AGAIN -- ANY OTHER -- ENTITY THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO LEVY FEES -- THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED ARE SERVING AS A RESULT I'M NOT ONLY ARE HOMEOWNER SUBJECT TO THE FEES THAT CITIES ARE CHARGING BUT THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ENTITIES THAT MAY BE CHARGING FEES ON TOP OF WHAT CITIES DOING AS WELL. MINDFUL IT HAS TO BE WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE RIGHT SO -- MAYBE NAY FOR FOR FOR FOLLOW UP CERTAINTY. JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT I REMEMBER LAST YEAR AND SOME DISCUSSION AROUND HUSING FEES THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY THAT THERE ARE JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE THAT HAD. COLLECTED FEES TO BE SIX FIGURES JUST FOR THE FEES NOT FOR CONSTRUCTION DOES AT JIVE WITH YOUR ANECDOTAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS. YEAH I I I HAVE SEEN ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT'S IN CERTAIN. LOCALITIES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FEES CAN AND COMPRISE PERHAPS EVEN 50% OF THE WHOLE COST TO DEVELOPING EIGHTY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE. OF EIGHTY YOU -- THAT HOMEOWNER IS PRETTY THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT PERHAPS GOES BEYOND A EIGHTY USE IN THAT SAID THE AUTHORITY THAT IS GRANTED TO CITIES TO SET THEIR FEES ACTUALLY QUITE BROAD. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE VARIATION THAT YOU HAVE ACROSS THE STATE WHERE YOU HAVE SOME CITIES THAT THEY HAVE THESE ARE QUITE LOW WHERE YOU WHERE YOU HAVE OTHER. CITIES THAT HAVE FEES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE MUCH HIGHER. IN I KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO -- ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES - MISTER GRAYSON FROM THE CITY CONCORD AT PASSED A LAW REQUIRING A LOOK AT ALL FEES ACROSS ALL JURISDICTIONS IN MY HOPE IS IN THE COMING MONTHS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT. VERY GRANULAR INFORMATION BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK I HEARD FROM YOU WAS AT HALF THE CITY'S DID NOT RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION ON WHAT THE FEES WERE SO IT IS VERY POSSIBLE. THAT THERE CITIES CHARGING VERY SIGNIFICANT FEES AND YOU JUST DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THAT DATA. I THINK THAT'S THE AFFAIRS OPTION THIS OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GARCIA -- PRECIADO TESTIMONY IN WILL MOVE ON TO DAVID CONE -- IN I THINK IT PRINTS OUT RIGHT WELCOME AND I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY SINCE THE FIRES RAVAGED A YOUR AREA SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ATTENDING TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY SANTA ROSA AND SO WE WE WE ARE POPULATION AS PER PERSPECTIVE ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE -- FIFTH LARGEST CITY IN THE BAY AREA. AND WE ARE AS MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA HAS HOUSING SHORTAGE -- AFTER THE FIRES WE TURN IT BECAME EXASPERATED TO A POINT WHERE WE HAD A CRISIS ON OUR HANDS SO WE TOOK A VERY AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO HOUSING. ACROSS THE BOARD AND EIGHTY USE BEING ONE OF THOSE TOOLS WE PUT INTO PLACE AND SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE THE ELEMENTS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE THE STATE -- HELP GIVE US THE PLATFORM. TO LAUNCH AND JUMP INTO THIS THIS WORLD A LOT QUICKER -- SO THE POLICY THAT DEALT WITH PARKING -- AND OTHER THINGS THAT THE STATE PUT IN PLACE -- WE THEN TOOK THAT INFORMATION WENT OUT TO OUR PUBLIC DID PUBLIC MEETINGS HAD AN ENORMOUS RESPONSE FROM OUR PUBLIC HUNT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP TO THE PUBLIC MEETINGS. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS LOCALLY TO BUILDING EIGHTY USE AND CAME UP WITH THREE THINGS PARKING SETBACKS AND COST THE COST INCLUDING FEES BUT ALSO CONSTRUCTION AND TIME TO GET THIS GIG EIGHTIES BUILT. US WHAT WE DID IS -- BROUGHT ALL THOSE -- THOSE COMMENTS TOGETHER I'M JUST LIKE WE AS WE MADE AT LOCAL YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MY VISIT AND HE PUT IN PLACE PUT MORE. AND SO WHAT WE DID IS -- DRESSED FEES -- AND WE WE WENT THROUGH AND DETERMINE ANYTHING SEVEN FIFTY FIVE SQUARE FEET OR LESS WE WERE GONNA REDUCE THE FEES DRAMATICALLY SO YOU JUST HEARD OUR FEES WERE IN THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. FOR EIGHTY YOU -- THEY NOW ARE AT SEVEN FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THEY WENT FROM TWENTY TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS -- THERE IS A GRAPHIC BELIEVE THAT WAS IN YOUR PACKET THAT WE PUT TOGETHER TO SHOW THE IMPACT OF WHAT THOSE FEES WERE WE WERE SEEN BETWEEN. THREE TO EIGHT EIGHTY YOU APPLICATIONS A YEAR AFTER THE STATE LAW INTO EFFECT THAT ADDRESS PARKING AND SETBACKS -- WE SAW A SLIGHT INCREASE ONCE WE REDUCE THE FEES WE SAW FAIRLY DRAMATIC INCREASE OR UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTEEN EIGHTY USE THIS YEAR ARE BACK IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE EXPECT THAT TO RISE AGAIN NEXT YEAR. OF THE OTHER INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS IS WE PUT THIS POLICY THE PLACE VERY QUICKLY AFTER THE FIRE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE REBUILD. AND WE WORKED WITH DEVELOPERS SHOWED ON THE POLICY PUT THESE -- PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND DIVERT AND AS PEOPLE ARE REBUILDING THEIR HOMES ARE LOOKING AT ADDING EIGHTY USED TO THEIR REBUILD SO THE PREMIUM ABOVE THE GARAGE. DIRECTION INCREASING HOUSING STOCK WITH THE REBUILD SO JUST THIS GRAPH SHOWS THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ADDED THIRTY NEW UNITS WE WOULD HAVE HAD -- AT AS PART OF THE REBUILD BECAUSE OF THE THE OTHER WE DID A DRY EARLIER IN THE CON ABILITY COUNSEL DIDN'T IT WAS IT WAS INPUT FROM OUR COMMUNITY -- THAT WE DO HAVE EITHER YOU EITHER YOU HAVE TO LIVE IN ONE OF THE UNITS IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN ONE OF THE UNITS YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AFFORDABILITY CONTRACT -- THROUGH OUR HOUSING AUTHORITY A SO THAT WAS THE TRADE OFF TO SAY WE'RE WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE BUT WE WANT TO TRY TO GET SOMETHING FOR OUR COMMITTEE WHICH IS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WEEKS WE DESPERATELY NEED -- SO THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL LOCALIZED THING WE PUT ON TO IT. ON THE SECOND THING THAT ARE THE THIRD THING WE'RE TRYING WE'RE GONNA BE ADDRESSING THIS PROCESS. SO WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE REBUILD IS THAT WE CAN TERM PLANS AROUND VERY QUICKLY WE CAN DO PRE APPROVAL PLANS -- WITH RIGHT NOW WE'RE APPROVING PLANS AND FIVE DAYS FOR REBUILD -- IN IN A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- COME UP WITH US FOR MASTER PLAN FOR PLANS OF WHAT THESE UNITS LOOK LIKE PRE PROVEN THAT WE CAN APPROVING OVER THE COUNTER SERENA TAKE THAT. KNOWLEDGE THAT WE LEARNED FOR THE REBUILD PROCESS APPLY THAT TO EIGHTY USE TO TURN THOSE AROUND QUICKER SO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IT FROM MULTIPLE FRONTS WAS ON THE FEES. THE PROCESS AND BUT STILL TRY TO HAVE ADDRESSED AFFORDABILITY ELEMENT TO IT SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY HOW WERE WERE ADDRESSING EIGHTY USE AND AND AGAIN WE'VE SEEN IT FAIRLY GOOD RESPONSE. ON THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION IS THAT -- SOMEBODY OUTSIDE AGENCIES YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SCHOOL. BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOR THEIR TEACHERS AND STAFF THAT THEY HAVE ASKED ME TO COME PRESENT TO THE SCHOOL BOARD BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TO SEE IF THEY CAN MODEL SOMETHING OFF OF WHAT WE DID LOCALLY TO APPLY TO THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT FEES SO -- THEY'RE STARTING THERE'S OTHER PLAYERS ARE STARTING TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR EVERYBODY AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. ONE QUESTION I I THINK THAT'S A GREAT STORY. OUR HOUSING COMMITTEE WERE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY HOLDING A FUTURE HEARING ABOUT WHAT REBUILDING AFTER WILDFIRES LOOKS LIKE SO WE MAY BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU ON THAT -- TELL US WHAT YOUR COST RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IF YOU AREN'T RECOUP IN A FEES HOW ARE YOU ABLE. HOW MUCH OF YOUR COSTS ARE YOU ACTUALLY GETTING BACK HOW YOU PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE? RATE SAYS YOU HEARD THAT TO TWO DIFFERENT FEES ONE IS THE PERMITTING FEE AND ONE IS THE IMPACT FEES THE FEES WE REDUCE FOR THE IMPACT FEES WHICH WAS THE BIG DOLLAR AMOUNT -- IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU CAN HAVE A HOME AND YOU CAN DO A THREE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT ADDITION TO YOUR HOME. AND PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THAT HOME SO WE TOOK THE APPROACH THAT IF IT'S A SMALLER UNIT -- THAT THAT PRIMARY RESIDENCE PAID THAT IMPACT FEE THEY PAID THE FULL IMPACT VIEW OF THAT ORIGINAL HOUSE SO THAT IMPACT IS BEING ADDRESSED -- BY ADDING A FEW MORE PEOPLE TO SAY TO PEOPLE WITHIN A SQUARE FOOT -- UNIT THAT IMPACT IS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE SKIN THE SCHEME OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S THE APPROACH WE TOOK AGAIN WE WERE FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE ON IT -- WE HAD TO MAKE THAT CALL -- BUT ANY UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED PER STATE LAW -- BUT ANYTHING OVER A HUNDRED SQUARE FEET WE INCREMENTALLY STEPPED UP THE FEE TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE THAT ADDITIONAL IMPACT TO THE SYSTEM AS YOU HEARD EARLIER. SO IT BETWEEN SEVEN OR FIFTY TO A THOUSAND IT'S 25% OF THE ANYTHING. THOUSAND OF TWELVE HUNDRED WE DID 50% FEE. AGAIN THAT WAS TO TRY TO RECOUP SOME OF THOSE COSTS TO THE TO YOUR POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. PUSHING ASIDE THE NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS FOR PARKS AND ROADS AND IT CAN ACTIVITY THAT WE NEED OUR COMMUNITY. ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I HAVE A FEW. I WANNA THANK YOU -- IF YOU ONLY KNEW WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH. AND HOW THEY'VE GOTTEN THIS A COMMUNITY BACK ON THEIR FEET SLOWLY BUT SURELY SO THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK AND TIME AND FRUSTRATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT -- SO COUPLE QUESTIONS I HAVE DO YOU THINK THAT EVERY JURISDICTION CAN DO THIS AS ORDERED AS A DEPEND ON WHETHER WATER SEWER IS DONE IN HOUSE. OR RATHER THAN PROVIDED BY SPECIAL DISTRICT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION WE WE WE DO HAVE WATERS OR IN HOUSE IN THE CITY -- WE THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG AS WE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THIS FEE STRUCTURE -- WITH JUST PARK AND AND OUR CAPITAL FACILITY FEES WHICH IS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. IT TOOK US ABOUT TWO MONTHS MORE TO WORK WITH THE WATER DEPARTMENT TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WOULD WORK FOR THEM AS YOU HEARD THERE'S PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WE HAD TO BE AWARE OF OUR BE BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- BUT WE FINALLY GOT THERE FOUND A SOLUTION THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD WORK SO WE DID -- LOOK AT THE SMALLER UNITS ANYTHING OVER SEVEN FIFTY SQUARE FEET THOSE WATERS OR IF YOU START TO KICK AND THE OTHER THING WE WORKED WITH HIM ON IS THAT THE SMALLER UNITS WE DON'T% REQUIRE SEPARATE CONNECTION. A SEPARATE METER AGAIN THAT WAS AN ADDED COST TO HOMEOWNERS WHICH IS FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL ALMOST DOUBLES THE FEE SO WHEN YOU GET INTO THE ROADWAY AND START PUTTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN METERS. THAT IT ISN'T A BIG COST BUT THERE IS A DISCUSSION TO HAVE BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG PUSH FOR WATER CONSERVATION AND SEPARATE MEETING IN THERE'S A VALUE TO THAT. BUT OUR PRIORITY FOR OUR CITY WAS BRINGING HOUSING STOCK TO OUR COMMUNITY AND QUICKLY. WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB TRYING TO DO THAT AND WHAT PROCESS WOULD YOU RECOMMEND TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS THEY'RE LOOKING -- TO EXPEDIA AT THE EIGHTY YOU. CONSTRUCTION WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD CHALLENGES AND HE WAS SOME IDEAS. I THINK THE ONE IS TO TO REACH OUT TO COMMUNITY FIRST BECAUSE IT DOES TAKE COMMUNITY INPUT -- SETBACKS AND PARKING OR ARE VERY REAL THINGS TO INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR HOMES. PEOPLE PUSH BACK ON IF AS A REDUCE PARKING MORE PARKING ON THE STREET THAT THAT BECOMES A A TOPIC -- BUT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S AN A PEOPLE EMBRACE THE CONCEPT OF PROVIDING THIS -- FOR RIGHT REASONS I THINK WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS -- OF DO LOOK AT THE FEE STRUCTURE -- IT YET YEAH I THINK I THINK BE BOLD TRY THINGS IF IT DOESN'T WORK FIX IT AND I THINK THAT'S OUR AND HAS BEEN OUR MODEL THROUGH THE ENTIRE REBUILD WE DON'T THERE'S NO PLAYBOOK FOR THIS WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE HIS OUT AS WE GO WE WERE TRYING. THINGS IF IT DOESN'T WORK WE TWEAK IT AND THEY'RE BACK TO COUNCIL WE TWEAK IT AND WE KEEP CHANGING IT. UNTIL WE GET IT RIGHT BUT IF WE JUST STOP AND WAIT UNTIL WE GET SOMETHING PERFECT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING WILL MOVE FORWARD SO. MY MY ADVICE TO JUMP IN AND AND TRY SOMETHING AMEN [inaudible] THE YEAH IT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY SIGNAL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER GOOD MORNING MORNING -- WE HAVE SOPHIA'S SKODA FROM THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FROM EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT ALSO EFFECTUALLY NOTICE. IS FAMOUS. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TERRACE AND A MEMBERS -- SO AGAIN YES I'M SO FEWEST GO TO THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE AT THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT AND I I AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE EAST BAY MEDS. PERSPECTIVE ON UTILITY AT CONNECTION CAPACITY FEES PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO EIGHTY USE. SO JUST AS BACKGROUND IS BEEN MY PROVIDES DRINKING WATER TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION CUSTOMERS IN TWENTY CITIES IN TWO COUNTIES ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA IN THE EASTERN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. WE ALSO PROVIDE WASTEWATER TREATMENT SIR FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO A SUBSET OF OUR SERVICE OR THE KIND OF HUGS THE WATER THERE -- WEIRD INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICT SO -- WE'RE A LARGE AGENCY AND UNIQUE IN THAT -- OTHER UTILITIES THAT ARE GENERALLY ARE SIZE ARE USUALLY PART OF A CITY OR COUNTY WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST RETAILER OF WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND TWELFTH LARGEST IN THE NATION. SO OUR WATER DISTRIBUTION -- AND INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IS EXTENSIVE WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF MILES OF DISTRIBUTION PIPE -- HUNDREDS OF PUMPING PLANTS HUNDREDS OF NEIGHBORHOOD RESERVOIRS AND THE WASTE WATER DECIDED HOUSE WHAT WE DON'T ON THE COLLECTION SYSTEM WE OWN THE LARGE INTERCEPTORS THAT THOSE CONNECT TO AND THE TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY DISCHARGED INTO THE BAY -- AND OUR REVENUE STREAM -- AS TIM HAD ALSO MENTIONED IS DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF A A CITY OR A COUNTY THAT WE RELY PRIMARILY ON THE RATES AND FEES THAT WE CHARGE. AND ALL THOSE OF COURSE ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PROP TO EIGHTEEN AND PROP TO EIGHT DOT TWENTY SIX NOW PART OF OUR CONSTITUTION -- AND AND SO FORCE REFLECTING THE COST OF SERVICE SO THOSE ARE THE REFUSE THAT WE USE THIS COUNTRY TO MAINTAIN TO UPGRADE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MEET FUTURE SUPPLY DEMANDS. SO -- THE CONNECTION CAPACITY CHARGES AREN'T -- AND AGAIN DAVID THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO REALLY SIT DOWN WITH WITH WATER AND SEWER BECAUSE THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT COSTS -- AND YOU MAY ASK WHAT WE MEAN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE -- FOR THE WATER SUPPLY TO SERVE NEW DEVELOPMENT SO ESSENTIALLY OUR MAJOR GOAL IS TO BE THERE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS OUR NUMBERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE THOSE FACILITIES AND ALL THE WATER SUPPLY AND EVERYTHING IS THERE SO THAT WE'RE NOT A HINDRANCE TO GROWTH THAT WERE. REALLY THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET THAT FUTURE DEMAND AND WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT FUTURE DEMAND -- IS ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN WE MAKE OUR OUR PLANS AND CONSIDER ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEM. SO EXAMPLES OF THAT MEANS -- LOOKING AT SUFFICIENT STORAGE CAPACITY WATER SUPPLIES PUMPING CAPACITY -- OVER SIZING IN SOME CASES OF DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND PIPELINES OF WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A GROWTH IN IN CERTAIN AREAS -- COORDINATING WITH THE CITIES THAT ARE IN OUR EFFICIENT -- AT ALL TIMES OF DAY -- AND NIGHT -- BUT SIMPLY MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TO MEET OUR PRESENT IT OBVIOUSLY ISN'T ENOUGH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO THE SYSTEM -- OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT FIRES FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT'S NOT AN INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE FOR US -- AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH DEVASTATING FIRE IN OUR SERVICE AREA THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE EVEN TODAY IS. CONSIDERED THE THIRD WORST FIRE IN STATE HISTORY IN TERMS OF LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO ANY NEW DEMAND ON OUR SYSTEM -- IS IS SUCH THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT ALL OF THE THE SUPPLY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SERVE THAT AND THAT COSTS MONEY. AND SO -- FOR US CONNECTION FEES AND CAPACITY CHARGES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY A PART OF A READ AFFORDABILITY SO THAT'S KIND OF THE NEXUS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- THEY REALLY HELP TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE DEVELOPMENT ARE ACTUALLY PAYING THE COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH -- SERVING THAT DEVELOPMENT -- WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T RECOVER THE COSTS FROM -- FROM THOSE FEES AND CHARGES WELL ESSENTIALLY RATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT I MEAN AS TIM HAD SAID EARLIER THE IT'S ONE OR THE OTHER. AND IN OUR CASE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RATE BASIS LOW INCOME WE ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT THAT ONE THIRD OF OUR SERVICE AREAS LIVING AT TUNER PERCENT OR BELOW THE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT. SO AN ARC FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO BURDEN OUR REPAIRS PARTICULARLY OUR LOW INCOME REPAIRS GIVEN PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND OTHER -- LONG EFFECT WITH THE COST OF NEW DEVELOPMENT. SO -- AT PRESENT IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW WE DO NOT CHARGE CAPACITY FEES FOR EIGHTY USE UNLESS THE SEPARATE STRUCTURE IS BEING ADDED AND IF THAT SEPARATE STRUCTURE ASKS IF THEY WANT TO THAT IS ASKS US TO INCREASE CAPACITY TO THEIR PARTICULAR PROPERTY. SO EVER PROPERTY OWNER APPROACHES US WITH A NEW STRUCTURE TERRORISTS IF IT'S YOU KNOW INSIDE THE FOOTPRINT GREAT NO PROBLEM -- BUT IF THEY PURCHASE NAY SAY WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY HAVING A NEW STRUCTURE AND WE THINK WE MIGHT NEED SOME ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WILL LOOK AT IT AND WILL EITHER SAY ACTUALLY WE THINK YOU'RE FINE ZERO YOU'RE GOOD DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. OR WELL -- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WANT TO A FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM IN THAT UNIT IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY LAW BUT YOU WANT IT AND SO YOU'VE GOT A REALLY OLD YOU KNOW FIVE EIGHT CENTS LINE. AS DAVID MENTIONED DIGGING INTO THIS THINGS ARE EXPENSIVE AND SO -- WE WILL CHARGE THEM TO PUT IN A NEW LINE AND TO PUT IN A NEW METER AND SO THAT'S THAT'S A SECOND COST AND THEN LET'S SAY WELL YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT ADDING A HOUSE THAT IS ABOUT THE SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE IS THE ORIGINAL HOUSE. THAT'S FINE TOO BUT WE'LL JUST LOOK AT WHAT SIZE LINE DO YOU REALLY NEED AND IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOU KNOW A FIVE EIGHTHS INCH LINE YOU WE CENTURY JUST CHARGE YOU THE INCREMENTS UP TO THE NEXT SIZE -- FOR CAPACITY SO THAT'S HOW IT'S ACTUALLY WORKING IN IN PART AND CURRENT PRACTICE AND ALL THOSE CHARGES ARE FORCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAWS. SO -- HAVE TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW ALL THIS IS WORKING OR SERVICE OR AN ARTICLE FROM FROM THE TURNER CENTER I'M WHICH IS IN A LOT OF GREAT WORK IN THIS AREA NOTED THAT THE CITY OF OAKLAND SINCE THE LAW CHANGED. HAS RECEIVED A TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN EIGHTY YOU APPLICATIONS -- IN THE ELEVENTH MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE CHANGE IN THE LAW. DURING THAT SAME PERIOD WE RECEIVED ONLY EIGHT APPLICATIONS FOR WATER SERVICE TO REVIEW WHETHER AND EIGHTY YOU REQUIRED ADDITIONAL -- WORK SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WORKING JUST FINE AND THAT WAS JUST OAKLAND ALONE OVERALL -- OVER THAT PERIOD TWENTY FOUR WE HAD IN OUR SERVICE AREA. SO IN PRACTICE WERE NOT GENERALLY NOTIFIED WHEN AN EIGHTY USE BEING ADDED TO A PROPERTY IF SOMEONE'S CHANGING THEIR GARAGE AND THEIR THEIR INTO AN EIGHTY YOU AN ADDITIONAL SPACE. WERENOT NOTIFIED -- AND AS LONG AS PROBLEM. SO IN THE CASE TO BE SPENT MEDS SERVICE ARE AT PRESENT I GUESS IN IN KIND OF STARTING TO CLOSE -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION TO SUGGEST THAT ARE UTILITY CONNECTION FEES AND CAPACITY CHARGES ARE IN ANY WAY HOLDING BACK DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY USE IT'S HAPPENING. OF INSIDE OF THE FOOTPRINT OF THE OF THE BUILDING -- YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S BEEN NO PROBLEM AND AND FOR THE ONES THAT ARE BUILDING NEW STRUCTURES WERE WORKING WITH FOLKS. SO -- CHARGES FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT WHICH INCREASED DEMAND ON OUR SYSTEM THOUGH SO THOSE WHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY ADDING LET'S SAY THE SAME SQUARE FOOTAGE OF AN ADDITIONAL -- HOME ON A LOT -- YOU DOES INCREASED DEMANDS ON OUR SYSTEM AND BEING ABLE -- TO CHARGE YOU FOR THAT INCREASED CAPACITY -- IS -- IS IMPORTANT -- AS EIGHTY USE POTENTIALLY YOUR BEING OFFERED AS AS PART OF A SOLUTION FOR OUR OUR CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BE COULD REALLY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN IN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND IN ACCOUNTING FOR IN PLANNING FOR THOSE DEMANDS ON OUR SYSTEM -- SO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF A RECENT I'M 25% OF HOMEOWNER SAID THAT THEY WOULD WOULD CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ADDING AN EIGHTY YOU -- SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS I THINK I THINK IT WAS FROM A TURNER REPORT THAT MENTION THE BAY AREA PULL BUT OVER ABOUT TWENTY YEARS SO FOR OUR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL POPULATION. THAT WOULD REPRESENT AROUND NINETY THOUSAND EIGHTY USE OVER TWENTY YEARS DIVIDED BY THE THAT'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS A YEAR. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ADDED TO OUR SYSTEM -- WE ADDED FIVE HUNDRED SINGLE FAMILY HOME EQUIVALENTS -- LAST YEAR FOR SFR IS NOT FOR MULTI FAMILY SO -- IS SO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED VIEW IS ABOUT TEN TIMES WHAT WE'RE ADDING NOW AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. AND POTENTIALLY REPRESENTS AS AS WE SAID AN ENTIRELY NEW HOUSING PARADIGM WITH POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT WATER WASTEWATER SERVICE DEMANDS THAT WE WOULD NEED TO PREPARE -- FOR SO WHEN'S NEW STRUCTURES ARE BEING BUILT THAT RESULT IN INCREASED DEMAND ON THE SYSTEM -- UTILITIES NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMPOSE CONNECTION CAPACITY FEES AND IF NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE COSTS WILL SIMPLY SHIFT FROM -- YOU KNOW -- THE DEVELOPMENT TO THE REPAIRS -- AND THIS OF COURSE DRIVE SEPARATES AND IN OUR CASE PERSONALLY BURDENS THE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PARTICULAR SERVICE AREA. SO THAT'S ARE PERSPECTIVE WE HOPE IT'S HELPFUL -- AND WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ITS HAS BEEN HEARING QUESTIONS. SHORTER THAN SAY I HAVE ONE QUICK JUST COMMENT -- I REPRESENT RURAL AREAS AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT SOME OF OUR RURAL AREAS I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN YEAH. EIGHTY USE. BUT IF THERE'S HOOK UPS AND STUFF SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR OLDER COMMUNITIES ARE WILL BE REALLY IMPACTED IN SO I HATE TO SEE THEIR FEES GO UP BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND -- IT KIND OF OPENS UP A CAN OF WORMS IN SOME COMMUNITIES BECAUSE YOU GO TO FIX SOMETHING AND IT JUST GOES FROM. WORSE TO WORSE SO DURING OUR TESTIMONY IN GOING FOR THEIR I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO OUR HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THIS KIND OF LEGISLATION OR WHATEVER IT WORKS FOR ALL COMMUNITIES OR DO WE NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR A REAL COMMUNITY SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY. I HAD ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR MR GARCIA FROM THE TURNER CENTER SO -- I AM LOOKING AT A REPORT FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FROM YOUR CENTER ABOUT THE SEATTLE VANCOUVER -- AND PORTLET EXPERIENCES COULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT POLICIES A MOVE FORWARD -- THAT ARE DIFFERENT OR BETTER THAN WHAT WE CAN DO WE'VE GOT LESSONS TO LEARN. SURE -- IN JUST TO CLARIFY ABOVE SPECIFICALLY FEES SO EL ALL THEIR POLICIES WELL IT SEEMS AS I JUST CAN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE REPORT IT SEEMS LIKE -- THOSE THREE CITIES THAT HAVE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME HOUSING ISSUES THAT WE DO HAVE BAD MARKEDLY MORE SUCCESSFUL AT EIGHTY PRODUCTION THEM CALIFORNIA HAS IN RECENT YEARS. WONDERING WHAT THEY'RE DOING DIFFERENTLY -- SO -- I WOULD SAY THAT -- THOSE THREE SPECIFIC CITIES HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS -- THAT HAVE PRE DATE THE STATEWIDE PERFORMS AT THE WE HAD JUST A FEW YEARS AGO -- I ALREADY MENTIONED WITH PORTLAND DID WITH REGARDS TO FEES I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT -- STEP FORWARD IN THE DEVELOPMENT EIGHTY USE IN PORTLAND -- BEFORE THAT CHANGE WAS MADE -- FEES WERE OFTEN TIMES CITED JUST AS MUCH AS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND FINANCING IS A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPING A TO USE IN THAT CITY -- IN PLACES LIKE SEATTLE IN BEING WHAT IS ACTUAL -- OUT ON ALIVE SO SET BACKS IF THE OURS ARE THINGS THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED HERE AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL -- ANOTHER INTERESTING COMPONENT TO SOME OF THE CITIES HAVE ADDRESSED IS ALSO THE ISSUE VOTER OCCUPANCY. AND THAT IN. PORTLAND AND NO LONGER HAS -- WATER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS AND THEY HAVE SEEN SOME INCREASES RESULT THEIR SOLUTIONS SOME OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN -- DONE IN THESE OTHER CITIES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD SERVE AS MODELS FOR WHAT WE MAY WANT TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT THE WHETHER IT'S THE CITY LEVEL OR PERHAPS AT THE STATE THANK YOU. I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR YOUR INSIGHTS AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS I SUSPECT THIS WILL BE A A REAL TOPIC THIS YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE. WHEN WE GO NOW TO OUR FINAL PANEL LIKE TO INVITE UP -- MISTER NECKLACE BACK UP TO THE PODIUM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT -- MISTER ERIC PHILLIPS FROM THE LAW FIRM OF GOLDFARB. ELEVEN AND ALSO HIS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. AND THERE ARE TWO VARMA WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THE PANEL WILL BE DISCUSSING CHALLENGES AND PAUL SINGULAR IT CONSIDERATIONS FOR EIGHTY DEVELOPMENT IN OUR STATE. MR NICHOLS I KNOW YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK EARLIER BUT LET US KNOW ANY OTHER TOPICS YOU WANT TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE WOULD JUST -- JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT AGAIN SOME OF THE IS UP WHEN WE GET CONTACTED BY. TELEPHONE OR EMAIL ABOUT ISSUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE. WELL TRYING TO OBTAIN A PERMIT FOR AN EIGHTY YOU -- IF WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT HERE SUBSTANTIAL FEES FOR SEWER WATER UTILITIES IN THE IMPACT FEES SUCH AS AMONGST MANY OTHERS BUT TRANSPORTATION PARKS. OF FEES ARE NOT OFTEN REVISED TO BE PROPORTIONAL. TO THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECT IS REQUIRED BY LAW AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. WHILE A CD WILL DO A HIGH LEVEL REVIEW OF FEES AS PART OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT. WE DO NOT REVIEW NEXUS STUDIES ONE FOURTH PROVISIONS FOR THE MEDICATION FEE ACT. IN SOME CASES FEES ARE NOT AT A LOCAL AGENCY CONTROL SUCH AS SPECIAL DISTRICTS WATER CORPORATIONS -- PARK FEES AND SCHOOLS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS LOCAL AGENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CREATION OF A NEW GARAGE WHEN THE GARAGE FOR EXISTING SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING IS CONVERTED TO AN EIGHTY YOU EIGHTY LAWS -- IT ALLOWS THAT PARKING THAT DISPLAYS PARKING IT WAS IN THE GARAGE OF THE PRIMARY DWELLING TO BE CONFIGURED. ELSEWHERE ON THE LOT -- IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING COST CREATED EIGHTY YOU THE REQUIREMENT TO REPLACE A GARAGE STRUCTURE MAY ALSO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL EIGHTY LOT INVENTORY. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF LOTS. THAT COULD TWO LOT SIZE FLOOD COVERAGE. OR BUILDING SET BACKS. EMAIL LOCATIONS THIS CONDITION RESULTS IN A PROVISION FOR EIGHTY USE PROPOSED TO BE CREATED WITHIN THE SPACE OF AN EXISTING GARAGE. AND THEN WE HAVE ON OUR OCCUPANCY CABINS WERE DEED RESTRICTION REQUIREMENTS BY LOCAL AGENCIES MAY CONSTRAIN MANY OWNERS. FROM CREATING AN EIGHTY YOU. TO THE CONCERN THAT WHEN THE PROPERTY SOLD. IT MUST BE PURCHASED BY WITH A COMMITMENT BY THE BUYER. TO RESIDE AT THE PROPERTY OR AS MANY COVENANTS REQUIRE. THE MAY CREATE A COMMITMENT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO REMOVE THE VIDEO -- MINIMUM LOT SIZE CONSTRAINTS -- COME UP FAIRLY OFTEN WE HAVE SOME THAT HAVE BEEN -- WELL OVER TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET -- THE SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT THE NUMBER OF LOTS AVAILABLE FOR EIGHTY YOU -- AND MAY WITH SMALLER LAW TO ALLOW ANY DO YOU PICK TO BE CREATED. AND LASTLY WE HEAR ABOUT FIRE SPRINKLERS REQUIRED FOR NEEDY YOU BY LOCAL AGENCY BUILDING DEPARTMENT OR FIRE DEPARTMENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE EXEMPT. WHEN THE PRIMARY DWELLING? IS NOT REQUIRE THERE'S PICTURES THAT'S SORT OF LIKE THAT BUT ABOUT THE TOP FIVE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE WE ARE -- ASKED ABOUT A COME [inaudible] THE SPLASHES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS. LET'S MOVE TO MISTER PHILLIPS -- VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS ERIC PHILLIPS I'M A LAWYER WITH GOLDFARB AND LET MEN WHERE A A FIRM BASED IN OAKLAND -- WE REPRESENT BOTH PRIVATE HOUSING DEVELOPERS PRIMARILY -- NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES -- I PERSONALLY HAVE WORKED WITH MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES WRITING THERE AT YOU ORDINANCES SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT NONE OF THE ISSUES THAT MR NECKLACE -- JUST BROUGHT UP OR IN ANY OF THE ORDINANCES I'VE WORKED ON SO -- I HATE A TO THAT THOSE ARE DEFINITELY AT RULES THAT ARE CLEAR IN THE LAW AND AND PEOPLE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING THE MIKE I AGREE -- BUT TODAY I'M HERE -- IN MY ROLE WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR POLICY AND LEGISLATION AND I'M HERE TO SHARE -- THAT ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVE USE AND THE PLANNING PRINCIPLES THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT EIGHTY USE AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. AS AN ORGANIZATION -- EPA HAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- FOR PROFESSIONAL PLANNERS -- FROM BOTH PUBLIC AGENCIES AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND AS AN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY YEARS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE. THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF HOUSING -- TO ADDRESS THAT THE CRISIS THAT WE FACE -- AND WE ALSO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND INCENTIVES THAT WILL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY USE THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS. EARLIER THAT BROUGHT SOME EXAMPLES TO MIND THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE BEFORE EIGHT I TOUCH ON SOME OF MADE. THE BULK OF MY COMMENTS -- BUT THERE WERE THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT -- BOTH INCENTIVES FOR EIGHTY PRODUCTION AND MAKING SURE THAT THEIR OF EIGHTY USE ARE AFFORDABLE AND I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. TO HEAR THOSE TWO TOGETHER -- AS RECENTLY A LOAN PRO WHERE -- IS CAN BORROW -- LOW INTEREST LOANS FROM THE COUNTY -- IN EXCHANGE FOR HAVING DEED RESTRICTIONS ON EIGHTY USE THAT THEY CREATE ON THEIR PROPERTY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE. ACTUALLY BEING USED TO INCREASE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK NOT JUST HOUSING STOCK IN GENERAL -- AT A NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY THE HOUSING TRUST OF SILICON VALLEY IS ALSO -- LAUNCHING A SIMILAR PROGRAM SO -- THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THE STATE CURRENTLY DOESN'T REQUIRE AFFORDABILITY AND LARGE EIGHTY IS UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET CERTAINLY WON'T BE AFFORDABLE BY DEFINITION -- BUT HAVING OTHER INCENTIVES TO CREATE THE PRODUCTION OF EIGHTIES AND TYING THAT TO AFFORDABILITY CERTAINLY MAKES SENSE -- ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND WANTED TO SHARE -- COMES RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA LEFT BUT IT'S FROM THE NORTHERN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND THE CITY OF ENCINITAS HAS RECENTLY -- ADOPTED PRE APPROVED EIGHTY YOU PLANS AND THE CITY TO FUNDED CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS -- FOR I THINK TWELVE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF EIGHTY USE RIGHT RANGING FROM STUDIO ALL THE WAY UP TO THREE BEDROOM -- LIVING UNITS THAT THE CITY PAID FOR THE DESIGN HOMEOWNERS CAN COME AND GET THOSE CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS FOR FREE THE CITY HAS PRE PERMITTED THEM. SO THE DESIGN COSTS AND PERMITTING COSTS ARE GREATLY REDUCED FOR HOMEOWNERS -- AND THAT'S A WAY TO REDUCE THE BARRIER FOR CREATING EIGHTY YEARS WHILE HAVING DESIGNS THAT. THE NEIGHBORS HAVE ALL OVER THE CITY HAS ALREADY REFLECT LOCAL CONDITIONS AND CONCERNS -- AND THAT LEADS A SPEEDIER AND LESS COSTLY PRODUCTION OF OF EIGHTIES ON THE PART OF THE HOMEOWNERS -- SO THOSE ARE SOME IDEAS OF THINGS THAT ARE WORKING WELL UNDER THAT THE CURRENT LAWS THAT WE HAVE. AND AS WE THINK OF WAYS TO YOU -- CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE EIGHTY DEVELOPMENT GOING FORWARD I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW AREAS -- WHERE WE SHOULD ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT -- LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS -- AS WERE MENTIONED IN AN OPENING REMARKS AND THAT CONTEXT MATTERS FOR WHERE WE'RE PUTTING EIGHTY USE -- PART OF GOOD PLANNING A CERTAINLY THINKING OF CONTEXT SENSITIVE REGULATIONS I DON'T SPEAK JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. WHY SOME ONE SIZE FITS ALL STANDARDS DON'T REALLY WORK -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE FOR EIGHTY YEARS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE CONSIDERING THE VARIATIONS IN HOUSING DEMANDED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN INFILL AREAS THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION -- YOUR EARLIER PANEL SPOKE QUITE A BIT ABOUT FEES AND INFRASTRUCTURE SO I WON'T SPEND MUCH TIME ON IT BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. PROPER PLANNING REQUIRES RELATING GROSS TO THE CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN ABSORB THE GROWTH THAT'S PLANNED FOR THEM. AND PLANNING ALSO REQUIRES HAVE STABILITY AND CONSISTENCY SO THAT WE CAN RESPOND TO AN IMPLEMENT CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED ALREADY -- SO. FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON THE CONTEXT SENSITIVITY AND AND THOSE RELATED ISSUES -- I AS AN ORGANIZATION AT CALIFORNIA EPA WITH SUPPORTS. ALLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL EIGHTY YOU IN AN ALMOST ANY EXISTING STRUCTURE FOR THE REASONS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE PANELISTS EARLIER TODAY -- AS LONG AS THOSE ARE ARE PAIRED WITH. LOT COVERAGE STANDARDS THAT WOULD PERMIT. PERMIT NEW DETACHED EIGHTY YEARS AND THOSE ARE BOTH. A REASONABLE WAYS TO ALLOW NEW EIGHTY YEARS WHILE STILL I AM HAVING SOME. CHECK ON ON THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH -- BUT THE CONTEXT I THINK DESERVES TO BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY -- AS I MENTIONED BETWEEN URBAN INFILL AREAS AND RURAL AREAS I'M. THINKING SPECIFICALLY OF RURAL AREAS -- I'M WARY OF ENCOURAGING TOO MUCH GROWTH IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S NOT TRANSIT ACCESS -- OR EVEN NEARBY SERVICES I THINK THAT THAT -- HAVING MULTIPLE EIGHTY USE ON MORE RURAL LOTS -- RUNS THE RISK OF INCREASING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND POTENTIALLY EVEN RUNNING COUNTER TO SEE SOME OF THE I. GHG REDUCTION GOALS AND CLIMATE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE -- DIFFERENT CONTEXT AGAIN FOR URBAN INFILL SITE -- SO AS WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO INTENSIFY EIGHTY YEARS HAVING THOSE BE OPTING PROGRAMS ARE HAVING DIFFERENT ROLES BETWEEN -- RURAL AND URBAN AREAS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- I'M ALSO SENSITIVE TO RURAL AREAS WHERE AGRICULTURE REMAINS PREVALENT AND THE MORE RESIDENTIAL USES THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO AGRICULTURAL AREAS -- THE MORE AT RISK THOSE ACT AGRICULTURAL PRESERVATION EFFORTS BECOMES AND I'M I WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND ASK THAT THAT BE PART OF THE CONCERT EIGHTY YEARS ARE ENCOURAGED AND PERMITTED -- AND THEN I ALSO AM. IN LATE SPECTACULARLY ITS TOP OF MIND I'M FOLLOWING THE PAST TWO YEARS OF FIRES. WHERE WE PERMIT GROWTH HAS A DRASTIC CONSEQUENCES FOR THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF THOSE TYPES OF DISASTERS -- AND MAKING SURE THAT AT LEAST THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR SENSIBLE LOCAL CONTROLS THAT WILL REDUCE FIRE HAZARDS AS RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT INTENSIFIES IS AN IMPORTANT POINT -- MINIMUM STANDARDS -- IN URBAN AREAS AROUND FAR IN LOT COVERAGE. ALLOWING SOME LOCAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE TYPES OF STANDARDS IS IMPORTANT IT HELPS INSURE GREEN SPACE AN OTHERWISE BUILT OUT ENVIRONMENTS. AND IT CAN HELP REDUCE NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION TO NEW. RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND INTENSIFICATION AND WITHIN THOSE AREAS -- AND IN MORE RURAL AREAS -- Là COVERAGE F. A. R. ESPECIALLY SETBACKS BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT TO PROVIDING DEFENSIBLE SPACES TO MINIMIZE FIRE RISK -- SO MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A LOCAL ABILITY TO HAVE -- APPROPRIATE IN CONTEXT SENSITIVE RULES AROUND THAT IS IS AGAIN JUST VERY IMPORTANT -- I DID WANT TO PICK UP ON A COMMENT THAT -- DAVID GOING FROM SANTA ROSA HAD SHARED EARLIER THAT IN SMALL EIGHTY USE -- LIKELY DON'T HAVE THEM ANYMORE IMPACT ON THE RESIDENTIAL -- HOME -- WOULD INDEPENDENTLY AND AND THAT -- BUT AS EIGHTY USE THAT ARE PERMITTED ALL THE WAY UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET -- COME INTO PLAY WHEN I LIVE IN A THREE BEDROOM TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT AND HOUSE AND BERKELEY. AND THAT THAT'S NO DIFFERENT -- IN TERMS OF IMPACT THAN -- A LARGE EIGHTY YEARS SO I'M THINKING ABOUT THE SIZE AND AS WORLD ALLOWING LARGER EIGHTY USE MAKING SURE THAT COMMUNITIES AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO ABSORB THAT GROWTH AS WE INCREASED POPULATION DENSITY THREE LARGER EIGHTY YEARS. AND THERE WILL BE AN INCREASED DEMAND ON SERVICE SAYS -- SEWER AND WATER CAPACITY ROSE TRANSIT SCHOOLS I AM IT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND -- ESPECIALLY IF MORE THAN ONE EIGHTY YOU WAS GOING TO BE PERMITTED HER A LOT -- I THINK IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. ALLOW JURISDICTIONS TO PERMIT THAT I AM ESPECIALLY IF THEY CAN DO YOU THE ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES CAN ABSORB. THAT INTENSIVE INTENSIFIED GROWTH BUT MAKING THAT SORT OF REAL MANDATORY -- I THINK RUNS THE RISK OF STRAINING AND THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL. UTILITY DISTRICT ABOUT AND THAT AGENCIES POTENTIAL CHALLENGES -- SCALING UP TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW I THINK THAT THAT COULD BE EVEN MORE INTENSIFIED LOOKING AT WATER AND SEWER SERVICE ISSUES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THINKING OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS THAT ARE ON WELLS AND SEPTIC SERVICE. ALLOWING. LARGE OR MULTIPLE EIGHTY YEARS ON THOSE TYPES OF PROPERTIES -- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT MAKES SENSE IN RELATION TO THEIR CAPACITY TO ABSORB AT AND THE ABILITY AGAIN TO HAVE -- SOME LOCAL -- REGULATIONS TO MONITOR THAT IS REMAINS IMPORTANT -- AND I ALSO AT NOT TO KEEP PICKING ON DAVID BUT HIS COMMENTS FROM ABOUT HOW SANTA ROSA HAS HANDLED THEIR FEES. IS A VERY. CREATIVE AND SENSIBLE WAY TO SCALE. THE SIZE AND IMPACT OF ACTUAL EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT -- CONTRASTING THAT WITH A PROPOSAL TO YOU ELIMINATE ALL FEES ALTOGETHER ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST EIGHTY USE THAT ARE PERMITTED -- AND THEN AS THEY CAN BEGIN TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS -- AGAIN IT AS A PLANNING AGENCY -- ARE AT PLANNING ORGANIZATION I'M. WITH DO YOU LOOK TO HAVE SOME PREDICTABILITY AND STABILITY STABILITY AROUND -- THE RULES THAT ARE -- GOVERNING DEVELOPMENT SO THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THEM AS PROFESSIONALS -- I KNOW SAN MATEO COUNTY WAS BROUGHT UP AS A JURISDICTION THAT'S DOING A GOOD JOB WITH EIGHTY PRODUCTION. THAT JURISDICTION WORKED WITH THAT THAT TWENTY INCORPORATED CITIES WITHIN SAN MATEO COUNTY -- TO DO A COLLABORATIVE PLANNING EFFORT TO UPDATE THEIR EIGHTY YOU ORDINANCES TOGETHER -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TO YOU -- COME UP WITH SHARED STANDARD -- CONTACTS IN THAT REGION -- AND THE IT WAS A LARGE PLANNING EFFORT TO ROLL OUT AND AND GET THE RULES IN PLACE AND EFFECTIVE SO THAT THEY WERE COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW AND ABLE TO ENCOURAGE. EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT AND I JUST AND WARY OF TOO MANY CHANGES TOO FAST THAT WOULD UNDO THAT GOOD WORK OR CONTINUE TO BURDEN -- PLANNING STAFFS AND AS THEY RUN BACK TO ME TO UPDATE THEIR ORDINANCE EVERY YEAR -- I LIKE IT BUT AS A THE AS A POLICY MATTER THAT MAYBE IS NOT THE BEST USE OF THE RESOURCES THEY COULD BE FOCUSED ON INCENTIVES AND PUTTING THAT TOWARDS ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY YEARS -- SO AS ALL OF THE PANELISTS HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE WE'RE SEEING RESULTS FROM THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED ALREADY. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO LET THAT PROCESS CONTINUE AND BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE MORE HOUSING AND WELL PLANNED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY -- BY CREATING OPTIONAL PER AB PROVISIONS OFFERING INCENTIVES. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHERE NECESSARY TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER PHILLIPS THIS MOMENT. I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT THANK YOU SAYING THEY WERE RURAL A COUPLE. TO THANK YOU WHEN WE MOVED TO MISS MARTHA. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS ARE THE OF OUR MIND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF AYE CITY WIDE POLICY PLANNING AT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES PLANNING DEPARTMENT -- HERE TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF A DEPARTMENTAL PERSPECTIVE -- MIGHT AD BUREAU OVERSEAS THE GENERAL PLAN INCLUDES THE HOUSING ELEMENT OF OUR CITY -- IT ALSO INCLUDES TARGETED TO REGULATE HOUSING AND PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE CITY SAID THANK YOU. FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY I'M GONNA SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE CITY OF LA WITH OUR WITH ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS SO. AS THE LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE CITY ADOPTED ITS FIRST. SECOND DWELLING UNIT AT THE TIME ORDINANCE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE ORDINANCE REQUIRED A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT -- IT RESTRICTED EIGHTY USED TO APPROXIMATELY 20% OF THE PARCELS IN THE CITY. AND HAD PARKING REQUIREMENTS LIMITATIONS ON SQUARE FOOTAGE -- LIMITED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED SQUARE FEET -- AND IT HAD A PASSAGEWAY REQUIREMENTS. IT UP TEN FEET FREE AND CLEAR UP TO THE SKY BETWEEN ALL STRUCTURES WHICH EFFECTIVELY LIMITED THE PRODUCTION OF EIGHTY USED TO ABOUT TEN TO TWENTY A YEAR. THE CITY'S MOST RECENT HOUSING ELEMENT -- YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE WAKE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IDENTIFIED EIGHTY USE AS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF HOUSING FOR THE CITY. IN FACT ONE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS OUT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT SPECIFICALLY CALLED FOR THE CITY TO DO AMONGST OTHER THINGS. IDENTIFY OBSTACLES TO ENABLING SECOND UNITS ON SINGLE FAMILY LOTS AND TO PROPOSE WAYS TO ADDRESS THE OBSTACLES THROUGH ADOPTION OF ZONING CODE AMENDMENTS TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CHALLENGES. A SO WE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- YOU KNOW THROUGH OUR GENERAL PLAN POLICIES -- TO FACILITATE THE PRODUCTION OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS GIVEN SORT OF THE POTENTIAL LARGE OPPORTUNITY IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAVE 70% OF OUR CITY IS. A SINGLE FAMILY WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED DETACHED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE CITY SO THEY'RE REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO EXPLORE THE PRODUCTION OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AS A SOLUTION IN OUR HOUSING ELEMENT. THE MOST DRAMATIC CHANGE THAT WE SAW IN HOUSING PRODUCTION AND EIGHTY USE CAME WITH THE STATE LAW CHANGES IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE AND SB TEN SIXTY NINE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AS LOCAL ORDINANCE HAS BEEN DECLARED NULL AND VOID AND WE'VE BEEN OPERATING UNDER. A STATE LAW WE DO HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY CITY COUNCIL BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED -- SO I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- SOME OF OUR NUMBERS UNDER STATE LAW THAT WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EIGHTY USE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE WE HAD FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE BUILDING PERMITS RECEIVED FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THAT WAS JUST -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN JANUARY FIRST ONE STATE LAW CHANGES WHEN INTO A FACT WE HAVE A TOTAL OF NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN BUILDING PERMITS RECEIVED FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. THIS REPRESENTS AN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FOLD INCREASE FROM THAT SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR WHEN WE ARE OPERATING UNDER THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE ORDINANCE WHERE AGAIN WE WERE WE WERE GETTING YOU KNOW -- TEN TO TWENTY APPLICATIONS A YEAR -- WE'RE SEEING A IS AN THE THE PAST TWO YEARS WE'RE SEEING AN UPWARD TREND CONTINUING SO -- RIGHT WHEN WE FIRST STARTED AND SHE A COUPLE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS COMING IN EVERY MONTH NOW WE'RE AT APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED APPLICATIONS COMING IN A MONTH FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS -- IN TERMS OF DISTRIBUTION WE WENT THROUGH AND MAPPING EXERCISE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE THESE IDEAS WERE COMING UP THROUGHOUT THE CITY -- AND GENERALLY THE THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS SEEM TO BE WELL DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE CITY -- THEIR GREATEST CONCENTRATIONS ARE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY IN AREAS SUCH AS SUN VALLEY NORTH HOLLYWOOD VAN NUYS THOSE ARE PARTS OF OUR CITY WHERE WE TEND TO HAVE LARGER LOT SIZES -- BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY EIGHTY USE -- ACROSS THE CITY AND AND WEST LA AND IN SOUTH LA THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT REPRESENTS -- YOU KNOW DIVERSE DEMOGRAPHICS BEING A REP YOU KNOW RANGING FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO WEALTHIER COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE SEEING IT -- A EXCESS REELING IS REALLY DISPERSED ACROSS THE CITY -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ABOUT 45% OF ALL THE EIGHTY YOU PERMITS THAT OF THAT NINE THOUSAND THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER -- OUR CONVERSIONS OF EXISTING SPACE -- YOU KNOW DUE TO THE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS UNDER STATE LAW WITH RESPECT TO CONVERSIONS -- WHEN THAT WHEN WE WHEN THE STATE LAW FIRST CAME VERSION SO I THINK THIS IS BEEN AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF -- THE REGULATIONS OF THAT STATE LAW THAT'S REALLY ALLOWED FOR THE CREATION OF A TO USE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- THE REMAINDER OF THE EIGHTY USE CONSIST OF ABOUT 35% ADDITIONS AND 20% NEW CONSTRUCTION -- OTHER ASPECTS OF THE STATE LAW THAT HAVE LIKELY RESULTED IN THE EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION INCREASES THE REMOVAL OF THE PASSAGEWAY REQUIREMENT THAT WAS A REAL BARRIER FOR US. IN LOS ANGELES ALSO THE REMOVAL REMOVAL I HAVE -- MINIMUM LOT SIZE AND THAT'S WHERE THE INCREASE OF SQUARE FOOTAGE LIMITATIONS -- TO TWELVE HUNDRED AS WELL AS THE PARKING THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IS. YOU KNOW A FEW AREAS OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES REQUIRE PARKING DUE TO ADJACENCY TO TRANSIT. I GET ALL THIS PRODUCTION HAS OCCURRED UNDER STATE LAW -- I MENTIONED THERE IS A LOCAL ORDINANCE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE LA CITY COUNCIL THIS ORDINANCE IS LOOKING AT LIMITING EIGHTY USE IN CERTAIN HIVE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WITH LIMITED ST APT ACCESS -- WE'VE DONE SOME ANALYSIS WE DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT THIS RESTRICTION SHOULD THE LOCAL ORDINANCE BE ADOPTED -- THAT WILL DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE NUMBERS ONLY ABOUT 2% EIGHTY USE OF OF THAT NINE THOUSAND I MENTIONED -- HAVE BEEN IN THIS TYPE BUYER HAZARD SEVERITIES ON MOST OF THE AGAIN MOST I HAVE BEEN CONVERSIONS WHICH WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED -- OUR LOCAL ORDINANCES ALSO EXPLORING -- PERMITTING MOVABLE TINY HOMES AS A TYPE OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT WHICH TODAY IS CURRENTLY NOT PERMITTED IN OUR ZONING CODE -- ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HEARD MANY EIGHTY YOU APPLICANTS ENCOUNTERING IN LOS ANGELES IS COMPLEX WITH LADWP EASEMENTS. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE LARGELY CENTERED AROUND POWER LINES THAT EXTENDS OVER MANY BACKYARDS ALLEYWAYS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. OUR LOCAL UTILITY LA W. P. -- ESTABLISHED LOCAL REGULATIONS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES -- THAT PREVENT ANY HOW IT'LL STRUCTURES WITHIN A UTILITY EASEMENT AND NO CONSTRUCTION WHATSOEVER UNDERNEATH THE DRIP LINE SO THESE LOCAL ROLES ACTUALLY GO BEYOND. THIS WHAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT THE STATE WIDE UTILITY LEVEL THREE GENERAL ORDER NINETY FIVE A WHICH ALLOWS SOME LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE DRIP LINE WITH -- WITH WITH A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND ALSO I HAVE ALLOWS CONSTRUCTION WITHIN A SIX BUT EASEMENT AROUND THE POWER LINE -- WITH WE'VE LEARNED THAT LED DB W. P. HAS BEEN -- HAS THESE MORE RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT DELUDE P. EMPLOYS WHERE AND IF A POWER LINE DROPS IT REMAINS ACTIVE AND REMAINS LIVE -- OTHER UTILITIES SUCH AS AT AS AN EMPLOYEE TECHNOLOGY WHERE WHEN THE POWER LINE DROPS IT IN AND IT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE BECOMES AN ACTIVE -- SO THESE THESE EASEMENT 20% OF OUR EIGHTY YOU APPLICATIONS THAT ARE COMING IN -- WE'RE CONTINUING TO ADVANCE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE D. W. P. -- TO FIND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS ISSUE -- AND SAFETY CONTINUES TO BE A PARAMOUNT -- DISCUSSION ITEM -- AT THESE MEETINGS. I DID ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO MENTION SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING WITH EIGHTY USE IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THROUGH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE -- THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IS INNOVATION TEAM IN PARTICULAR -- SO FIRST OF THE MAYOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING ON AN EIGHTY YOU PILOT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THROUGH THIS PILOT PROGRAM THE CITY HAS PROVIDED A GRANTS TO A HOUSEHOLD IN HIGHLAND PARK NEIGHBORHOOD OF LOS ANGELES ON WHERE THE HOMEOWNER WANTED TO CONSTRUCT AN EIGHTY YOU. THE CITY REALLY USE THIS PILOT AS A WAY TO LEARN WHAT WAS WORKING AND WHAT WAS NOT WORKING THREE OF EIGHTY YOU PERMITTING PROCESS. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES TO CONSTRUCTING EIGHTY USE IT JUST HAS BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE. PARTICULARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT EIGHTY USES A POTENTIAL SOLUTION FOR HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IS ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND SO THROUGH THIS PILOT PROGRAM THE CITY HAS WORKED WITH THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION LOCALLY GENESIS LA TO CREATE A LOAN PRODUCT THAT WOULD ALLOW A HOMEOWNER TO BORROW AGAINST THE FUTURE VALUE OF THEIR HOME. TO CONSTRUCT AN EIGHTY YOU AND A CITY THROUGH SITUATIONS INCLUDING WALLS FARGO TO EXPAND SUCH SIMILAR -- PRODUCTS. ANOTHER EFFORT THAT THE MAYOR'S OFFICE HAS ENGAGED IN IS THE CREATION OF AN EIGHTY YOU GUIDELINES DOCUMENTED A SORT OF A BROCHURE. THE CITY'S PARTNERED WITH UCLA CITY LAB TO CREATE A USER FRIENDLY GUIDE TO HELP ASSIST THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER WHO MAY NOT KNOW HOW O NAVIGATE THROUGH THE BUILDING PERMITTING SYSTEM -- AND PROVIDES BASIC INFORMATION ON AND AND WALKS HOMEOWNERS TO THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH THE CITY WORKING WITH A LENDER AND WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO ACTUALLY GET. THE EIGHTY YOU BILLS. AND THEN FINALLY THE MAYOR'S OFFICE WAS RECENTLY AWARDED A BLOOMBERG INNOVATION CHALLENGE GRANT OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THE GRANT INCENTIVIZE IS HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD EIGHTY USE FOR PUBLIC GOODS SO REALLY -- EXPLORING. A MODEL WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT ENCOURAGING HOMEOWNERS TO OPEN THEIR BACKYARDS TO CONSTRUCT EIGHTY USE -- TO HOUSE RECENTLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER LOW INCOME PEOPLE SO REALLY CONNECTING THE HOUSING AND SECURE COMMUNITY WITH -- FOLKS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BUILDING EIGHTY USE IN THEIR BACKYARDS. IT'S A THREE YEAR GRANT -- PROGRAM AND WORK WILL LIKELY BE YOUR PRIZED. SO THAT GENERALLY SUMMARIZES THE VARIOUS WAYS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES BOTH IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW. WORKING UNDER STATE LAW THROUGH THE ZONING CODE AND ALSO THREE SAM INNOVATION PROGRAMS IN THE MAYOR'S OFFICE IS LOOKING. TO THANKS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A TO USE IN OUR CITY I WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- EIGHTY USE CONTINUE TO BE A REALLY POPULAR APPLICATION AT OUR DEVELOPMENT SERVICES COUNTER -- IN THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT IN APPROXIMATELY A QUARTER OF ALL A OF OUR NEW HOUSING UNITS IN THE CITY OF LA ARE FOR ACCESSORY DRAWING IN ANSELM -- WITHOUT CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. LET'S A TURNOVER COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS. MR BLOOM I WANNA JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK MISTER BLOOM FOR HIS AUTHORSHIP OF AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH REALLY. MOVE THIS CONVERSATION FORT SIGNIFICANTLY BUT MISTER BUSH. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU -- HE QUICKLY REALIZED WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING WHEN THAT THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH IMMEDIATE ENTHUSIASM FOR IT IT'S AT IS OR SOMETHING -- THAT ARE POPULAR MONKS BOTH NIMBIS AND THE EMPLOYEES UP WITH WHICH IS A PRETTY UNUSUAL TO BE ABLE TO GET EVERYBODY ON THE SAME PAGE -- AND IT'S GRATIFYING TO HEAR IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- A A THE LAST TIME I HEARD ABOUT -- TO HOW MANY APPLICATIONS ARE BEEN THE NUMBER WAS HALF THE NUMBER THAT TO YOU JUST REFERENCED -- WE DID HAVE LEGISLATION LIKE ON THE ISSUE OF POWER LINES OF A TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE THAT'S A A BEEN A SOURCE OF GREAT FRUSTRATION THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE -- TO RESOLVE THAT -- AND THEN YOU DID MENTION THAT -- YOUR CONTINUING TO WORK ON IT OR WE WITHIN SIGHT OF A RESOLUTION -- ON THAT I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO HAVE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH LADWP ON BUT I I I THINK WE'RE CLOSER AT IDENTIFYING WHAT POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS CAN BE I THINK WE'RE REALLY. HONING IN ON THE LOCAL REGULATION AND POTENTIALLY CHANGING THAT RIGHT LOCAL REGULATION IN A WAY THAT STILL CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL ORDER. NINETY FIVE MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY BUT IT STILL REQUIRES FURTHER DISCUSSIONS SO -- MAYBE GO GOOD IDEA -- IF I CAN REQUEST FOR YOU TO BE IN TOUCH WITH MY OFFICE OF IS MAYBE THERE'S A WAY OF HELPING TO FACILITATE THAT CONVERSATION SO THAT HAPPENS MORE QUICKLY OBVIOUSLY. THIS IS A ONE OF THE MANY TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO BE UTILIZING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS -- AND SO I WANT TO BE IS SO YOU MANAGER. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR MISS FARMER THAN ONE FOR THE WHOLE PANEL. YOU TOUCHED UPON THE PILOT YOU HAVE A LOS ANGELES AROUND FINANCING AND THIS IS A CONSISTENT CONCERN OF HER AROUND THE STATE OF THE CHALLENGES OF HOMEOWNERS AND GETTING FINANCING FOR THESE SORTS OF PROJECTS. HERE'S WHAT LESSONS HAVE YOU LEARNED SO FAR THE PILOT ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER AT THE STATE LEVEL -- TO PUSH PRIDE AND SENT OTHERWISE THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL HERE. I YEAH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE WE HAD SUCCESS WITH THE GENESIS LA PROGRAM AND WE'VE BEEN APPROACHING OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND WE ARE WE ARE GAINING SOME TRACTION SO I I I THINK THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES. TO PERHAPS TAKE THAT -- TO A BROADER LEVEL WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS YOU KNOW MAYBE MORE BROADLY AT THE STATE WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THE DETAILS OF THAT PROGRAM AND THAT. PROGRAM WITH YOU -- I I THINK THAT -- WE'VE ALSO BEEN -- AS PART OF THIS -- IT INNOVATION GRANT LOOKING WAYS -- TO IN A SURVEY DIFFERENT -- HOMEOWNERS WERE INTERESTED IN BUILDING EIGHTY USE -- TO YOU KNOW FOR FOR SOME FOR SOME PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES. AND BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES -- WHERE ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE TO CONNECT THEM WITH THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AS I THINK I ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK AT TOO BUT I THINK IT'S KIND OF TWOFOLD LOOKING AT? EXPANDING THE LOAN PRODUCTS AND GRANTS AVAILABLE -- AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT WHERE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY ALREADY GREAT AND I WOULD JUST SAY FOR ANY MEMBERS THE AUDIENCE REPRESENTING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I THINK THERE'S JUST A BROAD INTEREST AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN THE FACT THAT. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AS FAR AS WE WANT SO FAR SUGGEST IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE. A BROADER QUESTION TO THE PANELISTS IF YOU COULD -- WAVE THE MAGIC WAND AND THERE ARE STATE LAWS THAT WERE PASSED TOMORROW TO MOVE FORWARD AND CONTINUE TO TURBO CHARGED. PRODUCTION OF OF ALL THE COULD SEE THIS IS WHAT WOULD YOU DO AND I'M CURIOUS OR THE NEW LAWS THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. O OTHER ISSUES OF OF CHALLENGES OF OF CITIES ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW WONDER HOW YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING. WELL YES WELL WHAT WE ALL AND WE WON'T HOLD YOU DENNIS ARE ASKING YOU JUST BE CREATIVE IN HELPING US THINK THIS THROUGH WELL AS I CAN ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- MISTER NICHOLS HIGHLIGHTED IN HIS PRESENTATION IS THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF CURRENT LAW THAT. MAY NOT EVERY JURISDICTION IS FULLY COMPLYING WITH SO. AND TO ME THAT STEPS OUT AS MORE OF AN ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT ISSUE THEN I NEED FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND WE HAVE. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS THAT ARE WORKING AND IN JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE USING THEM APPROPRIATELY WE'VE SEEN BIG INCREASE AS AN EIGHTY YEARS -- I MEAN THE BIG ONE OF THE BIG TAKE AWAY IS -- AGAIN TO KEEP PICKING ON ON DAVID FROM SANTA ROSA BUT HE SOUGHT SUCH A BIG INCREASE IN EIGHTY PRODUCTION WHEN THE FEET -- LEVELS WERE ABLE TO BE REDUCED SO TO THE X. ANGEL SUPPORT AND INCENTIVES TO REDUCE THEIR FEES SO THAT LEGITIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE CONCERNS CAN STILL BE ADDRESSED WHILE REDUCING THE COST BURDEN TO TO HOMEOWNERS TO PRODUCE EIGHTY YEARS. AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A A GREAT WAY TO HELP ENCOURAGE PRODUCTION -- AND MAYBE EVEN WITH THAT SB TO MONEY USING OTHER -- PROTOTYPES AND THE PRE APPROVED EIGHTY YOU PLANS THOSE THOSE -- THOSE ALL SEEM LIKE SUCCESSFUL MODELS THAT ARE IN THE WORLD ALREADY THAT CAN LEAD TO A FASTER EASIER APPROVED AND LOWER COST EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION SOLUTIONS [inaudible] OTHER THOUGHTS. IN POSSIBLY WELL WE WHAT WE OFTEN YOU DO IS JUST PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW. AND THERE'S SAID AND IT'S DIFFERENT VARIOUS REASONS WHAT WAYS SEE INTERPRETED -- AND SO WE WE WE'RE DOING THAT AND AS THE A BOOKLET THAT WE I THINK YOU ALL HAVE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN MEMORANDUM. IS THAT WE EXPAND ON THAT AND PROVIDE FOR THE CLARIFICATION IN THE IN THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS SECTION. THANK YOU MISSOURI -- I WOULD I WOULD I'D YOU KNOW WE MY STAFF DEALS WITH A LOT OF APPLICATIONS -- ON THE PHONE IS THERE IN TRYING TO BUILD THESE EIGHTY USE AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IT'S IT'S A PROGRAM YOU KNOW WITH WHAT'S THE STATE LAW -- GOVERNING WHERE WE'VE SEEN IT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF EIGHTY IS PRODUCED IN THE CITY -- I THINK WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF A CASE BY CASE SITUATIONS WITH OUR BUILDING CODE IN OUR ZONING CODE WHERE THERE ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE STATE LAW SORT OF SUPERSEDES OUR LOCAL ZONING REGULATIONS AT THIS TIME -- KIND OF BRINGING TOGETHER UP THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED IN STATE LAW AND FIGURING OUT HOW. TO MAKE THEM WORK OUT WITH STATE LAW -- HAS BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND SO I CAN'T REALLY SAY THAT THERE'S A UNIVERSAL. SET OF BUILDING HAD REGULATIONS RESIGNING CUT REGULATIONS THAT YOU KNOW OUR OUR BARRIERS BUT WE DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS -- KIND OF WORKING THROUGH THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES WITH THE APPLICANTS SO -- JUST THINKING ABOUT -- HOW DIFFERENT ZONING REGULATIONS ACROSS THE CITY ARE STRUCTURED RELATED TO PERMITTING AND DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTY IS? COLLEAGUES IN THE FINAL QUESTIONS TO THE PANELISTS MR PER. JUST. A COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME CONTEXT -- AROUND THIS ISSUE AND HOW IMPORTANT -- ACCELERATING THAT -- THE CONSTRUCTION OF AS MANY IDEAS AS POSSIBLE IS -- EIGHTIES ARE NOT -- TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THE COMPARISON IS NOT -- DIRECT IS COSTING GOTCHA OF TEN TIMES LESS SOMETIMES MORE ISN'T SAN FRANCISCO IN MY AREA -- MORE THE MORE OR LESS AN AVERAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT TO BUILD A UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TODAY. EIGHTY USE -- FILL SOME OF THE NEED FOR AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THERE UTILIZED FOR CHILDREN FOR PARENTS -- OFFER A VERY STEEP ON THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A MORE AFFORDABLE -- ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL HOUSING IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING OR WHATNOT --% AND SO WE PUT A LOT OF MONEY -- AROUND THE STATE INTO BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT ONLY CAN ONLY GO SO FAR I WAY OF COMPARISON THE EIGHT THOUGHT NINE ALMOST NINE THOUSAND APPLICATIONS IN LOS ANGELES -- WHICH WE COULD EXTRAPOLATE FOR US STATEWIDE MAYBE HCV AS THE NUMBERS BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. OF A BILLION DOLLARS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONEY -- WILL PAY FOR TWO THOUSAND UNITS. AND HERE WE HAVE A LOT CHANGE THAT'S CREATING CLOSE TO NINE THOUSAND UNITS JUSTIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO KIND OF FOCUS ON THE ECONOMICS OF THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE ARE. SIMPLY CANNOT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO BUILD THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE REALLY NEED IN THE STATE. GOVERNOR -- IS PROMOTING A PLAN TO BUILD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING NOT A NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT IF OF HOUSING -- PER YEAR -- AND TO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO GETTING. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT OTHER MICHAEL I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ONLY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION UNITS OF THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS WHICH IS CLOSER TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS SO IT. YOUR YOUR YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN EXCEPT THE NUMBERS EVEN BIGGER SO EXACTLY -- WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR GREAT -- PRESENTATIONS IF I COULD ASK ALL OF THE WITNESSES TODAY TO PROVE TO PROVIDE TO OUR COMMITTEES YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY WERE HAPPY -- TO PULL THAT TOGETHER GET IT TO ALL OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. I'M GONNA TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY FELLOW CHAIR TO PRESIDE OVER PUBLIC COMMENT. ABOUT. GOOD AFTERNOON ALL THOSE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE -- IT'S TIME FOR PUBLIC TEST TESTIMONY AND LIKELY TO FORM A LINE OVER HERE ON THE RIGHT -- IF YOU COULD KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE AND ALSO REMEMBER THAT YOU ALWAYS CAN SEND EMAILS TO OUR COMMITTEES IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES THAT WE DID NOT ADDRESS A THERE. ARE OTHER CHALLENGES -- WE'D APPRECIATE YOU JUST TELLING US YOUR NAME AND WHO YOU REPRESENT THANK YOU. THE MORNING -- TRACY RYAN THROW COUNTY REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA -- ALSO HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE THESE OTHER URBAN -- COALITION COUNTIES AND THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- JUST A NUMBER OF AREAS OF CONCERN OR ISSUES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION THIS YEAR -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- WE BELIEVE THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NEED GOVERNMENTS NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCRETION OVER LIMITING EIGHTY YOU CONSTRUCTION IN AREAS THAT HAVE REAL PUBLIC -- HAZARDS -- SUCH AS HIGH A FIRE RISK -- IN SIMILARLY WE LIKE TO SEE SETBACK REQUIREMENTS BEING UNDER THE DISCRETION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE SAME REASON. HAVING SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN SOME OF THOSE UNINCORPORATED RURAL AREAS -- PARCEL SIZE WE LIKE TO SEE THAT CONTINUE TO BE -- PART OF THE CONVERSATION. IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND RURAL AREAS PERSONAL SIZES AWAY -- TO ENSURE THAT -- THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY ESPECIALLY WITH SEWER SEPTIC SYSTEMS AND A LOT OF RURAL AREAS WE DON'T HAVE PUBLIC WATER IT'S USUALLY A A SEPTIC SYSTEM. AS YOU KNOW WHY AS PART OF THE BUDGET -- FUNDS FOR REPAIR FOR SEWERS -- AND SO THAT'S A REAL ISSUE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN RURAL AREAS SO WE LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CAN CAN -- CONVERSATION. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS IT HAS BEEN THE PAST THAT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPACTS BETWEEN -- NEW STRUCTURES AND THOSE INCORPORATE INTO ESTABLISH STRUCTURES -- CONTINUES TO BE THERE -- LIKEWISE WITH MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS THE IMPACTS FROM. ADDING EIGHTY USED TO MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS IS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN THOSE IN. A GROUP A GARAGE CONVERSION FOR INSTANCE. LASTLY JUST TO BE VERY BRIEF I THINK TAT WE NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLE DISCUSSION ABOUT FEES I KNOW THIS IS. THE ISSUE THAT MOST OF US HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT I THINK THAT -- WE NEED THAT CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE -- AWAIT THAT WE CAN THE SENATE BUYS -- EIGHTY USE IN AREAS WHERE APPROPRIATE -- BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT EIGHTEEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR CREATE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IT'S NECESSARY -- WE'D ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- OUR CD'S THAT THAT MUST BE OF FUNDED FOR INSTANCE PERMITTING INSPECTIONS AND DOCUMENT RECORDING SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE FUNDED -- AS THEIR ESSENTIAL -- IN CLOSING WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MORNING AROUND ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. FOR THE SAKE OF BREVITY I'VE JUST LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS -- WITH THOSE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM EAST BAY MUD WAS ON THE PANEL EARLIER -- SPECIALLY FOR THE CONNECTION CAPACITY CHARGES THESE FEES ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR WATER AND SEWER DISTRICTS AND THEY ARE VERY MUCH HELP ENABLE. OUR DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE THE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE WATER AND SEWER SERVICE TO THOSE HOMES. ADDITIONALLY FOR OUR PARKING FIRE DISTRICTS THEIR ALSO HEAVILY RELIANT ON THE IMPACT FEES FOR OUR FIRE DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR WITH THE WILD FIRES SPREADING ACROSS THE STATE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE ABLE. TO PURCHASE NEW FIRE TRACKS TO EXPAND THEIR EXISTING FACILITIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ADDITIONAL POPULATION. AND AS WELL FOR PARK THIS ON IMPACT FEES WE'VE ACTUALLY HEARD FROM A FEW OF OUR PARK DISTRICTS THAT THEY RELY ON IMPACT FEES. FOR UP 275% OF THEIR FUNDING IN A GIVEN YEAR STURGIS WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEES FOR TAKING A LOOK AT THESE ISSUES THIS YEAR AND LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. A MANAGER DAVID JONES OF HALF THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE VERY MUCH AND IN SUPPORT OF AB USE THEY LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK IN THE BARRIERS PERSON BY H. AWAY AS WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS THAT WANT TO BUILD. AN H. WAYS OF REPRESENT A LARGE PORTION OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHRIS ANDERSON WITH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT CHAIRS AND STAFF OF BOTH COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY AND I'D LIKE TO CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY EAST BAY MUD IN REGARDS TO A CONNECTION FEES AND CAPACITY CHARGES. THESE FEES REFLECT THE REASONABLE IN PROPORTION ACOSTA PROVIDING AN ACTUAL SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS WHICH APPEARS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE AND PROPOSITION -- TWO EIGHTEEN MAINTAINING THE LANGUAGE AND SB. TEN SIXTY NINE IN REFERENCE TO THESE FEES. WOULD ENSURE PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES CAN ADEQUATE SERVICE THEIR CUSTOMERS WHILE STILL INCENTIVIZING HOMEOWNERS TO MEET THE DEVELOPMENT. MEET ENOUGH EIGHTY IS THAT -- TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING DEVELOPMENT GOALS. AGAIN LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ENGAGING ON THIS ISSUE AN AWKWARD LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JESSICA GEIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES I JUST WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE WATER. AND SEWER CONNECTION CAPACITY CHARGES NOT TO BE A BROKEN RECORD HERE BUT SO AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE THE CONNECTION CAPACITY FEES ARE UNIQUE IN THAT THEY REPRESENT THE COST OF BUYING INTO THE CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM -- AND PAYING FOR THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN THAT A NEW UNIT ADDS TO THE SYSTEM SO THESE ARE ONE TIME FEES THEY REALLY CANNOT BE RECOVERED BY. SHIFTING THE CAPACITY COSTS ON GOING RATES ARE SERVICE CHARGES -- THAT IS PROBLEMATIC UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN IMPROPER. TWENTY SIX IN THAT IT COULD POTENTIALLY CONSTITUTION AND AND LEGAL SUBSIDIZATION OF FEES SO WE ALSO CAN'T JUST ELIMINATE. CASTING CONNECTION FEES BECAUSE THAT ALSO SHIPS THE COSTBURDEN ONTO ANOTHER CLASS OF REPAIRS WHICH IS AGAIN ILLEGAL IN THE CONSTITUTION SO -- WE ARE CONSTRAINED IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE CAN CHARGE CONNECTION IN CAPACITY FEES THIS WAS NEGOTIATED IN SB TEN SIXTY NINE SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO WE CAN ONLY CHARGE A FEE FOR A NEW -- DETACHED UNIT THEM AND THAT HE HAS TO BE PROPORTIONAL -- BASED ON EITHER THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE YEAR NEW UNIT OR THE NUMBER OF PLUMBING FIXTURES IN THE UNIT. SO -- WHEN SB TEN SIXTY NINE SB TWO TWENTY NINE OR AND -- I ENACTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO ARE AGENCIES HAD TO GO BACK REVIEW AND RENEGOTIATE THEIR RATE STRUCTURES TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE -- THOSE NEW PREVENTION SO THE POINT IS WE'RE ALREADY PRETTY CONSTRAINED IN -- WHEN WE CAN CHARGE FEES CAN REMAIN IT'S WHAT THE CONSTITUTION LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OF COMMITTEES -- AS THIS ISSUE PROGRESSES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME'S DON CASEY I'M WITH CALIFORNIA RENTERS LEGAL ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION FUND -- I WORKED PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF HELPING OUT HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO BUILD A TO USE AND WHERE WE SEE A ISSUE WITH COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW ENCOURAGING CITIES. TO BRING THEIR ORDINANCES AND COMPLIANCE -- I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE ISSUES FIRST IS A LOT OF CITIES HAVE AFFECTED BANDS ON EIGHTY USE THROUGH. ADOPTED ORDINANCES AND THEY DO THIS BY PRIMARILY SETBACK REQUIREMENTS A MINIMUM LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS THAT MAKE. MOST OF THE SINGLE FAMILY LOTS IN THAT CITY -- UNABLE TO HAVE EIGHTY USE BUT THEY CAN ALSO DO THROUGH LIVE COVERAGE FLOOR AREA. OR OPEN SPACE RESTRICTIONS -- REQUIREMENTS. AND SECOND AT I THINK A LOT OF CITIES ARE STILL TRYING TO IMPLEMENT DISCRETION REVIEW PROVISIONS. TO REVIEW A FEW APPLICATIONS AND THIS WOULD BE EITHER THROUGH ORDINANCES THAT ARE OUT COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. OR BY WAY OF PROVIDING WAIVERS TO THE THE AFFECTED BANDS THAT I JUST MENTIONED -- THROUGH A LIKE VARIANCE PROCESS OF SOME SORT -- I THINK. IN LOOKING AT THE ISSUES GOING FORWARD LIKE. LIMITING LIMITING THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY BAN EIGHTY YEARS AND ALSO STREAMLINING THE PERMITTING REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. LAST THEY JUST WANT -- TO ECHO THE CONCERNS ABOUT FEES THAT WERE EXPRESSED EARLIER -- I THINK THE CHALLENGE THERE IS MOSTLY IN. LIMITING THE CITIES OF THE WORST OFFENDERS HAVE THE THE HIGHEST FEES -- THANKS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONVERSATIONS GOING PORT. GOOD MORNING SAYS AND NOT AN ACT HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE CONVERSATION TODAY -- HABITAT FOR HUMANITY ACTUALLY BILLS AT USE IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS A FEW OF OUR AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN BUILDING LOW INCOME DEED RESTRICTED EIGHTY USE -- BUT MANY HAVE EXPRESSED FEES BEING A LARGE BIRD AND I KNOW THERE WAS A CONVERSATION TODAY ABOUT AFFORDABLE EIGHTY USE AND HOW -- THOSE ARE MOVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- MANY OF OUR AFFILIATES HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BUILDING ADDITIONALLY TO USE. TO HOUSE MORE THAN JUST ONE FAMILY IN MANY INSTANCES BUT HAVE EXPRESSED THAT FEES -- HAVE BEEN A LARGE BURDEN FOR THEM AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OCCURRING. IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS -- WAIVERS OR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL -- TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD MORE EIGHTY USE AND ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE IT USE THANK YOU. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER SIXTY MUNICIPALLY OWNED ELECTRIC AND WATER UTILITIES ROUND THE STATE ALL ALIGNER COMMENTS WITH THE SANITATION DISTRICTS IN AQUA THANK YOU. AT LUIS BRONTE WITH CALIFORNIA BE I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEES FOR THEIR FOCUS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. EIGHTY USE CAN BE A A BELOW MARKET RATE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMENSURATE -- MARKET RATE OF WHAT WELL BOTH WOULD BE MARGAERY BUT AT IS ARE ARE USUALLY CHEAPER THAN COMMENDABLE MARKET RATE UNITS IN PART IN BUILDING SO THEY CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY BOTH FOR FOR NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS WELL AS AN OPTION FOR FOR PURSUE MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS -- DEFINITELY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FEE ISSUE THIS YEAR AND IN THAT THE ISSUES AROUND ALLOWING OWNER OCCUPANCY THOSE ARE BIG CHALLENGES FOR BUILDING EIGHTY USING LOTS OF COMMUNITIES. NOT NOT IN NOT IN CERTAIN PLACES BUT IN IN IN SOME CITIES WE SEE EXCESSIVE FEES. PARK IMPACT FEES FOR EXAMPLE OF OF FORTY TO SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT -- WHICH ARE REALLY JUST INTENDED NOT NOT TO MITIGATE FOR IMPACT BUT TO REALLY CURB DEVELOPMENT THERE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY HOMEOWNERS THAT THE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BY CITIES A CAN OFTEN LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL BECAUSE BANKS GET REALLY SKITTISH. WHEN THEIR DEED RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE ASSET AFTER IT'S BEEN BUILT? THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A BIG BIG CHALLENGE. WERE SYMPATHETIC TO THE THE THE THE CONCERNS FROM A CITIES LIKE SANTA ROSA WHICH REQUIRE CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF AFFORDABILITY -- FOR WAITING THAT OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT BUT I THINK THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND THERE TO STRIKE BETWEEN CITIES THAT HAVE THOSE THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS. THAT ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN ALSO ALLOWING SIT AT FOLKS WHO LIVE IN MORE BAD ACTORS CITIES THAT WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL ISSUES. AS AGAIN JUST WANTED THINK COMMITTEES FOR THEIR FOCUS ON IS REALLY IMPORTANT HOUSING STRATEGY AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THAT THAT SIMPLY -- GOING FORWARD. GOOD MORNING AGAIN TIM SU FOR SPEAKING AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FROM SAN FRANCISCO. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE THIS ON YOUR LIST IS THAT BANKING CRITERIA IN THE PAST HAS PENALIZED. IN EIGHTY YOU -- SPEAKING FROM OUR X. YOU ARE ELEVATED FROM THE LOWEST COST LENDING WHEN YOU GO FROM A SINGLE FAMILY TO WHAT OFTENTIMES THE BANKS CONSIDER A MULTI UNIT BUILDING. SO YOU DON'T GET THAT LOWEST RATE WE WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THAT WERE WE WERE KICKED UP INTO A HIGHER RATE OF FINANCING WHICH ON THE FACE OF IT MAKES NO SENSE BECAUSE THE ADDITION OF THE EIGHTY YOU PROBABLY ADDED. CONSERVATIVELY MANY SIX FIGURES TO THE APPRAISED VALUE OF OUR OF OUR HOME SO SOMETHING FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THE CLOSES PUBLIC COMMENT ODD JUST A COUPLE OF FINAL COMMENTS ON MY PART -- THERE WERE A FEW COMMENTERS WHO MENTIONED THE IMPACT OF SETBACKS AND LOT AREAS.
