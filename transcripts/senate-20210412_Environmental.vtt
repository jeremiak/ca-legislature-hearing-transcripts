SEPARATE ON ITS OWN. AND THAT'S

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.247
WHY IT'S SIX FORTY THREE IS

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:30.416
NEEDED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:33.286

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:20.597
THAT SENATOR GONZALEZ IS

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:22.499
FOCUSING IN ON SOMETHING THAT

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.034
HAS COME BEFORE BAYERN MENTAL

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:26.036
QUALITY COMMITTEE ALL THE SINCE

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.838
THE TIME I'VE SERVED ON IT-

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:29.106
WITH THOSE WHO LIVE IN ALL

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:30.741
THESE AREAS THAT ARE OF A VERY

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:32.943
HIGHLY POLLUTED BUT THEY ALSO

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.911
ROOM- PRESENTED A CONCERNED

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:36.847
ABOUT BALANCE ENSURING THAT

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.415
SOME OF THE REGULATIONS THAT

HAVE IMPACTED IN THE ECONOMY

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.422

I'LL DO TODAY IS I'M GONNA LAY

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.159

SOME TIME WITH THE OPPOSITION

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:52.229
LOOKING FOR A BALANCE HERE AND

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.764
I THINK THAT THAT'S THE ONLY

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:54.498
THING THAT'S MISSING BECAUSE I

00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:55.932

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.534
PARTICULAR ONE I REMEMBER SO

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.803
CLEARLY HE CAME FROM SOUTH

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.672
CENTRAL LA WHERE I USED TO WORK

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:03.473
AS A SOCIAL WORKER AND IT WAS

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.741
SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THEY WERE

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:05.809
TRYING TO DO BUT HE SAID IT WAS

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.511
REALLY THE UNDERTAKEN ENOUGH

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:09.680

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:11.415
GIVING AUTHORITY TO A ARE B.

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:14.151

WORKING. AS ONE OF THE SUPPLY

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:07.902

WHICH IS A SUPPLY CHAIN AMONG

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.662
OTHER THINGS BUT PRIMARILY

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:37.298
BECAUSE MY JAM. THAT IS A VERY

01:25:37.365 --> 01:25:37.932
IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL IN

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.767
THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY DID AN

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:42.971
EXELLENT JOB- EXPLAINING WHY-

01:25:43.037 --> 01:25:43.938
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.773
BILL. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:52.413
THE SCOPE THREE SUPPLY. CHAIN

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.682
AT ALL- ASPECTS INCLUDE. A

01:25:54.749 --> 01:25:57.519
COMPANY CAN BASIC. CON OUT ITS

01:25:57.585 --> 01:25:59.220
CURRENT BOOK FOR. AND HAVE IT'S

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.922
HIS CALL. ACTUALLY BE THE

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.423
CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:03.925
COMPANY ITSELF LOOKS VERY PURE

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.194
AND GREEN- BUT MEANWHILE THE

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.930
RELYING ON SUPPLIERS. WHO ARE

01:26:08.997 --> 01:26:10.932
BURNING COAL OR DOING-

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.368
WHATEVER- SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:14.669
THE COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO WORK

01:26:14.736 --> 01:26:16.771
WITH THEIR SUPPLIERS- TO DO

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:19.173
THAT BUT WE DO THINK IT'S AN

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.042
IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL. I

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.410
JUST THINK THE AMOUNT OF

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.212
OPPOSITION ON A COUPLE OF THOSE

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.980
ISSUES SO CENTER TO WINNER AND

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.882
I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHERE YOU

01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:29.217
WANT TO GO AND VERY VERY

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:31.185
IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY CONCEPT

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.154
BUT- I THINK IT NEEDS A LOT OF

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.389
WORK IN TERMS OF THE

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:35.523
PROTECTIONS THAT SHOULD BE

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.658
THERE FOR THAT KIND OF DATA

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:37.525
COLLECTION YOU'RE PUTTING ON

01:26:37.592 --> 01:26:39.928
THE BACKS OF. SMALL AND MEDIUM

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:41.729
IN PARTICULAR SMALL BUSINESSES

01:26:41.796 --> 01:26:43.464
THAT THAT WILL BE PART OF AN

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:45.700
OVERALL WILL BE IMPACTED BY ANY

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:48.703
OVERALL- MISINFORMATION THAT'S

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:50.438
PROVIDED YOUR DATA THAT'S NOT

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:53.908
ACCURATE. SO AB I DON'T THINK I

01:26:53.975 --> 01:26:55.243
CAN SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT THAT

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.811
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T THINK

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.413
YOU'RE HEADED IN THE DIRECTION

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:02.684
TRY TO GET THIS ALL INTO PLACE

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:03.217
SO WE CAN MAKE SOME BETTER

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:03.985
POLICY- AND I. APPRECIATE THAT

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:06.788
I JUST WANNA- THAT YOU KNOW

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:09.390
THIS BILL OF COURSE. DOESN'T

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:11.893
REQUIRE THE COMPANIES. TO

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.428

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:21.729
OBVIOUSLY PUSHING DOWN ON THOSE

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.564
TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY'RE

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:24.198
REPORTING ARE SO LET'S TAKE FOR

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:27.535
EXAMPLE. MY COMPANY I PRODUCE

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:30.672
SEED FOR OTHER FARMERS- AND IT

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.140
GOES UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND

01:28:32.206 --> 01:28:34.909
NURSE. IT COULD BE. IT COULD GO

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:36.644
TO ARCHER DANIEL MIDLANDS WHICH

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.211
IS A BILLION DOLLAR.

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:40.081
CORPORATION AND THEN THEY WOULD

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.316
REQUIRE ME TO DO THIS WORK SO

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.351
THAT THEY CAN REDO THE

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:44.485
REPORTING AND SO THE TRICKLE

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:45.453
DOWN EFFECT WOULD ACTUALLY

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.889
IMPACT EVERY BUSINESS IN

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:48.489
CALIFORNIA THAT DOES BUSINESS

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:50.692
WITH. LARGE CORPORATIONS IS

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:55.263
THAT CORRECT- IT DOES APPLY TO

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:57.565
ANYONE IS PROVIDING ENERGY- TO

01:28:57.632 --> 01:29:00.535
ACCOMPANY- AND IT ALSO APPLIES

01:29:00.601 --> 01:29:02.403
TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND SO IT

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:03.571
WOULD AFFECT OTHER COMPANIES

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:04.205
THEY ON'T HAVE BUT THOSE

01:29:04.272 --> 01:29:06.407
COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:09.177
REPORT- THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:10.578
BE AUDITED THEY WOULDN'T BE

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:13.047
THEY CAN BE PENALIZED BY CAR

01:29:13.114 --> 01:29:14.182
THAT WOULD ONLY BE THE COVERED

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:16.217
BILLION DOLLAR PLUS ENTITIES-

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:17.285
BUT OFFICES AND THESE ARE GOING

01:29:17.351 --> 01:29:19.287
TO WORK WITH THEIR SUPPLIERS.

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:19.921
TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT

01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:21.522

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:23.825

WE NEED TO DO TO FIGHT CLIMATE

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:27.762
CHANGE THAT THE WORLD DOESN'T

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:30.631
CONTINUE TO BURN UP. SO IT

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:31.833
WOULD IMPACT MY BUSINESS I

01:29:31.899 --> 01:29:33.134

MITIGATION. AND THE REDUCTION

FOSSILIZED FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:34.126

SIX YEARS FROM WILDFIRES ALONE.

02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:45.571
A TESTIMONY DIRECTLY FROM THIS

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:47.006

OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS THE T.

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.115
WORD WAS USED- TO TALK ABOUT

02:00:56.182 --> 02:00:57.683
THE SCALE THIS IMPACT AND IT'S

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:59.819
ABOUT REAL PEOPLE TO. FEMA'S

02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:01.954

RISK INDEX FOR THE ANALYZED WHO

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:10.062
WOULD SUFFER FROM DISASTER. AND

02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.796
IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE SAME

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:12.398
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFERING

02:01:12.465 --> 02:01:13.899
FROM ALL THE OTHER DISASTERS

02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:15.668
WE'VE HAD WHETHER IT'S THE WILD

02:01:15.735 --> 02:01:17.837
FIRES OR THE PANDEMIC. SENIORS

02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:19.572
AND THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH

02:01:19.639 --> 02:01:21.407
DISABILITIES PEOPLE STRUGGLING

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:23.142
WITH POVERTY. PEOPLE WHO DON'T

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:24.543
LIVE NEAR RESOURCES LIKE WHAT

02:01:24.610 --> 02:01:26.012
WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HERE IN

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.947
THE PAST BILL OF CLEAN WATER.

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:30.316
ACCESS TO AIR CONDITIONING AND-

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:32.551
AND COOLING AND HEATING. I'M

02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:33.352
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:34.587
SUFFER MOST OF THE PREMISE OF

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:35.921
THIS BILL IS THAT THE CURRENT

02:01:35.988 --> 02:01:38.457
TRAJECTORY OF CLIMATE DISASTER

02:01:38.524 --> 02:01:40.426
IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE AND

02:01:40.493 --> 02:01:42.428
THEREFORE INHERENTLY UNJUST.

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:44.163
AND THAT THE CURRENT TRACK WERE

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:47.166
ON UNDER THE SB THIRTY TWO AB

02:01:47.233 --> 02:01:47.933
THREE NINETY EIGHT FRAMEWORK

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.771
TO. REDUCE EMISSIONS 40% BELOW

02:01:51.837 --> 02:01:53.072
NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:53.939
TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS CURRENT

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:57.243
LAW. IS SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT.

02:01:57.309 --> 02:02:00.146
THE E. U. ITSELF ADOPTED A 55%

02:02:00.212 --> 02:02:02.081
TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE U.

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:04.817
K. IS ON TRACK 468% REDUCTION

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:06.919
TARGET SO WE'RE ALREADY BEHIND

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:08.988
OUR PARTNERS TO THE EAST.

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:10.723
CONGRESS ITSELF IS LOOKING AT A

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:13.225
BILL TO. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:15.861
50% BY TWENTY THIRTY. TO ME

02:02:15.928 --> 02:02:16.696
ACTUALLY BEHIND THE U. S.

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:19.031
CONGRESS AND I DON'T THINK OF

02:02:19.098 --> 02:02:19.565
CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:22.034
LEAVES FROM BEHIND. SO THIS

02:02:22.101 --> 02:02:24.637
BILL. INITIALLY SETS OUT THE

02:02:24.704 --> 02:02:27.239
AMBITIOUS BUT I BELIEVE QUITE

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:29.575
ACHIEVABLE GOAL OF DOUBLING OUR

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:31.610
EFFORTS OVER THE NEXT DECADE.

02:02:31.677 --> 02:02:34.346
BUT THE SECOND PREMISE. IS THAT

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:36.382
VIRGIN THE PATH WE'RE ON IS

02:02:36.449 --> 02:02:38.918
TOWARDS RESTORATION. IT'S NOT

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:41.220
SIMPLY TOWARDS MITIGATION THAT

02:02:41.287 --> 02:02:42.521
IF WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY

02:02:42.588 --> 02:02:43.456
FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WE

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:44.824
ACTUALLY HAVE TO REVERSE IT AT

02:02:44.890 --> 02:02:46.425
THE CURRENT LEVEL OF EMISSIONS

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:47.827
IN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF WARMING

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:49.228
WHICH WILL LAST FOR CENTURIES

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:50.696
IS GOING TO CAUSE SECTION JUST

02:02:50.763 --> 02:02:52.164
IS THAT THE ONLY JUST THING TO

02:02:52.231 --> 02:02:53.733
DO IS TO ACTUALLY TURN THINGS

02:02:53.799 --> 02:02:55.601
AROUND AND START TO REVERSE THE

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:57.436
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:59.739
SO THAT. THE NOTION OF CLIMATE

02:02:59.805 --> 02:03:01.207
RESTORATION IS SOMETHING THAT

02:03:01.273 --> 02:03:02.575
IS NEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:04.076
IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SUBMIT

02:03:04.143 --> 02:03:04.610
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.779
COMMITTEE IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY

02:03:06.846 --> 02:03:08.314
TO CONCEIVE OF JUSTICE IS THE

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.282
LENS THROUGH WHICH WE ADVANCE

02:03:10.349 --> 02:03:13.052
CLIMATE ACTION- IT'S NOT ENOUGH

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:15.955
TO JUST ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO

02:03:16.021 --> 02:03:17.423
PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT NOW. IN

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:19.125
ORDER TO DO THAT THOUGH. OUR

02:03:19.191 --> 02:03:20.860
PATH ALSO HAS TO BE JUST INTO

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.194
THE THIRD PIECE OF THIS BILL IS

02:03:22.261 --> 02:03:24.163
ABOUT RESILIENCE. ANGLING THE

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.765
STATE'S EFFORTS ON BOLSTERING

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:27.700
IN ADAPTING AND- HARDENING OUR

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:29.068
WAY. THROUGH THIS CLIMB

02:03:29.135 --> 02:03:30.870
DISASTER ALSO HAS TO BE JUST WE

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:32.171
HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:33.839
NOW TO. SPEND GREENHOUSE GAS

02:03:33.906 --> 02:03:35.074
REDUCTION FUNDS IN THE MOST

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:36.175
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:38.244
BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE

02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:39.578
ONES WHO ARE HURT MOST FIRST.

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:41.113

THE COMING OUT OF PARIS THE

02:20:54.379 --> 02:20:57.816
ACCORD SAID- SEPARATED CLIMATE

02:20:57.882 --> 02:21:00.385
ADAPTATION AT ABOUT 17%

02:21:00.451 --> 02:21:02.587
OBVIOUSLY AB THIRTY TWO DIDN'T

02:21:02.654 --> 02:21:06.357
ALLOW THAT A. B. SB THIRTY TWO

02:21:06.424 --> 02:21:08.760
DOES ALLOW A DOES ALLOW WITH-

02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:11.095
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT WORLDWIDE

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:13.565
GOAL WITH THE- RESTORATION

02:21:13.631 --> 02:21:16.835
RESILIENCY THAT YOU'RE- PUTTING

02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:18.770
FORTH NOW. I THINK I THINK WHAT

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.338
WE'RE PROPOSING HERE SLIGHTLY

02:21:20.405 --> 02:21:23.141
DIFFERENT IN THAT. BUT THE AIM

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:24.709
IS NOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:29.314
MAKE- CARBON REMOVAL OR

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.316
ADAPTATION EFFORTS NECESSARILY

02:21:31.382 --> 02:21:33.585
COUNT TOWARDS THE MITIGATION

02:21:33.651 --> 02:21:35.987
GOAL IN THE SAME WAY SO BUT

02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:38.623
THAT. BY PUTTING RESOURCES

02:21:38.690 --> 02:21:41.759
AGENCY WHICH HERETOFORE HAS NOT

02:21:41.826 --> 02:21:43.595
REALLY HAD THE BIN IN THE

02:21:43.661 --> 02:21:46.097
DRIVER'S SEAT ON. OUR CARBON

02:21:46.164 --> 02:21:48.766
STRATEGY- AND TO SORT OF

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:50.869
ESTABLISH A PROCESS THROUGH

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:54.572
THAT ARCHITECTURE- IT'S A

02:21:54.639 --> 02:21:56.307
PROPOSAL YOU KNOW I I'M I'M

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:58.109
OPEN TO ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE

02:21:58.176 --> 02:21:59.811
ROLE FOR INSTANCE ON A PATH TO

02:21:59.878 --> 02:22:01.880
CARBON NEUTRALITY THAT CERTAIN

02:22:01.946 --> 02:22:03.448
TYPES OF MITIGATION EFFORTS

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:04.349
PLAY BUT AS YOU KNOW THEY

02:22:04.415 --> 02:22:05.950
BELIEVE BETWEEN MITIGATION AND

02:22:06.017 --> 02:22:08.052
ADAPTATION RIGHT. I THINK I

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:09.120
THINK FINDING THAT LINE TO BE

02:22:09.187 --> 02:22:10.154
REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY THE

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:11.823
NATURAL WORKING LAND SPACE I

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:13.558
THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO RAISE THE

02:22:13.625 --> 02:22:15.260
TENSION THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE

02:22:15.326 --> 02:22:16.661
CERTAIN ACTS THAT ARE

02:22:16.728 --> 02:22:18.396
MITIGATION ACTION IN A NATURAL

02:22:18.463 --> 02:22:20.131
WORKING ON AN ADAPTATION AND

02:22:20.198 --> 02:22:21.699
HOW WOULD THAT WORK I DON'T

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:22.667
THINK WE HAVE THAT ANSWER

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:24.369
SORTED OUT YET BUT I WANTED TO

02:22:24.435 --> 02:22:26.971
SEND THE SIGNAL OF A- SOME KIND

02:22:27.038 --> 02:22:31.309
OF- COROLLARY AND DEFENSIBLE

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:33.311
FRAMEWORK ON ITS OWN TO RIDE IN

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:34.879
PARALLEL NOT TO BE SEPARATE

02:22:34.946 --> 02:22:36.514
DECISION THE SCOPING PLAN NOT

02:22:36.581 --> 02:22:37.248
TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:39.617
SCOPING PLAN BUT- TO HAVE. NOT

02:22:39.684 --> 02:22:41.286
THE AIRBOARD DRIVING BUT REALLY

02:22:41.352 --> 02:22:43.922
THE AGENCY OVERSEEING ALL THE

02:22:43.988 --> 02:22:47.492
RESEARCH SIDE. OKAY I'M- MORE

02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:50.561
ON PAGE. TO PAGE SIX WE TALK

02:22:50.628 --> 02:22:52.664
ABOUT THE CARBOMER NO OPTIONS

02:22:52.730 --> 02:22:53.965
THIS IS A QUESTION ASIAN

02:22:54.032 --> 02:22:57.502
BIOMASS CONVERSION. ARE YOUR

02:22:57.568 --> 02:23:00.405
SPONSORS- AND I GUESS YOU ARE

02:23:00.471 --> 02:23:03.808
PREPARED TO. SUPPORT ALL THE

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:05.643
CAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:07.211
OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN

02:23:07.278 --> 02:23:09.047
ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:10.715
THERE ARE THE I DON'T NEED TO

02:23:10.782 --> 02:23:12.450
TELL YOU THERE ARE SOME CARBON

02:23:12.517 --> 02:23:14.419
SEQUESTRATION STEP WILL REDUCE

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:16.421
CARBON THAT THERE'S A LOT OF AS

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:18.022
I LOOK DOWN THE SCOREBOARD OF

02:23:18.089 --> 02:23:18.990
PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTING

02:23:19.057 --> 02:23:21.092
THIS. WOULD SAY OH NO DON'T DO

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:23.261
THAT YEAH WE WANT THIS LAUDABLE

02:23:23.328 --> 02:23:24.996
GOAL BUT DON'T DO THAT SO I'M

02:23:25.063 --> 02:23:26.397
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ON

02:23:26.464 --> 02:23:28.299
THE SAME PAGE HERE YOU'RE SO

02:23:28.366 --> 02:23:30.568
RIGHT TO RAISE IT AND I AGREE I

02:23:30.635 --> 02:23:32.437
THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE AREAS

02:23:32.503 --> 02:23:35.373
THAT MAKE ME. ANXIOUS IS AS

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:38.643
OPENING SALVOS- I DON'T THINK

02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:41.112
THAT THE FIRST MOVING PROJECTS

02:23:41.179 --> 02:23:42.447
SHOULD BE AREAS WHERE THE

02:23:42.513 --> 02:23:43.381
SCIENCE IS UNCERTAIN BUT ALSO

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:45.616
WHERE THEIR- COULD BE DIRECT

02:23:45.683 --> 02:23:46.951
EMISSIONS REDUCTION DIRECT

02:23:47.018 --> 02:23:49.520
EMISSIONS POTENTIAL IN ACTUAL

02:23:49.587 --> 02:23:51.689
FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES SO

02:23:51.756 --> 02:23:53.658
REFINING THE DEFINITION OF

02:23:53.725 --> 02:23:55.059
CARBON REMOVAL AND THAT

02:23:55.126 --> 02:23:57.128
RESTORATION FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE

02:23:57.195 --> 02:24:00.565
THAT. I THEIR PRIORITIZATION IS

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:04.402
PUT IN HERE OR OR SOME KIND OF

02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:07.372
ABILITY TO- ENSURE THAT THERE

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:11.209
IS NO SE- NET EMISSIONS

02:24:11.275 --> 02:24:12.643
INCREASE IN A COMMUNITY OR

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:13.778
ACTUALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE

02:24:13.845 --> 02:24:15.980
IS A COROLLARY NET EMISSIONS

02:24:16.047 --> 02:24:17.815
DECREASE SOME ABILITY SAY YES

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:19.317
YOU'RE REMOVING CARBON BUT CAN

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:20.752
YOU ALSO ASSOCIATE THAT WITH

02:24:20.818 --> 02:24:22.253
SOME KIND OF LOCAL EMISSIONS

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.155
BENEFIT I THINK THOSE KINDS OF

02:24:24.222 --> 02:24:26.090
METRICS WHICH WILL HELP US.

02:24:26.157 --> 02:24:28.059
REFINE IT BUT I WILL TELL YOU

02:24:28.126 --> 02:24:29.394
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE ANSWERS

02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:31.562
YET I MEAN I GET IT IT'S NICE

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.331
THE NICE TO TALK ABOUT WORKING

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:35.233
LANDS AND EVERYBODY ALL ALL THE

02:24:35.299 --> 02:24:36.467
SPONSORS EVERYBODY'S ARE UP

02:24:36.534 --> 02:24:37.769
THERE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:39.170
EMISSIONS THAT ARE GOING ON THE

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:40.304
COVERED ENTITY'S AND THE CAP

02:24:40.371 --> 02:24:42.707
AND TRADE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE

02:24:42.774 --> 02:24:46.544
TO GET THE. GREEN LIGHT TO SAY

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:47.578
YOU CAN JUST. CAPTURE A CARBON

02:24:47.645 --> 02:24:49.013
FIBER SMALL. AND THEN PUT IT IN

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:51.449
A ABANDONED OIL WELL AND IT BE

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:53.451
PEOPLE BUT JUST SO WE'RE WE'RE

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:54.452
SURE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:56.020
IF WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN THAT

02:24:56.087 --> 02:24:57.722
ZERO AND NEGATIVE WE'RE GOOD

02:24:57.789 --> 02:24:59.590
WE'RE AND WE'RE USING ALL THE

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:06.764
TOOLS- ON. THE VULNERABILITY-

02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:09.100
PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST AND ON THE

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:12.203
ON THE- THE CLIMATE IMPACTS I

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:15.440
AGES. FOOD FOR THOUGHT I KNOW

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:17.408
IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE A LOT

02:25:17.475 --> 02:25:20.011
OF SEA LEVEL RISE DISCUSSIONS

02:25:20.078 --> 02:25:22.613
ARE GOING ON IN YES WHEN WE

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:24.515
HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE THEY WILL

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:27.919
FLOOD THE LOW LAYING AREAS

02:25:27.985 --> 02:25:29.387
WHICH TEND TO BE DISADVANTAGED

02:25:29.454 --> 02:25:31.522
COMMUNITIES OR AREAS THAT HAVE

02:25:31.589 --> 02:25:33.024
TO BE REPRESENTED BY ME BUT PUT

02:25:33.091 --> 02:25:35.626
THAT ASIDE SOME OF THE

02:25:35.693 --> 02:25:38.463
SOLUTIONS ARE- BUILDING A

02:25:38.529 --> 02:25:39.730
BRIDGE AND TAKING OUT SOME

02:25:39.797 --> 02:25:41.199
LEVEES THAT WERE THERE THAT

02:25:41.265 --> 02:25:43.468
THAT ACTUAL WORK WILL NOT BE

02:25:43.534 --> 02:25:45.203
GOING ON IN A IF PER SE.

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:47.071
VULNERABLE COMMUNITY BUT THE

02:25:47.138 --> 02:25:49.340
BENEFIT OF THE WORK WE GO AND I

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:51.676
JUST WANT TO THE AS WE LOOK AT

02:25:51.742 --> 02:25:55.213
THESE BIG IDEAS- IT THAT THAT

02:25:55.279 --> 02:25:57.315
ANY AND THEIR REGIONAL AND YOU

02:25:57.381 --> 02:25:59.016
MIGHT NOT WE MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE

02:25:59.083 --> 02:26:00.785
BEYOND THE COUNTY AND THE AND

02:26:00.852 --> 02:26:02.353
THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE

02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:05.423
SAYING THIS IS THIS IS. WHAT

02:26:05.490 --> 02:26:06.791
WILL BENEFIT ME AND I WOULD SAY

02:26:06.858 --> 02:26:09.927
THE MILK MAYBE A BIGGER

02:26:09.994 --> 02:26:14.232
PROJECT- I GUESS AND- I ALSO

02:26:14.298 --> 02:26:16.067
SUGGESTED TO THE CRITICS THAT

02:26:16.134 --> 02:26:19.203
SAY WE CAN'T GET A SPENDING

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:20.838
PACKAGE RIGHT NOW THAT IS

02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:22.440
PUTTING US ON TARGET TO REDUCE

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:24.075
OUR GREENHOUSE GASES BY 40%

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:25.810
WEEK WE CAN'T WE'RE SPENDING A

02:26:25.877 --> 02:26:27.812
BUNCH OF MONEY ON THE LAUDABLE

02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:30.214
THINGS. THAT ARE NOT REDUCING

02:26:30.281 --> 02:26:31.182
CARBON AND WE GOT YOU KNOW IN

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:33.518
FACT THIS MEMBERS IS COMMITTEE

02:26:33.584 --> 02:26:35.686
OR TIRE LISTEN TO ME TALK ABOUT

02:26:35.753 --> 02:26:37.054
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CARBON

02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:38.689
REDUCTION AND POLLUTION WHICH

02:26:38.756 --> 02:26:41.692
IS ALL PROBLEMS- WHAT DO YOU

02:26:41.759 --> 02:26:43.227
SAY TO THE CRITICS THAT SAY WHY

02:26:43.294 --> 02:26:44.629
THIS IS AMBITIOUS IN THE SENSE

02:26:44.695 --> 02:26:48.099
OF COMMITMENT. IT'S NOT THE

02:26:48.166 --> 02:26:52.036
NUTS AND BOLTS TYPE OF. THE

02:26:52.103 --> 02:26:53.704
ACTIONS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE

02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:56.007
FROM THE 40% CLIMATE-

02:26:56.073 --> 02:26:56.607
REDUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT

02:26:56.674 --> 02:27:00.144
NOW. I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT IN

02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:04.215
THAT IF WE KEEP SPENDING. AND

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:05.383
INVESTING THE WAY WE ARE

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:07.952
CURRENTLY WON'T BE ENOUGH H. A.

02:27:08.019 --> 02:27:09.720
W. N. N. AS WE BROUGHT UP IN

02:27:09.787 --> 02:27:12.557
THE HEARING YOU HAD WITH THE

YOU DO THE AMERICAN JOBS PLAN

02:27:25.770 --> 02:27:27.271
MATH WE'RE ACTUALLY ON TRACK

02:27:27.338 --> 02:27:28.239
FOR FIVE BILLION A YEAR IF IT

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:29.907
ACTUALLY IF WE GOT ONE FIFTIETH

02:27:29.974 --> 02:27:32.843
OF THE MONEY. FIVE X. THAT KIND

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:37.548
OF. SCALE OF INVESTMENT AND I

02:27:37.615 --> 02:27:38.416
WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ON

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:40.384
WILDFIRE RIGHT WE WERE ABOUT TO

02:27:40.451 --> 02:27:42.019
SEND A DEAL FOR HALF A BILLION

02:27:42.086 --> 02:27:43.354
DOLLARS I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE

02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:45.556
A LOT OF MONEY FIVE X. I MEAN

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE

02:27:47.124 --> 02:27:47.625
HAVEN'T DONE THAT EXACT MATH

02:27:47.692 --> 02:27:50.761
BUT- THAT SCALE OF INVESTMENT

02:27:50.828 --> 02:27:51.562
IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE

02:27:51.629 --> 02:27:52.463
REQUIRED TO GET THERE AND I

02:27:52.530 --> 02:27:53.898
DON'T THINK WE'VE- WE FIGURED

02:27:53.965 --> 02:27:56.067
OUT HOW TO BE. AMBITIOUS WITH

02:27:56.133 --> 02:27:57.802
OUR OWN CURRENT SCALE SO I GET

02:27:57.868 --> 02:27:59.203
THAT IT'S PUSHING US BEYOND

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:00.371
THAT BUT- THIS CAN'T JUST BE

02:28:00.438 --> 02:28:01.572
DONE BY REGULATION AND NOT

02:28:01.639 --> 02:28:02.940
ALONE I MEAN THAT THAT AMERICAN

02:28:03.007 --> 02:28:05.910
JOBS PLAN. AND A MAJOR MAJOR

02:28:05.977 --> 02:28:08.613

THINK THAT YOU YOU YOU BRING IT

02:37:07.317 --> 02:37:08.752
UP AND SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS IS

02:37:08.819 --> 02:37:10.554

SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

03:01:24.707 --> 03:01:25.774

I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT I DON'T

03:01:38.387 --> 03:01:39.822
DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT

03:01:39.888 --> 03:01:42.524
FACT I DID A RECYCLING BILL

03:01:42.591 --> 03:01:44.460

I THINK THAT ARE. OUTRAGEOUS

03:01:58.374 --> 03:01:59.408
AND WHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY

03:01:59.475 --> 03:02:00.609
WE GOT TO GET THE JOB DONE WE

03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:01.844
GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:03.879
HAVING FIRES AND THAT AND WE

03:02:03.946 --> 03:02:07.049
HAVE A- REASONABLE. AMOUNT OF.

03:02:07.116 --> 03:02:09.084
THE OF THE CONSUMER BUY IN

03:02:09.151 --> 03:02:10.919
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

YOU JUST HAPPEN TO IT TO

03:02:12.921 --> 03:02:14.223

HAVE YOU. IF THE ANSWER TO ME

03:02:20.029 --> 03:02:20.896
HOW WE GONNA STOP THE FIRES.

03:02:20.963 --> 03:02:22.331
THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN

03:02:22.398 --> 03:02:23.532
YOU IF YOU THROW THESE ALL IN

03:02:23.599 --> 03:02:25.100
THE SAME BAND YOU HAVE

03:02:25.167 --> 03:02:27.603
OPPORTUNITY FOR FIRE. AND SO

03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:29.571
WHAT'S THE THOUGHT PROCESS ON.

03:02:29.638 --> 03:02:30.906
THAT WOULD BASICALLY WHERE DOES

03:02:30.973 --> 03:02:32.107
SHIFTING LIABILITIES WHAT I

03:02:32.174 --> 03:02:34.276
HEARD THE TESTIMONY OF AND I'M

03:02:34.343 --> 03:02:35.044
NOT INTERESTED IN SHIFTING

03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:36.378
LIABILITY I'M INTERESTED IN

03:02:36.445 --> 03:02:37.680
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN

03:02:37.746 --> 03:02:39.315
ACTUALLY CYCLE IS VERY SAFELY.

THAT SIR. SO I DON'T THINK THE

03:02:46.722 --> 03:02:47.890
INTENT HERE IS NOT TO SHIFT

03:02:47.956 --> 03:02:50.125
LIABILITY IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S

03:02:50.192 --> 03:02:51.260
PROBABLY NOT TO CREATE AN

03:02:51.327 --> 03:02:53.329
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. RACHEL

03:02:53.395 --> 03:02:54.229
IS SO I WOULD KIND OF

03:02:54.296 --> 03:02:56.432
STIPULATED THIS IS A HARD

03:02:56.498 --> 03:02:57.900
PROBLEM TO SOLVE. RIGHT I MEAN

03:02:57.966 --> 03:02:59.568
AS AS I THINK I MENTIONED MY

03:02:59.635 --> 03:03:02.137
TESTIMONY. THESE PRODUCTS ARE

03:03:02.204 --> 03:03:04.606
UBIQUITOUS- AND IF THERE IS NO

03:03:04.673 --> 03:03:05.674
CENTRALIZED SYSTEM AT THE

03:03:05.741 --> 03:03:06.709
MOMENT THAT IS WORKING CLEARLY

03:03:06.775 --> 03:03:09.011
IT IS NOT WORKING- IF WE'RE

03:03:09.078 --> 03:03:10.179
GETTING ELEVEN BATTERY LITHIUM

03:03:10.245 --> 03:03:12.715
ION BATTERIES PER HOUR IN IN

03:03:12.781 --> 03:03:14.116
WASTE. MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.

03:03:14.183 --> 03:03:15.417
BACK TO MISTER GOVERNOR'S POINT

03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:17.152
ABOUT- YOU KNOW SOME BATTERIES

03:03:17.219 --> 03:03:18.120
BEING TOO LARGE THAT THE YOU

03:03:18.187 --> 03:03:19.988
KNOW DO YOU CAN DESIGN PROGRAMS

03:03:20.055 --> 03:03:21.390
THAT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT-

03:03:21.457 --> 03:03:23.125
YOU CAN ALSO DESIGN PROGRAMS

03:03:23.192 --> 03:03:24.760
WERE THOSE. THE BINS WILL BE

03:03:24.827 --> 03:03:26.428
EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS SO

03:03:26.495 --> 03:03:27.663
WOULD PREVENT. YOU KNOW THOSE

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:31.166
SORTS OF- RISKY SCENARIOS. BUT

03:03:31.233 --> 03:03:32.735
THIS IS A CLEAR IT'S A WORK IN

03:03:32.801 --> 03:03:35.904
PROGRESS. WHERE WE START IS TO

03:03:35.971 --> 03:03:37.239
YOUR POINT WE YOU KNOW WE'VE

03:03:37.306 --> 03:03:37.706
GOT A PROBLEM THAT IS

03:03:37.773 --> 03:03:39.208
DESPERATELY IN NEED OF.

03:03:39.274 --> 03:03:41.410
ADDRESSING IN CALIFORNIA THE

03:03:41.477 --> 03:03:42.745
ANSWER WE'VE BEEN GLAD TO WORK

03:03:42.811 --> 03:03:44.646
WITH. ALL STAKEHOLDERS SO FAR

03:03:44.713 --> 03:03:46.081
GLAD TO CONTINUE DOING THAT I

03:03:46.148 --> 03:03:47.182
THINK THAT'S THAT'S COMMON TO

03:03:47.249 --> 03:03:48.250
THE EXPERIENCE OF MOST OF THE

03:03:48.317 --> 03:03:50.652
CPR PROGRAMS- THAT IT'S AN AREA

03:03:50.719 --> 03:03:52.354
PROCESS AND MY GOAL AT THE END

03:03:52.421 --> 03:03:53.856
OF THE DAY IS TO GET. TO A

03:03:53.922 --> 03:03:55.057
POINT WHERE MANUFACTURERS

03:03:55.124 --> 03:03:57.393
ESPECIALLY BUT ALSO RETAILERS.

03:03:57.459 --> 03:03:58.794
CAN UNDERSTAND- AND

03:03:58.861 --> 03:04:03.732
PARTICIPATE. IN A PROGRAM IT

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:04.366
MAKES SENSE TO THEM AS WELL. SO

03:04:04.433 --> 03:04:05.567
WITH MADE HOW HOW DO YOU JUST.

03:04:05.634 --> 03:04:08.270
OF YOU BABY- GOT A CALL. I

03:04:08.337 --> 03:04:11.540
GUESS MAYBE NEED LIKE THE WORD.

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:13.075
LIABILITY TRANSFER BUT YOU

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:14.309
BASICALLY ARE SAYING TO THE

03:04:14.376 --> 03:04:17.346
MANUFACTURE AND TO THE RETAILER

03:04:17.413 --> 03:04:17.980
THAT THEY GOT TO DEAL WITH IT

03:04:18.046 --> 03:04:20.983
INSTEAD OF AT THE- AT THE-

03:04:21.049 --> 03:04:23.252
WASTE RECEIVING A POINT. WHAT

03:04:23.318 --> 03:04:24.853
CHART I MEAN DIDN'T ALWAYS

03:04:24.920 --> 03:04:26.422
BETTER TO MAKE THEIR WAY YOU

03:04:26.488 --> 03:04:27.956
KNOW TO SOME SORT OF WASTE

03:04:28.023 --> 03:04:29.758
MANAGEMENT PROCESS WHAT WE

03:04:29.825 --> 03:04:30.826
DON'T WANT IS FOR THEM TO BE

03:04:30.893 --> 03:04:32.428
INTERMINGLED YOU KNOW WITH

03:04:32.494 --> 03:04:34.730
COMMON HOUSEHOLD TRASH- AND SO

03:04:34.797 --> 03:04:35.898
THAT'S THE EIGHT THINK THAT'S

03:04:35.964 --> 03:04:37.733
INHERENT IN THE DESIGN HERE SO

03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:40.068
I IT YEAH I DON'T WANT TO GET

03:04:40.135 --> 03:04:41.737
IN ARGUMENTS SEMANTICS BUT WE

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:42.237
DO WE DO WANT TO SHIFT

03:04:42.304 --> 03:04:44.440
RESPONSIBILITY- YOU KNOW HAVE

03:04:44.506 --> 03:04:45.374
LIABILITY COMES WITH THAT I

03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:46.842
THINK WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM

03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:48.444
PROPERLY THAT WE CAN WE CAN

03:04:48.510 --> 03:04:51.980
ADDRESS QUESTIONS OF LIABILITY

03:04:52.047 --> 03:04:52.548
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO

03:04:52.614 --> 03:04:53.749
UNDUE EXPOSURE. SO THIS IS THE

03:04:53.816 --> 03:04:54.950
POLICY COMMITTEE WHERE WE TALK

03:04:55.017 --> 03:04:57.286
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS AND THEN

03:04:57.352 --> 03:04:59.655
AND- SO FOR THE DETAIL OF IT WE

03:04:59.721 --> 03:05:01.323
DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH. TROUBLE

03:05:01.390 --> 03:05:02.958
UNTIL WE HAD AYE ON LITHIUM

03:05:03.025 --> 03:05:05.194
WHICH IS WHAT'S CAUSING. IT

03:05:05.260 --> 03:05:09.031
TYPICALLY IF YOU PUT. THE EVER

03:05:09.097 --> 03:05:10.999
READY FLASHLIGHT BATTERY.

03:05:11.066 --> 03:05:13.502
BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONES THAT

03:05:13.569 --> 03:05:15.070
REALLY CAUSES TIME THAT THE IN

03:05:15.137 --> 03:05:17.039
THAT REALLY BECAUSE OF THE

03:05:17.105 --> 03:05:18.974
FIRES AND SO NOW WE HAVE

03:05:19.041 --> 03:05:20.309
MIXTURE OF ALL THOSE IN IS

03:05:20.375 --> 03:05:21.510
BECAUSE AND THISWAS WHERE WE

03:05:21.577 --> 03:05:23.445
TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS

03:05:23.512 --> 03:05:24.446
BILL ACTUALLY PILLS THE TWO

03:05:24.513 --> 03:05:27.883
THOUSAND AND- SIX. RECYCLING

03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:29.718
MANDATE THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE

03:05:29.785 --> 03:05:32.488
AND SO. I THINK WE'RE I THINK

03:05:32.554 --> 03:05:33.956
THIS NEEDS SOME WORK IS WHAT

03:05:34.022 --> 03:05:35.190
I'M TRYING TO SAY I DON'T THINK

03:05:35.257 --> 03:05:37.559
WERE I THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS

03:05:37.626 --> 03:05:41.463
SOME LEGITIMATE- SADISTIC THAT

03:05:41.530 --> 03:05:42.931
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND I. AND

03:05:42.998 --> 03:05:43.999
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SHIFTING

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:45.167
LIABILITY I'M INTERESTED IN

03:05:45.234 --> 03:05:47.002
ACTUALLY GETTING THE JOB DONE.

03:05:47.069 --> 03:05:49.338
AND IF IT'S EDUCATING-

03:05:49.404 --> 03:05:50.706
SOMETHING ON PACKAGING THAT

03:05:50.772 --> 03:05:52.341
SAYS HEY THIS HAS AYE ON THE

03:05:52.407 --> 03:05:53.976
THEME BATTERY IN IT CAN'T BE SO

03:05:54.042 --> 03:05:55.210
I'M SURE THAT'S ALREADY THERE.

03:05:55.277 --> 03:05:56.445
BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING SO WE

03:05:56.512 --> 03:05:58.313
NEED TO DO AN EDUCATION.

03:05:58.380 --> 03:05:59.815
PROCESS TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL

03:05:59.882 --> 03:06:01.650
THAT THESE CAN BECAUSE THEY

03:06:01.717 --> 03:06:02.985
THEY ARE CAUSING FIRES I SHOULD

03:06:03.051 --> 03:06:05.587
SAY. BUT IT ALL WE'RE DOING IN

03:06:05.654 --> 03:06:06.154
MY OPINION THIS BILL IS JUST

03:06:06.221 --> 03:06:09.725
TRANSFERRING. WHERE THE FIRES

03:06:09.791 --> 03:06:10.359
ARE GONNA START EITHER GUNFIGHT

03:06:10.425 --> 03:06:11.393
STARTED TO. RETAILER WHETHER

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:12.861
RECYCLING THERE OR THEY'RE

03:06:12.928 --> 03:06:14.696
GOING TO AND START AT THE PLACE

03:06:14.763 --> 03:06:15.631
WHERE THEY'RE YOU KNOW LEVIN

03:06:15.697 --> 03:06:17.966
TODAY SO FOR ME I'M A NO. UNTIL

03:06:18.033 --> 03:06:19.001
WE GET A LITTLE BETTER DETAIL

03:06:19.067 --> 03:06:20.035
AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO

03:06:20.102 --> 03:06:21.837
BRING ALONG THE MANUFACTURERS.

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:23.772
AND THE RETAILERS- IN THIS

03:06:23.839 --> 03:06:25.207
CONVERSATION I'M NOT FAMILIAR

03:07:36.044 --> 03:07:38.647
PRESCRIPTIVE ON I'M ON PAGE

03:07:38.714 --> 03:07:39.915
THREE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS

03:07:39.982 --> 03:07:41.583
THAT YOU KNOW THE RETAILERS

03:07:41.650 --> 03:07:43.518
WERE FEASIBLE. SERVICE AN

03:07:43.585 --> 03:07:45.020
AUTHORIZED COLLECTOR SO I GUESS

03:07:45.087 --> 03:07:46.455
EQUIPMENT THE OBVIOUS QUESTION

03:07:46.521 --> 03:07:48.323
IS ONE WITH A RETAIL OUTLET NOT

03:07:48.390 --> 03:07:50.492
BE FEASIBLE TO COLLECT

03:07:50.559 --> 03:07:52.828
BATTERIES. WHAT DO YOU ENVISION

03:07:52.894 --> 03:07:54.696
THAT THEY WOULD DO IT AND THEN

03:07:54.763 --> 03:07:57.165
WHY WOULD YOU NOT ALLOW THE

03:07:57.232 --> 03:07:59.935
STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM THE PEOPLE

03:08:00.002 --> 03:08:02.004
TESTED TO GO CRAZY I MEAN

03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:04.239
THERE'S- NOT NOT GEARING IT

03:08:04.306 --> 03:08:06.208
TOWARDS NEEDLES AND SAY OKAY WE

03:08:06.274 --> 03:08:06.842

REQUIREMENTS AND WHO'S GOING TO

03:08:08.310 --> 03:08:10.278
HANDLE THEM. BUT BRING THEM TO

03:08:10.345 --> 03:08:11.613
YOUR CHURCH YOUR SYNAGOGUE OR

03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:13.181
TEMPLE WHATEVER YOU GET

03:08:13.248 --> 03:08:14.850
WHATEVER YOU GOT TO COLLECT

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:16.585
THESE THINGS SCHOOLS WHY WOULD

03:08:16.652 --> 03:08:18.086
YOU NOT WHAT WHY WOULD YOU NOT

03:08:18.153 --> 03:08:20.989
HAVE MET TO SCHOOLS SO. THAT'S

03:08:21.056 --> 03:08:22.524
WHAT IS NOT FEASIBLE ABOUT THE

03:08:22.591 --> 03:08:24.259
RETAILERS I GUESS THE WAY I'M

03:08:24.326 --> 03:08:26.094
READING THE TEXT I'M SORRY THE

03:08:26.161 --> 03:08:26.895
SENATE WOULD WHAT IS NOT

03:08:26.962 --> 03:08:29.598
FEASIBLE- PROVIDED SOME LEEWAY

03:08:29.665 --> 03:08:31.900
FOR. IN A PROGRAM DEFINITION

03:08:31.967 --> 03:08:33.335
BUT I DATE I THINK IT'S PRESUME

03:08:33.402 --> 03:08:35.137
THAT YOU KNOW MOST RETAILERS

03:08:35.203 --> 03:08:36.505
WHO DEAL AND LET THE LION OF

03:08:36.571 --> 03:08:38.073
THE BATTERIES. WOULD WOULD BE

03:08:38.140 --> 03:08:39.641
PRESUMED THESE FEASIBLE RIGHT

03:08:39.708 --> 03:08:40.842
THE MINUTE THEY DO YOU KNOW

03:08:40.909 --> 03:08:42.811
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IS TO

03:08:42.878 --> 03:08:44.146
CREATE AN END TO END SYSTEM

03:08:44.212 --> 03:08:47.115
THAT HAS BALANCE NOT UNLIKE

03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:47.849
THAT YOU DON'T PLEASE DON'T

03:08:47.916 --> 03:08:50.285
HOLD IT AGAINST ME- YOU KNOW

03:08:50.352 --> 03:08:52.154
THE RECYCLING OF BOTTLES. THAT

03:08:52.220 --> 03:08:53.288
AND SO I YOU KNOW THE

03:08:53.355 --> 03:08:54.556
DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING

03:08:54.623 --> 03:08:55.524
BETWEEN THE NEW PROGRAM AND

03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:57.926
THIS PROGRAM. NO I WOULD ARGUE

03:08:57.993 --> 03:08:59.194
IS THE SORT OF INCIDENTAL WHAT

03:08:59.261 --> 03:09:00.696
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A

03:09:00.762 --> 03:09:02.764
DRESS. A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHERE

03:09:02.831 --> 03:09:03.432
YOU HAVE THE UBIQUITOUS

03:09:03.498 --> 03:09:06.201
PRODUCT- AND THERE'S NO YOU

03:09:06.268 --> 03:09:07.035
KNOW SORT OF LIKE BALANCE

03:09:07.102 --> 03:09:09.805
NETWORK THAT THAT THAT EXISTS

03:09:09.871 --> 03:09:11.273
TO ENSURE YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR

03:09:11.339 --> 03:09:13.075
ULTIMATE DISPOSAL RIGHT THROUGH

03:09:13.141 --> 03:09:13.742
YOU KNOW THROUGH THE PRODUCT

03:09:13.809 --> 03:09:15.711
LIFECYCLE TO. DATE THE RETURN

03:09:15.777 --> 03:09:18.246
OF SOME YOU KNOW SAFE DISPOSAL

03:09:18.313 --> 03:09:20.382
MECHANISM. AND SO I DO I DO

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:21.983
APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE ALLOWED

03:09:22.050 --> 03:09:22.951
THAT YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM INTO

03:09:23.018 --> 03:09:24.019
DANCE IS NOT GONNA CAUSE A

03:09:24.086 --> 03:09:25.120
FIGHT EVERY TIME THAT'S NOT

03:09:25.187 --> 03:09:26.555
WHAT CAUSES THE FIRES. WHAT

03:09:26.621 --> 03:09:27.756
CAUSES THE FIRES AS THEIR

03:09:27.823 --> 03:09:28.924
INTERMINGLED WITH WITH OTHER

03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:31.693
KINDS OF. WASTE AND THEN THEIR

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:33.361
CRUSHER OTHERWISE DAMAGED BUT

03:09:33.428 --> 03:09:35.163
IT'S AND I ALSO POINT OUT THAT

03:09:35.230 --> 03:09:35.764
DID YOU KNOW THIS MAY BE THE

03:09:35.831 --> 03:09:37.466
IMPETUS FOR SOLVING THIS

03:09:37.532 --> 03:09:39.334
PROBLEM BUT BUT OTHER KINDS OF

03:09:39.401 --> 03:09:40.202
BATTERY KIND OF CONVENTION THAT

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:41.870
RISK. POSED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT

03:09:41.937 --> 03:09:43.972
OF ENVIRONMENTAL DANGER RIGHTS

03:09:44.039 --> 03:09:46.641
OF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. WITH

03:09:46.708 --> 03:09:47.075
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM

03:09:47.142 --> 03:09:56.118
COLLECTIVELY AND SO- YOU KNOW

03:09:56.184 --> 03:09:57.285
THE STATE TO YOUR POINT OF AT

03:09:57.352 --> 03:09:58.820
STATE WHAT YOU PLAN. BY A KNOW

03:09:58.887 --> 03:09:59.387
THIS IS A PAUL COMMITTEE WE

03:09:59.454 --> 03:10:00.856
HAVE BEEN. TO WORK WITH- ALL.

03:10:00.922 --> 03:10:02.157
VERTICALLY UP. TO GET TO. OF

03:10:02.224 --> 03:10:03.291
GOTTEN THERE YET BUT- YOU KNOW

03:10:03.358 --> 03:10:04.259
MORE THAN TO GET TO DOING SO

03:10:04.326 --> 03:10:07.262
THIS THIS WILL GO TO- ARE- THE

03:10:07.329 --> 03:10:08.396
OTHER HOUSING WILL CONTINUE

03:10:08.463 --> 03:10:10.766
WORKING ON IT THAT'S THAT IS NO

03:10:10.832 --> 03:10:11.399
DIFFERENT THAN THE EXPERIENCE I

03:10:11.466 --> 03:10:13.468
THINK WITH TWO TWELVE. I TO MY

03:10:13.535 --> 03:10:15.804
POINT WAS THAT NEEDLES AND

03:10:15.871 --> 03:10:17.005
SYRINGES HAVE A CERTAIN

03:10:17.072 --> 03:10:18.540
LIMITATION. AND MODELING THE

03:10:18.607 --> 03:10:19.908
PROGRAM AFTER THAT THAT HAS

03:10:19.975 --> 03:10:21.910
LIMITATION I DON'T BELIEVE

03:10:21.977 --> 03:10:23.712
THAT. THE COLLECTION OF THE

03:10:23.779 --> 03:10:25.447
BATTERIES WUNSCH SEGREGATE THEM

03:10:25.514 --> 03:10:27.649
FROM OTHER HARMFUL. AND THE-

03:10:27.716 --> 03:10:29.151
THE PICK UP IN THE STEWARDSHIP

03:10:29.217 --> 03:10:30.819
PROGRAM CAN DESIGN THAT IS

03:10:30.886 --> 03:10:32.821
GOING TO CREATE. A HARM DEBT

03:10:32.888 --> 03:10:34.356
THAT I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW

03:10:34.422 --> 03:10:35.190
YOU'RE ALSO NOT SOLVING THE

03:10:35.257 --> 03:10:36.758
PROBLEM RIGHT IF THEY IF

03:10:36.825 --> 03:10:37.759
THEY'RE STILL DECENTRALIZED

03:10:37.826 --> 03:10:38.760
RADIANCE OF THE YOU KNOW

03:10:38.827 --> 03:10:39.661
THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS TO IT

03:10:39.728 --> 03:10:41.196
CONSIDERS THE SAFETY. BUT

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:41.963
THERE'S ALSO CREATING A

03:10:42.030 --> 03:10:44.032
CENTRALIZED SYSTEM. RIGHT WHERE

03:10:44.099 --> 03:10:45.400
AND DOES DOES PRODUCTS GET RE

03:10:45.467 --> 03:10:46.802
DIRECTED TOWARD YOU KNOW SOME

03:10:46.868 --> 03:10:48.403
DID YOU KNOW DISPOSAL SOURCE.

03:10:48.470 --> 03:10:50.272
SO IF YOU JUST ASSUME THAT'S

03:10:50.338 --> 03:10:51.606
AFFECTING WHAT WE DO NOW WE

03:10:51.673 --> 03:10:52.941
KNOW THAT CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS

03:10:53.008 --> 03:10:54.276
WILL HAVE. IN RENO ABOUT

03:10:54.342 --> 03:10:56.044
ELECTRONIC RECYCLING CAMPAIGNS

03:10:56.111 --> 03:11:00.081
IT IS. NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM.

03:11:00.148 --> 03:11:00.816
RIGHT NOW. THAT SERVICE IS

03:11:00.882 --> 03:11:02.484
ATTEMPTED THAT ON A GONNA MORE.

03:11:02.551 --> 03:11:04.619
NATURE OF SYSTEMIC. OKAY ON

03:11:04.686 --> 03:11:06.488
PAGE FOUR OF OUR STAFF REPORT

03:11:06.555 --> 03:11:10.058
UNDER J. FOR TALKING ABOUT THE-

03:11:10.125 --> 03:11:12.027
EPA'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:11:12.093 --> 03:11:16.298
TASK FORCE. AND RECYCLING IN

03:11:16.364 --> 03:11:17.499
AREAS AND COMMUNITIES THAT FACE

03:11:17.566 --> 03:11:19.501
UNIQUE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED

03:11:19.568 --> 03:11:22.304
WITH PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT.

03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:25.240
WHAT DO WHAT'D. UNDER THIS

03:11:25.307 --> 03:11:27.008
SYSTEM WHAT WITH THAT WHAT WHAT

03:11:27.075 --> 03:11:29.778
DOES HE NEED CHALLENGES BE. BUT

03:11:29.845 --> 03:11:32.380
THEN THEY JUST DON'T RECYCLE. I

03:11:32.447 --> 03:11:33.648
MEAN THAT MIGHT HAVE CHALLENGE

03:11:33.715 --> 03:11:35.417
CHALLENGE THAT WAS JUST A MAY

03:11:35.483 --> 03:11:37.519
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO- THE SAME

03:11:37.586 --> 03:11:38.653
KIND OF WASTE MANAGEMENT

03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:39.454
PROGRAMS WE DO THEM AND HAVE

03:11:39.521 --> 03:11:41.523
ACCESS TO RETAILERS SO AS AN

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:43.124
EXAMPLE THAT THAT CONTINUE KEPT

03:11:43.191 --> 03:11:45.393
UP CAME UP- MOST THE FOLKS HERE

03:11:45.460 --> 03:11:46.461
IN THE CAPITAL GET USED TO

03:11:46.528 --> 03:11:47.929
RECYCLING OF BATTERIES HERE.

03:11:47.996 --> 03:11:49.097
RIGHT THERE WAS THE BEEN BY THE

03:11:49.164 --> 03:11:51.066
ELEVATOR AND SO WHEN THE

03:11:51.132 --> 03:11:53.235
CAPITAL WAS CLOSED NOBODY KNEW

03:11:53.301 --> 03:11:55.003
WHERE TO TAKE THEIR BATTERIES

03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:56.004
YEAH AND I THINK YOU HAVE YOU

03:11:56.071 --> 03:11:56.838
HAVE THAT PROBLEM IN MANY

03:11:56.905 --> 03:11:57.839
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY THEY

03:11:57.906 --> 03:11:59.040
SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THERE IS NO

03:11:59.107 --> 03:11:59.908
OBVIOUS EVEN IF THERE'S NO

03:11:59.975 --> 03:12:02.043
OBVIOUS DESTINATION SO THE GOAL

03:12:02.110 --> 03:12:03.979
IS. TO WORK WITH US COMMUNITIES

03:12:04.045 --> 03:12:05.947
THERE'S A BROADER- COMPONENT OF

03:12:06.014 --> 03:12:07.315
PUBLIC EDUCATION AWARENESS

03:12:07.382 --> 03:12:08.550
THAT'S THAT'S EXPRESSLY

03:12:08.617 --> 03:12:10.552
PROVIDED FOR IN THE BILL YEAH

03:12:10.619 --> 03:12:11.553
AND SO WE WOULD DO THOSE THINGS

03:12:11.620 --> 03:12:13.388
TO TRY AGAIN TO DESIGN A SYSTEM

03:12:13.455 --> 03:12:15.690
EFFECTIVELY FROM SCRATCH. THAT

03:12:15.757 --> 03:12:19.794
THAT ADDRESSES. THIS THIS VERY

03:12:19.861 --> 03:12:21.162
CHALLENGING PROBLEM. RIGHT NOW

03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:23.365
I'M JUST SAY I. YOUR HAVE. THE

03:12:23.431 --> 03:12:25.166
PRODUCERS EXTEND CREATE A

03:12:25.233 --> 03:12:26.534
PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT

03:12:26.601 --> 03:12:29.004
EASY COLLECTED AT EVERY EVERY

03:12:29.070 --> 03:12:30.772
PLACE SO I ASSUME THAT THE SAME

03:12:30.839 --> 03:12:32.374
TYPE OF COLLECTIONS IN THE

03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:34.609
GROCERY STORES OR THE CHURCHES

03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:37.178
WERE IF IT WERE TO GO TO- GET

03:12:37.245 --> 03:12:38.947
EXTENDED TO OTHERS. DEREK I WE

03:12:39.014 --> 03:12:40.048
WANT TO CREATE REGIONAL

03:12:40.115 --> 03:12:41.750
INCENTIVES FOR PRODUCERS TO

03:12:41.816 --> 03:12:48.790
REACH OUT. TO THEM. FOR

03:12:48.857 --> 03:12:55.030
RECYCLING. OKAY THAT'S ALL I

03:12:55.096 --> 03:13:04.739
HAVE MISTER. OKAY- WE ASK YOU

03:13:04.806 --> 03:13:06.107
WHAT WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT WHAT

03:13:06.174 --> 03:13:07.842
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS D. C.

03:13:07.909 --> 03:13:11.413
MODEL AND SENATOR AND WHAT WE

03:13:11.479 --> 03:13:13.481
MIGHT GET A LEARN FROM THEM I

03:13:13.548 --> 03:13:14.049
KNOW IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT

03:13:14.115 --> 03:13:18.320
ALREADY BUT- SO YOU KNOW IT

03:13:18.386 --> 03:13:21.423
MIGHT. EXPERIENCES FOR

03:13:21.489 --> 03:13:23.058
MICROSERVICES FOLKS WHO WOULD

03:13:23.124 --> 03:13:26.094
BE A WE THE SUPPORTERS MY

03:13:26.161 --> 03:13:28.363
OFFICE VIEWS THE DC MODEL AS A

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:29.698
GOOD REFERENCE POINT IN ANALOG

03:13:29.764 --> 03:13:31.766
AYE AYE I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE

03:13:31.833 --> 03:13:32.934
MISTER GOVERNOR FIRST TO THAT

03:13:33.001 --> 03:13:34.703
DID YOU KNOW THEY PROPOSED

03:13:34.769 --> 03:13:35.470
SOMETHING EQUIPMENT TO IT WE

03:13:35.537 --> 03:13:37.505
DID AND WE REJECTED OUT OF HAND

03:13:37.572 --> 03:13:38.673
I THINK QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS

03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:40.608
TRUE- WE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A

03:13:40.675 --> 03:13:43.011
GOOD REFERENCE POINT- AND SO

03:13:43.078 --> 03:13:44.479
THE OTHER PROBABLY DIFFERENCES

03:13:44.546 --> 03:13:45.313
THAT ARE INTRINSIC TO

03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:47.449
CALIFORNIA- BUT WE'RE IN A

03:13:47.515 --> 03:13:48.483
WOULD LIKE TO WORK VERY HARD

03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:50.018
AND INTERRUPTING SOMETHING

03:13:50.085 --> 03:13:50.819
THAT'S APPROPRIATE OR STATE

03:13:50.885 --> 03:13:55.223
THAT. DIED IN MERE IS A SUCCESS

03:13:55.290 --> 03:13:57.726
THE SCENE TO SHOOT. BLACKROCK

03:13:57.792 --> 03:13:59.427
HOW DO YOU BRING YOU CAN YOU.

03:13:59.494 --> 03:14:01.629
OKAY I MEAN I KNOW ALL THESE

03:14:01.696 --> 03:14:02.230
ALL THESE BILLS ARE WORK IN

03:14:02.297 --> 03:14:02.864
PROGRESS AND AGO SHE ARE ALWAYS

03:14:02.931 --> 03:14:05.500
TRICKY- CERTAINLY HOPE YOU CAN

03:14:05.567 --> 03:14:06.267
CONTINUE TO HAVE A FRUITFUL

03:14:06.334 --> 03:14:09.804
DIALOGUE. AS A THING WAS A LONG

03:14:09.871 --> 03:14:12.107
TERM- I'M BY MALES TIME
