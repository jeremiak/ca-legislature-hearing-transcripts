00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:16.095
ON. THAT IN- PRIOR- WORD

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.330
INITIATIVES HAVE HAD

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:20.333
SHORTCOMINGS AND THIS. THIS

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.435
PROPOSAL. HAS SOME SIMILAR-

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:23.970
ISSUES ONE SHORTCOMING IS THAT

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.805
THE PROPOSAL WOULD. PROVIDE

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.907
RELATIVELY LARGE SUMS TO A SMALL

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.575
NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS WITHOUT ANY

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:30.409
CLEAR MECHANISM FOR

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.678
DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES AND

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:34.747
WE HAVE A RELATED CONCERN THAT

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.616
THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT PROVIDE A

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.718
CLEAR PLAN FOR SUSTAINING. AND

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:40.486
SCALING THE SELECTED ACTIVITIES

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:41.687
DISSEMINATING THE ACTIVITIES

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.089
MORE BROADLY COULD POTENTIALLY

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.423
CREATE CONSIDERABLE FUTURE COST

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.525
PRESSURES FOR THE STATE. AND WE

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.327
REYES ALSO CONCERNS THAT-

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.329
REWARDING EXISTING ACTIVITIES

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:52.164
HAS LIMITED ADDED VALUE- FINAL

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.165
CONCERNS SPECIFIC TO THIS

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.268
PROPOSAL WHICH IS- IT IT HAS A

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.903
BROADER SCOPE THAN PRIOR WORD

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:58.738
PROPOSALS RANGING FROM HIGHER

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.239
EDUCATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.674
ANY OTHER AREA OF INTEREST THE

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.975
ADMINISTRATION. AND THIS LACK OF

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.176
FOCUS ON THE CERTAINLY WOULD

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.444
UNDERMINE THE INITIATIVES

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.914
ABILITY TO MEANINGFULLY IMPACT

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.216
ANYONE AREA THE BROAD SCOPE ALSO

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:11.150
MEANS THE PROGRAM LIKELY

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.685
OVERLAPS WITH OTHER EXISTING

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:14.453
STATE EFFORTS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.922
STATE HAS FUNDED RESEARCH ON

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:19.992
CLIMATE RELATED. ISSUES THROUGH

00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:20.893
OTHER PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.028
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COM ON

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.896
THESE I BUT I HAPPY TO. ANY

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:24.563
OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU

SIMULTANEOUSLY SERVE ON RULES

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:47.586
WHICH IS HAPPENING AT THE SAME

00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:49.422
TIME RIGHT ABOVE US SO THERE MAY

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.823
BE MOMENTS WHEN I HAVE TO STEP

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.558

THIS ONE I HAD A REALLY HARD

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:18.918
TIME UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT

00:10:18.985 --> 00:10:21.587
WAS. ANTICIPATED IN THE LEARNING

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.223
LAB PORTION OF THE OF THE GRANT

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.259
PROPOSAL- I KNOW IT PEDAGOGICAL

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:29.261
MEANS BUT WHEN WE START TALKING

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:32.264
IN. IN FACT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:33.933
MAKE SURE THAT THE TERMS ARE

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.635
UNDERSTANDABLE NOT ONLY FOR US

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:37.970
BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC THE TAKES A

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:40.339
LOOK AT THIS AND SAYS- I THINK

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:42.108
INNOVATION GRANTS ARE TERRIFIC.

00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:44.443
BUT BUT I REALLY AM INTERESTED

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.945
IN WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES THAT

00:10:46.012 --> 00:10:47.913
WE'RE EXPECTING FROM DOING THESE

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.283
GRANTS I'M AND I THINK A LOT OF

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.186
TIMES WE CREATE. PROGRAMS AND WE

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:56.188
DON'T HAVE STATED WHAT THE

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:56.822
OUTCOMES ARE AND I'M GONNA START

00:10:56.889 --> 00:11:00.059
ASKING- THAT QUESTION A LOT MORE

00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:01.694
IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I'M NOT

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.662
SURE WE'RE GETTING GOOD BANG FOR

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:05.197
THE BUCK FOR WHAT WE'RE SPENDING

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.166
IN MANY IN MANY AREAS INSTANCES

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:09.635
IN AREAS SO I'M UP TOTALLY

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:13.172
COMMITTED TO STEM RESEARCH AND

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:17.810
UP. UP UP. CELEBRATING YOU KNOW

00:11:17.877 --> 00:11:19.578
VICTORIES BUT FOR EXAMPLE THERE

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.781
WAS A PROGRAM THAT THAT FOCUSED

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.450
ON STEM. AND ONE OF THE GRANTS

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.951
WENT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE A

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:28.154
CREATED A THREE YEAR COMPUTER

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.056
SCIENCE BE A PROGRAM WITH A

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:33.526
LOCAL- CSU AND SO THAT HEADS AS

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:35.661
SOME REAL OUTCOMES AND SOME REAL

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.397
SUCCESS STORIES. BECAUSE OF THAT

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:40.466
THAT THAT PROGRAM WAS. WAYS IT

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.268
COULD BE BETWEEN A COMMUNITY

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:44.303
COLLEGE IN SALINAS SENSE AND

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.739
THAT. CAL STATE MONTEREY BAY AND

00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:50.009
THEY TOOK. YOUNG PEOPLE FROM OUR

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.744
COMMUNITY AND WITHIN THREE YEARS

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.978
AHEAD OF WORKING IN THE SILICON

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.847
VALLEY EARNING OVER A HUNDRED

00:11:54.914 --> 00:11:56.882
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND A

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:58.117
MAJORITY OF THOSE WERE LIKE YOU

00:11:58.184 --> 00:11:59.685
KNOW. AND AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:01.787
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT HAVE

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:04.924
BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT- BEFORE SO

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.559
THAT HAS AN OUTCOME AND SO I'M

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:09.795
I'M I'M INTERESTED IN IN IN THAT

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:12.998
KIND OF- DETAIL AT WHEN WE WHEN

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.633
WE START TALKING ABOUT. ABOUT

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.936
THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. THANK

00:12:17.002 --> 00:12:19.705
YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RON

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.275
QUESTION OKAY- I WOULD JUST LIKE

00:12:23.342 --> 00:12:27.113
SENATOR NIELSEN IF I MAY THIS IS

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:29.348
COME TO MIND THE- THIRTEEN

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:31.050
MILLION DOLLARS OR P. R.'S

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:34.386
BECOME QUITE A- IN MY TERM.

00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:37.056
BLOATED BUREAUCRACY. IT HAD A

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.191
VERY NARROW PURPOSE FOR MANY

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:42.128
YEARS AND NOW IT'S GONE WAY

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:46.198
BEYOND THAT IN MY OPINION. NOW

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.367
ONE OF THE PROPOSALS IS THE

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:58.043
LEARNING LAB. AND. SOME OF THE.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.112
ROOT CAUSES OR STEM ISSUES.

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:03.949
AMONG GROUPS. I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:06.318
THIS IS GOING TO DEAL WITH IT.

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:09.655
THE QUESTION I HAVE THEN WHY

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:12.191
WOULD WITH WHAT JUSTIFIES.

00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:14.393
MAKING THE THIRTEEN MILLION ON

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.229
GOING FUNDING. YOUR PERMANENT

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:20.866
OBLIGATION OF OUR BUDGET WHY WHY

00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:23.435
IS THAT NECESSARY. CAN SOMEONE

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:26.572
FINANCE GIVE ME A THOUGHT. THANK

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.507
YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER ALL

00:13:28.574 --> 00:13:30.176
ALL JUST CLARIFY THAT SORT

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:31.644
PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.646
BUDGET IS FOR THREE MILLION

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:37.016
ONGOING. FOR THE LEARNING LAB

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:38.951
WHICH IS B. AS YOU SAID BASTED

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:42.087
OPR THE TWO MILLION WOULD TWO

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.523
MILLION OF THAT THREE WOULD BE

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.792
TO RESTORE A DRAMATIC BUDGET

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.527
CUTS THE RESULTED FROM THE

00:13:48.594 --> 00:13:50.362
TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT- SO

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.464
THAT'S THAT'S OUR- OUR VIEW IS

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.266
THAT THAT'S NEEDED TO BRING THE

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.101
PROGRAM UP TO WHERE IT WAS WHEN

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.204
IT WAS AN INVASION. SO THERE IS

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.673
AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION THEY

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.641
WERE PROPOSING TO AUGMENT THAT

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.678
WOULD BE TO FIND A PROGRAM THAT

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:07.880
IS CURRENTLY COME OUT OF THE

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:10.683
EXISTING CELL GRANTS. AND WE SEE

00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:12.484
AS A GREAT SUCCESS IT'S

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:15.988
SPECIFICALLY WOULD MAKE LOWER

00:14:16.055 --> 00:14:18.891
DIVISION CHEMISTRY COURSES-

00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:21.126
BASICALLY HELP TEXTBOOK COSTS

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.395
FALL O ALMOST ZERO MAKE THE

00:14:23.462 --> 00:14:26.498
MORE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND-

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:28.601
BE DESIGNED IN A NEW- INNOVATIVE

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.537
WAY THAT'S GONNA HELP- PROMOTE

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.173
STEM IN GENERAL AND ALTERNATELY

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.308
HIGH PAID JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS.

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.244
SO FOR US THIS ONE MILLION IT'S

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.312
CURRENTLY BEEN A ONE TIME GRANT

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.781
T. MAKING IT ONGOING THAT'S

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.683
GOING TO CREATE BIG- COST

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.685
SAVINGS FOR STUDENTS EVENTUALLY

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:51.490
SO FOR THE EDUCATION SIDE THIS.

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.258
IS A BIG EXCITING PROPOSAL. YOUR

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.525
EXPECTING THE WE THE COMMITTEE

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:54.893
SHOULD NOT RE EVALUATE THAT

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.399
EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IT SHE LIKE

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:03.002
THAT ME VERY IRRESPONSIBLE WHAT.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:05.437
ON IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AS

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:07.039
THE GOVERNING OF DOES PUT OUT

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.874
ANNUAL REPORTS IN TERMS OF ITS

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:11.810
ACTIVITIES AND- PROVIDES DETAILS

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.612
ON ITS ITS GRAND SIX CENTER AND

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.748
THIS WOULD WOULD BE BAKED INTO

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:17.583
THEIR- YOU KNOW THEY PROVIDE

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:22.054
UPDATES. BUT THE POINT I MAKE IS

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:23.789
. THAT'S NOT OVERSIGHT ANNUAL

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:27.393
REPORTS. FOR ME OR JUST KIND OF

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:29.595
NONSENSE. IT'S COVERING THE BASE

00:15:29.662 --> 00:15:30.362
PRETENDING THAT YOU'RE REALLY

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.231
DOING SOMETHING WHAT ARE THE

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.500
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THAT

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:35.868
YOU'RE GOING TO IMPOSE HERE. THE

00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:40.472
CRITERIA. TO JUSTIFY YOUR

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.775
ACTIONS THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:45.277
WE PROPOSE TO DO THIS TWO

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:48.013
MILLION RESTORATION OF TWENTY

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.748
TWENTY CUTS IN THE ONE MILLION

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:52.918
AUGMENTATION FOR THECHEMISTRY

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.920
FOCUSED OUR UNDERGRADUATE

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:57.556
INNOVATIVE PLATFORM THAT DAD WE

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.892
DON'T HAVE IN BBL WE DON'T HAVE

00:15:59.958 --> 00:16:02.394
DETAILED PERFORMANCE METRICS THE

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:04.396
JUSTIFICATION THERE IS THAT IT'S

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:06.665
ESSENTIALLY A PILOT PROGRAM THAT

00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.234
WE'RE PROPOSING TO SCALE. AND SO

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.637
THEY ARE IN THE IT PART OF THE

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:14.073
PROPOSAL IS THAT IN THE FIRST

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.575
YEAR OF PERMANENT FUNDING THEY

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:17.309
WOULD BUILD OUT A MULTI YEAR

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:20.079
PLAN- SO WE'RE THEY'RE SORT OF

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:21.580
PUTTING TOGETHER FROM PILOT TO

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.049
SCALING PHASE AND THINKING

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:26.952
THROUGH WHAT METRICS MIGHT EVEN-

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.188
HE ACHIEVABLE. THANK YOU SIR I

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:31.423

QUICKLY WANT TO ECHO SOME OF

00:16:39.531 --> 00:16:41.567
THE- THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS FROM

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.902
MY COLLEAGUES. SINCE WE DON'T

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:46.972
EVEN NOW IF THIS IS GONNA WORK-

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:49.842
THE QUESTION IS A Y. HERE

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.510
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:53.145
ANY. IS NOT DRIVEN BY ANY KIND

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.179
OF STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES SO

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.948
THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION WHY NO

00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:58.283
PR AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.718
IS IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.286
WILL WORK Y. AS SEEMS PRETTY

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:04.256
PRESUMPTION WAS TO. ASK FOR ON

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:08.427
GOING FUNDING. FINANCE. I

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:11.063
APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS IN ALL

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.698
JUST ALL ASSUME WE'RE STILL AND

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:15.401
NOT MY APOLOGIES IF THIS IS NOT

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:17.469
CORRECT BUT I'M ASSUMING WE'RE

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.271
GOING TO STILL TALK ABOUT THE-

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:20.706
THREE MILLION ONGOING PROPOSED

00:17:20.773 --> 00:17:21.473
FOR THE LEARNING LAB

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.411
SPECIFICALLY. AND SO FOR THE AT

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:29.181
TWO MILLION RESTORATION. OUR OWN

00:17:29.248 --> 00:17:30.082
IT WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:32.718
IT. THE CELL LEARNING LAB WAS

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.486
CREATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THE

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:36.588
TRAILER BILL TO THE BUDGET ACT

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.590
AB EIGHTEEN OH NINE. AND THE

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:40.058
ORIGINAL GRANT POOL THAT THEY

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:41.994
HAD TO PROVIDE INTERSECTING

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:46.098
FACULTY GROUPS- AGGRESSIVE-

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:49.268
INNOVATIVE LIKE STEM FOCUSED.

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.437
SHIFTS IN TEACHING AND EDUCATING

00:17:51.503 --> 00:17:53.272
UNDERGRADUATES THAT GRANT POOL

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:55.207
WAS AT TEN MILLION THEY WERE

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:57.042
LATER CUT DOWN TO EIGHT MILLION

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:58.310
SO WE'RE SENSUALLY TRYING TO

00:17:58.377 --> 00:18:00.179
PROPOSE LET'S GO BACK TO HOW THE

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.081
PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY THAT'S

00:18:03.148 --> 00:18:04.082
THE BIGGEST PIECE OF THIS

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:05.651
PROPOSAL THE SECOND PIECE WHICH

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.719
I IT SOUNDS LIKE SENATORS ARE

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.955
CONCERNED WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.458
THE AUGMENTATION TO TAKE ONE OF

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:14.460
THE CURRENT GRANTEES MAKE IT ON

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:17.663
GOING- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:19.565
CONCERNS YOU'RE YOU'RE VOICING.

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:20.499
BUT IN OUR VIEW THIS IS AN

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.334
EXCITING OPPORTUNITY

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:23.168
SPECIFICALLY IN THE HIGHER ED

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.370
WORLD FOR US THINGS THAT

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.805
OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.507
TYPE OF INTERSEGMENT ALL

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:30.909
COLLABORATION HAPPENING WITHOUT

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:33.679
THIS PROGRAM. I SEE MISS LARK

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:37.049
PARK HAS HER HAND UP. I THANK

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:38.116
YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:41.520
ADD ON- THE ONE MILLION-

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:42.855
AUGMENTATION ONGOING

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:43.822
AUGMENTATION THAT'S BEING

00:18:43.889 --> 00:18:45.691
REQUESTED FOR ONE OF OUR OUR

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.593
GRANT PROJECTS THERE ARE REALLY

00:18:47.659 --> 00:18:49.361
THREE DIMENSIONS OF VALUE THAT

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:51.330
THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT HAS THAT

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:53.365
ARE UNIQUE ONE IS ABOUT COST TO

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:54.833
STUDENTS ABOUT TAX THE COST TO

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.202
STUDENTS- VERY VERY MANY

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.403
STUDENTS TAKE GENERAL CHEMISTRY

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.872
IN THESTATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:02.107
SO HAVING SOMETHING OF THAT IS

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:04.877
FREE FOR THEM THAT COULD BE

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.478
UNIFORMLY USE ACTUALLY HAS A

00:19:06.545 --> 00:19:09.047
MULTIPLE AND- RATIO VALUE IN

00:19:09.114 --> 00:19:10.816
TERMS OF THE STATE'S INVESTMENT

00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:13.519
A SECOND DIMENSION OF VALUE IS-

00:19:13.585 --> 00:19:17.256
THAT ADHD. FIVE IS- IT CORPORATE

00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:18.790
CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE CULTURALLY

00:19:18.857 --> 00:19:21.293
SUSTAINING MATERIALS WITHIN THE

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.228
COURSE AND ONE OF THINGS THAT

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:25.397
MANY OF OUR GRANTEES- ARE

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.633
WORKING ON IT IS STUDENTS SENSE

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:28.834
OF BELONGING ESPECIALLY FOR

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:32.170
UNDER RECORDS SENATE STUDENTS.

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:35.841
AND BAGS- HAVING STUDENTS-

00:19:35.908 --> 00:19:39.578
MAINTAIN THEIR PATHWAY TO SPAM-

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:40.979
WHEN THEY ARE AT RISK RIGHT

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.214
UNDER UNDER REPRESENTATIVE OR

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:43.015
FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN THE

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:45.183
MINORITY- IS SOMETHING THAT WE

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.785
THINK CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A GREAT

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.388
VALUE IN KEEPING STUDENTS ON A

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.123
STEM PATHWAY THAT WILL THEN NEED

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.258
TO THE STEM JOBS THE THIRD IS-

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:57.296
TECHNOLOGY VALUE WHICH IS REALLY-MAKING USE OF. NEW TECHNOLOGIES

00:19:57.362 --> 00:20:04.002
ADAPTIVE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES.

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:05.237
TO AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:06.572
THIS IS CUTTING EDGE AND HOW A

00:20:06.638 --> 00:20:07.906
LOT OF LEARNING TO BE DONE IN

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.474
THE FUTURE AND SAID THIS PROJECT

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.742
ACTUALLY REPRESENTS A

00:20:10.809 --> 00:20:12.811
COMBINATION OF UNIQUE VALUES I

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:15.547
THAT I AT THAT ARE AT THE

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:17.115
CUTTING EDGE. OF EDUCATION.

00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:18.450
RIGHT THE DOUBLES ALWAYS IN THE

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:25.524
DETAILS SO. CENTER NIELSEN. LET

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:26.525
ME TRYTHAT THIS DEBATE AGAIN

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:30.729
AND- RESPECTFULLY I HAVE GOT TO

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.632
RESPOND USE THE WORD FREE. I

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:35.867
KIND OF TAKE OFFENSE AT THIS

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:38.437
FREE. BUT BUT HERE'S THE POINT

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:41.540
GETTING BACK TO YOUR A WARNING

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.575
ANY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS STRICT

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.611
STANDARDS- LET THINGS JUST WORK

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:47.746
OUT WE'LL SEE. IF THERE'S

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:49.147
ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN VERY

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:51.016
EVIDENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:53.051
THAT WE JUST STATE THE HIGH TECH

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:55.887
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD CANNOT GET

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:57.856
IT RIGHT. THE BILLIONS OF

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.792
DOLLARS IN. TAXES AFTER

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:02.594
TECHNOLOGICAL UPGRADES IN OUR-

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:04.930
VARIOUS AGENCIES YOU NAME THE

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:07.532
AGENCY. FISCAL MILLION THE MOST

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:10.068
RECENT. THESE PROJECTS DO NOT

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:13.639
COME IN ON BUDGET. THE ALWAYS

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.874
GET EXPANDED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.343
WAY CONTRACTS GET AMENDED. IT'S

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.014
AN EMBARRASSMENT. THE STATE

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.217
SENATE ITSELF THE COMMUNICATIONS

00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:28.620
CONTINUE TO BREAK DOWN. THE NEW

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:29.621
BUILDING THAT WE ARE NOW

00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:31.923
OCCUPIED. I DON'T WANT TO SAY

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.525
IT'S A DISASTER BUT LET'S JUST

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:35.394
SAY IT'S NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL AT

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.230
THIS POINT. AND WE'RE SPENDING A

00:21:38.296 --> 00:21:40.499
LOT OF MONEY AT IT. GETS BACK TO

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:42.334
MY POINT THAT I WANT TO SEE

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:45.103
DELIVERABLES. WANT TO SEE

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.373
CONSEQUENCES IF THE PROVIDER.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.977
THE CONTRACTOR DOES NOT. DELIVER

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.979
AND THAT THAT BE WRITTEN INTO

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.014
OUR CONTRACTS. WE'VE GOT TO

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.116
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET IT RIGHT

00:21:58.183 --> 00:21:59.551
. IN THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION

00:21:59.618 --> 00:22:01.787
TECHNOLOGY AND I DO NOT KNOW IF

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:03.355
THAT'S THE CURRENT. NAME OF THAT

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:06.291
AGENCY. IT'S SINGULAR

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.660
ACHIEVEMENT OVER THE DECADES IS

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:09.728
JUST BEEN TO KEEP CHANGING ITS

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:12.330
NAME. BUT HASN'T MADE ANYTHING

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:14.900
BETTER NOW SHOULD WE IMPOSE SOME

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.069
STANDARDS ON THAT AGENCY THAT IS

00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:19.271
SUPPOSED TO THE FACT GREATER

00:22:19.337 --> 00:22:22.140
EFFICIENCY. AND DELIVERY OF

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:25.110
THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.679
PROJECT ABSOLUTELY. SO I JUST

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:29.481

ONE HOW WAS THE CARNEGIE

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:45.297
SCIENCE- HUB IDENTIFIED. AND I

00:22:45.363 --> 00:22:47.432
GUESS THIS IS THE FOR FINANCE OR

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:51.803
OPR- BRIAN COULD RESPOND TO THAT

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE

00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:00.812
CARNEGIE SCIENCE. THEY'RE

00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:02.380
THEY'RE LOOKING TO CONSOLIDATE

00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:04.516
OPERATIONS FOCUSED ON

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:06.518
ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE. IN

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:09.354
PASADENA AND DAVE THEY'VE

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:10.889
ESTIMATED A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.791
MILLION AS THE TOTAL COST FOR A

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.726
NEW FACILITY THAT WOULD HOUSE

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.428
THIS THIS CONSOLIDATION OF

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:17.729
EXISTING STAFF AND EXPANDING

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.932
STAFF. HI WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:23.735
LOCATING THAT IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:24.836
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IS

00:23:24.903 --> 00:23:26.705
ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVE PRIVATE

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:29.808
FUNDS A CAMPAIGN GOING ON NOW

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:30.308
CAPITAL CAMPAIGN FOR THE

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:33.912
FACILITY- THAT THE STATE. COULD

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:37.449
COULD I WOULD COULD MAKE A

00:23:37.516 --> 00:23:37.983
CRITICAL CONTRIBUTION WITH

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:40.819
TWENTY MILLION- OUR OUR VIEW IS

00:23:40.886 --> 00:23:42.721
THAT WE'RE WE'RE NOT AWARE OF

00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:44.055
THE EXACT AMOUNT OF PRIVATE

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.390
FUNDING THEY HAVE AT THIS POINT

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:46.558
WE KNOW THAT ARE TWENTY MILLION

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.726
WOULD NOT SUPPLANT IN THE

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.995
EXISTING FARMS SO THAT THIS

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:51.062
WOULD ACTUALLY BE CRITICAL TO

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:54.366
THEM. PULLING THIS OFF SO WE ARE

00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:56.401
. WE VIEW THIS AS A GREAT STEP

00:23:56.468 --> 00:23:58.136
FORWARD IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE

00:23:58.203 --> 00:23:59.905
MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION.

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:02.908
AGENDA FOR THE STATE. ALSO JUST

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:03.975
ADDED I MEAN IT'S IMPORTANT

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.443
CONTEXT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.779
HAS A BIG. CLIMATE PACKAGE THIS

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:10.849
BUDGET THERE'S BILLIONS ACROSS.

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:12.551
EVERY AREA FROM HOUSING

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:14.352
TRANSPORTATION HIGHER EDUCATION

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:16.755
ETCETERA- AND SO THIS TWENTY

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:19.191
MILLION IS JUST. IN OUR VIEW

00:24:19.257 --> 00:24:20.091
JUST SORT OF A SMALL PIECE OF

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:22.027
THE- LET'S LET'S ADVANCE

00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:25.630
RESEARCH LABS- TRANSITION JOBS

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:27.532
ETCETERA SO THIS IS LIKE A BIG.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:29.234
PART OF A BIGGER VISION. I

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:31.036
APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE

00:24:31.102 --> 00:24:32.871
HUNDREDS I'M SURE OF OTHER

00:24:32.938 --> 00:24:34.573
CORPORATIONS AND NONPROFIT

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:36.608
ORGANIZATIONS DOING WORK IN THE

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:37.909
CLIMATE SPACE SO THE QUESTION IS

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.812
REALLY COULD BE- SELECTION OF

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:42.647
THE CARNEGIE SCIENCE HUB STAND

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:44.282
UP TO SCRUTINY IF FOLKS WANTED

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:47.118
TO KNOW. WHY THEY WERE SELECTED

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:49.454
OVER SOMEONE ELSE. SO THEN THE

00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:51.089
LAST THE SECOND QUESTION IS

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:53.358
THEIR CRITERIA FOR THE GOLDEN

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:54.759
STATE AWARDS GRANT PROGRAM

00:24:54.826 --> 00:24:57.128
BECAUSE SIMILAR TO THE COMMENTS

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:58.997
OF SENATOR CABALLERO EVERYONE

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.732
LOVES INNOVATION GRANTS. AND

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:03.001
COMPETITIVE GRANTS BUT YOU ALSO

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:03.969
HAVE TO HAVE CRITERIA AND

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:07.272
GUARDRAILS AND SOME TRANSPARENCY

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:08.340
AROUND HOW THOSE ARE GOING TO

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:10.041
BE- WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:11.576
WILL BE. SORT OF-

00:25:11.643 --> 00:25:13.511
OPERATIONALIZED SO I KNOW THIS

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.347
IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM YOU MIGHT

00:25:15.413 --> 00:25:17.215
NOT HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT-

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:20.118
YOU'LL HAVE TO GET ON. WE

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.453
APPRECIATE THAT I CAN JUST OFFER

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:23.488
OUR OUR OUR PROPOSAL AS IT

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:25.490
STANDS IN BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE.

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:28.326
THE THERE'S TWO WAYS THAT THE-

00:25:28.393 --> 00:25:29.961
THE THIRTY MILLION ONE TIME

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:32.697
GENERAL FUND. WORDS WOULD

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:35.300
ESSENTIALLY BEEF. END UP IN

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.769
GRANTEES HANDS THE FIRST FILTER

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.271
WOULD BE WE HAVE SOME

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:41.606
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA- WE CALL

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:44.709
OUT IN BBL THAT- POTENTIAL

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:48.313
ELIGIBLE- INDIVIDUALS OR TEAMS

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.115
FOR NOMINATIONS WOULD INCLUDE

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:51.716
INSTRUCTORS AT PUBLIC

00:25:51.783 --> 00:25:55.987
UNIVERSITIES- RESEARCHERS. THAT

00:25:56.054 --> 00:25:58.023
THEY WORK ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.658
OTHER BIG FILTER IS THAT THE

00:25:59.724 --> 00:26:01.326
SELECTION COMMITTEE B. B. L.

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:03.194
SPECIFIES THERE'D BE TWELVE

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.529
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:06.598
SELECTION COMMITTEE THEY WOULD

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:09.467
COME FROM A BROAD RANGE OF.

00:26:09.534 --> 00:26:11.636
RAFEAL SAID IN A STAPLER GROUP

00:26:11.703 --> 00:26:13.738
SO WE HAVE A BUNCH OF EXPERTISE

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:16.641
THERE- IT DELEO HAS CRITICIZED

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.209
THIS AS TOO BROAD IN OUR VIEW

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:19.778
THAT'S THE STRENGTH WE THINK

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:21.246
THAT HAVING A SELECTION

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:22.113
COMMITTEE FROM MULTIPLE

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.182
PERSPECTIVES. IS GONNA BE HOW

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:26.618
THIS THIS OFFERS- THE WAY OF

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:29.220
IDENTIFYING STATEWIDE CONCERNS

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:31.990
THAT THAT NEED RECOGNITION FOR

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:32.891
PLACES WHERE INNOVATION IS

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:35.593
HAPPENING- SO- THAT'S THAT'S

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.228
PROBABLY NOT SATISFACTORY IN

00:26:37.295 --> 00:26:39.297
TERMS OF THE THEIR WINTER RACING

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.298
BUT I THINK THAT'S OUR

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:41.533
PERSPECTIVE. WELL YOU KNOW WE

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.368
ALWAYS HAVE TO HAVE A STARTING

00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.270
POINT SO- WE'RE NEXUS SINCE I

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:46.905
DON'T SEE ANY OTHER FOLKS

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:47.872
INTERESTED IN COMMENTING WE'RE

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.007
GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:50.208
DISCUSSION ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:52.410

DEPRESSION RESEARCH COMPOSITION

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:35.440
RESEARCH PROPOSAL BECAUSE- WE

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:36.741
GENERALLY FIND IT CHALLENGING TO

00:29:36.808 --> 00:29:37.909
EVALUATE THESE PRECISION

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:38.977
MEDICINE PROPOSALS GIVEN THE

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.678
LACK OF A STATE WIDE FRAMEWORK

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:41.312
FOR PRIORITIZING THE ALLOCATION

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:43.114
OF STATE FUNDING. FOR SPECIFIC

FUNDING FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH-

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:52.357
THAT'S IN AND WE HAVE SOME

00:29:52.423 --> 00:29:53.925
LONGSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:55.827
PRECISION MEDICINE RESEARCH.

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.395
AREA THAT THAT THAT WE PROVIDED

00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:58.963
IN THE PAST SO I'M A BELIEVER

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.100
THAT POINT. I WILL- MENTION IN

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.035
THE AGENDA THAT. IS MENTIONED IN

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:05.770
THE AGENDA THE INSTITUTE EVENTS

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:07.438
PRECISION MEDICINE IS JUSTIFIED

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:09.741
CONTINUED- STATE FUNDING FOR

SELECTED AREAS OF PRECISION

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:13.011
MEDICINE TO HELP PLUG GAPS IN

00:30:13.077 --> 00:30:15.380
THE FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH.

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.882
THAT IT RECEIVES BUT- ON THE

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:19.117
ADMINISTRATION'S NOT SUPPORTED

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.585
THIS WITH A DETAILED GAP

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:23.154
ANALYSIS HELP US UNDERSTAND THE

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:25.356
NEED FOR FUNDING CERTAIN. AREAS

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:27.559
OF RESEARCH OVER OTHERS WE DO

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:28.927
HOWEVER FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:29.627
TO INCREASE THE FIRST

00:30:29.694 --> 00:30:31.229
PARTICIPATION AND BIOMEDICAL

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:32.564
RESEARCH PROJECTS COULD HAVE

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.365
MERIT. SOME GROUPS HAVE BEEN

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.600
HISTORICALLY TO REPRESENTED IN

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:36.834
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH IN THIS IS

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:38.469
LIKE TO DOCUMENT AND HEALTH

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:39.537
DISPARITIES. WELL THIS EFFORT

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:41.039
COULD POSSIBLY DUPLICATE OTHER

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:42.807
FEDERALLY LED EFFORTS TO

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:43.841
INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN THE

00:30:43.908 --> 00:30:45.310
STUDIES NATIONALLY. THIS

00:30:45.376 --> 00:30:47.011
PROPOSAL- APPEARS THAT IT WOULD

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:48.313
BE FOR FOCUSED ON INCREASING

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:50.348
PARTICIPATION AMONG THE DIVERSE

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:51.115
COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE STATE

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:54.586
SPECIFICALLY AND SO THERE MAY BE

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:55.787
SOME BENEFIT TO HAVING AFFECTS.

00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.590

00:31:51.342 --> 00:31:52.477
PROJECTS THAT REALLY THE FOCUS

00:31:52.543 --> 00:31:54.145
ON DEPRESSION AND I DON'T I

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:55.380
THINK THERE CANNOT BE A BETTER

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:58.683
TIME. FOR US TO FOCUS ON

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.886
DEPRESSION- AND I'M- WE DON'T

00:32:01.953 --> 00:32:03.721
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. SO WE'RE

00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.757
GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. HOW WE

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:10.628
HELP PEOPLE- AND SO THE IDEA OF

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:13.364
DOING IT IT AND BROADER. IN IN

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:16.067
TERMS OF- TREATMENTS THE TREATY

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.436
GROUP AS OPPOSED TO INDIVIDUALS

00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:20.872
REALLY APPEALS TO ME AND SO I

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:22.840
JUST I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:26.344
A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW- HOW

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:28.146
WE USE PRECISION MEDICINE IN

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:32.583
THIS PARTICULAR. INSTANCE GIVEN

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.519
THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT LOOKS

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:35.720
AT GENETICS ENVIRONMENT AND

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.955
LIFESTYLE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:40.892
TREATMENT SHOULD BE AND- I'M NOT

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:42.293
. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE WHAT

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.995
THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:45.730
FOR AND EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.865
GONNA GET AFTER WE SPENT TEN

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:52.704
MILLION DOLLARS. ARE ON ON A- ON

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:55.406
A ON A PROJECT THAT THEY DON'T

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.141
DETER ST A FIVE. THREE TO FIVE

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.811
PROJECTS AND WHERE THOSE

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:01.479
PROJECTS ARE LOCATED BECOMES

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:03.214
REALLY IMPORTANT YES TWO YOU

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:05.116
KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE GROUPS OF

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:06.184
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BEING

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.885
STUDIED SO I GUESS I JUST NEED

00:33:07.952 --> 00:33:09.320
MORE INFORMATION ANDERSON

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:11.389
EXACTLY HOW THIS. THIS

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:15.660
PARTICULAR GRANT WOULD WORK. SO

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:17.195
IS THE DETAIL IS IMPORTANT

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:19.831
DETAILS ARE IMPORTANT MARIA-

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:23.634
MAIL SENT. IF ON THAT AND THIS

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:27.171
IS GOING TO BE IN ONGOING THING

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.973
. IT SEEMS LIKE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.444
PRO. GET AN IDEA THE SOMETHING

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:36.614
SOUNDS CONTEMPORARY INTERESTING

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.750
TO THEM IMPORTANT OR AN AGENCY

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:40.718
TO BUILD THIS BUREAUCRACY OR ITS

00:33:40.785 --> 00:33:44.555
BUDGET. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:48.292
POPS UP IN MANY AGENCY BUDGETS.

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:52.296
THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT. AND IT'S

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:53.364
PRETTY TOUGH FOR US TO KEEP

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:56.401
TRACK OF IT. OUR SUB COMMITTEE

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:59.404
CAN SCRUTINIZE IT. BUT THEN IT'S

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.507
KINDA LOST IN THE SHUFFLE. AND

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:05.376
THEN I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:07.712
LEDGE ANALYST BECAUSE I THINK

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:08.780
THEY WOULD DO THAT WITH THE

00:34:08.846 --> 00:34:10.014
FURNACE THAT. OTHER ENTITIES

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:13.818
WOULD NOT. WHAT'S GOING ON IN

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.020
THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN THESE

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:20.558
AREAS. RESEARCH AND APPLICATION

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:23.861
THE PRECISION MEDICINE. WHY DOES

00:34:23.928 --> 00:34:26.164
IT ALL HAVE TO BE COME VESTED IN

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.000
GOVERNMENT OR SO MUCH OF IT SO

00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:32.036
MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOW

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:34.572
THIS IS. BUDGET DUST MILLIONS OF

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:38.242
DOLLARS. LADIES AND GENTLEMAN

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:41.479
OUR BUDGETS PLURAL. DEPARTMENT

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:44.182
BUDGETS ARE FULL. OF THESE GOOD

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:49.153
IDEAS. SO I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.254
GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT MORE

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.722
SCRUTINY. AND A LOT MORE

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:54.826
PRESCRIPTION PRESCRIPTION ON HOW

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.694
MONIES ARE TO BE EXPENDED.

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:59.797
BEFORE THE EGISLATURE SHOULD

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:04.168
VOTE YES FOR MORE MONEY. SENATOR

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:07.138
NIELSEN I MEAN SENATOR ROB.

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:09.273
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I GUESS I

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.908
WILL MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS YOU

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:13.277
KNOW I WAS AROUND THE- I BELIEVE

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:16.347
THAT THE INCEPTION- OF THIS

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:19.484
PRECISION MEDICINE- JOURNEY IN

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.819
THIS COMMITTEE AND I WAS. THOSE

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:23.221
WHO WERE THERE AND- PEER AT THE

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:26.123
TIME THEY RECALL- THAT I WAS

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.859
SOMEWHAT CRITICAL OF THE

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.828
PROPOSALS THEN. AS TO THE NATURE

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:33.397
OF THE RESEARCH- PRECISION

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:35.032
MEDICINE RESEARCH IN THE

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:37.935
POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT. IT COULD

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:40.071
OR WAS PROPOSED TO HAVE GIVEN OF

00:35:40.137 --> 00:35:41.906
COURSE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. BY

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:43.875
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH

00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:47.712
THE- THE N. I. H. HOWEVER-

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.146
THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF TIME I

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.749
NOW RECOGNIZE THAT THE IN FACT

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:54.285
GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE. IN THIS

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.654
TYPE OF INNOVATIVE ENERGY

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:59.323
RESEARCH. AND THAT AS A STATE AS

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.659
LARGE AS WE ARE IN THIS STATE OF

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:03.895
CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T COUNT ON THE

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.963
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO DO THE

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.432
SPECIFIC TYPE OF HEALTH RELATED

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:11.302
RESEARCH THAT WE REALLY NEED IS

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.870
A STATE. TO DO ARE HEALTH

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.372
RELATED- PLANNING AND

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:17.642
PROGRAMMING. AND AS TO METRIC

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.043
SIDE YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF THE

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.912
MILITARY AND- THOSE OF YOU

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:24.348
WHO'VE BEEN AROUND THE BUDGET.

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:25.249
FOR THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.217
AND YOU'VE BEEN IN COMMITTEES

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:27.618
THAT I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO SIT

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.587
ON YOU'VE HEARD ME. GIVE A

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:31.055
LITTLE LECTURE PERIODICALLY

00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:33.057
ABOUT METRICS AND HELP METRICS

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:36.027
ARE CRITICAL. IN ANYTHING WHERE

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:38.329
WE SPEND MONEY HOWEVER. I ALSO

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.031
THINK KIM BELIEVES THAT WITH

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:42.400
THIS TYPE OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:45.236
IT'S FAIRLY DIFFICULT. TO INSIST

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:47.738
ON THE TYPE OF PERFORMANCE

00:36:47.805 --> 00:36:49.607
METRICS THAT I WOULD NORMALLY.

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.943
OTHERWISE INSIST ON IN THE

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:55.112
BUDGET PROCESS SO- I. I'M A

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:56.847
BELIEVER AND I THINK THERE IS

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.716
VALUE IN THIS RESEARCH IN THE

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:01.552
MONEY THAT WE DIRECT TOWARD IT

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.753
TO I BELIEVE IT IS HAD IMPACT

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.056
SINCE. OF THE TWO THOUSAND

00:37:05.122 --> 00:37:06.090
FOURTEEN BUDGET WHEN I WAS HERE

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:07.959
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND I INTEND

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:10.294
TO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL- IF AND

00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.396
WHEN IT COMES FORWARD FOR A VOTE

QUESTIONS I JUST WANNA- I'M

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:30.915
GOING TO CALL ON- A CHILLY AND

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.350
MCCALL TO ANSWER SOME OF THE-

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.552
BEST JUST A COUPLE OF- YOU KNOW

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:37.355
THE Y. O. PR- SPECIFICALLY FOR

THIS IN ONE OF THE ROLE.

00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:40.625
INSPECTION ROLE OF WILL BE OUR

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:42.593
IS WORK ACROSS THE STATE

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.097
AGENCIES SO WE WORK AND WORK

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:48.466
WITH ACROSS. A BROAD-

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.534
STAKEHOLDERS SO THAT IS PART OF

00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:52.536
THE ROLE OF OPR AND I WASN'T

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:54.405
HERE WHEN. PRECISION MEDICINE

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.674
WAS PUT IN THERE ARE BAD. I DO

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:59.510
SEE THE ROLE AS AN AGENCY THAT

00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:01.646
IS CHARGED WITH. CONNECTING THE

DOTS ON A LOT OF ISSUES- I

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.983
BELIEVE IT MAKES SENSE THAT ON

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:10.321
THE SECOND. PART I THINK- I

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:11.589
BELIEVE COVER HOUSE ROLE IN THE

00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:13.891
SPECIFIC REDUCE ISSUES IN.

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:14.792
RELEVANCE TRUE HEALTH

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:17.461
DISPARITIES IN RESEARCH ON

00:38:17.528 --> 00:38:19.664
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.098
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR RESEARCH

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.601
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RESEARCH IS

00:38:23.668 --> 00:38:25.770
DONE ON PEOPLE OF COLOR AND SOME

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.538
OF THE WORK THAT CYCLONE HAS

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:29.407
DONE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:31.042
SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT UP

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:32.476
BUT I'M GONNA CALL JULIAN

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:35.379

MEASUREMENT FOR ACADEMIC

00:39:02.139 --> 00:39:04.141
RESEARCH IN FACT WE CONDUCT. A

00:39:04.208 --> 00:39:07.111
RIGOROUS EXTERNAL OUT OF STATE-

INNOVATION FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.340
OUR PROJECT- CONTRIBUTED TO THE

FDA'S FIRST EVER APPROVAL OF AN

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.546
IMAGING BIOMARKER- THERE ARE

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:45.816
ALSO RESULT WHY. OUR RESEARCH

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:48.686
CONTRIBUTED TO- THE STATE OF

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:50.755
CALIFORNIA BEING ABLE TO TRACK.

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.023
HOW THE VIRUS MUTATING IN

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.893
CALIFORNIA THE HARD CODED TO

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.295
VIRUS- THAT WAS KIND OF A DREAM

00:39:58.362 --> 00:39:58.829
COME TRUE IMPACT FOR ANY

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.832
RESEARCH. PROGRAMS WILL SUCCEED

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:04.602
AND SEE THE IMPACT- SO. AFTER

00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:05.903
FINDING THAT WOULD ONLY FEW

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.738
YEARS AFTER THAT PROJECT WAS

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:12.409
FUNDED. ON WE ARE AT THE SENATOR

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:41.051
OTHER. COMMUNITY OUTREACH

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.886
CAMPAIGNS IS AROUND THE

00:48:42.953 --> 00:48:44.621
IMPORTANCE OF HAVING TRUSTED

00:48:44.688 --> 00:48:45.922
PARTNERS TO HELP CARRY THE

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:48.325
MESSAGE THE STATE FROM THE STAGE

00:48:48.392 --> 00:48:50.160
TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.461
AND YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:53.063
THE INFORMATION IS CULTURALLY

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.964
APPROPRIATE LINGUISTICALLY

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.400
APPROPRIATE. AND ABLE TO YEAR TO

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.602
COME FROM A MESSENGER WHO IS

00:48:58.669 --> 00:48:59.569
TRUST AND HAS AN EXISTING

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:01.705
RELATIONSHIP IS MUCH MORE

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.573
EFFECTIVE WHEN ESPECIALLY WHEN-

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.976
CONVEYING CRITICAL IN IN

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:07.411
INFORMATION THAT IS ALSO TIME

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:09.613
BOUND. UP THE OTHER THING THE

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.681
OTHER BIG LESSON I THINK THAT WE

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.416
NEED NOTED FROM THESE PROCESS

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:14.718
USES THE COMPLEXITY AND TO BE

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.920
ABLE TO GET ACCESS TO COMMUNITY

00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:18.488
PARTNERS AND GOING THROUGH THE

00:49:18.555 --> 00:49:19.923
PROCESS OF STANDING UP AS

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.093
STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO. VIAD

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.828
RESOURCE INTO COMMUNITY BASED

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:27.731
ORGANIZATIONS IS COMPLEX. AND IT

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.566
IS IT IS CHALLENGING AS TIME

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:30.701
CONSUMING. AND SO BEING ABLE TO

00:49:30.767 --> 00:49:33.437
HAVE A STRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:34.504
AWARD- EITHER GRANTS OR

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:36.340
CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:49:36.406 --> 00:49:38.375
THESE RESOURCES. IS A PROCESS

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:40.210
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TO

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:41.311
FIND WAYS TO MAKE THAT MORE

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:43.280
EFFICIENT. AND THEN- I THINK THE

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.015
OTHER THING TOO IS THAT THERE WE

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:46.883
NEED TO LEARN THAT THE VIEW THE

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.920
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE CBO'S. AS

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:52.089
IT RELATES TO BEING ABLE TO-

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.790
HAVE ONGOING STAFFING TO BE ABLE

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:56.326
TO- PUT IN PLACE IS THE SYSTEMS

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:57.494
THE STRUCTURES THE ONGOING

00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:59.029
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.097
THE ADEQUATE SUPPORT AND

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:00.997
INFORMATION TO THEIR

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:02.566
COMMUNITIES. IS AN IMPORTANT

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:04.067
PART OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE SURE

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:05.869
THAT THAT MESSAGING IS RECEIVED

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:08.438

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.754
CENSUS CLOSE TO FIFTY MILLION

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.489
DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING AND I'M

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.825
LEARNED THERE ABOUT WHAT. WHAT

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.694

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.696

I JUST WANTED IT GENERALLY AND

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:41.138
THAT. FOR A WEST WE LOOK AT THIS

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:44.508
PARTICULAR- ISSUE ITEM FOR THE

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:49.679
FUTURE- I HAD. HE AND NUMBER OF

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.314
THE MAYORS A VERY SMALL

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:54.484
COMMUNITIES. PREPARE A LESSONS

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:57.020
LEARNED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:59.489
PART OF THE CODE ROLLOUT OR THE

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:02.192
DISCUSSION WAS ALL DONE FROM THE

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.193
COUNTY LEVEL WITH THE PUBLIC

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.762
HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND I'M I'M

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.664
WONDERING IF MAYBE GETTING THAT

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.800
LIST WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO THE

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:14.204
ANALYSIS AS WELL JUST BECAUSE-

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.540
IN TURN IN TERMS OF TRUSTED ME

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:18.508
MESSAGE MESSENGER'S MAYORS ARE

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.277
GENERALLY WELL LIKED BY THEIR

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:22.112
COMMUNITY THAT'S WHY THEY EEP.

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.947
BECOMING MAYORS AND IT IT MAY

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.015
MAKE MAKE MAY MAKE SENSE TO HAVE

00:51:25.081 --> 00:51:27.050
THEIR LIST IN ADDITION SO THAT

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.852
WORK. WE'RE PUTTING IT TOGETHER

00:51:28.919 --> 00:51:31.555
WITH THEM WITH WHAT YOU'VE

00:51:31.621 --> 00:51:34.090
LEARNED. AS WELL. THAT THAT'S

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:35.158
KIND OF THE REASON FOR MY

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:40.530
QUESTION IS- I BELIEVE AND I MAY

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.165
BE TOTALLY WRONG THAT SOME OF

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:44.401
THE MESSAGING THAT WE DID-

00:51:44.468 --> 00:51:46.069
THROUGH THE MEDIA DIDN'T GET TO

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.771
WHERE IT NEEDED TO GO AND SO HOW

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:50.106
DO WE DO A BETTER JOB NEXT TIME

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:50.974
WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THE

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:53.743
CENSUS AND- AND SOME OF THE

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:58.648
UPTAKE WAS PRETTY SLOW- SO. WHAT

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.717
DID WE LEARN FROM THAT I GUESS

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:05.188
IS MY QUESTION. SO I AM THANK

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:06.823
YOU I DON'T EXPECT MORE MORE

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.058
DISCUSSION ON THIS WE HAVE A LOT

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:10.327
MORE ITEMS BUT I WANTED I DID

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:13.029
WANT TO. BRING UP THE ISSUE-

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:15.665
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE WERE

00:52:15.732 --> 00:52:17.334
. WELL THESE ARE REALLY

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.435
IMPORTANT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:21.638
ON. A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAILED

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:25.609
IN TERMS OF- HOW WE HOW WE DO IT

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.043
THINGS DIFFERENTLY. IF WE HAVE A

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.345
NATURAL DISASTER HOW DO WE

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:30.046
COMMUNICATE WITH. WITH THAT THE

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:32.349
COMPLEX. RESIDENTS THAT WE HAVE

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:37.654
IN THE STATE. LIMAY IF I MAY

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:40.190
FOLLOW UP ON ON THAT YOU KNOW

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:43.093
ART OR WITNESSES SPOKEN ABOUT WE

00:52:43.159 --> 00:52:45.395
SHOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND

00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:46.596
THERE SHOULD BE STRUCTURES. WELL

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:49.132
WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM WHERE

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:51.668
DO WE LEARN WHERE AND HOW WE

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:54.037
SHOULD BECOME MORE EFFICIENT AND

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:56.740
THAT'S WHY THE SPECIFICITY OF

00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:57.674
CENTER COPIERS QUESTION IS

00:52:57.741 --> 00:53:00.043
IMPORTANT. WHAT DID WE LEARN

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:03.813
FROM WHAT THE CENSUS WHAT OTHER

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.650
SOURCES HAVE WE LEARNED FROM.

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:07.684
WE'RE NOT GETTING THE ANSWERS TO

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:10.053
THAT. AND THEN WE'RE BEING ASKED

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.821
TO INVEST MORE SUBSTANTIAL

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:15.025
RESOURCES. IN THE FUTURE AND A

00:53:15.091 --> 00:53:16.960
YEAR FROM NOW WILL BE HERE IN

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:19.062
THE SAME DIALOGUE. THE SAME

00:53:19.129 --> 00:53:21.731
ANSWERS THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT

00:53:21.798 --> 00:53:24.000
WE'RE ASKING HERE TODAY. WE WILL

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.136
NOT HAVE ANYMORE MEASURABLES

00:53:26.202 --> 00:53:30.740
ANYMORE EVIDENCE. OF THE NEAT.

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.342
LET ME FOCUS ON ONE SPECIFIC

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:36.680
POINT. AND ASK THIS. ALLEGE

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:43.286
ANALYST. THIS TALKS ABOUT THE-

00:53:43.353 --> 00:53:45.221
NEW LAW OFFICE OF COMMUNITY

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:46.856
PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:50.794
COMMUNICATIONS. HOW IS THAT ANY

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.432
DIFFERENT THIS NEW DEPARTMENT

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:58.768
FROM WHAT THEY- AND I APOLOGIZE

00:53:58.835 --> 00:53:59.836
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT THE

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.972
CURRENT NAME OF IT IS THE OFFICE

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:04.474
OF INFORMATION. TECHNOLOGY IS

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:07.477
SUPPOSED TO DO. IT WAS ONE

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:08.812
CALLED ALL RIGHT IT WAS A

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.780
ACRONYM AND THEN IT BECAME BILL

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:13.383
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS NOW

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:16.953
BUT- HOW. IS THAT AGENCY THAT

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.222
DEPARTMENT. WHICH IS A FAIRLY

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:23.560
LARGE DEPARTMENT NOW. CAN THEY

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:27.697
BE DOING THIS KIND OF. SCRUTINY

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:30.800
RESEARCH AND REPORTING ANALYST

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.936
WHY DO WE HAVE TO START A NEW

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:37.641
OFFICE. HI THIS IS BRIAN WHETHER

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:38.341
FORD WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:41.711
ANALYST'S OFFICE AND- I THINK

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:42.879
IT'S A FAIR QUESTION ABOUT

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:46.983
WHERE- IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:50.353
CREATING- SOME SORT OF ENTITY

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.355
THAT WOULD- ADDRESS THE

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:54.758
COMMUNICATIONS- NEEDS THAT. THAT

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:56.726
THAT WHERE WHERE THAT'S LOCATED

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.728
IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT I'M

00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:00.363
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. YOU KNOW

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.331
WITH REGARD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:55:01.398 --> 00:55:01.931
TECHNOLOGY I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:04.134
THAT'S MOST APPROPRIATE- PLACE

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.670
FOR THIS- WE EIGHT. YOU KNOW WE

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.271
WOULD SUGGEST AS AN ALTERNATIVE

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.039
PROP THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.907
AGENCY WHICH- HAS EXPERIENCE

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:12.442
WITH PUBLIC OUTREACH HAVING

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:13.176
OVERSEEN THE TWENTY TWENTY

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:15.912
SENSES. ARE RECOVERED AND- ALSO

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.247
WE NOTE THAT YOU KNOW GO ABOUT

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:18.782
SUCH KIND OF A BROAD MISSION

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:19.783
THAT'S NOT FOCUSED ON ANY

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.551
PARTICULAR PUBLIC POLICY AREA

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:22.585
AND MAYBE NEED MORE NEUTRAL

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.020
ABOUT WHICH TOPICS TO FOCUS ON

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:27.057
THAN OTHER ALTERNATIVES. BUT I

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:30.493

00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.930
YOUR QUESTION CENTER. WELL NO

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:35.765
SONG IT'S CLEAR AS MUD BUT IT

00:55:35.832 --> 00:55:37.967
COVERS THE GROUND. I THINK WE

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:42.238
NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE- SO LET'S

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:45.341
KEEP THAT DIALOGUE GOING. AND I

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:49.279

GENERALLY WE HAVE SOME OTHER

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:12.869
ISSUES FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.637
BESIDES JUST WHERE THE OFFICE

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.606

KNOW- CENTER COUPLE YEAR

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.328
MENTIONED HAD SOME. POSITIVE

00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:39.629
OUTCOMES AND MAYBE SOME LESSONS

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.231
TO BE LEARNT THERE'S ALSO FOR

00:56:41.297 --> 00:56:42.232
EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA EARNED

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:43.633
INCOME TAX CREDIT GOLDEN STATE

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.602
STIMULUS OUT REACH- THAT'S BEING

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:47.103
ADMINISTERED BY THE FRANCHISE

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:47.670
TAX BOARD IN THE COMMUNITY

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:49.606
SERVICES DEPARTMENT. AND

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.207
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH THAT SHOWED

00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:53.710
THAT IT- MIGHT HAVE- GRAYSON

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.411
WARINESS BUT ALSO DIDN'T LEAD TO

00:56:55.478 --> 00:56:57.480
ANY INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.415
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT-

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:01.217
CREDITS BEING CLAIMED. SO THERE

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:03.620
ARE- POTENTIALLY OPPORTUNITIES

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:04.754
THAT COULD BE GAINED BY

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:05.989
DESIGNATING A SINGLE ENTITY TO

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.123
FOCUS ON THE CENTRALISING

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.991
EXPERTISE MAINTAINING

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:09.459
RELATIONSHIPS AND HOPEFULLY

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:11.294
CREATE EFFICIENCIES BUT WE'RE

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:12.428
NOT SURE THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESSES

00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:13.730
THIS NEED. AS IT'S STILL

00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:15.732
CONCEPTUAL DOESN'T PROVIDE THE

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:16.766
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.568
REQUESTS ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:20.904
DETAILS. SO WHAT SHOULD YOU

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.972
AGREE THAT THE CONCEPT HAS MERIT

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:24.374
ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WE

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.943
WANT TO RAISE TO YOU- IS THAT.

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:28.411
WE'RE SKEPTICAL THAT ONGOING

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:29.579
FUNDING AMOUNT REQUEST WOULD BE

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:31.314
NECESSARY RATHER WE WOULD

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:32.448
SUGGEST ONLY PROVIDING

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:33.483
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING ON AN

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.918
ONGOING BASIS AND THEN ONE TIME

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.352
FUNDING FOR OTHER SPECIFIC

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:38.388
INITIATIVES IS NEEDED. AND THAT

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:40.790
WOULD ALLOW THE FUNDING TO- AND

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.392
THE FOCUS TO ADJUST OVER TIME

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:42.992
WITH THE STATE'S NEEDS AND THE

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.994
LAST ON ISSUE THAT I WANTED TO

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:48.164
RAISE- REGARDS THE DESIGNATION

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.033
OR DETERMINATION OF. WHAT THE

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:50.800
STATE'S HIGHEST PRIORITY

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.535
COMMUNICATIONS ARE IN ANY GIVEN

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:54.671
YEAR THE PROPOSAL REPEAL THE

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.272
SAYS IT WOULD FOCUS ON THOSE BUT

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.240
WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD BE

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:58.541
DETERMINED IN MEETING COULD BE

00:57:58.608 --> 00:57:59.709
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:57:59.776 --> 00:58:04.647
HAVE. SOME SAY IN SETTING THOSE

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:06.516
PRIORITIES. THANK YOU. THAT IS

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:07.250
VERY HELPFUL. AND THAT'S WHAT I

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.818
WOULD CALL PUTTING SOME MEAT ON

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:10.620
THE BONE. AND SOME

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:13.189
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND ALLOWING THE

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:16.960
LEGISLATURE BETTER INFORMATION

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.127
TO BASE WHAT WE WOULD DO IN THE

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:19.996
FUTURE- SIR HOW WOULD YOU

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:22.799
COMMENT ON THE- INQUIRY ABOUT

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:26.502
THE DUPLICATION OR THE- ROLE OF

00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:27.670
THE OFFICE OF INFORMATION

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:30.039

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:32.008
HERE COULDN'T THOSE BE RESOLVED

00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:36.312
IN THAT DEPARTMENT- I I'M SORRY

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:38.681
I'M NOT. SURE THAT THAT THE

00:58:38.748 --> 00:58:40.216
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY BE THE

00:58:40.283 --> 00:58:41.184
APPROPRIATE SPACE BECAUSE MY

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:42.452
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DEPARTMENT

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.621
TECHNOLOGIES CONTROL AGENCY FOR

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:46.489
OTHER STATE AGENCIES SO IT MAY

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:48.591
BE APPROPRIATE AND OVERSEEING A

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:50.326
TECHNOLOGY PROJECT RELATED TO

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:51.728
MAINTAINING. NETWORKS ARE

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.696
CONTEXT I'M NOT SURE IT WOULDN'T

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.465
NECESSARILY BE THE MOST

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:55.965
APPROPRIATE LOCATION TO

GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:09.345
RESEARCH PROBABLY BUT GENERALLY

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:12.682
COULD PERFORM THAT FUNCTION. BUT

00:59:12.749 --> 00:59:14.317
I JUST HARPER NO TRUST OR

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:17.253
CONFIDENCE WITHOUT SOME KIND OF

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.789
BENCHMARK SOME MEASURABLE SOME

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.191
SPECIFIC THINGS THAT HAVE GOT TO

00:59:22.258 --> 00:59:23.993
BE DELIVERED. AND WE HAVE NOT

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:27.063
GOTTEN REALLY DIRECT ANSWERS TO

OUR QUESTIONS THEY'VE BEEN SORT

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.733
OF GENERAL. I BELIEVE THE

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.268
OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE LEARNING

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:33.836
THE LESSONS OF THE CENSUS OF

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:35.805
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WHAT HAVE

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:37.674
WE LEARNED AND HOW WOULD THAT IT

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.475
AND THAT'S ONLY ONE PART OF THE

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:40.543
OTHER PART IS HOW THAN THAT

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.879
WOULD APPLY TO WHAT THIS CALL

ANYTHING ELSE ON MY BONUS POINTS

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:55.825
FOR. WE DO- WE DO SUGGEST THAT

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:57.126
THAT THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:59.629
WOULD EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.097
OF THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.566
IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP AT THE BE

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.301
KIDDING LAKE WHILE WE ARE

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:33.053

01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:39.359
NOT SURE WHO THAT COMPENSATING

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:41.227

01:51:48.101 --> 01:51:52.806
AROUND THEIR RETAIL AREAS- AND-

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:55.008
AND LOOK AT IT THAT LOOK. LOOK

01:51:55.075 --> 01:51:56.709
TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US

01:51:56.776 --> 01:51:58.578

TO APPLY FOR THIS KIND OF

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:36.816
COMPENSATION BECAUSE YOU KNOW-

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.151

RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING DID

02:01:55.174 --> 02:01:56.742
INTERRUPT ABILITY BUT- WE'RE

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.511
LOOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING.

02:01:58.577 --> 02:02:01.147
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS

02:02:01.213 --> 02:02:01.981
PROPOSAL AS IT DEVELOPS. SOUNDS

02:02:02.048 --> 02:02:03.049
GOOD NOW I'M GOING TO BRING IT

02:02:03.115 --> 02:02:04.483
BACK TO COMMITTEE. MISTER VICE

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:08.220
CHAIR. WELL I HAVE TO OBSERVE

02:02:08.287 --> 02:02:11.791
THAT THIS. THIS TO ME TO BE A

02:02:11.857 --> 02:02:14.226
EFFORT BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:02:14.293 --> 02:02:15.161
SAY THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING

02:02:15.227 --> 02:02:17.229
ABOUT THE PORTS. WHICH REALLY

02:02:17.296 --> 02:02:19.899
WON'T AMOUNT TO MUCH OF ANYTHING

02:02:19.965 --> 02:02:21.200
. WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE PORCH

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:23.369

STRICTLY THOSE WHERE THE PORCH.

02:02:31.177 --> 02:02:35.948
ARE LOCATED AND HE IT'S ALMOST

02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:36.882
LAUGHABLE TO SAY THE

02:02:36.949 --> 02:02:38.117
ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT

02:02:38.184 --> 02:02:39.485

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:51.397
JUST DOING AN INFANT INVENTORY

02:02:51.464 --> 02:02:54.967
AND- REPORT. DATA I DON'T THINK

02:02:55.034 --> 02:02:56.335
THAT'S GOING TO HELP WITH WHAT'S

02:02:56.402 --> 02:02:57.937
GOING ON ON THE PORCH WHEN THIS

02:02:58.003 --> 02:03:01.741

HAVE TWO COMMENTS ONE IS- I

02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.721
REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND A

02:03:15.788 --> 02:03:17.757
LITTLE BIT BETTER EXACTLY WHAT

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:20.860
WE'RE GOING TO BE FUNDING-

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:22.394
BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE A

02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:28.534
COMPLICATED BUSINESS. AND- YOU

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:31.570
KNOW I JUST SPENT. I JUST SPENT

02:03:31.637 --> 02:03:33.139
THE EIGHT HOURS ON THERE ON THE

02:03:33.205 --> 02:03:35.307
ROAD DRIVING UP FROM LA AND THE

02:03:35.374 --> 02:03:37.443
NUMBER OF TRUCKS ON THE ROAD IS

02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:44.083
SHOCKING- AND REALLY SLOWS DOWN-

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:45.684
THE REST OF THE TRAFFIC AND I'M

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:47.653
WONDERING IS THAT THE BEST WAY

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:49.488
TO MOVE GOODS FROM ONE PART OF

02:03:49.555 --> 02:03:51.991
THE STATE TO THE OTHER. IS TO

02:03:52.057 --> 02:03:54.994
PUT THEM ON TRUCKS AND- AND MOVE

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:58.230
THEM AROUND- NUMBER ONE NUMBER

02:03:58.297 --> 02:04:01.433
TWO IS THAT IS THAT- I'VE ALSO

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:05.871
SEEN THE- CARRIERS THAT ARE

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:07.640

GOODS. PARKED OUTSIDE THE IBM.

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:14.146
THE PORTS AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:16.482
KIDS NEED TO GET TO LAND AND

02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:18.684
THEY NEED TO MOVE AND- IT'S NOT

02:04:18.751 --> 02:04:20.853
CLEAR TO ME THAT OUR PORTAL IS

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.489
GOING TO BE THE SOLUTION TO GET

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:24.657
THAT TO HAPPEN I'M- I'M NOT SURE

02:04:24.723 --> 02:04:27.092
I. I'M I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND

02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:29.562
