THE LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORIZED FUNDING FOR THREE FISCAL YEARS. ONE MILLION AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS BEEN FULLY AWARDED IN EACH CITY ANTICIPATE IT CREATING NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED UNITS. YOU CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE AWARDS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

THE PROGRAMS OF NESTOR BY CALLIE CAFE WILL ASK US SOURCE OF ONGOING FUNDING XPG REVENUES. IN SOMERS GENERAL FUND APPLICATIONS HAVE MATCHED OR SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED AT IT YOU REVENUES RECEIVED BY THE PROGRAM. IT'S NOT A PARTIAL DOES. OF AWARDS TO DATE KELLY CHECK THING DISSIPATES ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TOTAL UNITS OVERWHELMING THESE UNITS WOULD BE LOCATED IN THE BAY AREA. HERE AGAIN THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING ADDITIONAL. OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND OVER TWO FISCAL YEARS. AND THE FINAL PROGRAM AND THAT WILL HIGHLIGHT IN THIS HANDOUT IF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INDISPUTABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM.

WHEN ALSO WILL COME. UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO HELP GEORGE EXPLAINS OUR FUTURE HELPING. IN ORDER TO MEET THAT FEATURE HOUSING NEEDS AT A MINIMUM THE STATE IS STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO PLAN FOR TWO POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES OVER THE ROOF OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. AT LEAST ONE MILLION OF THOSE HOMES MUST MEET THE NEED TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THIS IS MORE THAN DOUBLE PRIOR POLITICS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE- THIS IS NOT A THEORETICAL ACADEMIC TARGET THIS IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED ASK YOU THAT MUST BE PLANNED FOR CALIFORNIA. HOW THE PLACE MUST COME WITH STRATEGIES TO MOVE STRAIGHT. HOUSING AT HOUSING TO HELP. THIS CHANGEABLE NAVIGABLE ESSENTIAL THE BRANDING DRIVING CALVET.

THANK YOU I DO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF MS WITH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS COMMITMENT TO FUNDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE I KNOW- HE PUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR- THE FIRST TIME EVER A MULTI YEAR I'M FUNDING TO SUPPORT HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM. AND IT CONTINUES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION INVESTMENTS IN THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT I KNOW THIS YEAR PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT TWO BILLION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND I ALSO I'VE I APPRECIATE THE TEN YEAR- STATE WHAT HOUSING PLAN THAT THAT WAS RELEASED I KNOW AS PART OF THAT PLAN- AND I THINK. MOST OF US KNOW THIS IT CALLS FOR TWO POINT FIVE MILLION TOTAL HOUSING UNITS TO. TO MEET THE DEMAND- WHICH INCLUDES OVER ONE MILLION LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSING UNITS. I THINK WE ALL KNOW TO END HOMELESSNESS AND ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WE NEED A LONG TERM SPENDING COMMITMENT- TEN YEARS WAS VERY CLEAR ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO ENSURE PROGRESS I KNOW MANY OF US WENT ON A HOUSING TOUR. THIS PAST FALL- WE WERE ALL OVER THE STATE FROM CHICO TOOK CONCORD TO INLAND EMPIRE FRESNO SALINAS IN MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO ON GOING FUNDING STREAM FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND IT'S VERY HARD TO PLAN WE GET ONE TIME. MONIES AND OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES TO- PROVIDE THE MONEY THAT HE HAS IN THE CAPACITY THAT HE HAS- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR BUDGET IS OUR VALUES AND THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE. ONGOING CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ME SAYS THAT THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED- AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANT ACCOUNTABLE ABILITY MEASURES TO GO AFFECTS YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR TAXPAYERS KNOW THAT THEY'RE GETTING A STRONG R. O. Y. ON THEIR INVESTMENT THEY WERE. PROBLEM WAS NOT- I WANTED TO ASK EIGHT CD- IT IF YOU ALL HAVE DONE A TEN YEAR FUNDING STRATEGY TO FINANCE THE ONE MILLION LOW INCOME HOUSING UNITS NEEDED- CALLED FOR IN THE STATEWIDE HOUSING PLAN. THAT'S NOT A PART OF THE STATE WHAT HEALTHY PLAN BUT WE DO HAVE. A CALENDAR OF OUR ARE SCHEDULED INVESTMENTS OR NOTICES MONEY AVAILABLE GIVE THEM ON A WEBSITE LIKE I MENTIONED. SIX POINT FIVE BILLION IS STILL SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED AND AVAILABLE- JUST THIS COMING CALENDAR YEAR. OFF FOLLOWING THE EIGHT BILLION IN PREVIOUS YEARS SO- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE IMPLEMENTERS OF THE PROGRAMS THAT- AFT. THE THERE IS STILL FUNDING FOR THE- IN THIS IN THIS NEW TERM. AND THAT'S OUR FOCUS ON THE COURSE OF THE CRAP DIRE NEEDING REPORTS OUT OF. THANK YOU ALL I AM COMMITTED TO FIGURE OUT ALONG TERM FUND FOR THE HOUSING. I KNOW MANY MY COLLEAGUES ARE NOT SOMETHING I KNOW WILL BE WORKING OUT. A BOTH IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS AND- HOUSING COMMITTEE. THANK YOU REST WICKS. APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE BEING THE CHAIR OF HOUSING AS WELL AS- BEING IN THIS COMMITTEE TO- TRULY IT ALSO ADVOCATE FOR. THE BUDGET BEING A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES- MR OLD SAID I ALSO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS WELL- ARE YOU SEE ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROJECTS BESIDES HOTEL. TELLS BEING USED WITH- HOME HE DOLLARS ROUND AS WELL- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THAT ONE IS I THINK A DISTRESSED ASSETS LAST YEAR THAT WAS A COMMON PURCHASE. BUT EVEN LAST YEAR THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF- ASSEMBLY COMMERCIAL- MODULAR HOUSING. I WILL STILL SEEING THAT PLAY OUT IN OUR FUNDING COMMITMENTS. WITH THE- PEOPLE THERE STILL ARE LOOK HEALTHY GOOD LOOKING PURCHASE. SOME CASES YOU'RE SAYING THE ACQUISITION OF EXISTING MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. OF USING THOSE- THE PHONE THIRTY NEXT TO SIR- THAT THE PERSON'S EXPERIENCE IN BUSINESS HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES HOME OFFICE OVERSEEING A PRETTY GOOD I MEAN I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT LAST BIT. TO SPEAK BACK UP LIKE MAYBE A. MINUTE AFTER. WHAT YOU SAID. WE ARE LOOKING YES WE ARE STILL A QUITE QUITE A FEW ISSUES. OF THE OLD WILL USE THAT WITHIN HOME AGAIN WE AND ROUND OF. OUR HOTEL IN MOST WERE A DISTRESS ASSETS OF COURSE LAST YEAR- TAKE A- TO BE SO THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR. A STATE OF THE- FUNDING BUT EEING. QUITE A BIT OF ADDITIONAL ADAPTIVE REUSE AFTER THIS REPORT FOR PROPERTIES MODULAR HOUSING. AND THE LIKE AND- YOU CAN SEE SOME BREAKDOWNS OF WHAT THAT THAT IS ON OUR DASHBOARD OR DATA DASHBOARD THAT IS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU AND DO YOU SEE. THE GETTING MARKS. AS THE QUALITY OF THE HOTELS AND MOTELS AVAILABLE- ARE NEEDING MORE REHABILITATION AND WHAT IS THE AVERAGE COST. WELL THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO- THE AVERAGE COST IS PROBABLY. YOU KNOW WELL I THINK WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE PER UNIT COST YOU BECAUSE OF COURSE THOSE COSTS. CAN VARY DEPENDING UPON THE REGION AND THE DEMAND- AND YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE NATURE OF THE HOTEL THE LESS WE ABILITY THE GREATER THE PURCHASE PRICE MIGHT BE ON THE FRONT END. AND LEFT REHABILITATION YOU MIGHT SEE ON THE BACK WE NEED TO THE BACK AND SO YOU ALL THERE THERE'S A VARIETY RIGHT AND THEN THE LOWER QUALITY OF THE HOTEL. MOTEL MIGHT REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT MORE REHABILITATION FOR. LOOKING SO. PEOPLE ARE ACROSS. THOUGH AGAIN THOSE COSTS ARE GOING TO BRING BASIS AND WHAT WHAT WORK WHAT WE BE YOUR HOUSE IF. THANK OUR- IT'S FAR LESS THAN CONSTRUCT PROCESS WITH THE COUNTY FOR THE NEW. PATIENT DEPENDING UPON THE REGION OR ANY PART OF THE METHOD RIGHT MODULAR HOUSING ME OFF A LITTLE BIT LESS. YOU SEE ANY ANYWHERE AS LOW AS A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PER UNIT UP TO THREE OR THOUSAND DOLLAR UNIT. WE OFFER. HOME CREATED ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN WHICH IS STILL QUITE QUITE LEFT THE. NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN REGION FIVE WE- THANK YOU BYE IF YOU CAN I. IF YOU PLEASE BE SO AS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WITHOUT ME HAVING TO GO TO THE WEBSITE AT THIS VERY MOMENT SO YOU GAVE ME THAT YOU GAVE US THE- THE COSTS FOR MODULAR HOUSING. BUT CAN YOU GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF THE BREAKDOWN BETWEEN A LOW END MOTEL VERSUS A HIGH END HOTEL WHAT IS THE AVERAGE. COST OF REHABILITATION IF NEEDED. BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY A AVERAGE COST THAT WE CAN SAY THAT. THAT WOULD BE A FAIR ANSWER FOR YOU BECAUSE THE- THE VERY SO WILDLY. IT WHAT IF NEED NEED NEED YOUR PERSONAL RIGHT. I'M THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPERTIES THAT WERE OFFICIALLY MOVING RIGHT. YOU KNOW SEEN DIEGO PURCHASED ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW RESIDENTIAL HOTELS REQUIRED NO REHABILITATION. AND SO THE ACQUISITION COSTS WITH LOCAL HIGH. ARE THERE ARE OTHER HOTELS MOTELS THAT REQUIRED SOME REHABILITATION. COSTS AND SO- WHILE WE ARE WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT RESOURCE TO DO IT IS WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. THAT IS-ESSENTIALLY DONE OVER TALKING ARE IN SOME CASES IT CAN GET IN THERE AND THE REHABILITATION COSTS CAN BE MORE THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE. OF THE CROSS THE BORDER THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IN A IN A FAIR WAY IT IS MUCH LESS THE NEW CONSTRUCTION WILL COUNT ACCOUNTABLE TO CAP OFF WITH THIS ACQUISITION COSTS AND. REHABILITATION KERR- I'M HAPPY I MEAN TO RECORD ACROSS BOARD THE AVERAGE ABOUT TO HUNDRED PER THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND. FOR UNIT. BUT AGAIN LIKE I SAID THAT WILL BURY PER PROP. ABOUT YEAH SUCH HUNDRED AND THIRTY THE PER UNIT IS THE A LOOK LIKE A LOW ONE MULTI. OR IS THAT A HIGH END HOTEL. BASS I'M JUST GOING BY BASED ON YOUR STATE THE AVERAGE COST ACROSS ACROSS THE PROGRAM WHAT THE **** NO MATTER WHAT THEY USE. THANK YOU AND JUST AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE WORK BEING DONE AND REHABILITATION THAT INCLUDES UNION LABOR. AND PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT IT IS- IT IS A REQUIREMENT OF COURSE THE PEOPLE UTILIZING THE PEOPLE EXEMPTION WITHIN HOME HE TO DO THAT- BUT I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS OF PERCENTAGES. THAT WOULD BE GREAT TANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED AND I WILL DO THAT BUT WE'RE NOT THE ENTITY THAT TRACKS THAT'S THE CORPORATE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THAT IS THE OVERSIGHT ENTITY. FOR THOSE SO THAT'S WHY. WE. WORK WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS. THANK YOU THAT'S UP TO THE VERY HIGH. TO UNDER. SO I ASSUME OR IS IT. APPROPRIATE TO ASSUME THAT THAT DATA IS BEING SHARED. I'D HAVE TO ASK OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE PROBATIVE INDUSTRIALIST INSTEAD THEY WERE ASKED IN THE SECOND ROUND THANK YOU TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE AS BIG AS THE REGULAR HERE TO THOSE OBLIGATIONS I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW. GET HOW THEY HAVE THAT DATA BUT I'M HAPPY TO THE WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP TRY TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU MISS WHAT'S- YES SIR THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I HAD A- COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR ALEJO- HOW MUCH DO WE NEED TO SPEND DOWN TO AVOID AGAIN LIMITS. ARE AND WHAT'S THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SPENDING IT ON. I THINK YOU AND I AM NOT OUR OFFICES CAN EXPECT I'M HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU TO THE RIGHT BOOK CAN GET YOU AN ANSWER ON THE MATTER I DON'T KNOW IF OUR FINANCE COLLEAGUES HAVE ANYMORE INSIDE ON THE SPECIFICS OF THAT. THE JAZZ. CHRIS COOK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I AS WELL NOT THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT IN THAT FIELD- I CAN GET BACK TO YOU BUT ONE THING I WOULD NOTE IS THIS TYPICALLY- FUNDING FOR HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE. I WOULD NOT COUNT TOWARDS THAT GAMBLIT. OKAY GREAT I'D BE HAPPY TO CONNECT WITH WITH YOU ALL ABOUT SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. WE DO HAVE AN LA A COLLEAGUE WITH MORE EXPERTISE IF YOU'D LIKE TO SORT OF CONNECT ON HOLLINGS HAD THAT BE GREAT IF ON. AND YEAH THANK YOU- AND- I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AS SORT OF A BIT BROADLY. BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON A LOT OF MOVING FACTORS UNFORTUNATELY THEY- THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IS VERY COMPLICATED AND- IT SORT OF DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH REVENUES ARE HAVING A SPECIAL FUNDS IT'S ON TRACK- BUT PROBABLY WHAT I CAN SAY IS. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES- I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER AMOUNTS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET THE SAU REQUIREMENTS AND SO THIS IS- SPENDING ON CAPITAL OUTLAY FOR EXAMPLE ADDITIONAL SPENDING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND THOSE ARE THE AMOUNTS THAT WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE RE PURPOSED FOR OTHER TYPES OF CELL EXCLUSIONS- IF. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE SORT OF RECONSIDERING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUST WAKE SENT JUST AS A FOLLOW UP I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CONTINUE TO ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND CLEARLY IT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING ACROSS THE STATE ORIGINALLY THERE WAS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CONSTRUCTIONS FOR A CONSTRUCTION FOR THREE POINT FIVE- MILLION NEW HOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHICH IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER AND NOW- THAT'S CHANGED TO TWO POINT FIVE BY TWENTY THIRTY. WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND A WIRE IS IT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN. LAST NEED OR IS IT LIKE WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE IN ADDRESSING. THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF THREE POINT FIVE VERSES THE NEW NUMBER OF TWO POINT FIVE AND EXTENDING IT FROM TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY THIRTY. THREE POINT FIVE NUMBER WAS NOT- NEED TO THE REPORT. AND ANALYSIS HELLO I WILL SPEAK TO THEIR METHODOLOGY THERE BUT I WILL STATE THAT NUMBER IN OUR STATE WHAT HOUSING PLAN. IS A REAL ACTIONABLE NUMBER IT IS IT IS BECAUSE COOLEY TOTAL IN TALLY OF WHAT EVERY DIRECTION PERHAPS DUE PLAN FOR UNDER THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION PROCESS. SO IT IS THE ACTUAL REAL LIKE WORKABLE WE CAN HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT NUMBER THROUGH THE HOUSING ELEMENT PASS AND ARE FORTUNATE IN OVERSIGHT OF THE- BERMAN OF COURSE YOU NEED. FOR FUNDING IN OTHER LAWS LET'S PASSED MANY LONGER OVER YOU TO HELP FACILITATE ARE GREATER POWER. BUT THIS IS A NOT A HERO NUMBER THIS IS NOT A PACKET NUMBER THIS IS A REAL CHANCE. ALL IN THE REQUIREMENT AND STATUTE. WE'RE A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION NUMBER WAS NOT A REQUIRED. NUMBER ITS STATUTE BECAUSE IT IS TIED TO THE MARINA REAL TANGIBLE HOUSING BUBBLE COMMITTEES MUST PLAN FOR AN WITH EXPECTED NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE BUILT WITH THIS ROUND OF FUNDING. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE BUDGET. ITEM FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LIKE NEED TO STILL TRY TO. ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I KNOW WE'RE STILL IN THE- OKAY I JUST IT MADE SENSE THAT I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- GET INTO. THE WATER OKAY NO THAT'S THAT'S A FAIR POINT MISTRAL STAYED HOME STATE OF MY APOLOGIES- OKAY WELL LET'S LET'S SET UP. HASSEL LET'S PARK THAT QUESTION FOR WHEN WE GET TO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT IT IS SOMETHING OF INTEREST. IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. NORMENT HERE LET'S MOVE ON THEN TO- ISSUE HOLD ON A SECOND. ISSUE NUMBER THREE- WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSINGS HOUSING PROPOSALS. I THINK YOU'RE ON AGAIN MYSTERONS THEATER SHOULD WE BEGIN WITH MISS MORALES. I THINK IT'S NAY LUCKILY I'LL LOOK AT THAT AND IF YOU DECIDE YOU KNOW IF THE FIRST. PLEASE COMPLETE CONTINUE. YES HAPPY TO DO THAT SO- WHAT YOU SEE IN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL- THAT REFLECTED JANUARY BUDGET VOCAL AND THE RELATED BCPS HERE- ARE A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS AND THEY SEEK TO BUILD ON- USING A QUALITY IF YOU COULD BUILD ON THE VALUES THAT I ARTICULATED FROM THE WHITE HOUSE- AND SO THEY FOCUS ON A COUPLE THINGS THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON PRODUCTION CONTINUED PRODUCTION. ARE THERE'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT- IN FUSION OF PROPOSALS AROUND PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION AS WELL OF OUR PORTAL HEALTH. SO ON PRODUCTION- TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE CO BENEFIT OF PRODUCING HOUSING BUT ALSO DOING SO IN WAYS THAT CAN HELP US REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MORE BEING SUGGESTED TALKING PERCEPTOR GRANT PROGRAMS. OUGHT TO FOCUS ON HELPING GET THOSE PARCELS READY BROWNFIELD WORLD URBAN. AND RURAL. IT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO COULD BE THAT THE PREPARATION OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE FORCED TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON THE PARCELS- AND WITH AN EXTENSION YOU KNOW THE EXTENSION WAITING THE DESIRE FOR THE NEW VEHICLE USE AND THEREFORE LOWER GHG EMISSIONS- YOU ALSO GET A THREE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED REFORM HOUSING FOR SINGLE NEED PROGRAM. THAT HE ADMINISTERED ON BEHALF OF. THE ALSO WHICH IS THE ORDER PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO ALIGN INVESTMENTS- WITH THE CALL IT'S A PRETTY MORE AFFORDABLE. HOUSING YOU ALSO SEE OUR MILLION COMMERCIAL. INTO HOUSING. YOU CAN. IT IN A HUNDRED NO DOLLARS TO. HELP OUR EFFORTS BUILD NUCLEAR AND LAN CONSIDER YOU SPEAK ACCESSIBLE. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PER. ARE FOR OUR OWN PROTECTION IN EACH YEAR BUT IT YOU ALSO SEE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THE STATE. LOCAL TAX CREDIT WORTH AND THE PERPETRATORS. AND YOU BILLION FOR THE FOR MAKING HEALTH PRODUCTION. AND BY THE SOUTH CALIFORNIA. STATE GETS ITS. BUT YOU AS IMPORTANT AS I AT THE AT THE CONTINUE. NEW CONSTRUCTION IS THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR RESERVE HOUSING NEVER THE FOR TO. SO YOU SEE TWO ONE MILLION PROPOSED TO NERVOUS- IN WHAT WE GET OUR LOW USED. INCLUDING ENERGY RETROFIT AND TOWARD. HOUSING OFFERS THERE BEING THE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. OIL AND OTHER VERY HE'SOUR EFFORTS TO. EXPAND WHAT WE DO AROUND AND THEY- HOMES- IT'S REALLY CRITICAL. OFF ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE PROPOSE TO. EXPAND OUR WORKFORCE IN MAKING SURE THOSE PROPERTIES ARE- RETAINED FOR THE USES OF COURSE AND TO MAKE CRITICAL HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AS NECESSARY. TO HELP THEM. REGAIN AND SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL AROUND A HUNDRED MILLION TO EXPAND OUR OLD CAR IMPROPER PROGRAM. IT'LL END BY MENTIONING AS THEY DID EARLIER ON THE CALENDAR OF ALL OF OUR EXISTING INVESTMENTS IT IS AVAILABLE ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON ITS WEBSITE. FOR EXAMPLE ARE CAN I OUR SECOND OF I'M GOING TO THE HOUSING STELLARATOR ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION JUST RELEASED AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO RELEASED THE SUPERNOVA. OF MEAT MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS LOCALLY HOUSING PROGRAM THE JUST SORT OF PROGRAMMED STRUCTURED GRANT PROGRAMS EXISTING DOLLARS AND THE DIFFERENCE I THINK IT WILL PREVENTION PROGRAM- AB. REALIZING WHAT EIGHTY FOUR SUGGESTED THAT SHOULD BE OUT AT THE END OF. SO THESE ARE A LOT A LOT OF REFER FIRST BILL OUT EVEN AFTER MAKE PROPOSALS. ARE HAPPY ADDRESS THE. THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM THE OHIO BY POUND IF I WHAT THE A. L. I'M OUR OFFICE RECENTLY REAL A BUT- OUTLINED OUR COMMENTS THE GOVERNOR. I'M HELPING. THOSE ARE FOR BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED IN THE PROJECT HIGHLIGHTED PEOPLE DID POINT. ONE IS A KNOW THE FOR SECOND BENEFITS AND I BY THE MINUTE. BUILDING MORE DENSELY ADDRESSING THE STATE I'M HOW GOALS WE SHOULD KNOW THAT IT HAS MERIT- BUT MORTGAGE ON THAT FRONT THE LONG TERM WILL BE FOR THE NECESSARY TO FULLY ALIGN THE STATE'S HOUSING. AND CLIMATE GOALS. WE BE IN A COLLECTIVE THE HOUSING FOR. WERE SORT OF BILL MORE HOW ACROSS STATE PROVIDE. YOU KNOW HOW UNITS ARE PRECISELY WHERE IT'S THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR AT THIS POINT. AND SO HE GET MISTER. FULLY FLESHED OUT STAND HOW DOES THE WORK WILL BE GIVEN BE IMPORTANT. ANOTHER ELEMENT THAT WE WOULD NOTICE- I MEAN. IT DOESN'T ALLEGE THE DRINKING AGE ON HOW THE COLLECTION THE COLLECTIVE PACKAGE OF HOUSING PROPOSAL TO ALIGN WITH RECENT POLICY CHANGES. SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECENTLY I'M STREAMLINED THAT PROCESS FOR APPROVING FIFTY TEXAS. YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW OLD THIS ARMENIAN ALIGN WITH SORT OF MEETING ITS- BROADER POLICY GOALS. I'M COULD BE AFFECTED AS WELL- AND WE'RE WORKING WITH SOME. HAVE INDICATED EARLIER TODAY IS THE ABOUT THE STATE OF LONG TERM EFFECTS IMPASSE. IN HOUSING- CAN YOU ABOUT WHAT LONG TERM. ON THAT WILL BE EMPTY AT THE WILL LIKE HAVE A- TO FISCAL ROLE TO- IT'S- THE LONGER TERM. THE FACT THE FINAL QUESTION WHICH NOT THAT. ALLOCATED FUNDING- FOR EXPLICIT PURPOSES WOULD ALLOW. STATE TO ALLAH MORE FOR TOWARD HELPING TO OTHERWISE COULD BE. THANK YOU. FINANCE CHRIS WHAT DEPARTMENT FINING NO FURTHER COMMENTS BUT OF HOPE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN EIGHT CITY WALK US THROUGH THE QUESTIONS AND OF THE STAFF COMMENTS PLACE. SO YOU HAVE A BILL IN ORDER WILL THAT WORK FOR YOU. THE FRST QUESTION I SEE IS WHAT. WE DISCUSS WHAT PROGRAMS REQUIRE HOUSING COMPLIANCE IS THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS. WE CAN GO BY ORDER THANK YOU SIR I'M STILL HOUSING ELEMENT COMPLIANCE IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. OR FUNDING DISBURSED TO LOCALITIES THROUGH THE SB TWO REVENUE. ARE WHAT WE CALL THE PERMANENT LOCAL HOUSING ALLOCATION THAT IS- IT'S GOT YOU IT'S ALSO REQUIRED FOR THE PORTIONS OF THE RECENT TWENTY NINETEEN. GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION STUDENTS ALL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM- IT'S REQUIRED FOR THE LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND PROGRAM. PORTABLE HEALTH INSISTING. PROGRAM IT IS REQUIRED SB CALTRAIN THE STATE. FRANCE AND IT IS REQUIRED FOR HOME GRANTS THAT ARE FEDERAL SOURCES THAT ARE AWARDED TO YOU- NOT A TITLE JURISDICTION EACH YOU GET MINISTERS- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A LOCAL HOUSING TRUST FUND PROGRAM. ALL OF THOSE REQUIRE HOUSING ON THE COMPLAINTS AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD. SHOW- THAT WOULD LOOK UP THE TRUST FUND IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES IT TO BE COMPLIANT THE TIME OF THE APPLICATIONS. MIDDLE EAST. ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT WOULD LOOK IN THE BOX AND- NO I GUESS I EIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE IT- CAN WE GO BACK TO MY ORIGINAL QUESTION- THAT I HAD ASKED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL SO WITH THIS THIS HOUSING FUNDING INVESTMENT HOW MANY UNITS ARE ANTICIPATED. LET ME LET ME GET THOSE NUMBERS TALLIED I HAVE BEEN BY PROGRAM AND SINCE I'M KIND OF STILL TALKING TO YOU I'M GONNA NEED SOMEONE TO SEND ME THOSE NUMBERS ALL HAVE BEEN WITH YOU WITHIN MINUTES- BECAUSE WE KIND OF A TALIBAN. ECT SO- ON THE OVERALL NUMBER I IF SOMEONE COULD THERE ARE CHRIS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM HER. OUR ALL HAPPY PROVIDE THAT THE AND- THAT'S WHAT. WHAT ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY FOR TO AVE THE NUMBERS READILY AVAILABLE. FOSTER WHAT PROGRAM I MEAN HAPPY TO ANSWER WHAT PROGRAM WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT. MAYBE MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I KNOW THAT YOU HAD. EXPRESSED QUITE A BIT OF INTEREST IN HOW MANY UNITS WERE ACTUALLY BUILT. UP WITH A CONSTRUCTION OFFER OUR BIGGEST KIND OF PROGRAMS LOCALLY HOUSING PROGRAM YEAH I G. PROGRAM AGENCY WHICH WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT OTHER VETERANS HOUSING ON THE PREVENTION PROGRAM THE DISCERNING PROGRAM. ALL TOLD- IN THE LAST SEVERAL FUNDING CYCLE TO PRODUCE FORTY ONE THOUSAND FUNDED UNITS- COMPLETE AND CONSTRUCTED ARE A LITTLE OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED UNITS THERE ARE QUITE A FEW- UNITS IN CONSTRUCTION IN FACT I WOULD SAY RIGHT AT THE PRECIPICE OF REALIZING- ALL THE BENEFITS THAT WE WANTED TO SEE. FROM ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE LAST YOUR PROP ONE- AND OTHER RELATED FUNDING SO WE HAVE OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND UNITS INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT NOW ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THAT ARE AWARDED TO GET TO BE IN CONSTRUCTION BUT I WOULD ADD THAT WE EXPECT MANY OF THOSE TO BE IN CONSTRUCTION THIS YEAR. ESPECIALLY GIVEN HOW THE ACCELERATOR FUNDING ON ESPECIALLY THE- ENABLING WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE TRADITIONAL. FINANCES TAX A BOMB AND MANY OTHERS OF COURSE THOSE WELL IT WILL ONE ZERO. THAT PIECE OF MY WHETHER THE EXTERNAL. OR THE FACT ABOUT AFTER BIRTH BROWN WITH. EIGHTY DAYS SO WE'RE RIGHT ON REST OF THE BEING QUITE YOU- NOTHING GETS BUILT ON THE- LIKE I SAID. CURRENTLY OVER THIRTEEN IN. EXPECT MORE. COMING YEAR FOR EXAMPLE IF. ALL THOSE PROJECTS THAT WE JUST BUDGET IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER BIRTH. I THOUGHT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT'S ANOTHER TWENTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS- OBVIOUSLY HOKEY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS AN OVER THE COUNTER- BASIS AND YOU HAVE. ALL THOSE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IT'S BEEN A DIRT BIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO BE- ACTUALLY MADE WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS OF A WORK. AND SO WE SEE AN ALREADY WORKING FOR FIRST ROUND QUITE A FEW ALTHOUGH ALMOST ALL OF UNITS COMING ONLINE IN THE FIRST ROUND. AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THAT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR MAR REFERENCE AS WE MAKE THE OVER THE COUNTER FOR HOPING TO FOR HELP AND BEYONCE- AND LIKE I SAID WE CONTINUE TO RELEASE FUNDING FOR A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS SO THE NUMBERS ARE FLUID AND CHANGING AS WE MAKE THE WORK OF COURSE. WE ARE SEEING QUITE A BIT FOR THAT EIGHT BILLION I TALKED ABOUT THE FORTY ONE THOUSAND UNITS THAT WE'VE TALKED WE'VE INVESTED IN- TO. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THOSE COME ONLINE AND. IN FACT MOST OF THEM ARE INFRASTRUCTURE. YEAH BUT THE- QUESTION HALF TO A LAB. I KNOW PROVIDED YOUR BUT STAFF WITH. A LIKE A DOCTOR. TRYING TO TESTIFY IN THE SENATE. SO THAT MADE IT WHEN YOU- BUT HAPPY TO A LAB. ON THAT DOCTOR. OR. FOR THANK YOU AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS A LOT OF AND- L. OF. DOLLARS GOING INTO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE STATE'S BIGGEST CONCERN WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING. AND SO WHAT I'M- I THINK WE WERE ALL TRYING TO GET AT IS MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED IN THE PAST WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T CAN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY GETTING THAT REPORT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT MHP CREATES A LOT OF HOUSING. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S- PACKAGE DOESN'T INCLUDE FUNDING FOR MHP AND- CURIOUS AS TO WHY THAT IS. WELL WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR PROP ONE. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF RELEASED IT'S PART OF OUR SUPER NO BUT THEY'LL BE OUT THERE THIS MONTH AND THEN WILL BE ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING IN THE FALL IT'S- NOT THE FOLLOWING YEAR- SO THERE IS STILL RESOURCES FROM HP. LIKE I SAID MORE WORK OUR JOB IS TO DEPLOY THOSE FUNDS- I LEAVE IT TO YOU GUYS THE CRAFT HOW HOW WHAT YOU THINK THE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS MIGHT EAT- I WILL SAY THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THANK YOU FOR INDULGING OF BEING PATIENT WITH ME. HELLO TALLY THE NUMBER IS AROUND THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND UNITS- THAT WOULD BE AT THE STATE OP FIVE BY THE ABOUT THE PROPOSED THAT I LAID OUT THERE- BUT. I'M HAPPY TO- YOUR LAB RIGHT WHAT THOSE PRO IS GIVING TERMS OF WHAT THE- THAT THE STEP. YEAH WE WANT THAT YOU BUILT. UNIT THAT IS BILL. THROUGH THE HOUSEHOLD ALLOWING HELP COUNCIL. AND DOUBLE. OF I HAVE. IN MY- ALL CASES. MANY HOUSEHOLD OVER THE LIFE OF THE HOUSING BECAUSE WE STAFF FOR REQUIRED THAT UNITS TO BE AFFORDABLE FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS LIKE HOME HE OF THE XCELERATED DOES IT MAKE THOSE ARE THOSE LOOKING AT A MUCH FASTER RATE EVERY EVERY HOPE UNIT. RAIDED THE HOME OF HOUSEHOLD OFF THE STREET. ND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE METRICS I WOULD DEFINITELY. CONSIDER WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AS IF THEY WERE HOUSING PLAN IT KNOWLEDGE. WE HAVE UNDER INVESTED IN UNDER PRODUCED IN HOUSING FOR MANY DECADES AND SO- WE NEED TO BUILD THESE UNITS OF PASSAGE YOU CAN'T YOU SEE. KIND OF MORE UNIQUE PROGRAMS LIKE HOKEY AND ACCELERATOR KIND OF CIRCUMVENT WHAT IS THAT TRADITIONAL FUNDING PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE A COUPLE YEARS. OF A WEALTH OF. THE PEAK FOR TAX CREDITS AND- FACT THE FUNDS- ONE OF THE REASONS WE- ACCELERATE FOR. WHAT PURPOSE FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAD A LOT OF PROJECTS READY TO GO THAT ROUTE IF WAITING THEIR TURN. AND WE WERE OF THE- SYSTEM DID NOT CONTEMPLATE. COMPETITION AND HAD TO ADJUST YOUR LAST TWO YEARS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE RECORDS OFFICE YOU'RE- UP EIGHT THE- PROGRAMS TO OFFICIALLY ALLOW FOR COMPETITION THAT BETTER REFLECTS. HOW THESE PRODUCTS CAN COMPETE. IN THE MEANTIME WHERE WE CAME IN WITH THE EXCEL WORD- FUNDING TO HELP WITH THOSE PROJECTS ALONG SO- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A HOPE THAT- ARE STATE FUNDED THAT'S WITH. TV'S AND- WILL WILL COMPETE FAVORABLY IN THAT AND FACT THAT IT. AND ABU SYSTEM. BUT WE ARE FOR OR WHAT DOES THIS CAN PER THAT WHY YOU ALSO THE AMOUNT. OF IS THAT CIRCUMVENT THAT MICHAEL. EXCEL YOU OFF SEE A NEED FOR PRESERVE WHAT WE ARE HAVE A- IT IS LOOKS FOR US TO. BOB HERTZBERG SOMETHING ALREADY IN OUR PARKING LOT OR THAN TO GET TO BE. THANK YOU I A- THE CAR TO BE HONEST I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT OF TRYING TO REACH. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF TWO POINT FIVE MILLION- HOUSING UNITS WITHIN BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS JUST EIGHT YEARS AWAY SO. IF THE PROPOSAL NOW IS THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND. ANNUALLY OR EVERY TO EVERY TWO YEARS MY APOLOGIES THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND EVERY TWO YEARS. HOW DOES THAT GET US TO THE TWO POINT FIVE. WELL THE THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND THAT WOULD BE GREAT WOULD BE WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING THIS REMEMBER WE HAVE SIX POINT FIVE BILLION ON TOP OF THAT ARE YOU JUST GOING AT THIS YEAR. WE ARE STILL SEEING THE REALIZATION OF COURSE OF THE INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE PREVIOUS RECORDING THOSE ARE JUST NOW GETTING CONSTRUCTING COME ALIVE. I ALSO OF COURSE MENTIONED THERE THE STATE IS NOT THE ONLY THUNDER. UP LOCAL HAVE RESOURCES THEY CONTROL ARE OFTEN THOSE ARE FEDERAL RESOURCES THE FLOW DIRECTLY FOR LARGE AND WITH THEIR DIFFERENT. OUT THERE ARE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WE YOU KNOW IT'S JUST A FAKE CERTAINLY- AND IF YOU TO FLOW. AND SO THERE ARE MANY KINDS THERE ARE MANY OR MANY PARTS TO THE SOLUTION IT'S NOT JUST THE STATE'S OR ENTITIES FUNDED SOLUTIONS. THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED THE PARTNERSHIP. AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT AND WITH OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS RIGHT- THERE ARE RESOURCES IN ADDITION TO WHAT. THE STATE PROVIDES TO HELP BUT YOU. THANK YOU I. TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS I'M GONNA. ASK MY COLLEAGUE MS MS WAKES UP A COUPLE OF HERSELF THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU AND SERVE I MISSED THIS BUT JUST SPECIFICALLY WHICH PROGRAMS ARE PRODUCING THE MOST HOUSING. THE GREAT QUESTION- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD IT WOULD BE AT SOME PROGRAM TO PRODUCE THE MOST BECAUSE THEY- HAVE THE MOST MONEY ALLOCATED. RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE SEE IT WE SEE SOMETHING THAT ACTUAL SPEED URGENCY. AT HOME KEY THANKS AT A LOWER PRICE POINT IN PREGNANCY THAT'S ONLINE MUCH QUICKER. THAN THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION. HE WE GET A LOT OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WE HAVE PASSED THE STATE HOUSING BONDS WITH RECENT ONE BEING PROP ONE AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO YOU SEE THOSE AMOUNTS TO BURY I WOULD SAY THE MOST THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER PROGRAM AND HE KIND OF LIKE FOUNDATIONAL PROGRAM IS THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER HEALTH MINISTER YOU HAVE TARGETED GOALS TO THEM AS WELL. SO YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THE NETFLIX ACCOUNT PROGRAM THE VETERANS HOUSING HOPE BETTER PROGRAM OR THE FOR THE HEALTHY SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. SOMETIMES THOSE MAY PRODUCE FEWER UNITS. THEY ARE SPEAKING HAVE A BENEFIT OF DOING SOMETHING LIKE ENDING HOME. OR THE COUNCIL OR- IF YOU CAN TO OUR CLIMATE WILL AND SO I'M THERE ARE DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS OF COURSE WHEN YOU TRY TO MEET LOCAL. I AM. AND POLITICAL THE HOUSING FOR IS THE MOST KIND OF DIRECT. IT'S AFFORDABLE FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS. AND JUST UP ON THAT- THANK YOU BRING THAT UP HOW TOTALS LEFT TO GO OUT. IN AN H. P. AND WHAT WE DO IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE SINCE. WILL AWARD AT ALL BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. BUT STILL WILL TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL NOBLE WITH IMAGE IN IT. EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR SUPPORT FOR WILL HAVE ONE THIS. MONTH WILL HAVE ANOTHER NEXT YEAR. ABOUT I THINK TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION LEFT IN A MEETING. SO THAT WOULD BE GOING OUT FOR APPLICATIONS NEXT. SPRING TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT WOULD MAKE THOSE AWARDS LEAVING TWENTY TWENTY. AFTER WHICH WE WOULD. ACTUALLY WITH. SORRY AFTER WHICH WOULD YOU WOULD YOU THE MORE. AFTER TWENTY. WE HAVE A THE NEXT WE HAVE A NO BUT THIS WILL WORK FOR IT AND AN OPEN NEXT MARCH FOR. GOT IT OKAY. AND THEN THE AWARDS OF CORPORATE FOLLOW MID YEAR PROBABLY MID LATE YEAR THE FINAL SEMESTER MHPS NOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE OUR PROGRAMS DO WITH THEM THEIR DELETE EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR AND THAT INCLUDES THE MULTIPLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WE'RE GOING TO DO ROLL CALL AGAIN FOR OUR VOTE ONLY- ITEMS WHICH ARE ITEMS ONE AND THEN THREE TO SEVEN. THE MOTION WAS THE I'M SORRY ROLL CALL PLEASE FOR THE MEMBERS ARE ABSENT. AT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PREVIOUS BUDGET COOPER HI THIS AREA. THE HI A MOTION TO AND- VOTE ONLY ISSUE NUMBER TWO PLEASE COOPER HI THIS AREA HI. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. MR ON STATE YOU'RE STILL ON THE HOT SEAT. THANK YOU- OKAY SO- ON ON NUMBER FOUR IF YOU SEE HERE IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WEEKEND RE OF ALLAH DOES THAT COMMITTEE OFF. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO RE APPROPRIATE AROUND TWENTY TWO MILLION FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND UP WITH PURPOSE. FOR THE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY PROGRAM SO A WORK MADE WAY BACK WHEN THAT PROGRAM WAS CREATED TWENTY FOURTEEN. THEY HAVE AN E. COMMERCE DEADLINE. AND THERE ARE A COUPLE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR VARIOUS REASONS READ REASONS- YOU KNOW NOT A NOT NOT AMONG THEM OF COURSE ALL THE THINGS WE HAVE WE CAN TALK ABOUT BUT- YOU KNOW THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER THINGS. I'M THAT IT. OUR TECH POTENTIALLY IN JEOPARDY OF MEETING THE DEADLINE AND IF. IF THERE'S NOT A ADJUSTMENTS THE PROJECT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUNDS WERE BACK THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND ASSISTING BEING THEY WILL YOU FOR HOUSE. SO OUR- GUESTS AND IS THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. THOSE DOLLARS SO THAT I CAN. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SORRY- ELLIE- FIRST. ALLEY NO ISSUES TO RAISE WITH THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CHRIS CROOK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FURTHER COMMENTS BUT HELPFUL QUESTIONS. OKAY I WOULD JUST ASK- MR ALMOST AND IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS- PRESENTED BY STAFF. OUR STAFF COMMENTS I SHOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE GREAT I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY WITH BEING A CAMPER AND EVERYTHING TO MULTI TASK AB ALL THE- ALL THE DOCUMENTS. COULD YOU PLEASE. LET ME KNOW WHAT THE QUESTIONS ARE. AND I MAY BE ABLE TO PASS ITS MY COLLEAGUES WERE AVAILABLE. I THINK. SO SHORT ON THE AGENDA PAGE TWENTY NINE SO THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE UNDER STAFF COMMENTS HAS REQUESTED INFORMATION ON THE- ON THE EIGHT PROJECTS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WHEN IT IS. WHEN IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE EIGHT PROJECTS WILL BE COMPLETE COMPLETE THESE PROJECTS. YES I KNOW THAT- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A FUND YOUR WALLET THE DELAYS I JUST TODAY. LEAVE IT NOW ONLY TWO PROJECTS THAT ARE IN JEOPARDY. I I'M HAPPY TO- YEAH. I GUESS WE'RE GONNA SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THESE PROJECTS RIGHT SO DOES THE THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY PRODUCT MAKE IT RIGHT- AMONG THEM SPEAKING OTHER FINAL RESOURCES- AFTER TWO YEARS IF YOU MAY KNOW THERE'S BEEN A SEVERE OVER SUBSCRIPTION EVERY PROGRAM UP UNTIL THE ACCELERATOR HOME HE EVERY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM WITH MR. WELL I DON'T SEE A LOT ABOUT THE TAX RATES OR TAX EXEMPT BONDS ONE OF THESE THEIR CLIENTS. THAT THE MODEL BEFORE BEFORE BUT THE FINANCE FOR A COUPLE DECADES NOW AND SO OFTEN AND WE SAW A VERY VASTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED ENVIRONMENT THERE OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE PROPOSE THE EXCAVATOR PROGRAM IS TAKING MANY ITERATIONS WITHIN THE PROJECT. AS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR. ARE OFTEN THERE CAN BE OTHER OTHER. OTHER OTHER REASONS KNOW MANY. OF COURSE HAVE NOT ASPECTS THAT IS JUST ABOUT BUT OF THE TAX CREDIT AND COMMITTEES. OR EXTENSIONS DURING THE AND- SO- YEAH THESE ARE THERE TWO NOW THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE POTENTIALLY IN JEOPARDY. OF ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION IN DEMAND- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO RETAIN THESE DOLLARS WITH THIS. ASK FOR HOUSING PURPOSES OTHERWISE THOSE PROJECTS WOULD. POTENTIALLY NOT HAPPENED- AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN GET EVERY PROJECT THAT CAN BE BUILT ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. AND SO- YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALSO. SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IN THE WORLD. WE NEED PROGRAM IS THAT HAVE A TRANSIT OKAY. SO I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE PROJECTS THERE HAS PAUL HAS. SUPPOSEDLY NOT ON. HOUSING PIECE BUT ON THE TRANSIT HE'S- I. SO THEY HAVE DO TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS WILL INCLUDE. SINCE OF A FUNDING SOME ROADBLOCKS IT'S- OUR OTHER H. H. AS THE ALLOCATIONS HAVING THE SIMILAR ISSUES. ON THE LAST LITTLE BIT. THIS THIS THIS WITH DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FUNDS EVER SINCE THAT I BELIEVE THE FUNDS WERE- IT SHE IS THE APPROPRIATE AFTER THAT SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS- I GUESS WHAT I CAN SAY IS IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THE LATE THERE CERTAINLY WERE A NUMBER OF AGENCY FUNDED PROJECT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET GOING WITH THE ACCELERATOR FUNDS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS OCCURRING WITHIN THE FINAL PIECE OF FINANCING IN TAXPAYERS OFFICE MEDIAN FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE WHERE THOSE PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO SEEK THE FINAL THE FINANCING. IS THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS OR HOUSES ASSEMBLY PROJECTS TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE TYPICALLY INFILL PROJECTS THEY'RE TYPICALLY DOING TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS AS WELL AND WITHIN THE METRICS. AS I MENTIONED THE DEBT LIMIT OUT THINKING THEY COULD NOT REALLY CONTEMPLATE A SCORING SYSTEM THAT WAS COMPETITIVE AND SO THE ONLY THE ONLY WAY THE TIEBREAKER ESSENTIALLY WAS THE COST OF THE HOUSE ARE YOU CAN GET THE PROMOTE EFFICIENCY SO MANY MANY WHAT HOUSING IN THE BOOKING THESE PROJECTS WORKED WITH ALL THEIR- NOTHING. THEY WERE GREAT PROUD ELECT I SAID IT'S A OF THESE PRO THAT HAVE COME BENEFITS OF IN FROM INFO FROM COST. IF WE'RE GETTING THE FINISH. IN A FIGHT IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE SO YES THERE ASSEMBLY THERE WE FREEDOM MOST OF THE- WITH THE. THANK YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU CLEAR SOMETHING YOU MENTIONED THAT THESE PRO. ARE MARKED. YET WE'RE PUTTING MORE FUNDING INTO THEM AND THEY'RE TAKING LONGER SO WHAT'S THE RATIONALE TO THAT. WELL WE ARE THINKING THAT THE FORT WORTH STILL NEEDS PROGRAM AS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE MANY YEARS AGO DOES HAVE TO GO BACK A COUPLE OF NOT ONLY CREATING HOUSING THE CLOAKING THEIR AND YOUR TRANSIT. LARGELY AT. THAT COST MORE MONEY- I THINK. IT'S THERE ARE MULTIPLE BENEFITS AND THAT'S WHY COST. AND LIKE I SAID DELAYS WERE A FUNCTION OF THE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM. AND THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT OUT IF YOU COMMITTEE. OF WHICH DID NOT HAVE A COMPETITIVE SCORING STRUCTURE WHEN THEY WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED SO THE LAST TWO YEARS. IF YOU NEED HELP OR NOTHING YES THEY CAN BE FORMER FINANCE OPERATORS OFFICE THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHO ARE ALL REPRESENTED ON THE COMMITTEES HAVE BEEN. PUSHING FOR REGULATORY CHANGES TO CHANGE THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO ALLOW FOR BETTER. A BETTER REFLECTION OF EIGHT- A PUBLIC BENEFIT ACHIEVING BENEFIT WITH THOSE AND THE CHEAPEST PROJECTS WITH- GETTING FUNDED THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WERE THE BEST PROJECT NECESSARILY LIKE I SAID BEFORE HOUSING. IN MANY PROGRAM. THE NEW POLITICAL PROJECTS THAT SEEK TO THIRTY FOUR HOMELESS DOES COST MORE MONEY TYPICALLY- SO THEY WERE OFFICIALLY STARTED NEED. LARGELY BECAUSE THAT THOSE- AT THE FUNDING. THANK YOU MISS WHAT'S- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND UP FOR JUMPING ON HER LITTLE BIT BUT I SAID A COUPLE OTHER FOLLOWUP QUESTIONS SO THAT THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TO STREAMLINE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO MAKE THE PROGRAMS MORE EFFICIENT TO GET THE MONEY OUT FASTER AND ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS AS QUICKLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. THE BUDGET PROPOSES CREATING A NEWER ADAPTIVE REUSE PROGRAM WHICH RUNS COUNTER TO THAT GOAL WHITE WHY DO WE NEED A NEW PROGRAM. WE DON'T BELIEVE IT CALPERS THE GOAL- AT ALL IN FACT. THE FIRST BILL LANGUAGE THAT WE'VE SUGGESTED HERE WHAT ALLOW US TO APPLY IT. TO ANY OF OUR PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN GET THE MONEY OUT AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. IF SO WE WOULD BE TYING IT TO OTHER PROGRAMS- NOW THE REASON WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE- I'M A LITTLE BIT OF THE ESSENCE HERE. WHEN IT COMES TO A DOCTOR PREVIOUS. WE TALK A LITTLE BIT- EARLIER RIGHT ABOUT. CLUNKY AND WE REALLY ABLE WITH SWIFT ACTION THAT THE STATE TOOK CARE TO ACQUIRE MANY DIFFERENT ASSETS. WERE DISTRESSED BECAUSE AND- IT SO WE MAY BE IN THAT SIMILAR SITUATION RIGHT NOW. WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTRESSED ASSETS AT. PRESENT YOU KNOW WE MAY TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT TO ACQUIRE ORCHESTRA INTO HOUSING. BUT YOU KNOW IN. THE FUTURE THEY MAY NOT THEY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE RECKLESS CERTAINLY ALREADY SEEN. NEED FOR THE MINISTRY COME BACK QUITE AGGRESSIVELY. AND YOU WERE YOUR OF THOSE. OFFICES ARE AVAILABLE SO THIS IS SPEAKING TO A I DID WHAT THE- BEING OF QUICK THAT. I THE BILL. YOU ADVANTAGE THANK YOU SO I IT WILL BE THREE BECAUSE WE STRUCK. YOU WILL BE ASKED TO ALLOW US TO- THAT WITH WITH WHATEVER PROGRAM YEP WE HAVE THE NEXT ONE TO DO THAT WOULD BE WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE BUT THAT WOULD COME OUT THIS FALL. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE BUDGET YEAR. OKAY AND LAST YEAR AB EIGHT SIXTEEN REQUIRED EIGHT CD TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL HOUSING TRUST FUND FOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IS IT TRUE THAT THE FEDERAL BUDGET IS PROPOSING TO RUN THAT FUNDING THROUGH HOME. WOULD THAT CHANGE YOUR ADMINISTRATION OF THE FUNDING AT ALL OR IMPACT YOUR ABILITY TO PRIORITIZE THE FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENTS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE FEDERAL RESERVE AS WELL LOW. WHO WILL WELCOME HOME. BUT LUCKILY WE TOOK THE ACTION ANY TV IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ACTUALLY CREATE STANDALONE VISION. OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE WE WERE TAKING ON SO MANY FEDERAL RESOURCES IF YOU DON'T WE ALREADY DID- SO THAT DIVISION OVERSEES ALL FEDERAL RESOURCES WHICH INCLUDE THE NATIONAL TRUST FUND. AND HOME SO WE PARTICIPATE IN CHALLENGES. THE POINT. THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS I KNOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF. WE'RE GONNA. MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. MR ON STATE. YES STILL APPRECIATE YOU PROVIDING- TWO OF OUR REQUESTS AROUND ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES SO- THIS IS TO- ESSENTIALLY HELPLESS RIGHT SIZE OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR ALL THE GROUP THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS- PROGRAMMATIC LEE OF COURSE ALL THE RESOURCES WE'VE GOTTEN BOTH START FEDERAL AND STATE. ALL THE DOZENS OF NEW HOUSING BILLS THIS ALL COME WITH WORKLOAD FORCIBLY BEEN QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN. OFTEN LOOKING UP IN THE FOR GIVING US THOSE POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THOSE LONGPROGRAMS ONE THING THAT HAPPENED OF COURSE IS SOME OF THE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS- ARE NOT CONTEMPLATED ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S A FLAT RATE SO IF YOU GROW AS WE HAVE QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY. OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. I THINK THAT. MISSION RIGHT IF YOU AND IN THE BACK THERE- YOU EE YOU SEE A NEED ACROSS. OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE SUPPORT LOCATIONS RIGHT- WHEN IT COMES TO I. T. WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN RESOURCES. WHAT IT COMES TO. THOSE AFFECTED. SO THAT THE BULK OF THEIR BUSES WITH THE RIGHT RIGHT SIDE FOR TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS THERE- WITH THE ADDITIONAL REQUEST FOR THREE POSITIONS FOR- I LOVE TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE BY WAY. OF MOBILE PHONE MAKE IT. INTO ALLOWED THREE MORE SPECTER'S. US INTO THAT FUNCTIONS- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A LOT OF A LOCAL PARTS OF THE STATE. WE ARE UNDERGOING. EVALUATION CURRENTLY ALSO IN YOU KNOW MANY OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE OUR OR- OUR- FUNDED THROUGH THE VARIOUS FEES THAT ARE IMPOSED UPON MOBILE HOME PARKS. WERE AT WORK THEY'RE GOING TO BE A VALUATION. ON THAT ASPECT AS WELL BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE ARE SEEING. A BIG NEED HELP FILLING WHAT. I TALK ABOUT. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PARKS HOW THIS FLIES. FIVE MILLION WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MORE OF THESE PARKS ARE REGULAR BASIS- AND THREE MORE BECAUSE WITHOUT TO AT LEAST INCREASE VOTER. THANK YOU MISTER ANSETT MY PAUL THAT I SAYING LAST NAME.

OUR FIRST IN PERSON PRESENTER AND TUFF FOR THIS YEAR WELCOME VERY COOL WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WHAT IT'S FOR MY CON. MAKE SURE THERE ARE MICROPHONES ON HELLO HELLO. OKAY CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME OKAY OKAY GREAT- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS HOLLY MARTINEZ THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE TO BE YOUR FIRST PERSON- TO JOIN YOU IN PERSON- AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER OUR ANNUAL REPORTS WHICH I HOPE YOU GET YOU GET A CHANCE TO SORT OF THOUSAND THROUGH AT YOUR LEISURE. AT THE COMMISSION YOU KNOW WE ARE WE WORK IN A CULTURALLY INCLUSIVE MANNER TO PROMOTE EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL WOMEN AND GIRLS AND TO ADD AN OFFER PERSPECTIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE GOVERNOR ABOUT WHAT THE NEEDS OF WOMEN ARE AT THE POLICY LEVEL. RIGHT NOW BUT WOMEN NEED IS TO B FRONT AND CENTER IN A FULLY EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA OR WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR BILLS PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS BROUGHT ON BY THE PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIA WOMEN FACE SIGNIFICANT WAGE GAPS. ALONG WITH OPPORTUNITY GAPS THAT MEAN THAT EVEN PRE PANDEMIC WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO EARN LOW WAGES AND LIVE IN POVERTY. THE COPA NINETY RECESSION WAS THE FIRST RECESSION IN WHICH MORE WOMEN THAN MEN LOST JOBS WHILE MEN HAVE NOT RECOUPED ALL THEIR JOBS IN ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT FROM THE PANDEMIC ONE MILLION FEWER WOMEN ARE STILL. ARE ONE MILLION FEWER WOMEN ARE IN THE WORK FORCE TODAY THAN AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. THE SHARP CONTRAST BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE LABOR WORK FORCE LIKELY REFLECTS THE AN EVEN CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TAKEN INTO THE PANDEMIC. WHICH HAVE CAUSED CONTINUED DISRUPTION IN SCHOOL AND CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES WE KNOW BLACK AND LYFT NEXT WOMEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS LOST THEIR JOBS AT ESPECIALLY HIGH RATES IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC. TO PUT IT IN REAL TERMS LOST WAGES EQUALS RENT THAT CAN'T BE PAID FALLING BEHIND IN MORTGAGES DIFFICULTY AFFORDING FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES. NOT BEING ABLE TO SAVE MONEY FOR HOMES AND IT MEANS LESS RETIREMENT SAVINGS IN THE LONG TERM. THESE KINDS OF ECONOMIC HURDLES CAN SHAPE A WOMEN'S FINANCIAL SECURITY AND THAT OF HER FAMILY FOR AN ENTIRE GENERATION OR MORE. IT'S AGAINST THIS BACKDROP AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS THAT WE HAVE EMERGED UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP WITH NEW MEMBERS TO LEAD THE CHARGE IN CREATING A GENDER EQUITABLE RECOVERY PLAN. WOMEN HAVE BEGUN WE HAVE BEGUN THIS WORK AT THE COMMISSION STARTING WITH THE WOMEN'S RECOVERY GRANT PROGRAM A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING TO SUPPORT WOMEN'S. MOST URGENT NEEDS. THE COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY APPROVED THE FINAL SELECTION OF OUR GRANTEES. TO SAY THERE WAS AN INTEREST IN THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

AND DOES THE AGENCY INTO. FUTURE HOMELESS PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE PLACED AT THE AGENCY OR MOVED TO ANOTHER LOCATION. YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME HERE ESPECIALLY DO THE AGE OF TWENTY WHICH I KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE MANY OF THE NUMBERS IN THE GOVERNOR PASSED RECENTLY REGARDING THE RECENT RESTRUCTURING OF COW ICIJ AND HAVING A CO CHAIR HOUSING AND HEALTH IN THIS IS YOU KNOW THAT IS DEFINITELY. OUR CHARGE AHEAD COMING OUT OF A STRONG FIRST QUARTER WITH MANY STATUTORY GOALS AND SO AND THAT IS WHERE OUR FOCUS IS AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT WAITING TO CONTINUE LOOKING FORWARD. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATE THAT IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS- WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT AND CAPMAN RESOLUTION GRANTS- MISTER DERON ARE YOU ONE AND IF SO- PLEASE- PLEASE BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS VICTOR DRAWN HERE WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU PLEASE BE CLOSER INTO THE MIKE PLACE. IS THIS BETTER. YES BUT- THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS BICKERED AROUND HERE WITH THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AND I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL UP FOR A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION AND ACCOMPANYING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CHANGES TO PROVIDE LOCAL ENTITIES WITH GRANTS IN SUPPORT OF PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS AND FOR RESOLVING CRITICAL IN CAMDEN ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS REQUEST BUILT ON THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME IN CAMP AND RESOLUTION PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR AND WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING. THIS FIRST ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM WE RECEIVE REQUESTS TO FUND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A PROJECTS FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIVING IN ENCAMPMENTS. THE NEED FOR A MUCH LARGER SCALE PROGRAM IS FURTHER REFLECTED IN THE MOST RECENT POINT IN TIME COUNT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WERE IN OVER TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WERE SHOWN TO BE EXPERIENCING. UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS THE HIGH STREET IN THE NATION. SO THIS REQUEST WOULD ALLOW US TO FURTHER INVEST IN FLEXIBLE AND INNOVATIVE ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION STRATEGIES. AND TECHNIQUES THAT- AT THE SCALE AND WITH THE URGENCY THAT'S NEEDED TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS- I WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND I ALSO HAVE WITH ME- COLLEAGUES FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY ON THE LINE. TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THAT FALL UNDER THEIR PURVIEW. THANK YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE ALLEY A PLACE OUR OFFICE RELEASED AN ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL I'M HOMELESSNESS- BUDGET PACKAGE THIS YEAR WITH WHICH THIS IS JUST ONE COMPONENT SUCH AS FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE ACCOUNT RESOLUTION THE SUBJECT OF. OF THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU AS WAS NOTED IN THE ADMINISTRATION PRESENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL WITH SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF THE PRIOR YEAR APPLICATION UP FROM FIFTY MILLION TO- FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND SINCE THIS IS A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN THE SCOPE- IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING TO A THIRD AFFECT HOW THE CENTERPIECE YOU SENSE THERE'S VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT ONE TIME PUBLICATION LAST YEAR. AND SO WE WOULD JUST RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE WITH FAST- WHICH TYPES OF INNOVATIONS YOU DON'T HAVE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WITH THE TIMELINE THE LEGISLATURE WILL REALLY. NOT BE ABLE TO SORT OF- THOSE ISSUES. HOW TO SORT OF BE FINE THE PROGRAM. TO REALLY NEED TO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT FINANCE. GOOD AFTERNOON BRITNEY THOMPSON APARTMENT FINANCE NOTHING ADD THIS TIME BUT AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ACTUALLY HOW DOES A CAL I. CH PLAN TO ACCES THE OUTCOMES OF THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING AND WHEN WILL THAT DATA BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR THE THIRTY SEVEN THAT'S NOT ACCESS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF MEASURES THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE TO CONTINUOUSLY COLLECT AND ASSESS THE OUTCOMES OF THIS FIRST ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM- WE WILL BE REQUIRING OUR GRANTEES TO PROVIDE ORDERLY PROGRAMMATIC REPORTS- THAT WE WILL BE ANALYZING ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE WILL BE REQUIRING OUR GRANTEES TO ENTER THEIR DATA ON THE PEOPLE THEY INTEND TO SERVE- INTO THE SYSTEM THAT FEEDS UP INTO THE STATE WIDE ALMOST THE STATE INTEGRATION SYSTEM SO THAT WE CONTRACT. SERVICES AND OUTCOMES TO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WE ALSO TEND TO- ESTABLISH A CONTRACT WITH THE RESEARCH AND EVALUATION FORM THAT WILL CONDUCT A DEEPER LEVEL OF OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM HAS A WHOLE BOTH ITS DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION AND ITS ULTIMATE OUTCOMES AFTER THE PROGRAM CONCLUDES- AND WITH RESPECT TO WIN THE STATE WILL BECOME AVAILABLE OF COURSE IT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM- AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE WE HAVE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE INTENDED AWARD HE'S FOR THIS FIRST ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM- AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH THOSE GUARANTEES. SO AT ONCE THOSE PROGRAMS ARE STOOD UP WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE OUR FIRST QUARTERLY REPORT LATE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR AND HAVE SOME INITIAL DATA SHORTLY THEREAFTER OF COURSE RECOGNIZING THAT THAT DATA WILL BECOME OF MORE REMOTE ROOM MORE ROBUST AS PROGRAMS ARE STOOD UP AND THERE'S TIME FOR THE SERVICE DELIVERY. STRATEGIES TO BE IMPLEMENTED. DOES THE IN CAP SO WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THE DATA FOR THE FIFTY MILLION THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ALLOCATED AND BEING WORKED ON WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN ONE WILL THAT REPORT BE READY. THE FIRST SET OF DATA WE ANTICIPATE TOWARDS THE END OF THIS YEAR AND THEN QUARTERLY DATA WILL BE AVAILABLE THEREAFTER. OKAY AND SO JUST ONE OF. BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT AS AS THAT MOVES FORWARD AS THE INCOMING PROGRAM HAVE THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT WERE CREATED FOR HAVE PROGRAMS LAST YEAR. G. KEVIN THE CURRENT AND CABIN RESOLUTION PROGRAM- COUNTERBALANCE GOALS ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN FOR HALF. THE HALF THE HOUSING THE HOUSING HOMELESSNESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE ENTIRE HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM AND SO THE PERFORMANCE GOALS THAT WE DESIGNED FOR THAT PROGRAM WERE SPECIFIC TO. MEASURING OUTCOMES FOR THE SYSTEM AT LARGE WHEREAS FORTY EVEN CAPTAIN RESOLUTION PROGRAM SINCE THE- OPPOSED PROJECTS ARE VERY TARGETED- WE WANTED TO ZERO WE HAD OUR PERFORMANCE GOALS AROUND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SERVED AND THE SPECIFIC OUTCOMES ACHIEVED WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS. FORTY PROPOSED A PROGRAM- WE WOULD BE ADDING ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND PERFORMANCE GOLD MEASURES- AND YES THEY ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CAP PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THESE INCLUDE ENHANCED MONITORING AUTHORITY FOR CALLIE C. H. TO INSURE- APPROPRIATE USE OF FUNDS. THIS INCLUDES A- INTERIM GOAL PERIOD WHERE ELIGIBLE ENTITIES UPON MEETING THOSE GOALS MAY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS- AND THIS ALSO INCLUDES ESTABLISHING REALLY SPECIFIC PROGRAM GOALS AS PART OF EVERY PROPOSAL INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVERS. THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVERS WHO ENTER INTO- IT HARD SHELLED HER PERMANENT HOUSING THE FINAL STATUS OF THE ENCAMPMENTS SITE THAT'S BEING SERVED AND ALL OF THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT ARE RICH. THANK YOU MR DERON. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE FACE ASK THE STATE WITH RELATIONS TO HOUSING IN OUR OWN HOUSE RESIDENTS BUT PARTICULARLY THE GROWTH OF ENCAMPMENTS. YOU'RE ASKING YOU'RE GOING FROM FIFTY MILLION. TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. WE ARE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED DAYS AWAY FROM CLOSING THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT YOUR REPORT ON THE FIFTY MILLION WON'T BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. HOW IS THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE. SUCH AN IMPORTANT. DECISION ON ALLOCATING PUBLIC DOLLARS WHEN WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS. YES A VERY VALID CONCERN MAKING PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO BALANCE IS HAVING GOOD DATA AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR THE PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE BUT ALSO ACTING WITH URGENCY AND SPEED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THIS ISSUE- PART OF WHAT INFORMED OUR REQUEST IT IS. FOR THIS FIRST ITERATION OF THE PROGRAM WE RECEIVED THIRTY NINE PROPOSALS REPRESENTING ALL TYPES OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE- BUT WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO FIND ONE THIRD OF THEM. AND MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO SUBMITTED PROPOSALS LET US KNOW THAT HAD MORE FUNDING AVAILABLE THEY WOULD HAVE SAID IN MULTIPLE PROPOSALS TO- PEOPLE IN MULTIPLE ENCAMPMENTS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. ALL OF THIS OF COURSE IS REFLECTED IN THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE AVAILABLE INDICATING THAT OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS AND SO WHILE CERTAINLY WE APPRECIATE THE NEED OR I'M AS MUCH WILL BUST DATA AS POSSIBLE- IN. SUPPORT OF OUR INVESTMENTS YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT WITH THE URGENCY OF THE CRISIS THAT WE. CURRENTLY ANNAPOLIS. THANK YOU. SO OUT OF THE THIRTY NINE PROPOSALS ONE THIRD WERE GRANTED. I'M JUST LOOKING AT PAGE THIRTY EIGHT FOR A MARIN COUNTY THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. WERE ALLOCATED TO ROUTE CALLS EIGHTEEN. INDIVIDUALS HOW. I'M I'M HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE COSTS AND WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THOSE EIGHTEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT COST THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SAID THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED WE ARE RIGHT NOW ARE PREPARING TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH THE DIFFERENT- GRANTEES WE RECEIVED A WIDE RANGE OF PROPOSALS- FOR A WIDE RANGE OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS PER PERSON SERVED. ADDED A SORT OF MANY OF THOSE REFLECT THE INTENT STRATEGIES THAT THE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO CARRY OUT- THE EAT LOCAL RESOURCES THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE SO IN SOME COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE OTHER PARTNERSHIPS ARE RESOURCES. THAT THEY CAN LEVERAGE THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COST PER INDIVIDUAL START- BUT OF COURSE- THE INTENT BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH DEMONSTRATE PROJECTS. I UNDERSTAND. TRAGEDIES ARE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND WHAT IS THE TRUE COST. FOR SERVING INDIVIDUALS AND YOU KNOW WHAT OF COURSE IS. OPEN HIGHEST HOUSING COSTS STATES IT IN THE NATION AND SERVING INDIVIDUALS WHO OFTEN HAVE AMONG THE MOST COMPLEX CONSTELLATION OF OVERLAPPING NEEDS AND THEN OF COURSE CORRESPONDING SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO BEAR IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS. SO I GUESS I GUESS IT MUST VERY SOME LOOKING AT THIS TWENTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION TO RE HOUSE A HUNDRED AND TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT'S A- THAT'S AT A COST OF ABOUT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND PER INDIVIDUAL. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT INDIVIDUALS FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT PLACES ARE RECEIVING. AND WHAT LIKE TO. I GUESS TO IN MANY WAYS UNDERSTAND THIS VAST COST DIFFERENCE. THE DIFFERENCES ARE OFTEN WHAT ARE SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY PLAN TO LEVERAGE SO THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE THERE'S A COMMUNITY ALREADY HAS A STRONG HOUSING PROJECT THAT THEY'RE PREPARING TO BRING. AND THE PRIMARY NEED THAT THEY HAVE IS STREET OUTREACH SERVICES AND HOUSING NAVIGATORS SO RELATIVELY LOWER COSTS NEEDS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY DISCREET. THERE MAY BE SOME INSTANCES WHERE SOME OF THOSE ON THE GROUND SERVICES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE BUT IT'S MORE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WITH REPORT WILL BE MORE COSTLY. THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE THAT A FLEXIBLE GRANT LIKE THIS IS ABLE TO FILL IN SO THAT'S PART OF WHY USED IN THE WIDER. IN THE RIGHT. COSTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED AND OF COURSE PART OF THE INTENT BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS TO DO AN EVALUATION OF THESE DIFFERENT DEMONSTRATION MODELS. TO TEST FOR ADVOCATES. SO IF I WERE TO ASK YOU WHAT WERE THE RESOURCES IF MAYBE PERHAPS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WERE OFFERED TO THESE INDIVIDUALS DO YOU HAVE THAT DATA AVAILABLE. NOT YET WE WILL HAVE THAT DATA AVAILABLE ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE PROGRAMS AND ARE ABLE TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INITIAL DATA AND REPORTING BACK. AND THAT WILL THAT WILL BE UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. APPROXIMATELY YES I'D OKAY I JUST I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU'RE ASKING YOU HAD FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE ONE THIRD OF PROPOSALS THAT WERE GRANTED I'M LOOKING AT L. A. COUNTY ALONE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION TO RE HOUSE SIXTY INDIVIDUALS THAT'SABOUT THE SIZE OF THE ENCAMPMENT THAT WE HAD IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD. IN MY DISTRICT. AND SO WHEN WE'RE ASKING FOR INFORMATION AND DATA TO BE ABLE TO FUND. PUBLIC DOLLARS AT THE TUNE OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. BEFORE JUNE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE DATA. HOW IS THE LEGISLATURE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND TO THAT. SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE SCOPE INSIGHTS THE DATA THAT WE DO PERHAPS REFLECTS THE SCOPE AND SIZE. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS- AND SO DO THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT WE RECEIVED BUT ALSO THE INFORMATION RECEIVED ABOUT THE PROPOSALS THAT WERE NOT SUBMITTED IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES. SO IT'S HARD TO FIND THAT BALANCE BETWEEN ACCOUNTABILITY AND SCALING UP THE PROGRAM TO MEET THE TO MEET THE NEED- WE ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING SOME ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES FOR THIS NEW GENERATION OF THE PROGRAM- AS I MENTIONED THAT ARE MODELED AFTER HALF SO WE WILL BE DOING ENHANCED MONITORING. AND THIS WELL THAT WOULD. THAT BILL LANGUAGE WHATEVER OUR I. C. H. WITH ADDITIONAL MEASURES SUCH AS REITS REQUIRING GRANTEES TO REDIRECT THEIR FUNDS. OR TO READ HOW TO KEEP THEIR FUNDS. OR MAKING THEM INELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE FUNDS IF IT'S PART OF OUR ENHANCED MONITORING A WE ARE NOT SEEKING A PERFORMANCE WERE NOT SEEKING APPROPRIATE USE OF FIVE. YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A ANOTHER COLLEAGUE OF YOURS ON THE LINE THAT CAN SPEAK ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. YES HI I'M STEPHANIE WILSON THE DEPUTY SECRETARY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THANK YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE A BIT ON SOME OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO. THE COUNTY THAT ARE LISTED IN THE AGENDA. OR SHOULD I SAY THE ONE THIRD OF THE THIRTY NINE PROPOSALS OVER GRANTED. MADAM CHAIR I AM I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH. THE SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED IT TO THE GRANTEES OF THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO GET BACK TO YOU ON I. BELIEVE I WAS- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL- THAT WE HAVE AS PART OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. PLEASE DO THANK YOU- WELL CERTAINLY- SO IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- WE ARE PROPOSING AS PART OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEY OFFERED THEIR APOLOGIES- I'M A STEPPING IN TODAY- FOR THEM. AT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS BEING PROPOSED FOR HOUSING. AND THIS IS SPECIFICALLY DEFINED CLINICALLY ENHANCED A BRIDGE HOUSING SETTINGS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAVE SERIOUS BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. SO MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THE FUNDING WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS AN ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT- BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE'RE OPERATING RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO EITHER PURCHASE INSTALLER OPERATE TINY HOMES OR TO PREVENT OR TO COVER OPERATING COSTS FOR. OTHER SETTINGS SPECIFICALLY ADULT RESIDENTIAL AND SENIOR CARE SETTINGS. FOR OUR POPULATION THAT HAS THE MOST CHRONIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THESE ARE THE SETTINGS IN WHICH THEY ARE MOST OFTEN TO RESIDE SUCCESSFULLY. AND IT DOES REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STAFF SUPPORT- TO PROVIDE THEM BOTH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS THAT THEY- REQUIRE- AND DEAD. WE INTEND TO WORK WITH THOSE PROVIDERS TO LEVERAGE OUR- CALLIN PROGRAM AND ACCOUNTING AND AS PART OF OUR MEDICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS- WOULD- INCREASE THE- S. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE. PROVIDED TO THIS POPULATION WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON INTEGRATING SERVICES BETWEEN PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND STD TREATMENT- SOMETHING THAT HAS BECOME VERYAPPARENT TO US. NOT ONLY IN THE TWENTY TWENTY HOMELESS WHAT TIME COUNT OF WHICH NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT GONNA FIGHT IS HAVING A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT ALSO SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME PULLING TOGETHER OF WHICH ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL IDENTIFIED NEEDS WAS A UTE. A HOUSING OPTIONS AND COMMUNITY PLACEMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS- THE GREAT HOUSING FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE. FOR THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS FUNDS WE INTEND TO MAKE AVAILABLE- STARTING AS SOON AS JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- I HATE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS OR- I HOPE THAT THAT. UPS IN LIGHT AND- I RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE REALLY REALLY HIGH NEED HIGH RISK POPULATIONS AND- WHILE THERE ARE ROVIDERS OUT THERE OFTENTIMES THEY NEED SOME ADDITIONAL PATCH FUNDING IN ORDER TO HAVE EITHER THE LOW STAFF RATIOS OR THE ADDITIONAL STAFFING OR THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES- TRANSPORTATION- FOOD SHELTER- THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO WORK WITH THIS POPULATION. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE I THINK- A LOT OF US OR SEEN THE GROWTH OF ENCAMPMENTS AND WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE HELPING THOSE IN NEED AND ALSO PROVIDING THE SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE ETCETERA. THAT FOLKS NEED SO THAT- WE CAN ENSURE THAT THERE'S- THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING RESOURCES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME APPLYING- THE NECESSARY. THE NECESSARY PRESSURES TO ENSURE THAT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE ALSO DOING THAT WORK AND WE'RE NOT SEEN A GROWTH OF ENCAMPMENTS. SO WHICH IS WHY THE QUESTION ON WHEN THAT REPORT IS GOING TO BE AVAILABLE OF ON THE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS. FROM A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ALLOCATION TO A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ALLOCATION. IS ACTUALLY QUITE CRITICAL. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WERE GOING TO MOVE ON THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR- PANEL NUMBER EIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLIANCE. SECTIONS WORKLOAD MS ROPELESS IF YOU'RE ON PLEASE BEGIN. HI THINKING MEDICARE AND MEMBERS TIME NANCY ROBUST WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. SO THE REQUEST BEFORE YOU TWO DAYS A PROPOSAL FOR ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FOUR EIGHT NEW STAFF MEMBERS THREE IN OUR DEVELOPMENT SECTION- A RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST AND FOR COMPLIANCE STAFF. CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST USER OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IN THE NATION AND ALL OF THESE POSITIONS REQUESTED WILL SUPPORT PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND PRESERVE- MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS TAX CREDITS HAVE HELPED TO DEVELOP PRODUCE OVER A TWENTY THOUSAND NEW CONSTRUCTION AFFORDABLE UNITS EACH YEAR. FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT STAFF- THOSE ARE NEEDED TO KEEP UP WITH THE INFLUX OF TAX CREDIT APPLICATIONS. THE DEMAND FAR EXCEEDS OUR AVAILABILITY AND ITS LEAVES- IT LEAVES THE PROGRAM OVER SUBSCRIBED YEAR OVER YEAR. WHERE IS HE RECEIVING APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS A YEAR. AND WE'RE ONLY ABLE TO AWARD ABOUT ONE THIRD OF. INSTANCE TAX CREDITS HAVE BECOME COMPETITIVE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ANALYSIS REQUIRED AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THOSE APPLICATIONS HAS INCREASED AS WELL. AND WE'VE HAD ABOUT A 30% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN REVIEWING SENSE ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY. DEVELOPMENT STAFFER RESPONSIBLE TO CONDUCT THREE LEVELS OF REVIEW- PROJECTS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND THOSE ARE- HIGHER S. REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE THE APPLICATION REVIEW THE READY NEXT YEAR PROCEED RUBIO AND ALSO REPLACEMENT SERVICE REVIEW THESE FEDERAL MANDATES DO NOT AFFORD US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FALL BEHIND YET WE HAVE. WE'RE DESPERATELY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STATE AGENCY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HOLDING UP AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO PERFORM THE MANDATED REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO PROCEED. I'M ANOTHER TASK THAT- DIDN'T EXIST BEFORE HAS RECENTLY SERVICE- YEARS AGO. T. CAC COMMITTEE- WE COMMITTED TO DOING A SUBSIDY LAYERING REVIEWS FOR HUD ON TAX CREDIT PROJECTS AND SINCE WE'RE THE ONLY STATE ENTITY THAT POSSESSES ITS EXPERTISE WE'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO PERFORM THIS TASK ON NON TAX CREDIT PROJECTS RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING THESE REQUESTS AND ANTICIPATE INCREASING NUMBER OF THOSE. AS DEVELOPERS ARE USING OTHER FUNDS THAT HAVE THIS REQUIREMENT WHEN THEY'RE UNABLE TO OBTAIN TAX CREDITS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED A NEW TASK THROUGH THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION TO IMPLEMENT A NEW PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE TAX CREDITS FOR THE REHABILITATION OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS. WERE ALSO- PRESENTLY UTILIZING EXISTING STAFF TO DEVELOP AND RUN THAT PROGRAM TAKING THEM AWAY FROM THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS. I DELETE MUCH OF THIS WORK WOULD BE DONE BY A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANALYSTS WHICH IS ONE OF THE POSITIONS THAT WERE REQUESTING TODAY. IN ADDITION TO THE RT EIGHT IT ALSO COORDINATES THE MULTIPLE NUMBER OF. THE REPORT. WITHIN OUR COMPLIANCE DIVISION- ARE A COMPRESSIONAL MANDATE REQUIRES THAT T. CAP BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT EVERY TAX CREDIT PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA IS MONITORED EVERY THREE YEARS FOR A TERM OF FIFTY FIVE YEARS. THIS MODERN MONITORING MUST BE CONDUCTED ON SITE AND INCLUDES BOTH PHYSICAL INSPECTION AND FILE REVIEWS. MCCARTY CATHCART FOLIO CONSIST OF ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND PROJECTS AND WITH THE INCREASED NUMBER OF. PROJECTS GROWING BY APPROXIMATELY. TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED PROJECTS ANNUALLY T. CAP IS NOT ADEQUATELY STAFF TO MEET THE FEDERALLY MANDATED MODERN. YEAH IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE IRS. HI QUITE A COMPLIANCE MONITORING REGULATION THAT GREATLY INCREASED OUR COMPLIANCE WORKLOAD THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE THIS THAT STATES CONDUCT PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS OF EVERY PROPERTY EVERY THREE YEARS FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS WITH NEW REQUIREMENTS TO IMPOSE MORE RIGOROUS PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF THE PROPERTY INSPECTIONS MUST INCLUDE A PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF ALL BUILDING EXTERIORS AND COMMON PLACES AND BASED ON THE NUMBER OF EXISTING UNITS ON THE INCREASING PROJECTS. UP WE MIGHT BE REQUIRED TO INSPECT AS MANY AS. SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROJECTS THAT YEAR. IN ADDITION COMPLIANCE CONDUCTS HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF TRAINING THOUSANDS OF STAKEHOLDERS EVERY YEAR ANY ANSWERS OVER THREE THOUSAND PHONE CALLS AND EMAILS FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND TENANTS. AND THEN THEY CONDUCT RESEARCH AND FOLLOW UP WITH TENANT COMPLAINTS REDUCE THE MORE THESE IMPORTANT TASKS INCREASE AND WE MUST INCREASE OUR STAFF. AND PROPORTIONATELY TO THE RATE AT THE INCREASING PROJECTS. I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT SINCE THE CITY WAS WRITTEN AND SUBMITTED TO YOU THE NINETEEN VACANCIES LISTED ARE NOW ONLY A LOT WE'VE HIRED NINE NEW STAFF AND WE LOST ONE THAT'S THE- END OF LAST YEAR AND THEN FIVE OF THE ELEVEN STAFF ARE IN THE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT. THREE YEAR IN THE DEVELOPMENT UNIT AND THE OTHERS ARE ADMINISTRATIVE. THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAD HIRING THOSE STAFF WAS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC NINETEEN AT COBIT NINETEEN HAD THAT MAKE. AND THE FACT THAT THE COMPLAINTS TO THE STATEMENT HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS IMBEDDED WITHIN THEM. AND DOES THIS HINDERED A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR APPLYING FOR THE POSITIONS AND THEN WHEN DISCOVERING THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH TRAVEL INVOLVED NOT WANTING TO TAKE THOSE POSITIONS- WE JUST RECENTLY LEAVE SUCCESSFULLY HIRED FIVE. NEW STAFF MEMBERS- FOR COMPLIANCE- POSITION SO WE'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE- TRAVELING RIGHT NOW CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU CAN YOU PERCENT ON ISSUE NUMBER TEN PLEASE AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE ALLEY- IN FINANCE FOR BOTH AND THEN COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS AND I ASK THAT YOU PLEASE.

YES MADAM CHAIR I AM HERE CAN YOU HEAR AND SEE ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU THE VIDEO MAY BE A LITTLE BIT ON DELAY PLEASE BEGIN. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND KATIE SALEN SKATE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALPERS RETIREMENT SAVINGS BOARD. AND BY WAY OF REMINDER CAL SAVERS IS FOR PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS WHO LACK ACCESS TO A RETIREMENT PLAN AT WORK. IT'S VOLUNTARY FOR EMPLOYEES BUT IS OPERATED ON AN AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT OPT OUT BASIS. AND THE LAWS DOUBLES AND HEALTHY BIRTH COMES OF THE REQUIREMENT IN PLAYERS THAT HAVE AT LEAST FIVE EMPLOYEES AND DO NOT OFFER A RETIREMENT PLAN MUST FACILITATE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE WORSE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEESOR FACE PENALTIES. AT THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS SIX MILLION DOLLARS AN ADDITIONAL LOAN AUTHORITY AND THREE NEW POSITIONS TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE CUSTOMER'S PROGRAM FOR APPROXIMATELY THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS AND ALSO SPENT ABOUT TWO OR THREE MINUTES TO PROVIDE YOU AN UPDATE. EARLY PROGRESS TO DATE I CALPERS LAUNCHED AND BEGAN ITS THREE YEAR ROLLOUT IN JULY TWENTY NINETEEN JUST ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC AND WITHIN THIS THREE YEAR ROLLOUT WE HAVE THREE. STAGGERED IMPLANT EMPLOYER COMPLIANCE DEADLINES WHICH VARY BY SIZE AND WE ARE APPROACHING RIGHT NOW THE FINAL EMPLOYER COMPLIANCE DEADLINE IN FOUR MONTHS ON JUNE THIRTIETH FOR THE SMALLEST EMPLOYERS. AND VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW YOUR VERY RELEVANT FOR THIS AT B. C. P. AS THAT THE FINAL DEADLINE APPLIES TO MORE THAN EMPLOYER VOLUME OF TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND EMPLOYERS AND THAT MEANS THAT WE ARE FACING A MASSIVE SURGE OF EMPLOYERS RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW ALL OF THOSE WHOM HAVE QUESTIONS AND REQUIRE SUPPORT AND THE MAJORITY OF THAT SUPPORT IS PROVIDED BY OUR CURRENT CONTRACTED PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR- BUT A PORTION OF THE BILL YOU HAVE TO COME TO OUR STAFF A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT AND- WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS ABOUT HOW- HOW THOSE CASES AND REFERRALS BREAKDOWN. AND TO DATE WE HAV THIRTY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYERS HAVE REGISTERED ACROSS THE STATE ALMOST ONE THIRD OF COMMON. JOINED IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS AND THAT LEAVES US WITH ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYERS. OF THE REMAIN FIRST ENGAGED WHAT THIS YEAR. AND REGARDING FAVOR STUFF WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR PROCESS RATE OF. PERCENT AMONG ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE IS AND THAT'S REMAINED. CONSISTENT SINCE OUR LAUNCH AND IF IT GETS REALLY MEANINGFUL WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT THE MEDIAN INCOME OF THE POPULATION IS LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND. DOLLARS PER YEAR AND THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY. THAT AN EMPLOYER MATCH OR GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTIONS OTHERS MAKING THAT WORK- IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS THIRTY SIX THOUSAND FUNDED ACCOUNTS HOLDING ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS AS OF RIGHT NOW. AND SAVERS ARE CONTRIBUTING ABOUT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH- I WILL NOTE AT THIS STATISTIC IT IS IT'S VERY NOTABLE THAT MORE THAN 38% OF OUR SABERS RIGHT NOW HAVE CONTRIBUTED VM. MORE THAN ONE JOB WHICH REFLECTS THAT THE PORTABILITY OF THE PROGRAM IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IS WORKING AS DESIGNED- AN UPDATE ON ENFORCEMENT QUICKLY WE DELAYED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PENALTIES FOR EMPLOYERS NONCOMPLIANCE DURING THE FIRST. NEARLY TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC BUT I'VE RECENTLY BEGUN. VERY QUICKLY I HAD TO IMPOSE PENALTIES FOR THE LARGEST NON COMPLIANT EMPLOYERS WHOSE DEADLINE WAS SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IN ITSELF WAS EXTENDED FROM JUNE TO CO THAT I THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS OUR PARTNER IN ACHIEVING THOSE PENALTIES AND- YOU KNOW IT ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINK THANKS TO PROJECT. TO PROJECT HERE IS THE EFFECTIVE OF ENFORCEMENT THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN BUT WE REALLY ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT IT WILL HELP US BRING THESE EMPLOYERS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS. I HAVE THE ACCESS TO CAL SAVERS THAT A LOT PROMISES AND YOU KNOW IN CLOSING ON TO SAY THAT WE ARE GROWING VERY QUICKLY AND THIS ADDITIONAL LOAN AUTHORITY I WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS THROUGH THE ROLL OUT AND THAT REALLY GROWTH YEARS. WHILE WE BUILD TOWARDS SELF SUFFICIENCY AND MEDICARE THAT'S ALL I HAVE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK. YOU SO MUCH WILL GO TO THE L. A- PLEASE.

MISTER NAZARIAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION I JUST WANTED TO- YOU RATTLED OFF A FEW NUMBERS AND I ONLY CAUGHT THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION SO DO YOU MIND ALSO GOING GOING BACK AGAIN AND SAY HOW MANY PARTICIPANTS YOU HAVE AND WHAT THE AVERAGE SAVINGS IS- AND IT IS THAT I GET THE RIGHT NUMBER OF THE TOTAL ASSETS BEING AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION. YES SIR HAPPY TO GO BACK IT IS A TOTAL ASSETS ARE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION. AND THAT IS ACROSS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND FUNDED ACCOUNTS. ARE AVERAGE FUNDED ACCOUNT BALANCE IS SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS RIGHT NOW. I WILL NOTE THAT THAT AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHILE WE'RE GROWING AND SURGING THE DENOMINATOR THERE ADD GROWS SO THAT BRINGS HER BRINGS DOWN OUR AVERAGE WE DO HAVE- AT SEVERAL YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR MORE MATURE ACCOUNTS HAVE. OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ACCOUNT BALANCE AND SO THERE'S A REAL DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE ACROSS SIZE DEPENDING ON THE MATURITY OF THE ACCOUNT. N. HOW MANY OF THESE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ACCOUNTS ARE IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD- I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT AND I'M NOT. THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET BUT WE CAN WE CAN SEE WHAT WE CAN GET FOR YOU. OKAY AND WHERE DO YOU SEE THE WEIGHT OF THESE ACCOUNTS COMING IN. WHICH COUNTIES ARE THE HIGHEST PRODUCING. AND BY THE WAY YOU YOU CAN GET BACK TO ME ABOUT THESE LATER ON I'D LOVE TO JUST TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE I WOULD I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR PROJECTED INCREASES IS WHAT THE GOALS THE BENCHMARKS ARE OF WHAT NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS YOU WANT TO HAVE OPENED- YEAR OVER YEAR AND WHERE DO YOU NEED TO BE SO I'D LIKE TO. DELVE INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. YES THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS THAT I WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THE VERY FAIR. ON THE COUNTY DISTRIBUTION IT ROUGHLY REFLECTS OUR POPULATION. SO WE ARE NOT SEEING ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR SURPRISING ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS ACROSS. ALL THE COUNTY IS IT REALLY JUST REFLECTS A POPULATION AT THIS POINT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT AS INDUSTRY. OBVIOUSLY- WORKERS WHO LACK ACCESS TO A WORK A WORKPLACE BASED RETIREMENT PLAN ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN RETAIL RESTAURANT HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS AGRICULTURE- THOSE ARE SOME OF HER. WASTE MANAGEMENT THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR BIGGEST- INDUSTRIES. AND ADAM WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT IT ENGAGE FURTHER ON ALL OF THIS- I CAN SEND YOU OUR- ANNUAL REPORT FROM LAST YEAR WHICH- ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS. BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR- HE MENTIONED THAT YOU'RE- INTERESTED IN AND PROJECTIONS. IT'S AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BOTH EMPLOYER BEHAVIOR AND THEIR COMPLIANCE- A LOT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE HANDS ON THE EFFECT OF THIS PENALTY IMPOSITION. AND UNTIL WE GET THE EMPLOYER'S COMPLAINT WE HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE THAT TO THE WORK FORCE SO. THAT'S ONE OF THE DIFFICULT THINGS TO PROJECT ALSO DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT HUMAN BEHAVIOR WILL DEAL WITH THAT YOU KNOW EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOR WILL BE. BUT IN IN TERMS I HAVE BASED ON. AND A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE IT IT'S IF WE LOOK FIVE YEARS AFTER FROM RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT- I'M SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF ACCOUNTS. OF COURSE. THAT'S BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAN CHANGE AND- I KNOW IT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF MY MOUTH IT'S WRONG BUT ON THE BUT THAT'S- SORT OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT AND THAT'S A BIG RANGE. AND I'M FAVORITE ASSETS WE'RE LOOKING AT AGAIN FIVE YEARS OUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND A HALF BILLION AND FIVE BILLION IN ASSETS. OBVIOUSLY ON THE ASSET SIDE IT DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF THE WORK FORCE TO PEOPLE ROLL THEIR FUNDS OUT IF THEY- GET A NEW JOB ALSO OBVIOUSLY INVESTMENT RETURNS. BUT I'M AS OF RIGHT NOW THAT'S ARE ARE. THOSE ARE PATH THAT'S A PREDICTIONS ON WHERE WILL BE OUTSIDE YOURSELF. THANKS TO REQUEST TWO MORE QUICK QUESTIONS INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT YOU'RE SEEING A- PREVALENT OR INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT ARE. USING GREATER ACTIVITY. IN OPENING THESE ACCOUNTS OR. OR NOT NECESSARILY. YES S. I THINK. RETAIL REST- HOTEL. AGRICULTURE WASTE MANAGEMENT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE- MOST HEAVILY REPRESENTED AND THAT REALLY REFLECTS- THE LACK OF ACCESS TO A WORKPLACE BIGGEST PLAN INDIA PERCENTAGE BREAKDOWNS FOR THESE.

THAT DIRECT MAIL THAT WE SEND TO EMPLOYERS AND FAVORS- DIGITAL- DIGITAL MARKETING WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER- AND THAT'S ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT THEY'VE COMMITTED WHAT THAT DOES NOT COVER IS NON DIGITAL ADVERTISING WHICH IS PART OF THIS IBCP REQUEST WERE INTERESTED IN- OPERATING AN EXPERIMENT ON OUT OF HOME ADVERTISING AND BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS. TRANSIT ADS BUS STOPS OUTSIDE THE BUSES- ADVERTISING ON THE SIDES OF BUILDINGS- SO THAT WE CAN RAISE AWARENESS BECAUSE YOU KNOW DOING TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT TO YOU KNOW THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYERS AND TO THEIR MILLIONS OF WORKERS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF HEALTHCARE IS. REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO FAR HAS BEEN THROUGH OUR PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR ON THEIR AT THEIR COMMITMENT TO MARKETING WE HAVE A COUPLE OF STAFF WHO ARE DEDICATED TO OUR REGION EDUCATION HERE.
