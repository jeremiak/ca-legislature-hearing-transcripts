CALIFORNIA LAW THAT HAMSTRING.

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:25.069
IMPORTANT NETWORK OF PUBLICLY

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:28.139
SUBSIDIZED INNER CITY BUSES FROM

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.207
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE -- WRITERS

ALLOCATED EACH YEAR TO REGIONAL

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:38.916
CALIFORNIA'S INTERCITY.

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.618
PASSENGER RAIL CORRIDORS.

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:41.485
I THESE QUARTERS ARE BOLSTERED

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:42.553
THROUGH A LARGE NETWORK OF

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.488
THROUGH A PROCESS THAT BRANCH

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:45.990
OUT FROM RAIL STATIONS TO

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.324
CONNECT WRITERS TO OVERTURN A

00:38:47.391 --> 00:38:48.726
FIFTY TOWNS AND COMMUNITIES.

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:50.528
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND EVEN

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:51.529
INTO NEVADA.

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:53.230
THESE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE TRAVEL

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:54.799
OPTIONS ARE NOT SIMPLY BETWEEN

00:38:54.865 --> 00:38:56.467
URBAN HUBS BUT OFTENTIMES THEY

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.235
SERVE OUT OF THE WAY MORE RURAL

00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:58.869
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NO OTHER

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:00.271
FORM.

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:02.006
OF OF OF INNER CITY PUBLIC

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:03.908
TRANSPORTATION.

00:39:03.974 --> 00:39:05.209
NOW HERE'S WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:07.344
REAL THROUGH A BUS IS OFTEN

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:08.813
OPERATE FAR BELOW CAPACITY.

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.214
AND PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:11.949
OUR CURRENT LAW.

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.417
EVEN IF THE BUS STARTS FROM A

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:14.752
ROUTE FROM A TRAIN STATION WITH

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.287
ALL THAT SEAT OCCUPIED -- AS IT

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:17.688
TRAVELS FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:18.889
ANOTHER OFTEN GETS EMPTIER

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:22.226
EMPTIER MORE MORE EMPTY AS THE

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.461
ROOT MOVES A LOT.

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:24.161
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE

00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:25.796
CURRENT LAW DOESN'T ALLOW THAT

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:28.099
BUSES RUNNING ANYWAY. TO PICK UP

00:39:28.165 --> 00:39:29.667
NEW PASSENGERS ALONG THE WAY.

00:39:29.734 --> 00:39:31.802
SO WHAT THIS LAW DOES IS IT

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:32.903
REMOVES A STEEP IN WHICH

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.472
PROHIBITS RAIL THROUGH A BUSES

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.207
FROM SELLING TICKETS. TO ANY

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.608
PASSENGER UNLESS HE OR SHE AYE

00:39:37.675 --> 00:39:38.809
THE ROAD ON A TRAIN BEFORE

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:40.778
CATCHING THAT BUS OR IS WRITING

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.513
ON THAT BUS TO CATCH A TRAIN.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.547
IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR FOR

00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:44.682
GOVERNMENT TO BLOCK UBER A LIFT

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:45.649
FROM OFFERING COMPETITIVELY

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:46.951
PRICED RIGHTS TO PASSENGERS THAT

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:48.552
MIGHT OTHERWISE CHOOSE. TO WRITE

00:39:48.619 --> 00:39:50.554
A CITY BUS AND IT'S NOT FAIR FOR

00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:52.022
CALIFORNIA STATUTE TO BLOCK

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:53.557
PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED BY SERVICES

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:55.259
FROM COMPETING AGAINST PRIVATE

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.193
COMPANIES.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:57.361
ARE THIS MEASURE SPURS GREATER

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:58.929
COMPETITIONIN THE OPEN MARKET

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.397
PLACE TO HELP GOVERNMENTS SPEND.

00:40:00.464 --> 00:40:01.665
TAXPAYER MONEY MORE EFFICIENTLY

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:02.967
IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF THE

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.537
MEANS CAME TO MY ATTENTION WHEN

I ONCE -- WAS WAS ON THAT WAS ON

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.541

ABLE TO RIDE THE BUS THAT WAS.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.580
RUNNING ANYWAY ON AMTRAK AND

00:40:16.647 --> 00:40:20.851
IT'S A SENSIBLE BILL IT PASSED

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:23.354
UNANIMOUSLY I'VE GOT STRIVE.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:23.921
THIS BILL IS A CANDID FOR

FACILITIES.

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:13.877
THE FATHER OF THE BOY THAT THIS

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:16.313
BILL IS KNOWN.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.781
FOR RYAN'S LAW TESTIFIED BEFORE

00:45:17.848 --> 00:45:19.616
OUR COMMITTEE.

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:21.552
AND HE SPOKE FROM THE HEART.

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:24.354
HIS SON RYAN WAS DYING OF CANCER

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.522
IN ENORMOUS PAIN AND SADLY AT

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:26.690
SUCH.

00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:29.960
A VERY YOUNG AGE.

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.228
BUT AS WE SEE OFTEN WHEN PEOPLE

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.230
GET.

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.666
END STAGE CARE THROUGH HOSPICES

00:45:35.732 --> 00:45:38.535
OR IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.304
THE DOCTORS OFTEN THROW

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.905
NARCOTICS ADAM THEY THROW FENTON

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:42.973
ALLOWED A MORPHINE ADAM DILAUDID

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:43.807
IN THE PROBLEM.

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:46.110
IS THAT YOU ARE MITIGATING THEIR

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:48.145
PAIN BUT IN THE LAST FEW DAYS --

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.713
LAST FEW HOURS OF THEIR LIFE ON

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.281
THIS PLANET.

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:52.516
YOUR RENDERING THEM TO BE

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.351
UNCONSCIOUS.

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.886
AND MANY OF THESE TERMINALLY ILL

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:57.721
PATIENTS INCLUDING RYAN WANTED

00:45:57.788 --> 00:45:59.189
TO BE ALERT AND AWAKE.

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.458
AND SPENT EVERY PRECIOUS MOMENT

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:03.427
THEY HAVE LEFT ON THIS PLANET.

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:05.863
WITH HIS LOVE ONES.

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:06.930
BUT THE ONLY WAY THAT HE COULD

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:08.966
DO THAT.

00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:09.833
BECAUSE HE DISCOVERED THE

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:10.634
CANNABIS COULD TAKE HIS PAIN

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:12.269
AWAY AND WOULD NOT BECOME

00:46:12.336 --> 00:46:13.637
UNCONSCIOUS.

00:46:13.704 --> 00:46:16.673
WAS TO CONTINUE THE UTILIZATION.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.841
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HE

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:18.809
LEGALLY COULDN'T DO HERE IN THE

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.144
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.112
OUR CURRENT LAWS.

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:22.679
YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:24.148
ABOUT.

00:46:24.214 --> 00:46:26.016
MEDICAL MARIJUANA NOW FOR OVER A

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.384
DECADE AND WE'VE LEARNED

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.485
THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE THAT

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:30.420
THERE ARE MANY EFFICACIES MANY

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:32.089
WONDERFUL USES FOR MEDICAL

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.957
CANNABIS THAT.

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:34.525
WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.560
BECAUSE FRANKLY BECAUSE WAS A

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:37.895
SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WE DID ALLOW

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.930
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS STANFORD

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:42.466
UCLA THAT WE RECOGNIZE TODAY UC

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:43.867
DAVIS TO STUDY.

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:45.369
THE MEDICAL EFFICACY OF OF

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.271
CANNABIS BUT OTHER COUNTRIES

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.572
HAVEN'T SHOWN.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:53.644
IT TO BE A VERY -- GOOD DRUG.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:55.112
AS A PHARMACIST I CAN TELL YOU

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:57.147
THE CANNABIS HAS A POTENTIAL OF

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.682
HELPING PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR PAIN.

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.118
AND WITHOUT MANY OF THE NEGATIVE

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:02.886
SIDE EFFECTS OF OPIOIDS.

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:03.921
I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:05.389
THAT A DYING PATIENT SHOULD

00:47:05.455 --> 00:47:09.459
NEVER LIVE HIS OR HER LAST DAYS.

00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:10.928
IN NEEDLESS PAIN OR AGONY.

00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:12.629
THE FTA ALREADY APPROVED CERTAIN

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:14.231
CANNABIS DERIVATIVES LIKE SEE

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:15.699
MEDIAN ERIN ALL.

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:17.234
BECAUSE OF THEIR PROVEN

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:18.635
MEDICINAL VALUE.

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:20.871
AND WHILE THE FDA HAS ADMITTED

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:22.439
CERTAIN VALUE TO CANNABIS

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:24.708
DERIVATIVES ITS INSISTENCE ON

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.076
CALLING THIS A CLASS ONE DRUG IS

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.878
MEANT A SEVERE LACK OF CLINICAL

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:28.779
STUDIES.

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:30.547
ON THE BENEFITS OF DYING

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.616
PATIENTS WHO NEEDLESSLY SUFFER

00:47:32.683 --> 00:47:34.218
AND SHOULDN'T HAVE.

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:35.185
TO AND WHILE THE FTA AS

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:36.620
CONTINUES PRACTICE OF TREATING

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.989
MARIJUANA THE SAME AS HER WHEN

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.490
THIRTY THREE STATES NOW.

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.793
EMBRACE MEDICAL CANNABIS AS WE

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:43.961
HAVE LED THE WAY.

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:44.661
NOT BECAUSE STUDIES DONE HERE IN

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:46.363
THE US BUT BECAUSE OF STUDIES

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.598
CONDUCTED TO COUNTRIES LIKE

00:47:47.664 --> 00:47:50.234
ISRAEL THE PROOF THAT MARIJUANA --

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.202
AND ITS SECOND GENER IS TRULY

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:55.005
HAVE MEDICINAL VALUE.

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.206
WE CERTAINLY KNOW AGAIN THAT

00:47:56.273 --> 00:47:57.474
MARINOL VENUES FOR AIDS TO STOP

00:47:57.541 --> 00:47:58.709
THE WASTING SYNDROME AND

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.677
CHEMOTHERAPY PATIENTS SO THEY

00:48:00.744 --> 00:48:01.712
CAN KEEP FOOD DOWN.

00:48:01.778 --> 00:48:03.146
AFTER THEY GET SOME OF THESE

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:05.649
TOXIC DRUGS OR POSTAL POISONOUS

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:06.583
TO THEIR BODY.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.851
IF CANNABIS IS THE MEDICATION

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:08.619
ALLOWS A PERSON TO BETTER COPE

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:09.853
WITH PAIN AND SUFFERING THEIR

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.455
FINAL HOURS AND WE SHOULD STAND

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:13.090
BEHIND THEM.

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:14.024
AND ALLEVIATE SOME OF THAT

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:15.993
SUFFERING NO ONE SHOULD BE

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.527
FORCED TO INDOOR PAIN.

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:18.795
SB THREE OH FIVE WILL GET DYING

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.564
PATIENTS A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.499
AND THEIR NUMBER TODAY'S.

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.167
AND FOR MANY HOPE.

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.702
WHAT HAPPENED A RHYME BARTEL

01:38:54.028 --> 01:38:55.963
IS THAT.

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:58.732
WE HAVE A HOMELESS PROBLEM.

01:38:58.799 --> 01:38:59.233
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:38:59.300 --> 01:38:59.900
CALIFORNIA.

01:38:59.967 --> 01:39:01.635
PROBABLY EXCEEDS OVER A HUNDRED

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:03.504
EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:05.639
IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO ANY ONE OF

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:07.408
OUR DISTRICTS WE ALL HAVE IT.

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:08.609
CERTAINLY IT'S MORE PREVALENT

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:11.278
AND MORE THE URBAN AREAS.

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:11.779
AND ONE OF THE REASONS

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.147
CONTRIBUTING OR HOMELESS CRISIS

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:14.515
IS WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF

01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:16.650
HOUSING ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

01:39:16.717 --> 01:39:17.985
AND IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO DO

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:18.919
SOMETHING ABOUT LOWERING THE

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:20.754
PRICE OF A HOUSING WE NEED TO

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.423
FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF WHAT SB

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:25.693
SIR SEVEN FORTY FOUR IS DOING.

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:26.527
WE NEED EITHER STREAMLINED

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.362
SYKORA.

01:39:28.429 --> 01:39:30.130
OR ELIMINATE SEEK BUFFER SOME OF

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:31.532
THESE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WILL

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.467
ALLOW FOR A LOWERING OF THE

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:34.468
COSTA HOUSING IT.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:36.070
IN GETTING SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:37.237
THAT.

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:38.539
HAVE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS WHILE

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:39.840
THEY GO TO SCHOOL HARD TO

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:40.708
BELIEVE WE HAVE TO VOTE ON THE

01:39:40.774 --> 01:39:41.742
MEASURE LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.377
JUST.

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:44.745
VOTING TO PUT HIM IN THEIR CARS

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:45.479
WHETHER GOING TO SCHOOL HOW

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:46.980

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:51.618
AND INTO HOMES.

01:39:51.685 --> 01:39:52.920
I THINK INDIAN ACTION BY THIS

01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.555
LEGISLATURE IN THE FUTURE AND

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:56.690
NOT STREAMLINING SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:58.225
REALLY ADDRESSING.

01:39:58.292 --> 01:39:59.193
THE HOMELESS PROBLEM WE HAVE IN

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.361
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.395
TO CREATE MORE MENTALLY ILL

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:02.763
PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING FORCE ON

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.064
THE TREETS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:40:04.131 --> 01:40:05.833

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:31.225
I WASN'T INTENDING TO RISE BUT

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:33.594
IT'S BEEN A FOR YEARS.

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.763
THE SEQUEL IS THE ENEMY OF

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:37.297
EVERYTHING GOOD IN THE STATE AND

01:40:37.364 --> 01:40:38.599
I WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT

01:40:38.665 --> 01:40:40.267
SHE WAS THE REASON CALIFORNIA

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:42.669
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MIAMI BEACH.

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:44.438
AND IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:45.339
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:46.974
OF THE SICK WAS NOT THE PROBLEM

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.809
HERE.

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.210
THE PROBLEM IS LOCAL LAND USE

01:40:50.277 --> 01:40:51.945
DECISIONS THE PROBLEM IS NIMBY

01:40:52.012 --> 01:40:53.747
ISM THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE THREE

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.916
AND A HALF MILLION UNITS SHORT.

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.751
AND THERE IS NO WAY WE ARE GOING

01:40:57.818 --> 01:40:59.186
TO BUILD OURSELVES OUT OF THIS

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:00.754
PROBLEM.

01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:02.456
AND PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT

01:41:02.523 --> 01:41:04.525
LANDLORDS BECAUSE OF THE SUPPLY

01:41:04.591 --> 01:41:06.193
AND DEMAND NATURE OF HOUSING GET

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.262
TO CHARGE WHAT THEY WANT.

01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:09.863
THE PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:11.665
WE HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.267
THINGS LIKE RENT CONTROL.

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:16.904
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS VERY

01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:19.573
EASY TO SORT OF PASTE OVER WITH

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.376
ALL THE SLOGANS THAT SEEK WAS

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:24.044
THE ENEMY WE'VE XPEDITED SEQUEL

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:25.546
IN MANY INSTANCES WE'VE

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:28.048
STREAMLINED IT IN MANY INSTANCES.

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:29.550
I'VE DONE LEGISLATION THAT

01:41:29.616 --> 01:41:31.552
EXPEDITES THE PROCESS BECAUSE

01:41:31.618 --> 01:41:33.253
PART OF THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:35.422
THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO HAVE A

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.925
SECRET MATTER HEARD THIS IS NOT

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:39.860
THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEM THOUGH

01:41:39.927 --> 01:41:42.196
AND IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:44.198
EXPEDITED REVIEWS AND YOU'LL

01:41:44.264 --> 01:41:46.133
NOTE THAT THE OPPOSITION HERE.

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.634
COMES FROM BOTH THE SIERRA CLUB

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.269
AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:53.140
WE HAVE PRIORITIES IN THE STATE

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:54.408
WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD.

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.844
THE COURTS THIS LEGISLATURE TO

01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:58.345
PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE OUR

01:41:58.412 --> 01:41:59.346
SENIORS.

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:00.814
HAVE PRIORITY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.950
CASES BEING FILED WE ALSO HAVE A

01:42:03.016 --> 01:42:04.718
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.253
HAS PRIORITIES BECAUSE OF THE

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.288
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. TO A

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:10.924
SPEEDY TRIAL WE'VE HAD INSTANCES

01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:12.659
WHERE WE GIVE DISABILITY RIGHTS

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:15.529
FOLKS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE

01:42:15.596 --> 01:42:17.064
HAVE SET THAT IS A PRIORITY.

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.799
WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE CIRCUMSPECT

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:20.968
ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT THIS AND

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:22.102
INSTEAD OF THROWING DOWN THE

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.403
GAUNTLET THAT SICK WAS THE

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.805
REASON THAT WE ARE IN THE MASS

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:25.672
WE ARE.

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:27.608
I THINK WE IF WE ARE TRULY GOING

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:28.909
TO ADDRESS THE SERIOUS HOUSING

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.178
PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THE STATE WE%

01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:32.579
NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE REAL

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:34.548
CULPRITS ARE.

01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:36.917
AND I AGAIN OF IT NOT GOING TO

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.385
SUPPORT THIS MEASURE BECAUSE

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:39.920
THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER WE DO

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:42.322
HAVE DESPERATE NEED FOR PEOPLE

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:43.891
WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:44.925
ELSEWHERE.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.027
BUT TRYING TO EVISCERATES SYKORA

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:50.330
IS NOT THE SOLUTION WITHOUT AYE

CASES TO EXPEDITE MATTERS WE DO

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.415

01:43:08.482 --> 01:43:09.850
DO IN A VARIETY OF OTHER.

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:12.286

ON THIS BILL.

01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:24.164

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:26.199
TO TELL US WHAT NEEDS TO BE

01:43:26.266 --> 01:43:27.734
EXPEDITED AND NOT EXPEDITED.

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.102
THEIR JOB IS TO TELL US WHAT

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:30.771
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GET THE

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:32.339
JOB DONE AND I LET THEM KNOW

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE -- WITHOUT

I THINK THE COMMENTS THAT WE

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:35.228
HEARD TODAY NORMALLY -- I THINK

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.763
YOU'RE RATIONALLY INFLAME THE

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:38.265
PASSIONS.

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:41.334
BUT SEE WAT IS -- A A SERIES OF

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:43.670
PROTECTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO

01:45:43.737 --> 01:45:44.938
PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT IN OUR

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:47.307
COMMUNITY IN MY EXPERIENCE

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:48.775
ESPECIALLY THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:49.910
FORMALLY AS A CITY COUNCIL

01:45:49.976 --> 01:45:51.211
MEMBER THAN ON THE BOARD OF

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:53.046
SUPERVISORS HAVING LAND USE

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:55.749
AUTHORITY I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:57.384
EXACTLY HOW SEEK WORK IS NO

01:45:57.451 --> 01:46:01.088
LONGER USED MOSTLY AS A SHIELD

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:01.988
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:03.657
BUT INSTEAD AS AN EXTRACTION

01:46:03.724 --> 01:46:05.192
TOOL AS A SORT.

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:06.493
AND I THINK IF WE'RE SERIOUS

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.229
ABOUT CHANGING OUR HOUSING STOCK

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.297
IN THIS STATE.

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:12.132
GETTING OUT OF THE DEFICIT THAT

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:13.767
WERE IN IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND

01:46:13.834 --> 01:46:15.102
AFFORDABILITY.

01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:18.138
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ON SOME

01:46:18.205 --> 01:46:20.440
OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS IN ONE

01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:21.808
OF THOSE IMPEDIMENTS IN MY

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:23.510
OPINION I THINK FACTUALLY.

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:26.613
IS THAT SEEK WERE CREATES.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:28.582
ARE ARE A SERIES OF ROAD BLOCKS

01:46:28.648 --> 01:46:30.183
THAT HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:32.319
BE MISUSED BY ADVOCATES FOR

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:34.488
OTHER THAN ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS.

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:36.523
SO I WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT AND

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.625
ENCOURAGE OTHERS IN THIS ROOM TO

01:46:38.692 --> 01:46:40.293
SUPPORT -- THIS -- PROPOSED

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.462
LEGISLATION -- BECAUSE WE CAN'T

01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:44.131
CONTINUE TO TO KEEP OUR HEAD IN

01:46:44.197 --> 01:46:46.166
THE SAND IF WE BELIEVE THAT

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:48.335
CALIFORNIA NEEDS A HOUSING STOCK.

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:49.636
AND WE NEED TO MAKE HOUSING MORE

01:46:49.703 --> 01:46:51.371
AFFORDABLE WE NEED TO INCREASE

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.539
THE SUPPLY.

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:54.341
AND WE WILL NEVER BE SERIOUS

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:56.009
ABOUT ENDING THIS THIS CHALLENGE

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:59.112
UNLESS WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE IN --

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:02.282

CURRENT STATE I WOULD ENCOURAGE

BUSINESS AND WITH ALL DUE

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:29.376
RESPECT.

01:47:29.442 --> 01:47:30.110
WHEN YOU TELL THE COURTS THE

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:31.645
ONLY A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:47:31.711 --> 01:47:33.180
DAYS WITHIN WHICH TO RULE ON

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:35.415
SOMETHING -- I DON'T BELIEVE

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:37.217
THAT IS OUR JURISDICTION -- TO

01:47:37.284 --> 01:47:38.418
TELL THE COURTS HOW TO DO THEIR

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:39.719
BUSINESS.

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:42.489
IS AND I THINK UNCONSTITUTIONAL

01:47:42.556 --> 01:47:45.392
A DIRECTIVE TO THE BUT I WILL

01:47:45.458 --> 01:47:46.426
SAY THIS.

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:48.628
IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT

01:47:48.695 --> 01:47:49.629
THE PROBLEM IS AND ARE JUST

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:51.698
TRYING.

01:47:51.765 --> 01:47:53.233
TO CREATE MORE DEVELOPMENT

01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:56.369
BECAUSE DEVELOPERS LIKE TO BUILD.

01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:57.704
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE

01:47:57.771 --> 01:48:00.273
DONE WITH THE SEQUEL REVIEW.

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.842
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:03.710
PERCENTAGE OF CASES THAT ARE

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:05.111
RESOLVED?

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:07.380
PRIOR TO GOING TO LITIGATION OUR

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:09.482
E. WHEN YOU FILE A SEQUEL CLAIM

01:48:09.549 --> 01:48:10.717
IT'S THERE'S A REQUIREMENT OF

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:13.420
MEDIATION. EIGHTY FIVE OR 90% OF

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:15.088
THOSE CASES.

01:48:15.155 --> 01:48:16.723
ARE SETTLED THROUGH THAT

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:20.160
MEDIATION PROCESS AND ONLY 2% OF

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:22.329
ALL CASES ACTUALLY ARE EVER

01:48:22.395 --> 01:48:24.764
FILED THE DEAL WITH SEQUEL.

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:29.069
SO OF THAT 2% 85% ARE RESOLVED

01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:31.137
THROUGH THAT MEDI A MEDIATION

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:32.873
PROCESS SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.207
IF WE REALLY WANT TO FIX THE

01:48:34.274 --> 01:48:35.909
PROBLEM NOT JUST OPEN UP THE

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:38.578
STATE. FOR ALL SORTS OF

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:40.313
DEVELOPMENT THAT WE CANNOT DEAL

01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.581
WITH.

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:42.382
AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT THE

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:44.851
HOMELESS AS OF THE ONE CHILD IN

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.286
FRONT LIKE WE DO WITH WOMEN IN

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:48.521
ORPHANS IN WAR.

01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:49.990
THE PROBLEM REALLY IS.

01:48:50.056 --> 01:48:52.292
A SITUATION WHERE WE'VE GOT A

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.861
NUMBER OF CONCERNS THE DEAL WITH

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.763
LAND USE AND IF YOU ARE CITY PER

01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:57.697
OF SOMEONE WHO CAME FROM CITY

01:48:57.764 --> 01:48:58.832
GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST

01:48:58.899 --> 01:48:59.900
ABOUT THAT.

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:02.669
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BUILD.

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.771
WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.940
WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF HIGH END

01:49:07.007 --> 01:49:08.675
DEVELOPMENT THAT GOES ON WE

01:49:08.742 --> 01:49:09.943
AREN'T BUILDING APARTMENTS

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:11.311
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PROFITABLE

01:49:11.378 --> 01:49:12.712
LET'S TAKE A LOOK?

01:49:12.779 --> 01:49:14.481
AT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO

01:49:14.547 --> 01:49:16.583
BUILD MORE HIGH DENSITY HOUSING

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.051
AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:20.020
RESPECTFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT MY

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:21.321
LAST POINT THAT IF I MAY.

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.990
MISTER PRESIDENT MAKE IT IS THAT

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.225
PART OF THE DEAL WITH SEQUEL IS

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:29.696
THERE IS ONLY ONE RECOURSE.

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:30.864
AND THAT IS THROUGH THE COURTS.

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:32.432
WE DON'T HAVE A DEPARTMENT THAT

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:34.601
WE CAN GO TO FIRST THAT'S WHY WE

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:37.037
HAVE THE PROCESS WE DO.

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:39.706
IF WE REALLY CARE ABOUT REDUCING

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:41.441
THE TIME FRAME AND GETTING

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:43.843
RESOLUTION TO THESE MATTERS.

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.478
THEN WE WILL DO MEDIATION

01:49:45.545 --> 01:49:48.114
THROUGH THE COURTS WHERE ALMOST

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:50.116
EVERY CASE IS SETTLED SEQUENCE

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:52.018

STUDENT SUCCESS IT IS.

02:34:13.177 --> 02:34:14.478

MAKING IT SAFER THAN TYLENOL.

02:34:41.105 --> 02:34:44.908

THE DRUG.

02:37:43.520 --> 02:37:45.722
IN ADDITION ABORTION IS A HIGHLY

02:37:45.789 --> 02:37:47.591
PERSONAL DECISION.

02:37:47.658 --> 02:37:49.593
THAT MUST BE MADE BY WOMAN.

02:37:49.660 --> 02:37:51.728

02:38:05.943 --> 02:38:08.245
BY CHANCE.

02:38:08.312 --> 02:38:09.680
HAVING CAMPUSES PROVIDE THE

02:38:09.746 --> 02:38:11.615
ABORTION PILL GIVES THIS FALSE

02:38:11.682 --> 02:38:13.283
SENSE OF SECURITY.

02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:14.685
THE YOUNG COLLEGE WOMEN SEEKING

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.220
ABORTION THIS IS A MATTER OF

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:17.588
TAKING MEDICATION A COUPLE DAYS

02:38:17.654 --> 02:38:18.956

IN OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES NEEDS TO

02:38:26.563 --> 02:38:28.232
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

02:38:28.298 --> 02:38:30.000
AND GIVEN THEM A FALSE SENSE OF

02:38:30.067 --> 02:38:31.668
SECURITY WITH AN EASY FIX TO

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:32.870
THEIR ABORTION NEEDS DOESN'T

02:38:32.936 --> 02:38:34.738
SEEM LIKE A WISE COURSE OF

02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:36.607
ACTION.

02:38:36.673 --> 02:38:38.008
WHEN THE ABORTION PILL DOESN'T

02:38:38.075 --> 02:38:39.543
WORK FOR THE FIRST TIME?

02:38:39.610 --> 02:38:41.078
THE WOMAN USUALLY DOESN'T

02:38:41.144 --> 02:38:43.013
REALIZE IT IT TAKES TIME.

02:38:43.080 --> 02:38:44.781
THIS OFTEN RESULTS IN A SURGICAL

02:38:44.848 --> 02:38:46.450
ABORTION BEING REQUIRED IN THE

02:38:46.516 --> 02:38:47.284

02:38:47.351 --> 02:38:48.986
GREATER SENSE THE TIME LAPSE

02:38:49.052 --> 02:38:50.554
BETWEEN -- TAKING THE PILL AND

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:52.089
THE SURGICAL ABORTION IS ALLOW

02:38:52.155 --> 02:38:53.390
THE BABY TO MATURE. TO A GREATER

02:38:53.457 --> 02:38:55.325
EXTENT.

02:38:55.392 --> 02:38:56.627
THIS MEANS THAT THE ABORTION

02:38:56.693 --> 02:38:58.562
WILL TAKE PLACE AT A LATER DATE.

02:38:58.629 --> 02:39:00.197
WHICH INCREASES COMPLICATIONS TO

02:39:00.264 --> 02:39:01.531
THE MOTHER SAYS THE BABY IS MORE

02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:03.500
FULLY GROWN.

02:39:03.567 --> 02:39:05.202
THE MEDICAL ABORTION IS SO MUCH

02:39:05.269 --> 02:39:06.904
MORE DANGEROUS BECAUSE THERE IS

02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:09.006
NO INTERACTION WITH THE DOCTOR.

02:39:09.072 --> 02:39:11.241
DURING THE DRAMATIC EXPERIENCE.

THIS BILL REST A STATE FINANCES

PLACE MORE BURDENS ON STUDENT

HEALTH CLINICS THAT SHOULD NOT

BE PROVIDING SUCH SENSITIVE

02:40:48.572 --> 02:40:49.506

I THINK WE'RE ONLY OFFERING ONE

02:40:51.208 --> 02:40:53.010
SOLUTION WHICH IS ABORTION AND

02:40:53.076 --> 02:40:54.511
WE COULD BE OFFERING EIGHT FOR

02:40:54.578 --> 02:40:56.446

02:41:07.324 --> 02:41:08.959
THE PRESIDENT -- SENATORS I

02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:11.461
STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL

02:41:11.528 --> 02:41:14.965
AND CERTAINLY AS A PHYSICIAN --

02:41:15.032 --> 02:41:16.333
OF AND NOW I'M A PEDIATRICIAN

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.135
I'VE COULD ALSO CONSULT WITH MY

02:41:18.201 --> 02:41:19.469
COLLEAGUES AT SAID JACKSON

02:41:19.536 --> 02:41:21.038
GYNECOLOGY AND THEY HAVE

02:41:21.104 --> 02:41:23.573
EXPRESSED TO ME AND THAT TO THEY

02:41:23.640 --> 02:41:26.109
ARE -- IN IN THAT THEY FEEL THAT

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:27.911
THIS IS ACTUALLY WOULD BE A VERY

02:41:27.978 --> 02:41:31.515
SAFE APPROACH -- I THINK OUR

02:41:31.581 --> 02:41:33.683
STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS -- WHICH

02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:35.552
ARE OFTEN IF IT'S OUR STAFFS --

02:41:35.619 --> 02:41:36.820
PHYSICIANS ON STAFF THAT THERE

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:39.056
THAT DAY -- CAN PROVIDE THIS

02:41:39.122 --> 02:41:41.825
CARE IN A IN A SAFE MANNER.

02:41:41.892 --> 02:41:44.127
AND THE I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE

02:41:44.194 --> 02:41:45.929
DO HAVE AN ACCESS PROBLEM SO WE

02:41:45.996 --> 02:41:47.898
CAN TALK ABOUT DISTANCES AND SO

02:41:47.964 --> 02:41:50.333
FORTH BUT I THINK IF ANY OF US.

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.701
REMEMBER BACK TO OUR COLLEGE

02:41:51.768 --> 02:41:54.871
DAYS -- THAT -- YOU KNOW GET

02:41:54.938 --> 02:41:56.907
GETTING OFF CAMPUS IS NOT ALWAYS

02:41:56.973 --> 02:41:58.942
THAT EASY I MEAN YOU CAN YOU CAN

02:41:59.009 --> 02:42:01.912
TRY AND PEOPLE CAN DO IT BUT WE

02:42:01.978 --> 02:42:03.580
WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:42:03.647 --> 02:42:05.248
HOW WE FOR SURE THAT WE PROVIDE

02:42:05.315 --> 02:42:10.253
FOR IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A

02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:11.688
LEGAL.

02:42:11.755 --> 02:42:13.824
LEGAL HEALTH SERVICE -- THAT IS --

02:42:13.890 --> 02:42:15.792
CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH OF A

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:17.494
GROUP OF STUDENTS ON CAMPUS AND

02:42:17.561 --> 02:42:20.564
THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND SO --

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:21.998
I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE ALSO

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:23.433
IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT HAVE

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:24.734
BEEN RAISED TO PROVIDE THE

02:42:24.801 --> 02:42:26.736
SERVICE -- BUT I THINK MORE

02:42:26.803 --> 02:42:28.538
IMPORTANTLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT --

02:42:28.605 --> 02:42:30.740
THE HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS AND

02:42:30.807 --> 02:42:32.075
THAT INCLUDES TO REPRODUCTIVE

02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:34.044
HEALTH -- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:35.979
SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED AND IT

02:42:36.046 --> 02:42:37.747
WILL BE DONE SAFELY AND IT WILL

02:42:37.814 --> 02:42:38.882
BE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT'S

02:42:38.949 --> 02:42:40.817
AVAILABLE TO THE STUDENTS WHO

02:42:40.884 --> 02:42:42.285
NEED TO HAVE IT I SPEAK AND I

02:42:42.352 --> 02:42:45.455
ASK THAT WE FOR AN AYE VOTE ON

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.523
THIS BILL.

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:48.191
THANK YOU CENTER PAN.

02:42:48.258 --> 02:42:50.026
SEEING NO OTHER MIKE'S UP.

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:51.495
THERE LEYVA YOU MAY CLOSE.

02:42:51.561 --> 02:42:52.462
THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT

02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:53.630
MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE

02:42:53.697 --> 02:42:55.832
DISCUSSION.

02:42:55.899 --> 02:42:57.767
I'M NOT SURE WHERE TO START WITH

02:42:57.834 --> 02:42:59.669
SOME OF THE INACCURACIES THAT MY

02:42:59.736 --> 02:43:01.771
COLLEAGUE FROM CONNECT TO MACULA

02:43:01.838 --> 02:43:03.173
STATED.

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:04.708
BUT I THINK WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE

02:43:04.774 --> 02:43:06.343
TO SAY IS THAT.

02:43:06.409 --> 02:43:08.044
WHEN I GOT ELECTED WHEN I RAN

02:43:08.111 --> 02:43:09.379
FOR OFFICE I RAN FOR OFFICE

02:43:09.446 --> 02:43:11.114
BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

02:43:11.181 --> 02:43:13.650
THAT WORKERS HAD A GOOD JOB THAT

02:43:13.717 --> 02:43:15.018
THEY HAD BENEFITS THEY HAD A

02:43:15.085 --> 02:43:16.753
PENSION?

02:43:16.820 --> 02:43:17.554
AND THEN.

02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:19.589
VERY SOON AFTER I WAS ELECTED I

02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:21.358
REALIZE THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE

02:43:21.424 --> 02:43:24.060
UNDER ATTACK STILL IN THE TWENTY

02:43:24.127 --> 02:43:26.296
FIRST CENTURY WE HEAR ABOUT ALL

02:43:26.363 --> 02:43:27.697
THE TIME WITH PAY EQUITY.

02:43:27.764 --> 02:43:30.033
WE HEAR ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:31.701
THAT STILL HAPPENS DAILY.

02:43:31.768 --> 02:43:33.036
AND NOW SOMETHING THAT WAS

02:43:33.103 --> 02:43:34.571
DECIDED.

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:36.473
A HALF A CENTURY AGO WE SEE

02:43:36.540 --> 02:43:38.608
ATTACKS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT

02:43:38.675 --> 02:43:41.111
WOMEN SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO

02:43:41.178 --> 02:43:42.979
THEIR CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:43:43.046 --> 02:43:44.481
RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

02:43:44.548 --> 02:43:46.283
I'M NOT ASKING ANYONE TO HAVE AN

02:43:46.349 --> 02:43:48.385
ABORTION BUT I'M SAYING EVERY

02:43:48.451 --> 02:43:50.153
WOMAN WHO NEEDS OR WANTS ONE

02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:51.655
SHOULD HAVE ACCESS.

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:54.591
AND I STRONGLY DISAGREE THAT THE

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:56.393
WOMEN ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

02:43:56.459 --> 02:43:58.695
ACTUALLY HAVE ACCESS AND YOU IT

02:43:58.762 --> 02:44:00.063
THE INTERESTING THING.

02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:01.965
IS THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS OVER

02:44:02.032 --> 02:44:04.267
THE LAST THREE YEARS THE ONLY

02:44:04.334 --> 02:44:06.169
PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAID TO ME THAT

02:44:06.236 --> 02:44:08.538
THEY FELT THAT WOMEN HAVE ACCESS

02:44:08.605 --> 02:44:09.739
OR ALL WHITE MEN.

02:44:09.806 --> 02:44:11.274
SO I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE

02:44:11.341 --> 02:44:13.677
EVER TRIED TO ACCESS AN ABORTION

02:44:13.743 --> 02:44:15.912
SO THEY PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:17.180
IT'S LIKE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:18.281
THE PROCESS.

02:44:18.348 --> 02:44:19.482
AND FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT ARE

02:44:19.549 --> 02:44:20.951
CONCERNED ABOUT MEDICATED

02:44:21.017 --> 02:44:22.686
ABORTION NOT CLICK CHEMICAL

02:44:22.752 --> 02:44:24.754
ABORTION MEDICATED ABORTION

02:44:24.821 --> 02:44:26.456
BEING DANGEROUS WHAT ARE YOU

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:27.891
ASKING FOR DO YOU THINK WOMEN

02:44:27.958 --> 02:44:28.992
SHOULD HAVE A SURGICAL ABORTION

02:44:29.059 --> 02:44:31.528
WHICH PROVIDE THAT ON CAMPUS.

02:44:31.595 --> 02:44:33.730
NOTHING IS PERFECT BUT MEDICATED

02:44:33.797 --> 02:44:35.865
ABORTION HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE

02:44:35.932 --> 02:44:38.368
SAFE AND I WILL.

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:40.070
I JUST CONTINUE TO BE SHOCKED

02:44:40.136 --> 02:44:41.805
THAT AT FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD I

02:44:41.871 --> 02:44:43.373
HAVE TO FIGHT FOR WOMEN COMING

02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:45.175
UP BEHIND ME AND WOMEN STANDING

02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:47.077
BESIDE ME. TO HAVE ACCESS THE

02:44:47.143 --> 02:44:48.912
RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND

02:44:48.979 --> 02:44:50.447
THIS STARTED FROM OUR YOUNG

02:44:50.513 --> 02:44:52.315
PEOPLE AT THE UNIVERSITY

02:44:52.382 --> 02:44:55.652
BERKELEY STUDENTS OUR FUTURE WHO

02:44:55.719 --> 02:44:57.687
WANT THIS IN ISN'T IT OUR JOB TO

02:44:57.754 --> 02:44:58.822
TRY AND HELP THEM.

02:44:58.888 --> 02:45:00.790
SO MEMBERS WELL WE SEE ACROSS

02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:02.592
THE COUNTRY ROLL BACKS ON

02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:04.928
WOMEN'S RIGHTS BECAUSE REALLY

02:45:04.995 --> 02:45:07.063
NOT HAVING ACCESS TO AN ABORTION.

02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:08.498
IS JUST A CONTROL ISSUE IS AND

02:45:08.565 --> 02:45:10.533
IT IS JUST TELLING WOMEN WHAT

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:11.768
THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO WITH THEIR

02:45:11.835 --> 02:45:12.669
BODY.

02:45:12.736 --> 02:45:15.171
IT'S NO ONE'S JOB TO DO THAT AND

02:45:15.238 --> 02:45:17.007
NO ONE'S DECISION EXCEPT FOR THE

02:45:17.073 --> 02:45:20.076
WOMAN SO LET'S STOP CONTROLLING

02:45:20.143 --> 02:45:23.213
52% OF OUR SOCIETY AND LET WOMEN

02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:24.714
MAKE UP THEIR OWN MIND AND DO

02:45:24.781 --> 02:45:26.316
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEMSELVES.

02:45:26.383 --> 02:45:31.888
