TO ONE NUMERATOR.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.486
SO I'M IT WILL IMPROVE WEATHER

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.155
IS ASIAN PROGRAMS -- IT DIRECTS

CONSIDERING THE IMPLANTATION OF

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.962
WEATHER IS ATION MEASURES -- AND

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.363
LOW INCOME DWELLINGS IT'S AN

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.433
EXTENSION OF THE OF THE CURRENT

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.435
PROGRAM I UNDERSTAND BUT POR

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.836
FOLKS JUST IN THE NATURE BEEN

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.172
POOR ALWAYS CONSERVE WATER --

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.373
THEY HAVE A LOWER USAGE IN THE

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.543
STATE SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.812
WHAT WE EXPANDING APART?

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:06.913
IS THERE A PENALTY IF THEY DON'T

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.182

COMMUNICATIONS WITH BUSINESSES

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:15.154
SMART METERS WHICH THEY ALREADY

00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.356
HAVE INSTALLED TOGETHER TO ALLOW

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.323
THEM.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.791
TO SO THIS IS START INSTALLING

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:20.827
SMART METERS AND THESE LOW

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:22.262
INCOME.

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.129
THE SMART METERS RD AND SIT IN

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:24.297
THE BILL ALSO SAYS INCLUDES

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.698
ATTIC INSULATION CAULKING

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.066
WEATHER STRIPPING.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.501
LOW FLOW SHOWERHEADS WATER

00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:30.236
HEADLINE WATER HEATER BLANKETS

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.871
DOOR AND BUILDING ENVELOPE

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.675
REPAIRS WHICH REDUCE AIR THAT ON

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.276
FOR THE THOSE VARIOUS FACTORS.

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:42.048
THANK YOU OF SIR MORE LIKE THANK

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.783
YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D I'D TO A

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.717
LITTLE CONFUSED SO I'M JUST

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.220
CURIOUS -- YOU MENTION WATER

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.554
EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES TO

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:50.890
REDUCE REDUCE ENERGY AND YOU

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:51.991
MENTIONED LOW FLOW SHOWERHEADS.

00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:53.292
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.061
WHAT IS WATER CONSERVATION

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:56.462
MEASURES THAT RESULT IN ENERGY

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.699
SAVINGS.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.134
WE'LL BE LIKE A NEW WATER HEATER

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.569
THAT USES LESS ELECTRICITY YOUR

00:05:03.636 --> 00:05:04.637
YES I'VE JUST EVERYTHING WHAT

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:06.472
EVERYTHING MOVING WATER IS IS IT

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:07.607
THERE'S A CORRELATION DIRECT

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:09.142
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO THE

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.044
ECHO ENERGY COSTS ROSE TO THE

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.678
CALIFORNIA MOVE WATERS

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:12.512
EXTRAORDINARY.

00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:13.846
SO THE STATE YOU CAN CONSERVE

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.148
WATER CONSERVE ENERGY THERE'S A

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.083
NEXUS BETWEEN THE TWO NOT JUST

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.917
WITH RESPECT TO MOVING WATER

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.353
FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.755
OR FROM TWO US SOLVENCY.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.726
HOURS OF TALK OF THE CITY BUT

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:28.194
BUT IT ALSO.

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:29.095
IT IS A CORRELATION SO THE MORE

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.463
YOU CAN SAY WATER THE MORE YOU

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.997
SAVE ENERGY.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.732
THEN HOW DOES THAT HELP.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:34.867
IN THE CASES CENTER BRADFORD'S.

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:36.402
LINE OF QUESTIONING ARE WE

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.471
GIVING NEW WATER HEATERS.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.072
TO NOT WHAT WOULD I WORK WE

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:40.840
COULD INSTALL PROJECTS THAT HAVE

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.408
SOLAR HEATERS TO WATER THAT

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.343
WOULD ELIMINATE THE USE OF GAS

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.713
FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF THERE

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.447
WAS A WILL [inaudible]

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:51.350
BUT AND AND THAT IS IN THE AREA

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:52.685
OF ENERGY CONSERVATION AS AN

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.520
EXAMPLE.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:55.755
I JUST DIDN'T SEE HOW WATER

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.323
CONSERVATION COULD MEAN

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.191
INSTALLING.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:05:59.525
LOWER FLUSH TOILETS NEW

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:01.561
TECHNOLOGY THAT ALLOWS SAVINGS

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.695
AND WATER IN THE WAY.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:05.231
SHOWERS OPERATE THE WAY TOILETS

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:10.470
