THIS IS -- AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW FULL DAY -- WITH A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENING WE JUST ENDED A SESSION ON THE FLOOR HONORING WOMEN FOR THE MONTH -- WHICH TAKES QUITE A BIT OF TIME SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT AND WAITING FOR US -- WE CAN CALL THE MEETING TO ORDER -- PLEASE CALL ROLE [inaudible] WEBER. HERE. JONES SAWYER LACKEY THERE MELENDEZ STONE. THANK YOU THAT MEANS WE HAVE A QUORUM WE DON'T HAVE ANY ACTION ITEMS SO IT'S REALLY ALL OF PRESENTATION AND INFORMATION. AND WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ISSUES -- ONE AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BE HOPEFULLY AS A BRIEF AN EXPEDITIOUS AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR IT'S ALREADY FOUR CLOCK. AND UP YET THE INFORMATION WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT I THINK MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE READ THE VARIOUS REPORTS RELATING TO THE ITEMS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US AND HAVE READ MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET SOME OF THAT ON RECORD BUT ALSO IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS. AT THE END OF ALL OF THE ISSUES OF THE FOUR ISSUES THEN WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS. AND YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS WE HOPE THOSE COMMENTS WILL BE DIRECTED TO WHETHER NOT ON ISSUES THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE COVERED. THAT YOU THINK ARE IMPORTANT IT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE RECORD -- WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ISSUE ONE AND CDC ARE -- WITH THE PLEASE COME FORWARD -- WILL PROVIDE A POPULATION OVERVIEW A STATUS UPDATE ON AN OUT OF STATE CONTRACT BIDS AND WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUAL WE RETURNING TO CALIFORNIA AND A PROGRESS UPDATE. ON PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WOMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME A TIME TO BE HERE MY NAME IS. RALPH THE IS ON THE ACT INSECT ACTING SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE CHANGES YOU'VE SEEN AND WITHIN MY TWENTY YEARS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS -- BUT MAINLY THE FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE REDUCTION OF POPULATION IN A LITTLE BIT ON PROGRAMMING. I DO NEED TO SAY BEGIN MY CURRENT NINETEEN NINETY ONE AS A YOUNG CORRECTIONAL OFFICER WHEN THE POPULATION WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT SIXTEEN YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS A FACILITY CAPITA BALLOON TO ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND SO I'VE SEEN THE CAUSES OF OVERCROWDING MISSING THE IMPACTS. OF WHAT IT'S DONE IN OUR PRISON SYSTEMS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE DURING THAT TIME OF OVERCROWDING AND WHAT CAN'T BE DONE. TODAY THE POPULATION IS JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND WE'VE. MADE THESE THINGS POSSIBLE IN THE CITY OF THE CALIFORNIA HAVE MADE THESE THINGS POSSIBLE IN VARIOUS WAYS MORE IMPORTANTLY -- BECAUSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION. FIFTY SEVEN WHICH GIVE THE SECRETARY OF CORRECTIONS THE THIS BROKEN SITUATION PROCESSES FOR OFFENDERS. WHO HAVE SERVED THE FULL TERM OF THEIR PRIMARY FENCE IT ALSO AUTHORIZES THE SECRETARY TO AWARD CREDITS FOR INMATES PARTICIPATION? AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WHICH PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED CHANGES IN LAW. ALSO TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND NONVIOLENT DETERMINE THE SENTENCE INMATES BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE SUITABILITY HEARING. BY THE BROUGHT -- BORDER PAROLE HEARINGS ALSO. CDC ARE SIMPLE AMENDED REGULATIONS UNDER THE THE DEPARTMENT WHICH HAS AWARDED FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION CREDITS WHICH COMES OUT TO OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX PRISON YEARS OFFICE SENTENCES. BASED ON POP AS A FIFTY SEVEN IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO GIVE A BREAK DOWN WHAT SOME OF THOSE ARE. INMATES PARTICIPATED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS THAT THEY EARN SCHOOL DIPLOMA COLLEGE DEGREES AND THEY'VE EARNED -- NINE THOUSAND FORTY ONE CREDITS AND THAT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOURTH -- TWO THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PRISONERS OFFICE SENTENCES. INMATES PARTICIPATED IN RIGOROUS CURRICULUM BASED IN PROGRAMS SUCH AS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR TREATMENT WHICH THEY EARN MILESTONES IN THE INMATES OF EARNED -- OVER TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND YOUR CREDITS WHICH COMES TO BUY SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY FIVE YEARS OFFICE SENTENCES. INMATES PARTICIPATED IN SELF HELP PROGRAMS LIKE -- AA AND AAA -- GOING OUT TO BUY GOING IN SHAKESPEARE ACTORS GANG THESE INMATES UP EARNED OVER FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINE CREDITS WHICH EQUALS TO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED NINETY YEARS OFF OF SENTENCES. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED WE ALSO ALLOW FOR WE ALSO OFFER OVER TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE CAN OR IN THESE CREDITS. AND THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT AB ONE THOUSAND SLOTS FOR INMATES TO PARTICIPATE. OUR GOAL IS TO OFFER A TOTAL OF OVER THREE THOUSAND OPPORTUNE RACK CREDITS IN PROGRAMS WHICH WILL EXPAND THE SLOTS. ROSS LOOKING TO CREATE PROGRAMS FOR INMATES IN MENTAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL NEEDS TO INCENTIVIZE PARTICIPATION IN TREATMENT. WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING NURSING AND STOP SPONSORED PATIENT EDUCATION INMATE ADVISORY GROUPS AT THE CALIFORNIA SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT FACILITY. AND AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL FACILITIES. ALL THESE NUMBERS MAY SEEM OPPRESSIVE THE FULL IMPACT PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN I BELIEVE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN YET. BECAUSE I LIKE EARLIER PROPOSITIONS PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX AND FORTY SEVEN WHICH IMPACTS -- JUST A SPECIFIC GROUP OF INMATES IN A PARTICULAR WAY PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN IMPACTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE INMATE POPULATION BASED ON A MULTITUDE OF FACTORS. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT OFFENDERS -- THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS PROPOSITION TOOK AFFECT HAVE HAD THEIR SENTENCES REDUCED BY NEARLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS THAT'S THE AVERAGE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN GIVEN MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN PROGRAMS THAT THAT OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE PARTICIPATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE. CREDITS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. WE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF AMENDING A REGULATIONS. TO REFINE WHAT WAS CREATED IN THE IMMEDIATE RESULT OF PROPOSITION -- FIFTY SEVEN TO BE SPECIFIC WE ARE AMENDING -- THE AMOUNT OF CREDITS INDIVIDUALS CAN EARN BY PARTICIPATING IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE'RE AMENDING IT TO ALLOW NON VIOLENT -- THE NONVIOLENT PRO PROCESS THIRD STRIKERS DUE TO RECENT LITIGATION WHICH IS -- I BELIEVE -- AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION OUR GOAL IS TO SAFELY EXPAND THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND EXTEND THEM TO AS MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN BENEFIT THEM AS POSSIBLE. I'M SURE WE ALL MAY BE ASKING AS TO WHY ON A CONSTANT BASING HOW DOES THIS AFFECT PUBLIC SAFETY WITH THESE CHANGES. RIGHT NOW I CAN SAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY BUT I CAN'T WHAT I CAN SAY IS RECIDIVISM RATE CONVICTION IN A THREE YEAR FOLLOW UP PERIOD. FOR INMATES BEING RELEASED FROM CDC DOLLARS NOW FORTY SIX POINT 1%. THAT'S FIVE POINT 4% LOWER THAN IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AT THE MAX OF OVERCROWDING. AND AN EIGHT POINT TWO LOWER THAN ITS PEAK IN. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I TAKE TO HEART -- THAT IN THE VAST CHANGES -- THAT RESEARCH HAS STAYED STABLE. THE PRISON POPULATION HAS LARGER PERCENTAGES OF SERIOUS ABOUT AN OFFENDER SENATE. OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EARN THEIR FREEDOM BY WEEKS MONTHS AND EVEN YEARS THAN OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE EARNED IT I NEED TO EMPHASIZE THAT. AT THE THOUSANDS OF THOUSANDS OF THE MOST SERIOUS OFFENDERS -- WE HAVE LIFE HAS BEEN RELEASED HOWEVER WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO IMPROVE THIS RATE TO ALLOW MORE OFFENDERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS UPON RELEASE. OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH HAS CONDUCTED ASSESSMENTS ON THE IMPACTS OF SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND WE'VE DISCOVERED. IS THAT THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR PAROLEES WITH THE TREATMENT NEED WHERE RECEIVE IN PRISON SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS TREATMENT WAS THIRTY EIGHT POINT OFFENDERS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE IN PRISON AFTER CARE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT. THE ONE YOU'RE READ -- ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE FOR OFFENDERS WHO HAVE EARNED EDUCATION MERIT CREDITS HAVE RE -- UPON RELEASE WAS 9% IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH WE DON'T THAT DOESN'T APPLY AN APPLES APPLES COMPARISON. THIS WAS LOWER THAN THE FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN FOR A ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE OF EIGHTEEN POINT. THREE SO WE ARE SEEING SOME MOVEMENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. FURTHERMORE CITY TERRACE POPULATION PROJECTS PROJECTIONS IN THE ADULT INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO DECREASE. WELL THIS IS ENCOURAGING CHANGES IN LAW SENTENCING PRACTICES IN A NUMBEROF OTHER FACTORS CAN RESULT IN CHANGES TO THESE PROJECTIONS. SO WE NEED TO REMOTE WE NEED TO REMAIN EVER VIGILANT IN MONITORING THESE PROJECTIONS. BUT I'D BE REMISS ABOUT AND TAKE A MOMENT TO REMIND THIS COMMITTEE THAT CITY SORRY WILL BE. SUBJECT TO THE POPULATION CAP TO STAB MISSION CONTINUES TO BE SUBJECT TO THE POPULATION CAP BY THE THREE JUDGE PANEL. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD A POPULATION UNDER HUNT ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE SERVE THE MONITOR THE INMATE POPULATION WE ARE THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN UNDER THAT POPULATION CAP. HOWEVER WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE INMATES LEFT IN ARIZONA. AND THE GOAL IS. TO HAVE THOSE INMATES BACK BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. THE PLAN IS IN THE GOAL IS TO BE SHIPPING ONE HUNDRED INMATES BACK TO CALIFORNIA ON A WEEKLY BASIS WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. AND RIGHT NOW I MONITOR THIS NUMBER ON A DAILY BASIS AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON TARGET. WELL IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT I SHOULD NOTE THAT -- ONE ONE FAULTY ROOF OR ONE BAD COURT RULING COULD IMPACT THAT NUMBER WITH THE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED CUSHION ONCE WAS AND IT'S COME BACK. AND SO WE TRY AND STAY AHEAD OF IT OUR FALL POPULATION PROJECTIONS A PREDICT COURT COMMITMENTS TO STATE PRISONS WILL INCREASE ONE POINT 8%. EXCEPT FOR MARGINAL DECREASE IN NINETEEN TWENTY COURT COMMITMENTS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE ZERO POINT 3% EACH YEAR. FOR THE REMAINDER OF PROJECTION CYCLES. I RAISE THIS POINT AS A STEWARD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION JUST TO EMPHASIZE THAT -- WE ARE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE THREE JUDGE PANEL CAP ALSO IMPLEMENTING POLICY CHANGES AND EXPANDING PROP FIFTY SEVEN TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. A DECADE AGO ONLY A QUARTER IN MY POPULATION WAS HOUSE ON LEVEL TWO FACILITIES. NOW OVER A THIRD POPULATES ON LEVEL TWO FACILITIES AND THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE AT THE LOWER LEVELS WE HAVE MORE -- POPPING WE HAVE MORE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE NUMBER OF INMATES A LONG TERM RESTRICTED HOUSING IN OUR OLD SHOES AT ONE POINT WAS -- FOUR THOUSAND NOW RIGHT THE LESS THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AS OF TODAY. IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE SEGREGATION'S OUR OUR ADS SAY EGGS WE WERE AT EIGHT THOUSAND WE HAVE LESS THAN. FOUR THESE ARE HIGH SECURITY BEDS OF HIGH SECURITY STAFFING NEEDS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THOSE. THIS POINT IS EVEN THOUGH THAT OUR POPULATIONS NOW EXCLUSIVELY SERIOUS ABOUT AN OFFENDER'S THE DEPARTMENT IS PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ARE HOUSING AS MANY OFFENDERS AS WE CAN. IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE BAD AND ROBUST PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES AS POSSIBLE. I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT -- SOME OF THE EXCITING THINGS ARE OUT THERE WITH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ALMOST OVER FIVE THOUSAND INMATES IN FACE TO FACE COLLEGES. THEN -- IN ALL OF OUR THIRTY TWO PRISONS. ON A MORE BASIC LEVEL TO BE MORE CRITICAL I MUST NOTE THAT. IN NINTH GRADE LEVEL WHEN THEY COME IN. AND ONLY 38% OF OUR POPULATION OF HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS OR EQUIVALENCY THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WE FOCUS ON LITERACY. THAT WE FOCUS ON THIS AND THERE IS A P. C. P. BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION TO FUND PROGRAMS. THAT -- IF SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AIM TO IMPROVE LITERACY INCLUDING DIAGNOSTIC A REMEDIAL READING -- COMPUTER BASED LEARNING ENGLISH THE YOUR MENTORING TRAINING INMATES TO BE COACHES -- TO WRAP IT UP BUT I ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT -- NINETY NUMBER THIRTY FIVE PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN DELEGATED BACK TO CDC ARE -- FROM THE FEDERAL RECEIVER THAT PUTS US AT ABOUT 50%. I LOOK CLOSELY I WORKED CLOSELY WITH MR KELSO AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER PROGRESS. I'M ALSO WORKING ON A FEW ISSUES THAT ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART THE AXIS OF FAMILIES -- TO HAVE TO THEIR LOVED ONES IN OUR STATE PRISONS. HI VANCE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS TO CONVENE A STATEWIDE TRAINING. TO IMPROVE OUR VISITING PROCESSES FOR THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND VISITORS THAT COME IN TO OUR PRISONS. SO WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM BETTER AND WE CAN HAVE A BETTER VISIT EXPERIENCE FOR THEM. I'VE ALSO TEST THE DIVISION OF ADULTS INSTITUTION IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE INSTITUTIONS. SO FAMILY MEMBERS CAN BE CALLING THE INSTITUTIONS AND CHECKING UP IN RECEIVING POSITIVE AND DIRECT INFORMATION ON THEIR LOVED ONES. ALSO WHY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT CITIES YOURS OVERHAULING IN MANY WAYS -- HOW WE MANAGE OUR TRANS GENDER POPULATIONS -- I BELIEVE WE ARE AHEAD OF THE NATION IN THAT RESPECT AND THEN -- I BELIEVE WE ARE HEAD OF WHAT -- I BELIEVE CORRECTIONS IS PROVIDING PUBLIC SAFETY I KNOW THAT -- WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND CALENDAR RIGHT THERE BECAUSE I COULD HAVE A FEW MORE BULLETS BUT ALL AND IT FOR TEMPORARY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM -- LA -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS KEY ON ON YOU KNOW WITH THE LA -- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCLUDE -- THE ANTICIPATED A FAX OF TWO RECENT POLICY CHANGES IN THE POPULATION RELATED BUDGET REQUESTS AND PROJECTIONS THAT IT SUBMITS OF THE MAY REVISION. AND THOSE ARE THE THOSE POLICY CHANGES ARE AT THE RECENT CHANGES TO CREDIT EARNING CALLED POLICIES THAT THE SECRETARY MENTIONED. AS WELL SEE THIS YEAR AS EFFORTS TO PROPOSE INMATES FOR SENTENCING REDUCTIONS -- AND THEN WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE STATUTE DIRECTING CDC ARE TO REPORT ON ITS RATIONALE FOR AN ESTIMATED POPULATION -- IMPACT OF FUTURE CHANGES COMING FROM A FINANCE. OKAY WANT TO THANK THE FACT THAT THE NET KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET FILL TING HAS JOINED. US TODAY SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. OKAY NOT YET OKAY SOME OKAY -- ANY COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS WITH REGARDS TO THE ILLEGAL OF HIS ME CVC OUR PROJECTIONS. OKAY WE GO TO ISSUE TO WHICH IS THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT. AUDIT ALL OF ITS OWN CDC OURS WE BILLET TATIAN PROGRAMMING AND DEPARTMENT -- AND THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE. ALL THIS STILL INVOLVE CDC ARE THIS IS THE CONCERNING THE AUDIT REPORT ON REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING THAT'S RIGHT OKAY -- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERIN FELDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. I WAS THE SUPERVISOR ON THIS YOU SEE OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AUDIT AND I'LL BE GOING OVER THE SOME OF THE FINDINGS RACKS AND ESSENTIALLY THE AUDIT WAS TASKED WITH REVIEWING -- NOT ONLY COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY BUT ALSO ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL THERAPIES -- EDUCATION AT CDC ARE. NOW THE PRIMARY FINDING WE HAD CONCERNED -- CPT AND THE FACT THAT. THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING DIDN'T WE FIND RESULTS AND REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM. SPECIFICALLY WE ANALYZE TWO GROUPS OF AN MASON THIS IS HOW YOU REACH THAT CONCLUSION -- THE FIRST GROUP OF INMATES WERE RELEASED IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THOSE INMATES. HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS NEEDING SOME CBT PROGRAMS AT A COMPLETED AT LEAST HALF OF THOSE. THE OTHER -- GROUP OF INMATES ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND BOTH GROUPS WERE ALSO RELEASED IN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN HOWEVER THOSE INMATES I HAD RECEIVED. NONE OF THE ATTENDED AND NOT COME HIGHER TO RELEASE -- AFTER TWO YEARS WE LOOKED AT THE RECIDIVISM RATES FOR BOTH GROUPS AND FOUND THAT THEY WERE THE SAME ESSENTIALLY 2425% RESPECTIVELY [inaudible] NOW THAT. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT I THAT -- THE CPT CLASSES HAD AN EFFECT ON REDUCING RECIDIVISM. WE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT -- IT'S DUE TO CDC OURS FAILURE TO PROPERLY ADMINISTER THESE PROGRAMS THE LEAD TO THEIR LIMITATION OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. NOW -- WE CAN WITH THE THREE MAIN AREAS THAT SEEM TO REALLY BE IMPACTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROGRAMS THE FIRST WAS -- THAT CITY C. R. REQUIRES ALL OF ITS VENDORS TO TEACH THE CVT PROGRAMS OUT OF CITY PROGRAMS JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR SUBSTANCE ABUSE COGNITIVE -- SORRY -- CRIMINAL CRIMINOLOGICAL THINKING. FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS AND ANGER MANAGEMENT. THERE WAS SOME OF THE VENDORS THAT ARE TEACHING THESE PROGRAMS THEY'RE ALL REQUIRED TO USE EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM CROOKLYN THAT'S PROVEN TO WORK HOWEVER WE FOUND IT THAT INTEND THE PRISONS WE REVIEWED. 20% OF THE CURRICULUM HAD NOT BEEN VETTED TO ASSURE THAT IT WAS EFFECTIVE. YEAH THIS IS CRITICAL. IF YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ANIMATE TO ATTEND A PROGRAM YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROGRAM IS PROVEN TO WORK. SO -- WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDC AND GOING FORWARD ENSURE THAT. THE A CREEK -- PRACTICE MORE ACTIVE OVERSIGHT. THE SECOND MAJOR ISSUE WE IDENTIFIED WAS IN TERMS OF THE ASSESSMENT TOOLS INMATES ARE GIVEN. FOR RIGHT WHEN THEY ENTER FACILITY THERE'S A COMPASS AND CS ALREADY ASSESSMENTS THOSE EVALUATED INMATES REHABILITATIVE NEEDS OVER THE NEED AT AT MARCH CATION PROGRAMS ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. FOR THE FULL GAMUT OF REHABILITATIVE SERVICES OFFERED BY CDC ARE -- THE CSR A IS A VALUE WITH RESPECT TO THE MAJOR CITY IN THE FUTURE. EVERY FOR THAT THOSE ASSESSMENT TOOLS HADN'T BEEN REEVALUATED INTENDED FIFTEEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE INMATE POPULATION IT CHANGE PRETTY DRAMATICALLY NOW YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ASSESSMENTS ARE ACCURATE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU SAYS AN INMATE IS NEEDING -- A CERTAIN CLASS WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED THAT AND ALSO THAT WHEN WHICH YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANY CRITICAL NEED FOR THESE INMATES. AND A CITY SEARS INMATE. ELECTION HAS CHANGED PRETTY DRAMATICALLY SINCE PROP. FORTY SEVEN FINALLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY CDC ARE IS -- FAILING TO PROPERLY PRIORITIZE INMATES INTO. THESE PROGRAMS OFF OF THE WAIT LIST. SO WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT CITY SERVICE CAN -- RISK LOW NEED IN BATES INTO THESE PROGRAMS WHEN SLOTS BECAME AVAILABLE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE ASSIGNED TO ANY OTHER ACTIVITY. AND THAT THAT'S HOW THE WEIGHTLESS FOR PRIORITIZING THEM -- INSTEAD OF THESE HIGH RISK HIGH NEED IN BATES THAT WERE MADE ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES LIKE -- SOUNDS KEEPING OR IN THE WORKING IN THE KITCHEN. YOU KNOW THEY COULD HAVE A TRANSFER THESE WERE REHABILITATIVE ACTIVITIES THEY WERE ENGAGED IN AND THE NEEDED THESE PROGRAMS BUT INSTEAD THEY WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE AND LOW RISK LOW NEED INMATES -- SORRY LOOK RISK LIVE NEED INMATES WERE -- PUT IN INSTEAD. WE THINK THIS CONTRIBUTED TO SOME -- PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL -- LOW ENROLLMENT NUMBERS FOR THE CITIES YOUR PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC WHICH IS YOU GET -- INMATES WITH RSS WITHOUT MODERATE TO HIGH NEED. IN ANY PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY THEY PUT IN. NOW WE'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT I'VE JUST DISCUSSED BUT WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE CDC ARE TO IMPLEMENT OVER. A PLAN THAT WE'VE DESCRIBED IN A REPORT. NOW THIS PLAN WOULD REQUIRE CDC ARE TO CONTRACT WITH AN EXTERNAL RESEARCHER SUCH AS UC IRVINE -- OR ANY OTHER OUTSIDE RESEARCH WITH LARGE RESEARCH ENTITY AND THAT THAT ENTITY WITHIN CONDUCT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS BECAUSE OUR PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS TO SEE BRITISH DOESN'T APPEAR TO CHAU RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ATTENDING THESE CLASSES AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM. BUT WE NEED TO SEE HOW A VOCATIONAL IT EDUCATION IMPACT THESE RECIDIVISM RATES. BECAUSE THE GOAL IS. TO HAVE THIS FISCAL YEAR CDC OUR CONTRACT WITH -- A RESEARCH ENTITY HAVE THE IT'S A TO CONDUCT THAT WORK AND THEN AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT CITY'S YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT WHAT'S INEFFECTIVE. AND START ELIMINATING THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEN EXPANDING THOSE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY ARE PROVN TO WORK OR COMBINATIONS THEREOF -- THAT'S THE KIND OF HIGH LEVEL FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS THE REPORT NOW FREE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM HELLO. FIND THAT. BECAUSE MORE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE FIND THAT THIS REPORT IS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT ON IMPROVING IN PRISON REHABILITATION -- THIS INCLUDES TO RECOMMENDING A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT EVALUATION LOOK AT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE CDC OR ANYONE FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ANYONE THE CITY OUR RESPONSE. AND CHAIR MEMBERS THE ASSEMBLY. MY NAME IS BRENT CHOATE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. FOR C. C. R.. AS NOTED IN THE AUDIT REPORT. CDC ARE AGREES WITH THE FINDINGS AND WILL WORK TO FIND REMEDY TO WEAKNESS TO WITNESSES AND BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAMMING. AS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. I UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT I PLAY. IN ENSURING THE BEST USE OF STATE FOR DANCE BOTH PRISON AND PUBLIC SAFETY. MY TEAM WAS AWARE OF THE ISSUES. DESCRIBED IN THE AUDIT. AND BEGAN DEVELOPING REMEDIES SINCE SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN THE NEW D. R. P. OR DIVISION REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS TEAM WAS APPOINTED. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION AN EXTRACTION. PRIORITIZE PLACEMENT INTO PROGRAMMING. AND CREATE PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY AND FIDELITY MEASURES [inaudible] MORE SPECIFICALLY. WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN OR COMPLETED THE PROCESS OF IF I AWAITING CDC OURS CURRENT RISK IN THESE ASSESSMENT TOOL. ANALYSIS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT CURRICULUM TO ENSURE IS EVIDENCE BASED. MADE CHANGES TO THE DEPARTMENT'S STRATEGIC FENDER. AMANDA ADMITS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SONGS. TO AUTOMATE PROGRAM WAITING LISTS BASED ON RISK AND NEED. WE'VE ALSO MET WITH UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER RESEARCHERS TO BEGIN THE RESEARCH DESIGN FOR AN EFFECTIVE LONGITUDINAL RECIDIVISM STUDY. WE'RE COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO LOOK AND LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING PERIODIC UPDATES. TO THE LEGISLATURE AS REQUESTED. HELP YOU DECIDE AN INSTITUTION IT'S GOING TO BE MONITORING YOU SAY IT. RESEARCH INSTITUTION EVEN SIDE ONLY NOT TODAY WE'VE SPOKEN WITH A COUPLE OF AND WERE WERE STILL WORKING ON THAT. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS YES MY SYSTEM. THANK YOU. JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AT THE GUY VISITED ALL OF YOUR FACILITIES BEGAN TO A FEW OF THEM. AND THERE SEEMS TO BE. SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE FACILITIES WITH WHAT'S AVAILABLE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE PROGRAMS THAT YOU EXACTLY PROVIDE. BUT BASED ON OTHER PROXIMITY IS THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED OR RUN BY -- PEOPLE WHO ARE NEARBY AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF THE THE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE FURTHER AWAY. IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO PARSE OUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER. BUT ARE YOU FINDING CONSISTENCIES I GUESS THIS IS BOTH FOR THE AUDITOR AS FOR CDC ARE. SOME OF THESE INCONSISTENCIES BASED ON LOCATIONS OR BASED ON SITES OR IS. COULD ALL OF THIS TRUE KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IT IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD -- WE DO HAVE. THAT ALL THE PRISONS DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROGRAMMING THAT'S GOING ON THE THE MAJORITY THE PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY STATE CIVIL SERVANTS THAT ARE PAID. THROUGH STATE FUNDS THOSE WOULD BE OUR CLASSROOM TEACHERS. AND THE WE HAVE CONTRACTORS AS WELL THAT PROVIDE ALL OF THE KIND OF BE ABLE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. SO THAT'S A SMALLER PORTION OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS ACTUALLY LITERACY AND IN PREPARATION TOWARD COLLEGE PROGRAMS. RIGHT ALTHOUGH SOME AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I'VE GONE IN TO SEE THAT ARE. FOR MORE LOCALLY LACKS ADEQUATE AND AND AND A FEW OTHERS WHICH HAVE SOME PRETTY INTERESTING INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS A LOT OF WHICH HAVE TO DO MORE WITH THE THERAPEUTIC COMPONENT ADD. SOME OF THE THAT. I GUESS MORE INDEPTH QUESTIONING THAT SOME OF THE INMATES GO THROUGH AS AS WAYS TO START TO APPROACH GETTING THEMSELVES READY TO BE ABLE TO GO BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO COME IN. TRAUMATIZED AND COME IN WITH WITHOUT SOME BASIC. COGNITIVE ABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE READY TO GO INTO A SCHOOL PROGRAM A GOING TO BE REALLY READY. TO THAT APPROACH THE PROGRAMMING THAT'S THERE AND I THINK THAT MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT IT'S IT'S SORT OF SEEING SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE GET TO SEE AND SOME OF THE DAY TO DAY PROGRAMS THAT THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE SOME DIFFERENCES. SITE TO SITE. AND IF ALL OF THE INMATES ARE REALLY READY. TO TO GO INTO THE PROGRAMS AND OVERCOME SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY NEED TO OVERCOME TO BE. REALLY READY TO LEARN AND WILLING TO TO TAKE ON THAT THE EXPLORATION THAT THEY NEED TO GO. BECAUSE IF WE JUST PUT PEOPLE IN CLASSROOMS TO PUT PEOPLE IN CLASSROOMS WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO SIX EXCEPT THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT. BUT HOW DO WE ADDRESS THOSE. DEEPER ISSUES THAT SOME OF THEM NEED TO DO BECAUSE IT THERE. READING LEVELS ARE VERY LOW. THE ABILITY TO INTERACT SOMETIMES OFTEN VERY LOW. THAT TRAUMA SO THEY COME IN WITH THAT ARE ON THAT WITH THE BECOME SOMETIMES BARRIERS. TO REALIZING WHAT IS GOING TO HELP OR NOT GONNA HELP FROM SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE SCHOOL. LEARNING ABILITIES ARE VERY LOW EVEN AS WERE SORT OF STRUGGLING WITH. OR WORKING WITH WITH YOU ON THE THE COPAYS AND SORT OF MEDICAL ABILITIES THAT MEDICAL LITERACY IS VERY LOW AND SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH LIFE IN IN VARIOUS WAYS AND SOMETIMES WE NEED TO TAKE TO GET THEM TO THAT STEP IN ORDER TO THAN TO GO INTO. INTO CLASSROOMS AND SO IN SOME OF THE FACILITIES THERE'S AN ATTEMPT TO DO THAT AND OTHERS THAT I'VE SEEN. NOT ALWAYS AS MUCH I'M TRYING TO FIND. A COMMON DENOMINATOR REALLY UNDERSTAND. THAT IN THE WAY THAT PROGRAMS GET DELIVERED. YOU WANNA COME I COULD JUST COMIC QUICKLY IF WE DID FIND THAT CITY TO SEE OUR HAD EXPANDED. BASIC C. B. T. TO ALL VISITS HOWEVER THERE ALL THE I THINK WE ARE FOR JUST HAVE THESE VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS THESE MORE LOCALIZED PROGRAMS. WE'VE RECOMMENDED THAT -- IF YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH NO ANALYSIS IS BEEN DONE TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS YET. THAT IS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY CDC ARE SELECT SEVERAL PROMISING LOOKING VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS AND LOOK AT HOW WELL THEY'RE REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND THEN CONSIDER EXPANDING KNOWS IF THEY DO WORK WELL. SO I THINK THE IDEA OF KIND OF DOING SOME DUE DILIGENCE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE AND THEN -- EXPANDING THAT IF IT'S IF IT SEEMS WORTHWHILE. AND AND THAT'S A KIA AT THINK THE THE UNDERLYING POINT AS WELL. SOMETIMES WE WE LOVE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING DELIVERED THERE'S AN EXTERNAL FUNDING SOURCE OR SOME SORT OF A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM THAT COMES IN. MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE AND FOR US. GET OUT OF WE NEED TO GET OUTOF THE MODE OF JUST. DOING PROGRAM FOR SIGNATURE PROGRAM LOOK AT AFFECT THIS AND LOOK AT WHAT'S REALLY. MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE ON THE INSIDE SO THAT THAT'S GOING TO END UP PRODUCING THE RECIDIVISM AND THAT'S THE END GOAL. SOME OF THESE FOLKS WILL END UP FOR SEDATING BUT THE MORE WE CAN PREVENT THAT AND THE MORE WE WE CAN POINT TO DIRECT SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND THE BAD. WE'RE HAVIN A MUCH DEEPER IMPACT ON RECIDIVISM A PRISON POPULATIONS BACK IN COMMUNITIES THAT. IN A WAY THAT WE KNOW ARE GOING TO BE PRODUCTIVE TO THAT COMMUNITY AND KEEP THAT HELP KEEP THAT COMMITTEE SAFER RATHER THAN. GOING BACK TO THE LIFESTYLE THAT THAT THEY HAD COME IN AND SO THAT EFFECTIVENESS THAT LOOKING AT THE BROUGHT THE PROGRAMS THAT THAT AND HOW THEY THE INTERACTIVE THINK IS. ULTIMATELY PORT. YES I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THAT -- AS YOU STATED THE ECONOMY HERE TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS EXPANDED FROM LITERALLY THIRTEEN PRISON YARDS. NOT THIRTEEN PRISON BUT THIRTEEN PRISON YARDS TO EVERY YARD IN EVERY PRISON SO THE THE EXPANSION EFFORT HAS BEEN HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH -- AS WELL AS WE ARE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT. THAT THE METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE THERE'S A PRISON NEARBY THEY SUPPLY QUITE A VOLUNTEER FORCE AND AND THERE IS LIKE A SAN QUENTIN OR SOLANO OR LANCASTER STATE PRISON. THEY MAY HAVE A GREATER VOLUNTEER FORCE SO FOR THIS REASON THROUGH THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE. BEEN IMPLEMENTING THE INNOVATIVE GRANT PRO. A COUPLE. HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT THERE BEFORE ME THEY WERE IN SOME OF THE METROPOLITAN AREAS BUT THEY'VE NOW EXPANDED. TO THE LESS POPULATED PRISONS. ABOUT BUT WE ALSO REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF VALIDATING AND VERIFYING THAT THAT THEY ACTUALLY WORK. RIGHT RIGHT AND AND THAT'S GOOD AND THAT'S THE THE PART THAT WAS A LITTLE HARD. TO THE FOR ME TO KIND OF PARTS OUT WHERE. ALL OF THE THE PROGRAMS WORK SAID THAT HAS BEEN OR AND I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS LOOKED AT IS. IS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE A LOT OF VOLUNTEERS NEARBY THERE'S A BENEFIT TO THAT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THE SAME LEVEL OF IMPACTED AND ALL OF OUR FACILITIES. GOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M. I DON'T KNOW IF IT DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THROUGHOUT ASK. YES MISTER CHANG. ON A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS TO JUST TO CLARIFY FROM THE AUDITOR AND THE ONLY RECOGNITION YOU MENTIONED WAS JUST. TO TO FURTHER EVALUATION OR TO HAVE SOME EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S -- NO NO THAT'S NOT CORRECT WE HAVE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS -- TOWARD CDC ARE FOR THEM TO IMPLEMENT A FIX. THE ISSUES THAT I BROUGHT UP DURING REPRESENTATION BUT ALSO -- TO HAVE TO RESTATE THOSE SLIGHTLY -- SO CONCERNING -- THAT WITH THE WAIT LIST ISSUE AN INSERT THAT THEIR PRIORITIZING INMATES CORRECTLY -- TO DAVE PROVIDES THERE -- THE REVISED THOSE WEIGHTLESS AND ISSUE DO POLICY DIRECTIVES SO YOU CAN ENSURE THAT. THE INMATES WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS HIRES HIGHEST RISK FOR GETTING INTO THOSE OPEN SLOTS -- BOB PRACTICE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OVER THE CONTRACTING TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE CONTRACT ALL OF THE C. B. T. VENDORS ARE TEACHING CLASSES THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED. AND AB OF REALITY THEIR ASSESSMENT TOOLS. IN ADDITION WE'VE ALSO MADE RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR LIKE LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT CDC R. E. D. D. CAN SHARE. FOR INFORMATION SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU DD AND CDC ARE TO DETERMINE HOW EFFECTIVE THE VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS ARE BECAUSE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TRACK IN WEEKS AFTER RELEASE TO DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE -- JEFF THEY FOUND JOBS IN THE FIELD THAT THEY WERE TRAINED. WE HAVE ADDED A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS ON OUR PART THESE INCLUDE IN CHINA THAT ALL PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND EXTENT THAT. THIS DEPARTMENT TO DO SOMETHING INNOVATIVE WITH LEGISLATURE WENT THROUGH SOMETHING INNOVATIVE TO DO IT ON A PILOT BASIS THAT WE CAN TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IT -- WE ALSO RECOMMENDED TARGETING THE HIGHEST FIRST CAUGHT SNEAD -- OFFENDERS FOR PROGRAMS THIS IS A LOT NORTH RESEARCH IN THE FIELD -- AND ALSO RE RECOMMENDED IMPROVING OVER TIME THE PROGRAMS USING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TOM. GIVEN THE COMMON. LACK OF EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE YOU AWARE OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT EXIST. IN THIS UNIVERSE THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED. YEAH THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS AND OUR SON -- DATABASES OUT THERE ARE OF PROGRAM TO HAVE BEEN TESTED FOR EFFECTIVENESS -- I WOULD ADD THAT IN ADDITION TO MAKING FOR THE PROGRAM IS RESOURCE BASE AS BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE ELSEWHERE. MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH FIDELITY HILL OR TO INSURE THAT ACT ON THE FACT. ANSWER FIFTY DELIVERY -- TO ENSURE THAT THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED A IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT PROGRAM IT'S BEEN BASED OFF OF THAT IT'S TIME THAT SENT FAX HERE. IN IN THE PROGRAM'S YOUR FRONT DOOR ARE PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT IN CALIFORNIA BUT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA -- SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY CALIFORNIA BUT YEAH GENERALLY WITH THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM TO GO LOOK FOR A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN TESTED ELSEWHERE OR ARE GOING TO JAIL OR PRISON IN ANOTHER STATE OR A COUNTY. AND THAT ADOPTED HER. SO IT WOULD YOUR WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATION BE TO NOT. TO FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THESE PROGRAMS AND TELL OTHERS EVALUATION -- WE HAVE NOT GOT. THE TO THAT LEVEL ON THE RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] WAS A I'M NOT A CHARLOTTE THAT WHY WE DON'T GO TO THAT LEVEL I WOULD SAY THAT -- WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED OUR EVIDENCE BASED. ROAD AND SAY THEY CANCEL THE PROGRAMS ARE IN EXISTENCE. BE A PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED AND WE DON'T HAVE A EVALUATION PROGRAM SO HOT WHY WOULD WE CONTINUE. TO MAINTAIN THESE CONTRACTS UNTIL WE HAVE EVIDENCE -- ALL. TO FORTY WELL WILL NOTE THAT THE THE DAUGHTER FOUND THAT 80% OF THE PROGRAMS WERE EVIDENCE BASED. AND THE OTHER 20%. WE CONSIDER THEM ACTUALLY EVIDENCE BASED BUT THEY JUST WEREN'T FOUND WITHIN THE P. -- TO THE PEW CLEARING HOUSE. SO I APOLOGIZE I GUESS TO THE THE SAMPLE SIZE THAT HE REFERRED. TO HIM TO TO SAMPLE SIZES AND APOLOGIZED AND PLAYED IN THE YEARS ON SEVENTEEN FIVE AND ONE WAS EIGHTEEN SO -- I'VE SO WE LOOKED AT TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS AND THAT WAS -- FOR CPT ACTUALLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM -- BUT THE WELL I WAS DISCUSSING A LITTLE BIT LATER WAS THAT THE TEN PRISONS WE LOOKED AT WE LOOKED AT THE CURRICULUM OF CVT AT EACH AND WHETHER THAT WAS EVIDENCE BASED. AND WE FOUND THAT IT ONLY 17%. I'M SORRY I WE HAVE ROUGH ROUGHLY 20% WERE NOT EVIDENCE BASED SO OF THE CURRICULUM THAT WAS OFFERED AT THOSE PRISONS. MANY OF THEM WERE FOUND TO BE IN THE TIãU DATABASE THAT YOU DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THEM BEING SUCCESSFUL. WELL WE WE LOOKED VISIT LOOKS AT AUDLEY AT AT A AT A SAMPLE OF INMATES FOR THE WERE RELEASED IN. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHETHER THEY WERE EVIDENCE BASED OR NOT WE DIDN'T FIND THAT THE CVT PROGRAMS THEY OFFERED APPEAR TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH A REDUCED RATE OF RECIDIVISM HE DIDN'T DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVIDENCE BASED ARE. NOT EVIDENCE BUT THERE WERE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH -- PRESENT AT THE TIME THAT KIND OF HAD THAT -- THE POPULATION BIG ENOUGH FOR US TO DO THAT ANALYSIS WE DID CONTROL FOR THE PRUDENT TO BOTHGROUPS OF INMATES. FOR RACE AGE EDUCATION AND CRIMINALITY YOUR CONCLUSION WAS BASED ON THE PROGRAM AND THAT WAS OFFERED YOU TO FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL. THAT. SO I'M JUST GOING BACK TO SEE YOU SEE ARE YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN AWARE OF THESE SITUATIONS SINCE. SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND YOU LISTED A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE ONE OF THE KEY CRITIQUES WAS THE LACK OF EVALUATION YET -- DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE CONTINUES TO BE. TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT EVALUATING BUT NOT HAVING DONE IT JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY IT'S TAKEN MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF TO DO THAT. WELL THE OVER THE PAST. TWO AND A HALF BEEN FOCUSED ON BRINGING PROGRAMS UP. AND BRING THEM BACK TO WITHOUT OR THE WITHOUT HAVING A PLAN TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESS WE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A PLAN TO EVALUATE BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE BEFORE WE CAN EVALUATE IT. AND AN ENGLISH AND USUALLY WHEN YOU PUT A PROGRAM PLACE YOU HAVE BEEN EVALUATION PROTOCOL. WHEN YOU DO THAT SAID THAT BUT THAT DIDN'T OCCUR YOU'RE SAYING? THAT IS CORRECT. SO. KNOWING THIS ISSUE EXISTED A YEAR AND A HALF AGO EIGHTEEN MONTHS LATER WHERE DO IN THIS EVALUATION. AS I STATED EARLIER WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES. AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT THIS EVALUATION MIGHT LOOK LIKE -- THERE ARE THERE ARE MANY COMPLEXITIES TO VIOLATIONS SUCH AS THIS BECAUSE YOU YOU CAN'T JUST EVALUATES. A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA PROGRAM MORE CBT PROGRAM INDEPENDENTLY BECAUSE MANY OF THESE FOLKS HAVE WELL CALL CO CURRENT ISSUES. AND SO HOW DO YOU KNOW IN REALITY THAT IT WAS THE CVT PROGRAM THAT WORKED AS OPPOSED TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAD A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR A A DEGREE. AND SO IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED STUDY THE NEEDS TO BE DONE SO ON HE YOU YOU GOT AN ORDER SAYING THAT. THE AUDITOR'S NOT CONVINCED THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING OUR SUCCESSFUL. SO WHY CONTINUE TO DO THEM ONE I CAN NEW ONES. I HAVEN'T I HAVE AN AUDITOR I KNOW IT'S GOING TO JUMP IN YOU CAN JUMP IN ANYTIME WELL WHEN THE CLAIM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT AT THE TIME OF THE THE DATA THAT THEY LOOK AT FOR THE AUDIT WAS AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN REHABILITATION PROGRAM STATEWIDE. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS IS DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB IN GETTING THAT OUT TO ALL THE INSTITUTIONS -- THE CURRICULA THEY PICK AS PRIMARILY SCHISM IN THE AUDIT WAS THAT THE WHAT THE CURRICULUM IS EVIDENCE BASE. SOME PORTION OF IT IS NOT WITHOUT ACTUALLY BEING TAUGHT TO THEY WERE USING THE CURRICULUM THE EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM IN THE INSTITUTIONS. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A CONCERN WITH THE EVALUATION IN TERMS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THE THE POPULATION MOVING FORWARD AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY BUT IT REDUCES RECIDIVISM. BUT AGAIN WE'RE NOW LIKE INTERVIEW WE ARE IN OUR THIRD YEAR OF SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING THOSE CHANGES IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS AS THAT POPULATION TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE. OF ALL THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS BOTH C. B. T. INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATION. THIS WILL GIVE ME ONE SECOND SO Gí SAID YOU'VE DONE ON AFRICA THE WORD YOU USE BUT AN EXCELLENT JOB. THAT'S BASED ON WHAT. DOES THE SIMPLE FACT OF BEING ABLE -- TO ROLL OUT ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS STATEWIDE AS A DIRECTOR CHUCK MENTIONED THEY WERE IN THIRTEEN YARDS AND NOW THEY ARE STATEWIDE THEY ARE PROVIDING. THESE. THEY HAVE THE SLOTS AVAILABLE THEY ARE PROVIDING THE THERAPIES AND TREATMENTS TO THE I MEAN IT. CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS NUMBER OF INMATES THAT WERE SERVING AND OF THE COMPLEXITY IS GIVEN THE DIFFERENT SECURITY NEEDS EACH INSTITUTION. I WOULD CONSIDER IT SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY HAVE ANY RUNNING OUT TO TO IT MAKES. BUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE ONE WITH THE OTHER WHETHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING RECIDIVISM. AND AND AGAIN. WE ARE IN OUR THIRD YEAR OF OUR FOR BASICALLY FULL EXPANSION WE ARE AT FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS -- THAT ARE HIGHEST SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN PER INMATE. AND AGAIN IT TAKES. THREE TO FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT COHORT IS COMPLETED. TO TO SEE THE RESULTS OF RECIDIVISM BUT AS A DIRECTOR -- SKEWS ME SECRETARY D. AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN HIS OPENING REMARKS WE HAVE SEEN RESULTS AND REDUCING RECIDIVISM I GET. THAT IT'S NOT AS AS SPEEDY OR AS SIGNIFICANT I THINK AS MOST OF US WOULD PREFER BUT AGAIN WE ARE MAKING HEADWAY THEY ARE USING EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMMING THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING STEPS AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS AS IDENTIFIED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. TO ADDRESS MANY OF THOSE THINGS SO -- OF THAT OF THOSE COHORTS HAS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS AS TO WHETHER THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE IS HIGHER THAN COURTS HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH THE PROGRAM [inaudible] WELL THAT. SO THEY THEY LOOK AT AND I'M GOING TO DEFER TO HOPEFULLY -- ONE OF THE FOLKS AND SEE IF YOU ARE A REGARDING THAT BUT YOU LOOK AT THE THREE YEARS POST RELEASE. AND SO IF WE ARE JUST NOW AT NOT IS NOT WHAT WE CONSIDER FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF A REHABILITATION. TATIAN PROGRAMS BUT WHAT'S RIGHT -- REFLECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT A REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. WHEN WE START LOOKING AT RELEASES AND SEVENTEEN EIGHT THE NOW THREE YEARS OUT WE WOULD LOOK AT THAT COHORT I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S THE DATA THAT THEY LOOK AT IN TERMS OF RECIDIVISM? IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE AND WHAT IS THE DATA SHOPS ARE SO THEY LOOK AT IT WHAT IT WHAT IT CHAU EXCUSE ME. I WILL DEFER ANYBODY WANNA CONFIDENCE THAT QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL -- LOOK AT RECIDIVISM RATES FROM ELDERLY MISLI INCARCERATED BUT WE ALSO MAKE A POINT THAT THE AUDITOR'S REPORT SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT JUST 25% OF THE PROGRAMS THE CB TEAS. BUT ONLY I I DO UNDERSTAND ABOUT I'M ASK ABOUT YOUR NUMBERS WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBER SIR. SO WE'VE DONE WE'VE ROLLED OUT PROGRAMS AND NOW THEY'RE IN EVERY SINGLE YARD WORK. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE? AND WHAT DO YOU HI WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING. THERE'S A LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF FEEDBACK THE MEDIA INTRODUCED YOU TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR RYAN SEUSS -- FROM THE DIVISION RESULTED PROGRAMS. A GOOD AFTERNOON FRANCES -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR YOU -- REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS SO SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE UP FRONT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON CREATING THE TOOLS TERMS OF DATA COLLECTION DATA EXTRACTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY WHICH IS REFERENCE EARLIER BECAUSE WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE. THAT IS FOR SURROUNDING REALLY ARE CBT PROGRAMS WHERE NATIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THE CVT PROGRAMS CAN WORK IF IMPLEMENTED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY AND THAT'S THE TOOL THAT WE REALLY CREATED AROUND THOSE. THAT RECIDIVISM MENTIONED BY SECRETARY DS EARLIER SHOWS A SLIGHT REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM FOR THE MOST RECENT KEY TOLERANCE LIGHT IT WAS ABOUT 3% OFF OF THE POPULATION BASED ON FROM WHAT PERCENT OR PERCENT. I THINK IT WAS 41% 238% -- AND SO THAT'S A SLIGHT REDUCTION BUTTON WITH ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY WE THINK THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE NATIONAL PERCENTAGES WHICH IS CLOSE TO TWELVE AND 13% FOR CBT PROGRAMS. THERE WAS ALSO A REFERENCE OR EDUCATION PROGRAMS PEOPLE ACHIEVING THE LITERACY LEVEL THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENCY. AND IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN POPULATION IT WAS RELEASED WE SAW ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE FROM SOME INITIAL DATA THAT'S ABOUT NINE POINT 5%. NOW WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHICH IS NOT APPLES TO APPLES BUT IT'S A STARTING POINT TO DISCUSS HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY ARE. IT'S AROUND 18% SO THAT'S NOT A THINK -- ARE ACHIEVABLE AND WHAT WE'RE AIMING FOR SO WE'RE SEEING BITS AND PIECES OF RECIDIVISM REDUCTIONS FOR THE THINGS WERE POINT BUT WE A 100% CONCUR THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE. FOCUSING ON DATA COLLECTION EXTRACTION AND EVALUATIONS NOT FOR HIM INFORMACIóN SO WHAT'S WITH THE PLAN TO GET TO THAT 20% HOW TO CLOSE THAT 20% GAP. THE INITIAL PLAN IS IMPLEMENTATION WITH ENOUGH LONGITUDINAL DATA. AND THEN IMPLEMENT REALLY ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY MEASURES PUT IN PLACE THE STUFF THAT WE'VE WORKED WITH WHICH WAS REFERENCED IN THE AUDIT ON AND WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED TO THE MEMBERS. WHICH IS OUR WORK WITH pUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE THEY CREATED AROUND OUR COGNITIVE BE REAL TREATMENT -- COMPONENTS REALLY ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY TOOLS AND MEASURES THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AND FIDELITY IS A VERY CRITICAL -- PIECE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING RECIDIVISM REDUCTION AND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT NATIONALLY AS WELL AND I THINK JUST A NOTE EARLIER WE HAVE A A ROD. BRANDT -- DIRECTOR CHOKE MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE A BROAD ARRAY OF PROGRAMMING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT TO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION EVERYTHING FROM C. B. T. AND EDUCATION BUT ALSO. OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT COME IN AND DO OUR GRANT PROGRAMS INTO OUR VOLUNTARY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSIDERED TO BE EVIDENCE BASED OUR RESEARCH AS DEFINED IN THE FEW CLEARING HOUSE BUT THE STUFF THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING. CREATES A CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT WE THINK IN THE PRISON BRING THOSE OUTPUT MEASURES AND OUTCOME MEASURES SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS JUST ABOUT RECIDIVISM WERE LOOKING FOR IS DELIVERABLES TO SHOW. MAYBE CHANGES IN THE POPULATION CHANGES AND HOW THEY'RE REACTING TO PROGRAMMING THE ABILITY TO GET PREPARED FOR TREATMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH OPENS UP SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. TRAUMA WOUNDS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READY TO ACCOUNT FOR AND HAVE THEM THERE AND A BIG PIECE OF WHAT WE'VE DONE TO WITH -- THE STUFF THAT WE WORKED ON THE LAST YEAR'S REALLY DID ANALYTICS TOOLS MAKING SURE OUR PSALMS WEIGHTLESS PRIORITIZES RISK AND NEEDS CREATING DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS TO MAKE SURE GETTING PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT PROGRAM AT THE RIGHT TIME. SO ALL THINGS I CONCUR WITH YOU WHEN WE NEED TO KEEP FOCUSING ON TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SHOW THAT WERE RID -- YOU KNOW REDUCING OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES AS NECESSARY AND THAT'S RICH PRODUCTIONS AND RECIDIVISM AND OTHER THINGS AS WELL HOW HOW LONG TO IMPLEMENT THESE TOOLS. WELL THE LAST TWO YEARS WE REALLY CREATED ALL OF THEM SO IT'S REALLY ROLLING THEM OUT AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHT REPORTING BACK. THE WORK THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WITH RESEARCHERS IS REALLY TRYING TO FIND THINGS THAT WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO SEE AND THINGS WE BELIEVE IN WE ARE ABSOLUTE PASSION ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ARE PUTTING IN PLACE AND WE KNOW THEY CAN HAVE THESE RECIDIVISM A FAX. SO WE PLAN ON BEING IN CONTRACT CONSISTENT WITH THE AUDIT REPORT BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WORKING TOWARDS DELIVERABLES THEY'RE NOT JUST LONGITUDINAL BUT MAYBE SOME OTHER ONES. SO WHEN YOU SAY ROLL OUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN SO HOW HOW MANY HOW MANY FACILITIES. HAVE THEM HOW MANY PROGRAMS HAVE THEM AND WHAT WHICH ONES DON'T. FOR THE ACCOUNTABILITY INFIDELITY TOOLS YES SO ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS ROLLED OUT IN JANUARY AND ALL -- CHAPTER NINETEEN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND TWO WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WITH UC IRVINE PERSON TRAINING BEING DONE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING IT RIGHT BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE WANTED TO DO AND HERE HE WAS CRITICIZED ANIMAL MODEL. NOT HAVE TO ALWAYS PAY A RESEARCHER A FEW INSTITUTIONS BUT REALLY BE ABLE TO PUT SOMETHING IN BROADLY. AND SO THE ACCOUNTABILITY TOOLS ROLLED ON JANUARY AND OUR STAFF ARE GOING OUT AND DOING ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEWS NOW THEY'RE ALSO BEING TRAINED ON THE FIDELITY MEASUREMENTS. THEIR WORK CREATIVITY IS HEREBY ANOTHER HAPPENING OKAY MUSIC ROLLOUT. ALL THIRTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS OKAY SO EVERY EVERY INSTITUTION NOW. HOW'S THE TOOLS DEVELOPED BY UC IRVINE. AND NOW YOUR TEAM IS GOING IN THERE TO DOUBLE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING. AND IT ISN'T AT THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED THAT'S CORRECT. YES COLLECTED IN IMPLEMENTED WITH FIDELITY IMPLEMENTED AS THE MODEL HAD INTENDED IN TERMS TO DATE HOW FOR YOU GETTING DID YOU GET IN WEEKLY. MONTHLY WE ARE COLLECTING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS YOUR EVERY WEEK EVERYBODY THAT IS INVOLVED IN OUR PROGRAMMING -- ONE OF THE THINGS WE REALLY TRY TO FOCUS ON A LAST YEAR'S AS WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE RESEARCHERS COME IN AND NOT HAVE THE DATA WE OFTEN SEE THAT'S A PROBLEM WITH. WITH THESE RECIDIVISM REPORTS OR ANYTHING AS THEY SAY WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE DATA AVAILABLE SO OUR TEAM FOCUSED REALLY ON CREATING -- STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DATAPOINTS EVERYTHING FROM TRACKING WHEN THEY WERE ASSIGNED A PROGRAM HOW MUCH THEY'VE BEEN ASSIGNED A PROGRAM HOW MANY HOURS ARE IN THE PROGRAM. WE ALSO ROLLED OUT AT A ROBUST CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO WE'RE DOING FIDELITY MEASUREMENTS WE KNOW WHAT CURRICULUM THEY'RE WORKING ON ON WHAT DAY AND THE TREATMENT NOTES IN CASE PLAN SURROUNDING IT SO WE REALLY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE INFORMATION IS THERE SO THAT WHEN WE EXTRACTED FOR THESE FIDELITY REPORTS OR FOR THE RESEARCHERS THE REALLY GONNA HAVE A REAL FAST -- VARIETY OF INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN GET FOR CAN YOU SHARE THAT WITH US NOW. ABSOLUTELY. AND THEN. GIVE GIVEN THIS IS A WAY OUT OF THIS DOES THIS. TO THESE EVALUATION THE AN AUDITOR DO THESE EVALUATION TOOLS -- CHECK THAT BOX IN TERMS OF YOUR RECOMMENDATION OR ARE YOU EXPECTING MORE THAN THIS. THINK WE NEED TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT INCLUDED IN THESE REPORTS -- ONE TO GET IN YOUR MENTION WAS TALK ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAMS AND COMPARING THE COST EFFECTIVENESS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO SEE WHICH ONES MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE -- WE HAD ALSO HOPE THAT -- IT EVALUATION WOULD INCLUDE A COMPONENT THAT WOULD. ALLOW US TO SEE WHAT THE GAPS ARE. AND SEE WHETHER THE OR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THOSE GAPS. ANTHONY SYMBOL FROM ELLIE I DON'T THINK I'D ADD IS AS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF RECIDIVISM REDUCTION DATA IT'S A THINK ABOUT THE POPULATION THAT THEY'RE TARGETING AS THE AUTHOR NOTED IN THEIR REPORT AS WE'VE NOTED. THE FARM HAS ALWAYS PART OF THE HIGH SORT OF THE LOW RISK OF NONI SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEIR THEIR PRESENTING IN THAT LIGHT IN OTHER WORDS ARE THERE FOR REALLY FOCUSING MORE ON HIGH RISK HIGH NEED. WELL WITH THOSE OUTCOMES THE KLAXON ONE THINK ABOUT THAT. SO THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO DO YOU BREAK OUT THE ON THE DATA BASED ON THE TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL THE SERVICE. YEAH WE ARE WE ARE NOW FOCUSING I THINK WITH THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITIZATION AFFECTING THE DEPARTMENT TO FOCUS ON HIGH RISK HIGH NEED BUT IT'S BEEN A REALLY MANUAL PROCESS. SO TWO YEARS AGO WE GOT TOGETHER SOMEHOW WE LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND THAT WAS PSALMS WEIGHTLESS CHANGES ARE DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS WE PUT IN PLACE. TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION THAT CAN BE -- YOU KNOW BASS ADDRESSED THROUGH RECIDIVISM REDUCTION THAT'S HIGHEST RISK AND HIGHEST NEED BASED ON OUR TOOLS. THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PROGRAMMING GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES IN OUR PSALMS DATA SYSTEM AND SO THE NEW VERSION WILL COME LIVE ON APRIL SEVENTH TO BE ABLE. TO TO ACCOMMODATE THE A BETTER WAITING LISTS THAT. THE TOP PLACE PEOPLE ON THEIR HIGH RISK AND I NEED. AND I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT WE DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TOOLS AVAILABLE UC IRVINE THAT CITIES HERE IMPLEMENT THEM AS WELL AS THE WAITLIST ISSUE -- SO WE'LL BE FOLLOWING THAT UP -- THERE'S CITIES HERE SIXTY DAY RESPONSES DID WAS AT THE END OF THE MONTH SO WILL BEGIN IN THE DOCUMENTATION OF THAT IMPLEMENTATION AT THE END WE CAN KIND OF MAKE JUDGMENTS ON WHERE THEY ARE IN THAT PROCESS. ONE OF THE THANK A A CHEER OF FOR THE QUESTIONS IT WOULD GIVE ME A LOT LESS TO ASK. LOOK NO NO THAT'S GREAT THAT'S WONDERFUL -- THAT'S GREAT -- IT APPEARS THAT. WHO IMPLEMENTS THE PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE THE [inaudible] PERSONNEL. OF CAPABLE OF IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE FIDELITY THAT YOU TALK ABOUT. I MEAN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESEARCH BASED PROGRAMS AND I'M LISTENING TO FOLKS SAY BUT WITH THE FIDELITY WHICH MEANS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT AND AND IMPLEMENTED BY THEM. BY THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO BE THERE DO WE HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THAT -- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR IS IF. THE WE HAVE A STAFF IN PLACE TO COMPENSATE BECAUSE THE FOCUS SEEM TO BE ON GETTING MORE PROGRAMS GETTING LOTS OF PROGRAMS BUT NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS GETTING THE RIGHT PROGRAM IMPLEMENT IT THE RIGHT WAY -- SO DO WE HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THAT ARE YOU IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING FOLKS TO DO THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE DO HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THAT. THE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE TRY TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE MODEL WITH UC IRVINE WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STAFF ARE FOCUSED ON THE THINGS THAT REALLY MATTER SO ROLL OUT. OF OUR CONTRACTS WAS A SIGNIFICANT UNDERTAKING IT TAKES A LOT OF ON DAY TO DAY TASKS WORK BUT NOW THAT THAT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WE'VE REALLY RE DIRECTED THE STAFF TO SAY WITH YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN MAKING SURE THAT. OUR TREATMENTS WORKING AS THOSE THAT WOULD BE MEASURES AND SO RIGHT NOW WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT -- ON AND THE IDEA IS TWO TO THREE TIMES WE HAVE SO WE'RE NOT HE JUST GETTING ONE FIDELITY ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE WE'RE GETTING MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS OVER A YEAR. SO RESEARCHERS ARE ALSO ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT AND IF WE ARE FOR SOME REASON ARE. NOT ABLE TO ARE STRUGGLING WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION -- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT RIGHT NOW WE DO BELIEVE WE HAVE ENOUGH SO YOU BEGIN THE PROCESS YOU SAID YOU BECAME AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN OKAY AND AS A RESULT OF THAT YOU BEGAN TO DO. TO MAKE CHANGES. OKAY BUT THEY WERE NOT READY BY THE TIME HE DID THE REPORT IS THAT CORRECT. A LOT OF THE THAT MUST EARN. A LOT OF WHAT WE TRY TO DO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS REALLY ASSESS WHY. THAT THE REASONS THAT PROGRAMS WOULDN'T WORK OR WOULDN'T BE SHOWN TO WORK OR SOME OF THE STRUGGLES WE HAD THOSE WERE REALLY AROUND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS UNDER WAY. MAKING SURE WE WERE BOTH PUTTING THINGS INTO THE CRACKS SYSTEMS AND BEING ABLE TO EXTRACT THOSE THINGS OUT CREATING AND STARTING TO WORK WITH OUR STRATEGIC OFFENDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THOSE PRIVATIZATIONS WERE RIGHT. AND ALSO OUR DATA ANALYTICS TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT PERSON THE RIGHT PROGRAM IN THE RIGHT TIME. ALL OF THOSE THINGS REALLY WERE IN PLACE BECAUSE WHAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO SOME LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH STUDY. THAT CAME OUT AND SAID WELL YOU'RE PUTTING THE WRONG PERSON AND SO WE WOULD GO BACK AND GO OH WELL NOW WHEN YOU PUT THE RIGHT PERSON AND FOR THAT RESEARCH. THAT WAS THE EFFORT HERE THE LAST YEAR'S REALLY SAYING MAKE SURE WE PUT THE FOUNDATION TOGETHER CORRECTLY MAKE SURE WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE MAKE SURE WE HAVE A FIDELITY THERE. SO WHEN THE RESEARCH COMES TO FRUITION WERE ABLE BECAUSE THEY WORK NATIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THEY WORK THE ONLY WORK IF THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO PUT THEM TOGETHER THAT'S CORRECT ONLY WORK IF THE RIGHT FOLKS IN THE CLASSROOM -- WHATEVER TEACHING YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING JUST HAS TO EXIST ON A BOOK COULD YOU TAKE OFF THE SHELF AND THEN IT BECOMES A GOOD PROGRAM. IT HAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE RIGHT WAY WITH THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF STAFF. THE RIGHT FOLKS THAT ARE THERE -- SO I HOPE I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE REASON WHY OF COURSE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS -- WOULD BE SPENT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS OF REHABILITATION THIS PAST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE HOPES THAT IT WOULD OF IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THE OF THE THE INMATES THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM IT. AND THAT THE THE CONCEPT OF REHABILITATION THAT'S IN THE NAME OF THE ALL OF THE AGENCY NOW IS A REALITY RATHER THAN JUST A NAME AND SO -- WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT OUT I THINK VISITING ASKED A VERY GOOD QUESTION -- AND AND MAYBE WE SHOULD WHY SHOULD WE CONTINUE THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. YOU KNOW 80% OF THEM I GUESS ARE EFFECTIVE IS THAT CORRECT OR HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED WITH SOME FIDELITY. SO. ARE ALL REPORT DOESN'T. RECOMMEND ANY REDUCTION IN BRIGHTON -- IN THE PROGRAMS THIS TIME BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN TESTED THOROUGHLY TO KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THEY TRULY ARE OKAY SO WE THINK THAT'S WHY CECE'S HERE NEEDS -- TO CONTRACT WITH AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH IT'S INDEED DO THAT LIKE WORK AND THEN YOU'RE REALLY EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS TO NOW YOU KNOW WHAT -- WHAT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING AND YOU REALLY WANT TO EXPAND THOSE THAT FOCUS ON THEM AND THEN WHAT PROGRAMS MAYBE AREN'T AS EFFECTIVE AND BEGIN THAT CUTTING BUT [inaudible] AT THAT. NOW YOU SAID ABOUT 80% SEEM TO BE. OF EVIDENCE BASIS FOR AND BEING IMPLEMENTED AS SOON WITH SOME OF THE DELL E. IS THAT CORRECT OR JUST IT. IF I HAVE IT IN SPACE SO -- AT THE TIME OF OUR WORKED WITH YOU SEE OR BY TO DEVELOP THOSE FIDELITY TOOLS HOWEVER THEY WEREN'T IMPLEMENTED AT THE TIME OF OUR WORK NOW SO. SO I THINK AS THEY MOVE FORWARD AND WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING AT AS THAT SIXTY SIX MONTH OF ONE YOUR RESPONSES IS TO SEE OUT OF WHAT. OF REPORTS THEY'RE GETTING BACK CONCERNING HOW WELL THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY BEING -- INSURE CONSISTENTLY TAUGHT IN APPLIED ACROSS THE STATE. I THINK THE CLOSER YES GO HEAD I THINK CONTACT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL THAT THE THE STATE AUDITOR WAS ONLY FOCUSED ON OUR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS RIGHT THAT WAS THE THE REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM DISCUSSION. AND I THINK TWO OF THE TEN INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY DID SHOW -- POSITIVE REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM FOR THOSE TEN THAT THEY REVIEWED BUT THE 76% AS NOTED IN AUDIT REPORT OUR EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOCUS ON LITERACY AND JUST LIKE I SAID -- A MINUTE AGO AND SECRETARY DS DISCUSS THAT AS WELL JUST ON A ONE YEAR CONVICTION RATE WE'RE SEEING POTENTIALLY UP 250% REDUCTIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ACHIEVING THEIR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR EQUIVALENT THE SO THESE ARE THINGS WE KNOW AS WE GO FORWARD WITH OUR OUR RESEARCH PROJECTS BOTH. HOLISTICALLY THE VERY LARGE ONES AND SOME OF THE STUFF THAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR OFFICE OF RESEARCH THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN PROVIDE TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT WILL HELP -- PROVIDE A MORE ABILITY SINCE WORKING BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS WORKING EDUCATION THERE ARE SOME INDICATORS RIGHT NOW THAT SHOW THAT. AND NATIONALLY SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND OTHER COGNITIVE HERO TREATMENT WORKS UP TO YOU KNOW ON WITH A FEW RESULTS FIRST CLEARING HOUSE 13% REDUCTIONS IN RECIDIVISM SO WE BELIEVE THAT PUTTING THESE FOUNDATIONAL MEASURES IN PLACE WILL REALLY HELP US ACHIEVE THOSE REDUCTIONS AND BE ABLE TO MEASURE MOST WE GO. FOR WITH THIS LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH STUDY. OKAY -- YES JUST ONE OTHER SHOULD THINK ABOUT AS THE DEPARTMENT TALKS ABOUT ITS EVALUATION PLAN WORKING FOR OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST. AND HOW THEY PLAN ON PAYING FACE IS GONNA COME WITHIN THEIR BUDGET IS GOING TO COME WITHIN THE REHABILITATION BUDGET AND WHICH PROGRAM SERVICES WITH A NOT DUE TO FIND THE EVALUATION THAT'S ONE THING HAPPENED MENTIONED. WHICH I GUESS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU AND TAKING A MAJOR EVALUATION ASSESSMENT. OF THE OF THE PROPER PROGRAM MAYBE A FACTOR THAT IN. WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE GENERAL SIZE OF THE EVALUATION THEY CAN BE VERY COSTLY AND WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OPTIONS ABOUT -- TRYING TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WITH THAT AND SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS OUT THERE WORKING WITH NON PROFITS IS ALSO AN OPTION WE'RE DOING SOME THINGS BUT OBVIOUSLY. IF THERE WAS A REQUESTED WE WOULD DO THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT ARE THERE ARE FEDERAL -- GRANTS AVAILABLE -- THE STATEWIDE -- RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FIVE GIVES A SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS TO STATES OVER A COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE A PLAN TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. SAID SOMETHING THAT CITIES ARE COULD LOOK INTO AS WELL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. WE CAN PROBABLY TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS NOW SINCE WOULD DEAL WITH CDC ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS WILL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE. TO HOPEFULLY SHARE -- YOUR THOUGHTS. PLEASE GIVE US YOUR NAME. AND YOUR AGENCY THAT YOU REPRESENT AND WE HAVE ONE MINUTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TYAN OF ARGUS ADMIN I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INITIATE JUSTICE AND WHERE POLICY LED ORGANIZATION BUILT BY AND FOR PEOPLE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY INCARCERATION -- I'M HERE AS PART OF THAT TRANSFORMATIVE IN PRISON WORK GROUP -- THEY'RE LESS MEMBERS HERE TODAY -- BUT I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR TWELVE THOUSAND CURRENTLY INCARCERATED MEMBERS -- I'M HERE TO MAKE THREE SHORT POINTS -- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO IMPRESS UPON THIS BODY THE FACT THAT INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE BEGGING FOR ACCESS TO UP TO MORE ACCESS TO BETTER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE IN PRISON GROUPS -- AND PROGRAMS WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY LAST YEAR MORE THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND ASK THEM TO RANK OUT OF TEN POLICY PRIORITIES WHAT WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING AND THEY RANKED ACCESS TO BETTER PROGRAMS AS NUMBER -- TWO THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO RAISE IS THAT INCREASED ACCESS COMES WITH INCREASED FUNDING -- WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THIS BODY ALLOCATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE CURRENT RECOMMENDED FOR MILLION OF THE ALMOST TWELVE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET IS REALLY NOT A LOT. AND THEN THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION THAT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT WHEN IN THE FUTURE YOU'RE DOING YOUR RESEARCH ON LOOKING AT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM THE COGNITIVE BASED THERAPY PROGRAMS RUN BY CDC ARE CONSIDERED THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE -- CONSIDER ASKING YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS OR MAYBE PEOPLE WHO ARE -- ON PAROLE REENTERING IN THEIR COMMUNITY SAFELY WHAT ACTUALLY HELP TO THEM -- LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM AND YOU KNOW ALL THESE NUMBERS ARE IMPORTANT BUT THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE I'M HEARING FROM THE PEOPLE MOST DIRECTLY IMPACT IN WHO HAVE PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS AS IMPORTANT AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS JOHN GROW UP AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS FOR POTS FOR LIFE CAN NINE RESCUE AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I WAS GIVEN SIX LIFESENTENCES CONSECUTIVE TO FORTY YEARS. I WAS SENTENCED TO DIE IN THE CALIFORNIA PRISON SYSTEM. AND BECAUSE OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT COME INTO THE PRISON AND PROVIDE SELF HELP PROGRAMMING. A PEER TO PEER PROGRAMMING. AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING GENERAL -- I WAS GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE KIND OF WORK. THAT -- MISTER STONE WAS TALKING ABOUT. AND LEARN -- ABOUT -- INSIGHT AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE REHABILITATED. THESE ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- ADVERTISEMENT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AND THERE'S MORE THAN A HUNDRED NINE OF THESE. THESE PARTICULAR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN CDC ARE. AND THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MEN THAT IF MEN AND WOMEN THAT BEEN THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS. COME OUT AND BECOME SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS 99% OF LIFERS. SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY THIS IS A GROUP THAT'S BEING THAT'S BEING OVERLOOKED AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE BEING. BROUGHT IN BY THE DEPARTMENT THERE SEVERELY THAT WE HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES THANKS VERY MUCH LIKE WHO. HI MY NAME IS MARK TAYLOR AND I'M WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I SPENT OVER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF MY LIFE INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. AND WAS RELEASED LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN I FIRST ENTER PRISON I WAS A DRUG ADDICTED VIOLENT STREET GANG MEMBER. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO UTILIZE THE PEER TO PEER MODEL HELP ME ACHIEVE SOBRIETY AND ALSO HELP ME PERMANENTLY SEVER GANG TOPICS. SPECIFICALLY THE HOPE OF REDEMPTION TEAM WHICH IS A GROUP OF LIFE TERM. INMATES WHO GO BACK INSIDE HIGHER LEVEL SECURITY PRISONS IN HELP REHABILITATE PRISONERS HAS PLAYED A VITAL ROLE NOT REHABILITATION. THESE FORMER PRISONERS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE T CREATING SAFE SPACES FOR INMATES TO ENGAGE IN A REHABILITATIVE PROCESS AND THAT IN TURN ENHANCE ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY. OVER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED INMATES HAVE WENT THROUGH THIS PROGRAM SINCE SEPTEMBER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TODAY I'M HERE TO SAY THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THE PEER TO PEER MODEL PROVIDE VITAL SERVICES. TO INMATES AND CALIFORNIA PRISONS AND SHOULD BE SUPPORTED WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICHARD AND ARGUS I'M HERE REPRESENTING SUCCESS STORIES WHICH IS AN INMATE LEADER TO LEISURE TIME ACTIVITY GROUP. AND NOW A RECIPIENT OF THE INNOVATION GRANT. I STARTED SUCCESS STORIES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHILE I WAS INCARCERATED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. ILL TAGS OF THE COMMUNITY RAN GROUPS AND FROM THE C. B. TWO GROUPS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN AUDITED AND ARE BEING QUESTIONED TODAY. WHAT IT'LL TAKE GROUPS CAN DO THAT CBT GROUPS CANNOT ARE THREE THINGS SPECIFICALLY ONE BECAUSE WE AND SUCCESS STORIES WERE OF THE PEOPLE WE WERE WORKING WITH WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THE NEEDS -- THAT PEOPLE HAD IN A WAY THAT WAS DIFFERENT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE THAT PEOPLE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE NOT ONLY RECIDIVIST AT HIGHER BUT GOT INTO MORE TROUBLE AND COMMITTED MORE VIOLENCE WITHIN PRISON. BECAUSE WE ARE IN THESE GROUPS OUT IN THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE LAST TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD I STARTED THE PROGRAM. TO WE WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE AND MORE DIRECT WAYS -- THAT ARE A LITTLE HARDER TO STUDY THAN JUST RECIDIVISM FOR EXAMPLE WE STOPPED MANY FIGHTS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN. BECAUSE WE WERE AMONG THE PEER GROUP OF THE OF OUR PARTICIPANTS I WAS NOT A MANDATORY REPORTER I DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL THE COPS WHEN SOMEBODY HAD A CELL PHONE I COULD DEAL WITH THEM DIRECTLY -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO STOP A LOT OF IMPRISONED BYLANDT BY BEING OF THE COMMUNITY THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH. THIRD AND FINALLY -- WE WERE WE BUILT WE BUILT RELATIONSHIPS AUTHENTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE PRISON WHICH IS VERY HARD TO MEASURE IN A QUANTITATIVE WAY -- BUT WE HAD REALIZED THAT PEOPLE WERE COMMITTING VIOLENCE BECAUSE THEY SAW VIOLENCE AS A AS PART OF BEING A MAN. AND WE REMEDY THAT BY BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS THAT WERE NOT BASED IN VIOLENT AGAIN MEMBERSHIP BUT ACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN WHEN THERE'S NO POWER DYNAMIC. ON THAT SOMETIMES HAPPENS IN THE C. B. T. GROUPS WHERE YOU HAVE A PAID STAFF MEMBER RUNNING THE GROUP FOR THAT REASON I ADVOCATE FOR EXTENDED EXT. EXPANDING THE PROGRAMMING OF THE LEISURE TIME ACTIVITY GROUPS AND COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING CONFLATED WITH THE CVT GROUPS THAT ARE UNDER FIRE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO MY NAME IS A RICHER CREWS I SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN PRISON. AND I WAS A CVT SAP ONE'S SO I KNOW THAT WORLD AND I KNOW THE RULES OF OUTSIDE PEOPLE COMING IN TO HELP TOO BECAUSE I'M WITHIN HOURS THIS CALL THE HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY GOING AND WE DO THAT FROM A WORK. AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. AND BOTH OF THEM WORK THEY WORK FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE THERE'S NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND THE ONLY DISCREPANCY I SEE IS. C. B. T. YES THREE HUNDRED MILLION. WE GET FOUR MILLION. THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE. SO IF WE COULD EVEN THAT OUT I ME MYSELF I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME. SOME REAL REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE TO COME IN A CARE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALK pTHERE'S SOME PEOPLE IN CB TEAS I USED TO WORK WITH IN THAT CARE. I KNOW THESE PEOPLE CARE. TO IF WE CAN GET THEM IN THERE. YOU KNOW THOSE RELATIONSHIPS I THINK THAT'S WHAT HELPED ME GET OUT. BECAUSE I GOT ALL THAT LOVE FROM THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THAT'S WHY I'M OUT HERE DOING GOOD I'VE BEEN OUT SINCE LAST YEAR. IN A THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US ON SUB TWENTY MY NAME IS BORING HI I WORK FOR THE CLIP TRAINEES TO IT AS A PROJECT MANAGER. AND I WANT TO SHOWA LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH PROGRAMMING BECAUSE I I WOULD I WAS RAISED IN PRISON PRETTY MUCH. I WANT TO SYSTEM WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD. AND WHILE I WAS GOING TO SYSTEMS I WAS TRYING TO FIND MY WAY TRYING TO FIGURE STUFF OUT. AND I'VE BEEN AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM A BEEN IN THAT -- I'VE TAKE ADDITION RECOVER COUNSELING'S SO HAVE A LOOK WIDE EXPERIENCE IN PROGRAMMING BUT I CAN SAY LIKE WAS MOST AFFECTED TO ME THAT HELPED ME A LOT WELL AS FOR ME BASED PROGRAM. PARTLY BECAUSE IS BEING DONE FOR PROGRAMMING AND IS IT THE TRUST THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATIONS AND WITH THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW WE GONNA DO WITH. AND THE RELIGIOUS OF THE BILL AND SO I WAS FORTUNATE BECAUSE GOING TO THE PROGRAM I WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY CAME A CRIME HOW WE GOT TO THAT POINT WAS LIKEGOING UP OR TRAUMA EXPERIENCE. NOW IS IT WILL TAKE THOSE SKILLS AND NOW COMING OUT ON BE EMPLOYED BY THE SAME ORGANIZATION WHOSE HELP ME LEARN ABOUT MYSELF AND I'M GETTING BACK TO MY COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT'S LACKING A LOT IN ON THE C. T. PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF THAT HAPPENING SOUL -- AND I'M ALSO LEARNING TO LIKE. DOING THIS WORK THAT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WELL NOT A WORKING AS THE ORGANIZATION WAS FULLY UNDER FUNDED BY. A WHAT WORKING -- TARGET FUNDS SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE I THINK I'D LIKE CECE ARE LIKE WELL WOULD LOVE TO SEE. IS THAT REHABILITATION COULD BE THE CORNER THE CORNERSTONES OF HOW WE ONE CORRECTION HOW MUCH I DON'T SEE THAT I DON'T FEEL THAT NOW AND I'M I'M HOPING THAT. ON THIS COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE THINK DIFFERENTLY A HOW YOU FUND ON VALUE WITH THESE WE BILL TATIAN LIKE TO COMMITTEE BASED PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DO OFFER. SUCCESSFUL -- REHABILITATION TO FOLKS IN PRISON THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING THANKS FOR HAVING ME HOT MADAM CHAIR PERSONS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.

TWO THOUSAND NINE THE TICKET EIGHT WEEK WORKSHOP WITH THE ACTORS GANG PER THE LOCATION CENTER. BASICALLY CHANGED MY LIFE AND YEAH I LEARN MORE ABOUT MYSELF IN EIGHT WEEKS -- THAN THE PROGRAMS I WAS TAKING ALTOGETHER AND OBSERVE THAT MANY OF THE PROGRAMS I WAS INVOLVED IN -- COULD HAVE LIKE A PASSIVE APPROACH AND IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON ME -- AND I REALLY DIDN'T LEARN MUCH. OF THE ACTORS GETTING WAS DIFFERENT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE APPROACH IN GETTING -- MEN AND WOMEN ENGAGE IN EXPLORING THE FOUR STATES PROMOTION HAPPY SAID FAR FEAR AND ANGER -- WHICH IS AT THE CORE OF OUR CURRICULUM. OF THE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN A SAFE SPACE TO EXPLORE MOTION. OF THAT HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED FOR YEARS OR EVEN DECADES -- THESE EMOTIONS IF NOT HANDLED THE SAFE WAY SOMETIMES CAN TRIGGER. A REVERSAL AT YOUR REVERSIBLE EPISODES. OUR WORK PRODUCES PROFOUND BREAKTHROUGHS WITHOUT SINGLING ANYONE'S EXPERIENCE OUT THAT EVENTUALLY THIS WORK IS TRANSMITTED INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES. BECAUSE THE MENTAL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BODIES. EXPERIENCE THE MOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DORMANT FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS THE MAGIC OF THIS CLASS. AND I JUST WANNA SAY THAT A WHEN I TOOK THE CLASS THERE WAS NO FUNDING. FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO I DID EIGHT WEEKS THEY LEFT AND I DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR ABOUT A YEAR SO I STARTED MY OWN THEATRE COMPANY.

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF DOING THIS FOR EIGHT YEARS I HAVE SEEN? THAT THE BIGGEST COMPONENT THAT CREATES COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING IS THE STAFF OF CDC ARE YOU ASKED IF ON CITIES YOUR HAS THE CAPABILITY TO STAFF PROGRAMMING AND I THINK -- ON AN UPPER MANAGEMENT LEVEL ABSOLUTELY I STARTED TO SEE A HUGE SHIFT IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS -- WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IS TRAINING AT THE ACADEMY FOR THE CADETS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FACILITATING OPENING CELLS? MAKING SURE THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WANT TO CLASSES I THINK WHEN THAT HAPPENS. WE'LL SEE THE SHIP WILL BE IN FULL EFFECT THANK YOU. HI MY NAME'S DAVE MEASURE ON THE CEO OF A NONPROFIT CALLED THE CATALYST FOUNDATION IN LANCASTER CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE UP A LOT OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY AND HONESTLY YOU KNOW THE MOST POWERFUL THINGS THAT I SEE HAPPEN WITH ARE IN PRISON WORK. ON MORE IN THIRTEEN FACILITIES WERE NOT FUNDED FOR MOST OF THEM. I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN TEACHING CLASSES AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES COUNTY AT LANCASTER FOR SIXTEEN CONSECUTIVE YEARS EVERY SINGLE WEEK I'LL BE THERE TOMORROW. AND THE POWERFUL TRANSFORMATION THAT I SEE IN THE IN THE BEAUTIFUL INMATES WHO WHO HAVE THE GUTS TO LOOK INSIDE. AND EVALUATE THEMSELVES HONESTLY AND MAKE CHANGE IS IS IT'S AMAZING THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S GIVEN TO ON A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IS A PITTANCE. THERE'S NO MONEY TO DO ANY OF ALLEYWAY TIONS ARE STUDIES IT'S EXTREMELY LIMITED I THINK ON THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING A LOT OF REALLY GREAT THINGS WE SEE IT. AND WE ALSO SEE THINGS JUST AS WERE MENTIONED. GUYS CAN'T GET TO THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE AND FEEL LIKE RELEASING THE INMATES TO THE CLASS. THEN THERE DROP FROM THE FROM THE PSALMS LAST ON FROM THE FROM THE CLASS ROSTER. IF THEY MESS AND DON'T SHOW UP SO THERE ARE YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT THAT CAN BE MADE ON THE GROUND AS WELL -- I DO IT FOR SIXTEEN YEARS STRAIGHT BECAUSE I SEE THE CHANGE THAT HAPPENS IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND IT'S IT'S POWERFUL OTHERS. I KNOW RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW FOURTEEN GUYS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH DIRECTLY ALL GOT THEIR SENTENCES COMMUTED AND THE COMMENTS BY THE BOARD OF PAROLE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY TALK TO THEM IS LIKE. THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF TRAUMA IS REMARKABLE THANK YOU THANK YOU WERE. RATHER. DIFFICULT POINT AT THIS. LET ME JUST SIMPLY SAY IF YOU'RE ADDING ON TO WHAT THEY'VE SAID TRY TO LISTEN CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE WE WE GETTING THE MESSAGE THAT THE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE INADEQUATELY FUNDED. ARE AFFECTED PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT DOES NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE. AND THAT WE NEEDED TO REASSESS THAT SO I'M HOPING EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'VE HEARD THAT MANY MANY TIMES. I HOPE THE GENTLEMAN WHO'S TALL IN THE BACK [inaudible] AND AND EVERYBODY KNOWS WHO WE TALKING ABOUT OKAY SHOULDN'T BE ANY QUESTION OF SO I HOPE THAT'S THE LAST PERSON SO PEOPLE AREN'T STILL JUMPING INTO THE LINE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM. IT'S ARE ALMOST FIVE THIRTY RIGHT NOW SO PLEASE MAKE IT SHORT THANK YOU YES GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS EMILY HARRIS I'M WITH ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND I HAVE BEEN. VOLUNTEERING AND PRISONS AND JAILS FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN BOTH CALIFORNIA AND IN MICHIGAN AND I JUST WANTED. TO I WILL I WILL REEMPHASIZE THE PEACE AROUND I'M SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY A LEAD. TO A ORGANIZATIONS FOR LEADING PROGRAMS BUT I WANT TO REALLY TALK ABOUT -- WHAT YOU ALL COULD BE DOING TO CREATE A CULTURE AND AND A PLACE THAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED ISN'T JUST ABOUT RECIDIVISM THAT'S AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY INDICATOR OF A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM -- I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER PRO SOCIAL FACTORS ARE PEOPLE MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR FAMILIES ARE THERE DIFFERENT RACE RELATIONSHIPS IN THE PRISONS -- AND REALLY TALKING TO THE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN THERE YOU CAN FIND OUT THE BEST PROGRAMS BY TALKING TO FIVE PEOPLE ON EACH YARD YOU'LL KNOW WHICH ARE THE BEST PROGRAMS IN CDC ARE -- BUT I THINK ADDITIONALLY FOR CULTURE THE CULTURE AROUND -- THE PROGRAMMING IS AROUND LOCKDOWNS ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE ALLOWED INTO THE PRISON TO LEAD PROGRAMS ARE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO THEIR PARTICIPATION -- HOW ARE THE GUARDS TREATING THE VOLUNTEERS AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE FACTORS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA PROBABLY BE BETTER INDICATORS FOR YOU ESPECIALLY SINCE SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE? AND VALUABLE PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO NECESSARILY BE IT BE EVIDENCE BASE BUT I WOULD SAY. THE PERSON'S ALTERED AT SAN QUENTIN THEIR PROGRAMS THERE'S INCREDIBLE STUFF THERE AND SOME OF IT DIDN'T HAVE IT WASN'T AN EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM COMING IN BUT IT WAS A CREATIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY COMMITTED. AND I WOULD JUST HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU RESOURCE THAT TYPE OF WORK THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME'S ALEX THàNH I'M THE FOUNDER OF POLLS FOR LIFE. CANINE RESCUE LIKE MANY OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS POLLS FOR LIKE PROGRAMS KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER PROVIDING ACCESS TO HEALING AND TEACHING ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY WHILE PREPARING PEOPLE TO BE TENSE THEY COMMUNITY. WE DON'T JUST SAVE THE LIVES OF PRECIOUS ON TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFITS PROVIDING THE SINGLE MOST NEED TO TOOL WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM. QUALITY AND REHABILITATION OUR ORGANIZATIONS TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COMMUNITY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE FEEL LIKE THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE. BACK TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS WITH MORE SUSTAIN FUNDING. SO AND I THINK WITHOUT ALL THESE PROGRAMS YOU ALL WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WAKE TOGETHER AND CREATE THE PROGRAM AND THAT WILL BE ACTUALLY CREATING THAT I'M NOT THE RESULTS THAT WE HAVE TODAY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS DIANE WILD I'VE BEEN GOING INTO PRISON FOR SIXTEEN YEARS AND I AM REPRESENTING BUDDHIST PATHWAYS PRISON PROJECT OF A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON ALL OF THIS. BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A FIVE FATES POLICY BUDDHISM IS NOT ONE OF THE FACE THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY CDC ARE WE COME IN WITH OUR OWN EFFORTS WE HAVE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS COME TO OUR GROUP BECAUSE WERE NONTHEISTIC. IN WE DEAL WITH TRAUMA DALY MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION. AND AS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED WE GET SUCH GREAT RESULTS BECAUSE AS THE MEN SAY YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE HERE NOBODY'S PAYING YOU. BUT YOU CARE ABOUT US AND I THINK THAT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN ALL OF OUR PROGRAMMING WHEN PEOPLE HONESTLY REALLY CARE SO WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS IF WE DIDN'T HAVE SOME GRANTS. SOMETHING TO KEEP US GOING BECAUSE WE GO TO A LOT OF OUTLINED PRISONS WERE IN TWENTY TWO PRESENTS RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S A HUGE EFFORT TO TRY TO DO THIS FOR SMALL ORGANIZATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI THANKS FOR ON CONTINUING TO LISTEN TO THE PUBLIC MY NAME IS ANNA ON THEM WITH THE W. HEY WOOD BURNS INSTITUTE -- MORE BASED IN OAKLAND AND I JUST WANTED TO UP LEFT AND REITERATE SOMETHING THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR SOUSA AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LIKE EMILY JUST. STATED THAT THAT. WE REALLY SHOULDN'T JUST BE LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM AS ONLY METRIC OF SUCCESS -- WE'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE TALKING AS IN FAMILY ENGAGE MEN -- YOU SEE THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN THIS ROOM AMONG FOLKS WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT AND IF YOU'RE GONNA -- CONSIDER FINDING LONGITUDINAL STUDY THAT IS LOOKING AT COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS I WOULD REALLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER ENGAGING THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM AND THE CBO IS PROVIDING SERVICES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED AND NOT JUST IN BEING. SUBJECTS OF THE STUDY BUT IN DESIGNING THE STUDY SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY DESIGN A STUDY THAT LOOKS AT THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND DOESN'T JUST HONE IN ON RECIDIVISM. THANK YOU. I GET AFTERNOON CAITLYN DUNKLEY I AM THE COORDINATOR OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE PRISON IN PRISON WORK GROUP THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME THIS AFTERNOON. I JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS -- ARE THE RECENT R. F. P. PROCESS FOR THE INNOVATIVE GRANTS PROGRAMS WHICH GRANTED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR THE COMMUNITY GROUPS SOME OF WHOM YOU SEE IN THE ROOM. THERE IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF GRANT PROPOSALS PUT IN FROM COMMUNITIES COMMUNITY STAND READY TO CONTINUE TO CARRY THIS WORK. AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S MONEY LEFT ON THE TABLE THROUGH THE C. B. T. PROGRAMS COMMUNITIES ARE FIGHTING FOR THIS FOUR MILLION -- AND I REALLY WANNA ALSO ECHO THAT THE THIS IS THE RESULT OF COMMUNITY GROUPS WHAT YOU SEE HERE IN THE ROOM YOU SEE PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM PRISON. BEING EMPLOYED BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT. DURING THEIR TIME AND THIS IS REALLY THE KIND OF NETWORKING REENTRY BRIDGING THAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR I'M AND FINALLY JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT ONLY HAVING RECIDIVISM AS A METRIC IS NOT GOING TO GET US THE RESULTS IN TRUE I AND NOW THIS IS THAT WE NEED. SO CHALLENGE -- ALL OF US TO CONTINUE THE URGE TO PARTNER FOR AN OUTSIDE RESEARCH INTO TWO INSTITUTION AND TO LOOK BEYOND JUST THE METRIC OF RECIDIVISM FOR REALLY HOLISTIC PICTURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU. HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS GREG FEDERAL WITH INITIATE JUSTICE -- I WANT TO ECHO ALL THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TODAY AND YOU KNOW FOR THEIR WORK THE REQUEST FOR VERY MODEST SUM OF TEN MILLION TO EXPAND THESE PROGRAMS. I'M I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE THAT AS AN UNDERGRAD I SPENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AT SAN QUINTIN IN A SERVICE LEARNING PROJECT. AND ALL OF THE RESOURCE IS AN AMAZING PROGRAMS THERE -- YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD ALL THE EVIDENCE TODAY ALL THE ANECDOTAL RESEARCH OUT VERY HELPFUL AND VERY YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD WORK -- BUT THAT ALL THAT ALL THOSE PROGRAMS -- SHOULD NOT REALLY BE THE EXCEPTION THAT SHOULD BE THE NORM. UNLESS ONE TO LET THAT BE KNOWN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ITEMS INTO CONSIDERATION YEAH I WANTED -- TO BE AND WE'LL MOVE ON NEXT OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL BUT AS SOME OF YOU MAY BE LEAVING. I DON'T WANT TO DOWNPLAY THE IMPORTANCE OF I'M A METRIC OF RECIDIVISM -- BECAUSE IS IT. IT IS THE FINAL PRODUCT OF ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PERSON WHO IS WHOLE AGAIN WHO'S DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT GOT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAMILIES KNOWS THAT. THOSE THEN. CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR PERSON TO HAVE REDUCES THAT ABYSS IT DID NOT GO BACK INTO THE SAME LIFESTYLE THAT THEY ONCE WERE IN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE -- YOU ONLY HAVE ONE METRIC THAT MEET BASICALLY IS WE ARE TO REHABILITATE. IF WE ARE TO ONCE AGAIN GO BACK AND TRY TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE TRAUMA AND TO CREATE PERSONS WHO ARE HOLD AND PRODUCTIVE AND HAPPY AND WITH FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT IT'S REALLY THAT'S WHAT REHABILITATION IS ALL ABOUT ANDONE OF THE WAYS YOU LOOK AT IT IS DO THEY WANT TO GO BACK OR DO THEY GO BACK. INTO WHAT THEY'VE DONE BEFORE -- AND IS THE SCOPE BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A CYCLE OF PEOPLE GOING BACK IN AFTER BEING OUT AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE NOT DONE THE WORK. THAT THAT -- THAT WE NEED TO DO IT WILL FIND. AS WE CHANGE NOT JUST THE PUNISHMENT BUT TRULY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO TO HELP TO REBUILD LIVES. AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK RECIDIVISM IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T DEMONSTRATES TO US IN SOME WAY THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING PEOPLE STAY AWAY FROM THAT LIFESTYLE AND TO MOVE ON TO A NOTHER. LEVEL WHICH IS A DEALING WITH FAMILY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND THEMSELVES AND SO FORTH AND SO ON SO THAT'S WHY RECIDIVISM TO US IS IMPORTANT. AW AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OF MONEY ALWAYS BUT REALLY ABOUT REBUILDING LIVES AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO DO THAT THEN WE A BILL TATIAN. ONE OF THE WAYS WE MEASURE. OKAY AND ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT FACTORED INTO THAT. THIS IS NOT JUST GOING TO A PROGRAM AND COMING OUT AND NOT GOING BACK IT'S REALLY DEAL ITSELF AND MOST OF YOU'VE MENTIONED IT ONE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS OKAY. WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR OUR THIRD ITEM WHICH IS A THE LAST ONE WOULD EXPECT I'M SORRY WHAT IS THE STATE AND YOU COULD EVEN TRANSITION. BUT I JUST GO BACK TO SEE TO SEE ARE THE ONE THE ONE QUESTION IS THIS GET GIVEN THE THAT THE PUBLIC COMMENT. ARE THERE OTHER QUALITATIVE MEASURES I MEAN I KNOW WE FOCUS A LOT OF POLITICS QUALITATIVE AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH DOCTOR MEMBERS COMMENTS. BUT ARE THERE QUALITATIVE MEASURES AS PART OF THAT -- STUDY AND IF THERE ARE YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LATER YEAH I'VE I'VE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE QUALITATIVE MEASURES AND THAT'S PART OF THAT THE THE RECIDIVISM. AND HOLISTIC STUDY WE'RE LOOKING AT WE HAVE A MEETING WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS SPEAK WITHOUT CONVERSATION WILL BE FURTHER BECAUSE WE THINK THAT CULTURE CHANGESHAPPENING IN PRESENT AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRY MEASURE THAT AS WELL. WE ALSO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT TO DEVELOP PERFORMANCE METRICS -- FOR VARIETY OF KIND OF DIFFERENT GOALS WE WANTED TO SET. THANK YOU FOR IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE ITEMS THE TRIP THREE AND FOUR TOGETHER DEALS WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL -- AND I AM THREE BOOK INSPECTOR GENERAL GIVE US AN OVERVIEW AND THEN OBVIOUSLY OF WE WOULD OF WILL ALSO PROVIDE US WITH INFORMATION CONCERNED SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING THOSE WHO LEAVING THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INPUT. GOOD FOR YOU ALL AGAIN. NUMBER PUBLIC COMPANIES. KNOW IT. WELL DEPENDS ON YOUR INTEREST LEVEL. OKAY. ONE BEGIN YES GOOD EVENING I'M RIGHT WESLEY I'M THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRAND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME HERE TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. I'M PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION REGARDING MY AGENCY AND ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. I WILL FIRST PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF OUR CURRENT JURISDICTION. AND THEN SHIFT TO A REVIEW OF OUR LATEST REPORT ON THE SPECIAL REVIEW OF SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISONS PROCESSING. OF INMATE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. I PROVIDED YOU WITH TO HAND OUT TO COVER THESE AREAS ONE IS A QUICK REFERENCE ON WHAT WE DO AND THE SECOND IS A SUMMARY OF OUR REPORT. THIS AGENCY WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AS A SUBDIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS THE DUTIES WERE TO FORM SOME INVESTIGATIONS REVIEW POLICY AND PERFORM MANAGEMENT AUDITS MANAGEMENT REVIEW AUDITS. IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS REGARDING CONCERNS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. THE OFFICE WAS MOVED OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT AND WAS MADE AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY. WITH JURISDICTION FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT AT THAT TIME THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS GIVEN DISCRETION TO CONDUCT AUDITS. AND INVESTIGATIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL COURT IN THE MADRID CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THE O. I. G.'S JURISDICTION WAS EXPANDED. TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT'S INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINE PROCESS. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN LEGISLATION RESTRUCTURED THE FUNCTIONS OF THE AGENCY. THE RG BUDGET WAS CUT BY 45% AND OUR STAFFING WAS ALSO REDUCED BY ABOUT HALF. OUR DISCUSSION TO CONDUCT AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS WAS ELIMINATED AND OUR STATUTORY DUTIES WERE REDUCED. TO A DELINEATED LIST OF FUNCTIONS WHICH INCLUDED STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO PERFORMANCE SPECS SHINS OF THE PRISON MEDICAL SYSTEM. WE NOW PERFORM ONLY THE DUTIES DESCRIBED ON THE HANDOUT THAT I PROVIDED. AND WE HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO PERFORM OTHER OVERSIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT. TURNING TO THE SALINAS VALLEY REVIEW AGAIN ARE PROVIDED A SHORT SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. IN A RECENT CDC OUR CASE A FEDERAL JUDGE SUCCINCTLY DEFINED DUE PROCESS AS QUOTE GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE AIM OF DUE PROCESS IS PROTECTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL AGAINST ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT ACTIONS UNQUOTE. SOMEONE WHO'S INCARCERATED DOES NOT LOSE THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS SIMPLY AS A RESULT OF BEING IMPRISONED. OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS THERE'S BEEN CONCERNED BY STAKEHOLDERS. THAT INMATES HAVE NOT BEEN AFFORDED THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS CAN A MEANINGFUL MECHANISM TO BRING STAFF MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS FORWARD TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR RESOLUTION. IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MY OFFICE WAS APPROACHED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE PRISON LAW OFFICE. JOINTLY REQUESTING THAT THE OIG REVIEW THE END MAKE COMPLAINT PROCESS. ABSENT BEING INVITED IN. WHY'D YOU WOULD HAVE HAD NO JURISDICTION TO LOOK AT THIS PROCESS. HAVING COMPLETED OUR REVIEW WE HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER IN THIS AREA INCLUDING ANY ONGOING MONITORING OF THE DEPARTMENTS COMPLIANCE WITH ITS POLICIES. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT'S APPEALS INSTRUCTIONAL HANDBOOK THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF THE IN MAKE COMPLAINT PROCESS. IS TO ENSURE TIMELY RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS THAT SAME HANDBOOK ALSO NOTES. THAT STAFF MEMBERS DO RIGHTS PROCESS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS MUST BE PROTECTED AND THAT THE COMPLAINT REVIEW PROCESS ALSO FUNCTIONS. TO EXONERATE STAFF WHO'VE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED. OUR REVIEW OF THE PROCESS REVEALED A COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE HIGH LEVEL DUE PROCESS GOALS. AND THAT THE PROCESS APPEARS ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY THE PURPOSE TO EXONERATE STAFF. WE ALSO NOTED THE DEPARTMENT KNEW ABOUT MANY OF THE FAILURES OF THIS PROCESS AS EARLY AS TWO YEARS BEFORE OUR REVIEW. WHEN THEY CONVENE A WARDENS ADVISORY GROUP TO LOOK AT IT? WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF ANY ACTION TAKEN BEING TAKEN BY MANAGEMENT ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE WARDS ADVISORY GROUP PRIOR TO OUR REVIEW. FOR OUR REVIEW WE MONITOR ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT INMATE COMPLAINTS OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD. WE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED SIXTY ONE COMPLAINTS IN WHICH THE INQUIRIES WERE DONE BY THE PRISON. FOR THE PERIOD DECEMBER ONE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THROUGH FEBRUARY 222-820-0018. THESE WERE PAPER REVIEWS. OF WORKED AT IT ALREADY BEEN CONDUCTED. WE ALSO MONITORED IN PERSON ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN INCREASED THE PRISON INITIATED FROM MARCH. ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THROUGH MAY. THIRTY ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I SHOULD NOTE THAT WE PERFORMED OUR REVIEW UNDER SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTION WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE PRESENT DURING INTERVIEWS WITH OFFICERS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY WERE SUBJECT TO THE COMPLAINT ARE SIMPLY WITNESSES. WE HAD NO VISIBILITY IN THIS MAJOR AREA OF THE PROCESS. DURING OUR ONSITE MONITORING PERIOD WE WERE PRESENT FOR ALL OTHER INTERVIEWS WHEN WE WERE NOTIFIED. THERE WERE A FEW INTERVIEWS THAT WE MISSED BECAUSE OUR STAFF BECAUSE THE STAFF CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY NEGLECTED TO NOTIFY US. FORTUNATELY THAT WAS NOT COMMON. AFTER COLLECTING ALL OF OUR DATA THROUGH MONITORING WE ANALYZED OUR FINDINGS AND USED A STANDARDIZED SET OF SIX ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS TO ARRIVE AT OUR CONCLUSIONS. THOSE ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS ARE FOUND ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT. PLEASE NOTE THAT WHILE WE LOOKED AT THE DEPARTMENTS AND HEARINGS TO ITS POLICY. WE ALSO USED PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIVE STANDARDS TO JUDGE THE ADEQUACY OF THE IN CORY'S WHEN THERE WAS NO POLICY ON POINT. IN MOST INSTANCES. THERE WAS NO POLICY TO GUIDE OFFICERS AND HOW TO PROPERLY CONDUCT THE INQUIRY. IF THERE WAS A POLICY WE CONSIDERED WHETHER IN OUR OPINION THE POLICY WAS APPROPRIATE. BASED ON OUR DATA WE MADE FINDINGSAND DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS AND CORRECT THEIR SHORTCOMINGS. WE FOUND THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE PROCESS NOT PROVIDE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL PARTIAL INQUIRY INTO THE AND MAKE COMPLAINTS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AS NOTED ABOVE THE PROCESS FUNCTIONALLY ACTS TO PROTECT STAFF FROM THOSE ALLEGATIONS. OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT STAFF COMPLAIN INCREASE WE EXAMINED. ONE I'M COREY BEGAN THE PROCESS. BUT WAS SENT TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS PRIOR TO THE PRISON COMPLETING THE INQUIRY. THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS OPEN THE CASE AND INTERVIEWED THE SUBJECT AND RETURN THE CASE TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY. NO VIOLATIONS OF POLICY WERE FOUND IN THAT CASE. IN FIVE OTHER INSTANCES FOLLOWING THE INQUIRY THE HIRING AUTHORITY FOUND A VIOLATION OF POLICY. IN THE FIVE THAT COMPLETED THE LOCAL PROCESS WERE POLICY VIOLATIONS WERE FOUND. TRAINING WAS ORDERED AND FOUR OF THE CASES IN A LETTER OF INSTRUCTION WAS ISSUED AND ONE THAT ONE PERSON RECEIVED HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTION TIMELY. IN THE FOUR CASES WERE TRAINING WAS ORDERED. FOR THREE OF THE CASES TRAINING HEARD WHEN OUR OFFICE CREED THE INSTITUTION FOR THE TRAINING RECORDS APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS AFTER WE HAD BEEN ON SITE. TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED ON THE DAY WE ASK FOR THE RECORDS. IN ONE CASE ALTHOUGH THE HIRING AUTHORITY FOUND A VIOLATION OF POLICY. NO OFFICERS WERE IDENTIFIED SO NO TRAINING WAS PROVIDE. WE FOUND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE OF THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT CASES THAT'S 92% OF THE CASES THAT WE REVIEWED. WE FOUND THE ENTIRE INQUIRY WAS INADEQUATE AND THE RESULTS UNRELIABLE FOR DECISION MAKING AND A HUNDRED AND FOUR CLICK COMPLAINTS AND THAT'S 55% OF THE CASES. THE DEFICIENCIES INCLUDED POOR INTERVIEWING SKILLS POR EVIDENCE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES AND REPORT WRITING SKILLS. WE MONITORED SIXTY ONE DIFFERENT OFFICERS WHO CONDUCTED THESE INCREASE AND FOUND THAT NOT ONE HAD MEANINGFUL TRAINING FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND HOW TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION. MOREOVER WE FOUND THOSE WHO CONDUCTED THE INCREASE FOR THE MOST PART DID NOT FOLLOW SOUND INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES. NOR DID THEY PROPERLY GATHER EVIDENCE OR PREPARE REASON AND LOGICAL REPORTS. WE ALSO DIRECTLY OBSERVED ABUSES IN THE INQUIRY PROCESS WHERE THE REVIEWERS WERE ARGUMENTATIVE WITH THE COMPLAINTS. DID NOT COLLECT A REPORT CORROBORATING EVIDENCE AND DISCOURAGED INMATES FROM GOING FORWARD WITH THE COMPLAINTS. NONE OF THE INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED SO THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE INTERVIEW. WHERE -- I G. WAS NOT PRESENT TO OBSERVE. FINALLY WE FOUND THAT THE INCREASE ON THE WHOLE WERE NOT INDEPENDENT. WE FOUND IN CORY'S WERE SUBORDINATES WERE INVESTIGATING AND MAKE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICERS. INCREASE THAT WERE CONDUCTED BY OFFICERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO THE COMPLAINT. AN INCREASE CONDUCTED BY OFFICERS WHO ARE CLOSE COWORKERS OF THE SUBJECTS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE ENCOURAGE WERE NOT KEPT CONFIDENTIAL GIVING RISE TO CONCERNS ABOUT RETALIATION AGAINST THOSE WHO COMPLAINED BY THE SUBJECTS OF THE COMPLAINTS. WE FOUND NO TRUE CRITICAL OVERSIGHT OF THE PROCESS BY PRISON MANAGERS AND LEADERS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING DECISIONS. OFTEN THE ULTIMATE REVIEWER SIMPLY RUBBER STAMPED THE CONCLUSION OF THE OFFICER CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY. INSTEAD OF MAKING A THOUGHTFUL DECISION BASED ON THE FACTS PRESENTED. IN FACT WE BELIEVE HAD THE ULTIMATE DECISION MAKER CRITICALLY CONSIDERED THE INFORMATION THEY WERE GIVEN. THEY WOULD HAVE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION WE REACHED NAMELY THAT THE INCREASE FOR SO FLAWED. THAT NO CONCLUSION COULD BE JUSTIFIED. BASED ON THE SEVERE AND PERVASIVE ISSUES WE FOUND WE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATION AND THAT LIST IS AT PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT. AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE WE BELIEVE THE INSTITUTION THAT -- CORRECTION SHOULD RE ASSIGNED THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT IN MAKE COMPLAINT ENQUIRIES OUTSIDE THE PRISONS COMMAND STRUCTURE. THEY SHOULD ADOPT A REGIONALIZED MODEL FOR STAFFING PURPOSES AS THEY DO FOR THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THEY SHOULD PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE AND ONGOING TRAINING FOR ALL STAFF WHO PERFORM ENQUIRIES. THEY SHOULD CONSIDER CERTIFICATION FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING FOR THOSE CONDUCTING THE INCREASE AND A SIGNED IN. A SIGN INCREASED ONLY TO THOSE STAFF WHO. THEY SHOULD REQUIRE AUDIO RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS OF SUBJECT TO WITNESS. THE DEPARTMENT PROVIDED A RESPONSE TO OUR REPORT. THE RESPONSE NOTES THAT THEY DO NOT DISPUTE THE FACTS THAT WE PROVIDE. THEY ALSO AGREE THAT THERE MAY BE SIMILAR ISSUES PRESENT AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A DETAILED PLAN FOR HOW THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE IDENTIFIED. WE WERE PROVIDED AN EARLY DRAFT AND I EMPHASIZE THIS IS AN EARLY DRAFT. OF PROPOSED POLICY TO SLIGHTLY REORGANIZE THE APPEALS PROCESS WITH THE HEADQUARTERS REVIEW HAD IT. THE DEPARTMENT ADVISED US THAT HEADQUARTERS WOULD REVIEW CASES WHERE THE INMATE DISAGREES WITH THE FINDING OF THE REVIEWER. WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS APPROACH DOES NOT REMEDY THE ABUSES THAT WE OBSERVE WHERE CORROBORATING EVIDENCE WAS OMITTED FROM THE FINAL REPORT AND BIASED QUESTIONS WERE PRESENTED. IN THE ABSENCE OF A RECORDED INTERVIEW OR BEING PRESENT TO OBSERVE THE INTERVIEW WE BELIEVE THERE'S NO WAY TO AUDIT WHETHER THE REVIEWERS PROPERLY PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE WITH THE DEPARTMENT REGARDING THE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT. COME FROM THE PRISON LAW OFFICE DON SPECTER [inaudible] IN READ. OKAY HI MY NAME IS BELOW ME -- AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE PRISON LAW OFFICE THE PRISON LAW OFFICE IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED. IN STATE PRISONS COUNTY JAILS IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES AND JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. ONE OF OUR CASES AGAINST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS CALLED ARMSTRONG IT'S ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE NINTH CIRCUIT DESCRIBED THE CASE AS QUOTE ALL WITH CALIFORNIA STATE OFFICIALS. OVER WHETHER DEFENDANTS MUST PROVIDE DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDING BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE FOR DISABLED PRISONERS. AS PART OF THAT CASE WE VISITED SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON TWELVE SEPARATE TIMES OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY FOUR DAYS ON SITE. CONDUCTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN CLIENT INTERVIEWS. AND WE RECEIVED OVER TWELVE HUNDRED LETTERS FROM MY CLIENTS THERE BUT ISSUES RELATED TO ARMSTRONG. WE THEN REPORTED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. THAT STAFF MISCONDUCT INCLUDED EVERYTHING FROM EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TO HARASSMENT AND VERBAL ABUSE TO RACISM. TO RETALIATION AND INTERFERING WITH THE APPEALS PROCESS. WE SAW NO OR VERY FEW IMPROVEMENTS IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD MISCONDUCT. ALL TOO OFTEN THE DEPARTMENT MINIMIZED OR DISMISSED THE REPORTS AND PROVIDED VERY LITTLE INFORMATION TO US. THE SYSTEM APPEAR DESIGNED TO DISCREDIT THE VICTIMS OF ABUSE BEHIND BARS. IT BECAME INCREASINGLY APPARENT TO US THAT THE STOCK COMPLAINT PROCESS WAS FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN. WE AND OUR CLIENTS STARTED TO WITHHOLD ALLEGATIONS. BECAUSE WE WERE NOT CONFIDENT THAT THEY WOULD BE MEANINGFUL INVESTIGATED. WE ALSO THOUGHT THERE WAS A REAL POSSIBILITY THAT OUR CLIENTS WOULD BE RETALIATED AGAINST. INCLUDING THROUGH PHYSICAL ABUSE. I WANT TO GIVE JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT I THINK SORT OF PORTRAYS THE SITUATION WE WERE ON IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN A TRANSGENDER WOMAN WHO USED A WHEELCHAIR WAS FOUND DEAD. IN HER CELL. SHE WAS IN HER UNDERWEAR WAS AROUND HER ANKLES HER GENITALIA WERE EXPOSED. AND A PENCIL SHOVED IN HER EAR. INTO THE POST MORTEM REPORT HER QUOTE HEAD WAS NEAR ELECTRICAL OUTLET AND THE PENCIL WAS FASHIONED. INTO ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE EMERGING HERE. POST MORTEM EXAMINATION REVEALED THE PENCIL TO TRAVEL VERTICALLY THROUGH HER LEFT EAR AND UNDER THE JAW FOR EMBEDDING IN THE ADJACENT MAC. LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT ELECTROCUTION COULD BE THE CAUSE OF DEATH IF THE PENCIL HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE ELECTRICAL OUTLET. THE CORONER COULD NOT DETERMINE A CAUSE OF DEATH. WE AT THE PRISM OFFICE STARTED TO HEAR FOR OUR CLIENTS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS TOOK PLACE MANY HAD SEEN WHAT HAD HAPPENED. HAD HEARD WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY AND SAID THAT STOCKTON THE UNIT HAD PURPOSELY LEFT KNOWING THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS WOMAN. OUR CLIENTS HOWEVER WOULD NOT LET US REPORT IT BECAUSE THEY SAID THE STAFF MISCONDUCT PROCESS WAS SO BROKEN. THAT THEY COULD NOT TELL WHETHER WOULD BE MEANINGFUL INVESTIGATED OR WHETHER THEY WOULD FACE RETALIATION. WE IN CITIES THEIR LEADERSHIP KNEW THAT UNLESS SERIOUS ACTION WAS TAKEN. IN RESPONSE TO OUR CONCERNS WE WOULD END UP IN COURT. THEN SECRETARY KERN AND WE AGREED TO HAVE THE EIICHI CONDUCTOR OF YOU TO AVOID THAT TIME. THE O. I. G.'S REVIEW WAS THOROUGH OBJECTIVE ACCURATE. NEITHER WE NOR THE DEPARTMENT DISPUTE THE O. I. G.'S FINDINGS. THOUGH I JEEZ REVIEW CONFIRMS WHAT WE HAVE REPORTED OVER A YEAR AGO. AND IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES BUT WE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT OR THAT WE HAD MERELY SUSPECTED. IT IS CLEAR AN UNDISPUTED NOW THAT SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE ARE NOT BEING MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSED BY THE DEPARTMENT. AGAIN THAT THE AG REVIEW WAS GREAT IT GIVES A LOT OF STATISTICS AND DATA BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE. AND IT'S WE HAD REPORTED MY OFFICE HAD REPORTED THAT STAFF TRIED TO FORCE ONE OF OUR CLIENTS AN ELDERLY BLACK MAN WHO IS A FULL TIME WHEELCHAIR USER. OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR INTO A STANDING HOLDING CAGE IN A SECLUDED LOCATION. THEY REPORTEDLY PULLED HIM FROM HIS WHEEL CHAIR AND SLAMMED HIM ONTO THE GROUND. OUR CLIENT REPORTED THAT THE OFFICERS QUOTE SLAMMED MY HEAD WITH FORCED TO THE GROUND AND PUMMELED ME. THEY BEGAN KICKING AND PUNCHING WHILE I WAS BASED ON THE GROUND WITH HANDCUFFS ON ONE OFFICER SAT ON MY FEET AND LEGS. AND ANOTHER HAD HIS KNEE ON MY NECK AND BACK WITH HIS BODY WEIGHT WHILE THE OTHERS KEPT. THOUGH I G. FOUND THE DEPARTMENT'S REVIEW OF OUR CLIENT'S ALLEGATIONS TO BE INADEQUATE. AMONG OTHER THINGS THE REVIEWER FAILED TO INTERVIEW TWO OF THE OFFICERS ALLEGEDLY INVOLVED IN THE ALTERCATION. AND DID NOT ADEQUATELY SUMMARIZE OUR CLIENTS STATEMENTS IN THE WRITTEN REPORT. FURTHERMORE ALTHOUGH THE REVIEWER IDENTIFIED A VIOLATION POLICY THE REVIEWER FAILED TO TAKE ADEQUATE STEPS TO DETERMINE WHICH STAFF MEMBER HAD VIOLATED THAT POLICY. IN ORDER TO AVOID FURTHER LITIGATION THE ID'S RECOMMENDATIONS NEED TO BE ADOPTED. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT WILL COST MONEY BUT IT IS CRITICAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND CERTAINLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A LAWSUIT. THE FEDERAL COURT IN ARMSTRONG ORDERED CDC ARE OVER SEVEN YEARS AGO. TO DEVELOP QUOTE AND EFFECTIVE INTERNAL OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROCEDURE TO THIS DAY. THEY HAVE NOT YET DONE SO. THE O. I. G.'S THOUGHTFUL RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING I QUOTE COMPLETE OVERHAUL OF THE STAFF COMPLAINING FOR PROCESS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED IMMEDIATELY. WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF REVIEWER INDEPENDENCE AND BIAS AGAINST OUR CLIENTS. SOME RESPECT IT'S LIKE THE FOX GUARDING THE HEN HOUSE THE REVIEWERS ARE INVESTIGATING THEIR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS HE CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN NEUTRAL. THOUGH I DO YOU FOUND THE QUOTE REVIEWERS DEMONSTRATED THEIR BIAS IN FAVOR OF THEIR CO WORKERS AND AGAINST INMATES AND QUOTE FREQUENTLY COMPROMISE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE REVIEW PROCESS. POTENTIALLY EXPOSING INMATES TO RETALIATION FOR FILING A COMPLAINT. TOP OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS PROCESS APPEARS TO WORK REASONABLY WELL BUT SO FEW ALLEGATIONS MADE IT THAT FAR. THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT MOST THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS ARE BEING DONE BY THE I A THE I A IS ON A SEPARATE TRACK THAT DOES NOT REYES INDEPENDENCE CONCERNS. OF THE INVESTIGATORS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN TRAINING HIRING AND PROMOTIONAL LADDER. IN ADDITION TO THE O. I. G.'S RECOMMENDATIONS CAMERAS MUST BE INSTALLED AT SALINAS VALLEY AND OTHER PRISONS. OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT THAT MY OFFICE REPORTED AFTER TWO HOURS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWO ALLEGATIONS CAME BACK SHE HATED. THAT MEANS THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT TELL WHETHER THAT MISCONDUCT HAD OR HAD NOT OCCURRED. THAT SHOULD WERE YOU. IT MEANS THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT STAFF COMMITTED SERIOUSNESS CONTACT TWO HUNDRED AND TWO TIMES WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT. IMPROVING INVESTIGATIONS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP BUT IT IS JUST THAT A FIRST STEP. EVEN THEN MANY ALLEGATIONS WILL BE HE SAID HE SAID SITUATIONS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE TOLD GUILTY PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE AND TO EXONERATE OFFICERS. IS TO HAVE CAMERAS IN THE INSTITUTION. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT -- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS DONE TO REVIEWS AT THAT WE'VE FINISHED TO HELP TO INITIATE. ONE WAS THROUGH -- THE REQUEST THAT WE PUT WHETHER WE REQUESTED FROM THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE OF HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON THAT WHERE THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH LEVEL OF ABUSE -- AND THE OTHER ONE WAS OF JUST HEARD -- IN BOTH CASES. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OBJECTIVE REVIEW -- ALLOWED US TO HAVE US SET OF FACTS WHICH BOTH PARTIES THE DEPARTMENT AND US. COULD RELY ON AND IN BOTH CASES WELL IN THE HIGH DESERT CASE. THEY TOOK. A LOT OF REMEDIAL MEASURES THAT WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING CONTROL OF THE ABUSE THAT WAS OCCURRING AT THAT PRISON -- AS INSPECTOR GENERAL WESLEY JUST SAID HE CANNOT DO THOSE REVIEWS ON HIS OWN HE HAS TO AT THE MOMENT HE HAS TO GET. PERMISSION FROM ME THE THE SPEAKER OR THE PRESIDENT THE SENATE IN ORDER TO DO THAT. THOSE REVIEWS AND WE BELIEVE THAT AS A WELL WE KNOW THAT WAS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE THINK THAT AMENDMENT SHOULD BE REPEALED SO THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AT HIS DISCRETION. OR HER DISCRETION CAN -- INITIATE A REVIEW AND SAVE THE STATE FROM SIMILAR LAWSUITS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO GET ACT INFORMATION THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS AND SINCE WE KNOW THAT THEY BOTH PARTIES KNOW THAT% THEY DO SUCH AN OBJECTIVE -- REVIEW. IT WOULD -- I THINK. A SAVE THE STATE MONEY AND ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO TO FUNCTION IN A MUCH MORE CONSTITUTIONAL MANNER AT SOME PLACES THAN THEY ARE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AS LA -- RESPONDING. ANYTHING LATER TOMORROW WITH THE BUDGET AND THIS OFFICE WE DIDN'T -- ANALYZE THIS POLICY AREA ALL RIGHT SOUNDS. IS THE CD ARE HAVE A RESPONSE. YES WILL. LET THEM TAKE YOUR SEATS IF EARLIER. FOR YOUR HAVE A RESPONSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN. SINCE THE SALINAS VALLEY REPORT I I DO NEED TO SAY THAT -- PRIOR TO THE REPORT BEING INITIATED WE WERE IN CONVERSATION HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALLEGING. WE MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH -- I. G. ABOUT SALINAS VALLEY DURING SALINAS VALLEY IN EVEN POST SALINAS VALLEY ON HOW WE CAN COME TO A REMEDY IN ADDRESS IS VERY SERIOUS ISSUES AND CONCERNS. THE CASES THAT WERE SIDE BY THE PLO WE ARE AWARE OF THEM. WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THEM THEY HAVE BEEN A PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT AND PART OF OUR INVESTIGATORY PROCESS. REALLY THE THE OVERSIGHT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN I JUST NEED TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AND JUST STATE EVERY SERIOUS INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED ON THE INSTITUTION THE O. I. G. HAS NOTIFIED -- SO THE INCIDENTS OCCUR ALL AGES NOTIFIED IF CASES ARE OPEN UP AN INVESTIGATORY PROCESS THEY FOLLOW THAT PROCESS THROUGH IF THEY ARE MONITORED AND SELECTED BY THE IG. I THINK WHAT -- MISTER WESLEY COMPLAINT PROCESS ITSELF. IS THE INQUIRY PROCESS THAT LEADS UP TO A DETERMINATION WHETHER IN A BAG AN INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO OCCUR. WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE AGREE THAT COULD. CASES LIKE -- MISTER SPECTER THE PLO AN ORGY BRINGS FORWARD WE TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY. WE DO -- WE DO NEED TO SAY THOUGH THAT -- AS A PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE WE DO AGREE THAT THE STAFF COMPLAIN PROCESS DOES NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE PRISON ITSELF. WE DO NEED TO HAVE -- THE INVESTIGATORS A THE TRAIN THE STAFF SO THEY CAN DO INDEPENDENT INCREASE ON THEIR OWN OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON SETTING -- WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO A PILOT OF THAT AT FIFTEEN INSTITUTIONS -- WE HAVE THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT CONDUCTING THOSE. THERE IS A TRAINING COMPONENT THAT GOES INTO THAT -- INTO THAT PIECE WHICH THAT TRAINING IS NOW BEING CONDUCTED THAT IS BEING POST CERTIFIED AND WE REMOVE THOSE STEPHANOPOULOS THEM UNDER. THE DIVISION OF OVERSIGHT AND RESEARCH -- THAT SITS WITHIN THE FIFTH FLOOR THE PROBLEM TO CORRECTION BUT IT IS WITH IN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS ARENA -- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT IF WE WANT TO DO THIS -- EFFECTIVELY AND WE WANT TO DO THIS STATEWIDE WITH SOME EFFICACY AND TRAINING -- WE HAVE RECOGNIZE THAT ANY CHANGES THAT THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO COME THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT ARE GONNA HAVE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. BECAUSE I DO NEED TO STATE THAT WE DO HAVE THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE STANDARD APPEAL PROCESS. AND THE STAFF THAT TRADITIONALLY DID THE STAFF COMPLAIN PRIVATE STAFF COMPLAINTS WERE. ASSIGNED SUPERVISORY SERGEANTS AND LIEUTENANTS JUST THROUGHOUT THE PRISON THEY WERE ASSIGNED BASED ON AVAILABILITY. THE APPEALS PROCESS WERE DONE BY STAFF -- THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO THE APPEALS OFFICE. AND THEY DID THE DAY TODAY APPEALS WHERE THEY MAY BE APPEALING -- CREDIT ISSUES TELEVISION BROKEN ISSUES OR LOWER LEVEL APPEALS BUT WHAT WE FIND IS. IF WE PULL THOSE STAFF THE APPEALS THERE'S A RESOURCE ISSUE IN THOSE ISSUE STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO TRYING TO FIND THE RESOURCES TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE STAFF COMPLAINT HAD HAS BEEN CHALLENGING. WE WERE ABLE TO FIND -- REALLOCATE THE POSITIONS INTERNALLY WITHIN THE PILLS PROCESS -- FROM INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE LOWER LEVELS APPEALS WE CANNOT SIGN THEM SO FUNDAMENTALLY WE AGREED WITH THE O. I. G. IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE MAJORITY OF THEM. THERE ARE A FEW THAT WE DO THAT STILL NEED TO HAVE FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ON NOW THERE ARE -- LABOR IMPLICATIONS WITH THE UNIONS WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING STAFF UNDER TAPE RECORDER. THAT FALLS MORE INTO THE FULL -- INTERNAL AFFAIRS PIECE THERE ARE POBRE CONCERNS WITH THAT -- BUT WITH I THINK IT'S A WHOLE. WE FUNDAMENTALLY AGREE AND I WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ROLE AND I ABOUT THIS BUT IT DOES COME WITH A RESOURCE ISSUE. AND SO IN TOTAL WE ARE LOOKING SO AND IN INTERNALLY WE HAVE TO LOOK INTERNALLY HOW WE CAN STRUCTURE THIS WE CAN AFFECTIVELY. ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND IF THERE IS A RESOURCE ASK AT WE WOULD HAVE TO BRIDGE SENSE SOMETHING MORE TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESSING THE ISSUES BUT THE WHOLE TIME. COMMUNICATING WITH THE IG TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ASKING FOR THE CORRECT THING BUT AT THIS POINT. TO COME AND ASK FOR ANY RESOURCES WITHOUT GETTING IN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION BE PREMATURE. BUT I KNOW THAT -- THE FIFTEEN STAFF THAT ARE OUT COMPLAINTS OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION THEMSELVES. UNDER THE DIVISION OF OVERSIGHT RESEARCH ACCOUNTABILITY. AND WE ARE ALREADY FINDING THAT -- THAT IS OUR TO BECOMING BURDEN SOME JUST BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF STAFF COMPLAINTS I DO NEED TO SAY THE SALINAS VALLEY IS. IS NOT LIKE THE OTHER THIRTY FOUR INSTITUTIONS IT IS A HIGHER LEVEL INSTITUTION. OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT DO COME OUT OF THERE -- ARE VERY CONCERNING JUST LIKE THE RIGHT HIGH DESERT BUT I CAN SAY. EVEN WORKING WITH THE AND YOU WITH HIGH DOES IT WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE SOME SYSTEMATIC CHANGES THAT I DESERT FIRST OF ALL BY LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN AT HIGH DESERT. WELL WE HAD THE SAME THING THAT SALINAS VALLEY WE HAD LEADERSHIP CHANGES THERE. WE HAD STAFF GOING INTO FOCUS TRAINING WITH HEADQUARTERS STAFF IN THE INSTITUTIONS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ISSUES ARE NOT BEING SWEPT IN THE RUNS THAT WE ARE DRESSED INAPPROPRIATELY. I THINK HOLISTICALLY TO HAVE THE TROOPS HELLO IS LOOKING FOR IT WILL TAKE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT THE TRUE CHANGE BECAUSE OF THE STAFFING AND TRAINING -- WE NEED TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE WORK OR MAKING THE RIGHT REQUESTS. YOU KNOW WHEN I READ THIS IS SOUND LIKE A NIGHTMARE -- SOUND LIKE EVERY. PRISON MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. WHAT WITH PEOPLE WITH REAL ISSUES REAL COMPLAINTS AND A HIGH LEVEL INTIMIDATION EVERYBODY'S KIND OF FEEDING INTO THE SAME? STORY AND NOBODY'S BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND SO RELEASED IT SOUNDS VERY -- READ THIS FIRST OF ALL I MEAN JUST IN. TERMS OF BASIC THINGS THAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN IN AN ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION YOU KNOW YOU NORMALLY EVEN. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO HAVE PIERCED EVALUATE EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY HAVE AND AND SO THEREFORE YOU BUILD A SYSTEM THAT KIND OF FEEDS ON ITSELF IN IN SOME WAY AND AS A RESULT. THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND THEY BECOME EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THEY BECOME MORE PROTECTED SO AS I WAS READING THIS AND AS I HAD HAVE TO MOTHER MEETINGS WITH INDIVIDUALS IT BECAME. I REALLY WAS I MEAN IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE MOVIE OF OF OF THE GREATEST VIEW YOU HAVE ALWAYS IN LIFE IS ONE IS GOING TO PRISON. AND THEN BEING CAPTIVE THERE WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T SEEM TO TREAT YOU FAIRLY AND THEN YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN. EXPRESS YOURSELF BECAUSE THIS HIGH LEVEL AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO WHEN I READ THIS IS JUST LIKE WHOA AND THEN I ASKED DO WE HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF FROM THE THE FROM. OF CDC ARE WITH YOU YOU SAY IS GOING TAKE RESOURCES ISTHINGS BE MOVES AWAY I DON'T SEE A PROPOSAL NECESSARY TO FUND THIS BUT TO ME THIS IS CRISIS AYE AYE MAYBE IT'S NOT IN IN. MAY BECAUSE I I YOU KNOW AND I I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF PRISONS WOULDN'T MAYBE IT'S THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE NOT A CRISIS. FOUGHT TO THOSE WHO ON THE OUTSIDE BUT TO ME TO THINKING THAT I WITH OUR WORK IN THE INSIDE AND CAPTIVE. AND HAVE ALL OF MY RIGHTS KIND OF JUST TRAMPLED ON IN A DE HUMANIZE IN SOME WAYS AND HAVE LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS THAT I CAN'T EXPRESS AND I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY THAT BECAUSE THEN THERE'S RETALIATION AND YOU DON'T GET THIS YOU DON'T GET THAT IN. YOUR FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT COMING DEAL WITH PEOPLE. IS THAT THAT IS FRIGHTENING TO THINK THAT THAT THAT THERE IS A REPORT THAT WE HAVE THAT ALMOST MIRRORS -- SOME OF THESE MOVIES A WE SEE THAT I'VE SEEN -- THAT REALLY TALK ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORKINGS OF OF OF OF INCARCERATED -- INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF THE PRISONS AND AND THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ONE EXPRESS THEMSELVES OR HAVE THEMSELVES FAIRLY HEARD OR WHATEVER MAY BE SO I'M CONCERNED AT THAT WE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANYTHING THAT SAYS THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I'M EQUALLY CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN X. WHAT INVESTIGATE THESE THINGS I ME INSPECTOR GENERAL IS IN THESE PRISONS MORE THAN ALL OF US THERE IN ALL THE TIME AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY UNLESS SOMEBODY ASKED THEM. AND BY THE TIME THEY GET ASKED THE PROBLEM IS IS IS HORRIBLE I MEAN IT IS ESCALATED TO THE POINT THAT THE SPEAKER OR THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE GOVERNOR NOW IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. WHEN IT GETS TO THAT LEVEL IT HAS REALLY GONE BEYOND WHERE IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE THESE KINDS OF ISSUES SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ON AN ONGOING BASIS? IN TERMS OF STRUCTURE AND AND PROGRAMS AND ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION AND ALL THIS KIND OF THING SO. I READ THIS WITH WITH WITH GREAT ALARM I MEAN IT WAS LIKE A NIGHTMARE TO READ THIS AND AND THEN TO TALK TO PEOPLE AND HAVE FOLKS SAY YEAH THAT'S TRUE. IT OUT OF AND AND IT'S GONNA TAKE RESOURCES TO CHANGE IT -- WHICH IS TRUE BUT I DON'T SEE A REQUEST FOR THE RESOURCES SO I DON'T REALLY SEE THE THE REAL SERIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHANGE MAYBE IT IS SAID MAYBE THIS SEASON SO COME FROM US. IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEAL WITH RESOURCES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE HOW WE DEAL WITH AN INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO HAS IT DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO OUT WAS THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. WAS DEMAND YOU KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF PRISONS THAT THEY WOULD BE THE PERSON WHO'S IN THERE ALL THE TIME AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS AND IF THERE WAS CORRUPTION IT WOULD BE BECAUSE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS NOT DOING HIS JOB. BUT NOW THAT I DISCOVERED THAT WE HAVE A NEUTER THIS AT TWO GENERAL IN SOME WAY TO NOT BE ABLE TO MONITOR THIS SYSTEM THAT WE REALLY NEED MONITORING UP. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE KINDS OF NIGHTMARES THAT ISIS CEILING TV MOVIES WOULD SAYING SAYING PRISON OR WHATEVER IT WAS. IT MAKES ME VERY VERY CONCERNED VERY CONCERNED AND OBVIOUSLY SINCE IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED. IN REQUEST THAT I SEE IT BUT NOT ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE. MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS I I THINK FIRST OF ALL ONE ECHO. THE COMMENTS FROM MISTER DE AS THAT THIS. THIS THE THESE FINDINGS IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT ARE VERY FIVE VERY TROUBLING WE WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES. THAT -- URGENTLY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED -- WE THANKED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ON THE PLO FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION -- AS MISTER DE AS INDICATED WE ARE EVALUATING THE PASSED OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ARE IT IS LIKELY TO REQUIRE SOME RESOURCES [inaudible] AND WE ABSOLUTELY THANK THAT IF IT DOES REQUIRE RESOURCES WE WILL BE PROVIDING THOSE RESOURCES THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT THERE ARE REALLY SORT OF TWO POINTS IN TIME THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COMES FORWARD WITH REQUESTS IN THE BUDGET -- THE FIRST BEING THE JANUARY BUDGET ON THE SECOND BEING. AT MAY REVISE. RIGHT THIS REPORT CAME OUT I THINK RIGHT AFTER THE RE RELEASE OF THE JANUARY BUDGET AND THAT IS WHY THERE WERE NO RESOURCES REQUESTED AS PART OF THE BUDGET -- IN TERMS OF THE TIMING HERE WE ARE AS I SAID EVALUATING OPTIONS AND WE DO ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO COME FORWARD WITH SOME TYPE OF PROPOSAL. TO ADDRESS THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AS PART OF THE MARY VISION -- WITH REALLY. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE LARGER STATE BUDGET. PICTURE AND I THINK THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO THAT IS WHEN THE GOVERNOR CAN CONSIDER ALL OF THE VARIOUS STATE BUDGET PRIORITIES TOGETHER. AS WELL AS THIS ISSUE -- AND DETERMINE WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH TO MOVE FORWARD WELL. I'M SURE YOU RECOGNIZE AS MY CHAIR OF A BUDGET ALWAYS SAYS THAT THE THE IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE. TO CREATE THE BUDGET. AT THE GOVERNOR ONLY HAS VETO POWER -- AND BUT HE CAN'T AT THINGS IN. AND SO WILL MAKES A VERY CLEAR HE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT IS RESPONSIBLE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE THE ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE THERE TO MAKE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND AND I REALIZE THAT DEADLINES AND DATES HAPPEN IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR MAKES A STATEMENT IN JANUARY BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF LETTERS THAT COME TO US IN THE INTRO. BEYOND THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO'VE MAKING REQUEST STATION. OF THAT'S THERE AND AND AS I SAID I YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THIS IS IS REALLY A A OF ALL THE THINGS WE'VE KIND OF HEARD ABOUT PROGRAM TO WORK AND DON'T WORK AND WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS IS TRULY A VIOLATION I MEAN THIS IS REALLY ABUSIVE PEOPLE I MEAN TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I'M NOT AND I'M EVEN CONCERNED THAT HAVING. A THE RESPONSIBILITY WILL FORTY SOME ODD YEARS OF DOING ASSESSMENT EVALUATION FACULTY AND STUDENT COMPLAINTS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON THAT ONE I HAVE -- KIND OF PEOPLE INVESTIGATING EACH OTHER. AND THEIR FRIENDS. THAT DOESN'T RISE TO A LEVEL OF CONCERN FOR ME THAT I WOULD THINK WITH SOME FROM THE SYSTEM EVEN IF IF I ONLY HAVE A FEW COMPLAINTS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE EVALUATING. THEIR FRIENDS AND ASSESSING THEMSELVES AND AND AND HAVE ME BELIEVE THAT IS WITH ANY LEVEL OF OF FIDELITY THAT THAT THIS IS A GOOD PROCESS THAT THAT SHOULD BE THERE THAT. SOMEHOW TO AND AND I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES IN THE PROCESS OF DEALING WITH -- YOU KNOW WITH WITH FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN OTHERS WE HAVE A TENDENCY SOMETIMES EIGHT INSTITUTIONS KIND OF DISMISSED THEIR COMPLAINTS OF TO DISMISS THEM BUT NOT TO GIVE IN SAME LEVEL RIGHTS AS YOU POINTED OUT THAT. THAT THEY'D STILL DESERVE IT THEY HAVE NOT LOST PLAINTIFFS IN THIS REPORT OF THAT HAVE COME FORWARD. SO I I'M JUST SAYING. I AS IT TO ME ABOUT IT IT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A RED FLAG AS A LOT OF ALARM TO GO OFF WHEN I READ SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY IN THE INSTITUTION WOULD BE LIKE WISE AND WHILE WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE IT THE GOVERNOR MAY GET AROUND TO DEALING WITH THIS. THE REALITY IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS HEARING IT NOW. AND HAS TO RESPOND TO IT. MANAGER IF I IF I MAY I I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS TABLE. WHAT WITH THE THOUGHT THAT -- SINCE THE REPORTED IN PRE REPORT ON POST REPORT THAT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. OF BECAUSE WE HAVE AND JUST THE THOUGHT THAT -- THE INITIAL THOUGHT THAT INTERNAL STAFF DOING ENQUIRIES ON THEIR OWN STAFF IS CONCERNING UHHUH. SO THAT HAS SINCE CHANGED. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED STAFF THAT ARE DOING THOSE ENQUIRIES OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION AND THEY ARE UNDER THE DIVISION OF OVERSIGHT THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON PROPER -- THAT IN ITSELF IS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE -- THERE'S A TRAINING COMPONENT THAT ALSO THE STAFF MEMBERS. TO ASK THE PROPER QUESTIONS TO TO HAVE REPORT WRITING SO WHEN THE HIRING AUTHORITY OR THE DECISION MAKER READ THAT THEY KNOW THE READING A REPORT THIS BEEN. THOROUGHLY WENT THROUGH THAT'S BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED -- WERE ALREADY SEEN INDICATIONS THAT -- THAT'S IN A THAT THAT'S THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A MEANT BACK BECAUSE WE TRADITIONALLY WERE ABLE TO MEET TIME FRAME FOR THESE COMPLAINTS. WERE ALREADY MISSING THOSE TIME FRAMES I DON'T LIKE MISS TIME FRAME TO WHAT IT'S TELLING ME NOW IS A DOING A MORE THOROUGH REVIEW ON THESE CASES -- BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS TABLE WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT WE READ THIS AND HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SINCE NOW I ASSUME YOU WANT TO READ THIS. AND THAT AND AS I READ SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'RE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT MY CONCERN WAS THAT IT THAT IT WAS IN PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT. THAT THE INTERNAL THE INVESTIGATIONS WERE IN PLACE WHERE PEOPLE INVESTIGATING THE FRIENDS AND AND IT WAS KIND OF AN INTERNAL THING THAT WAS CONCERNED FOR ME CLEARLY ONCE THE REPORT IS WRITTEN I KNOW THAT -- BASED ON THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AND WHAT HAVE YOU THAT THING'S GOING TO A THAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES NOW. I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED AS TO HOW THEY HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET TO A SYSTEM THAT STARTS DOING THIS KIND OF THING THAT'S THERE AND AND AND THAT WITH IT SHOULD NEVER GOT [inaudible] MADAM CHAIRMAN CONCERN AS AS RITA POINTED OUT WE FOR A HAD LETTER AFTER LETTER FOR THE LAST I DON'T KNOW. TEN YEARS -- POINTING OUT THESE ISSUES -- AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO US THAT THEY GOT IT GETS TO THIS LEVEL AS WELL BECAUSE THERE ARE UNKNOWN -- PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WHO SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT AND SO -- WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- ABOUT THIS AND IF BY CHANCE THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T COME FOR WITH THE APPROPRIATE PACKAGE AND WE YOU WANT TO DETERMINE. WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ALLOCATION SHOULD BE WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE OUR INPUT INTO WHAT WE THINK IS NECESSARY TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE WELL WE ALWAYS TAKE THE LETTERS? THAT COME IN SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SUBMIT ONE YOU SHOULD WE WILL THANK YOU. ANYTIME BUT YES. SYSTEM. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS AND DISCUSSION IN LIGHT OF THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD YES BECAUSE IF WE'RE LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM CARRILLO REALLY LOOKING AT PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE PRISON. TO IGNORE THAT -- HISTORIC SYSTEMIC. CULTURE THAT HAS BEEN THERE THAT THAT IF YOU EVER BEEN IN THE PRESIDENT I CERTAINLY HAVE IT GETS TALKED ABOUT SORT OF IN THE SHADOWS. AND THERE ARE CERTAIN STAFF DO YOU SEEM TO BE VERY WILLING TO DE HUMANIZE SOME OF THE THE THE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE. SO FOR THE ONE HAND WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT PROGRAM OVERLOOKED RECIDIVISM WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE SYSTEM AND TRY AND IMPROVE THEIR LIVES ON THE OTHER HAND WE IGNORE. THE THE INHUMANE TREATMENTS AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT SOME OF THESE PRISONERS HAVE WHEN THEY'RE INSIDE WHY WOULD THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAMS WHY WOULD THEY FEEL. THAT THE CAN. CULTURE IS CONDUCIVE TO SOLVING THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE SO I AM GLAD CDC OURS IS SERIOUS ABOUT THAT A TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT AS WELL. BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS A SIGNIFICANT CULTURE CHANGE THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO CHANGE INSIDE SO I THINK IF THERE ARE PROPOSALS IF THERE ARE THINGS. THAT WE COULD AND SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THEM RIGHT AWAY. WE NEED TO OUR OUR OBLIGATIONS OVERSIGHT THIS IS PART OF OUR OVERSIGHT WE CAN CHANGE THE AUTHORITIES THAT THE IT HAS WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THOSE STEPS BUT IN THE MEANTIME. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A QUESTION ABOUT RESOURCES FINE WE KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT. BUT IN ORDER TO PREVENT SOME. MORE CATASTROPHIC EFFECT OF HAVING. THE HAPPENING INSIDE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES CAN BE DONE. EXTRA REVIEWS. BUILD BACK SOME CREDIBILITY WITH BOTH WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO WITHIN THE POPULATION THAT YOU'RE SERVING AND MANAGING. THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEND THEM THEY CAN ADDRESS THEIR OWN LIVES WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO. AND THEN REDUCE RECIDIVISM GET BACK IN THE COMMUNITY TO HEALTHIER WAY. IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE INSIDE THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO DO THAT SO THESE ARE PART PARCEL OF REALLY THE SAME CONVERSATION. THAT WE'RE HAVING AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED REALLY AS PART OF THE ONGOING LOOK AND BEFORE THIS WHAT PROBABLY IS IT CRISIS LEVEL BUT BEFORE IT GETS EVEN WORSE OR THERE'S ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CLASS ACTION SUIT OR SOMETHING THAT'S GOING. TO REALLY FORCE US TO LOOK AT THIS MORE DIFFERENTLY LET'S TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY NOW. SEE WHAT WE CAN DO SEE WHAT. WHAT CHANGES NEED TO HAPPEN? INSIDE BECAUSE IT'S ALL OF OUR COMMON GOAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS RESPECTFUL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THEIR THEIR THERE FOR A REASON ABSOLUTELY THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT BY THEIR OWN CHOICE THAT DOESN'T MEAN. THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THEM BEING TREATED AS ANYTHING LESS THAN HUMAN. THEY'RE GONNA PAY THEIR DAD BUT WE HOPE SAYS IS GOING TO REHABILITATE THEM IT'S GOING TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. TO CHANGE. FIX WHAT THEY NEED TO FIX INSIDE A COME OUT AND BE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. RATHER THAN JUST RUN THROUGH THE MILL THAT SOMETIMES PRISONS HAVE THE REPUTATION OF BEING AND AND SHOWS UP IN ALL WHO UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT. WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED TO EMULATE? SO SICK THIS IS OPPORTUNITY LET'S ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ANY PROPOSALS ANY THOUGHTS I THINK THIS COMMITTEES HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN. BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT BUDGET BUT IF WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT ADDING RESOURCES WE HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE RESOURCES ARE GONNA HAVE A FACT. AND HAVE AFFECT NOW AND AND LEAD INTO THE RECIDIVISM CONVERSATION THAT THAT WERE THAT WERE ALSO HAVING AND REALLY HAVE THE IMPACT OF REHABILITATION THAT WE HELP THE PRISON SYSTEMS. ARE AND AND REALLY CAMBY. I AGREE WITH I AGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK -- ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THE LAST BUDGET WAS IN OUR STAFF TRAINING. AND WE ADDED AN ADDITIONAL WEEK AT OUR BASIC TRAINING ACADEMY TO FOCUS ON THE REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE INSTITUTIONS. AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WE WE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR STAFF AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH POPULATION. THE ON THE BASIC PEACE OFFER TRAINING IN THE SAFETY IN THE COUNTING AND ALL THE ALL THE BASIC THINGS OF RUNNING A PRISON. WE HAD TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE WERE DOING A GOOD YOU WITH THE STAFF REMINDING THEM WHY THEY DECIDED TO JOIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION. SO WITH THAT ADDITIONAL WEEK WERE FOCUSING ON THE REHABILITATED REHABILITATION THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE POPULATION AND HOW IMPORTANT A ROLE. THAT THE OFFICER PLAYS IN THAT AND THAT THEY CAN BE A CATALYST FOR GOOD. WHILE MAINTAINING SAFETY SECURITY BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE SAFETY SECURITY YOU CAN'T HAVE ROBUST REHABILITATION OR PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE I WANNA COME. SORE TRAINING STAFF IN THAT ON TOP OF THEIR OWN WELLNESS. FOCUSING ON THAT STAFF WELLNESS TO WELL THIS PIECE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AFTER YEARS. PEOPLE FORGET THE LIFESTYLE THAT THEY'RE LIVING AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. AND IF THEY LOSE FOCUS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEN -- THEY IN TURN CAN BECOME DISGRUNTLED DISMAYED AND START LOOKING AT THIS JOB IS NOTHING MORE THAN JUST WAREHOUSING INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR WE ALSO ADDED AN ADDITIONAL DAY IN THE ANNUAL BLOCK TRAINING THAT STAFF GET ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND WE'RE FOCUSING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL DAY. THOSE TWO THINGS ALSO REMINDING THEM OF THEIR REHABILITATION RESPONSIBILITIES BUT THEN IT ALSO GIVES A TIME FOR THE EXPECTATION TO GET GIVEN ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY ABOUT THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IN REHAB -- AT IT IT DIDN'T TO GET LOST ON ME THE COMMENTERS THAT MADE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT HOUSE SOME OF MY SOME OF THE STAFF IN THE PRISONS HAVE BEEN BOUGHT INTO IT. I TOOK NOTE OF THAT SO WE NEED TO A BETTER JOB AT THAT BUT I THINK. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ADDRESSING THE TRAIN HERE TO DO MORE THAN JUST SHOW UP AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SAME AMOUNT TO INMATES ARE THERE THAT WERE THERE WHEN YOU SHOWED UP. YOU HAVE A REHABILITATION ROLE AND THAT IS TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT WITH DIGNITY -- TO MAINTAIN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE SO PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE IN REHABILITATION -- I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THIS TABLE WITH WITH THE FACT THAT I'M NOT AS CONCERNED AS THERE ABOUT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE STORES I'M FAMILIAR WITH THEM I AM TROUBLED BY THEM. AND I DO WANT -- TO MAKE THEM STORIES THAT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT THEM ANYMORE. AND I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT AND I I KNOW YOU ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS BUT SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT IN FACT WHAT I'VE TOWARD SOME OF THE PRISONS. THERE ARE SOME OFFICERS THAT WE'RE ENCOURAGED NOT TO TALK TO AND THOSE ARE ONES WHO HAVE NOT BOUGHT INTO THE REHABILITATION MISSION AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE. AND THEY SEE THAT ROLE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAT'S NOT CONDUCIVE TO THE CHANGES WE NEED TO SEE IN THE SYSTEM. AND TO THE THE THE CHANGES WE ARE ASKING THE PRISONERS THEMSELVES TO GO THROUGH FOR SO. THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS IS THE SAME CONVERSATION THIS IS PART AND PARCEL. TO TO REALLY ALL OF THE ABOVE IF WE IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THINGS I I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOME OF VERY HARD WORK. RASKIN PRISONERS TO GO THROUGH A LOT TO ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE CULTURE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE MATCHING THAT LEVEL OF CHANGES WHILE I AGREE. WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- JUST. TO QUICK QUESTION FOR THE SECRETARY -- SO BASED ON THIS SITUATION. SORT OF ALLUDED THAT YOU CHANGES SOME POLICIES CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THOSE POLICY CHANGES AND IF. YOU CAN SURE HOW THOSE WERE IMPLEMENTED WITH THOSE DONE IN A IN ORDER IN A MEMO WE'D LIKE TO SEE A COPY OF THAT AS WELL. WE WE CAN GET YOU SOME OF THOSE DOCUMENTS BUT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES LIKE I SAID EARLIER. WAS MOVING THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON AND PUTTING IT UNDER. OUR OFFICE OF OVERSIGHT AND RESEARCH AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT'S REALLY THAT'S UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF WORLD OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS EXISTS. SO IT'S OUT OF THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS I THINK FOR THAT FOR US THAT IS -- THAT IS A BIG CHANGE BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT. PUTS A DIFFERENT SET OF EYES ON THE PRODUCT IS BEING GENERATED. IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE IN THE END THE THE THE CONCERN THAT THE WARDEN CAN DICTATE HOW THIS INQUIRY GOES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT'S REALLY NOT UP TO SOMEONE ELSE A DIFFERENT DIRECTOR ALL TOGETHER TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. THERE ARE NEGOTIATION PIECES THAT HAVE TO GO WITH -- WE HAVE BEEN IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THEM AND AND THEY'VE BEEN PROMISING. WERE THERE ANY OTHER CHANGES THAT THAT WERE DONE. OUTSIDE OF THIS -- THERE'S A TRAINING COMPONENT SO WE DID TRAIN THE STAFF AND POST CERTIFIED COURSES ON INVESTIGATION WE HAVE -- TRAINING THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DO. BUT WE DO HAVE A CERTAIN SET OF LIEUTENANT TO BODY BENT TO THAT TRAINING AT OPPOSE CERTIFIED COURSE WHICH IS BEYOND WHAT WE TYPICALLY TRAIN ON ATTACK AT THE PRISON LAW OFFICE SOME. MAYBE NOT A COMPLETE. AGREEMENT YEP NO GOOD GOOD FACIAL RECOGNITION THERE -- YEAH WE BELIEVE THAT. THE CHANGE THAT THEY MADE OF TAKING IT OUT OF THE INSTITUTION AND PUTTING AN END TO THIS OTHER DIVISION IS ONLY A HALF A STEP IT'S NOT REALLY SUFFICIENT. FORCE. THE BEST STEP IS THEY HAVE AN OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHICH ACTUALLY FOR CASES THAT GO TO GO TO THEM I THINK EVERYBODY AGREES DOES A VERY GOOD JOB OF AN INVESTIGATION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE KING THESE THE TENANTS ARE POSITIONS AND PUTTING THEM IN THE A A WHICH AS RITA MENTIONED AS A SEPARATE TRACK THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT PART OF THE INSTITUTIONAL CULTURE. AND THEY'RE ALREADY DOING A GOOD JOB TO HAVE A GOOD MODEL SO USE THE MODEL EXPANDED A LITTLE TOO TO THE INSTITUTIONS. AND YOU'LL HAVE A MUCH OF BLYTON BETTER LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS SOME THAT SECRETARY WHY WHY WEREN'T THEY BE DIRECTED INTO. NUMBER ONE THERE THERE IS A CONCERN FOR THAT LINE EXISTS BETWEEN IN KOREAN INVESTIGATION. SO IN CRANE WERE WERE FOR OUR FACT FINDING WE'RE TRYING TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE CAN TO DETERMINE. WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO OPEN A FULL INVESTIGATION FOR WE WE START PUTTING PEOPLE UNDER -- UNDER BLY BARGER UNDER OATH SO THEY CAN GET ON TAPE AND RECORD -- FOR US WE WE BELIEVE THAT WE WANTED TO APPROACH THIS THAT -- SINCE IT IS UNDER THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL OVERSIGHT RESEARCH THAT THE TRAINING THAT THE STAFF RECEIVED AS THE EXACT TRAINING THAT'S UNDER THAT DIRECTOR -- WE DON'T BELIEVE THE SEVENTH MOVING AT THE MEANING THE UNDER SIX EXCUSE ME SINCE THE HOURS LATE. HOME. IF YOU SAW THE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT WRITING IT'S BASICALLY SAYING SO YOU SO YOU'RE SAYING THE INQUIRY DOES NOT TO BE DONE BY INTERNAL AFFAIRS BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE INVEST. WHAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S SAID AND FORGIVE ME IF I'M READING THE CRAFTING CORRECTLY IS? THE INQUIRY THAT WAS DONE WAS COMPLETELY -- DONE. BY THE WRONG PEOPLE. SO SO HAVING THE INQUIRY DONE. BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE SEEMS TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY. IMPORTANT SO SO IT IT'S IT DOESN'T IT IT DOESN'T APPEAR COMPLETELY THAT -- YOUR INCREASE BEING DONE BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE. WELL AS I I DON'T WANT TO SCREW THIS UP I REALLY DON'T I DO HAVE WAS DIRECTOR. THE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF OVERSIGHT IS GAME OF YOUR ROSA AND IF I HAVE MISREPRESENTED SOMETHING GAMBLE PLEASE CORRECT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE [inaudible] MEMBERS. ACTUALLY THAT'S GOOD EVENING HOW ALL OF MAKE SURE I PAY. ATTENTION THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME BUT MISTER DE AS YOU'VE NOT MISREPRESENTED ANY OF OUR ACTIONS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE TODAY. IF YOU JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT HERE TO GO OVER. ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTUALLY UNDERGOING HAS EITHER. ALREADY IMPLEMENTED OR IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GRAVITY OF PORT AND IN FACT HOW WE HAVE SOME TREMENDOUS CHANGE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT AT THE MARGINS IT'S REALLY OVERHAULING THE ENTIRETY OF THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS. THE FIRST ONE IS STRUCK FROM THE OFFICE OF APPEALS IN FACT THE OFFICE OF APPEALS WHICH IS THE FINAL LEVEL OF REVIEW THEY CAN WRITE MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS WAS IN THE SAME CHAIN OF COMMAND IS THE PRESENCE RUPTURE THE THE INSTITUTIONS. THAT'S NOW BEEN MOVED IN JANUARY THAT MOVED. TO MY DIVISION WHICH HAS INTERNAL OVERSIGHT THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR THAT FINAL LEVEL TO ACTUALLY REVIEW WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE INSTITUTIONS AND IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE IT BEFORE HAS TO GO TO A LAWSUIT. THE SECOND ONE IS REGULATORY REFORM THE DEPARTMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETELY CHANGING -- THE STRUCTURE OF HOW FOLKS RESPOND. TO THESE APPEALS. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN THE PROCESS OF REDUCING THE REASONS. NOT FOR REJECTING AN APPEAL FROM TWENTY SEVEN FIVE THAT'S SIGNIFICAN IT MEANS THAT IN THE PAST AND DURING THIS. PERIOD WHERE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REVIEWED. IN FACT THE WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAD A PROCESS WHICH WAS WEIGHTED TOWARD THE REJECTION OF THE APPEALS. THROUGH REGULATION WE'RE CHANGING THAT SO THE GEAR IS ACTUALLY WORK WORK WORK LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT IN FACT THE INCARCERATED HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THOSE. APPEALS ANSWERED MORE PROPERLY DEDICATING STAFF SO TEDIOUS HAS TALKED ABOUT DEDICATING LIEUTENANTS BUT ALSO CORRECTIONAL CANCER TUBES IN EVERY INSTITUTION. THEY'RE DEDICATED SOLELY TO THIS PROCESS. DIFFERENT THAN PERHAPS BEFORE IN WHICH THEY WOULD BE HANDED OUT TO FOLKS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE TRAINING. THE ENHANCED TRAINING. THE TRAINING GOES BEYOND SIMPLY TRAINING THE FOLKS THAT ARE ANSWERING THE APPEALS. WHAT WE INTEND TO TRAIN EVERY SUPERVISOR THE SUPERVISOR ACADEMY ON HOW TO PROPERLY ANSWER APPEALS EVEN IF THAT'S NOT THE PRIMARY DUTY? IN ADDITION HIRING HIRING TRAINING HIRING AUTHORITY SO THAT THEY UNDERSTAND. THEIR VITAL ROLE IN ENSURING THE RIGHTS OF THE POST TRAINING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY INSPECTOR GENERAL. IS ON OUR AGENDA IT'S ALREADY BEEN FUNDED INTERNALLY AND FOLKS ARE ANSWER THESE APPEALS WILL BE ATTENDING POST TRAINING SO THAT THEY FALL MORE IN LINE WITH PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS. THE FIDELITY NOT ITS PEACE COMPONENT. I I DON'T WANT TO SKIP OVER THIS TOO QUICKLY BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO PREVENT US. FROM FALLING INTO ANOTHER SITUATION SUCH AS AND POINTED OUT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL YOU VAST RIGHTLY SO WHAT EFFORTS WERE TAKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE NOT. IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE ONCE AGAIN IN THE FUTURE FOR FOR SIMILAR SITUATION. BY USING THE OFFICE OF AUDITS IN COURT COMPLIANCE TO REGULARLY AUDIT THESE GRIEVANCES WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE AN INTERNAL MECHANISM. TO IDENTIFY WHERE PERHAPS THERE COULD BE FIXES TO THE SYSTEM BEFORE YOU IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CAN. CAN POINT THAT OUT TO US. ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS -- THE DEPARTMENT EXPLAIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TABLET KIOSK BASS GRIEVANCE AN APPEAL SUBMISSIONS. SO THAT INMATES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT THEIR APPEAL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS THAT THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT. CURRENTLY WELL WE HAVE AN ANTIQUATED SYSTEM IN WHICH WE ATTEMPT -- TO ENSURE CONFIDENTIALITY THE BY MOVING FORWARD WE HOPE TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY BASED SOLUTION FOR THEM. EARLY WARNING SYSTEM -- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING A CHIEF RISK OFFICER WITHIN THE AUDITS OF OFFICE IN COURT COMPLIANCE. WHOSE WHOLE TASK WILL BE TO GATHER ALL THE STATE OF THAT WE HAVE IN DETERMINE SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE -- WE MAY HAVE ORGANIZATIONAL PROVED MET BEFORE IN FACT IT TURNS INTO A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION OR BEFORE. THERE'S A BECOMES A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. AND LASTLY THE INDEPENDENT STAFF COMPLAINT INQUIRY PROCESS WHICH IS RECOMMENDED BY BOTH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AND THE PLO THIS IS THE SECTION WHERE. I THINK WE'VE HAD TO BE SOMEWHAT COOLEY BUT I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND BE VERY CLEAR. WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. IN CREATING A SYSTEM -- OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION. THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS THE NATURAL PLACE TO DO THAT -- WE AGREE -- IT'S INDEPENDENT IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE DIVISION -- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL EAT IN HIS REPORT MADE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS IS THE CORRECT PLACE TO DO THAT. WE'RE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD TO DO THAT THAT'S WHERE THE RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED AND THAT'S THE I PRETTY VERY CLEARLY THAT IF THE RESOURCES NEEDED WE SHOULD LET YOU KNOW -- SOME HERE TO HAVE A THINKS WHICH ONE IS IT IS IT GOING IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS NOT GONNA INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND IN TERMS OF RESOURCES WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU NEED OR YOU NEED NO NEW RESOURCES. WHERE'S ALL SAY I MEAN THE ISSUE OF WHETHER GOING TO TURN AFFAIRS IN THIS THIS WAR THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO LOCK OURSELVES INTO. YOU KNOW THE RESOURCE NAY THAT'S WHY WE'RE EXAMINING INTERNALLY. IF IT'S GOING TO GO UNDER INTERNAL FOR AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WERE ASKING FOR THE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RESOURCES FOR AND BY I'M SORRY IF IT'S NOT GOING UNDER INTERNAL AFFAIRS YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS THAT CAN DO THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE PEOPLE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS WERE WHY WHEN SHE MOVED INDIVIDUALS WERE OUTSIDE INTO INTERNAL AFFAIRS. SO A LOT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE BIG WHAT WILL BE ASKING FOR SUFFICIENT STAFFING FOR THAT RIGHT NOW WE'VE IDENTIFIED. FIFTEEN TO TO IF YOU SAID YOU'VE IDENTIFIED A PROTOCOL AND YOU HAVE SAID YOU ARE ALREADY MOVE THIS PROCESS. INTO THIS INTO HIS DIVISION. SO HAVE YOU MOVED IT BUT THEY'RE NO PEOPLE THERE SO THE PROCESS IS THERE BUT THERE'S NOBODY TO DO THE WORK THE STAFF THERE NOW THESE -- THAT'S WHY WOULDN'T YOU WITH THE SAME STUFF INTO INTERNAL AFFAIRS GEN OUR WITHIN MY DIVISION. INTERNAL OVERSIGHT AND COLORS LE QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION. THE COMPASS IS MORE THAN SIMPLY INTERNAL AFFAIRS SOME OF THE DUTIES CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION FIRST BECAUSE I'VE I'VE I'VE WAITED VERY PATIENTLY FOR YOUR LONG ANSWER. I'M STILL WAITING FOR AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION. PLEASE ASK AGAIN. YOU WANT ME TO REFRESH MEMORY ON THE QUESTION THANK YOU TO SPEND I WANT TO BE VERY A TEN MINUTES. IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN YOUR DIVISION UNDER YOUR PURVIEW. THERE ARE DOING THIS WORK WHY CAN THEY NOT BE MOVED INTO A TOTAL AFFAIRS WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL BUDGET AUGMENTATION. THEY'RE INSUFFICIENT FOLKS. CURRENTLY TO WHY BECAUSE I CALL THEM ONCE INCORRECT. VACATIONS ONE WHY WOULD YOU HAVE THEM DO THE INQUIRY TO BEGIN WITH IF THEY'RE INSUFFICIENT FOLKS. IF THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO THE INVESTIGATION WHY HAVE YOU ASKED HIM TO DO THIS INVESTIGATION. THEY ARE CONDUCTING IN COURSE NOT FULL INVESTIGATIONS WELL ONE OF THE GIVEN THE NONPROFIT TO DO YEP IT BUT IF YOU MOVE THEM INTO INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHY CAN'T THEY DO THE INQUIRIES WITH AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. YEAH I I I APOLOGIZE I OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR BUT MANY OF THE THINGS THAT I DISCUSSED. OCCUR NOW WITH IN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS BUT INTERNAL OVERSIGHT. MOVING THE ENTIRETY OF THE STAFF COMPLAIN PROCESS WHICH IS. LIKE 720% OF ALL OF THE PROCESS WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STAFFING WHY CAN'T YOU MOVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THIS INTO A TRAUMA. THE CURRENT PEOPLE TO DO STAFF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM THAT'S NOT THEIR SOLE. JOB OF THAT IN FACT IS ONE OF THE SAID BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF STAFF COMPLAINTS ARE HANDLED BY. FOLKS THAT HAVE THAT IS AN ADDITIONAL DUTY DOCTOR NORMAL CHRIS OF DUTY FOR THE SO THEY'RE NOT. P. Y. SPECIFICALLY DEDICATE YOUR YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE ASKING PEOPLE WHO ARE QUALIFIED. TO DO INCREASED TO DO INCREASED. THEY ARE THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THE STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS THE NEW INQUIRY PROCESS THEY WILL BE TRAINED ON THEY WILL BE TRAINED IN THIS NEW PROCESS WHEN. TRAINING ALREADY BEGAN LAST MONTH WE WILL BE COMPLETE. HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE YOU TRAIL [inaudible] UNDER THE THE EFFORT WERE STILL. TRAINING FOLLOWED WASTING SADDAM NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING. THE WESTERN FROM SCRATCH WITH ME THAT'S A GOOD -- FOLKS THAT WERE TRAINING YEAH AND THE INSTITUTIONS TO DO STAFF COMPLAINTS. THANK YOU FOR TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE. I THINK WE HAVE ONE SCHEDULE I ALWAYS GO. LIKE APRIL MAY. AND WE'RE TRAINING RIGHT NOW -- EVERY CC TO CORRECT OKAY ALSO SUPERVISOR. TO AND EVERY STEP COMPLETELY TO THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS. FIFTEEN AND THAT'S THE STAFF WERE TRAINING RIGHT NOW OKAY AND AND THE CLASSICAL LONG THE TRAINING PROGRAM IS. FOR THE SENATE DISTRICT UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S TAKEN TELL MADE A TRAIN FIFTEEN PEOPLE. WITHOUT IS REGIONAL ALLIES TRAINING GOING TO ALL THIRTY FIVE PRISON SO I THINK IT'S EITHER SO THE TRAININGS ROAD EIGHT MORE ARE MAY I DON'T HAVE THE CALENDAR WITH ME A WIN IN. I CAN'T RECALL. BET BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING A QUESTION THROUGH MEANS I'M ASKING THE QUESTION RIGHT SO. WHY CAN'T THOSE FIFTEEN INDIVIDUALS BE PART OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAMS? EVEN WITH A FIFTY INDIVIDUALS BEING PART OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAMS. THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DO ALL THAT SO I WAS IN THE QUESTION. QUESTIONS WHY CAN'T THEY BE PART INFERNAL FIRST I MEAN YOU COULD TRY IT AGAIN I I'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION YOU CAN TELL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT BUT I'M JUST SAYING. CAN I GET AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT APARTMENT DID IN RESPONSE TO NOT ONLY THE IG REPORT BUT WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT TO THE IS AT FIFTEEN OVER INSTITUTIONS WE HAD WHAT WE CALL CORRECTION COME THROUGH. TO AND THAT'S THE FIFTEEN PRESENCE THERE WERE TWO STAFF WORK THE APPEALS OFFICE. AND THEN EVERY OTHER PRISON HAD ONE QUESTION TO SUPERVISOR. ACTION TO SPECIALISTS. BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE STAFF WORK THE SAME FACILITY. TO THE SOUTH COMPLAINT. SO WHAT WE DECIDED INTERNALLY BEFORE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT CAME OUT. WAS TO TAKE AT THOSE FIFTEEN PRISONS THAT HAD THE HIGHEST APPEALS. THE SECOND COMMERCIAL CANCER TO SPECIALISTS WE CONVERTED TO A LIEUTENANT AND SO FOR US WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE SHOT OURSELVES IN THE FOOT ESSENTIALLY MISTER DE AS TALKED ABOUT -- WE RUN UP AGAINST OVER DO APPEALS OR WHAT HAVE YOU IS WHEN WE TOOK AWAY THAT WORK FORCE FOR THE APPEALS OFFICE WE CUT ARE SO SHORT. WE PULLED THE TRIGGER TO SO AND SO FOR US TO MOVE THOSE FIFTEEN LIEUTENANTS OVER. TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS VERSUS FIFTEEN LIEUTENANTS AND COVER CONVERTING BACK TO QUESTION CULTURE TWOS THE HELP TO THE WORKLOAD IN THE APPEALS OFFICE. WHERE WE CUT OURSELVES SHORT? I'M I'M I'M SORRY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WEEK WE HAVE. TO CLEARLY WE'RE NOT ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION AND I I I I KNOW THAT THE BASIC QUESTIONS WHAT WHY DON'T WE JUST MOVEMENT AYE INTERNAL AFFAIRS. AND AND THEN WHAT THE THE THE BIGGER QUESTIONS RIGHT YOU YOU YOU YOU CAME HERE AND YOU SAID IN A DOCTOR DOCTOR I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT GONNA REPEAT WE TALKED WEBER SIR BECAUSE SHE ALWAYS. SPEAKS MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN ALL OF US I'M JUST GOING TO ASK THAT THE QUESTIONS. WHICH IS. YOU SAY YOU ARE AS TROUBLED BY. BY THIS AS WE ARE. AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A REACTION THAT REFLECTS THAT SAME LEVEL OF CONCERN. SO I GUESS TO SAY THAT YOU WERE. ASKING FIFTEEN PEOPLE DOESN'T QUITE WE HAVE WOMEN WE GOT TO THE NEXT QUESTION. WHICH IS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE IN SALINAS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. YOU GOT ALL THESE COMPLAINTS YOU GOT THIS INVESTIGATION THAT WAS. COMPLETELY. IT INADEQUATE NOT EVEN THE RIGHT WORD BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THEY'RE SO. STICK IT ON THE FIRST LINE OF QUESTIONING WHICH IS. HOW DO YOU ENSURE? THE PEOPLE'S NOT ONLY CIVIL RIGHTS BUT THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS TO BE PROTECTED AND THEY HAVE AN PROPER. THEY HAVE A PROPER COMPLAIN PROCESS AND THAT THERE'S A PROPER. I GUESS INQUIRY ENDED INVESTIGATION. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE. THE PROCESS THAT YOU ARE SAYING HAS YOU'VE TAKEN A HUGE STEP. IS AND I'M GLAD I'M NOT GONNA PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OR THE PRISON LAW OFFICE BUT THEY CAN CHIME IN IF THEY WANT. TO DOESN'T SEEM. TO PASS. THE SNIFF TEST. OF THEM [inaudible] AND SO. I'LL JUST SAY THIS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOUR **** TROUBLED OR AS CONCERNED AS WE ARE. SO. EITHER YOU CAN FIX IT OR WE WILL. I THINK I GOT THE PROMISE. RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND SO THEN THE BASIC CORE QUESTION AS TO HOW SOON CAN YOU COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. WITH. A PLAN. AND I DON'T THINK NAY IS FAST ENOUGH. BECAUSE ANYTHING BECAUSE IF YOU COME IN MAY AND WE DON'T LIKE YOUR PLAN THEN WE WILL REJECT. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD BRING IT BACK SOONER SO WE CAN COME TO SOMETHING THAT WE ALL AGREE ON OTHERWISE DOCTOR WEBER IS ENTIRELY CORRECT. THAT IF THIS COMMITTEE. SEE SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T LIKE IT WILL NOT BE IN THE BUDGET. OKAY. THESE ARE VERSION OF SO WHAT WAS THE QUESTION OF YOU CAN HOW SOON CAN YOU COME BACK. BY THE END OF THE MONTH END OF THE MONTH END OF MARCH. OKAY SIR THANK IS THAT OKAY DOCTOR WEB SOUNDS GREAT SO WITH SALINAS WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. SO YOU YOU HAVE THIS INVESTIGATION THAT WAS COMPLETELY [inaudible] BUNGLED. BUT CLEARLY THERE'S PROBLEMS SO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN SALINAS TO AT LEAST TRY TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS. MANY OF THESE. SOUNDS LIKE FAIRLY HORRIFIC INCIDENTS THAT WERE -- WERE CARRIED OUT. SECOND ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. I WANTED THINGS WE'VE STARTED AS DIRECTOR OF YOUR ROSA SAID IS THE TRAINING OF THE STAFF. AND SO I SALINAS VALLEY THE WORD IS CURRENTLY USING ONLY STAFF HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DO INVESTIGATIONS AND HAVE THOSE TECHNIQUES AND BE ABLE TO SET UP TO ENCOURAGE CORRECTLY. HAS ALWAYS BEEN LOOK REALLY RESTRICTED TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE DOING THEM WE'RE STILL WORKING TO GET ALL OF OUR STAFF TRAINED TO PROPERLY. THROUGH -- I ATE BUT IS SOME OF THE STEPS THAT THE WORD HAS TAKEN VERSUS HAVING. TWENTY DIFFERENT STAFF DONNA WHO HAVE NOT BEEN I THINK THE NEW PROCESS PROCESS IN PLACE THERE'S NEW COMPLAINTS. THERE'S CLEARLY A PROBLEM I DON'T I DON'T I DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS ANOTHER INVESTIGATION TO SEE THAT'S A PROBLEM TO BASED ON THE EAST THIS PROBLEM. WHAT WHAT IS BEING DONE AT THE PRESENT TO ADDRESS? WHAT SEEMS LIKE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WHAT WHAT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKE? WELL WE'VE HAD A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP WITH THE NEW WARDEN THERE SHE'S BEEN THERE. MAYBE SENSE I THINK ONLY ONE PERSON. NO THE WARDEN HAD BEEN THERE OF SHE'S GOT IT. ACTING DEPUTY WE SENT IN A MENTOR RETIRE WARDEN IN THERE TO HELP MENTOR ALSO. SO AND WE'VE ALSO GONE IN WITH SOME RESOURCE TEAMS PREVIOUSLY AND SINCE SOME FOLKS IN THE HELP WORK MARKET AND WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK WITH SALINAS VALLEY THE WARDEN THERE -- TAKE THIS REPORT VERY SERIOUSLY SHE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF HER AND MAYES THERE. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HER FROM HAVE A HEADQUARTERS PERSPECTIVE. NOW I I FULLY APPRECIATE YOU GOT A LEADERSHIP CHANGE -- HOW DO YOU? HOW DOES YOUR TEAM GO IN THERE AND? ASSESS SORT OF CULTURE CHANGE WITH THE TEAM [inaudible] AS IT IT'S GREAT THE WARDEN SPOT IN BUT YOU GOT A TEAM. THAT PERHAPS IS NOT PART IN SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU WORK THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT I KNOW DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN I APOLOGIZE TO SPEAKING OF NOT AT ALL. SOME OF WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T WORKING AND THE RETIRED AND KNOW WHAT TO MENTOR THAT WE HAVE IN THERE. IF ONE THEY STARTED WITH SUPERVISORY MEETINGS WITH SERGEANTS AND LIEUTENANTS. BECAUSE WHERE YOU REALLY GET YOUR BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IS DIRECTION FOR THAT PRESIDENT. THIS IS ALSO DOING TOWN HALL MEETINGS WHERE OFFICERS HERE. THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR WHO HAS OVERSIGHT OF THEIR PRISON MAKES FREQUENT TRIPS DOWN HERE AS DOES THE DIRECT W. DIRECTOR WHO WAS JUST HERE RECENTLY. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO VISIT IN THE PRESIDENT CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT SHE'S DOING HER. TOWN HALL MEETINGS WITH HER STAFF THAT SHE'S MEETING WITH HER SERGEANTS AND LIEUTENANTS TO REALLY GET THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE. THEY'VE GOT TO DO BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY. AND WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE A SERVICE TO THE POPULATION WHO LIVE THERE. THANK YOU AND THEN. BASED ON THESE -- SORT OF NEW IMPROVE IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES HOW HOW WILL. HOW WOULD YOU GET FEEDBACK THAT YOU'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? I HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT -- BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MEASURE THEN YOU CAN RESPOND OKAY. AFTER PROVIDING THE TRAINING IN IMPLEMENTING THE NEW PROCESS. A PART OF THE ONGOING -- RESTRUCTURING INCLUDES THE OFFICE OF APPEALS ACTUALLY GOING AND DOING LIVE OBSERVATIONS OF THE APPEALS PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE. HAVE BOUGHT IN THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY -- TREATING THE IN MAY TWO MAINLY IN. ALL OF THE INTENDED. OUTCOMES ARE CURRY -- THEY'RE NOT FROM THE SAME DIVISION THEY THEY'RE GOING FROM MY OUTFIT DO THESE OBSERVATIONS AND COME BACK WITH RESULTS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER NEEDS TO BE. ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR DISCIPLINARY. AND HOW ABOUT WHEN ARE THEY START TO GO DOWN AND THEN WILL YOU START TO GET SOME FEEDBACK OF SOME RESULTS WELL THE TRAINING. BEGAN LAST MONTH THAT'S GONNA OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS -- DURING THAT SAME PERIOD WE'VE IDENTIFIED FOLKS FROM MY SHOP THEY'RE GOING TO ADDITIONAL TRAINING THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN FUNCTION THAT CAPACITY THAT MENTORING CAPACITY. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IN A BUT WHAT IS YOUR TEAM YOU MENTIONED YOUR TEAM'S GONNA GO DOWN INTO SOME OBSERVATION MAKE SURE THAT. THINGS START TO CHANGE A TARGET FOR THAT WAS -- THE BEGIN TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO JULY. JULY OF THIS YEAR SO JULY. NINETEEN CORRECT OKAY SEE SO YOU WON'T HAVE ANY. YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THERE YOU'RE DOING TRAINING YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO ASSESS BUT YOU WON'T HAVE ANY. FEEDBACK INTEL. JULY OF NOT WHAT JULY THAT YOU WHEN YOU GONNA GO DOWN THERE THAN WOMEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME. DATA AND SOME RESULTS WHICH OF THE QUICKLY BUT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN IS THAT THE WORK GROUP SO WE'VE PUT TOGETHER INCLUDE FOLKS THAT -- TRADITIONALLY SO JUST JUST TO STICK WITH MY IF YOU COULD JUST STICK WITH ME FOR ONE SECOND SO JULY YOU'RE SENDING PEOPLE DOWN. YES. AFTER YOU SEND PEOPLE DOWN WHEN WILL YOU GET -- THE REVIEWS BACK FROM THAT. HEY. THINGS ARE GOING RIGHT THINGS ARE NOT GOING RIGHT THINGS SEEM LIKE THEY'RE THE MOVE IN THE THOSE REVIEWS -- MEDIA SO THE WEEK AFTER THEY GO DOWN HAVE OUR FIRST SET OF INFORMATION TO FROM WHICH TO ACT OKAY SO SO SOMETIME IN JULY WILL HAVE A SENSE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE ACTIONS HAVE. BEEN APPROPRIATE. THE TRUE BUT BEFORE THEN WE'VE ALSO ENGAGE THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN AND OUR WORK GROUP -- IT AND THEY COME BACK WITH FEEDBACK AS WELL WE HOPE THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE PRESENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE INSTITUTIONS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE IF THEY SEE CHANGES OR I THINK IT WENT BY THE TO THE WORK GROUP AS WELL WHEN WILL WE HEAR BACK FROM THE ON BUTTON. AT WHICH I ENGAGE AND RARELY HAVE MEETING EVERY TWO WEEKS -- REGARDING THIS TOPIC. SO THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED GIVE YOU FEEDBACK. THEY HAVE AND WHAT'S THAT. ONE OF THE SENATE WELL THE FEEDBACK HAS. REALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON THE TRAINING COMPONENT -- THEY ACTUALLY REVIEWED THE CURRICULA ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN FOLKS -- AND NOW THAT THE TRAINING IS STARTING I HOPE TO SEE FEEDBACK TO MOZILLA THEY'VE BEEN PRESENT AT ORIGINAL TRAINING. THE SECURE BUT THERE IT'S AT THE OMBUDSMAN JUST REVIEWING THE TRAINING THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY OBSERVING TO SEE. IF SAY HEY THESE FOLKS TOOK THE TRAINING AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK THAT'S TRUE BUT THEY RECEIVE COMPLAINTS OBVIOUSLY FROM AN MAYES THROUGHOUT THE THE STATE. OKAY AS A HOW THEY'VE BEEN RECEIVING COMPLAINTS TO FROM SALINAS. THAT'S I'VE NOT RECEIVED FEEDBACK WITH REGARD TO SALINAS IN PARTICULAR [inaudible] HAVE YOU. WHEN THE OMBUDSMAN'S GO OUT THEY TYPICALLY GO IT IS A MONTH TO DIFFERENT PRESS AS AND THE CHIEF OF THE CHIEF OMBUDSMAN WILL DO ME A ROLL OF OTHER REPORTS? SO YES WE STILL GET SOME COMPLAINTS OF SALINAS VALLEY AND I THINK -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE SAID IT TO CHANGE THE CULTURE TO CHANGE THAT I NOW MAKE TAKES TIME IS NOT OVERNIGHT PROCESS. BUT I GET A WEEKLY WE ROLL UP FROM THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE OF ANY ISSUES THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED IF THESE TOWARD OUR PRE PRESENT THAT PREVIOUS WEEK. AND AND SO ON HAVE HAD THE HAVE THE COMPLAINTS IN SIMILAR OR LESS SEVERE I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT. WAY TO ASK THE QUESTION IS AT THE MEAN. THIS IS A LIFE. THE SAME KIND OF COMPLAINTS WERE SEEN HERE ARE THE SORT OF MORE MINOR COMPLAINTS BUT WHAT I TYPICALLY SEE FROM THE OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE I HAVEN'T ASKED ME IN PARTICULAR OF OR HAVE THEY PROVIDED ME ANYTHING WITH THERE'S ALLOCATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IS USUALLY EITHER AROUND THE INMATE DIDN'T GET SOME THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HAD COMING OR THERE'S A PROPERTY ISSUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR IN THEY DIDN'T GET RELEASED ON A PROGRAM. SO I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THEM IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHETHER. INMATES HAVE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AS RELATES TO USE OF FORCE OR OTHER ISSUES. WITH THE ITS INMATES GO TO THEM WITH THOSE KINDS OF COMPLAINTS. YES THEY DO ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN SAN CONFIDENTIAL MAIL TO THE OMBUDSMAN ALSO AND WHEN THE OMBUDSMAN'S ARE OUT AN INSTITUTION. THERE ARE OTHER INSTITUTION FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK. AND SO THEY WALKING THE TALK WITH THE POPULATION. IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO ASK THEM SPECIFICALLY THAT QUESTION I GET IT BACK TO US WHETHER THERE IS ADDITIONAL. YES I CAN DO THAT -- MY SUGGESTION IS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS INVITE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO GO IN AND DO A FOLLOW UP -- TO SEE. IF ANYTHING DIFFERENT HAS OCCURRED. IS IS IS THERE A REGULAR FOLLOW UP PROCESS TO YOUR REPORT NO NOT IN THIS REPORT IN. OTHER REPORTS THAT WE DO. WE GET A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT'S PART OF OUR JURISDICTION TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THAT AREA. IN THIS INSTANCE WE WERE INVITED IN TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM. AND THEN ARE. WE HAVE NO JURISDICTION. TO ASK FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN OR TO GO BACK AND LOOK TO SEE WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO I HAVE NO VISIBILITY ON WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON THERE NOW. SECRETARY TIAS AND I HAVE HAD. A NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS. BUT I HAVE NOT HAD ANY DISCUSSION WITH HIM ABOUT LONG CREEK FIXES FOR WORKER FOR THE ISSUES THAT WE WERE SO MISTER SECRETARY HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT FOLLOW UP BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. I DO NOT I WOULD LIKE FOLLOW UP I KNOW THAT -- THE ONLY G. DOES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RECEIVE CONFIDENTIAL LETTERS FROM AND MY POPULATION THERE IS A ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER POSTED IN. EVERY HOUSING UNIT AT THE PRESENCE OF THE GIVEN DIRECT ACCESS TO THE O. I. G. -- I HAVEN'T HEARD AND ROY YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF IF YOU RECEIVED. COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE SINCE YOU'VE LAUGHTER LE BECAUSE THAT AND I KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE USE. IF THERE ARE CONCERNS LIKE THAT YOU DO COME TO US WITH THEM. YES IN FACT -- STAFF MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS ARE THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT WE RECEIVE ACROSS THE STATE. BUT SINCE SINCE THE O. I. G.'S SINCE THE REPORT WHAT WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE. FOR LETTERS AND PHONE CALLS I THINK SINCE THE REPORTS COME OUT WE HAVE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I THINK. MY HUNCHES THAT THE INMATE POPULATION IS WAITING TO SEE. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BECAUSE? OF THE FEEDBACK WE GOT WHEN WE SHOWED UP WAS DIDN'T REALLY COMPLAIN TO US MUCH BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAITH THAT ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN ALSO. AFTER THE REPORTS COME OUT I KNOW THAT MISTER SPECTER'S HAD DISCUSSIONS HIS STAFF HAS HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH. WITH -- THEIR CLIENTS. AND I THINK THAT. NOW EVERYBODY'S IN KIND OF A WAITING. PATTERN TO SEE A HOLDING PATTERN TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF THIS. WHAT WE ME WHAT MY MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE IF YOU'RE AGREEABLE IS THAT? THE TWO OFFICES CLOSER TOGETHER AND DEVELOP SOME FOLLOW UP PLAN. IF IF THERE IF THERE ISN'T A FOLLOW PLAN DEVELOPED I MEAN I'M SURE THAT WE CAN. REQUEST THE SPEAKER WE HAS INTEREST ROW ROW AND I'D ME QUITE REGULARLY AND WE WE COMMUNICATE QUITE REGULARLY AND ONE OF THE LAST CONVERSATIONS WAS AS WE DEVELOPED I DID COMMIT TO HIM WOULD BE SHARING AT ALL ALL THE PLANS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED SO WE SELECT WE DON'T. TALK. I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK THE QUESTION WAS IS REGARDING SALINAS WHAT ARE NOT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SHOULD FOR ONLY WOULD YOU BE WILLING. TO HAVE THE OFFICE TO DO ANY FOLLOW UP SPECIFICALLY. WITH THE SALINAS SITUATION SO YOU SEE YOU HAVE THE ABOUT THE PERSON YOU HAVE THE TRAINING YOU GOT JULY COMMON. SO THE QUESTION IS WE WHAT WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WOULD YOU. BE INTERESTED IN HAVING THEM. TAKE ANOTHER LOOK TO TYPICAL FOR US WHEN WE HAVE OUR AUDITOR. TO REPORT SOME YOU JUST HEARD THE AUDITOR EARLIER ALL UP WITH THE AUDITOR BASED ON WHAT THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE FOUND THAT THAT'S A PROTOCOL WHICH ARE GONNA BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT AUTO. SO THE QUESTION IS IS WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE THE OFFICE -- MORE FURTHER INVOLVED AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T WE WE MAY WANT TO HAVE THE OFFICE MORE FURTHER INVOLVED THAT TO SEND YOU TO TALK MAYBE RYAN I DEFINITELY MAKE WITH THE THE TOPIC OF THE MEETING THIS WEEK. PERFECT AND IF YOU COULD REPORT BACK TO US SO WE'RE I MEAN WE'RE AROUND NEXT WEEK. ONE OF THE ISSUES I HAVE TO BRING IS THE SAME ISSUE THAT MR TIAS BROUGHT HIS THAT ARE. BECAUSE THIS IS A PART OF OUR OUR STATUTE OR NOT RESOURCE TO FOR THESE KIND OF ONGOING THINKS NOW I'M. OBVIOUSLY WILLING TO GO BACK AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK. AND DO THAT BUT THAT IMPACTS OTHER WORK THAT WE DO. BECAUSE FOR EVERY HOUR I HAVE SOMEBODY DOING THIS OR NOT DOING SURE THE WORK THAT THAT THE NORMAL THAT'S A SEPARATE CONVERSATION YOU NEED TO HAVE A DOCTOR EVER SINCE. IN OF THE CLINIC YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY -- WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS ANYONE FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER. PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE. DON'T HAVE ONE PERSON. GREAT OKAY THANK DR NORMAN SCOTT NOT I TEACH CRIMINOLOGY SOCIOLOGY OF LAW CHICO STATE. BUT FOR THIRTY YEARS I HAD A CAREER IN RESEARCH -- IN CORRECTIONS MOST OF IT WAS WITH THE YOUTH AUTHORITY BUT FOR AWHILE AFTER I'M SORRY WE COMMENTS SO SINCE IS ONLY TWO OF YOU. IS THAT RIGHT. YEAH OKAY WOULD YOU EACH GET TWO MINUTES SIR OKAY [inaudible] ANYWAY -- I WAS OUT WITH THE FORMER YOUTH AUTHORITY AT THE TIME OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE YOUTH AUTHORITY AND CDC ARE. SHALL I A WAS WITNESS TO SOME OF THE DIALOGUE AND SO FORTH IT WAS HELD AT GALT AND SECRETARY HICKMAN AT THE TIME. I DID A BIG -- PUSH ON TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CODE OF SILENCE AND I REMEMBER SITTING IN THIS CROWD OF I DON'T KNOW FOR FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE. AND KIND OF SEE THE SNICKERS AND OVER HEARING THINGS IN THE MEN'S ROOM AND WELL IT IT WAS AN UP HILL BATTLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF MUCH MORE HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT THAT EVERYONE. HAS TO SIGN A STATEMENT SAYING THAT THEY AGREES TO IN A REPORT ON STAFF MISSED CAUGHT MUST CONDUCT. BUT THEY DON'T. AND MADAM CHAIRMAN YOU KNOW YOU'RE -- NIGHTMARE IDEA WHAT GOES ON THE PRISONS. IN TERMS OF MOVIES WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME I SAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES. IS ALL TOO TRUE. NOW SOME PRISONS ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS. MOST CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE DECENT PEOPLE. BUT THERE'S FEAR EVERYWHERE. AND IN THAT FEAR GOES INTO CENTRAL OFFICE AS WELL. FULLER FREDDIE TO RAT ON SOMEBODY ELSE AND IT CAN BE -- FOR FIT THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY. IT CAN ALSO BE MORE LIKELY THEIR CAREER. AND I FOUND OUT THIS. PERSONALLY -- WHEN I WAS INVOLVED IN THE EVALUATION? OF THE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION UNITS HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON. AND SEVERAL OF US BROUGHT BACK ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE. TWO CENTRAL OFFICE. AND WE SAID ALLEGATIONS WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE A LOT OF IT. ALTHOUGH SOME OF IT WAS SUBSTANTIATED WITH MEDICAL FILES THAT WE WERE GIVEN. BUT WE QUICKLY REALIZED THAT. NO ONE WANTED TO HEAR THAT. AND THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RETALIATION AGAINST ME I RETIRED EARLY BASICALLY BECAUSE OF IT BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY IS THERE IS A WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW IS IS JUST ONE INSTANCE. I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW THESE KIND OF SITUATIONS IN EVERY PRISON ALL THE TIME. BUT THEY HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND NOTHING EVER REALLY SEEMS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. HI I WAS INVOLVED IN THAT YOU KNOW ISSUE INTO HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON A FEW YEARS LATER THEY HAD ANOTHER ONE UP THERE. I MEAN IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING. AND AND I'VE BEEN WORKING I WAS ON THE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE FOR A FEW YEARS. AND I SEE HOW HARD THEY'VE BEEN WORKING TO TRY TO DO THINGS BUT IT'S REALLY SLOW. IT'S IT'S A TREMENDOUS. FORMIDABLE TASK TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CULTURE INSIDE. THANK FOR MENACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER ON JIM LINDBERGH ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA -- I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S RECOMMENDATIONS. I GUESS I'M QUALIFIED -- ON ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT -- OUR ORGANIZATION SENDS A NEWSLETTER OUT. TO ALL THE PRISONS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE GET AN AWFUL LOT OF MAIL. UP FROM PRISONERS AND OVER THE YEARS -- WE'VE JUST ABOUT COMPLAINTS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. BUT USUALLY THE OVER ARCHING THEME. IN THESE LETTERS TO THESE COMPLAINTS TO US. IS THAT -- PRISONERS DON'T FEEL THEY HAVE ANY MEANS OR OR PROCESS -- TO DEAL WITH THESE COMPLAINTS AND UP YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO CASE WORK IN OUR OFFICE OUR FOCUS IS LEGISLATIVE -- I WAS HERE WHEN HEARINGS WERE HELD A ABOUT THE CODE OF SILENCE -- WITH -- BY SENATOR GLORIA ROMERO -- SENATOR JACKIE SPEAR -- I WAS INVOLVED -- IN NORTH MISTER SCOTT IT INTO THE LEGISLATURE -- AFTER THE INCIDENTS AT HIGH DESERT -- BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND TEN THAT HE MADE PEOPLE AWARE OF AND I'M SORRY TO SAY. THAT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THERE WAS REALLY LEGISLATIVE INTEREST AT THAT TIME. AND AS A RESULT THAT HAS AFFECTED MY ADVOCACY. AND IN FACT TODAY I DID GOOGLE -- HIGH DESERT -- AND INCIDENTS OF STAFF MISS CONTACT A TRYING. TO REFRESH MY MEMORY ABOUT WHEN I BROUGHT -- MISTER SCOTT OF TO THE LEGISLATURE BACK THEN AND A WHOLE SET OF NEW INCIDENTS. POPPED UP ON GOOGLE OF OF THINGS THAT IT HAPPENED -- AFTER THAT OKAY BUT I I THINK THAT THE THING THAT. CONCERNS ME THE MOST -- IS THE IMPACT THAT THIS DOES HAVE ON THE PRISON CULTURE -- IT'S BASICALLY TELLING PRISONERS -- THAT THEY DON'T MATTER -- THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS AND SO THEN WHY WOULD THEY BUY INTO -- THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE MAKING -- HERE TO TRANSFORM THE CULTURE AND MAKE PRISONERS PRISONS UP MORE REHABILITATED. THEN PUNITIVE ARE YOU AUTHORED A BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY WHICH THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ACT. WHICH SAID THAT THE PURPOSE. OF OF SENTENCING WOULD BE PUBLIC SAFETY. AS OPPOSED TO WHERE IT ALWAYS SAID -- PUNISHMENT -- SO I I JUST THINK WE'VE. STILL. GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WHEN I SAW THIS ON THE DAILY FILE AND IS INTEREST -- IN IN IN THIS ISSUE AGAIN IT IT REALLY -- MADE ME WANT TO COME FORWARD -- BUT I I DO THINK THAT IT THAT -- THESE INVESTIGATIONS I DO HAVE TO BE CONDUCTED OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL -- PRISON ENVIRONMENT -- WE NEED TO PUT CREDIBILITY BACK IN INTO THE PROCESS SO THAT PRISONERS WHEN THEY HAVE. LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS NOTED THAT THERE IS SOME DUE PROCESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT -- THERE'S NO THE PUBLIC COMMENT THE THINK WE'VE HELD HER THE FOUR ISSUES OF THE TH REALLY THREE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE -- TO THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE'LL HEAR BACK FROM THE INTERESTED PARTIES -- AS WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE IF ANY OF YOU HAVE LETTERS OR OR IDEAS THAT YOU THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER AND THIS PROCESS WE DON'T WANT TO LET THIS JUST SIMPLY. GLOSS OVER AND GO FORWARD -- BUT WE WANT TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO -- IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO MAKE CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM AND TO CORRECT SOME OF THE ERRORS AND NOT JUST SIMPLY UP -- LET THIS MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION WELL FOR YOUR INFORMATION FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK THE AUDIENCE FOR COMING THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR HANGING AROUND THIS LATE IN THE EVENING AS WELL -- BUT THE OBVIOUSLY THE CONVERSATION IS WELL WORTH IT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH IN THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED THANK YOU
