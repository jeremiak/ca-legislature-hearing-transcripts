WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF REMOTE OR DISTANCE LEARNING. STUDENTS AND FACULTY OF RETURN TO CAMPUS AND THE STATE HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION. DESPITE THE SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO CAMPUS THE IMPACTS IMPACTS OF COVERT NINETEEN CONTINUE TO REVERBERATE THROUGHOUT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. WELL THE PANDEMIC HAS PRODUCED UNIQUE CHALLENGES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN MITIGATING NATION WIDE ENROLLMENT LOSS LEARNING LAS AND WIDESPREAD WORK FORCED RESIGNATIONS THE PANDEMIC HAS ALSO PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TO QUESTION THE CONVENTIONAL NORMS OF HOW EDUCATION IS PROIDED.

ADDRESSED I WAS ALSO ASKED TO ADDRESS- IF THERE WERE ISSUES OF- ENROLLMENT LAWSON- AND- AND WHAT IS THE PICTURE THERE AND CERTAINLY I WAS ASKED AS YOU MENTIONED CHAIR MEDINA OUT ABOUT- THE GOING FORWARD HOW DO WE RECOVER WITH WITH EQUITY SO I'LL TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE IN BRIEF BUT I'M CERTAINLY AVAILABLE. FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT THEY THAT YOU WOULD COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. IN BRIEF- ALL CAMPUSES HAVE RETURNED TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION OF COURSE OUR SEMESTER CAMPUSES ARE RETURNED TO THAT STATUS EARLY IN IN AUGUST AND- AND THE OTHERS IN SEPTEMBER FOR MOST OF OUR CAMPUSES THAT IS MEANT ROUGHLY ABOUT YEAH- 85% OF THE COURSES ARE IN PERSON BUT THAT MEANS. A SIGNIFICANT OUR PORCH ABOUT 15% R. OUR- AND REMOTE. ONLINE HYBRID. OUR CAMP WILL. AT THE FIVE OF COURSE- LOCAL- AND COUNTY HEALTH CARE GUIDANCE. WE ALSO HAD IN THE UC SYSTEM OUT A VACCINE- POLICY MANDATE SO WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS. ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE GOING TO BE ON CAMPUS HAD TO BE VACCINATED AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR OF OUR A RETURNED. TO CAMPUS SAFELY- PROTOCOL UP. KICK OUT ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO FURNISH PROOF OF THAT VACCINATION AND IF THE WORK NOT GOING TO BE FAXED A DEBT TO HAVE APPROVED THE EXCEPTION. AND I AND WHICH WERE WERE VERY FEW OUT WE HAD AN AIM FOR ABOUT 9090% OF THOSE ON CAMPUS IS BEING VACCINATED AND ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE MET AND EXCEEDED THAT. ARE THERE ARE ALL WHEN YOU'RE IN IN PERSON INDOORS YOU HAVE TO BE MASKED AND ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE PROTOCOLS FOR MANAGING MASS MIGRATIONS TO AND FROM CAMPUS WHICH IS A SENSITIVE TIME FOR- FACT- FOR OUR VIRUS TRANSMISSION. SO SO THEY HAD TO BE TESTED BEFORE TO KMART YEAH. THEY HAD. TO HAVE SOME A SEQUESTERING- TO SEE IF EVERYTHING WAS OKAY. AND AND YOU THEY ARE- CHAU DEPOSIT THEY HAD TO BE ISOLATED- ARE IS PART. FOR THOSE WHO- HAD THE FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT WERE GRANTED THEIR TO SUBMIT TO A SYMPTOMATIC PERIODIC TESTING. WE YOU KNOW THIS THIS VIRUS IS OPPORTUNISTIC. AND IT LOOKS FOR EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THROUGH AND RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE BECAUSE THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING VERY WELL ON OUR CAMPUSES- WE'VE BEEN CONCERNED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. ABOUT AREN'T AREN'T NOT ONLY THE SAFETY OF FOLKS ON OUR CAMPUSES BUT THE SAFETY OF OUR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THE SOURCE OF- OF- OF INFECTION TO ARE SURROUNDED COMMITTEE MUNITY SAID WE HAVE FOUND THAT FROM THE BEGINNING THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT DRAKE. AND HIS TEAM- THAT ARE INFECTION RATES ON CAMPUS OUR OUR OUR WHOLE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BELOW THAT OF OUR SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AT LEAST- HI AND AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW WHAT THE SEPTEMBER REGENTS- WE HAD A PRESENTATION BY UC BERKELEY AND UC MERCED. ABOUT HOW- HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING UNDER CAMPUS EVERYBODY WAS HESITANT. RETURNING TO CAMPUS NO ONE WANTED ADD THAT TO NOT GO WELL TO STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR AND I MUST SAY- THINGS HAVE GONE WELL THERE'S YEAH HI AND OX AND EVERYBODY IS COMPLYING WITH THE PROTOCOLS. NOW REGARDING LEARNING- HI IT CHAIR MEDINA I I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT AT THE CONCERNS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS RAISED UP LEARNING IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON LEARNING CONTEXT. AND THE SHIFT TO PEOPLE'S HOME ENVIRONMENT WAS AN EVENLY EXPERIENCED BY OUR STUDENTS NOT EVERYBODY'S HOME ENVIRONMENT COULD BE ADAPTED TO OUR AND EFFECTIVE AND CONDUCIVE. ENVIRONMENTS FOR OPTIMAL LEARNING AND- AND MANY OF US KNOW ALSO THAT WE'RE. HAVING ON OUR CAMPUS NOW- FOR EXAMPLE AS- FOLKS THAT ARE ARE BEING ON THE K. FOR TO TIME. AND OUR AND SOME OF OUR FRESHMEN HAD FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN. EXPERIENCE IN PERSON MONEY ARE TRANSFER STUDENTS I HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IN PERSON LEARNING SO IT'S AN ADJUSTMENT. PERIOD- AND OUR END WE WERE IN A GLOBAL. AND SOAK EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS CONTINUITY OF LEARNING. THE ROUTE THE SAME PROCESSES WORK THE SECOND. IN REMOTE SO WE'RE ALL HAVING TO ADJUST TO NEW REALITIES OF BEING ON CAMPUS AND OUR CAMPUSES ARE LEARNING FROM EVEN AS THEY HAVE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THAT- ALL RIGHT ATTY AND I WILL SAY THAT- BECAUSE OF THE LEARNING LOSSES- IN LATER HIGH SCHOOL- ARE WE HAVE HAD TO AN APPROPRIATELY HAD BRIDGE PROGRAMS DURING THE SUMMER WE THINK THOSE WERE. VERY IMPORTANT TO MITIGATE THOSE LEARNING LOSSES WE DO THINK ADAM AT THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS OUR ONGOING WILL BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT STUDENT ACADEMIC- AS SUCCESS ON OUR CAMPUSES IN TRANSITION TO OUR CAMPUS WE DO WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT- AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO CONTAIN TO INVEST IN CLOSING EQUITY GAPS THAT WE HAVE TO. KEEP VIGILANT ABOUT THAT INVEST EVEN MORE SO- AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE HELP OF FIVE OF OUR OUR LEGISLATURE IN AND RECOGNIZING THOSE NEEDS AND HELPING US TO ADDRESS THEM FROM A STUDENT SENATE OUR POINT OF VIEW- A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS- AND MENTION THE END I AM- IN TERMS OF. ENROLLMENT LOSS WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT WE ARE COLLECTING- DATA ON THAT RIGHT NOW BY THE END OF NOVEMBER WILL ACTUALLY KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY LOSS IN ROME BUT WE EXPECT THAT THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT ARE YOU WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE HAD RECORD- ADMISSIONS ARE BOTH IN TERMS OF. THE OVERALL SIZE OF THOSE ADMISSIONS THE NUMBER CALIFORNIA- STUDENTS THAT WERE ADMITTED TO THE NUMBER TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT WERE MADE AT THE RECORD NUMBER OF ARE YOU AROUND STUDENTS THAT WERE ADMITTED OUT CLASSES WERE- WERE YOU ARE THEM AND- R. AND FIRSTHAND IN PAL THAT. FOR US BOTH IN TERMS OF PERCENT AND NUMBERS WERE WERE RE. IN AND WE ARE PROUD OF THAT. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STUDENTS HAVE AN EXCELLENT. AND APPROPRIATE EXPERIENCE OUT ON OUR CAMPUSES SO WELL WE'RE CHALLENGED TO BE INCLUSIVE OUR IN OUR PEDAGOGY INCLUSIVE YEAH- IN OUR SUPPORT- AND MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE DON'T LOSE THOSE GAMES- SOME. ARE OTHER THINGS I WILL SAY- WE ARE IN ACTIVE LEARNING ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THIS I'M PRESIDENT. AND I WE'D WE HAVE LEARNED IN BELIEVE THAT SUMMER. AND SUMMER COURSE WORK HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT- STUDENTS SEEM TO LOOK. AT LEAST WHEN WE WERE IN A REMOTE AREA- SEEM TO REALLY APPRECIATE IT BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN AND ADVANCE THEIR THEIR EDUCATION THROUGH SUMMER AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT- WE APPRECIATE OUR BY THE WAY I WANT TO MENTION DURING THE PANDEMIC- HI. THAT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN BASIC NEEDS FOR OUR STUDENTS AND NOT JUST OUR STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ACCOUNTS THE STUDENTS ARE HAS BEEN OF GREAT HELP AND SOLD LET ME THANK. YOU CHAIRMAN THIS COMMITTEE- AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND SONG FOR THAT KIND OF SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT- HI LET ME SAY THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT RECOVERY WE HAVE TO AND I AM SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS HERE WE HAVE TO RECOVER WITH WITH AN EQUITY MINDSET. ACT IN MY VIEW A CHAIR MEDINA- EDUCATIONAL EQUITY IS ONE OF THE IMPEATIVES OF OUR TIME- AND SO HOW DO WE BEST ENSURE. INCLUSIVE ACCESS. TO BAKE IT TO EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY THAT IS OUR CHALLENGE AND ACT IN EQUITY. IS CHEAP. EQUITY COSTS. AND THAT MEANS HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON IT FOCUSED ON THE WITH INTENTIONALITY AND BRING TO NOT ONLY DIRECT VISION BUT THE RIGHT WILL AND RESOURCES TO IT HIMSELF- ARE YOU WILL KNOW THAT WE ARE INVESTED AND ARE YOU SEE FOUR OUT. OF AT TWENTY THIRTY FRAMEWORK- WHICH IS FOCUSED ON EQUITY BOTH IN TERMS OF. THE STUDENTS WE HAVE MET THE DEGREES THAT WERE FOCUSED ON- AND GENERATING FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE CLOSING THE GRADUATION GAP FOR PALE FIRST CHEN AND- AND- UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND WE'RE INVESTING. IN DIVERSIFYING AND I BY THE WAY I APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT OF THIS ON DIVERSIFYING OUR PROFESSORIAL WE'RE MAKING GAINS HERE- BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO LET AT NILES THE TIME TO ACTUALLY REINVEST IN THAT WE DO HAVE A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY THERE. AND OUR FACULTY STAFF ARE DIVERSE THE FINE AND THAT IS IMPROVING AND THAT IS GOOD WE GOT TO SUSTAIN IT WE'VE GOT WE APPRECIATE THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN STATE THAT. BECAUSE OUT OUR EARLY OUT REACH OUT EARLY PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR K. TWELVE. BROTHERS IN IN EIGHT A. G. QUALITY EIGHT GB AND TAUGHT- ARE ENOUGH IN OUR TRANSFER TOOLS ARE BETTER OUT% REACH TO A BROADER RANGE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO THAT THEY'RE MORE REPRESENTED IN OUR UC SYSTEM. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE MUST BE FOCUSED ON EVEN AS WE DO THINGS LIKE HOW WE'VE PARTNERED WITH OUR STUDENT ASSOCIATION ON DOUBLING THE PAL. AND OUR PRESIDENT IS VERY INVESTED. IN CREATING A DEBT FREE PATHWAY OF FOUR OUT FOR QUALIFYING STUDENTS AND SO THAT WE ARE ABLE- ADDED TO F. AND LUMINATE A BARRIER OR CHALLENGE FOR STUDENTS ONCE THEY GRADUATE SO I HOPE I DIDN'T GO TOO MUCH OVER TIME- BUT THAT'S JUST A SNAPSHOT. SURE MEDINA. THANK YOU PROPOSED WILL GO DOWN TO DOCTOR ALTHOUGH. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU YEAH AND MEMBERS OF THE OPERA. YOU CAN DAY. I THOUGHT YEAH THAT COULD VICE CHANCELLOR FOR ACADEMIC EDUCATION. NUMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSITY. I WANT TO BEGIN BY SENDING TO YOU A WAR WELCOME FROM OUR FOR. WE WERE THE SACRAMENTO DOING IT CAN LIKE THIS IS. I VERY PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO FILL IN THE US CSU CON. I THINK WITH YOU THE I'M REALLY NEW FOR MY CURRENT ROLE. I'M STARTING MY. OKAY THANK YOU. I'M RELATIVELY NEW TO MY ROLE I AM BEGINNING MY FOURTH MONTH IN ON THIS THIS NEW ROLE. BUT I BRING THIRTY TWO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AND I SERVED AS THE PROVOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS AT CAL POLY POMONA BEFORE ASSUMING THIS ROLE AND SERVE THERE FOR SIX YEARS AND HELP CAL POLY POMONA NAVIGATE THE COVERT PANDEMIC. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON EACH OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE OPPOSED. R. TODAY ABOUT THE POST PANDEMIC UNIVERSITY. LET'S START WITH THE MANDATES AND PROCEDURES. FIRST I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. HAVE RESUMED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND ACTIVITIES AS OF THIS FALL. AS EXPECTED THERE'S VERY ABILITY ACROSS THE CAMPUSES DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING PHYSICAL SPACES AND REGIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. THAT BEING SAID. MOST OF THE COURSES TAUGHT IN THE CSU ARE OFFERED IN PERSON. AND MOST FACULTY AND STAFF ARE BACK ON CAMPUS AT VARIOUS INTERVALS. THANKS TO THE STRONG COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH AS WELL AS ONSITE VACCINE CLINICS AT EVERY CAMPUS. AN EXTRAORDINARY COOPERATION FROM OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITIES MORE THAN 95% OF OUR STUDENTS. AND 96% OF OUR EMPLOYEES. I HAVE MET THE CAMPUS VACCINATION POLICY. THOSE THAT RECEIVED AN APPROVED MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION. ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES INCLUDING ROUTINE TESTING AND REQUIRED MASK WEARING. I'D LIKE TO KNOW ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LEARNING LOSS AND THE EQUITY GAPS. AS WE RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF LEARNING LOSS ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. TO ADDRESS INEQUITY AND ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS COME TO US ACADEMICALLY PREPARED AND CONFIDENT AS LEARNERS AND SCHOLARS. WE ENCOURAGE OUR CAMPUSES THIS SUMMER TO USE FEDERAL FUNDS PROVIDED TO HIGHER ED TO INCREASE CAPACITY. AND PROVIDE STUDENT FEE WAIVERS FOR THE CSU EARLY START PROGRAM FOR MATH AND ENGLISH EDUCATION. ONE OF OUR TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE FIRST YEAR THE FIRST SEMESTER OF COLLEGE. CAMPUSES WERE ALSO ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE MORE INTENSIVE SUPPORT FOR INCOMING STUDENTS INCLUDING AND BETTING TUTORING. PROVIDING ACADEMIC COACHING CALLS SKILL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND ONLINE LEARNING SKILL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WE'VE ALSO CONTINUE TO OFFER FLEXIBILITY IN ADMISSIONS FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR. INCLUDING A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE USE OF THE A. C. T. M. SAT. EXAMS ADJUSTED MINIMUM GPA AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF CREDIT NO CREDIT GRADING IN A THROUGH G. HIGH SCHOOL COURSES AND TRANSFERABLE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES. THE APPLICATION PERIOD FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS CURRENTLY OPEN. AND WORKING VERY HARD TO SHARE THE NEWS WITH PERSPECTIVE STUDENTS AS WELL AS K. THROUGH TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATORS. IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC THE CSU SAW RECORD ENROLLMENT IN FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY. HOWEVER THIS FALL THE NUMBER SHOWS THAT WE'RE GENERALLY BACK TO THE FALL TWENTY NINETEEN LEVELS. WELL OUR TRANSFER STUDENTS REMAINED RELATIVELY STRONG OUR RETENTION RATE WAS DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY COHORT. AND WE HAD SEVERAL FEWER APPLICATIONS AND THE SMALLEST FIRST YEAR FRESHMAN CLASS SINCE TWENTY TWELVE. WITH THE RETURN OF HIGH TOUCH IN PERSON OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS COLLEGE PLAYERS AND ADVISING AND NOT WE CHECKED TIFFANY'S. WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED ENROLLMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. UNFORTUNATELY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS WERE MOST REFLECTED IN THESE DROPS. TO ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY WE HAVE INSTITUTED AN IMMEDIATE SYSTEM WIDE RE ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGN. TO REACH OUT TO OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE STOPPED OUT. I CONNECT THEM BACK WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO RETURN TO COLLEGE AND GET BACK ON TRACK. I'D LIKE TO SHARE NOW SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. THE PANDEMIC CREATED MANY CHALLENGES FOR ALL OF US. BUT ONE SILVER LINING IS THE GROWTH INNOVATION AND EXPANDED INTEREST IN ONLINE METHODS OF LEARNING AND STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES. I'M PROUD TO REPORT THAT MORE THAN 60% OF OUR INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY HAVE PARTICIPATED IN MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CUMULATIVE HOURS OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPTIMIZE THEIR VIRTUAL COURSES AND ENSURE ACTIVE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND EQUITY IN THE CLASSROOM. WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM MANY STUDENTS THAT THEY PREFERRED HAVING THE OPTION OF TAKING VIRTUAL COURSES BECAUSE OF THE ACCESS AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY PROVIDE. AS WE RESTORE RENEW AND RE IMAGINE INSTRUCTIONAL MODALITIES IN THE CSU. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO OFFER STUDENTS A RANGE OF MENTALITIES TO SUIT THEIR PREFERENCES AND NEEDS. JUST AS IMPORTANT TO STUDENT SUCCESS IS THE FULL MANY OF SUPPORT SERVICES THE STUDENTS NEED TO ENSURE THEIR SENSE OF BELONGING AND WELL BEING. AS WELL AS THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND ACADEMIC PROGRESS. FROM CHATBOTS TO TELEHEALTH ONLINE ADVISING AN E. SPORTS. OUR CAMPUSES THAT HAVE EMBRACED NEW TECHNOLOGY TOOLS THAT PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WITH GREATER ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES. AND FINALLY THE PIVOTAL VIRTUAL LEARNING AND SUPPORT ILLUMINATED TECHNOLOGY AS A BASIC STUDENT NEED. THROUGH OUR NEW C. SUCCESS INITIATIVE. EVERY INCOMING FIRST YEAR OR TRANSFER STUDENT AT PARTICIPATING CAMPUSES. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE A NEW IPAD AIR. APPLE PENCIL AND SMART KEYBOARD WHICH WILL BE THERE'S TO USE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR CSU UNDERGRADUATE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE. MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED RELIABLE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL DEVICES THIS FALL AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE RESULTS FROM PHASE ONE WILL INSPIRE. ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES ACROSS THE CSU TO JOIN FUTURE PHASES OF C. SUCCESS. I'D LIKE TO NOW ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF RECOVERY WITH ACCESS. THE CSU IS AN ENGINE FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY. AS OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. THAT PROPELS THEM INTO HIGHER ECONOMIC STRATUM. WE'RE PROUD THAT OUR STUDENTS REFLECT THE RICH DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE. WITH THE MOST ETHNICALLY ECONOMICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE UNIVERSITY STUDENT BODY IN THE NATION. ONE WAY WE ENABLE CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY IS BY CONTINUING OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR STUDENTS TO INCREASE THEIR RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES AND TO ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS. HERE I AM VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT DEGREE COMPLETION RATES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGHS FOR STUDENTS IN THE CSU FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS. IN FACT WE'RE GRADUATING APPROXIMATELY. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS THIS PAST YEAR THAN BEFORE OUR SIGNATURE STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORT WAS LAUNCHED. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS INCREASE IS EQUIVALENT TO GRADUATING ON ADDITIONAL CAMPUS THE SIZE OF SAKE FRESNO STATE EACH YEAR. SPECIFICALLY THE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATES FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS FIRST TIME STUDENTS HAS RISEN. FROM 19% 233% AND THE TWO YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS INCREASED FROM THIRTY ONE PERCENT. 46% HOWEVER EQUITY GAPS REMAIN VERY STUBBORN. AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORK TO DO TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS AND THIS IS BECOME OUR- PRIORITY IN THE CSU. THIS FALL WE UNVEILED AN EQUITY ACTION PLAN AIMED AT ACCELERATING OUR EFFORTS TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS. IN ADDITION TO SYSTEM WIDE RE ENROLLMENT CAMPAIGNS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE PLAN INCLUDES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AND WIDE USAGE OF DIGITAL DEGREE PLANNERS ACROSS ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. TO GIVE STUDENTS AN ACCURATE REAL TIME ROAD MAP. OF THE COURSES THEY NEED TO GRADUATE. EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO MAKE UP ACADEMIC CREDITS BY TAKING COURSES OVER THE SUMMER OR DURING OUR WINTER INTERSESSION. EFFORTS SHOULD DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN KEY COURSES WITH THE HIGHEST ENROLLMENT OF UNDERSERVED STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN RECEIVING TANF FOR WITHDRAWALS IN THESE COURSES WE NEED TO ADDRESS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THESE CLASSROOMS AND ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE. THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE CLASSES. THE ELIMINATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPEDE LOW INCOME AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS FROM PROGRESSING TOWARDS THEIR DEGREE. WE HAVE ALSO ASKED CAMPUSES DEVELOP THEIR OWN BOLD DATA DRIVEN ACTION PLANS TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND INCOME OR ZIP CODE. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN THE LIFELONG BENEFIT OF A CSU DEGREE. TO SUCCEED IN THE WORKFORCE AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STATE BRIGHT FUTURE. AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS PANDEMIC OUR GOAL IS TO EQUIP THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS THEY NEED TO ADVANCE EQUITY AND JUSTICE AND TO LEAD THE DIVERS AND TALENTED WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATION AND ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DR ALTHOUGH OUR NEXT PRESENTER DAVID O'BRIEN VICE CHANCELLOR OF GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY- I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE IN YOUR EXCELLENT TEAM OF CONSULTANTS FOR ACCOMMODATING OUR LAST MINUTE ADJUSTMENT AND APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF ACTING CHANCELLOR DR DAISY GONZALEZ WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. AND OF COURSE WISHING A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO CONSULTANCIES READING ALRIGHT I ALSO THINK CHANCELLOR ELOY ORTIZ OAKLEY OFFENSE RETURNED FROM SABBATICAL LATER THIS MONTH. AS WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BATTLE TWENTY. SIX BOTH COVER NINETEEN AND THE STUBBORN POVERTY CHALLENGES THAT CONTINUETO AFFECT OUR OST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AS THE SYSTEM THAT SERVES OVER 70% OF ALL PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE STEADFAST IN OUR COMMITMENT TO THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. DEPEND ON US FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND WE REMAIN UNAPOLOGETIC IN OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION ON THE ROLE THESE PLAY IN STUDENT SUCCESS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT. TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS ARE COLLEGES HAVE MADE. HISTORIC SYSTEM REFORMS. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS OUR COLLEGES HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS EARN COLLEGE CREDENTIALS BY TWENTY PERCENT. MEETING ONE OF THE SIX VISION FOR SUCCESS GOALS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE ESPECIALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN OTHERS ON THIS COMMITTEE. WE ABANDON THE PLACEMENT SYSTEM THAT FAILED STUDENTS SPIKE IN ACCURATELY MEASURING THEIR POTENTIAL REPLACING WTH ONE THAT IS LEADING TO A MORE EQUITABLE LEVEL ENGLISH AND WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO THIS WORK. NOW AS IT RELATES TO THE CODE. AND MAKE WHICH THE COMMITTEE ASKED ABOUT AS WE SIT HERE TODAY I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT. THREE QUARTERS OF OUR SEVENTY TWO COMMUNITY CALLED DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ENACTED A POLICY REQUIRING STUDENTS OR FACULTY TO BE VACCINATED AGAINST KOBE NINETEEN AS A CONDITION OF ATTENDING IN PERSON CLASSES OR RETURNING TO WORK ON CAMPUS. I WELL I DO WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT NEITHER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS. HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ENACT A BACKSEAT NEED A SYSTEM WIDE WE HAD STRONG. WORDS ARE INDEPENDENTLY GOVERNED DISTRICTS TO DO SO AND IT PROVIDED TECHNICAL AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE THAT DO. OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE REMAINED OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT THE ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES ARE STATE DEPENDS ON. AND I CANNOT THANK OUR FACULTY AWARDS LEADERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR STUDENTS ENOUGH FOR THEIR RESILIENCY. THIS FALL AS WITH OUR- OUR PARTNERS IN THE FOR YOUR SYSTEMS. COLLEGES BEGIN PHASING IN A HYBRID APPROACH WITH MANY COURSES CONTINUE TO VIRTUAL REALITY IN MANY MORE RETURNING IN PERSON. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING YOU WITH A SUMMARY OF PERSONALITY IN THE CHOICES STUDENTS ARE MAKING IT A REPORT THE LEGISLATURE NEXT MONTH. THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR CAMPUSES AND COMMUNITIES IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE OUR COLLEGES TO LISTEN TO THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF THEIR STUDENTS. AS THEY ADJUST TO THIS RETURN. MEMBERS CALL THE NOT CREATE NEW CHALLENGES OR INEQUITIES PERSIST IN OUR STUDENTS SO MUCH AS IT SHINED A SPOTLIGHT ON AND EXACERBATED IN MANY CASES THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE ALREADY THING. COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT NATIONWIDE HAS CONTINGENT HAS CONTINUED TO DECLINE THE DECLINE IT THAT BEGAN PRIOR TO VOTE WAS WORSENED BY THIS ONCE IN A CENTURY PANDEMIC. IN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE THE BEST ESTIMATE WERE ABLE TO GET WITH HER LATEST AVAILABLE DATA. IS THE TOTAL ENROLLMENT IN OUR SYSTEM DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 15% OR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY UP IN HERE TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND UNPACKING NUMBERS A BIT. WE SEE THAT THE STEEPEST DECLINES WERE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. ERIC CAN STUDENTS MAIL STILL. AND STUDENTS WHO ARE OUTSIDE WHAT WE CONSIDER TRADITIONAL COLLEGE GOING AGE IN PARTICULAR AMONG ALL STUDENTS AGE FORTY AND OLDER TOTAL ENROLLMENT DECLINED BY OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS OR NEARLY A THIRD OF THE OVERALL DECLINE. SH AND I CALL OTHER SPECIFIC CATEGORIES TO HIGHLIGHT OUR CHALLENGES AND KNOW THAT THIS IS WHO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE. OUR STUDENT POPULATION IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME STUDENTS OF COLOR WORKING STUDENTS STUDENTS RAISING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS STUDENTS WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS OR FROM AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY OR BACKGROUND AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THE PERSON HER FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. SO THESE DECLINES ARE HIGHLY WORKING TO US AND WE CAN'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE NOT FOR RECOGNIZING THIS TREND AND ALLOCATING NEW FUNDS IN THE BUDGET FOR OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT RECRUITMENT ENROLLMENT AND RETENTION. PRESS SECRETARY YEAH HOLD ON TO THE STUDENTS HOWEVER I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE CAN'T FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON A ROLL NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF OUTCOMES AND STUDENT SUCCESS. AND THIS MEANS ADDRESSING THE CRISIS OF AFFORDABILITY IN OUR STUDENTS BASIC NEEDS THAT IS FOR TOO LONG HOW ABOUT THE ABILITY OF STUDENTS TO SUCCEED IN OUR SYSTEM. I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK CHAIR MEDINA AS WELL AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY AND IN THE SENATE SOCCER LEYVA AND THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE FOR BEING CHAMPION OF CALIBRATE REFORM AND FOR SPEAKING OUT FOR MILLIONS OF STUDENTS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR STUDENTS IN MAKING MUCH NEEDED INVESTMENTS IN BASIC NEED CENTERS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. ON THIS COMMITTEE I ALSO JUST WANT TO SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZE DR ARAMBULA FOR LEADING LEGISLATION THIS YEAR TO CREATE A CRITICAL LIAISON BETWEEN OUR CAMPUSES AND COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES TO HELP STUDENTS APPLY FOR SERVICES LIKE CALFRESH AMONG OTHERS. AS NECESSARY AS THE USE AND OTHER NEW LEGISLATION AND INVESTMENTS ARE. WE CANNOT STOP THERE. WE MUST PRESS AHEAD AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR AN EQUITABLE. FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT ADDRESSES OUR STUDENTS TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE. OR AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT THE TO COST OF SIX. ON BASIC NEEDS WITH MY USE THE ARM FINE AND GUIDANCE FROM RELIGIOUS TO THE HOME FOR HOW WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WE KNOW THAT JUST AS IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WE'RE HEARING MORE AND MORE. DOCTORS NURSES AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS AND OTHERS TALK ABOUT THIS CONCEPT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THEIR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS. WHAT ELSE DOES THAT MEAN FOR US TO FOCUS RELENTLESSLY ON STUDENTS SUCCESS. IT MENS OUR COLLEGES MUST CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND BREAK DOWN BARRIERS AND SILOS AND WE MUST SUPPORT THEM FROM THE SYSTEM UPS AND STATE LEVEL. AMONG OTHER THINGS I'M PLEASED TO KNOW THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE BEATING A REPORT STREAMLINED PROJECT. TO ALLOW OUR COLLEGES TO MORE EFFICIENTLY REPORT OUT DATA ON PROGRAM OUTCOMES SO THEY CAN SPEND LESS TIME ON PAPERWORK AND COMPLIANCE AND RED TAPE. AND MORE TIME DIRECTLY SERVING STUDENTS. WE WERE ALSO PLEASED AND VERY APPRECIATIVE FOR AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF FUNDING TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTING GUIDED PATHWAYS IN OUR SYSTEM AS YOU KNOW GUIDED PATHWAYS IS THE FRAMEWORK BY WHICH WERE ADVANCING OUR VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND FINALLY. I WANT TO KNOW THAT ONE MORE COMPONENT AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO FOCUS RELENTLESSLY ON STUDENTS SUCCESS. THAT IS CENTRAL TO OUR EFFORTS IS OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING EVERY STUDENT WITH AN EQUITABLE CAMPUS AND CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT. TO DO SO WE MUST ACTIVELY BREAKDOWN SYSTEMIC RACISM IN ADVANCE ANTI RACIST EDUCATION REMISSION IS SUCH AS OUR NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS TO TAKE COURSES IN ETHNIC STUDIES. I THINK STUDIES OBVIOUSLY IS AN AREA THAT YOU'RE MEDINA IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF COURSE I WANT TO THANK OUR FACULTY FOR LEADING IN THIS AREA. YEAH I THINK STUDIES REQUIREMENT ENACTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS THIS- SUMMER WAS INITIATED LED BY FACULTY SUCH AS ACADEMIC SENATE PRESIDENT DORIS DAVIS AND- YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE NEXT PANEL. WE MUST ALSO CONTINUE EFFORTS TO DIVERSIFY OUR FACULTY AND STAFF SIMILAR TO OTHER THINGS THE PROPOSED BROWN MADE. TO THE UC SYSTEM WE HAVE OUR OWN PROJECT UNDER FIRST EQUITY. AND INCLUSION IS EVEN THOUGH WE CERTAINLY. STUDENTS COLOR AND I. SEVENTY OF FACULTY INTERESTED ARE WHITE. AND FINALLY WE MUST WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADVOCACY PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF ASSESSMENT. PLACEMENT AND RONIT ON EVERY CAMPUS AND THAT MEANS NOT JUST FULLY IMPLEMENTING BUT STRENGTHENING ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN OH FIVE. THE PIONEERING LEGISLATION WAS ADVANCED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI IRWIN AND THIS LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. MEMBERS THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MAJOR AREAS IN WHICH OUR SYSTEM CONTINUES TO WORSEN OUTLOOK FOCUSED NOT JUST ON IN WILMETTE PUT HONOR ROLE THAT YOU STUDENT SUCCESS. WE KNOW IT'S SIMPLY GETTING MORE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS YOU KNOW INCREASING THAT NUMBER ON THE SPREADSHEET PROCESS TOTAL HEADCOUNT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE MUST DEVOTE ALL OF OUR ENERGIES AND ATTENTION TO ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS ADDRESSING NOT JUST CRISIS SYSTEM BASIC NEEDS BUT THE CAUSES OF THAT CRISIS AND TO PROVIDING A SAFE AND EQUITABLE CAMPUS FOR ALL STUDENTS. THAT WILL REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF NOT JUST OUR SYSTEM COLLAGEN FACULTY LEADERS WHAT ALL OF YOU IS THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR TWO MILLION STUDENTS AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT WERE REQUIRE US TO IDENTIFY CHAMPIONS. FROM AMONG YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE SYSTEM BUDGET REQUEST WHICH SEEKS RESOURCES NOT JUST FOR A SYSTEM WHICH IS THE LOWEST FUNDED SYSTEM OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA ON A PER STUDENT BASIS. BUT FOR CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED UNDERSTAFFED CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WE'RE JUST ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EMPLOYEES OVERSEE THE LARGEST SYSTEM OF HIGHER. EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AND FOR CALLING THIS TOGETHER TODAY TO CONTINUE THIS ESSENTIAL CONVERSATION. ON HOW WE RECOVER EQUITABLY FROM COATED NINETEEN BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU DAVID FOR A FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WILL GO NEXT TO ALEX GRAVES VICE PRESIDENT FOR GOVERNMENTAL. RELATIONS THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT. CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHEN MEMBER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A BRIEF UPDATE. ON BEHALF OF THE STATE'S INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES MY NAME IS ALEX GRAVES HERE TODAY ON BEHALF F THE ICC U. R. SECTOR CURRENTLY SERVES NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES. OF WHICH 71% OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AS WELL AS ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS. IN MY TIME TODAY I'D LIKELY I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE STATUS OF STUDENT ROMAN AND PERSISTENCE THIS FALL. THE STRATEGIES AND TOOLS INSTITUTIONS ARE UTILIZING TO MAINTAIN A SAFE. AND HEALTHY CAMPUS COMMUNITY. AND HOW INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS EQUITY GAPS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE STATE'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY WORK. IN OCTOBER WE SAW A SHORT SIR. TO OUR INSTA. AND PREPARATION FOR THIS UP. FIFTY RESPONDED AND THE DATA AND THAT IN MY COMMENTS WILL BE BASED ON THOSE FINDINGS. I'VE ALSO PROVIDED COPIES OF A SHORTHAND OUT WE PREPARED FOR THIS DISCUSSION. LAST WEEK THE NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE RELEASED NEW DATA ON ENROLLMENT FINDING UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT NATIONALLY FELL THREE POINT 2% IN OUR SECTOR WE SEE SOME POSITIVE INDICATORS OR AT THE VERY LEAST SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN OUR UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT. OR AS THE MAJORITY OF INSTITUTIONS REPORTED ENROLLMENT DECLINES IN TWENTY TWENTY WE SEE MORE INSTITUTIONS REPORTING THE UNDERGRAD ROMIT HAS EITHER INCREASED OR STABLE AND FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL WELL WE FOUND THE MAJORITYOF INSTITUTIONS REPORT RELENTLESS STABLE ARE AT. A GREATER PROPORTION OF RESPONDENTS. INDICATED THAT ENROLLMENT WAS DOWN THIS YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR- CONSIDERING OUR SECTOR IS THE LARGEST- EDUCATOR OF GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE STATE INCLUDING THE LEADING PRODUCER OF NEW TEACHERS AND CONTRIBUTING MANY TO THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. THIS IS CERTAINLY A PATTERN WE WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR INTERNAL RESEARCH WORK. LOOKING AT STUDENT PERSISTENCE RATES THE MAJORITY INSTITUTIONS DID REPORT RATES THAT WERE STEADY OR HAVE INCREASED. HOWEVER ABOUT 42% DID REPORT DECREASED YEAR OVER YEAR PERSISTENCE RATES. INDICATING THAT THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK TO DO AN EXAMINING INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES AND SUPPORTS WILL ALSO TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO STOPPED OUT. TO RETURNING CONTINUE THEIR STUDIES. ALL INSTITUTIONS RESPONDING TO OUR SURVEY- DID INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE RESUMED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE OUR INSTITUTIONS WELCOME BACK STUDENTS THIS FALL TO FULLY IMMERSE THEMSELVES AND ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT OUR CAMPUSES OFFER. MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AS YOU MAY KNOW OUR RESIDENTIAL AND PROVIDE ON CAMPUS HOUSING AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THOSE SAID AT THE RESIDENCE HALLS ARE OPEN AT FULL CAPACITY. WITH MANY STUDENTS LIVING ON CAMPUS UNIVERSITIES ARE EMPLOYING A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS AS WELL AS OUR FACULTY AND STAFF. ARE INTERACTING IN A SAFE AND HEALTHY CAMPUS COMMUNITY. WE'RE PLEASED TO SHARE THAT THE MAJORITY REPORTED VACCINATION RATES WELL ABOVE 90% BOTH FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND FOR FACULTY AND STAFF. AROUND 73% OF INSTITUTIONS ARE REQUIRING PROOF OF VACCINATION FOR STUDENTS AND FACULTY OR STAFF. WITH ACCOMMODATIONS FOR VALID MEDICAL IN PERSON AND RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS. THE MOST COMMON PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGIES WE SEE INCLUDE VACCINE PROMOTION MASK REQUIREMENTS IN DURING CONGREGATE SETTINGS. PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND INCREASED VENTILATION CLEANING PROCEDURES RANGING FROM MORE FREQUENT CLEANING UP PUBLIC SPACES TO THE AVAILABILITY OF HAND SANITIZER ACROSS CAMPUS. WE'RE ALSO LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY AND THINGS LIKE SYMPTOMS SELF REPORTING OUT TO MUST BE UPDATED REGULARLY WITH ABOUT UTILIZING SOME FORM OF THOSE APPS AS WELL AS CONTACT TRACING. ADDITIONALLY ABOUT HOW FOR DOING SOME FORM OF MANDATORY TESTING. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT HEALTH IS NOT LIMITED TO PHYSICAL HEALTH. THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THOSE ARE CAMPUS. AND LAST YEAR AND A HALF WE LEARNED THAT TELEHEALTH WORKS THAT STUDENTS RESPONDED TO AN UTILIZED IT. AND THEY APPRECIATED THE ADDITIONAL PRIVACY OF NOT NECESSARILY HAVING TO VISIT A CAMPUS CENTER FOR AN APPOINTMENT. IN TALKING WITH SOME OF OUR STUDENT FARES DIRECTORS WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REQUESTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH STUDENTS BACK ON CAMPUS. 72% OF INSTITUTIONS RESPONDING TO OUR SURVEY INDICATED THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR SUCH SERVICES. GIVEN THE INCREASED WELLNESS NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE WORK TO SHIFT STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES. AS WELL AS CONTINUED UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH AS- AND THAT IS ONE OF MANY STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THIS IS PART OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO STUDENT BASIC NEEDS. INSTITUTIONAL STAFF HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN AN INCREASED NEED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT. MANY HAVE UTILIZED FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS AND ALSO WORKED AGGRESSIVELY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR NEED BASED AID. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO DID NOT FEEL THEIR EDUCATIONAL PURSUIT- EXCEEDING IT SEEMS TO NOT FEEL THEIR EDUCATIONAL PURSUIT WAS NO LONGER FINANCIALLY VIABLE. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE IMPACTS OF KOBE NINETEEN ARE NOT LIMITED TO THOSE STUDENTS WE CURRENTLY SERVE. BUT ALSO THOSE IN K. TWELVE WHOSE PATHS ARE BRINGING THEM CLOSER TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. WITH THE PASSAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AB ONE OH FOUR EARLIER THIS YEAR. AT LEAST THIRTY OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW ACCEPTING PASS NO PASS GRADES. AND WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ENSURE THEY'RE ALL LISTED ON THEIR WEBSITE. AND ALSO THAT OUR ADMISSION OFFICERS HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR LOCAL K. TWELVE PARTNERS ABOUT THAT CHANGE. WELL SOME OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WERE ALREADY TEST OPTIONAL PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. MANY MORE HAVE WAIVED SAT AND ACT REQUIREMENTS SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. BY OUR COUNT- FIFTY SEVEN OF OUR MEMBER INSTITUTIONS ARE NOW TESTOSYN ALLIES OF THIS ACADEMIC YEAR. WE DO NOT HAVE SYSTEM WIDE DATA ON THE IMPACT OF THIS SHIFT BUT WHAT WE HEAR AND TALKING WITH SEVERAL OF OUR MISSION OFFICES. IS THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR APPLICANT POOL INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH THIS CHANGE INCLUDING NOTABLE INCREASES IN APPLICATIONS FROM BLACK LATINO AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. AS THE STATE CONTINUES ITS WORK TO RECOVER WITH EQUITY. WE CONTINUE OUR WORK TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. WE SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE GOVERNOR'S RECOVERY WITH EQUITY TASK FORCE WHICH INCLUDED POMONA COLLEGE PRESIDENT GABRIELLE STAR. WE AGREED THAT THE PRESSING CONCERNS AFFORDABILITY AND WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING BASIC NEEDS THROUGH EFFORTS SUCH AS THE INTERSEGMENT ALL BASIC NEEDS WORKGROUP. WITH DR LINDA MAKE MURDOCH FROM MOUNT ST MARY'S UNIVERSITY PARTICIPATING ON BEHALF OF OUR SECTOR. WE ALSO KNOW THE QUALITY DATA IS CRITICAL FOR POLICYMAKERS AND PRACTITIONERS AND AICC YOU HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM WORKGROUP OVER THE LAST YEAR. WE ALSO SECURED A PLANNING GRANT FROM THE TEAGLE FOUNDATION TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS AND IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO STRENGTHEN. AND EXPAND TRANSFER OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR INSTITUTIONS. THIS WORK IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON TO HIGH NEED REGIONS THE INLAND EMPIRE. AND LOS ANGELES- WITH THE GOAL OF APPLYING FOR A LARGER IMPLEMENTATION GRANT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO EXPAND THIS WORK STATEWIDE. THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE DID PROVIDE THE FIRST INCREASE THE CAL GRANT A WORD FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING OUR SECTOR IN TWENTY YEARS. WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPORT THE WILL HELP FURTHER SUPPORTS STUDENTS AND THEIR PURSUIT OF AN EDUCATION. AICC REMAINS FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT RECENT FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS FOR FOSTER YOUTH. AND STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN. BOTH OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ATTENDING A UC OR CSU. IS EXPANDED TO PROVIDE SIMILAR INVESTMENTS IN THE STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO ATTEND ONE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AROUND THE STATE. THESE ARE BUT A FEW OF THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE WORKING TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S ROAD MAP TO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY. MUCH HAS BEEN DONE AND THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT OUR INSTITUTIONS REMAIN COMMITTED TO THEIR WORK REGIONALLY AND WITH THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO SHARE THESE UPDATES I'D BE HAPPY TO. TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ALEX AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS. IF THEY HAVE. ANY ANY QUESTIONS. DR WEBER. THANK YOU. THERE. THANK YOU CHAIR I'M IN THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO PRESENTED- TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATED HEARING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON IN EACH OF YOUR INSTITUTION I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE TO NOT ONLY KEEP OUR STUDENTS SAFE DURING THIS TIME BUT ALSO THE COMMUNITIES SAFE IT'S WHILE- BY ENCOURAGING VACCINATIONS AND ENCOURAGING MASK WEARING AN AND ALL OF THE OTHER. PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IN PLACE- TO HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS. I'M BEFORE I GUESS MY QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT I AM. CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES- WE ARE HERE TODAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON. IS- HOW TO RECOVER WITH EQUITY. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IN KEEPING EQUITY IN MIND AND KNOWLEDGE AND THE FACT THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE OFTEN TIMES THE DOOR TO HELP THOSE WHO WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. GET ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. YOU KNOW YOU HE I WAS LISTENING TO THE UC I'M REPORT AND- THEY HAVEN'T NOTICED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THEIR ENROLLMENT AND YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE AT OUR CSU SYSTEM. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU'VE HAD AT LEAST A 15% DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHERE IF ANYTHING WE NEED TO HAVE AN INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT. I'M IS VERY CONCERNING. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT IT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT WHAT POLICIES PROCEDURES AND WHAT WE CAN DO FROM A LEGISLATURE A LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT AND- BUDGETARY AB. STANDPOINT TO HELP- IT'S ALWAYS DISCOURAGING TO HEAR THAT. YOU KNOW THE AREA THAT PROBABLY NEEDS MORE SUPPORT IS GETTING THE LOWEST FUNDING AND THIS THE LOWEST STAFFED. WHEN WE REALLY IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT EDUCATION EQUITY. AND FOR ME WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE THAT YOU ALSO CAN LEAD TO HEALTHIER INDIVIDUALS AND HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES IN THE FUTURE. THEN WE REALLY NEED TO START GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT. FINDING THOSE AREAS EQUITABLY AS WELL. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS- SO YOU KNOW THE FIRST QUESTION IS THIS PANDEMIC IS HAS SHOWN ALL OF US IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO DO THINGS THE SAME AND I THINK THAT- EACH OF YOU HAVE TOUCHED ON THAT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT MODELS OF TEACHING DIFFERENT MODELS OF LEARNING. SO MY QUESTION FOR YOU MY FIRST QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAS BEEN ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT. CHANGING THAT TUITION STRUCTURE. FOR PEOPLE WHO WILL BE DOING. EITHER HYBRID OR ALL. DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE FUTURE. THAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I CAN GO AHEAD AND TAKE THE FIRST- RESPONSE THERE- YOU KNOW I THINK CERTAINLY- IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WITH THE TRANSITION TO- ONLINE REMOTE INSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW OUR OUR INSTITUTIONS PIVOTED QUICKLY. AND I THINK YOU KNOW EVERYONE RESPONDED- ENACTED- ADMIRABLY AND TRYING TO MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT QUICKLY ESPECIALLY FOR RELEASED MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WILL THAT ARE MORE THE- SMALLER CLASSES LIBERAL ARTS MODEL RIGHT THERE AREN'T IS. RELEASED BY THE PANDEMIC DID NOT USE ONLINE VIRTUAL- CLASSES AND IS MUCH ABUNDANCES PERHAPS OTHER INSTITUTIONS- I AM NOT AWARE OF- MANY IF ANY DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW AROUND TUITION RESETS OR THINGS LIKE THAT- CERTAINLY SEVERAL YEARS AGO I THINK PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR% WITH THE MILLS COLLEGE TUITION RESET THAT THEY WENT THROUGH- I DO KNOW THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT SEVERAL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS- IMPLEMENTED- ADDITIONAL TUITION DISCOUNT MEASURES. PARTICULARLY FOR REGIONAL STUDENTS BECAUSE MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE REGIONALLY SERVING- WHERE FOR EXAMPLE- IT MIGHT EVEN SAN DIEGO CHRISTIAN COLLEGE AND IN YOUR AREA OF THE STATE THAT OFFERED ESSENTIALLY- FINANCIAL AID- MATCH IF A STUDENT'S CAL GRANT ELIGIBLE IN THE REGION AND THAT THEY WOULD BASICALLY OFFER A COMPARABLE- ACCESS POINT FOR. STUDENTS TO IF THEY WERE TO ATTEND THE CSU- I THINK CERTAINLY WITH THE CHANGE AND- THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS OF SEEN AND IN OUR SURVEY WE DID FIND THAT A NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO CONTINUE USING- ONLINE LEARNING IN SOME FORM THAT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T BEFORE- THEY'LL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OPERATIONAL- BUDGETS AND NEEDS TO SERVE THEIR MISSION. IT'S THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND I'D LIKE TO ANSWER THROUGH THE CSU LANCE AND SHARE WITH YOU THAT. WE'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC AND COMMITTED TO KEEPING OUR TUITION FEES FLAT. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE TO ROUND OUT R. OR **** SO WE DO NOT HAVE PLANS TO INCREASE OUR TUITION FEES. ALL THE WHILE WE KNOW THAT COSTS ARE ALSO ACCELERATING INCLUDING THE COST OF TECHNOLOGY- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS THAT NEED TO BE MADE TO OFFER. QUALITY ONLINE DIGITAL EXPERIENCES FOR OUR STUDENTS. I DO WANT TO REFLECT ON SOME WAYS IN WHICH WE TRY TO EXPAND- ECONOMIC RELIEF TO STUDENTS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IN PARTICULAR. WHEN I WAS AT THE POMONA CAMPUS WE- WEIGHT OF ALL COURSE FEES WHERE STUDENTS PAID ADDITIONAL COURSE FEES BECAUSE THEY WERE IN A- IN A LAB FOR A STUDIO WHERE THERE WERE CONSUMABLE MATERIALS THAT NEEDED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN. BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T COMING TO THE LAB THROUGH THE STUDIOS THOSE FEES WERE WAIVED AND NOT CHARGE THE STUDENTS. SEMELE BECAUSE STUDENTS WERE NOT COMING ON TO THE CAMPUS IS THINGS LIKE THE RECREATION FEE A STUDENT FEES TO USE THAT ATHLETIC FACILITIES ALL OF THOSE WERE REIMBURSED BACK TO THE STUDENTS. SO WE TRY TO LOOK TO SEE WHERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO- BUT THE REIMBURSEMENT BACK TO THE STUDENTS. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE FOR OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM- YOU SEE IS STILL ON STOP GO TO MY SECOND QUESTION- YOU ARE A GREAT YEAH YES DOCTOR ARE WEBER IF I COULD JUST WAY AND COULD I PUT AN UNDERSCORE ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE GOT SYLVIA ARAMBULA HAD TO SAY OUR CHIEF YOU TALKED ABOUT QUALITY ONLINE DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND I WANT TO SAY THAT I'D PUT THE EMPHASIS ON THE QUALITY ASPECT. THAT THERE IS A HUNGER NOT JUST FOR INCLUDES OF ACCESS TO ANY EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE THERE'S A HUNGER FOR INCLUSIVE ACCESS TO EXCELLENT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES AND WHETHER WHETHER IT'S IN PERSON OR- ALL OVER OUR- DIGITAL. SO X. ALL. REQUIRED INVESTMENT TIME EXPERTISE MONEY AND RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY AND ARE IN IN OUR EXPERIENCE THE WHAT THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF THOSE EXPERIENCES ARE NOT NECESSARILY CHEAPER THEY ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE. SO HI WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT FOR MARIN ANALYSIS AT THIS TIME- WITH THE EMPHASIS ON PROVIDING PARTICULARLY IF YOU WANT TO DO IT INCLUDES NETFLIX ARE- IT IT ACTUALLY MIGHT TAKE MORE RESOURCES SO WE'RE WE'RE WE RECOGNIZE THE PARAMETERS OF THE STATE WE RECOGNIZE THE PARAMETERS OF TUITION. AND WE RECOGNIZE THE PARAMETERS OF OUR HOME RESOURCE GARNERING OPPORTUNITIES BUT OUR GOAL IS TO MARSHAL ALL THOSE RESOURCES TO PROVIDING EXCELLENCE IN- IN THAT. IN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE EVEN. IN THE DIGITAL SPACE. THANK YOU SO MY SECOND ASKED SPECIFICALLY FOR UC AND CSU BECAUSE I HEARD THE OTHER TO KIND OF TOUCH ON THIS ALREADY IN THEIR PRESENTATION- WE KNOW THAT TE PANDEMIC- HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT- DISTRESS AMONGST. PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE AND EVERYONE HANDLES IT DIFFERENTLY- YOU SEEN A SPIKE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OVER THIS TIME PERIOD AS WELL AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF I COULD HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SERVICE IF THE IF THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE. IN THE AMOUNT OF SERVICES IN THE PROVIDERS THAT YOU ALL HAVE HAD- ON EACH OF YOUR CAMPUSES. DOCTOR BROWN WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR ON ON OUR- IN OUR CAMPUSES WE HAVE FOUND AN INCREASED NEED- I AND IT'S WHY IT'S- OUR FOR OUR- OUR AND FRESHMAN ARE ENTRY STUDENTS ARE TRANSFER STUDENTS. ARE GRADUATE STUDENTS WE'VE ALSO FOUND INCREASED MEDIA. OUR STAFF AND OUR FACULTY AS WELL THIS IS A STRESSFUL TIME WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WITH THIS IS I'M PRESIDENT IN MY LIFETIME I'VE I'M NOT EVERY EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND- I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST SO ALL RIGHT I HAVE STUDIED THE HISTORY OF THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF MARSHFIELD AND IT PARALLELED OTHER TIMES OF GREAT TRANSITION. IN SOCIETY SO WE ARE IN THE- I'LL ARE VERY CHALLENGING PERIOD OF TIME IT IS NATURAL THAT PEOPLE AREN'T. NEED SUPPORT- AND RESOURCES TO COPE WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES% SANDWICHED ARE NEW AND UNPRECEDENTED MAY NEED TIME AND COPING SKILLS TO ADDRESS THEM WE HAVE ARE ARE EXPLORED MULTIPLE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF PROVIDING THOSE SUPPORT INCLUDING TELEHEALTH OUT OF FORMS OF- OF- OF SERVICES WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A TIME FOR BECAUSE OF SO MUCH OF THESE- OUT OF THOSE STRESSES AND EXPERIENCES WERE FILLED. IN PHILLY THERE'S SOCIAL ISOLATION ACCOUNT ACCOMPANYING THOSE THINGS THAT THE ROLE OF GROUP OUT AND KIND OF COUNSELING SERVICES IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE BRINGING BACK. OUR IN OUR OUR MOMENTUM OF PROVIDING SUPPORT SERVICES AND ARE AND- WE SHOULD BE ENGAGED IN OUR CYCLE EDUCATIONAL AND OUTREACH KIND OF SERVICES AS WELL SO AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I SEE HAPPENING. ON OUR ON OUR CAMPUSES. THANK YOU DR. LET ME LET ME ALL ELABORATE ON THE IN. OF TELEHEALTH AND- ITS USE AS THE DIGITAL OF VEHICLE TO SUIT THAT STUDENTS CAN USE TO ACCESS THESE KEY SERVICES ALMOST ON- UBIQUITOUS WAY GIVEN- THEY'RE DIGITALLY MEDIATED. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE MADE IN PROVIDING DIRECT SUPPORT FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND AS WE VISITED JUST RECENTLY- TO NEIGHBORING CSU CAMPUSES. THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDING CULTURALLY COMPETENT AND DIVERSE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO THE WORK FORCE WAS JUST VERY EVIDENT IN EVERY CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD BOTH WITH STUDENTS AS WELL WITH AS WITH THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. SO THIS INVESTMENT WILL MAKE IMPORTANT INROADS IN EXPANDING THAT T. WORK FORCE BUT IN ADDITION TO PERSONALITY THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. STUDENTS SHOW UP ALONG THE CONTINUUM SOME WILL NEED CRISIS IMMEDIATE- ASSISTANCE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON WELLNESS AND PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE HOW ON OUR CAMPUSES THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS EVIDENT IN THE STRATEGIES AT THEIR UNFOLDING ON THE CAMPUSES. AND SO IT IN ADDITION TO THAT CONTINUUM I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I'M SEEING. IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COORDINATED CARE UNITS SO THAT MENTAL HEALTH BASIC NEEDS PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. ALL OR WRAPPED AROUND IN THE HOME SO THAT WHETHER IT'S A FACULTY MEMBER WHO SENT AN ALERT OR STUDENT WHO SHOWS UP IN ONE OF THESE AREAS. THERE'S COORDINATION AND RESPECT FOR PRIVACY BUT ALSO- RESPONSIVENESS THE ABILITY TO THEN RESPOND TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUES THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO THIS COORDINATED CARE MODEL IS SOMETHING WOULD WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND AT ALL OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES. THANK YOU. RIGHT RIGHT. THANK YOU SIR GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY. AND ALL THE PRESENTERS WHO ARE MADE THE PRESENTATIONS- AS A VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE I HAVE TO COME HERE- TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY AND THE CERTAINLY AN OLDER LOVER SOLVE ALL- EDUCATION FROM PRE K. TO. COLLEGE GRADUATE SCHOOL. WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT DISCIPLINE THAT MAKE AND THEN I'LL HOPEFULLY WE CAN CALL IT TOUGH FOURTH DEPENDENT AND THEN THE CAMERA HOW WE CAN. ARE SOME THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT WE HAVE ONE AND ENCOUNTERS. MMHM MANY- TOPICS- THAT THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED. A COUPLE OF AREAS SOMEONE OFF- THE CHARM- MANY OF YOU- THE ESTIMATED AFTER LEARNING GAPS AND EQUITY GAPS. AND IF YOU CAN DEFINE LEARNING GAPS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT- FOR THOSE WHO ARE. FOR PRESIDENT DONALD IN PERSON IN CLASS AND FOR THOSE SO WHO WERE LEARNING ONLINE. I TALK ABOUT THE GAPS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. AND THEN ALSO EQUITY GAPS A SEDAN OR SIMILAR TERM- HOW DO YOU MANAGER. I'M I'M SURE WE CAN ALL ON- ANTICIPATED MUST BE SOME DIFFERENCES SO INEFFECTIVE- ARE LEARNING BETWEEN NOW ONLINE IN PERSON- ONLINE. AND- I WAS THE SOME TO LEARN BETTER OR NINE SOME DON'T. AND RIGHT NOW STATE LAW THE TO ARE FORMS OF LEARNING. CLASSROOM IS GOING ON DEPENDING UPON THEIR TORIES OR DEPEND UPON AUDIO VACCINATION- MANDATE THE REQUIREMENT OF WAR REFUSAL OF THAT UP. SO EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF- THIS- PANDEMIC- ARE GOING ON HAVE YOU HAD ANY TOURISTS- TO MANAGE WITHOUT THOSE SISTER LEARNING GAP LAW EQUITY GAPS. AND ONLINE THAT'S A BIG GAS SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE- MAYBE AND- SO SHAKEN BACKGROUNDS RACIAL BACKGROUND DIFFERENCES INCOME VARIANCES ZIP CODES ARE VERY SERIOUS OF. JENDA VARIANCES SO THE ALL KINDS OF THINGS WE CAN ANALYZE BUT THE IN TERMS OF ALL WHAT THE- IT IS THAT THE LEARNING KNOWLEDGE OF HOW DID YOU MEASURE THAT OR DID YOU DID YOU MANAGER THAT'S THE POOL NOT CHOPPED LANDING- HOW MANY GRADUATES SO DURING THAT TIME TO MAKE YOUR WITH THE LOCAL LAST YEAR HAVE LANDED ON JOBS- WAS THAT PART OF THE- EQUITY MANAGEMENT TOOL. IN ALL IF YOU CAN DEFINE HELLO HOW ARE YOU GONNA- PROVIDE THAT TO A CLEAR DEFINITION AND THE HOW YOU ARE TAPPED YOU KNOW THE ONES TO MANAGER AND THE WHAT YOU GONNA. DO ABOUT THE FINDINGS. IF I MAY. SALOMEA A YEAR I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION IN TERMS OF BOTH. BEING ON THE SAME PAGE AND IN HOW WE DEFINE THESE CONCEPTS BUT ALSO HOW WE'D GO ABOUT MEASURING THEM AND ENSURING ALL IMPROVEMENTS OR CHANGES ALONG THESE METRICS. WHEN WE WERE FOR TO LEARNING GAPS THROUGH S. WHEN I REFER TO IT IN MY PRESENTATION. I WAS NOT MAKING A COMPARISON OF ONLINE VERSUS FACE TO FACE. THE WAY I WAS USING LEARNING GAPS WAS WHAT WHAT EXPERIENCE WHAT KNOWLEDGE WHAT SKILLS DO OUR STUDENTS. COME TO US WITH ON DAY ONE. AND WE HAVE- IS YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS AGO MADE A COMMITMENT TO ELIMINATE REMEDIAL EDUCATION. WE MEET THE STUDENTS WHERE THEIR ACT AND DETERMINE WHERE THEY'RE AT USING A STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED IN HIGH SCHOOL TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF READINESS IN MATH AND ENGLISH THERE IN. AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THESE MORE RECENT INCOMING CALL FORTH. IS THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN STUDENTS WHO ARE BASED ON STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES PERFORMANCE IN THESE KEY COURSES PERFORMING. AT A- AND A FULL LOWER LEVEL ON THAT CONTINUUM. WHAT THAT MEANS THEN IS THAT WE NEED TO MEET THE FINS WHETHER ACT IN INSURE THAT IN THE SUMMER AS THEY TRANSITION IN. AND IN THEIR FIRST YEAR THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO CATCH UP AND BE READY TO CONTINUE TO EXCEL IN THEIR COLLEGE WORK. WHEN WE USE IN THE CSU THE CONCEPT OF EQUITY GAPS. IF INFORMED BY OUR SYSTEM WIDE INITIATIVES THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WHERE WE LOOK AT THE RETENTION AND GRADUATION RATES. OF STUDENTS IN AGGREGATE. BUT WE ALSO BREAK THEM DOWN AND SEE ARE THERE DIFFERENCES. WITHIN THAT GROUP BY PELL ELIGIBILITY FINANCIAL- WRITTEN YOU KNOW FINANCIAL SUPPORT. AS WELL AS RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND GRADUATE AT HIGH LEVELS IN THE CSU AND THAT WE CLOSE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN- IN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND ALL OTHER SCHEMES. YEAH DR CHOI IF IT'S POSSIBLE I TO ADDRESS THIS FROM A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES PERSPECTIVE- REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT EQUITY GAPS. IT'S HARD FOR ME NOT TO RESPOND TO THAT BY SAYING SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF EQUITY GAPS IS THE NAME OF THE GAME. FOR OUR SYSTEM BUT IT REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT OUR SYSTEM. STRUGGLES WITH PERSISTENTLY- WE SEE GAPS ARE EQUITY GAPS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO- THE REFERENCE TO DR ALBUMS MAJOR MEDIA EDUCATION RESONATED WITH US BECAUSE- WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT- AND WORK HARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEM IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. CONSISTENT MACKEREL PLACEMENT WE KNOW THAT A DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBER OF OUR BLACK CAN LET NEXT STUDENTS AND THE STUDENTS OF COLOR ON HER MOTHER FROM A DESERT REGIONS- ARE PLACED INTO REMEDIAL COURSES WORKSHOP MORE OFTEN THAN NOT MAKE THEM LESS LIKELY. TO SUCCEED IN DIRECTLY TRANSFER LEVEL ARE WHAT WE CALL COLLEGE LEVEL TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND NOW. WE SEE EQUITY GAPS IN TRANSFER ITSELF YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT TIME THE LEGISLATURE IS MADE A BIG PRIORITY OUT OF- STREAMLINING THE TRANSFER PROCESS INCREASING THERE IS WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE. FOR THE SALVATION OF THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER IN TWENTY TEN FOR THE ENACTMENT OF SOMETHING- NINE TWENTY EIGHT OF THIS YEAR. BUT DESPITE HAVING HAD THAT ETP ASSOCIATED TRANSPLANT OVER A DECADE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GAINS TEARS ONE EXAMPLE FOR BLACK STUDENTS WHICH IS A PROBLEM FOR US AND FOR OUR SYSTEM- THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD NOTICE IS THE MAJOR SYSTEM WIDE EQUITY GAP BUT WE STILL HAVE. ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID YOU KNOW DESPITE SERVING A LARGER SHARE OF STUDENTS THAT ARE LOW INCOME WE ACTUALLY HAVE A MUCH LOWER PERCENTAGE OF OUR STUDENTS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A STEAK CAL GRANT WHICH IS OUR- PRIMARY STATE FUNDED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM. IN OUR FOR YOUR PARTNERS DO SO EQUITY GAPS ARE CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM THERE THEY ARE PERSISTENT IN FINDING- AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK PART OF THOSE EVERY. DAY SUCKERS AT THE QUESTION. CHRISTCHURCH ALL RIGHT I WOULD ADD. TO MIGHT. HAVE ALREADY I THOUGHT WONDER SAID. IS A YOUR QUITE. ARM ONE OF THE- OF IT IS HOW DO YOU KNOW. IN AND MAYBE EVEN ARE YOU CAN ADD TO THAT WHEN DO YOU KNOW. BECAUSE IF YOU IF YOU NOTICE SOME OF. THE FEATURES WE LOOK AT THEIR MULTIPLE FEATURES. OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT. WHAT GRADES A PERSON IS OUT AS STUDENTS ARE GETTING INTO CLASS OR NOT YOU CAN LOOK AT WHETHER THEY MOVE FROM OUT. FROM A PRETTY MAJOR TO- ADD TO THE MAJOR ARE YOU CAN LOOK AT WHETHER THEY ARE RETAIN THE FIRST YEAR WHEN THEY GRADUATE WITHIN A PARTICULAR TO. PEER TO TIME LAPSE THERE'S MULTIPLE FEATURES TO THAT MATTER TO ALL OF US IN TERMS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STUDENTS. AND WHEN WE SEE OUR- OUT FEATURES ASSOCIATED THAT THAT OUT THERE ALSO TRACK WITH STUDENT SOCIAL DEMOGRAPHICS. THAT'S A CONCERN TO US. IT'S A CONCERN TO MY GOLLY IT'S A TO US AND SEE SOME. AND WE'RE- IN WIND FIND THEM TO FIND THE SOURCES I'M NOT ONLY ARE THOSE CAUSES MOBILITY. NOT ONLY ARE THE GAPS THEMSELVES MULTIPLE IN NATURE BUT THERE COULD BE MULTIPLE TO COST TO AND SO THAT'S WHAT IT ACTUALLY TAKES SOME TIME SOME STUDIES OUR ON GOING TO- TO LEARN WHAT THEIR SECURITY THAT HAVE ROCKED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. AND TO- AT AND WE'RE GOING TO BE FIXING THE PLANE EVEN AS WE- AS WE'RE DRIVE FINE- SO THAT AS WE GO ON WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO IMPROVE- THE STATE OF STUDENT EXPERIENCES I'M NOT I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR ALL MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I. HEARING AND- BUT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN MORE AS TIME GOES ON ABOUT WHAT SOME TO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS ARE OUT WHO IT IS DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTING AND HOW BEST TO TARGET AND TAILOR AND VIC. INTERVENTIONS AS WE MOVE FURTHER. THE GENTLEMAN YOU- THAT ME THIS I AFTER GAP UP DON'T KNOW THE U. K. ATTRIBUTE. CALL THE NINETEEN. AS A FULL COSTA FOR SUCH A AT THE DATE GAP WOULD YOU AGREE TO THAT. I WOULDN'T INTO EQUITY GAP BY EXISTED EVEN BEFORE BEFORE LONG BEFORE THIS BEEN DAMAGED. AND I KNOWN AS A PART OF THE MEASURE A TOOL TOOL- NARAL ELIMINATE THAT KIND OF GAP. NO LEGISLATURE PASSED A BILL AND DON ALSO USES SYSTEM ALREADY ADOPTED THE POLICY. FOR A COMMISSION STAND OUT THOUGH ONE OF THE ACADEMIC OF POTENTIAL GAUGE AS A T. WHILE IS TO T. HAS BEEN ELIMINATED. NO THAT CONCERNS ME A LOT. D. FOR THOSE TOURS. ARE PROVIDED. SOME OF THE MEASUREMENT FOR SUCCESS IN COLLEGE A LOT OF. AND SO TO SPEAK A POTENTIAL ACADEMICALLY CAPABLE PREPARED. PEOPLE WERE ACCEPTED THE ACCORDING TO THEIR UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE LEVEL SOMEWHAT HIGHER SOME MORAL. AND THE WHEN THEY ARE IN THE- SIMILAR GROUP. THE ACT TO CAP OR THE LOWER. BUT NOT ALWAYS- THAT BACK AT THEM MEASUREMENT TOOLS SOFT ELIMINATED. WHAT KIND OF A TOWERS SO ON MISSION TOUR SO I WILL NOT YOU'LL SELL ONLY GPAS WHAT RECOMMENDATION LETTER OF LETTERS. ALL PONDERED THIS YEAR I MEAN TO ME. THAT IS SO LIKE TO EMBRACING ANYBODY FORCES COMPROMISE PUNE OFFLINE I'M NOT GOING TO MEASURE YOUR ACADEMIC POTENTIAL ABILITY. AND THAT WILL CREATE THE EVEN FOR THE ACCIDENT GAPS BECAUSE SOME ARE PREPARED THIS AMOUNT COMMENTATOR SOMEONE UP. WE THINK ABOUT THAT DOCTOR DOCTOR CHOI- I AM I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR INSIGHTFUL QUESTIONS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- WITHOUT RESPECT TO MY VICE CHAIR- WILL BE BACK WE'LL BE BACK IN JANUARY WILL BE HAVING MORE OF MEETINGS OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND THE QUESTION THAT YOU POSE RIGHT NOW. DR CHOI I THINK IT IS A VERY- IT'S A GOOD QUESTION VERY GOOD QUESTION AND DESERVING OF THE ANSWERS FROM- OUR SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION BUT IN THIS HEARING IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. IF THAT'S ALRIGHT DR JOY. AND PROMISE YOU THAT WE'LL HAVE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THAT. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO ASK A QUESTION AND I WANT TO WOULD BE FIRST BEFORE I ASK ONE QUESTION. I WANT TO SAY THAT MY- MY- DISTRICT OFFICE IS FIVE MINUTES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. AND I RECENTLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE THEIR- FIRST TIME SINCE THE PANDEMIC. WITH STUDENTS PRESENT. AND WHAT A GREAT FEELING THAT WAS WHAT A GREAT FEELING IT WAS TO BE WITH OUR CHANCELLOR THERE. HAD THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AT CAL- WAS THERE RECENTLY FOR A FOOTBALL GAME AND THEN MOST RECENTLY AT STANFORD- LAST SATURDAY. AND THE PRESIDENT OF STANFORD SHARE WHAT HE SAID IS THE JOY. OF BEING ON CAMPUS THE JOY THAT IS BEEN FELT BY FACULTY STUDENTS AND STAFF SO I FELT THAT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MY FUTURE VISITS ARE MEANT TO BE AT UC SAN DIEGO. AND CAL STATE FULLERTON IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT MY ONE QUESTION THAT I WANT TO ASK EVERYONE- BUT RECENT WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTED HOW DISABLED STUDENTS. HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND ON THE RETURNS TO CAMPUS SPECIFICALLY THE LACK OF RESOURCE RESOURCES FOR SUPPORT IN THE CLASSROOM. AND ONLINE SUPPORTS AND THE FEAR RETURNING TO CAP TO THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMUNE COMPROMISED SITUATION. SO MY QUESTION IF WE COULD KIND OF QUICKLY WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ENSURE. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA RETURNED ON CAMPUS LEARNING SO THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE BEING PROVIDED EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES. TO ENGAGE IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE COULD MAYBE JUST GO QUICKLY THROUGH ALL THREE SEGMENTS- WHEN I START WITH. THE PROGRAMS BROWN IF YOU DON'T MIND. APPROACH GROUP YOU'RE ON MUTE. EXCUSE ME I WAS SAYING I REALLY APPRECIATE TO QUESTION CHAIR MEDINA AND ARE. OUR THE QUESTION ITSELF INDICATES THAT NOT EVERYBODY EXPERIENCES THE SAME ENVIRONMENT THE SAME WAY AND ART AND HERE WE ARE RETURNING TO OUR ON CAMPUS LIFE AND SOME OF OUR STUDENTS WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF DIFFERENT ABILITIES ARE WERE EXPERIENCING REMOTE ENVIRONMENT ACTUALLY AS- AS AS MORE- CONDUCIVE TO THEIR NOSE AT AND- AND NOW- RETURNING TO CAMPUS. THEY DON'T WANT TO. THE TO CA. WE GOING TO HAVE TO- AT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE ROBUST A DISABLED STUDENT SERVICES PROGRAMS AND ARE ALL OF THIS WORK OUT. VERY HARD TO WANT TO RESOURCE THOSE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO SERVE STUDENT NEEDS AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY YES. IT'S VERY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT- WE ACTIVELY WORK WITH EVERYONE OF OUR STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IS AT THE BOTTOM POINT TO THEM SO THIS IS AN ACTIVE AREA OF YOU CAN ONLY INVESTMENT BUT OF CONCERN. AND R. AS WE TRANSITION BACK BUT IT OUT BUT ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE THIS ON THEIR RADAR SCREEN. DOCTOR ARE REAL. HELLO BUT LONG. YOUR PROBLEMS ARE I THINK WHAT. DOCTOR BROWN HAS UNDER IS REALLY THE KEY POINT IN THAT IS THAT THIS IS AN ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUE. AND THAT STUDENTS WHO COME TO US WITH A VARIETY OF DISABILITIES OR WORK OR CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS LEARNING IN THE QUOTE TRADITIONAL WAY. WE NEED TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE FINDING FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT WHEN WE STARTED TO PLAN FOR THE RE POPULATION OF OUR STUDENTS. WE HAVE TO INVEST IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF MASS FOR OF INSTRUCTORS WHO NEED HELP STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS IN THEIR CLASSROOM NEEDED TO READ THEIR LIPS. OR ON TRANSLATORS SO IT'S A REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THOSE STUDENTS. BUT ALSO. RECOGNIZING AS WAS POINTED OUT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME STUDENTS WHO. WHO MAY HAVE. MOBILITY CHALLENGES WHO MAY FIND IT MORE CONVENIENT TO ACCESS HIGHER ED THROUGH. DIGITAL MEDIATED FORMATS SO I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HIGHER IT HAS. IS TO PROVIDE. MORE FLEXIBLE. AND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY FORMS OF INSTRUCTION. AND THOSE MODALITIES I THINK POST PANDEMIC ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE VERY. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT. WITH THAT COMES A COMMITMENT TO THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ACCESS TO THIS VARIOUS MODALITIES. THANK YOU AND THEN GOING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. DAVID YOU'RE THERE. YES CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH THE OTHER IS A GREAT QUESTION IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WON'T REPEAT TOO MUCH OF WHAT PROGRAMS BROWN- DR ALVA SAID BECAUSE I THINK WE- ACTIVE COULD NOT AGREE MORE WITH WHAT THEY EACH SIDE YOU KNOW IT'S IT REALLY IS DEPENDENT ON INDIVIDUAL STUDENT NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION- AND THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO ADAPT TO THIS NEW REALITY. IT NEEDS TO BE STUDENT VOICES DRIVING THESE DECISIONS RIGHT IN IN THE ROOM AND CENTER- FORMER PRESIDENT THE STUDENT CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE TO SAY A NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US WE COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND I KNOW THE OTHER SYSTEMS WORD OUT AS WELL AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENGAGE WITH OUR FACULTY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE IN THE CLASSROOM WHETHER VIRTUAL OR IN PERSON WITH THE STUDENTS AND ENSURE. THAT THEIR- THAT THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR VOICES AND FEEDBACK IS- IS BEING YOU KNOW- PRIORITIZE THE PURPOSE CONVERSATION BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION LOOKS LIKE IS ONE THAT IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY INCLUSIVE AND RECOGNIZES THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WITH ANY KIND OF DISABILITY HALF. THANK YOU AND ALEX REALLY INDEPENDENCE I MEAN I WOULD ECHO MUCH OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT- FOR DISABLED STUDENTS AT FACULTY STAFF AS WELL AS- ARE IMMUNE COMPROMISED STUDENTS FACULTY AND STAFF- I THINK IS OTHERS MENTIONED OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING PROVIDE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE- VOTE FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND CLASSES REMOTELY IF THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE BEING ON CAMPUS FOR WHATEVER REASON- OR IT'S EASIER FOR THEM TO ACCESS THEIR COURSES OR OTHER SERVICES FROM HOME. SAME THING FOR OUR FACULTY AND STAFF A NUMBER OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OF IMPLEMENTED FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL FOR THOSE WHO MAKE IMMUNO COMPROMISED OR OTHERWISE- AND I THINK IT ALSO WILL DEPEND YOU KNOW- WE HAVE MANY INSTITUTIONS AND. AND LOS ANGELES AREA SAN DIEGO AND OTHER THE STATE THAT. HAVE WHETHER THAT'S MORE CONDUCIVE TO OUTDOOR. WHICH MAY OF OUR ANSWER. OF A- AS A STRATEGY. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW THAT IS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF- NOT ONLY MODALITY THAT PLACE- I THINK IS ANOTHER THING THAT STUDENTS WILL CONSIDER INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING TO. WORK THROUGH TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT EVERYONE FEELS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE ON OUR CAMPUS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSES I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. IT IS UP TO DATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WITH THAT WILL TRANSITION TO OUR SECOND- A PANEL ON THE GROUND RESPONSES IN THE COVE IT NINETEEN ERA. AND WE HAVE WITH THIS DELORES DAVISON PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ROBERT ORDERS WHICH CHAIR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM WIDE ACADEMIC SENATE. IT IDLE CHAVEZ PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHRISTIAN MALHOTRA VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND STEVE DORSEY THE THIRD PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION FOR LAST YEAR UNIVERSITY. AND WE'LL WE'LL CLEAN UP HERE BEFORE YOU COME UP- I KNOW. ROBERT COURSE WHICH WILL BE PRESENTED VIA WEBEX. AND. MAYBE WE COULD BE A. ROBERT IF YOU'RE THERE. YOU COULD PRESENT FIRST IF YOU'RE THERE. I AM SURE IT DID NOT GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. THE DAMAGE UP INTO THE ACTIVITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO BE SURE YEP FACULTY DIVISION ON A DIME FROM IN PERSON TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION. RESEARCH SUFFERED FOR MANY BECAUSE OF THAT TIP IT AND BECAUSE MANY FACULTY COULD NOT ACCESS LABS WERE PERFORMING SPACES OR FIELD SITES OR ARCHIVES. KEEPING THE UNIVERSITY FUNCTIONING UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF THE PANDEMIC REQUIRED VAST AMOUNTS OF EXTRA WORK ON THE PART OF MANY FACULTY AND MOST ADMINISTRATORS. LAST SPRING YOU SEE SENATE LEADERSHIP CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF THE FACULTY EXPERIENCED UNDER COLD. IN THIS SURVEY WE HEARD FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF UC FACULTY ACROSS OUR TEN CAMPUS LET ME IN VERY SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS THE SURVEY. ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR. THE INSTRUCTORS WHO PARTICIPATED 81% REPORTED HAVING NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH. INSTRUCTION SO THE SHIFT TO REMOTE REQUIRED A MAJOR MAJOR EFFORT IN MOST RESPECTS THAT EFFORT PAID OFF THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC STUDENT ENROLLMENT STEADY AND STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR COURSES FANS AND THEIR PROGRAMS OF STUDY. OF COURSE THE OVERHEAD COSTS LET ME FIRST SPEAK TO THE FACT THE SIDE OF EXPERIENCE. 75% OF FACULTY RECORDED A HIGHER WORKLOAD BECAUSE OF THE SHIFT TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF PREPARING% COURSES IN THAT MODALITY. BAKALY RECEIVED HELP FROM CAMPUS TEACHING AND LEARNING UNITS BUT PERHAPS EVEN MORE FROM THEIR FACULTY COLLEAGUES. OBLIGATIONS AFFECTED THEIR TEACHING AND THAT WAS PRIMARILY PRAYER TICKING RESPONSIBILITIES WHICH FALLS SOMEWHAT MORE ON WOMEN AND MEN. 36% OF FACULTY REPORTED THAT THE RESEARCH SUFFERED GREATLY ANOTHER 42% RESTORED BOB THERE RESEARCH SUFFERED SOMEWHAT. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT RESEARCH WITH SOMEWHAT GREATER FOR WOMEN ON ACTIVE DUTY AND FOR FACULTY IN THE JUNIOR RANKS WHICH FAR MORE DIVERSE. 80% OF FACULTY REPORTED BEING MORE FLEXIBLE AND ACCOMMODATING TOWARD STUDENTS INCLUDING ATTENDING TO STUDENT MENTAL DISTRESS. A SURVEY ON INCLUDED A FEW OPEN SECTIONS WHERE PEOPLE CAN WRITE COMMENTS HERE FACULTY UNLOADED. HERE'S A PARTICULARLY POIGNANT BUT NOT UNUSUAL CONFESSION QUOTE. I'VE HAD LITTLE TIME LITTLE TO NO TIME TO RESEARCH SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY I AM MANAGING A CHILD'S REMOTE EDUCATION HOUSEHOLD MAINTENANCE MY FAMILY'S EMOTIONAL STATUS MY STUDENTS EMOTIONAL STATUS MY COLLEAGUES IN MOTION STATUS. MY DEPARTMENT IS IN POLITICAL SOCIAL CRISIS I AM BUILDING A NEW REMOTE COURSES ON THE FLY MY SERVICE OBLIGATIONS HAVE HUGELY INCREASED AND I AM EXHAUSTED EXHAUSTED IN CAPS I WANT TO QUIT END QUOTE. THE UNIVERSITY CONVENE THE SENATE ADMINISTRATION WORK GROUP ON MILLION GETTING THE IMPACTS OF COVERT ON FACULTY CAREERS. ELIMINATOR A REPORT TO THE CAMPUSES THIS FALL I CO CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE WE RECOMMENDED A RETHINKING OF THE CRITERIA FOR FACULTY MEREDITH PROMOTION. WE PROPOSED TO RE HELP RESTART RESEARCH WITH FUNDS AND PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS FACULTY STRESS. NOW TO THE STUDENTS CITED THE EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW THAT THESE ARE FACULTY IMPRESSIONS OF THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. IN THIS SURVEY 58% OF FACULTY RATED GRADUATE STUDENT ATTENDANCE COURSES OFFERED SYNCHRONOUSLY S. EXCELLENT AND VERY GOOD IN CONTRAST 35% RATED UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT ATTENDANCE AS EXCELLENT AND VERY GOOD. FRANKLY REPORTED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF STUDENTS IN MEDIUM SIZED AND LARGER UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES WERE PRESENT BECAUSE MANY STUDENTS KEPT THEIR CAMERAS OFF THROUGH THE ENTIRE CLASS SESSIONS. MANY FACULTY WROTE THAT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SEEMED LESS ENGAGED WITH CLASS MATERIALS AND THEY ARE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. STUDENT ENGAGEMENT OR PRECISELY THE LACK THEREOF WAS PERHAPS THE SINGLE MOST MENTIONED OBSERVATION AND THE SURVEY QUESTIONS ABOUT INSTRUCTION. IT'S ONE INSTRUCTOR WROTE QUOTE. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT IN CLASS HAS OVERALL DRAMATICALLY DECREASED IN JUST ONE YEAR IT BECAME A HABIT TO NEVER JOIN A CLASS WITH A CAMERA ON AND TO REALLY ALMOST NEVER ASK QUESTIONS IN CLASS AND QUOTE. ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE OUTCOME OF THE SITUATION IS THAT. THOSE THINGS VERY WELL. MANY FACULTY COMMENTED THAT THEY FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO WRITE THE TYPE OF. DETAILED HIGH QUALITY LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION IT HELPS STUDENTS OBTAINING COMPETITIVE POSITIONS INTERNSHIPS AND OFFER FOR GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL. THE SURVEY RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REMOTE INSTRUCTION AT LEAST UNDER PANDEMIC CONDITIONS WHAT'S LESS EFFECTIVE THAN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. 42% OF FACULTY INDICATED THEY BELIEVED THAT STUDENTS HAVE LESS UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURSE MATERIAL. 31% BELIEVE STUDENTS HAD MORE ACADEMIC DIFFICULTY IN REMOTE INSTRUCTION COMPARED TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THE SURVEY ALSO TRIED TO GET IN ANOTHER DEFEAT THE MENTION OF THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT ACADEMIC DISHONESTY AMONG STUDENTS WE ASK THIS BECAUSE THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN AMONG COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS ACROSS THE NATION ABOUT ACADEMIC INTEGRITY. GRADUATES SEEMINGLY IN EVER LARGER NUMBERS ARE USING EXTERNAL STUDENT TUTORING WEBSITES TO GET ANSWERS TO HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AND TEST QUESTIONS. THIS CONCERN INTENSIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE ALL HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS AND TESTS AND PAPERS AND STUFF WE'RE DONE REMOTELY. 54% OF FACULTY. REPORTED THAT THEY PERCEIVED ACADEMIC DISHONESTY TO BE HIGHER OR MUCH HIGHER DURING THAT STRETCH. BOB LET ME NOT CONVEY AN IMPRESSION OF BLAMING STUDENTS THE PANDEMIC AND LOCKED THEM OR HARD ON EVERYONE AND MOST POIGNANT ASPECT OF FACTLY RESPONSES WAS THEIR SENSE OF STUDENTS EXPRESSED ABOUT HARDSHIP. STUDENTS EXPRESS THEIR PROFESSORS WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS FOR COURSE RELATED DIFFICULTIES TO OVERWHELMING PERSONAL CHALLENGES INCLUDING HIGH RATES OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISTRESS. IN MANY OF THE OPEN ENDED COMMENTS ON THE SURVEY IT WAS CLEAR HOW DIFFICULT THE SITUATION WAS FOR EVERYONE. AS ONE PROFESSOR WROTE QUOTE. EVERYTHING WAS TERRIBLE FOR MY STUDENTS. IT WAS AWFUL OPENING MY EMAILS AND QUOTE. NOTWITHSTANDING IT IS IMPORTANT TO CELEBRATE THAT THE UNIVERSITY DID ITS JOB FACTORYTALK COURSES STUDENT. CHRIS WORK PASSED AND MOVED TO HAD DEGREES WERE CONFERRED. THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION OUT THERE THAT NOT MUCH WAS LEARNED AT UNIVERSITY DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S TOO EARLY TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION. OR WHETHER LEARNING LOSS IT'S BEING CALLED WAS DIFFERENT ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STUDENTS AND WHAT THE LONG RANGE EFFECTS. WILL BE THAT SAD. THE CONCEPT OF LEARNING WERE ALL LOST HAS ALREADY ENTERED THE LEXICON AND WILL BE TALKED ABOUT EVEN WITHOUT REAL DATA I THINK WE NEED THE DATA. TO THAT END WE SHOULD LOOK CLOSELY AT HOW THE NEXT YEAR UNFOLDS AND WHAT MIGHT BE KEY INDICES TO TRACK WE MIGHT EXAMINE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER CONCEPTS COVERED IN A PRELIMINARY COURSE ARE INTEGRATED AND USED BY STUDENTS AS THEY MOVE INTO THE NEXT COURSE IN THE SEQUENCE. MY OWN SENSE OF THE WAY TO RECOVER WITH EQUITY IS TO GET STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND STAFF BACK TO CAMPUS. BACK TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION BACKED INTO OUR LIVING BACK TO THE INTERNET PRESS. FOUND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT FUEL LEARNING AND PERSONAL GROWTH. WITHOUT HICCUPS OF CAMPUS RE OPENING THIS FALL THAT ENERGY AND JOY AS CHAIR MEDINA HAS TALKED ABOUT THE ENERGY ENJOY OF EVERYONE ON THE CAMPUS IS PALPABLE AND LEARNING. FOUND DEEP LEARNING IS HAPPENING. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU AND NOW IF WE COULD GO BACK TO DELORES PRESIDENT OF ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES THANK YOU TERMINATE I COULD AFTERNOON SHERMAN YOU KNOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATIVE STAFF. MY NAME IS DORIS DAY OF SOME OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ACADEMIC CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND FOR PROVIDING A LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER- I'M GONNA START WITH TALKING ABOUT THE MITIGATION OF LEARNING LOSS AND THE EQUITY GAPS HAT NEED TO BE CLOSE THAT- AS VICE CHANCELLOR O'BRIEN POINTED OUT WERE NOT CREATED ENTIRELY BY THE PANDEMIC PANDEMIC BUT WE'RE IN FAST. FACT EXACERBATED BY IT SECONDLY I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE TRANSITION TO ONLINE LEARNING- AND WHAT WAS PROVIDED TO FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND I WILL DEFER THE SECTION ABOUT STUDENTS TO- MY COLLEAGUE- DRIVER THERE THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES STUDENT SENATE- I REALLY WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM HIM SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK AS QUICKLY AND AS- LIMITED LISTS ARE LIMITED AS POSSIBLE SO THAT YOU CAN HAIR FROM- A STUDENT ON HE GROUND TO EXPERIENCED ALL OF THIS IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS. I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH ME THE BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES ABOUT RETURNING TO CAMPUS- TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL MATTERS. RATHER THAN WORKPLACE CONDITIONS AND THEN FINALLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RECOVERY WITH EQUITY IN WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR OUR STUDENTS. SO FIRST OF ALL WE OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED- A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WERE ABLE TO TAKE CLASSES FULL TIME- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR AN ACADEMIC SENATE VICE PRESIDENT. IS TO ACTUALLY TEACH A CLASS- NORMALLY WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TEACH OUR SCHEDULES ARE TOO CRAZY BUT- I HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO TEACH ONE ONLINE CLASS IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THING I SHOULD POINT OUT IS THAT I'VE TAUGHT ONLINE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX THIS WAS NOT A DIFFICULT TRANSITION FOR ME- I HAD BEEN DOING THIS FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES TO AND- HALF DECADE. AT THAT POINT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I NOTICED IMMEDIATELY WAS THAT THE MAJORITY OF MY STUDENTS WERE NOT PREPARED FOR THE TRANSITION. MANY OF THEM STRUGGLED WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ISSUES INCLUDING THEIR OWN. LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. THEIR INABILITY TO ACCESS MATERIALS. THEIR LACK OF TECHNOLOGY- AND QUITE FRANKLY IT MADE ME MORE COMPASSIONATE. IT'S MADE ME A BETTER TEACHER. WITH WHAT I WENT THROUGH- DURING THAT SPRING TWENTY TWENTY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD SAY CLEARLY ABOUT THE EQUITY GAPS AND THE NEED TO MITIGATE THE LEARNING LOSS IS THAT WE NEED MORE DATA- WE NEED TO SHARE STUDENT SURVEY DATA. THE STUDENT SENATE DID A TOWN HALL IN A SERIES OF SURVEYS IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE. WE NEED THAT TO BE EXPANDED- AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE WE COVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COLLEGES. IN ALL BUT ONE COUNTY OF THE STATE. WE DO NOT HEAR FROM SOME OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PARTICIPATE OR THEY'RE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE. AND SO A BROADER RANGE OF SURVEY DATA AND MORE INFORMATION FROM STUDENTS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. WE ALSO NEED SOME DISAGGREGATED DATA THERE'S A TENDENCY TO LUMP A LOT OF GROUPS TOGETHER OUR API FACULTY OR STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE ALL LUMPED INTO ONE CATEGORY. WE NEED TO DISAGGREGATE THAT INFORMATION- ALL OF THIS WILL HELP TO IDENTIFY COLLEGES DISTRICTS AND EVEN INDIVIDUAL FACULTY THAT ARE DOING GOOD WORK AND ENABLE US TO SHARE THOSE PRACTICES. ESPECIALLY WORK AROUND ENGAGING STUDENTS MAKING CAMPUS MORE WELCOMING WHETHER IT'S IN PERSON OR ONLINE. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FACULTY ON HOW TO ENGAGE STUDENTS BEST PRACTICES FOR DOING SO AND PEDAGOGICAL SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO TEACH ONLINE. ALL OF THESE THINGS OF COURSE REQUIRE FUNDING AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT. THE TRANSITION ONLINE WAS NOT EASY IN SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY I AM FROM DISTRICT WHICH PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS ONLINE CLASSES AND YET WE STRUGGLED- AND SO I CAN'T IMAGINE CAMPUSES ARE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE VIRTUALLY NO ONLINE PREVIOUSLY. I WORKED CLOSELY WITH NURSING FACULTY- WHICH IS QUITE AN EXCEPTIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT SINCE I AM MYSELF A HISTORIAN AND TEACH WOMEN'S STUDIES- BUT I WORKED WITH THE NURSING FACULTY TO WORK ON. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WEBINARS AND WAYS THAT THEY CAN USE SIMULATION IN THEIR CLASSES I LEARNED A LOT INCLUDING THAT I'M NEVER GOING TO BE AN ALLIED HEALTH FACULTY MEMBER. BECAUSE I WAS TERRIFIED THAT THE FAKE BABY WAS GOING TO DIE AND I ALMOST BURST INTO TEARS DURING ONE OF THE SIMULATIONS. NOT A GOOD PLAYER. HOWEVER ONE OF THE THINGS WE NOTICED WAS THAT THIS WAS NOT A SYSTEMIC OR A WIDESPREAD USE OF TOOLS. WE SAW SOME CAMPUSES PROVIDE THEIR ALL THEIR FACULTY WITH WIFI HOTSPOTS WITH COMPUTERS WITH. ALL KINDS OF THINGS OTHER CAMPUSES DID NOT. WE PARTICULARLY SOUGHT IN OUR ADJUNCT AND PART TIME FACULTY WHO STRUGGLED MANY OF WHOM HAVE LOST CLASSES. C. AND REDUCED THE SCENE REDUCED INCOMES. AND ARE STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR STATUS ON OUR CAMPUSES- DEPENDING ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS OR DISTRICT IN SOME CASES ADDITIONAL FACULTY AND STAFF WERE HIRED TO HELP FACULTY TRANSITION. THERE WERE STIPENDS PROVIDED AT SOME DISTRICTS. SUPPORT SERVICES WERE ALSO SET UP. BUT SYSTEMICALLY THE MAJOR SOURCE OF HELP CAME FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WITH THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PURCHASED WITH THEIR PURCHASING POWER. TO ENABLE CLASSES TO TRANSLATE THE SPECIALLY LAB CLASSES INTO AN ONLINE FORMAT- THEY ALSO ASSISTED WITH CHANGES IN GRADING POLICIES. ARE EXTENDING THE PERIOD DURING WHICH PASS NO PASS COULD BE USED EXTENDING THE PERIOD DURING WHICH EXCUSED WITHDRAWAL COULD BE USED. AND THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE STRUGGLED OR WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR CLASSES. OR DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE THE CLASS BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO RISK A VERY LOW GRADE- AND SO THEY TO PASS NO PASS INSTEAD- IN ADDITION ABOUT MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE AND I WILL SAY IT DID MAKE ME MORE COMPASSIONATE I THINK I'M MUCH NICER NOW WHICH- I GUESS IS A GOOD THING- I WAS MORE FLEXIBLE WITH ASSESSMENTS I WAS MORE FLEXIBLE WITH DUE DATES. MY COLLEGE HAPPENS TO BE ON QUARTERS SO. THEY'RE SUPER FAST ANYWAY AND SO WHEN YOU THROW IN A GLOBAL PANDEMIC- WE WERE FORTUNATE WE WERE FINISHING OUR WINTER QUARTER WHEN THE PANDEMIC IN THE SHUTDOWN STARTED. AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE AN EXTRA WEEK OF SPRING BREAK TO PREPARING FOR EVERYONE AND TO GET. ACCLIMATED TO THE NEW ENVIRONMENT- BUT I WILL SAY THAT I HAD STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY STARTED REACHING OUT TO ME AND I STARTED DOING A LOT OF. ONLINE INVOLVEMENT WITH ZOOM AND TALKING TO STUDENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE OKAY AND- HEARING THEIR STORIES AND- ONE OF MY STUDENTS REACH OUT TO ME AFTER ABOUT THE THIRD WEEK AND SAID I'M A MINUTE A MINUTE COMPROMISED. I AM LIKELY GOING TO HAVE TO DROP YOUR CLASS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HAVE TO. NOT HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH ANYTHING. ANYTHING AND SHE WAS BRILLIANT SHE WAS THE BEST IN THE CLASS AT THAT POINT. I BEGGED HER TO STAY SHE SAID NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL I CAN'T DO THIS I'M SORRY AND SHE CAME BACK ABOUT TEN DAYS LATER AND SAID. HEY THEY LET ME OUT OF THE HOSPITAL I'M IN THE SAFE ENVIRONMENT. CAN I JOIN YOUR CLASS AGAIN AND I SAID THE ABSOLUTELY YOU WERE DOING A GREAT JOB I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS AT ALL. SHE GOT THE HIGHEST GRADE IN THE CLASS SHE'S GOING TO STANFORD. SO THOSE KINDS OF SUCCESSES ARE WHAT KEEP US GOING- MY COLLEAGUE ROBERT. A REFERENCE TO THE EXHAUSTION WE'RE ALL EXHAUSTED. EVERY FACULTY MEMBER I SPEAK TO IS EXHAUSTED. WE'RE ABSOLUTELY TIRED. MORE INITIATIVES NOT THE WAY TO GO AT THIS POINT. LET US JUST. PLEASE TRY TO GET THROUGH ALL THIS- BUT THERE ARE SOME BARRIERS FOR US GOING BACK CAMPUS. UP ALL I BELIEVE OF OUR SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS HAVE CLASSES BACK ON CAMPUS AT THIS POINT- AS DAVID O'BRIEN POINTED OUT WE NEVER CLOSED- WE NEVER SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY. OTHER WERE SOME CAMPUSES WERE FACULTY WERE BACK ON CAMPUS WITHIN WEEKS OF THE INITIAL SHUTDOWN TEACHING OUR CTE COURSES. OUR FIRST RESPONDER COURSES AND THE LIKE- BUT THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES A LOT OF THEM AROUND WORKING CONDITIONS- AROUND MASK MANDATES AROUND EXCEED MANDATES- BUT- THERE ARE ALSO ISSUES AROUND THINGS LIKE. MATERIALS ON CAMPUS- IT'S DIFFICULT TO TEACH SOME CLASSES ONLINE THEY NEED TO BE TAUGHT IN PERSON DO WE HAVE ENOUGH PP FOR THE FACULTY TO TEACH- DO WE HAVE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE- I REALLY APPRECIATED THE QUESTION ABOUT DISABLED STUDENTS- DORADO AND I ARE ON THE STUDENTS HUNDRED LISTENING TOUR WHICH IS TRAVELING TO SEVEN COLLEGES THIS QUARTER. SORRY THIS TERM CAN'T HELP BUT- AND LISTENING TO STUDENTS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT OUR LAST TOUR WE HAD A- A MOTHER OF A STUDENT WHO IS DISABLED TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH HAD BEEN CLOSE TO THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC IT WAS HEARTBREAKING- AS SOMEONE WHO IS ENGAGED TO A MAN WHO HAS MOBILITY ISSUES WALKING AROUND A COUPLE OF THE CAMPUSES HAS BEEN. A CLEAR INDICATOR THAT THEY ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR OUR STUDENTS AND CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER ISSUES HAVE MADE THEM EVEN MORE DIFFICULT- FINALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RECOVERY WITH THE EQUITY. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WE CAN'T PLACE BLAME ON ANY ONE GROUP OR ANYONE SET OF PEOPLE FOR WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THERE ARE SO MANY VARIABLES AND CIRCUMSTANCES TO CONSIDER. THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND- THE NEEDS THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND STAFF. ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE MAY BE AN INCREASE OF EQUITY GAPS- ALONG WITH DIVERSITY CUT DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS ARE SYSTEM COMES THE NEED. FOR A DIVERSITY IN SOLUTIONS TO NAVIGATE LEARNING AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WE ALSO REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH POST PANDEMIC I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ABOUT THAT- OUR FACULTY AND STAFF NEED THAT ESPECIALLY OUR ADJUNCT FACULTY- WHO IN MANY CASES AS I SAID BEFORE STRUGGLING. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S BECOME MORE CLEAR THAT SOLUTIONS AROUND THIS NEED TO COME. FROM THOSE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE STUDENTS THAT IS THE PRACTITIONERS ON THE CAMPUSES. OF FACULTY STAFF ADMINISTRATORS AND THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES- THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED FOR MORE COUNSELLING SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS THERE'S CLEARLY A NEED FOR OTHER PIECES THE DORADO AND I BOTH HEARD ABOUT- ALLOWING STUDENTS TO STAY ON THEIR PATH AND TRANSFERRING TO A FOUR YEAR SYSTEM. GETTING A JOB SKILLS BUILDING WHATEVER THEIR ECONET- THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS ARE. BUT GETTING STUDENTS IN AND OUT AS IMPORT WHILE SOME GETTING STUDENTS AND I WAS IMPORTANT. FINDING OUT THEIR NEEDS AND PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO MEET THOSE NEEDS IS THE ABSOLUTE DEFINITION OF A STUDENT CENTERED SYSTEM AND ONE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DOORS AND NOW WE WILL GO ON TO THAT ARE LOW TRAVIS PRESIDENT STUDENT CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I DID. LOSE MY MIND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE- MY NAME MR ARDAL CHAVEZ I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE STUDENT SENATE IS UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT WE REPRESENT ONE OF THE LARGEST POPULATION. OF STUDENTS IN THE NATION. OVER TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO GAUGE STUDENT INPUT- WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A VAST DIVERSE. POPULATION BUT- THANK GOODNESS THAT WE ARE TAUGHT TO ME IN OUR STATE IS RE OPENING- BECAUSE WE ARE VISITING OUR STUDENTS. WERE COMING TO THEM. ARE WE ARE LEADING THE SYSTEM BY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE CALLING TO THE STUDENTS AND THE STUDENTS ARE NOT COMING TO US- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS IS THE IMPACT. OF THE PANDEMIC TO OUR STUDENTS. ARE FAR BEYOND SOCIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS ABOUT FOCUS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS SENATE CONDUCTED A SURVEY THAT COLLECTED THE STORIES OF FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND A COMMON THING THAT WE SEE IS- THE EXHAUSTION OF THE MENTAL EXHAUSTION IN THE EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE IN DURING. IN THAT LEADS TO. LEARNING LOSS ARE THAT THAT LEADS INTO OUR DECLINE ENROLLMENT BECAUSE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS FEEL- HOPELESS. I HAVE TO SAY THE LEAST THEY FEEL HOPELESS BY CONTINUING. THIS IS EDUCATION- IN THERE'S NO. CONSENSUS ON DISTANCE EDUCATION BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE HAVE A- DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS. AND ONLINE EDUCATION HAS BEEN HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS. ALTHOUGH FOR SOME POPULATIONS IT HAS BEEN IT HAS BECOME A BURDEN AND HAS BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO THEIR SUCCESS. IN WITHIN THOSE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX- STORIES THAT WE SAW. THERE'S ONE STORY THAT- REALLY HIGHLIGHTS HOW FAR CAN DEPEND THAT MAY GO TO AFFECT OUR STUDENTS. THERE WAS A STORY THAT A STUDENT- SHE'S MARRIED- IN DURING THE PANDEMIC. I SEE HAD ANNOUNCED SAFE ENVIRONMENT AT HOME- SHE EXPERIENCED ABUSE. PHYSICAL. ABUSE FROM HER SPOUSE- IS SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NO ONE TO TURN TO SO SHE BECAME HOMELESS. THIS JUST PROVES THAT ARE COLLEGES ARE MORE THAN- OF THE CITIZENS OF LEARNING. I COLLEGES HAVE BECOME A SECOND HOME FOR STUDENTS THEY HAVE BECOME IT'S THE SPACE FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY GAPS. EQUITY GAPS HAVE BEEN THERE- YOU KNOW SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR INSTITUTION- BUT THE THING THAT WE SEE IN THE PANDEMIC IS- ARE YOU SEPARATE STUDENTS FROM THE CAMPUS AND THAT IS WHERE WE START SEEING THE HOUSING SECURITY THE FOOD AND SECURITY. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ESPECIALLY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BECAUSE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS RELIED ON OUR CAMPUS FOR LIBRARIES ARE WRITING CENTERS THE COMPUTERS ARE ARE AVAILABLE ON CAMPUS. AND WHEN WE WENT HOME BECAUSE CAMPUS CLOSE IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY WE SAW HOW STUDENTS WERE STRUGGLING AND WE SAW HOW STUDENTS DID NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY OR THE BROADBAND IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR EDUCATION. SO WHAT ARE ONE THINGS THAT I SAW IS A LOT OF STUDENTS SIMPLY JUST DROPPED OUT- I LIVE IN THE L. EMPIRE ENSURE YOU MAY KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WAREHOUSES. IN THE L. IMPAIRED- IN UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF MY PEERS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS. ARE DECIDED TO PUT ASIDE THEIR MISSIONS- OF PURSUING EDUCATION. AND WENT TO THE WORK FORCE. ARE THEY DROPPED OUT COMPLETELY AND WENT TO THE WAREHOUSE- AMAZON WAREHOUSES THAT WE HAVE IN THE- EMPIRE- IN THOSE ARE SIMILAR STORIES THAT WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE STATE- MANY OF STUDENTS THAT- ONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS. DIED ONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS. BUY FOOD FOR THEIR HOME FOR THEIR HOUSE ONLY MORE SO THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO PUT AWAY THEIR AMBITION AND ENTER THE WORKFORCE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO SEE WHAT THE PANDEMIC. IS THAT IS THE FINE CLASSISM IN OUR SYSTEM. UNDERLYING CLASSES AND THAT WAS OFTEN IGNORED- COMMITTEE CLOSE IS NO LONGER JUST FOR EIGHTEEN YEAR OLDS AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS. WE SEE THIRTY YEAR OLDS FORTY OR FIFTY YEAR OLD EVEN SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS. AND WE SEE THEIR SYSTEM WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THEM. HOW DO WE SEE THAT- LIKE I SAID WE'VE BEEN VISITING CAMPUSES. AND TO STUDENTS APPROACH ME AND THEIR STUDENT PARENTS AND THEY SAID. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I FACE AS A STUDENT PARENT IS THAT'S HEALTHCARE. ARTS HEALTHCARE HAS BECOME AN IMPEDIMENT TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS- JUST TO BE MORE SPECIFIC GOALS TO STUDENTS THAT CHILD CARE ENDS AT THREE PM. MY CLASSES UNTIL FIVE PM. WHAT DO YOU DO THEN- THEY SAID I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE CLASS EARLY- AND THAT IS HOW WE SEE THE EQUITY GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM AND- HOW CAN WE ADDRESS THAT. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LISTENING TO THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE- WE HELP OVER TWO POINT MILLION STUDENTS AND EACH OF THEM HAS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND THEY'RE ABLE TO TELL YOU. WHAT THE PREVENTIVE COSTS DOWN FOR THEM. WHAT HOW THE HEALTH OF CONDEMNING AFFECTED THEM- BUT WE ALSO WOULD DEPEND THAT MAKE WE HAVE SEEN INCREASE IN ACCESSIBILITY. WE HAVE SEEN THAT ARE FOR ADULT LEARNERS OR STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING TO MY CLASSES. WE HAVE SEEN AN EXPANSION OF OURS FOR COUNSELING- WE HAVE SEEN THAT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND EDUCATION HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE. AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR STUDENTS- THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS WHERE STUDENTS TELL ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RETURN TO CAMPUS BECAUSE OF DISTANCE LEARNING. OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO COLLEGE OR START THE ACADEMIC JOURNEY. SO THAT'S A POSITIVE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE SEEN. BUT REGARDLESS OF THE NEGATIVE ALWAYS THE POSITIVE UNFORTUNATELY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO- ADDRESS- SPECIALLY WITH- WHAT WAS STUDENTS WHO ARE TRANSFERRING- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID SEE AND OUR SURVEY. IS THAT STUDENTS HOW TO DELAY. THE TRANSFER PROCESS I PERSONALLY HAVE TO DELAYED MY TRANSFER- BECAUSE OF THE- UNCERTAINTY WHETHER IN OTHER THAT UNIVERSITY THAT I WAS APPLYING WAS GOING TO RE OPEN. IN MANY OF OUR STUDENTS DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO. WASTE MONEY- SO WHY GO TO A FOUR YEAR- WHEN I'M GOING TO WIN THIS DISTANCE LEARNING WHEN I'M DOING COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF OUR STUDENTS ARE THINKING- BUT OVERALL THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY SATELLITE ON THE EQUITY GAPS. AND THE WAY THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE EQUITY GAPS IS PUTTING STUDENTS UP FRONT. MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AT THE TABLE WHEN DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THAT ARTICLE AND I WILL GO TO CHRISTIAN NOW HOW TRUE VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN DANA AND MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS KRISHAN MALHOTRA I'M CURRENTLY A SENIOR AT STANISLAUS STATE INTERLOCK WHERE I STUDY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION WITH A CONCENTRATION IN MARKETING. I ALSO SERVE AS THE VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. WHICH IS THE OFFICIAL VOICE OF NEARLY HALF A MILLION CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. TODAY I'D LIKE TO SHARE HOW CSU STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE MANAGED TO DEAL WITH THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHILE STILL TRYING TO ACCESS THEIR EDUCATION AND GRADUATE ON TIME. FIRSTLY WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT STUDENTS HAVE FACED ALL OF THE SAME CHALLENGES THAT YOU ALL HAVE FACED HERE. WETHERBY ISOLATION ILLNESS OR LOSS OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS. STUDENTS ALSO HAD MORE OF A UNIQUE CHALLENGE WHERE WE HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH THE TRANSITION TO ONLINE LEARNING. THIS RESULTED IN LEARNING LOSS AND PERPETUATED EQUITY GAPS EVEN MORE THAN WE COULD'VE IMAGINED BEFORE. THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED OTHER PRE EXISTING ISSUES AS WELL LIKE MENTAL HEALTH HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY. NOBODY WAS PREPARED FOR THIS PANDEMIC NOT THE STATE NOT THE CSU AND DEFINITELY NOT OUR STUDENTS. THIS LED TO A HUGE SCRAMBLE IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD TRANSITION TO BEING VIRTUAL. AND IN THE BEGINNING MOST OF THE EFFORTS WERE CENTERED AROUND ENSURING STUDENTS COULD ACCESS THEIR CLASSES- WHILE THEY'RE ONLINE AT HOME. CAMPUSES DID THEIR BEST AT THE TIME TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WEATHER WAS PROVIDING HOT SPOTS ARE CREATING PARTNERSHIP WITH BROAD BAND- PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. BUT EVEN WITH THOSE EFFORTS STUDENTS STRUGGLED AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO THIS DAY- WITH HAVING A STABLE AND RELIABLE CONNECTION FOR THEIR CLASSES. FOR THOSE WITHOUT A LAPTOP CAMPUSES ALSO PROVIDED LONERS- AND YOU KNOW THIS WAS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF CAMPUSES- THE ABOUT A LAPTOP THAT CAMPUS HAD- UNFORTUNATELY LIKE YOU HEARD EARLIER WITH NEW PROGRAMS LIKE C. SUCCESS. FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH A TABLET AND KEYBOARD AND APPLE. PENCIL AND SO STRIDES ARE BEING MADE TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM AND WE'RE HOPING FOR MORE FUNDING. AND IT CAN HELP US MOVE CLOSE EQUITY GAPS MOVING FORWARD. AS YOU ALL KNOW ALSO SITUATIONS VARY GREATLY FROM CAMPUS TO CAMPUS AND BUT GENERALLY THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF FEELING. OF SUPPORT AND EMPATHY TO THE STRUGGLES THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE FACED IN THE LAST TWENTY ONE MONTHS. ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE THAT VIRTUAL LEARNING AND ONLINE COURSES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THEY WOULD BE IN PERSON. AND THAT'S THE FURTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH. VIRTUAL LEARNING IS EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AND EVEN TO THIS DAY OUR STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH BURNOUT ENGINE FATIGUE. THERE ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGES AS WE ALL KNOW VERY FIRST HAND BUT I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE POSITIVE AS WELL. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE ACADEMIC ADVISING IN MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING HAD MOVED TO AN ONLINE AND NOW A HYBRID MODEL SO STUDENTS COULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THIS SHIFT MORE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO USE THE SERVICES WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVEL TO CAMPUS. WHICH IS GREAT AND MAKES IT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR US ALL. STUDENTS ARE ALSO HAPPY TO SEE THE CSU TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE ACT AND SAT AS EMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS TO ITS UNIVERSITIES. AND HOPE THIS BECOMES A PERMANENT- HOPE THIS BECOMES PERMANENT AYE STANDARDIZED TESTING POSES DOWNSIDE OF EQUITY CONCERNS. ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT STUDENTS OF LIGHT IS THE FLEXIBILITY OF ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE COURSES. THESE COURSES ALLOW FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN ON THEIR OWN AT THEIR OWN PACE- WHILE BALANCING THEIR OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES. AND STUDENTS HAVE VOICED THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS MODEL BECAUSE IT MAKES A DEGREE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. JUST BECAUSE THE TIMING AVAILABILITY. NOW AS WE CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE RETURNING TO CAMPUS STUDENTS ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE A WORLD THE VACCINE REQUIREMENTS MASKS AND THEIR OWN HEALTH CONCERNS. WELL THE CSU DOES HAVE A VACCINE MATTER- REQUIREMENT TO LOWER THE RISK OF IN NINETEEN TRANSITION- TRANSMISSION SORRY SAFETY IS STILL A BIG CONCERN FOR MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. STUDENTS ARE FILLED STILL FEELING THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND I STRUGGLING TO NAVIGATE RETURNING TO CAMPUS WHILE FINDING CHILD CARE. TAKING CARE OF SICK FAMILY MEMBERS AND A HUGE VARIANCE IN GUIDELINES FROM CITY TO CITY THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS PARKING AND ALREADY INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE SERVICE HAS HINDERED STUDENTS ABILITY TO RETURN TO CAMPUS. SO FAR ANSWER IS GOING BACK TO CAMPUS WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK. THE PANDEMIC ALSO RESULTED IN JOB LOSS FOR COUNTLESS STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHICH ONLY EXACERBATED. PRE EXISTING FINANCIAL STRUGGLES AND HINDER THE STUDENTS ABILITY TO FOR THEIR DEGREE. MOVING FORWARD INCREASES AND REFORMS OF FINANCIAL AID ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING STUDENTS CAN STILL GRADUATE- AND THE EQUITY GAPS ARE ELIMINATED. EMILY AND I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. SUPPORT FOR BASIC NEEDS IS ALSO A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF RECOVERY AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO INVEST IN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY HOMELESSNESS AND THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. INTERNET ACCESS AND TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN FUTURE COURSES. REGARDLESS OF WHAT MENTALITY THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT IN. STUDENTS WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO SEE CHOICES AND HOW AND WHERE THEY CAN ATTEND CLASSES OR RECEIVE SERVICES. HAVING OPTIONS- FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND EITHER IN PERSON OR ONLINE ALLOWS A STUDENT TO HAVE THE CHOICE TO DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR LEARNING STYLE WHILE ALSO CONSIDERING THEIR OTHER OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. IN CONCLUSION OUR STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN OUR STUDENTS AND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS EXIST IN ORDER TO BETTER THE LIVES OF STUDENTS. RIGHT NOW WE'RE STRUGGLING. THIS STATE OUR INSTITUTIONS MUST WORK TOGETHER TO MITIGATE THE HORRIBLE IMPACT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU CHRISTIAN. NEXT WE'LL GO TO STEVE DORSEY THE THIRD PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT ASSOCIATION OF LOS HERE UNIVERSITY. ALL RIGHTS TO EXPRESS THE HELLO THERE YOU GO. ODD TO THE DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS LAWRENCE STEPHEN DORSEY THE THIRD A GRADUATING SENIOR AND STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT FROM LAST YEAR UNIVERSITY- FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE SIMPLY OF HIGHER EDUCATION MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DISCUSSION ON BEHALF OF LAST YEAR UNIVERSITY- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY I DO NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED. ANIMAL HONORED THAT. I THINK THAT WE AS STUDENT BODY PRESIDENTS CAN AGREE THAT THIS IS ADVOCACY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL- FOR THE STUDENTS WE'VE BEEN TASKED REPRESENTS- ALL HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND IN OUR SECTOR TO BE EXACT. THIS IS WHAT PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE. I WANT CONSTRUCTING MY TESTIMONY- THERE ARE MANY SUBJECTS I WANTED TO SHED LIGHT ON. A YET IN ORDER TO DO SO I HAD TO BE HONEST WITH MYSELF. AND WE NEED TO BE HONEST WITH OURSELVES. I WHEN WE ALLOCATE THE BLAME OF LEARNING LOSS AND EQUITY CHASMS AND HIGHER EDUCATION HOLY. TO THE PANDEMIC. WE AS INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUALS HIDE OUR GAZE FROM THE STARK REALITY WE MUST ADMIT TO OURSELVES. THE PANDEMIC ONLY HIGHLIGHTED AND EXAGGERATED ALREADY VISCERAL DISPARITIES PRESENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION. FIVE FOR BEING TRULY HONEST WITH OURSELVES EVERY UNIVERSITY PRESENT HERE TODAY KNOWS WE HAVE A FRAGMENT OF BLAME TO SHARE FOR THIS FACT. KOPEN NINETEEN BECAUSE THIS ALL ITS INSTITUTIONS TO IMPARTIALLY LOOK AT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND ASK ARE WE GIVING EVERYONE A FAIR CHANCE- THIS IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION TO PONDER WHICH MAKES IT ALL THE MORE IMPERATIVE- TO CULTIVATE EDUCATION SYSTEMS OF TRUE EQUITY. THE CHALLENGE OF LEARNING DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS HAVING THE PRESENCE OF MIND TO LEARN- MISS SOCIAL UPHEAVAL AND TAKING ON ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. I STUDENTS WE WERE ATTENDING CLASSES WITH UNEXPLAINABLE AMOUNTS OF COGNITIVE SHRAPNEL CAUSED BY SOCIETY AND NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS TO ONLINE LEARNING- WHILE WE HAD TO ADJUST OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FAILED AT TIMES TO JUST WITH US. SOME STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO THRIVE DURING THE ONLINE ERROR OF SCHOOLING- MAINTAIN A STEADY SCHEDULE EVEN INCREASE THEIR GPA. HOWEVER FAR TOO MANY STUDENTS SPOKE OF WORKING FORTY HOUR WEEKS. BABYSITTING AND LONG ON TO ZOOM ONLY FOR THE COURSE MATERIAL TO GO OVER THEIR HEADS. NOW BY NO MEANS IN MY SIGNING THE BLAME- TO ADMINISTRATORS OR PROFESSORS FOR THIS CAUSALITY I NEVER THE LESS I BIGGEST ALL TO LOOK COMPREHENSIVELY AT THAT JARRING CONTRAST- ANECDOTES ASIDE ASIDE DATA WOULD SUGGEST THAT STUDENTS LOGGING FORTY HOUR WEEKS AND- IN ADDITION TO EIGHTEEN CREDIT. CLASSES WERE PRIMARILY PERSONS OF COLOR. I'M MORE ALREADY KNEE DEEP IN STUDENT LOANS. STUDENTS WHO MADE THEIR WAY INTO HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS- BY SHEER FORCE OF WILL ONLY FOR THE RUG TO BE PULLED UP ANYTHING. THE MOST TROUBLING ASPECT OF THIS PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT EVEN BEFORE COVER NINETEEN THE STUDENTS HAD THEIR BACKS TO THE WALL FINANCIALLY. OF THE PANDEMIC FORCE THESE DARK SHOES INTO THE OPEN. HOWEVER THERE STOOD A BRILLIANT FEW- WHO ACTED AS A LIGHT BEARS IN THIS DARKNESS THOSE WHO WISH TO SEE STUDENTS SUCCEED REGARDLESS OF SOCIETAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. PROFESSORS FACULTY AND STAFF WHO STOOD IN THE GAP FOR STUDENTS WHEN THEY COULD NOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. AT TIMES NUMEROUS PROFESSORS SHIFTED THEIR ENTIRE LESSON PLANS AND LEARNING OUTCOMES TO FACILITATE A LEARNING EXPERIENCE- CONDUCIVE TO STUDENT SUCCESS. WEATHER WAS INCORPORATING- EXPERIENCE- WHETHER IT WAS INCORPORATING MORE ASYNCHRONOUS CLASSES GIVING STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO GO AHEAD OR EXTENDING GRACE TO STUDENTS WITH LIFE ALTERING- CIRCUMSTANCES ON A PERSONAL LEVEL. THESE INDIVIDUALS GAVE HOPE WHEN IT WAS IN LOW SUPPLY. ON A UNIVERSITY LEVEL I CAN SPEAK PERSONALLY TO- LAST YEAR AS WELLNESS DEPARTMENT REMOVING THE LIMIT OF COUNSELING SESSIONS ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS AND TRANSITIONING THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT ONLINE IN ORDER TO MEET THE READILY APPARENT NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. DECISIONS LIKE BEES MADE THE TRANSITION TO ONLINE LEARNING EASIER WHEN EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD SUGGESTED DESPAIR WAS THE ONLY AVAILABLE OPTION. MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS MATTER IS ONE I'LL CARRY WITH ME TO ALL MY FUTURE ENDEAVORS- BECAUSE BEFORE THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC I SERVED AS A RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANT IN THE DORM. AND DURING THE RISE- DURING THE PANDEMIC I SERVED AS A STUDENT DEAN FOR THE RESIDENCE HALL- AS AN RA I WAS PART OF THE TEAM THAT FACILITATED THE MASSIE TRANSITION IN CLEARING OUT THE DORMS. IN LESS THAN A WEEK- THERE WAS AN INHERENTLY HARROWING NATURE TO TELLING STUDENTS TO PACK THEIR BELONGINGS. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO CONFIDENTLY TELL THEM WHEN THEY BE BACK- I REMEMBER CONSOLING INTERNATIONAL RESIDENTS WHO WERE UNSURE WHEN THEY WOULD SEE THEIR FAMILIES AGAIN- DUE TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS. I REMEMBER REASSURING STUDENTS WITH UNHEALTHY LIVING ENVIRONMENTS AT HOME THAT THEY WOULD PREVAIL. THAT WE WOULD SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN- AS A STUDENT IN YOUR ONE OF THE PANDEMIC I RECALL COUNTLESS PEERS TELLING ME THEY CAN'T AFFORD COLLEGE ANYMORE DUE TO THEM HAVING TO PICK UP MORE WORK SINCE THEIR PARENT WAS LAID OFF. ALL THIS BEING SAID- MY PERSPECTIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC ALSO GRANTED ME INSIGHT. INTO THE INGENUITY AND RESILIENCE OF THE MODERN STANDARD. I SAW STUDENTS FIND THEIR VOICE APPEARS TO REALIZE THAT THEIR VOICES CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN JOINED TOGETHER. OF THE PANDEMIC SHOWED ME A GLIMPSE OF HOPE FOR WHAT MY GENERATION CAN AND WILL ACCOMPLISH IF WE STAY THE COURSE. THE PANDEMIC SHOWED US ALL THAT WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE RADICALLY INTENTIONAL IN CHANGING SYSTEMS IF. WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO THINK BEYOND CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE. MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY THAT IN ITSELF IS THE IS THE KEY TO CLOSING THE EQUITY GAP IN EDUCATION- ALLOWING OURSELVES TO FATHOM THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGE. I CAN ALWAYS THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK- BUT IT IS A NECESSARY ONE. IF WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE SAME WAY WE WILL YIELD THE SAME EXACT RESULTS. ARE RECOVERY AND RESTORATION WILL REQUIRE RE EXAMINATION AND AUTHENTIC ANALYSIS OF UNIVERSITY POLICY AND WHOM IT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT. SHUTTING THE DOOR TO PANDEMIC INEQUALITY IN EDUCATION WILL REQUIRE MONUMENTAL STEPS LIKE EXTENDING THE PASS OR FAIL OPTION ON GREAT BOOKS OR FOR GOING THE S. A. T. AT ACT FOR INCOMING FRESHMEN- WHICH ARE EXCELLENT STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. RECOVERY WILL REQUIRE TIME. IT WILL DEMAND COMMITMENT BUT MOST OF ALL IT WILL TAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU PRESENT HERE TODAY WILLING TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT- WE OWE IT TO GENERATIONS PAST AND WE MUST BE BETTER FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU LAWRENCE- DR WEBER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. J. DR CHOI QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL. NOT A PARTICULAR QUESTION I APPRECIATE THE FULL COMING UP BUT THE TESTIFIED AND I KNOW ALL COMING UP IS NOT THAT EASY BUT- I ALSO MADE THE TRIP FROM ORANGE COUNTY THIS MORNING I GOTTA CATCH MY PLANE PRETTY SOON. ABOUT THE I DO KNOW THAT A LOT OF- ISSUES- COME UP- ON THE CAMPUS- A PARTICULARLY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- I HAVE TALKED TO MY CELL PHONE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO FOR SEVENTY NEAR SAYS THAT JUMPED FACULTY SO I KNOW IT'S JUGGLING THE- CONTAMINATED EIFFEL BECAUSE MOST OF MOST OF THE STUDENTS SO. THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- FROM MAJORITY MAJORITY OUR ADULT POPULATION AND THEN ALSO ATTENDING THE CLASSES SO BUT THE- I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN THINKING. SOME STILL SOME UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING- ESPECIALLY AFTER HIGHER LEARNING EDUCATION ON ON OUR WAY BEFORE. THIS FUNDAMENTAL. I IN MOST PART IF NOT ELEMENTARY LEVEL LONG ENOUGH- I'M NOT LOADING AND- USED TO THE ONLINE LEARNING. AND THERE IS PRESSURE ON THE PLAN- ONE OF YOU MENTIONED THAT THE ONE NINE LOOTING FOR MYSELF LESS ABILITY AND I DON'T HOLD YOUR OWN PAYS OUT AND TAKING CARE OF ALL. IN ALL HOUSE CHORES AND THEIR CHILDREN AND WHEN YOU HAVE TIME AT THE EVENING TIMES YOU CAN OPEN UP A CAN MONNING STILL NOT WELL ATTENDED TO SAY EVEN THOUGHT THERE ARE SOME. OF THE PROBLEMS. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THE- I'VE BEEN THINKING. IF IN THE FUTURE IF WE CAN- BUT VALUES TO TECHNOLOGY. AND MANY MINUS. THE DIFFICULTIES OF ONLINE LEARNING. AMADOR SAID IMPROVE WHAT THE TECHNOLOGY- FOR ONLINE LEARNING. AND NOT. TOTALLY ELIMINATE THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES DO YOU THINK OF AS A PHYSICAL IDEA. WELL LET THE STUDENT CENTER THAT WOULD BE I THINK THAT'S A GOOD A GREAT POINT VICE CHAIR TO AYE AYE I'M JOHN I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT WOULD WORK FOR ALL OF OUR MAJORS AND PROGRAMS THOUGH- I THINK THE BENEFIT OF ONLINE LEARNING IS THAT IT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY. TO THE PEOPLE WHOSE LEARNING STYLE THAT ONLINE LEARNING- MEETS. HOWEVER THERE ARE CERTAIN STUDENTS WHO HAVE A HARD TIME LEARNING IF THEY'RE NOT IN THE CLASSROOM AND I'VE SEEN ON MY CAMPUS I WALKED AROUND SOME OF THE BUILDINGS AND THERE'S A LIFE SIZE DUMMIES AND DOLLS OF FOR NURSING PROGRAMS THAT. THEY TERRIFY ME BUT THEY NEED THAT PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE- ONCE THEY GO TO THE HOSPITAL OR TO THE FACILITY TO WORK SO. I THINK FOR THE STUDENTS THAT WORKS FOR WE SHOULD LET IT WORK FOR THEM AND FOR THE REST OF US AND THEN FOR THE REST OF THE OTHER STUDENTS THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT SPACE TO RETURN TO CAMPUS WHETHER THAT'S NOW OR- EVENTUALLY. IN ONE EXAMPLE I THOUGHT THE- ONLY ONE OF THE MORE DIFFICULT TO STUDY IS SO- THE- OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THROUGH ONLINE LEARNING WITH THE NURSING BECAUSE A NOURISHING ORDER ORDER HAVE TO SHOW DEMONSTRATE THAT OFF IN A DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY AND THE HOW TO INTERACT WITH THE PATIENTS OR WHATEVER. SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH- MY- OUR DAUGHTER IN ALL. HAS BEEN ENROLLED IN ONE CLASS AT UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA. IN NOURISHING AND THE NEXT MONTH SUCH AS CAN I GET THE DOCTORATE DEGREE IN NURSING- PRACTITIONERS- DISCIPLINE AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CONGRATULATE. AND THAT DOESN'T ACCEPT FOR IF A NURSING CAN BE. ARCHTOP ONLINE HOW COME THEY DON'T REST OF THE- SUBJECTS I'M SURE THAT THE SOMETHING SOMETHING CLASS TO SOME. INVOLVE OUR LAB WORK ETCETERA SO. I THINK THAT THAT CAN SOFTEN MASTABA ISSUES HAS TO ADDRESS US SUBJECT TO I GUESS UP EDUCATIONAL EXPERT EXPLOSIVE TO RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENT EXPERIMENT THE WEATHER THAT WILL PROVIDE THE MORE CONVENIENT SELF ASSURANCE UP TO LEARN. AND IS A STRONGER TO PARKER THEY'LL PAY PARKING FEES AND THE CHILD CARE BY A- ON A FULL IN PERSON RUNNING ON CAMPUS HAS A LOT OF A DRAWBACK TO SO I THINK THAT'S THE ONE AREA I'M THINKING WE CAN WE SHOULD EXPLORE. THAT'S A JUST A COMMENT. IF MAY MATCH IT IF I COULD ADD A DO ALSO BELIEVE IT IS A- INSTANCE OF BOTH AND IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE- EITHER OR BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE WONDERFUL STORIES OF PROGRAMS BEING ABLE TO ADJUST AND STILL BE AFFECTED IN THEIR LEARNING OUTCOMES- HOWEVER THERE ARE. YOU KNOW ON THE FLIP SIDE SO FOR INSTANCE LAST YEAR I WAS DOING MY RESEARCH SEQUENCE FOR MY METHODS AND RESEARCH STATISTICS COURSE. AND IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO A STUDY ONLINE- ONLY BECAUSE YOU MISS OUT ON SO MUCH IN PERSON RECRUITING- HOWEVER. WE WERE ABLE TO PUT THE SURVEY ONLINE AND RECRUIT THROUGH THAT AND WE GOT A DECENT AMOUNT OF PARTICIPANTS SO. I THINK WE SHOULD AND CAN KEEP BOTH SYSTEMS AND THEY CAN STILL BE EFFECTIVE AND WE SHOULD. BUT THAT THAT WOULD BE MY TAKE ON IT THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS AND I HOPE I WILL. HAVE TIME FOR. AB ONE OR TWO- QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. IF THERE'S ANYONE OUT THERE WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS.
