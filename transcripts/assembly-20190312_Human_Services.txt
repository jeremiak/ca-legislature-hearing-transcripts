AS A COURTESY I WILL BE ALLOWING MISTER MAIENSCHEIN TO PRESENT FIRST TODAY. ARE YOU WILL BE PRESENTING OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA AS BILL ITEM NUMBER. THREE AS WELL AS HIS OWN.

OKAY SO I'LL START WITH -- A. B. THREE THIRTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA -- AS A STATE WE PASS LAWS TO ENSURE FOSTER YOUTH HAVE EDUCATION RIGHTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN EDUCATIONAL STABILITY AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES. FOSTER YOUTH HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN AT THE SAME SCHOOL EVEN AFTER THEY ARE MOVED TO A NEW FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. TO HELP FACILITATE THIS PROCESS CARE GIVERS ARE ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO A CHILD'S SCHOOL OF ORIGIN. HOWEVER TRANSPORTATION FUNDING DOES NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE CARE GIVER IS APPROVED THROUGH THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION REIMBURSEMENT. A FOSTER USE LIFE CAN BE FURTHER DISRUPTED THIS IS WHY AB THREE THIRTY SEVEN IS NEEDED WITH ME TODAY IS KRISTIN POWER WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AND JORDAN SO SO WITH THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE UP. GOOD AFTERNOON KRISTIN POWER WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR CHILDREN'S RIGHTS WERE PRACTICAL SPONSOR THIS. MEASURE WITH THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH CONNECTION AB THREE THREE SEVEN ONE HANDS EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE PROMOTE SCHOOL AND PLACE INSTABILITY BY ENSURING THAT CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE TO QUALIFY. FOR EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVE. AND DURING THIS TIME OF THE RESOURCE FAMILIES COMPLETING RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL I WILL PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH THE NOTICE OF THEIR RIGHT TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COSTS TRANSPORTING A YOUTH TO THEIR SCHOOL OF ORIGIN. WE BELIEVE CARE GIVERS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO SCHOOL CHILD SCHOOL WHARTON TIME MAY TAKE PLACE MEANT. TO PROMOTE SCHOOL PLACEMENT STABILITY FOR THE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. TO ILLUSTRATE THE ISSUE. TO PREVENT TO YOUNG PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO CHANGE SCHOOLS ALLIANCE CLIENTS JAKE ANNALISE'S AUNT WHO CARED FOR THEM WHEN THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR PARENTS TO TWO ALLEGED ABUSE. DRIVE THEM FROM CANYON COUNTRY IN NORTH LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO LA YOU UST ABOUT FIFTY MILES ONE WAY. EACH DAY FOR SCHOOL FOR TWO YEARS. AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF AB ALLIANCE ADVOCACY JAKE AND MELISSA'S AUNT WAS REIMBURSED FOR THE TRANSPORTATION SHE HAD PROVIDED TO ALLOW J. CAMILLUS TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITY. CONTINUE TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. AB THREE THREE SEVEN WILL ALLOW THAT FUNDING TO BEGIN FROM THE TIME JAY CAMILLUS THAT WERE PLACED IN WOULD HAVE PROVIDED NOTICE EITHER IN THE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING REIMBURSEMENT. FEDERAL EA TANNA FUNDS COVER THE MAJORITY OF COSTS FOR THIS PROGRAM AND SO IT MAKES SENSE TO AFFORD OUR FOSTER CARE GIVERS AND THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES.

THAT THIS WAS PROVIDING SOME SORT. OF BENEFIT. SO YOU'LL FEEL ORDER RELIEVE -- ANY BURDEN FOR THE OF CURRENT. RECIPIENTS SO FAR I IT'S IT'S IT'S SERVICES THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND THE BILL MISTER.

FOR TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO PER MONTH FOR KNOWN COMPLIANCE THAT'S ABOUT 30%. OFF THEIR BENEFIT CHAT DAY OF DEALS RATHER HE WILL REALLY TAKE AWAY THE FOOD ON THE TABLE AND KEEP. GUESTS ALL OF THE TANK. SO DO A BILL WILL BRING A WELFARE AND INSTITUTE INSTITUTIONAL CLOTHING INTO A LION. WITH THE OTHER PORTION OF CALIFORNIA LAW RELEVANT TO TRUANCY AND HUMAN LIFE IN MY LIFE DACIAN. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK REPORT IS -- JESSE BOTTLE OF TO YOU WESTERN CENTER OF LONG M. PROPERTY. AND JENNER'S CONALL OWN OFFERED CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. HI MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A COMMITTEE JESSICA BARTLETT WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AS YOU HEARD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAY -- THESE -- CURRENT PENALTIES AND THE LAWS ARE DEEP AREAS WHERE FAMILIES ARE IN ENCOURAGED AND IN FACT REQUIRED T. TO IMMUNIZE THEIR CHILDREN OR REQUIRE THAT THEIR CHILDREN ATTEND SCHOOL. IT IS SCIENCE SHOWS THAT IMMUNIZATIONS ARE GOOD FOR KIDS AND THEY'RE NOT ONLY GOOD FOR KIDS THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT -- CLINICALLY DISEASES A STATE TO A MINIMAL AND THAT PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING -- IS PROTECTED. WE SWEATERS AND ALONG POVERTY SUPPORTS IMMUNIZATION UP BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IN SCIENCE THEN YOU ALSO BELIEVE -- THE REPORT AND THE NUMEROUS RESEARCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE THAT PROVE THAT MAKING A FAMILY POOR -- DOESN'T ACTUALLY HELP THEM TO BECOME VACCINATED. IF YOU BELIEVE IN SCIENCE YOU KNOW THE REPORTS SAY THAT IF YOU ATTEND COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL AND YOU -- FINISH SCHOOL YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO EXIT POVERTY AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE BEST PASS OUT OF POVERTY -- BUT THE SIZE ALSO SHOWS. THAT MAKING FAMILIES POOR -- DOESN'T HELP THEIR CHILDREN. AT THE SCHOOL IT DOESN'T HELP THEM STAY IN SCHOOL IT DOESN'T HELP THEM GRADUATE. US SO WE ARE IMMENSELY PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND AND TO SPONSOR IT. AND WE URGE ARRIVAL AND IN SUPPORT OF CHILDREN AND OTHER LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT THEY RESIDE. AFTERNOON JANICE CAM WITH CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND I'M HERE IS A PROUD I'M A CO SPONSOR OF AB. TWO EIGHTY THREE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND A SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT TO REMOVE THE COW WORKS PENALTY FOR NOT VACCINATING. LET'S BE CLEAR CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA AND CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND NATIONAL HAS A NEARLY FIFTY YEAR RECORD. OF SUPPORTING REQUIRED IMMUNIZATION FOR ALL CHILDREN. OUR ORGANIZATIONS POSITION IS THAT THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE REASON FOR NOT VACCINATING. IS WHEN A CHILD'S MEDICAL CONDITION CONTRA INDICATES THAT. HOWEVER WE NEED EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT FAMILIES TO ENCOURAGE IMMUNIZATION. STRATEGIES THAT WILL SUPPORT AND EMPOWER FAMILIES TO ACCESS ALL THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM. IN MEDI CAL. NOT POLICIES THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE AND DRIVE FAMILIES FURTHER INTO POVERTY. WE SUPPORT POLICIES THE BUILD ON FAMILY STRENGTH AND AVOID CREATING BARRIERS STIGMA AND FURTHER HARDSHIPS. PENALTIES ARE AN ILL CONCEIVED POLICY ATTEMPT TO FORCE FAMILIES TO VACCINATE OR RISK THEIR CAO WORKS BENEFITS. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER ANYMORE IF THESE WILL WORK BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY DON'T. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT FAMILIES LIVE IN POVERTY FAMILIES LIVING IN POVERTY ARE NOT SERVED BY. BY A PENALTY CUTTING INTO THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES. SEVERAL STATES HAVE ATEMPTED PENALTIES AS A STRATEGY AND A STUDY REVIEWING A FDC PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE. IN MARYLAND FOUND THAT ECONOMIC SANCTIONS DON'T AFFECT BANKS VACCINATION RATES. A SIMILAR STUDY FOUND ON WHICH PROGRAMS FOUND THAT SUPPORTING AND EDUCATING FAMILIES. DID INCREASE IMMUNIZATION RATES. PENALTIES BUILD AN ARCHAIC IDEAS ABOUT RACE AND CLASS. AN IDEA THAT PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY NEW TWENTY FORCE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. PENALTIES NEGLECT WHAT WE KNOW WORKS PROVIDING HEALTH EDUCATION. HELP WITH TRANSPORTATION. ELECTRONIC IMMUNIZATION RECORD KEEPING. EXPANDING CLINIC HOURS AND OTHER CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND BURDENS ON FAMILIES. FOR THESE REASONS CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IS CO SPONSORING AB. TWO TWO EIGHTY THREE BECAUSE REMOVING THE PENALTIES NOT DRIVING FAMILIES INTO FURTHER HARDSHIP. IT'S A MUCH BETTER. MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH IMMUNIZATION THE COW WORKS PENALTIES HAVE EVER BEEN THANK YOU. THANK. YOU FOR BEFORE THAT -- WE DO HAVE A QUORUM AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE ROLE PLEASE. RAZ I HEAR MY OFFICE HERE ARAMBULA. CHOI HERE FRIEDMAN. GIPSON. MAIENSCHEIN. STONE. THANK YOU WE DO A POOR. KEVIN AS THE COLUSA CALIFORNIA ONE RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL FONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MOVE THE BILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ONE HELLO WELL THE PROJECT ON BEHALF OF EDUCATE ADVOCATE AND EMPOWER FAMILY CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT TO THE MEMBERS QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS STRIPS. OF JUST WANT TO SAY TO THE AUTHOR THE BILL'S THINGS A GOOD BILLS I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR TODAY -- I THINK WE SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZING -- PARENTS INCOME FAMILIES SPECIAL THOSE WERE STRUGGLING THROUGH -- ECONOMICS -- BUT I THINK THIS IN THIS AND SO -- WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] CHOI. THANK YOU I ALSO WOULD LIKE -- TO ASK A QUESTION AND THEN I DO. UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT -- BR AT THE ARE TRYING -- TO MAKE IT UP. LHASA. CUMBERSOME. FOR OTHER FAMILIES SO WILL RECEIVE A CAD WORK UP AND BENEFITS -- BUT IT IS -- NOT DEBATE NOT TO DEBATE THE THE FOXY NATION. IN A REQUIREMENTS WHETHER THE GOOD OR BAD. MAY UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT THE WIDE THIS WAS MAY. TO REQUIRE. OXIDATION PROOFS OF BEFORE THE BENEFIT CAN BE RECEIVED THAT BECAUSE MAYBE BECAUSE SAID NOT YEAH. PROBABLY MANY -- PEOPLE WERE AMONG THE CAL WORKS TO RECIPIENTS SO -- CHILDREN DID NOT THE VACCINATION SO USUALLY UP. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS -- THE SCHOOL IS STILL REQUIRE VACCINATION PROOF SO. AT THE HEALTH AND ROMAN. SO THIS IS SO YOUR UNNECESSARY WORK WHEN THEY APPLY. FOR FOOD STAMPS NO THE BENEFITS. SO IT IS -- ELIMINATING ONE MORE GOVERNMENT RATS IN A WET PAPER SO I'M OR FOR THAT THE US. BUT THE HOW IF AND WHEN. IF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN. ARE AMONG. OUR LOW INCOME FAMILY TEND TO BE -- HIGHER THAN. MAYBE AT THE GROUP WAS CHILDREN SO -- ARE THERE ANY. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FREE VACCINATION. CENTERS SO WHAT. THEY ARE GIVEN -- FREE VACCINATIONS. FOR OUR CHILDREN FROM THE LOW INCOME FAMILIES I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE WE NEED TO FOCUS UPON AND HELP THEM. AND NOT TO AFFECT THAT THERE. ARE A MONTHLY WHATEVER'S HAPPENED THEY RECEIVED. A RATHER THAN PENALIZE THING. SO WHAT IS A NOTHING YOU KNOW TO A MAN YOUR BILL AT THIS MOMENT BUT THE SINCE YOU SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS AREA. MY YOU KNOW INTEREST WOULD BE. FOR YOU TO FOR THE LOOK INTO. AND THE PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. UP FOR CHILDREN TO GET THE FREE VACCINATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A YOU KNOW FREE BUT THE NATION -- ALSO SOME OF THE FAMILIES HAVE TRANSPORTATION ISSUE. SO WHAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE THE CONTINUE WORKING WITH FROM AND PROVIDE THEM THE TRANSIT -- TRANSPORTATION AND ALSO RECEIVING THE BUT THE NATION GO GO A 100% CORRECT IS ALREADY IN OUR THE EDUCATIONAL COLD TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. ALL CHILDREN IN A ROLE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL OF HAVE TO SHOW SO ON THIS IS JUST REMOVED TO YOU A DUPLICATE REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE CAL WORK OF A RECEIVING. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CHOI MR MATHIS. THIS IS A REAL QUICK GUIDE. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS AND ENDS CUTTING SOME OF THE RED TAPE THAT'S IT AND THE WAY TO MAKE SURE FAMILIES GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED ESPECIALLY FOR THE KIDS SO -- YOU'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT ON THIS TODAY THANK YOU VERY SHARE. I I ALSO WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TAT WE WE ALL UNDERSTAND ATTENDANCE IS IMPORTANT WILL UNDERSTAND IMMUNIZATIONS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO OVER BURDENED FAMILIES THAT ARE ALREADY -- AT THE POVERTY LEVEL THAT ARE REQUESTING BENEFITS AND TO PUT SOMETHING ELSE ON ANOTHER REQUIREMENT. FOR THEM I THINK THAT THAT IMPOSING FINANCIAL PENALTIES IS JUST NOT THE WAY TO GO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE WITNESSES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS ALL RIGHT -- MR TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MATHIS SECOND BY MISTER GIBSON TO PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE RAMOS HI YES I AM MATHIS. MATHIS AYE ARAMBULA. CHOI HI CHOI I FRIEDMAN. GIPSON. GIPSON AYE MAIENSCHEIN. STONE [inaudible] STONE AYE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE VOTE IS CURRENTLY. FIVE WE'RE GOING TO FIVE TO ZERO WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS. MR FRAZIER TO LIKE TO PRESENT ON ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. THREE ONE ONE THE BILL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF EIGHTY THREE ONE ONE WHICH WOULD REPEAL WELFARE AN INSTITUTION CODE. FOUR SIX NINE OH POINT. SIX CURRENT CODE THAT SAYS DEFINITIONS OF FULL AND HALF A REIMBURSEMENT FOR SERVICES CONTRACTED BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS. ALMOST A DECADE AGO DEFINITIONS FOR BILLING WERE MAY MANDATED. AS A COST SAVINGS MEASURE FOLLOWING THE RECESSION WHEN SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS WERE DRASTICALLY CUT. FOR YEARS THE CODE SECTION HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HALF THE BILLING REQUIREMENTS OCCURRING IN JUST. THE LAST YEAR. AS THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DECEPTIVE ABILITIES. I HAVE HEARD FROM PROVIDERS THAT HAVE. THAT HAVING TO MANAGE THE HALF AND FULL THE BILLING RECORDS CREATES AN ADDITIONAL PROGRAM MANAGEMENT BURDEN. AND AS NICK NEGATIVELY IMPACTED MULTIPLE SERVICES SERVICES PROVIDERS WHO HAVE REPORTED LOSSES AS RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING THE HALF DAY BILLING. RULE. WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO EXPERTS BERRY GIORGINI. REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES. ASSOCIATION AND WILL SANFORD FROM FUTURES EXPLORED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS VERY JOURNEY FROM THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRAZIER FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. AS HE MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS THERE THIS HAVE TO BILLING PROGRAM AND THE RULES AROUND HALF A BILLING ARE A RELIC OF THE RECESSION ERA. CUTS THAT WERE FACING THE STATE DISABILITY SYSTEM. YOU KNOW DID ARE WE CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN OUR SHARE DURING THAT DEBT DURING THAT TIME AND WE'RE WE'RE NOW DECADE BEYOND THE GREAT RECESSION AND YET WE'RE STILL LIVING WITH SOME OF THESE RECESSION ERA CUTS. THE HAVE THE BILLING -- RULES IN PARTICULAR ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR ONE SET A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO ATTEND PROGRAM FOR MORE THAN 65% OF THE DAY. IN ORDER TO BILL FOR FULL DAY -- WAS 65% I MEAN EVEN IF IT WAS A HALF DAY BILLING YOU KNOW 50% WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE BUT MORE BROADLY IT CREATES A LOT OF CHALLENGES BOTH FOR PROVIDERS OF SERVICES AND CONSUMERS THEMSELVES. FOR PROVIDERS WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS THERE'S NOTHING IN THE REGULATIONS WHICH REQUIRE US TO TRACK -- FOR TIME FOR THE DAY SO TYPICALLY WHAT'S IN STORE COULD IN THE CASES OF SOMEONE'S IN PROGRAM FOR THE DAY IT'S A ONE AND IF THEY'RE NOT THERE. TO ZERO SO BY IT RE IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM YOU KNOW JUST FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE START OF THE FISCAL YEAR -- LAST ARE FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR YOU KNOW PROVIDERS HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING SYSTEM TO TRACK THESE THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HAVE TO BILLING -- AS FAR AS CONSUMERS GO IT ALSO MEANS YOU KNOW THIS IS A FINANCIAL HIT TO PROVIDERS I KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS YOU KNOW PUT A PRICE TAG ON IT BUT I I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S REALLY CAPTURED THE THE TRUE REFLECTION I THINK. ONE OF OUR PER AND REVENUE I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SYSTEM IS ALREADY CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED SO ANY OF THESE CUTS BEING BROUGHT BACK IS USUALLY PROBLEMATIC -- AND FROM A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A PROBLEM WE HAVE WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE CLOSING WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE HURTING -- AND WEIGHTLIFTING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HIRE STAFF EVERY DOLLAR THEY'RE NOT PULLING IN AND REVENUE IS ANOTHER DOLLAR THEY'RE NOT PUTTING INTO SERVICES. FURTHERMORE SOME OF THOSE CONSUMERS WHO HAVE COMPLICATED ATTENDANCE RATES MAY END UP FINDING THEMSELVES NOT BEING SERVED BY A PROVIDER GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE IT WORK I MEAN PROVIDER STILL HAVE TO STAFF FOR THE FULL DAY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY'S THERE FOR THREE HOURS AND FIFTY SIX MINUTES. OR THREE HOURS AND FIFTY EIGHT MINUTES SO YOU KNOW FOR THESE REASONS WILL -- ADMINISTRATIVELY AND FINANCIALLY AND AND ON THE IMPACT CONSUMERS MOST PRINCIPALLY -- WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE HOPE FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. WELL SEVERAL FEATURES EXPORTER THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE WHEN WE BROUGHT TO HIM WHEN IT CAME OUT JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH THAT WE HAD EMPLOYMENT ON JULY FIRST. THE IMPACT TO CONSUMERS REALLY IS WE ARE IN AN AGE OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS AND HIGH BELIEVES THAT OUR FOLKS TO BE VALUABLE AND CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY. TO DO THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE TREATED IN THE THIS BILL OR THIS THE WAY THIS IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. WE HAVE FOLKS WHO COULD GO AND MEET OUR FOLKS AT BART RIDE WITH BART COME BACK THEN GO HOME FROM THAT VERSES COMING TO A LOCATION A CENTER. WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM A FULL PROGRAM DAY. THEY MADE US APART INDEPENDENTLY THEY GO THEY DO THEIR ACTIVITIES THEY DO WHAT THEY WANNA DO THEY GO HOME. THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR HALF A DAY. SO OUR STAFF PURSUE SUPPORTING TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT ENTIRE TIME. WE'VE LOST THAT REVENUE FOR THAT THAT THING IN OUR CASE IT'S ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH WHICH IS ABOUT THE EQUIVALENT THREE DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. I CAN'T ELIMINATE. A STAFF PERSON TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO FOLKS STILL NEED SUPPORT. SO THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS YOU KNOW BASICALLY WAY FOR THE STATE TO SAVE MONEY I WAS THERE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TEN I WAS A PART OF THE GROUP THAT WAS TASKED WITH TRYING TO SAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. AND WAS ALWAYS SO WE CAN DO THIS IN THAT SHORT TERM TEN YEARS LATER. HE GOT REIMPLEMENTED AND REALLY DOES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HOW FOLKS CAN REALLY BE AND COMMUNITY AS WE GO FORWARD AND MOVE FORWARD -- WE HAVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS UNDER SYSTEM THAT'S DEPENDENT ON US. ENCOURAGE OUR FOLKS TO BE INTEGRATED IN INDEPENDENT THE COMMUNITY. THIS WORKS IN THE EXACT OPPOSITE WAY BECAUSE IT IS IN IN FROM REINFORCES PEOPLE TO GO TO A LOCATION TO BE THERE ALL DAY. BECAUSE THEN I GET A FULL DAY BILLING. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO. BUT THAT'S WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO CHRISTY THOUGHT A BRIDGE AND ON BEHALF OF EDUCATE ADVOCATE EMPOWER FAMILY CALIFORNIA HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WRECK ROLLINS REPRESENT HARKIS SO SHE XIN REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE IN. SUPPORT OF OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY AND WE CLEAN THIS UP.

THE OWNER TO HAVE YOU MORE [inaudible] YES SIR [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] PLACE. YOU CAME TO THE RIGHT COMMITTEE THE I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT MANY OF US ARE UNAWARE OF UNTIL IT'S BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU FOR BEING THAT PERSON BRINGS IT FORWARD. ALL RIGHT. WE DO HAVE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST THAT AGAIN YOU ACKNOWLEDGE. TO THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN PUMMELED USUALLY IT'S THE IT'S THE AREA THEY GO CUT FIRST WHEN THAT WHEN THERE'S A RECESSION BUT THEY FORGET TO RESTORE. AFTER AFTER WE'VE BECOME FLUSH. WEARE IN DIRE NEED OF PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE THIS YOU KNOW DISABLED POPULATION AS A WHOLE -- AND YOU LOOK AT HOW WE TREATED THIS THIS ENTITY. WHO'S TAKING CARE OF THE MOST FRAGILE. AND TRYING TO CREATE SUSTAINABILITY. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MOVING FOR THIS BILL AND AND THANK YOU FOR THE OFFICE OF CO AUTHOR. BUT THIS REALLY DOES NEED TO GO FORWARD AND MAKE THIS RIGHT AS ONE OF THE STEPS TO SUPPORT AN INDUSTRY THAT ABSOLUTELY IS ESSENTIAL IN THE CARE OF THESE PEOPLE. THANK YOU. I RESPECT THIS RED BOOK. GOOD ENDING HOWEVER WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MATHIS A SECOND BY MISTER GIBSON. MOTION IS TO DO PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE. RAMOS I YES I AM MATHIS. MATHIS I ARAMBULA. CHOI. CHOICE I FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN AYE AYE GIPSON [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] STONE [inaudible] STONE I IF FIVE ZERO WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS PSYCHOMETRIC THANK YOU. SOME MISTER MISTER BONTA. ITEM NUMBER SIX ACR ONE MR BONTA. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR IN COLLEAGUES IN STAFF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. A C. R. ONE ACR ONE CONDEMNS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSED CHANGES. THAT TARGET ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND CAUSE HARDSHIP TO UNTOLD. NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR OWN AMERICAN DREAM. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS RUN CONTRARY TO CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND BIPARTISAN EFFORTS THAT RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF SUPPORTING AND INCLUDING IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS IN OUR STATE. UNDER THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT AN INDIVIDUAL SEEKING ADMISSION TO THE US OR SEEKING TO OBTAIN LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS MAY BE DEEMED INADMISSIBLE. OR DENIED PERMANENT RESIDENCE IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS LIKELY AT ANY TIME TO BECOME WHAT'S KNOWN AS A PUBLIC CHARGE. ON OCTOBER TENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY PROPOSED NEW REGULATIONS REGARDING PUBLIC CHARGE DETERMINATIONS THE REGULATIONS WOULD EXPAND THE LIST OF BENEFITS CONSIDERED WHEN MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. TO GO BEYOND CASH ASSISTANCE WHICH IT HAD BEEN THINGS LIKE KENNETH AND CAL WORKS. TO INCLUDE MEDICAID MEDICARE PART D.. THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR SNAP SECTION EIGHT HOUSING VOUCHERS AND OTHER FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED HOUSING PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE AGE OF AN INDIVIDUAL. BEING UNDER EIGHTEEN FOR OVER SIXTY ONE WOULD BE SEEN AS A NEGATIVE. I WOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE ABSENCE OF CURRENT EMPLOYMENT OR LACK OF PROSPECT OF EMPLOYMENT THE USE OF PUBLIC BENEFITS ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND INCOME LEVEL SO LITERALLY IF YOU'RE YOUNG OR IF YOU'RE OLD IF YOU'RE. SICK OR IF YOU'RE POOR ALL WOULD COUNT AGAINST YOU. THIS LATEST MOVE IS AN ATTACK IN MY VIEW ON CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH AND WELL BEING THESE PROPOSED CHANGES TARGET LOW INCOME WORKING IMMIGRANTS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND LOW WAGE LABORERS HEALTH CARE ACCESS HOUSING AND NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HELP ALL PEOPLE. AND THEIR FAMILIES STAY HEALTHY WORK THRIVE. AND CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY AND THESE CHANGES HAVE REAL IMPACTS WE'VE SEEN THEM ALREADY. THE FEAR OF BEING DEEMED A PUBLIC CHARGING DENIED LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS OR ENTRY TO THE US OR POTENTIALLY BEING SUBJECT TO DEPORTATION. FOR SEEKING ESSENTIAL BENEFITS CREATES ADDITIONAL FEAR AMONG OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND IT ALSO CREATES A CHILLING EFFECT. THAT WILL UNDERMINE ACCESS TO THESE CRITICAL THING OF NOTE IS. OVER 70% OF THE LIVES TOUCHED BY THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS OUR CHILDREN. INVESTING IN NUTRITION HEALTH CARE AND OTHER ESSENTIAL NEEDS. KEEP CHILDREN LEARNING PARENTS WORKING AND FAMILY STRONG. SO YOU SEE ARE ONE CONDEMNS THE PROPOSED CHANGES AND URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RECONSIDER. AND ROLL BACK THESE CHANGES WHICH WILL LIKELY HARM THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THE STATE AND THE NATION. FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE LARGEST IMMIGRATION POPULATION AS A STATE IN THE NATION BOTH DOCUMENTED AND UNDOCUMENTED. AND AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. CALIFORNIA IS STRONGER WHEN RESIDENTS IN NEED ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT SAFETY NET WITHOUT FEAR FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILY. OR THEIR FUTURE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE ON ACR. ONE AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS DEPEND GAG ASIA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. A CO SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION AND JUSTIN RAZA REPRESENTING ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THE RESOLUTION. GET FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEPHEN BACK MOESHA I REPRESENT A CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR ACR ONE AND GUIDE CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO AND THE EXPANSION OF THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULE -- BY LEAVING THE PROTECTING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES CAMPAIGN FOR THE STATE. THE PUBLIC CHARGE RULES ENOUGH OF A CAN HAS LONG STOCK FEEL FEAR. AND AMONG IMMIGRANTS UNDER FEDERAL LAW A PERSON SEEKING ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES FOR TRYING TO ADJUSTER STATUS IS AN ELIGIBLE IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS DEEMED A PUBLIC CHARGE -- OR PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT FOR SUBSISTENCE. THE PROPOSED CHANGE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MARKS A DANGEROUS AND SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION FROM THE CURRENT RULED. HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS MAY BE UNABLE TO ADJUST THEIR STATUS AND COUNTLESS NUMBERS OF IMMIGRANTS WILL DESCEND ROLE FROM SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT KEEP THEIR FAMILY'S HOUSE FAT AND HEALTHY. EVEN THOUGH THE RULE CHANGE HAS YET TO TAKE A FACT I'M AS WAS MENTIONED FRONTLINE WORKERS ARE REPORTING MASS DESCEND ROLE MAN FROM PROGRAMS LIKE SNAP MEDICAID MEDICARE -- BUT EVEN THOSE THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED RULE LIKE WAKE PHAM WHICH KEEPS PREGNANT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WATCH -- ENABLES PREGNANT WOMEN CHILDREN TO GET THE CRITICAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE THAT THEY NEED -- THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT MAKE UP STRONG MEMBERS OF OUR STATE.

HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE DELIVERED HER TWINS WHILE ON MEDI CAL. AND DEMANDED FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REPAYMENT ON THE SPOT. THAT'S MONEY THAT OBVIOUSLY SHE DIDN'T HAVE AND THEY IMMEDIATELY DEPORTED HER ON A PLANE TO CHINA WITHOUT HER BABIES -- MY COLLEAGUES TRIED AND TRIED IN VAIN TO FIGHT THE CASE INDIVIDUALLY IN COURT BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE TWINS WERE RAISED IN OAKLAND BY THEIR GRANDMOTHER FOR TWENTY YEARS. TO US THIS IS PERSONAL THIS MOTHER WAS OUR PATIENT. WE PROMISE OUR PATIENTS SIGN UP FOR MEDI CAL YOU'LL BE SAFE.
