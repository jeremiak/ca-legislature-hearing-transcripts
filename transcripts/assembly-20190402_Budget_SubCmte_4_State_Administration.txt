SO WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON THE NUMEROUS ACTIVITIES THAT WERE DOING THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY TO PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS. WERE IN THE PROCESS OF TRAINING CALIFORNIA ELECTION OFFICIALS ON CYBERSECURITY PREPAREDNESS WITH MAINTENANCE PRACTICES CANNOT FIND WHICH NOT REPORTING AND ALL OF OUR IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE DOING ON A STATEWIDE VOTER REGISTRATION SYSTEM VOEPEL. WERE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING IN AS THE NEW LAWS WERE PASSED LAST YEAR REGARDING POSTAGE PAID FOR BY MAIL AN ENVELOPE DESIGN FOR PROVISIONAL BALLOT ENVELOPES. AFFIDAVITS REGISTRATION -- OUR REMOTE ACCESSIBLE VOTE BY MAIL TO BE EXPANDED STATEWIDE. ARE VOTE BY MAIL TRACKING SYSTEMS THAT WERE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AND THE ONLINE OFFICE HOLDER LOOK UP TOOL. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES WHO ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT MODEL FOR TWO AND TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPROVEMENTS FOR CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION AND WAIT TIMES. DURING THE PROCESS OF A DINNER PUBLICATIONS IN OUR FORESTS RELATED TO ALL THE NEW LEGISLATION. AND REDESIGNING OR VOTER NOTIFICATION CARD WERE IMPROVING THE PROCESS FOR THE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES AS WELL AS PREPARING FOR THE PRIMARY. AND PRIMARY ELECTION CALENDAR AND THE ELECTION GUIDE FOR THE PROCESS OF DRAFTING REGULATIONS RELATED TO RESPOND ANY DOT IT'S IN OUR VOTE CAL STATE WEBER REGISTRATION SYSTEM AS WELL AS UPDATING OUT REACH MATERIALS WHICH INCLUDES NOTICES FOR CROSSOVER VOTERS FOR PRESIDENTIAL. PRIMARY -- ARE ALSO EXPANDING THE VOTE SURE CAMPAIGN FOR CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS TO COMBAT MISINFORMATION REGARDING VOTING. AND SUSAN WILL GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE TESTING AND CERTIFICATION OF VOTING SYSTEMS THAT ABUSING. TWENTY TWENTY THANKS TENANTS. IN THE LAST FEW YEARS -- THE SECTOR STATE HAS SPONSORED AND AND HAVE LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN PASSED THE SPOT. LOTS OF CHANGES TO CALIFORNIA -- AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION -- ALSO ANYWAY AS JANET DISCUSSED OF ADMINISTERING THE ELECTIONS KNOWN AS THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT AND ALSO WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO BRING FUNDING FOR STATE AND VOTING SYSTEM UPGRADES AND REPLACEMENT -- IS A STATE SENATORS ATTRIBUTE THE AUTHORS SB THREE SIXTY WHICH TOOK EFFECT GENERAL ONE TWENTY FOURTEEN A PUT CALIFORNIA ON FRONT IN PURSUING EXPANDED OPTIONS FOR MORE MODERNIZING VOTING SYSTEMS. WHILE PRESERVING IN CODIFYING SOME OF THE HIGHEST STANDARDS FOR SECURE SECURITY TESTING AND CERTIFICATION OF VOTING SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY. AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE AGING VOTING SYSTEMS ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS THIS IS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE BRENNAN CENTER. THE BY PERSON PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION AND ART CALIFORNIA SO ON LA -- VOTING SYSTEMS IN THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE AT OR NEAR THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY MANY COUNTIES HAVE VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT PARTS THAT ARE NO LONGER MANUFACTURED SOME COUNTIES HAVE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU LIKE. UTILIZED OPERATING SYSTEM SO ALL THE VENDORS NO LONGER SUPPORT THEM AND THEY CAN NO LONGER FIND PARTS. AGAIN WITH THE HELP OF THIS COMMITTEE AND AND OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO UPGRADE OR PLACE AGING VOTING SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS BUDGET ALLOCATION WAS ESSENTIAL. IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS FOR ENSURING THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S VOTING SYSTEMS MEET THE MOST MODERN AND EXTENSIVE TESTING STANDARDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE WE REFER TO AS A CALIFORNIA VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS OR CVS S.. WE INITIATED THE PROCESS FOR WITHDRAWING THE CERTIFICATION OR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR VOTING SYSTEMS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY GRANTED IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED AND CERTIFIED TO CVS S.. MANY CALIFORNIA COUNTIES ARE ALREADY WELL ON THEIR WAY TOWARDS ADOPTING NEW CVS THAT'S COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS IN FACT TWENTY COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SUCH SYSTEMS AND MANY ARE IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS. FOR REFERENCE ARE CURRENTLY THREE VOTING SYSTEMS OF INTESTINE CERTIFIED TO CALIFORNIA BUT VOTING SYSTEM STANDARDS DOMINIONS VOTING. AT INKS DEMOCRACY THREE FIVE POINT TWO VOTING SYSTEM THE COUNTY LOS ANGELES VOTING SYSTEMS FOR ALL PEOPLE TELL THE SYSTEM ONE POINT. OH HEART INNER CIVICS VERY VOTING THREE POINT ZERO POINT. ONE AND IN ADDITION THERE ARE THREE MORE VOTING SYSTEMS CURRENTLY BEING TESTED RIGHT NOW WITHIN SECTORS STATES OFFICE FOR AT MEETING AND AND SO BEING CERTIFIED TO THE CVS S. AND THEIR DOMINIONS. DEMOCRACY SUITE FIVE POINT ONE ZERO L. A.'S AT THE SEPT TALLY TWO POINT. OH AND YES NESS AT WHICH IS ELECTION SYSTEMS SOFTWARE'S EBS SIX POINT ZERO POINT FOUR POINT. TWO THE WITHDRAWAL OF SERB OCCASIONAL CONDITIONAL APPROVAL IS EFFECTIVE AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH 2019% ELECTIONS CODE SECTION NINETEEN TWO THREE TWO ANY ELECTION CONDUCTED SIX MONTHS FROM OCT. AUGUST TWENTY SEVEN SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS ACTION. THEREFORE ANY FEDERAL STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL DISTRICT OR SCHOOL ELECTION FROM CONDUCTED FROM AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH THROUGH FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVEN TO TWENTY TWENTY MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE VOTING SYSTEMS PREVIOUSLY CERTIFIED. OR APPROVED EVEN IT IF IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AND CERTIFIED TO CBS S.. NOW HAVING SAID THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WORK IN CHALLENGE TO IMPLEMENTING A NEW SYSTEM VOTING SYSTEM FOR COUNTY MAY AND AND INVOLVE -- THERE MAY BE A UNIQUE SENSE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD IMPEDE JURISDICTION FROM PROCURING IMPLEMENTING A CVS A CERTIFIED SYSTEM BY FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTH THE TWENTY TWENTY INCLUDING SUCH THINGS AS DELAYS IN THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS OR COUNTY FUNDING OR BOARD APPROVAL. OR EVEN THE PRACTICAL JUST SIX OF TRAINING AND EDUCATING POLL WORKERS STAFFS AND VOTERS. THEREFORE FOR ANY ELECTION CONDUCTED AFTER FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY IN WHICH A COUNTY BELIEVES THEY NEED TO USE A DECERTIFIED SYSTEM A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR EXTENSION USE WILL BE CONSIDERED BY OUR OFFICE BY IF IT'S A MINIATURE US BY APRIL FIFTH TWENTY NINETEEN SO JUST. THIS FRIDAY. THOSE ARE BECAUSE MUST BE SUBMITTED TO US IN WRITING INCLUDES THE JURISDICTIONS JUSTIFICATION FOR EXTENSION OF USE OF THE PLAN AND SCHEDULE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE CVS CERTIFIED SYSTEM WHICH IT SHOULD INCLUDE. THE DETAILED PLAN FOR PROCUREMENT AND STAFF TRAINING AS WELL AS A SPECIFIC FINAL IMPLEMENTATION DATE. AS OF TODAY WE HAVE THREE AT A COUNTIES THAT HAVE REQUESTED EXTENSION TO US I ANTICIPATE THAT -- COME FRIDAY WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO US BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE DON'T KNOW WHO THOSE ARE IT -- BUT CAN PROVIDE AN UPDATE AT THAT TIME SURE THE SERGEANTS CAN CALL THE UP THE MEMBERS AND REPORT. IT QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU BEFORE YOU MOVE ON DO YOU KNOW WHICH COUNTIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO UPGRADE THEIR VOTING SYSTEMS. IN TIME FOR TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. SO I THINK THAT APRIL FIF DEADLINE WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF A BIRD RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AT TO COUNTIES THAT HAVE SUBMITTED OR THREE COUNTIES AND I'M GONNA FOR AND BLINKING ON THE THIRD -- ONE THAT HAVE ARE GOING TO DO A PHASED APPROACH SO THE THEY MAY NOT MAKE THAT -- FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTH DATE FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION BUT THEY'LL HAVE IT. PART WAY IMPLEMENTED THERE WERE TWENTY SEVEN FULL IMPLEMENTATION BY NOVEMBER. THANK YOU L. L. [inaudible] FINANCE. FOR EVERYBODY ON HOW MUCH MORE MONEY WOULD BE NEEDED TO BRING ALL COUNTY VOTING SYSTEMS UP TO DATE. SO I THINK THAT THE AS AS ELECTION OFFICIALS WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE FULL AMOUNT THAT WE HAD LOOKED AT WOULD COST FOR ALL COUNTIES IF ITS STATE PAID FOR EVERYTHING IS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION THAT WE RECEIVED IN THIS YEAR STATE BUDGET THE BUDGET WAS A WITH A ONE TO ONE MATCH SO FIFTY FIFTY MATCH FOR COUNTY SO. WE STILL MAINTAIN THAT FOR COUNTIES TO REPLACE THEIR FULL SYSTEMS AGAIN IF WE'RE PAYING FOR THE FULL BILL IT WOULD BE THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THERE'S WITH WHAT ROOM WHEN THEY'RE DEPENDING ON THE MATCHES AND AND ADD THE MODELS THAT WE GO WITH. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT WE CONSIDER ON GOING AND FUNDING OF ELECTIONS ON ONGOING BASIS NOT ONCE EVERY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS WHEN ALL THE WILL START FALLING OFF THE BUS. SURE AND MORE QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY ARE THERE ANY OTHER ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE FUNDED PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. TO HELP INSURE SUCCESSFUL. BOOK ASH BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS. I THINK THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT THAT WE HAVE IN OUR IN OUR AND BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT. AS WITH APPROVAL OF THOSE WILL GO A LONG WAY. MR TOO MANY QUESTIONS. A PROVIDING FUNDING FOR COUNTIES VOTING SYSTEMS FLICKING CARRY OUT ELECTIONS IS THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE. THE STATE APPROVED A HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR MILLION LAST YEAR HOWEVER THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH OF IT IS REFERRED. TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS MEET THE STANDARDS -- THIS WAS INFORMATION ONLY SO. THAT HAVE TO THIS ITEM THANK YOU THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER -- TWO CALIFORNIA PART OF THE VETERANS AFFAIRS. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME ALRIGHT. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BETH MISSION SKIN I'M CHIEF OF OPERATIONS FOR THE VETERANS HOMES VISION AND I HAVE HERE WITH ME TODAY THOMAS MARTIN. OUR DIRECTOR OF FUTURE OPERATIONS AND PLANNING. FIRST THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE -- THIS UPDATE ON RECENT RESEARCH AND PLANNING THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN DIRECTION THAT WAS GIVEN TO US A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- I WILL IF PROVIDED THIS WORKS FOR YOU I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE IN THIS PROJECT. AND THEN THOMAS AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT ANY VIEW OF TWO YEARS AGO AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE ASKED CALVET TO CONDUCT A MASTER PLANNING EFFORT FOR THE VETERANS HOMES. I BELIEVE THIS CAME FROM A COMMON OUR COLLECTIVE RECOGNITION THAT THE CALIFORNIA VETERAN POPULATION IS EVOLVING. IN ITS THE CLINICAL NEEDS AND IT'S AN AS ITS INTEREST AS NEW GENERATIONS OF SERVICE MEMBERS LEAVE THE MILITARY. RETURN TO CIVILIAN LIFE AND EVENTUALLY ARE IN NEED OF LONG TERM CARE SERVICES. INDEED WE ALREADY ARE SEEING SOME DIFFERENCES AMONG OUR OUR CURRENT VETERANS HOME RESIDENTS AND WE AGREE THAT OVER TIME VETERANS NEEDS AND INTERESTS. AND EXPECTATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO CHANGE. THIS CONCEPT PLUS MAKING SURE THAT THE STATE'S FUNDING AND RESOURCES CONTINUE TO BE SPENT MOST EFFECTIVELY AMID ALL THESE EVOLUTIONS ARE AT THE HEART OF THE DESIGN OF THIS PROJECT. WHAT WE ALL WILL GAIN FROM THIS FROM THIS OUR ANSWERS TO CERTAIN QUESTIONS WHO SHOULD WE BE IN TEN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS? WHAT DO WE DO BEST WHERE WE MOST NEEDED WHAT SHOULD WE PROVIDE TO CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS WHO ARE IN NEED OF LONG TERM CARE AND OTHER HEALTH SERVICES? IN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL Vì ã AND AS A COMPLEMENT TO THEIR PROGRAMMING. DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS A YEAR AFTER THE INITIAL DIRECTION THAT WAS GIVEN TO US THE LEGISLATURE ADDED SOME LANGUAGE AS WELL AS A COUPLE AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS. INCLUDING THAT OUR MASTER PLANNING EFFORTS BE ON GOING AND THAT OUR PRODUCT BE UPDATED REGULARLY. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS THE LATTER LANGUAGE PROVIDED AN EXTENSION TO OUR INITIAL JUNE THIRTIETH -- EADLINE AND OUR FINAL PRODUCT WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AFTER GETTING THE INITIAL DIRECTION WE EMBARKED ON DESIGNING THE PROJECT AND HIRED TO STAFF TO SERVE AS A RESEARCH TEAM. WE STRUCTURE THE EFFORT SO THAT IT HAS TWO PIECES TO IT THAT WE EXPLORED SIMULTANEOUSLY AND ARE MERGING IN A FINAL PRODUCT. THE TWO PIECES BEING A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHAT THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA VETERAN POPULATION WILL LOOK LIKE. WHAT THEY WILL NEED AND WHERE THESE SERVICES SHOULD BE LOCATED? AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE BEING A THOROUGH REVIEW OF OUR VETERANS HOME PROPERTIES WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS. OF WHAT ARE THE CREATIVE IDEAS AND WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM INDUSTRY -- AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. I'M PROUD TO SAY OUR RESEARCH HAS BEEN GOING VERY SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDING US SOME VERY VALUABLE INSIGHT AND LENDING ITSELF. TO TO WHAT I KNOW WILL BE A USEFUL TOOL FOR ALL OF THIS FOR ALL OF US. WITH THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THANK YOU. L. L. [inaudible] FINANCE. MR TO QUESTIONS -- FOR CALVET CAN YOU SHARE ANY PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM THE WORK YOU'VE DONE SO FAR TO VOTE THE MASTER PLAN. ANYTHING SURPRISING -- EXPECTED. I SURE SO US AGAIN MINES THOMAS MARNHAM DIRECTOR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND PLANNING -- SO WITH SO AGAIN WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL COLLECTING A LOT OF DATA WE'VE GOT A LOT OF DATA FROM THE VA FROM INDUSTRY VARIOUS ENTITIES -- ONE THING WHERE ONE THING WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY SEEING IS THERE WE KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A DECREASE IN VETERANS OVERALL -- COMING UP THE NEXT AT TEN TO TWENTY YEARS -- THAT'S KIND OF A NATURAL DECLINE YOU CONSIDER WE HAVEN'T HAD A DRAFT IN WHILE. AND WE'RE GONNA SEE A REDUCTION OVERALL IN THE NUMBER OF VETERANS BUT THE THE PART THAT'S GONNA BE MORE COMPLICATED THOUGH IS THAT THE RESIDENT THE VETERANS -- VETERANS WILL BE HERE IN TEN TWENTY YEARS THEY'RE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO HAVE VARIOUS. HEALTH CARE NEEDS TO INCLUDE LONG TERM CARE IN PARTICULAR -- SO YOU KNOW OUR OUR AGE ARE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO HONE IN ON IS KIND OF WHERE THAT WITHOUT NEXUS IS YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE TWO LINES MAYBE CROSS -- TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT THE ACTUAL WITH THE ACTUAL DEMAND AT THAT TIME AS BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER DAY WHAT'S GOING TO BE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IS IS -- IDENTIFYING -- THE BEST APPROACH TO TO MEET THOSE DEMANDS A RALLY IS YOU KNOW WE WE BEING TELL THAT TO THE STATE -- THAT WE CAN WIN THERE ISN'T THERE ARE INFINITE RESOURCES PRIDE EVERY TYPE OF SERVICE TO EVERYONE SO IT'S REALLY MATTER OF IDENTIFYING WHERE. WHERE CALVET IS THE BEST POSITION TO PROVIDE SERVICES WHAT TYPES OF VETERANS -- EITHER BASED ON THEIR NEEDS AND OR THEIR SERVICE RECORDS -- WHERE WE ARE BEST POSITIONED TO SERVE THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST -- IT'S GOT ITS IS ALONG THE LINES OF BELIEVES TWO YEARS AGO. AND WE HAD A BUDGET PROPOSAL APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO CHANGE HOW WE HOW WE PRIORITIZE -- VETERAN APPLICANTS SO WE PRIORITIZE VETERANS WHO HAVE SAID YOU PERCENT OR GREATER SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY RATINGS WE PRIVATIZE VETERANS WHO ARE HOMELESS -- TO TRY TO TO TRY TO FOCUS OUR LIMITED RESOURCES ON THOSE WHO EITHER NEED US THE MOST OR SACRIFICE THE MESSENGER SERVICE. SO A LOT OF THIS MASTER PLAN -- NEEDS THAT'S BEEN APPROACHES CAN BE BASED AROUND THAT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ALLOCATE OUR RESOURCES TO THOSE WHO NEED US THE MOST. NOT NECESSARILY JUST ON WHAT THE ACTUAL DEMANDES. DO YOU THINK IS THE COLOR PROCESSES BEEN EFFECTIVE. YES ACTUALLY BEEN VERY HELPFUL -- IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY EASY TO YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE HOW WE'VE ALWAYS OPERATED IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO GETS -- OTHER PEOPLE TELL US EITHER WHERE WHERE THEY SEE THE NEED IS IN THERE COMMUNITY WHICH HAS BEEN FROM. ELECTED OFFICIALS LOCAL STATE -- FEDERAL -- WHERE? WHERE THEY SEE THE INDUSTRY HEADING -- WHICH WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING FROM -- INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS -- AND ALSO WHERE -- WERE VETERANS IN THE VERNE COMMUNITY IS GOING AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE -- WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING THAT FROM VARIOUS VETERANS SERVICE GROUPS AND ALSO OUR RESIDENTS THEMSELVES.

CAN AS WELL UNDER SIX CONSECUTIVE RECORD THANK YOU CONSUMER AFFAIRS ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD AND VARADA PLEASE PROCEED [inaudible] GOOD ACTORS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JANICE AND TALKING ON THE CHIEF FISCAL OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT -- THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY -- REQUEST FIVE POINT TWO MILLION IN TWENTY FOUR AND A HALF POSITIONS TO THE FOLLOWING FIVE ADMINISTRATIVE AN INVESTIGATIVE OFFICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRST BEING BUSINESS SERVICES IN FISCAL OPERATIONS WE REQUEST SEVEN POSITIONS AND FUNDING ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT WORK WHAT INCREASES ENHANCED AUDIT REQUIREMENTS AN EXCEEDINGLY COMPLEX ACCOUNTING PROCESSES. THESE RESOURCES WILL RESULT IN A MORE TIMELY RECONCILIATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING RECORDS FASTER PROCESSING OF INVOICES AND BETTER REPORTING OF EXPENDITURES AND REVENUE INFORMATION. THE SECOND OFFICE WERE ASKING FOR THE AUGMENTATIONS FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION THAT REQUEST THREE YEARS OF LIMITED TERM FUNDING TO SUPPORT SIX ATTORNEYS AND TO SUPPORT STAFF. TO CREATE A DEDICATED REGULATION UNIT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF REGULATION PACKAGES AND TO INCREASE OUTPUT TO MEET DEMAND. THE THIRD OFFICE IS THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION WE'RE REQUESTING FOUR AND A HALF INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS WITH FINDING ALONG WITH MEDICAL CONSULTING FUNDING TO ADDRESS INVESTIGATOR CASELOAD WORKLOAD AND THAT THE AGING OF CASES. THIS WILL RESULT IN A MORE TIMELY AND EFFICIENT AND HIGH QUALITY INVESTORS KATORI WORK. THESE COSTS ARE DIRECTLY FUNDED BY THE BOARDS IMPERO IS THAT USE THE SERVICES. THE FOURTH OFFICE BE IN THE OFFICE OF HUMAN RESOURCES THAT REQUESTS FORTY SIX THOUSAND TO FUND THE CONVERSION OF THREE PERMANENT INTERMITTENT POSITIONS INTO PERMANENT FULL TIME. TO ADDRESS RECRUITMENT AND RETURN TO WORK WORKLOAD. THIS WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT SERVICE LEVELS WITHIN OUR OFFICE OF HUMAN RESOURCES. AND THE LAST FIFTH OFFICE IS THE OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL EXAMINATION SERVICES WERE REQUEST TO POSITIONS AND FUNDING TO MEET THE INCREASED WORKLOAD FOR DEVELOPING MAINTAINING AND BIT INVALIDATING OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING EXAMINATIONS. SO WE THAT'S THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL A WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN HERE RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU L. L.. SO AS YOU HEARD THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF THIS -- PROPOSAL SUMMER FUNDED BASED ON USAGE SO SOMETHING LIKE AN HOURLY RATE SOME OF THEM ARE FUNDED BASED ON WHAT'S CALLED PER RAT I WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A WAY TO SPREAD COST OUT. ON TYPICALLY IT'S DONE BY POSITION COUNTS OF THE BOARDS IN EUROS PAY MORE IF THEY HAVE MORE POSITIONS LIKE THAT THEY HAVE YOUR POSITIONS. SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE FUNDED ON A PRO RATA BASIS THERE REALLY TWO REASONS FOR THAT THE FIRST IS THAT WE THINK THAT IT'S GENERALLY PREMATURE TO DO THIS -- THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE -- PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO DO YOU -- SOME BUSINESS PROCESS REVIEWS OF THEIR PRO RATA FUNDED SERVICES AND THEY'VE ONLY COMPLETED ONE A PORTION OF THOSE REVIEWS MOST OF THOSE REVIEWS HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED -- SO WE THINK THAT -- IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL THOSE ARE COMPLETED. AND THE SECOND. REASON IS THAT WE THINK IN SOME AREAS THAT WE'RE GOOD JUSTIFICATION IS LACKING -- EXAMPLE A THERE WAS A TRANSITION OF ONE OF THE BUREAU'S WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OUT -- TWO SEPARATE DEPARTMENT -- AND THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE SOME ASSOCIATED REDUCTION IN THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH -- PROVIDING SERVICES TO THAT BUREAU WHICH YOU DON'T THINK IT'S FULLY REFLECTED IN THE PROPOSAL ADDITIONALLY I'VE YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS NEW REGULATORY -- REVIEW UNIT WITHIN THE CA -- AND THE WORKLOAD JUSTIFICATION DOESN'T FULLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE SOME STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT THAT ARE REVIEWING -- REGULATORY -- SUBMISSIONS FROM BUREAUS IMPORTS AND SO WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE SOME OTHER REASONS FOR REJECTING -- THE PAROTID COMPONENT [inaudible] FINANCE. KITCHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE REQUEST AS PROPOSED AS DCA HAD NOTED -- THE RESOURCES FOR THAT A DEDICATED REGULATIONS UNIT AND THE ACCOUNTING FISCAL SERVICES. ARE REQUESTED A LIMóN TERM BASIS AND THESE ARE THE OFFICES THAT ARE FUNDED ON A PRO RATA BASIS -- WE THINK THAT'S PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS MORE IMMEDIATE ISSUES -- AND WORKLOAD INCREASES WHILE LYING FOR THE SUBSEQUENT EVALUATION OF ONGOING RESOURCE NEEDS BASED ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT REVIEWS -- WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FISCAL HAS SIGNIFICANTLY AND IMPACT TO THE DEPARTMENTS PROCESS SEES AND TO YOUR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES ARE NEEDED -- TO HELP ADDRESS THE THE INCREASE TO WORK WITH THE PROMISED SPERRIN SEEING. WERE ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE REGULATIONS UNIT BECAUSE THERE'S A CAPACITY ISSUE -- THE EXISTING STAFF SIMPLY JUST DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OF REGULATIONS INCLUDING INCREASED WORKLOAD FROM AB -- TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WE THINK A DEDICATED UNIT ONE PROVE THE QUALITY AND ALSO REDUCED EXISTING TIMELINES. FOR REGULATIONS WHICH HAS BEEN A CONCERN OF THE BOARDS -- AND HAS ALSO -- AS WELL IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL. THE REGULATIONS ISSUE -- WHAT IS? THE SORRY A IS THE PROVIDER WORKING GROUP'S HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT REVIEWS. AND WE KNOW THAT ESTABLISHING THIS DEDICATED UNITS OF CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT REPORT THAT ACTUALLY CAME OUT -- BASED ON THEIR FIRST ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT REVIEW -- AND THEN LASTLY JUST WANTED TO KIND OF SPEAK TO THE LA WAS COMMENT ON THE RESOURCES HAVING NOT BEEN REDUCED FOR THE BEER OF REAL ESTATE. SHIFTING TO A DEPARTMENT THERE WERE TWO PROPOSALS LAST YEAR THE ACTUALLY REDUCED UP -- THAT WERE APPROVED TO BEGIN REDUCING RESOURCES -- FOREVER SHIFTING THAT THE BEAR OUT. THANK YOU IT COMES IN COMMITTEE A QUESTION FOR MR. TO THANK YOU. LAST YEAR I SPENT A LOT OF TIME MY OFFICE AS WELL AS A STATEWIDE COALITION WORKING WITH THE CA AND THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS. ON THE TOPIC OF HOW DCA REFORMS THE WAY WHICH CRIMINAL RECORDS ARE CONSIDERED TO THE LICENSING APPLICATION PROCESS -- SPECIFICALLY -- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED THAT SAID THAT NON VIOLENT OFFENSES THAT WERE LONGER THAN SEVEN YEARS -- THERE WERE UNRELATED TO A LICENSE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AND AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE DCA TO PROMULGATE ABOUT FORTY REGUATORY PACKAGES BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS BILL REQUIRES ALMOST EVERY BOARD OR BUREAU TO UPDATE THE REGULATIONS. WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THE AGENCY PUT QUITE A LARGE PRICE TAG ON? THIS BILL AND APPROPRIATIONS AND IT HUSBANDSIGNED -- AND WE DON'T SEE ANY MENTION OF IT IN EITHER THIS ITEM OR THE THE ITEM THAT I SB HELD -- INVOLVING TWELVE OTHER BILLS THAT WILL HAVE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED SO I WANTED TO GET SOME RESPONSE AND WHITE THIS WAS NOT CALLED OUT. SURE ASSEMBLYMEMBER -- TO DEMOCRATS ROMERO DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION AT THE DEPARTMENT -- SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT I WAS BUILT INTO THE REGULATIONS UNIT -- THE THE GOAL THE REGULATIONS UNIT IS OBVIOUSLY TO MEET THE DEMAND AS A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS MENTIONED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PER YEAR -- BUT THE DIVISION CURRENTLY HAS A CAPACITY TO GET UP ABOUT -- TO PROMULGATE ABOUT FIFTY REGULATIONS UNITS -- REGULATION PACKETS PER YEAR PER YEAR -- THAT WAS WAS BILL -- TEN THE CHALLENGE FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT -- WITHOUT THE REGULATIONS UNIT -- PROGRAMS MAY HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION OF CHOOSING WHETHER TO IMPLEMENT TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT OR CURRENT EXISTING REGULATIONS PACKETS WE BELIEVE THE REGULATIONS UNIT WITH A DEDICATED UNIT THAT FOCUS SOLELY ON REGULATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE CAPACITY ISSUE. AND IMPLEMENT TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT OUT OF MY COLLEAGUE RYAN IS THE DEPUTY -- TO DIRECTOR OF THE LEGAL AFFAIRS DIVISION HE COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE IF YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COULD. WHAT YOU ARE TO SPENDING THE COST OF THAT TO BE? AND HOW WILL I KNOW THAT IF WE SEND THIS MONEY TO GUYS IT'LL ACTUALLY BE USED FOR THAT BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IT'S GOING TO BE A TRADE OFF AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THEIR NUMBER OF DCA DEPARTMENTS. OR BUREAUS AND BOARDS THAT HAD OPPOSED THE BILL AND I SUSPECT MAY NOT BE. ITCHING TO IMPLEMENT THIS. SO THE THE THE COST THAT WE HAVE -- OBVIOUSLY AS WE AS WE LOOK INTO THE REGULATIONS UNIT WE HAVE A IF I HAVE THE THE NUMBERS CORRECTLY -- ONE SECOND IT'S ONE POINT SIX SEVEN MILLION IN -- NINETEEN NINETEEN TWENTY IT IS A THREE THE THE POSITIONS ARE THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE ARE HITTING THE SWEET SPOT SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL POSITIONS THAT WE'RE SUGGESTS -- ABER. SUGGESTING -- AND AFTER THREE YEARS HOPEFULLY AFTER WE IMPLEMENT TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE THE BACKLOG THAT WE CAN COME BACK TO LEGISLATURE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE FOUND THE RIGHT APPROACH. SO THE PRICE TAG THE YOUR DEPARTMENT PLACED ON THIS BILL WAS TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND SO. THE DEPARTMENT THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING CREATING YOU'RE NOT EVEN SEND ALL OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO GO TO IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW. PROGRAM RIGHT. COULD I JUST GET SOME MORE CLARITY ON HOW MUCH WHAT FRACTION THESE RESOURCES ARE ACTUALLY AND GO. TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT IS NOW STATE LAW SURE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU -- AFTER THIS COMMITTEE HEARING OKAY I'M NOT PREPARED TO VOTE ON THIS TODAY. UNTIL I GET SOME ANSWERS TO THAT. NOT AVAILABLE MISTER CHOOSE QUESTIONS FAR AS THE THE CRIMES THAT THIS SERIES NON VIOLENT CRIMES AND SEE A LIST OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE NUMBER OF CRIMES THAT ARE. CONSIDERED NOT ANSWERS NONVIOLENT. THAT IN MY PERSONAL OPINION I BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THE PUBLIC OPINION. ARE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT SO. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A LIST OF OF THOSE CRIMES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDRESSING HERE. WITH THAT. SURE I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO THE CITY COULD HAVE BY THE END OF THE MONTH FOR HELEN. I BELIEVE WE COULD. COME UP WITH THAT AT AS WE ARE SO WE ARE SIMPLY IMPLEMENTING THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED AT LAST YEAR YOU'RE.% YOU'RE REFERRING TO AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY OR IS THAT CORRECT YES WE CAN PROVIDE THAT FOR YOU SURE -- L. L. -- THE ALREADY BUT IT ALREADY OKAY I LOST TRACK OF THAT -- ANYMORE QUESTION COMMITTEE. GOING UP A PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM I WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT -- SO I KNOW THE LA -- TOUCHED ON IT. BRIEFLY BUT I SELL WITH ME LAST WITH MR. TO IN THE BUDGET REQUEST WAS PREPARED BEFORE. THE REVIEW WAS COMPLETED. SO WE'RE HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR DISCUSSIONS THEY CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE THANK YOU. THE NEXT ITEM ITEM NUMBER SEVEN BUSINESS MOTIVATION PLAN IN BREEZES SYSTEM UPDATE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS BCP WITH YOU. MY NAME IS SEAN O'CONNOR AND WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICE OF INFORMATION SERVICES. THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF PHARMACY AND BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY OR TWO OF THE SEVENTEEN PROGRAMS CURRENTLY PROCEEDING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT'S BUSINESS MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE. THE BCP BEFORE YOU TODAY REQUEST ONE YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING IN THE AMOUNT OF FIVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FUND. FOR TOTAL STAFF POSITIONS TO FOR THE BOARD OF PHARMACY TO FOR THE BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY. THESE RESOURCES WILL ENGAGE IN CRITICAL PLANNING EFFORTS TO TRANSITION TO A NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM AS PART OF THAT EACH PROGRAM'S INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN WE REQUEST SUPPORT OF THE SPECIES P. RESPECTFULLY AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. L. L.. SO WE'RE NOT READING ANY CONCERNS WITH THE VC PEAS UNDER CONSIDERATION TODAY WE DID HAVE SOME LARGER COMMENTS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN AND THIS IS BASICALLY -- THE PLAN FOR THE REMAINING BOARDS IN BUREAUS THAT WERE ON THE ORIGINAL BREEZE PROJECT BUT THEN -- SUBSEQUENTLY BREEZE WAS TERMINATED AND SO THESE ARE THE BOARDS IN BUREAUS THAT ARE REMAINING AND THEY STILL NEED SOME I. T. SOLUTION -- SO OUR COMMENTS GENERALLY -- FOLLOW THAT THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT THAT THE BASICALLY THE DEPARTMENTS APPROACH HAS BEEN TO ALLOW THESE BOARDS IN BUREAU TO KIND OF MOVE AT THEIR OWN PACE THESE RELEASED THREE ENTITIES -- SO SOME OF THEM ARE MOVING MORE QUICKLY SOME OF THEM ARE MOVING LESS QUICKLY THE RATIONALE FOR THAT ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT IS BASICALLY THAT SOME OF THESE ENTITIES -- ARE HAVE MORE ORGANIZATIONAL READY NESTS CURRENTLY TODAY -- AND ARE PREPARED TO MOVE FASTER THAN OTHERS -- SO THAT MAKES SENSE TO SOME DEGREE BUT THERE ARE SOME REPERCUSSIONS -- SOME OF THESE ENTITIES ARE AS A RESULT MOVING MORE SLOWLY THAN OTHERS AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT -- AND THE CURRENT -- BUSINESS MODERNIZATION REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER REFLECT THAT SOME ENTITIES CURRENTLY HAVE KIND OF T. B. D. AS THEIR AS THEIR CURRENT TIMELINE OR TIME LINES THAT ARE SEVERAL YEARS OFF. AND SO WE THINK THIS MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE PROJECT AND IT RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT REALLY WHAT THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS IN TERMS OF OVERSEEING THESE PROJECTS AND HOW MUCH THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD TAKE A LEADERSHIP. ROLE INSTEAD OF MAKING SURE THESE BOARDS IN BUREAUS-- MOVE AT AT AT AT SORT OF RELATIVELY QUICK PACE I WOULD NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED LANGUAGE IN THE PAST THAT REQUIRED THIS REPORT AND REQUIRED UPDATES ON THESE TIME LINES. I'M SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE ENTITIES GOT THE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT THEY NEEDED IN A TIMELY FASHION -- SO OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO HAVE THE CA REPORTED HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE AS WELL AS THE RELEVANT BOARDS AND BUREAUS. I'M REALLY ONLINE. THE DEPARTMENT'S RATIONALE FOR THEIR APPROACH OF IN IN TERMS OF HAVING THESE BOARDS IN EUROS MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- AS WELL AS AS THE SPECIFIC REASON SOMEBODY'S ENTITIES NOW HAVE T. B. D. AS THEIR TIME LINES AND WE THINK THIS WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE. IN A WAY WHETHER IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE APPROACH THAT THE DEPARTMENT TAKING OR IF THE DIP AT THE LEGISLATURE AND WANTED TO DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A MORE HANDS ON APPROACH. TO TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THESE BOARDS IN BUREAUS -- GET IT SOLUTIONS. ON A FOLLOW UP ON ILLEGALS COMMENTS YOUR DC IS THE MOTHER SHIP. IS ALL YOUR KIDS. THE LETTER OWN DEVICES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S IT'S REALLY OPEN ENDED. WHEN THEY'RE GONNA DO THIS SO WE STARTED IT SO I MEAN AS WE SIT HERE TODAY? THERE IS NO DEADLINE FOR THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS FINISH CORRECT -- THERE'S ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL TWENTY SEVENTEEN PLAN -- THOSE WERE UPDATING THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN -- AS LA -- MENTIONED -- SOME OF THE TIME LINES APPEAR TO TO TO NEED TO BE UPDATED AGAIN SO RAPID PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION I'M ALSO PREPARED TO SPEAKING GIVE YOU A STATUS UPDATE OF WHERE ALL SEVENTEEN ARE SENSITIVE RIGHT NOW SO RIGHT NOW WHAT IS ARE. THAT YOU'RE FOR THE STOUT TIMELINE RIGHT NOW -- FURTHEST OUT TIMELINE AS FAR AS COMPLETION OF ON ENTIRE COMPLETE OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT. WILL OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WITH DIFFERENT TIMELINES. HI I'M I GUESS I'M ASKING WHAT IS YOUR WHOSE ALONG A TIME LINE RIGHT NOW -- I BELIEVE IT WAS ENDING ABLE IN -- THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE I THINK IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS THE LATEST PLANNED LAUNCH DATE RIGHT THE I MEAN SITTING UP HERE. WE WE STARTED IN EIGHTEEN IN LONG BEFORE THAT. AND IT'S GONNA TAKE TILL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE I MEAN I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT THE WAY YOU RUN ORGANIZATION ESPECIALLY THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS DRAGGING OUT. I THINK EVERYBODY NEW LABEL AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN AND GRANTED YOU HAVE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THE MAKE UPS. BUT A SOME POINT IT'S GOT TO COME TOGETHER. IN SETTLE A IN AND AND FUTURE COMMITTEE I THINK MIKE MY COLLEAGUES A C. MISTERS CHOOSE EXPRESSION ON THIS. THAT THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR US HERE. SO I'M JUST TELL YOU I'M NOT GONNA I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. UNLESS WE GET SOME STRICTER TIME WHETHER GUIDELINES EVEN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THERE TO PHONE TO DO THAT -- SO SO WHAT POINT DO WE GOT TO CUT THE SIPHON OFF. IT'S NOT JUST A FREE FLOW OF CASH. IS THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE -- FINANCED. THANK YOU -- OVERALL THE GOAL IS -- FOR TO GET THE REMAINING -- BOARDS EMBARRASSED OFF THE LEGACY SYSTEMS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE -- BUT ULTIMATELY THE PLAN NEEDS THE BOARD IMPAIR ROSE ENGAGEMENT AND ADEQUATE RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT THE IN THE AGENDA THAT LEO. IDENTIFIED CONCERNS WITH JUST FIVE OF THE BOARDS AND HEROES -- AND TERMS OF THE TIME LINES AND THREE OF THOSE BOARDS EMBARRASSED OF ACTUALLY SUMMIT OF APRIL ONE SPRING FINANCE LETTERS WERE RESOURCES TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES -- IN -- NINETEEN IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY AND WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THE PLANNED LAUNCH DATES FOR THOSE -- THREE ENTITIES ARE VERY CLOSE OR IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY AHEAD OF THE ESTIMATED TIME LINES INITIAL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT. QUESTION. MISTER. TO MY PLEASURE MISTER CHAIRS INITIAL COMMENTS AND HE'S HEARD ME -- SAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY BUT CERTAINLY FOR THE NEWER MEMBERS ON OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THIS IS A SUBCOMMITTEE THAT EVERY FEW WEEKS HEARS ABOUT ANOTHER. I. T. PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN A BUREAUCRATIC DISASTER AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER ONE AND LET ME JUST. SUMMARIZE -- THIS IS A PROJECT THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WITH A PRODUCT WITH A APPROVED BUDGET OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. IT STRETCH FOR YEARS -- THE PROJECT COSTS ROSE TO NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THE FINAL RELEASE WAS CANCELED AND IT IS NOW. 201-9 AND WE'RE NOW HEARING THAT ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT WHAT FINISH UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE LET ME ASK WHICH OF YOU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DATE. THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DATE WAS WORKED -- IN COLLABORATION WITH THE THE BOARD. THE BOARD SO -- WITHIN THE BIZ MODERNIZATION PLAN AND THOUGH I CAN'T RECALL WHICH SPECIFIC BOARD THAT WAS -- AT THE TIME OF THAT ALL THE SCHEDULES BASED ON TWO SPECIFIC THINGS OF PROBABLY MORE GRANULAR. DETAILS BUT THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE ASSIGNED TO THIS BUSINESS MODERNIZATION WHICH IS WORKING WITH ALL OF THE BOARDS TO IDENTIFY BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. OF A CURRENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT -- AS WELL AS THEIR OPERATIONAL NEEDS WHEN WE BEGAN CREATED THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PLAN WE BOTH SCHEDULED BASED ON THE RESOURCE AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONAL NEEDS. OF EACH BOREDOM BUREAU. SO THAT CREATED THE INITIAL SCHEDULE -- I WILL. SAY THAT I WE ABSOLUTELY HEARD YOUR FRUSTRATION IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS WITH EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND I WILL STATE I WILL SAY AND ASSERT THAT. THIS STRATEGY THOUGH I DO -- I DO RECOGNIZE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO BE A CONSIDERABLY FAR OUT. IS. A STRATEGIC -- POSITIVE STRATEGY. TO SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS AND I WILL SEE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PROJECTS WHICH SAYS SIX I'M SORRY SIR SUCCESSFUL WHAT SECTOR. SUCCESSFUL IN THE BUREAUCRATIC. HELL HOLE THAT YOU HAVE CREATED WITH THIS. THERE'S NO PROJECT IN ANY SECTOR THAT SIX YEARS LATER. IT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DAY RIGHT. I'M SORRY MAYBE IN YOUR MIND. BUT IN THE MEANTIME STARTED NO NINE IS VINCE BCP'S. ADDITIONAL FUNDING I MEAN SO IT'S NOT YOU CAN COME BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE SAME FRUSTRATION SO. GIVE US RESTORATION LAST YEAR AND NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED WE ARE A YEAR LATER. AND IF WE LET IT CONTINUE AS IT IS THE SAME THING IN TWENTY TWENTY SO I AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THE BRAKES ON RIGHT NOW YOU GUYS RESPONSIBLE YOU'RE IN CHARGE. THE SHIP START TO THE TOP SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE. BUT WE CONTINUALLY FUND YOU FOR YOUR REQUEST ME MORE MONEY WE NEED THIS WE HAVE BEEN VERY ACCOMMODATING IN THAT. BUT AT SOME POINT SOLICITED APPEAR IN THE ROOM SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT TIME OUT. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER. AND I'M NOT LAYING BLAME ON YOU IS JUST SYSTEMIC. BUT IT'S GOT TO BE FIXED AND I I MEAN MR CHOOSE BEEN. THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WITH THIS IS THE I. T.. I BILLS COMMITTEE FIVE YEARS SINCE I CAME IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK COMMITTEE AND IT'S THE SAME. STUFF THE SAME B. S. AND IT'S JUST IT'S JUST I'M DONE. THERE ARE NO MORE EXCUSES. NO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. GET TOGETHERS IT. IT'S NOT THAT COMPLICATED. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT? SO I JUST I MEAN WITH SOME STARTLING MONEY AT NOT DOING ANYMORE. SORRY MR TO NóI. HI I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WERE WERE ON THE SAME PAGE ON THIS BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WE'VE APPROVED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF IT PROJECTS AND WE'RE NOT SEEN ANY FRUITION IN FACT IT SEEMS LIKE. THE DATES THAT WERE SET KEEP STRETCHING SO I THINK FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IF YOU THINK IT'S STRATEGIC A STRATEGIC IF YOU'RE TRYING TO AVOID THE OVERSIGHT OF THIS COMMITTEE. BUT I HAVE SAID IN PRIOR YEARS THAT THERE IS GOING TO COME A POINT WHERE I CAN APPROVE THESE ANYMORE AND I FEEL LIKE. WE'VE HIT THAT POINT SO -- I HEAR EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF BUREAUCRATIC. MUMBLE JUMBLE THAT. FRANKLY I DON'T THINK CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PUBLIC HOW WE SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. I DON'T THINK IF YOU HAD THIS PROJECT TO DO IN ANY OTHER SECTOR THAT THERE IT WOULD BE ACCEPTED TO SAY THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS. A IS A DATE THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THINGS DONE IN IT THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO CHANGE THREE TIMES. BY THAT DATE SO -- I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTED HAVE FAITH THAT THE SELECTION AND GET ON I UNDERSTAND -- THE THINGS I WANTED TO RESPOND -- THESE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECTS FOR THE SEVENTEEN FOURTEEN GROSS -- ART WE'RE WE'RE ATTACKING EMERGE WRITING THEM AT SEVENTEEN INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AS WAS -- NOTED IN LESSONS LEARNED IN THE BREEZE PROJECT AS WELL AS THE STATE BOARD OF OF AUDIT SUGGESTED THAT A ONE OF THEIR FINDINGS WAS THAT WE ADDRESS -- THEIR NEEDS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND SO THE BREEZE PROJECT -- WAS ONE ONE LARGE PROJECT THAT WAS IT LIKE AS YOU STATED WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL FORTY BOREDOM HEROES IN THE END. TOOK -- IMPLEMENTED. TWENTY A WE TOOK THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT PROJECT AND WE CREATED AN OVERLAY AND A STRATEGY THAT I WAS. SPEAKING ABOUT BEFORE THAT WE BELIEVE -- CAN ADDRESS THE SEVENTEEN BOARDS AND THAT OVERLAY WAS SUCCESSFUL WITH THE CANNABIS -- IMPLEMENTATION THE AGILE -- IMPLEMENTATION THAT WE UTILIZE THEIR WHAT IS. BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE BREEZE PROJECT AS WELL AS OUR OWN EXPERIENCE -- LANDING RELEASED TO FOR BREEZE WHICH WAS WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED AS A MUCH BETTER IMPLEMENTATION AND RELEASE. ONE AND THAT CANNABIS PROJECT LANDED VERY WELL IN THE AGGRESSIVE TIME FRAME THAT WAS -- THAT THE LAW REQUIRED IN JAN. ONE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE. WE ARE ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THE BREEZE PROJECT THE LESSONS LEARNED STATE BOARD OF AUDIT FINDINGS AS WELL AS OUR OWN EXPERIENCE LANDING PRIEST TO BREEZE RELEASED [inaudible] TO AND SEVENTEEN PROJECTS -- HAVE PRESENTED TO YOU A SCHEDULE THAT IS TOO FAR OUT BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER THE SCHEDULE. TO RECONSIDER THE SCHEDULING AND TO BRING IN THAT DATE MORE BUT WE'RE REALLY AGAIN OVERLAYING THAT SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY THAT WORKED WITH CANNABIS VERY WELL. OVER SEVENTEEN TIMES AND SO -- THAT'S WHY THE SCHEDULES LITTLE IS IS -- ELONGATED -- I WILL SAY THAT THE FOLKS THAT WE WORKED WITH THE BOARD SKEWS ME THE BOARD'S RUSSELL WE'VE WORKED WITH. HAVE FOUND. GREAT VALUE IN THE ARTIFACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED IN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT I BELIEVE WERE -- UP ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT SESSIONS AND MY OVER STATING THAT -- EIGHT HUNDRED ARTIFACTS BUSINESS ARTIFACTS THAT HAVE COME FROM THAT. AS WELL AS THOUSANDS OF REQUIREMENTS THAT IS SHOW THE PROGRESS THAT -- THE FIRST COHORT TO FIRST GROUPING OF BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN -- PROGRAMS HAVE HAVE UNDERTAKEN -- AND SO I I JUST WANTED TO PERSIST PRESENT THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STRATEGY -- DONE OVER SEVENTEEN TIMES IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT IS CREATING A LOT LONGER SCHEDULE BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STRATEGY AGAIN VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH CANNABIS. IS. A PATHWAY FOR YOU -- TO TO BRING SICK MORE SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS TO BEAR LIKE CANNABIS WAS UNDER DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND AND JUST TO MORE OBSERVATIONS. I HOPE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE LEARNED LESSONS FROM WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO IN THE PAST BUT TYPICALLY IF YOU LEARN LESSONS YOU'RE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THINGS FASTER. IN THE FUTURE AND IT JUST SEEMS AGAIN IS TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- THREE MORE TERMS THROUGH MORE LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS OF NEW GENERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS WHO COME HERE IF WE'RE NO LONGER ON THIS COMMITTEE AND AND I'M JUST VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE CONTINUITY OF THIS SO -- I'M JUST NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS AT THIS TIME WHICH WE JUST NEED TO HAVE. BETTER PLANS AND AND MORE CERTAINTY THAT -- THAT -- THE HOUSES ARE BEING KEPT -- WELL. YES SO SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS I WOULD I LIKE FROM YOU WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO IS THE INITIAL ONE BREEZES STOOD UP INITIAL COST TO STAND RESULT. IN EACH YEAR. OF THE BC PIECES SUBMITTED AND HOW MUCH MONEY WAS REQUESTED AND GRANTED EACH YEAR. SO FROM -- NINE TO PRESENT DAY TODAY AND THEN ON THE HAND OUT ON PAGE FORTY THREE THE THE CHART YOU HAVE SOME THESE THINGS SAYS DELAYED -- DELAYED IS NOT ACCEPTABLE -- GIVE A SMART DATES AND NOT REALLY SURE WAS DELAYED. YOU'VE GOT ONE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE DID IN HERE BUT DELAYED COULD BE. TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN ALL AT WHAT POINT DO YOU NOT KNOW THE LATEST -- I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY IT IS -- THERE WE HAVE DATES THEIR WORK WAS OPERATIONAL -- NEED -- TO THE SCHEDULE FOR TOO SMALL OF OUR SMALLER BOARDS FOR A RESOURCE PURPOSES AND WERE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THOSE WE CAN BUT I THINK WHEN YOU COME THE PEOPLE THAT FUND YOUR PROJECT. NEED TO HAVE A HARD DATE. DO A DELAYED IS I MEAN I'M NOT UNDERSTAND THEY DOESN'T IT DOES NOTHING FOR ME. SO A LOT OF OUR COMMENTS HERE -- THE REMOTELY THIS ITEM WOULD HOLD OPEN. THERE'S FRUSTRATION HERE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST YEAR THIS IS NOTHING NEW NO NEW WORDS ARE BEING SAID TODAY. SO IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE THIS GETTING PASSED THROUGH. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. SO.
