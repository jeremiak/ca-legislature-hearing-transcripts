00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.833
COMPARED TO CURRENT PRACTICE

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.335

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:52.779
POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN HIGHER

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.114
PRODUCTION COSTS TO THE EXTENT

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.048
THAT THESE HIGHER PRODUCTION

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.217
COSTS BECAUSE SOME FARMERS TO

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.353
EXIT THE BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.054
REDUCE THEIR OVERALL PRODUCTION

00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.790
AND PROFITABILITY THERE COULD BE

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.391
REDUCE STATE AND LOCAL TAX

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:06.492
REVENUES.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.894
THE POTENTIAL DECREASE IN STATE%

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.695
AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES FROM FIVE

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:11.430

MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:21.908
ENFORCE THE MEASURE.

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:23.176
THAT DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.744
AGRICULTURE WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE

00:07:24.811 --> 00:07:26.646
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ENFORCE

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.147
THAT PROVISIONS.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:28.981

OF HOUSING USE FOR EGG LAYING

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:35.855
HENS ARE BREEDING PIGS AND CATS

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:36.756
REST RUBIO.

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:37.824
AND MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.792
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA TO SELL

00:07:39.859 --> 00:07:41.194
EGGS PARKER VEAL THAT WERE

PRODUCED FROM ANIMALS HOUSE IN

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.263
WAYS THAT DO NOT MEET THE

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.565
MEASURES REQUIREMENTS.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.500
SO THAT CONCLUDES MY OF REVIEW

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.902
FOR THE DAY I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.772

I HAVE I HAVE ONE QUESTION AND

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.748
THAT -- AT

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:03.749
AGE.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:05.051
THEIR REPORT YOUR REPORT

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.419
INDICATES THAT --

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:08.387
FEE.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:11.290
AND I WAS LOOKING FOR THE EXACT --

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.693
THAT MOST OF THE EGGS AND PORK

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:15.828
THE CALIFORNIANS EAT.

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:17.430
ARE PRODUCED IN OTHER STATES.

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:18.898
SO FOR TALKING ABOUT IMAGE DUMP

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.200
A MAJORITY ARE MOST OF THE EGGS

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.236
AND PORK --

00:08:23.302 --> 00:08:28.207
IT IN AND THAT PROJECT ENDS UP.

00:08:28.274 --> 00:08:30.009
IT IF THIS PROPOSITION PASSES IN

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.711
THE PRODUCT AND JEFF.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:34.347
IN CALIFORNIA HOW WOULD CALLASPO

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:37.250
WOULD OUR REGULATORY.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.452
AGENCIES DETERMINE THAT THE THAT

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:41.821
THE PRODUCT QUIZ.

00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:44.423
WAS GROWN PURSUANT TO OUR RULES

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.225
AND REGULATIONS AS OPPOSED TO

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.193
ANY OTHER STATE TO RULES AND

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.928
REGULATIONS.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:50.897
SO THAT'S WERE THE ARE ESTIMATE

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.031
OF COSTS THAT RANGING UP TO TEN

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:52.899
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:54.800
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.369
AND AGRICULTURE COME IN.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:57.870
AND WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THAT

00:08:57.937 --> 00:09:00.139
DEPARTMENT REGARDING THAT WHAT

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.674
THEY WOULD NEED TO PUT IN PLACE

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.010
IN ORDER TO ENFORCE THE MEASURE.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.679
AND THEY AYE SAID THAT THEY

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:09.148
WOULD NEED TO HAVE --

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.883
A SYSTEM IN PLACE POTENTIALLY A

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.220
LICENSING OR REGISTRATION SYSTEM

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:17.156
FOR OUT OF STATE PROVIDERS.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.324
ARAB OR AYE AYE STATE FARMERS

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.326
WHO PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS O

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:21.560
CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY WOULD

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:24.063
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.998
THAT PRODUCTS CAME FROM SOURCES

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:27.333
THAT MEET THE PROPOSITIONS

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.467
REQUIREMENTS.

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:30.002
AND THAT IN THE PROPOSITIONS

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.038
REQUIREMENTS BOUGHT SAY THAT ANY

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:32.838

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.640
PRODUCT.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:36.008
SO --

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:38.110
THEORETICALLY IF PEOPLE LEFT THE

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:41.847
STATE TO BUY NON --

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:45.051

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:51.857
PURCHASE.

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.526
BUT BUT IT REGULATES THE

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:54.894
PURCHASE UP PRODUCT BY

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.797
CALIFORNIA --

00:09:57.863 --> 00:09:59.265
RETAILERS I GUESS IS THE POINT

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.633
THE POINT I'M TRYING TO GET TO

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.834
IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.904
INCREASE THE COST FOR EVERYONE --

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.273

IT'S COMPLYING WITH WITH THESE

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.556
REQUIREMENTS BUT IT WOULD ALSO

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:26.525
INCREASE THE COSTS FOR CONSUMERS --

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.461
DICE.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.896
THINKING THAT DIE WHO WERE STILL

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:32.264

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:07.886
ALTHOUGH MANY PRODUCERS INVESTED

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:11.657
TO CONVERT KEY TREE AFTER THE

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.926

REQUIREMENTS.

00:18:33.011 --> 00:18:34.379
THE MEASURE WILL SIMPLY ENSURE

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:35.681
THAT CALIFORNIA ISN'T LAGGING

00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:37.082

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:39.318
THE ONLY LEGAL MEANS TO MODIFY

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:48.760
THIS MEASURE WOULD UPGRADE

CURRENT ANIMAL CRUELTY AND FOOD

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:53.365

INCLUDING CAGE FREE CONDITIONS.

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.473
IT WOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT VEAL

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:05.577

00:19:14.553 --> 00:19:15.954
THE INITIATIVE IS BACKED BY A

LARGE COALITION OF LEADING

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.875
ARE IN ALIGNMENT.

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:39.144
SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWO

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:39.845
THREE HUNDRED MAJOR FOOD

00:19:43.048 --> 00:19:44.416
PRACTICES.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:46.351
BUT ITS MOVEMENTS OF 90% OF THE

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:55.727
PERSPECTIVES.

00:19:55.794 --> 00:19:57.429
WE RECOGNIZE THE TRANSITION TO

CAGE FREE CANNOT SUDDENLY HAPPEN

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.500
AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO THE

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.334

RETAILERS CHOOSE AS THE DEADLINE

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:05.771
FOR THEIR COMMITMENTS.

00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:07.005
FARMERS NEED TO BUILD NEW

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:14.146
GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS

ON THE MARKET TO JUST AS WELL.

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:52.550

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:37.562
IS DETERMINED TO BE DEEP IN THE

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:38.930
MOST APPROPRIATE HOUSING

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:43.435
STANDARDS THAT'S INITIATIVE.

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.570
BUT IT'S THE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:26:45.637 --> 00:26:46.871
ON UNITED EGG PRODUCERS ANIMAL

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:47.939
HAS BEEN TO YOU HUSBANDRY

00:26:48.006 --> 00:26:49.774
GUIDELINES.

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:51.142
I JUST SORT I DON'T SEE THIS

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:52.544
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND MEANS

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.412
YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND I'M PAUL

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:55.347
FOR MAKING SURE THINGS ARE

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:56.014
HUMANE.

00:26:56.081 --> 00:26:57.882
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO GO BACK TO

00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:00.051
THE COST TO THEFARMER THE COST

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:01.853
TO THE ECONOMY THE COST TO MY

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.121
CONSUMERS.

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.789
AND I GOT TO I REALLY WORRY

00:27:04.856 --> 00:27:05.623
ABOUT MY CONSUMERS IF THERE'S

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.459
ANYTHING LOT OF MY PEOPLE ARE ON

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:09.394
LIMITED.

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:10.695
INCOME AND CHICKENS ONE OF THE

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:13.231
TOP --

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:15.066
PRODUCTS THAT THEY EAT.

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:16.468
AND SO THE EVERYTIME SOMETHING

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.936
GOES UP REFERENCES STATE

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:20.438
CALIFORNIA SO EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:21.673
THIS IS JUST ONE OF THEM.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.641
AND SURE BY CHRISTOPHER TALK

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.810
ABOUT COST YES YES SO THE

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:28.413
INITIATIVE ONLY COVERS ACTS THAT

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.081
I SHALL AND LIQUID ADS.

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:32.083
AND WOOD IS COMPANIES LIKE

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.952
MCDONALD'S AND WALMART MAKING

00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.353
THESE CONVERSIONS I REALLY

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.355
SPECIALIZE IN IN KEEPING PRICES

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.056
LOW.

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:39.724
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:43.595
DONE AND HEARD TOO HOT CONSUMERS

00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:46.231
WOULD BE AND THAT RANGES ABOUT

00:27:46.297 --> 00:27:47.565
ONE TO TWO SAM PER AG.

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:49.234
THAT CONSUMERS WOULD WOULD HAVE

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.636
THE IMPACT OF WHOM I'M THAT SO

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:53.171
HARD TO BELIEVE HER NEPHEW IN

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:54.372
AND BY.

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:55.173
THANKS RECENTLY BUT THEY'VE GONE

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.542
SKY HIGH.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:27:58.910
OKAY THANK YOU.

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:00.512
WELL IT'S NOT JUST IT'S IT'S IN

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:02.447
COMPARISON TO STATES THAT DON'T

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:03.448
HAVE THE SAME.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.383
REGULATIONS THAT THERE THE

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.586
DIFFERENCES FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT.

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:11.089
MR MATHIS ARM.

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.525
YEAH I MEAN IT.

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:17.228
HOW MANY MORE PHASES YEARS HAVE?

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:18.129
BUT AGAIN DOESN'T IT ASSEMBLY

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:19.664
MEMBER MATHIS THIS I CAN ONLY BE

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.433
CHANGED BY THE VOTERS TIME SO

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:23.701
YOU KNOW IT THE I UNDERSTAND IT

00:28:23.768 --> 00:28:25.637
DOESN'T TAKE INTO THAT VOTERS AS

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.472
AND THAT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:28.039
THAT SLOWS THE PROCESS ISSUE

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:28.873
NUMBER.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.041
I'M SORRY YOU SAID YOU HAVE A

00:28:30.108 --> 00:28:32.744
PLAN TO TO FEES AND SO WHAT IS

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.679
YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL.

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:35.647
BUT WE START WITH HIS YOU WOULD

00:28:35.713 --> 00:28:37.582
HAVE WROTE THIS AND TO PROP TO

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.184
YOU WHEN YOU DIDN'T BECAUSE YOU

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.718
WANTED TO MOVE BACK OR MENTALLY.

00:28:40.785 --> 00:28:43.254
AND E. E. OF COST INDUSTRY IN

00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:45.323
CALIFORNIA THOUGH OVER TWO

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.091
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:48.259
YOU'VE INCREASE THE COST OF EGGS.

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:51.629
WAIT WHICH HAS A NET INCREASE ON

00:28:51.696 --> 00:28:53.298
OTHER STATE BUDGETS NOT NOT AS

00:28:53.364 --> 00:28:54.699
FOOD AND AG BUT I MEAN YOU ALSO

00:28:54.766 --> 00:28:57.702
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.337
THE YOU KNOW OUR OUR PROGRAMS

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:01.673
LIKE WAKING CAL FRESH GIVE ACHES

00:29:01.739 --> 00:29:03.308
TO FAMILIES WHO ARE IN NEED.

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:05.944
WHICH IS THEN ANOTHER INCURRED.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:06.945
ARE BUDGETARY [inaudible]

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:09.047
THAT -- CAN

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:09.881
YOU KNOW FOR THE STATE WE HAVE

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.583
TO EAT THAT COST.

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:13.952
AND SO I MEAN IF IT IS THE LA O.

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:15.186
I I SHOULD ASK THIS QUESTION OF

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.654
THE LA A A LA OR DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.923
NUMBERS ON THE INCREASED COSTS

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.925
FOR THAT THE WAKE PROGRAMS OR

00:29:20.992 --> 00:29:22.994
CAL FRESH --

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:24.462
IN IN NUMBERS ON HOW MANY

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.397
FAMILIES ARE GETTING EGGS AND

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:27.031
THE INCREASED COST OF THE STATE

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.366
THERE.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:29.834
AS SOMEONE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:30.668
OFFICE IDON'T HAVE THAT

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.970
INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO BE

00:29:32.036 --> 00:29:36.774
RIGHT NOW TO SHARE WITH YOU --

00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:39.043
I KNOW THAT THEY THAT INCLUDED

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.579
IN THE MEASURE THERE IS ADD A

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:44.616
PROVISION THAT THAT AS I AS I

00:29:44.682 --> 00:29:45.717
UNDERSTAND IT.

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:47.218
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE

00:29:47.285 --> 00:29:48.419
MEASURE --

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:51.723
SUPERSEDES THAT THE REQUIREMENTS

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:52.957
ON IS IT THIS.

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.959
THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION.

00:29:55.026 --> 00:29:57.762
I'VE PROGRAM BUT AS FOR HOW MUCH

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:59.063
TO TIP ATTENTION THE INCREASED

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.598
COSTS FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.766
JUST NAMED I DON'T HAVE AN

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:04.469
ESTIMATE. FOR A I ASK THAT

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:05.537
BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WE YOU

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:07.305
KNOW FIFTY SIX FOR SOME OF MY

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:09.174
DISTRICT IS ON SOME KIND OF US

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.375
LEGISLATOR MEDIC CALLERS

00:30:10.441 --> 00:30:13.645
pAND YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE INCOME

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:14.245
IS UNDER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:30:14.312 --> 00:30:15.146
HERE.

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:17.115
SELL IT IS WE GO TO INCREASE

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:18.449
THESE THINGS AND WE'RE HAVING A

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.918
HARD ENOUGH TIME.

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.786
ENSURING THAT FAMILIES CAN

00:30:21.853 --> 00:30:23.721
LITERALLY FEED THEIR FAMILIES --

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:24.856
VERSUS HAVING TO MAKE OTHER

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:26.291
CHOICES ON YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GAS

00:30:26.357 --> 00:30:27.759
TO PUT IN THEIR TANK.

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.094
AND SO WE YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:32.931
WITH WITH ANOTHER PHASE --

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.299
THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:34.999
WRITTEN BEFORE.

00:30:35.066 --> 00:30:37.368
ARM.

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:39.704
I I JUST HAVE A HARD TIME.

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.072
SEEN HOW FAMILIES CAN --

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.941
DIGEST --

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:45.109
ALL THESE INCREASES.

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:47.078
SO A SUMMER MATHIS MAYBE I CAN --

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.280
DE UM ELABORATE ON THAT IN IN I

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:50.782
THINK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:51.816
THERE WAS MUCH MORE DISAGREEMENT

00:30:51.883 --> 00:30:53.451
TWEEN ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS AND

00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:54.786
AND AGRICULTURE.

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:57.155
INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF THE PROPER

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:57.522
OR YOU KNOW --

00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:00.258
THE INDIA CONFINEMENT STANDARDS

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:01.659
FOR FOR ANIMALS WE'VE MOVED TO A

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:02.860
POINT NOW WHERE IN THE

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:03.761
INITIATIVE [inaudible]

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:05.363
WE ADOPT.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.198
THE UNITED EGG PRODUCERS ANIMAL

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:09.567
HUSBANDRY GUIDELINES SO I THINK

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:10.568
WE'VE REACHED A POINT IN THAT

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:12.203
SORT OF IN THIS PHASE IN A

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.605
PROCESS THAT ACTUALLY AGREEMENT

00:31:13.671 --> 00:31:15.573
BETWEEN ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.809
AND PRODUCERS --

00:31:17.875 --> 00:31:20.044
OF WHAT THE PROPER STANDARDS ARE

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.145
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S OF

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.080
BUT THAT'S A GREAT DEVELOPMENT

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:24.449
FRANKLY BUT BUT BUT AS AS YOU

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:26.150
JUST TESTIFIED.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.952
THE MARKETS ARE YOU DOING THIS

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.120
YOU JUST SAID COSCO'S ALREADY

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:31.489
ADOPTING THIS SO OF THE MARKET'S

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:34.292
RD DOING IT ON OUR OWN WHAT'S

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.160
THE NEED FOR A MEASURE. TO

00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.495
ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO OUT

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:38.363
LETTERS IN THE MARKET.

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:39.931
EXCUSE ME THAT ALL ANIMALS HAVE

00:31:39.998 --> 00:31:44.502
THE PROPER PROTECTIONS.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.237
SO WE'RE MORE CONCERNED BUT THE

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:47.839
OTHER THING IS TO SET A DATE.

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:49.707
RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT IT DOES

00:31:49.774 --> 00:31:50.875
IS IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE DATE

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:54.279
AND I THINK IT SAM.

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:54.846
IT SIGNIFICANT THAT THERE'S

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:55.913
AGREEMENT.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.649
MY CONCERN IN AND WE'LL HEAR

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.050
FROM THE OPPOSITION --

00:31:59.117 --> 00:32:01.152
IT'S JUST WHETHER THE DATE WORKS --

00:32:01.219 --> 00:32:03.354
I'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.622
ACTORS ALL OF THE STATE OF

00:32:04.689 --> 00:32:06.024
CALIFORNIA AND I'VE HAD AN

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.625
OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT FARMS.

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:09.460
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:32:09.527 --> 00:32:12.230
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT GETTING. TO

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:13.965
THIS NEW STANDARD THE QUESTION

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.934
IS AMORTIZING THE COST OVERTIME

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:18.736
AND THEN GETTING ENOUGH.

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.271
HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO ACTUALLY

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:21.973
MOVE THE EQUIPMENT OUT BRING IN

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.940
NEW AND HAVE IT LINE UP WITH

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:26.344
WHEN -- WHEN

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:28.046
THAT THEIR HANDS ARE PRODUCING?

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:30.715
FROM THE HAND PERSPECTIVE SO --

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:32.216
MINIMUM PORTENT PART THAT I HEAR

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.851
FROM FARMERS WHO ARE LOOKING TO

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.119
MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:35.720
THEY KNOW THE WRITING'S ON THE

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:36.954
WALL.

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.057
PROP TO LIZ THIRTEEN YOU KNOW

00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:40.591
YEARS AGO THAT THIS WAS THAT THE

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:42.026
IDEA WAS ADOPTED.

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:43.761
AND GOING BACK TO WHAT I SAID

00:32:43.828 --> 00:32:45.630
ABOUT PROVIDING CERTAINTY BEINGS

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:47.165
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY

00:32:47.231 --> 00:32:48.800
ALSO HAVE.

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:50.368
YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE MAKING THE

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:51.803
RIGHT INVESTMENTS THESE FARMERS

00:32:51.869 --> 00:32:53.538
AND LOANING MONEY AND THAT

00:32:53.604 --> 00:32:54.072
THEY'RE LOANING MONEY TO

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.106
SOMETHING.

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:56.474
THAT IS GOING TO BE BOUGHT BY

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.042
CONSUMERS AND IT IS GOING TO BE

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:15.980
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE HAS

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:18.048
BEEN THE TARGET DATE.

00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:18.749

THREE YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:23.954
THREE YEARS MAY SEEM

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:25.589
INSIGNIFICANT TO MOST PEOPLE BUT

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.825
THE TIME NECESSARY TO BUILD

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:29.426
BARNS IN THIS STATE.

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:29.894

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.510
THE MAJOR PROBLEM HERE.

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:48.546
IS THE TIMELINE.

00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:49.780
A STAFF ASSOCIATION OF

00:40:49.847 --> 00:40:51.482
CALIFORNIA EGG FARMERS ARE

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:53.450
FAMILY FARMERS THAT HAVE FED

CALIFORNIANS FOR GENERATIONS.

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.921

STATE IN THE NATION IS AGAIN

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.990
BEING SYSTEMATICALLY WHITTLE

00:41:00.057 --> 00:41:02.026
DOWN THROUGH A BILL DESIGNED

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.260
INITIATIVES LIKE THIS.

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.628

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:16.073
CHALLENGED CALIFORNIA FAMILIES.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.708
THE RESPONSIBLE COURSE OF ACTION

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:19.043
WOULD BE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT MAJOR

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:20.711
RETAILERS AND CONSUMER TRENDS

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.146

00:41:22.213 --> 00:41:25.015
FOR USE A TWO TWENTY FIVE DATE.

00:41:25.082 --> 00:41:26.317
STOP FORCING MORE ECONOMIC

VOCAL GROUP HAS MISINFORMED

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.921
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT TRULY

00:41:30.988 --> 00:41:32.723
UNDERSTAND ALL THE ISSUES.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.292
HOW MUCH WILL THIS COST?

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.360
THE LOWEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS

AGAIN BEFORE WE SEE THE REAL.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.765
PROBLEM HERE.

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:43.000
OKAY IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD

PRODUCE OUR OWN FOOD.

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:47.271
FINISH OF A NEGATIVE LIKE THIS

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:50.274
WOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED.%

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:52.710
THE REALITY IS MUCH DIFFERENT.

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:53.544
FORTY MILLION HUNGRY

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.346

HARD EARNED DOLLAR.

00:41:58.749 --> 00:41:59.750
THIS INITIATIVE WILL INCREASE

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.518

OTHER STATES TAX REVENUE WILL BE

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:11.095

INTO VEAL CRATE.

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:21.678
YOU COULD SEE A PICTURE OF A

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.647
PAGAN AGES STATION CRAIG.

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:25.649
YOU CAN SEE THE OF THE REALLY

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.317
COMPELLING PHOTOS.

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:28.752
THAT JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.487
TAKEN OUT OF STATE.

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.890
MANY YEARS AGO WERE THE SAME

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:35.192
IMAGES THAT THEY USEWHILE

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:36.960
PROMOTING PROPOSITION.

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.262
TWO AND NONE OF THESE PRACTICES

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:40.531
EXIST IN OUR STATE.

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:42.266
THEIR WORD VEAL CRATES IN

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:46.303
CALIFORNIA AT THE TIME OF PROP.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:47.738
TWO THERE ARE NO WE JUST STATION

00:46:47.804 --> 00:46:49.840
CRATES IN CALIFORNIA NOW AND

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:51.875
HAVEN'T BEEN FOR YEARS BUT THEY

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:53.477
HAVE GOTTEN PEOPLE TO SIGN THAT

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:55.412
PETITION BASED ON THE CLAIM THAT

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:57.247
THEY WILL BE PREVENTING THESE

00:46:57.314 --> 00:46:58.015
PRACTICES.

00:46:58.081 --> 00:47:01.618
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.686
THEY WERE IVEN A DIRECT

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:06.456
QUESTION AS TO WHY PROPOSITION

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:09.426
TWO IF IF IT WAS TO BAN CAGES.

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:12.062
WHY DIDN'T IT SAY THIS BANDS

00:47:12.129 --> 00:47:13.931
CAGES?

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:15.899
AND THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION AND

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:19.136
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:21.838
IT'S NOT LIKE WELL WAY BACK IN

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.006
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT OO IN

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.741
THOSE DAYS WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:27.077
IF YOU WANNA BAN CAGES YOU HAVE

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:28.212
TO SAY IN THE TEXT OF THE

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:29.179
LEGISLATION.

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:32.583
CAGES.

00:47:32.649 --> 00:47:35.552
THEY WE KNEW IN TWO THOUSAND AND

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:38.088
EIGHT IF YOU WANNA GIVE A HAND

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:38.622
TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN SQUARE

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:42.159
INCHES OR MORE OF CAGE SPACE OR

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:43.393
LIVING SPACE THAT YOU.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.996
PUT THAT INTO THE LEGISLATION

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.397
YOU PUT THAT INTO THE INITIATIVE.

00:47:47.464 --> 00:47:49.266
THEY MADE THE CONSCIOUS CHOICE

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:51.034
NOT TO DO THAT THEY MADE THE

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:53.036
CONSCIOUS CHOICE OF PUTTING IN

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:55.038
VERY VAGUE LANGUAGE.

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:57.407
SO THEY DEPENDING ON WHAT

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:59.076
AUDIENCE THEY WERE.

00:47:59.142 --> 00:48:01.144
SELLINGTHIS TO DATE COULD CRAFT

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.613
THEIR ARGUMENT ACCORDINGLY YOU

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:04.081
DON'T WANT CAGES WELL THIS

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:05.382
DOESN'T SAY CAGES YOU WANT A PET

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:08.051
CAGE AS WELL THIS IS A DE FACTO

00:48:08.118 --> 00:48:09.152
BAN ON CAGES.

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:10.887
CALIFORNIA VOTERS WENT TO THE

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:12.689
POLLS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.291
OVERWHELMINGLY VOTED FOR

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.193
SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE TOLD.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.795
BY BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE BY H.

00:48:18.862 --> 00:48:20.931
AS U. S. AND BY THE INDUSTRY

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:22.599
ITSELF THAT IF THIS MEASURE

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:23.900
PASSES.

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.702
CAGES WOULD BE BANNED BY TWO

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:26.970
THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND THEY

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:28.438
WOULD BE GETTING NO LESS A TWO

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:29.373
HUNDRED SQUARE INCHES

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:29.673
[inaudible]

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.642
HER HAND.

00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:34.344
NO AES U. S. IS COME HERE TODAY

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.979
TO TALK ABOUT THE EGG INDUSTRIES.

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:38.582
DISINGENUOUS MISINTERPRETATION

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:40.617
OF PROPOSITION.

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:43.387
TWO WE ARE ONE OF THE BOTH

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:44.955
FERVENT ADVERSARIES OF THE AG

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:46.790
INDUSTRY.

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:50.060
UNLIKE H. AS U. S. WE HAVE NOT

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:51.228
ENDORSED THIS GENTLEMAN'S

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:52.562
FACILITY.

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:53.997
WE DID NOT HOLD THIS GENTLEMAN'S

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.932
FACILITY UP AS A MODEL FOR THE

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:58.969
NATION LIKE H. AS U. S. DID.

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:00.137
NOW THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT TODAY

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:01.438
BECAUSE THEY'RE FLIP FLOPPING

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.206
BACK AND FORTH DEPENDING ON THE

00:49:03.273 --> 00:49:07.044
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.845
BUT WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENT IN

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.280
SAYING THAT IT'S THE VOTER

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.783
INTENT THAT MATTERS HERE.

00:49:12.849 --> 00:49:14.518
AND THERE'S NO DEBATE THAT THE

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.086
VOTER INTENT WAS THAT THERE TO

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.854
BE A DEADLINE TO TWO THOUSAND

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:19.823
AND FIFTEEN THE DISINGENUOUS

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.358
MISINTERPRETED HER PETITION

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:22.626
REINTERPRETATION.

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:25.929
IS FOR THE SPONSORS OF PROP.

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:27.731
TWO COULD NOT OWN UP TO THEIR

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.166
MISTAKE.

00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:31.001
A ASSEMBLYMAN LEVINE ASKS WHY

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.035
CAN'T WE SETTLE THIS

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.438
LEGISLATIVELY.

00:49:34.504 --> 00:49:36.540
THE ANSWER IS THEY'RE NOT THE

00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:38.308
DIFFERENCE ISN'T SIMPLY THAT

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.409
THEY WILL WANT TO KEEP THEM IN

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.478
CAGES TWENTY FOUR MONTHS LONGER

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.779
THAN AGES U. S. WANTS TO KEEP

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:44.614
THEM IN CAGES IT'S NOT SIMPLY

00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:46.583
THAT THEY WANT TO MEAN CAGES FOR

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.085
NINE YEARS AFTER PROPOSITION TWO

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:48.719
WAS SUPPOSED TO GO.

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:49.920
INTO EFFECT AN AGE ISSUE WHAT'S

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:55.125
IN YEARS AFTER THAT.

00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.561
WITH THE LEGISLATION IT BECOMES

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:58.061
CLEAR.

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:58.895
IF.

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:00.831
IF IF THEY HAD BEEN CORRECT

00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:01.565
ABOUT.

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:05.001
WHAT PROPOSITION TWO SAID WE

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.603
WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY?

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.105
IF THEY WERE TELLING THE TRUTH

00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:08.972
ABOUT THEIR PRESENT ROTTEN

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.974
INITIATIVE.

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.275
WE WOULD BE AMONG THE FIRST TO

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:14.544
SUPPORT IT.

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:18.215
pBELIEVE THAT THIS AND VOTERS

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.816
HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN CALIFORNIANS

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:22.686
HAVE ALREADY FOLKS SPOKANE.

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:23.754
AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:24.921
CALIFORNIA'S BALLOT MEASURE

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:26.857
SYSTEM.

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:28.558
SHOULD BE EXPLOITED [inaudible]

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.127
BY.

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:31.962
ANIMAL THEMED CORPORATIONS FROM

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:34.498
THE EAST COAST THAT EVERY

00:50:34.564 --> 00:50:37.134
SEVERAL YEARS OR SO FLYING INTO

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.170
CALIFORNIA.

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:41.838
AND TELL CALIFORNIANS HOW WE

00:50:41.905 --> 00:50:43.740
SHOULD REGULATE AT FARM ANIMALS

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.142
NOTIN OUR STATE ONLY IN OUR

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:45.642
STATE.

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.511
BUT IN OTHER STATES.

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:49.780
WE BASICALLY HAVE PEOPLE FROM

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:51.248
MARILYN.

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:54.117
FLYING TO CALIFORNIA TO TELL

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.987
CALIFORNIA'S CALIFORNIANS THAT

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:59.289
THEY SHOULD REGULATE IOWA.

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:00.991
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AND

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.559
THE REASON WHY THEY ARE NOT ON

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:04.661
BOARD WITH THE A. B. THIRTY

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.530
TWENTY ONE WHICH WE'D.

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:08.665
OPENLY OPPOSE WE'RE OPPOSED TO

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:09.733
IT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE CAGE

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.102
FREE NOW WE THINK THAT ONE

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.837
SQUARE FOOT PER HAND IS INSANELY

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:17.274
COOL.

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.508
BUT THE REASON WHY THEY ARE

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.277
DOING IT IS BECAUSE THE

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:22.746
LEGISLATION IS CLEAR.

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.214
THE LEGISLATION WHAT YOU SEE IS

00:51:24.281 --> 00:51:26.883
WHAT YOU GET IT SAYS HERE'S

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.920
CAGES THEIR LEGAL UNTIL THIS DY.

00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:30.954
CARES MUCH HOW MUCH SPACE YOU'RE

00:51:31.021 --> 00:51:32.055
GOING TO GET.

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:34.391
THE REASON WHY EACH ISSUE S.

00:51:34.458 --> 00:51:36.359
FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:37.227
UNDER.

00:51:37.294 --> 00:51:38.361
THE ENDORSING THAT.

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.362
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ENDORSING

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:43.266
THE EXACT SAME POLICY THE EXACT

00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:45.735
SAME KATE SIZE.

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:47.037
IN THE INITIATIVE.

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.872
IS THAT ANY INITIATIVE IT'S

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.173
BURIED IN A BUNCH OF OTHER

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.741
GARBAGE.

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:53.343
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO ADMIT THAT

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.847
PROP TWO FAILED.

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:58.315
THEY CAN ACTED TODAY.

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.750
AT THIS GENTLEMAN HERE SAID WELL

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:02.319
THE REASON WHY WE DIDN'T --

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:04.254
SAY CAGE FREE EXPLICITLY

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:06.056
IMPROPER TO ONLY EVERY SINGLE

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:08.024
PIECE OF PROPAGANDA SAID IT THE

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.793
REASON WHY WE DIDN'T SAY IT IS

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.864
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO PHASE IT IN.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.733
THAT IS COMPLETE DOUBLE TALK.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.502
THAT'S COMPLETE DOUBLE TALK.

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:21.037
PROPOSITION TWO WAS A PHASE IN.

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.073
PROPOSITION TO A TWO THOUSAND

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.841
AND EIGHT SAID WE'RE GOING TO

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:28.144
GIVE THE EGG INDUSTRY SIX YEARS.

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:30.447
TO PROVIDE MORE ADVOCATES SPACE

00:52:30.514 --> 00:52:32.916
AND EVENTUALLY IN THE YEAR TWO

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:34.651
THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN BE CAGE

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:36.453
FREE.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.622
THAT IS A PHASE IN THAT IS A

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.623
PHASE IN THAT MANY ANIMAL

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:40.590
ORGANIZATIONS WERE NOT

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:42.225
COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:43.627
THEY THOUGHT SIX YEARS WAS TOO

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:45.362
LONG WE THOUGHT SIX YEARS WAS

00:52:45.428 --> 00:52:46.997
TOO LONG.

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:49.132
HOWEVER WHEN SIX YEARS CAME

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:50.233
ALONG.

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:51.902
LO AND BEHOLD THE HANDS ARE

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:53.637
STILL IN CAGES.

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:56.373
H. AS YOU S. WAS TOLD PRIOR TO

00:52:56.439 --> 00:52:57.874
SUBMITTING THEIR BAD THERE BUT

00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:59.242
THEIR BALLOT MEASURE LANGUAGE

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:01.044
THAT EXACTLY THIS WAS GOING TO

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:03.480
TAKE PLACE.

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:04.948
BUT THEY SPEND THE LAST TEN

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.116
YEARS.

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:07.951
RAISING MONEY.

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.286
AND MAKING HEROES OUT OF THERE

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:11.755
NOW.

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:14.791
DISGRACED FORMER SEE EGO WHO IS

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.927
NOT HERE TO ANSWER VICTIM DO

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:18.895
REAL QUESTIONS.

00:53:18.962 --> 00:53:20.730
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ABOUT THE

00:53:20.797 --> 00:53:23.633
FRAUD THAT IS TAKING PLACE HERE.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.002
HE'S NO LONGER IN THE PICTURE.

00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:28.104
SO WE'VE GOT HAT THE NEW REGIME

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.105
COMING IN TRYING TO PICK UP THE

00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:32.609
PIECES.

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:34.444
BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:35.445
TO TOUCH ON IS THE LEGISLATIVE

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:36.346
ANALYST'S WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:37.647
THE COSTS.

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.848
THEY HAVEN'T YET FACTORED IN THE

00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:39.983
COST [inaudible]

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.320
SENDING THIS PLAYING IN COURT

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.220
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS

00:53:44.287 --> 00:53:45.655
ALREADY SPENT.

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:46.623
A TRUCKLOAD OF MONEY --

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.224
IS.

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:49.426
DEFENDING THE LAWS THAT ARE ON

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:50.760
THE BOOKS [inaudible]

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:54.764
THIS IS I HAM FISTED OVER REACH.

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:56.066
THAT IS ALREADY CAUSING

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:57.934
TREMENDOUS BLOW BACK BOTH IN

00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:00.003
CONGRESS.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:01.638
AND IN THE COURTS.

00:54:01.705 --> 00:54:03.607
AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD.

00:54:03.673 --> 00:54:05.208
NONE OF THESE PROVISIONS FOR

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:06.610
THOSE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ROOM

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:07.811
THE RISING COSTS OF PORK DON'T

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:09.946
WORRY.

00:54:10.013 --> 00:54:11.414
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS GOING

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:13.483
TO BE RENDERED NULL AND VOID.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:14.117
IT'S GONNA COME OFF AFTER A LOT

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.319
OF COSTS.

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.354
IT'S GOING TO CUT BY AFTER MANY

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.089
MILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS IT'S

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:21.124
GOING TO COME AFTER A DOLLARS

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:22.459
FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT COULD

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:23.393
HAVE BEEN USED TO IMPROVE

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.495
CONDITIONS IT'S GONNA COME FROM

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:26.930
MONEY FROM THE HUMANE COMMUNITY.

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.698
THAT COULD BE USING THAT MONEY

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:31.001
TO ACTUALLY HELP ANIMALS.

00:54:31.067 --> 00:54:33.203
IF EACH ISSUE S. REALLY KICK ALL

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.437
OF THE OTHER ARGUMENT AGAINST

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.006
THE LEGISLATION THAT TEACHERS U.

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:38.208
S. WILL SAY IS THAT WELL THE

00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:39.275
LEGISLATION.

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.844
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.512
THOSE POOR CAPS IN CRATES WHO

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:44.848
CAN'T TURN AROUND.

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:47.183
IF H. AS U. S. CARED ABOUT CAPS

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.785
IN CRATES.

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.820
WHO CAN'T TURN AROUND THEY NEED

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:52.889
NOT GO NO FURTHER?

00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.692
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.261
WE HAVE COULD A CALF FARMS IN

00:54:58.328 --> 00:55:00.330
CALIFORNIA WEIRD CAPS ARE

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:02.132
TETHERED IN CRATES.

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:04.234
VERY SIMILAR TO VEAL CRATES

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:04.834
WHERE THEY ARE UNABLE TO TURN

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.971
AROUND. EIGHT YEARS YOU S. HEADS

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:10.440
EXPLICITLY SAID NO THEY REFUSE

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:12.175
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT.

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:13.777
CALIFORNIA ANIMALS.

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:16.479
INSTEAD THEY'RE SAYING.

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.947
WE'RE GOING TO LET THE CAPS IN

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.783
CALIFORNIA SCHEME CRATES BUT WE

00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:21.451
WANT TO PASS AN INITIATIVE

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:22.585
THAT'S GOING TO TELL.

00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:24.554
PENNSYLVANIA VEAL PRODUCERS THAT

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:25.255
YOU SHOULDN'T KEEP THEM IN

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.956
CRATES THERE OKAY HERE FOR

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:29.059
CALIFORNIA BUT WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.894
REGULATE YOU IN WISCONSIN.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.762
AND THAT'S ABSURD.

00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:34.631
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ABSURD IT'S

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.566
DISINGENUOUS THEY KNOW THAT IS

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:39.135
IT ISN'T GOING TO FLY.

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:41.237
AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.338
SIMPLY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.973
RENDERED NULL AND VOID.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.742
THE PROBLEM IS THE DAMAGE THAT

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.577
IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON A WIDE

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:50.080
ARRAY OF OTHER CONSUMER.

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:52.148
ANIMAL.

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:53.750
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.452
BECAUSE WHEN THE COURTS AND

00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:58.455
CONGRESS COME BACK AND WE GOT

00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.956
THIS THING THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:01.691
USE A SCALPEL.

00:56:01.758 --> 00:56:03.259
THEY'RE GOING TO USE A CANNON.

00:56:03.326 --> 00:56:04.661
AND THAT CAN IN IS GOING TO

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:07.197
DESTROY A LOT OF LEGISLATION

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.099
THAT ALL OF US HAVE WORKED ON

00:56:09.165 --> 00:56:10.967
OVER THE YEARS.

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.035
IT'S GOING TO DESTROY

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:13.903
LEGISLATION THAT FRANKLY IS

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:15.605
PROTECTING THE CALIFORNIA EGG

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.440
PRODUCERS IN SOME WAY IN IN MANY

00:56:17.507 --> 00:56:19.576
WAYS ALL OF THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:21.478
RENDERED NULL AND VOID.

00:56:21.544 --> 00:56:24.380
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO CONCERNED.

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:26.116
WE HAVE LOADING THIS UP WITH

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.585
DISTRACTIONS.

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.353
THIS IS A PUBLICITY STUNT IN

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.022
SEARCH OF A LAWSUIT.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.290
AND FOR THEM THEY'RE LOOKING FOR

00:56:34.357 --> 00:56:35.458
THE QUICK IMMEDIATE

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:37.260
GRATIFICATION THEY FEEL LIKE

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.528
ANYTHING THAT HAS THE WORD FARM

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:40.797
ANIMAL AND PROTECT.

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:41.598
IF IT HAS THOSE WORDS AND YOU

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:42.665
PUT IT ON THE BALLOT IT'S GOING

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.467
TO PASS.

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.669
AND PERHAPS THEY'RE RIGHT.

00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:48.605
BUT THIS TIME AROUND.

00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:51.441
IT'S GONNA FACE MAJOR OPPOSITION.

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:53.309
I DON'T SEE THE MAJOR OPPOSITION

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:54.410
COMING FROM.

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:57.647
WISCONSIN PORK PRODUCERS ARE OR

00:56:57.714 --> 00:56:59.149
VIA PORTS PRODUCERS.

ANIMALS RESPECT AND KINDNESS ITS

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.325
ACTION FOR ANIMALS IT'S OF THE

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.494
VAST MAJORITY OF RANK AND FILE

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.830
ANIMAL ACTIVE ADVOCATES THAT ARE

APPALLED BY THIS RUN NAY

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.800
INITIATIVE.

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:18.134
AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE WAGING

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.804
THIS.

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.338
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

DRESSES MATHIS --

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:32.215
PERVERSE TO ONE EIGHT JOHN FOR

00:57:32.282 --> 00:57:33.283
TAKING THE TIME I GOT TO RESPECT

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:34.684
THE MAN THAT'S GOT A LITTLE DUST

SO WHO'S ACTUALLY DOING IT --

00:57:39.088 --> 00:57:41.124
MISTER MILLER A I THINK YOUR

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:43.827
POINTS ARE SPOT ON THE AYE AYE

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:46.663

00:57:52.669 --> 00:57:53.837
AGRICULTURAL.

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:56.973
ISSUES IN THE THE IDEA OF

AND WOMEN AND OTHER STATES WOULD

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:07.050
FIND PREPOSTEROUS.

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:07.684
AND I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON TO

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.319
SAY THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND THE

00:58:09.385 --> 00:58:10.486
MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:12.889

00:58:28.404 --> 00:58:37.614
INITIATIVE PRESCRIBE BEING A

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.147
FASTER <u>&lt;c.green&gt; I OUR PROCESS.&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:38.815

PRODUCING BUSINESSES IN

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.409
CALIFORNIA WOULD LEAVE THE STATE.

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:08.912
ARE THERE ANY ESTIMATES OF AS TO

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:11.047

AND WITHOUT WE ALSO LOST THAT'S

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:38.541

REGARDING ANIMAL CARE AND

MADE BY THOSE WHO HAVE THE

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.568

OF STATE ANIMAL ACTIVIST GROUPS

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.508
WITH A CERTAIN HIDDEN AGENDA.

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.009
THERE'S ACTUALLY NO SCIENTIFIC

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.477
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:22.845
INITIATIVE AND THERE'S NO

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:25.114
BENEFIT TO IT FOR CALIFORNIA OR

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.283
ITS CITIZENS IT WILL INCREASE

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.852
FOOD PRICES WITHOUT A DOUBT.

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:31.454
THE MAJORITY OF PORK PRODUCTS

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.655
THAT ARE IMPORTED INTO

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:34.557
CALIFORNIA WHERE THE MAJORITY OF

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:35.858
PORK PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:38.294
ARE IMPORTED FROM STATES WHERE

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.862
PRODUCERS DO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.497
WITH THIS LEGISLATION.

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.999
IOWA ILLINOIS AND A VARIETY OF

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.700
OTHER STATES.

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.436
AS A RESULT AS WE KNOW AND HAS

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.838
BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY CHANGES

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.073
IN PRODUCTION PRACTICES COME AT

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.874
A SIGNIFICANT COST AND THOSE

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.309
WILL BE PASSED ON DIRECTLY TO

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.243
CONSUMERS.

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:56.312
THROUGH HIGHER RETAIL PRICES LOW

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.281
INCOME IN LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.816
ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:00.817
HIGHER LIVING COSTS IN

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:02.251
CALIFORNIA.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.786
THE ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS VERY

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.221
QUICKLY THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:08.091
MINNESOTA STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND

01:02:08.157 --> 01:02:09.258
FIFTEEN HAS SHOWN THAT RETAIL

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.260
EGG PRICES HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.929
SINCE THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN

01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:14.430
LAW HAVE INCREASED SEVENTY

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.566
DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD.

01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:18.000
A CORNELL STUDY.

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:19.902
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:21.604
AGAIN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.306
HAS NOTED THAT FOR RETAIL PORT

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.575
PURCHASES CONSUMER SPEND TWO

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:28.377
POINT TWO MORE PER CAPITA IN

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:29.846
THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PORK.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:31.314
SO IF YOU DO THE MATH THAT'S

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.548
OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.917
DOLLARS MORE PER HOUSEHOLD WILL

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.519
BE SPENDING ON PORK IF THIS

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.154
INITIATIVE PASSES.

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.889
IF IT IS A TAXPAYER FUNDED

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:42.258
PROGRAM SUCH AS WHERE OR SNAP OR

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.494
ANY INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING THOSE

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.062
COSTS WILL ALSO.

01:02:46.129 --> 01:02:48.030
TRANSPIREIN THAT SO TO SAY

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.899
THERE ARE NOT ANY DIRECT IMPACTS

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.601
ON COST TO CONSUMERS IS

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.269
INCORRECT THERE WILL BE AND THAT

01:02:53.336 --> 01:02:54.470
IS THE ISSUE.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.205
AND FINALLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.874
THAT WE DO BELIEVE THE

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.475
CALIFORNIA PORK PRODUCERS DO

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:00.643
BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.578
INCREASES AND GROWTH IN OUR

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.113
INDUSTRY IF IT WERE NOT FOR

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:04.747
