DATE THAT CAN BE HELPFUL IN

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:04.118
LEADING TO WHAT IS DONE AS YOU

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.419

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:08.289
ACTUALLY- AGENTS KNOCKING ON

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:10.591
SOMEONE'S DOOR- AN INDIVIDUAL

WHO HAS- A WEAPONS THAT THEY

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:15.396
SHOULDN'T HAVE UNDER THE LAW.

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:15.963
THE SECOND ISSUE IS WE HAVE

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:18.265

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:37:22.436 --> 01:37:24.338

EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY- AND

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:32.546
THEN I'M OPEN TO OTHER IDEAS

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:33.447
FOR HOW WE CAN WORK ON IT

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.082
TOGETHER. I ONE OF THE THINGS

THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:37.218
IMPORTANT WOULD BE TO HAVE.

01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:39.320
PERHAPS A LEGISLATIVE DOJ

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:41.288
WORKING GROUP. HOWEVER WE WORK

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:42.356
ON THIS TOGETHER WE CAN GIVE

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:43.390
UPDATES ON WHAT WE'RE DOING WE

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.625

DIFFERENTLY WE FAIL TO DO IT

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.208

THIS BODY LAST YEAR STARTED THE

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:42.709

CARRY THE BADGE AFTER CERTAIN

01:54:49.148 --> 01:54:50.049
ACTIONS AND I THINK IT'S A

01:54:50.116 --> 01:54:51.484
REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:52.952
AND ONE THAT IS ON GOING IS YOU

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:54.921

01:55:01.861 --> 01:55:03.496
SB TWO PROPOSES THAT THE

SIT IN POST. AND I THINK THAT'S-

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:10.637
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THAT

01:55:10.703 --> 01:55:12.372
I HAVE FOR YOU AND IT'S AN OPEN

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:14.707
QUESTION FOR ME IS THAT MY GUT

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:15.842
TELLS ME THE BEST PLACE FOR

01:55:15.908 --> 01:55:16.843
THAT PROCESS DEPARTMENT OF

01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:19.479
JUSTICE IS NOT A POLICE OFFICER

01:55:19.545 --> 01:55:21.881
STANDARDS AND TRAINING- AND I

JUST WONDERED WHAT YOUR

01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:23.983
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT IS AND

01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.817
WHETHER YOU WOULD BE A PARTNER

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:26.019
IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION

01:55:26.085 --> 01:55:27.954
ABOUT WEIRD BASS THE

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:28.554
DECERTIFICATION PROCESS SHOULD

01:55:28.621 --> 01:55:31.324
SET. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:33.726
QUESTION THE- CONTACT WITH THE

01:55:33.793 --> 01:55:37.030
CERTIFICATION IS ONE I'VE- AS A

01:55:37.096 --> 01:55:38.031
LEGISLATOR I'VE BEEN DIRECTLY

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:42.902
INVOLVED IN- CO AUTHOR OF SB.

01:55:42.969 --> 01:55:43.870
TWO CALIFORNIA TAX OFTEN ABOUT

01:55:43.936 --> 01:55:47.607
HOW WE LEAD WERE FIRST REVOLT-

01:55:47.674 --> 01:55:48.274
NOT WITH WHEN IT COMES TO

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:50.376
DECERTIFICATION WITH FORTY FIVE

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:51.811
OTHER STATES ALREADY HAVE DONE

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:55.214
THIS SO THIS IS NOT A YOU

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:59.552
SHOULD NOT BE A CONTROVERSIAL-

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:00.086
CONCEPT THAT WE'RE TALKING

01:56:00.153 --> 01:56:01.354
ABOUT- HOW WE DO IT IS

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:03.856
IMPORTANT- DUE PROCESS IS

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:06.893
IMPORTANT- WHO MAKES THE

01:56:06.959 --> 01:56:09.295
DECISION IS IMPORTANT. SO I'M

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:10.730
SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT THE

01:56:10.797 --> 01:56:13.032
DECERTIFICATION. AT THIS TIME I

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:14.734
DON'T HAVE A FIRM OPINION ABOUT

01:56:14.801 --> 01:56:16.903
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT BODIES

01:56:16.969 --> 01:56:18.438
THAT COULD BE JUNE THE

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:19.238
DECERTIFICATION OF COURSE

01:56:19.305 --> 01:56:20.473

OJ I'D LIKE TO GIVE THAT SOME

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.378
THOUGHT IF- IF POSSIBLE MAYBE

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:27.280
CONSULT WITH SOME OF THE-

01:56:27.347 --> 01:56:28.514
EXPERT IN DOJ ON THIS ISSUE

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:30.149
JUST TO PROVIDE AN OPINION ON

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:32.285
THAT BUT- I THINK IT IS

01:56:32.352 --> 01:56:33.986
IMPORTANT WHERE IT RESTS.AND

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:37.256
WE'RE RESIDES BECAUSE- YOU KNOW

01:56:37.323 --> 01:56:38.691
WE ALL BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WHO

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:40.560
HAS COMMITTED EGREGIOUS

01:56:40.626 --> 01:56:41.661
MISCONDUCT SHOULD NOT BE ABLE

01:56:41.728 --> 01:56:43.830
TO BE FIRED FROM A JOB AND THEN

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:45.765
POP UP SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HER

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:48.000
COMMUNITIES IN THAT NEW PLACE-

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:49.936
BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE TRUST IN IN

01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:51.170
THAT SYSTEM THAT IS BEING DONE

01:56:51.237 --> 01:56:52.839
RIGHT. AND ACCURATELY AND

01:56:52.905 --> 01:56:55.708
FAIRLY SO- I LIKE TO GET BACK

01:56:55.775 --> 01:56:56.509
TO YOU ON THAT AFTER AFTER

FOR NOT THE CHAIR BUT- THE

01:59:54.587 --> 01:59:57.056
LEADER OF. THE STATE ASSEMBLY

THIS PROCESS IT'S CLEARLY AN

02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:03.629
HONOR. AND THERE THERE ARE A

02:00:03.696 --> 02:00:08.234
FEW LEGISLATORS THAT- HAVE LESS

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:09.869

THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW THINGS

THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK

02:00:31.257 --> 02:00:33.593

VERY VERY HEARTFELT. SENTIMENTS

THAT I HAVE TOWARDS POLICE

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:50.142
ACCOUNTABILITY. I BELIEVE IT'S

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:52.178
HURTFUL AND UNFAIR TO DEFINE

02:00:52.244 --> 02:00:53.646
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION

02:00:53.713 --> 02:00:55.615
THROUGH MISCONDUCT OF A FEW.

02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:57.416
AND INSTEAD I BELIEVE THAT WE

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.318
MUST LEARN FROM THAT MISCONDUCT

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:02.521
AND MUST REDEFINE. THE

02:01:02.588 --> 02:01:03.022
PROFESSION TO REASONABLE

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:05.124
MEASURES. AND I'M HOPING THAT

02:01:05.191 --> 02:01:06.225
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:08.928
LAW ENFORCEMENT. IN ARRIVING AT

02:01:08.995 --> 02:01:12.465
SOLUTIONS BECAUSE- EXCLUSION

02:01:12.531 --> 02:01:14.266
LEADS TO WITNESS AN INCLUSION

02:01:14.333 --> 02:01:16.369
LEADS TO STRENGTH AND I WOULD

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:18.437
JUST LIKE TO MAKE THOSE REMARKS

02:01:18.504 --> 02:01:19.005

02:01:19.071 --> 02:01:21.874
VERY VERY. IMPORTANT TO THE OF

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.776
PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR STATE

02:01:23.843 --> 02:01:27.046
HERE. AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN. BY

02:01:27.113 --> 02:01:29.448
FOLLOWING UP WITH THE- SOME OF

02:01:29.515 --> 02:01:31.083
THE REMARKS OF THAT WERE

02:01:31.150 --> 02:01:32.485

02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.403
ECONOMICALLY A BIG BIG PROBLEM

02:01:50.469 --> 02:01:53.673

GROWERS ANALYSTS AT RETAILERS

THE STATE WOULD SHIFT THE

02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:25.738
AUTHORITY TO LOCALS IN THE

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:26.372
LOCALS WOULD SHIP THE AUTHORITY

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:27.873
TO THE STATE. AND SO AS THE

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:30.543

THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWS- TO ME IT

02:06:00.819 --> 02:06:02.488
IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IT WAS

02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:04.323
NOT A WARM EMBRACE OF THE

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:06.425
STATUS QUO MONEY BAIL SYSTEM. I

02:06:06.492 --> 02:06:08.227
DID SEE ONE ADVERTISEMENT I DID

02:06:08.294 --> 02:06:09.628
SEE ONE CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATION

02:06:09.695 --> 02:06:11.497
I DON'T SEE ONE COMMERCIAL THAT

02:06:11.563 --> 02:06:13.198
SAID VOTE FOR PROP TWENTY FIVE

02:06:13.265 --> 02:06:15.200
BECAUSE THE EXISTING MONEY BAIL

02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:16.402
SYSTEM IS GOOD. THE ONLY

02:06:16.468 --> 02:06:17.970
DISCUSSION THE ONLY DEBATE THE

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:19.872
ONLY CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATION.

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:21.173
WAS ABOUT WHAT THE REPLACEMENT

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:22.775
SYSTEM SHOULD BE AND WHETHER

02:06:22.841 --> 02:06:24.043
THERE WERE THE PROPOSED FREE

02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:27.212
TRIAL REPLACEMENT SYSTEM. IN SB

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:29.615
TEN IN PROP TWENTY FIVE. WAS

02:06:29.682 --> 02:06:31.050
APPROPRIATE. THERE WERE SOME

02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:32.384
VERY POWERFUL PROGRESSIVE

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:33.686
VOICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HE

02:06:33.752 --> 02:06:35.587
DID NOT THINK IT WAS

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:36.188
APPROPRIATE. THEY HAD ANOTHER

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:37.823
VISION. AND THAT'S WHERE I

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.224
THINK THAT'S WHAT I THINK. THAT

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:41.160
I FEEL YOUR PROPOSITION TWENTY

02:06:41.226 --> 02:06:42.561
FIVE STANFORD STANDS FOR. THE

02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:45.864
PROPOSITION THAT. MONEY BAIL-

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:50.035
IS HOME SAFE UNFAIR UNJUST- AND

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:52.271
WE DON'T YET AGREE ON WHAT THE

02:06:52.338 --> 02:06:54.406
REPLACEMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE.

02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:55.574
OTHERS WILL DISAGREE WITHOUT

02:06:55.641 --> 02:06:56.508
THAT'S MY VIEW SO YOU'RE SO

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:58.811
IT'S CLEAR I BELIEVE I AM BEING

02:06:58.877 --> 02:06:59.812
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:02.648
VOTERS- OF CALIFORNIA I HAVE

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:04.249
STATED THEY HAVE THAT BELIEVE

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:05.317
THEY STATED THAT THEY WANT ME

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:06.151
TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:08.988
BOARD. AND IDENTIFY A FAIR

02:07:09.054 --> 02:07:10.189
SYSTEM TO THE EXISTING STATUS

02:07:10.255 --> 02:07:13.192
QUO DUST THE BILL. THAT SENATOR

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:14.660
HERTZBERG SENATOR SKINNER AND I

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:16.395
AUTHORED. HAD MULTIPLE

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:21.133
COMPONENTS- ONE- THAT THAT. WAS

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.368
TO REQUIRE THAT THE ABILITY TO

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:25.237
PAY BE CONSIDERED IN SETTING

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:28.073
BAIL THE STATE SUPREME COURT

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:29.174
JUSTICE CITED THAT THAT IS THE

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:31.510
LAW OFFICE OF THE STATE SO THAT

02:07:31.577 --> 02:07:35.047
COMPONENT IS CONSTITUTIONAL IS

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:37.016
LEGAL WE ALSO HAD A ZERO BAIL

02:07:37.082 --> 02:07:39.451
COMPONENT WHICH MIRRORED IS IT

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:41.453
IS ZERO BAIL POLICY OF THE

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:43.756
JUDICIAL COUNCIL DURING COATED-

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:44.690
I HAD A COUPON IT SO THAT

02:07:44.757 --> 02:07:50.496
THERE'S NO COST FOR- ANY-

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:54.166
CONDITIONS OF. RELEASE AND IT

02:07:54.233 --> 02:07:55.667
ALSO HAD A HIGHER REFUND

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:56.435
ABILITY COMPONENT BUT IT

02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:58.937
DIDN'T- IT IS OKAY SO IF IT'S A

02:07:59.004 --> 02:08:01.373
PROPOSAL- THE LEGISLATURE WILL

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.243
DECIDE THOSE ISSUES WERE NOT

02:08:04.309 --> 02:08:05.911
VOTED ON AND TOP TWENTY FIVE.

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:08.547
THE MORNING PROPERTY FIVE- SO

02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:09.448
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:12.885
LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER- THIS

02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:14.053
IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:15.120
SUBJECT TO DEBATE CANNOT

02:08:15.187 --> 02:08:16.688
DELIVER TO PROCESS. MAYBE TO

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.624
PASS MAYBE IT WON'T- BUT THAT

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:19.992
THE INABILITY TO PAY COMPONENT

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:21.660
IS BECAUSE OF THE JUDICIAL

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:23.729
DECISION A CONFERENCE IS NOW. A

02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:26.432
LOT OF THE STATE. DEFINITELY

02:08:26.498 --> 02:08:27.699
EXCUSE ME FOR THAT SO THAT THAT

PERSONAL CHOICE MY PERSONAL

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:35.441
VIEW. I THINK IT'S WRONG FOR

02:08:35.507 --> 02:08:37.910
CALIFORNIA. I DID STAND WITH

02:08:37.976 --> 02:08:39.244
THE GOVERNOR WHEN HE ISSUE THE

02:08:39.311 --> 02:08:39.912
MORE TIME I WAS PROUD TO DO

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.091
CONSIDERATION BY THE VOTERS OF

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:54.660
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO-

02:08:54.726 --> 02:08:55.794
ABOLISHED THE DEATH PENALTY

02:08:55.861 --> 02:08:59.064
THAT- IS CONSISTENT. WITH

02:08:59.131 --> 02:09:01.934
SUPPORTING THE VOTERS BECAUSE

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:02.568
IT ALLOWS THE VOTERS TO DECIDE.

02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:07.039
AND HAVE. DEFINITELY MY VIEW IS

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:11.977
IN HUMANE. IT DOES NOT DETER-

02:09:12.044 --> 02:09:14.546
IT IS BOTH FALLIBLE MEANING

02:09:14.613 --> 02:09:15.614
WERE WRONG WHEN YOU SEE THE

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.716
DEATH PENALTY SOMETIMES- THE

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:20.052
MOST EGREGIOUS CASES WHEN WE-

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:21.820
HAVE ISSUE THE DENTIST

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:29.895
CAN'T BE BOTH. AND IT'S RACIST

02:09:29.962 --> 02:09:31.497
SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I'M

02:09:31.563 --> 02:09:33.699

02:13:35.974 --> 02:13:37.442
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST

02:13:37.509 --> 02:13:39.077
QUESTION DEALS WITH HATE CRIME

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:40.579
SO WHICH YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

02:13:40.645 --> 02:13:42.781
OPENING REMARKS. I IN FACT OVER

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.015
THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE SEEN AS

02:13:44.082 --> 02:13:45.617
SKYROCKETING OF RACIALLY

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:48.086
MOTIVATED HATE INCIDENTS

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:49.654
AGAINST ASIAN COMMUNITY ACROSS

02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:51.690
THE STATE. AND THE NATION. THE

02:13:51.757 --> 02:13:53.759
ORGANIZATIONS STOP EIGHTY P. I.

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:56.495
T. REPORTED ABOUT THE- FOUR

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:57.929
THOUSAND PIECES OF HATE RELATED

02:13:57.996 --> 02:13:59.631
INCIDENTS OVER A TEN MONTH

02:13:59.698 --> 02:14:02.234
PERIOD. AND THIS IS ONLY THE

02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:04.002
TIP OF THE ICEBERG. NOW THIS

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:05.804
ISSUE IS PERSONAL TO ME BUT-

02:14:05.871 --> 02:14:07.305
THE SENTIMENT IS ALSO SHARED BY

02:14:07.372 --> 02:14:09.207
MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES BECAUSE-

02:14:09.274 --> 02:14:11.309
WHEN THESE VIOLENT ACTS- I

02:14:11.376 --> 02:14:12.744
COMMITTED THERE NOT. ONLY

02:14:12.811 --> 02:14:13.879
IMPACTING THE INDIVIDUAL

02:14:13.945 --> 02:14:16.181
VICTIMS AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY.

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:19.117
AT LARGE. HOWEVER MANY HATE

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:21.720
CRIMES AND VIOLENT ACTS ARE NOT

02:14:21.787 --> 02:14:23.555
BEING REPORTED OR PROSECUTED

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:26.558
BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROVE

02:14:26.625 --> 02:14:28.427
THE PERPETRATORS SO INTENT. MY

02:14:28.493 --> 02:14:30.395
QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE DOJ

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:32.230
UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP. IMPROVE

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:34.366
THE DETECTION INVESTIGATION AND

02:14:34.433 --> 02:14:36.201
PROSECUTION OF HATE CRIMES AND

02:14:36.268 --> 02:14:38.470
HATE INCIDENTS. AND AS A COOK A

02:14:38.537 --> 02:14:39.771
QUICK FOLLOW UP I UNDERSTAND

02:14:39.838 --> 02:14:41.940
THAT THE RAPID RESPONSE TEAM

02:14:42.007 --> 02:14:45.744
WITHIN THE DOJ FOCUSES ALL ONLY

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:47.813
ON A SERIOUS CRIMES. SO THE

02:14:47.879 --> 02:14:49.815
QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THE DOJ

02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:51.082
AGAIN UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP

02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:54.352
WORK WITH OTHER AGENCIES TO

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:57.222

RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO HATE

02:15:06.331 --> 02:15:07.432
CRIMES WERE AN AWFUL STATE OF

02:15:07.499 --> 02:15:08.934
CRISIS AND A FULL STATE OF

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:09.901

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:39.097
UNACCEPTABLE AND WE HAVE A

THE PASSION ON THIS ISSUE AND

02:15:56.081 --> 02:15:57.983
THE PROPOSAL OF SOLUTIONS THAT

02:15:58.049 --> 02:16:02.587
HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD- THE DOJ.

02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:03.188
CAN DO A NUMBER OF THINGS ONE

02:16:03.255 --> 02:16:06.691
IS. HELP OTHER JURISDICTION'S

02:16:06.758 --> 02:16:08.627
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

APPROPRIATELY IDENTIFY AND

02:16:10.529 --> 02:16:12.297
INVESTIGATE HATE CRIMES THAT IS

02:16:12.364 --> 02:16:14.366
NOT ALWAYS SOMETHING. THAT IS

02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:17.402
FOCUSED ON PRIORITIZED- AND LET

INTO SAFE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:21.940
ONE REALLY POINTING THE DOJ CAN

02:16:22.007 --> 02:16:23.775
DO IS TO CARE. AND TO

02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.610
PRIORITIZE THIS ISSUE AND MAKE

02:16:25.677 --> 02:16:29.047
IT A TOP PRIORITY AND- THE

02:16:29.114 --> 02:16:30.382
INVESTIGATION AND

02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:31.783
IDENTIFICATION SHE WAS ONE

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:32.684
BUILDING STRONG RELATIONS

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:33.652
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:16:33.718 --> 02:16:34.753
COMMUNITY SO THAT COMMUNITY

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:36.855
WILL COME FORWARD AND REPORT.

02:16:36.922 --> 02:16:39.224
I'M SUPPORTING VICTIMS- IN

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:40.525
DIFFERENT WAYS WHETHER IT BE

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.160
PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH

INFORMED CARE FOR LANGUAGE

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:48.533
ACCESS- FOR SOME OF OUR API

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:51.336
COMMITTEE MEMBERS- FROM THAT

02:16:51.403 --> 02:16:53.505
WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE AND HELPFUL

02:16:53.572 --> 02:16:54.673
AND THEN THE REPORTING SYSTEM

02:16:54.739 --> 02:16:56.975
IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT- I KNOW

02:16:57.042 --> 02:16:58.109
SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE PUT

02:16:58.176 --> 02:16:59.311
FORWARD AN IDEA FOR A HE CAN

02:16:59.377 --> 02:17:01.179
TIMELINE. I TO MAKE SURE THAT

WE GET ACCURATE REPORTING THEY

02:17:03.114 --> 02:17:05.216
CAN DRIVE APPROPRIATE POLICY

02:17:05.283 --> 02:17:09.621
AND INTERVENTION. SO- YOU KNOW

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:12.457
WE CAN PUT UP- TO ABOUT- TO

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:13.858
SHOW OTHER. THE BEST WAY TO

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:14.859
ADDRESS TAKE HOME SO WE CAN

02:17:14.926 --> 02:17:16.695
SHOW THAT'S PACKED. ONE THING I

02:17:16.761 --> 02:17:18.997
THINK IS SUPER. IS TO GET OUT

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:21.800
IN THE COMMUNITY. AND LISTEN.

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:23.868
AND SEE COMMUNITY C. IMPACTS

02:17:23.935 --> 02:17:25.670
MANY WHO'VE BEEN HURT. ASK WHAT

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:27.572
THEY NEED ASK WHAT- SUPPORT THE

02:17:27.639 --> 02:17:29.574
DOJ CAN PROVIDE SO I KNOW

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:33.645
THAT'S A- RATHER- LONG MENU OF

02:17:33.712 --> 02:17:35.981
OPTIONS. AND ACTIONS THAT THE

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.182
DOJ CAN TAKE BUT IT'S SOMETHING

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:40.952
THAT I'VE. THOUGHT ABOUT AND I

02:17:41.019 --> 02:17:42.554
THINK ALL CAN ADD VALUE.

02:17:42.621 --> 02:17:44.322
ANOTHER AREA OF INTEREST FOR ME

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:46.591
IS- DATA PRIVACY WHICH IS-

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:47.993
BECOMING MORE AND MORE.

02:17:48.059 --> 02:17:49.094
IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:51.096
THAT. ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:53.164
IS CONSTANTLY BEING COLLECTED

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:55.634
AND SHARED BY OTHERS- LAST YEAR

02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:57.168
IN TWENTY TWENTY TO VOTERS IN

02:17:57.235 --> 02:17:58.670
CALIFORNIA. A PASSED

02:17:58.737 --> 02:18:00.805
PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR- WHICH

02:18:00.872 --> 02:18:02.607
BASICALLY CREATED THE NEW A

02:18:02.674 --> 02:18:04.542
NEW. PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:06.711
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. HOW DO

02:38:45.482 --> 02:38:46.817
SCHOOL ECONOMICS WAY OF

02:38:46.884 --> 02:38:49.186
DEFINING A MONOPOLY. AND MAYBE

02:38:49.253 --> 02:38:51.288
OUR STATUTES NEED TO BE UPDATED

02:38:51.355 --> 02:38:52.155
MAYBE THEY NEED TO BE

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:55.292
MODERNIZED. AND I SEE THAT IS

02:38:55.359 --> 02:38:55.792
AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT A

02:38:55.859 --> 02:38:56.693
CRITICAL ONE. OF CONSUMER

02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.697
PROTECTION AND SAFEGUARDING

02:39:00.764 --> 02:39:02.099
THAT PRIVACY THAT CALIFORNIANS

02:39:02.165 --> 02:39:05.903
EXPECT- IN THEIR DATA AND THEIR

02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:06.637
HOME IN THE USE OF THEIR

02:39:06.703 --> 02:39:10.574
DEVICES AND SO ON SO FORTH. SO

02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:12.409
LONG WINDED QUESTION BUT IT

02:39:12.476 --> 02:39:14.111
COMES DOWN TO ARE YOU OPEN TO

02:39:14.177 --> 02:39:15.746
EXAMINING WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S

02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:17.381
ANTI TRUST LAWS SHOULD BE

02:39:17.447 --> 02:39:18.615
REFORMED OR MODERNIZE ALONG

02:39:18.682 --> 02:39:21.752
THOSE LINES- AND MAYBE THERE

02:39:21.818 --> 02:39:23.887
MAYBE THERE ADEQUATE BUT IT

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:24.488
SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:39:24.554 --> 02:39:26.089
SHOULD BE LOOKED AT. AND

02:39:26.156 --> 02:39:27.524
SECONDLY MORE GENERALLY WHAT

02:39:27.591 --> 02:39:28.659
ARE YOUR ROLE WHAT ARE YOUR

02:39:28.725 --> 02:39:30.193
VIEWS ON THE ROLE OF THE

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:32.562
CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. IN

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:34.831
PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY.

02:39:34.898 --> 02:39:42.039
THANK YOU. I THINK THAT THE

02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:42.606
IMPORTANT GOAL IS TO KEEP IN

02:39:42.673 --> 02:39:45.676
MIND OUR- BACK TO THAT FRAME I

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:47.044
HAD ABOUT WHAT I THINK THE

02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:48.946
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ROLE IS. THE

02:39:49.012 --> 02:39:50.147
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ROLE THIS

02:39:50.213 --> 02:39:52.816
TIME JERRY. IN A BROADLY

02:39:52.883 --> 02:39:55.185
SPEAKING PROTECT A LITTLE BACK.

02:39:55.252 --> 02:39:57.621
AGAINST OVERREACH AND ABUSE OF

02:39:57.688 --> 02:39:59.690
POWER BY THE BIG GUY. AND IT

02:39:59.756 --> 02:40:02.559
COULD TAKE A LOT OF FORMS-

02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:07.497
CERTAINLY- IF A COMPANY IS-

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.900
OVERSTEPPING ITS ITS LEGAL

02:40:09.967 --> 02:40:12.002
AUTHORITY IF IT IS ENGAGE IN

02:40:12.069 --> 02:40:13.737
ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES IT

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:15.105
IS IF IT IS VIOLATING CONSUMER

02:40:15.172 --> 02:40:16.139
PRIVACY BECAUSE ABUSING

02:40:16.206 --> 02:40:18.008
CONSUMERS AND OTHER WAYS. AND

02:40:18.075 --> 02:40:19.943
IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW IT

02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:21.111
DOESN'T MATTER WHERE THEY'RE

02:40:21.178 --> 02:40:23.613
FROM OR HOW BIG THEY ARE- THE

02:40:23.680 --> 02:40:25.849
ATTORNEY GENERAL- AND IT SHOULD

02:40:25.916 --> 02:40:26.383
I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING

02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:29.353
CONFIRMED SHOULD. TAKE ON. THAT

02:40:29.419 --> 02:40:33.357
COMPANY AND GO WITH A LAN FACTS

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:35.158
TAKE THEM. IN SO. I THINK IT IS

02:40:35.225 --> 02:40:35.959
THE ROLE OF THE ATTORNEY

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:37.361
GENERAL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS

02:40:37.427 --> 02:40:40.564
FROM ABUSE. BY ANY POWERFUL

02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:42.432
ABUSERS THAT COULD BE TECH

02:40:42.499 --> 02:40:44.201
COMPANIES IF THE LAW AND THE

02:40:44.267 --> 02:40:46.470
FACTS. ARE DETERMINED SO HERE

02:40:46.536 --> 02:40:48.472
THE POINT IS ABOUT ADVOCACY OF

02:40:48.538 --> 02:40:49.639
THE LAW ATTENTION NEED FOR

02:40:49.706 --> 02:40:51.708
MODERNIZATION. I THINK IT'S A

02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:52.442
REALLY INTERESTING INSIGHT

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:53.944
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY BEEN VERY

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:55.278
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AND LOOK

02:40:55.345 --> 02:40:57.981
INTO THIS ISSUE- I DON'T KNOW

02:40:58.048 --> 02:41:01.318
THE ANSWER. BUT I DO- I

02:41:01.385 --> 02:41:03.520
UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT THAT-

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:05.455
BIG TECH COMPANIES THEIR

02:41:05.522 --> 02:41:06.089
BUSINESS MODELS THEIR BUSINESS

02:41:06.156 --> 02:41:08.225
APPROACHES. ARE DIFFERENT

02:41:08.291 --> 02:41:09.626
PERHAPS THAN OIL AND STILL

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:12.162
COMPANIES FROM DECADES AGO. AND

02:41:12.229 --> 02:41:15.499
THE- ORIGINAL GOAL THAT WE HAD

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:17.567
TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM PRICE

02:41:17.634 --> 02:41:18.869
GOUGING ANTI COMPETITIVE

02:41:18.935 --> 02:41:21.038
PRACTICES AND THE ABUSE OF

02:41:21.104 --> 02:41:23.807
MONOPOLIES- THAT SHOULD BE

02:41:23.874 --> 02:41:26.576
MAINTAINED THAT PROTECTION. AND

02:41:26.643 --> 02:41:29.312
I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE SOME

02:41:29.379 --> 02:41:31.715
ADDITIONAL THINKING AND

02:41:31.782 --> 02:41:32.983
COLLABORATING AROUND WHETHER

02:41:33.050 --> 02:41:34.217
IT'S NECESSARY AND IF SO WHAT

02:41:34.284 --> 02:41:35.752
THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT I

COMMITTED TO SEEING IT SUCCEED.

02:53:00.303 --> 02:53:01.437
ONE CRITICAL COMPONENT TO MAKE

02:53:01.504 --> 02:53:04.006
IT SUCCEED IS TO STOP THE PART

02:53:04.073 --> 02:53:05.408
THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE FROM

02:53:05.475 --> 02:53:06.776

VALUES AROUND NOT PUTTING

02:53:13.850 --> 02:53:16.986
PEOPLE IN JAIL. BUT ANY LISTEN

02:53:17.053 --> 02:53:18.187
MARKETPLACE THROUGH OTHER MEANS.

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:20.757
THANK YOU AND SO I WANT TO JUST

02:53:20.823 --> 02:53:22.024
MAKE SURE WE JUST REITERATE OF.

02:53:22.091 --> 02:53:25.628
ABOUT A FIFTY FIVE THINGS BAD

02:53:25.695 --> 02:53:28.164
APPS THAT APPLE'S BAD CITIES

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:29.699
THAT DEPARTMENTS AND YOU JUST

02:53:29.766 --> 02:53:33.035
FASTER BOB THAT CANNABIS- AS

02:53:33.102 --> 02:53:34.137
YOU PROBABLY HEARD DESPITE FROM

02:53:34.203 --> 02:53:35.505
EVERYBODY HERE AND AS YOU KNOW

02:53:35.571 --> 02:53:37.240
WHEN WE GOT HERE. WE WERE TOLD

02:53:37.306 --> 02:53:38.641
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT

02:53:38.708 --> 02:53:40.276
THEY WOULD GET THEY WOULD FIX

02:53:40.343 --> 02:53:42.612
APPS GIVES ENOUGH TIMES AND WE

02:53:42.678 --> 02:53:45.181
WOULD FIX IT. AND SO WHAT I'M

02:53:45.248 --> 02:53:48.684
GOING TO ASK YOU IS NOT ONLY DO

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:49.352
YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FIX IT.

02:53:49.418 --> 02:53:50.887
BUT YOU GIVE US MEASURES OF

02:53:50.953 --> 02:53:52.955
SUCCESS ON HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

02:53:53.022 --> 02:53:55.792
FIX IT. SO THAT. AS I THINK YOU

02:53:55.858 --> 02:53:57.760
SAID IN WHEN YOUR STATEMENTS-

02:53:57.827 --> 02:53:58.694
YOU BELIEVE THAT WE CLEANED

02:53:58.761 --> 02:54:01.130
OFF. THE LIST BUT THEN MORE

02:54:01.197 --> 02:54:03.332
CAME IN- I DON'T THINK THIS

02:54:03.399 --> 02:54:05.301
LEGISLATURE KNEW THAT. INSTEAD

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:07.436
BY THE TIME WE HEARD ABOUT WHAT

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:08.838
WAS GOING ON AGAIN IT WAS AT

02:54:08.905 --> 02:54:10.206
THE SAME NUMBER SO THAT WAS

02:54:10.273 --> 02:54:11.541
KIND OF THE FRUSTRATION WE GAVE

02:54:11.607 --> 02:54:12.708
YOU TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:54:12.775 --> 02:54:14.744
THAT YOU GAVE AGES TWENTY

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:15.845
MILLION DOLLARS THERE WAS SOME

02:54:15.912 --> 02:54:18.014
SUCCESS. BUT THEN THE BACKLOG

02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:20.116
CAME UP AGAIN. I THINK JUST

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:22.418

ONLY WILL WE MAY EVEN GIVE MORE

02:54:29.859 --> 02:54:31.861
MONEY. BUT WE MAY BE ABLE TO

02:54:31.928 --> 02:54:34.363
TALK ABOUT- INNOVATIVE WAYS TO

02:54:34.430 --> 02:54:38.301
GET THIS DONE. AND WE CAN BE-PARTNERS IN EVENTUALLY LEARNING

02:54:38.367 --> 02:54:39.702
TO LISTEN BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT

02:54:39.769 --> 02:54:43.206
FROM. OUR COLLEAGUES- MAY NOT

02:54:43.272 --> 02:54:45.808
BE SO- ENAMORED WITH GUN

02:54:45.875 --> 02:54:47.810
CONTROL. THAT WHY WE GOING

02:54:47.877 --> 02:54:49.579
AFTER THE BAD GUYS WELL THIS IS

02:54:49.645 --> 02:54:51.514
A PERFECT EXAMPLE LET'S GO

02:54:51.581 --> 02:54:53.482

LET'S MAKE A VALIANT EFFORT TO

02:54:54.750 --> 02:54:59.822

I. THANK TO WITH YOU TO THE

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:04.627
APPS ISSUE- I THINK IT IS

02:55:04.694 --> 02:55:06.429
IMPORTANT TO HAVE METRICS-

02:55:06.495 --> 02:55:07.797
INTERNALLY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:55:07.864 --> 02:55:09.232
JUSTICE AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF

02:55:09.298 --> 02:55:10.333
BEING CONFIRMED AND ALSO.

02:55:10.399 --> 02:55:11.968
EXPRESSED TWO PARTNERS AND

02:55:12.034 --> 02:55:13.336
LEGISLATURE LIKE YOU CARE

02:55:13.402 --> 02:55:15.404
DEEPLY ABOUT THIS. I THINK ONE

02:55:15.471 --> 02:55:16.772
OF THE I THOUGHT SOME UNIQUE

02:55:16.839 --> 02:55:18.007
ABOUT ABOUT ME THAT'S BEEN MY

02:55:18.074 --> 02:55:19.909
GOOD FORTUNE IS THAT- MY

02:55:19.976 --> 02:55:22.278
PATHWAY. TO THIS NOMINATION HAS

02:55:22.345 --> 02:55:23.512
BEEN THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE.

02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:25.081
THROUGH WORKING WITH WITH YOU.

02:55:25.147 --> 02:55:26.382
ALL OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE IN

02:55:26.449 --> 02:55:28.284
OUR CLASS. BY THE NUMBERS ON

02:55:28.351 --> 02:55:30.152
THIS FLOOR ON THE OTHER FLOOR.

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:33.256
AND I'VE LEARNED. SO MUCH FROM

02:55:33.322 --> 02:55:35.191
FROM MY COLLEAGUES I'VE I'VE

02:55:35.258 --> 02:55:36.425
SEEN THINGS DIFFERENTLY I'VE

02:55:36.492 --> 02:55:38.060
GROWN AS A LEADER. AND I

02:55:38.127 --> 02:55:40.029
APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AND-

02:55:40.096 --> 02:55:41.130
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DON'T

02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:42.665
WANT THAT PARTNERSHIP TO END.

02:55:42.732 --> 02:55:45.201
IF I AM CONFIRMED. I THINK IT'S

02:55:45.268 --> 02:55:45.701
IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK

02:55:45.768 --> 02:55:47.670
TOGETHER. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE

02:55:47.737 --> 02:55:48.537
HAVE A COMMON GOAL LIKE

02:55:48.604 --> 02:55:51.040
REDUCING. THE APPS LIST TO THE

02:55:51.107 --> 02:55:53.309
LOWEST AMOUNT POSSIBLE SO. I

02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:54.477
INVITE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK

02:55:54.543 --> 02:55:56.646
TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY METRICS.

02:55:56.712 --> 02:55:59.615
AND TAB. I BE SUCCESSFUL AND

02:55:59.682 --> 02:56:00.816
HAVE US UNDERSTAND COMMUNICATE

02:56:00.883 --> 02:56:02.385
WITH ONE ANOTHER WHAT THAT

02:56:02.451 --> 02:56:04.186
SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE. J. AND THEN

02:56:04.253 --> 02:56:06.322
BAD APPLES ESPECIALLY IN IN LAW

02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:09.792
ENFORCEMENT- IT IS. IT HURTS

02:56:09.859 --> 02:56:12.595
THEM. MORE THAN IT IT HURTS US

02:56:12.662 --> 02:56:15.197
BECAUSE THE INTEGRITY. OF LAW

02:56:15.264 --> 02:56:17.566
ENFORCEMENT AS IT GOES DOWN-

02:56:17.633 --> 02:56:19.735
AND THEY START TO LOSE THAT- I

02:56:19.802 --> 02:56:21.537
THINK IT JUST. DISRUPTS THE

02:56:21.604 --> 02:56:23.673
WHOLE PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM. IT

02:56:23.739 --> 02:56:24.941
JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE

02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:29.378
SKEWS SO- IF EVERYONE- LAW

02:56:29.445 --> 02:56:30.179
ENFORCEMENT DETAINEE GENERAL'S

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:32.715
OFFICE. AND US IN THE

02:56:32.782 --> 02:56:35.017
LEGISLATURE. IF WE WORK REAL

02:56:35.084 --> 02:56:37.053
HARD TO AS YOU YOU SAID. WE'RE

02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:39.255
NOT LOOKING AT A LOT OF PEOPLE-

02:56:39.322 --> 02:56:43.159
BUT 1% OF ANY GROUP. COULD

02:56:43.225 --> 02:56:45.227
BECOME VERY PROBLEMATIC ONE

02:56:45.294 --> 02:56:48.264
PERCENT. OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY.

02:56:48.331 --> 02:56:50.132
THEN WE ALL GET PAINTED. WITH

02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:51.167
THE SAME BRUSH THAT THEY'RE ALL

02:56:51.233 --> 02:56:53.970
THAT WAY. AND SO WE BOTH.

02:56:54.036 --> 02:56:56.005
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO

02:56:56.072 --> 02:57:00.876
BE IN. IN A BUBBLE AND HAVE

02:57:00.943 --> 02:57:01.844
PEOPLE LOOK AT A SO- I

02:57:01.911 --> 02:57:03.045
PURCHASED MY TO COMMIT THAT. WE

02:57:03.112 --> 02:57:06.048
AGGRESSIVE- GO AFTER AND

02:57:06.115 --> 02:57:08.351
PROSECUTE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:57:08.417 --> 02:57:10.653
MAY NOT SHOULD NOT FROM THE

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:12.888
BEGINNING EVER BECOME LAW

02:57:12.955 --> 02:57:15.224
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS- AND THAT

02:57:15.291 --> 02:57:16.826
WE GET MORE PEACE OFFICERS IN

02:57:16.892 --> 02:57:20.029
SO WE JUST PROFESSIONAL ICE-

02:57:20.096 --> 02:57:23.199
THE ORGANIZATIONS. I THINK IT'S

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:25.634
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A

02:57:25.701 --> 02:57:26.268
LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY THAT

02:57:26.335 --> 02:57:28.070
HAS THE TRUST OF. THE COMMUNITY

02:57:28.137 --> 02:57:31.073
AT LARGE AND THAT TAKES A

02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:33.342
DIFFERENT FORMS PART OF IT IS

02:57:33.409 --> 02:57:34.510
APPROPRIATE TRAINING AND

02:57:34.577 --> 02:57:36.912
SUPPORT- PART OF IT IS

02:57:36.979 --> 02:57:40.149
ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I KNOW

02:57:40.216 --> 02:57:40.649
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT

02:57:40.716 --> 02:57:42.585
ACCOUNTABILITY SO MINE CANNOT

02:57:42.651 --> 02:57:43.819
CAN REALLY HELPS LEAD TO TRUST

02:57:43.886 --> 02:57:47.156
SO STANDING A BABY FIFTEEN OH

02:57:47.223 --> 02:57:49.325
SIX DECERTIFICATION- THOSE ARE

02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:50.126
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT

02:57:50.192 --> 02:57:53.129
CONVERSATION SO I AM COMMITTED

02:57:53.195 --> 02:57:56.799
TO GETTING. BUILDING THAT TRUST-BACK INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:57:56.866 --> 02:57:58.901
THE COMMUNITY AND TAKING

02:57:58.968 --> 02:58:00.669
APPROPRIATE STEPS TO GET THERE.

02:58:00.736 --> 02:58:04.640
AND THEN UP. WHICH YOU MAY NOT

02:58:04.707 --> 02:58:05.274
KNOW WE HAVE BAD CITIES. AT THE

02:58:05.341 --> 02:58:06.709
LOWER SOUTHERN IN OF MY

02:58:06.776 --> 02:58:08.010
DISTRICT. YOU'VE HEARD OF

02:58:08.077 --> 02:58:10.713
BEFORE THE BELL BELL GARDENS

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:11.647
AND JUST RECENTLY THERE WAS AN

02:58:11.714 --> 02:58:14.283
ARTICLE. ABOUT HUNTINGTON PARK

02:58:14.350 --> 02:58:16.318
WHICH IS A PART OF MY WHERE.

02:58:16.385 --> 02:58:18.087
THEY'RE THEY'RE OFFERING BUDGET

02:58:18.154 --> 02:58:19.922
FOR PERSONNEL IS FOURTEEN

02:58:19.989 --> 02:58:22.124
MILLION DOLLARS. BUT THE WHOLE

02:58:22.191 --> 02:58:24.827
FINANCE DEPARTMENT WAS RAIDED

02:58:24.894 --> 02:58:27.897
BY THE FBI BECAUSE THEY SENT IN

02:58:27.963 --> 02:58:28.397
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR Y.

02:58:28.464 --> 02:58:30.766
TRANSFER. TO NEW YORK TO FOR

02:58:30.833 --> 02:58:33.002
GOD KNOWS WHAT- SO THAT

02:58:33.069 --> 02:58:35.037
OBVIOUSLY NO ACCOUNTABILITY BUT

02:58:35.104 --> 02:58:36.172
THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALL

02:58:36.238 --> 02:58:37.940
THOSE CRESCENT CITIES BECAUSE

02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:40.176
OF THE CORRUPT CRESCENT MOON-

02:58:40.242 --> 02:58:42.044
BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SO MANY.

02:58:42.111 --> 02:58:43.813
CITIES DOWN THERE AND ALMOST

02:58:43.879 --> 02:58:46.048

PREDECESSOR LEFT- I OFFERED

02:58:56.992 --> 02:58:59.595
HIM. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

02:58:59.662 --> 02:59:00.396
GIVE THEM MORE MONEY AND

02:59:00.463 --> 02:59:02.331
RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY GO IN

02:59:02.398 --> 02:59:04.900
THERE BECAUSE- LOOK THEY'RE

02:59:04.967 --> 02:59:07.937
STEALING MONEY FOR. FOR LATINO

02:59:08.003 --> 02:59:10.139
AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE JUST

JUST BEFORE THEY THEY- THEY

02:59:12.608 --> 02:59:13.742
CAN'T COME TO A MEETING LIKE

02:59:13.809 --> 02:59:15.311
THIS. AND THERE'S LOCAL CITY

02:59:15.377 --> 02:59:17.613
COUNCIL THEY GOTTA WORK. AND SO

02:59:17.680 --> 02:59:19.782
THEY CAN'T KEEP AN EYE ON-

02:59:19.849 --> 02:59:21.450
PEOPLE WHO ARE ROBBING THE CITY

02:59:21.517 --> 02:59:24.019
BLIND. SOMETIMES TWENTY MEAN

02:59:24.086 --> 02:59:24.753
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

WITH THE DEBT AND THEY HIDE

02:59:27.089 --> 02:59:29.558
BECAUSE- NO ONE'S REALLY MAKING

02:59:29.625 --> 02:59:30.392
A VALIANT EFFORT AND SO I WOULD

02:59:30.459 --> 02:59:32.328
HOPE. WORKING WITH THE DA'S

02:59:32.394 --> 02:59:35.364
OFFICE- IN LOS ANGELES WE CAN

02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:37.733

PRESIDENT OUT OF BUSINESS

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:40.970
BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT IT IT

02:59:41.036 --> 02:59:43.139
JUST ALSO MAKE PEOPLE NOT TRUST

02:59:43.205 --> 02:59:45.107
GOVERNMENT. AND ALL SO

HOPEFULLY YOU CAN COME UP WITH

02:59:46.675 --> 02:59:48.410

02:59:52.648 --> 02:59:56.752
SURPLUS. AFTER WE NEED TO PUT

02:59:56.819 --> 02:59:57.386
MORE MONEY IN THOSE DIRECTIONS

02:59:57.453 --> 02:59:57.987
AND IN CITIES. THAT WE KNOW.

02:59:58.053 --> 03:00:06.228

ANYMORE A LOT OF TIMES

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:45.494
GOVERNMENTS TRY TO SWEEP IT

03:01:45.561 --> 03:01:47.429
UNDER THE RUG. BECAUSE IT'S

03:01:47.496 --> 03:01:48.063
EMBARRASSING IT IS

03:01:48.130 --> 03:01:49.965
EMBARRASSING. BUT I ALSO

03:01:50.032 --> 03:01:52.067
BELIEVE IF YOU PROSECUTE PEOPLE

03:01:52.134 --> 03:01:54.236
WHO DO MALFEASANCE AND FRAUD IN

03:01:54.303 --> 03:01:56.505
GOVERNMENT. IS SEND A MESSAGE

03:01:56.572 --> 03:01:58.207
TO THE OTHERS DID NOT DO IT AND

KEEP US IN CHECK. I THINK IT'S

03:02:19.862 --> 03:02:24.566
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE THAT- THESE

03:02:24.633 --> 03:02:26.702
FUNDS THAT ARE MEANT FOR PEOPLE

03:02:26.769 --> 03:02:28.304

INVOLVED AND IT INVOLVES I

03:02:53.595 --> 03:02:54.096
THINK A MULTI JURISDICTIONAL

BEING INVOLVED BUT I'LL GO

HAPPENING. AND- TRY TO REMEDY

03:03:31.934 --> 03:03:34.503
THIS THE HORRIBLE- VIOLATION OF

03:03:34.570 --> 03:03:36.004
TRUST AND AFTER THESE CRITICAL

03:03:36.071 --> 03:03:37.306
TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT SHOULD BE

MISTER JONES SAWYER- MISS BONTA

03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:56.158
JUST TO A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

03:03:56.225 --> 03:03:56.959
REALLY KIND OF CLARIFICATION

03:03:57.025 --> 03:03:59.595
AND I THINK WHAT'S TRUE IS MOST

03:03:59.661 --> 03:04:00.529
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

03:04:00.596 --> 03:04:03.098
ASKED WERE INDIVIDUAL INTERESTS

03:04:03.165 --> 03:04:05.334
OF LEGISLATORS. BUT I THINK A

03:04:05.401 --> 03:04:06.602
LOT OF COMMON INTEREST FOR MOST

03:04:06.668 --> 03:04:10.139
OF THIS. PERFECT NOT TO BEAT A

03:04:10.205 --> 03:04:12.007
DEAD HORSE BUT THE IT'S LIKE

03:04:12.074 --> 03:04:13.842
THE APPS PROCESS AND THE

03:04:13.909 --> 03:04:15.377
FRUSTRATION THAT SITTING ON

03:04:15.444 --> 03:04:19.848
SOME FIVE WE'VE HAD AS WE TRY.

03:04:19.915 --> 03:04:21.483
TO PUSH THAT ISSUE AND YET THE

03:04:21.550 --> 03:04:23.252
REALITY IS WE WE'RE HEARING

03:04:23.318 --> 03:04:26.088
THOSE OF US. ESPECIALLY IN IN

03:04:26.155 --> 03:04:27.489
SO WITH SOME RURAL DISTRICTS.

03:04:27.556 --> 03:04:29.358
CARING DIFFERENT THINGS FROM

03:04:29.425 --> 03:04:31.493
SHERIFF'S AND IN AND LOCAL

03:04:31.560 --> 03:04:33.462
POLICE OFFICERS ABOUT. THEIR

03:04:33.529 --> 03:04:35.164
INVOLVEMENT IN TRYING TO GET

03:04:35.230 --> 03:04:36.498
GUNS OUT OF PEOPLE'S HANDS AND

03:04:36.565 --> 03:04:38.267
SO THE NOTION OF COMMUNICATING

03:04:38.333 --> 03:04:39.935
WITH THE LOCAL AGENCIES IN

03:04:40.002 --> 03:04:41.003
PROVIDING SOME SUPPORT AND SOME

03:04:41.069 --> 03:04:43.205
HELP I THINK IT'S IT IS REALLY

03:04:43.272 --> 03:04:45.941
A KEY ONE THERE BUT JUST A-

03:04:46.008 --> 03:04:48.877
COUPLE OF CLARIFICATIONS AND

03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:51.146
YOU HAD MENTIONED. THE SENATE

03:04:51.213 --> 03:04:52.581
BILL FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHERE

03:04:52.648 --> 03:04:54.316
WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR

03:04:54.383 --> 03:04:54.850
ON THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

03:04:54.917 --> 03:04:57.386
RECORDS ACT. THAT WE WANTED

03:04:57.453 --> 03:04:59.621
INFORMATION TO HELP. LAW

03:04:59.688 --> 03:05:03.225
ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABLE AND

03:05:03.292 --> 03:05:05.360
YOUR PREDECESSOR TOOK THE- I

03:05:05.427 --> 03:05:06.829
TOOK THE POSITION THAT I THINK

03:05:06.895 --> 03:05:08.397
I THINK INCORRECTLY THAT IT

03:05:08.464 --> 03:05:11.033
APPLIED ONLY TO CURRENT EVENTS

03:05:11.099 --> 03:05:13.669
OR TO FUTURE RECORDS AS OPPOSED

03:05:13.735 --> 03:05:15.070
TO REALLY GOING INTO THE DATA

03:05:15.137 --> 03:05:17.673
ABOUT POLICE MISCONDUCT BECAUSE

03:05:17.739 --> 03:05:18.273
THAT'S WHAT THE BILL WANTED TO

03:05:18.340 --> 03:05:20.776
DO. AND IT REALLY BEGS THE

03:05:20.843 --> 03:05:23.912
QUESTION. YOU NOW IF YOU GET

03:05:23.979 --> 03:05:25.681
THIS CONFIRMATION WILL BE IN

03:05:25.747 --> 03:05:27.816
DOING AN ADMINISTRATIVE ROLE WE

03:05:27.883 --> 03:05:29.418
BEING LEGISLATIVE AND NOT TO

03:05:29.485 --> 03:05:31.153
UNDERMINE. THE SEPARATION OF

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:34.022
POWERS HERE. BUT HOW HOW DO WE

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:36.658
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT THE LAWS

03:05:36.725 --> 03:05:38.126
THAT WE PASS AND WE FEEL ARE

03:05:38.193 --> 03:05:40.162
FAIRLY CLEAR. THAT WE CAN

03:05:40.229 --> 03:05:41.964
COMMUNICATE THAT WITH YOU AND I

03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:44.233
THINK IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING

03:05:44.299 --> 03:05:45.133
FOR US WHEN IN ADMINISTRATIVE

03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:48.303
DEPARTMENT. TAKES A COUNTER.

03:05:48.370 --> 03:05:51.440
INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTE

03:05:51.507 --> 03:05:52.341
NOT BASED ON THE WORDS OF THE

03:05:52.407 --> 03:05:55.477
STATUTE BUT IT'S WOULD BE BASED

03:05:55.544 --> 03:05:57.846
ON. ANOTHER DESIRE HOW DO WE

03:05:57.913 --> 03:06:02.851
SORT THAT. LET ME TRY TO ANSWER

03:06:02.918 --> 03:06:03.552
SPECIFICALLY FIRST AND

03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:06.154
GENERALLY SECOND WHEN IT COMES

03:06:06.221 --> 03:06:08.390
TO SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE. AS

03:06:08.457 --> 03:06:10.692
PART OF THAT BILL- IT WAS A

03:06:10.759 --> 03:06:12.094
BILL WHOSE LETTER AND INTENT

03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:13.462
WAS FOR DISCLOSURE OF

03:06:13.529 --> 03:06:14.696
ADDITIONAL PERSONAL RECORDS

03:06:14.763 --> 03:06:16.131
PERSON PURSUANT TO THAT THE

03:06:16.198 --> 03:06:20.002
CATEGORIES. ANIMATED IN THAT IN

03:06:20.068 --> 03:06:24.773
THAT LAW. AND. HI IF I HAVE THE

03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:26.508
HONOR OF BEING CONFIRMED I HOPE

03:06:26.575 --> 03:06:28.477
TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE ON THAT

03:06:28.544 --> 03:06:29.811
DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO LINE

03:06:29.878 --> 03:06:32.080
CARRY OUT THE LAW. THERE THERE

03:06:32.147 --> 03:06:33.715
WERE SOME. RUSSIANS ABOUT

03:06:33.782 --> 03:06:37.052
WHETHER. IT WAS APPLIED TO

03:06:37.119 --> 03:06:38.654
PROSPECTIVE RECORDS ONLY VERSUS

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:40.289
RETROSPECTIVE WHETHER IT

03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:43.358
APPLIED TO. DOCUMENTS THAT THAT

03:06:43.425 --> 03:06:46.128
WERE ARE CREATED- AN ACTUAL DOJ

03:06:46.194 --> 03:06:47.396
DOCUMENTS OR DOCUMENTS IN THE

03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:49.598
POSSESSION OF THE DOJ THAT WERE

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:50.399
THIRD PARTY DOCUMENTS THAT'S

03:06:50.465 --> 03:06:51.767
ALL CLEARED UP NOW AS I

03:06:51.833 --> 03:06:53.769
UNDERSTAND IT SO OR OR OR

03:06:53.835 --> 03:06:55.704
CLOSER TO DISCLOSURE. AND

03:06:55.771 --> 03:06:57.306
THAT'S THE INTENT OF THE BILL

03:06:57.372 --> 03:06:59.408
OF LAW AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL

03:06:59.474 --> 03:07:02.277
SEEK TO BE- PARTICIPATING IN

03:07:02.344 --> 03:07:04.746
DISCLOSING THE BILL'S PURSUANT

03:07:04.813 --> 03:07:06.181
TO THAT LAW. GENERALLY

03:07:06.248 --> 03:07:07.349
SOMETIMES WE WRITE BILLS AS

03:07:07.416 --> 03:07:10.485
LEGISLATORS AND I'VE DONE THIS-

03:07:10.552 --> 03:07:12.020
WHERE WE THINK WE HAVE A TAPE

03:07:12.087 --> 03:07:13.522
AND IT HAS ALL THE COMPONENTS

03:07:13.589 --> 03:07:15.090
OF THE GUIDANCE NEEDED AND THE

03:07:15.157 --> 03:07:16.458
SOMETHING THAT I JUST NEVER

03:07:16.525 --> 03:07:19.595
THOUGHT OF. AND WHEN THE AGENCY

03:07:19.661 --> 03:07:20.362
OR DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:22.831
IMPLEMENTING- SEES THE BILL

03:07:22.898 --> 03:07:23.966
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT AN

03:07:24.032 --> 03:07:24.866
ANTENNA CONSEQUENCE OR

03:07:24.933 --> 03:07:26.602
AMBIGUITY OR LACK OF CLARITY I

03:07:26.668 --> 03:07:28.670
THINK I HOPE I BELIEVE THAT WE

03:07:28.737 --> 03:07:30.706
CAN AVOID THAT. IF WE'RE

03:07:30.772 --> 03:07:33.342
ENGAGED EARLIER MEANING IF THE

03:07:33.408 --> 03:07:34.076
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S

03:07:34.142 --> 03:07:36.411
LEGISLATIVE TEAM ARE WORKING

03:07:36.478 --> 03:07:38.146
WITH LEGISLATORS CARRYING BILLS

03:07:38.213 --> 03:07:39.281
THAT IMPACT APARTMENT JUSTICE

03:07:39.348 --> 03:07:42.117
TO- YOU KNOW PROVIDE INPUT TO

03:07:42.184 --> 03:07:43.318
PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS TO POINT

03:07:43.385 --> 03:07:44.920
OUT AREAS THAT COULD CREATE

03:07:44.987 --> 03:07:46.388
THAT AND BEGIN AMBIGUITY OR

03:07:46.455 --> 03:07:47.556
THAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES

03:07:47.623 --> 03:07:48.590
THAT WE HAVE PUT IT ON THE

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:52.260
FRONT END. INSTEAD OF BEING

03:07:52.327 --> 03:07:53.695
FRUSTRATED ON THE BACKEND.

03:07:53.762 --> 03:07:54.496
NINETY AND I APPRECIATE THAT IN

03:07:54.563 --> 03:07:57.566
AND- YOU DID RIGHT GOOD ANSWER

03:07:57.633 --> 03:07:59.534
ON ON SPECIFICALLY THE FOURTEEN

03:07:59.601 --> 03:08:00.168
TWENTY ONE BUT IS USING THAT IS

03:08:00.235 --> 03:08:01.970
A BIT OF AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I

03:08:02.037 --> 03:08:03.905
THINK IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. THE

03:08:03.972 --> 03:08:07.376
PREDECESSOR. I WANTED AN

03:08:07.442 --> 03:08:09.745
OUTCOME. BUT WAS FRUSTRATING

03:08:09.811 --> 03:08:11.446
ULTIMATELY TO WHAT THE PURPOSE

03:08:11.513 --> 03:08:13.515
OF DISCLOSURE. AND

03:08:13.582 --> 03:08:16.151
TRANSPARENCY. THAT WAS EMBODIED

03:08:16.218 --> 03:08:18.587
IN IN IN THE BILL AND I WANT TO

03:08:18.654 --> 03:08:19.621
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FIGURE

03:08:19.688 --> 03:08:22.991
OUT. WAYS TO OVERCOME THOSE.

03:08:23.058 --> 03:08:25.227
THOSE DIFFERENCES I HAVE BEEN

03:08:25.293 --> 03:08:27.729
CHASTISED BY JUDGES. WHO TELL

03:08:27.796 --> 03:08:28.797
US THAT OUR JOB IS TO WRITE

03:08:28.864 --> 03:08:30.932
CLEAR LAW YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN

03:08:30.999 --> 03:08:32.768
TO THEM. THAT'S NOT REALLY OUR

03:08:32.834 --> 03:08:34.803
JOB OUR JOB IS TO PASS THE LAW

03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:37.272
THAT THE BEST WAY WE CAN. GIVEN

03:08:37.339 --> 03:08:38.807
THE DYNAMICS THIRTY PEOPLE TO

03:08:38.874 --> 03:08:40.208
SIT ON THE SCHOOL. AND WE ARE

03:08:40.275 --> 03:08:42.577
NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE AS CLEAR

03:08:42.644 --> 03:08:43.645
AND WE ARE GOING TO NEGOTIATE

03:08:43.712 --> 03:08:45.280
OVER SOME VERY SPECIFIC SO YOUR

03:08:45.347 --> 03:08:48.650
POINT IS WELL TAKEN. THAT THE

03:08:48.717 --> 03:08:50.352
ULTIMATE THE INTERPRETATION WAR

03:08:50.419 --> 03:08:51.420
SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

03:08:51.486 --> 03:08:54.056
COMPLETELY CLEAR AS WE

03:08:54.122 --> 03:08:54.890
NEGOTIATE PRETTY HEAVILY SOME

03:08:54.956 --> 03:08:56.491
OF THESE BILLS. CAN BE A

03:08:56.558 --> 03:08:59.494
CHALLENGE BUT I HOPE THAT GIVEN

03:08:59.561 --> 03:09:00.562
YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR

03:09:00.629 --> 03:09:02.397
PROCESSES AND WHAT WE DO. THAT

03:09:02.464 --> 03:09:03.565
WE CAN HAVE SOME LINES OF

03:09:03.632 --> 03:09:04.700
COMMUNICATION TO CLEAR THINGS

03:09:04.766 --> 03:09:07.102
UP. SO THAT THERE'S NOT ALL TO

03:09:07.169 --> 03:09:09.004
MILLION FRUSTRATION. AT THE END

03:09:09.071 --> 03:09:11.707
ON THE ISSUE OF. PUBLIC TRUST

03:09:11.773 --> 03:09:12.908
KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

03:09:12.974 --> 03:09:13.875
THINGS IN THIS IS SOMETHING

03:09:13.942 --> 03:09:16.845
THAT. THAT IS IMPORTANT THAT.

03:09:16.912 --> 03:09:18.213
AND WHEN THE QUESTIONS THAT

03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:19.214
THAT I. **** I THINK THAT

03:09:19.281 --> 03:09:21.950
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT

03:09:22.017 --> 03:09:22.484
THAT IS DEVELOPED OVER THE

03:09:22.551 --> 03:09:24.920
YEARS. AND THAT IS WITH LOCAL

03:09:24.986 --> 03:09:26.822
DJS AND EVEN WITH THE ATTORNEY

03:09:26.888 --> 03:09:29.224
GENERAL'S OFFICE. TAKING

03:09:29.291 --> 03:09:33.161
CAMPAIGN MONEY AS IS.

03:09:33.228 --> 03:09:35.964
TRADITIONAL FROM ORGANIZATIONS

03:09:36.031 --> 03:09:38.567
IN AND FOR US BECAUSE OF OUR

03:09:38.633 --> 03:09:40.635
LEGISLATIVE ROLE THERE'S NOT

03:09:40.702 --> 03:09:42.337
NECESSARILY A DIRECT AS AS

03:09:42.404 --> 03:09:44.439
DIRECTOR CONNECTION GOOD FOR

03:09:44.506 --> 03:09:46.641
DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR FOR EVEN

03:09:46.708 --> 03:09:48.677
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVING

03:09:48.744 --> 03:09:49.978
SPECIFIC DISCIPLINARY

03:09:50.045 --> 03:09:52.414
RESPONSIBILITY OVER A GROUP

03:09:52.481 --> 03:09:54.349
THAT IS GIVING CAMPAIGN

03:09:54.416 --> 03:09:56.718
CONTRIBUTIONS I THINK THIS

03:09:56.785 --> 03:09:58.386
POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST

03:09:58.453 --> 03:09:59.788
AND I JUST WANNA GET YOUR TAKE

03:09:59.855 --> 03:10:02.357
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT DO YOU.

03:10:02.424 --> 03:10:05.761
DISAGREE WITH THAT. AS I

03:10:05.827 --> 03:10:06.695
MENTIONED EARLIER I REALLY

03:10:06.762 --> 03:10:08.330
BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THAT THAT

03:10:08.396 --> 03:10:09.731
THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PRESSING

03:10:09.798 --> 03:10:11.433
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS

03:10:11.500 --> 03:10:12.834
WHEN IT COMES TO LAW

03:10:12.901 --> 03:10:14.035
ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES

03:10:14.102 --> 03:10:14.703
BUILDING THAT TRUST BACK

03:10:14.770 --> 03:10:16.505
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND

03:10:16.571 --> 03:10:22.477
OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THE BILL-

03:10:22.544 --> 03:10:24.880
THE CONCEPT THAT YOU REFER TO.

03:10:24.946 --> 03:10:27.549
SPECIFICALLY THAT A DISTRICT

03:10:27.616 --> 03:10:29.084
ATTORNEY WHO HAS CRIMINAL

03:10:29.151 --> 03:10:31.119
CHARGING POWER THAT IS VERY

03:10:31.186 --> 03:10:33.388
UNIQUE AMONG ELECTED OFFICIALS.

03:10:33.455 --> 03:10:34.189
IF THEY RECEIVE A CAMPAIGN

03:10:34.256 --> 03:10:35.357
CONTRIBUTION FROM A POLICE

03:10:35.423 --> 03:10:37.659
UNION AND THEN ARE RESPONSIBLE

03:10:37.726 --> 03:10:39.127
FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF A

03:10:39.194 --> 03:10:40.562
MEMBER OF THE POLICE UNION A

03:10:40.629 --> 03:10:43.899
POLICE OFFICER- THEN THEY CAN-

03:10:43.965 --> 03:10:46.101
EITHER NOT. WE CAN PROCEED WITH

03:10:46.168 --> 03:10:46.802
THE INVESTIGATION IF THEY'RE

03:10:46.868 --> 03:10:49.171
NOT TAKING- DIVERSITY CAMPAIGN

03:10:49.237 --> 03:10:50.438
CONTRIBUTION OR THEY WOULD BE

03:10:50.505 --> 03:10:54.075
RECUSED IF THEY WERE- IF

03:10:54.142 --> 03:10:55.143
ACCEPTING THAT CONTRIBUTION I

03:10:55.210 --> 03:10:56.912
THINK THAT THAT WAS A PROPOSAL

03:10:56.978 --> 03:10:59.915
THAT I- CAME FORWARD WITH. TO

03:10:59.981 --> 03:11:01.016
HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

03:11:01.082 --> 03:11:03.151
REBUILDING COMMUNITY TRUST

03:11:03.218 --> 03:11:03.952
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE

03:11:04.019 --> 03:11:05.520
COMMUNITY I'VE HAD. PEOPLE COME

03:11:05.587 --> 03:11:07.823
UP TO ME AND SAY. HOW CAN THEY

03:11:07.889 --> 03:11:08.790
BE A MAKE AN OBJECTIVE

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:10.625
DECISION. ON THIS ON THIS

03:11:10.692 --> 03:11:12.961
POLICE OFFICER. ON WHETHER THEY

03:11:13.028 --> 03:11:17.332
USED EXCESSIVE FORCE OR- YOU

03:11:17.399 --> 03:11:19.768
KNOW- YOU KNOW VIOLATED EIGHTY

03:11:19.835 --> 03:11:21.136
TO NINETY TWO. WHEN THAT WHEN

03:11:21.203 --> 03:11:22.504
THAT UNION HAS GIVEN A

03:11:22.571 --> 03:11:23.338
CONTRIBUTION TO THAT DISTRICT

03:11:23.405 --> 03:11:25.607
ATTORNEY AND SO. THAT WAS A

03:11:25.674 --> 03:11:26.374
CLEAR INDICATION TO ME THAT

03:11:26.441 --> 03:11:30.145
THAT TRUST IS MISSING. AND MY

03:11:30.212 --> 03:11:30.712
HOPE IS THAT THAT BILL WOULD

03:11:30.779 --> 03:11:31.813
HELP RESTORE THAT TRUST. AND I

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:34.182
AGREE AND I KNOW YOU GOT WE GOT

03:11:34.249 --> 03:11:36.351
SOME PUSH BACK. FROM THE

03:11:36.418 --> 03:11:38.153
ATTORNEY GENERAL ON THAT SO I

03:11:38.220 --> 03:11:40.522
AM GLAD. THAT YOU ARE PROPOSED

03:11:40.589 --> 03:11:42.057
FOR THIS POSITION UNDERSTAND

03:11:42.123 --> 03:11:43.792
THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT

03:11:43.859 --> 03:11:47.329
IS CLEAR IT DOES NOT MESS IN MY

03:11:47.395 --> 03:11:47.963
VIEW DOES NOT MEAN THAT THERE'S

03:11:48.029 --> 03:11:49.264
A CONFLICT. THAT POTENTIAL

03:11:49.331 --> 03:11:52.667
CONFLICTS. AND ACTUAL CONFLICT

03:11:52.734 --> 03:11:55.871
SOMETIMES THAT DRIVES OUTCOMES.

03:11:55.937 --> 03:11:58.673
IS DETRIMENTAL TO BUILDING

03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:00.508
TRUST CONFIDENCE KIND OF ACROSS

03:12:00.575 --> 03:12:02.844
THE BOARD- AND THEN IN MY FINAL

03:12:02.911 --> 03:12:05.046
COMMENT TO IT IN I KNOW YOU

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:06.314
UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE THIS IS

03:12:06.381 --> 03:12:07.282
BEEN RAISED A LITTLE BITON THE

03:12:07.349 --> 03:12:09.885
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE

03:12:09.951 --> 03:12:10.518
CALIFORNIA THIS IS SOMETHING WE

03:12:10.585 --> 03:12:12.320
STRUGGLED WITH. QUITE A BIT I

03:12:12.387 --> 03:12:14.289
THINK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS LED

03:12:14.356 --> 03:12:15.991
THE NATION FOR DECADES ON

03:12:16.057 --> 03:12:17.993
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

03:12:18.059 --> 03:12:19.995
ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT. I

03:12:20.061 --> 03:12:21.429
THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S.

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:23.398
OFFICE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB ON

03:12:23.465 --> 03:12:24.666
ENVIRONMENTAL FOR-

03:12:24.733 --> 03:12:27.602
ENVIRONMENTAL. ENFORCEMENT OF

03:12:27.669 --> 03:12:31.172
OUR LAWS HOWEVER THE PIECE THAT

03:12:31.239 --> 03:12:33.775
IS REALLY THE TO ME THE NEXT

03:12:33.842 --> 03:12:35.377
GENERATION STEP THAT WE NEED TO

03:12:35.443 --> 03:12:37.746
TAKE IS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:12:37.812 --> 03:12:39.514
BECAUSE IF WE JUST ENFORCE THE

03:12:39.581 --> 03:12:40.515
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THE WAY WE

03:12:40.582 --> 03:12:43.184
HAVE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE LEAVING

03:12:43.251 --> 03:12:45.787
COMMUNITIES BEHIND. AND YET IN

03:12:45.854 --> 03:12:47.389
AGGREGATE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN

03:12:47.455 --> 03:12:49.958
AIR CLEAN WATER ARE EXEMPLARY

03:12:50.025 --> 03:12:51.860
BUT IF YOU DRILL DOWN AND LOOK

03:12:51.927 --> 03:12:53.628
AT SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT IS

03:12:53.695 --> 03:12:56.765
NOT THE CASE. SO WHAT I'M

03:12:56.831 --> 03:12:58.633
HOPING IS THAT INSTEAD SHE

03:12:58.700 --> 03:12:59.801
GIVEN YOUR EXPERTISE YOUR

03:12:59.868 --> 03:13:02.804
BACKGROUND AND YOUR SENSITIVITY

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:04.739
TO SEE ISSUES. IS THAT. THAT'S

03:13:04.806 --> 03:13:06.741
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE WHAT HAS

03:13:06.808 --> 03:13:08.376
BEEN EXEMPLARY ENVIRONMENTAL

03:13:08.443 --> 03:13:11.046
ENFORCEMENT. AND RECAST IT AS

03:13:11.112 --> 03:13:14.115
NECESSARY AS IS NECESSARY WITH

03:13:14.182 --> 03:13:15.350
MORE OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL

03:13:15.417 --> 03:13:17.619
JUSTICE LANDS SO THAT THAT

03:13:17.686 --> 03:13:19.554
BECOMES WHAT THE ENFORCEMENT

03:13:19.621 --> 03:13:22.624
MECHANISM THE PRIMARY DRIVER TO

03:13:22.691 --> 03:13:24.092
BEHIND THE FORCING MECHANISM

03:13:24.159 --> 03:13:26.127
BECAUSE I THINK TAT IS. A LONG

03:13:26.194 --> 03:13:29.764
STANDING DEFICIT IN HOW WE HAVE

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:31.766
VIEWED ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ALL

03:13:31.833 --> 03:13:33.034
THE TIME THOSE COMMUNITIES OF

03:13:33.101 --> 03:13:35.170
LOS AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

03:13:35.236 --> 03:13:37.872
LOSE SO I AM JUST ASKING THAT

03:13:37.939 --> 03:13:41.509
YOU WHICH YOU HAVE SAID BUT

03:13:41.576 --> 03:13:42.077
THIS IS I THINK A VERY VERY

03:13:42.143 --> 03:13:44.913
IMPORTANT. ISSUE THAT THAT WE

03:13:44.980 --> 03:13:46.681
LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

03:13:46.748 --> 03:13:48.783
ESPECIALLY BERMAN FORTRESS-

03:13:48.850 --> 03:13:49.884
DEPARTMENTAL ENFORCEMENT

03:13:49.951 --> 03:13:53.121
THROUGH THAT EQUITY LENS

03:13:53.188 --> 03:13:54.689
THROUGH THAT JUSTICE LET.

03:13:54.756 --> 03:13:56.024
BECAUSE I THINK THAT LEADS US

03:13:56.091 --> 03:13:57.258
TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS AND

03:13:57.325 --> 03:13:58.360
POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT

03:13:58.426 --> 03:14:03.698
PRIORITIES IF. 100% YEAH GOOD

03:14:03.765 --> 03:14:05.834
AND I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE

03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:07.769
LEADERSHIP INTHIS HOUSE- YOU

CRISTINA GARCIA EDUARDO GARCIA

03:14:15.410 --> 03:14:16.845
WE HAVE REALLY PUT A STAKE IN

03:14:16.911 --> 03:14:18.313
THE GROUND ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:14:18.380 --> 03:14:19.547
NOT JUST DEFENDING PROTECTING

03:14:19.614 --> 03:14:20.448
OUR ENVIRONMENT AS YOU

03:14:20.515 --> 03:14:21.116

POVERTY POLLUTION DISADVANTAGED

03:14:26.021 --> 03:14:26.454
COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE

03:14:26.521 --> 03:14:30.458
COMMUNITIES ARE SEEN AND

03:14:30.525 --> 03:14:32.160

WHY IT WASN'T REALLY A

03:14:55.717 --> 03:14:57.886
QUESTION. BUT I. AM JUST

03:14:57.952 --> 03:14:59.888
