THIRTEEN WILL EXTEND THE SUNSET OF A PILOT PROGRAM IN NAPA AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES ALLOWING LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION SLAPPED GOES TO AUTHORIZE CITY OR DISTRICT SERVICE OUTSIDE URBAN BOUNDARIES. I'LL BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. MY AB FOUR OH TWO FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- ESTABLISHED A PILOT PROGRAM IN THAT BUT SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES ALLOWING A LOT GO TO AUTHORIZE CITY OR DISTRICT TO PROVIDE SERVICES OUTSIDE ITS- BOUNDARIES IT'S FEARFUL IT'S TO SERVE. EXISTING OR PLANNED USE LAND USES AS LONG AS THE EXTENSION WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT AGRICULTURE OPEN SPACE. GIVEN THE PUBLIC BENEFITS AFFORDED BY THE PILOT PROGRAM IN BOTH COUNTIES AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THESE COUNTIES WILL AGAIN REQUIRE THE FLEXIBILITY AFFORDED BY THE PILOT PROGRAM. IT'S APPROPRIATE TO EXTEND THE PROVISIONS OF AB FOUR OH TWO UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SIX. ADDITIONALLY S. B. THIRTEEN ADDS A LIMITED- AUTHORIZATION FOR LAP DAPPLE LAUGH GO TO ALLOW SEWER EXTENSION BY THE CITY OF SEEN ALINA WHAT THE PURPOSES OF BRING IMPORTANT. ENVIRONMENTAL AND HOUSING BENEFITS INCLUDING SERVING FARM WORKER HOUSING. APART APPROVAL FOR NAPOL LAUGH GO THE SEWER EXTENSION WOULD WE SERVE FUTURE FARM WORKER HOUSING UNITS IN THE REDEVELOPMENT OF FORMER MOBILE HOME PARK IT TOO AVAILABLE SHORT TERM RENTAL HOUSING UNITS. LOCAL CONTROLS PRESERVED AS A CITY COUNTY IN LIFE GO WOULD ALL NEED TO APPROVE THESE PROJECTS. ON THE PHONE TODAY IN SUPPORT IS SUPERVISOR DIANE DILLON ON BEHALF OF NAPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND NAPA LASKO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH- MYSTERY OF US USE ME OPERATOR CAN WE PLEASE GET THE SUPERVISOR DYLAN ON THE LINE. THANK YOU HAVE LINE IS OPEN. HELLO THIS IS BRIAN DILLON NAPA COUNTY SUPERVISOR- CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE NAPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THE NAPOLI LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION THAT BELASCO WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN AND WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR DOCTORS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THE COUNTY AND NAPA LAUGHTER STRONG SUPPORT FIRST WE HAVE LONG STANDING LAND USE ORDINANCES TO HELP PREVENT URBAN SPRAWL AND PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES BY DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO INCREASE THE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT FIFTY THREE YEARS AGO WE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE SPENDING DESTINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. SPEND FAN NAPA COUNTY HAS CONTINUOUSLY BEEN GUIDED BY TWO COMPLEMENTARY PRINCIPAL. AGRICULTURAL LAND SHOULD BE PROTECTED. DEVELOPMENT SHOULD OCCUR AND URBAN AREAS ALSO KNOWN AS CITY CENTER GROWTH. THIS PILOT PROGRAM WOULD NOT DISTURB THOSE GUIDING CANNOT AND IN FACT WOULD REINFORCE THEM AND THAT'S BECAUSE OUR SECOND ESSENTIAL REASON FOR SUPPORTING SB THIRTEEN RELATES TO HOW IT CAN HELP PROPERTY OWNERS AND THE AGRICULTURAL THEN. CREATE MORE AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEE HOUSING DISTRICT PURSUANT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION ONE SEVEN ZERO TWO ONE POINT EIGHT THE COST OF BUILDING SIX HOUSING INCLUDE ADEQUATE WELL WATER AND SEPTIC SYSTEM IF YOU'RE OUT ON AGRICULTURAL LAND REDUCING THESE COSTS BY MAKING THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCESSING PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER SYSTEM. WILL ADD AN INCENTIVE TO BUILD AND- NOT MAKE THE PLANS HAVE TO COME INTO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT TO GET ANNEXED SO IT'S LIKE A SELF DEFEATING- SITUATION AND DEFEATS THE PURPOSE THAT THE AG'S MOUNTING. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WERE VERY PROUD NAPA COUNTY AND NAPA LASKO TO SUPPORT SB THIRTEEN AND THANK SENATOR DODD VERY MUCH FOR OFFERING IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUPERVISOR LET'S MOVE ON TO ARE THERE ANY OTHER- WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. THIRTY ONE HERE IN THE ON A TWO C. NONE. LET'S MOVE ON TO HAVE AN OFFICE PAMELA MILLER FROM CAL LEFT CO. OPERATOR WE COULD SPEAK TO MISS MILLER. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PAMELA MILLER AND I'M REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION. GALLAGHER HAS TAKEN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB THIRTEEN BASED ON THE APRIL TWENTY NINTH AMENDMENT. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING SENATOR DODD AND HIS STAFF AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US. AS WELL AS WITH NAFTA AND CAME IN AND YOU KNOW LAST CODES ON THE BILL. I ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE SENATOR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN CRAFTING EIGHTY FOUR OH TWO WHICH CREATED THE PILOT PROGRAM. A TELESCOPE DOES NOT OPPOSE THE PROGRAM I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT WE DO NOT OPPOSE THAT- GRANT. IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM NO DO NOR DO WE OPPOSE IT BEING EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. THAT'S NOTED AND THE ANALYSIS AND IN BOTH LAST COACH REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE. ARE UTILIZING THE PROGRAM FOR ITS ORIGINAL INTENDED PURPOSE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE RECENT AMENDMENT ADDING FIVE SIX ONE THREE THREE POINT SIX TO THE SPECIFIC BENEFITTED THINK CLEAN IS WHAT QALAAT CODE DOES NOT THE COURT AND WE ARE REQUESTING ITS REMOVAL. H. AS IN ELEPHANT DUNG BY YOUR STAFF POINTS OUT THE CAREFULLY CRAFTED PILOT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTY FOUR OH TWO ONE POINT EIGHT TO ALLOW EXTENSION OF SERVICE. EXISTING OR PLANNED USES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN A GENERAL OR SPECIFIC PLANS AS OF JULY FIRST TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH IS EXPLICITLY. DEFINED IN THE CURRENT STATUTE. THE OF THIS. ACTS A- THE REQUIREMENT OF EXISTING OR PLANNED USE. THEIR BY POTENTIALLY ALLOWING APPROVAL OF THE EXTENSION OF SERVICE FOR NEW USES AND NEW DEVELOPMENT- AND SO IF WE UNDERSTAND THE CITY OF FRANKLIN AS A FULL COULD FARMWORKERS HOUSING AND REDEVELOPMENT OF A MOBILE HOME PARK AT MAIN COULD SHORT TERM RENTALS. THE FACT THAT THERE IS STILL SOME QUESTION AND DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE IS CONSIDERED NEW OR EXISTING- IN FIFTEEN HAS REYES A THREE. TERM FOR US. WE BELIEVE THAT IF IN FACT THE PARCELS NOTED AND FIVE SIX ONE THREE THREE POINT SIX ARE INCLUDED IN A PRESS SPECIFIC PLAN AFTER. SEVEN ONE FIFTEEN THE MAP ALASKA CANADA AT THE APPLICATIONS FOR EXTENSION OF SERVICE FOR THOSE PERSONAL. WITHIN THE EXISTING LANGUAGE. THE NEW SUBSECTION WE BELIEVE CREATES A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR PROVING EXTENSION SERVICE. AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF NEW USERS OUTSIDE THE CITY'S JURISDICTION. WHICH IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE INTENT OF EXISTING OR PLANNED YOU. AND FURTHER IT CREATES A CONFLICT WITHIN THE STATUTE ITSELF IN TERMS OF LAUGHTER MISSION OF ENSURING EARLY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AROUND POTENTIAL APPROVAL OF SUCH AN EXTENSION OF SERVICE TO PARCEL. FOR WHICH SPECIFICALLY IT HAS YET TO BE IDENTIFIED- ON WHICH NEW DEVELOPMENT OR NEW UNITS WILL OCCUR IT'S NOT IN THE SPIRIT FOR WHICH THE PILOT PROGRAMS IN EIGHTY FOUR OH TWO WITH THE DALLAS. AGAIN I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE DON'T OPPOSE THE EXTENSION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM AND INTENSELY USED BY BOTH NAPA AND SAMPOERNA DINO LASKO. AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THE REMOVAL OF SUBSECTION FIVE SIX ONE THREE THREE POINT SIX FOR THE REASONS I'VE SHARED THANK YOU SO MUCH.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS APPRECIATED THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'LL GO TO NUMBER ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. B. THREE FORCE HUESO WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR TODAY THE SIX TO PROTECT THE FISCAL SOLVENCY OF CALIFORNIA CITIES BY ALLOWING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE NEGOTIATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEBT ACCRUED THROUGH THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES SOME CITIES IN OUR IN OUR STATES STILL HAVE. DEBTS THAT THEY'VE BEEN ACCRUED MANY OF THOSE ENTERED INTO PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTIES TO IN MANY CASES SOMETIMES FUNNEL MONEY INTO- COUNTIES AND CITIES THROUGH- CREATIVE FINANCING SCHEMES HOWEVER. MANY OF THEM- JUST VERY PLAINLY HAD AGREEMENTS. THAT COULD BE RENEGOTIATED THERE'S- SOME- SPECULATION OR AT LEAST SOME OPINIONS THAT BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO ALLOW. COUNTIES AND CITIES SOME THAT ARE WE WILLING TO DO THAT WILLINGLY TO GO INTO AGREEMENTS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY ARE. LEGALLY ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND TO THE CURSED PRINCESS- CITY LAWS. SO WITHOUT THIS BILL THE REQUIRED STATUTORY AUTHORITY IS ABSENT AND COUNTIES ARE HINDERED IN THEIR ABILITY TO RESTRUCTURE OR PROVIDE RELIEF FROM EXORBITANT EXORBITANTTHAT TO MUNICIPALITIES SOMETIMES EXTENDING THE REPAYMENT DATE OR SOMETIMES- RICK RE- ORGANIZING THE WAY THE DEBT IS PAID THIS COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED. IF OTHER THIS BILLWOULD ALLOW IT SO- IN IN EIGHT NINETEEN AN EXAMPLE OF THIS- THAT MEANT. I HOPE CAN BE- PROVIDE SHED SOME LIGHT INTO WY WE NEED THIS BILL IN NINETEEN NINETY THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEGOTIATED A PASSED THROUGH AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND CONSOLIDATED FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT IN IN THE- OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FORTY EIGHT POINT 9% OF THE RTA'S REVENUE PASSED THROUGH THE COUNTY. AND FIFTEEN POINT 5% TO THE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT. BACK THEN THAT WAS LEGAL AND BACK THEN AND CURRENTLY IS STILL- COVERED UNDER THE- THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE R. D. A. USE THE REMAINING 35% OF THE FUNDS WHEN RDAS WERE DEFENDED DISBANDED BY THE COURTS. OF COURSE THIS PUT AN ONEROUS- WAIT ON THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPAY OR TO CONTINUE TO PAY THAT CONTRACT SO- DOES CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK IS REACHING RESELL TIGHTLY COUNTY AND THEY'VE BEEN. CONTEMPLATING A RESTRUCTURING BUT UNDER THE CURRENT STATE LAWS THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED SO THIS WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW. CITIES AND COUNTIES TO SIT AT THE TABLE DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO IT DOESN'T INSTRUCT THEM TO IT DOESN'T MAKE THIS PROCESS IN ANY WAY MANDATORY IS JUST SIMPLY. A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS CITIES AND COUNTIES TO SIT AT THE TABLE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT AND RENEGOTIATE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT THIS LAW WOULD JUST SIMPLY MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND TO HELP. A CITIES- BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS EVERY SINGLE YEAR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR LET'S MOVE ON YOU HAVE I BELIEVE TWO PEOPLE IN SUPPORT ARNOLD ALTURAS LAWSON FROM CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK ON THE PHONE AND STEVE CARMONA OF THE CITY PICO RIVERA ON THE PHONE. OPERATOR. ARNOLD IS NOT I DO NOT SEE STEVE YET. WE CAN START WITH MR GLASSMAN. YES THAT THANKS VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS ARNOLD ALBERS GLASSMAN I AM THE CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO OUR POSITION TODAY IN THE TWENTY TWELVE ACTIONS TAKEN WHICH RESULTED IN THE- LAMINATION OF PRE DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER SUCH ACTION HAD A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT UPON MANY CITIES WHO HAVE EXISTING PAT FACT THE PASTOR WILL BRING ITS- AND IMPORTANTLY. A KEY SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO REPAY THE OBLIGATIONS INCURRED BY THOSE PASSED THROUGH YOUR CREMINS. THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAS RESULTED IN MANY CITIES BEING LEFT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS. CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK WHO SUPPORT THIS BILL IS AN EXAMPLE OF COMMITTEES JUST LIKE YOURS. WHO UNDER S. B. SEVEN THIRTY FOUR WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE A METHOD OF ACHIEVING FINANCIAL RELIEF FROM THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED IN THE PAST REMAINS WILL ALSO ALLOW THE POSSIBLE REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL ALL THE- BY THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. AND ALLOW CITIES AND COUNTIES TO REACH- TO RESULT IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RELIEF AND RECOVERY. CURRENTLY UNDER THE PASTOR AGREEMENT NINETEEN PARK I NEED TO MARCOS THAT PRACTICALLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE HIGH RATE OF INTEREST RATES. THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR LEVEL FIELD NEGOTIATIONS TO REDUCE THOSE AMOUNTS BY UP 225% INTRODUCTION INTEREST RATES FROM THE RANGE OF 7% OR MORE DOWN TO ZERO. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY JUST STOP CITIES AND TO PROTECT THOSE WHO PAY THEIR TAXES DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIMES. WE BELIEVE THAT SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR IS A BALANCED APPROACH IS A GOOD START AND A MUCH NEEDED COURSE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS A FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TWO HUNDRED THESE PASSED THROUGH REMATCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE AND I BOTH FOR SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR THANK-YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IS MISTER CARMONA ON THE LINE YET. I DO NOT THINK I'M DOUBTING YET.

WE'VE OVER THE YEARS ENTERED INTO SEVERAL PATH TO AGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY OF ALLEGHENY AND WE CURRENTLY OWE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH NEARLY ONE THIRD REPRESENTING INTEREST. I AN UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE ON THE STAT FROM OUR CURRENT DEBT DOWN TO ZERO. BUT WILL IT AFFECT 25% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING DEFERRED PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS OWED. BY THE FORMER RDA AND THE- AGENCY TO ATTACK TO THAT TAXING ENTITY. IN ADDITION THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF CAST AN UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO RENEGOTIATE PLEDGE PROPERTY TAXES SALES TAXES. AND ANY OTHER- REVENUE SOURCES AT TOWARDS REPAYMENT OF THE COMPOUNDING AND DECADES OLD DEFERRED OBLIGATIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO STRUCTURE THE EXISTING OBLIGATION IN AN EQUITABLE WAY AND ENSURE THAT WE CAN- YOU KNOW. GIVE YOU ATTENTION TO THE INVESTMENT IN AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY.

LACKEY I BLOOM BLOOM I'M BOERNER HORVATH FOR I ROLES RIGHT RAMOS SIDE THREE OF US. THREE OF US I ROBERT REED. WEBER OKAY. WILL TELL HI EIGHT ZERO. EIGHT YOUR BILLS NOTHING YOU THANK YOU MUCH SINCE HER GOOD AFTERNOON THAT AFTERNOON OKAY ALL THOSE WHO DISTRICT MORE NO. I WILL GO TO THE JUMPED IN I DON'T KNOW EIGHT SB FOUR SO SIX SENATOR MEN. RUSSIAN PROCEED MENTOR YES PLEASE DO. SO MUCH IN THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU SO MUCH NICE TO MEET SOME OF YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME NICE TO SEE OTHERS- MANAGER I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THOUGHTFUL DIALOGUE THAT YOU AND I'VE HAD AND THAT OUR STAFF HAVE HAD IN CONSULTATION ON THIS BILL- UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE CAMINO SIS AND I WANNA EXPLAIN WHY- IS- YOU WE'VE TRIED TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION REPEATEDLY ON THIS BILL. ARE FUNDAMENTALLY WE'RE A DIFFERENT POSITION- I BELIEVE MY STAFF POLICE AND OUR SPONSORS BELIEVE. THAT THE PACE PROGRAM IS RIFE WITH FRAUD THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS REFORM. THAT WE SEE TOO MUCH IN BEAUCE AND THAT THE FRAMERS AND SENATE AND INCENTIVES BUILT INTO THE PACE PROGRAM. ARE FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED PUTTING VULNERABLE HOMEOWNERS INCLUDING LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS ELDERLY AND MINORITIES AT RISK. ARE THE OPPOSITION IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT AND SO THIS GETS TO THE CRUX OF OUR BILL BUT I BELIEVE THE AUDIT THAT WE PROPOSE AND SOMETHING THAT WE I WILL DISCUSS. HAVE REPEATEDLY TRIED TO SCALE DOWN- IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING THE ABUSES WE ARE SEEING IN PACE FINANCING. A LOT HAS BEEN DONE TO IMPROVE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN CASE BUT THE CURRENT MODEL ALLOWS FOR PRACTICES WE KNOW ARE HARMFUL TO CONSUMERS. DOOR TO DOOR SALES SAME DAY CONTRACTS NO INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF PROPOSED UPGRADES NO VERIFICATION OF WORK BEING COMPLETED BEFORE PAYMENTS ARE PROCESSED. PAGE CONTRACTORS WHO GENERALLY HAVE NO FINANCIAL TRAINING. IT'S HOMEOWNERS IT'S COMPLICATED FINANCIAL PRODUCT AND HAVE A PERVASIVE INCENTIVE TO UP SELL. THE CURRENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY DISRUPT THIS INCENTIVE. INSTEAD OF MAKING CLEAR TO HOMEOWNERS THAT PACE FINANCING WILL PACE PLACE A SUPER PRIORITY LIEN ON THEIR HOME CONTRACTORS TYPICALLY AND TOO OFTEN PITCH PACE AS A GOVERNMENT APPROVED PROGRAM. THAT REQUIRES NO MONEY DOWN. THE KEY SELLING POINT MADE TO CONSUMERS IS THAT PACE FINANCED HOME IMPROVEMENTS WILL PAY FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH ENERGY COST SAVINGS. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT PACE INDUSTRY SHOULD WELCOME THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF AN UP FRONT SCALED DOWN ENERGY ASSESSMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WE KNOW THIS BUSINESS MODEL WE'VE HEARD COUNTLESS STORIES OF FRAUD ABUSE AND WHILE SOME OF YOU HAVE ASKED FOR DATA WE DON'T HAVE THAT IT'S NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WE DO KNOW THAT CONSUMER ADVOCATES INCLUDING THE ONES THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM. I HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD US THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP AREAS OF CONSUMER FRAUD THAT THEY HEAR ABOUT. HOMEOWNER PROMISED ENERGY SAVINGS THAT MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. AND POTATO PATCH UPGRADES THEY MAY NOT NEED AND THEN LEFT ON THE HOOK. AFTER THE CONTRACTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS HAVE MADE THEIR PROFITS. SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX WOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HEAD ON BY REQUIRING A QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY TO PERFORM AN ENERGY AUDIT TO ENSURE THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE HOME WILL REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. AND FOSSIL FUELS USE. A HOME ENERGY ASSESSMENT ARMS TO HOMEOWNERS WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ENERGY USE IN THEIR HOME THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY ABOUT TO UNDERTAKE FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLD. ENERGY AUDITS ARE COMMON AND REQUIRED FOR OTHER ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS INCLUDING CPUC SINGLE FAMILY AFFORDABLE SOLAR HOMES PROGRAM. AND ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AS WELL AS IN THE COMMERCIAL PACE PROGRAM. NOW WE IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HEARD ABOUT THIS AUDIT REQUIREMENT HAVE NARROWED THIS AUDIT REQUIREMENT PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY- THE CURRENT VERSION THE BILL CLARIFIES- THAT. THE WHO CAN PERFORM THE AUDIT IS GOING TO BE VERY EXPANDED AND WE SCALE DOWN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT. WE'VE NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE ENERGY AUDIT BY REALLY ONLY REQUIRING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PARTICULAR HOME IMPROVEMENTS BEING MADE- TO BE ASSESSED FOR SUITABILITY. AND WE ALLOWED A WAIVER OF THE AUDIT FOR EMERGENCY HOME IMPROVEMENTS THIS IS REALLY A SUITABILITY TESTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. UNDER THE CURRENT TEXT OF SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX CONSERVATIVELY- WE EXPECT THAT THERE OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY HOME ENERGY AUDITORS AND STATE. AND AT THE COST OF ENTRY FOR NEW AUDITORS WOULD BE VERY LOW. NOW YOU MAY HEAR FROM OPPONENTS OF THE L. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD FROM OPPONENTS OF THE BILL. THAT HOME ENERGY AUDITS CAN COST UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OR MORE. AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE OF A TYPICAL INTERVIEW WHAT IT WOULD BE A HARD A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS. BUT AS BEFORE SEVENTY SIX IS A REQUIREMENT. BECAUSE IT'S JUST BEEN NARROWED THE SUITABILITY REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED HOME IMPROVEMENTS. WILL BRING THAT DOWN WE'RE HOPING SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY DOLLARS OR HUNDRED DOLLARS. SOMETHING THAT BY THE WAY CAN BE ROLLED INTO THE PACE FINANCING IF THE PROJECT IS ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO BE USED IN A PACE. FINANCING STRUCTURE. THE SECOND IMPORTANT REFORM THE SB FOUR SEVENTY SIX MAKES IS HALTING PAYMENTS TO PACE CONTRACTOR. UNTIL A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR HAS OBTAINED COPIES OF PERMITS OR FINAL INSPECTIONS. TO VERIFY THAT ALL WORK HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY PERFORMED. RESIDENTIAL PACES MANY OF YOU KNOW HAS A HISTORY OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS REGARDING UNFINISHED. OR AN ACCEPTABLE WORK AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT CONTRACTORS HAVE CHARGE FOR BUT NEVER INSTALLED. WELL THE GOALS OF PACE ARE ONES THAT ARE LAUDABLE AND IMPORTANT ONES THAT I SHARE. AFTER ALL WE DO WANT OUR HOMES GETTING TO- ENERGY EFFICIENCY IT'S IMPORTANT WAY TO TRY TO MEET OUR- AMBITIOUS ENERGY ZERO EMISSIONS ENERGY MANDATES IN THE STATE. THIS PROGRAM HAS UNFORTUNATELY BEEN MARRED WITH CONSUMER FRAUD AND ABUSE. THE PACE PROGRAM IS FAILING AND EVIDENCE ABOUNDS. THE ONLY THREE STATES AT THIS POINT STILL USE PACE CALIFORNIA MISSOURI AND FLORIDA. IN CALIFORNIA L. A. COUNTY HAS ALREADY ENDED ITS PACE PROGRAM AFTER DETERMINING THAT THE PROGRAM LACKED ADEQUATE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THE WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS IS ENDING ITS PACE PROGRAM. AND JUST THIS MONTH AND THE FBI MOVE TO HAVE REP REVOKE RENOVATE AMERICA'S PACE ADMINISTRATOR LICENSE. AFTER HOMEOWNERS IN SAN. DIEGO COUNTY WERE REPEATEDLY DEFRAUDED. IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THE SAID QUO IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AND EXPOSES CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS TO TOO MUCH RISK. NOW SOMEONE SAID THAT THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY END THE PACE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. I ARGUE THAT IT DOES THE OPPOSITE THIS GIVES A LIFELINE THROUGH MEANINGFUL REFORMS. TO THIS PROGRAM THAT RIGHT NOW IS FAILING THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE TO ASK SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS FUTURE IN THE STATE. GIVEN ITS DIRECTION. NOW AGAIN I APOLOGIZE I REALLY WANTED TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS AYE I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS. BUT I DON'T WANT THIS BILL TO BE A SOMETHING THAT GETS PASSED WITHOUT MEANINGFUL CHANGES THAT WILL ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE LEVELS OF FRAUD THAT WERE SAYING. AND THEN ULTIMATELY HAVE THE INDUSTRY POINTED THIS BILL IN TWO YEARS OR FOUR YEARS. AS A REASON WHY WE DON'T NEED FOR THE REGULATION I DON'T THINK THIS BILL WITHOUT THE AUDIT GOES FAR ENOUGH- AND SO THAT IS WHY I RELUCTANTLY AM. ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN THE SITUATION. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL- STACEY TAUGHT FROM UC IRVINE CONSUMER LAW CLINIC. AND JENNIFER SPERLING FROM THE BETSY TECH LEGAL SERVICES. OPERATOR OPERATOR LOOKING FOR MISS TUCKER A MIST BERMAN PLACE. THANK YOU BOTH FIND GIRLFRIEND. HELLO THANK YOU MY NAME IS JENNIFER BURLINGAME A LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY WITH ATHLETIC IN LOS ANGELES I REPRESENT LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS AND SENIORS AND I'M PROUD TO BE STANDING WITH SENATOR MAN AND DEPARTING AT THREE FOUR SEVEN SIX TODAY. YOU FINANCING TARGET LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS WITH LOANS THEY CAN'T AFFORD WHICH BECOME SUPER PRIORITY TAX LIENS THAT PUT THEIR HOMES AT RISK. NOTING AGAINST ENERGY ON IT BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE AN UP FRONT COST TO THE CONSUMER FUNDAMENTALLY MISSES THE TRUTH OF WHAT A HARMFUL COST TO A CONSUMER REALLY IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE PAGE PROGRAM. THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IS THE COST A CLIENT WAS CHARGED. FOR SEVENTEEN WINDOWS. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IS THE PRICE OF TWO DOLLARS. FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER THREE HIGH EFFICIENCY TOILET IT LUDICROUS TO THINK THAT AT THESE PRICES PAGE FINANCE IT WILL CREATE A COST SAVINGS TO THE CONSUMER BY THE WAY NONE OF THESE PRODUCTS WERE EVER INSTALLED BUT THE CLIENT IS PAYING ANYWAY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY YEAR FOR TWENTY YEARS FOR LITERALLY NOTHING. A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAH I DON'T THE COST ONE POINT OF PAYING FOR SOMETHING CALLED HIGH PERFORMANCE ROOFING I'M NOT TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT HOME PAYMENT LINING THE POCKETS THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE NIGHT PRESENTED TO KICK BACK TO THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY SPONSORING THE PROGRAM. THESE ARE NOT EXCEPTIONAL CASE THAT ENDED COMMITTEE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE PAST FEW YEARS L. A. COUNTY LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE SEEN OVER FIVE HUNDRED VICTIMS OVERWHELMING OUR INTAKE LINE FOR SHOCKING STORIES THAT SIMPLY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAPPEN IF PEACE WERE REGULATED WITH THE SCRUTINY. OTHER PROPERTY SECURED LOAN PRODUCTS WE HAVE HEARD HEARTBREAKING STORIES FROM ALL. CORNERS OF THE STATE. RANDY FUNDAMENTALLY NOW SIR UP PURPOSES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH AT THE FOUR SEVENTY SIX. TO DO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL ABOUT IT LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS DON'T NEED ACCESS TO TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH. OF COOL COAT PAINT. THEY DON'T NEED TO BE SET UP FOR FAILURE WITH A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES NOTE STATE GUARD THAT THE COSTLY IMPROVEMENTS THEY ARE UNDERTAKING WILL BE ENERGY EFFICIENT. COST EFFECTIVE OR INSTALLED PROPERLY WHAT THEY NEEDED PROTECTION FROM PREDATORY PAYDAY LOAN IF YOU ARE GENUINELY WORRIED ABOUT COST TO LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. YOU WILL NOT LET THE PAID PROGRAM CONTINUE ANOTHER MINUTE WITHOUT AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS TO KEEP COSTS IN CHECK TO KEEP THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS HONEST AND TO MAKE SURE THE WORK IS ACTUALLY GETTING DONE. PLEASE VOTE YES ON. SB FOUR SEVEN SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER MISTYPED CONSUMER LAW CLINIC YEAH THANK YOU. HI. WELL YES THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU AND TO SENATOR MAN FOR HIS EFFORTS ON THIS BILL I'M HERE ON BEHALF AT UC IRVINE CONSUMER LAW CLINIC CLIENT WHEN OUR CLINIC STARTED I CONDUCTED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. A LOT OF GAP THE ISSUE THAT REPEATEDLY CAME UP WITH HOMEOWNERS VICTIMIZED BY PACE. SINCE THEN OUR CLINIC HAS BEEN OVERWHELMED AFTER THE FIRST YEAR WE SHUT DOWN OUR INTAKE WHICH REMAINS. CHINESE COMPLEX FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION. SB FOUR SEVEN SIX CAN PREVENT THAT BY ENSURING HOMEOWNERS HAVE CRUCIAL INFORMATION TO A BATH AND EFFECTIVE ENERGY EFFICIENT IMPROVEMENTS. AS OUR CLIENTS ARE ALL LOW TO MODERATE INCOME WE WANT TO ENSURE A FAIR AND EQUAL ACCESS TO CREDIT AND FIRMLY BELIEVE A SMALL UP FRONT INVESTMENT AND AN ENERGY AUDIT WILL PAY DIVIDENDS. AND ENERGY AUDIT WHICH IS ALREADY REQUIRED BY MANY OTHER GREEN FINANCING PRODUCT OFFERED BY FANNIE MAE FHA FREDDIE MAC AND EVEN COMMERCIAL PACE. THE OPPOSITION HAD WRONGFULLY ASSUMED HOMEOWNERS WILL BE OVER BURDENED BUT THE BILL DOES NOT INDICATE WELL THERE THE COST IT COULD BE COVERED BY THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR OR WITH PUBLIC FUNDING AS SACRAMENTO DOES FOR THE COMMERCIAL PACE PROGRAM. ALSO OF IMPORTANCE IS THE REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE WORK IS COMPLETE AND CONNECT AT OUR CLINIC IS CURRENTLY HANDLING THREE PAID CASES IN WHICH THE SOLAR PANELS WERE NOT CONNECTED BEFORE THE MONEY WAS RELEASED. NOW YEARS LATER TWO OF THE THREE HOMEOWNER STILL DO NOT HAVE OPERATIONAL SOLAR PANELS. A SIMPLE UP FRONT INVESTMENT IN AN ENERGY AUDIT WOULD HAVE ALSO ST SEVENTY FOUR YEAR OLD ALMOST FOSTER FROM ENTERING INTO AN AFFECT MY CONTRACT. TOTALING OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS OF WHICH ALMOST NINETY TWO THOUSAND MORE THAN HALF ITS INTERESTS AND FEES. MYTHBUSTERS NOW IMMINENT RISK OF FORECLOSURE THE PAGE PROGRAM COULD ABSORB THE COST OF AN ENERGY AUDIT TO PREVENT FAMILIES WHO LIKE MISBAH TURF FROM LOSING THEIR FAMILY'S GENERATIONAL HOMES. THE REST OF THE NATION IS NOW LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA TO REFORM THIS PROGRAM AND TO REMAIN THE LEADER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GREEN ENERGY FINANCING. IF THIS BILL DOES NOT PASS THE PAGE WILL CONTINUE TO HARM HOUSEHOLDS AND UNDERMINE THE NATION'S TRUST AND FUTURE GREEN. ENERGY EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL LET'S GO TO THE WITH. IN OFFICE. WE HAVE TO- MISS CRISTINA SOTO. AND AMOS CLAUDIA MARTINEZ. BOTH LANES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTINE AND I'M A RETIRED PROPERTY OWNER IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA WHO DOES SUPPORT CASE TODAY I URGE YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB FOUR SEVEN SIX UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE AUDIT MANDATE. WHEN MY FAMILY WAS LOOKING TO MAKE UPGRADES TO OUR HOME WE EXPLORED A NUMBER OF OPTIONS TO ADD VALUE TO YOUR HOME AND TO DEAL WITH THE SUMMER HEAT AFTER GOING THROUGH THE LIST OF OPTIONS WE FELT THAT WHITE GREEN AND PAYS FOR THE BEST CHOICE FOR US FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO INSTALL LARGE PATIO SHADE STRUCTURE THAT COLDER HOME. LOWERING OUR ENERGY BILL WE ALSO INSTALLED NEW HIGH HIGH EFFICIENCY JERK AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM IN OUR YARDS SAVING PRECIOUS WATER AND LOWERING OUR WATER BILL AS WELL SH IF I HAD THE PAPER AND ITS ENERGY AUDIT UP FRONT THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADDED COST AND WOULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSING TO DETERMINE WHAT I NEEDED TO COMPLETE COMPARED TO THE LIST OF THINGS HE OUGHT IT WOULD SUGGEST. THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED MYMIND AND MADE PAYS LESS APPEALING FOR MY FAMILY IN FACT AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETIRE WITHOUT USING PACE AND WOULD HAVE HAD TO WORK LONGER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN ORDER. TO MAKE THESE PROPERTY UPGRADES. WHY EXPLAINED THE TEAM WOULD WORK. AND HOW I CAN MAKE UPGRADE WITH NO MIND MONEY DOWN. I WAS SO EXCITED AND HAPPY WITH WHY GRANT PASTE BECAUSE IT MADE OUR PROJECT AFFORDABLE. THE BEST PART WAS I DID NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY MONEY OUT OF POCKET. WHICH ALLOWED ME TO AVOID TAPPING INTO MY PRECIOUS RETIREMENT SAVINGS. ROGIC WENT PRECISELY AS DESCRIBED WHICH ALSO HELP PRESERVE OUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS. I OPPOSE SB FOUR SEVEN SIX AS DRAFTED BECAUSE LIKE ME. THERE ARE OTHER FAMILY OWNERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE UPGRADES TO THEIR HOME. AND PASTE COULD BE THEIR MOST COST EFFECTIVE OPTION. FORCING HOMEOWNERS TO PAY FOR AN ENERGY AUDIT OUT OF POCKET IS NOTHING MORE THAN ATTACK. THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HELP PROPERTY OWNERS LIKE MYSELF. MAKE THEIR HOME SAFER AND MORE EFFICIENT. PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB FOUR SEVEN SIX UNLESS THE AUDIT MANDATE IS REMOVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS CONNIE MARTINEZ MY REPRESENTS THE L. A. METRO HISPANIC CHAMBER.

OTHER CHAMBER SUPPORTS PAY FINANCING BECAUSE IT EXPANDS EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY AND RESILIENCE UPGRADES FOR WORKING FAMILIES THAT WISH TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND SECURITY OF THEIR HOME. WE BELIEVE THAT AMENDING AT THREE FOUR SEVEN SIX. WHAT CHANGES WILL PRESERVE THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS WITHOUT ELIMINATING PACE AS A FINANCING OPTION FOR CALIFORNIA BACKGROUND. I WANTED TO WORK WITH THAT THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON A FEW OF THE ITEMS. THERE ARE VERY FEW PIECE.

OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS ENERGY AUDIT REQUIREMENTS IN THE APARTMENT EVEN THOUGH SOME AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO REDUCE THE SCALE OF THE MANDATORY AUDIT PERFORMED. AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CERTIFIED AUDITOR THANK YOU PERFORM THE AUDIT WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE A LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CERTIFIED ENERGY AUDITOR. AND THEIR AUDITS ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY THE ENERGY AUDIT MANDATE WILL CAUSE. PROJECT DELAYS WHICH WILL INCREASE THE COST TO THE CONSUMER FAMILIES WE HAVE TO WAIT WEEKS OR LONGER TO SCHEDULE AN ENERGY AND ENERGY AUDIT. PERFORMED THE AUDIT CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN THE PROJECT. MANDATORY ENERGY AUDITS ARE JUST SIMPLY BAD PUBLIC POLICY- FURNITURE INDUSTRY GATHERS THE PERSON OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOME IMPROVEMENTS ELEVEN FINANCED FIVE BILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN BENEFICIAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR COMMUNITIES. I REDUCE FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. OVER TEN BILLION GALLONS OF WATER HAVE BEEN SAVED.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHETHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU CENTER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AND HELPING ME UNDERSTAND A NEW ASPECT THE PLACE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT BEFOREHAND- I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION OF TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT- THE PIECE AUDIT IS NOT NOT CANNOT BE BUNDLED AND- THEM SORRY THE EFFICIENCY AUDIT CANNOT BE BUNDLED INTO THE PACE FINANCING YOU SAY IT IS COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS AROUND THE EQUITY ISSUE IN THE HOW WILL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE ON IT I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE YET BUT IF IT CAN'T BE BUNDLED IN. TO ANY SORT OF FINANCING HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS CAN ACCESS THE FUNDING I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- MY STRONG UNDERSTANDING I'M HAPPIER FOR THIS TO MY WITNESSES HERE IS THAT THE- AUDIT OR THIS IS SUITABILITY AUDIT CAN BE ROLLED INTO THE FINANCING SO THE MAIN QUESTION IS WHAT YOU DO IF THE CONSUMER THE HOUSEHOLD DECIDES NOT TO PROCEED WITH PACE FINANCING- AND OF COURSE THAT DOES PRESENT OBSTACLE NOW WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR WE HAVE NOT SAID THE CONSUMER HAS TO PAY FOR THIS. WE BELIEVE THAT- IT COULD BE THE PUBLIC FINANCING AND MANY CITIES HAVE ADOPTED PROGRAMS LIKE THIS AS WAS MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE WITNESSES TESTIMONIES I COULD BE THE CONTRACTOR THEMSELVES IT COULD BE THE PACE PROGRAM OKAY MISTER- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I ONLY CLEAR WHAT WE ENVISION HERE IS A STRIPPED DOWN SUITABILITY STANDARD AND WE HAVE MADE NUMEROUS AMENDMENTS I'M WE DONE THAT WITHOUT ANY FEEDBACK FROM- INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE REFUSED TO WORK WITH US ON THIS AT ALL AND SO- WE HAVE MADE ALL THESE AMENDMENTS ON OUR OWN TRYING TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL- WE ACTUALLY OFFERED AT ONE POINT WE WERE STILL WILLING TO CONSIDER THIS. ESSENTIALLY A PRO FORMA SOLAR CHECK SO THAT IT WOULD JUST BE SOMETHING WITH WE KNOW THE NUMBER OF SOLAR PANELS WE KNOW HOW MUCH EFFICIENCY WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE ELECTRIC BILL AND SEE IF IT'S SUITABLE FOR THEM WITHOUT EVEN HAVING SOMEONE COME TO YOUR HOME BUT AGAIN WE HAD NO RESPONSE TO THESE- REPEATED- ENTREATIES TO THE OTHER SIDE. BUT OUR GOAL HERE IS TO MAKE THIS LIKE A FIFTY DOLLAR OUR- ENERGY. FOR MOST TYPE OF PROJECTS OR LESS- WE ENVISION A WIDE POOL OF AUDITORS- AND OF COURSE I AGAIN I'M I'M- FAIRLY CLEAR THIS IS SOMETHING WE- ASK FOR THE VERY OUTSET. I ASKED PERSONALLY ABOUT. CAN THIS BE ROLLED UP IN THE FINANCING I WAS TOLD ABSOLUTELY YES BY LET'S COUNCIL. I WAS TOLD YES BY OUR SPONSORS BUT I'D LIKE TO REFER THIS QUESTION- TO MY WITNESSES- SO JENNIFER OR STACY IF EITHER OF YOU COULD TAKE THAT ON I'D APPRECIATE IT. YES AND THIS IS STACEY TACTIC IN AND TO TAKE THAT ISSUE ON- I WOULD STATE THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT FINANCING COULD BE SET UP IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE COST FOR THE ENERGY AUDIT COULD BE ROLLED INTO THE FINANCING. AT ORIGINATION IN FACT THE PLANS THAT DO REQUIRE ENERGY AUDITS FOR RESIDENTIAL PAY FINANCING ALREADY HAVE THIS FEATURE THAT INCLUDES WITH FANNIE MAE FREDDIE MAC FHA. IN COMMERCIAL PACE AND SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED WITHIN THOSE AREAS PROGRAM WE THINK THAT THAT CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED HERE WITHIN THAT TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COST BEING AVOIDED BY THE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE UP SOLD INSTEAD MORE EXPENSE. IMPROVEMENT THAN WHAT THE ENERGY AUDIT REVEALED THOSE IMPROVEMENTS WOULD ACTUALLY GAIN FOR THEM THAT'S THE VALUE OF THE AUDIT IS TO ENSURE THAT IF A LOW INCOME HOMEOWNER IS TAKING ON DEBT. IN ORDER TO FINANCE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS THAT IN THE END OF THOSE PRODUCTS ARE GOING TO PAY FROM THEMSELVES AND THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THAT SAVINGS IN THEIR UTILITY BILLS. ENSURING THAT THE FINANCING IS ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE FOR THEM AND. WILL NOT RESULT IN THE LOSS IS THAT. DURABLE. BUT IT IS A CRISIS- SORRY JUST SAY FINE FINE- SO WHAT THAT THAT DOES A LEVY EIGHT SOME OF MY CONCERNS I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE EXPLICIT IT'S NOT VERY COMFORTING TO BE HERE AND THE OTHER HOUSING HERE WE BELIEVE IT WILL LEAD WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HEAR IS IT WILL BE RIGHT NOT WE BELIEVE THAT ARE YOU KNOW. WELL TO FAR FOR THAT I KNOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO GO AND- I HAVE TO BE HONEST I WAS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL YESTERDAY AND THEN I GOT A TEXT FROM MY SISTER THAT EXACTLY THE FRAUD YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT THIS BILL. WAS HAPPENING TO MY MOTHER WELL SO- I THINK IT IS MORE PREVALENT THAN WE THINK AND I THINK WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OF SELLING TO A SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO IS FIT BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW AS- YOU KNOW MAKING DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS IS. AS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF FOR THE PURPOSE OF I THINK WHAT WE WANT WITH THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY- THAT PAYS PROVIDE SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE THE BILL SO IT CAN BE CONSIDERED FURTHER COMMITTEE BUT I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THE FLOOR IF WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THESE ISSUES AND HOW SOME CERTAINTY THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY. MAKING IT UNAFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE. I APPRECIATE THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I. IF THIS BILL DOESN'T VATICAN ME YOU HAVE MY WORD THAT WE WILL MAKE THAT EXPLICIT MY WAS TOLD. MILEAGE COUNCIL THAT IT ALREADY IS ROLLED UP AND I THINK. THAT THE WITNESS TUTS TESTIMONY WAS THAT IN OTHER ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAMS- IT ALREADY IS ROLLED UP AND SO- I BELIEVE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IT. IT WILL BE THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND IF IT'S NOT CLEAR RIGHT NOW I AM HAPPY TO MAKE THAT CHANGE. HI MISS RIVAS. SUMMARY THIS. THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS SPELL- HE WAS. AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT. LAST YEAR L. A. COUNTY ENDED ITS PACE PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THE FRAUD I HAVE MANY CONSTITUENTS. THAT HAVE. GONE THROUGH THAT. AS A RESULT OF. OF AND TRAIN A PACE. AGREEMENT WITH AN ADMINISTRATOR- AND BUT- I'M NOT SURE. IF REQUIRED AN AUDIT. WELL OF WELL WE'LL CHANGE THAT I GUESS AND YOU KNOW WILL THAT IS THAT THE RIGHT SOLUTION RIGHT AND AN AUDIT THAT IN MY FOR MY CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE- MAJORITY LOW INCOME THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR SO IT'S AN ADDITIONAL COST TO THE HOMEOWNER- AND WHAT IS THIS AUDIT IS THIS. IS THE HOMEOWNER NOW GOING TO NOW SAY NO TO THE CONTRACTOR BECAUSE OF THIS AUDIT HOWEVER WE ASSURING THAT. THIS IS GOING TO WIN FOR BETTER INFORM THE HOMEOWNER I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- AND JUST AGAIN AS FAR AS HOW WE ENVISION YOU GOT IT IT'S REALLY KIND OF A SUITABILITY STANDARD RIGHT WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY THAT THIS IS NOT MEANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF I THINK ONE OF THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES WHO KNEW THAT SHE WANTED PAY SHE DONE HER OWN RESEARCH THIS IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THE COLD CALL TO THE GRANDMOTHER THAT CONTRACTORS WALKING DOOR TO DOOR. AND HITTING PEOPLE UP AND MISLEADING THEM AS TO WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS THAT PACE IS NOT A NORMAL FINANCING PROGRAM IT CREATES A SUPER SENIOR LEAN BACON CALLS FORECLOSURE OR OTHER PROBLEMS RIGHT IF YOU DON'T PAY IT CREATES ALL SORTS ATTENTION AND BECAUSE IT HAS THE GOVERNMENT'S IMPRIMATUR BEHIND IT IT IS MARKETED AS A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM I AND IT'S BEEN RIFE WITH ABUSE I GUESS THE CASE I'D MAKE IS THAT ONE I'D BE HAPPY TO EXPLORE PUBLIC- FUNDING FOR THIS I THINK THERE ARE ALREADY. PROGRAMS THAT DO THIS UTILITIES DO THIS CITIES DO THIS I I'M TOLD THAT PC MAY HAVE FUNDS THAT WE CAN ALLOCATE TOWARDS THIS PURPOSE BUT ALSO I GUESS IF WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS WAY WHAT IS FIFTY DOLLARS OR SO IN THE CONTEXT OF A SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT WHEN IT'S ROLLED UP ALL TOGETHER WHEN YOU AMORTIZE THAT OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE CASE ALONE I THINK THAT GIVEN THE SCALE OF FRAUD WERE SAYING YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT PENNIES PER MONTH RIGHT. BUT TO GIVE US COMFORT THAT THIS IS PREVENTING THE TYPES OF FRAUD THAT WE'RE SEEING I WOULDN'T PROPOSED THIS IF THIS PROGRAM WAS PRISTINE. AND WE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WITH HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ONE OPPOSITION WHEN. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE SO TO PEOPLE GET THE FRIED AND YOU HEARD- ONE OF MY WITNESSES SAY. THAT THIS IS THE MOST COMMON THING THEY'RE SAYING THAT THEIR BACKLOG WITH COMPLAINTS THIS IS A REAL ISSUE WE DON'T HAVE HARD NUMBERS ON HOW MANY. WE JUST KNOW THAT IT'S OVERWHELMING CONSUMER ADVOCATES. AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I DECIDED TO TAKE THIS ON AS A FRESHMAN. NOT NECESSARILY REALIZING HOW INTENSE THE POLITICS AROUND THIS WOULD BE- BUT BUT I THINK THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL I THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL CHECK. UP FRONT. THAT SAYS OKAY IS THIS AN APPROPRIATE PROJECT FOR YOU. FOR YOUR LEVEL FINANCES- FORGET WHAT YOUR ELECTRIC BILL IS WILL IT PROVIDE ENERGY AND TREATMENTS WILL SAVE YOU MONEY AT THE END OF THE DAY. AND THESE ARE ALL WORTHWHILE GOALS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TYPES OF FRAUD WERE SAYING. AND ALTERNATELY I BELIEVE THIS WILL SAVE ON AVERAGE THE AVERAGE CONSUMER MONEY IT MAY COST. THE OPPOSITION WITNESS A FEW PENNIES A MONTH IF YOU WILL SET UP IN THE PACE. BUT IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THE HEARTACHE OF HAVING THE STRESS THE TENSION OF THE BEING DEFRAUDED. BY THE MANY SCAMSTERS THAT ARE OUT THERE UNFORTUNATELY. I'M SO AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO WORK PERFECT AS I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN KIND OF WORKING THROUGH THIS ON OUR OWN BECAUSE- INDUSTRY HAS NOT WORKED WITH US ON THIS AUDIT THEY'VE TAKEN A HARD POSITION FROM THERE TO VERY BEGINNING. THAT THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY OUT OF ANY KIND NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE TRY TO TAILOR THIS TO JUST BE AS MINIMAL A BURDEN AS POSSIBLE. BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM IN THIS INDUSTRY- AND THAT AN AUDIT ALONG WITH THE BACK AND HOME INSPECTION PRONG THAT WE'RE REQUIRING THIS BILL AS WELL. WILL HELP MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS. TO CRACKING DOWN ON THE FRONT OR SING. I AGREE WITH YOU. IF YOU KNOW THE AUDIT IF YOU HAVE MORE DETAILS ON HOW THE AUDIT THE- COST. ME KEEP SAYING FIFTY DOLLARS BUT- I'M NOT. SURE WHERE THAT NUMBER IS COMING FROM. IT'S MIKE MY HEAD INFO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WIN YEAH YOU ENVISION THAT I THINK OUT FIFTY DOLLARS. SEEMS VERY REASONABLE. BUT I'M NOT SURE. WELL I DON'T HAVE ANY DATA THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH. WHAT IS THE TRUE COST OF THESE AUDIBLES. I LIVE IN A RURAL COUNTY YEAH- AND SOMEONE HAS TO COME FROM. TWO HOURS AWAY. UP TO PERFORM AN AUDIT YEAH. HOW MUCH IS THAT GOING TO BE IS IT REALLY ONLY GOING TO BE FIFTY DOLLARS. YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF THERE WERE STATE PROGRAM. YEAH THAT. YOU KNOW THE COPAY FOR THE HOMEOWNER WAS ONLY FIFTY DOLLARS. AND SO. THAT TO ME ISN'T CLEAR UP THIS BILL IF IT WORK. I WOULD BE WILLING TO SUPPORT IT- BECAUSE THAT'S- YOUR WHOLE. THE SOLUTION RIGHT. TO PREVENT TEEN IT'S HAPPENED MORE FRAUD YEAH. AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT UTILITIES AND OTHERS MAYBE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THESE. AUDIT PROGRAMS. I KNOW THERE ARE THEIR COMMONALITY COUNTY. AND SOME OF THE UTILITIES THAT GO OUT TO YOUR HOME. USUALLY IT'S FREE. TO ALL ESPECIALLY TO A LOW INCOME. CONSUMER I KNOW MY MOM WHEN SHE- HAD HER OWN HOME. THERE WAS AN AUDITOR THAT CAME OUT AND MADE SUGGESTIONS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT HER HOME. IT WAS COMPLETELY FREE TO HER. YEAH AND- BUT IN THIS CASE WE DON'T KNOW THE COST TO THE- HOMEOWNER I THINK THAT. IT COULD BE CREATING MAY BE MORE FRONT END UP. IN THAT INDUSTRY AND I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT. AND SINCE. THE DETAILS OF. THAT PART OF YOUR BILL. ARE CLEARER. AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A VISION. WELL BUT ARE YOU WILLING TO WORK MAKE THIS INTO YOUR BILL TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT VISION AND- MAKING IT MORE OF A REALITY. IN THE BILL WITH WEEKS OF. SORRY YEAH. TO INTERRUPT. THE FIRST RESPOND ON I GUESS I'D SAY IT FOR- WE HAVE DATA POINTS AS THE FIFTY INCOME OUT OF NOWHERE OUT WHICH IS IT A HOME RIGHT NOW COSTS IN MOST REGIONS BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED THAT'S EVEN TRUE HIGH COST AREAS LIKE MIKE ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO- THE OPPOSITION STATED FIGURE SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS SOMETHING THAT I SEEM TO COME I KIND OF COME OUT OF THE GOLD STANDARD OF A VERY RARE TYPES OF ENERGY AUDITS. ACCORDING TO VARIETY OF CONSUMER WEBSITES HOME ENERGY AUDITS TYPICALLY COST BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS ON AVERAGE THAT'S THE SOUP TO NUTS BUT AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE ARTICULATED OUR BILL IS THAT THIS IS PROJECT SPECIFICS ARE NOT LOOKING AT EVERY WINDOW EVERY YOU KNOW AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE CONTRACTORS PROPOSING WAYS TO BE A SUBCONTRACTOR COMES YOUR HOUSE AND SAYS WE WANT TO DO- SOLAR PANELS WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF HOME IMPROVEMENT. WE WOULD ONLY LOOK AT THAT- AND I DO BELIEVE AND WE ALSO LOWERED THE STANDARDS FOR WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS FOR A ENTERED ENERGY AUDITOR OF THIS TYPE NEEDS NEEDS TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS SO ACCORDING AND I'M HAPPY TO REFER THIS MIGHT MIGHT WITNESSES BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE DETAILS BUT- WE ESTIMATE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO DO THESE ARTISTS YOU WON'T HAVE PEOPLE DRIVING FROM TWO HOURS AWAY EVEN IN THE RURAL COUNTIES- IN THE INLAND COUNTIES. THAT WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE ELIGIBLE PEOPLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF SCALE DOWN ENERGY AUDIT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED I AM HAPPY TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO DO A PRO FORMA SOLAR ASSESSMENT SO THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW NOT EVEN REQUIRING IT NECESSARILY IN IN PERSON INSPECTION WE HAVE AN OPEN TO THESE TYPES OF CHANGES- WE DO BELIEVE THAT'LL DRIVE THE COST DOWN FROM THAT TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR LEVEL TO SOMETHING BELOW THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU WITH ANY CERTAINTY WHAT THAT'LL BE. BECAUSE THIS IS MARKET FORCES AT PLAY RIGHT SUPPLYING DEMAND PRETTY SIMPLE CONCEPT SO THAT I WOULD LOVE TO TURN IT OVER TO- ONE OF MY WITNESSES TO HELP ARTICULATE- A BETTER ANSWER FOR THIS- JENNIFER. OR STATION IF YOU HAVE A RESPONSE. I'M YES THIS IS STACEY TODD- AGAIN SPEAKING ADDS TO AND KIND OF THE AVAILABILITY AND- HOME ENERGY RATERS AND SO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE A AT HERS RATERS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY AND HAD THEIR PROVIDERS TO ASK FOR THAT TRAINING AND AUTHORIZATION OF THAT IS ACTUALLY ALREADY OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- THERE'S A HANDBOOK INTO A MANUAL THAT SPECIFICALLY OUTLINE EXACTLY WHAT THE AUDITED TO CHEAT. ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS WHAT THE AUDIT IS TRYING TO DO HERE FOR OUR HOMEOWNERS IS THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SHOW THAT THE ENERGY AUDIT ESTABLISHES THE STATE INTO INVESTMENT RATIO IS GREATER THAN ONE WHAT THAT MEANS IS IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY THAT FINANCED IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE TERM. MUST OUTWEIGH THE COST OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT ENSURED THAT THE HOMEOWNER DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THAT THE REDUCTION IN THEIR UTILITY COSTS AND ALSO IT ENSURES THAT THE MORTGAGE LENDERS DO NOT HAVE INCREASED RISK. DUE TO THAT HE SAID STUPOR PRIORITY LIEN STATUS IN ADDITION TO THAT AND LOOKING AT THE AVAILABILITY LET STATE AND THEN- OUT IN THAT SITUATION IN WHICH A HOMEOWNER MAY NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH- THE ACTUAL FINANCING IN INSTEAD OF OUT OF POCKET WERE THESE ENERGY AUDIT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ENERGY AUDIT THEY ATUALLY SHOWN TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AND YOU COULD SAVE UP THEY MAKING EVEN SMALL CHANGES AND SMALL AND EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS I WITHIN THE PROPERTY WHICH IS WHY AS SENATOR MEN MENTION. THERE ARE ALREADY A NUMBER OF FREE OR NO COST ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT WOULD BE THEN AVAILABLE TO LOW INCOME CONSUMERS AND THAT INCLUDES THOSE THROUGH UTILITY AS THEY OFFERED THAT FREE ENERGY AUDITS THERE'S OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DO THAT AS WELL. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE HAVE BEEN AND YOU GET THE POLITIES THAT IS SPECIFICALLY I HAVE REYES DOLLARS FOR ENERGY AUDIT BECAUSE THAT INCREASES OUR OVERALL GOALS AND ACHIEVING- EFFICIENCY I'M AND MOST TIMES THAT PUBLIC VETTING. THROUGH AS TEXT ME BLOCK GRANT AND OTHER WAY AND WE TO REDO THE COSTS. I TO THE HOME DOING I WOULD JUST. THIS IS ALREADY A REGULATED INDUSTRY THAT CAN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS WHETHER OR NOT THE HOMEOWNER GOES FORWARD WITH THE PEACE FINANCING AND IT REALLY SERVICES THAT CHECKED AGAINST THE PREDATORY PRACTICES THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE IS A SPOT ALL. HELP TO PERPETUATE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE DO BELIEVE AGAIN IT CAN BE LOW COST AND THAT IT IS- AN ESSENTIAL ASSESSMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THESE CAPE BATMAN. WORKABLE FOR THE LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS WHO MAY NEED TO UTILIZE THEM. IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE OTHER AND- JENNIFER BUT THEN FOR ABOUT ABOUT IT AND WELL I WAS LOOKING AT THE OTHER POINT THAT I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT THE AUDIT CAN BE A CHECK ON AND I WOULD LEADING TO THE TO MY COMMENT. IS A REALLY RAMPANT- YOU KNOW PRICE GOUGING THAT HAPPENS IN THIS PROGRAM AND SO IF YOU'RE YOU KNOW. IN TALKING ABOUT THAT RATIO OF THE COST TO THE SAVINGS. YOU KNOW A CONTRACTOR WHO CAN AT TELL YOU SOMETHING AT THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE PRICE THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THROUGH THE PAID PROGRAM. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ENERGY EFFICIENT FOR THE HOMEOWNER BUT THAT WOULDN'T CREEK INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG CONTRACTORS IN CURRENT ON ITS CONTRACTORS TO GET INTO THE PROGRAM. AND ACTUALLY GET HOMEOWNERS YOU KNOW ACCURATE HONEST PRICING FOR THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY SAVE THEM MONEY OVER THE LONG TERM. AFFORD FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE CLEARLY. YOU KNOW. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THAT BACK BUT AT THE SAME A DIFFERENT CONTRACTOR MIGHT. MAKE A DIFFERENCE- ESTIMATE FOR YOU FOR A LAUGH THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD GO FORWARD WITH AND YOU MIGHT USE CASE FINANCING UP TO OBTAIN THE PRODUCT THAT AND I HAD MORE EQUITABLE COST. IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE QUICK POINT ON TO THAT- WE AS I MENTIONED WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO LOWER THE THRESHOLD AND TO CLARIFY WHAT TYPE OF SCALE DOWN AUDIT WE'RE LOOKING FOR- A AND EVEN IF THERE WERE NO ADDITIONAL ALL. THE PEOPLE THAT. DID THAT AT A PLAN TO QUALIFY TO DO THESE OUT OF. THEY'RE CURRENTLY FIFTH HUNDRED FIFTY SAID INSPECTOR IN THIS. GIVEN THAT THE ARE JUST OVER TWELVE TO. PAGE PROJECTS COMPLETED IN TWENTY NINETEEN LAST PRE OPENED YEAR. THAT WE SAY THAT THERE'S ONE AUDITOR FOR EVERY NINE CASE PROJECTS OUT THERE AND THAT'S ASSUMING AGAIN. THAT NOBODY ELSE APPLIES TO DO THESE TYPES OF. STRIPPED DOWN PACE ARTISTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST. YOU OF MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK YOU CENTER FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE. I SAID ON THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND CHAIRED THE SAN MARINO TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY PACE PROGRAMS WAS A TOPIC WE'RE GOING THROUGH MORE ON THE LEAVES THAT THEY'RE PUTING ON THE HOMES WHEN THEY TRIED TO RESELL THOSE HOMES ARE SELDOM HOMES. SO WE ENDED UPBY CREATING A SUBORDINATE SUBORDINATION CLAUSE THAT WAS IN THERE THAT WAS ACCEPTED- WHEN THOSE LEADS ARE PUT ON THERE SO THAT THE HOMEOWNER COULD CHARGE WILL MOVE FORWARD AND THEN THE COST IT WAS OR WASN'T THE FIRST ITEM ON THE LEAD- AND NOW I'M LOOKING AT WHAT'S COMING FORWARD I DO HAVE SOME SOME CONCERNS. OVER THE COST OF THE AUDIT THAT WOULD COME INTO THE HOMEOWNER YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S- THE HIGH COST OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND A LOW COST OF TWO HUNDRED YES EVEN IF YOU TRY TO FIND AVERAGE COST AIR DOESN'T EQUATE TO THE FIFTY DOLLARS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT WHAT THAT YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT SCALING DOWN THE AUDIT TO CERTAIN AREAS. SO MY QUESTION IS WHEN YOU SCALE IT DOWN TO CERTAIN AREAS THE NUMBERS THAT YOU IDENTIFY WITH SIXTEEN HUNDRED BEING THE HIGH TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS BEING THE LOW IS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT SCALE DOWN ON IT BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE PRESENTING OF TO THIS COMMITTEE. SO JUST TO CLARIFY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WAS NOT MY FIGURE THAT CAME FROM INDUSTRY HI THERE THAT'S THAT'S THE NUMBER. YOU'RE FIGURE WAS FIFTY DOLLARS NO I ALSO I WENT RIGHT JUST TO CLARIFY AND CLEAR IF I GET RESPONSE- THE INDUSTRY HAS SAID THAT THESE ARE WHOLE HOME ENERGY AUDITS THE SOUP TO NUTS EXAMINING EVERYTHING YOUR HOME FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCIES ARE SIXTEEN HUNDRED I WOULD I WAS CLARIFYING WAS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT NUMBER IS GROSSLY INFLATED THAT ACCORDING TO CONSUMER WEBSITES. IT THESE AUDITS COST BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AGAIN THAT'S THE WHOLE HOME ENERGY AUDIT THE SOUP TO NUTS LOOKING EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOME WITH THE AVERAGE BEING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS MMM RIGHT NOW THAT'S AGAIN A WHOLE HOME ENERGY AUDIT LOOKING AT EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOME. WHAT WE ARE TALKING LIKE THERE'S. A PROJECT SPECIFIC ENERGY AUDITS- IF THE CONTRA COMES IN PROPOSES. YOU KNOW CHANGING WINDOWS TO ENTER EFFICIENT WINDOW. ADDING SHE YOUR PATH IS THE OPPOSITE WINS FIVE OKAY WHAT WHAT ARE THE INNER. PUT IN. ASSOCI WITH THOSE PROPOSED. IMPROVEMENTS RIGHT AND HOW DO THEY FIT IN WITH YOUR ENERGY USAGE WITH YOUR INCOME. AND ALL THAT PROVIDING YOU WITH A COSTS THAT YOU SEE THIS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE AUTO. IN OUR CASE WE DO SO IT'S NOT A WHOLE HOME ON IT. WILL BE NARROWLY TAILORED TO THE PERSON SPECIFIC PROJECT- pI PULL FIFTY THAT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE. A GUESSTIMATE MY ASPIRATIONAL GOAL THAT IS NOT A FIGURE THAT I HAVE ANY DATA FOR. BUT I THINK IF YOU DO THE MATH AND YOU SAY OKAY HOME HOME AUDIT COSTS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THAT'S SOMEONE COMING OUT SPENDING SEVERAL HOURS IN YOUR HOME LOOKING AT EVERYTHING OUT THERE. VERSUS SOMEONE JUST COMING TO LOOK AT A SPECIFIC PROJECT- I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE JUST GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS AND ALL THAT IT WOULD BE A LOT LESS. AND AGAIN I WANT TO JUST REPEAT THE POINT THAT. I HAVE OFFERED TO THE OTHER SIDE. HAVING SOLAR WHICH AGAIN IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST TYPES OF ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS ASSOCIATE WITH PACE. TO HAVE THAT BE A PRO FORMA CHECK A BOX BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE SOMEONE NECESSARILY COME OUT TO YOUR HOME YOU CAN KIND OF LOOK AT YOUR LACK OF BILL. YOU CAN LOOK AT- DTI ANOTHER. SIX AND JUST GAUGE LIKE WHAT THEY NEED AS FAR AS SOLAR AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT WITHOUT A ACTUAL INSPECTION SO. I'VE OFFERED THAT AS WELL AND WILLING TO STOKE ENTERTAIN THAT- BUT THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO MAKE THE AUDIT NARROWLY TAILORED AND IS CHEAPEST POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT. FIRST PEOPLE FROM USING THE PROGRAM. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT- PROVIDES FARMS CONSUMERS WITH NECESSARY INFORMATION PROVIDED A CHECK AGAINST THE TYPES OF FRAUD THAT ARE UNFORTUNATELY FAR TOO RAMPANT WITH THIS PROGRAM. NOT INTENTIONAL EFFORT I MEAN TO ME TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE HOME OWNER RIGHT NOW. JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE LEANS OVER PLAYING ON THEIR HOMES. HOWEVER DO YOU HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS. THAT HOMEOWNERS AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ASKING- THROUGH THESE PASTE GRAMS OR THE MINIMAL TO WHAT YOU SCALE DOWN TO A WINDOW OR TO THE WIDER SCALE. RIGHT OUT OF THE COST IT'S THEIR- IF YOUR GOAL IS A- TO FOR. DOLLAR THAT YOU. AGREED IT'S ONLY A MINIMAL COMPONENT THAT AVERAGE USERS ARE GETTING. YEAH WITHIN THIS PROJECT THAT WILL BRING UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS DO YOU KNOW. WHAT THAT. THAT AVERAGE- ASK IS. OF THE HOMEOWNER FROM THE PROVIDER- I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE DATA AND THAT IS NOT AGAIN AS I SAID. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA ON AROUND THE PACE PROGRAMS NOT BEAR. ONE OF THINGS WE'RE HOPING IS THAT THE FBI WILL COME UP WITH THAT DATA AND I THINK THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS. POST CODE OF DEVELOPING PLANS TO DO THAT- WE'VE HEARD INSTANCES WHERE HOMEOWNERS GET. AND IT'S PART OF THE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE THE CASE THE HOMEOWNER REQUESTING REPAIR. OTHER TIMES ITS CONTRACTORS. KIND OF DUPING HOMEOWNERS AND PROJECTS SO. WE'VE HEARD REPORTS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT. WE'VE HEARD REPORTS OF YOU KNOW LIKE. YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS A THOUSAND BUCKS RIGHT SO. OBVIOUSLY THE SCOPE OF. THE PARTICULARIZED AUDIT UNDER OUR BILL. WOULD DEPEND ON THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. BUT I GUESS I'D SAY YOU KNOW IF IT SAVES FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS RIGHT. WHICH IS THE AVERAGE COST OF A HOME ENERGY AUDIT. BUT IT'S FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD STILL ARGUE THAT THAT. IS AN APPROPRIATE UPFRONT INVESTMENT PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT WHEN YOU ADVERTISE THAT INTO THE PACE FINANCING STRUCTURE. IT'S GONNA BE A SMALL SMALL FRACTION OF THAT RIGHT. FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AS A MEANING FULL CHECK AGAINST FRAUD AND A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR HUNDRED THOUSAND OR WHATEVER. ALL HOME IMPROVEMENT. I THINK IS A WORTHWHILE INVESTMENT. GIVEN THE SCALE OF FRAUD WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. PROVIDE YOU HAVE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FARTHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AREAS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. DISADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE OF COLOR SO. IT DOESN'T AND OF MY QUESTION THANK YOU FOR A VERY SHORT I THINK IT'S A NOBLE. AREA BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS STILL AS FAR AS THAT AND HOW IT'S GONNA ACTUALLY BURDEN. ALONE ARE MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. FOR THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MISTER SAID I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY. I WAS MAYOR OF MY CITY. AND- ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO ACTUALLY MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE NAP. THE PACE PROGRAM MADE A PITCH TO THE CITY TO- DO PAYS. AND THEY MADE ALL SORTS OF PROMISES WHICH WERE NOT TRUE IT TO SHORTEN THIS IT BECAME THE WILD WEST SO LOOKING AT CURRENT LAW THAT HAS BEEN PASSED- IT'S CLEANED UP A LOT OF THE WILD WEST I BELIEVE YOUR BILL IS THE LAST PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. TO MAKE THIS EQUITABLE- WHAT I FIND CURIOUS AND ODD IT MAY BE A BILL FOR ANY OF US TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE. IS WHY DOES THE- ASSESSMENT THE AUDIT HAVE TO BE PAID CASH UP FRONT WHY NOT AMORTIZE IT WITH THE PACE PROGRAM FINANCING. THAT WILL BASICALLY TAKE MOST OF THIS ISSUE ALTHOUGH THE COURT- YEAH IT'S SO. THE OTHER THING. IS TO THIS DAY THROUGH MY NEIGHBORHOOD THE PACE PEOPLE STILL COME THROUGH DORMITORY FOR THREE WEEKS I DON'T KNOW IF I'M UNDER LIST OR WHAT BUT I DID MY OWN ASSESSMENT I MADE SEVENTY. SO MOST OF THE PACE PROGRAM FINANCING IS TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY YEARS MY LIFESPAN EXPECTANCY IN GOOD HEALTH IS TO AGE. EIGHTY SEVEN- I'M A LITTLE SHORT THERE. BUT THEY'RE STILL PETTINESS SO I BELIEVE THAT THIS ASSESSMENT THIS AUDIT WOULD BE GREAT ESPECIALLY FOR SENIOR CITIZENS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU SENATOR MAN- BEFORE I MOVE ON AND WANT TO KNOW IF ANY OF THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO REPLY TO. THAT I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE ON THERE BEFORE THE SAID TO STAY ON THE LINE. REGISTER OKAY- THIS IS THE OTHER QUESTIONS. SO I HAVE PO GOING I'M SORRY SOMEONE MORE THAT MAKE YOUR COMMENTS- IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE THEN. FOR ME I HAVE COMMENTS ONE ONE QUESTIONS- I THINK- THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SEVENTY FIRST- MAKES A GOOD POINT ABOUT- HOW THE- AUDIT WILL GET PAID I THINK THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS- THAT ISSUE IS NOT GOING TO BE RESOLVED. UNTIL AN AUDIT IS REQUIRED ONCE THE AUDIT IS REQUIRED THEN PEOPLE ARE GONNA START TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS- IS THIS MEANINGFUL ENOUGH IS THIS IMPORTANT ENOUGH. FOR US TO REQUIRE AN AUDIT AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO OPPOSITION ABOUT OTHER OPTIONS THAT- THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE- OTHER MAY IN FACT BE. SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS SEVERE THAN THE AUDIT THAT- IS ENVISIONED IT AT AT THIS POINT. I'M I THINK IT'S LOOKED VERY VERY LEGITIMATE TO- BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE COST OF THE AUDIT ON OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THE QUESTION FOR ME IS THAT OUTWEIGHED BY THE FRAUD THAT IS BEING VISITED UPON OUR LOW INCOME OR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THIS CALL CONSUMER FRAUD IS HAPPENING IT IS TYPICALLY GOING TO BE- VISITED UPON THOSE WHO ARE- UNAWARE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S BEING PATCHED- AND- YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S CLEAR OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND SO THE DECIDING FACTOR TO ME ON THIS- BILL WAS LISTENING TO THE ATTORNEYS FROM THAT STATIC. AND FROM IRVINE I FORGET THE NAME OF THE- OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE TESTIMONIALS THAT THEY PRESENT- WHICH ARE OUTRAGEOUS I MEAN TRULY OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLES OF CONSUMER FRAUD- SO I THINK THIS IS- A PROPOSAL IN THE IN THE BILL IS IMPORTANT AND. TO I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANYONE ELSE FOR QUESTIONS. SO I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. SO I WAS THINKING SENATOR SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE HOMEOWNER PAYS FOR THE AUDIT INTERVIEW AUDIT AND THEY DECIDE NOT TO PROCEED WITH THE PROJECT- IF THE HOME OUR WORK WILL HELP IF THE HOMEOWNER WOULD PAY FOR THE AUDIT. WHICH IS AN F. BECAUSE WE I WANT TO CLARIFY AGAIN WE LEAVE THIS OPEN AND WE BELIEVE IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM SAID THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WILL RISE BUT WE ALSO THINK IT WOULD MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE FOR CONTRACTORS TO BEAR THE UPFRONT COSTS AGAIN IF IT'S A LOW ENOUGH. THRESHOLD AND IT YOU KNOW THERE TO SAY IT'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OR THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND IMPROVEMENTS IF IT'S A WORTHWHILE PERCENT OF PROJECTS. I THINK AN HONEST CONTRACTOR TO I'LL PITCH YOU THE HUNDRED BUCKS OR WHATEVER IT IS FIFTY BUCKS WHATEVER THE COST IS UP FRONT KNOWING THAT IT CAN ROLL GET ROLLED UP AND I JUST WANNA CLARIFY I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY LET'S COUNCIL. THAT THIS THAT THE UP AUDIT CAN BE ROLLED IN THE PACE MANSINGH IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY DONE BECAUSE THERE IS THE BINARY DECISION YES NO IF THE HOMEOWNER ACTUALLY ONCE YOU SPACE. IF THE HOMEOWNER DECIDES NOT TO SPACE THEN THE COST OF THAT AUDIT WHOEVER BEARS IT IS EATEN BY THE WHOEVER PAID FOR WHETHER THAT'S A CONTRACTOR THE HOMEOWNER. OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T GET RULED IN THE CASE. OKAY SO I'M- SO THERE ANYTHING THE BILL WHICH FOR PRETTY. THE HOMEOWNER FOR- IN THE INSTANCE FOR AN ENERGY AUDIT POINTS OUT INEFFICIENCIES. IN THEIR HOMES HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REASON THEY'RE INVESTIGATING THE PROGRAM. I'M SORRY I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION FULLY IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL THE- WHICH WOULD PROTECT A HOMEOWNER IN THE INSTANCE WHERE AN ENERGY AUDIT POINTS OUT IN A FINISH INEFFICIENCIES IN THEIR HOME. HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REASON THEY'RE INVESTIGATING THE PROGRAM SO IF IT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IF AN ENERGY AUDITOR WOULD TO FRAUDULENTLY POINT OUT. THINGS THAT WERE. NOT THERE LIKELY THEY WERE TO SAY YOU HAVE LIKE A GAS LEAK OR IN ENERGY EFFICIENT WINDOWS- OFFERED TO MAYBE- STACY TALK HERE BUT I WAS IN THAT BE FRAUD- AND PROTECTED BY. EXISTING CONTRACTUAL CRIMINAL FRAUD LOSS BUT- MISS CUT FROM YOU SEE I CONSUMER LAW CLINIC MIGHT BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES AND YOU KNOW IT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SAME AS SENATOR MAN THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE IT IS THAT YOU KNOW IF THERE IS FRAUD THAT'S COMMITTED UNDER THE ENERGY AUDIT WORK FRAUDULENTLY RECOMMENDED AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE RECOURSE FOR THE HOMEOWNER IN THOSE. CIRCUMSTANCES THOUGH I HAVE TO BUT I CAN SOMEONE INTERPRET YOUR QUESTION A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WHICH IS S. B. AT ENERGY AUDIT- LOCATED AB OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE OR MORE COST EFFECTIVELY MADE- WHETHER OR NOT DEAD THAT THE HOMEOWNER WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE. OR MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CASE FINANCING AND M. AND IT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE WAY THAT THE BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. THE ENERGY AUDIT AND COVERS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE DONE AS LONG AS THEY ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS OF THE PEACE- PROGRAM AND THE APPROVED. ANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE ALLOWED WITHIN THAT WHICH I WOULD IMAGINE THEY ALL WOULD UNDER THAT SCENARIO. THEN THE FINANCING COULD BE USED FOR OTHER IDENTIFIED PROJECTS WITH IN- THAT AUDIT- AND TO ALLOW THE HOMEOWNER THAN TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE. FOR THEM TO GET FINANCING FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT'S REALLY THE WHOLE GOAL OF THESE ENERGY AUDITS IS TO GIVE HOME OWNERS A LIST OF IMPROVEMENTS. AND AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR COSTS. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE COFFEE BEANS FROM THE ENERGY EFFICIENT PROGRAMS WILL BE ASKED PROMISED- AND WILL ALLOW IT TO BE AFFORDABLE THEN FOR THE HOMEOWNERS AND AGAIN THESE ENERGY AUDIT PROGRAMS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN THE BILL OF THE SPECIFIC ENERGY OUT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE NEEDED. DO YOU HAVE REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE WAY IN WHICH ARTISTS NEED TO BE DONE AND ENSURING THAT THEY ARE DONE IN A PROFESSIONAL. MANNER AND CONSISTENT WITH THAT THE REGULATIONS. AND TRAINING MANUALS THAT ARE PROVIDED. OKAY CENTER BUT THAT'S NOT YOUR BILL SAYS I'M SORRY THANK NOT WHAT YOUR BILL SAYS WELL I'M SO WHAT WHAT PART OF THE WHAT IS THIS MY BILL NOT SATISFY I JUST SAID THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO BE HANDLED ON- THE OFFICIALS IN THE HOME HAVING THAT IS THE REASON FOR MESSI THE PROGRAM SO THAT'S NOT EXACTLY YOUR DANCE WASN'T REALLY WITH AND WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO HER TESTIMONY- BOTH OKAY SO AS FAR AS WHAT I SAID IF I MIGHT HAVE PERMISSION YEAH- I SAID I DON'T KNOW I WOULD ASSUME THAT FRAUD ON THE MARKET- CLASSIC CONTRACTS PRODUCT EERIE. AND OTHER GENERAL LOTS OF APPLICABILITY WOULD APPLY TO ANY MISTAKE A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT IN AN ENERGY AUDIT I ASSUME WOULD BE COVERED BY COMMON LAW CONTRACT FRAUD PRINCIPLES IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE BILL BUTTHAT OF COURSE WOULD BE MY UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OUR BILL WOULD INTERACT WITH EXISTING LAW AS FAR AS MISS PUTS THIS MONEY I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW IF AN ENERGY AUDIT SHOWS ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IN THE HOMEOWNER DECIDES TO WANT TO TAKE THEM UP I BELIEVE THE BILL WOULD GIVE LICENSE TO DO ANYTHING APPROPRIATE RIGHT- OPPOSITE THE AUDIT ITSELF WOULD COVER THE PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS. SO IF FOR EXAMPLE UNDER HER SCENARIO AND ENERGY AUDITOR CAME IN AND IN DECIDED THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE WINDOWS BUT THEY ALSO LOOK AT YOU KNOW MAYBE THE DOORS AND THE DRAFTY DOORS- AND INCLUDE AN ENERGY AUDIT WELL THAT NOW IS COVERED AS PART OF THE AUDIT WHETHER OR NOT WAS PAID FOR UP FRONT TO BE PAID FOR SO IF THE HOMEOWNER AND CONTRACTOR DECIDED P. PROCEED WITH PACE- I WOULD ASSUME THAT OULD WORK- IT DOESN'T SAY THAT IN THE BILL BUT I SEEM JUST THE WAY THE BILL WORKS. WITH EXISTING LAW THAT WOULD BE COVERED. REMINDS IS GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR UPS. I'M SORRY WHAT AND- JUDY FOR UP SELLING SO. THAT'S REFERENCE. IS RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE A LOT OF. YOU HAVE SOME. AND I'M A THERE'S A LOT HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF I MEAN WE CAN'T ASSUME WHEN WE'RE MAKING THE BILL. WE HAVE TO BE PRETTY CUT AND DRY AS WE DO THESE AND YES WE CAN DO A FOUNDATION AND ADD TO IT. SO I'M- NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PORTION OF IT- OKAY I THINK THAT'S MY QUESTION FOR RIGHT NOW YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OF I'D I'D I'D THINK THERE MAY BE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING HERE- MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT IT'S INDEPENDENT FROM- THOSE WHO WOULD PERFORM THE WORK. SO THERE WOULD BE NO MOTIVATION A MINUTE MAYBE I CAN ASK THIS QUESTION WOULD THERE BE. ANY MOTIVATION ON THE PART OF THE AUDITOR TO DO UP SELLING OF ANY SORT THE AUDITORS GOING TO GET PAID WHAT THE AUDITOR IS GOING TO GET PAID FOR PROVIDING A REPORT AND THAT'S IT. YEAH THAT WOULD BE THE WAY THAT THIS BILL IS WRITTEN IN THE AUDITOR IS INDEPENDENT AND IF YOU PAY THEM A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO DO A VERY LIMITED AUDIT I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO DO MORE THAN THE SCOPE OF THAT AUDIT- SO I DO THINK AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT ADDRESS YOUR CONCERNS CHAIR AGUIAR-CURRY. I DO THINK ALSO JUST HAVING THAT INFORMATION FROM A THIRD PARTY AS TO THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THIS THE COST SAVINGS THE POTENTIAL COSTS. THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT REGARDLESS OF YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE'S A IN ITS SENATE BY ANYONE TO UP SELL THAT'S INFORMATION YOU'RE ARMING THE CONSUMER WITH THAT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL IN DETERRING AND PREVENTING AGAIN THESE AGREE JUST TYPES OF FRAUD WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN THE STATE. THAT ARE IMPACTING- TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMS POINTS OUT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH VERY WELL IT REALLY IS TARGETING THE ELDERLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND- I YOU KNOW THAT FOR ME THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL IT'S A BILL THAT CAN HELP IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND- I APPRECIATED SOMEONE MEMORABLE POST COMMENTS AND I. DO HOPE YOU MAKE IT ANOTHER THIRTY YEAR SIR. I IF I. IF I. JUST I WOULD BE CONCERNED IF THE CHAIRS- COMMENTS ARE ARE ARE CORRECT- IF THERE WERE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AUDITOR TO SOMEHOW- INFLUENCE. WHAT THE- OF. THE DEPTH OF. THE PROJECT IN ANY WAY- I'D BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO IF THE BILL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO TIGHTEN UP THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT AND I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD AT A COMMITTEE I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE INCLUDING OPPOSITION TO TRY TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER- THE GOALS HERE ARE AGAIN TO CREATE A MEANINGFUL CHECK ON FRAUD. I WITH AN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO HAPPY TO MAKE THAT LANGUAGE CLEAR THAT IT MUST BE INDEPENDENT- I DO BELIEVE THAT IS ALREADY IN THE BILL BUT I WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK WILL TRY TO CLARIFY. AND ALLUSIVE DATE THAT MORE- TO SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS RAISED AROUND UPSELLING- WE WILL TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE- IF THIS BILL MOVES AT A COMMITTEE BUT BUT WE% ARE COMMITTED. TO MAKING A GOOD POLICY BILL HERE. SO IF YOU WANT. THE H. BACK. AND LOOK AT THE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER SAYS YOU NEED A NEW ROOF- THE CONTRACTORS HELP SELL FILLING UP SELLING YOU ON BOTH RIGHT. WELL I THINK THE WAY THIS BILL OPERATES THE AUDIT WOULD BE HAVE TO COVER THE ROOF FOR THE CONTRACTOR TO BE ABLE TO DO IT SO THAT THE CONTRACTOR CAME TO YOU AND SAID I HAVE AN H. BACK IMPROVEMENT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE DOING THAT. WOULD SEND YOU THAT LIVE NATION I CAN COME IN FOR YOU AND- BY THE WAY A ROOF CAN HELP TO AND- IT'S GONNA COST YOU ANYTHING IS GOVERNMENT FINANCE AND THEN YOU END UP WITH FIFTY THOUSAND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT GO TO SUPER PRIORITY LIEN. I WITH THIS AUDIT REQUIREMENT DO WOULD SAY THAT IF THE CONTRACTOR NEEDS TO GET AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT FOR ALL THE SCOPE OF PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS SO IF THEY DON'T COVER THE ROOF IF THAT'S NOT COVERED THE ARE THEY CAN'T DO IT THEN THEY IF THEY WANTED TO THE ROOF THEY HAVE TO GO GET ANOTHER ON IT- IF THAT MAKES SENSE AND SO I THINK THAT WOULD PREVENT THE TYPES OF- CERTAINLY DETERMINE THE TYPES OF UP SELLING THAT WE'RE SEEING- THAT RUN RAMPANT. IN THIS INDUSTRY. OKAY WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION AND I AM GOING TO SAY THOSE FROM OUR BOERNER HORVATH AND SECOND BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOW. WE DO- LIKE TO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK DR- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN- TRIANGULAR CURRY WANT TO THANK THE STAFF AGAIN FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL- NUMBERS FOR YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS IN THIS DISCUSSION AND I JUST WANT ARTICULATED AND THAT I AM COMMITTED TO MAKING THIS BILL BETTER SO I TAKE YOUR- DERRIUS COMMENTS TO HEART AND IF IT MOVED AS COMMITTEE I WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE AND I STAFF WILL REACH OUT TO. EACH YEAR STAFF INDIVIDUALLY TO DO THAT BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. I'M CENTER DRIVE TO WORKING ON PROTECTING PIT PAYS FOR CONSUMERS FOR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS I UNDERSTAND ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO. RAIN THESE UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS THAT ARE PLAYING THE PROGRAM. WELL PACE IT CERTAINLY NEEDS FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR THOSE WANTING TO MAKE THEIR HOMES GREENER AND MORE EFFICIENT. I TOLD YOU I'M CONCERNED BY ONE ASPECT OF YOUR PROPOSAL. AN ENERGY AUDIT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A USEFUL TO TOOL AND INSURING THE PROPERTY OWNERS ARE AWARE OF ANY INEFFICIENCY IN THEIR HOME. BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PROVISION IN YOUR BILL IS THE ANSWER. THE REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY APPLICANT TO THE PROGRAM PAY FOR IT BUT IT IS AN AND UNNECESSARY MANDATE. ESPECIALLY IF A PROJECT NEVER MOVES FORWARD. FURTHER BY RAISING ISSUES OUTSIDE OF OUR HOME WALKING OWNER MAY BE INVESTIGATING THE PROGRAM IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND A LOT OF MAY MAY EXACT ACTUALLY INVITE FURTHER PRESSURE. TO INCREASE THE SCOPE AND COST OF THE PROJECT IDENTIFYING ISSUES THE HOMEOWNER NEVER INTENDED TO ADDRESS. THIS COULD NOT ONLY STIFLE THE PROGRAM FOR HOMEOWNERS FOR WHOM IT MIGHT HAVE MERIT BUT LYNN THE CREDIBILITY. TO UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTOR TRYING TO PRESS A HOMEOWNER TO SPEND MORE. IT IS A REGRETTABLE THAT YOU CANNOT AGREE TO WORK TO FIND A MORE REASONABLE SOLUTION IN THE AUDIT ISSUE BUT WITHOUT THE AMENDMENT EVEN THEM THE EVEN WITH MORE OF WITH IMPORTANT PROTECTION LIKE REQUIRING. IT BACK IT LOOKS BUT XIN. I WILL NOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. YOU KNOW I OFFERED YOU A AMENDMENT AND I WISH SHE WOULD HAVE COUNTED OFFERED AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER FOR ME AND- MANY. OF THEM ARE NOT TO SPEAK FOR OTHERS BUT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TODAY AND I WISH YOU WOULD TAKE IN THE AMENDMENT. QUESTION IS DO PASSED TO THE BANKING. AND FINANCE COMMITTEE SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL AGUIAR-CURRY NO. AGUIAR-CURRY NO LACKEY. LACKEY NO BLOOM. WILL ARRIVE BOERNER HORVATH. ABOUT FIVE ALMOST. THIS RIVER STOPPED LOADING ROBERT RIVAS. ROBERT RIVAS NOT VOTING VOEPEL I FELT HI YOU HAVE THREE TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRED BY THE NUMBERS. OKAY. HUNDREDS THE BILL. OKAY LET'S SEE HERE REGARDLESS OF THE. LET'S SEE WERE RESERVED OF THEIR DEATH PAUL SP SKEWS ME ITEM NUMBER SIX S. B. TWELVE. WELCOME SENATOR MCGUIRE. SIX WHAT HAPPENED. THANK YOU. TWO HUNDRED OKAY. SENATOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN I APOLOGIZE THAT'S FINE THANK YOU I WAS SHOWING OFF A BABY PICTURE YEAH YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY THANK YOU SO MUCH. FIRST AND FOREMOST AT MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR IS SINCERE ENGAGEMENT- INTO YOUR AMAZING STAFF TEAM AT ANGELA'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO WORK WITH AND JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AND I WANNA SAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE- YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH WITH WILDLAND FIRES IN YOUR DISTRICT THAT WE SHARE YEAH AND GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TENACITY ON BEHALF OF THE RESIDENTS. AND I WANT TO THANK TO LISTEN. ROB RIVAS CO AUTHOR. OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SNOWMAN. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY ARGUMENT THAT WERE LIVING IN A PRESS CITY TIMES WITH WILDFIRES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WILDFIRES IN THE STATE OF CHANGED. FOR LARGER AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE. RIGHT NOW THAN ANY OTHER TIME IN MODERN HISTORY. THAT NEW NORMAL THIS YEAR AND THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SENATE BILL TWELVE. WE KNOW THE TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS MUST CHANGE. WHAT IS ALWAYS WORK LIKE SIMPLY RELYING ON BUILDING MATERIALS TO WITHSTAND FIRE. NO LONGER WORKS IN THIS ERA MAKE IT FIRES. IN HERE'S WHAT OUR NEW NORMAL LOOKS LIKE. TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN HOMEOWNER PAYOUTS FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE NEW NORMAL MEANS IN THE LAST SIXTY YEARS. CALIFORNIA WAS BURNING ON AVERAGE SIXTY YEARS AGO. UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY. NOW IT'S NEARLY TWO MILLION ACRES EVERY YEAR AND THAT NUMBER WILL INCREASE WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RECORD FOR A MILLION ACRES FROM LAST YEAR. THE NEW NORMAL MEANS THAT ALMOST ALL THE LAND BURNING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- NOW IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES. FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE. THE NEW NORMAL MEANS OF THE CREEK CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE IS NOW INTERVENING WITH LAWSUITS ON TWO MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE. BECAUSE OF THE INADEQUACY OF FIRE SAFETY REVIEW IN THEIR SEQUEL REVIEW. IN THE THIRD SEPARATE LAWSUIT FOUND A MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAD AN INADEQUATE WILDFIRE SAFETY ASSESSMENT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED SENATE BILL TWELVE. IT SETS A MINIMUM FLOOR FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LARGEST FIRE RISK AREAS A CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN I JUST WANNA BE VERY CLEAR IT'S ONLY IN THE VERY FIVE I AM VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SO. CURRENT STATE STANDARDS ARE LIMITED TO THE BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENT FOR ROADS AND SIGNS IN FUEL BREAKS. SB SWELL SETS UP A TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS FOR THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO ESTABLISH BOLD NEW STANDARDS TO ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT AS A WHOLE. ARE DESIGNED TO WITH. STAND FIRE NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS WITHIN THOSE DEVELOPMENTS. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. NUMBER ONE- WELL THEN FIRE HAZARD ASSESSMENT IN MITIGATION PLAN WOULD NEED TO BE DEVELOPED. AND IT'S ON A TIERED STRUCTURE THE MORE YOU BUILD. THE MORE SANDERS WOULD BE INCLUDED. DEFENSIBLE SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OF FUEL MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED FUNDED AND IMPLEMENTED. VIA H. AWAY FUNDS WOULD NEED TO BE ESTABLISHED. YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE INGRESS AND EGRESS. AND A DEVELOPMENT LAYOUT THAT REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. HOWEVER THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES A STANDARD TO BE REASONABLE AND TO BE FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE FOR THE MAJORITY DEVELOPMENTS. THIS MEANS DESPITE WHAT SOME HAVE SAID COMING INTO THIS COMMITTEE. SB TWELVE. WILL NOT. SB TWELVE WILL NOT CREATE A BLANKET BAN ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS. CRUCIALLY THE STANDARDS ARE TIERED SET THE STANDARDS CAN INCREASINGLY STRONGER AS DEVELOPMENTS GET LARGER IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS AGAIN THIS IS ALL BUILT OFF OF COMMONSENSE. IT STRUCTURED THIS WAY BECAUSE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE PEOPLE INTO THE WILL BE HAVING MORE PEOPLE IN THE WILL BE MEANS THAT THERE IS MORE DANGER. THIS MEANS THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT BUT NOT SO COSTLY IS TO TOTALLY PREVENT DEVELOPMENT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING. NUMBER ONE WE'RE GONNA BE AND THEN IN THE BILL BEFORE THE NEXT COMMITTEE. TO CLARIFY THAT THE WILDFIRE REDUCTION STANDARDS ONLY APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS. SO WE'LL BE TAKING THAT IN ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND I BELIEVE THAT'S ON JULY TWELFTH DON'T QUOTE ME ON THE SPECIFIC DATE. BUT WILL BE TAKING THAT IN ASSEMBLY HOUSING. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE HEARD THAT SECTION SEVENTEEN OF THE BILL. COULD IMPACT THE BORDER FORCE USE REGULATORY AUTHORITY- THAT WAS NOT AT ALL OUR INTENTION. TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN I'LL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO REMOVE THE LINE QUOTE FROM THE PERIMETER. AT THIS WILL SATISFY CONCERNS AND I'M GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER THREE OF US FOR ADVANCING THESE CONCERNS AS WELL WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU SOMEONE OVER ON THIS. THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE. IN SENATE BILL TWELVE IS THE ONLY BILL THAT BALANCES THE NEED FOR NEW HOUSING. EVEN IN FIRE PRONE AREAS WITH FIRE SAFETY. NOW THE SENATE RIGHT HERE. TOO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST POLITICS HAS GOTTEN IN THE WAY OF DATA. DATA THE DATA SHOWS THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE BUILD IN THE WAY WE REBUILD IN CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE DON'T. CANDIDLY IN THIS IS WHAT I'VE SEEN SINCE MY TIME IN THE SENATE. IF WE DON'T MORE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IS GOING TO FOLLOW. SPEAKING SUPPORT LAUREN DIFFERENCE HERE IS ON THE LINE TO BE HALF OF AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. NO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE AND READ ON THE LINE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MEDICINE NUMBER BUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT I'M SORRY TO GO ON SO LONG. THANK YOU. ROOM MOTION FROM- BOERNER HORVATH AND THE SECOND PART. FROM MEMORY WITH. STOP IT. OKAY- OPERATOR WE ARE LOOKING FOR LAUREN THE VINCE VALENCIA AND KAREN REED. ALL SIGNS ARE OPEN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AREN'T ABLE I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO BE HERE AT OR ABOUT THE TWELFTH I WHICH WOULD MAKE A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES REGARDING PLANNING FOR IN PERMITTING DEVELOPMENT ON THE VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS- AS SENATOR MCGUIRE HAS. POINTED OUT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FACE ANOTHER VERY CHALLENGING WILDFIRES AHEAD PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF RECORD DRY CONDITIONS AND BADLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS NOW CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO FACE RECORD BREAKING DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY WILDFIRES THAT HAVE BECOME THE STATE'S NEW NORMAL AND SO ENSURING JURISDICTIONS WILL NEED TO DO MORE TO BE BETTER PREPARED. PLANNING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY HAS LONG BEEN ON THE TOP OF THE. LINE FOR THE PLANNING PROFESSION. OVER THE LAST YEARS IT'S BECOME CLEAR. THAT BOTH THE STEPS WILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN DOWN TO BETTER PREPARE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESILIENT WAYS. THIS MEANS THREE CAPTAIN HOW LAND USE PLANNING AND DONE ANY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING NOT RANKED STRONGER BUILDING STANDARDS COORDINATING WITH STATE AGENCIES. AND ENSURING THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SUPPORTED WITH GUIDANCE AND FUNDING TO HELP MAKE THESE CRITICAL CHANGES AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE THOUGHT THAT. A PEACE ACCORDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WILDFIRE PRODUCTION STANDARDS UPON YOUR REQUIREMENTS THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING HOMES THE CARD NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED. AND DEVELOPED IN MCNEESE STANDARDS THAT ARE REASONABLE AND FEASIBLE THAT WILL PROTECT NOT. JUST PROPERTY BUT PEOPLE BY. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT SB TWELVE THE CAL HOW PRAYER BY ENCOURAGING MARKETS. HALLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES. APPROPRIATELY DESIGNING COMMUNITIES IN HIGH RISK AREAS AND WHERE POSSIBLE REASONS- REDIRECTING DENSITY PALAK HAZARDOUS AREAS WITH IN A JURISDICTION. ALL OF THIS WHILE IMPORTANTLY MAINTAINING THE STATE'S HOUSING PRODUCTION TARGETS FOR EACH REGION TO ENSURE THAT THE NEED TO DEVELOP DOES NOT KEEP HOUSING FROM BEING DEVELOPED BUT GIVE ME THE NEED TO DEVELOP SAFELY DOES NOT KEEP HOUSING. BEING DEVELOPED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE GREATLY APPRECIATE CENTER MAGUIRE'S TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THIS ISSUE. AND ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ERIN READ- KILEY RIVETING CAL FIVE LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE. WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS BILL HIS EXPLANATION WAS VERY THOROUGH- THIS WOULD ADD A LITTLE BIT TO IT- THERE'S A REASON WHY THE CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS- OVERWORKED ENTERAGAM ONE. BUT ONCE AGAIN WORKING TWENTY EIGHT DAYS STRAIGHT WITHOUT A DAY OFF THEY MIGHT GET ONE DAY OFF. AND THEN WORK ANOTHER MONTH- THEY'RE EXHAUSTED- LOCLE PLANNING IS A MAJOR CAUSE. OF THE PROBLEM- SENATOR BOB WEIR HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE WITH S. B. TWELVE AND IN OTHER IMPORTANT WAYS AS WELL- HE'S BEEN A TRUE LEADER IN RESOLVING LONGSTANDING WILDFIRE ISSUES- AND WE COMMEND HIM FOR HIS WORK- THE BILL IS IMPORTANT PART OF. HIS EFFORTS TO MAKE OUR STATE SAFER FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR THEIR OVERLOOKED FIREFIGHTERS WERE OUT THERE EVERY DAY- THEY HAVE BEEN ALL OVER ONE THOUSAND HOURS. MORE THIS YEAR THAN THEY WERE THIS TIME LAST YEAR FOUR THOUSAND MORE FIRES- TODAY- SO IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND AGAIN WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS. COMMONSENSE BILL- THAT WILL HELP US IN IN LARGE WAYS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU APPROVE SB TWELVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW MOVE INTO OPPOSITION WE HAVE ONE IN PERSON SILVIO. YOUR FURRY- CALIFORNIA BUILDERS AND INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION PERCENT THEN THERE WILL HAVE YELLOW GARBAGE- FROM THE BOARD THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION REALTORS WILL BE ON THE PHONE. SO WELCOME SYLVIA THANK YOU IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE IN PERSON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SILVIO FERRARI MAP THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- CAN YOU HEAR ME. OK THANK YOU- HERE IN OPPOSITION- I'VE SAID THIS IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS AS SAY IT AGAIN WE COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WILDFIRES ARE GETTING WORSE WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GETTING. MORE FREQUENT MORE INTENSIVE MORE DESTRUCTIVE WE SEE IT WE KNOW IT WE'RE ALL LIVING WITH IT- HOWEVER WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE SOLUTION- IS TO IMPLEMENT A FIRE REGIME THAT HAS THE PRACTICAL IMPACT THE REAL WORLD IMPACT. OF TAKING HUGE SWATHS OF LAND OFF THE TABLE FOR HOUSING THAT ARTIFICIALLY DRIVES UP THE COST TO HOUSING IN THE EXISTING AREAS WE ALREADY HAVE RENTS WE ALREADY HAVE HOUSING COSTS THAT ARE TOO HIGH. AND LIMITING THE OPTIONS FOR THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS WHO CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD TO LIVE IN THESE NEW MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITIES- THAT'S NOT WISE WE DON'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE DOING DOING THAT AT THIS TIME. YOU KNOW CLEARLY AND I HEARD AUTHOR LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT SCIENCE AND DATA I WOULD SAY WE TO BELIEVE THAT THE SCIENCE AND DATA IS ON OUR SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITIES WE HAVE. SEEN MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITY AFTER MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITY TESTED WILDFIRE TESTED WITHOUT A SINGLE STRUCTURE LOSS WITHOUT A SINGLE LOSS OF LIFE. MOST OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE KEEP REFERRING TO AN HEARING ABOUT ARE NOT NEW MASTER PLANNED COMMUNITIES- WE BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WORKING AND MAYBE WHAT'S REALLY NEEDED IS TO SIT AROUND A TABLE. NOW WE CAN ACTUALLY KIND OF ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND DAM IN DEMONSTRATING WALK THROUGH AND TALK ABOUT THIS AND GET IT OUT ON THE TABLE OUT IN THE OPEN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN AROUND THE TABLE. VIRTUALLY SINCE LATE JANUARY AND NOW THAT WE'RE IN THE SECOND HOUSE WE JUST REALLY FEEL LIKE WE GOT TO PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL. AND LAND SOME OF THESE OUTSTANDING BIG TICKET CONCERNS I MEAN FOR OF- THAT'LL JUST ARTICULATE TO YOU QUICKLY THE FIRST TWO ARE REALLY KIND OF VERSION OF THE SAME THEME. BUT THEY HAVE TO DO WITH WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED OF YOU AT THE TIME YOU'RE PULLING A BUILDING PERMIT. SO YOU ARE STANDING THERE READY TO CONSTRUCT A HOME EVERYTHING ON THE FRONT END HAS BEEN DONE THE INFRASTRUCTURE'S BEEN DONE THE DEVELOPMENT IS DESIGNED ROADS ARE IN SEWARD IT'S AN- YOU'RE PULLING A PERMIT. WE NEED TO MAKE ABSOLUTE CERTAIN AT THIS BILL DOES NOT. REACH TRIGGER A SECOND BITE OF THE APPLE SEQUEL WE CANNOT AFFORD THAT IS A DEATH NAILED TO ANY PROJECT MOVING FORWARD. ON THE SAME LINE OF THINKING THIRTY FOR REQUIREMENTS OF RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS. NUMEROUS PRODUCTION STANDARDS ON THE HORIZONTAL STUFF CANNOT BE RE TRIGGERED CANNOT BE INCORPORATED. THE BILL ALSO STATE SPECIFICALLY THAT STANDARDS REGULATIONS ADOPTED MUST BE REASONABLE FEASIBLE ACHIEVABLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT MEANS FORTY NINE PERCENT. OF THE PROJECTS IN AND IN A REGION CAN BE ON REASONABLE UNFEASIBLE UNACHIEVABLE WE NEED TO FIX THAT. AND LASTLY I'VE HARPED ON OPR FOR MONTHS. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- PR CANNOT TRUMP THE FIRE EXPERTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEIR ACTIVITY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ANOTHER ON YELLING PERFECT. ON THE PHONE PLEASE START THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY GOT RECKONED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OUR ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS THAT LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY REPRESENT MEANING THAT MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ALONG WITH THEIR FRIENDS FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES DUE TO RECENT WILDFIRES.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR A- IN THIS- IMPORTANT- BILL FORWARD I THINK WE TALK ABOUT THE FIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT THEIR TIME EVERY YEAR. BUT WE ALSO. NOTE THAT FIREFIGHTERS PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE OUT THERE DAY AND NIGHT FOR US. SO WE KNOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO MOVE FORWARD. IN THE PROTECTION OF PREVENTIVE THIS UP TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN- FIREFIGHTERS ARE CALLED INTO ACTION THAT THERE'S- DEFENSIBLE SPACES IN THOSE THINGS THAT ARE THERE. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO BRING THE STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY HAVE. FORWARD TO TRY TO FIND THAT BALANCE IT'S THERE. THIS BILL- STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD- IN THAT IN THAT MANNER- MAKING SURE THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE OUT THERE AND EQUIPPED AND THEY HAVE THE VOICE IN THE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE'S- ACTION THAT'S DONE PRIOR TO THE CALLING NINE ONE ONE AND THEY RESPOND AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES START TO DO SOME OF THAT PREVENTIVE MISFITS THERE. HOWEVER THERE IS SOME SERIOUS- CONCERNS FROM THOSE THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT DIALOGUE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. WE KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE VOICES ARE BEING HEARD. AS FAR AS THE HOUSING AS FAR AS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ALLUDED TO. I JUST WANTED TO GET THAT COMMITMENT FROM ROM THE CENTER THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO MOVE FORWARD IN THAT. HOW 2% SO NUMBER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND VERY GRATEFUL- YES 1100% COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION I THINK THAT IS. GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WERE TAKING A MEANS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE THAT I DO BELIEVE. THAT NOT THAT CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I DON'T WANT TO. SAY THAT BUT- THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING IN THE UPCOMING COMMITTEE THAT WILL ALLEVIATE CONCERNS- AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK. ON ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS YOU HAVE MY WORD ON THAT- ALONG WITH THE CHAIR AND SOMETHING TO CHEER ALSO. DISCUSSES WHETHER WE CONTINUE TO MEET. WITH OPPOSITION AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT THE ENTIRE TIME AND I WILL CONTINUE TO THAT NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR I'M VERY GRATEFUL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE. A LOT OF WORK ON THIS BILL AND I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH MY OFFICE AROUND- SOME AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU IN. GREAT GREAT AWESOME THE NUMBER AND WE WILL BE TAKING THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE OUT- IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND ALONG WITH THIS MEMORY IN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT AS ALWAYS MADISON THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE HARD WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THAT. AND INTO THIS BILL- I SUPPORTED A STRICTER- A MEASURE THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR- SO I GUESS THAT TELLS YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. OF WHERE I STAND AND- I THINK YOU'D BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND TO- A MORE VOCIFEROUS- ADVOCATE FOR- BUILDING. MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT WE DO HAVE TO BE. VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AT THE SAME TIME- WE HAVE- EXPERIENCE TO A WILDFIRE AFTER WILDFIRE AFTER WILDFIRE AND SEEN- THE TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES AND I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- BETTER BUILDING STANDARDS- ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING AGAINST A FIVE- BUT IT'S NOT JUST BUILDING STANDARDS WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT INGRESS AND EGRESS AND I KNOW SENATOR- YOU'VE BEEN TO THE INCIDENT COMMAND YOU BEEN TAKEN OUT OF ON TOURS LIKE I HAVE WITH THE SCENES OF SOME OF THE WORST FIRES AND- IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS YOU'VE SEEN THE- BURNT OUT CARCASSES OF- VEHICLES IN. PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE PERISHED AS A RESULT OF- THERE BEING A LACK OF ABILITY TO GET OUT AND HOW IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR FIRE SERVICES TO GET IN TO- AND EMERGENCY SERVICES TO GET IN TO VERY AS FAR AS- SO THESE ARE EXTREMELY M. AND- IMPORTANT- ISSUES. AND AGAIN I THINK THE BETTER STANDARDS DO OFFER SOME PROTECTION- AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE FOR- FOR- REBUILDS AND REMODELS. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE. VERY CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING BLANKET STATEMENTS ABOUT JUST YOU KNOW THAT WE WOULD- LOCATE NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN HARM'S WAY- AND I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED THAT WE NOT HEAD DOWN THAT PATH I DON'T THINK YOUR BILL IS INTENDING TO DO THAT- IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM- AND I THINK THAT- THE BILL'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. OVER WHAT THE LAW IS TODAY- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL I DO HAVE FIVE ONE REMAINING ISSUE THAT WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT BRIEFLY AND- THAT IS WHETHER- I THIS BILL- SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES ISSUES I THINK IT'S CLEAR- AND- I'LL ASK YOU TO CLARIFY AGAIN THAT- OF THE BILL- DOES NOT. ADDRESS COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES OTHER THAN IN A MIXED USE TYPE OF CONTEXT- BUT- SCHOOLS AND- UNIVERSITIES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AND- ONE AREA THAT I REPRESENT ARE NOT COVERED. AND I WILL JUST SAY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC IN THE CASE OF THE ONE UNIVERSITY THAT I KNOW OF THAT EXISTS AND- THE- HIGH FIRA HAZARDS. STONE THAT WOULD BE PEPPERED NINE- THEY HAVE- IN MY DISTRICT TO IMPLEMENTED- THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF FIRE PROTECTION AND OF WITHSTOOD SEVERAL- FIRES THAT HAVE COME THROUGH THE AREA- BUT THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO- OF THE SUBJECT TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD AS A RESULT OF THE BILL WHAT THEY'RE- ALREADY DOING AND- YOU'VE OFFERED TO WORK WITH MY OFFICE AND MYSELF TO. CLARIFY. AT THAT ENSURING FOR **** THAT. THROUGH THE CHAIR. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FANFARE DOUBT FOR SOME PHARMACISTS IN THEIR BLOOM IS BEEN CHAMPION IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND- FIRE PREVENTION- IN AS WELL AS FIREFIGHTERS AT THROUGH HIS ROLE IN BUDGETS UP AND JUST WANNA TAKE MOM TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT. I BECAUSE NOT ONLY YOU FOCUS ON HOUSING SIR YOU'RE ALSO FOCUS ON FIRE PREVENTION IN THE IMPACT IT IS HAVING A DISTRICT IS ONE AYE AYE PUBLICLY SAY THANK YOU ON THAT- SO WE WILL BE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HOUSING. IT WILL ONLY BE FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF HOUSING THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL PRECLUDES COMMERCIAL- BUT IT WOULD TAKE IN IN THIS CURRENT VERSION NOW WOULD TAKE IN- OTHER FORMS OF DEVELOPMENT. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IN SENATE HOUSING IS CLARIFYING. THAT THIS BILLS ONLY FOCUS ON HOUSING. NOW THAT WOULD STILL MEAN STUDENT HOUSING WOULD BE IN THE BILL AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GET FURTHER INFORMATION WITH YOU ON AND WORK WITH YOU. AS WE MOVE THANK YOU HAVE A STUDENT HOUSING WAS PROBABLY NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. IT IN THE CONTEXT OF HOUSING GENERALLY SO I APPRECIATE THAT NO 100% SIR IN THE FOUR TO OUR ON GOING DIALOGUE AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE COMMON QUESTION SIR THANK YOU.

THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ENTITY MAY REQUEST AN AUDIT OF THOSE FUND ACCOUNTS AT THE AGENCIES EXPENSE UNFORTUNATELY THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT IS NOT DEFINED. AND INTERPRETATION BY A LOCAL AGENCY COULD LIMIT THE AUDIT TO ONE YEAR OR THREE HOWEVER IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THE SUBJECT AGENCY HAS FAILED TO COMPLY FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS BEFORE A FORMAL AUDIT OF THESE FUNDS IS REQUESTED. THIS BILL SIMPLY SEEKS TO FIX THIS BY REQUIRING AN ENTITY ON EACH YEAR THE AGENCY FAILED TO PROVIDE THOSE REPORTS THIS SIMPLE CHANGE WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ENSURE THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW IN QUESTION ANY NEW OR ADJUSTED FEES.
