00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:02.501 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES

00:25:00.632 --> 00:25:04.470 region:rollup2

00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.970 region:rollup2

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:10.242 region:rollup2
THAT ADDRESS CRITICAL FIRE LIFE

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:11.477 region:rollup2
SAFETY ISSUE STATEWIDE.

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:13.746 region:rollup2
ALL BUT ONE PROJECT WILL BE

00:25:11.477 --> 00:25:15.447 region:rollup2
FUNDED FROM THE PROP FIFTY ONE

00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:16.582 region:rollup2
ON SO RECENTLY PASSED.

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:18.350 region:rollup2
OVER ALL THESE PROJECTS WOULD

00:25:16.582 --> 00:25:20.119 region:rollup2
OBLIGATE APPROXIMATELY SIX

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.087 region:rollup2

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:30.029 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION HERE ON

00:25:27.659 --> 00:25:30.996 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION. SO THEY JUST

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:33.132 region:rollup2
GO INTO THAT THE.

00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:33.832 region:rollup2

ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS STATE

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.405 region:rollup2
WHY NOT JUST COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:40.839 region:rollup2
IS THAT FUNDS FOR NEW PROJECTS

00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:42.374 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE LIMITED TO ISSUES.

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:44.243 region:rollup2
SUCH AS FIRE LIFE SAFETY OR

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:46.779 region:rollup2
COURT MANDATES.

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:47.413 region:rollup2
BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT VIOLATES

00:25:46.779 --> 00:25:49.481 region:rollup2
SAFETY DOES NOT NEED TO BE THE

00:25:47.413 --> 00:25:51.316 region:rollup2
SOLE CRITERION FOR COMMUNITY

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:53.352 region:rollup2
COLLEGE PROJECTS. TO BE

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:55.320 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING. BUT I

00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:56.889 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.690 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE ADMINISTRATION

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:59.792 region:rollup2

OF WE BELIEVE THAT STATE

00:26:48.307 --> 00:26:51.143 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON

00:26:49.508 --> 00:26:53.212 region:rollup2
THOSE PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS THE

00:26:51.143 --> 00:26:54.413 region:rollup2

AND WE DON'T OF ANY PARTICULAR

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:05.290 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WITH THE PROJECT EVER

00:27:04.957 --> 00:27:06.859 region:rollup2
CHOSE THEM.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.393 region:rollup2
BY THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING

00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:09.962 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I'M ARE

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:11.763 region:rollup2
OUR MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE THE

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:13.465 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR FUNDS TO FEW PROJECTS

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:15.567 region:rollup2
I'M CONSIDERING THAT THE SIZE OF

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:16.268 region:rollup2
THE PROP FIFTY ONE BOND WHICH

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:17.669 region:rollup2
WAS TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:27:16.268 --> 00:27:18.403 region:rollup2
AND THE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:20.305 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET.

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:21.773 region:rollup2
AT UP TO ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT OF

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:24.142 region:rollup2
THE A COMMITTEE BECAUSE PROP

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:25.277 region:rollup2
FIFTY ONE I'M FUNDING SO WE

00:27:24.142 --> 00:27:26.912 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:28.547 region:rollup2
CONSIDER AUTHORIZING. A MORE

00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:30.749 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROJECTS AND

00:27:28.547 --> 00:27:31.850 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING A MULTI YEAR PLAN FOR

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:33.318 region:rollup2
SPENDING THOSE AND WE THINK THAT

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.120 region:rollup2
WOULD. HELP OUR CREE CERTAINLY

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:36.054 region:rollup2
FOR THE COLLEGES AND ENSURE THAT

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.855 region:rollup2
THE VOTER APPROVED BONDS ARE

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:39.191 region:rollup2
SPENT.

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:40.459 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WE WE

00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:42.261 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN REVIEWED THEIR YOUR

00:27:40.459 --> 00:27:44.096 region:rollup2
AGENDA INCLUDES. THE NINE

00:27:42.261 --> 00:27:45.864 region:rollup2
PROJECTS THAT THAT ARE THE

00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:46.465 region:rollup2
CHANCES OF WAS APPROVED THAT

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:48.734 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

00:27:46.465 --> 00:27:50.569 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET WE DON'T

00:27:48.734 --> 00:27:52.504 region:rollup2
WE DON'T REVIEW ALL THOSE TELL

00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:53.405 region:rollup2
YOU WHICH ONES YOU THINK ARE THE

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:55.307 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT YOU SHOULD.

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:56.542 region:rollup2
UNFUNDED WE DO THINK THAT THAT

00:27:55.307 --> 00:27:58.477 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.944 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE WE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:27:58.477 --> 00:27:59.344 region:rollup2
ADDING ADDITIONAL ONES

00:27:58.944 --> 00:28:00.145 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:01.213 region:rollup2
LET ME ASK YOU JUST A QUESTION

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:03.448 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE SO CERTAINLY WE SEE

00:28:01.213 --> 00:28:03.649 region:rollup2
THE LIST ON ON THE STAFF REPORT.

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:05.317 region:rollup2
AND.

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:06.552 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY ALL SEEM LIKE

00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:08.887 region:rollup2
WITHOUT PROJECTS ANOTHER MANY

00:28:06.552 --> 00:28:10.756 region:rollup2
OTHERS I'M JUST CONFUSED HOW

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:12.758 region:rollup2
COULD WE APPROVE THEM.

00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:14.226 region:rollup2
IF THE BONDS HAVE TO BE.

00:28:12.758 --> 00:28:15.727 region:rollup2
SOLD BY THE GOVERNOR SO HOW

00:28:14.226 --> 00:28:17.162 region:rollup2
DOES THAT HELP IF WE APPROVE IT

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:17.763 region:rollup2
BUT THE.

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:19.698 region:rollup2
COVER DOES NOT TAKE THE FINAL

00:28:17.763 --> 00:28:21.500 region:rollup2
ACTION.

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.968 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I GET TO. RIDE THE GOD

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.468 region:rollup2
IS ONE OF THE TOWNS DIDN'T NOT

00:28:22.968 --> 00:28:24.803 region:rollup2
NONE OF THIS CAN HAPPEN

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:26.104 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY YET UNILATERALLY I

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:28.173 region:rollup2
THINK THERE IS. THAT THE

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:29.341 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CABIN IN THE BUDGET

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:31.310 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:33.579 region:rollup2
BOND FUNDS FIVE FOR THIS

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.581 region:rollup2
PURPOSE BUT IT DOES REQUIRE THEN

00:28:33.579 --> 00:28:36.181 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATION YOU KNOW THAT

00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:37.783 region:rollup2
THAT THAT TURNED TO SELL THESE

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:39.985 region:rollup2
BONDS SO THERE DOES NEED TO BE

00:28:37.783 --> 00:28:42.187 region:rollup2
SOME COORDINATION. INVOLVED ARM

00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:43.288 region:rollup2
IN AND AND I THINK IF I'M THAT

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:44.856 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE THE

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:46.491 region:rollup2
THE TIME THAT WE DO THINK THAT

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:48.994 region:rollup2
IF YOU YOU DO ADD. BUT THE BILL

00:28:46.491 --> 00:28:51.129 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE OR OTHER LANGUAGE THAT

00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:52.064 region:rollup2
MAKES VERY CLEAR YOUR INTENT BUT

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.664 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

00:28:52.064 --> 00:28:54.900 region:rollup2
COULD BE GREENER.

00:28:52.664 --> 00:28:59.404 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY THAT THESE PROJECTS

00:28:54.900 --> 00:29:01.306 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ULTIMATELY APPROVED

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:03.041 region:rollup2
UNFUNDED I'M TO THE PROCESS.

00:29:01.306 --> 00:29:03.909 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M SO IF I CAN JUST ADD ON

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.344 region:rollup2
THAT

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:05.744 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THE PROJECTS LISTED

00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:06.445 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T DON'T.

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.212 region:rollup2
.

COUNTS.

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:09.741 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO DO SO WILL NEED A

00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:11.542 region:rollup2
MECHANISM TO ADJUST OUR

00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:11.809 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT SPIT LE AS THOSE

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.978 region:rollup2

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:16.848 region:rollup2
COURSE OF THE YEAR OF THE

00:40:16.014 --> 00:40:17.615 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN THE THEIR

00:40:16.848 --> 00:40:19.217 region:rollup2
PROPRIOCEPTIVE.

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:20.585 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:40:19.217 --> 00:40:21.319 region:rollup2

00:40:28.593 --> 00:40:30.795 region:rollup2
VERY PLEASED BY THIS I THINK

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.797 region:rollup2
IT'S A. GAME CHANGER MAKING

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:34.866 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

GRAD STUDENTS COULD GO GET THE.

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.803 region:rollup2
FORMALLY BOB WEAVER BUT THE

00:40:38.403 --> 00:40:40.438 region:rollup2
YEARS I THINK THIS

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:42.240 region:rollup2
THE GREAT.

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:43.708 region:rollup2
MARKETING OPPORTUNITY TALK

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.676 region:rollup2
ABOUT COLLEGE PEOPLE WHO. MAYBE

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:46.344 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY WERE SITTING ON THE

00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:47.478 region:rollup2
SIDELINES WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT

00:40:46.344 --> 00:40:49.347 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY IN ONLINE DISCUSS WE

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:51.115 region:rollup2
NEED TO GET.

00:40:49.347 --> 00:40:52.684 region:rollup2
STRANDED POPULATION AS FAR AS

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:54.085 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION BACK IN THE

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:55.053 region:rollup2
GAME IN A ROLLING IN THE

00:40:54.085 --> 00:40:56.521 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BECAUSE I THINK THIS

00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:59.824 region:rollup2
HAS. A TREMENDOUS.

00:40:56.521 --> 00:41:00.692 region:rollup2
UPSIDE AND I DID WANT TO ASK

00:40:59.824 --> 00:41:02.360 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

00:41:00.692 --> 00:41:04.262 region:rollup2
THE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT WERE

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.563 region:rollup2
LAID OUT IN THAT LEGISLATION OF

00:41:04.262 --> 00:41:08.366 region:rollup2
COURSE SO.

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:09.634 region:rollup2
I HAVE HAD HOW. HOW DO YOU

00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:11.436 region:rollup2
FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT?

00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:14.572 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE

00:41:11.436 --> 00:41:15.907 region:rollup2
AND COMPLETED THE ACTIVITIES

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:17.008 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS ELSA BELIEVES IN THAT

00:41:15.907 --> 00:41:18.142 region:rollup2
KIND OF THINK THAT NUMBER ONE

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:19.344 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER TWO. IS IT PER THE

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:20.778 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:22.246 region:rollup2
DISTRICT OR THE ACTUAL

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:23.981 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL COLLEGE.

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:26.718 region:rollup2
.

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:27.719 region:rollup2
THE OUR INTENT RIGHT NOW WE'VE

00:41:26.718 --> 00:41:29.153 region:rollup2
BEEN AYE TRACKING ON A COLLEGE

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:31.155 region:rollup2
BASIS.

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.923 region:rollup2
AND SO COLLEGES I THINK THE TWO

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.990 region:rollup2
THAT ARE.

00:41:31.923 --> 00:41:35.259 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.161 region:rollup2
OF PRIMARY CONCERN HAVE BEEN

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:38.329 region:rollup2
AROUND THE PARTICIPATION IN THE

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.665 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAM.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:42.100 region:rollup2
AS A HAVE THE UPDATE I RECEIVE

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:44.435 region:rollup2
TODAY THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.169 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO COLLEGES I CAN SYSTEM

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.704 region:rollup2
OF YOUR AGENDA THAT.

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:48.573 region:rollup2
JIM DON'T CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:49.707 region:rollup2
IN THE LOAN PROGRAM I THINK MOST

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:51.275 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ARE EXPLORING

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:52.243 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION BUT WILL CONTINUE

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:54.345 region:rollup2
TO MONITOR THAT AND WE'RE HAPPY

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:55.146 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE YOU. WITH UPDATED

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:55.880 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IS THAT MOVES

00:41:55.146 --> 00:41:57.515 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.083 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ONE THAT IS

00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:00.218 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO US IS

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.919 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IN THE GUIDED

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:03.488 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS STRUCTURE THE FRAY OFF

00:42:01.919 --> 00:42:04.622 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THAT FRAMEWORK. OF AT

00:42:03.488 --> 00:42:05.857 region:rollup2
THIS POINT MOST CALL IT ALL

00:42:04.622 --> 00:42:06.090 region:rollup2
COLLEGES HAVE INDICATED THAT

00:42:05.857 --> 00:42:07.525 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.394 region:rollup2
GOING DOWN THAT PATH I THINK

00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:11.028 region:rollup2
THE EXPECTATIONS WILL CONTINUE

00:42:09.394 --> 00:42:12.096 region:rollup2
TO GROW MOVING FORWARD AND SO

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:13.164 region:rollup2
WILL WE'RE GONNA BE MONITORING

00:42:12.096 --> 00:42:14.932 region:rollup2
THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S AN

00:42:13.164 --> 00:42:16.401 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS THAT. AS

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.835 region:rollup2
WE BUILD AND.

00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:19.003 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COLLEGE PROMISE

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:20.071 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I THINK ONE OF THE

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:21.572 region:rollup2
THINGS WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE

00:42:20.071 --> 00:42:23.674 region:rollup2
SURE THAT STUDENTS WHO ENTER.

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:25.243 region:rollup2
ON A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS SO. I

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:25.843 region:rollup2
THINK WE WE SEE THAT IS CRITICAL

00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:27.311 region:rollup2
TO THE PROGRAM WE THINK WE'RE

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:30.281 region:rollup2
ON.

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:30.715 region:rollup2
GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH WE'RE

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.682 region:rollup2
GONNA MONITOR THAT.

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:32.583 region:rollup2
SO THE ONLY THAT ACTIVITY THAT

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:34.585 region:rollup2
MAYBE QUESTION RIGHT NOW ARE

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:36.521 region:rollup2
THESE COLLEGES THAT THAT HAVE

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:39.157 region:rollup2
NOT PARTICIPATED WITH THAT.

00:42:36.521 --> 00:42:40.324 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LOAN THAT'S CORRECT AND

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.527 region:rollup2
JUST JUST MAYBE COULDN'T HELP US

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:43.561 region:rollup2
WHY WOULD A COLLEGE.

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:45.163 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS ALL

00:42:43.561 --> 00:42:47.698 region:rollup2
THESE YEARS.

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:49.834 region:rollup2
THIS IS ANECDOTAL AND CERTAINLY.

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.868 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HAVEN'T TALKED BROADLY

00:42:49.834 --> 00:42:52.170 region:rollup2
ENOUGH I THINK.

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:55.306 region:rollup2
ONE IS KIND OF.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2
BELIEFS ABOUT LOANS AND AND I

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:56.941 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:58.810 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:59.744 region:rollup2
LOAN PRACTICES AND WHAT THAT

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.412 region:rollup2
MEANS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:42:59.744 --> 00:43:03.247 region:rollup2
STUDENT I THINK THE OTHER.

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:04.215 region:rollup2
IS ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S TIED

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.583 region:rollup2
TO PRODUCE MISSION IN THE

00:43:04.215 --> 00:43:07.251 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LOAN PROGRAMS AND NOT.

00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:09.620 region:rollup2
.

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:10.955 region:rollup2
NOT WANTING SAID TO TAKE ON.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.356 region:rollup2
.

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:13.324 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE A POPULATION OF

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:13.758 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING A LOANS

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:15.927 region:rollup2
WHERE.

00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:17.829 region:rollup2
COHORT DEFAULT RATES ARE USED

00:43:15.927 --> 00:43:19.397 region:rollup2
AS A MEASURE OF INSTITUTIONAL

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:20.431 region:rollup2
SUCCESS I THINK THE THIRD PART

00:43:19.397 --> 00:43:23.101 region:rollup2
IS ALSO JUST THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:24.969 region:rollup2
COSTS OF.

00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:26.370 region:rollup2
SPENDING THE LOAN PROGRAM.

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.938 region:rollup2
LOANS ARE AREN'T ALWAYS PROUD

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.239 region:rollup2
LED THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE AS

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.740 region:rollup2
MUCH AS

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:32.076 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THIS IS HERE PRAISE

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.077 region:rollup2
APPLE IT JUST WASN'T A PRIORITY.

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:35.813 region:rollup2
BUT AND AND I THINK THE I THINK

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:38.182 region:rollup2
THE BE BIGGER ISSUE IS PROBABLY

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:39.317 region:rollup2
THAT IT CREATES BURDENS BOTH ON.

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:40.785 region:rollup2
THE CAN OF A WORKLOAD STAFFING

00:43:39.317 --> 00:43:43.221 region:rollup2
BURDEN BUT ALSO IN A.

00:43:40.785 --> 00:43:44.956 region:rollup2
A CONCERN THAT INSTITUTIONS WHO

00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:45.723 region:rollup2
HAVE HIGH COHORT DEFAULT RATES.

00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:46.090 region:rollup2
.

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:48.993 region:rollup2
LIKE.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.561 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PUT POLICIES TIED TO

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:51.129 region:rollup2
TO THAT MEASURE AND SO WE COULD.

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:51.362 region:rollup2
GET THEM IN TROUBLE FOR THE

00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:53.164 region:rollup2
PURPOSES

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:56.801 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:57.401 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS FOR MISTER OBERNOLTE.

00:43:56.801 --> 00:43:58.636 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HOW DO

00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:00.171 region:rollup2
WE.

00:43:58.636 --> 00:44:01.973 region:rollup2
YEAH MISS WALDRON.

00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:03.641 region:rollup2
SO I WAS INTERESTED TO READ IN

00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:05.409 region:rollup2
THE LA NEWS ANALYSIS OF THIS

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.911 region:rollup2
THEIR THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:08.513 region:rollup2
PERENNIAL TENSION BETWEEN.

00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:09.947 region:rollup2
WANTING TO GRAB MORE STUDENTS

00:44:08.513 --> 00:44:11.415 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:13.918 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND BUT ALSO NEEDING

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:14.852 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS ON THE

00:44:13.918 --> 00:44:17.221 region:rollup2
OTHER HAND BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:18.956 region:rollup2
DOES US NO GOOD AS A SOCIETY. TO

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:19.724 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE PEOPLE COME IN NOW IF

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:21.192 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:44:19.724 --> 00:44:22.927 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN WHAT THEY'RE

00:44:21.192 --> 00:44:24.061 region:rollup2
ENDEAVORING TO ACHIEVE SO I AND

00:44:22.927 --> 00:44:24.962 region:rollup2
WHAT AS YOU KNOW WE ALREADY

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:25.530 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITHOUT OF THE

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:26.497 region:rollup2
LIGHTED LATEST STATISTICS I

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:27.865 region:rollup2
READ.

00:44:26.497 --> 00:44:29.300 region:rollup2
SAY THAT FOR ONLY FORTY PERCENT

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:30.468 region:rollup2
AND PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS THAT

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.903 region:rollup2
COME IN EITHER.

00:44:30.468 --> 00:44:33.504 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE A TWO YEAR DEGREE.

00:44:31.903 --> 00:44:35.740 region:rollup2
IN AN EDUCATIONAL CERTIFICATE

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:38.042 region:rollup2
OR TRANSFER OUT TO HAVE HIGHER.

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:40.178 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION WITHIN SIX YEARS SO

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:42.213 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S. REALLY A

00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:44.015 region:rollup2
RED FLAG IN MY MIND AND SO FAR.

00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:45.349 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING HOW DO YOU ADDRESS

00:44:44.015 --> 00:44:47.885 region:rollup2
THOSE CONCERNS WHEN WE'RE

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:49.253 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A LARGE NEW INFLUX

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:51.689 region:rollup2
IN FIRST YEAR STUDENTS TO THE

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:53.324 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:54.659 region:rollup2
IF I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT YET I

00:44:53.324 --> 00:44:56.661 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS KIND OF YOU KNOW.

00:44:54.659 --> 00:44:57.228 region:rollup2
THEIR VISION FOR SEX SUCCESS

00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:58.563 region:rollup2
BECOMES KIND OF OUR HAS BEEN

00:44:57.228 --> 00:45:00.364 region:rollup2
OUR.

00:44:58.563 --> 00:45:01.599 region:rollup2
TENTATIVE YOU KNOW NORTH STAR

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:03.701 region:rollup2
OVER THE PASSING OF SINCE IT WAS

00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:04.936 region:rollup2
ADOPTED LAST YEAR I THINK THAT'S

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:06.204 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I. I THINK WE WOULD SAY

00:45:04.936 --> 00:45:07.738 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SEE THESE TWO

00:45:06.204 --> 00:45:08.639 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES AS INTENTION THAT I

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.907 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:11.475 region:rollup2
ACCESS IS IMPORTANT IT'S

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:12.243 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY BEEN IMPORTANT AS

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.777 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AS PART OF A MASTER

00:45:12.243 --> 00:45:14.679 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:15.346 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND WE

00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:17.982 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:45:15.346 --> 00:45:20.251 region:rollup2
THERE WE HAVE MADE OUR CORE.

00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:20.885 region:rollup2
OUT MISSION OVER THE NEXT COMING

00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:22.587 region:rollup2
YEARS IN THIS CHANCELLOR HAS

00:45:20.885 --> 00:45:25.122 region:rollup2
MADE HIS CORE MISSION TO ADDRESS

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:26.991 region:rollup2
THESE. CHALLENGES OF STUDENT

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:28.593 region:rollup2
SUCCESS THAT IT'S YOU KNOW OUR

00:45:26.991 --> 00:45:30.227 region:rollup2
VISION FOR SUCCESS SCHOOLS ORDER

00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:31.562 region:rollup2
INCREASE TRANSFERRING COMPLETE

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:33.764 region:rollup2
DIED INCREASED COMPLETIONS DE

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:34.765 region:rollup2
PEOPLE INTO THE WORKFORCE AND.

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:36.534 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT ARE.

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:38.569 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PROGRAM

00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:39.103 region:rollup2
OF STUDY AND CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:41.505 region:rollup2
GAPS BOTH.

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:43.674 region:rollup2
ACROSS A STUDENT.

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:44.275 region:rollup2
RACIAL ETHNIC GROUPS BUT ACROSS

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:46.611 region:rollup2
ALSO.

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:49.013 region:rollup2
REGION SO I THINK THIS IS KIND

00:45:46.611 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
OF A CENTRAL PART OF THIS GUIDED

00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:51.215 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:53.751 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:55.453 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STRUCTURED OUR SYSTEM

00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:58.222 region:rollup2
TO DEATH THERE THAT ARE YOU KNOW

00:45:55.453 --> 00:45:59.290 region:rollup2
GUIDED PATHWAYS IS THAT IT'S AN

00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:00.258 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT TO MOVE FROM.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.758 region:rollup2
THE KIND OF AYE CAFETERIA STYLE

00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:03.227 region:rollup2
MODEL OF OF EDUCATIONAL

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:04.996 region:rollup2
DELIVERY.

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:06.097 region:rollup2
TO ONE THAT IS FOCUSED ON

00:46:04.996 --> 00:46:08.466 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WITH THE STUDENTS

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:09.967 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL GOAL IS UPON ENTRY.

00:46:08.466 --> 00:46:10.935 region:rollup2
CREATING A PATHWAY FOR THEM TO

00:46:09.967 --> 00:46:12.970 region:rollup2
GET THEIR PROVIDING THE SPORTS

00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:14.271 region:rollup2
THING NEED TO DO THAT SO THAT SO

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:15.573 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THIS IS OUR THAT IS

00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:16.774 region:rollup2
OUR CENTRAL MISSION I THINK

00:46:15.573 --> 00:46:18.142 region:rollup2
GETTING MORE FOLKS THROUGH THE

00:46:16.774 --> 00:46:20.378 region:rollup2
DOORS IS IMPORTANT BUT WE.

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:20.978 region:rollup2
WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE

00:46:20.378 --> 00:46:21.879 region:rollup2
THEY GET OUT WITH A WITH A DOT

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:22.680 region:rollup2
COM.

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:23.280 region:rollup2
BUT THE DEGREE CREDENTIAL

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.715 region:rollup2
TRANSFER.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.217 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOAL

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:27.285 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:28.753 region:rollup2
WELL I MEAN WE'RE ON THE SAME

00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:31.289 region:rollup2
TEAM OBVIOUSLY WE ALL WANT THE

00:46:28.753 --> 00:46:32.490 region:rollup2
SAME THING WHICH IS TO PROVIDE

00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:33.824 region:rollup2
THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.326 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY TO OUR COMMUNITY

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.727 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SYSTEM ON THE ONE HAND.

00:46:35.326 --> 00:46:38.296 region:rollup2
AND THE MAXIMUM SUCCESS FOR

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:40.464 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ON THE OTHER BUT.

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:42.633 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:44.201 region:rollup2
WITH YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THIS

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.869 region:rollup2
INFLUX OF NEW STUDENTS IS NOT

00:46:44.201 --> 00:46:45.936 region:rollup2
GOING TO AFFECT OUR SUCCESS RATE

00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:47.705 region:rollup2
IN FACT. IF YOU WANT MY

00:46:45.936 --> 00:46:48.739 region:rollup2
PREDICTION I THINK THAT THAT

00:46:47.705 --> 00:46:49.807 region:rollup2
READ THE FORTY SEVEN PERCENT

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:51.375 region:rollup2
RATE THAT I JUST COULD I THINK

00:46:49.807 --> 00:46:52.877 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA GO DOWN. AS A

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:54.211 region:rollup2
RESULT OF THIS INITIATIVE AND I

00:46:52.877 --> 00:46:55.680 region:rollup2
THINK IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL. THAT

00:46:54.211 --> 00:46:57.715 region:rollup2
IT'LL GO DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY SO I

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.950 region:rollup2
I MYSELF AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:46:57.715 --> 00:47:01.318 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE. THAT WE DON'T LOSE

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.787 region:rollup2
SIGHT OF THE THE OVERALL

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:03.921 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVE HERE WHICH IS NOT TO

00:47:02.787 --> 00:47:05.556 region:rollup2
HAVE A BUNCH A PEOPLE GO TO

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:06.891 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT TO HAVE

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:07.491 region:rollup2
THEM BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:47:06.891 --> 00:47:08.759 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WOMAN WHEN YOU'RE

00:47:07.491 --> 00:47:10.628 region:rollup2
GAUGING THE OVERALL HEALTH OF

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:11.162 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE SOCIETY

00:47:10.628 --> 00:47:12.730 region:rollup2
SOCIETAL BENEFIT THAT WERE

00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:14.465 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING. THAT SHOULD BE THE

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.132 region:rollup2
METRIC THAT WERE FOCUSED ON NOT

00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:16.334 region:rollup2
NUMB THE NUMBER FOR STUDENTS TO

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:17.768 region:rollup2
COME IN BUT THE NUMBER OF

00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.936 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO WHO LEAVE

00:47:17.768 --> 00:47:20.271 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY.

00:47:18.936 --> 00:47:21.639 region:rollup2
AND IT ALL AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:47:20.271 --> 00:47:22.940 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S THE

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.508 region:rollup2
METRIC WE OUGHT BE LOOKING AT.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.510 region:rollup2
SO IT A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:28.379 region:rollup2
THE OHIO. ON THE THE NEW FUNDING

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.347 region:rollup2
FORMULA DOES THIS HELP ADDRESS

00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:32.583 region:rollup2
YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE LINK

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:34.018 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THOSE TWO NUMBERS.

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.653 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE FUNDING

00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:37.188 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICAL WE THINK THAT IS A

00:47:35.653 --> 00:47:38.723 region:rollup2
WAY TO HELP ENSURE THAT

00:47:37.188 --> 00:47:39.557 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS WITH HAPPENING ON THE

00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:40.825 region:rollup2
IN ROOM INSIDE. KNOW WHETHER

00:47:39.557 --> 00:47:41.992 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY STUDENTS

00:47:40.825 --> 00:47:43.694 region:rollup2
ARE COMING AND WHETHER THEY'RE

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:45.162 region:rollup2
COMING IN BECAUSE OF VERY

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:46.664 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A FEW WAIVER OR.

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:48.032 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UNDER EIGHTEEN

00:47:46.664 --> 00:47:50.067 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WOULD NOW RECEIVE THE

00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:51.869 region:rollup2
WAIVER THAT WE DO HAVE A

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:54.271 region:rollup2
INSTANCES FOR COLLEGES TO REALLY

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:55.239 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON OUTCOMES SO. I THINK

00:47:54.271 --> 00:47:55.906 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:57.374 region:rollup2
WE DON'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:47:55.906 --> 00:47:58.275 region:rollup2
CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER WE WE

00:47:57.374 --> 00:48:00.077 region:rollup2
THINK IF YOU DO HAVE A FUNDING

00:47:58.275 --> 00:48:03.080 region:rollup2
FOR MY THAT'S MORE ALIGNED. TO.

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:04.582 region:rollup2

PROVIDING THE SUPPORT AND I

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:11.622 region:rollup2

IT SENSIBLE AND SUPPORTS THE

00:57:26.076 --> 00:57:29.079 region:rollup2
OF ALSO SAY THAT WE THINK IT'S

00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:30.447 region:rollup2
RES THAT'S A REASONABLE WAY TO

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:32.549 region:rollup2
SUPPORT CAPACITY BUILDING IN THE

00:57:44.261 --> 00:57:47.531 region:rollup2
FORMULA CHANGES. ARE TYPICALLY

00:57:46.396 --> 00:57:48.966 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE CAPACITY OF

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:50.133 region:rollup2
COLLEGES TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO

00:57:48.966 --> 00:57:51.802 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE CHANGES AND SO WE

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:52.402 region:rollup2
THINK THE INNOVATION WORDS CAN

00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:54.004 region:rollup2
HELP TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY.

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:55.972 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:57:54.004 --> 00:57:59.142 region:rollup2
THANK YOU. I LET ME START OUT

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:59.576 region:rollup2
WITH A QUESTION FOR FROM LA SO

AND THAT YOU GET THE SAME

00:58:05.749 --> 00:58:09.319 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION YOU HAD A YEARS BACK

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:10.687 region:rollup2
AND I THINK NOW IS STILL BE

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:12.289 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IS.

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:13.490 region:rollup2
IF YEARS AGO OVERTURE WHAT THEY

00:58:12.289 --> 00:58:14.458 region:rollup2
WOULD DO NOW THEY'VE DONE IT AND

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.026 region:rollup2
WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT'S

00:58:14.458 --> 00:58:17.194 region:rollup2
HAPPENING SO.

00:58:16.026 --> 00:58:18.595 region:rollup2
THE THE DESCRIPTION FROM THE

00:58:17.194 --> 00:58:20.130 region:rollup2
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:21.965 region:rollup2
BREAKTHROUGH PROJECTS

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.567 region:rollup2
REVOLUTIONARY PROJECTS.

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:25.202 region:rollup2
HAVE WE HAVE WE SEEN ANY OTHER

00:58:23.567 --> 00:58:26.570 region:rollup2
ONES IN LAST YEAR'S THAT THAT

00:58:25.202 --> 00:58:28.605 region:rollup2
THAT MEET UP WITH THAT. THOSE

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.172 region:rollup2
LOFTY GOALS

00:58:28.605 --> 00:58:30.640 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AND THE LIVING YET I

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:31.908 region:rollup2
THINK THERE PUT THE FOR THE

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.043 region:rollup2
FIRST RIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING OF

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:34.478 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ROUND OF INNOVATION

00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:35.545 region:rollup2
AWARDS WERE REALLY ABOUT. BROUGH

00:58:34.478 --> 00:58:37.347 region:rollup2
WORDING.

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:39.483 region:rollup2
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:40.784 region:rollup2
WERE ALREADY AND. HAD ALREADY

00:58:39.483 --> 00:58:41.952 region:rollup2
ADOPTED INNOVATIVE PRACTICES SO

00:58:40.784 --> 00:58:44.154 region:rollup2
THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE

00:58:41.952 --> 00:58:45.122 region:rollup2
THOUGHT. WE CHANGE I THINK THAT.

00:58:44.154 --> 00:58:46.189 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:58:45.122 --> 00:58:48.191 region:rollup2
FINANCES IN THE MYTH OF

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:50.994 region:rollup2
COMPILING I'M INFORMATION FROM

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:52.062 region:rollup2
THE THE FIRST ROUND OF. A

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:53.430 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT RECEIVED THE

00:58:52.062 --> 00:58:55.098 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AWARDS.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:56.600 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:57.534 region:rollup2
THAT IMPLEMENT SOMETHING NEW SO

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.669 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN SEEN ANYTHING QUITE

00:58:57.534 --> 00:59:00.737 region:rollup2
YET THAT GIVES US A SENSE OF?

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:02.339 region:rollup2
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE WORDS

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:03.173 region:rollup2
I AM WHAT THE OUTCOMES BEEN AND

00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:06.443 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THAT HAS

00:59:03.173 --> 00:59:07.177 region:rollup2
HAS KIND OF? BEEN DISSEMINATED

00:59:06.443 --> 00:59:08.111 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE.

00:59:07.177 --> 00:59:09.312 region:rollup2
OKAY AND THEN FOR DEPARTMENT OF

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:10.947 region:rollup2
FINANCE THIS WASN'T IN THE

00:59:09.312 --> 00:59:13.083 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATIVE BUDGET REQUEST.

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:14.151 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE REASON THAT THAT?

00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:15.318 region:rollup2
IF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SITE

00:59:14.151 --> 00:59:16.253 region:rollup2
THIS WITH.

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:18.121 region:rollup2
WHERE THE END OF INCLUSION IN

00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:21.091 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET?

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:21.691 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE THE WAY WE'VE AFTER

00:59:21.091 --> 00:59:24.327 region:rollup2
THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:24.895 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:27.464 region:rollup2
THE GOALS OF THE VISION FOR

00:59:24.895 --> 00:59:28.765 region:rollup2
SUCCESS. AND WE CONTINUE TO

00:59:27.464 --> 00:59:31.068 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT INNOVATION IS

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:33.103 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS.

00:59:31.068 --> 00:59:34.805 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS FOR INSTANCE

00:59:33.103 --> 00:59:36.073 region:rollup2
WE SEE A LOT OF INNOVATIONS THAT

00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:38.075 region:rollup2
STAR AT.

00:59:36.073 --> 00:59:39.543 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL AT THINGS LIKE

00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:41.445 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGE PROMISE PROGRAM

00:59:39.543 --> 00:59:42.446 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE MEASURES AND THEN I

00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:43.313 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD THE POTENTIAL BEING

00:59:42.446 --> 00:59:43.880 region:rollup2
SCALED.

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:46.283 region:rollup2
ACROSS.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:47.951 region:rollup2
AT THE SYSTEM AND WE OFTEN HEAR

00:59:46.283 --> 00:59:49.886 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO INNOVATE

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:51.421 region:rollup2
AND TO TEST NEW IDEAS AT THE

00:59:49.886 --> 00:59:52.722 region:rollup2
COLLEGE LEVEL SO THIS IS A

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:53.323 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER

00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:55.459 region:rollup2
STAFF FACULTY. AN OPPORTUNITY

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:57.561 region:rollup2

RECEIVE A GRANT TO IMPLEMENT

00:59:57.561 --> 01:00:00.564 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NEW SOMETHING

00:59:58.728 --> 01:00:02.099 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TO ADDRESS.

01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:03.533 region:rollup2
VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES LIKE

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.168 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WE REALLY SAW

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:07.070 region:rollup2
THIS ALIGNED.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:10.040 region:rollup2
OUT WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:12.342 region:rollup2
IN THOSE SCHOOLS AND THAT GOOD

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.843 region:rollup2
USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING.

I SEE THAT.

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:23.954 region:rollup2
THIS STAFF REPORT INDICATES

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:25.422 region:rollup2

CATEGORIES ONE THIS FUNDING FOR.

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:11.301 region:rollup2
SERVE EXISTING WORKLOAD TIGHTER

SECOND ONE IS ONLINE COLLEGE IN

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:16.005 region:rollup2
THE THIRD IS THE FUNDING FOR THE

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.340 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA AND THE CITY E.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.608 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE CITY.

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:20.143 region:rollup2
SO ON THE FIRST PIECE FOR

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:21.211 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR EXISTING ABOUT WORK

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.645 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WOULD WRECK RECOMMEND

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:24.447 region:rollup2
REJECTS AND.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:26.049 region:rollup2
WE WE DIDN'T GET A LOT OF WORK

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:27.383 region:rollup2
WITH THE TALENT THAT JUST BY THE

01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:28.985 region:rollup2
ONGOING WORK WOULD NEED.

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.619 region:rollup2
AT THE CHANCES OF US AND WE ARE

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.020 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WAS

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:32.622 region:rollup2
A REVIEW LAST SPRING AND THAT

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:33.256 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WERE SOME POSITIONS

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:35.625 region:rollup2
INCREASED.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:36.826 region:rollup2
LAST MAY WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:37.694 region:rollup2
THE TOUGHEST OPPOSITE INDICATED

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.528 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT WAYS

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:40.563 region:rollup2
THAT THEY MIGHT.

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:41.965 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURE THE THOUGH

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.899 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION TO FURTHER I'M

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:44.834 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.969 region:rollup2
BECAUSE DISTRICTS AND IF IF

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.103 region:rollup2
THERE IS A MORE DEDUCTIBLES IN

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:48.404 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE WE THINK THE

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:50.440 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER IT.

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:52.208 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE ONLINE COLLEGE

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.977 region:rollup2
WE WOULD RECOMMEND. WILL NOT

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:54.544 region:rollup2
PROVIDING ANY STATE OPERATIONS

01:06:53.977 --> 01:06:55.712 region:rollup2
FUNDING RELATED TO ONLINE

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:57.347 region:rollup2
COLLEGE.

01:06:55.712 --> 01:06:58.848 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE UP

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.450 region:rollup2
TO THOUGHTS ARE MORE THE TYPE OF

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.051 region:rollup2
ACTIVE ACTIVITIES AT A COLLEGE

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:04.587 region:rollup2
WOULD BE. UNDERTAKING THESE ARE

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:06.289 region:rollup2
NOT OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE.

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:07.390 region:rollup2
OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO IF

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:09.158 region:rollup2
THERE IS ANY NEED TO.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.660 region:rollup2
FOR THAT WORK WHEN WE THINK

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:11.227 region:rollup2
THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED WITH THE

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.828 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:13.196 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:15.265 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO THE

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:17.500 region:rollup2
COLLEGE SO IF THERE IS CHAPTERS

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:17.934 region:rollup2
OFFICE STAFF HAVE TO DO WE WOULD

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.301 region:rollup2
RECKON THERE'D BE A

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:18.902 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT.

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:21.170 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF A REIMBURSEMENT

01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:23.172 region:rollup2
MODEL I USE FOR THAT PURPOSE.

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:24.874 region:rollup2
WEIGHT WITH WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:26.109 region:rollup2
KEY TO ALL OF A.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.544 region:rollup2
THE E. PROGRAM POSITION IN THE

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:28.978 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA WE REDUCE BEHOLD

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.179 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION AND THOUGHT THAT

01:07:28.978 --> 01:07:31.047 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR THOSE POSITIONS

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:31.614 region:rollup2
WILL REALLY DEPEND.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.016 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY ON ULTIMATELY

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:35.318 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:35.885 region:rollup2
WHAT PROPOSALS YOU ADOPT

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.553 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FUNDING

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:40.089 region:rollup2
FORMULA IF YOU HAVE A VERY

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:41.357 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED MORE COMPLICATED?

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.992 region:rollup2
APPROACH YOU MIGHT BE MORE

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:45.328 region:rollup2
STUFF THAN JUST ONE UMBER

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:46.829 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVELY IF YOU ARE ARE

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:48.398 region:rollup2
ADOPTING A NEW.

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:49.432 region:rollup2
FUNNY FOR ME BUT ALSO

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:50.767 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATING CATEGORICAL

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:53.002 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN ELIMINATES MOST

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:54.470 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS YOU MIGHT. BE ABLE

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:55.738 region:rollup2
TO REDIRECT EXISTING POSITIONS

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:57.473 region:rollup2
ALL ULTIMATELY HOW MANY YOU NEED

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.974 region:rollup2
WILL DEPEND ON THE ULTIMATE

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.943 region:rollup2
POLICIES ADOPTED BY THE

01:07:57.974 --> 01:08:01.177 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE.

THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:07.917 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT REFLECTS THE GROWING

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:09.953 region:rollup2
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.087 region:rollup2
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. PART OF

01:08:09.953 --> 01:08:12.555 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE CHANGES MADE BY THE

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:13.957 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:15.291 region:rollup2
PART OF THOSE ARE CHANGES IN THE

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:16.726 region:rollup2
APPROACH BY THE BOARD OF

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.361 region:rollup2
GOVERNORS AND CHANCELLOR OAKLEY.

ALL KNOW TO FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS

01:08:18.361 --> 01:08:20.730 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGE OUR THINKING ABOUT

01:08:19.262 --> 01:08:21.965 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF THE STATE OFFICE THE

01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:23.833 region:rollup2
FIRST AS I MENTIONED IS THE

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:25.401 region:rollup2
VISION FOR SUCCESS. WE'VE TALKED

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:26.769 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ITS GOALS BUT

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.771 region:rollup2
IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTS COMMITMENTS

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:30.807 region:rollup2
THAT OUR OFFICE IS MADE. AND AND

01:08:28.771 --> 01:08:32.308 region:rollup2
ONE BIG SHIFT IS A MORE ACTIVE

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:33.509 region:rollup2
ROLE FOR OUR OFFICE NOT WITH

01:08:32.308 --> 01:08:35.678 region:rollup2
REGARD TO COMPLIANCE.

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:37.347 region:rollup2
WOULD STATE RULES AND STATE

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:38.648 region:rollup2
LAWS BUT ON LEADERSHIP

01:08:37.347 --> 01:08:39.682 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING CAPACITY BUILDING

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:41.384 region:rollup2
DIVISIONS.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:43.052 region:rollup2
SAYS IN PART THAT OUR OFFICE

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:44.721 region:rollup2

CROSS SYSTEMS.

01:08:52.261 --> 01:08:54.764 region:rollup2
THE SECOND SHIFT AGAIN IS

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.965 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'VE MENTIONED.

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:57.667 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.935 region:rollup2
OF THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK

TO MODEL HOW WE TREAT CLEAR

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:08.444 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS TO EDUCATIONAL GOALS.

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:09.679 region:rollup2
ARE ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT WE ARE

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:11.914 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO TEAR DOWN THE

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:13.716 region:rollup2
FALSE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN ACADEMIC

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:15.018 region:rollup2

AND SO THAT WORK IS ONGOING IT

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.057 region:rollup2
MAY ALTER.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:22.492 region:rollup2
HOW WE WOULD ALLOCATE THE

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:24.227 region:rollup2

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:07.563 region:rollup2
AND.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:08.431 region:rollup2
IT IT DOESN'T SEEM REALISTIC

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:10.199 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD HAVE WANTED

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:11.334 region:rollup2
MINUTES STRAIGHTER.

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:13.736 region:rollup2
FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:16.372 region:rollup2
COORDINATE THESE REGIONAL

THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.977 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:11:19.642 --> 01:11:22.278 region:rollup2
THAT DOES THE CHANCES OFFICE

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:23.713 region:rollup2
HAVE OPINION ON THAT.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:24.914 region:rollup2
ALL I CAN DEFERRED TO THE

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:27.116 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE.

01:11:24.914 --> 01:11:29.852 region:rollup2
RATIONALE I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:31.420 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THE CHANCELLOR'S

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:33.055 region:rollup2
OFFICE IS CHARGED WITH.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:34.557 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM I

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.458 region:rollup2
THINK WE WOULD. BELIEVE THAT

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:37.326 region:rollup2
THERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.895 region:rollup2
NEEDED IN ANY CASE I THINK WE

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:40.196 region:rollup2
WOULD RELY HEAVILY ON OUR PART

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.697 region:rollup2
EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS OF THE

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:43.800 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. BUT.

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:45.735 region:rollup2
BUT IF THAT IS A ROLE THAT THAT

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
YOU ALL CHARGES WITH BUT I THINK

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:48.938 region:rollup2
WE NEED.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.972 region:rollup2
WILL NEED RESOURCES TO DO THAT.

01:11:48.938 --> 01:11:51.140 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU'RE

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.441 region:rollup2
REALLY FIGHT A FIGHT HAD TO NEW

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.776 region:rollup2
ROLE THERE.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.844 region:rollup2
I THINK WE RESPECT THE FACT THAT

01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.945 region:rollup2
THESE ARE FOLKS THAT THE

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:58.147 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT EDUCATION.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:59.916 region:rollup2
WORKS WITH WORKED WITH REGULAR.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.050 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS YOU BRING UP A

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:03.319 region:rollup2
GOOD POINT MISTER MURATSUCHI

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.720 region:rollup2
THAT A FEW OF THESE ARE

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:07.089 region:rollup2
DEPENDENT ON OUR OTHER ACTIONS

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:09.659 region:rollup2
THE ONLINE.

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:11.227 region:rollup2
DEBATE WHICH. IS A BIG DEBATE AS

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:13.796 region:rollup2
YOU SAW YESTERDAY.

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:15.832 region:rollup2
AND AND THEN THE FUNDING FORMULA

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:18.034 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL GET TO AND THEN THAT

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:19.969 region:rollup2
THE CT PROPOSAL AND SO I THINK

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:22.238 region:rollup2
ALIVE THESE. ARE PREMATURE WE WE

01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:24.273 region:rollup2
WE WHAT WE ONE ACT NOW ANYWAY

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:25.474 region:rollup2
HOLD US OPEN BUT. THAT LOOKS

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:26.042 region:rollup2
LIKE ABOUT HALF OF THESE

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.878 region:rollup2
ARE PREDICATED BY WHAT WE DO

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:30.313 region:rollup2
WITH THE OTHER ITEMS.

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:30.947 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL NOTE THAT THAT THAT

01:12:30.313 --> 01:12:32.181 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE THE REASONS THAT WE

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:33.783 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.218 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF THE

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:37.019 region:rollup2
THINKING PROGRAM GOING THROUGH

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:39.255 region:rollup2
CD SO NOW. WE HAVE SOME

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:40.690 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO THAT AS WELL.

01:12:39.255 --> 01:12:42.992 region:rollup2
MISTER MARK MISTER BELL PAL. YES

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.393 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:46.195 region:rollup2
I'M THE NEW GUY ON THE

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:48.698 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES GO UP STILL TRYING TO

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:50.132 region:rollup2
CONNECT ALL THE DOTS.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:52.134 region:rollup2
THE TWELVE IT'S THE FIFTEEN

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:55.504 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THEY WERE FUNDED AT

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:56.639 region:rollup2
ONE TIME WORK THEY.

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:56.839 region:rollup2
ALL TAKE A STAB AT THE SO I

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:58.207 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:59.742 region:rollup2
.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.644 region:rollup2
YES THE ANSWER IS.

01:12:59.742 --> 01:13:04.580 region:rollup2
YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:05.982 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR CONTROL AGENCIES BUDGET

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:07.516 region:rollup2
INCLUDING OUR AGENCIES TO ISSUE

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:08.251 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED ON A DOLLAR BASIS IN

01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:09.752 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.853 region:rollup2
ALSO CONTROLLED ON A POSITION

01:13:09.752 --> 01:13:11.887 region:rollup2
BASIS

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:14.290 region:rollup2
OVER TIME.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:16.792 region:rollup2
AGENCY BUDGETS INCLUDING OURS.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:17.960 region:rollup2
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:19.262 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF POSITIONS THAT WERE

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.930 region:rollup2
FUNDED AND THE NUMBER AND WHERE

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:22.131 region:rollup2
THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT.

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:24.033 region:rollup2
BECOMES A LITTLE MORE

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:25.968 region:rollup2
DISJOINTED SO WE HAVE A POSITION

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:27.370 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A SITUATION NOW WHERE WE

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:29.538 region:rollup2
HAVE AUTHORITY TO HIRE.

01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:30.940 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL POSITIONS BUT WE

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:32.742 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FILL

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.977 region:rollup2
THOSE POSITIONS BECAUSE OF YOU

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:35.845 region:rollup2
KNOW ALONG. A SET OF INCREMENTAL

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:38.547 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH.

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:40.249 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO NUMBERS HAVE BECOME

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.284 region:rollup2
MORE DISTORTED OKAY BECAUSE.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.951 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THESE FIFTEEN

01:13:41.284 --> 01:13:44.620 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:45.554 region:rollup2
.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.890 region:rollup2
DRAWING ON PAST EXPERIENCE IN

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:49.191 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.927 region:rollup2
WE WOULD OFTEN USE VACANT

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:52.695 region:rollup2
POSITIONS TO TRANSFER THAT MONEY

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.063 region:rollup2
TO OTHER USES

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:55.431 region:rollup2
SO IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED HERE

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:57.233 region:rollup2
IT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:58.301 region:rollup2

CRITICIZING AT ALL BECAUSE IT'S

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.207 region:rollup2
A NORMAL PRACTICE IN. ANY

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:07.176 region:rollup2

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:28.350 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO DEVELOPING BETTER

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.785 region:rollup2
RESOURCE CENTERS PROVIDING

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:30.686 region:rollup2
SERVICES FOR VETERANS ON CAMPUS.

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:32.755 region:rollup2
AND THAT GROUP.

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:34.090 region:rollup2
GOT TOGETHER AND CAME UP WITH

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:35.825 region:rollup2
THIS MINIMUM SAYS STANDARDS

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.026 region:rollup2
WHICH WE RELEASED TO THE SYSTEM.

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:38.494 region:rollup2
I'M NOT ONLY DO THEY MEAN DID

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:40.329 region:rollup2
THEY COME UP WITH THE MINIMUM

01:16:38.494 --> 01:16:41.730 region:rollup2
SAYS STANDARDS THEY ALSO CAME UP

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.998 region:rollup2
OF THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR.

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.233 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTING THEIR ALLOCATING

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:45.434 region:rollup2
THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.901 region:rollup2
ONGOING FUNDS.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:48.070 region:rollup2
SO.

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:49.805 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FUNDING

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:51.907 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WERE REQUIRED TO

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:53.442 region:rollup2
COMPLETE A CERTIFICATION FORM

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:55.311 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDED THOSE MINIMUM SET

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:57.046 region:rollup2
THE STANDARDS AND IDENTIFY WHAT

01:16:55.311 --> 01:16:58.414 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THEY CURRENTLY MEET.

01:16:57.046 --> 01:16:59.715 region:rollup2
AND THE THINKING BEHIND THAT WAS

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:02.084 region:rollup2
THAT IT SHOULD THIS FUNDING

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:02.651 region:rollup2
CONTINUE WE CAN ASK THEM TO DO

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:04.920 region:rollup2
THAT FROM YOUR YEAR IN THE

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:05.888 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVE. YOU KNOW WHEN

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.257 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TO PRIOR TO.

01:17:05.888 --> 01:17:09.325 region:rollup2
ENSURE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:10.493 region:rollup2
TOWARDS MEETING THOSE STANDARDS.

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:12.561 region:rollup2
SO WITH REGARDS TO THE FUNDING

01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:14.330 region:rollup2
FORMULA IT WAS FAIRLY SIMPLE THE

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:15.798 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR WHEN I TOOK THIS

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.533 region:rollup2
POSITION OVER KNOCKED OVER THE

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.767 region:rollup2
GOAL WAS TO GET THE FUNDING OUT

01:17:17.533 --> 01:17:20.035 region:rollup2
BE THE STATE DEPARTMENT SYSTEM

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:22.738 region:rollup2
ANNEX OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WAS

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:23.472 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY. SO WE QUICKLY CAME

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:24.773 region:rollup2
UP WITH THAT OF VERY BASIC

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.674 region:rollup2
FORMULA. THE FOR

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:27.009 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT FIVE MILLION

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:28.944 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A ONE MILLION DOLLARS

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:30.880 region:rollup2
WAS DIVIDED EVENLY AMONGST EACH

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:32.581 region:rollup2
COLLEGE AT SOME IS CERTIFICATION

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:34.183 region:rollup2
FORM REQUESTING FUNDING.

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:36.952 region:rollup2
THE REMAINING FORTY FOUR MILLION

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:39.121 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WAS ALLOCATED BASED ON.

01:17:36.952 --> 01:17:40.289 region:rollup2
EACH COLLEGES PRO RATED SHARE OF

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:41.790 region:rollup2
THE TOTAL NUMBER STUDENT

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:42.992 region:rollup2
VETERANS CERTIFIED BY EVERY

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.059 region:rollup2
COLLEGE THAT SIMILAR

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:45.294 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION FORM DURING THE

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:46.729 region:rollup2
STATE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN

01:17:45.294 --> 01:17:47.897 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN.

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:49.732 region:rollup2
SO THE BASS LIKE OPPONENT WAS

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:51.667 region:rollup2
THERE TO PROTECT SMALL COLLEGES

01:17:49.732 --> 01:17:54.270 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T SERVE ARE A TON OF

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:55.738 region:rollup2
VETERANS. AND AND SOME OF THE

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:57.172 region:rollup2
RESULTS OF THAT ALLOCATION

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:58.374 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN HAVE

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.674 region:rollup2
GONE OUT THEY WENT OUT AS I SAID

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:01.477 region:rollup2
IN.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.945 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THE

01:18:01.477 --> 01:18:04.446 region:rollup2
SMALLEST ALLOCATION WAS IN ABOUT

01:18:02.945 --> 01:18:06.315 region:rollup2
TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:07.583 region:rollup2
ONE DOLLARS AND WHAT PALAVA DAY.

YEAR SEE MY SAY TEN THOUSAND

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:20.296 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF PETER

01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:21.564 region:rollup2
LAB OR RELEASED BY.

01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:22.164 region:rollup2
HERE ELEVEN ABOUT A RESOURCE.

01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:24.300 region:rollup2
THE LARGEST ALLOCATION WHAT

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:25.801 region:rollup2

VETERANS IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:30.639 region:rollup2
AND THEY RECEIVED A HUNDRED

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.941 region:rollup2
FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:34.109 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS.

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.610 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I HEALTHY ALLOCATION.

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.711 region:rollup2
WITH HER GARCIA ONE TIME

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:36.946 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:39.048 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN THE FINAL STAGES OF

01:18:36.946 --> 01:18:41.250 region:rollup2
COMPLETING THE REQUEST FOR

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:42.318 region:rollup2

END OF MARCH.

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:46.655 region:rollup2
AND HAVE MEANING GONE THROUGH

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.823 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:49.458 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS REVIEWED THE SCORE

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:52.328 region:rollup2
THE APPLICATIONS AND ANNOUNCE

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:53.729 region:rollup2
THE THE SUCCESSFUL APPLICANTS.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:55.197 region:rollup2
I BY THE END OF MAY SO THAT IS

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.532 region:rollup2
THE GOAL WITH REGARDS THE.

01:18:55.197 --> 01:19:02.004 region:rollup2
THE THE GRANT FUNDING AT THIS

01:18:56.532 --> 01:19:03.539 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:19:02.004 --> 01:19:04.873 region:rollup2
OVER ALL THE DO YOU VIEW THAT

01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:07.009 region:rollup2
THERE IS THERE IS THAT THERE'SA

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:08.477 region:rollup2
NEED OUT THERE IBC SEVENTY

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:09.912 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:11.847 region:rollup2
VETERANS AND OUR COMMUNICATIVE

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:13.983 region:rollup2
AS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND THAT

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:17.086 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT. MORE HELP AND MORE

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:18.520 region:rollup2
THE MERRIER SO. IF THERE WAS A

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:20.022 region:rollup2
DESIRE.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.324 region:rollup2
WHAT KID BUT CAN BE DONE?

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:23.892 region:rollup2
OFFICIALLY.

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:25.561 region:rollup2
IN IN THE IN THIS CONTEST FEEL.

01:19:23.892 --> 01:19:26.762 region:rollup2
I ABSOLUTELY THERE'S.

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:28.564 region:rollup2
I NEED TO ACTUALLY JUST

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:29.465 region:rollup2
RECENTLY CAN TARGET OF OUR

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:30.866 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND OUR NUMBERS OF

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:32.735 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SWORN EIGHTY SIX

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:34.370 region:rollup2
THOUSAND STE IN BETTER AND SO.

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:36.905 region:rollup2
AS YOU SEE IT'S CLIMBING.

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:37.706 region:rollup2
NINETY FIVE OR NINETY SEVEN OF

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:39.541 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEGES ACTUALLY HAVE

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:40.943 region:rollup2
BETTER RESOURCE CENTERS BUT THE

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:42.378 region:rollup2
ISSUE IS.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.379 region:rollup2
SISTERS BEEN A FUNNY PART THIS

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:45.681 region:rollup2
YEAR THE THERE WILDLY

01:19:43.379 --> 01:19:47.516 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENT IN SIZE AND IN

01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:48.884 region:rollup2
STOPPING AND SERVICES OFFERED.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:51.420 region:rollup2
SO I THINK.

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:53.122 region:rollup2
I THINK THE ONGOING FUNDING IS

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.323 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY THE MOST EFFICIENT

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:56.692 region:rollup2
VEHICLE FAR OFFICE TO GET THE

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:57.092 region:rollup2
FUNDS OUT SO IF THERE WERE

01:19:56.692 --> 01:19:58.193 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:59.928 region:rollup2
GRANT FUNDING IS IS IS ALWAYS

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.963 region:rollup2
GREAT BUT IT'S A VERY LABOR

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:03.065 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE PROCESS TO CREATE THE

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:04.867 region:rollup2
RFA AND THEN I GET THE PEOPLE

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:06.402 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO TO SCORE THOSE AND

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:07.536 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE HIM AS

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:08.671 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY OUT TO AS MANY PEOPLE

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.606 region:rollup2
SO. I THINK.

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:12.307 region:rollup2
FROM MY STANDPOINT I WOULD

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:14.043 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THE ONGOING FUNDING

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:15.010 region:rollup2
VERSUS GRANT FUNDING SO

01:20:14.043 --> 01:20:16.779 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY GETS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.547 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THE PIE I THINK THAT

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:21.583 region:rollup2
WOULD. NOT BE THE BEST BUS ROUTE

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:23.519 region:rollup2
MY OPINION NOW IS THE FOR IS WE

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:25.688 region:rollup2
AYE WE WANTED AND TOWARD A

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:29.558 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE FEW MONTHS

01:20:25.688 --> 01:20:31.827 region:rollup2
AGO WHEN UP IN ROCKLIN WHAT'S

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:36.899 region:rollup2
AGAINST TERRORISTS HERE EXACTLY.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:37.866 region:rollup2
AND WE WE WENT AND VISITED THAT

01:20:36.899 --> 01:20:38.500 region:rollup2
VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.601 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS THE FIRST THE OVER

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.836 region:rollup2
THE YEARS I TALKED ABOUT THE

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.204 region:rollup2
FACILITY THAT THEY CAN THAT THEY

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.471 region:rollup2
CREATED THERE AND THEN COURSES

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:43.439 region:rollup2
STAFFING.

01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:44.640 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THESE.

01:20:43.439 --> 01:20:45.908 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTEEN OR SO COLLEGES

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.309 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT MAYBE

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:49.044 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE IS IS IT REALLY NEED

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:50.145 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TAKE GREAT IT IS THAT

01:20:49.044 --> 01:20:50.813 region:rollup2
THEY NEED A.

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:51.880 region:rollup2
SOLELY A PORTABLE BUILDING THERE

01:20:50.813 --> 01:20:53.182 region:rollup2
OR IS IT STAFFING THAT THEY CAN

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.950 region:rollup2
HAVE A PLACE IN EXISTING.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.951 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUS WHY ETHNIC A

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:57.686 region:rollup2
REALIST IT'S ALWAYS.

01:20:55.951 --> 01:20:58.053 region:rollup2
ITO THE TOUGH PART TO GET IS A

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:58.787 region:rollup2
SPACE ON CAMPUS.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.788 region:rollup2
.

01:20:58.787 --> 01:21:01.156 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S TOUGH I YOU KNOW

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:02.424 region:rollup2
WITH NINETY SEVEN BECAUSE HAVING

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:03.692 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME LEVEL

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:05.961 region:rollup2
OF SUCCESS HEARING GAINES SPACE

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.830 region:rollup2
ON CAMPUS SO WERE WERE SHORT

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:09.431 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN COLLEGES THIS POINT IT

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:11.300 region:rollup2
WORKS IF. SEVENTEENTH THAT ARE

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:14.603 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN FIFTEEN ONLINE BUT.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:16.605 region:rollup2
SO I THINK JUST. FUNDING TO TO

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:18.574 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EXPAND THOSE SINNERS TO

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:19.875 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT AS THE GROUP REALLY.

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:21.310 region:rollup2
REVISE YOUR GROUP REALLY

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.978 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDS HAVING SEPARATE

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:24.513 region:rollup2
OFFICES WITHIN THE CENTER SO

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:26.248 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN HAVE PRIVACY FOR

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:28.317 region:rollup2
COUNSELING OR THE OR BENEFIT

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:30.252 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION. AND PROBABLY I

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:30.886 region:rollup2
WOULD GUESS MANY OF THOSE DON'T

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:33.188 region:rollup2
HAVE PRIVATE OFFICES SOME MORE

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.723 region:rollup2
ADVANCED ONES DO BUT SO YOU KNOW

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:36.558 region:rollup2
SOME. TEN PREVENT FOR LACK OF A

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:37.092 region:rollup2
BETTER TERM WOULD WOULD WOULD BE

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.193 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL BUT THEN ALSO

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:41.163 region:rollup2
STAFFING.

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:43.432 region:rollup2
GROUP RECOMMENDED ONE FULL TIME

01:21:41.163 --> 01:21:45.033 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR LATIMER STAFFORD VA

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:47.603 region:rollup2
WORK STUDY STUDENTS WHICH IS A

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:48.504 region:rollup2
GREAT PROGRAM BECAUSE WE GET

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:50.439 region:rollup2
STUDENT VETERANS PAID FOR DOING

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:53.475 region:rollup2
WORK BUT.

01:21:50.439 --> 01:21:55.210 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T HAVE A DECENT A

01:21:53.475 --> 01:22:00.749 region:rollup2
COUPLE ERA MAYBE WORKS STAY

01:21:55.210 --> 01:22:01.483 region:rollup2
STUDENT YOU NEED A DIRECTOR OF

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.251 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OVER OVER THE.

01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:02.851 region:rollup2
OKAY COULD I I WOULD JUST ADD I

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.452 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.019 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ALSO TO HAVE AS

01:22:03.452 --> 01:22:04.453 region:rollup2
PART OF THE FUNDING FORMULA

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:05.053 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IN THE

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:05.721 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION OF CATEGORICAL

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.622 region:rollup2
SPENT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:07.456 region:rollup2
THAT. WE THINK IS ESPECIALLY

01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:08.090 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU CREATE THE

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:08.991 region:rollup2
RIGHTS RIGHT INCENTIVES AROUND

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.758 region:rollup2
HOW TO SERVE THIS POPULATION OF

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:10.325 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ANOTHER POPULATION OF

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:10.626 region:rollup2
STUDENTS THAT WE THINK. YOU

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:13.695 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:14.596 region:rollup2
REQUIRE NEED ADDITIONAL

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:17.299 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:19.201 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:21.203 region:rollup2
YET SOME. I'M WEARING TWO HATS

01:22:19.201 --> 01:22:22.237 region:rollup2
ON THIS ONE BECAUSE I'M ALSO THE

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:24.239 region:rollup2
VICE CHAIR OF THE VETERANS CAN.

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:25.407 region:rollup2
SO

01:22:24.239 --> 01:22:28.410 region:rollup2
JUST IN A NUTSHELL LIKE THE

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:31.280 region:rollup2
ELEVATOR SPEECH.

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:32.781 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE VETERANS.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.982 region:rollup2
WENT INTO THE MILITARY RIGHT OUT

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:35.851 region:rollup2
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

01:22:33.982 --> 01:22:38.353 region:rollup2
SO THEIR LIFELINE LITERALLY

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:40.656 region:rollup2
THEIR LIFELINE IS THAT WHEN THEY

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:42.558 region:rollup2
GET OUT THERE FOUR YEARS MINIMUM

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:44.293 region:rollup2
BEHIND EVERYBODY ELSE

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:46.128 region:rollup2
OKAY PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING FROM

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:47.930 region:rollup2
BERKELEY. WHILE A LOT OF THESE

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:49.498 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE STARTIN TO GO TO

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.799 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:22:49.498 --> 01:22:52.434 region:rollup2
SO THERE FOUR YEARS BEHIND RIGHT

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:55.237 region:rollup2
OUT THE GATE.

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:55.771 region:rollup2
AND THEY NEED TO GET A JOB. AND

01:22:55.237 --> 01:22:57.773 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO GET IN THE

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:59.908 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THAT'S THE

01:22:57.773 --> 01:23:02.144 region:rollup2
MAIN THING.

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:04.146 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A VETERAN SUICIDE RATE

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:05.781 region:rollup2
OF TWENTY TWO. PER DAY IN THE

01:23:04.146 --> 01:23:07.783 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES

01:23:05.781 --> 01:23:08.917 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW REALLY WHAT IT IS IN

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:11.553 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:13.255 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:15.357 region:rollup2
BUT ONCE YOU GET THE VETERANS ON

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:17.159 region:rollup2
TRACK.

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.660 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY AND YOU YOU WOULD

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:21.029 region:rollup2
HAVE THE NUMBERS MORE THAN I

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:23.031 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:23:21.029 --> 01:23:24.766 region:rollup2
THEY TEND TO STICK WITH. MANY OF

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:27.202 region:rollup2
THEM ARE MARRIED AND THEIR

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:28.804 region:rollup2
SPOUSES SENATE IN THE SCHOOL AND

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:30.239 region:rollup2
WORK THEY'RE NOT.

01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:32.207 region:rollup2
GOOF OFF

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:33.542 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.911 region:rollup2
.

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:38.580 region:rollup2
AND.

01:23:35.911 --> 01:23:40.215 region:rollup2
THE FLAT RATES I THINK ARE VERY

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.217 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF

01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:44.853 region:rollup2
THE VETERANS CENTERS THEY'RE NOT

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:46.188 region:rollup2
JUST TO ASSIST VETERANS IN THEIR

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.991 region:rollup2
SCHOOLING.

01:23:46.188 --> 01:23:49.358 region:rollup2
OF MANY OF THEM HAVE PTSD MANY

01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:51.159 region:rollup2
OF.

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:53.729 region:rollup2
ARE CAUGHT IN A TRAP LIKE

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:54.997 region:rollup2
LITTLE RATS IN THE VA SYSTEM.

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:56.532 region:rollup2
AND THEY GET TOGETHER AND

01:23:54.997 --> 01:23:59.735 region:rollup2
COMPARE NOTES AND THEY GET

01:23:56.532 --> 01:24:01.103 region:rollup2
EDUCATED IN ALL HOW TO ACCESS

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:02.504 region:rollup2
ALL THEIR BENEFITS.

01:24:01.103 --> 01:24:04.339 region:rollup2
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN INSTEAD OF

01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:06.508 region:rollup2
BEING TRAPPED LIKE A RAT.

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:07.943 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER AND

01:24:06.508 --> 01:24:09.745 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETTING SOME OF THEIR

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:11.547 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND GETTING SOME OF

01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:13.148 region:rollup2
THEIR APPEALS TAKING CARE OF. SO

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:16.318 region:rollup2
THESE VETERAN SENATORS

01:24:13.148 --> 01:24:18.186 region:rollup2
ARE OFTEN FOR PEOPLE OF A LIFE

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:20.222 region:rollup2
RING IT'S A LIFE RAFT FOR.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:22.658 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:24.459 region:rollup2
JUST MY OPINION OBSERVATION I

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:25.027 region:rollup2
THINK THE TRACK WERE ON IS VERY

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:27.229 region:rollup2
GOOD.

01:24:25.027 --> 01:24:30.065 region:rollup2
.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:34.002 region:rollup2
IF WE STAY AT THE FLAT RATES

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:36.471 region:rollup2
THAT WAY. EACH COLLEGE EACH

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:38.240 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAN A.

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:40.976 region:rollup2
TAILOR THEIR PROGRAM.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.644 region:rollup2
TO THE VETERAN COMMUNITY BECAUSE

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:44.880 region:rollup2
IN SAN DIEGO YOU HAVE NAVY

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:47.416 region:rollup2

01:24:53.755 --> 01:25:00.295 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IN THAT AREA AND ALSO

01:24:57.225 --> 01:25:02.431 region:rollup2
THEY CHANGE EVEN IF IT'S SO.

01:25:00.295 --> 01:25:03.732 region:rollup2

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:05.067 region:rollup2
BE DIFFERENT IN THE DIFFERENT

AREAS.

01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:07.703 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF HUMAN

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:10.138 region:rollup2
BEINGS
