CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRIS COKE AND I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND WITH ME I HAVE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. CAPITA STOUT FIRMAR FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ACTIONS ON OUR EARLIER PROPOSALS AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ON TWO CRITICAL PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE IN SUPPORT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED DEVASTATING DISASTERS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THESE REQUEST WILL PROVIDE THE MUCH NEEDED FUNDING AND RESOURCES TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS BEFORE DURING AND AFTER DISASTERS. SINCE TWENTY TWELVE CALIFORNIA HAS RECEIVED FOURTEEN FEDERAL MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS AND DOZENS OF OTHERS STATE ONLY PROCLAMATIONS. FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALENDAR YEAR ALONE FOR THE LARGEST DEADLY ESTAMOS DAMAGING FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. I MEAN OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LIVES TO STORING ALMOST. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STRUCTURES. AND BURNING OVER ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ACRES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE BECAUSE AS PROPOSALS ARE CRITICAL TO HELP ADDRESS THOSE GAPS. OUR SYSTEM DIRECTOR TYPE OF THE STYLE WILL PROVIDE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THOSE TWO PROPOSALS AND THEN WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. SO THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS OUR DISASTER PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PROPOSAL IT'S REQUESTING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND A FEDERAL TRUST FUND AND NINETY FOUR POSITIONS TO SUPPORT. RUN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO DISASTER PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AND THREE SEPARATE PROMS. THE FIRST PRONG IS TO ADDRESS OUR STUDY STATE WORK. THIS HAS TWO COMPONENTS WE HAVE A CONVERSION OF THIRTY SIX POSITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED TERM THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED ARE ADDRESSED SEEN ONGOING WORKLOAD THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONVERT TO PERMANENT. THE SECOND PORTION OF THE PROPOSAL IS FORTY NEW POSITIONS TO ADDRESS WORKLOAD THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAVE. BUT THESE WOULD ADDRESS GAPS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED DURING THE RECENT DISASTER RESPONSE RECOVERY EFFORTS. THE SECOND PRONG OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT MISSION TASKING FUN THIS INCLUDES A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO STATE AGENCIES THAT THAT MISSION TASK BY CALLAWAY YES TO PERFORM RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS -- FOR DECLARE DISASTERS. THE POSITIONS ARE REQUIRED TO HELP TRACK THE MISSION THE MISSION TASKING ASSIGNMENTS AND ELIGIBLE COSTS. SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. FULL COST RECOVERY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE THIRD COMPONENT OF THIS IS OUR CONTINUITY AND SEARCH CAPACITY WE'RE REQUESTING SIX POSITIONS TO HELP DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE DISASTER RESERVE CORPS RESOURCE POOL. THIS WOULD DEVELOP A POOL OF POTENTIAL. STATE EMPLOYEES THAT WE COULD CALL UPON DURING TIMES OF DISASTERS IT WOULDN'T JUST BE CALLAWAY YES IT WOULD BE A STATE WIDE RESOURCE THAT COULD BE USED. WITHIN MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS AND WOULD HELP TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES AS WE NEED THEM RATHER THAN. CONTINUOUSLY GOING OUT ASKING FOR TEN HELD POSITIONS OR GETTING OUR REYES AND IT WOULD HAVE A COMPONENT THAT WOULD BE TRACKING THEIR TRAINING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. AND THEY'RE PREPARED AND READY TO RESPOND TO HELP US RESPOND TO THE DISASTERS. AND WHEN WE SEARCH. IT WOULD PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS THAT SURGE DURING THE DISASTER. AND SO IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. I DO THE WELL FIRST IN THE IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. POINTS OUT THAT. THE PERMANENT POSITIONS BEING REQUESTED FOR THE DISASTER RESERVE CORPS. COULD POTENTIALLY BE FULFILLED BY THIS MISSION -- TASKING -- TWENTY MILLION THAT'S BEING REQUESTED. AND IS SO IT'S UNCLEAR REALLY THE DIFFERENCE AND ESPECIALLY. THE THE THERE'S LITTLE LANGUAGE AT LEAST IN THE ITEM REGARDING THE TWENTY MILLION FOR THE MISSION TASKINGS SO I GUESS I'D LIKE TO KNOW -- MORE SPECIFICALLY. FOR WHAT PURPOSES THAT TWENTY MILLION WOULD BE USED. SURE SO -- SO THE TWENTY MILLION MILLION WOULD BE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN WEIGH IN A LITTLE MORE ON THIS WOULD BE -- TO INSURE THAT THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE STATE AGENCIES WHO FORWARD RESPOND TO THOSE MISSION ASSIGNMENTS. SO AND HE STAFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRACKING OF THAT ACTIVITY NOT JUST -- FOR YES BUT FOR EVERY STATE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT THEIR DOCUMENTATION IS COMPLETE ACCURATE AND SUBMITTED TIMELY SO THAT WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING THAT. THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS COMING BACK INTO KEPT CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S A PART OF THE OUT REACH THERE'S A PART OF TRACKING ACCOUNTABILITY DOCUMENTATION SO THE MIDDLE TRACKING AND THEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO RECONCILE THOSE FUNDS. THE SIX POSITIONS ON THE SURGE CAPACITY OR DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WE WOULD -- PLAN TO UTILIZE TO ESTABLISH THIS CADRE OF A POTENTIAL APPLICANTS AND EMPLOYEES THAT COULD BE BROUGHT ON FOR A DISASTER NOT JUST FOR CALLAWAY YES BUT FOR CAL FIRE FOR CAL RECYCLE FOR ANY. ONE OF THE MANY STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE RELY UPON TO PERFORM THEIR MISSION TO EITHER BACK FILL THERE'S MISSION CRITICAL STEADY STATE WORK -- SO THERE'S A THERE'S AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR CAPABILITIES EDUCATION -- THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK AND TRAVEL AND THEN BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT AND ONE TABLET THE MENTIONED THE ASPECT OF THE TRAINING THAT IS ONE PIECE THAT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH THOSE POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. THAT THERE WE HAVE TRAINING AVAILABLE TO THEM ONLINE WE HVE WEBINARS WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAINTAINING CONTACT SO WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENS WHEN THE NEXT FIRE SIEGE HAPPENS. THAT WERE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY UP CALL THOSE FOLKS BRING THEM IN AND BE ABLE TO PLACE THEM WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH AND LOSE TIME DURING THOSE CRITICAL DAYS AND WEEKS OF THE EVENT. WELL I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE STATE. OF OUR IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY TRACK THE EXPENDITURE SO THAT WE CAN SUBMIT THEM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS OUR RIGHT TO DO AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE BUT THERE JUST SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF OVERLAP. BETWEEN THE TWENTY MILLION TRACKING MISSION AND THIS -- OTHER PERMANENT POSITIONS REGARDING THE RESERVE CORPS SO THAT THAT'S MY ISSUE BUT LET ME SEE IF MY COLLEAGUES SEVENTY QUESTIONS AND WE CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT FINANCE -- RESPOND IN ADDITION TO THE STAFF PRESENTE CENTER MOORLACH THANK YOU MANAGER -- WAS IT HOGAN. COKE COKE I'M SORRY I HEARD THIRTY YEARS FROM -- WE'RE AT THE END OF THE PROCESS SO I DON'T HAVE AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHART -- FOR YES I DON'T HAVE. A BUSINESS PLAN I DON'T HAVE A STAFFING REQUEST -- SOME I MEAN I'M JUST GOING ON FAITH HERE -- SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS WAS DETERMINED -- I WANNA MAKE SURE THEY THEY'RE WORKING. SORRY -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO KNOW HOW HOW WE CAN INTERFACE. THIS YEAR HAVE THE JOY OF ALSO BEING ON ENERGY. UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS AND MEETING WITH THE CEOS OF OUR INDEPENDENT -- IN THE BILLION ON THE UTILITIES -- THEY ARE WORKING REALLY HARD ON IT'S A YOU KNOW PUTTING CAMERAS AROUND THEIR TERRITORY PUTTING UP. WIND -- DETECTION DEVICES -- THERE'S JUST SO MUCH THAT THEY'RE DOING. AT LEAST IN MY PART OF THE STATE -- SO I'M JUST WONDERING ARE WE I CANNOT MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WERE HIRING JUST ENOUGH. THAT WE CAN WORK WITH WHAT'S BEING DONE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO THAT WE COVER AT LEAST THE WILDFIRE ASPECT THAT AND FOCUSED ON RIGHT NOW. JUST JUST HELP ME OUT SURE IS SO -- pCORRECTLY -- AS FAR AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE METRICS OF THIS PERMANENT -- FULL TIME STAFF THAT WERE REQUESTING AS FAR AS THE WORKLOAD THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO AND HOW WERE -- ENVISIONING THAT WORK PLAN PLAYING OUT OF ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR DIRECTOR. IS THAT THERE ARE METRICS IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN FACT EVALUATING HOW EFFECTIVE OUR RESPONSES AND ARE TRACKING -- IT IS AS FAR AS WHAT WE'RE BEING ABLE -- TO REIMBURSE GET REIMBURSED BACK FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHAT -- YOU KNOW DECREASE OF ANY KIND OF DISALLOWANCE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT HAVE ON THE ACCURACY OF OF OUR RESPONSE. OF THE UTILITIES ARE -- VERY WELL RESOURCE IN ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR GAPS AND RECORDING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM ON MULTIPLE FRIENDS FOR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY AND AND THE CRITICAL. THIS ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN BEFORE AN EVENT TO MAKE SURE COMMUNITIES ARE READY SO AS FAR AS METRICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH HAVING A VERY DETAILED PLAN KIND OF BUILDING ON INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SUCH AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE CORPS WHICH HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR YEARS AND HOW THEY IMPLEMENTED THAT AND HOW THE TRACKS EXCESS -- AS AS WELL AS OTHER MODELS AS FAR AS CREDENTIALING PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE TO EVALUATE THE READINESS OF INDIVIDUALS. TO RESPOND AND BE PREPARED WE DON'T WANT TO PUT ANYONE IN A SITUATION AND AS YOU WELL KNOW OR CAN IMAGINE -- PUTTING SOMEONE IN AN ONBOARDING THEM DURING A DISASTER IS VERY STRESSFUL SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DO AS MUCH ADVANCED OUT REGION TRAINING AS POSSIBLE. ON THE SURGE CAPACITY SIDE AS FAR AS THE THE POSITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE COORDINATION WITH THAT REIMBURSEMENT IS HANDLED THROUGH A LOT OF ACCOUNTING A LOT OF ASSESSMENTS A LOT OF OUT REACH A LOT OF DEPARTMENT EDUCATION. TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THEIR STAFF NOT JUST TO RESPOND HERS ARE BEING ABLE TO ORGANIZE THOSE FINANCIAL PACKAGES ACCURATELY AND WE KNOW THEY KNOW IN ADVANCE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S LOOKING FOR SO THAT WE CAN GET THOSE -- THAT FUNDING BACK. AND I'M SURE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE CAN EXPAND. THANK YOU THANK YOU AFTER -- ENDED UP A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FIRST WE JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS PART OF THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S GREATER -- MAY REVISIONS ASTOR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY PROPOSAL -- YOUR QUESTION ON THE STAFFING BEING ABLE TO DO BOTH -- COMMISSION TASKING FUND AND ALSO THE SEARCH CAPACITY NEED -- JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE THE NEED FOR DEDICATED STAFFING VERSES DESIGNATED STAFFING IN ADDITION -- AS MISS COOK MENTIONED -- IS A REALLY DIFFERENT STAFFING CLASSIFICATIONS ACCOUNTING -- VERSES -- PERSONNEL HER MORE DISASTER FOCUSED -- IN THE SEARCH CAPACITY COMPONENTS REALLY NEEDED -- WHEN THE BASELINE STAFFING ISN'T THERE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF STAFFING -- AND IT'S REALLY -- A NIMBLE -- INNOVATIVE. IDEA THAT THE THE STATE'S KIND OF TAKING FROM FEMA SO -- JUST. OUT HOW I LEAVE IT AT THAT -- WELL WE WE WERE ALWAYS IN THIS KIND OF DIFFICULTY WITH -- WHEN NOT NECESSARILY BLAMING THE ADMINISTRATION BUT OUR? OUR CALENDAR STRUCTURE IS SUCH THAT. WE GET THE MAY REVISE AND HEY THAT'S TOTALLY LEGITIMATE FOR THE BUDGET FROM JANUARY TO THE BUDGET -- LATER TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE REVISIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS BUT THEN WE'RE GIVEN IT. AND DUE TO OUR CONSTITUTIONAL DEADLINE ADDITIONALLY WITH THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE -- WE NEED TO ACT PERHAPS BEFORE WE CAN -- YEAH AT LEAST AS A SUBCOMMITTEE CLOSE BEFORE WE'VE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO DRILL DOWN. TO FULLY -- TO FEEL FULLY SATISFIED THAT THE WHAT'S BEING RECOMMENDED AT IS -- YOU KNOW IS. IT IS AN OVERLAPPING SO -- I BELIEVE FIVE FOLLOWED -- IF I SAW LAST NIGHT THE ACTIONS BY THE ASSEMBLY THAT IF WE TAKE THE STAF RECOMMENDATION THAT'S HERE WHICH I SUPPORT. THIS WILL GO TO CONFERENCE AND THAT WAY IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WILL -- HELP -- WILL ELIMINATE IT FURTHER. WE CAN -- HALF THAT -- HAVE THAT DISCUSSION THERE YES REVENGE YOUR STEVENS WITH BERMAN A FINANCE -- THE ASSEMBLY YESTERDAY LEFT THE ISSUE OPEN SO I'M I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE WHAT ACTION THEY'LL BE TAKING YET OKAY THAT IS IT DEFINITELY BUT AT LEAST. AT THE MOMENTWITH WHAT THEY'VE DONE SO FAR AND IF WE ACT HE WOULD GO TO CONFERENCE -- ALRIGHT LET'S. SEE IF THERE'S PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THE SIDE OF ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ALL RIGHT -- I WOULD LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION AND AGAIN HI -- MY STAFF AGENDA HAS THAT CORRECTION OF THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ON PAGE NINE YOU HAVE IT AS PAGE EIGHT SO APOLOGIES BUT IT IS AGAIN. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO PROVE. SIX POINT SIX OH FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND FEDERAL FIND EIGHTY EIGHT POSITIONS IN THE ONE TIME TWENTY MILLION GENERAL FUND. FOR THE MATCHING MISSION TASKING ACTIVITIES AND TO REJECT THE SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND GENERAL FUND AND SIX POSITIONS FOR THE DISASTER RESERVE CORPS. OKAY WE'VE GOT A MOTION -- BROKE OFF AND SKINNER BY SENATOR MORE NOT. SENATOR BO. RIGHT. NOW WE WILL GO TO ISSUE SEVEN THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN RESILIENCY. AND I AM ASSUMING YOU ALL WILL BE PRESENTING ON THAT ALSO OKAY GREAT LET'S GO AHEAD. SO WE'RE REQUESTING FOR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN TO IMPROVE RESILIENCY AT THE STATE'S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN RESPONSE TO INVESTOR OWNED. UTILITY LED PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN ACTIONS AND TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES. AS SPECIFIC URGENT NEEDS ARE IDENTIFIED. THE INVESTOR OWNED. UTILITIES HAVE SIGNALED THEIR INTENT TO INCREASE THE USE OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT DOWN. ON THEIR ENERGIZED POWER LINES TO PREVENT WILDFIRES DURING HIGH WIND OR OTHER SEVERE EVENTS. WHICH COULD RESULT IN SEVERE CASCADING CONSEQUENCES DUE TO PROLONGED POWER OUTAGES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMUTE COMMISSION AND THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO COORDINATE PUBLIC EDUCATION INFORMATION AND COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES. TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND RESILIENCY IN RESPONSE TO THESE ACTIVITIES. THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED IN A pGOVERNMENT PLANNING GRANTS WHERE WE WOULD PROVIDE OF LEVEL OF FUNDING TO COUNTIES AND THE SEVERE. FIRE THREAT AREAS TO UPDATE THE ARM THEIR LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUTDOWNS. THEY COULD ALSO CONVENE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS AND CONDUCT TRAININGS AND EXERCISES TO REINFORCE PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL AS EXPLORE WITH THE UTILITIES THE ESTABLISHMENT OR EXPANSION. OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY LED COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER PROGRAMS. ANOTHER AREA THAT THEY COULD DO THAT THIS MONEY WOULD BE USED FOR IS TOO HARD AND STATE OWNED CRITICAL FACILITIES TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS. OVER OVER THE PROLONGED POWER OUTAGES -- WE RECENTLY SURVEYED VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES TO COME UP WITH WHAT THEIR NEEDS COULD BE. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT NOT JUST IMMEDIATE -- PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONSE AGENCIES BUT AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR THE FISH AND A HALF BATHS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE. SO THE VERY STATE AGENCIES WHO DON'T HAVE THAT BACKUP POWER NEEDED. TO MAINTAIN SERVICES DURING ANY TYPE OF SHUTDOWNS ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE HAD IS THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS IDENTIFIED TWO TITLE ONE FOOD DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES. THAT DON'T HAVE POWER BACK UP THOSE AREAS IT COULD LEAD -- TO A LOT OF FOOD GOING BAD AND THE NEED TO REPLACE THAT BERMAN. ON THIS ONE YOU AS YOU DESCRIBED IN THE STAFF REPORT SHOWS YOU'VE MENTIONED [inaudible] WELL FIRST. IT'S LEGITIMATE FOR GIVEN WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR WITH THE FIRES AND KNOWING THAT THERE IS BEEN SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH OUR POWER LINES. THAT IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY TWO AT TIMES THE POWER. BAND -- IT SO THAT'S YOUR BIG KNOWLEDGE IN NOW AND THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS ITEM BUT I NOTE THAT YOU INDICATE THAT. THIS FUNDING IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO SHORE UP THE CAPACITY FOR A STATE OFFICER AN OFF AND CAL FIRE -- TO HAVE POWER IF SUCH AN OUTAGE OCCURS YOU MENTION VARIOUS OTHER THINGS LIKE THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT STAFF PLANNING GRANTS TO IMPROVE THEIR LOCAL PREPAREDNESS WHICH MAY. REQUIRE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO IDENTIFY WHAT CRITICAL. SERVICES THEY MAY BE OPERATING THAT DON'T HAVE BACKUP POWER -- AND BE ABLE -- TO ADDRESS THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. YOU MY SALE THAT. BECAUSE IT'S ALL LISTED HERE BUT THEN I NOTED YESTERDAY IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE WHEN ASKED THE QUESTION. THE ANSWER WAS THAT SEVENTY MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS BACKUP GENERATORS FOR STATE FACILITIES. AND ONLY FIVE MILLION FOR LOCAL PLANTS. AND THAT SEEMED A BIT SKEWED TO ME WHILE I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STATE FACILITIES HAVE BACKUP. WE ALSO KNOW I MEAN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE MENTION HERE. THE ISSUE ABOUT LIFE SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO OPERATE ON THERE OBVIOUSLY IN PLACES OTHER THAN OUR FIRE STATIONS. SO IT JUST SEEMED A LITTLE SKEWED [inaudible] RESPONSE. A SERVICE TO THE ANSWER THERE SO OUR PLANNING ASSUMPTION ON THE LOCAL PLANNING GRANTS. OF IN IS BUILDING OFF OF THE LOCAL PLANNING CUT CONTINUE ON THAT THEY HAVE FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE. SO THE GOAL OF THIS FUNDING WAS TO PROVIDE. GRANTS SO THAT THEY COULD REVISIT THOSE EMERGENCY PLANS IN THE LIGHT OF THESE EXTENDED PROLONGED OUTAGES AND BE ABLE TO CONVENE A MULTI. THE FACETED STAKEHOLDER GROUPS INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS -- VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND ENSURING THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH LOCALLY WITH THEIR NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THEIR COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER APPRECIATE THAT. AND I THINK IT'S OBVIOUSLY JUST SPOKE TO THAT NEED RIGHT WHEN I'M RACING IS THAT I HAVE A B. C. P. THAT HAS A LOT OF DETAIL. OF A LOT OF NEEDS BUT THEN IN THE ANSWER ATTY ASSEMBLY. BY WAS. HEARD. AND SAW THE THE ANSWER WAS SEVENTY MILLION WOULD GO TO THE STATE FACILITIES AND ONLY FIVE MILLION FOR THESE LOCAL NATURE DESCRIBING SO IS THAT YOUR INTENTION. A THAT WAS A PLANNING ASSUMPTION THAT WENT INTO THE PART OF IT IS SORT OF A WHY ALL THE LANGUAGE AROUND ALL THESE OTHER NEEDS WHEN IN FACT REALLY THE MAJORITY DID NOT I MEAN THE MAJORITY I MEAN THAT. FINDING IS GOING TO GO FORWARD THE STATE AGENCY I JUST THINK IT'S A MORE ACCURATE DEPICTION OF WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE. WELL SO AS I MENTIONED BUILDING ON WHAT THE LOCALS ARE ALREADY-DOING IN REGARD TO THEIR LOCAL PLANNING THIS WAS A WAY TO HAVE THEM ASSESS THAT AND BE ABLE TO TRAIN AND EXERCISE AND I GUESS VALIDATE THOSE PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS FOR THESE PROLONGED OUTAGES. AND THEN KNOWING THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ON HOME THOSE LOCAL DEPEND -- FOR SUSTAINABLE SERVICES -- ARE READY TO ALSO ADDRESS THEIR FIRST RESPONDER CAPABILITIES THERE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT THE LOCALS SO -- KNOWING THAT SOME OF THE CRITICAL THAT INFRASTRUCTURE TO HARD IN THOSE FACILITIES WILL COST MORE THAN AND THEN AND THEN PERHAPS FROM THOSE PLANNING FROM THAT. THOSE LOCAL EFFORTS SEEING WHAT COMES OUT OF THOSE -- THOSE REGIONAL EFFORTS TRAINING AND EXERCISES FAR AS WHAT'S NEEDED -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS CENTER MOORLACH I THINK I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH WHAT YOU'RE. ASKING STE MADAM CHAIR THAT IS -- THIS MONEY THAT GOES TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IS THAT A GRANT IS IT ALONE YEAH. SO WHAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE A MODEL THAT WE USE UNDER OUR VICTIM SERVICES SIDE WHERE WAS A PLANNING GRANT. THAT WENT TO THE LOCA GOVERNMENT TO CONVENE A MULTI AGENCY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT REALLY -- DOVE INTO A PARTICULAR IN THE SPIN THAT CASE IT WAS OF A ON REPRESENTED GROUPS AND VICTIM A SERVICES IN THIS CASE IT WOULD BE A SIMILAR MODEL WHERE THESE PLANNING GRANTS. BASED UPON REIMBURSEMENT AND AND AT WHAT THEY USE WHETHER WAS TRAINING EXERCISE PLANNING -- WORKSHOPS THOSE LOCAL EVENTS OF THEIR OF THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD HAVE THAT CRITERIA AND THEN IT-WOULD GO TO THE LOCALS AND THEN THEY WOULD REPORT BACK AND BE ABLE TO USE THOSE MONEY. AND THEM AND THE MONEY WOULD BE PROVIDED. SO THEY CAN SCORE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY YES -- JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT. TYPICALLY WE WOULD PROVIDE MORE BACK UP -- THIS IS. A KIND OF A NEW AREA THAT WE'RE IN WITH THE PUBLIC -- CITY POWER SHUT OFFS -- THE LANGUAGE. IN THE BUDGET ACT. SIMILAR TO THE SUB COMMITTEE -- DOES PROVIDE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY -- WE ALSO. THE AGENDA NOTES THAT VISUAL LANGUAGE LANGUAGE WILL BE ADDED TO REPORT BACK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- SO. WELL THERE ISN'T MUCH QUIRK CLARITY RIGHT NOW IN MUCH DETAIL -- WORK REALLY AND EXTRAORDINARY TIMES WITH -- THESE IDEAS ABOUT US YES WE ARE TIED TO IT. I THINK A REALLY RAISING IS THAT I HAVEN'T I HVE MATERIAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT PURPOSES. FOR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ASK BUT WHEN DRILL DOWN WE FIND THAT. SEVENTY MILLION OF IT GOES TO ONE OF THE DESCRIBED THIS IS AN ONLY FIVE MILLION TO A WHOLE NUMBER OF OTHER DESCRIBED PURPOSES SO THAT IS REALLY THE ISSUE FOR ME. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT. IT. THAT THE STATE DOESN'T NEED THE SEVENTY MILLION FOR OUR STATE FACILITIES IT'S MORE THAT. HOW DO I EVALUATE WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE IN MIND WHEN I'M BEING GIVEN A LOT OF RATIONALE FOR AN EXPENDITURE BUT THEN I FIND OUT THAT REALLY THAT RATIONAL ONLY APPLIES? TO THIS MUCH OF THE EXPENDITURE AND THE OTHER RATIONALE. APPLIES TO THAT MUCH. GO AHEAD MADAM CHAIR I JUST LIKE IT MAYBE CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT FURTHER WE WE SPOKE WITH THE DIRECTIONAL AFTER AT THE ASSEMBLY HEARING AND WE'VE HAD ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AT WITHIN THE MINISTRATION I JUST WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT. WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IS KIND OF INFORMATION GATHERING AND THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FIGURE IS KIND OF A AN ATTEMPTED ASSESSING. WHAT THE NEEDS ARE CROSSED PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE EIGHT WITHIN THE STATE SO THAT THE I DON'T I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT A POINT HOLDEN NOT PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE UP AND DOWN THE STATE? STATE. FACILITIES YES STATE STATE INSTITUTIONS STATE FACILITIES. WHERE THERE ARE GAPS IN NEEDS THERE? I DON'T THINK WE'RE AT A POINT NOW WE'RE SAYING THAT OF THE SEVENTY FIVE WE'RE GOING TO SPEND SEVENTY OF IT ON THAT. I THINK WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DOING IS IDENTIFYING WHERE ALL THE GAPS IN NEEDS ARE AND THE INITIAL GRANTS THAT GO TO THE COUNTIES WE'LL BE TOGETHER SIMILAR INFORMATION FROM THEIR SIDE. THE IDEA WITH THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IS TO HAVE A FLEXIBLE PART OF MONEY SO THAT. AS THESE EVENTS START HAPPENING AND WE KNOW WHICH REGIONS ARE GOING TO BE HIT THE HEAVIEST AND WHAT -- GAPS ARE KIND OF THE MOST VULNERABLE THAT WE CAN INVEST IN IN THOSE GAPS. AND THAT WILL BE A MIX I THINK OF BOTH STATE AND LOCAL OF PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE I JUST I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING OFF OF EARLY INFORMATION YAK IS IS WE MENTIONED THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF SOMEWHAT NEW AND EVOLVING AND WE'RE TRYING TO GATHER RELEVANT. INFORMATION SO WE KNOW THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR OWN ABILITIES -- AND I THINK THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS TESTIFIED TO IN THE ASSEMBLY IS TO SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED FOR STATE INSTITUTION. GAPS RIGHT NOW AND WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO SOME GRANTS FOR INITIAL STUDIES IN ASSESSMENTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL. THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW. I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAY DEFINITIVELY THE SPLIT IS GOING TO BE SEVENTY AND FIVE I THINK ONCE WE GATHER MORE INFORMATION TO SOME OF THE GRANT TO GET SOME MORE INFORMATION. ON THESE EVENTS ACTUALLY START HAPPENING WE CAN BE MORE TARGETED. THAN HOLD KNOW A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT HOW IT GETS USED I WAS JUST KIND OF THE NAY. SKEWS ME THE NATURE OF OUR EARLY THIS IS AN IN OFFICE WE NEED A LOT MORE INFORMATION I THINK TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ALL OF THAT -- BEFORE THE BUDGETS ENACTED. THERE ARE MORE LOOK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND BRINGS UP A POINT THAT I MAYBE WHEN I JUST. ADDRESS NOW. IN THAT IS. A LACK OF INFORMATION OR VAGUENESS ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS IN TODAY'S AGENDA -- SO YOU MIGHT FIND ME VOTING NO JUST BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE IT ALL AND I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION I WANT TO THANK MATT OSTERLEY MY CONSULTANT FOR EMAIL AND YOU HAVE TO ONE AM. I'M SURE YOU GUYS WERE UP ALL NIGHT. TOO SO IT GETS WILL DIFFICULT WHEN IT JUST KIND OF COMES FREE MATCH AT THE LAST MINUTE SO. I'M NOT TRYING TO BE OBSTINATE JUST KIND OF FEELING LIKE. HOW DO YOU MAKE AN INTELLIGENT DECISION WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE? EVERYTHING THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. POINT. HI I'M PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF A NEW CAR WENT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BUT WITH THE CHAIR INDIO ASK -- IN WOULD -- WOULD ONE EMPHASIZED THAT YOU KNOW AS IS VALUATIONS ARE POTENTIALLY GOING ON THAT -- THE MONEY IN THIS PA WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO COUNTY GOVERNMENTS TO DO PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND ALSO -- TO INCREASE RECENTLY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH PRETTY pDEFINITELY ENCOURAGE THAT -- MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. EARLIER DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT. EASY I'M. HUNGRY IN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IN CONCERT DEFINITELY MAKES SENSE -- CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS RELATED TO POWER SHUT OFFS -- HOWEVER WE BROUGHT UP I'D JUST SOME KIND SOME GENERAL -- COMMENTS ABOUT THE LACK OF CLARITY ON THE THE SPECIFIC USES OF THE FUNDS AND ALSO HOW ARE WE AS WE COORDINATE WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES WHO MIGHT BE DOING. SOME ACTIVITIES ALSO AROUND POWER SHUT OFF AND SO WE'D SAID THAT -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO PURSUE THIS -- APPROACH IN THIS GENERAL CONCEPT -- A FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COULD THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER -- ONE OF THOSE IS BUDGET BILLING WHICH THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS ARE FOR EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE TO GO TO LOCALS VERSES -- THE STATE THAT COULD BE PROVIDED AS PART OF THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT YOU APPROVED -- YOU COULD PROVIDE THAT PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A MORE LIMITED DURATION JUST NINETEEN TWENTY FOR EXAMPLE WITH SOME REPORTING BACK ON THEN YOU'D HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THAT MONEY IS -- EXPECTED TO GO OUT AND AND IS ACTUALLY GOING OUT BEFORE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- OR YOU COULD MAKE THE FUNDING -- AVAILABLE PROVISIONALLY BASED ON THE SUBMISSION OF A MORE DETAILED REPORTS OF THOSE ARE A FEW OPTIONS THAT WE LAY OUT -- NOT NECESSARILY MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BUT WE DO THINK IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PURPOSE IT'S JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS -- OVERSIGHT AND THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. YES I AM A I AM SOMEWHAT STRUGGLING WITH THE THE MOTION I WOULD LIKE -- TO BECAUSE THIS. FIVE I TOTALLY SEE THE NEED. AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE DON'T FULLY HAVE THE INFO YET AND THE PART OF ACTING ON THIS IS IT WILL ALLOW -- YES TO GET SOME OF THE INFO IT'S JUST HARD TO SAY YES TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WITHOUT REALLY HAVING UNDERSTANDING YET OF HOW I MEAN THERE COULD BE THAT. POTENTIALLY THAT OUR OWN STATE OFFICES NEED MORE THAN THAT FOR THIS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH -- BACKUP POWER OR MAYBE A LOT LESS -- YOU KNOW DON'T KNOW -- SO RIGHT NOW THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE PLACE HOLDER BUDGET APPROVING WITH PLACE HOLDER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. REPORTING USES OF THE FUNDING -- THAT WOULD INFORMACIóN HOURS USED BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY PUT IN [inaudible] THE CONTINGENCY OF SOME OF ALL OF FUNDING BASED ON THE SUBMISSION OF MORE DETAIL -- I DON'T WANT TO FILL UP THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AGENDA PER SE BUT I WONDER IF -- IF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF WE APPROVED IT BUT ASKED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME BACK WITH THE DETAIL WITH BY A CERTAIN POINT. OKAY IN WE COULD GIVE YOU KNOW HAVE A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IS COLLECTING INFORMATION SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO FREEZE THE SPENDING. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ABOUT TO START FIRE SEASON. BUT WE COULD -- YOU KNOW PERHAPS SOME OF THEIR PROVE THE FULL AMOUNT BUT ALLOW FOR ONE HALF TO BE SPENT IN A WITHOUT RESTRICTION. AND THE OTHER HALF. BASED ON THAT BEFORE IT SPENT THAT THE REPORT COMES BACK AS TO HOW IT HOW YOU INTEND TO SPEND. INTERNET TO FACTOR IN THE FACT THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO START FIRE SEASON.
