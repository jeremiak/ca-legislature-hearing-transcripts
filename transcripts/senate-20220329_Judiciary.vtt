SAN FRANCISCO'S NEW ORDINANCE

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:18.643
ONLY PROTECTS PEOPLE FOR NON

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.279
PAYMENT OF RENT MOVING FORWARD

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:23.782
NOT FOR BACK RENT A BOAT SO

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.251
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:29.187
-- -- IS OWED BACK RENT

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:31.723
FROM THE STATE HI AND

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.192
IT HAPPENS ON JUNE

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.095
FIFTEENTH -- AND ALL THANK YOU

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.297
FOR THE QUESTION -- I THINK

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:40.532
THE CHALLENGES WITH PEOPLE WHO

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:42.133
HAVE APPLIED MONTHS AGO HAVEN'T

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.302
RECEIVED THOSE FUNDS AND IT IS

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:45.370
OUR HOPE THAT THERE THAT THOSE

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.738
FUNDS WILL BE RECEIVED AT THAT

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:48.273
POINT OKAY AND THAT IS WHAT IS

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.374
CRITICAL AND IT'S YOU KNOW I

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.576
THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT IS

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.044
NOT THE LANDLORD AND THE TENANT

00:26:53.111 --> 00:26:54.412
FAULT THAT THE STATE HASN'T

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:56.081
FUNDED AND NOT ENOUGH TIME

00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:57.248
RIGHT AND SO WE'RE BUYING MORE

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:58.550
TIME SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN BE

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.919
IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY SO IS

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:03.421
THERE AN EXPECTATION THAT THE

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:05.090
STATE WILL SATISFY ALL THESE

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.959
OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS BY JUNE

00:27:08.426 --> 00:27:11.096
-- BECAUSE AFTER THAT WE ARE NOW

00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:13.331
OFFICIALLY DONE THAT IS THE GOAL

00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:15.500
DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT IF IT'S

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.735
NOT ACHIEVE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:17.902
COMING BACK ASKING FOR ANOTHER

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:19.938
EXTENSION WELL I I BELIEVE THE

00:27:20.005 --> 00:27:22.640
THE THE FACTOR HERE IS THAT IS

00:27:22.707 --> 00:27:23.908
THAT THE MONEY THAT WERE CUT

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:25.210
THAT WAS COMING FROM THE FEDS

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:26.745
THE FUNDING COMING FROM THE FEDS

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:29.180
VERY SLOW IN ROLLING OUT TO

00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:30.615
THE STATE WHICH IS WHY THE

00:27:30.682 --> 00:27:32.517
STATE'S STALLED THE APPROVAL

00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:34.919
PROCESS NOW THAT THE FUNDING IS

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:36.988
PRESENT AND WE'RE READY TO GO

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:39.624
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD OF FULL

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.159
WITH THE PROCESS AS FAR AS THE

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.527

OF LOOKING AFTER TENANTS FOR

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:53.371
AS WELL AS LANDLORDS BECAUSE

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:56.207
BOTH WERE AFFECTED AND EACH HAD

00:27:56.408 --> 00:27:58.643
AN OBLIGATION TO TO ONE OR BOTH

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.879

WHO WE HAD ALREADY ASSISTED

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:51.576

ME I WANT TO THANK THE

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:56.514
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

-- ALL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS

00:31:58.383 --> 00:32:00.585

00:32:00.652 --> 00:32:03.288
FOR THE OUTREACH ON SATURDAY

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:05.390
AND IN MY AREA AND CENTRAL

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:07.225
LOS ANGELES WE HAD ANOTHER

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:09.994
HOUSING FAIR IN WHICH A HUNDRED

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:12.130
SEEMS LIKE SMALL BUT A HUNDRED

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:14.532
PEOPLE WERE ASSISTED THE

00:32:14.599 --> 00:32:17.035
-- MANY REASONS IN WHICH THEY

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.637
HAD NOT DONE IT BEFORE ONE IS

00:32:19.704 --> 00:32:21.773
-- THERE WERE YOU KNOW THERE

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:22.774
WERE SOME SENIORS WHO ARE

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.776
UNSURE HOW TO DO IT -- TO THE

00:32:24.842 --> 00:32:27.078
INTERNET -- THERE ARE THOSE

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:28.713
WHO DISTRUST GOVERNMENT NOT

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.048
SURE WHAT IT MEANT DO THEY

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:32.350
HAVE TO PAY IT BACK THEY'RE ALL

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:35.653
SORTS OF OF REASONS FOR THAT --

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.289
BUT I KNOW THAT -- THOUSANDS

00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:40.425
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN --

00:32:40.925 --> 00:32:43.528
HAVE BEEN ASSISTANT I THINK

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:46.664
WE NEED TO KEEP ON WORKING

00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:49.233
TO PROTECT ANYBODY NOBODY

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.035
SHOULD HAVE TO FACE EVICTION

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:52.570
AND SO I THINK IT'S OUR

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.138
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT JUST

00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:55.640

THE END OF IT ALL BUT

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:02.213
RATHER AND LET ANY --

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:05.516
LANDLORD THAT USES THIS AS

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:08.386
AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVICT

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.621
-- YOU KNOW REALLY NEEDS TO

00:33:10.688 --> 00:33:11.556
KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:12.990
LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY WILL

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:15.059
BE ATTORNEYS DEFENDING THOSE

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:17.295
TENANTS IF IT'S DONE IN

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:20.431
UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL WAY

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:22.900
WE WE PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:25.803
FACING EVICTIONS -- AND I THINK

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.271
THAT WAS THE WHOLE THING SO I

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:29.874
UNDERSTAND THAT -- THERE IS

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:32.076

MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.549
GETS OUT AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.051
SURE THAT ANY LANDLORD WHO

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:42.353
IS A TRIES TO ABUSE ANY

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.922

GOT SEVENTY TWO HOURS

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.970

WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED OR

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:03.441

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:56.727
AND THERE'S COUNTLESS EXAMPLES

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.628
OF THESE I THINK MY WITNESSES

00:49:58.695 --> 00:49:59.696
HAVE MADE IT MAY HAVE SOME OF

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:02.232

YOU KNOW AT A TIME WHEN WE DO

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:05.969
SEE A RISE WITH LIBERTARIANS

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.672
A RISE OF ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.741
LIMIT FREE SPEECH AND DISSENT

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:13.343
-- AND THE POLITICIZATION OF

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:14.544
SPEECHES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:16.713
FOR US AS A BODY HERE TO

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.682
REAFFIRM VERY LOUDLY AND CLEARLY

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:21.184
THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:22.652
JUST FREE SPEECH BUT ACADEMIC

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:25.155
FREEDOM AND THE ABILITY AND

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:27.224

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:35.932
WITHOUT FEAR OF REPERCUSSIONS

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:37.701
BECAUSE THEIR VIEWS ARE THE

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:38.769
DISCUSSION THEY'RE PROMOTING

00:50:38.835 --> 00:50:40.303
MIGHT MIGHT OFFEND SOMEBODY THAT

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.138
I THINK THAT'S REALLY REALLY

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.839

ACADEMIC IDEAS BUT WHAT I'M

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:26.616
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

THAT ALREADY EXIST SO I GUESS

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:58.048
MY POINT IN ALL THIS IS SHOULD

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.883
WE JUST BE REINVIGORATING

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:02.486

POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE BECAUSE

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:23.006
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.320
PROBLEMS WITH OUR SOCIETY TODAY

THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT SOLVE

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.857
ALL THOSE PROBLEMS BUT IT IT

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:42.092
TENDS TO PUSH IN THE RIGHT

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:43.326

EDUCATORS AND I THINK THAT'S

00:52:47.864 --> 00:52:48.965
IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU'VE JUST

COLLEAGUES BILLS IT OF LATE

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.774
AND -- I SO I THINK WITH

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.509
THERE'S A FIRST MORE COMMON

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:10.111
GROUND THAN ONE MIGHT EXPECT

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.547
-- THIS ISSUE HOWEVER

01:29:12.613 --> 01:29:14.849
IS NOT ONE OF THEM AND

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.617
I'M TRYING TO MAKE SENSE

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.720
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DRAMATIC

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.455
INTERNAL INCONSISTENCY HERE

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:23.858
MEANING THAT I WON LEVEL YOU

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.860
WANT TO DELEGATE IN RESPECT

01:29:25.927 --> 01:29:27.628
LOCAL CONTROL WHEN MATTERS

01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:28.730
ARE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:30.798
OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT IF

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.633
THOSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:33.835
NOT DOING THINGS THE WAY THAT

01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:35.636
YOU WISH TO BE DONE THEN THE

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.839
STRONG ARM OF THE STATE NEEDS

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:40.708
TO STEP IN IN THIS SITUATION

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:42.844
YOU'RE DIPPING YOUR TOES INTO

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:45.113
POND SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU'RE

01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.949
REMOVING LOCAL CONTROL WHEN

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.817
YOU DON'T LIKE THE RESULT AND

01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.620
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO OVERRIDE

01:29:52.954 --> 01:29:54.856
LOCAL CONTROL AFTER TEN YEAR

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:57.258
TIME PERIOD OF TIME AFTER

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:58.626
CONSTRUCTION NEW CONSTRUCTION IS

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:01.629
BUILT SO THIS REALLY IS

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:04.465
KIND OF A HODGE PODGE --

01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:07.135
THAT THE RESULT YOU WANT

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:09.837
IS ALREADY DETERMINED IN YOU'RE

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.439
TRYING TO FIND THE RATIONALE TO

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:13.808
REVERSE ENGINEER AND I'M

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:15.676
FINDING THAT THIS IS REALLY

01:30:16.744 --> 01:30:18.379
GOING TO CREATE NOT ONLY MORE

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:19.947
CONFUSION THE MARKET PLACE

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.250
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE INDIVIDUALS

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:23.317
THINKING THEY HAVE A WINDOW

01:30:23.384 --> 01:30:24.752
OF TEN YEARS WITHIN WHICH TO

01:30:24.819 --> 01:30:26.587
BUILD AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:28.790
THAT INVESTMENT -- BUT WAIT

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:30.691
YOU KNOW LIKE AN INFOMERCIAL

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.660
THERE'S MORE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:34.996
ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THE

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:36.697
MONEY THAT YOU PROJECTED OUT

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:38.132
WHICH IS THE UNDERPINNING OF

01:30:38.199 --> 01:30:39.333
MAKING THE INVESTMENT TO BEGIN

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.702
WITH SO I'M REALLY

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:42.870
HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THIS

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:45.840
ONE FOLKS IF WE DO BELIEVE

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:48.176
IN HOUSING THEN WE NEED TO

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:51.012
MAKE CERTAIN THAT HOUSING IS

01:30:51.245 --> 01:30:52.680
SOMETHING WE PUT AS A PRIORITY

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.816
AND MAKE IT EASY FOR FOLKS TO DO

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:57.985
IF WE BELIEVE THAT RENT CONTROL

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:00.488
IN LOCAL AUTHORITY IS SOMETHING

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:02.890
THAT WE BELIEVE IN THEM ALLOW

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.392
THAT TO HAPPEN BUT THIS HODGE

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.427
PODGE IS GOING TO HAVE THE

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.729
EXACT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.498
THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT IN MY

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.733
IN MY OPINION I THINK -- WE

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.502
HAVE SEEN THAT MOBILE HOMES

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:15.970
HAVE BEEN ATTACKED FOR THE

01:31:16.037 --> 01:31:18.139
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND I'M

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:19.207
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS IT

01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:20.675
REALLY BASED ON HOUSING WARS

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.777
BECAUSE IN CERTAIN INSTANCES

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:23.878
LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:26.314
ALLOWED -- TO CRAFT EXEMPTIONS

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.516
BECAUSE THEY WITH THEIR WISDOM

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:29.650
OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT IN THE

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.085
INSIGHTS OF THEIR COMMUNITY

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.454
DEEM THIS IMPORTANT -- TO KEEP

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.389
FOLKS INVESTING AND REINVESTING

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:37.391
-- FOR HOUSING PURPOSES SO

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:40.228
I'M ABSOLUTELY BEFUDDLED WITH

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:42.230
THE LOGIC OF THIS OF THIS

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:44.565
BILL -- -- -- I WON'T BE IN A

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:46.701
POSITION TO SUPPORT IT BUT I

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:48.302
I REALLY DO ASK MY COLLEAGUES

01:31:48.369 --> 01:31:49.704
IF THEY REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.939
HOUSING WHAT DIRECTION WE WANT

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:54.108
TO GO TO THE WANT RENT CONTROL

01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:56.744
OR DO THEY WANT -- TO INSPIRE

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:58.813
HOUSING -- IF YOU WANT TO

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.214
INSPIRE HOUSING YOU CAN'T

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:02.617
REVERT BACK TO LOCAL -- --

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.785
BRING CONTROLS JUST PICK A SIDE

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.588
WAS THAT A QUESTION

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:09.957
OKAY THEN I'LL ANSWER MY

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:12.093
CLOTHES MISTER CHARGES

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.395
ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY KASKI

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:18.165
I THINK I THINK I UNDERSTAND

01:32:18.232 --> 01:32:19.533
THE RENT CONTROL PORTIONS AND

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.469
WHY YOU HAVE TO TEN YEAR PERIOD

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:23.871
THERE IN THE PARAGRAPHS ABOUT

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.239
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:27.508
OWNERS MAKES SENSE I'M GONNA

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:28.843
GO BACK TO THE CONSTRUCTION

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:31.045
BECAUSE BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION'S

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.047
A LETTER SISTERS VIRTUALLY BEEN

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:35.716
NO CONSTRUCT NEW MOBILE HOME

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.518
PARKS BUILT IN SIXTY YEARS ARE

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.220
YOU WITNESSES SAYS THAT IN THE

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.022
LAST THIRTY TWO YEARS SINCE

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:43.190
NINETEEN NINETY THE SPACES HAVE

01:32:43.257 --> 01:32:44.492
INCREASED BY ONE AND A HALF

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:47.194
PERCENT SO IT SEEMS TO ME

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:49.163
THAT THAT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.332
IN BUILDING A MOBILE HOME PARK

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:53.100
AND YOU HAD CARP LAUNCHED TO

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:54.502
BILLS AND CHARGE WHATEVER RIGHT

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:55.870
YOU WANTED TO BECAUSE OF THE

01:32:57.004 --> 01:32:59.106
THE PROPONENTS CHARACTERIZATION

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.408
THAT THEY THINK THEY DON'T

01:33:00.474 --> 01:33:01.375
THEY'RE NOT COVERED BY ANY

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.110
LOCAL RENT CONTROL SO I GET

01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:04.445
THAT YOU GOT A CITY THAT HAS

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.013
RENT CONTROL BUT I COME IN WITH

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.315
A NEW MOBILE HOME PARK I'M NOT

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.850
SUBJECT TO THAT EVEN WITH THAT

01:33:10.284 --> 01:33:11.485
NOBODY IS BUILDING A NEW MOBILE

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.688
HOME PARKS THAT WOULD MEAN THAT

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:14.722
THERE'S VIRTUALLY HAS BEEN NO

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:16.090
MOBILE HOME PARKS BUILT IN THIS

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:17.792
THIRTY TWO YEARS SAID IT'S BEEN

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:21.028
ANYTHING GOES SO HOW DOES

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.431
PUTTING THE TENURE RECOVERY

01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:25.433
LIMIT ON THAT ACCELERATE THE

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:27.935
CONSTRUCTION OF PARKS I KNOW

01:33:28.002 --> 01:33:28.769
WHAT THAT'S WHAT IT DOES

01:33:28.836 --> 01:33:30.137
BUT I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:33.174
IT TO THE I GUESS IT'S THE

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.608
OPPOSITION IF YOU REALLY WANT

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:35.710
IF YOU WANT RENT CONTROL I GET

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.278
THAT BUT JUST ON BUILDING THE

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:39.513
PARKS HOW WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:42.116
BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT ALREADY

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:45.686
HELLO I I'M GONNA TAKE

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:46.654
THAT IS A QUESTION THAT

01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:47.655
WAS A CITIZEN RIGHT

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:50.825
OKAY IS BECAUSE THE --

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:54.762
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:56.831
CONSTRUCTING APARTMENTS AND

01:33:56.897 --> 01:33:58.132
CONSTRUCTING MOBILE HOME

01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:00.668
PARKS BECAUSE IN APARTMENTS OR

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:03.604
HOMES IT'S THE FULL DEAL

01:34:03.904 --> 01:34:06.307
YOUR YOUR WALLS ROOFS THE WHOLE

01:34:06.374 --> 01:34:08.409
BUSINESS IF YOUR MOBILE HOME

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.611
PARK YOUR CONSTRUCTING HOOK

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:13.247
UPS AND SPACES AND THE MOBILE

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.750
HOME IS BROUGHT IN AND OWNED

01:34:15.816 --> 01:34:18.152
BY THE INDEPENDENT TENET AND

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:20.254
SO IF THERE'S A FIFTEEN YEAR

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.223
AS WELL AS TALK THROUGH THAT

01:34:22.289 --> 01:34:23.557
MAY WELL BE APPROPRIATED FOR

01:34:23.624 --> 01:34:25.960
BUILDINGS THE ENTIRE THING BUT

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:28.796
IF YOUR -- DOING A PAD

01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.998
BUILDING HOOK UPS A TEN YEAR

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:33.434
RECOVERY IS A FAIR RATE OF

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:36.137
RETURN AND A LOGICAL TIME

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:38.572
TO RECOVER THAT I MEAN

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.708
I'M TALKING VOLUME I'M SAYING

01:34:40.775 --> 01:34:42.243
IN THIRTY TWO YEARS OF THE

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:43.677
YEAR WITNESSES SENSORS ONLY

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:45.446
ONE RIDER SENATE IT GETS TO

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.914
THE PREVIOUS COMMENT TO IN A

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:49.116
COUPLE OF VOICE AND AND ONE IS

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.352
TO MAKE A CLEAR POINT BECAUSE IT

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:53.454
MADE IT SOUND LIKE RENT CONTROL

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:55.489
WAS BEING OPPOSED IMPOSE FROM

01:34:55.556 --> 01:34:57.691
THE STATE BY THIS IS A LOCAL

01:34:57.758 --> 01:35:00.161
CHOICE THAT MANY OF THESE

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:02.797
SPACES DON'T HAVE RENT CONTROL

01:35:02.863 --> 01:35:04.065
BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A LOCAL

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:05.599
CHOICE OF THAT GOVERNMENT NOT

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:07.601
TO HAVE MOBILE HOME RENT CONTROL

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:09.136
THIS IS NOT AN IMPOSITION OF

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:11.739
IT THIS IS THE FACT THAT

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.875
OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:17.078
OF MOBILE HOME PARKS IN

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:18.712
HER SPACE IS IN CALIFORNIA

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:22.083
NINETY EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:24.085
COULD BE COVERED BY RENT

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:25.953
CONTROL IF THERE IS A LOCAL

01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.855
RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE IN PLACE

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:31.125
ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OR NOT

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:33.294
BECAUSE OF SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:35.830
ONE WAY PASSED THE BILL

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.965
THE TO REALIZE THE RATE OF

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.800
RETURN CAUSE FOR THE NINETY

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.602
EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT IT

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.637
IS BEEN A HISTORIC SOCIAL BARK

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:46.340
THAT THERE IS A FAIR RATE

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.075
OF RETURN THAT BECAUSE

01:35:48.142 --> 01:35:49.877
THE INVESTMENT AND CAUSTIC

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.378
CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN THE

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:53.981
PARK IN THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:55.449
HOSTAGES BECAUSE THEY OWN A

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:56.817
MOBILE HOME PARK AND IF THEY

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:58.519
WERE YOU AFFECTED THEIR STOCK

01:35:58.586 --> 01:35:59.553
BECAUSE THEY OWN THE THING ON

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:01.555
TOP OF THE SPACE AND IT GIVES

01:36:01.622 --> 01:36:03.924
THEM PROTECTION ON THE OTHER

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:06.193
PLACE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:36:06.393 --> 01:36:08.295
THAT IS FIXED THAT WORKS FOR

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:09.897
NINETY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.932
OF THE SPACES AND MORE AND

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:13.400
WHEN THIS WAS ENACTED THIRTY

01:36:13.467 --> 01:36:15.569
TWO YEARS AGO I DON'T THINK

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:17.438
IT WAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:20.541
THAT ANYTHING CONSTRUCTED IN

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.309
NINETEEN NINETY ONE WOULD BE

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:25.045
CONSIDERED NEW IN PERPETUITY AS

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:27.848
LONG SINCE AS THE RATE OF RETURN

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:29.917
AND THE VALUE BEEN RECOVERED BY

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.619
ANYBODY THAT INTERESTED IN THAT

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.687
PERIOD THIS CATCHES IT UP BUT

01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:36.123
HAS YOU POINTED OUT THERE HASN'T

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:37.825
BEEN A NEW ONE IN NINE YEARS

01:36:38.058 --> 01:36:40.461
THEREFORE THE OF THE ONE AND A

01:36:40.528 --> 01:36:42.163
HALF PERCENT THAT ARE COVERED

01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:44.031
THERE'S PROBABLY A LIKELIHOOD

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:45.399
THAT THEY'LL FALL AT THE RATE OF

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:47.968
RETURN ARE COME BACK TO

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.603
THEM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:51.438
THIS LAW PASSES HERE TODAY

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:53.874
AND I STILL THINK THERE'S THE

01:36:53.941 --> 01:36:56.210
INCENTIVE THERE BUT THE REASON

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.811
IT HASN'T BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN

01:36:57.878 --> 01:36:59.280
MANY WAYS FOR REASONS THAT ARE

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:01.482
WAY BEYOND THIS BILL AND IT IT

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:03.884
IS LAND COST IT IS MANY

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.519
OTHER THINGS AND IF WE'RE GOING

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:06.820
TO ADDRESS THAT WE'RE GOING

01:37:06.887 --> 01:37:08.656
TO DO IT IN OTHER WAYS THIS

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:10.257
IS ABOUT CATCHING UP THE LAW

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.359
TO TO SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:15.729

AUTHOR I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:25.739
THIS OR THE WITNESSES IN

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.141
OPPOSITION MIGHT WANT ANSWERED

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.676

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:31.545
IT BUT AS HAS BEEN STATED

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:34.281
-- INAL YOU KNOW SINCE NINETEEN

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:35.916
NINETY THERE THERE HAVEN'T BEEN

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:39.019
WHAT WHAT ONE NEW PARK BUILT

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:40.721
WHICH I ANY RATHER IT HAD BEEN

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:43.290
ONE -- HOWEVER MANY NEW PARKS

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:46.393
AND FOURTEEN FOURTEEN NEW PARK

01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.229
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY YES OKAY

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:51.031
SO ACTUALLY SAID THAT SINCE

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:53.500
TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S PROBABLY

01:37:53.567 --> 01:37:56.003
MORE THAN THAT OKAY -- I

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.372
I HAVE SHOWN AND -- SUPPORT

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.541
FOR RENT CONTROL AND -- MOBILE

01:38:00.608 --> 01:38:02.076
HOME PARKS IN THE PAST MY

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:04.178
HOME TOWN HAS AN ORDINANCE

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:05.246
A COUPLE OF THE OTHER CITIES

01:38:05.312 --> 01:38:06.513
IN MY DISTRICT DO SOME OF THE

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.215
CITY'S DON'T SO IT'S MAKES

01:38:08.282 --> 01:38:10.618
JUST LIKE YOU EXPLAINED --

01:38:10.684 --> 01:38:13.020
AND YOU KNOW THE REASONS FOR MY

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:14.555
SUPPORT OF RENT CONTROL MOBILE

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:16.156
HOME PARKS IS IS NOT A MARKET

01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:18.759
SITUATION IT'S YOU KNOW THE

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.928
THE TENANTS ARE TRAPPED IN YOU

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.396
KNOW TO SOME DEGREE FOR LACK

01:38:22.463 --> 01:38:24.331
OF A BETTER TERM ON THE LAND

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:26.934
THAT THEY'RE RENTING AND --

01:38:27.001 --> 01:38:28.435
YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE HOMES

01:38:28.736 --> 01:38:30.571
A STATE LAW HAS IS THEY'RE OLD

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:31.839
ENOUGH TO STAY ALIVE DOESN'T

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.607
ALLOW THEM TO BE MOVED IF

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.409
THERE WAS A NEW PARK TO OPEN

01:38:35.476 --> 01:38:36.710
UP FOR THEM FOR THERE TO BE

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:38.646
A COMPETITIVE MARKET SO YOU

01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:41.448
KNOW I I THINK THE BEST

01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:44.118
-- SITUATION FOR OWNERSHIP OF

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.419
THE PARKS IS EITHER FOR THE

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:47.921
PARKS THE RESIDENTS THAT RENT

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:49.590
THE SPACES TO OWN THE PARK

01:38:50.124 --> 01:38:51.759
OR FOR THE PARK OWNER THAT

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:54.361
OWNS THE PARK TO ALSO OWN

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:56.897
THE HOMES SO THAT EVERYTHING

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.299
CAN BE ON AN EQUAL PLAYING

01:38:58.365 --> 01:39:00.567
GROUND A AND A FREE MARKET --

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:02.369
UNFORTUNATELY IN MANY CASES

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:04.004
IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.173
THE CASE SO -- WE'VE COME UP

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.976
WITH AN IDEA TO PROTECT

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.945
THE HOMEOWNERS --

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:14.281
AND -- AND HOPEFULLY GIVE A RATE

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:15.816
OF RETURN TO THE PARK OWNERS

01:39:16.317 --> 01:39:18.385
MY QUESTION IS OF THE PARKS

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:19.586
THAT HAVE OPENED UP SINCE

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:22.756
NINETEEN NINETY THE RESIDENTS

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.892
MOVING IN THEIR HOMES INTO

01:39:24.958 --> 01:39:27.695
THOSE PARKS WOULD KNOW

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:30.264
THAT THEY'RE NOT PROTECTED BY

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.800
BREAKING TROLL AND THAT THEIR

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:35.669
SPACE IS GONNA BE AT MARKET

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:38.238
RATE WHATEVER THAT MARKET

01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:40.341
RATE IS INFERTILITY -- AS

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:42.409
LONG AS THEY ON THAT MARKET SO

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:45.612
-- WHAT'S IS THERE A

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:48.015
COMMON OR AIM I MORE

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:51.518
WHAT'S BEEN THE

01:39:51.885 --> 01:39:54.321
THE AGREEMENT SINCE NINETEEN

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:56.156
NINETY THE MOST COMMON AGREEMENT

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:57.591
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY BETWEEN

01:39:57.658 --> 01:39:59.893
THE PARK OWNERS AND THE

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.328
RESIDENTS THAT ARE MOVING THEIR

01:40:01.395 --> 01:40:03.297
HOMES INTO THOSE NEW PARKS

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.834
ARE WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:08.502
THE WITNESSES BECAUSE I'M NOT

01:40:08.569 --> 01:40:09.570
A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE THE

01:40:09.636 --> 01:40:11.972
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION --

01:40:12.272 --> 01:40:13.407
IT WOULD THAT BE OKAY MISTER

01:40:13.474 --> 01:40:16.076
CHAIR FOR THE WITNESSES DANCER

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:18.912
NOT SURE THANK YOU I THINK

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.814
I DON'T THINK THE PROCREATE

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:22.583
WOULD BE THE PARK OWNERS

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.650
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:24.852
ONE TAKE A SHOT AT THAT --

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:31.024
MR BY SAKE CAN ANSWER

THAT BE GREAT --

01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:35.662
IN A LETTER BUT I ALSO THINK IT

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:37.798
BE APPROPRIATE FOR A YEAR YOUR

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:40.000
SPONSOR ANSWERS WELL BUT FROM

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:42.169
OUR STANDPOINT THIS IS ABOUT

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:44.938
SPACES THIS IS AN ABOUT PARKS

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:48.375
SPACES CONSTRUCTED SHOULD

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:51.478
BE EXEMPT FROM STATEWIDE

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.847
RENT CONTROL THEY SHOULD BE

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.449
GRANDFATHERED IN UNDER THE

01:40:55.516 --> 01:40:57.384
EXISTING RULES AND REGULATIONS

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:58.685
THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.054
WE WANT TO BUILD MORE SPACES

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:04.124
THIS BILL UNDER A STARTING

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:06.160
IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:08.462
PREVENT THE ABILITY FOR OUR

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:10.431
PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY INCREASE

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:13.367

HERE OKAY BECAUSE WE HAVE AN

01:41:23.143 --> 01:41:25.446
ABILITY TO EXPAND WE'VE GOT

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.948
SPACE IN A LOT OF OUR PARKS

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:30.150
WE'VE GOT MAYBE TWENTY THOUSAND

01:41:30.217 --> 01:41:31.385
SPACES THAT COULD BE BUILT

01:41:31.452 --> 01:41:34.254
OVER NIGHT BUT THE DIFFERENCES

01:41:34.488 --> 01:41:36.256
IT TAKES UNLIKE AN APARTMENT

01:41:36.323 --> 01:41:38.258

AND WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY GET

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:51.939

HOME THAT COMES IN IS DELIVER

01:43:28.635 --> 01:43:30.904
ALL THE DEALER IS ACTUALLY

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:32.005
ORDERING THE HOME FROM THE

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:33.240
FACTORY AND PUTTING IT ON THE

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:35.509
SPACE AT THE DEALER IN MY

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:38.745
EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY PAYS A

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:41.081
PORTION OF THE SET UP COSTS FOR

01:43:41.148 --> 01:43:42.916
THE SPACE INITIALLY THAT'S ALL

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:44.618
NEGOTIATED WITH THE PARK OWNER

01:43:45.252 --> 01:43:47.220
THE COST TO CREATE A NEW SPACES

01:43:47.287 --> 01:43:49.423
CERTAINLY NOTHING LIKE THE COST

01:43:50.357 --> 01:43:51.692
CREATED YOU PARK WHERE YOU'RE

01:43:51.758 --> 01:43:52.893
CREATING ALL THE COMMENTARY

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.128
FACILITIES OF THE ROADS SO FOR

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:57.931
ARE WE JUST DON'T SEE THE COST

01:43:57.998 --> 01:43:59.833
OF THE SPACES BEING ANYTHING

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:02.102
INTO THAT SO I THINK THE

01:44:02.169 --> 01:44:04.071
INVESTMENTS THAT THEY'RE TALKING

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:05.739
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOUP

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:07.908
HERE IS REALLY IT'S BEEN A MESS

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:10.611
COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:12.179
INCOME THE AMOUNT OF CASH

01:44:12.245 --> 01:44:14.348
FLOW IT'S GOING TO BE CREATED

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:17.217
BY ADDING SPACES IN THE PARK

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:18.418
IF THAT'S WHAT THE PARKLAND

01:44:18.485 --> 01:44:20.354
WISHES TO DO THAT I'LL SEE

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.289
THIS AS A DISINCENTIVE AT ALL

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:23.890
I THINK IT'S A PRETTY MINOR

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:25.859
COST IF YOU WILL COMPARE TO

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:27.894
ALL OF THE NEW CASH FLOW IT

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:30.297
THIS NEW SPACE WILL CREATE

PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF SB

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:41.160
OF DOING SO WAS TO TRY AND

THIS IS SENATOR MENTIONED

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:51.137
DURING THE LAST ADMINISTRATION

01:56:51.204 --> 01:56:53.473
THERE WAS A FEAR OF

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:56.376
A MASS -- REMOVAL

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:57.610

OUR CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM

01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:12.091
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE

01:57:13.626 --> 01:57:15.328
WE'RE LESS LIKELY TO WANT TO

01:57:15.395 --> 01:57:16.896
COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:18.831
BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT DOING

01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:20.833
SO COULD LEAD TO THEIR

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:33.079
THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION

01:57:33.613 --> 01:57:35.448
IS FAR MORE LAW ABIDING

01:57:35.815 --> 01:57:37.917
THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION

01:57:38.151 --> 01:57:39.919
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FEAR OF

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:42.088
COMING IN CONTACT WITH LAW

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:45.024
ENFORCEMENT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:47.360
THAT THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:49.629
IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:57:49.695 --> 01:57:52.231
VICTIMS OF CRIME THAN THE

01:57:52.298 --> 01:57:54.901
GENERAL POPULATION PERSONALLY

01:57:54.967 --> 01:57:57.570
BECAUSE OF THAT FEAR OF

01:57:57.637 --> 01:57:59.305
COOPERATING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:58:01.707 --> 01:58:04.510
WHEN YOU HAVE WITNESSES

01:58:04.577 --> 01:58:06.712
AND VICTIMS AFRAID TO COME

01:58:06.779 --> 01:58:09.382
TO COURT WHAT THAT DOES

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:12.351
IS EMBOLDEN THE CRIMINAL

KNOWING THAT THERE ARE FAR

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:21.861
MORE LIKELY TO GET AWAY WITH

01:58:21.928 --> 01:58:22.895
IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:25.064
COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:58:25.865 --> 01:58:28.501

YEARS I WAS A POLICE OFFICER

01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:33.439
SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE THAT

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:37.710
THE FEAR IN THESE

01:58:37.777 --> 01:58:40.746
COMMUNITIES IS VERY REAL AND

01:58:42.114 --> 01:58:44.884
HAVING SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:46.919
UNINTENTIONALLY SUNSET

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.323
IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO MORE

01:58:50.389 --> 01:58:52.191
VICTIMIZATION THE HIGHER CRIME

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:54.026

PROTECTIONS WERE IN PLACE AT

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:59.599
A TOTALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:02.101
RECORD KEEPING BUT I CHECKED

MATERNITY HAD TO BE DISCIPLINED

01:59:12.044 --> 01:59:13.412

PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW AND

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:16.382
AND NOBODY COULD FIND ANY

01:59:18.217 --> 01:59:19.552
THE MERE FACT THAT THE STATUTE
