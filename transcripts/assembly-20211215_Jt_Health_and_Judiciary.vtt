ALL OVER THOUGHT SHOULD BE THE

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.352
CARE AND CONCERN OF SOME OF OUR

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.923
MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS- MR

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:22.013
COMPLICATING ISSUES THOUGH ARE

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.149
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:27.352
STANDPOINT REAL LACK OF

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:27.919
APPROPRIATE SERVICES AT THE

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:29.854
LOCAL LEVEL. TO BE ABLE TO

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.823
PROVIDE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE AS

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.024
NEEDED AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.293
OF INCONSISTENCY COUNTY THE

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.561
COUNTY NOT NECESSARILY THEIR

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:38.663
FAULT BUT A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.999
IN. THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:43.702
IN SUPPORT OF COUNTIES SO ONE OF

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:47.305
THE CHALLENGES IS THAT IF WE ARE

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:49.441

WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO BE CONSERVE

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:56.348
THEN I THINK FIRST WE NEED TO

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:58.083

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:59.784

THE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS FOR

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:03.722
PEOPLE TO GO. I THINK THIS WILL

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.623
BE A BIT OF A DEEP DIVE IT IS

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.193
GOING TO BE A LONG A LONG DAY SO

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:09.260
WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE

00:27:09.327 --> 00:27:10.929

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT

00:58:52.829 --> 00:58:55.732
OCCURS. AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

AVAILABLE FUNDING AT EACH OF

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:58.334
THESE TOUCH POINTS. BOB SO

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:01.971

FUNDING FOR THE LPS ACTS SYSTEM

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:11.447
OF CARE. THE FIRST KEY TAKE AWAY

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:12.949
IS THAT ASSESSING FUNDING FOR

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.151
THE LPS ACT IS COMPLEX AND

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:17.453
DIFFICULT THE LPS ACTED IN ENACT

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:19.689
A SPECIFIC PROGRAM TO BE FUNDED

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:22.859
IT RATHER CREATED A SYSTEM FOR

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:23.393
INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:25.228
TREATMENT STATEWIDE-

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:26.763
IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.197
THE ACT OCCURS ACROSS MULTIPLE

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.899
SYSTEMS INCLUDING OUTSIDE OF THE

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:31.634
HEALTH SYSTEM- AND THERE ARE

00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:32.902
MULTIPLE ENTITIES INCLUDING

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.470
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT CAN

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:37.006
CONDUCT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.875
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT. IN

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.310
ADDITION EACH OF THESE ENTITIES

00:59:40.376 --> 00:59:42.278
HAS DISTINCT FUND SOURCES AT

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:43.947
THEIR DISPOSAL- THAT THEY CAN

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:47.283
USE FOR LPS ACT RELATED PURPOSES

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.885
- ADDING TO THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.386
ASSESSING FUNDING FOR THE ACT.

00:59:50.453 --> 00:59:51.688
IS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NO

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.256
DEDICATED FUNDING STREAMS TO

00:59:53.323 --> 00:59:54.857
SPECIFICALLY TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:57.093
LPS ACT- SPENDING ON

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.594
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT

00:59:58.661 --> 01:00:01.030
GENERALLY COMES FROM BROADER

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:02.098
FUND SOURCES THAT CAN ALSO BE

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:04.767
USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES- ONE

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.235
NOTABLE EXAMPLE HERE ARE THE

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.671
VARIOUS POTS OF- FUNDING THAT

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.506
COUNTIES HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:11.107
TO FUND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:13.643
SERVICES- FURTHERMORE WHEN

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.545
SPENDING DOES OCCUR. FROM THESE

01:00:15.611 --> 01:00:17.914
BROADER POTS OF FUNDING IT IS-

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.048
GENERALLY NOT TRACKED AS

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.616
DIRECTLY FOR LPS ACT

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:23.286
IMPLEMENTATION- AND SO THIS

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.321
MAKES IT ULTIMATELY UNCLEAR WHAT

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:27.156
SPECIFIC SHARE OF THESE BROADER

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:29.092
FUND SOURCES ARE ULTIMATELY

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.427
SPENT ON LPS ACT RELATED

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:33.830
ACTIVITIES SPECIFICALLY- OUR

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.665
NEXT KEY TAKE AWAY. IS THAT

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.700
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LPS ACT

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:38.935
INVOLVES A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:41.170
ACTIVITIES TYPICALLY THE MOST

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.739
PROMINENT EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:43.773
MIND WHEN THINKING ABOUT

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.408
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACT- ARE

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.310
DIRECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.245
FOR INDIVIDUALS ON LPS HOLD OR

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:51.314
CONSERVATORSHIP- BUT THIS IS

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:52.315
JUST ONE PART OF THE WHOLE

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.384

FOLKS WITH- MENTAL HEALTH

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.125
SERVICES BEFORE THE POINT WHERE

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.126
THEY EVER REACH THE NEED TO BE

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.727
PLACED ON AN LPS HOLD OR

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.796
CONSERVATORSHIP- THERE ARE OTHER

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.798
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE HOUSING

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:11.901
THAT- CAN SUPPORT SORT OF THE

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.603
ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF FOLKS THAT

01:01:13.669 --> 01:01:14.370
ARE UNDER AN LPS

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.039
CONSERVATORSHIP- AND THEY'RE

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.707

DID WANT TO ASK AND THIS IS OF

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:49.044
CHIEF- ITO OR REAL. PAGE TEN AND

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.879
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:53.281
IT TALKS ABOUT THE REPORTS AND

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.684
THE FACT THAT. MORE THAN 50% OF

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.852
THE COUNTIES. DO NOT PROVIDE

01:20:57.919 --> 01:21:00.422
ACCURATE. INFORMATION ABOUT

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:02.490
THEIR LPS DETENTIONS AND IT GOES

01:21:02.557 --> 01:21:04.759
ON TO DESCRIBE HOW SOME OF THE

01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:06.861
PROVIDE NO INFORMATION SOME OF

01:21:06.928 --> 01:21:10.498
IT IS INACCURATE INCOMPLETE. THE

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.467
MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.836
PARAGRAPH ON PAGE TEN IS IT SAID

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.338
THAT THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES

01:21:16.404 --> 01:21:18.273
TO COUNTIES WHO FAIL TO EITHER

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.141
REPORT DATA OR PROVIDE

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:23.178
INCOMPLETE DATA. WHAT DO WE DO

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:26.948
TO CORRECT THIS. HUESO CURRENTLY

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.717
LIKE I SAID BECAUSE THERE IS NO

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:31.886
EXISTING CONSEQUENCE- BUT THERE

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.488
IS A REQUIREMENT FOR COUNTIES TO

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.991
REPORT SO REALLY WHAT WE'RE AT

01:21:36.057 --> 01:21:38.293
DH CS LOOKING TO DO IS TO BUILD

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.194
BETTER COMMUNICATION

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.729
COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTIES

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.664
WE ARE GOING BACK AND WE ARE

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.199
LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION WE

01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:46.434
ALSO ARE LOOKING AT INTERNALLY

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:47.769
ARE WE HAVING ANY ISSUES WITH

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.138
OUR REPORTING MECHANISMS. MAKING

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.741
SURE THAT THERE IS AN F. YOU

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:53.742
KNOW SOMETHING OCCURRING

01:21:53.808 --> 01:21:55.777
INTERNALLY WITH THE REPORTING

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:57.946
SYSTEM SO WE ALSO WANT TO LOOK

01:21:58.013 --> 01:22:00.282
AT THAT. THEIR- ARE A LOT OF

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:01.516
THINGS GOING FORWARD THAT WE

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.318
WANT TO IMPROVE ON AND MAKE SURE

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:05.854
THAT WE ARE NOT. USING THE SAME

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.289
DATA WE WANT TO GET BETTER

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:08.990
ACCURATE MORE DATA SO AGAIN

01:22:09.057 --> 01:22:10.759
WE'RE LOOKING AT MULTIPLE WAYS

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.694
TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.195
SO I. I'M SURE THAT YOU

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:16.064
UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:17.265
DIFFICULT FOR POLICYMAKERS AND

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.267
TO DETERMINE WHAT OUR

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.835
COMMUNITIES NEED. AND WHETHER

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:23.038
OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.006
NEEDS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING. SO

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:28.910
IF THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES AND

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:30.945
FOR YEARS YOU ALL HAVE TRIED TO

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:33.081
. I THINK YOU SAID TO REMIND

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:34.249
THEM OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:22:34.316 --> 01:22:36.151
REPORT I THINK IS. WHAT YOU HAD

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.386
SAID AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:41.089
THEN PERHAPS NOW THERE NEEDS TO

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:41.923
BE CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.725
REPORTING. AND THAT WOULD BE

01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:45.493
SOMETHING THAT IS POLICYMAKERS

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.696
WE THEN CAN INCLUDE. WOULD YOU

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:49.497
AGREE THAT THAT IS A ONE OF

01:22:49.564 --> 01:22:53.968
THOSE POSSIBILITIES. I WOULD

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:55.904
WHAT I WANT TO JUMP INTO I'M

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:58.039
JUST TO. RESTATE THAT WE DON'T

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:00.008
HAVE ANY AUTHORITY AT DH THE

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:02.410
PAST FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES- SO

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:03.912
LIKE CHEN I WAS STATING WORDS

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.413
WERE USING ALL THE TOOLS THAT WE

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.349
CAN. TO ASSIST COUNTY SWEAT

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:09.150
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON BUT

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:11.119
UNLESS WE HAVE SOME SORT OF A

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:12.153
BROADER AUTHORITY FOR

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.989
CONSEQUENCES AND THEN JUST ALSO

01:23:15.056 --> 01:23:16.925
TO AND RELATE BACK THAT THERE IS

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:19.494
NO. FUNDING TIED TO LPS COUNTIES

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.895
ARE USING DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:23.131
SOURCES BUT THE STATE DOESN'T

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:24.265
HAVE. A PARTICULAR FUNDING

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:27.335
SOURCE FOR LPS AND SO THEY'RE

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:28.470
YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF OUR

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.972

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:43.785
AGREE THAT THE DAY COLLECTION IS

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:44.386
EXTREME IMPORTANT ORCHARD IN

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:46.020
ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT TO DO

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:49.157
NEXT. WEEK WE CAN'T EVALUATE IN

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.291
LESS WE KNOW WHAT'S WORKING

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:53.094
WHAT'S NOT WORKING. AND IT TO

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:56.164

YEARS EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW WE'VE

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:28.923
BEEN HISTORICALLY OVER FUNDED. I

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.125
THINK IT IS NOW THE TIME THAT

01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:39.300
JUST TO REALLY MONITOR ALL OF

01:25:39.367 --> 01:25:40.435
THAT FUNDING THAT'S GOING OUT

01:25:40.502 --> 01:25:41.836

01:25:44.038 --> 01:25:44.772

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.474
EFFECTIVELY GO FORWARD AND

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:48.610
SOMETIMES THAT'S HARDER TO DO

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:49.210
I'M JUST IN A REGULAR SESSION

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:50.678

SAME TIME. SO THAT SAID- JUST

01:25:57.852 --> 01:26:00.522
HISTORICALLY SO WE FACED OUT THE

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.223
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND

HELP ME REMEMBER BUT I IT WAS

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:05.159

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.868
EVERYTHING WAS ESTABLISHED BUT

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:15.370
THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.804
OCCURRED WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:18.907
COMMUNITY RESOURCE AS WE PHASE

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:19.507

KIM THE NASH FLOOD AND TO MAKE A

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:26.240
- ON THAT I THINK CHECK

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:28.042
KNOWLEDGE. HONEST MEMBER. THE

01:37:28.108 --> 01:37:29.410
POINT THAT THERE'S A VERY

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:31.212
FRAGMENTED BEER HALL SYSTEM IN

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:34.081
CALIFORNIA- WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:36.317
PAPERS LIKE MEDICAID AND- EVEN

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:37.885
THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:40.187
ARE CARVED OUT. FROM MANAGEMENT

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:41.222
FROM THE REST OF THE HEALTHCARE

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:43.290
DELIVERY SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT

01:37:43.357 --> 01:37:45.359
ALSO MAKES THAT. TRANSITION MORE

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:48.028
ON CHALLENGING AND THEN VARIOUS-

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:49.263
THERE SHOULDN'T BE A LOT OF

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:52.233
UNINSURED PEOPLE LEFT IN IN THIS

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:54.068
WORLD WITH THE ACA HAVING

01:37:54.134 --> 01:37:56.270
EXPANDED MEDICAID. AND SO A LOT

01:37:56.337 --> 01:37:57.671
OF I THINK THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:59.740
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID IF THEY'RE

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:01.342
OVER INCOMES AND- CERTAINLY

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:02.276
THEY'RE MORE CHALLENGES GETTING

01:38:02.343 --> 01:38:03.811
IN THERE AND SHOULD PRIVATE

01:38:03.877 --> 01:38:05.813
INSURANCE TO PAY FOR- SOME OF

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:07.581
THESE SERVICES BUT- I DO BELIEVE

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:10.117
THE REAL SOLUTION. AS WE TALK

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:12.219
ABOUT IT IS BALLS TWO THINGS ONE

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:14.488
IS- TO EXPAND ON I THINK WHAT

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.590
THE IMAGES THEY PROMISED IN ITS-

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:20.527
INITIAL- SORT OF PROPAGANDA

01:38:20.594 --> 01:38:21.362
AROUND DEVELOPING THEM- MENTAL

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:22.229
HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:23.697
THAT. THERE ARE SUPPORT OF

01:38:23.764 --> 01:38:25.232
HOUSING PROGRAMS LIKE AB THIRTY

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:26.967
AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR THAT WERE

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:28.369
REALLY THE MODEL FOR IT IT'S

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:31.038
ACIDS. AND THOSE WERE ABOUT.

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:33.474
HANNAH PROVIDING THAT REALLY

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.709
REALLY SPECIFIC SUPPORTIVE MODEL

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:36.944
OF GETTING PEOPLE BURST INTO

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.078
HOUSING AND KEEPING THEIR

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:39.747
HOUSING THROUGH A SUPPORT OF

01:38:39.813 --> 01:38:41.882
INTEGRATED PROGRAM. SO I THINK

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:42.916
THOSE ARE MATURE THOSE WERE

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.752
THERE WAS. ALSO DATA AND

01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:46.353
LEGISLATIVE RECORD THAT SHOWED

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:47.988
HOW EFFECTIVE THAT WAS. IN

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:48.989
REDUCING HOSPITALIZATION

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:51.225
REDUCING CAR SERRATION ALL OF

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:52.226
THOSE THINGS THAT WE ARE TRYING

01:38:52.293 --> 01:38:53.894
TO DO AND SO I THINK THAT IS A

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:55.629
REALLY CRITICAL. HE SAID WE NEED

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:58.165
TO GET BACK TO ADEQUATELY FUND

01:38:58.232 --> 01:38:59.233
ADEQUATELY HAVE AVAILABLE

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.934
STATEWIDE THAT'S A HUGE

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:02.970
CHALLENGE FOR SURE. AND THEN THE

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:04.038
SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM REALLY

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.306
NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED AND

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:07.274
EXPANDED THERE IS A CHALLENGE

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:09.009
GETTING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH.

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.344
AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES.

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:12.313
ACROSS THE STATE SO TO SAY

01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:13.747
THERE'S DIRT THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:16.050
SERVICES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IS

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:21.255
TO BE TRUE AND IT'S. WORSE NOW

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:21.922
WITH THE PANDEMIC. SO HOW ARE WE

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:23.057
GOING TO THROUGH. GIVE PEOPLE

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:23.857
MORE INVOLVED JUVENILE THEY

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:25.025
CAN'T SERVICE WHEN THEY NEED

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:25.626
THEM A ONE THEM SO I THINK WE

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:27.261
REALLY TO ACT PASS CITY BUILD.

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:29.363
BEFORE WE LOOK AT SORT OF GOING

01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:31.665
BACK TO THE APPROACH OF TRYING

01:39:31.732 --> 01:39:33.667
TO EXPAND THE WAY TO GET PEOPLE

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:34.802
IN THE SYSTEM THAT DON'T.

01:39:34.868 --> 01:39:36.804
CURRENTLY A QUOTE WANNABE IN

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.672

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:57.424
PRESENTATION ON THAT THE POLICY

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:59.560
THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY

01:39:59.626 --> 01:40:00.994
EIGHTEEN ON THE CONSERVATORSHIP

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.763
AND THIS THREE COUNTIES BUT BUT

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.298
BEFORE I GET THERE I CAN CARE

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:06.066
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:40:06.133 --> 01:40:07.468
ISSUE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AND

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:09.236
ECONOMIC HEARING SEVEN RIGHT

01:40:09.303 --> 01:40:12.840

BASIS. WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:20.881
HOMELESSNESS AND ADDICTION AND

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.950
NOT ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAVE THE

01:40:23.016 --> 01:40:25.018
SAME. BUT THERE'S A REAL.

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:26.754
INTERSECTION NETWORKS THAT WERE

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.355
SAYING AND- YEAH I DON'T THINK

01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:29.590
IT'S A BAD IDEA TO HAVE A

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:30.924
SPECIAL SESSION ADDRESSING ALL

01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:33.193
THOSE ISSUES. AS OUR SENATOR

SAID- AND I ALSO NOTE THAT THAT

01:40:35.996 --> 01:40:37.131
NOT I THANK EVERY SHOULD THE

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:38.699
SECOND SPEAKER SAID THAT NOT

ALL. ON MENTAL AND LARA'S LAW

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:42.403
NOT ALL PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:45.572
ILLNESS ARE VIOLENT- IN NOT ALL

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:47.207
PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS NEED.

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:49.276
ON CONFINEMENT ATTACK TAKE CARE

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:51.512
OF OURSELVES BUT- AS MY

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:52.946
COLLEAGUE REPRESENTS SKID ROW

01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:54.448
SAYS HE WALKED ON OUR

01:40:54.515 --> 01:40:56.250
COMMUNITIES ALL THOUGHT ALL.

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:58.252
TAKE YOU CAN TALK TO OUR NEW

01:40:58.318 --> 01:40:58.819
POLICE CHIEF HERE WHO'S THE

01:40:58.886 --> 01:41:00.587
CAPTAIN DOWNTOWN. AND WALKED

01:41:00.654 --> 01:41:02.189
THROUGH CASE THREE AND TEN POINT

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:04.825
OUT INDIVIDUALS WHO THEY'RE FREE

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:05.993
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LIVE THEIR

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:07.928
LIVES. BUT IT'S NOT WORKING FOR

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:09.797
THEM THEIR FAMILIES THE

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.765
COMMUNITY NORTHERN BUSINESSES

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:14.701
SO. THE STATUS QUO HAS TO CHANGE

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:17.237
THIS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE SO I

01:41:17.304 --> 01:41:18.839
APPRECIATE THIS HEARING. I DON'T

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:20.374
WANT TO JUST DIG IN ON THAT BILL

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:23.110
THAT WE PASSED IN TWENTY.

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:24.778
EIGHTEEN AND I WATCHED IT I

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:26.413
PROCEED I WASN'T ON EITHER THE

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.749
COMMITTEES WERE WENT THROUGH. I

01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:29.883
THINK I SAID IN ONE DAY SO I DID

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:32.052
HEAR THE DEBATE AND I THINK THE

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:34.555
FINAL- CONCLUSION WAS IN THOSE

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:36.523
THREE COUNTIES. INDIVIDUAL HAD

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:39.760
TO BE- CONFINED. NOT CONFINED

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:41.929
HAD TO BE. BROUGHT IN BY THE

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.230
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EIGHT

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:45.332
TIMES OVER A TWELVE MONTH.

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.035
PERIOD FOR IT TO TRIGGER- I

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:49.203
THINK AT THE TIME THAT SOUNDED

01:41:49.269 --> 01:41:52.206
LIKE A HIGH NUMBER. HI IT IS IT

01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:53.740
WORKING I'VE HEARD ANECDOTAL

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.476
REPORTS THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:57.778
FRANCISCO. ONLY LIKE TWO OR

01:41:57.845 --> 01:41:59.847
THREE PEOPLE THAT IT'S ACTUALLY-

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:01.181
WORKED WITH AND I DON'T KNOW IF

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.349
THAT'S THE TYPE OF THE

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:04.251
APPROPRIATE. AMOUNT WHAT WE ARE

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:06.253
LOOKING FOR CAN YOU GIVE US YOUR

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:13.293
ANALYSIS ON. THE BILL THREE FOUR

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.127
YEARS LATER- HOW. POLICY IS

01:42:14.194 --> 01:42:15.229
WORKING AND IS IT EACH THE GOAL

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:18.065
THAT WE OUT FOR- I THINK IT'S A

01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.132
VERY GOOD QUESTION IN TERMS OF

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:21.368
HOW IT'S WORKING- YOU KNOW THE-

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:23.237
PURPOSE OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE

01:42:23.303 --> 01:42:24.805
SHIPS AS THEY AS I UNDERSTAND

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.440
THEM WERE A- HOUSING.

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:29.743
CONSERVATIVE PILOT SO- I THINK

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.112
CRITICALLY THE VERY FIRST

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:33.847
QUESTION WOULD BE HOW IS THE

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:36.149
HOUSING COMPONENT OF THAT. IN

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:38.352
OTHER WORDS HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:40.153
BECAUSE IT'S A BROADER LPS

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.789
CRITERIA THAT ALLOWS THAT COUNTY

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:44.925
CHIU INTERVENING AND DETERMINES

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.159
UPGRADE TO DISABLE INPUT ON A

01:42:46.226 --> 01:42:48.862
CONSERVATORSHIP- IN A BROADER

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.097
WITH A BROADER GREAT DISABILITY

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:52.299
STANDARD. ON EVEN THOUGH AS YOU

01:42:52.366 --> 01:42:55.168
SAY YOU HAVE TO BE FIFTY ONE

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:55.969
FIFTY EIGHT TIMES STOP BY LAW

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.704
ENFORCEMENT COULD REALLY BE BY

01:42:57.771 --> 01:42:59.273
ANYONE WE HAVE A VERY EXPENSIVE

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:02.142
L. FIFTY ONE FIFTY THIRTY. THAT

01:43:02.209 --> 01:43:03.210
THE COUNTY CAN AUTHORIZE TECH

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:04.711
TEAM PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY

01:43:04.778 --> 01:43:06.013
RESPONSE TEAMS A LOT OF

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:07.080
DIFFERENT FOLKS COULD BRING

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:09.316
SOMEBODY IN TO THE SYSTEM SO. I

01:43:09.383 --> 01:43:11.051
THINK IT'S IT ISN'T JUST POLICE

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:13.687
INVOLVEMENT THERE AS WELL BUT

01:43:13.754 --> 01:43:15.856
THERE WAS A- IT LEGISLATIVE

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.291
FINDING RECOMMENDATION WAS

01:43:17.357 --> 01:43:19.726
SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY JANUARY

01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:20.327
ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH I

01:43:20.394 --> 01:43:21.862
HAVE NOT. BEEN ABLE TO FIND BUT

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.263
I THINK LOOKING AT THAT AND WHAT

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:24.598
THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY FINDINGS

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:26.567
WERE IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND HOW

01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:28.402
SUCCESSFUL WAS AND WHAT WAS THE

01:43:28.468 --> 01:43:29.870
REASON IT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL IF

01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:31.738
IT WASN'T AND THEN SECONDLY YOU

01:43:31.805 --> 01:43:33.407
KNOW THAT. THERE IS ALSO A

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:36.276
LEGISLATIVE. RESPONSE TO IN

01:43:36.343 --> 01:43:38.579
JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:39.913
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON THAT

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:41.582
SPECIFIC PROGRAM IN THOSE PILOTS

01:43:41.648 --> 01:43:43.650
SO. VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.919
ABOUT. IF THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL

01:43:45.986 --> 01:43:47.754
Y. AND IF THEY WERE NOT

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:49.122
SUCCESSFUL WHY NOT I THINK THAT

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:51.191
ISTHE REAL KEY QUESTION AND I

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:52.025
THINK IT IS ONE THAT STILL OUT

01:43:52.092 --> 01:43:54.194
THERE- BUT I KNOW THERE WILL BE

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:56.096
OTHER PANELIST SPEAKING TO SOME

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:57.764
OF THE LIMITATIONS. IN SOME OF

01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:00.100
THOSE VERY COUNTIES WHERE- WE

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:02.202
KNOW THAT ACCESS IS BEING VERY

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:04.671
DIFFICULT AND EVEN WITH THESE

01:44:04.738 --> 01:44:06.206
EXPANDED AUTHORITIES TO

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:08.175
INVOLUNTARILY TREAT PEOPLE IT

01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:09.309
HASN'T BEEN IN ITSELF THE

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.477
SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:17.384
SOMETHING TO. OFFER ON THE OTHER

01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:18.785
SIDE OF THAT. YES I OF A FALL UP

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:19.987
QUESTION. IS YOUR RIGHT SO IT'S

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.755
NOT USING THE TOOL WHAT'S

01:44:21.822 --> 01:44:22.689
HAPPENING SOMETHING AT THE BACK

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:23.957
END BUT MY UNDERSTANDING THEY

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.525
WOULDN'T UTILIZE THE TOOL OF

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:29.930
INVOLUNTARY- A POLICY UNLESS

01:44:29.997 --> 01:44:31.031
THERE'S SOMEONE TO TAKE THE

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:33.033
INDIVIDUAL. CELLS ASSUMING THAT

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.701
IS ACCURATE NEEDS THREE COUNTIES

01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:35.869
AND THEY DO UTILIZE THIS

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:39.006
OPPORTUNITY. DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:40.974
ANY INFORMATION ON ON HIS THAT

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:43.076
NUMBER IS THAT THE RIGHT IS THAT

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:45.379
NUMBER TOO HIGH ART ARE THESE.

01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:47.047
ANECDOTAL STORIES ABOUT SAN

PEOPLE HAVING IT TRIGGERED IS

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:51.952
THAT ACCURATE AND DOES THAT TELL

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:53.420
US ANYTHING ABOUT. WHETHER OR

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:57.457
NOT THE NUMBER EIGHT. IS THAT

01:44:57.524 --> 01:45:16.343
THE WRONG NUMBER.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.214
THE PROCESS TO

01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:23.016
GET PEOPLE INTO THAT SAME PLACE

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.518
AND ACCEPT THOSE SAME SERVICES

01:45:24.584 --> 01:45:26.720
AND ALSO BE HOUSE. IS A REALLY

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:28.555
IMPORTANT AND SUCCESSFUL MODEL

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:30.757
AND WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:31.958
ABOUT PATIENT TREATMENT FOR

01:45:32.025 --> 01:45:34.861
EXAMPLE EVEN AS A NATIONAL-

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.163
BEING STILL BEING STUDIED THERE

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:37.864
ARE NOT THERE'S NOT EVIDENCE TO

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.800
SUPPORT THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS AN

01:45:39.866 --> 01:45:41.501
IMPACT AND THEN THE INVOLUNTARY

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:42.836
COMPONENT OF IT. IS THE

01:45:42.903 --> 01:45:44.871
SUCCESSFUL PART THERE ARE OTHER

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:45.572
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE LIKE

01:45:45.639 --> 01:45:47.607
ASSISTANT- I'M COMMUNITY

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:49.376
TREATMENT MODELS THAT DO THAT

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:50.877
TENDENCY SUPPORT AND HOUSING

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:53.180
SUPPORT THAT. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:54.881
BE EFFECTIVE NATIONALLY SO I

01:45:54.948 --> 01:45:56.450
THINK IT'S REALLY DOUBLING DOWN

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:57.651
ON WHAT IS OF EVIDENCE BASED

01:45:57.718 --> 01:45:58.985
PRACTICE ON WHAT IS A FACTOR

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:00.887
PRACTICE AND WHY DON'T WE DO

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:03.990
MORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER

01:46:04.057 --> 01:46:05.792
CHAIR- DOCTOR REGULATE I'VE I

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:07.160
JUST I JUST KNOW WE WERE WE HAD

01:46:07.227 --> 01:46:09.029
A THREE MINUTE HEAD START AND WE

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:10.230
ARE NOW FIFTEEN MINUTES BEHIND

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:13.934
SO- BUT ANYWAY I THINK I'M NOT

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.534
TRYING TO DETER YOU IN ANYWAY.

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:18.138

WILL START WITH THE FRAMING

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:24.478
COMMENT IF I CAN ABOUT LPS I.

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.646
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO.

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:28.348
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS NOT A

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:31.017
DISCUSSION THAT IS PENDING YOUR

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:33.453
ABILITY TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE OR

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:35.655
MENTALHEALTH CARE VERSUS. SELF

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:38.258
DETERMINATION. IT'S INSTEAD

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:40.827
REALLY EVALUATING THE SYSTEMS OF

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:42.896
CARE. AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE

01:46:42.963 --> 01:46:45.966
WHO ARE IN CRISIS ARE LOCKED UP.

01:46:46.032 --> 01:46:47.334
OR WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE ABLE

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.169
TO ACCESS THE APPROPRIATE MENTAL

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.437
HEALTH AND PHYSICAL CARE THAT

01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:52.506
THEY- SHOULD BE GIVEN. AND SO

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:54.074
I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE

01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:56.843
CAPACITY QUESTION AS I. DO THINK

01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.078
IT'S THE IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR

01:46:58.145 --> 01:47:00.647
US TO ADDRESS. AS A STATE AND

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:01.214
LOOKING TOWARDS OUR COUNTY

01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:03.283
PARTNERS. WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.751
INVESTMENTS WE'VE MADE IN THE

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:06.386
LAST FISCAL YEAR FOR STATE

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:09.089
HOSPITALS FOR GRANT FUNDING FOR.

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:11.124
BEDS OUT IN COMMUNITY OR WHETHER

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:13.693
OR NOT IT'S- US LOOKING TOWARD

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:15.128
SUPPORT OF HOUSING VERSES

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:17.230
PROJECT HOME KEEP. FOR THE

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:18.565
INVESTMENTS THAT WE MADE AS THE

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:20.200
STATE INTO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:24.337
WORKFORCE LPS BY ITSELF. CANNOT

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:26.907
CONNECT PEOPLE TO ONGOING CARE.

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:28.708
IF THAT CARE DOES NOT EXIST

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:30.510
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO MY

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:32.979
QUESTION REALLY IS ABOUT SCOPE

01:47:33.046 --> 01:47:36.149
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT

01:47:36.216 --> 01:47:38.051
THESE INVESTMENTS WILL MEAN FOR

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:40.187
US AS A STATE AND- WHETHER OR

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.121
NOT THEY WILL ADDRESS THIS

01:47:41.188 --> 01:47:43.256
CRISIS HEAD ON OR IF THERE ARE

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:45.025
ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT WE NEED TO

01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:46.059
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS UPCOMING

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.028
YEAR. AND WAS HOPING THE

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:48.995
ADMINISTRATION COULD COMMENT

01:47:49.062 --> 01:47:50.797
REGARDING. BOTH THE STATE

01:47:50.864 --> 01:47:53.066
HOSPITALS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:54.634
THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND THE

01:47:54.701 --> 01:47:56.203
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE.

01:47:56.269 --> 01:47:57.737
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE FUNDING

01:47:57.804 --> 01:47:59.072
STREAMS WERE APPROPRIATE

01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:08.215
SUFFICIENT TO WORK. ANY PLANS. I

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:10.016
CAN TAKE THE FIRST PART OF YOUR

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:13.220
QUESTION. AND I CAN STATE THAT-

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:15.689
THE ADMINISTRATION MADE A- SPOT

01:48:15.755 --> 01:48:17.390
THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENTS

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:19.693
IN. HEBER HEALTH CONTINUED TO

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:20.961
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUED

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.963
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND THE

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:25.398
COMMUNITY CARE INSURANCE- AND

01:48:25.465 --> 01:48:27.234
SO. ARE THE PAYER HEALTH

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.236
CONTINUE- WE RECEIVED TWO POINT

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:31.304
TWO BILLION AND THEN. BURKE

01:48:31.371 --> 01:48:33.340
MEDICARE EXPANSION EIGHT HUNDRED

01:48:33.406 --> 01:48:34.608
MILLION AND- DEPARTMENT

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:35.742
HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS BEEN

01:48:35.809 --> 01:48:37.477
WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:39.212
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO

01:48:39.279 --> 01:48:40.814
A LOT. ABOUT FUNDING WE'RE

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:42.582
ACTUALLY REALLY SAYING. I

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.651
REQUEST REPLICATION IN JANUARY.

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:46.353
FOR ON THE FIRST LARGE PORTION

01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:48.655
OF THAT- AND SO RECOGNIZING

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:51.024
THAT. AS MISS LEWIS STATED WE DO

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:53.159

EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS SPOT. ON

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:56.930
FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO WE ARE

01:48:56.997 --> 01:48:58.665
PUTTING THOSE FUNDS TO GOOD USE

01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:01.635
AND IT REALLY DOES NOT RAPIDLY-

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.470
I CANNOT SPEAK TO THAT. I'M

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:05.005
STATE HOSPITALS BUT I DO JUST

01:49:05.071 --> 01:49:06.573
WANT TO TOUCH ON THE BEHAVIOR

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.808
HEALTH WORKFORCE- AND WHILE

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.710
WE'VE ALREADY HAD STRAINS. TO

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:11.978
THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKFORCE

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:14.281
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- JUST WITH

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:15.682
THE INCREASING COMPLETED

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:17.884
SUICIDES. ON THE RISING OVERDOSE

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:19.886

01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:24.557
STRAINS ON NOT JUST CAPACITY BUT

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:27.060
WORKFORCE. IN RECOGNIZING THAT

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:29.262
THERE'S- A NATIONWIDE WORKFORCE

01:49:29.329 --> 01:49:31.665
ISSUE. BUT WE ARE SEEING THE

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:32.365
IMPACTS OF THOUGHT AND

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:34.000
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THAT AND

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:35.735
WE'RE HEARING A LOT FROM OUR

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.604
LOCALS- OUR PROVIDERS ARE

01:49:37.671 --> 01:49:39.105
COUNTIES ON THAT THEY'RE REALLY

01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:41.608
STRUGGLING- WITH. WORKFORCE AND

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:43.543
IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:46.546
WORKERS- WE WILL- THIS WILL BE A

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:48.181
QUESTION A FOLLOW UP QUESTION

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:50.083
FOR THE AUDITOR BUT WITHIN THE

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:51.685
HAND OUT. RAND CORP HAS

01:49:51.751 --> 01:49:52.652
IDENTIFIED AND I JUST WANT TO

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.321
REMIND US. THAT THE MOST

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:55.956
EXPENSIVE WAY FOR US TO TREAT

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:57.958
OUR LPS POPULATION IS WITHIN

01:49:58.024 --> 01:50:00.093
JAILS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.861
FOR US TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:02.896
THAT WE HAVE THOSE COMMUNITY

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:10.503
SUPPORT. I POINT. US BACK TO THE

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:11.071
AUDITORS FINDINGS WHICH SHOW

01:50:11.137 --> 01:50:11.671
THAT- ONLY NINE PER. OF THOSE

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:13.473
WHO NEEDED ON SO. FOR A TO BE.

01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:14.674
TO THOSE SIR. SO MY QUESTION IS

01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:17.410
WHY WILL THIS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:19.879
INVESTMENTS ALLOW US TO START TO

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.181
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WITHIN THAT

01:50:21.247 --> 01:50:23.350
SPECIFIC METRIC. AS I THINK

01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:25.518
THOSE WHO WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS

01:50:25.585 --> 01:50:27.954
NEEDING- RESOURCES SHOULD THEN

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:29.889
BE CONNECTED TO THOSE RESOURCES

01:50:29.956 --> 01:50:31.157
FOR US TO START MAKING A

01:50:31.224 --> 01:50:33.393
DIFFERENCE WITH THIS POPULATION.

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.096
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AB. THANK

YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:39.366
BRIEF QUESTIONS AND THEN A

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:41.601
COUPLE OF COMMENTS- FIRST OF

01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:45.472
ALL- MISS IT OR OF. YOU GUYS-

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:47.107
YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.309
DATA COLLECTION- WE ALSO KNOW

01:50:49.376 --> 01:50:51.244
THAT COUNTIES ARE NOT DOING THAT

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:53.813
ANYWAY FOR NOT PROVIDING DATA TO

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.549
YOU- WHAT ARE YOU USING THE DATA

01:50:56.616 --> 01:50:58.718
FOR. BECAUSE SOME OF IT ISN'T

01:50:58.785 --> 01:51:01.121
PUBLISHED- BEYOND WAS PUBLISHED

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.856
ON THE WEBSITE WHAT DO YOU USING

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:06.259
THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED FOR-

01:51:06.326 --> 01:51:07.193
IS IT ARE YOU JUST COLLECTING

01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:08.428
THE BECAUSE YOU'RE MANDATED

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:09.996
COLLECTED OR IS THERE A VALUE TO

01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:13.233
IT. THAT ISN'T APPARENT TO US OR

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:15.035
ME ANYWAY- BECAUSE I HAVEN'T I

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:19.039
HAVEN'T SEEN IT. WE DO AND THE

01:51:19.105 --> 01:51:20.407
DATA COLLECTION THAT IS REQUIRED

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:22.609
TO BE PUBLISHED IN PUMP AND WITH

01:51:22.675 --> 01:51:24.744
THE POSTED SO THAT IS ONE ASPECT

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:27.113
OF IT THE OTHER ONE IS THAT WE

01:51:27.180 --> 01:51:29.149
DO COLLECT INFORMATION TO ALSO

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:30.884
REVIEW IF THERE IS ANY NEED FOR

01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:32.485
US TO OPEN UP ANY TYPE OF

01:51:32.552 --> 01:51:34.721
INVESTIGATIONS- BASED OFF OF ANY

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:36.056
DATA RECEIVED THAT THERE MIGHT

01:51:36.122 --> 01:51:36.956
BE ANY PATIENTS RIGHTS

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:38.725
VIOLATIONS AS WELL. SO THAT'S

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.326
INTERNALLY LOOK THAT AGAIN THE

01:51:40.393 --> 01:51:42.262
INFORMATION THAT IS COLLECTED-

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:44.964
IS FOR THAT PURPOSE I'M IS NOT

01:51:45.031 --> 01:51:46.599
REQUIRED TO BE PUBLISHED BY WE

01:51:46.666 --> 01:51:49.769
CAN PROVIDE. INFORMATION OR THAT

01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:52.038
DATA PUBLICLY IF IT'S REQUESTED

01:51:52.105 --> 01:51:53.540
BUT IT HAS TO JUST MAKE SURE WE

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:54.474
ARE MEETING ALL THAT

01:51:54.541 --> 01:51:56.276
CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY.

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:59.412
LAWS UT YOU DON'T BUT COUNTIES

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:00.814
ARE NOT SUBMITTING THE DATA SO

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:01.681
YOU DON'T KNOW THERE MAY BE

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:02.749
PROBLEMS AND SOME OF THESE

01:52:02.816 --> 01:52:03.716
COUNTIES YOU JUST DON'T KNOW

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:04.918
ABOUT THEM BECAUSE ARE NOT

01:52:04.984 --> 01:52:06.086
SUBMITTING DATA AND THEY'RE NOT

01:52:06.152 --> 01:52:07.754
BEING IN ANY WAY FOR NOT

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:11.558
SUBMITTING THE DATA. TWO DATA

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:13.526
SETS INCOMPLETE. REYES SO WE ARE

01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:15.328
FINDING THAT THERE ARE SOME

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.664
DEFICIENCIES ARE THAT WE NEED TO

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.132
IMPROVE THAT SO WE CAN HAVE.

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.366
BETTER DATA COLLECTION AND A

THE L. P. S. ACT- WE'VE GOT

01:55:12.538 --> 01:55:13.706
PEOPLE TO DRAW FUNDING FROM ALL

01:55:13.773 --> 01:55:16.242
OVER THE PLACE- IT JUST DOESN'T

01:55:16.309 --> 01:55:17.710
FEEL LIKE THERE'S KIDS. THAT

01:55:17.777 --> 01:55:18.778
THINGS ARE COORDINATED AND NOW

OVERSIGHT AND THE COUNTIES. SO

01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:08.795
PART OF IT IS INCREASING THE

01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:11.664
COORDINATION BETWEEN OUR TWO-

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:14.701
ENTITIES- FOR REALLY. TO HAVE A

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:16.536

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DEBT

01:56:37.023 --> 01:56:38.658
FACILITIES TO BE DESIGNATED AS

AN LPS FACILITY AND DHS

01:56:40.693 --> 01:56:43.062

APPROPRIATE A WE HAVE AN ACT

01:57:02.315 --> 01:57:04.016
THAT HAS NO DEDICATED FUNDING.

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:05.618
SO WE GOT SOME IS PERPETUALLY

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:08.454
FUELED- A SHIP THAT'S GIVEN FUEL

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:10.823
IT'S FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE-

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.325
NOW NOW YOU SAID THAT YOU KNOW

PARTS OF THIS SO HOW DO WE KNOW

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:26.439
THIS SHIP IS EVEN GOING ANYWHERE

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:28.341
OTHER THAN AND CIRCLE- SKIN

01:57:37.016 --> 01:57:42.655
UNCOORDINATED. RIGHT SO I MEAN I

01:57:42.722 --> 01:57:44.424
THINK I AGREE THAT PART OF WHAT

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.958
WE NEED TO DO IS INCREASE OUR

01:57:46.025 --> 01:57:47.994

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:54.934
OF THIS BUT I. WILL OVERLY AGREE

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:56.436
THAT WE NEED TO AND OUR

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:57.970
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REALLY

GOING TO USE THAT DATA THAT'S

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:11.551
WHAT I'M GETTING AT I DON'T

01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:12.351
YOU'RE GING TO COLLECT DATA

01:58:12.418 --> 01:58:14.520

BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING CHANGES.

01:58:19.492 --> 01:58:21.360
IS THERE AN ENTITY OR IS IT JUST

01:58:21.427 --> 01:58:23.529
IS IT. THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT OF

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.097
HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS AN

01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:26.199
UMBRELLA. I'M JUST STRUGGLING

01:58:26.265 --> 01:58:28.201
TO. COULD THERE BE SOMEBODY IN

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:30.736
CHARGE. I MEAN THAT'S REALLY

01:58:30.803 --> 01:58:36.142
WHAT I'M ASKING. SOMEBODY. I

01:58:36.209 --> 01:58:37.477
JUST WANT TO JUMP IN AND STATE

01:58:37.543 --> 01:58:38.711
WITH WHAT CHANNELS TALKING

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:40.613
ABOUT- WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.949
RESPONSIBLE AROUND THAT DATA

01:58:43.015 --> 01:58:44.450
PIECE OF THE FACILITY TYPES SO

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:45.985
THERE'S DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:48.521
LIKE YOU MENTIONED- THERE'S THE

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:49.655
FACILITY WHERE THE HEALTHCARE

01:58:49.722 --> 01:58:51.190

AN OUTCAST FUNDING SOURCE AND I

01:58:56.863 --> 01:58:58.831
THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE THERE'S

01:58:58.898 --> 01:59:00.533
SOME OF THIS FRAGMENTATION I'M

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.601

ABOUT- YOU CAN USE AN HSA

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:04.804
DOLLARS BUT THERE'S CERTAIN

01:59:04.871 --> 01:59:06.439
THINGS AND WHICH I MAY JUST SAY

01:59:06.506 --> 01:59:07.740
DOLLARS CAN'T BE USED FOR MEDIC

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:09.375
HOW CAN COVER SOME OF IT. BUT

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:11.244
NOT ALL OF IT AND THEN YOU ALSO

01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:13.112
LIKE YOU MENTIONED ON YOUR HAVE

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:14.847

YOU'RE COLLECTING DATA FROM

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:40.039
COUNTIES AND THEN YOU KNOW I'VE

01:59:40.106 --> 01:59:41.741

REALLY HAVE A COORDINATED. WAY

01:59:52.919 --> 01:59:56.923
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACT IS

01:59:56.989 --> 01:59:57.924
. HOW ARE PEOPLE GETTING

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:59.659
SERVICES I MEAN WE WOULDN'T BE

01:59:59.725 --> 02:00:02.495
HERE AT THIS HEARING TODAY IF

02:00:02.562 --> 02:00:03.095

02:00:03.162 --> 02:00:07.433
CLOCK. WE WOULDN'T. IT'S CLEARLY

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:09.335
CLEARLY SOME SOME SERIOUS

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:11.437
SERIOUS CHALLENGES. AND SO I'M

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:12.672
WHAT I'M BEGGING FOR AT SOME

02:00:12.738 --> 02:00:16.208
POINT IS THAT CAN THERE BE SOME

02:00:16.275 --> 02:00:18.578
. IT OPENS HER ST OR ENTITY

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:21.180

WE AND WHERE ARE WE GOING.

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:28.621
CONSIDERING THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS

02:00:28.688 --> 02:00:30.756
OF RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING IN

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:32.592
TO THESE PROGRAMS THE WORST

02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:34.093
THING WE CAN DO IS CONTINUE TO

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:36.862
PUT MONEY INTO A SYSTEM. THAT

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:39.265
ISN'T BEING EFFECTIVE. WITHOUT

TRYING TO CHANGE CHANGE AND

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:42.768
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AND THAT'S

02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:44.837
KIND OF WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. IS

02:00:44.904 --> 02:00:46.906
THAT WE HEAR FROM OUR

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:47.473
CONSTITUENTS CONSTANTLY THIS

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:50.610

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DAY I

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:08.407
TRIED TO KILL MYSELF FOLLOWING A

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:10.142
SEXUAL ASSAULT. WHEN I WAS

02:04:10.209 --> 02:04:12.044
INVOLUNTARILY COMMITTED I WAS

02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:13.946
TREATED LIKE A BURDEN AND I WAS

02:04:14.013 --> 02:04:15.848
TOLD. NOT TO LET MYSELF GET

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:18.584
RAPED AGAIN. AS A BLACK WOMAN I

02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:20.486
ALWAYS HAVE TO CONSIDER THE ROLE

02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:22.721
THE HISTORICAL RACISM PLAYS AND

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:24.757
MY TREATMENT AND CARE. AT THE

02:04:24.824 --> 02:04:26.859
HOSPITAL I EXPERIENCED CHEMICAL

02:04:26.926 --> 02:04:29.261
RESTRAINTS AND VERBAL ABUSE AND

02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:31.764
THE TREATMENT MODALITY. IT WAS

02:04:31.831 --> 02:04:32.698
COLORING AND WATCHING SILENCE OF

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:35.367
THE LAMBS THERE IS NO THERAPY NO%

02:04:35.434 --> 02:04:37.102
DIGNITY AND CERTAINLY NO CURE

02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:39.004
SUPPORT. WE WERE TOLD WHEN TO

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:41.073
WAKE UP WHAT TO EAT WHAT

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:43.008
MEDICATION TO TAKE. THERE IS NO

02:04:43.075 --> 02:04:45.911
CHOICE. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I

02:04:45.978 --> 02:04:47.780
HAD A MENTAL ILLNESS I WOULD

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:49.648
NEVER WORK IN A RELATIONSHIP OR

02:04:49.715 --> 02:04:51.584
HAVE A FILLING LIFE. AND I KNOW

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:52.718
THIS IS NOT WHAT MY MOTHER

02:04:52.785 --> 02:04:54.119
ENVISIONED FOR ME WHEN SHE WAS

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:56.522
TRYING TO GET ME HELP. MY STORY

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:58.724
IS NOT RARE IT IS NOT UNIQUE. A

02:04:58.791 --> 02:04:59.992
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:01.227
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE SOMEONE

02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:02.695
MAKE LL OF YOUR DECISIONS FOR

02:05:02.761 --> 02:05:05.130
YOU TAKE AWAY YOUR AGENCY AND

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:06.232
LOOK AT YOU LIKE YOU WERE BROKEN

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:08.033
CHILD. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO

02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:10.402
BE SENT AWAY. THE SPACE TO HEAL

02:05:10.469 --> 02:05:12.004
WASN'T HEALING IT WAS

02:05:12.071 --> 02:05:14.373
OVERCROWDED AND CHAOTIC AND THEN

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:16.275
I WAS RELEASED NO FOLLOW UP NO

02:05:16.342 --> 02:05:18.844
AFTER CARE NO SUPPORT OF

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:19.411
LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY BASED

02:05:19.478 --> 02:05:20.946
PROGRAMS. SO THE CURRENT

02:05:21.013 --> 02:05:23.048
TREATMENT IS TRAUMATIC WHY WOULD

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:25.117
WE EXPAND WHAT TRAUMA RECEIVED

02:05:25.184 --> 02:05:26.418
FROM INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT TAKES

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:28.687
TIME TO RECOVER FROM AND I TRULY

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:30.089
BELIEVE OUR COLLECTIVE INTENTION

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:32.124
IS NOT TO SUBJECT PEOPLE TO

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:33.726
TRAUMA BY OVER TAX SYSTEMS.

02:05:33.792 --> 02:05:35.427
PEOPLE DESERVE AND NEED

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:37.930
VOLUNTARY OPTIONS WAS ACTUALLY

02:05:37.997 --> 02:05:40.232
HELPFUL PURE SUPPORT. VOLUNTARY

02:05:40.299 --> 02:05:41.834
TRAUMA INFORMED THERAPY AND A

02:05:41.901 --> 02:05:42.968
SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY THAT

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:44.637
BELIEVES THAT PEOPLE CAN AND DO

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:46.639
RECOVER. EVERYONE DESERVES

02:05:46.705 --> 02:05:48.307
ACCESS TO THESE TYPES OF ROBUST

02:05:48.374 --> 02:05:49.875
EVIDENCE BASED SERVICES AND

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:51.510
CULTURE RESPONSIVE PROGRAMMING

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:55.981
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT STAY

02:05:56.048 --> 02:05:56.548
CONNECTED WITH THEM AND JUST

02:05:56.615 --> 02:05:57.182
FOLLOW UP. IN THE STATE BECAUSE

02:05:57.249 --> 02:05:59.118
THOSE LONG PSYCHE. HOSPITALS WE

02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:01.053
WERE. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.821
THE COMMUNITY AND THAT IS A

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:04.723
PROMISE THAT HAS NOT BEEN BUILT.

02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:06.091
WE CANNOT LOOK AT LPS

02:06:06.158 --> 02:06:08.494
CONSERVATORSHIP WITHOUT LOOKING

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.094
AT THE LARGER MENTAL HEALTH

02:06:09.161 --> 02:06:11.363
SYSTEM. EXERCISING THAT MUCH

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.065
CONTROL OVER SOMEONE'S EMOTIONAL

02:06:13.132 --> 02:06:15.334
AND BODILY AUTONOMY IS REALLY

02:06:15.401 --> 02:06:16.802
JUST A WAY NOT TO LOOK AT.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:19.138
CONTEXT IN A SIDE STEP SOLVING

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:21.106
THE PROBLEMS THAT CREATE

02:06:21.173 --> 02:06:22.975
SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION AND TRAUMA.

02:06:23.042 --> 02:06:24.276
I THINK WE TEND TO WANT TO

02:06:24.343 --> 02:06:26.045

02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:52.610
THOSE. AND THEN WE ALSO LOOKED

02:20:52.677 --> 02:20:55.079
AT CASES WHERE THE DETERMINATION

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:56.681
WAS THIS INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:58.183
NEED TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD WE

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.484
WANT TO LOOK AT ALL DIFFERENT

02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:01.352
ASPECTS. AND AS HAS BEEN

02:21:01.419 --> 02:21:03.488
DISCUSSED. PREVIOUSLY BY SOME OF

02:21:03.555 --> 02:21:04.689
THE OTHER PANELISTS WHEN WE LOOK

02:21:04.756 --> 02:21:06.090
AT THE CRITERIA WE DIDN'T SEE

02:21:06.157 --> 02:21:07.192
SIGNIFICANT KINDS

02:21:07.258 --> 02:21:09.661
INCONSISTENCIES. IN THE

02:21:09.727 --> 02:21:11.196
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MAKING THESE

02:21:11.262 --> 02:21:12.564
DETERMINATIONS AT EACH OF THE

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:15.300
COUNTIES SOME HAD- SHASTA COUNTY

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:17.368
PARTICULAR HAD MORE SPECIFIC

02:21:17.435 --> 02:21:19.103
GUIDANCE FOR THEIR INDIVIDUALS.

02:21:19.170 --> 02:21:20.438
WHO ARE MAKING THESE DECISIONS

02:21:20.505 --> 02:21:21.472
BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T SEE A LOT

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:23.474
OF INCONSISTENCY SO WE DID REACH

02:21:23.541 --> 02:21:25.443
THE CONCLUSION THAT. WE DIDN'T

02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:27.745
FEEL THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE ANY

02:21:27.812 --> 02:21:29.948
REVISIONS TO THE CRITERIA. IN

02:21:30.014 --> 02:21:31.749
THE LETTERMAN PETROUS ACT WITH

02:21:31.816 --> 02:21:34.018
RESPECT INVOLUNTARY HOLDS SO WE

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:37.255
REACH THAT CONCLUSION WE DID NOT

02:21:37.322 --> 02:21:37.856
HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH

02:21:37.922 --> 02:21:40.258
RESPECT TO THAT. SO MOVING ON TO

02:21:40.325 --> 02:21:41.459
IF YOU MAKE A DETERMINATION

02:21:41.526 --> 02:21:43.094
SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE PLACED IN AN

02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:45.196
INVOLUNTARY HOLDS. LOOKING AT

02:21:45.263 --> 02:21:47.432
CAPACITY BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:21:47.498 --> 02:21:48.666
AND THE LOCAL LEVEL THE THREE

02:21:48.733 --> 02:21:50.735
COUNTIES I MENTIONED. AS TO THE

02:21:50.802 --> 02:21:52.070
ABILITY FOR THE STATE OF

02:21:52.136 --> 02:21:52.871
CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR STATE

02:21:52.937 --> 02:21:55.306
HOSPITALS. TO PROVIDE BED SPACE

02:21:55.373 --> 02:21:57.642
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED

02:21:57.709 --> 02:21:59.744
INTENSIVE INPATIENT TREATMENT.

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:01.212
AND WHAT WE FOUND IS IN LOOKING

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:03.314
AT STATE HOSPITALS BECAUSE THOSE

02:22:03.381 --> 02:22:05.183
STATE HOSPITALS ARE REALLY HAVE

02:22:05.250 --> 02:22:07.952
A LEGAL OBLIGATION. TO PROVIDE

02:22:08.019 --> 02:22:10.288
BEDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:11.890
BEEN DETERMINED AND COMPETENT TO

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:14.893
STAND TRIAL. MAJORITY OF THE BED

02:22:14.959 --> 02:22:16.728
SPACE IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS. IS

02:22:16.794 --> 02:22:18.296
TAKEN UP BY THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:20.064
WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT.

02:22:20.131 --> 02:22:22.734
WE'RE LOOKING AT FISCAL YEAR

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:25.103
181985% OF THE BEDS. IN THE

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.704
STATE HOSPITAL WERE WERE.

02:22:26.771 --> 02:22:28.606
OCCUPIED BY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:22:28.673 --> 02:22:30.575
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL SO

02:22:30.642 --> 02:22:32.310
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT THAT MEANS IS

02:22:32.377 --> 02:22:34.746
INDIVIDUALS- DETERMINED THAT

02:22:34.812 --> 02:22:36.314
NEED THAT ASSISTANCE FROM THE

02:22:36.381 --> 02:22:38.750
STATE HOSPITAL. BECAUSE OF

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:40.551
LETTERMAN ACT. ARE WAITING FOR A

02:22:40.618 --> 02:22:42.887
LONG TIME TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE

02:22:42.954 --> 02:22:45.089
BEDS. ON AVERAGE WE DETERMINED

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:46.691
THERE WAITING AT LEAST A YEAR ON

02:22:46.758 --> 02:22:49.027
AVERAGE TO GET A BET. ON IN SOME

02:22:49.093 --> 02:22:50.795
CASES IT WAS LONGER THAN THAT

02:22:50.862 --> 02:22:51.396
SOME OF THE EXAMPLES WE LOOKED

02:22:51.462 --> 02:22:53.998
AT. SO ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:22:54.065 --> 02:22:55.833
WHAT ARE THEY FACED WITH WEALTH

02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:56.801
WHICH WE TRY TO PROVIDE AS A

02:22:56.868 --> 02:22:59.570
STATE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DO WE

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:00.405
HAVE BED SPACE AT THE LOCAL

02:23:00.471 --> 02:23:02.440
LEVEL. AND THEN LOOKING AT LOS

02:23:02.507 --> 02:23:03.975
ANGELES AGAIN SAN FRANCISCO IN

02:23:04.042 --> 02:23:05.810
SHASTA WE ASK THEM WHAT KIND OF

02:23:05.877 --> 02:23:07.845
CAPACITY DO YOU HAVE. AND

02:23:07.912 --> 02:23:09.047
CONSISTENTLY THEY'RE SAYING WE

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:10.882
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO

02:23:10.949 --> 02:23:12.183
PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE

02:23:12.250 --> 02:23:14.686
INDIVIDUALS. WHEN WE ASKED EACH

02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:16.955
OF THE THREE COUNTIES. DO YOU DO

02:23:17.021 --> 02:23:20.024
AN ANALYSIS OF. HOW MUCH YOU

02:23:20.091 --> 02:23:22.193
KNOW THE NEED FOR BED SPACE. LOS

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.728
ANGELES HAD A VERY ROBUST

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:25.363
PROCESS WE DESCRIBED IN THE

02:23:25.430 --> 02:23:27.165
REPORT. AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:29.133
DONE AN ANALYSIS IN OCTOBER OF

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.235
TWENTY NINETEEN. INDICATING THAT

02:23:31.302 --> 02:23:33.204
THEY NEEDED APPROXIMATELY

02:23:33.271 --> 02:23:34.772
FIFTEEN HUNDRED ADDITIONAL BEDS.

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:35.907
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE

02:23:35.974 --> 02:23:40.345
SERVICES INPATIENT SERVICES. FOR

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:41.346
INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP. ON

02:23:41.412 --> 02:23:43.314
SEPARATIST GO HAD NOT DONE THAT

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:45.717
TYPE OF ANALYSIS SHASTA WAS VERY

02:23:45.783 --> 02:23:47.852
SMALL SO ON A MONTHLY BASIS THEY

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:50.455
WOULD COMMUNICATE- WITHIN THEIR

02:23:50.521 --> 02:23:51.956
COMMUNITY AND WOULD UNDERSTAND

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:53.625
HOW HOW IF THERE WERE

02:23:53.691 --> 02:23:55.560
INDIVIDUALS WAITING FOR A BED-

02:23:55.626 --> 02:23:56.794
BUT A SMALL COUNTY WE REALLY

02:23:56.861 --> 02:23:57.962
WANT TO LOOK AT A SMALL COUNTY

02:23:58.029 --> 02:23:59.030
BUT LOS ANGELES HAD A VERY

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.531
ROBUST PROCESS SO THAT COULD BE

02:24:00.598 --> 02:24:02.000
CERTAINLY BE USED AS A MODEL FOR

02:24:02.066 --> 02:24:03.634
OTHER COUNTIES. TO DETERMINE HOW

02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:06.804
MANY. BEDS ARE REALLY NEEDED FOR

02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:09.240
THESE INDIVIDUALS. SO ONE OF THE

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:10.775
RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD IS TO

02:24:10.842 --> 02:24:12.110
REQUIRE STATE HOSPITALS TO

02:24:12.176 --> 02:24:14.679
REPORT. AND WAS BY APRIL OF

02:24:14.746 --> 02:24:15.646
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE SHOULD JUST

02:24:15.713 --> 02:24:16.748
REPORT IN JULY AND AS YOU KNOW

02:24:16.814 --> 02:24:19.150
MEMBERS. IN OUR REPORTS NOW WE

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:22.086
SPECIFIED TIME FRAME- TO.

02:24:22.153 --> 02:24:23.488
AGENCIES TO YOU NEED TO

02:24:23.554 --> 02:24:25.289
ACCOMPLISH THIS BY THIS DATE AND

02:24:25.356 --> 02:24:26.724
AT THAT POINT IN TIME WE SAID

02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:27.825
APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO

02:24:27.892 --> 02:24:29.460
IDENTIFY. HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST

02:24:29.527 --> 02:24:30.728
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:24:30.795 --> 02:24:32.563
EITHER IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL.

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.465
FACILITIES THAT COULD BE USED AS

02:24:34.532 --> 02:24:36.134
STATE HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE EDS

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:38.236
FOR. YOU KNOW THE INCOMPETENT TO

02:24:38.302 --> 02:24:39.737
STANDTRIAL BUT CERTAINLY THE

02:24:39.804 --> 02:24:42.573
LPS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NEEDING

02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:44.375
THAT INTENSIVE AN INPATIENT

02:24:44.442 --> 02:24:46.878
TREATMENT. SO THAT WAS ONE OF

02:24:46.944 --> 02:24:47.912
THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE

02:24:47.979 --> 02:24:49.947
STATE. WE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT

02:24:50.014 --> 02:24:54.919
THE COUNTIES. DEVELOP WAYS TO-

02:24:54.986 --> 02:24:56.187
DECIDE OR DETERMINE HOW MANY

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:58.056
BEDS THEY ACTUALLY NEED NOT ONLY

02:24:58.122 --> 02:24:59.524
CURRENTLY BUT IN THE FUTURE TRY

02:24:59.590 --> 02:25:00.858
TO ASSESS TRY TO PROJECT YOUR

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:02.427
NEEDS AND AGAIN LOS ANGELES

02:25:02.493 --> 02:25:04.228
COUNTY I HAVE TO SAY. AND

02:25:04.295 --> 02:25:05.196
BREEDING REPORT AGAIN THIS

02:25:05.263 --> 02:25:06.497
WEEKEND REALLY DID HAVE A READ

02:25:06.564 --> 02:25:08.199
ROBUST PROCESS TO DO THAT

02:25:08.266 --> 02:25:11.102
ANALYSIS. SO WE THINK THAT NEEDS

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:13.838
TO HAPPEN. SO NOW IF SOMEONE

02:25:13.905 --> 02:25:16.941
DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A- BED AT

02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:17.909
THE STATE LEVEL DOESN'T HAVE

02:25:17.975 --> 02:25:19.243
ACCESS TO A BED AT THE LOCAL

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:21.479
LEVEL FOR INTENSIVE CARE. WHAT

02:25:21.546 --> 02:25:23.381
HAPPENS TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND

02:25:23.448 --> 02:25:24.115
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:25:24.182 --> 02:25:25.383
IDENTIFIED WHEN WE WERE

02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:27.285
CONDUCTING THE WORK IS. PEOPLE

02:25:27.351 --> 02:25:28.820
AS YOU I'M SURE HAVE HEARD OUR

02:25:28.886 --> 02:25:31.923
CYCLING THEIR CYCLING IN CRISIS

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:33.825
THEY'RE IN A IN A SEVENTY TWO

02:25:33.891 --> 02:25:35.626
HOUR HOLD THEIR RELEASED.

02:25:35.693 --> 02:25:37.095
THERE'S NO BED SPACE AVAILABLE

02:25:37.161 --> 02:25:38.296
FOR THEM PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE

02:25:38.362 --> 02:25:39.864
THEM IN AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:40.965
TREATMENT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:42.366
IN A MINUTE. BUT WHAT WE WERE

02:25:42.433 --> 02:25:45.269
SEEING IS A LOT OF. INDIVIDUALS

02:25:45.336 --> 02:25:46.971
CONSISTENTLY CYCLING BECAUSE

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:47.805
THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE

02:25:47.872 --> 02:25:49.474
TREATMENT THEY NEED EITHER AN

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.876
INPATIENT. A SITUATION OR

02:25:51.943 --> 02:25:56.814
SCENARIO. OR THROUGH ASSISTED

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:58.049
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. SOMEONE

02:25:58.116 --> 02:26:00.485
TALKING TO THE COUNTIES WHAT WHY

02:26:00.551 --> 02:26:01.619
AREN'T YOU ABLE TO NOT JUST THE

02:26:01.686 --> 02:26:02.954
BED SPACE BUT WHY AREN'T YOU

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.722
ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO

02:26:04.789 --> 02:26:06.057
THESE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. AND

02:26:06.124 --> 02:26:07.225
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF GAPS THAT

02:26:07.291 --> 02:26:08.726
WERE IDENTIFIED MANY OF THE

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:10.828
COUNTIES INDICATED TO US. WE

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:12.096
DON'T EVEN KNOW ALL OF THE

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:14.432
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CYCLING

02:26:14.499 --> 02:26:15.533
THROUGH EITHER SEVENTY TWO HOUR

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:17.635
HOLD. OR PERHAPS A FOURTEEN DAY

02:26:17.702 --> 02:26:21.172
HOLD. SO WHAT WE DID IS WE DID

02:26:21.239 --> 02:26:22.874
AN ANALYSIS WE HAD ACCESS TO

02:26:22.940 --> 02:26:24.909
DATA. THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:26.677
DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO WHICH IS

02:26:26.744 --> 02:26:28.613
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE'VE

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:30.281
DONE A LOT OF SAYS YOU KNOW OF

02:26:30.348 --> 02:26:31.716
ARMED PROHIBITED PERSONS IN FACT

02:26:31.782 --> 02:26:34.051
MR HARRIS WAS THE MANAGER ON

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:35.653
THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT. WHERE

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:36.988
MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES ARE

02:26:37.054 --> 02:26:39.223
REQUIRED TO REPORT TO JUSTICE AN

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:41.392
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS PLACED ON A-

02:26:41.459 --> 02:26:42.994
FIFTY ONE FIFTY. THIS PERSON

02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:44.795
SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO.

02:26:44.862 --> 02:26:46.831
HAVING A WEAPON BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:26:46.898 --> 02:26:48.666
DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS. SO

02:26:48.733 --> 02:26:50.034
WHEN USING THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:26:50.101 --> 02:26:52.703
JUSTICE DATA. WE IDENTIFIED FOR

02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:56.440
SOME OF THESE COUNTIES YOU HAVE.

02:26:56.507 --> 02:26:57.108
SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE

02:26:57.175 --> 02:26:59.477
PLACED ON AT LEAST. FIVE OR MORE

02:26:59.544 --> 02:27:01.312
HOLD OVER A TWO OR THREE YEAR

02:27:01.379 --> 02:27:02.280
WINDOW THIS IS FOR LOS ANGELES

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:04.115
COUNTY. SO WE SAID HOW MANY OF

02:27:04.182 --> 02:27:05.550
THOSE INDIVIDUALS THEY COULDN'T

02:27:05.616 --> 02:27:07.451
GET A BED. HOW MANY OF THOSE

02:27:07.518 --> 02:27:08.920
INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY GOT ACCESS

02:27:08.986 --> 02:27:11.088
TO. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

02:27:11.155 --> 02:27:13.658
TREATMENT A REALLY GOOD TYPE OF

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:16.327
TREATMENT. IT WAS TWO TWO OUT OF

02:27:16.394 --> 02:27:18.829
TWENTY SOURCE ABOUT TEN PERCENT.

02:27:18.896 --> 02:27:20.331
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE

02:27:20.398 --> 02:27:21.866
GETTING THAT KIND OF CARE SO

02:27:21.933 --> 02:27:23.267
AGAIN THOSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:24.802
NOT GETTING THAT KIND OF CARE.

02:27:24.869 --> 02:27:26.971
AGAIN ARE GOING FROM. CRISIS

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:28.706
MODE TO CRISIS MODE TO PRICES

02:27:28.773 --> 02:27:29.774
MOTHER NOT GETTING THE TREATMENT

THEY NEED. WE LOOK TO SAN

02:27:31.242 --> 02:27:33.277
FRANCISCO IT WAS EVEN WORSE IT

02:27:33.344 --> 02:27:34.946
WAS ONE OUT OF TWENTY

02:27:35.012 --> 02:27:36.881
INDIVIDUALS. SO WHAT WE

02:27:36.948 --> 02:27:38.282
DETERMINED IS A THIS IS

02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:40.351

02:27:40.418 --> 02:27:42.486
NEEDS THE COUNTY NEEDS THIS TYPE

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:43.754
OF INFORMATION SO WE DID MAKE

02:27:43.821 --> 02:27:45.656
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. TO THE

02:27:45.723 --> 02:27:47.658
LEGISLATURE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE

02:27:47.725 --> 02:27:49.427
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO

02:27:49.493 --> 02:27:51.829
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. TO THE

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:52.997
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:55.833
SO HEALTHCARE SERVICES WOULD

02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:56.934
HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT IS.

02:27:57.001 --> 02:27:58.769
ALREADY STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO

02:28:00.938 --> 02:28:02.173
THAT INFORMATION TO HEALTH CARE

02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:04.141
SERVICES SO HEALTHCARE SERVICES

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:06.644
CAN LOOK AT. THAT INFORMATION

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:08.312
AND SHARE IT WITH THE COUNTIES

02:28:12.850 --> 02:28:13.384
FIFTY WERE REPORTED TO US THEY

02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:16.153
CANNOT. HAVE A WEAPON BECAUSE

02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:17.088
THEY ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES

02:28:17.154 --> 02:28:18.789

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:26.864
RECOMMENDATION. THAT JUSTICE BE

02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:28.099
ABLE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION

02:28:28.165 --> 02:28:29.567
HEALTHCARE SERVICES. HEALTHCARE

02:28:29.634 --> 02:28:31.802
SERVICES USE THAT INFORMATION

02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:33.838
AND WORK WITH THE LOCALS. THE

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:36.007
COUNTIES- DEPARTMENT SO THAT

02:28:36.073 --> 02:28:36.741
THEY UNDERSTAND YOU THE

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:38.209
RESIDENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

02:28:38.276 --> 02:28:39.844
THAT NEED THIS KIND OF CARE SO

02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:41.779
THAT THEY HOPEFULLY CAN. WORK

02:28:41.846 --> 02:28:43.214
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND GET

02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:44.649
THEM TO THE ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:45.716

THE CARE THEY NEED SO THEY STOP

02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:51.756
CYCLING. SO SOME KEY

02:28:51.822 --> 02:28:54.292
RECOMMENDATIONS THERE SO THEN WE

02:28:54.358 --> 02:28:55.626
SAID OKAY WELL LET'S LOOK AT

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:57.361
ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:59.130
HOW EFFECTIVE IS THAT WHAT'S

02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:00.498
BEEN PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE

02:29:00.564 --> 02:29:01.332
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF

02:29:01.399 --> 02:29:03.267
THAT. WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE

02:29:03.334 --> 02:29:05.670
AUDIT WHAT WE DETERMINED IS AS

02:29:05.736 --> 02:29:07.738
YOU KNOW THAT ASSISTED

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:08.939
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS A

02:29:09.006 --> 02:29:10.007
VOLUNTARY COUNTIES CAN

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.976
VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN THAT

02:29:12.043 --> 02:29:12.877
AT THE TIME WE CONDUCTED THE

02:29:12.943 --> 02:29:14.945
AUDIT AND AT THAT TIME YOU'RE

02:29:15.012 --> 02:29:16.080
ONLY NINETEEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT

02:29:16.147 --> 02:29:17.581
COUNTIES THAT WERE USING

02:29:17.648 --> 02:29:19.684
ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:22.053
THAT REALLY EMBRACED IT. WE ALSO

02:29:22.119 --> 02:29:23.821
IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE

02:29:23.888 --> 02:29:26.157
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS- WITHIN

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:28.326
THE LETERMAN ACT. THAT LIMITED

02:29:28.392 --> 02:29:29.727
PEOPLE AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES-

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:32.930
IS EGGMAN'S BILL CORRECTED. IS

02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:34.065
THAT AND WE FOUND THAT

02:29:34.131 --> 02:29:35.032
INDIVIDUALS COMING OFF OF

02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:36.834
CONSERVATORSHIP. THEY'RE DOING

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:38.736
BETTER THEY DIDN'T EVEN QUALIFY

02:29:38.803 --> 02:29:39.637
FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

02:29:39.704 --> 02:29:40.838
TREATMENT BECAUSE YOU HAD TO

02:29:40.905 --> 02:29:42.440
HAVE. YOU KNOW YOUR CONDITION

02:29:42.506 --> 02:29:44.041
HAD TO BE DEGRADING. HER

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:46.577
LEGISLATION FIX THAT SO I THINK

02:29:46.644 --> 02:29:48.779
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT.

02:29:48.846 --> 02:29:50.581
IN THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THIS

02:29:50.648 --> 02:29:53.684
ASSISTANT OUTPATIENT TREATMENT.

02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:54.885
TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING

02:29:54.952 --> 02:29:56.554
OFF OF CONSERVATORSHIP BECAUSE

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.456
WHAT WE FOUND IS OF SIXTY

02:29:58.522 --> 02:30:00.691
CONSERVATORSHIP. EIGHTEEN OF

02:30:00.758 --> 02:30:02.326
THOSE INDIVIDUALS ENDED UP

02:30:02.393 --> 02:30:04.061
COMING OFF OF CONSERVATORSHIP.

02:30:04.128 --> 02:30:05.096
COULDN'T GET THAT ASSISTED

02:30:05.162 --> 02:30:06.831
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT AT SYSTEM

02:30:06.897 --> 02:30:08.599
CONTINUOUS CARE. WENT BACK INTO

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:10.401
CRISIS MODE WENT BACK INTO

02:30:10.468 --> 02:30:13.604
CONSERVATORSHIP. A LONGER CYCLE

02:30:13.671 --> 02:30:16.240
BUT STILL CYCLING- SO WE BELIEVE

02:30:16.307 --> 02:30:18.209
THAT THAT LEGISLATION CERTAINLY

02:30:18.275 --> 02:30:20.745
HAS HAS MADE AN IMPROVEMENT.

02:30:20.811 --> 02:30:23.214
ANOTHER AREA RELATED TO CRITERIA

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:24.482
UNDER THE LANHAM AND PEPPERS-

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:26.751
SHORT ACT IS THE COURT ORDERED

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:29.286
MEDICATION- THIS IS ANOTHER

02:30:29.353 --> 02:30:32.089
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MADE IS

02:30:32.156 --> 02:30:33.424
TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE EXPRESS A

02:30:33.491 --> 02:30:35.526
STORY TO INCLUDE MEDICATION

02:30:35.593 --> 02:30:37.561
REQUIREMENTS IN COURT ORDERED.

02:30:37.628 --> 02:30:38.763
ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT

02:30:38.829 --> 02:30:40.564
PLANTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:30:40.631 --> 02:30:43.367
HAS. IS AUTHORIZED IN OTHER

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:44.468
STATES I THINK WE IDENTIFIED

02:30:44.535 --> 02:30:45.770
ABOUT TWELVE OTHER STATES THAT

02:30:45.836 --> 02:30:47.438
ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR THIS AND IT

02:30:47.505 --> 02:30:49.740
REALLY DOES HELP BECAUSE IT IT

02:30:49.807 --> 02:30:51.375
REALLY ENCOURAGES AND IT'S A WAY

02:30:51.442 --> 02:30:53.177
TO GET PEOPLE TO. THEIR

02:30:53.244 --> 02:30:54.145
PARTICIPATING IN ASSISTED

02:30:54.211 --> 02:30:56.113
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IT'S A

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:57.481
LEAST LESS RESTRICTIVE

02:30:57.548 --> 02:30:59.417
ENVIRONMENT THAN INPATIENT. IT'S

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:00.918
GOING TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUAL

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.286
STAY ON THEIR MEDICATION AS WE

02:31:02.353 --> 02:31:03.721
DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT REPORT

02:31:03.788 --> 02:31:06.290
MANY PEOPLE WHO RIVER RIVER

02:31:06.357 --> 02:31:08.692
TENANTS BAD WORD BUT CYCLE BACK

02:31:08.759 --> 02:31:09.960
IT'S BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER TAKE

02:31:10.027 --> 02:31:11.729
THEIR TO THEIR MEDICATION. OR

02:31:11.796 --> 02:31:13.497
THEY THEIR ILLNESSES SUCH THAT

02:31:13.564 --> 02:31:14.565
THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT THAT

02:31:14.632 --> 02:31:16.734
MEDICATION IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:19.303
TO AVOID ENDING UP ON A- SEVENTY

02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:20.671
TWO HOUR HOLD ENDING UP IN IN

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:25.509
PATIENT- TREATMENT SO. WE MADE

02:31:25.576 --> 02:31:26.143
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO

02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:28.979
THAT- AS FAR AS THE YOU KNOW

02:31:29.046 --> 02:31:29.547
NINETEEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:31.849
COUNTY'S AGAIN. MS EGGMAN'S BILL

02:31:31.916 --> 02:31:35.719
AS FAR AS- OF REQUIRING COUNTIES

02:31:35.786 --> 02:31:37.121
TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY PUBLICLY

02:31:37.188 --> 02:31:39.690
OPT OUT OF USING ASSISTED

02:31:39.757 --> 02:31:41.492
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. PUT SOME

02:31:41.559 --> 02:31:43.360
PRESSURE ON SOME COUNTIES QUITE

02:31:43.427 --> 02:31:45.496
FRANKLY AND NOW INSTEAD OF

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:46.697
NINETEEN COUNTIES WE HAVE THIRTY

02:31:46.764 --> 02:31:49.667
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE

02:31:49.733 --> 02:31:51.235
USING ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:53.204
TREATMENT AND THAT'S BASED ON

02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:55.272
YOU KNOW RESEARCHERS EXPERTS NOT

02:31:55.339 --> 02:31:56.674
AUDITORS THIS IS A VERY

02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.542
EFFECTIVE TYPE OF TREATMENT NOW

02:31:58.609 --> 02:32:00.578
IF WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GET THE-

02:32:00.644 --> 02:32:02.780
THE OTHER. THE RECOMMENDATION WE

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:04.081
MADE TO PROVIDE EXPRESSIVE

02:32:04.148 --> 02:32:06.250
SORTIE TO INCLUDE MEDICATION

02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:08.152
REQUIREMENTS AND COURT ORDERED

02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:09.520
TO A TREATMENT PLANT THAT'S WHAT

02:32:09.587 --> 02:32:10.321
I THINK GOING TO MAKE THOSE

02:32:10.387 --> 02:32:12.690
PROGRAMS EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE SO

02:32:12.756 --> 02:32:13.491
THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE

02:32:13.557 --> 02:32:16.927
CONTINUE. TO EMBRACE AND SUGGEST

02:32:16.994 --> 02:32:19.430
TO THE LEGISLATURE. SO THOSE ARE

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:20.731
THE KEY ISSUES RELATED TO

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:22.967
ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT.

02:32:23.033 --> 02:32:24.335
AND THE LAST THING AND THIS A

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:25.536
DOCTOR WHAT I THINK WILL TIE

02:32:25.603 --> 02:32:26.804
INTO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:28.239
HAD FOR PREVIOUS YOUR SOME OF

02:32:28.305 --> 02:32:30.508
YOUR FRUSTRATIONS. OR AUDITORS

02:32:30.574 --> 02:32:32.643
WE WANT TO KNOW. THERE'S A LOT

02:32:32.710 --> 02:32:34.011
OF FUNDING HERE'S WHEN WE

02:32:34.078 --> 02:32:34.979
CONDUCTED THE AUDIT THERE WAS

02:32:35.045 --> 02:32:36.347
ABOUT CLOSE TO EIGHT BILLION

02:32:36.413 --> 02:32:37.948
DOLLARS BEING INVESTED. AND

02:32:38.015 --> 02:32:39.884
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN

02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:40.417
CALIFORNIA EITHER THROUGH

02:32:40.484 --> 02:32:42.119
REALIGNMENT MONEY. MEDI CAL

02:32:42.186 --> 02:32:44.388
MONEY M. HSA MONEY BUT THERE

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:45.756
REALLY ISN'T A COMPREHENSIVE

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.491
FRAMEWORK IT'S VERY DISJOINTED

02:32:47.558 --> 02:32:49.326
AS WE SAY IN THE REPORT. THERE

02:32:49.393 --> 02:32:50.561
ARE DIFFERENT TOOLS DIFFERENT

02:32:50.628 --> 02:32:53.197
REPORTING MECHANISMS BUT THERE

02:32:53.264 --> 02:32:54.565
ISN'T AN OVER ARCHING.

02:32:54.632 --> 02:32:58.235
COMPREHENSIVE CLEAR VIEW OF THE

02:32:58.302 --> 02:33:01.305
INVESTMENT CALIFORNIA MAKES IN

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:03.073
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NOW

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:03.674
CERTAINLY THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:33:03.741 --> 02:33:05.409
SERVICES ACT IS TERRIFIC FOR

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.845
CALIFORNIA THERE ARE CATEGORIES

02:33:07.912 --> 02:33:09.713
THAT ARE COUNTIES HER MENTAL

COMMISSION HAS THOSE CATEGORIES

02:33:19.356 --> 02:33:21.191
OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT PREVENTION

02:33:21.258 --> 02:33:23.594
EARLY INTERVENTION INNOVATION AT

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:24.862
CETERA ETCETERAAND WE'VE DONE A

02:33:24.929 --> 02:33:26.163
LOT OF TIME THAT AND AS MR

02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:28.666
SANTIAGO MENTIONED EARLIER WE'VE

02:33:28.732 --> 02:33:30.267
IDENTIFIED ON SPENT MONEY WE

02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:31.535
TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS AUDIT

02:33:31.602 --> 02:33:33.003
REPORT LOS ANGELES COUNTY

02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:35.205
JUSTIN. PREVENTION AND EARLY

02:33:35.272 --> 02:33:36.774

EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HAD CLOSE TO

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:40.377
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:33:40.444 --> 02:33:41.979
UNSPENT FUNDS AND THAT'S

02:33:42.046 --> 02:33:43.914
SEPARATE FROM THE RESERVE THAT

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.716
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HOLD ON TO SO

02:33:45.783 --> 02:33:47.585
THERE IS MONEY AVAILABLE OUT

02:33:47.651 --> 02:33:50.387
THERE SO WHAT WE DID IS WHEN WE

02:33:50.454 --> 02:33:52.089
LOOKED AT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

02:33:52.156 --> 02:33:54.425
COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

02:33:54.491 --> 02:33:56.994
FRAMEWORK AND WHO SHOULD BE

02:33:57.061 --> 02:33:58.629
RESPONSIBLE FOR. WE FELT THAT IT

02:33:58.696 --> 02:33:59.496
NEEDED TO BE THE OVERSIGHT

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:00.731
COMMISSION AND THE REASON FOR

02:34:00.798 --> 02:34:02.566
THAT IS THEY ALREADY HAVE SOME

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:16.313

ARE WE SPENDING ON INPATIENT

02:34:56.487 --> 02:34:58.055
CARE VERSUS OUTPATIENT THEN

02:34:58.122 --> 02:35:00.457
IDENTIFYING SOME INDICATORS SOME

02:35:00.524 --> 02:35:01.992
THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER THE

02:35:02.059 --> 02:35:03.193
PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE

02:35:03.260 --> 02:35:04.895
BEEN INCARCERATED DUE TO A

02:35:04.962 --> 02:35:06.397
MENTAL ILLNESS OR SOMETHING THEY

02:35:07.831 --> 02:35:09.533
DUE TO MENTAL ILLNESS HOW MANY

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.335
REPEAT HOLDS HAS AN INDIVIDUAL

02:35:11.402 --> 02:35:13.003
BEEN THROUGH. THE RATES OF

02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:15.205
SUICIDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS

02:35:15.272 --> 02:35:16.874
RECEIVING TREATMENT SOME

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:18.709
DIFFERENT INDICATORS TO BE ABLE

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:20.044
TO ASSESS HOW SUCCESSFUL

02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:21.545
CALIFORNIA'S IN PROVIDING

02:35:21.612 --> 02:35:24.648
SERVICES. TO THE MENTALLY ILL IN

02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:26.083
OUR STATE. SO THAT WAS ANOTHER

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:27.418
RECOMMENDATION TO DIRECTLY

02:35:27.484 --> 02:35:28.619
OVERSIGHT COMMISSION TO DEVELOP

02:35:28.686 --> 02:35:30.054
THE STATE WIDE MEASURES AGAIN

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.055
WORKING WITH STATE AND LOCAL

02:35:31.121 --> 02:35:33.257
OFFICIALS TO REALLY AND EXPERTS

02:35:33.323 --> 02:35:34.224
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT CAN WE

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:36.193
MEASURE. AND WORK WHEN WE

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:37.161
DETERMINE WHAT WE WANT TO

02:35:37.227 --> 02:35:38.328
MEASURE THAT TELLS YOU WHAT YOU

02:35:38.395 --> 02:35:40.230
NEED TO COLLECT TO BE ABLE TO US

02:35:40.297 --> 02:35:42.199
TO USE THAT MEASUREMENT. TO

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:43.834
ASSESS HOW SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA

02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:45.669
IS. AND THEN TWO OTHER

02:35:45.736 --> 02:35:47.571
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO M. M.

02:35:47.638 --> 02:35:50.908
HSA. AND ONE IS TO AMEND STATE

02:35:50.974 --> 02:35:52.943
LAW TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET.

02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:55.312
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LEFT LPS

02:35:55.379 --> 02:35:58.982
ACT HOLDS TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE

02:35:59.049 --> 02:36:00.617
SERVICES THROUGH AN HSA. SO

02:36:00.684 --> 02:36:02.186
THOSE AT THAT WOULD REALLY TIE

02:36:02.252 --> 02:36:03.420
INTO THIS ASSISTED OUTPATIENT

02:36:03.487 --> 02:36:04.822
TREATMENT YOU CAN USE PREVENTION

02:36:04.888 --> 02:36:06.457

COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES

02:36:08.125 --> 02:36:11.295
FUNDS- FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO

02:36:11.361 --> 02:36:11.895
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE TYPES

02:36:11.962 --> 02:36:13.864
OF SERVICES. TO INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:36:13.931 --> 02:36:15.199
ARE COMING OFF OF THESE HOLD

02:36:15.265 --> 02:36:16.433
BECAUSE THE INTENT OF THE ACT

02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:18.035
AND I THINK. THE DESIRE FOR ALL

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:20.037
CALIFORNIANS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO

02:36:20.104 --> 02:36:22.039
HAVE THESE ILLNESSES AND ON FOR

02:36:22.106 --> 02:36:23.273
ARE PLACED ON A HOLD FOR THEIR

02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:25.476
OWN PERSONAL SAFETY. TO GET THEM

02:36:25.542 --> 02:36:27.411
THE HELP THEY NEED TO BE

02:36:27.478 --> 02:36:29.413
SUCCESSFUL AND TO HAVE A VERY

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.115
ACCEPT SUCCESSFUL COMFORTABLE

02:36:31.181 --> 02:36:33.317
LIFE IN CALIFORNIA SO. SO THAT

02:36:33.383 --> 02:36:34.785
WAS ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT

02:36:34.852 --> 02:36:36.954
WE HAD AND THEN. FINALLY

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.389
ESTABLISH A GOAL AND MENTAL

02:36:39.456 --> 02:36:41.058
HEALTH SERVICES ACT FOR

02:36:41.125 --> 02:36:43.393
CONNECTING ALL INDIVIDUALS TO

02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:45.395
COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS SO

02:36:45.462 --> 02:36:46.530
WE'VE GOT THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:48.499
TO PROVIDE IT. LET'S DETERMINE

02:36:48.565 --> 02:36:50.033
THE INDICATORS HOWARD WHAT

02:36:50.100 --> 02:36:51.835
OUTCOMES WE WANT TO WE WANT TO

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:53.737
ACHIEVE. AND THEN WHAT TYPE OF

02:36:53.804 --> 02:36:55.639
DAY WE NEED TO COLLECT BUT MAKE

02:36:55.706 --> 02:36:57.040
IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR AND THAT

02:36:57.107 --> 02:36:58.776
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THAT.

02:36:58.842 --> 02:37:00.711
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE SPECIFIC

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:02.312
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE WANT THESE

02:37:02.379 --> 02:37:04.982
FUNDS TO BE USED FOR AND TO

02:37:05.048 --> 02:37:07.284
SUPPORT. SO WITHOUT MEMBERS. I

02:37:07.351 --> 02:37:08.418
WILL ALLOW ABOUT TO ANSWER ALL

02:37:08.485 --> 02:37:10.354
YOUR DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. THANK

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:12.322
YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU

02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:14.792
HUNDREDS OF COUPLE QUESTIONS ON.

02:37:14.858 --> 02:37:17.027
DID YOU GET A SENSE IS IT. YOU

02:37:17.094 --> 02:37:19.129
WERE TALKING TO THE COUNTIES. HE

02:37:19.196 --> 02:37:20.330
SAID THAT THERE ARE NINETEEN

02:37:20.397 --> 02:37:21.665
COUNTIES THAT HEAD OFFICE IS

02:37:21.732 --> 02:37:23.167
THAT A PATIENT TREATMENT AND THE

02:37:23.233 --> 02:37:23.767
OTHERS HAD AND NOW THAT IT'S

02:37:23.834 --> 02:37:25.669
INCREASED. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE

02:37:25.736 --> 02:37:28.639
REASONS WHY DID YOU GET. A SENSE

02:37:28.705 --> 02:37:30.607
OF THAT. BUT HARRIS FOR THE

02:37:30.674 --> 02:37:32.209
STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SIR. BUT

02:37:32.276 --> 02:37:33.811
THE THREE COUNTIES WE AUDITED

02:37:33.877 --> 02:37:35.512
HAD ALREADY EITHER IMPLEMENTED

02:37:35.579 --> 02:37:37.481
A. O. T. OR A PILOT VERSION OF

02:37:37.548 --> 02:37:39.049
IT. SO WHAT WE DID TO TAKE A

02:37:39.116 --> 02:37:40.284
LOOK AT WHY SOME COUNTIES MAY

02:37:40.350 --> 02:37:42.619
NOT BE IMPLEMENTING A O. T. AT

02:37:42.686 --> 02:37:43.420
THE TIME AS WE LOOK AT THREE

02:37:43.487 --> 02:37:45.522
OTHERS THAT- HAD NOT YET AT

02:37:45.589 --> 02:37:46.590
LEAST YOU COUNTY WAS ONE OF

02:37:46.657 --> 02:37:49.293
THEM- AND I'M- NOT REMEMBERING

02:37:49.359 --> 02:37:50.227
THE OTHER TWO OFF THE TOP OF MY

02:37:50.294 --> 02:37:51.428
HEAD BUT WE DID TAKE A LOOK AT

02:37:51.495 --> 02:37:52.996
THEIR- PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

02:37:53.063 --> 02:37:54.298
WHETHER TO ADOPT A T. AT THE

02:37:54.364 --> 02:37:56.166
TIME THE CONCERNS ESSENTIALLY

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:57.334
BOIL DOWN TO TWO FACTORS ONE WAS

02:37:57.401 --> 02:37:59.169
COST. AND THE OTHER WAS SOME

02:37:59.236 --> 02:38:00.404
CONCERN THAT THIS WOULD BE A

02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:02.639
DUPLICATION OF SERVICES SO THOSE

02:38:02.706 --> 02:38:03.407
ARE THE CENTRAL REASONS WE

02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:05.475
DETERMINED. THERE MIGHT BE

02:38:05.542 --> 02:38:06.844
RESISTANCE TO ADOPTING ANTI.

02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:09.146
OKAY AND THEN THEN THAT MAKES

02:38:09.213 --> 02:38:10.247
SENSE- JUST WONDERING ABOUT THAT

02:38:10.314 --> 02:38:11.882
YOU TALK ABOUT THE FRACTURE THE

02:38:11.949 --> 02:38:12.749
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM I THINK

02:38:12.816 --> 02:38:14.685
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE'VE

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.486
BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING WITH OVER

02:38:16.553 --> 02:38:17.855
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AT

02:38:17.921 --> 02:38:18.388
LEAST THOSE OF US IN THE

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:19.990
LEGISLATURE AND- GOES BACK

02:38:20.057 --> 02:38:21.925
DECADES. AS THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN

02:38:21.992 --> 02:38:23.861
DISMANTLED ESPECIALLY

02:38:23.927 --> 02:38:25.629
DISMANTLING THE STATE HOSPITALS.

02:38:25.696 --> 02:38:27.130
THERE WAS NOTHING BUILT BACK UP

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:28.999
I THINK THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO

02:38:29.066 --> 02:38:31.702
BE. A INCREASING CAPACITY AT THE

02:38:31.768 --> 02:38:33.203
LOCAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE EXACTLY

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:34.471
THE BEDS AND THINGS THAT YOU'RE

02:38:34.538 --> 02:38:35.472
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S

02:38:35.539 --> 02:38:37.274
REALLY NEVER HAPPENED AND SO

02:38:37.341 --> 02:38:37.908
WE'VE ENDED UP WITH A FRACTURED

02:38:37.975 --> 02:38:39.910
SYSTEM. AND I THINK WE'LL

02:38:39.977 --> 02:38:41.645
DISCONNECT BETWEEN STATE AND

02:38:41.712 --> 02:38:46.884
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. AND ABILITIES

02:38:46.950 --> 02:38:48.619
. MARULA LACK OF SO. OF COUNTIES

02:38:48.685 --> 02:38:50.320
THEY'VE BEEN. WITH THIS BECAUSE

02:38:50.387 --> 02:38:51.154
AND IT'S INTERESTING YOU LOOKED

02:38:51.221 --> 02:38:52.589
AT SOME LARGE COUNTIES AND YOU

02:38:52.656 --> 02:38:54.258
LOOK AT SOME SMALL COUNTIES. I

02:38:54.324 --> 02:38:54.791
THINK THEY'RE FROM VERY

02:38:54.858 --> 02:38:57.160
DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION

02:38:57.227 --> 02:38:57.728
QUESTIONS LARGE COUNTIES TO

02:38:57.794 --> 02:38:59.096
SMALL COUNTIES. AND THEIR

02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:02.633
ABILITY TO MANAGE THE POPULATION

02:39:02.699 --> 02:39:05.068
THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO SO IN

02:39:05.135 --> 02:39:06.670
IN YOUR SENSE WITH THE COUNTIES

02:39:06.737 --> 02:39:08.939
YOU DID TALK TO THAT AYE IT

02:39:09.006 --> 02:39:11.541
ASKED THE AGENCY EARLIER ABOUT

02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:13.243
ABOUT A BACKLOG THEY SAID THERE

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:15.746
IS NO BACKLOG ALTHOUGH IN AS I'M

02:39:15.812 --> 02:39:18.148
DEALING WITH AND TALKING TO TWO

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:19.650
COUNTIES THEY'RE VERY FRUSTRATED

02:39:19.716 --> 02:39:21.919
WITH THE LICENSING PROCESS SO

02:39:21.985 --> 02:39:24.154
FROM YOUR SENSE IN THE DATA THAT

02:39:24.221 --> 02:39:25.956
YOU LOOKED AT AND TEN PART OF

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:27.958
HIS HEARING HAS REALLY REVEALED.

02:39:28.025 --> 02:39:29.226
SOME SIGNIFICANT DATA

02:39:29.293 --> 02:39:30.460
DISCREPANCIES WHICH ARE

02:39:30.527 --> 02:39:31.795
CHALLENGING AND YOU WERE ABLE TO

02:39:31.862 --> 02:39:33.597
GO INTO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

02:39:33.664 --> 02:39:36.500
AND GET INFORMATION THAT DACA'S

02:39:36.566 --> 02:39:39.536
DID NOT HAVE AND WE DO SO MUCH

02:39:39.603 --> 02:39:42.139
IN THE STATE IN SILOS IS REALLY

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:45.275
FRUSTRATING N. IN IN HIS OR THE

02:39:45.342 --> 02:39:46.810
ABILITY OF THE RIGHT INFORMATION

02:39:46.877 --> 02:39:48.745
GETTING TO THE RIGHT. DECISION

02:39:48.812 --> 02:39:50.681
MAKERS AT THE RIGHT TIME IN

02:39:50.747 --> 02:39:52.482
ORDER TO EFFECTUATE THIS AND

02:39:52.549 --> 02:39:53.784
SOME OF THE REASONS ARE GOOD A

02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:56.119
LOT OF THE REASONS OR JUST

02:39:56.186 --> 02:40:01.558
BECAUSE OF HOW WE'VE ALL DONE IT. OR BUREAUCRACIES OR OR

02:40:01.625 --> 02:40:02.859
WHATEVER. BUT IF YOU'RE DEALING

02:40:02.926 --> 02:40:03.794
WITH THE COUNTY THAT LEAST THE

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.395
SUBSET THAT YOU LOOKED AT ARE

02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:08.765
THEY GETTING. THE ARE THEY ABLE

02:40:08.832 --> 02:40:10.534
TO GET THE FACILITIES THEY FEEL

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:12.970
THAT THEY NEED LICENSE AND UP TO

02:40:13.036 --> 02:40:14.237
SPEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:40:14.304 --> 02:40:17.107
THESE SERVICES. SO WHAT WOULD

02:40:17.174 --> 02:40:18.942
THERE'S- THERE'S A BIT OF A

02:40:19.009 --> 02:40:20.677
DISCONNECTED I'M NOT SURE I

02:40:20.744 --> 02:40:23.080
QUITE UNDERSTAND. RIGHT SO WE

02:40:23.146 --> 02:40:24.448
DIDN'T LOOK AT THE LICENSING

02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:26.650
COMPONENT- IN TERMS OF THE

02:40:26.717 --> 02:40:28.285
DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THIRD.

02:40:28.352 --> 02:40:29.686
HEALTHCARE SERVICE NICE I THINK

02:40:29.753 --> 02:40:30.921
NUMBERS OF FACILITIES THAT

02:40:30.988 --> 02:40:31.989
CORRECTIVE REALLY DIFFERENT

02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:33.690
FACILITIES ONLINE AS NEEDED.

02:40:33.757 --> 02:40:35.225
RIGHT SO WE DID LOOK AT THE

02:40:35.292 --> 02:40:37.461
HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROCESS FOR

02:40:37.527 --> 02:40:39.162
APPROVING DESIGNATED FACILITIES

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:40.430
CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS OF

02:40:40.497 --> 02:40:41.631
DESIGNATED SO AS WE DON'T HAVE

02:40:41.698 --> 02:40:43.166
ANY CONCERNS THAT WE FOUND IN

02:40:43.233 --> 02:40:45.035
THAT AREA EVERYTHING SEEMED OKAY

02:40:45.102 --> 02:40:47.004
TO US IN THAT AREA SO. I DON'T

02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:48.138
THINK WE HAVE ANY OBSERVATIONS

02:40:48.205 --> 02:40:50.440
RELATED TO A BACKLOG OR PENDING

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:52.309
DEMAND FOR FACILITY DESIGNATION

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:53.877
THERE ARE CERTAINLY THOUGH THE

02:40:53.944 --> 02:40:55.045
CONCERNS WE NOTED ABOUT BED

02:40:55.112 --> 02:40:57.514
CAPACITY GENERALLY- ONE OF THE

02:40:57.581 --> 02:40:58.382
WAYS YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT IS

02:40:58.448 --> 02:40:59.449
BY BRINGING MORE FACILITIES

02:40:59.516 --> 02:41:01.585
ONLINE BUT WE DIDN'T SEE. A LOG

02:41:01.651 --> 02:41:04.855
JAM OR A PROBLEM WITH GETTING

02:41:04.921 --> 02:41:06.156
THOSE FACILITIES APPROVED. OKAY

02:41:06.223 --> 02:41:08.025
SO YES I'M STILL KIND OF SCRATCH

02:41:08.091 --> 02:41:09.826
MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT WHAT. WHERE

02:41:09.893 --> 02:41:12.062
THE DISCONNECT IS. IS OUR

02:41:12.129 --> 02:41:14.097
COUNTIES. NOT ASKING FOR THE

02:41:14.164 --> 02:41:16.767
RIGHT FACILITIES DO WE NOT HAVE

02:41:16.833 --> 02:41:19.870
THE RIGHT MIX OF FACILITIES- AND

02:41:19.936 --> 02:41:21.338
SOME OF IT'S GOING TO BE FUNDING

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:22.773
RELATED AND OTHERS AND I DON'T

02:41:22.839 --> 02:41:23.840
KNOW THAT YOU CAN NECESSARILY

02:41:23.907 --> 02:41:25.308
ANSWER THAT BUT THAT'S THAT IS A

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:27.711
COMPONENT HERE THAT THAT I THINK

02:41:27.778 --> 02:41:29.746
NEEDS TO REALLY BE THE LOOKED AT

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:31.815
AND ADDRESSED AND FROM WHAT YOU

02:41:31.882 --> 02:41:33.617
FOUND ME ONE OF THE UNDERLYING

02:41:33.683 --> 02:41:34.851
REASONS THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS

02:41:34.918 --> 02:41:37.154
HEARING IS SOME REQUESTS TO

02:41:37.220 --> 02:41:39.423
EXPAND. DEFINITION OF GRAVELY

02:41:39.489 --> 02:41:43.326
DISABLED SO FOR EXPANDING. THE

02:41:43.393 --> 02:41:45.462
DEFINITIONS TO BRING MORE PEOPLE

02:41:45.529 --> 02:41:47.297
INTO THE L. P. S. KIND OF

02:41:47.364 --> 02:41:49.699
AUTHORITY. JUDGING BY WHAT YOU

02:41:49.766 --> 02:41:51.134
HAD SEEN WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:53.437
IMPACT ON THE SYSTEM FOR DOING.

02:41:53.503 --> 02:41:56.039
THAT BUT THE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

02:41:56.106 --> 02:41:59.543
THE SYSTEM'S ALREADY. STRAINED

02:41:59.609 --> 02:42:01.378
TO COMPLETELY UNABLE IN SOME

02:42:01.445 --> 02:42:03.380
CASES THEY HANDLE THE- DEMAND IF

02:42:03.447 --> 02:42:06.516
YOU WILL OR THE NEED FOR BEDS-

02:42:06.583 --> 02:42:08.652
SO. THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS

02:42:08.718 --> 02:42:10.087
WIDENING THE POOL OF PEOPLE WHO

02:42:10.153 --> 02:42:11.755
WOULD NEED THOSE BEDS ARE NEED

02:42:11.822 --> 02:42:14.124
THOSE SERVICES WOULD PUT FURTHER

02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:16.560
STRAIN ON THE SYSTEM. EVERYTHING

02:42:16.626 --> 02:42:19.262
FROM YOUR RECORD THAT. YOU'RE

02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:21.198
CLEARLY POINTING OUT SOME OF THE

02:42:21.264 --> 02:42:22.365
WEAKNESS IS THE SYSTEM THAT

02:42:22.432 --> 02:42:24.968
WOULD PROBABLY E BETTER SERVED

02:42:25.035 --> 02:42:26.703
TO BOLSTER AND SUPPORT AND

02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:28.438
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S FUNDING

02:42:28.505 --> 02:42:29.339
FOR KIND OF SETTING BETTER

02:42:29.406 --> 02:42:31.374
FRAMEWORKS BEFORE WE REALLY

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:33.710
EXPANDS. ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE

02:42:33.777 --> 02:42:34.911
THAT RIGHT THERE REALLY BEGS THE

02:42:34.978 --> 02:42:35.946
QUESTION OF WHERE WITH THOSE

02:42:36.012 --> 02:42:38.482
FOLKS GO AND HOW ARE THEY

02:42:38.548 --> 02:42:47.991
ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE SERVED SO. AND THEN AFTER I MET THANK YOU

02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:49.559
TO OUR SON I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP

02:42:49.626 --> 02:42:51.962
ON- THE PERMITTING IF IT'S NOT

02:42:52.028 --> 02:42:54.664
LICENSING HERE AT THE STATE IS

02:42:54.731 --> 02:42:55.298
THERE ANYTHING HAPPENING AT THE

02:42:55.365 --> 02:42:57.334
LOCAL LEVEL THAT MAY BE

02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:59.236
PROHIBITING AN APPROVAL PROCESS

02:42:59.302 --> 02:43:01.705
SUCH AS NIMBYISM REGARDING

02:43:01.771 --> 02:43:05.542
HAVING- THESE FACILITIES. IN THE

02:43:05.609 --> 02:43:07.978
COMMUNITY. SO AND FORCE I DON'T

02:43:08.044 --> 02:43:09.012
THINK WE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT

02:43:09.079 --> 02:43:10.614
WE DIDN'T LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:12.015
THE COUNTY PROCESSES FOR

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:13.150
DESIGNATING FACILITIES AND

02:43:13.216 --> 02:43:15.418
WHETHER THERE IS. OBSTACLES IN

02:43:15.485 --> 02:43:18.221
THAT AREA. I WILL HIGHLIGHT FOR

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:19.890
MY COLLEAGUES THAT ON PAGE

02:43:19.956 --> 02:43:20.724
TWENTY THREE OF THE HAND OUT

02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:23.059
THERE IS SOME INFORMATION

02:43:23.126 --> 02:43:24.861
REGARDING. THE CONCERN ABOUT

02:43:24.928 --> 02:43:29.099
NIMBYISM- AND- THE NEED FOR US

02:43:29.166 --> 02:43:30.200
TO HELP TO REMOVE SOME OF THE

02:43:30.267 --> 02:43:32.135
RED TAPE AND SO I HOPE TO FOLLOW

02:43:32.202 --> 02:43:33.837
UP WITH MANY OF US TO FIGURE

02:43:33.904 --> 02:43:36.139
OUT. HOW WE CAN HAVE THESE

02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:38.375
CONTINUE ONCE BUILT OUT. I THINK

02:43:38.441 --> 02:43:39.943
IT'S IMPORTANT IF WE HAVE

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:41.778
INVESTED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO

02:43:41.845 --> 02:43:43.513
MAKE SURE THAT THESE FACILITIES

02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:44.214
ARE GOING TO THE VERY

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:46.016
COMMUNITIES THAT. NEED THEM THE

02:43:46.082 --> 02:43:48.151
MOST. I'M WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:49.853
UP ALSO ON THE SEILING OF

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:52.389
INFORMATION I THINK IT WAS A

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:53.890
POWERFUL STATEMENT REGARDING

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:56.326
THAT DOJ HAD THE INFORMATION BUT

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:58.228
THE IT'S THE US DID NOT. AND SO

02:43:58.295 --> 02:44:00.030
I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S

02:44:00.096 --> 02:44:02.799
ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO. ENCOURAGE

02:44:02.866 --> 02:44:04.734
THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE

02:44:04.801 --> 02:44:05.268
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

02:44:05.335 --> 02:44:07.671
SERVICES AND ARE CUNTY PARTNERS

02:44:07.737 --> 02:44:10.273
TO. MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE

02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:12.742
LEAVING THE L. P. S. ACT HOLDS

02:44:12.809 --> 02:44:14.444
ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:16.913
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED- ARE

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:18.582
THERE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

02:44:18.648 --> 02:44:21.751
HE WOULD HAVE FOR US TO FOLLOW

02:44:21.818 --> 02:44:22.752
UP ON. YEAH THERE ARE SO OUR

02:44:22.819 --> 02:44:24.321
RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY WAS

02:44:24.387 --> 02:44:26.556
THAT THE INFORMATION SHARING IS

02:44:26.623 --> 02:44:28.692
ALREADY REQUIRED TO OCCUR AND IS

02:44:28.758 --> 02:44:30.827
OCCURRING BETWEEN THE DESIGNATED

02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:31.828
FACILITIES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:44:31.895 --> 02:44:33.964
JUSTICE. UNDER TWO OF THE THREE

02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:35.799
HOLD CRITERIA THAT'S DANGER TO

02:44:35.865 --> 02:44:37.300
SELF IMAGE DANGER TO OTHERS.

02:44:37.367 --> 02:44:38.401
THAT INFORMATION ALREADY FLOWS

02:44:38.468 --> 02:44:39.936
UP TO THE STATE LEVEL OUR

02:44:40.003 --> 02:44:41.238
RECOMMENDATION IS THE STATE

02:44:41.304 --> 02:44:42.872
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:43.440
STATE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE

02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:45.242
SERVICES SHARE THAT INFORMATION

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:46.776
SPECIFICALLY JUSTICE SHARES WITH

02:44:46.843 --> 02:44:48.411
HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AND THAT

02:44:48.478 --> 02:44:50.080
HEALTHCARE SERVICESTHAN IN PART

02:44:50.146 --> 02:44:51.081
PARTNERING WITH THE COUNTY

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:52.015
SHARES IT DOWN TO THE COUNTY

02:44:52.082 --> 02:44:54.517
LEVEL. THAT WOULD GET YOU THAT

02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:55.819
THE INDIVIDUALS HELD ON THE

02:44:55.885 --> 02:44:58.121
FIRST TWO CRITERIA. THERE WOULD

02:44:58.188 --> 02:44:59.322
NEED TO BE A CHANGE TO STATE LAW

02:44:59.389 --> 02:45:01.124
ALSO TO REQUIRE THE FACILITIES

02:45:01.191 --> 02:45:02.125
TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO HEALTH

02:45:02.192 --> 02:45:05.528
CARE SERVICES ABOUT. INDIVIDUALS

02:45:05.595 --> 02:45:06.162
HELD UNDER THE GRAVELY DISABLED

02:45:06.229 --> 02:45:08.198
CRITERION. WHICH THEY COULD THEN

02:45:08.265 --> 02:45:09.232
REPORT BACK DOWN TO THE

02:45:09.299 --> 02:45:11.768
COUNTIES- THERE WOULD ALSO NEED

02:45:11.835 --> 02:45:12.836
TO BE CHANGES TO STATE LAW WITH

02:45:12.902 --> 02:45:13.870
RESPECT TO WHAT HEALTHCARE

02:45:13.937 --> 02:45:15.171
SERVICES ALLOWED TO POSSESS

02:45:15.238 --> 02:45:16.006
BECAUSE THEY ARE CURRENTLY

02:45:16.072 --> 02:45:17.374
PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.475
PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:19.843
INFORMATION. WHICH THIS WOULD

02:45:19.909 --> 02:45:21.478
CERTAINLY INCLUDE BUT IT WOULD

02:45:21.544 --> 02:45:22.946
IT IT WOULD BE IN SERVICE OF

02:45:23.013 --> 02:45:24.547
GETTING THAT INFORMATION TO THE

02:45:24.614 --> 02:45:26.783
COUNTIES TO AS YOU. INDICATED

02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:28.118
ALLOW THOSE COUNTIES TO CONTACT

02:45:28.184 --> 02:45:29.486
THOSE INDIVIDUALS KNOW THAT THEY

02:45:29.552 --> 02:45:30.920
WERE EVEN HELD RIGHT NOW

02:45:30.987 --> 02:45:32.555
COUNTIES DON'T EVEN KNOW THE

02:45:32.622 --> 02:45:34.658
FULL SOME OF INDIVIDUALS HELD.

02:45:34.724 --> 02:45:36.026
SO THAT THEY COULD TRY AND

02:45:36.092 --> 02:45:38.094
CONNECT THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY

02:45:38.161 --> 02:45:40.030
WITH SERVICES POST HOLD. AND IT

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:41.331
SEEMS THAT PART OF YOUR

02:45:41.398 --> 02:45:42.732
RECOMMENDATION WAS REGARDING AS

02:45:42.799 --> 02:45:44.701
WELL THE MHSAA FUNDS AND I'M

02:45:44.768 --> 02:45:45.802
WONDERING IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL

02:45:45.869 --> 02:45:48.138
FLEXIBILITIES THAT. WE MAY NEED

02:45:48.204 --> 02:45:50.607
TO. PROVIDE SO THAT COUNTIES CAN

02:45:50.674 --> 02:45:53.243
USE THESE FUNDS FOR. THOSE AFTER

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:54.744
THE L. P. S. ACTON HOPING.

02:45:54.811 --> 02:45:56.913
PROVIDING MORE. CONTRITE SO

02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:58.315
WE'RE WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT

02:45:58.381 --> 02:46:00.016
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEAVING

02:46:00.083 --> 02:46:01.951
LPS HOLDS BE IDENTIFIED AS A

02:46:02.018 --> 02:46:03.553
PRIORITY TARGET POPULATION UNDER

INVOLUNTARY CARE WE'RE NOT

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:15.265
RECOMMENDING A CHANGE TO THAT

02:46:15.332 --> 02:46:16.399
BUT WE DO THINK THAT THE POST

02:46:16.466 --> 02:46:19.936
HOLD CARE NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY

02:46:20.003 --> 02:46:21.137

MISTER STONES QUESTIONS- AND I

DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM

02:48:28.798 --> 02:48:30.934
IS LOOKING TO YOU KNOW HOLD MORE

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.268
PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR WILL I

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:34.504
THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.139
LOOKING TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE

02:48:36.206 --> 02:48:38.775
AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IN OUR IS

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:41.778
DISTRESSED AS THE PUBLIC BY WHAT

02:48:41.845 --> 02:48:42.912
WE SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE

02:48:42.979 --> 02:48:45.849
STREETS- I WOULD I WOULD SAY

02:48:45.915 --> 02:48:47.884
WITHOUT EXCEPTION THAT IS

02:48:47.951 --> 02:48:50.520
EVERYBODY'S GOAL- AND IN THE

02:48:50.587 --> 02:48:51.921
MORE OF COURSE WE TALK ABOUT IT

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.756
AND THE MORE. YOU KNOW BECOMES

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:55.792
QUITE APPARENT THAT WE HAVE A

02:48:55.859 --> 02:48:58.628
HUGE BREAKDOWN OF OUR ENTIRE

02:48:58.695 --> 02:49:00.830
SYSTEM I THINK YOU KNOW TWO

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:03.366
THINGS CAN BE TRUE RIGHT AT THE

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:03.900
COUNTIES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:49:03.967 --> 02:49:06.569
FUNDING TO DO IT- AND WE'VE

02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:07.704
GIVEN THE CAN IS A TON OF MONEY

02:49:07.770 --> 02:49:08.938
TO DO IT I MEAN BOTH OF BOTH

02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:10.573
THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE AND SO

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:12.075
CLEARLY THERE'S A DISCONNECT AND

02:49:12.141 --> 02:49:14.878
A BREAK DOWN AT SOME LEVEL- THE

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:18.214
LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF- OF STEP

02:49:18.281 --> 02:49:19.782
DOWN CARE OF STEP DOWN FUNDING

02:49:19.849 --> 02:49:22.519
OF STEPPED OUT HOUSING- WE HEARD

02:49:22.585 --> 02:49:25.989
FROM PEOPLE WHO WHO HAVE

02:49:26.055 --> 02:49:27.156
EXPERIENCED- THE WHOLE.

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:29.158
THEMSELVES AND I'M SURE WE'VE

02:49:29.225 --> 02:49:31.461
ALL TALKED TO MOTHERS. WHO ARE

02:49:31.528 --> 02:49:33.897
MOTHERS OF. FORTY FIFTY YEAR OLD

02:49:33.963 --> 02:49:35.598
OF CHILDREN WHO ARE STUPID CAT

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:36.966
OFFSPRING WHO ARE STILL.

02:49:37.033 --> 02:49:39.636
STRUGGLING TO FIND SAFE PLACES

02:49:39.702 --> 02:49:40.637
TO LIVE DESPITE BEING ON OUR

02:49:40.703 --> 02:49:42.639
SYSTEM. FOR THE ENTIRETY OF

02:49:42.705 --> 02:49:43.773
THEIR ADULT LIVES AND THAT AND

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:45.975
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY- SO

02:49:46.042 --> 02:49:47.744
I THINK I THINK WHAT WE WERE ALL

02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:49.479
JUST COMING DEEPER AND DEEPER TO

02:49:49.546 --> 02:49:51.681
REALIZE IS. IS A WELL L. PS MAY

02:49:51.748 --> 02:49:53.116
NOT BE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM IT

02:49:53.182 --> 02:49:55.251
HAS SERVED AS A SOLUTION FOR

02:49:55.318 --> 02:49:57.887
SOME. IN A TEMPORARY FASHION BUT

02:49:57.954 --> 02:50:00.256
IT IS ONLY. FOR A TEMPORARY

02:50:00.323 --> 02:50:02.125
PERIOD OF TIME AND UNLESS WE

02:50:02.191 --> 02:50:04.527
HAVE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS. AS

02:50:04.594 --> 02:50:05.995
I WOULD LIKE TO I THINK WE HAVE

02:50:06.062 --> 02:50:07.764
AS A AS A SOCIETY AS A STATE WE

02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:09.465
HAVE FAILED. ON TO BE ABLE TO

02:50:09.532 --> 02:50:11.267
PROVIDE THAT STEP DOWN CARE THAT

02:50:11.334 --> 02:50:13.236
IS SO NEEDED. I THINK WE MUST DO

02:50:13.303 --> 02:50:14.938
A BETTER JOB BECAUSE WE'RE ON

02:50:15.004 --> 02:50:16.439
THE COMMUNITY. THE COUNTIES ARE

02:50:16.506 --> 02:50:17.840
TELLING US THEY CAN'T GET THINGS

02:50:17.907 --> 02:50:19.442
LICENSE THEY CAN'T GET THAT

02:50:19.509 --> 02:50:20.777
PERMIT FROM THE STAFF AT THE

02:50:20.843 --> 02:50:22.745
STATE THEY CAN'T. ALL THESE

02:50:22.812 --> 02:50:24.380
BARRIERS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

02:50:24.447 --> 02:50:26.115
FROM THE STAFF FROM THE STATE.

02:50:26.182 --> 02:50:27.250
STATE TELLING US THERE THERE'S

02:50:27.317 --> 02:50:29.052
NO BACKLOG THERE'S NO. WE DON'T

02:50:29.118 --> 02:50:31.554
UNDERSTAND- SO IT'S POLICYMAKERS

02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:32.622
WE SET UP HERE AND SCRATCH YOUR

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:34.390
HEAD. BECAUSE WE'RE ALL LOOKING

02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:35.792
TO KICK DOWN BARRIERS IF WE

02:50:35.858 --> 02:50:37.694
POSSIBLY CAN. TO MAKE THINGS

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:39.395
BETTER. AND SO I CAN THINK WE

02:50:39.462 --> 02:50:40.296
KEEP COMING BACK TO THE SAME

02:50:40.363 --> 02:50:44.834
POINT LIKE WHAT IS IT THAT. THEN

02:50:44.901 --> 02:50:45.702
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING BESIDES

02:50:45.768 --> 02:50:47.337
. AND I AM SAY IT. LIKE AGAIN AT

02:50:47.403 --> 02:50:48.037
THE I DON'T KNOW WE NEED TO

02:50:48.104 --> 02:50:49.639
DECISION ON THE GOVERNOR THE-

02:50:49.706 --> 02:50:50.740
STATE OF DEPARTMENT HEALTH AT

02:50:50.807 --> 02:50:51.774
LEAST THERE WAS SOME KIND OF

02:50:51.841 --> 02:50:54.210
BACKSTOP- AND I'M NOT ABOVE LIKE

02:50:54.277 --> 02:50:55.745
SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE. FOR

02:50:55.812 --> 02:50:57.614
TEMPORARY TIME WE GO BACK AND BE

02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:00.350
ABLE TO JUST. I MEAN. WE NEED TO

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:01.217
BE ABLE TO TREAT THESE PEOPLE

02:51:01.284 --> 02:51:03.086
WHO ARE NOT. IN EVERYBODY'S

02:51:03.152 --> 02:51:04.487
COUNTY IT IS IT IS. WE SHOULD

02:51:04.554 --> 02:51:06.456
NOT. HAVE TO GO TO THE

02:51:06.522 --> 02:51:08.424
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. BECAUSE

02:51:08.491 --> 02:51:10.493
THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE. IT FOR THE

02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:11.828
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OR OR

02:51:11.894 --> 02:51:13.029
BEING HELD AGAINST HER WILL

02:51:13.096 --> 02:51:13.930
THAT'S ALREADY FAR DOWN THE

02:51:13.997 --> 02:51:16.399
LINE. THAT IS ALREADY FAR DOWN

02:51:16.466 --> 02:51:18.034
THE LINE. IF WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:51:18.101 --> 02:51:19.302
HOW MANY PEOPLE THOSE ARE

02:51:19.369 --> 02:51:20.503
IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE WE DON'T

02:51:20.570 --> 02:51:21.537
KNOW ON THE FRONT END.

02:51:21.604 --> 02:51:22.905
ESPECIALLY AS WE KNOW THE CRISIS

02:51:22.972 --> 02:51:23.973
COMING UP RIGHT NOW IN OUR

02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:25.441
SCHOOLS AND- AND WITH OUR KIDS

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:27.510
SO. I GUESS NOW I'M REALLY NOT

02:51:27.577 --> 02:51:28.444
BE LANE HOME BECAUSE I'M NOT

02:51:28.511 --> 02:51:30.747
BEING DIRECT AT ALL- BUT JUST TO

02:51:30.813 --> 02:51:32.315
SAY. I THINK ALL OF US ARE

02:51:32.382 --> 02:51:34.317
DEDICATED AND CERTAINLY

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:37.286
INVESTED- NOT JUST TO EXPAND LPS

02:51:37.353 --> 02:51:38.655
THAT IS NOT ANYBODY'S GOAL JUST

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:39.922
TO EXPAND THE- AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

02:51:39.989 --> 02:51:41.224
WERE HOLDING AGAINST THEIR WILL.

02:51:41.290 --> 02:51:43.459
OUR GOAL. IS TO HELP AS MANY

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:44.794
PEOPLE AS WE POSSIBLY CAN NOT

02:51:44.861 --> 02:51:46.763
REACH THAT LEVEL. AND TO BE ABLE

02:51:46.829 --> 02:51:49.098
TO LEAD A GOOD EFFECTIVE LIVE SO

02:51:49.165 --> 02:51:50.199
I THINK ALL OF US WILL CONTINUE

02:51:50.266 --> 02:51:51.768
TO LOOK AT LEGISLATION AND

02:51:51.834 --> 02:51:53.703
OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT- I

02:51:53.770 --> 02:51:55.004
THINK I THINK THE COUNTIES AND I

02:51:55.071 --> 02:51:55.838
ARE GOING TO. WE'RE GOING TO SEE

02:51:55.905 --> 02:51:57.140
EACH OTHER A WHOLE LOT THIS THIS

02:51:57.206 --> 02:51:58.775
COMING YEAR. ABOUT HOW THIS

02:51:58.841 --> 02:52:01.577
MONEY IS BEING SPENT. I THINK

02:52:01.644 --> 02:52:03.446
THE IDEA I HAVE BEING- PERHAPS

02:52:03.513 --> 02:52:05.181
IMAGES A AND TOTALING AND THAT

02:52:05.248 --> 02:52:06.849
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE LOOK AT ALL

02:52:06.916 --> 02:52:08.351
THOSE STEP DOWNS AND- I DID A

02:52:08.418 --> 02:52:10.119
PIECE OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR

02:52:10.186 --> 02:52:10.820
FOR SIXTY FIVE THAT WHAT WE

02:52:10.887 --> 02:52:12.922
REALLY LOOK. AT AND WHERE ALL OF

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:15.258
THAT BUT BUDGET MONEY IS GOING-

02:52:15.324 --> 02:52:17.126
BECAUSE WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION

02:52:17.193 --> 02:52:20.029
POINT I THINK IN OUR SOCIETY- IN

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.864
OUR- IN OUR CARE OF PEOPLE IN

02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:23.433
OUR POLITICS AND- EVERYTHING AND

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:25.768
IT'S- I THINK. INCUMBENT UPON US

02:52:25.835 --> 02:52:27.670
TO REALLY GET THIS RIGHT. AGAIN

02:52:27.737 --> 02:52:28.638

02:52:28.705 --> 02:52:30.473
AMOUNT OF MONEY LET US ALL

PLEASE USE IT TO THE BEST OF OUR

02:52:31.974 --> 02:52:36.212
ABILITY TO HELP AS. MANY PEOPLE.

MISIDENTIFIED EARLIER TODAY BY

02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:53.329
SOMEBODY SO IT CONTINUES RIGHT

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:54.897
UP TO THE RIGHT UP TO THE MOMENT

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:57.166

BUT- JUST APPRECIATE APPRECIATE

02:52:58.868 --> 02:53:00.570
VERY MUCH THE APPROACH THIS

02:53:00.636 --> 02:53:02.538
AUDIT HAS LED TO LEGISLATION

02:53:02.605 --> 02:53:04.941
WHICH I BELIEVE HAS HAS IS HAS

02:53:05.007 --> 02:53:07.310
AND IS. AND WILL MAKE

02:53:07.376 --> 02:53:10.980
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE SYSTEM BUT-

02:53:11.047 --> 02:53:12.949
OBVIOUSLY. OBVIOUSLY WE HEAR IT

02:53:13.015 --> 02:53:14.217
FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THE

02:53:14.283 --> 02:53:16.152
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND-

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:19.655
AND- AND IT IT AND SOME OF THESE

02:53:19.722 --> 02:53:21.724
PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE MORE SAY SEE

02:53:24.961 --> 02:53:26.429
PART OF IT FROM I'LL KEEP COMING

02:53:26.496 --> 02:53:28.197
BACK TO THIS IS THE SORT OF. THE

02:53:28.264 --> 02:53:29.098
FEELING OF A LACK OF

02:53:29.165 --> 02:53:32.001
COORDINATION- THROUGH THIS AND-

02:53:32.068 --> 02:53:34.270
SOMEBODY I DON'T CARE WHO AND

02:53:34.337 --> 02:53:35.972
WHY DO CARE OF ACTUALLY ABOUT.

02:53:36.038 --> 02:53:37.373
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE IN YOU KNOW

02:53:37.440 --> 02:53:39.375
OR SOME ENTITY WHETHER IT'S A

02:53:39.442 --> 02:53:41.644
COMMISSION OR WHATEVER NEEDS TO

02:53:41.711 --> 02:53:45.615
BE- MORE ACTIVELY- ENGAGED IN A

02:53:45.681 --> 02:53:48.217
LEADERSHIP LEVEL- TO. TO HELP

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:49.318

02:53:49.385 --> 02:53:51.587
PROBLEMS. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE

02:53:51.654 --> 02:53:53.356

SOME OF THEM WITH SEVERE MENTAL

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:23.606
HEALTH DISABILITIES I ALSO

02:56:23.673 --> 02:56:26.676
ASSISTED. PEOPLE WHO BEEN- WHO

02:56:26.742 --> 02:56:28.577
HAVE BEEN PUT ON HOLD ONE OF

02:56:28.644 --> 02:56:30.079
THEM IN PARTICULAR THAT I'M

02:56:30.146 --> 02:56:33.115
THINKING OF- THE AUDITORY

02:56:33.182 --> 02:56:35.051
HALLUCINATIONS CAUSED THEM TO.

02:56:35.117 --> 02:56:36.619
COMMIT ASSAULTIVE AND VIOLENT

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:39.188
BEHAVIORS- BUT MOST OF THE

02:56:39.255 --> 02:56:40.890
PEOPLE THAT I'VE WORKED WITH.

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:42.058
EVEN THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL

02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:44.393
HEALTH DISABILITIES WHO WERE NOT

NECESSARILY MED COMPLIANT I

02:56:46.729 --> 02:56:47.363
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND

02:56:47.430 --> 02:56:49.498
CONSERVATORSHIP FOR THOSE FOLKS

02:56:49.565 --> 02:56:50.533
ARE WOULDN'T THINKING

02:56:50.599 --> 02:56:52.601
CONSERVATORSHIP WAS APPROPRIATE.

02:56:52.668 --> 02:56:54.103
THERE'S SO MANY REASONS WHY

02:56:54.170 --> 02:56:56.305
PEOPLE ARE REPEAT- USING

02:56:56.372 --> 02:56:58.274
HOSPITALS- AND REPEAT

02:56:58.341 --> 02:57:00.509
HOSPITALIZATIONS SOME OF THEM

02:57:00.576 --> 02:57:02.745
ARE BECAUSE WHEN THE FOLKS ARE

02:57:02.812 --> 02:57:05.147
PUT ON A FIFTY ONE FIFTY SEVENTY

02:57:05.214 --> 02:57:08.150
TWO HOUR HOLD. OFTENTIMES THAT.

02:57:08.217 --> 02:57:10.720
BIG BABY FEEL BETTER THAN THEY

02:57:10.786 --> 02:57:12.588
DID WHEN THEY WERE PUT ON HOLD

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:14.190
BUT IT REALLY WASN'T EFFECTIVE

02:57:14.256 --> 02:57:15.825
IN TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING

02:57:15.891 --> 02:57:17.493
ISSUES AND SOME OTHER

02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:18.227
PARTICIPANTS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT

02:57:18.294 --> 02:57:22.798
THAT- WHAT A LARGER ISSUE I

02:57:22.865 --> 02:57:24.367
THINK IS. IN THE IDEA OF

02:57:24.433 --> 02:57:27.203
EXPANDING L. P. S. WHERE IS THE

02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:29.071
INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IS THE

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:31.841
STAFFING. PEOPLE HAVE MANY KINDS

02:57:31.907 --> 02:57:34.944
OF IDEAS A POLICY BUT FRANKLY

02:57:35.011 --> 02:57:36.178
WE'RE FACING THE GREAT

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:38.314
RESIGNATION WITH IN MENTAL

02:57:38.381 --> 02:57:40.883
HEALTH SERVICES- ARE LEAVING

02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:43.052
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE

02:57:43.119 --> 02:57:44.320
IT NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT BEING

02:57:44.387 --> 02:57:46.188
PAID ENOUGH BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:57:46.255 --> 02:57:48.090
FACING THEIR OLD MENTAL HEALTH

02:57:48.157 --> 02:57:50.693
CHALLENGES AND THEY'RE DEALING

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:52.561
WITH A VERY STRESSFUL JOB.

02:57:52.628 --> 02:57:55.164
INCREASING CASELOADS AND SO

02:57:55.231 --> 02:57:57.333
THERE ISN'T EVEN THE PROCESS IN

02:57:57.400 --> 02:57:59.769
TERMS OF WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO

02:57:59.835 --> 02:58:01.637
SERVE MANY OF THESE POPULATIONS

02:58:01.704 --> 02:58:04.407
I WORK IN SERVICE AREA FOR I

02:58:04.473 --> 02:58:06.809
HAD- WHICH IS WHERE IN LOS

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:11.480
ANGELES- WHICH IS SKIDROW CREEK

02:58:11.547 --> 02:58:15.051
TOWN NEED CITY- DOWNTOWN. AND

02:58:15.117 --> 02:58:16.886
YOU KNOW MY TEAM WAS ELEVEN

02:58:16.952 --> 02:58:18.954
PEOPLE AND NOW IT'S ONE THAT'S

02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:24.727
ME. SO HOW THEN ARE THOSE FOLKS

02:58:24.794 --> 02:58:26.495
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING

02:58:26.562 --> 02:58:28.197
THESE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE

02:58:28.264 --> 02:58:31.000
WANTING TO ROLL OUT IT'S NOT

02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:33.569
POSSIBLE I DON'T. I THINK THAT

02:58:33.636 --> 02:58:35.337
THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMMITTEE OF

02:58:35.404 --> 02:58:37.740
WORKERS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR

02:58:37.807 --> 02:58:41.010
REALLY MAKING THESE DECISIONS O

02:58:41.077 --> 02:58:43.012
REALLY AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID

02:58:43.079 --> 02:58:45.181
HAVE SOMETHING BE EFFECTIVE TO

02:58:45.247 --> 02:58:47.416
HELP PEOPLE NOT JUST HOUSING

02:58:47.483 --> 02:58:50.286
THEM OUR WAREHOUSING THEM- WHICH

02:58:50.352 --> 02:58:52.888
I FEAR IS SOME OF. NOT NECESSARY

02:58:52.955 --> 02:58:55.791
PEOPLE HERE BUT MY FEAR IS THAT

02:58:55.858 --> 02:58:56.826
IT'S LIKE WELL THERE'S A

02:58:56.892 --> 02:58:59.228
HOMELESS PROBLEM SOME OF THOSE

02:58:59.295 --> 02:59:00.429
PROBLEMS ARE MENTAL HEALTH SO

02:59:00.496 --> 02:59:02.932
WE'LL JUST. PUT PEOPLE SOMEWHERE

02:59:02.998 --> 02:59:04.133
AND REALLY WE WANT TO HEAL

02:59:04.200 --> 02:59:05.401
PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT TO JUST PUT

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:07.269
THEM SOMEWHERE WE DON'T JUST

02:59:07.336 --> 02:59:08.537
MAKE IT EASIER TO PUT PEOPLE

02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:10.406
SOMEWHERE WE WANT TO TAKE CARE

02:59:10.473 --> 02:59:13.209
OF THOSE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY ARE

02:59:13.275 --> 02:59:15.878
HEALING SO THAT THEY AREN'T JUST

02:59:15.945 --> 02:59:17.680
IN A CYCLE BUT THEY'RE GETTING

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:19.748
BETTER AND THAT MEANS. HAVING

02:59:19.815 --> 02:59:22.084
MORE WORKERS THAT MEANS THAT

02:59:22.151 --> 02:59:23.519
HAVING MORE STAFF THAT MEANS

02:59:23.586 --> 02:59:25.087
HAVING WORKERS WHO ARE

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:28.157
CULTURALLY COMPETENT. AND IN ALL

02:59:28.224 --> 02:59:30.326
LEVELS NOT JUST OUTREACH WORKERS

02:59:30.392 --> 02:59:31.327
BUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THESE

02:59:31.393 --> 02:59:34.263
HOSPITALS. AND FURTHERMORE A LOT

02:59:34.330 --> 02:59:36.365
OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE IN MY

02:59:36.432 --> 02:59:38.968
EXPERIENCE JUST CHARGED- SOON

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:41.170
BECAUSE THEY'RE LOW INCOME THEIR

02:59:41.237 --> 02:59:43.906
MEDIC CAL SO. FIRST SOME PRIVATE

02:59:43.973 --> 02:59:46.342
PLACES THEY WOULD RATHER JUST.

02:59:46.408 --> 02:59:48.811
DISCHARGED THEM- AND THEN THEY

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.179
JUST COME BACK THEY COME BACK IN

02:59:50.246 --> 02:59:51.447
A FEW DAYS AND AGAIN SOME OF

02:59:51.514 --> 02:59:53.682
THESE PEOPLE THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:59:53.749 --> 02:59:56.719
WHO HAVE USED HOSPITALS FIVE.

02:59:56.785 --> 03:00:00.022
TEN TIMES IN A YEAR MAYBE MORE-

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:01.457
BUT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY NEED

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:03.726
CONSERVATORSHIP THEY NEED A MORE

03:00:03.792 --> 03:00:06.128
ROBUST AND HOLISTIC APPROACH

03:00:06.195 --> 03:00:07.997
WHICH MEANS MORE WORKERS WHICH

03:00:08.063 --> 03:00:10.766
MEANS. LESS CASELOADS WHICH

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:11.934
MEANS THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY

03:00:12.001 --> 03:00:14.136
ABLE TO GIVE THE CARE AND

03:00:14.203 --> 03:00:15.971
COMPASSION THAT THEY HAVE. THE

03:00:16.038 --> 03:00:17.740
COWORKERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH

03:00:17.806 --> 03:00:20.309
ARE INCREDIBLY CONTENT AND

03:00:20.376 --> 03:00:22.478
UNDERSTANDING AND GO THE EXTRA

03:00:22.545 --> 03:00:24.513
MILE FOR OUR CLIENTS BECAUSE

03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:26.182
THEY CARE. BUT THEY'RE PUSHED

03:00:26.248 --> 03:00:29.919
OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE EXHAUSTED.

03:00:29.985 --> 03:00:30.920
AND IT PUSHED OUT BECAUSE THERE

03:00:30.986 --> 03:00:33.656
ISN'T ENOUGH CAPACITY AND PLACES

03:00:33.722 --> 03:00:36.125
THAT EXIST THAT NEED TO REALLY.

03:00:36.192 --> 03:00:37.393
SERVE THE NEEDS OF THOSE

03:00:37.459 --> 03:00:39.595
COMMUNITIES- AND SERVE THE NEEDS

03:00:39.662 --> 03:00:40.863
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THOSE

03:00:40.930 --> 03:00:43.265
COMMUNITIES. CONSERVATORSHIP

03:00:43.332 --> 03:00:46.101
IT'S NOT A NOT A CATCH ALL. OF

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:48.904
ME AND TO CONSERVE PEOPLE REALLY

03:00:48.971 --> 03:00:51.340
HAVE TO MEAN THAT THOSE PEOPLE

03:00:51.407 --> 03:00:54.043
ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND

03:00:54.109 --> 03:00:57.546
INCREDIBLY- GREGIS WAY- THAT

03:00:57.613 --> 03:00:59.014
THEY COULD POSSIBLY LOSE THEIR

03:00:59.081 --> 03:01:01.317
LIVES AND IF. THEY'RE GOING TO

03:01:01.383 --> 03:01:02.952
BE PUT IN THE FACILITY IT NEEDS

03:01:03.018 --> 03:01:05.087
TO BE A FACILITY THAT'S CARING

03:01:05.154 --> 03:01:06.322
AND COMPASSIONATE AND THAT MEANS

03:01:06.388 --> 03:01:08.123
PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWORKED THAT

03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:10.092
MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE PAID OFF

03:01:10.159 --> 03:01:11.460
THAT MEANS PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO

03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:13.429
TAKING CARE. AND UNDERSTAND THE

03:01:13.495 --> 03:01:15.531
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY SO I

03:01:15.598 --> 03:01:17.099
WANTED TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT I

03:01:17.166 --> 03:01:18.968
APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE THINGS

03:01:19.034 --> 03:01:20.603
PEOPLE SAID MANY OF THOSE I.

03:01:20.669 --> 03:01:23.105
WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH- JUST

03:01:23.172 --> 03:01:25.708
LASTLY THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE NOT

03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:27.876
HAVING HOMES- HOME BECAUSE

03:01:27.943 --> 03:01:29.011
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE USE THE

03:01:29.078 --> 03:01:32.014
TERM HOMELESS IT CAN SEEM.

03:01:32.081 --> 03:01:33.849
INHUMANE JUST LIKE THIS IS A

03:01:33.916 --> 03:01:35.284
PROBLEM RATHER THAN THESE ARE

03:01:35.351 --> 03:01:37.253
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ISSUES THAT

03:01:37.319 --> 03:01:39.221
NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND

03:01:39.288 --> 03:01:41.490
ADDRESSED. ALL RIGHT THE OTHER

03:01:41.557 --> 03:01:43.859
ISSUE REALLY IS HOUSING AND

03:01:43.926 --> 03:01:45.327
HOUSING P. AND PEOPLE HAVING

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:47.196
HOUSING AND BEING ABLE TO AFFORD

03:01:47.263 --> 03:01:49.131
WHERE THEY LIVE. IF THAT ISN'T

03:01:49.198 --> 03:01:52.001
ADDRESS THEN THERE WILL BE MORE

03:01:52.067 --> 03:01:52.868

DRAMATIC ENTRY INTO OUR SYSTEM

03:09:47.776 --> 03:09:50.378

THEY RELATE TO LPS. OUR

03:18:35.570 --> 03:18:37.372
UNDERSTANDING FOR MENTAL ILLNESS

03:18:37.438 --> 03:18:38.706
AND ITS TREATMENT HAS ADVANCED

03:18:38.773 --> 03:18:40.308
DRAMATICALLY SINCE THE LPS

03:18:40.375 --> 03:18:42.010
BECAME OPERATIVE. WE HAVE

03:18:42.076 --> 03:18:43.911
LEARNED THAT MENTAL ILLNESSES

03:18:43.978 --> 03:18:45.947
LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR

03:18:46.014 --> 03:18:47.849
DISORDER. OR ILLNESSES OF THE

03:18:47.915 --> 03:18:50.518
BRAIN. AND IN THAT RESPECT THERE

03:18:50.585 --> 03:18:52.120
ARE NO DIFFERENT FROM MEDICAL

03:18:52.186 --> 03:18:54.088
DISORDERS AFFECTING OTHER ORGAN

03:18:54.155 --> 03:18:56.858
SYSTEMS. HOWEVER WHAT EVIDENCE

03:18:56.924 --> 03:18:58.660
BASED TREATMENTS HAVE ADVANCED

03:18:58.726 --> 03:19:00.828
SIGNIFICANTLY PSYCHOSIS AS

03:19:00.895 --> 03:19:01.996
EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE WITH

03:19:02.063 --> 03:19:04.032
MENTAL ILLNESS IS STILL VERY

03:19:04.098 --> 03:19:06.467
PAINFUL AND FRIGHTENING. IMAGINE

03:19:06.534 --> 03:19:07.702
TRYING TO FUNCTION IN DOING YOUR

03:19:07.769 --> 03:19:10.371
WORK IF YOU BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE

03:19:10.438 --> 03:19:12.173
CONSTANTLY TRYING TO KILL YOU.

03:19:12.240 --> 03:19:14.342
IMAGINE BEING SO HUNGRY BECAUSE

03:19:14.409 --> 03:19:16.811
YOU HAVEN'T EATEN DAIS. BUT YOU

03:19:16.878 --> 03:19:18.913
DON'T TRUST THE FOOD IN FRONT OF

03:19:18.980 --> 03:19:19.514
YOU BECAUSE YOU THINK IT MIGHT

03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:21.816
BE POISONED. IMAGINE HEARING

03:19:21.883 --> 03:19:23.418
VOICES SO LOUD THAT YOU CANNOT

03:19:23.484 --> 03:19:26.921
SLEEP. IT'S NOT PLEASANT AND

03:19:26.988 --> 03:19:30.224
IT'S VERY DISTRESSING. THERE'S

03:19:30.291 --> 03:19:32.026
ANOTHER DIMENSION OF PSYCHOSIS

03:19:32.093 --> 03:19:33.828
THAT DIFFERS FROM OTHER MEDICAL

03:19:33.895 --> 03:19:36.130
DISORDERS MENTAL CAPACITY MENTAL

03:19:36.197 --> 03:19:38.766
ILLNESS ROB SAYS ABOUT OUR

03:19:38.833 --> 03:19:41.836
ECONOMY AND ABILITY TO KNOW REAL

03:19:41.903 --> 03:19:44.472
FROM NOT REAL. HEART DISEASE BY

03:19:44.539 --> 03:19:46.407
CONTRAST DOESN'T ROUTINELY

03:19:46.474 --> 03:19:47.675
AFFECT ONE'S ABILITY TO MAKE

03:19:47.742 --> 03:19:49.711
INFORMED DECISIONS A HEART

03:19:49.777 --> 03:19:51.813
ATTACK IS VERY APPARENT YOU WANT

03:19:51.879 --> 03:19:54.015
HELPING YOU WANT NOW NO ONE

03:19:54.082 --> 03:19:55.717
DOUBTS OR QUESTIONS YOU NEED FOR

03:19:55.783 --> 03:19:58.119
TREATMENT AND NO ONE BRINGS INTO

03:19:58.186 --> 03:20:00.121
AN NSF TO DECISION MAKER OR

03:20:00.188 --> 03:20:01.989
NEEDS A COURT ORDER. IN MENTAL

03:20:02.056 --> 03:20:03.858
ILLNESS HOWEVER THE PERSON'S

03:20:03.925 --> 03:20:06.961
ABILITY TO EXERCISE INSIGHT IS

03:20:07.028 --> 03:20:08.529
IMPAIRED THE ABILITY TO

03:20:08.596 --> 03:20:10.031
RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR MIND IS

03:20:10.098 --> 03:20:11.499
CONTROLLED BY DELUSIONS OR

03:20:11.566 --> 03:20:14.669
HALLUCINATIONS IS LACKING IN THE

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:16.537
IMPULSE TO SEEK OUT HELP IS

03:20:16.604 --> 03:20:19.540
DIMINISHED. OR ALTOGETHER ABSENT

03:20:19.607 --> 03:20:23.077
THE INDIVIDUAL OFTEN BELIEVE

03:20:23.144 --> 03:20:23.711
THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THEM

03:20:23.778 --> 03:20:25.179
. THEY DISTRUST OTHERS THEY END

03:20:25.246 --> 03:20:27.081
UP DISTRUSTING MEDICATIONS NOT

03:20:27.148 --> 03:20:28.950
ONLY PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATION BUT

03:20:29.016 --> 03:20:31.185
LIFESAVING ONES THE ONES THAT

03:20:31.252 --> 03:20:33.454
THEY NEED TO TREAT A COLD DURING

03:20:33.521 --> 03:20:35.857
OUR CONDITION OR DIABETES. THESE

03:20:35.923 --> 03:20:36.824
INDIVIDUALS ARE GRAVELY

03:20:36.891 --> 03:20:40.461
DISABLED. AND THAT'S TRAGIC. LPS

03:20:40.528 --> 03:20:42.864
OPENS THE DOOR TO EVALUATE. AND

03:20:42.930 --> 03:20:45.400
DIAGNOSE PATIENTS LPS ALLOWS

03:20:45.466 --> 03:20:47.869
PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AN

03:20:47.935 --> 03:20:49.604
OPPORTUNITY PER TREATMENT. BUT

03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:50.972
WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY SLACKING

03:20:51.038 --> 03:20:52.807
THERE IS A SERIOUS RISK OF HARM

03:20:52.874 --> 03:20:54.108
TO THE PATIENT. WHEN THE

03:20:54.175 --> 03:20:55.443
CAPACITY TO MAKE INFORMED

03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:57.545
DECISIONS IS IMPAIR THE LPS

03:20:57.612 --> 03:20:58.813
PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK OF

03:20:58.880 --> 03:20:59.947
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

03:21:00.014 --> 03:21:01.582
MEDICAL PROVIDER AND THE COURT

03:21:01.649 --> 03:21:03.684
IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT INFORMED

03:21:03.751 --> 03:21:05.853
DECISION ON BEHALF OF THE

03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:07.688
PATIENT'S WELFARE IS MADE.

03:21:07.755 --> 03:21:08.923
HOWEVER THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH

03:21:08.990 --> 03:21:10.124
THIS BECAUSE TREATMENT ON A

03:21:10.191 --> 03:21:12.593
ROUTINE BASIS. IS DELAYED OR

03:21:12.660 --> 03:21:15.129
WORSE THE NIGHT. DATA SUGGESTS

03:21:15.196 --> 03:21:16.898
THAT THAT IF WE TREAT PSYCHOSIS

03:21:16.964 --> 03:21:19.467
EARLY ON. WE CAN DRAMATICALLY

03:21:19.534 --> 03:21:21.569
SHORTEN ACUTE EPISODES. WHEN

03:21:21.636 --> 03:21:23.070
TREATMENTS PROVIDED CONSISTENTLY

03:21:23.137 --> 03:21:26.207
OVER TIME WE OPTIMIZED EVENTUAL

03:21:26.274 --> 03:21:28.309
OUTCOME. UNFORTUNATELY THAT TIME

03:21:28.376 --> 03:21:30.912
THAT ELAPSED BETWEEN A FIFTY ONE

03:21:30.978 --> 03:21:31.446
FIFTY THE TENSION IN THE

03:21:31.512 --> 03:21:32.814
COMMUNITY IN BEING ABLE TO

03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:34.248
PROVIDE TREATMENT IN AN

03:21:34.315 --> 03:21:36.017
INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY.

03:21:36.083 --> 03:21:38.653
CAN ON AVERAGE BE SEVEN DAYS OR

03:21:38.719 --> 03:21:40.087
LONGER FOR A PATIENT REFUSING

03:21:40.154 --> 03:21:42.890
TREATMENT. WE ARE EFFECTIVELY

03:21:42.957 --> 03:21:44.091
DETAINING PATIENTS BUT NOT

03:21:44.158 --> 03:21:46.494
TREATING THEM. FOR PATIENTS

03:21:46.561 --> 03:21:49.897
REFUSING TREATMENT LPS PROVIDES

03:21:49.964 --> 03:21:50.498
A COURT PROCEDURE CALLED HERE

03:21:50.565 --> 03:21:52.500
REACHED HEARING. A RESPECT ISSUE

03:21:52.567 --> 03:21:53.901
IF THE COURT PROCEDURE TO

03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.236
EVALUATE THE PATIENT'S CAPACITY

03:21:55.303 --> 03:21:57.338
TO UNDERSTAND HER ILLNESS AND

03:21:57.405 --> 03:21:58.406
THEIR CAPACITY TO CONSENT TO

03:21:58.473 --> 03:22:00.308
TREATMENT. IN THEORY THIS IS

03:22:00.374 --> 03:22:04.378
FINE THERE IS A BALANCING ACT

03:22:04.445 --> 03:22:04.946
BETWEEN LEGAL AND TREATMENT

03:22:05.012 --> 03:22:07.048
NEEDS. AND SECOND PSYCHIATRIST

03:22:07.114 --> 03:22:09.317
UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT THIS VERY

03:22:09.383 --> 03:22:10.952
WELL BUT IN PRACTICE IS THE

03:22:11.018 --> 03:22:12.787
PROCESS IS COMPLICATED AND IN

03:22:12.854 --> 03:22:14.388
SOME SENSE SOMETIMES BAD THINGS

03:22:14.455 --> 03:22:16.757
HAPPEN. RECENT POSITIONS ARE

03:22:16.824 --> 03:22:18.926
LINKED TO LPS TO PAYMENT SO THAT

03:22:18.993 --> 03:22:20.661
SOMEONE IS CURRENTLY ON. ONCE

03:22:20.728 --> 03:22:21.762
THE COURT APPROVED THE

03:22:21.829 --> 03:22:23.698
INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT

03:22:23.764 --> 03:22:25.867
INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT ONLY LAST

03:22:25.933 --> 03:22:28.236
UNTIL THE END OF THAT WHOLE.

03:22:28.302 --> 03:22:30.338
ONCE THE CURRENT HOLD EXPIRES

03:22:30.404 --> 03:22:32.573
AND IF THE PATIENT IS STILL ILL.

03:22:32.640 --> 03:22:33.608
ANOTHER CAPACITY HEARINGS

03:22:33.674 --> 03:22:35.910
REQUIRED IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL

03:22:35.977 --> 03:22:37.612
THAT CAPACITY HEARING IS ONCE

03:22:37.678 --> 03:22:39.847
AGAIN HURT. THE TREATMENT THAT

03:22:39.914 --> 03:22:41.682
WAS APPROVED INITIALLY BY THE

03:22:41.749 --> 03:22:44.051
COURT IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE. AND

03:22:44.118 --> 03:22:45.953
RISKS ACUTE DECOMPENSATION OF

03:22:46.020 --> 03:22:48.589
THE PATIENT. THIS IS A REAL

03:22:48.656 --> 03:22:51.092
PROBLEM. LET'S GO BACK THE

03:22:51.158 --> 03:22:52.660
INITIAL ONE WEEK DELAY PRIOR TO

03:22:52.727 --> 03:22:54.529
TREATMENT CAN BE VERY COSTLY.

03:22:54.595 --> 03:22:55.963
NOT ONLY FROM A FINANCIAL

03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:58.065
STANDPOINT AS THE PATIENT IS IN

03:22:58.132 --> 03:22:59.634
THE HOSPITAL LONGER THAN THEY

03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:01.469
OTHERWISE MIGHT NEED TO BE. BUT

03:23:01.536 --> 03:23:03.170
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S COSTLY

03:23:03.237 --> 03:23:04.005
FROM A PATIENT'S FUNCTIONALITY

03:23:04.071 --> 03:23:06.107
STANDPOINT. DURING THAT ONE

03:23:06.173 --> 03:23:08.509
WEEK. I'VE SEEN PATIENTS END UP

03:23:08.576 --> 03:23:10.845
HURTING THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE

03:23:10.912 --> 03:23:11.479
VOICES ARE TELLING THEM TO KILL

03:23:11.546 --> 03:23:13.514
THEMSELVES. THREE THAT ONE WEEK

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:15.616
I'VE SEEN PATIENTS HURT OTHERS

03:23:15.683 --> 03:23:16.918
BECAUSE OF THEIR PARANOIA.

03:23:16.984 --> 03:23:19.353
BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IT TAKES A

03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:19.987
MUCH LONGER TO GET BACK TO THE

03:23:20.054 --> 03:23:22.623
BASELINE. DATA TELLS US THAT THE

03:23:22.690 --> 03:23:23.824
LONGER THAN THREE MINUTES THE

03:23:23.891 --> 03:23:25.526
LATE THE LONGER IT TAKES TO GET

03:23:25.593 --> 03:23:27.361
BACK TO THE WAY YOU WERE BEFORE

03:23:27.428 --> 03:23:29.664
YOU GOT SICK. SO THE PATIENT

03:23:29.730 --> 03:23:31.532
LOSES MORE TIME OFF FROM WORK.

03:23:31.599 --> 03:23:33.267
EMPLOYER IS AFFECTED BY THE LOSS

03:23:33.334 --> 03:23:36.304
OF THEIR WORKERS. THE PATIENT

03:23:36.370 --> 03:23:36.938
AND THEIR FAMILY ARE DRASTICALLY

03:23:37.004 --> 03:23:39.974
AFFECTED. THE LPS ACT MADE US

03:23:40.041 --> 03:23:41.642
AWARE THAT PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS

03:23:41.709 --> 03:23:42.910
ARE DEVASTATING HIS ORDERS THAT

03:23:42.977 --> 03:23:44.845
REQUIRE TREATMENT. IN A SYSTEM

03:23:44.912 --> 03:23:45.813
THAT PROTECTS BOTH AND

03:23:45.880 --> 03:23:48.783
INDIVIDUALS RIGHTS AND ALSO THE

03:23:48.849 --> 03:23:51.285
RIGHT TO BE TREATED. WELL TAKING

TREAT DURING THE ACUTE STAGE OF

03:24:00.494 --> 03:24:01.963
THAT THIS ORDER ONCE THE

03:24:02.029 --> 03:24:04.298
DIAGNOSIS IS MADE. TREATMENT OF

03:24:04.365 --> 03:24:05.666
PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS AND OTHER

03:24:05.733 --> 03:24:07.768
MENTAL DISEASES SHOULD ALIGN

03:24:07.835 --> 03:24:10.705
WITH THIS OR SHOULD AT MOST BE

SAN JOSE- I CAN ATTEST THAT.

03:25:55.209 --> 03:25:58.145
EACH COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN WAYS

03:25:58.212 --> 03:26:00.781
OF DOING THINGS- SOME GOOD SOME

03:26:00.848 --> 03:26:03.217
BAD- I DON'T KNOW IF COUNTIES

03:26:03.284 --> 03:26:04.819
ARE COLLABORATING WITH THEIR

03:26:04.885 --> 03:26:08.189
SUCCESSES AND FAILURES- BUT IF

03:26:08.255 --> 03:26:10.391
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING I. I WOULD

03:26:10.458 --> 03:26:12.460
CERTAINLY HOPE- THROUGH THIS

03:26:12.526 --> 03:26:13.627
COMMITTEE THEN THEY WE WOULD

03:26:13.694 --> 03:26:15.296

SPOKEN ABOUT- SO FAR TODAY-

03:26:24.505 --> 03:26:25.940
BEFORE I TALK ABOUT EXACT

03:26:26.006 --> 03:26:28.976

INSIGHTS AND SHE MADE A LOT OF

03:26:37.418 --> 03:26:42.823
BALLOT IN THE- GREAT POINTS- SO

03:26:42.890 --> 03:26:45.793
BEFORE I GET INTO THAT I WOULD

03:26:45.860 --> 03:26:47.161
HOPE THAT. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

03:26:47.228 --> 03:26:49.563
THAT WHEN NINE ONE ONE IS CALLED

03:26:49.630 --> 03:26:51.832
WE- THE SYSTEM IS OBVIOUSLY

03:26:51.899 --> 03:26:54.235
FAILED THESE INDIVIDUALS. THAT

03:26:54.301 --> 03:26:57.471
ARE A CRISIS. LONG BEFORE WE

03:26:57.538 --> 03:27:00.207
SHOW UP AND SO. THAT IS SYSTEMS

03:27:00.274 --> 03:27:01.642
NEED TO BE REVAMPED EVERY LOOK

03:27:01.709 --> 03:27:04.178
THAT- EVERYTHING SHOULD BE BUILT

03:27:04.245 --> 03:27:06.580
I THINK BACK UP FROM THE BOTTOM-

03:27:06.647 --> 03:27:09.216
BECAUSE- WE'RE BEING CALLED OUT

03:27:09.283 --> 03:27:11.685
TO THESE CALLS. YEAH LIKE I SAID

03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:14.922
THAT THE CRISIS IS WAY BEYOND-

03:27:14.989 --> 03:27:17.525
WHAT THE SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED.

03:27:17.591 --> 03:27:20.427
THEM AND LIKE I SAID WAIT WHAT

03:27:20.494 --> 03:27:22.096
WHETHER IT'S FUNDING OR- WHETHER

03:27:22.163 --> 03:27:25.032
IT'S ENOUGH STAFFING IS UP FOR

- I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF

03:27:30.771 --> 03:27:34.441
THAT I'VE BEEN IN. FOUR EIGHT

03:27:34.508 --> 03:27:37.211
EIGHT INDIVIDUAL THAT. OBVIOUSLY

03:27:37.278 --> 03:27:40.314
IS SYSTEM HASN'T- ALLOW THEM TO

03:27:40.381 --> 03:27:43.317

03:27:43.384 --> 03:27:46.187
TO A CALL TWO EIGHT MIDDLE AGED

03:27:46.253 --> 03:27:48.722
LADY WHO WAS. ARE FOUND IN A

03:27:48.789 --> 03:27:50.925
DUMPSTER AND SHE'S BASICALLY

03:27:50.991 --> 03:27:53.093
LIVING HER DAYS IN A DUMPSTER

03:27:53.160 --> 03:27:54.662
AND HOW MANY DAYS SHE WAS THERE

03:27:54.728 --> 03:27:57.164
IS UNKNOWN BUT WE'RE CALLED OUT

03:27:57.231 --> 03:27:59.066
TO THIS AND TO RESPOND TO THAT.

03:27:59.133 --> 03:28:01.669
SHE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEET AN

03:28:01.735 --> 03:28:04.305
INJURY. THAT WE GENERALLY SEE

03:28:04.371 --> 03:28:07.208
FROM- A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT OR A

03:28:07.274 --> 03:28:09.043
HEART ATTACK IS AS WAS SAID

03:28:09.109 --> 03:28:12.379
EARLIER. AND SO DEALING WITH AN

03:28:12.446 --> 03:28:14.782
INDIVIDUAL LIKE THAT. IS A

03:28:14.849 --> 03:28:16.784
SENSITIVE MATTER- THE MATTER HOW

03:28:16.851 --> 03:28:18.719
YOU LOOK AT IT BUT GETTING AN

03:28:18.786 --> 03:28:20.888
INDIVIDUAL OUT OF A DUMPSTER WHO

03:28:20.955 --> 03:28:23.290
IS HAVING A CRISIS AND TRYING TO

03:28:23.357 --> 03:28:25.392
NAVIGATE THAT WITH THE GENERAL

03:28:25.459 --> 03:28:28.028
PUBLIC. ALL WATCHING WITH CELL

03:28:28.095 --> 03:28:30.130
PHONES AND HAVING THEIR OPINIONS

03:28:30.197 --> 03:28:32.933
AND- HOW TO DO THAT IS A IT'S A

03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.369
DELICATE MATTER AND HOW SHE GOT

03:28:35.436 --> 03:28:37.605
THERE IS THE TRAGIC PART OF ALL

03:28:37.671 --> 03:28:39.907
OF IT- AND THE SYSTEM IS

03:28:39.974 --> 03:28:42.109
OBVIOUSLY FAILED HER. AS WE

03:28:42.176 --> 03:28:45.946
REMOVE HER FROM THE DUMPSTER-

03:28:46.013 --> 03:28:48.849
AND- WHAT HE OUR SYSTEM IS WE

03:28:48.916 --> 03:28:50.584
ARE NOT A TRANSPORTING AGENCY

03:28:50.651 --> 03:28:51.886
HERE IN SAN JOSE SO WE TRANSFER

03:28:51.952 --> 03:28:54.588
THE CARE TO AN AMBULANCE. AND

03:28:54.655 --> 03:28:56.891
UPON ARRIVAL OF AN AMBULANCE WE

03:28:56.957 --> 03:28:58.959
EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON IF SHE

03:28:59.026 --> 03:29:00.227
DOESN'T HAVE ANY OBVIOUS

03:29:00.294 --> 03:29:02.296
INJURIES AND SHE CAN ANSWER THE

03:29:02.363 --> 03:29:06.934
FOUR QUESTIONS. THAT WE ASK.

03:29:07.001 --> 03:29:08.502
THAT SOMETIMES. A FIFTY ONE

03:29:08.569 --> 03:29:12.640
FIFTY HOLD. IS WHAT WE HAVE TO

03:29:12.706 --> 03:29:15.709
DO IN THIS MOMENT BUT I I'D LIKE

03:29:15.776 --> 03:29:16.744
TO ECHO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

03:29:16.810 --> 03:29:18.479
OTHER PEOPLE SAID THAT IS NOT

03:29:18.545 --> 03:29:26.353
NECESSARILY- THE NEED AND- SO WE

03:29:26.420 --> 03:29:28.389
TRANSPORT THEM TO THE AMBULANCE

03:29:28.455 --> 03:29:30.424
THE AMBULANCE THEN BRING HIM TO

03:29:30.491 --> 03:29:32.393
THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND AGAIN AND

03:29:32.459 --> 03:29:33.727
AGAIN THIS HAPPENS OVER AND OVER

03:29:33.794 --> 03:29:35.663
IN EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY AND

03:29:35.729 --> 03:29:38.265
THE STATE CALIFORNIA AND ER'S

03:29:38.332 --> 03:29:42.369
BECOME. OVER BURDENED WITH WITH

03:29:42.436 --> 03:29:43.504
PEOPLE HAVING MENTAL ILLNESS

03:29:43.570 --> 03:29:45.506
CRISIS IS AN ISIS SEEMS THAT'S

03:29:45.572 --> 03:29:47.241
THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE AND

03:29:47.308 --> 03:29:49.310
THAT'S THE SYSTEM WE USE DOESN'T

03:29:49.376 --> 03:29:51.845
SEEM VERY EFFECTIVE AND TO GO

03:29:51.912 --> 03:29:55.349
FULL CIRCLE IT WAS PROBABLY

03:29:55.416 --> 03:29:56.083
TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN HOURS

03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:59.920
AFTER- WE WERE ABLE TO. GET THE

03:29:59.987 --> 03:30:02.089
PATIENT TO GO IN THE M. S. ONE

03:30:02.156 --> 03:30:02.690
SHE WAS RIGHT BACK OUT ON THE

03:30:02.756 --> 03:30:06.860
STREET- AND SO- SOMEBODY IN THE

03:30:06.927 --> 03:30:08.662
HOSPITAL'S DETERMINED YOU KNOW

03:30:08.729 --> 03:30:10.464
WE ARE ON THE FIRE DEPARTMENT

03:30:10.531 --> 03:30:12.199
SIDE OF IT AREN'T. REALLY

03:30:12.266 --> 03:30:14.168
TRIBUTE TO THE PROCESS ONCE WE

03:30:14.234 --> 03:30:16.704
TRANSFER THE CARE. BUT WE SEE

03:30:16.770 --> 03:30:18.672
THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WITH

03:30:18.739 --> 03:30:21.342
THE SAME. PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME

03:30:21.408 --> 03:30:23.477
TYPE CRISIS IS AND THEN IT. IT

03:30:23.544 --> 03:30:25.312
USUALLY PROGRESSES TO THE WORST

03:30:25.379 --> 03:30:27.047
CASE SCENARIO WHERE THE PATIENT

03:30:27.114 --> 03:30:28.916
IS NO LONGER HAVING A CRISIS

03:30:28.983 --> 03:30:30.684
THEY ARM THEMSELVES IN A WAY

03:30:30.751 --> 03:30:33.487
THAT. THEY DON'T COME BACK FROM-

03:30:33.554 --> 03:30:35.222
BUT I ALSO LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

03:30:35.289 --> 03:30:37.191
MEDIA- D. A. A CALL WHERE THE

03:30:37.257 --> 03:30:41.095
SYSTEM. DIDN'T WORK AND THE

03:30:41.161 --> 03:30:41.729
FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD WAS PUT ON

03:30:41.795 --> 03:30:45.199
THEM. FOR THEIR FOR THEIR NEEDS-

03:30:45.265 --> 03:30:48.602
FOR HAVING ANXIETY ISSUES AND WE

03:30:48.669 --> 03:30:50.738
DID GET SOME FOLLOW UP IF THE

03:30:50.804 --> 03:30:52.840
SYSTEM DOES WORK AT TIMES- IT'S

03:30:52.906 --> 03:30:56.276
NOT ALL. DOOM AND GLOOM- BUT

03:30:56.343 --> 03:30:59.146
THERE IS A LOT OF. TRAGEDY AND

03:30:59.213 --> 03:31:00.881

OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN AT TIMES

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:53.033
BECAUSE WE DON'T. WHAT WERE WE

03:31:53.100 --> 03:31:54.768
ON THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM

03:31:54.835 --> 03:31:56.937
AREN'T PUTTING THEM INTO THE

03:31:57.004 --> 03:31:59.640
FACILITY OR DIRECTING THEM TO

03:31:59.706 --> 03:32:01.909
THE FACILITY- INSTEAD WE ARE

03:32:01.975 --> 03:32:03.477
JUST TRANSFERRED TO AN AMBULANCE

03:32:03.544 --> 03:32:04.878

BEST FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. AND

03:32:09.116 --> 03:32:10.284
I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD FIND

HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS BUT THE NINE

03:32:16.023 --> 03:32:16.824
ONE ONE SYSTEM AND HOW WE SHOULD

03:32:16.890 --> 03:32:18.659
BETTER SERVE THE INDIVIDUALS IN

CRISIS OTHER THAN. TRANSFERRING

03:32:21.095 --> 03:32:23.897
THEM TO- AN EMERGENCY ROOM AND-

03:32:23.964 --> 03:32:26.767
OVERWHELMING THOSE SYSTEMS SO

03:32:26.834 --> 03:32:28.001
HAVING A ROBUST MENTAL HEALTH

03:32:28.068 --> 03:32:29.937
SYSTEM- THAT SUPPORTS PATIENTS

03:32:30.003 --> 03:32:32.973
LONG. LONG BEFORE WE GET CALLED

03:32:33.040 --> 03:32:35.642
OUT THERE IS HOPEFULLY EIGHT

03:32:35.709 --> 03:32:37.611
EIGHT LARGE FOCUS AND THAT WE

03:32:37.678 --> 03:32:40.214
CAN BUILD A BETTER SYSTEM-

03:32:40.280 --> 03:32:42.282
BECAUSE- GETTING SOMEBODY THAT

03:32:42.349 --> 03:32:45.252

USING A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD IT

03:32:47.855 --> 03:32:49.923
SOMETIMES BECOMES EIGHT A GOTCHA

03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:52.826
SYSTEM WHERE INDIVIDUALS NOT

03:32:52.893 --> 03:32:53.861
REALLY TELLING US THEY WANT TO

03:32:53.927 --> 03:32:55.662

LEAPS AND BOUNDS. IN PART

03:44:32.225 --> 03:44:36.830
BECAUSE OF NUMEROUS. LAWS THAT

03:44:36.896 --> 03:44:40.166
HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER THE LAST

03:44:40.233 --> 03:44:40.767
SIX TWENTY THIRTY YEARS SINCE

REALIGNMENT- OUR CASELOADS HAVE

03:44:44.971 --> 03:44:47.841
. MORE THAN DOUBLED. WE HAVE

03:44:47.907 --> 03:44:50.910
ABOUT 50% OF THE STUFF THAT WE

03:44:50.977 --> 03:44:58.318
NEED TO MEET THE NEED CURRENTLY. AND SO WE SUBMIT RESPECTFULLY

03:44:58.384 --> 03:45:02.889

FOLLOWING OBSTACLES AND

03:45:08.061 --> 03:45:08.595
DIFFICULTIES THAT OUR MEMBERS

03:45:08.661 --> 03:45:12.599
ARE FACING. OUR MEMBERS ARE SO

03:45:12.665 --> 03:45:15.468
SHORT STAFFED. THAT WE CANNOT

03:45:15.535 --> 03:45:17.070

THAT THEY DESERVE IT. AN EVER

03:45:22.075 --> 03:45:23.276
GROWING NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

03:45:23.343 --> 03:45:24.844
WITH SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT

03:45:24.911 --> 03:45:26.846
MENTAL ILLNESS EXISTING EXITING

03:45:26.913 --> 03:45:29.349
THE JAILS. THE PRISONS AND ACUTE

03:45:29.415 --> 03:45:34.354
HOSPITALS. HAS INTENSIFIED AND

03:45:34.420 --> 03:45:35.755
WE ARE GETTING THOSE REFERRALS

03:45:35.822 --> 03:45:39.092
BECAUSE OF THE- DIVERSION FROM

03:45:39.158 --> 03:45:40.627
THE MIDDLE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM

03:45:40.693 --> 03:45:42.295
FROM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

03:45:42.362 --> 03:45:44.063
NOT TOO LITTLE I'M SORRY. FROM

03:45:44.130 --> 03:45:47.066
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. BECAUSE

03:45:47.133 --> 03:45:47.600
INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING TO

03:45:47.667 --> 03:45:50.837
CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT HAS BECOME

03:45:50.904 --> 03:45:55.975
THE NORM THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

03:45:56.042 --> 03:45:57.977
JUSTICE REFORM HAS REALLY

03:45:58.044 --> 03:45:59.712
RESULTED IN AND OUT

03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:01.447
CONSERVATORSHIP AS THE

03:46:01.514 --> 03:46:03.683
ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION.

03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:06.519
AND THAT IS NOT. AND I'M NOT

03:46:06.586 --> 03:46:07.987
SAYING THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE

03:46:08.054 --> 03:46:09.555
WRONG THING THAT'S JUST THE

03:46:09.622 --> 03:46:12.558
REALITY AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO

03:46:12.625 --> 03:46:14.594
DESERVE TREATMENT AND OFTENTIMES

03:46:14.661 --> 03:46:17.063
NEED CONSERVATORSHIP THE PROBLEM

03:46:17.130 --> 03:46:20.166
IS. THERE'S ONLY SO MANY STUFF

03:46:20.233 --> 03:46:23.770
IN A GIVEN OFFICE AND WE SIMPLY

03:46:23.836 --> 03:46:26.005
DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO

03:46:26.072 --> 03:46:27.540
ABSORB THOSE INDIVIDUALS ANY

03:46:27.607 --> 03:46:31.644
LONGER. IN ADDITION THE

03:46:31.711 --> 03:46:33.179
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

03:46:33.246 --> 03:46:34.447
CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR

03:46:34.514 --> 03:46:36.215
STATE IS ALSO IMPACTING OUR

03:46:36.282 --> 03:46:38.885
MEMBERS. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS

03:46:38.952 --> 03:46:40.086
WHO HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH A

03:46:40.153 --> 03:46:42.822
CRIME. AND THEY HAVE BEEN

03:46:42.889 --> 03:46:44.691
DETERMINED TO BE INCOMPETENT TO

03:46:44.757 --> 03:46:46.059
STAND TRIAL THEY DON'T HAVE THE

03:46:46.125 --> 03:46:47.961
CAPACITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR

03:46:48.027 --> 03:46:50.863
OWN DEFENSE SO AS A RESULT.

03:46:50.930 --> 03:46:52.598
THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO FOR

03:46:52.665 --> 03:46:54.300
TREATMENT TO BE RESTORED

03:46:54.367 --> 03:46:55.935
OFTENTIMES THEY'RE NOT RESTORED

03:46:56.002 --> 03:46:57.670
AND SO THEY COME TO

03:46:57.737 --> 03:47:01.574
CONSERVATORSHIP AS A RESULT.

03:47:01.641 --> 03:47:02.675
THREE THERE'S A LOT THAT GOES

03:47:02.742 --> 03:47:04.577
INTO EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY

03:47:04.644 --> 03:47:06.179
WHICH IS GOING TO DOUBLE THAT

03:47:06.245 --> 03:47:07.747
NUMBER THAT WE'RE GETTING NOW.

03:47:07.814 --> 03:47:09.682
BECAUSE OF THE MISDEMEANOR

03:47:09.749 --> 03:47:11.517
INCOMPETENCE STAND TRIAL CASES

03:47:11.584 --> 03:47:13.219
WILL ALL BE COMING OUR WAY NOT

03:47:13.286 --> 03:47:14.988
ALL OF THEM THAT'S NOT ACCURATE.

03:47:15.054 --> 03:47:16.289
BUT WE WILL BE SEEING AN

03:47:16.356 --> 03:47:18.524
INCREASE IN THOSE CASES BECAUSE

03:47:18.591 --> 03:47:20.293
THEY NO LONGER WILL BE GOING FOR

03:47:20.360 --> 03:47:23.262
COMPETENCY TRAINING. THEY WILL

03:47:23.329 --> 03:47:23.696
BE COMING MOSTLY THE

03:47:23.763 --> 03:47:27.033
CONSERVATORSHIP. THE HIGH BURDEN

03:47:27.100 --> 03:47:30.870
OF PROOF. IN THE LPS ACT. AND

03:47:30.937 --> 03:47:33.072
MANY CASE LAW PRECEDENTS HAVE

03:47:33.139 --> 03:47:34.707
NARROWED THE DEFINITION OF GREAT

03:47:34.774 --> 03:47:37.343
DISABILITY. IT HAS ALSO LED TO

03:47:37.410 --> 03:47:39.612
THE UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION THE

03:47:39.679 --> 03:47:41.748
PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATORS ARE

03:47:41.814 --> 03:47:43.583
THE ANSWER TO THE SOCIETAL

03:47:43.649 --> 03:47:44.984
PROBLEMS THAT FORCED WERE

03:47:45.051 --> 03:47:47.020
CHALLENGED WITH AT THE MOMENT.

03:47:47.086 --> 03:47:48.354
MOSTLY THE HOMELESS AND

03:47:48.421 --> 03:47:50.823
UNSHELTERED THERE IS A BELIEF IN

03:47:50.890 --> 03:47:52.258
SOME SOME AREAS THAT

03:47:52.325 --> 03:47:53.726
CONSERVATORSHIP CAN SOLVE THAT

03:47:53.793 --> 03:47:55.661
PROBLEM I'M HERE TO TELL YOU CAN

03:47:55.728 --> 03:47:59.132
NOT. WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY

03:47:59.198 --> 03:48:00.400
NOR DO A LOT OF THOSE

03:48:00.466 --> 03:48:02.368
INDIVIDUALS NEED THAT LEVEL OF

03:48:02.435 --> 03:48:06.005
CARE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE

03:48:06.072 --> 03:48:08.107
CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING. THERE

03:48:08.174 --> 03:48:10.743
IS A LOT OF THERE'S AN INCREASE

03:48:10.810 --> 03:48:12.645
IN LOOKING TO CONSERVATORSHIP TO

03:48:12.712 --> 03:48:15.915
SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. WE ALSO

03:48:15.982 --> 03:48:18.284
DON'T HAVE ANY PARTNERSHIP WITH

03:48:18.351 --> 03:48:20.720
A STATE AGENCY. WITHOUT A STATE

03:48:20.787 --> 03:48:21.954
PARTNERSHIP WE CAN'T MEET THE

03:48:22.021 --> 03:48:23.723
GROWING NEEDS OR COLLECT THE

03:48:23.790 --> 03:48:27.226
DATA. THAT WE NEED TO MEASURE

03:48:27.293 --> 03:48:28.728
THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES THAT

03:48:28.795 --> 03:48:30.930
WE'RE PROVIDING. AND CERTAINLY

03:48:30.997 --> 03:48:32.398
CAN'T DEVELOP THE INFORMATION WE

03:48:32.465 --> 03:48:34.033
NEED TO GUIDE FUTURE POLICY

03:48:34.100 --> 03:48:37.170
DECISION MAKING. OUR PUBLIC

03:48:37.236 --> 03:48:40.406

SO LET ME TELL YOU JUST THROUGH

03:52:00.873 --> 03:52:02.541
MY LENS WHERE I SEE THE FIVE

03:52:02.608 --> 03:52:03.576
OBSTACLES THAT WERE REALLY

03:52:03.643 --> 03:52:05.411
FACING NUMBER ONE LACK OF

03:52:05.478 --> 03:52:07.046
PLACEMENT IN HOUSING WE'VE HEARD

03:52:07.113 --> 03:52:08.814

OR THROUGH THE STATE HOSPITALS

03:52:14.387 --> 03:52:15.121
THOSE ARE USUALLY YOUR THREE

03:52:15.187 --> 03:52:18.658
AVENUES. BOARDING CARE THERE IS

03:52:18.724 --> 03:52:19.292
A LICENSING ISSUE AND I'LL TELL

03:52:19.358 --> 03:52:21.961
YOU WHAT IT IS. ROMAN BOARDS

03:52:22.028 --> 03:52:23.929
DON'T REQUIRE A STATE LICENSE.

03:52:23.996 --> 03:52:25.631
SO GUESS WHAT HAPPENING THOSE

03:52:25.698 --> 03:52:27.733
BOARDING CARES ARE SHUTTING DOWN

03:52:27.800 --> 03:52:29.302
AND BEING CALLED ROMAN BOARDS

03:52:29.368 --> 03:52:31.003
IT'S A WHOLE LOT EASIER THERE'S

03:52:31.070 --> 03:52:33.105
NO OVERSIGHT FROM THE STATE.

03:52:33.172 --> 03:52:34.006
RIGHT AND THEY CAN CHARGE WHAT

03:52:34.073 --> 03:52:35.975
THEY WANT. AND THERE'S NOBODY

03:52:36.042 --> 03:52:37.109
AUDITING OF THERE'S NO ONE

03:52:37.176 --> 03:52:38.511
COMING IN SO WE'RE SEEING AN

03:52:38.577 --> 03:52:39.912
INCREASE IN ALL THESE REMEMBER

03:52:39.979 --> 03:52:41.247
IT'S POPPING UP EVERYWHERE BUT

03:52:41.314 --> 03:52:42.348
WE CAN'T PLACE PEOPLE IN

03:52:42.415 --> 03:52:44.650
CONSERVATIVE AND REMEMBER THAT'S

03:52:44.717 --> 03:52:46.319
NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE. THE

03:52:46.385 --> 03:52:47.920
OTHER THING WE'RE SEEING. IS THE

03:52:47.987 --> 03:52:49.555
STATE SET DOWN OR DEVELOPMENTAL

03:52:49.622 --> 03:52:51.724
DELAYS CENTER. AND WHERE DID

03:52:51.791 --> 03:52:53.926
THOSE INDIVIDUALS GO THEY WENT

03:52:53.993 --> 03:52:55.895
TO BOARDING CARES AND GUESS WHAT

03:52:55.961 --> 03:52:58.464
BOARDING HERE'S GOT MORE MONEY

03:52:58.531 --> 03:52:59.465
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE

03:52:59.532 --> 03:53:01.534
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY ISSUE THEN

03:53:01.600 --> 03:53:03.536
WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. SO

03:53:03.602 --> 03:53:05.137
WHAT YOU HAD IN YOUR BOARDING

03:53:05.204 --> 03:53:07.273
CARDS ACROSS THE STATE BECOME

03:53:07.340 --> 03:53:09.108
DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS BOARDING

03:53:09.175 --> 03:53:10.843
CARES WHERE THOSE PARTY CARES

03:53:10.910 --> 03:53:12.912
MADE MORE MONEY LEAVING THE

03:53:12.978 --> 03:53:15.314
MENTAL HEALTH FORTY CARES

03:53:15.381 --> 03:53:16.482

03:53:35.101 --> 03:53:37.703
POLLS. THOSE FOURTEEN PATIENTS

03:53:37.770 --> 03:53:39.739

HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY THAT'S

03:53:46.345 --> 03:53:48.214
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR

03:53:48.280 --> 03:53:49.749
THOSE FOURTEEN PATIENTS SITTING

03:53:49.815 --> 03:53:52.084
IN A UC DAVIS. HOSPITAL WHEN

03:53:52.151 --> 03:53:53.819
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE

03:53:53.886 --> 03:53:56.122
ELSE- I HAVE PATIENTS I HAVE

03:53:56.188 --> 03:53:57.523
CLIENTS IN JAIL WAITING TWO

03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:59.392

INTO BETTER PLACEMENT. THAT'S

03:54:08.734 --> 03:54:11.203
NOT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE I'M

03:54:11.270 --> 03:54:11.804

COORDINATION WITH STATES WE

03:54:22.915 --> 03:54:25.885
RIGHT NOW HAVE- STATES AND

03:54:25.951 --> 03:54:27.553
COUNTIES NOT HAVING RESOURCES SO

THEY DUMPED INTO OTHER COUNTIES.

03:54:29.555 --> 03:54:30.489
AND THE OTHER BIG ISSUE IS

03:54:30.556 --> 03:54:32.291
FINDING WE HAVE A GREAT STATE

03:54:32.358 --> 03:54:34.860

ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND I

03:58:44.943 --> 03:58:45.978
FIRST REALLY WHEN I THINK

03:58:46.045 --> 03:58:47.279
KERRISON CLUTCH YOU SHARE THEIR

03:58:47.346 --> 03:58:49.248
PERSONAL STORIES EARLIER FOR

03:58:49.314 --> 03:58:50.049
ABOUT THEIR BRAVERY AND THEIR

03:58:50.115 --> 03:58:52.184
GENEROSITY. I KNOW THIS IS A

03:58:52.251 --> 03:58:53.786
DIFFICULT EMOTIONAL TOPIC FOR

03:58:53.852 --> 03:58:54.920
MANY OF US WHO ARE INVOLVED

03:58:54.987 --> 03:58:56.655
BECAUSE OF OUR PERSONAL

03:58:56.722 --> 03:58:57.256
EXPERIENCE I ALSO WENT WITH

03:58:57.322 --> 03:58:59.491
KNOWLEDGE THAT I WAS ASKED TO

03:58:59.558 --> 03:59:00.893
ADDRESS RACIAL DISPARITIES AND

03:59:00.959 --> 03:59:02.594
RACIAL JUSTICE CONSIDERATIONS

03:59:02.661 --> 03:59:04.263
FOR THIS CONVERSATION AND I PLAN

03:59:04.329 --> 03:59:06.031
TO ADDRESS THIS IN THREE AREAS

03:59:06.098 --> 03:59:07.566
WHAT WE KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

03:59:07.633 --> 03:59:10.369
HOW AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE.

03:59:10.436 --> 03:59:11.837
SO FIRST WHAT WE KNOW. WHAT WE

03:59:11.904 --> 03:59:12.938
KNOW IS THAT THERE IS A LONG

03:59:13.005 --> 03:59:14.840
HISTORY. OF BIAS AND

03:59:14.907 --> 03:59:16.475
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE IN

03:59:16.542 --> 03:59:18.577
MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS. AND

03:59:18.644 --> 03:59:20.479
TREATMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

03:59:20.546 --> 03:59:21.847
BUT IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO

03:59:21.914 --> 03:59:23.315
ASSUME THAT THIS IS A THING OF

03:59:23.382 --> 03:59:25.951
THE PAST. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT

03:59:26.018 --> 03:59:27.853
EVEN PRESENTLY BLACK AMERICANS

03:59:27.920 --> 03:59:28.954
ARE OVER DIAGNOSED WITH

03:59:29.021 --> 03:59:30.789
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND UNDER

03:59:30.856 --> 03:59:32.624
DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION. EVEN

03:59:32.691 --> 03:59:33.826
WHEN COMPARING SIMILAR

03:59:33.892 --> 03:59:36.295
SYMPTOMATIC PRESENTATIONS IN

03:59:36.361 --> 03:59:38.330
BLACK AND WHITE PATIENTS. AS A

03:59:38.397 --> 03:59:39.865
RESULT THE AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC

03:59:39.932 --> 03:59:41.834
ASSOCIATION. ISSUED A STATEMENT

03:59:41.900 --> 03:59:44.303
EARLIER THIS YEAR APOLOGIZING.

03:59:44.369 --> 03:59:45.604
TO BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE

03:59:45.671 --> 03:59:46.972
OF COLOR. FOR THE ROLE OF

03:59:47.039 --> 03:59:48.574
PSYCHIATRY IN PERPETUATING

03:59:48.640 --> 03:59:52.144
RACISM IN THE PAST AND TODAY.

03:59:52.211 --> 03:59:53.946
PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN EXPERIENCE

03:59:54.012 --> 03:59:55.447
A TRAJECTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS

03:59:55.514 --> 03:59:56.815
THAT PUTS THEM IN A POSITION OF

03:59:56.882 --> 03:59:58.517
BEING SUBJECT TO ITS COERCIVE

03:59:58.584 --> 03:59:59.918
TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF THEIR

03:59:59.985 --> 04:00:01.787
MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS. THIS

04:00:01.854 --> 04:00:02.855
TAKES THE FORM OF BOTH

04:00:02.921 --> 04:00:04.022
INVOLUNTARY MENTAL HEALTH

04:00:04.089 --> 04:00:06.024
COMMITMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

04:00:06.091 --> 04:00:08.327
INVOLVEMENT. THIS IS BASED ON A

04:00:08.393 --> 04:00:10.662
LACK OF ACCESS TO EVIDENCE BASED

04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:12.598
AFFORDABLE AND COMMUNITY MENTAL

04:00:12.664 --> 04:00:15.400
HEALTH SUPPORTS. AS WELL AS WELL

04:00:15.467 --> 04:00:17.236
AS THE PERVASIVE IMPLICIT BIAS

04:00:17.302 --> 04:00:18.804
THAT LEADS TO THE STIGMATIZING

04:00:18.871 --> 04:00:21.373
BELIEF THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR

04:00:21.440 --> 04:00:22.007
EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS ARE

04:00:22.074 --> 04:00:24.109
DANGEROUS. PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE

04:00:24.176 --> 04:00:25.778
LESS LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

04:00:25.844 --> 04:00:27.446
EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

04:00:27.513 --> 04:00:28.747

THOSE WHO DO MAKE IT THROUGH THE

04:00:34.586 --> 04:00:36.355
DOOR AND WHO DO ACCESS SERVICES.

04:00:36.421 --> 04:00:38.123
PEOPLE OF COLOR OFTEN EXPERIENCE

04:00:38.190 --> 04:00:39.858
LOWER QUALITY OR LESS EFFECTIVE

04:00:39.925 --> 04:00:42.361

TREATMENT. WHICH IS OFTEN A

04:00:47.232 --> 04:00:49.134
GATEWAY TO SHORT AND LONG TERM

04:00:49.201 --> 04:00:51.103
INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENTS. AS A

04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:52.204
RESULT PEOPLE OF COLOR

04:00:52.271 --> 04:00:54.006
DISPROPORTIONATELY REPRESENTED

04:00:54.072 --> 04:00:55.541

INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT- SETTINGS

04:01:03.482 --> 04:01:06.151
PER TWENTY YEAR PERIOD 35% OF

SHOWS THAT BLACK CLIENTS ARE

04:01:18.197 --> 04:01:19.298
NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO

04:01:30.876 --> 04:01:32.177
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND THE GAPS

04:01:32.244 --> 04:01:33.779
IN DATA HAVE BEEN ROBUSTLY

04:01:33.846 --> 04:01:36.081
DISCUSSED TODAY. BUT I WILL ADD

04:01:36.148 --> 04:01:38.116
TO THAT THAT WE DON'T KEEP

04:01:38.183 --> 04:01:40.919

SERVICES. AND AS A RESULT WE'RE

04:01:50.529 --> 04:01:51.763
UNABLE AT THE STATE AND YOU ARE

04:01:51.830 --> 04:01:53.632

04:02:30.002 --> 04:02:31.036
THIRD WE MUST STOP LETTING

MARGINALIZED CALIFORNIANS FALL

04:02:32.604 --> 04:02:33.705

STUCK OUT ON THE STREETS A GREAT

04:15:20.605 --> 04:15:22.140
HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

04:15:22.206 --> 04:15:23.341
THOSE ARE FOLKS WHO ALREADY

04:15:23.408 --> 04:15:25.243
QUALIFY FOR CONSERVATORSHIP THE

04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:26.144
NUMBER OF PEOPLE CONSERVING

04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:28.513
CALIFORNIA YES IS FALLEN- BUT

04:15:28.579 --> 04:15:29.147
IT'S NOT THAT THE

04:15:29.213 --> 04:15:30.815
CONSERVATORSHIP STANDARD IS TOO

04:15:30.882 --> 04:15:31.949
STRICT FOR THE JUDGES ARE

04:15:32.016 --> 04:15:33.651
APPLYING THE STANDARD TO NEARLY.

04:15:33.718 --> 04:15:35.019
RATHER CONSERVATORSHIP FACES THE

04:15:35.086 --> 04:15:36.554
SAME PROBLEM AS EVERYTHING ELSE

04:15:36.621 --> 04:15:38.122
IN OUR SYSTEM INSUFFICIENT FUNDS

04:15:38.189 --> 04:15:40.058
AND CAPACITY. IF THEY DON'T GET

04:15:40.124 --> 04:15:41.259
CONCERNED IT'S A FAILURE OF THE

04:15:41.325 --> 04:15:43.361
SYSTEM OF CARE. THIS ISSUE HAS

04:15:43.428 --> 04:15:44.429
BEEN ROUTED INTO A VERY FALSE

04:15:44.495 --> 04:15:45.630
CHOICE THE CHOICE BETWEEN

04:15:45.697 --> 04:15:46.497
KEEPING PEOPLE ON THE STREETS

04:15:46.564 --> 04:15:48.533
THE COMPENSATOR DIE. OR

04:15:48.599 --> 04:15:50.435
EXPERIENCE YES TO MAKE IT EASIER

04:15:50.501 --> 04:15:51.135
TO FOR STREET BUT THERE'S A

04:15:51.202 --> 04:15:53.371
WHOLE OCEAN. OF AFFECTED POLICY

04:15:53.438 --> 04:15:55.206
AND SYSTEM CHOICES BETWEEN THOSE

04:15:55.273 --> 04:15:57.608
TWO. IT SOME WE DON'T GIVE

04:15:57.675 --> 04:15:59.844
PEOPLE THE CARE THEY NEED. WAIT

04:15:59.911 --> 04:16:00.812
UNTIL THEY'RE IN CRISIS TO GET

04:16:00.878 --> 04:16:02.914
CARE ALL THEM AND SPENT ABOUT

04:16:02.980 --> 04:16:05.016
LIKELY MOST LIKELY WORSE OFF

04:16:05.083 --> 04:16:07.251
THAN BEFORE. MOST PEOPLE'S FIRST

04:16:07.318 --> 04:16:08.453
INTERACTION WITH THE MENTAL

04:16:08.519 --> 04:16:09.687
HEALTH SYSTEM IS IN HANDCUFFS IN

04:16:09.754 --> 04:16:11.489
THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR. IF YOU

04:16:11.556 --> 04:16:12.390
LOOK AT THE EXPANSIONS OF

04:16:12.457 --> 04:16:13.725
CONSERVATORSHIP THE EVIDENCE

04:16:13.791 --> 04:16:14.726
THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE WAS

04:16:14.792 --> 04:16:15.893
NOT THE FORCING OF TREATMENT BUT

04:16:15.960 --> 04:16:18.096
THE AVAILABILITY. OF TREATMENT

04:16:18.162 --> 04:16:18.663
THAT MEETS THE INDIVIDUAL'S

04:16:18.730 --> 04:16:22.900
NEEDS. THAT WAS NEVER AVAILABLE

04:16:22.967 --> 04:16:23.534
BEFORE. FOR ME THIS IS NOT AN-

04:16:23.601 --> 04:16:24.969
AND- IT'S A QUESTION OF WHAT IS

04:16:25.036 --> 04:16:27.038
THEMOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION.

04:16:27.105 --> 04:16:28.239
WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS THAT

04:16:28.306 --> 04:16:30.041
WORK. ON HOUSE PEOPLE WITH

04:16:30.108 --> 04:16:31.008
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES CAN

04:16:31.075 --> 04:16:32.543
TELL YOU WHAT THEY ARE. THEY

04:16:32.610 --> 04:16:33.578
WILL TELL YOU FROM THEIR

04:16:33.644 --> 04:16:34.979
PERSPECTIVE THAT OCCASIONALLY

04:16:35.046 --> 04:16:37.081
THEY NEED TO BE LOCKED UP. BUT

04:16:37.148 --> 04:16:39.183
MORE OFTEN AND WHAT IS THE VERY

04:16:39.250 --> 04:16:41.352
COMMON THING. IS THAT THEY NEED

04:16:41.419 --> 04:16:43.554
TO STOP BEING LOCKED OUT. I AM

04:16:43.621 --> 04:16:45.823
GOING TO END UP. AND THIS WITH

04:16:45.890 --> 04:16:47.391
THE CLOSING OF A QUESTION. WHY

04:16:47.458 --> 04:16:48.893
IS THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOCUS

04:16:48.960 --> 04:16:49.627
ON EXPANDING THE MOST

04:16:49.694 --> 04:16:51.262
DISCRIMINATORY LEAST AFFECTED

04:16:51.329 --> 04:16:52.797
MOST RESTRICTIVE AND MOST COSTLY

04:16:52.864 --> 04:16:54.732
ELEMENT OF THE SYSTEM. IS THE

04:16:54.799 --> 04:16:56.334
STATE LEGISLATURE INTERESTED IN

04:16:56.400 --> 04:16:59.170
SOLVING THE ISSUE. AND IF SO.

04:16:59.237 --> 04:17:00.938
YOU SERIOUSLY MISDIAGNOSED THE

04:17:01.005 --> 04:17:04.442

PEOPLE'S MIND IF PEOPLE LIVING

A STATE WHERE THE COST OF

04:17:50.788 --> 04:17:52.623
COINCIDENCE THAT LOS ANGELES AN

04:17:52.690 --> 04:17:53.991

THE ANSWER TO THIS CRISIS IS NOT

04:18:08.406 --> 04:18:09.507
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO CONSERVE

04:18:09.574 --> 04:18:11.342
PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS TO ADDRESS

04:18:11.409 --> 04:18:12.810
THE COST OF HOUSING AND PROVIDE

04:18:12.877 --> 04:18:14.378

TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS

04:18:17.381 --> 04:18:18.816
MEANS THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

04:18:18.883 --> 04:18:20.218
WILL UNDERGO THE TRAUMA OF

04:18:20.284 --> 04:18:22.119
HAVING NO HOMES AND MORE AND

04:21:40.684 --> 04:21:43.054
RELAPSE. THE LPS ACT WAS BUILT

04:21:43.120 --> 04:21:44.522
ON A PROMISE THAT A

04:21:54.999 --> 04:21:56.634
OUR CONCERNS ABOUT EXPANDING THE

04:21:56.700 --> 04:21:58.169
USE OF CONSERVATORSHIP IS NOT

04:21:58.235 --> 04:21:59.070
WITH THE PHILOSOPHICAL

04:21:59.136 --> 04:22:00.671
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE AUTONOMY

04:22:00.738 --> 04:22:02.406
OF THE INDIVIDUAL BUT IT'S ALSO

04:22:02.473 --> 04:22:03.841
BASED IN THE REAL HARM THAT

04:22:03.908 --> 04:22:05.276
TAKING AWAY AN INDIVIDUAL'S

04:22:05.342 --> 04:22:07.144
RIGHTS AND RIGHTS AND FOURTEEN

04:22:07.211 --> 04:22:08.646
TREATMENT ON AND THAT.

04:22:08.712 --> 04:22:10.347
PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:22:10.414 --> 04:22:12.516
ON HOW THEY'RE ALREADY SUBJECT

04:22:12.583 --> 04:22:14.218
TO INCREASE DISCRIMINATION

04:22:14.285 --> 04:22:16.120
HARASSMENT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

04:22:16.187 --> 04:22:17.922
TARGETING OF UNFAIR LAWS

04:22:17.988 --> 04:22:18.889
INCREASING COUNTERS WITH THE

04:22:18.956 --> 04:22:20.858
POLICE CRIMINALIZATION OF BASIC

04:22:20.925 --> 04:22:22.293

POUND IT LEAVING THEM LESS STATE

04:22:31.569 --> 04:22:33.471
AND FURTHER FROM STABILITY.

04:22:33.537 --> 04:22:34.905
HOMELESSNESS ITSELF IS AN

04:22:34.972 --> 04:22:37.174
ONGOING TRAUMA LIVING WITH SUCH

04:22:37.241 --> 04:22:38.442
STRESSORS WOULD CHALLENGE THE

04:22:40.144 --> 04:22:41.846
IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR INDIVIDUALS

04:22:41.912 --> 04:22:43.414
TO HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS

04:22:43.481 --> 04:22:47.084

TRAUMAS. HAVING SOMEONE OF THE

04:22:48.519 --> 04:22:49.954
RIGHT AND FOURTEEN TREAT IS YET

04:22:50.020 --> 04:22:51.255
ANOTHER TRAUMA THAT CAN MAKE

04:22:51.322 --> 04:22:53.157
STABILIZATION EVEN HARDER TO

04:22:53.224 --> 04:22:54.592
CHANGE DUE TO THE PERSON

04:22:54.658 --> 04:22:56.427
INCREASING DISTRUST OF THE

04:28:03.233 --> 04:28:04.334
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR HUMAN

04:28:04.401 --> 04:28:06.670

OUT OF ALL THOSE ENTITIES. ONLY

04:28:13.377 --> 04:28:15.245
PUBLIC GUARDIANS ARE THE ONLY

04:28:15.312 --> 04:28:16.447
ONES WHO RECEIVE NO STATE

04:28:16.513 --> 04:28:17.815

04:28:27.658 --> 04:28:28.692
GUARDIANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH

04:28:28.759 --> 04:28:30.661
THE LARGE CASELOADS COMPLEX

04:28:30.727 --> 04:28:33.063
REQUIREMENTS. ARE THEY ALSO

04:28:33.130 --> 04:28:34.465
STRUGGLE WITH WHAT ANOTHER ISSUE

04:28:34.531 --> 04:28:35.632
THAT'S BEEN RAISED HERE TO

04:28:35.699 --> 04:28:37.768
ISSUES ACTUALLY EQUITY AND A

04:28:37.835 --> 04:28:40.270
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. ONLY NOT

04:28:40.337 --> 04:28:42.039
ONLY INTO THEIR OWN SYSTEM BUT

04:28:42.105 --> 04:28:43.974
THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE STATEWIDE

04:28:44.041 --> 04:28:46.376
. BECAUSE OF THIS. COUNTIES ARE

04:28:46.443 --> 04:28:48.946
EAGER FOR HELP I WOULD LIKE TO

04:28:49.012 --> 04:28:49.780
INSURE STEP DOWN CARE

04:28:49.847 --> 04:28:51.615
COORDINATION AND TRACK OUTCOMES

04:28:51.682 --> 04:28:53.350
FOR CLIENTS WOULD LIKE TOGETHER

04:28:53.417 --> 04:28:55.152
SHARE DATA I WOULD LIKE TO

04:28:55.219 --> 04:28:57.020
COLLABORATE MORE TO BETTER SERVE

04:28:57.087 --> 04:29:00.090
CONSERVANCIES BUT THE LINCHPINS

04:29:00.157 --> 04:29:01.992
OF THE SYSTEM THE PUBLIC

04:29:02.059 --> 04:29:02.593
GUARDIANS. ARE AT THE BREAKING

04:29:02.659 --> 04:29:05.496
POINT. THUS THE SINGLE LARGEST

04:29:05.562 --> 04:29:06.864
CHALLENGER MARC PERSPECTIVE IS

04:29:06.930 --> 04:29:08.899
THE NEED FOR NEW STATE RESOURCES

04:29:08.966 --> 04:29:10.934
TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE TOGETHER.

04:29:11.001 --> 04:29:12.269
IT'S SIMILAR TO THE HOMELESSNESS

04:29:12.336 --> 04:29:14.104
ISSUE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS

04:29:14.171 --> 04:29:15.439
BEFORE THAT IT WAS CONSIDERED A

04:29:15.506 --> 04:29:17.207
LOCAL PROBLEM. CITIES AND

04:29:17.274 --> 04:29:19.409
COUNTIES GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER

04:29:19.476 --> 04:29:21.879
AND SOLVE HOMELESSNESS. AFTER

04:29:21.945 --> 04:29:24.014
MANY YEARS OF ADVOCACY AND LOTS

04:29:24.081 --> 04:29:26.517
AND LOTS OF DISCUSSION- THE-

04:29:26.583 --> 04:29:27.751
BROWN ADMINISTRATION IN THE

04:29:27.818 --> 04:29:29.520
NOOSA MINISTRATION IN A HUGE

04:29:29.586 --> 04:29:31.488
WAY. HAVE STEPPED FORWARD TO

04:29:31.555 --> 04:29:36.226
HELP LOCALITIES WITH THIS ISSUE-

04:29:36.293 --> 04:29:37.394
AND WHAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW

04:29:37.461 --> 04:29:39.329
. MANY ARE NOT SEEING THE

04:29:39.396 --> 04:29:40.597
PROGRESS THAT'S BEEN MADE BUT

04:29:40.664 --> 04:29:43.901
IT'S BEING MADE- IT'S BECAUSE

04:29:43.967 --> 04:29:45.869
THE STATE AND LOCALITIES ARE NOW

04:29:45.936 --> 04:29:47.671
ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION.

04:29:47.738 --> 04:29:49.806
THAT'S REALLY IS WHAT IT IS AND

04:29:49.873 --> 04:29:51.375
SO I WANNA MAKE THAT ANALOGY FOR

04:29:51.441 --> 04:29:53.577
THE PUBLIC GUARDIANS IF WE CAN

04:29:53.644 --> 04:29:57.247
PARTNER- WE CAN- HAVE RESOURCES

04:29:57.314 --> 04:29:59.116
THAT WORK FOR US WE CAN INCREASE

04:29:59.182 --> 04:30:00.918
THE DATA PER TRANSPARENCY WE CAN

04:30:00.984 --> 04:30:02.586
INCREASE THE LEVEL OF SERVICE.

04:30:02.653 --> 04:30:04.121
AND WE CAN BETTER TAKE CARE OF

04:30:04.187 --> 04:30:07.824
ALL CONSERVATIVES- I'M SURE THIS

04:30:07.891 --> 04:30:09.226
TEAM DOCTOR SHERIN WHO SPEAKS

04:30:09.293 --> 04:30:10.227
AFTER ME HAS A FEW MORE

04:30:10.294 --> 04:30:12.896
IMPORTANT WANTS TO ELIMINATE-

04:30:12.963 --> 04:30:15.399
BUT ALL OF THE- GAPS IN HURDLES

04:30:15.465 --> 04:30:17.167
WE'VE HEARD TODAY. I THINK

04:30:17.234 --> 04:30:18.936
RESOURCES IS ONE OF THE MAJOR

04:30:19.002 --> 04:30:21.238
ONES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

04:30:21.305 --> 04:30:22.706
PARTNERING WITH THE STATE TO

04:30:22.773 --> 04:30:25.375
WORK ON THIS FURTHER. THANK YOU

04:30:28.178 --> 04:30:31.648

OFTEN- IN THE STREETS IN SKID

04:30:46.763 --> 04:30:50.534
ROW IN HOLLYWOOD- TED HELP THE

POPULATION THAT WERE-

04:30:52.636 --> 04:30:57.541
DISTRACTING ABOUT RIGHT NOW- AND

04:30:57.608 --> 04:30:58.175
I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE FIRST OFF

04:30:58.241 --> 04:31:01.678
THAT. THE POINTS ARE BEING MADE

04:31:01.745 --> 04:31:02.846
BY EVERYBODY ARE YOU ARE

04:31:02.913 --> 04:31:05.449
ENTIRELY VALID AND A LOT OF THIS

04:31:05.515 --> 04:31:07.818
DOES TRACE BACK TO. THE D.

04:31:07.884 --> 04:31:09.353
INSTITUTIONALIZATION MOVEMENT

04:31:09.419 --> 04:31:11.488
WHICH JFK TRIED TO LAUNCH AND IN

04:31:11.555 --> 04:31:13.790
SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD IS DONE

04:31:13.857 --> 04:31:14.391
PROPERLY ONE OF THEM WHICH IS

04:31:14.458 --> 04:31:16.093
PROBABLY BEST KNOWN AS- IN

04:31:16.159 --> 04:31:16.660
TRIESTE ITALY BUT IT DIDN'T

04:31:16.727 --> 04:31:19.796
HAPPEN. WELL IN THE UNITED

04:31:19.863 --> 04:31:21.431
STATES AND CERTAINLY NOT. IN

04:31:21.498 --> 04:31:22.666
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

04:31:22.733 --> 04:31:25.035
BUILD UP OUR COMMUNITY RESOURCES

04:31:25.102 --> 04:31:26.103
MIGHT BE TREATMENT OPPORTUNITIES

04:31:26.169 --> 04:31:27.404
BUT I MEAN ALSO SHOT SOCIAL

04:31:27.471 --> 04:31:30.140
DETERMINANTS. AND OUR GOAL IS TO

04:31:30.207 --> 04:31:33.210
CREATE MORE OF A SYSTEM WHERE

04:31:33.276 --> 04:31:35.145
PEOPLE CAN GET THE SERVICES THEY

04:31:35.212 --> 04:31:36.913
NEED. WHEN THEY NEED THEM WHERE

04:31:36.980 --> 04:31:37.981
THEY NEED AND HOW THEY YOU KNOW

04:31:38.048 --> 04:31:39.583
FROM WHOM THEY NEED THAT WHICH

04:31:39.650 --> 04:31:41.084
OCCURS MYRICK PRODUCT I BELIEVE

04:31:41.151 --> 04:31:43.186
IN A REALLY LOVELY WAY. AND THAT

04:31:43.253 --> 04:31:45.856
THOSE SERVICES NEED TO BE

04:31:45.922 --> 04:31:46.923
DIGNIFIED AND WELCOMING. I WITH

04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:48.091
THAT BEING THE CASE IN L. A.

04:31:48.158 --> 04:31:49.393
COUNTY AND I'M SPEAKING ON

04:31:49.459 --> 04:31:50.560
BEHALF OF L. A. COUNTY NOT ALL

COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. I'M

04:31:52.596 --> 04:31:53.730

04:31:53.797 --> 04:31:56.400
JOB OF REPRESENTING CVH YET. WE

04:31:56.466 --> 04:31:57.267
CLEARLY HAVE A HUMANITARIAN

04:31:57.334 --> 04:31:58.802
CRISIS AND I'M NOT SAYING WE'VE

04:31:58.869 --> 04:32:04.908
GOT TO WITH THE ONLY ONES. AND.

04:32:04.975 --> 04:32:07.310
IS HEALTH ISSUES AND AGAIN THE

04:32:07.377 --> 04:32:10.981
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. CONSPIRE IN

04:32:11.048 --> 04:32:13.784
MANY CASES FOR PEOPLE TO NOT BE

04:32:13.850 --> 04:32:14.351
ABLE TO LIVE SAFELY IN THE

04:32:14.418 --> 04:32:16.820
COMMUNITY. ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE

04:32:16.887 --> 04:32:18.088
IS THAT THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

04:32:18.155 --> 04:32:20.190
TRYING TO STUDY THAT NUMBER IT'S

04:32:20.257 --> 04:32:22.059
NOT A BIG NUMBER BUT IT'S A

04:32:22.125 --> 04:32:24.194
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. AND YOU KNOW

04:32:24.261 --> 04:32:25.862
WHAT WHAT WE TALK ABOUT YOUR L.

04:32:25.929 --> 04:32:27.431
A. COUNTY IS THAT. THERE ARE

04:32:27.497 --> 04:32:28.665
MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE GRAVELY

04:32:28.732 --> 04:32:30.033
DISABLED OR GRAVELY DISABLED

04:32:30.100 --> 04:32:31.501
CHASING HER ACTUALLY NOT.

04:32:31.568 --> 04:32:34.571
GETTING CARE AND THE PROBLEM IN

04:32:34.638 --> 04:32:35.205
TERMS OF THE STANDARD OF GREAT

04:32:35.272 --> 04:32:37.240
DISABILITY. ISN'T NECESSARILY

04:32:37.307 --> 04:32:39.042
ABOUT THIS ABOUT THE SCOPE IT'S

04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:42.179
ABOUT ITS- IMPLEMENTATION. OF

04:32:42.245 --> 04:32:43.280
FOOD CLOTHING AND SHELTER

04:32:43.346 --> 04:32:46.216
INTERPRETED BY FRONTLINE WORKERS

04:32:46.283 --> 04:32:46.917
BY COURTS- BY PEOPLE

04:32:46.983 --> 04:32:49.486
DIFFERENTLY- AND THERE ARE

04:32:49.553 --> 04:32:50.787
CHALLENGES AND MANY OF THEM ARE

04:32:50.854 --> 04:32:54.257
BROUGHT UP BY THE AUDIT. AND

04:32:54.324 --> 04:32:57.527
FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AS A PART OF-

04:32:57.594 --> 04:33:01.798
LPS LAW IS USED- IN A WAY THAT-

04:33:01.865 --> 04:33:05.102
CONSENSUALLY TAXES ARE A CUTE.

04:33:05.168 --> 04:33:06.470
RESOURCES IN PARTICULAR ARE OUR

04:33:06.536 --> 04:33:08.105
HOSPITALS AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING

04:33:08.171 --> 04:33:10.207
ABOUT RIGHT NOW IS NOT KEEP

04:33:10.273 --> 04:33:12.576
SITUATION SO I'LL TALK ABOUT IT

04:33:12.642 --> 04:33:15.045
LATER I HOPE THIS AFTERNOON BUT

04:33:15.112 --> 04:33:17.481
NOT ACUTE- SITUATIONS DO NOT

04:33:17.547 --> 04:33:19.549
REQUIRE A CUTE RESOURCES THEY

04:33:19.616 --> 04:33:22.185
REQUIRE I RESOURCES THAT ADDRESS

04:33:22.252 --> 04:33:25.355
A CHRONIC. CONDITION WE NEED TO

04:33:25.422 --> 04:33:26.923
DEVELOP A STANDARD THAT IS

04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:28.725
UNIFORMITY ACCOUNTABLE WHERE WE

04:33:28.792 --> 04:33:30.694
HAD INDICATORS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

04:33:30.761 --> 04:33:32.929
MUCH CLEARER THAN FOOD CLOTHING

04:33:32.996 --> 04:33:36.266
AND SHELTER IN MY OPINION- IN

04:33:36.333 --> 04:33:37.667
TERMS OF- CHAIRMAN WHAT'S

04:33:37.734 --> 04:33:39.169
COMMENT ABOUT IT'S ABOUT

04:33:39.236 --> 04:33:41.271
SERVICES. AND WE ALL AGREE IT'S

04:33:41.338 --> 04:33:42.372
ABOUT SERVICES IT'S ABOUT

04:33:42.439 --> 04:33:43.406
OPPORTUNITIES IT'S ABOUT

04:33:43.473 --> 04:33:46.009
RESOURCES BUT THE ISSUE AND

04:33:46.076 --> 04:33:50.247
WHETHER IT'S A O. T. R. LPS. WE

04:33:50.313 --> 04:33:52.749
HAVE A GREAT DIFFICULTY ENGAGING

04:33:52.816 --> 04:33:55.018
CERTAIN PEOPLE. AND IN FACT THE

04:33:55.085 --> 04:33:56.920
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELD IS

04:33:56.987 --> 04:33:59.790
DEEPLY CHALLENGED BY ENGAGEMENT

04:33:59.856 --> 04:34:01.525
GETTING PEOPLE TO ACCEPT CARE A

04:34:01.591 --> 04:34:03.293
LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

04:34:03.360 --> 04:34:04.861
TYPE OF CARE AND THE CARE THAT'S

04:34:04.928 --> 04:34:06.897
AVAILABLE AND IS DEEPLY BROKEN

04:34:06.963 --> 04:34:08.131
SYSTEM AND I APPRECIATE.

04:34:08.198 --> 04:34:11.234
COLLETTI'S COMMENTS ABOUT SB

04:34:11.301 --> 04:34:11.802
EIGHT OH THREE WHICH DIDN'T

04:34:11.868 --> 04:34:13.203
QUITE GO AS FAR AS WE WANTED BUT

04:34:13.270 --> 04:34:16.406
IS KEY TO THE WHOLE ENGAGEMENT

04:34:16.473 --> 04:34:19.643
CHALLENGE. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS

04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:20.844
THAT WILL ALSO RECOGNIZE ABOUT

04:34:20.911 --> 04:34:22.479
THE STATE IS CALLIN CALLIN IS

04:34:22.546 --> 04:34:24.381
ACTUALLY INCORPORATING

04:34:24.447 --> 04:34:25.715
ENGAGEMENT AND THE ENGAGEMENT

04:34:25.782 --> 04:34:27.984
CAPACITY AS A PART OF WHAT'S

04:34:28.051 --> 04:34:29.653
NEEDED. IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:34:29.719 --> 04:34:31.721
FIELD AND IS ROCKY KELLY SAID AN

04:34:31.788 --> 04:34:33.390
AVERAGE OF FORTY VISITS TO

04:34:33.456 --> 04:34:35.192
ENGAGE SOMEBODY. THAT TYPE OF

04:34:35.258 --> 04:34:36.326
WORK HASN'T REALLY BEEN FUNDED

04:34:36.393 --> 04:34:37.594
PROPERLY AND IT NEEDS TO BE I

04:34:37.661 --> 04:34:39.496
THINK KILLINGS MOVING US IN THAT

04:34:39.563 --> 04:34:40.964
DIRECTION AND ON THE TOPIC OF

04:34:41.031 --> 04:34:42.933
THE GAUGE MEANT. I WOULD ARGUE

04:34:42.999 --> 04:34:45.101
THAT WE NEED A CONTINUUM OF

04:34:45.168 --> 04:34:47.037
TOOLS WITH A CONSERVATORSHIP

04:34:47.103 --> 04:34:49.539
TYPE. ENGAGEMENT TOOL AS THE

04:34:49.606 --> 04:34:51.441
VERY LAST RESORT BUT IF WE CAN

04:34:51.508 --> 04:34:52.642
HAVE A CONTINUE UNDER DEVELOPED

04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:53.910
THE TOOLS OF ENGAGEMENT WHEN

04:34:53.977 --> 04:34:55.812
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO ENGAGE

04:34:55.879 --> 04:34:58.381
DESPITE RELENTLESS EFFORTS WITH

04:34:58.448 --> 04:35:00.217
GUARANTEED RESOURCES. THAT I

04:35:00.283 --> 04:35:02.052
THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL SHARE

04:35:02.118 --> 04:35:03.753
DECISION MAKING PSYCHIATRIC

04:35:03.820 --> 04:35:06.156
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES S. T.

04:35:06.223 --> 04:35:07.457
TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP CAN

04:35:07.524 --> 04:35:11.628
SCAN SERVER TO SHIP THOSE TO BE

04:35:11.695 --> 04:35:12.429
EXAMPLES OF THE CONTINUUM. I'M

04:35:12.495 --> 04:35:14.397
ENGAGEMENT TOOLS. IN TERMS OF

04:35:14.464 --> 04:35:16.366
FINDING WE NEED FUNDING THAT IS

04:35:16.433 --> 04:35:18.435
DEDICATED AND COMMITTED TO THOSE

04:35:18.501 --> 04:35:20.337
WHO IN L. A. RIVER KERR NOT

04:35:20.403 --> 04:35:22.505
LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY

04:35:22.572 --> 04:35:23.540
AND THOSE RESOURCES ARE

04:35:23.607 --> 04:35:25.675
GUARANTEED UP FRONT WHEN WE DO

04:35:25.742 --> 04:35:28.411
RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE

04:35:28.478 --> 04:35:30.447
WHO FIT THAT DESCRIPTION.

04:35:30.513 --> 04:35:31.381
CURRENTLY THE FUNDING IS

04:35:31.448 --> 04:35:33.283
INADEQUATE IN TERMS OF IT BEING

04:35:33.350 --> 04:35:34.684
I'M GOING AND WE APPRECIATE THE

04:35:34.751 --> 04:35:36.353
STATE'S EFFORT TO EXPAND ALL

04:35:36.419 --> 04:35:37.821
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE NEED ON

04:35:37.888 --> 04:35:39.723
GOING FUNDING. ITS SUPER

04:35:39.789 --> 04:35:41.691
COMPLICATED TO ADMINISTER IT'S

04:35:41.758 --> 04:35:44.127
NOT AN ENTITLEMENT. IF WE DECIDE

04:35:44.194 --> 04:35:46.029
THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY THIS

04:35:46.096 --> 04:35:47.597
POPULATION WE HAVE TO REALIZE

04:35:47.664 --> 04:35:48.899
THAT THAT WILL DE PRIORITIZE

04:35:48.965 --> 04:35:50.700
OTHER POPULATIONS IN A ZERO SUM

04:35:50.767 --> 04:35:54.237
GAME. WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE

04:35:54.304 --> 04:35:54.771
THAT AS A PART OF IT BEING

04:35:54.838 --> 04:35:56.339
COMPLICATED. WE NEED MORE

04:35:56.406 --> 04:35:58.174
FLEXIBILITY AND I WOULD POINT TO

04:35:58.241 --> 04:36:01.177
AN HSA IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE.

04:36:01.244 --> 04:36:03.213
IMAGES A FUNDING IT'S FENCED.

04:36:03.280 --> 04:36:05.382
THERE ARE A LOTS OF PROCESS

04:36:05.448 --> 04:36:07.150
REQUIREMENTS. WE NEED

04:36:07.217 --> 04:36:09.252
FLEXIBILITY TO USE IT TO GO

04:36:09.319 --> 04:36:12.155
AFTER. THE PRIORITIES OF THE

04:36:12.222 --> 04:36:13.456
STATE AND WE NEED TO BE HELD

04:36:13.523 --> 04:36:17.027
ACCOUNTABLE TO OUTCOMES NOT TO

04:36:17.093 --> 04:36:19.195
REPORTS AND YOUR PROCESSES. IN

04:36:19.262 --> 04:36:21.998
TERMS OF- ENGAGEMENT WE NEVER

04:36:22.065 --> 04:36:23.800
EVER OUGHT TO BE USING ANY TYPE

04:36:23.867 --> 04:36:26.836
OF ENGAGEMENT TOOL. WITHOUT UP

04:36:26.903 --> 04:36:29.773
FRONT GUARANTEED RESOURCES

04:36:29.839 --> 04:36:30.373
STARTING WITH SHARED DECISION

04:36:30.440 --> 04:36:34.611
MAKING. SO IN SUMMARY. I BELIEVE

04:36:34.678 --> 04:36:35.845
THE STANDARDS NEED TO BE

04:36:35.912 --> 04:36:37.814
REVISITED TO BECOME CLEARER AND

04:36:37.881 --> 04:36:39.582
EASIER I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM I

04:36:39.649 --> 04:36:41.484
ALSO THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY

04:36:41.551 --> 04:36:43.720
WE DO NOT HAVE A CONTINUUM OF

04:36:43.787 --> 04:36:45.622
ENGAGEMENT TOOLS. THAT'S A

04:36:45.689 --> 04:36:48.458
PROBLEM IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY

04:36:48.525 --> 04:36:49.326
AND WE NEED FUNDING THAT IS

04:36:49.392 --> 04:36:51.394
DEDICATED GUARANTEED I WOULD SAY

04:36:51.461 --> 04:36:52.862
THROUGH ENTITLEMENT. AND WE NEED

04:36:52.929 --> 04:36:55.865
TO LOOK AT THIRTY SB EIGHT FIFTY

04:36:55.932 --> 04:36:58.468
FIVE AND HOW WE HOLD OTHER

04:36:58.535 --> 04:37:01.137
PLANS. ACCOUNTABLE AGAIN IT'S A

04:37:01.204 --> 04:37:03.106
PROBLEM AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY

04:37:03.173 --> 04:37:05.275
THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS YES

04:37:05.342 --> 04:37:07.877
WE DO NEED BETTER OVERSIGHT. BUT

04:37:07.944 --> 04:37:10.080
THAT OVERSIGHT NEEDS TO BE OF

04:37:10.146 --> 04:37:12.782
OUTCOMES. AND WE NEED TO BE A

04:37:12.849 --> 04:37:14.918
POWER TO ACHIEVE THEM. WITH

04:37:14.985 --> 04:37:16.519

CLARIFY IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

04:38:12.575 --> 04:38:13.276
ABOUT SOMETHING WE WALK THROUGH

04:38:13.343 --> 04:38:15.545
ALL THE TIME- WHEN I MEAN IT'S

04:38:15.612 --> 04:38:16.880
NOT STATE FUNDED THE CLIENTS

04:38:16.946 --> 04:38:18.882
THAT WE SERVE. DO ACCESS STATE

04:38:18.948 --> 04:38:20.817
FUNDED SERVICES RIGHT IT'S THE

04:38:20.884 --> 04:38:22.018
PUBLIC GUARDIANS AND THEIR

04:38:22.085 --> 04:38:24.687
WORKLOAD AND CASELOAD. WHICH IS-

04:38:24.754 --> 04:38:26.389
DOESN'T RECEIVE ANY STATE OR

04:38:26.456 --> 04:38:28.124
OTHER FEDERAL FUNDING. SO THEY

04:38:28.191 --> 04:38:31.227
ARE COUNTY WORKERS- AND THEY

04:38:31.294 --> 04:38:32.762
THEY THEY HAVE NO CONTROL OVER

04:38:32.829 --> 04:38:34.864
THE CASE LAW THAT THEY RECEIVE-

04:38:34.931 --> 04:38:36.933
BECAUSE IT'S- ONE THING YOU HAVE

04:38:37.000 --> 04:38:38.101
TO RESPOND IN INVESTIGATE EVERY

04:38:38.168 --> 04:38:39.936
REFERRAL. AND THEN OF COURSE THE

04:38:40.003 --> 04:38:42.772
JUDGE DECIDES WHETHER TO- HAVE

04:38:42.839 --> 04:38:43.440
SOMEONE PUT INTO

04:38:43.506 --> 04:38:45.608
CONSERVATORSHIP. AND SO WHAT

04:38:45.675 --> 04:38:46.910
WAIT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NO

04:38:46.976 --> 04:38:48.144
STATE FUNDING. WE'RE TALKING

04:38:48.211 --> 04:38:49.512
ABOUT THE ACTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE

04:38:49.579 --> 04:38:52.115
DUTIES THAT THOSE FOLKS DO- THEY

04:38:52.182 --> 04:38:54.684
DO RECEIVE SOME TARGETED CASE

04:38:54.751 --> 04:38:56.286
MANAGEMENT FUNDING THROUGH MEDIC

04:38:56.352 --> 04:38:58.288
CAL. BUT IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF

04:38:58.354 --> 04:39:00.423
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO- COUNT

04:39:00.490 --> 04:39:01.624
TOWARDS RECEIVING FEDERAL

04:39:01.691 --> 04:39:04.427
REIMBURSEMENT- AND SO THAT'S-

04:39:04.494 --> 04:39:06.930
REALLY. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

04:39:06.996 --> 04:39:08.064
WHEN IT'S SAYING OF THE PUBLIC

04:39:08.131 --> 04:39:09.165
GUARDIANS AND CONSERVATIVE

04:39:09.232 --> 04:39:11.601
PROGRAMS. WERE NOT A REAL LINE

04:39:11.668 --> 04:39:13.369
TO PROGRAM SO THEY DON'T HAVE

04:39:13.436 --> 04:39:15.105
ACCESS THOSE WORKERS. TO THE

04:39:15.171 --> 04:39:17.040
REALIGNMENT FUNDING. DEPENDING

04:39:17.107 --> 04:39:19.008
ON WHERE THEY ARE MANY COUNTIES

04:39:19.075 --> 04:39:21.845
AUGMENT SIGNIFICANTLY- FIND

04:39:21.911 --> 04:39:23.046
EFFICIENCIES. SOME PUBLIC

04:39:23.113 --> 04:39:24.814
GUARDIANS CONSERVATORS OF L. A.

04:39:26.616 --> 04:39:27.784
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL

04:39:27.851 --> 04:39:30.286
HEALTH- AND THEY CAN. ACCESS THE

04:39:30.353 --> 04:39:32.522
EFFICIENCIES AND THE FUNDING

04:39:32.589 --> 04:39:34.824

04:39:34.891 --> 04:39:36.726
THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH-

04:39:36.793 --> 04:39:38.761
BUT THE CONSERVE GUARDIANS AND

04:39:38.828 --> 04:39:40.897
CONSERVATORS THOSE STYLES.ARE

04:39:40.964 --> 04:39:44.868

COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND THE

05:16:21.729 --> 05:16:23.597
REASON IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF.

PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES THAT ARE

05:16:25.032 --> 05:16:27.034

ARE ON FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS.

05:16:31.005 --> 05:16:32.039
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE TAKEN

05:16:32.106 --> 05:16:33.574
AN OVERDOSE OR HAVE COAL MORBID

05:16:33.641 --> 05:16:35.776

PROBLEMS OR THEY'RE SO

05:16:36.844 --> 05:16:38.746
AGGRESSIVE OR AGITATED. THAT

05:16:38.813 --> 05:16:40.715
THEY'RE JUST TOO ACUTE FOR A

05:16:40.781 --> 05:16:42.216
COMMUNITY DROP IN A VOLUNTARY

05:16:42.283 --> 05:16:44.118
PROGRAM. DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD

05:16:44.185 --> 05:16:46.187
BE DENYING THEM HELP. ONCE THEY

05:16:46.253 --> 05:16:47.955

HOSPITAL OR NOT. BUT WHAT WE'VE

05:16:59.667 --> 05:17:01.402
ABLE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IS IF WE

05:17:01.469 --> 05:17:03.537
ACTUALLY INITIATE. CRISIS

05:17:03.604 --> 05:17:05.206
STABILIZATION AT THAT EMERGENCY

05:17:05.272 --> 05:17:07.074
LEVEL OF CARE. IN THE HOSPITAL

05:17:07.141 --> 05:17:09.176

WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN A LOT

05:17:15.950 --> 05:17:17.885
OF HOSPITALS IN THE COUNTRY IN

05:17:17.952 --> 05:17:19.353
THE CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE IS

SOMETHING CALLED BOARDING. AND

05:17:21.188 --> 05:17:22.957
THAT IS A FIFTY ONE FIFTY

05:17:23.023 --> 05:17:24.692
PATIENT COMES IN. THE HOSPITAL

05:17:24.759 --> 05:17:26.327
DOES A MEDICAL CLEARANCE EXAMINE

05:17:26.394 --> 05:17:28.162
THE E. D. AND THEN THE PATIENT

05:17:28.229 --> 05:17:30.164
SITS AND WAITS. AND THEY'RE

05:17:30.231 --> 05:17:31.298
WAITING SOMETIMES FOR AN

05:17:31.365 --> 05:17:33.701
EVALUATION BY A COUNTY PERSON TO

HELPED AT ALL THERE'S NO

05:17:47.148 --> 05:17:48.282
TREATMENT EXCEPT MAYBE

05:17:48.349 --> 05:17:49.984
OCCASIONALLY SOME SEDATION.

05:17:50.050 --> 05:17:51.152
THEY'RE USUALLY STUCK WITH A

05:17:51.218 --> 05:17:52.686
SITTER OR SECURITY GUARD.

05:17:52.753 --> 05:17:54.088
SOMETIMES THEY'RE STRAPPED TO A

05:17:54.155 --> 05:17:56.590
GURNEY AND PUT IN A HALLWAY. AND

05:17:56.657 --> 05:17:58.225
AS WE'VE SAID BEFORE THE

05:17:58.292 --> 05:17:59.460
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ITSELF CAN

05:17:59.527 --> 05:18:02.363
BE. A BAD ENVIRONMENT FOR FOLKS

05:18:02.430 --> 05:18:03.030
AND ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR SYMPTOMS

05:18:03.097 --> 05:18:04.799
WORSE DURING THAT TIME. AND WHEN

05:18:04.865 --> 05:18:05.833
THEY'RE BOARDING THAT'S EVEN

05:18:05.900 --> 05:18:07.168
THAT MUCH WORSE AND SO SOMETIMES

05:18:07.234 --> 05:18:09.737

KNOW ABOUT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS

05:19:09.797 --> 05:19:11.866
FEDERAL LAW. I SURE MOST OF YOU

05:19:11.932 --> 05:19:13.534
KNOW THIS BUT JUST TO REITERATE.

05:19:13.601 --> 05:19:15.703
EMTALA IS THE FEDERAL LAW THAT

05:19:15.769 --> 05:19:18.138
ANYBODY COMES TO E. R. MUST BE

05:19:18.205 --> 05:19:20.074
SEEN. THEY MUST BE EVALUATED SEE

05:19:20.140 --> 05:19:21.342
IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL

05:19:21.408 --> 05:19:22.610
CONDITION AND IF SO THEY NEED TO

05:19:22.676 --> 05:19:24.211
HAVE THAT CONDITION STABILIZED

05:19:24.278 --> 05:19:25.212
OR THE NEED TO BE ADMITTED TO A

05:19:25.279 --> 05:19:27.515
HOSPITAL. FEDERAL LAW THE INTEL

05:19:27.581 --> 05:19:29.517
LAW SAYS THAT PSYCHIATRIC

05:19:29.583 --> 05:19:30.885
EMERGENCIES ARE MEDICAL

05:19:30.951 --> 05:19:33.521
EMERGENCIES. AND SO. THEY NEED

05:19:33.587 --> 05:19:34.989
TO BE EVALUATED AND ATTEMPTED TO

05:19:35.055 --> 05:19:36.323
STABILIZE IN THAT SAME WAY WERE

05:19:36.390 --> 05:19:37.591
ADMITTED TRADITIONALLY THEY'VE

05:19:37.658 --> 05:19:38.692
JUST BEEN TRYING TO ADMIT THOSE

05:19:38.759 --> 05:19:40.628
FOLKS. BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT

05:19:40.694 --> 05:19:42.029
WE CAN ACTUALLY STABILIZE HIM IN

05:19:42.096 --> 05:19:44.899
THE E. R. AS WELL. AND IF WE

05:19:44.965 --> 05:19:46.400
LOOK AT THEM AS MEDICAL

05:19:46.467 --> 05:19:47.735
EMERGENCIES WHICH THE FEDERAL

05:19:47.801 --> 05:19:50.004
GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY ARE. THEN

05:19:50.070 --> 05:19:51.872

BELONG HERE. YOU SHOULD BE

05:19:56.076 --> 05:19:57.878
SOMEWHERE ELSE. DISEASES THE

05:19:57.945 --> 05:19:59.680
BRAIN DON'T BELONG HERE. THERE'S

05:19:59.747 --> 05:20:00.481
BEEN SEVERAL OTHER SPEAKERS

05:20:00.548 --> 05:20:02.082

THESE ARE ACTUALLY DISEASES OF

05:20:14.194 --> 05:20:15.930
THE BRAIN TISSUE. AND IF WE LOOK

05:20:15.996 --> 05:20:17.264
AT THEM AS MEDICAL ISSUES AND

05:20:17.331 --> 05:20:18.666
REALIZE THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE

WHO REALLY NEED OUR HELP AT THE

05:20:20.034 --> 05:20:21.535
ER. MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO

05:20:21.602 --> 05:20:23.971
UNDERSTAND. WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE

05:20:24.038 --> 05:20:25.139
FOR SERIOUS SERIOUS LEVEL

05:20:25.205 --> 05:20:28.208

IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE BACKING UP IN

05:20:34.882 --> 05:20:36.951

MORE INPATIENT BEDS AND WE CAN

05:20:38.652 --> 05:20:39.820
TRANSFER THEM TO AND THAT WILL

05:20:39.887 --> 05:20:40.955
CLEAR OUT THE E. OURS BUT THAT

05:20:41.021 --> 05:20:42.489
PERPETUATES THAT SAME SYSTEM

05:20:42.556 --> 05:20:44.058
LIKE I WAS SAYING WITH THE

05:20:44.124 --> 05:20:46.427
ASTHMA ATTACK WHERE. LET'S JUST

05:20:46.493 --> 05:20:47.995
HAVE YOU SIT AND WAIT UNTIL WE

05:20:48.062 --> 05:20:49.730
FIND SOMETHING ELSEWHERE AND WE

05:20:49.797 --> 05:20:51.532
DON'T DO THAT FOR ANY OTHER KIND

05:20:51.599 --> 05:20:53.701
OF MEDICAL EMERGENCY. THAT WE

05:20:53.767 --> 05:20:56.003
SEE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.

05:20:56.070 --> 05:20:56.971
IN FACT IF WE COMPARED IT TO

05:20:57.037 --> 05:20:58.973
CHEST PAIN. IF YOU CAME INTO THE

05:20:59.039 --> 05:21:00.207
R. WITH CHEST PAIN YOU THINK YOU

05:21:00.274 --> 05:21:01.642
MIGHT BE HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

05:21:01.709 --> 05:21:04.411
ONLY 10220% OF THOSE FOLKS END

05:21:04.478 --> 05:21:06.347
UP GETTING HOSPITALIZED. AND IN

05:21:06.413 --> 05:21:07.915
FACT IF WE ACTUALLY INITIATE

05:21:07.982 --> 05:21:09.350
THAT SAME KIND OF STABILIZING

05:21:09.416 --> 05:21:11.085
EVALUATION AND TREATMENT. AT

05:21:11.151 --> 05:21:12.286
THAT EMERGENCY LEVEL CARE WE

05:21:12.353 --> 05:21:13.821
FIND THAT WE CAN DO THE SAME

05:21:13.887 --> 05:21:16.056
KIND OF STABILIZING CARE. AND

05:21:16.123 --> 05:21:17.224
GET FOLKS HOME IN LESS THAN

05:21:17.291 --> 05:21:18.559
TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE PSYCHIATRIC

05:21:18.626 --> 05:21:19.927
EMERGENCIES THE SAME WAY WE CAN

05:21:19.994 --> 05:21:22.229
WITH MEDICAL EMERGENCIES. NEXT

05:21:22.296 --> 05:21:24.732
SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE KEY ABOUT

05:21:24.798 --> 05:21:26.233
THIS IS THAT WE NEED TO REALIZE

05:21:26.300 --> 05:21:27.701
THERE'S A SPECTRUM OF KERR AND

05:21:27.768 --> 05:21:28.669
I'VE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT

05:21:28.736 --> 05:21:30.804
THIS TODAY. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

05:21:30.871 --> 05:21:32.306
APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE IN

05:21:32.373 --> 05:21:34.808
THE COMMUNITY FOR. MILD TO

05:21:34.875 --> 05:21:36.810
MODERATE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

05:21:36.877 --> 05:21:38.445
WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS CARE

05:21:38.512 --> 05:21:40.714
VOLUNTARILY. THAT'S ALWAYS OUR

05:21:40.781 --> 05:21:42.116
FIRST CHOICE WE DON'T WANT

05:21:42.182 --> 05:21:43.817
ANYBODY TO BE ON A FIFTY ONE

05:21:43.884 --> 05:21:45.019
FIFTY IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE.

05:21:45.085 --> 05:21:46.720
BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE TO VERY

05:21:46.787 --> 05:21:47.921
SEVERE LEVEL OF CARE YOU

05:21:47.988 --> 05:21:48.756
WOULDN'T EXPECT THAT IF YOU'RE

05:21:48.822 --> 05:21:50.357
IN A CAR ACCIDENT. THAT WOULD

05:21:50.424 --> 05:21:52.326
THEY WOULD TAKE YOU TO THE- THE

05:21:52.393 --> 05:21:54.628
DROP IN. URGENT CARE NEXT TO THE

05:21:54.695 --> 05:21:56.330
WALGREENS. YOU'D WANT TO GO TO

05:21:56.397 --> 05:21:57.564
THE TRAUMA CENTER WHERE THE

05:21:57.631 --> 05:21:58.766
TRAUMA SURGEON CAN HELP YOU OUT

05:21:58.832 --> 05:22:00.200
CORRECT. IT'S THE SAME KIND OF

05:22:00.267 --> 05:22:01.969
THING WITH SEVERE SEVERE. MENTAL

05:22:02.036 --> 05:22:03.237
ILLNESS WE NEED DIFFERENT LEVELS

05:22:03.303 --> 05:22:05.572
OF CURE ACUITY AND SOMETIMES

05:22:05.639 --> 05:22:08.442
THAT HOSPITAL ER IS INDEED THE

05:22:08.509 --> 05:22:10.911
RIGHT PLACE. NEXT SLIDE. SO WHAT

05:22:10.978 --> 05:22:12.746
HAVE WE HAD TRADITIONALLY THAT'S

05:22:12.813 --> 05:22:14.548
AVAILABLE AT THAT HOSPITAL

05:22:14.615 --> 05:22:17.317
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BEST CASE

05:22:17.384 --> 05:22:18.719
SCENARIO IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE

05:22:18.786 --> 05:22:20.254
SOMEBODY STATIONED THERE WHO CAN

05:22:20.320 --> 05:22:21.789
HELP YOU OUT A MENTAL HEALTH

05:22:21.855 --> 05:22:22.723
PROFESSIONAL WHO CAN DO AN

05:22:22.790 --> 05:22:24.658
EVALUATION THERE MAY EVEN BE A

05:22:24.725 --> 05:22:26.293
MENTAL HEALTH NURSE PRACTITIONER

05:22:26.360 --> 05:22:28.562
PSYCHIATRIST THERE. DID THE

05:22:28.629 --> 05:22:30.330
UNFORTUNATE THING IS THAT MOSTLY

05:22:30.397 --> 05:22:31.899
AND EVEN SOMETIMES THEY'LL HAVE

05:22:31.965 --> 05:22:33.767
THE COUNTY WILL HAVE SOMEBODY

05:22:33.834 --> 05:22:34.568
WILL COME AND HELP FOLKS OUT

05:22:34.635 --> 05:22:36.437
THERE. THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS

05:22:36.503 --> 05:22:38.038
THAT REALLY THEY AREN'T DOING

05:22:38.105 --> 05:22:39.940
MUCH BEYOND DECIDING WHETHER OR

05:22:40.007 --> 05:22:41.675
NOT YOU'RE APPROPRIATE TO BE

05:22:41.742 --> 05:22:42.476
TRANSFERRED TO AN INPATIENT

05:22:42.543 --> 05:22:44.878

BACK HOME LET'S PLUG YOU INTO

05:22:48.148 --> 05:22:50.250
COMMUNITY SERVICES. MORE LIKELY

05:22:50.317 --> 05:22:51.418
THEY'RE GONNA SAY IT LOOKS LIKE

05:22:51.485 --> 05:22:52.619
YOU'RE HAVING SEVERE ILLNESS

05:22:52.686 --> 05:22:54.188
LET'S START TRYING TO FIND AN

05:22:54.254 --> 05:22:56.323
APPROPRIATE. INPATIENT HOSPITAL

05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:57.925
TO TRANSFER YOU TO AND WE'RE

05:22:57.991 --> 05:22:59.893
GOING TO AUTHORIZES. THE MISSING

05:22:59.960 --> 05:23:02.162
PIECE THE BIG HUGE DONUT HOLE IN

05:23:02.229 --> 05:23:03.030
THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WHEN WE'RE

05:23:03.097 --> 05:23:04.865
DOING IT THAT WAY AS- WHAT ABOUT

05:23:04.932 --> 05:23:06.467
INITIATING TREATMENT WHAT ABOUT

05:23:06.533 --> 05:23:09.336
ACTUALLY. STARTING CARE WHILE

05:23:09.403 --> 05:23:11.038
THEY'RE IN THAT EMERGENCY LEVEL.

05:23:11.105 --> 05:23:12.639
AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE

05:23:12.706 --> 05:23:14.007
BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK AND

05:23:14.074 --> 05:23:15.209
OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND ITS

05:23:15.275 --> 05:23:16.810
THE BIGGEST MISSING PIECE IN OUR

05:23:16.877 --> 05:23:18.378
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IS WHY

05:23:18.445 --> 05:23:20.047
AREN'T WE INITIATING CARE WHEN

05:23:20.114 --> 05:23:22.449
SOMEBODY'S IN THAT EMERGENCY YOU

05:23:22.516 --> 05:23:24.451
LEVEL AND REALLY REALLY NEEDS

05:23:24.518 --> 05:23:26.487
HELP. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO

05:23:26.553 --> 05:23:28.122
INITIATE THAT EMERGENCY CARE WE

05:23:28.188 --> 05:23:29.456
DO WE IF WE FOLLOW WHAT ARE

05:23:29.523 --> 05:23:30.858
KNOWN AMONG US AND EMERGENCY

05:23:30.924 --> 05:23:32.493
PSYCHIATRY'S THE SIX GOALS ARE

05:23:32.559 --> 05:23:34.128
RUMORED TO SEE PSYCHIATRIC CARE.

05:23:34.194 --> 05:23:35.562
AND REAL QUICKLY IT'S GOING TO

05:23:35.629 --> 05:23:36.330
GO THROUGH THESE BECAUSE THIS IS

05:23:36.396 --> 05:23:37.698
THE BASIS FOR THE WHOLE NEXT

05:23:37.765 --> 05:23:39.066
PART AND MAKE IT ALL MUCH MAKE

05:23:39.133 --> 05:23:41.301
MUCH MORE SENSE. FIRST OF ALL

05:23:41.368 --> 05:23:42.703
YOU NEED TO EXCLUDE MEDICALLY

05:23:42.770 --> 05:23:43.871
THE ALLERGIES AND SURE MEDICAL

05:23:43.937 --> 05:23:45.773
STABILITY WHEN SOMEBODY'S HAVING

05:23:45.839 --> 05:23:48.275
A SEVERE MEDICAL EMERGENCY- THE

05:23:48.342 --> 05:23:49.610
MEDICAL PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY

05:23:49.676 --> 05:23:51.311
MAYBE IT'S HALLUCINATIONS MAYBE

05:23:51.378 --> 05:23:53.313
SEVERE SUICIDALITY. SEVERE

05:23:53.380 --> 05:23:55.315
ANXIETY YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE

05:23:55.382 --> 05:23:56.717
THAT THE FIRST OFF THAT THIS IS

05:23:56.784 --> 05:23:58.852
NOT. DUE TO A MEDICAL CONDITION

05:23:58.919 --> 05:24:01.021
WISE THAT. BASED ON WHICH STUDY

05:24:01.088 --> 05:24:03.423
LOOK AT ANYWHERE FROM 10225% OF

05:24:03.490 --> 05:24:05.058
PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES. ARE

05:24:05.125 --> 05:24:07.194
EITHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT

05:24:07.261 --> 05:24:08.962
ARE MIMICKING WHAT APPEAR TO BE

05:24:09.029 --> 05:24:10.931
PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS FOR. A

05:24:10.998 --> 05:24:12.466
PSYCHIATRIC TO GET CONDITION IS

05:24:12.533 --> 05:24:14.902
BEING EXACERBATED BY A MEDICAL

05:24:14.968 --> 05:24:16.036
CONDITION. AND THOSE ARE

05:24:16.103 --> 05:24:17.204
SOMETIMES LIFE THREATENING

05:24:17.271 --> 05:24:18.839
SOMETIMES HEAD TRAUMA WITH IT

05:24:18.906 --> 05:24:20.340
BREATHE BLEEDING INSIDE THE

05:24:20.407 --> 05:24:23.110
BRAIN CAN LOOK LIKE- SOMEBODY IS

05:24:23.177 --> 05:24:25.212
JUST CONFUSED OR DISORIENTED.

05:24:25.279 --> 05:24:26.847
SOMETIMES SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE.

05:24:26.914 --> 05:24:28.348
ABNORMALITIES IN THEIR THYROID

05:24:28.415 --> 05:24:29.883
GLAND OR THEY MAY HAVE A TIME TO

05:24:29.950 --> 05:24:30.984
TALK TO DRUM THEY'VE INGESTED

05:24:31.051 --> 05:24:32.586
POISON. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

05:24:32.653 --> 05:24:33.887
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAN LOOK

05:24:33.954 --> 05:24:35.455
LIKE PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. AND

05:24:35.522 --> 05:24:36.790
I THERE'S TOO MANY STORIES OF

05:24:36.857 --> 05:24:37.991
PEOPLE SAYING OH THIS IS JUST

05:24:38.058 --> 05:24:39.793
LIKE SEND THEM FOR COUNSELLING.

05:24:39.860 --> 05:24:41.094
AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A VERY

05:24:41.161 --> 05:24:42.663
VERY SEVERE MEDICAL CONDITION

05:24:42.729 --> 05:24:44.832
AND BAD BAD OUTCOMES. SO WE WANT

05:24:44.898 --> 05:24:46.700
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- DON'T JUST

05:24:46.767 --> 05:24:47.768
ASSUME THAT SOMEBODY NEEDS

05:24:47.835 --> 05:24:49.870
COUNSELING AS I HEARD SOMEBODY

05:24:49.937 --> 05:24:51.071
MENTIONED BEFORE BUT THAT THESE

05:24:51.138 --> 05:24:52.739
ARE SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC MEDICAL.

05:24:52.806 --> 05:24:54.408
CONDITIONS AND WE GIVE SOMEBODY

05:24:54.474 --> 05:24:56.543
A GOOD MEDICAL EVALUATION ONCE

05:24:56.610 --> 05:24:58.212
WE ARE INSURE THAT THIS IS

05:24:58.278 --> 05:25:00.380
INDEED. APPEAR PSYCHIATRIC

05:25:00.447 --> 05:25:02.015
EMERGENCY AND THAT WE'VE RULED

05:25:02.082 --> 05:25:04.585
OUT ALL THE NON. NON PSYCHIATRIC

05:25:04.651 --> 05:25:06.086
MEDICAL CONDITIONS WE WANT TO

05:25:06.153 --> 05:25:07.554
RAPIDLY STABILIZE THE ACUTE

05:25:07.621 --> 05:25:09.489
CRISIS THE ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC

05:25:09.556 --> 05:25:11.024
EMERGENCY CONDITION. AND I THINK

05:25:11.091 --> 05:25:12.726
THAT IT TOO OFTEN HISTORICALLY

05:25:12.793 --> 05:25:14.061
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS HAVE KIND

05:25:14.127 --> 05:25:15.796
OF PUT PSYCH PATIENTS ON THE

05:25:15.863 --> 05:25:17.364
BACK BURNER. MAKES SENSE OF

05:25:17.431 --> 05:25:18.365
SOMEBODY'S COMING IN WITH A

05:25:18.432 --> 05:25:19.967
HEART ATTACK OR CAR ACCIDENT.

05:25:20.033 --> 05:25:21.835
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A

05:25:21.902 --> 05:25:26.039
RECOGNITION ABOUT HOW SERIOUS I

05:25:26.106 --> 05:25:26.673
AFTER CONDITIONS CAN BE. BECAUSE

05:25:26.740 --> 05:25:27.774
FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE LISTENING

05:25:27.841 --> 05:25:29.576
RIGHT NOW CAN WE POSSIBLY

05:25:29.643 --> 05:25:31.411
IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO

05:25:31.478 --> 05:25:33.580
BE SO SUICIDAL. THAT YOU DON'T

05:25:33.647 --> 05:25:35.215
WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER BREATH. AND

05:25:35.282 --> 05:25:36.450
YOU JUST WANT TO DIE YOU JUST

05:25:36.516 --> 05:25:37.918
WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE OVER WHAT

05:25:37.985 --> 05:25:39.319
CAN I FEEL LIKE I HOPE NONE OF

05:25:39.386 --> 05:25:40.754
US EVER HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT

05:25:40.821 --> 05:25:43.223
FEELING. OR HOW ABOUT HEARING

05:25:43.290 --> 05:25:43.924
VOICES IN YOUR HEAD THAT ARE

05:25:43.991 --> 05:25:46.260
TELLING YOU. TO KILL YOUR FAMILY

05:25:46.326 --> 05:25:49.429
MEMBERS. AND WHAT WHAT MUST THAT

05:25:49.496 --> 05:25:50.797
BE LIKE THAT MUST BE LIKE THE

05:25:50.864 --> 05:25:51.932
MOST AWFUL THING YOU COULD

05:25:51.999 --> 05:25:53.634
POSSIBLY IMAGINE. AND THOSE ARE

05:25:53.700 --> 05:25:55.535
REAL VOICES THEY'RE HEARING IF

05:25:55.602 --> 05:25:57.070
YOU DID A BRAIN SCAN. OF

05:25:57.137 --> 05:25:58.105
SOMEBODY WHO'S WITH

05:25:58.171 --> 05:25:59.273
SCHIZOPHRENIC WHO'S HEARING

05:25:59.339 --> 05:26:00.874
VOICES. THE SAME PART OF THEIR

05:26:00.941 --> 05:26:02.142
BRAIN THAT WOULD LIGHT UP YOU

05:26:02.209 --> 05:26:03.677
HEARING ME TALK RIGHT NOW.

05:26:03.744 --> 05:26:04.578
LIGHTS UP WITH THEM THEY'RE

05:26:04.645 --> 05:26:06.413
LITERALLY HEARING VOICES. AND

05:26:06.480 --> 05:26:07.614
THEY DON'T WANT TO ACT ON THOSE

05:26:07.681 --> 05:26:10.250
VOICES. BUT IT MUST BE SO.

05:26:10.317 --> 05:26:12.686
DIFFICULT AND IS THAT AS BAD. AS

05:26:12.753 --> 05:26:14.254
AS BEING YOU KNOW HAVING A

05:26:14.321 --> 05:26:16.056
BROKEN ARM. MAYBE THEY NEED TO

05:26:16.123 --> 05:26:18.959
BE PRIORITIZED. AND SO YOU KNOW

05:26:19.026 --> 05:26:21.028
I HAD COLLEAGUES SAY TO ME. YOU

05:26:21.094 --> 05:26:23.063
KNOW SCOTT THE ONE THING ABOUT

05:26:23.130 --> 05:26:24.498
PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES WE DON'T

05:26:24.564 --> 05:26:25.699
HAVE A BLOOD TEST THAT PROVES

05:26:25.766 --> 05:26:26.700
THAT SOMEBODY'S HAVING PSYCH

05:26:26.767 --> 05:26:28.402
EMERGENCY WE DON'T HAVE AN- X.

05:26:28.468 --> 05:26:29.336
RAY THAT PROVES THERE'S PSYCH

05:26:29.403 --> 05:26:31.505
EMERGENCY. AND I SAID YEAH. BUT

05:26:31.571 --> 05:26:33.206
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T HAVE. A

05:26:33.273 --> 05:26:36.376
BLOOD TEST OR AN X. RAY TO PROVE

05:26:36.443 --> 05:26:37.811
EITHER. PAIN WE ALL KNOW WHAT

05:26:37.878 --> 05:26:44.885
PAIN FEELS LIKE. SO MAYBE. I'VE

05:26:44.952 --> 05:26:46.954
WE ALL KNOW WHAT PAIN IS. SO

THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO THINK

05:27:00.934 --> 05:27:02.135
ABOUT PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCIES

05:27:02.202 --> 05:27:03.270
BECAUSE THAT'S OUR PATIENTS ARE

05:27:03.337 --> 05:27:04.938
FEELING. AND WHEN WE DO HELP

05:27:05.005 --> 05:27:06.540
THEM WE WANT TO AVOID COERCION

05:27:06.606 --> 05:27:08.709
TO MUCH OF. HISTORIC PSYCHIATRIC

05:27:08.775 --> 05:27:10.310
EMERGENCY CARE HAS BEEN ABOUT.

05:27:10.377 --> 05:27:11.278
I'M THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE

05:27:11.345 --> 05:27:12.512
PATIENT SHUT UP WE'RE GOING TO

YOU A SHOT. WE WANT TO GET RID

05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:16.516
OF THAT. INSTEAD FORMA

05:27:16.583 --> 05:27:17.951
THERAPEUTICS ALLIANCE WHERE IT'S

05:27:18.018 --> 05:27:19.786
ALL ABOUT COLLABORATION NOT

05:27:19.853 --> 05:27:21.288
COERCION. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A

05:27:21.355 --> 05:27:22.656
TOUGH TIME LET'S GET YOU THROUGH

05:27:22.723 --> 05:27:24.825
THIS. YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. AND

05:27:24.891 --> 05:27:26.326
THAT MEANS TREAT IN THE LEAST

05:27:26.393 --> 05:27:29.396
RESTRICTIVE SETTING. AND SO MUCH

05:27:29.463 --> 05:27:30.797
OF OUR HISTORIC APPROACH HAS

05:27:30.864 --> 05:27:32.499
BEEN THE BEST THING WE CAN DO

05:27:32.566 --> 05:27:33.333
FOR YOU IS FIND YOU AN INPATIENT

05:27:33.400 --> 05:27:35.202
PSYCH BED. BUT IN ALL

05:27:35.268 --> 05:27:36.570
SERIOUSNESS WHO WOULD REALLY

05:27:36.636 --> 05:27:37.371
WANT TO BE LOCKED INTO A

05:27:37.437 --> 05:27:39.573
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL

05:27:39.639 --> 05:27:41.808
DAYS. AGAINST YOUR WILL. UNLESS

05:27:41.875 --> 05:27:44.077
YOU REALLY REALLY NEEDED IT. IF

05:27:44.144 --> 05:27:45.512
THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE WE WANT

05:27:45.579 --> 05:27:46.747
TO GO IN THE OTHER DIRECTION

05:27:46.813 --> 05:27:48.015
WHERE THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE

05:27:48.081 --> 05:27:49.216
SETTING WHERE WE'RE BEING LOCKED

05:27:49.282 --> 05:27:50.684
INTO RESTRAINTS IS PROBABLY THE

05:27:50.751 --> 05:27:52.719
MOST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. NEXT

05:27:52.786 --> 05:27:55.589
MOST RESTRICTED BE JUST LOCKED

05:27:55.655 --> 05:27:56.456
INSIDE OF A HOSPITAL. LET'S KEEP

05:27:56.523 --> 05:27:57.691
MOVING TOWARDS THE LEAST

05:27:57.758 --> 05:27:59.092
RESTRICTIVE SETTING WHICH IS ME

05:27:59.159 --> 05:28:00.560
BEING HOME ABLE TO COME AND GO

05:28:00.627 --> 05:28:01.595
AS YOU PLEASE MAKE YOUR OWN

05:28:01.661 --> 05:28:03.730
DECISIONS FEELING SAFE. THAT'S

05:28:03.797 --> 05:28:04.831
THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO AND

05:28:04.898 --> 05:28:06.800
SO. THE IDEA THAT THE SOLUTION

05:28:06.867 --> 05:28:08.802
IS ALWAYS IMPATIENT. IS ACTUALLY

05:28:08.869 --> 05:28:10.137
THE OPPOSITE OF THAT I THINK THE

05:28:10.203 --> 05:28:11.972
BEST WAY WE CAN HELP SOMEBODY.

05:28:12.039 --> 05:28:13.240
AND WHEN WE ARE ABLE TO DO ALL

05:28:13.306 --> 05:28:14.741
THESE THINGS. WE WANT TO GET

05:28:14.808 --> 05:28:16.376
SOMEBODY BACK HOME BACK TO THE

05:28:16.443 --> 05:28:19.112
COMMUNITY. AND IN DOING SO WE

05:28:19.179 --> 05:28:20.547
WANT TO HAVE A REALLY GOOD WARM

05:28:20.614 --> 05:28:22.049
HAND OFF TO COMMUNITY SERVICES

05:28:22.115 --> 05:28:23.450
AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE GETTING

05:28:23.517 --> 05:28:25.352
PEOPLE CONNECTED. AND NOT JUST

05:28:25.419 --> 05:28:27.154
OPENING THE DOOR TO THE ER AND

05:28:27.220 --> 05:28:28.555
SAYING HERE'S A PAMPHLET. BUT

05:28:28.622 --> 05:28:29.756
ACTUALLY CONNECTING THEM TO

05:28:29.823 --> 05:28:31.825
SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT.

05:28:31.892 --> 05:28:33.994
THE PEOPLE GET OUT AND- DON'T

05:28:34.061 --> 05:28:35.495
HAVE TO COME BACK AGAIN MY GOAL

05:28:35.562 --> 05:28:37.030
AS AN EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRIST HAS

05:28:37.097 --> 05:28:38.698
ALWAYS BEEN TO PUT MYSELF OUT OF

05:28:38.765 --> 05:28:40.934
WORK. BY DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB.

05:28:41.001 --> 05:28:41.701
THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE AN

05:28:41.768 --> 05:28:43.804
EMERGENCY SITUATION OR CRISIS

05:28:43.870 --> 05:28:46.406
AGAIN NEXT SLIDE. SO THE MODEL

05:28:46.473 --> 05:28:47.741
THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED THAT

05:28:47.808 --> 05:28:49.976
REALLY REFLECTS. ALL OF THESE

05:28:50.043 --> 05:28:52.145
CONCEPTS IS CALLED THE M. PATH

05:28:52.212 --> 05:28:54.214
MODEL AND M. PATTERSON ACRONYM

05:28:54.281 --> 05:28:55.215
STANDS FOR EMERGENCY

05:28:55.282 --> 05:28:56.983
PSYCHIATRIC. ASSESSMENT

05:28:57.050 --> 05:28:59.920
TREATMENT AND HEALING. FACILITY

05:28:59.986 --> 05:29:01.621
AND THESE ARE LIKE ICY USE

05:29:01.688 --> 05:29:03.390
ADJACENT TO EMERGENCY

05:29:03.457 --> 05:29:05.358
DEPARTMENTS. THAT PEOPLE CAN BE

05:29:05.425 --> 05:29:07.994
SWIFTLY MOVED OUT OF THE E. R.

05:29:08.061 --> 05:29:11.098
RIGHT INTO A MORE APPROPRIATE.

05:29:11.164 --> 05:29:12.999
YOU KNOW THERAPEUTIC SETTING.

05:29:13.066 --> 05:29:14.367
THAT STILL THAT SAME LEVEL OF

05:29:14.434 --> 05:29:15.702
CARE THAT STEAM EMERGENCY

05:29:15.769 --> 05:29:17.671
HOSPITAL DEPARTMENT. LEVEL OF

05:29:17.737 --> 05:29:19.806
CARE. BUT IT'S DESIGNED REALLY

05:29:19.873 --> 05:29:21.875
FOR. THE KIND OF EMERGENCIES

05:29:21.942 --> 05:29:23.076
THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING A PSYCHE

05:29:23.143 --> 05:29:24.111
AFTER MONTHS YOU'RE GOING

05:29:24.177 --> 05:29:25.879
THROUGH. AND WHAT WE FIND IS

05:29:25.946 --> 05:29:27.180
THAT IF WE GET PEOPLE INTO A

05:29:27.247 --> 05:29:29.483
SETTING LIKE THIS. THAT OF THE

05:29:29.549 --> 05:29:31.685
PEOPLE WHO WE WOULD HAVE HELD TO

05:29:31.751 --> 05:29:32.686
GO TO AN INPATIENT FACILITY

05:29:32.752 --> 05:29:35.856
BEFORE. 75280% OF THEM WE CAN

05:29:35.922 --> 05:29:37.791
GET BETTER AND STABLE. AND GET

05:29:37.858 --> 05:29:39.726
BACK HOME IN LESS THAN TWENTY

05:29:39.793 --> 05:29:42.329
FOUR HOURS. IT'S JUST AN AMAZING

05:29:42.395 --> 05:29:44.064
AMAZING TURNAROUND. IT'S AND IF

05:29:44.131 --> 05:29:45.198
YOU SAY LIKE WHAT AT THIS

05:29:45.265 --> 05:29:46.299
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HOW WOULD

05:29:46.366 --> 05:29:47.634
SOMEBODY BE AN E. R. AND WE MOVE

05:29:47.701 --> 05:29:48.435
THEM SOMEWHERE THAT'S THAT'S

05:29:48.502 --> 05:29:50.170
MORE APPROPRIATE WE DON'T DO

05:29:50.237 --> 05:29:51.271
THAT WITH ANYTHING ELSE BUT I

DISTINCT FROM THE MEDICAL YOUR

NEXT NEXT SLIDE. AND THAT DESIGN

05:31:09.449 --> 05:31:11.751
IS. ABOUT BEING SPACIOUS IT'S A

05:31:11.818 --> 05:31:13.720
LARGE OPEN SPACE WHICH WE CALL A

05:31:13.787 --> 05:31:15.522
MILIEU WHERE PATIENTS CAN ALL BE

05:31:15.589 --> 05:31:17.224
TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM. IT

05:31:17.290 --> 05:31:18.325
MIGHT SEEM COUNTER AND

05:31:18.391 --> 05:31:20.293
INTUITIVE. BUT ACTUALLY HUMAN

05:31:20.360 --> 05:31:22.095
CONTACT IN THOSE FIRST FEW HOURS

05:31:22.162 --> 05:31:24.130
OF A CRISIS. ARE AMAZING FOR

05:31:24.197 --> 05:31:26.299
PEOPLE. WHEN YOU WERE SUICIDAL

05:31:26.366 --> 05:31:27.300
YOU THOUGHT EVERYBODY IN THE

05:31:27.367 --> 05:31:28.602
WORLD HATED YOU IF YOU GET

MAYBE IF YOU'RE PARANOID

05:31:37.611 --> 05:31:38.945
PSYCHOSIS YOU GET LOCKED IN A

05:31:39.012 --> 05:31:39.746
ROOM YOU THINK THE PEOPLE

05:31:39.813 --> 05:31:41.047

05:31:48.355 --> 05:31:50.056
THE NURSING STAFF INTERSPERSED

05:31:50.123 --> 05:31:51.992
AS OPPOSED TO BEING. LOCKED

05:31:52.058 --> 05:31:53.660
BEHIND A BULLETPROOF FISH BOWL

05:31:53.727 --> 05:31:55.495
THAT ARE SEPARATED FROM THE

05:31:55.562 --> 05:31:56.696
PATIENTS. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF

05:31:56.763 --> 05:31:58.965
RESEARCH. THE OPEN SPACE AND THE

05:31:59.032 --> 05:32:00.200
IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO NURSING

05:32:00.267 --> 05:32:02.269
STAFF. REDUCES A LOT OF THE

05:32:02.335 --> 05:32:03.803
ANXIETY. THE ANGER THE

05:32:03.870 --> 05:32:05.305
FRUSTRATION THAT CAUSES

05:32:05.372 --> 05:32:07.474
AGGRESSION. AND VIOLENCE AND

05:32:07.540 --> 05:32:09.709
AGITATION. IT'S ME IT'S JUST THE

05:32:09.776 --> 05:32:11.678

BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL

05:32:15.715 --> 05:32:17.684
PARANOID. A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS.

05:32:17.751 --> 05:32:19.586
NEED TO PACE AROUND FOR EXAMPLE

05:32:19.653 --> 05:32:21.121
TO HELP THEM WORK OFF THEIR-

05:32:21.187 --> 05:32:23.456
AGITATION OR THE ANXIETY. YOU

05:32:23.523 --> 05:32:24.924

PLENTY OF ROOM. TO MOVE ABOUT.

05:32:33.099 --> 05:32:35.101
INSTEAD OF BEING IN A SYMBOL AND

05:32:35.168 --> 05:32:37.270
A SMALL- YOU KNOW OBSERVATION

TREATMENT PLAN WE'RE GONNA SEE

05:35:06.386 --> 05:35:07.554
HOW SOMEBODY DOES FOR A FEW

05:35:07.620 --> 05:35:09.088
HOURS. IN THIS COMFORTABLE

05:35:09.155 --> 05:35:10.824
THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT. MAYBE

THEY'RE GONNA GO SIT AND PLAY A

05:35:11.691 --> 05:35:13.393

WE'RE GONNA SEE THEY'RE DOING

05:35:17.497 --> 05:35:18.765
BETTER WE'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO

05:35:18.832 --> 05:35:21.501

05:35:26.573 --> 05:35:27.907
COURSE TOWARDS GETTING BETTER

05:35:27.974 --> 05:35:29.175
RATHER THAN TRYING TO DECIDE

05:35:29.242 --> 05:35:30.510
ONLY THAT FIRST HOUR WHEN

05:35:30.577 --> 05:35:32.178
THEY'RE AT THEIR WORST. WHAT THE

05:35:32.245 --> 05:35:33.246
DISPOSITION TWENTY FOUR HOURS

05:35:33.313 --> 05:35:34.547
FROM NOW SHOULD BE. WE'RE GOING

05:35:34.614 --> 05:35:36.049
TO CONTINUALLY RE OBSERVE

05:35:36.115 --> 05:35:38.251

05:35:41.821 --> 05:35:43.122
GET SOME REAL BANG FOR THE BUCK

05:35:43.189 --> 05:35:44.791
WHERE IS THE LONGER WE WORK WITH

05:35:44.858 --> 05:35:46.593
THEM. THE MORE LIKELY IT IS

05:35:46.659 --> 05:35:47.293
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING

05:35:47.360 --> 05:35:48.461
BETTER WE CAN START WORKING ON A

05:35:48.528 --> 05:35:50.497
PLAN TO GET THEM BACK HOME. AND

05:35:50.563 --> 05:35:52.265
PLUGGED INTO COMMUNITY PROGRAMS.

05:35:52.332 --> 05:35:53.766
BECAUSE OF THIS WHOLE DESIGN IS

05:35:53.833 --> 05:35:55.768
ALL SET UP TO MAKE IT MORE

05:35:55.835 --> 05:35:57.637
CALMING AND- RELAXED.

05:35:57.704 --> 05:35:59.639
THERAPEUTIC WE HAVE ALMOST

05:35:59.706 --> 05:36:01.441
ELIMINATED THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL

05:36:01.508 --> 05:36:03.510
RESTRAINTS WITH THIS POPULATION.

05:36:03.576 --> 05:36:05.778
WHICH THIS IS A POPULATION THAT.

05:36:05.845 --> 05:36:07.380
THERE THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES THAT

05:36:07.447 --> 05:36:08.581
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE- IS.

05:36:08.648 --> 05:36:10.650
TYPICALLY ABOUT 30% OF THEM

05:36:10.717 --> 05:36:11.618
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN PHYSICAL

05:36:11.684 --> 05:36:13.553
RESTRAINTS. THE AVERAGE EMPAT

05:36:13.620 --> 05:36:15.455
UNIT ACROSS THE NATION. IS

05:36:15.522 --> 05:36:18.057
AVERAGING ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY

05:36:18.124 --> 05:36:18.691
ONE THOUSAND OF THOSE SAME FOLKS

05:36:18.758 --> 05:36:20.560
GOES IN RESTRAINTS. SO INSTEAD

05:36:20.627 --> 05:36:21.895
OF THREE HUNDRED OUT OF A

05:36:21.961 --> 05:36:24.797
THOUSAND IT'S ONE OUT OF A

05:36:24.864 --> 05:36:25.865
THOUSAND. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONE

05:36:25.932 --> 05:36:27.133
EVIDENCE BASED INFORMATION THE

05:36:27.200 --> 05:36:28.401
MOST PRESTIGIOUS EMERGENCY

05:36:28.468 --> 05:36:29.936
MEDICINE JOURNAL CALLED ACADEMIC

05:36:30.003 --> 05:36:31.004
EMERGENCY MEDICINE DID A STUDY

05:36:31.070 --> 05:36:32.605
OF THEIR EMPAT UNIT. AT THE

05:36:32.672 --> 05:36:34.707
UNIVERSITY OF IOWA. HERE'S SOME

05:36:34.774 --> 05:36:35.875
OF THE GREAT METRICS THEY CAME

05:36:35.942 --> 05:36:38.311
OUT WITH. THEY REDUCE THE EASY

05:36:38.378 --> 05:36:40.046
THE OVERALL LENGTH OF STAY OF

05:36:40.113 --> 05:36:43.082
PATIENTS IN THE ER. FROM SIXTEEN

05:36:43.149 --> 05:36:44.918
HOURS TO JUST OVER FOUR HOURS.

05:36:44.984 --> 05:36:46.219
AND THAT'S INCLUDING ALL THE

05:36:46.286 --> 05:36:48.855
TIME IT TOOK THEM TO LIKE. DETOX

05:36:48.922 --> 05:36:50.590
THEM FROM AN OVERDOSE OR OR GET

05:36:50.657 --> 05:36:52.458
THEM THROUGH A WITHDRAWAL OR

05:36:52.525 --> 05:36:53.593
THINGS LIKE THAT SO. THERE'S

05:36:53.660 --> 05:36:54.627
GOING TO BE SOMETIME IN THE E.

05:36:54.694 --> 05:36:55.695
ARE NO MATTER WHAT BUT THEY

05:36:55.762 --> 05:36:57.330
DROPPED ALL THAT BOARDING TIME

05:36:57.397 --> 05:36:59.866
TO ALMOST ZERO. THEY REDUCE THE

05:36:59.933 --> 05:37:01.534
INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC ADMISSIONS

05:37:01.601 --> 05:37:03.369
BY OVER FIFTY PERCENT. BUT

05:37:03.436 --> 05:37:06.306
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE

05:37:06.372 --> 05:37:06.940
WOULDN'T EVEN BEEN OBVIOUS FROM

05:37:07.006 --> 05:37:08.474
THE FIRST POINT. THE FOLLOW UP

05:37:08.541 --> 05:37:09.809
OF THESE FOLKS WANT TO DISCHARGE

05:37:09.876 --> 05:37:11.344
HIM THEY DO SUCH A BETTER JOB OF

05:37:11.411 --> 05:37:12.478
GETTING THEM CONNECTED TO THE

05:37:12.545 --> 05:37:13.713
COMMUNITY THAN EVEN HAD THEY

05:37:13.780 --> 05:37:15.481
BEEN AN IMPATIENT. AND MAYBE

05:37:15.548 --> 05:37:16.816
IT'S ABOUT BEING THERAPEUTIC

05:37:16.883 --> 05:37:19.085
RATHER THAN COERCIVE. BUT THE

05:37:19.152 --> 05:37:20.987
HAD A 60% IMPROVEMENT IN PEOPLE

05:37:21.054 --> 05:37:22.221
FOLLOWING UP WITH THEIR

05:37:22.288 --> 05:37:24.157
OUTPATIENT PLANS. GOING TO THEIR

05:37:24.223 --> 05:37:25.692
OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS THEY

05:37:25.758 --> 05:37:27.827
ACTUALLY WERE DOING BETTER.

05:37:27.894 --> 05:37:29.295
AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THEY HAD A

05:37:29.362 --> 05:37:30.496
BETTER EXPERIENCE IN THEIR

05:37:30.563 --> 05:37:33.099
CRISIS. AND FOR PEOPLE SAY LIKE

05:37:33.166 --> 05:37:34.133
OH IF YOU BUILD SOMETHING LIKE

05:37:34.200 --> 05:37:36.269
THIS THEY WILL COME. AND YOU'RE

05:37:36.336 --> 05:37:37.670
JUST GONNA GET RECIDIVISM AND

05:37:37.737 --> 05:37:39.205
MAYBE YOUR COVER NOT HOLDING

05:37:39.272 --> 05:37:39.806
THEM LONG ENOUGH AND THEY'LL

05:37:39.872 --> 05:37:41.674
JUST HAVE TO COME BACK. ACTUALLY

05:37:41.741 --> 05:37:43.076
WE'VE SEEN JUST THE OPPOSITE AT

05:37:43.142 --> 05:37:43.943
ALL THESE PROGRAMS AROUND THE

05:37:44.010 --> 05:37:45.812
COUNTRY. AND IN THIS PEER

05:37:45.878 --> 05:37:47.947
REVIEWED EVIDENCE BASED JOURNAL.

05:37:48.014 --> 05:37:49.816
THEY SHOWED THAT THE THIRTY DAY

05:37:49.882 --> 05:37:51.517
RETURN OF THESE PATIENTS TO THE

05:37:51.584 --> 05:37:53.553
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ACTUALLY

05:37:53.620 --> 05:37:55.455
DROPPED BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

05:37:55.521 --> 05:37:57.724
THIS IS HAVING THIS PROGRAM OPEN

05:37:57.790 --> 05:37:58.358
FOR YEAR COMPARED TO THE YEAR

05:37:58.424 --> 05:38:00.426
BEFORE THEY OPEN. AND ALL THESE

05:38:00.493 --> 05:38:02.829
THINGS HAPPENED THAT CHANGED

05:38:02.895 --> 05:38:04.831
THESE DYNAMICS AND JUST AMAZING.

05:38:04.897 --> 05:38:06.332
INCLUDING REALLY REDUCING THE

05:38:06.399 --> 05:38:08.001
RECIDIVISM WHICH IS SOMETHING I

05:38:08.067 --> 05:38:08.635
THINK WE ALL LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN

05:38:08.701 --> 05:38:10.269
NEXT SLIDE. UNIVERSITY OF

05:38:10.336 --> 05:38:12.672
MINNESOTA- JUST OPEN ONE UP THIS

05:38:12.739 --> 05:38:14.741
YEAR. IT WITHIN SIX MONTHS THEY

05:38:14.807 --> 05:38:16.409
HAD A FIFTY EIGHT READ 8%

05:38:16.476 --> 05:38:17.677
REDUCTION IN THEIR HOSPITAL

05:38:17.744 --> 05:38:19.078
ADMISSION JUST SEVENTEEN

05:38:19.145 --> 05:38:20.813
PERCENT. OF THE PATIENTS THEY

05:38:20.880 --> 05:38:21.814
ARE SEEING THAT USED TO GO TO

05:38:21.881 --> 05:38:23.549
IMPATIENT. NOW GETTING ADMITTED

05:38:23.616 --> 05:38:26.486
YOU CAN SEE A NICE PICTURE OF

05:38:26.552 --> 05:38:27.353
THEIR UNIT AS WELL NEXT SLIDE.

05:38:27.420 --> 05:38:29.422
SO WHAT ABOUT CALIFORNIA WE DO

THINGS THIS WAY WHICH IS VERY

05:42:29.495 --> 05:42:30.529

SOME COUNTIES HAVE CHOSEN THAT

05:42:54.086 --> 05:42:55.621
THEY WOULD PREFER NOT TO PAY FOR

05:42:55.688 --> 05:42:57.857
THIS LEVEL OF CARE. AND I WOULD

05:42:57.924 --> 05:43:01.727
HOPE THAT AS PART OF THE HEARING

05:43:01.794 --> 05:43:02.361
TODAY WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT.

05:43:02.428 --> 05:43:03.362

YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS THE SAME

05:43:14.540 --> 05:43:16.709

THERE SHOULDN'T BE A DIFFERENT

05:43:22.715 --> 05:43:23.849

SERVICES THERE. SHOULD SAY THAT

05:54:20.572 --> 05:54:21.173
THE THEORY OF

05:54:21.239 --> 05:54:23.108
INSTITUTIONALIZATION STARKLY

05:54:23.175 --> 05:54:24.309
GOING BACK INTO THE NINETEENTH

05:54:24.376 --> 05:54:26.411

SENATE BILL EVOLVED INTO. A

05:54:40.392 --> 05:54:42.327
STUDY LOOKING AT BEST. BUT I

05:54:42.394 --> 05:54:45.030
THINK WE LEARNED IS AS EARLY AS

05:54:45.097 --> 05:54:46.298
THE LATE SIXTIES EARLY SEVENTIES

05:54:46.365 --> 05:54:48.000
WAS IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO ADJUST

05:54:48.066 --> 05:54:49.267
TO THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES. YOU

05:54:49.334 --> 05:54:50.936
NEED TO BE A NETWORK BECAUSE

05:54:51.003 --> 05:54:52.771
ADJUSTING TO AN INSTITUTIONAL

05:54:52.838 --> 05:54:54.740
SETTING AB EVEN IF YOU'RE ABLE

05:54:54.806 --> 05:54:59.378
TO DO IT MANY. PEOPLE THAT

05:54:59.444 --> 05:55:00.112
CHALLENGES AND- WE NOT

05:55:00.178 --> 05:55:02.748
NECESSARILY. AT GIVE ANY

05:55:02.814 --> 05:55:04.549
INDICATION I JUST TOOK HIM SOME

05:55:04.616 --> 05:55:06.418
THE DIFFERENCE OF NORMS

05:55:06.485 --> 05:55:07.753
DIFFERENT SENSE OF IT SAID

05:55:07.819 --> 05:55:09.955
ABSOLUTELY OF THAT ALLOWED TO

05:55:10.022 --> 05:55:12.090
LIVE IN THE OWN IS THE PLACE

05:55:12.157 --> 05:55:13.025
WHERE THEY WILL IF THEY'RE GONNA

05:55:13.091 --> 05:55:15.594
BETTER WERE YEAH. SERVICE AND

05:55:15.661 --> 05:55:23.335
SUPPORT HOUSING INCLUDING STEPS. EXTRA IN IN THE LIVING SO.

05:55:23.402 --> 05:55:24.403
MEDICATION MANAGEMENTSUBSTANCE

05:55:24.469 --> 05:55:25.971

05:55:26.038 --> 05:55:26.638
EMPLOYMENT AND MAINTAINING

05:55:26.705 --> 05:55:28.507
HOUSING HOME HEALTH IS. SO THERE

05:55:28.573 --> 05:55:30.876
MANY I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT AS

05:55:30.942 --> 05:55:32.177
THEY SAY IT TAKES A VILLAGE IN

05:55:32.244 --> 05:55:33.145
THE VILLAGE HERE ARE THE

05:55:33.211 --> 05:55:35.681
DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL. SUPPORTS

05:55:35.747 --> 05:55:36.915
THAT UP EVERY PROVIDE. ANOTHER

05:55:36.982 --> 05:55:38.183
IMPORTANT ELEMENT HERE IS THAT

05:55:38.250 --> 05:55:40.385
OF- PROVIDING MOBILE CRISIS

05:55:40.452 --> 05:55:42.287

05:55:42.354 --> 05:55:42.954
ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO

INSTITUTIONAL CARE AT THE

05:55:44.356 --> 05:55:45.657
PSYCHIATRIC LEVEL BUT

05:55:45.724 --> 05:55:48.860
IMPORTANTLY CAN BE. MULTITUDE OF

05:55:48.927 --> 05:55:51.563
TWO POLICE AND CRIMINALS- A LOT

05:55:51.630 --> 05:55:53.832
PARLIAMENT. OKAY THAT'S

05:55:53.899 --> 05:55:54.933
RIDICULOUS YOU I THINK I'M GONNA

05:55:55.000 --> 05:55:57.102
FIGHT FOR PEOPLE WITH TOM YOUNG

05:55:57.169 --> 05:55:58.970
PEOPLE TO GET PEOPLE OF COLOR I

05:55:59.037 --> 05:56:00.572
MANY OF THEM WIND UP. GETTING

05:56:00.639 --> 05:56:01.440
INTO TROUBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR

05:56:01.506 --> 05:56:03.308
INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE AND

05:56:03.375 --> 05:56:04.943
IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY COULD

05:56:05.010 --> 05:56:05.544
BE TREATED THROUGH THE MOBILE

05:56:05.610 --> 05:56:07.646

WITH THIS POPULATION APPROPRIATE

05:56:12.417 --> 05:56:15.487
WAY. IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS.

05:56:15.554 --> 05:56:17.889

PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS FUTURE. NOT

05:59:00.685 --> 05:59:02.087
ONLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF

05:59:02.153 --> 05:59:03.054
THE KINDS OF ALTERNATIVES THAT

05:59:03.121 --> 05:59:04.589
ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS

05:59:04.656 --> 05:59:05.190

RESEARCH IN SUPPORT. AND

05:59:12.497 --> 05:59:14.532
PRACTICE SUPPORT. THE KEY IS

05:59:14.599 --> 05:59:15.901
COORDINATION AND PROVISION AND

05:59:15.967 --> 05:59:18.103

AGREE WITH THIS. WE HAVE TO I

05:59:25.310 --> 05:59:26.678
THINK GET AWAY FROM THE SENSE OF

05:59:26.745 --> 05:59:28.680
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS BEING

05:59:28.747 --> 05:59:31.449
SOMEHOW WILDLY DISTINCT FROM

05:59:31.516 --> 05:59:33.451
DIVERGING FROM OTHER KINDS OF.

05:59:33.518 --> 05:59:35.186
SOCIAL SERVICES OR MEDICAL AND

05:59:35.253 --> 05:59:36.655
OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES THAT IT

05:59:36.721 --> 05:59:38.056
SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT YOU

05:59:38.123 --> 05:59:39.424
EXPERIENCE AS PART OF IT RATHER

05:59:39.491 --> 05:59:41.359
THAN THE KIND OF SEPARATION. AND

05:59:41.426 --> 05:59:42.994
WE HAVE TO I THINK IN THE END IF

05:59:43.061 --> 05:59:45.297
WE CAN'T GET THERE TODAY WE HAVE

05:59:45.363 --> 05:59:47.432
TO MOVE OVER TIME TO A SITUATION

05:59:47.499 --> 05:59:49.534
WHERE WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR.

05:59:49.601 --> 05:59:51.403
A COURSE OF SERVICES SO IT'S

05:59:51.469 --> 05:59:53.104
VERY EXCITED TO HEAR ABOUT

05:59:53.171 --> 05:59:55.006
REDUCTION IN SUCH. FORMS OF

05:59:55.073 --> 05:59:56.541
INTERVENTION INSTANCE GO STRAINS

05:59:56.608 --> 05:59:59.077
INCLUSION. OTHER ISOLATION OTHER

05:59:59.144 --> 06:00:01.613
KINDS OF WAYS- BECAUSE THOSE ARE

06:00:01.680 --> 06:00:03.915
CAN HAVE SHORT TERM SUCCESS BUT

06:00:03.982 --> 06:00:08.353
NOT LEAD TO LONG TERM SUCCESS.

06:00:08.420 --> 06:00:08.987
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE SHOULD

06:00:09.054 --> 06:00:09.854
BE LOOKING- RETCHING THE

06:00:09.921 --> 06:00:11.289
CRITERIA FOR CIVIL. MAKING IT

06:00:11.356 --> 06:00:13.024
EASIER. TO INVOLVE. CONFINED

06:00:13.091 --> 06:00:15.794
PEOPLE ON HOLD FOR LONGER TERM.

06:00:15.860 --> 06:00:17.395
BASIS IS NOT GOING TO IN THE AND

06:00:17.462 --> 06:00:20.065
STOP THE PROBLEM. EITHER AND NOR

06:00:20.131 --> 06:00:21.933
OF COURSE ISN'T AN APPROACH THAT

06:00:22.000 --> 06:00:23.835
WOULD RESPECT THE AUTONOMY OF

06:00:23.902 --> 06:00:27.005

CONSIDERABLE TIME AND ENERGY ON

06:01:29.567 --> 06:01:31.503
THE CONDITION AND THE CONDITIONS

06:01:31.569 --> 06:01:33.938
UNDER WHICH WE INVOLUNTARILY

06:01:34.005 --> 06:01:36.007
SERVE PEOPLE AND BUT WE HAVEN'T

06:01:36.074 --> 06:01:37.542
NECESSARILY DEDICATED THE

06:01:37.609 --> 06:01:38.843
COMMENSURATE LEVEL OF TIME AND

06:01:38.910 --> 06:01:40.779
ATTENTION ON HOW THOSE SERVICES

06:01:40.845 --> 06:01:42.047
ARE WORKING AND SO YOU HEARD

06:01:42.113 --> 06:01:43.348
SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THIS

06:01:43.415 --> 06:01:45.183
MORNING AROUND DATA CHALLENGES.

06:01:45.250 --> 06:01:47.085
I'M YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH THE

06:01:47.152 --> 06:01:49.421
COMMENTS FROM THAT THAT THE

06:01:49.487 --> 06:01:49.921
PEERS THE FOLKS OF LIVED

06:01:49.988 --> 06:01:54.259
EXPERIENCE. I HAVE HOSTED-

06:01:54.325 --> 06:01:55.460
PANELS. STATE LEVEL PANEL WITH.

06:01:55.527 --> 06:01:57.262
WHO SAID THAT HOSPITALIZATION

06:01:57.328 --> 06:01:59.197
INVOLUNTARY HOSPITALIZATION. WAS

06:01:59.264 --> 06:02:01.699
THE- THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF

06:02:01.766 --> 06:02:03.401
THEIR LIFE- BUT IT ALSO SAVE

06:02:03.468 --> 06:02:06.571
THEIR LIFE. AND OTHERS HAVE SAID

06:02:06.638 --> 06:02:08.640
THAT IT HAS BEEN SO TRAUMATIC

06:02:08.706 --> 06:02:10.809
THAT THAT THEY WOULD NEVER ALLOW

06:02:10.875 --> 06:02:12.510
THEMSELVES TO BE HOSPITALIZED

06:02:12.577 --> 06:02:14.012
UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS AGAIN AND

06:02:14.079 --> 06:02:16.047
SO CLEARLY WE NEED TO SPEND SOME

06:02:16.114 --> 06:02:18.283
TIME TALKING ABOUT QUALITY OF

06:02:18.349 --> 06:02:20.618
CARE AND WHAT THE COP WHAT THAT

06:02:20.685 --> 06:02:21.753
REMOTE RESPONSE LOOKS LIKE AND I

06:02:21.820 --> 06:02:23.655
THINK DOCTORS ELDER LAID OUT. A

06:02:23.721 --> 06:02:25.390
MODEL THAT THE COMMISSION

06:02:25.457 --> 06:02:27.092
TOMORROW IN FACT IS DOING A SITE

06:02:27.158 --> 06:02:28.526
VISIT FOR THE PROGRAM DOWN IN

VISIT. THE SITE HERE IN TOWN-

06:02:33.865 --> 06:02:35.233
PROBABLY THE VERY BEGINNING OF

06:02:35.300 --> 06:02:37.635
JANUARY. SO YOU KNOW I WOULD

06:02:37.702 --> 06:02:39.070
SUGGEST THAT YOU KNOW FIRST WE

06:02:39.137 --> 06:02:41.272
REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS

06:02:41.339 --> 06:02:42.774
THAT EXPERIENCE OF INVOLUNTARY

06:02:42.841 --> 06:02:44.442
CARE AND HOW CAN WE BEGIN TO

06:02:44.509 --> 06:02:46.344
UNDERSTAND FROM THAT FROM THAT

06:02:46.411 --> 06:02:48.880
HUMAN CENTERED PERSPECTIVE HOW

06:02:48.947 --> 06:02:50.915
WE CAN IMPROVE QUALITY. AND

06:02:50.982 --> 06:02:53.184
UNDERSTAND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE

06:02:53.251 --> 06:02:54.586
TO PUT STANDARDS AND STRATEGIES

06:02:54.652 --> 06:02:56.421
IN PLACE THAT NGUYEN INVOLUNTARY

06:02:56.488 --> 06:02:58.022
CARE IS PROVIDED IT IS THE MOST.

06:02:58.089 --> 06:03:00.091
EFFECTIVE OUTCOME FOCUSED CARE

06:03:00.158 --> 06:03:01.926
POSSIBLE WE DO THAT IN OTHER

06:03:01.993 --> 06:03:03.895
AREAS OF HEALTH CARE ROUTINELY.

06:03:03.962 --> 06:03:05.563
AND WE HAVE NOT SPENT AS MUCH

06:03:05.630 --> 06:03:07.198
TIME AND ATTENTION ON ENSURING

06:03:07.265 --> 06:03:08.833
THAT THAT'S A STRATEGY THAT WE

06:03:08.900 --> 06:03:10.835
CAN DEPLOY IN ADDRESSING THE

06:03:10.902 --> 06:03:12.637
NEED FOR INVOLUNTARY CARE. THE

06:03:12.704 --> 06:03:14.072
GOVERNOR IN HIS HISTORIC

06:03:14.139 --> 06:03:15.106
CHILDREN NEED BEHAVIOR HEALTH

06:03:15.173 --> 06:03:16.508
INITIATIVE HAD INCLUDE

06:03:16.574 --> 06:03:18.009
SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING TO EXPLORE

06:03:18.076 --> 06:03:19.110
AND SCALE EVIDENCE BASED

06:03:19.177 --> 06:03:20.478
PRACTICES I THINK THIS IS AN

06:03:20.545 --> 06:03:22.046
AREA WHERE. WE MIGHT WANT TO

06:03:22.113 --> 06:03:23.515
CONSIDER SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR

06:03:23.581 --> 06:03:25.049
TO UNDERSTAND ARE THERE EVIDENCE

06:03:25.116 --> 06:03:26.484
BASED PRACTICES AND HOW MIGHT

06:03:26.551 --> 06:03:28.553
THE STATE INCENTIVIZE. THE

06:03:28.620 --> 06:03:29.654
ADOPTION OF EFFECTIVE

06:03:29.721 --> 06:03:31.222
INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL ADDRESS

06:03:31.289 --> 06:03:32.891
THE ISSUE OF QUALITY AND

06:03:32.957 --> 06:03:34.526
OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH

06:03:34.592 --> 06:03:36.861
INVOLUNTARY CARE WHEN IT IS

06:03:36.928 --> 06:03:38.763
UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION. BUT AS

06:03:38.830 --> 06:03:41.366
AS OUTLINED. BY OTHERS- IT'S

06:03:41.432 --> 06:03:42.534
ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO LOOK

06:03:42.600 --> 06:03:45.036
AT. THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING

06:03:45.103 --> 06:03:47.272
RELIANCE ON INVOLUNTARY CARE IT

06:03:47.338 --> 06:03:48.573
NEEDS TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL

06:03:48.640 --> 06:03:49.874
INTERVENTION AS YOU'VE HEARD

06:03:49.941 --> 06:03:51.743
THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY. SO IN

06:03:51.809 --> 06:03:53.811
ADDITION TO REALLY ENGAGING

06:03:53.878 --> 06:03:55.747
PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE TO

06:03:55.813 --> 06:03:56.948
THINK ABOUT HOW WE COULD

06:03:57.015 --> 06:03:59.784
REDESIGN AND REINVENT HOW WE

06:03:59.851 --> 06:04:01.419
RESPOND WHEN PEOPLE ARE A DANGER

06:04:01.486 --> 06:04:03.087
TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. REALLY

06:04:03.154 --> 06:04:05.390
THINKING SYSTEMATICALLY ABOUT

06:04:05.456 --> 06:04:08.126
HOW CAN WE REDUCE THAT RELIANCE

06:04:08.193 --> 06:04:09.494
. CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY

06:04:09.561 --> 06:04:11.062
TO SET CLEAR GOALS COMPELLING

06:04:11.129 --> 06:04:12.864
GOALS FOR THE USE OF INVOLUNTARY

06:04:12.931 --> 06:04:15.099
CARE TO MAKE IT RARE BUT ALSO AT

06:04:15.166 --> 06:04:15.833
THE SAME TIME TO MAKE IT

06:04:15.900 --> 06:04:17.602
EXCLLENT I THINK YOU'VE HEARD

06:04:17.669 --> 06:04:18.970
FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND I HAVE

06:04:19.037 --> 06:04:21.139
FAMILY MEMBERS MYSELF. WHO WHO

06:04:21.206 --> 06:04:22.273
HAVE NEEDED THAT LEVEL OF

06:04:22.340 --> 06:04:23.942
INTERVENTION AND HAVE CALLED

06:04:24.008 --> 06:04:25.810
INTO QUESTION THE ADEQUACY AND

06:04:25.877 --> 06:04:26.978
THE QUALITY OF THAT CARE SO IT

06:04:27.045 --> 06:04:29.113
NEEDS TO BE EXCELLENT. AND IT

06:04:29.180 --> 06:04:30.648
NEEDS TO BE EXCEPTIONAL AND RARE

06:04:30.715 --> 06:04:32.984
IN THAT IN THAT INSTANCE. THIS

06:04:33.051 --> 06:04:36.020
MEANS- AGGRESSIVELY FOCUS ON HOW

06:04:36.087 --> 06:04:38.256
WE CAN RESPOND MUCH EARLIER. TO

06:04:38.323 --> 06:04:40.158
THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. WHO

06:04:40.225 --> 06:04:41.960
ARE AT POTENTIAL RISK FOR

06:04:42.026 --> 06:04:43.628
NEEDING INVOLUNTARY CARE. WE

06:04:43.695 --> 06:04:45.363
HAVE SOME UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES

06:04:45.430 --> 06:04:47.565
IN THE DESIGN OF OUR SYSTEM SO.

06:04:47.632 --> 06:04:49.100
THE AUDITOR IN HER PRESENTATION

06:04:49.167 --> 06:04:49.968
MENTION FULL SERVICE

06:04:50.034 --> 06:04:51.536
PARTNERSHIPS. THIS IS A

06:04:51.603 --> 06:04:53.538
CALIFORNIA INVENTION COMING OUT

06:04:53.605 --> 06:04:55.340
OF WORK DONE IN IN LONG BEACH.

06:04:55.406 --> 06:04:58.076
YEARS AGO AND THAT IDENTIFIED A-

06:04:58.142 --> 06:05:00.178
SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO WORKING

06:05:00.245 --> 06:05:01.446
WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL

06:05:01.512 --> 06:05:02.914
HEALTH NEEDS. TO SERVE THEM IN

06:05:02.981 --> 06:05:04.482
COMMUNITIES WHO OTHERWISE WOULD

06:05:04.549 --> 06:05:05.183
HAVE BEEN SERVED IN THE

06:05:05.250 --> 06:05:06.851
HOSPITAL'S. FULL SERVICE

06:05:06.918 --> 06:05:08.253
PARTNERSHIPS ARE DESIGNED TO

06:05:08.319 --> 06:05:09.587
REDUCE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

06:05:09.654 --> 06:05:10.922
INVOLVEMENT HOMELESSNESS AND

06:05:10.989 --> 06:05:12.857
HOSPITALIZATION. UNDER THE

06:05:12.924 --> 06:05:14.392
STATE'S FUNDING RULES WE REQUIRE

06:05:14.459 --> 06:05:16.261
COUNTIES TO SPEND JUST UNDER A

06:05:16.327 --> 06:05:17.795
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO

06:05:17.862 --> 06:05:18.363
SUPPORT FULL SERVICE

06:05:18.429 --> 06:05:20.131
PARTNERSHIPS. WE NEED TO MAKE

06:05:20.198 --> 06:05:21.266
SURE THAT THAT INVESTMENT IS

06:05:21.332 --> 06:05:22.400
HAVING THE IMPACT THAT IT IS

06:05:22.467 --> 06:05:24.702
SUPPOSED TO HAVE. AND THAT CAN

06:05:24.769 --> 06:05:26.838
BECOME AN INTERVENTION THAT CAN

06:05:26.904 --> 06:05:29.274
REDUCE. THE NEED FOR INVOLUNTARY

06:05:29.340 --> 06:05:31.309
SERVICES OVER TIME. I WANT TO

06:05:31.376 --> 06:05:32.944
RECOGNIZE. THAT THE WORK OF

06:05:33.011 --> 06:05:34.479
SENATOR EGGMAN WHO WAS HERE THIS

06:05:34.545 --> 06:05:36.214
MORNING SHE PASSED S. B. SHE

06:05:36.281 --> 06:05:39.384
AUTHORED SB. SIX FOUR SIX FIVE

06:05:39.450 --> 06:05:40.685
TO THE GOVERNOR SIGNED TO BEGIN

06:05:40.752 --> 06:05:42.053
THE PROCESS TO LOOKING MORE

06:05:42.120 --> 06:05:43.087
INTENSIVELY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

06:05:43.154 --> 06:05:44.255
THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP.

06:05:44.322 --> 06:05:46.457
PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE- THAT

06:05:46.524 --> 06:05:47.425
LEGISLATION REQUIRES THE

06:05:47.492 --> 06:05:48.893
COMMISSION TO ENGAGE TO LOOK AT

06:05:48.960 --> 06:05:50.728
THE DATA AND TO TRY TO SUPPORT

06:05:50.795 --> 06:05:51.296
THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT

06:05:51.362 --> 06:05:53.064
YOU'RE ASKING TODAY. THAT'S ONE

06:05:53.131 --> 06:05:54.966
TO RECOGNIZE DR JOHN SHARON L.

06:05:55.033 --> 06:05:56.067
A. COUNTY HE ACTUALLY STARTED

06:05:56.134 --> 06:05:57.735
THAT WORK. REALLY TRYING TO

06:05:57.802 --> 06:05:59.170
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT FULL

06:05:59.237 --> 06:06:00.004
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP FOR HAVING

06:06:00.071 --> 06:06:02.473
IN LA. AND WITH SOME COMMISSION

06:06:02.540 --> 06:06:03.541
SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

06:06:03.608 --> 06:06:05.376
ENGAGE EIGHT COUNTIES. TO

06:06:05.443 --> 06:06:06.878
REPLICATE THE KIND OF WORK THAT

06:06:06.944 --> 06:06:08.980
DR SHARON HAS DONE IN LA. TO TRY

06:06:09.047 --> 06:06:10.114
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN GET

06:06:10.181 --> 06:06:13.384
BIG BIGGER BANG FOR THE BUCK.

06:06:13.451 --> 06:06:14.218
FOR FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS.

06:06:14.285 --> 06:06:15.386
THE COMMISSION IS DOING A NUMBER

06:06:15.453 --> 06:06:16.621
OF OTHER THINGS WITH A SMALL

06:06:16.688 --> 06:06:17.789
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THE STATE

06:06:17.855 --> 06:06:19.057
HAS PROVIDED A FEW YEARS AGO

06:06:19.123 --> 06:06:21.793
INCLUDING. TRYING TO EXPAND THE

06:06:21.859 --> 06:06:23.027
UTILIZATION OF PSYCHIATRIC

06:06:23.094 --> 06:06:24.829
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES ADVANCE

06:06:24.896 --> 06:06:25.763
DIRECTIVES ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE

06:06:25.830 --> 06:06:27.632
HEALTHCARE FIELD. THEY'RE NOT

06:06:27.699 --> 06:06:29.400
REGULARLY USED IN THE AREA OF

06:06:29.467 --> 06:06:31.035
PSYCHIATRY AND SAW THOUGH

06:06:31.102 --> 06:06:32.337
THEY'RE AUTHORIZED OR LEGALLY

06:06:32.403 --> 06:06:34.238
RECOGNIZED WE DON'T HAVE.

06:06:34.305 --> 06:06:35.673
STANDARDS OF PRACTICE AND

06:06:35.740 --> 06:06:37.141
IMPLEMENTATION TO BETTER

06:06:37.208 --> 06:06:38.943
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN DEPLOY

06:06:39.010 --> 06:06:40.478
PSYCHIATRIC VENTS DIRECTIVES

06:06:40.545 --> 06:06:41.612
WERE WORKING WITH ABOUT EIGHT

06:06:41.679 --> 06:06:43.348
COUNTIES. TO DEPLOY THIS

06:06:43.414 --> 06:06:45.516
STRATEGY AS A AS AN INNOVATION

06:06:45.583 --> 06:06:47.085
TO SEE IF THIS APPROACH ACTUALLY

06:06:47.151 --> 06:06:48.753
COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR

06:06:48.820 --> 06:06:50.588
INVOLUNTARY CARE. AND THE IDEA

06:06:50.655 --> 06:06:51.823
REALLY IS TO WORK WITH SOMEONE

06:06:51.889 --> 06:06:53.725
WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN CRISIS. TO

06:06:53.791 --> 06:06:55.560
DESTRESS AND ENGAGE SO THAT WHEN

06:06:55.626 --> 06:06:56.994
THEY ARE IN CRISIS WE HAVE A

06:06:57.061 --> 06:06:58.529
GAME PLAN THAT THEY THEMSELVES

06:06:58.596 --> 06:06:59.997
HAVE DEVELOPED. SO IT'S LESS

06:07:00.064 --> 06:07:01.866
ABOUT IMPOSING A MEDICAL

06:07:01.933 --> 06:07:03.267
INTERVENTION AGAINST SOMEONE'S

06:07:03.334 --> 06:07:05.536
WILL AT A TIME OF CRISIS INSTEAD

06:07:05.603 --> 06:07:06.871
WORKING WITH THEM WHEN THEY

06:07:06.938 --> 06:07:08.306
DON'T NEED THAT INTERVENTION TO

06:07:08.373 --> 06:07:10.174
UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL WORK BEST.

06:07:10.241 --> 06:07:11.776
SIMILAR TO THE KIND OF LANGUAGE

06:07:11.843 --> 06:07:13.478
YOU SAW IN THE PRESENTATION FROM

06:07:13.544 --> 06:07:16.614
DOCTORS DOLLAR ABOUT ENGAGING

06:07:16.681 --> 06:07:17.215
FROM THIS VERY HUMAN CENTERED

06:07:17.281 --> 06:07:20.151
APPROACH. ANOTHER AREA WORTH

06:07:20.218 --> 06:07:22.053
CONSIDERING IS TO RECOGNIZE.

06:07:22.120 --> 06:07:23.187
THAT ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THE

06:07:23.254 --> 06:07:24.822
DATA OF THE INSTANCES IN WHICH

06:07:24.889 --> 06:07:26.924
PEOPLE ARE BEING PUT INTO

06:07:26.991 --> 06:07:28.993
INVOLUNTARY. TREATMENT TO

06:07:29.060 --> 06:07:30.795
RECOGNIZE THAT WE ANTICIPATE

06:07:30.862 --> 06:07:31.529
THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL OF

06:07:31.596 --> 06:07:34.132
PSYCHOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH. THESE

06:07:34.198 --> 06:07:36.467
CONSUMERS WHO ARE FIFTY ONE

06:07:36.534 --> 06:07:37.802
FIFTY EIGHT. THE STATE HAS MADE

06:07:37.869 --> 06:07:39.203
SOME INVESTMENTS IN EARLY

06:07:39.270 --> 06:07:41.172
PSYCHOSIS CARE BUT WE DO NOT YET

06:07:41.239 --> 06:07:42.140
HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE IN

06:07:42.206 --> 06:07:43.508
CALIFORNIA WHERE EVERY

06:07:43.574 --> 06:07:45.510
CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO. AN

06:07:45.576 --> 06:07:47.412
EVIDENCE BASED EARLY RESPONSE TO

06:07:47.478 --> 06:07:49.580
PSYCHOSIS. RESEARCH OUT OF THE

06:07:49.647 --> 06:07:50.848
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUGGEST THAT

06:07:50.915 --> 06:07:52.016
EARLYINTERVENTIONS CAN HAVE

06:07:52.083 --> 06:07:54.118
PROFOUND IMPACTS. TO ALLOW

06:07:54.185 --> 06:07:56.154
PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH INDEPENDENT

06:07:56.220 --> 06:07:57.889
RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTIVE LIVES. IN

06:07:57.955 --> 06:07:59.390
REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON CRISIS

06:07:59.457 --> 06:08:01.692
CARE OVER TIME. BUT IT IS THE

06:08:01.759 --> 06:08:03.828
EXCEPTION IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE

06:08:03.895 --> 06:08:05.329
WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTY

06:08:05.396 --> 06:08:07.231
PARTNERS TO REALLY EXPAND THAT.

06:08:07.298 --> 06:08:09.033
I MENTIONED THE SECOND TWO

06:08:09.100 --> 06:08:10.568
EVENTS DIRECTIVES WORKED EARLY

06:08:10.635 --> 06:08:13.104
PSYCHOSIS WORK- THE CONVERSATION

06:08:13.171 --> 06:08:14.672
THAT WE'RE HAVING ON EMPATHIC.

06:08:14.739 --> 06:08:17.375
IS WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WAYS

06:08:17.442 --> 06:08:18.910
THAT WE CAN BUILD UPON THE

06:08:18.976 --> 06:08:20.912
CAPACITY OF OUR COUTY PARTNERS.

06:08:20.978 --> 06:08:21.879
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR

06:08:21.946 --> 06:08:23.881
NEEDS ARE ENGAGE THE VOICE OF

06:08:23.948 --> 06:08:25.149
CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS

06:08:25.216 --> 06:08:26.617
IDENTIFY MODELS THAT HAVE BEEN

06:08:26.684 --> 06:08:28.152
ADOPTED IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND

06:08:28.219 --> 06:08:29.620
OTHER STATES OR EVEN HERE IN

06:08:29.687 --> 06:08:30.755
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OFTEN THE

06:08:30.822 --> 06:08:32.557
CASE. AND BEGIN TO SCALE THE

06:08:32.623 --> 06:08:34.325
STRATEGIES IN WAYS THEY CAN

06:08:34.392 --> 06:08:35.893
SUPPORT THEIR EFFECTIVE

06:08:35.960 --> 06:08:37.895
IMPLEMENTATION STATEWIDE. I

06:08:37.962 --> 06:08:40.531
THINK- WE KNOW THAT THAT WE'VE

06:08:40.598 --> 06:08:41.566
BEEN ABLE TO TAP INTO THE

06:08:41.632 --> 06:08:43.768
EXPERTISE OF UC DAVIS UCSF

06:08:43.835 --> 06:08:45.837
STANFORD USC. OTHER ACADEMIC

06:08:45.903 --> 06:08:48.206
PARTNERS- ALL OF THIS REALLY

06:08:48.272 --> 06:08:49.707
STARTS WITH LISTENING TO THE

06:08:49.774 --> 06:08:50.875
CUSTOMER THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

06:08:50.942 --> 06:08:53.444
SERVE. CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY

06:08:53.511 --> 06:08:55.613
ACTIVE. AND EMPOWERED PEER

06:08:55.680 --> 06:08:59.183
MOVEMENT. AND CLEARLY AVAILABLE

06:08:59.250 --> 06:09:00.384
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE

06:09:00.451 --> 06:09:01.552
LOOKING FOR WHAT WORKS AND WHAT

06:09:01.619 --> 06:09:03.421
DOESN'T WORK WE HAVE A VERY

06:09:03.488 --> 06:09:04.422
EMPOWERED IN VOCAL FAMILY

06:09:04.489 --> 06:09:06.257
MOVEMENT. VERY IMPORTANT TO

06:09:06.324 --> 06:09:08.025
REALLY ENGAGE BOTH PEERS AND

06:09:08.092 --> 06:09:09.660
FAMILY MEMBERS TO STEP BACK A

06:09:09.727 --> 06:09:10.428
LITTLE BIT AND SAY WHAT WE

06:09:10.495 --> 06:09:11.963
TRYING TO GET DONE. AND THEN TO

06:09:12.029 --> 06:09:14.298
TRY TO DESIGN THESE SYSTEMS SO

06:09:14.365 --> 06:09:17.335
THAT ONCE WE IDENTIFY I'M A BEST

06:09:17.401 --> 06:09:17.969
PRACTICE IN A MODEL WE YOU CAN

06:09:18.035 --> 06:09:19.770
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A SCALE THEM.

06:09:19.837 --> 06:09:21.706
IN A IN A RELATIVELY EASY WAY

06:09:21.772 --> 06:09:23.441
PART OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE.

06:09:23.508 --> 06:09:25.943
IS WE CAN DEVELOP EVIDENCE BASED

06:09:26.010 --> 06:09:27.478
OR EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS BUT

06:09:27.545 --> 06:09:29.247
SCALING THEM IS OFTEN VERY VERY

06:09:29.313 --> 06:09:30.515
DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE WAY

06:09:30.581 --> 06:09:32.049
THAT WE DESIGNED OUR SYSTEM IN

06:09:32.116 --> 06:09:34.218
CALIFORNIA. SO I WOULD I WOULD

06:09:34.285 --> 06:09:36.387
SAY- AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THE

06:09:36.454 --> 06:09:38.222
FOCUS REALLY SHOULD BE ON

06:09:38.289 --> 06:09:40.925
EXCELLENCE IN THE RESPONSE WHEN

06:09:40.992 --> 06:09:42.460
A FIFTY ONE FIFTY IS NEEDED. AND

06:09:42.527 --> 06:09:44.495
FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

06:09:44.562 --> 06:09:45.930
BUT REALLY INVESTING IN

06:09:45.997 --> 06:09:47.798
STRATEGIES TO PREVENT THE NEED

06:09:47.865 --> 06:09:50.201
TO USE THAT TOOL- SO IT IS IT IS

06:09:50.268 --> 06:09:52.169
AN EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE. AND

06:09:52.236 --> 06:09:54.005
THAT MEANS AS YOU DISCUSSED

06:09:54.071 --> 06:09:55.706
BUILDING OUT THE DATA SYSTEMS

06:09:55.773 --> 06:09:57.308
BUILDING UP THE CAPACITY FOR THE

06:09:57.375 --> 06:09:58.843
STATE TO BERESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

06:09:58.910 --> 06:10:01.178
OPPORTUNITY AND TO BE ABLE TO

06:10:01.245 --> 06:10:01.746
DRIVE TOWARDS THAT GOAL OVER

06:10:01.812 --> 06:10:03.381
TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE

06:10:03.447 --> 06:10:04.782
TO BE HERE TODAY HAPPY TO ANSWER

06:10:04.849 --> 06:10:05.850
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

06:10:05.917 --> 06:10:07.585
GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

06:10:07.652 --> 06:10:09.921
EWING- MOVE TO OUR- OUR PANEL

06:10:09.987 --> 06:10:12.123
HERE ARE. MY COLLEAGUES- MISTER

06:10:12.189 --> 06:10:16.427
KALRA. THANK YOU MR. I HAVE A-

06:10:16.494 --> 06:10:19.230
THIS IS COME UP AND NATURALLY-

06:10:19.297 --> 06:10:20.665
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION SO FAR

06:10:20.731 --> 06:10:22.266
IT IS A BUT NOT TO COMING IN AND

06:10:22.333 --> 06:10:26.437
OUT BUT- IN TERMS OF- URGENCY

06:10:26.504 --> 06:10:28.005
THAT IF SOMEONE'S IN CRISIS AND

06:10:28.072 --> 06:10:31.409
ALL CRISIS. THE URGENCY OF-

06:10:31.475 --> 06:10:32.843
DEALING WITH IT RIGHT AWAY.

06:10:32.910 --> 06:10:35.146
CERTAINLY OTHERWISE IT ACTUALLY

06:10:35.212 --> 06:10:37.715
WILL EXACERBATE- IF UNTREATED IN

06:10:37.782 --> 06:10:41.686
AND BECOME. A FARM WORSE FOR

06:10:41.752 --> 06:10:42.253
THEM AS AN INDIVIDUAL FARMER

06:10:42.320 --> 06:10:44.922
COSTLY AS ON- THEN OVER THE LAST

06:10:44.989 --> 06:10:46.591
COUPLE YEARS ON A COUPLE

06:10:46.657 --> 06:10:47.625
OCCASIONS I'VE I WENT TO THE

06:10:47.692 --> 06:10:50.461
LOCAL. COMMUNITY CLINICS THAT-

06:10:50.528 --> 06:10:54.432
OFFER MEDICAL SERVICES. AND

06:10:54.498 --> 06:10:56.834
THEY'VE INDICATED THAT- IF

06:10:56.901 --> 06:10:59.170
SOMEONE IS GOING TO THE CLINIC

06:10:59.236 --> 06:11:00.905
FOR. SOME KIND OF PHYSICAL

06:11:00.972 --> 06:11:03.040
ELEMENT OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU THAT

06:11:03.107 --> 06:11:05.109
THEY CANNOT. IMMEDIATELY BE

06:11:05.176 --> 06:11:06.477
REFERRED FOR MENTAL HEALTH

06:11:06.544 --> 06:11:08.379
TREATMENT AT THE SAME TIME AND

06:11:08.446 --> 06:11:09.814
GET THAT MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT

06:11:09.880 --> 06:11:15.620
IS- BUT I IMAGINE A KNOWN. ISSUE

06:11:15.686 --> 06:11:16.220
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME

06:11:16.287 --> 06:11:16.821
TIME CORRECT. YEAH AND I JUST

06:11:16.887 --> 06:11:17.788
WANT THAT UP TO NOT SOMETHING

06:11:17.855 --> 06:11:20.391
THAT. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US

06:11:20.458 --> 06:11:21.959
HAVE HEARD. OF IT GOING TO OUR

06:11:22.026 --> 06:11:22.693
LOCAL CLINICS THAT THEY HAVE

06:11:22.760 --> 06:11:25.262
TODAY AND INSTEAD SEND THEM AWAY

06:11:25.329 --> 06:11:27.031
SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FORTY

06:11:27.098 --> 06:11:27.832
EIGHT HOURS SEVENTY TWO HOURS

06:11:27.898 --> 06:11:29.600
WHO KNOWS WHEN. AT SOME LATER

06:11:29.667 --> 06:11:30.701
DATE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A

06:11:30.768 --> 06:11:31.369
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL RIGHT

06:11:31.435 --> 06:11:33.871
DOWN THE HALL. AND SO I JUST MAY

06:11:33.938 --> 06:11:35.706
MAKE AS A COMIC ENERGY

06:11:35.773 --> 06:11:37.975
REITERATING THE NEED IN ALL

06:11:38.042 --> 06:11:39.810
SETTINGS TO HAVE THAT URGENCY OF

06:11:39.877 --> 06:11:42.279
CARE ESPECIALLY IF THE RESOURCES

06:11:42.346 --> 06:11:43.080
RIGHT THERE AND IF IT'S A MATTER

06:11:43.147 --> 06:11:45.416
OF. CALLED THINGS ARE PAID OR

06:11:45.483 --> 06:11:46.817
REIMBURSED ON HAVE YOU THOSE ARE

06:11:46.884 --> 06:11:48.919
THINGS THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY

06:11:48.986 --> 06:11:49.954
MORE CONFIDENCE LEVEL BUT I

06:11:50.021 --> 06:11:54.358
APPRECIATE- AB THE PRESENTATION

06:11:54.425 --> 06:11:55.826
IN TERMS OF MAKING IT VERY CLEAR

06:11:55.893 --> 06:11:57.628
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS

06:11:57.695 --> 06:12:01.132
GETTING TREATMENT. ALL RIGHT

06:12:01.198 --> 06:12:04.135
AWAY YOU POSSIBLE. IF I MISTER.

06:12:04.201 --> 06:12:06.837
A SO PART OF THAT ISSUE IS

06:12:06.904 --> 06:12:08.305
AROUND FEDERAL RULES ABOUT

06:12:08.372 --> 06:12:10.474
REIMBURSEMENT RIGHT THAT PART OF

06:12:10.541 --> 06:12:12.910
THAT ISSUE IS THAT OUR SYSTEM

06:12:12.977 --> 06:12:13.511
REALLY ISN'T AN ON DEMAND KIND

06:12:13.577 --> 06:12:16.480
OF SYSTEM. RIGHT IF I WALK INTO

06:12:16.547 --> 06:12:17.982
IF I TRY TO SEE MY PRIMARY CARE

06:12:18.049 --> 06:12:19.784
PROVIDER AND I HAVE A SORE KNEE

06:12:19.850 --> 06:12:20.818
AND THE GOAL IS THAT AN

06:12:20.885 --> 06:12:23.320
ANTIBIOTIC OR- PAIN MEDICATION

06:12:23.387 --> 06:12:23.954
THAT'S USUALLY AVAILABLE BEFORE

06:12:24.021 --> 06:12:26.457
THE AFTERNOON. IF THE ANSWER IS

06:12:26.524 --> 06:12:29.293
SOMETHING- THAT INVOLVES MENTAL

06:12:29.360 --> 06:12:30.394
HEALTH INVOLVEMENT IT'S A

06:12:30.461 --> 06:12:31.862
DIFFERENT PAYMENT SYSTEM IT'S A

06:12:31.929 --> 06:12:32.797
DIFFERENT STRATEGY CAN TAKE

06:12:32.863 --> 06:12:35.599
MONTHS. SO I THINK THE ISSUE OF

06:12:35.666 --> 06:12:37.201
TWO VISITS DURING A SINGLE DAY

06:12:37.268 --> 06:12:39.136
IS ONE ISSUE BUT IT'S MUCH MORE

06:12:39.203 --> 06:12:41.572
BROADER THAN THAT. AND PART OF

06:12:41.639 --> 06:12:42.640
IT IS THAT WE DESIGNED THE

06:12:42.707 --> 06:12:45.176
SYSTEM. OFTEN OFTEN TO SORT OF

06:12:45.242 --> 06:12:47.211
EXCLUDE CERTAIN PEOPLE BASED ON

06:12:47.278 --> 06:12:49.513
WHO PAYS WHO'S YOUR INSURANCE-

06:12:49.580 --> 06:12:51.148
THIS THE STATE HAS INVESTED SOME

06:12:51.215 --> 06:12:52.183
FUNDING IN A USED DROP IN

06:12:52.249 --> 06:12:53.984
CENTER. THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE

06:12:54.051 --> 06:12:55.886
ALL COMERS. THAT STARTS WITH ITS

06:12:55.953 --> 06:12:57.588
ITS TARGETING YOUNG PEOPLE THAT

06:12:57.655 --> 06:12:58.923
THEY CAN WALK IN WITHOUT AN

06:12:58.989 --> 06:13:00.591
APPOINTMENT TO BE SEEN SAME DAY.

06:13:00.658 --> 06:13:01.792
AND THE LESSON THERE THE

06:13:01.859 --> 06:13:02.693
RESEARCH IN ITS ITS

06:13:02.760 --> 06:13:04.462
INTERNATIONAL IS THAT IF YOU

06:13:04.528 --> 06:13:06.130
WANT PEOPLE TO ACCESS CARE. YOU

06:13:06.197 --> 06:13:07.131
NEED O REMOVE AS MANY BARRIERS

06:13:07.198 --> 06:13:09.400
AS POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY PEOPLE

06:13:09.467 --> 06:13:11.602
WHO. ARE FACING DISABILITIES OR

06:13:11.669 --> 06:13:13.304
CHALLENGES ARE WHO ARE STRIVING.

06:13:13.370 --> 06:13:14.138
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO

06:13:14.205 --> 06:13:15.072
TAKE OVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO

06:13:15.139 --> 06:13:16.674
PUSH MORE PEOPLE INTO UPSTREAM

06:13:16.741 --> 06:13:18.542
KINDA SERVICES. TO AVOID THE

06:13:18.609 --> 06:13:21.579
NEED. FOR THAT YOU KNOW CRISIS

06:13:21.645 --> 06:13:23.647
RESPONSE. THANK YOU SEE THAT

06:13:23.714 --> 06:13:25.382
WITH THE VA FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S

06:13:25.449 --> 06:13:27.451
A NEWER FACILITY THAT WAS- THAT

06:13:27.518 --> 06:13:29.053
OPENED UP IN IN MY AREA WHERE

06:13:29.120 --> 06:13:30.855
IT'S A ONE STOP SHOP. FOR THEY

06:13:30.921 --> 06:13:31.856
HAVE WHATEVER YOUR NEEDS OVER

06:13:31.922 --> 06:13:33.257
THERE HOUSING PHYSICAL HEALTH

06:13:33.324 --> 06:13:35.559
MENTAL HEALTH. YOU NAME IT THEY

06:13:35.626 --> 06:13:37.394
THEY DON'T. YOU'RE NOT ASKING.

06:13:37.461 --> 06:13:39.130
OF THE PERSON IN NEED TO GO

06:13:39.196 --> 06:13:40.030
THROUGH ALL THE HOOPS AND TO

06:13:40.097 --> 06:13:41.465
TRAVEL AROUND AND WAIT FOR A

06:13:41.532 --> 06:13:43.300
DAILY FOR FIVE DAYS AND- I THINK

06:13:43.367 --> 06:13:44.802
THIS ALSO SPEAKS TO THIS IS ALSO

06:13:44.869 --> 06:13:46.604
BEEN REITERATED BY. BY MANY

06:13:46.670 --> 06:13:47.838

MINE. THAT WE JUST TREATMENT

06:13:49.807 --> 06:13:51.976
HELP DIFFERENTLY- AND I FIGURED

06:13:52.042 --> 06:13:53.611
THAT THAT CREATES A- A TOTALLY

06:13:53.677 --> 06:13:57.214
DIFFERENT. SYSTEM MIND IF THERE

06:13:57.281 --> 06:13:58.082
WAS A COORDINATION AND A SENSE

06:13:58.149 --> 06:14:01.485
THAT- OF TREATING THEM. AS AS

06:14:01.552 --> 06:14:03.220
EQUAL ELEMENTS- AND PHYSICAL

06:14:03.287 --> 06:14:04.889
AILMENT VERSES A MENTAL HEALTH

06:14:04.955 --> 06:14:07.124

06:14:09.059 --> 06:14:10.461
COORDINATION MORE EASILY TOO

BECAUSE YOU JUST. REMOVE SOME OF

06:14:11.862 --> 06:14:14.565

BARRIERS BUT ALSO JUST THE

06:14:15.766 --> 06:14:17.368
MENTALITY OF IT AND THE THOUGHT

06:17:22.252 --> 06:17:24.621
ARE SOME THAT HAVE GOTTEN. SB

06:17:24.688 --> 06:17:26.957
EIGHTY TWO FUNDS- THE- THE ONE

06:17:27.024 --> 06:17:28.258
THAT'S IN CARMICHAEL HERE IN

06:17:28.325 --> 06:17:30.094
SACRAMENTO COUNTY WAS ABLE TO.

06:17:30.160 --> 06:17:31.996
ACCESS SOME OF THAT. BUT EVEN

06:17:32.062 --> 06:17:34.331
ALSO SOME HAVE BEEN. DOING IT

06:17:34.398 --> 06:17:36.133
THROUGH PHILANTHROPY THERE'S AN

06:17:36.200 --> 06:17:37.601
ENORMOUS INTEREST IN THE FLAT

06:17:37.668 --> 06:17:39.536
FOR. PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY IN

06:17:39.603 --> 06:17:40.371
SUPPORTING THESE BECAUSE

06:17:40.437 --> 06:17:42.006
THERE'S- EVERYBODY KNOWS THERE'S

06:17:42.072 --> 06:17:42.806
A NATION WIDE MENTAL HEALTH

06:17:42.873 --> 06:17:44.875
CRISIS GOINGON. IT'S A REALLY

06:17:44.942 --> 06:17:47.077
GOOD INVESTMENT WHERE MAYBE NOT

06:17:47.144 --> 06:17:48.746
AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT. HAVE TO

06:17:48.812 --> 06:17:50.147
DONATE TO GET YOUR NAME ON

06:17:50.214 --> 06:17:52.416
SOMETHING. ELSE WHERE YOU CAN

06:17:52.483 --> 06:17:54.985
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE- AND AS

06:17:55.052 --> 06:17:56.453
I SAID YOU IS SOMETIMES THESE

06:17:56.520 --> 06:17:58.322
HOSPITALS HAVE UNDER UTILIZED.

06:17:58.389 --> 06:17:59.957
LARGE EMPTY ROOM THAT THEY CAN

06:18:00.024 --> 06:18:02.393
JUST. FIX UP AND MAKE INTO AN

06:18:02.459 --> 06:18:03.660
IMPACT UNIT THAT'S DOWN THE HALL

06:18:03.727 --> 06:18:05.529
FROM. FROM THEIR ER AND

06:18:05.596 --> 06:18:08.132
SUDDENLY. YOU KNOW. A FEW

06:18:08.198 --> 06:18:08.732
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS LATER

06:18:08.799 --> 06:18:09.266
YOU'VE GOT THIS WONDERFUL

06:18:09.333 --> 06:18:10.834
PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF THE

06:18:10.901 --> 06:18:12.870
REIMBURSEMENT- THERE'S A

06:18:12.936 --> 06:18:14.671
DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT THAT

06:18:14.738 --> 06:18:16.640
MEDICARE AND PRIVATE INSURANCE

06:18:16.707 --> 06:18:18.809
WILL ACTUALLY. REIMBURSE THIS

06:18:18.876 --> 06:18:21.211
UNDER A RUBRIC OF. EMERGENCY

06:18:21.278 --> 06:18:23.080
OBSERVATION CARE WHICH WOULD BE

06:18:23.147 --> 06:18:24.281
THE SAME THING AS IF YOU WERE IN

06:18:24.348 --> 06:18:25.949
THERE FOR. A SMALL BALL OF

06:18:26.016 --> 06:18:29.286
STRUCTURE IN OR UNDER CHILUBA

06:18:29.353 --> 06:18:30.454
TREE FOR A HEART ATTACK. THEY IT

06:18:30.521 --> 06:18:31.722
WILL REIMBURSE AND THAT BOTH

06:18:31.789 --> 06:18:33.524
UNDER PRIVATE INSURANCE AND

06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:35.592
MEDICARE AND MANY OTHER STATES

06:18:35.659 --> 06:18:36.560
MEDICAID WILL PAY FOR IT THAT

06:18:36.627 --> 06:18:38.762
WAY. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT

06:18:38.829 --> 06:18:40.564
RECOGNIZE OBSERVATION CARE UNDER

06:18:40.631 --> 06:18:44.501
MEDICAID. SO INSTEAD THE COUNTY-

06:18:44.568 --> 06:18:45.903
MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT THEN

06:18:45.969 --> 06:18:48.105
HAS TO REIMBURSE UNDER CRISIS

06:18:48.172 --> 06:18:50.474
STABILIZATION. FUNDING WHICH

06:18:50.541 --> 06:18:52.843
USUALLY IS USED- THOUGHT OF IS

06:18:52.910 --> 06:18:54.645
FOR COMMUNITY BASED. CRISIS

06:18:54.711 --> 06:18:56.747
STABILIZATION PROGRAMS. IT'S THE

06:18:56.814 --> 06:18:59.917
SAME REIMBURSEMENT STRATEGY-

06:18:59.983 --> 06:19:01.585
THAT'S USE THAN FOR THE MEDIC

06:19:01.652 --> 06:19:03.921
HAL IN THE HOSPITAL- IMPACT

06:19:03.987 --> 06:19:06.523
UNITS- BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

06:19:06.590 --> 06:19:08.025
APPROVED BY THE COUNTY MENTAL

06:19:08.092 --> 06:19:09.460
HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THEY NEED TO

06:19:09.526 --> 06:19:11.762
BE A CONTRACT AND THEN THEY WILL

06:19:11.829 --> 06:19:14.198
ONLY REIMBURSE FOR THE- MENTAL

06:19:14.264 --> 06:19:16.333
HEALTH- PATIENTS WHO HAVE

06:19:16.400 --> 06:19:18.368
MEDICAID MEDIC CAL FOR THAT

06:19:18.435 --> 06:19:20.137
SPECIFIC COUNTY. THEY WOULD HAVE

06:19:20.204 --> 06:19:22.039
TO GET ONE WITH ALL OTHER FIFTY

06:19:22.106 --> 06:19:22.806
SEVEN COUNTIES AS WELL IF

06:19:22.873 --> 06:19:23.674
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE FROM

06:19:23.740 --> 06:19:25.542
OTHER COUNTIES. SO DOES MAKE IT

06:19:25.609 --> 06:19:27.211
DIFFICULT AND IT ALSO PUTS THEM

06:19:27.277 --> 06:19:29.680
KIND OF AT. THE MERCY OF EACH

06:19:29.746 --> 06:19:31.281
COUNTY- IF THEY'RE GOING TO

06:19:31.348 --> 06:19:32.749
PROVIDE THIS SERVICE AS OPPOSED

06:19:32.816 --> 06:19:35.285
TO. ANY OTHER SERVICE THAT THAT

06:19:35.352 --> 06:19:37.321
HOSPITAL ER IS PROVIDING. THEY

06:19:37.387 --> 06:19:40.724
DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE COUNTY

06:19:40.791 --> 06:19:43.393
TO GET AN OK TO DO SO I GUESS

06:19:43.460 --> 06:19:45.863
SOME. OF I'M SITTING HERE

06:19:45.929 --> 06:19:48.665
THINKING- THIS. SO MANY

06:19:48.732 --> 06:19:51.869
ENTITIES- REIMBURSEMENT AS A FOR

06:19:51.935 --> 06:19:53.303
SERVICES AS A BIG COMPONENT

06:19:53.370 --> 06:19:55.139
OBVIOUSLY OF PROVIDING SERVICES

06:19:55.205 --> 06:19:58.442
FOR PEOPLE SO I JUST I HOPE THAT

06:19:58.509 --> 06:19:59.443
WE'RE NOT GOING WE'RE NOT GOING

06:19:59.510 --> 06:20:02.146
TO SEE THE EVOLUTION OF M.

06:20:02.212 --> 06:20:03.347
PASSED SLOW DOWN BY THE

06:20:03.413 --> 06:20:05.516
POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE CAN BE

06:20:05.582 --> 06:20:07.251
DIFFICULT TO GET REIMBURSED SO-

06:20:07.317 --> 06:20:10.220
THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

06:20:10.287 --> 06:20:10.888
SOMETHING IS SHOWING GREAT

06:20:10.954 --> 06:20:13.323
PROMISE. WEST DOLLARS BUT MOST

06:20:13.390 --> 06:20:15.292
IMPORTANTLY A MUCH BETTER

06:20:15.359 --> 06:20:17.427
IMPACT. AND OUTCOME FOR THE

06:20:17.494 --> 06:20:20.164
PATIENT NOW. OUR SYSTEM START

06:20:20.230 --> 06:20:21.798
ARE ARE ALWAYS SET UP TO

06:20:21.865 --> 06:20:24.334
ACCOMMODATE FOR THOSE KINDS OF

06:20:24.401 --> 06:20:26.603
THINGS TO SAY. DANGER ROGERS YOU

06:20:26.670 --> 06:20:27.638
KNOW SO I THINK WHAT THE HECK

06:20:27.704 --> 06:20:29.173
YOU KNOW. YOU WERE GOING TO PAY

06:20:29.239 --> 06:20:30.274
LESS AND WE'RE GOING TO GET A

06:20:30.340 --> 06:20:31.975
BETTER OUTCOME- I DON'T KNOW

06:20:32.042 --> 06:20:35.112
ABOUT THAT. SO SO I I'M NOT AN

06:20:35.179 --> 06:20:37.147
EXPERT ON THIS- AND I AND I

06:20:37.214 --> 06:20:38.415
DON'T EVER WANT TO BE AN EXPERT

06:20:38.482 --> 06:20:40.450
ON THIS BUT THIS IS FEELS LIKE.

06:20:40.517 --> 06:20:44.421
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR- A WAIVER- IN

06:20:44.488 --> 06:20:45.956
INNOVATION WAIVER SOMETHING WITH

06:20:46.023 --> 06:20:47.758
THE FEDS TO BE ABLE TO DRAW DOWN

06:20:47.824 --> 06:20:49.560
RESOURCES TO EXPAND UPON THIS

06:20:49.626 --> 06:20:51.828
KIND OF A PROGRAM THINKING IN

06:20:51.895 --> 06:20:53.997
CALIFORNIA- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

06:20:54.064 --> 06:20:57.734
HAVE SAID THAT BUT- BUT- I DID-

06:20:57.801 --> 06:20:59.836
BUT- YOU KNOW. THIS ISN'T JUST

06:20:59.903 --> 06:21:01.205
HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA THESE

06:21:01.271 --> 06:21:02.506
IMPACT UNITS YOU SHOW TO OTHERS

06:21:02.573 --> 06:21:04.374
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

06:21:04.441 --> 06:21:05.008
THAT THAT OR MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

06:21:05.075 --> 06:21:07.277
IN CLEARLY. WHAT'S GOING ON IN

06:21:07.344 --> 06:21:10.414
HOSPITAL ER'S ISN'T. IS IT WE'RE

06:21:10.480 --> 06:21:11.882
DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND

06:21:11.949 --> 06:21:12.749
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NOT

06:21:12.816 --> 06:21:14.718
GETTING THE DESIRED RESULTS SO.

06:21:14.785 --> 06:21:15.586
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR

06:21:15.652 --> 06:21:17.221
PRESENTATION- I'M HOW DID YOU

06:21:17.287 --> 06:21:18.822
WANT TO A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. I

06:21:18.889 --> 06:21:27.064
JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON THE. IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ONLY OR

06:21:27.130 --> 06:21:29.233
ARE THERE STATES. THAT DO PAY

06:21:29.299 --> 06:21:30.767
FOR OBSERVATION YEAH SO

06:21:30.834 --> 06:21:32.402
OBSERVATION IS AGNOSTIC TO

06:21:32.469 --> 06:21:33.937
DIAGNOSIS AS I SAID IT'S WHETHER

06:21:34.004 --> 06:21:36.240
IT'S MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC IT'S

06:21:36.306 --> 06:21:37.674
ALL OF RUMORED AND SHE CARE.

06:21:37.741 --> 06:21:39.309
THINK THEY'RE SOMETHING LIKE

06:21:39.376 --> 06:21:40.010
THIRTY FIVE STATES WHICH

06:21:40.077 --> 06:21:41.645
MEDICAID PAYS OBSERVATION

06:21:41.712 --> 06:21:43.247
EMERGENCY CARE BUT CALIFORNIA

06:21:43.313 --> 06:21:46.383
DOES NOT. THAT'S SOMETHING I'D

06:21:46.450 --> 06:21:48.518
LIKE TO FOLLOW UP AND SEE IF WE

06:21:48.585 --> 06:21:50.520
CAN MAKE A FISCAL ARGUMENT FOR

06:21:50.587 --> 06:21:52.089
WHY IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR

06:21:52.155 --> 06:21:54.191
CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THAT TYPE OF

06:21:54.258 --> 06:21:56.026
INVESTMENT AND WOULD LOVE

CASE LAW- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE

06:22:08.739 --> 06:22:10.140
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

06:22:10.207 --> 06:22:12.242
CHANGE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW IN A

06:22:12.309 --> 06:22:12.776
WAY THAT WILL IMPROVE THE

06:22:12.843 --> 06:22:14.645
LIKELIHOOD A PERSON. WILL BE

06:22:14.711 --> 06:22:16.079
BETTER ABLE TO RECEIVE THE

06:22:16.146 --> 06:22:18.048
MENTAL OR- PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE

06:22:18.115 --> 06:22:20.183
THEY NEED WITHOUT. LIMITING

06:22:20.250 --> 06:22:21.251
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND

06:22:21.318 --> 06:22:23.220
IF SO HOW WOULD WE ACCOMPLISH

06:22:23.287 --> 06:22:30.460
THAT. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU- WHAT

06:22:30.527 --> 06:22:31.962
I DO WANT TO SAY I WANT TO PICK

06:22:32.029 --> 06:22:33.463
UP ON SOMETHING THAT THE DOCTOR

YOU IN TESTIFIED BACK AS WE

06:22:35.132 --> 06:22:36.800
ACTUALLY HAD SOME EXPERIENCE

06:22:36.867 --> 06:22:37.801
WITH THIS IN OUR DISABILITY

06:22:37.868 --> 06:22:39.403
RIGHTS CLINIC HERE IN WASHINGTON

06:22:39.469 --> 06:22:41.838
AND THAT IS. THE USE OF ADVANCED

06:22:41.905 --> 06:22:44.107
A DIRECTOR FOR PSYCHIATRIC CARE-

06:22:44.174 --> 06:22:46.076
AND AB WE'VE WORKED WITH OUR

06:22:46.143 --> 06:22:47.577
LOCAL PROTECTION ADVOCACY

06:22:47.644 --> 06:22:49.012
ORGANIZATION DISABILITY RIGHTS

DO YOU SEEN EACH YEAR WITH THE

06:22:50.847 --> 06:22:53.116
PROJECT WE GO SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE

06:22:53.183 --> 06:22:54.251
EITHER IN COMMUNITY BASED

06:22:54.318 --> 06:22:56.353
PROGRAMS OR ARE ABOUT TO BE.

06:22:56.420 --> 06:22:58.822
DISCHARGED FROM OUT AND WORK

06:22:58.889 --> 06:23:00.724
WITH THEM TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT

06:23:00.791 --> 06:23:01.525
AND THEY EXPRESSED SOME INTEREST

06:23:01.591 --> 06:23:03.760
IN- EXECUTING AN ADVANCE

06:23:03.827 --> 06:23:04.661
DIRECTIVE WHICH BOTH CAN

06:23:04.728 --> 06:23:07.230
INDICATE. WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES

06:23:07.297 --> 06:23:08.932
THEY WANT IF THEY COME TO A

06:23:08.999 --> 06:23:10.500
POINT WHERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

06:23:10.567 --> 06:23:11.968
ARTICULATE BETTER COMMUNICATE

06:23:12.035 --> 06:23:14.404
THAT AT A LATER TIME WHEN I KEY

06:23:14.471 --> 06:23:17.074
EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS AND ALSO

06:23:17.140 --> 06:23:18.809
WHO MIGHT BE A PERSON THEY TRUST

06:23:18.875 --> 06:23:21.078
YOU CAN MAKE SOME SOME JUDGMENTS

06:23:21.144 --> 06:23:21.812
BECAUSE I DO THINK ONE OF THE

06:23:21.878 --> 06:23:24.715
CHALLENGES HERE. IS WHAT LEVEL

06:23:24.781 --> 06:23:26.850
OF ASSESSMENT OF YOUR OF YOUR

06:23:26.917 --> 06:23:29.686
INTEREST LET'S SAY ARE YOU ABLE

06:23:29.753 --> 06:23:31.588
TO ENGAGE AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE

06:23:31.655 --> 06:23:33.990
PRESENCE OF THIS CHALLENGE. SO

06:23:34.057 --> 06:23:35.959
THAT IS A WAY TO BASICALLY IN AT

06:23:36.026 --> 06:23:36.960
A TIME WHEN YOU'RE FEELING

06:23:37.027 --> 06:23:38.628
PRETTY GOOD AND ABLE TO MAKE

06:23:38.695 --> 06:23:39.496
THESE KIND OF CHOICES TO SORT

06:23:39.563 --> 06:23:41.198
OF. PROTECT YOURSELF IN THE

06:23:41.264 --> 06:23:43.233
FUTURE ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

06:23:43.300 --> 06:23:44.401
IF I GET TO A POINT WHERE I

06:23:44.468 --> 06:23:45.902
CAN'T NOW THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT

06:23:45.969 --> 06:23:48.505
WHETHER THAT THAT TRIGGERS. THE

06:23:48.572 --> 06:23:49.806
DOCTORS OTHERWISE HAVE TO FOLLOW

06:23:49.873 --> 06:23:51.441
ITS LEAD DIRECTED BUT IT CAN

06:23:51.508 --> 06:23:52.943
LEAST AT MINIMUM INDICATE WHAT

06:23:53.009 --> 06:23:55.245
THE PREFERENCES AND I GUESS STEP

06:23:55.312 --> 06:23:57.314
YOU KNOW ANOTHER YOUR QUESTION I

06:23:57.381 --> 06:23:58.815
THINK IS SOMETHING WHICH I THINK

06:23:58.882 --> 06:24:00.617
IS VERY DIFFICULT. FOR LAW TO

06:24:00.684 --> 06:24:02.753
ADDRESS MANY IS THE CONTINUING

06:24:02.819 --> 06:24:05.288
STIGMA THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH

06:24:05.355 --> 06:24:11.828
MENTAL ILLNESS. AND WITH THE

06:24:11.895 --> 06:24:12.863
TREATMENT OF. THE WAY WHICH I

06:24:12.929 --> 06:24:14.264
THINK ON THE PANEL. ABOUT THE-

06:24:14.331 --> 06:24:15.065
HISTORICAL THAT'S A OF THE

06:24:15.132 --> 06:24:16.700
SEARCH. ARE STEP OR DID. WHEN

06:24:16.767 --> 06:24:17.434
YOU REALLY KNOW PRETTY REASON

06:24:17.501 --> 06:24:19.302
WHY OUT HOW TO BE THE CASE. SO I

06:24:19.369 --> 06:24:20.670
MEAN LAW DON'T USE THE TERM KNOW

06:24:20.737 --> 06:24:23.407
FIRST NO HARM DR BUT I ACTUALLY

06:24:23.473 --> 06:24:24.474
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

06:24:24.541 --> 06:24:26.143
PERSPECTIVE FOR US. TO HAVE AS

06:24:26.209 --> 06:24:27.544
WELL SO THAT IN THINKING ABOUT

06:24:27.611 --> 06:24:30.580
WHAT STATUTES CAN AND CANNOT DO-

06:24:30.647 --> 06:24:32.082
I THINK THAT TO SOME EXTENT WE

06:24:32.149 --> 06:24:34.518
HAVE TO I. BELIEVE HAVE TO MOVE

06:24:34.584 --> 06:24:36.420
AWAY. FROM THAT KIND OF TENDENCY

06:24:36.486 --> 06:24:40.590
TO JUST. MAKE IT- WELL. HE IS A

06:24:40.657 --> 06:24:42.092
YEAR OR TWO TO DESCRIBE THE

06:24:42.159 --> 06:24:42.993
PROBLEM IS ONE WHERE THE

06:24:43.059 --> 06:24:43.994
PROBLEMS WERE NOT ABLE TO

06:24:44.060 --> 06:24:45.629
CONNECT PEOPLE FOR LONGER TERMS.

06:24:45.695 --> 06:24:46.696
SO WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER TO DO

06:24:46.763 --> 06:24:48.465
THAT AND I WAS. ENCOURAGED BY

06:24:48.532 --> 06:24:50.567
YOU KNOW BY THE- L. PANEL

06:24:50.634 --> 06:24:52.035
MEMBERS I THINK EVERYBODY. MR

06:24:52.102 --> 06:24:53.470
THIS PANEL WAS KIND OF THE SAME

06:24:53.537 --> 06:24:55.839
MIND WHICH IS. NOT NO WE DON'T

06:24:55.906 --> 06:24:56.840
WANT TO GET AWAY FROM COURSE OF

06:24:56.907 --> 06:24:58.175
TREATMENT WANT TO GET AWAY FROM

06:24:58.241 --> 06:25:00.343
LONG TERM TREATMENT. WE WANT TO

06:25:00.410 --> 06:25:01.778
TURN PEOPLE AROUND AS QUICKLY AS

06:25:01.845 --> 06:25:04.014
WE CAN SO I THINK LAW HAS TO. BE

06:25:04.080 --> 06:25:05.549
CONSISTENT WITH THAT AND I WILL

06:25:05.615 --> 06:25:06.783
SAY THAT OVER TIME LOOKING AT

06:25:06.850 --> 06:25:09.853
THIS. AND CALIFORNIA BUT MORE

06:25:09.920 --> 06:25:11.555
GENERALLY. TOO OFTEN WE'VE HAD

06:25:11.621 --> 06:25:13.156
POLICIES THAT WORK ACROSS

06:25:13.223 --> 06:25:14.925
PURPOSES WE HAVE. FUNDING

06:25:14.991 --> 06:25:16.059
STATUTES WHICH WILL IN ONE

06:25:16.126 --> 06:25:17.861
DIRECTION INCONSISTENT WITH THE

06:25:17.928 --> 06:25:19.563
CONSTITUTIONAL. PROTECTIONS WE

06:25:19.629 --> 06:25:21.164
MIGHT HAVE BUT- LAST THING I

06:25:21.231 --> 06:25:23.400
GUESS I'LL SAY IS. I THINK YOU

06:25:23.467 --> 06:25:25.068
YOU. HAVE HEARD WILL HEAR FROM

06:25:25.135 --> 06:25:26.536
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST AFFECTED.

06:25:26.603 --> 06:25:27.871
LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN PUBLIC

06:25:27.938 --> 06:25:29.873
POLICY- YOU CAN SIT IN YOUR

06:25:29.940 --> 06:25:31.308
IVORY TOWER TRYING TO IDENTIFY

06:25:31.374 --> 06:25:33.276
WHAT. THE RIGHT INTEREST MIGHT

06:25:33.343 --> 06:25:34.377
BE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

06:25:34.444 --> 06:25:35.312
HERE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST

06:25:35.378 --> 06:25:37.247
AFFECTED. WHAT WOULD THEY FIND

06:25:37.314 --> 06:25:38.315
TO BE. SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

06:25:38.381 --> 06:25:39.749
HELPFUL TO THEM. RATHER THAN

06:25:39.816 --> 06:25:40.750
SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO BE

06:25:40.817 --> 06:25:42.586
FORCED TO AND THAT'S- NOT ONLY

06:25:42.652 --> 06:25:43.854
THE INDIVIDUALS BUT FAMILY

06:25:43.920 --> 06:25:46.389
MEMBERS. OTHER STAKEHOLDERS

06:25:46.456 --> 06:25:49.493
RIGHT HAVE A- WHAT PERSPECTIVE.

06:25:52.696 --> 06:25:54.364
FINAL QUESTION ON THAT SAID TO

06:25:54.431 --> 06:25:56.366
MISTER EWING- IT'S FAIR TO SAY

06:25:56.433 --> 06:25:57.501

QUESTION- CAREFUL IN THE IN THE

06:26:12.649 --> 06:26:15.051
LPS ARENA HOW HE MAKES SUCCESS

06:26:15.118 --> 06:26:17.120
EASIER AND FAILURE MORE

06:26:17.187 --> 06:26:20.957
DIFFICULT. VISIT THE EASY

06:26:21.024 --> 06:26:25.862
QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR IT- YOU

06:26:25.929 --> 06:26:26.930
KNOW OUR OUR MENTAL HEALTH

06:26:26.997 --> 06:26:28.665
SYSTEM IS DESIGNED AROUND SORT

06:26:28.732 --> 06:26:30.000
OF YOU KNOW WE SET RULES ABOUT

06:26:30.066 --> 06:26:31.968
WHAT WHAT WE WILL DO WHAT WE CAN

06:26:32.035 --> 06:26:34.938
PAY FOR RIGHT AND THERE'S WE

06:26:35.005 --> 06:26:36.139
ALSO HAVE RULES ABOUT WHAT MUST

06:26:36.206 --> 06:26:37.774
BE PAID FOR SO THE EXAMPLE OF

06:26:37.841 --> 06:26:39.109
FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS RIGHT

06:26:39.175 --> 06:26:40.343
EVEN WITHIN THE REALIGNMENT

06:26:40.410 --> 06:26:41.978
RELATIONSHIP WITH COUNTIES. AND

06:26:42.045 --> 06:26:44.047
THEN AS SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT

06:26:44.114 --> 06:26:44.614
THEN THERE'S THINGS THAT THE

06:26:44.681 --> 06:26:46.583
STATE JUST PAYS FOR. IS THE

06:26:46.650 --> 06:26:48.885
REASON THIS IS HARD IS. A

06:26:48.952 --> 06:26:50.687
VARIETY OF THINGS ONE WE DON'T

06:26:50.754 --> 06:26:53.056
HAVE CLEAR MODELS. AND SO

06:26:53.123 --> 06:26:54.424
THERE'S WIDE VARIATION ACROSS

06:26:54.491 --> 06:26:55.859
COUNTIES AND SO YOU THAT YOU'RE

06:26:55.926 --> 06:26:57.761
SEEING SOME EXAMPLES HERE THE

06:26:57.827 --> 06:26:59.362
CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING

06:26:59.429 --> 06:27:00.063
AROUND PSYCHIATRIC EVENTS

06:27:00.130 --> 06:27:02.198
DIRECTORS IN WASHINGTON YOU IT

06:27:02.265 --> 06:27:03.633
IS VERY DIFFICULT WHAT WHAT

06:27:03.700 --> 06:27:04.968
COUNTIES OFTEN STRUGGLE WITH

06:27:05.035 --> 06:27:06.570
WHAT THEY SHARE WITH US. IS

06:27:06.636 --> 06:27:08.071
UNDERSTANDING WHAT A BEST

06:27:08.138 --> 06:27:10.073
PRACTICES AND WHAT THEY SHOULD

06:27:10.140 --> 06:27:11.575
BE IMPLEMENTING IT CAN BE VERY

06:27:11.641 --> 06:27:12.909
DIFFICULT THERE OFTEN SORT OF ON

06:27:12.976 --> 06:27:14.778
THEIR OWN TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND

06:27:14.844 --> 06:27:16.046
THAT AND THAT CAN BE VERY

06:27:16.112 --> 06:27:17.414
IMPORTANT WHEN IT'S YOUR

06:27:17.480 --> 06:27:19.549
DISTRICT AND IT'S TAILORED TO. A

06:27:19.616 --> 06:27:21.384
RURAL COASTAL COMMUNITY WHICH IS

06:27:21.451 --> 06:27:22.586
VERY DIFFERENT FROM LOS ANGELES

06:27:22.652 --> 06:27:25.121
OR- IN YOU KNOW OR IMPERIAL

06:27:25.188 --> 06:27:28.058
COUNTY. BUT IT ALSO CAN MEAN-

06:27:28.124 --> 06:27:30.527
THAT THEY'LL STRUGGLE TO S. C.

06:27:30.594 --> 06:27:31.628
THEIR SYSTEMS EVOLVE IN WAYS

06:27:31.695 --> 06:27:33.396
THAT RESULT IN. HAD THE

06:27:33.463 --> 06:27:35.465
EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT CARE THAT

06:27:35.532 --> 06:27:36.166
LEADS TO THE RIGHT KINDS OF

06:27:36.232 --> 06:27:38.168
OUTCOMES. SO IF YOU KNOW THE

06:27:38.234 --> 06:27:39.302
STATE IS IN A POSITION

06:27:39.369 --> 06:27:40.870
PARTICULARLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

06:27:40.937 --> 06:27:42.706
OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERS AND

06:27:42.772 --> 06:27:44.841
OTHERS. TO REALLY IDENTIFY WITH

06:27:44.908 --> 06:27:46.209
THESE MODELS ARE AND TO

06:27:46.276 --> 06:27:48.378
INCENTIVIZE AND JUST TO CLARIFY

06:27:48.445 --> 06:27:50.447
THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY EXAMPLE IS

06:27:50.513 --> 06:27:51.214
ACTUALLY FINE WITH IMAGE THE

06:27:51.281 --> 06:27:52.882
INNOVATION FUNDS. IN THE

06:27:52.949 --> 06:27:54.551
QUESTIONS EXPLORING THE IDEA OF

06:27:54.618 --> 06:27:56.286
USING SOME OF OUR SB EIGHTY TO

06:27:56.353 --> 06:27:57.621
TRIAGE FUNDS TO INCENTIVIZE

06:27:57.687 --> 06:27:59.489
COUNTIES. TO WORK WITH THEIR

06:27:59.556 --> 06:28:01.658
COMMUNITY HOSPITAL PARTNERS. TO

06:28:01.725 --> 06:28:03.560
ADOPT SOME OF THE SAMPATH MODELS

06:28:03.627 --> 06:28:04.861
SO. YOU KNOW IT IT'S ABOUT

06:28:04.928 --> 06:28:06.796
MAKING IT EASIER FOR OUR

06:28:06.863 --> 06:28:07.631
COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO BE

06:28:07.697 --> 06:28:09.799
SUCCESSFUL. IT FROM A KNOWLEDGE

06:28:09.866 --> 06:28:11.067
BASIS PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL

06:28:11.134 --> 06:28:12.268
ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING THAT IS

06:28:12.335 --> 06:28:13.570
NECESSARY BECAUSE IT CAN BE VERY

06:28:13.637 --> 06:28:14.738
DIFFICULT. FROM COUNTY

06:28:14.804 --> 06:28:16.640
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO

06:28:16.706 --> 06:28:18.308
UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT THE

06:28:18.375 --> 06:28:20.343
KNOWLEDGE BASIS THAT'S SPECIALLY

06:28:20.410 --> 06:28:21.978
FOR SMALLER COUNTIES THAT DON'T

06:28:22.045 --> 06:28:23.513
HAVE THE STAFF TO GO LOOKING AND

06:28:23.580 --> 06:28:25.782
LEARNING FROM. AS FAR AWAY AS DC

06:28:25.849 --> 06:28:27.350
AROUND THE KINDS OF PROJECTS

06:28:27.417 --> 06:28:28.685
THAT MIGHT BE DEPLOYED OR EVEN

06:28:28.752 --> 06:28:30.754
OUT OF STATE. SO IDENTIFYING

06:28:30.820 --> 06:28:32.122
MODELS DEVELOPING TECHNICAL

06:28:32.188 --> 06:28:33.723
ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING CREATING

06:28:33.790 --> 06:28:36.493
CLEAR FINANCING PATHS. IF THIS

06:28:36.559 --> 06:28:38.461
ISN'T AS EASY TO FIND IT'S MORE

06:28:38.528 --> 06:28:39.829
LIKELY TO BE EASY TO IMPLEMENT

06:28:39.896 --> 06:28:41.031
OF IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TO

06:28:41.097 --> 06:28:43.099
FIND. IT IS GOING TO BE A

06:28:43.166 --> 06:28:45.301
HEAVIER LEFT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE

06:28:45.368 --> 06:28:47.337
TYPICALLY ONLY THE MOST ARDENT

06:28:47.404 --> 06:28:49.806
CHAMPIONS. CLIMB UP THAT THE

06:28:49.873 --> 06:28:52.742
FINANCIAL HILDA FIGURE OUT HOW-TO IMPLEMENT. THEM THAT IS

06:28:52.809 --> 06:28:54.811
WORKING AGAINST STREAM. IT IN

06:28:54.878 --> 06:28:55.645
THE SAME THING IS TRUE AROUND

06:28:55.712 --> 06:28:56.746
STAFFING IF THERE'S CLEAR

06:28:56.813 --> 06:28:58.448
STAFFING STRATEGIES PARTICULARLY

06:28:58.515 --> 06:29:00.250
AROUND GUIDANCE TO IT TO

06:29:00.316 --> 06:29:02.085
FIDELITY TO THESE MODELS SUCH AS

06:29:02.152 --> 06:29:02.819
THE ROLE APPEARS THAT'S VERY

06:29:02.886 --> 06:29:04.854
HELPFUL. AND LAST THING I WOULD

06:29:04.921 --> 06:29:06.589
SAY. DOING THE DATE IN THE

06:29:06.656 --> 06:29:13.096
ANALYTICS SO THAT THE POLICY.

06:29:13.163 --> 06:29:13.596
POLITICAL AND COMMUNITY

06:29:13.663 --> 06:29:14.264
INCENTIVES. TRY ATTENTION TO THE

06:29:14.330 --> 06:29:16.599
NEED TO ACTUALLY GET BETTER AT

06:29:16.666 --> 06:29:18.001
THIS OVER TIME SO IF SOME

06:29:18.068 --> 06:29:19.102
COMMUNITIES ARE ADOPTING

06:29:19.169 --> 06:29:20.503
PROGRAMS WHERE THEY'RE SEEING.

06:29:20.570 --> 06:29:22.405
THEIR INVOLUNTARY RATES GO DOWN

06:29:22.472 --> 06:29:24.174
ANOTHER COMMUNITIES ARE NOT HOW

06:29:24.240 --> 06:29:25.475
DO WE MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE

06:29:25.542 --> 06:29:26.643
WHO ARE IN THOSE PLACES WHERE

06:29:26.710 --> 06:29:27.811
THEY'RE NOT GOING DOWN TO

06:29:27.877 --> 06:29:29.045
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STRATEGIES

06:29:29.112 --> 06:29:30.413
ARE. AND HOW DO WE CREATE THAT

06:29:30.480 --> 06:29:32.582
SUPPORT AT HOME. SO THEY CAN BE

06:29:32.649 --> 06:29:35.885
SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU FOR THE

INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION AND

06:32:33.930 --> 06:32:35.932
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. BUT THIS

06:32:35.999 --> 06:32:38.201
IS A SAFETY NET SYSTEM AND THESE

06:32:38.268 --> 06:32:39.235

THE CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE.

06:32:46.242 --> 06:32:48.211
RATHER CALIFORNIA SHOULD INVEST

06:32:48.278 --> 06:32:50.079
IN PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION

06:32:50.146 --> 06:32:52.382

CALIFORNIANS WITH BEHAVIORAL

06:32:54.884 --> 06:32:56.319

06:33:07.830 --> 06:33:09.299
MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES THAT CAN

06:33:09.365 --> 06:33:10.767
DIVERT INDIVIDUALS FROM

06:33:10.833 --> 06:33:14.304
AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS AND

UNABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR OWN

06:33:49.038 --> 06:33:51.040
BASIC NEEDS. WHEN THEY DO NOT

LAW. TO ATTRACT DATA WE HEARD

06:34:23.740 --> 06:34:24.440
SOME OF THE ISSUES WITH THAT

06:34:24.507 --> 06:34:26.109
TODAY PROCESS TO RESOLVE

SPECIFICALLY THIS LEADERSHIP

06:34:38.721 --> 06:34:40.590
COULD DO SOME OF THE FOLLOWING.

06:34:40.656 --> 06:34:43.292
FIRST ENABLE REVIEW OF EXISTING

06:34:43.359 --> 06:34:45.461
DOJ DATA AND REFORM REPORTING

06:34:45.528 --> 06:34:47.463
REQUIREMENTS SO THAT POLICY

06:34:47.530 --> 06:34:49.432
MAKERS CAN ACCURATELY EVALUATE

06:34:49.499 --> 06:34:53.069
LPS TRANSALPINE AND THE ADEQUACY

06:34:53.136 --> 06:34:55.171
OF EXISTING RESOURCES. AS AN

06:34:55.238 --> 06:34:56.539
EXAMPLE THE AUDIT FOUND THAT

06:34:56.606 --> 06:34:57.673
MANY INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT

06:34:57.740 --> 06:34:59.342
CONNECTED TO ADEQUATE SERVICES

06:34:59.409 --> 06:35:01.744
FOLLOWING LPS HOLD. A STATE

06:35:01.811 --> 06:35:03.179
ENTITY COULD CLARIFY THE

06:35:03.246 --> 06:35:05.248
EXPECTATIONS FOR FOLLOW UP CARE

06:35:05.314 --> 06:35:07.050

ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTIVES. TO

06:35:14.957 --> 06:35:16.726
CLARIFY AREAS WHERE THE L. P. S.

06:35:18.728 --> 06:35:19.996
FOR EXAMPLE A STATE ENTITY COULD

06:35:20.063 --> 06:35:22.265
HELP CLARIFY WHEN THE CLOCK ON

06:35:22.331 --> 06:35:25.034
LPS HOLD BEGINS. THIRD IT COULD

06:35:25.101 --> 06:35:26.803
SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND DEVELOP

06:35:26.869 --> 06:35:28.037

06:35:34.744 --> 06:35:36.245
COULD ENSURE THE INVOLVEMENT OF

06:35:36.312 --> 06:35:37.647
MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS AND

06:35:37.713 --> 06:35:39.982

06:35:44.854 --> 06:35:46.856
SUPPORTS MODERNIZING THE OPS ACT

06:47:16.812 --> 06:47:18.647
SAMPLES FOR CARE. IN THE END-

06:47:25.621 --> 06:47:27.856
ISSUES HERE- AND I AND I WOULD

06:47:27.923 --> 06:47:29.224
REMISS IF I DID. HONOR THE

06:47:29.291 --> 06:47:31.126
TESTIMONY A JURY PASSED WE NEED

06:47:31.193 --> 06:47:33.729
EARLIER THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF

06:47:33.796 --> 06:47:38.100
. INNER ECHOES- TO PSYCHIATRISTS

06:47:38.167 --> 06:47:41.403
VERY STRONGLY. SO YOU KNOW I

06:47:41.470 --> 06:47:43.105
THINK I'M ONE OF THE THINGS I

06:47:43.172 --> 06:47:44.373
WANT ONE POINT YOU WANTED TO

06:47:44.439 --> 06:47:46.742
MAKE WAS THAT IT YOU KNOW OUR

06:47:46.809 --> 06:47:49.211
OUR OUR LPS SYSTEMS CRISIS

06:47:49.278 --> 06:47:51.547
DRIVEN. AND TREATMENT SCHEELE OR

06:47:51.613 --> 06:47:53.816
DRIVEN AND I THINK THAT'S NOT

06:47:53.882 --> 06:47:55.017
TOO UNSURPRISING GIVEN THE

06:47:55.083 --> 06:47:56.552
NATURE OF THE SYSTEM. I

06:47:56.618 --> 06:47:58.453
PROVIDING EMERGENCY CARE UNDER

06:47:58.520 --> 06:47:59.655
SITUATIONS OR PEOPLE ARE

06:47:59.721 --> 06:48:01.523
DANGEROUS OR GRAVELY DISABLED

06:48:01.590 --> 06:48:04.259
BUT- WHEN WE MAKE IS THAT- THAT

06:48:04.326 --> 06:48:06.995
DEPENDS ON WAITING FOR DANGER I

06:48:07.062 --> 06:48:08.096
THINK SOMETIMES FOR SOME

06:48:08.163 --> 06:48:09.898
PATIENTS. WAITING FOR THAT THE

06:48:09.965 --> 06:48:13.435
INTEREST TOO LATE- IT MAKES

06:48:13.502 --> 06:48:16.004
OUTCOMES WORSE FOR PATIENTS.

06:48:16.071 --> 06:48:20.175
YEAH IT DOESN'T HELP FAMILIES-

06:48:20.242 --> 06:48:23.345
IT MAKES HAS NOT PROCESS SAID IN

06:48:23.412 --> 06:48:25.747
A PSYCHIATRIST WAIT FOR ORDERS

06:48:25.814 --> 06:48:27.683
TO TREAT WHILE WEEKS CAN GO BY

06:48:27.749 --> 06:48:30.319
AND HOSPITALS. BEFORE TREATMENT

06:48:30.385 --> 06:48:31.887
CAN ACTUALLY BE APPLIED THERE

06:48:31.954 --> 06:48:33.856
ARE THERE A LOT OF DOWNSIDES TO

06:48:33.922 --> 06:48:35.457
THAT SYSTEM WE UNDERSTAND THAT

06:48:35.524 --> 06:48:37.826
THE NEEDS FOR. THE INVOLUNTARY

06:48:37.893 --> 06:48:39.027
TREATMENT STANDARDS IN THE

06:48:39.094 --> 06:48:40.929
PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUAL

06:48:40.996 --> 06:48:42.965
LIBERTIES AND CIVIL RIGHTS. BUT

06:48:43.031 --> 06:48:45.300
IT ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE ARK OF

06:48:45.367 --> 06:48:47.169
INDIVIDUALS IN FRANCE AND SEND

06:48:47.236 --> 06:48:49.371
UP IN STATE HOSPITALS- AND

06:48:49.438 --> 06:48:51.306
THAT'S AN END POINT FOR MANY AND

06:48:51.373 --> 06:48:52.608
THAT MEANS THAT IT'S EITHER A

06:48:52.674 --> 06:48:54.543
LOW POINT- THE LOWEST POINT IN

06:48:54.610 --> 06:48:56.545
THEIR PERSONAL HISTORIES. WHERE

06:48:56.612 --> 06:48:58.046
THEY BURNED THROUGH RESOURCES IN

06:48:58.113 --> 06:48:59.615
THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE ABLE TO

06:48:59.681 --> 06:49:02.317
HELP THEM- AND IF YOU LOOK AT

06:49:02.384 --> 06:49:04.820
THAT DATA ARC- YOU KNOW THROUGH

06:49:04.887 --> 06:49:06.388
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AND IF YOU

06:49:06.455 --> 06:49:07.656
LOOK AT THAT ARGUE CAN PROBABLY

06:49:07.723 --> 06:49:14.296
IDENTIFY MANY MISSED.

06:49:14.363 --> 06:49:14.930
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERVENTIONS

06:49:14.997 --> 06:49:15.797
AND TREATMENT. AND IT THAT KIND

06:49:15.864 --> 06:49:17.466
OF ALLOWS US TO THE HOLES. OF

06:49:17.532 --> 06:49:19.201
ENTER- YOU KNOW THIS DIDN'T

06:49:19.268 --> 06:49:20.903
REALLY. UP HERE. YOU KNOW

06:49:20.969 --> 06:49:23.472
STRICTLY IN THE L. P. AND SPELL

06:49:23.538 --> 06:49:24.840
THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL

06:49:24.907 --> 06:49:26.475
A OF JESUS IS NOT PATIENT

06:49:26.541 --> 06:49:28.277
TREATMENT OR LARA'S LAW STATUTE

06:49:28.343 --> 06:49:30.279
IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. AND I

06:49:30.345 --> 06:49:32.114
THINK THERE IS A PARADIGM THAT

06:49:32.180 --> 06:49:33.448
WE COULD LOOK AT THAT MIGHT HAVE

06:49:33.515 --> 06:49:36.218
WIDER APPLE APPLICABILITY. YOU

06:49:36.285 --> 06:49:38.287
THINK ABOUT THE PARADIGM- IT'S

06:49:38.353 --> 06:49:42.958
ABOUT- LOOKING AT A PERSON'S

06:49:43.025 --> 06:49:45.928
HISTORY- AS THE BEST PREDICTOR

06:49:45.994 --> 06:49:48.563
OF FUTURE CONSEQUENCES- SO

06:49:48.630 --> 06:49:52.200
SOMEBODY HAS AS A- AIR T. ****

06:49:52.267 --> 06:49:54.436
THE REQUIRED. TO INCIDENTS OF-

06:49:54.503 --> 06:49:57.606
HOSPITALIZATION TO REST- WITHIN

06:49:57.673 --> 06:49:59.775
A CERTAIN TIME OR ACTS OR

06:49:59.841 --> 06:50:01.977
THREATS OF VIOLENCE. YOU CAN

06:50:02.044 --> 06:50:06.748
PRETTY WELL YOU KNOW- ANTICIPATE

06:50:06.815 --> 06:50:10.052
THAT IF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

06:50:10.118 --> 06:50:11.053
ARE GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN THEY'RE

06:50:11.119 --> 06:50:11.720
GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF

06:50:11.787 --> 06:50:13.188
PERSONS IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE

06:50:13.255 --> 06:50:14.756
DETERIORATING THEY'RE NOT

06:50:14.823 --> 06:50:16.658
RECEIVING AN ADEQUATE LEVEL

06:50:16.725 --> 06:50:18.427
SERVICES AND THEY WILL HAPPEN

06:50:18.493 --> 06:50:21.930
AGAIN. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF

06:50:21.997 --> 06:50:23.565
HISTORY BEING ABLE TO ELL US

06:50:23.632 --> 06:50:25.434
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE CERTAIN

06:50:25.500 --> 06:50:27.536
THRESHOLDS AFTER WHICH-

06:50:27.602 --> 06:50:32.307
AUTHORIZATION IS- IS PROVIDED

06:50:32.374 --> 06:50:35.277

WE'VE IMPROVE THE ORIGINAL

06:50:43.118 --> 06:50:44.486
STATUTES AND OUR THRESHOLD IS

06:50:44.553 --> 06:50:46.288
BECOME AN INTERVENTION TO

06:50:46.355 --> 06:50:49.358
PREVENT- A RELAPSE OR

06:50:49.424 --> 06:50:50.959
DETERIORATION THAT WOULD LIKELY

06:50:51.026 --> 06:50:53.128
RESULT IN GREAT DISABILITY OR

06:50:53.195 --> 06:50:54.730
SERIOUS HARM TO OTHERS IS REALLY

06:50:54.796 --> 06:50:56.798
IMPORTANT WE CAPITALIST TOOLS

06:50:56.865 --> 06:50:58.633
THAT WE CAN GET UPSTREAM. WE CAN

06:50:58.700 --> 06:51:01.403
MAKE THE INNOVATION INNOVATION-

06:51:01.470 --> 06:51:03.638
OF EARLY INTERVENTION HAPPENED

06:51:03.705 --> 06:51:04.873
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE L. P.

06:51:04.940 --> 06:51:09.478

ORDERED. THERE ARE A LOT TESTING

06:51:16.018 --> 06:51:17.119
THIS LAST YEAR PARTICULARLY IN

06:51:17.185 --> 06:51:19.421
BUDGET PROCESSES WHERE. WE

06:51:19.488 --> 06:51:20.689
REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY

06:51:20.756 --> 06:51:22.057
PERSONALLY REALIZE THIS UNTIL

06:51:22.124 --> 06:51:24.960
MUCH LATER THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

06:51:25.027 --> 06:51:26.161
A LOT OF STATUTES ON THE BOOKS

06:51:26.228 --> 06:51:28.663
THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS TWO BLACK

06:51:28.730 --> 06:51:30.699
CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISIONS.

06:51:30.766 --> 06:51:32.968
ABOUT MEDICATIONS THERE ARE

06:51:33.035 --> 06:51:35.237
PROCEDURES AND STATUTES. THAT

06:51:35.303 --> 06:51:36.872
HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR A

06:51:36.938 --> 06:51:38.774
WHILE THAT ALLOW MEDICATION TO

06:51:38.840 --> 06:51:40.909
BE ORDERED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS

06:51:40.976 --> 06:51:42.577
EVEN OVER THEIR OBJECTIONS AND

06:51:42.644 --> 06:51:44.780
THAT'S IN AID OF A STABILIZING

06:51:44.846 --> 06:51:47.382
THEM AND HELPING THEM- WILL

06:51:47.449 --> 06:51:50.052
ALONG TO THE ROAD TO RECOVERY-

06:51:50.118 --> 06:51:51.887
AND THOSE ARE NOT BEING USED IN

06:51:51.953 --> 06:51:53.588
IN IN A COUPLE OF CNTEXT DOCTOR

06:51:53.655 --> 06:51:55.791
CYSTS AND- MENTIONED THAT IN IN

06:51:55.857 --> 06:51:57.959
PATIENT SETTINGS- WE HAVE

06:51:58.026 --> 06:51:59.795
SOMETHING CALLED THE RESEARCHER.

06:51:59.861 --> 06:52:01.329
AND THAT'S WHERE COURT CAST

06:52:01.396 --> 06:52:03.732
CATASTROPHE- TO ACTUALLY MAKE

06:52:03.799 --> 06:52:06.101
DECISIONS PARTICULARLY DECISION

KNOW BASICALLY PSYCHIATRISTS AND

06:52:18.780 --> 06:52:20.315
OTHER TREATMENT PEOPLE ARE

06:52:20.382 --> 06:52:21.583
SITTING ON THEIR HANDS WAITING

06:52:21.650 --> 06:52:23.385
FOR TREATMENT AND THAT WHEN A

06:52:23.452 --> 06:52:25.454
PROLONGED STAYS IN IN PATIENT

06:52:25.520 --> 06:52:27.355

SUFFERING OF THE INDIVIDUAL IT'S

06:52:29.024 --> 06:52:31.626
COST MORE FOR THE ARE

FOR THAT CARE. AND YOU KNOW

06:52:34.896 --> 06:52:36.364
THERE AE WAYS THAT WE CAN THINK

06:52:36.431 --> 06:52:39.067
ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE THE TRYING

06:52:39.134 --> 06:52:41.703
TO GET AND A DETERMINATION ABOUT

06:52:41.770 --> 06:52:44.773
WHO HAS CAPACITY DOESN'T AND ONE

06:52:44.840 --> 06:52:47.709
OF ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE

06:52:47.776 --> 06:52:50.545
LPS REFORM TASK FORCE- ADDITION

06:52:50.612 --> 06:52:53.281

ELEVEN WAS TO TELESCOPE. THE

06:52:55.016 --> 06:52:56.885
WHOLE IDEA OF A PROBABLE CAUSE

06:52:56.952 --> 06:52:58.420
HEARING ALONG WITH THE CAPACITY

06:52:58.487 --> 06:53:01.022
DETERMINATION SO THAT YOU YOU

06:53:01.089 --> 06:53:02.791
INITIATE THESE THINGS BUT THEN

06:53:02.858 --> 06:53:08.263
HOURS OF AN INDIVIDUAL- BEING-

06:53:08.330 --> 06:53:11.266
BROUGHT TO A FACILITY- WORK WHEN

06:53:11.333 --> 06:53:12.801
THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING

06:53:12.868 --> 06:53:16.004
EVALUATED FOR ADMISSIONS ON A

06:53:16.071 --> 06:53:16.872
FIFTY ONE FIFTY YOU ALSO DO IT

06:53:16.938 --> 06:53:19.174
CAPACITY PASS AND YOU CAN START

06:53:19.241 --> 06:53:21.209
A PROCESS THERE MUCH EARLIER TO

06:53:21.276 --> 06:53:23.879
GET NEEDED NECESSARY APPROPRIATE

ALLEVIATE SUFFERING YOU CAN

06:53:29.684 --> 06:53:31.686
REDUCES DAY YOU CAN HAVE MORE

06:53:31.753 --> 06:53:33.088
THROUGH PET- HAVE MORE

06:53:33.155 --> 06:53:34.322
EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF THE

BEDS YOU HAVE BY SERVING MORE

06:53:36.591 --> 06:53:41.930

KEEP IN MIND- THEY THE NEEDS I'M

06:53:44.633 --> 06:53:45.367
GONNA MOVE ON HERE TO ANOTHER

06:53:45.433 --> 06:53:48.003
POINT THE OVER. AND SINGLE POINT

OF RESPONSE- TO CHAIRMAN LLOYD-

06:53:51.406 --> 06:53:53.408
IS REALLY CRITICAL- I THINK WE

06:53:53.475 --> 06:53:54.976
LOST SOME OF THAT WILL BE LOST

06:53:55.043 --> 06:53:56.978
THE OLD DEPARTMENT AND HEALTH.

06:53:57.045 --> 06:53:58.880
AND I'M AND I'M NOT SURE SURE

06:53:58.947 --> 06:54:00.282
THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE REVISITING

06:54:00.348 --> 06:54:02.517
THAT ISSUE DO WE NEED WHAT ARE

06:54:02.584 --> 06:54:04.553
THE RESPECT TO ARE VERY CAPABLE

06:54:04.619 --> 06:54:07.189
AND DEDICATED- STAFFING

06:54:07.255 --> 06:54:09.191
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

06:54:09.257 --> 06:54:11.927
YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED AGENCIES

06:54:11.993 --> 06:54:15.297
THAT CAN PROVIDE- WHAT IS IN MY

06:54:15.363 --> 06:54:17.065
VIEW NT BEING PROVIDED NOW TO

06:54:17.132 --> 06:54:19.267
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- WORKING

06:54:19.334 --> 06:54:22.237
WITH- THEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN EGGMAN

06:54:22.304 --> 06:54:23.939
IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE

06:54:24.005 --> 06:54:26.308
PASSED AB ELEVEN FOUR. AND THAT

06:54:26.374 --> 06:54:29.077
CHANGED A LITTLE BIT NINE IT WAS

06:54:29.144 --> 06:54:31.213
A CLARIFICATION OF WHAT DANGER.

06:54:31.279 --> 06:54:33.081
IN THE LPS. AND WE SAID

06:54:33.148 --> 06:54:34.983
BASICALLY IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT

06:54:35.050 --> 06:54:37.052
CONFINED IT WAS NEVER INTENDED

06:54:37.118 --> 06:54:38.820
TO BE CONFINED. TO THE CONCEPT

06:54:38.887 --> 06:54:41.122
OF IMMINENT DANGER NEW YORK WE

06:54:41.189 --> 06:54:41.656
NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

06:54:41.723 --> 06:54:44.059
HISTORY. HISTORY WILL TELL YOU

06:54:44.125 --> 06:54:45.961
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE SMEBODY

06:54:46.027 --> 06:54:48.530
IN FRONT OF YOU WHO MAY BE ON

06:54:48.597 --> 06:54:50.532
THE EDGE OF BEING DANGEROUS EVEN

06:54:50.599 --> 06:54:51.333
THOUGH THEY'RE NOT READY TO

06:54:51.399 --> 06:54:56.071
THROW A BRICK THROUGH. THE

06:54:56.137 --> 06:54:57.405
WINDOW THEY DON'T. HAVE A

06:54:57.472 --> 06:54:58.406
BASEBALL BAT OR THEY'RE NOT

06:54:58.473 --> 06:55:01.843
SPREE AND- IN CHESTER AGAIN LAW

06:55:01.910 --> 06:55:02.644
. OKAY SO WE HAVE THIS. ON THE

06:55:02.711 --> 06:55:04.346
BAR. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS

06:55:04.412 --> 06:55:05.680
IS ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS

06:55:05.747 --> 06:55:08.483
IN STATE I GET. ONE FORSMAN

06:55:08.550 --> 06:55:10.752
AGENCY TRAINING OFFICERS COME UP

06:55:10.819 --> 06:55:12.721
TO ME AND SAY CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO

06:55:12.787 --> 06:55:14.723
ME WHAT THE STATUTE MEANS HOW DO

06:55:14.789 --> 06:55:17.859
I TRAIN TO THIS. SO IT RAISES

06:55:17.926 --> 06:55:18.893
THE QUESTION THE LARGER

06:55:18.960 --> 06:55:21.162
QUESTION. OF WHO PROVIDES THE

06:55:21.229 --> 06:55:23.064
GUIDANCE THAT IS NEEDED OUT

06:55:23.131 --> 06:55:25.533
THERE FOR IN THIS INSTANCE.

06:55:25.600 --> 06:55:27.335
THOSE AGENCIES WHAT DOES THAT

06:55:27.402 --> 06:55:29.237
MEAN POWER THAT YOU IMPLEMENT

06:55:29.304 --> 06:55:31.539
LAW. AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

06:55:31.606 --> 06:55:32.540
THAT NO MATTER HOW MANY

06:55:32.607 --> 06:55:35.710
STATUTORY TWEAKS THAT WE MAY. TO

06:55:35.777 --> 06:55:39.214
THE L. P. S. THE IMPLEMENTATION

06:55:39.281 --> 06:55:40.348
IS NINE TENTHS OF BIG. I'M AND

06:55:40.415 --> 06:55:42.183
IN MY VIEW THE VIEW OF SKY WE

06:55:42.250 --> 06:55:43.752
NEED A SINGLE OR A POINT OF

06:55:43.818 --> 06:55:45.453
AUTHORITY. WITHIN STATE

06:55:45.520 --> 06:55:46.688
GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT

06:55:46.755 --> 06:55:48.556
THERE'S A CONSISTENT APPLICATION

06:55:48.623 --> 06:55:50.558
OF THE LAW. AND WE SEE THAT AS A

06:55:50.625 --> 06:55:52.961
PROBLEM FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AS

06:55:53.028 --> 06:55:55.597
WELL AS WITHIN COUNTIES- NEEDS

06:55:55.664 --> 06:55:56.564
TO BE SOMEONE TO PROVIDE

06:55:56.631 --> 06:55:57.966
INFORMED GUIDANCE TO LOCAL

06:55:58.033 --> 06:55:59.834
AUTHORITIES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

06:55:59.901 --> 06:56:02.504
TO COUNTIES- SURE FUNDING AS

06:56:02.570 --> 06:56:04.539
WELL SPENT AND ANALYSES. OF DATA

06:56:04.606 --> 06:56:06.975
ON HOW CAN BE BETTER SPENT- TO

06:56:07.042 --> 06:56:08.576
DO THAT WILL BE CRITICAL AND

06:56:08.643 --> 06:56:11.146
NECESSARY DATA COLLECTION. SO

06:56:11.212 --> 06:56:13.415
LET ME END ON THIS FINAL POINT

06:56:13.481 --> 06:56:15.317
BECAUSE ADULTS IT TAKES THAT

06:56:15.383 --> 06:56:17.752
POINT A BIT FURTHER- WE'RE VERY

06:56:17.819 --> 06:56:19.020
I WAS VERY GRATEFUL THAT

06:56:19.087 --> 06:56:21.656
ASSEMBLY WOMAN- REYES PRODUCT.

06:56:21.723 --> 06:56:23.158
THE DATA ISSUE AND IT'S ACTUALLY

06:56:23.224 --> 06:56:24.626
SOMETHING WE WORK WITH SENATOR

06:56:24.693 --> 06:56:26.594
EGGMAN ON IT AS YOU YOU KNOW

06:56:26.661 --> 06:56:31.466
WHEN SB. FOUR SIXTY FIVE. SO IN

06:56:31.533 --> 06:56:33.201
ADDITION TO THE CAN. AND QUALITY

06:56:33.268 --> 06:56:35.136
OF REPORTS. THAT COUNTY SANTA

06:56:35.203 --> 06:56:37.072
THE STATE I THINK WE ALSO NEED

06:56:37.138 --> 06:56:39.407
TO COLLECT THESE SORTS OF DATA-

06:56:39.474 --> 06:56:40.909
THERE'S ALSO BEEN COMMENTS ABOUT

06:56:40.975 --> 06:56:43.678
HOW YOU KNOW WE NEED. TO

06:56:43.745 --> 06:56:46.214
INSTITUTE SOME SORT OF SYSTEM

06:56:46.281 --> 06:56:47.782
WORD THERE IS INFORMATION

06:56:47.849 --> 06:56:50.485
SHARING. BETWEEN SYSTEMS FOR

06:56:50.552 --> 06:56:54.022
INSTANCE THE H. C. S. AND- DOJ

06:56:54.089 --> 06:56:56.991
BUT SOME SOMETIMES- YOU KNOW I

06:56:57.058 --> 06:56:58.460
KEEP WISHING THAT THERE WAS

06:56:58.526 --> 06:56:59.861
ANOTHER SOURCE OF DATA ALL

06:56:59.928 --> 06:57:01.896
TOGETHER. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT IT

06:57:01.963 --> 06:57:03.331
THIS WAY THIS DATA THAT'S NOW

06:57:03.398 --> 06:57:05.100
REQUIRED SIMPLY PROVIDES AS A

06:57:05.166 --> 06:57:07.736
LEASE- FOR- THE DATE I'M

06:57:07.802 --> 06:57:08.770
THINKING ABOUT THAT COUNTY

06:57:08.837 --> 06:57:11.272
SUPPLIED TO DH. INTERESTS

06:57:11.339 --> 06:57:13.541
SUPPLIES SIMPLE AGGREGATE A RAW

06:57:13.608 --> 06:57:15.276
NUMBERS FOR THE NUMBERS OF

INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ON HOLDS.

06:57:17.278 --> 06:57:18.880
CHAO'S SACRAMENTO COUNTY MAY

06:57:18.947 --> 06:57:20.682

06:57:27.789 --> 06:57:29.190
YOU KNOW THAT'S INTERESTING BUT

06:57:29.257 --> 06:57:31.126
WHAT DOES IT REALLY TELL YOU. I

06:57:31.192 --> 06:57:33.194
THINK DATE BETTER DATA WOULD

06:57:33.261 --> 06:57:35.363
TELL US AT THE FRONT END. YOU

06:57:35.430 --> 06:57:36.865
KNOW HOW MANY FIFTY ONE FIFTIES

06:57:36.931 --> 06:57:38.066

06:57:38.133 --> 06:57:40.301
THERE IS A DETENTION. AND

06:57:40.368 --> 06:57:42.604

JUNIOR- CONSUMERS AND THAT. SO I

06:58:05.927 --> 06:58:09.864
THINK WE DO NEED- MORE DATA TO

06:59:55.103 --> 06:59:56.804
SITUATIONS DE ESCALATION IS

06:59:56.871 --> 06:59:58.306
SOMETHING THAT'S NEW TO THE FIRE

06:59:58.373 --> 07:00:00.141
SERVICE AND UNDERSTANDING IT.

07:00:00.208 --> 07:00:01.442
AND IF WE WANNA GET TO HAVE THIS

07:00:01.509 --> 07:00:02.343
PROBLEM WE'RE AT THE START RIGHT

07:00:02.410 --> 07:00:04.279
THERE. YOU SEE CALIFORNIA

07:00:04.345 --> 07:00:06.915
ALREADY HAS A BUSY EMS SYSTEM.

07:00:06.981 --> 07:00:08.850
ABALONES WAIT TIMES ARE ON THE

07:00:08.917 --> 07:00:11.352
RISE THIS IS IN PART TO WHAT WE

07:00:11.419 --> 07:00:13.054
CALL A POT TIMES AND THOSE

07:00:13.121 --> 07:00:14.155
PATIENT OFTENTIMES AT THE

07:00:14.222 --> 07:00:15.757
HOSPITALS WHERE PATIENTS

07:00:15.823 --> 07:00:17.825
LITERALLY ARE WAITING FOR A BED-

07:00:17.892 --> 07:00:18.927
BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER BEDS ARE

07:00:18.993 --> 07:00:20.628
FULL. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

07:00:20.695 --> 07:00:22.063
THAT PATIENT WHO CAME TO THE

07:00:22.130 --> 07:00:23.765
HOSPITAL AN AMBULANCE. IS NOW

07:00:23.831 --> 07:00:25.266
WAITING ON AMBULANCE GURNEY AND

07:00:25.333 --> 07:00:26.968
THAT AND BILLS ITSELF IS NOW

07:00:27.035 --> 07:00:28.736
STUCK AT THE HOSPITAL UNTIL

07:00:28.803 --> 07:00:30.838
CLEARED. WHAT PEOPLE ARE

07:00:30.905 --> 07:00:32.440
REALIZING IS NINE ONE ONE STILL

07:00:32.507 --> 07:00:34.642
CONTINUES ON THE BACKSIDE. OTHER

07:00:34.709 --> 07:00:36.844
PEOPLE ARE CALLING NINE ONE ONE

07:00:36.911 --> 07:00:38.313
FOR CARDIAC ARRESTS AND STROKES

07:00:38.379 --> 07:00:40.415
AND ASTHMA TYPE CALLS. AND WHAT

07:00:40.481 --> 07:00:42.317
WE SEE IS THAT THOSE PATIENTS

07:00:42.383 --> 07:00:43.985
ARE GETTING TREATED QUICKLY

07:00:44.052 --> 07:00:44.852
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

07:00:44.919 --> 07:00:46.087
AMBULANCE TO BE TRANSPORTED

07:00:46.154 --> 07:00:51.526

07:00:52.093 --> 07:00:52.660
HOSPITAL. SO THAT I DON'T THINK

07:00:52.727 --> 07:00:53.561
IT DOES IDENTIFY OFTEN. IS WHEN

07:00:53.628 --> 07:00:55.930

SHOULD BE SEEN BY A CLINICIAN OR

07:01:01.002 --> 07:01:03.638
SOME OUTPATIENT THERAPY. WE

07:01:03.705 --> 07:01:05.707
START TO ERODE AT THE

07:01:05.773 --> 07:01:07.609
FIREFIGHTERS OF MENTAL WELL

07:01:07.675 --> 07:01:08.443

YEAR AND WHAT ROLE THAT NINE

07:03:56.878 --> 07:03:57.745

THREE DIGIT NUMBER NINE EIGHT

07:04:17.298 --> 07:04:18.499
EIGHT TO ACCESS TE NATIONAL

07:04:18.566 --> 07:04:20.468
SUICIDE PREVENTION LINE. AND

THAT IS THE CHANGE THAT'S BEING

07:04:22.370 --> 07:04:25.106
USHERED IN- PURSUANT TO FEDERAL

07:04:25.173 --> 07:04:27.608
LAW NEXT YEAR- I THINK IT'S

07:04:27.675 --> 07:04:28.743
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE STATE OF

07:04:28.810 --> 07:04:30.478
CALIFORNIA WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND

CALL CENTERS. WE HAVE THIRTEEN

07:04:36.751 --> 07:04:38.152
OF THEM ACROSS THE STATE TWO OF

07:04:38.219 --> 07:04:39.353
THEM ARE RUN BY A COUNTY

07:04:39.420 --> 07:04:41.255
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND

THEY ARE PROVIDING EMOTIONAL

VOLUNTEERS AND THAT SORT OF

07:04:52.767 --> 07:04:54.735
THING SO. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

07:04:54.802 --> 07:04:55.970

TIME OF CRISIS TO HAVE AN EASY

07:05:06.848 --> 07:05:10.017
TO REMEMBER NUMBER TO DIAL. I

07:05:10.084 --> 07:05:11.786
THINK WHAT'S CHALLENGING IS THAT

07:05:11.853 --> 07:05:14.722
OFTENTIMES THAT CONVERSATION IS

07:05:14.789 --> 07:05:16.958
CONFLATED WITH AN EXPECTATION OR

07:05:17.024 --> 07:05:18.759
HOPE THAT WE ARE GOING TO

07:05:18.826 --> 07:05:22.129
SOMEHOW ALSO MAGICALLY MANIFEST

07:05:22.196 --> 07:05:26.367
A BRAND NEW. PARALLEL TO EMS AND

07:05:26.434 --> 07:05:28.369

07:05:30.037 --> 07:05:32.540
RESPONSE WHICH I WILL JUST SAY

07:05:32.607 --> 07:05:35.176
WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET WE HAVE

07:05:35.243 --> 07:05:37.912
NOT CREATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE

07:05:37.979 --> 07:05:40.748
THE STRUCTURES LIKE THE PARALLEL

07:05:40.815 --> 07:05:41.415
LIMB SO IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT

07:05:41.482 --> 07:05:44.852
TO CREATE. OR THE MOBILE CRISIS

07:05:44.919 --> 07:05:46.454
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A CONSISTENT

07:05:46.520 --> 07:05:47.555
WAY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND

07:05:47.622 --> 07:05:48.756
THIS GOES BACK TO SOME OF WHAT I

07:05:48.823 --> 07:05:51.025
WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE EARLY

07:05:51.092 --> 07:05:53.527
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING

07:05:53.594 --> 07:05:56.297
STRUCTURE. COUNTY SOME COUNTIES

07:05:56.364 --> 07:05:57.798
HAVE BEEN DOING MOBILE CRISIS

07:05:57.865 --> 07:06:00.701
FOR DECADES NOW THEY'RE VERY

07:06:00.768 --> 07:06:04.071
EXPERIENCED BUT THERE IS NO WAY

07:06:04.138 --> 07:06:05.973
FOR US TO CONSISTENTLY FUNDS

07:06:06.040 --> 07:06:07.775
THOSE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES

07:06:07.842 --> 07:06:09.443
BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A DEDICATED

07:06:09.510 --> 07:06:11.078
FUNDING STREAM IT'S NOT A-

07:06:11.145 --> 07:06:12.847
SPECIFIC BENEFIT FOR EITHER

07:06:12.914 --> 07:06:15.216
MEDICAL OR- COMMERCIALLY INSURED

07:06:15.283 --> 07:06:17.752
INDIVIDUALS. AND SO KIND OF

07:06:17.818 --> 07:06:19.153
PATCH WORKING IT TOGETHER AND

07:06:19.220 --> 07:06:20.755
THEN OTHER STAKEHOLDERS GET VERY

07:06:20.821 --> 07:06:22.423
FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY SAY WELL

07:06:22.490 --> 07:06:23.491
THERE'S ALL THIS VARIATION

07:06:23.557 --> 07:06:24.959
COUNTY EXCESSIVE THE COUNTY WHY

07:06:25.026 --> 07:06:26.928
DOESN'T AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

07:06:26.994 --> 07:06:30.498
WHEN YOU. GRANT AN ENTIRE SYSTEM

07:06:30.564 --> 07:06:31.265
WHEN YOU MAKE IT BASED ON

07:06:31.332 --> 07:06:33.701
COMPETITIVE GRANTS. OR VERY

07:06:33.768 --> 07:06:35.937
LIMITED FUNDING AND SO IF WE

07:06:36.003 --> 07:06:37.838
WANT TO CREATE THAT MOBILE

07:06:37.905 --> 07:06:39.206
CRISIS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND

07:06:39.273 --> 07:06:40.308
ESPECIALLY IF WE WANT IT

AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS

07:06:41.943 --> 07:06:43.844
REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE.

07:06:43.911 --> 07:06:45.680
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WE

07:06:45.746 --> 07:06:47.648
CAN GET THERE IF THAT'S WHAT WE

07:06:47.715 --> 07:06:48.683
CHOOSE TO DO FROM A POLICY

07:06:48.749 --> 07:06:50.351
PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THAT THE

07:06:50.418 --> 07:06:52.653
DEMAND. ADD TO THE CHIEFS

07:06:52.720 --> 07:06:55.957
POINTS. IS REALLY THERE FOR

07:06:56.023 --> 07:06:59.126
SOMETHING MORE IN THAT SPACE-

07:06:59.193 --> 07:07:01.062
YOUR STATEMENT REGARDING PARITY

07:07:01.128 --> 07:07:02.596
IS SOMETHING WE AS A STATE

07:07:02.663 --> 07:07:04.365
THOUGH SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT

07:07:04.432 --> 07:07:06.200
THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

07:07:06.267 --> 07:07:07.168
MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC

07:07:07.234 --> 07:07:09.236
EMERGENCY. AND THE NEED FOR US

07:07:09.303 --> 07:07:11.238
TO PROVIDE THOSE CRISIS SERVICES

07:07:11.305 --> 07:07:13.040
IN THOSE TIMES OF NEED IS

07:07:13.107 --> 07:07:15.509
IMPERATIVE PROCESS THE STATE SO.

07:07:15.576 --> 07:07:16.677
I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOW UP

07:07:16.744 --> 07:07:18.312
CONVERSATIONS AND ANY DATA YOU

07:07:18.379 --> 07:07:19.447
MAY HAVE FROM THOSE COUNTIES

07:07:19.513 --> 07:07:23.284
WHICH HAVE HAD PROGRAMS. UP AND

07:07:23.351 --> 07:07:23.884
RUNNING FOR A WALK THANK YOU.

07:07:23.951 --> 07:07:26.053
THANK YOU VERY. DESERVES COMMENT

07:07:26.120 --> 07:07:27.688
ON A COMPLETELY AGREED THAT WE

07:07:27.755 --> 07:07:29.757
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY

07:07:29.824 --> 07:07:32.126
RETHINK THAT SYSTEM AND SHIFT

07:07:32.193 --> 07:07:34.195
THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM. LAW

07:07:34.261 --> 07:07:38.132
ENFORCEMENT IN THE FIRE SERVICE

07:07:38.199 --> 07:07:39.700
TO EIGHT A BETTER RESPONSE BUT

07:07:39.767 --> 07:07:41.268
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEARINGS ON

07:07:41.335 --> 07:07:43.671
THE BILL AS IT WENT THROUGH LAST

07:07:43.738 --> 07:07:44.705
YEAR I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

07:07:44.772 --> 07:07:46.173
CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IT

07:07:46.240 --> 07:07:49.210
REPRESENTED. BUT IN REALITY FOR

07:07:49.276 --> 07:07:50.611
COUNTIES OF LOCAL PROVIDERS IT'S

07:07:50.678 --> 07:07:52.947
A LOT CHEAPER TO FIND

07:07:53.014 --> 07:07:55.483
APPROPRIATE RESPONSES INSTEAD OF

07:07:55.549 --> 07:07:57.151
JUST PUTTING EVERYBODY

07:07:57.218 --> 07:08:00.521
FORTUNATELY THE SAME. BRACKET

07:08:00.588 --> 07:08:02.056
WHERE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED

07:08:02.123 --> 07:08:05.259
ADEQUATE RESPOND TO CROSS THE

07:08:05.326 --> 07:08:08.262
BOARD FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

07:08:08.329 --> 07:08:10.097
SO IT IT'S IT WAS A LITTLE

07:08:10.164 --> 07:08:11.298
FRUSTRATING WATCHING

07:08:11.365 --> 07:08:13.234
CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE AND

07:08:13.300 --> 07:08:14.502
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE GOING TO END

07:08:14.568 --> 07:08:16.003
UP WHERE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ARE

07:08:16.070 --> 07:08:16.637
GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT

07:08:16.704 --> 07:08:18.539
RESPONSES UNLESS A STATE STEPS

07:08:18.606 --> 07:08:21.876
IN AND IMPROVISES STANDARD.

07:08:21.942 --> 07:08:23.778
FUNDING IN IN THE SENSE OF WHAT

07:08:23.844 --> 07:08:25.713
THOSE RESOURCES ARE SO WE HAVE

07:08:25.780 --> 07:08:27.515
AN OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US

07:08:27.581 --> 07:08:28.516
AND THERE WILL BE BUILDING GOING

07:08:28.582 --> 07:08:30.051
THROUGH THIS YEAR TO TRY AND

07:08:30.117 --> 07:08:31.085
EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

07:08:31.152 --> 07:08:32.420
BECAUSE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY

07:08:32.486 --> 07:08:33.154
THAT IS PUT ON THE TABLE TO

07:08:33.220 --> 07:08:36.157
REALLY PALTRY COMPARED TO WHAT

07:08:36.223 --> 07:08:37.191
THAT INVESTMENT COULD BE. AND

07:08:37.258 --> 07:08:40.261
THE BENEFIT IF I MAY UM CHAIR

07:08:40.327 --> 07:08:41.695
STONE I MEAN I THINK ONE THING I

07:08:41.762 --> 07:08:43.264
DO WANT TO CALL OUT BECAUSE IT

07:08:43.330 --> 07:08:46.801
IS A LEGAL ISSUE IS THAT- YOU

07:08:46.867 --> 07:08:49.470
KNOW WE ARE REQUIRED IN TERMS

07:08:49.537 --> 07:08:51.605
OF- HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY

07:08:51.672 --> 07:08:52.773
DEPARTMENTS DOCTORS SELLERS

07:08:52.840 --> 07:08:54.442
SPOKE TO THIS HOSPITALS ARE

07:08:54.508 --> 07:08:56.477
REQUIRED TO TAKE PSYCHIATRIC

07:08:56.544 --> 07:08:58.712
EMERGENCIES THERE IS UNDER THE

07:08:58.779 --> 07:09:01.048
LAW FEDERALLY AND STATE LAW NO

07:09:01.115 --> 07:09:02.216
DISTINCTION DR ARAMBULA JUST

07:09:02.283 --> 07:09:04.418
MENTION THAT. AND SO I DO THINK

07:09:04.485 --> 07:09:05.953
THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL

07:09:06.020 --> 07:09:08.122
BECAUSE CERTAIN PHYSICAL HEALTH

07:09:08.189 --> 07:09:10.858
CONDITIONS AND THE PHYSICIANS IN

07:09:10.925 --> 07:09:11.392
THE ROOM CAN SPEAK TO THIS

07:09:11.459 --> 07:09:14.728
BETTER THAN I CAN ME UP HERE

07:09:14.795 --> 07:09:16.630
INITIALLY TO BE A PSYCHIATRIC

07:09:16.697 --> 07:09:20.334
EMERGENCY OR OR SITUATION BUT

07:09:20.401 --> 07:09:21.702
THEY MAY ACTUALLY BE A PHYSICAL

07:09:21.769 --> 07:09:24.605
HEALTH NEED THAT THAT HAS TO BE

07:09:24.672 --> 07:09:26.607
REVIEWED BY A AND M. D. AND

07:09:26.674 --> 07:09:27.675
THAT'S WHY OUR EMERGENCY

07:09:27.741 --> 07:09:28.909
DEPARTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY A

07:09:28.976 --> 07:09:31.846
REALLY IMPORTANT BACKSTOP AND WE

07:09:31.912 --> 07:09:35.449
CANNOT. ENTIRELY DIVORCE WHAT IS

07:09:35.516 --> 07:09:37.651
WHAT IS OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH

07:09:37.718 --> 07:09:39.587
SYSTEM SO TO SPEAK AND OUR

07:09:39.653 --> 07:09:41.489
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WE NEED

07:09:41.555 --> 07:09:43.891
MORE SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS WE

07:09:43.958 --> 07:09:45.726
NEED MORE SPECIALIZATION IN

07:09:45.793 --> 07:09:47.595
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSIDE OUR

07:09:47.661 --> 07:09:50.631
HOSPITALS INSIDE OF OUR EMS

07:09:50.698 --> 07:09:52.933
SYSTEMS INSIDE OF OUR STATE

07:09:53.000 --> 07:09:56.070
FRANKLY BUT WE ALSO. DO NEED TO

07:09:56.137 --> 07:09:57.738
BUILD OUT MORE SPECIALIZATION

07:09:57.805 --> 07:10:00.007
BOTH WITHIN OUR PUBLIC DELIVERY

07:10:00.074 --> 07:10:02.042
SYSTEM FROM MEDICAL MANAGED CARE

07:10:02.109 --> 07:10:04.011
THROUGH TO MOVE FAR MORE

07:10:04.078 --> 07:10:05.546
SERVICES AND OUR SPECIAL TEAMS

07:10:05.613 --> 07:10:06.814
SAFETYNET AND THEN IN THE

07:10:06.881 --> 07:10:08.749
COMMERCIAL SIDE AS WELL SO I

07:10:08.816 --> 07:10:10.484
THINK THAT THE BIGGEST MESSAGE

07:10:10.551 --> 07:10:13.320
HERE IS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE

07:10:13.387 --> 07:10:15.322
A PART OF THIS AND EVERYBODY'S

07:10:15.389 --> 07:10:16.924
GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT

07:10:16.991 --> 07:10:19.994
KIND OF EDUCATION THAT THE-

07:10:20.060 --> 07:10:21.061
CHIEF WAS TALKING ABOUT. CORRECT

07:10:21.128 --> 07:10:22.730
AND I WAS REALLY TALKING TO THE

07:10:22.796 --> 07:10:25.366
INITIAL CONTACT BECAUSE WE DON'T

07:10:25.432 --> 07:10:27.568
HAVE WITH SOMEBODY'S IN CRISIS

07:10:27.635 --> 07:10:28.202
AND THEY CALL THE POLICE SO THEY

07:10:28.269 --> 07:10:30.604
CALLEDTHE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO

07:10:30.671 --> 07:10:31.205
ARE MORE USED TO DEALING WITH

07:10:31.272 --> 07:10:33.741
PHYSICAL. ALMONDS THE IN THE

07:10:33.807 --> 07:10:34.842
HOSPITAL SHOULD NOT BE

07:10:34.909 --> 07:10:36.310
DISTINGUISHING AND SHOULD BE

07:10:36.377 --> 07:10:38.012
ADEQUATELY TRAINED FOR BOTH

07:10:38.078 --> 07:10:39.713
PHYSICAL MENTAL THERE SHOULD BE

07:10:39.780 --> 07:10:40.681
THAT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE

07:10:40.748 --> 07:10:43.851
HAVE. BUT IF WE HAD. A BETTER

07:10:43.918 --> 07:10:46.253
WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS IN. AN

07:10:46.320 --> 07:10:48.956
EMOTIONAL OR MENTAL CRISIS. TO

07:10:49.023 --> 07:10:51.158
THEN GET INTO THAT SYSTEM THAT'S

07:10:51.225 --> 07:10:52.293
REALLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT

07:10:52.359 --> 07:10:54.028
THAT THAT THAT ENTRY SO THAT

07:10:54.094 --> 07:10:55.563
THERE ARE. LIKE FIREFIGHTERS WHO

07:10:55.629 --> 07:11:00.100
WERE TRAINED.FOR FIRES IN FOR

07:11:00.167 --> 07:11:00.901
CERTAIN TYPES OF MEDICAL

07:11:00.968 --> 07:11:02.403
EMERGENCIES HAVING AN

07:11:02.469 --> 07:11:04.238
APPROPRIATE PERSON ON THE OTHER

07:11:04.305 --> 07:11:05.906
END OF THAT LINE TO FIGURE OUT

07:11:05.973 --> 07:11:07.741
WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND

07:11:07.808 --> 07:11:09.043

07:14:17.264 --> 07:14:20.534
KNOW IS LPS. AND THE BULK OF THE

07:14:20.601 --> 07:14:23.070
DISCUSSION I SUPPOSE WILL BE ON

07:14:23.137 --> 07:14:24.738
WHETHER AND HOW TO TREAT

07:14:24.805 --> 07:14:26.974
INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT STANDARDS

07:14:27.040 --> 07:14:29.476
IT'S AN IMPORTANT AND LEGITIMATE

07:14:29.543 --> 07:14:31.311
DISCUSSION OF COURSE. I DON'T

07:14:31.378 --> 07:14:33.080
BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

07:14:33.147 --> 07:14:34.848
SHOULD UPDATE THE DEFINITION OF

07:14:34.915 --> 07:14:37.851
RAPE THE BILL YOU TO CONFORM. TO

07:14:37.918 --> 07:14:39.753
BOTH THE REALITIES AND THE

07:14:39.820 --> 07:14:42.523
EXTENT OF THE HOMELESS CRISIS.

07:14:42.589 --> 07:14:45.192
AND TO CONFORM TO JUST PLAIN

07:14:45.259 --> 07:14:46.960
COMMON SENSE I KNOW YOU WILL

07:14:47.027 --> 07:14:48.162
HEAR IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY FOR

07:14:48.228 --> 07:14:50.998
DOC. SHARE IN THE L. A. COUNTY

07:14:51.064 --> 07:14:51.698
MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR WHO I

07:14:51.765 --> 07:14:54.568
THINK IS- DOES A VERY IMPORTANT

07:14:54.635 --> 07:14:56.503
THINKING. ON REDEFINING GRAVE

07:14:56.570 --> 07:15:01.074
DISABILITY TO ENSURE THAT IT

07:15:01.141 --> 07:15:03.710
FIND NOT JUST IN A MOMENT'S TIME

07:15:03.777 --> 07:15:05.579
WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MAY BE

07:15:05.646 --> 07:15:07.247
SUFFERING FROM STE YOUR MENTAL

07:15:07.314 --> 07:15:08.916
HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH

07:15:08.982 --> 07:15:11.084
ISSUES CAN PRESENT THEMSELVES IN

07:15:11.151 --> 07:15:12.586
A WAY TO SAY THAT THEY'RE

07:15:12.653 --> 07:15:15.255
GREATLY DISABLED IT NEEDS TO BE

07:15:15.322 --> 07:15:18.225
A DEFINITION THAT ACTUALLY

07:15:18.292 --> 07:15:20.260
CONFORMS TO. I SITUATION OF

07:15:20.327 --> 07:15:22.729
THEIR LIVING OUTDOORS SIX

07:15:22.796 --> 07:15:24.898
BASICALLY AND MENTALLY AND IT'S

07:15:24.965 --> 07:15:26.867
BEEN OUT THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

07:15:26.934 --> 07:15:27.935
THE DEFINITION OF GREAT

07:15:28.001 --> 07:15:32.506
DISABILITY SHOULD ALLOW ABOUT US

07:15:32.573 --> 07:15:33.674
AS A SOCIETY BE ABLE TO HELP

07:15:33.740 --> 07:15:36.410
THEM VOLUNTARILY YES FIRST BUT

07:15:36.477 --> 07:15:39.079
IT'S NOT TO SAY EVERY UP. IN

07:15:39.146 --> 07:15:41.215
WHAT WAY BECAUSE LIVING ON THE

07:15:41.281 --> 07:15:43.250
STREETS IS PLAYING AN ACCEPTABLE

07:15:43.317 --> 07:15:45.252
IN THE CURRENT DEFINITION. AND

07:15:45.319 --> 07:15:46.753
AT LEAST ITS INTERPRETATION DOES

07:15:46.820 --> 07:15:49.656
NOT CONFORM TO THE REALITY IN MY

07:15:49.723 --> 07:15:51.258
VIEW OF THE SUFFERING OUT THERE

07:15:51.325 --> 07:15:52.626
BUT I WOULD USE THE REMAINDER OF

07:15:52.693 --> 07:15:54.661
MY TIME IF I'VE GOT TWO OR THREE

07:15:54.728 --> 07:15:58.398
MINUTES LEFT. THE FLIP THE

07:15:58.465 --> 07:15:59.500
CONVERSATION ON ITS HEAD. AS YOU

07:15:59.566 --> 07:16:06.807
KNOW- A LEGAL RIGHT TO HOUSING.

07:16:06.874 --> 07:16:08.208
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT A LEGAL

07:16:08.275 --> 07:16:11.278
RIGHT TO HOUSING. WOULD FORCE

07:16:11.345 --> 07:16:14.114
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS.

07:16:14.181 --> 07:16:16.116
TO BUILD MORE TO PRODUCE MORE

07:16:16.183 --> 07:16:18.919
SHELTER TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSE.

07:16:18.986 --> 07:16:20.888
IN A WAY THAT WOULD BETTER MEET

07:16:20.954 --> 07:16:23.524
THE NEEDS THE LAW CURRENTLY SAYS

07:16:23.590 --> 07:16:27.394
THAT NO CITY NO COUNTY. NOR THE

07:16:27.461 --> 07:16:29.663
STATE DESPITE THE LEADERSHIP THE

07:16:29.730 --> 07:16:31.164
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE PUT

07:16:31.231 --> 07:16:33.033
MORE MONEY THAN EVER AN EASY

07:16:33.100 --> 07:16:34.701
ISSUES WE ARE NOT REQUIRED. HE

07:16:34.768 --> 07:16:37.905
SAID. AND ALL OF THE OBSTACLES

07:16:37.971 --> 07:16:39.806
WHETHER IT BE ISM EXCESSIVE

07:16:39.873 --> 07:16:42.643
LOCAL CONTROL OVER REGULATION.

07:16:42.709 --> 07:16:44.411
EXCESSIVE COST LACK OF HOUSING

07:16:44.478 --> 07:16:48.415
INNOVATION ALL ARE MORE POWERFUL

07:16:48.482 --> 07:16:50.851
. THEN THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO

07:16:50.918 --> 07:16:51.952
BUILD MORE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

07:16:52.019 --> 07:16:55.422
LEGAL OBLIGATION THAT CAN HELP.

07:16:55.489 --> 07:16:57.791
THOSE OBSTACLES SOME CRITICS

07:16:57.858 --> 07:17:00.027
MADE THAT FOR MANY OUT ON THE

07:17:00.093 --> 07:17:02.996
STREET. L. ELLIS HOUSING ISN'T

07:17:03.063 --> 07:17:04.631
HE ISSUE MENTAL HEALTH IS ALL

07:17:04.698 --> 07:17:08.835
RIGHT- THE CITY MAYOR HOUSING IS

07:17:08.902 --> 07:17:10.504
THE BEST PROXY I HAVE FOR

07:17:10.571 --> 07:17:11.605
HELPING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

ISSUES ARE OUT ON THE STREET

07:17:15.142 --> 07:17:16.777
BECAUSE- CITIES DON'T. PROVIDE

07:17:16.843 --> 07:17:18.779
MENTAL HEALTH CARE. IT'S A THIS

07:17:18.845 --> 07:17:20.314
IS THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE

07:17:20.380 --> 07:17:21.782
TO YOU AND THEN I WILL. TURN IT

07:17:21.848 --> 07:17:24.418

PAID TO THE ORIGINAL STATE.

07:17:33.126 --> 07:17:35.262
DECISION MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE

07:17:35.329 --> 07:17:37.965
WHEN IT PASSED THE L. P. S. ACT

07:17:38.031 --> 07:17:40.167

07:17:40.233 --> 07:17:41.835

LATER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN

07:17:44.871 --> 07:17:45.405
THE LETTERMAN ACT OF COURSE

07:17:56.450 --> 07:18:00.287
THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

07:18:00.354 --> 07:18:02.556

07:29:40.286 --> 07:29:43.623

THAT IN MY KNOWLEDGE IT IS

07:41:20.085 --> 07:41:21.820
ALWAYS BETTER TO BE PREVENTIVE.

07:41:21.887 --> 07:41:23.555
AND IN A RECOGNIZABLE TRYING TO

07:41:23.622 --> 07:41:25.858

SOME COMMUNITIES YOU NOW HAVE A

07:41:27.893 --> 07:41:29.695
SITUATION WHERE THE WHERE THE

07:41:29.762 --> 07:41:31.530
PROBLEMS- HAVE GOTTEN SO BIG

07:41:31.597 --> 07:41:33.098
LIKE THE DISTRICT THAT I HAVE

07:41:33.165 --> 07:41:36.035
THE HONOR OF REPRESENTING. THAT

07:41:36.101 --> 07:41:36.468
HISTORICALLY HAS HAD

07:41:36.535 --> 07:41:40.105
POPULATIONS- WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT

07:41:40.172 --> 07:41:41.974
BEHIND. IN THE POLLS RIGHT TO

07:41:42.041 --> 07:41:44.810
THE PLACE. THERE ARE SEVERE

07:41:44.877 --> 07:41:46.345
MENTAL HEALTH CARE ISSUES WHERE

07:41:46.412 --> 07:41:48.847
THERE ARE- SUBSTANCE ABUSE

07:41:48.914 --> 07:41:52.618
ISSUES WERE. TRAUMA ISSUES AND

07:41:52.684 --> 07:41:54.386
JUST LAYERS AND LAYERS COMPILED

07:41:54.453 --> 07:41:56.789
IT BUT WE'VE I WOULD STILL ARGUE

07:41:56.855 --> 07:41:58.857
THAT THERE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED

07:41:58.924 --> 07:42:02.961
TO HAPPEN- SO THAT WE ARE

07:42:03.028 --> 07:42:04.530
BRINGING THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE

07:42:04.596 --> 07:42:07.533
IT'S MORE HUMANE TO HELP PEOPLE

07:42:07.599 --> 07:42:09.635
WHO ARE AT THAT STAGE. THEN TO

07:42:09.701 --> 07:42:14.206
ALLOW THEM. GEN DO NOT GIVE THEM

07:42:14.273 --> 07:42:16.275
THE ACCESS TO THIS TO THE HELP

07:42:16.341 --> 07:42:18.043
THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE AS

07:42:18.110 --> 07:42:20.079
HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT'S WHY

07:42:20.145 --> 07:42:21.447
STRUGGLE IN IT I DON'T DISAGREE

07:42:21.513 --> 07:42:23.515
ON A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT IT

07:42:23.582 --> 07:42:25.984

OVER THE YEARS. ON THESE ISSUES

07:42:29.188 --> 07:42:30.689
AND SPECIALLY PURPLE CHAIRS FOR

07:42:30.756 --> 07:42:31.356
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND IT IS

07:42:31.423 --> 07:42:34.626
AN EMOTIONAL ISSUE. AND I'M

07:42:34.693 --> 07:42:35.227
SECURE I'M GOING A LITTLE BIT

07:42:35.294 --> 07:42:37.196
LONG ON THIS BUT I. BUT I STILL

07:42:37.262 --> 07:42:40.265
STRUGGLE AND PUSH GENTLY TO ASK

07:42:40.332 --> 07:42:41.500
BUT WHAT WOULD WE DO IF WE

07:42:41.567 --> 07:42:42.334
REALLY WANTED TO IMPROVE IT

07:42:42.401 --> 07:42:44.136
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT. A LOT OF

07:42:44.203 --> 07:42:48.273
FOLKS. FOR HER ON THE STREET.

07:42:48.340 --> 07:42:50.676
WHO MAY NOT BE IN THE SITUATION

07:42:50.742 --> 07:42:51.777
WHERE THEY CAN ASK FOR HELP

07:42:51.844 --> 07:42:54.613
THEMSELVES AT THAT MOMENT BUT WE

07:42:54.680 --> 07:42:56.582
KNOW IF THEY'RE IN GRAVE. IN

07:42:56.648 --> 07:42:58.984
DESPERATE NEED OF IT AND THAT'S

07:42:59.051 --> 07:43:01.920
WHY STRUGGLE IN LET. THIRTY

07:43:01.987 --> 07:43:04.356
PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE YEAH

07:43:04.423 --> 07:43:06.959
IT'S A VERY SMALL POPULATION I

07:43:07.025 --> 07:43:07.593
WOULD ARGUE COMPARED TO WHAT WE

07:43:07.659 --> 07:43:10.095
SEE. IS THAT NEED OUT THERE AND

07:43:10.162 --> 07:43:11.797
A LITTLE SKID ROW FOR EXAMPLE

07:43:11.864 --> 07:43:13.398
AND NOT ALL POPULATIONS WILL FIT

07:43:13.465 --> 07:43:17.503
IN THAT PARTICULAR- DISAPPEARED

07:43:17.569 --> 07:43:18.103

PERSON. AND I USE ROUNDED NUMBER

07:43:19.905 --> 07:43:22.174
SO FOR THOSE WHO FACT CHECK ALL

07:43:22.241 --> 07:43:22.774
THAT WE SAY WE'RE USING RANDOM

07:43:22.841 --> 07:43:24.743
NUMBERS. BUT YOU GOT A LITTLE

07:43:24.810 --> 07:43:26.478
SHY OF FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN A

07:43:26.545 --> 07:43:28.413
FEW SQUARE BLOCKS AND IF YOU

07:43:28.480 --> 07:43:29.047

07:43:29.114 --> 07:43:33.051
THERE. YES I WOULD ALMOST DETER

07:43:33.118 --> 07:43:34.553
SOMEBODY TO ARGUE THAT IS MORE

07:43:34.620 --> 07:43:35.954
HUMANE TO LEAVE SOMEBODY ON THE

07:43:36.021 --> 07:43:37.723
STREET AND IT WOULD BE TO BRING

07:43:37.789 --> 07:43:38.357
A MAN TO GET THEM THE HELP THAT

07:44:37.950 --> 07:44:41.687
HOMELESS. I CAN'T IMAGINE- THAT

07:44:41.753 --> 07:44:44.790
WE CAN FIND LARGE PERCENTAGES OF

07:44:44.856 --> 07:44:46.325
PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE CATEGORIES

07:44:46.391 --> 07:44:49.061
WITHIN THAT POPULATION THERE'S-

07:44:49.127 --> 07:44:53.532

TO THAT IN LEAVING AND I'M ON

07:44:54.466 --> 07:44:56.168
THE STREETS FOR THE SAKE OF

07:44:56.235 --> 07:44:58.704
PROTECTING A STAT A STATUS QUO

07:44:58.770 --> 07:45:00.739

07:45:02.608 --> 07:45:03.842
GOOD MAYBE HE'LL TELL ME WHAT

07:45:03.909 --> 07:45:07.012
YOU THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT WENEED TO CHANGE TO ACTUALLY DO

07:45:07.079 --> 07:45:10.115
THAT OR TO HELP PEOPLE- IF WE

07:45:10.182 --> 07:45:13.485
HAD TO CHANGE THINGS- WITHIN

07:45:13.552 --> 07:45:15.687
OUR- LITTLE LETTERMAN ACTIVE

07:45:15.754 --> 07:45:17.289
LPO. I MEAN WE GOT LAYERS AND

07:45:17.356 --> 07:45:19.725
LAYERS OF THINGS. YOU KNOW THE

07:45:19.791 --> 07:45:22.694
IN LAURA'S LAW WE- WILL BE GONE

07:45:22.761 --> 07:45:23.328
FOREVER ON THE DIFFERENT LAYERS

07:45:23.395 --> 07:45:24.930
A LAW THAT ARE MEANT TO. AND

07:45:24.997 --> 07:45:25.864
PROGRAMS ARE MEANT TO HELP

07:45:25.931 --> 07:45:27.966
PEOPLE BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT

07:45:28.033 --> 07:45:28.900
ANYBODY WOULD ARGUE THAT PEOPLE

07:45:28.967 --> 07:45:30.769
AREN'T. GOING AND GOING BY THE

07:45:30.836 --> 07:45:34.506
LARGEST NUMBERS ON THE STREET

07:45:34.573 --> 07:45:36.174
AND THEY NEED DESPERATE HELP. I

07:45:36.241 --> 07:45:39.945
KNOW THAT L. A. COUNTY HAS. SIX

07:45:40.012 --> 07:45:41.446
ASSET WITH WORKING WITH PEOPLE

07:45:41.513 --> 07:45:42.914
THAT ARE ON THE STREETS AND

07:45:42.981 --> 07:45:46.285
LOOKING AT THEM- AT CONSERVING

07:45:46.351 --> 07:45:47.185
THEM BUT STRAIGHT FROM THE

07:45:47.252 --> 07:45:49.421
STREET BECAUSE THEN IT HAS BEEN

07:45:49.488 --> 07:45:51.223
TOO DIFFICULT TO TRY TO GET THEM

07:45:51.290 --> 07:45:53.425
INTO A TREATMENT CENTER BECAUSE

07:45:53.492 --> 07:45:55.894
OF. THEIR UNWILLING TO GO TO

07:45:55.961 --> 07:45:57.162
THAT LENGTH TO GET THEIR

07:45:57.229 --> 07:45:59.197
TREATMENT AND THEY'RE REFUSING

07:45:59.264 --> 07:46:00.365
TREATMENT SO THEY START WITH

07:46:00.432 --> 07:46:01.767
THEM ON THE STREET AND THEY'VE

07:46:01.833 --> 07:46:03.635
BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. THAT

07:46:03.702 --> 07:46:06.104
PROGRAM ALTHOUGH VERY SUCCESSFUL

07:46:06.171 --> 07:46:09.241
IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE

07:46:09.308 --> 07:46:10.375
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A TEAM

07:46:10.442 --> 07:46:12.010
APPROACH THEY'VE GOT A

07:46:12.077 --> 07:46:13.879
PSYCHIATRIST A SOCIAL WORKER A

07:46:13.945 --> 07:46:15.814
PUBLIC GUARDIAN CONSERVATOR

07:46:15.881 --> 07:46:18.350
DEPUTY AND I THINK ONE OTHER

07:46:18.417 --> 07:46:20.652
MAYBE A NURSE OF SOME KIND THAT

07:46:20.719 --> 07:46:22.788
TEAM GOES OUT. TO SEE THOSE

07:46:22.854 --> 07:46:24.389
INDIVIDUALS ON THE STREETS AND

07:46:24.456 --> 07:46:26.992
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IT'S A WHOLE

07:46:27.059 --> 07:46:29.394
PERSON APPROACH. BUT IT'S A VERY

07:46:29.461 --> 07:46:31.596
EXPENSIVE PROGRAM AND THERE THE

07:46:31.663 --> 07:46:33.031
ONLY COUNTY THAT HAS HAD THE

07:46:33.098 --> 07:46:35.734
RESOURCE NINETY TWO AND NINETY.

07:46:35.801 --> 07:46:40.005
YEAH YES IT IN SO. THOSE KINDS

07:46:40.072 --> 07:46:42.140
OF WHOLE PERSON APPROACHES HAVE

07:46:42.207 --> 07:46:44.042
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THEY'RE

07:46:44.109 --> 07:46:46.044
VERY SUCCESSFUL IF YOU'RE

07:46:46.111 --> 07:46:48.046
WILLING TO SUPPORT THEM BUT

07:46:48.113 --> 07:46:50.115
THERE ARE TO DO THAT STATE WHY

07:46:50.182 --> 07:46:53.185
WOULD BE- I CAN'T EVEN CALCULATE

07:46:53.251 --> 07:46:54.686
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO CALCULATE

07:46:54.753 --> 07:46:57.456
THE COST OF THAT TO DO THAT ST

07:46:57.522 --> 07:47:00.092
WORK FOR SOMEONE TO GET

07:47:00.158 --> 07:47:02.594
CONCERNED BECAUSE IT'S SO. IT

07:47:02.661 --> 07:47:04.396
DOES TAKE A TEAM APPROACH AND

07:47:04.463 --> 07:47:07.366
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS

07:47:07.432 --> 07:47:07.966
TO GET THAT KIND OF SYSTEM IN

07:47:08.033 --> 07:47:11.370
PLACE. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THAT'S

07:47:11.436 --> 07:47:12.871
ONE ONE PROCESS THAT IS

07:47:12.938 --> 07:47:15.807
CURRENTLY VERY SUCCESSFUL. ALL

07:47:15.874 --> 07:47:19.344
THE OTHER COUNTIES. I HAVE TO BE

07:47:19.411 --> 07:47:20.579
HONEST WITH YOU THEY ARE

07:47:20.645 --> 07:47:22.047
STRUGGLING JUST TO DEAL WITH

07:47:22.114 --> 07:47:22.948
WHAT THAT WHAT THEY'VE GOT ON

07:47:23.014 --> 07:47:24.416
THEIR PLATE BECAUSE WE DON'T

07:47:24.483 --> 07:47:26.852
CONTROL THE FRONT DOOR WE DON'T

07:47:26.918 --> 07:47:29.755
CONTROL- AND BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

07:47:29.821 --> 07:47:31.990
ANY DEDICATED STATE FUNDING

07:47:32.057 --> 07:47:33.225
THERE'S ONLY THE COUNTY GENERAL

07:47:33.291 --> 07:47:34.960
FUND AND WHAT LITTLE BIT OF

07:47:35.026 --> 07:47:36.795
MONEY THE COUNTIES CAN COLLECT

07:47:36.862 --> 07:47:38.897
IN FEES BUT BECAUSE WE DEAL WITH

07:47:38.964 --> 07:47:40.899
THE INDIGENT POPULATION. EVEN

07:47:40.966 --> 07:47:42.868
THOUGH THE COURT AWARDS ARE FEES

07:47:42.934 --> 07:47:44.703

COULDN'T COLLECT THOSE FEES SO

07:47:57.115 --> 07:47:59.451

THAT IS VERY COMMON BUT NOT

07:59:46.290 --> 07:59:48.092
EVERYBODY WHO HAS THE DIAGNOSIS

07:59:48.159 --> 07:59:50.094
IS OPEN ABOUT IT. AND I JUST

07:59:50.161 --> 07:59:52.063
THINK- JUST TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

PEOPLE CAN END UP IN A FIFTY ONE

07:59:53.831 --> 07:59:56.667
FIFTIES SITUATION. WHEN YOU LOOK

AT THEM YOU WOULD THINK THAT

07:59:57.935 --> 07:59:59.604
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM.

07:59:59.670 --> 08:00:00.771
SO IT'S JUST A IT'S A BIG

08:00:00.838 --> 08:00:02.039
POPULATION IT'S A DIVERSE

08:00:02.106 --> 08:00:03.808
POPULATION. AND IF THE ONLY

08:00:03.875 --> 08:00:05.343
PEOPLE YOU THINK ABOUT ANYTHING

08:00:05.409 --> 08:00:06.844
ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS OR PEOPLE

08:00:06.911 --> 08:00:08.813
LIVING ON THE STREET. YOU'RE NOT

08:00:08.880 --> 08:00:14.652
SEEING HIM AT ALL THE. THE FULL

08:00:14.719 --> 08:00:15.219
SPECTRUM OF THE POPULATION-

08:00:15.286 --> 08:00:16.654
ANOTHER POINTWE MADE IN OUR

08:00:16.721 --> 08:00:18.589
TEST. IS THE PURPOSE OF THE

08:00:18.656 --> 08:00:20.892
LETTERMAN PATRIS SHORT ACT. IS

08:00:20.958 --> 08:00:23.528
N. THE INAPPROPRIATE INDEFINITE

08:00:23.594 --> 08:00:25.062
AN INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT OF

08:00:25.129 --> 08:00:26.998
PERSONS WITH MENTAL HEALTH

08:00:27.064 --> 08:00:28.866
DISORDERS THAT'S THE PURPOSE.

08:00:28.933 --> 08:00:30.868
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT CERTAIN TO

08:00:30.935 --> 08:00:33.204
MAKE IT EASIER TO TAKE AWAY

08:00:33.271 --> 08:00:34.805
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS IS NOT GOING TO

08:00:34.872 --> 08:00:36.040
ACHIEVE THAT PURPOSE WE SHOULD

08:00:36.107 --> 08:00:37.842
MAKE IT HARDER TO TAKE AWAY

08:00:37.909 --> 08:00:39.143
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS AND LET ME JUST

08:00:39.210 --> 08:00:40.545
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE IN THIS

08:00:40.611 --> 08:00:42.547
STATE RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE GO TO AN

08:00:42.613 --> 08:00:45.116
EMERGENCY ROOM VOLUNTARILY

08:00:45.183 --> 08:00:46.584
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN CRISIS AND

08:00:46.651 --> 08:00:48.553
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET HELP. AND

08:00:48.619 --> 08:00:50.788
THEY GET PUT ON A FIFTY ONE

08:00:50.855 --> 08:00:51.689
FIFTY EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE ASKING

08:00:51.756 --> 08:00:53.591
FOR HELP WHY ARE WE TAKING AWAY

08:00:53.658 --> 08:00:55.259
THEIR LIBERTY WHEN ALL THEY NEED

08:00:55.326 --> 08:00:57.628
IS GOOD CARE. SO I THINK IF

08:00:57.695 --> 08:01:00.064
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT LPS REFORM

08:01:00.131 --> 08:01:01.732
DON'T START WITH THE IDEA THAT

08:01:01.799 --> 08:01:03.367
WE NEED MORE POWER TO TAKE AWAY

08:01:03.434 --> 08:01:05.203
RIGHTS START WITH THE IDEA THAT

08:01:05.269 --> 08:01:08.172
THIS EXISTS TO PROTECT PEOPLE

08:01:08.239 --> 08:01:08.773
FROM HAVING THEIR RIGHTS TAKEN

08:01:08.839 --> 08:01:11.342
AWAY- THE NEXT ONE I WANTED TO

08:01:11.409 --> 08:01:13.544
MAKE. IS WE NEED TO IMPROVE

08:01:13.611 --> 08:01:14.779
TRUTH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

08:01:14.845 --> 08:01:16.414
CONSISTENCY ON THIS ACROSS ALL

08:01:16.480 --> 08:01:18.182
YOUR WITNESSES. WE NEED TO

08:01:18.249 --> 08:01:20.585
IMPROVE TREATMENT FOR ALL PEOPLE

08:01:20.651 --> 08:01:22.453
WHO ARE DETAINED ON LPS HOLDS

08:01:22.520 --> 08:01:24.689
AND CONSERVATORSHIP. THE FACT

08:01:24.755 --> 08:01:25.756
THAT YOU'RE GETTING DETAINED

08:01:25.823 --> 08:01:27.358
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE GETTING

08:01:27.425 --> 08:01:29.293
GOOD MENTL HEALTH TREATMENT-

08:01:29.360 --> 08:01:30.428
AND IT AND IT'S ESPECIALLY

08:01:30.494 --> 08:01:33.097
IMPORTANT TO EXPRESSLY REQUIRE.

08:01:33.164 --> 08:01:35.333
EFFECTIVE TRANSITION PLANNING

08:01:35.399 --> 08:01:37.368
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RELEASED FROM

08:01:37.435 --> 08:01:39.670
BOTH SHORT TERM LPS SOLD. AND

08:01:39.737 --> 08:01:42.340
LONG TERM LPS CONSERVATORSHIP.

08:01:42.406 --> 08:01:43.841
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW

08:01:43.908 --> 08:01:45.376
AND IF WE MAKE THIS TREATMENT

08:01:45.443 --> 08:01:47.578
DURING THE TRANSITION. VOLUNTARY

08:01:47.645 --> 08:01:49.480
PERSON CENTERED AND CULTURALLY

08:01:49.547 --> 08:01:51.249
AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE.

08:01:51.315 --> 08:01:53.818
WE'RE GONNA SET SOMEBODY UP FOR

08:01:53.884 --> 08:01:55.353
SUCCESS OVER THE LONG TERM. THE

08:01:55.419 --> 08:01:56.821
THIRD POINT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD

08:01:56.887 --> 08:01:58.856
FROM MANY WITNESSES TODAY AS WE

08:01:58.923 --> 08:02:00.891
NEED BETTER DATA AND WE NEED THE

08:02:00.958 --> 08:02:02.360
DATA TO BE DISAGGREGATED BY

08:02:02.426 --> 08:02:04.295
RACE. ETHNICITY AND OTHER

08:02:04.362 --> 08:02:05.930
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS SO

08:02:05.997 --> 08:02:06.764
WE KNOW WHAT'S ACTUALLY

08:02:06.831 --> 08:02:09.000
HAPPENING. SO FINALLY JUST IN

08:02:09.066 --> 08:02:11.535
TERMS OF MY STORY- THIRTY TWO

08:02:11.602 --> 08:02:13.871
YEARS OF AGO I WAS A STUDENT AT

08:02:13.938 --> 08:02:16.107
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. AND I WENT

08:02:16.173 --> 08:02:18.175
VERY QUICKLY FROM BEING HAPPY

08:02:18.242 --> 08:02:19.744
TALKING A LOT IN CLASS I HAD

08:02:19.810 --> 08:02:21.579
RECENTLY GOTTEN MARRIED. TO

HAVING NO ENERGY NO SELF

08:02:23.080 --> 08:02:24.782
CONFIDENCE HAVING TROUBLE

08:02:24.849 --> 08:02:25.883
GETTING OUT OF BED VERY

08:02:25.950 --> 08:02:27.418
DIFFICULT FIGURE OUT THAT I

08:02:27.485 --> 08:02:29.420
COULD HAVE A CAREER AS A LAWYER.

08:02:29.487 --> 08:02:30.988
AND IT WAS THE SCARIEST THING

08:02:31.055 --> 08:02:32.056
I'VE EVER BEEN THROUGH IN MY

08:02:32.123 --> 08:02:33.924
LIFE. I GOT MARRIED THE SUMMER

BEFORE MY WIFE HELPED ME STAY ON

08:02:36.827 --> 08:02:38.529
THE CONVEYOR BELT THAT I WAS ON

08:02:38.596 --> 08:02:40.765
I STAYED IN SCHOOL I GRADUATED I

08:02:40.831 --> 08:02:42.433

08:02:47.538 --> 08:02:49.473
ABLE TO HAVE A CAREER. AS A

08:02:49.540 --> 08:02:51.108

08:02:51.175 --> 08:02:52.977
SUCCESSFUL CAREER. MY WIFE AND I

RAISED TWO CHILDREN YOU KNOW

08:02:55.446 --> 08:02:56.080
WE'VE WE'VE HAD GOOD LIVES

08:02:56.147 --> 08:02:58.482
TOGETHER. THE MOST IMPORTANT

08:02:58.549 --> 08:03:01.085
THING FOR ME WAS STAYING ON THE

08:03:01.152 --> 08:03:02.953
CONVEYOR BELT AND IF I HAD GONE

08:03:03.020 --> 08:03:04.989

WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR

08:03:09.660 --> 08:03:10.995
MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEN COME

08:03:11.062 --> 08:03:12.063
BACK TO US WHEN YOU'RE FEELING

08:03:12.129 --> 08:03:13.531
BETTER. I MIGHT HAVE BEEN

08:03:13.597 --> 08:03:14.799
KNOCKED OFF THE CONVEYOR BELT

08:03:14.865 --> 08:03:19.136
AND NEVER GOT BACK ON SO I JUST

08:03:19.203 --> 08:03:19.704
ENCOURAGE YOU WHEN YOU THINK

08:03:19.770 --> 08:03:20.338
ABOUT THE SYSTEM. DO EVERYTHING

08:03:20.404 --> 08:03:21.405
YOU CAN TO KEEP PEOPLE

08:03:21.472 --> 08:03:23.774
CONNECTED. TO THE HEALTHY THINGS

08:03:23.841 --> 08:03:24.675
IN THEIR LIVES THEY'RE GOING TO

08:03:24.742 --> 08:03:26.277
HELP THEM REBUILD THEIR LIVES.

08:03:26.344 --> 08:03:27.678
KEEP THEM CONNECTED TO THEIR

08:03:27.745 --> 08:03:29.814
SPOUSE OF THEIR MARRIAGE. KEEP

08:03:29.880 --> 08:03:30.981

THEY'RE PURSUING AN ADVANCED

08:03:35.653 --> 08:03:37.455
DEGREE OR A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND

08:03:37.521 --> 08:03:39.290
I THINK OUR SYSTEM SOMETIMES

08:03:39.357 --> 08:03:40.558
SAYS WE'RE GONNA KNOCK YOU OFF

08:03:40.624 --> 08:03:42.827
OF THAT. AND LET YOU DEAL WITH

08:03:42.893 --> 08:03:43.928
YOUR ILLNESS AND THEN YOU CAN

08:03:43.994 --> 08:03:45.730
COME BACK. KNOCKING PEOPLE OFF

08:03:45.796 --> 08:03:47.264
THE CONVEYOR BELT CAN BE THE

08:03:47.331 --> 08:03:49.133
WORST THING YOU CAN DO TO THEM.

08:03:49.200 --> 08:03:50.267
AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANT TO

08:03:50.334 --> 08:03:52.703
QUOTE. THE EDITORIAL FROM THE L.

08:03:52.770 --> 08:03:54.872
A. TIMES YESTERDAY. THIS WAS THE

08:03:54.939 --> 08:03:56.073
STATEMENT THAT WAS MOST POWERFUL

08:06:15.613 --> 08:06:17.748
ALL THAT EXPERIENCE. THAT

08:06:17.815 --> 08:06:20.050
PREPARED ME TO TRY TO BE THE

BEST MOTHER I COULD TO MY SON.

08:06:24.021 --> 08:06:26.991

YEARS TO GET HIM TO SEE A

08:06:43.073 --> 08:06:45.676
PSYCHIATRIST WHEN HE FINALLY DID

THE TIME THAT HE- BEFORE THAT

08:06:58.923 --> 08:07:03.494
LET ME PUT IT THAT WAY. HE WAS

08:07:03.561 --> 08:07:05.763
SOMEONE WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL

08:07:05.829 --> 08:07:08.566
ILLNESS WHO DENIED HIS ILLNESS I

08:07:08.632 --> 08:07:10.834
THINK IT'S PRONOUNCED AT AND

08:07:10.901 --> 08:07:14.538
THOSE WITH NO SHIP. AND HE WENT

08:07:14.605 --> 08:07:17.207
FOUR YEARS WITH NOTHING WRONG

08:07:17.274 --> 08:07:18.709
WITH HIM HE DIDN'T NEED

08:07:18.776 --> 08:07:21.145
TREATMENT DURING ALL OF THAT

08:07:21.211 --> 08:07:23.480
TIME HE WAS EITHER LIVING ON THE

08:07:23.547 --> 08:07:26.283
STREETS. OCCASIONALLY IN MY

08:07:26.350 --> 08:07:32.122
BACKYARD IN JAIL FOR SEVERAL

08:07:32.189 --> 08:07:32.756
FIFTY ONE FIFTY THE HOLDS THAT

08:07:32.823 --> 08:07:35.326
BECAME A LITTLE LONGER THAT WAS

08:07:35.392 --> 08:07:38.128
A LIFE HE LIVED IN MY I CANNOT

08:07:38.195 --> 08:07:41.699
STRESS TO YOU ENOUGH THAT LPS

08:07:41.765 --> 08:07:45.369
HAVE TO CONSIDER THOSE PEOPLE

08:07:45.436 --> 08:07:47.338
WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS

08:07:47.404 --> 08:07:49.306
WHO DENIED THEIR ILLNESS WHO

08:07:49.373 --> 08:07:51.175
DON'T HAVE INSIGHT. THEY'RE

08:07:51.241 --> 08:07:54.011
COMPLETELY ALMOST COMPLETELY

08:07:54.078 --> 08:07:56.380
OVERLOOKED IN OUR SYSTEM AND I

08:07:56.447 --> 08:07:58.315
UNDERSTAND IT GETS POLITICAL

08:07:58.382 --> 08:08:00.084
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT CIVIL

08:08:00.150 --> 08:08:01.986
RIGHTS AND CHOICE BUT THERE'S

08:08:02.052 --> 08:08:06.657
ROOM. FOR BOTH IN L. P. S. BUT

08:08:06.724 --> 08:08:07.791
THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I WILL

08:08:07.858 --> 08:08:12.730
TO MENTION OF. BESIDES THAT WAS

08:08:12.796 --> 08:08:14.331

ABOUT CARE GIVERS. I KNOW MORE

08:08:21.805 --> 08:08:24.274
ABOUT MY SON THAN ANYONE ELSE

08:08:24.341 --> 08:08:25.976
I'VE GIVEN HIM MORE TREATMENT

08:08:26.043 --> 08:08:27.978
THAN ANYONE ELSE I'VE BEEN

08:08:28.045 --> 08:08:31.115
AROUND HIM ALL HIS LIFE I DON'T

08:08:31.181 --> 08:08:33.884
COUNT. HIPPLE PREVENTS PEOPLE

08:08:33.951 --> 08:08:36.153
FROM TALKING TO ME ATTITUDE

08:08:36.220 --> 08:08:38.188
PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM TALKING TO

08:08:38.255 --> 08:08:41.558
ME THE POLICE WON'T TALK TO ME

08:08:41.625 --> 08:08:43.494
THE POLICE HAVE BEEN TO MY HOUSE

08:08:43.560 --> 08:08:45.996
NUMEROUS TIMES AND THE ONLY

08:08:46.063 --> 08:08:48.232
ADVICE THEY GAVE ME BELIEVE IT

08:08:48.298 --> 08:08:50.100

08:09:06.383 --> 08:09:09.153
DISCUSSION ABOUT DUAL DIAGNOSIS

08:09:09.219 --> 08:09:11.055
YOU'LL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A

08:09:11.121 --> 08:09:12.723

VERY CRITICAL TOPIC. VERY

08:09:58.802 --> 08:10:00.704
FAMILIAR WITH THE LPS ACT AS

CONSERVATORSHIP. SO I WANT TO

08:10:26.730 --> 08:10:27.765

08:10:32.936 --> 08:10:34.104
CHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR THE LPS

08:10:34.171 --> 08:10:35.873
ACT. AND WHICH POINTS DO NOT

08:10:35.939 --> 08:10:37.708

MOST RECENTLY IN TWENTY TWENTY

08:10:44.882 --> 08:10:47.284
ONE. AND THOSE LAWS NEED TO BE

08:10:47.351 --> 08:10:49.820
DEMONSTRATE. HOW BENEFICIAL

08:10:49.887 --> 08:10:51.989
OUTCOMES. SOME HAVE NOT EVEN

08:10:52.055 --> 08:10:53.657
BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR EXAMPLE

DESPITE HEARING SOME EVIDENCE TO

DEMONSTRATED THAT THERE'S NO

08:11:57.154 --> 08:11:58.689
EVIDENCE THAT MANDATING

08:11:58.755 --> 08:12:00.524
OUTPATIENT TREATMENT THROUGH A

08:19:06.416 --> 08:19:07.884
AND OF THE STAFF OF BOTH

08:19:07.951 --> 08:19:09.452
COMMITTEES WHO PRODUCED A

08:19:09.519 --> 08:19:11.688
BACKGROUND PAPER. THAT IS

08:19:11.755 --> 08:19:14.324
UNPARALLELED- FORTY FIVE FISH

08:19:14.391 --> 08:19:15.992
PAGES WITH A LOT OF REALLY GOOD

08:19:16.059 --> 08:19:17.060
BACKGROUND IT IT I THINK ANYBODY

08:19:17.127 --> 08:19:18.561
WHO'S- BEEN A PART OF THIS

08:19:18.628 --> 08:19:20.263
HEARING OR IS WATCHING IT FROM

08:19:20.330 --> 08:19:20.897
AFAR WOULD BENEFIT FROM READING

08:19:20.964 --> 08:19:23.733
IT- MY COMMENTS WERE TALKING

08:19:23.800 --> 08:19:26.002
ABOUT. CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS

08:19:26.069 --> 08:19:27.837
IN IN THE MORNING I'D SHARE THE

08:19:27.904 --> 08:19:29.539
KEY CHALLENGE FOR COUNTIES.

08:19:29.606 --> 08:19:31.141
WHICH WAS A VARIETY OF THINGS

08:19:31.207 --> 08:19:33.043
BUT FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR

08:19:33.109 --> 08:19:37.981
PUBLIC GUARDIANS- YOU DON'T. I

08:19:38.048 --> 08:19:40.583
HAVE THREE SUGGESTIONS FOR

08:19:40.650 --> 08:19:43.019
CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS UP ONCE

08:19:43.086 --> 08:19:44.487
SHORT TERM WANT TO MEDIUM TERM

08:19:44.554 --> 08:19:46.156
ONCE A LONG TERM WHAT I WANT TO

08:19:46.222 --> 08:19:49.459
KNOW FIRST IS THAT MANY OF THE

08:19:49.526 --> 08:19:50.226
PROGRAMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

08:19:50.293 --> 08:19:52.762
TODAY THAT ARE INNOVATIVE THAT

08:19:52.829 --> 08:19:53.763
HELP PEOPLE MEET THEM WHERE THEY

08:19:53.830 --> 08:19:56.433
ARE OUR PILOT PROGRAMS ARE GRANT

08:19:56.499 --> 08:20:00.637
FUNDED PROGRAMS- ARE. OFTEN OR

08:20:00.704 --> 08:20:02.772
VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS IN FACT EVEN

08:20:02.839 --> 08:20:05.442
THE EXPANSION OF LAURA'S LAW- BY

08:20:05.508 --> 08:20:06.776
SENATOR EGGMAN REALLY HAS

08:20:06.843 --> 08:20:08.244
EXPANDED THOSE SERVICES IN

08:20:08.311 --> 08:20:09.813
CALIFORNIA AND I THINK THAT'S TO

08:20:09.879 --> 08:20:12.482
THE GOOD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS-

08:20:12.549 --> 08:20:14.317
WAS DONE WITHOUT ANY FUNDING FOR

08:20:14.384 --> 08:20:16.286
COUNTY IS WILLING TO OPT IN. AND

08:20:16.353 --> 08:20:19.556
SO I CAN LIST TEN PROGRAMS THE

08:20:19.622 --> 08:20:23.760
PEER SUPPORT SERVICES- THE IT'S

08:20:23.827 --> 08:20:25.662
S. B. EIGHTY TWO MOBILE CRISIS

08:20:25.729 --> 08:20:28.131
TEAMS LARA ALL OF THESE GOOD

08:20:28.198 --> 08:20:29.632
INNOVATIONS HAVE OCCURRED

08:20:29.699 --> 08:20:31.568
WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING

08:20:31.634 --> 08:20:32.702
AND SO I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT

08:20:32.769 --> 08:20:35.372
THAT- IF WE WANT TO MAKE BIG

08:20:35.438 --> 08:20:37.374
CHANGES WHO TRULY WANT TO HELP

08:20:37.440 --> 08:20:38.808
WE NEED THE STATE'S HELP WITH

08:20:38.875 --> 08:20:42.512
THAT- IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE. MY

08:20:42.579 --> 08:20:46.316
SHORT TERM. SUGGESTION IS IT OF

08:20:46.383 --> 08:20:49.018
COURSE COUNTIES ARE IN ANY IN

08:20:49.085 --> 08:20:50.920
NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

08:20:50.987 --> 08:20:52.155
CASE LOOKS THAT THE PUBLIC

08:20:52.222 --> 08:20:53.089
GUARDIANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH

08:20:53.156 --> 08:20:54.791
CURRENTLY BEFORE ANY OTHER

08:20:54.858 --> 08:20:56.826
POLICY CHANGES ARE MADE- THEY'VE

08:20:56.893 --> 08:20:58.528
NOTED THE INCREASE IN FORENSIC

08:20:58.595 --> 08:21:00.330
REFERRALS THOSE FROM THE JAILS

08:21:00.397 --> 08:21:01.965
AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

08:21:02.031 --> 08:21:04.300
AS WELL AS- JUST GENERALLY MORE

08:21:04.367 --> 08:21:05.902
AN INCREASE IN POPULATION AND

08:21:05.969 --> 08:21:08.138
MORE FOLKS THAT ARE REFERRED FOR

08:21:08.204 --> 08:21:09.406
AT LEAST INVESTIGATION FOR THIS

08:21:09.472 --> 08:21:11.508
SO THE SHORT TERM SOLUTION. THAT

08:21:11.574 --> 08:21:13.710
COULD BE ADDRESSED IN TWENTY

08:21:13.777 --> 08:21:15.311
TWENTY TO EARLY TWENTY TWENTY

08:21:15.378 --> 08:21:16.212
TWO COULD BE SOMETHING TARGETED

08:21:16.279 --> 08:21:17.914
FUNDING TO HELP PUBLIC GUARDIANS

08:21:17.981 --> 08:21:20.183
DEAL WITH THOSE RISING CASELOADS

08:21:20.250 --> 08:21:22.051
AND IMPROVE CARE. THE MEDIUM

08:21:22.118 --> 08:21:23.620
TERM AND THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY

08:21:23.686 --> 08:21:25.321
IMPORTANT IS AS WE'VE ALL TALKED

08:21:25.388 --> 08:21:26.623
ABOUT TODAY THE DATA AND

08:21:26.689 --> 08:21:28.992
TRANSPARENCY EFFORTS. IT'S NOT

08:21:29.058 --> 08:21:29.559
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

08:21:29.626 --> 08:21:31.828
ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY- THE

08:21:31.895 --> 08:21:32.862
INEQUITIES THAT BEEN MENTIONED

08:21:32.929 --> 08:21:35.231
HERE TODAY- THE FACT THAT WE

08:21:35.298 --> 08:21:37.567
DON'T HVE THE STATISTICS. THE

08:21:37.634 --> 08:21:40.270
FACT THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE OF

08:21:40.336 --> 08:21:41.371
COLOR ARE EVEN INVOLVED IN THIS

08:21:41.438 --> 08:21:44.374
HEARING- BELIES THE NEED THAT WE

08:21:44.441 --> 08:21:45.408
NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHO WERE

08:21:45.475 --> 08:21:47.043
TREATING. HOW WE'RE TREATING

08:21:47.110 --> 08:21:49.012
THEM OF COURSE- MEASURE AND

08:21:49.078 --> 08:21:51.147
DETERMINE OUTCOMES SO THE DEMAND

08:21:51.214 --> 08:21:52.782
TRANSPARENCY I CLASSIFY AS A

08:21:52.849 --> 08:21:55.652
MEDIUM TERM. GOAL IN THAT- IF WE

08:21:55.718 --> 08:22:00.190
HAD SOME FUNDING AND SOME CLEAR-

08:22:00.256 --> 08:22:04.127
STANDARDS AND- DATA REQUIRED AND

08:22:04.194 --> 08:22:04.794
OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO MEASURE

08:22:04.861 --> 08:22:07.030
SET FORTH. THEN WE CAN BEGIN

08:22:07.096 --> 08:22:08.865
MEASURING THAT SO I CLASSIFIED

08:22:08.932 --> 08:22:11.167
AS MEDIUM TERM. THE LAST PIECE

08:22:11.234 --> 08:22:12.735
IS A LONG TERM PEACE AND IT'S

08:22:12.802 --> 08:22:14.771
THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES- THAT

08:22:14.838 --> 08:22:16.039
WE'VE ALL HEARD TODAY BY EVERY

08:22:16.105 --> 08:22:18.107
SINGLE PERSON REGARDLESS OF.

08:22:18.174 --> 08:22:20.043
WHERE THEY STAND ON LPS ISSUES

08:22:20.109 --> 08:22:21.778
WHICH IS THE NEED FOR HOUSING.

08:22:21.845 --> 08:22:22.979
OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR AND THIS

08:22:23.046 --> 08:22:25.114
LEGISLATURE IS INVESTMENT IN THE

08:22:25.181 --> 08:22:26.683
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM

08:22:26.749 --> 08:22:28.384
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AS WELL

08:22:28.451 --> 08:22:31.087
AS- FUNDING FOR SOME MOBILE

08:22:31.154 --> 08:22:31.988
CRISIS TEAMS AS WELL AS FUNDING

08:22:32.055 --> 08:22:34.891
FOR OTHER- KINDS OF BETS LIKE

08:22:34.958 --> 08:22:35.658
BOARDING CARE A LITTLE BIT OF

08:22:35.725 --> 08:22:38.027
FUN IN THERE- THIS IS A LONG

08:22:38.094 --> 08:22:40.330
TERM. IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE

08:22:40.396 --> 08:22:42.699
THAN A YEAR. IF NOT TWO OR THREE

08:22:42.765 --> 08:22:44.467
OR FOUR BEFORE WE REALLY START

08:22:44.534 --> 08:22:46.503
REAPING. THE REWARDS OF THOSE

08:22:46.569 --> 08:22:49.172
INVESTMENTS- WITH MORE BAD SAFE

08:22:49.239 --> 08:22:50.406
PLACES TO PUT THE PEOPLE WE ALL

08:22:50.473 --> 08:22:54.277
SERVE. WITH THAT IN IN THE

08:22:54.344 --> 08:22:55.845
INTEREST OF TIME. I COULD. THANK

08:22:55.912 --> 08:22:56.813
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH

08:22:56.880 --> 08:23:00.149
APPRECIATED WE WILL GO AHEAD AND

08:23:00.216 --> 08:23:02.819
MOVE ON TO DOCTOR SHARON.

08:23:02.886 --> 08:23:04.521
REMOTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

08:23:04.587 --> 08:23:06.890
CHAIRS STONE AND WOOD AND TO ALL

08:23:06.956 --> 08:23:09.459
THE MEMBERS- I DO WANT TO

08:23:09.526 --> 08:23:10.426
COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP

08:23:10.493 --> 08:23:12.195
AND PULLING THIS LARGE GROUP

08:23:12.262 --> 08:23:14.664
TOGETHER YOUNG SUCH A BROAD. SET

08:23:14.731 --> 08:23:17.133
OF INFORMATION- I ALSO WOULD

08:23:17.200 --> 08:23:18.301
LIKE TO RECOGNIZE GERALD

08:23:18.368 --> 08:23:22.405
STEINBERG AND HIS- YOU KNOW.

08:23:22.472 --> 08:23:25.408
REQUESTED OR SUGGESTED THAT BOLD

08:23:25.475 --> 08:23:29.145
ACTION- IS NEEDED I THINK IT'S

08:23:29.212 --> 08:23:31.848
DEMANDED BY THE SITUATION- I

08:23:31.915 --> 08:23:32.982
WANT TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON SOME

08:23:33.049 --> 08:23:36.753
OF THE- BILL IS SOME SOLUTIONS

08:23:36.819 --> 08:23:37.320
TO PROBLEMS THAT I DISCUSSED

08:23:37.387 --> 08:23:40.089
THIS MORNING- THE STANDARD-

08:23:40.156 --> 08:23:42.492
WHICH- REALLY FOR ME IS A IS A

08:23:42.559 --> 08:23:43.459
DISCUSSION ABOUT GRADE

08:23:43.526 --> 08:23:45.428
DISABILITY. THE NEED FOR TOOLS

08:23:45.495 --> 08:23:48.364
OF ENGAGEMENT AND THEN- THAT THE

08:23:48.431 --> 08:23:49.632
REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE

08:23:49.699 --> 08:23:51.901
RESOURCES TO DELIVER TO OF

08:23:51.968 --> 08:23:55.305
ANYONE THAT'S GOING TO RECEIVE.

08:23:55.371 --> 08:23:55.905
ANY TYPE OF- COMPELLED

08:23:55.972 --> 08:23:58.808
ENGAGEMENT- THE FIRST THING IS

08:23:58.875 --> 08:24:01.044
REALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT- LPS LAW

08:24:01.110 --> 08:24:03.146
THE ORIGINAL. LANGUAGE REALLY

08:24:03.212 --> 08:24:04.881
REFLECTED NOT SO MUCH GOOD

08:24:04.948 --> 08:24:06.950
DISABILITY- SAY BUT A LARGER

08:24:07.016 --> 08:24:08.918
PLATFORM OF THE INABILITY TO

08:24:08.985 --> 08:24:10.887
LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY DUE

08:24:10.954 --> 08:24:14.290
TO A SERIOUS. MENTAL ILLNESS AND

08:24:14.357 --> 08:24:16.693
AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT CARE-

08:24:16.759 --> 08:24:18.161
I BELIEVE THAT THAT WORKS IN THE

08:24:18.227 --> 08:24:20.263
ACUTE OR EMINENT SENSE IN TERMS

08:24:20.330 --> 08:24:22.932
OF SOMEONE BEING HOMICIDAL OR

08:24:22.999 --> 08:24:24.601
SUICIDAL. DEMOCRATIC SENSE IT

08:24:24.667 --> 08:24:26.769
DOES NOT WORK THAT'S ABOUT WHAT

08:24:26.836 --> 08:24:27.770
I BELIEVE IS REALLY AT THE CORE

08:24:27.837 --> 08:24:31.641
TOPIC. OF CONVERSATION TODAY AND

08:24:31.708 --> 08:24:33.743
THEIR NUMBER REASONS FOR THAT-

08:24:33.810 --> 08:24:36.012
INTERPRETATION OF THE INDICATORS

08:24:36.079 --> 08:24:37.914
OF GREAT DISABILITY OTHER WHICH

08:24:37.981 --> 08:24:39.549
YOU SEE SHOWS UP IN VARIABLE

08:24:39.616 --> 08:24:41.851
IMPLEMENTATION. THINGS LIKE DATA

08:24:41.918 --> 08:24:43.419
BEING LIMITED FOR THE COURTS AND

08:24:43.486 --> 08:24:45.488
FOR THE JUDGES I'M AND THE

08:24:45.555 --> 08:24:48.858
JURIES- THE YOUR LACK OF INPUT

08:24:48.925 --> 08:24:50.560
FROM CARE GIVERS WHICH WE JUST

08:24:50.627 --> 08:24:52.095
HEARD ABOUT I WHICH IS A

08:24:52.161 --> 08:24:54.731
PROBLEM. AND REALLY WHAT WE END

08:24:54.797 --> 08:24:57.000
UP SEEING IS- IT. FIFTY ONE

08:24:57.066 --> 08:24:58.768
FIFTIES WHICH LEAD TO MULTIPLE

08:24:58.835 --> 08:25:01.204
ADMISSIONS FOR INPATIENT CARE

08:25:01.270 --> 08:25:03.206
WHICH IS ACTUALLY FOR ACUTE

08:25:03.272 --> 08:25:05.908
SERVICES AND- GREAT DISABILITY

08:25:05.975 --> 08:25:07.110
OR NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE

08:25:07.176 --> 08:25:09.145
COMMUNITY ARE CHRONIC. EARNS AND

08:25:09.212 --> 08:25:10.580
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN

08:25:10.647 --> 08:25:11.114
YOU PUT SOMEONE INTO THE

08:25:11.180 --> 08:25:13.282
HOSPITAL THAT CAN BE TOXIC

08:25:13.349 --> 08:25:14.651
EXPERIENCE A TRAUMATIZING

08:25:14.717 --> 08:25:16.319
EXPERIENCE ALSO WE HAVE A

08:25:16.386 --> 08:25:18.287
LIMITED NUMBER OF BEDS OR BEDS

08:25:18.354 --> 08:25:20.490
ARE ALL JAMS AND NOT AVAILABLE

08:25:20.556 --> 08:25:21.224
FOR FOLKS THAT THE ACUTE

08:25:21.290 --> 08:25:23.726
SERVICES. AND WE SPENT A LOT OF

08:25:23.793 --> 08:25:25.595
MONEY AND FRANKLY THE HOSPITAL

08:25:25.662 --> 08:25:27.930
SYSTEMS CAN'T DRAW DOWN MONEY

08:25:27.997 --> 08:25:29.165
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN WITH

08:25:29.232 --> 08:25:31.768
CHRONIC. CONDITIONS IN FACT THIS

08:25:31.834 --> 08:25:33.202
MAY BE A CONTROVERSIAL THING TO

08:25:33.269 --> 08:25:34.737
SAY BUT IF IT WERE UP TO ME I

08:25:34.804 --> 08:25:36.105
WOULD CONSIDER STRIKING GREAT

08:25:36.172 --> 08:25:38.408
DISABILITY FROM THE FIFTY ONE

08:25:38.474 --> 08:25:39.475
FIFTY BECAUSE GREAT DISABILITY

08:25:39.542 --> 08:25:41.611
DOES NOT INDICATE AN IMMINENT-

08:25:41.678 --> 08:25:46.249
CUTE. SCENARIO SO I'M- ARGUING

08:25:46.315 --> 08:25:47.950
FOR A REVISITING XIN OF WHAT

08:25:48.017 --> 08:25:50.520
LIVING SAFELY MEANS. THESE ARE

08:25:50.586 --> 08:25:51.521
THREE INDICATORS I BELIEVE THAT

08:25:51.587 --> 08:25:53.823
THERE ARE MORE. AND THAT WHEN WE

08:25:53.890 --> 08:25:55.224
IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT

08:25:55.291 --> 08:25:56.993
LIVING SAFE IN THE COMMUNITY.

08:25:57.060 --> 08:25:59.328
FOR REASONS- RELATED TO THEIR

08:25:59.395 --> 08:26:00.963
MENTAL ILLNESS AND AYE AYE AND

08:26:01.030 --> 08:26:02.699
WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT CARE. WE

08:26:02.765 --> 08:26:04.434
NEED A PROPER SET OF TOOLS

08:26:04.500 --> 08:26:06.569
THAT'S BROADER. THAN JUST A

08:26:06.636 --> 08:26:08.504
CONSERVATORSHIP AND GUARANTEED

08:26:08.571 --> 08:26:10.273
RESOURCES IN TERMS OF THE TOOLS

08:26:10.339 --> 08:26:11.240
OF ENGAGED I MENTION OF THEM

08:26:11.307 --> 08:26:12.809
THIS MORNING. SHARE DECISION

08:26:12.875 --> 08:26:14.377
MAKING PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE

08:26:14.444 --> 08:26:16.412
DIRECTIVES THE L. T. PROGRAM I

08:26:16.479 --> 08:26:18.448
WANT TO SALUTE CENTER EGGMAN FOR

08:26:18.514 --> 08:26:21.718
IMPROVEMENTS AND THE TEMPORARY

08:26:21.784 --> 08:26:23.553
AND A FULL CONSERVATORSHIP- ONE

08:26:23.619 --> 08:26:24.687
OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN

08:26:24.754 --> 08:26:26.956
WITH A- FIFTY ONE FIFTIES AND IS

08:26:27.023 --> 08:26:29.225
THAT THERE'S NO LINKAGE AFTER. A

08:26:29.292 --> 08:26:29.992
FIFTY ONE FIFTIES BECAUSE WE

08:26:30.059 --> 08:26:31.894
DON'T HAVE OTHER TOOLS. AND IT

08:26:31.961 --> 08:26:33.930
CAN'T BE ALL OR NOTHING. AND I

08:26:33.996 --> 08:26:35.531
WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT A BODY OF

08:26:35.598 --> 08:26:37.366
LAW IS NEEDED TO CAN'T BE

08:26:37.433 --> 08:26:39.635
ENGINEERED AS ONE OFFS- THAT'S

08:26:39.702 --> 08:26:40.870
AN IMPORTANT THING FOR I WOULD

08:26:40.937 --> 08:26:42.238
SUGGEST THE LAWMAKERS TO THINK

08:26:42.305 --> 08:26:43.940
ABOUT. IN TERMS OF GUARANTEED

08:26:44.006 --> 08:26:46.509
RESOURCES UP FRONT- CIVIL

08:26:46.576 --> 08:26:48.144
LIBERTIES COMPEL US TO GUARANTEE

08:26:48.211 --> 08:26:49.545
RESOURCES BEFORE WE MESS WITH

08:26:49.612 --> 08:26:53.116
ANYBODY'S- CIVIL LIBERTIES. AND

08:26:53.182 --> 08:26:54.350
WHEN I TALK ABOUT RESEARCH THAT

08:26:54.417 --> 08:26:55.952
I'M TALKING ABOUT HOUSING OF ALL

08:26:56.018 --> 08:26:57.120
TYPES NOT JUST PERMANENT

08:26:57.186 --> 08:26:59.155
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. BUT ALSO

08:26:59.222 --> 08:27:00.423
CONGREGATE HOUSING BOARDING

08:27:00.490 --> 08:27:03.226
CHAIRS FOR EXAMPLE AND THERE'S A

08:27:03.292 --> 08:27:03.860
HUGE PROBABLY BOARDING HAS WHICH

08:27:03.926 --> 08:27:05.962
ARE DISAPPEARING OFF THE FACE OF

08:27:06.028 --> 08:27:07.964
A CALIFORNIA FOREVER IDEA

08:27:08.030 --> 08:27:08.931
REASONS THEY'RE NO LONGER

08:27:08.998 --> 08:27:10.233
AFFORDABLE. FULL SERVICE

08:27:10.299 --> 08:27:11.701
PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

08:27:11.768 --> 08:27:13.102
REAL ACCOUNTABLE AND WE'RE IN

08:27:13.169 --> 08:27:15.471
THE PROCESS OF. RE ENGINEERING-

ARE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP

08:27:17.340 --> 08:27:19.742
APPROACH- AND WE'VE DONE THAT IN

08:27:19.809 --> 08:27:21.577

WHO I'D LIKE TO THINK IT WAS

08:27:31.420 --> 08:27:32.989

08:27:33.055 --> 08:27:35.925
GOAL. WITH AN ENGAGEMENT TOOLS

08:27:35.992 --> 08:27:37.860
IS TO GET PEOPLE ON IT RECOVERY

PATHWAY SO THAT THEY DON'T NEED

08:27:40.229 --> 08:27:41.497

PILOT WHICH WE'RE DOING WHICH

08:28:02.251 --> 08:28:04.687
SAVES MONEY. OUR OWN PILOT IS

08:28:04.754 --> 08:28:06.656
BASED ON GUARANTEED RESOURCES

08:28:06.722 --> 08:28:07.924
AND RELENTLESS ENGAGEMENT WE

08:28:07.990 --> 08:28:09.058
HEARD THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE

CASES TO THE COURTS. BASED ON

08:28:54.403 --> 08:28:56.372
SOMEONE LIVING ON THE STREET AND

08:28:56.439 --> 08:28:57.740

08:29:28.437 --> 08:29:30.239
