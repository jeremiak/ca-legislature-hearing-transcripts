AND SO THAT THE NATURAL DISCOURAGE SORT OF FORMING COMPONENTS OF THE SENATE HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENT. THIRTY THOMPSON APARTMENT OF FINANCE HAPPEN TO REVIEW THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW OPEN THE DISCUSSION TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'D LIKE TO START START OFF- MYSELF WITH IT WITH THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS- AND ACTUALLY JUST UP POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE I HAD A QUESTION- ABOUT. OBTAINING DATA FROM- ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT KEEP IN THE HALFPIPE EFFORTS WE'VE MADE TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AND- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE DEPARTMENT- SIX SIX WELL ACTUALLY IT'S THE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY THERE IS A HOMELESS COORDINATING FINANCING COUNCIL AND- AND THEY HAVE DEVISED A PORTALS- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO START CAPTURING DATA ON. WHAT THE SUCCESS OR LACK OF IT. AS ENTITIES HAVE STARTED DOING THEIR THEIR HOMELESS- CALORIES AND- OFFERING SERVICES THAT WE PUT OUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY OVER THE PAST COUPLE BUDGET CYCLES. IN EXCESS OF A BILLION DOLLARS AND I WONDER IF SOMEBODY- FROM. B. C. S. NH IS BASED ON THE LINE TO TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS PORTAL BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DOCUMENT. HOW ARE WE DOING AND WHAT COMMUNITIES HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. AND AND ARE WE ALLOCATING THE MONEY TO THE RIGHT TO THE RIGHT AT ENTITIES WITHIN THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. I'M IS THERE SOMEONE ON THE LINE THAT CAN- TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. HELLO THIS IS ALEX HODINKEE SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS OVER AT DISNEY'S CONSUMER SERVICES I THINK AGENCY CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME OKAY WE CAN WE CAN SEE YOU KNOW THANK YOU SO MUCH HEY. THE HOBBIT INTERVIEW ONE I AM ARE REALLY OF THE- INTEGRATIONS. MIGHT HAVE WENT LIVE JUST LAST MONTH. IT IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG WHAT WE RELEASED THERE IS QUITE A BIT AND DATA TO BE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED THEIR AND I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S NOT JUST- THOSE THAT ARE SEARCHING STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS BUT ALSO LOCAL AND FEDERAL FUNDING SO IT ALLOWS US TO REALLY GREAT. SORT OF MY FULLER PICTURE. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND THE SERVICES THAT OUR SEATING UNTIL YOU ADD SOME INFORMATION IN THERE AND THAT WE'RE WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO ANALYZE. AROUND HE BEHALF AND WE ARE WORKING TO TRY TO WORK WITH ENERGY DEPARTMENT UNITED HIDE AT THE BATTLE FROM THERE FUNDING PROGRAMS AND THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT THEY HAVE SERVICE. I'M AND ANY ARE EXPECTING IT THAT IS THAT KIND OF THING MANY SHY. ASK AND CAN. AS WE GET GOING I WILL SAY- BUT BUSINESS ITSELF IS REALLY. TEN TO BE A- TRACKING. SYSTEM HAVE OTHER. OTHER TRACKING. FOR KEEPING HER AROUND AND I'M JUST FINDING IS BEING. ON LEADS. AND THIS IS MUCH ABOUT THAT. THE FOLKS THAT ARE SERVER AND WHAT HALF TÃ¬M THEY MOVED IS. VERY MUCH AT PERFORMANCE TOOL. AND TO YOUR- AND VERY MUCH SOMETHING THE WHOLE. AND HOW THAT ARE. WHAT WE- OUT AND- HOW IT WOULD BE SPENDING ARE FINDING WILL BE ABLE. AND I ENSURING THAT IT IS USED IN THE- IN THE PAST MOST. WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT AND I. WAS NOT LOOKING FOR A FINANCE TOLL I WAS LOOKING MORE FOR A- A SUCCESS- FOUR EIGHT. I'M A TOOL TO EVALUATE- MAYBE. BASED ON REGION WHO'S. DOING A GOOD JOB- THIS IS THE ISSUE OF HOME. IS NUMBER. ISSUE PEOPLE ARE. WITH ONLY. ALL OVER THIS. IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT. THAT ONE REGION THAT SUFFERING. THE IMPACTS OF THE HOME OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION IT'S THE NTIRE STATE. AND AS WE PUT MONEY OUT THE QUESTION THAT'S BEEN RAISED TO ME. IS THE APPROPRIATE RECEIVER OF THE MONEY THE COCS IS IT THE COUNTIES OR IS IT THE CITIES OR A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE I'VE GOT A NUMBER OF MARES COMPLAINING THAT THEY DON'T SEE ANY OF THE RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. MUERTES AND THEN- AS I'VE ASKED FOR DATA FROM THE COCS. BOB IT HAS NOT BEEN FORTHCOMING SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CONTINUING TO FIND. ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY NOT BE RESPONSIVE IN IN TERMS OF TELLING US WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE RESOURCES. ARE THEY GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE SEEN. AND AND HOW WHAT KIND OF SERVICES ARE THEY OFFERING AND ARE THERE SOME BUT BEST PRACTICES SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRAMEWORK I THINK IT'S GOING TO GIVE US. SOME OF THE DATA AND- AND IN IN UP UP IN ADDITION TO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO WANT TO SEE IN THIS PARTICULAR. AREA IS THAT. IF WE CONTINUE TO FIND THE COCS THEY ARE A CREATION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AS SUCH THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO ABIDE BY. BUT THE RULES THE GOVERNMENT DOES SUCH AS OPEN MEETING LAWS POSTING THE AGENDAS CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS SOME OF THE COCS. ARE MADE UP OF MEMBERS WHO RECEIVE THE MONEY AND MOUNTAINS THAT'S THAT WOULD BE PROHIBITED ANY OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SO. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE CONTINU TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS AND TO SET UP. THE THIS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO IT THAT WE MAKE SURE THERE'S TRANSPARENCY. THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND- AND THE OP FOR THE TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY GOING. FOR THE TO PART IN MEETINGS ABOUT THE AS WELL SO THOSE ARE THOSE THAT THAT I HAVE SOME OF WANNA. MAKE SURE WE- I THINK THAT- AND THEN LAST- ISSUE IN THIS THIS- THE KEEPER THE KEY. OUR RESOURCES HAVE BEEN TERM- THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE EXISTING INFO ON HOTELS AND MOTELS AND THEN USE IT TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME- THE ABILITY TO. KEEP THOSE UNITS AFFORDABLE THAT THAT IF THE MONEY DRIES UP SME SOME SOMETIME ALONG THE LINE WHETHER IT'S STATE REVENUES OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES THAT THE HOUSING THAT HAS BEEN PURCHASE STAYS AFFORDABLE AND IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE THE AFFORDABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE THOSE- THOSE ARE- UNITS SO THERE HAVE TO BE COVENANTS THAT PROTECT THAT AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING IT IN ANY SYSTEM SO. THAT A LOT OF A LOT OF ISSUES THERE BUT I THINK FROM. THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES SO WE CAN. WE CAN GET THE UNITS WE DESPERATELY NEED. THAT'S IT FOR ME SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU'RE CERTAINLY DID PROVOKE A LOT OF INTEREST IN ME WITH YOUR REMARKS RIGHT NOW. I'VE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE FOR AN AWFUL LOT OF YEARS AND I HAVE LIKE AND HOW CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK MANY OTHER STATES AS WELL ABOUT WITHTHE HOMELESS POPULATION IT'S LIKE AN ABSTRACT ARTIST. WE GET A BIG WHITE CREATED WALL. BRING IN A BUCKET OF PAINT THE WHAT BRUSHING GOES SPORTFISHING IT AGAINST THE WALL. I THINK THAT'S BEEN FOOLHARDY IN FACT I'M GOING NOW EVEN FURTHER I BELIEVE THAT IN TERMS OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION WE SHOULD BEGIN ASSESSING THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS AS WE DO IN THE SCHOOL THE I. E. P. INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN WHAT ARE THE NEEDS OF THAT HOMELESS POPULATION PROVIDING A SHELTER. A PLACE TO SLEEP IS NOT SUFFICIENT. OTHER THAN TO KEEP THEM IN THAT STATE. I WOULD RATHER SEE THEM BE ABLE TO TRANSITION. INTO A MORE PERMANENT STATE OF SURVIVABILITY. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN ALL THAT SUCCESSFUL IN DOING IT. AND I WOULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE GAME PROGRAM WHICH NOW HAS BEEN FOR MANY YEARS CALLED CAL WORKS. IT WAS A HISTORIC CHANGE IN WELFARE REFORM THE SAME KIND OF PRINCIPLE WOULD APPLY HERE. WORK ADDRESSING NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS NOT JUST WHERE THEY SLEEP. AND NOT EVEN JUST WHERE THEY EAT. BUT HOW DO THEY SURVIVE. AND I'LL TELL YOU MAYBE SOME PEOPLE DON'T MIND LIVING ON THE STREETS ON THE RIVER BANKS. BUT I THINK THAT WE FOR THEM AND THEY THEMSELVES CAN DO BETTER. AND THAT GOVERNS MY THINKING AS WE DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NELSON- THIS ITEM IS A HOLD OPEN SO WILL NOW MOVE TO THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER SIX. SENATE PRIORITY CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM. WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE L. A- IF THEY WOULD PRESENT. YES I BEEN TO ITEM SIX STILL POINT OF CLARIFICATION I DON'T FIVE AND MAY HAVE MISSPOKEN ON THE TALK TALK PLAN NUMBER IT'S TWENTY BILLION OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. AND SO FOR ITEMS SIX- THIS IS THE SENATE PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM FOR ALL FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS PROGRAM. THE SENATE PLAN PROPOSES LANGUAGE DIRECTED THE STATE TREASURER AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS PROGRAM. IN DETAIL AND 2% THAT PLAN BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THROUGH STATUTE IN TWENTY TWENTY TO. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS VERY GOOD I'D LIKE TO ASK THE- STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS TIM SCHAFER DEPUTY STATE TREASURER CAN YOU AND THE COMMITTEE HERE ME. OKAY WE CAN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT- HI OBVIOUSLY THE CONCEPTUAL PROPOSAL THAT- YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU- THENEED SO GREAT MORE DETAIL TO COMMENT AS TO THE FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OF IT. WHAT I WOULD OBSERVE- AS PART OF THIS OFFICE IS THAT- THE CALIFORNIA STATE TREASURY INVESTS BORROWS AND INTERACTS WITH THE PAYMENT SYSTEM. IN WAYS THAT MOST OTHER STATE AGENCIES DO NOT WE WOULD OBSERVE THAT. I'M DOING THIS KIND OF PROGRAM. MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WOOD- B. AFTER YOU SIGNIFICANT. MANEUVER BY CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS IT SAYS A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE NOTION OF TAX CREDITS AND OR RETOOLING OF EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE. MADAM CHAIR THAT EXISTED CAL HFA WHERE- I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING WITH YOU ON THE ON THE BOARD A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THE CONCEPT AS I UNDERSTAND IT FROM. THE SENATE. IS TO CREATE A HYBRID OF- THE A SERVICEMAN'S READJUSTMENT ACT OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE GI BILL WHICH IN ADDITION TO. EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS ALSO CREATED WHAT WE NOW KNOW TODAY IS VETERANS LOANS. SO A VERY INTENSE THAT. MELDED WITH A PHENOMENON THAT WE OBSERVE OCCURRED IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND NINETEEN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN INTEREST RATES WERE VERY HIGH BACK FUNDAMENTAL IS KNOWN AS A SHARED APPRECIATION MORTGAGE. AND WOULD COUPLE THAT WITH A PROGRAM OPERATED- PRESENTLY BY- CAL HSA AND MANY OTHER STATES IN THE FORM OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE- WE EXPECT THAT- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCH A PROGRAM WOULD BE HIGHLY LIKELY TO REQUIRE THE UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION. BETWEEN THE STATE AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISES TO AVOID. EXPOSING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS TO SOME OF THE FINANCIAL RISKS THAT MAY BE INHERENT WHILE STILL PRESERVING. THE BENEFITS. TO BE CLEAR- I AM NOT A MEMBER OF THE BAR SO I DON'T PRACTICE LAW BUT I WOULD FULLY EXPECT. THAT THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE LEGAL ISSUES THAT WOULD COME BEFORE THE STATE AND HELPING THIS PROGRAM- THAT MAY BE BEYOND STATUTORY MIGHT EVEN BE CONSTITUTIONAL BUT NEVER THE LAST. AS I'VE EXPRESSED TO THE PRO TEM'S OFFICE- AND TO SEVERAL INDIVIDUAL SENATE OFFICES. LEAVE THAT THAT IS NOT- THAT IS NOT A REASON TO- SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS I'M DOABLE BUT RATHER TO JUST BE IT IT SPEAKS FOR A DEGREE OF CAUTION AND A HIGH DEGREE OF THOUGHT IN A PROCEEDING WITH THAT. WHAT WE CAN OBSERVE AS FINANCIAL PEOPLE IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE IS THAT THIS IS. HIGHLY LIKELY TO PRODUCE SOME A SIGNIFICANT- IMPROVEMENT IN THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING IN OUR STATE IS. THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND- THE TREASURE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING- WORKING WITH OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE STATE- TO STANDING- THE PROGRAM UP AFTER CAREFUL STUDY THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOUR THE- MERCED THE COMMITTEE HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SURGERIES- AN ISSUE THAT- I HAD SOME CONCERN ABOUT- IT'S ALWAYS HARDER TO STAND UP A NEW PROGRAM THAN IT IS TO USE ONE THAT ALREADY EXISTS- ED BAND SO I'M I'M MINDFUL OF THE. NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP BUT A NEW PROGRAM THAT IS THAT IS ROLE WILL ENTAIL AN INVESTMENT A PRIVATE EQUITY OR PRIVATE CAPITAL IN ORDER TO GET IT GOING AND I'M I'M WONDERING- SINCE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH- WITH KELLY CHIPPED A AND WE DID WE DID SIT ON THE BOARD TOGETHER AND- AND PART OF THE REASON THAT CAL HFA DOES DO A FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ROGRAM WAS BECAUSE OF THE ROBUST CONVERSATION OF THE BOARD. IN FAVOR OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST. HOME OWNERSHIP RATE. SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT ALL THE BENEFITTED THE GI BILL WAS LOST AFTER WORLD WAR TWO AND SO- WE WE'VE WE'VE GONE BACKWARDS IN AND IN THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO OWN A HOME IN THE STATE AND SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO. TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO THEIR OWN- UNIT WHETHER IT'S A CONDO OR A TOWNHOUSE OR AT AN ACTUAL- DETACHED UNIT IS REALLY IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THE COST IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE AND THE INCOME OF THE PURCHASERS IT IS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE SO THIS. THIS CONCEPT IS REALLY A GREAT CONCEPT BUT COULD YOU TELL ME- WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WOULD BE BETWEEN THE CALLOUS YOU'RE FAYE AND WHITE WHY WOULDN'T WE PUT THIS ACCOUNT YOUR FAITH IF THEY'VE GOT A PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY. WORKING SHE- WELL I GUESS I WOULD RESPECT IT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MADAM CHAIR I WOULD- I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THOSE IN REVERSE ORDER- BUT BUT TO FRAME MY RESPONSES I'D LIKE TO SAY THIS IS NOT. THIS IS NOT A PROGRAM THAT THE STATE TREASURER. SANTA ANA TERRITORIAL SENSE RATHER HER DIRECTION TO ME IS PART OF OUR STAFF IS TO ASSIST WHEREVER POSSIBLE WITH THE FINANCIAL ENGINEERING OF IT SO THAT TAKES ME TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION AND THAT IS CAL HSA. I SEE NO REASON WHY THIS COULDN'T EXISTED CAL H. AT FE I WOULD OBSERVE. THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. SHOULD BE LOOKED AT PRETTY CAREFULLY. IS WHETHER OR NOT THE ASSETS AND RESOURCES OF CALAIS TO FADE WOULD BE EXPOSED. TO ANY INCREMENTAL OR ADDITIONAL LOST. AS A RESULT OF THE PROJECT AT THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR- IF THERE IS A MECHANISM IN PLACE. TO FIRE WALL THE PUBLIC ASSETS CAL HFA THEN I WOULD SEE NO REASON WHY- YOU KNOW THAT THAT ALTERNATIVE SHOULDN'T BE IMAGINE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND THAT BECOMES. TO RESTRICTIVE TO CUMBERSOME- AND INSTEAD THE INTENT WOULD BE TO CREATE SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN THE STATE ITSELF AND THIS INVESTMENT ACTIVITY. IT MAY AGUE AGAINST HAVING IT TO. UNDER THE AGES OF HAVE KELLY TO SAY LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. THAT IS THE BEST EXAMPLE IMPERFECT AS IT MAY BE IT'S THE BEST EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE YOU AND THE COMMITTEE. IN THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS THE DECISION MADE TO- SECURITIZED- INCOMING- TOBACCO SETTLEMENT REVENUES FROM THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AMONG THE TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SEVENTH ST STE. BUT TO THE FIVE MAJOR TOBACCO COMPANIES. THIS REQUIRED THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY ESTABLISH. A COMPANY THE GOLDEN STATE TOBACCO SECURITIZATION CORPORATION. IN ORDER TO AVOID- POLLUTING IF YOU WELL- THE STATE'S OWN BALANCE SHEET WITH. WITH SOME OF THESE REVENUES. HOW IS IMPERFECT IS THAT IT MAY BE THAT IS- I THINK COULD BE A CLUE TO WHAT MAY BE REQUIRED HERE IF THAT CAN BE DONE SUCCESSFULLY WITH CAL HFA. WITHOUT VIOLATION OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS OR OR CREATING- CRADDICK IMPEDIMENT TO ACTUALLY GETTING THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR TO CALIFORNIANS CERTAINLY AS A TECHNICAL EXPERT I WOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THAT BUT I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS- I SHARE IT AND HE SIMPLY THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION YET BUT I HOPE I WAS ABLE TO AT LEAST SATELLITE. YES I THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE CONSERVE IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT PRECIADO VERY MUCH THANK YOU. SENATOR NELSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. EXCUSE MY FRUSTRATION WHICH WILL SHOW OVER IN MY COUNTENANCE BUT THIS IS THIS NEW INITIATIVE OF THE MINISTRATION OF STARTING OUT JUST LIKE MOST EVERYTHING ELSE. NOT PUT. NOT BREAK NOT FILLED WITH THE INGREDIENTS NEEDED NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT. ONE QUESTION THAT REALLY HOLES IN MY- IN MY MIND IS THE RULES EQUITY HERE. AS OUR SECOND MORTGAGE THAT THE STATE WOULD HOLD OR THE OF THE FINANCIAL UP AFTER THE WHOEVER THAT IS WHATEVER BUSINESS WHO HOLDS EQUITY. WHO DID THEY COME BACK ON. THE CHURCH CARE CORRECTLY- CHARACTERIZE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT- RATHER THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT THE STATE BE THE BEAR THE BURDEN. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE STATE BEARS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHAT DO I NEED. BEST EXAMPLE YEARS AGO NOT MANY A. HA HOMELESS ADVOCATES PERSON. AIM TO OUR COMMITTEE. AND WAS JUST SKATING WAY CONDEMNING. CHECK WHAT. SAYING YOU KNOW WE COULD BUILD. SHOCKERS FOR THESE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS FOR SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS. IF WE WERE ON BURDEN. FROM THE REGULATIONS. AND I DON'T THINK ANY OTHER THING I TO MOVE AHEAD IN THIS LEGISLATURE WITHOUT SOME KIND OF REFORM OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS SEES THE IMPEDE AND INFLATE ENORMOUSLY. THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU CANNOT TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT DEALING WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT MAKE THEM. CHAU ON AFFORDABLE. AND THAT DOES CONCERN ME. AND A GENTLEMAN LEGEND OF THE BUREAUCRATIC. IMPEDIMENTS THEY ARE SO MANY OF THEM. THEY'RE ALMOST INVISIBLE. WE'RE NOT GETTING A RESERVOIRS BUILT UNDER A BOND THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SIX YEARS LATER. BUREAUCRATIC IMPEDIMENTS. WE NEED TO LOOSEN UP ON SOME OF THAT AND AT LEAST LOOK AT IT CRITICALLY AND WHENEVER WE'RE GOING TO AND TRUST SOMEBODY TO OVERSEE THIS IT MUST BE RETURNED OVERSEEN AND IT MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE TO SOMEBODY AND I WOULD ARGUE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THAT ACCOUNTABLE AUTHORITY AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR- I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS- THIS ITEM IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM. AND SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. THE SENATE PRIORITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PACKAGE AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE L. A. OR IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT MR MORALIS. YES THANK YOU THE SENATE PLAN INCLUDES SEVERAL COMPONENTS INTENDED TO CREATE AND PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE ESTABLISHING FINANCES FINNCING TOOLS FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS CONSTRUCTION PROVIDING INCENTIVES TO CONVERT VACANT OR UNDER USED COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL SPACE INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ASSISTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NONPROFITS AND OTHER QUALIFIED BUYERS TO ACQUIRE FORECLOSED HOMES FOR USE AS HOUSING. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M ANY QUESTIONS OF MISS MORALIS ON THE SIDE OF. YES SENATOR NELSON I'M SURE I'LL BE VERY BRIEF BUT UNDERSTAFFED COMMENTS ON ON MY REPORTS HERE EVERYONE OF THESE BULLETS SHOULD BE EXAMINED. INCENTIVES TO CONVERT BACON NINETY YEARS COMMERCIAL RETAIL SPACE AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH OKAY HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. THE MERGING GRANTS LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS TO AVOID FORECLOSURE. HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM. FURNISHES TAXPAYERS AND REALLY FOR RENTERS. RUN TAX CREDIT FOR SECOND COME FROM. INCENTIVIZING EARTHQUAKE RETROFIT FEDERAL 75% FUNDS OKAY THAT'S SOME FEDERAL MONEY THERE BUT THE POINT BEING. THESE THINGS ARE NOT DECIDED YET AND WHERE WE ARE WELL THROUGH INTO THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THIS YEAR. AND THESE THINGS AND THESE QUESTIONS ARE ONLY NOW ASK BY THE CHAIR MYSELF AND WHATEVER MEMBERS OF YOU KNOW KIND OF THE COMMITTEES. I THINK WE'LL GET IN THE CAR WHERE FOR THE HEAD OF THE COURSE HERE FORTUNE WE BETTER SLOW DOWN AND GET IT RIGHT. AND SO FAR IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS RIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR NIELSEN- SO MY COMMENT ON THIS PARTICULAR- ISSUE THIS THIS IS PART OF THIS SAID SENATE PRIORITY PACKAGE AND- A NUMBER OF THESE ARE ARE A RESPONSE. OR IN RESPONSE TO BILLS THAT MEMBERS HAVE THAT ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT. BEHIND HOMELESSNESS AS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE AMONG CALIFORNIANS IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF HOUSING. AND I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. IS WHAT IT EXACERBATES THE HOMELESS SITUATION. AND THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THAT REGARD TO AND SO THE MORE UNITS THAT WE CAN BUILD. THE MORE WE CAN DEAL WITH. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE FACED THAT REALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE CORONA VIRUS. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT. THE CORONA VIRUS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT AND DETRIMENTALLY AFFECTED FAMILIES THAT LIVED IN OVERCROWDED HOUSING SITUATIONS AND THEY'RE LIVING IN OVERCROWDED HOUSING SITUATIONS NOT BECAUSE EIGHT. THEY WANT TO BUT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO RENT A UNIT ALL BY THEMSELVES IN FACT. THEY HAVE TO RENT A HOUSE OR AN APARTMENT AND THEN SUBLEASE ROOMS IN THAT HOUSE OR APARTMENT AS A WAY TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE RENT. FOR THE MORE UNITS WE CAN GT BUILT. ON THE BETTER. THE BETTER OUR COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE. AND THE LESS OVERCROWDING WILL HAVE AND- I DON'T EXPECTED THIS PANDEMIC IS GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL BE FACING IN THE FUTURE SO WE DESPERATELY NEED TO BUILD. BILL HOUSING AND WE'RE LOOKING. EXPEDITING THE OPPORTUNITY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH EIGHTY USE ARE USING COMMERCIAL RETAIL PROPERTY- TRYING TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THIS IS IT THIS IS INNOVATIVE AND NOVEL AND- IT IT DOES NEED SOME MORE WORK THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT AS THESE BILLS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY BRING THEM TO FRUITION IS GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SO I THINK THIS IS A- REALLY IMPORTANT. REALLY IMPORTANT ITEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO I EXPECT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS BACK AGAIN SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. HOUSING LAW ASSISTANCE AND- EGGMAN ASK H. CD IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THIS. HELLO MAKING ME FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING NEEDS MADE ABOUT MEANT THAT. HAPPENED A LOT. OF ALL. AND IT IS A REQUEST FOR SIX POSITION- GROW WORKING WE'RE DOING IN THAT STATE NOW AND WE AND WE HAVE A- OR AMPLE AREAS HOUSING LAW- AND- WE START. FRAME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE ARE REALIZING INCREDIBLY INTENSIVE- WORK AND WE WANT THAT AND WE ARE NOT KEEPING UP WITH THE DEMAND AND WE WANT TO REALLY CONTINUE TO GROW THAT EXPLOSIVE. AND SHORTER FICTION BACK BUYING- WITH ALIVE- GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO HELP GET THEM THERE- AND THAT THIS- REQUEST WILL HAVE A POINT. WHAT'S THAT THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH THE DEPARTMENT OF FIND YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO. DINNERS ARE COMING UP ON ITS NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. BRIGAND ARMS WILL NOT HAVE A DISCUSSION OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SENATOR NELSON. IF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HERE AGAIN IT'S ORGANIZATIONAL AND THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL. AND ALL I SEE HERE. MORE QUESTIONS. AND FEW MORE ANSWERS. IS H. THREE D. THE RIGHT PLACE I DON'T KNOW. USUALLY WE THROW IT IN SEVERAL PLACES AND DAVE CONFLICT. COMPETE OR GET CONFUSED. AND I SHOOT NO CLARITY HERE WITH THE HOUSING LAW ASSISTANT- HOW AND WHAT FORM RESEARCH ASSISTANCE GOING TO TAKE ARE WE GOING TO HAVE. REAL ESTATE MINDED PEOPLE GOING IN AND TALKING TO THE HOMELESS ABOUT HOW THEY TRANSITION INTO SOME MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. OR NO THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. IN VERY RARE CASES BUT HOW THEN THE SUCH A HOMELESS PERSON TRANSITION TO PREPARE THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE OF THAN A CHOIR. THE DISTRIBUTION EQUITY IN SOME KIND OF HOUSING STRUCTURE. AGAIN I THINK WE'RE STILL IN DOWN THE TRACK OF JUST THROWING MORE MONEY AT IT AS LONG AS WE DO THAT I'M GOING TO BE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN I'M JUST THERE BY WAY OF CLARIFICATION I THINK THIS PARTICULAR ITEM HAS TO DO WITH EACH CD. ASSISTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT- AND- FROM FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANNA. SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THIS IS A NEW OFFICE WAS UP. FOR TO READ. AND IT WAS IT WAS A- SEEN AS A MEASURE BE USE CONSEQUENCE IN LOCAL FOR. DOING THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO- TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BE ABLE TO GET. THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT STATE LAW IS AND WHAT THEIR REQUIREMENTS IN A QUICKER MENTION OBLIGATIONS ARE SO FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE INSTANCE THAT I AM I HAD. OCCASION TO GET INVOLVED IN WAS A COMMUNITY WHO HAD APPROVED A HOUSING PROJECT AND THEN. BASICALLY DRAG THEIR FEET IN ISSUING PERMITS AND THEY YOU KNOW EVERY DELAY. IN ISSUING PERMITS TIME IS MONEY. AND SO THEY THEY WERE. THEY WERE BEING HELD UP. IN THEIR FINAL OCCUPANCY BECAUSE OF A DISAGREEMENT OVER A FENCE. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WHERE YOU GOT THAT'S MINISTERIAL YOU MAY WANT TO DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT SET BACKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE JUST GETTING THAT FENCE UP IS JUST. SHOULDN'T HOLD UP- THE OCCUPANCY PERMITS AND SO EIGHT EIGHT CD WAS INVOLVED AND THEY WERE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE IT I AM. A AT RETURN TO SANITY IF YOU WELL AND EVERYTHING WAS ABLE TO MOVE. THE EXPEDITIOUSLY AND PEOPLE MOVED INTO THE APARTMENT THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEEDED AND THAT THEY HAD BEEN WAITING FOR SO. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT- ABOUT APPROVAL APPROVAL OF PROJECTS AND WHICH REQUIRED AND HOW TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YES SO THAT. ONCE ONCE IT AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS APPROVED. A PROJECT OR- ONCE THEY HAVE THE RULES IN PLACE ABOUT HOW THE PROJECT SHOULD PROCEED THAT THEY FOLLOW THOSE RULES THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT SO- I THINK. THIS IS A REAL IMPORTANT. PROGRAM WITHIN EACH CD AND I AND I APPRECIATE. THEIR HARD WORK AND- ONE IS I WANT TO SUPPORT THEM IN IN IN THE REQUEST FOR RESOURCES- SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ACTION ON THIS ITEM AT THE END OF THE HEARING- SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE WHICH IS THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM PROPOSITION ONE REALLOCATION. AND I AGAIN I'D LIKE TO ASK EACH CD IF THEY'D LIKE TO PRESENT. GERMANY VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M MARK JEREMY SYSTEM DEPUTY DIRECTOR.
