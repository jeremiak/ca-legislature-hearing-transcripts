AFTERNOON AT FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT AT STARTING THIS MEETING A BIT DELAYED BY AN HOUR. WE ARE LIVING IN INTERESTING TIMES AS YOU ALL KNOW AND- THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON AT BEST PRACTICES FOLLOWING HAPPENED APARTMENT A PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES IN VERY FOCUS ON THAT- THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. HERE WITH OPERATIONS IN THE LEGISLATURE SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE- IN REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND AS SINCERELY APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE DELAY- ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE WE WELCOME YOU. TO THIS LONG STANDING TRADITION OF THE FORTY SEVENTH ANNUAL ZEKE GRADER FISHERIES FORM HI MY NAME IS AT MIKE WEIR OF HONOR TO BE ABLE TO CHAIR- THIS- ESTEEM COULD BE ALONG WITH OUR VICE CHAIR SOME NUMBER STONE WHO HAS BEEN JUST SO SOLID ISSUES OF FISHERIES AND REALLY BEFORE. PART WE WORKING WITH. WHEN WE Q. I TO ALL OF ON TO IS FROM NIGHT. MANY OF YOU ARE HERE. AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR WORKING IN IT THE WHAT MASON. BOUNTY FROM. I TOOK AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF WORK WE DO WANT TO SAY HOW APPRECIATIVE WE ARE OF YOUR HARD WORK- IN YOUR GENEROSITY THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS- YESTERDAY EVENING IS A GREAT EVENT. THIS AFTERNOON WE WANT TO WELCOME ALL FISHERMEN WHO TRAVELED FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE THAT TO BE A TO BE WITH US IN THIS TIME HONORED TRADITION IN IN THESE CHALLENGING TIMES. FOR NEARLY ABSENT EAT. CALIFORNIA IS FISH SPECIFIC A ORGANIZATION AND SO. COUNCIL AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FISHERMEN COME TOGETHER. TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IN ANNUAL REPORT. AND THAT REPORT IS VOCAL FOCUS ON THE GOALS IN ANNUAL ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS- IN IT HAS BEEN A BUSY YEAR SINCE THE LAST TIME WE ALL MET. IN IT'S BEEN A BUSY YEAR FOR THE FLEET. WE HEARD FROM EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU IN THIS AUDIENCE TODAY ABOUT THE NEED FOR DISASTER RELIEF AND- FINDING IN SOME GOOD NEWS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO DIRECTOR BONTA FOR HIS ADVOCACY AND- ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE HERE TODAY. WE FINALLY SAW DISBURSEMENT THE FUNDING FOR THE CRAB FISHERY- AND AT FUNDS WERE SECURED FOR SALMON SARDINES INTERACTIONS- WE ARE NOT DONE WITH THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS. I EIGHT IN NO THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WHO ARE HERE WITH US WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ADVOCACY. IT HAS BEEN 1% ALSO BEEN. STATION IN THE LAST YEAR WE'VE ENACTED LEGISLATION FOR THE FISHERY A REACHED SALMON STEELHEAD HOW I HAVE HOW THE WHALES CUCUMBERS IS A NUMBERS FAVOR MARICULTURE AQUACULTURE AS WELL AS PROTECTING THE INDUSTRY FROM EXCESSIVE LANDING FEES AND MORE I IN THE DIRECTOR AND I ARE GLAD THAT THAT IS OVER AT MY RIGHT MISTER DIRECTOR THAT OUR RIGHT THERE AGAIN. GOOD TIMES- BUT LOOK HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. WE STILL HAVE CHALLENGES AHEAD. I THIS SEASON WERE SUFFERING FROM TO DROUGHTS. ONE IMPOSED BY THE WEATHER. IN ONE OF THE HANDS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP POUR WATER MANAGEMENT. CAN KILL MORE THAN 95% OF OUR BABY SANDING. AND ALONG WITH LOW RAINFALL THESE CONDITIONS CAN CREATE A PERFECT STORM. OF SALMON KILLING EVENTS. AND WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION RULES THAT HAVE JUST BEEN RELEASED. THESE LIMITATIONS ON WATER DRAMATICALLY IMPACT- THE SALMON FISHERY IN ITS CAN IMPACT OUR ECONOMY. FROM CALIFORNIA ALL THE WAY TO THE GREAT COUNTRY OF CANADA. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT LAST SEASON WAS ONE OF OUR BASS SALMON SEASONS IN DECADS AND THIS DECISION BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THESE DANGERS NEW RULES WILL HAVE DEVASTATING IMACTS ABOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN AS WELL AS THE SACRAMENTO. WATERSHEDS OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU. HERE ABOUT THE ISSUES AND TO BE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE PRECARIOUS STATE OF OUR FISHERIES AND EDUCATE THE LEGISLATURE RESIDENTS ABOUT YOUR STATUS- AND AGAIN WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOU TAKE THE TIME. I DO WE HAVE TO BE HERE TODAY BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO OUR ALL STAR LINE UP A PANELIST LIKE TO BETTER TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO VICE CHAIRMAN STONE WE'RE GONNA WELCOME. BOTH THE SECTARIAN AFTER RESOURCES BECOME FORTIES WELL AS A DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AT THIS TIME. WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP CIRCUITS YOU. THANK YOU VERY HAPPY HERE UPON APPRECIATE THE JUST FOR. OVER THE LAST YEAR AND CALM. AND THEN THIS FIX THE MIDWEST THE PACK. THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORT DURING A- THOROUGH CLEANING IS THAT WE- THE THINGS THAT ARE FOR. BUT I WANT TO THE FISHERMEN WHO SHE- LAST NIGHT. ABOUT OF THAT WAS A FAB. DINNER AND AS PROMISE THEN. IN TRADE FOR THAT WE MAKE YOU COME AND SIT THROUGH A LONG HERE AFTERNOON. THIS IS WHAT THAT'S WHAT YOU DO THIS IS WHAT WE DO IS SIT THROUGH LONG HEARINGS. BUT ALSO IN THAT. HAVEN'T GONE TO A NUMBER OF THOSE FEES WE DID NOTICE THAT THERE WAS FAR LESS CRAP THAT WE'D SEEN BEFORE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE GREAT NEW SHOOTERS. AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE WE WERE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THESE FISHERIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CRABS. THE SEA URCHINS SEEN THE LOSS OF CAL SEEN THE DRAMATIC CHANGES HAPPENING IN OUR OCEANS. SO WE SEE REFLECTED ON THE DINNER TABLE LAST NIGHT. ALWAYS REMINDERS OF WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE WORKING FOR AND TRYING TO SOLVE HERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS ON THE NET TO THE CELL MONADS. AND THE HABITAT ISSUES THAT THEY REPRESENTS. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL WAY INSIDE WE ABSOLUTELY CAN CRASH THAT FISHERY ON THE OCEAN SIDE AND IS A- MEMBER OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THAT OUR SECRETARY. IS THE- IS THE CHAIRPERSON OF WE PUT OUT A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT OCEANS POLICY THAT. A FOR THE FOR THE FIRST TIME REALLY IN A LONG TIME COMBINES A NOTION OF WHAT HAPPENS ON SHORE AND ITS EFFECTS OFF SHORE AND THESE ARE FIGHTS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING OF FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE FISHERIES RELY ON WATER QUALITY HABITATS AND OTHER THINGS. DEEP INTO CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A SUSTAINABLE AND LARGE FISHERY OFF OF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN NEVER FORGET THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT'S- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. WITH FEDERAL WATER POLICIES BUT WE ALL APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT YOU HAVE ALL GONE THROUGH THE FOR THE FISHING INDUSTRY THE FLEET HAS GONE THROUGH. TRIED ADVOCATE FOR AND BE A PART OF BUILDING SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS OUR COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PANELS AND LAYING OUT. THE PATH AHEAD. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR IN AGAIN WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP ISN'T GENERALLY NOW LIKELY TO ADVANCE THEIR FIRST PANEL THIS IS GOING TO BE FOCUS ON REMARKS FROM BOTH. A THE SECRETARY AFTER RESOURCES CITY CALIFORNIA WAY CROWFOOT ALONG WITH THE FULL BRIEFING FROM TRUCK BONHAM DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LIFE. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE DIRECTOR HE'S THE LONGEST SERVING DIRECTOR IN THE DEPARTMENT'S HISTORY- AND- WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE- IN. REGULATION SIR IN THAT IT'S TRUE THE A MILESTONE IN E LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH YOU HERE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. BUT MR CROWFOOT IS GOING TO BE KICKING US OFF AND THIS GROWTH IT IS A SECTION NOW TO RESOURCES IN HE'S ONTINUE WITH THIS LONG STANDING TRADITION OF KICKING OFF THIS. FORUM AND HE'S GONNA BE PROVIDING THE PRIORITIES- FOR TWENTY TWENTY FOR FISHERIES INCLUDING THE MINISTRATIONS PLAN FOR FLOWS FOR SALMON IN LIGHT OF THE- BIOLOGICAL OPINION THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP WHICH WE NOW. MINISTRATION AS DEEP CONCERN OVER IN ONE TAKE A MOMENT. TO SAY THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING FOR OUR AND DANGEROUS SHE I AM BOTH DOCUMENTS AND- IT'S GONNA BE FOCUSING. THREE SEPARATE. SALMON AND THEN LASTLY HOW WE CAN EXPEDITE THE FEATHER RIVER TO REALLY DOES SEEM AN RESTORATION PROJECTS THE FLOOR IS YOURS HIS SECRETARY AGAIN I WANT TO SINCERELY APOLOGIZE ABOUT DELAYING BOTH YOU AND I ARE ALL OF OUR PANELISTS IN THOSE WERE HERE TODAY WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE SIR I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A- TIME CERTAIN THAT YOU NEED TO GET TO IS WELL- ON A CORONAVIRUS. CALLS ALL TURN THE FLOOR OVER YOU SIR AND WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT FOR YOUR TENANTS THANKS SO MUCH GERMAN WIRE AND AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE IT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOUR PRIOR- PRIORITIES THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE HOLDING THIS GIVE AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. BIG THANKS TO TOM ALSO FOR ORGANIZING THIS I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS MY SECOND THIS WILL BE MY SECOND HEARING ANNUAL HEARING IT WAS MY SECOND TOO MANY TO JOIN. ON THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE THAT ARE FISHING IN OUR STATE- LAST NIGHT AND I HAVE TO SAY IT IS. REALLY RIP VALUABLE THAT WE HAVE THEM COME DOWN SACRAMENTO IN CASES YOU KNOW TRAVELING FROM PLACES LIKE CRESCENT CITY OVER SIX OURS TO BE HERE I ALWAYS ENJOY HIT THE I BARNETT PERSPECTIVE OF THE MEN THAT ARE ACTUALLY THERE ON THE WALL OUR- THING FROM WHAT THEY THINK UP INNOVATE. IS FOR THE- FISH A- TWO. BE I THAT. THE INTAKE WORKING. ON CRAP WHALE IT CETERA SO. IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AND ME THAT IT NEW LEADERS TO I WAS EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO MEET MISTER BRAD SHAW WHO WHO TAKES OVER LEADERSHIP OF A PC FFA AND THEN OF COURSE ROTH SINGLE BY THE NO OPPENHEIM WHO'S BEEN- KEY STAFF LEADER THERE. SO IT'S A IT'S A REALLY VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY HUGE THANKS TO YOU OFFER SPEARHEADING IT EVERY YEAR- YOU ASKED A LOT OF VERY GOOD DIRECT QUESTIONS OF ME AND YOU WANT ME TO COVER IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO I PREPARED A POWER POINT PRESENTATION- MY GOAL IS TO BE AS DIRECT AS POSSIBLE ANSWERING ALL THOSE QUESTIONS AND OF COURSE I WELCOME. HI THE ANY FOLLOW UP AND YOU HAVE. SO FIRST UP WAS ASKING ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND I TALK A LOT ABOUT- FOUR PILLARS THAT. THAT WAKE ME UP EVERY MORNING. AND FROM TOP LEFT- THE FIRST PRIORITY IS CLIMATE RESILIENCE. AND I CALL THAT PROTECTING PEOPLE IN NATURE FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. NOW WE KNOW WE CAN'T STOP THOSE IMPACTS OF BUT WE CAN HELP OUR NATURAL PLACES AND OUR COMMUNITIES- WHETHER THESE CHANGES AND ADAPT TO THESE CHANGES. SO IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS HEARING IT'S ALL ABOUT BUILDING THE RESILIENCE OF OUR FISHERIES TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE- FOR. DECADES TO COME. THAT PICTURE I IN TOP LEFT CORNER IS ACTUALLY THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. PUTTING. THROUGH THE SALMON RESTORATION PROGRAM WHICH IS A FORTY YEAR PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THAT CONSERVATION CORPS AND- THE- NOT PART OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THE SECOND PRIORITY IS PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY WILL TALK A LOT TODAY ABOUT ENDANGERED SPECIES OF FISH. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. KEEPING SPECIES ALIVE THAT ARE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE AT THE STATE CAN DO MUCH MORE UPSTREAM. TO KEEP PLANTS AND ANIMALS ARE HEALTHY SO THAT THEY AREN'T. ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION- MANY DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE MORE VARIETY. MORE DIVERSITY OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE- WORLD'S BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS. AND SO I AM FOCUSED ON TRYING TO. RESHAPE A LOT OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON HOW DO WE MAINTAIN. THIS WE NOW I WOULD EVER BE. THE PROPERTY IS. FOR ALL. AND YOU HEAR THE GOVERNOR TALK ABOUT IT. WHEN YOU'RE- ALL STAR FOR. IN RESIDENTS CAN CAN ACTUALLY SHARE IN. THE SERVER. I THINK THAT MANIFESTS OUR AGENCY. IN THEM CALIFORNIANS CAN ACTUALLY GET OUT I NEED. OUR STATE PARKS ARE NATURAL RESERVES SO WE'RE FOCUSED. ON THAT AND YOU'LL SEE MORE ABOUT. THAT IN COMING YEARS. AND THEN. SLEEP ON AND NEVER WERE CALLING CUTTING THE GREEN. WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY. PROJECT IN OUR MENTOR. PROJECT IMPROVE. HAPPEN AT. OF THESE. I'M ON MORE QUICKLY THE FACT. THAT I LEARNED FIRST YEAR BEING TERRY IS WE- ON FOR ENVIRONMENT ADDRESS. IN SOMETIMES THIRD OF THE PROJECT BUDGET IS ON PLAY AND PER. AND IT TAKES YOU. TO DO A SORT OF A TEMPLATE ED- STREAM RESTORATION PROJECT OR OR A WETLAND RESTORATION PROJECTS SO WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON. HOW CAN WE HELP GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL THINGS HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY. SO WE'RE YOU KNOW YOU ASKED ME TO FOCUS ON OUR WORK ON SALMON ARE AS A SPECIFIC FOCUS WITHIN OUR FISHERIES WORK AND I WANTED TO JUST SHARE WITH YOU A GRAPH THAT THE- MEN AND WOMEN. BEHIND ME NO TO WELL WHICH IS. WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US THIS IS THE LONG TERM DECLINE IN OUR SALMON POPULATIONS SO ON THE LEFT- IS- THE BASELINE AVERAGE FROM NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND ON THE pFROM NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND EACH OF THOSE LINES ARE REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SALMON. AND WHAT WE SEE IS ANYWHERE FROM- 43% DECLINE I OVER THAT FIFTY YEARS TO UPWARDS OF 90% I AND SO I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT- THE HEALTH OF OUR SALMON FISHERIES IS MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I THINK OUR GOAL HAS TO BE- TO PIVOT. I AND TO RESTORETHE FISHERY. YOU ASKED ABOUT A- UPDATE TO THE SALMON DOUBLING GOAL THAT WE ARE PROPOSING- WITHIN THIS DISCUSSION OF ALLEN TERRY AGREEMENTS- AND IT IS SPECIFICALLY TO DOUBLE- THE AMOUNT OF SALMON FROM THAT BASS LINE- BY TWENTY FIFTY- YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW THAT- THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IMPROVEMENT ACT. ARE REQUIRED THAT THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR DEVELOP A PROGRAM TO MAKE ALL EASONABLE EFFORTS TO DOUBLE THE POPULATION. THAT BASELINE POPULATION BY TWO THOUSAND TWO. BUT OBVIOUSLY THE STATE. MOVED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SO FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN A SALMON DOUBLING GOAL THAT SORT OF FLOATING OUT THERE IN THE ETHER WITHOUT A DATE TO TARGET TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO. IMAGINE A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOAL THAT SAID 50% OF- REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PERIOD. WELL THE QUESTION IS BY WHEN AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY ESTABLISH A PLAN WITHOUT OR TARGET WITHOUT A DATE. SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE TWENTY FIFTY IS AMBITIOUS GIVEN THAT- SHARP INCLINE IN THE FACT THAT WE AFTER INVERT- THE TRAJECTORY. BUT WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT'S DOABLE AND IT GIVES US A THIRTY YEAR WINDOW- ON WHICH TO DEVELOP A PLAN I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY WERE BULLISH ON VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND WE THINK THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WHICH- AS DISCUSSED ARE FIFTEEN YEARS AND LÏNG. ARE ACTUALLY WOULD WOULD MOVE US- BACK UP THE TRAJECTORY TOWARD THAT THAT DOUBLING GOAL I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO DEPTH. ON THAT. SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE NEED TO RECOVER OUR SALMON POPULATIONS GOES WITHOUT SAYING WE HAVE TO RESTORE FLOWS IN RIVERS IN THE BAY DELTA I THINK EVERYBODY FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE I IN THE ON THE SPECTRUM OF WATER STAKEHOLDERS AGREES ON THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS I IMPROVING AND EXPANDING HABITAT WE'VE LOST- MUCH OF OUR- SALMON SPAWNING IN REARING HABITAT- OVER THE YEARS WERE INCREASINGLY MOVING WATER THROUGH THESE THESE CHANNELIZED RIVERS THAT HAVE LOST THAT THEIR NATURAL FLOWS- WE NEED TO- PRIORITIZE APPROPRIATE DAM REMOVALS INCLUDING THE KLAMATH RIVER DAMS. AND BARRIERS TO FISH PASSAGE WHICH STRUCK COULD TALK MORE ABOUT WE NEED TO CONTROL INVASIVE SPECIES OBVIOUSLY CONTROVERSIAL THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH INVASIVE SPECIES LIKE STRIPED BASS ARE ACTUALLY- IMPACTING SALMON POPULATIONS BUT I THINK WE RIGHT I RECOGNIZE THAT CONTROLLING THOSE POPULATIONS IS ONE THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE ALSO HAVE TO IMPROVE OCEAN CONDITIONS WE'LL TALK A LOT TODAY ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR RIVERS BUT WE KNOW ON THE SAM AND I REALIZE ON THEHEALTH OF OUR FRESH WATER ECOSYSTEMS AND ARE OCEAN BASED ECOSYSTEMS. I'M REALLY EXCITED WITH THE- STRATEGY FOR OCEANS AND COAST THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND- MYSELF AND THE OCEAN PROTECTION- COUNCIL JUST APPROVED WHICH ACTUALLY HAS. A BUNCH OF INVESTMENTS IN PRIORITIES TO IMPROVE OCEAN BIG. BASS WE ALSO NEED TO. UTILIZE BETTER NEW ACTIONABLE SCIENCE WE SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SCIENCE- OF THE HEALTH OF OUR WATERWAYS INCLUDING FISHERIES BUT TOO OFTEN IT'S WHAT I CALL COME COMPLIANCE SCIENCE OR WORSE YET COMBAT SCIENCE WHAT WE NEED IS- SCIENTIFIC MONITORING AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT IS TRANSPARENT AND THEN INFORMS ARE MANAGEMENT WHICH HAS TO BE ADAPTIVE WE CAN'T LOCK OURSELVES IN THE THESE DECADE OLD MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND MANAGED THROUGH. REGULATORY DECISIONS THAT GET CHANGED ONCE A DECADE OR LITIGATION THAT TAKES FIFTEEN YEARS TO GET DONE WE HAVE TO WORK TO UTILIZE THE BEST CIENCE AN ADAPTIVELY MANAGE TOWARDS RECOVER OF THESE THESE SPECIES. AND THEN LASTLY I'LL SAY YOU KNOW WE ARE REALLY PRIORITIZING THAT THE PROMISE OF COLLABORATION- I THINK WE'LL HEAR A LOT OF PERSPECTIVE TODAY ABOUT THEY WERE THE ROLE OF LITIGATION AND OBVIOUSLY LITIGATION HOUSE A ROLE IN PROTECTING OUR FISHERIES. BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IF WE CAN ULTIMATELY TRANSCEND LITIGATION AND CREATE SOME TYPE OF DURABLE- A SET OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS THAT RESTORES FISHERIES AND MEETS OTHER NEEDS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT. SO WE'LL TALK TODAY ABOUT WHEN I CALL TWO DISTINCT BUT OVER OVERLAPPING PROCESS SEES THAT ARE IMPACTING THE SALMON FISHERY. ON THE LEFT YOU HAVE- WHAT I CALL THE BAY DELTA PUMPING RULES OR THEY DON'T TO INFRASTRUCTURE RULES- THAT EXISTS TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES. SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS BUT I ALWAYS LIKE TO TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN BECAUSE THAT'S CONFUSES PEOPLE SO THIS IS REALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE RULES THAT GET PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES- AND THOSE ARE RULES THAT ARE REQUIRED BOTH BY OUR FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND OUR STATE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WHICH WE KNOW OF AS SEASIDE. AND OUT OF US HAS OF COURSE RESULTED IN AN UPDATED BIOLOGICAL OPINION. THAT UPDATE WAS DIRECTED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP- IN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND REYES. TURNS WITHIN OUR ADMINISTRATION CERTAINLY THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION AS WELL- BASED ON THE WAY THAT THE PRESIDENT- DIRECTED THAT UPDATE. I E. ON IT LET US NOT TO TAKE AN EXTRAORDINARY ACTION WHICH IS TO DECIDE THAT WE CAN NO LONGER RELY ON THE FEDERAL. RULES THAT FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINION. TO COVER OUR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE UNDER OUR STATE IN YOUR SPEECHES ACT. SO WE IN ESSENCE- BEGAN DOWN A PARALLEL PATH- SCIENCE BASED INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF WHAT RIPPLES NEED IT OUR E. W. R. INFRASTRUCTURE. ABIDE OR COMPLY WITH OUR EIGHT INJURES BECAUSE ACT SEASIDE. SO MY OF THE DISCUSS. THAT YOU HEARD ON THE FEDERAL. OPINION IT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS HAS BEEN OUR CONTENTION THAT THEY ARE NOT PROTECTIVE ENOUGH. AND OF THAT- WE ARE. WE ARE CREATING A SET OF RULES THAT ARE DIFFERENT. AND WE IN THE FALL EXPLAINED THAT OUR PROBLEMS WERE. CLEAR ENOUGH WITH THAT THE- PROPOSED BIOLOGICAL OPINION THAT IF NEEDED WE WOULD FILE LITIGATION. WE HAD CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR FEDERAL AGENCY PARTNERS IN RECENT MONTHS BUT DIDN'T REACH RESOLUTION AND SO OBVIOUSLY BE FILED THAT- LITIGATION. THE SAME TIME CHALK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ARE FINALIZING A STATE PERMIT THIS INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT- THAT WILL. ENABLE ACCOMPLI DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURES OPERATIONS COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUN SO THAT'S ONE. THE OTHER IS- OF COURSE PROTECTING THE BENEFICIAL USES OF. OUR OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER SYSTEM IN ALL OF ITS TRIBUTARY IS THE SAN JOAQUIN AND THE BAY DELTA OF COURSE WHICH THOSE TO RIVER SYSTEMS FLOW INTO. AND FRANKLY THE STATE IS- DECADE VERDUGO UP TODAY IT PLAN TO ACTUALLY OPPORTUNITY BENEFICIAL USES IN THOSE RIVERS WHICH INCLUDES. ON THE AND HEALTH OF THE RIVER BUT I WE CAN. ACTIVITY RAY. WATER CA AT STORE. APPS UNDER THE PORTER ACT NOW AS YOU KNOW I'VE CHAIR IN THIS MEMBER THERE HAS. A RACE. PROCESS WAS A NEW. A COUPLE FEW YEARS AGO- THAT WOULD REQUIRE ON IMPAIR FLOW IN THOSE THIS. ARE TO DO TELL. AND WE HAVE FOCUSING OF ART GEN ON. I WANT TO BE AGREE. YEAH THE BOMBING I'M SURE THERE STAND THEY WERE BE A LEGALLY ENFORCED SET OF. ARE TO IN THE HEALTH OF THOSE WATER WAYS AS A PLAN OF IMPLEMENTATION- FOR THAT REGULATORY ACTION. AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THOSE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS ARE. SO SECRETARY BLUMENFELD FROM CALLIE PA AND I GUESS LAST MONTH- LAID OUT WHAT WE THINK IS A LEGALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY ADEQUATE FRAMEWORK FOR A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT. AGAIN YOU GO BACK TO THAT A WAY TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THAT THAT STATE. LAW REQUIRED UPDATE OF- THE BAY DELTA PLAN. AND JUST THE BROAD BRUSH- ELEMENTS OF IT IS- EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF NEW WATER AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THAT IS NEW WATER THAT CANNOT BE ERODED BY LET'S SAY REDUCED WATER EXPORTS FROM THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION SO REALLY FOCUSED ON. AT ALMOST A MILLION ACRE FEET OF NEW FLOWS COMPARED TO EXISTING CONDITIONS. ARE CALLING FOR THE RESTORATION OF OVER SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OF HABITAT- THAT'S AS I UNDERSTAND IT ALMOST- TAKING THE YOLO BYPASS AND MULTIPLYING IT BY ABOUT- A ONE POINT TWO FIVE THAT'S THE AMOUNT A HABITAT THAT WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE PART OF THIS- THAT WOULD AND THAT. THIS AGREEMENT WOULD GENERATE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW INVESTMENT SHARED BY WATER USERS WHO FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH A SOUTH THEMSELVES FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS STATE GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN IMPORTANT AS I MENTIONED ACTUALLY A PORTION OF THAT GOING TO NEW COLLABORATIVE SCIENCE THAT WOULD BE GOVERNED BY- A TRANSPARENT COLLECTION OF ENTITIES MY VISION IS IT WOULD INCLUDE WATER USERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION GROUPS AND FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. TO ACTUALLY- DETERMINE WHAT SCIENCE IS NEEDED AND USE THAT ALONG WITH MONITORING TO ADAPTIVELY MANAGE THOSE NEW FLOWS AND THAT ADDED HABITAT HABITAT. WE THINK THAT THIS ACTUALLY EXPANDS THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO BRING BACK SALMON AND OTHER FISH POPULATIONS SO YOU YOU SAW MY LIST OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND IN THE INCLUDED NOT JUST FLOW BUT HAVE TACK AND ADAPTIVE. AND SO THIS COMMENTARY AGREEMENT FRAMEWORK WE THINK ACTUALLY CAN BRING THOSE TOOLS IN A WAY THAT THE SIMPLE WATER BOARD REGULATION BUT SIMPLY CONTROL THE LEVER ON FLOWS CANNOT. IMPORT WE BELIEVE THE BALLING AGREEMENT HAS PROMISED TO ACTUALLY COME INTO A FACT IN SHORT ORDER REALLY IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS IS IT REQUIRES- ONE THAT THAT THAT REGULATORY PROCESS THE WATER BOARD- WILL. WILL WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE SECONDLY- ESSENTIALLY THE- AMENDMENT OF WATER RIGHTS IN THE ADJUDICATION OF WATER RIGHTS AND I AS I UNDERSTAND IT SEVERAL HUNDRED WATER RIGHTS. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY LITIGATION IN EVERY DIRECTION SO. WHAT I'VE HEARD IS THAT YOU KNOW THE MOST AMBITIOUS OP I ESTIMATE AS TO WHEN NEW WATER COULD COME IN- THE RIVER FROM THAT REGULATORY PROCESS WOULD BE. A SEVEN YEARS BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD TEN TO TWENTY YEARS SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE ONE KEY ADVANTAGE OF THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT FRAMEWORK BE ACTUALLY GETTING THESE IMPROVEMENTS- IN BACK INTO OUR RIVERS QUICKLY. IF WE LOOK AT THAT TRAJECTORY WHAT WE THAT DOUBLES THAT SALMON DOUBLING GO BY TWENTY FIFTY. WE CAN'T FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE CAN'T WAIT FIFTEEN YEARS TO MAKE AND VOEPEL IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE WE I THINK WE ALL ASSUME WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE MAKE THOSE BARMA. THAT YEAH OKAY COME FLY. THE NOTE ON THIS IS THE A BREAKDOWN OF HOW THAT FIVE BILLION WOULD GET SPENT ALMOST ONE SEVEN ON HOW I SHOULD MENTION THAT WERE THAT BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO SHARE THIS PRESENTATION OF THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE. AND THEN LASTLY- DO I WANT TO MORE SLIDES- ONE IS IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHAT WE PUT OUT THERE IS A FRAMEWORK A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK- NEXT STEPS- IF WE GET THERE WOULD BE DEVELOPING THAT FRAMEWORK INTO A PROPOSED ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT. SO ACTUALLY THE FINE PRINT- THAT WOULD THEN GETS SUBMITTED FOR SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW OFFER COMMENT AND THEN UNDERTAKEN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS UNDERSEA C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> THEN HAVE THE WATER BOARD ACTUALLY CONSIDER IT AS A PROPOSAL OF IMPLEMENTATION AND THEY'D HAVE TO DEVELOP A SCIENTIFIC BASIS REPORT SO THE POINT IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT IT WOULD IT WOULD UNDERGO QUITE A LOT OF SCRUTINY. LASTLY YOU ASKED ABOUT THEIR MOLINO AFTER BAY. I'M IN A LOT OF THE- SALMON GROUPS HAVE MADE REALLY GOOD POINTS ABOUT LOOK LET'S LET'S LET'S PICK THE LOW HANGING FRUIT WHILE WE'RE NAVIGATING IS MORE COMPLICATED SUBJECTS AND THE FACT IS WATER THAT GETS THE THERMAL LIDO INSTANCE THERE- ONE OF THE FEATHER RIVER- I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT IT REALLY REDUCES SUITABLE HABITAT. FOR SALMON A LOT OF THE RIVER JUST 1% TO THRIVE AND- YOU OUT QUESTION BOTH OF YOU ABOUT. WHY CAN'T WE ACTUAL MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS- I THINK THE BILL THE EXPLANATION HAD BEEN THAT WERE WAITING ON A FOR LICENSE WHAT I CAN TELL YOU TODAY IS WE AGREE WITH YOU. ON THE NEED TO ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD ON THIS EFFORT AND- DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS DONE ABROAD FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT WHICH IS REALLY INITIAL WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BEGIN THIS YEAR A MUCH MORE DETAILED- FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WHICH IS A NECESSARY STEP ON THE CRITICAL PATH TO ACTUALLY GETTING THIS DONE. I THINK MANY OF US AGREE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS UNTIL THE FOR CREE LICENSING HAPPENS WHICH FRANKLY IT'S BEEN. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING ON FOURTEEN YEARS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THESE ABILITY- WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE A LOT OF PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING SAM AND- GROUPS. AND SO I THINK WHAT I CAN SAY THAT WHICH IS NEW HERE TODAY IS THAT- THAT I CAN GIVE YOU MY COMMITMENT TODAY THAT TO ACTUALLY START THAT WORK- WHICH IS THAT NEXT STEP IN THE CRITICAL PATH. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR TURN IT OVER TO CHUCK. BUT WE DO QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW MISS SECTOR YOU YOU MAY HAVE TO DART OUT HERE. WITH PRIOR ENGAGEMENT SINCE WE'RE LATE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR FLEXIBILITY DEIGN TO APOLOGIZE ONCE AGAIN. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THE VICE CHAIR HAS SOME QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND I KNOW I DO BUT PLEASE GO AHEAD MR MOISTURE. WITH JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WHEN IN LOOKING AT THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT YOU CAN EXPAND YOU HAD ONE CATEGORY OF WATER TYPE. NEW WATER PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS WHAT ARE YOU ENVISIONING. IN THAT CATEGORY SO THERE ARE THE NOT THE BLUE- SEGMENT SO THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED- FOR- DEVELOPMENT UNDER PROPOSITION ONE WHICH WAS THE TWENTY FOURTEEN WATER BOND BOND SO WHAT'S CALLED CHINO HILLS KERN FAN- LOS THE CHARACTER EXPANSION- AND SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY BE- REALIZING THOSE PROJECTS. ARE FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH- ADDITION TO OP SOME GROUND WITH GROUNDWATER BANKING PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. I'M WE ARE NOT IN THAT CATEGORY PROPOSING A NEW- AS I DON'T THINK ANY NEW PRODUCTS THAT HAVE. ALREADY BEEN- CONSIDERED THE PROP ONE THING PROCESS. THIS IS GOOD THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A RECORD. AS ASSEMBLY. STONE I WOULD ALSO ADD IN THIS. GRAPHIC TWO IMPORTANT POINTS FOLLOWING YEAH SO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IS. PUTTING A COMMITMENT ON THE TABLE HERE ABOUT DEMAND REDUCTION THAT'S SIGNIFICANT SECOND A LOT OF THE FINANCING UNDERNEATH THE CIRCLE IS A PROPOSED SELF TAX IT'S WATER AGENCIES IN DISTRICTS INCREASING THEIR OWN RATES FOR PURPOSES OF GENERATING THE REVENUE TO DO THIS WHOLE SALE COMPREHENSIVE ENDEAVOR THAT TOO IS ALSO PRECEDENT SETTING. AS I RECALL ABOUT 45% OF THAT BY BILLION AT LEAST IN THE FRAMEWORK THAT THE SECRETARY BLUMENFELD I SUGGESTED- WOULD BE BORNE BY THAT THAT SELF ASSESSMENT. GOOD FOR THE TEXT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WITH SECURITY I DESERVE A FEW ITEMS I WANNA FOCUS IN ON THE RELIEF I DIDN'T LIKE TO TRANSITION TO VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND THEN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL PINION SO LOOK AT I KNOW YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU TO BE OUR IS- I'M PARAPHRASING HERE OF THESE THESE ARE YOUR WORDS. BUT IF THEY'RE STANDS HAS BEEN. THEY WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL FOR CAT ISSUED A LICENSE. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON EVEN THAT MAJOR PLANNING COMPONENT YEAH SO- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT YOU W. R. THIS IS BEEN. ALI THAT THE FIRST WORD BIT OF A SHOW- FOR MANY YEARS IN THIS SPECIFIC AREA OF THE RIVER IN ITS KILLING TEN MINUTES WE KNOW IT I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU SO I THINK ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE A FOCUS IN ON IS THAT WHAT IS THAT TIMELINE RIGHT- FOR FEASIBILITY IN WHAT WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE. IS BEING ABLE TO HAVE A MEETING WITH YOU INDEED HAVE YOU ARE A SINNER NIELSEN SINCE IT'S AN IN HIS DISTRICT AND WALK THROUGH THAT JUST BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING RIGHT AND- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE TO GET THIS THING MOVING WITH THAT TIME LINE LOOKS LIKE AN OF HIM ANY COMMENTS ON IT YEAH I AFTER SPECIFIC QUESTION AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO HAVE THE CONTRACT BE PUT IN PLACE BY THE W. R. TO ACTUALLY- FACILITATE THE STUDY. BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE A MORE DETAILED FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AND DIRECTOR NAME IT HAS BEEN REALLY PROACTIVE MY QUESTIONS ON THIS. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT JUST BECAUSE AGAIN. LONG TIME COMING IN. IF WE TACKLE TALK ABOUT A LOW HANGING FRUIT PROJECT RIGHT I THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A DIRECT POSITIVE IMPACT TWO SPECIES IS IN PERIL I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THEM YEAH AND I'LL JUST MENTION THE YOU KNOW THE SOONER WE CAN GET THE FOR OUR LICENSE THE BETTER AND I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS BUT ALSO MAJOR RECREATIONAL BENEFITS. FOR THE OROVILLE COMMUNITY THAT'S REALLY BEEN THROUGH THE RINGER OBVIOUSLY IN RECENT YEARS SO ANY ANY- YOU KNOW- ANY COLLABORATION WE CAN HAVE ON ON MAKING THE CASE TO FOR TERROR ATTACKS BUT I THOUGHT WE HELPFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. WANT TO GO TO VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND- LOOK. AT I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU. IN THE MINISTRATION OF A WORKING ON- AND- IT IS NEVER EASY. RIGHT BUT THERE'S CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITHIN- ENVIRONMENTAL AND SEVEN COMMUNITY ABOUT THEIR VOLUNTARY. AND WHAT IS THE STICK TO BE OF THAT MOVE FORWARD WITH COMPLAINTS. AND IF WE DON'T SEE COMPLAINTS WHAT HAPPENS. CAN YOU GO THROUGH THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN IN REGARDS THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE YEAH SO LIKE I SAID I THINK THAT THE TITLE THAT'S NOW SORT OF TAKEN HOLD OF THESE SO CALLED VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS IS A BIT OF A MISNOMER. BECAUSE THE THESE WOULD BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND IT FOR THE WATER BOARD TO EVEN CONSIDER THIS A PATH OF IMPLEMENTATION THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ENFORCEABLE SO THIS WOULD NOT BE. YOU KNOW ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS THESE WOULD BE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE THERE'S AN OPEN QUESTIONS ABOUT. I AND THIS IS WHERE WE REALLY THAT THIS THESE QUESTIONS COME IN IN IN FINALIZING WHAT AT WHAT AN AGREEMENT WOULD LOOK LIKE- ARE THERE OFF RAMPS FOR EXAMPLE IF- THERE AT THE BY A LARGE BIOLOGICAL TARGETS THAT ARE DEVELOPED IN THE SPECIFIC AGREEMENT ARE NOT MET- I THINK THE WATER BOARD WOULD NOT HAVE MUCH IN. AT ALL IN VOLUNTARY THE PATHWAYS IMPLEMENTATION THERE WASN'T ACTUALLY- A TRUE- BINDING- SET OF COMMITMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION- SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'D LIKE IS ON ANOTHER SPACE AND TIME TO ACTUALLY WORK ON AN ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT THAT REALLY DETAILS. ON THE LEGAL ENFORCEABILITY TURN TO MAKE A CASE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE CONSERVATION GROUPS THAT THIS IS FAR FROM VOLUNTARY THIS IS ACTUALLY A- MANDATED. SO JUST JUST WALKING THROUGH THIS APP YEAH YOUR PATIENCE SO WORK WITH. AND OF CONTRACTS ALONG RIGHT WITHIN DELTA YEP OR WHO ME VALUES. ON THAT WATER FLOW THROUGH THE DOW. YOU NEED ACTON. VERISIGN THAT WE DEDICATE A NUMBER OF ACRE FEET. IT GOAL I I'M I'M I'M OVERSIMPLIFYING I. SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN- YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE FOLKS STEP UP. AGAIN WORST CASE SCENARIO RIGHT YEAH THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY STEP UP TO BE ABLE TO. SIGN UP THE UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT SOMEWHAT SIMILAR WE DID WITH THE- DRY CREEK BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM MCCAIN RUSSIAN RIVER. BUT CANDIDLY WE HAD CHALLENGES WITH LANDOWNERS STEPPING UP SO. WHAT HAPPENS THEN. YEAH I MEAN THERE WERE THERE THERE NEED TO BE CLEAR SANCTIONS THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE POTENTIALLY THE RIVERS AND- TO AN UNIMPAIRED FLOW SCENARIO. SO IT YOU KNOW JUST TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT WATER CONTRACTORS THEY GET THEIR WATER FROM YOU KNOW FROM THOSE RIVERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WATER CONTRACTORS THEY GET THEIR WATER FROM THE TRIBUTARIES OF THOSE RIVERS RIGHT FROM AS FAR NORTH AS AS THE SACRAMENTO MEANS DAM IN THE U. BAR. ALL THE WAY DOWN YOU KNOW NTO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IS NOT GOING TO WORK IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY THAT THERE AREN'T CLEAR SANCTIONS AND SO CHUCK I'M HAPPY IF YOU JUMP IN BUT- THE NOTION WOULD BE. THAT IF YOU BUY YOUR LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT THEN YOU ARE BROUGHT INTO THE REGULATORY REGIME SO YOU YOU STILL NEED INDIVIDUALS WE HAD A STEP UP THOUGH DO BETTER PARTICIPATE. SO I THINK THERE THREE FILTERS TO YOUR QUESTION FIRST IS. UNLESS SUFFICIENT PEOPLE COME TOGETHER AND EXECUTE. A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT. WE WON'T GET THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS SO THE SECRETARY HAS DESCRIBED THE FRAMEWORK WE HAVE SOME HEAVY WORK AHEAD OF US TO TURN THAT INTO AN ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT THAT'S THE SECOND POINT. ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT IN MY MIND SHOULD HAVE REMEDIES AND CONSEQUENCES IF PEOPLE DON'T DO WHAT THEY PROMISED TO DO. AND THEN THE THIRD FILTER WOULD BE. IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO COLLABORATE AND DO SOMETHING COMPREHENSIVE AND PRECEDENT SETTING. THEN THE REGULATORY PROCESS ARGUABLY SHOULD APPLY TO YOU WHICH IS THE UNIMPAIRED FLOW CALCULATION THE SECRETARY REFERENCED IN TIMELINE IS WHAT ON THAT. WELL THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS LITIGATION THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS COMPLICATE THINGS YEAH- AND SO YOU KNOW BUT OUR FOCUS- LET'S SAY SETTING THAT ASIDE FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES WAS TO REALLY MOVE TOWARDS- AND ENFORCEABLE AGREEMENT. TO BE PROPOSED TO GO THROUGH ALL THAT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW REALLY IN THE NEXT FOUR TO SIX MONTHS. OKAY ALL RIGHT. I AND I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY NOT BELABOR THE POINT HERE IN BECAUSE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL PENNY AS WELL. IS UNLESS. BEING CANDID RIGHT AND AGAIN I'M JUST USING MY EXPERIENCE MUCH SMALLER PROJECT COMPLICATED MUCH SMALLER PROJECT ON THE RUSSIAN SOME DIFFERENT DYNAMICS. UNLESS THERE'S DEADLINES GIVEN VERY GOOD INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO SIGN UP- AND IF YOU DON'T SIGN UP THEN THERE IS GOING TO BE A STICK THAT'S COMING DOWN. FOLKS DON'T TYPICALLY MOVE WITHOUT A DEADLINE AND THAT'S WHY DISTRICT FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND THEN HOW YOU BACK INTO THAT TOTAL GOAL OF WHAT YOU WERE JUST MENTIONING- IN REGARDS TO RESTORING SEE- SIX SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES HABITAT- EIGHT TO NINE OR TO THOUSAND. ACRE FEET INTO FLOWS BACK IN INTO THAT RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY HANDS ARE I MEAN I WILL SAY THAT. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WATER USER COMING TO THE TABLE IN A VERY SERIOUS WAY AS CHUCK MENTIONED YOU KNOW THERE. THERE ARE- YOU KNOW. TALKING ABOUT- CREATING THEIR FIRST SELF ASSESSMENT OF OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THESE IMPROVEMENTS. AND OBVIOUSLY NO ONE SIDE ON THE DOTTED LINE OF THAT BUT THERE ARE A LOT THAT ARE. HAVING BRACE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THAT. SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THEY DO THEY ARE AT THE TABLE IN PART BECAUSE OF OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A REGULATORY PROCESS IF THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. LAST THEY'LL SAY I DON'T WANT TO HIDE THE BALL THOUGH THERE'S YOU KNOW REASONABLE PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH US AS IT RELATES TO HOW MY WHAT THE FLOW NEEDED. VERSUS THOSE OTHER- IMPROVEMENTS WHICH GETS ITS REALLY GOOD SEGUE BECAUSE IT LOOKED THIS BIOLOGICAL PAIN IS MOVING FORWARD IT COMPLETELY SCREWS OVER TEMPERATURE PROTECTIONS EIGHT SCREWS OVER- ELIMINATES FLOW PROTECTIONS RIGHT- AND IS GONNA KILL SALMON. SO HOW IN AGAIN THIS IS NOT YOU RIGHT THIS OUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I MEAN THIS MESSES IT ALL UP. YEAH IT LIKE I SAID LIKE I SHOWED YOU THAT MEAN IT'S SEPARATE BUT OVERLAPPING AND SO YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON THIS- ON THIS FIFTEEN YEAR AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS- GRAPH AND WE'RE THINKING HOW THE HECK ARE WE GONNA CHANGE THINGS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WE'RE GONNA BEAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THAT LINE GOING LOWER AND FRANKLY CAN'T GO MUCH LOWER FOR SOME OF THOSE SPECIES. SO THAT'S WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON BUT- BUT- BUT SENATOR YOU'RE- YOU'RE RIGHT THIS DOES THIS DOES MUCK UP THE WORKS. YEAH IN- SO CAN YOU JUST WALK US THROUGH AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ON THIS BUT- WALK US THROUGH THE NEXT STEPS SO OBVIOUSLY SHOT ACROSS THE BOW- CALIFORNIA THROUGH ATTORNEY GENERAL WORKING CORNISH WITH YOUR OFFICE IN THE GOVERNOR. HAS MOVED FORWARD ON LITIGATION AND WHAT YOU WOULD HOPE TO BE ABLE TO SEE WITH THE GRAND VISION- OF THE PLAN THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE TO SEE IMPLEMENTED. YEAH SO I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT. THAT THESE CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT THE FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL OPINION NEED TO BE RESOLVED AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN CLEAR THAT IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO SIMPLY LITIGATE TO LITIGATE- THAT IF WE CAN ACTUALLY RESOLVE OR SETTLE OUR CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD WELCOME THAT YEAH- AND THAT WOULD AT LEAST CLEAR- SOME SPACE FOR A COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS- THAT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW THE I'D SAY THAT'S THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION AT THIS TIME WHETHER THOSE CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED. IN THE LAST PIECE HERE IN AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT THE SECRETARY DOING THE TO QUESTION PIECE IN THIS WILL DO BE A COMMA LOOK. AND I TO THE DIRECTOR LOOK FOR THE DIRECTOR'S REPORT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SCIENCE BASED DECISIONS AND WHAT YOU LIKE ME TO IMPLEMENT. I'M THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SIGNS IT HAPPENS AGREEMENTS. AND IT STINKS AS- THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES- ON THE FEDERAL- INSIDE. THAT REPRESENTED MEANING THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH- I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO. ON THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET MANDATED. ACTION A- A NEW OUTLOOK AND NEW SCOPE. BUT THIS COMPLETELY SCREWS UP ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. SENATOR HERE HERE'S WHAT I'D SAY. I THINK YOU KNOW THE SUB I PUT MYSELF THROUGH LAW SCHOOL AND TO DO FISHERIES RIVER ECOSYSTEM WORK. IN MY CAREER IN CALIFORNIA SO FAR I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH A COMPLICATED MOMENT. OF SUCH IMPORTANT PIECES WHICH POTENTIALLY. ONE COULD HARMONIZE FOR A GRAND OUTCOME THAT DOES RECOVERING CHANGE THAT DOUBLING TRAJECTORY. BUT RACES SUCH UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE OF THE STAKES IN THE DYNAMICS INVOLVED. THAT SAID. THIS IS NOT NEW NEWS SECRETARY CRAWFORD A MINUTE AGO TOLD YOU AND THE AUDIENCE THAT. HOW MANY MONTHS OF THE ADMINISTRATION NOW. FOR A NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION FIFTEEN. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A SEPARATE STATE PERMIT- BECAUSE FIFTEEN MONTHS AGO WE PROJECTED THIS VERY LIKELY CONFLICT WHERE THE STATE WOULD BE UNWILLING TO RELY UPON THE FEDERAL WORK PRODUCT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. ALL RIGHT. SO I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IN THIS IS NOT THE THESE AREN'T THE DIRECTOR'S WORDS IN THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SCIENCE. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DATA- IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH- A GIVE ME- TO FORMER CLIENT. AWKWARD SILENCE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT- MISTER SECTOR IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A COVER- IN AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY INTO THE PUSH YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU HAD SEVERAL QUESTIONS- BUT YOU WANT TO TALK TO COVER SO I'D SAY. IF YOU WANT TO TRANSITION TO HIM SUPPORT THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI DALE. TO GIVE YOU LIKE THE ROAD RUNNER- DUST STRAIGHT OUT. WE GO ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR AT THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR GIVE TEN MINUTES THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SO IT'S TRUE MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM I'D BE GLAD TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE KIND OF SHIFTING GEARS AND FOLLOWING YOUR REQUEST FOR MY TEN MINUTES I WOULD TAKE US ON A QUICK TOUR THROUGH CRAB. SALMON OPEN ACCESS KELP. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT AQUACULTURE SOME COATED WIRE TAGS. IN TEN MINUTES AND TEN MINUTES TO COME IN WITH THIS IDEA OF HOPE WHICH IS. PERHAPS CLICHE BUT IMPORTANT TROPE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. YOU SAID THOUGH TELL YOU A PRIORITY MY PRIORITY IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AND I WANT TO TAKE THE MOMENT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVERYONE IN THE ROOM I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THIS REALIZES. MONEY MATTERS IN THE BUDGET IS AN EXPRESSION OF YOUR PRIORITIES SO I WANT TALK A LITTLE BIT. ABOUT OUR BUDGET OUR DEPARTMENT IS CHARGED WITH. PRESERVING NATURE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL THAT WILDLIFE AND PLANT DIVERSITY. WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR WE TRACE OUR ROOTS TO THE BOARD OF FISH COMMISSIONERS. WHICH WAS STRTED TO STOP THE MARKET HARVEST OF WILDLIFE COMMENSURATE WITH THE GOLD RUSH. SO GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS PROPOSING SOMETHING I HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IN MY TENURE AS DIRECTOR A DIRECT INVESTMENT INTO OUR DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE SECRETARY CRAWFORD'S LEADERSHIP ABOUT BIODIVERSITY. AND I WOULD ACTUALLY ARGUE IT'S A SALMON BUDGET PROPOSAL HERE'S WHY. AS YOU KNOW- THE PROPOSAL IS TO AUGMENT OUR DEPARTMENT WITH THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND FIFTY ONE NEW POSITIONS. SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT PROPOSED INVESTMENT IS TO MODERNIZE OUR HATCHERIES THE PEOPLE SITTING BEHIND ME CARE ABOUT THAT A LOT HERE'S WHAT WE DO THAT SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WE BY EIGHTEEN EXHORTING MACHINES. INSTEAD OF SQUEEZING THE FISH IN THE HATCHERY WE CAN AUTOMATE THIS IT DOESN'T CHANGE OUR LABOR LEVEL BUT IT INCREASES OUR EFFICIENCIES. AND WOOD BY FORTY THREE TRUCKS SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE SURVIVAL RATE OF THE SMALL FISH WERE WE TAKE FROM THE HATCHERY TO THE RIVER OR THE OCEAN. THAT'S A SMART ONE TIME INVESTMENT. WE TAKE SIX MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AND WE'D BY OURSELVES A NEW FIXED WING AIRCRAFT WE HAVE SEVEN PLANS SIX WERE BOUGHT IN THE EIGHTIES YOU HAVE TO QUESTION YOUR HEALTH AND SAFETY BEFORE YOU GET ON TO SOME OF THEM. WE NEED A PLANE FOR ONE REASON AS A GREAT EXAPLE. OUR FUTURE OF MANAGING MAJESTIC MARINE MAMMALS IN THE OCEAN. DURING THE CRAB SEASON IS PROBABLY FLYING OVER THE WHALES AND COMMUNICATING THE HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN BEHIND ME. TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND AVOID ENTANGLEMENTS AN ASSET LIKE A PLANE. IS RETURN ON INVESTMENT. IT'S PART OF THE FISHERIES AND SAM AN ASPECT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WELL DONE STOP THERE. YOU HEARD THE SECRETARY'S PRIORITY ABOUT CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE. FOR OUR DEPARTMENT WE TAKE A PORTION OF THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT WE'D ADD FIFTEEN NEW PEOPLE AND WE SPENT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS BASICALLY FROM SAN FRANCISCO NORTH FOR ALL THE COASTAL STREAMS BECAUSE WE'RE CONVINCED YOU CAN BRING COASTAL SALMON BACK IN CALIFORNIA HERE'S HOW YOU DO IT. YOU PUT A LAWYER WITH THE GRANT MAKER WITH THE RESTORATION PLAN WITH THE PERMIT- WITHOUT A WATERSHED COORDINATOR. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT WITH THIS GROUP OF FIFTEEN MULTI DISCIPLINARY UNIT ONE STOP SHOP CLEARING HOUSE FOR ALL THE RESTORATION TRIBAL COMMERCIAL FISHING ENVIRONMENTAL ENERGY PROGRESSIVE LEADERSHIP AT THE CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY PROGRESSIVE TIMBER COMPANIES. AND INVEST IN GETTING TO SCALE AND PACE ON THE RESTORATION OF THAT SAME A LANDSCAPE CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE. BUT IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. YOU MAY KNOW THAT. WE MANAGE THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE SPECIES ACT PROGRAM WE HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE MANAGING THAT WHOLE PROGRAM FOR THE WHOLE STATE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD GIVE US THIRTY ONE NEW PETITION POSITIONS FOR THIS IS A PROGRAM. AND ADD TEN POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT WORK JUST IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE PETITIONS TO ADD. YOUR THE CALIFORNIA SUMMER STILL HAD TO THE PROTECTED LIST AND THE UPPER KLAMATH TRINITY- RIVER CHINOOK SALMON TO THE LIST THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE WORK LOAD THE BUDGET WOULD BE RESPONDING TO. BUT DON'T STOP THERE. AT THE END OF THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION WE GOT A BUDGET AUGMENTATION WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIRTY MILLION MORE DOLLARS AND THIRTY POSITIONS THAT SUNSETS NEXT YEAR. GOVERNOR NEWSOME IN A PRUDENT WAY IS PROPOSING TO JUST MAKE THAT CONTINUE IN PERPETUITY. HERE'S WHAT WE DID WAS SOME OF THAT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE PUT ALMOST THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND ELEVEN PEOPLE ONTO OUR MARINE WORK. WE BOUGHT OUR FIRST EVER PATROL BOAT FOR NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO WE STOOD UP OUR FIRST AND I WOULD SAY NATION ONLY WHALE SAFE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE'VE CLUED AND ISSUED EXPERIMENTAL PERMITS FOR LIKE THE BOX CRAB FISHERY WHICH ARE RESPONDING TO CHANGING FISHERY NEEDS IN A WARMING OCEAN WE'VE- DONE FIVE ELECTRONIC UPDATES ACROSS OUR MARINE VESSELS WE USE FOR MONITORING. WE TOOK A DATA SAID THAT IS EXISTENCE SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND HAS BEEN PAPER. AND WE MODERNIZED AND DIGITIZED THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT'S WHY I STARTED WITH BUDGET LET ME TURN TO THAT OTHER QUICK TOUR CRAP. CRABBE HAS PROVOKED THIS DYNAMIC WITH MARINE MAMMALS. AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE SPOKE ABOUT A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT HAVE BEEN REACHED BETWEEN THREE PARTIES WE ARE ONE OF THOSE PARTIES SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING COMMITMENTS AND COMPLETING OBLIGATIONS WE ARE MID COURSE IN FINALIZING A STATE RULE WHICH WILL MEMORIALIZE A RISK US. AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. CALL THE RAMP. WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY LED BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SENATOR HERE'S WHERE WE ARE IN THAT RULE MAKING. WE'VE PUT OUT TWO DRAFTS. TO SEE INFORMAL FEEDBACK. BEFORE A MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED IN PERSON IN SAUSALITO NEXT WEEK WHICH IS NOW BEEN CONVERTED TO A TELECONFERENCE. WE WILL PUT OUT A THIRD INFORMAL DRAFT OF THE PROPOSED RULE. THE RULE DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE FOR DECISION MAKING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE WORKING GROUP WHICH IS MULTI DISCIPLINARY STAKEHOLDERS. AND TELLS YOU THE CRITERIA USED TO MANAGE THIS INTERFACE BETWEEN MARINE MAMMALS AND THE CRAB FISHERY. THAT'S ALL CONSULTATION BEFORE WE MOVE TO AN ACTUAL FORMAL SUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TO COMPLETE THE RULE MAKING WHICH WILL PROMPT YET ANOTHER ROUND OF PUBLIC FEEDBACK RESPONSE TO COMMENTS WE ARE HECK BENT ON COMPLETING THIS RULE MAKING BY NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. TO SETTLEMENT WE MADE AND IT'S ALSO THE PLATFORM IN WHICH WE WILL GO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND I WOULD ARGUE GET THE FIRST EVER. FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT PERMITS FOR A FISHERY THAT'S FIXED GEAR LIKE DUNGENESS CRAB RELATIVE TO THE WRIST TO MARINE MAMMALS IN OCEAN SPACE THAT IS TO ALONE IS PRECEDENT SETTING. WE WON'T GET THERE. WITHOUT REALLY SOLID OPEN TRANSPARENT COORDINATION COMMUNICATION WITH THE TRAFFIC CRAB FISHERY SO WHAT I BELIEVE THE CRAB FISHERY WILL SEE BEFORE THEY GET TO THE MEETING NEXT WEEK IS A REVISED RULE KIND OF A STRAW PERSON THIRD VERSION. THAT REFLECTS A LOT OF THE INPUT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A IN HIS ROLE FOR THE WORKING GROUP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A GREATER EMPHASIS ON BASS SCIENCE AND ADDITIONAL ASPECTS SO THAT'S COMING. ON A RISK ASSESSMENT FRONT YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT IS SETTLEMENT ARRANGEMENT WE NOW HAVE CALENDAR MOMENTS. WHERE WE CONVENE THIS ADVISORY GROUP WHICH IS COMPLETELY COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE FLEET THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY ACADEMICS. AND WE ASSESS THE SITUATION AT CERTAIN MOMENTS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S A HIGH MEDIUM OR LOW RISK. BETWEEN THE FISHERY AND ENTANGLEMENT AND THEN MAKE A MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATION. OR POTENTIALLY A DIRECTOR ACTION THAT GROUP MATT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. THAT GROUPS ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO ME THAT THE STATISTICS KIND OF THE INFORMATION THAT'S HAPPENING IN REAL TIME IS THIS WORKING GROUP CONCLUDES THE RISK OF ENTANGLEMENT IS LOW THAT MARINE LIFE CONCENTRATIONS RIGHT NOW IS LOW THAT ARE OCEAN ENFORCED CONDITIONS THE RISK OF THAT PRODUCING THE PROBLEM IS LOW AND THAT THE FISHING DYNAMICS RISK. IS LOW. SO THE WORKING GROUP ALSO DID NOT RECOMMEND ANY MANAGEMENT ACTION. AND THEY RECOMMEND WE KEEP THE SEASON GOING PAST APRIL ONE. I'M REQUIRED UNDER THE SETTLEMENT TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS BY MARCH FIFTEENTH WHICH HAPPENS TO BE A SUNDAY. TO AVOID DOING THAT ON A SUNDAY WE'RE GONNA. MAKE OUR PRONOUNCEMENT TOMORROW THE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT RECOMMENDATION AND WHETHER WE HAVE A MANAGEMENT ACTION WE WANT TO DO IT TOMORROW JUST CRIED GIVE CERTAINTY AND PLANNING STABILITY. THAT'S THAT pTHE FORECAST IS YOU KNOW WE RUN COMPLICATED MODELS THERE'S A FEDERAL COUNCIL THAT ENGAGES MANY IN THE ROOM ON DETERMINING THE UP COMING YEAR PREDICTIONS. SO THOSE PREDICTIONS ARE MIXED FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY OCEAN SALMON FISHERY BECAUSE- ON THE SACRAMENTO FALL RUN CHINOOK SIDE THINGS LOOK TO BE IN DECENT SHAPE RIGHT NOW. AND DUE TO STRONG TURNS LAST SUMMER. THE PROTECTIONS WE WOULD OTHERWISE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE LEGALLY PROTECTED SACRAMENTO WINTER RUN CHINOOK. WE DON'T EXPECT TO HAVE TO PUT SUCH STRANGER WAS PROTECTIONS INTO PLACE THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE FISHING OPPORTUNITY IN THE OCEAN. SO IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD IN THE SACRAMENTO. PARTICULAR COMPARED TO A COUPLE YEARS AGO. BUT IF YOU TURN TO THE KLAMATH FRONT IT LOOKS NOT GOOD AT ALL SO THE CLAIM OF FALL RUN CHINOOK STOCK FORECAST IS NOT OPTIMISTIC. FULL STOP. AND THAT'S FALLING FROM A VERY POOR RETURN. THAT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE LOWEST RETURNS WE'VE EVER HAD ON RECORD FOR THAT RIVER. AND IT IS BECAUSE THAT THAT WATERSHED IS IN A DROUGHT SCENARIO. AND IT TOO HAS A LOT OF VERY SIMILAR WATER TENSIONS ABOUT WATER MANAGEMENT GOING ON BOTH IN A LEGAL ARENA. AND YOU KNOW ASSOCIATED WITH STOP FROM OREGON DOWN TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. SO WE EXPECT OCEAN FISHING OPPORTUNITIES NORTH OF POINT ARENA TO BE PRETTY LIMITED IN TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMIC THAT'S PLAYING OUT ON THE CLAIM. SO THAT'S A UPDATE ON- PROJECTIONS YOU ASKED ABOUT DISASTER. SO WE DID GET THE DIRECT PAYMENT OF CRAB DISASTER FUNDS OUT LAST YEAR. RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR THE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DISASTER RELIEF. WE'RE EVALUATING THEM WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE PACIFIC MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PROJECTS SHOULD BE AWARDED TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO DO TESTING CAPACITY THIS IS AROUND THE DEMO A GAS AT ISSUE. WE DO NOT HAVE DATES FOR PRO GOVERNMENT YET FOR THE DISBURSEMENT OF EITHER THE SALMON OR THE SARDINE FUNDS TO US. BUT KNOWING WE NEED A QUICK TURNAROUND I WOULD SAY WE THINK WE'VE ALREADY FIGURED OUT THE SARDINE DISASTER SPEND PLAN SO ONCE IT GETS TO US WE HAVE A WAY TO TURN AROUND THE FUNDING PRETTY QUICKLY. AND ON THE SALMON DISASTER FRONT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXPENDITURE PLAN WE'VE GOT FEEDBACK FROM INDUSTRY- ALL OF THAT IS UNDER REVIEW BY US RIGHT NOW. WE ARE ON A TIGHT TIME LINE TO GET THE EXPENDITURE PLAN SET. AND I THINK IF YOU WERE ASKED NO OR DAVID GOLDBERGER ROB ROSS THEY WOULD AGREE THAT. GIVEN PRIORITIES WE SHIFTED A TOUCH TO BE THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE SALMON MANAGEMENT DECISIONS WE HAD TO MAKE IT RIGHT NOW. WITH THE DISASTER EXPENSE PLAN- OUT TO THE BACK BURNER. BUT NOW WE HAVE TO BRING IT. BRING IT BACK UP TO THE FRONT DOOR. SO THAT'S DISASTER. OKAY OPEN ACCESS GOOD STORY. IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME. CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED A DRAMATIC DECLINE OF ITS GROUND FISH TOOK IN LINE ROCK FISH FISHERIES OFF OUR COAST. AND THE FEDERAL COUNCIL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT SEVERELY RESTRICTED BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO FISH FOR THOSE FISH. IT WORKED. WE'RE NOW AT A PLACE WHERE JUST LAST WEEK AT THE FEDERAL COUNCIL OUR DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH MANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE ROOM WENT PUBLIC AND SAID WE THINK THIS GROUND FISH POPULATION HAS REBUILT AND REVITALIZE SUCH THAT WE OUGHT TO PUT AS A HIGH PRIORITY OPENING BACK UP THE FISHING OPPORTUNITY EXCEPT FOR TROLL EVERY OTHER THE- BALL. TO REBUILD A COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. IT'S DUE TO THE HARD WORK OF THE MEN AND WOMEN BEHIND US WHO TOOK THE PAIN OF THE RESTRICTION HOPING ONE DAY WE WOULD GET BACK TO REBUILD POPULATION WE THINK WE HAVE AND THAT'S A GREAT STORY. LAST NIGHT ACTUALLY YESTERDAY A MEMBER OF THE CFA REMARKED TO ME THAT THERE COMMUNITY IN HALF MOON BAY CHANGED OVERNIGHT. ONE MOMENT THEY WERE ABLE TO CATCH GROUND FISH THE NEXT WE CUT HIM OFF. AND THEY LOST IT. THE IDEA OF GIVING THAT OPPORTUNITY BACK IS SOMETHING I DIDN'T THINK I'D SEE IN MY TENURE. COULD WHAT TAX IT'S KIND OF WAY IN THE WEEDS BUT IT WAS WHEN YOUR QUESTIONS AS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IS WE PUT TINY LITTLE MICROCHIPS IN SALMON. HATCHERY I'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT. FOR A DAY. THIS STUFF. KIND OF IN- YOU KNOW TAKE YOUR JOB TAKE YOUR BOSS OUT FOR A DAY KIND OF THING. THAT'S WHAT THEY ASKED ME TO DO. AND IT'S INCREASE THE DATA SAID TO UNDERSTAND HOW FISHER MOVING. AND IT FUELS THE INFORMATION INTO THOSE MODELING. EFFORTS I WAS DESCRIBING. WE'VE BEEN LAGGING BEHIND IN THE ABILITY TO TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION IN AND GET OUT THE REPORT WE KNOW THAT. SO WE GOT OUT THE- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN REPORT IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT OUT BY AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT OUT BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MEMORIALIZE AN INTERNAL PROCESS AND PROTOCOL. THAT WILL COMMIT OURSELVES TO. ISSUE ONCE A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER YOUR DAD A RECEIPT. AND GET THIS WAY MORE STRUCTURED RELIABLE AND PREDICTABLE. LET ME JUST SHIFT THE HOPE. AND IN THERE BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE QUESTIONS I MEAN YOU HEAR IT ALL THE TIME. BUT WHAT ANGLER RECREATIONAL OR COMMERCIAL DOESN'T GO OUT TO THE WATER BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE OF HOPE LEFT RIGHT EVERY TIME YOU CAST THAT LINE OR DROP DECK YEAR YOU HOPE YOU HAVE A BOUNTIFUL RESPONSE. RIGHT SO WHAT AMAZES ME EACH YEAR IS BOTH YOUR DEDICATION CHAIR AND CO CHAIR AND TOM BUT THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS AS TO SALMON I'M PRETTY MUCH A SALMON GEEK. I WOULD ARGUE THERE'S NO GREATER JOURNEY IN NATURE. THEN THOSE FISH THEY ARE BORN IN A RIVER. THEY SWIM OUT TO THE OCEAN YEARS LATER SOMETHING CLICKS. IN THEIR DNA AND THEY COME BACK TO THE VERY SAME PLACE. DESPONDENT START THE CIRCLE OVER AGAIN I CAN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER CREATURE THAT HAS THAT KIND OF LIFE JOURNEY. SO I'M JUST PLEASE EACH YEAR IN AND OUT YOU NEVER EVER EVER GIVE UP. ONE TRYING TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF SALMON IN CALIFORNIA AND WHILE THE DECLINE FEELS OVERWHELMING. IT IS FOR ME PERSONALLY AWAY I KEEP GETTING UP. IS TO MAKE SURE I CELEBRATE THE SMALL BUT OFTEN REALLY IMPORTANT SUCCESSES ALONG THE WAY. THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER RESTORATION PROGRAM WHICH SOME MEMBERS IN THE NEXT PANEL OF BEEN INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN. WE'RE SEEING FISH COME BACK TO THAT RIVER SPRING WRENCH ENOUGH. FIRST TIME IN DECADES. WE MADE A SUBMISSION TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION LAST WEEK. THAT WERE ON TRACK ON BUDGET AND ON PACE TO TAKE OUT THE DANCE IN THE KLAMATH RIVER WHICH WILL BE THE NATION'S LARGEST RIVER RESTORATION PROJECT. EVERY CALL OVER. THE GETS FIXED EVERY WATER EFFICIENCY PROJECT WITH THE WATER DISTRICT ALL THAT COUNTS WE CAN DO THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRICTER GREAT JOB TODAY BREAK GRATEFUL WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF THE VICE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO EVENT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU THE DIRECTOR FOR YOUR FOCUS ON THE RAMP I'LL COME DRAFT DRAFT RAGS RIGHT- BECAUSE THEY HAD THEIR EARLY. AND LOOK THEIR CANDIDLY WERE. SOME CONCERNS SOME DEEP CONCERNS- FROM THE FLEET AND OTHER DIRECTOR HAIR HAS MADE HIMSELF AVAILABLE- WITH THE WORKING GROUP PROCESSORS PC FFA AND SEE SEE SEE A AND- I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT- JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT A PREVIEW IF YOU WILL NO MORE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE IF YOU KEEP IT THAT IN TWO MINUTES BECAUSE WE GOT TO GET OUR SECOND PANEL AND I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS ON WHAT TO EXPECT HERE IN SAUSALITO. THE TELECONFERENCE I GUESS NOW YEAH SO. HERE ARE SOME LIKELY CHANGES I THINK THE COMMUNITY- SEE WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT DRAW PERSON DRAFT. WE TOOK UP A BIG FOCUS ON WHETHER THE SECTION OF THE RULE THAT HAS A LOT OF DEFINITIONS. WAS CREATING AMBIGUITY AND WHETHER WE CAN TIGHTEN UP A LOT OF THAT. SO I THINK YOU COULD SEE THAT. WE WANT TO PUT A GREATER EMPHASIS ON WHAT BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE MEANS RELATIVE TO THIS KIND OF STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRITICISMS OR FEEDBACK POINTS WAS WE DON'T SEE THE PROMINENT ROLE THE WORKING GROUP. YOU'VE RELIED ON US DON'T CUT IS OUT SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE A BETTER DESCRIPTION OF THE ROLE OF THAT WORKING GROUP IN THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING. WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE FINER SCALE MANAGEMENT TOOLS INSTEAD OF. BEING STUCK SHOULD YOU PURSUE A CLOSURE ACROSS THE WHOLE COAST. WERE ACROSS THREE COUNTIES. IS THE FUTURE OF THIS GOING TO BE MORE SURGICAL AND PRECISION BASED WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT CLOSURE HERE BUT GREATER OPENING THEIR CONNECTED WITH YOU EAL TIME MANAGEMENT I THINK THAT WILL COME OUT IN THE RULE MORE. I THINK YOU'LL SEE. UNACKNOWLEDGED MEANT THAT PART OF THE CONTEXT OF THIS STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING. IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC. ASPECT OF CLOSURES AND RESTRICTIONS. DUNGENESS CRAB IS PROBABLY MUCH LESS RELIABLE BUT IT STILL REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST LUCRATIVE FOR HARD MARK WORKING MEN AND WOMEN TO MAKE A GO OF IT IN OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT IS SOMETHING THEY NEED CERTAINTY AROUND. SALMON IS NOW BECOMING HIT OR MISS AND CAN'T REALLY HELP IN THE SHOULDER SENSE SO THINKING ABOUT THE PRESERVATION OF THAT CRAB INDUSTRY. WHILE KNOWING EVEN ONE IN TEN A MONTH IS ONE TOO MANY IS REALLY OUR TASK. NOW THAT'S I APPRECIATE THAT PREVIEW AND YOU HIT ALL THOSE POINTS HAVE BEEN ADVANCED- BY C. C. C. A.'S WELLS PCF A IN THE PROCESS WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT. I THINK ON THE ISSUE BUDGET- AND WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON THE TO RE OPEN THAT ONE. WHAT THE DIRECTORS PROPOSING- DIDN'T ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN BAND WITH A HATCHERIES DESPERATELY NEEDED. THE PLANE- WE SOUGHT. EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THE CHALLENGES WE HAD VERY GOOD THAT SEASON OPENED IN WE NEED THAT DIRECT COMMUNICATION AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING IT IN I THINK THE BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING THROUGH I KNOW IN THE BUDGET PROCESS IS JUST THE EIGHTEEN POINT NINE AND WHERE IT COMES FROM RIGHT AND SO- BECAUSE AGAIN YOU ARE. SPOT ON. ON THE INVESTMENT. AND AGAIN. THIS ADMINISTRATION IS MINISTRATION BASING HIS DECISIONS ON SCIENCE AND DATA. IN WHAT IS GOING TO HELP THE SPECIES. JUST WISH. ALL MINISTRATIONS WOULD DO THAT IF I COULD BE CANDID SO. I GRATEFUL FOR ON THAT. YOU WILL TALK ABOUT THE DENTURES CRAP TASK FORCE IN FUNDING. ACTUALLY I MEANT TO MAKE NEWS ON THE YOU'RE GOOD IF YOU FOR REMINDING ME NO NO YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOOD ME. JUST MAKE SURE THAT THE RIGHT. THE DATA TO THE NEWS YEAH DEPARTMENT COME I'M GOING TO COMMIT THE DEPARTMENT TO FUNDING THE DUNGEON THIS CRAP TASK FORCE WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO THIS SO WE'RE GONNA COMMIT THE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- TO KEEP THAT TASK FORCE GOING IT'S IN STATUTE IS IN TROUBLE- WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE ARE JUDGES CROP ACCOUNT FUND MANAGER. COMPLETE ALL THE DETAILED ACCOUNTING THAT YOU AND OTHERS IN THE TASK FORCE ARE ASKING FOR AND WE HAVE A TARGET DATE TO GET THAT DONE BRING IT BACK AND HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND. SHE TO THINK YOU FOR IT KNOWN AS WELL BREAK GRATEFUL. THE LAST ITEM IF YOU DON'T MIND I TAKE A LOOK AT IS. AS WE ADVANCE. ARE ON THE ISSUE OF THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION. YOUR BELIEF AND WHAT IT WOULD DO. TO FISH SPECIES IF IT WAS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED. THE OPINIONS THE FEDERAL ID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BIOLOGICAL OPINION WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN WHAT'S THE IMPACT IF THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED. WORSE THAN THE OUTCOME WE BELIEVE WILL OCCUR UNDER A SCIENCE BASED STATE PERMIT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT SO I'LL TAKE SALMON AS AN EXAMPLE. AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T YOU KNOW I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S COMPLAINT FILED IN FEDERAL COURT. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WHAT'S CALLED A SIXTY DAY NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUE UNDER THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT BECAUSE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES IN DESCRIBING CONCERNS SO THAT'S THAT'S THE MOST APPROPRIATE REFERENCE POINT. BUT JUST THINKING ABOUT SALMON ONE OF THE THINGS ON OUR DEPARTMENTS MIND. IS. AND YOU'LL LOS THRESHOLDS WHICH WE UNDERSTAND AND I BELIEVE HAVE A RATIONALE. BUT IN IN IN YOUR MANAGEMENT SINCE YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A CALENDAR YEAR ARGUABLY ACCUMULATING IMPACT AS YOU GO. IN YOUR THRESHOLD IS LOOKING ACROSS A LONGER TIME FOR IT. AS COMPARED TO. A CONSTRUCT- ACROSS THAT TIME HER RISING YOU'RE DOING INTERIM MOMENTS WHERE YOU'RE CHECKING IN. TO OBSERVE ANALYZE AND DESCRIBE IMPACTS SO YOU'RE BREAKING THE TIME HORIZON INTO DIFFERENT THRESHOLD MOMENTS. MY ANALOGY IS YOU I'VE GOT AN OLD PICKUP TRUCK I ALSO HAVE A HYBRID. AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S A MANUAL SO YOU CAN GO UP TO FIFTY YEAR AND YOU CAN BE FINE AND FIFTY OR FOR A LONG TIME BUT YOU KNOW YOU MAY NEED TO DOWNSHIFT. CONVERSELY WHAT THE FOURTH FIRST YEAR CHECK YOUR RPM'S YOU CAN TRANSITION SECOND AND THE THIRD AND FOURTEEN GET THE FIFTH. I THINK FOR ARTICLE. OUR ORIENTATION IS AROUND THE SHIFTING UP THE GEARS IF YOU WILL WHY YOU'RE KEEPING TRACK OF LOS THRESHOLDS RATHER THAN GOING UP TO YOUR HIGHEST GEAR. WITH THIS THEORY THE CHILL DOWN SHOULD IF THAT MAKES SENSE THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A DIFFERENT ORIENTATION. FROM THE STATE THINKING AND WHAT YOU MAY SEE IN THE FEDERAL OPINION. ACTUALLY THINK IN A MORE PERFECT WORLD. AND I BELIEVE IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE A MORE PERFECT UNION IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU CAN SORT OUT THOSE DIFFERENCES WITH GOOD CONVERSATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS AND DIFFERENT AGENCIES. APPRECIATE SORT OF THIS RECORD. GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE AGAIN APOLOGIZE THAT WE STARTED LATE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE- AS WELL. I IN NICE JOB TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH STRICTER THANK YOU CHIEF BEST AS WELL. WE SEE. THANK YOU NOW COULD BE MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR- THE SECOND PANEL OF THE DAY THE SECOND PANEL IS TITLED SAVING CALIFORNIANS ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES ARE BRIEFING ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DANGEROUS YOU WATER POLICY THAT WERE FIRST CAN HEAR FROM KATE POOL. EIGHT IS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR- WATER AND THE WATER RESOURCE FOR THEM WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCE. COUNCIL GIVE ME. TERMINATE COMING HERE FOR CHINOOK SALMON I IN LIGHT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S BIOLOGICAL OPINION- ADVANCEMENT WERE SECONDLY WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM JOHN MCMANUS HE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GOLDEN STATE SAMUS DITION HE'S GONNA BE PRESENTING. THE CHALLENGES THE CHALLENGES THAT RECREATIONAL SALMON FISHERMEN WILL FACE WITH THIS DUE TO THE IN RIVER IMPACTS WHICH ARE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR- AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE ADEQUATE FLOWS- IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESTORATION FIVE. WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE SHORT TIMER IN WERE STILL UPSET WITH THEM- AS HE'S MOVING TO ME I KNOW I COULD NOT EASY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION ENTERTAINMENT SO SHE CAN A WHAT WAS ALSO HONORED AT LAST NIGHT AT THE DINNER IF YOU WEREN'T THERE. BUT WE THANKED HIM FOR HIS SERVICE ON BEHALF OF FISHERMEN IN PROTECTION OF FISHING THE STATE AND GIVEN THE ROUND OF APPLAUSE. NO IS ALSO OKAY SEEN ON ALL IS. OF FLOW IN HABITAT NEEDS. LIGHT OF THE RECENT DISASTERS FEDERAL CHANGES SO UP FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER IN HIS POOL THIS BILL WILL HAVE FIVE MINUTES. WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ADVOCACY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST PULL THAT MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER TO SO WE CAN PICK UP EACH OF THE VOICES IN IF EACH OF OUR- SPEAKERS IT WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT MIKE CLOSE TO THE MATH. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERM ACQUIRING. OR STONE GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M MY NAME IS KAY PAUL I'M A SENIOR DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ATTORNEY AT THE NATURAL RESORCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. FOR TWO QUIT. WITH I CALL. A FULL FOR THAT GREAT FOR YOUR TODAY. I'M GONNA TELL BRIEFLY ABOUT THE TWO BY OPINION FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT- THEY'RE LIKELY IMPACT ON SALMON AND OTHER NATIVE FISH AND THE STATE'S RESPONSE BUT I'D LIKE TO START BY REMINDING US HOW WE GOT HERE- YOU REMEMBER WAY BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN WHEN CALIFORNIA BEGAN EMERGING FROM WHAT. MANY DESCRIBED AS THE WORST DROUGHT THE STATE IS EVER EXPERIENCED SINCE RECORD KEEPING BEGAN. THAT MULTI YEAR DROUGHT WRECKED HAVOC ON FISH WILDLIFE AROUND THE STATE- WAS PARTICULARLY BAD IN THE DELTA NUMEROUS SALMON RUNS DELTA SMELT. OTHER THREATENED AND ENDANGERED FISH. PLANS TO SOME OF THE LOWEST LEVELS EVER SEEN AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE DROUGHT IN POOR. DECISIONS MADE DURING THE DROUGHT. AND IN RESPONSE TO THOSE ALARMING DECLINES THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN CULVER FOR REVISITING THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT WERE THEN IN PLACE THE OPINIONS. FOR THE EXPLICIT PURPOSE OF STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTIONS OF THOSE OPINIONS. THEN INTERIOR SECRETARY JEWEL. CAPTURE THAT INTENTION IN A MEMO TO THE PRESIDENT WHERE SHE SAID THAT THIS PROCESS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO NEW OR AMENDED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THAT WILL INCREASE PROTECTIONS FOR THE SPECIES AND THAT THOSE EFFORTS COULD LEAD TO FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN WATER SUPPLY. FAST FORWARD TO LAST YEAR. WHEN I PROCESS FELL INTO THE HANDS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THAT HAS BEEN TURNED ON ITS HEAD AND INSTEAD OF THIS EXERCISE BEING FOCUSED ON INCREASING PROTECTIONS FROM PEARLED FINISH. IT'S BEEN TURNED INTO A PROJECT- EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE WATER DELIVERIES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS WHICH WERE FINALIZED LAST OCTOBER DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE BIOLOGIST SAID WAS NECESSARY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND NAY ELIMINATE OR WEAKENED PROTECTIONS FOR SALMON AND OTHER SPECIES ALMOST ACROSS THE BOARD. AND FOR SPECIES THAT ARE BARELY SURVIVING YEAR TO YEAR THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE QUITE LITERALLY LITERALLY A RECIPE FOR EXTINCTION. BUT DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT I'D LIKE TO READ A FEW QUOTES FOR YOU FROM A LETTER- TWO LETTERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE. THE CAL NEVA CHAPTER OF THE AFS. REPRESENTS OVER FOUR HUNDRED FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENTISTS. ESTAMOS FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGENCIES ACADEMICS OTHERS WHO ENGAGED IN FISHERIES WORK TRUCK CALIFORNIA. THIS GROUP OF EMINENT SCIENTISTS RECENTLY SAID THAT THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS QUOTE SEVERELY TRUNCATE OR ELIMINATE EXISTING PROTECTIONS ON QUOTE QUESTION WHY. QUOTE DESPITE THESE ADDED IMPACTS TO THE SPECIES AND THE DOWNWARD TREND IN POPULATION ABUNDANCE ON QUOTE THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS DON'T INCLUDED JEOPARDY DETERMINATION AND INCREASE PROTECTIONS. THEY ALSO NOTE THAT THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS QUOTE INCREASE THE UNCERTAINTY OF RECOVERY OF LISTED SPECIES BY FURTHER EXACERBATING CONDITIONS IN THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BASINS AND DELTA. THIS STATE IS REITERATED MANY OF THESE CONCERNS AND THEIR- COMMENTS AND IN THE COMPLAINT THAT- DIRECTOR BONHAM REFERRED TO. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND- DO YOU SEE IN MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE IN SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER ALLIES HAVE SUED TO INVALIDATE THESE HARMFUL AND SCIENTIFICALLY BASED BUS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS I HAVE ASKED THE COURT TO PREVENT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION- OUR CHALLENGE IS BEING HEARD. I'M AS FOR THE STATE WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR EIJI BUT SERRA AND THE STATE COMING IN RECENTLY AND ALSO FILING SUIT AGAINST HIS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. AND THEY'VE RACED MANY OF THE SAME CONCERN SO WE HAVE. ARE THE OTHER GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE STATE RESPONSE TO THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ISSUED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IS THAT THE STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE ITS OWN. REQUIREMENTS ON THE OPERATIONS OF BOTH THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. TO PREVENT THESE TRUMP ROLLBACKS MOST DIRECTLY UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR'S SENATE BILL ONE SPONSORED BY PRO TEM ATKINS THAT ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO FULLY USE THIS AUTHORITY TO PROTECT THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES FROM TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ATTACKS INCLUDING THESE ANTICIPATED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. WHEN THE GOVERNOR VETOED SB ONE HIS ADMINISTRATION ASSURE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC THAT THE STATE HAD ALL THE AUTHORITY IS NEEDED TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THESE BAD BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND THAT THEY WOULD DO SO. UNFORTUNATELY TO DATE WE'RE NOT SEEING THE STATE'S ACTIONS LIVE UP TO THAT PROMISE. INSTEAD THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS PROPOSED A WATER PROJECT OPERATIONS THE CLOSELY NEAR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL IS ABOUT ONE MINUTE. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS NOT EXERCISED IT SEES THE PERMITTING AUTHORITY OVER THE FEDERAL CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT ALTHOUGH IT HAS A FORTY TO DO SO. NEITHER OF THESE AGENCIES HAVE YEP FIND MISTER APPROACH SO THERE'S A CHANCE FOR THE CORRECT THEIR WAYS AND INSIST ON MORE PROTECTIVE ACTIONS CALLED FOR IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. BUT IF THE STATE AGENCIES CONTINUE DOWN THE PATH OR ON NOT ONLY WILL SALMON ANOTHER SPECIES CONTINUED THEIR DOWNWARD SLIDE PERHAPS IRREVOCABLY. BUT ANY DIFFERENCES IN PROTECTIONS IMPOSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WILL ONLY BE APPLIED TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. WHICH WILL HAVE TO REDUCE THEIR WATER DIVERSIONS TO MAKE UP FOR WHAT MORE WATER BEING DELIVERED TO THE FEDERAL PROJECT. I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPORT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE OUR TWO OTHER PANELISTS AND THEN WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS THAT WORK FOR YOU PARKS ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. IS IN GENERAL INTRANET FLORIDA JOHN MCMANUS HE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GOLDEN STATE SEVEN ASSOCIATIONS MINISTER GREAT FREE THAT YOU'RE HERE. FOR YOUR WORK IN YOUR FIVE MINUTE SIR. GREETINGS SENATOR ASSEMBLY. I'M JOHN A TENNIS ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOLDEN STATE SENATE ASSOCIATION OF BEEN. HERE BEFORE I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE REPRESENT. OF SPORT AND- COMMERCIAL SALMON FISHERMEN AND WOMEN AND RELATED BUSINESSES. FIRST I JUST WANT TO START BY THANKING THE LEGISLATURE FOR ITS WORK ON SB ONE LAST YEAR THAT- KATE JUST MENTIONED. WE'RE SORRY THAT THE- GOVERNOR VETOED IT. IT WAS INDEED AN INSURANCE BILL. TO PROTECT US FROM ENVIRONMENTAL TAX. FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION- YOU SAW VERSION OF THIS THAT WEIGHED SHOWED. THIS IS BASICALLY TO SHOW IN THE POPULATION TREND FOR. CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON. THIS GOES BACK TO NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE YOU GET THE IDEA WE'RE GOING DOWN I WANT TO. JUST REAL BRIEFLY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED OUT IN THE OCEAN LAST YEAR THIS PAST SALMON FISHING SEASON WHAT I WANT TO POINT TWO IS THE CONTRIBUTION OF NATURAL ORIGIN FISHER. KNOWS NATURAL ORIGIN FISH ARE CODE FOR. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A RIVER SYSTEM SO YOU CAN SEE THE NATURAL ORIGINS ALMOST WILL THEIR WAY OVER 40% BOTH THE RECREATIONAL IN THE COMMERCIAL OCEAN FISHERY- WE POINT BACK TO- TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE WET SPRING A TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH REALLY HELP THESE FISH GET OUT TO THE OCEAN WE HAVE HEALTHY RIVERS WE GET A GOOD CONTRIBUTION FROM THE NATIONAL ORIGIN AND WE NEEDED. TO HAVE A DECENT FISHERY THE HATCHERY FISH ALONE ARE NONE AND NOT ENOUGH TO GET US THERE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS I JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT THAT. AND THAT IS YEAH I THINK YOU'VE HEARD OTHERS REFERENCE THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY CAN WORK UNLESS THE FEDERAL TRUMP BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE REVERSED. AND THE REASON WHY AS YOU HEARD. WAIT CROWFOOT TELL YOU THAT HE THOUGHT THERE WAS ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY INTO THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. BUT WHAT THEY MIGHT GIVE OUT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE TRUMP BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. SO THE BIOPSY BASICALLY. WILL BE BACK UP JUST FOR A SECOND. YOU'LL NOTICE A CONGRESSMAN KEVIN MCCARTHY STANDING THERE AT THIS VERY EVENT HE TOLD THOSE PEOPLE AND EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE THERE BAKERSFIELD. THAT THESE BY OPS ARE GOING TO DELIVER UP TO A MILLION ACRE FEET OF ADDITIONAL WATER. WELL THERE GOES A SEVEN TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FEET THAT WEIGHT CROWFOOT JUST TOLD US ABOUT. SO WE CAN GET THE BENEFITS UNLESS THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE STOPPED AND IT'S KATE MENTIONED WERE IN COURT ALL OF THE GROUPS THAT AT THIS. ARE PLAINTIFFS IN THAT SUIT. AND THANKFUL TO THE STATE FOR COMING IN AND JOIN US. IF THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS GO FORWARD THIS IS WHAT WE CAN EXPECT WE'RE GONNA SEE YESTERDAY'S MOVIE ALL OVER AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE BLUE LINE SHOWS WATER EXPORTS FROM THE DELTA IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THEY MIMIC. WHAT THE TRUMP BY OFFICER CALLING FOR NOW THE RED LINE SHOWS YOU WHAT HAPPENED WAS SALMON RETURNS AND THEY JUST FELL FELL OFF A CLIFF. SO WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE THAT MOVIE AGAIN WE WERE SHUT DOWN IN 200-082-0009 WE COULD NOT FISH. BECAUSE OF THAT BLUE LINE INCREASE WATER EXPORTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. ANOTHER ASPECT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THE TRUMP BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE UPPER SACRAMENTO RIVER THAT'S A PICTURE SHASTA DAM RIGHT THERE THE UPPER SACK COULD OVERHEAT THIS YEAR THERE'S ALREADY CONCERNS ABOUT THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH THEM GIVEN TOO MUCH WATER WAY TOO EARLY IN THE YEAR NOT KEEPING THE COLD WATER WE'RE NOT THERE YET WE HOPE WE CAN AVOID IT BUT THERE ARE SOME WORRISOME SIGNALS. AND IF THAT HAPPENS THIS IS WHAT WE END UP WITH AND THIS JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR SALMON. MY QUESTION IS AND I WONDER IF THIS BODY CAN HELP- PRO THIS QUESTION. WHAT ROLE WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD IN THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE PLATE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T OVER HERE. IN THE UPPER SACK THIS YEAR THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY WILL AND WE SEEK THE HELP OF THIS COMMITTEE AND GETTING THEM. TO DO SO I'M CHANGING TOPICS HERE. SENATOR MCGUIRE YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE YOUR SIGNATURE THERE I WAS STUDYING THAT SIGNATURE. AT WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES SEEKING HELP TO GET OUR THERMAL LEGAL PROBLEM SOLVED THIS IS THE HOT WATER PROBLEM ON THE FEATHER RIVER WHERE WHERE THAT D. W. R. RESPONDED WITH A FLAT NO TO THE REQUEST THAT THEY DO SOMETHING IT WAS VERY HEARTENING TO HEAR SECRETARY- CROWFOOT TODAY SAY THAT MAYBE SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THERE WHEN IT COMES TO VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT- A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WAS STAR STRUCK REGARDING THE RE LICENSING OF THE OROVILLE DAM THIS IS YOUR BILL DAM ON THE FEATHER. IN THAT OF VA WAS STRUCK BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND YET IT'S NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO FOR THOSE OF US ON THE PERIPHERY WATCHING ALL THIS TALK ABOUT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AND WE'RE WONDERING WHAT BECOMES OF THESE PROMISES WHEN THEY'RE NOT CAP SOME FOURTEEN YEARS LATER. THIS VIDEO THE SHOULD START TO CIRCULATE ON YOU TUBE AND ELSEWHERE RIGHT NOW IT'S PUT OUT BY THE NOR CAL GUIDES AND SPORTSMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND- ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DOCUMENT IS SOME THIRTY THOUSAND FALL RUN SALMON WERE YANKED OUT OF THE FEATHER RIVER NOT ALLOWED TO SPAHN NOT CAUGHT BY FISHERMEN NOT ALLOWED TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR NUTRIENT LOAD TO THE ENVIRONMENT YANKED OUT LAST YEAR AND SENT TO A FOR PROFIT COMPANY UP IN. WASHINGTON IS COMPLICATED REASONS HERE SOME OF THOSE FISH THAT'S JAMES STONE WAS SHOT UP IN WASHINGTON STATE WHERE THEY PUT THESE HATCHERY FISH BACK UP FOR SALE AT THE YANKED OUT OF THE RIVER AND HERE'S THE THERMAL LIDO OUTLET COMING OUT OF THE THERMAL YOU KNOW AFTER BAY THAT'S HOT WATER COMING. INTO THE FEATHER RIVER. ALL I WANT TO SAY IS WE GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED. WE CAN GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE OF THIRTY THOUSAND FISH BEING YANKED OUT THEY PICK UP FIFTEEN MILES OF SPAWNING HABITAT DOWNSTREAM IT'S NOW TOO HOT. AND WE CAN LEAVE THOSE FISH IN THE RIVER AND THEY COULD SUPPLY THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND EVERYBODY ELSE- YOU'VE SEEN THIS PICTURE BEFORE SOCIAL A CORE A BILL OR A BILL DAM. OF THE FAMILY TO VERSION IT'S SET FOR ITS ULTRA. ABOUT ONE MINUTE SIR AND I'M GETTING CLOSE- SWITCHING AGAIN JUST A SHOT OUT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. FOR HELPING US ON SHASTA. THIS IS FLOOD CONTROL RELEASES THAT YOU SEE COMING OUT OF SHASTA DAM WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO KEEPING THE HEALTH OF THE UPPER RIVER. IN GOOD SHAPE FOR SALMON SPAWNING THEY REACH THAT WE DON'T SEE THESE FLOOD CONTROL RELEASES ANYMORE THEIR THING OF THE PAST. GRATUITOUS SHOT TO SHOW WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG KIDS THAT WE TOOK FISHING LAST YEAR. AND HOW STOKED THEY ARE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A SALMON HOME TO THEIR PARENTS. THEIR HEROES IN THEIR OWN FAMILIES ON THEIR BLOCK IN CITRIX SPECTRA ONE OF THE REASONS WE LIKE TO KEEP SALMON IN THE PICTURE. AND THAT IS THE END OF MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS TO MAKE MASS WE'RE GONNA COME BACK TO YOU FOR SOME QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- HERE IN JUST A MOMENT BUT FIRST LET'S HEAR FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S. ASSOCIATION NO OPPENHEIM YOUR FIVE ANSWER AND WE'LL GIVE YOU ONE IN A PROMPT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. JERRY MCGUIRE AND AN INVESTOR STONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ATTENDING- AND TO BOTH OF YOU FOR. BOTH YOUR YOUR KIND WORDS LAST NIGHT AT THE- FISHERMANS FORMER SECTION. MY NAME'S NO OPPENHEIM ON THE- SHORT TIMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. WHICH IS A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING FOURTEEN PORT. ASSOCIATIONS HARVESTING COMMERCIAL FISHERIES FROM SAN OF ART ACROSS THE CITY. AND FOR FORTY FOUR YEARS THE FEDERATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO FIGHT ON BEHALF OF WORKING FISHERMEN AND WOMEN. THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES THEY DEPEND ON AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY. THAT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY HAVE BEEN IN SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING. YEARS IN THE RECENT POLITICAL HISTORY. OF CALIFORNIA FISHERIES. IN PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC KING SALMON FISHERY THE THREE FOOT FISH THAT WE'RE ALL FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF. THERE'S A GLIMMER OF GOOD NEWS IN THIS ARENA BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RAINS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE COMMERCIAL HARVEST WAS BOUND TO THE LAST SUMMER BEST WE SEEN AROUND FIFTEEN YEARS AND THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY- IT'S BASED ON THE- HIGH ABUNDANCE OF SACRAMENTO FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON. NOW TWENTY NINETEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AVERAGE YEAR A COUPLE DECADES AGO BUT IT'S WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH NOW AND YOU SIGNED THAT EARLIER PRESENTATIONS. THAT'S BECAUSE OUR BASS LINES HAVE SHIFTED- THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE GOOD NEWS ENDS. ON THE ONE HAND KLAMATH RIVER SALMON POPULATIONS ARE IN DIRE STRAITS THESE DECLINES WILL LIMIT OCEAN FISHERIES THIS SUMMER THESE DECLINES ARE DRIVEN BY THE DEVASTATING KLAMATH BASIN BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FOR WATER OPERATIONS IN THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF POOR DEBBY DAMS THAT LOCALLY ARE SLATED FOR REMOVAL. ON THE ONE HAND AN ARRAY OF MONEY POLITICAL INTERESTS ARE- SUCCESSFULLY HIJACKING THE WATER POLICY APPARATUS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR IN ORDER TO DIVERT AND DELIVER WATER AWAY FROM SAM AND FUNCTIONING RIVERS AND TOWARDS UNSUSTAINABLE MUNICIPAL AN AGRICULTURAL WATER USE. WERE AWARE OF THE CAMPAIGN PROMISES MADE BY THE PRESIDENT TO HIS BASE IN THE VALLEY. PROMISES THAT CAN ONLY BE REALIZED AT THE EXPENSE OF SALMON FISHERMEN AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES DOWNSTREAM. IN ORDER TO DELIVER ON THESE PROMISES FORMER OIL IN CORPORATE AG LOBBYIST DAVID BURKHART WHO IS NOW AT THE HOME OF INTERIOR ORDERED THE SUBVERSION OF NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE BIOLOGICAL. BUT THE CENTER VALLEY. LAST WELL NATURAL FISHERIES SERVICE SCIENTISTS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PROJECT. THE PROPOSED BY. YOUR RESULT J. TO YOU WITH THE COURT EASY DOCUMENT DEPRESSED MANY OF THE SITE FIFTEEN MEMBER AT THE AGENCY REDUCED. WITH DIRECT WATER USING USE INPUT SANK BY THE DO. NGUYEN ACT THE CONCLUSIONS WERE. IN THE RELATIVE BLINK OF A BUREAUCRATIC AYE JEOPARDY BECAME NO JEOPARDY AND HERE WE ARE TODAY. MEANWHILE THE IMPACTS OF THE NEW CVP OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE WILL ALSO RESULT IN ADVERSE MODIFICATION OF ESSENTIAL FISH HABITAT DESIGNATED BY THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT. WHICH SUPPORT IT'S THE- OF CA. HOW SAM RUNS AS WELL AS THE ESA LISTED STOCKS WELL THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS TO CENTRAL SALMON FISH HABITAT. THEY WERE MET WITH LIP SERVICE AT RECLAMATION AND A RECORD OF DECISION WAS SIGNED WITH NO PROJECT MODIFICATIONS TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS. RECOGNIZING THE EXTRAORDINARY CALLOUSNESS OF THESE FEDERAL ACTIONS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S ADMINISTRATION HAS JOINED OUR ORGANIZATIONS IN FILING SUIT AGAINST HIS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS AND THE FEDERAL PLANS FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT AND WE APPLAUD THESE ACTIONS WE APPLAUD ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SERRA TO STAFF. FOR THEIR EXCELLENT AND HARD WORK WE'VE ASKED THE COURT TO ENJOY THIS PROJECT. AND WE IMPLORE THAT THE STATE DO SO AS WELL THE TIME IS STILL THERE FOR THE REQUEST FOR AN INJUNCTION. REPORTS ARE ALREADY COMING IN AS MY COLLEAGUE JOHN MCMANUS STATED THAT SHASTA OPERATIONS ARE ALREADY RAMPED UP BEYOND LEVELS THAT WOULD MAKE US COMFORTABLE AND CERTAINLY WE COULD BE ON TRACK FOR EXCESSIVE DEPLETION OF COLD WATER POOL IN CHASKA. PARTICULARLY OF DRY WEATHER CONDITIONS YOU RECEIVE DENTAL DEVASTATING IMPACTS TO SAM UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR EYES THE STATE CAN ASK THE FEDERAL COURTS TO STOP THIS AND IT SHOULD. UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL ORGANS OF THE STATE ARE FIGHTING TO. THE FIGHT TO PROTECT SALMON AND THE ENVIRONMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES HAS CIRCULATED STRAP THE I. R. THAT IN MANY WAYS AS WAS STATED EARLIER PARALLELS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IT'S RACE THE BOTTOM. WE DO HAVE DAILY IN THE STATE WATER OF ALL COMMENTED ON THE- DIRECTION THE STATE. DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS PROPOSING TO TAKE AND WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF WELL. IN PARTICULAR THE STATE WATER PROJECT SHOULD NOT PROPOSED OPERATE OLD MEN NO RIVER FLOW RATES- MORE NEGATIVE THE NEGATIVE FIVE THOUSAND CFS. THE STATE SHOULD MAINTAIN THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER INFLOW EXPORT RATIO IN APRIL AND MAY. THE STATE PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE DELTA OUTFLOW OVER AND ABOVE WHAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY FROM THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND NINE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. IN THE PROJECT MUST INCLUDE DAILY AND ANNUAL LIMITS ON THE NUMBER OF FISH THAT CAN BE KILLED AT THE PUMPS THAT ARE TRULY PROTECTIVE. OF ESA LISTED FISH THAT CONSTRAIN OUR MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC TRUST FISHERIES RESOURCES LIKE FALL RUNNING LATE FOR RUN CHINOOK SALMON. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WORKING IN STATE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE IS NOT. WORSE BUT IS BETTER FOR THE SENATE FISHERY. DOUBLING GOALS ARE NOBLE BUT THEY FAILED IN THE PAST. AND IT'S IPORTANT NOTE THAT TODAY WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE CERTAINTY ABOUT THE BASS LINES FOR THE DOUBLING GOALS. TWO TIMES NOTHING IS STILL NOTHING THESE NEED TO BE MEANINGFUL DOUBLE ANGLES- IN THIRTY YEARS. IS A LONG TIME TO ACHIEVE THEM PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE FLUCTUATING WATER CONDITIONS. AND THE HYDROLOGY THAT COULD IF THESE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED- RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CURTAILMENT. MAYBE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS OF THE PATH FOR IT I CAN'T SEE HOW THAT HAPPENS WITH OF THE STATE WATER BOARD BEING PREPARED. TO ORDER UP UNIMPAIRED FLOW REQUIREMENTS BY DATE CERTAIN THESE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL. FOUR TO SIX MONTHS IS A IS AN AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE TO PUT TOGETHER CONTRACT THAT WILL BE CLOSE TO TWO YEARS AFTER THE STATE WATER BOARD ACTED LAST DECEMBER OR DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ANDWITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE RAPID PACE THAT THE NEWSROOM MINISTRATIONS PROPOSED FOR THIS PROCESS. WE NEED ACTION NOW AND WE NEED DATE CERTAIN FOR FALL BACKS WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE STATE WATER BOARD PROCESS. IF VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS DON'T WORK AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR- STRICT ENFORCEABLE TIMELINE FOR THAT ACTION. OUR FISHING INDUSTRY SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD A REPEAT OF THE MISTAKES OF THE PAST WE NEED ACTION- AND I THANK YOU. ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WE MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS DROP AND I AM- WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK OUR PANEL STRUCTURE ANY ITEMS THAT YOU HAVE. I THINK. I LOOK. WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME CENTRAL VALLEY FARMERS AT THAT THIS WOULD NOT. THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE ALARMIST THEIR WORDS NOT MINE. THAT THERE'S NO WAY THIS WOULD CAUSE AN EXTINCTION OF IT. I IN TWO MINUTES IF YOU ALL DON'T MIND- WALK US THROUGH. HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN IF THIS BIOLOGICAL PLAN OPINION OR IMPLEMENTED. FIRST. UP LET ME START OFF- THEY SHASTA COLD WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT THAT BOTH MY COLLEAGUES REFERRED TO. WHAT WE'RE ON A PATH TO THIS YEAR RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE DRY CONDITIONS WE'VE EXPERIENCED IS- HAS BEEN MODELED TO LOOK SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WE EXPERIENCED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN MORE THAN 95% OF THE SALMON. SPAWNING AND REARING BELOW SHASTA DAM WERE KILLED BY WATER TEMPERATURES THAT WERE TOO HOT AND FRY. UNDER THIS BIOLOGICAL OPINION EVEN THOUGH RECLAMATIONS MODELING SHOWS THAT IS UNLIKELY EVENT AND IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE BECAUSE THAT WAS BEFORE WE HAD TO DRIVE FEBRUARY. THAT'S ALLOWED THEY CAN GO AHEAD AND OPERATE THAT WAY AND WIPE OUT A 100% OF THE SALMON SPAWNING IN REARING BELOW SHASTA. THEY CAN DO THAT FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW. THIS IS A THREE YEAR LIVED SPECIES- YOU WEBER MOB THREE YEARS IN A ROW AND WINTER RUN CHINOOK OR GOD WHO ONLY SURVIVE BELOW SHASTA DAM AND FOREIGN SPRING RUN ARE ALSO FOUND THERE AND- WILL NOT BE. IMPROVED BY THAT SCENARIO. NO I APPRECIATE DIRECTS MISSION THANK YOU SO LET'S THIS DO ANOTHER LAYER ON THAT THERE'S. DEVASTATING NOMINAL IMPACT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF JOBS HOW MANY JOBS ARE RELYING ON A HEALTHY SALMON FISHERY AND IT'S A TOP TIER FISHERY IN THE STATE AS WELL SO IF YOU ALL DON'T MIND. LET'S JUMP INTO WHAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO LOOK LIKE FOR I THINK TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOLKS ARE DEPENDENT A HEALTHY SEVEN FISHERIES TO WALK US THROUGH THAT SHEILA TRIED AS WELL OBVIOUSLY SO KENYA CAN TALK TO US ABOUT THAT ALSO A COUPLE THINGS IN ACOSTA NOAH. AT TEN THOUSAND FEET WE'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND JOBS RELATED TO THE SAME INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN A NORMAL YEAR WHEN WE GET A DECENT SEASON- A LOT OF THOSE JOBS. SIR IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR SUMMER AROUND THE SPORTS SIDE AND THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT MULTIPLIERS TO LIKE THE HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS THE LAUNCH RAMPS THE MARINAS. THE TACKLE SHOPS AT CENTRO THAT ALL GET IN ON IT I'M- NOAH CAN EXPOUND ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE I JUST WANT TO SAY. A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT OBVIOUS ARE VISIBLE BUTOVER ON THE SPORTS SIDE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING SPENT. I THINK OF THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE RECORD SHOWS SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER PERSON PER DAY THAT THEY GO SALMON FISHING. BOATS IN THE OCEAN AND INLAND SIDE NURSED TENS OF THOUSANDS ACTUALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CHASE SALMON. FOR SPORT CELL THERE'S A HUGE ECONOMY JUST AROUND THE SPORT FISHERY NO. JOHN IT IS. CENTER OF OUR IN A GOOD YEAR IN THIS DECADE YOU CAN EXPECT TO SEE AROUND PERHAPS. NINE HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED FIFTY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN INDIVIDUAL BOATS OPERATING IN THE SALMON FISHERY AND THAT'S THAT'S IN THE BEST YEAR THAT WE'VE SEEN IN QUITE SOME TIME. ON THE OTHER END IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES WE COULD EXPECT TO SEE FOUR THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND VOTES SO IT UNDER BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES WE'VE LOST 75% OF THE FLEETS CAPACITY- IN REALITY WE HAVE PERHAPS A HUNDRED BOATS THAT ARE COMPRISING THE MAJORITY OF THAT FISHING EFFORT IN A GIVEN SEVEN SEASON- AND CERTAINLY THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT EFFORT IS NOT- IS. TRACKING THE HISTORICAL TRENDS WE ARE LOSING FISHERMEN LEFT AND RIGHT TO EITHER JUST EXASPERATION OR- TO SEEKING OTHER FISHING OPPORTUNITIES THIS IS A PORTFOLIO FISHERY SALMON IS THE TRADITIONAL SUMMERTIME FISHERY AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IT'S THERE IS THE THIRD LEG OF THE TRADITIONAL SMALL SCALE FISHING STOOL SALMON. CRAB ROCKFISH WITHOUT ONE OF THOSE LEGS THE WHOLE INDUSTRY FALLS APART IF I CAN JUST PUT A FINE POINT BOTH OF YOU HAVE COASTAL DISTRICTS. BOTH OF YOU HAVE COASTAL COMMUNITIES. I'M A NATIVE CALIFORNIAN I THINK YOU BOTH ARE TUNED AND YOU'VE WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENED WE HAVE A DIVERSE ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA IN A LOT OF THE COASTAL COMMITTEE. OUT COMMUNITIES WILL PERSIST BUT NOT ALL OF THEM. YOU'VE GOT SOME IN YOUR DISTRICT AND I BELIEVE YOU TO ASSEMBLYMAN SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING JOBS IT'S ALSO- COASTAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS BELIEVE IT OR NOT SOME OF THE INLAND COMMUNITIES THAT RELY ON SALMON FISHING EVERY FALL. ON THIS WITNESS THINGS HAVE REALLY GOOD POINT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT RULE COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN THE LIFE FLIGHT IS FISHING INDUSTRY- AND WE ARE COMPLETELY HOST- ESPECIALLY OF A DOUBLE WHAMMY OF A CHALLENGING CRAB SEASON. AND IN NON EXISTENT SALMON SEASON ADVANCE IS DEVASTATING FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMY. I'D LIKE TO TURN TO MISS POOL- QUICKLY. THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT SALMON BUT THIS IS ALSO ABOUT. LARGER MAMMALS IN WALES. RIGHT SO TALK TO US ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT WE SEE. ON THAT FOOD STOCK- OUT IN THE OCEAN IS WHAT IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. FOR THAT FOOD STOCK FOR THESE BEAUTIFUL MAMMALS THAT ARE FEEDING ON SAME AS WELL. WELL THAT'S RIGHT THE- THE TWO THOUSAND NINE BIOLOGICAL OPINION THAT THIS NEW ONE IS REPLACING. WASN'T JEOPARDY OPINION FOR ORCAS AS WELL BECAUSE- SALMON ARE ORCAS MAIN FOOD SUPPLY AND SO WHEN THE SALMON STOCKS ARE PHÃN NOT ONLY ARE THESE GUYS AND ALL OF THEIR- CONSTITUENTS. BADLY IMPACTED BUT- ALL OF THE- LARGE MAMMALS BOTH IN THE OCEAN AND UPSTREAM THAT RELY ON THEM FOR FOOD FOR REPLENISHING THE SOIL FOR. FERTILIZING REDWOOD FORESTS ALL OF THOSE- BENEFITS ARE GONE. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALSO TALKING HERE ABOUT- THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION FOR DELTA SMELT WHICH YOU KNOW IS FREQUENTLY CHARACTERIZED AS- THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE FOR THE DELTA SO IN THAT SENSE THE DECLINE OF THE SPECIES FROM YOU KNOW NOT TOO MANY DECADES AGO IS THE MOST ABUNDANT IN THE DELTA ONLY LIVES HERE. TOO NOW FUNCTIONALLY EXTINCT BY MANY- MANY BIOLOGISTS ASSESSMENT THAT MEANS WE'RE DOING SOME REALLY BAD IN THE DELTA THIS THIS SPECIES IS TELLING US HOW THAT ECOSYSTEM IS FARING IN ITS NOT DOING WELL I THINK THAT IT IS IF YOU'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE FISHING COMMUNITY HAVE NO IDEA. THAT THE STOCK IN THE SACRAMENTO. IMPACTS WESTERN STATES IN ALL THE WAY UP TO CANADA SO- IF YOU DON'T MIND. AT QUICKLY TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST IMPACT IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS. OUR THAT THAT'S CORRECT. I THINK NO I CAN TALK MORE ABOUT HIS- MEMBERS OF PC FFA UP IN OREGON BUT ARE CALIFORNIA THE SACRAMENTO BORN CHINOOK SALMON STOCKS SUPPORT THE FISHERY UP AND DOWN THE WEST COAST IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA- SO FOR AGAIN SOME IN WASHINGTON AND BEYOND- OBVIOUSLY WE ARE EXPERIENCING THREATS TO SALMON POPULATIONS ALL THE WAY UP TO ALASKA FROM DIFFERENT. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS AND OTHER THINGS SO. THIS IS REALLY A- IT'S NOT JUST IN A THREAT TO UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA ARE UNIQUE TO OUR CHINOOK SALMON RUNS IT'S A IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO SALMON IN THE WAY OF LIFE THEY SUPPORT. WITH THE FREE TRIAL SO- ABOUT 60% OF THE KING SALMON CAUGHT IN THE OCEAN OFF OF THE OREGON COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO KEEP FALCON WHICH IS ALMOST UP TO THE BORDER WITH WASHINGTON COME OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HUGE VOLUME OF FISH FROM CALIFORNIA THAT ARE RELIED ON BY OREGONIANS ON THE PRIOR QUESTION ABOUT THE NUTRITION VALUE- WE'RE ONE OF THE RARE PLACES IN THE WHOLE EARTH WHERE THIS INCREDIBLE WELL IN THE GOES ON OFFER COAST EVERY SPRING NGUYEN TURNS ON THE NORTH WEST. WATER COMES UP FULL OF NEW TRICKS THERE'S EXCLUSIONS OF KRILL AND BECAUSE OF THE SAM AND WE'RE BLESSED TO HAVE THIS VEHICLE IT SUCKS UP ALL THAT CREEL IN BODIES IN THE SPANISH BRINGS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND FERTILE. WHOLE CENTER FELL. SO OUT WERE SITTING ON CERTAIN REALLY SPECIAL HERE IT DOESN'T EXIST EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THAT IS PROBABLY WOULD COST MORE OFTEN THAN NOT YEAH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FOUR FOUR MAIN HOME AT THIS REVENUE- LESS COMPLETE THEY'RE JUST VERY BRIEFLY WHEN THE SET AND- THAT ARE PRODUCED IN OUR RIVER AT THE OCEAN THEY JUST REALLY TURN RIGHT. AND AS THE STATE THEY ARE. ARE TO THE- SEVENTY OF COMMERCIAL AND- FISHERY. UP AND DOWN THE WEST COAST TRUE OUR IN PRODUCING RIVERS ARE- A BREAD BASKET FOR BOTH PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE OCEAN AND- I LIKE TO SOMETIMES REMARK THAT- IF WE DON'T PROTECT. OUR SALMON THEN WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE MAIN COURSE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE SALAD LET'S NOT DO THAT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS STRATEGIC PROTEIN RESOURCE- FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE AND- OUR COMMUNITIES FOREVER IN IN. I THANK YOU SO MUCH KATE JOHN NOAH PRESHEAF YOUR HARD WORK IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR FIGHT IN ADVOCACY WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH LAYS IN GENERAL WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD TO OUR THIRD PANEL IT'S GOING TO FOCUS ON THE CRAFT ENTRY WAY ON TANGLING- WE'RE GONNA HEAR AN UPDATE FROM THE WORKING GROUP AND OF COURSE ON ALL ISSUES OF RAMP. UP WE'RE GONNA AT CLASS ASK FOR A QUICK AUDIBLE BECAUSE WE'VE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GONNA NEED TO BE A- CATCH A FLIGHT TO LAST FLIGHT OUT TO SEATTLE TODAY. SO AFTER OF THE CRAB FISHERY WELL TANGLING IN RAMP UP THE PANEL WE'RE GONNA MOVE IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH EVERYONE. THE AQUACULTURE- IN LEGISLATIVE UPDATE PANEL. NEXT AFTER THIS I JUST SO- RAIN IS ABLE TO CATCH THAT FLIGHT. ALL RIGHT IF WE COULD HAVE- DOCTORS IN TORA PLEASE COME FORWARD- GEORGE BRADSHAW THE PRESS IN THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION FISHERMAN'S ASSOCIATION PLEASE COME FORWARD. IF WE GET BEN PLATT THE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CRAP ASSOCIATION TO PLEASE ADVANCE AT THIS TIME. AND THEN WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT CHEN HUMBERSTONE IS HERE SHE'S A FISHERIES PROJECT DIRECTOR. THE NATURE CONSERVANCY SHE COULD ALSO COME FORWARD- WE WANNA. TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BOTH PRESIDENTS MISTER PLAQUE MISTER BRAD SHOP. WHO ARE HERE REPRESENTING BOTH ASSOCIATIONS AND- CRESCENT CITY RESIDENTS SO- PRETTY COOL THAT BOTH YOUR HERE TODAY IN THANK YOU. VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. A GENTLEMAN. FIRST AND FOREMOST- WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER TO DOCTOR JEERED TEN TORE UP- FROM KNOW WHAT FISHERIES HE CAN BE HE'S AN ECOSYSTEM SCIENTISTS. AND OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER AT THE DOCTOR'S GOING TO HAVE TEN MINUTES THE REMAINING PAYMENTS WILL HAVE FIVE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS WE WERE COMMITTEE. IF YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE DRUG COMMITTEE MY NAME MY NAME IS JARED SANTA. A MANY CAUSES SCIENTISTS WITH NO A FISHERIES THE FISHERIES ECOLOGY DIVISION THE SOUTHWEST FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER LOCATED IN SANTA CRUZ CALIFORNIA. I'M ALSO A SCIENTIFIC ADVISER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB WELL ENTANGLEMENT WORKING GROUP. THANK YOU FOR THE REQUESTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. TESTIMONY REGARDING MARINE ECOSYSTEM SCIENCE IN THE RECENT INCREASE OF WELL ENTITLEMENTS. NO WAS VISION IS AN INFORMED SOCIETY THAT USES COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE THE OCEANS COASTS. AND ATMOSPHERE IN THE GLOBAL ECOSYSTEM TO MAKE THE BEST SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DECISIONS. NO WAS MISSION IS TO UNDERSTAND AND PREDICT CHANGES IN THE EARTH'S ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL NEED SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY A BRIEF SUMMARY REGARDING HOW THE SCIENCE. WE'D OF THAT WE TELL UP THIS HELPING TO BENEFIT WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES IN THE CALIFORNIA CURRENT ECOSYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH THOSE VISION AND- MISSION STATEMENTS. MY COLLEAGUES AND I RESPUBLIKA TO STUDY DESCRIBING ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS WITHIN THE CURRENT CAP FOR CURRENT SYSTEM. RECENT HE WAVED 1-000-142-2000 SIXTEEN. OUR RESEARCH PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK ON HOW TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COMPLEX ISSUES ARISING FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. FISHERY CONFLICTS ARE PROTECTED SPECIES SUCH AS I ONE TIME WOMEN'S HOW OCEAN ECOSYSTEM MONITORING DATA CAN BE USED TO BENEFIT DECISION MAKING. REGARDING FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND IMPORTANTLY HOW WE CAN BETTER COMMUNICATE AND USE SCIENCE TO DETECT AND MITIGATE FUTURE RISK TO WILDLIFE AND ARE FISHING COMMUNITIES. QUESTION WATER WELLS INCREASE CAUGHT IN CRAB FISHING GEAR DURING THIS PERIOD BECAUSE OF AN UNPRECEDENTED WARMING EVENT INFLUENCED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. IN FACT THE PROBLEM WELL ENTITLEMENT THAT ALSO EXISTED FOR DECADES AT A VERY SMALL LEVEL IN OUR COASTAL ECOSYSTEM. THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE MARINE HEAT WAVE ANOTHER WARMING EVENTS- AND OTHER FACTORS REPRESENTED TO SOME EXTENT AND EMERGING A NEW EMERGING PROBLEM. FOR WHICH COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING GREATLY BENEFITED FROM ECOSYSTEM SCIENCE. I'D LIKE TO SUMMARIZE FOUR POINTS FOR MORE STUDY. CLIMATE CHANGE AN INCREASED VARIABILITY IN INTENSITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IS INCOME COMBINATION WITH RECOVERING PROTECTED SPECIES POPULATIONS AND HIGHLY CAPITALIZE FISHERIES ARE POSING NEW CHALLENGES FOR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. THIS IS THE CAR PROBLEM I THINK LINKS TO ALL OF OUR OUR CONCERNS FISHER THAT WE'RE WE'RE TALKING. TODAY WE OBSERVE HAVE BACK IN. COAST WHAT. ENGINES FELL ABILITY OF FOR SPECIES SUCH AS KRILLIN. IN SORT AND ADD SHORT TO BE SHIFT FORWARD IN WALES THIS WAS COINCIDENT BUT OF A- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SHIPPED THAT WE SHOULD THE- DID IN PREVIOUS. YEARS WE PROPOSE THAT THESE BECAUSE CHANGES COMBINED WITH RECOVER WELL POPULATIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THE EXACERBATING OF ENTITLEMENTS ROUTE THE MARINE HEATWAVE WAS THE PROBLEM WITH THE- CELL IT WAS TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE ECOSYSTEM SHE THAT OCCURRED IN R. COASTAL WATERS. WE PRESENT A RETROACTIVE ASSESSMENT OF ENTANGLEMENT. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT COOPERATION OF TEACHERS RESOURCE MANAGERS AND BUYING COULD COME TO THE MINUTE IF YOU THINK. AND TANK THE REST BY THE- BECAUSE RAY. FISHER APPROACHES TWICE A THRIVING FOR COMMUNITY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS THIS IS THE BEST. AVAILABLE SCIENCE THAT WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR ENSURING FOR TO APPLY. AND WE TO BE A DOT ABOUT. IN OTHER WORDS A RE LIEU. HOW MARINE HEATWAVE ALTERS THE STRUCTURE IN AREAS OF UP WELLING HABITAT OFF CALIFORNIA. COASTAL UPWELLING IS THE PROCESS BY WIND BLOWING ALONG THE COAST AND THEY DRIVE THIS DEEP COLD NUTRIENT RICH WATER TO RISE TO THE SURFACE THIS NORMALLY. RESULTS IN AN EXPANSION OF THIS COOL OF RICH FOOD WEB THAT EXPANDS A HUNDRED KILOMETERS OFF THE COAST THAT'S THE TYPICAL CASE WHAT. DURING THE MARINE HEATWAVE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO WEEK TWO. PERFECTLY DESCRIBED THAT BECAUSE OUR NORMAL INDICES ARE JUST LOOKING AT THE MAGNITUDE OF UP WELLING IT'S NOT LOOKING AT THE SPECIAL FOOT PRINT OF THE UP WELLING HABITAT. SO DURING THE MARINE HE WAY WHAT WE NOTICE WAS THIS EXTREME COMPRESSION OF THAT COOL UP WORLD WATER HABITAT ALONG THE COAST JUST TO A NARROW BAND. AND THAT CAUSES- AN ECOSYSTEM SHIFT AND THE ESSENTIALLY THE OFFSHORE ORGANISMS ARE MOVING IN SHORE AND THE CLUSTER IN THE ONLY AVAILABLE COOL HABITAT SO YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS A REFUGE IF YOU WILL. THE CALIFORNIA CRAB FISHERY WHICH TYPICALLY OPENS IN MID NOVEMBER AND BY LATE WINTER AND EARLY SPRING THE CATCH IS A REALLY LOW AND MOST OF THE GEAR HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE WATER SO WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD. PROBLEMS IN THE PAST WITH RICK WAVES BECAUSE IT I'M SHIFTING USING THIS. TWO THOUSAND IN DUE TO THE DELAY OPENING THE CRAB FISHING SEE. ALL THE FISHING GEAR WHEN OUR RIGHT DOOR THE PEAK OR- OF WALES SO THIS MADE WORSE WHILE SHORT INCREASE IN ENGLAND SIT. WITH UNFORTUNATE HI CAUGHT TENSION MAN MADE DISEASE AND THE- TWO THOUSAND. IS NOT THE HOLES. IN FACT WE START SEEING. IN THE SPIKE AROUND EGGMAN LATER THE FOR TEAM. WELL BEFORE THE BLADE CRABS NOT. STAND AS THE RESULTS OF HOW THE FEEDING IF YOU'RE- WAY. THE. THROUGHOUT THE ENSURING OFF YOUR HABITS COLLECTIVELY MOVED IN SHORT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE FOOD WAS THE CRUEL THAT THE NORMALLY FEED ON THE OFF SHORE ENVIRONMENTS IS MUCH MORE WIDELY DISBURSING THE OUTER SHELF BRAKES TO A QUESTION YES TO TALK RIGHT I'M INTERRUPTING I REALLY DO SPACE ONE MAKE SURE I'M- E. MADE A COMMENT. SO IT EVERYONE. ALL SPECIE. CROWDED UP CLOSER TO SHORE. RIGHT OUT WHERE TRAPS ARE ALSO BEING DRAFT. IT'S NOT ABOUT HAVING COOL WATER CLOSE TO THE SHORE EIGHT DIGIT WALKING THROUGH THAT ONE MORE TIME. I'M GOING TO GET TO IT AGAIN IN A MOMENT OF THIS HOME BYE BYE BIRDIE HAPPY TO DO THIS OF IT. BUT SO WHEN WE HAVE A HE WAY YEP THIS ON SHORE WHICH IS. YOU KNOW JUST FROM AFTER GLOBAL WAR THAT'S BECAUSE THE NOR PACIFIC WARM THAT WE WAR FROM THE OFF SHORE ENVIRONMENT ENCROACHES ON THE BOUNDARY OF OUR UP WELL WATER WHICH IS IDENTIFIED PARTICULAR ISOTHERM JUST DEGREES CELSIUS SO THAT WARM WATER SHRINKS HELPS PUSH THAT COLD RECLINING AGAINST THE COAST THAT'S THE NARROW BAND THAT'S THE ACTUAL MECHANISM. OF HABITAT COMPOUND. THIRTEEN THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. WELL WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN THE TO THE THIS AND MOM THIS IN REAL NOW THAT'S OF WHAT RESEARCH ABOUT HAS ITS FASTEN THOUGH COST DOCTOR IT I THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. WHAT THE REALLY THE KEY IT'S THE- OF WHY IT'S JUST NUMBER OF WELLS THERE'S ALWAYS TO BE. OR WELL OUT. OFF OUR COAST MAYBE EVEN MORE WHICH REALLY THIS. CHAIN IN THE UP WELLING HABITAT AND DYING OF THE- IT'S THERE ARE. SITE POST THE GREATEST CON. BETWEEN A CRAB YEAR AND POTENTIAL WELL AND TRYING SO THE HAVE COMPRESSION INDEX IT'S JUST. TIMES IT ACTUALLY. THE VERY. OF THAT UP WELL TO WATER AND IT'S NOW WE CAN'T YOU THIS SINGLE. WE HAVE A GOING BACK TO THE EIGHT RIVER LONG TERM OF IT. IT'S A TIME ZERO PROVIDES A NEW. REAL TIME MAJOR OF UP WELLING HAVE THAT'S NOT AND I'D THAT WE CAN. THAT TOOL TO DETECT FUTURE LIMITS. IN THE HABITAT FOR WELL AND OUR SHOES AND FISHED OUT COMMUNITIES. THE RESULTS OF STUDY DATA PEAK OF MANY THERE'S HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS TO HELP ME. ENTANGLED REST IT'S TI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; VALUE THAT. OPS ARE. IN MY- DAY BE YOU TO GUIDE DECISION MAKING. WE HAVE THE- TO Mà THE- CLIMATE CAN. AND NOR PACIFIC AN OFF TELL. A REMARKABLE REST. AND WE ARE A TO TRY FUTURE MARINE HEAT WAVE WE CAN SEE THE MONTH IN ADVANCE. DEVELOPING AND WE HAVE SATELLITES AND TOOLS TO TRACK THE THINGS. WELL AS WELL AS THE L. NAY. THEIR IMPACT ON UP ON. SO ARE STILL FOCUS ON DEVELOP A RE TO. OF THE- INDICATOR. IN PARTICULAR. THE HABIT SECOND. AND WHICH I HAPPEN. NOW TO ROUTINELY UP. FOR MONITORING AND WE BUILDING A WEB AND IT'S GOING TO RELEASED HAS ALL. THE OF THESE. FULL TRANCE. ALL THE ON. DATA THE OLDER REACH WHY IN THE THREE. THAT. IT'S REALLY VALUABLE FOR MONITORING SINCE SOME RUN OUT OF TIME I AM I. A I'LL SKIP AHEAD INTO CONTINUE TO FOR ON THE BUT TOOLBAR THAT WE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE RELEVANT ISSUE FOR TODAY HEARING. I BELIEVE THAT THESE. IN THE- AND BASIC AND- IN TELE ON MONITORING. THESE HELP SET THE GUARD. FOR DECISION MAKING YOU WANT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO OUR FISHER'S OR WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO WALES YOU CAN'T DO IT IN THE BUNKER INSIDE THE CAPITOL BUILDING. BEING COMPLETO COMPLETELY SOME YOU KNOW. GET NOT HAVING THE BASIC ENVIRONMENT ECOSYSTEM INFORMATION COMING IN THAT GUY. I WAS OF HIS DECISION. AND THE RE WHY TO JUST. THIS LESS. IS THE CURRENT. I AM REGULATE THAT I LET SAW A JANUARY AND NATURAL SHE- OF THE RAMP AS- AS ITS NOW. IS NO LONGER INCLUDE OCEAN ECOSYSTEM AND FOR DINE OUT. AND IT'S FUTURE STRAW PERSON PAUL THAT WHATEVER THEY'VE BEEN PRODUCING. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO URGE THIS INFORMATION. IS AVAILABLE IT'S THE KERR THE BAY AVAILABLE SCIENCE THAT WE HAVE. AND IT SHOULD BE USED AND THEY'VE SORT OF DECISION MAKING AND- COMMUNICATION AND BUILDING THIS- COALITION OF THE FISHING COMMUNITY SCIENTISTS RESOURCE MANAGERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER IS A VALUABLE ASSET THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN. RAP SO BY MATTER TIME ALL I'LL JUST PAUSE THERE AND SHIPPED OVER NOW I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GONNA SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN A- THAT. REALLY GOOD SIR IN GRAPE FOR YOUR READ AND WE DO A SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU WERE YOU CAN TURN OVER THE FIRST GEORGE BRAG I HE IS THE- OF A COAST BETTER OF FISHERMEN'S. CAN HEAR FROM BEEN PLAY. AT THE CALIFORNIA CO CRAP ASSOCIATION YOU FIVE MINUTES MISTER. IN THE RETURN OF ROOMS. RIGHT NOW. YOUR LIKE YOU SAY I'M MY NAME'S GEORGE BRADSHAW LEARN PRESS OF PEACE YOU HAVE A FAIR WHY. FOR THIRD GEN. HAVE TWO YOUNG. FOREIGN TO. YOU MIGHT. I THINK IS GOOD TO BE MORE THE LINES OF WORK TRUCK STOP WITH HOPE. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THAT I'M NOT A- MADE. I AM A FOR FISHERMEN AND. AND YOU'LL COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR PROBLEM OF MARINE MAMMAL WELL ENTANGLEMENTS AND- YOU KNOW. THE FULLY AS BEN DEL PROFOUND CHANGES AND WE'RE LOOKING AT TAKING YOU KNOW A NEW APPROACH IN THE WAY THAT WE- OPERATE. AND YOUR THE COOPERATION WITH THE STATE AND THE DEPARTMENT- YOU KNOW. WE LOOK FORWARD TO DEALING WITH TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A WORKS THIS THIS THIS PROCESS HOUSE TO WORK FOR US IN OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU KNOW TALK AND SAKE. AND THE MEMBERS ARE A PART FOR YOU ALL THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT THEY'RE PUTTING IN I LIKE TO THINK YOU. AND VICE CHAIR AND TOM YOU KNOW FOR GIVING US THIS FORMING A PLATFORM TO TALK AND YOU'LL MAKE IT REAL TO PEOPLE- YOUR RAMPS THE RAMP RENT REGULATIONS OF CAME A LONG WAYS- FROM THE FIRST ROUND. AND YOUR WAITING HERE TO SEE THE THIRD ROUND OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO EVERYONE BECAUSE THAT'S NO THREE ROUNDS OF PRE PRE ROUNDING BEFORE WE GET TO THE FIRST REAL ROUND AT. AT YES LEE AND BURDEN AND NEED TO KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT COMES OUT I. YOUR AYE A- I'D ALSO LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT IT DOES AFFECT YOU KNOW I WAS BROUGHT UP WE TALK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT TODAY YEAH I MEAN AND I WOULD LOVE TO SET YOU CAN TALK TO YOU GUYS FOR AN HOUR ABOUT EVERY ISSUE THAT'S BEEN PRODUCT BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS ME IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW CRAB- YOU KNOW BUT THE PANEL THAT I'VE BEEN HERE TO TALK ABOUT IS YOU KNOW. THE RAMP PROGRAM AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AT THE RAMP. AND THE WELL WORKING GROUP. TO REMAIN IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT YOU OFFER ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND FOR BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT CREATIVE WAYS THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX OF KEEPING THE FLEET. ON THE WATER. AND ALSO YOU KNOW TRYING TO AVOID YOU KNOW INTERACTIONS WITH. THE MARINE MAMMAL THE GOOD THING IS AND IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONE THE WELL POPULATION IS GROWING I MEAN NOT AS A BENEFIT FOR ALL WE JUST NEED TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK FLEXIBLY AROUND THAT. YEAH WE NEED TO BUILD WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IN THIS IN THIS RANT PROPOSAL THERE'S NO FLEXIBILITY IN IT AND WE NEED TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THE HARD CAPS YOU KNOW IT THE OCEAN IS A WONDERFUL THING LIKE HE WAS JUST EXPLAINING IT CHANGES CONSTANTLY YEAH I MEAN WHEN WE GET HARD CAPPED THAT THAT THE OLD. MINES OUR HANDS FROM STRAIN AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND THE OLD MAYBE RELAX ON SOME OF THESE HARD CAPS MOVING FORWARD IN THESE AROUND PROPOSALS. DR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO REITERATE ONE MORE TIME YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE THIS WORK IN THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES WHICH YOU GUYS REPRESENTS THE- A IT'S MAKE OR BREAK FOR THEM YEAH I MEAN IT. IT'S GONE. YOU KNOW TO WHERE THERE ISN'T A WHOLE LOT THERE HANGING ON TO YOU I MEAN A GOES LIKE I'VE SAID THIRD GENERATION I'VE GOT BOYS WHICH- YOU'LL MAY OR MAY NOT FISH- YOU KNOW AND I. WILL GO BACK TO WHERE I STARTED THIS WITH AS WITH HELP YOU I MEAN THE REASON WHY I'M HERE I DROVE DOWN FROM CRESCENT CITY I'VE- IN THE STATE CAPITAL IS TO. YOU KNOW CONVEY THAT WE ARE HOPEFUL FOR A SOLUTION THAT YOU KNOW WILL BE WORKABLE FOR ALL. SPREAD YOUR WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK ADVOCACY AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP- IN SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND IT IS A HELL OF A DRIVE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. THERE YOU GO- AND- THE GERMAN THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO HEAR FROM MR PLATT- DRUG JUST AS FAR AND IT WAS REALLY NICE TO MEET- DESPLAT LAST NIGHT. AT TO AT DINNER AS WELL- ENDED HE'S PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAP ASSOCIATION. SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. THANKS MIKE TOM AND MARK- I ALSO AM A MULTI GENERATIONAL COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN- SECOND GENERATION I'M THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST GRAVEL SO SEASON THE TRIPLE CA IS THE FIRST EVER STATEWIDE INDUSTRY ONLY COMMERCIAL CRAB FISHING TRADE ASSOCIATION IN HISTORY CALIFORNIA. JOINT PLEASE PULL THAT MIKE A LITTLE CLOSER YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE ARE INDIVIDUAL CRAB BOAT OWNERS HARD CAPTAINS AND BUYERS EIGHT MEMBER BOARD OF THE TRIPLE CA AS A COMBINED TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS A CRAB FISHING EXPERIENCE. OUR MEMBERSHIP COMPRISES A MAJORITY OF CRAP PRODUCTION THE STATE AND ARE BUYING MEMBERSHIPS ALSO MAJORITY OF CRABS ARE CAUGHT HERE. OUR MEMBERS COME FROM EVERY CRAP PORT ON THE COAST FOR MALLET CRESCENT CITY AND RAIN FROM THE SMALLEST BOATS WITHOUT BIRD MOTORS TO THE BIGGEST BOATS THE HARDLINERS ON THE COAST. THE TRIPLE CA FORMED. AFTER THE- OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT FROM CBT VERSUS BONHAM. THIS IS THE WORST THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO THE CRAB FISHERY IN ITS IN ITS HISTORY IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS FOR US. WE ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE TO HELP CITY OF W. NAVIGATE THROUGH THE ESSAY PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN. TRIGGERED BY THIS LAWSUIT IN A WAY THAT CAN BOTH. PRESERVE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY THE FISHERY WHILE ALSO MITIGATING THE RISK OF MARINE MAMMAL INTERACTIONS. THE FACT IS THAT THE CRAB FISHERY AND THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WORKING SUCCESSFULLY FOR YEARS TO MINIMIZE THESE INTERACTIONS. WITH THE HELP OF STATE LEGISLATURE AND DUNGEON IT'S CRAP TASK FORCE. BEFORE THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY CITED THAT INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH INDUSTRY THEY WANTED TO BURN IT TO THE GROUND. BECAUSE IN REALITY CBT VERSUS BONHAM AND SHE WOULD BE STRONG ARMED OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT. IS NOTHING SHORT OF NEW IN A SCENE OVERREACH OF FISHERY REGULATIONS. IT'S MOST OBVIOUS ISN'T OBVIOUS PRESIDENT IS THE S. A LAWSUIT OVER SPOTTED OWL HABITAT WHICH- WHICH DESTROYED CALIFORNIA DECIMATING THE ECONOMIES OF OUR COASTAL TOWNS. A FEW OF THE MEMBERS BIRTH FIRST WHO WENT ON TO START T. B. D. HAVE PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEY HAD IT HIT UPON A WINNING PLAY WHEN THEY REALIZE THAT THEY COULD USE YES AND ITS DESIGNATION OF CRITICAL HABITAT. AS A WEAPON TO MAKE THE AGENCIES QUOTE BAND TO THEIR WILL. CBT HAS BEEN USING THE SAME STRATEGY EVER SINCE IN A NONSTOP CAMPAIGN AGAINST SMALL FAMILY FARMS RANCHES TIMBER HARVESTERS AND FISHERMEN. THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH FOR C. B. D. AND FOR NO A TODAY IS. IN THE CASE OF THIS FISHERY ACTUAL CONFIRMED ENTANGLEMENTS BETWEEN COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB GEAR. AND MARINE MAMMALS. OF THAT ARE EITHER ESA LISTENER THREATENED UNDER THE UNDER THE DISTINCT POPULATION SEGMENTS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT TO THE HEALTH OR SIZE OF THESE POPULATIONS ALL OF THE DOMINANT POPULATION GROUPS A WELL SAID MARGARET OFF BECAUSE CALIFORNIA FOR PART OF EVERY YEAR ARE ROBUST IN THE HUMPBACK POPULATION IS GROWING AT A RATE OF 8210% A YEAR. THIS EVEN WHILE THE SHIPPING INDUSTRY OFFER COAST. HAS ADMITTED PUBLIC T. PUBLICLY TO RUNNING DOWN SCORES WELLS EVERY YEAR AS USUAL THE NGOS AND NO ARE GOING AFTER THE LOW HANGING FRUIT. NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THE CULPRITS BUT BECAUSE THE IMAGE OF A WHALE ENTANGLED IN A BLUE LINE FITS THE DESIRED OPTICS. APPARENTLY CVD MADE THE CALCULATION THAT COMMERCIAL CRABBING. CRABBERS ARE DISORGANIZED UNDERFUNDED AND DEFENSELESS. WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS TIME CVD. AND THEIR COHORTS HAVE PICKED THE WRONG GROUP OF FISHERMEN TO TRY TO PUT OUT OF BUSINESS THE BUCK STOPS HERE TODAY WITH THE LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE OF THE TRIPLE CA WHERE A WELL ORGANIZED WELL FUNDED AND WELL POSITIONED TO GO TO THE MAT. TO PROTECT. OUR JOBS AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. THE TRIPLE CA IS WORKING WITH THE TOP EXPERTS ON IS A LEGAL PROCESS AND FISHERIES IN THE NATION RYAN STEEN AND IT'S CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATE DANIEL QUICKLY. OF THE STORIES GROUP. E HAVE AN EXPERT SCIENCE TEAM HEADED UP BY MERYL ROAD. OF THE UNITED UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON WHO IS A RISING STAR IN THE MARINE SCIENCE COMMUNITY. WE ARE ALREADY FULLY ENGAGED IN THE WELL WORKING GROUP AND HELPING GUIDE TO DFW AND CRAFTING FAIR AND FLEXIBLE RAMP GUIDELINES. TRIPLE CA MEMBERS OCCUPIED TWELVE OF THE THIRTEEN INDUSTRY SEATS ON THE WORKING GROUP. WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING FOCUS RESEARCH ON RISK FACTOR ASSESSMENT FLEET AND FISHING DYNAMICS AND A COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF DUNGENESS CRAB. TO THE ECONOMIES OF OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. ABOUT ONE MINUTE OKAY. THE TROUBLE CA ONE CDF W. AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE. TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE THEIR ALLIES NOT THEIR ADVERSARIES. AND THAT OUR GOAL IS TO CONVINCE SHE DFW THAT THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR AN I. T. P. FROM NO FOR THE CRAB FISHERY IS A NEGOTIATION AND NOT A HARD DICTATE HEADED DOWN FROM UP HIGH. OUR YES SAY EXPERTS CAN HELP CFW NAVIGATE THROUGH THE PROCESS TO AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE CRAB FISHERY THAT PROTECTS BOTH. OUR COASTAL ECONOMIES AND YES A LIST AND MARINE MAMMALS. WE WOULD LIKE CITY OF W. TO LET US HELP THEM. AND LET THEM HELP US IT I'M ALSO EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE OF TRIPLE CA IS SPONSORING AND COORDINATING THE COAST WIDE LOST YOUR RECOVERY PROGRAM THE GOAL OF ZERO LOST YOUR LEFT IN THE OCEAN AFTER THE END OF CRAB SEASONS I BELIEVE THAT'S AN ACHIEVABLE GOAL WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH A MANDATORY CERTIFICATION TRAINING PROGRAM FOR CRAB BOAT SKIPPERS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE FLEET IS CONFIGURING THE GEAR AND FISHING IN WAYS THAT ARE PROVEN TO MINIMIZE RISK OF INTERACTIONS THIS CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WOULD ALSO INCLUDE DISSENTING WITH TRAINING FOR CAPTAINS OF LARGER STEELER FAR BEST VESSELS THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO WORK AND OTHER FISHERIES IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF SOME OF THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT OPC IS CONSIDERING TO AND I CANYON. IS ON OTHER. THAT MAKE NO SENSE AT ALL TO FISH MINUTE AND WON'T HELP LIKE ROPE WAS HERE. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE OPC TO INSTEAD HELP FACILITATE THE TESTING OF OUR OWN IDEAS FOR GEAR MODIFICATIONS. AND FOR CDF W. TO ALLOW TESTING ON OUR OWN BOAT IN SEASON. GOT ONE MORE HAVE A MINUTE REALLY QUICK OKAY. I'VE BEEN HEARING WE WERE IN THE LAST DAYS OF COMMERCIAL FISHING SINCE I WAS NINE YEARS OLD WHEN WAREHOUSE OR CORPORATION FIRST STARTED FARMING SALMON BUT AT THE HAD A RICH AND REWARDING LIFE AND COMMERCIAL FISHING DURING THE FORTY NINE YEARS SINCE THEN. SO OBVIOUSLY I'M AN OPTIMIST AND THE TRIPLE CA IS HOPEFUL THAT OUR INDUSTRY CAN GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS TO COME OUT THE OTHER END WITH THE REAL NOT TOKEN COMMERCIAL FISHERY BUT WE WILL NEED THE FULL SUPPORTOF THIS COMMITTEE THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION CDF W. TO GET THERE. AND SO WE- ARE COMMITTED TO THE GOAL OF THIS NOT BECOMING THE FISHING INDUSTRY SPOTTED DAHLE. R. COSTA COMMUNITY SIMPLY CAN'T HANDLE. ANYMORE LOSS OF REAL JOBS. I'D I'D RECENTLY MOVED BACK TO THE NORTH COAST AFTER GOING TO HUMBOLDT STATE. BACK IN THE EIGHTIES. AND YOU CAN STILL SEE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE- DEVASTATION THE TIMBER INDUSTRY IN IN THESE COASTAL BOUNCE A CHRONIC UNEMPLOYMENT. UNDEREMPLOYMENT HOMELESSNESS DRUG ADDICTION. PLACE LIKE CRESCENT CITY WE HAVE TO INDUSTRIES A PRISON AND COMMERCIAL FISHING. AND SEASONAL TOURISM. IF WE CAN'T GET THROUGH THIS AND THE DEVIL IS REALLY GONNA BE IN THE DETAILS OF HOW THIS COMES OUT THE DETAILS ARE GOING TO MATTER. AND SO WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS WITH THE RIVER. DUNGEON AS CRAB FISHERY PLACES LIKE TRINIDAD YOUR- CITY. ARE YOU. WOULD BE TROUBLE. SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE CONTINUE SUPPORT THANK YOU SO MUCH BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU HERE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TRACK IS WELL WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL. WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL MEMBER OF THE PANEL IT'S GEN HUMBERSTONE SHE'S THE FISHERIES PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. IN WELCOME TO COMMITTEE THE FORESHORES YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES ON AB ONE MINUTE PROMPT. THANK YOU- THANKS AGAIN SEVEN REQUIRE INTO THE JOINT COMMITTEE. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S PANEL. SHE SAID MY NAME IS JOHN HUMBERSTONE OF TREES PROJECT DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. TNC HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH CALIFORNIA JUDGES CRAB FISHERMEN IN MANAGE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. IN TANGLED ARREST ELLSWORTH COURTING A THRIVING FISHERY. I TAKE IN THE FACE OF CHANGING CLIMATE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS. FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY THE WAY TO DO THAT IS BY BRINGING MORE COOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN FUNDING TO THE TABLE. BY LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS AND BY ENSURING WE HAVE HIGH QUALITY INFORMATION TO ACT ON. THEIR SCIENCE AND IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION. THIS IS BETTER APPROACH WORKING WITH THE DENTIST CRAP FISHERY. WE'VE INVESTED IN THE DUNGEON ASCRIBE FISHING YOU'RE WORKING ROUP AND COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE RAMP. WE'VE PARTNERED WITH NO WAY TO EXPAND THE ENTANGLEMENT RESPONSE NETWORK AND REDESIGNED THAT WE'LL TRACKING TOOL THAT THEY USE TO FREE ENTANGLED WHALES. AND WE PARTNERED WITH THE HALF MOON BAY COMMERCIAL FISHERIES TRUST AND MEMBERS OF THE HAPPY BAY SEAFOOD MARKETING ASSOCIATION TO NINE. AND THREE LEAD MANTA. MODEL FOR. HERE INITIATIVES HAVE. THE EFFECTIVE OF THE APPROACH AND WE THINK THEY CAN SERVE AS A MODEL FOR ADDRESSING A TANGLE RISK ON THE WEST COAST. FIVE YEARS INTO OUR PARTNERSHIP IN AN INDUSTRY LED COMMERCIAL LOSSKY RECOVERY PROGRAM WE'VE EXPANDED THE PROGRAM'S OPERATION THE TWO MAJOR CRAP PORTS. WE'VE DEVELOPED A WEAPON PHONE APPLICATION THAT PROVIDES FOR STREAMLINED TRACKING OF GEAR FROM OUT SEE RECOVERY TO FINAL DISTRIBUTION. AND WE SUPPORTED THE CREATION OF REGULATIONS FORMALIZING THIS PROGRAM. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE WERE COVERED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED LOS POTS. THIS YEAR WITH TRIPLE CA LEADERSHIP. WE'RE HOPING TO EXPAND THE INDUSTRY LEAD PROGRAM UP THE COAST. WE ALSO PLAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT REGULATION SUPPORT AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAM OPERATION AND EFFICIENT REPORTING. WE THINK THIS PROGRAM IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR MARINE LIFE AND ARE FISHING COMMUNITIES. AND WE THINK IT'S A STRONG COMPLEMENT TO AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT APPROACH AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE RAMP. THE WORKING AS AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT ENTITY. AND THEY CREATED THE RAMP AS A FIRST OF ITS KIND ADOPTIVE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL. DRIVING SUPPORTING RESEARCH THAT HAS POSITION THE WEST COAST AS A LEADER AND ENTANGLEMENT RISK SCIENCE. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE REGULATIONS TO FORMALIZE THE RAMP TAKE AN ADAPTIVE APPROACH INCLUDING A MEANINGFUL ROLE FOR THE WORKING GROUP AND USE OF ALL BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. OUR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THIS DYNAMIC ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND THE RAMP REGULATIONS MUST BE WRITTEN TO ADOPT WITH THIS PROGRESS IN THE WAY REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN MATTERS. WRITING THE RAMP REGULATIONS USING STANDARDS ALLOWS US TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADAPT AS WE GAME BETTER SCIENCE AND MORE INFORMATION. IF WE'VE LEARNED HUNTING IT'S THAT THIS IS A DYNAMIC SITUATION AND WE NEED TO AVOID OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE AND REGULATIONS. THE FISHERMAN MANAGERS ARE BETTER PREPARED FOR CHANGE. DOCTOR CENTER IS RESEARCH PRESENTED HERE TODAY IS A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF INFORMATION WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PULL UP TO THE RAMP. AND ADOPTED REGULATIONS ARE BUT A LOT TO. WE ENCOURAGE THE HERE- FROM DIRECTOR BONTA FROM THE DEPARTMENT EARLIER THAT. ROB DATED REGULATIONS INTEND TO BE INCLUSIVE OF. ALL BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND WE'VE HEARD THAT THAT WILL INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF OCEANOGRAPHIC AND FORAGE CONDITIONS. AND FISHING DYNAMICS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE INDICATION THE UPDATED REGULATIONS WILL BETTER TO FIND THE ROLE THE WORKING GROUP AND WE BELIEVE THIS SHOULD INCLUDE THE WORKING GROUP'S ROLE AND ASSESSING RISK. PROVIDING MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE ROLE AND CONTINUING TO REFINE THE RAMP AND DRIVING SCIENCE IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY. WITH THIS THERE'S A NEED TO EMPLOY ENSURE THE WORKING GROUP HAS A PLAN TO BE ADEQUATELY RESOURCE. WE BELIEVE THE SHOULD INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR NATURE FACILITATION WHICH HAS BEEN CRUCIAL TO THE SPONSOR BODY. WE APPRECIATE YOUR ONGOING LEADERSHIP. CENTER REQUIRE AND OF THE OPC. INCLUDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS FORMALIZING THE RAMP AND THE LOST YOUR RECOVERY PROGRAM WE ALSO SUPPORT YOUR CURRENT BILL SB ONE ONE TWO EIGHT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE PARTNERSHIP WITH MANAGERS THE OPC FISHERMEN SCIENTISTS AND NGOS AS WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE COOPERATIVE ADAPTIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR MARINE LIFE AND OUR FISHERIES. THANK YOU FOR BEING SUCH A GREAT PLAYER HERE TODAY YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU WOULD OPEN UP TO PAY ANY QUESTIONS MISTER VICE CHAIR AT I THINK JUST A COMMA BECAUSE IT IS COME UP SO SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THIS PANEL BUT IT'S ALSO INHERENT. TO A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN THIS THIS NOTION OF ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND BUILDING AND SOME FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE TOO OFTEN. REGULATORY SCHEMES ARE. SET UP BASED ON AN UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE. AND THEN AS THAT PROGRESSES IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT THAN FOR THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT TO FOLLOW SO SETTING UP A SCHEME THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY. IN ORDER TO KEEP TRACK OF AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE QUICKLY MOVING SCIENCE AS LONG AS WE HAVE A WAY OF BEING ABLE TO VERIFY VALIDATE AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT SCIENCE IS KEEPING UP THAT SHOULD INFORM. THE REGULATORY PROCESS THERE AND- I THINK WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY WITH ESPECIALLY HERE TO BE ABLE TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAT HAS TYPICALLY BEEN DONE. IN GOVERNMENT BEFORE AS LONG AS WE HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT. FROM THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS FROM ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THESE ISSUES. ENSURING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IMPACTS. TALK ABOUT THE SITE AND BRING IN THE SCIENCE AND SO UNLIKE WHAT WE ARE SEEING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE COULD DO SOMETHING. MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY I THINK HERE AND KEEP THE STATE ALSO I THINK NEEDS TO EXPAND ITS ROLE IN. FUNDING EXPERIMENTATION FUNDING SCIENCE AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE KEEPING THAT INFORMATION COMING TO US THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH THAT IS WHEN THINGS THAT. THAT WE IS AS A BODY NEED TO PAY A LITTLE BIT. MORE ATTENTION TO. AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. LOOKING AT ADAPTIVE PRACTICE SAYS AND EVEN STARTING TO SEPARATE IN PERMITTING. WHAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE ENVIRONMENT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT EVERY PERMITTING ACTION AS- WHETHER IT'S POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENT ALL AS THE KIND OF SAME THING SO. WE'RE LEARNING WE'RE TAKING STEPS AND THEN THE THAT'S WHY THIS TESTIMONY AND PERSPECTIVES ARE VERY INFORMATIVE TO US AS WE LOOK FOR TO REALLY MOVING THESE THESE FRAMEWORKS FORWARD AND EVEN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. FISH WILD BY FLOODING THE NEW AIRCRAFT WELL. BY UTILIZING THE SCIENCE IT'S A BIG OCEAN AND IT'S SO IT AND THERE'S A LOT TO LOOK AT OUT THERE. THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE THE BETTER WE CAN DIRECT THOSE RESOURCES TO BE EFFECTIVE. MORE QUICKLY AND- MORE APPROPRIATELY GIVEN THE AND DID WHATEVER THEY THEY THE IMPACTS HAPPENING IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO I. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EACH OF THE PERSPECTIVES HERE I THINK THAT FEEDS IN VERY MUCH WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION EARLIER AND I THINK NOW. FOR US AS WELL SETTING STATUTORY. POLICY AND FRAMEWORK CENTER WHICH REGULATIONS ARE DONE ANY WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF. THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE RELATIONSHIPS THE PARTNERSHIP THE INFORMATION FLOW AND HAVE AS BEST EFFECT AS WE CAN REALLY ACROSS THE BOARD ON THE FISHERIES. THAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THE- TASK FORCE IN LOOKING AT. THE HAVING ALL THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE TABLE AS WE TRY AND SORT THROUGH THE CHALLENGES FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT ALSO AS WE TRY TO MANAGE OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORTY THESE PERSPECTIVES. AND I THINK WE'RE WE HAVE A ROADMAP IF WILL STICK TO IT. THANK YOU MISTER ASHER ANY COMMENTS ON VICE CHAIRS- COMMENTS THAT HE SAID. ANY FEEDBACK. LIKE TO SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE PLANO WE SEEM TO GET CHEN THEM ON THE MIKE IF THAT'S ALRIGHT. SO SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HEAR COMING- FROM OUTSIDE INDUSTRY ARE NOT PRACTICAL AND WOULD ACTUALLY HELP- ADDRESS THE ISSUE ON THE OCEAN- ONE OF THOSE IDEAS IS ROBUST HERE DOT DOT WE THINK WE HAVE MUCH BETTER IDEAS WITHIN INDUSTRY AND- IF YOU LOOK AROUND OTHER FISHERIES THAT HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE S. A. ISSUES AN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT. THE MATH SKILLS USED COME FROM INSIDE INDUSTRY SOMETIMES AS PART PARTNER FOR OUR RESEARCH BETWEEN- DIFFERENT GROUPS BUT ALWAYS TESTED BY FISHERMEN ON THE WATER. WEEK CIRCLE HOOK IN- PELAGIC LONGLINE FISHERY THE TROLL EXCLUDE OR IN THE TRIAL FISHERIES OFF THE WEST COAST THESE ARE SIMPLE PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS AND THAT'S USUALLY WHERE WE'RE GONNA THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO. THAT THE MAGIC PILL HERE IT'S GONNA BE A SIMPLE PRACTICAL LOW COST SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE HUGE MODIFICATION THE GEAR THAT WE ALREADY FISH. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE THE- JUST LOOKING AT MORE CLOSELY. WHETHER IT'S- IT'S NOT EVEN NECESSARILY FINDING IT'S JUST BEING ALLOWED TO GO OUT THERE AND TEST SOME OF OUR OWN IDEAS IMPROVE THAT WHAT DOES AND DOESN'T WORK AND WHAT DIRECTION WE MIGHT WANT TO HEAD WITHOUT. PUTTING A PLANE IN THE AIR TO MONITOR CRAB BOATS WHILE THEY'RE FISHING AND ORCHESTRATOR MOVEMENTS AS A COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL IDEA. THEY WANT TO USE THAT PLAN FOR MORE SURVEYS MORE COMPREHENSIVE WIDER SURVEYS AND BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WELL DYNAMICS RIGHT ON. IF THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA PUT THE PLANE IN THE AIR AN ORCHESTRATED CRAB FLEET THAT'S NOT A CRAB FISHERY WORKS. BUT I THINK THE IDEA IS TO BE MONITORING THE ANIMALS OUT THERE. AND I THINK WE ALSO HAVE. WELL INTENDED TO SERIOUS ISSUE BUT WELL STRIKES FROM SOME OF THE COMMERCIALS THAT NOT THE FISHING INDUSTRY BUT- FROM THE- THE SHIPS THAT ARE OUT THERE. SO THAT AIRCRAFT IS A RESOURCE REALLY TO MONITOR A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IS WHY. THE BETTER WE UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE AND BEHAVIORS AND SO THAT. AS THE WARM WATER AND- COOL WATER OF UP WELLING GIVE US IDEAS OF ZONES TO LOOK AT. TRACKING THE WHALE MOVE MADE COULD BE INFORMATIVE TO YOU. ON THE WATER SO AND IT'S NOT ABOUT TRACKING THE FISHING FLEET AS MUCH AS TRACKING THE WHALES. TO INFORM THE FISHERY ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE FACING A AND IN WHAT THAT LANDSCAPE OUT THERE LOOKS LIKE. TO MAKE DECISIONS THERE SO THAT WE MINIMIZE INTERACTIONS BUT I THINK THE AIRCRAFT IS THE ALSO BORN AND I'M HOPING WILL HELP US WITH THE SHIP STRIKE ISSUE. TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR OTHER SHIPPING AND LAST I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE. A SUBSET OF THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPING. CRAB INDUSTRY HERE. BY MONITORING IF THEY KNOW BETTER WHERE TO LOOK BECAUSE WE'RE USING MORE APPROPRIATE SCIENCE REALLY WAS MY POINT. THAT BACKS GOING TO NARROW. THE KIND OF THEIR TASK AND THEY MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND EASIER TO GET YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED ABOUT THE WELLS AREWHERE THE WELLS ARE SO THAT WE CAN AVOID THE CONFRONTATIONS YEAH- YEAH I'LL JUST CHIME IN AND SAY COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH WHAT YOU'VE SAID ABOUT SCIENCE BEING ABLE TO. STEER OUR RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG BENEFIT- AND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THIS BEING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALLY BE A LEADER. IN DEVELOPING AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT MODEL FOR THIS. THIS DYNAMIC AND REALLY CHALLENGING ISSUE. AND THE BAND'S POINT EXPERIMENTATION AS CRITICAL- THE INDUSTRY'S PERSPECTIVE. IS CRITICAL AND THE INNOVATION THAT WE CAN SEE HERE- COMING OUT OF THIS OUT SEE EXPERIMENTATION IT WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO SOLVING THIS ISSUE AND- WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN EXPERIMENTAL FISHING PERMIT PROGRAM- UNDER DEVELOPMENT HERE AND- AND NOT TO PROVIDE A GOOD POP WAY FOR THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WOULD LIKE TO GO TO MRS IN TORA. TAKING YOUR FINDINGS AND THE DATA. TO BE ABLE TO LOOK. TO MAKING- FUTURE PREDICTIONS ON CONDITIONS COULD BE BAD COULD BE GOOD BUT TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD ABOUT USING- THE DATA AND HOW WE CAN APPLY YOUR RESEARCH TO. HAVING BETTER PREDICTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I THINK OVERALL IT IT REDUCES OUR- FIND UNCERTAINTY IN THE AND INCREASE THEIR BILL ABILITY TO DETECT FALSE POSITIVE SOMEONE I MEAN BY THAT IS SAY SAY WE MAKE A DECISION MARCUS SO WITH THAT DECISION IS BUT THIS IT'S RATHER SEVERE AND- IT'S GONNA HAVE SOME SEVERE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF THE FISHERY I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE OCEAN ENVIRONMENT. IT'S NOT A BLACK BOX WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE OCEAN WE WITH MODERATE ON INCREDIBLE RESOLUTION OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES BUT ULTIMATELY I MEAN THE THING THAT'S MISSING FROM TODAY'S CONVERSATION ARE HEARING RATHER IS CLIMATE IN CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND IT IS INCREASING THERE'S THAT'S A FACT YEAH WITH INREASE CLIMATE VARIABILITY THAT MEANS INCREASED ECOSYSTEM VARIABILITY WHICH MEANS GREATER UNCERTAINTY WE DON'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS YET WE HAVEN'T BUILT THOSE TOOLS. AND I THINK THIS ECHOES BACK TO EARLIER WHEN WE WERE- THE SECRETARY WAS MENTIONING ASPECTS ABOUT- COMPLIANCE SCIENCE INCOME COMBAT SCIENCE THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU HAVE THE MANAGEMENT LEADING THE SCIENCE WE DON'T INVEST IN CREATIVE TRANSFORMATIVE SCIENCE TO SOLVE THESE REALLY CHALLENGING PROBLEMS AND TO DO THIS WE NEED A DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER GROUP WE NEED TO HEAR FROM OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES ARE SCIENTISTS AND A CONSERVATIONIST TOGETHER SO. SPECIFICALLY THE TOOL BOX THAT I CREATED WITH MY COLLEAGUES- THAT IS GOING TO BE LIVE IN A LIVE THERE FOREVER AND MORE MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE THESE LOOMING MAJOR PER PERFECT STORMS IF YOU WILL OF- EITHER A MARINE HEAT WAVE WE HAD ONE LAST YEAR AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE'VE BEEN IN THIS PROLONGED MARINE HEAT WAVE STATE. WE CAN SEE THESE THINGS COMING AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THESE THESE INDICATORS THAT WE DEVELOPED TO PREVENT WHAT HAPPENED DURING TWENTY FOURTEEN SIXTEEN FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN IT WAS UNNECESSARY WE COULD BE SORT COMING IT WAS A FAILURE ON THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY'S PART TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT TO THE RESOURCE MATT AND THAT'S WHY I'M- TO REINSURER THAT. WE DO HAVE THE SCIENCE AND WE CAN. UTILIZE IT NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. LISTEN CHEN ON THE PANEL WE WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE EACH OF YOU BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY YOUR ADVOCACY WE LOOK FOR WORK WITH YOU HERE IN THE MONTHS TO COME. THANK YOU pGONNA BE MOVING FORWARD AS WE TALKED ABOUT. WITH THAT AUDIBLE WE'RE GONNA BE MOVING IN. ITEM NUMBER SIX ON TODAY'S AGENDA. AQUACULTURE LEGISLATIVE UPDATES TO OUR NEXT PANEL. WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE ROB HUCK ROCKS HERE TODAY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ISSUES AND SEE VERY INSTITUTE IN GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ADVISER FOR THE CALIFORNIA AQUACULTURE ASSOCIATION IN ADDITION WE HAVE MARIE THERESE WAS CATCHING A FLIGHT- SO HEAD ON BACK HOME TO SEATTLE I DIRECTOR OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR PACIFIC SEAFOOD BUT WE WANT TAKE MOMENT SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BOTH YOU BEING HERE- EACH OF YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES SO GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE PROMPT. IT REALLY MEANS A LOT- THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME TO BE ABLE TO COME SOUTH- RAIN THAT YOU HAVE THE FLOOR YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES THANK YOU SENATOR GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARIE THERESE AND AS A SENATOR SAID MY NAME IS EXCUSE ME I AM THE DIRECTOR REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR PACIFIC SEAFOOD. I HAVE THE GREAT PLEASURE OF TRAVELLING PACIFIC COAST ON A DAILY BASIS- THROUGH WASHINGTON THE OREGON COAST AND DOWN TO THE CALIFORNIA'S HUMBOLDT BAY. I MYSELF AM IS A FOURTH GENERATION SHELLFISH. FARMER MY GRANDFATHER LIKE MANY IN THIS ROOM. CAME TO THE UNITED STATES SEEKING A BETTER LIFE. AFTER FIGHTING IN WORLD WAR TWO WORLD WAR ONE EXCUSE ME HE CAME TO CITIZENSHIP AND BECAME A FISHMONGER SAVING EVERY PENNY IN TEN YEARS HE WAS ABLE TO EXPAND THE RAPIDLY GROWING SHELLFISH FARMING WORLD. AND BOUGHT HIS OWN FARM. SIMILARLY THE COMPANY I NOW WORK FOR PACIFIC SEAFOOD AND ITS FOUNDERS THE DEL SUCH FAMILY BEGAN WITH MEAGER MEANS AND THROUGH HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITIES IT OPERATES AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO GROW TO OPERATE IN FORTY ONE FACILITIES IN ELEVEN. DIFFERENT STATES. IN MY WILL HOUSE I GET TO MANAGE SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF TIED LANDS. ACROSS THE BUTTE BEAUTIFUL WEST COAST A PRIVILEGE AND AN HONOR THAT I HOLD IN THE HIGHEST REGARD. ADDITIONALLY I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE THIRD TERM PRESIDENT OF THE PACIFIC COAST SHELLFISH GROWERS ASSOCIATION AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS SHELLFISH FARMERS FROM ALASKA OREGON. WASHINGTON HAWAII AND HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE A CALIFORNIA. THIS ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIES INCLUDING OYSTERS CLAMS. AND MUSSELS OR OUR ORGANIZATION ALSO REPRESENTS EVERYONE FROM THE MOM AND POP FARM WHERE EVERY COST NEW REGULATION. IS FELT RIGHT AT THE DINNER PLATE. WE ALSO REPRESENT COMPANIES AS MINE THAT REPRESENT THE BIGGEST INDUSTRIES THAT ALSO FEEL THE SAME BURDEN WE FEEL THE BURDEN OF OVER REGULATION HELPING TO REPRESENTS NOT JUST OURSELVES BUT OUR FELLOW MOM AND POP FARMS. AND OFFERED RESOURCES WHERE OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE LOST. NOT SURE IF EVERYONE IN THE ROOM REALIZES THIS BUT ONE MATURE OYSTER HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE ABILITY TO FILTER FIFTY GALLONS OF WATER EVERY DAY. IN FACT IN ESTUARIES ON THE EAST COAST WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE INVESTMENTS INTO REINTRODUCING OYSTERS INTO THESE WATER BODIES FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE WATER BUT THEY OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SEE HOW WE CAN PULL FARM AND WORK WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT IN OVER BURDENING REGULATORY SCHEME. WATER IS A RESOURCE ONE THAT IS IMPERATIVE TO HUMAN LIFE. SHELLFISH IS A PARTNER IN THAT GOAL SHELLFISH OF SOME OF THE HEALTHIEST PROTEIN ON THIS PLANET. IN FACT SOME THE OYSTERS THAT MANY IN THIS ROOM ENJOYED LAST NIGHT ARE NATURALLY HIGH IN THINGS LIKE ZINC IRON CALCIUM AND B. TWELVE AMONG AMONG OTHER NUTRIENTS. HEARING CALIFORNIA OYSTERS HAVE BEEN PART OF THE CULTURE SINCE THE GOLDRUSH THE ICONIC OLYMPIA OYSTER WAS ALMOST DEPLETED IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS DUE TO THE OVER HARVEST AND MASS. MASSIVE INTO INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE HYDRAULIC MINING RESULTING AND DESTROYING. HABITAT AND OVER SILTING THANKFULLY THAT POPULATION IS RETURNING. TO INTO ICONIC PLACES LIKE THE SAN FRANCISCO HARBOR. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS THE PACIFIC OYSTER WAS ALSO INTRODUCED. INTO THE WATERS OF THE WEST COAST AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DEPLETED OLYMPIA OYSTER THIS SPECIES WAS A ROARING SUCCESS IT GREW FASTER IT GREW BIGGER AND HAD A FLAVOR PROFILE ENJOYABLE. BY A WIDER VARIETY OF PEOPLE AND WE HAVE IT LOOKS BACK. UNTIL NOW. WE'RE FACING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS WITHIN STATE AGENCIES TO FORBID. THE GROWING AND CULTIVATION OF THE PACIFIC OYSTER. AND NATURAL AYE SPECIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED INVASIVE IS REALLY A SAD SAD SHAME. THE PACIFIC OYSTER THE MANILA CLAM IN THE OLYMPIA OYSTER ARE ALL AS WELL AS THE BURGEONING OYSTER NOW BEING GROWN ALL OVER THE GOLDEN STATE THE SHELLFISH INDUSTRY EMPLOYS HUNDREDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH LIVING WAGE JOBS AND OUR BUSINESSES CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE STATE'S TAX REVENUE WITH CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST NIXON'S OF COASTLINE. GROWING SHELLFISH TO FEED CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD IS CLEARLY A GREAT RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER IT'S NOT WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES. WELL THERE FARMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR CLOSE TO A CENTURY NAVIGATING THE REGULATIONS IN THE VAST NUMBER OF AGENCIES INVOLVED IN DUPLICATIVE AND EXPENSE OF PERMITTING IS UNSUSTAINABLE. THANKFULLY LAST YEAR WITH YOUR HELP SENATOR. WITH A UNANIMOUS VOTE THE STATE SENATE PASSED SENATE BILL TWO SIX TWO. REQUIRING AGENCIES LIKE THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OTHERS TO ENGAGE. WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO STREAMLINE AND REMOVED DUPLICATIVE PERMITTING AND MONITORING THE ONE MINUTE. THANK YOU. THE STREAMLINING IS A WIN WIN FOR THOSE AGENCIES AND THE STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE RESOURCES BEING SAFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE BUSINESSES INVOLVED IN THESE ACTIVITIES. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SHELLFISH FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR DILIGENT AND CONTINUED EFFORTS IN GETTING SENATE BILL TWO SIX TWO PASSED YOU HAVE BEEN CONTINUE TO BE A CHAMPION FOR INDUSTRY. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THOSE AGENCIES EVEN THOUGH THAT WORK HAS NOT YET BEGUN. WE HAVE NINE MONTHS LEFT BASED ON WHAT THE WAS WRITTEN IN THAT BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THAT WORK STARTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ADDITIONALLY WOULD LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE CONTINUING FUNDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. RIGHT NOW WE'RE FACING US EXTENSION CRISIS WITHIN NOT JUST THE STATE BUT AROUND THE WORLD. AND THE THOUGHT OF REMOVING A RESOURCES TO THINGS LIKE STATE LABS IS JUST ON ACCEPTABLE. WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS WITH OUR LABS WITH OUR INSPECTION TEAMS WITH OUR WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS TO REACH AND THAT WAS REQUIRES STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BUT ALSO REQUIRES RA RESOURCES. HEARING CALIFORNIAN ALONG THE WEST COAST OUR INDUSTRY RELIES ON GOOD SENSIBLE REASONABLE REGULATION PROTECTING WATER SENSITIVE HABITATS POLLUTION WASTE IS OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WE NEED THESE EFFORTS TO BE BASED IN SCIENCE. AND BASED IN OUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTS. WE NEED MORE PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT WE ARE SO THANKFUL FOR THE PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE IN MANY OF THE EXISTING AGENCIES CONSERVATION GROUPS AND NGOS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GROWING HOPEFULLY. INCLUDING THOSE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN LESS FAVORABLE TO OUR INDUSTRY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE AND TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR INDUSTRY. THREE THANK YOU SO MUCH. GO TO HEAR- INTO SECOND MISTER ROSS. BUT I WAS JUST ME WITH A GOOD FOLKS. FROM HI ISLAND OVER THE WEEKEND. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NINE MONTHS ENDED UP WHAT WE LIKE TO BE A TO DO IN JULY- PUT TOGETHER- KIND OF A CHECK IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT- WHETHER IT'S IN HUMBOLDT OR POTENTIALLY WEST MARIN. I BRING SOME REPRESENTATIVES- FROM DEPARTMENT OUT. AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT. AND HOW WE'RE GONNA IMPLEMENT- IN THAT THIS IS TO GET THIS IN MONTHS SEVEN. SO WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IN CASE WERE GOING OFF THE RAILS AS FAR AS TIMELINE. TO GET BACK ON SO WOULD LOVE TO BE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT WONDERFUL WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT IT'S GREAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN OF- MANY OF YOUR MEMBERS AS WELL SPEAKING CHIU ABLE. TO GET I WILL SAY WE CHECKED IN WITH CALLS COMMISSION A. BEEN GOOD- AT TEN THERE CAN BE A HIT. CHALLENGES ONLY HAVE ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S DOING THE WHOLE THING SO- AND MORE TO COME ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE REALITY WE DEAL WITH WITH THAT AGENCY THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED RESOURCES AND- A LOT OF IT AND UP IN ONE PERSON'S PLATE YEAH. IN HIS I KNOW HE'S HUSTLING BUT IT'S- SO MORE TO COME WE LOOK FOR THE WORK WITH YOU ALL RIGHT. I LAYS IN YOUR WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO ROB ROSS THE EXACTLY DIRECTOR THE COMPANY FISHERIES AND SEAFOOD INSTITUTE- IN HIS THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS PAC- ADVISER FOR THE CALIFORNIA AQUACULTURE ASSOCIATION. THRUST COULD SEE SIR IT SEE YOU SIR AND THANK YOU WE DON'T GET TO- SAY THANK YOU TO YOU. AND TO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TO TOM. A NOT FORGET TO SAY THANKS TO TOM QUITE A BIT BUT I HAD. EVEN MORE TO THE EFFORTS. OF ALL OF YOU. I'M THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE INDUSTRY- AND WHAT YOU DO TO PROTECT. AND ENHANCE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY. I HAVE TO TOP THINGS TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. ONE IS THIS COMMITTEE INITIATED THE DISASTER RELIEF THAT UNFORTUNATELY WAS NEEDED FOR THE CRAB INDUSTRY THE SALMON INDUSTRY. THE STARTING INDUSTRY THE URCHIN IN DISARRAY AND- PERHAPS EVEN IN THE FUTURE THE SQUID INDUSTRY. BUT WE HAVE ALL BENEFITED FROM YOUR DOG DETERMINATION AND FOR THE AID RECEIVED AND THE PENDING- AID THAT IS STILL- EXPECTED- RANDY FISHER FROM THE PACIFIC STAYS RAIN FISHERIES COMMISSION LEFT FOR WASHINGTON ON SUNDAY HE'S BEEN LOBBYING WITH THE TEAM TO GET OMB AND COMMERCE. TO BUST LOOSE SOME OF THE FUNDS THAT SEEM TO GET LOST IT'S IMPORTANT TO US I KNOW IT'S- PENCIL SHAVING DOES TOO- OMB INTO COMMERCE BUT IT'S GOING TO BE. VERY IMPORTANT TO THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE IN THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ON BEHALF OF A GRATEFUL INDUSTRY FOR- YOUR AUTHORSHIP OF TWO SIXTY TWO LAST YEAR AN ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT THIS YEAR THAT IF ENACTED WILL PROVIDE A VERY IMPORTANT OPTION TO PEOPLE IN THE CRAB INDUSTRY IT'LL ALLOW AN OPTION OF YOU THIS RATING CRAB AS YOU KNOW THE TWENTY PART PER MILLION DEMOC ACID LEVELS THAT TRIGGER WHETHER OR NOT CRAB FISHING CAN GO ON. THOSE LEVELS ARE NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CUTS. THE VISCERA OF THE CRAB. BUT IF WE CAN REMOVE THAT. AS IS DONE NOW AS AN INDUSTRY% PRACTICE QUICKLY BODY MEET AND THE LET ME. WE DO AWAY WITH THE PROBLEM OF DEMO CASTED BEING IN THAT CRAB MEAT. AND I'LL CONCLUDE THE SAYING WE NEED MORE SEAFOOD WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES AND WE WILL. NEED TO AUGMENT THESE RESOURCES GOING FORWARD. FOOD SECURITY IS NATIONAL. SECURITY IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. AND WE CAN AFFORD TO DENY THIS. IN THE THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW GLOBAL DEMAND FOR SEAFOOD WILL INCREASE BY SEVENTY PERCENT. THAT'LL BE THREE BILLION MORE PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. WE MUST DO OUR PART BY INCREASING ACCESS TO- FISHING AND FISHING AT MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE. YIELD LEVELS WE MUST ALSO AUGMENT. WHERE WE CAN THE SEAFOOD. TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR CITIZENS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS MUCH AT MR RUSS'S VERY GRATEFUL AND I THINK. I THINK YOU'LL AGREE I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS A NUMBER ONE- BEING ABLE TO FARM OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST- AND THE NUMBER TWO HAVING A CERTAINTY WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATION RIGHT- TIMELINE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO BE A TO GET PERMITTED- AND- CAN REALLY WHAT I'VE HEARD A LOT FROM. YOUR CLIENTS IS GIVE US A BOX RIGHT WE NEED TO LIVE IN. AND TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO BE TO DO TO GET THERE I AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE- OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST SPREADABLE BUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH IN A LIGHT AT- COMMENT ON THAT WILL TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR. IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL. PLEASE ZERO TO THE VICE CHAIR OF. WELL DID NOT VISIBLE THEY'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY A QUESTION BUT THIS SOON TALK ABOUT THE OYSTER INDUSTRY. AND THIS NOTION OF ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND BRING SCIENCE TO BEAR. LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PLACES THE EEL GRASS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL THEY ARE. SO REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT HAVE EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME HAD WANTED TO SEPARATE THOSE BUT RE THINKING THAT THAT THAT'S- YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE BRING SCIENCE. INTO THE REGULATORY CONTACTS ENSURING THAT HOW WE'RE DOING PERMITTING AND BEING WILLING TO LEARN AS WE MOVE ALONG IS BENEFICIAL TO THE INDUSTRIES AND THAT'S ALSO COME THROUGH PART. BY WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE AGENCIES IN ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION AS WE NEEDED AS WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS IS ULTIMATELY VERY IMPORTANT. MR SO MISTER VICE CHAIR OF THE NAY. THAT COULD BE PART OF AQUACULTURE RIGHT ENHANCING EELGRASS BY GROWING HILL GRASS AND PUTTING IT WHERE WE WANT TO HAVE A BENEFICIAL USE MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE RESPONSE WITH REGARD TO- THE BOX IF YOU MENTION. ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN A NEW WAY OF AQUACULTURE TO AUGMENT EXISTING COMMERCIAL FISHING SUPPLIES OF FISH. WHAT IN ESSENCE BE A NEW FISHERY BUT IT ALSO HAS A PROCESS WE HAVE A SEQUEL PROCESS WE HAVE A NEPA PROCESS AND CONCERNS AND IDEAS AND- AND COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO IMPROVE THAT. IS PART OF A PROCESS AND WE LOOK FORWARDTO DOING THAT JUST LIKE WE LOOK FORWARD TO AFTER SEVENTEEN YEARS HAVING A- PROMISED PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THERE WE GO. YEAH AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY THAT IS NOT AGAINST REGULATION WE DEPEND ON GOOD SENSIBLE SCIENTIFICALLY BASED REGULATION TO PROTECT OUR INDUSTRIES AS WELL. AND SO. MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON THAT SCIENCE IS IMPERATIVE AND IT CAN'T BE SCIENCE THAT IS- PROHIBITIVE OF GROWTH.YOUR SPOT ON. AND TELL US WHAT YOU WHAT I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HIS. TELL US WHAT YOU NEED IT WILL MEET YOU THERE RIGHT BUT WE NEED THAT CONSISTENCY AND WE WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE WE WANT TO BE PARTNERS WE KNOW OUR FIELD WE'VE MANY OF US HAVE BEEN DOING THIS LIKE I SAID FOR MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. WE KNOW THE ESTUARIES AND THE WATER BODIES THAT WE WORK AND IT'S IN OUR INTEREST TO PROTECT THOSE AND SO TO BE LOOKED AT AS NOT A PARTNER IN THAT RELATIONSHIP IS- VERY DISAPPOINTING. AND DISHEARTENING. VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE TREK. DOWN SOUTH THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR- AND VERY GRATEFUL. HEY IT WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON JULY IS WELL IF THAT WORKS FOR YOU ALL. I THANK YOU SO MUCH SAFE TRAVELS ON. IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING BACK TO- OUR NEXT PANEL IT THAT'S PANEL THAT'S ITEM NUMBER FIVE AN URGENT AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT FISHERIES AN OFFSHORE WIND. ENERGY AT THIS IS IN UPDATE THAT WE LIKE TO BE A PROVIDE FOLKS- LOOK. WE HAD A WHOLE HEARING UP IN. YOU RE GOT- ABOUT. AND WHAT WAS IT TOM YEAR AGO. LAST MAKE COMING UP ON A YEAR- AND WE WANT TO BE A TO GET AN UPDATE ON ALL. ISSUES RELATED. TO WIN- IN FULL DISCLOSURE WE'RE GONNA BE PUTTING TOGETHER. A WORKING GROUP- WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM- THE OFF SHORE WHEN INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION REMAIN BODY IN THE C. E. C. TO BE PARTICIPATE- AND SOME ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. JUST TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT IS NEEDED TO BE- TO MOVE FORWARD ON OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY AND SPECIALLY FOCUSED ON THE STUDIES SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT. PANELIST FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WANNA IS A WELCOME TO COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS A KAREN DOUGLAS IS COMMISSIONER THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. SHE'S REALLY BEEN THE POINT THAT FOR THE COMMISSION ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. SHE'S GOING TO GIVE SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE STATE'S APPROACH RAUSCHER WIND. AND PERSPECTIVESIN OPPORTUNITIES AND POTENTIALLY OBSTACLES UP FOR OFFSHORE WIND HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE THEN I DANIEL MILLS IS HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ATTENDING. DIRECTOR THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION SHE'S ME PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON- THE INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE ON HOW A SURE WIN PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING. BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AS WELL AS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO- THE GOLDEN STATE SHE'S ALSO GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON FROM THE INDUSTRY'S PERSPECTIVE. ABOUT STATEWIDE PLANNING IN OUT WHY THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL. AND THEN WHAT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT MIKE CONROY IS HERE HE'S A PRESENT IN THE WEST COAST FISHERIES- OF WEST COAST FISHERIES CONSULTANTS. HE IS GONNA BE FOCUSING ON OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FISHERIES. FISHERMEN IN FISHING COMMUNITIES AND HOW TO BE A TO AVOID IT. MITIGATED AND MINIMIZE AT IMPACT AND THAT'S AT A HUGE PRIORITY. FOR THIS COMMITTEE AS AT AT FISHING COMMUNITIES HAVE ENOUGH ON THE PLATE- IN HAVING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES IS THE LAST THING WE NEED ALL RIGHT. SO WITHOUT FURTHER DO YOU THINK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE IT WAS SO GOOD TO BE TO SEE THE COMMISSIONER AT AT THE DINNER INDEED YOU HAVE THE VOICE. I DID HAVE THE OYSTER THEY'RE DELICIOUS ALL RIGHT HEY IDEA. I THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MEDICALLY SURE WE LOVE SENIOR HERE AT IN COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND WE'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHAIRMAN WEIR VICE CHAIR STONE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATE ON ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD OFFSHORE WIND IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WAS ASKED TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS OPPORTUNITIES CHALLENGES AND STATUS OF WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND SO I WILL DO THAT- IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES OFFSHORE WIND HAS BECOME A MATURE INDUSTRY ACROSS THE WORLD IT IT'S A- VERY EFFECTIVE- RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY VERY COST EFFECTIVE IT'S BEEN DEPLOYED AT SCALE. IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE- INCREASINGLY IN ASIA AS WELL. AND WHILE. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE WOULD NEED IN CALIFORNIA OF FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND IS LESS DEVELOPED IT'S COMING ALONG AND I THINK IN TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF- AND THE RESOURCE WE HAVE OFF OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST. OFFSHORE WIND COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING THE STATE. MEET ITS RENEWABLE ENERGY AND CLIMATE GOALS. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE OFF OF THE CENTRAL COAST IN AN EVEN BETTER RESOURCE OFF OF THE NORTH COAST IN TERMS OF THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL AND CAPACITY FACTORS- OFFSHORE WIND IS REASONABLY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE SOLAR GENERATION PROFILE SO. WHAT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT- WHILE SOLAR GENERATION PEAKS IN THE MIDDLE THE DAY OFFSHORE WIND CAN ACTUALLY HELP US WITH OUR EVENING RAMP WHEN WE ARE OTHERWISE- RELYING ON- NATURAL GAS FOR THE MOST PART. OF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND- IT OFFERS US ON THE CENTRAL COAST AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE USE OF EXISTINGOF TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. ARE THERE ARE ALSO MANY CHALLENGES WITH REGARD OFFSHORE WIND OF THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE SO ON THE CENTRAL COAST WE COULD PROBABLY ACCOMMODATE. TWO TO THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND GENERATION IN EXISTING. INFRASTRUCTURE AT MORRO BAY IN DIABLO CANYON AND THAT'S A HUGE POTENTIAL BENEFIT. TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TO OUR SYSTEM- BEYOND THAT HOWEVER WHEN WE LOOK UP AT THE NORTH COAST- IT WOULD TAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO EXPORT OFFSHORE WIND FROM THERE- AND REALLY IT BECOMES. NOT ONLY A QUESTION OF COST BUT IT SOME DEGREE A QUESTION OF FEASIBILITY I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MUCH BETTER AND WE'RE TAKING SOME STEPS TO DO THAT. THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT IS COMPLEX. ECOSYSTEMS ARE COMPLEX AND ALREADY IMPACTED AND YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION. ON THAT TODAY- WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT WITH PROACTIVE DATA COLLECTION SPATIAL PLANNING RESEARCH AND OUTREACH- THE COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY IS THE INDUSTRY MOST DIRECTLY IMPACTED. BY A OFFER WHEN DEVELOPMENT AND- FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN LOOKING AT EXPERIENCES IN OTHER COUNTRIES THERE THERE HAVE BEEN- CREATIVE AN IMPORTANT. EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH THE FISHING COMMUNITY TO THINK ABOUT MEDICATION TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DO. ABOUT THAT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. CERTAIN KINDS OF FISHING PARTICULARLY TRAWLING JUST REALLY. IS FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM FISHERMEN THEMSELVES LIKE THAT THERE'D BEEN A WANT TO pRISK THEIR EQUIPMENT DOING THAT AROUND OFFSHORE WIND FACILITIES AND SO- THERE'S A REAL- CHALLENGE THERE. AND FOR THAT REASON. OBVIOUSLY IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TO HAVE HERE THE FISHING INDUSTRY HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE AND PART OF THE PROCESS AS WE LOOK AT WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE'RE DON'T WE GO AND HOW MUCH POTENTIAL IS THERE AND HOW DO WE GET THIS DONE- TECHNOLOGY AND QUSAI I'VE MENTIONED BRIEFLY THE LAST. ISSUE A MENTION VISUAL IMPACTS CALIFORNIA COASTLINE IS. IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. IN THE PROCESS WITH THE BUREAU OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT WHERE OFFSHORE WIND SHOULD GO- THE STATE WAS PRETTY ASSERTIVE ABOUT SAYING OFFER WHEN SHOULD BE FURTHER FROM SHORT TWENTY MILES OR MORE FURTHER FROM SHORE AND- THE FEDERAL AGENCY WENT ALONG WITH THAT. IN ITS INITIAL ITERATION OF CALL AREAS OR OR AREAS WHERE- LEASING COULD OCCUR YOU THE ONE. AGO WHEN THEY'RE PERFECT. ALL RIGHT SO. BUT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT HAPPENING- WE HAD OUR THIRD TASK FORCE MEETING ON TUESDAY- THE FOCUS OF THAT MEETING WAS TO LOOK AT SOME ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE AREAS THAT A GROUP OF AGENCIES FEDERAL AND STATE CAME UP WITH. TO PROBLEM SOLVE ON THE CENTRAL COAST BECAUSE THE CALL AREAS THAT WE HAD INITIALLY COME UP WITH. WERE DEEMED INCOMPATIBLE FOR MILITARY ACTIVITIES- SOME OF THOSE AREAS GO CLOSER TO THE THOSE AREAS IN GENERAL GO CLOSER SURE WE WOULD HAVE A MAP WITH THE SEVENTEEN MILE LINE AND A FIFTEEN MILE LINE. THERE ARE VISUAL SIMULATIONS BEING PREPARED THIS PUBLIC OUT REACHES IT WERE WERE AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF INFORMAL OUT REACH ON THAT AND I THINK I THINK OF. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST THE ENERGY COMMISSION WE HAVE A STRONG GROUP OF STATE AGENCIES WORKING TOGETHER THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAVE REALLY PARTNERED. ON THIS AND- THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS FUNDING A NUMBER OF REALLY IMPORTANT. STUDIES THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE. AND I'LL TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM I I'M SURE AS WE GET INTO Q. NA BUT THE ONE THAT ALL ALL MENTIONED RIGHT NOW. IS THAT THE- PC IS CURRENTLY FINALISING A GRANT TO THE HUMBLE FISHERMAN'S MARKETING ASSOCIATION FOR MAPPING EXERCISE THAT WOULD DIRECTLY INVOLVE US FISHERMEN FROM DAHLE NORT HUMBLED MENDOCINO COUNTIES AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING AT SPECIES SPECIES COMPLEX YOUR TYPE FISHING AREA BY DEATH FOR THE- SEA FLOOR SUBSTRATE. IN SEASON AND MORE IN ORDER TO BRING FISHERMEN CAN ENTER AND THEIR INPUT DIRECTLY INTO SOME OF OUR GEO SPATIAL PLANNING AND SO THAT'S ONE THING I WANT TO MENTION NO THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMISSIONER REALLY GRATEFUL WILL COME BACK IN JUST A BIT- IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WE'RE IN TURN OVER MISS MILLS AFTER AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION. BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE IS BILLS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES A NO GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT THE FLOORS YOURS MA'AM THANK YOU FOR BEING COMMITTEE TODAY COURSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR FOR THE IMITATION AND THANK YOU TOM FOR SETTING THIS ALL UP- I'VE JUST BEEN VERY STRUCK BY THE- ENGAGEMENT. AND REFERENCE. NOW PROCESS. THAT I'VE HEARD TODAY AND- THE NEED TO GET EVERYONE WORKING TOGETHER NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE GOOD SUSTENANCE. FOR CALIFORNIANS AND BEYOND- BUT I'M HERE. IN THE NAME OF. PROVIDING CLEAN RELIABLE ENERGY FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S- PROBABLY INHERENTLY SOME TENSION THERE SINCE WE'RE BOTH LOOKING AT THE SAME AREAS FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT BUT- I'M REALLY HERE OUT OF RESPECT IN. WANTING TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FISHING INDUSTRY AND WITH ALL OF YOU ON THIS. SO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN% WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION- AND NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE U. S. WIND INDUSTRY ARE PROTESTING PARTICIPATING COMPANIES- DEVELOP SOLAR STORAGE. TRANSMISSION OFFSHORE WINDS- AND DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AS WELL SO WE IT TAKE A SORT OF ALL OF THE ABRUPT ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH TO RENEWABLE ENERGY- AFTER WIND IS VERY CLEARLY ON THE HORIZON IN CALIFORNIA AND IT PRESENTS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO ADVANCE ITS POSITION. AS A CLEAN ENERGY LEADER WHILE REALIZING ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCEBENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLEAN ECONOMY JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF POTENTIAL CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE GIGAWATTS WORTH OF TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR OFFSHORE WIND ALONG ITS COAST- THAT THOSE AREAS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY SORT OF WINNOW DOWN TO LOOK AT COMMERCIAL VIABILITY AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AND- IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STUDIES- UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER. WHEN OF THAT DOWN TO TWENTY ONE GIGAWATTS OF TOTAL POTENTIAL IN A STUDY OF FIVE SITES ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST. FOR REFERENCE TWENTY ONE GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WOULD BE ABOUT 11% OF THE STATE'S TWENTY FORTY FIVE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEMAND- ANOTHER STUDY THE CALIFORNIA AFTER NGUYEN PROJECT BY THE AMERICAN JOBS PROJECT IDENTIFIED- THAT EIGHTEEN GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND. COULD SUPPORT. SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED JOBS IN DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRIES. THANK MANY TRAINING CONSTRUCTION% OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AND THEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT ISSUED A CALL FOR NOMINATIONS AND INTEREST- FOR THREE OFFSHORE WIND CALL AREAS ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST. ONE THE AREAS THAT COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS REFERENCED AS WELL- AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARD FINDING A WAY TO CREATE ABOUT EIGHT GIGAWATTS OF POTENTIAL FROM THOSE THREE CALL AREAS FOR THE OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY. THE COMPANIES THAT RESPONDED TO THAT- CALL INCLUDED FOURTEEN GLOBAL DEVELOPERS OF FLOATING AFTER NGUYEN TECHNOLOGY MANY OF WHOM ALSO DO OTHER TYPES OF ENERGY EXPLORATION SO THE INTEREST IS REAL AND INVESTMENT DOLLARS ARE ALREADY COMING TO CALIFORNIA- IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT I'M SURE WHEN CAN COMPLEMENT CALIFORNIA'S GENERATION AND LOAD PROFILE. THAT WAS MENTIONED THIS AS WELL. BUT IT I IN IN A STUDY BY THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY LOOKING AT SIX DIFFERENT SITES ON CALIFORNIA'S COAST IT FOUND THAT ALL SIX OF THOSE REFERENCE SITES HAD HIGHEST WIND SPEEDS BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN PM. IN THE EVENING. HAS BEEN MOST FUNDING FOR THE STATE AS WE TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY- I GET CARBON OFFER SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN WE TEND TO RUN OUR FUTURE PLANS- AND THEN VARIOUS THESE OF ALSO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF OFFSHORE WIND AS WELL- DENTAL REPAIR. FITS OF ONE TO TWO. ONCE THE INDUSTRY COMES SCALE AND IDENTIFYING WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES IN BEING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN MANUFACTURING CONSTRUCTION. CONSTRUCTION OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE- BUT OF COURSE THIS HEARING IS A COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SO ON EDGE- SHIP WITH THE- MINISTRY. AM I COLLEAGUES ON THE EAST COAST AVE WORKED WITH A FIFTEEN COMMUNITY COMMERCIAL RECREATION. I THINK IT PRODUCT. I CAN'T SAY. THESE HAVE BEEN FOR TO WORK TOWARD RESOLUTION A NUMBER OF PROJECT DEVELOPERS ALSO HAVE BEGUN TO REACH OUT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FISHING COMPANIES IN THE STATE- AS TEY'RE INTERESTED IN SPECIFIC AREAS FOR THEIR OWN PROJECT SOME ARE JUST SORT OF WATCHING THE MARKET TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE BILL I'M LEASE SALES BEFORE REALLY HAPPEN SING ONE PARTICULAR AREA OR WHAT COMMUNITY. AND THEN YOU KNOW THE BUREAU. MY PROCESS AS- I HAVE TO BALANCE THE CIVIC FACTORS AND FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT FOR RESOLVING SOME OF THESE CONFLICTS- BUT INDUSTRY IS ALSO WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOMB PROCESS TO ENGAGE WITH STINK AND IS AND THEN WE'RE PROPOSING A STATEWIDE PLANNING PROCESS TO HELP BUILD THE INDUSTRY TO SCALE TO REALIZE THE MANY BENEFITS THAT OPTION WE CAN PROVIDE AND I CAN. OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE BANQUET ENCOMPASS WOULD BE STAKEHOLDER REACH TO AVOID MINIMIZE AND MITIGATE CONFLICT AS THE OPTION WHEN IT WIND ST GROUP WAS I WE WANT TO CREATE A FORM THEIR FEEDBACK THE FISHING COMMUNITY ANTI BY DATA OR RISK. FOR WHEN AMPLE OF. THAT WERE CONTEMPT. PLAN BE A AN ANALYSIS OF PORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW PORTS COULD BE. ARE POTENTIALLY RETROFITTED TO HELP SUSTAIN AN OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S ALSO CONCERN AMONG- THE FISHING COMMUNITY THAT. THAT COULD OVERBURDEN THE FACILITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY THERE FOR THE FISHING. INDUSTRY SO WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND FINDING WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S CO EXISTENCE AND COMPATIBILITY IN AND- OUT AS THE INDUSTRY MOVES FORWARD. OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN WOULD BE STAKEHOLDER I'D AS STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON SITE IDENTIFICATION. ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AND PERMITTING. TRANSMISSION AND PROCUREMENT PLANNING. AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN BUILD THIS INDUSTRY TO SCALE TO GET THE WORK FORCE AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT WEEK- BELIEVE ARE POSSIBLE SO I'M SURE NGUYEN PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO REALIZE TRIPLE BOTTOM LINE GAINS FOR THE ECONOMY ENVIRONMENT AND WORK FORCE- AND REALLY TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE MANY SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO CALIFORNIA'S FISHERY WHICH IS CLIMATE CHANGE. ARE WE HOPE WORK TO ENHANCE FISHING RENO OPPORTUNITIES YES COAST THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH BUSINESS AND HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- IN JUST A BIT OF WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER AT NOW OF COURSE IT TO MR CONROY AT PRESENT AT THE WEST COAST FISHERIES CONSULTANTS THE FOR ARE THREE OR FIVE MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SIR VICE CHAIR. AND TOM. THANKS WITHIN A TWO INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT MY NAME IS MIKE CONROY I'M THE PRESIDENT WAS BECAUSE FISHERIES SOLVENTS. WE PROVIDE RIDE SERVICE COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL. CHARTER BOAT FISHERMEN DIRECTLY OR- HER WERE INVOLVED JUST ABOUT EVERY FISHERY WHICH TAKE PLACE UP THE CALIFORNIA COAST AND ON THE HIGH SEAS. I CURRENTLY SAID ON THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES VISOR PROPEL. SERVED ON MANY THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION'S WORK GROUP. I THINK IN ORDER TO GET YOU HAVE A GOOD IDEA UP. WHAT WE'RE- UP FOR SOME REASON LET SLIDE. SHE IS A SORRY ABOUT THIS. FOR SOME REASON RUN. MY. TRY THE CLICKER BY THE CLICKER. NEED TO CLEAN MY. SORRY I'M I'M TECHNOLOGICALLY NOT INTELLIGENT. THERE. YEAH OKAY. IT'S OKAY IT'S IT IT'S IT WE WAS DO WITHOUT THE CARPORT THAT'S FINE WE ALSO PUT IN THE WORK IN DRIVE YOU CRAZY BECAUSE IT WOULD DRIVE ME CRAZY THE DAM POWER POINTS I APOLOGIZE IT'S OKAY WHO I KNOW THAT TOM PUT THIS UP ON THE WEBSITE SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG IT'S NOT GONNA BE IMPERATIVE YEAH BEFORE THE CLOSE OF ALL THAT SO. BEFORE I MADE IT THE NEXT SLIDE WOULD'VE BEEN REALLY NEED IT WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT IT HIGHLIGHTED THAT. FIND THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A DEFINITE DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE'RE- APPROACHING OFFSHORE WIND SENSE. THE PRE AND POST. SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. MOST FISHING INTERESTS WERE CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN THE LEASE APPLICATION TO BOMB IN EARLY TWENTY SIXTEEN APPEARED FOR AREAS OFTEN FEDERAL WATERS OF SIDE MORE OBEY. WHILE THE APPLICANT DID ENGAGE LOCAL FISHERMEN OTHERS WITH WITH HISTORIC DEPENDENCE ON THE AREAS THAT WERE NOT ENGAGED FOR EXAMPLE PARTICIPANTS IN THE ALBACORE FISHERY. SIMILARLY IMPORTANT STATE FISHERIES WHICH WOULD BE IMPACTED HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED SQUID FOR INSTANCE. WE LEARNED OF THE HUMBLE CALL AREA IN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND EXPERIENCED A SIMILAR WIDESPREAD LACK OF ENGAGEMENT. POST TWENTY SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN THIS IS NOT JUST A CALIFORNIA ISSUE. LAST SEPTEMBER BOM OREGON TASK FORCE MEETING MADE IT CLEAR FISHERMEN HAVE NOT FISHMAN DEPENDENT ON THE GROUNDS OF OREGON HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS. IN ORDER TO BENEFIT FROM THE RESPONSIBLE OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT ALLIANCES EXPERIENCES ON THE EAST COAST WEST COAST FISHERMEN ANOTHER ISSUE GROUPS HAVE JOINED ON TO RHODA. WE ASK ROTOR TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE DEDICATED TO WEST COAST ISSUES AND THEY HAVE DONE SO. LAST MAY ROAD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ANY HAWKINS CAME AND SPOKE TO DURING HEARING IN EUREKA. ROAD IS AIMS TO COORDINATE SCIENCE AND POLICY INITIATIVES TO MINIMIZE CONFLICTS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL AND HISTORICAL FISHING IN OTHER PROPOSED USES ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF. THANKS TO TOM FOR INCLUDING MATERIALS REGARDING ROAD ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE FOR THIS MEETING AS WELL. TO DATE ROAD A PACIFIC HAS MEMBERS RANGING FROM SAN DIEGO ALL THE WAY TO ALASKA. WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM MOST TO NOT ALL FISHERIES THAT OPERATE WITHIN THAT AREA. QUESTION THAT WAS OUT THERE IS THAT I'M HERE TO ADDRESS CAN FISHERIES AN OFFSHORE RENEWABLES CO EXIST. SOME STATUTES WILL REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES WE KNOW THIS WILD WE WOULD PREFER A LAND BASED RENEWABLES THAT ALONE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. WE CANNOT SUPPORT OR DECISIONS MADE WITHOUT OUR INPUTS THAT WILL HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS ON OUR LIVELIHOODS AND THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A HEALTHY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE SOURCE OF PROTEIN TO CALIFORNIANS AND TO OUR NATION. HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND WEEKS OUR NATIONAL FOOD SECURITY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR MUST BE CONSIDERED. TO THE EXTENT THAT WHEN BASS OPTIONS PREVENT SUFFICIENT. OPTION AREAS WHICH WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON FISHERIES WOULD BE PREFERRED. IN ORDER TO HELP GET TO THE POINT WERE WE GET FROM. TO GETTING FISHERMEN SUPPORT FOR OFFSHORE NOBLES WE DO HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS AND SOME HIGHLY AND I LIGHT SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. INCLUSION AND TRANSPARENCY. IF YOU ARE AT THE TABLE YOUR ON THE MENU. THE RAPID PACE OF OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT IN FAVOR TO ENGAGE ALL FISHING INTERESTING COMMUNITIES. A RESULTING IN DISHES SINCE WAS SERIOUS IMPASSE OR SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES IMPACTS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN MINIMIZED HAVE EVEN ENGAGE EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND PARTICIPATED IN CITING pCONVERSATIONS. TRUST AND PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES GETTING INFORMATION FROM BOWMAN IMITATIONS TO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OFFSHORE WIND DURING MONDAY'S BOMB CALIFORNIA WEAPON ARE WE LEARNED OF A WORKING GROUP THAT WAS FORMED BY CONGRESSMAN CARVAJAL THIS WORKING GROUP INCLUDES REPRESENTED SOME CONGRESS AND PUT THAT IS OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEAR OF A MANAGE MANAGEMENT. NO WAS THREE OFFICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO FISHING INTERESTS WERE INCLUDED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY AT LEAST FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE NATIONALLY FISHERIES SERVICE IS NOT INCLUDED SOUTH WAS FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTERS ON INCLUDED PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL ARE NOT INCLUDED. NEXT THING TO LOOK OUT BIG COMMUNICATION HONESTY WE CONTINUE TO NOTE THE LACK OF INCORRECT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFER. DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN THE FACT THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ON FISHERIES AND CONDITION OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING PROTECTED SPECIES AND OTHER SPECIES OF CONCERN. TO BE CLEAR IN MANY WAYS OFFICER WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABLE COMMERCIAL FISHING ARE DIRECTLY CONFLICTING ACTIVITIES. COMMUNITY WHERE IT'S NOT REACHING NEEDS TO BE APPROVED AN UNDERSTANDING. OUT REACHED A FISHING INTERESTS OUTSIDE OF CITING REAS IS BEEN NONEXISTENT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PERMITTED COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND COME CHARTER BOAT VESSEL OPERATORS ARE UNAWARE OF THE DETAILS OF THE GUARD OFFER WENT OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WE MUST AND STRIVE TO DO BETTER. THERE ARE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THE SOUTH LE'S JUST FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER LONG RUNNING SERVICE WHICH CONDUCTED IN THIS CALL AREAS HE'S CALL THESE SURVEYS AND FOR STOCK ASSISTANCE FOR COMMERCIALLY AND RECREATIONALLY IMPORTANT STOCKS AND FISHERIES IMPACT OF THESE SURVEYS MUST BE ELIMINATED. WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE AGENCIES IN THE SERVICE CENTER ABOUT THIS OR ANY OTHER MATTERS. WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE AND MAXIMIZE BUT FOR WHEN. THE FISHING INDUSTRY HAS AND WILL BE THE PRIMARY LOSER IN THIS PROCESS. DIRECT LOSSES OF ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES AND REVENUES. INDIRECT LOSSES AS WELL WATERFRONT SPACE AND PORTS AND HARBORS. IMPACTS OF ELECTRIC CABLES ON FISH OF ATTACKS AND MIGRATION CORRIDORS. NAVIGATIONAL THAT DANGERS OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPERS HAVE NOTICED ARGUES OF THESE WATERS WILL SURELY BE THOUGHT OF AS THE WINNERS. ABOUT ONE IN. PROMOTING WIN WIN SCENARIOS WOULD SEEM TO REQUIRE PARADIGM SHIFT READ. REGARDING HOW FISHERY INTERESTS ARE TREATED. WITH REGARD TO MITIGATION MEMBERS WE ARE ONLY LIMITED BY THE BY THE- AMOUNT OF OUR CREATIVITY. SO OUR APPS SPECIFICALLY BE WOULD BE. TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN INFLUENCE BOWMAN AND THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. SURFICIAL BECAUSE- THE ARE THE CAL. COMMISSION FORCE. THIS IS OUR BIGGEST PROP DE AND THE BEST DIFFICULT FOR AVAILABLE WE'VE HEARD REPEATED THROUGHOUT TODAY THAT DATA AND SCIENCE MATTER. USE OURS IN THIS AS WELL SECOND BE ENSURE A FULLY TRANSPARENT AND INCLUSIVE PROCESS IS REQUIRED FOR ANY PROJECTS PROPONENT IN STATE WATERS. WE NOTE THAT STATE LANDS COMMISSION LAST SEPTEMBER. WAS DANGLING ITS TOLL IN THE OFFSHORE WIND WORLD BY PROPOSING A- THE WIND FARM. OFF OF HALAMA WHICH IS BETWEEN THAT ARE WELL AND POINT CONCEPTION IT WAS QUICKLY WITHDRAWN WHEN I THINK JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS CAUGHT OFF GUARD NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS UNTIL THE- MEETING SO AND IF YOU CAN DO TO FOSTER COMMUNICATIONS AWARENESS BE GREATLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR LOOK I I'M- THANK BOTTOM LINE FOR US IN A FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO. THE COMMISSIONER BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS SINCE LAST YEAR AND HAVE BEEN IN THE OFFICE MANY TIMES TWENTY. A MOMENT SAY THANK YOU- AS WELL AS- INDUSTRY OF COMING IN AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS THANKS. BOTTOM LINE PRICES THAT WE NEEDED DO EXACTLY AGES OUT LIKE EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM. AND TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO OR STATEWIDE APPROACH. MY CONCERN I BELIEVE- I CAN SPEAK FOR THE COMMISSION ON THIS IS. RATHER GOING PORT BY PORT. AND DOING THESE ONE OFTEN AGREEMENTS WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT. WHAT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT. A CRISIS. RIGHT AND THAT MEANS WE GET TO BRING FORWARD ONE INITIAL THE- EVEN I AM A BILL AND LIKE IF YOU FOR ANYONE ELSE ON WHOSE HERE AT. AND PANEL I'M A BOY THIS THE ONLY VIABLE OPTION RIGHT NOW IS GONNA BE THE NORTH COAST- WE ARTICLE A STATEWIDE APPROACH BECAUSE- I DON'T WANT ONE FORGETTING SOMETHING ANOTHER PORT NOT- AND IF FOR CPS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. ON MAKING THIS A BIBLE RENEWABLE RESOURCE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A STATEWIDE POLICY. SO YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT IN FACT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO BRING FOR HIS INFORMAL WORKING GROUP WITH THE COMMISSIONER WITH INDUSTRY- AND- HAVING A- CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. INDIAN WHERE I'D LIKE TO END UP IS. HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE NEED. TO DO IS STATEWIDE STUDY. THAT COULD THE NEW BECOME JUST BEING VERY CANDID ABOUT YOUR REQUEST THAT INCORPORATES FISHERIES. INTO THE STUDY RIGHT SO THAT'S WERE WOULD LIKE TO BE A GO I'VE TALKED TOO MUCH ON THIS ONE I'LL TURN OF THE COMMISSION TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD IN- MISS MILLS AND OF COURSE MR CONROY. BUT COMMISSION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I- IT I HAVE A FEW THINGS I'D LIKE TO ADD I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT IT I FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE OUT REACH ENGAGEMENT OF THE FISHING COMMUNITY IS CRITICAL- I DO WANT TO SAY THAT. IN THE TIME LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALL AREAS. THE STATE YOU KNOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF CALL AREAS LEASING IN FEDERAL WATERS THAT'S A FEDERAL PROCESS THE STATE. MADE A DECISION TO ENGAGE VERY PROACTIVELY WITH PALM AND LEVERAGE THEIR PUBLIC PROCESS AND SO. AT OUR REQUEST BONE DID A LOT OF ADDITIONAL OUT REACH BEYOND TO THEIR USUAL TASK FORCE PROCESS AYE AYE INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE THAT THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED ARE OUT OF REACH SUMMARY SO. WE DID EIGHTEEN MEETINGS AND BRIEFINGS WITH FISHERMEN AND IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN PERIOD THAT THAT SAID. IT'S REALLY NOT EASY AND THE FACT THAT WE GO OUT AND WE DO A MEETING AT YOU KNOW. PORT ST LOUIS ST LOUIS HARBOR DISTRICT OR OR SANTA BARBARA OR KIND OF PORT BY PORT WENT TO CRESCENT CITY YOU KNOW PARTICIPATED MYSELF IN A MEETING AND- BULL WITH A- FISHERMAN. IT WAS STANDING ROOM ALL. IT WAS GREAT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LET'S NOT THE COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE APPROACH WHERE WE REALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND TIME TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND IT CAN BE HIT AND MISS BECAUSE WE CAN SHOW UP AND HALF THE PEOPLE WE WANT TO TALK TO ARE OUT ON THE BOATS AND SO IT'S CHALLENGING IT IT'S HARD AND WE'RE COMMITTED. TO DOING YOU KNOW THE BEST WE CAN AND BEING CREATIVE ABOUT IT AND CONTINUING TO DO BETTER- I WANTED TO JUST BRIEFLY. SAY I AM AND YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY COMMITTED TO BEST DATA AND SCIENCE ANOTHER PROJECT TO THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL IS HELPING FUND ON. IS IN THIS CASE NOT SPECIFICALLY- FISHING BUT THERE'S FISHING INVOLVED WE ASKED THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT TO CREATE A DATA PORTAL WHERE. ALL THE DATA THAT WE WILL RELY ON WILL EXIST IN WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. AND SO THAT PORTAL EXISTED SCOTT OVER SIX HUNDRED DATA SETS ON IT- PCS HELP FUND SOME SCIENTISTS TO REALLY GO THROUGH IN A PUBLIC WAY. AND THAT IN ANALYZE THAT DATA. OF WE'RE COMMITTED TO DATA IN THE CASE OF FISHING WE THOUGHT WE NEEDED AND A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROACH AND THAT'S WHY THE OPC. WORK BOWL AND SO. I REALIZE THAT'S NOT ON THE CENTRAL COAST WERE VERY OPEN TO A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. AS WELL ON THE- POST. HEY YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE WE'VE LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO GET VERY ENGAGED IS THAT THE FEDERAL PUBLIC PROCESS THESE ARE NOT AS- AS OPEN AS WE IN CALIFORNIA ONE EXPECT AND AS WE THE STATE ONE EXPECTED THAT'S NOT THE FAULT OF THE PEOPLE OF YOUR OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT IS THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS SO FOR EXAMPLE TO BE A MEMBER OF THIS TASK FORCE YOU HAVE TO BE REPRESENTING A GOVERNMENT AGENCY. AND IN FACT THE TASK FORCE DOESN'T EVEN TAKE FORMAL PUBLIC COMMENT THEY HAVE TO ADJOURN THE MEETING AND THEN THE PUBLIC GETS TO SPEAK AND SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE TO. OPEN ACROSS THE U. WITH ON THIS COOPERATION AND SUPPORT. IS TO PROVIDE A STATE DOCKET FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED. AND TO SUBMIT THOSE COMMENTS TO BOMB ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC SO WE ARE WE REALLY WANT THIS TO BE COLLABORATIVE AND YOUR IDEA. SENATOR OF THE STATE WIDE LOOK AND- I THINK IS THE WAY TO GO I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD NO I APPRECIATE THAT COMMISSIONER IN AND LOOK AND AGAIN I GOT A- PUT PRAISE WERE BRACES DO AND IT'S ON THE COMMISSION SHE'S BEEN. ALL OVER THIS ISSUE- IN NEW MORE THAN WILLING TO BE AN INCLUDE- AND IN THE FISHING COMMUNITY I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE. IT IS. NUMBER WE GOT A- CATCH GOING ON RIGHT NOW RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE IN THE IN IN ACROSS THE WEST COAST AS WELL WE GOT A- GET RID OF THAT. AND WE GOT TO FORMALIZE THE PROCESS TO INVOLVE THE FLEET. SO ICE WHERE AGAIN I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE MEASURE BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE SAME GOAL WE DEVELOP A FORMAL PROCESS. THAT FORMAL PROCESS WOULD BE FUNDED. IT WOULD BE AN INITIAL STUDY STATEWIDE- WITH FIVE TO TEN GOALS THAT WOULD BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THAT STUDY THAT WOULD BE AN INITIAL REVIEW. AND WHO WERE GONNA OFFICIALLY ENGAGE WITH BEING VERY GENERIC RIGHT NOW BUT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO COOK THIS BUT BEFORE WE CC IT WILL BE IN A BRING- SMALL GROUP TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO GET SOME IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WERE IN LINE AT THE FLEET IN THAT ROOM AND THEN WHAT I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO. WE GOT A GOAL GET THE DOLLARS TO FUND. SO THAT'S WHEN I'M JUST VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO BE WORKING WITH THE COMMISSION ON THIS. AND STEPPING UP- MISS MILLS- QUICKLY ANY COMMENTS- IN YOU'VE BEEN SUPER ENGAGED IN JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU AS WELL. AND THEN MISTER CURRY LIVE LAST WORD SPELLS. NO I REALLY APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS'S WORK ON ALL THIS TO AN AS WELL AS YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS I THINK- THE ONE THING JUST BE CAREFUL OF AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PRESUMING CONFLICT AND IMPACTS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DO THE WORK AND DO THE SCIENCE AND GET THE DATA- BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW. I DO I WANT TO AVOID A SITUATION WHERE WE LIKE THEIR WINDOWS AND LOSERS WE- NEED TO. MAKE THIS WORK WE BOTH NEED WE NEED THIS CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY WE NEED YOU KNOW GOOD A HIGH LEVEL. YOU'LL FISHING STOCKS AND WE NEED TO FIND A PATH FORWARD SO IT'S- YOUR LEADERSHIP IN AND WHAT. COMING TO WORK NO I AGAIN- NO BE ESTAS BILLS IS BEEN EDITING TABLE AND WANTING TO BE A PARTICIPATE ON THIS AND DO THE RIGHT THING I WILL SAY- AND WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION. BEING CANDID UP THERE HAVE BEEN MISTAKES IN THE PAST. AND LET'S LEARN FROM MISTAKES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN OTHER AREAS WHETHER IT'S IN THE UNITED STATES OR- OVERSEAS. AND HOW WE CAN ENGAGE EARLY AND OFTEN. THE MORE WORK WE DO ON THE FRONT IN. WHEN I WRITE A MINISTRY IS OFF. AND I. EXPRESSED TO THINK THAT WILL SHE CAUSES CANCER WE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ON. RENEWAL ENERGY SO. THAT AIM WE NEED TO LEARN FROM. MISTAKES AND THAT SUPPOSE IN THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANY THIS VOID RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S BEST. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. BEST FOR THE FLEET. INVEST AT FOR INDUSTRIES WELL BUT AGAIN THIS BILLS EVEN DIVERSE WORK WITH MISS CONNELLY HAVE LESS WORK. THANK YOU AND ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS ITEM INCLUDED AT THE AT THE FISHERIES FORM AND I PRETTY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMISSIONERS WORDS. AND MISSILES AS WELL. YEAH I FULLY SUPPORT AN IDEA RELOOK AT. SINCE THE STATE HOLISTICALLY IN TERMS OF FISHING ACTIVITY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY CONCERNING ABOUT THE AREA OFF MORE OBEY AND OUTLOOK CANYON WAS. IT DID THEN IF. TRIED IT HAD JUST LOOKED AT THE DATA THAT CAME OUT OF THERE THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THIS THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT HAVE A CORE AREA. AND HAD THE DONE FURTHER RESEARCH THEY WOULD REALIZE THAT THE ALBACORE FISHERMEN ARE NOT ALL FROM THAT AREA NOW OFFER MORE AVAILABLE. A PAST MAJORITY OF MEN FACTOR FROM SAN GO. SO IT'S ONE THING TO GO INTO MORE OF A AND THEN TO AVALON. AND GET THE OKAY FROM THEM BECAUSE YOU KNOW. YOU'VE DONE WHATEVER YOU CAN TO GIVE THEM COMFORT. IT'S WHEN YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE STATE AS A WHOLE YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FISHERIES AS A WHOLE WHO PARTICIPATES. IN ALL THOSE AS WELL SO IT AT I'M ENCOURAGED VERY MUCH BY WHAT I'VE HEARD THUS FAR TODAY. IS CAN WE THINK YOU AT WORK IN THE PHONE UP WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE- MEDICATION- THANK YOU MISS MILLS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE IN FOR HANGING WITH US TODAY AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU. FOR TO COME. ALL RIGHT.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO PROVIDE THIS UPDATE ON BEHALF OF THE D. C. T. H. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR BEING HERE AGAIN I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE AT I TOTALLY BUT YOU DO NAY. YOU'RE VERY KIND SO THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH- IN IT MEANS A LOT AND I THINK YOU BRING WITH US I'M SORRY THAT WE GOT SUCH A LATE START AS WELL TODAY. WE'RE NOT GOING TURN OVER DAVID GOLDENBERG THE EXECUTOR AFTER THE CONFERENCE YOUR CHIN COMMISSION SIR IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING IN TODAY THE FLOOR IS YOURS FIVE MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU WOMEN A PROBLEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON. GERMAN MCGUIRE AND- VICE CHAIR STONE. AND MISTER WAS SLOW- I GIVE YOU THE MISTER THIS TIME- BEFORE I GET STARTED I WANTED TO JUST ADDRESS MRS TO US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONES- REQUEST THIS FOR THE NEW SHOOTERS. I REALLY TRY TO GET THEM TO COME LAST NIGHT BUT- I WILL EXPLAIN WHY DO WE HAVE A DEFICIT IN THE STATE AND THEN WE DO HAVE- MANY DOWN SOUTH BUT THEY HAD A LOT OF BAD WEATHER. AND OUR DRIVERS ARE NOT ALLOWED OR THEY COULDN'T- GO OUT IN GOOD FAITH- TO GET SOME MONEY BECAUSE OF BAD WEATHER. I APPRECIATE THAT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THEM THERE BUT I THINK THAT. THE AVAILABILITY OR LACK OF AVAILABILITY FOR WHATEVER REASON. WE ALWAYS NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE DON'T HAVE AND NOT TAKE ANY OF IT FOR GRANTED THAT WAS MY POINT BUT- YES UNDERSTOOD I'VE BEEN WAITING OVER TIME TO. REPLY TO. I AM I JUST WANNA GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COMMISSION AS WE ARE A STATE MARKETING PROGRAM UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WE WERE ESTABLISHED BY AN ACT OF THE LEGISLATURE SO WE ARE ABOUT THERE'S ABOUT FIFTY DIFFERENT COMMODITY MARKING GROUPS THAT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE BUT WE HAVE A CO OVERSIGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS WELL. OUR STATE AGENCY AND- FOLLOW THE OPEN. MEETING RULES THAT THAT OTHER STATE AGENCIES FOLLOW. EXCEPT THAT THIS IS A VERY SMALL GROUP BUT THE FISHERMEN OTHER DIVERS. HAVE TO PAY THE MANDATORY SUSSMAN AND EVERY FIVE YEARS WE COME UP FOR A RENEWAL. WHETHER THE INITIALLY WANTS TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE AND TO WORK ON THEIR BEHALF SO WE CAN GET WE- WE DO MARKETING PROMOTION. AND A LITTLE BIT OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS AND SO. I JUST LIKE TO JUST GIVE A LITTLE PLUG AS TO WHAT WE ARE- THE SEARCH INDUSTRY IS NOW- STRANGER TO HAVING. AND SOME BAD TIMES AND RIGHT NOW THEY'RE GOING THROUGH SOME REALLY LONG BAD TIMES I WILL. GET INTO A WITH MY PRESENTATION. WE HAVE A FEW LOOK AT THE OVERALL HISPID LASTS AS A TEN YEARS OF OUR FISHERY. I'M IT'S BEEN PRETTY STEADY TO ABOUT TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE WAR MORE BLOOD. CAME CAME AROUND AND STARTED TO KILL OFF THE KELP AND IT WAS ADDRESSED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER SPEAKERS I WON'T GO INTO THAT. BUT YOU CAN START SEEING THAT AROUND TWO FIFTEEN. THAT THERE WAS A STARTING TO SEE IT A DOWNTURN. AND IN THAT I STARTED TO REALLY- SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL MORE SO IN THE NORTH AND THEN IN THE SOUTH AND SO WE DID APPLY. FOR DISASTER DECLARATION WE DID GET IT- LATE LAST YEAR AND THEN WE DID OF GET ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE ARE- WE WERE PROOF THREE POINT THREE MILLION. BUT I'D LIKE TO SHOW ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THAT PICTURE OF WHAT A NORMAL OCEAN BOTTOM PLATE WITH BREADS WE HOPE IS RED. GINS BUT ON THIS BEEN ABOUT. PURPLE THEY'RE JUST UP THANK YOU TO THE FLOOR. A FOREIGN REASONS THE STARFISH- HAS. DIED OFF BECAUSE THE WARM WATER AND JUST ALLOW THE PROPOSED TO EXPLODE. AND THEY ARE ALL THE URGENCY JUST EMPTY SHELVES THAT THERE'S NO ROLE IN AND SAYS THERE'S NOTHING MUCH TO PICK. BUT WHEN YOU COMBINE AND ALSO THE DISASTROUS. BASED ON VALUE OF HOW THAT YEAR A COMPARISON PASSED A PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS- THE KIND OF GETS MASS BUT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE POUNDAGE AND THAT GETS LOST BECAUSE- AS- AS WE- PUNISH. BEGINS A DECREASE VALUE PER POUND STARTS TO INCREASE AND SO IT KIND OF GETS MASS BUT- IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE POUNDAGE. YOU SEE- IN THE NORTH DOWN TO FIFTY SIX ALMOST FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS CMPARED TO WHERE THEY WORK IN OVER THREE MILLION. JUST VERY DRAMATIC AND WE SEEN SOMEONE OF A CHANGES IN THE SOUTH AS WELL. SO IT IS VERY DRAMATIC AND WE HAVE A LOT OF- DIVERS. THAT HAVE- JUST LEFT THE FISHERY WE HAVE ABOUT- THREE HUNDRED DIVERSE WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SOON BUT TWO SEVENTY RIGHT NOW. AND ABOUT THE FIFTY TO SEVENTY THAT ARE REALLY JUST ACTIVE AND IN KEEPING WITH THE IN THE NORTH. I UNDERSTAND ABOUT TWO OR THREE DIVER THAT ARE REALLY. ACTIVELY DIVING THESE DAYS IT'S JUST NOT MUCH THERE. AS I MENTIONED- WITH YOUR ASSISTANCE AND YOUR LEADERSHIP- CENTER HE HELPED US GET THE- THE GOVERNOR DECLARATION- REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE- BACK IN- AND FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE APPROVED THE DISASTER REQUEST IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR AS YOU'D OF LAST YEAR. AND WE JUST FOUND OUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION WAS- ALLOCATED. SO BUT- THAT WAS TWENTY NINETEEN ALSO BEEN DECIMATED AS YOU SAW IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. AND WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING YOUR HELP TO JUST KIND OF PUSHED THINGS ALONG WITH- WITH A REQUEST TO THE GOVERNOR. OBVIOUSLY THE GOVERNOR'S BECAUSE HANDS FULL WITH OTHER DISASTERS THAT ARE GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND WE FULLY APPRECIATE OF THAT THAT THIS IS GOING MANY. ON TOP OF THIS BOOK. DO HAVE THE FISH IN THE THAT THAT IS FREE AND HAPPY SO. FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. AS YOU JUST MENTIONED AND I WAS WITH A FRIEND AT THE TIME JUST THAT AND THEN- SPREAD SHEET THAT YOU PROVIDED YES IN THE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BOTH ON- TOTAL TURN- POUNDS. AND DOLLAR VALUE. JUST STAGGERING YES ARE YOU SEEN THE DECREASE I A AGAIN THANK YOU SO SPECIAL IN THE NORTH JUST UNBELIEVABLE A PEOPLE HAVING A VERY VERY HARD TIME ONLY GOSH. YEAH SO TO HELP WITH THIS THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE- LOOKED AT A KELP RESTORATION BECAUSE THE KELP DIED OFF AND SPOKE. MORE SO IN IN YOUR DISTRICT ALONG THE ON IN MINUTES IN CANYON CINEMA COUNTY. I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO ALLOCATING ABOUT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. WITH THE- AN ABUNDANCE OF MONEY FROM CALLS COME FROM THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND ALSO THE WATERMAN'S ALLIANCE THEY THEY'RE PUTTING IN MONEY AS WELL. SO A TO THE TOTAL OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. WE ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED THAT THAT THAT EFFORTS GOING ON HOWEVER MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. I'M HOPING THAT WITH THE ALLOCATION OF THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS WE CAN. GIVE DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO. THE FISHERMEN AND ALSO THE COMMERCIAL BUYERS. BUT ALSO PUT MONEY TOWARDS ON RESTORATION AS WELL AND ENHANCE THESE PROJECTS. ABOUT ONE MINUTE ONE MINUTE LEFT ALMOST AT THE VERY AND- AS FAR AS HELP- IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE TWO BILLS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH OR AT LEAST HAVE BEEN ENTERED- IS ONE IS AB TWENTY SIX NINETY SEVEN. I UNDERSTAND THIS MIGHT BE A SPOT BILL BUT JUST IN CASE THIS IS TO TAKE- THE- THE DIVING LICENSE PERMIT. AND MOVE IT OUT OF THE STATE- EFFORTS. WHERE YOU'RE CONTROLLING THE FUHRMAN PERMIT FEES. AND MOVED OVER TO THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. THAT'S TRUE- WE WOULD LIKE TO BECOME MALLS AND HAVE THE DIALOGUE AND JUST. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN HELPING US MAINTAIN THAT RELATIONSHIP UP THAT WOULD BE CAN BE HEARD. NOT SAY IT IS. TERRIBLY WRONG BUT IT'S- I. PULL THAT OUT. SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN. A LICENSES. AND THE AB THIRD THE RATE CUT. PHILIP TENS AND I SAY THAT IS AN OLD EFFORT. IN NOBLE GOAL. BUT TO PROTECT 30% OF THE CONS. BY A TWENTY THREE BUT THE FISH INDUSTRY YOU KNOW ALREADY SERVICE BY HAVING SEASONS WE HAVE SIZE LIMITS AND AN H. WHEELS OF THE MPAS OF INPUT AND THAT'S ALSO COMPACTED ARE ARE AT LEAST THE DIVERS- INTO SMALLER SMALLER AREAS AND ASK THE TAKE ON MORE OF A BURDEN MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR- HELP. AND GUIDANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR- OUR WORDS ARE HEARD WE LOOK FOR THE WORKING SIR THANK YOU AND THEN I THINK I'M DONE THIS IS WHAT WE REALLY STRIVE FOR- AND THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GET BACK TO THAT. IF YOU DON'T WANNA TOUCH OF ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN TO FIFTEEN SECONDS A DIRECTOR BONTA MENTIONED THAT THE- I'M IN A DISASTER I WAS JUST A PLAGUE THEN I'D LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT TO KNOW OPPENHEIM AND ROB ROSS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE PANEL WE WORK TOGETHER I ALSO MANAGE THE- FORTY SEVEN COUNCIL. IT'S BEEN A VERY ROUGH ROAD- THIS LOTS OF DIVERGENT ISSUE- CONSIDER IS IT WAS A FISHERMAN COMMERCIAL BUYERS THE PARTIAL- FISHING PASS DIVEST OPERATORS ALSO IN AND- EVER FISH GUIDES AND SO. CAN IN THEM ALL TO FIGURE OUT- AND WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO. DEVELOP WAS OF STRUGGLE. WE WILL PASS. OF THE OTHER APARTMENT IN OVER. A ONE TO GIVE AT THAT TO THE OTHER PARTNERS FOR HELPING US. PUSH THROUGH NO REAL FISHY TO THINK SO MUCH MISTER BY SHARED A LOOK AT THAT. AFTER AND IT'S LIKE. I KNOW AT. THE TENNIS HEY THE NEXT YEAR. HER HIGH. AREA ALL RIGHT EIGHT THINK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE FLOOR. TO I WAS HELLO WELL IS A- THE CAL. IN COMMITTEE ON SCENE. IN STILL HAD TO THE FLOORS. YET ONE MINUTE YOU'RE FIVE ON THE ONE MINUTE. WELCOME THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE ASSEMBLY MISS DAWN AND TOM WAS SLOW. IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR- A KNOWLEDGE OF LAST NIGHT IT ENCOURAGING. WHEN SOMETIMES YOU DON'T SEE THE RESULT OF YOUR WORK IN THIS FIELD WHEN YOU'RE PROTECTING RESOURCES. I DON'T KNOW I SEE THE RESULT. WELL. THIS I CAN'T TELL YOU. I'M FILLING IN HERE FOR TWO DURING MOREAU TO. WHO HAD SOME ISSUE. AS A BUSY YEAR FOR THE CAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FONDLY KNOWN AS THE SHE A SHE- OUR MEETINGS THIS YEAR FOCUSED ON CENTRAL VALLEY HATCHERY MANAGEMENT. THE FISHERIES RESTORATION GRANT PROGRAM PEER REVIEW COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT'S AD HOC RESTORATION LEADERS COMMITTEE AND ONGOING GRANT PROGRAM REFORM AND OVERSIGHT. ALSO THE JOINT STATE FEDERAL COASTAL MONITORING PROGRAM OR CMP. AND SITES RESERVOIR ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TRINITY RIVER DIVISION AND THE NEED FOR SCIENCE BASED MINIMUM BYPASS FLOWS IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AMONG UPCOMING ISSUES ARE STOCKS IN THE OCEAN OUR OCEANS SEVEN FISHERIES ARE NOT IN A RECOVERY TRAJECTORY. THE SACRAMENTO RIVER SEVEN ABUNDANCE APPEARS BETTER THAN OTHER RIVERS THE KLAMATH IS STILL SUFFERING GREATLY FROM C. SHASTA INFECTION OF JUVENILE FISH BELIEVED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THIS YEAR'S POOR ABUNDANCE. WE HAVE GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DAM REMOVAL CURRENTLY EXPECTED IN TWO YEARS WILL ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. OUR PRELIMINARY EEL RIVER MONITORING INDICATES ABOUT HALF AS MANY FISH AS LAST YEAR WHICH WERE ALREADY VERY LOW COMPARED TO RECENT YEARS. AS A RESULT COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN THE NORTH WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ECONOMIC DISTRESS AND FISHERIES REMAINS SEVERELY CURTAILED. IN THESE DOWN YEARS WE LOOK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD ON FUNDING TO INVEST IN WATERSHED IN FISHERIES RESTORATION. AND WE ALSO LOOK TO STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE IN MANAGEMENT HATCHERY OPERATIONS AND TO SPEED UP THE PACE OF RESTORATION PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE HATCHERY RELEASE STRATEGIES AND RELEASE LOCATIONS ARE CRITICAL. TO BOOST HATCHERY FISH SURVIVAL AND WE ENCOURAGE AGENCY MANAGERS TO WORK WITH OUR COMMERCIAL SPORT AND TROUBLE SALMON REPRESENTATIVES TO CONSIDER OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. ALSO WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO REBUILD OUR FALL RUN SALMON STOCKS IN AREAS IMPACTED BY DROUGHT AND POUR WATER MANAGEMENT. THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SITES RESERVOIR. THE DRAFT E. I. S. E. R. E. I. R. HAS NUMEROUS DEFICIENCIES AND THE SIZE PROJECT AT THIRTY HAS RESISTED REQUEST TO RECIRCULATE. THE DRAFT THE I. S. P. I. R. FIRST THE MODELING CALLED FOR MINIMUM BYPASS FLOWS AS LOW AS THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CFS AT RED BLUFF WHEN. DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAS RECOMMENDED NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND CFS. OF THOSE LOW. FLOWS WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO SEVEN RUNS. SECONDLY THE MODELING SHOWS IMPACTS TO THE TRINITY RIVER THROUGH A SHIFT IN TIMING OF DIVERSIONS THAT INCREASES TEMPERATURES DURING CRITICAL SPAWNING PERIODS IN THE FALL. THIRD TO SEE A SEAT NOT SUPPORT FAST TRACKING OF SITES AND OTHER NEW RESERVOIRS AS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S DRAFT WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO. ADDITIONALLY THIS HE IS HE DOES NOT SUPPORT VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS AS A REPLACEMENT FOR REGULATORY REGULATORY FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR VARIOUS RIVERS THIS APPROACH HAS FAILED IN THE PAST IN OTHER CASES. THE NINETY FOUR BAY DELTA ACCORD THE TWO THOUSAND CAL FED RECORD OF DECISION THE CALIPHATE ENVIRONMENTAL WATER ACCOUNT AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN V. S. A. FOR ORVILLE RELICENSING ARE EXAMPLES. AND THE SALMON AND STEELHEAD RUNS CONTINUE TO DECLINE. REGARDING CENTRAL VALLEY WATER OPERATIONS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO REVISIT PERMITS ISSUED TO THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF RECLAMATION. THAT ALLOW IT TO DE WATER UP THE UPPER SACRAMENTO AND OVERHEAT THE RIVER TO LEVELS LETHAL TO INCUBATING SALMON EGGS AFTER THE WINTER RUN TEMPERATURE CONTROL SEASON EXPIRES. AND ENCOURAGED TO RECALL OF REQUIRE THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION TO FIX THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL DEVICE ON FOLSOM DAM. FOR NEW A THE OFFICIAL WALLET POSITIONS WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT ECHNICAL STUDIES PRIORITIZATION OF GRANT PROJECTS PERMITTING AND ESPECIALLY SUPPORT FOR MONITORING THESE ALL SUPPORT THEY INVESTMENT THE STATE'S INVESTMENT OF IN RESTORATION. AND SHOWING THAT IT WORKS ONE MINUTE. THE CSE APPLAUDS THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE INITIATIVE AS WELL AS DIRECTOR BOTTOMS BONHAM'S STE BETTER STRONGER FASTER PROGRAM. NOW WE WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR FUNDING THE KING FISHER FLAT HATCHERY BRUCE DOT PROGRAM ENCOURAGE MORE FUNDING OF THAT TYPE OF. CALIFORNIA NEEDS A ROBUST RECOVERY WITH A HARVESTABLE SURPLUS OF OUR VITAL SALMON STOCKS THE SUPPORT COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE STILL FIGHTING AN UPSTREAM BATTLE TO EVEN REVERSE THE DECLINE. WE THANK THE JOINT FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE COMMITTEE IN THESE TOUGH TIMES FOR SALMON FOR YOUR SUPPORT. HELLO THANK YOU SO MUCHAND AGAIN WELL DESERVE LAST NIGHT PRETTY EXCITING SO VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOU WORK AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU PROVIDER HEARING US YEAH WHEN I TURN IT OVER TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUSTS- MISS WHITE MEN AND AT THIS IS A REALLY NICE FOR SURE THAT YOU IN AND OUT AS WELL. LOOKS GREAT. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TELLING THE HEARING BY AN HOUR BECAUSE IT MEANT I GOT YOU THAT TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY REPORTS. THERE REALLY IT'S REALLY THIS IS A WONDERFUL REPORT BY THE WAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY JUST REITERATE MY NAME IS LIZ WHITE MEN AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE- CALIFORNIA OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST. AND UNIQUE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION ESTABLISHED BY CALIFORNIA STATUTE. QUICK REMINDER ABOUT US MY ANNUAL REMINDER TO YOU- WE BELIEVE THAT SCIENCE CAN ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE STATE VERSION OF A HEALTHY COAST IN THE OCEAN AND- AND HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE. AND WE TAKE PRIDE IN AS A NON PROFIT NIMBLE RESPONSE TO OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCIENCE TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE POLICY DOT. ORG AS A SMALL T. IN OUR ABILITY TO POT NOT THE DOOR ON AND- INTO THE BEST EXPERTISE AVAILABLE AT. PLANTS DEVISED TO THE PROTECTION COUNCIL. OF FOCUS ON. RETURN ON STATE AND SCIENCE INVESTMENTS IN JUST TO. APPOINT BY ASSEMBLYMAN SOONER. WAS THAT MEANS I'M- VICE RECOMMEND. THAT CA MAKE. APPROACHES THE MAKE THE BEST. IF XIN USE OF I AM. STATE RESOURCES. SO ABSOLUTE ON ON ON PER STATE AS WHERE TO DRAW IN FEDERAL FEDERAL FULLER. AND PRY. MONEY SUPPORT OF STATE PARTIES. SO I'VE TO PRY UPDATE FOR YOU TODAY I AM VERY QUICKLY FIRST WE ARE REQUIRED BY A FUNDING LEGISLATION TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO YOU AND TODAY I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT OUR- BI ANNUAL REPORTS- CATCH UP MOVED. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN WITH TIME TO HIGHLIGHT TO ANY ONE THING FOM THAT REPORTS I WANTED TO MENTION THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. WITH SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEWS OF THE FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLANS ALL COMPONENTS WITHIN AND DO OUR PART TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FOR TREES. IT'S A LOW OUT BY MANY I'M- PLAYED IT COOL AND BIGGER ROLE IN. ABOUT BUT THE FEW YEARS WE'RE PROUD OF OUR SMALL PIECE- TO DEVELOP A PEER REVIEW PROCESS- IN WHICH THE SCIENCE AND THE OUTCOME. BENEFITTED FROM THE INPUT OF STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES SOMETHING THAT IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE WORLD OF CLASSIC PEER REVIEW IN THE SCIENCE. COMMUNITY IS JUST A WORLD APART FROM THE CLASSIC EXPECTATIONS. AND I THINK THE PRINCIPLES OF- SORT OF INCLUSION OF A DIVERSE SET OF EXPERTISE AND- IT THAT PROCESS. FULL TO OTHER TOPICS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HERE TODAY. AND MY SECOND UPDATE TO IS TO ANNOUNCE THAT- I WOULD MY NOTES SAY THIS MORNING BUT IT WAS THAT SHE THIS AFTERNOON- WE RELEASED OUR TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY REPORTS- I HAVE COPIES HERE AND IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. IN IT WE REFLECT ON THE SUCCESSES AND IMPACT OF THE LAST TWO DECADES BUT I WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY O THANK ALL MANY POT KNOWS FROM THE STATE'S INCLUDING THE OCEAN PROTECTION. AND SO I COULD GIVE ME A NONPROFIT SON PRIVATE INDUSTRY- ALSO THIS IS A REALLY ONLY A RESULT OF THE STRENGTH OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS.

HATCHERY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO PICK A FIGHT WITH THE DEPARTMENT BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS ON THE WAY THAT WE ARE HANDLING OUR HATCHERIES AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH SOME OF THESE HATCHERY FISH. LIKE THIS VIDEO TO BETTER I ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WE'D LIKE YOUR COMMITTEE HONESTLY TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT- UPDATE ISN'T IT. I REQUEST ABOUT IT BUT WE- GIVE THAT THERE ARE PRACTICES WE COULD HAVE. ON ENHANCE OUR FISHERIES- AND THAT WOULD NOT COST US A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE LIMITING FACTOR WHEN IT COMES TO THESE THINGS ARE PARTNERS A PC FFA AND- G. SSA AND THE OTHER RECREATIONAL SPORT FISHING GROUPS OF THINK WOULD. SOLVE THE AGREE WITH US. THAT BRINGS ME TO MY REQUEST. JUST WANT TO ADVISE YOU THAT WE EXPECT TO SEND A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE ASKING YOU TO HOLD A HEARING PERHAPS THIS YEAR OR AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR ON. THE STATE OF OUR RECREATIOAL FISHERY- THIS IS A GREAT HEARING TODAY- WE HAVE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SPORTFISHING- THAT TAKES PLACE IN THE OCEAN AND SOME OF IT IN LONDON HOW DECISIONS MANAGEMENT DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE. ARE OFTEN MADE IN CONCERT WITH- BOTH ENVIRONMENTS PRICKLY FOR ANADROMOUS SPECIES BUT- WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A HEARING FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INLAND RECREATIONAL SPORT FISHING- THAT'S- BASS STRIPED BASS BLACK BASS IN THE DELTA. SAM IN OUR INLAND RIVERS IT'S OUR KOKANEE PROGRAMS IT'S OUR TROUT PROGRAMS. IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS- AND YOU KNOW IN THAT WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. PREPS REASONS WHY THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL ANGLING LICENSES THAT IS SOLD HAVE GONE DOWN BY ONE POINT TWO MILLION SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT RECREATIONAL.

THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US HELLO AGAIN- I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TIME YOU'VE TALKED TO- TALK WITH ME LAST NIGHT MY NAME IS. KIM ZELKO I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN OF SANTA BARBARA- OUR PORT ASSOCIATION AND I'M ALSO A MARINE SCIENTIST AFFILIATED WITH UCSB. THE OWNER OF A COMMUNITIES OF FISHER PROGRAM GET. AND I'M HERE TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON OUR LOBSTER FISHERY OURS CALIFORNIA SPINY LOBSTER FISHERY HAS HAD A VERY TOUGH YEAR- WE HAVE NORMALLY A- THE- DOCKSIDE PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A POUND- TO THE FISHERMEN. IT FELL TO ABOUT TWELVE DOLLARS A POUND TO THE CHINESE RETALIATES TERRY- TERRACE IN THE FALL WHEN THE- SEASON OPENED AND THEN. IN GETTING READY FOR CHINESE NEW YEAR OF THE PRICE FELL THE AGAIN TO ABOUT EIGHT DOLLARS WHEN TRYING TO CLOSE THE MARKET DUE TO CORONA VIRUS- SO IT EFFECTIVELY ENDED OUR SEASON. OF IN THIS FOLLOWS ON CLOSURES THAT HAPPENED AS LAST SEASON FROM DEMO OKAY ACID AS WELL SO WE'VE HAD A TOUGH TIME AND I WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION. OR SOUTHERN FISHERIES DOWN OFF OFTEN GET NOTICED- UP HERE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM THE URCHIN FISHING IS THAT GETTING A DOMESTIC MARKET GOING CAN BE VERY HELPFUL WITH THESE HUGE GLOBAL FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKETS. ARE LOBSTER MARKET- IS ENTIRELY AN EXPORT MARKET AND WE REALLY NEED NEW TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS TO. MARK FOR LAPSED. THAT WOULD. BEING ABLE TO TAKE ALL THE LOBSTER OR DO OTHER PROCESSING IT WOULD CREATE PRODUCTS LIKE FOR MY- A COMMUNITY SUPPORTED FISSURED LOVE TO MAKE LOBSTER RAVIOLI LOBSTER STOCK IN THAT IS COMPLETELY. NOT ALLOWED AN OFFICIATING CODE EVEN THE- IN LOBSTER. ZOOMER AS- A MEASURABLE PRODUCTS- AND SO I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH THE FISHING GAME. ON CHANGING THIS THIS YEAR- AND I HOPE THAT WOULD HAVE YOUR SUPPORT- ANOTHER THING THAT COULD REALLY HELP IS TO ADD TO SB. ONE OF ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT- THAT PROVIDES FOR EVISCERATION OF DUNGENESS CRAB IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHEN TO MOW GRASS IS A PROBLEM- ADD TO THAT LOBSTER AND- ROCK CRAB A ROCK CRABS SUFFERS THE SAME FATE AS DUNGEON S. UNDER DEMOC ACID EVENTS. AND YET THERE'S NO MENTION OF ROCK CRAB OR LOBSTER IN SP. ELEVEN TWENTY EIGHT SO I HOPE WE CAN REMEDY THAT AND THAT'LL PUT US ON A PATHWAY TO- HOPING WHETHER DOMESTIC MARKETS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME. OUT YESTERDAY EVENING.
