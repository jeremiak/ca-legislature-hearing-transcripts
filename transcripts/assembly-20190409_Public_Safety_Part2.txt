FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL -- THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE A STUDY BILL NUMBER REPEAT A STUDY BILL WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAY IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. EXCESSIVE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENT WARNED YOU IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES NOT. ONLY PRODUCE PHYSICAL. EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AFFECTS WHAT ALSO INTERFERES WITH THE REHABILITATION BY ENDANGERING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U. AND THE STAFF. MY GOAL IS TO GATHER DATA. LET ME REPEAT MY GOAL IS TO GATHER DATA SO THAT THE LA -- CAN GIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE CURRENTLY DETENTION FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO DOCUMENT. EACH TIME A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER USE FORCE INCLUDING THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENT THIS BILL SEEKS TO TAKE -- THIS EXISTING DATA AND REQUIRE IT TO BE REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF STATE COULDN'T -- CORRECTIONS WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE U. LAWCENTER WHO WAS SELF INTRODUCE. HI. MY NAME IS LUCY SALCEDO CARTER BUT ACTUALLY I'M GONNA HAVE MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM MEAL. OF GO FIRST. GOOD AFTERNOON WHEN ASKED OF THE TO THE COMMITTEE NOW PRESENT HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS EVERYBODY WHAT A NUMBER YOUTH LEADER PROGRAM ASSISTANT AT ME BY. IN SALINAS AS WELL AS A COLLEGE STUDENT MAJORING IN BILINGUAL BICULTURAL STUDIES. AS A FORMAL INCARCERATED YOUTH WHO NOW WORKS CLOSELY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE I'VE GAINED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS. THAT CHEMICAL AGENTS. HAS ON YOU SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND I AM HERE TODAY TO SHARE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE MANY TIMES I WAS INCARCERATED AS A YOUTH I FOUND MYSELF AT THE RECEIVING END OF A BEING CHEMICALLY SPRAYED. BEING SUPPOSED TO CHEMICALS BUT WAS NOT RARE IT WAS A NORMALIZED EVERYDAY TYPE EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCE BEING PEPPER SPRAYED. FOR DOING THINGS LIKE NOT LINING UP PROPERLY TO GET FOOD OR NOT SITTING IN MY ASSIGNED SEAT. CHEMICAL SPRING NOT ONLY BRINGS JUST FOR A DAY BEFORE WE GET TIMES CAUSING BOIL SKIN PEELING AND THE WORST PART MAKING EATING A DIFFICULT TASK. THE REALITY WAS IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN I WAS SPRAYED I FELT ATTACKED HUMILIATED AND ALONE WITH NO ONE TO ASK FOR HELP. FIRE DOES NOT PUT OUT FIRE BUT RATHER BUILDS ON THE IN MY EXPERIENCE THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS ON YOUTH ONLY SERVE AS ANOTHER BARRIER. TO REALLY ESTABLISH THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN YOUTH AND STAFF THAT CAN LEAD TO THE PATH OF REHABILITATION. I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO COMMIT TO THE IDEA OF THIS BILL THAT WOULD GATHER THE DATA AND AND AND AND AND NOW THIS IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO FIND ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND TRAUMA HEALING INFORMED PROGRAMS. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES TO MENTION A FEW. THAT WOULD AID IN THE OVERALL WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIAN CAR SHOULD BE YOU'VE. I STRONGLY REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT THE LIMIT OF OUR CREATIVITY AND IMAGINATION AND CHEMICAL AGENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND BELIEVE CALIFORNIA CAN GET THIS RIGHT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR FACILITIES AND HELP US DEVELOP A PATH FORWARD TOGETHER [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS LUCY SELFIE THE CARTER ON THE POLICY ADVOCATE AT THE YOUTH LAWCENTER. SO WE HEARD FROM MYSTERY BATA. ABOUT HIS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES WITH BEING SPRAYED IN JUVENILE FACILITIES AND WATCHING OTHER YOUTH GET SPRAYED. WE ALSO HAVE PLENTY OF RESEARCH SHOWING THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HARMS TO YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BEING SPREAD. WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN FACTORS EXACERBATE THOSE HARMS INCLUDING PRE EXISTING RESPIRATORY OR GEE I CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA. OR EXPOSURE TO TRAUMA AND THESE ARE FACTORS THAT ARE PRESENT IN MANY YOUTH IN CUSTODY. WE ALSO KNOW THAT AS SOON AS THE FEDERAL MONITORING OF CONDITIONS IN LA COUNTY JUVENILE PROBATION FACILITY STOPPED. THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAY IN THOSE FACILITIES SKYROCKETED. INCREASING 210023100% IN SOME FACILITIES. WE ALSO NOTE THAT. A FEW JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT USE SPRAY AND MOST JURISDICTIONS NATIONWIDE DO NOT USE SPRAY. IN THE JUVENILE FACILITIES. AND LA COUNTY IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A PLAN TO STOP THE USE OF SPRAY IN THEIR FACILITIES BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW? IS HOW OFTEN THIS HARMFUL PRACTICES BEING USED ON YOUTH IN JUVENILE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. UNDER CURRENT REGULATIONS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON STATED PROBATION HAS TO COLLECT THESE DATA. BUT THEY ARE NOT SHARED PUBLICLY. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT LA COUNTY'S USE OF CAM SPRAY BECAUSE THE PRESS GOT A HOLD OF SOME DATA AND BECAUSE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DECIDED TO REVIEW. USE. WE KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE IS CONTROVERSIAL. AND THAT THERE IS RESISTANCE TO GIVING UP OLD FAMILIAR PRACTICES BUT WE WANT JUVENILE JUSTICE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF AND THE SHAPE THESE POLICIES WE NEED DATA AND WE NEED RESEARCH. IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHEN THE ISSUE IS SO CONTROVERSIAL. TO SHAPE GOOD POLICIES WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS WORKING WELL IN OTHER LOCALES LOCALES OF STOP USING THESE PRACTICES AND ARE STILL KEEPING YOUTH AND STAFF SAFE. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY ONE WILL ALLOW POLICY MAKERS TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING STATEWIDE WITH REGARD TO USE OF CAM SPRAY AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT OTHER LOCALES HAVE FIGURED OUT. THAT WORK BETTER TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC SAFETY AND REHABILITATION GOALS OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND FOR THOSE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

ONE FIVE ZERO ONE LOW FORENSIC BALLISTIC AND FIREARMS PROCEDURES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- HE SAID IT -- ALREADY WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFINITION HERE -- BUT WANT TO GIVE YOU EXAMPLE OF THE UTILITY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY A CRIME WAS ABLE TO LINK COVER COVERED GUN TO BALLISTICS EVIDENCE AND THREE SHOOTINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE INVESTIGATORS USED NOW I'VE BEEN TO CONNECT THIS CARTED GUN. TWO THREE OTHER RECENT SHOOTINGS THAT PLAGUE TOOK PLACE FROM FREMONT TO OUR LINDA WITH ME AT OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT REPRESENTING. A DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEFF ROSEN FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THANK YOU MY NAME IS MICHAEL VIDMAR WHO DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND THE GUN CRIMES PROSECUTOR FOR OUR OFFICE WHICH FALLS IN FOR CRIME STRATEGIES UNIT TEAM. GUN VIOLENCE PLACE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA LEAVING A DEVASTATING A COSTLY TRAIL WORTHY OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC RESOURCES. HOWEVER THERE IS AN EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTION AVAILABLE. IT IS PROVEN TO SOLVE GUN CRIMES AND WE URGE THIS BODY TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN NO ONE TO HELP IDENTIFY YOUR MOST VIOLENT CRIMINALS AND BRING THEM TO JUSTICE. BY TAKING CRIME GUNS AND SHELL CASINGS FROM EVERY CRIME SCENE WHERE AGAIN WAS USED. ANALYZING THEM AND ENTERING THEM IT'S THE NATIONAL DATABASE WE CAN LEARN LINK UNSOLVED GUN CRIMES. AND USE THE INFORMATION LEARNED TO BUILD A CASE THAT SOLVES MULTIPLE CRIMES. WE KNOW THIS TESTING WORKS HE DRAMATIC EXAMPLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY UNEXPECTED LINKS BETWEEN SHOOTINGS HAVE WHAT'S THE APPREHENSION SHOOTING OF PROSECUTION OF SHOOTERS. BUT IT REQUIRES EVERYONE TO TEST THEIR GUNS IN CASINGS ALL OF THE TIME. SENSIBLE IMPLEMENTING THE GUN RELATED INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY CRIME LAB HAS IDENTIFIED HUNDREDS OF LINKED SHOOTINGS INCLUDING MURDERS. ATTEMPTED MURDERS CARJACKINGS ARM ROBBERIES AND DRIVE BY SHOOTINGS. WITHOUT THIS LAW WE KNOW THAT MURDER WEAPONS ARE GONNA BE REMAINING ON SHELVES AND TESTED. WE KNOW THE CRITICAL LEAVES IN SHOOTING SPREES ARE GONNA REMAIN IMPROPER TO ROOMS. NOT BEING UTILIZED. THIS BILL WILL CLOSE THIS USING COSTLY GAP AND THIS IS NOT A NEW TECHNOLOGY. THIS BILL MANDATES THAT WE HARNESS THE POWER OF TOOLS WE ALREADY HAVE TO COMMUTE KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS CONCERNS ABOUT COSTS AND WE SHARE THE CONCERN ANTICIPATE FUTURE DEBATE ABOUT FUNDINGS. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THIS THE VITAL TECHNOLOGY WORTHY OF EFFORT IN FUNDING AND GIVEN THE EXPENSE OF A SINGLE HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION THE COST THIS PROGRAM SEEMS UNDENIABLY WORTH THE EFFORT INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE INVALUABLE LEADS. IN OUR MOST SERIOUS CASES. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO SHOW COMMITMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN THIS REGARD SUPPORTING PROVING GUN TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF GUN CRIME VICTIMS AROUND THE STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES. AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA. SO MANY CRIME GUNS GO UNSOLVED. AND SADLY AS MANY OF OUR ODD BRADY CHAPTER MEMBERS AROUND THE STATE NO AN UNSOLVED CRIME IS VERY HARD AND VICTIMS WHO ARE SEEKING ANSWERS AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACT THAT ARM CRIMINALS WHO ARE NOT IDENTIFIED AND APPREHENDED -- ARE IN THE POSITION WHERE THEY CAN INFLICT MORE HARM. THEREFORE IS IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY TO SOLVE CRIMES AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SHARING OF BALLISTIC INFORMATION HELPS TO SOLVE CRIMES IT'S GOOD POLICY -- THE BRADY CAMPAIGN STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE INTERNSHIP INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF POLICE. AND THAT RECOMMENDATION IS THE TIMELY PROCESSING OF CRIME GUN TEST FIRES A BALLISTIC EVIDENCE THROUGH. NINE THE RESOLUTION RESOLUTION FINDS A BALLISTIC EVIDENCE FROM A CRIME GUM CAN BE USED TO LINK A FIREARM TO PRIOR PRIOR CRIMES AND TO LINK TO OR MARK CRIMES TOGETHER AND CAN PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WITH TIMELY. AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION TO HELP IT AND DENTAL FIVE AND APPREHEND ARM SUSPECTS BEFORE THEY DO MORE HARM AND YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT HOW THAT IS USED -- AS A MATTER POLICY I DON'T THINK THIS IS CONTROVERSIAL AT ALL HI THE HANG UP OF COURSE IS THE COST -- EXISTING LAW PERMITS LOCAL JR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO SUBMIT THE LANGUAGE ARTS SUBMIT THAT BALLISTICS EVIDENCE THIS BILL REQUIRE THEM TO DO THAT AGAIN AS A MATTER OF POLICY. THIS MAKES SENSE TO GOOD POLICY AND MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO HAVE THE FUNDING DEBATE IN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHERE BELONGS WAS A PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. I READ YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CALVIN QUICK WITH BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE A WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A HALF OFF ON GIVE US A FEW SECONDS. WELCOME. TO ENTER THE EXPRESS THIS. A LOT OF AND WITH THE SYSTEM PROCESSES MANY THINGS MOVING ARE YOU IN SUPPORT. OF MR BONTA I MISSED A LOW'S BILL. FIFTEEN OH ONE SAY YOUR NAME. ORGANIZATION AND THAT YOUR SUPPORT MARISSA MAZA -- FROM RICHMOND CALIFORNIA I'M IN OPPOSITION. ALL OF IT. OKAY THEM WAIT. COME ON MR. CHORUS ALSO. IF YOU MISTER JOHN MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONG WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO TESTING FIREARMS OR TESTING CARTRIDGES THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND AT A CRIME SCENE OR THAT ARE -- THE RESULT OF UNLAWFUL USE -- THE CONCERN HERE I THINK IS IS TWO FOLD ONE IS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED THE THE THE COSTLY UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT THIS BILL PROPOSES. AS MISS WILCOX SAYS THAT. THE CURRENT LAW PERMITS THE SORT OF THING TO HAPPEN IT HAPPENS AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE NOW AS RESOURCES AND TIME IN INVESTIGATIONS PERMIT -- BUT BECAUSE THE BILL CONTAINS NO FUNDING IT'S IT'S A IT'S A HARD CONVERSATION HAVE. A FURTHER WERE WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS PRIORITIZE THE TESTING OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EVIDENCE. FROM CERTAIN CRIME SCENES OR CERTAIN SITUATIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS SO. THERE'S NO SORT OF PRIORITIZATION THERE'S NO SORT OF MENTION OF WILL WINDOWS THIS GUN GET TESTER WHEN THIS CAR JUST GET TESTED. THIS WOULD BE A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE THAT THIS TYPE OF PARTICULAR EVIDENCE BE PROCESSED. AND PRESUMABLY IT GOES TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE AHEAD OF ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THERE'S NO LANGUAGE THAT THAT INDICATES ONE WAY OR THE OTHER -- MANY TYPES OF EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION ROUTINELY GATHER DURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION. TRAIN INVESTIGATOR SHOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TO PROCESS THAT EVIDENCE -- IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INDIVIDUAL SITUATION WITH THE BENEFIT OF THEIR EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE AND TRAINING -- AND INSTEAD OF MANDATING IT HERE FOR TO SAY EVERY GUN MUST BE TESTED EVERY KARGES MUST BE TESTED -- WE THINK IT'S BEST LEFT TO THOSE -- WITH THE EXPERIENCE ON THE GROUND AND SO RESPECTFULLY FOR THOSE REASONS WITH US YOU KNOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER IN OPPOSITION OF FIFTEEN OH ONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BELL. THEN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESPECT BASS RIVAL. A CHURCH RECOMMENDED AND I AND HOPEFULLY. YOU CAN WORK OUT AS YOU GO TO I GUESS TO APPROACH. OF THE FUNDING AND RESOURCE ISSUE.

AGREEMENT THAT THE FOCUS REALLY IS ON MAKING SURE THAT IT IS DONE IN A LOCAL CITING THAT MAKES SENSE FOR ALL OF THE VARIOUS PARTNERS AND PRACTITIONERS -- THIS WOULD ALIGN WITH BRAIN DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH -- RELATIVE TO TO YOUNG ADULTS AND AND THE FOCUS REALLY IS ON WANTING.

BURKE WE ARE APPROVED YES MISS WICKS. AB SIXTEEN OH THREE ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY NINE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. HI NO THIS IS A IS A TRANSFER TO JUVENILES YEAH NOBODY. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN WILL BE THE ONE ALL YOU DO AYE AB EIGHTEEN FIRST OKAY. SORRY THAT'S WHY I HAVE A TEAM. LEVINE OKAY FIREARMS EXCISE TAX I AM THE BATTLING MY INNER MARC LEVINE OKAY. YEAH THE MARC LEVINE BILL OKAY. AT THANK YOU -- CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW COLLEAGUES ON THIS COMMITTEE AB EIGHTEEN WOULD IMPOSE AN EXCISE TAX ON A RETAILER IN THE AMOUNT OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER FIREARM. ON THE SALE IN THE STATE OF THE ON THE SALE OF THE STATE OF HAND GUNS OR SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES OR SHOTGUNS THE REVENUE GENERATED BY THIS TAX WOULD PROVIDE A STEADY FUNDING STREAM. FOR THE CALVET PROGRAM WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM WHICH THIS BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES IN STATUTE WE KNOW THAT THESE PROGRAMS WORK WE'VE SEEN A REDUCTION GUN VIOLENCE AND MANY OF OUR CITIES. BECAUSE OF THE CAL THE PROGRAMS. THE ECONOMIC COST OF GUNS IN AMERICA IS STAGGERING. ACCORDING TO JOBS JOHNS HOPKINS STUDY U. S. EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS FOR GUNSHOT WOUNDS COST APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION PER YEAR. ANNUAL TOTAL COST ESTIMATES FROM GUN VIOLENCE REACH TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO BILLION. IF MEDICAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAIL OTHER COSTS ARE AGGREGATED AND THIS THE CDC ARE ALSO FOUND THAT FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN GUN HOMICIDES INCREASED AB EIGHTEEN WOULD ENSURE A FUNDING FOR CALVET ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BOLSTER RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SERIOUS VIOLENCE IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WITH ME TODAY IS -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL ARE YOU FREE LOOK FROM DIFFERENCE. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THE TEAM'S CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME SORRY FOR LIKE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER SPRING GUN VIOLENCE AGAINST IF YOU ORGANIZATION LED BY FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN AND GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVOR GABBY GIFFORDS. OUR ORGANIZATIONS TOP PRIORITY IN CALIFORNIA IS TO INCREASE AND STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S INVESTMENT IN PROGRAMS THAT WORK. TO DROP CYCLES OF SHOOTINGS INJURY TRAUMA AND RETALIATION. THAT'S BECAUSE THE STATE OF ACHIEVED THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN RECENT YEARS. HAVE TAKEN MEANINGFUL ACTION ON GUN SAFETY REFORM AND COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT ONGOING FUNDING TO THESE TARGETED PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN CALIFORNIA WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER CHAIRMAN LEGISLATURE ACTED TO REPLICATE THESE BACKS BEST PRACTICES BY CREATING AND FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM CALLED CALVET FOR SHORT. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES COMPETITIVE MATCHING GRANTS FOR CITIES AND CBO'S IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED BROWN'S REDUCTION INITIATIVES AS HELP THE FUNDS IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES IN THE NATION. BUT THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO MEET OUR COMMUNITIES NEEDS. THIS BILL WOULD INCORPORATE LANGUAGE FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS EIGHTY SIXTEEN OH THREE THE BREAK THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE ACT. TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS CONTINUE TO BE DIRECTED TO THE MOST. EFFECTIVE AND TARGET PROGRAMS THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE A REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATELY TARGETED MEANS OF SUSTAINING REVENUE FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE LONG TERM. FARM INDUSTRY TAXES ARE HISTORICALLY LONG STANDING IN THIS COUNTRY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO WHERE THE PITTMAN ROBERTSON ACT HAS SINCE NINETEEN NINETEEN IMPOSED A 10211% TAX ON THE SALE OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION. BY MANUFACTURERS IMPORTERS AND PRODUCERS. BUT NOT FIREARMS SELLERS. REVENUES FROM THIS FEDERAL TAX WHICH WAS DESCRIBED BY THE NRA AS A QUOTE LEGISLATIVE MODEL. AND A QUOTE FRIEND OF THE HUNTER. FUND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT REMEDIATE SOME OF THE IMPACTS FIREARMS HAVE ON WILD ANIMAL POPULATIONS THROUGH HUNTING. THIS BILL WOULD SIMILARLY PLACE A REASONABLE TAX ON THE PART OF OUR MINISTRY EXEMPTED FROM THE FEDERAL TAX COMMERCIAL RETAIL FARM DEALERS. IN ORDER TO HELP REMEDIATE THE DEVASTATING AFFECT THE FARMS BECAUSE MANY HUMAN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED TO PENALIZE FARM SELLERS OR OTHERWISE DISCOURAGE LAWFUL COMMERCE ARE ACTIVITY WHATSOEVER BUT WOULD REASONABLY GENERATE SUSTAINABLE REVENUE FOR IMPORTANT. AND PROPERLY TARGETED BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AN ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF EVERY TOWN FOR GUN SAFETY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ADAM. AMANDA WILCOX BRADY CALIFORNIA UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. CALVIN QUICK WITH BAY AREA STERN ACTIVISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. GET AFTERNOON DOMINIQUE NOW FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY. OTHER WITNESS ANY WOODS IS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND WE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. I'M ALSO HERE FOR CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION THEY WERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB -- EIGHTEEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT FEES AND TAXES THAT GUN OWNERS ALREADY DO YOU PAY. AS WAS MENTIONED THERE'S 11% FEDERAL EXCISE TAX. ON ON THE HELLO. FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION FOR CON -- CONSERVATION EFFORTS THROUGH THE PITTMAN ROBERTSON ACT -- THERE'S A NINETEEN DOLLAR GROSS THE WHICH WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT -- INCREASING JUST LATER ON TODAY OTHERSA ONE DOLLAR FIREARM SAFETY ACT BE THERE'S A FIVE DOLLAR FIREARM SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT THE END BEFORE YOU CAN. ACQUIRE ANY FIREARM THE STATE YOU NEED TO PAY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A FIREARM SAFETY CERTIFICATE OR AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH COULD BE -- A CERTIFICATE OF ELIGIBILITY OR CCW WHICH ARE EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FIVE YEAR FIREARMS SAFETY CERTIFICATE THE NOT TO MENTION STATE AND LOCAL TAXES -- WHEN IT COMES -- TO VIOLENCE PREVENTION THE COMMITTEE THIS SHOULD BE A MATTER OF GENERAL CONCERN FOR EVERYONE AND GUN OWNER SHOULD NOT BE SINGLED OUT TO PAY YET ANOTHER TAX. AND ANOTHER FEE -- TO FOR THE FOR THESE PROGRAMS WITHOUT WHEN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIAN AUTHORIZED. TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTS ONES COALITION -- AND CALIFORNIA'S SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY -- MEANT MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS READ THIS ISSUE MAY BE RESOLVED FOR US BY THE SUPREME COURT VERY SOON. THEY PRESENTLY OPENED UP A DOCKET. TO ACCEPT THE CASE JEREMY KEPLER VERSUS THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS TO DO WITH TAXATION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THIS TAX ABSOLUTELY -- IS A TAX ON THE EXERCISING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT NOW THIS CASE WILL NOT ONLY AFFECT THIS ONE BUT ALL OF THE OTHER -- TAXES THAT ARE ON AMMUNITION AND AND AND PARTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE GUNS. GUNS WORK -- THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE. CASES THAT HAVE SAID. YOU CANNOT TAX. THE EXERCISING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. PEOPLE SAY WELL WE TAX CARS WHILE DRIVING IS NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL BUT THE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION ARE NOT PROTECTED. BY THE CONSTITUTION -- THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE WILL SAY HEY WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAXES WELL THE THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD. BUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS A CONSTANT INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AND THAT PROTECTS THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACQUIRE TO USED TO TRANSPORT. TO TO TO HAVE WITH THEM TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS -- THIS IS EQUATED TO A VOTING TAX THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT'S BEEN HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND AND HERE YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO EXERCISE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT UNLESS YOU PAY A TAX. THAT IS PLAINLY. SIMPLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE GERMAN JEFFREY GOLDBERG FOR CALIFORNIA WATERFALL SO SEE ASIAN IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YES SIR. SENATE GRANTS YOUR PA IN A REMEMBER STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT WAS KAMLAGER-DOVE. HI A GOOD AFTERNOON SO I HAD A QUESTION -- I HAD A COUPLE ACTUALLY BUT THE FIRST ONE WAS WITH REGARDS TO THE CAL -- V. I. P. PROGRAM IT SAYS IN THE LANGUAGE THAT. THE GRAND SO WE MADE ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO CITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE. BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY FOR DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY GUN VIOLENCE SO CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE A I WOULD SORT OF WONDER HOW THIS. SHARE OF FUNDS WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED IF IT WOULD BE EQUITABLE. IF IT IS SHARED BASED ON THE KINDS OF VIOLENCE OR IS IT KINDS OF GUN VIOLENCE I MEAN SINCE IT'S A TAX ON GUNS I WOULD ASSUME ARE EXPECT THAT THERE'S SOME SORT OF CORRELATION. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. SO THIS PROGRAM IS UP THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE AN EXISTING PROGRAM STATUTES THIS EXISTING CALVET PROGRAM -- IT DOES A COMMUNITY VIOLENCE AND DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ABOUT BONDS HAS BEEN MEASURED AS HOMICIDES IN SHOOTINGS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF HOMICIDES ARE FATAL SHOOTINGS -- AND WE'D BE ABSOLUTELY HAPPY. TO TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY MORE EVEN MORE SPECIFIC LINK ON VIOLENCE -- IN PRACTICE THE PROGRAM THAT IS FUNDED ARE ABSOLUTELY TARGETED AT INTERRUPTING CYCLES OF SHOOTINGS AND RETALIATION -- AND I'D BE VERY HAPPY. TO TO WORK WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE AND COMMITTEE TO TO MAKE THAT EVEN CLEAR IN THE LANGUAGE THAT IS THE WAY IT'S WORKING IN PRACTICE AND THAT'S OUR INTENT OKAY. AND THEN THE TAXES FOR RETAILERS THE TAXES. THE AMENDED LANGUAGE RIGHT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME MISCOMMUNICATION BEFORE BUT THE AMENDED LANGUAGE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS A TAX ON ON RETAIL FIREARM SELLERS OF SAID THE SALE OF NEW FIREARMS. BY FIRING DEALERS OKAY AND MY ASSUMPTION WOULD BE THEY WOULD PASS IT DOWN AND THIS IS MY FINAL QUESTION -- MY CONCERN IS THAT THE RETAILERS OR ACT ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE RETAILERS OF PASSED THE TAX DOWN TO THE CONSUMER LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO. DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF THIS SORT OF DISCOURAGING FOLKS FROM PURCHASING IN THE LEGAL MARKET AND WANTING TO REVERT BACK TO PURCHASING IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET WHICH WE TEND TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT NOT WANTING TO HAVE. SORT OF TWO RESPONSES THE FIRST IS -- I ACTUALLY DO. I THINK SOME LIKELY WOULD PASSED THE THE CHARGE ON TO THEIR PURCHASERS BUT MANY WOULDN'T THIS IS A HIGHLY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY FOR A GUN SALES HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST DECADE -- AND MANY OF THESE ARE CORPORATIONS THAT JUST RECEIVED A BIG FEDERAL TAX CUT -- BUT SECOND I THINK THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR. FEE OF A NEW FIRE PURCHASES AB. I THINK YOU MEANT IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO REALLY SHIFT BEHAVIOR WHEN THE AVERAGE FIREARM COSTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR NEW FIREARMS -- THIS ALSO WOULDN'T APPLY TO NON SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS ARE MOST COMMONLY USED FOR HUNTING SO THIS IS NOT A PLAN TO USE FIREARMS THAT YOU'RE BUYING FROM ANOTHER UNLICENSED PERSON THROUGH A DEALER. SO. OUR THOUGHT IS THAT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT INTERESTED IN AND ENCOURAGING ANYONE TO GO TO THE LEGAL MARKET -- BUT WE THINK A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE FOR THESE REASONS IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO REALLY SHIFT BEHAVIOR MUCH SMALLER THAN ON AVERAGE THE FEDERAL MANUFACTURERS TAX. WHICH IS A 10211% ON USUALLY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THIS WOULD BE. SURE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF MARK ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND IT IS THERE A MOTION OR DO WE DO THAT ARI. OKAY. IS I SECOND THEM. OF BEACH CHAIRS ARE IS RECOMMENDED I IN A ACTUALLY A MY FRIEND FROM THE NRA ENOUGH FIREARMS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. WHAT HAPPENS WITH A COURT CASE AS FAR AS THE SECOND AMENDMENT BECAUSE I KNOW? BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT I KNOW I PAY TAXES ON MY NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND SO IF. AND I PAY A LOT FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT PUBLICATIONS SOFA. IF THEY REVOKED. ALL OF THAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW BECAUSE AGAIN I PAY A LOT. FOR A LOT OF PUBLICATIONS SO. JUDGE RECOMMENDED AYE. ON AB EIGHTEEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. CHEN SIR HI LACKEY LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAN. DEEP NO NO KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK SANTIAGO [inaudible] WICKS HI [inaudible] WICKS I ON CALL NEEDS TO MORE THANK YOU [inaudible] IN [inaudible] LOS [inaudible] THE AND YOU HAVE [inaudible] ANOTHER BILL. NINETEEN ONCE I CONSENT BUT FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE JUVENILE TRANSFERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK. AND WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS SOME USED TO BE TRIED IN THE ADULT CRIMINAL SYSTEM DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE. AT THE TIME OF THE OFFENSE AND THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE. JUVENILES ARE TRANSFERRED TO ADULT COURT THROUGH A TRANSFER HEARING PROCESS FOR THE PURPOSES OF A TRANSFER HEARING THE JUDGE ASSUMES THE CHARGES TO BE TRUE. IT IS RELATIVELY COMMON FOR INVESTIGATION AFTER TRANSFERRING TO REVEAL THAT THE CRIME THAT OCCURRED WAS NOT AS SERIOUS OR REGIONALLY AS ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. AND OCCASIONALLY THE YOUNG PERSON DID NOT COMMIT THE ALLEGATION THEY THEY ALLEGE OFFENSE AT ALL. UNDER CURRENT LAW ONCE A DECISION IS MADE TO TRANSFER THEY MAY NOT BE REFERRED BACK TO THE JUVENILE SYSTEM EVEN WHEN THE FELONY CHARGES THAT MADE THEM ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER ARE. OUR A AND PLAYED A ROLE IN THEIR TRANSFER ARTIST MR FOUND TO BE UNTRUE. THIS IS PATENTLY UNFAIR SITUATION. AB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE PROVIDES A NARROWLY TAILORED REMEDY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY ESTABLISHING A PROCESS FOR A JUVENILE TO REQUEST THE CRIMINAL COURT TO TRANSFER CASE TO JUVENILE COURT IN A LIMITED NUMBER OF SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE BASIS FOR THE ORIGINAL TRANSFER IS LATER DETERMINED TO BE INVALID. THIS BILL PROVIDES A MUCH NEEDED MECHANISM TO ASSURE FAIRNESS AND ALLOW USED TO RECEIVE THE RESOURCES AND SERVICES THEY NEED FOR REHABILITATION IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. OPPOSITION TO THE BILL NOTED CONCERNS REGARDING SITUATIONS THAT INCLUDE PLEA BARGAINING WE ARE TAKING COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY. AND THE CASE WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN PLEA AGREEMENTS. A JUVENILE MAY BE TRANSFERRED BACK TO JUVENILE COURT WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR. WE WE ARE OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS ANY CONTINUING CONCERNS. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE PACIFIC ALL PACIFIC JUVENILE DEFENDER CENTER AND INTRODUCE OUR WITNESS SUPER I'LL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE AYE VOTE OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MOVE THE BILL. SECOND. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS BILL DOES ADDRESS A VERY NARROW GAP THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BY THE COURT OF APPEAL IN. THE CASE OF PEOPLE VERSUS SELF. AND THE COURT OF APPEALS SAID THAT THEY HAD NO ABILITY TO TRANSFER CASE BACK TO JUVENILE COURT WHEN THE YOUNG PERSON WAS CONVICTED OF A LESSER OFFENSE. AND THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT SO HERE WE ARE TWENTY YEARS LATER. BUT BETTER LATE THAN NEVER -- WHAT HAPPENS -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS HAS SAID IS THAT SOMETIMES WHEN THE IN THE TRANSFER HEARING THE COURT IS USING THE ARREST REPORT AS THE BASIS FOR DECIDING TRANSFER. AND EVEN THOUGH THE COURT LOOKS AT A SERIES OF FACTORS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCE WEIGHS HEAVILY IN THE DECISION WHETHER TO DETERMINE THAT A YOUNG PERSON CANNOT BE REHABILITATED IN THE ADULT SYSTEM. SO -- SO AND SO WHAT HAPPENS AND WHEN THE CASE GETS TO ADULT COURT AND THERE'S TIME TO INVESTIGATE AND TALK TO WITNESSES. AND THE YOUNG PERSON IS CONVICTED OF SOMETHING LESS THERE'S NO WAY TO GET THE YOUNG PERSON. BACK TO JUVENILE COURT AND SO AB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE PROVIDES FOR THREE SPECIFIC SITUATIONS ONE IS WHERE. THE YOUNG PERSON GOES TO ADULT COURT AND IS CONVICTED ONLY OF MISDEMEANORS. AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN BE ELIGIBLE FOR TRANSFER ON MISDEMEANORS SO THAT ONE IS EASY. THE SECOND ONE IS WHERE THE YOUNG PERSON GOES TO ADULT COURT AND IS CONVICTED STILL OF A FELONY BUT A MUCH LESS SERIOUS FELONY. THAN THAN THE FRANCE FOR DECISION WAS PREMISED ON AND IN THAT CASE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE COURT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE RECORD OF THE TRANSFER HEARING. AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE OFFENSE WAS SERIOUSLY A FACTOR IN THE DECISION TO TRANSFER THE YOUNG PERSON THE COURT HAS THE ABILITY IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE TO TRANSFER THE CASE BACK. TO JUVENILE COURT FOR DISPOSITION. THE THIRTY SITUATION IS THE ONE THAT I THINK IS WHAT -- PERCOLATED THE INTEREST OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ANDTHAT'S IN THE CASE OF PLEA BARGAINS. AND WE THINK THAT THEY HAVE A LEGITIMATE POINT THAT A PLEA BARGAIN TO A LESSER OFFENSE COULD BE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS OTHER THAN JUST THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENSE. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE AMENDMENTS IS TO REQUIRE THAT THE COURT MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT THE CASE IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE SHOULD GO BACK. BUT ALSO REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF THE PROSECUTOR AND WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT. OVER 90% OF CASES ARE RESOLVED BY PLEA BARGAINS THIS GIVES THE PROSECUTOR AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POWER. THIS BILL CAME -- TO BECAME TO YOU BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF PUBLIC DEFENDERS AROUND THE STATE WHOSE YOUNG CLIENTS ARE CONVICTED OF A LESSER OFFENSE AND WIND UP. GOING TO COUNTY JAIL WHERE THEY GET NO EDUCATION NO REHABILITATED SERVICES OR MAY EVEN BE AN UNSUPERVISED PROBATION IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS A BAD SITUATION FOR THEM AND IT'S BAD FOR THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

BUT I'D CHARACTERIZE IT IS SOFT. WHICH MADE A BIG SHE MAY BIG CONCESSION [inaudible] YES. ANY QUESTIONS YEAH JUST A CLARIFICATION WITH THESE CONVICTIONS. SUCH ROOM SET BACK TO THE JUVENILE SYSTEM FALL UNDER THE JUVENILE STANDARD AND BE AN EDUCATION FOUND TRUE AND NOT A A CONVICTION. SO THEREFORE NOT BE USED AS A FIREBALL OFFENSE.

ON AB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GEN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING BAUER-KAHAN DEEP. DEEP NOT VOTING KAMLAGER-DOVE HI KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK SANTIAGO. WICKS HI WICKS I MEASURES ARE CALLED NEEDS TO MORE THANK YOU [inaudible] NOW MISS [inaudible] CRISTINA [inaudible] GARCIA [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FOR COMPETING WITH WATER PARKS AND WILDLIFE FOR THE LONG IS HEARING TODAY [inaudible] THE LAND. JUST WRAPPED UP OVER THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF ARE WORKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON FURTHER CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AND LATER POLICY IN FISCAL COMMITTEES. AB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE ENSURES THAT THE EXPERIENCE THE NEEDS OF CRIME SURVIVORS IS AT THE CENTER OF THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION POLICY. CRIME SURVEY WERE STILL UP CALIFORNIA DESERVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES COMPENSATION AS WELL AS A JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT PRIOR TO HIS PREVENTION SCRIBBLE TATIAN AND RECOVERY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WILL LIMIT MY COMMENTS AND ALLOW OUR EXPERTS HERE TO GIVE YOU SOME MORE DETAILS AND TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANDRE PERRY AND ON THE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AS WELL AS CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. AND WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WE HAVE COME TO THE CAPITAL DAY WITH OVER SIX HUNDRED SURVIVORS WE HAVE MET WITH ALL OF YOUR OFFICES WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS FROM EVERYONE WHO HAS COME UP -- OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS -- WE ECHO THE AUTHORS SENTIMENTS -- AND WE THINK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR WORKING ON AB FOURTEEN FORTY NINE WITH US. BY REMOVING THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT THIS BILL EXPANDS ACCESS AND ELIMINATES ON AN UNFAIR AND BERGESEN BARRIER THAT PREVENTS SURVIVORS FROM ACCESSING THE SUPPORT THEY ARE TOUGH ENTITLED TO UNDER THE LAW. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIANS VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD MUST DENY COMPENSATION IF THE SURVIVOR DOES NOT COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOW THE C. B. CAN USE OTHER EVIDENCE FROM MEDICAL? PROVIDERS MEDICAL REPORTS OR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO VERIFY THAT A CRIME OCCURRED FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING OFFENSES BUT NOT FOR OTHER CRIMES. THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMIZATION SURVEY FOUND THAT IT FOUND ONLY 45% OF VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION IS OUR WERE OVER REPORTED TO POLICE. CAL THE C. B. AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ANNUAL REPORT TO THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF VICTIMS OF CRIME STATES THAT FAILURE TO REPORT OFFENSES. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE MOST COMMON REASON. FOR CLAIM TO NILES AND THAT'S NEARLY A THOUSAND SURVIVORS THE COMPENSATION THAT'S PROVIDED ARE FOR VICTIMS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE MEDICAL CARE RELOCATION COSTS AND OTHER COSTS THAT SURVIVORS CAN REALLY FOCUS ON HEALING. WE THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA FOR RECOGNIZING THE VOICES OF SURVIVORS HAVE BEEN SILENT FOR TOO LONG AND NOW IS THE TIME TO PUSH A REAL HONEST NARRATIVE FROM THE SURVIVORS IN CALIFORNIA. I RELINQUISH THE REST OF MY TIME TO A SURVIVOR [inaudible] NINETEEN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TO NEEDS HOLLINS I AM THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR CRIMES VIRUS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. ARE PRESENT AND NETWORK OF CRIME SURVIVORS HERE IN STATE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS. OR DIVERSE EXPERIENCES AS SURVIVORS AND I MYSELF AM ALSO CRIME SURVIVOR I LOST TWO BROTHERS TO HOMICIDE -- IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE CRIME SURVIVOR VOICES REALLY DO NEED TO INFORM OUR POLICY DECISIONS. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO POLICIES THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT US. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY CRIME SURVIVORS DO NOT REPORT CRIMES TO THE POLICE AS SOMETIMES THERE ISSUES AROUND SAFETY -- RETALIATION REPRISED -- ACCESS -- THE PROCESS OF ACTUALLY GETTING A POLICE REPORT FILED CAN SOMETIMES PRESENT OF BARRIERS AND SAFETY ISSUES FOR CRIME SURVIVORS AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE SO. OF CRIME SURVIVORS INTERACT WITH A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS IN THEIR PROCESS. IN RESPONSE TO A CRIME SOCIAL WORKERS. DOCTORS -- MEDICAL PROVIDERS CASE MANAGERS ALL OF THOSE FOLKS SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE VIRUS TO THE PROCESS OF GETTING ACCESS IT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE RESTRICTED. TO ONLY GETTING A POLICE REPORT TO BE ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE AN INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO THEM. WE ARE BRINGING OUR VOICES -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE WE WANT TO ROUTE TO LIMIT -- RESTRICTIONS TO ACCESS FOR HEALING HEALING IS AT THE CENTER. OF REDUCING CRIME IN REDUCING HARM IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS TO ACCESSING THOSE SERVICES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

EIGHT THE DOOR DOESN'T OPEN. THE BIG DOOR. WHEN EVER YOU'RE READY MISS MELENDEZ THANK YOU? COULD YOU CLOSE THE DOOR PLEASE SERGEANTS. NOISY DAY I'M SORRY. I'M WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE BILL I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD A REALLY QUITE NONE OF THAT AND MORNING SO I'M HERE TO SPICE THINGS UP FOR YOU. KIDDING. SWISS LAUGHED THAT. THIS WENT AS WE USE MOVE THE MY CLOSER I SURE I THINK IT PERHAPS IF THEY CAN GET THAT DOOR CLOSE IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR ME -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO CLEAN UP CALIFORNIA'S NEW TIERED SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. THE NEW TIERED SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY ASSIGNS DIFFERENT REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS BASED UPON THE OFFENSE COMMITTED IN THE AGE OF THE VICTIM IT WAS DESIGNED TO RELIEVE CERTAIN OFFENSES LIKE INDECENT EXPOSURE. OUT FROM REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. BETTER LESS HARSH THAN SOME OF THE MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES THAT ARE COMMITTED. UNFORTUNATELY THIS NEW TIERED SYSTEM HAS A HORRIBLE INCONSISTENCY AND THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS OFFENSES UNDER THIS NEW TIERED SYSTEM MOLESTING A CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN IS DEAN THE TIER TWO OFFENSE. WHICH MEANS YOU MUST REGISTER FOR ONLY TWENTY YEARS THE EXACT SAME OFFENCE OF MOLESTING A CHILD WHERE THE VICTIM IS FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE. IS TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY AND IS PLACED AS A TIER THREE OFFENSE A LIFETIME OF REGISTRY. IN ADDITION TO THIS DISCREPANCY IT IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING THAT THE TIERED SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE RECIDIVISM RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OFFENSE. RESEARCHERS WIDELY AGREED THAT RECIDIVISM RATES UNDER ESTIMATE THE TRUE RECIDIVISM RATES RECEIPT EXCUSE ME RECIDIVISM RATES OF SEX OFFENDERS AND IS ALSO EQUALLY TROUBLING. THAT RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED. TO WILL CONTRIBUTE TO WHICH TEAR AND OFFENDER IS A SIGN. I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THE JOHN GARDNER CASE WHO WAS GIVEN A LOW SCORE OF TWO AFTER MOLESTING A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL AND AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON JOHN GARDNER WENT ON TO A DOCKED. RAPE AND MURDER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD AMBER DO WHAT AND THEN CAPTURE RAPE AND MURDER SEVEN CHERYL CHART CHELSEA KING. THIS IS WHY WE CANNOT TRUST RISK ASSESSMENTS WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE WARY OF EMBRACING RISK ASSESSMENTS AS THE MAIN DETERMINANT. FOR HOW LONG A SEX OFFENDER MUST REMAIN ON THE DATABASE THIS TIERED SYSTEM WAS CREATED TO ESTABLISH EQUITY FOR THE PERPETRATORS THE SYSTEM HOWEVER ESTABLISHES NO EQUITY FOR THE VICTIMS -- BY REQUIRING ONLY TWENTY YEARS REGISTRATION FROM MOLESTING YOUNG CHILDREN WE ARE FORGETTING ABOUT THE CHELSEA KINGS IN THE AMBER DO WISE OF THE WORLD. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT BY REQUIRING LIFETIME REGISTRATION AS A SEX OFFENDER FOR THOSE WHO MOLESTED UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S. ASSOCIATION AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY -- IS CATHERINE DELAY TREE WHO IS WITH THE CULT CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS [inaudible] YES MA'AM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS KATHERINE TO LET FROM CALIFORNIA. PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR CO FOUNDER CONNIE VALENTINE. WITH THE FOCUS ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE IN THE ME TOO MOVEMENT WE ARE REMINDED THAT SEXUAL ABUSE OF ANY SORT IS UNACCEPTABLE. WHEN IT IS PERPETRATED AGAINST CHILDREN IT IS A GROTESQUE LIFE DESTROYING CRIME? RAPE CRISIS NETWORK REPORTS THAT THE YOUNGER THE CHILD THE WORSE THE ABUSE THE MORE LIKELY THE CHILD IS TO SUFFER ADDITIONAL ABUSE. AND THE ABUSES PERPETRATED FOR LONGER TIME. CHILDREN ARE SITTING DUCKS FOR SEXUAL PREDATORS 25240% OF GIRLS ARE MOLESTED IN THE U. S. 16230% OF BOYS ARE MOLESTED IN THE U. S.. CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ARE FOUR TO TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SEXUALLY ABUSED HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS BLUNTLY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT PETA FILES. THE JULY TWENTY TEN HARVARD HEALTH NEWSLETTER STATES THAT RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. FOR PEDOPHILE YEAH. THERE IS NO CURE SO THE FOCUS IS ON PROTECTING CHILDREN STATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE MEGAN'S LAW AND THE ADAM WALSH ACT SEEK TO LIMIT WHERE CONVICTED. CONVICTED SEX CRIME OFFENDERS MAY LIVE AND WORK THESE PROGRAMS ALERT THE COMMUNITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO POTENTIAL SUSPECTS. THERE IS IN EQUITY IN THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA STATUTE REGARDING THE TIERED SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY MEGAN'S LAST WHEN A PERPETRATOR IS CONVICTED OF A LEWD OR LASCIVIOUS CRIME AGAINST A CHILD. IF THE CHILD IS AGE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN THE CONVICTED OFFENDER MUST REGISTER FOR LIFE ON MEGAN'S LIST. BUT IN THE SAME CRIME IF THE SAME CRIME IS PERPETRATED ON A CHILD FOURTEEN YEARS ARE UNDER THAT DEFENDER ONLY NEEDS TO REGISTER FOR TWENTY YEARS. THIS INEQUITY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SINCE IT PROVIDES A HUGE LOOPHOLE. FOR PETA FILES AND REDUCES PROTECTION FOR POTENTIAL CHILD VICTIMS AB EIGHT EIGHT FOUR WOULD RECTIFY THE DISPARITY IN SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION WHILE ENSURING CHILDREN FOURTEEN YEARS AND UNDER ARE PROTECTED. FROM FURTHER PREDATION CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. EIGHT EIGHT FOUR THANK YOU MA'AM. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR WRITING SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WHAT WHAT RUN HERE? LET THEM TESTIFY FIRST AND THEN. WHAT DO TO ME? TOO YES. I AM WE ARE TRACKING CONSULTING PSYCHOLOGISTS AND BOARD COORDINATOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD.

COUNTY AND CITY ADMINISTRATORS. THE BOARD OPPOSES AB. EIGHT EIGHT FOUR THE BOARD WAS THE LEAD SPONSOR OF SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH CHANGE LIFETIME REGISTRATION TO A TIERED SYSTEM. SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR IS BASED ON CURRENT AND RELIABLE RESEARCH ON SEXUAL OFFENDER RECIDIVISM RATES AND SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. RESEARCH INFORMS US THE LONGER A SEX OFFENDERS IN THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT COMMITTING A CRIME THE LESS LIKELY THEY ARE TO COMMIT A NEW OFFENSE. HIGHLIGHTING THAT IF AN AVERAGE RISK SEX OFFENDER IS IN THE COMMUNITY FOR TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT COMMITTING AN OFFENSE. THERE AT NO GREATER RISK THAN SOMEONE IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO COMMIT ANY OF SEXUAL OFFENSE. SB THREE FOUR CREATED A MECHANISM FOR ADDRESSING HIGHER RISK OFFENDERS WHO COMMIT PC. TO EIGHTY EIGHT EIGHT INDIVIDUALS ASSESS TO BE IT WELL ABOVE AVERAGE RISK OF RE OFFENDING ON THE STATIC NINETY NINE OUR RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE PLACED ON TIER. THREE OR IF THE CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER COMMITS ANOTHER SEX CRIME UNDER REGISTRATION HERE SHE WILL BE MOVED FROM TIER TWO TO TIER. THREE THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOON TO BE ENACTED TIERED REGISTRATION SYSTEM IS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE ARE PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY. AND USERS RESEARCH AND PRACTICE TO BUILD THE MOST BALANCED MONITORING OF CONVICTED SEX OFFENDERS. THANK YOU NEXT -- BARCO GEORGE -- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AND YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD WAS CREATED OUT OF CDC R. TASKFORCE. WHICH ARE BROUGHT TOGETHER PAROLE OFFICERS PROBATION OFFICERS LAW ENFORCEMENT. ON TO PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS EITHER PSYCHOLOGIST OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND BAD -- OUT OF THAT. CALIFORNIA CDC YOUR TASKFORCE GREW. AND WAS MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE CALIFORNIA SEX OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD. AND THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY TASKED WITH COMING UP WITH HOW TO MANAGE SEX OFFENDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND BAD IS THE BOARD. OF THAT MY COLLEAGUE AS PART OF AND SHE IS A PSYCHOLOGIST ON THE BOARD AND YOU KNOW PROBABLY ALREADY THAT THE BOARD IS HEADED BY NANCY O'MALLEY IS THE CHAIR. WHO IS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF ALAMEDA COUNTY? THE LEGISLATION THAT A.. EIGHT EIGHT FOUR SIX TO RE. IS LEGISLATION THAT WAS BROUGHT BY THE CALIFORNIA SEXISM OFFENDER MANAGEMENT BOARD BECAUSE AFTER STUDYING THE PROBLEM AND THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THE FEW STATES IN THE COUNTRY. THAT HAVE LIFETIME REGISTRATION FOR EVERYONE -- IT WAS JUST AND MANAGEABLE. IT WAS SO BIG IT WAS NOT PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY SO THEY STUDY THE PROBLEM. AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE EMBODIED WITH IN SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR WHICH WAS PASSED TWO YEARS AGO. BY MANY OF YOU WERE SITTING HERE TODAY -- IN ANY EVENT THAT WAS FOUNDED AND A ROSE OUT OF THE VERY ROBUST BODY OF SOCIAL SCIENCE EVIDENCE. AND THE REASON THAT -- PEOPLE CHARGE WITH CHILD MOLESTATION LEWD BEHAVIOR ON CHILDREN WERE MOVED FROM LIFETIME REGISTRATION TO TWENTY YEARS WAS BECAUSE THEY HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST. RATES OF RE OFFENSE OF SEXUAL RE OFFENSE. 86% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEVER RE OFFEND -- AND WHETHER OR AND THAT THEIR EVALUATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DYNAMIC AND STATIC RISK FACTORS. I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. TO UNDER CUT THIS VERY SOUND POLICY THAT WAS ENACTED BY THIS BODY JUST TWO YEARS AGO. AND HAS NOT YET EVEN BEEN IMPLEMENTED SO FOR THOSE REASONS WAS RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SO POOR IN OPPOSITION OF TARTAN OPPOSITION.

ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SO THE AVERAGE -- CHILD MOLESTER OFFENDS. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE THEY EVER CAUGHT IF THEY'RE CAUGHT. IF THEY'RE CAUGHT. ACCORDING TO FBI STATISTICS ONLY ONE OUT OF EVERY TEN BY THEIR ESTIMATES ONLY ONE OUT OF EVERY. TEN IS EVEN REPORTED. SO THE SUGGESTION THAT. 86% NEVER RE OFFEND. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT STATISTIC CAME FROM BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW ANYBODY COULD POSSIBLY KNOW THAT. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT CHILDREN'S LIVES ARE RUINED WHEN THIS HAPPENS? WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT THAT HAS ON THE OFFENDER AND THE OFFENDER'S FAMILY AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT MUST BE. SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AS YOU TRY TO MOVE THROUGH YOUR LIFE. BUT WE SET CERTAIN PARAMETERS ON SOCIETY AND HOW WE EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE HAD. IN THEIR FREEDOM. THIS BILL DOESN'T THROW OUT THE LAW WHOLESALE ONLY CHANGES ONE PORTION OF IT JUST ONE PORTION. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE BUT IF YOU MOLEST A CHILD. FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THAT YOUR PUNISHMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN IF THE CHILD IS UNDER FOURTEEN IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME SO. THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT THIS IN THE WAY YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS TO FRANKLY IS. THIS MEANS THAT. PARENTS GRANDPARENTS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ARE ABLE TO NOW. WHO HAS SOMETHING IN THEIR PAST? THAT WOULD WARRANTED THEM TO BE A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUS AROUND THAT PERSON. THAT MEANS THAT. IF YOU KNOW THAT THE NICE MAN THAT LIVES DOWN THE STREET FROM YOU WHO'S A SENIOR CITIZEN WHO'S RETIRED WHO'S ALWAYS OUT WALKING HIS DOG IN SEEMS FRIENDLY ENOUGH. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW. IF HE HAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN HIS PAST BEFORE YOU ASK HIM TO BABY SIT. YOUR TWO YEAR OLD TODDLER WHO CAN'T TALK AND CAN'T COMMUNICATE TO YOU WHAT HE MAY. BE DOING TO HER WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND. WE ALL KNOW CHILD MOLESTERS ARE NOT LIKE SOMEBODY IN A DARK TRENCH COAT WITH GLASSES AND A HAT ON HIDING IN THE CORNER. MOST OF THE TIMES IT'S SOMEONE ALMOST ALL OF THE TIME IT'S SOMEONE THAT THEY NOW IT IS NOT A STRANGER IT'S SOMEONE WHO DEVELOPS A REPORT A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT CHILD. THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE SO GOOD AT IT AND THEY'RE SO MANIPULATIVE INTO GETTING PEOPLE TO THINK THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY SAFE AND WHAT I AM SAYING IS I'M NOT ASKING. THAT THEY ARE THROWN BEHIND BARS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THEIR LIVES AND BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS AND NO ONE'S GOING TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT. BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ALL AWARE. OF THE SITUATION AND MAKE OUR OWN DETERMINATION I'M NOT I'M NOT SAYING. THEY SHOULD BE JUDGED FOR ETERNITY I'M SAYING WE SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MART CHOICES FOR OUR OWN CHILDREN I'M ASKING FOR ONE SECTION OF THIS. TO BE CHANGED THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING. FOR WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- I KNOW THIS IS A PASSIONATE. CONCERN OF YOURS AND SO -- I KNOW I'M ASKING. WE HAVE A RISK ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENT IT FAIRLY SOON. AND DAY THE THE PREMISE THE NOVICES ARE VERY SENSITIVE. ABOUT RISK ASSESSMENT. AND TO JUST THROW OUT RISK ASSESSMENT ALTOGETHER WHEN IT PROBABLY WILL BE [inaudible] BASED. PRIMARILY ON WHAT WE DO WITH BAIL LETTING PEOPLE OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT. SO. ONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE'VE. THOSE OF US THAT WORK REAL HARD FOR TWO TIERED SYSTEM TO GET IN PLACE AND YOU WERE HERE AND I WERE HERE HOW HARD IT WAS EVEN JUST. TO GET THAT VOTED IN THE WEEKLY SLATED GET IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE OF THEIR A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK SOME VERY VERY VERY TOUGH VOTE. ON IT ISSUE -- TO TO HAVE THAT EVEN START SO LET'S GET THAT STARTED. AND THEN IS BEFORE WE START WATERING IT DOWN. THAT'S ONE TO LET'S SEE HOW THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND OTHER TOOLS ARE BEING USED TO ASSESS THESE INDIVIDUALS TO SEE IF IT ACTUALLY WORKS AND MAKE THINGS BETTER SO WE DON'T. SO WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T PUT. ANYONE AT RISK NO MATTER WHAT AGE. AND SO WITH THAT -- THE CHURCH RECOMMEND NO VOTE [inaudible] SECOND. ON AB EIGHT FOUR THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. JONES SAWYER. CHEN SERRANO LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE HAVE NO KAMLAGER-DOVE NO QUIRK SANTIAGO [inaudible] WICKS. MEASURES ON CALL NEEDS TO MARK. AND YOU HAVE YOUR OTHER BILL. I DO I HAVE AB [inaudible] ONE FIVE FIVE NINE AND LOOKING FOR MY WITNESS. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN HERE SO YEAH THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE -- IT RYAN SHERMAN IS STILL IN THE ROOM. GOOD INDIAN RE OKAY PERFECT PERFECT OKAY. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN. A LETTER YOU WROTE MOST OF THEM. I KNOW WHY I DIDN'T KNOW I BROUGHT MOST OF THEM. TURNS OUT I KNOW HOW TO THROW A PARTY SOUTH. OKAY. SO -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHILE EVERYONE IS GETTING SETTLED I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB ONE FIVE FIVE NINE ON THIS IS A BILL ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHICH IS YOUR FAVORITE AMENDMENT I KNOW. I'M SO I HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY MY PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU TODAY NOT ONLY UPHOLD THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT IT PROTECTS THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND THE MOST IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES NOW MORE THAN EVER. CALIFORNIANS HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN VIOLENT THREATS IN VIOLENT CRIMES THE MOST RECENT CRIME DATA REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SHOWS. THAT OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED CALLS ARE MADE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH IS A 3% INCREASE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE AMOUNT OF RAPE CASES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NEARLY DOUBLED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THESE VICTIMS CANNOT PROTECT THEMSELVES BECAUSE A BIG GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. CALIFORNIA LAW STATES THAT IN ORDER FOR A PERSON TO RECEIVE A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT THE CAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MUST PROMPTLY FURNISH A BACKGROUND CHECK INSTEAD THE LICENSING AUTHORITY A REPORT OF THE DATA. RIGHT NOW THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO APPLY FOR CCW WAIT MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS I'M ON THE STATUS OF THEIR PERMIT BECAUSE DOJ TAKES SO LONG TO PROCESS THEIR COME THERE -- THEY'RE FILING SOME SHARES IN POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE ALSO ALLOWED A PERMIT APPLICATIONS TO OVERFLOW I KNOW THAT HAPPENED IN MY OWN COUNTY WORK COUNTY SHERIFF. ALLOWED THESE APPLICATIONS A PILOT FOR FOR TWO YEARS AND PEOPLE HAD TO WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT ALLOW BUREAUCRACY TO STAND IN BETWEEN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE IN THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES THIS BILL MEERS WHAT OTHER STATES DO. ALLOWS A PERSON HE REASONABLY BELIEVES THAT THEY'RE IN DANGER OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR STOCKING TO APPLY FOR A THIRTY DAY TEMPORARY CONCEALED CARRY EMERGENCY LICENSE. AFTER SATISFYING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ORDINARILY I HAVE TO BE MET FOR CCW THERE IS NO SPECIAL PASSED GIVEN HERE IT'S JUST SAYING IT WILL BE EXPEDITED. I DON'T BELIEVE AND I DON'T I HOPE YOU DON'T EITHER THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STAND IN THE WAY THE DEMS PROTECTING THEMSELVES SO WITH ME TODAY IS RAIN SHERMAN FROM THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION INDIAN READ FROM YOUR FAVORITE ORGANIZATION THE NRA. THANK YOU. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION -- ARE RIVERSIDE COUNTIES AS SENSUALLY THE SIZE OF NEW JERSEY AND WE'RE VERY SPARSELY POPULATED IN A LOT OF AREAS. AND LOTS OF FOLKS ARE IN DESPERATE NEED OF BEING ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF. OUT IN THESE FRINGE PARTS OF THE COUNTY. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL ALLOW SPECIFIED IN DANGER PERSONS TO BE BETTER POSITIONED. TO PROTECT. THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES BY ALLOWING THEM TO APPLY. FOR EMERGENCY CCW UNDER LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BILL ALLOWS THEM TO APPLY FOR IT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT THEY ACTUALLY BE ISSUED. ONE SO IF THEY DON'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL THEY WOULD NOT END UP GETTING THE PERMIT -- THE RESEARCHER ASSOCIATION IS. PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE THINK IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO IMPROVED. SAFETY FOR THE PERSONS THAT ARE BEING STOCKED OR ARE POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WE THINK IT IS A GOOD WAY FOR PEOPLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WHEN THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT AROUND. AND WE ARE JR YES VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATURAL FORCES YOU SHOULD ALSO DOING ME TOO FOR CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL TODAY. WE WANT TO THINK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FOR BRINGING THIS GREAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THAT WILL HELP THOSE WHO ARE IN IN GREAT DANGER OF OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL SOLDIER STOCKING SITUATIONS -- AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE AT EVERY TIME. AND SOMETIMES A RESTRAINING ORDER IS JUST NOT ENOUGH TO PROTECT THEM FROM WOULD BE AGGRESSORS AND ATTACKERS. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES A CLEAR PATH. FOR EMERGENCY AND EXPEDITED CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS ALL THE SAME LAWS ARE GOING TO APPLY OTHER THAN YOU HAVE THE EMERGENCY PERMIT -- LAW ENFORCEMENTCAN'T CHECK TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT PROHIBITED AND WE KNOW THAT THEY THERE IS A MECHANISM FOR THE THAT TO DO ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY BY THE OP SYSTEM AS WELL AS THE AS HE LEADS SYSTEM I BELIEVE IS WHAT'S. IN THIS BILL WE'RE GONNA SEE THAT AYE AMMUNITION COMING UP HERE IN A FEW MONTHS -- SO RIGHT NOW CONCEALED CARRY PERMITS IN ORDER TO JUST GETTING A PERMIT TO OUR AN APPLICATION TO APPLY CAN TAKE WEEKS MONTHS AND IN SOME CASES ALL YEARS -- WHICH IS JUST NOT CUTTING IT AND SO THIS PROVIDES A CLEAR PATH NO RIGHT NOW IN EXISTING LAW THERE IS AN EXEMPTION. FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ENGRAVER IMMEDIATE DANGER TO CARRY A CONCEALED FIREARM. HOWEVER THAT'S THAT'S TREATED MORE AS AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE SO IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEONE FEELS THAT THEY'RE IN. I MEDIA OR GRAVE DANGER AND THEY'RE CARRYING A CONCEALED FIREARM THAT'S KIND OF AN EVOLVING SITUATION COULD BE OPEN TO INTERPRETATION AND IT COULD COST. US SOMEONE WHO DOES FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE I TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES PLEADING THIS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL I THINK IT'S GONNA GO A LONG WAY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN AGAIN FOR BRINGING IT. THANK YOU. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THIS GERMAN MEMBER SAMPRAS REPRESENTING DOLLARS CALIFORNIA AND THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. DEMOCRATS CRP AND ARE A MEMBER STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN. SUPPORT. YES MA'AM. CATHERINE TO LET SURVIVOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

FOR THOSE OP FACING POSSIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT OR STALKING I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE LIGHT OF THAT -- HOWEVER I DO FIND THIS BILL TROUBLING. BY MY READING OF THE BILL -- A SHARE FOOT ESSENTIALLY BE REQUIRED TO ISSUE IN AND IMMEDIATELY AN EMERGENCY LICENSE THE BILL SAYS THAT THEY MAY. DOESN'T SAY SHALL. OUR CONDUCTOR BACKGROUND CHECKS NO TRAINING IS REQUIRED IN AS A RESOLVE. THERE ARE A BE A PERSON WHO IS AFRAID. ON TRAIN CARRYING -- A LOT OF FIREMAN PUBLIC I THINK THAT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE. THAT -- TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OUR PREVENTION. COALITION MEMBER ORGANIZATION IS IN SUPPORT OF THAT BILL -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FINDING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THERE HAS BEEN A PUSH BY THE GUN LOBBY. TO ARM TO MISSED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS WITH THESE EMERGENCY ORDERS ARE THERE BEEN MANY STATEMENTS BY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESEARCHERS AND EXPERTS -- STATING THAT -- HOW AND WHY IS THAT IS THAT IF YOU PUT FIREARMS IN THE HANDS OF UNTRAINED AFRAID PERSON THAT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER SOMEONE IS LIKELY BE HURT -- THE POTENTIAL EFFECT -- THE OFFENDER -- OR CHILDREN INVOLVED [inaudible] LEAVING. YOU'RE KIDDING. I DO NOT HAVE A ISSUE WITH -- AND EXPLICATED EXPEDITED PROCESS FOR CCW BY THINK DIMMER EMERGENCY -- OUR PERMIT IS UNWISE AND PUTS. THE FAMILY MEMBERS THE POTENTIAL VICTIM AND THE PUBLIC ADDRESS. AT ASKS FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] OKAY. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAKE. CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBER LACKEY HE WAS STILL WITH US -- I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT -- WERE STATED BY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE. THAT THE PERMIT IS ISSUED NO WE'RE IN THE BILL DOES IT SAY THAT IS REQUIRED THAT IS I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE'S READING BUT IT'S NOT MY BILL -- AND I TAKE. A LITTLE BIT OF ISSUE WITH HER WHEN IT SEEMS LIKE A SUGGESTION THAT A GUN GROUP -- THIS IS AGAIN GROUPS BILL THIS WAS ACTUALLY MY IDEA AND MY BILL -- AND AS YOU RECALL NOT SO LONG AGO ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR I SHARED WITH YOU IN THE REST OF MY COLLEAGUES THE STORY. OF MY OWN MOTHER. WHEN SHE WAS GOING THROUGH A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE WHEN I WAS A YOUNG CHILD AND HER NEED? TO BORROW A WEAPON FROM SOMEONE WHICH ULTIMATELY SAVED HER LIFE SHE ENOUGH TO FIRE THAT WEAPON BUT THAT WEAPON ULTIMATELY SAVED HER LIFE THAT IS WHERE THE IDEA FROM THIS FOR THIS BILL COMES FROM. BY MIDNIGHT THIS EVENING THREE WOMEN JUSTIN SIGNO GO CAN SEEN DIEGO COUNTY ALONE WE'LL BE RIGHT. THAT'S THE AVERAGE EVERYDAY AT LEAST THREE WOMEN EVERY DAY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WILL BE RIGHT THREE WOMEN WILL BE [inaudible] BRUTALLY ASSAULTED. IN FRONT OF PERHAPS THEIR CHILDREN. THREE WOMEN WILL HAVE THEIR DIGNITY STRIPPED FROM THEM. THEIR SAFETY AND SECURITY GONE FOREVER IN YEARS AND YEARS OF EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED AND COUNSELING AND INABILITY TO INTERACT WITH HER HUSBAND OR SPOUSE OR PARTNER IN IN WAYS THAT TO THE REST OF US MIGHT SEEM NORMAL. IN. BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT [inaudible] SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERYBODY. BELIEVES THAT GUN OWNERSHIP IS IS THE ANSWER RIGHT I CAN RESPECT THAT. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY THAT'S NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE WEAPON HAVE ONE FRANKLY BECAUSE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BUT I DO WANT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES YOU HAVE IMMEDIATE DANGER TO AT LEAST HAVE THE CHANCE. TO SAVE THEIR OWN LIFE. RATHER THAN HAVE A COMMITTEE OF LEGISLATORS TELL THEM NO WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT OPTION FOR YOU. I GUESS THEY CAN JUST CALL THE POLICE AND WAIT. OR MAYBE THEY WON'T CALL THE POLICE BECAUSE MAYBE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BECAUSE BY THEN WILL BE TOO LATE. THIS THIS IS A VERY REASONABLE BILL. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN GREAT DANGER. WHAT HOW HOW ELSE I'M FIVE FOOT? TWO HOW DO I DEFEND MYSELF AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO'S SIX FOOT TWO AND WEIGHS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS HE'S BIGGER THAN ME HE'S STRONGER THAN ME. HOW DO I PROTECT MYSELF FROM SOMEONE LIKE THAT? IF I KNOW THAT HE'S STALKING ME IF I KNOW THAT HE'S COMING AFTER ME IF HE'S ALREADY MADE THREATS TO ME. THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO DO THAT. THERE'S NO WAY FOR ME TO DO THAT. AND NOT IN. REJECTING THIS BILL MEANS YOU ARE RELEGATING. MILLIONS OF WOMEN. TWO POTENTIAL DEATH OR OR OR OR SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURY. AS A RESULT OF THE THREAT TO HAVE BEEN MADE TO THEM. THIS IS A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUE. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR ABOUT. OKAY SO -- A READING FROM YOUR BILL [inaudible] SECTION. ONE ON PAGE. THREE NUMBER THREE AND I DON'T SEE. A SHERIFF'S SHALL. UPON RECEIPT OF AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION IMMEDIATELY. AND WITHOUT DELAY ISSUE TO THE PERSON. A TEMPORARY LICENSE TO CARRY A PROVIDED YOU MEET ALL OF THE STANDARDS THAT HAVE TO BE MET. I'M TALKING [inaudible] TO THE SHARE OF THE SHERIFF SHALL NOT. PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE EMERGENCY LICENSE. INVESTIGATE THE BACKS OR THE VERACITY OF THE AFFIDAVIT. WHICH MEANS YOU WILL ALLOW PROHIBITED PERSONS FROM. BEING CHECKED ON WHETHER THAT I'M READING FROM YOUR BILL. SO YOU GET ALL YOUR RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION THAT YOU WANT BUT I'M [inaudible] AT LEAST. MISTER CHAIRMAN PLEASE AT LEAST STATE THE FACTS THAT'S WHY I CAN'T I CAN'T SECOND IS AFTER MR LACKEY. BUT I'M I'M ASSUMING HE'S GOING TO DO THAT.

I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- SO -- I AM ACCEPTING THAT MOMENTS AS MOCKED UP IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THE AMENDMENTS REMOVE THE VIDEOTAPING PROVISIONS OF THE ORIGINAL BILL. AS WELL AS THE BAN ON GUN DEALERS SELLING WEAPONS FROM THEIR HOMES WITH THESE AMENDMENTS I JUST CONFIRM THAT THE ACLU IS REMOVING THEIR OPPOSITION. AB TEN SIXTY FOUR IS A BILL SPONSORED BY THE BRADY CAMPAIGN AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE TO CRACK DOWN ON BAD ACTOR GUN DEALERS. WHO ARE THE LEADING SOURCE OF GUNS ON THE BLACK MARKET WHILE OUR STATE HAS ENACTED LAWS IN THE PAST TO REGULATE GUN DEALERS? FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS THIS BILL PROVIDES THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WITH AN APARTMENT ENFORCEMENT TOOL BY GIVING THEM THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE IMPOSE A CIVIL FINE OF UP TO ONE THOUSAND FIRST TIME VIOLATIONS. IN UP TO THREE THOUSAND FOR REPEATED OR EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS THIS BILL ALSO FALLS THE LEAD OF THIRTY TWO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE SITTING COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT A WRITER REQUIRES FIRE ARM DEALERS TO PURCHASE LIABILITY INSURANCE OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO ENSURE THAT ANY VICTIMS. OF THEFT SALE LEASE OR TRANSFER OF A FIREARM OR AMMUNITION BY GUN DEALER WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THEIR LOSS. I AM JOINED HERE WITH ME AMANDA BRADY -- RAIN CALIFORNIA AND STEVE LONELY FROM BRICK -- BRADY UNITED. SO AGAIN AMANDA WILCOX WITH BRADY CALIFORNIA ONE OF OUR KEY PROGRAMS FOR NATIONAL OFFICE IS COMBATING CRIME GUNS IN HOLDING GUN DEALERS ACCOUNTABLE. RATHER THAN LISTENING TO ME ON THIS BILL -- I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO STEVE LINLEY WHO IS WITH OUR BRADY NATIONAL OFFICE IN THE PROGRAM MANAGER IN LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS STEVE ONLY I'M I'M A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR VETERAN A LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAST EIGHT OF WHICH I SPENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. BUREAU FIREARMS REGULATING FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOW WITH AN ACTUAL -- BRADY UNITED AGAINST A GOVERNESS WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THE CALIFORNIA DOES VERY WELL BUT HOW WE CAN ENHANCE SOME ENFORCEMENT. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A ROBUST. INSPECTION PROGRAM OF THE CALIFORNIA LICENSED FIREARM DEALERS. HOWEVER THE ONLY THING THAT THOSE REGULATORS CAN DO. IS TO ISSUE WARNING LETTERS ADD TO THE DEALERS THERE'S NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION THERE IS NO PENALTY. FOR AN ACTIVITY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE REGULATORS THAT WENT IN THERE IS A VIOLATION. FROM ONE OF THESE DEALERS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SET SOME SORT OF PENALTY FOR THAT. AS IT IS RIGHT NOW ALL THE CAN ASK IS WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE THESE CHANGES WITH THIS NEW BILL IT'LL ALLOW THE OTHER APARTMENT TO TO ENSURE. THAT THERE ARE SOME COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE LAWS AND IF NOT THEY GIVEN OUT FINE THE END INDIVIDUAL DEALERS THERE'S ALSO A PROVISION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO HAVE. A REGULATORY PROCESS IN ORDER TO HAVE DUE PROCESS FOR THESE DEALERS. I PREFER AYE VOTE AND AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT. I SHOULD TIME ALL ALSO AUTHORIZED TO EXPRESS IN SUPPORT OF BAY AREAS FOR STUDENT ACTIVISTS CALVIN HAD TO CATCH A TRAIN. THANK YOU. IT WOULD IS IN SUPPORT. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA JUST CONFIRMING THAT WE HAVE REMOVED OPPOSITION AND I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] PROTECT [inaudible] SURE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN WAS CALIFORNIA AND THE LICENSE CALIFORNIA FIREARMS DEALER -- BOTH UNDER WITH THE FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSE AND A DEALER UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW -- THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT -- FOR FOR LIABILITY INSURANCE ONE MILLION DOLLARS IS IS SOMETHING THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY BUSINESS HAS AND I KNOW OF NO -- GUN DEALER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DOESN'T HAVE A ONE MILLION DOLLAR POLICY FOR THE FOR LIABILITY INSURANCE WHAT THIS BILL IS CALLING FOR IS NOT A ONE MILLION DOLLAR -- LIABILITY IT'S CALLING FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EVERY ACT THAT IS COMMITTED BY A GUN THAT IS STOLEN -- SOLD ILLEGALLY OR SOMEHOW GETS OUT OF THAT ARE OUT OF THAT DEALER THERE IS NO INSURANCE COMPANY IN THE WORLD. THAT WOULD ISSUE A A POLICY LIKE THAT IN THE AUTHORS STATEMENTS IN -- IN THE ANALYSIS THE TALKS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW FOR FOR LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS WHICH RUN ON CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT ANOTHER ACTIONS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE -- FOR FOR THE MISUSE OF THESE FIREARMS. NO INSURANCE POLICY IS GOING TO COVER CRIMINAL -- ACT BY BY SOMEBODY WHO WHO HAS THE THE THE POLICY SO -- IF IF THIS IS A BILL THAT WANTS TO PUT. GUN DEALERS OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY CANNOT COMPLY. WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL TO FIND THIS KIND OF INSURANCE POLICY THAT DOESN'T EXIST. THIS BILL WILL DO JUST THAT. AND IT WILL ACCOMPLISH NOTHING AND BY THE WAY. GUN DEALERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A FEW WAS BAD ACTORS OF ANY STATE GUN DEALERS -- NATION WIDE REPORTED REGULARLY -- THE KINDS OF BAD ACTORS THAT WERE MENTIONED BY THE BY THE AUTHOR -- THAT THEY THEY ARE VERY VERY VERY IN. A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE DEALERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS A A A NUCLEAR BOMB TO TRY TO AFFECT A VERY FEW -- NUMBER OF BUSINESSES IN FACT IT POTENTIALLY COULD PUT ALL DEALERS OUT OF BUSINESS. LOW'S REASONS -- WE OPPOSE INCLUDING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION. ONE TO MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ADEQUATE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE WITH NATURAL SOCIAIS TIONAL SO HERE FOR CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION. IN STRONG OPPOSITION ALL ECHO WITH MY COLLEAGUE MISTER PRATHER SAID -- I'M UNAWARE OF OF THIS CALL THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE EVEN EXISTING THAT -- PROTECTS AGAINST -- ACTS OF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST THE LAW I MEAN I WOULD BE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE IF THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY AND AND SEE IF THAT COULD BE PROVIDED. I'M ALSO THERE'S THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE AMENDMENT THAT ALLOWS -- LOCAL LOCALITIES TO IMPOSE EVEN MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS SO DOES THAT MEAN -- CITY A IS GOING TO HAVE REQUIRED TWO MILLION PER INCIDENT OR FIVE MILLION -- I'M. YOU KNOW VARIOUS GUN DEALERS HAVE DIFFERENT SIZE INVENTORIES AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THE COSTS ON ON THIS TYPE OF POLICY IF IT DOES EXIST -- HI I JUST I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH -- ALONG WITH THE HOST OF LOCAL ORDINANCES THAT COULD COME WITH THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IMMIGRANT CRP A AND ARE A MEMBER OR STRONGLY OPPOSED. OKAY. ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMMENT. YEAH I THINK CLEARLY THIS -- THIS PROVIDES AS THE OPPOSITION JUST STATED. SEVERAL UNREALISTIC MANDATES AND I THINK THAT PUTTING GUN DEALERS OUT OF BUSINESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD PLEASE SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM. MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. REMOVED AND SECOND -- YOU MAKE CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK BY ABOUT. IT SO MISS MESSAGE I THANK YOU FOR TAKING. THE AMENDMENTS -- THE CONCERNS OF THE AND I PROBABLY SHOULD ASK YOU. IN YOUR CLOTHES ABOUT THE MILLION DOLLAR BECAUSE THAT THAT WAS ONE OF MY CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT -- ANYONE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING ABLE -- TO GET THAT INSURANCE WAS ONE BUT TO WHETHER IT BE THE TYPE OF INSURANCE. THAT WOULD. THAT ANY PERSON COULD GET WITH THEIR HOUSE OR WITH ANYTHING ELSE ON THAT THIS WOULD NOT PRECLUDE ANYBODY. FROM GETTING IT BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAT IT WAS NOT -- I THINK YOU STATED TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT SOMETHING. THAT YOU LOOKED AT IS PUTTING PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS THE THE MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH IS LIABILITY TO HANDLE. IF SOMETHING WERE TO UNFORTUNATELY HAPPEN TO WOULD BE SOMETHING IN PLACE -- TO TO HELP WITH THE DAMAGES THAT OCCURRED. AND SO -- I'VE. GO AHEAD IN IN INTO A LET'S MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BUT I WHEN HE GETS TO THE FLOOR. I HOPE THAT WE OR DID YOU CAN BRING TO THE COMMITTEE IN COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ME ESPECIALLY SHOWING THAT -- THE MILLION DOLLAR REQUIREMENT IS NOT COST PROHIBITIVE. AT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BECAUSE THAT I THINK THAT. AGAIN WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC -- FOR FOR ME I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER MEMBERS BUT IT WOULD BE FOR ME. CAROLINE MISTER CHAIRMAN AS AS I INDICATED MY OPENING STATEMENT ACCORDING TO GET FIRST LAWCENTER THERE ARE ALREADY -- THIRTY TWO JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE CITY AND COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT ALREADY HAS THIS -- LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIREMENT WITH THE MINIMUM COVERAGE OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS SO YOU KNOW IF IF THERE IS ANY -- ANY CLARIFICATION THAT THAT THAT THAT'S NEEDED I I WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDE THAT TO YOU -- AND TO ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THAT REQUEST THAT OKAY SO LET'S GET CLARIFICATION ON THAT THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. ON AB TEN SIXTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. TO ANSWER I LACKEY. LACKEY NOPE BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP NO DEEP NO KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK HI QUIRK I SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I THE MEASURES ARE CALL NEEDS ONE THANK YOU FOR MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. I'M SORRY MS GONZALEZ WHATEVER YEARS. I ANSWER TO IT ALL [inaudible] ALL [inaudible] ALL RIGHT -- MY TALKING POINTS SAY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR THAT A GOOD AFTERNOON AFTER THE SIX YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANTS GAIN THE RIGHT TO A DRIVER'S LICENSE SO THEY COULD BE LAW ABIDING DRIVERS AN EFFORT AIMED AT PROVIDING ALL THIS PEACE OF MIND. ON THE ROAD BUT NOW FEAR IS UNDERMINED AB SIXTY LICENSE PROGRAM RECENT NEWS REPORTS HAVE BEEN COVERED THAT SOMEHOW IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN ACCESSING STATE RUN DATABASES CONTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH LICENSEES. AT THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER AB. SIXTY IT'S NOT. IT APPEARS THAT OUR EYES COULD LEARN THE NAME OF AN IMMIGRANT AND PUT IT INTO THE CLASS. DATABASE AND END UP PULLING UP -- THE INFORMATION FROM THEIR THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. AS A RESULT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN -- OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY ICE THIS I WE WOULD LIKE TO AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN WOULD PREVENT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM MAKING THEIR DATABASES INCLUDING THOSE MAINTAINED BY PRIVATE VENDORS AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT. THIS WOULD NOT APPLY TO INFORMATION WITHIN THOSE DATABASES ON INDIVIDUALS WITH ACTIVE ARREST WARRANTS IN OTHER WORDS THEY COULDN'T GO FISHING THROUGH THE DATABASE TO FIND INFORMATION ON OTHERWISE. LAW ABIDING IMMIGRANTS DATE COULD ONLY USE THAT IF THERE IS AN ACTIVE ARREST WARRANT -- THE DMV ASSERTS IT DOES NOT RELEASE ANY APPLICANT A DOCUMENTS EXCEPT IN RESPONSE TO CRIMINAL CURRENT CRIMINAL SUBPOENA SO THIS WILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE -- THESE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY TACTICS ARE CONCERNING OBVIOUSLY TO COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE AND THEY'RE KEEPING PEOPLE FROM. RE UPPING THEIR AB SIXTY LICENSE WHICH MAKES OUR STREETS ALL AND SEE MORE AND SAFE FOR ALL OF US. A I HAVE. CHIRLA HERE -- TO TEST FIND SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN A MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOSEPH JETT ADDRESS OUR POLICY NOW BECAUSE HE WOULD CHEER Là. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT STRONG SUPPORT AB SEVENTY FORTY SEVEN IMMIGRATION INFORMANTS ENFORCEMENT HAS A BALL FROM HUMAN OF FOR ENFORCEMENT TO AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT BASE AND IS THAT A BASIS. WE SELL A PEAK WHEN SECURE COMMUNITIES WAS CREATED DURING THE BUSH ERA. TO TURN THE FINGERPRINT OF ANYONE INTO A AND ALSO SHARED WITH DHS WHEN THEY DO AN INVESTIGATION. THIS AUTOMATED SYSTEM IS A RESULTING OR IS IT RESULTING IN THE RUSSIAN OF TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM INCLUDE INCLUDES. THIRD PARTY ENTITIES IN WHICH THERE IS NO ICE THE IN WHICH I SCHEME. IS THAT A WITH THE BILL OKAY IN ART IS NOT REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A JUDICIAL WARRANT. SINCE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIXTY CHIRLA HAS HER OF CASES OF THAT WERE BROUGHT TO ATTENTION IN WHICH WE ALSO BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE NBS STAFF OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD. NO CRIMINAL OFFENSES THE ONLY THING THAT THE HOW DIRECTOR WES ANY QUESTION TO PETITION ORDER -- UP AS AN EXAMPLE IS -- IS A MEMBER THAT WE HAD. GABRIELLE WHO WAS THE REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS A FORMER RESIDENTS OF WEST COVINA HE APPLIED FOR A DRIVER LICENSE USING HIS REAL NAME -- AND HE'S ADDRESS AND ALL HIS CURRENT INFORMATION AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS -- HOMELESS SECURITY INVESTIGATION A UNIT OF ICE SHOP TOO HE'S TO HIS HOUSE AND ESSENTIALLY DEPORT HIM. THIS BILL. RISK PROTECTIONS I'M ALREADY UNDER AB SIXTY WITHOUT ANY DIFFERENT WE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ANY OTHER DATABASES FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE AS WE TAKE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRENCH THIS IN THIS BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARGOT GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYWAY THIS IS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAKE LOOKS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTE SECOND. ON AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS DEPOSITED JUDICIARY COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER TO ANSWER I LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING BAUER-KAHAN. DEEP A ROAD DEEP NOT VOTING KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] QUIRK [inaudible] SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I THAT. MEASURES ON CALL WE NEED THREE MORE. WE NEED TO MORE BODIES SO. UNLESS MR LACKEY WOULD LIKE TO GO NOW [inaudible] OKAY YOU [inaudible] YOU NEED. THE BILL ALL [inaudible] OKAY YES DO IT. START WITH WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO STOP START WITH. YES MISTER THE OPERAS HERE SO THAT'S GREAT. THEY CAN CARE. ITEM NUMBER THIRTY A. B. SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX CRIMINAL PROCEDURE DETERMINATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES IN THANK YOU STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB. SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO REDUCE PROSECUTORIAL OVERCHARGING. IN CRIMINAL COURTS INTO APPLIED OF FELONIES PROTECTIONS THAT ALREADY EXISTS UNDER CURRENT LAW. FOR MISDEMEANORS AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX ALLOWS A PERSON IMMEDIATELY AT THE INITIAL. ARRAIGNMENT TO TO REQUEST A DETERMINATION OF PROBABLE CAUSE ON EACH CHARGE THE JUDGE WILL THEN MAKE THE DETERMINATION BEFORE THE CASE. CONTINUES WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WITH OVER CHARGING CHARGING. FOR CRIMES FOR WHICH THERE IS NOT YET PROBABLE CAUSE OR MAY NEVER BE. IT CAN LEAD TO UNNECESSARY DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY. FOR INDIVIDUALS IT CAN ALSO LEAD TO WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AS INNOCENT. PEOPLE ARE FORCED INTO ACCEPTING PLEA DEALS IN LIEU OF SERIOUS CHARGES THAT MAY NOT BE BASED ON PROBABLE CAUSE. WITH. THE CHARGES INTERACTION WITH BAIL [inaudible] THE CHARGE COOLEY TO CRITICALLY HIGH BAIL SCHEDULES OR HI BILL AMOUNTS -- WHICH DETAIN FOLKS AND HAVE PUT AT RISK THEIR JOBS THERE -- KIDS POTENTIALLY THEIR HOMES THEIR CARS AND FURTHER ENCOURAGE THEM AND SENT THEM TO TAKE CONVICTIONS THAT THAT THEY ARE TO TAKE PLEASE THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE -- THEY ALSO WHEN YOU'RE DETAINED IT IT'S HARDER TO MAKE YOUR CASE AND TO BE OUT AND IN THE COMMUNITY WITH YOUR ATTORNEY AND BE ABLE TO DEFEND YOURSELF -- AND WE ALSO KNOW FROM DATA INCLUDING DATA FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. THAT WITH OUR OVER CHARGING THEIR DESPERATE OUTCOMES SHARPLY DIVIDED ALONG RACIAL LINES AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM HAVING PRACTICED IN TWO COUNTIES CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND SEPARATE CISCO DID DOES DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHAT SIDE OF THE TRACKS YOU LIVE ON DISPROPORTIONATELY SOME CARRYING IN PRISON IF [inaudible] DOES PSYCHOLOGICALLY TRAUMATIZED THE PERSON HEARING THOSE CHARGES. TO THE CLASSICAL COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES OF PROLONGED INCARCERATION EVEN IF THE PRESENT IS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS TWO WEEKS. IN THAT TIME SUMMIT COULD LOSE THEIR JOB. CBS CAN BECOME INVOLVED. HOUSING CAN BE LOST BECAUSE THE BAIL IS LINKED TO THE CHARGES. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DO THAT PRELIMINARY HEARING TWO WEEKS BECAUSE THERE HAS TO BE TIME TO PREPARE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FOLKS WHO FEEL THEY ARE NOT GUILTY ACROSS THE STATE ARE PLEADING GUILTY DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND THEY'RE DOING THAT BECAUSE THEY FEAR CRUSHING SENTENCES AND THEY FEAR MULTIPLE SERIOUS CONVICTIONS. TOO MANY. ARE AFRAID. TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A TRIAL THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEIR INNOCENCE BECAUSE THE RISK IS SIMPLY. TOO HIGH [inaudible] IT'S UNFAIR. IT'S MORE THE WRONG. IT'S A PERVERSION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PILLARS. OF OUR SYSTEM THAT A PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE AND PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THIS LEGISLATION FURTHER WOULD BE A DETERRENT TO OVER CHARGING TO BEGIN WITH AND IT DOES PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THAT. WHEN IT HAPPENS WITHOUT DELAY WHEN APPROPRIATE? CALIFORNIA OFTEN LEADS THE NATION IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I COURAGE US TO KEEP IT GOING. IN ORDER IN HONOR OF JEFF LET'S PASS THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT. TWO MINUTES A YES SIR. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ESPANA IS ON THE POLICY COORDINATOR FOR THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. I'M ALSO KNOWN AS A R. C.. A. R. C. IS A SUPPORT NETWORK FOREIGN COMPRISE A FORMALLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ALL DEVOTED TO BECOMING -- LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AIR SEE ACCOMPLISHES ITS GOALS BY PROVIDING JOB TRAINING. SUPPORT OF HOUSING COMPREHENSIVE KATE CASE MANAGEMENT. AND BY CONNECTED ITS MEMBERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. PART TWO ENGAGING IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES MANY AIR SEA MEMBERS SERVED LONG PRISON SENTENCES FOR OFFENSES COMMITTED DURING THEIR YOUTH. FROM FEAR OF BEING CONVICTED OF MORE THAN THEY WERE GUILTY OF SOME OF THESE MEMBERS TOOK PLEA BARGAINS. WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL I THOUGHT ABOUT? THOSE OF MY MENTEES THAT TOOK PLEA BARGAINS. BUT SINCE I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTESI WILL TELL YOU ABOUT ONE OF THEM [inaudible] ANTONIO WELLINGTON. ANTONIO IS A HOT SHOT FOR THE US FORESTRY SERVICE. BUT BEFORE HE BECAME A HOT SHOT HE WAS CHARGED WITH FIVE ARMED ROBBERIES. FACING NEARLY TWO DECADES IN AN ADULT PRISON. ANTONIO CHOSE TO TAKE THE FIRST PLEA BARGAIN HE WAS GIVEN. ONE COUNT OF ARMED ROBBERY WHEN HE WAS REALLY ONLY GUILTY OF BURGLARY. HE TOOK THIS PLEA BECAUSE AND I QUOTE. IT DIDN'T MATTER IF I ACTUALLY DID IT OR NOT. THEY WANTED ME TO BE GUILTY. STE AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GAMBLE WITH MY LIFE [inaudible] FEAR [inaudible] TREPIDATION [inaudible] DESPERATION. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO POST BAIL. ALL BROUGHT THIS SIXTEEN YEAR OLD TEENAGER. TO PLEASE TO AN ADULT FELONY. ANTONIO STORY EXEMPLIFIES HOW OVER CHARGING CAN LEAD. EVEN OUR YOUTH INTO PLAIN GUILTY TO CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. THIS FEAR OF BEING CONVICTED OF THESE OVER CHARGING OR FAR REACHING CHARGES LET ANTONIO TO TAKE A PLEA BARGAIN BEFORE HE EVEN WENT INTO IS A AND TO HIS PRELIMINARY HEARINGS. AND I USE THE TERM FAR REACHING BECAUSE ALL WE ARE ASKING. IS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW DEFENDANTS. TO ASK THE JUDGE FOR HIS OR HER DISCRETION ON WHETHER PROBABLE CAUSE EXISTS WITHIN THE CHARGES. IF THE JUDGE THEN DEEMS THE PROBABLE CAUSE DOES IN FACT EXIST. THEN IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL. AS I WAS AS I'M SURE THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS IT IS NOT HARD TO PROVE PROBABLE CAUSE. BEING A FIREFIGHTER HAS BECOME A DREAM OF ANTONIO'S. YEAH BECAUSE OF THIS ADULT PHONY THAT HE PLAYED TO HIS HIS UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN EMT LICENSE. ANTONIO IS JUST ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE FACED THE I'M JUST PRESSURES OF OVERCHARGING. THIS BILL PROPERLY GIVES JUDGES DISCRETION TO APPLY CHARGES WITH MORE FAIRNESS AND MORE REASONING. I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND I STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL.

MANY HAD CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU WHEN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES SIR GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LAURIE MORE SOMEBODY HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA IS AB. SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX THIS BILL CREATES AN ENTIRELY NEW. COSTLY AND UNNECESSARY LAYER OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE PROBABLE CAUSE EXISTS IN A FELONY COMPLAINT. UNDER CURRENT LAW ALL PERSONS ARRESTED FOR A FELONY OFFENSE HAVE A RIGHT TO A CONTESTED PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING I EAT A PRELIMINARY HEARING WITHIN TEN DAYS OF THEIR ARRAIGNMENT. THIS TIME HONORED PROCEDURE. THAT A MAGISTRATE DETERMINES AFTER AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IN WHICH WITNESSES ON BOTH SIDES CAN BE CALLED THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FOR A DEFENDANT TO FACE TRIAL ON THE CHARGES. IF A MAGISTRATE DETERMINES THAT THE EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT. ANY OR ALL OF THE CHARGES ARE DISMISSED. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX WHAT ESSENTIALLY CREATE AN ADDITIONAL PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING AT ARRAIGNMENT. THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY SNARL THE COURT SYSTEM BY REQUIRING HIGH VOLUME ARRAIGNMENT JUDGES TO REVIEW DECLARATIONS POLICE REPORTS OR OTHER RECORDS TO JUSTIFY THE CHARGES IN THE COMPLAINT. AND UNLIKE A PRELIMINARY HEARING IN WHICH WITNESSES ARE CALLED AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX CALL FOR A SIMPLE PAPER REVIEW. WITH NO WITNESS TESTIMONY BEING TAKEN. MOREOVER THE FINDINGS OF THE ARRAIGNMENT MAGISTRATE AREN'T EVEN BINDING ON THE MAGISTRATE AT THE SUBSEQUENT PRELIMINARY HEARING. AS A COURTROOM PROSECUTOR FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT AB SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX IS ON WORKABLE. IN MANY SERIOUS CASES THAT INVOLVE ELECTRONIC RECORDS FOR EXAMPLE CHARGES ARE OFTEN ADDED ONCE THOSE ELECTRONIC RECORDS ARE REVIEWED IF THE DEFENDANT WERE ENTITLED TO AN IMMEDIATE HEARING WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS IS THIS BILL PROPOSES. COURTS WOULD BE FORCED TO REVIEW VOLUMINOUS RAW RECORDS OR EVIDENCE BECAUSE THEY HEARING IS TAKING PLACE FASTER THAN THE POLICE REPORTS CAN BE COMPILED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROSECUTION FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL WILL COMPLICATE HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROSECUTIONS AND LIKELY RESULT IN DISMISSAL OR DELAY OF LEGITIMATE HUMAN TRAFFICKING CHARGES. THERE BY PUTTING MORE VICTIMS AT RISK. OFTENTIMES ARRESTS ARE MADE BUT IF IN ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION CONTINUES AND POLICE OFFICERS NEED TIME TO WRITE REPORTS OR COLLECT EVIDENCE. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MAKES A DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARGES TO FILE OFTEN WITH MORE INFORMATION THAN THE INITIAL RATHER ARRESTING OFFICER HAD AT THE TIME OF THE ARREST. HAVING TEN COURT DAYS TO COMPLETE FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND COMPILE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS INSURERS THAT AT THE TIME THE MAGISTRATE IS CALLED UPON. TO MAKE A PROBABLE CAUSE DETERMINATION HE OR SHE HAS ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION. WHILE THE PROCEDURE SIMILAR TO A. B. SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX EXISTING MISDEMEANOR COURT VIA PENAL CODE SECTION. NINE NINE ONE IT IS FRANKLY ALMOST NEVER USED. AND THERE ARE PIVOTAL DISTINCTIONS FIRST MISDEMEANOR CASES DO NOT HAVE THE PROTECTION OF A PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION WITHIN TEN COURT DAYS OF RAIN. SECOND. PC NINE NINE ONE ONLY APPLIES TO MISDEMEANORS WHO ARE IN CUSTODY THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO ALL FELONIES REGARDLESS OF CUSTODIAL STATUS. ESPECIALLY ALARMING IS THE RECENT AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL WHICH WOULD CREATE A DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE. AGAIN THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY IMPACT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES FOR EXAMPLE IN WHICH THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO A SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION IS GAINING THE COOPERATION OF WITNESSES. CASES ARE OFTEN DISMISSED BECAUSE OF VICTIMS FAILED TO SHOW UP THIS BILL WOULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO REFILE CASES WHEN. TO VICTIMS DECIDE TO COOPERATE. FINALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THE MAGISTRATE TO CONSIDER ANY OF EVIDENCE PROFFERED BY THE DEFENDANT THAT SUPPORTS A FINDING OF NO PROBABLE CAUSE. BY CONFERRING A RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE. THIS PROVISION WILL ALLOW THE DEFENSE TO PRESENT UNTESTED AND UNCONTRADICTED EVIDENCE AT A HEARING. DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE. IN SOME THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER LONG ESTABLISHED SAFEGUARDS AND WOULD CAUSE AN EXPENSIVE AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. FOR THESE REASONS CDA IS VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS CORY CELLS -- ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. HE TOOK ALL MY ARGUMENTS SO FOR THE IN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IN THE COMMITTEES RESOURCES I'LL SIMPLY SAY WOULD ASSOCIATE OUR MARKS WITH MISTER MORRISON -- RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW VOTE THANK YOU I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THAT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE YOU QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MISS PARK AREA [inaudible] I'M. SO. THE RATE TO A PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING WE INCARCERATE SOMEONE TO TAKE THEIR FREEDOM AWAY BEFORE WE HOLD THEM IS OBVIOUSLY A RIGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD NEVER TOUCH -- AND THAT RIGHT STANDS I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING WITH WHY WE NEED TO APPLY THIS TO ALL THE CHARGES WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF THAT AND SECONDARILY. I'M CONCERNED WITH THE ABILITY TO ADD ON AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD STOP A PROSECUTOR FROM LATER ADDING ON CHARGES. AND IF THEY WERE TO DISCOVER AGAIN IN THE PILE OF EVIDENCE THAT THERE WERE OTHER CHARGES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THAT WERE NOT. REALIZED IN THOSE FIRST THREE DAYS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. MY VIEW IS THAT IF IF YOU HAVE THIS FOR MISDEMEANORS FOR LOWER LEVELS OF CRIME. WHEN THE STAKES ARE ARGUABLY LOWER? THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THEM FOR FELONIES WHEN THE STAKES ARE MUCH HIGHER WHERE YOU CAN BE DEPRIVED OF YOUR LIBERTY WHERE YOU COULD BE. PRESSURED TO TAKE A PLEA AND ALTHOUGH A A FULL EVIDENTIARY HEARING IS TEN DAYS AWAY FROM THE ARRAIGNMENT AT THE PROBABLE -- AT THE PRELIMINARY HEARING. THAT COULD BE A LIFETIME. WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL AWAY FROM YOUR JOB AWAY FROM YOUR KIDS? THINKING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER YOU SHOULD TAKE A PLEA. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TAKE LIGHTLY [inaudible] AND I AM [inaudible] SO. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY. I AM. AT EARLY STAGE BECAUSE THIS BILL BASICALLY SAYS THIS. CHARGE WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE. FOR CHARTER YOU HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE. FOR IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE TODAY BUT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT LATER. WAIT. AND THEN YOU CAN CHARGE WHEN WHEN THE PROBABLE CAUSES REALIZED BUT DON'T OVER CHARGE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE IN A POSITION OF LEVERAGE. AND BETTER NEGOTIATING POWER AND HAVE A DEFENDANT OVER THE BARRELS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THEM TAKE A PLEA. ON SOMETHING TO GET YOUR CASE LOW DOWN. THAT'S NOT FAIR THAT'S NOT RIGHT WE KNOW OVER CHARGING IS A PROBLEM. THIS IS A MODEST PROPOSAL TO ASK A JUDGE IT WILL BE A NEUTRAL ARBITER. WHO WILL SEE EVIDENCE AND WILL DETERMINE WHETHER AT THAT MOMENT THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE CURRENT CHARGES -- AND IT WILL INCENT PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE WHAT THEY HAVE EVIDENCE FOR AND NOT TO CHARGE WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE FOR BUT TO YOUR QUESTION THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE AT A LATER TIME BUT THEY HAVE. PROBABLE CAUSE FOR AS THEIR INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE QUESTIONS. A MISTER BONTA. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AYE AYE. RIGHT DID YOU. DID YOU ONCE I'M SORRY YOU LEVEL OKAY. ARE YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE YOU WANT TO TRY IT IS OR I DON'T WANT TO OKAY RESPONDED BY ANNOUNCED QUEST OKAY. GO IT MISSED BEHIND. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I YOU KNOW I I JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID EARLIER ABOUT. A PUBLIC DEFENDER ADACHI.% I REMEMBER THE TIME HE CALLED ME AND HE ASKED ME ABOUT. THIS IDEA THAT HE HAD. TO CREATE SOME PARITY BETWEEN FELONIES MISDEMEANORS WITH RESPECT TO NINE AND ONE HEARINGS THAT HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD REALLY. HELP CURB SOMETHING THAT WE ALL KNOW TO BE TRUE THAT THERE IS. UNFORTUNATE OVERCHARGING IN OUR SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR FAIR CHARGING IN CHARGE CONSISTENT WITH EVIDENCE AND AVOID SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEEN FROM OVER CHARGES SO I THINK IT'S A WISE AND PRUDENT APPROACH. TO THE ONGOING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THAT WE'VE BEEN PURSUING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU -- CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND I'D ONCE I GET A MOTION OKAY. ON AB SEARCH SIXTEEN THIRTY SIX THE MISSION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER CHEN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. OF VOTING DEEP NOT VOTING KAMLAGER-DOVE HAVE QUIRK SANTIAGO. WICKS AN HONOR MISTER DODGY AYE WICKS I THAT. MEASURES ARE CALLING NEEDS. TO THE NEXT ONE MR BONTA. THANK YOU AB. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE YES MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. GUN SHOWS IN ADVANCE YES KEPT IN ARE A BUSY TODAY. PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE DOES NOT REQUIRE INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS TO COMPLY WITH THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER VENDORS A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE CLOSES THE SECURITY LOOPHOLE INSURERS THAT INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME. VETTING REQUIREMENTS AS OTHER VENDORS IN DOING SO A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE STANDARDIZES THE WAY IN WHICH FIRE ARM DEALERS AND INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS. ARE TREATED ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL MODERNIZE THOSE. SECOND. THANK YOU MODERNIZE IS THE DROSS BEAT THE THIRTY TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS -- CATCHING IT UP WITH INFLATION HAS BEEN RAISED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND BY ADJUSTING THE TRANSACTION FEE TO MORE ACCURATELY RECOUP THE ENFORCEMENT COST OF THE PROGRAM THE PUBLIC CAN HAVE GREATER SURETY THAT ALL. AMMUNITION VENDORS ARE COMPLYING WITH CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AB SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION I RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY ACTUALLY AIRS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YET TO BE SET ASIDE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT I GET AFTERNOON TOO MANY MY NAME IS ACTUALLY AREAS IN THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- INSPECTED WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF AB. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE AT THE BILL ACCOMPLISHES TWO THINGS OF THE SOME A MEMBER REFERRED TO I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE LAST BUT NOT LEAST. AT THE FIRST HAS BEEN IN RELATIONSHIP TO INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS THE RAV THANK YOU FOR ALL ACT PROP SIXTY THREE ADDRESSED. I MEAN SOME ANY MINUTE AMMUNITION VENDORS BUT DID NOT ADDRESS ALL OF THE PENAL CODE SECTIONS OF THOSE VENDORS WHO MAY BE SELLING AMMUNITION IT WOULD INCORPORATE. THE ELEMENTS OF PROP SIXTY THREE TO ALL OF THE PENAL CODE SECTION SO THAT DEALERS ARE TREATED. EQUALLY AND THERE IS NO DIFFERENT IMPACT AND DEPENDING ON WHAT IS IT YOU ARE SELLING AND WHERE. THE SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL RELATES TO THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE OR THE GROSS FEES -- WE ARE PROPOSING TO RAISE THE FEE TO THIRTY TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS. IN ADDITION -- TO READING IT. INDEPENDENT OF THE CPI AND GRANTING THE DEPARTMENT ALREADY IN ORDER TO ADJUST AS NECESSARY. A COUPLE OF THINGS I WILL SAY IN REGARDS TO THIS THE NUMBER IT THAT WAS CALCULATED WITH A VERY SPECIFIC CALCULATION AND VERY PRECISE CALCULATION. IT IS INTENDED TO COVER THE COST OF ALL OF THE LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN PASSED UP UNTIL THIS POINT IN ORDER SO THAT THE DROVES. ACCOUNT DOES NOT OPERATE IN THE NEGATIVE SO IT IS NOT PERSPECTIVE IT ALL IS NOT INTENDED TO COVER ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION WITHOUT THIS FEE INCREASE THE ACCOUNT WILL BE NEGATIVE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. ADDITIONALLY I HAVE. IN REGARDS TO THE CPI EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT HAD RAISED THE CPI FOR THE LAST TIME THE CPI. WITH THAT HE WAS RATES BY CP I WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SO EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT HAD RAISED BY THE CBI EVERY YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR THE ULTIMATE FEE WOULD NOT COVER THE ULTIMATE COST. OF ALL THE PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS AT THE DEPARTMENT RELIES ON THE SPECIAL FUNDS FOR THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE IT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH. SO THANK YOU AGAIN I HAVE WITH ME IF THE COMMITTEE HAS ANY QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO THE INDEPENDENT MISSION IN A LICENSE OR ANY OTHER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. OUR SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE BILLY GRAHAM WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU FIREARMS. THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. AMANDA WILCOX HERE ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THAT ADDRESS THE EMISSION VENDER UM LICENSE SITUATION AT GUN SHOWS A MAKE A COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PROP. SIXTY THREE AND WE DO INDEED SUPPORT RAISING THE TROPHY I'VE ACTUALLY ADVOCATED THAT -- FOR NUMBER OF YEARS NOW -- I UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICES IN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIND THE ALL THE REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON THEM. AND THE DROSE FEE HAS BEEN REYES ONCE SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE OUR SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE COST OF GUNS HAVE GONE UP THE COST OF LABOR HAS GONE UP AND WE HAVE NOW ACTED. LAWS THAT HAVE PLACE DEMAND ON THE DRUGS HE ACCOUNT ONE OF WHICH WAS THE DISARM HATE ACT -- THAT WAS CARRIED BY THE CHAIR HERE. I KNOW A BILL WITH BROAD SUPPORT THE ANYTIME WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE'S A COST TO DO J. TO CHANGE THEIR DATABASES TO IMPLEMENT THAT LAW. I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THE I. T. AND THE TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES AND THE CAPACITY ARE THAT THE DOJ SYSTEM HAS AND THAT NEEDS TO THE X. CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT. IN UPGRADE -- IF THE GROSS V. HAD BEEN RAISED ALONG WITH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX MY AT BY MY ESTIMATE BE TWENTY SIX DOLLARS NOW AND THAT'S OUR UNFORTUNATELY IT ON THE FEE WAS NOT REYES INCREMENTALLY. WHICH WAS ALLOWED UNDER EXISTING LAW SO NOW THEY'RE TO APPEARS TO BE A DRASTIC INCREASE -- IT IT FEELS DRASTIC HI I WOULD GRANT THAT BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT WASN'T DONE ALL ALONG AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN -- THE NEED IS THERE AND THE BRADY CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS -- RAISING THE FEE. TO ASSESS DOJ IN DOING THE WORK THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO TO IMPLEMENT OUR LOSS THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. HOW AND I SHOULD TO OFFER THE BAY AREA OF? FOR STUDENT ACTIVISTS AREN'T SUPPORT. NOW YOU'RE AFTER MAKE ROOM THANK. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S IT'S FIREARMS TAX DAY APPARENTLY -- THE END RESULT IS THE NATIONAL. THEY AGREE WITH THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE FOR C. R. PA IN STRONG OPPOSITION. TO AB -- SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE AS FAR AS THE CHANGES TO A CONFORMING GUN SHOWS FOR AMMUNITION PURCHASES WE FEEL THAT'S COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY -- STATE AND FEDERAL LAW APPLY WHETHER YOU'RE AT A GUN SHOW OR AT A BRICK AND MORTAR AND SO WE FEEL THAT THAT PORTION OF THE BILL'S UNNECESSARY -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO AB SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE RECALL REGARDING -- DEROSE. THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK WHEN IT COMES TO DROGO'S. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG DAY AND SOLD. DO MY BEST TO BE BRIEF. SO IF YOU YOU HEARD THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO RECOVER THE JOKES COSTS IN AND COVER PAYMENTS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE DRUGS HE WAS AND I WAS TO COVER. BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE TRANSFER REGISTRY -- OVER THE YEARS ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SEEN THIS DROVE THE GET OPENED UP TO ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF X. X. EXPENDITURES TO PAY FOR ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DOJ ACTIVITIES. AND SO I'D BE CURIOUS. TO SEE -- WHAT IS EACH PROGRAM WITHIN -- THE DROSS IS CURRENTLY PAYING -- FOR COSTING. YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT DE DEROSE ACCOUNT HAS AMASSED A SURPLUS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE WE BORROWED FROM THE DRUGS ACCOUNT TO TRY IN. A REDUCE THE APP'S BACKLOG WHICH IS A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY -- BUT WE WE SAW THAT ACCOUNT HIT RECORD HIGHS AND NOW FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE HEARD THAT THE DRUGS ACCOUNTED STRUCTURALLY IMBALANCE. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STRANGE PUT BEING PUT ON THE OJ -- BUT RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE HISTORY OF FIREARMS SALES ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST. SEVEN YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE PERIOD WHEN WE HAD THAT SURPLUS THERE WAS TWENTY THIRTY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDRESS ACCOUNT. THE GUN SALES ARE NOT NEARLY AS HIGH AS THEY ARE NOW FOR THE LAST. SEVEN YEARS WE SOLD AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FIREARMS PER YEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WHICH IS ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT WE WERE SELLING JUST A FEW YEARS SHORT YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE HAVING. THE SURPLUS I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THERE WAS A PROPOSED RULE FOR THE DATE ACTUALLY REDUCE THE DRAWS COSTS -- TO BETTER REFLECT -- THEIR ACTUAL COSTS I'M THE RULE NEVER WENT THROUGH BUT THEY WERE LOOKING AT TAKING IT FROM NINETEEN DOLLARS BACK DOWN TO I BELIEVE FIFTEEN OR FOURTEEN DOLLARS -- BECAUSE HE SAID EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE PROCESSING MORE TRANSACTIONS THEIR SYSTEMS ARE IMPROVED OBVIOUSLY AS WE'VE ENTERED IN THE DIGITAL AGE A LOT OF THIS IS. IS GETTING QUICKER -- MORE AUTOMATED I'M IN SO. WE'RE WE'RE STRONG OPPOSITION THIS IS JUST ANOTHER TAX ON GUN OWNERS TO TO FOOT THE BILL -- FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS DEROSE IS NEVER BEEN SUBJECT TO AN AUDIT THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL REQUEST OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO HAVE AN AUDIT THE DRAWS PROGRAM. AND I THINK THAT BEFORE WE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER DOUBLING THE JUROS FEE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A SERIOUS INQUIRY INTO WHERE THOSE MONIES ARE GOING. THERE IS THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO THAT ACCOUNT HOW MUCH IS GOING HOW MUCH IS IT ACTUALLY COSTS JUST TO PERFORM THE BASIC FUNCTION OF A BACKGROUND CHECK IN THE TRANSFER REGISTRY THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF THE DRUG PROGRAM NOT CHASING DOWN APPS PROGRAMS -- UPDATING COMPUTER SYSTEMS. FOR FOR WHO KNOWS WHAT I'M THERE'S A LOT ON TACKLE MY COLLEAGUES TALK WITH THAT WERE STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENT GUN WAS CALIFORNIA WANNA MAKE JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS NUMBER. ONE THIS BILL IS GOING TO OPEN UP THE THE THE DROSS. AS AN ABILITY IF A FUND TO FUND VIRTUALLY ANYTHING THAT DOJ WANTS TO DO IN THE REGARDING FARMS ANYTHING. I WOULD THINK THAT IN YOUR OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS THAT THE DRAWS FUNDS HAVE GONE TO PAY FOR WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN. TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOANS -- WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN USED. TO BALANCE THE BUDGET -- BOUGHT BY GOVERNORS IN THE PAST WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN LOANS TO OTHER PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO FIND BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE COME UP HERE. THE DEPARTMENT SAYS WE MINORING OBSERVABLE COSTS AND OF YOU KNOW THE THAT WE KNOW THAT THE THE DRAWS HAS BEEN THE SOURCE FOR FUNDING -- THOSE ACTIVITIES JUST TO PUT THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE. OVER THE LAST -- SEVEN RAY YEARS -- WITH THE APPROXIMATELY ACTUALLY MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION GUNS HAVE BEEN SOLD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT EQUALS MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS GONE INTO THE THE DRAWS FUN. WHERE'S THAT MONEY GONE THEY HAVEN'T HIRED THE YOU KNOW THEY KEEP THE PUTTING IN P. WISE TO HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO DO STUFF THEY'VE UPGRADED THEIR THEIR OF THEIR SOFTWARE AND AND AND THEN THEY SAY NOW WE CAN WE CAN COVER WE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS. WE CAN PERFORM MIRACLES. AND AND STILL -- THIS BEGS A VERY VERY HUGE QUESTION OF OVERSIGHT AND OVERSTEPPING AND THANK GOD IT'S A TWO THIRDS BILL. THANK MANY OF THE MOST YOUR TIME TO OKAY I'VE GOT A VERY VERY VERY BRIEF YOU'VE HAD A VERY LONG DAY -- KATHY LYNCH REPRESENT THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTSMAN'S COALITION IN CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY ALL IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I BELIEVE THIS A CONVERSATION WE OUGHT TO BE HAVING IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE -- AROUND THE ENTIRE PROGRAM -- WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE ON THE GUN SHOW ISSUE -- CLEARLY GUN SHOWS AND DEALERS IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THEIR BUSINESS ALL THE THE THE LAWS HAVE TO BE COMPLIED WITH. THAT YOU CURRENT COME COMPLY WITH SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF A NON ISSUE. I WOULD POINT OUT -- TO THAT THERE ARE TWO LAWSUITS PENDING ON IN THIS MATTER AND THERE'S ALSO A PRETTY OPEN ENDED NATURE WITH -- OTHER FEES IN THE FUN SUCH AS THE DOLLAR FIREARMS SAFETY ACT FEE THE FIVE DOLLAR FIREARM SAFETY AND FOR SOME P. THAT ARE KIND OF OPEN ENDED. AND REALLY CAN BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE AND IT REALLY FEELS TO US LIKE. IF WE'RE GONNA CONVERSATION CERTAINLY WE CAN APPRECIATE DOJ HAS CHALLENGES WE ALSO SET HERE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHERE THEY CONSTANTLY SAY. THERE ARE NO COST TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM YOU HAVE A MAJOR DATABASE CHIP SHIFT GOING UP THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WITH THE AMMUNITION REGISTRATION LONG GUN REGISTRATION WE KNOW FROM. CANADA AND OTHER PLACES THAT IMPOSE THIS THAT THEY'VE HAD MAJOR DATABASE PROBLEMS AND MANY LAWSUITS IT FEELS APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA. IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FIREARMS LAWS THAT ARE GOING TO WORK THEN WE NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM SO WE WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION A MOVE TO THE BUDGET. AND WE COMMIT TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. DEMOCRATS EUROPEAN CRP ACE AND ARE A MEMBER AND STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAKE CLOTHES MISTER BONTA.

THANK YOU AND I AND I GUESS IT DOES FEEL LIKE CALIFORNIA FIREARMS TAX DAY OF TO MY FRIEND TO DINNER RATED CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL SOCIALLY GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA. ANY OUTDOOR SPORTSMAN. I SIT ON BUDGET. AND I AM REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT DRUGS AND APPS IN THE END. OF I TAKE IT ON HIS RESPONSIBILITIES SINCE I'M ON SUB FIVE BUDGET. IT IS A REAL CONCERN. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU IS A VERY REAL CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE MONEY IS PAID.% AHEAD OF MONIES USED AND DISSEMINATED BUT I DON'T WANT TO STOP IT FROM COMING IN. YOU HAVE A VERY VALID POINT. ABOUT WE NEED TO FOCUS LIKE A LASER TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE MONIES ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY THAT MAY NOT BE HERE MAYBE THEY'LL AUDIT GROUP -- YOU MAY HAVE GIVEN ME AN IDEA FOR NOT IT SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH -- FOR AND CELTIC CHOSE RECOMMEND HI BUT I'M ALSO KEEP AN EYE ON BOTH STROH'S.
