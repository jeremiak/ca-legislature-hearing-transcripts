00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.853
IN TERMS OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.656
VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT. AND THERE

00:07:36.722 --> 00:07:37.323
ARE SOME ADVANTAGES TO FUEL

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.358
CELLS BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME

00:07:39.425 --> 00:07:40.893
BIG HURDLES THAT WERE WERE

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.395
TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.896
ADVANTAGES ARE THAT YOU CAN

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.232
HAVE QUICK REFUELLING BASICALLY

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:47.233
THE SAME AS THE INTERNAL

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.068
COMBUSTION VEHICLE AND YOU CAN

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.803
GO LONG DISTANCES THE

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.540
DISADVANTAGES WE DON'T HAVE OF.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.243
A ROBUST NETWORK THAT IS AS

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.445
CONVENIENT AS YOUR BRIEF

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:01.347
REFUELING STATION SO WE'RE

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.615
BUILDING OUT THAT THEIR

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:03.649
EDUCATION IS THE LEAD FOR

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:04.650
BUILDING OUT HYDROGEN

00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:07.687
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE ABOUT

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:09.388
FORTY FUEL CELL- HYDROGEN

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:10.990
REFUELING STATIONS NOW IN THE

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.825
STATE WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:14.060
THAT ARE FUNDED AND WE ARE

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:16.829
COMMITTED TO FUNDING UNTIL WE

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.698
HAVE A HUNDRED STATIONS.

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:19.732
OPERATIONAL IN THE STATE OF

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:24.036
CALIFORNIA. I WILL SAY THAT ON

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.972
HEAVY DUTY. I THINK IT'S PRETTY

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.340
CLEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.809
HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL VEHICLES

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:30.409
TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:32.678
GOALS- THERE CERTAIN DUTY

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:35.114
CYCLES THAT ARE BETTER FOR FUEL

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:37.016
CELLS. AND WE'RE SEEING SOME

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:38.618
INVESTMENT IN THAT SPACE BUT

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:41.087
NOT ENOUGH I'M I'M VERY

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:44.423
COMMITTED TO- ENSURING THAT AS

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.258
WE MOVE FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.560
WE ARE. ACTIVATING OTHER

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.195
COUNTRIES TO FOLLOW SUIT WE

00:08:49.262 --> 00:08:50.863
CAN'T DO IT ALONE WE CAN'T

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.098
BUILD GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.366
WITHOUT OTHER NATIONS REALLY

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.934
STEPPING UP AND BRINGING DOWN

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:57.703
THE PRICE OF FUEL CELLS. WE'RE

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.271
ALREADY SEEING THE PRICE OF

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.606
BATTERIES. CLIMATE PRESS THE

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.174
BATTERIES IS GUNNED DOWN 90% IN

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.542
THE LAST TEN YEARS IF IT

00:09:03.609 --> 00:09:05.077
CONTINUES IN THE NEXT FIVE TO

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.245
TEN YEARS. THESE VEHICLES WILL

00:09:06.312 --> 00:09:08.147
BE CHEAPER TO OWN. TO CHEAPER

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.983
TO BUY RATHER THERE ALREADY TWO

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:11.417
FOR TWO FIVE FROM AN

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:12.585
OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HIS

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:14.487
ELECTRICITY IS CHEAPER THAN.

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:16.489
THAN GASOLINE. BUT I WOULD SAY

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:17.390
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:21.327
THAT CALIFORNIA FOSTER'S DE UM

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.995
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ARE GOING

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:24.664
TO NEED FOR THE FUTURE AND WE

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.065
DO THIS IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.934
AND IS DO YOUR COMMENTS ADDRESS

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.702
BOTH THE COMMERCIAL USE.

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.704
HYDROGEN OF HYDROGEN COMMERCIAL

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:33.572
VEHICLES LIGHT MEDIUM OR HEAVY

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.375
AS WELL AS PASSENGER VEHICLES.

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:38.144
YEAH THE FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.745
THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUT HIS

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:40.813
HISTORICALLY JUST BEEN FOR

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.981
PASSENGER FEELS VEHICLES WITH

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:44.116
EXT EXPANDED THIS YEAR. TO

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:46.719
INCLUDE- HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.020
THEY ACTUALLY OF A DIFFERENT

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:48.521
INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:49.588
DIFFERENT FOR TECHNICAL

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.557
REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO AT IF YOU

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.693
OWN. A PASSENGER VEHICLE YOU

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.927
DON'T WANT TO BRIEF YOU DON'T

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:56.395
WANNA REVEAL NEXT TO A BIG LIKE

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:57.863
CLASS EIGHT TRUCK SO THERE'S

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.532
SOME JUST PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.534
TO HAVING THE TO- IN THE SAME

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.169
LOCATION. BUT THOSE ARE THOSE

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:04.270
ARE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON

00:10:04.337 --> 00:10:06.205
WE ARE DEFINITELY YOU KNOW OUR-

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.541
GOAL IS TO USE OUR FUNDS AS

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:11.377
MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO. EXPAND OUT

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.645
TO THE HEAVY MEDIUM AND HEAVY

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.080
DUTY SECTOR WHERE WE REALLY SEE

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:15.681
A NEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:17.149
MATTER TO MODE FOR THE MOVIE A

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:23.589
CONFIRMATION. YOU THANK YOU BYE

00:10:23.656 --> 00:10:26.359
CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU AYE MAN PUT

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:28.027
I A YES IN A CAN GROW ON

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:31.197
APPOINT. WE HAD CONVERSATION ON

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.866
THAT SIGN IS ONE OF TO TALK TO

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:37.570
WHICH IS BUT THE MAYBE MAYBE

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:39.972
TOUCH ON HOW. YOU SEE IS BEING

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.307
ABLE TO BALANCE CONSERVING

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.175
RESOURCES AND PROTECTING THE

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:45.344
ENVIRONMENT WITH HAVING A

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.513
SECURE RELIABLE MULTI FACETED

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.648
ENERGY SOURCES JUST KIND OF

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.817
MAYBE. YOUR VIEW ON HOW WE

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:54.887
CHECK ALL THAT. YES WELL LET ME

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.322
START IN THE TRANSPORTATION

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:57.656
SPACE THAT I KNOW THE BEST IF

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:58.324
YOU WANT WOULD LIKE TO TALK

00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.859
ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY CITING

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:00.893
HAPPY IT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.998
WELL. SO AS WE INVEST IN

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:07.566
CLEANER TRANSPORTATION AND AS

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:08.567
WE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.603
CAPITALIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITY

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:14.840
TO- TO REDUCE COSTS. WE NEED TO

00:11:14.907 --> 00:11:17.443
REALLY THINK THROUGH- WITH

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.444
BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:21.113
PARTICULAR HOW TO OPTIMIZE THE

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.782
CONNECTION OF THESE VEHICLES TO

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:25.017
THE GRID BECAUSE IF YOU. CHARGE

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:27.253
VEHICLES AT THE RIGHT TIME OF

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.489
DAY THEY PROVIDE A GREAT VALUE.

00:11:30.556 --> 00:11:32.425
IT ONE OF MY FAVORITE LITTLE

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.226
DATA POINTS IS THAT WE COULD

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.761
HAVE CHARGED EVERYONE OF OUR

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:37.029
ELECTRIC VEHICLES EVERYONE OF

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:37.797
OUR LIKE TO THE ELECTRIC

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:40.199
VEHICLES. WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:41.333
ENERGY THAT WE CURTAILED IN THE

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.102
MONTH OF MAY BECAUSE WE WERE

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.704
GENERATING. RENEWABLE ENERGY AT

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.139
A TIME WHEN WE COULDN'T USE AT

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.475
ALL. SO IF WE HAVE THIS HAPPY

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.177
MARRIAGE THAN WHAT IT RESULTS

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:54.713
IN IS LOWER COSTS FOR EVERYBODY

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.781
I THINK ELECTRIFICATION IN

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:57.383
GENERAL THERE'S A LOT OF DATA

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.951
THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IF

00:11:59.018 --> 00:12:01.654
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL- EVERYBODY

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.690
BENEFITS. BECAUSE THE VEHICLES

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.959
AND THE FUELS ARE. GOING TO BE

00:12:07.026 --> 00:12:08.828
CHEAPER AND THAT MONEY STAYS

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.863
HERE IN CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.199
BEING SENT OUT OF THE STATE. SO

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:15.134
IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN

00:12:15.201 --> 00:12:16.569
ELECTRIFYING LIGHT DUTY

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.537
TRANSPORTATION. THAT SHOULD BE

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:19.905
IT A GAME CHANGER NGUYEN IN

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.807
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF MONEY

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:23.509
SAVED AT THE PUMP. MONEY

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.977
RECIRCULATING THROUGH OUR

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:27.680
ECONOMY AND JOBS HERE IN THE

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:30.516
STATE. I ALSO THINK AS WE AS

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.853
WE- THINK ABOUT EQUITY- I. I

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.387
WOULD SAY WE NEED TO THINK ALSO

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.690
ABOUT HOW DO WE ENGAGE. GROUPS

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:41.827
THAT CAN ADVISE US. BECAUSE I

00:12:41.894 --> 00:12:42.294
CAN SAY COMING FROM A

00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:44.096
SCIENTIFIC WORLD YOU DON'T

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.397
NECESSARILY DO SCIENCE THAT IS

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:46.832
APPLICABLE TO THE REAL WORLD

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.534
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:51.070
EVERYTHING WE DO. IS GROUNDED

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:53.072
IN SOME KIND OF. UNITY BENEFIT

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:55.808
THE WE CAN ARE TO. AND THAT WE

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.910
CAN MEASURE. HISTORICALLY WE'VE

00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:00.779
MEASURED FROM OUR INVESTMENTS

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:02.014
IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:03.616
AND ATTENTIVENESS IT'S JUST

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:05.117
LIKE WELL HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:05.951
SPENDING IN DISADVANTAGED

00:13:06.018 --> 00:13:07.186
COMMUNITIES. SO WE'VE REACHED

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:08.787
OUT TO THE DISADVANTAGED VIEWS

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.056
ADVISORY GROUP AND ASK THEM FOR

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.791
LIKE WHAT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO

00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:13.592
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE METRIC BUT

00:13:13.659 --> 00:13:15.594
THAT'S NOT. ALL YOU KNOW THAT

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.096
DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE JOBS

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:17.897
CREATED THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:18.898
THEY'RE HEALTH BENEFITS THAT

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.699
DOESN'T MEAN. COMMUNITIES ARE

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:22.334
DIRECTLY BENEFITING SO HOW DO

00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:23.969
WE DO HOW DO WE ENGAGE THE

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.605
RIGHT PARTNERS WHO HELP ADVISE

00:13:26.672 --> 00:13:27.306
US SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP

00:13:27.373 --> 00:13:30.609
CRITERIA. THAT IS JUST SORT OF

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.545
A BIT MORE COMPLICATED A AND

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:34.880
GIVES US MORE CONFIDENCE THAT

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:36.315
WE ARE REALLY USING OUR MONEY

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:37.917
IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:41.387
EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION. RATE

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:42.555
AS THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:45.124
AND LOOKING TO- VOTING ICE ON

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.059
YOUR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU.

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:50.529
THANK YOU SENATOR MINING. THANK

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.031
YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:54.466
OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AND-

00:13:54.533 --> 00:13:56.035
YOU'RE MAKING THE REFERENCES TO

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:59.772
THE- WOMEN IN SCIENCE

00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:02.541
RECOGNITION AND ALSO THE-

00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:04.276
CRITICAL MASS THAT'S BEEN

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:07.012
ACHIEVED ON THE COMMISSION- I

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:08.414
WANT TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT ON

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.384
THE EQUITY PIECE- RELATED TO.

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:13.652
ELECTRIFICATION OF

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:16.455
TRANSPORTATION- WHEN WE TALKED

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:19.458
YESTERDAY. HE SHARED A LITTLE

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:20.259
BIT ABOUT COLLABORATION WITH

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:23.128
CARB IN IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.297
WITH THE COMMITTEE IN. WERE

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.432
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ON A

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.100
RENEWABLE ENERGY WE'RE BEHIND

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:30.302
ON OUR TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVE

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:32.705
SO WE'RE KIND OF PLAYING CATCH

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:34.540
UP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT. ON

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:36.976
THE EQUITY PIECE AS WELL THE

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:38.944
DISTRICT I REPRESENT WE HAVE

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.146
FARMWORKERS COMMUTING FROM KING

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:43.782
CITY TO WATSONVILLE TO HARVEST

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.751
STRAWBERRIES IN THAT. HOUR AND

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:48.954
A HALF ONE WINNIE COMMUTE ON.

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:51.991
AND IN OLDER VEHICLES NOT

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.994
ENERGY EFFICIENT- HAD IS THAT

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.497
POPULATION TRANSITION. TWO MORE

00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.199
FUEL EFFICIENT OR ELECTRICAL

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:02.801
VEHICLES THANK YOU CENTER

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:04.303
THAT'S THE THOSE ARE GOOD

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.672
QUESTIONS SO LET ME START WITH

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:08.307
THE COLLABORATIVE PIECE AND

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.676
THEN- TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO

00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:14.113
WITH- WITH FOLKS THAT YOU DON'T

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:15.314
HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO USE

00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:17.349
OLDER VEHICLES TO GET TO AND

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.084
FROM WORK- SO ON THE

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:21.387
COLLABORATION PIECE- I AM I AM

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.022
DEEPLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:25.024
THAT WE ARE REALLY CLOSELY

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.458
COLLABORATING ESPECIALLY WITH

00:15:26.525 --> 00:15:27.660
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD BUT

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:29.094
ALSO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:15:29.161 --> 00:15:30.696
COMMISSION. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.432
OPERATOR- CALTRANS WE HAVE A

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.301
LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTNERS WERE

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.369
ENGAGED IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.772
AND WE WANT TO BE STRATEGIC-

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.041
WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:45.244
TESTIFIED AT A RECENT RESOURCES

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.479
BOARD HEARING. BOARD MEETING

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:48.981
THAT. ARE FUNDING CLEAN

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:50.416
TRANSPORTATION GOING TO BE

00:15:50.482 --> 00:15:52.818
INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.820
INFRASTRUCTURE AND FUEL SIDE.

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:57.656
AS A R. B. IS INCREASINGLY- YOU

00:15:57.723 --> 00:15:59.391
KNOW THEY'RE THE PREMIER AGENCY

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.459
WHEN IT COMES TO VEHICLES SO IT

00:16:00.526 --> 00:16:02.561
MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO ALSO

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.763
LEAD IN THAT SPACE. WE ARE THE

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.599
PREMIER ENERGY IT THE- COMMA

00:16:07.666 --> 00:16:09.068
INDUSTRY IN THE STATE

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.202
INDUSTRIES ARE AGENCY IN THE

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.071
STATE AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.273
MAKING SURE THAT AS WE- THAT WE

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.410
pTO BE BENEFICIAL TO. OUR ENERGY

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.113
GOALS AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.183
1100% CLEAN ELECTRICITY COOL BY

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:24.783
TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO IT MAKES

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.619
SENSE FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:29.288
TO FOCUS MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:31.357
SO THAT WOULD BE- WHETHER THAT

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:32.925
THAT'S THE BUILD OUT OF

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:35.194
HYDROGEN FUEL CELL A

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.029
INFRASTRUCTURE THE BUILD OUT OF

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.831
REACH CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:40.499
FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.035
THE INVESTMENTS IN- NEAR UP

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.570
NEAR ZERO AND ZERO MISSION

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:47.339
FUELS TO HELP WITH VEHICLES

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.974
THAT ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.008
CAN BE EASILY ELECTRIFIED

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:52.177
THEY'RE STILL IN NEED TO

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.613
ADDRESS THOSE VEHICLES- AND

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.614
ADDRESS EMISSIONS FROM THOSE

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.550
VEHICLES SO I EIGHT I FEEL THAT

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:00.185
WE ARE GETTING MORE CLARITY

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:01.086
BETWEEN EXPECTED THEIR

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:02.888
RESOURCES BOARD AND THE ENERGY

00:17:02.955 --> 00:17:03.722
COMMISSION ABOUT WHAT OUR RULES

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.090
ARE AND WE'RE AND WE'RE WORKING

00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:07.459
VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.261
WE ARE MAXIMIZING OUR UTILITY

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.497
OF STATE DOLLARS IN TERMS OF

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:16.368
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH. WE

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:17.035
CHALLENGES IN THE CENTRAL

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:18.537
VALLEY OR A PLACES WHERE FOR.

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:22.341
ARE NEED TO. ARTS CENTER COAST

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:24.476
WHERE FOLKS NEED TO GET TO WORK

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.012
THEY ONLY HAVE OLDER VEHICLES

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.513
THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.048
MOBILITY OPTIONS BUT I WOULD

00:17:30.115 --> 00:17:31.917
SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE-

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:35.687
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING- A SHIFT

00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:37.689
IN THE A REGULATORY. THE

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:38.824
REGULATIONS AROUND TRANSIT

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.093
BUSES SO THOSE HAVE TO BE

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.896
ELECTRIC. AND THE THERE IS AN

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:46.265
OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO- TO

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.267
FOCUS MORE OF OUR ATTENTION ON

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.303
LAST MILE BETWEEN. BETWEEN THE

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.338
WHERE THE BUS DROPS YOU OFF AND

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.207
WHERE YOU NEED TO GET TO AGAIN

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.708
THIS NEED TO BE A COLLABORATION

00:17:56.775 --> 00:17:58.744
WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD-

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:00.212
BECAUSE THERE'S A- THERE'S A

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.181
VEHICLES COMPONENT TO THAT. BUT

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:03.749
WE'RE THINKING THROUGH MORE SO

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.918
HOW DO WE OPTIMIZE WHERE WE PUT

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:08.053
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.223
WE CAN. INSURE IT SMACKS ME TO

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.157
LEAVE IT ALSO THAT IT COULD

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:13.992
SUPPORT POTENTIALLY THIS LAST

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:18.564
FILE- I DO THINK THOUGH WE WILL

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.566
NEED TO CAN TO FOCUS ON. YOU

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:21.166
KNOW THIS THERE'S A ROLE FOR

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.235
NATURAL GAS. AND ESPECIALLY

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.737
WHERE WE CAN'T EASILY ELECTRIFY

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:28.240
THERE'S A ROLE FOR. FOR FUELS

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:30.275
THAT ARE LOWER IN CARBON. EVEN

00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:33.078
IF THEY'RE STILL YOU KNOW

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:33.645
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.781
THE LEGACY FLEET. AND AGAIN I

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:37.616
THINK THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE BY

00:18:37.683 --> 00:18:40.419
POVERTY MAKES TRANSITIONING.

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.488
LOW INCOME WORKERS ARE PART

00:18:42.554 --> 00:18:45.023
TIME WORKERS TO HAVE THE SAME

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.793
OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHERS DO.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.863
IN THE FARM LABOR SETTING- SOME

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.297
FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:54.399
EMPLOYERS TO RELY ON BUSES AND

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:56.001
WE'RE CONVERTING FLEETS IN

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.637
AIRPORTS FOR A RENTAL. CAR

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:01.607
AGENCIES TO ELECTRIC- IN IT

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:02.641
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.077
TO. IN THE AGRICULTURAL ARENA

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:06.778
AS WELL THERE'S SOME GOOD

00:19:06.845 --> 00:19:07.880
MODELS OUT THERE TOO I DON'T

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:09.581
KNOW IF YOU KNOW RAYLEóN

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:10.482
WHO'S THE MAYOR IF YOU'RE ON

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:13.018
YES AND HE'S BEEN. WORKING ON

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:15.087
HOW DO WE- BASICALLY

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:16.321
ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES THAT ARE

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.891
USED TO GET. FOLKS TO MEDICAL

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.826
APPOINTMENTS AND TO WORK AND

00:19:20.893 --> 00:19:21.827
HE'S DOING SOME REALLY

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.196
INNOVATIVE. OF WORK OUT THERE

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:25.497
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:28.233
EXAMPLES. AND WE NEED TO

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.203
REPLICATE AND- EXPAND YOU KNOW

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.371
THE NUMER OF EXAMPLES OUT

00:19:32.437 --> 00:19:34.139
THERE OF WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.875
EVERYBODY- GET ACCESS TO THESE

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:37.576
VEHICLES WILL THANK YOU AND

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:38.610
THEN JUST REAL QUICKLY IN A

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.579
TRANSPORTATION SHEER AREA OF

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:43.782
EXPERTISE WE TALKED A LITTLE OF

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:48.086
THAT. OFF WIND IN JUST MAKE.

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.354
SOME BRIEF. OF HOW YOU THINK

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.857
THAT FITS IN OUR FUTURE AND-

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.559
ACHIEVING CLEAN. RENEWABLE

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.794
ENERGY GOAL HAPPY TO WELL THE

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.162
ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MEET.

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:59.097
OUR GOAL OF HAVING A 1100%

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:01.166
CLEAN GRID BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE

00:20:01.233 --> 00:20:03.068
IS TO HAVE A VERY DIVERSE SET

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:05.103
OF RESOURCES THAT WERE USING.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.205
TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY. WE'RE

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:08.440
EXCITED ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF

00:20:08.507 --> 00:20:09.775
OFF SURE WELL AFTER WIN BECAUSE

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.710
IT COMPLIMENTS SOLAR IT

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:13.812
COMPLIMENTS OF WINDS THAT

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:16.214
THAT'S DONE ON SHORE. THE AND

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:18.216
IT IT LOADS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:21.053
TIME SO THERE'S JUST MORE IT IT

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.255
IN IN TERMS OF A RESOURCE THAT

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:24.723
WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.625
OUR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:28.727
DIVERSE SET OF. SOURCES FOR

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:30.162
ELECTRICITY WE WOULD LOVE TO

00:20:30.228 --> 00:20:31.897
CAPITALIZE ON THAT AS YOU WELL

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.632

COMPLICATED I WOULD SAY- AT

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:53.712
THEIR IT IT HAVE BASE. THE DO

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:55.247
YOU GOVERNMENT HAS TEARS PAST

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.915
THREE MILES SO WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:21:56.982 --> 00:21:59.351
SURE THAT WE HAVE AN AGREMENT

00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:01.887
THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO THE

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:04.222
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ADDED OKAY

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:07.025
WELL SHOULD WE BE SUCCESSFUL AT

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.694
SOME POINT DO YOU THINK THE

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.162
LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:12.297
ESTABLISHING KIND OF A ONE STOP

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.066
SHOP KIND OF LIKE WE'VE DONE OR

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:16.702
THAT THE CDC IS DONE FOR

00:22:16.768 --> 00:22:19.237
THERMAL POWER PLANTS. HAVE YOU

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:21.506
THOUGHT ABOUT. ON I HAVEN'T

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:22.741

YOU ON THAT THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:31.583
THIS IS. OF FORWARD THINKING IN

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.652
TERMS OF WHERE WE CAN GO SO I

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.821
APPRECIATE THAT THE LAST- I

00:22:35.887 --> 00:22:37.522
THINK MY COLLEAGUES IT'S ALWAYS

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.157
GOOD TO GO LAST THEY ASK ALL

00:22:39.224 --> 00:22:41.159
THE GOOD QUESTIONS- AND THE

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:42.828
IMPORTANT ONES BUT- I WANT TO

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:45.063
ASK ABOUT THE EPIC PROGRAM AND-

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.932
THE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THIRTY

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:49.434
MILLION THAT THE COMMISSION HAS

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:51.670
THE ABILITY. TWO WOULD PUT OUT

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:54.906
THE TO THE INTEREST. GROUPS ARE

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:57.042
OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY

00:22:57.109 --> 00:23:00.212
RESEARCH TO OUR CLEAN- TO CLEAN

OUR GRID- THESE ARE RATE PAYER

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:06.184
FUNDS- I THINK IN SOME RESPECTS

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.719
THERE'S VERY FEW THAT ACTUALLY

00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:09.187
KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

00:23:09.254 --> 00:23:10.455
INCLUDING PEOPLE IN THE

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:12.591
LEGISLATURE SO. HOW ARE THESE

00:23:12.657 --> 00:23:14.459
FUNDS BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW AND

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:15.994
A AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HOW DO

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.763
YOU THINK THEY'RE SAVING RATE

00:23:17.829 --> 00:23:19.998
PAYERS MONEY. WELL I'M REALLY

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.600
EXCITED ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:22.801
THAT WE'RE MAKING- IN OUR

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:25.804
THROUGH EPIC DOLLARS. AND

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:27.105
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT IT'S REALLY

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:29.541
OPERATING AT THE CUTTING EDGE

00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.309
OF YOU KNOW BEFORE A PRE

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:33.111

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:38.316
DEVELOPMENT FROM A VERY EARLY

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:40.952
STAGE SO THAT WE CAN CAPITALIZE

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:41.853
ON THOSE CLEAN ENERGY

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.755
TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN HERE IN

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.257
CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS

00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:47.459
ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN AN ERA

00:23:47.526 --> 00:23:50.462
OF WILDFIRES AND PUBLIC SAFETY

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:52.931

MICROGRAPHS. BOGGLING FOR IT

00:23:57.636 --> 00:23:59.271
READ RANCHERIA IS A REALLY GOOD

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.205
EXAMPLE OF AN INVESTMENT THAT

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:02.874
WE SUPPORTED. YOU KNOW THEY- IN

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:06.211
THE LAST. THE SORT OF FIRES IN

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.713
THIS LAST YEAR. THEY REPORTED

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.249
THAT 10% OF ALL HUMBOLDT

00:24:11.316 --> 00:24:13.985
RESIDENTS. USE THE SERVICES AT

00:24:14.052 --> 00:24:16.188
THE RENTERIA. AND THAT THEY

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:17.789
SAVED FOR LIVES. THOSE ARE THE

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.157
KINDS OF INVESTMENTS WE WANT TO

MAKE SURE. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE.

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:24.496
TO SUPPORT A MORE RESILIENT

00:24:24.563 --> 00:24:26.631
ENERGY SYSTEM- WE'RE ALSO

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:27.933
LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGIES THAT

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:30.068
CAN ISLAND HOMES SO THAT YOU

00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.536
CAN WITH THE POWER SHUT OFF TO

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:32.838
YOU CAN STILL USE YOUR- SOLAR

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:34.506
AND YOU CAN. CONTINUE TO USE

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:38.577
ELECTRICITY- BUT THE THIS IS IN

00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:41.313
MY MIND AWAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:44.316
GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY. AT AT

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:45.750
IN A LEADERSHIP ROLE NOT JUST

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:46.585
HERE IN UNITED STATES BUT

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:51.690
GLOBALLY. ON. CLEAN ENERGY IT

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:55.827

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:56.561
THAT HELP US MAKE SURE WE CAN

00:24:56.628 --> 00:24:57.662

EPIC DAHLE. TO INVEST IN SOME.

00:24:59.397 --> 00:25:02.400
ADVOCATE AS A NOTED BEFORE. AT

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:03.768
IF WE DO IT RIGHT SAVE MONEY WE

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.570

DO A RIGHT AND WE WANT TO MAKE

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:08.373
THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS SO THAT

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.507
WE CAN CAPITALIZE ON THIS

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:12.377
VEHICLE TO GRID. INTEGRATION WE

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:14.579
FUNDED OVER TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:16.615
BUSES THAT ARE ELECTRIC AND

00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:18.016
THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL NOT

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.651
JUST TO ACTUALLY GIVE

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:20.785
ELECTRICITY BACK TO THE GRID IS

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:23.388
CALLED VGA OR VEHICLE TO GRID.

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:25.023
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT USING SOME

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.524
OF OUR EPIC DOLLARS TO

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:27.959
CAPITALIZE ON THE POTENTIAL TO

00:25:28.026 --> 00:25:29.261
DO DEMONSTRATION ABOUT WHAT HOW

00:25:29.327 --> 00:25:30.462
DO WE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DO

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:32.597
THIS. HOW DO WE USE SCHOOL

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.332
BUSES AS A RESOURCE WHEN THE

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:36.368
GRID GET GOES DOWN. AND SCHOOL

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:37.769
BUSES ARE PARTICULARLY ENTICING

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:40.672
BECAUSE THEY'RE CHARGED- YOU

FORMATION GROUP- AND THESE ARE

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.132
STRINGENT STANDARDS WE'RE GOING

MEET WITH FAIRLY STRINGENT

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:04.600
REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:07.370
PUBLIC BANK LAW INCLUDING- FDIC

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:10.539
INSURANCE- WHICH WHICH IS NO

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:14.744
SMALL FEAT- AND- AND THEY WOULD

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:18.147
HAVE TO SECURE A FEASIBILITY

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:20.549
STUDY SHOWING THAT- SHOWING

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:23.085
THAT THEIR BUSINESS PLAN CAN

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:26.455
SUCCEED OVER THE LONG TERM. I

01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:30.660
FRANKLY DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE.

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:33.696
ENOUGH INFORMATION TO FORM AN

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:36.032
INDEPENDENT OPINION AS TO

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.266
WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD THIN

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.401
WHETHER THIS IS A BAD THING

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:40.036
FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW THAT MY

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.170
OPINION ON THE MATTER IS ALL

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:42.438
THAT MATERIAL WHAT I WOULD SAY

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:44.607
IS. I THINK SOME OF THOSE

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:47.276
PROSPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS- WE'LL

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.477
HAVE TO CLEAR OF THE FAIRLY

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:51.747
HIGH BAR. HOW DID THE- HER

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:55.751
PENSION. FACTOR INTO CAPITAL

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.286
AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:58.854
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEEK TO

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:02.892
FORM OF PUBLIC BANK. I THINK

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:03.826
THAT I THINK THAT HAS A

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.862
FANTASTIC QUESTION AND THE

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:10.599
SHORT ANSWER IS. I DON'T

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.668
EXACTLY KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:16.005
GOING TO BE ON THE THAT WILL BE

01:06:16.072 --> 01:06:18.341
LARGELY IN THE ONUS OF THE

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:22.111
LOCAL. THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.512
HI THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.147
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO FIGURING

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.550
OUT THEIR THEIR OUTSTANDING

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.085
PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND HOW

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:31.487
BEST TO BALANCE THOSE

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.723
OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES AGAINST

01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:35.024
SOME OF THE CAPITAL

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.927
REQUIREMENTS ON WITH RESPECT TO

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.596
PUBLIC THANK APPLICATION. SO

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.298
THE SHORT ANSWER IS. IT'S HARD

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.800
TO SAY WITH GREAT SPECIFICITY

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.702
BUT IT'S ALSO HARD TO IMAGINE

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.571
THAT OUTSTANDING PENSION

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:51.273
OBLIGATIONS WOULD. MAKE IT EASY

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.908
FOR PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS TO

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:55.111
ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE

01:06:55.177 --> 01:06:57.113
CAPITAL RESERVED FOR A FOR A

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.348
NEW BANK CHARTER WILL NOT NOT

CARRIED ON A BALLOT SHEET

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:07.156
SOMEWHERE- AND THAT SORT OF

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:07.923
BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.626

BY SOMEONE IN DETERMINING AS
