MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE -- AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM -- SO WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR ALL MEMBERS TO PLEASE JOIN US IN ROOM ONE TWENTY SIX BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM. WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE I SEE MR BLOOM IS HERE. FIRST ON THE LIST FILE ITEM THREE A. B.. SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE MR BLOOM WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- THIS BILL WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON THEM. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL ALLOW NONPROFIT PUBLIC PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATIONS TO SELL BONDS THAT OUR STATE INCOME TAXEXEMPT TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS I NEED TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS WE NEED AND HOW. HOW HAVE NEVER HEARD ABOUT ANY SORT OF ALL HOUSING BUT -- AB SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE LIKE MANY OF THE BILLS THAT ARE MOVING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE -- IN THIS SESSION OFFER A SOLUTION NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION BUT A SOLUTION. OF THE BILL WILL ALLOW THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES TO CREATE THE STATE'S FIRST HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION A SELF SUSTAINING LOCAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. THE LA HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION WILL SELL TAX. IT WILL SELL STATE INCOME TAX EXEMPT BONDS AT BELOW MARKET RATE. BOND PROCEEDS WILL THEN FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND BE USED TO OFFER BELOW MARKET RATE MORTGAGES TO LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME HOME BUYERS. REPAYMENTS ON MORTGAGE LOANS WILL BE USED TO PAY FOR THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS AND FINANCE THE AGENCIES OVERHEAD COSTS. EXCESS REVENUE WILL FIND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS IN LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME HOME BUYERS. NEW YORK AND RHODE ISLAND'S FINANCING CORPORATIONS HAVE SHOWN MAJOR SUCCESSES IN BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S WHY WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. NEW YORK CITY'S HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS FINANCED OVER A HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS AND PLANS TO PRODUCE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BY. TWENTY TWENTY SIX PRETTY AMBITIOUS BUT IT'S THE KIND OF AMBITION THAT WE NEED HERE IN CALIFORNIA RHODE ISLAND HAS FINANCED OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNITS. AND HAS HELPED OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND FAMILIES BY THEIR HOMES AB SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL HELP THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR THE SUCCESSES OF NEW YORK AND RHODE ISLAND BY PROVIDING NONPROFIT AGENCIES. A TOOL TO ADDRESS OUR CONTINUED HOUSING CRISIS. THE AGENCY WILL FIND A PROJECTED ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS AND ADDITIONALLY THE SELF SUSTAINING MODEL DOESN'T. NOT REQUIRE INVESTMENTS FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR ANY TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AB SIXTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL BE A TOOL FOR CITIES TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE OF THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SYLVIA STRAW IS HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND DISCUSS THE BILL FURTHER AN ANSWER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. FOR THE C. LOS ANGELES HELLO GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SELL THIS ALISHA ON BEHALF OF CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI -- WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK AND FOR THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- WE THINK THIS IS A VERY INNOVATIVE SOLUTION -- BASED ON THE NEW YORK MODEL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM DESCRIBED -- THIS BY HOUSING FINANCE CORPORATION WOULD WORK ALONG WITH OUR OTHER -- LOCALS AS FUNDING MEASURES SUCH AS PROP HHH FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING ARE LINKAGE FEE AND WE EXPECT THAT THIS AGENCY WILL LEVERAGE PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKET INVESTMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE FIRST YEAR AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED UNITS THE SECOND YEAR. AND GRADUALLY SCALING UP TO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS PER YEAR AFTER FIVE YEARS OF OPERATION -- AS A SELF GOVERNING INDEPENDENT AGENCY -- THIS WILL BE WILL BE ITS OWN ENTITY SEPARATE FROM THE CITY. AND THE UNIQUE STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSING AGENCY WILL ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE EVERY DOLLAR OF BONDS ISSUED TO TO CREATE TWELVE FIFTY OF AFFORDABLE. HOUSING -- SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS INNOVATIVE AMBITIOUS TOOL THANK YOU. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THEY WISH TO SUPPORT THIS. ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC. WANT TO OPPOSE THIS. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS MISTER GLORIA JUST A QUICK CLARIFYING QUESTION I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER BUT GIVEN THE SPONSOR THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT'S OF RESTRICTED SCOPE TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES CRACKED. SO THIS WOULD BE STATEWIDE. OF IMPACT WE HAVE -- SOME TOOLS LIKE THIS IN SAN DIEGO -- BACKING TO EXPRESS CONNECTION -- FOR THE OPENING UP OF IT MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR FOLKS AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE SCOPE OF THE BILL -- HAPPY WITH IT WHEN THE TIME COMES. THANK YOU. BUT SORT OF THANK THE AUTHOR FOR A BRING IN ANOTHER INNOVATIVE SOLUTION -- MOVING AFFORD I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY THE CITY OF LA BUT HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE SOME BROADER IMPACTS AND I HAVE A BILL THAT -- THE CHAIR OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS -- SUPPORTED THAT WOULD ALLOW US IN THE BAY AREA TO MOVE FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HOUSING ENTITY BUT I THINK WE ALL NEED DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO. TO DRESS A CRISIS AND APPRECIATE YOU. MOVING THIS FOR ALSO APPRECIATE YOU TAKING A MAN'S TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INSURING OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY AND AT THE RIGHT TIME I WILL ALSO ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO SUPPORT THE SOME OF IT. FOR BIGGEST SHARE THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE TO MISS AGUIAR-CURRY FILE ITEM ONE AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT INSURES THE TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES WHICH ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS SACRED SITES WILL NOT BE DESTROYED UNDER THE NEW STREAMLINED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT LAW. THESE TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES CAN BE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES FEATURES OR RELIGIOUS OBJECTS JUST TO NAME A FEW WE HAVE LOST MUCH OF OUR STATES NATIVE HISTORY AND ONCE RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL ARTIFACT SITE A BURIAL GROUND IS LOST IT CANNOT BE REPLACED. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS TOWARD PROTECTING AND RESPECTING TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES. AB FIFTY TWO WHICH BECAME LAW IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CAR REQUIRES CONSULTATION BY LEAD AGENCIES UNDERSEA QUIRK WITH TRIBES THAT HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE AREA OF A PROPOSED PROJECT. THERE IS OFTEN NO REASON WHY DEVELOPER MAY KNOW THAT A PROJECT SITE IS A PLACE OF TRIBAL CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE. WITH CONSULTATION TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCE CAN BE PROTECTED OR VIA AVOIDED AND IMPACTS CAN BE MITIGATED. DEVELOPMENT CAN ACTUALLY MOVE FASTER WITH CONSULTATION BECAUSE LITIGATION IS LESS NECESSARY AS A MEANS OF PROTECTION FOR THE TRIBES. SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH BECAME LAW LAST YEAR DID NOT INCLUDE TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES IN ITS LIST OF PROTECTED RESOURCES WE ASSUME THIS IS JUST A SIMPLE OVERSIGHT. WHAT I SICK WITH THIS BILL IS TO PROTECT THE REQUIREMENT FOR CONSULTATION WITH TRIBES WHOSE RESOURCES MAY BE VULNERABLE TO A PROPOSED PROJECT? THIS IS CLARIFIED BY THE AMENDMENT I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT FROM THE COMMITTEE. AB ONE SIXTY EIGHT IN SUMMARY AS TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCE TO THE LIST OF EXEMPTIONS UNDER SB. THIRTY FIVE TO ENSURE THE TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO UNWITTING DESECRATION IN OUR WERE THE FIGHT TO CREATE MORE HOUSING. WE CONSULTED WITH SENATOR WIENERS OFFICE PRIOR TO INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL AND A CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS MICHELLE A LOW PAYMENT. THE PENA IN AFRICA FARGAS. YOUR WITNESSES. A GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT BILL I HAD HOPED TO HAVE THIS LAST YEAR BUT IT WAS A WE WERE UNABLE TO GET IT INCLUDED IN THE LAW AND THE AMENDMENTS TO SB THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR -- AS THEY ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID THE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN OVERSIGHT AND SB THIRTY FIVE THE STREAMLINING BILL. BECAUSE TRIBES HAVE AND THEIR ADVOCATES OF WORK FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW. TO GET SOME PROTECTIONS IN LAW FOR TRIBAL CULTURAL SITES CULTURAL PLACES BURIAL GROUNDS -- AND IT'S MOST RECENTLY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY FIFTEEN WE NEGOTIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT. ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTATIVES AND THE LEGISLATORS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS TO GET AB FIFTY TWO PASSED AND AB FIFTY TWO WAS. A PROCESS WHERE DEVELOPERS COULD BE IN CONSULTATION WITH CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES THAT HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THESE PLACES AND WHAT WAS UNDER THE GROUND -- NOT TO BE FLIP BUT I WAS THINKING ON THE WAY HERE ABOUT OF THE MOVIE POLTERGEIST RIGHT WHERE EVERYBODY SEEN POLTERGEIST IN THE AT THAT YOU FIND OUT AT THE END OF THE MOVIE THIS THERE'S A BURIAL GROUND UNDER THE HOUSING SUBDIVISION. AND THAT IS A PROBLEM AND THAT'S FICTION RIGHT THAT'S THE MOVIES IT'S IN THE MOVIES BUT THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT TODAY WERE TRYING TO PREVENT. PEOPLE FROM KNOWINGLY BUILDING ON THESE CULTURAL PLACES THAT AFFECT TRADITIONAL CULTURAL VALUES -- WE DO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING GREATLY BECAUSE MANY OF THE CALIFORNIA TRIBES ARE LOW INCOME FOLKS AND NEED LOW INCOME HOUSING IN THESE URBAN AREAS -- AND WE DO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS WE JUST ASK THAT AB FIFTY TO BE RECOGNIZED AND FOLLOWED. ADAM AND THE WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT IS TO HAVE THE EXEMPTION -- WORKED INTO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

DO THE INCREASED COST OF THE LINK THE APPROVAL PROCESS AS A NONPROFIT BUILDER IT'S COSTING HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE EACH YEAR JUST TO DO THE SAME THING IN TERMS OF PROVIDING HOMES. THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP RAISE MORE FROM PRIVATE INVESTORS AND LEVERAGE MORE FUNDING.
