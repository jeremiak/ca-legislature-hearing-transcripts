SO THOSE ARE THE CHANGES TO THE AGENDA AND WE WILL BEGIN NOW WITH SIMPLY MEMBER MARK STONE ITEM. ONE EIGHTY FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS AB FORTY FIVE IS A BILL THAT WOULD REMOVE. THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE AND LOCAL JAIL STATE PRISONS AND LOCAL JAILS IN CHARGE COPAYS AND DURABLE MEDICAL. HAS A GENESIS FROM LAST YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT MEDICAL PROVISIONS IN JAILS HAVE BEEN AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE WE WANT THINGS WE DISCOVERED WAS CHARGING A FIVE DOLLAR COPAY. FOR SOMEONE WHO MAKES EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR JUST IS UNCONSCIONABLE. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT OR HAVE ALREADY ABANDON THE PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY FOUNDED THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FAR EXCEED. THE THE COST TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM AND THE REALLY VERY LITTLE BENEFITS. TO CHARGING SOMEBODY A COPAY LIKE WE LIKE WE DO OUT IN THE REGULAR MARKET. WHEN THEY ARE CAPTIVE IN PRISONS WHEN THEY HAVE NO OTHER PLACE TO GO AND IN FACT THAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN EACH OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WILL NOTE THAT CHARGING THAT COPAY? IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO INMATES GETTING PROPER MEDICAL CARE THEY WILL OFTEN WAIT UNTIL THE PROBLEM BECOMES A CUTE. N. WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CHARGED A CO PAY IN ORDER TO GET THE MEDICAL HELP THAT THEY NEED. ACT WHEN TALKING WITH CDC ARE ABOUT THIS THESE THESE THE PRACTICE AS OF MARCH FIRST OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT THIS WAS NOT. SOMETHING THAT WAS WORKING THE WAY THAT HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO WORK. AND WHAT THE BILL BEFORE US DOES IS REMOVE THE STATUE TO STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO CHARGE COPAYS IN THE FUTURE. AND APPLIES TO THE COUNTIES TO LOCAL JAILS BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED GET THE MEDICAL HELP THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT AS THEY NEED IT. RATHER THAN HAVING TO WAIT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I'VE. THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RON MARYLAND RALSTON AND I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR PRIDE DEGREE BROWN A CAL STATE UNIVERSITY FULLERTON. AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS THE HIGHER EDUCATION AND SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION OF THE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. AND A LONG TIME MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS. A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION THAT ADVOCATES FOR WOMEN. GENDER NON CONFORMING AND TRANS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. AS WELL AS A FORM INCARCERATED PERSON SENTENCED TO LIFE. WHO SPENT TWENTY THREE YEARS AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN IN CORONA? I AM HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL FORTY FIVE BY SHARE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEONE WHO HAD TO ACCESS CARE. AND AS AN ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE WITH BARRIERS TO ACCESSING CARE. LIKE MANY OF YOU DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETIES I WITNESSED CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION INCREASED BY 5100%. ARRIVING AT THE PRISON AT AGE. TWENTY FOUR THERE ARE WOMEN HOUSE INTO PERSON SALES. SLEEPING IN BOILER ROOM STAY ROOMS. FOUR YEAS AND THE AUDITORIUM. THE SITUATION WITH AND HUMANE AND UNHEALTHY. INCARCERATED WOMEN WHO WERE NOT RECEIVING THE PROPER CARE AND WAREHOUSE AND DEFICIENT PRISON CONDITIONS. THEN PAROLE IN BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. ELIMINATING COPAYS IS GOOD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. MOST WOMEN INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM HAVING EXPERIENCED YEARS. OF PHYSICAL MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA WITH LITTLE MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT WHILE INCARCERATED [inaudible] THEREFORE ACCESSING. HEALTHCARE IS ESSENTIAL THIS MEANS FREE HEALTHCARE. WOMEN ARE THE MAJORITY OF PRIMARY CARE GIVERS AND ONE THING CAR SERRATED. MOST FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT SOCIAL OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND DEPENDED UPON THE STATE. THIS IS MY SITUATION. AS A MOTHER OF TWO BOYS THREE AND FIVE YEARS OLD. I DESPERATELY TRIED TO STAY IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. THROUGHOUT MY YEARS IN PRISON I HELD MANY WORK IN VOCATIONAL POSITIONS WHICH EARNED BETWEEN ZERO PAY AND THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AN HOUR. HOWEVER MY AVERAGE. EARNING CAPACITY WAS TWENTY TO THIRTY SIX DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE A COPAY REPRESENTS A DANGEROUS BAY AREA TO ACCESS AND HEALTHCARE. AND TO KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A CHRONIC ILLNESS WHICH REQUIRED MORE OF IT IS TO THE PRISON CLINIC AND LOCAL HOSPITAL. MANY TIMES WHILE IN PAIN I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIN IN A BIRTHDAY GIFT OR CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO MY KIDS. AND PURCHASING TOOTHPASTE LAUNDRY SOAP OTHER PERSONAL CARE ITEMS. OR A GROWING MORE DEATH. AS SOMEONE WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER. I WAS ALWAYS SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS AND SICKNESS. SO EVEN THOUGH SEEKING A DOCTOR WITH RISKY AND PUT MY HEALTH IN DANGER I HAD TO DO IT. MY LIFE MY SURVIVAL REQUIRED CONSTANT CARE. GOING TO THE DOCTOR IN PRISON IS STRESSFUL. THE MEANING AND STRIPS PEOPLE OF THEIR HUMAN DIGNITY AND RIGHT TO PRIVACY. MANY TIMES I WAS SUBJECTED TO GROUP STRIPS THIRTIETH DOING THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING. AN ISOLATED AREAS OF THE PRISON. SOME MAY ARGUE THAT ELIMINATING COPAYS COULD LEAD TO ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SEEK MEDICAL VISITS FOR THE WRONG REASONS. I NOR ANYONE I EVER KNEW DESIRE TO STAND NAKED BEFORE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. AND OTHER INCARCERATED PEOPLE LIFTING AND SEPARATING BODY PARTS WHILE SICK AND IN PAIN. JEFF TO GET OUT OF A JAIL SALE OR A PRISON DOOR. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU. APOLOGIES BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THE NEXT WITNESS SOMEONE ESTABLISH A QUORUM OKAY. COULD YOU DO ROLL CALL SKINNER. HERE MORE LIKE PRESENT OR LUCK HERE BRADFORD YOU'RE RIGHT FOR YOUR JACKSON HERE JACKSON HERE MITCHELL. MORALE -- OUT HERE WINNER. I'M WILL GO. WE HAVE A MOTION NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S JOSEPH CALDERON. AND I'M A SENIOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER FOR THE TRANSITIONS CLICK NETWORK I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL. FORTY FIVE THE TRANSITIONS CLINIC NETWORK IS A NATIONAL NETWORK OF MEDICAL HOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES RECENTLY RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION. FOUNDED ON THE IDEA THAT THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM ARE CLOSEST TO THE SOLUTION. AND EACH CLINIC ADOPTS THE TRANSITIONS CLICK PROGRAM IN PLACE A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER WITH THE HISTORY FROM CAR SERRATION AS A PART OF THE CLINICAL TEAM. BEING A MEDICAL EXPERT WORKING WITH RETURNING COMMUNITY MEMBERS I HAVE SEEN SAD STORIES ON WINE. BECAUSE PEOPLE PASSED UP HEALTH CARE TO PAY FOR BASIC NECESSITIES LIKE TOTALLY TREASON FOOD. PEOPLE IN PRISON ARE AMONG THE SICKEST MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY PLEASE LET US KNOW THAT. THEY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASES HIGHER RATES OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND 65285% HAVE A HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE USE. AND ABUSE. ON AVERAGE THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE RETURNING FROM PRISON MANY OF WHOM HAD HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC EN CAMINO WILL DISEASES AND SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE. WHICH EQUALS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. REQUIRING A COPAY FOR A CURSORY PEOPLE PUTS THEIR HEALTH AT RISK. MANY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN RETURNING HOME FROM PRISON COME FROM COMMUNITIES THAT HISTORICALLY DID NOT HAVE HEALTH CARE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE THEY HEALTH INEQUITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. I CAME FROM ONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THE ONLY THING I KNOW ABOUT MEDICAL CARE WAS WITH TO GET SHOTS FOR SCHOOL AND WATCHED LOVED ONES DYING. POVERTY TRAPS HEALTH IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. I UNDERSTAND PASSING UP TO DOCTOR. SO I CAN EAT. BY ELIMINATING THE COPAY AB FORTY FIVE WILL HELP IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAVOR SYSTEM MONEY. BY ADDRESSING THE MEDICAL ISSUES EARLIER AS OPPOSED TO LATER BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT WILL SAVE LIVES. I WATCHED PEOPLE DIE OF TREATABLE DISEASES LIKE MY FRIEND WHO TURNED GREEN AND WAS WHEELED AWAY TO DIE BECAUSE OF BAD POLICIES. FAIR AND JUST ACCESS THE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON A. B. FORTY FIVE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THEY CAN COME UP TO THAT MIKE.

HARD TO WE HAVE -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE LET'S HAVE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MORNING MANAGER MEMBERS COREY CELLS ALONG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL RESPECTFULLY -- THERE IS NO DESIRE TO PREVENT OR DENY MEDICAL CARE TO ANY INMATES -- IN THE BASIS OF OUR POSITION TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THAT BEING SAID -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT REMOVING THE ABILITY NOT THE REQUIREMENT BUT THE ABILITY TO CHARGE THIS MODEST COPAY -- EVEN UNDERSTANDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU FOR DESCRIBED BY THE WITNESSES I CAN SERVE AS A DETERRENT TO FRIVOLOUS SEEKING OF MEDICAL ATTENTION -- THERE ARE EXISTING PROTECTIONS IN STATUTE WITH WHICH WHICH WE THINK. STRIKE THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE THE LOSS SAYS ALREADY NO PERSON THAT YOU MAY NOT BE CHARGED IF YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDS IN YOUR ACCOUNT. YOU MAY NOT BE DENIED CARE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDS THAT THE MEDICAL PROVIDER IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IS PERMITTED TO WAIVE THE FEE. AND ANY FOLLOW UP VISITS AT THE DIRECTION OF THE MEDICAL PROVIDER MUST BE PROVIDED WITHOUT A FEE SO WE BELIEVE THERE ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS IN THE CASES WHERE THE FEE IS -- ALLOWED AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK YOU KNOW WHAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT -- IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS YES SENATOR JACKSON -- THE NOTION WE PAY THESE PEOPLE EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR IS REALLY WERE I KIND OF WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THIS I DON'T WANT PEOPLE. MAKING A COAL PAY IN ADDRESSING WHEN I THINK OF FRANKLY PROBABLY MORE PHANTOM ISSUES YOU KNOW. THERE MAY BE LAWS THAT SAY THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN PRISON AFTER WE TAKE CARE BUT WE FOR TOO MANY HORROR STORIES WHEN IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THE QUESTION IS WHY DON'T WE PAY PEOPLE -- I'M NOT SAYING IT TO PAYING FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. BUT EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR I MEAN IN SOME INSTANCES NOTHING. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD PEOPLE UP SO THEY CAN FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES WHEN THEY GO BACK TO SOCIETY THE NOTION. THAT WE WE TELL YOU THE VET YOUR VALUES EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR. IS JUST I THINK. VERY CONTRARY TO THE GOALS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE OF ALLOWING PEOPLE AS THEY EXPERIENCED LIFE INCARCERATED. TO REFLECT UPON THE POTENTIALS OF LIFE OUTSIDE OF PRISON AND TO LET THEM KNOW WE VALUE THEIR WORK. MORE THAN EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR -- IN SO -- I'M GONNA COME IN AND MOVE THIS BILL US IT'S ALREADY BEEN MOVED BUT I I THINK WE'RE LOOKIN AT THIS THE WRONG WAY I THINK THESE PEOPLE. WHO DO WORK SHOULD BE PAID AN APPROPRIATE WAGE SO THAT IF THEY ARE ASKED TO PAY A COPAY IT'S COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT OTHERS IN SOCIETY OR ASKED TO PAY -- UNTIL THEY COULD AFFORD THAT. RATHER THAN HAVE TO DECIDE THE GOING TO WAIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE SO THEY CAN GET A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR THEIR KIDS THAT THEY AREN'T ABLE TO SEE ANYWAY. I THINK THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS A MESS. AND I THINK THAT -- THE A AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS BILL BUT IT'S DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM. YOU KNOW KIND OF AS IT IS AND MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD IS FIGURE OUT A WAY WHICH THAT WERE THEORETICALLY SAVING A LOT OF MONEY. BY CLOSING DOWN THESE PRISONS AND A REDUCING ARC ARE RUN -- THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR IN OUR STATE PRISONS I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING. BUT CERTAINLY THE NOTION THAT. WE PROVIDE PEOPLE EVEN IF IT'S TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR -- SOMETHING SO THAT IF WE'RE ASKING THEM TO MAKE A CO PAY -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING. TO BE ABLE TO GET PERSONAL HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO -- AGAIN OR NO THAT'S NOT THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US BUT THE NOTION THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING TRUSTS FINE I THINK IS JUST -- IT IS PATENTLY FALSE PANDA AND I THINK THAT -- WE WE CAN A NEED TO DO BETTER IN OUR STE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE PEOPLE RUNNING IT HAVE TO TAKE A MORE HONEST. AND MORE -- CREATIVE YOU ABOUT -- THE WAY WE CONDUCT THE OUR PRISON SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S AN APP ABYSMAL FAILURE. AND PERPETUATING THOSE SAME THINGS I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP US OVERCOME THAT SO. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LUCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST AT THE LITTLE MAPS AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT SENATOR JACKSON WORKS AND AND IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR [inaudible] YOUR VOLUNTARY -- IN IN MY ANALYSIS -- MISTER CELLS YELLOW JUST MAYBE TO CONFIRM THERE'S NO MANDATE TO CHARGE THE THREE DOLLAR FEE. IF THE INMATE CANNOT PAY THE FEE THERE WILL BE NO FEE CHARGED. AN INMATE SHALL NOT BE DENIED MEDICAL CARE DUE TO THE LACK OF FUNDS. IN CASES OF AN INMATE MEDICAL EMERGENCY NO FEE MAY BE IMPOSED. FEES ARE FOR FEES FOR INMATE FOLLOW UP VISITS ARE PROHIBITED. AND ANY MONEY COLLECTED PURSUE THIS BE IS SENT TO THE COUNTY GENERAL FUND WHICH IS WHAT PAYS. FOR SHERIFF'S. DEPARTMENT ANYWAY TALK I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE FIXING IT THERE ARE THESE ALL CORRECT. YES THROUGH JR -- THOSE ARE ALL THOSE PROVISIONS THAT YOU ENUNCIATED ARE INCLUDED A PENAL CODE SECTION FOUR ZERO POINT FOUR ZERO ONE ONE POINT TWO TO DESCRIBE THE PROVISIONS ON WHEN THE C. MAY NOT BE CHARGED IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PREVENT FRIVOLOUS. CASES OF COULD YOU. ADDRESS THAT. I'M WONDERING IF INSTEAD OF ELIMINATING THE FEES SAID OKAY YOUR FIRST VISIT. IS FREE. YOUR SECOND VISIT IS A DOLLAR YOUR THIRD VISIT IS TO IN. YOUR FEW FOURTH IS -- THREE SO THAT YOU CAN. STOP THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS IS IS THAT. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE OR THROUGH THE GERMAN SOMETHING WE'D BE WILLING TO LOOK AT FOR SURE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT COLLECTING REVENUE ARE PENALIZING SOMEONE WHO IS SEEKING A MEDICAL VISIT. IT IS AGAIN A TOOL THAT EXISTS THAT IS NOT ALWAYS CHARGE AND IN SOME CASES AS AS THE OTHER POINT OUT. THERE SOME COUNTIES DON'T CHARGE THE FEE AND THEY MADE THAT DECISION FOR WHATEVER REASON AS YOU POINTED OUT IT'S NOT A MANDATORY FEE AND SO AGAIN IT EXISTS AS A TOOL THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND IF THAT SORT OF GRADUATED FEE WERE TO BE DISCUSSED I THINK WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO DISCUSS THAT SORT OF OPTION AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGES. WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT VARIABLES IN THE SYSTEM AND THIS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THAT AND THIS ONE PIECE IS BEING ADDRESSED BY MANY OTHER THINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED. THANK YOU -- CINNAMON STONE IS THAT MAKES. ERRORS THAT NOT [inaudible] DEBATABLE NO THE END EVEN TO SENATOR JACKSON'S COMMENT. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW COPAYS WORK FOR US OUTSIDE. IT'S MAKING SURE WE'RE PUTTING SOME SKIN IN THE GAME WE HAVE A MEDICAL VISIT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THAT'S ABOUT. WHEN YOU'RE INSIDE THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT CALCULATION BECAUSE NO PLACE ELSE TO GO YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE? AND EVEN IF WE RAISE THE RATES WHICH I WOULD AGREE EIGHT CENTS AN HOUR IS IT. IS A BIT EMBARRASSING THAT'S WHERE THE STRUCTURE IS AN FOR WILLING TO PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT. IN FACT THE PRISON SYSTEM IS NOT. WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY THE PRISM YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR BECAUSE OF INCREASING COSTS WE'RE NOT YET CLOSING PRISONS IT'S DIFFERENT TOPIC THAT SOME THAT WE ULTIMATELY NEED TO DO. BUT UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM. EITHER WE FIND A WAY TO PAY THESE FOLKS A LOT MORE IN THE BUDGET WHICH WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE AND I DON'T SEE THAT COMING. OR WE WE SORT OF SHIFT WHAT THE WHAT THE INCENTIVES ARE IN THE SHARES THAT I'VE TALKED. TO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL VISITS. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY DATA ABOUT WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS OR HOW MANY PEOPLE COME FORWARD WITH. THEY CLAIM TO BE FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL VISITS. I'VE TOLD THEM THAT IF THIS MOVES FORWARD AND THEY START SEEING AN INCREASE IN THAT IF WE CAN EVEN TO FIND IT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OTHER TOOLS THAT THEY CAN USE. TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. THEY DO SAID CALLS THEY DO TRIAGE THEY HAVE OTHER TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL BECAUSE THIS IS A CAPTIVE POPULATION. SO JUST FUNDAMENTALLY CHARGING THEM ANYTHING FOR HEALTH CARE DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY AND IT PHILOSOPHICALLY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER INSIDE EVEN IF WE ADDRESS. THE PRISON PAY. AND THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THAT THIS THIS NOTION THIS FEAR ABOUT ABOUT FRIVOLOUS VISITS BUT I WILL ALSO TELL YOU IN TALKING TO THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN PRISONS AND IN JAILS. THEY DON'T SEE IT THE SAME WAY AT ALL THEY SEE A CO PAY JUST AS AN ABSOLUTE BARRIER AND THEY DON'T SEE THAT THESE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE TREATING THESE PATIENTS. THEY DON'T SEE THESE FRIVOLOUS AS IT'S THEY DON'T THEY'RE TELLING ME THAT THIS IS NOT. A PROBLEM IN THEIR MINDS. SO IF WE THINK THAT PUTTING A CO PLACE IN PLACE A COPAY PLACE IS GOING. TO IS THE BARRIER TO THAT THE FRIVOLOUS MEDICAL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE. AND YET THERE'S NOT REALLY A JUSTIFIABLE REASON FOR IT OTHER THAN WE HAVE TO PAY ON THE OUTSIDE YOU SHOULD PAID ON THE INSIDE. THAT KIND OF FALLS A LITTLE BIT THIN GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE INSIDE AND AND WE'RE NOT. SO THE WHOLE PHILOSOPHICAL THING OF PUTTING THIS ON THEM. BABY FEELS GOOD BABY CRITICISM EVEN MORE WE HAVE TO DO IT SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT. BUT THOSE AREN'T RATIONAL HEALTH REASONS THOSE AREN'T RATIONAL POLICY REASONS WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING AT YES BITS AND PIECES AT A TIME. BUT FUNCTIONING THE BEST THAT IT CAN AND TAKING DOWN BARRIERS. TO MEDICAL ACCESS. SO I COME FROM A SUPERMAJORITY BACKGROUND AND AB ONE OH NINE SHOWS UP AND I THINK. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN ONE OF THE THE STAGGERING A REMARKABLE THINGS THAT WE DISCOVERED IS HOW MANY INMATES. WERE WERE BROUGHT DOWN TO THE JAIL SYSTEM. THAT HAD SEVERE MEDICAL ISSUES ON WE WE FOUND OUR COSTS INCREASED BECAUSE OF A SAID WE HAD LIVER TRANSPLANTS AND ALL KINDS OF ISSUES. SO I CAN KIND OF SEE WHERE SOME SERVICE ARE GOING TO SAY WAIT A SECOND I WE'VE GOT. TO MONITOR OUR COST SO THAT'S SORT OF THE CONTEXT OF IT BUT THE ONES LIKE SOME LARGER COUNTIES LIKE SANTA CLARA THEY HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN YEARS BECAUSE THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM. OUTWEIGH THE COSTS OF WHAT THEY'RE COLLECTING SO AGAIN THEN IT'S JUST BACK TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL YOU DO A BECAUSE WE DO IT. I BROUGHT THIS UP WITH -- I'VE THREE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT SO SANTA CLARA WAS ONE SANTA CRUZ WAS MAKING ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND WHEN I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THEM. THEY THEIR GRUMBLING ABOUT IT BUT THEY JUST STOP CHARGING COPAYS THEY REALIZE THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT SILLY MONTEREY HAS PUSHED BACK A LITTLE BIT AND THEIR CONCERN WAS EXACTLY THE ISSUE ABOUT FRIVOLOUS. VISITS AND THAT'S WHY I TALKED THEM AND I COMMITTED TO THEM THAT IF YOU ARE SEEING THAT SHOW ME THE DATA LET'S TALK ABOUT OTHER WAYS WE CAN DO AND IF I CAN HELP. I'M HAPPY TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THINGS IN PLACE OR ALLOWING THEM TO PUT PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO TRIAGE DID THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING. INMATES INTO MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THOSE THE MEDICAL BEDS FILLED UP FOR THOSE DOCTORS BUSY WITH CASES THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO SEE THAT'S THAT'S A MEDICAL ISSUE AS WELL. BUT AGAIN THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE TELLING ME BOTH OF THE LOCAL LEVEL THE STATE LEVEL THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SEE. MAKE YOUR SHERMAN NEVER STONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. CERTAINLY THERE ARE WE HAVE A MOTION -- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSE THAT A COUNTY HAS TO GO THROUGH BOTH TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PERSON COURT IN THE COUNTY JAIL HAS THE MEANS EVEN TO COVER THE COST. AND SO FIRST YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS AND THEN EVEN TRYING TO COLLECT -- THIS SEEMS TO ME -- A A BARRIER THAT IS DOES NOT HAVE AS THE AUTHOR PORTRAYED. EIGHT ILLEGITIMATE LOGIC -- AND IF WE LOOK AT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IN THIS I KNOW THAT THE PURPOSE IS NOT TO MINIMIZE COSTS BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUE. REFERENED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC STATUS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR IF THE FOLKS WHO SERVE IN OUR COUNTY JAILS. THERE ARE FROM LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS THEY HAVE THEY DID NOT COME INTO JAIL AS BY AND LARGE AS EITHER MIDDLE CLASS OR WEALTHY PEOPLE. SO. THAT JUST BY CORRELATION THEY PROBABLY DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE EVEN PRIOR TO GETTING INTO COUNTY JAIL SO JUST GIVEN OUR HEALTH SYSTEM WITHOUT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE. SO THEY ALREADY PROBABLY HAD BUILT UP HEALTH AND MEDICAL NEEDS -- IT'S JUST ANOTHER FEATURE OF ARE UNFORTUNATE -- SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOWER INCOME HAVE MUCH LESS ACCESS TO MANY -- SERVICES SO I THINK YOUR BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE -- WE HAVE A MOTION YOU CAN CLOSE ON OUR CALL THE ROLL. I JUST ASK YOUR ITEM THANK YOU. ROLL CALL. AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS. TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MORLOCK. MORE LIKE I BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MORALE. AROUND NOW WINNER WIENER AYE. I WILL HOLD THE BILL ON CALL BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME ABSENT MEMBERS -- BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER HUMAN IN. YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL SO I AM GOING TO PASSED THE GAVEL. TO MY VICE CHAIR. THEY HAVE TO PRESENT AT ANOTHER COMMITTEE -- BUT WE WILL THANK YOU. THE CHAIR AB NINE SIXTY FIVE IS A BILL THAT. BRINGS TOGETHER THE THE WAY THAT PRISONERS CAN. OBTAIN CREDITS. BOTH UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND THEN YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE CREDITS. THE BENEFIT OF THE CREDIT SYSTEM IS IT'S A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE INSIDE ARE. TAKING THE COURSE IS DOING THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT LED THEM INTO PRISON IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE KNOW WHEN THESE PROGRAMS WORK. THEY CAN THEIR SERIOUS FACTORS IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM THROUGHOUT THE POPULATION. THE CHALLENGES AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHERE PROPERTY SEVEN WAS SET UP. WAS TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE COURSES TO DO THINGS AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE. AT OPPORTUNITY FOR EARLIER PAROLE DATE. MS WE HAVE A SEPARATE SECOND SYSTEM THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE SYSTEM. AND THE WAY THAT PROP FIFTY SEVEN CREDITS WORK IS IT IS ON THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS A YOUTH IN THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE PROGRAM. AND SO IF IF THOSE CREDITS ARE BEING TAKEN OFF THE ORIGINAL SENTENCE NOT THE SENTENCE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY SERVING BECAUSE OF THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE SYSTEM. THOSE INCENTIVES GO AWAY. WE KNOW THAT THE FOLKS WHO DO THESE KINDS OF POGRAMS. ARE SET MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY GET OUT OF THE PUT INTO THE PUBLIC THAT THEY DON'T RE OFFEND AND IN FACT WITH RECIDIVISM RATES RUNNING. INTO THE 5060% IN CALIFORNIA. THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE WITH THOSE WHO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND ARE PAROLED. THE THE RECIDIVISM RATES ARE ONE POINT SEVENTY TWO POINT 5% DEPENDING ON THE YEAR THEY'RE VERY SMALL SO IT'S A PROGRAM-THAT WORKS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GIVEN UNDER THIS STRUCTURE WITH PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND YOU FEDERAL. THAT WE'RE ALIGNING THE CREDIT SYSTEM TO MAKE SOME SENSE MAKE SURE THAT WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PRESERVING THOSE EFFICIENCIES AND THOSE INCENTIVES FOR THOSE WHO ARE ON THE INSIDE. THAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL NO THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS TYAN OF ARGUS ADMIN I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INITIATE JUSTICE AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ACTIVATE THE POLITICAL POWER OF THOSE IMPACTED BY MASS INCARCERATION. WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB NINE SIXTY FIVE FOR THREE KEY REASONS WHY IN CALIFORNIA SENTENCING LAWS ARE EXTREMELY HARSH AND REMOVE HOPE FROM PEOPLE'S LIVES. EVEN WITH RELIEF UNDER USE OFFENDER PAROLE TWENTY FIVE YEARSIS A LONG TIME. THIS SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS MAKES PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO MAKE THE HARMFUL CHOICES THAT THREATEN THE SAFETY OF THE INSTITUTION AND PERPETUATES CYCLES OF VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA. TWO THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT RELEASE IT'S ONLY ABOUT ICENTIVIZING TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE ALL CREDIT MUST BE EARNED THROUGH THE COMPLETION EDUCATIONAL REHABILITATIVE AND SELF HELP PROGRAMS. MOST PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY NOT BE RELEASED AT CDC ARE ONLY FINDS AN AVERAGE OF 18% OF PEOPLE SUITABLE FOR PAROLE EVERY YEAR. AND ONLY 2% OF PEOPLE ARE FOUND ELIGIBLE DURING THE FIRST PAROLE HEARING WHICH THIS THESE WOULD BE. THREE PEOPLE RELEASE UNDER USE OFFENDER PAROLE HAVE THE LOWEST RECIDIVISM RATE OF ANY GROUP. ACCORDING TO CDC ARE FOR FOLKS REALLY CENTER YOU THE FENDER PRO IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN THEY HAD A RECIDIVISM RATE OF 0% AFTER ONE YEAR 0% AFTER TWO YEARS AND TWO POINT 2% AFTER THREE YEARS. THE OVERALL RECIDIVISM RATE FOR THAT SAME YEAR WAS FORTY SIX POINT 1%. SENATORS AB NINE SIXTY FIVE WILL PRESENT HOPE AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO INVEST THE TIME AND WORK NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. IT WILL HELP REDUCE OUR PRISON POPULATION AND REUNITE FAMILIES WHILE IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF THE INSTITUTION AND THE COMMUNITY OVERALL. THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN REGULATION SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE. THIS BILL WOULD CORRECT THAT AND PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BEGIN TO END OUR ADDICTION TO PUNISHMENT AND FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT WITNESS. THE MORNING CHAIR AND SENATORS. MY NAME IS RICHARD MORALIS AND I'M A MEMBER OF INITIATE JUSTICE THIS IS NOW MY SECOND OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON GATES. SINCE BEING RELEASED JUST NINETY FIVE DAYS AGO. I WAS SENTENCED TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY I WAS IN PRISON FOR TWENTY YEARS SEVEN MONTHS AND TWENTY ONE DAYS. WHEN I FIRST WENT IN I COULDN'T FATHOM THE OPPORTUNITY? OF BEING FREE ONE DAY BUT HERE I AM AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. AFTER NEARLY A YEAR IN I KNEW THAT I NEEDED TO CHANGE. I DON'T WANT TO DIS A DRUG ADDICT IMPRISONED. AT THE END OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE WITH THE HELP OF GOD AND FAMILY -- BARKED A NEW PATH. I STARTED CARRYING A STARTED TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT I DID AND FOR WHAT I COST AND FOR MY LIFE IN THE FUTURE. I HEAVILY PARTICIPATED IN SELF HELP REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND EARNED A BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE DEGREE. IN HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATION BECAME ONE OF SEVEN TO RECEIVE SENATORIAL RECOGNITION -- FOR BECOMING A STATE CERTIFIED ALCOHOL AND DRUG COUNSELOR FROM THE SENATOR THEN DARRELL STEINBERG. NOW THE MAYOR -- THAT PROGRAM IS SPONSORED BY THE CROP ORGANIZATION WHO NOW EMPLOYS ME TODAY PROP FIFTY SEVEN ALLOW FOR ME TO GET TO MY PAROLE BOARD HEARING. NINE MONTHS EARLY BUT I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO EARN ANY TIME OFF OF MY YOU DEFENDER DAY. SENATE BILLS TWO SIXTY TWO SIXTY ONE A. B. THIRTEEN AWAIT AND PROFIT D. SEVEN CREATED HOPE FOR MANY OF MINE CAR SERRATED FRIENDS WHO COULD NOT SEE. A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE STILL INSIDE WHO ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO BETTER THEMSELVES WITH NO INCENTIVE OR NO HOPE OF EVER COMING HOME IN THE FUTURE. MY BEST FRIEND TED GRAY WHO CO FOUNDED THE ORGANIZATION THE CROP ORGANIZATION THAT I WORK FOR TODAY. HAS BEEN INCARCERATED FOR OVER NINETEEN YEARS AND IS THE HARDEST WORKING MAN I KNOW. HE JUST COMPLETED HIS MASTER'S DEGREE IN ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP. AND LEADS AND PARTICIPATES IN MANY. SELF HELP REHABILITATE OF GROUPS I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT HIM AND OTHERS LIKE HIM WHO HAVE WORKED HARD TO TRANSFORM THE CULTURE PRISON. THROUGH THOUGHT PRO SOCIAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR AND ACTIONS. WELL BECAUSE OF EXISTING LAW ALL OF THE CREDITS THAT HE EARNS AND OTHERS LIKE HIM -- WILL ONLY COME OFF OF THEIR MAXIMUM OF ENTER DATE INSTEAD OF THE YOUTH OFFENDER DATE. OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS IF AB NINE SIXTY FIVE PASSES TED AND OTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED VERY HARD COULD GET TO THEIR PAROLE BOARD HEARING A FEW YEARS SOONER. AND HAVE A CHANCE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR HARD WORK. WHEN TESTIFYING BEFORE THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY AFTER MY TWELVE DAY OUT? I REMEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER SAYING WE NEED TO TRUST THAT OUR PAROLE BOARD COMMISSIONERS. ARE LAST BACKSTOP MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ALREADY ARE BEING PAROLED. AB NINE SIXTY FIVE WOULD NOT BE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD FOR ANYONE. IT IS SIMPLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD SOONER. AND I CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT THE PAROLE BOARD IS A VERY STRINGENT PROCESS I WAS IN THERE FOR OVER SEVEN HOURS. AND BELIEVE ME THEY LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED. HAD I BEEN DENIED THE MINIMUM DENIAL I WOULD RECEIVE JUST THREE YEARS. I'M GRAY FORM FORTUNATE TO HAVE EARNED TIME OFF MY SENTENCE BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT AN ANOMALY. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST WORK JUST AS HARD OR HARDER THAN I HAVE. BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LWS ARE WRITTEN THEY HAVE TO REMAIN IN PRISON WITH NO OPPORTUNITY GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD. YOU DEFENDER IS LIKE TEN WILL EVENTUALLY GET OUT OF PRISON. BUT I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC WOULD PREFER IF THEY'RE RELEASED A FEW YEARS EARLIER. BECAUSE THEY WORK EXTRA HARD TO EARN THEIR FREEDOM THROUGH THEIR OWN REHABILITATION I RESPECTFULLY URGE RIVAL FOR A. B.

I WANT TO MAKE SOME ROOM AT THE TABLE AND THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. pTHE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WERE IN OPPOSITION. TO EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE THE CURRENT CREDIT ADOPTED BY CDC ARE PURSUANT TO PROP FIFTY SEVEN ALREADY APPLIED TO YOUTH OFFENDERS. ADDING CONDUCT CREDITS TO PC THIRTY FIFTY ONE NOT ONLY GETS VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND SEX OFFENDERS RELEASED EVEN EARLIER. IT EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF TREATING MULTIPLE CRIME VICTIMS THE SAME AS ONE CRIME. SITE OFFENDERS WE SUPPORT REHABILITATION BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN THE GRAVITY AND THE NUMBER OF CRIMES. AN INMATE MAKES AN ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE AND FOR THESE REASONS WHERE PROPOSED. SHE TURNED MEMBERS CORSO'S ALONG BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION -- JUST POINT OUT THE EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE DATE FOR OFFENDERS WHETHER YOUTH YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS WHETHERTHEY'RE DETERMINEDLY SENDS. IN A TERMINALLY SENSE OR SENSE TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE LOG GUARANTEES THAT THOSE PEOPLE. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD EVEN IN THE CASE OF A DETERMINATE SENTENCE. THIS BILL -- FOR THOSE WHO ARE INDETERMINATE LEE SENTENCED -- PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE THE BOARD SOONER UNDERSTANDING IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE OF RELEASE -- BUT WE FEEL THAT AGAIN AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S POINT OUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN THE OFFENSE COMMITTED -- AND THE AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT AND SO BECAUSE EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BEFORE THE BOARD -- PRIOR TO WIN YOUR SENSE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN SURPLUS FOR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SAUCIER Là ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. SENATOR JEFF THANK YOU MY UNDERSTANDING IS -- THE REASON FOR THIS BILL CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS THAT. UNDER THE CURRENT REGULATIONS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS BEEN APPLYING. OF THE CREDITS THE GOOD TIME ANOTHER CREDITS NOT TOWARD THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PAROLE DATE WHICH IS THE EARLIER DATE. BUT THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS INITIAL PREPROGRAMMED DATE WHICH MEANS THEY HAVEN'T ADJUSTED FOR THE CHANGES. IN THE LAW IN THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER. PAROLE PROGRAMS SAID HE SAID BASICALLY IT YES THAT'S THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND SO. YES UNDER THE YOUTHFUL OFFENDER PROGRAM. WHICH YOU COULD AGREE WITH OR DISAGREE WITH THAT'S EXISTING LAW THEY DO HAVE AN EARLIER DATE FOR PAROLE. BUT IF THEY'RE WORKING IN AND WORKING ON CREDITS. TO IN THE COURSE WORK DOING THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED. THOSE CREDITS APPLY TO THEIR ORIGINAL SENTENCE NOT THE YOUTH OFFENDER SENS SO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ABILITY TO GET TO A PAROLE DATE EARLIER THAN THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE. INITIALLY WOULD HAVE ALLOWED BASED ON THE WORK THAT THEY DO WHICH IS WHY. THE INCENTIVES IN THIS CASE ARE WORKING. JACKSON I WAS SO EXCITED TO HEAR YOUR QUESTION THAT I FAILED TO ASK IF THERE WERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YOU DID AND I THOUGHT THAT -- SO WHEN I HAVE MEANT THERE WEREN'T BUT APPARENTLY THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT SIR CHAIR NUMBERS DON KEPT HIM BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. ANY ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ME FOR THE INTERRUPTION I APOLOGIZE SO JUST A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE IS. TO WE'RE TRYING TO REHABILITATE THESE YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS THAT'S WHY WERE TRYING TO ADVANCE CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND ARE SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT. WITH OUT THIS LEGISLATION. AND THE FACT THAT THESE YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS DON'T BENEFIT AT ALL -- OR BENEFIT VERY LITTLE WITH THE WITH THESE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT THIS CREATES AN INCENTIVE THAT DOESN'T OTHERWISE EXISTENCE THAT WRECKED. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CLOSING COMMENTS I JUST ASK FOR YOUR OF A THANK YOU -- GOOD MADAM. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MUCH AS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORLOCK [inaudible] BRADFORD. JACKSON FIVE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE MORALE. WIENER ALL RIGHT WIENER AYE.

WELL NOW DO AB ONE SIXTY FIVE YOU HAVE THE FLOOR [inaudible] WHAT? THANK YOU SIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% AB ONE SIXTY FIVE A BILL THAT WHEN SURE THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE PROPERLY TRAINED ON THE USE OF GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE EIJI VERO IS A JUDICIAL ORDER THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TEMPORARILY REMOVE FIREARMS FROM AN INDIVIDUAL WHO POSES AN IMMINENT RISK OF HARM. TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS WHEN USED TO THEIR FULL POTENTIAL G. V. R. OWES ARE POWERFUL TOOL THAT CAN PREVENT MASS SHOOTINGS AND SUICIDES AND SAVE LIVES. AND FORCING G. HEROES HAVE BEEN UNDER UTILIZED SINCE THEY WERE FIRST INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN UNLESS THAN TWO HUNDRED ORDERS WERE ISSUED DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS THEY WERE AVAILABLE. THOSE NUMBERS INCREASE SOMEONE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THANKS LARGELY TO INNOVATIVE TRAINING PIONEERED BY DISTRICT AND CITY ATTORNEYS IN SEVERAL COUNTIES. WHICH OF HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS BETTER UNDERSTAND WHEN AND HOW TO SEEK THESE ORDERS. FOR EXAMPLE A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE G. VARIOS WERE ISSUED IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY LAST YEAR 43% OF THE STATEWIDE TOTAL THANKS TO THE GOOD WORK OF SAN DIEGO CITY ATTORNEY MARI ELLIOT. WHO HAS BEEN A KEY ADVOCATE AND LEADER FOR INCREASED TWO G. B. R. O. TRAINING? THE STATISTIC SHOWS THE TRAINING WORKS AND THAT WE NEED STATEWIDE TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THIS POWERFUL TOOL IS BEING USED TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL SO THAT OUR OFFICERS CAN KEEP THEMSELVES IN THE PUBLIC SAFE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND GUN VIOLENCE ORGANIZATIONS HAS NO OPPOSITION AND RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE TWO LEADING ADVOCATES STEVE LINLEY FROM THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND JULIA WEBER FROM THE DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. ONE SIXTY FIVE THANK YOU. MISTER LILLY OF THE FLOOR. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SIR. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PRETTY CALIFORNIA WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE PASSAGE OF AB -- TEN FOURTEEN WHICH ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT FAMILIES AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS TO PETITION THE COURT TO OBTAIN A GONNA BUY FOR IN ORDER WHEN A PERSON IS AT RISK OF INJURY. TO SELF OR OTHERS. HAVING A FINAL SUCH ORDERS TO PRETTY PROHIBIT THE PURCHASE A POSITION OF FIREARMS OR THE ORDER IS IN EFFECT AND ALLOW WARRANT TO BE ISSUED TO SEIZE THESE FIREARMS AMMUNITION MAGAZINES. ALTHOUGH THE GT R. O. LAW. HAS NOT BEEN AFFECT OVER THREE YEARS IS EVIDENT THAT MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES EITHER DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE LAW. DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN FILL GAPS IN EXISTING LAW OR DO NOT HAVE A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LAW. IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. WE SUPPORT ANY TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT I CAN FURTHER THE G. V. R. O. PROGRAM WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES THAT IT IS EFFECTIVE HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE WE MISSED THE MARK INITIALLY. BY NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH TRAINING TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WITH THIS BILL WE'RE HOPING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. IN INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF G. ROSE TO MAKE IN OUR COMMUNITIES A SAFER PLACE. THANK YOU THIS WEBER. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JULIA WEBER I'M APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT OF AND AS A SPONSOR OF AB. ONE SIXTY FIVE I'VE WORKED IN THE FIELD OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESPONSE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS INCLUDING DEVELOPING A RESTRAINING ORDER POLICY WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. TRAINING JUDICIAL OFFICERS AND STAFF TEACHING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LOG GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW. AND I'M CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IMPLEMENTATION FELLOW WITH THE DIFFERENCE LAWCENTER. ALL WHICH MEANS I'M DOING STATEWIDE OUTREACH ON THE G. V. R. O. AND TRAINING AND HAS ALL ON THE HAS ALREADY BEEN POINTED OUT -- WE KNOW THE G. V. R. O. HAS BEEN UNDER UTILIZED AND I'M SEEING THAT AS I GROW ACROSS THE STATE AND TALK WITH COURTS. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- WE BELIEVE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL ARE I WANT TO NOTE THAT THE G. V. R. O. IS A CIVIL NOT A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PLAYS A HOWEVER A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN G. B. R. OWES. AND IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER RESTRAINING ORDER PROCESS SEES. THERE ARE PARTIES IN THESE MATTERS THEIR PARTICIPATION LEGAL PROCESS WITH THEIR DECLARATIONS FILING THE CORRECT FORMS APPEARING FOR TESTIMONY. THAT'S ALL CRITICAL. AND NONE OF THAT CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING -- IN ADDITION TO FILING THE FORMS TESTIFYING APPEARING AT THE HEARINGS THEY'RE ALSO EXPECTED TO SERVE AND ENFORCE THESE ORDERS. WHICH INCLUDES REQUESTING THAT THE RESTRAINT PARTY TURN OVER THEIR FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION WHEN THEY BECOME PROHIBITED. AND OF COURSE THIS CAN BE A VERY DANGEROUS TIME FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FOR OTHERS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT TRAINING TO SUPPORT SAVE IN A AFFECTED PROCEDURES IN THIS AREA IS CRITICAL -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRAINING CAN LEAD TO LOCAL PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE COURTS. AND MORE ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IMPORTANT LAW WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY SAVE MORE LIVES. AB ONE SIXTY FIVE WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL IN GETTING THE WORD OUT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INCREASING THEIR ACCESS TO THIS CRITICAL TOOL.

UNDER EXISTING LAW CERTAIN FARM TRANSACTIONS MUST BE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE EITHER THROUGH MAILING OR ONLINE FORMS. THIS INCLUDES SELF REPORTED FARM OWNERSHIP REPORTS NEW RESIDENT REPORTS INTERFERE MILLIA TRANSFER REPORTS INTERIOR OR RELIC FIREARM REPORTS. THE GOP THE DOJ HAS FOUND IN IT OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FIREARM REGISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED VIA MAIL. MAIL IN FORMS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO READ ARE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO TAKE LONGER FOR THE DOJ TO PROCESS. IN RESPONSE THIS BILL ADJUST THE FARM REGISTRATION PROCESS TO ENCOURAGE ONLINE REGISTRATION AND TO ALLOW THE DOJ TO PLACE A REASONABLE SURCHARGE NOT TO EXCEED TWENTY DOLLARS ON MAIL IN REGISTRATION FORMS.

I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT -- ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN SEVENTEEN WHICH WILL CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TRAINED PEER SUPPORT TEAM MEMBERSAND THEIR FELLOW PEACE OFFICERS. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ENCOURAGE PEACE OFFICERS TO SEEK TREATMENT AND SUPPORT FOR DRAMATIC STRESS BEFORE IT MANIFESTS INTO MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. IN A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STUDY ROUGHLY REPORTED EXPERIENCING A TRAUMATIC EVENT. BUT LESS THAN HALF OF THEM TOLD THEIR AGENCY ABOUT IT. EVEN MORE TROUBLING ABOUT HALF OF THE OFFICERS REPORTED PERSONALLY KNOWING ANOTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO CHANGED AFTER EXPERIENCING A TRAUMATIC EVENT. BUT ONLY ABOUT HALF REPORTED KNOWING AN OFFICER THE END IN ADDITION THAT HALF REPORTED KNOWING AN OFFICER WHO HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE. PEACE OFFICERS ARE OFTEN RELUCTANT TO UTILIZE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF ADVERSE JOB IMPACTS THE STIGMA SURROUNDING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND THE PERCEPTION AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY MUST SHOW NO SIGNS OF WEAKNESS. THE ABILITY TO SPEAK WITH A PEER SUPPORT OR WITH HERE. WHO HAS SHARED EXPERIENCE AND SHARED UNDERSTANDING IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE TYPICALLY RELUCTANT TO SPEAK WITHOUT SIDERS? IN OTHER SETTINGS YOUR SUPPORT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HELPING PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE WITH ADDICTION AND ALSO IT'S BEEN USED TO HELP FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS WITH THEIR RE ENTRY INTO SOCIETY. THIS BILL IS FIRST AND FOREMOST ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN UNIFORM TO SUFFER IN SILENCE. BY PROVIDING FOR CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION WITH TRAINED PEER SUPPORT PERSONNEL AB ELEVEN SEVENTEEN WILL ENCOURAGE PEACE OFFICERS TO SEEK THE SUPPORT AND TREATMENT THEY NEED IN TIME TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

MY NAME IS SEVEN WALKER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENTAL GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR CCPOA I AM ALSO A YOUTH CORRECTIONAL OFFICER -- OUR MODEL IS OUTDATED IT'S THAT SIMPLE -- YOU WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SYSTEM THAT WAS. BUILT IN THE FORTIES -- AND THE INSTITUTIONS ARE PRE DATE THAT -- THE THING WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT WE CAN NOT CONTINUE TO DENY THE OBVIOUS. WE HAVE A PROBLEM OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN. AND IT'S IN CAPABLE OR AN INTERESTED IN RESOLVING THE PROBLEM. WE'RE ASKING MOSTLY YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. TO SEE AN ENGAGE WITH HUMANITY IN EVERY CONCEIVABLE MANIFESTATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT SOLD IN MIND ALL THE WHILE WE ARE DEMANDING THEY SWIPE THEIR HUMANITY OFTEN ON THE SCREEN AS IF IT WERE A NAP. THE PUBLIC DEMAND IS FOR OFFICERS TO HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER AND TO BE HELPFUL IN THEIR TIME OF NEED. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN HOURS ARE SPENT. ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT A BULLET OR A CELL DOES TO HUMANITY. BUT THE COST IS TOO HIGH TO INVEST IN THE MAINTENANCE OF THE SOUL OF AN OFFICER. SILENCE IS BROKEN BY SILENCE OUR OUR BY SUICIDE. WE CANNOT RESORT TO SPIN OUR AGENCIES ARE CONTINUING. TO TO LIE TO THE PUBLIC AND SAY THAT THE ACTIONS OF ONE BAD OFFICER DOESN'T TAINT THE WORK OF ALL THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN ON THE LINE. YES IT DOES. TRAINING TECHNOLOGY IN TERMINATION OF THE SOLUTION TO EVERY TO EVERYPROBLEMS FOR THE AGENCY. IT IT ISN'T. WE GIVE OUR OFFICES THE TOOLS DATE THEY CONTEND THAT WE GIVE OUR OFFICES DIDN'T. THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO DO THE JOB. AND IT'S THEIR JOB TO DEAL WITH THE NEEDS STATE OF THE DEVELOP AS A RESULT OF THE TO OF THE JOB. BOTTOM LINE IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THIS SYSTEM. IF WE IF WE WANT THIS SYSTEM TO CHANGE WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF IT -- WE CAN EITHER INVEST. IN DISCIPLINE. ARE WE CAN INVEST IN HELPING PEOPLE. IS THAT SIMPLE A WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A SYSTEM OF HELP. OF REHABILITATION OF RESTORATION. BUT NOT FOR THE PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN IT. THAT'S NOT FAIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THESE WITH.

GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY. TO ASSEMBLY BILL. EIGHT SEVENTY NINE THIS IS A CONCEPT THAT'S COME UP BEFORE AND AND CALIFORNIA'S HUNDRED HOME TO HUNDREDS OF GUN LAWS. INCLUDING RECENTLY ENACTED GOES GUN LAWS A REQUIRES A PEOPLE TO CONTACT THE OJ FOR SERIAL NUMBER WHEN THEY'RE BUILDING A HOME BILL FARM -- WE'VE HEARD THAT THIS IS A LOOPHOLE AND OBVIOUSLY CRIMINALS WHO ARE NOT OBEYING THE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED GUN LAWS ARE. NOT A ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS ONE EITHER. HOWEVER THIS BILLS GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH IT AND HOW THE PUBLIC'S GOING TO COMPLY WITH IT AS WELL AS HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING. TO GOING TO AFFECT ITS RELYING ON THE AMMO BACKGROUND CHECK TO RUN THE BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE YOU CAN UTILIZE THE NEXT SYSTEM FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT FIREARMS. GROUND CHECK FOR AMMUNITION SET TO GO INTO EFFECT JULY FIRST IT'S AN UNPROVEN SYSTEM -- WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK AT THIS POINT -- THURS SO A LOT OF SPECULATION ON HOW. WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS WE MIGHT BE FORCING WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT THIS IS PREMATURE TO RELY ON N THAT SYSTEM TO NOW? INCLUDE. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS MORE CHECKS AS WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE REQUIRING BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ON PIECES OF METAL ON PARTS -- AS YOU AS YOU HEARD FROM -- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE GONNA BE TASKED WITH CREATING A BOOKLET THAT'S GOING TO HAVE PICTORIALS AND INFORMATION ON HOW TO IDENTIFY THESE PARTS -- I'M VERY CURIOUS TO SEE THAT WEEDS -- WERE STILL LOOKING FOR A LOT OF GUIDANCE ON EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAWS INCLUDING -- CERTAIN THINGS WITH -- ASSAULT WEAPONS AND SO NOW TO PUT THIS GIANT TASK OF IDENTIFYING EVERY HUNK OF METAL WHICH QUALIFIES AS A PRECURSOR PART. IS THAT IS GOING TO BE A MONUMENTAL TASK AND I'D BE VERY CURIOUS -- TO DISCUSS THE FISCAL WHEN THAT BECOMES APPROPRIATE -- FURTHERS THERE'S OTHER ISSUES LIKE ANTIQUE PARTS WHAT'S EXCLUSIVELY FOR ANTIQUE FIREARM AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DISTINGUISH THAT. AS WELL AS THE YOU KNOW THE THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM IS PRECURSOR PARTS DO NOT HAVE ANY IDENTIFYING MARKS ON ON THAT LIKE A FARM WHERE IS A FIREARM FRAME HAS A SERIAL NUMBER. WHICH MAKES IT IDENTIFIABLE YOU CAN SEE IF THE CHECKS RUN WERE AS A PIECE OF METAL THAT. THAT IS AN UNFINISHED FRAME RECEIVERS NOT GONNA HAVE A PART NUMBER ON IT OR MIGHT HAVE A PART NUMBER BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAVE A SERIAL NUMBER YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW THE DATA MANUFACTURING. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW ANY OF THAT SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KNOW IF SOMEONE BOUGHT IT BEFORE THIS LAW INTO EFFECT WHETHER IT'S BEEN SOMETHING. THAT WAS PURCHASED AFTERWARDS WHETHER THEY CAME IN FROM OUT OF STATE HOUSES ACTUALLY TRULY GOING TO BE ENFORCED -- I THINK THAT THIS IS -- THIS IS STILL PREMATURE I I THINK THAT CRIMINALS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO IGNORE THIS ALL LIKE THEY DO THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER GUN LAWS ON THE BOOKS. WITH THAT WE STAND IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MYSTERIES. MORE OF A GERMAN ROY GRIFFIS SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION. OUR MAIN CONCERNS AMERICAN OF ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID HE COVERED IT WELL BUT OUR MAIN CONCERNS ARE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BEING ALREADY EXTREMELY OVER TAX BY THEIR OWN TESTIMONY. UNFUNDED WE HAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND OUR PREDICT FELONS ON OUR STREETS ALREADY THAT THEY ARE OVER TASK AND DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO ADDRESS THAT SITUATION. I THINK IT'S A LITTLE INAPPROPRIATE USING THE SITUATION HAPPENED HERE AND STOCK AMOUNT LAST WEEK I'M ALSO A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THIRTY TWO YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE STATE. KIND OF OFFENDED BY THROWING OFF THROUGHOUT THEIR NAME TO BE USED IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT -- THIS LOBBYING AFFECT WOULD CHANGE THAT SITUATION AS WE CAN POSSIBLY THIS INDIVIDUALS ON THE ON IT WOULD FELONS LIST. AND HAD OR DOJ ASIANS HAVE THE TIME TO DEAL WITH THAT. MAYBE HE WOULDN'T HAVE FARMS AS WELL SO WE COULD THROW ALL KINDS OF SPECIALIZATION OUT THERE BUT OUR MAIN CONCERN IS AGAIN TASK IN THESE FOLKS IN THE OJ WITH YET ANOTHER MANDATE. THAT'S GOING TO TAKE THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION AWAY FROM WHERE IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE. AND HAVING THESE PARTS OUT THERE HAVING SOMETHING STERILIZED WITH THIS NUMBER IN A FARM WITH ANOTHER NUMBER. REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE JUST GOING TO CREATE A NEW ENFORCEMENT NICE NIGHTMARE FOR THOSE REASONS ON THE REASON MY COLLEAGUE OUTLINED WEREN'T STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS REPRESENTING OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAPULETS REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTS SINCE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA SPORTSMAN'S. INSPIRED CLUB INTERNATIONAL. ALL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA ALSO IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WITH THE CHAMBER -- TEMPLES ALL OF THE HAVE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE APOLOGIZE I WAS DOWN IN ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY. LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE ANY COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. I I JUST HAVE ONE AND AND THIS YEAR I'VE BEEN ON SEPT FIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME GETTING. TO ENJOYED BUDGET FISCAL REVIEW FROM THE PUBLIC SAFETY. PERSPECTIVE AND I'VE BEEN SORT OF A MAYES SAID SOME OF THE BILLS WE APPROVED IN HOW HOW MUCH IT DOES COST -- TO IMPLEMENT THEM SO I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS -- WITH WITH THIS BILL. I MISTER GRAHAM DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE ON IS IT WOULD REQUIRE IT HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF -- IS THE CURRENT STAFF. IT WOULD JUST FIT WITHIN THEIR REGULAR WORK ASSIGNMENTS SO WOULDN'T BE. A BURDEN AT ALL TO TAXPAYERS. IF I MAY ANSWER -- THE BILL IS SOMEWHAT FORWARD LOOKING IN THE ENSE THAT MOST OF MOST OF THE ACTIVITY STARTS IN. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THERE ARE VARIOUS BILLS AS YOU SAID AT THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED OVER THE YEARS THAT. THE I. T. SIDE OF DOJ -- ARE ATTEMPTING TO CATCH UP WITH -- DEALING WITH AGE CHANGES IN AGE REQUIREMENTS ETCETERA -- THIS BILL IS -- NOT ONE THAT WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. AND THE AMMO CHECK SYSTEM AS I SAID EARLIER WILL BE STANDING UP IN A FEW DAYS -- THERE'S ABOUT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THIS ONE THE SYSTEM WOULD STAND UP. SO -- I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE ANY. CONCERNS THAT OUR OUR IT SIDE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET IT GOING IT'S GONNA BE VERY CLOSELY MODELED AFTER THE AMMO SYSTEM. WHICH HAS TESTED WELL -- YOU KNOW BEHIND THE SCENES AND INTERNALLY -- I'VE SEEN THOSE TESTS -- SO I'M NOT AGAIN I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE IF WE CAN MAKE A A SYSTEM IS PROBABLY GONNA BE 85% THE SAME -- WORK JUST LIKE THE EMR SYSTEMS GOING TO WORK. SEC DO I HAVE A MOTION. YOU HAVE A QUESTION [inaudible] WELL. THAT -- MITCHELL WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU ACCESS THE QUESTION AND YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I YOU REMINDED ME JUST NOW THE TRUMPS OF FIVE AND ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION STATED OUT OF CONCERN FOR A LACK OF FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO DO THIS. KIND OF WORK I RECALL WE AUGMENTED ON THE DEPARTMENT SALARY OF A SALARY WHO THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET -- DO YOU HAPPEN TO RECALL THE AMOUNT OF MINUTES FOR THE BASIS PROGRAM AS A CERTIFIED MEMBER OKAY ALL RIGHT. I DON'T REMEMBER EITHER BUT I KNOW IT WAS NOT [inaudible] I VOTED FOR BILL -- ON THE SEX OFFENDER LIST AND I WAS AMAZED AT AS THE TTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE SHOWED US HOW. MUCH IT'S COSTING ALL THE WORK CAN I GET UP NOW MULTIPLE TIERS. AND AND SO I WAS LIKE OH MY GOODNESS I'M. SORRY TO APPRECIATE. WHAT WHAT A VOTE REALLY MEANS AND SO THAT'S WHAT PROMPTED? APPROPRIATELY SO BUT I I WASN'T SO MUCH RESPONDING TO YOUR COMMENT BUT TO TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION WHO WHO CLAIM THAT. THEY WERE YOU KNOW UNDER BUDGET AND WOULDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEMSELVES THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERED MY MEMORY ABOUT ACTIONS WE DID TAKE IN THIS BUDGET NOT WAS HOPING YOU COULD REMEMBER THE DETAILS AS A SUB FIVE MEMBER I DON'T RECALL. UNFORTUNATELY I CHAIR IS IN HERE -- BUT THE THE POINT I'M ATTEMPTING TO MAKE IT MAY NOT BE TO YOUR BIGGER PIC BIGGER STATEMENT ABOUT. FUNDING EVERY BILL BUT SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO THE COLLECTION OF FIRE ARMS FROM FROM INAPPROPRIATE PEOPLE WE DID AUGMENT THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AS WE HAVE IN PAST YEARS. AS SENATOR NIELSEN REMINDS US EVERY BUDGET HEARING WHEN WE HEAR IT. THAT WE'VE DONE THAT SO I JUST WANTED TO FOR THE RECORD MAKE THAT DECLARATIVE STATEMENT AND SEEN NO OTHER MEMBERS. WHO MAY BE INCLINED TO MAKE A MOTION I'M OF THE BILL? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE AP PS. YEAH. GREAT WE HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE -- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AND MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU COULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. QUESTION IS DO YOU PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORLOCK. BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL HI MITCHELL AYE MORALE. WE WERE ALL NOW. WIENER. WE WILL KEEP THAT ON CALL IT HAS A ONE VOTE AND WE WILL -- THANK ROLE LATER THANK YOU. THE SOONER WE GET THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THE GLAD YOU HAD. ARMED SECURITY THIS TIME. I WILL TAKE A SECOND TO ALLOW MR GRAMM. TO PACK UP. AND THEN. WE HAVE A ASSEMBLYMEMBER. GREY YES -- CUNNINGHAM HOW HE CAME BACK. RACES BEEN WAITING ALL THIS TIME CAN TAKE CUNNINGHAM. THERE'S GOT TO BE A A RULE MODIFICATION OR SOMETHING. WELCOME THE SOME RETURNING HAVE YOU HAVE -- TWO BILLS ONE WAS ON CONSENT IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED THANK YOU THE OTHERS AB SIX SIX THREE ITEM. ELEVEN WELCOME THANK YOU SENATORS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SIX SIX THREE AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WE ARE FIGHTING A WORLDWIDE FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS THE FASTEST GROWING. CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IN THE WORLD. I THINK ONE IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THAT FIGHT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE PROVIDE. REHABILITATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I CAN TELL YOU AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS IT IS A CRIME. THAT IT IS SERIOUS AND IN SOME WAYS IT'S UNLIKE ANY OTHER -- THESE VICTIMS OFTEN NEED COUNSELING THEY NEED RELOCATION SERVICES THEY NEED A PLACE TO STAY THEY NEED A SAFE HOUSE THEY NEED. A PROTECTIVE ORDERS THEY NEED SUPPORT -- THAT'S THAT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE FRANKLY -- ONE ISSUE WE ARE SEEING IS THE WITH THE STATE WIDE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND WHICH FUNDS MOST VICTIMS SERVICES FOR GENERAL CRIMES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WE'RE SEEING AN ISSUE WHERE THE STATEWIDE VICTIMS COM FUND IS IS UNDER FUNDED AND POTENTIALLY IS GOING TO REACH A POINT OF INSOLVENCY AT SOME POINT THE NEAR FUTURE. WHICH WILL REQUIRE BACK FILL FROM THE GENERAL FUND OR SOME. REMEDIATION OF THAT -- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO WITH THIS BILL WHAT I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER APPROVING? IS SETTING UP A STANDALONE FUNDING SOURCE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE WOULD DO THAT BY TAKING 75% OF THE FINES PAID FOR SOLICITATION. HOW WHICH IS ALREADY CRIMES STATUTES NON NEW CRIME -- WE TAKE 75% OF FINES PAID BY THOSE CONVICTED OF SOLICITATION -- WE WOULD FINAL THAT MONEY INTO THE TO THE COUNTY LET THE COUNTY RETAIN THAT. EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE VICTIM. SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS. I JUST A FEW STATS TO CONSIDER. JUST ON THE ON THE ON THE ARGUMENT AND IN SUPPORT OF THE ARGUMENT THAT -- THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING -- FOR A CHILD VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IT'S ESTIMATED THE AVERAGE COST OF CARE. IS AROUND SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. THAT'S FOR A CHILD EVEN AN ADULT. VICTIM A TRAFFICKING THE AVERAGE COST OF CARE IS ESTIMATED TO BE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH -- THIS IS THIS IS. AND EXPENSIVE ENDEAVOR BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR BECAUSE THESE FOLKS REALLY NEED HELP -- TO BE ABLE TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES. OFTEN IN. IN A COUNTY THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT EVEN RESIDE IN. I MEAN THERE TRAFFIC ON A CIRCUIT IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- SO. I THINK IT'S WHERE THE CHANGE IN LINE I THINK GIVING THE COUNTY LEVEL OF FUNDING INDEPENDENT THAT IS RETAINED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WITH EASE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE STATE WIDE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND A AND B. GIVE OUR COUNTIES THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TRY TO HELP THESE VICTIMS. OUT OF THE OF THIS HORRIBLE CRIME AND WITH ADDED. RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY NO PROBLEM DON CAP KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED CALIFORNIA ALSO SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CHRISTINE WAR CRIME VICTIMS ACTION ALLIANCE AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DO I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. DO I HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION DO I HAVE A CLOSING STATEMENT. I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU THE SERVER CUNNINGHAM MADAM SECRETARY FOR TO TAKE THE ROLE. QUESTION IS THE FASTER APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORLOCK I MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE. ALL I WIENER. SO AS TO BOTH SETTLE BE ON CALL THANK YOU FOR COMING SERVER CUNNINGHAM THAT BRINGS US NOW. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS. ITEM THIRTEEN AB NINE ONE SEVEN WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBER SENATOR. TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU EIGHTY NINE SEVENTEEN A BILL WHICH UPDATES THE TIMELINE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND CERTIFICATION ENTITIES TO PROVIDE THE PROPER DOCUMENTATION TO THE VICTIM OF CRIME OR THEIR REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE PURPOSES OF OBTAINING YOU VISA AND TV'S THE CERTIFICATION. A U. VISAS GRANTED TO VICTIMS OF CRIME OR THEIR LOVED ONES WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND HAVE FULLY COOPERATED WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ASSIST IN THE PROSECUTION OF A CIMINAL CASE. SIMILARLY THE TV'S THE ALLOWS ELIGIBLE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. TO TEMPORARILY REMAIN AT WORK IN THE UNITED STATES. IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION TO ENSURE YOU VIS A AND T. VISA APPLICANTS HAVE RECEIVED CERTIFICATION FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND FOR THOSE IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS IN AN EXPEDITED MANNER. HOWEVER MANY IMMIGRATION PRACTITIONERS AND DEPORTATION DEFENSE HAVE EXPRESSED THE NEED TO CREATE A CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT IS PARALLEL TO THAT OF THE CURRENT IMMIGRATION COURT SYSTEMS. TO FURTHER PROTECT VICTIMS. AB NINE SEVENTEEN SIMPLY REQUIRES A CERTIFYING ENTITY TO PROCESS VICTIMS CERTIFICATION FOR EITHER OF THESE VISAS. ON ONE OF TWO TIME LINES THIRTY DAYS FOR MOST INDIVIDUALS AND SEVEN DAYS FOR THOSE IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS DUE TO THE IMMEDIATE SITUATION AT HAND. WE MUST ENSURE THAT DURING THESE TRYING TIMES CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S IMMIGRANTS ARE SUPPORTED. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORTOF THE BILL IS CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ POLICY ADVOCATE WITH SHEILA AND CENTER FLORIDA STAFF ATTORNEY WITH HITLER. GOOD MORNING MR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CYNTHIA FLORENCE AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS SHE LAUGHED. OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT PROVIDES REPRESENTS REPRESENTATION TO NON CITIZENS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND NATURALIZATION PROCESS FAMILY BASE ADJUSTMENTS. VICTIMS OF CRIME AND INDIVIDUALS FACING IMMINENT DEPORTATION. I'M HERE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF AB NINE SEVENTEEN FOR TWO REASONS. TO ENSURE THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANTS AND TO EMPOWER CAL TO PROVIDE THE BEST REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE AGAINST DEPORTATION. IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT POLITICS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAVE CHANGED THE CLIMATE UNDER WHICH IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS PRACTICE LAW. WE FELT THIS CHANGE MOST IN IMMIGRATION COURT. IMMIGRATION JUDGES ARE UNDER PRESSURE TO ADJUDICATE ADJUDICATE AS MANY CASES IN A SHORT OF A TIME WHEN IT'S POSSIBLE. NOW THAT IMMIGRATION JUDGES ARE UNABLE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY CLOSE CASES THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE LESS LIKELY TO CRACK CONTINUANCES TO PRESENT ANCILLARY FORMS OF RELIEF. INCLUDING YOU AND TV SAYS THIS IS AN THIS HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOU AND TV SO APPLICANTS. WHO ARE BENEFICIARIES OF COLLATERAL RELIEF IN IMMIGRATION COURT PRACTITIONERS MUST WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO SUBMIT RELIEF IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE IMMIGRATION JUDGE THAT THESE FORMS OF RELIEF ARE VIABLE? DEFENSES A DEPORTATION IN SHORT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE WE CAN NO LONGER DEPEND ON THE LUXURY OF TIME TO HELP ADVISE THE BEST STRATEGY TO DEFEND NON CITIZENS FROM DEPORTATION. THAT IS WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE VICTIMS OF CRIME IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHAT'S WITH AXES TO POLICE REPORTS OF CERTIFICATIONS. THAT THEY MAY PURSUE COLLATERAL RELIEF AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND DEFEAT THE THREAT OF DEPORTATION FOR ALL THESE REASONS DE LA IS A PROUD TO SPONSOR OF AB. NINE SEVENTEEN EVERY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU'RE ABLE. THANK YOU MISTER FLORES MISTER SANCHEZ CHRIS RESPONSE WHICH OF pIMMIGRANT RIGHTS CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST IMMIGRANT RIGHTS ORGANIZATION BUT TO BE A SPONSOR THIS MEASURE IN HERE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. CHRISTINE SMITH CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP DONE THE MYSTIC VIOLENCE AND SUPPORT. ANDREA RIVER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. PLEASE A CHAIR WITH ASIAN% AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. AMENDED WORK ON BEHALF SO YOU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WELCOME BACK MR CELL DILLON GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU KORI SAYS ELLO BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SURE SURE NOT OPPOSED TO THE UV SO OR TV SO OR THE PROCESS -- THAT THE TEMPS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF INVESTIGATIONS OR THE ABILITY. FOR VICTIMS AND WITNESSES TO BE PRESENT AND BE THANK YOU BE PART OF THE PROCESS. THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS IS LARGELY INTIMATELY MORE ABOUT EXISTING LAW WHICH PURPORTS TO GIVE THOSE WHO ARE ASKED TO SIGN THE CERTIFICATION THE DISCRETION TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE VICTIM WITNESS IS BEING COOPERATIVE. AND THEN STATE LAW THAT EFFECTIVELY. MANDATES THE SIGNATURE ON THAT CERTIFICATION FORM ALMOST IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON IS BEING COOPERATIVE SO THE STATE LAW SAYS THAT. A PERSON REQUESTED TO SIGN THE CERTIFICATION FOR A TV SIR UV SO -- THERE'S A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THE PERSON IS BEING COOPERATIVE UNLESS THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING COOPERATIVE AND SO IT'S A DEFAULT THAT. THIS FORM SHOULD BE SIGNED IN THIS IF IF THE NOTION IS GOING TO BE THAT THERE IS A PERSON. AN OFFICIAL WHO IS MAKING A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS VICTIM OR WITNESS IS BEING COOPERATIVE. THE NATIONAL BE THE SOLE PROVINCE OF THAT OFFICIAL IN THE INSTANT PROCEEDING THIS BILL SAYS THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WHO CAN REQUEST THE CERTIFICATION. AND THAT -- THE TIME FRAME IS SHORTER I UNDERSTAND THE PROPONENTS ARGUMENTS ON WHY THAT'S NECESSARY. WE JUST HAVE SORT OF A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN ABOUT THE PROCESS AGAIN NOT NOT WITH THE NOTION OF PROTECTING THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS OR WITNESSES CERTAINLY -- WE WANT TO PROTECT THEM WE WANT -- TO PROVIDE THEM WITH ANY -- ADMINISTRATIVE ABILITY THAT THEY NEED TO FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE JUDICIAL PROCESS OR ANY CRIMINAL OR LEGAL INVESTIGATIONS -- BUT MANDATING THAT -- HERE BE MORE PEOPLE WHO CAN ASK FOR THE CERTIFICATION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE EXISTING LAW THAT SAYS. YOU EFFECTIVELY SHARE OF FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR POLICE CHIEF YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS UNLESS YOU CAN SHOW ME THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY'RE NOT BEING COOPERATIVE AND SORT OF DISAGREE WITH THAT THAT BALLOTS AND THAT NOTION SO FOR THOSE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ALBUM. THANK YOU ARE THERE. GIVE ME ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES THE BILL I HAVE A MOTION -- NO DISCUSSION -- CLOSING STATEMENT MISS REYES.

BUT WE HAVE WORKING DILIGENTLY IN THAT REGARD SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES -- AB SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL QUESTION IS THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORE LACKEY. BRADFORD JACKSON FIVE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MORALE. WIENER. WE WILL HOLD OPEN THE ROLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEVEN A REYES. I YES. THIS CALL WATER. THE OTHER ASSEMBLY WOMAN. A. B. TWO FOUR THREE ITEM NUMBER THREE WELCOME [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING SENATORS. APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY. I AM HERE PRESENTING AB TWO FOUR THREE WHICH WILL REQUIRE PEACE OFFICERS STANDARDS TRAINING OF ALSO KNOWN AS POSED TO TRAIN PEACE OFFICERS ON IMPLICIT BIAS. EVERY TWO YEARS RATHER THAN THE CURRENT. FIVE WE COME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN UNCONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIAS EVERYONE IS BY. I AM. TO I'M CONSCIOUS AN IMPLICIT BIASES CAN AND DO AFFECT THE DAY TO DAY DECISION MAKING PROCESS SEES. OF EVEN THE MOST FAIR MINDED PEACE OFFICERS YET MORE AWARENESS CAN COME THROUGH EDUCATION INTERACTION AND CONVERSATION. DESPITE PEOPLE'S BEST INTENTIONS RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT SUBJECTS CAN CONSCIOUSLY EMBRACE IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY AND YT. ON TESTS THAT MEASURE SUB CONSCIOUS TENDENCIES STILL SHOW A STRONG PROPENSITY TO LEAN ON STEREO TYPES TO FILL IN THE BLANKS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT THEY DON'T KNOW. IT IS CRITICAL THAT PEACE OFFICERS RECEIVE MORE TRAINING ON A ROUTINE BASIS TO RECOGNIZE THEIR IMPLICIT BIAS EASE AND TAKES STEPS TO COUNTERACT THEIR UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCES. IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN OF COURSE EVERY FIVE YEARS TO REYES UNCONSCIOUS BIAS BUILT ON HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF PERSONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM THAT HAS CREATED DEEP DIVISIONS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY. RESEARCHERS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY EXAMINED ALMOST ONE HUNDRED TRAFFIC STOPS FROM STATE PATROL AGENCIES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. AND MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING BAKERSFIELD SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO. AND FOUND THAT BLACK AND LATINO DRIVERS WERE STOP MORE OFTEN THAN WHITE DRIVERS BASED ON LESS EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING. LOFT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WIELD IMMENSE AUTHORITY IN I BELIEVE THIS OBLIGATES THEM TO BETTER COMBAT THEIR BIAS. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ALSO RECOGNIZES AND TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO DEAL WITH IMPLICIT BIAS THAT AFFECTS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD A CULTURE THAT CONSTANTLY AND RESPECTFULLY ADDRESSES BIAS TO STRENGTHEN THE TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AB TWO FOUR THREE SIX TO AMPLIFY THE DOJ'S WORK ON IMPLICIT BIAS IN MANDATE THAT PEACE OFFICERS MUST BE TRAINED EVER TWO YEARS. TODAY WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS KIMBERLY PAPPY ON JUDICIAL PROFESSOR AND LISA HOLDER EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY LEGAL DIRECTOR WELCOME [inaudible] MORNING SENATORS. PLEASE HOLD A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY AND UCLA LAW LECTURE ON CONSTITUTIONAL POLICING. AND I AM DRESSING ADDRESSING YOU TODAY IN MY CAPACITY AS INTERIM LEGAL DIRECTOR FOR THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY. AND OAKLAND BASS RACIAL JUSTICE ADVOCACY GROUP. FOR TWENTY YEARS THE EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY HAS BEEN STUDYING IMPLICIT BIAS. AND ITS IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL DECISION MAKING. AND INSTITUTIONS. AND HERE'S WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID ALL PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS WHICH IS ALSO NOWN AS UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. AND THOSE BIASES DEVELOP OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME. TO EXPOSURE TO STEREO TYPES OFTEN RACIAL STEREOTYPES AND GENDER STEREOTYPES. INPUT THE BIASES INFLUENCE OUR BELIEFS OUR ATTITUDES OUR CONDUCT OUR DECISION MAKING. IN A WAY THAT OFTEN RUNS COUNTER TO OUR CONSCIOUS BELIEFS. AND OUR CONSCIOUS VALUES WHICH IS WHY THEY CAN BE SO FRUSTRATING AND INSIDIOUS. POLICE OFFICERS WITH WE TALKED ABOUT THE HUMANITY OF POLICE OFFICERS WELL POLICE OFFICERS YES THEY ARE HUMAN. TOO AND SO THEY TO HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS. STUDIES SHOW THAT WHEN PRIME TO WITH BLACK FACES IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHITE FACES JUST LIKE CIVILIANS POLICE OFFICERS ARE CONSISTENTLY MORE LIKELY TO ASSOCIATE BLACK FACES WITH CRIMINALITY. TO MISS IDENTIFY COMMON OBJECTS AS WEAPONS AFTER BEING SHOWN PHOTOS OF BLACK FACES. AND TO LABEL PHOTOS OF BLACK PEOPLE AS THREATENING. WHEN LEFT UNADDRESSED THE IMPLICIT BIASES OF OFFICES CONTRIBUTE TO STAGGERING RACIAL DISPARITIES IN POLICING? AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN WHITES TO BE STOPPED BY POLICE TICKETED. AND SEARCH DURING A STOP. AND UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE ARE ALMOST THREE AND A HALF TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SHOT BY POLICE OFFICERS THAN ON ARMED WHITE PEOPLE. SINCE BIAS IS LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF A LIFETIME IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNLEARN IT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WITH TRAINING. SYSTEM SYSTEMIC TRAINING. CHANGE IS POSSIBLE. COUNTER BY IS TREATING PROVIDES PRACTICAL TOOLS TO HELP PARTICIPANTS UNLEARNED STEREOTYPES. TO RETRAIN THE BRAIN TO DISRUPT STEREO TYPE. BASED IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIONS AND TO MANAGE THEIR BIAS. COUNTER BY ITS TRAINING IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE MUST BE ONGOING AND REOCCURRING. ONE CRITICAL COMPONENT OF AB TWO FORTY THREE IS THAT IT REQUIRES INTENSIVE REOCCURRING TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS. ONE OTHER THING STRESSFUL WORK ENVIRONMENTS STIMULATE BIAS. THERE'S NO MORE STRESSFUL WORK ENVIRONMENTS THAN BEING A POLICE OFFICER. INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO DO THE HARD WORK OF DISRUPTING THEIR OWN BIAS IN DECISION MAKING BUT INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO WORK AT IT. TO POLICE AGENCIES A TO CREATE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT STRUCTURES THAT DE STRESS THE WORK FORCE AND ALLOW THEIR OFFICERS TIME TO MAKE CAREFUL AND DILUTES THE DELIBERATE DECISIONS. THE KEY TO DISRUPTING. BIAS IN POLICING AND THESE TRAININGS WILL HELP INSTITUTIONS START TO CREATE THESE STRUCTURES TO SUPPORT THEIR OFFICERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR HOLDER GOOD MORNING. CHAIR AND A STING TO MEMBERS MY NAME IS KIMBERLY POPPY ON MY OF FORMAL TITLE IS JUDICIAL PROFESSOR -- I TEACH UNDER OF SCIENCE IN THE LAW. AFFECT OF TRAINING DOES NOT JUST OPEN MINDED ACTUALLY ALTERS BEHAVIOR AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT ACTUALLY CAN ALTER NARAL PHYSIOLOGIC REACTIONS. OF CRITICALLY FOR PICK FOR PEACE OFFICERS -- IF IMPLICIT BIASES HIGHER IN A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THERE'S ACTUALLY A BRAIN REACTION THAT LINKS TO THAT -- IF ONE HAS A PARTICULARLY HIGH LEVEL OF IMPLICIT BIAS LET'S SAY FRANCES TOWARDS AFRICAN AMERICANS. OR LET NEXT INDIVIDUALS WE FIND THAT A PART OF THEIR BRAIN CALLED THE AMYGDALA. ACTIVATES WHEN THEY SEE FACES THAT FIT THOSE PARTICULAR IDENTITIES. THE IMAGE WAS ACTUALLY THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT ALSO TURNS ON WHEN YOU SEE A SPIDER OR SNAKE. CONSIDER THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF A JUDGE. WHO IS MAKING A SENTENCING DECISION OR PROSECUTOR WHO IS MAKING A CHARGING DECISION IN FACT REASONABLY ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THROUGHOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM? SEEN AN INDIVIDUAL AND HAVE ANY REACTION IN YOUR BRAIN IS IF YOU'VE SEEN A SPIDER OR SNAKE WHICH WILL INCREASE YOUR BEGINS OF FEAR THREAD EXCITING AND DISTRUST TOWARDS AN INDIVIDUAL. COULD REASONABLY AND CONCEIVABLY. ALTER YOUR DECISION MAKING WITH REGARD TO THAT PERSON. PERHAPS THAT IS IN MOST A STARK RELIEF AND AND AND MOST CLEARLY SEEN THOUGH WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS. IF INDEED WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS NOTION OF SOMEONE HAVING OF YOUR THREAD EXILED YOUR DISTRUST REACTION TO ONE GROUP VERSUS ANOTHER IN. NUMEROUS ADDITIONAL STUDY SHOWING THAT WE CN EVEN. TRACK THAT BASED ON FACIAL FEATURES. SO THAT A PERSON WHO HAS A BIAS AGAINST LET'S SEE AFRICAN AMERICANS WILL BE MORE LIKELY -- IMPLICIT BIAS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE THESE SPIDER SNAKE LIKE BRAIN REACTIONS TO SOMEONE WHO LOOKS FAR MORE LIKE SHAQUILLE O'NEAL THAN MATT DAMON. OTHER THAT NOT WITHSTANDING THOUGH THIS NOTION IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE SPECIFIC NOR REACTIONS LINK DIRECTLY TO OUR STUDIES ON BEHAVIOR THAT IS THE LIFE AND DEATH DECISION MAKING CONTEXT FOR PEACE OFFICERS. FOR INSTANCE OF WHEN WE DO COMPUTER AYE SIMULATION SIMULATIONS AND THEY SHOW PEOPLE POPPING UP ON THE SCREEN. INDIVIDUALS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND ANGLO AMERICAN DESCENT WHO ARE EITHER HOLDING A WALLET A CELLPHONE OR GUN. WITH INSTANTANEOUS REACTION TIME WE FIND THAT THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES. WHO CHAU IMPLICIT BIAS AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO SELECT THE OPTION SHOOT? FOR AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN HOLDING A WALLET OR CELL PHONE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THEY ARE FOR A CAUCASIAN MAN HOLDING A GUN. WE CAN ACTUALLY ON DO THIS. THE THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE NEUROSCIENCE PROVIDES US WITH MUCH MORE THAN A HOLD HANDS SING C° Y OUR OPEN MINDS AND HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP TYPE COURSE WE CAN GO FURTHER THAN THAT AND ALTER THOSE VERY BRING REACTIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PROBLEMATIC AND THAT'S WHAT THE NEUROSCIENCE SHOWS US WE CAN LOWER THE LEVEL OF A MID DELIVERY ACTION. WE CAN ACTUALLY TURN ON THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WE SEE THAT PEOPLE WILL GET MORE ACCURATE IN SAYING SHOOT VERSUS NO SHOOT WHEN FACED WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S HOLDING AN OBJECT WE CAN LITERALLY INCREASE THEIR LEVEL OF ACCURACY. THAT'S WHAT TRAINING CAN DO. OF COURSE THEM. IN CALIFORNIA THE JUDGES RECEIVE -- TRAINING IN ETHICS ON A REGULAR BASIS A KEY WE I DON'T KNOW WHAT NUMBER WERE ON AT THIS POINT WE TEND TO CALL IT -- AND AT THE NATIONAL JUDICIAL COLLEGE A TRAINING IS UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS EVERY SINGLE TIME A CLASS IS TAUGHT THERE IS AN UPDATE. TO THAT PARTICULAR TRAINING SO WHAT DAY DOES NOT SO MUCH A CONCERN. IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE -- PERHAPS THE MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN WANTING FUSES SCIENCE. IN INFORMATION AROUND DECISION MAKING. IT IS NOT IS IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSTANTLY UPDATE. ANYONE WHO WAS DOING THEIR JOB WELL WE'LL KEEP UP WITH THE DAY TO DAY INFORMATION THAT IS BEING PUT OUT BY THESE NARAL SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THE GIVES US BETTER AND BETTER SOLUTIONS. EACH AND EVERY TIME. IT TAKES A WHILE TO RIDE A CLASS. IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG TO UPDATE IT IF PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SCIENCE. ANY CLASS THAT YOU TAKE SHOULD BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLASSICAL ENGLISH LITERATURE. I UNDERSTAND THAT -- ONE BUT INDEED IF WE USE THE SCIENCE IF WE USE THE TOOLS IF WE TRY TO CREATE AN EFFECTIVE TRAINING THAT WILL ALTER DECISION MAKING ALTER BEHAVIOR. AND ALTER NORMAL REACTIONS WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE JUSTICE OUTCOMES THROUGHOUT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND PARTICULARLY FOR PEACE OFFICERS THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. JUST COME UP TO THAT MAIN MIKE. CHRIS FOR SIGNS OF A TRUE OTHER CALLERS REMAIN IMMIGRANT RIGHTS INSTRUCTS SUPPORT.

PRETTY PROGRESSIVE WHO ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF POST. AND SO I ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT INSTEAD OF EVERY FIVE YEARS EVERY TWO YEARS. IN OUR FIRST RESPONSE WAS MIKE. YOU KNOW SHE SHOULD WE DO UPDATE THIS EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THIS WOULD MAKE IT SO WERE IN CONSTANT UPDATE MODE AND I HEARD YOU SAYING YOU KNOW SCIENCE KEEPS CHANGING. WE LEARN MORE. ON A REGULAR BASIS SHE SAYS SO. IT IS THE FIRST FALL -- THE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS ALREADY OFFERED IN THE ACADEMY SO AT LEAST WE GET STARTED PEOPLE THINKING YOU KNOW THEY MAY HAVE I MEAN EVERYBODY IS A LITTLE BIAS. IS A GREAT THE BROADWAY SHOW CALLED -- AVENUE Q. AND A FAVOR SO THERE'S A WONDERFUL SONG IN THERE IT'S IS EVERYBODY'S A LITTLE BIT RACIST AND THEY TALK ABOUT HOW. YEAH EVERYBODY DOES HAVE CERTAIN PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE BUT BASED UPON LIFE EXPERIENCE OR WHATEVER SO. I START WITH THAT ASSUMPTION -- SHE SAYS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE TRAINING IS ONLINE OR AGENCIES PUT TOGETHER OF COURSE. ON THEIR OWN. OFFICERS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO TAKE BY ANDATE FIRST AID AND CPR EVERY TWO YEARS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE EVERY TWO YEARS BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS EVERY TWO YEARS. AND PURSUE DRIVING EVERY YEAR -- SHE SAYS THAT THE SHE BELIEVES THAT THE TRAINING DEMANDS WERE NOW PUTTING ON FOLKS -- MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DO AND SHE RECOMMENDED THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU. THAT SHE SUGGESTED THAT WOULD CONTINUE DOING THAT EVERY FIVE YEARS AND FOCUSED INSTEAD ON DE ESCALATION. AND THE USE OF FORCE AT LEAST FOR NOW SHE SAYS CONSIDERING THE PROPOSAL OF THE PRESSURE. THAT IS PUT ON POST AND ON THE OFFICERS GIVEN ALL THESE THINGS THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO. SO WHAT MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS GIVEN THE GIVEN THE ISSUES IN THE PRIORITIES DO YOU THINK THAT THEY SHOULD. PREEMPT SOME THOSE ARE THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WERE ARTICULATED OR DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS IS TRAINING THAT WE ACTUALLY. EVEN THOUGH WE MUST DO IT THAT REALISTICALLY WE CAN ALSO REQUIRE EVERY TWO YEARS. THAT TO ME SENATOR WITH THAT -- YES. YOU YOU CAN RESERVE. THANK YOU -- I RESPECT TO THE NOTION THAT INDEED THERE ARE SEVERAL COURSES THAT ARE PEACE OFFICERS MUCH TAKE MUST TAKE. THAT ARE -- RE UP EVERY TWO YEARS SO TO SPEAK AND THE LIST THAT YOU A NUMERATOR -- WAS OF I THINK PARTICULARLY POIGNANT BECAUSE THOSE ARE ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IN A VERY REAL AND DIRECT WAY -- IMMEDIATE PUBLIC SAFETY IMMEDIATE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE AND STRESSFUL CONTEXT THAT -- AFFECT LIFE AND DEATH OF OUR CITIZENS RIANA ME ON A REGULAR BASIS. I WOULD PLACE DISCOURSE IN THAT SAME CATEGORY -- I WOULD SAY THAT YES EVERYONE IS A LITTLE BIT BIASED. MONDAY BIAS MANIFESTS ITSELF IN THE CLASSROOM WE HAVE GIVEN OUR TEACHERS OF THE TOOLS OF A PIECE OF CHALK. WHEN IT? WHEN IT? MANIFEST ON THE BENCH WE'VE GIVEN OUR JUDGES A GAVEL IN A ROW. BUT WHEN IT MANIFESTS IN THE ACTIONS OF OUR PEACE OFFICERS WE'VE GIVEN THEM A GUN. WE MUST THEREFORE HOLD THEM TO A HIGHER STANDARD. WE MUST HOLD THEM. TO THAT HIGHER STANDARD AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPPORT THEM. WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION. THE LUCKY THING IS THAT IN THE PAST WE'VE CREATED THESE COURSES BE AT THE KEY WE COURSES FOR THE JUDGES IN THE JUDICIAL CONTEXT. FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OR A POST WE'VE TYPICALLY CREATED THEM WITH COMMITTEES WORKING TOGETHER GATHERING INFORMATION AND AND DELIBEATING OVER THE PROCESS -- IF IF I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THESE OF COMMITTEES AND IT GOES BACK AND FORTH IN THEIR TO DRAFT AND THEN THERE'S REDRAFTED THEIR SUB COMMITTEES AND IS CANCELED MEETINGS AND IT DOESTAKE QUITE SOME TIME. THE NOTION IS THOUGH WITH ACADEMICIANS AND EXPERTS ARE INCLUDED IN THAT PROCESS. IF IF EXPERTISE IS BROUGHT TO BEAR AND THERE'S A REGULAR UPDATING JUST THE WAY IT'S DONE AT HE NATIONAL JUDICIAL COLLEGE JUSTIN WAITED STUNT ANOTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WILL GET HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT. AND THE LATEST INFORMATION RARELY WILL YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE NEW SCIENCE WILL COME UP YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE SOMETHING OUT THAT IS INCORRECT. RATHER WHAT YOU WILL FIND WITH GREATER FREQUENCY NINETY PLUS PERCENT USUAL FIND AN EVEN BETTER SOLUTION. EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE SCIENCE I THINK OUR OUR PUBLIC DESERVES THAT. I THINK OUR PEACE OFFICERS TO DESERVE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO ABOUT THEIR SAFETY THOSE SAME STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE PEACE OFFICERS ARE MORE LIKELY. AND MORE QUICK TO SAY SHOOT FOR AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN HOLDING A WALLET OR CELL PHONE. ALSO SAY THERE ARE PEACE OFFICERS DELAYED. WHEN THEY ARE DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO SHOOT AN ANGLO AMERICAN MAN WITH A GUN THAT PUTS OUR PEACE OFFICERS AT RISK AS WELL? SO FOR THEIR SAKE I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS INCREASE THE LEVEL OF QUALITY INCREASE THE UPDATE INCREASE THE COMMITMENT. I THINK WE'LL GET A BETTER OUTCOME IN THE END. MATT MAJORS FOLLOWERS THAT MAY. SO YOU THE EXAMPLES YOU CITE ARE EXAMPLES THAT COME UNDER THE HEADING OF DE ESCALATION IN THE USE OF FORCE. AND I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT IS A FOCAL POINT -- AND THE NECESSARY -- ONE AS WE ADDRESS POLICE OFFICER TRAINING IT'S FEDERAL CHARTER SO I AM. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. IS THIS AN EITHER OR SITUATION OR COULD WE INCORPORATE BIAS. FOCUSING ON THE DE ESCALATION AND USE OF FORCE ELEMENT RATHER THAN -- BE TRYING TO CHEST. CRANE ON THIS PARTICULAR GENERAL I SUBJECT MATTER EVERY TWO YEARS BECAUSE ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH -- RESOURCES OR WHATEVER YOU FOR THAT WOULD. THAT MIGHT END UP TEACHING THE SAME COURSE YOU MENTIONED IF WE CAN UPDATE THEM THAT'S GREAT BUT MIGHT END UP OFFERING THE SAME COURSE YOU'RE AFTER WHICH WE DON'T WANT. SO I'M NOT WORRIED BEFORE YOU RESPOND AS IF WE COULD -- BRIEFLY ON THAT WOULD BE GREAT. ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR -- IF THIS TRAINING WERE TO SIMPLY BECOME AN AD JUMPED ONTO THE ESCALATION IT WOULD LIKELY LOSE ITS EFFICACY. OF THE NOTION OF TEACHING. DE ESCALATION -- AND THEN ADDING ON THE NOTION OF IMPLICIT BIAS WOULD NOT COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE SCINCE WILL SHOW THAT WHILE YOU CAN TEACH PEOPLE TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR IN GENERAL AND THEN MENTION -- YES AND LET'S TRY TO BE FAIR THAT DOESN'T ALTER THE INEQUITY IN THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR SO THE PROBLEM IS NOT SIMPLY WE NEED OUR PEACE OFFICERS TO DE ESCALATE ACROSS THE BOARD. THE PROBLEM IN MANY WAYS AS WE NEED THEM TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE MORE TROUBLE DE ESCALATING IN THIS ARENA AND THEN GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED WHICH REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST. AND FUSE IT IN HERE WITH A FEW ADDITIONAL POWER POINTS. GIVEN THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY ALTER THEIR BEHAVIOR WITH REGARD TO THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF BIAS. THANK YOU FOR SHIP. pI APPRECIATE THE BILL I DO M.. I CAN'T IMAGINE AS WAS A REFERENCE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE EVERY TWO YEARS BECAUSE WHILE I THINK ALL OF US CAN -- UNDERSTAND THAT. THIS. THE VALUE OF THIS TRAINING WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- WHATEVER GOVERNMENT AGE EVERYTHING IS IT THAT THE THAT THAT FREQUENCY BUT pSOMETIMES BUT I THINK THAT AS YOUR WITNESS CHARACTERIZED. BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION AND A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION AS MUCH FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS BECAUSE AS I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE REFERENCES WHICH I THINK -- WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA KNOW TO BE TRUE. THAT THE THAT THESE BIASES WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR CULTURE WE ALL HAVE THEY'RE NOT UNIQUE AND THEY'RE NOT LIKE ONLY ONE RACE HAS THE HAS THE BIAS -- IT'S BASICALLY SO INGRAINED THAT WE THAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THEMSELVES PUT THEMSELVES AT RISK. WHEN THEY HESITATE? IF IT WERE IF THEY SEE A WEAPON IN ONE CIRCUMSTANCE BUT OVER COMPENSATE EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T SEE A WEAPON IN A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE SO I I THINK THAT THIS IS VERY COMPELLING -- AND I'M SURE AS YOU GO THROUGH THE PROCESS I KNOW THAT YO'RE YOU'RE REALLY ONLY OF PROBES AND THEN -- FLOOR BUT IF THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS AROUND THE TWO YEARS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED -- OTHERWISE I THINK THERE'S A VALUE TO THE FREQUENCY SO -- WITH THAT'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND WE HAVE A MOTION. WE'VE GOT A MOTION AND WILL DO A ROLL CALL BUT OF COURSE WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN BECAUSE WE HAVE -- MEMBERS ARE ABSENT BUT CENTER MORE LIKE DID YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMONER. I I I HAVE LITTLE DIFFICULTY WITH THE EVERY TWO YEARS MAYBE EVERY THREE FOUR I'D BE A LITTLE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH AT OR ADRIN M.. WE'LL DO THE ROLL CALL. CLOSE -- I'M POLICIES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE BILL AUTHOR PLEASE MAKE YOUR LIFE THANK YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND THE CONVERSATION IN THE DIALOGUE -- THIS BILL REALLY JUST CREATES A STANDARD AND SO WHEN HEARING IN THE LANGUAGE THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY NOT AROUND THE TWO YEARS BUT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE CURRICULUM CAN BE REFRESHED AND ADAPTED. AND ALSO HOW THEIR SOME OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR MORE INTEGRATED -- KIND OF COURSE AT THE I AND I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BIAS WERE GENERALLY THINKING ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC. IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE BIAS THAT HAPPENS WHICH WITH IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE IS NO THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF EDUCATIONAL LEVELS -- THAT WE SEE IN OUR POLICE OFFICERS BEFORE THEY DECIDE TO GO TO THE ACADEMY TO GET TRAINING AND WHEN THEY'RE GOING INTO THE ACADEMY TO GET TRAINING MOST OF THAT IS PREPARING ON THEM TO ACTUALLY DO THAT JOB. NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT BIAS. AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE AND THE DIVERSITY OF THEMEMBERS THAT ARE ARE SERVING AND PROTECTING US. I THINK ALSO THAT DE ESCALATION IS ACTUALLY COUPLED WITH IMPLICIT BIAS I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND DE ESCALATION USE OF DEADLY FORCE WITHOUT REALLY HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TRIGGERS THAT MIGHT BE IMPACTING HOW LAW -- HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ACTUALLY YOU KNOW? REACTING IN INTERACTING WITH FOLKS IN THOSE MOMENTS AND SO MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE INTEGRATED. AND LESS BLAME ORIENTED CONVERSATIONS AS WE TRY TO TACKLE THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT WE'RE SEEING -- ON THE STREETS AS IT RELATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY I THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION AND THE CONTINUE DIALOGUE I DO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. RIGHT WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL. MOTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MORLOCK. BRADFORD. JACKSON LIKE JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MORALE [inaudible] NO WIENER. WILK M. KEEP THE ROLE OPEN AND ARE ABSENT MEMBERS WILL RETURN. AND NOW I SEE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA I BELIEVE THIS NEXT AND THAT IS FOR AB [inaudible] TWELVE EIGHTY TWO WELCOME. THE CASHIER SENATORS OF THE OPTIONS ON THIS BILL FOR YOU TODAY. AB TWENTY TWO PROHIBITS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION FROM ASSISTING OR ALLOWING PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS TO ARREST. DETAIN OR OTHERWISE TAKE INTO CUSTODY INDIVIDUALS IN STATE CUSTODY FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES. IT WOULD ALSO CUT BY REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE CDC ARE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH PROHIBIT THE DETENTION OF INDIVIDUALS BEYOND THEIR PRISON TRYING TO ALLOW FEDERAL IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS TO TAKE INDIVIDUALS INTO CUSTODY. ADDITIONALLY WOULD ALSO CUT BY THESE -- THESE REGULATIONS BY BENDING CITIES ARE FROM TRANSFER AND IMAGE OTHER STATE PRISON WITHIN NINETY DAYS. OF THE PERSON'S RELEASED A THIS BILL IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE THE PEDAL MINISTRATIONS MASS ATTENTION AND DEPORTATION STRATEGY WHICH INCLUDES THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AGENCY CALPERS TO UNLOCK THE CONSCRIPT. PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS INTO IT'S A FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY. THESE EFFORTS ARE IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION OF ESTABLISH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AS WELL AS WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL PRECEDENT. FEDERAL LAW IS CLEAR UNDER THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION NATIONALITY ACT UNLICENSED LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT AUTHORIZED TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAW. THIS INCLUDES PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES. THIS MEASURE TAKES IMPORTANT STEP OF MEASURING THE CDC ARE COMPRISED OF FEDERAL LAW BY PROHIBITING PRIVATE SECURITY CONTRACTORS ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA PRISONS.

A REAL ESTATE PROPERTY RIGHT A LITTLE BUSINESS SMALL SMALL SHOPPING CENTER SET UP A BUNCH OF LAPTOPS THAT A PRIVILEGE COMPUTERS RONALD ILLEGAL GAMING AND THEN IF SOMEBODY ACTUALLY ONE THEY WOULD JUST. DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND THEN MOVE ON RIGHTS NOBODY EVER GOT PAID OUT AND WE ACTUALLY FOUND UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT A LOT OF THESE PLACES WERE ACTUALLY FRONTS FOR THINGS LIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- THEY WERE FRIENDS FOR DRUGS. THE GAMING WAS OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL WE PASSED LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT -- TO ACTUALLY GO AFTER THESE FACILITIES TO SHUT THEM DOWN LOCAL CITIES AND MUNICIPALITIES.

A CHANGEOVER SERRA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWELVE NINETY FOUR A BILL THAT STRENGTHENS THE DOJ'S IN OTHER LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY AGENCIES ABILITY TO BRING STRONGER ENFORCEMENT. ACTIONS AGAINST ILLEGAL GAMBLING OPERATORS THE AMERICAN GAMING ASSOCIATION ESTIMATES THAT THE SEGMENT OF THE LEGAL GAMBLING INDUSTRY KNOWN AS THE SWEEPSTAKES CAFE INDUSTRY. WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS BILL COLLECTS MORE THAN TEN BILLION A YEAR IN ILLEGAL PROCEEDS. THESE UNLAWFUL GAMBLING OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN STORE FRONTS AND STRIP MALLS AND COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS OF CITIES AND TOWNS ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATS INCLUDING. MANY HERE IN CALIFORNIA ADDITIONALLY THESE OPERATE OPERATIONS ACT AS MAGNETS IN INCUBATORS FOR OTHER CRIMES INCLUDING DRUG SALES AND VIOLENT FELONIES. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO WOULD ALLOW DOJ AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO SEE THE ILL GOTTEN GAINS FROM ILLEGAL GAMBLING OPERATIONS THAT ARE HELD IN BANK ACCOUNTS? THE BILL CHEESES BY EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF CRIMINAL PROFITEERING ACTIVITY TO INCLUDE THE OPERATION OF THE LEGAL SLOT MACHINES. AND GET AND GAMBLING DEVICES THIS ALLOWS FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS TO BE INITIATED AGAINST THESE ILLEGAL OPERATORS. AND ALLOWS YOU JAY AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO FREEZE THE BANK ACCOUNTS THAT CONTAIN THOSE ILL GOTTEN GAINS UNTIL A JUDGE MIGHT A FORFEITURE IS.

OKAY WILL WAIT FOR OUR MISSING AUTHORS. FINISHED WITH BREAKFAST X. WELCOME. WE WILL NOW HEAR ITEM TWENTY YOUR BILL AB -- SIXTEEN OH THREE CENTERS. THIS BILL BASICALLY TAKES CALVET -- ARE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND CREATES A STATUTE FORTIN PUTS IT IN THE STATUTE. YOU KNOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE EVIDENCE BASED WE KNOW THEY WORK THEY TARGET THE COMMUNITIES THAT -- ARE EXPERIENCING THE MOST VIOLENCE -- INVEST IN THIS COMMUNITIES WE'VE SEEN A GREAT SUCCESS I KNOW IN OUR SHARED DISTRICT -- IN TERMS OF THE REDUCTION OF GUN VIOLENCE IN OAKLAND -- DUE TO USE A LIFE AS WELL AS THE ORGANIZATION IN RICHMOND VANCE PEACE WHICH REALLY WORKS TO INVEST THE COMMITTEES AND REALLY TO STOP THE VIOLENCE FORT STARTS -- WE'VE WE'RE THRILLED THAT THE BUDGET -- CONTAIN MORE RESOURCES FOR THIS -- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT A SENATOR AND WE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE -- CAN WE KNOW THESE PROGRAMS WORK LET'S PUT IT SAID SHE LET'S STOP THE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY BUT MISTER TESTIFIED. FOR IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS MIKE THANK LIVELY. I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT GIFFORD LAWCENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE WHERE I DIRECT OUR COMMUNITY VIOLENCE INITIATIVE. AND I'M HERE TODAY NOT JUST ON BEHALF OF GIFFORD'S BUT ALSO A MUCH BROADER COALITION OF VIOLENCE PREVENTION ORGANIZATIONS COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS CITY LEADERS AND RESEARCHERS. THAT ARE ALL COMMITTED TO REDUCING VIOLENCE BY IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE BASED AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN STRATEGIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA. IN RECENT YEARS CITIES LIKE OAKLAND RICHMAN AND LOS ANGELES HAVE SEEN ENORMOUS REDUCTIONS IN SERIOUS VIOLENCE AND WE'RE LOOKING TO SCALE THAT SUCCESS TO MORE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THIS YEAR WE'VE PUSHED HARD FOR FUNDING INCREASES THE CALVET UP WHICH IS THE STATE'S ONLY DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THIS TYPE OF ON THE GROUNDWORK. AND WE THANK YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR HEARING OUR CLL AND FOR CHOOSING TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM. NOW THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE HAVING THE MAXIMUM IMPACT POSSIBLE AND THIS BILL AB SIX IN A THREE AT CHIEF THREE IMPORTANT GOALS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT PLACES THE CALVET PROGRAM IT TO STATUTE MAKING THIS A MORE PERMANENT FIXTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S VIOLENCE PREVENTION INFRASTRUCTURE. SEC YET THE BILL WOULD REMOVE OUTDATED AWARD CAPS THAT ARE HOLD OVER FROM PRIOR YEARS WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS MUCH SMALLER. I PRESIDENT AWARD CABS ARE AT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER GRAND T. OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD WHICH WOULD FOR FIRST BSE SEE WHICH IS THE AGENCY THAT ADMINISTERS CALVET -- TO DILUTE THIS PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY BY DISTRIBUTING A LARGE NUMBER OF SMALLER GRANTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE COUNTY I. P. EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE TO SET A MORE REASONABLE CAP SO THAT APPLICANTS IF THEY CHOOSE CAN APPLY FOR MORE FUNDING DEPENDING ON LOCAL NEED AND CONDITIONS. THIRD THIS BILL FOCUSES ON CALVET THIS BILL FOCUSES CALVET TO RESOURCES I'M COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK OF EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE. WE KNOW BASED ON DATA AND STUDIES THAT VIOLENCE IS EXTREMELY CLUSTERED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF PLACES AND IMPORTANTLY IN ANY GIVEN CITY THE VAST MAJORITY OF SERIOUS VIOLENCE IS CARRIED OUT BY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO PROPOSE PLANS AND STRATEGIES TO WORK WITH THOSE ROUTE HIGHEST RISK OF ENGAGING IN VIOLENCE. THEY'RE JUST TWENTY FOUR CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT COMBINED CONSTITUTE MORE THAN HALF OF THE HOMICIDES THAT ARE EXPERIENCED IN THE STATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND IT IS IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING THE BULK OF OUR RESOURCES. OTHER STATES THAT HAVE SUCCESSFUL STATE WIDE VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS SUCH AS CONNECTICUT NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS ARE FOLLOWING THIS EXACT SAME STRUCTURE. THIS BILL WOULD BRING OUR CAL B. I. P. PROGRAM IN LINE WITH BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER STATES. WHICH HAVE RATES OF GUN HOMICIDES MUCH MUCH LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA. SO VIOLENCE IS IMPOSING AN INCREDIBLE COST IN TERMS OF HUMAN LIVES BUT ALSO AN ECONOMIC COST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HEALTH CARE COST IT CETERA. AND INVESTING IN SCALING UP PROVEN SOLUTIONS IN OUR MOST IMPACTED CITIES IS A VERY SMART DECISION. THIS BILL WOULD HELP INSURE THAT THESE RESOURCES HAVE THE LARGEST POSSIBLE IMPACT AND SAVE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF LIVES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ON BEHALF OF GIFFORD'S IN OUR COUNTY IP COALITION WE URGE YOU TO PASS THIS BILL THROUGH THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YOU CAN JUST COME UP TO THE MIKE. HELLO KATHY BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. EMILY ALL VOLUNTEER WITH MOMS DEMAND ACTION I SUPPORT THIS BILL.

ADAM KEVIN ON BEHALF OF EVERY TIME FOR GUN SAFETY IN SUPPORT. FEELING FOR THE BRADY CAMPAIGN IN TRUMP SUPPORT. RIGHT ANY OTHERS. OKAY LET'S SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HELLO GOT A LOVELY STREET CURA BILLS WITHOUT OPPOSITION GOOD TO KNOW -- LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY -- COMMONSENSE SENATOR MORE LIKE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ARM. YES IT ON GOVERNMENT COVER. SO ON THE BUDGET DISTRIBUTED MEDIA. THE BUDGET CONFERENCE I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'VE ALREADY SET ASIDE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP ME OUT YOU'RE SAYING YOU AYE CODIFIED BUT? YOU READY GOT THE FUNDING AND THERE'S ALREADY A PROCESS SO WHAT ARE MY BUT I JUST MISSION I THINK ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL THINGS THIS WOULD LIFT THE CAPS WHICH IS IMPORTANT. IN TERMS OF HOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- IN IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND THERE DOING THE WORK -- THE CAP WHICH IS AS MENTIONED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS IS ABOUT TWO FIFTY YEAR -- WE WANT MORE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT IF WE INVEST MORE RESOURCES -- WE CAN DO THAT SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS AND JUST TO PUT THIS IN STATUTE SO THAT WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM YEAR AFTER YEAR. AND I'M SURE IT WILL INCLUDE ADDITIONAL BUDGET ASKS -- AS IT ALWAYS IS -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE REALLY INVESTING IN THIS PROGRAM. SO A TRIP TO THE CAP IS THE IS THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES. TO OVER MY WORDS VERY ARE YOU WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE THEY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- WERE WORKING WITH THEM THE THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THERE THE ONE ADMINISTRATION -- ON THE CAP QUESTION TALKING TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE SENATE ASSEMBLY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO TO RECTIFY THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND SIR MORE LIKE BY MY DAD ON THE AUTHOR REFERENCED ORGANIZATIONS BUT IN FACT CITIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THIS FUNDING AND GIVEN THE OBVIOUS -- LARGE DIFFERENCES IN POPULATION OF OUR VERY CITIES. A ARM IF THE CITY OF LA WERE TWO ONE ENGAGE IN THEY ARE ENGAGING IN A VERY ROBUST. OF GUN VIOLENCE REDUCTION PROGRAM. THAT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE -- FOR SAID TO GRANT. THEY WOULD HAVE THE SAME CAP AS OF FOR EXAMPLE AND MY CITY OF BERKELEY WHICH IS A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE VERSUS A TEN MOUNT MILLION POPULATION CITY SO I THINK THAT. IT. THE CHANGE TO LIFT THE CAP IS -- AT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF WHO WHO IS ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FUNDING -- THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD NOTICE THAT THE FUNDING THAT IS SECURED. FOR CALVET BEEN THIS BUDGET WHICH IS THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET IS A ONE YEAR ONLY. SO -- I THINK BY. PUTTING I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BY PUTTING. THIS IN THE STATUTE WELL IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THERE'S NOT AN APPROPRIATION ASSOCIATED. IT POTENTIALLY RAISES THE PROFILE OF THE PROGRAM AND POTENTIALLY GIVES IT A BETTER SHOT AT ON GOING SUPPORT IN BUDGETARY ACTIONS NOT A GUARANTEE. BUT POTENTIALLY. ALRIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION. OKAY WE'VE GOT A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE -- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. MOORLACH AYE BRADFORD JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE. MORRELL AYE WIENER. I WITH THE BILL I AM WILL BE ON CALL WHEN OUR ABSENT MEMBERS WILL COME BACK THEIR OWN DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND NOW I THINK IT'S OUR FINAL AUTHOR. HEY FINALLY WE ALWAYS WE ALWAYS SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST I KNOW DON'T YOU LOVE THIS. GOD DOES SAVE ONE LOOK BACK AT IT DOES SAVE ONE'S BACK -- I DON'T HAVE A A STICK ANYWAY WE ARE NOW GOING TO HEAR ITEM TWENTY ONE AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- SIX YEARS AGO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS GAINED THE RIGHT TO A DRIVER'S LICENSE SO THAT THEY COULD BE LAW ABIDING DRIVERS AN EFFORT AIMED AT PROVIDING US ALL PEACE OF MIND ON THE ROAD. NOW FEAR IS UNDERMINING THE AB SIXTY LICENSE PROGRAM RECENT NEWS REPORTS HAVE UNCOVERED THAT AYE ACE HAS BEEN ACCESSING STATE RUN DATABASES CONTAINING INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WITH LICENSES THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER AB. SIXTY THESE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY TACTICS ARE CONCERNING WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN PROHIBITS CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM MAKING THEIR DATABASES AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ONE FORSMAN AGENCIES WITH ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA LAW. ENFORCEMENT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM CLASS ARE ALLOWED TO ACCESS INFORMATION FROM DRIVERS LICENSES OR IDENTIFICATION CARD RECORDS INCLUDING NAME DATE OF BIRTH RESIDENTS AND OR MAILING ADDRESS AND PHOTOS. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN UP HOLDEN PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S CORE VALUES AND THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE TODAY. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. CHRIS RESPONSES WITH CHAIR OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS HI HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SEVEN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT HAS EVOLVED FROM HUMANE ENFORCEMENT TO AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT. WE SAW PEAK -- NGUYEN SECURE COMMUNITIES WAS CREATED DURING THE BUSH ERA TO RUN FOR YOUR PRINTS TO ANYONE WHO CAME IN CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT IMMIGRATION. ALL THIS AUTOMATED SYSTEM ARE RESULTING IN -- THEIR RELIGION OF TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM INCLUDED THIRD PARTY ENTITIES IN WHICH THERE IS NO NEED. FOR ICE TO PRODUCE A WARRANT TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB SIXTY CHIRLA HAS. HER CASES AND BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION THE DMV DMV STAFF OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD NO CRIMINAL OFFENSE JUST AN IMMIGRATION. DEPORTATION ORDER ARE AN INTERACTION WITH C. P. ICE WHO ARE OFTEN OBTAINED A DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND ICE HAS SHOWN UP TO THEIR HOUSE FOR EXAMPLE. GIVE ROLE WAS IN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS -- WAS A FORMER RESIDENT OR WEST COVINA APPLY FOR ANY BE SIXTY DRIVER'S LICENSE USING HIS REAL NAME IN ISRAEL INFORMATION WEEKS LATER. HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATION -- ISIS SHOWED UP TO HIS HOUSE THIS BILL BUILDS UPON THE PROTECTIONS OF AB SIXTY WITHOUT INTERFERING THE CURRENT DATABASE THAT ICE. AGE ASIDE AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL FOR THE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OUR LET'S SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MANAGER MEMBER DAN FILLS OUT ON BEHALF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DA'S OFFICE THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE. THAT THE TRUST THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH THEM -- COMMITTEES REMAINS. IN THIS FIRST REPORT THANK YOU OTHERS. ANDREA RIVER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER IN SUPPORT. LESLIE CALDWELL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. RIGHT ANY OTHERS. SEE IF THERE'S WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I THINK YOU ALL CAN STAND THE DIVORCE I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE IN THE CONCERT RIGHT THERE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- LET ME JUST START BY SAYING SURE OF DO NOT ENGAGING IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT NOR DO THEY WISH -- TO OUR OBJECTION TO THIS BILL IS IS MERELY ONE I THINK OF SCOPE BAD THE BILL. EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDES -- ACCESS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT DATABASES WE UNDERSTAND FROM MATERIALS FROM THE PROPONENTS AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR STATEMENT THAT THIS LARGELY REVOLVES AROUND. ACCESS TO DMV RECORDS AND BY A SUSPECT THERE MIGHT BE A WAY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WITHOUT. TOTALLY CLOSING THE DOOR FOR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION. FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INFORMATION SO AGAIN WHO IS NOT A DESIRE ON THE PART OF SHERIFF'S TO SHARE -- INFORMATION FOR IMMIGRATION PURPOSES -- BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE. NEEDS AND REASONS WHY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD NEED TO ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT DANGEROUS PEOPLE IRRESPECTIVE OF IMMIGRATION STATUS -- AND SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVA THANK YOU. OKAY. HEART ANY OTHER. OPPOSITION EARN ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. ALL RIGHT AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO A CLOSER AND I HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE DON'T SHARE SATIN BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM THIS IS BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR US I THINK TRYING TO COME UP WITH THE BILL -- TO TO REALLY NARROWLY FOCUS IT ON WHAT WE KNOW HAS HAPPENED WITHOUT EXPLANATION FROM ICE WE KNOW -- THAT ICE HAS SHOWN UP ON THE DOORSTEP OF OF INDIVIDUALS WHO OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING INDIVIDUALS WHO -- ARE HERE WITH THEIR AB SIXTY LICENSE INFORMATION AND PICTURE. THAT WE KNOW -- WHEN WE PASS THIS BILL WE TOLD PEOPLE IF YOU HAVEN'T COMMITTED A CRIME YOU'RE NOT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE USED AGAINST YOU? SO THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION IN THE COMMUNITY WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE DRIVING AWFULLY IT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US RIGHT. ARE ONLY IN AND WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS WE COULD GO OUT AND TELL OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T GO GET THIS LICENSE I MEAN THAT'S NOT WE WILL BE GOING BACKWARDS IN SAFETY I THINK -- AND I THINK ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS WILL BE GOING BACKWARDS ON THE SAFETY ISSUE -- ICE OF COURSE ONE TELL US EXACTLY HOW THEY GOT THIS INFORMATION -- DMV HAS TOLD US THAT IT IS NOT DIRECTLY FROM DMV BUT THEY HAVE TOLD US WHERE THIS INFORMATION GOES AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A BILL -- THAT PREVENTS ICE FROM FROM GETTING THAT DMV PHOTO AND INFORMATION -- FROM A DATABASE OF AT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A NAME AND THEY CAN SEARCH THAT DATABASE SO WHAT. I UNDERSTAND AND I AM AT MY FRUSTRATION I HOPE I DON'T SOUND TOO FRUSTRATED I. WE HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE SAYING THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S TO BROADER DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY WILL SOMEBODY TELL ME HOW IT WORKS. IN WE WILL. NARROWLY TAILOR. THIS BILL TO AVOID THAT RIGHT NOW WE THINK IF YOU HAVE AN ACTUAL WARRANT FOR SOMEBODY SO IF THEY'VE COMMITTED A CRIME% OKAY YOU CAN SEARCH THE DATABASE AND YOU UTILIZE. THE DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT'S IN THERE TO FIND THE PERSON THIS IS IF YOU HAVE. SIMPLY A DEPORTATION ORDER -- THAT YOU CAN'T GO IN AT AS ICE AND SEARCH THE DATABASE TO COME UP WITH THEIR CURRENT ADDRESS AND PICTURE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. FOR OTHERWISE LAW ABIDING IN -- RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- SO WITH THAT IT YOU KNOW I'LL CONTINUE TO DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE SHERIFF'S AND ANYONE ELSE THAT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- BECAUSE NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE AN ANSWER JUST -- PROTEST IN OUR ONLY OTHER ANSWER I WILL I WILL SAY AGAIN IS TO GO TO OUR COMMUNITY AND SAY YOU ARE PUTTING YOURSELF AT RISK BY GETTING AB SIXTY LICENSE. THAT IS NOT GOOD FOR ANY OF US SO. RESPECT LAST FROM ABOUT. THANK YOU -- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE. PEOPLE DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE THEN THAT ALSO IF THEY DO SO THEN THEY ALSO ARE NO LONGER OF FIGHTING BY OUR INSURANCE REQUIREMENT LAWS OR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS SO IT IS -- THAT THAT ALONE IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. AND CERTAINLY I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT. IN. THAT YOU HAVE ATTEMPTED TO NARROW IT SO THAT IT IS ONLY COVERING. THAT IF THERE IS A PERSON WHO HAS. COMMITTED A CRIME THAT THERE WAS STILL ACCESS TO THE DATABASE BUT IF THIS IS PURELY ACCESS JUST TO GET -- ADDRESSES ARE SUCH THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO RESTRICT SO I DO I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS TO SEE IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED -- AND I'LL SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS EITHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CENTER MOORLACH HI I'M I'M A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL -- BUT I'LL WAIT.
