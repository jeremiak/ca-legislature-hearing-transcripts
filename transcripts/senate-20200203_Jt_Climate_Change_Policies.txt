AFTERNOON WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND- GET STARTED IN OUR BY SIR SHOULD BE HERE ANY MOMENT NOW. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WHEN I WELCOME YOU ALL THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES. IT'S OUR SECOND ANNUAL EMISSIONS UPDATE FROM THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AS MANDATE ASSEMBLY. AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HOW TO THINK EVERYONE WHO'S TAKEN THE TIME TO PRESENT TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THOSE PRESENTATIONS AND PARTICIPATE IN THAT DISCUSSION. ALTHOUGH I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING ON TODAY'S AGENDA- AND HANDOUTS. WE'RE GOING TO BE- PROVIDING SOME INFORMATIONAL REPORT ON THE REPORTED GREENHOUSE GASES CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC CONTAMINANTS FROM ALL SECTORS COVERED BY THE AIR BE SCHOOL BEING PLAN AS A CARD BY AB ONE NINETY SEVEN. ADDITIONALLY THIS YEAR WILL FOCUS ON NEGATIVE GHG EMISSIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE TRACKED THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON STATEWIDE REDUCTION GOALS INCLUDING I DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE NEGATIVE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND ACHIEVING THEY'LL STATEWIDE GOALS AS WELL WHILE BE MINDFUL OUR OF OUR MOST BURNING COMMUNITIES ALONG THE WAY. I THINK INCLUDE WE WILL INVITE OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AND SINCE THE ISSUES RELATED TO GHG EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. ON AND SO IF YOU DO WISH TO MAKE COMMENTS PLEASE SIGN IN AT THE SERGEANTS TABLE. I'M GONNA BE KEEPING TIME OUR GOAL IS TO A GERM BY FOUR THIRTY BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO BE BUT- WE REALLY WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME HERE I GUESS WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT. AND SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD IN MATH OUR CHAIR MARY NICHOLS TO COME UP- AND GIVE HER TESTIMONY WITH THE COVER YET THAT WHEN MR STERN SO SUB I KNOW HE THIS YEAR TO BE PART OF THIS I MIGHT ENTER UP SOMEBODY TAKE A FEW MINUTES BUT OUT TO SEE THE AHEAD AND START SINCE WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE FOR DINNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AS YOU STATED- THIS OF LEGISLATION AB ONE NINETY SEVEN REQUIRES AN ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE CHAIR OF A R. B. AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW. WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND WHERE WERE HAD IT SO I'LL JUST LAUNCH RIGHT INTO IT AND- WHEN SENATOR STERN- BECOMESIF HE WANTS TO GO OVER ANY OF IT I'M- MORE THAN HAPPY TO WEAR. TO DO THAT TOO- SO. I WOULD LIKE TO. BEGIN WITH IS. WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND THEN TO. UP TO THE PRESENT AND PRESENT AND MAKE SOME CALM GOING FORWARD. AS YOU ALL KNOW OF CARBON CREATE OVER FIFTY AGO. WITH THE GOALS OF ATTAIN AND MAY. HEALTHY AIR QUALITY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM EXPOSURE TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS AND PROVIDING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES FOR COMPLYING WITH AIR POLLUTION- AND LATER WE WERE GIVEN THE TASK OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS WELL SO. MANY WITH. THE PARTS THAT HAVE PRODUCED OF THE FIRST ONE THE CRITERIA. AIR POLLUTANTS- LIST FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON KNOCKS DOCTOR CHEN OXIDES WHICH ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT OF SMALL THAT WE WORK ON TO TRY TO. PREVENT OZONE FORMATION AND- OF NOT. NOT IS ALSO A AGREE GAS WERE SO. TURNS OUT THAT OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN- MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THAT AS WELL. THE TERM HERE SHOWS A PROGRESS SINCE TWO BUT REALLY YOU COULD GO ACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND SHOW- CONTINUE WILL- A STEADY DECREASE DUE TO MULTIPLE REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED OVER TIME- BY CAR OF COURSE AND ALSO- BY THE US EPA AS WELL- THE MOBILE SOURCES ARE. RESPONSIBLE FOR BY FAR THE LARGEST SHARE OF KNOCKS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF OUR- ENGINE STANDARDS AS WELL AS OUR WORK TO CLEAN UP FEELS AND TO- TURN OVER THE FLEET WHICH IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. QUITE A LOT THROUGH- INCENTIVE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS IN THIS IS A SMALL ISHE CHART BUT IT HAS SIX OF THE- NASTY S. OF THE- ACCESS THAT WE DEAL WITH- AGAIN IT'S A IT'S A GOOD STORY GOOD PICTURE. AND IT'S IS THE REALLY. A PRIMARILY A RESULT OF CHAIN IN THE FUELS AND THEN THE EMISSIONS VIA. ALTHOUGH IN I FEEL THESE CASE WE ALSO HAVE VERY SOURCE BUT REGULATIONS WITH BURKE FLORA FLAME WHICH IS USED IN THE DRY. INDUSTRY PRIMARILY SOUTH BUT IF YOU LOOK AT DIESEL PARTICULATE WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST TOXIC AND IT'S THE ONE OVER IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER THAT'S PROBABLY BEEN FOCUS OF MORE OF OUR EFFORTS IN RECENT YEARS. BECAUSE THE EXPOSURE IS SO WIDE SPREAD- THROUGHOUT COMMUNITIES. IN ALL OF THESE EFFORTS- NOW WE'RE LOOKING TOWARDS THAT THE OVER ARCHING IMPORTANCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. HARVEST HAD THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARING SCOPINGPLANS AND FOR ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING- MOST OF THE REGULATIONS THAT COME UNDER THAT- UNDER THE SCOPING PLANTS AND WE'RE- VERY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED OUR TWENTY TWENTY TARGET WHICH IS UNUSUAL TO HAVE EXCEEDED THAT OF EXCEEDED OUR- REQUIREMENTS- BUT- WE WERE- HELPED. A LOT BY OTHER FORCES PARTICULARLY I WOULD SAY- THAT TRANSITION OF THE UTILITIES TO CLEANER RENEWABLE LECTRICITY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN WHICH IS THE ONE THAT WERE OPERATING UNDER NOW-CONTINUES THE APPROACH THAT WE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING. OF USING A MIX OF DIFFERENT MEASURES INCLUDING DIRECT REGULATIONS INCENTIVES AND THE MARKET BASED MECHANISM CALLED IN TO AID AS OF PUTTING THOSE TOGETHER TRY TO WHICH IF. BALANCE AND TO A GOALS AT THE- AT THE LOWEST COST FOR CALIFORNIANS OVERALL- IN ADDITION TO REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SEVERAL THE STRATEGIES THE SCOPE AND PLANTS. ARE ALSO A LOT THIS PART AFTER TO MEET NASH. BE AN ERROR THE STATE STAND AT IN WORDS FOR SEPT IN THE LOW. FUEL STAY AND THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD. DELIVERY CLEAN FUEL AND ENERGY AS WELL AS THE IN CLEAN CAR PRO. WHICH PUT MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THE SUSTAINABLE ACTION PLAN THAT IS MOVING FORWARD TOWARDS ITS ACT IMPLEMENTATION THAT WILL RESULT IN CLEANER SYSTEMS FOR MOVING GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND. OF COURSE WE HAVE THE AT FOR EVER STATE WHY THE ECONOMY WIDE CALF AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND NUMBER OF THESE ARE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED ALONG THE WAY FOR TO TRY TO GET THE GREATEST OF. FOR BILL. SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE PLANS AND INVEST WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ASSURING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PROGRAMS- WILL DELIVER BENEFITS BOTH AT HOME AND- ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ALL OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND IN YOUR HAND OUT YOU HAVE A LIST OF ALL THE DIFFERENT- REPORTING AND OVERSIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE CLIMATE PROGRAMS AND TO FOLLOW WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY JUST WANT TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES TALKING ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION IS FAR AND AWAY THE MOST IMPORTANT. SOURCE OF BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS I AM. MISSION SHE YOU THE SHARE IT EACH OF THE FOR A OF THESE TYPES OF A AND IT'S TO CONTINUE TO BE THE BEARER WHERE WE I WAS MOST OF A BECAUSE IT IS DOMINATED BY- NOT ONLY OUR PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION BUT ALSO- THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS INCLUDING TRUCKS BUSES FREIGHT EQUIPMENT LOCOMOTIVES MARINE VESSELS AND OTHER OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT SOME OF WHICH ARE REALLY ONLY ATTAINABLE BY THE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION RAILROADS FOR EXAMPLE THAT REMAIN ONE OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT- PROBLEMS TO TRY TO ADDRESS- AND BECAUSE DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER MAKES UP 30% OF ALL THE PARTICULATE MATTER- FROM- THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. THIS IS- NOT A CRITERIA POLLUTANT IT'S ONLY LISTED AS A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT BUT WE HAVE HAD- CONTINUAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE- THE PIONEERING COMMUNITIES IN OUR AB SIX SEVENTEEN AT PROGRAM AND WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THE COMMUNITIES AND A VERY CLEAR VOICE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE US- MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES A SOLUTION NOT FOR GLOBAL WAR BUT FOR THE GROUND LEVEL POLLUTION THAT THE EXPERIENCE THERE IN THE IN. THE INTERIM SALUTE THEM FOR ME TECHNOLOGIES THEY WILL TO SEE A ARE THEY WANT TO SEE US MAP. SO WITH THAT IN MY- HI I THINK WHAT I TO SAY IS WE ARE HAVE TO PURSUE SOME NEW AND MORE AGGRESSIVE STRAY. THAT RAPIDLY A IS THERE EMISSION TECHNO. AND ALSO TO RE MOBY PATTERN TO RID THE ONE TRAVELED FOR AS LONG AS WE CAN TO HAVE COMBUSTION THE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NEEDED TO MEET OUR SB THIRTY TWO CLIMATE CHART TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY AS WELL AS- TO GET TO THAT CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL OF THE STATE IS SET FOR TWENTY FOUR AND FIVE. SIX AT THAT LETTER BE REQUIRED NOT THAT WE CAN GET. OUT BUSINESS AT HE WAS SO. IN ORDER TO GET THAT LOVE OF. WE'RE NEED TO ASSURE THAT EVERYBODY AND CAL. HAS ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER AS WELL AS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE AB FUELS ROADS AND COMMUNICATIONS AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WORK TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES THAT IMPROVE PEOPLE'S TRAVEL CHOICES AND REDUCE THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED OR VMT. WE'VE MADE PROGRESS AS MY CHARTS HAVE SHOWED DESPITE THE LACK OF. IN THE COMPLETE ACTION ON TRADE SO LIKE SHIPS. AND TRUCKS AND WELL AS THE END IN V. MY TRAVELED WHICH MEANS TRANSIT EMISSIONS ARE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND OUR JOB IS GOTTEN HARDER BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL SAFE FOR ALL THAT- TOOK AWAY CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY TO REQUIRES ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OR TO REGULATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM- MOTOR VEHICLES. HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE'VE ALSO BEEN SO WILLING TO RESTORE OUR A RIGHT TO THE ACT- BUTEVEN WITH FULL COOPERATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT WE WOULD STILL NOT HAVE. EVERYTHING WE NEED WE HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON TRANSPORTATION AND STRIVE FOR A FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA CAN ATTAIN THE KINDS OF- TOTALLY EMISSIONS FREE- LIFE THAT. IS WHAT IS WHAT IS NEEDED YOU KNOW. I CAN'T HELP BUT SAY THAT- IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND WORKING TO DRIVE DOWN EMISSIONS AND DURING THAT TIME IT'S IMPRESSIVE WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AND WE'RE LOOKING TO BUY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD BECAUSE OF THAT. YES BUT IT TOOK. FIFTY TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT ALSO MAINTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND I'M AND WE'VE KNOWN FOR ALMOST LOG THAT THE SAME AMBITIONS WHICH ARE COST BY BURNING UP. FEEL ARE ALSO WERE IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TO WARM THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT NEW INFORMATION THATWE SOME SAVE AND DEALT WITH. KING AND THEN IN NUMBER OF SAM TO. CAN TO WILL A- STILL MAINTAIN OUR PA% GROWTH OUR ACTON GROWTH. AND THOSE ARE. BUT. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO REACH OUR GOAL OF THAT PACE. VACATION AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE KNOW ARE ALWAYS WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ENLIST THE SUPPORT OF EVERYBODY WHO HAS A ROLE- INCLUDING NOT ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN PARTICULAR. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN INTEREST IN THOSE AREAS. TO ACHIEVE THIS NEW PARADIGM WE'RE GONNA NEED A NUMBER OF NEW- TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION WITH A 100% OF A LECTERN PASSENGER VEHICLE SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND A COMPLETE TURNOVER OF VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THESE ARE JUST WHAT THE MODEL SHOT WITH SOME OF THE- ON A GOAL THAT WE- MADE UP BECAUSE IT WE THINK IT'S NOW TO. IT'S A GOAL THAT MAY. OUR SHOWS ONLY WAY THINK WE CAN MEET THE STANDARDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET. WE NEED TO HAVE SUSTAINED INVESTMENTS AND POLICIES THAT WE CAN- MAINTAIN OVER TIME- AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE. VERY CLOSE TO A TIPPING POINT FOR COMMERCIALIZATION FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND DECLINING AND AS INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANDS WE ARE ALREADY WITH. ARE BEGINNING TO SEE THE TRAJECTORY TO REACH ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND IT SURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CUT ACROSS MULTIPLE MODES OF TRAVEL. IT'S GOING TO. BE THAT A BIG PART OF THE TASK BUT TECHNOLOGY ALONE IT'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE A LOT OF. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OUT THERE IN SOME SOURCES WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO- TO REPLACE SO. INVESTING IN ALTERNATIVES- INCLUDING. GREAT MUCH GREATER ACCESS TO TRANSIT IS ALSO VERY CLEAN- COMPLETE STREETS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS A WALKING AND BIKING AS WELL AS PROGRAMS TO REDUCE THE NEED TO COMMUTE. ARE ALL THINGS THAT THAT HAVE TO BE DONE AND AGAIN PROVIDE A MORE INTEGRATED DO SEND TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS PLANNING THAT INCREASES AT THAT. I MEAN THAT WILL INCREASE THE RANGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THESE THINGS ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO EACH OTHER AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ASKING- COLLEAGUE. EVEN CLIMATE ADVICE. KATE CORD TO TALK MORE THAT IN A BIT BUT AT THE HEART OF A LOT OF THIS IT REMAINS THE INEQUITIES THAT KEEP PEOPLE FROM- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES OR FROM A FORTY HOUSING AND PLACES THAT'S CLOSER TO WHERE THEY WORK AND TOO- OTHER KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT. YOU NEED AND SO PUTTING IN PLACE HIGH QUALITY TRAVEL AND HOUSING OPTIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS WILL BE NECESSARY. I FELT REALLY GOOD. SORRY OKAY GOT IT- I AM A I MISIDENTIFIED TWO WOULD BE SPEAKING FOR A OPR ACTUALLY IS IT WILL BE RELEASED BACK WORTH- SO I JUST WANT TO QUICKLY SAY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ME AND I THERE ARE A LOT OF WORDS ON THESE PAGES THAT WITH THE EASE THAT GO WITH THESE LIGHTS- THAT AMONG THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF WHAT A RB IS ALREADY. ABLE TO DO OR IS REQUIRED TO DO INCLUDE STRENGTHENING OUR GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING. THE OUT PLANS THAT COMMUNITIES DEVELOP UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE- THIS IS GOING THROUGH THE- AND PO'S. WE'RE DEVELOPING ARE CLEAN MILES STANDARD REGULATION UNDER SB TEN FOURTEEN WHICH IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM RIDE HAILING COMPANIES. LIKE UBER AND LEFT- BY GETTING THEM INVOLVED IN ELECTRIFICATION AND PULLING AND OTHER MEASURES. AND WE ARE LOOKING OUT WHERE EVER WE HAVE DISCRETION IN FUNDING. TO INCREASE THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND DISADVANTAGED CAN TODAY'S INCLUDING A NEW PILOT PROJECT THIS YEAR. CALL THE SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECT OR STEP. THAT WILL PROVIDE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. TO FUND INTEGRATED LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY. NEEDS BUT- CARP OBVIOUSLY CANNOT DO THIS ON ITS OWN. IT WE HAVE TO BE OR DATING ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT. WELL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN PARTICULAR ARE KEY TO INFLUENCING HOW COMMUNITIES ARE BUILT AND WHAT TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. SO LOOKING TO TRY TO FIND WAYS TO REQUIRE THAT TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN PLANS. WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW THEY MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN WAYS THAT REDUCE OVERALL NEEDS TO DROP FIVE AND THE SENATE. HOUSING IN. FILL YES THAT'S CLOSE TO TRANSIT AND JOB UNDER. WELL AS LOOK AT WAYS TO IMPROVE. THEIR. ABILITY AS A AS A AS- AN- YEAH. WE NEED TO LOOK WE EVEN BE ON THE ACT THAT WERE TAKING NOW TOWARDS THE GOAL OF CARBON NEW AND THAT IS SO A STEP. WHAT MOST OF OUR EXISTING PLANS AND PROGRAMS HAVE THOUGHT TO DO- BECAUSE IN ORDER TO STABILIZE CLIMATE THE CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT ARE GENERATED NOT JUST BY VEHICLES BUT ALSO BY POWER PLANTS INDUSTRIAL PROCESS SEES AS WELL AS BY- ARE ARE NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS MUST BE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF CARBON DIOXIDE THAT IS REMOVED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THERE WAS OUR SPECIAL REPORT ISSUED IN LATE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY THE- YOU AND I. P. C. C. PANEL SHOWED THAT IN ORDER TO LIMIT GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASES TO ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS WE WOULD NEED TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY GLOBALLY TO AVOID THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE I IT'S VERY SAY THAT FAR FROM. AND GIVEN WHAT'S GOING ON MAY OTHER OF WORLD THE CALL THESE KIND OF MAY NOW AS THOUGH THEY BE OUT OF OUT OF REACH I WE KNOW THAT WHEN IN CAL ARE PULLED. DEMONSTRATE THE AVAILABILITY OF AT. AND TO SHOW THEY CAN BE TO. IN WAYS THAT ARE. FOR AND ACTUALLY GENERATE I CAN INVESTMENT THAT WE CAN LEAD THE WAY AND GET OTHERS TO JOIN WITH US IN THESE IN THESE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES. I WANT TO MENTION IN THAT REGARD A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON WITH RESPECT TO CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION AS WELL AS DIRECT AIR CAPTURE OF CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AS WELL- FIRST OUR BOARD ADOPTED A PROTOCOL FOR USE IN THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THAT IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO ATTRACT SOME ATTENTION FROM- INDUSTRIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO. DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE'S TECHNOLOGY TO CAPTURE AND STORE CARBON FROM- OIL REFINERY OR CEMENT AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES. ARE THERE A NUMBER OF VERY SMALL AT THAT MOMENT PILOT PROJECTS. LOOKING AT RACK AIR TOP CO TWO BUT AGAIN THIS TO BE A LAW OF WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE THIS TECH. SCALABLE AND ECONOMIC WE NEED TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF LOOKING AT THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN- PIONEER SOME OF THEM. AND AGAIN OUR NATURAL LANDS ALSO NEED TO BE GIVEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO BECOME- THE KIND OF CARBON SINKS THAT THEY NEED TO BE THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT AND WORKING ON BUT AS YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF OUR AT CURRENT LEVELS OF- OF A BUILDUP OF GREENHOUSE GASES HAS BEEN. THAT WHERE MORE FIRE PRONE AND THAT OUR FIRES ARE LARGER AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN THEY USED TO BE- WE AT A R. B. HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. THINKING ABOUT A LOOKING AT FIRE AND THE ROLE OF CO TWO FROM BUYERS. AT ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS EFFECTS OF FIRES IN NEAR ANY COMMUNITY EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY DIRECTLY IN THE LINE OF THE DESTRUCTION IS THE EFFECT OF SMOKE AND WHAT IT DOES TO PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO BREATHE. IT'S SCARY AND IT'S AWFUL- WE NEED TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN SAFELY ALLOW FOR BURNING ON LANDS WHERE THE ONLY WAY TO STORE THE HEALTH OF THE FOREST IS TO ALLOW BURNING A PAST COMBINED OTHER. BETTER MANAGEMENT OF FIRES BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT LEVY A PART OF OUR JOB IS BEING TO FIND WAYS TO ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE. THE KIND OF MEANING THAT THE TWO BANDS CATASTROPHIC. WHAT FIRES DURING THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THE HAND OUT ABOUT FIRE I THINK I'M GOING TO SKIP. READING THIS PART OF THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE IT'S EASIER FOR YOU TO READ IT FOR YOURSELF THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED TO TOUCH ON IN THIS THAT YOU VAST. IS ISSUE OF ACCOUNTING. BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA WHERE FRANKLY IS A IN THE WORLD- WHEN IT COMES TO. HAVING A RIGOROUS AND CREDIBLE SYSTEM FOR ACCOUNTING FOR EMISSIONS AND THAT IS THE BEDROCK UPON WHICH ALL OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS NEED TO REST BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY FOR REGULATED INDUSTRY OR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE REDUCTIONS THAT WERE GENERATING BY OUR PROGRAMS ARE REAL SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR DECADES NOW TO USE SCIENCE. TO PURSUE POLICIES AND PUT IN THE RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT OUR ACCOUNTING IS ACCURATE A AND VERIFIABLE BOTH AB THIRTY TWO AND SB THIRTY TWO FOCUSED ON REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM THE FOSSEL SECTOR AND THOSE INVENTORIES ONLY INCLUDE ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRIAL EMISSIONS WE AT CARP HAVE SEPARATELY PUBLISHED A NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY WHICH INCLUDES THE WILDFIRE EMISSIONS THAT ARE. DEPICTED ON THE SLIDES THAT YOU HAVE BUT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM A NATURAL DISASTER LIKE WILD FIRES SHOULD NOT BE MEASURED OR- POOLED TOGETHER WITH EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM- THE SOURCES THAT ARE ANTHROPOGENIC THAT WE CAUSE URSELVES NATURAL DISASTERS THAT A BIT GREENHOUSE GASES SUCH AS WILD FIRES AND FOREST FIRES. HAVE BEEN OCCURRING SINCE LONG BEFORE CLIMATE CHANGE WAS NOTICED AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR AS CLIMATE CONTINUES TO CHANGE AND WILL PERSIST EVEN IF WE WERE ULTIMATELY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WHILE SCIENCE CAN NOW CONCLUSIVELY ATTRIBUTE INDIVIDUAL EXTREME ADVANCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND DETERMINE WHAT TYPES OF EVENTS ARE MADE WORSE BY CLIMATE CHANGE SUCH AS HURRICANE SIX. BOTH MARTIN TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THESE OF ARE A SYMPTOM OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ARE NOT TO BE- INCLUDED- WHEN IT COMES TO FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS IS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS ANTHROPOGENIC MEANING THAT WE HUMANS HAVE BECAUSE THESE EIGHT CONCENTRATIONS TO INCREASE AND THEREFORE WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASES AND THE MORE EXTREME VERSION OF EVENTS THAT THIS CAUSES SEC SO. THIS IS WHERE WE INTEND TO KEEP ON PUTTING OUR ENERGY AND WHERE WE THINK WE CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA SO- IN CONCLUSION OF LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO CONVENE OF ON THIS SECOND ANNUAL REPORT OF AB ONE NINETY SEVEN AND- TO JUST TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE FIRST ADOPTED AB THIRTY TWO AND TWO THOUSAND SIX AS WELL AS THE RENEWABLE ORTFOLIO STANDARD LEGISLATION. THERE WERE WALKS PREDICTIONS THAT THOSE GOALS WERE NOT ACHIEVABLE AND THAT THEY WOULD BE TO COST AND SEND THE FATE OF THE WRONG DIRECTION NOW WE KNOW I'M ONLY A FEW SHORT YEARS LATE. THAT THOSE PROJECT THIS WRONG THAT WE WERE RIGHT TO CONTRA. IN THE ABILITY OF OUR OUR SCIENTISTS AND ARE INVENTORS AND OUR OUR CITIZENS- TO. MAKE PROGRESS AND TO UP PUT THEIR MINDS TO SUCCEEDING AND WE'VE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO INCREASE- TO IT THE CARBONIZED OUR ELECTRICITY GOAL AS WELL AS TO CONTINUE OUR WORK ON REDUCING OUR AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES. BUT FRANKLY I THINK WE WOULD BE WRONG TO RELY ON THE PAST SUCCESS TO ASSUME THAT WE CAN MAKE IT TO OUR TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE CLIMATE GOALS. BECAUSE THESE ARE MUCH HARDER TO ACHIEVE AN AUNT BECAUSE FRANKLY DONNELLY IN WASHINGTON BUT IN OTHER MAJOR EMITTING COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THE POLITICALWILL TO ACT IS NOT. EVIDENT IN FACT THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE ARE LESS WILLING TO COLLABORATE AND COOPERATE THAT SEEM TO BE. WHEN WE MET LEAD MEETINGS THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD MET. IN PARIS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- EVEN IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN BEATING BACK THE ATTACKS ON CALIFORNIA'S AUTHORITY WHICH WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULD EIGHT NEVER THE LESS WE CAN'T JUST DO IT BY OURSELVES SO. I THINK THAT OUR GREATEST HOPE LIES IN MAKING OURSELVES. IF YOU. TRAIN OUR SYSTEM TO ONE WE BUILD AROUND A RE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND- THE HOUSING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THAT SIMPLY DOWN IN THAT GREENHOUSE GASES AT ALL AND THAT WE FIND WAYS TO TAKE THE- ACCESSES THAT WE KNOW ARE GOING TO EXIST BECAUSE THERE WILL BE ACTIVITIES THAT AN ARRAY CO TWO OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE I THINK WE SHOULD GOOD IN THAT REGARD. HE MADE OF. OTHER TIME WHEN YOU KNOW HE HAVE FACED REALLY EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES AND DANGERS AND RECOGNIZE THAT- SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT- CONTINUE TO HOLD OFF AND TWO HALF MEASURES THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE ACTION THAT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES SO. THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT IS BEFORE ALL OF US IT'S YOURS AS AS WELL AS OURS AND- I AM. VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE THE WILL THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE. IT IS OUR STATE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WHO TELL US REGULARLY- HOW IN INSTANT THEY ARE THAT WE ACT AND THE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON A THESE CHAT WHICH IS WITH THANK YOU. I THINK THAT UNDER TO HAVE OUR VICE CHAIR GIVES THEM OPENING COMMENTS AND HILL START OFF THE QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL- CALL MISTER MONEY NEXT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I GUESS MY COMMENTS- JUST KEEP VERY BRIEF AND THAT. AB WE APPRECIATE THE STEADINESS AND LEADERSHIP WE'VE HAD THE AIRBOARD THROUGH MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATION SO. THANK YOU CHAIR NICHOLS FOR REMAINING- IN PUBLIC SERVICE TRY STEADIEST THROUGH SOME VERY. YEAH I WANT TO IN THE GOOD TIMES ARE COMING AYE AYE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE IT JUST KEEPS THE DARK TIMES JUST SEEM TO KEEP- UNFOLDING- AND WE WENT THROUGH IT ALL OVER THE FALL- IN VERY REAL TIME. PEOPLE'S COMMUNITIES KEEP BURNING DOWN AN- HOUR GOES OFF FOR. HOW MANY MORE KIDS WENT TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE OF THEIR ASTHMA. WE KNOW THESE IMPACTS WELL BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH IN MY MIND TO. QUANTIFY THE TRUE FISCAL RISK AROUND THEM EITHER AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPRECIATE SOME OF THE AIR STUDIES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF. TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WE FACES STATE IN ALL THESE COSTS BUT I'M HOPING THIS YEAR WE CAN. REALLY SCREW UP TO THE FISCAL RISK THAT CLIMATE POSES TO THE STATE AND OUR BUDGET AS A WHOLE- I WANTED TO ASK YOU JUST BRIEFLY. YES TWO CENTRAL QUESTIONS- ONE OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND WHETHER YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE MARKET THERE- YOU KNOW EL CFS IS DRIVING A LOT OF THE BEHAVIOR ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE RIGHT NOW. BUT I STILL I MEAN WHEN THE PUBLIC AT LEAST LOOKS WHO AREN'T TRADERS AN ART TRADE OF UP TO SPEED ON. THE ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION SCHEMES WHEN THEY SEE SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A TON. AND WHERE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK WAS SOCIAL COST OF CARBON THEIR STUDY THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A TIME AND NOW I THINK MOST RECENT NOW SEE SHOW ABOUT SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS A TON- IS OUR PRICE ON CARBON ACCURATELY REFLECTING. THE TRUE SOCIAL COSTS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. THE PRICE OF ALLOWANCES SO THE FLOOR PRICE EVEN WITH THE ADDER THAT THE MARKET IS NOW PUTTING ON AT BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER TRADING AT JUST THE FLOOR OR WHERE IT CONSISTENTLY. A BIT ABOVE THE FLOOR- IN- THE OPTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HOLDING- DOES NOT REFLECT THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON AND RECENT WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE. ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE INDICATES THAT PROBABLY THE NUMBERS THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING OUT ARE ALSO LOW- BECAUSE THE- THE MODELING AND THE CURRENT INFORMATION CLEARLY I SHOWING THAT. THE BUILD UP OF GASES AND THE- DAMAGE BEING CAUSED IS GREATER IT'S COMING FASTER I GUESS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO PUT THAT THE THINGS THAT. PEOPLE WERE PREDICTING WHAT HAPPENED BY THE END OF THE CENTURY ARE HAPPENING EARLY IN THE CENTURY INSTEAD SO- THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT TWENTY DOLLARS OF THàNH IS THE RIGHT. PRICE FOR CARBON THE REASON WHY THE SET THE PRICES AS WE DID IT AT THE TIME KNEW THAT THAT THE BY TO BE. REAL THE FOR CALL OF THE DAY OUT JEFF OUR- OF GLOBAL WAR. FOR MANY. WAS THE WE WERE TO SHOW. COULD HAVE A CAP ON TO THIS THE ALL NO THOUGHT OF THE TIME. THAT WOULD PERTAIN. OF PRODUCE UP OUR PRO. WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE ACT. READ OF. EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT MARKETS WAS ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW STATE COULD EVEN DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO OUR GOAL WAS TO. CREATE A SYSTEM WHICH WAS- DURABLE AND- COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT- FRANKLY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SUBJECT TO IT WHICH SHOULD MAINLY WAS THE REFINERS ON THE POWER PLANTS AND- AND DRIVERS WHO. BY GASOLINE- COULD LIVE WITH THAT IT WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD HAVE RESULTS IT WOULD WORK BUT IT WOULDN'T. BE SO- ONEROUS THAT IT WOULD EITHER DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVELY OR OR HEARD OUR CONSUMERS AND I THINK WE DROVE DOWN A LINE THERE- AND- AND WE DID IT I FEEL LIKE WE DID IT VERY WELL AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD THIS. ROBOT SYSTEM WITH A CALLBACK ALTHOUGH THAT'S ALSO BEING CHALLENGED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW HAS ALSO BEEN A PROOF THAT WE CAN'T EVEN DO THIS THE CRUX OF. THE BUT INTERNATIONAL BOUNDARY BUT HAVING SAID THAT. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD AND YOU THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM TO DROP FIVE MORE REDUCTIONS. WE'RE GOING TO. TAKE TO SEE THAT GOES UP THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU COULD DO THAT YOU CAN PUT A ON. THROUGH ATTACK IT OF THAT'S A BEEN AN IDEA THAT MEN PEOPLE THE YEARS HAVE HAVE THOUGHT WAS A BETTER FAIRER SYSTEM. SO YOU KNOW WE ALL AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE- WE LOOKED AT THE CARBON I JUST- IN IN REGARD TO THE CAP AND TRADE PRICE THAT. WE SAW THAT IS BEING ADDED ON TO THE COST OF THAT- CONSUMERS WOULD BE PAYING TO MEET OUR OTHER REGULATORY- PROGRAMS AS WELL SO THIS MIXED PROGRAM THAT WE HAD. WITH THE EMISSION STANDARDS FOR THE VEHICLES AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARDS ETCETERA IT ALL AGAIN TOGETHER SO. AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE COST OF CARBON BUT- A WE CHANGE OR IF AND WHEN WE CHANGE THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM AS THE MAN TO CLOSE TO BECAUSE I THINK. IS A THAT CAN HAVE TO DISCUSS AS WE DEVELOP THE NEXT COPING. IS FOR THAT I THINK THROUGH THE- THIS OAK POPPING UP EVEN THROUGH THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE AN ISSUE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CLIMATE BUDGET HEARING THE SENATE. OR ST TWO WEEKS EVERY TEN DAYS OR SO. SO WE'LL PROBABLY BE TRAILING DOWN ON THAT FURTHER AND NOT TO SAY THAT THE PURPOSE OF. OUR EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAM IS TO GENERATE REVENUE. IT'S BEING LOOKED AT THAT THAT WAY BUT IT'S IT INTENDED TO. BUILD CERTAINTY AND- SOME KIND OF BACKSTOP ON THE SYSTEM BUT WE'RE GONNA BE RELYING ON A MORE AND MORE. COURT THAT THE MODELS ARE RIGHT- TO DRIVE BROADER EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS SO. LOOK FOR ENGAGING WITH YOU ON THAT THE ONE OTHER THING I WANT TO ASK- IS THE- STRUCK BY YOUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS ANALYSIS. AND I'M WONDERING WHERE WE WOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE TRAJECTORY TO HITTING OUR SB THIRTY TWO GOALS IF WE ACTUALLY DID ACCOUNT FOR EMISSIONS FROM THE NATIONAL IN WORKING LAND SECTOR SO SAVING INVENTORY WAS. WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER COMPLETE CONSIDERED SORT OF A IT'S ONE IT'S ONE SLICE OF THE INVENTORY RIGHT NOW BUT IF WE SAID OKAY WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT. FUGITIVE EMISSIONS NETWORKING LANCE. HOW ARE WE HOW FAR. BEHIND ARE WE- IF WE LOOK AT THINGS. THROUGH THAT LENS AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO BE A DOWNER HERE TO ONE WELL IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EQUAL TO BUT IT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER IT'S A BIG NUMBER- CLOSER TO. WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TARGETING WITH THE EXISTING REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS OF COURSE WHY I'M- EMPHASIZING SO MUCH YEAH THEY NEED TO GET AFTER. WAYS TO CAPTURE AND RE USE OR STORE KERR BUT CAN WE COUNT THE SAME WAY I KNOW I BECAUSE I KEEP THINKING. OKAY WE NEED A THE- EARLY STAGE INVENTORY LIKE BYRON SHEER DID THAT THEN LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME KIND OF MARKET. IS THAT THE WRONG WAY TO BE THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS IN THE NATURAL WORKING LANCE BASS OR DO YOU THINK THE SCIENCE IS SOLID ENOUGH THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN GET. AN ACCURATE INVENTORY SO WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WHEN WE INVEST IN THIS WETLANDS RESTORATION PROJECT OR A RICE FIELD CONVERSION OR A FORCE% MANAGEMENT PROJECT THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AT LEAST. SOME ACCURATE BASELINE THERE AND SOME CERTAINTY I WOULD JUST SO YES AND NO MY SIMPLISTIC ANSWER TO THAT IS. WE PROBABLY- OVER CREDIT HAVE CERTAIN WE ARE ABOUT EMISSIONS FROM WHAT WE THINK OF AS CONVENTIONAL SOURCES COMBUSTION THAT FUELS. BUT WE CAN'T PUT ON THE MONITOR ON A STACK AND ACTUALLY MEASURE THE CO TWO COMING OUT OF THAT SACK. AND YOU CAN YOU CAN HEAR THAT UP WITH- THE FUEL THAT'S GOING INTO THE THAT SAME. CALL IT AND THE CARBON. OF THE FUEL. ROB VERY WELL SO WE CAN FEEL QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WE KNOW WHAT THOSE EMISSIONS ARE WHEN IT COMES TO- FUGITIVE EMISSIONS BURNING- IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT ESTIMATING- BUT THE TECHNIQUES FOR EXAMPLE- MEASURING THAT IT USING- INFRARED TECHNOLOGY TO MEASURE WHAT'S GOING ON OVER A WHOLE FOREST AREA- HAVE IMPROVED REALLY DRAMATICALLY SO THAT- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF MORE THAN JUST A GAS OR A- ORDER VALUE TO THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW. WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU COULD APPROPRIATELY SAY A PARTICULAR REGULATION OR A PARTICULAR- TYPE OF- CREDITING PROGRAM FOR IMPROVE FOREST PRACTICES WOULD ACHIEVE RESULTS AND YOU'D BE PRETTY YOU'D BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT THOSE WERE WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF ACCURACY. SO I'LL JUST WRAPPED THEN WITH THIS WAY TELL ME IF I'M I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR COMMENT RIGHT. WE CAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON POWER FUELS BUILDINGS SORT OF THESE TRADITIONAL DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SOURCES BUT IF WE LEAVE. NATURAL WORKING LANDS FUGITIVE MISSIONS THAT SECTOR WE'RE REALLY ONLY TALKING ABOUT ROUGHLY HALF OF THE PROBLEM IS IT I MEAN ROUGH ROUGHLY HALF. THAT YOU GOT IT THANKS THANK YOU. CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF FOR CONVENING IN MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE TODAY IN YOUR WORK EVERY DAY- LEADING CARBON KEEPING US FOCUSED- I WANT TO PICK UP ON SENATOR STERN'S QUESTION ABOUT THE PRICE OF ALLOWANCES NEWMAN MENTIONED YOU AGREED THAT WE UNDER PRICE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF IMPACTS AND COSTS IN YOU SAID IT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT IN THE NEXT SCOPING PLAN. WHAT'S THE TIMETABLE FOR THAT IN. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. CARP HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ADJUST THE PRICING ON THESE ANNOUNCES THAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS THAT ACCURATE YES YES- I THINK THAT- THE WORKSHOPS THAT ARE UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW THE CARD IS CONVENING ARE ALREADY AT ELICITING A LOT OF RESPONSE. AND IDEAS FROM REGULATED INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS FROM SCIENTISTS AND ACADEMICS AND A AND MEMBERS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ABOUT WHAT IDEAS THEY'D LIKE TO SEE PURSUED IN THE NEXT PLAN CLEARLY WE DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE A TAX THAT IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE COULD DO- AND PRICING. UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM IF WE WERE TO RAISE THE FLOOR PRICE WE WOULD HAVE TO- GO THROUGH- YOU KNOW HOLE I NOTICE AND RULE MAKING PROCEEDING AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE HOPE IS A DECLINING POOL. OF ENTERED THERE AND PART OF WHAT THE DILEMMAS I THINK BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S A QUOTA ECONOMY WIDE TO CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IT REALLY DIRECTLY IMPACTS ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO AFTER BY ALLOWANCES AND THAT'S A SEVEN HUNDRED. ENTITIES ROUGHLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE TO GO BUY ALLOWANCES WHEN I- TURN ON MY GAS WATER HEATER WHICH I STILL HAVE YOU KNOW THAT SORT OF THIN SO IF WE WERE TO STARTED TO ROLL DOWN. TOGETHER AT THE SMALLER- SOURCES- WE WOULD HAVE TO ALSO EXPAND THE COVERAGE OF THE PROGRAM AND THE WAY THE PROGRAM OPERATES SO THAT'S AN OPTION YEAH BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY ONE. THANK YOU. AND I THINK THE OVER ARCHING THEME OF YOUR PRESENTATION IS. THE INCREASED URGENCY OF THE CRISIS OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS- AND- WELL WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE IN CALIFORNIA. AS CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN WE'RE DOING NOW. I THINK IT'S- IN YOUR TESTIMONY AND IT'S KIND OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT WERE. DOING A RELATIVELY GOOD JOB ON RENEWABLES IN AND DEVELOPING. THOSE RESOURCES AND MARKETS BUT IT'S ON THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WHERE WERE FACING OUR CHALLENGE YOU ALSO REFERENCED. BUILDING COMMUNITIES AND HOUSING. COULD YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT NEXUS OF HOW WE GET PEOPLE OUT OF CARS AND HOW DOES THAT LINK TO HOUSING POLICY AND- WHAT ROLE. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IT'S NOT BEING DONE TO INCENTIVIZE IN WHERE NECESSARY REQUIRING MANDATE- MORE INFILL HOUSING AND- MULTI FAMILY HOUSING OPTIONS CENTER WELL I I'M KIND OF TAKING OFF- THE THING IS THAT ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY'RE ALL THEY'RE ALL LINKED AND IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHICH IS THE CHICKEN AND WHICH IS THE AG- IF THERE ISN'T AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PEOPLE WILL LEAVE THE STATE ULTIMATELY IF THEY CAN'T FIND A PLACES TO LIVE- IF WE DON'T HAVE- HOUSING THAT ENABLES PEOPLE TO GET TO WORK WITHOUT A SPENDING HOURS- STUCK IN TRAFFIC WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND WE'RE ALSO INCREASING EMISSIONS AS THEY- ARE SITTING PARKED IN TRAFFIC AND- EMITTING- GREENHOUSE GASES- IF WE CAN'T HAVE- OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD PREFER TO LIVE A HEALTHIER LIFE- SO THAT THEY CAN WALK. AND OR VIEWS CALLS OR OTHER COMPLETELY EMISSIONS FREE BENEFITS TO GET TO WHERE WHEREVER IT IS THEY WANT TO GO WE ALSO OFFER IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL AS IN OUR HEALTH SO YOU KNOW WHERE EVER YOU PICK UP. THE THREAD HERE IT ALL IT CONNECTS BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR IT. IS OUR KIND OF OVER ARE BEING NATURE OF WHETHER WE'RE SUCCESSFULLY NOT IF YOU WERE TO ASK QUESTIONS YOU PUT AN ALERT IN. A HIGH SPEED RAIL OR COLOR AND SIZE HOW DOPPLER INTO TURNING OVER THE VEHICLE PLATE I COULDN'T REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED. ALL THOSE. THANK YOU WILL IT IS OPTION IT I THINK. IN MY WE HAVE A HUGE PERCENT OF WERE FORCE DRY IN LITERALLY HOURS FROM. SOMETIME SUB STANDARD HOW TO JOB IN A WITH UNATTAINABLE IN ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS COMPLICATED MATRIX INCLUDES PUBLIC TRANSIT. IF THERE WERE AN INCREASE IN ALLOWANCES THAT GENERATED EVEN A EVEN A RELATIVELY MINOR INCREASE THAT WOULD GENERATE MORE MONEY THAT WE OUR VISION IS TO INVEST THOSE REVENUES IN CARBON REDUCING. ACTIVITIES SOARING LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR PEOPLE WHETHER IT'S TO ACCESS SEWER ON. HAS ANYONE GIVEN THOUGHT TO PROVIDING FREE PASSES FOR PEOPLE THAT USE PUBLIC TRANSIT USING. G. G. R. F. REVENUES OR AN INCREASED ALLOWANCE TO FUND. PUBLIC ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC MEASURE THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT BUT IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED OVER TIME I THINK- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT EVEN GIVING FREE PASSES TO PEOPLE TO USE TRANSIT DONE. DON'T NECESSARILY ACCOMPLISH THE RESULT IF THE BUS DOESN'T COME NEAR WHERE YOU WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO YOU KNOW WE HAVE PEOPLE- OF LOS ANGELES WHO HAVE TO. CALL A LIFTER RIGHT UBER CAR WHEN THEY GET OFF THEIR JOB YOU KNOW ON THE LATE SHIFT AND THE BUS STOPS TOO FAR AWAY FROM THEIR HOUSE AND IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO GET FROM WHERE THE BUS STOP IS TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING HOME. I'D I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND AS GLOOMY ABOUT THAT- OPTION SO MUCH AS TO SAY THAT I THINK WE REALLY DO NEED A SORT OF A- OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- THE PERSON WHO IS A COMMUTING FROM A SUB STANDARD HOUSING IF IT'S THE RURAL HOUSING- THAT'S YOU KNOW PEOPLE TO. CLOSER TO THE EDGE OF THE FORESTED LAND IS AT ANOTHER WORLD OF HURT IF THEY'RE ALSO RUNNING THE RISK OF HAVING THEIR PLACE BURNED DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S TOO CLOSE TO THE FIRE AREA SO IT'S LIKE. WHERE DO YOU WHERE DO YOU BEGIN I THINK YOU BEGIN BY SAYING WHAT IS TAKE TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY THAT'S A LOW CARB AND COMMUNITY AND THEN TRY TO COME WITH A RATE OF MEASURES THANK YOU AND THEN I KNOW THERE'S HAVE QUESTIONS OF YOU KNOW. QUESTION ANSWER MR PART PRESS. YOU TO DRAW THEN. LITIGATION IN THE- WAIVER ON ARMY STAND IF AMISH STANDARD. COULD YOU IF YOU DO JUST STICK STEP FOR ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU'RE ABLE TO THAT WERE STILL IN THE STATE OF A OF LITIGATION THE- RULE- CAME OUT TO- JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND WE WENT TO COURT TO CHALLENGE IT AND BRIEFING IS GOING ON THE ROLE THAT OF THE SECOND PART OF THAT RULE WHICH IS THE ONE THAT. CHANGES THE OBAMA STANDARDS AND EITHER FREEZES THEM MORE MAKES THEM MUCH LESS STRINGENT IS DUE OUT ANY DAY NOW AND WE THINK THOSE ARE PROBABLY END UP GETTING LITIGATED TOGETHER THE THANK YOU AND THEN. JUST FINAL ON THAT. SOME OF THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WON EMBRACE THE LOWER EMISSION STANDARDS. THOSE HAVE BEEN BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE- INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS YES WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- NOBODY WANTS TO RUN A FILE OF. ANTI TRUST LAWS BUT- WE AS REGULATORS CAN WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE REGULATED. COMPANIES TO COME UP WITH- ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE PATHS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH FORD- VOLKSWAGEN HONDA AND BMW. AND I THINK THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S STILL A LOT OF SWIRL GOING ON ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE WHEN THE- EPA COMES OUT WITH THEIR FINAL ROLE BUT- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE COMPANIES. EITHER SIGNING ON TO THOSE AGREEMENTS OR VOLUNTARILY SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BETTER THAN WHAT THOSE STANDARDS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT AND I DID JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE ON THE RECORD. TO CONFIRM THAT THESE ARE THE RESULT OF BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU AT A SERIES QUESTIONS. ARE WE YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE TRUMPETED STATION SECTOR YOU TALKED ABOUT THE- NEED FOR WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION ARE WE ON TARGET TO MEET OUR GOALS BY THIRD TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE ON THE PATH BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY DON'T WE DON'T SEE THE END IN SIGHT YOU KNOW I THINK THE TRAJECTORY. IS GENERALLY CORRECT BUT IT NEEDS TO BE- BAND TO THE CURVE NEEDS TO BE BENT FURTHER TO MAKE TWENTY THIRTY. AND I FELT WORKING ON A NEW PLAN. A I MEAN SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROPOSED AS HE TALKED ABOUT THE GOAL OF. CAP AND TRADE AND- I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH BUT IT'S ON THE LIKE CAP AND TRADE THEN ISN'T GONNA HELP GET US THERE- IT'S SOME SORT OF A- MODEL OR SAMPLE YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT BUT- YOU KNOW HOW HOW ARE REALLY GOING TO REDUCE THE PETROLEUM. DEMAND THAT'S OUT THERE BOTH THE YOU KNOW FROM OUR OUR CARS BUT ALSO FROM REFINING FROM. PRODUCTION AND SO FORTH. SO OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN PRIMARILY ON- THE DEMAND. SIDE TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR. PETROLEUM TO BE- TO BE PRODUCED STORE REFINED IN CALIFORNIA. BY REDUCING THE NEED FOR PEOPLE TO BUY THIS STUFF. BY A- INSISTING THAT THE CARS BE MORE EFFICIENT AND THAT THEY WERE PRODUCED LESS GREENHOUSE GASES. AND RAPIDLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT ARE OUT THERE- THERE ARE. AS YOU KNOW- WAYS IN WHICH YOU COULD SIMPLY. BAY AND PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM OR AT LEAST DRIVE IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT UP UNTIL NOW THE POLICY HAS BEEN TO SAY. AS LONG AS WE'RE STILL BUYING THIS STUFF. IT WOULD BE PUTTING US AT AN ECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE WERE TO REQUIRE THAT EVERYBODY WHO NEEDED TO PUT GAS IN THEIR CAR HAD TO BUY GAS THAT WAS IMPORTED. FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE SO. THERE'S A YOU KNOW WE AE WE'RE PART OF A LARGER. MARKET HERE FOR- FOR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. BUT AS WE LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE TOWARDS A REALLY ZERO EMISSION FUTURE. THEN WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE ROLE OF- PETROLEUM VERSUS ALTERNATIVE FEELS IS GONNA BE. AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH FUEL FOR THE KIND OF CARS THAT WE WANT TO SEE DRIVEN AND I. I SAY CARS BUT REALLY IT'S EVERYTHING IT'S THE TRUCKS- AND IF THE BUSES AND- ALL THE OTHER OUT. OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT WERE OPERATING AS- BUT IF WE NEED TO HAVE A PER. YOU SALES OF. MAY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE BE ELECT. AND WERE NOT ANTI TO MEET THOSE GOALS ARE SHOULD WE NOT BE TALKED ABOUT HOW LEAVE REDUCE EMISSIONS ARE PETROLEUM DEMAND IN OTHER WAYS INCLUDING MAYBE RACING THE FLOOR. OF CAP AND TRADE ALLOWANCES. I DON'T THAT WOULD BE A SORT OF AN INDIRECT WAY OF GETTING ABIT- THERE ARE OTHER WAYS I THINK THAT WE CAN SEE THE MARKET WHICH REALLY IS GROWING ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS ALREADY- IMPROVE QUITE RAPIDLY I DON'T MEAN TO PLACE TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON ADS AT THE SUPERBOWL BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT- EVEN GENERAL MOTORS WHICH IS ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT% SUING US OVER OUR AUTHORITY CHOSE TO USE THEIR- HOWEVER MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT COSTS THEM FOR THEIR YOU KNOW FEW SECONDS IN THE GAME TO ADVERTISE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE ELECTRIC CALMER MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THEY- THAT'S WHERE THEY THINK THEIR FUTURE IS BUT WHATEVER IT WAS. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE INDICATES TO ME THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF- YOU KNOW DESIRE ON THEIR PART BUT THEY THINK THAT'S WHERE THE MARKET IS GOING ALREADY SO IT'S MORE A QUESTION I THINK OF WHAT WEEK AS A STATE OF THAT HAS HIGHWAYS UNDER OUR JURISDICTION THAT THAT DOES TAXES THAT DOES A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE- I MEAN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADD SOME CITIES ARE ALREADY LOOKING AT A LOS ANGELES I KNOW IS LOOKING AT TO CREATING ZONES- BY THE TIME OF THE OLYMPICS COMING TO LA. ARE YOU COULDN'T GO INTO THAT AREA WITHOUT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO THERE ARE THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO COMPARE THEM WITH EACH OTHER- AND SEE WHICH OF THEM GET A STATE WE NEED TO GET OUT AS COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. WE JUST. WITH A- LEO RIVER THAT HAVE COME OUT ABOUT OUR- OUR PARK AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOOD TO MEET OUR- THIRD GOAL. AND WE HAD THE TRANSPORTATION ONE THAT'S COME OUT WE'VE HAD THE ENERGY SECTOR HAS COME OUT WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER REPORTS THEM BY. INDIVIDUAL GROUPS ARE SEPARATE FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY'RE ALL POINTING TO THE FACT THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE MEETING. ARE TWENTY THIRTY HOLES RIGHT AND SO WHILE THE MARKET MIGHT BE SHIFTING AS A SHIFTING QUICKLY ENOUGH AND IS NOT OUR JOB AS WE TALK ABOUT CAP AND TRADE OR CARPET TAX OR ANYTHING ELSE TO HELP ME TO THE MARKET GETS THERE BY THE TIME WE NEED IT. WE SET A GOAL OF TWENTY THIRTY AND GET AND THAT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE END OF THE CENTURY IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THAT GOAL EVEN. WITH THAT TOO FAR AWAY DO WE NEED MORE IMMEDIATE. ME IMMEDIATE ACTION NOW AND SO YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT WE NEED TO REVISIT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF CAP AND TRADE IS. A LONG WAY IN IT JUST TO CAN. THE COSTS BRENDA. I SHOULD WE BE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL COSTS ARE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR ECONOMY WE DON'T ACT QUICKLY ENOUGH AND I THINK FOR MYSELF THIS IS SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS ADVANTAGE COMMUNITIES COMMITTEES THAT ARE THE MOST BIRD AND WHERE HEALTH IS AT RISK- EVEN MORE EVERY DAY THAT SENSE OF URGENCY THAT WE THAT WE HAVE THERE. ON INTO YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT. THE GOAL OF CAPTAIN TRADING STATED A GOAL OR TO THEM TO THAT CONTINUE TO BE OUR GOAL OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO BE THIS THAT. I THINK IT'S A- THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SCOPE A PLAN THAT WILL TAKE US TO TWENTY THIRTY. THAT IS A STATE WHERE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE- MISSION OF EVERYONE OF THE- MEASURES THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE PLAN IS AND THAT INCLUDES CAP AND TRADE. AS I SAID WHEN WE DID THE ORIGINAL. SCOPING PLAN GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. WE SAW CAP AND TRADE AS BEING. A WAY TO PUT A CAP. WHICH WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE TO SAY. HOW MANY TOTAL EMISSIONS ARE ALLOWABLE. AND THEN TO CREATE A CREDIBLE SYSTEM. WHICH INCLUDED A RECOGNITION OF THE FACT. THAT OUR OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAMS WERE GOING TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE EMISSIONS. SO IT WOULD BE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THOSE WHO HAD TO. HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAM. IT IS IN A SENSE IT'S IN THIS WAS SO CLEARLY DISCUSSED WHEN THAT. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THIRTY TWO YOU COULD LOOK AT CAP AND TRADE AS BEING A TYPE OF CARBON TAX IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING IT WHERE. YOU KNOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALLOW AND SAYS AND THE PRICE CAN VERY UNDER. UNDER A CARBON TAX YOU SAT AT AMOUNT OF PRICE- H. THàNH OF CARBON AND- THEN PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE HOW MUCH OF IT THEY WANT TO USE. OR NOT. USE AND EITHER ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF SYSTEMS HAS PRINT SEVERAL CONSEQUENCES TO IT. THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IS MORE. INDIRECT PEOPLE DON'T SEE- AND- THAT SOMETIMES THAT'S FRUSTRATING TO THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE SUBJECT TO THESE PROGRAMS. BUT THE FACT IS THAT IT'S A THIS IS A POLICY. CHOICE THAT THAT NEED TO BE MADE AND I THINK IT'S A I THINK IT REALLY IS A CHOICE OF THE- LATER ITSELF NEEDS TO. NEEDS TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN. A I AGREE THAT WE AS LIST JOURNEY TO BE THIS TEAM WERE WERE AT WITH. WITH CAPTAIN AND IF GIVEN THE NEW INFORMATION WE HAVE AND THAT IS WHERE WE- CONTINUE ARE NOT I ALWAYS SAW IT AS- A WAY TO CLOSE THE DELTA- AND LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT REPORTS THE YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT OUR PS. IS I'VE HAD A POSITIVE. EFFECT ON OUR GOALS TOWARDS OUR WILLS ARE. WE THERE'S A FEW A FEW ITEMS OUT THERE THAT WE KNOW ARE YOU ARE YOU LEADING US IN A GOOD DIRECTION BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THT ARE NOT. ON AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT- CAP AND TRADE AND IF WE NEED TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE- IN. POSSIBLY CHANGE. ARE THOSE THE PRICING THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS CHANGING BEHAVIOR AS WELL. WELL IT AND GET IT I THINK YOU. MENTIONED THE FACT THAT- WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED IT WAS NOT INTENDED AS A REVENUE RAISER I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE. THAT POINT. OF THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A SMALL NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT THE STATE DIDN'T JUST. VOLUNTARILY GIVE TO THE SUBJECT TO THE PARTY SUBJECT TO IT. WAS A THAT WAS CONTROVERSY- BUT WE SAID. WE NEED SOMETHING IN ORDER TO. BASICALLY BE AND MAKE SURE THERE'S TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE PRICE THAT PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRICE IS. AND AS IT TURNED OUT IT RAISED A- SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE WHICH IS THAT WE USE- IT FOR VERY GOOD PURPOSES AND- I MEAN I THINK YEAH IT'S BEEN A- REALLY THAT HAS BEEN A BRILLIANT SUCCESS. BUT THE PROGRAM WAS NOT DESIGNED WITH I WAS ALMOST AN AFTERTHOUGHT. YEAH NOW AFTER THE THAN I HAD BECOME AND- THAT. PROGRAM OUT THERE RIGHT SO DEFINITELY- LET ME ASK YOU A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DIRECTION- BUT BUT TIED TO THE SAME DISCUSSION WHEN WE DID CAP AND TRADE WITH THAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND YOUR WEAPONS THAT IN IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOUR EARLIER PART OF YOUR- PRESENTATION- AND THE GOAL OF. OF THE OF CARDS YOU KNOW TO HAVE CLEANER AIR OUT THERE IS ALL THE OTHER PARTICULAR MATTERS HE SHOWED US IN THE FIRST HALF OF YOUR PRESENTATION BUT IN THE BUDGET- THAT WAS JUST PRESENTED IN JANUARY BY THE GOVERNOR. THE COP TO AB SEVENTEEN OUT THERE AND THE DISTRICT IMPLEMENTATION FUNDING- OTHERS TO CUT TO THE INCENTIVES FOR CLEAN CARS AND TRUCKS AND SO IT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF. COUNTRY TO SOME OF OUR- AS WE LOOK AT THE PICTURE HOMELESS. THE HAVE. INPUT ON THAT OR- COMMENTS. I REALLY COULD ONLY COMMENT THAT I THINK THE BUDGET- REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF A CONVERSATION WHICH I KNOW YOU WILL BE HAVING OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. YEAH I MEAN. DEFINITELY AS LIZ WE'VE WE'VE JUST OF FINISH THE FIRST YOUR PLANS AND WE HAVE SELECTED THAT MAKES A HANDFUL OF COMMUNITIES- IT IS A LITTLE TROUBLING BUT WHEN WE THINK OF THE GOVERNOR SCHOOL OF JUSTICE FOR ALL- WELL A. B. C.'S SEVENTEEN IS AND- BY ALL MEANS ARE ONLY. TOOL THAT WE NEED IT IS ONE THAT IS ACTUALLY DRAWING DOWN TO LOCAL LEVEL FOR MAKING SURE HAT WE HAVE JUSTICE FOR ALL. THAT'S SPECIFIC TO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY SAYS WE'RE LOOKING HOLISTICALLY AT THE SYSTEM WE'RE MAKING SURE THAT THOSE SAME EMISSION TRANSIT WE SORRY ON THAT WE SHOULD BE REALLY PROUD OF HIS OF THE STATE. CAN BE FELT BY ALL CALIFORNIANS AND NOT JUST SOME CALIFORNIANS. OUT THERE. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT I- FOR THE SAKE OF. A SICK INTO MY OWN TIMELINE. GOING TO GOING TO THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION TO THE LOCAL OVER TO THE CONTINUED DISCUSSION TO THE BUDGET TO DO ADDITIONAL HEARINGS. AND I DIDN'T GET TO ASK YOU ABOUT OUR TOPICS RELATED TO THE SECOND PART OF THE PRESENTATION I DO APOLOGIZE I SAY JUST REALIZED- I LOST TRACK OF MY HEALTHCARE- I WAS SO BUSY WITH CAP AND TRADE IN AB SIX SEVENTEEN. SO ACTUALLY. IN THE SECOND HALF WE'RE GOING TO BE THIS GUY ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND I DIDN'T GET TO ASK ANY OF YOUR OPINIONS YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO SAY ANYTHING WELL WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES HERE AS I MENTIONED WE DID DEVELOP AN ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL FOR- CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS AND WE'RE AWARE NOW THAT DOWN THERE'S A MOVEMENT TOWARDS BRINGING FORWARD AT LEAST ONE PROJECT THAT. WOULD HOPE TO GO THROUGH THAT KIND OF A NEW SYSTEM AND WE THINK THAT WILL BE A BIG INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO DO IT- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON THAT SAID- BEING FUNDED BY FOUNDATIONS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WE DON'T HAVE A BUDGET RELATE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AREA THERE BUT WE'RE VERY KEEN ON- I'M FOLLOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IF WE CAN FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN- FURTHER. INDUCE MORE PEOPLE TO- TO BRING FORWARD AND EXPAND ON THESE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO WE WILL BE TRACKING- GHG REDUCTION SEPARATELY FROM GHG NEGATIVE EMISSIONS OF WE WILL HAVE THAT YES. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING IS. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. FIRST IN THE. OKAY I THINK IS THAT WE HAVE OUR SECOND PANEL. COMING UP WHERE WE HAVE IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS OUT INTO THAT COULD HAVE THOSE PANELISTS COME UP HERE PLEASE. AND SO TO THEY WERE HAVE GEORGE PERIOD AS OFTEN THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB. TALKING TO US ABOUT THE IMPACT OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS ARE REACHING OUR STATE CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. LAKE SIMON'S WITH THE DIVISION- DIRECTOR FOR BIOSCIENCES AT LAWRENCE. BERKELEY NATIONAL LAB THAT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THAT TO GIVE EMISSIONS OF CARBON. REMOVAL AND OTHER BIO BASED STRATEGIES. AND LUCILLE THAT'S WHERE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNSEL WITH THE ROLE OF EQUITY IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING TIME TO BE HERE TODAY TO THE A PRESENTATIONS AND HELP ANSWER SOME OF OUR COMMITTEES QUESTIONS. AND SO WE WILL LET YOU BEGAN- AND SO WILL HAVE GEORGE READ AS GO AHEAD TO START. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE TIMELY INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS GEORGE BURIED US. AND I'M DELIGHTED TO REPRESENT THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THE TOPIC OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS INTENTLY. ON THE LAST WEEK WE RELEASED A COMPREHENSIVE FIRST OF ITS KIND REPORT THAT OUTLINES. REALISTIC PATHWAYS THAT ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE ITS MID CENTURY CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL. WE FOUND THAT BY REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE F. THE STATE CAN ACHIEVE ITS GOAL AT A COST THAT IS LESS THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY SPENDS TO MANAGE TRASH. TODAY HUMM EAGER TO SHED SOME OF A OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED THE REPORT WAS CO AUTHORED BY APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SCIENTISTS ACROSS A TO RENOWNED CITIZENS. AND ORGANIZATIONS AND MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE GENEROSITY OF THE CLIMATE WORKS FOUNDATION. CALIFORNIA HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF AS AN INDISPUTABLE LEADER IN CLIMATE CHANGE TECHNOLOGIES AND POLICIES GLOBALLY. AND LATELY IS HAS STEPPED UP ITS AMBITION LEVEL CONSIDERABLY THROUGH GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THE CALLS FOR REDUCING EMISSIONS TWO ZERO. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE AIR IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN BE CERTAIN TO ACHIEVE THIS FILE GOAL. DOING SO IS NEITHER A LICENSED TO CONTINUE POLLUTING. NOR LUXURY THAT WE CAN DO AWAY WITH. THE PRECIPICE UNFORTUNATELY REALLY IS BEFORE US. AND WE HAVE TO TAKE CAPITOL STEPS TO REDUCE AND MANAGE OUR RISK OF FAILURE. WHEN I WAS A TAKING AVALANCHE TRAINING I WAS STRUCK BY SOMETHING THAT'S THE NOLLIE. MOUNTAINEERING RANGER DAVE WEBER SAID. HE SAID THAT ALL HOPE IS A HORRIBLE RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL. AND THE WHEN WE WERE LONG ON HOPE TO KEEP US SAFE. WE ARE PROBABLY IN HARM'S WAY. I AM PROUD TO LIVE IN A STATE THAT ENABLES ME TO HAVE SOLAR PANELS ON MY ROOF AND TO DRIVE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE. BUT SINCE WE CANNOT CONFIDENTLY TELL OUR CHILDREN TODAY THAT OUR EFFORTS TO USE ENERGY MORE EFFICIENTLY GENERATE POWER FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES. AND PUT CLEAN IT BECAUSE ON THE ROAD ALONE. WILL REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS TWO ZERO BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WE SIMPLY CANNOT OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT CAR STRATEGIES WILL SUFFICE. WE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THAT THE EQUATION FOR REACHING THAT ZERO MAKE CHANGE AND REQUIRE AN EVEN BIGGER EFFORT. IT IS CLEAR THAT'S TO SOLIDIFY CHANCES OF ACHIEVING THEGOAL WE MUST THAT IN YOU STRATEGIES TO THE MIX. THE PHYSICALLY REMOVE CO TWO FROM THE AT. AND REPORTS WE SET OURSELVES A CHALLENGE OF SEEING IF CALIFORNIA CAN ACHIEVE A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. MILLION TONS PER YEAR. OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. USING ONLY TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE RIGHT TO BE SCALED UP TODAY. THIS NUMBER REPRESENTS THE LEVEL OF RIGID RESIDUAL EMISSIONS THAT WE REALISTICALLY EXPECT TO REMAIN BY MID CENTURY. DESPITE ALL OTHER MITIGATION EFFORTS. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT IN GETTING TO NEUTRAL OPTIONS FOR NEGATIVE EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WE FIND SAID THAT THE STATE'S CAN DO THAT'S USING THREE MAIN APPROACHES. HARNESSING THE POWER OF MOTHER NATURE. PUTTING WASTE BIOMASS TO WORK AND PHYSICALLY SCRUBBING CO TWO FROM THE AIR. OUR FIRST APPROACH ENTAILS STORING MORE COMMON FORESTS WETLANDS GRASSLANDS AND SOILS. THROUGH RESTORATION CHANGES TO THE WAY THE CALIFORNIA MANAGES ITS NATURAL WORKING LANDS WE COULD STORE AN ESTIMATED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TONS OF CO TWO PER YEAR WHILE BENEFITING OUR ADD WATER AND THE RESILIENCE OF THE SYSTEMS TO CHANGES IN OUR CONDITIONS. UNFORTUNATELY NATURE CAN ONLY DELIVER UP TO A FIFTH OF THIS TARGET. THE SECOND LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AND TELLS PUTTING CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIAL WASTE BY MASS RESOURCES TO WORK CONVERTING THEM INTO RING YOU WILL TRANSPORTATION FUELS WHILE APPARENTLY REMOVING AND STORING THE CARBON. THE BIOGENIC PORTION OF URBAN TRASH RESIDUES FROM AGRICULTURE AND FORCE THINGS. THAT THE STATE WILL BE REMOVING FOR FIRE RISK REDUCTION CAN BE CONFERRED CONVERTED INTO COMMON NEGATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUELS. THESE ALSO IMPROVE OUR QUALITY BOTH BY DOING AWAY WITH THE CAR IN PRACTICE OF BURNING WOOD. AND ALSO BY DISPLACING FOSSIL FUELS FROM THE WROTE. A REPORT FINDS OF THE STRATEGY COULD COULD DELIVER BETWEEN EIGHTY AND NINETY MILLION TONS OF CO TWO PER YEAR. OF NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. FINALLY THE THIRD APPROACH AND FALSE USING MACHINES A SCRUB CO TWO FROM THE AD IN A PROCESS CALLED DIRECT TAKE CAPTURE. THIS CAN BE APPLIED AND WHETHER WE HAVE GEOTHERMAL HEAT ON NATURAL GAS. AND WE CAROLINE THE STRATEGY TO MAKE AS LARGE. A CONTRIBUTION TO OUR GOAL AS WE CHOOSE. NONE OF THESE STRATEGIES RELYING ON TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS MOST OF THEM ARE READILY AVAILABLE. AND OTHERS WILL NEEDS HELP. SIMPLY TO REDUCE COSTS. THIS MAY SURPRISE YOU THE NUMBERS WHERE A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO US THIS COMBINATION OF APPROACHES IS EASILY AFFORDABLE AND COSTS RANGE BETWEEN A FEW DOLLARS PER TONNE OF CO TWO. AND LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TONNE OF CO TWO FOR DIRECT I CAPTURE AFTER A MODEST AMOUNT. OF LEARNING. THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE IS LESS THAN TEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. LESS THAN WHAT CALIFORNIA SPENDS ON MANAGING ITS TRASH AND ONLY ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENTS OF THE STATE'S CURRENT GDP. YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CARBON THAT WE REMOVE- THAT ISN'T STORED IN NATURAL SYSTEMS SYSTEMS WHAT IS I GO. WELL IT'S GOES RIGHT BACK WHERE IT CAME FROM IT CAN BE STORED IN THE SAID IMMENSELY ROCKS THAT HAVE HELD WATER GAS AND OIL FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. AND WELL WE DUG UP THE CARBON IN THE FIRST PLACE. CALIFORNIA'S TRULY BLESSED WITH EXCEPTIONAL GEOLOGY. AND BASINS THAT CAN STORE LIQUID CO TWO SAFELY AND PERMANENTLY. AND WE ALSO HAVE THE WORLD'S NEWEST INSTRUCTORS REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN CO TWO INJECTION. THANKS TO THE VISION RE EFFORTS AND THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD UNDER CHEN NICHOLS COMPLETED JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE MITIGATION THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH OR TOO FAST. WE NEED ALL SAFE APPROACHES ON THE TABLE. THE URGENCY IN MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM SIMPLY DO NOT AFFORD US ANY WIGGLE ROOM THE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS PATHWAYS THAT WE HAD DONE TO FIND IN A IN THE REPORTS. A WELL WITHIN THE STATE'S REACH AND ARE AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTS TO THE MITIGATION TOOLS A CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY CHAMPIONS. WHAT'S MORE THESE APPROACHES WILL CREATE JOBS IN THE STATE WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED. THEY WERE DISPLACED ALSO FUELS IT WOULD HELP CLEAN UP AND WATER AND THAT WOULD PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY THROUGH WILDFIRE PREVENTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS REACHED ITS NIKE MOMENTS AND CLIMB IN MITIGATION IT IS TIME TO JUST DO IT. AND SIGNED A TEAM STAND TO HELP- STAND READY TO HELP IN ANY WAY THAT WE CAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL BE THE NEXT PRESENTATION I'LL ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END OF ALL. THANK. HI MY NAME'S BLAKE SIMMONS- DIVISION DIRECTOR OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND ENGINEERING AT LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY. GET THE SLIDES UP AND- BY MINUTES. I WILL GIVE YOU A BRO WHEN HIGH LEVEL TOUR OF A VARIETY OF PROJECTS THAT. DON'T FEEL VERY NICELY WITH THE- THE REST OF THE PRESENTATION THAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. AND SO- WITH A FOCUS ON THOSE THAT REALLY ENABLE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND ALSO HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS. AND JUST PUT IT IN CONTEXT ABOUT THIS NOTION OF A CIRCULAR ECONOMY- THIS IS A WASTE NOT WANT NOT- TYPE OF APPROACH FOR CARBON MANAGEMENT AND FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. WHERE YOU BASICALLY HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT IS BASED ON MULTIPLE PASSES OF THE SAME CARBON. THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS THAT YOU SEE HERE OF OUTLINED HERE. ON THAT CHART ON THE RIGHT- THE BIO CONNIE IS A PART OF THAT AND THE BIO COM UNITED STATES IS ROUGHLY ONE TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR NOW. SO IT'S NOT A- INSIGNIFICANT THING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NOTHING ON THE FRINGES IT IS VERY. MAINSTREAM AND CALIFORNIA'S AT THE FOREFRONT OBVIOUSLY OF LEADING THE WAY TO THE TO PAINT THE WAY FOR. A CIRCULAR CONNIE AND- GERMAN NICHOLS POINTED OUT THESE- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BE OPERATING ON THE CIRCUIT. I MEAN WHERE YOU BASS HE REVIEWS RE UTILIZE AND RICK. THE CALIFORNIA CAR RESOURCES ARE DISTRIBUTED- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE UNIQUE GEOGRAPHIC AND NATURAL RESOURCES THAT ARE STRATEGIC TO VOTE THE ECONOMY INTO THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE STATE. OTHERS ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE MILLION BONE DRY TIMES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CONVERT INTO SOMETHING. EACH YEAR. AND THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT. YOU KNOW CAN WE MAKE NOT LOOKING FOR A SILVER BULLET. BUT REALLY LOOKING AT A PRIORITIZE WAY TO MANAGE THAT RESOURCE APPROPRIATELY EFFECTIVELY. SECOND HAVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT TO THE ECONOMY THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH. BY MANUFACTURING THIS IS THE VERY SIMPLE CARTOON OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. IS YOU HAVE MULTIPLE INPUTS THAT ARE COMING INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN REPLACE MANUFACTURING THAT WE KNOW TODAY IN A CONVENTIONAL SENSE. AND THESE COULD BE SUGARS THAT ARE LIBERATED FROM THE MISSILE AS A BIOMASS TREES GRASSES WHAT HAVE YOU- THEY CAN BE LINK THEN FROM THOSE SAME RESOURCES AND THEY CAN ALSO BE WASTE STREAMS BE THEY FROM FORESTRY FROM AGRICULTURE INCLUDING MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE. AND THE POINT IS THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE ALL THESE CARBON INPUTS AND PUT THEM INTO AN APPROACH RE CAN GENERATE MULTIPLE OUTPUT GET OFF OF EVERY ASPECT PETROLEUM. WHY THE JOB FOR CHEMICAL COMPANY OR FUELS AND DO SO IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY THAT MAXIMIZES THE IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT THE HEALTH AND THE ECONOMY. ONE EIGHT. OF THAT IS TRANSITIONING OR WAY FROM GREEN GAS SOURCE THE SINK IN THIS WAS ALLUDED TO IN THE EARLIER TALK. ABOUT THE MANAGE AN ACTIVE LANDS THAT THE PRACTICES AND LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT CAN ACTUALLY GENERATE A CARBON SINK OUT INTO THESE MANAGE LANDS. AS A WE CAN INCREASE THE QUANTITY OF BOMB MASSIVE REQUIRES THIS MANAGEMENT CONVERSION WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN TERM NICHOLS TALK. BUT ALSO INCREASE THE GENERATION OF BY PRODUCTS SUCH AS DIGEST STATES COMPOST AND BY WHICH ARE. THEY CAN BE USED WITH THE VANCE PLAN MATTER PRACTICES THE DRIVE THAT CAR. FORWARD THE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT AND TRANSFORM WHAT IS CURRENTLY A POLLUTANT SOURCE OF CALL IN AND TURN IT INTO A SINK THAT CAN BE USED TO ENABLE. THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS. THE ROLE OF BIO TURNED JUST SAY THE NET ECONOMY IS HERE AND THE NUMBERS ARE. ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BUT WE COULD OVER TIME BASICALLY ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS MEDIC A EMISSIONS. A IF YOU TAKE IT OVER SEVERAL DECADES AND SO THIS IS A VERY. INTERESTING APPROACH THAT IS CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN VERY SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT. AND DOVETAILS NICELY WITH THE POLICY REQUIREMENTS OF YOU WERE EVEN TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S ALSO THE NOTION INITIAL SOLID WASTE AS A BIOLOGY FEEDSTOCK IN SO IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS IN PARTICULAR- THERE IS A LOT OF WAYS THAT IS GENERATED THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING. BALLERUP ISN'T ANYTHING USEFUL FOR. ME TO BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH. AND SO THERE'S A PROJECT THE THAT WAS A JOINT ONE BETWEEN I DON'T NATIONAL LABORATORY SANDIA NORTH BERKELEY. WHERE WE DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES TO DO BLENDING OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE STREAMS AND CONVERT THEM INTO BILE FEELS ABOUT PRODUCTS. THAT COULD GO INTO THE ECONOMY AND BE OF NET BENEFIT. TO BOTH IN. AND HUMAN HEALTH. AS WHEN HE TAKE A LOOK AT THE FOOD. AND PAY WAY. I CAN VAL RISE THOSE ARE. LEASE IN FILE FEELS ABOUT PRODUCTS AND WON'T. GET INTO LIKE THE NEED TO BE HERE ON THE DETAILS WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. BUT THESE ARE CURRENT TECH. THAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF THE SHOW TERM. THANK YOU BEEN. BOTH RULE URBAN. ENEMY JOBS. WITHIN MOMENT IN. THEN WE'LL THE. INSTITUTE AND A MESS OF BIOFUELS COMPANY AND IT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON CONVERTING WOODY BIOMASS FEEDSTOCKS THEIR WASTE STREAMS CURRENTLY OR POSE A RISK TO THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH WILD FIRES. AND DEPLOY A TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DEVELOPED AT THE NATIONAL LABS IN UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TRANSFORM THOSE WOULD BE BOMBERS RESOURCES IN THIS CASE AS ALMOND WALLET BEHIND IN POPLAR. INTO AN AVIATION BIOFUEL PRECURSOR- AND SO THAT IT IS A GREAT PROJECT OF BREAK PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND ALSO A STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP. BECAUSE OF THE FUNDING FOR THE JOINT BIO IMAGES TO COME FROM THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND THIS SEIZE THE FINDINGS ACOSTA SHARE FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT COMMERCIALIZED. TECHNOLOGY OUT OF THAT THE AMERICAN BUT IT. END OF ONE VERY EXCITING. THE JUST GOT A NOW I TODAY A CAL IN THIS IS FUNDED BY THE C. C. I G. G. R. F. FUND. IT'S A DEVELOPMENT OF A MOBILE BUYER REFINERY THAT HE COULD TAKE OUT TO ASSIST WITH FIRE CLEARING OPERATIONS I SHOULD SAY FIRED. UP FOR STREET FITTING OPERATIONS WHERE YOU COULD TAKE THE THING MATERIAL AND THE RESIDUES THAT GETS GENERATED THAT ARE CLEARED OUT OF THE FOREST TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES. AND HAVING THIS MOBILE PLATFORM THAT CAN HURT THEM INTO BILE POWER BIO FUELS AND BIO CHART. AND THIS COULD MINIMIZE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION BY ABOUT 90% IT'S SIGNIFICANT SNIFFING THE IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY BY ELIMINATING PARTICULATE EMISSIONS AND CAN BE LOCAL ECONOMIES BY DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED OUT THERE. AND WITH A DIRECT LOCAL IF IN SO THIS IS THE- IS PILOT TERM UP. BOTH THE DAY THAT THE TECH FEASIBLE BUT YOU CAN ENVISION A SCENARIO WHERE DOZENS OF UNITS FOR. WHY. TONS OF THE BOMB AS THAT CURRENTLY IS A WELFARE RISK AND CONVERTED INTO. THAT CAN BENEFIT ECONOMY AND- HUMAN HEALTH. THERE'S AN ODD JOB OUR FOUNDRY WHICH ON REFLECTION PROGRAMS AND MULTI LAB PARTNERSHIPS AROUND A BY MANUFACTURING TO BOLSTER THE ECONOMY THAT IS ALSO DIRECTLY OF FUNDED TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS. CERTAINLY THERE'S IS ADVANCED BY APPEALS ON FILE PARKS PROCESS DEMONSTRATION IN WHICH IS ONE OF THESE CATALYSTS THE ENTERPRISES TO TAKE THAT FIRST STEP BETWEEN THE LAB INTO THE ECONOMY. AND AS PROOF POSITIVE THAT THIS IS LOCATED A BERKELEY LAB AND IT'S WORKED WITH FORTY INDUSTRY COLLABORATORS- MOST OF THEM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ITS DIRECTLY RESULTED IN THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH OF NINE PRODUCTS THAT YOU CAN BUY AT TARGET WALMART TODAY. AS A THIS IS A ROOM LISTENING TEMPLE OF A PUBLIC FOR PARTNERSHIP THAT BOOSTS THE ME BY DOING DIRECT. WITH INDUSTRY IN THE RISKY RISK INVESTMENT FOUND SCALING UP A PRODUCT IN EXPELLING INTO DIRECT MARKETING. BY THIS IN A FIELD WITH IS IN CAN. FOOD HEALTH AND MEET WITH ME AND I CAL DERRY. AND ALSO THE ENVIRONMENT IN OUR CULTURE IN TERMS OF SOIL THEM IS THAT WE CAN USE. FOR GROWTH IN THE AXE- ENFORCEMENT. BUT THAT. I WILL THEY THANK YOU A I'M SHORT ON TIME IT'LL TURN OVER TO THE NEW BAKER. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD ACTORS. HI MY NAME'S LOUISE BUT IT'S WORTH A I'M NEEDS. DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL- THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL THE COUNCIL COORDINATES AND WORST COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH PUBLIC AGENCIES COMMUNITIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ACHIEVE HEALTHY THRIVING AND EQUITABLE EQUITABLE AND RESILIENT COMMUNITIES FOR ALL. AND SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING ACROSS ALL OF OUR AGENCIES TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PUBLIC HEALTH- AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS ARE COUNCIL IS TEN MEMBERS- INCLUDING SEVEN CABINET SECRETARIES AND CHAIRED BY KATE CORD AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH WE DO OUR WORK. A NUMBER OF WAYS THROUGH- INTEGRATED POLICY PROGRAMS- TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING BUT THEN ALSO THROUGH A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- INSERT TODAY. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE EXAMPLES HOW WE'RE PUTTING INTO PRACTICE A FEW OF THE PRINCIPLE THE PROOF IS. TALKED. I MEAN I KNOW MEET OUR GOAL THE CLIENT GOALS. NEGATIVE MISSION AND THIS REGION CAPTURE ARE GOING TO BE CRITICS. AND AS A MINISTRATION WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING- AS CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT AND NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS TO STORE CARBON TO AVOID THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAN THE CONVERSION OF OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS. STC ADMINISTERS THE SUSTAINABLE ATLANTA CONSERVATION PROGRAM USING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND DOLLARS. AND HAS PRESERVED OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND ACRES OF FARM AND RANGE LANDS- OVER THE FIRST FEW ROUNDS OF THIS PROGRAM. AND SO THIS WORK IS HAPPENING AND ALL DIFFERENT SCALES FROM THE VERY LARGE- FROM FOREST SCALE RANCH SCALE DOWN TO A NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY AND PROJECTS SCALE SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT SMALLER SCALE WORK WHICH I THINK REALLY HELPS TO IN BED. AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROMOTE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS ALONG SIDE COMMUNITIES STAKEHOLDERS AND PEOPLE AND I THINK YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE IDEA AS ACTUALLY START TO BE PUT INTO PRACTICE SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY PROJECT SO WANTED TO START WITH ONE. OF OUR TO. CLIMATE IS. TRANSFORM TIMING IN THESE PER AMP THROUGH THE GREAT. PRODUCTION FUND MAKES LARGE INVESTMENTS AT A NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE ON THE ORDER OF FIVE GRAMS PER SQUARE MILE OR LESS INTENT TO MAKE IT IT'S A TRICK. THAT'S MEANT TO CATTLE. ENGINE MOST ANISH THREE. POINT IT'S BY A COMMUNITY RATED THEN AT SOME IS KEEP CO RATE AND OKAY SO THE NIKKEI MAY. THINKING WORKS TO. FORTY BASEMENT AS IN THIS. CLUED ORBIT URBAN FORESTRY URBAN FARMING NEW PARK PROJECTS TREE PLANTING SOIL BUILDING COMPOSTING ALL FOCUSED ON A LOT OF NEIGHBORHOODS SCALE BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BUT ALSO THEN STORING CARBON- AND DOING A NUMBER OF OTHER BENEFITS. SO I JUST PROVIDE IF YOU VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING. SO I ONE OF OUR FIRST INVESTMENTS IS IN ONTARIO CALIFORNIA AB. AND WE'VE INVESTED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AN INTEGRATED SET OF PROJECTS IN ONE OF THESE OBJECTS IS THAT WHERE TAKE OF I A COMMUNITY GARDEN. I WHICH IS CREATING A NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE ON TERRIO CARBON FARM. THIS IS A CLOSED LOOP ORGANIC PROJECT THAT'S TURNING NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL FOOD WASTE INTO SOIL COMPOST. THE COMPOST IS THEN BEING FED BACK INTO THE PROJECT AREA- FOR COMMUNITY AND HOUSEHOLD GARDENS FARMS AND IRVING GREENING AND HAVE A HOUSING PROJECT THAT IS FUNDED THROUGH THIS PROJECT. IS USING THE COMPOST IT WILL BE. OUT DIRECTLY FOR THEIR LANDSCAPING USES- THIS PROJECT THE RID RID ABOUT TWENTY FIVE A TWENTY FIVE HAD MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO. OVER THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE PROJECT BUT YOU SEE CENSUS ABOUT TEN FOR OF THE AMERICAN RED. THROUGH THAT LAW SCALE. INVEST IN THE READ. I SIMILAR AND FRESNO WE'VE GOT OTHER LARGE TO. INVEST AT I FRESNO MINISTRY IS BUILDING A CAR AND FAR THAT WILL PROMOTE TECHNI SUCH AS TO. NOW MCKAY AND NOSE SPRAY GROW METHOD TO PROMOTE. STORAGE IN SEQUESTRATION WATER CONSERVATION AND OF COURSE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S LABOR COMMUNITY ACTION COMMITTEE IS COLLECTING FOOD WASTE AND OTHER- AND WILL REDISTRIBUTE COMPOST TO RESIDENTS OR DIVERT IT TO LOCAL FARMS- AND SO ALL OF THIS AGAIN TAKING WASTE FROM THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPING A SYSTEM TO GET IT BACK OUT AND USE IN THE COMMUNITY SO TRYING TO CREATE A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM. IN ADDITION IN WHAT'S WERE PLANNING OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STREETS ON CITY STREETS- AND ESTABLISHING FIFTY MANY URBAN FARMS- ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TO HELP JUST AGAIN USED FOR THE COMPLEX BUT ALSO DISTRIBUTING THIS TYPE OF FIVE CARBON STORY OPPORTUNITY AT DIFFERENT SKIN AND SO AGAIN IN THIS IN THIS WHAT'S PROJECT WHERE WE'VE INVESTED MADE A LARGE SCALE INVESTMENT IN INTEGRATED SET OF PROJECTS. ABOUT ONE SEVENTH OF THE TOTAL CARBON REDUCTION WE'RE EXPECTING THROUGH THAT PROJECT- IS COMING FROM THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS- WE ALSO LOOK AT THIS AT A PROJECT LEVEL SCALES WHEN WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE. BEAUTIES PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS INTEGRATED HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA- AND REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE MAKING LAND USE AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS- TO BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING- TO JOB- AND OTHER DESTINATIONS ARE REALLY LOOKING WITH A FOCUS ON HOW TO. REDUCE DRIVING BUT A LONG SET DOING THAT HOW WE CONTINUE TO PROMOTE URBAN GREENING AND SO WE REQUIRE URBAN GREEN. FOR ALL PRIVATE. SCHOOLS SEE AT LEAST TO READING PROJECT A PART OF FIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROJECT. AND HAVE INCENTIVE POINTS- TO ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL WORK AND SO A FEW EXAMPLES THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE- IS IN MANCHESTER- MANCHESTER URBAN HOMES IN LA. IT'S GOING TO BE INSTALLING A GREEN ALLEY AND THE GARDEN- BLACKSTONE MCKINLEY ANOTHER PROJECT THAT IS IN FRESNO- IS DOING AB. STREET TREES THAT NOT ONLY CAPTURE CARBON BETTER PROVIDING A REALLY IMPORTANT URBAN HEAT ISLAND AND HEAT MITIGATING EFFECT- AND THEN IN THE CITY OF COACHELLA WHERE WE'VE JUST RECENTLY FUNDED A PROJECT. THERE STRATEGICALLY PLANTED TREES NEAR A NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO REDUCE UP TRICKLE OF BLOOD- AND THEN ALSO ENABLE THAT PROJECT TO RID RID TO REACHES ZERO NET ENERGY. AND THEN OF COURSE REDUCING LOCAL HER HEAT I. WELL I. IN CARBON AND I NOTE. ONLY USING OTHER IT UP. IT ALSO WRITTEN INTO. EXIT CAN START TO SEE SOME OF THESE PRACTICES BEING PUT IN ITS OF NEIGHBOR. AND PRIDE. AS IS OFF SO. REESE TO ADVANCE NEGATIVE EMISSION PRACTICES AS PART OF OUR LARGER CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM- AND I'M HAPPY I DON'T NEED TO GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL IN THE- INTEREST OF TIME. BUT ONE THING I DID WANT TO EMPHASIZE ON THIS PROGRAM IS IT'S A VERY UNIQUE RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT IS GROUNDED AND MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT AND SO WE REQUIRE EVERY FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECT- TO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP AS PART. OF THE DESIGN OF THE RESEARCH THE CONTACT AND THE ULTIMATE DISSEMINATION. OF THE RESEARCH PRODUCT THE INTENTION HERE IS TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE IN TING IN RESEARCH IT IS A THING SOLUTION PROCESSES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE USED AND PUT INTO PRACTICE AND SEE PART SHIP. IN UP BUT RE. COMMUNITY GROUP. ARM BORIS MAN IT AND SPELL CLASS YOU SHOULD THAT CAN TO SO. LIKE PART OF. MEMBERS OKAY I'LL I'LL- MR SENATE ALLEN HERE IS THAT THE ONE PROJECT YOU MENTION LOS AND JUST CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE IT IS AND KEEP GIVE A LOT MORE DETAIL ABOUT IT THE PROJECT IN WATSON IS THAT THE ONE THAT WAS NOW WE HAVE WE HAVE SEVERAL IN LA- SO THERE'S- MANCHESTER HOMES WHICH IS AT DOT NET ESTHER OKAY- AND THEN. TRANSCRIPT I'M A COMMUNITIES INVESTMENT IS- FOCUS GENERALLY AROUND THE JORDAN DOWNS HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S- CONTRIBUTING WE HAVE A COUPLE OF AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT YOU DO WITH THE WHAT CENTER OR- YES. SO THAT IS AND THAT HAS THEY ACTUALLY OF SEVERAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY GRANTS AND THEN A LARGE TCC GRANT THAT IS FUNDING- THE URBAN FARMING THAT I SPOKE ABOUT AND COMPOSTING THE STREET TREES. A LOT OF LOCAL WEATHER IS ATION- AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS. AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS AND ADDITIONAL HOUSING PROJECTS THANK YOU. THE DIRECTOR. SENATOR MINING THANK YOU **** ON YOUR WORK IN PRESENTATIONS FOR MISTER. AS SOME. YOU SPEAK WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE ABOUT THE ABILITY TO REMOVE. CARBON EMISSIONS FROM. WHAT STANDS BETWEEN US IN DOING THAT IN IS IT HAPPENING OR WHAT ARE THE STEPS TIME MAKING IT OPERATIONAL. SO AS I DIDN'T PUT UP THE COSCO BUT YOU'LL SEE THE MOST THINGS LIE IN THE SIXTY IS DOLLAR- PER TONNE OF CO TWO. PRICE TAG DIRECT TACK AT DURATEC CAPS AFTER SOME LEARNING WILL BE SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO HUNDRED WE ESTIMATE MODEST AMOUNT OF LEARNING- WHAT STANDS IN BETWEEN WELL ONE IS THE REALIZATION THAT THE STATE HAS A AN EXPLICIT DIRECTION. TO MOVE TOWARDS MISSION TO COLLEGES. I THINK COMPARING THOSE. PRICE TAGS WITH CURRENTS LCF ESCORTED PRICES YOU'LL SEE THAT MOST WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE IT DOES THAT MEAN THAT A PROJECT IS FINANCE A BOWL PERHAPSPERHAPS NOT NOTHING ONE OF THE- ISSUES SWUNG THE- RECURRING. WHEN WE TALK TO DEVELOP IS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A SECURE. SUPPLY OF BY MASS YOU CAN JUST SAY YOU I'M GONNA. GET A LITTLE BIT FROM THIS FARMER A LITTLE BIT FROM THE FROM CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO PROVE THAT YOU HAVE A STEADY SUPPLY OVER THE LIFE OF. AND THE FINAL THING THAT WOULD SAY IS COORDINATION AND PERMITTING. YOU BRING TOGETHER. FAMILIES OF ACTIVITIES THAT'S- COME UNDER EXISTING AUTHORITIES IN JURISDICTIONS BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN ATTEMPTED. TO BE BONDED TOGETHER AS A AS A UNIQUE CHAIN SO YOU NEED TO. PERMITS WOULD ADD DISTRICTS WITH THE US EPA FOR THE INJECTION WHILE WITH CITIES WITH COUNTIES WITH- POSSIBLY STATE LANDS COMMISSION IF YOU GONNA BE BUILDING A PIPELINE SO IT'S A IT'S A CONVOLUTED. REGULATORY PICTURE BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE LOOKED AT IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES HAVE YOU DONE ANY MODELING ON OUR CURRENT CAP AND TRADE GETTING US THERE VERSUS. A CARBON TAX OR OTHER MEANS OF. MAKING THIS PENCIL OUT IN AGAIN KEEPING IN MIND THE URGENCY. OF THE CRISIS WE CAN'T WORK BACKWARDS AND SAY WE DIDN'T GET IT RIGHT WE CAN NEED TO GET IT RIGHT SKINNER RATHER THAN LATER. YEAH WE FULLY SECOND THE IN THAT SENSE OF AND- SO MOST OF THE- IF YOU SEE THE BIG PILLOW WAS. TURNING BY MESSENGER FUELS TRANSPORTATION FUELS SO ADD WASTE- FITTINGS FROM FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS. AND THE GREEN PORTION OF THE BY JENNY PORTION OF TRASH MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE. THE BEST THING TO DO WITH THOSE IS. MOSTLY TO TURN THEM INTO TRANSPORTATION FUELS NOT TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY SO THE NATURAL MATCH OF POLICY INSTRUMENT THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY HOUSE IS THE LOW CARBON FUEL SAN. AND THIS IS THE OF THE HIGH VALUE PROPOSITION RIGHT NOW FOR DEVELOPERS AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE WHERE THE- THE MOST STUBBORN SOME OF THE MOST AUBURN EMISSIONS HAPPEN TO. TWO WEEKS SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS THE BEST USE FOR THAT RESOURCE. THANK YOU. SO I HAVE A NUMBER OF A QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE FIRST ONE IS. ARE WE LOOKING AT. NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AFTER COMPLIMENTS OR AS A REPLACEMENT TO SOME OF OUR REDUCTION POLICIES WE HAVE NOW YES MISTER PRESS NO ABSOLUTELY AS A COMPLIMENTS WE NEED TO GO FLAT OUT ON ALL THE ON GOING MITIGATION EFFORTS AND AS MISS JANET GOALS OUTLINED WE NEED TO COME UP WITH NEW WAYS TO ACCELERATE AND DEEPENED THOSE MITIGATION EFFORTS. THE NEGATIVE EMISSIONS AT SOME OF THE WE PRESENT OUR WHAT WE THINK WILL BE NEEDED ON TOP SO THIS IS BY NO MEANS SETTLED THE CHECK THE CLOSE THE DOW IS WHAT WITH LOOKING JUST TO BE CLEAR HELLO FOLKS GET OURSELVES HERE NATALIE. THANK YOU SO THEN THE OTHER PART ABOUT YOUR REPORT TALKS ABOUT THE COOL BENEFITS TO OUR QUALITY OUT THERE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR A LONG TIME I LIVE. UP IN I LIVE IN ONE OF THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHERE I'M- 5% MOST POLLUTED ERA. OF THE- OF THE STATE AND I HAVE THE LUXURY OF MY OPEN SPACES THE RIVER BED THAT'S OF CONCRETE JUNGLE NEXT TO THE FREEWAY. I'M NOT ALWAYS SURE GOING FOR A WALK IS THE HEALTHIEST FOR ME EVEN THOUGH I NEVER SEEM TO GET ENOUGH THAT SENT. TO MAKE HERE AND SO CAN YOU QUE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT TASTE IS THAT. WHAT BY THAT. IN THE I GET THIS CALL THE- NO IT'S THIS POINTS BUT WE SEE THE VERY CLEARLY THE- BIO FUELS WE CREATE FROM THE WAIST BY MASS WOULD REPLACE FOSSIL FUELS ON THE ROAD SO IF YOU'RE REPLACING. DIESEL FOSSEL THE WITH HYDROGEN. THERE'S AN IMMEDIATE EQUITY BENEFIT THE ROAD FROM HEAVY TRUCKING. IF WE CAN DO AWAY WITH THE PRACTICE OF BURNING WOODS WHICH HAPPENS IN BOTH AGRICULTURAL AREAS BUT ALSO AS A RESULT OF. EITHER INTENTIONAL OR A WILDFIRE THAN. WE'VE SEEN WHAT THOSE DAYS CAN ACTUALLY DO IN IN THE FALL FIVE SEASON IF WE CAN TAKE THAT. THAT BURNING AWAY TO SOME EXTENT AND STERN AND TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUELS AGAIN WE SEE A DIRECT BENEFIT. SYLLABUSES BE TRUE WERE DISABILITIES. WOULD BE LOCATED IN THESE COMMUNITIES THEY ALSO SEE. IMPROVEMENTS ARE WHERE THEY CONTINUE TO. MAYBE WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY AN UNDUE BURDEN FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM. ABSOLUTELY SO THE HAVE THE BY A CONVERSION FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE TALKING OF BEEN NO RELATION TO THE- BIOMASS PLANTS OF THE PAST THE WE'VE COME TO KNOW ALL TOO WELL IN WHICH BECAUSE A- VERY MARKET IMPACT ON ON THAT QUALITY. THIS IS A COMPLETELY NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT DOES NOT SUFFER FROM THE- FROM THE SAME POLLUTION PROBLEMS AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. A GENERATION OF PLANTS THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. SO YOU WOULD EXPECT SEE YOU EXPECT THAT WE WOULD HAVE. SEEN OUR IN DC DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS WIDE THAT COOL BENEFITS EXPECTED. BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE YET I THOUGHT BECAUSE WHEN WE DID AB THIRTY TWO. WE SAID THAT WE WERE GONNA GET CLEANER AIR AND TEN YEARS LATER WE SAW THAT THAT WASN'T TRUE AND SO WHAT WE ACCEPT A LOT OF GREAT CALL BENEFITS. THIS WEBER FELT IT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE- BUT WE WERE WE ALL PAY INTO THE SYSTEM ON AND SO I JUST AMONG ALL THE LITTLE HAS A TEN OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE NOT QUANTIFIED. RELEASES THIS ADVICE COMMUNITIES OUT THERE. SO IT WOULDN'T LOOK NO ANALYSIS THE ERROR THE WOODS. IMPROVED OUR A FREEWAYS SO HEAVY ROADS TRY. AND PASSENGER CARS. AND ALSO AREAS WHERE FARMING IS PREVALENT SO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WOULD BE A DIRECT BEEN OFFICIALLY IN THESE HAPPEN TO COINCIDE. PRETTY WELL WITH THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND FROM THE PILOTS AYE AYE A MAYBE MY KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED BUT I'VE I'VE LOOKED INTO THE CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT SMALLER SCALE PILOTS BUT WHERE I'VE SEEN IT HAS I'VE SEEN IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH. BILL AND HAS BEEN OF RECOVERY AND WHICH SEEMS TO BE CONTRARY TO WHAT WE WANT TO FOUR FOUR ARTICLES HERE. ON AND SO. IS SCALABLE IT HAD AND CAN WE AFFORD THIS IS IT SEEMS TO BE REALLY EXPENSIVE TO GO DOWN THIS ROAD AND SO I THINK THOSE BACK TO MR MUNNINGS QUESTION JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW HOT. HOW DO WE GET THERE HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT. YES SO THIS IS BY NO MEANS PREDICATED ON ANY REVENUES FROM INJECTING CO TWO AND GETTING ADDITIONAL ALLOWS. THE CAPACITY ESTIMATES THAT WE PRODUCED IN OUR REPORT. THE SOLELY AND ROCKS- INDEPENDENT OF ANY OIL GAS PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH IN A TRULY EXCEPTIONAL. DEEP YOUNG BASINS THAT OF. THE RIGHT PROPERTIES TO TRAVEL CO TWO AND A LOT OF SPACE MANY CENTURIES WORTH OF SPACE. TO KEEP ITS AND ACTUALLY THE- TRANSPORTATION AN INJECTION COSTS IS A IS A VERY SMALL FRACTION. OF THE TOTAL WITH THE WITH THE REAL EXPENDITURES WAS REQUIRED AS AND BUILDING THE BY MASS CONVERSION PLANTS NOT. TRANSPORTING THE CO TWO ASTORIA. THERE. OKAY WELL THEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD WITH ME THANK YOU TO GET A START AT THIRTY FIVE FOUR TWENTY SEVEN OZ SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION I LOOK FORWARD TO THE ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DIRECTION WE MOVE IN IS AND ALWAYS CARE BUT THE SENSE OF URGENCY AT THINK IT'S CLEAR TO ALL OF US IN THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE AND HAVE A HOLD. OF A SUITE OF ITEMS THAT WE LOOK AT- ALONG THE WAY WITH REDUCTIONS- BEING OUR ULTIMATE GOAL HERE SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU WE WILL BE HAVING A SERIES OF HERE HE'S HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT TOPICS ALL THANK YOU PUBLIC COMMENT ON. I THINK. COMMENT I APOLOGIZE. YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED DON'T COLLECT AND I NEED TO CUT YOU OFF I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE BEING. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO THE AYE LEVIN WITH THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HOLDING THE HEARING AND THE- PANELISTS FOR THE GREAT WORK THAT THEY'RE ALL DOING. IT MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE REPRESENTING THE BUYER WINTERS HE SAYS HE'S IN CALIFORNIA BUT I JUST WANNA SAY UP FRONT THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD PROJECTS. INTO YOUR QUESTION MADAM CHAIR. AND THERE ARE WAYS THAT BIOENERGY CAN PROVIDE MUCH GREATER BENEFITS FOR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND LOCAL COMMUNITY RESILIENCE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO GET TO THE HUNDRED ARE SORRY EIGHTY THREE MILLION METRIC TONS THAT MISTER PERRY DOS TALKED ABOUT THE BIO ENERGY. CAN PROVIDING CARBON NEGATIVE EMISSIONS. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITY SCALE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY BIOENERGY THAT'S ONLY USING ORGANIC WASTE WE SHOULD BE GROWING FOOD. CROPS THE PURPOSE OF ENERGY PRODUCTION WE SHOULD BE TAKING. HELP THREE. BREAST PRODUCTION. WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH WASTE THEY WERE EITHER BURNING OR LAND NOW THAT CAN BE USED FOR ENERGY WE ALSO SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY SCALE FACILITIES THERE'S NO REASON TO HAVE ENORMOUS UTILITY SCALE FACILITIES THAT REQUIRE TRANSPORTING ORGANIC WASTE OVER LONG DISTANCES USUALLY WITH DIESEL POWERED TRUCKS- AND FINALLY WE SHOULD BE USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES COMBUSTION BURNING LOGS SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT WITH CAVEMEN WE HAVE MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN USE IN CALIFORNIA NOW SO IF IT'S FOOD WASTE TO PROCESSING WAY STARING THE NEWER WE SHOULD BE USING ANAEROBIC DIGESTION WHICH ALSO CAN PRODUCE DIGEST DATE. WHICH CREATES THE HIGHES VALUE CLEANEST COMPOST AVAILABLE IF IT'S WOODY WASTE REMOVED FOR WILDFIRE REDUCTION OR AGRICULTURAL WASTE WALNUT SHELLS THINGS THAT HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE VALUE OR THE WOOD WASTE CURRENTLY GOING TO LANDFILLS WE CAN GAS OF AYE IT AND PRODUCE BOTH ENERGY AND BIO CHAR WHICH CAN PROVIDE PERMANENT CARBON SEQUESTRATION THESE ARE MUCH CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES WITH A LOT OF BENEFICIAL BY PRODUCTS THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO MOVE TO DO THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SMALL SCALE BY WHAT SHE PROGRAMS IS THE BIO MAT PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATE A STATE LET'S JUST TEN SB. ELEVEN TWENTY TWO. IT REQUIRES TO FIFTY MEGAWATT. SMALL BY WINNERS FACILITIES BUT CALIFORNIA'S TECHNICALLY AVAILABLE ORGANIC WASTE COULD BE PRODUCING FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. OF NEW SMALL SCALE BIOENERGY SO WE NEED TO INCREASE THAT. REQUIREMENT AND WE NEED TO SPREAD IT NOT JUST AMONG THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BUT SINCE MORE MORE OF OUR ELECTRICITY IS COMING FROM COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS. AND PUBLIC UTILITIES ALL ELECTRIC SERVICE PROVIDER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN THAT PROGRAM. AND WE NEED TO ACCELERATE INTERCONNECTION IT'S WAY TOO HARD TO GET NEW BIOENERGY EVEN SMALL SCALE BIOENERGY. THAT'S CRITICAL EVEN UTILITIES IS THAT IT'S CRITICAL TO MAKE MICROGRAPHS MORE RESILIENT AND LONGER DURATION. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PUT IT IN THE PIPELINE AND ON THE TRANSMISSION LINES IT TAKES YEARS TO CONNECT THESE NEW SMALL SCALE BIOENERGY PROJECTS. TO THE ELECTRICITY GRID ON THE PIPELINE GRIT. AND WE SHOULD BE PUTTING MORE FUNDING INTO THESE PROGRAMS. AND THERE IS JUST NO WHERE NEAR ENOUGH FUNDING CONSIDERING THESE ARE NOT ONLY CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE OUR CHEMICALS BUT ACCORDING TO THE LA THEY'RE ALSO THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS. AS MANY. OF ANY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDED PROGRAMS. THE BIO ENERGY RELATED PROGRAMS ARE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE ON AVERAGE INTENT. COST OF ALL TIME. I THE STATE. SO THEY MAY FROM EVERY SEMI THE LAST THING I WANT TO MENTION IS COMMUNITY RESILIENCE I KNOW THAT'S A BIG TOPIC THIS YEAR AND- THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN FOR YOUR- LEGISLATION- ON BOND. WINNER GEE IF IT'S LOCAL ORGANIC WASTE GOING TO LOCAL ENERGY SUPPLIES CAN REALLY REAL INCREASE LOW COMMITTEE RE. AND PROVIDE THIRTY WITH NOT A LEVEL NGUYEN. RIGHTS SO NEED TO IT. IN NEW. BASS TECHNOLOGY BY GENERATE THANK YOU.BOB I AND STILL JUST AS YOU'D BE MY- COLLEAGUES BEHIND THE- THANK YOU. WE HAVE. PORTABLE ALL THE THAT ARE BEING A PILOT IT RIGHT NOW ALL THE RESEARCH IS BEING DONE- MOBILE SCALABLE- BIO ENERGY THAT CAN CREATE AND SEQUESTER BIO CHAR IN THE FOREST ON THE AG LANDS AND EVEN YOUR LANDFILLS IS AVAILABLE TODAY THERE ARE FIVE EXISTING PROJECTS UNDER THE NET ENERGY NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM AT THE P. YOU SEE. YOU CAN DEVELOP MORE THROUGH BIO MAT DO MORE THROUGH THERE YOU CAN EXPEDITE CITING BY USING THE NAM PROGRAM BUT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS AND AGAIN BALANCING AS CHAIR NICHOLS POINTED OUT THE HEALTHIER ARE NATURAL- WORKING IN THE WILD WORKING LANDS ARE THEY HEALTHY OR WILL BE IN CITIES AND ELSEWHERE TO THAT REDUCING THE THERE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THOSE LANDS THE PROJECTS ARE WHAT WHAT DOES THAT THE TECHNOLOGY HERE TODAY. WE JUST NEED TO KEEP. THIS KATHY VAN AUSTIN I REPRESENT UNITED AIRLINES AND- REALLY APPRECIATED HEARING- THE COMMENTS TODAY IT HELPS US KNOW. WHERE WE'VE COME FROM HOW FAR WE'VE GONE WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AND A TODAY'S. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM ME AS AN INDUSTRY THAT HUSBAND SO FAR AND TAPPED IN THE G. H. EMISSION REDUCTIONS DISCUSSION- THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION INDUSTRY. OF FEDERALLY REGULATED THEY JUST HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED- AS A STATUS DEVELOPED ITS POLICIES WE HAVE A COALITION OF AIRLINES AIRPORTS RENEWABLE FUELS COALITIONS I'M UC DAVIS- A FEW OR AVENUE SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL PRODUCERS. WHO WANT TO COME TO LEGISLATURE COLLECTIVELY- SHOW YOU WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO WHICH IS A UNITED HAS BEEN FLYING ON A SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW OUT OF LA ACTS- THERE'S GREAT DEMAND AMONG THE AIRLINES FOR THOSE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TRULY CONTRIBUTE. TO THE ACTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE CAN DO GROUND MEANT. WE CAN REPLACE THAT WE CAN DO THE SHUTTLE BUSES WHICH CARB JUST REQUIRE LAST YEAR. BUT THAT PALES PERSON AS TO WHAT INDUSTRY CAN DO USING. ESSAY OFF SO WE WILL BE COMING TO EACH YOU TO MEET WITH YOU AND WITH A THE NEXT OF WEEKS. TO TALK ABOUT THOSE TO TALK ABOUT. KIND OF PART WE LIKE TO SEE WITH THE STAY WE THINK THAT BY TWENTY FIFTY OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE OUR GHG EMISSIONS BY FIFTY PERCENT- TO DO THAT WE NEED THIRTY FIVE NEW. PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN THE STATE WELL IN THE STATE OR ELSEWHERE WE'D LIKE TO SEE IN THE STATE BECAUSE WE LIKE THE JOBS COME HERE- BUT IT'S AN EXCITING DISCUSSION WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE IT. AND WE'RE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU SO WE'LL LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS EVAN EDGAR ENGINEER FOR THAT CALIFORNIA COMPOST COALITION. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPASS COLLISION AS WELL AS THE FLEET. WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO COLLECT THE GARBAGE. WE HAVE THE TONS OF URBAN WASTE FOR SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. RIGHT NOW. WE ARE MAKING CARBONATED A FUEL. LINE AND ONE OF MY FACILITIES I GOT FIVE MORE COME ONLINE SO WE'RE MAKING CARBON AND THEY GIVE COVERED FIELD TODAY. USE AND THE CARD PATHWAY. PLUS YOUR NET ZERO TODAY UNDER THE CARDS COPING PLAN TO THE REFUSE INDUSTRY. DON LANDFILLS. WE COLLECT THE GARBAGE IN ORGANICS. AT THE AT THE CURB WE TAKE TO PROCESSING. MAKE ARE MINIMAL NATURAL GAS MAKE COMPOST AND WE CALL IT BACK TO THE FIELD. ALL THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE ORANGE WE MAKE SO WE ARE THE CLOSED LOOP SUBCIRCULAR ECONOMY TODAY. AND WHEN WE HALL THE FUEL AROUND WITH A CUST THE CARBON AND BY WITH HER BACK TO THE SOIL. SO THE REFUSE INDUSTRY THE COUPLE'S COALITION. OR ABOUT BIG SOIL NOT BIG OIL. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. OR GET OFF DIESEL WE'LL GET OFF LANDFILLS. WE'RE DOING IT TODAY WITH SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WITH TECHNOLOGY TODAY. WHETHER WE GOT TO PRESERVE IS ARE NEAR ZERO KNOCKS FLEET BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN ORDER TO USE OUR ORANGEY. OR NEAR ZERO WITH KNOCKS. TODAY WERE PRESERVED- REDUCING KNOCKS. I GET OFF DIESEL BY GOING TO THE COMINGS WESTPORT ENGINE. FOR USE THAT IN STATE ORANGEY GAS WAS CARBONATED F. EVER MAKE IT OR- COM. WITH IN NEW JERSEY PASSES AGO BACK TO THE ALL. SO WE ARE SICK. BIG CAR. WE NEED A PRESERVE THE- FLEET NEEDS TO PRESERVE NEAR ZERO. IN ORDER TO KEEP ALL COLLECTED ORGANICS. NEAR ZERO MINUTE. NOT AND HE- GREENHOUSE REDUCTIONS THOSE CAR TODAY. WHERE DO NETWORK THE LOOP. AND WE'RE GOING BACK TO TWENTY THREE CALLS THE POLICE PRESERVE THE REST IS FULLY NEAR ZERO KNOCKS TRUCKS. THANK YOU. THANK HIGH THEIR BODY BY OLD AGAINST. I THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY THE PRESENTATION HIGHLIGHTED SOME USEFUL FORMS OF BIOMASS RECYCLING THE JUST COMPOSTING AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTION- THE OFFER HUGE BENEFITS FOR BOTH THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMY HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THESE PREVENTIVE KNOWLEDGE USE ARE BEING CONFLATED USE OF MUNICIPAL. SOLID WASTE AS FUEL- FOR SO CALLED CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES ARE THIS IS NOT A RENEWABLE SOURCE OF ENERGY GIVEN THE HIGH FRACTION OF FOSSIL FUEL DERIVED PLASTICS IN THE WASTE STREAM ADDITIONALLY LIFECYCLE ANALYSES HOW FOR NEARLY ALL MATERIALS SHOW THAT THE SIGNIFICANT- AND SAVINGS RECYCLING MATERIAL. FIRST STRAPPING NATIONAL ORDERS TRANSPLANT. SELLING AND IT ACTUALLY BURNING IT FOR ENERGY. ABOUT WHY THIS. ISN'T COUNT WILL DRAW FROM A SOLID AS AND- UNDER THE OUR PS AND WHY THE LEGISLATURE HAS REPEATEDLY. TOUTED AS A TEMP TO CHANGE THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MARK THANKS. CAN AFTERNOON MY DEALER FOR CAL RELIEF WANT TO THE CAN FOR THIS. I GIGI AND IN WITH SOME EMPHASIS ON OUT RE AS A CALL EFFECTIVE CARBON SINK WE WANT TO FOCUS OUR COMMENTS THREE FOR WE ARE JUST TO SEE THE EXCLUSION UP URBAN FORCES AS A G. G. RID. ELEMENT IN THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE REPORTS SALLY THE REPORT GLOSSES OVER THE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION AVOIDED THROUGH URBAN FORESTRY AS DETERMINED BY THE CALIFORNIA FOR IS CALLED CARBON PLAN AS YOU MAY KNOW THESE REDUCTIONS ARE. OCCURRING IN SOME OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED AND URBAN UNDERSERVED AREAS IN THE STATE USING LAWRENCE LIVERMORE'S. ALL QUICKLY CAN. THAT TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF CO TWO PER YEAR CAN BE CAPTURED THROUGH. CALIFORNIA'S NETWORKING LANDS URBAN FORCES CAN WOOD AT 10% TO THAT FIGURE- CONSEQUENTLY WE WANT WITH LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE. TO CONSIDER AN ADDITIONAL HEARING TO TAKE. TO TAKING A DIVE INTO NOT TO WORKING LANCE AS DEFINED IN THE PUBLIC RESOURCE CODE. TO INCLUDE URBAN FOR SHARING GREENING AND OTHER RESOURCES AND AS IT RELATES TO THIS ISSUE. A SECOND DESPITE THE FACT THAT NATURAL RESOURCES ARE LONG TERM COST EFFECTIVE GIGI REDUCTION MECHANISMS. INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS ARE MINIMAL AT BEST- FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL GIGI ALLOCATION PLAN FOR THE YEAR AND THE LAST. I CONTAINS FOR FORESTRY URBAN GREEN AND WETLANDS OF THERE FOR THE LATEST LEGISLATURE MáS. BE THE LEADER NEEDS TO IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE INVESTMENTS INTO AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND THEN FINALLY WE WANT TO STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING CONCERNS RAISED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY- WHEN IT COMES TO YOU CAN. CREATE IN THE PATHWAY TO ACHIEVING OUR GOALS- AS ADVOCATES AND GRANT ADMINISTRATORS- CALIFORNIA RELIEVE RECOGNIZE THE TREMENDOUS NEED TO HAVE AUTHENTIC. RECOGNITION ENGAGEMENT FROM THE EBAY COMMUNITY SO YEAH. AND THANK YOU AGAIN. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS BILL MCGAVIN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR BUT YOU'RE ALL GOING TO BE VOTING ON THE BUDGET SO I WANT TO STRESS THE POINT THAT CHAIR GARCIA MADE EARLIER THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY CUT FUNDING FROM THE CURRENT YEAR FOR BOTH COMMUNITY OUR PROTECTION AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND IN FACT WE NEED FOR THOSE NUMBERS TO BE GOING UP. CHAIR BECAUSE IN HER TEAM SAID THE US REGULATORY STAY IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY FOR CLEANING UP OUR ENGINES WE NEED TO COMPLEMENT THOSE REGULATORY STANDARDS WITH INVESTMENT. BOTH TO ADVANCE THE TECHNOLOGIES TO EVEN CLEANER ENGINES AND ALSO TO HASTEN THE TURNOVER FROM THE OLD DIRTY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT TO THE NEW MUCH CLEANER ZERO MISSION AND NEAR ZERO MISSION. TECHNOLOGIES SO FOR THAT WE DO NEED FUNDING. AND WE NEED TO HAVE IT ON A CONSISTENT SUSTAIN BASIS NOT. ANGEL IN GOING UP AND DOWN YEAR TO YEAR SO I KNOW EVERYBODY WANTS MONEY AND THE BUDGET IS TIGHT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE'RE EMISSIONS ARE GOING UP. IT'S IN TRANSPORTATION WHERE MOST OF THE EMISSIONS ARE COMING FROM IT'S IN TRANSPORTATION SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT ALL WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING THE FUNDS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBER THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MESA PACIFIC FOREST TRUST- I WANT TO HONE IN ON. THE NETWORKING LANDS PART OF THE CONVERSATION PARTICULARLY SOMETHING- THE DIALOGUE THAT VICE CHAIR STERN AND TERRY NICHOLS WERE HAVING ABOUT THE- IMPORTANCE OF NETWORKING LANDS THE INCREASING EMISSIONS THERE AT A LARGE CHUNK OF THE MISSIONS THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE INVENTORY WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME. AND THE FACT THAT IT'S THE CHEAPEST PLACE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GET THE NEGATIVE REDUCTIONS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATION PRESENTED TODAY. IT'S REALLY IN ALL OF THE ABOVE- APPROACH DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WITHOUT TO WORKING LANDS AND THEN BIOMASS AND THEN THE MORE EXPENSIVE OPTIONS AS WE- MOVE ACROSS THE CHART. WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN IN THAT'LL WORKING LANDS. WE HAVE A MASSIVE DISCONNECT WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE THERE AND THE AND PASS BUDGETS. AND HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY PLAYING- FUNDS ON THE GROUND IT'S ALSO GOING ON TO SENATOR ALLEN AS WELL AS THE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING IN THE ASSEMBLY AND IN THE ADMINISTRATION. BUT A CLIMATE BOND YOU KNOW WILL BE BETTER FOR AN ON STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING BUT THE INFUSION BE REALLY HELPFUL. AND WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO APPROACH THESE CHALLENGES IN A MORE. AMBITIOUS WAY WERE REALLY WORKING ACROSS LANCE AND CAME BACK INTO MORE REASON. CONDITION THAT SEQUESTERING CARBON A MORE STABLE WAY. RATHER THAN A ONE OFF PROJECT WE'VE BEEN DOING SO FAR SO. I'LL SEE YOU WITH THAT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI MY NAME IS JAN WARREN I'M WITH THE INTERFAITH CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK A CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AND WE HAVE FOUR EFINERIES AN ARC. COMMUNITY OF. IN A DECEMBER THE FIFTH I WAS IN OAKLAND ATTENDING A CAR MEETING AND WE WERE APPRECIATED THEM COMING OUT LOCALLY. TO AWARD THE WEST OAKLAND COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PLANS PARTY AB SIX SEVENTEEN. LOT OF GOOD TURN OUT APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS- ABOUT- PIONEERING COMMUNITIES FROM. MERRY BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT TWENTY YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN TWO AND A HALF YEARS SINCE THIS BILL WAS PASSED AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR A- JUST. A LITTLE BIT OF CLEANER AIR. I HEARD A LOT OF PRAISE FOR THE FOR THE PROJECT THAT DAY BUT DESPITE THE WONDERFUL. REPORT IT WAS A PLAN THAT WAS APPROVED. AND THAT. PLAN NEEDS MONEY HAND US AS SEVERAL OF SAID IT'S BEEN CUT. AND THIS IS FOR A COMMUNITY THAT'S READY TO GOAL AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHERS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE'S NO MONEY FOR. A THEY'RE JUST WAITING SO WE NEED THIS THE TO GO BACK TO THE GOVERNOR AND- REALLY- PLEAD FOR. MONEY FOR THESE FOLKS WERE AT. I JUST SAW THE WONDERFUL- RIVERSIDE THE- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CARB FACILITY ONLINE AND THAT'S GREAT BUT- THIS IS WHAT WE ARE THEY DON'T WE DON'T GET MUCH BUT WE NEED THAT EVERY. BIT WE GET. I THANK THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT SB SIX SEVENTEEN WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME TODAY. TO SUPPORT TO THE RESTORATION INCREASE OF FUNDING. A I ALSO WORK SUPPORT TO YOU YOU LOOKING AT THE CAP AND TRADE- SO HER THREE COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THAT- ANXIOUS TO- PARTICIPATE AND CONNECT WITH YOU ALL. BECAUSE THAT'S THE REASON WE GOT AB SIX SEVENTEEN IT DIDN'T GET THE CAPS ON THE REFINERIES WITH- GHGS. AB THREE NINETY EIGHT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR. HI DAVID WEISS CAUGHT FROM NEXT IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CHARTER SEE- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS HEARING THIS IS- IMPORTANT VENUE AND I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING AVAILABLE TO US AND HAVING THIS INFORMATIVE PRESENTATIONS. I'D LIKE TO SO SEE MY COMMENTS WITH THE REMARKS FROM THE GOVERNOR EARLIER ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO DO MORE IT'S WHERE THE IT'S WHERE THE POLLUTION IS IT'S GOING UP HI AND IT'S BEING CUT IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET I THINK WE NEED TO RESTORE THAT AND GO FURTHER- I ALSO WANT TO. EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT YOUR NICKEL SAID EARLIER. THAT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF TOOLS THAT WE CAN DRAW MORE UPON- IN OUR STATE REGULATORY AND BUDGETARY AUTHORITY. TO HELP- DRIVE THESE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS DOWN. FOR EXAMPLE THE CAP AND TRADE DISCRETIONARY FUND IS A LITTLE BIT UNDER BILLION DOLLARS THE CDC ANNUAL BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS- AND ARGUABLY HAS MORE IMPACT ON OUR GHG EMISSIONS STATEWIDE- THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE BOARD I THINK- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO LOOK. AT WHAT ALL THE AGENCIES ARE DOING AND HOW- THE RULE MAKINGS AND SPENDING-PRIORITIES CAN BE BROUGHT IN LINE. WITH THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE CARBON TARGET- COME NEUTRALITY TARGET. I COULD JUST ANOTHER MY I WANT TO THANK THE NATIONAL- NATIONAL LABS FOR THE REPORT. AND REINFORCE- COMMENTS THAT CHARITY A MADE- THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DISTINGUISH NEGATIVE EMISSIONS FROM THE EMISSIONS INVENTORY- SO THAT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT SAY A PROJECT THAT USES- CARBON SEQUESTRATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF A LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD COMPLIANCE ARE THOSE TONS OF ALREADY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CONTENTS CONTEXT OF THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THOSE WOULD NOT BE ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE TONS AND- SIMILARLY WITH OTHER. PROGRAMS WHERE THERE'S OVERLAPPING EITHER INCENTIVES OR COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP. ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE EMISSIONS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM OTHER COMPLIANCE BASED TOOLS FOR THE EXISTING EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND REDUCTION PROGRAMS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON I FIRST ONE CAN ECHO WHAT ON THE PREVIOUS COMMENTER SAID AROUND CAN SEQUESTER OR LOOKING AT FOR NEGATIVE AND OTHER COMPLIANCE MECHANISMS KEEPING THOSE SEPARATE AND AN ADDITIVE I'M IN ALL OF OUR CLIENT PROGRAMS A COUPLE THINGS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKINGWITH MANY OF YOU ON CLIMATE BOND AND- G. G. R. F. AND CLAMOR RESILIENCE LOAN FUND- NEGOTIATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS OVER THE PAST FOUR MONTHS AND WANT TO FOCUS A BIT ON- TODAY'S PRESENTATION I JUST. WANNA MAKE REINFORCE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ON IMPACTS I THINK AS WE LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPANDING EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE COMMUNITIES NEARBY WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR WASTE FACILITIES NEED IT WOULD THAT THE COMMUNITIES NEAR. WASTE HAPPY MAKE SURE THAT BURDENS ARE EQUITABLY AND AS WELL AS BENEFITS AND SIMILARLY FOR REGION'S I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT OUR- CLIMBING SORRY DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN A GOALS IN UNITS. SO WHAT DO WE DO ON OUR ON. NEGATIVE COMMENT NEW. TO OLD EXT ECONOMIC P. IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT FINALLY I JUST WANNA GIVE A THAT THE PROBE THAT IS PRESENT TODAY IN THE HORNS OF IN. COMMUNITY FEEL AND COMMUNITY AND- IN PROGRAM TO THAT AND DELIVERY AND THAT'S WHERE E SEE THE BIGGEST SUCCESS THIS. THANKS SO MUCH. I AM AS A MINTON WITH VOICE FOR PRAGUE WHERE BAY LEADER AND BY. UNDER AND PLANTAR. AND WE WERE TO PROTECT AGAINST CLAY CHANGE I JUST WANT TO THANK THAT CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS. BECAUSE ALL OF YOU DO ADMIRABLE IN THIS ARENA. AND WE JUST WANT TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND SAY THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET PLEASE. AND INVEST MORE IN AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OBVIOUSLY. I IT'S A PROVEN STRATEGY TO REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE SEE IT GOING DOWN IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR AS WELL. THINK AGAIN AND- WE APPRECIATE THIS HEARING TODAY. CHAU SENATOR. MY NAME IS GARY HUGHES AND I WORK ITH A SMALL INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION CALLED BIO FEEL WATCH. AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY- THANK YOU TO COMMITTEE CHAIR GARCIA FOR BRINGING THIS TOGETHER. THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK HERE THERE'S ACTUALLY A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION THAT COULD BE BROKEN DOWN TO LIKE TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF. THE FIRST THING IS THERE'S A LOT OF A RONI ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FORCE MANAGEMENT BEING BANDIED ABOUT HERE- THERE'S A- HIGH DEGREE OF AMNESIA. FORGETTING WHAT'S HAPPENED TO CALIFORNIA'S FOREST'S. SEEMS TO BE A TOTAL ABSENCE TO REMEMBER IN THE PULP MILLS FOR INSTANCE THAT WERE ON HUMBOLDT BAY THAT I GREW UP WITH. AND THE DEVASTATION THAT OCCURRED IN THE FORCE IN THE STATE. SO ARE FOR. HAVE BEEN AND CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE TREAT. AS FEEDSTOCK. FOREST DEBRIS MATTERS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF IT IS THAT WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FORCES THAT THEY SERVE US IN RESPONDING THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE NEED TO STORED OUR FORCE SO FOR INSTANCE THE FACT THAT RAINBOW RIDGE GOT LOGGED LAST SUMMER. AND RAINBOW RIDGE OF COURSE PROPERTY THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL HUMBLED REDWOOD COMPANY. THIS HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO THAT THERE WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR FORCE. BUT I DO WANT TO BRING UP ANOTHER TOPIC THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S IN MY ROLE THE BIO FEEL WATCH I PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION CALLED HANDS OFF MOTHER EARTH. THERE'S A NUMBER OF GROUPS AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH- THE CLIMATE JUSTICE ALLIANCE FROM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IS INVOLVED. WE'RE WORKING WITH. FROM ALL AROUND THE WORLD ON THIS. AND WHAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED HERE BASICALLY IS A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED TODAY IS GEO ENGINEERING. DIRECT AIR CAPTURE IS SPECIFICALLY A GEO ENGINEERING TECHNIQUE BIO ENERGY WITH CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION BETTER KNOWN AS BACKS. IS GEO ENGINEERING. AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAY THAT TODAY AND IT'S I THINK IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AS WELL IT HAPPENED AT A NUMBER OF THE CARBON NEUTRALITY WORKSHOPS LAST YEAR. A THESE REFERENCES THESE EUPHEMISMS TO ARTIFICIAL SEQUESTRATION OF MECHANICAL SEQUESTRATION AND DIRECT. IT'S LIKE THESE MACHINES THAT WANNA BE INVENT THIS IS GEO ENGINEERING AND SO WE NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT AND SPEAK AND LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ENTERTAINING THE IDEA. OF EMBARKING UPON GEO IN NEARING. SO I BELIEVE. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S RISK. OF ELECTED OFFICIALS TO ENSURE THAT WERE BEING FULLY TRANSPARENT. WITH THE PUBLIC- THERE'S A LOT OF DANGERS WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES- ALONG WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR INSTANCE THE CREATION OF SALE OF CELLULOSIC BIO FUELS WOULD BE THE SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY THAT'S REQUIRED TO COULD BE EVEN IN GENETIC LEE MODIFY TREES. OR ALSO WITH THE MICRO ORGANISMS THAT ARE REQUIRED SO THESE THESE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT TOPICS THAT CAN GET TOUCH UP TODAY SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU MOVE FOR TALKING ABOUT. NEGATIVE EMISSIONS WHICH ARE REALLY NEGATIVE EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE'RE TRANSPARENT AMONGST OURSELVES AND WITH THE PUBLIC THE CALIFORNIA IS NOW ENDEAVORING TO. EXPLORE GEO ENGINEERING AS A RESPONSE TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. GET AFTER MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY FOR ME THEM PRIOR WIKI WITH FOR BY. DIVERSITY I REALIZE WE ARE ALL A FIVE SO I BE VERY SHORT. A LOT OF VERY INTERESTING TOPIC TODAY OBVIOUSLY THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OUR MEMBERS OUR ALLIES I'M SEE A LOT OF BENEFITS. TO CABIN NEGATIVE APPROACH AS WE WANT TO SEE- THIS WITH LOVE TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE SEE THIS COMMITTEE TO START TACKLING THOSE INDIVIDUAL PIZZAS. MANY OF THEM HAVE. BENEFITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR COMMUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND FOR OUR NATURAL ON WORKING LANDS THE ALL THAT HAVE THEN ADDITIONAL CO BENEFITS FOR THINGS LIKE WILDLIFE WATER ETCETERA. MANY OF THOSE ARE NO REGRETS IN THAT WE SEE THOSE BY HAVE AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WAYS THAT- THAT THE PLANTING MORE TREES ON OUR ON OUR STREETS ARE NOT GOOD AND ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF SPRING ARE GOING TO HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE TO- BE CONSIDERED. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CARBON IMPACT IMPACTS ARE. FORREST SOURCED WOODY BIOMASS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE NO REGRETS- ISSUES. FOR SERVICE WITH THE BIOMASS CARBON IMPLICATIONS ARE VERY PROJECT SPECIFIC SITE SPECIFIC AND PROCESS SPECIFIC. AND SO. THOSE A SUMP BE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO APPLY AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL TO COME UP WITH SOME OF THESE OVER ARCHING IDEAS OVER ARCHING- CONCEPTS OF THE OF THE GENERAL SCALE. ARE NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY APPLY AT THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT OF AND OF COURSE IT'S AT THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT LEVEL THAT YOU HAVE THE ACTUAL CARBON IMPACTS SO WE LOOK FOR TO MANY HERE ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES AND- I HOPE THAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM US IN PARTICULAR ON THE FOREST WOODY BIOMASS COMPONENT. THANK YOU. HELLO LAURIN COLUMN WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT- WE ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY BRENDA ACCUSE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. ALSO WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS TIME TO DISCUSS NEGATIVE EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES WHILE THE STATE CONTINUES TO PUSH FOR REAL CARBON. PRODUCTION REDUCTIONS. THERE'S A STRONG POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE TO SEQUESTER AND ENHANCE SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE WAYS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE EXPANDING NATURAL SINGS BY PLANTING TREES OR CULTIVATING AN ENCOURAGING HEALTHY SOILS SIX AFTER. MY COMMENTS YOUR GENERAL ABOUT SOME CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH A COUPLE OF TECHNOLOGIES MENTIONED IN THE CARBON I GET A REPORT. FIRST WITH THE REPORT IS FAR TOO GENEROUS TO THE BY MASS INCINERATION INDUSTRY. TODAY THE EXISTING INDUSTRIES NET EMITTER OF CARBON AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LOCAL AIR POLLUTION INCLUDING IN SOME. IN SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED PLACES IN THE STATE. ADDITIONALLY BIOMASS GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IS BARELY DEVELOPED IS NOT I CAN MAKE ALL THE- ALTHOUGH A LOWER. THAN CONVENTIONAL BYPASS AND CENTER. IT WILL BE A- FOR THE STATE PURSUE A QUE. OR MORE. ONE PULL ALL. EXIST FOR HANDLING FORCED WASTE. WE HAVE PRODUCED A REPORT AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT SOME POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO INCINERATION AND URGE YOU TO REVIEW THAT. SECOND IF THE STATE MOVES IN THE DIRECTION OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE THAT REQUIRE INJECTION AS PROMOTED IN THE REPORT WE NEED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T JUST BECOME AN OFFSET. TO ALLOW OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS IN THE STATE TO CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CARBON INJECTION IS NOT LINKED TO SEISMIC EVENTS AND WE NEED TO INJURE ENSURE THE ANY INJECTION OR AIR CAPTURE DOES NOT RELY UPON OR EXPAND THE USE. OF GAS FIRED ELECTRICITY PLANTS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS TO FIND REAL SOLUTIONS THAT PROTECT COMMUNITIES PRESERVE NATURAL LANDS. AND STOP OR USE OR RELIANCE POLLUTING FUELS CAME. HELLO MADAM CHAIR. COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND YOUR SPEAKERS MY NAME'S VERONICA PART ON BEHALF OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL. WE ARE A MEMBER OF THE ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS STRONGLY SUPPORT. THE COMMENTS MADE BY MS LEVIN- AT THE OUTSET OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT I DO WANT TO. THANK THE SPEAKERS FOR ADDRESSING SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE THIS IS A HUGE LEFT. FOR CALIFORNIA NEAR TRIPLING OF OUR CURRENT ORGANICS MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE MEMBERS THAT I REPRESENT- A COLLECTIVE PROCESS RECYCLING. MOVE THAT MATERIAL- TO RECYCLE CONTENT MARKETS AND FOR RECYCLING IN- COMPOST AND SOIL AMENDMENT SO THIS IS. SUCH AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR HAVING A CONVERSATION IN PARTICULAR AROUND THE WOODY BIOMASS. FEED STOCK IT'S A PARTICULAR FEEDSTOCK THAT'S HIGHS SO YOU LOST IT BEATS STOCK- LANDS TO CERTAIN APPLICATIONS. LOS SHOULD YOU KNOW WAS REALLY WELL WITH THAT OF FOOD WASTE AND AN AND WHAT GREEN BUT THE HIGH SO YOU LASIK WOULD WAYS HAVE POTENTIAL HERE AND SOBRE IT. THE CON. AND THE FOR TO FURTHER HERE THANK YOU. I NICHOLS HAD HONOR A JUST MY TODAY. I WANT TO THANK YOU IS ALL THE CHAIR OF A R. B. AS WELL AS LARA SLIM LABS REALLY. HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF NEGATIVE MISSIONS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THE UN'S IPCC SAID ALL PATHWAYS THE LIMIT GLOBAL WARMING TO ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS WITH LIMITED OR NO OVERSHOOT PROJECT THE USE OF CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES THEY CAME OUT WITH A REPORT LAST YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN SAY THEY SAY BY TWENTY FIFTY WE NEED TO BE REMOVING TEN GIGA TONS. OF CO TWO THAT DOUBLES TO TWENTY BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. WHAT WHAT I THINK THE MAIN TAKEAWAY TAKE FROM THESE PRESENTATIONS WE NEED TO BE THINKING NEGATIVE MISSIONS AS A NEW PILLAR OF OUR APPROACH TO COMBATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND RICHARD. TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FORTY FIVE CALLS. THANK YOU. GET A- MICHAEL BOCA OUR OWN. OF WESCO ADVISE FOR THE EVER CALL ENERGY. ASSOCIATE I THINK IT'S A GOOD MEMBERS NOW WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE'S DAIRY INDUSTRY. I LOOK FORWARD TO READING OFF THE WHOLE REPORT BUT- THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT WAS DESCRIBED OR TAKING. DURING THE NEWER AND TURNING IT INTO LOW CARBON NEGATIVE CARBON TRANSPORTATION FEELING CALIFORNIA TODAY. FOR MAKING COMPRESS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS FOR HEAVY DUTY FREIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO EVOLVE THAT. WE RECOGNIZE THAT'S PROBABLY A THE- A LIMITED TIME BUT WE'RE READY WORKING TOWARDS PRODUCING ELECTRICITY FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION. TO PROJECTS WERE JUST FUNDED BY CDFA LAST YEAR USING FEEL CELLS TO PRODUCE CLEAN ELECTRICITY. FOR EVEY CHARGING STATIONS IN THE STATE- THERE'S ANOTHER PERIL HERE AND THE DAIRY INDUSTRY'S PART OF THAT CIRCULAR ECONOMY- WHEN YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THE DURING THIS. INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA COWS ARE GREAT RECYCLERS OVER 40% OF THE FEED. WE USE IN THE CALIFORNIA THEIR INDUSTRY TODAY. COMES FROM OTHER AGRICULTURAL BYPRODUCTS ALMOND HOLES ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE WE EAT THE NUTS. THE SHELLS CAN GO FOR BIOMASS THE HOLES ARE GREAT CATTLE FEED. AND ALLOW US TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT SIGNIFICANTLY- UC DAVIS IS WORKING ON A- ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT- FOR THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'LL BE OUT THE NEXT WEEK OR SO IT'S CURRENTLY BEING PUBLISHED IN SO WE'LL SEE THAT VERY SOON COMING FORWARD. LAST ONE OF MY- A. THE STANDARD PROGRAM AND I THINK THE CAN SHOULD SET SOME TIME ON THAT. WE ARE INCREASING CA. ABOUT ALL CA PRO BECAUSE WE SEE A LOT OF OUR- STILL. GOING OUT TO STAY OUT OF STATE PRIDE. IN OF THESE PROJECTS INCLUDING SOME VERY PROJECTS AND OTHER STATES INDIANA NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE. OR ARE BEING PROVIDED EL CFS CREDITS EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL METHANE REDUCTION OCCURRING FROM THOSE PROJECTS THESE WERE EXISTING PROJECTS. THEY WERE PRODUCING ELECTRICITY OR FEELS FOR LOCAL. COMMUNITIES AND NOW THEY'RE PRODUCING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS FOR CALIFORNIA AND GETTING A WINDFALL A HUGE WINDFALL FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE GETTING NO BENEFIT FOR THOSE DOLLARS AND CLEARLY THE COSTS OF GETTING WERE CALIFORNIA WANTS TO GO OR GOING TO BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE. REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR DOLLARS LOCAL WE'RE NOT ONLY GET THE METHANE PRODUCTION HERE IN THE STATE WHICH WE NEED FOR SHORT LIVED I'M BLOOM PROGRAMS WE GET THE JOBS HERE. WE GET THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS HERE THAT MANY OF THESE PROJECTS PROVIDE. ONLY SEND THOSE DOLLARS OUT OF STATE WE GET NONE OF THAT IN MAY BE NO ADDITIONAL ALLEY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. HI GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR I CHECKS WITH ENERGY. AND TO POINTS THE THANKS FOR HAVING THIS IN. FORM THIS MERGING TO OF NAY BUT MISSION TECHNOLOGY AND FOR YOUR HELL FRAME. THAT WE NEED TO GO ABSOLUTELY FURTHER AND FASTER ON OUR MITIGATION STRATEGIES BUT THERE IS A ROLE TO LOOK FOR IN NEGATIVE EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND HOW WE CAN DO THAT. SAFELY BUT I WANT TO INVITE PERHAPS FURTHER PARTICIPATION FROM THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE HEARD. FROM OUR FORMER GOVERNOR ON AN EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY BUT WE HAVEN'T YET HEARD FROM. THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW THEY CONCEIVE OF THAT TARGET I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE CERTAINLY THAT THAT'S DIRECTIONAL GOING. AND AS A PLACE TO PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AOUT HOW THAT IT COUNTY SHOULD BE DONE. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT USING COVERAGE HOWDY AS AN EXCUSE TO LET OFFERED THE FOOT OFF THE GAS ON TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. WHERE WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS JUST LAST YEAR. NEW YORK STATE PASSED A BILL WHICH SET- THE NET ZERO. TARGET MID CENTURY BUT CLEAR COMING FROM. THE FOSSEL MISSIONS ESSENTIALLY WHICH IS HOW IT CALIFORNIA'S DOING THAT ACCOUNTING SO. DON'T LIKE NEW YORK JUMPING AHEAD OF US ON ANYTHING RELATED TO CLIMATE- HOPEFULLY WE CAN. HEAR SOMETHING FROM YOU GUYS SOON. AND SECOND AND YOU KNOW GOALS ARE IMPORTANT WE NEED TO KEEP SETTING GOALS BUT THE FOLLOW THROUGH IS REALLY KEY SO I THINK YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THAT. BEFORE PROPOSING BUT IT'S- THAT ARE CUTTING EMISSIONS ARE CUTTING FUNDING FOR KIßM THE REST. YOU KNOW WE THE FORTY. FOUR AND ALL. YOUR. TERRORIST ABOUT. THE ROLE OF CAP AND TRADE THE SCOPING PLAN WITH IS K. REALLY CALL THE GAP. AND I THINK WE ARE THAT THAT CRY. WHERE AGREE THAT THE CURRENT. NOT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES NOT. TO THAT NEED DAHLE. I THINK. OF REMOTE VILLAGES SAY THAT THEY HAVE AN EQUAL ROLE TO PLAY HERE AND THAT. WE CAN HAVE A MY HIGHER ON CARBON THAT'S NOT GONNA OVER ON THE COORDINATION CHALLENGES. PERMITTING IS. YOU KNOW WE CAN UPS ON AROUND AND IS WAS OTHER. WE KNOW OUR BE ABLE TO. ALSO AND WE. THANK YOU CHAIR FOR HOSTING THIS MEETING TODAY AND INFORMATIVE PRESENTATIONS. UP FOR QUICK POINTS SO AT THE END OF A LONG DAY AND IN A DARK TIMES IS SENATOR STERN MENTIONED I DON'T WANNA LOSE. SIGHT OF THE NUMBER AND TAKE AWAY FROM MISTER PARADIS IS- REPORT WHICH IS THAT WE CAN DO IT WE CAN CHIEF CARNAGE JOLLITY WE HAVE OPTIONS. TWO OF THOSE OPTIONS OTHER REPORT I WISH WE WOULD'VE SEEN TABLE E. S. FIVE- WHICH LAYS OUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SOLUTIONS OF THEM NATURAL WORKING LAND SOLUTIONS ARE- THE LOWEST COST. THEY'RE ALSO READILY DEPLOYABLE AND THEY HAVE THE MOST CO BENEFITS IN TERMS OF- BENEFITS TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD SECURITY. WATER RESILIENCE AND OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF THOSE CO BENEFITS AREN'T ACCOUNTED FOR THAT REPORT AND OFTEN ARE OVERLOOKED IN THE WAY WE ACCOUNT FOR ON. THESE INVESTMENTS. THE THIRD I WANT TO LINE US WITH THE- COMMENTS FROM OUR EASY COMMUNITIES AND COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN SAYING THAT ARE LIMITED PUBLIC RESOURCES THROUGH THE BOND IN THE BUDGET- MUST BE USED TO SUPPORT A JUST TRANSITION FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. A AND HAVE THE LEAST RESOURCES ACCESS TO FINANCE TO DAFT SO IN AGRICULTURE WHERE I WORK- THOSE ARE SMALL AND MID SCALE FAMILY FARMS. A SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND FARMERS OF COLOR AND FARMWORKERS. AND LASTLY- WE GREET THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT THESE AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION MEANING FULL SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE CARBON NEUTRALITY- MEASURES MUST INCLUDE THOSE COMMUNITIES AT THE OUTSET. I IN THEIR DESIGN AND CERTAINLY THEIR IMPLEMENTATION SO THANK YOU. I THANK YOU TO EVERYONE FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TO OUR PRESENTERS TODAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENTS- WE WILL BE HAVING. FOLLOW UP HEARING FROM SOME OF THESE TOPICS AS AS WE LOOK AT WE WANT TO GO- I WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I AM THE CHAIR ON A COUPLE OF THINGS AS WE TALK ABOUT. NEGATIVE EMISSIONS A NATURAL- AND WORKING LINES. AND THAT THAT WE LOOK AT THE URBAN FORESTRY THAT LOOK AT THINGS LIKE PRETTY NAY TREE CANOPY NEXT TO THE FREEWAY SO THAT TOOK MY DISTRICT. ON AND SO FORTH AND SAYS WELL AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LARGE SKILLS THAT WE CAN GO TRADITIONALLY IN OUR FOREST. THAT WITH A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT TO THE BUT WE ALSO THINK ABOUT URBAN OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT WE ARE DOING BOTH. LOCAL SMALL AND- LARA SCALE PROJECTS. THERE AND AS WE TALK ABOUT COOL BENEFITS AROUND CLEAN AIR SPECIFICALLY THAT WE ARE INTENTIONAL WITH THAT AND SO ONE OF THE TOOLS OF THE BE SIX SEVENTEEN AND- AS WE WERE REMINDED WE ONLY HAVE THE PLANS WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN IMPLEMENTED THEM YET AND SO DOLLARS TEMPERAMENTAL. CURRENT PLANS WITHIN YOU PLANS THAT ARE COMING OUT DOWN THERE BUT AS WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THERE'S JUSTICE. FOR ALL OUT THERE AND I THINK AS WE- LOOK AT THE REALITY THAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD A SENTRY TO GET TO WHERE WE'RE AT ACTUALLY TODAY- THAT WE- REVISIT EVERYTHING AND- IF- THIS I MEAN WE NEED TO GET RID US OF HOW DO WE STRENGTHEN WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND HOW DO WE SUPPLEMENTAL IT. WITH OTHER THINGS SINCE I THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OUR- ALL OF OUR TOOLS. AS WE LOOK AT COST EFFECTIVENESS NOT JUST LOOKING AT. THE DOLLAR BOTTOM LINE PROFIT MARGINS TO COMPANIES THAT WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE HEALTH. OF COMMUNITIES HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS AND- THE FUTURE HEALTH OF OUR OF OUR EARTH AND SO HAVING THAT ARE TO SEE THERE. ALONG THE WAY I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK I WANT TO THANK. MY COLLEAGUE MISTER GARCIA FOR. HIS WORK TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL IS PASSED THE THAT HAD. IS NO HAVE TELL ME TO. AND REFLECT AT LEAST. WHEN YOU'RE ON THE WORK WITH. COLLEAGUES WE NEED TO DO MORE ON. BUT I DO WANT TO THANK FOR LEADERSHIP. ON AND IS THERE TO LOT ON ON OUR GOALS HERE FOR. JUST TRANSITION SO WITH THAT WILL BRING THANK YOU.
