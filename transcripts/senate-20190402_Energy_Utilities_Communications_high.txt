WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENTER YOU ENERGY UTILITIES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS. WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE -- TO HEAR TESTIMONY ON TODAY'S AGENDA -- WE'RE GONNA START WITH US SENATOR CARL YET ALL -- SB FIVE ONE FIVE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM. WELCOME GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB FIVE ONE FIVE WHICH IS A NARROWLY FOCUSED BILL. THAT WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD FUEL FOR BIOMASS FACILITIES WITH BIRAM CONTRACTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ISSUED AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION CALLING FOR THE CPUC. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EXPIRING BIOMASS CONTRACTS AS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT AT THE TIME CALIFORNIA HAD AN ESTIMATED. HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES. HELLFIRE PUT TOGETHER A MAP COMIC COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS HIGH HAZARD ZONE MAP IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A DEAD TREE HITTING A POWER LINE OR BLOCKING THE ROAD. THE CPC RESPONDED BY REQUIRING THE UTILITIES TO PROCURE FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ACTED IN PASSED SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH REQUIRED THAT ANOTHER HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY BE PROCURED. IN ALL THERE ARE SEVEN CONTRACTS SIGNED AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO MANDATES AND THEY REFUSE REFERRED TO AS BIRAM CONTRACTS. ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED TO GET A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF FUEL FROM THESE HIGH HAZARD JONES. HOWEVER THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS REQUIREMENT IF IT FOREST WASTE THAT IS DEEMED TO BE FROM A HIGH HAZARD ZONE NOW COST MORE THAN FOREST WASTE THAT COULD CAUSE A A WILDFIRE. SOME OF THESE FACILITIES PAY A PENALTY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HIGH HAZARD ZONE FUEL WHICH WAS A RANDOM TARGET SAID ON THE LAST NIGHT OF SESSION. WE NO LONGER HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD TREES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE IT'S AN ESTIMATED HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DEAD TREES. WE HAVE AN UNHEALTHY AND OVERSTOCK FOR IS WITH EXCESS FUELS AND CATASTROPHE IN WAITING WITH REGARDS TO WILDFIRE. THE NAPA COUNTY WILDFIRES DIDN'T CONTAIN THESE HIGH HAZARD JONES AND NEITHER DID PARADISE RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL A DEVASTATING WILDFIRE DESTROYED THE COMMUNITY BEFORE REMOVING THE FUEL WE WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND TRY TO PREVENT THE NEXT MAJOR WILDFIRE. SB FIVE ONE FIVE EXPANDS AND IF MISSION OF HIGH HAZARD ZONE FUEL TO INCLUDE THE AREAS WITH IN AWHILE FIRE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT HELLFIRE ANNOUNCED EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AS WELL AS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CAL FIRES MAP WHICH SHOWS MODERATE HI AND VERY HIGH HAZARD ZONES. THE BILL IS SMALL BUT IMPORTANT. IT'S AN IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS AND ARE FORCED AND HELP PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES WHERE THERE IS EXCESS FEEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. TWO OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS. GOOD MORNING I'M JEFF OLSON A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTER WITH CASCADE RESOURCE CONSULTANTS ON I HANDLE FEEL PROCUREMENT BERNIE FORCE POWER. A BIOMASS ENERGY FACILITY IN EASTERN SHASTA COUNTY AS MY TESTIMONY WILL FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION ALSO MENTION A SERVER THE VOLUNTEER FIRE CHIEF OF MY TOWN AND ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH ALONG WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHERS. ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO HELP SAVE PARADISE FROM THE CAMPFIRE AN EXPERIENCE WHICH IS DRAMATICALLY HEIGHTENED MY SENSE OF URGENCY FOR REDUCING FIRE RISKS AND OUR FORESTS. LIKE MANY BIOMASS FACILITIES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BERNIE FORCE POWER NEARLY CLOSE ITS DOORS UNTIL WITH SAVE BY THE BY OUR AND PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWED PLANS TO CONTINUE OPERATING WHILE DIRECTING THEM TO SOURCE MATERIAL FROM HIGH HAZARDS ON THIS ACCESS TREE MORTALITY. AT THE TIME THIS MADE SENSE A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES WERE DEAD STATEWIDE HOWEVER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE STATE WAS RUDELY AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR FORESTS AND CITIZENS. HAD SHIFTED FROM DEAD TREES TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES CAPABLE OF WIPING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES OFF THE MAP IN MERE HOURS. CASE IN POINT WHEN COOPER MADE ITS HIGH HAZARD MAPS MULTIPLE WATERSHEDS COVERING PORTIONS OF PARADISE AND CON CAL TO NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE TREE MORTALITY TO WARRANT. DESIGNATION AS HIGH HAZARD FURTHERMORE NOT ONE OF THE EVACUATION ROUTES OUT OF PARADISE WAS DESIGNATED AS A HIGHER PRIORITY TEAR ONE'S OWN. NEITHER WAS A TRANSMISSION LINE WHICH ALLEGEDLY STARTED THE WORST FIRE IN STATE HISTORY. WITHOUT SUCH DESIGNATION BIOMASS FACILITIES SUCH AS BERNIE FIND THEIR HANDS TIED FROM HELPING TO REDUCTION EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS. I BELIEVE THESE FACTS ALONE IN LIGHT OF THE CAMPFIRE ILLUSTRATE THE THREAT HAS SHIFTED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE POWER AND PROGRAM. IN CLOSING I WOULD OFFER THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO BOMB OUTS FOR TREATING OVERSTOCK FORESTS. THE COMBAT THIS CRISIS I URGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRIORITIES FOR THE POWER IN PROGRAM MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE REDUCTION OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IN THE STATE WITH SB FIVE ONE FIVE BEING A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JULIE MALINOVSKY BALL REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BIOMASS ENERGY ALLIANCE -- I REPRESENT THE OTHER BY AROUND FACILITIES AND AND I KNOW THAT I REPRESENT THE INDUSTRY AT HAND TODAY AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS REPRESENTING THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES AND THE TO THE REGIONS WHERE THESE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED. SO WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE DEFINITION OF A HIGH HAZARD ZONE YOU'RE TELLING ONE COMMUNITY HEY ALL YOUR RESOURCE -- THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN YOUR FORCE RIGHT NOW. SOME OF THIS IS ELIGIBLE TO GO TO BUY A MASS PLANT BUT YOU TURN TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY THAT'S OUTSIDE THAT ZONE AND SAY EVERYTHING THAT YOUR WORKING ON TO MAKE YOUR FOREST'S SAFER. I'M SORRY YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BY ON THIS PLAN YOUR REGION BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT IN A SPECIAL ZONE. SO IN IN ONE INSTANCE YOU KNOW IT'S LKE FIND THEIR BIOMASS PLANTS WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO SURVIVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BUT IT'S THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TRYING TO SUPPORT BY CHANGING THIS DEFINITION. WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO -- THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER ANY EXISTING UTILITY PURCHASE CONTRACT. THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPACT CONSUMER COST. THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER ANY RULES FOR TIMBER HARVEST OR CHANGE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOWS FOR WASTE FROM FIRE PREVENTION FORCE PROJECTS TO BE EFFICIENTLY UTILIZED? AND IT RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA'S FORCED MANAGEMENT GOALS ARE EVOLVING. WHEN SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WAS AN ACTED ARE FORCED ISSUES WHERE THE DEAD AND DYING TREES IN THIS YEAR AS? SO THE BIRAM CONTRACTS COLD FOR DEALING WITH DEAD TREES. EARLIER THIS YEAR CAL FIRE EXPANDED THE CRITERIA. TO INCLUDE DEAD TREES FROM AREAS WERE FORCED FIRE HAD OCCURRED. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE MATERIAL THAT CAN BE USED IN BIRAM CONTRACTS FROM THE DEAD TREES AND THE BURN TREES. THOSE TREES THAT ARE AT RISK. THE FORCE FIELD THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED TO MEET OUR FIRE PREVENTION GOALS. LAST EVENING I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIR ABOUT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT HE IS -- SUGGESTING FOR THE BILL. I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT ALL OF THOSE AMENDMENTS WITH ONE MINOR EXCEPTION. CAL FIRE HAS DEVELOPED A MAP OF AREAS FOR FIRE RISK. I WE'RE ASKING THE BIO MASS. THIS REMOVED FOR FIRE PREVENTION PURPOSES IN AREAS THAT ARE VERY HIGH HI AND MODERATE RISK. BE ALLOWED FOR USE IN THE BIRAM CONTRACTS. THE CHAIRS PROPOSE THAT ONLY MATERIAL IN A VERY HIGH RISK ZONE BE ALLOWED. WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE REMOVAL OF THE MODERATE RISK ZONES. BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE WOULD REQUEST THAT DOES THE COMMITTEE CONTINUE TO INCLUDE. THE HIGH RISK ZONES. HIGH RISK ZONES INCLUDE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THIS YEAR FOR HILLS ARE OAK WOODLANDS AND CHAPARRAL ZONES. THESE ARE OFTEN THE AREAS WHERE WE SEE THE GREATEST IMPACT OF WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. SB FIVE FIFTEEN IS ACTUALLY SIMPLE BILL. WITHOUT IMPACTING EXISTING CONTRACTS OR SUPPORT CONSUMER COSTS IT ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS FIRE PREVENTION GOALS BY FISSION LEE UTILIZING FORCED WASTE FROM AREAS MOST AT RISK FOR FIRE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH ON BEHALF OF THE JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY RICHARD CARPENTERS MILL RICE MACHINISTS PAPER AND PULP WORKERS IN ABOUT SIX OTHER UNIONS AND WOOD PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. IN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES -- CURRENTLY OUR WORKFORCE. BY IN THE UTILITIES THAT ARE DOING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND LINE CLEARANCE HAVE TRIPLED IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WORK. THIS BILL IS SIGNED TO UTILITIES BY THE P. YOU SEE TO DO ALL THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON ALL THE THE FUEL. SO WE WENT FOR INSTANCE MPG THESE SERVICE TERRITORY FROM A WORKFORCE OF ABOUT A THOUSAND TO WORK FORCE OF ABOUT. THREE THOUSAND OUT THERE EVERY SINGLE DAY CLEARING BRUSH AND CUTTING TREES. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO PUT IT. SO WE'RE DOING UTILITIES OBLIGATION WE'RE CLEARING AT ALL WE'RE GETTING AWAY FROM THE LINES AND WE'RE GOING STORIES SOMEPLACE WHERE IT STILL REMAINS A FIRE RISK. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLACE TO PUT THE FUEL SO WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THE BILLS -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SUGGESTED BY THE OUR SPONSORS THANK YOU. AS WITH HER. RESEARCHER CHRIS FOR KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF HUMBLE MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES ALSO IN SUPPORT. KELLY BOYD ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA LOW CARBON FUEL AND ENERGY COALITION IN SUPPORT. BRIAN WHITE ON BEHALF OF THE FORCE LANDLORDS OF CALIFORNIA AND CAL FOR LESSONS FORCED ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MEN'S WEAR MUCH WITH WHAT I MEAN GROUP ON BEHALF OF I CHECKED OUR SERVICES AND SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING SYLVIA PRIME BEHALF HERE PACIFIC INDUSTRIES IN GREEN DIAMOND SUPPORT. JOHN KENNEDY ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTIES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING THEIR DOLPHIN HAPPILY TO CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ANYONE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU JEFF. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. MY NAME IS DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION TO SB. FIVE ONE FIVE BY MASS INCINERATION PRODUCES MORE CO TWO PER MEGAWATT HOUR THAN FOSSIL FUELS. BIOMASS INCINERATORS AMID HIGH VOLUMES OF CRITERIA POLLUTANTS THAT ARE LINKED TO HEART HEART AND LUNG CONDITIONS AND ARE COMPONENTS OF SMOCKS. IN A OF SMOG ENERGY PRODUCED AND BY. IN A BIO MASS INCINERATOR IS TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS WINTER SOLAR. AND BIOENERGY PROCUREMENT MANDATES. THIS PLACE TRULY ZERO EMISSION ENERGY AT RIGHT SPENCE. ALL THAT SAID SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA'S. TURNS WITH THIS BILL FAR EXCEED OUR GENERAL CONCERNS WITH BIOMASS INCINERATORS. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE FEED STOCKS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO MEET HIGH HAZARD FUEL REQUIREMENTS FOR BIRAM CONTRACTS. THESE REQUIREMENTS FR IMPLEMENTED. TO PRIORITIZE THE REMOVAL OF TREES THAT THREAT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY DESIGNATES THE ENTIRE FORCES ELIGIBLE FEEDSTOCK. IF IT PASSES. BY MASS INCINERATORS WILL SOURCE FUEL FROM THE CHEAPEST AREAS RATHER THAN FROM THE AREAS THAT POSE THE LARGEST THREAT TO HUMAN LIVES. FURTHER THIS BILL OVERSTAFFED A RECENT CPUC RESOLUTION TO ALLOW FACILITIES TO COUNT SALVAGE BIOMASS. TOWARD THEIR FEEDSTOCK REQUIREMENTS ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE COMMISSION. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH HIS COMMONSENSE AN ECOLOGICALLY CONSCIOUS RULING. WHEN FIRE BURNS THEIR COMMUNITY IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE BURNED TREES THAT ARE NOW FALLING HAZARDS FOR NEARBY HOMES AND INFRASTRUCTURE? HOWEVER WHEN A FIRE BURNED A FIRES OFTEN BURN AND WILD LANDS MILES AWAY FROM COMMUNITIES. WHEN THIS IS THE CASE IT IS UNNECESSARY AND DESTRUCTIVE TO LOG IN AREA THAT WILL REGENERATE NATURALLY THAT IS PROVIDING HABITAT AND THAT A SEQUESTERED IN CARBON IN LIVING AND DEAD TREES? IT IS THEN NONSENSICAL TO LOAD SEQUESTER CARBON INTO A DIESEL TRUCK AND INCINERATE IT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EXPENSIVE. AND CARBON INTENSIVE ELECTRICITY ALL AND RATE PAYERS TIME. SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IT SUPPORTS THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE BILL ANALYSIS TO DIRECT THE CPUC TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT NEW FEEDSTOCK DESIGNATIONS ARE NECESSARY. SHORT OF THESE AMENDMENTS SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA OPPOSES SB FIVE ONE FIVE AND ARE JUST YOU KNOW ABOUT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- NAMES BRENDA WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY HERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ON THE LIKE TO SOCIO MYSELF WITH. BOTH THE THE TO THE LETTER SUBMITTED BY SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE BY DANIEL AND I'M JUST GONNA HIT ON A FEW POINTS THAT ARE. BEYOND WHAT WAS ALREADY WHAT DOES RT STATED. I'M ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSE OF ONE OF THE MAIN PURPOSES INTENTIONS STATED THIS BILL IS TO DIRECT TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE -- FOR FOR BIOMASS TO BE. CARED FROM FIRES FROM FIRE AREAS AND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT IS ALREADY THE CASE WITHIN OUR CURRENT LAW. THAT THE CPC HAS THE DISCRETION AND HAS BEEN EXERCISING THAT DISCRETION TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW CONTRACTS TO TAKE. FEEDSTOCK FROM THE EXISTING -- FROM A EXISTING CONTRACTS THE TAKE FEEDSTOCK FROM BURNED AREAS THAT'S IN AS SOON AS WELL AS THOSE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE ALREADY IN THE THAT'S ALREADY IN THE WORKS AND HAS BEEN HAPPENING SECONDLY I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THOSE MAPS BUT TOGETHER -- THE HIGH IN VERY HIGH FIRE THREAD STONES AND ALSO THE THE TIER ONE AND TIER TWO AND TIER THREE SAYS -- PRODUCED BY -- BY THE CHIU MENTALITY TASK FORCE THAN THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE AND NOW THE CQC APPROVED WHEN YOU PUT ALL OF THOSE TOGETHER. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF ALL OF THE FORESTED AREA IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU ARE PUTTING OUT A NET? THAT WIDE THAT TREMENDOUSLY DILUTES YOUR ABILITY TO FOCUS THE REMOVALS THE FORCE WOULD REMOVALS FROM THOSE PLACES THAT YOUR GAMING TO BE TRULY HIGH RISK TO SAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING ACROSS MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF ACRES AND NOW ALL OF THOSE WOULD BE. AT THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIORITY COMPLETELY DILUTES OUR ABILITY TO DIRECT THIS EXPENSIVE. TOOL TOWARDS REMOVING FAT BM I AM AS FEEDSTOCK FROM THE FOREST NOT TO BE CLEAR -- BOMB AT THE BOMB AS FEEDSTOCK IN MY OPINION MY ORGANIZATION SHOULD NOT BE A DRIVING FACTOR FOR OUR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS IN THE FOREST IT SHOULD BE A TOOL AND NOT DRIVING WHERE AND WHEN WE PULL OUT. PULL OUT WOULD AND THAT IS VERY MUCH ARE CONCERNED AS WE LOOK AT BIO RAM IN THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND SECONDLY THERE IS MUCH DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE. EVEN IN AREAS WHERE IT'S ALREADY BURNED -- IF IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING THESE REMOVALS AS PART OF A PLAN ALL OF THAT SAID. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR PURPOSES OF THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF WHAT IS IN THERE IS ACTUALLY TAKING US AWAY FROM THE FOCUS. OF PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND FOCUSING ON AREAS WHERE FEET STOCK REMOVAL WOULD ADVANCE MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE. AND IN ASK THE COMMITTEE TO DO AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU -- TO HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF WHEN AND IF -- CENTER YOU CAN ANSWER THIS BUT I'M TRYING. TO ASCERTAIN OF WELL WE'VE SEEN OF UP INITIALLY. SEVERAL YEARS BACK I REMEMBER. A NUMBER OF OF DEAD TREES AT THE HEIGHT OF THE AT THE DROUGHT WE WERE LOOKING AT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION AND THEN THAT NUMBER SHUT UP TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION. AND I I I THINK THE CURRENT ESTIMATES ARE ON HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE -- THOSE NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS APPROXIMATELY [inaudible] OF NOT QUANTITY. HOW MUCH WAS STILL? AND REMOVED AN INCINERATOR BY BIOMASS. YOU HAVE A NUMBER IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MATERIAL. WE HAVE -- FROM MY UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TWENTY THREE BY A MASS PLANTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW MUCH MATERIAL HAS BEEN DEALT WITH SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN OR EVEN ON A PER YEAR BASIS OPERATING? AT FULL CAPACITY. HOW MUCH MATERIAL CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT? THESE CURRENT PLANTS A DEALING ON ASK ABOUT CALIFORNIA BY MASS ENERGY LINES I DON'T HAVETHE EXACT NUMBER FOR YOU I'M HAPPY TO DELIVER IT TO YOU BUT YOU IT'S INTERESTING THE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET AT IS. CAN THESE BIOMASS FACILITIES WHICH ARE. THERE AREN'T THAT MANY TAKING FORCE MATERIAL SO THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER ABOUT MASS FACILITIES TAKING FORCE MATERIAL THEY'RE ALL AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY ARE TAKING FORCE. RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THE SEVEN BIO RAM PLANS AND THEN A SMALL HANDFUL THAT AREN'T BY AROUND PLANTS THAT AREN'T ANYWHERE NEAR YOU KNOW HOW. MANY OF THOSE ARE SO. OF THREE FOUR SO WE CAN SAY MAY BE. ARE APPROXIMATE ABOUT TEN PLANTS. YES. AND APPROXIMATELY HOW MUCH MATERIAL OR THEY HANDLE IN. SO FULL BORE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN I TELL YOU THE EXACT NUMBER WE'RE TALKING HUNDREDS OF THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TONS OF MATERIAL EVERY YEAR. AND LARSON H. WOULD THAT BE OF THE AMOUNT OF TONNAGE THAT'S A THAT'S CURRENTLY. IN THE FOREST. SO THEY'RE JUST DEALING WITH IT REGIONALLY. SO THERE THAT THE COMMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS LIGHTS UP THE ENTIRE STATE IS -- ONLY TALKING AS IF I HAD BIOMASS PLANTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE SO IF I LOOK AT OUR REGION BERNIE FOREST POWER FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE JUST GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT'S NEEDED IN THEIR REGION IN THE MATERIAL THAT'S OUT THERE AND AVAILABLE IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT FACILITY ONCE YOU DO IS TACKLE WHAT'S WHAT YOU CAN REALISTICALLY GET AT IN THAT REGION AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING OUR REGIONAL SOLUTIONS NOT NECESSARILY STATEWIDE SOLUTIONS YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE JUST LIMITED YOU KNOW AROUND THE STATE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING THESE BIOMASS PLANTS ARE PROPOSING TO ONLY HANDLE STUFF IN AND AROUND THEIR VICINITY NUMBER. ONE AND THAT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH HI. OF VERY HIGH FIRE PRONE AREAS AROUND THOSE BIOMASS PLANTS I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IS THAT THE HIGH HAZARD ZONE AROUND ANY PARTICULAR. IN PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS YOUR BIO MASS FACILITY -- IT DOESN'T COVER EVERY HIGH PRIORITY AREA. HI HAZARD ZONES WERE DEDICATED TO DEAD AND DYING TREES. NGUYEN WE'RE NOW ASKING IN THIS BILL TO LOOK AT FIRE -- SEVERITIES. SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS IS THAT IN THAT REGION FOR EXAMPLE BERNIE FORCE POWERS SITTING RIGHT HERE COULD SPEAK TO THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY -- IN THEIR REGION THEY HAVE AREAS THAT ARE HIGH HAZARD ZONE AND AREAS THAT THEY CAN REASONABLY GET. TO THAT OUR HIGH FIRED HAZARD ZONES SO. WHAT IS TO SAY THAT THIS AREAS OKAY TO DELIVER MATERIAL TO THEIR BIOMASS PLANT IN THEIR REGION? THAT THIS THIS AREA CANNOT THAT'S WERE TRYING TO TACKLE HERE. ENOUGH AND IS DETERMINES THAT THE RAIN DETERMINE WHAT IS ACCESSIBLE WHAT ISN'T. USUALLY PRICE IS A GOOD -- FACTOR IS THE PROJECT THAT OUT THERE IS THERE IS THERE FUNDING. IN THAT PROJECT TO GET THE MATERIAL OUT. SO SOMETIMES THE PROJECT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CUT THE TREES DOWN. BUT A GOOD PROJECT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CUT THE TREES DOWN AND TAKE ALL THAT FOREST WASTE AND MOVE IT OUT TO A BENEFICIAL REUSE LIKE BY MASS. ABOUT IT WE WE WERE MENTIONED HERE THAT THIS WASN'T A PRICE BILL THAT WASN'T -- A RATES BILLS THAT IN FACT RATE PAYERS. BUT YOU KNOW I I'M JUST WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS APPROVED AND AT THE TIME THAT WE DID -- APPROVE -- A. B. -- EIGHT FIVE NINE THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WERE GONNA USE BIOMASS PLANTS TOO GOOD AT THE HIGHEST THREAT BECAUSE USING BIOMASS PLANTS TO HANDLE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. TREES IS JUST NOT. OF FUEL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IS JUST NOT RIGHT. I MEAN WHAT ARE WE GETTING OUT OF HERE IF. FOR TELLING PEOPLE THAT -- THINGS ARE GOING TO BE SAFE FROM THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE BY MASS IS GOING TO HANDLE IT -- I THINK WE'RE COMPLETELY MISLEADING THE PUBLIC HERE. AND AND THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE TO WEIGH. ON THE THERE'S COSTS THERE IS. THERE IS EMISSIONS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WERE FIGHT FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE. AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T -- FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WITH MORE MISSIONS. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THESE FIRES ARE VERY [inaudible] OF YOU KNOW A FULL OF THE MISSIONS. WAY MORE WAY MORE AND AND AND THE THE OF THOSE EMISSIONS. OF THE MISSIONS OF BIOMASS PALE IN COMPARISON BUT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT -- WHAT WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A FAILED POLICY OF DEALING WITH THIS THIS THIS -- THIS WASTE. SO THIS IS WHERE I AM I'M I'M HOW DO WE TO TELL PEOPLE OKAY WE'RE GONNA REDUCE THE STANDARD. SO THAT YOU CAN GET AT THE HIGH BUT IGNORE THE VERY HIGH. AND AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL TAKE WELL THAT'S FOOLISH. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? AND AND THAT'S WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW WHY WOULD WE DO THAT. IF I MIGHT CENTER -- WHAT I THINK IS HE? ONE OF THE DYNAMICS AND AND WHAT WHAT I THINK YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL. CALIFORNIANS. IS THAT THE ADMISSIBILITY SHEL DESIGNATION. FOR THE DEAD AND DYING TREES. IT WAS AN AREA IN THIS YEAR AS WHERE THERE ARE VERY FEW HOMES. THIS IS AN AREA THAT -- HIGHLY FORESTED -- A FAIR AMOUNT OF IT AND DID -- THE US FOREST LANDS -- AND NOT LANDS WHERE WE HAD TO HOMES AND PEOPLE LIVING -- THE EXTENSION. OF THE BIRAM CONTRACTS TO BE ABLE TO USE MATERIAL THAT'S IN THE HIGH HAZARD ZONE PICKS UP. THE COMMUNITIES. WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE WHILE IN URBAN INTERFACE? AND SO AND THOSE ARE VERY STRONG ARGUMENTS SO SO VERY STRONG BUT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. THE ADDRESS WRITTEN AS YOUR PROPOSED DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT. AND I'D BE WILLING TO TO AYE OKAY WITH THIS MY MY LANGUAGE MAY BE A LITTLE TOO STRICT. BUT IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GOING AFTER FUEL IN AREAS THAT ARE HIGH AND DENSELY POPULATED WAR POPULATED. VERSES OTHERS THAT ARE NOT I THINK GIVEN. THAT WE HAVE. SEVERE LIMITATIONS AND THIS IS. AGAIN I HAVE TO STRESS HOW. I MEAN YOU CAN'T VEN IDENTIFY WHETHER YOU'VE MADE A DENT. IN THIS IN THIS PROBLEM. IT WE'VE ONLY SEEN THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL GROW WITH THIS POLICY. BUT IF YOU THINK YOU COULD MAKE SOME AREAS SAY FOR USING THIS -- I'LL BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU BUT CURRENTLY THIS THIS LANGUAGE IS NOT COVER THAT ASPECT OF IT. AND WHAT I WOULD BE A FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING AT LEAST MOVING THE FAULT OF THE BILL FORWARD WITH THE AMENDMENTS STRUCK PROPOSED WAS SOME SOME WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE ONE AT LEAST CARVING OUT A SOME EXCEPTIONS SEVERAL. TARGET. HI AREAS IN IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS. IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO YOU. AND WHILE YOU THINK ABOUT IT WILL ESTABLISH A QUORUM. CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WITH SO. PRESENT WEST OF PRESENT MOORLACH BRADFORD. BRADFORD HERE CHIANG DIED. DIED HERE HERTZBERG HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO. RUBIO HERE SKINNER STERN IF STERN HERE'S DOWN. DOWN HERE WINNER. IN HERE. PUT INTO [inaudible] OUR WELCOME BACK. TO SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AT GOOD DISCUSSION AND I AND I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER NOW EXACTLY WHAT YOUR YOUR CONCERNS ARE I THINK THERE'S SOME -- HERE ARE SOME GOOD QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT'S BEEN. OUT BURNED IN THE BIOMASS FACILITIES WE CAN COME BACK WITH THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU SO WELL IT WILL TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER -- TO EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU PROPOSED AT THIS TIME AND CONTINUE WORKING ON IT -- WE THINK THERE'S A WAY THAT. WE TO GET -- TO TO YES AND WE CAN GIVE YOU INFORMATION AND MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIGHTEN IT IN A WAY THAT THAT WORKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY -- SO IT'S LIKE IT IT'S IF I COULD WE'RE GONNA NEED TO ARTICULATE THE THE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE END OF IT LEAST AN AMENDMENT THAT I HE SAW. ON ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER SO YES AND AND WE HAVE THOSE AMENDMENTS HERE IN WRITING AND I WAS. GIVEN SOME. AN AMENDMENT THAT. THE BY MISTER VERY FROM VERY HIGH ZONES. I WILL WE HAVE TO DO IS IS -- PROBABLY DO A LITTLE CARVE OUT -- FOR FOR A HIGH THREAT AREAS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS. AN INMATE AT THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS. NOT CRESCENTA CHAIRS -- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE THE AUTHOR AND THE COOPERATION IS GOING ON I'M GONNA BRING SUB THAT DISCOVER Là A LITTLE BIT OFF TOPIC BUT I JUST KIND OF WANT TO GET IT IN THE RECORD AND AND DISCUSSIONS OF IT SINCE NINE A ONE YEAH THERE WAS A PROVISION. PUT IN NINE A WIDE THAT WOULD -- REALLY ELIMINATED AGRICULTURAL WASTE FROM BEING ABLE TO BE USED IN THESE PLANTS AND THAT ALSO WASTE FROM WOODY AND WE AWAY FROM OUR YOUR FOR MORE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CERTAIN AREAS THREATENING. BIOMASS PLANTS YOUR THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT IN OTHER DISTRICTS AS WLL. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE WE ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. IT JUST [inaudible] YEAH. THOSE GOT ALL THAT STUFF INTO GOING TO THE LANDFILL. AND RIDING AND EVERYTHING THERE THE SHORT TERM CLIMATE POLLUTANTS THAT ARE BURNED ON EACH AREN'T THAT TWO COURTS BIRD ALLOWED SITE WHICH IS ARE YOU MOST DEFINITELY GOTTA COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THIS BECAUSE IT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS IT. THROUGH THE OUR BEST INTENTIONS WE HAVE BILLS AND SOMEHOW DIFFERENT LANGUAGE ENDS UP IN THE BILL THAT -- GOD KNOWS HOW IT GOT THERE BUT NEVER THE LESS -- I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS -- YEAH WILLINGNESS TO WORK HARD ON THIS ISSUE AND I HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF THIS COULD BE BROADENED TO YOU -- DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE BUT I WOULD BE ONE THAT WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. SIR BRADFORD. pTO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT SEVERAL FILE WICKS PLANTS. BIOMASS PLANTS SHOT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST HOMES SIT IDLE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE FEEDSTOCK THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE. TO HELP OUR LOAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE AND THE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT MISSION FROM THESE PLANTS HERE THE BRAND NEW ONE IN WHEAT THAT HAS. BLESSED IN PRICE SIX YEARS OLD -- WHEN HE STATED OUR PLANTS THEY BURN WAY MORE TRASH IN DENMARK AND BIO WASTE? AND IT'S NO POLLUTION AIR POLLUTION STANDARDS ARE HIGHER THAN CALIFORNIA MANY WAYS SO THE CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE MORE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHEN. IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO FORCE FIRE SO -- AND TO SAY THAT IT'S GONNA COST REPAIRED WELL FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE PROPOSING WIND AND SOLAR NO ONE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT RATE PAYERS SO I THINK THIS IS PART OF THAT DIVERSIFIED. OUR ENERGY PORTFOLIO THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MERGER. ROHANI ONE ELSE. OKAY SO WE HAVE ANY JUST WANNA MAKE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS THE ONLY CLOSE I'D LIKE TO ADD -- MR KERRY'S THAT -- I HAD TWO COUSINS THAT WERE BURNED OUT OF PARADISE THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME -- BOTH -- I HAVE TWO COUSINS THAT WERE FIREFIGHTERS THAT -- THAT THAT WENT THROUGH A LOT AND SO THE WHOLE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO PROTECT PEOPLE IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I THINK THAT'S THE REASON THAT WE PROPOSE THIS BILL. WILL GO IN AND START DOING SOME OF THE CLEARING AND AND I I WANNA -- SECOND WHAT'S BEEN SAID IN TERMS OF UTILIZING. THAT AS A OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE ENERGY AS OPPOSED TO BURNING IT OUT IN THE FIELD IS REALLY IMPORTANT. A LOT OF WE HAVE A MOTION. FROM THE MOTION. WITH A WITH A AMENDMENTS CLICK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. TO PASS AS AMENDED TO RULES COMMITTEE. WESSEL. I WAS SO I MORE LOT BRADFORD. BRADFORD I CHIANG DODD. DODD AYE HERTZBERG HILL MCGUIRE RUBIO. RUBIO EYES SKINNER STERN. STERN ICE. STONE AYE WIENER. WIENER AYE. GET OUT. OKAY FURTHER WILL HOLD THE ROLE OF THE PRESS MEMBERS THANK YOU. CENTER STERN READY YEAH. AND WHILE WHILE YOU'RE SAID ENOUGH I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC AND FOR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SB FIVE FOUR EIGHT BY SENATOR HILL HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR [inaudible] YEAH WHEN YOU'RE READY SATURDAY THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS? MORNING -- BRINGING TO YOU THIS MORNING A BILL THAT. BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY FOCUS AND ECONOMICALLY FOCUSED I THINK. WE'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVE AND BOLD IN OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AROUND THE STATE IN OUR BUILDING STANDARDS -- PATH BREAKING I WOULD SAY. BUT GOALS ARE NOTHING IF YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE. ON THE PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN FACING. IS THAT IN THE WORLD OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. THE WORK ITSELF TO INSTALL THE THE LIGHTING CONTROLS AIR CONDITIONING UNITS HEATING SYSTEMS. HAS NOT BEEN UP TO SNUFF ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY GUARANTEE THAT WE'RE ACHIEVING EFFICIENCY REDUCTIONS WE'RE SHOOTING FOR ENTITLED TWENTY FOUR AND FRANKLY THAT WERE ACHIEVING OUR SCOPING PLANNED. REDUCTIONS THAT A BROADER LEVEL WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE POLICY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TONS ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERED. AND IT. THAT THESE MEASURES HAVE SOME TEETH SO THE GOAL HERE TODAY THOUGH IS TO PROVIDE. A EXPERIENCE SKILLED WORK FORCE TO ACTUALLY DO THESE PROJECTS RIGHT WHEN THEY COME FROM PVC BASED INCENTIVES THIS IS NOT INTENDED -- TO PUT IT PUT A FOOT PRINT ON THE ENTIRE MARKET PLACE THIS IS ABOUT A CERTAIN CLASS OF PROJECTS LARGELY COMMERCIAL PROJECTS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE THRESHOLD IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL. BUT THE GOAL HERE IS TO TRY TO GET SKILLED EXPERIENCED WORKERS DOING. LARGE SCALE ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. EFFICIENCY RESULTS WE ONCE THE SAVINGS RATE PAYERS THAT WE WANT AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WE WANT AND BY THE WAY PROVIDE A PATHWAY. FOR FOLKS WHO ACTUALLY NEED DURABLE WORK. FAMILY SUPPORTING WAGES TO ACTUALLY MAE CALIFORNIA. MORE LIVABLE PLACE SO WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOREVER. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH WE HAVE THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS IN THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. WE A CO SPONSOR THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE AFTER YEARS OF PETITIONING THE PVC TO DO WORK FOR STANDARDS -- THEY JUST HAVE TURNED A BLIND DIE. DESPITE THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS -- THE SEEP CPUC ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS ALONE STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND. THAT ACTUAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS FROM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. OR AS LITTLE AS 51%. OF THE EXPECTED SAVINGS WITH THEIR EVALUATED POST INSTALLATION. FOR EXAMPLE POLL POOR QUALITY INSTALLATION OF EIGHT TRACK SYSTEMS HAS BEEN FOUND TO RESULT IN THE 2240% INCREASE IN ENERGY USE. THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOUND THAT UP 285% OF EIGHT TRACK SYSTEMS ARE INSTALLED INCORRECTLY 85% OR INSTALLED INCORRECTLY. AND THEY FOUND IN REGARDS TO AUTOMATIC DAYLIGHTING CONTROLS. THAT THOSE FAILED TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED IN SEVEN OUT OF SEVEN TESTS. IN THE OCCUPANCY SENSORS THE OTHER MAJOR ADVANCED LIGHTING CONTROL FAILED TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED IN TWO OUT OF THREE TESTS. OTHER STUDIES FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE WORKFORCE PERFORMING THIS WORK HAD NO. FORMAL TRAINING WHATSOEVER SO WITH THIS BILL PURPORTS TO DO IS TO ADD THE SAME SKILLED IN TRADE WORK FOR STANDARDS THAT WERE REQUIRED FOR SCHOOL WORK THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORK -- BEST VALUE WORK IT TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND OTHER PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS AS WELL AS REFINERIES [inaudible] AND THE TO DO SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DOES THE LABOR COMMITTEE AND AREN'T FAMILIAR SKILLED AND TRAINED. IT REQUIRES THAT BY. TWENTY TWENTY THE CONTRACTORS PERFORMING LARGER SCALE COMMERCIAL SIZE WORK OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE. HAVE 60% OF THEIR WORK FORCE EITHER HAVING GRADUATED FROM A STATE APPROVED UNION OR NONUNION APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. OR THAT THEIR WORKERS SUGGEST HAVE N EQUIVALENT WORK EXPERIENCE MEETING THAT THEY HAVE WORKED THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOURS THAT ONE WOULD NEED TO WORK ON THE JOB IN ORDER TO GRADUATE FROM A UNION OR NONUNION PRETTY SHOULD PROGRAM. THIS IS NOT A UNION OR NONUNION BILL THIS IS A BILL TRYING TO ENSURE THAT IF WE'RE GONNA SINK ALL THIS REPAIR MONEY A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO ALL OF THIS WORK. THAT IS ACTUALLY PERFORMED BY EXPERIENCED WORKERS. SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO ACHIEVE -- THERE IS WE SAW A LATE OPPOSITION YESTERDAY'S A COUPLE RECOMMENDED -- AMENDMENTS THAT THEY WERE PURSUING. THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE AUTHOR -- WORK WITH THEM RELATIVE TO HOW THE P. YOU SEE CALCULATES THEIR COST. RAM ANDERS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND WE AGREED AND WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT POINT. BUT THEN THEY ALSO SUGGESTED WE SHOULD GIVE EQUIVALENCY. ARE TWO SKILLED AND TRAINED TO WORKERS WHO COME FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND WHY THAT IS -- A PARTICULAR PROGRAMS WITHIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WHY -- THAT AMENDMENT ISN'T IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN IS NOT NECESSARY. IS THAT FIRST OF ALL FOR THE MOST PART WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TOTALLY UNREGULATED PROGRAMS AND WHAT AND SO THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THAT IS AT HAND. AND SECONDLY THAT LAST CONDITION ALREADY APPLIES TO THOSE PROGRAMS IT'S IT YOU CAN COME FROM PROGRAMS THAT EXIST AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS LONG AS YOU JUST HAVE THE SAME WORK EXPERIENCE THE SAME NUMBER OF HOURS. AS SOMEBODY FROM. THE SHIP PROGRAM SO WITH THAT WE'D URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING COMMENTS FLOOR ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL SHEET METAL WORKERS ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL ARE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR OF PRISONS ARE SCOTTISH MENTIONED. I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS OF FIRST OF ALL THIS THIS BILL IS -- ONLY APPLIES TO THE TOP 1% OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SENATE STATE UTILITIES CARE OF 99% OF THE PROGRAM TO SMALLER PROGRAMS. AREN'T AFFECTED BUT FOR PROGRAMS WHERE RATE PER TO PUTTING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TWO VERY LARGE PROJECTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROJECTS. ARE DONE CORRECTLY AND ARE ACHIEVING THE SAVINGS. A MAXIMIZING THE SAVINGS THEY CAN ACHIEVE ARM. THERE ARE WESTERN STATES IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE COALITION FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITH THE COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION EDUCATIONAL LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS COULD IN BLUE GREEN ALLIANCE HERE CLUB AND OTHERS. THAT HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO FIND CONSENSUS SOLUTIONS FOR FORCE ISSUES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THE LONG SUPPORTED A I WAS GOING TRAINED WORK FORCE -- REQUIREMENT FOR A VERY LARGE INCENTIVES AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS FOR MEMBER WORK WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PARTNERS ON THIS IS BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE STANDARDS SUPPORT THIS ADVANCE WORKERS. BECAUSE THEY INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR APPRENTICES AND PURCHASE A PROGRAMS ARE THE PRIMARY PATHWAY FOR PROVIDING DISADVANTAGED WORKERS GOOD PAYING CONSTRUCTION CAREER OPPORTUNITIES -- THAT CAN SURVIVE CHANGES IN IN THE INDUSTRY AND AND THEY ALSO REDUCE WEIGHT TO BENEFIT INEQUITIES THAT OUR THEIR WIDESPREAD IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. MR PROGRAMS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE BUT THEY DON'T WORK WITHOUT APPRENTICESHIP OPENINGS AND SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING THE TYPE OF CONTRACTORS. THAT ARE PROVIDE ACCESS TO DISBAND WORKERS SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT SURE MEMBERS THIS IDEAS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT I JUST WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING ON THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP MODEL. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY ADDRESSESPRE APPRENTICESHIP TARGETING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND GROUPS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS AND UNIONS. THAT THERE IS A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THESE REWARDING JOBS AND CAREERS IN THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED TO ALL THE CAREERS THAT ACTUALLY ARE HIGH WAGE AND THAT REQUIRE RIGOROUS TRAINING BECAUSE THIS JOB. THESE JOBS DO REQUIRE HIGH SKILLS INTO WHETHER THE USER STAND STRONG SUPPORT. US BECAUSE IN OPPOSITION IF WE CAN -- RATIONS BASE A ONE FOR A LONG COMMON TO HAVE A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THIS BILL. MIKE MONICA WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE PATRIOTS COUNCIL A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ERRANI MILA REPRESENTING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL REGRETTABLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED TODAY -- WE ACTUALLY DON'T TAKE ISSUE WITH THE CONCEPT OF SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE AT ALL -- WE TAKE ISSUE. WITH THE ISSUE THAT MISTER WEST ALSO ADDRESSED IN HIS TESTIMONY WHICH IS -- THAT THE P. YOU SEE HAS A VERY ANTIQUATED DE FACTO COST CAP. ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS IN A WAY THAT IT WORKS BASICALLY IS -- THAT THEY HAVE SET A STANDARD WHICH DOES NOT COUNT PRIVATE MONEY OR ACTUALLY COUNTS PRIVATE MONEY AGAINST THE PROJECT. ACCOUNTS EIGHT EIGHT COUNTS PRIVATE MONEY AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT. AS A FORM OF REPAIR FUNDS AND IN DOING THAT BASICALLY THEY HAVE. CREATED A SYSTEM IN WHICH THESE PROJECTS LOOK LIKE THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO THE RATE PAYER THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE AND THAT'S COUNTED AGAINST THE PROJECT SECOND THING IS. THEY NEVER -- US YET COMPARE ENERGY EFFICIENCY TO THE COST OF PROCUREMENT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY ANTITHETICAL SINCE IN MANY CASES IT ACTUALLY COMES OUT CHEAPER. AND THEN THE THIRD THING IS -- THAT THEY ACTUALLY LOOK AT AT DO A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE CUSTOMER TO DETERMINE. WHETHER THE CUSTOMER WOULD HAVE MADE THE IMPROVEMENT ANYWAY AND THEY USE THAT TO DISCOUNT THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE PROJECT. SO ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS SORT OF ANTIQUATED WAY OF LOOKING AT ENERGY EFFICIENCY NOT ALLOWING IT TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER RESOURCES. IS HOLDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY BACK MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PAY THE WAGES THAT ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS WANT TO PAY. AND SO WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING -- AS TIME MOVES ON TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- WITH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS WE HAD WE'VE HAD SOME VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SB THREE FIFTY AS YOU ALL KNOW. ANTICIPATED THE DOUBLING OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOALS ENERGY EFFICIENCY COMPANY SINCE THEN HAVE LEFT THE STATE AND SO HAS SOME OF THE WORK FORCE THAT WE RELY ON AS A RESULT OF THESE ANTIQUATED P. YOU SEE PROCESSES. AND SO WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS FOR HAVING THESE VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE -- AND WE APPRECIATE THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE SOME CLEAR FINE CHAIN OF AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED YES SO THANK YOU I I WANT TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. AND I ALSO I MEANT TO CLARIFY IN MY OPENING ALTHOUGH I THINK YOU HEARD IT FROM -- OUR SUPPORTERS THAT -- THE CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THAT CURRENT METHODOLOGY AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION I BIND TO BE COMPELLING AND MEAN. THE GOAL SHOULD BE. TO GET MORE THROUGHPUT AND EFFICIENCY PROJECTS WRIT LARGE IN THE STATES OF THAT'S HOLDING US BACK FROM ACTUALLY GETTING. GROWING THE PIE IN MEETING THAT DOUBLING TARGET I'M OPEN TO THAT TOO SO IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU SEE EXCEPT THAT BUT ALSO COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH. OUR FOLKS IN THE EFFICIENCY DEMAND COUNCIL -- YET COMPARED ACOSTA PROCUREMENT EXCLUDING PARTISAN ACROSS IN THESE CONCEPTS THEY RAISE THEIR NEW SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT BUT I'M OPEN. TO WHAT WHY. WIFE OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD IS SAD. IS THAT JUST RANDOM ISN'T BASED ON SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR THAT CAME OUT OF A ROSS SAYS WITH THAT LARGER COALITION THAT WAS REFERENCE TO CHAIRMAN WITH THE THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND SOME THEM -- ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS. AND SAVE ME SOME KIND OF AN EGG ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE OF OF A OF A PROJECT AND WHAT ARE YOUR USUAL WHO WAITED WHERE IT USUALLY COSTS WOULD YOU GET FOR FIFTY THOUSAND YET WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT HERE FIFTY FIFTY THOUSAND ZERO GRAHAM THAT IS. SUPPORTED BY THE THE P. UC'S PROGRAM. SO. CHECK THIS PLACE. AS SOON AS CHAIRMAN -- TWO GOOD EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE A MEDIUM SIZE MAYBE THREE STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDING THAT NEEDS. NEW HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM AND A NEW COOLING TOWER WHICH ARE TWO HUGE ENERGY USERS. I KNOW THE ADEQUATE AND OUTDATED. CERTAINLY THE FIFTY THOUSAND ONE PAY FOR ALL THAT WORK BUT IT WOULD IT BE YOU KNOW -- A REBATE THAT WOULD ALLOW A PROJECT HONORED WILL MOVE FORWARD ON DOING THAT TYPE OF WORK. OR IT MIGHT BE GOING INTO A MEDIUM SIZE COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND REPLACE REPLACING ALL OF THE LIGHTING FIXTURES. TO HIGH EFFICIENCY LIGHT FIXTURES AS WELL AS IN INSTALLING -- ADVANCED LIGHTING SO THE REBATE WOULD BE APPLIED TO THE FIFTY THOUSAND COST OR WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE THE REBATE ITSELF THE THRESHOLD IS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR. SUCH A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR REBATE OR MORE YEAH OKAY SO IT APPLIES TO THE PRINT NOT THE PROJECT COSTS BUT THE REBATE COST [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY ANY ANYTHING ELSE ARTS CENTER WIENER. THANK YOU UNDER SECURE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR BEING FORWARD A ONE THING I KNOW I REYES IF YOU IN WITH THIS TO WATCH AS WELL AS THE WANTING TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS NOT. INTENDED TO APPLY TO DVRS SOLAR. I KNOW THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING AROUND THOSE ISSUES NOT TO SEPARATE. A DISCUSSION I KNOW YOU MIGHT THINK YOU WANT TO BE A MOMENT TO TALK CLARIFIES OUT BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONTINUING CONCERNS AROUND SOLAR THERMAL. AND SO -- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE. CLEARLY REFLECTS WHAT I KNOW YOUR INTENT IS SO CAN YOU CALL YEAH NO THANK YOU -- YEAH THE GOAL WAS TO TRY TO REFINE THE DEFINITION TO SOMEWHERE -- MORE NEAR WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY HERE THAT'S THE SCOPE -- SO IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER REFINEMENTS NEEDED. THE COMMITTEE STAFF DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB TODAY BUT YEAH THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT. THE SORT OF EFFICIENCY THERE'S THERE'S A SPECIFIC KIND OF PRETTY GOOD JOB YOU WANT US TO A BETTER JOB. YEAH WE KNOW BETTER JOB. YOUR BILL. A GREAT JOB. YEAH I'LL JUST JUST CLOSE MY MOUTH AND SAY. YES. ABOUT THAT FOR YOU BUT THEY'LL BE CONTINUING AS DIALOGUE YES THANK YOU I'M SAYING. THANK YOU SENATOR. CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND NO DOUBT WE WE WANT TO SKILLED WORKFORCE ARE IN PLACE. TO DO THIS ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORK BUT I GUESS MY CHALLENGES WHEN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY REFERRING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE ONLY REASON THEIR DISADVANTAGES THAT THERE NEVER GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY IT'S NOT THERE. THAT THEY LACK THE SKILLS SAID IN MANY CASES THERE THIS NEVER GIVEN OPPORTUNITY SO THAT'S WHY THESE CONTINUE TO STATE. DISADVANTAGE WHAT WILL BE THE OUT REACH TO REALLY TAP INTO THIS WORKFORCE BECAUSE WE CONSCIOUSLY TALK ABOUT. DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT EVERY TIME WHEN I LOOK AT THESE PROJECTS. NOT A MORE ON THE WORK SITE HOW DO WEEKS REALLY EXPANDED IN AND HIT THE TARGET. CENTER BRADFORD SCOTT WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE TO KILL THREE COLORS UTILITY EMPLOYEES AND THE I. B. W. UP FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL AFFECTS THE SET ASIDE MANDATE I THINK THAT YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF THAT REQUIRES A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ALL. CONTRACTS TO GO TO MINORITY AND WOMEN AND DISABLED VETERAN OWNED BUSINESSES -- IN ADDITION THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT. MY COLLEAGUES HIS IDEAS REFERENCE REGARDING -- PROVIDING THE RESOURCES TO EXPAND AND CREATE MORE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. IS REALLY KICKING IN YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LARGEST ONES AT ELLIE TRADE TECH. WHERE -- THEY'RE DOING EXTRA GREAT WORK THERE -- WE'RE HOPING TO EXPAND THAT BELIEVE ME WE NEED MORE WORKERS -- NOT. WE HAVE ADEQUATE WORK FORCES TODAY BUT WE DO HAVE AN AGING WORKFORCE IN SO THOSE PRE PENSION PROGRAMS ARE REALLY GOING TO BE WHAT FEEDS ARE PRETTY SHOULD PROGRAMS. GOING FORWARD. THE FOR AS FOR BECAUSE ARE SKILLED AND TRAINED LANGUAGE ALLOWS AN EQUIVALENCY. FOR WORKERS ARE HAVING GONE THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM BUT HAVE JUST BEEN HIRED BY BY A CONTRACTORS. AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE PREREQUISITE NUMBER OF HOURS -- THAT'S REALLY WITH A BIG BURDEN IS BECAUSE THE THE UNION SECTORS INVESTING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TRAINING AND WE ARE RECRUITING FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IT IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONTRACTORS WHO ARE NONUNION -- WHO ARE INVESTING A DIME IN TRAINING PROGRAMS AND -- I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD TO FOCUS SOME SOME ATTENTION AND DO SOME GOOD. RIGHT CAN I JUST ASK WHO ARE YOU SEE THE GREATEST DIVERSITY. AND NON UNION [inaudible] CONTRACTORS. IT IT IT DEPENDS REGION FROM REGION. AND I CAN I JUST ADD ON THOUGH I DON'T WANT TO OVER PROMISE WITH THIS BILL SENATOR BRADFORD I DO NOT THINK THIS BILL IS GOING TO SOLVE THE GAP. I I I THINK I THINK YOU'RE POINTING IN YOUR LEADERSHIP FOR US ALL BACK IN THE ASSEMBLY AND GET THE P. YOU SEE ON TRACK AND GENERAL CONTRACTING IS STILL. CREATING MEANINGFUL PASS OUT OF POVERTY TO THIS DAY BUT THIS. THIS PROGRAM ON ITS OWN I DON'T THINK IS ENOUGH TO DRIVE I THINK WE GOT TO DO MORE. THINGS LIKE THERE'S A THERE'S TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN G. G. OR F. PROPOSES YOU'RE ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GOING TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND PUSHING SOMEBODY'S APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WORKING WITH FOLKS LIKE ARCHITRAVE TECH LA. FOR THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO MORE I GUESS IS MY POINT SO ANYA THANK YOU YEAH. ANYONE ELSE A SUNROOF JUST A QUICK COMMNT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION I'M JUST NOT QUITE SURE YOU OF ANSWERED MISTER BRADFORD QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE OUT REACH I KNOW. ELLIE TRACK TRADE TACK YOUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE WHAT ARE YOU DOING FURTHER TO GO DEEPER AND I'M THINKING MORE IN ARE YOU REACHING OUT TO YOU KNOW HIGH SCHOOLS SCHOOLS. I'M NOT SURE YOU'VE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION SPECIFICALLY CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT SURE -- WE DO DO THAT SO THE WAY THAT A PRETTY SHIP WORKS. IS -- THERE IS A VERY SMALL PART OF MONEY THAT THE STATE PROVIDES CALLED MONTOYA DOLLARS AND FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF MINE TôI AT FUNDS THAT ARE SPENT ON A PRETTY SHIP IN PRE OF FRIENDSHIP. OUR UNION EMPLOYERS AND OUR UNION SPEND ABOUT TEN DOLLARS AND SO WOULD LITERALLY EACH AND EVERY YEAR. WE'RE SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT RATHER THAN GOING ON TO THE PAYCHECK. OF THE WORKERS. GETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE POT TO GO AND GROW THE WORK FORCE AND SO WE'RE GOING WE HAVE OUTREACH PROGRAMS. TO EX MILITARY WE HAVE AGGRESSIVE CALLED HELMETS TO HARD HATS -- WE HAVE -- A GOOD PROGRAM THAT THE SENATOR REFERENCED GOING AFTER -- THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. WE'RE GOING INTO -- HIGH SCHOOLS I MEAN WE ARE EXPANDING RIGHT NOW IN MY TWENTY SOME YEARS WE HAVE NEVER HAD MORE APPRENTICES IN THE PIPELINE AND WE DO TODAY. AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE NEVER HAD AS MANY FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDING BUT BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE PROLIFERATION OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN MOST MAJOR PRO PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR INSTANCE THE PROJECT STABILIZATION AGREEMENT WITH. LA UST. HAS A REQUIREMENTS THAT WE GO OUT AND HIRE -- FOLKS CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO -- WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING THAT. THANK YOU THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION PRECIADO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF CENTER STONE YEAH THANK YOU MISTER WHICH OF MISTER MISTER AND MISTER WHICH THE H. FACT INSTALLATIONS ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT IN MY DISTRICT FOR GETS TO BE A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO DEGREES. IN THE SUMMERTIME -- STATEWIDE WHAT IS WHAT WOULD YOU SAY WITH THE PRINT THE PERCENTAGE OF H. BACK INSTALLERS WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT UP AND THROUGH AN APPROVED PRINCIPAUX GRAHAM THROUGH -- YOUR YOUR YOUR SOURCES. WELL BECAUSE AT THE CENTER I THANK YOU THAT THE A PRETTY SURE PROGRAMS OF COURSE OF COURSE ARE. COVERED -- UNION AND NONUNION EMPLOYERS SO CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN THE SHEET METAL WORKERS AND THE UNITED CESSATION OF PLUMBERS AND FIGHT AND PIPEFITTERS WHO BOTH DO THAT WORK. WE PROBABLYHAVE AROUND -- I WOULD SAY WITH THE NON UNION YOU COULD PROBABLY ADD ANOTHER -- YEAH YOU COULD PROBABLY ADD ANOTHER. AT LEAST THAT NUMBER I MEAN PROBABLY IT YEAHTHEY'RE STILL THE WORK FIRST MAYBE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THOUSAND SO BETWEEN. THE UNION IN THE NON YOU WORKFORCE I WOULD SAY IT'S UPWARDS OF SIXTY THOUSAND AND THEN. THE SECONDARY -- PROVISION REQUIREMENT IS IS IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM OR AREN'T CURRENTLY IN INFORMATION PROGRAM. IF YOU HAVE THE EQUIVALENT WORKERS -- THE EQUIVALENT WORKING HOURS IN THE INDUSTRY. ABOUT TWO THOUSAND I BELIEVE IS THE THAT WOULD BE A THE APPROPRIATE FIGURE. THEN THERE'S YOU KNOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE OF COURSE AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW PROBABLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE FOLKS WORKING IN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW. PROBABLY HAVE THAT HAVE THAT TO WORKING CLOSELY SEE FOR THE BRITISH OKAY SO YOU SAY ABOUT I AM NOT DE. I'M I'M GUESSING AT MY EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE CONTRACTORS COULD BE HERE. TO THE HEARING BUT THEY COULD BARELY SPEAK TO WORK MORE CLOSELY BUT CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW ALL OF THE HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING CONTRACTORS IN YOUR AREA THAT BEEN AROUND FOR A VERY LONG TIME PROBABLY MANY OF THEM NON UNION. THEIR WORKFORCE HOW TRANSITORY IS IT THEY PROBABLY HAVE A WORK FORCE TO BE SUS REQUIRE BRIDGES BY THE ON JOB ON THE JOB EXPERIENCE OKAY BUT YOU SAY ABOUT 50% PROBABLY ARE OF THE POPULATION THAT YOU REPRESENT. WE OWE IT I KNOW I SAID AS I SAID WE HAVE PROBABLY ABOUT. SIXTY THOUSAND IN THE WORK FORCE OKAY. OUT OF HOW MANY IN THE WORK FORCE. WOULD YOU SAY I AND I HAVE THIS FOR YEARS AND FOR ME SENATOR BUT HI I WOULD BE MORE THAN WILLING TO GO ON A LIMB HERE AND SAY THAT. THAT AT LEAST 40% OF THE TOTAL WORKFORCE DOING HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS HAS EITHER GRADUATED FROM STATE APPROVED A PRESSURE PROGRAM OR HAS THE EQUIVALENT HOURS WHICH WOULD BE. IN THE YOU KNOW OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES EVERYTHING OKAY I APPRECIATE ALL THE SO THAT'S A REFLECTION NOT ONLYON OUR YOUR FRIENDSHIP PROGRAMS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSEDLY TRAINED -- SO SO WE HAVE A PROBLEM NOT ONLY. IN -- NONUNION APPRENTICESHIPS BUT IN IN IN FRIENDSHIPS AS WELL -- WHICH IS BECAUSE AT ILLUSTRATIVE OF WHAT. THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY CRACKED OKAY BECAUSE WHAT WE WE WE ALSO ALL OF OUR CONTRACTORS HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED BY NATIONAL. THIRD PARTY ACCREDITATION AS ACCEPTS ACCEPTANCE TESTERS. ACCEPTANCE ACCEPTANCE TESTERS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO GO IN COMMISSION BUILDINGS AFTER AN H. FAX SYSTEM IS INSTALLED. SO FOR THE SEGMENT OF THE H. FAQ SYSTEMS THAT WE INSTALL. THE 85% FIGURE IS THE THE NUMBER OF EIGHT TRACK SYSTEMS INSTALLED THROUGH ONE OF THESE REBATE PROGRAMS NOT OUT THERE IN GENERAL SO NO THAT THAT THAT'S IT IS NOT CORRECT APPRECIATE THAT. SO MUCH MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE -- MANY RURAL AREAS -- DESERT CENTER -- POLITE AREA -- WHERE? ARE YOU DON'T THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET SOMEBODY HAS BEEN APPROVED OR A STATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM -- AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT'S KIND OF A LITMUS TEST OF OF THIS BILL IS THAT IF YOU ARE. GRADUATING FROM STATE APPROVED PRINTER PROGRAM NOT WHETHER NOT YOUR SKILLED AND TRAINED IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK. MY MISSING SOMETHING YOU ARE SENATOR BUT THINGS BUT AGAIN I'LL JUST REPEAT WHAT I SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS HERE TO BEING SKILLED AND TRAINED. ONE IS THAT YOU'VE GRADUATED FROM A STATE APPROVED UNION OR NONUNION FRIENDSHIP PROGRAM AND THERE'S A NON UNION A PRINTER PROGRAM SERVING YOUR DISTRICT RIGHT. OR YOU'RE A JOURNEY PERSON THAT HAS THE EQUIVALENT WORK EXPERIENCE SO IN LESS EVERY AGE FAQ INSTALLER YOUR DISTRICT JUST MOVED TO CALIFORNIA OR JUST PICKED UP THE TRADE. THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN YOUR DISTRICT. THANKS FOR VERIFICATION. CENTER CAN I JUST ADD CLOSING COMMENTS YA ALL WRAPPED IN MY CLOTHES -- ICING IS A REALLY HEALTHY DISCUSSION BETWEEN SAYS RUBIO BRADFORD AND STONE TODAY JUST IN TERMS OF LET'S GET A SENSE OF THE BROADER JOBS PICTURE HERE. WE'RE GOING AFTER ONE SLICE OF PROJECT BUT THERE IS A BROADER NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY JOBS SPACE IF YOU'RE HAVING GROW THAT POT WE WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER JUDGE IF YOU WANT. TO INCREASE AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO THE ROUGH DATA FOR YOU OUT OF IT AB. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT FOR ADVANCED ENERGY ECONOMY IS THAT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND WORKERS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WORKED IN BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY WRIT LARGE. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SLICE OF VERY HIGHLY SKILLED AND TRAINED AND EXPERIENCED WORKERS DOING. SIRIUS LARGE SCALE PROJECTS THAT THAT PERSON Sí YOUR HOUSE OR YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR FAMILY'S HOUSE -- IS NOT REALLY THE TARGET THIS BILL BUT I THINK. THERE IS A BROADER NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND AND TO REALLY GET THE NUMBERS RIGHT AND FIGURE OUT WHAT OUTCOMES WE WANT TO SEE AND IF WE'RE GETTING THE FOLKS. IN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THOSE WHO NEED A SECOND SHOT AT LIFE SO I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THAT WITH YOU AS WE AS WE MOVE THIS BILL LONG ANSWER TO GETTING THE DATA RIGHT SO WE CAN SCOPE THE PROBLEM -- BUT I I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK FOR THE DISCUSSION. VERY WELL OF TO HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION WITH AMENDMENTS. AND YOU ACCEPT ALL THE AMENDMENTS. A CLERK PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DO YOU PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WEST SO.

THANK YOU TO HIS COMMITTEE TEAM FOR THEIR WORK ON SB -- SIX SEVENTY OVER THESE PAST MANY MONTHS. UNDER TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT SB. SIX SEVENTY RELATED TO NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY LEARNING CAPABILITY. AN OUTAGE NOTIFICATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK AGAIN THE CHAIR FOR THE WORK I AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATORS DODD AND STERN FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP. UNDER PERCENT PARTNERSHIP ON THIS LEGISLATION. THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTH A CHANGE THE LIVES OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS FOREVER. WHETHER YOU'RE ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND EVACUATED IN THE NORTH BAY AREA. ONE OF THE SIX THOUSAND WHO LOST THEIR HOME. ONE OF THE THOUSANDS WHO FLED IN THE MIDDLE A NIGHT THROUGH THE FLAMES. BUT ONE OF THE DOZENS WHO LOST A LOVED ONE DUE TO THE FIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE LAW SHOULD NOT KNOWING BAY. IMAGINE BEING IN A LIFE THREATENING EMERGENY PICKING UP YOUR PHONE TO CALL 911- AND HAVING NO SERVICE OR DIAL TONE. OR BEING DEAD ASLEEP IN NEVER RECEIVING EMERGENCY ALERT. TO LET YOU KNOW THAT FLAMES HER CLOAK CLOSING IN IN. THERE ABOUT TO ENGULF YOUR HOME. UNFORTUNATELY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FACED WITH THIS REALITY SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR NOW. AND THESE REAL WORLD SCENARIOS ARE INCREASING TO THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF CALIFORNIA'S WILDFIRES. AN EMERGENCY OR CATASTROPHIC SITUATION LACK OF ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE PUBLIC ALERTS AND WARNINGS PUT LIVES AT RISK. SB SIX SEVENTY IS A SIMPLE STEP TO MITIGATE THE RISKS DURING TIMES OF A TOTAL CRISIS -- IN PHONE OUTAGES BY REQUIRING TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO REPORT NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGES OR OUTAGES AFFECTING EMERGENCY ALERT IN MORNING TECHNOLOGIES TO THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN REAL TIME. IT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD ALREADY BE HAPPENING. BUT IT'S NOT. IT'S COMMONSENSE APPROACH WILL ENSURE COORDINATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS AND TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES. SB SIX SEVENTY WILL PROVIDE EMERGENCY OFFICIALS WITH REAL TIME DATA IN THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. SO THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL THRESHOLDS THE FEDERAL TELECOMMUNICATION -- COMMISSION FCC ONLY REQUIRES REPORTING OUTAGES THAT LAST THIRTY MINUTES AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND USER MINUTES. UNDER THIS THRESHOLD IT WOULD TAKE TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AN OUTAGE THAT LAST NINETY MINUTES. BEFORE THE THRESHOLD TO REPORTING TO THE F. C. C.'S HIT AND THEN PROVIDERS ARE GIVEN ANOTHER HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES TO NOTIFY THE FCC. AND WHILE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND FCC HAVE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE ALL COMPONENTS AND I'M WILLING SERVICE. OUTAGE REPORTING TO THE VIEW SEIZE PROVIDED HOURS. IF NOT SOMETIMES DAYS AFTER THE ACTUAL. OUTAGE OCCURS NOT REAL TIME. I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES OF TWO MASSIVE FIRES IN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. DURING THE CAMPFIRE. WHICH BEGAN AROUND SIX THIRTY THREE AM. ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE CPC RECEIVE THEIR NOTIFICATION OF THE OUTAGE. THAT IMPACTED THE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BUTTE COUNTY. FROM THE FCC. OVER FIVE HOURS LATER. AT TWELVE OH ONE PM. AFTER THOUSANDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. IN LIVES LOST. THE TUBS FIRE IN SANTA ROSA BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY NINE FORTY THREE PM ON OCTOBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN THE CPC RECEIVE THEIR FIRST CERTIFICATION FROM THE FCC OVER SIX HOURS LATER AT FOUR TWELVE AM. THE NEXT MORNING. THOUSANDS OF HOMES IN THAT TIME HAD BEEN DESTROYED. AND BY THAT TIME THE TUBS FIRE HAD BURNED INTO CENTRAL ST SANTA ROSA. IN TAKING DOWN ALL OF COFFEE PARK. THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES NEVER RECEIVED FORMAL NOTIFICATION IN THE SENTENCES. IS REPORTING CAME TOO LATE. AND IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. CURRENTLY ONE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES GO DOWN AFFECTING NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OR THE ABILITY FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO SEND EMERGENCY ALERTS TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT REAL TIME INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE OUTAGE HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE AFFECTED. IN WHEN THE ESTIMATED TIME FOR REPAIR IS. CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION DURING TIMES OF DISASTER. FAILURE TO REPORT OUTAGES AFFECTING NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OR EMERGENCY ALERTING CAPABILITIES CAN WREAK HAVOC ON COMMUNITIES AND PUTS THE PUBLIC SAFETY AT RISK WHAT YOU HEAR FROM BOTH THE SHERIFF. AS WELL AS THE FIRE CHIEF TODAY. SB SIX SEVENTY WOULD REQUIRE PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION THE CAL O. YES WHETHER THERE IS A NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGE OR ANY OUTAGE AFFECTING EMERGENCY WARNING CAPABILITIES WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES. OF THE OUTAGE OCCURRING CALORIE S. WITHIN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOTIFYING THE AFFECTED LOCAL COUNTY -- YES WHICH WOULD THEN WORK WITH OBVIOUSLY THE SHERIFF IN THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IS TO ENSURE ALL THE NECESSARY EMERGENCY OFFICIALS ARE GIVEN THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE. TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY CALLOW YES WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES OF THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF OUTAGES WITH SOME COMMONSENSE DATA POINTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE ESTIMATED AREA AFFECTED THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AFFECTED THE ESTIMATED TIME TO RESTORE THE OUTAGE AND A CONTACT PERSON THAT CAO YES CAN REACH. UP FOR FURTHER UPDATES VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE ALREADY SEE WITH POWER OUTAGES IN THE STATE. ONCE THE NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY ALERTING CAPABILITY OURS HAS BEEN RESTORED THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDER WOULD ALSO NEED TO NOTIFY CAL WE ASK THAT RESTORATION OF SERVICE HAS OCCURRED -- I WILL END IT RIGHT HERE MISTER CHAIR I SIX SEVENTY ONE SURE THAT OUR STATE LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS RESPOND HERS AT THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO RESPOND WHEN THOSE EXTRA MINUTES. COULD SAVE LIVES MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY -- WE HAVE TODAY TONY GOZER FIRE CHIEF OF THE CITY SANTA ROSA. CITY SANTA ROSA THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEF AND PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS SUPPORT THIS BILL WE ALSO MARK ESSEX SHARE FOR CINEMA COUNTY THE CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION. IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT PLEASE PROCEED HEY THERE YOU GO [inaudible] YEAH. BOB GOOD MORNING CHURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS TONY GUYS FROM THE FIRE CHIEF FOR THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA. THE RECENT FIRES IN CINEMA NAPA INVENTOR COUNTY AND I SAY RECENT AS TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN A A NUMBER OF OTHER CATASTROPHIC. CATASTROPHIC FIRES. HAVEN'T BEEN AMONG AMONG THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN STATE HISTORY. THE DISASTERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE A MERCY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED. BOTH FOR RESIDENTS AND FIRST RESPONDERS. ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT THE WHEN THE TUBS FIRE STARTED AT NINE FORTY THREE ON SUNDAY NIGHT IT TOOK FOUR HOURS. I BURN TWELVE MILES TO GET TO THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA AND ENTERED THE CITY AT ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING -- AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT SANTA ROSA ON ITS OWN FRONT -- BETWEEN SIX PM AND TWELVE AM THAT NIGHT HAD TEN REPORTED STRUCTURE FIRE SOME TWENTY REPORTER VEGETATION FIRES. BEFORE THE TUBS FIRE EVEN CAME INTO THE CITY. SO WE AS THE FIRE SERVICE WAS ALREADY VERY BUSY -- DEALING WITH OUR OWN LOCAL EMERGENCIES. REMINDED TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE DIED DURING THIS TIME -- BY SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING MOST OF THE DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE -- YOU KNOW THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA LOST OVER THREE THOUSAND HOMES -- THE CITY AND THE COUNTY TOGETHER LOST OVER SIX THOUSAND HOMES. AND THAT'S JUST THE FIRES IN CINEMA COUNTY WE ALSO THE ALICE PEAK FIRE THAT LOST MEMBER OF HOMES AS WELL AS LIVES WE HAD TO REDWOOD. VALLEY FIRE THAT ALSO LOS NUMBER OF HOMES AND LIVES. A SOURCE NOT JUST IN ON THE COUNTY THIS IS REALLY A STATEWIDE ISSUE AND WHAT THE WAY THE FIRES ARE BURNING IN TODAY'S WORLD. THEY'RE BURNING MUCH FASTER MUCH MORE TENSE AND MOVING OUT WITH MUCH MORE PURPOSE. SB SIX SEVENTY WOULD REQUIRE PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO NOTIFY CAL -- YES WHENEVER THERE'S A NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGE OR ANY OUTAGE AFFECTING EMERGENCY WARNING CAPABILITIES WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES. OF THE OUTAGE -- CALLOUS WITH THEN LET LOCAL MERCY PERSONAL KNOW THAT THESE CHANGES WILL ENSURE ALL THE NECESSARY -- MERCY OFFICIALS ARE GETTING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE. I WILL TELL YOU THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. I DON'T THINK IT IS SOON ENOUGH I THINK SIXTY MINUTES IS A LITTLE BIT LONG -- BUT WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IS THIS GIVES US THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WERE ALREADY IN CONTACT WITH -- YES WHEN FIRES ARE STARTING TO BREAK OUT BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION IN TERMS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER EIGHTH SEVENTY TOWERS WERE LOST WITHIN THE INITIAL HOURS OF THE EVENT. WHICH REALLY IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO NOTIFY THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT -- ONCE ONCE THOSE TOWERS ARE DOWN -- IN ALL BETS ARE OFF MOST PEOPLE RUN AROUND AT THAT POINT. IN WHAT THIS WILL DO THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES LET THAT LET US KNOW THAT THERE IS A FAST MOVING FIRE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL ISSUE AND WE HAVE TO NOTIFY MUCH SOONER. MUCH SOONER THAN LATER. SB SIX SEVENTY WILL ENSURE THAT OUR STATE AND LOCAL MERCY OFFICIALS AND AND FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION THEY NEED TO RESPOND. TO THOSE EXTRA MINUTES THAT COULD SAVE LIVES. THIS BILL IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MAJORS THAT COME BEFORE THE LEFT THI LEGISLATION -- SESSION IT IS. PAST SUPPORT OF CAL CHIEFS -- MY MAYOR -- UNFORTUNATELY FOR US WE COULDN'T GET IT THROUGH THE CITY PROCESS AND CONCEPT -- SUPPORT THIS 1100% AND MAYOR TOM WHAT HOME IS IN HIS FULL SUPPORT OF THIS -- AND IN I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TO TO SPEAK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ANYONE ELSE MORE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR REMEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK ESSICK. AND THE SHERIFF THE CINEMA COUNTY. ALSO A LIFELONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENT. AND MY FAMILY'S BEEN IN CINEMA COUNTY SINCE. EIGHTEEN NINETY I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED. AND I'M HERE AT THE REQUEST SENATE REQUIRED TO TALK ABOUT MY CONCERNS. IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE WITNESSED SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. IN CINEMA COUNTY ALONE THE FIRES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT THE LOSS OF TWENTY FOUR LIFE IN THE DESTRUCTION OF MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS AND OTHER STRUCTURES. AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. IT'S UNTHINKABLE DISASTER WAS MET HEAD ON BY THOUSANDS OF WELL TRAINED PUBLIC SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO SELF SACRIFICE PREVENTED GREATER DAMAGE. AND EVEN MORE LOSS OF LIFE. BUT TRAINING WILL ONLY TAKE A SO FAR WE MUST BE BACKED UP BY THE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE MORE COMPLEX CHALLENGES. THESE DISASTERS PROVED THAT ARE EMERGENCY TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM IS IN DIRE NEED. OF AN UPGRADE FOR RESIDENTS AND FIRST RESPONDERS ALIKE. SB SIX SEVENTY IS A SIMPLE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO NOTIFY CALLOW YES WHENEVER THERE IS A NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGE OR ANY OUTAGE AFFECTING EMERGENCY WARNING CAPABILITIES. WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES THE OUTAGE. THIS NOTIFICATION THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WOULD ALLOW IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION OF FIRST RESPONDERS LOCALLY. BY ALLOWING OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS TO KICK IN. AND BE PREPARED. FOR FIRST RESPONDERS MINUTES EQUAL LIVES. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE TUBS FIRE RIPPED AT ABOUT NINE FORTY FIVE PM. BY MIDNIGHT TWO HOURS LATER THE FLAMES ROUTE PASSING CARS AND EVACUEES. WE HAVE FLAMES MOVING FASTER THAN WE CAN EVACUATE PEOPLE. ROADS WERE BLOCKED RESIDENTS FOUGHT. FIRST RESPONDERS TRIED TO GET IN AND SAVE LIVES. DURING THE FIRES AT MONTHS SOME SEVENTY COMMUNICATION TOWERS WERE LOST AND WITHIN THE CRITICAL LIFELINE FOR RESIDENTS AND EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THOSE TOWERS PREVENTED OUR ABILITY TO SEND OUT ALERT AND WARNING. IT TOOK MORE THAN SIX HOURS. FOR THE CPUC TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION FROM THE FCC THAT THESE TOWERS WERE DOWN. AND THAT NINE ONE ONE SERVICE OUTAGES WERE OCCURRING. THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WAS NEVER FORMALLY NOTED NOTIFIED AT ALL. IN THE CAMP FIRE MOST RECENTLY IN BUTTE COUNTY. THAT TIME LAPSE WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE HOURS AGAIN PREVENTING. CRITICAL NOTIFICATIONS. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AS WERE SPYING DISASTER WE NEED TO ALL HAVE THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND DATA THAT WE CAN GET AS FIRST RESPONDERS. WE NEED TO KNOW THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS WILL BE OUR PARTNERS EMERGENCY RESPONSE. I BELIEVE THAT SIX SB SIX SEVENTY IS A SOLID FIRST STEP TOWARD ENSURING THAT OUR STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY OFFICIALS HAVE CRITICAL INFORMATION NEEDED TO RESPOND WHEN THOSE EXTRA MINUTES COULD SAVE LIVES THANK VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE AND SPEAKING SUPPORT. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL YOU'RE ON WE HAVE THE BOARDS TO RISE TO NAPA AND SONOMA COUNTIES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MR TERM MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING KIANA ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA MAYOR CONTROLLED HOME IS THE FIRE CHIEF HAD NOTED. MORNING THREE ZERO COUNTY REPRESENTS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT.

OUR CARMEN CARBON EMISSIONS. I AS A MEMBERS WILL RECALL I AUTHORED AS P. FORTY FORTY LAST YEAR WHICH REQUIRES A CPUC. TO ESTABLISH PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR BY A METHANE THIS BILL IS COMPLEMENTARY. BUT OF A MODEST EFFORT -- IN THAT REGARD IT WILL EXTEND THE SUNSET THAT DATE BY FIVE YEARS OF OF AS BEFORE -- FIVE SEVEN FROM -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX IT'S AN EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO SUCCESSFUL SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE BY OMITTING PROJECTS. THAT -- INTERCONNECT THE GAS UTILITY PIPELINE SYSTEM BASICALLY WORK WORK WERE INJECTING. VERY CLEAN RENEWABLE BIO METHANE INTO OUR EXISTING. UP. A GAS PIPELINES UNDER THIS ODD A SPECIFIC PROGRAM THIS EXTENDS -- THE THE THE TIMELINE. I'D IT EXTENDS THE SUNSET DATE THOSE STEP BY STATUTE -- SO -- HICKS -- IT'LL ALLOW FOR THOSE IMPROVEMENTS TAKE PLACE MOVING FORWARD. AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS WE HAVE SOME. TEST TEST PEOPLE HERE TESTIFIED ON THIS NINA COMPORT IN PARTICULAR. GOOD MORNING AT MEMBERS NEEDING SUPPORT THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MEMBERS IN EVERY SECTOR OF THE INDUSTRY AND WE REALLY PROPONENTS OF AB NINETEEN HUNDRED GADO THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THAT ENABLED -- THE CREATION OF THIS PROGRAM AND ALSO THE SPONSORS OF SB. FOURTEEN FORTY IN ITS MOST RECENT SCOPING PLAN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD RECOMMENDS REPLACING FALSE APPEALS WITH RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS REDUCING DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS AND MOVING TOWARDS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA. ACHIEVE ITS TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGET HOWEVER THE HIGH COST OF PIPELINE INTERCONNECTION HAS LED TO EVEN CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANIES CONSTRUCTING THE MAJORITY OF OUR ENERGY PRODUCTION FACILITIES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. IRONICALLY MOST OF THE RG PRODUCED IS THEN SENT BACK TO CALIFORNIA -- FOR COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS CALIFORNIA PROGRAMS AND SO AT THIS PROGRAM HAS REALLY HELPED TO ENHANCE THE COMPETITIVENESS OF IN STATE -- PARK PROJECTS AND WE ADD THESE YESTERDAY AFTER I VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. MISTER FOUR ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING CAM CARMICHAEL AND HAVE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY TO ADDITIONAL POINTS -- THEIR RESOURCES BORDERS ON RECORD IN THIS BUILDING A COUPLE TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR SAYING THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A STRATEGY FOR NOBLE GAS. WE DON'T HAVE A CLIMATE STRATEGY FOR CALIFORNIA I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT BECAUSE OF THE POTENCY OF METHANE. WE NEED TO HAVE. BILLS LIKE THIS TO ENABLE US TO ADDRESS OR NOBLE GAS. AND USE IT IN CALIFORNIA -- SECOND POINT IS THE SUM OF THE COMMENT LETTERS FOCUSED ON DAIRIES. YES THAT'S A BIG. PART OF THIS CHALLENGE AN OPPORTUNITY. SHE'S ME BUT I ALSO WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THERE ARE CAL RECYCLE ORGANIC DIVERSION. TARGETS COMING ONLINE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THAT ARE GOING TO REQUIRE -- THAT WE DO DEAL WITH ORGANIC WASTE FROM OUR URBAN AREAS AND THIS BILL WILL SUPPORT THAT PROCESS AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING JUST SIGH YOUNG ON BEHALF OF THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- BACK IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK. THANK YOU AND MICHAEL BOCA DOOR OKAY HALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION -- OUR MEMBERS ARE BUILDING MANY OF THE BILE NOTHING WE'VE GOT FIFTY A PROJECTS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. THEY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS NOT JUST TO BUY METHANE AND REDUCTION OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND HELPING THE STATE ACHIEVEMENTS GHG. THEY'RE ALSO PROVIDING TREMENDOUS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS CRITERIA POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS. THROUGH THEREPLACEMENT OF DIESEL WITH RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND TRUCKS AND ANOTHER SOME OPPOSITION THAT'S GOING TO TESTIFY. ALL AND THERE AND BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SHOULD THERE BE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANKS FOR COMING ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. VVC IN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- A A JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS OF NOTE -- I I THINK THAT WOULD LIKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY THIS EXTENSION IS IS NECESSARY. ALREADY A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES. HAVE GONE OUT THE DOOR FOR DERRIDA JESTERS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IT'S UNCLEAR WHY WE NEED TO EXTEND THIS PROGRAM THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IS CAPTURED. IN THAT HALF BILLION AND THE REASONS WHY WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THIS MONEY OUT THE DOOR I THINK -- ARE AT ONE OF OUR PRIMARY ISSUES PRIMARY POINTS IS THAT WHILE WE'RE STILL IN KIND OF THE DEVELOPMENT MODE AND AND AND AND TROUBLE SHOOTING AND THE DIETARY DIGESTION PROGRAM. IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO PAUSE AT THIS POINT. AND STOP PUTTING MORE AND MORE MONEY INTO THIS INDUSTRY -- AS I SAID CAN MORE THAN HALF A BILLION DOLLARS HAS ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED -- AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE DOLLARS INVESTED INTO REAL CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS BY A METHANE IS NOT A CLEAN ENERGY ALTERNATIVE. AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF INVESTING IN REAL CLEAN ENERGY. THANKS SO MUCH YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. JULIE JORDAN HERE TODAY REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE -- THIS BILL MAY APPEAR TO SIMPLY JUST EXTEND THE SUNSET BUT IN REALITY IT SUPPORTS THE PHYSICAL MONETARY GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HINDERS CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESS TOWARDS TRULY CLEAN AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. BY OMITTING IS NOT A CLEAN FUEL IT CAPITALIZE ON UNSUSTAINABLE LARGE SCALE HIGHLY POLLUTING DAIRY INDUSTRIES THAT CURRENTLY DOMINATE THE STATE. POLLUTE AIR AND CONTAMINATE WATER AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LIVING IN RURAL AREAS NEAR DIE JESTERS AND OTHER FACILITIES. BY CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THE POLICY IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BIO GAS WE ARE ONLY PROLONGING THE EFFECTS OF DAMAGING FACTORY FARM PRACTICES AND INCENTIVIZING LARGER AND LARGER DAIRIES. IN LARGER HERDS SIZES AND IN TURN INCREASED ENTERICA MISSIONS WHICH ARE HALF OF THE METHANE PROBLEM. SO I US FOR MY COLLEAGUE IN OPPOSING SB FOUR FIFTY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHAT IS YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY A LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU? THANK YOU. REBECCA MARKETS REPRESENTING FOOD AND WATER WATCH ALSO A LINER COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES. LAUREN CALLING ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA ALSO LINER COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR STROM THANK YOU. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND SENATOR WE SO I JUST WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR EXTENDING THIS -- SUNSET -- SEE OUR IN OUR IS IN PARIS I DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO VISIT THE THIRD AYE CHESTER. BUT IT'S AN AMAZING SET UP THAT THEY WERE THE BENEFICIARIES SOME OF THESE FUNDS AND THEY ARE CONNECTED TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS LINES BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. FOR FOR ME AND PROBABLY MANY OF US THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IS IT. ALL OF THEIR TRASH TRUCKS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR ALL THE MUNICIPALITIES IF THEY SERVE. IS -- FUELED BY THE NATURAL GAS THAT THEY CREATE ONSITE. SO THAT'S A GREAT TESTIMONIAL FOR WORK FOR YOU AND FOR THIS BILL AND I'D LIKE TO MOVE IT TO THE PROPER TIME AND BE OUT TO US AT A LOCAL AUTHOR IF I COULD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. CENTER STONE CENTER GOD I'M I JUST LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. IF YOU DON'T IF. YEAH I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OPPOSITION WOULD WANT TO DO WITH THE THE WAYS FROM THESE DAIRY OPERATIONS NO FRANKLY I LOOK AT THIS AND SAY. YEAH THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE WHAT WERE ALREADY USING WERE CONSUMING WE HEARD ABOUT SHORT TERM CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. WE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS. IN A IN I I JUST INTERESTED IN YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON IF NOT THIS WEEK WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY. THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION I WOULD LOVE -- TED IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO GOING TO MEET WITH US TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW WE FEEL. AND WE COULD CAN BETTER ADDRESS THAT THE AG INDUSTRY IN THE CLEAN ENERGY -- ECONOMY. IN SHORT -- THERE'S AT A FALSE CHOICE THAT WE'RE FACED WITH WITH RESPECT -- TO ALLOWING AND MANY WERE PETS TO CONTINUE TO FESTER AN OFF GAS OR INVESTING IN DIGEST THERE'S THERE'S OTHER ALTERNATIVES ARE THE ALTAR OF THE NEWER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THERE'S THERE'S INVESTING THIS IN A FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND COUNTING. INTO TRANSITIONING TO NOT JUST CLEAN ENERGY THE MORE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING PRACTICES OR NOT -- ACTUALLY PRODUCING METHANE PREVENTING THAT THE CREATION OF METHANE WHICH ALTER OF ENORMOUS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES DO -- AND THAT WE COULD BE THINKING BIGGER AND TAKING BETTER AS CALIFORNIANS DR. S. THE MISTER BOGARD TO RESPOND TO THAT. CERTAINLY ON THE DAIRY INDUSTRY'S BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE STATE SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TO REDUCE METHOD. AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ALL WHOLE ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH AND WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BOTH THE ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE PROGRAM THAT ON THE SEAT REFERENCE. WERE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE DAILY DIGEST A PROGRAM. ME JUST SAY ONE THING ABOUT THE DERRY DIGESTED PROGRAM QUICKLY. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT IS STATE IS INVESTING GDR UP DOLLARS AND TODAY. THE CHEATING OR EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE MORE REDUCTIONS IN ANY OTHER PROGRAM RECEIVING INVESTMENTS. AND IT'S A PROGRAM THAT IS THE SECOND MOST COST EFFECTIVE IT DOWN PROVIDING REDUCTION SAID ABOUT SEPP EVERY EIGHT TO NINE DOLLARS A STATE AND BASS. WE GET A TON A REDUCTION IT'S ALL METHOD. WHICH MEANS THAT SHORT LIVE WHICH MEANS WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE BENEFITS QUICKER THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM. AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE TAKING THE BIO GAS AND TURNING IT INTO TRANSPORTATION FUEL IT'S CLEAN BURNING THEY CAN REPLACE DIESEL AND TRUCKS AS MR STONE MENTIONED. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY CAN HAPPEN IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY SO WE CAN EXTEND THE BENEFITS. IT'S TREMENDOUS I THINK SENATOR MCCAIN MCGUIRE. I SPOKE ABOUT THIS IN COMMITTEE LAST WEEK I'M THESE AE GREAT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED WE NEED TO CONTINUE. THERE'S NO WAY TO ACHIEVE THE THE STATE'S LOOKING FOR WITH THE ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WE NEED THE DIGESTIVE PROGRAM AS WELL [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR MCGUIRE.
