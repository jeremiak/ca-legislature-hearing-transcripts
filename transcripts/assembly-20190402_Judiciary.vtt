00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.072
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCHERS AT UCLA

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.074
LAW PROFESSORS AT UC BERKELEY

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:12.076
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCHERS AT UC

00:30:12.143 --> 00:30:14.112
DAVIS AND ABORTION RESEARCHERS

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:15.146
AT UCSF.

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.481
HAVE ALL BEEN HARASSED BY

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:18.449
EXPANSIVE AND INTRUSIVE PUBLIC

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.350
RECORDS REQUESTS FROM

00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:21.486
IDEOLOGICAL OPPONENTS OF THEIR

00:30:21.553 --> 00:30:22.921
RESEARCH.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:24.355
SMITH ALSO DETERS SCHOLARS FROM

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:26.658
PURSUING CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS I

00:30:26.724 --> 00:30:28.560
RECENTLY HAD A UC BERKELEY

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:29.227
SCHOLAR TELL ME.

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:30.028
THAT SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:31.863
ABANDONING RESEARCH ON TITLE

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.598
NINE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT BECAUSE

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:34.866
THE THOUGHT OF PUBLIC RECORDS

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.202
REQUESTS SOUNDED QUOTE

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:38.503
UNBEARABLY AWFUL.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:39.971
I'VE SPENT TWO YEARS RESEARCHING

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:41.072
THIS PHENOMENON OF SCHOLAR

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.807
HARASSMENT AND I'VE DOCUMENTED

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:44.909
MANY CASES IN AN ARTICLE IN THE

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:47.579
UCLA LAW REVIEW THAT'S AVAILABLE

00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:48.680
FREE ONLINE.

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:50.582
SECOND THE SCHOLAR HARASSMENT

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.116
PROBLEM IS FIXABLE.

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.751
AB SEVEN HUNDRED IS A CAREFUL

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:55.820
SOLUTIONS THAT I'VE ENDORSED

00:30:55.887 --> 00:30:57.488
ALONG WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:58.423
AND EIGHTY ACADEMICS ACROSS

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:00.491
CALIFORNIA IN EVERY ACADEMIC

00:31:00.558 --> 00:31:01.859
DISCIPLINE.

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.294
THE BILL DOES WHAT MANY STATE

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.196
OPEN RECORDS LAWS ACTUALLY DID

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.097
FROM THE BEGINNING BUT

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:07.599
UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S DID

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.000
NOT.

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:10.201
IT PROTECTS AN INTELLECTUAL

00:31:10.268 --> 00:31:11.669
SPACE.

00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:13.438
THE PROFESSORS NEED TO REFINE

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:15.440
THEIR IDEAS SUCH AS BY PRODUCING

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:17.141
ROUGH DRAFTS OF ARTICLES.

00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:18.943
IT ALSO PROTECTS COMMUNICATION

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.645
BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AND THEIR

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.413
PROFESSIONAL PEERS THROUGH THE

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.015
FORMAL PEER REVIEW PROCESS BUT

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:25.583
ALSO ALSO THROUGH MUCH LESS

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.785
FORMAL EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.487
THROUGH WHICH THEY TEST IDEAS.

00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:30.822
IF THESE CHANNELS CAN'T BE

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:33.358
TRUSTED TO BE PRIVATE AND CANDID

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:34.859
SPACES.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:36.661
RESEARCH COLLABORATION AND

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.997
CANDOR DISAPPEAR AND THAT'S BAD

00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.898
FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS BAD FOR

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:43.034
SOCIETY.

00:31:43.101 --> 00:31:43.635
THIS LEADS ME TO MY THIRD AND

00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:44.669
FINAL POINT.

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.838
THE EXISTING EXEMPTIONS IN OUR

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:48.273
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT HAVE PROVEN

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:49.774
WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO PROTECT

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.110
RESEARCH.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.144
THERE'S AN EXEMPTION FOR

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:54.779
PRELIMINARY DRAFTS AND A CATCH

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.748
ALL EXEMPTION BUT THEY BOTH

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.816
CONVERGE IN A BALANCING TEST

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:00.084
THAT ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES AN

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:01.986
INTENSIVE FACT SPECIFIC

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:04.055
SOMETIMES DOCUMENTS SPECIFIC

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:05.023
INQUIRY.

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:06.791
INTO WHETHER IT IS FOR OR

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:08.459
AGAINST THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:10.628
RELEASE THAT PARTICULAR DOCUMENT

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:12.163
AND THAT MEANS THAT RESEARCHERS

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.698
ARE PULLED OUT OF THEIR LABS AND

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.166
OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AND INTO

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:17.568
MULTI YEAR COURT BATTLES TO TRY

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.903
TO PROTECT RESEARCH.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.371
YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS TODAY

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:21.439
FROM DOCTOR SMITH.

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:23.207
THIS WOULDN'T BE THE CASE IF WE

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.842
HAD A BRIGHT LINE RULE AS TO

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:26.577
WHICH TYPES OF RESEARCH LIMITED

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.946
TYPES OF RESEARCH RECORDS ARE

00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:30.515
EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE.

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:31.616
AND THESE CRITICISMS OF OUR

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:33.017
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT ARE NOT JUST

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:34.552
MY OPINION.

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:35.953
THERE THE OPINION OF THE CLIMATE

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:37.689
SCIENCE LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:39.957
DID A SURVEY OF EVERY STATE

00:32:40.024 --> 00:32:41.526
PUBLIC RECORDS LAW IN AMERICA.

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.194
AND GAVE CALIFORNIA'S A LETTER

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:45.296
GRADE OF C. FOR RESEARCHER

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.598
PROTECTION.

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:48.733
I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE WORLD'S

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.601
NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY

00:32:50.668 --> 00:32:51.836
SYSTEM IT SHOULD NOT HAVE THAT

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:53.171
GREAT ON ITS TRANSCRIPT.

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:55.740

THE UC SYSTEM.

00:33:10.521 --> 00:33:11.556
I'M OVER CAREER SPENDING ABOUT

00:33:11.622 --> 00:33:12.123
TWENTY FIVE YEARS I'VE HELP

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.057

SOURCES OF THE TOXIC METAL LEAD

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:17.495
AND WE'VE USE THAT METHOD AND IN

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:19.063
CASES OF LET A LEAD POISONING

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:22.567
IN OUR WORK WITH ENDANGERED

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:23.868
CALIFORNIA CONDORS SHOW THAT

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:25.336
LEAD POISONING FROM INGESTION OF

00:33:25.403 --> 00:33:27.171
LET FRAGMENTS IN ANIMAL SHOT

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.239
WOULD LEAD AMMUNITION WAS THE

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.741
MAIN SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING.

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.876
IT WAS PRECLUDING THE RECOVERY

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.544
OF WILD CONDORS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.946
THIS WORK PROVIDED IMPORTANT

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.647
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON THE HARM

FROM JOURNALISTS.

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.907
WHO HAVE RECEIVED RESPONSES FROM

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:24.775
AGENCIES THAT REFUSE TO PROVIDE

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:26.077
RECORDS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY

00:37:26.143 --> 00:37:29.914
RESPONSIVE? TOO MANY AGENCIES.

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.782
WILL FIND ANY EXCUSE NOT TO

DISCLOSE RECORDS AND IT'S FROM

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:34.919
THIS VANTAGE POINT THE REALITY

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.487
THAT ALLEGED ABUSE OF THE PUBLIC

00:37:36.554 --> 00:37:38.489
RECORDS ACT IS COMMITTED JUST AS

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:39.824
MUCH AND LIKELY MORE.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.559
BY AGENCIES THEM BY REQUEST

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:42.560
STIRS THAT WE BELIEVE NEW

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:44.495
EXEMPTIONS TO DISCLOSURE SHOULD

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:45.529
BE CONSIDERED.

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:46.797
THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:48.399
DESIGNED TO BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:49.700
TO CONFORM TO SITUATIONS THAT

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:50.601
HAVE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:52.536
SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED WHEN THE

00:37:52.603 --> 00:37:53.671
LAW WAS ENACTED.

00:37:53.738 --> 00:37:54.739
AND NOWHERE IS THIS MORE

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:55.840
IMPORTANT THAN IN THE CATCH ALL

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:57.608
EXEMPTION IN LIGHT OF THIS THE

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:58.843
DETERMINATION THAT SHOULD BE

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:00.544
MADE ANY TIME IN NEW EXEMPTION

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:02.013
TO DISCLOSURE IS CONSIDERED.

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.981
IS WHETHER SPECIFIC PROBLEM

00:38:04.048 --> 00:38:05.616
EXISTS IN WHICH THE PUBLIC'S

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:07.084
INTEREST.

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:08.786
IS SERVED BY NON DISCLOSURE IS

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:10.921
AND IS NOT ALREADY COVERED BY AN

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:12.890
EXISTING EXEMPTION ONLY ONCE

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.191
THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.192
SHOULD A NEW EXEMPTION BE

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.293
CONSIDERED AND THEN THE NEW

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.361
EXEMPTION SHOULD BE VERY

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:18.729
NARROWLY TAILORED.

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:20.898
UNFORTUNATELY AB SEVEN HUNDRED

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:21.866
DOES NOT YET PASSED THE

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:23.668
THRESHOLDS EVEN WITH THE

00:38:23.734 --> 00:38:25.169
AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN --

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.971
ACCEPTED TODAY WE BELIEVE THE

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.272
EXEMPTION PROVISIONS THE BILL

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:29.874
ARE STILL TOO BROAD AND WOULD

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.908
ALLOW CIRCUMSTANCES OF

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:32.376
RESEARCHER MISCONDUCT.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:35.012
AN UNDUE INFLUENCE OVER RESEARCH

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:35.413
TO BE CONCEALED.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:38.416
WE ARE ALSO CONCERNS THAT -- THE

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:39.183
APPROACH OF THE BILL OF

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:40.985
EXEMPTING THESE CATEGORIES AND

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.453
THEN BRINGING BACK IN CERTAIN

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.854
CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS THAT

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:45.289
WOULD NOT BE EXEMPT FROM

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:46.290
DISCLOSURE.

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:48.159
IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAWS

00:38:48.225 --> 00:38:51.362
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF HAVING

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.763
RECORDS BE TO SCHOOLS WILL IT

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.098
EXCEPT IN VERY NARROW

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.167
CIRCUMSTANCES. TO BE CLEAR WE

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:57.935
DON'T CONDONE HARASSMENT OF ANY

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.937
INDIVIDUAL AND WE CERTAINLY WANT

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.305
OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO BE

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:02.840
COMPETITIVE WITH THEIR CAP --

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.041
PRIVATE COUNTERPARTS.

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:05.376
BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT GOING

00:39:05.443 --> 00:39:06.410
DOWN THE ROAD OF SHIELDING

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:07.845
RECORDS FROM DISCLOSURE OVER

00:39:07.912 --> 00:39:08.913
CONCERNED THAT SOMEONE WILL BE

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:11.515
CRITICIZES VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE.

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:12.583
AND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.051
THAT FOR EVERY STORY OF A

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:16.887
RESEARCHER WHO HAS HAD A PUBLIC

00:39:16.954 --> 00:39:17.922

IMPROPER OVERSIGHT BY

UNIVERSITIES AND UNDUE INFLUENCE

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.335
IN THE RESEARCH PROCESS.

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.203
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.504
EXEMPTION THIS BILL COULD ALSO

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:34.805
BE EXPLOITED BY THE VERY

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.373
INTEREST GROUPS AT WHICH THE

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.908
BILL IS AIMED AT ALLOWING THEM

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.443
TO EXERT GREATER CONTROL OVER

RESEARCH PROCESS SEES WITHOUT

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:44.014
FEAR OF EXPOSURE. TO BE SURE THE

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.449
TASK OF CRAFTING EXEMPTION

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.351
THAT'S NARROW ENOUGH TO PRODUCE

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:48.652
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.621
AUTHOR WHILE STILL NOT HARMING

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:52.256
THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW IS A

00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.591
VERY DIFFICULT TASK.

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:54.892

SO FAR WE BELIEVE NEED MORE WORK

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:59.230
IS NEEDED WE'RE COMMITTED TO

00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:00.131
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:01.866

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.979
BILL WE NEVER THE REMAINED.

00:40:15.045 --> 00:40:17.848
CLOSED THE URINALYSIS DESCRIBES

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:20.117
THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO MODERNIZE --

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.652
THE CPR A IF IF THIS IS

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.954
MODERNIZATION I THINK WE FIND

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:26.957
OURSELVES ON AS I HAVING TO

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:27.558

ON THIS ISSUE -- THE TESTIMONY

TODAY DESCRIBED EXISTING LAW IS

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:35.733
INSUFFICIENT -- BECAUSE IT

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.835
RELIES ON A CASE BY CASE

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:40.304

JUSTIFICATION FOR EXCLUSION IN

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.114
EACH PARTICULAR CASE WE THINK

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:51.182
THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH NOT

00:40:51.248 --> 00:40:52.416
THE WRONG APPROACH AND IT SERVED

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.519
US WELL -- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:58.389

FOR ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:05.262

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.167
IT APPROPRIATELY.

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:12.236
WITHOUT ALSO TAKING IT AWAY FROM

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.205
THOSE WHO USE IT FOR IMPORTANT

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:18.075

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.822
AS THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

SO HERE'S WHAT I'VE BEEN

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:42.873
STRUGGLING WITH A FIRST OF ALL

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.441
IT'S IT'S A LITTLE HARD. TO

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:45.976
THINK OF SOMEONE WHO IS

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:47.311
EXERCISING A RIGHT THAT WE'VE

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:48.245
GIVEN THEM UNDER LAW AS

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.214
HARASSMENT AND AND I UNDERSTAND

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.416
THAT FEELS HARASSING BUT THAT'S

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:53.817
THAT'S SORT OF A HARD.

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.686
STEP TO TAKE [inaudible]

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:58.422
AND EVERY TIME WE TOUCH THE

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.457
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THERE'S A TWO

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.259
EDGED SWORD THAT GOES ON HERE.

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:05.129
SO THE NOTION OF TRYING TO VERY

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:08.298
NARROWLY TAILOR SOMETHING. TO BE

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.533
ABLE TO PROTECT.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.001
IN TERM THE BEGINNINGS OF

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.169
RESEARCH.

00:46:12.236 --> 00:46:15.205
A IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR THAT THE

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.773
ACADEMICS TO DO THE KINDS OF

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.208
PROBING THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:19.409
THAT CONTEXT.

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:21.778
IS THERE'S A SOMETHING THERE

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.847
THAT THAT I THINK IS IS OF A

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.482
WORTHWHILE INQUIRY.

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:27.818
BUT THE AND I THINK THAT I'M

00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.620
RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE AND I

00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:32.156
THINK WE HAPPY TO MOVE THIS OUT

00:46:32.222 --> 00:46:33.690
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE KEEPING I

00:46:33.757 --> 00:46:35.025
THINK PRETTY CLOSE WATCH.

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:36.793
ON THIS BECAUSE OF THE BROADER

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.127
IMPLICATIONS.

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:39.062
THAT.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.731
IF THIS AT ALL HAS A CHILLING

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:42.566
EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:43.901
REACH IN AND UNDERSTAND THE

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.135
KINDS OF RESEARCH THAT ARE GOING

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:48.105
ON IN GENERAL CATEGORIES.

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:49.573
FOR UNDERSTANDS.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.941
REALLY WHAT'S.

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:51.708
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.911
RESEARCH THESE ARE PUBLIC

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.546
INSTITUTIONS THAT WHERE.

00:46:55.612 --> 00:46:57.347
CLOSING THE DOOR TO AND I THINK

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.216
WE NEED TO BE TO TREAD VERY

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:02.319
CAREFULLY WHEN WE TRY TO DO THAT

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:02.619
[inaudible]

00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:06.056
SO THE YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THE

00:47:06.123 --> 00:47:07.324
EVERY PUBLIC AGENCY DEALS WITH

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:08.292
THIS I THINK WE'VE HEARD

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:09.560
TESTIMONY WE CONSTANTLY HEAR

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:11.161
TESTIMONY OF PUBLIC AGENCIES AND

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.796
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A VERY.

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.364
PROMINENT CASE WHERE THERE'S A

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:15.832
LOT ABOUT DISCLOSURE THAT IS

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:18.202
PRETTY MUCH BEING NEGLECTED AND

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:19.336
AND ABUSE AND AND OVER WRITTEN

00:47:19.403 --> 00:47:21.271
AND SO WITH.

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.240
AS WE TRY THESE DISTINCTIONS.

00:47:23.307 --> 00:47:24.508
AT AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:26.210
WORKING WITH ON THIS TO TRY AND

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.045
MAKE THIS IS NARROWLY CRAFTED AS

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.146
POSSIBLE.

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:30.547
SO THAT WE ARE NOT.

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.249
ALLOWING.

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:34.117
ANY PUBLIC AGENCY UNIVERSITIES

00:47:34.184 --> 00:47:35.953
ARE OTHERS TO HAVE ANY UNDUE

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.088
EXCUSE ULTIMATELY TO HIDE THINGS

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:39.590
THAT THEY KNOW WOULD BE

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.258
CONTROVERSIAL.

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.159
JUST FOR THE SAKE OF THE

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:43.460
CONTROVERSY ME HIDING JUST A

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:44.428
HIGH.

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:47.631
AS OPPOSED TO DISCLOSING

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.800
ELEMENTS OF THAT RESEARCH THAT

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:52.402
MAY BE PREJUDICIAL TO GETTING

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:53.837
THAT RESEARCH DONE.

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:54.938
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.373
ATTEMPT HERE I DON'T.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.708
KNOW THAT WE NECESSARILY

00:47:57.774 --> 00:47:59.309
THREADED IT CORRECTLY BUT I

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:02.012
THINK WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:04.581
GO DAY IN INTO THAT DIRECTION.

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.850
BUT THAT THE OF THE OPPOSITION

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:09.152
BRINGS GOOD POINTS IN WHAT WE'RE

00:48:09.219 --> 00:48:11.421
CHANGING.

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:13.123
CHANGING SLIGHTLY THE PHILOSOPHY

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:14.658
WHERE WE HAD TRIED TO MAKE

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.026
EVERYTHING DISCLOSE A BALL.

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:17.928
OTHER THAN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:19.496
AND THERE IS A BIRD TO THAT ON

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:21.665
ANY AGENCY HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:22.733
OF THESE I'VE BEEN IN AGENCIES

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:23.867
HAVE BEEN SUBJECT THESE.

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:25.035
THERE IS A BURDEN TO THAT THAT'S

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:27.237
BUILT INTO THE FACT THAT WE'RE A

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:27.771
PUBLIC AGENCY [inaudible]

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:29.039
AND THAT.

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:31.041
HAS TO BE THE CASE.

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:34.077
SO AS WE TRY AND NARROWLY TAILOR

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:36.246
THIS AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:36.880
WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION AND

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:37.848
I WOULD HOPE.

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:40.550
THAT IF YOU CAN'T.

00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:42.653
THREAD THAT NEEDLE OR DEPENDING

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:43.620
ON HOW THIS.

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:44.721
WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE AS IT MOVES

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:46.056
THROUGH WE MAY BE WANTING TO SEE

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.624

00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:48.759
AGREE?

00:48:48.825 --> 00:48:50.093
WITH HOW YOU THROW THAT NEEDLE

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.728
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE VERY

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.196
CAREFUL THAT WE ARE NOT.

00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:55.766
SHUTTING DOWN THAT THE PUBLIC'S

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:58.769
RIGHT. TO KNOW EITHER IN BROADER

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.570
CATEGORIES OR SORT OF WHAT'S

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:01.972
HAPPENING IN THE UNIVERSITIES

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.473

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.481
BILL HERE TODAY.

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:12.649
THAT I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO BE

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.418
DILIGENT THAT IF WE DO PASS

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:15.319
SOMETHING AND IT GOES TO THE

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.620
LEGISLATURE DOES GET SIDE BY THE

00:49:16.687 --> 00:49:17.754
GOVERNOR.

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:18.689
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:20.624
TESTING IT AND UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:22.959
IT GETS USED AND AND ACT QUICKLY

00:49:23.026 --> 00:49:24.695
IF WE FEEL THAT THIS IS

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:29.433
UNNECESSARILY CLOSING OFF ACCESS

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:31.501
TO TO PUBLIC INFORMATION.

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.970
SO WITH THAT MISTER KALRA LIMóN

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.672
SERVICE.

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:39.309
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- FOR

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:39.876
FOR YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE I

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.478
THINK -- THE THEY'RE VERY

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.746
HELPFUL AND I THINK YOU IN YOUR

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:43.880
YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO WORK ON

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:44.081
THIS.

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:45.649
HAS BEEN EXCELLENT.

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.249
I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:49.152
THINK THAT THERE'S A REASON WHY

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:51.188
ALL THE OPPOSITION IS.

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:52.656
IT WOULD A GROUP A POSITIVE IN

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:53.657
TERMS OF THE WORK THAT THEY'VE

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:55.325
DONE WITH THE AUTHOR EVEN IF

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:56.793
THEY COULD PRINCIPALLY CAN'T BE

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.262
THERE AND I THINK THAT -- YOUR

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.965
YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU IN

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:03.400
A GOOD WAY IN TERMS OF BEING

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:04.701
WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.536
IN GENERAL TO TRY TO RESOLVE

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:07.437
ISSUES.

00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.106
AND I THINK THAT'S EXEMPLIFIED

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.173
BY QUITE A FEW PRETTY

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.175
SUBSTANTIVE AMENDMENTS -- AT

00:50:12.242 --> 00:50:13.276
THIS STAGE AND OBVIOUSLY THIS

00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:14.444
BILLS ON THE CONTINUE GOING

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.346
FORWARD AND I I WOULDN'T

00:50:16.413 --> 00:50:20.283
ACTUALLY SAY THAT FOR EVERY

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:22.018
AUTHOR I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE.

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:22.586
THE FALL IN THE CAN THE THE

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:23.687
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION BUT IN

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.389
THIS CASE I WILL BECAUSE I

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.656
REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:28.058
TRYING TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE IF

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:29.159
IT'S POSSIBLE.

00:50:29.226 --> 00:50:30.594
AND A I THINK THE INCREASE

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:33.063
WORTHWHILE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.232
POSSIBLE I THINK THAT YOU YOU

00:50:35.298 --> 00:50:36.666
AND THE OPPOSITE ARE GOING TO

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.201
TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF IT IS.

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:40.036
AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH THEIR

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:40.570
THIS BUILDING WE DO HAVE

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:41.772
PRINCIPLE OBJECTIONS OF THINGS

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:43.039
THAT WE DO.

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.374
AND AND WE HAVE TO BE CUT WITH

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:47.744
THAT AT TIMES BUT I THINK GIVEN.

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:50.013
THE AMOUNT OF IMPORTANCE OF THE

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.615
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND I KNOW

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:54.484
THE THE THE CHAIR CERTAINLY IS

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.920
IS RIGHTFULLY PROTECTIVE OF IT.

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.822
AND I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE I

00:50:58.889 --> 00:50:59.956
THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:01.091
THAT I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:04.094
MONITOR CLOSELY AND I KNOW THAT

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.061
THE THE AUTHOR.

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:05.562
WILL.

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:06.329
BE SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.397
CONTINUE TO WORK REALLY HARD

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.299
WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO FIND A

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:11.401
WAY. TO AMELIORATE AS MANY

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:12.736
CONCERNS OF HOPEFULLY ALL THE

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.538
CONCERNS BUT I THINK ON

00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:16.506
PRINCIPLE MAYBE NOT.

00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.707
BE ABLE TO AND THAT'S A MILLION

00:51:17.774 --> 00:51:19.075
ALL OF THEM BUT I THINK THAT TO

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:20.343
THE CHAIRS POINT.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:23.046
THERE IS SOMETHING HERE THAT I

00:51:23.113 --> 00:51:24.147
THINK A LEAD SINGER LEAD CIVIL

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:26.183
REQUIRES THAT INQUIRY.

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.484
AND I THINK THAT -- AND SO FOR

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.552
THE FACT ALONE I'M GRATEFUL THAT

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:29.519
THIS BILL IS HERE SO THAT WE

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.988
THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND THE

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.623
BOTH INTENDED AND UNINTENDED

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.158
CONSEQUENCES OF OUR ACTIONS AND

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:37.594
SO -- HYPE I LOOK FORWARD TO

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.296
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS I THINK

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:41.097
THAT IF IT COMES BACK TO US

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:44.167
BASED UPON SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS --

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:46.102
THAT -- WILL PEOPLE LOOKING VERY

00:51:46.169 --> 00:51:47.737
CLOSE AND EVEN AS IT GOES FOR

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:48.772
THE FOR I THINK ALL OF US KNOW

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.540
LOOK VERY CLOSELY TO SEE HOW

00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:52.309
SOME OF THE CONCERNS BEEN

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.143
FURTHER ADDRESS BECAUSE I KNOW

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.944
YOU'VE ADDRESS A LOT OF THEM

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.513
ALREADY -- IT BUT THE AMENDMENTS

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.148
TODAY SUCH WANTED THANK YOU AND

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:58.982
I THINK THE OPPOSITION AS WELL

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.417
FOR YOUR VERY CLEAR.

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:03.053
ABOUT RESPECTFUL -- POINTS THAT

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:04.521
WERE MADE I THINK THEY ARE

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:06.523
THEY'RE ALL OF HER THE POINTS AS

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.891
MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR.

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:10.060
AND I I THINK THAT IT

00:52:10.126 --> 00:52:10.560
DEMONSTRATES SOMETIMES A

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:13.630
DIFFICULT WORK THAT WE DO HERE --

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:15.165
IN IN IN TRYING.

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:16.533
TO DEAL WITH REAL LIFE

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:27.310
CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAW BUT

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.646
UNDERSTANDING THE PRE IT'S A

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:31.047
BOLD.

00:52:31.114 --> 00:52:32.449
NEED FOR THE LAW TO BE THERE.

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:33.149
JUST WANT.

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:33.717
TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS IN.

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:35.285
SUPPORT OF THE AUTHOR -- AND AND

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:35.852
THE WAY THAT SHE APPROACHES

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:38.488
BILLS WHICH I THINK IS DIFFICULT

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:39.055
TO DEAL BUT I THINK THAT YOU

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:39.990
DON'T WELL.

00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:41.892
THANK YOU MS REST.

00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:44.828
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:45.695
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT I

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:47.330
THINK WHEN I SAW THE ACLU AND

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.398
PETER AGAINST THE BILL -- WHEN I

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:49.299
SAW THAT IT WAS AN EXEMPTION TO

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:50.133
THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.368
ACT I KNEW WHERE I WAS GOING TO

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.502
BE?

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.303
BUT I ALSO KNEW WHO THE AUTHOR

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.504
WAS AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.672
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:56.973
AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.375
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU

00:52:58.441 --> 00:53:02.445
HAVE WORKED WITH THE AUTHOR -- I

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.880
IT'S A TOUGH.

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.181
ONE BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE

00:53:05.248 --> 00:53:07.484
DO HAVE TO PROTECT -- THE

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:09.486
RESEARCHERS AND AT OUR

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:11.521
UNIVERSITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:13.223
WE DON'T HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.358
ON THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:16.960
CONTINUE WITH THE RESEARCH

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:18.528
BECAUSE IN THE END.

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:22.532
THE PUBLIC BENEFITS SO DOES. ONE

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:23.767
OF THE QUESTIONS IS IS A PUBLIC

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:26.836
SERVICE WITH THIS NEW EXEMPTION --

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:28.538
AND THAT IS GOING TO BE THE

00:53:28.605 --> 00:53:30.473
QUESTION WILL CONTINUE TO ASK AS

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.008
IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS.

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:33.777
IS THE PUBLIC GOING TO BE SERVED

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:35.478
BY THIS EXEMPTION AND I

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.980
RECOGNIZE THAT IT WILL BE AS

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.582
NARROWLY CRAFTED AS POSSIBLE.

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:40.016
AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:40.750
COMMENTS THAT.

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.919
IF IT ISN'T.

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:44.654
THEY WILL BRING IT BACK AND IF

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.789
IT STILL ISN'T.

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.524
THEN THERE WILL BE A REQUEST OF

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:49.726
THE AUTHOR TO WITHDRAW IT -- I I

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:51.795
DO RESERVE THE RIGHT -- IF IT IS

00:53:51.861 --> 00:53:53.196
IF IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH THAT

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:55.432
PROCESS. TO TO VOTE NO ON THE

00:53:55.498 --> 00:53:58.301
FLOOR WE'LL RESERVE THE RIGHT --

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.703
BUT IT'S CLEAR.

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.004
BECAUSE OF THE PLAYERS HERE THAT

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:02.539
THIS IS ONE THAT WE WANT TO

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:05.942
WATCH AND AND IF IT CAN BE IF

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:07.177
THE NEEDLE CAN BE THREATENED.

00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.745
IT WILL BE I'M SURE [inaudible]

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:11.414
THANK YOU.

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:13.550
THE SERVER NOTING.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.818
I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I

00:54:14.884 --> 00:54:15.986
THINK THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE

00:54:16.052 --> 00:54:17.454
HEARD TODAY FROM THE RESEARCHERS

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.955
IS COMPELLING AND IT'S CLEAR

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:21.925
THAT THE CPR A CAN AND HAS BEEN

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.994
USED AND WEAPONIZED BY PEOPLE

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.862
WHO WANT TO STIFLE DEBATE ON

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:28.365
ISSUES -- BUT THAT IS ALSO TRUE

00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:29.633
FOR A LOT OF FIELDS OUTSIDE THE

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.134
FIELD OF RESEARCH AND SO I'M

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:32.902
WONDERING WHY A FOR ALL OF

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:33.503
KNOWLEDGE IN WITH THIS IS A

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.004
PROBLEM.

00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:36.406
WHY WERE NOT APPROACHING IT WITH

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:39.376
A SOLUTIONS TO THE CPR A RATHER

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.845
THAN A NARROW CATEGORICAL

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:43.813
EXEMPTION FOR JUST -- ONE

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.082
CATEGORY OF OF INFORMATION

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:48.852
THAT'S BEING -- THIS BEING A

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:55.558
TARGET -- WELL.

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:56.960
OUR AYE I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.628
THE QUESTION ARE YOU ASKING WHY

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.163
IT'S NOT A BROADER BILL WITH

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.266
LARGER EXEMPTIONS OR THAT

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:04.367
THERE'S MORE AREAS WHY ARE WE

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.635
TARGETING THE KIND OF ABUSIVE

00:55:05.702 --> 00:55:07.170
BEHAVIOUR THAT'S RESULTED IN

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:08.238
THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THIS

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:09.906
PROBLEM EXISTS NOT JUST FOR

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.274
RESEARCHERS BUT ALSO FOR OTHER.

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.410
CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION WHERE

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.911
A GROUP THAT WANTS TO STIFLE

00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:16.012
DEBATE ON AN ISSUE OF WEAPONIZED

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.947
AS THE CPR A TO TRY AND AND

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.849
ACCOMPLISH THAT SO WHY NOT GO

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.084
AFTER THAT BEHAVIOR.

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.520
INSTEAD OF CREATING A AN

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:26.356
OUTRIGHT EXEMPTION FOR JUST ONE

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:27.457
CLASS OF INFORMATION.

00:55:27.524 --> 00:55:28.958
I DON'T KNOW I GUESS I'D HAVE TO

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.160
SEE KIND OF WHAT THAT WOULD.

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:31.261
WITH A BILL WOULD LOOK LIKE YOU

00:55:31.327 --> 00:55:33.596
KNOW A WE WE WERE BROUGHT A

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:34.264
PROBLEM.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.066
I'M HAVING TO DO WITH THE VERY

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.534
BEGINNINGS OF RESEARCH WITH THE

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.269
SCIENTIST FEELING THEY COULDN'T

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.470
HAVE THE THE BACK AND FORTH THAT

00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:41.938
THEY NEEDED TO HAVE TO EVEN SORT

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:42.839
OF BEGIN.

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:45.008
THE RESEARCH PROCESS AND WE ARE

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:46.943
ALSO VERY MINDFUL OF ALL OF THE

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.311
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE

00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:49.879
DIFFERENT GROUPS SO AGAIN WE ARE

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.481
TRYING TO TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:54.184
OF PRESERVING THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.152
TO KNOW INFORMATION THAT LEGALLY

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:58.021
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO KNOW AND I

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.355
BELIEVE MORALLY THEY'RE ENTITLED.

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:02.692
TO KNOW BUT ALSO -- TO NOT YOU

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:04.494
KNOW TO TO RELIEVE THE PROBLEM

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:05.462
THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.464
RESEARCHERS OF HAVING THE PUBLIC

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:08.932
RECORDS REQUEST BEING USED TO

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:10.500
THE EXTENT THAT THEY CAN'T.

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:12.602
EVEN BEGIN THAT RESEARCH SO

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:13.303
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:16.439
BALANCE -- AND I GUESS I I DON'T

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:17.807
KNOW AND IF YOU HAD OTHER

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.008
LANGUAGE THAT YOU THINK WE

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:19.642
SHOULD LOOK AT I'M HAPPY TO LOOK

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:20.677
AT IT BUT I'M.

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:22.112
NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THAT THE

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:22.679
WOULD LOOK LIKE OKAY WELL

00:56:22.746 --> 00:56:24.047
CERTAINLY COMPLEX PROBLEM BUT

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.081
THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY BLUNT

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:26.249
TOOL IT WOULD BE EASIER TO

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:27.383
SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT MORE

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.752
NARROWLY TARGETED THAT KIND OF

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:29.486
ABUSIVE BEHAVIOUR THAT WE'RE

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.353
DISCUSSING.

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:30.920
YEAH IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:34.157
SUGGESTIONS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:34.791
TO TO HEAR THEM WOULD LOVE TO I

00:56:34.858 --> 00:56:35.658
LOVE TO SIT DOWN AND YOU KNOW

00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:38.161
HEAR MORE OF WHAT YOUR IDEAS ARE

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:42.132
ALL PUT MY THINKING CAP ON THANK

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:44.834
YOU.

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:46.503
WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ISRAEL AS

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:47.403
A SECOND ROOM IS GONZALEZ MISTER

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.305
GALLAGHER.

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.007
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.609
THIS IS HOW I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD

00:56:52.675 --> 00:56:53.510
LEGISLATOR -- SUMMER FRIEDMAN IS

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:54.778
YOU KNOW LAST WEEK WE HAVE.

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:57.113
A BILL UP HERE IN THE VERY SAME

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.680
PEOPLE WHO ARE THEY HERE TO

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.715
SUPPORT IT.

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.350
YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL THIS WEEK

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:02.652
THAT NOW THEY'RE OPPOSED TO IT

00:57:02.719 --> 00:57:04.754
AND SO -- ANYWAYS YOU KNOW THESE

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:06.723
ARE THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.424
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH -- I

00:57:08.491 --> 00:57:11.327
THINK THAT -- THE ISSUE HERE FOR

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:12.862
ME WAS I THINK THE POINT WAS

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.164
MADE VERY WELL BY THE GOOD

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.199
DOCTOR HERE FOR WHY THIS BILL

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.233
SHOULD BE OPPOSED.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.035
BECAUSE IN FACT YOU ARE DOING A

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.904
LOT OF RESEARCH THAT HAS SERIOUS

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.640
IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY.

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.575
IN FACT THESE STUDIES ARE BEING

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:28.678
RELIED UPON. TO PASS LEGISLATION

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:29.813
THAT AFFECTS.

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:32.949
THE ENTIRE PUBLIC -- THESE THESE

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:35.919
FINDINGS -- ARE USED IN MANY

00:57:35.985 --> 00:57:37.720
DIFFERENT AVENUES THAT AFFECT

00:57:37.787 --> 00:57:39.189
THE PUBLIC AND SO.

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:40.757
I DON'T WANT.

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.091
TO I DON'T THINK WE CAN UNDER

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.793
SCORE THIS ENOUGH LIKE IT'S

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.428
IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:47.096
RIGHT TO KNOW.

00:57:47.163 --> 00:57:48.231
ABOUT HOW THESE STUDIES ARE

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:49.532
BEING CONDUCTED ABOUT WHAT

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:52.402
WHAT'S BEHIND THE FINDINGS WHAT

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:54.103
WHAT CORRESPONDENCE.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.072
WAS TAKING PLACE -- BETWEEN

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:59.442
THOSE WHO HAVE A STAKE.

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:04.113
IN THE ISSUE -- AND THOUGH.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.715
I COULD MAYBE SEE THE ISSUE OF

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:06.482
WHY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:09.052
RESEARCH IT IT BECOMES HARASSING

00:58:09.118 --> 00:58:09.586
AND YOU CAN'T COMPLETE THE

00:58:09.652 --> 00:58:12.222
RESEARCH -- THEN MAYBE WHAT

00:58:12.288 --> 00:58:13.590
SHOULD BE DONE THERE IS TO AT

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:14.824
LEAST ALLOW THE RESEARCH TO BE

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.025
COMPLETED AND THEN SOMEONE CAN

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:17.527
AT LEAST MAKE THE REQUEST TO

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.529
FIND OUT.

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:21.197
ABOUT THOSE DOCUMENTS AFTER --

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.765
THE RESEARCH DOCUMENT HAS BEEN

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.767
PUBLISHED BUT NOT TO HAVE A

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:27.570
COMPLETE SHIELD -- YOU KNOW OR

00:58:27.637 --> 00:58:28.938
VERY BROAD SHIELD AND I THINK

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:30.039
THAT'S A PROBLEM OR EVEN WITH

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:32.342
THE AMENDMENTS WHAT WE HAVE HERE

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.810
IS A PRETTY BROAD SHIELD.

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.078
AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER

00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.412
IMPORTANT POINT WAS MADE.

00:58:36.479 --> 00:58:38.915
IS IT THIS IS OFTEN USED BY

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:41.251
PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES -- AND THE

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:42.619
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:44.554
HAVE A GREAT RECORD.

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:46.823
OF YOU KNOW BASICALLY TRYING TO

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.725
PUSH OFF PUBLIC SCRUTINY.

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.226
YOU KNOW AS AS WE ARE LOOKING

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:50.793
INTO SOME OF THE WAYS THAT

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.796
THEY'RE USING PUBLIC FUNDING.

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:54.964
SOME OF THE WAYS THAT THEY'VE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.599
HOARDED MONEY -- IN THE OFFICE

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:58.601
OF THE UNIVERSITY OFFICE OF THE

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:00.637
PRESIDENT FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU

00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.305
KNOW THE THEY SEEM TO

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:04.140
CONTINUALLY WANT.

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.208
TO NOT BE OPEN TO PUBLIC

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:08.144
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY --

00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:10.146
AND HERE NOW ANOTHER INSTANCE

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:12.115
WHERE THEY WANT INTO A SHIELD.

00:59:12.181 --> 00:59:14.450
ESSENTIALLY. FOR THEIR PURPOSES

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.586
FOR US TO NOT LOOK INTO AND FOR

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:18.388
THE PUBLIC TO NOT LOOK INTO --

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:19.956
HOW THEY'RE CONDUCTING SOME OF

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:21.991
THEIR RESEARCH -- AND THAT I

00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:23.359
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.694
NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE AISLE

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:26.763
YOU'RE ON WE WANT TO ENSURE AND

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.998
ESPECIALLY WHERE PUBLIC DOLLARS.

00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:31.067
ARE BEING USE THAT YES WE HAVE A

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:31.868
RIGHT TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE BEING

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:34.037
USED AND HOW THAT RESEARCH IS

00:59:34.103 --> 00:59:37.440
BEING CONDUCTED -- SO. FOR ME I

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:38.875
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS REALLY

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:41.110
NARROW THIS MUCH MORE THAN WHAT

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:43.980
WE'VE GOT TODAY -- AND AND

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.248
REALLY TRY TO TELL AND I THINK

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:46.649
THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN THE

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.418
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT'S KIND

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:51.020
OF OUR JOB -- YOU KNOW THAT IF

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:52.855
IF THERE IS SOME WAY TO HELP

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:54.791
PROTECT AGAINST THE HARASSMENT

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.592
THAT IS IMPEDING AND STOP BEING

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:58.261
GOOD RESEARCH FROM GOING FORWARD.

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.562
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT

00:59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.064
WITHOUT TAKING AWAY THE PUBLIC'S

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.267
RIGHT TO KNOW ULTIMATELY -- HOW

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.336
THAT RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED AND

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:07.937
TO BE ABLE TO SCRUTINIZE IT YOU

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:08.671
KNOW?

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:10.573
THAT'S PART OF THE DEAL TO IS

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.642
NOT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FREE

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:14.510
FROM SCRUTINY -- AND THAT'S KIND

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.112
OF ALWAYS BEEN THE HISTORY OF OF

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:18.314
THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IS THAT

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:19.749
YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING AND

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:21.417
SOMEONE DOWN THE ROAD SAYS WELL

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:21.584
HEY.

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:22.685
YOU MISSED THIS.

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.054
AND AND WE IMPROVE BECAUSE OF

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.856
THAT PUBLIC SCRUTINY -- SO

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:28.358
PUBLIC SCRUTINY IS A GOOD THING

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.193
NOT A BAD THING AND SO BECAUSE

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:31.761
OF THAT I I HAVE TO OPPOSE AND I

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:32.962
WOULD ASK THAT WE WOULD HOLD

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:35.098
THIS IN COMMITTEE -- TO REALLY

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.100
WORK ON THAT AND FINDING THAT

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:40.003
REALLY RIGHT BALLOTS.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.205
THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:45.008
OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.342
AT C. NINE DID JUST BRIEFLY MS

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:49.412
FREEMAN I AM I TOO HAD SOME OF

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.481
THE ISSUES -- WHEN I FIRST READ

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:53.616
THIS THAT AS REYES BY -- MY

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:56.919
COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE IN

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:57.854
FACT IN TO IT.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.889
IT'S ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:01.824
PARTIALLY IN CONFLICT WITH THE

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:02.025
BILL.

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.192
DEPENDING.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.328
WITH A BILL THAT I HAVE --

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.729
HOWEVER I HAVE WORKED WITH YOU

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:07.497
ON A NUMBER OF BILLS IN THE PAST

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.232
I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:12.468
WORKING WITH OPPONENTS -- AND

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:14.070
COMING TO SOME SOLUTION THIS IS

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:17.607
IT THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE -- AND

01:01:17.673 --> 01:01:19.442
CERTAINLY THAT THE VIEW BEHIND

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.910
IT I THINK IS GOOD BUT BUT AS

OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THIS

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:35.558
LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SOME RESERVE

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.126
BUT IT AT LEAST YOU KNOW SOME

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.462
LEVEL OF HEARTBURN OVER IS THIS

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.030

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.098
WORKING WITH WITH EVERYBODY TO

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.867
KIND OF CLARIFY SOME OF THAT.

ALL THE COMMENTS AND ALL OF THE

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.444
OPINIONS -- FROM THE OPPONENTS

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:57.680
OF THE BILL -- AS WELL I JUST

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:58.614
WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:00.116
FIRST OF ALL THE BILL DID NOT

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.751
COME TO US FROM THE UNIVERSITY'S

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:02.318
IT CAME FROM THE SCIENTISTS

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.419
THEMSELVES.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:05.455
WHO FELT THAT THEY WERE HAVING

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.423
TROUBLE LAUNCHING RESEARCH --

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.192
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RECORDS

01:02:09.258 --> 01:02:11.160
REQUEST WAS BEING USED -- AND I

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.129
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WHEN IT

01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.231
COMES -- TO THE METHODS THAT

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.567
WERE USED IN RESEARCH WHAT WAS

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:18.534
DONE ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.902
DISCLOSED BOWL AND STILL IS

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:20.937
UNDER THE BILL.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.138
WE BELIEVE THE THE BILL IS NOT

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.107
IN CONFLICT WITH YOUR BILL --

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.476
AND WE ARE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.543
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT HELPS

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:28.878
ADDRESS A LOT OF THE CONCERNS

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:30.480
FROM PIZZA AND SOME OF THE OTHER

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.682
ANIMAL WELFARE GROUPS -- AND I

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.350
KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY FINE

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:36.319
NEEDLE AND WHEN WE HEAR YOU --

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.887
UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS FROM OUR

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:39.755
PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TELL US THAT

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.157
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DO RESEARCH

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.291
THAT THEIR COLLEAGUES A PRIVATE

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.493
UNIVERSITIES ARE ABLE TO DO.

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.495
IN SOME CASES BECAUSE OF THE WAY

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:47.096
THAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.397
ARE BEING WEAPONIZED THROUGH

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.899
PROCESS ITSELF AND THROUGH

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.067
GETTING INFORMATION THAT PUTS

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.401
THEIR OWN SAFETY SOMETIMES IN

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:53.469
DANGER.

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.138
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.506
THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:58.407
TO DISCUSS AND TO SEE IF WE CAN

01:02:58.474 --> 01:02:59.775
HELP ALLEVIATE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:01.577
I'M ATTEMPTING TO DO AND I KNOW

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:02.645
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.180
THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO KNOW IS SO

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:04.847
IMPORTANT.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.115
BUT THERE'S ALSO PUBLIC BENEFIT

01:03:06.182 --> 01:03:07.450
TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ALLOW

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.852
RESEARCH TO MOVE FORWARD EVEN

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.254
WITH THE PUBLIC.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.156
YOU KNOW GETTING TO UNDERSTAND A

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.590
LOT OF THOSE DETAILS AND SO

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:15.725
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.927
BALANCE AND IF I END UP WITH A

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:19.262
BILL THAT CAN'T BE SUPPORTED BY

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:23.566
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I KNOW

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.200
IT'S A BILL THAT I DON'T WANT TO

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.434
DO -- BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:26.669
FAITH IN SO MANY OF THE CUT MY

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:27.203
COLLEAGUES TO SIT ON THIS

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.837
COMMITTEE AND OTHERS.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.605
SO -- I AM COULDN'T GONNA I'M

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:31.541
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:32.742
THIS BILL IS GOING TO TAKE EXTRA

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:34.343
WORK THIS IS A BILL THAT IS NOT

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.412
AN EASY BILL AND NOT AN EASY FIX

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.246
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:38.748
COMMITTEE STOP WHO GAVE US.

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:41.417
YOU KNOW AMAZINGLY THOUGHT FULL --

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.152
LANGUAGE AND WAYS OF OF REALLY

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.453
TRYING TO FOCUS THIS AND WORK

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.788
COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO DO

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:48.057
THAT BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.425
WANT TO HARM.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.793
THE RIGHTS OF NEWSPAPERS TO KNOW

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.028
TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.730
UNIVERSITIES TO HIDE -- ANY ON

01:03:54.797 --> 01:03:56.032
MISS DOINGS THAT THEY MIGHT DO

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:57.466
OR THEIR PROFESSORS MIGHT DO WE

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.268
UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO

01:03:59.335 --> 01:03:59.869
CONCERT ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:05.875
HAVE A A REAL -- YOU KNOW --

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:06.709
THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.277
WHEN RESEARCH IS GOING TO TO

01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:09.912
BECOME IT IN ALL TO HAPPEN AND

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.214
AND HOUSE A LOT OF THAT RESEARCH

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.815
IS DONE SO WE THINK THAT THERE.

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:15.084
IS A SWEET SPOT THAT WE CAN FIND.

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:15.985
AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:17.954
CONTINUING TO WORK ON AND WHEN

01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.921

DIDN'T FEEL WE GOT THERE.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.493
I FIND THAT COMFORTING MYSELF

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.695
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE MY

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.662

01:04:26.729 --> 01:04:28.030
THAT THAT DOES THE KIND OF HARM

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.532
THAT I THINK THAT THE OPPONENTS

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.166

TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AS I DID

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:57.132
LAST YEAR WHEN YOU HAD THE BILL --

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.500
BEFORE BEFORE US -- FOR THE

01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.134
REASONS THAT YOU KIND OF ARE

HOUSTON.

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:04.006
AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING -- AND

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.607
HOLDING UP SOMEONE'S IMMIGRATION

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:08.710
DOCUMENTS ALSO MIR'S FEDERAL LAW.

ABOUT A BY FARM BUREAU BUT ALSO

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:15.984

MATTERS OF APARTMENTS ACCEPTED

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:25.060
TO WEAR MAY WORK ON THAT SO THAT --

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.895
OBVIOUSLY IN THOSE CASES SOMEONE

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.664
DOES NEED TO LIVE THERE.

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:32.067
IN ORDER TO DO THE JOB -- AND

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:32.868

01:25:09.537 --> 01:25:10.772
THIS WILL BE MY LAST POINT IS

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.307
DOJ HAS A LOT OF THINGS AND HE'S

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:14.108
A FOCUS ON GETTING GUNS OUT OF

01:25:14.175 --> 01:25:15.310
THE HANDS OF FELONS AND OTHER

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:16.778
PROHIBITED PERSONS THAT

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.046

OTHER WEEK RIGHT WAITING BACK

01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:31.960
QUITE A BIT OFF THEIR TOPIC OF

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:32.794
THE THE POINT BEING THERE'S SOME

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:33.428
REALLY IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.096
THE DOJ AND I DON'T THINK ADDING

01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:35.563
THEM.

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:37.565

THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION

FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH OTHER

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:56.803
MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE OLDER

CRIME ACT.

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:02.108
THIS IS VERY RELEVANT BECAUSE

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:03.643
FEDERAL FUNDING IS BOTH

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:05.845

01:58:28.134 --> 01:58:29.435
EVERY FUNDING SOURCE COMES WITH

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.103

IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA TO STEP

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.329

02:01:54.206 --> 02:01:54.874
WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.042
DIVERSIFYING THE BENCH IN THE

02:01:56.108 --> 02:01:58.711
BAR AND ALL OF THAT ENTAILS THIS

02:01:58.778 --> 02:02:00.179
TO ME IS A PIECE OF THAT AND

02:02:00.246 --> 02:02:02.281
THAT'S WHY IT'S FINE WITH ME

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:03.115
THAT WERE MOVING THIS OUTSIDE

02:02:03.182 --> 02:02:04.483
THE BAR DUES BILL?

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:06.452
I THINK THIS NEEDS ITS OWN

02:02:06.519 --> 02:02:08.988
SPOTLIGHT A LITTLE BIT AND I AM

02:02:09.055 --> 02:02:09.755
HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL PASS IT

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:10.289
HERE.

02:02:10.356 --> 02:02:12.158
SEND THIS OFF TO THE SENATE WHO

02:02:12.224 --> 02:02:13.492
WILL TAKE THIS AS SERIOUSLY

02:02:13.559 --> 02:02:15.361
BECAUSE THIS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:16.395
FOR ALL OF US.

02:02:16.462 --> 02:02:19.432
SO WITH THAT OTHER QUESTIONS

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:23.202
COMMON BUSINESS HOURS.

02:02:23.269 --> 02:02:24.670
I'M IN THE MISTER CHIU.

02:02:24.737 --> 02:02:25.905
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO NOT SUPPORT

02:02:25.971 --> 02:02:26.739
THIS BILL TODAY AND AND I HAVE

02:02:26.806 --> 02:02:27.373
TO TELL YOU WHY -- THERE IS A

02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:30.810
HUGE DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT

02:02:30.876 --> 02:02:32.011
ATTORNEYS TO IN THE STATE.

02:02:32.078 --> 02:02:35.181
AND IT SEEMS -- LIKE A AT FEET

02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:36.782
THAT IS APPLIED TO EVERY

02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:37.750
ATTORNEY.

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:39.351
EVEN THOSE PROVIDING THE VERY

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:40.953
SERVICES WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:43.456
FUNDING WHO AREN'T NEARLY PAID

02:02:43.522 --> 02:02:44.623
THE SAME.

02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:46.425
AS LIKE THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:47.827
ATTORNEYS ARE MAKING.

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:50.396
AN AS AN EXAMPLE TO IF IF YOU

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:53.099
ARE -- EITHER I THEIR SOLE

02:02:53.165 --> 02:02:54.600
PROPRIETOR YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE

02:02:54.667 --> 02:02:56.168
SERVING -- ALONE CAN COMMUNITY

02:02:56.235 --> 02:02:57.703
LIKE MINE OR YOU'RE DOING LEGAL

02:02:57.770 --> 02:03:01.173
AID OR A VARIETY OF OTHER THINGS

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:02.341
IN YOUR PAYING YOUR OWN.

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:03.976
JUICE IF YOU WORK FOR A LARGE

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:05.244
FIRM.

02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:06.712
THE FIRM IS PAYING YOUR DUES IN

02:03:06.779 --> 02:03:08.114
THIS FORTY DOLLARS DOES NOT

02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:08.914
MATTER.

02:03:08.981 --> 02:03:10.950
SO THE ACROSS THE BOARD FORTY

02:03:11.016 --> 02:03:11.684
DOLLARS.

02:03:11.751 --> 02:03:14.687
I THINK.

02:03:14.754 --> 02:03:16.555
WHAT I WOULD PREFER TO SEE IS A

02:03:16.622 --> 02:03:18.891
LARGER INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT

02:03:18.958 --> 02:03:20.693
THAT -- LARGE FIRMS THAT ARE

02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:22.394
PROVIDING THE PRO BONO SERVICES

02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:23.362
THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING

02:03:23.429 --> 02:03:24.964
ANYWAY BUT THAT THE LARGE FIRMS

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:26.565
WERE PAIN FOR CORPORATE CHINESE

02:03:26.632 --> 02:03:27.299
WHO.

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:29.168
WHO MAKE THIS MUCH IN AN HOUR?

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:31.904
RIGHT -- CAN SHOULDER AND THAT

02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:33.339
WE'RE NOT HURTING THE VERY LEGAL

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:36.275
PROVIDERS WHO ARE DOING IT FOR

02:03:36.342 --> 02:03:37.943
FOR VERY LITTLE NOT THIS IDEA

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:40.212
THAT ALL ATTORNEYS ARE WEALTHY.

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:42.414
IS WRONG RIGHT ALL ATTORNEYS

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:44.383
CAN'T AFFORD THIS -- I ALSO AM

02:03:44.450 --> 02:03:47.486
OPPOSED TO ADDING IT TO THE FEE

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:48.954
FOR INACTIVE ATTORNEYS --

02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:51.323
BECAUSE HAVING GONE THROUGH IT

02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:52.324
APPEARED OF TIME WHEN I WAS IN

02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:53.459
AN ACTIVE ATTORNEY BECAUSE I WAS

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:55.761
NOT PRACTICING LAW IN THE ONLY

02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:56.662

INACTIVE YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING

02:04:02.802 --> 02:04:05.971
IT WILL IN VERY FEW PROFESSIONS

DO YOU PAY. FOR SOMETHING YOU'VE

02:04:07.606 --> 02:04:08.174
ALREADY PAID FOR BY THE WAY PAID

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.275

02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:22.888
OTHERS ARE IN MUCH BETTER

02:04:22.955 --> 02:04:25.424
SITUATION TO PAY FOR EXAMPLE IF

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.226
YOU'RE A A MOM WHO IS NOT

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:42.641
REGRESSIVE.

02:04:42.708 --> 02:04:44.009
AND ACTUALLY COULD BRING IN MORE

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:46.512

02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:07.266
PROMINENT CHAIR PERSON IN THIS

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.668
HOUSE -- THIS IS A PROCESS OF

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:11.537
COMPROMISE I'VE BEEN BEFORE THIS

BUT I'VE BEEN BEFORE BEFORE THE

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:18.944
COMMITTEE. FOR THREE YEARS

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:20.145
WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

02:05:20.212 --> 02:05:21.580
CHAIRMAN ON A VARIETY OF IDEAS --

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:24.583
THE GENESIS OF THIS AND I HAD A

02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:25.985
A CONVERSATION SIDEBAR

02:05:26.051 --> 02:05:27.419
CONVERSATION WITH MY COLLEAGUE

02:05:27.486 --> 02:05:29.555
FROM SAM CISCO WHO HAD INQUIRED

02:05:29.622 --> 02:05:31.390
ON MY INTEREST ON THE UBJECTS

02:05:31.457 --> 02:05:33.025
OF WALKED.

02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:34.293
COME FROM OBVIOUSLY A VERY.

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.028
A RURAL COMMUNITY -- WAS SOME OF

02:05:36.095 --> 02:05:38.864
THE HIGHEST POVERTY -- IN IN THE

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:40.633
STATE AND IN THE COUNTRY.

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:44.203
AND I AM A DEVOUT -- CASE WORKER --

02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:45.971
WITH MY HISTORY WITH MY OFFICE

02:05:46.038 --> 02:05:47.273
AND AND THIS INSTITUTION I THINK

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:48.540
THE WORK WE DO WITH OUR

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:50.009
CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME IS.

02:05:50.075 --> 02:05:52.444
PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE

02:05:52.511 --> 02:05:53.345
NEW LAWS THAT WE PUT ON THE

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:54.413
BOOKS.

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.881
AND IN THAT.

02:05:55.948 --> 02:05:57.516
EFFORT TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN THE

02:05:57.583 --> 02:05:59.218
COMMUNITY -- NUMEROUS TIMES OVER

02:05:59.285 --> 02:06:01.387
THE COURSE PAST SEVEN YEARS I'VE

02:06:01.453 --> 02:06:03.355
COME ACROSS -- CIRCUMSTANCES

02:06:03.422 --> 02:06:04.757
WHERE WE NEED LEGAL HELP AND WE

02:06:04.823 --> 02:06:06.458
WENT TO THE LOCAL LEGAL AID AND

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:08.327
IT WAS -- EXTRAORDINARILY

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:10.129
INADEQUATE.

02:06:10.195 --> 02:06:11.363
DEL WELL YOU REPRESENT A

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.232
DISTRICT -- VERY SIMILAR TO MINE --

02:06:13.299 --> 02:06:16.135
DEMOGRAPHICALLY YOU ALSO.

02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:17.736
YOUR DISTRICT HAS THE BENEFIT OF

02:06:17.803 --> 02:06:20.205
BEING VERY CLOSE TO A RICH URBAN

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:21.507
AREA.

02:06:21.573 --> 02:06:23.609
WITH A LOT OF GUILTY LIBERALS IN

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:25.244
THE ATTORNEY PROFESSION WHO LIKE

02:06:25.311 --> 02:06:27.212
TO WRITE BIG CHECKS AND GO TO

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:29.648
BIG FUNDRAISERS FOR LEGAL AID WE

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:30.015
DON'T.

02:06:30.082 --> 02:06:32.384
HAVE THAT IN MY DISTRICT OR

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:35.754
MISTER GALLAGHER'S DISTRICT --

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:37.790
THEREFORE THERE SET BY A

02:06:37.856 --> 02:06:39.892
DISPROPORTIONATE PROBLEM HERE

02:06:39.959 --> 02:06:41.226
THAT EXISTS IN RURAL CALIFORNIA.

02:06:41.293 --> 02:06:43.262
MY ORIGINAL THOUGHT WAS TO LOOK

02:06:43.329 --> 02:06:44.863
TO THE BAR ITSELF.

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:47.733
AND NOTE THAT I I THINK THE BAR

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:49.201
RECOMMENDS FIFTY HOURS.

02:06:49.268 --> 02:06:51.637
OF PRO BONO FOR ALL ATTORNEYS I

02:06:51.704 --> 02:06:53.038
THINK THAT'S WHAT'S CURRENT --

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:54.239
LEE THE RECOMMENDATION OF THAT'S

02:06:54.306 --> 02:06:56.342
NOT MANDATORY THAT'S A VOLUNTARY

02:06:56.408 --> 02:06:58.410
RECOMMENDATION -- AND I AND SO

02:06:58.477 --> 02:06:59.678
MY FIRST EFFORT IN THIS IS A ONE

02:06:59.745 --> 02:07:02.081

02:07:02.147 --> 02:07:02.614

02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:05.150
AND MAKE IT MANDATORY EVERY

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:07.753
ATTORNEY HAS TO DO TWENTY FIVE

02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:08.354
HOURS OF PRO BONO [inaudible]

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:12.091
OR PAY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS INTO

02:07:12.157 --> 02:07:12.858
A FUND THAT WAS MY ORIGINAL

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:16.061
PROPOSAL AND IN THAT PROPOSAL --

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:19.031

02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:57.836
IT IS THE PROXIMITY TO WEALTHY

02:07:57.903 --> 02:08:00.639
FIRMS THAT DO A LOT OF GIVING

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.341
THAT CAN MAKE THOSE URBAN LEGAL

AID ORGANIZATIONS IN A BETTER

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:05.477

VERY CLEAR LEGAL AID IN MY

HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

02:08:58.864 --> 02:08:59.498

DOLLARS A YEAR SO -- I JUST

02:09:02.534 --> 02:09:03.802
WANNA MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND

02:09:03.869 --> 02:09:06.105
THAT THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS NOT

02:09:06.171 --> 02:09:08.140
A AS I SUPPOSE THE STEREO

02:09:08.207 --> 02:09:09.241
TYPICAL [inaudible]

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:11.043
FIRM.

I HAVE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE AND WANT

02:09:15.681 --> 02:09:17.950
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ENGAGE.

02:09:18.016 --> 02:09:21.286
IN LEGAL WORK THAT IS OUTSIDE OF

02:09:21.353 --> 02:09:22.788
CORPORATE LAW IF YOU WELL.

02:09:22.855 --> 02:09:25.357

HURT PEOPLE IN THAT POSITION --

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.628
ADDITIONALLY I ALREADY THINK THE

02:09:29.695 --> 02:09:32.498
BARGES I MEAN ARE EXTREMELY HIGH.

02:09:32.564 --> 02:09:34.433
IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY ONEROUS --

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:37.469
AND QUITE FRANKLY I IT I

02:09:37.536 --> 02:09:38.070
ANTICIPATE THEY'LL BE GOING UP

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:39.872
THIS YEAR.

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.440

ATTACH ADDITIONAL -- COST ON TO

02:09:59.124 --> 02:10:01.827

SOMETHING -- IF WE COULD

02:10:30.722 --> 02:10:31.790

ATTORNEY AND I DO HOPE THAT THIS

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:56.034
IS A COMMITTEE THAT AT SOME

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:57.436
POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE WILL

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:58.503

JUST END WITH ONE POINT WHICH IS

02:13:07.679 --> 02:13:09.081
I DO HAVE -- ONE MY ONLY CONCERN

02:13:09.147 --> 02:13:10.582
ABOUT THIS BILL IT IT IS IS BY

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:12.017
NO MEANS ENOUGH.

02:13:12.084 --> 02:13:14.386
THIS BILL WILL HOPEFULLY BRING

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:15.954
THREE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:18.357
ADDITIONAL REVENUES AND THAT IS

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:19.057
WHAT.

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:21.226
THE THE THE SMALL PRO BONO

02:13:21.293 --> 02:13:22.894
CONTRIBUTIONS OF OUR LARGEST LAW

02:13:22.961 --> 02:13:25.530
FIRMS ARE. FORTY DOLLARS IS AS

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:27.299
MR CAR AND I WERE JUST TALKING

02:13:27.366 --> 02:13:29.301
ABOUT REPRESENTS ABOUT SIX

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:30.268
MINUTES OF WORK FOR YOUR AVERAGE

02:13:30.335 --> 02:13:31.570
BIG FROM ATTORNEY.

02:13:31.636 --> 02:13:33.538
AND EVEN TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE

02:13:33.605 --> 02:13:35.340
HOURS THAT REFLECTS AS I JUST TO

02:13:35.407 --> 02:13:37.709
THE CALCULATION 122% OF THE TIME

02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:39.244
A BREAK FROM ATTORNEYS.

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:42.948
AND SO THE REALITY IS -- 90%

02:13:43.014 --> 02:13:45.050
BALL TOURNEY'S WORK FOR THE TOP

02:13:45.117 --> 02:13:46.918
10% OF AMERICA.

02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:48.854
WHICH MEANS THAT -- 10% WILL

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.389
TOURNEY'S REPRESENTS EVERYONE

02:13:50.455 --> 02:13:51.723
ELSE AND THAT'S JUST NOT A

02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:53.992
SITUATION THAT IS TERRIBLE SO.

02:13:54.059 --> 02:13:56.428
I HOPE THAT WE WILL MOVE THIS

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:57.028
FOR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:13:57.095 --> 02:13:58.163
MOVE THIS.

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.331
LEGISLATION FOR TO KEEP THE

02:13:59.398 --> 02:14:02.501
CONVERSATION GOING I DO HOPE IF

02:14:02.567 --> 02:14:03.168
THIS PASSES WE CAN KEEP BUILDING

02:14:03.235 --> 02:14:05.137
ON IT -- BECAUSE WE ARE BY NO

02:14:05.203 --> 02:14:06.938
MEANS DONE IN ENSURING THAT WE

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:11.510
HAVE TO JUSTICE AND AMERICA.

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:12.577
SO I THINK THAT IS A MOTION.

02:14:12.644 --> 02:14:14.913
IS THERE A SECOND AND THE SECOND

02:14:34.833 --> 02:14:36.234
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY

02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:37.369
OUR STAFF.

02:14:37.436 --> 02:14:39.638

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:46.111
MEMBERS.

02:14:46.178 --> 02:14:48.513
AND THEN FOR FINDING OUT HOW WE

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:49.881
INCREASE THE FEES FOR SOME OF

02:14:49.948 --> 02:14:51.383
THE OTHERS WHO CAN ABSOLUTELY

02:14:51.450 --> 02:14:53.852
AFFORD IT -- BUT I THANK YOU FOR

BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK

02:14:55.687 --> 02:14:56.621
YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR SEPARATING

02:14:56.688 --> 02:14:58.056
THIS FROM EVERYTHING ELSE

02:14:58.123 --> 02:15:00.792
RELATED TO BAR DUES I THINK THIS

02:15:00.859 --> 02:15:03.261
ONE DESERVES ITS OWN BILL

02:15:03.328 --> 02:15:03.562
[inaudible]

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:05.597
THIS GALLAGHER.

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:08.099
OF MR GREY'S AS AS TEMPTING AS

02:15:08.166 --> 02:15:10.836
WEALTHIEST REDISTRIBUTION IS

02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:14.673
INVOLVING INTERNEES -- AND CRABS

02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:16.341
ATTACKS AGAINST ATTORNEYS MIGHT

02:15:16.408 --> 02:15:18.176
BE SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:19.945
PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

02:15:20.011 --> 02:15:20.512
I DO HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:22.214
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO THAT

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.315
YOU KNOW NOT ALL ATTORNEYS OR

02:15:23.381 --> 02:15:25.450
ARE THE SAME WE CAN ALL BE PROP

02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:26.852
SIXTY FIVE ATTORNEYS.

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:28.420
AND GET THOSE BIG ATTORNEY FEES

02:15:28.487 --> 02:15:32.557
AWARDS -- AND LOOK I I I DO WANT

02:15:32.624 --> 02:15:33.925
TO SEE AFTER LOOKING AT THIS AND

02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:35.527
AND LOOKING AT MY OWN COMMUNITY

02:15:35.594 --> 02:15:37.996
I I DO SEE THAT.

02:15:38.063 --> 02:15:39.931
THIS ISN'T AS BIG OF A PROBLEM

02:15:39.998 --> 02:15:43.101
BECAUSE ACTUALLY 70% OF

02:15:43.168 --> 02:15:45.370
ATTORNEYS CHECK THE BOX -- TO

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:47.005
GIVE TO LEGAL AID IN THIS IN

02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:48.473
THIS STATE SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:49.841
MONEY THAT PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY

02:15:49.908 --> 02:15:51.743
SAY YES I WILL AND IN MY OWN

02:15:51.810 --> 02:15:52.978
COMMUNITY WE HAVE.

02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:55.714
LEGAL AID PROGRAMS THAT A LOT OF

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.649
PEOPLE GET TOGETHER WE HAVE A

02:15:57.716 --> 02:15:59.451
FUNDRAISER EVERY YEAR.

02:15:59.518 --> 02:16:01.152
FOR SO THERE IS A LOT I MEAN

02:16:01.219 --> 02:16:02.420
MAYBE IT'S NOT EVERY COMMUNITY

02:16:02.487 --> 02:16:03.688
BUT I I'VE I PERSONALLY SEE A

02:16:03.755 --> 02:16:06.791
LOT OF A VOLUNTARY SUPPORT GOING

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:07.459
THERE THERE'S SOME GREAT

02:16:07.526 --> 02:16:09.494
ORGANIZATIONS DOING THIS WORK.

02:16:09.561 --> 02:16:11.062
AND SO I I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:16:11.129 --> 02:16:13.164
MAKING IT MANDATORY IS REALLY

02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:15.166
NECESSARY AT THIS TIME SO.

02:16:15.233 --> 02:16:17.035
CAN'T SUPPORTED TODAY I I DO

02:16:17.102 --> 02:16:19.571
APPRECIATE -- WHERE THAT IS

02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:20.805
COMING FROM THE -- FROM YOU AND

02:16:20.872 --> 02:16:25.443
AND YOUR INTENT BEHIND THE BILL.

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:27.445
NO ONE ELSE ALL RIGHT SO MEMBERS

02:16:27.512 --> 02:16:29.114
WHAT WOULD ASKS I'M HOPING THAT

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:30.649
THIS WILL PASS HERE TODAY AND I

02:16:30.715 --> 02:16:31.883
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:33.351
SIMPLISTIC LOOK AT IT BUT IT'S A

02:16:33.418 --> 02:16:35.086
SMALL AMOUNT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

02:16:35.153 --> 02:16:36.421
AT THE BIG PICTURE.

02:16:36.488 --> 02:16:37.522
HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW IN THE

02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:39.958
SENATE WORKING OUR WAY IS THE

02:16:40.025 --> 02:16:41.159
BAR DUES BILL.

02:16:41.226 --> 02:16:43.395
AND THE BAR IS ASKING FOR A

02:16:43.461 --> 02:16:45.063
SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF MONEY THIS

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:47.732
IS I THINK IF WE'RE CLEAR.

02:16:47.799 --> 02:16:49.634
OUR OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SOME OF

02:16:49.701 --> 02:16:50.936
THE REGRESSIVE NATURE OF THAT

02:16:51.002 --> 02:16:52.804
FEE STRUCTURE OUT AND STILL

02:16:52.871 --> 02:16:55.206
ALLOWING THE BAR. TO RAISE THE

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:57.375
MONEY THAT IT NEEDS TO OPERATE

02:16:57.442 --> 02:16:58.944
ALTHOUGH THEY I WILL ADMIT THEY

02:16:59.010 --> 02:17:00.312
STILL HAVE TO PROVE AND

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:01.646
ESTABLISHED.

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:03.148
THAT NEED I WOULD THINK.

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:04.816
THAT'S WHERE WE COULD HAVE THE

02:17:04.883 --> 02:17:06.751
BIGGEST EFFECT ON ATTORNEYS WHO

02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:09.588
ARE AT THE LOW END OF THE THE

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:10.655
WAGE SCALE BECAUSE NOT ALL THE

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:11.790
TREES ARE MAKING.

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:13.558
AS MUCH MONEY AND ESPECIALLY

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:14.993
THOSE ATTORNEYS WHERE THOSE

02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:16.127
FIRMS ARE VERY LARGE AND

02:17:16.194 --> 02:17:17.529
EXPENSIVE IN THE FIRM'S PAY FOR

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:18.797
THE FEES ANYWAY.

02:17:18.863 --> 02:17:21.032
I THINK THERE'S SHOULD BE A LACK

02:17:21.099 --> 02:17:23.001
OF SYMPATHY. TO THE THE BURDEN

02:17:23.068 --> 02:17:24.369
THAT THAT PROVIDES.

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:26.771
SO I'M HOPING WE CAN MOVE THIS

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.173
AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO MR

02:17:28.239 --> 02:17:29.874
GRAY AND AND WORK THIS THROUGH

02:17:29.941 --> 02:17:31.343
THAT'S FINE.

02:17:31.409 --> 02:17:32.410
BUT I WILL POINT OUT OUR

02:17:32.477 --> 02:17:34.879
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE BIGGEST

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:36.481
DENT IN THIS IS AS THE BAR DUES.

02:17:36.548 --> 02:17:38.183
