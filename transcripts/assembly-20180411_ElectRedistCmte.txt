I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEE FIRST OF ALL FOR ALL THE WORK GETS DONE I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY RECOMMENDED AND I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THEM TODAY. THE LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO PROTECT PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY FROM HARASSMENT AND HOLD. TRADERS ACCOUNTABLE SCOPE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT EXPANDS BEYOND THE LEGISLATURE AND WE HAVE A DUTY PROTECT. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. WE LEARN IN OCTOBER HOW WOMEN AND MEN HAVE SPOKEN UP. A THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE A COUPLE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE CULTURE OF ENABLING HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT AND IT IS A TIME TO ENSURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY ARE PROTECTED. AYE ASPIRIN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER LEVINE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING. WHERE THEY? MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME'S KRISTY BAUM I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATE. WE OUR OF VOLUNTARY NONPARTISAN ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING PROFESSIONAL LOBBYISTS IN CALIFORNIA. A WE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR BOARD ABOUT THIS ISSUE. NO WAY PRECEDING THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL. LAST FALL AS THIS. IF YOU CAME TO LIGHT I ACTUALLY PERSONALLY WAS A SIGNER. ON THE LETTER WE SAID ENOUGH. A I EMBRACE THE SPIRIT. OR AT LEAST MY OF PRESUME SPIRIT OF THE AUTHOR'S INTENT. TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE VICTIMS OF WHAT HAS GONE ON IN THIS CAPITOL BUILDING IN THIS COMMUNITY. A UNFORTUNATELY THE AJ WHILE THAT HAS BEEN VERY PROACTIVE. IN A MEETING WITH ITS MEMBERS HOLDING. A WE ISSUE A PRESS RELEASE VERY EARLY ON IN OCTOBER SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS THE OBLIGATION RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. A TO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. A WE SPONSORED A DAY OF RESOURCES A MONTH AND A HALF AGO INVITING EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY TO COME LISTEN TO ATTORNEYS. TO UNDERSTAND VICTIMS RIGHTS TO LISTEN TO HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EMPLOYER OBLIGATIONS ARE AS MANY OF MY MEMBERS. EMPLOY. A. SMITH STAFF OTHER LOBBYIST THAT CETERA. A IT'S IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE STRUCTURE IS NOW? AND WHAT WE ARE SUBJECT TO AND HOW TO RESPOND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE AND OUR OWN FIRMS. PRESENT A SAFE WORKPLACE BUT ALSO. A AS WE EXTEND OURSELVES OUTSIDE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND INTO THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY. TO PROMOTE A SAFE WORK WORKPLACE AND WE ARE UNWAVERING IN THAT COMMITMENT. UNFORTUNATELY WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL IS A LITTLE PUNITIVE. A LITTLE TARGETED. A TWO ONE ONE CATEGORY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THIS COMMUNITY. AND MAYBE THAT FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION WHICH THE A. ANALYSIS CLEARLY POINTS OUT MIGHT NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE BODY TO ADJUDICATE ALLEGATIONS ALLEGATIONS SUCH AS THIS. AND AS YOU KNOW WE ARE JUST PROFESSIONALS EXERCISING WHAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. OF FREE SPEECH AND TO ADDRESS THE ELECTED'S THE REDRESS OUR GOVERNMENT ABOUT CONCERNS. SO SUGGESTING THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN BE BANNED FROM EXERCISING. THIS. A. CONSTITUTIONAL GIVEN RIGHT. BUT IS TROUBLING SO WE. WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS. BILL OF. MAYBE NOT JUST BE APPENDED WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT WE WANT TO WORK AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN SHY ABOUT EXPRESSING THEIR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS AND AVAILABILITY. TO BE COLLABORATIVE ON A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION RATHER THAN WHAT FEELS LIKE. A TARGET SHOTS SO AND FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS MEASURE THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. LIAM IS BAMA. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ALL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BUT HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I OF COURSE THE. THE THE BARE BONES ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE IS THAT THIS BILL PROHIBITS LOBBYIST LOBBYING FIRMS FROM GAUGING HER SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS DEFINED IN AUTHORIZES THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION IS TO SPEND A LOBBYIST FOR THE VIOLATION THIS RULE. FOR UP TO FOUR YEARS I I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS CAN BE AMENDMENTS BE CLARIFIED ON IF THEY. ATTACK THIS SIDE OF THE CENTRAL ISSUE OR WHAT WHAT WERE THE AMENDMENTS THAT SO THE AMENDMENTS ESSENTIALLY IN AND BE GLAD FOR FOR THE CHARITY EVEN TALK ABOUT THEM BUT. IT TAKES AWAY THAT FOUR YEAR REVOCATION PART OF THE LANGUAGE AND ALLOWS FOR. PENALTIES THAT THE WHICH CAME BODY WOULD DETERMINE UP MUCH AS THEY DO RIGHT NOW ALREADY FOR PENALTIES THAT DAY. DETERMINE. IN ANY FINDINGS. SO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO BAN ON SPEECH. SUTURE CLARIFY WHICH WHICH IS THE BODY THAT SO RIGHT NOW IN THE LANGUAGE IT IS THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT MUCH LIKE THIS COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AREA OF CODE. I DO. UNDERSTAND FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FORTHCOMING COMMITTEE AT THE JUDICIARY THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER CHANGES TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. THE LOBBYISTS HAVE ABOUT BEING REGULATED. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REGULATE THAT INDUSTRY AND. AND I'M OPEN MINDED TO IT BUT I'VE ALSO BEEN OPEN MINDED. TO THE LOBBYISTS IDEAS THEY HAVE NOT PUT FORTH AMENDMENTS OF THEIR OWN. AND THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO TO INCLUDE ANY OTHER THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATIONS ON IN AS IN THE BILL AS IT GOES FORWARD. MISTER CHAIR BUT IF I COULD NOT ON. THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE SITE KNOWLEDGE THE. THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THE NEED TO BE. FIVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STEPPED UP IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TACKLE THE ISSUE THE CONCERN I HAVE. IS THE EQUAL PROTECTION ISSUE THAT ONE PROFESSION IS BEING SINGLED OUT AND AND ALSO THAT THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES. COMMISSION MAY NOT BE THE BEST. DETERMINANT OF A OF THIS KIND OF AN ISSUE UP BECAUSE. THERE ARE MANY LICENSED I PROFESSIONS BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN SO WHY SHOULD THIS PARTICULAR PROFESSION BE SINGLED OUT VERSES REALTORS DOCTORS DENNIS OR. I'D ENGINEERS OR ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY HAVE A LICENSED. SITUATION MAY HAVE A LICENSE IN JEOPARDY OR SHOULD THE DEPARTMENT REAL ESTATE BE REGULATING REALTORS. I JUST DON'T SEE THAT THE CONNECTION OR THE NEXUS. ON THIS ISSUE AND I SO I THINK THAT A A MORE COMPREHENSIVE BILL. THAT TACKLES THE ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD AYE IS MORE APPROPRIATE I THINK. THEN NOW AND THEN. TACKLING THIS A BY PUTTING THE FPP SEE IN CHARGE THIS WHICH I THINK MAYBE A MISPLACED AGENTS. MISTER HARPER LOOK FOR TO CONSIDERING YOUR PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THEMES HARBOR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS HAVE A QUESTION THAT WEBER. THE SONG OKAY SO NO LIGHT. UP TO ABSENT OF THE IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS BILL. WHAT WOULD THAT HAPPEN I MEAN I I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT? AND WHETHER NOT. WE'VE GOT THIS HERE. IF THIS DIDN'T EXIST OF WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS A PERSON OF SAID THEY WERE BEING. SEXUALLY HARASSED AND MAY HAPPEN TO BEEN LOBBYIST WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS FOR THEM AT THAT TIME AT OCTOBER THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION THERE ISN'T ONE. RIGHT NOW. THERE'S NOWHERE TO TO GO TO IT TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERPETRATING. A CRIME LIKE THIS SORT OF MAKES ONE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE WORKPLACE I'VE HAD. PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKED IN THIS BUILDING FOR YEARS COME TO ME AND TELL ME STORIES ABOUT HOW THERE WOULD BE A LOBBYIST WHO WOULD COME INTO THE OFFICE AND WOULD MAKE. A YOUNG WOMAN IN THEIR OFFICE. CAN SO NERVOUS SHE WOULD PHYSICALLY SHAKE EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT HE CAME IN THERE. AND THAT CHIEF OF STAFF HAD TO GO AND CALL THAT LOBBYIST AND TELL HIM. TO WATCH HIS BEHAVIOR WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE INTO THE OFFICE. AND THAT THERE IS NO WHERE TO. TO YOU KNOW HOW THIS BE RECORDED ON A RECORD OF THAT PERSON'S LOBBYING. I'VE HAD. YOU BIT THE GENESIS REALLY OF THIS BILL ITSELF WAS THE LETTER THAT KICKED OFF THIS LOOK AT THE CAPITOL CULTURE AS IT'S BEEN CALLED WHICH WAS ABOUT LOBBYIST ON LOBBYIST SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND THAT THERE WAS REALLY NO WHERE TO GO. AND I I THINK THAT IF WE LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING SPECIFICALLY. WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH AND WE HAVEN'T DONE EVERYTHING YET. ON BUT WE HAVE TAKEN IT VERY SERIOUSLY HOW WE CLEAN THIS PLACE UP AND I SPEAK FROM A PLACE OF PRIVILEGE I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS. MYSELF BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE. BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP IN THAT ORIGINAL LETTER A THIS BILL IS TO SAY EVERYONE IN THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY DESERVES PROTECTION. NOT JUST A. MEMBERS AND STAFF IN AND HOW THAT INTERVIEW THAT INTERACTION OCCURS IN HERE. THE FACT THAT. MEMBERS AND STAFF HAVE ALSO HAD THESE. INTERACTIONS THE IN INVOLVING SEXUAL HARASSMENT WITH LOBBYISTS AND. IT IN AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT SOMEHOW THIS BILL ISN'T. IN ITS FINAL FORM THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS WE HAVE TO PROTECT EVERYBODY. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BOB BUREAU. AND THE TREASURE OF AYE GA AND I'D. LIKE TO CLARIFY. DOCTOR WEBBER'S QUESTION. DIDN'T MISTER LEVINE'S ANSWER. CURRENTLY. ANY MEMBER ANY STAFF MEMBER CAN FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE ETHICS COMMITTEE ANY TO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE SENATOR THE JOINT ETHICS COMMITTEE. MAKE A COMPLAINT CAN BE FILED WITH THE RULES COMMITTEE. WE ARE REGULATED BY THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION AND AS SUCH WE HAVE TO TAKE. LOBBYING A ETHICS COURSES EVERY TWO YEARS WHICH INCLUDE THE SAME SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING THAT THE MEMBERS AND THE STAFF TAKE. SO WE ALREADY ABIDE BY THOSE RULES DOCTOR WEBER. AND WE ALSO HAVE TO FACE THE DEATH THINKS COMMITTEE OF THERE'S A COUPLE EIGHT FILED A NO COULD THE INTERNAL RULES BE MODIFIED AS THE SENATE IN THE ASSEMBLY ARE WORKING ON ABSOLUTELY TO STRENGTHEN THOSE. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE AS AN ORGANIZATION BELIEVE THAT THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT SHOULD BE AMENDED TO HAND THIS OVER TO REGULATORY AGENCY THAT IN A SENSE REGULATES OUR FILINGS AND OR LOBBYING ACTIVITY. OKAY I. OUT. IN I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT AYE ARE PROBABLY WILL SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DOES. YEAH I I HAVE A. LIKE THIS I HAVE A REAL CONCERN IS AB EXPRESSED EVEN WITH ALL pOCCURRED. THAT SOMETIMES IN OUR EFFORTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. OF WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO RUN OVER ALL OF THE FOLKS RIGHTS OR. OR MORE IMPORTANTLY RESTED RUSTED DECISIONS THAT PROBABLY IF FOUGHT IF THEY HAD GONE THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS WHICH SOMETIMES TAKES TIME AND IS ALWAYS AGITATING BECAUSE IT'S LONG BUT JUSTICE IS LAW. AND A AND HAS TIME TAKES TIME THAT WE WOULD DO THINGS THAT. OF THAT MAKE SENSE INITIALLY NOTHING EVEN IN THE WHOLE ISSUE WAS WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE AT THE CAPITOL THERE AS I LISTEN TO MEMBERS THERE'S SOME. NOW. NOT INITIALLY REGRETS BUT CONCERNS ABOUT THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT ON OFF A LOT OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND SO. I KNOW THE DUE PROCESS IS A PROCESS THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T OR DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE AN ENGAGING IN. DON'T FEEL THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO FILE COMPLAINTS EVEN THOUGH THEY DO. ARE AND IT'S IS A LONG PROCESS BUT IF IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT. IN FAIRNESS TO BOTH SIDES OF THE THE DISCUSSION. CLEARLY. WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT SO I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THIS I'M GONNA SUPPORTED TODAY BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO TO THE JUDICIARY AND I WANT TO TALK WITH THE. THIS YEAR CHAIR AND FIND OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS AND WHETHER THAT IS GOING TO BE IN LINE WITH THE OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD DOING HERE. AT THE CAPITAL. US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T VIOLATE. FOLKS RIGHTS AND DON'T TRAMPLE ON PROCESSES THAT ALREADY EXIST THAT MAY NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED. SO I THANK YOU FOR THAT COHEN THANKS TO THE AUDIENCE FOR THEIR COMMENTS. THAT YOU DON'T WEBER. MAY THIS WILL COME AS A QUESTIONS. YOUR CLOTHES. TO ME ONE SECOND I SEE ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. SOME ARE MULLIN WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON MISS PHILIPPINES BILL. THANKS. FOR OVER TO CLOSE WELL I'D BE GRATEFUL FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND. SO I COULD CLOSE ON THAT. I'LL SECOND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ARE SEQUESTERED AYE VOTE. SO THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF BILLS THIS YEAR ON THE TOPIC OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS COMMITTEE. AS IT'S BEEN EXPRESS THE FRUSTRATION BY BY COLLEAGUES IS IN THE DIFFICULT POSITION OF DEALING WITH ONLY A SMALL SLIVER. OF THAT IMPORTANT ISSUE AND. I. UNDERSTAND THAT THAT CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING SINGLED OUT. AND I THINK THAT'S A VALID POINT AND AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES. ULTIMATELY I THINK THERE'S A BROAD AGREEMENT THAT THE RESPONSE TO THE ME TOO MOVEMENT NEEDS TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE. AND WE ARE DOING OURSELVES ANY FAVORS IF WE SIMPLY TARGET A SMALL SLICE OF THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY FOR NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS. AND I THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE SENTIMENT BEHIND THE CREATION OF THE JOINT RULES SUBCOMMITTEE. ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION. IN RESPONSE. THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE HOLISTICALLY AND TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO CHANGING THE COURTS OR ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF THE LARGER CAPITAL COMMUNITY. ANY SOLUTION TO CHANGING THE CULTURE ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT MUST INVOLVE LOBBYISTS. BUTTON THIS BILL IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. I THINK THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THE F. PPC IS THE PROPER ENTITY TO BE INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT I'D I'D. AND VERY SKEPTICAL THAT IT IS. A AND EVEN IF THE F. PPC CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO APPROPRIATELY INVESTIGATED THOSE COMPLAINTS. I'M NOT SURE THAT THE PENALTIES THAT ARE FOUNDIN THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT ARE NECESSARILY THE RIGHT REMEDIES FOR THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT. ON THE OTHER HAND BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF THE LEGISLATURE THEIR CHALLENGES ABOUT HOW TO RESPOND TO SUBSTANTIATE THE COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BY LOBBYISTS. UNLIKE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHO CAN BE CENSURED SUSPENDED OR EXPELLED FROM HIS CONDUCT. OR LEGISLATIVE STAFF WHO CAN BE TERMINATED OR SUSPENDED OR HAVE OTHER DISCIPLINARY STEPS TAKEN AGAINST THEM. THE OPTIONS FOR DISCIPLINARIAN THE OPTIONS FOR DISCIPLINING LOBBYIST SOON GAYS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE LESS WELL DEFINED. SO I THINK A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO RESPOND TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY LOBBYISTS IS A WORTHWHILE ONE TO HAVE AS PART OF THE BROADER CONVERSATION. ON THIS ISSUE. SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY SAID THIS ISSUE REMAINS PART OF THE THAT CONVERSATION. AND AS DOCTOR WEBER MENTIONED I THINK THAT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION WILL OCCUR IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WHERE THEY WILL BE HEARING A LARGE NUMBER OF BILLS DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT? I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO TAKE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST SQUARELY IN THIS COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION. AND I HOPE THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS BILL TODAY THE ISSUE MISCONDUCT BY LOBBYISTS WILL BE VIEWED IN THE APPROPRIATE CONTEXT. BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A VERY SMALL BUT IMPORTANT PIECE OF A VERY LARGE AND COMPLEX PUZZLE. WITH ALL THAT BEING SAID I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT WITH THE AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL A WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE HARPER. HARPER NOT VOTING CALDERON. MCCARTY. MULLIN. MULLIN AYE STEINORTH. WEBER. WEBER I. SO WE'LL KEEP THAT OPEN FOR. THAT BILLS ON CALL. AND WILL KEEP. THEN LEVELS UNCLE THOSE THAT VIGGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. SO NEXT UP WE HAVE. SOMEONE NUMBER GRAY WITH AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE. WHEN YOU READ MISTER GRAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS. THANK YOU I WILL BEGIN. BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS. IDENTIFIED ANALYSIS ONE STRIKING THE LANGUAGE RELATING TO THE RECEIPT OF A CONTRIBUTION AS NOTED ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. I AND NUMBERS AND SECONDLY I TO EXPAND THE BILL TO INCLUDE. THE RARE INSTANCES IN WHICH THE ASSEMBLY CONFIRMS GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTEES. HAS NOTED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS IN FRONT OF YOU MEMBERS. WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS AB TWENTY SIX EIGHT NINE WILL PROHIBIT A POLITICAL APPOINTEE. FROM MAKING A CONTRIBUTION OR PROVIDING A GIFT TO A LEGISLATOR OR ANY COMMITTEE CONTROLLED BY THAT LEGISLATOR DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE APPOINTEE IS SEEKING CONFIRMATION. UNDER EXISTING LAWS WE ALL KNOW ALL TO WELL ON THE HEELS OF THE RECENT FORM SEVEN HUNDRED DEADLINE. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS LEGISLATORS LOBBYISTS LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND OTHER GROUPS ARE IN IRAQ WITH THE POLICY MAKING PROGRESS. ARE SUBJECT TO THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT. THE LAW REQUIRES US TO A REPORT GIFTS CONTRIBUTIONS. I GIVE TO RECEIVED SHAREHOLDER INTEREST REAL PROPERTY INTERESTS AN OUTSIDE APPOINT THE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AMONG OTHER THINGS. AS NOTED BY THE F. PPC ITSELF THE GOAL OF THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT IS TO PREVENT BIASES. ACTUAL AND APPARENT THAT RESULT FROM FINANCIAL INTEREST OF DECISION MAKERS. HOWEVER POLITICAL APPOINTEES WHO HAVE NOT YET BEEN CONFIRMED BY THE LEGISLATURE FACE NO REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND NO ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY BY THE F. PPC. AS A RESULT AN INDIVIDUAL SEEKING THE CONFIRMATION OF A CONFIRMATION VOTE OF A SENATOR. ORRIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THAT MATTER IS FREE TO PROVIDE GIFTS AND OR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THOSE LEGISLATORS FOR PERSONAL GAIN. PROHIBITING SUCH CONTRIBUTION ACTIVITY IS NOT A NEW IDEA EXISTING LAW LIMITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO MEMBERS OF BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. AND APPOINT OFFICIAL MAY NOT ACCEPT A CONTRIBUTION OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE FROM AN APPLICANT UNTIL THREE MONTHS AFTER HIS OR HER. AGENCY'S DECISION ON THE MATTER IS FINAL. WE THE STATE LEGISLATURE MUST HOLD ITSELF TO A HIGHER STANDARD BY ADDRESSING A SIMILAR PRACTICE IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS WHICH IS CURRENTLY PERMITTED UNDER LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING NUMBER IMPACT ALWAYS FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BUT YOU'RE HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JOB. MEMBER THANK YOU FOR UPBRINGING THEY SAID THIS ISSUE FORWARD I THINK IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. I IN SOME THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL I THINK. HELPS CARACTERIZA THE CONCERNS THAT THAT THAT I AS WELL AS MANY VOTERS HAVE I IN TERMS OF CONTRIBUTIONS AND. THEIR RELATIONSHIP A WITH APPOINTMENTS. I. THE ONE OF THE ARTICLES THAT DAY YOU'VE SUBMITTED FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES DETAILED. A SITUATION SPECIFIC TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION I AND A. AND SOMEONE WHO HAD TO ARRANGE FOR A CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE MADE. UP BUT THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE ALSO MADE TO THE GOVERNOR AS WELL AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU. AMENDED THIS TO INCLUDE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY I THE QUESTION I HAVE IS UP WHY WITH WHERE THEY'RE NOT INCLUDED AMENDMENTS OR THE ORIGINAL CRAFT. I INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR. IS WELL SINCE I OBVIOUSLY THE APPOINTMENT PROCESS AYE IS CONTROLLED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS A MORE IMPORTANTLY THE GOVERNOR. THEMSELVES. ME THE THE ANSWER I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. AS IT RELATES THE GOVERNOR AND. THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTMENT PROCESS IT'S MORE OPEN ENDED I AND WE ARE. AS A MATTER OF PRACTICAL PURPOSE DON'T REALLY HAVE A WAY OF IDENTIFYING A WHO HAS OR HASN'T. POTENTIALLY BEEN CONSIDERED UP FOR APPOINTMENT A GIVEN THE. THE LACK OF INFORMATION I DON'T SEE A A FEASIBLE WAY IN WHICH TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THIS OUR PARTICULAR. MEASURE BUT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND. BUT CERTAINLY THE INTENT. BEHIND THE QUESTION. YEAH OF MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD UP BRIEFLY COMMENT IS THAT THE I AGREE WITH THE. CONCERNED SIDE OF THE AUTHOR AND OUT WITH THE INTENT. BUT THE THE MEASURE WON'T HAVE MY VOTE TODAY BECAUSE I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT THE IF ORDER TACKLE THIS ISSUE IT SHOULD BE BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR THAT'S COVERED BY. I THINK MISTER VARMA ECCLES JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT VERY MISTER VICE CHAIR. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS FROM THE POINT PRESS PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE WE'VE CONTINUED TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE SEED. A MUCH OF ITS AUTHORITY TO THESE APPOINTED A POSITIONS. AND ARE WHILE THIS MAY NOT BE A. HOLISTIC ENOUGH BUT FOR YOU IT CERTAINLY TAKES THAT FIRST STEP IN MAKING THOSE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE. BEEN APPOINTEE OF THE WATER BORDER THE AIRBORNE OR ANYTHING ELSE ANA THROWING FUNDRAISERS FOR THE CURRENT SANDERS VOTING ON THEIR CONFIRMATION THAT POINT YET I THINK IT'S A GOOD FIRST STEP IT. HOLDS THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN THE BILL A IN THAT WAY HOLDS THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE PROCESS ACCOUNTABLE IN THE BILL. I EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND. THE POTENTIAL APPLICANTS. THE VERY MUCH AND I'M GONNA QUICKLY GO BACK I TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT I THINK WE WE DO HAVE ONE YES MA'AM. WHOSE MIRAMONTE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. EXPANSION OF THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEAKS POSITIONS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND MONEY IN POLITICS. WE ARE SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SECOND. AND THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES. ISRAEL TO CLOSE WISH LIKE WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO THIS BILL WILL HELP PROTECT AGAINST ANY PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND GIVES COULD INFLUENCE THE LEGISLATURE'S VETTING CONFIRMATION PROCESS A GOVERNOR GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTEES. AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR CRAFTING THIS BILL CAREFULLY IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT AGAINST CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES. AND FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WITH THOSE AND AMENDMENTS AMER COMMANDING A. THEN I GO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY HE PLEASE HELLO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BERMAN AYE AYE. BERMAN AYE HARPER VOTING TODAY HARPER NOT VOTING CALDERON. MCCARTY. MULLIN. STEINORTH. WEBER. WEBER I. IT'S LEVELS ON CALL THE YOU'RE MUCH TAKE WHICH CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS. NEXT UP WE HAVE AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE BY SOMEONE NUMBER SAVANT THIS. READY WHEN YOU ARE GOOD MORNING COLLEAGUES SEN MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR. THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL THE PURPOSE BEHIND ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE IS TO PROVIDE BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS WITH MORE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION. TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS THE ENACTMENT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY AND TWENTY SIXTEEN SET UP THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH GOVERNS THESE TRENDS ADD TRANSITIONS. HOWEVER ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOUND THAT MORE TIME IS NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT THESE TRANSITIONS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OFTEN THE MORE TIME TO DO PUBLIC OUTREACH CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN THE MORE I TIME TO HELP UNREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES ORGANIZED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE OTHER INTEREST. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE WOULD HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY PROVIDING FOR A MUTUALLY AGREED TO EXTENSION OF NINETY DAYS TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS. AYE DURING THAT TIME POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS WOULD REMAIN BARRED FROM COMMENCE SEEN A LITIGATION AGAINST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER THESE CB ARE A. I JUST AS THEY ARE UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM ODD GIVEN ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY I LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS IS A CONSENSUS BILL SUPPORTED BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AS WELL AS MALL DEATH A SEATTLE YOU. COMMON CAUSE IN A SEVEN IN THE AYE AYE ASIAN ASSEMBLY EXCUSE ME ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE A COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DANE HUTCHINGS. ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND NICHOLAS HIGH DOOR AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. THE. CHAIR MEMBERS NICOLAS SITE ON CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE VERY PROUD SPORT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE WHICH WILL PROVIDE UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WITH MORE TIME IN OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN AN INAUGURAL DISTRICTING PROCESS. THIS YEAR I WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY COMMUNITIES HAVE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR REPRESENTATION ON THEIR LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS. MOST COMMON SEE VERY REMEDY IS TO OUR JURISDICTIONS WITHOUT LARGE ELECTIONS SYSTEMS TRANSITION BY DISTRICT ELECTIONS WHERE THERE'S LESS OF A CHANCE MINORITY VOTE DILUTION. BECAUSE THIS CHANGES MADE TO EMPOWER UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IS VITAL FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE A VOICE IN THAT FIRST DISTRICTING PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE IS THE MEMBER MENTIONED RECENTLY PASSED THE NUMBER OF A BENEFICIAL IMPROVEMENTS THIS HE VERY INCLUDING AB THREE FIFTY BY SOMEONE MEMBER LAY HOPE. WHICH SET UP THAT NINETY DAYTIME CARE FOR TRANSITIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO WISH TO REMAIN A WITHIN THE STATUTORY CAP ON RETURNEES FEES. WE THINK AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE REALLY BUILDS ON THAT FRAMEWORK. MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IT ALLOWS A SEE VERY PERSPECTIVE PLAINTIFF AND LOCAL JURISDICTION TO MUTUALLY AGREE TO AN EXTENSION BY UP TO NINETY DAYS FOR A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. TO COMPLETE THAT DISTRICTING PROCESS. THIS PROVIDES FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT AND MOBILIZATION UNDER REPRESENT COMMUNITIES. TELL OF USEFUL ENGAGEMENT OF UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IN THE DISTANT PROCESS OFTEN REQUIRE IDENTIFYING COMMUNITY LEADERS GOING ON EDUCATING PEOPLE IN THE DECISION PROCESS AND WHITE SO IMPORTANT REPRESENTATION. AS WELL AS MOBILIZING THE COMMUNITY TO ATTEND HEARINGS AND TO TESTIFY. WE'VE HEARD ON THE GROUND FROM SO RIGHTS GROUPS AS WELL AS FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE CAN BE DIFFICULT ACCOMPLICES IN ONLY NINETY DAYS. WE THINK AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREES TIME EXTENSION WILL GREATLY HELPED US THE BENEFIT TO BOTH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND UNDERREPRESENTED CHANGES FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE TAUGHT VOTE. THANK YOU FOR. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN RETAIN HUTCHINS LIQUOR CALIFORNIA CITIES. PROPER SUPPORT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE TO SIMPLE EXPANSION HAS BEEN AND AS BEEN DISCUSSED HAVE ASSEMBLY BILL THREE FIFTY WHICH IS A WEEK SPONSORED MEASURE. WHICH PROVIDE A SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENABLE THEM TO CONVERT DISTRICTS BY ORDINANCE. UNDER CURRENT LAW CITIES DO FEEL RUSHED TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO AVOID A VERY COSTLY LITIGATION IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS. BUT I AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE ALLOWS SAID IN ADDITION NINETY DAYS TO CONVERT TO DISTRICTS UPON MUTUAL AGREEMENT WITH THE PERSPECTIVE PLAINTIFF. I'M ALTHOUGH THE LEAGUE IS BEEN ON RECORD AS STATING THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT DISTRICTS AND I THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH DISTRICTS SHOULD BE THAT WAY. THAT IT SHOULD BE. THE. THE LEGISLATURE SPOKEN THAT REALLY IS THE DIRECTION THE STATE WANTS TO GO AND. WE DO DO SUPPORT MORE TIME WITHIN THE CONFINES OF AB THREE FIFTY WE THINK THAT BILL THIS BILL WILL HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REACH OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS. I HAVE A CHIU REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND ENSURE THAT I'M WE HAVE DISTRICTS DONE THE RIGHT WAY. I'M WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT I'M WORKING WITH AT THE CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP THE AUTHOR IN THE OPEN GOVERNMENT GROUPS AND THAT WE CAN TRY TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO ENSURE MORE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO SATISFY VOTING RIGHTS ACT LAWSUITS BUT. FOR TODAY'S PURPOSES WERE CERTAINLY. A PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND HOPE IT WAS FORCED DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I'VE. DOOR ROSE WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS TO CALIFORNIA HIGH. THE LEAGUE IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWO ONE TWO THREE IT'S REALLY AN AND ADJUSTMENT TO MEET THE ON THE GROUND REALITIES OF A LOCAL REDISTRICTING. A UNNECESSARY ADJUSTMENT. USE DISTRICT ELECTIONS ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AYE AND AND IT. GIVE A MEANINGFUL VOICE TO PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT TIME FRAME REALLY DEFEATS THAT PURPOSE BY. MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO GAUGE UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES IN PARTICULAR IN THE PROCESS AND THEREFORE WE THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TO CREATE A MORE GENEROUS TIMELINE THAT IS GOING TO INDEED. DE EFFECTUATE THE THE INTENT OF THE UNDERLYING LAW. WE ARE IN SUPPORT THINK VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL BONUSES. NAMING ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING IN SUPPORT PROMISE YET SOME HAVE A CELL YOU OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. POLITELY PUTTING ON BEHALF OF THE MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SECOND. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE A BRING IT BACK TO THE. MY COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BUT YOU'RE HARPER. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT UP POSITION THAT THE CITIES ARE AND I THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT OVER TIME WITH MULTIPLE PIECES OF LEGISLATION TRYING TO BASICALLY FORCE A CONVEYOR BELT. THAT CITIES ARE PLACED ON TAPE PROVIDE THEM. BUT THE MAP LIKE PIECES OF PIE AYE INTO THESE DISTRICTS WHERE THEY WISH TO DO SO OR NOT. SOME CITIES WANNA HAVE DISTRICTS SOME CITIES DO NOT. BUT WHAT THIS PROCESS IS BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THE LEGISLATURE'S MAJORITY SPIN IMPOSING ITS WILL ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY WANTED. UP INTO DISTRICTS ARE NOT. I CAN'T BE A PART OF THAT I'M SORRY I THINK THAT CITY'S INSTEAD OF A CAPITULATING AND SURRENDERING OUGHT TO STATE LAW SHOULD FIGHT OF FOR THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SELF DETERMINATION ON WHETHER THEY CHOOSE TO HAVE DISTRICTS. OR NOT THE VOTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CHOICE ON WHETHER THEY HAVE DISTRICTS OR NOT I DON'T THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE AND. A DEAL THAT'S DONE BY COUNCIL MEMBERS AURA OR OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS TO IMPOSE ON THE VOTERS THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE VOTERS EVENTUALLY BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE SAY ON WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE DISTRICT. I APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT I TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER UP FOR CITIES TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF THERE BEING DEALT BUT INSTEAD I THINK THAT LEGISLATORS SHOULD STAND UP. AND REVERSE THIS COURSE AND ALLOW CITIES TO BE ABLE HAVE THE SELF DETERMINATION ON THIS ISSUE THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO IN MY PAIN. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE WILL PROVIDE. A INCENTIVES TO OUR. THE TOUR COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE BETTER OUTREACH TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND TRULY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT ON THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS THAT A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFECT ON THE WAY THE LOCAL OFFICIALS. THE OUR ELECTED IN CALIFORNIA. I WON A JURISDICTION IS DRAWING DISTRICT LINES FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN MOVING FROM AT LARGE TO JUST REPLACE ELECTIONS. IT IS CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE ADEQUATE TIME FOR PUBLIC INPUT. BECAUSE THAT FIRST SET OF DISTRICTS OFTEN ENDS UP SERVING AS THE STARTING POINT FOR FUTURE REDISTRICTING PLANS. BECAUSE OF THAT. I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. I THINK YOU BRING AFFORD. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL ROLE IN THE MOTION IS TO PASS THIS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE HARPER. HARPER NO CALDERON. MCCARTY. MULLIN. STEINORTH. WEBER. WEBER I. THE BILL IS ON CALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT UP WE HAVE. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE BY SOME NUMBER KILEY. READY WHEN YOU ARE SIR. RIGHT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. THE VICE CHAIR AND I AND MEMBERS. JUST THREE DAYS AGO THIS MONTH WAS THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTH ANNIVERSARY THE RATIFICATION. THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT THE UNITED STATES CON. WHAT REQUIRES THAT EACH STATE'S U. S. SENATORS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THERE OF? BEFORE YOU'LL RECALL. THEY WERE APPOINTED. IN THE SPIRIT OF THE OCCASION I'M PROPOSING LEGISLATION THAT CLOSES WHAT U. S. SENATOR RUSS FEINGOLD FINDEL HAS DESCRIBED AS A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW. WONDERS ALOUD NATIONWIDE HUNDRED NINETY SIX SENATORS TO SERVE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE VOTERS IN CASES WITH A PREDECESSOR WAS UNABLE TO SERVE OUT THEIR FULL TERM. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE CLOSES ITS WOULD PULL. BUT REQUIRING THAT ALL U. S. SENATE VACANCIES IN CALIFORNIA. HE FILLED BY ELECTION. IN SO DOING IT MAKES CALIFORNIA'S PROCESS FOR FILLING THE SENATE U. S. SENATE VACANCIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE PROCESS ALREADY IN PLACE FOR FILLING VACANCIES IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND AS OUR FORMER OUR COLLEAGUE MR GOMEZ CAN TELL YOU. THE US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. ON THE NATIONAL STAGE SUCH A PROPOSAL HAS RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE SENATOR FEINGOLD AUTHORED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT READ QUOTE. NO PERSON SHALL BE A STATE SENATOR FROM THE STATE. IN LAST SUCH PERSON HAS BEEN ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE THAT ROB. SENATOR FEINGOLD EXPLAINED IT IS PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT APPOINTMENTS ARE AN ANACHRONISM. THAT MUST AND. IN NINETEEN THIRTEEN THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION. GIVE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY THE POWER TO FINALLY ELECT THEIR SENATORS. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME POWER. IN THE CASE OF UNEXPECTED MID TERM VACANCY. THAT THE SENATE IS RESPONSIBLE POSSIBLE TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. THAT PROPOSAL WAS CO AUTHORED BY SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN AND SENATOR RICHARD DURBIN. IT RECEIVED WIDE SUPPORT WAS EVEN ENDORSED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES AND PASSED IT JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE. IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED CONGRESS AN EQUALLY BIPARTISAN MEASURE WAS INTRODUCED AT THAT AT THE SAME TIME IN THE HOUSE AND OF THE HURDLES OF ENACTING WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TWENTY EIGHTH AMENDMENT. OPERATIVE TO HIRE MEMBER AT THE VERY. DIFFICULT PROCESS AND IT'S ONLY BEEN. ACCESSIBLE SEVENTEEN TIMES AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS TO AMEND THE US CONSTITUTION. AT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT MEASURES GOALS FOR OUR STATE. THROUGH LEGISLATIVE ACTION ALERT. AND THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPELLING REASONS. FIRST IT WOULD BRING CALIFORNIA SYSTEM FOR FILLING SENATE VACANCIES IN LINE WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT. THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD IS CLEAR THAT THE INTENT OF THE AMENDMENTS VACANCY BECAUSE. HAD ALWAYS BEEN TO MODEL THE FINAL THE FEELING OF SENATE VACANCIES AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE ON THE SYSTEM USED FOR FILLING VACANCIES IN THE HOUSE WHERE AGAIN SPECIAL ELECTIONS. ARE THE RULE. ACCORDING TO THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD OF MAY TWENTY THIRD. NINETEEN ELEVEN THE AUTHOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENTS VACANCY BECAUSE SENATOR JOSEPH BRISTOW. EXPLAINED HOW HE HAD USED TO QUOTE EXACTLY THE SAME LANGUAGE AND DIRECTING THE GOVERNOR TO CALL SPECIAL ELECTIONS FOR THE ELECTIONS OF SENATOR THE BILL VACANCIES THAT IS USED IN THE CONSTITUTION. AND DIRECTING HIM TO ISSUE WRITS OF ELECTION TO FILL VACANCIES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WELL IT IS THE CASE FROM THE SEVENTEEN THE MOMENT ALLOW STATE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURES TO EMPOWER THEIR GOVERNORS TO MAKE TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS TO THE SENATE. THESE APPOINTMENTS IF THEY OCCURRED AT ALL WERE ALWAYS MEANT TO BE JUST THAT TEMPORARY LASTING ONLY SO LONG AS IT WOULD TAKE TO ORGANIZE A SPECIAL ELECTION. THAT'S WHY THE VACANCY ACOSTA PILATES THAT IN THE EVENT OF A VACANCY. GOVERNOR'S QUOTE OF EACH STATE SHALL ISSUE WRITS OF ELECTION THE BILL SUCH VACANCIES. THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN GOVERNOR'S DETERMINED TO ARTIFICIALLY LENGTHEN THE TENURE OF APPOINTED SENATORS OFTEN POLITICAL ALLIES. MIGHT KNOWING THIS PROVISION. IN CALIFORNIA ON ALL FIVE OCCASIONS SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN. WHAT DO YOU WHAT SENATE VACANCY HAS OCCURRED? DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS LIKE HAVE DECLINED TO CALL A SPECIAL ELECTION. IFILL THE U. S. SENATE VACANCY NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR STOCK TO THIRTY STATUTORY AUTHORITY. TO DO SO. THE RESULT IS THAT APPOINTMENTS TO THE U. S. SENATE CAN LAST UP TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND IMPORTANTLY. THE APPOINTED INDIVIDUAL CONSERVE FOR DECADES PROVIDED HE OR SHE EVENTUALLY WINS ELECTION AFTER ACQUIRING THE ADVANTAGE OF INCUMBENCY BY APPOINTMENT. THIS POSES CHALLENGES TO THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF OUR STATE SUE KELLY ARE YOU MOVING ON TO A THIRD PAGE OF SINGLE. LINE COMMENTS AND I I'M VERY GOOD VERY CLOSE MISTER I DO THINKBUDGET HISTORY ISN'T AND I'M SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR COLLEAGUES READ. YOUR YOUR PURPOSE FOR THE BILL I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO I. FINISH MY REMARKS WHICH WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO. SO I THOSE EXPLAINING AND THIS POSES CHALLENGES TO DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTABILITY. TIME AND IT WAS THESE VERY CHALLENGES THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT CALLING FOR THE DIRECT ELECTION OF SENATORS. WAS DESIGNED TO RESULT. I AM AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE ARGUMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY AGAINST POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS BY THOSE WHO WERE IN FAVOR OF THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT. I IN THE WORDS OF ONE JOURNALIST OF THE DAY I SYSTEM BY APPOINTMENT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HAD ALLOWED SENATE SEATS TO BE QUOTE INDIRECTLY BOUGHT BY CONTRIBUTION TO PARTY FUNDS AND OTHER OUTLAYS MORALLY CORRUPT. WE CAN SEE MOST FAMOUSLY IN THE CASE OF ROBERT BOY* EFFORTS TO APPOINT A SUCCESSOR TO FORMER US SENATOR BARACK OBAMA. THAT THE ARGUMENT STILL APPLIES TO THE PLANET PRESENT I YOU MIGHT RECALL WILL GO THAT'S WAS RECORDED SAYING I'M MAKING A SLIGHT CHANGE TO ONE WORD HERE TO KEEP THINGS PGP. I'VE GOT THIS THING AND IT'S FREAKING GOLD. OTHER EXAMPLES OF NEPOTISM OR WORSE ABOUND REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR FRANK MAKOWSKI IN ALASKA OF COURSE APPOINTED HIS OWN DAUGHTER TO THE U. S. SENATE. TWO SENATORS WHERE THE SPOUSES OF THE GOVERNOR WHO APPOINTED THEM. IN NINE INSTANCES GOVERNORS HAVE BUILT A VACANT SENATE SEAT BY POINTING. THEMSELVES. BUT EVEN SHORT OF CORRUPTION OR NEPOTISM IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTMENTS TEND TO VIOLATE THE POPULAR WELL. U. S. SENATORS ARE IN MANY WAYS OUR STATE AMBASSADORS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ONLY GET TWO OF THEM THERE ARE NO TERM LIMITS THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE AFFAIRS OF OUR STATE AND THE COUNTRY CAN BE PROFOUND. AND VOTERS DO NOT NECESSARILY SEEK THE SAME QUALITIES IN A SENATOR BUT THEY DO IN THE GOVERNOR. TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THESE DEFICIENCIES. VACANCIES IN THE SENATE AS I'VE EXPLAINED ARE RELATIVELY RARE HAPPENING ON AVERAGE ONLY ONCE EVERY TWENTY FIVE YEARS PER STATE. BUT WHEN THOSE VACANCIES DO OCCUR IT'S IMPORTANT THAT OUR CITIZENS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND OUT WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF OF CAL ABOUT CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE IS JAKE LOCKER. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MORNING. I SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE WHICH PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DIRECTLY ELECT THEIR UNITED STATES SENATORS. WE A COMMON CAUSE BELIEVE THAT FILLING THE SENATE VACANCY. DECISION FAR TOO IMPORTANT TO LEAVE TO ONE PERSON. A US SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF MOST POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL OFFICIALS IN THE COUNTRY. REPRESENTING NEARLY FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. CALIFORNIANS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT UP TO TWO YEARS TO CHOOSE WHO WILL BE THEIR STATEWIDE REPRESENTATIVE ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. WELL AN APPOINTMENT IS CHEAPER AND FASTER THAN A SPECIAL ELECTION A SPECIAL ELECTION IS INHERENTLY MORE DEMOCRATIC. APPOINTMENTS ARE EFFECTIVELY ELECTIONS DECIDED BY AN ELECTORATE OF ONE. AND THERE'S NO CHECKER SAFEGUARDING THE CURRENT PROCESS AGAINST THE GOVERNOR APPOINTING A SENATOR WHO IS ON REPRESENTATIVE STATE. ADDITIONALLY AND APPOINTED SENATOR WOULD RECEIVE A MAJOR UNEARNED INCUMBENCY ADVANTAGE TOWARDS RETAINING THEIR SEATS. AN APPOINTEE WOULD HAVE UP TO TWO YEARS TO BUILD UP NAME RECOGNITION. GARNER ENDORSEMENTS AND SOLICIT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A POSITION OF POWER BEFORE EVER RECEIVING ABOUT. GIVEN THE HUGE ADVANTAGE THAT INCUMBENTS RECEIVE IN ELECTIONS. AND IT SENATORS OFTEN SERVE FOR DECADES ON AND. THE INFLUENCE OF A SENATORIAL APPOINTMENT COULD LINGER FAR BEYOND THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED ELECTION. FINALLY S. B. TWENTY FIVE TWELVE WILL LIKELY HAVE A BENEFICIAL DETERRENT EFFECT. SENATORS CONCURRENTLY TIME THEIR RESIGNATION RETIREMENT SO THEY COULD HOLD SOME SWAY OVER WHO WAS CHOSEN AS THEIR SUCCESSOR. OR AT LEAST OVER WHICH GOVERNOR CHOOSES THEIR REPLACEMENT. UNDER AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE HOWEVER SENATORS WOULD HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO LEAVE THEIR TERMS EARLY. FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA COM BECAUSE SUPPORTS AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE. PROTECT CALIFORNIANS RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHO REPRESENTS THEM IN WASHINGTON. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING NOW BRING BACK MY COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LESS YOUR HARBOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR SOME OF THE SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW STRIKING VIA THE INSTANCES OF NEPOTISM MORE IN TERMS OF OF THESE ISSUES. UP BUT WHEN I ASKED MY STAFF TO GET SOME INFORMATION THEY FOUND THAT. THAT MANY STATES ACTUALLY DO SPECIAL ELECTION ALABAMA LIKE ALASKA. CONNECTICUT LOUISIANA MASSACHUSETTS MISSISSIPPI NORTH DAKOTA OKLAHOMA OREGON RHODE ISLAND TAXES VERMONT WASHINGTON AND WISCONSIN STATES THAT OUR SMALL STATES THERE LARGE OBVIOUSLY A SPECIAL ELECTION LIKE THIS ISFEASIBLE WHETHER IT'S A SMALL STATE OR LARGE STATE. I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY DO HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY SURE HARPER. THE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND MISS HARPER. AND. OUT OF A COURTESY ADD TO MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND THANK YOU I WILL SECOND EVEN THOUGH I WILL NOT SUPPORT. YOU'RE VERY COURTEOUS YES SIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AYE AYE YEAH I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS A SENSIBLE MEASURE AND I I ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPER INTERESTING AND THAT. AND WELL DONE AND I ACTUALLY LEARNED QUITE A BIT FROM IT AND THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GOOD POINTS RAISED AYE IN IT AS WELL I THINK A LOT OF THE ISSUES RAISED ARE AT SOMEWHAT LOGISTICAL NATURE. YOU KNOW ON THEIR WAY TO COMPRESS THE TIMELINE FOR EXAMPLE SO I AM I JUST AFTER THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION TODAY IN ENDORSING THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE. OUR US SENATORS AND I'D BE VERY AYE OPEN TO US SORTA WORKING ON THESE WILL JUST WHAT'S LOGISTICAL ASPECTS GOING FORWARD SET THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER KILEY. AS HE ANNOUNCES POINTS OUT. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM THAT CREATES MORE PROBLEMS. AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS A TWO FOLD ONE IS HEARING CALIFORNIA WE GOT FIVE SITUATIONS A OF GOVERNOR GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTMENTS AND AND ONLY IN. FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE IN INTO ARE THE FIVE HAS THE APPOINTED SENATOR. SUCCESSFULLY RUN FOR REELECTION. IN ONE OF THE FIVE CASES THAT CHOSE NOT TO RUN INTO THE FIVE THEY RAN IN THE SUBSEQUENT ELECTION LOST SO VOTERS DID HAVE A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN. AND THE VOTERS WAITED AND THEN AND DECIDED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE WAS NOT THE APPROPRIATE PERSON. I'D NATIONWIDE. SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN. ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN SENATORS HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THIS PRIOR TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHO SUBSEQUENTLY SOUGHT A ELECTION AND OUT OF THAT FIFTY TWO AND A HALF PERCENT WHO PURSUED ELECTION WERE SUCCESSFUL. AND FORTY SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT WERE DEFEATED SO IT'S KIND OF A COIN FLIP A IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE VOTERS. GONNA VALIDATE THE GOVERNOR BIG GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTMENT BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT CREATES ARE ARE NUMEROUS AND I THINK SIGNIFICANT. ONE IS COST. AND A SPECIAL STATEWIDE ELECTION FOR FOR U. S. SENATE WILL COST A TOTAL OF TWO IT UP TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE PRIMARY. A HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE GENERAL OF THE MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THAT THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. WOULD HAVE TO BE ABSENT OF A VOICE OF A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT VOICE IN IT BODY WORK CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY UP UNDERREPRESENTED BASED ON OUR POPULATION AND WE. COULD. WE WOULD ONLY HAVE ONE REPRESENTATIVE IN THE U. S. SENATE. WHICH CAN BE CRITICAL AS WE'VE SEEN TO A LOT OF LEGISLATION AT ARGUE TERRIBLE LEGISLATION GETTING PAST. IN THE U. S. SENATE. IN ADDITION TO THAT. IN A BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT IF WE WERE TO MAKE THIS CHANGE IT WILL CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE ONLY WEALTHY PEOPLE WOULD EVEN HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING. BECAUSE BY HAVING A SPECIAL ELECTION FOR U. S. SENATE. A PRIMARY OCCURRING BETWEEN TWO TO FIVE MONTHS A AFTER THE RIGHT RESIGNATION OR DEATH OF A U. S. SENATOR. YOU WHO IT. WHAT NORMAL PERSON CAN WRAP UP A CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA? TO IT TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT TO SO MANY PEOPLE SO QUICKLY AND SO THAT MEANS THAT THAT. YOU KNOW THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT COULD POSSIBLY WIN ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN SOLVE FUND THEIR CAMPAIGNS. AND AND THAT'S REALLY A TERRIBLE THING I THINK FOR FOR THE OVERALL POPULATION SO. I APPRECIATE. THE VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS BY MY MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND. BUT FOR THAT THE CONCERNS THAT I EXPRESSED BY I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND AND RECOMMENDED NO VOTE. WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BERMAN. BERMAN NO HARPER. YEAH HARPER AYE CALDERON. MCCARTY. MULLIN. STEINORTH WEBER. SO THAT'S A ON CALL THANK YOU MISTER JACKSON FAMOUS GARLIC. WITHIN THAT. THAT'S ALL WE HAVE. NO WE HAVE IT'S OWN PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED UP SO LET'S SEE NO CHORE. LEVINE. IS THAT PERFECT. ALL THAT'S RIGHT MISTER HARPER WOULD YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL IN THIS OBERNOLTE BILL I'D BE HAPPY TO MISTER. NO GO AHEAD AND START WITH MY BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY THANK YOU SIR. AND I'LL GO AHEAD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. TODAY I HEAR I HEAR PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN MEASURE AS EVIDENCE OUT BY THE MOTION OF WILLS AUTHORIZED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE CONTRACT WITH THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION. COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE F. PPC. THE ADMINISTRATION FORSMAN OF LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND GOVERNMENT ETHICS LAWS. THE F. BBC ENFORCES THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT WHICH IS THE MAIN LAW THE GOVERNOR STATE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND GOVERNMENT ETHICS. THEY MAY IMPOSE ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AGAINST THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE ACT LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION COLLECTED MORE THAN ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES FROM ELECTED OFFICIALS LOBBYISTS AND POLITICAL DONORS. AND OTHERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. EVEN THOUGH THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT THEIR OWN ORDINANCES TO GOVERN CAMPAIGNS FOR LOCAL PUBLIC A POLITICAL OFFICE. THE FPP SEE DOES NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THOSE ELECTIONS INSTEAD THE ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LOCAL ORDINANCES IS TYPICALLY LEFT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY OR THE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. SINCE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LACK THE EXPERIENCE INVESTIGATING OR PROSECUTING CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS THERE IS VERY OFTEN LITTLE OR NO ENFORCEMENT ON THESE LOCAL CAMPAIGN LOTS. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED FOR BILLS THAT DO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONS EXTENDING AUTHORIZATION A DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE CONTRACT WITH THE AT PPC FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THEIR CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCES WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER PILOT PROJECTS IF YOU WILL. EACH BILL RECEIVED NEAR UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THIS BILL WOULD GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO BRING COST EFFECTIVE. SPURIOUS INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL ENTITY TO INVESTIGATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE OR OTHER GOVERNMENT ETHICS VIOLATIONS AND BRING ACTIONS AGAINST THESE VIOLATORS. WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY IS NICOLAS HERE. FOR THE UC COMMON CAUSE AND IS MORE ROB RAMAN FROM THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT YOU'RE MUCH. CHAIR MEMBERS A NICHOLAS ITEM WITH CALIFORNIA COME BECAUSE VERY PROUD SPONSOR AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY WHICH WOULD PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT FORCE AN OPTION. FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND ETHICS ORDINANCES NO COST TO THE STATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW OTHER THAN DISCLOSURE RULES THERE NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE LIMITS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENACT THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCES. FOR MANY DO SO IN FACT WELL OVER HUNDRED JURISDICTIONS HAVE ENACTED LOCAL ORDINANCES WHICH WE THINK IS A VERY GOOD THING. FOR LARGE JURISDICTIONS LIKE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY ESTABLISHING AN ETHICS COMMISSION IS AN EFFECTIVE AND FEASIBLE MEANS FOR DOING ENFORCEMENT FOR THESE ORDINANCES. BUT AS THE AUTHORS MENTION FOR MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS PARTICULARLY SMALLER AND MID SIZE JURISDICTIONS IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO AFFORD ESTABLISHING AN ETHICS COMMISSION. AS A CONSEQUENCE IT GENERALLY RELY ON THE CITY ATTORNEY OR DISK TURNING FOR ENFORCEMENT. BUT AS A RESULT UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL FORCE INTENSITY RARE. AS THE OTHER MENTION MANY CASES LOCAL CITY ATTORNEYS ARE DA'S DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN FORCING CAMPAIGN FINANCE RULES. MOREOVER THEY OFTEN OF OTHER PRIORITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHEN DECIDING HOW TO PRIORITIZE OUR RESOURCES MORE LIKELY TO PROSECUTE VIOLENT CRIME OBVIOUSLY THAN A CAMPAIGN FINANCE VIOLATION WHICH MAKES SENSE. FINALLY THERE'S ALSO RISK OF THE APPEARANCE OF POLITICAL BIAS WHEN YOU HAVE A CITY ATTORNEY WHO'S APPOINTED BY INCUMBENTS ON THE CITY COUNCIL OR ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY. I'D DOING PROSECUTIONS WITHIN A POLITICAL RACE. I AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY FOR ALL THESE REASONS WOULD ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT ACCORDINGLY CONTRACT VIA PPC FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL ORDINANCE. BECAUSE IF PPC SPECIALIZES IN CAMPAIGN ENFORCEMENT AND USES AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS WE BELIEVE THIS WILL STREAMLINING CRATE FOR MORE COST EFFECTIVE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT. AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF SETTING UP AN INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMISSION. MOREOVER THE EFFICACY IS HIGHLY RESPECTED AS AN IMPARTIAL BODY MAKING FOR SOME LESS CONTROVERSIAL LOCALLY. FINALLY BECAUSE IT REPORT CARMEN PARTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE THERE SHOULD BE NO COST OF STATE. I AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY AS WAS MENTIONED IS EXPANDING A SUCCESSFUL BIPARTISAN MODEL A WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THREE CITIES INCLUDING SACRAMENTO STOCKTON SAN AND BURNED YOU KNOW COUNTY MODEL. SAVE BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL LEADING TO MORE EDUCATION OF CANDIDATES ON LOCAL ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS THOSE MORE ENFORCEMENT AND HAD BEEN THE CASE. SO TO CONCLUDE AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY PROVIDES IMPORTANT ENFORCE AN OPTION IT'S ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO MAKE LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCES MORE EFFECTIVE. AND MORE FROM AYE EASILY ENFORCED. FINALLY AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ALSO LIMITS IN THE FOR FUTURE SPECIAL LEGISLATION BY OPENING THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS. A RELYING ON SPECIALIZATION CAN DELAY BY MORE THAN A YEAR THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TENSIONS OF THIS CONTRACT WHICH REVIEWS A HUGE BENEFIT TO THIS BILL. SEVERAL THESE REASONS WERE VERY PROUD SPONSOR THIS BILL AND URGE KNIFE. I THINK VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING WAS MARATHON ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. I CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER HIGH DOOR AND IT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTRACT WITH THE F. PPC. FOR THE ADMIN COULD IT REALLY FOR PUBLIC OFFICE AND PROVIDE EFFECTIVE MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT LASTLY WE'D LIKE TO THANK. MISTER HARPER FOR AUTHORING JUST IMPORTANT MEASURE THINKING. THE YOU'RE MUCH. THE POLITICAL GOTCHA. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PLEASE. PATRICK LANG PRESIDENT EXECUTIVE PER OF THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE US A. SMALL AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IT BETTER ENFORCEMENT OPTION. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DANE HUTCHINGS WITH A LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES I'M ALSO FROM MY COLLEAGUE. DEAING GIVEN FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION TRANSPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ME WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH AND READING ASSOCIATE TRIPLING THE ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. A WE'VE HAD ISSUES WITH THE BILL IN THE PAST. BUT. JUST SO I'M CLEAR THIS IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. CORRECT YET OR JURISDICTIONS UNDER THREE MILLION YES WITH THAT AMENDMENT. WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION FROM THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MAKE YOU THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. AND SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OR NEUTRAL. SEEING NINE BRING IT BACK TO MYSELF. LOOKING FOR A SECOND MR ARBOR. OF. MY SECOND IN MY OWN BILL I I I I MADE THE MOTION AND NO ONE ELSE IS IN ORDER SHALL BE HAPPY TO SIDE RECOMMEND. LEAVE OF THE CARE. THEY'D YOU SIR. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS. WHILE THE FTP SEES AGREEMENT TO ENFORCE SAN BERNARDINO IS CAMPAIGN FINANCE OR ITS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT'S CURRENTLY THE ONLY JURORS THERE ARE ONLY LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT THAT BE PCS AND FORCE THUS FAR. BECAUSE OF THAT. I WOULD FIND IT HARD TO JUSTIFY A PERMANENT EXPANSION THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT PP SEE TO ENFORCE LOCAL CAMPAIGN ETHICS LAWS FOR ANY JURISDICTION WITH A POPULATION. OF LESS THAN THREE MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT FURTHER EVALUATION BY THE LEGISLATURE US SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS LISTEN COMMON NUMBER EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE PC TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE STATUS OF THE AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO. AND ADDS A SEVEN YEAH THAT'S A SEVEN YEAR SUNSET CLAUSE AND IT PERMITS THE AT PPC TO TERMINATE AN AGREEMENT AS SPECIFIED IN ADDITION AS WAS MENTIONED COMMON NUMBER ONE CONTAINS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. WHICH PROVIDE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO A JURISDICTION WITH A POPULATION OF THREE MILLION OR MORE WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS I'M RECOMMENDING. SUPPORT VOTE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE BERMAN AYE. BERMAN AYE HARPER AYE AYE HARPER AYE CALLED ROOM. MCCARTY MULLIN. STEINORTH WEBER. THE BILL THAT DOES ON CALL. WHEN WE MOVE ON TO AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. TODAY. I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF OF MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAY OBERNOLTE. AYE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALLOWS THE SECRETARY OF STATE. TO ENROLL CALIFORNIA IN THE ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION INFORMATION CENTER OR ERIC. ERIC IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION GOVERNMENT MANAGED BY ITS MEMBER STATES. AND WHICH WAS FORMED TO IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF AMERICA'S VOTER ROLLS AIR COMPARES MEMBER STATES VOTER ROLLS AGAINST SEVERAL DATABASES INCLUDING THE DMV SOCIAL SECURITY RECORDS. TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STATES BORDER ROLES ARE AS UP TO DATE AS POSSIBLE ALLOWING MEMBER STATES. A CLEAN UP THEIR VOTER ROLLS AND HELP IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NEED TO REGISTER SUCH AS SOMEONE WHO MOVED TO CALIFORNIA FROM ANOTHER STATE.

OUR ANY OF OUR VOTER INFORMATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER HARPER ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OUT NOPE SEEM NOT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CHEN MEMBERS MANY ITS ROMANCE YES I'M AND NEARLY HALF OF A SO YOU OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS. BUT PRIMARILY BUT AND THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS THIS BILL THE TRANSFERRING OF DATA WITHOUT. THE CONTENT OF VOTERS. AM TO A NON GOVERNMENTAL THIRD PARTY IN PARTICULAR IS CONCERNING. AND WE THINK IT'S CONTRARY TO PRIVACY STATUTES IN. THE GOVERNMENT CODE THE MOTOR VEHICLE CODES. AND THE CIVIL CODE. AND I APPRECIATE. THE AUTHORS IS WILLING TO ADMIT COMMITMENTS THE BILL BUT I THINK IT EXCEPT AMEND. THE GOVERNMENT CODE THE CIVIL CODE AND AT THE MOTOR VEHICLE CODE. TO NOT BEING CONTRARY TO THOSE PRIVACY STATUTES. I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL BOSS POSITIVES THAT COME WITH ERIC AND THAT. THE ANNOUNCES THE BILL NOTES WHAT. AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS COTTON RECENTLY IN FEBRUARY THEY WERE POTENTIALLY THOUSANDS OF VOTERS WHO WERE. FALSELY. AT. THAT THERE WERE POTS POSITIVES THAT THEY HAD AND HAD MOVED AND THEY SHOWED UP. I AM ON ELECTION DAY AND WERE NOT ON THE ROLLS. SO LET'S. ANOTHER CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL AND AND I I THINK IT'S ALSO CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY. AM EVEN ACTED A NUMBER OF REFORMS THAT HAVE THE OPTION TO CLEAN UP OUR ROLES. AND I HAD PEOPLE TO THE ROLES WHICH I THINK IS IS THE AIM OF ERIC. AND THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF REFORMS AT AT THE DMV WE HAVE STREAMLINED REGISTRATION AT THE DMV NOW THE GAME IS ALSO ALLOWING VOTERS TO UPDATE THE REGISTRATION TO THEY MOVE BETWEEN COUNTIES. WHICH IS NEW AMBER ALSO LAUNCHING I'M. ASSN DAVID AT INTERRUPT RUSSELL LUNCHING AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION AT DMB WHICH ISN'T WHICH SHOULD. AND RESEARCH ON ITS POTENTIAL TED MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO OUR ROLES. AND THE STATE IS LESS THAN A YEAR AND A HALF INTO THE LAUNCH OF VOTE COUNT WHICH THAT SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE CLEANING UP OUR ROLES AND AND THE SHARING OF DATA BETWEEN COUNTIES. AND THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR WITH THE GENERAL AND IN A GENERAL ELECTION RIVER GOING THAT SAME DAY REGISTRATION AND EVERY COUNTY. WHICH ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ADD VOTERS THE ROLES AND GIVE VOTERS A CAPTAIN WHO MAY HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS RICHARD ABOUT. IT WE THINK SUPPORT TO LET THOSE REFORMS PLAY OUT BEFORE WE AND. IT CAN BE DRASTIC STEP WHICH I HAVE THAT. AT THE PRICE YOU ARE VOTERS AT RISK AND. ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL OF FALSELY REMOVING VOTERS AND THEY'RE AWESOME WE FOUND. ACTUALLY AT OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DOT A THE MAN WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND SOME OF SECOND. PROJECT CLOSE.

AB TWENTY TWO FORTY FIVE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I COME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TO FORTY FIVE WHICH WOULD PROTECT MINERS PRIVACY BY ENSURING THAT THE. REGISTRATION INFORMATION OF SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE PRE REGISTERED TO VOTE IS NOT SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE. JUST LAST WEEK SECRETARY OF STATE PATEA ALEX PADILLA ANNOUNCED THAT OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS. HAVE PRE REGISTERED TO VOTE SINCE THE STATE'S PRE REGISTRATION PROGRAM LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN. I'M THRILLED THAT SO MANY YOUTH HAVE TAKEN THIS CRITICAL STEP IN BECOMING ENGAGED ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR DEMOCRACY. AS MORE MINERS REGISTER TO VOTE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE PRIVACY BY PROHIBITING THE DISCLOSURE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. UNDER STATE LAW CERTAIN VOTER REGISTRATION INFORMATION INCLUDING NAMES HOME ADDRESSES TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR RESTRICTED USE BY CAMPAIGNS. JOURNALISTS AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS. THE LAW IS UNCLEAR WHETHER INFORMATION RELATED TO SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD PRE REGISTRANTS CAN BE DISCLOSED IN THE VOTER FILE. AB TWENTY TO FORTY FIVE WILL CLARIFY THAT THE INFORMATION OF MINERS WHO WILL NOT BE EIGHTEEN BY THE TIME OF THE NEXT ELECTION BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. AND PROHIBITED FROM DISCLOSURE. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO EXPAND THE EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT COUNTIES THAT COUNTIES ELECTIONS OFFICIALS PROVIDE THE SECRETARY OF STATE. WITH INFORMATION ON PERSONS WHO HAVE PRE REGISTERED TO VOTE COLLEAGUES I AM HEARTENED BY THE EARLY ENGAGEMENT BY SOMEBODY YOUTH AND IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY OF MINORS.

IMPORTANT IMPORTANT THINGS. AS YOU KNOW LAST MONTH THIS COMMITTEE HELD A JOINT INFORMATION ON HEARING ON THE TOPIC OF ELECTION CYBERSECURITY. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS FROM THAT HEARINGS THAT EXPERTS BROADLY AGREE THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT VOTING MACHINES OR VOTE OR VOTE TALLYING IN CALIFORNIA OR COMPROMISE DURING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION. AND WHILE THERE WERE AND WHILE THAT WAS A REASSURING IMPORTANT MESSAGE FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC TO HEAR. THE FEDERAL STATE AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO TESTIFIED AT THE HEARING ALL AGREED THAT WE CANNOT BE COMPLACENT BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE CYBER THREATS TO OUR ELECTIONS ARE GOING AWAY. IN FACT IN THE EXPERT WITNESSES AT THE HEARING EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO IDENTIFYING IN RESPONDING TO CYBER THREATS. ONE OF THE RECURRING THEMES THAT EMERGED DURING THE TESTIMONY AT THE IN FROM AT THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING. IS THAT MAXIMIZING THE CITY CYBERSECURITY OF OUR STATES ELECTIONS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DEDICATED TO THAT PURPOSE. IN PARTICULAR MANY WITNESSES EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION SHARING AND COORDINATED EFFORTS BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT SMALLER COUNTIES THAT A MORE LIMITED RESOURCES IN THEIR ELECTIONS OFFICES AND MUST RELY ON THE ASSISTANCE THAT IS PROVIDED BY FEDERAL AND STATE OFFICIALS. AND BY OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCES. AB THIRTY SEVENTY FIVE WOULD CREATE THE OFFICE OF ELECTION CYBERSECURITY WITHIN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. THE. THOUGH THE OFFICE OF. YOU THE OFFICE OF ELECTIONS A CYBERSECURITY WOULD COORDINATE EFFORTS BETWEEN FEDERAL STATE LOCAL OFFICIALS INCLUDING COUNTY REGISTRARS OF VOTERS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD AND SEVERITY OF CYBER INCIDENTS THAT THREATEN THE INTEGRITY. OF CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS.

CALDERON AYE MCCARTY. MULLIN. STEINORTH. STEINORTH AYE WEBER. SO THAT WILL BE ON CALL AND UP FOR YOUR NEXT BILL. LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A CHOICE A TO. I'LL GO WITH. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND ALL BUT ONE STATEWIDE ELECTION SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA VOTES. HAVE BEEN CAST ON VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS AND THE ROLE THAT THE POSTAL SERVICEPLAYS IN OUR STATES ELECTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS COUNTIES ADOPT THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS CHOICE ACT. UNDER THAT LAW WHICH IS BEING IMPLEMENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FIVE COUNTIES THIS YEAR. EVERY VOTER IN A PARTICIPATING COUNTY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL WHETHER THEY REQUESTED ONE OR NOT. CALIFORNIA ALREADY REQUIRES COUNTIES HAVE A FREE ACCESS SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS A VOTE BY MAIL VOTER TO DETERMINE IF HIS OR HER BALLOT WAS RECEIVED BY THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL AND IF IT WAS COUNTY. THOSE SYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT IN HELPING MAINTAIN VOTERS CONFIDENCE THAT THE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED. BUT OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED MORE EXTENSIVE VOTE BY MAIL TRACKING THE NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE VOTER PARTICIPATION AND REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS THAT ARE INVALIDATED. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN REQUIRES THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR USE BY COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS THAT ALLOWS A VOTER TO RECEIVE TEXT OR EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS OR HER VOTE. BY MAIL BALLOT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE POSTAL SYSTEM AND AS IT IS PROCESS BY THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL. NOT ONLY WILL THE SYSTEM GIVE VOTERS GREATER PEACE OF MIND WHEN CASTING ABOUT BY MAIL. BUT IT WILL ALSO HELP ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TAKE STEPS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER. OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS THAT ARE UNABLE TO BE COUNTED. ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WILL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY CONTACT VOTERS WHOSE BALLOTS A RETURNED AS UNDELIVERABLE. AND IF A VOTER FORGETS TO SIGN THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT ENVELOPE OR THE SIGNATURE ON THE ENVELOPE DOESN'T MATCH THE ONE ON FILE FOR THAT VOTER. THE ELECTIONS OFFICIAL CAN USE THE SYSTEM TO NOTIFY THE VOTER OF STEPS THAT HERE SHE CAN TAKE TO HAVE THAT BALLOT COUNTED. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN IS SUPPORTED BY SECRETARY OF STATE OUT EXPEDIA AND THEY SEE ALL YOU AMONG OTHERS AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME. TODAY IS ROLL ROLL MISIA'S UP FROM THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR ADVOCACY AND POLICY. AND MY OLD FRIEND AND DEAR FRIEND TIFFANY BOX. PLEASE PROCEED. AT. KAREN MEMBERS AROMASEAL SOME OF OF A CITY OF CALIFORNIA WHERE IT'S FOR THE BILL WE. FOR THE REASONS THE AUTHOR SAID WE. AND WE AGREE THAT'S IMPORTANT PROVIDE. I HAVE VOTERS THAT PEACE OF MIND THAT THE VOTERS COUNTED AND PROVIDE THAT TRANSPARENCY WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN THESE CASES WHERE THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE VOTE BY MAIL. AND TO NOTIFY THE VOTER AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX SOMETHING IF THERE IS AN ISSUE. EFFECT. BOB. IT'S ALL YOURS CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN LITIGATION OVER. NOTICE IN THE ABILITY TO CARE WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A SIGNATURE MATCHING. I'M LOOK AT. AB SUPERIOR COURT AND SENATE CISCO RULED THAT ITS IMPACT UNCONSTITUTIONAL NOT TO PROVIDE VOTERS NOTICE AND OPPORTUNITY CARE. I THINK THIS WOULD THIS BILL WOULD GIVE AB COUNTIES THAT TYPE OF SYSTEM THEY NEED. TO TO NOTIFY VOTERS IT WOULD HELP AND WE TAKE AN IMPORTANT SEPTIC YOU SOLVING THAT. AS I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING IN IN THE DATA WE. I WE LOOKED AT REGARDING THE SIGNATURE MATCH CASES. THE. THE VOTERS AFFECTED WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY LATINO ASIAN AMERICAN NATURALIZED CITIZENS AND YOUNG VOTERS. I'M FOR STRONG IT'S PART THE SPELL WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STEP TO NOTIFYING VOTERS IN MAKING SURE THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIX ANY PROBLEMS OF THE VOTES. AND GIVING VOTERS A PIECE MIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT BAKER IN FAVOR. TIFFANY MOCKUP ME HALF THE SECRETARY STATE HOW EXPEDIA IN SUPPORT OF THE. THANK YOU BY ANY OTHERS ARE WILLING TO. OR WISHING TO WHY ADD THEIR SUPPORT ON. SEEING NONE ANY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OUR. OR COMMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE. ALL AYE AYES AYE SECOND FOR CONSIDERATION UP BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT I DO WANT TO ASK ABOUT. LOTT MISTER CHAIR AT TWO YEARS AGO A GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A SIMILAR BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY THEIR. VOTERS IF THEY'RE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WAS NOT COUNTED TO PROVIDE THE REASONS WHY THE BALLOT WAS NOT COUNTED. THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE I STATED THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY. CURRENTLY LAW REQUIRES A COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL TO ESTABLISH OF FREE ACCESS SYSTEM. THAT ALLOWS A VOTE BY MAIL VOTER TO LEARN WHETHER HIS OR HER BALLOT DISCOUNTED AND IF NOT THE REASON WHY THE BALLOT WAS NOT COUNTD. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS SUFFICIENT. THE VOTER SAID IN HIS HAVE VETO MESSAGE. SO. WITH THAT IF YOU CAN ARTICULATE. REASONS WHY YOU THINK THAT THIS MAIL BILL MAY BE DIFFERENT OR MAKE THOSE ARGUMENTS ON WHY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD RECONSIDER SURE I'M NOT I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AT YOUR HARPER I'M NOT INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH WITH THE PRIOR BILL THAT WAS VETOED. BUT THIS IT COULD CREATE EATEN UTILIZES TECHNOLOGY TO EASILY PUT OUT INFORMATION TO VOTERS TO GIVE THEM AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THEIR BILL AS IT MOVES ALONG IN THE PROCESS. SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TRIED IN DENVER. AND AND HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND. WERE ALL VERY BUSY. AND ARE VOTERS. OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE ARE. BUSIER THAN WE ARE. TRYING TO ESPECIALLY IN MY DISTRICT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO STAY THERE. RAISE A FAMILY WORK. MAYBE HAVE A HOBBY OR TWO AND SO MOST OF THEM AFTER THEY VOTE. ASSUME THEY VOTED. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING ON TO A WEBSITE TO CHECK WHETHER OR NOT THERE BALLOT GOT COUNTY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T TELL THEM IF IT WASN'T COUNTED IT JUST GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. IT WAS COUNTY AND WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT FROM OUR VOTERS THAT THEY HAVE TO PROACTIVELY GO ONTO A WEBSITE TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE BOTH ARE COUNTED WE E. AS THE STATE. SHOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THE DATA THAT IF IT WASN'T COUNTED Y. NOT. AND AND WHAT CAN THEY DO TO REMEDY THE SITUATION THIS IS. A SYSTEM A A. NOT VERY EXPENSIVE SYSTEM THAT GIVES OUR VOTERS INFORMATION. RATHER THAN EXPECTING THAT THEY'RE CONSTANTLY TRACKING THE BALLOT THEY SHOULD HAVE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM THAT ONCE THEY SUBMIT THE BALLOT IT'S IT'S GOOD. IF IT IS AND I THINK WE AS A STATE GIVEN THE THE NOMINAL COST OF THE PROGRAM. AND AND THE BENEFIT THAT IT PROVIDES. SHOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT INFORMATION IN IN THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD WAY TO DO IT BALLOT MY MY WITNESSES THAT CAN I WOULD JUST ADD ON SO. THE CORDON CHAIRMAN JUST GO. LOOK AT THIS AND SAID THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH THAT DUE PROCESS REQUIRES AFFIRMATIVE NOTICE. WHEN WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO NOTIFY. VOTERS IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY THERE'S A PLACE TO GO LOOK AT. THANK YOU AND THE BILL WAS ALREADY YOU HAD ALREADY MOVED THE BILL AND I HAD A RE-ATTEMPT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I SEEING NONE OF WHICH YOU LIKE. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS TO CLOSE ORDER RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU AND. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
