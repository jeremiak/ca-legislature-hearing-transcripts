PATIENT SAFETY UNDER THE ENERGY TO RELEASE AND COMMUNICATIONS STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE. IS BEING HELD TIGHTLY WITH THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. I'M OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY WE CAN DISCUSS THE DEVELOP. BEFORE YOUR UNDERGROUND FACILITIES EXCAVATE. OF AND THAT'S AWFUL AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW IT'S BETTER AND SAFER IT'S THE BIG BOARD- OF- DIG SAFE BOARD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOAL THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS AND WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP SAYS THAT WE DO DIG SAFE AS YOU ARE LIKELY AWARE THE DIG SAFE ISSUES HAVE BEEN OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND FRIENDLY TO ME PERSONALLY IS IT GOES BACK A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE SAW SUCH A RASH OF DEATHS AND DESTRUCTION AND INJURIES CAUSED BY THE DIGGINS. AROUND CALIFORNIA AND I- AND- AND THE DOCTOR MARINO AT THE TIME WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS AND SAID THIS CAN'T CONTINUE AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN PLACE NOTHING IN PLACE THAT COULD OFFER SOLUTIONS THE PROTECTIONS ENFORCEMENT THE EDUCATION AND WHEN YOU SEE THAT VACUUM. THE ONLY CONCLUSION THAT WE COULD COME TO WAS THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE. AND IT WILL CONTINUE WITH MORE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION PROPERTY DAMAGE AND THE INJURIES SO. TO HAVE A OF. THE PAST HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR THE VERY BOARD WE HAVE TODAY. AND TO HAVE A SINGLE AUTHORITY- COORDINATING DIG SAFE EFFORTS INCLUDING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THOUSANDS OF DIGGINS IN CALIFORNIA ANNUALLY AND ONLY A SMALL SUBSET ARE OR EVENTUALLY ARE CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED. AS MENTIONED IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE BACKGROUND PAPER OF THE APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND. FIVE THOUSAND GAS DIG. ONLY ONE ARE INVESTIGATING A REPORTED PORTED TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES MISSION LEAVING A UNIVERSE OF ROOM UNEXAMINED AND UNEXPLAINED DIGGINS THIS IS WHY THE WORK OF THE DIG SAFE BOARD IS SO CRITICAL AND WHY THEIR FUTURE SUCCESS IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME AND I THINK TO OUR LEGISLATURE SO I'M GLAD YOU JOINED YOU MIND ME TODAY TO DISCUSS THE BOARD'S PROGRESS AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THE NEXT STEPS THAT MAY BE OPEN FOR US. BECAUSE CAL STILL HAS A WAY TO GO TO ADDRESS SAFE EXCAVATION PRACTICES IS THIS JULY TRAGIC ACCIDENT IN MARIETTA CALIFORNIA HIGHLIGHTED THE WELCOME BOARD CHAIR CARL VOSS. WILL REMEMBER. DEL TORO AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TONY MARINO'S THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING AND BEING PART OF THIS. IS DISCUSSION SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD I DID WANT TO MENTION. ELEVEN OH EIGHT. PAUSE FOR EIGHTY FIVE SECONDS. THE CITY A PARADISE ADRENO- WAS DESTROYED A YEAR AGO. AND I'M THEY'VE ASKED THAT AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE CELEBRATING THE LIVES OF THE EIGHTY FIVE LOST AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD. TO PAUSE FOR THAT EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE SECONDS TO MEMORIALIZE. AND FIND US THAT THIS COULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. SO WITH THAT. WILL BEGIN AND- I THINK OF. THE CARS FIRST THE BOSS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR. OF FIRST I WANT TO. FIRST I WANT TO THANK STAFF UNDER THOROUGH AND WELL REFERENCE THAT BACKGROUND PAPER I'M CARL VOSS CHAIRMAN OF THE UNDERGROUND FACILITY SAFE EXCAVATION BOARD WE CALL IT THE STICKS A POOR BECAUSE OUR REAL NAME IS A BIT OF A TONGUE TWISTER HAS ALLUDED TO EARLIER. WITH ME TODAY IS MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBER MARGE- MARGIE- TORO AND OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER TONY MARINO. MY DAY JOB AS LAND MANAGER MY FARMS OUT OF BAKERSFIELD. I WANT TO SAY THAT HAVING THE HONOR OF SERVING ON THE BOARD WAS NOT. THAT WAS ON MY RADAR BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WHEN I WAS ASKED BY MY COMPANY TO APPLY FOR THIS APPOINTMENT I HAD NO IDEA OF THE IMPORTANT ROLE SELF AND FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS. WOULD FACE IN ADMINISTERING GOVERNMENT CODE FORTY TWO SIXTEEN. NOW I UNDERSTAND THE MAGNITUDE OF OUR ROLE. FOR ME THE PROUDEST MOMENT WAS CONVINCING MY FELLOW AGRICULTURALIST TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POP. AS A RULE MAKING FOR THE AREA OF CONTINUAL EXCAVATE. FOR AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT ACE. TRANSLITERATED THE STRUGGLES IN A FILL THE ALL NAY INTERPRET THE FORTY TWO SIXTEEN AND HOW TO APPLY IT IN THE FIELD. DURING THE RULE MAKING PROCESS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE MY FOOT BOARD MEMBERS TO THE FIELD AND SHOW THEM EVERY DAY TELL IS ACTIVITIES OVER HIGH PRIORITY SUBSURFACE INSTALLATIONS. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US IN THE SAFE IN EDUCATION. LEADS TO A SMALL EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES THE REASON WE'RE ALL HERE IS THAT THIS IS CLOSE NOT BEEN A FACTOR IN PROMOTING SAFETY THE EXISTING EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGNS ARE TARGETED AND PEOPLE AT THE BILLBOARDS IN THE COMMERCIALS OF CALL EIGHT ONE ONE. AND DON'T THINK IT APPLIES TO THEM. THE QUOTE UNQUOTE INDUSTRY STANDARDS. AND SAFETY METRIC OF DAMAGES PER THOUSAND DOESN'T TELL US A LOT ABOUT HOW TO MOVE. THE NEEDLE ON SAFETY. AND YOU MISTER CHAIR SAID IT BEST WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT LIABILITY. IF YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME THE LIBERTY I'LL QUOTE FROM A STATEMENT YOU MADE IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ASSEMBLY HEARING WHERE HE SAID QUOTE THE WORST PART ABOUT THESE DISPUTES BETWEEN THE EXCUSE THERE'S AN OPERATOR'S. IS HOW THEY ARE RESOLVED IN SETTLEMENTS WITH NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS WERE BOTH SIDES WALK AWAY FEELING THEY GOT THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. AND LEARNING NOTHING ON CLOSE. TO REMEDY THIS WE'VE TRIED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH BY SPENDING OUR FIRST TWO YEARS IN OPERATION BY LISTENING TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS. INCLUDING THOSE WHOSE STORIES HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY OVERLOOKED. THERE ARE TOO MANY DIFFERENT PLAY EACH WITH THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE IN CAT AND WE CANNOT PREVENT A NOSE. OUR FOCUS ON LISTENING IS HELP US PRODUCE SAFETY POLICY BASED ON. PEOPLE EXPECT THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM. TO DO WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO BE SAFE. DON'T ALWAYS AGREE ON WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY BUT EVERYONE DOES AGREE THAT MIDDLE TO THE OR ITS MISSION IS TO GO OUT AND TELL PEOPLE HOW TO BE SAFE. SO FAR WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE VERY LITTLE OF THAT. IS SO IMPORTANT IS IT HAS IT HAS IT BEEN TO. LISTEN AND LEARN FROM OUR DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS. I WILL NOW TURN MEMBER DEL TORO TO TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBER OF US. WE CAN CATEGORIZE WHAT WE INTO TO BIG BANDS FIRST. FOLLOWING SAY ASSIST AS LAID OUT IN STATUTE. X. AREN'T OFTEN IN THE FREE EIGHT ONE ONE SERVICE BEFORE DIGGING. THIS CAN BE BECAUSE OF LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW. OR THEY SIMPLY DON'T THINK OF THE WORK THEY DO AS EXCAVATING. WE PROBLEMS IN LOCATING. AND PROBLEMS AND PEOPLE JUST COMMUNICATE WITH. OUR SECOND MAJOR FINDING IS THAT CURRENT LAW AND- ARE INSUFFICIENT TO HELP PEOPLE DO THEIR JOBS. AND SAFELY. THIS YOU RECKON AS YOU WROTE SB SIX. TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE LEGISLATURE MORE. WHEN IT PASSES MORE LEGISLATION IN THE RECENT YEARS. WE'RE DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES DURING OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS AND WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THIS LATER IF YOU'D LIKE. FOR EVERY PROBLEM WE HAVE TO SOLVE WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT SEEING THE EDUCATION COMPONENT. I AM PRESIDENT AND FOUND A VHS INTERNATIONAL INC. IT'S A SAFETY FIRM AND I'VE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. MY FOCUS ON EDUCATION COMES FROM BOTH MY PROFESSIONAL AND MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I DON'T NEED A SCRIPT TO SHARE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE YOU SEE I AM A CHILD THAT LOST LOVED ONES. WHEN I WAS TWELVE I LOST AN IMPORTANT FATHER FIGURE MY UNCLE. HE WAS ELECTROCUTED AT A WORK SITE. AT THAT POINT HE HAD LEFT BEHIND NOT ONLY HIS WIFE BUT THREE YOUNG CHILDREN. OF COURSE THE IMPACT ARE FROM FAMILY WAS INTENSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY FUTURE HELD OR WHAT GOD'S PLAN WAS FOR ME BUT HERE I AM WHEN I'M- HERE. FRONT OF YOU. FAST FOR I'M IN COLLEGE SECOND YEAR COLLEGE FIRST GENERATION FOR MEXICO EXCEPT THE FIRST ONE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE WHEN I GET A CALL. I GET A CALL THAT MY MOTHER WAS ELECTROCUTED. SHE WAS A NURSE ASSISTANT AT A PROMINENT HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LIVE IN MY SIBLINGS LIFE CHANGED AT THAT MOMENT. ALL OUR DREAMS HAVE I'M HERE. TO BE THE VOICE FOR THOSE FAMILIES THAT HAVE LOST LOVED ONES. I TURNED THAT TRAGEDY INTO TRIUMPH. I AM HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT TWENTY THREE YEARS AGO. I DECIDED TO START SAVING LIVES IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE. THAT EXPERIENCE COMPLETELY CHANGED MY LIFE CHANGE MY SIBLINGS FIVE. AND I AM SO HONORED. AND YOU SENATOR HILL. PEOPLE LIKE TO LIKE YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I. WAS VERY EXCITED AND HUMBLE TO BE ABLE TO MEET YOU BECAUSE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THIS AS- SO THANK YOU. MEMBER pCOME BEFORE HASN'T WORKED. AND HOW WE NEED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AS HE SAID IT STARTS WITH LISTENING. IT STARTS WITH THE IF AT A COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. HOW THE JOB FINISHED IT WILL BE FINISHED. DELIVERING ROCK AND EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION TO THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. THE WAY THAT THEY DO BUSINESS. LET AND SKIPPERS. ROAD BUILDERS YOU TOO. DIFFERENT AND THE TWO TOOLS WE USED TO REACH THEM MUST ALSO BE DIFFERENT. IT'S A LONG ROAD AND WE WILL BE THE ONES TO SEE IT TO THE END. FOR ME WHEN MY TIME IS UP WITH THE BOARD. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK. I KNOW THAT I BUILT THE. I WANT TO SEE THAT THIS HAS OPPOSED TO LIST. I UNDERSTAND. AND TO CREATE A CULTURE OF SAFETY. I ALSO WANT TO SEE THAT THIS BOARD HAS A CONSCIENCE AND WISDOM TO A WIN. WHEN TO WHEN NOT TO. USE THIS GREAT POWER IF INTERESTED IN US. SO THAT THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WILL BRING THE MISSION HOME. I KEEP OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DON'T TORRENT THANK FOR **** YOUR HISTORY AND THE STORY. KNOW THE VALUE OF SAFETY. THANK THANK YOU. SO THANK MEMBER DEL TORO AND I THINK AT THIS POINT WERE HERE TO TAKE PICTURES. RECEIVE A QUESTIONS FROM A OFTEN YOURSELF WILL THANK YOU AND THEN THANK YOU ALSO FOR THE- THE GREAT THE- REVIEW REPORT. AND THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT I SPENT. VERY CALM. THANK YOU IS WHAT PROFILE DONE AND THIS FOR A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT IT DOES RAISE THE FROM QUESTIONS. OF THAT CAM CAME ABOUT. THE. IN IN FOR THE WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR US TO AND I WANTED TO WELCOME CENTER GALGIANI. GOOD MORNING. SO IT THE END AND I WANT TO ENSURE. THAT TO YOUR BEST POSITIONED TO BE SIX UP. FUTURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH. THE AS LEGISLATION MAY COME FROM OUR CONVERSATION THEY ENSURE THAT IN YOUR BOARDS FOR US. FROM HOW WE GENERALLY THINK OF SAFETY REGULATION MEETING NOT JUST ENFORCEMENT FOCUSED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT I GOT FOR YOU OF THE BOARD IN THE ROOM. FROM THE ANALYSIS. AT MISS OUR FRONT- PLEADED PUT TOGETHER SO YOU'RE VERY THOROUGH REVIEW USES AN ANALOGY OF. TO DESCRIBE THIS PHILOSOPHY WHERE THE GOAL. IS TO GET EVERYONE AND I THINK THAT'S INTRODUCED. EVER FELT THAT THEY WERE SAFE IS THE- THEY ARE. THEY DON'T LOOKS EIGHT HOURS WE ARE. GET EVERYONE TO SLOW DOWN AND PAY ATTENTION RATHER THAN ONLY GOOD ON WHO'S TO BLAME AND HOW WE'RE GONNA JUST THROUGH THAT INTERSECTION FELT. SLOW DOWN AND PAY ATTENTION RATHER THAN SOLELY SOLELY A FOCUS ON WHO IS TO BLAME WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE. IN THE EXCAVATION SPACE. TO THIS CHANGE YOUR ORIENTATION. BECAUSE AS WE KNOW LIABILITY WITH. YOUR ASPECT OF WHERE WE WERE GOING BUT ORANGE WE TALKED TO THE EVERYONE WAS LOOKING TO AVOID A LOT. SO WHAT IS BEEN. SEEMS BUILDING TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. IS AN- ESSENTIAL TO SHIFT MINDSETS SO WHAT ARE YOUR SUCCESSES THUS FAR. BUILDING TRUST AND HOW CAN THE SUCCESSES BE EXPANDED HOW BEYOND WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE SUCCESSES OF KIND OF CHANGING THAT MINDSET OF JUST I'M AFRAID I DON'T DO THIS OR I WANT TO SAY THIS BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE STUCK WITH THE LIABILITY. AND THAT'LL PREVENT ME SO HOUSE AT WORK. OF. TERRIFIED YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHERE WE'VE SO FAR IN THE MANDATES THAT WE ARE FACED. TO GET ACCESS IS OF EVERY AMERICAN TO A PATIENT. I WITH YOU KNOW THE ULTIMATE WOMAN XIN AND GETTING THE WORD OUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT OUR BOARD MEETINGS AS% THERE'S A GREAT AMOUNT OF PARTICIPATE IN ALL STAKEHOLDERS BUT WE KNOW THAT WERE WERE STILL MISSING SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS OUT THATALSO WHO IN PARTICULAR I MEAN I AND I DON'T I HE TO HAVE YOU CALL THAT OUT BUT WHO WOULD YOU SAY IS AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE PLANE. IT. OR CALL THEM RESPONSIBLE UP THERE THE. IGNITION OR RESPONSIBILITY OR FOR OF ASIAN BUT- WHERE WILL THEY CHARGE WE CAME TO MIND FOR ME WAS THAT YOU KNOW THEY- DID THIS IN. THE INITIAL PERSON WHO'S- YOU KNOW WHAT I DID IN MY BACKYARD A LOT AND. ACTUALLY MY WIFE ALWAYS SAYS TREE FROM FIVE PLANNED BUT- IT SO WHEN I'M DIGGING A HOLE OR- WORKING ON SOMETHING IS THAT AN AREA THAT THE COMMISSION AND WHERE ARE THOSE THOSE CHALLENGES INFORMATION IN TERMS OF. THE HOST OF A CURRENTLY ARE RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE DIRECT REGULATION OVER THE HOME. WE DO HAVE OVER A- A PROPERTY OWNER OF LIVE WHO OWNS A SECOND HOME OR DOES A RIVETING KIND OF WORK. BUT CURRENTLY HAVE NO OF THAT. HOMEOWNERS ARE EXEMPT FROM THAT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE TO THEY THEY THEY THEIR EXAM FROM THE REGULAR XIN REGULATION. WE WANT THEM TO CALL YOU WOULD LIKE TO. THEM A CALL YEAH. TWO OTHER OTHER AREAS. PROFESSIONS THAT ARE NOT AS RESPONSIVE. BECAUSE OF EITHER THEY'RE NOT AWARE OR THEY'VE JUST CULTURALLY IN. FELT EXEMPT OR NOT SEEN THE NEED. CAN I JUMP IN I THINK WE SEEN SENATOR HELL THAT. THE. THE PARTICIPANTS TO SHOP THEM UP TO HER THE GAS UTILITY CERTAINLY TELECOMMUNICATIONS. SOME OF THE CONTRACTORS- AND RIGHT AND OF STILL SHOW UP WE TEND TO HAVE. WE TEND TO NEED TO HEAR MORE FROM THE EXCAVATION SIDE AND THE OPERATOR SIDE AND I DON'T KNOW MADE MEMBER. THE END THE ENDS WE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE MEANS WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO GET AGRICULTURAL STATION. WE HAD HOW MANY OUTREACH EVENTS. FARM FARM- FARM BUREAU MEETINGS ACROSS THE STATE. FARM SHOWS A SURVEYS A SO THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT WE HAVE A HAD A FAIR AMOUNT OF. THEN TAKE A LOT OF EFFORT COM. START INTO THE SPECIALLY CONTRACTORS OUR MAIN THERE'S SOME CONNECTIONS THERE. KEEPING FENCING. THIS WE HAVE HAD. AND PRO ACTIVELY COMING OUT MEETING SOME FROM THEM- WE COULD USE MORE PARTICIPATION FROM FOR INSTANCE WATER- OUT YOU KNOW WHAT SYSTEM OPERATORS. I THINK THAT. WELL THERE IS THERE IS THERE IS. EIGHT GROUP AND. IN A SENSE WERE REALLY ONLY SCRAPING SURFEIT OF PHILLY DO NEED THAT TO TALK TO EITHER AT OUR MEETINGS OR GOING OUT TO ME OKAY I'M GLAD YOU'RE SCRAPING THE SERVICE BECAUSE IF YOU GO. CALL A ONE ONE. THAT IN AND THAT'S GOOD I THINK WHEN WE- IN ANOTHER CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD IS HERE AND WE'LL BE CHATTING WITH THEM. ENGINE TO SEE HOW WE CAN WORK WITH THEM. TO BE PUT ME AYE THAT MONTH. CONTRACTOR IN AND- YEAH I REMEMBER THE TEST. FACE TO THE TEST WHEN IT LEGAL PARK THE OTHER IS THAT THE PRACTICAL PARDON THE PROFESSIONAL PART IN IF THERE'S SOME WAY IN THAT LEGAL PART THAT THERE COULD BE REFERENCES TO ON THOSE EXAMS THAT AFTER THAT THERE IS A FOR THE WITH THE WITH THE LAW IS ONE AND WITH THIS IS A SAFETY PRACTICES SHOULD BE. SO WE'LL WE'LL DISCUSS THAT THE. LATER CENTER HAVE I MAY WE ARE DOING. BURKE AS FAR AS THE ISSUE PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HEAR EVERYBODY'S VOICES FOR INSTANCE WE'VE HELD TEN MEETINGS JUSTICE YOUR BOARD MEETINGS OPEN FORM IN THERE LASSEN COUPLE DAYS EACH TIME. ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT I PERSONALLY GONE AND- SOME OTHER BOARD MEMBERS HAVE GONE. TO THE CALIFORNIA WATERMARK ASSOCIATION CONSISTENTLY I AM PART OF ORGANIZATION ON THE CURRENT STATION A TEACHER FOR ABOUT. SO I HAVE MADE EVERY EFFORT US BIG SPOKEN IN THREE DIFFERENT BILL OTHER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS MANY BOARD MEMBERS HAVE DONE OUTRAGE SO. CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE MAKING EVERY. POSSIBLE STEP SURE THAT THAT EVERYBODY COMMUNICATION IS THERE AND- BE. PERHAPS TO GET BACK TO YOUR FIRST POINT ON THE QUESTION OF LIABILITY YES HOW DO PEOPLE FEEL- WHAT IS THE RESPONSE AND OUR MESSAGE VERSUS. ALIVE. I THINK PART OF TOWN LEAVE AT THE END. TALKING TO PEOPLE IS THERE STILL THANK YOU HI BILLY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM AND THE WHEN WE WITH OUR MESSAGE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT YEAH- AND IN SOME STE RESPECT THAT'S JUST GONNA TAKE TIME- THAT'S GOT A FAST- TRUST IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE YOU CAN'T. RUN RUN A PIECE. TO GET MORE TRUST. ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN STATE. THAT THAT IS NOTHING. WORK UP TO GET IT. WELL THAT'S GOOD I MEAN YOU CERTAINLY UP TO TWO YEAR START ON THAT- TO GAIN THE TRUST THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT QUESTION ENGINE DIDN'T IN YOUR IN YOUR REPORT THE TOP FIVE SAFETY ISSUES. HOW IT IS NOT CURRENT. FIREMAN TO CALL EIGHT ONE ONE TO REPORT DAMAGES BECAUSE- IT IS SPECULATED THAT THE DAMAGES GO ON REPORT. IN CERTAINLY WOULD JEOPARDIZE HIS SAFETY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVING IF NOTHING REPORTED HOW WOULD OF REQUIREMENT. BERMAN TO CALL IT AND ONE REPORT DAMAGES BE RECEIVED BY THE EXCAVATION COMMUNITY WITH. JOSH INCREASED LIABILITY POSITION. FEEL OF THAT. SO. SO THE BOARD HAS- IS IN THE PROCESS AND WERE ANTICIPATING OB GET FINAL APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY. FOR BEING ENFORCED VERY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY A REQUIREMENT THAT THE- ANYONE WHO HITS A GAS PIPELINE. FOR IS INVOLVED AN EXCAVATION THAT. THE INJURY THAT THOSE. THAT THEY HAVE TO CALL IT ONE ONE OR CONTACT A ON ONE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE DAMAGE INFORMATION WITHIN TWO HOURS. IS JUST A GAS. IT IS RARELY GAS. IT IS- IS GAS AND THEN IT'S. REQUIRINGOVERNIGHT HOSPITALIZATION OR MEDICAL CARE I BELIEVE AND FIGURE OUT. THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE HITS THAT WERE NOT CAPTURING IN THE MANDATORY REPORTING I THINK A LOT OF IT WAS. HARD SOLD FOR. ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES FOR STRUCTURE BUT. WE WILL HAVE A REGULATION IN EFFECT. FIRST FOR MANDATORY REPORTING OF THOSE DAMAGES AND THE ONE. TRANSMITTER ARE DIRECTLY TO US. YEAH I GUESS FOR ME THE QUESTION COMES TO MIND OF THE GAP. ISSUE I MEAN I JUST RECENTLY MET THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS VERY SERIOUSLY BURNED IN THAT EFFORT UNDERGROUND. A FRENCH FOREIGN YES IT WAS EXT IN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. AND THE. SO IT KIND OF BROUGHT THAT HOME TO ME THAT IT COULD BE ELECTRICAL AS WELL THANK YOU. YES SENATOR GALGIANI. YOUR MOST WHAT WHAT COMES TO MIND TO ME IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. YOU CAN MAKE THE REQUIREMENT BUT IF PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AIDS IT WILL. BE MINE FOR SOMEBODY AND THEY WOULD. INNOCENTLY JUST NOT JUST NOT FOLLOW THE LAW BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW BUT GIVEN THE BIRDS THAT WERE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE STATE. COUPLE IN FACT TO MAKE THIS MORE PUBLIC AND REMIND PEOPLE OF. THIS PAST AND CONNECTEDWITH WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING. I THINK TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR FOLKS IT WOULD IT WOULD BE A CAUTIONARY WARNING AND PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY PARANOID ABOUT ANY KIND OF THAT- INTRUSION I GAS LINE AFTER THAT. SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO EDUCATE FOLKS AND MAKE IT MORE PROMINENT IN THE MEDIA SOME PEOPLE THINK ABOUT IT. WELL I'M IN AND I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONFIDENTIAL SAFETY REPORTING PROGRAM THAT. WITH THE BETWEEN FAA AND NASA. AND THIS IS NOT A- BOOK FOR LOWER PROGRAM AS WE KNOW BUT A CLOSE ALL REPORTING SYSTEM FOR NEAR MISS EVENTS. THINK THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM COULD BE USEFUL IN THE EXCAVATION SPACE WOULD THIS BE A BETTER. WORSE THAN REQUIRING EXCAVATORS TO CALL EIGHT ONE FOLLOWING INCIDENT. THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION SENATOR. THE CLOSE CALL REPORTING SYSTEM I KNOW WHEN THE AT START UP IT DID TAKE THEM Là MAYBE DECADES TO RAMP UP- AND THE BIGGEST PART THAT WAS THAT PEOPLE OF WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION ONE SIMILAR TO WHERE WHERE WHEN FROM THEY DID NOT SAY TRUST IT BECAUSE- IT WAS A NEW TYPE OF. TELLING ON PEOPLE. AND THEY DIDN'T TRUST THE PROCESS WOULD BE. CONFIDENTIAL FOR THEM- THEY DON'T TRUST THAT THE PURPOSE WAS REALLY JUST A PICTURE OF PEOPLE- THAT WE HAD IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INDUSTRY AND IT WASN'T IN BLANK. AND SO. ANY EFFORT THAT WE HAD RUN IN THIS THING. IT IS PERHAPS A HARD FOR ME RIGHT NOW TO GET MY MIND AROUND. WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COAL THAT'S HOW I WOULD WORK. BUT I THINK IT MAKES SENSE. NO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND WORKING ON IT. AS ECHO I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE STATUS ON IT BUT IT MIGHT BE REASONABLE TO START OUT THAT THIS AT LEAST PICK ONE INDUSTRY. MAYBE. ONE INDUSTRY WITH A SMALL OUT OF OPERATOR TO OUR SMALL AMOUNT OF. OF PLAYERS. THAT IT EASIER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MAN JUST. WHILE I MAY BE OPEN TO A- ROLL OUT THE MESSAGING- GRADUALLY IN MANY YEARS. IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE YOUR SAFETY CULTURE THAT REALLY DOES PRIOR TIES. MAKING SURE THAT WORK. I. CONTINUING THE COMMUNICATION I THINK THAT. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER THAT'S REALLY THE WAY THE DIRECTION. YEAH I KNOW YOU'VE ALWAYS FELT THE NOTICED AND APPRECIATED BEST OF THAT THE THAT PROGRAM. LOOKING AT EDUCATION HERE FOR DETAILED DIRECTIONS OF EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT AND IT'S BEEN A REAL PRIORITY. THE NO DOUBT THE FIRST FEW YEARS AND PERHAPS MORE OF THE BOARD NEEDS TO LET IN THE IN THE EXT COMMUNITY KNOW YOU EVEN EXISTENCE WHAT YOUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE IF AS- AS A TRUE THE TRAGEDY IN. WHERE SOLAR INSTALLATION WORK HAS BEEN REPORTED AS THE ORIGIN OF THE- FOR US THERE COULD BE MANY BUSINESSES NOT TRADITIONALLY CONSIDERED. INVOLVED IN EXCAVATION. WOULD BENEFIT FROM YOUR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH SIMILAR TO BATTLE EARLIER WHAT PORTS PLANS FOR REACHING THESE AN ANTICIPATED ENTITIES. WE HAVE THANK YOU. WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXTENSIVELY FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS OF. THE BOARD BEING TOGETHER. ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS THAT ONE OF THINGS WERE YOU WANT TO DO WHEN WE GO OUT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT SPEAKS DIRECTLY. THE INDUSTRIES THAT THING WITH. I'VE BEEN IN THE EDUCATIONAL. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND ONE THING THAT I ASSISTED IN THE- CATION COMMITTEE ALONG WITH OUR FELLOW MEMBER JOHNSON. ONE THING IS A BOARD THAT WE. WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS WE OF COURSE ARE DOING REGION. WE ARE SPEAKING TO IT THREE AND ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES. WAS AS WELL. DIFFERENT ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS TO PROMOTE EDUCATION US THAT THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH COOKIE CUTTER ONE THING THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IN THE BOARD WANTS TO MAKE SURE BEFORE WE ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT ONLY AFFECT OF. AN EFFICIENT AND THAT IT ACTUALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE. WE WANT TO TAKE THE SPORT A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THAT'S MISSING IS AS YOU KNOW WE ARE. DIVERSE STATE AS MANY CULTURES. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT. THIS HAPPENED WITHIN A MY PERSONAL LIFE IS BECAUSE THE TRAINING WILL AFFECT TO INDUSTRY WAS IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY WOULD UNDER AND THAT'S TRULY. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT. ISSUES THAT HAVE. HE LOOKED OUT WE WANTED AS A BOARD TO GO OUT AND CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS SPECIFIC TO INDUSTRY. SPECIFIC TO CULTURE. AND SPEAKS A DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ONE THING BEING THAT I AM. CAN ONE THAT SPEAKS TO MY CULTURE FIRST. AND AT HOME TO FOUND. IT'S WHY I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO THAT. THE THING THAT WE WANT TO GO OUT OF SUPPORT. FOR THAT ARE FOR. AND TO SAY WE WANT TO GET YOU HOME TO YOUR- THAT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN GOING. THESE ARE THE REGULATIONS THIS IS WHAT SHE SHOULD. LAW I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AS A BOARD DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT. IS SPEAKING TO THE NOT ONLY TO THE EMPLOYEE BUT TO THE- POLICE. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. WE LOOK. FOR AVENUES ONLY FOUND THAT. THE BEST RESOURCES TO DEVOTE OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE HERE WITH IT. OR WE HAVE THE TALENT. WE HAVE AND. TO FOCUS ON THAT WOULD HAVE HAD OUR ANNUAL EDUCATE. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WITH SIX FULL FORMS OF THIS LAST WEEK WE HAD IT LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER PART IN THE TURNOUT WAS INCREDIBLE. SO THE COMFORT LEVEL IT THERE WE ARE HEARING THE VOICES OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS- MORE THAN SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. GUN BUT THAT. IN THE FOREFRONT AND. IT'S PROGRAMS ONLY ABOUT. TRIED TO THINK ABOUT ALL THIS AND TRY TO KEEP IT ALL TOGETHER OUR HEAD. WELL WE DECIDED WE COULDN'T AND SO WE DEVELOP THE AN EDUCATIONAL RICH PLAN OUR EDUCATION OUR TO OFFICER KRISTEN Là THOMAS AND PUT IT TOGETHER. ON PAGE EIGHTY SIX THE REPORT ABOUT A GRAPH OF THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT REALLY. IT REALLY HAS TO COME IN THREE PHASES FIRST WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY OF THE NEEDS AND WE HEAR THE NEEDS OF HERE CALL IT WONDER WHERE I HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL THESE OTHER NONTRADITIONAL STAKEHOLDERS OF THE SECOND IS TO DEVELOP THE MATERIALS TO REACH THEM AND- THIS IS A FLY. A. I'LL CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE IN THE APPOINTMENT. DID WITH HELPING THE EDUCATION HOURS PLAN. AS YOU TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT IDENTIFY COM BUT THE THINGS THAT WERE GOING TO LOOK AT NOW AND- HOPING TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE THE TIME AND RESOURCES TO DO SO. THIS WE NEED TO DEVELOP INVEST IN PRESENT. FOR DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS INVESTIGATION. THAT MATERIAL AND RESTING GATORS TO HAVE WITH THEM IN THEIR CARS WHEN THEY GO OUT TO PROVIDE- THE PEOPLE THEY'RE ACTING BECAUSE IN. RIGHT NOW OUR INVESTIGATORS ARE. WHICH ON THE GROUND THERE THERE THE FACE OF. PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE INTERACTING STAKEHOLDERS. AND WORSE MORE STILL AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY THE MEANS. DURING THAT APPOINTMENT WE HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR INSTANCE- CITIES ARE GOING TO BE A MAJOR SOURCE A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY DO ONE THING OR ONE KIND OF EXCAVATION. OPERATORS ARE EXCAVATOR OF MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND CITIES HAVE OTHER OTHER THAN DAY TO. THERE THERE OF. MAJOR YOU CAN KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ON BOARD THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR FALLING BEST PRACTICES THAT WE THINK IT'S GONNA A LOT IT'S GOING TO FLOW FROM THERE AND WERE. THE STRATEGIES THAT WILL. JUST TO FIND SOME. SOME CITIES THAT ARE ONE OF THE MODEL CITIES TO START WORKING ON ON ALL THE DETAILS OF THE WE MIGHT. SENATORS TELLING GALGIANI. IF YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME INTRODUCTIONS. AS A FIVE SOME CITIES AT RISK TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT AND DEAL WORK. THANK YOU AND THE- IT ALONG THOSE LINES THE COMMON GROUND ALLIANCE SPENDS QUITE A BIT OF RESOURCES IN TIME PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN ISRAEL NO WHERE DOES THE BOARDS FOR THIS ONE OUT REACH DIFFER FROM CJ'S ON ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO LET SOME OF WHAT THE WORK THE TGA DOES A OR OTHER STILL COLD STAKEHOLDERS IN THAT OUR- EFFORT. THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE YES CJ. DROP A PRINTER. MISSION SIX. AND WE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS BERMAN AND FOUND THAT IT'S JUST GREAT WORK WHAT THEY'VE DONE. HOWEVER WHAT'S GOING DIFFERENT OF OUR- WE'LL BE. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AND WE HAVE WE HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT GENERATIONAL. FOLKS WORKING IN OUR WORKPLACE RIGHT WE HAVE FROM GENERATION Z. TO BABY BOOMERS THAT ARE STILL IN THE WORKPLACE AND WHAT Là ORGANIZATIONS FILTER RECOGNIZES THAT THE LEARNING STYLES ARE DIFFERENT THE PRESENT TIONS ARE DIFFERENT YOU CAN'T HAVE THE TYPE OF TRAINING THAT YOU HAD. YOUR BACK IN WITH THESE PROFESSIONALS AS THEY DO WITH THE YOUNG FOLKS SO WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE RELEVANT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE I'VE DOCUMENTED CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THAT SO. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM THERE'S GREAT RESOURCE ISSUE WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND. REQUIREMENTS IS THAT. WHEN I THINK ABOUT CGA THAT'S THE FIRST THING I THINK ABOUT IS THAT STICKER. STICKER AND CJ WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ACTION THE EIGHT ONE ONE NUMBER BEFORE. I WAS A TO THAT EIGHT I THINK YOU JUST HAD TO FIND THE RIGHT NUMBER OF THE CALL CENTER IN REGARD TO MARKET ATTEND. BUT THAT'S IF. THAT'S THEIR THING THAT'S WHERE THEY THEY DO WELL IF YOU DON'T. THAT APPLIES TO YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T THEN. AND WHERE WE NEED AND. AND THE CALLING IS. THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE SAFETY. FATALITIES. IT REALLY IS EXCAVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE'S BEEN ISSUES BETWEEN OUR X. RETURN OPERATOR THAT LED TO WELL NEVER JUST ONE THING BUT A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT LED TO THE ACCENT ACT HAPPENING AND SO THAT'S WHY- WHILE THE EDUCATE PROGRAM NEEDS TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT APPLIES TO THEM TO CALL THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE SAFETY EVEN AFTER THE CALL. IT'S VERY GOOD. I WANTED TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO DISCUSS THE YOU KNOW YOUR DECISION TO CONDUCT YOUR EDUCATION IN LIEU OF FINE IN HOUSE RATHER THAN OUTSOURCED TRAINING OF WHAT LED THE BOARD TO. CHOOSE THAT OPTION. WE WANT TO BE FREE OF FAIR BOARD WE WANT TO BE A BOARD THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE COMING TO US WE- I'M A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER I WORK WITH A SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED SAYS AND ONE. CONTINUE TO HERE IS YOU KNOW ARE WE DEVELOPING ANOTHER ORGANIZATION THAT'S JUST GOING TO THE DOCTOR. FINDS ON FAMILIAR WITH CAL OSHA AND. BUT THEY'RE KNOWN FOR TO COME AND IN A WELCOME THEM. IN IN LIEU YOU KNOW IN FEAR OF THAT THEM FOR FINDING SOMETHING THAT WE WANT THEM TO. SO OUR APPROACH IS REALLY FOCUSING ON EDUCATION BECAUSE THAT'S TRULY WITH. WE GO ON OUT IN THE FIELD WITH WHAT I CALL THE BOOTS ON THE GROUNDS ON A DAILY BASIS. YOU'RE NOT AWARE AND IT WOULD HAVE A STAYS UP WITH THE LEADERSHIP THEY DO THE REQUIRED TRAINING AS FAR. OSHA REQUIRES HOWEVER IT DOESN'T SEEM TO TRICKLE DOWN ON ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE TO THE BOOTS. AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO REACH THOSE AND ONE THING ONLY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT ON THE WAY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO OPEN OUR DOORS OR THEIR DOORS TO US AND LISTEN TO US. KNOW THAT WE'RE HERE TO EDUCATE THEIR WILL TO MAKE CHANGE POSITIVE. OF COURSE FINES ARE PART OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO BUT I REALLY I THE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I'M- I WAS PROUD TO BE SERVE ON THIS BORDERS SO I REALLY WANT TO BRING THAT ATTENTION- I'M OUT THERE I'M LISTENING TO. YOU ALL THE FRONTLINE WORKERS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE CAN REACH THEM WE'VE DONE AN EXEMPLARY JOB WITH THE. HOW IN A LARGE AND MIDDLE MANAGEMENT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN SOMEHOW. INFILTRATE AND MAKE SURE THEY REALIZE THAT OUR GOAL IS A BOARD IS TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND SAVE THEIR LIVES. AND I THINK. WHEN WE STARTED GOING UP PATH WE OVER THE INITIAL TAKE WELL AS- CONTRACTED OUT BUT WE. A WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE CAUGHT UP ON THAT THAT IS BECAUSE. DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS AREA IT'S. YOU KNOW IT'S CALLING ON THE SISTER AND ITS LISTING CO SECTIONS ON A POWER POINT WHICH SOME PEOPLE WILL GET BY USUALLY BUT NOT PEOPLE ARE TENDER. SO. AT THREE PERCENT SIX MONTHS AND TO FIND. A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE. AS CONTRACTORS AND- WE WERE DOING THIS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MESSAGE WAS. WE A WE FELT WILL BE JUST AS HARD. ALSO SET AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP. AS A BE JUST THE TO DO IT ON OUR OWN IN AND REYES KLAY. THE BEST RESOURCES IN THIS AREA- WHO UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE CAN HELP US DELIVER OUR OUR BOARD MEMBERS. YEAH BECAUSE THERE. IN WHICH YOU WANT WHEN THE INITIAL EFFECTIVE MET THAT WERE YOU GUYS WERE THINKING. AERIALS WE ARE TO OUR EDUCATE. YEAH DONE A GREAT JOB DOING THEIR DUTY. WE'RE IMPLEMENTING Là THE RECENT NOT FOR THE THING IN THE LIVE ARGUMENT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE AS WE MOVE FORWARD THERE'S GOING TO BE INTO THIS JUST LIKE THIS WITH MARK MARIETTA WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO. BRING THOSE ON STORIES IN FRONT OF THEM SO. ONE OF THE THESE WERE DOING THAT AND SHE JUST WE WANTED. LOOKING AT MEMBERS IN IMPLEMENTING THAT INTO OUR METHODS SO OUR APPROACH OF COURSE READ REVIEWS UTORRENT WE ARE GOING TO REVIEW SOME SAFE PRACTICES THAT'S PART OF THE CURRICULUM IS A GIVEN BUT. MAKES A PERSONAL TO THEM AND WE FEEL THAT. THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IT. SEVERAL COURSES. YOU CAN IMAGINE AND WE NEED TO BE DIFFERENT AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THAT SOMEHOW. WE HAVE A CUP- MEANS THAT THAT TALK ABOUT AND I THINK NUMBER DEL TORY WITH FIRST THE SAME THAT. IN JUST EXIT SURVEYS OF THE EIGHT MOST LEADING INDICATE. ON THE LOW. COURSE IS DO THEY VIOLATE AGAIN THE REAL. REAL SUCCESS. BETWEEN THE SURVEY RESPONSE AND THE. THE RESULT OF WHETHER IT MIGHT COME BACK FOR THE BOARD HAS A VIOLATION- WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE ABOUT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IT IS ALWAYS NO NO ONE IS THAT. TRAFFIC ALL SURE THAT STOPS YOU. IF THAT WEREN'T. IT'S EFFECTIVE TO A POINT. BUT TENDS TO THINK LONGER WE HAVE IT MARKED AS A NATION AND I'M BRINGING THAT EXPERIENCE IS ONE OF THE REASON I'M ON THE SPORT. MEASURE OF. METHODS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE. SO WE'LL BE BRINGING SOME OF THOSE. YEARS OF STEP IN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WE'RE LOOKING SOME- WE HAVEN'T QUITE DEEPLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE MIDDLE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON THIS PROGRAM. THERE ARE METHODS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND I LOOK FOR TO REPORTING ON YOU FUTURE AND ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT AS YOU MENTIONED. THANK SENATOR HELL. RIGHT NOW GAS INCIDENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED. INVESTIGATORS ARE. THE NICE PART OF THIS BOARD IS THAT. EVEN OUR LIGHTING METRICS TEND TO BE LEADING WORDING IS TO- OTHER AGENCIES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST THEIR WHEN SOMETHING BLOWS UP. SO. IT'S ALSO PART OF. THE ONLY REASON REALLY BE EDUCATION FIRST IS BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING OUT THERE AND ARE BEHAVING ACCIDENTS THAT DON'T SHOW OF OTHER AGENCIES. IF WE WERE EDUCATION FIRST AND ONLY INVESTIGATED. CAN ACCIDENTS HERE I THINK YOU PROBABLY CALL US BACK. RIGHT PROBABLY THROUGH- DO YOU FOR THIS THE ASIAN IN LIEU OF FINDS. DO YOU FIND A CURE FOR SEE ANY OF THE AGENCIES THAT INFO ASHRAFI I'M ASKED THEM LETTER TO BUT- SEE THAT IS A POSSIBLE. IN THIS SPACE AND MY EXPERIENCE THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN OKAY WE FOUND A VIOLATION OR AN EVENT AND THEN HERE'S THE PUNISHMENT. AND OF THAT SPACE WELL AS. THAT THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION TO BRING TO SAY- IS AVAILABLE BUT NO IS DOING SUGGESTION. IN A LOTTERY TAX I THINK OUR AGENCIES THUS FAR HAVEN'T HAD THE TOOL. TO DO PROACTIVE SAFETY EDUCATION CULTURE FOCUSED. BUT I THINK IT WILL WHAT'S THEY START GETTING TOOLS FOR INSTANCE OR ITS DEVELOPMENT OF THIS EDUCATION LOW FINANCE COURSE THE MATERIAL THAT. BOARD AND STAFF IS DEVELOPING FOR DOING MORE EDUCATION. DO YOU THINK IT'S BEEN A OF COOL THAT'S HAMSTRUNG THEM MORE THAN NECESSARY A. DIFFERENCES IN MINES THAT THE LACK CREATED THAT DIFFERENCE. THE DISTRIBUTOR WELL WANTED. WHO RESOURCES WITHIN THE AGENCY AND AS I LOOK THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT IT IN LOOKING AT THE FINANCES AND THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IT IS IT'S SO IT ISN'T SPECIFIC REGARDING. SOME OF THE DETAILS SO IF YOU COULD KIND OF. LOOK AT THAT AND PROVIDE THAT TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE. AT A LATER DATE THIS LITTLE MORE GRANULAR. DETAILS OF THAT I'VE CREATED CLICK ON ADD THINK PART OF IT WAS THAT- WITH BEING PART OF CAL FIRE AND FISCALE JUST ROLLING OUT MORE A LITTLE LATE ON OUR NUMBERS AND SO- WE ONLY WORK WITH THE WITH YOU IN THE COMMITTEES. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT INFORMATION YOU REALLY NEED AND GET TO. THE JANUARY TENTH. INFORMATION COMES OUT IT ALSO TERM. HIGHLIGHTS THE EXIST. FUNDING DEFICITS THAT THE OUR PRESIDENT MAKES A CASE FOR WHY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONDITION SHOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN APPROPRIATIONS WHAT DOES THE BOARD NEED ASIDE FROM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MEET ITS OPEN MANDATE. TRUMP. SO AND THE GREAT. EXACTLY IN YOUR POWER. MAYBE THE BIGGEST THING IS JUST INFORMATION WE NEED. IT'S NOT AN ACT WHERE THERE IS SOME DATA ON DEGGANS BUT IT'S NOT REALLY GREAT COMMON GROUND ALLIANCE AS HAVE A- WHAT'S VOLUNTARY- IT'S DONE VERY DIFFERENT FROM. FROM REPORTER HARPER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SELECT ABOUT HIS. AS TALK ABOUT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. THEN A LITTLE BACKING AND PROVIDING THEM OF REAL PROPOSAL ONLINE. FIRING DAMAGE REPORTS SO THAT'S GOING TO HELP IT AND SO. TICKET DATA IS GOING TO REALLY HELP WILL HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHO IS CALLING IF WE SEE WHO IS CALLING TELL WHO'S NOT CALLING SO INFORMATION. IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL LAW CHANGES AS YOU KNOW AS WE GO WE FIND MORE AND MORE THINGS. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS BRING UP MORE AND MORE ISSUES THAT. ARE RELEVANT FOR US TO LOOK INTO AND THAT MIGHT REQUIRE CHANGES IN IN STATUTE. AND WE CAN AS WE GO WE CAN DEFINITELY PROVIDE YOU- SOME OF THAT QUESTION ABOUT. VACUUM EXCAVATION AND. WE'RE SEEING WITH THE BOARDS DOWN WHERE AB NINETEEN FOR. POWER THANK YOU MAY BE REACHED. THAT THE BOARD HAS CONSIDERED IT AND REALLY NEED DISCUSS BEFORE WE MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. THERE ARE SOME OTHER. OF FROM. I GUESS THE MOST MINOR I THINK. THE HAVING ALMOST AS A DBA AND STAFF IT MIGHT HELP AS DICK SAFE FOR THEIR SOME ODD ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGES TO NOT GOING BY THE NAME THAT'S IN STATUTES. THE FROM THE MOST MINOR. I THINK AND WE HAVE A COLLECTED COUNTY MONEY BUT THE PENALTY MONEY THAT IS COLLECTED- NOT JUST BY US BUT BY OUR PARTNER AGENCIES PC FOR MARSHALL AND CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD GOES THE STATE FEE TO TARGETED EDUCATION OUTREACH GRANTS IT MIGHT BE GOOD TO. EXPAND WHAT THOSE CAN BE FOR- INTO AND BUT WE'RE KIND OF THINKING IS MORE RESEARCH OUR SAFETY RELATED RESEARCH MIGHT BE GOOD. WE'VE RUN INTO A QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS ARE REALLY OUR AUTHORITY TO COLLECT CIVIL PENALTIES THE BOARD RIGHT. OR DID HAS DIRECT ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OF REALLY ONLY A SMALL SLIVER OF THE GROUPS THAT IT. DOESN'T CATIONS ON IF YOU'RE A- LOOK UTILITY OUR INVESTIGATIONS WITH AND GO TO THE PC FOR THEM TO DO ENFORCEMENT IF YOU'RE A CONTRACTOR INVESTIGATION GO CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD. BUT THERE ARE SLIVER OF WE'RE ESTIMATING ABOUT 5% THAT OUR BOARD. BOARD ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. MAKE SURE THAT WE WHAT IS OUR AUTHORITY THANKS. WE MIGHT WANT TO JUST- REVISIT THAT AND EXPLORE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND- OUR ATTORNEYS AND COUNCIL MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS. OUT ONE OF THAT I DON'T THINK. MY POOR MEMBERS ALL MENTION BUT ALL MEN AND- THEY HAVE. THE FIRST YEAR THEY HAD NINE BOARD MEETING SIGN UP FOR THAT ONE DAY MEETINGS. MEETINGS AND THE OTHER ONES TODAY MEANS THIS YEAR ATTEND BOARD MEETINGS AND I THINK- MAYBE TWO OUT ONE DAY MEETING STRESSED TO ME TODAY MEETINGS. AND SO IT IS A QUITE A BIT OF A TIME. THAT THEY'RE MAKING FOR THIS. IT'S GOING TO COME IN THE FUTURE UNLIKE MOST OTHER BOARDS. THIS POOR IS SET UP TO HEAR CASES- IF SOMEBODY IF THERE'S A NOTICE OF PROPOSED. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE- WHAT AND FOR CENTER SECTION YOU'RE UNDER. AN EXCAVATOR OR AN OPERATOR QUE QUESTION. AND IT IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO THE BOARD BECAUSE. PEOPLE WHO ON'T GET HEARINGS ARE THE ONES WHO. AT THE LEAST MEANS OF IN THE SENSE THAT MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE SMALLEST IS AN X. RAY JUST HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE BOARD WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT THE OLDEST Là PENCIL FOR IT TO JUST OVERWHELM- THE TIME OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS AND SO WE MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE AT SOME POINT. WHETHER THERE ARE SOME. TYPES OF VIOLATIONS THE THINGS ARE THINKING ARE PARTICULARLY CALLS. THAT CAN REALLY BE DONE AS A MINUTE LEVEL I'M WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL TO THE BOARD. TAKING BOARD RESOURCES HERE- SOME OF THE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD CASE. SIR THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT THAT I'VE NOTHING YET. I THINK IT WOULD HELP. THE COMMITTEES ARE APPETITE BUT I THINK A BIGGER FIRST COME BACK IN THREE YEARS. OR WHATEVER IS APPROPRIATE. IT HELPS REALLY CRYSTALLIZE OUR FOR OUR PHONE PURPOSE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME AND VISIT HERE AGAIN. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE TIME. TO BRING US BACK. TO NO I THINK IT'S A HEALTHY WAY OF LOOKING AT THE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE FACED. CALIFORNIA IF YOU THE BARRIERS THAT ARE IN STATURE TODAY THAT COULD LIMIT YOUR RESOURCES- THINGS WE COULD DO PERHAPS TO THAT AND THE HIGHLIGHTED I THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S REPORT. HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED ANY OF THOSE ANYMORE BARRIERS OR THINGS THAT COULD BE DOING OR THAT. COULD BE CHANGED TO. IMPROVE INCREASE YOUR RESOURCES OR ENABLE A SMOOTHER. I THINK THE I MEAN ARE THE THING THAT CONCERNS US RAISES THE MOST IS NOT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT EDUCATION. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART FOR BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO START- WITH FINE SO WE HAVE A SHORT YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT JULY. TWENTY TWENTY WE NEED TO BE RICH. AS SOON AS WE GO OUT AND WE'RE TRULY IN EDUCATION AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. IS THE RESOURCES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED THAT SO IF I CAN ASK ANYTHING. OF THE BOARD THIS POINT IS ARE IS JUST LEGISLATURE'S THAT WE REALLY DO NEED THE ASSISTANCE TO DO THAT IT'S A LOT MORE TIME TO. REALIZE BUT WE'RE- READY TO DO THAT ANOTHER PART THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AS BOARD MEMBERS IS THE LACK OF ANALYTICAL DATA. IN ORDER. FOCUSED AND EFFICIENT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TARGETING. YOU KNOW INCIDENT AND WHAT'S MORE PROMINENT. WE HAVE A GREAT WE ARE STAKEHOLDER BEGIN BUT WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE EXCAVATORS PRESENT AND WE NEED TO HAVE A FAIR. OF FAIR WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR DATA WE HAVE PROVIDED MANY SURVEYS WHICH IS ASSISTED US BUT- RESOURCES FOR. THE COMMUTE HE WITH THE CALL CENTERS TO GET. DATA THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE STREAMLINED WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO GO DIG THROUGH OTHER RESOURCES WOULD BE GREAT. AND THEN JUST THE RESOURCE INTERNALLY TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS. TOGETHER OUR ONE OF OUR MAJOR. ISSUE. YEAH YOU'RE GONNA END UP AND IT WILL BE WITH THE SHEEP. IN EIGHTEEN AT THE. IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE OPEN AND THE GEISHA INTO P. JEANNIE LOCATE AND MARK PRACTICES THIS I THINK WE ALL FOLLOWED HOW IS THE CONSULTANT AND WERE YOU CONSULTED AS PART OF THAT INVESTIGATION. IS THAT ON. SO WE WERE NOT CONSULT SIR AND BRINGING THE ACTION AS YOU KNOW THE- FAMILY WAS AND LATER NINETEEN AND- IN WORKING ON THIS FOR AWHILE. AND OF COURSE ESPECIALLY WITH THE PEACE IT'S A- ACTION. IN A AND ALIVE IN ORDER CONSIDER INVESTIGATION IS REALLY BIG DEAL NAY. A RIFLE A STRONG LOCK ON INFORMATION ON THAT. WE HAVE. I WE'VE OFFERS- IF THERE'S AN WE CAN PROVIDE IT'S BEEN A LITTLE AWKWARD AND DO SOME WORK YOU'RE OUT WHO I CAN AND CAN'T TALK WORKS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ADVISORY PART AND ADVOCATE PART AND FIGURE OUT WHO WHO IS WHO. AND WE OFFERED AND. THAT THAT ARE FOR OUR OUR OTHER. THE BOARD'S WILLING. IT IS A SAFETY REGULATORY AGENCY HAVE YOU FOLLOW. MISSION SURROUNDING SAFETY IS TO MAKE. THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY LAST YEAR WHEN THEY CREATED TO. CONVERSATION YOU SEE A BENEFIT TO ALL SAFETY REGULATORS BEING HOUSED IN THE SAME OFFICE OR DIVISION. AND WHAT CHALLENGES MIGHT RECEIVE FROM THE. I THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY DO AND A LOT OF DEBT HE'S- FOR OVER A ACT OF AN INTERESTING MOM BECAUSE THE BOARD WAS CREATED. ACTUALLY COFFEE INVESTIGATIONS AND THEY EDUCATION THIS IS A OF THIS AREA. AND IT'S KIND OF AN INVESTIGATION EDUCATION HA WHERE WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE WITH THE P. C. C. ASSEMBLY AND- THE FIRE MARSHAL. SO IS WHAT MODEL THAT WORKS IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. I THINK IT. IT ENDS UP COMING TO DO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE THE RIGHT EXPERTISE THE RIGHT CULTURE. AND. I KNOW DISCUSSION BEEN HAPPENING IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. THE ADMINISTRATION'S WORKING HARD TO FIGURE OUT OF THIS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. TO IS THIS IS CERTAINLY. FOR ASSEMBLY HAPPY. I ANY DISTANCE TO THE COMMITTEES. AND OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION. TO HELP YOU COME WITH COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS TO THIS COMPLICATED DIFFICULT SITUATION. OKAY. ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD WITH THE TO WILL LET YOU. PLEASE I CAN HANG AROUND A LITTLE BETTER MAYBE. AFTER THE OTHER PANEL THE SECOND PANEL. EVERYONE MIND I JUST WANT TO ADD BACK ON THE EDUCATIONAL PIECE THE TRAILS IT LOOKED GO BACK TO THE REPORT LOOK AT PAGE EIGHTY SIX THERE'S CLEARLY. A BLOW IS THIS TYPE OF W. TO MANDATE OR YOU KNOW THAT TIME FRAME TO IT WAS A GRAY AND NUMBER IS MORE OF THE OF WHAT WE'D LIKE TO BOARD. AND I'M CONCERNED BEING THAT REPRESENTATIVE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME TO GET THE WORD OUT TO OUR AGRICULTURAL. IS THAT YOU KNOW COME. FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A REQUIREMENT THAT YOU CALL. AN ACE TICKET BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT. WE ARE TODAY WITH OUR REMOVING DIRT PUMP FASTER AS- FAR AS THEM TO DO THAT SO WE'RE GONNA BE CHALLENGES TO OUR- AND GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD. AND. INSIDE. INVOLVED THEY MEETINGS WITH A I HER CULTURAL AKA IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR SO I SEE PROGRESS BUT THE TIME THE TIME IS GOING TO BE- IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH CALL FOR ME WELL YOU KNOW LET ME KNOW AND THE COMMITTEE NOTE IF THERE'S THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN IN A NOTE SENATOR GALGIANI IS VERY CLOSE TO. THE AGRICULTURE. SAID A- RESIDENT WE CAN DO TO FACILITATE THAT ARE. RIGHT THAT YOU KEEP THAT THAT WORD A MESSAGE WILL BE HAPPY TO THAT. OF YOUNG AND ON THAT NOTE THE FARM BUREAU AND OTHER AG COMMODITY HAVE. MONTHLY NEWSLETTERS ARE YOU. REACHING OUT TO THEM AND POSTING ARTICLES. A YES- WE HAVE. ORIGINAL APPLE RETRACED A- ON THE VEHICLE. WE GOT SOME MIXED RESULTS FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTY FARM BUREAU'S BUT- THAT WAS ONE OF THE YOUR BILLS AT WORK TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT. I CAN'T DO WITHOUT THEM. YES THEY DO OF ACTUAL JOB OF GETTING THAT WORD OUT AND ANSWER ANY INSTANCES IN CASES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO SERVE ON THE BOARD AND FOR THE TIME COMMITMENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED. ALL OF US YOU'RE WELCOME. IN NOW INVITE THIS SECOND TO COME FORWARD. LOOKING AT THE ISSUE OF HOW CAN WE BETTER REMOTE THE XP PRACTICES. I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL TAKE FOR THEM JAMES WINGATE. THREE USA NORTH EIGHT WHAT. SINGLE STORY. BONTA. A GOOD GROUP OF PEOPLE AND INDIVIDUAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR. PARTICIPATING TODAY AND FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. WHEN THE WOULD YOU LIKE TO. START OFF TODAY. WHY ANALYST AT FIRST ON THE AGENDA SO I GUESS THAT WHAT I HAVE LIKE WHETHER I WANT TO WORK RIGHT. YOU COULD YOU COULD DIFFER THAT'S FINE SO. MY NAME IS JAMES WHEN GATE ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SAY NORTH EIGHT ONE ON SO I WANT TO START BY. REFRESHING YOUR MEMORY OF. THE NOTIFICATION CENTERS SO CAL YOU REGIONAL NOTICE SHOULD CENTER. ONE IN THE SOUTH IS CALLED UNDER SERVICE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMONLY KNOWN AS- THE COVER NINE COUNTY OTHER CALIFORNIAN ROUGHLY TWENTY TWO PEOPLE. I'M FROM UNDERGROUND SERVICE ALERT OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA WE COVER FOR NINE COUNTIES IN CENTRAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE STATE IN ABOUT A- WE SERVE ROUGHLY TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE. SEVENTEEN OF HOUSING. SO THIS YEAR THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE'VE WE'VE PROCESSED IN USA NORTH- OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OF COMING HERE WHICH MEANS THAT WHEN WE DELIVER OUT UTILITY OWNERS OF THE TICKET. WE SEND THAT OUT EIGHT UTILITIES PER TICKET THE AVERAGE IT BURIES FEWER IN RURAL AREAS MORE URBAN AREAS BUT OVERALL IS ROUGHLY EIGHT WE'VE HEARD OVER TWELVE MILLION TICKETS TO UTILITY ON HERE SO FAR. SO THE SCOPE IS MASSIVE THAT BEING. I AM IS ACTUALLY MUCH LOWER THAN IT SHOULD BE. TO OTHER STATES THE PAD. PROBABLY EVEN MORE- IT'S THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT OR POPULATIONS AND LOW GEOGRAPHY OR G. OF EXERCISE DO. TICKETS NORTH CAROLINA FOR EXAMPLE DO OVER TO ME IN THIS YEAR AND THEY ONLY HAVE. SO A OF PUBLIC. INVESTMENT AS OUR PAY IS THERE- WE HAVE WORK TO DO IN IN CALIFORNIA. REPORT HIGHLIGHTS. I CAN'T BECAUSE OF DAMAGES IS NO TICKET. OF ALL THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF WHICH IS. BY TAKING IN MANY. NOW DOWN INTO THE TWENTIES. AS FAR THE PERCENTAGES ARE TWENTY A LOT FOR THE PAST REGION'S AND- THOUGH WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HAS BEEN. THAT. EXIST WE'VE RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE SO BIG AND SO POPULOUS THAT WE WOULD NEED AN ARMY OF ON THEIR OWN PEOPLE DOING IT CATIA AND NOT JUST NOT REALISTIC FROM OF. USE AND TRY AND I'M NOT SAYING WE HAVEN'T TRIED BUT WE HAVE INVESTED LIKE A STATE HAVE INVESTED IN TERMS TEAMS OF PEOPLE AND- YOU KNOW THE. WE DEVELOPED AN ONLINE TRADING PLATFORM WE SPENT SIX MONTHS TWO. THOUSAND DOLLARS. IT TAKES THREE HOURS FOR THE USER TO COMPLETE AND WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY THOROUGH. EDUCATIONAL TOOL TO REQUIRE EXCAVATOR DO. OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK FOR EXACT I HAD A RECENTLY PASSED A LAW REQUIRING ALL THEIR. THROUGH THERE ONE CALL CENTERS. AND THEY'VE DONE TWENTY THE NEXT. SO FAR SO IT'S-VERY IMPRESSIVE WHAT THEY'RE AND IT'S VERY THOROUGH AS OPPOSED TO- POTENTIALLY A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON YOUR LICENSING TESTED THAT ARE UP FOR MIDDLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE RELATED TO BEING A- CONTRACTOR IS THE- FOCUSED ON SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU TAKE PROCESS. THAT COULD BE A TARGET WORK TOWARD- HOWEVER- I THINK THE DIXIE BORDERS MAKING GOOD PROGRESS BUT I THINK THERE ARE A FEW KEY WORDS IN STAFF THAT ARE GOING. TO MAKE IT IGNORE- FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE EXEMPTIONS THAT ALLOW- CERTAIN FOR THE OPERATORS OPERATIVES PATE. BASED ON WHAT THE UNDERGROUND. OR WHO THEY ARE IF THAT CLOUT IN THE- IN THE POLITICAL ARENA THEY'RE ABLE TO SAY WE DON'T NEED TO SPEAK. AND SPELL OUT. SO KEEPS WERE EXCAVATED DON'T HAVE TO GET BEFORE THEY DIG MOST NOTABLY MARIANNA BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE ALL CONTRACTORS WORKING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. THE OLD. AMBER SITUATIONS THERE THAT OTHER STATES HAVE SOLVED THROUGH- LEGISLATIVELY. ENFORCEMENT BEING FRACTURED PEOPLE AGENCIES THAT'S NOT A COMMON IN OTHER STATES. MANY STE AGENCY IT DOESN'T ALL WORK HERE WERE AMONG FOR AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE FOR AS BEEN. OPTIMAL OVER THE YEARS I WOULD SUSPECT IN JUST NOW ORDERED AND SO IF WE WANT TO CATCH UP QUICKLY THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. IMAGES BRING UP ABOUT THAT ALREADY I AM CRITICAL OF THE DIG SAFE WORDS- RECOMMENDATION OF REPORTING DAMAGES BECAUSE EVEN STEP INTO ONLY REQUIRE REPORTING OF WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL HIGH PRIORITY DAMAGES IF THAT WAS YOUR INJURY OR IT WAS A GAS OR SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT THAT WILL BE HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MANY DIFFERENCES ARE OCCURRING OF WE DON'T REQUIRE ALL FACILITY TYPES TO BE REPORT. HE SAW THE PROBLEM OF. THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM FIRST AND I IT'S NOT GOOD POLICY TO SAY WELL WE'LL JUST FOCUS ON THE LIGHT TO FIND OUT. EVERYTHING ELSE LATER I THINK WE OUGHT AT LEAST GET DATA FOR EVERYTHING ELSE RUN BEGINNING AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE TO EDUCATE ACCORDINGLY BUT I THINK WE NEED A FIRST OF ALL I RECOMMEND THAT WE REQUIRE ALL FACILITY DAMAGES. REPORT. MAY RECALL FOR THE FIBER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. WHO IS GOING TO SAY THE OTHER DAY BUT IN MY MIND THAT COULD BE WITHIN THE LAST YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN YOURSELF WHETHER OR THE HEAD THE TOOK OUT A BUNCH OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES HERE. WE HAVE A BUNCH OF CALLS TO OUR OFFICE FROM. THE THING WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS FIBER HIT WELL. THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE RIGHT NOBODY WAS HURT BUT STATE GOVERNMENT WAS DOWN. TIME AND UNDER CURRENT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE- TAES A BOARD THAT WOULD NOT EVEN BE REPORTABLE. SO NEVER MIND INVESTIGATING NOT EVEN REPORTABLE. COMMAND COMMUNICATIONS AND ALL THE OTHER FOR. AND THERE. IF YOU COULD HOLD FOR ONE SECOND IS ELEVEN OO EIGHT. I'VE. NEIGHBORS IN. PLEASE JOIN ME RIGHT ON FROM. ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT. A LOT MEANT VERY FORMER HAVING TAKEN THAT'S WHEN I CAN WRITE I JUST WANTED TO THING I WANT TO SAY IS THAT I CAN- ABOUT FUNDING MECHANISM RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THAT THE UTILITY OPERATORS. ARE PAYING FOR EVERYTHING RIGHT THEY PAY TO FUND. THE ONE CALL. BURKE THEIR FACILITY. THAT'S AT NO COST TO THE EXCAVATOR. UNDER THE BIG SAFE WORK SO FAR NO- FUNDING IS AS FAR AS I KNOW FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE HAS COME TO SUPPORT THE THICK BOARD. OF THE TOP OF. FACILITY OPERATORS MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT I'M SURE THEIR OFFICES BOARDED. WITH A LONG THOSE LINES BUT SO IS MY OFFICE WE'VE ALSO BEEN DIRECT TO DO THE BILLING FOR THE DICK'S EXPORT. SO THAT'S THE ONE CONCERN THERE AND WHAT I ATE WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW AS WE TALK ABOUT FUNDING- OR THEY NEED MORE DATA. CATION SOME OF THAT IS BURDEN IS GOING TO COME BACK TO THE ONE CALL CENTERS FOR EXAMPLE THE CONTRACTORS THANKS IS NOW. AFTER. BUT AFTER A YEAR THEY ARE NOW IN TO ASK FOR DATA RELATED TO TICKETS SO THAT THEY CAN INVESTIGATE DAMAGES AND WE GAVE THEM ACCESS TO OUR- BASS AND THEY. DATE A INSTEAD ONE US SEARCH FOR AND SO OW WE HAVE MEMBERS COMPLAINING O ARE YOU TELL THE OPERATORS COMPLAINING THAT NOW THEY HAVE TO ALSO FUND. AIDING THE STATE ACTIVITIES AND SO THAT'LL GIVE. YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT OR MAYBE A SUGGESTION OF HOW WE COULD DO IT BETTER AND. WHAT WELL WE COULD DO A AND A FEW THINGS WE COULD- WOULD WE COULD HAVE SOME OF OUR STAFF. OF DEDICATED. FOR IT WOULD BE A LOT BUT WE COULD HELP. PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES TO ANY STATE AGENCY THAT WANTS OF WHETHER IT'S P. C. P. C. OR DICK'S A BOARD OR- THE FAR MARSHALL- IF. SOME FUNDING FROM THE STATE TO HELP WITH THAT. IT MORE OF AN OVERALL CAUGHT YOU YOU WERE SAYING THAT. ALL OF THE COST NOW GOES TO THE UTILITIES RIGHT. THANK THE NOT TYPICALLY. REGULATIONS BOARD REQUEST. I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT. BUT ARE THERE OTHER. OPPORTUNITIES FOR BEING THAT TO. TO REDUCE PAIN THAT YOU'RE YOU WERE MENTIONING OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT ALREADY QUESTIONS IF WE COMING FROM THEM DO YOU HAVE A AN ALTERNATIVE FOR IN. MECHANISM I'M. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH RELATED TO THAT FACILITY OPERATORS AT MEMBERS OF OURS. IS ROUGHLY OTHER BETWEEN THE TWO. WE'VE GOT OVER TWO THOUSAND FACILITY OPERATORS IN THE STATE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE. THAT'S A- AN ISSUE THERE TO THE IN MY IN THE STOMACH ENFORCEMENT. OKAY. BUT IF I DO YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE GREAT GOOD ALSO I APPRECIATE WHEN HE ARE ACTIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR. IN THE. I WILL REPEAT THE TO LOUISE ENGINEER DIG SAFE PORTAL AS ON SAFETY AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH STRESS HELEN AFTER WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SPEAK HERE TODAY IN. PRESENT. A REMINDER THAT YOU SEE VIEWS WORK ALONG WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO THE EXCAVATION COMMUNITY TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE IMPROVEMENTS ARE STILL RELATIONS ENFORCEMENT COULD RESULT IN ABSOLUTE REDUCTIONS IN DAMAGES OF. IN AN ACCOMPANYING INCREASES TO ACCOMPANY KINGS. PLEASE IN THE SAFE FOR THE EXCAVATING COMMITTEE ON THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. WE CONTINUE THEIR PARTICIPATION WE PARTICIPATE WITH THE CURRENT FORM A COMMON GROUND. HELLO. GROUND ALLIANCE THIS IS THE NATIONAL SO WE HAVE WE DONE. GOOD LUCK COMMITTEE OF THAT IS ALL FOR BEST PRACTICES SO WE PROTECT PAID AT THE STATE LEVEL. YOU WITH BOTH ONE CALL CENTERS. IT IN ME. TIONS FOR RATIONS. AND PIPELINE IF IT IS MATERIAL SAFETY ADMINISTRATION FILMS A WHICH OVERSEES OUR PROGRAM. I IN THE GAUGING AND OF COURSE WE ATTEND. THE NEW BOARD- IN PROVIDING GUY AND IN TERMS OF THE PROCESSES AND ARE IN ASSISTING THE DEVELOPMENT I AM RELATIONS AS THEY PROCEED. MISSION HAS ITS OWN REGULATIONS IN ORDER ONE TWELVE F. ONE TWENTY EIGHT. THIRTY ONE AS WELL AS- GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION IN WHICH COULD BE ACT OF MARKING LOCATE ACTIVITIES AND- YOU TEACH THESE JURISDICTIONAL TO THE SI PC TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ONE CALL PROCESS. I CAN. THESE PER. BY APPROXIMATE LOCATIONS. DEVOID. A GROUP FUNDING IS ALSO A FACTOR BY THE STATE'S OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IMAGE PREVENTION PROGRAM THE CBC'S GAS SAFETY PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S PROGRAMS. ARE IMPACTED. STATE HAVING AN EFFECT. DAMAGE MISSION PROGRAM. AND AGAIN THERE'S- WE'VE SHARED THIS WITH A MAN I'M SURE THEY'RE GETTING TIRED OF HEARING IT FROM ME OUR FAMES AS DEFINED NINE ELEMENTS IN EFFECT. PROGRAM WICH THEY USED TO GAUGE. STATUS OF PROGRAMS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR EFFORTS OVER. IN WITHIN THOSE NINE ELEMENTS TO. YOU SEE IN THE MARKET WORK THE. OR VISIT BEING FOR A ONE CALL LAWS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO IN PARTICIPATION FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS EVERY. SAYS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FIVE. THE DISCUSSED EARLIER IN TERMS OF THOSE THAT DON'T BASICALLY BANKRUPT A FIRST TIME OFFENDER WHO DOESN'T DO YOUR IMAGE HAVING A PROCESS. HAVE. CHANGE THERE WILL REDUCE PROCEDURES AVOID THE- SOMETHING THAT RECORDING CAN YOU ASSESSMENT SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS GAUGING ITSELF LOOKING AT WHERE. AND ALSO I'LL LEAVE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE ENFORCEMENT. PAGE AND EVERYTHING THAT ONE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY DOES ARE THEY- RACKLEY APPLIED IN THE IN THE PROBLEM. AND OF COURSE ENFORCEMENT OVERALL BEING UNIFORM AND FAIR EVERYBODY SHOULD BE TREATED WELL. THE PROCESS AND IT SHOULD BE. AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET FROM EVERYBODY INVOLVED SO. THOSE ARE JUST FIVE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT AND THERE'S AND THERE'S MORE THE TERMS WHAT IT IS RIGHT GUIDANCE IN THE PROCESS OF THE BOOK. DEVELOPMENT AND KIND OF FOCUSING AND- MAKING SURE. MEETING THOSE SORTS CALIFORNIA. AGAIN BECAUSE IT IMPACTS OUR FUNDING AND ALSO TO. FILMS IT HAS THE ABILITY. IN INTO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS IF THEY FEEL THAT ARE. OUR ARMED FORCES IN ACTIONS ARE INSUFFICIENT SO TO AVOID THAT KIND OF INTERVENTION WE SHOULD BE MEETING ALL NINE I'LL- BE CLASSIFIED AS A STATE. OF DAMAGE PREVENTION PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW WOULD BE GINNY'S THE COMMISSION WORK. RELATED TO PEAK IN THE INDOOR CAN'T GET INTO A WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL ON IT IT IS STILL A PENDING INVEST. THE OUR. ENFORCE YOUR THINGS THAT UP. KNOWN AND WE NEED TO WORK ON IT. IS IN OUR PROCESS IS TO ADDRESS. IN ITS CITY ANYBODY ANY UTILITIES AND OPERATORS HAVING SIGNIFICANT TAKEN. NEED TO MAINTAIN CLOSE MEDICATIONS I'VE DONE INCIDENT THIS TO GET MYSELF YEARS YOU KNOW THAT. ALIVE CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION MAKING CERTAIN THAT EXCAVATORS THE DESCENT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WHAT ARE CONTENT INVOICE CONSENT REALLY A LOT OF INCIDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED DIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF POOR COMMUNICATION SO YOU KNOW MUNICH CATIONS IS CRITICAL. I IN ALL OF THE EVENTS. THE ITEM IS IN FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE. LARGE OPERATORS ANYBODY AS LARGE VOLUMES OF TICKETS. SOME PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THEIR OPERATIONS. IN THAT ALLOW. THEN IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCIES AND TAKE ACTION SO THAT'S NOT NEW THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS BEEN THE CASE BUT IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR LARGE OPERATORS TO CERTAINLY HAVE. VERY EFFECTIVE AND ROBUST AROUND THAT AREA. AND WE ARE INSPECTIONS OF WE DO. HAVE FOR OPERATORS A. PROGRAMS THERE THERE CERTAINLY ALL THIS FOR IMPROVEMENTS BUT- SO WE DO LOOK AT THOSE AS PART OF OUR INSPECTION I TO DETERMINE- WHAT THE UTILITY OFFERS AND FILTERS. AS PART OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND. AND THAT'S CRITICAL YOU CAN'T CATCH IT YOU SINGLE OUT. TO FIND THOSE ISSUES WHEN I CREATED AND- MARIETTA- INCIDENT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'VE INVESTIGATED THAT STILL OPEN- IN BUT EARLY INDICATIONS IT'S NOT A UTILITY OPERATIONS FOR PRACTICE OR ISSUE THIS IS CERTAINLY A CASE OF SOMEBODY HADN'T CALLED IN THE TICKET. AND WE KNOW THERE'S- PROCESS UNDER WAY TO YOU KNOW CHANGE THAT AND HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THE GROUNDING ISSUES AND- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST SOLAR COMPANIES THAT DO GROUNDING RODS AND SO IT IT A LOT OF ENTITIES MAYBE. MAY HAVE THAT AFTER ASPECTS OF IT IT REALLY BE SHOULD BE SOMETHING UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE- ANY ROUNDING CAN HAVE THAT SAME KIND OF IMPACT SO. ARE IT'S NOT A UTILITY ISSUE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A UTILITY VIOLATION ISSUE AT THIS STAGE BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT. WE NEED TO. GEN REINFORCE ALL EXCAVATORS TO CONTINUE CALLING IT ONE ONE AND BE AWARE WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE. AS FAR AS THE EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND THE OUTREACH PROGRAMS THE BOARD IS PUTTING TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH CARGO FOR MANY YEARS WE KNOW WE'VE YOU KNOW. THE CARD IS DEVELOPED A LOT OF PROGRAMS. THIS CERTAINLY HAVE VALUE THEY REALLY NEED TO BE CONSIDERED. ARE AND THE COMMISSION ITSELF DOES PUBLIC AWARENESS EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND SO WE DO OUR PART AND OF COURSE WE REQUIRE THE UTILITIES PROVIDE THE MESSAGES RELATED TO A ONE ONE AND THE ONE CALL. SO THAT'S OUT THERE BUT BUT AGAIN AS THE BOARD DEVELOPS ITS OUTREACH PROGRAM EDUCATION PROGRAMS WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT THAT AS- FOR OPPORTUNITY WHERE HOW. WE CAN ASSIST IN FOR THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MR SURELY APPRECIATE THAT AND I DID WANT TO. JUST HIGHLIGHT AND I KNOW THE SENSITIVITY AROUND THE ISSUE OF P. GENIES. FALSIFICATION OF. LOCATED MARC RECORDS IN THAT CASE ITS ONGOING END. I THINK WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE SETTLEMENT THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED BY THE TWO. BY THE- INTERESTED PARTIES- AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN LOOKING AT THAT. SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FIVE OF WHICH IS A PENALTY AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO THE WORK IF THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN REQUIRED TO DO AND PAY FOR. IS AN OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLE OF A REGULATOR NOT GETTING THE POINT OR MAKING THE POINT AND I KNOW HIS IS NOT AN ABOUT DIRECT UNITY USUAL PLEASE DON'T BUT I JUST HOPE THAT THERE IS JUSTICE WITHIN THAT IN THE PROPER MESSAGES SENT. OVER THAT ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE TODAY IS FRANKLY OUTRAGEOUS AND- AND NOT SOMETHING THAT I THINK ANY OF US COULD OR COULD BE A PROUD OF. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU YOU OPEN THE ISSUE A LITTLE BIT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DID WANT TO MEANT TO WELCOME BY SENATOR PAN FOR THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY CREATED VERY MUCH MISTER RIVERA I THINK YOU'RE NEXT ON THE LIST ALL RIGHT SOUNDS GOOD AND I APPRECIATE THAT DIRECTOR GAS SYSTEM INTEGRITY. PROGRAM SELFISH SO CAL GAS AND SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC AS WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE IMITATION- I'VE BEEN WITH UTILITIES FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW. AND IN MY CURRENT ROLE. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE TREATED SECRETIVE DIRECTION AND MANAGEMENT OF OUR SYSTEM INTEGRITY POLICY AND PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE ROB RELATED SAFETY AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES AS THEY RELATE TO PROGRAMS THAT HELP FOR PROMOTE DAMAGE PREVENTION OUR PUBLIC ONENESS EFFORTS OPERATE OPERATOR CONTROL AS WELL AS LEVERAGING OPERATIONS TECHNOLOGY. TO PROVIDE. MORE EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN PLACE PROCEDURES. AS MENTIONED EARLIER. JULY FIFTEEN OF THIS YEAR A TRAGEDY TOOK PLACE WITHIN OUR SO CAL FAMILY A CONTRACTOR DAMAGE ONE OF OUR RESIDENTIAL SERVICE LINES. RESULTING IN A HOME EXPLOSION FATALLY WOUNDING. ONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND INJURING SEVERAL OTHERS. WE CONTINUE TO MOURN THE LOSS OF WACO PATRICK AN EMPLOYEE WITH ELEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE. AND AGREE TO SOME OF THESE REMAIN WITH INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OF THOSE IMPACTED. THIS WAS ONE DAMAGE YOUR DATE WE'VE HAD TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DAMAGE OR TWO IF I HEARD OF DAMAGES ACROSS EVERY TERRITORY. ANNUALLY WE EXPERIENCE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND AND AGES ON A REGULAR BASIS. 60% OVER SECURITY DAMAGES WE NEVER RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE NOTIFICATIONS ARE A SAY A ONE ONE CALL. NO OPERATORS AND LOCATIONS SANDERS CARRY OUT BEARS AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO PROVIDE GREATER VISIBILITY ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CALLING EIGHT ONE ONE. YEAH EVEN EVEN WITH THESE CAMPAIGNS. EXCAVATORS LACK IN AWARENESS OF CALLING EIGHT ONE ONE. AND WE SEE THIS WHEN WE START INVESTIGATING SOME OF THESE IT DAMAGES. WALL EVEN SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE STILL TO THE CALL THE SERVICE BECAUSE- THEY SEE IS OF IN IT. BATES AVOID A CALLING BECAUSE THEY SEE IT MORE AS AS AN IMPEDIMENT AND THEY SEE NO NO TANGIBLE CONSEQUENCES. AND THAT LESS SOMETHING HAPPENS. AND WE ALL UNDERSTAND HERE THAT THERE NEED TO BE A CHANGE OF THIS COLORS LIVES THAT ARE BEING IMPACTED. AND THEN. WHEN WE DO HAVE ALL THE EXPERIENCE I DO CALL A ONE ONE. WE SEE A AND HIGHLIGHTED BY SOME OF THE OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING SAFE EXCAVATION PRACTICES. EVEN WHEN THEY DO CALL THIRD YOU'RE NOT A HEARING HIS EXPRESSION PRACTICES AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT EDUCATION AS TO WHAT THOSE ARE. NO I WILL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITIES WERE AS AN OPERATOR. WE FAIL TO DO OUR JOB CORRECTLY AND WERE HAVING A MISS MARK OF A OF A LINE. AND PART OF THAT YOU KNOW SINGLE MENTION THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE. EXTENSIVE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAMS TO MONITOR TO SEE WHAT WE CAN IMPROVE AND MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR NOT ONLY FOR EMPLOYEES. LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY GIVEN RIGHT TOOLS LEVERAGING OUR SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE AS ACCURATE MARKS. ON A REGULAR BASIS AD- MISTER JAMES HIGHLIGHTED IN WE RECEIVE. THIS YEAR WE RECEIVE ALL ROUGHLY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND TICKETS- TO RESPOND TO- LOOKING WORK SO A LOT OF TIMES WHERE THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENS. AND AS THINGS HAPPEN THE RIGHT THE WAY SHOULD BE HAPPENING. BUT WE BELIEVE IN SETTING THE SCENE WHICH IS A GOOD POSITIVE FOR US AND WE APPRECIATE. THAT NUMBER OF TICKETS. INCREASE OUR MISSILE AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE HAD A REALLY HISTORIC. MONTHS AND EVEN DAYS WERE YOU RECEIVE UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND TICKETS IN ONE DAY THAT WE'VE HAD TO RESPOND TO. SO WE'RE SEEING THAT. THE THINGS THAT ARE ARE BEING DONE THERE STARTED SLOWLY TAKE A FACT. AND ONE THING THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS IN ON IS COULD STILL GETTING A GREATER AWARENESS OF CALL ANYONE WANT. TO BE IN A GIVEN GIVEN OPERATE OPPORTUNITY TO GO OUT THERE AND LOOK AT THEIR FACILITIES. ALSO IF THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED THAT. WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH. THE BOARD- THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS NOTIFICATION CENTER IS. HOW DO WE EDUCATE ON EXTRA STATE EXCAVATION PRACTICES WE WANT TO FOR THE FORTHCOMING. ANOTHER KEY ELEMENT OF THIS IS REALLY STRENGTHENING WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHENING THE GOVERNMENT CODE FORTY TWO SIXTEEN WHICH IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON PROVIDING OUR- ADDED CLARITY WHETHER IT'S SOME OPPORTUNITIES AND THERE'S SOME GAPS. AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE DO LOOK FOR TO IN THE FUTURE IS THE GREATER ENFORCEMENT- AND GREATER ENFORCEMENT OF THIS- BECAUSE WE DO SEE. THERE IS EXCAVATORS THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT HOLD THEM BACK FROM CONTINUED IS CONTINUOUSLY HAVING TO DAMAGE UNLESS STATE YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY. AN INJURY OR SOMETHING. AND JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AGAIN. THANK YOU MISTER. IF YOU BORROW WELCOME. MORNING MR TERENCE STAFF IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO COME AND PRESENT TO YOU ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. TODAY I'M HERE REPRESENTING- UNITED CONTRACTORS WHICH FOR PURPOSES OF BACKGROUND REPRESENT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED CONTRACTORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH EMPHASIS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE UNION CONTRACTORS WHO HIRE- LABORS ANOTHER CONSTRUCTION TRADES- THERE THE EMPLOYERS- TO WORK ON THESE EXCAVATION JOBS AND I WANT TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I'M GONNA FOCUS ON AND WHAT HAPPENS. AFTER THE CALL AFTER THE EIGHT ONE ONE CALL BECAUSE REALLY FOR CONTRACTORS NOT TO CALL YOU WHEN ONE IS JUST AN UNACCEPTABLE PRACTICE AND IN ITS WITH THERE'S NO WAY FOR US TO PROTECT THEM YOU KNOW- STAND UP FROM IT AFTER THAT FACT- SO. YOU KNOW SAFETY IS FIRST PRIORITY ONE PUT A MAN IN THE WHOLE AND EXCAVATION SITES ARE COMPLEX PLACES TO BE- THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS DON'T WITH- FOCUSED ON OFF RECOGNIZED AS A LOT OF TRAFFIC THE CAN BE AROUND THE THIS SITE. THE HOLES CAN BE VERY DEEP IN REQUIRE SURE ARE MANDATORY SHORING THERE'S HEAVY EQUIPMENT IS ALWAYS AN OPERATION AROUND THE HOLES A LOT OF THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND IN FACT OUR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. DO IN FACT FOCUS ON EXCAVATION PRACTICES WITH IT WITHIN- WITHIN THE TRAINING THERE'S CAL OSHA REQUIREMENTS IN AND TRAINING SEGMENTS THAT OUR PRINCES GO THROUGH TO- SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON EXCAVATION SAFE PRACTICES- YOU KNOW. ONCE THE CALL IS MADE- THERE'S A LOT OF FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH TYPICALLY TO IN IN THE GROUND. WE'RE NOT JUST DEALING WITH ONE OR TWO- INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATORS WE HAVE MULTIPLE- AND I CAN BE MULTIPLE FACILITIES FROM A SINGLE- UTILITY OPERATOR AS WELL SO I EVEN IF WE HAVE CORRECT MARKINGS. THOUGH IT WHICH THOSE MARQUEES PROVIDE THE ITEM OUT FOR US GOING IN AND SOMETIMES THOSE MARKINGS CAN BE A I WON'T PICK ANY ONE FACILITY BUT I'LL SAY ONE MARKING IDENTIFYING ON AN ORANGE DELICATE TELECOM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- CAN WE FIND AS WE GO INTO. THE WHOLE REPRESENT LAYERED FACILITIES. WE FIND ONE BUT THEN THERE'S TWO OR THREE BELOW THAT IS YOU GO FURTHER AND- AND WHAT'S REALLY KEY HERE IN THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE WITH THIS. IS OUR EXPERIENCE CONTRACTORS- WHEN THEY SEE THIS TYPE OF THING THE THEY TAKE EXTRA PRUDENT STEPS TO LOOK AT MAN HOLES. THAT THAT ARE AROUND THE FACILITY ARE OTHER CONNECTIONS THAT EXIST FOR POLLS OR OR UTILITY BOXES THAT THAT EXISTS TO MAKE SURE THEY VERIFY. OUTSIDE OF THOSE MARKINGS THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH IN THE CORRECT PARAMETERS AND THERE AREN'T HIDDEN- FACILITIES BOTH. BELOW THE GROUND NOW YOU KNOW WITH THAT SAID- WE STILL HAVE A CHALLENGE WITH THE MARKINGS COMING AND INCOMPLETE- INCORRECT. OR JUST FLAT MISSING AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME IMPORTANT STEPS TAKEN NATIONAL LEGISLATURE WITH ELEVEN SIXTY SIX- WHICH REQUIRES WITH ELECTRON POSITIVE RESPONSE WHICH IN FACT IF WE'RE- RESPECTING FIVE MARKINGS WE'VE GOT THREE OR FOUR. A WE DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WE COUNTER BEFORE WE DON'T KNOW. THE UTILITY ACTUALLY HAS A FACILITY IN THE GROUND AND THEY HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY DO OR DON'T WE'RE JUST STANDING THERE KIND OF WAITING GOING- IS IT YOU KNOW WE'RE OVERDUE BUT DO WE GO AND HIT AND THAT'S- YOU KNOW NOT A SAFE. PRACTICE SO. I YOU KNOW THAT I WILL SAY. THIS SB SIX SIX ONE THE EXCAVATOR AN OPERATOR COMMUNITY HAD A VERY CONTENTIOUS RELATIONSHIP. ENDED BUILT OVER THAT BUILT UP OVER DECADES AND IN LARGE PART THAT RESULTED FROM JUST A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES. AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS EXCAVATORS ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR NORMAL BIT. OPERATION AND OF BUSINESS AND INCIDENCES ARE HAPPENING- BUT THE OPERATORS WAR RATHER THAN FINDING OUT THESE THE. THE GUY WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND THOSE INSTANCES WERE JUST AUTOMATICALLY INVOICING CONTRACTORS WERE TAKING THEM TO COURT TOO WE DIDN'T TAKE THE NUMBERS ATIONS AGAIN AND THEY WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN WITH NO REAL BASIS ULTIMATELY AND NO REAL MEASURE FOR WHY THE INVOICES WERE WHAT THEY WOULD BE AND SO I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES WITH A NUMBER OF OPERATORS. IN OUR ABILITY TO GET CORRECT AND CURRENT CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE FIELD REPRESENTATIVE REPRESENTS AN AREA IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM OR CRISIS HOW WE GET ALL OF THEM QUICKLY AND GET QUICK FAST RESPONSES AND THE LIKE SO THAT THAT HAS BEEN- TRULY- SOMETHING WE'VE NOTICED A GREAT CHANGE AND- OTHER OTHER CHALLENGES OF EXPERIENCE IN THE WHOLE ABANDONED LINES THERE IS A PROVISION OR THEY HAVE TO MARK ABANDON LINES NOW BUT WE FOUND THAT ONCE WE GET IN THERE AND FIND ONE. OFTENTIMES OF THE OP NONE OF THE OPERATORS WILL CLAIM THAT LINE AND THEN WE HAVE NO WAITED TO VERIFY IT THAT'S A LIVE LINE OR IF IT'S IN A BAND ACTUALLY IS OF AN ABANDONED LINE HOW TO PROCEED WITH THAT AND YOU END UP WITH WITH DELAYS AND DELAYS DELAYS AN EXCAVATION AND I DO THINK I FEEL I SHOULD GO INTO THE INTO DELAYS BECAUSE- THEY CAN BE CATASTROPHIC FOR SMALL EXCAVATORS AND SMALL CONTRACTORS- YOU COMMIT A GREAT DEAL OF EQUIPMENT TIME MANPOWER. IN WHEN YOU COME TO A JOB STE READY TO DIG IN AND GO IN AND YOU HAVE ALL THOSE RESOURCES ON THE LINE AND YOU HAVE TO STOP WITH PROJECT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE MONEY GOING OUT THE WINDOW IT IS TIME GOES BY AND THAT'S THE CAN BE EXTREMELY DAMAGING PUT SMALL CONTRACT OUT OF BUSINESS- SO THE AND ON TOP OF THAT THERE COULD BE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES A LOT OF THESE EXCAVATIONS ARE SHORT TIME LINES. AND OPINIONS HAS A PROJECT CAN RENT FROM THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS UP TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER DAY THAT THOSE PROJECTS GO OVER SO THAT CAN BE- AS EXTREME CHALLENGE AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO PUT AN EXCAVATOR IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY MAKE A BAD CHOICE. BASED ON THE SUBJECTED FINANCIAL IMPACT IT COULD HAVE OVER THE PRUDENT IN THEIR SAFETY PRACTICES IN THE WHOLE SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT TO- ANOTHER THING WE WERE ADDRESSING THIS YEAR WITH THE BOARD AND BEEN ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN IS THE. NINETEEN FOURTEEN A- DEALING WITH. DIFFICULT SOILS. THAT CAN ALSO. A SAFETY PROBLEM FOR OUR MEN IN THE WHOLE BECAUSE IF YOU GET TO A DEEP. DEEP FACILITY OR VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO YOU DEAL WITH AND YOU'RE HAVING HAND TOOL OR USE FOR. USE INTO- PROCEDURES THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE THEY CAN PUT A MAN AT RISK IN AND WE NOW HAVE OPTIONS OR WORKING THROUGH. IN OTHER MORE PROOF METHODS TO GET TO FACILITY SAFELY. BE ABLE ACCESS THEM INTO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. YOU KNOW EDUCATION IS THE CONTINUED IMPORTANCE AND IN WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS AN ASSOCIATION. IS TO RAISE AWARENESS THROUGH ARC FOR OUR CONTRACTORS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEW BOARD I SAY NEW BOARDS COUPLE USED A FEW YEARS OLD BUT IT'S STILL NEW TO OUR GUYS- THERE'S DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SOME. INITIALLY THEY LOOKED AT SKIP SKEPTICALLY BUT NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT THIS CAN BE A RESOURCE FOR THEM. YOU CAN BE ACTUALLY PLACE WHEN THEY COME TO WORK THROUGH DIFFERENCES WITH OPERATORS IN THE CAN BE A NEUTRAL GROUND WHERE WE CAN MEDIATE THROUGH THOSE THOSE DIFFERENCES AND PROBLEMS AND COME TO SOLUTIONS SO.  PARTNERSHIP BUT I CAN I CAN ATTEST TO WITH THE DE BOARD WAS SAYING EARLIER ABOUT THE- CHALLENGE THEY'RE FACED WITH TRYING TO EDUCATE EVERYONE- WE FOUND CHALLENGES JUST GETTING THE WORD OUT TO ALL OF OUR GUYS. AND GETTING THEM TO ENGAGE AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE'S SUCH A- VAST. AB EVERYBODY CAN BE AS COMMUTER AT SOME POINT AND JUST GETTING THE WORD OUT THIS. IS CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SO. I IN GETTING YOU KNOW IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO THE OPERATORS TO IF WE EXPERIENCE YOU'LL FIND CASES WHERE WE COME ACROSS THERE'S THEIR FACILITIES. AND THERE ARE NEXT THAT ARE ALREADY THERE ARE THERE'S PATCHES OR SOMETHING SOME OF YOUR REPORT BEFORE. BEING ABLE TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION BE PARTNERS IN THE AND IN MAPPING THESE- FACILITIES IT MAY NOT BE SO YOU KNOW MAYBE OLDER OR NOT- WELL MAPPED- FOR IN THE PAST INSISTED THAT SUMMER Và. YOU KNOW DECADES OLD UP IN MANY DECADES OLD- WITH THAT SAID THOUGH WE SHOULDN'T A COMMUTER SHOULD BE SEEN AS- IS LOCATORS- OR- I SHOULD SAY. USES LOCATORS BECAUSE WE HAVE WE DO SEE INSTANCES WHERE LOCATED MARK WILL COME OUT AND- DESIGNATE IN YEARS MARKET A LARGE AREA WITH QUESTION MARKS AND SAY DELIGHT. IN IN THE SENSE OF THEIR STARTING THAT THE EXCAVATOR. NEEDS TO DAYLIGHT ALL FACILITIES. ARE IN THAT THAT ROUND. REGARDLESS OF IF THAT'S IN CONFLICT. WITH THEIR THEIR ACTUAL EXCAVATION IN THAT'S ABUSE OF THAT. THAT POWER IN A IN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE- NEED TO WORK THROUGH BUT IN IN THE WAYS THAT WE CAN GET THE- THE- AS DRAW LINES- PLANS CORRECED WHERE THEY WERE BUILT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND WE SEE VARIANCES THAT COME INTO PLAY AND- HAVE SAFELY BEEN DISCOVERED AND- THAT'S WHERE WE ARE KEY PARTNERS IN THIS. BUT AS I MENTIONED IS A STAR THIS EXAMINERS COME IN ALL SHAPES SIZES AND PURPOSES. FOR MOST PART WE ARE THE LARGE MORE SOPHISTICATED OPERATIONS BUT WE ARE ALSO THE ONES WERE IN THE HOLES- THE EXPERIENCING THE MOST CHALLENGES WITH. WITH THE MOST FACILITIES AT ANY GIVEN TIME SO. I APPRECIATE THAT- THE OPPORTUNITY COME HERE TODAY AND AN OPEN ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU IF YOU ARE A AND I DO HAVE ONE. THAT THE- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WOULD. CENTERS FRESH IN MY MIND AND AFTER- YOUR PRESENTATION. IN THIS CASE. IS SOMETHING WAS REFLECTED IN THE- THE- COMMITTEE HEARING. SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING WE HAD AN BAKERSFIELD AND A LOT OF THE. A LOT OF INFORMATION CAME TO LIGHT SOME OF THE ISSUES SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE CHALLENGES BETWEEN THE CONTRACTOR AND THE OPERATOR THE UTILITIES. AND THEN AFTER THAT- I. IN THE CITY OF SAN BRUNO THEY'RE DOING A GREAT SEPARATION ON THAT CALTRAIN LINE AND- THERE WAS A DAY AGAIN- THE- EVACUATED- NO ONE WAS INJURED. THERE WAS NO. EXPLOSION OR FIRE- THEN- P. JEANNIE CAME OUT THERE THE PROVIDER AT THAT AT THAT LOCATION. AND AS THEY WERE STANDING THERE THE PEOPLE FROM- THE CALTRAIN THE EMPLOYEES WERE STANDING OVER THE SITE AND THERE WAS A- DEPUTY SHERIFF THAT IN THERE AND- THE P. JEANNIE FELLOW. WAS THERE ANY TAKES HIS BREAK CANNOT STARTS BRAIN IN THE WHOLE. BASICALLY TO ME IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS COVERED IN WHATEVER WAS GOING ON AND WAS MAYBE MIS MARKED AND% TRYING TO CORRECT THAT THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN THE HEARING THAT WE HAD A BAKERSFIELD ONE TO THE OTHER ISSUE WAS THE MISS MARKING OF THIS FROM SOME OF THE UTILITIES AND- SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS DO YOU STILL FIND THAT AS A PROBLEM AND HOW EXTENSIVE IS IT- AND HAS THAT- SUBSIDED IN ANY ANYWAY SINCE- THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST POINT WHERE IF SOMEBODY FOLLOWING UP WITH KIND OF AFTER THE FACT YEAH MARKINGS THAT IS SOMETHING WE ENCOUNTERED REPEATEDLY EVEN A ROUTE BEFORE AND AFTER THAT THAT INCIDENT AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN KIND OF A- I WAS A COMMON PRACTICE BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY SEEM BAD LUMBAR MEMBER CONTRACTORS WE HAVEN'T SEEN SO MUCH OF THAT AS OF LATE SO I THINK THAT'S SOMEWHAT RESOLVED ITSELF IN IN- AS TIME'S GONE BY AND ENJOY AWARENESS TO THIS ISSUE IS TAKING PLACE. AS FAR AS MISS MARKS ARE CONCERNED IT'S STILL HAPPENING- NO MARKS MISS MARKS ALL OF THAT IT'S THERE IS A LOT OF VOLUME IN THE MARKS- THAT THE TO THE OPERATORS HAVE TO MAKE- AND I KNOW THAT THE SOME OF THE DRAWINGS ARE OLDER BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE THERE BLATANT MISS MARKS AND WE'RE GOING IN AND REFINING FACILITIES WEREN'T EVEN NOTATED THAT WERE IN THE GROUND AND IT'S COMING DOWN AND TO DO PRUDENCE ON THE EXTERIORS PART TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO JUST. YOU KNOW GO IN AND POSSIBLY STRIKE THE UNKNOWN AS WELL SO- YES IT'S STILL HAPPENING- AGAIN- IT'S IT COMES DOWN TO US WORKING AS PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE WE COMPLETE THOSE RECORDS TO THE BEST WE CAN. UPDATE ALL RECORDS BUT ALSO YOU KNOW. RECOGNIZING THAT THE OPERATORS HAVE TO BE GOOD PARTNERS IN GETTING THOSE TYPE MARKINGS TIMELY INCORRECT OR WE CAN MISTAKES HAPPEN IN ALL CASES. BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THEY JUST NOT BEING CAREFUL OR WE ARE SEEING- COMPANIES WERE AYE HIRING THIRD PARTY- LOCATORS. THAT AREN'T. I WILL SAY SUFFICIENTLY TRAINED TO RECOGNIZE FACILITIES AND IN SOME INSTANCES RESULT IN ERRORS AND MARKINGS IN THAT CASE AS WELL. THANK YOU- THE YES JOIN DATE. COULD RAISE ADEQUATE NO TO THAT- AT THE AT THE CALL% CENTERS WE EXPERIENCE COMPLAINTS ABOUT MISS MARKS AND NO MARKS LATE MARK'S DAILY MANY TIMES DAILY. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS BEEN ON MY RADAR FOR AWHILE AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO PUT THIS IN IS THAT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS IS A LIMITATION IN TECHNOLOGY THE ACTUAL INSTRUMENTS TO PHYSICALLY DETECT WHERE THE FACILITIES ARE THERE THERE IS. IMPROVEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE MADE IN THAT INDUSTRY BUT YOU KNOW THE FACILITY OPERATORS THEY CAN'T HELP OUT UNTIL SOME INVENTOR COMES UP WITH THE NEXT BIG THING TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THAT HOWEVER. THE RECORD KEEPING THAT MUST FAR AHEAD ON IS KEY AND- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A BEST PRACTICE WHERE. ALL NEW ALL FACILITIES WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED. TO DAYLIGHT OUR GPS MEANING ALL NEW INSTALLATIONS GET A RECORD BY GPS REPLACEMENTS RELOCATIONS REPAIRS EVERYTHING GETS DPS BEFORE IT GETS BURIED THAT DOES NOT OCCUR NOW NOT BY A LONG SHOT NOT EVEN NEW INSTALLATIONS BRAND NEW STUFF IS BEING GPS. SOME FACILITY OPERATORS WILL DO IT GOOD ONES BUT OTHERS WILL NOT DO IT UNLESS THEY'RE REQUIRED IS INCLUDE MUNICIPALITIES GAS COMPANIES TELECOM EVERY SECTOR. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO. MAKE PROGRESS BEAT WITH ALL THESE LINES ARE BEING DISCOVERED- BY EXCAVATORS ARE WE JUST GONNA BE CONTENT TO LET THAT BE THE CASE THAT SOME OF THE OVER THERE AND WE KNOW IT'S THERE BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE AND WE'RE JUST GONNA EXCEPT THAT FOREVER. THEN WE KEEP GOING AS BUSINESS AS USUAL BUT IF WE WANT TO HAVE THIS BE SOLVED IN TIME IS STILL GONNA TAKE DECADES. BUT THE WE'VE GOT TO GET STARTED AND THAT'S THE EASIEST UP IS START WITH THE NEW INSTALLATIONS AND THEN THE REPAIR OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DIG EVERYTHING UP JUST THE MAP IT BUT AS IT DOES GET DUG UP FOR OTHER PURPOSES REPAIR REPLACE IT RELOCATE THAT'S WHEN THE GPS IN OVERTIME. WE WILL HAVE GOOD RECORDS SO THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR THAT. Và RIVERA WE JUST WANTED OFFER OUR CONDOLENCES AND HOW SORRY WE ARE FOR YOUR LOSS AND THE MYRIAD EXPLOSION AND HOW YOUR FAMILY'S AND OF STRUGGLING AND SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OFFER THAT. HAVE FOR. YOU WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED FROM THAT EXPLOSION I MEAN DID WE LEARN IN AND WHAT. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO OR SHOULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY TO PREVENT THOSE IN THE FUTURE. WELL A ELECTION YOU MENTION- SALE MENTIONED EARLIER THE MEDIC MEDICATION STILL PENDING- BUT SOME OF A QUICK THING THAT WE DID. I AM LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR PUBLIC WORDS CAMPAIGNS IT GOES OUT TO SPECIFIC EXCAVATORS. THAT WE HAVE SO. FROM THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE. AWARENESS WE REALIZE THAT WE WEREN'T TOUCHING A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF EXCAVATORS WHO TRY TO LOOK AT EXPANDING. A COMMUNICATION THAT GOES OUT- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. MARGIE'S FROM THE DEPARTMENT CHEN IS LIKE. HOW WHICH BOOK IS OUR MESSAGING TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXCAVATORS I'M COOLEY NORMALLY HISTORICALLY WE HAVE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TARGET A SPECIFIC AUDIENCE. WE REALIZE THAT WE TARGET MULTIPLE AUDIENCES GOOD MULTIPLE PEOPLE CAN BE EXCAVATORS WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE. OF HAVING TO CALL YOU ONE ONE OR THIS IS A FREE SERVICE FOR THEM IT ACTUALLY CALL. AND LOOKING AT BILLY THE LEGISLATION TO SEE WHERE WE'RE- WORKING WITH DRINKING THING TO KIND OF MAKE MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. NO ONE AREA THAT WE SAW. WITH THE GOVERNMENT CODE FORTY TWO SIXTEEN IS THE DEFINITION OF EXCAVATION SOME PEOPLE HAVE. THE REDEFINITION AND EXPLICITLY THINK THAT'S WHAT IS IT IF I'M NOT DOING THIS NOT EXCAVATING BUT IT'S REALLY. CAN FULLY UNDERSTAND THE TIME I'M I'M REALLY MOVING SOIL. THAT BECOMES AN EXCAVATION OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THAT WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT AS WELL. THE BILL STOLE SOME OF. THINGS THAT WE STARTED LEARNING NOW AND IT WILL BE EXPANDING THAT AWARENESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAUDHRY AND I'M AN ASPEN TOMORROW USE THAT AS WELL AND IS THERE ANY. THINGS THAT WE'VE TAKE AWAYS FROM THAT THAT- WE CAN USE AS YOUR BEST PRACTICES OR WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO EDUCATE OR SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE. I THINK UP PARTICIPATING WITH CARMEN AND- IT CONTINUES TO BE THIS BIG AREA ABOUT. ARE YOU KNOW WHETHER NOT PERMITS REQUIRED FOR THE WORK AND WHAT AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT THEN GO TO ONE A ONE ONE REQUIREMENT. HOW TO CALL. SO I THINK JUST. PERHAPS A LOT MORE CLARITY ON THAT END. IN TERMS OF THE PERMIT AND THE TYPE OF WORK BEING DONE- THAT THEN MOVES TO THE PHASE OF. YOUR DIGGING SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UNDERNEATH. AND YOU NEED TO PULL A TICKET SO I THINK IT'S JUST A- IT IT IT STILL. TENDS TO BE AN AREA THAT THAT'S RIGHT BEFORE- BEFORE WE A LOT MORE CLARITY IN A LOT MORE. GUIDANCE TO FOLKS AND I THINK OUR GUYS. KIND OF TAKING IT ON AS AN ITEM I THINK IT'S AND ONE OF THE GROUPS LIKE I'M ON SO MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS I GET CONFUSED BUT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT INTENT. WHAT COULD WE DO TO PROVIDE MORE CLARITY OR OR SOME SORT OF AN EASY. A PLACE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND OTHERS TO GO TO DON'T KIND OF IDENTIFY OKAY I'M PLANNING A PLAN I DON'T NEED TO DO. I TAKE IT. BUT IF I'M PULLING A PERMIT THAT CERTAINLY MAKES IT A TICKET REQUIREMENTS- IN IN SO JUST. YOUNG WE COULD CERTAINLY WORK ON CLARIFYING THAT IN MAKING THAT A LOT MORE KNOWN TO EVERYBODY INVOLVED. THANK YOU AND IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE DEBATING THAT LEGISLATION ORIGINAL SIX SIX ONE LEGISLATION THIS. CAME UP TO QUITE SOME EXTENT AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO ADDRESS IT ULTIMATELY. IN THE END RESERVE BECAME TO HOMEOWNERS IN SOME INSTANCES LIKE THAT AND- TALK ABOUT YEAR TALK ABOUT DRIVING A STAKE INTO THE GROUND AND- THAT CAN BE SIMILAR TO. A REAL ESTATE SIGN OR EAT ANYTHING THAT'S COMMONLY MAYBE NOT PROCEED AS AN EXCAVATION BUT YOU'RE GOING IN THERE ARE GROUND AND BECAUSE SUBJECT- EQUIPMENT TO DAMAGE SO- THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT REMAINS. AROUND THIS THIS SUBJECT I THINK THAT THE GOOD. S. PRACTICES WOULD BE WARRANTED AT SOME POINT BUT I DO THINK THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK AS- WHEN WE COME TO THE REGARDING THE SUBJECT SPECIFICALLY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. MR ROBERT P. JEANNIE HAS A ROBUST QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM IN PLACE. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IN IT IT DISCOVERED. THE LOCATE AND MARK ISSUES MANY YEARS BEFORE THE CPC BROUGHT ITS CASE AGAINST THEM. OF A FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE ARE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM WAS IGNORED. AND NOTHING HAPPENED WITH THAT IT HOW IS THIS THE GENIE N SO CAL GAS PROMOTING THE ISSUES RAISED BY THEIR A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. WHILE IN JAIL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW WE STRONGLY FEEL CONFIDENT IS THAT WE HAVE- A STRONG. A STRONG CULTURE THAT ALLOWS THE EMPLOYEE TO RAISE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS. REGARDING TO THE EXTENT SUCH AS YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE ON DOING SOMETHING AT THE AT THE HAVE THE EVERYONE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO STOP THE JOB. WHICH IS AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT GONNA -CEED SUPREMACY PERSPECTIVE UNTIL THEY GET THE SUPPORT OR OF KNOWLEDGE MEANT. THAT HE THEY CAN MOVE FORWARD IN A SAFE MANNER. WITH THAT. IT ALLOWS US TO REALLY VALUE IS REALLY OVER THE COMMUNICATION LINES ALL THE WAY FROM THAT FRONTLINE EMPLOY. ALL THE WAY TO OUR OUR EXECUTIVES AT THE TOP LEVEL. WHERE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND NO KNOWLEDGE OF EMPLOYEES TO IDENTIFY WHEN THEIR SPECIFIC ISSUES AND THEN. AS PART OF OUR AS FAR QUALITY ASSURANCE WERE MONITORING AND LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE. YOU KNOW THOSE SENTENCES WERE WERE AT FAULT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHERE IS IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN DO WHETHER IT'S TRAINING FOR THAT EMPLOYEE TO GIVEN. THE RIGHT TRAINING THAT THEY HAVE THAT WHAT THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO TO DO. LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES HAVE FOR TOOLS COOLEY IS ALSO A BIG ONE- TO MAKING IT HAPPEN TO A RECORD KEEPING TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT RIGHT CORRECT RECORDKEEPING PROCESSES IN PLACE. TO ALSO LOOKING FOR LOOKING WHAT CAN WE DO TO PREVENT DAMAGES. YOU KNOW ONE THING THAT WE STARTED DOING FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS IS INSTALLING. ARE WE GONNA SELLING HIS WIRE MESH THE GOAL THE CROSSOVER HIGH PRIORITY LINES I'M IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT IT SERVES AS A DETERRENT. WHEN AN EXCAVATOR. ARM EXPOSES THE DISPLAY CAN ACTUALLY BACK WHOLE GET CAUGHT ON BECAUSE AS MUCH ROBUST DEVICE. I'M SO WE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THAT AND WE'VE NOW EXPORTS SPENDING THAT TO ALL OUR LINES. ON STARTING NEXT YEAR WILL BE UTILIZING THAT WIRE MESH WITH SO WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS. TO LEVERAGE. AND PROMOTE DAMAGES WERE FACILITIES. PHONE IN THE ONLINE PORTAL YOU'VE REMOVED THE ABILITY TO ADD COMMENTS TO TICKET SUBMISSIONS. WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE OR THINKING BEHIND THAT. SO THERE THERE ARE TWO FLAVORS TO CREATING TICKETS ONLINE. FIRST FIRST OF ALL WE PREFER TO CREATE THE TICKET ONLINE BECAUSE AS AWARENESS INCREASES IN VOLUME INCREASES. WE DON'T WANT A LINEAR- CORRELATION TO THE NUMBER OF CALL CENTER AGENTS THAT WE HAVE TO HIRE AS THE VOLUME GOES UP WE DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE OUR STAFF TO GO THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE UTILITY OWNERS FUND US AND THEREFORE THERE BILLS GO UP AND THEN BUILD SMALL MEMBERS COMPLAIN AND DON'T PARTICIPATE AND SO. WE TRY TO BE EFFICIENT BY DOING IT ONLINE THAT BEING SAID THERE ARE TWO FLAVORS ONE IS THE ONE IT'S FOR A SINGLE ADDRESS. SUCH AS A HOMEOWNER WORKING IN THEIR OWN YARD AND THAT ONE DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY TRAINING WE TRY TO HAVEIT BE- SELECT FROM THE DROP DOWN LIST YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTY ARE YOU WORKING IN WHAT CITY WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS WHAT PART OF THE PROPERTY DO YOU WANT CHECK FOR UTILITIES AND THAT'S IT. IT'S JUST BASIC THEN FOR EXCAVATORS OF OTHER TYPES ANY OTHER THING THAT'S MORE COMPLICATED AND SOME OF THEM GET EXTREMELY COMPLICATED WE ACTUALLY GIVE THEM THE SAME SOFTWARE THAT OUR CALL CENTRE AGENTS USE AND TEACH THEM HOW TO USE IT. BUT IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND SO YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE THAT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC WITH NO TRAINING TO DO THAT SO WE FOUND THAT- PROFESSIONAL EXCAVATORS WERE- SNEAKING AROUND THE- DROPDOWN LIMITATIONS. BECAUSE WHAT WE WOULD HAVE A PLACE WAS- YOU KNOW YOU'RE SINGLE ADDRESS ONE TWO THREE MAIN STREET AND THEN FOR WHAT PART OF THE PROPERTY DE WANT MARKED ENTIRE LOT FRONT REAR NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST. AND THEN WE HAVE ONE THAT WAS OTHER AND THEN IN OTHER WE ENVISION THAT THEY WOULD SAY ALL I ONLY WANT A TEN FOOT RADIUS AROUND THE MAILBOX BECAUSE I'M ONLY REPLACE THE MAILBOX AT ONLY MY WHOLE YARD MARKED I ONLY WANT THE MAILBOX. BUT WHAT WE WERE FIGHTING WITH THE CONTRACTORS WERE GOING IN OTHER AND THEN THEY WOULD TYPE OUT THIS LONG EXPLANATION ABOUT STARTED THIS ADDRESS AND CONTINUE FOR THREE BLOCKS DOWN THE STREET AND THEN TURN RIGHT AND SO ON MEANWHILE THE SYSTEM IS ONLY MAPPED IT OUT THE ONE ADDRESS AND NOTIFIED THE UTILITY OWNERS AT THAT ADDRESS. LEAVING OFF EVERYTHING ELSE. THAT THEY PUT IN THE TEXT SO WE TOOK AWAY THE ABILITY TO PUT IN FREE TEXT IN THE FLAVOR. THAT IS FOR HOMEOWNERS ALL THAT'S FOR THE SINGLE ADDRESS WITH NO TRAINING. THAT THE ROBUST ONE THAT'S DESIGNED FOR HIGH VOLUME EXCAVATORS THAT HAVE TO WATCH A VIDEO AND- CONFIRM THAT THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED THEY STILL HAVE FREE ACCESS TO DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. HE SAID. THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION. THE. HEY CPUC M. AND AS YOU KNOW I ASKED THE PREVIOUS PANEL ABOUT THE PARTNER AGENCIES IN THE SUPPORTING THE- THEIR EDUCATION IN LIEU OF FINE- STANDS AS THE CPUC CONTEMPLATED THAT APPROACH AND HOW WOULD IT FIT INTO THEIR ENFORCEMENT. STRUCTURE I THINK AGAIN AS FAR AS CONTEMPLATING THAT'S AS I ALLUDED EARLIER IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS SO THE NINE ELEMENTS HAVING THAT IS A PROCESS. OF IT FOR OFFENDERS SO WITH WITH THE UTILITIES WE DON'T REGULATE THE CONTRACTORS AND IN THE EXCAVATORS OTHER THAN THE NON OTHER THAN THE UTILITY FOLKS INVOLVED BUT- AGAIN FROM OUR PROCESS IT'S LOOKING AT THE DAMAGES FROM THE UTILITY AND- IS IT A RETRAINING ISSUE IS THE IS THAT A- WHAT WAS DID THE- INCIDENT- DAMAGE OCCUR AS A RESULT OF. A SIGNAL TRANSFER TO SOMETHING ELSE SO IS IT SOMETHING I WAS AVOIDABLE OR IS IT SOMETHING THAT THE PERSON IS COMPLETELY DIDN'T FOLLOW PROCEDURE SO. I THINK FROM OUR END IN TERMS OF THE APPLICATION OF THE EMPLOYEES ON THE LOCATORS INVOLVED FOR THE OPERATORS IT'S A MATTER OF HOW ARE THEY BEING TRAINED WHAT'S A RETRAINING- AND THAT'S REALLY OUR EDUCATION KUMAR THE REST OF IT THAT THAT DIFFERS BACK TO CONTRACTORS AND OTHER FOLKS. WE WOULD WE WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROCESS OF HAVING AN EDUCATION HAVING THAT IS A IN LIEU OF A OF A HEAVY FINE. AND HAVING SOME SORT OF AN ESCALATION IN FINES FOR THE PARTY INVOLVED. SO IF THEY DON'T CHANGE ADDED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE REPEAT OFFENSES SO THAT'S THE WAY WE LOOKED AT IT THAT'S WHO WE CAN APPLY IT FOR IS THE UTILITIES OWN AND YOU KNOW STAFF PERFORMING THE ACTIVITIES. AND A AND YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THEIR PROCESSES FOR RETRAINING AND RECALL FIND WE HAVE AT LEAST FOR THE GAS EITHER STRICT REGULATIONS IN TERMS OF OPERATORS SEVEN BECAUSE OF FOLKS DOING ACTIVITIES THAT ARE QUALIFIED ON THOSE TASKS. AND SO WAS THIS INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIED DID THE YOU KNOW IS THERE AN AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THEN THAT INDIVIDUALS QUALIFICATION IS AN AREA FOR IMPROVING THE OVERALL QUALIFICATION FOR THE TASK SO YOU CAN LOOK AT A LOT OF PERSPECTIVES IN TERMS OF HOW TO HOW TO APPLY THAT. UP THAT'S THE EXTENT OF HOW WE CAN LOOK AT IT. IN TERMS OF. HOW CAN YOU IMPROVING OPERATORS PROCESSES. THANK YOU. I BELIEVE FOR THE REGISTRAR DAVID VOTE FROM THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IS HERE HOW ARE YOU DOING IF YOU COULD COME UP I JUST HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO THE SAME. WHO V. M. THE ISSUE OF HAS THE BOARD CONTEMPLATED THE BIG BOARD'S ENFORCEMENT STRUCTURE AND HOW HOW TODAY ARE YOU DEALING WITH OR HE HANDLING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DIG BOARD RELATED TO VIOLATIONS AND OTHER. WELL I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH DR TONY MORAN KNOWN AS STAFF IN PUTTING TOGETHER A PROCESSES FOR WE START RECEIVING REFERRALS FROM THEM I DON'T BELIEVE WE RECEIVED A REFERRALS TODAY. BUT WHAT WE WORKED OUT IS THAT THEY'LL MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT TYPE OF ACTION IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT VIOLATION OF THIS RULE VERY QUICKLY TOUCH ON THE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THE FIRST WOULD BE AN ADVISORY NOTICE US WE'RE CURRENTLY USING TODAY WE ARE RECEIVING COMPLAINTS FROM SOAK SO THE CALIFORNIA GAS AND OTHERS AND IF WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO BE MADE WHOLE MEETING THERE WAS A HAT AND THERE'S RESTITUTION OR THE DOW IS UP THE PAID THEM THE CONTRACTORS WILLING TO PAY THOSE DAMAGES AND ATTEND THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM. IN ADVISORY NOTICE NOTICE MAY BE APPROPRIATE BUT I THINK WILLIAM MORE LIKELY TO SEE FROM THE DECK SAVE BOARD IS A SITUATION WHERE THERE MAY BE DISCLOSURE REQUIRED ON THAT LICENSE WE HAVE WHAT'S KNOWN AS A LETTER OF ADMONISHMENT AND THUS THAT CITY- A LETTER THAT WE ISSUE FOR THE VIOLATION. BY IT WILL GENERALLY HAVE IN ORDER TO ATTEND TRAINING BY OUR PARTNERS LET GO THROUGH A TRAINING PROGRAM IT PROVIDES FOR ONE YEAR DISCLOSURE ON THE LICENSE. A SITUATION THOUGH WHERE THERE'S BEEN A STRIKE AND THERE'S BEEN DAMAGES THAT OCCUR AND THE CONTRACTOR DOESN'T WANT TO PAY DAMAGES TO THAT PUBLIC UTILITY- THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN ADMINISTRATIVE CITATION BECAUSE A CITATION HAS THE ABILITY TO INCLUDED ORDER OF CORRECTION TO PAY RESTITUTION TO SOMEONE A CITATION WOULD INCLUDE. A FIVE YEAR- DISCLOSURE ON THE LICENSE AND THEN FOR THE VERY SERIOUS MATTERS WERE YOU MAY HAVE A FATALITY OF A REPEAT OFFENDER BUT AGAIN WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE DIG SAY FOR TO SEE IF THIS WAS THE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE THAT COULD BE SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF THE LICENSE. WAS WAS SAY TODAY OUR FIRST THING IS EDUCATION- WERE VERY I THEY WERE VERY PROACTIVE IN INFORMATION IS ON OUR WEBSITE IN OUR CONSUMER GUIDES ON WHAT WE'RE DOING TO HELP OUT REGIONALLY CONSUMERS. BUT TO THE LICENSEES SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO CALL. THE MAJORITY OF THE ACTIONS WE TAKE OUR THE ADVISORY NOTICE WHICH IS NOT. THIS CLOSABLE BUT IT DOES ACHIEVE. WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE EDUCATION A COMPLIANCE COMPONENT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT THEIR CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD IS DOING. AND CONTINUES TO DO TO A- TO FACILITATE THIS ISSUE RELATED TO THE DIG SAFE BOARD IN THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ALSO THE GREAT WORK YOU DO ELSEWHERE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY YES MAY TWENTY. OF IT IN RELATION JUST BEFORE YOU SIT DOWN SIR- I KNOW MANY OTHER STATES REQUIRE CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDITS RELATED TO BEING A PROFESSIONAL EXCAVATOR. SUCH AS THAT IF YOU GET YOUR LICENSE ONE TIME- WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE. BUT THEN YOU CONTINUE TO DIG FOR A FORTY YEAR CAREER. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS ARE STAYING UP TO DATE ON- BEST PRACTICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT RELATED TO EXCAVATION. THEIR TALK AT CECIL B. ABOUT REQUIRING. AT LEAST FOR EXCAVATION RELATED CONTRACTING TO HAVE CONTINUING EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT THEY KNOW THE LAW CHANGES AND SO FORTH. WELL YEAH WHAT THEY DO WANT TO CONFIRM THAT WHILE I WAS. ATTENDING THIS MEETING I CONFIRM THAT OUR TRADE EXAM FOR NEW LICENSEES DOES INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT TO CALL A ONE LINE SO WE DID. WE DID VERIFY THAT WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING WEBINARS AND PODCASTS. WEBINARS AND TRAINING COURSES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CODE REQUIREMENTS SO THIS COULD BE PART OF THAT. IS FAR AS A MAN IT MANDATED CONTINUE EDUCATION TRAINING COMPONENT THE LAWS ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDE FOR THAT. BUT IN THE EVENT THAT WE FIND SOMEBODY'S WILEY Là OWSLEY WANT TO GET THE WORD OUT WE WANT TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DIG SAY POURED. IN IN OUR WITH OUR YOU TUBE CHANNEL WITH OUR OUR PODCASTS WEBINARS AND ARE. ON OUR MONTHLY MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE WITH APPLICANTS AND INDUSTRY STATEWIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. THE END. CHAUDHRY THE M. S. THE D. BOARD DURING THE LAST PANEL ABOUT THEIR MO YOU WITH THIS IF YOU SEE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE BOARD WAS INVOLVED IN THE P. JEANNIE LOCATE AND MARK PROCEEDINGS AND SAID INSIDE THE SPECIFIC CASE- DOES THE CPUC HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED IN P. GENIES. PROGRAM ARE NOT SYMPTOMATIC OF LARGER ISSUES IN THE DIG SAFE COMMUNITY. WE WILL CONTINUE WE LOOK AT THAT WERE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT IN TERMS OF OUR INSPECTIONS- AND INCIDENTS INVESTIGATIONS AND REVIEW OF THE DATA THAT WE GET. UP BY THE BY THE UTILITIES UP. A GAS AT THE INDUSTRY FOR THE REPORTING. AND. BASED ON THE INSPECTIONS BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SAYING THERE'S CERTAINLY AREAS AS IT'S BEEN NOTED BEFORE THERE'S MISS MARKS AND LATE TICKETS AND THINGS ARE OCCURRING I AND NUMBER AVOID WILL SUMMER NINE AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN LOOKING A CUBIC UC'S LOOKING AT THOSE. BUT AS FAR AS OVERALL ISSUES OF THAT TYPE THAT'S NOT BEEN A GAS INSPECTIONS A WE'VE DONE SO FAR. THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT IS AT ISSUE. YOU KNOW IT THE AGAIN THE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE QUEUE IF YOU SEE PROGRAMS. BUT AS FAR AS ISSUES YES THERE'S RIGHT AREAS THERE'S IT CERTAINLY IN AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF. GETTING ACCURACY GETTING TICKETS MARKED ON TIME AVOIDING DAMAGES BY THE UTILITIES OWN- EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES. BUT A OVERALL IT'S NOT A LARGE TRAINED- THAT THAT WE'RE OBSERVING OKAY. GOOD AND HOW HOW IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH IT TAKES A BOARD ON ME ARE YOU WORKING. THROUGH THAT MO USED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A- THE COMMUNICATION OF THE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU'RE REALLY AT THE HEART OF. THE ENFORCEMENT AND MOST OF THOSE PROBLEMS WILL WIND UP IN YOUR LAP AT SOME POINT IN TIME I WOULD THINK WE AGAIN WE'VE- YEAH WE'VE DONE INCIDENT DESTINATIONS OF DICKENS. FOR A LONG TIME THIS SO AS FAR AS THE ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT NHà. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A BIG BOARD- TO IDENTIFY HOW THE DATA IS GOING TO BE RECEIVED WHAT. ARE YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE ACCOMMODATE EACH OTHER'S NEEDS I MEAN OTHER THAN ESTABLISHING THE ANIMAL YOU WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY. RECENT MEETINGS OR DISCUSSIONS ON THAT END. BUT CERTAINLY IN IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN. RECEIVE THAT AND YOU KNOW. AT SOME POINT WE'VE GOT TO DECIDE HOW WE'RE GOING TO PROCESS THOSE AS WELL. BUT WE CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE THERE WOULD BE MORE BECAUSE IT. THERE ARE MORE HITS THAN TEN YEAH WE'RE WE'RE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE- AND IF SOME OF THOSE COME OUR WAY THAN THAT THAT WOULD BE SOME ADDITIONAL WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT AS YOU KNOW AS FAR AS ANY RECENT DISCUSSIONS ON THE ANIMAL YOU I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN ANYTHING MORE. THAN THEM ONCE WE ESTABLISHED. DR MARINA. AND MAYBE MAYBE I CAN JUST ADD- CERTAINLY THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS- BETWEEN OUR INVESTIGATORS. AND PC AND SEE NEIL BUT THERE'S ALSO BEEN SOME DISCUSSIONS- BETWEEN OUR ATTORNEYS. AND AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE PC IS A THE AGENCY WHERE YOU WANT TO. MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR LAWS BEFORE YOU JUMPING INTO THEIR SO THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS AT THAT ATTORNEY LEVELS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FOR THE TWENTY EIGHT. THE BIG BOARD DISCUSSED IN THEIR TESTIMONY THE NEED FOR MORE DATA. TO TRACK TRENDS INDIANS IN ORDER TO BETTER TAILOR THEIR EDUCATION PROGRAM TO SPECIFIC TASKS AS WE'VE SEEN. WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE NEED TO MANDATE A CALL. TO A ONE ONE IN THE EVENT OF A DEACON ESPECIALLY CLOSING THE LOOP ON A CALL BEFORE YOU DIG TO INCLUDE A CALL AFTER YOU TAKE. A OR DIG INTO SOMETHING- BOTH OF THESE TOPICS CENTER AND THE OPERATIONS AT THE ONE CALL CENTERS AND- A RELIANCE ON YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THAT TO MAKE IT WORK OR JUST. EAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE EARLIER THIS YEAR. REQUIRED REQUIRING ELECTRIC ELECTRONIC POSITIVE RESPONSE TO ONE CALL CENTERS AFTER LOCATING MARK. HOW DO YOU FORESEE THE ONE CALL CENTERS. ADJUSTING TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS. THE GREAT QUESTION FIRST THE I WANT TO SAY THAT WE ARE VERY PLEASED WELL I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MYSELF I'M CONFIDENT THAT- DEALER WOULD AGREE WITH ME BUT I WON'T PUT WORDS IN IN THEIR MOUTH- BUT USA NORTH IS VERY PLEASED WITH BOTH OF THESE- NEW DEVELOPMENTS- WE'D BE HAPPY TO RECEIVE. A RECALL- REPORTS OF DAMAGE OF EVERY TYPE BECUSE THEN WE HAVE THE DATA SO THEN WE CAN KNOW HOW TO TARGET OUR EDUCATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- NO OFFENSE TO THE DIG SAKE BOARD BUT THEY'RE STILL IN THEIR INFANCY IN SO RIGHT NOW THE- EDUCATION IS BEING DONE BY US- MEANING THE TO NOTIFICATION-CENTERS AN THEN YOU KNOW SOME- FACILITY OPERATORS DO THAT- VERY WELL ALSO AND HAVE ROBUST PROGRAM SUCH A SO CAL GAS AND P. JEANNIE AND OTHERS BUT THEN THERE ARE MANY WHO DO NOTHING. I EVEN LARGE COMPANIES IT'S NOT ON THEIR RADAR SO ANYWAY THE I THINK YOU I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT- THE ONE CALL CENTERS ARE DOING A VERY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE EDUCATION THAT'S HAPPENING STATEWIDE RIGHT NOW SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT FROM A RESOURCES POINT OF VIEW ABOUT RECEIVING THE NOTICES WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE IT WE DON'T SEE ANY BARRIERS AND NO BARRIERS THE SYSTEMS ALREADY IN PLACE WE CAN DO IT ONLINE TOO SO WANT TO BE A RESOURCES ISSUE NO PROBLEM- THE ELECTRON PAS RESPONSE THAT'S A BIG. DEAL THAT. THAT IS GOOD. IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE WORLD SAFER THIS IS PROVEN TO BE THE CASE IN MANY STATES THAT HAVE THIS THEIR STATE THAT I'VE HAD THIS FOR DECADES AND THIRD AND THERE'RE DAMAGE. RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. HOWEVER RIGHTNOW IT'S VOLUNTARY AS IT STARTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO NOW IT BECOMES MANDATORY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS A GOOD THING. OTHERS TALK ABOUT ALLOWING- EXEMPTIONS FOR MORE TIME FOR OPERATORS TO- COMPLY WITH THAT REQUIREMENT I WOULD- STRONGLY RECOMMEND THERE BE NO EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE THIS. IS BECAUSE OF THERE'S EVEN ONE EXEMPTION IT'S STILL VOLUNTARY. BASICALLY AND THE CONTRACTORS ARE NOT GOING TO USE IT. UNTIL THEY KNOW THAT IT'S MANDATORY. THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE WORDING REQUIRES THE EXCAVATOR THE- FACILITY OPERATORS TO RESPOND TO THE SYSTEM BUT THE WORDING OF THAT BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE EXCAVATOR TO CHECK THE SYSTEM BEFORE HE TAKES. AND I THINK THAT IS A PART THAT IS MISSING. BECAUSE WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO IF ALL THE FACILITY OPERATORS REPLY TO THE SYSTEM BUT THEN THE EXPANDER NEVER LOOKS AT THAT NOW I THINK THE GOOD ONES WILL. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD BUT THE OTHER ONES WON'T AND SO I- THE OTHER THING IS. THAT THE FUTURE OF THIS IS WHAT WE CALL IN THE INDUSTRY ENHANCE THE POSITIVE RESPONSE WERE NOT ONLY IS IT. A SO CAL GAS. OF INDICATED IN THE SYSTEM THAT THEY MARK THE LINE. BUT NOW THEY'VE ALSO UPLOADED ATTACHMENTS SUCH AS PICTURES MARKINGS AND LANDS. AND THE OTHER WAY THE EXCAVATOR COULD DO THAT IN THE BEGINNING THEY CAN SEND PICTURES OF THE DELINEATION AND WHITE TO SAY HERE'S MY DIG SITE SO THE SO CAL GAS KNOWS THAT. YEP THEY'VE BEEN THERE. SO MY LOCATOR IS GONNA BE ABLE TO FIND THE DIG SITE CORRECTLY AS WEL AS THEIR PLANS AND NOW THE PARTIES ARE TALKING. AND IF THEY WANT TO NEGOTIATE A LATER START TIME BECAUSE THE PROJECT IS BIGGER THERE- OTHER FACILITIES IN THE WAY THAT CAN'T BE LOCATE AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT CAN ALL BE DOCUMENTED IN THE SYSTEM. AND THEN REGULATORS LIKE SNAIL CAN COME IN AND- AND SEE THE HISTORY THERE. SO THAT THERE IS A DAMAGE AND THE HE SAID SHE SAID STUFF. IS GOES AWAY A LITTLE BIT MORE IF IT CAN ALL BE. CENTRALIZED SO THAT'S WHERE ENVISIONED THE FUTURE GOING- AND I'D LIKE TO. SEE LEGISLATION GET TO THAT POINT- I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY STATE TO HAS THAT IS MANDATORY I KNOW NORTH CAROLINA HAS IT VOLUNTARILY TO. THIS ENHANCED BUILT WHAT THE- ATTACHMENTS BEING IN PLACE BUT I THINK THAT CAN. YOU KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO DO IT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO IT. AND NOT JUST THE APART TELL WHEN IT I THINK WE OUGHT TO JUMP RIGHT IN AND BECOME A LEADER LIKE CALIFORNIA STRIVE TO BE IN EVERY WAY. INSTEAD OF A RELUCTANT FOLLOWER LIKE WE ARE NOW HIGHLIGHTED APPROACH WHICH ONE. THANK YOU. MISTER BOROUGH AT THE. THANK SAFE BORDERS YOU HEARD IS CLOSE TO THEM OF A FINANCIAL DEFICIT. AND CURRENTLY THERE FUNDING ARISES FROM A FEE ON THE OPERATORS AS MR WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERYTHING SEEMS TO GO TO FEED TO THE OPERATORS- I'VE HEARD ARGUMENTS THAT A SMALL FEE ON EXCAVATORS COULD FACILITATE MORE GREATER BY IN ON THE THAT FROM THE ACTUATOR COMMUNITY. TO THE WORK OBJECTIVES OF THE DIG SAY FORD- WHAT DO YOU FEEL THAT IT. THAT COULD ACHIEVE THOSE THAT AIM AND WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD WORK IN THE FUTURE A- I THINK THE OPTION IS THERE BUT I THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR A MUCH MORE DISCUSSION IN THAT REGARD SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DIS INCENTIVIZE. AND YOU KNOW I DEAL WITH A LARGER CONTRACTORS THAT THEY MAY NOT BE SUCH A BIG DEAL BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SMALLER GUYS THE GUYS WHO ARE DOING THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS WE DON'T CREATE A DISINCENTIVE. FOR THEM TO CALL EIGHT ONE ONE BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A PRICE TAG ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO IF YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. YOU KNOW I THINK THE DOORS OPEN TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IT WOULD BE GOOD I YOU KNO MAYBE SOME STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS YES THAT AND SEE HOW WE CAN BEST MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. WOULD BE GREAT. OF THOSE THIS IS THE END OF MY QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE ANY INTRICATE YOUR FEELING. I JUST TOOK NOTE OF YOUR SUGGESTION ABOUT THE LEGISLATION I THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DISCUSS IF THAT. IS RIGHT FOR SOMETHING THIS YEAR. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS QUITE ENLIGHTENING AND- REALLY QUITE TO THINK PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF THE INFORMATION AND WHERE WE GO FORWARD BUT BEFORE WE CONCLUDE WE WILL OPEN THIS TO PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE A COMMENT- TODAVíA FEEL FREE TO. COME FORWARD. NO IS NEVER JUST USE. ALL THESE PEOPLE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TODD BLOOM SIGN FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION GOT SOME NOTES BUT PROBABLY WON'T EVEN USE THOSE FIRST WANT TO COMPLEMENT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR DOG KITTY AND CONSISTENT INTEREST IN THIS AREA OF THE U. I. OVER THAT MEDIAN I DO. DOWN THE HALL YEAH AND YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST POINT THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT MEETING WAS WHEN PEOPLE AND EXCAVATORS CALL EIGHT ONE ONE- THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES GO TREMENDOUSLY DOWN A WHICH IS WHAT I THOUGHT TOO WELL WHAT I THINK STILL DOES THIS PROCESS REALLY REALLY ISN'T AND AS WE GET INTO SOME OF THE MORE DETAILS- PRESENTATIONS. IN AN AND DETAILED DISCUSSIONS YOU KNOW YOU. THERE'S SOME. THE DETAILS THAT NEED TO NEED TO BE WORKED OUT OF COURSE. WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD COMPLEMENT TO IS OUT OF THE P. UC'S INVESTIGATION- THAT HAS NOT BEEN DISCUSSED WHATSOEVR IN ANY OF THE DIXIE FOR BOARD MEETINGS WHICH IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK THAT A LOT OF INFORMATION CAN BE GLEANED FROM THAT. AND TAKE IN AND LOOKED AT OKAY WHAT ARE SOME SCENARIOS HAT WE COULD FIX SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW- IN IN IN THAT INVESTIGATION ONE OF THEM WAS AB ELEVEN SIXTY SIX BY MR LEVINE- THAT SPECIFICALLY WILL ENSURE THAT. THE TICKETS AREN'T GOING TO BE. SAY THIS PLAYED A FABRICATED OR OR OR CHANGED THAT WON'T HAPPEN ANYMORE INJURY BE ELEVEN SIXTY SIX THAT'S VERY VERY POSITIVE- ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO. TO CLARIFY IN AND I DONALD SLIGHTLY MISLEADING- WAS THAT THE DAMAGES ARE NOT BEING REPORTED WHATSOEVER. AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE A SECTION FORTY TWO SIXTEEN SEE ONE- IT IN IN IN AN INSTANT WHEN EXCAVATOR DAMAGES SOMETHING UNDERGROUND FIRST. FIRST CALL OF COURSE IS GOING TO BE NINE ONE ONE IF SOMEONE WAS INJURED- AND THEN THE STATUTE ALSO REQUIRES. THE CON THE EXCAVATOR TO CONTACT THE OPERATOR'S WELL- SO THAT THERE IS COMMUNICATION GOING ON- IT'S NOT AS IF WHILE WE'RE NOT GONNA CALL ANYONE AND NOT FOLLOW THROUGH- A COUPLE OTHER POINTS. AND I DIDN'T SAY SO SHOULD COMPLEMENT THE BOARD AS WELL THEY THEY'VE DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB THEY'VE BEEN VERY VERY THOROUGH VERY THOROUGH. VERY PROFESSIONAL OF THE PROVIDED OF SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN IN THE MEETINGS YEARS AGO A VENUE FOR OPERATORS AND EXCAVATORS TO COME TOGETHER ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER. AND THAT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY POSITIVE IN THE WORK PRODUCT THEY BRING OUT THE- PRODUCED- IS EXTRAORDINARY TO VERY DETAILED VERY THOROUGH SO WITH OUTSTANDING JOB THAT THEY'VE DONE. I THINK SCCA MY CLIENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A LITTLE BIT MORE MOVEMENT TOWARDS A DEVELOPING STANDARDS- WE WE'VE THE STATUTE SPECIFICALLY SPELL OUT TO THREE OR FOUR HOURS VERY SPECIFIC THINGS THE BOARD SHOULD BE DOING. DEVELOPING STANDARDS EDUCATING OUT REGION INVESTIGATIONS WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT HAT THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS FINDING OUT OKAY WHO'S NOT CALLING. YOU KNOW WHAT GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS DON'T CALL THROUGH THAT YOU THROUGH THAT INVESTIGATION THEN YOU CAN FOCUS THE EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS WHERE THERE'S- PEOPLE ARE CALLING A WERE THERE'S ISSUES- IN IN THE FIRST SENT. FIRST SET OF REGULATIONS THAT CAME THROUGH EARLIER THIS YEAR- THE REGULATIONS WERE FOCUSED ON SOME OF THE MY NEW SHOW OF. OF THE BOARD AND THEIR PROCESS- AND IN FACT IN NEW IF YOU'VE EVER READ REGULATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAY SPECIFICALLY THE BUT- AUTUMN. IS WHAT THE FORTY OF THE BOARD USED TO DOT THE REGULATION. AND IN ALL TWENTY TWO INSTANCES IT WAS THE PRODUCT FORTY GIVEN TO THE BOARD RATHER THAN THAT VERY SPECIFIC FORTY- DEALING WITH INVESTIGATIONS ARE STANDARD SO THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THE BOARD MOVE. IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ARMED VERY QUICKLY ON LIABILITY- IT DOES CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM- DOWN SOUTH AYE AYE CONTINUOUSLY HERE. REPORTS FROM CONTRACTORS- ABOUT ABOUT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT DAMAGES OCCURRING- WHERE THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO- YET. WEEKS OR MONTHS LATER THEY RECEIVE A CLAIM FROM. OF FROM THE UTILITY COMPANY AND WE HAD ONE CONTRACTORS HAPPY TO. INTRODUCE YOU TO HIM IN THAT COMPANY- WHERE THERE WAS A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM. AND THEY THEY FOUGHT THE CLAIM THEY SPENT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY ATTORNEYS FEES. SIMPLY TO DEFEND THE CLAIM AND DEFEND THEIR. GOOD NAME AGAINST IT THERE'S SOMETHING OF A OF A. IMBALANCE HERE- DEALING WITH RESOURCES AND EIGHTY THOUSAND CONTRACTORS A RELATIVELY SMALL COMPARED TO SOME MAJOR- INTERNATIONALLY OR NATIONALLY TREATED COMPANIES. THANK YOU AGAIN CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN USERS STROKES AND ONE QUESTIONS FOR OUR USE SAYING THAT ALL OF YOUR CLIENTS. REPORT EVERY DAY AGAIN ALL I CAN I CERTAINLY CAN'T HARD AFTER THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE DEADLINE I'M I'M SURE THERE ARE NO OKAY. AS WITH THE STATUTE DOES THOSE REQUIRE CLIMB IN IN ANY ANY REPUTABLE COMPANY IN IN THE STATE IS NATURALLY GOING TO DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING IT YOU WANT TO HAVE THE FINAL WORD A LITTLE JUST- IN ONE WHEN I WAS MAKING THE COMMENTS ABOUT- DAMAGE IS NOT BEING REPORTED I JUST MEANT THAT NO ONE IS SEEING THE ENTIRE BIG PICTURE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF THE LAW REQUIRES THE EXCAVATOR TO REPORT THE DAMAGE TO THE OPERATOR WHOSE LIFE HE CUT. SO CAL GAS KNOWS HOW MANY HITS THEY'VE HAD ANY TO TELL THE ORDER GETS THAT FROM THEIR EXHIBITORS BUT NO ONE IS SEEING A AN AGGREGATE SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPRESS EARLIER WHEN I SAID NOTHING'S BEING REPORTED TO A- TO A CENTRAL PLACE TO COLLECT BECAUSE EVEN YOU KNOW SEE- CPC HAS. GAS HITS REPORTED TO THEM BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE OTHER SECTORS AND SO NO ONE ELSE HAS IT. ON THE STATE WIDE LEVELS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE. THANK YOU. OTHER POP PUBLIC COMMENT. WE SURE DO YOU HAVE A- COMMENT HEY I JUST A I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO REINFORCE WHAT JAMES BROUGHT UP VERY EARLY ON THAT AS FAR AS ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT COME FORTH. I IAN WE'VE NOTED AND- STRESS BEFORE FOR GAS SPECIALLY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ANY DAMAGES ANY HIT. BE REPORTED- AND CAPTURED- NOT JUST FOR DATA PURPOSES BUT BECAUSE THAT IT. IT CREATES A POTENTIAL FUTURE PROBLEM FRONT FOR A GAS LINE SO. WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL. NOT TO REDUCE WHAT CURRENTLY REQUIRED. AS WE YOU KNOW ANY IN REPORTING THAT WE PROCEED FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR JANET WOULD LIKE TO. BEFORE WE CLOSE AND IT COMES OUT VERY GOOD THANK YOU. WELL THIS WAS QUITE INFORMATIVE AND- ON A- I THINK WE DISCUSSED A LOT OF CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUES THAT- THIS IS. THE BIG SAY FORD IS BEEN UNDERTAKING WORKING ON AND- TRYING TO RESOLVE AND CREATE THAT CLARIFICATION COMMUNICATION AND EDUCATION IN THE- THE FIELD SO THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK. THE BOARD HAS BEEN DOING AND FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE BOARD THANK YOU. FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE AND CONTINUE TO DO THAT. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. EVERYONE IN THE NEXT YEAR SO WITH THERE ARE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO BRING FORWARD. LEGISLATIVELY WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THOSE IN AND ADDRESS THEM SO WE ALL KNOW THAT. THESE PROBLEMS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY DO NOT FIX THEMSELVES THEY NEED A LOT OF GOOD SUPPORT GOOD HEALTH. AND IN THE WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT AND I THINK THE WILLINGNESS IS IN THIS ROOM ANSWER THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. THE FOR THE BUSINESS. THE HEARING TO GERMAN THANK YOU ALL
