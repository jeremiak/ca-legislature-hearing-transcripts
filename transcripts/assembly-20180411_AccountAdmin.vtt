THIS BILL AND AMENDING IT I

00:31:54.312 --> 00:31:57.215 region:rollup2
THINK WE'VE REMOVED A LOT OF THE

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.785 region:rollup2
SO A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THE

AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.

00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:11.963 region:rollup2
AT NO CHARGE BECAUSE IT'S

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:13.565 region:rollup2
TAXPAYER FUNDED BASICALLY

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:14.966 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY FUNDED.

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.134 region:rollup2

MONTHS THEN.

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:25.510 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE A

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:27.245 region:rollup2
CHARGE FOR THAT RESEARCH IT

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.647 region:rollup2

FALCONE I'M THE LEGISLATIVE

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:01.780 region:rollup2
COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC

00:33:01.847 --> 00:33:04.282 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE ARE A A LEAN

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.317 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:07.319 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE OVER FOUR ONE

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:09.020 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DUES PAYING MEMBERS.

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:10.355 region:rollup2
MANY OF THEM HERE CALIFORNIA AND

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.058 region:rollup2
WE FOCUS ON POLICIES THAT

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:13.425 region:rollup2
BENEFIT THE USERS AND CREATORS

00:33:13.058 --> 00:33:14.626 region:rollup2
OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:16.261 region:rollup2
I IN THE WORDS OF SIR ISAAC

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:16.895 region:rollup2
NEWTON AND I HAVE SEEN FURTHER

00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:17.929 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I STOOD ON THE SHOULDERS

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:19.331 region:rollup2
OF GIANTS.

00:33:17.929 --> 00:33:20.699 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO PASS INFORMATION

00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:21.766 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY ADVANCES THE

00:33:20.699 --> 00:33:22.868 region:rollup2
PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE AND

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:24.803 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S

00:33:22.868 --> 00:33:25.904 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW OUR

00:33:24.803 --> 00:33:27.372 region:rollup2
GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

00:33:25.904 --> 00:33:29.140 region:rollup2
PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE. IN

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:31.376 region:rollup2
ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.078 region:rollup2
THE PREMISE IS SIMPLE ENSURE

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:34.312 region:rollup2
THAT TAXPAYER FUNDED RESEARCH

00:33:33.078 --> 00:33:35.647 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE THAT IS GENERATED BY

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:38.316 region:rollup2
OUR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT ACT AS

00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:39.517 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS IS DISSEMINATED FOR

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:40.852 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.987 region:rollup2
IN THE WORLD.

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.421 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOME OF THIS POLICY IS

00:33:41.987 --> 00:33:44.656 region:rollup2
IMMEASURABLE.

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:46.524 region:rollup2
WHEN GOVERNMENT USED THEIR POWER

00:33:44.656 --> 00:33:48.226 region:rollup2
TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:49.227 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS AND FALL ONE USERS.

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:51.429 region:rollup2
IT ADVANCES EVERYONE TO SEE

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:52.430 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:54.032 region:rollup2
THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF THE

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.534 region:rollup2
REVERSE TOO MANY RESTRAINTS ARE

00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:57.168 region:rollup2
RENTS APPLY TO INFORMATION CAN

00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:58.770 region:rollup2
HAVE TRAGIC RESULTS.

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:59.538 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:00.939 region:rollup2
TWELVE.

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:02.274 region:rollup2
MALARIA RESEARCHER.

00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:03.308 region:rollup2
BY NAME OF CARDINALS

00:34:02.274 --> 00:34:05.310 region:rollup2
NOTED THAT WHILE WESTERN

00:34:03.308 --> 00:34:07.279 region:rollup2
SOCIETIES HAVE MADE ADVANCEMENTS

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:09.514 region:rollup2
AND TREATMENT FOR MALARIA SUB

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:11.349 region:rollup2
SAHARAN AFRICA WITH LACKEY.

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:13.385 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR THIS DISPARITY MORE

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:14.920 region:rollup2
THAN HALF OF THE REQUISITE

00:34:13.385 --> 00:34:16.421 region:rollup2
INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THOSE

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.956 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS WAS BEHIND A PAYWALL.

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:19.224 region:rollup2
AND RESEARCHERS AND MEDICAL

00:34:17.956 --> 00:34:20.191 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS AND SOME OF THE

00:34:19.224 --> 00:34:22.027 region:rollup2
MOST IMPOVERISHED NATIONS OF THE

00:34:20.191 --> 00:34:23.695 region:rollup2
WORLD SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO

00:34:22.027 --> 00:34:24.162 region:rollup2
PAY FOR ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:26.064 region:rollup2
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:27.098 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED.

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.967 region:rollup2
WHEN WE MAKE THIS INFORMATION

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:29.668 region:rollup2
FREE TO ACCESS

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:31.570 region:rollup2
WE MAKE OF THE ADVANCEMENTS MORE

00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:33.138 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT AND LOW COST.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.372 region:rollup2
TODAY MOST FEDERAL GRANTS FOR

00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:35.340 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CARE THE

00:34:34.372 --> 00:34:37.275 region:rollup2
SAME REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.809 region:rollup2
PROPOSES TODAY.

00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:39.044 region:rollup2
BUT OTHERS ARE GOING EVEN

00:34:37.809 --> 00:34:40.645 region:rollup2
FURTHER.

00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:42.280 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL MELINDA

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:44.149 region:rollup2
GATES FOUNDATION THEY HAVE OPEN

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.317 region:rollup2
ACCESS POLICY THAT RESEARCH THEY

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:46.117 region:rollup2
PRODUCE IS AVAILABLE THE DAY OF

00:34:45.317 --> 00:34:48.653 region:rollup2
PUBLICATION THE DAY OF

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:50.855 region:rollup2
PUBLICATION.

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:52.390 region:rollup2
AND COME INTO THAT SIXTEEN WHEN

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:54.492 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS FIRST OBSERVED

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:56.461 region:rollup2
GRAVITATIONAL WAVES CONFIRMING

00:34:54.492 --> 00:34:58.296 region:rollup2
EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY.

00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:58.830 region:rollup2
THEY MERELY PUBLISHED THEIR

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:00.498 region:rollup2
FINDINGS IN AN OPEN ACCESS

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.333 region:rollup2
JOURNAL.

00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:02.767 region:rollup2
IF I MAKE ONE FINAL POINT ABOUT

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:05.070 region:rollup2
THE BENEFITS OF OPEN ACT OPEN

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:06.304 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND THE

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.773 region:rollup2
BENEFITS IT IT PROVIDES.

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:10.742 region:rollup2
THE INTERNET AS WE KNOW

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:11.743 region:rollup2
CONNECTS EVERY PERSON WHO AND

00:35:10.742 --> 00:35:13.111 region:rollup2
GIVES EVERYONE THE ABILITY TO

00:35:11.743 --> 00:35:15.013 region:rollup2
SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT WE WERE

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:16.948 region:rollup2
PRESENTED. SOMETIMES RESOLVING

00:35:15.013 --> 00:35:18.016 region:rollup2
THESE PROBLEMS JUST REQUIRE A A

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:20.218 region:rollup2
NEW PERSPECTIVE IN A FRESH ANNA

00:35:18.016 --> 00:35:22.253 region:rollup2
AND FRESH SET OF EYES.

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:23.655 region:rollup2
I TAKE JACK AND DRAKA WHO AT THE

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:25.123 region:rollup2
AGE OF SIXTEEN.

00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.257 region:rollup2

AND DEVELOPED A METHOD TO DETECT

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:34.399 region:rollup2
A RARE FORM OF CANCER.

00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:35.233 region:rollup2
JACK IS WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE

00:35:34.399 --> 00:35:37.002 region:rollup2
FURTHER BY STANDING ON THE

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:38.536 region:rollup2
SHOULDERS OF GIANTS

00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:40.005 region:rollup2

.

00:36:09.768 --> 00:36:12.971 region:rollup2
THIS IS DIRECTLY LINED WITH OUR

AND TO SAY IT'S A SIMPLY.

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:24.983 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IS NOT MEANT TO SIT ON

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:27.786 region:rollup2
A SHELF.

00:36:24.983 --> 00:36:29.054 region:rollup2

ABLE TO PASS ON. A BILL FOCUSING

00:48:48.159 --> 00:48:50.594 region:rollup2
