STATE IN THE EVENT OF A FELONY

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:15.313
INVESTIGATION -- MOST OF THE

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.715
OTHER TIMES IT IS CONSENSUAL

00:25:16.781 --> 00:25:18.250
HOWEVER THERE ARE IMPORTANT

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:20.118
OCCASIONS WHERE'S CONSENT CANNOT

JUDGE AS TO THE REASONABLE TEST

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.775

ONE WAY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES THIS

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:09.514
IS BY SETTING A GENERAL RULE

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:25.056
ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.991
CRIMES -- IT IS CERTAINLY OUR

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:28.393
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:29.961
OTHER MEANS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:31.829
TO GET ON THIS KIND OF

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:32.931
INFORMATION OUT THERE THERE MAY

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:35.200
NOT BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:36.568
AT ALL AND CERTAINLY.

00:30:36.634 --> 00:30:42.941
IN CASES WHERE THERE IS NO NO.

00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:44.576
INTENT TO PROSECUTE THERE ARE

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:46.477
WAYS TO GET INFORMATION.

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:47.779
FROM THE VEHICLE SUCH AS THROUGH

00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:50.348
A SUBPOENA -- SO WHEN WHEN A

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:50.982
DRIVERS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.516
AND THERE IS NO CRIMINAL

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:52.517
PROSECUTION LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:53.751
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUBPOENA THAT

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:55.353
INFORMATION FROM THE VEHICLES

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.688
DATA RECORDER WE ASK FOR YOUR NO

00:30:56.754 --> 00:30:58.556
VOTE.

00:30:58.623 --> 00:30:59.290
THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.125
WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.927
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.996
MEMBERS I MOVE THE BILL ESTERMAN

00:31:05.063 --> 00:31:08.166
SECOND.

00:31:08.233 --> 00:31:10.134
AND THE QUESTION.

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.369
SO IS IT TRUE THAT THE BILL

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:12.270
WOULD ALLOW FOR SEARCH WARRANTS

00:31:12.337 --> 00:31:15.573
FOR NON CRIMINAL ACTIVITY -- I

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:16.441
WOULD BELIEVE THAT STATE CASES

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:19.010
IS NOT.

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.346
WILL IT WOULD ALLOW SEARCH

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:25.149
WARRANTS FOR A A PUBLIC OFFENSE

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.118
WHAT.

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.353
BY MAKE -- THE WAY THIS MOST

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:29.988
OFTEN COMES UP YOU HAVE THEY'RE

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:31.122
THE WORST CASES OF AND MANY

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.123
ROUTE INSTANCES OF PROSECUTORS

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.757
DEAL WITH.

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.293
A MISDEMEANOR -- VEHICULAR

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.394
MANSLAUGHTER IN WHICH IT'S OF

00:31:36.461 --> 00:31:37.328
THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:38.363
THING SOMEBODY'S INATTENTIVE FOR

00:31:38.429 --> 00:31:40.531
A PERIOD OF TIME -- REACHING

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:42.166
OVER AND YOU KNOW DOING

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.868
SOMETHING AND DRIVES OFF THE

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:45.970
ROTOR CAUSES A COLLISION.

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:47.272
OR SOMETHING.

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:49.440
THAT'S A THAT'S POTENTIALLY A

00:31:49.507 --> 00:31:50.875
MISDEMEANOR ENABLE IT YOU'RE

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.744
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE A

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.912
CERTAIN -- CAUTION THE THE

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:55.947
ORDINARY PERSON WOULD WHILE

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:58.616
YOU'RE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE --

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:00.184
THE THIS WOULD ALLOW AN

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:02.253
INVESTIGATOR TO EVALUATE WHETHER

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.755
THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.056
WITH THE CAR SOMETHING ELSE

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:07.091
HAPPENING IN ORDER TO DETERMINE

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:09.227
WHETHER CRIMINAL CHARGES IT'S A

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:10.762
MISDEMEANOR IN THIS CASE WOULD

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.063
EVEN BE APPROPRIATE.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.798
WE FILE MISDEMEANORS PROSECUTORS

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:16.567
FILE MISDEMEANORS EVERY DAY --

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:18.102
UNFORTUNATELY IN MISDEMEANOR --

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:21.472
VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER CASES --

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.441
BECAUSE A PERSON WAS AN

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:24.375
ATTENTIVE ON THE ROAD AND

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:25.310
SOMEONE DIED OR WAS SERIOUSLY

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:26.711
INJURED AS A RESULT OF IT.

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:29.280
THIS IS JUST AN INVESTIGATIVE

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:32.817
TOOL -- TO ALLOW AN OFFICER --

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:34.686
TO MAKE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.354
USING THE BEST AVAILABLE

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.389
EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.224
BE THE THE BLACK BOX TO

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.393
DETERMINE IN A VERY NARROW FIVE

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.795
SECOND PERIOD WHETHER ANYTHING

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:45.296
WAS GOING ON WITH THE CAR.

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:50.335
THAT COULD BE A CONTRIBUTING OR

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:54.706
EXONERATING FACTOR.

00:32:54.772 --> 00:32:57.642
DOES IT IS TO THEY SO YOU DOES

00:32:57.709 --> 00:32:58.710
NOT CONCERNING THIS COULD SERVE

00:32:58.776 --> 00:32:59.644
AFTER SERVE OPEN THE DOOR IN A

00:32:59.711 --> 00:32:59.911
WAY THAT.

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:01.713
CAN BE VERY CONCERNING THE FACT

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.781
THAT THEY CAN BE A SURCHARGE FOR

00:33:03.848 --> 00:33:06.351
NON CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:07.618
YES CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT

00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:10.054
IS A CONCERN -- I I ALSO

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:10.922
QUESTION.

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:12.490
IF IT IS LIMITED TO CRIMINAL

00:33:12.557 --> 00:33:13.624
ACTIVITY THEN I'M NOT SURE IF IT

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:16.227
GETS OUT THE SITUATION OF THE

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:17.528
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OLD OBERNOLTE

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.196
HAS.

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:18.996
HAS CITED -- BUT YEAH WE WE

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.465
CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE CONCERNS

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:22.300
ABOUT ANY -- SEARCH WARRANT

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.102
BEING USED IT WHETHER IT THERE

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:26.137
IS NO -- CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:28.005
INVOLVED IN AGAIN I YOU KNOW I I

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.540
I CERTAINLY AM NO EXPERT IN HOW

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:31.943
LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATES--

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:33.044
INCIDENCES.

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:34.112
WHERE THERE IS NO CRIME

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:37.148
SUSPECTED BUT BUT I THINK THAT

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.983
THEY DO HAVE MEANS OTHER THAN

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.550
SEARCH WARRANTS AT THEIR?

00:33:39.617 --> 00:33:40.351
AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO GET

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:41.953
INFORMATION OUT TO TO BE CLEAR

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.054
WE DISAGREE WITH THE ACLU'S

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.222
ASSESSMENT THAT A SUBPOENA COULD

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:49.160
BE USED IN THOSE KINDS OF

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:51.262
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:51.929
THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IS

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:52.930
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT REALLY HAS

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:54.832
NO TOOLS WHEN THERE'S A SOLE

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:55.800
OCCUPANT OF VEHICLE THE HE'S THE

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:56.934
OWNER OF THE VEHICLE.

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:59.070
AND UNFORTUNATELY IS DECEASED AS

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:03.975
A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.076
IN THE IN THE SITUATION YOU

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:06.677
DESCRIBED WOULDN'T IT BE

00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:09.113
POSSIBLE TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:10.581
IF THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE IF YOU

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.316
WERE ABLE TO SHOW PROBABLE CAUSE

00:34:12.383 --> 00:34:14.919
OUT IN A MISDEMEANOR NOT IN AS

00:34:14.986 --> 00:34:15.453
SOON AS YOU CAN ONLY DO A

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.020
PROBABLE.

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:17.321
HEARING IN A BALLOT A

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:18.156
MISDEMEANOR THE SUBPOENA CAN

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:21.292
ONLY BE ISSUED AFTER THIS IS

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:21.859
WHERE WE DISAGREE WITH OUR

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:22.493
FRIENDS FROM THE DEAL YOU ONLY

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.629
AFTER A CASE HAS BEEN FILED --

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:25.062
SEARCH WARRANT IS AN

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:29.233
INVESTIGATIVE TOOL TO HELP YOU

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.401
FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT.

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:31.569
SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT

00:34:31.636 --> 00:34:32.103
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANY

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.571
PROBABLE CAUSE STANDARD WHICH WE

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:34.972
HAVE IN FELONY SETTING IS THAT

00:34:35.039 --> 00:34:36.374
RIGHT ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:38.976
PROBABLE CAUSE BECAUSE IT'S GOT

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.178
TO GO TO A JUDGE.

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:41.412
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD A JUDGE AND

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.948
THE JUDGE WOULD DO A PROBLEM

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:44.782
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY ONE YOU HAVE

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:46.350
GOT BRING AFFIDAVIT OF PROBABLE

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:47.418
CAUSE TO THE JUDGE HE WHICH SHE

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:47.985
WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW IT AND

00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:49.086
DETERMINE THERE WAS PROBABLE

00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:50.054
CAUSE. FOR ISSUANCE OF THE

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:53.591
SEARCH WARRANT GOT THANK YOU FOR

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.226
CLARIFICATION.

00:34:55.293 --> 00:34:56.561
YES MISTER LACKEY I THINK THERE

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.195
MIGHT BE A DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT

00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:59.230
QUALIFIES AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE

00:34:59.297 --> 00:35:00.498
TO BECAUSE IT.

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:01.999
IN THE BILL IT TALKS ABOUT A

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.534
PUBLIC OFFENSE WHICH CAL ALSO

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:05.570
INCLUDE JUST A FRACTION LIKE

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.271
RUNNING A RED LIGHT.

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:08.172
AND SO MANY OF THESE INSTANCES

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:09.340
YOU HAVE.

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:09.974
AND AND MANSLAUGHTER CASES YOU

00:35:10.041 --> 00:35:11.742
HAVE TO HAVE A DEATH.

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:13.778
AND MANY OF THESE CASES ARE JUST

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:14.946
VERY VERY SERIOUS INJURIES AND

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:17.748
ONE THING THAT.

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.350
THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE USED.

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:21.018
EXCESSIVELY BECAUSE IT IT TAKES

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:25.122
A HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:26.924
UNDERSTANDING TO EVEN.

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.526
COLLECT THIS DATA AND UNDERSTAND

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:29.994
AND INTERPRET WHAT IT WHAT IT

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:32.964
SAYS -- THIS EVENT DATA RECORDER

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.799
IS.

00:35:34.866 --> 00:35:36.601
EVIDENTIARY VALUE THAT SHOULD BE

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:38.102
ACCESSED AND THERE'S THERE'S

00:35:38.169 --> 00:35:39.871
PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:40.838
YOU'RE HAVING THE JUDICIAL

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.473
REVIEW LIKE I WOULD HOPE WE ALL

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:43.774
WOULD TRUST THE JUDGE WOULD MAKE.

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.243
THE APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT OF

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:48.513
WHETHER THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE.

00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:49.814
TO ACCESS THIS INFORMATION AND

00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:51.182
SO I THINK THERE'S A BUILT IN

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:52.416
PROTECTION THERE AND I THANK YOU

00:35:52.483 --> 00:35:53.684
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD.

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:56.287
BECAUSE ACCURACY INVESTIGATIONS

00:35:56.354 --> 00:35:57.955
ARE SOCIAL PIVOTAL AND NOT JUST

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.624
IN.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.493
OF MANSLAUGHTER CASES RIGHT A

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.394
LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:03.961
HAVE.

00:36:04.028 --> 00:36:07.031
LOST FUNCTION AND WHO HAVE LOST --

00:36:07.098 --> 00:36:08.699
THE ABILITY TO LIVE A NORMAL

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:11.068
LIFE BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS ACTED

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.436
INAPPROPRIATELY BUT YET THEY

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:13.871
HAVE A VERBAL DEFENSE.

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:15.273
AND LEST WE HAVE PHYSICAL

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:17.208
DEFENSE TO REFUTE THAT BECAUSE

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:19.810
VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO ARRIVE AT

00:36:19.877 --> 00:36:23.681
A POINT OF JUSTICE AND SO I'VE I

00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:24.282
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING THIS

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:26.450
FORWARD.

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:28.920
THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.721
YOU MAY CLOSE MISS OBERNOLTE

00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:31.689
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I AM

00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:32.623
VERY SENSITIVE TO THE NEED TO

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.259
PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY AND THE

00:36:35.326 --> 00:36:36.827
CONSUMERS INFORMATION IN.

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.029
THE EVENT DATA RECORDER AND

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:40.031
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CRAFTED THIS

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:40.531
SO NARROWLY.

IN SUCH A A VERY LIMITED WAY SO

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.569
TO BE CLEAR YOU'D HAVE TO OBTAIN

00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:46.871
A SEARCH WARRANT WHICH MEANS

00:36:46.938 --> 00:36:47.471

IN MY COUNTY -- AB ELEVEN TWENTY

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:02.606

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.382
THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION LAW

00:44:11.448 --> 00:44:12.616
CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE

00:44:12.683 --> 00:44:14.051
INDIVIDUAL THE INDIVIDUALS

MENTAL DISORDER WAS A

00:44:15.052 --> 00:44:16.754
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.287
COMMISSION OF THE CHARGED

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:18.222
OFFENSE.

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:19.423
THIS MEANS THAT THE CRIMINAL

IS A DRIVING FACTOR IN THE

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:27.898
COMMISSION OF THAT CONDUCT.

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.199
NOW WE HAVE LIMITED MENTAL

WE APPRECIATE THE PROFFERED

AMENDMENT AND WE THOUGHT THAT

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.989
WAS VERY REASONABLE THAT SOMEONE

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.791
WOULD GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS FOR

00:46:00.858 --> 00:46:02.392
THE DURATION OF THE MENTAL

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:05.496
HEALTH -- DIVERSION.

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:10.000
WHAT IS NOT REASONABLE ABOUT AB

00:46:10.067 --> 00:46:10.534
ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS THAT

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.069
BASICALLY IT WOULD TREAT

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:14.004
CALIFORNIANS WHO ACCEPT MENTAL

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:15.272
HEALTH TREATMENT?

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:17.207
AND HAVE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.575
SOMEONE WHO HAS NO CRIMINAL

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:21.612
RECORD MORE HARSHLY THAN THOSE

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.113
WHO REFUSE MENTAL HEALTH

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:23.847
TREATMENT.

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:26.416
AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY CONVICTED

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:30.220
OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.956
IN THAT RESPECT AB TWO ELEVEN

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:33.924
TWENTY ONE UNDERMINES EXISTING

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:36.160
LAW IN ITS GOAL TO KEEP PEOPLE

00:46:36.226 --> 00:46:37.694
FROM SUFFERING THE LONG TERM

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.863
CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRIMINAL

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:41.665
CONVICTION WHILE PROMOTING

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.534
PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.004
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.606
ALTHOUGH -- MISS LEWIS HAS TOLD

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:51.942
YOU ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.443
COMMITTED VIOLENT OFFENSES.

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.112
YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND PEOPLE WHO

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.780
HAVE COMMITTED NONVIOLENT

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:59.283
OFFENSES SHOPLIFTING WHATEVER

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.952
AND THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:03.453
MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.788
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MENTAL

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:08.425
ILLNESSES THAT DO NOT HAVE IN

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:12.763
THE APPRECIABLE RECORD. FOR

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:15.666
VIOLENCE -- CLINICAL DEPRESSION

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:16.567
WE DON'T HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT

00:47:16.633 --> 00:47:18.835
PEOPLE GOING OUT AND COMMITTING

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:20.337
VIOLENT OFFENSES WHO ARE

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:22.139
CLINICALLY DEPRESSED.

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:25.042
AND THESE INDIVIDUALS IF THEY

00:47:25.108 --> 00:47:27.678
CHOOSE TO ACCEPT DIVERSION ARE

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:30.547
ACCEPTING WHAT IN MOST URBAN

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:32.416
COUNTIES WOULD BE.

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:34.952
ON A MUCH MORE ONEROUS COURSE

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:37.321
THEN IF THEY JUST ACCEPTED WHAT

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:38.388
WOULD BE THE TYPICAL PLEA

00:47:38.455 --> 00:47:39.823
BARGAIN.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.726
IN OAKLAND OR LA WHICH WOULD BE

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:44.328
CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED.

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:47.864
PROBATION AND OUTDOOR.

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:51.001
AND IF THEY ACCEPTED THAT.

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.369
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY MENTAL

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:53.737
HEALTH TREATMENT.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:55.138
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:58.041
PROHIBITION AGAINST WEAPONS.

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.476
THEY JUST BE GOING ON ABOUT

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:02.246
THEIR BUSINESS [inaudible]

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:04.248
SO.

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:05.682
THE VERSION MENTAL HEALTH TO

00:48:05.749 --> 00:48:08.919
VERSION WAS PASSED WITH THE GOAL

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:11.488
OF TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:12.990
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:14.458
DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:15.993
SUFFERING FROM UNDERLYING MENTAL

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.262
ILLNESS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:20.330
WERE ALL SAFE.

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.065
THIS BILL THREATENS THE

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:23.734
PARTICIPATION.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.703
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T JUST ON BAND

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.572
FIRE ARMS.

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:31.375
IT BANS ALL DEADLY WEAPONS.

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:33.577
SO FOR EXAMPLE A KITCHEN KNIFE

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.178
COULD BE A DEADLY WEAPON RIGHT

00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:36.780
YOU GO INTO YOUR KITCHEN AND YOU

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.548
PULL OUT A BUTCHER KNIFE THAT'S

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:40.484
A DOUBLE WEAPON -- IT COULD BE

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.784
[inaudible]

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:44.221
SO.

00:48:44.288 --> 00:48:45.756
AND THEN.

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:48.292
THE PART OF THE THAT YOU KNOW

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:49.459
THE PART THAT THE EMPHASIS THE

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.827
PROFFERED AMENDMENT MADE A LOT

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:52.195
OF SENSE IT WOULD BE.

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:55.165
WHILE SOMEONE WAS ON DIVERSION

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:57.100
THEY WOULD GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS.

00:48:57.167 --> 00:49:00.070
BUT IN THIS SCENARIO UNDER THE

00:49:00.137 --> 00:49:02.673
WAY THAT AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:04.041
WRITTEN RIGHT NOW.

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:06.877
IT IS A PERMANENT BAN.

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:10.213
UNLESS YOU GO BACK TO THE JUDGE.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.516
AND THE JUDGE THEN IS FACED WITH

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:17.621
THE THE MAKING A DECISION.

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:18.789
WELL THIS PERSON HAS SOUTH SOUTH

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.691
FULLY COMPLETED DIVERSION BUT

00:49:20.757 --> 00:49:22.659
THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF MENTAL

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:23.827
ILLNESS.

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:25.862
AM I GOING TO BE THE JUDGE TO

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:26.930
RETURN THEIR GUN.

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.665
AM I GOING TO BE THE JUDGE TO

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.835
LIFT THE BAN ON DEADLY WEAPONS.

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:34.037
SO ONCE THAT HAPPENS YOU'RE

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:35.872
GOING TO CREATE IN MANY PLACES A

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:39.142
BARK TO PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:40.844
THE DIVERSION PROGRAM.

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:43.280
AND FOR THOSE REASONS FOR

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.381
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE.

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:46.350

CAN YOU JUST -- TALK ABOUT THE

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:02.265
POINT THAT WAS RAISED THAT

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.967
KITCHEN KNIVES WOULD NOT BE ABLE

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.602
TO BE USED AS IT IS IT NARROWLY

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:06.937
FOCUSED ON FIREARMS OR IS IT

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:08.405

THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.182
THIS BILL -- GIVEN THE PRESSURE

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:20.584
FOR TIME AND SOME COMPLICATIONS

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:21.852
I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT BOTH LA

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:24.321
COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY RD.

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:26.957
THIS IS THEIR PRACTICE -- AND SO

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:27.824
ONE OF THE COMPLICATING FACTORS

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:28.925
AS WE NEED TO ENSURE WE WRITE A

00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:30.093
BILL THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.495

WE'VE SEEN THE TYPES OF ABUSES

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:30.046
THAT OCCURED WHEN SUCH STANDARDS

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:31.547

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.159
GET THEIR NAMES OFF OF THAT LIST.
