DOES IT SHOW THE BAY IT AS SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES IS THE SAME SIZE. NO NOT NOT THIS ON EARNED. SO MAYBE YOU JUST [inaudible] A PICTURE. WHOLE AM THERE GOES. THAT GO DOWN NO [inaudible] IT. THOSE A LITTLE FORESHADOWING I THINK. I'M [inaudible] OKAY -- PLEASE SIR. ALRIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- YOU APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PREP PRESENT ACA -- SIXTEEN WHICH IS WOULD ESSENTIALLY REFORM THE STATE SENATE -- TO PROVIDE FOR MORE EQUALITY OF OF REPRESENTATION AMONG THE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA AND SO. IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THIS VISUAL WHAT WE DO IS. AS WE DIVIDE THE STATE INTO EIGHT SEPARATE REGIONS AND THAT I THINK YOU KNOW AND AND AND ONE OF THINGS UP POINT OUT AS YOU KNOW I'M NOT I'M CITY NOT TIED TO THIS EXACT. FORMAT BUT I WANT HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE MODERNIZE OUR REPRESENTATION IN THE STATE -- BUT WITH THE WAY WE PROPOSE TO DO THIS IS TO DIVIDE THE STATE AND EIGHT REGIONS THAT I THINK. REFLECT THE THE DIFFERENT SUB REGION SAID YOU KNOW AND IN SOME WAYS YOU COULD THINK OF SUB STATES. OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT REFLECT ITS ITS DIVERSITY OF OF INDUSTRIES OF OF CULTURE A OF REGIONS AND ALLOWS EACH OF THOSE REGIONS TO HAVE AN EQUAL PLACE AT THE TABLE. IN THE STATE SENATE'S OF EACH REGION. WHAT ELECT FIVE STATE SENATORS AND? IT'S MORE REFLECTIVE OF OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL THE FEDERAL MODEL -- A OF THE LEGISLATURE WHERE YOU HAVE ONE HOUSE BASED COMPLETELY ON POPULATION IN ONE HOUSE -- PROVIDING FOR EQUALITY OF OF REPRESENTATION AMONG THE STATES IN THE CASE OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT -- HERE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THESE EIGHT REGIONS -- SO LOOK I'M YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS PROBABLY. NOT SOMETHING THAT'S LOOKED -- YOU KNOW VERY HIGHLY UPON BY THE THEM ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE URBAN PARTS. A OF CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU IS. TO AT LEAST REFLECT UPON -- REPRESENTATION AND WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS YOU KNOW IS IT JUST BASED ON POPULATIONS POPULATION SOLELY WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPRESENTATION I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S NOT IN FACT? OUR FOUNDERS ACTUALLY POINTED THAT OUT -- IN THE FEDERALIST PAPERS. WHEN THEY SAID ABOUT IT IN RELEVANT PART AND IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE IN A REPUBLIC NOT ONLY TO GUARD? THE SOCIETY AGAINST THE OPPRESSION OF ITS RULERS. BUT TO GUARD ONE PART OF SOCIETY AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF ANOTHER PART. DIFFERENT INTERESTS NECESSARILY EXIST IN DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CITIZENS IF THE MAJORITY BE UNITED BY ONE COMMON INTEREST IN THE INTEREST THE RIGHTS OF THE MINORITY. WILL BE INSECURE. AND SO WHAT WE SET UP IN THE FEDERAL MODEL WAS A WAVE OF GUARDING AGAINST THAT OF HAVING CHECKS AND BALANCES AGAINST. OF THE TYRANNY OF OF THE WITH THAT THERE CAN BE A TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY YOU KNOW WHEN OF WHEN A MAJORITY. AND IS EITHER TEMPERED BY -- YOU KNOW THE DEMAGOGUERY OR OTHERWISE -- THEY CAN THEY CAN USE THAT MAJORITY THAT ROB POWER. TWO VIOLATE OF THE RIGHTS OF OF MINORITIES [inaudible] AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE GUARDING AGAINST BUT THE FACT OF THEMATTER HERE HERE IN CALIFORNIA'S WE HAVE NO SUCH GUARD. WE ELECTED GOVERNOR BASED ON ROB MAJORITY PLURALITY. WE ELECT ALL OF OUR ALL OF OUR LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS ARE BASED PURELY ON POPULATION AND ARE ELECTED BY ROB POLITICAL -- PLURALITIES ARE MAJORITIES -- OUR OUR EVEN OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ARE UP FOR ELECTION EVERY SEVEN YEARS. AND THAT VOTE IS OF AGAIN A ROB POLITICAL MAJORITY THERE IS NO. CHECK LIKE WE HAVE WITH THE U. S. SENATE AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN PLACE A IN THE US GOVERNMENT TO HELP PROVIDE THOSE CHECKS. AND AND BALANCES AND I THINK THAT'S A DEFICIENCY I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO ADDRESS AND ONE THING THAT THE THE CHAIRMAN AND I SHARING COMMON ACTUALLY BUT ONE OF SEVERAL THINGS AND IS IT. WE BOTH HAVE IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS BACK HOME. PEOPLE ATTEMPTING -- TO SPLIT THE STATE. THAT THAT WHAT THEY HAVE BECOME THAT THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY AND NO BREAK THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME SO DISILLUSIONED WITH HOW THE REPRESENTATION STRUCTURE IS SET UP. THAT THEY WOULD RATHER SPLIT OFF AND FORM THEIR OWN STATE. THEN STAY PART OF CALIFORNIA. AND AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY REAL FRUSTRATION AND MANY NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT NOT JUSTIN IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEIR VOICE. AND IS GETTING HEARD. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY HERE WE HAVE OUR LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE. WAS ESSENTIALLY ESTABLISHED BY THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW SINCE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WE HAVE NOT CHANGED. I REPRESENTATION STRUCTURE ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE FORTY FORTY SENATORS EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT'S WHERE IT'S BEEN SET IN STONE SINCE THEN. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT JUST IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT. THAT WAS THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE WORKING MEN'S PARTY. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND ALSO BROUGHT US CHINESE EXCLUSION. AND WE ALSO THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON AND IN THAT CONTEXT THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WAS A VERY POSITIVE THING. AND YET WORSE WHERE WE'RE STILL USING THE SAME STRUCTURE THAT WE ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SO BOOK I THINK THAT THERE IS. A VERY MUCH AN ARGUMENT AND FOR US TO LOOK AT HOW WE MODERNIZE IT MAYBE THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO THAT -- BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT -- AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS AS PUBLIC PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW LOOK WE WE ARE THEIR VOICE. BUT EACH OF US REPRESENTS FORKNER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OUR SENATORS REPRESENT ALMOST A MILLION. RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF VOICES IN THERE [inaudible] THAT TIME. IT'S HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL VOICE IS AT LEAST GIVE IT THAT YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF SEAT AT THE TABLE SOME KIND OF VOICE AND LET ME JUST GIVE JUST SOME. AND IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME I KNOW. IS A YOU KNOW IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME AND MISTER CHAIRMAN YEAH. LIKE I CAN SAY THIS I KNOW THEM THERE HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE SOME QUESTIONS I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES JUST FROM FROM MY DISTRICT AND AS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW. FOR A LONG TIME UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE TIMBER AND MINING WERE VERY. STRONG INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IT PROVIDE A LOT OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. FOR PEOPLE IN MY AREA. BUT LARGELY BECAUSE OF POLICIES SUPPORTED BY URBAN AREAS YOU KNOW BOTH BOTH INCOMING FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE STATE LEVEL. BOTH THOSE INDUSTRIES SHUT DOWN LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN THOSE. SHUT DOWN WE HAVE SEVERAL GENERATIONS NOW. AND I'M IN SOME THESE COMMUNITIES THAT USED TO RELY ON THAT THAT. A OF DRUG ABUSE OF YOU KNOW PARENTS WHO LEFT THE SITUATION OF CHILDREN HAVE GROWN UP IN POVERTY. AND WITH NO OPPORTUNITIES YOU KNOW. AND LARGELY BECAUSE OF DECISIONS I GOT MADE BY SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE ELSE NOT BY PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE. NOT BY PEOPLE WHO WHO EXPERIENCE THAT. AND THAT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT THING -- FOR THAT REGION TO RECOVER FROM -- THE THINGS THAT WE DO HAVE AND WE TRIED. TO THE PLANT THERE IS IS ONE OF THEM IS MANUFACTURING IS WE'VE HAD A GROWING MANUFACTURING SECTOR ESPECIALLY IN OR THOUGH WHICH YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD A LOT OF ABOUT -- BUT THAT MANUFACTURING GROWTH HAS ACTUALLY BEEN HAMPERED. VERY MUCH SO BY SOME OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS POLICIES. NO MAY JUST. END UP I REALLY THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO DRIVE HOME. pWE HAVE PRETTY CLEAN AIR THE NORTH STATE. NO I THINK THERE'S ONLY ONE PART OF MY DISTRICT IT'S IN NON ATTAINMENT. AND THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE GETS LUMPED IN WITH SACRAMENTO -- AND THERE ARE QUALITY ISSUES AND SO THAT'S THE ONLY PART OF MY DISTRICT IT'S IN NON ATTAINMENT RIGHT NOW AND THEN A SENTIMENTALITY WOULD TELL YOU THE SAME THING [inaudible] AND YES SO. WE REALLY ACTUALLY NEED THE CARBON IF YOU WILL IN ORDER SUB SUPPORT OUR MANUFACTURING AND AND AND THE GROWTH THAT WE HAVE IN THERE. THE ONLY CARBON OUTPUT THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE IN THE NORTH STATE. THAT CREATES THAT THAT ACTUALLY CREATE SOME OF THE LARGEST CARBON OUTPUT IS OUR FORESTS BURNING EVERY YEAR. NEW CREATES MORE CARBON THAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT. AND WHAT WE'VE LONG ARGUED FOR BUT WE CAN'T GET. MOSTLY BECAUSE OF URBAN NEAR POLICIES PASSED BY OUT OF THE URBAN PARTS THE STATE WHO AGAIN. PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY LIVE THERE. DON'T HAVE AN INTERACTION WITH THE FORCE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF THE ISSUES THERE GET TO DECIDE. HOW THAT FORCED IS MANAGED AND IT'S LED TO THESE FORCE BECOMING TENDER BOXES THAT BURN EVERY YEAR? RIGHT NOW LAST WEEK AND BUTTE COUNTY WHERE SUPERVISOR LAMBERTUS FROM AN UNTAMED COUNTY WE'VE GOT FIRES MIA ONCE AGAIN. ALL THAT THAT'S WHERE THE CARBON OUTPUT HAS COME FROM THE MEANWHILE. I CAN'T OPEN UP A GLASS FACTORY IN -- ORVILLE WHICH ACTUALLY DID THEY WANTED TO COME IN. BECAUSE THE COST OF PAYING CREDITS -- WAS TOO GREAT FOR THIS COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK. AND YOU KNOW SO. LET ME DECIDE NOTHING TO AGRICULTURE VERY STRONG SECTOR IN MY IN MY AREA. WE HAD THE I GO OVER TIME BILL. TWO YEARS AGO ANY HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN OUR CULTURE INCLUDING MYSELF THAT SAID. APPLYING THE SAME OVERTIME RULES TO THIS INDUSTRY DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW WE WORK IN AGRICULTURE WE HAVE HARVESTED WE HAVE PLANNING TIME WHERE THERE'S VERY LONG HOURS. AND WE NEED TO GO LONGER HOURS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY OF OVER TIME NOT KICKING IN UNTIL. OF A LONGER SET OF OURS WE HAVE IN OUR OFF SEASON WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE EIGHT HOURS. YOU KNOW -- AND SO WE EXPLAIN THAT. RIGHT BUT LARGELY DUE TO YOU KNOW URBAN NEAR URBAN LEGISLATORS AGAIN. AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS IN A AM NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE ABOUT THIS BUT IT WAS. PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK IN THE INDUSTRY WHO DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE I HAVE NEVER WORKED ON A FARM. WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO RIGHT. AND IF THEN PERHAPS IF OUR REGION. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY REGION -- IN THE INLAND EMPIRE REGION A OF CALIFORNIA HAD MORE OF A VOICE MORE OF A SAY PERHAPS THERE WOULD MORE UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THOSE ISSUES. AND SO EARLIER THIS IS WHERE I YOU KNOW THIS IS WHERE I THINK LOOK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE ISSUE HERE THAT IS CAUSING PEOPLE. TO SAY LOOK WE WANT A LEAD WE ACTUALLY WANT TO PHYSICALLY LEAVE THE STATE. THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER YOU KNOW A NIGHT AND I THINK TO START HERE IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE WHERE WE HAVE SOME VERY. YOU KNOW SMART PEOPLE WHO THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES -- AND HERE'S MY PROPOSAL. YOU HERE'S MY DRAFT HERE'S MY TAKE ON IT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND AND START MAYBE MOVE IN A DIRECTION WE TRULY MODERNIZE. OUR REPRESENTATION AND GIVE ALL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA VOICE AND A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO HAVE. ONE WITNESS IN SUPPORT THAT YOU KNOW -- CHAIRMAN OF THE BUTTE COUNTY SEAT BOARD SUPERVISORS STEVEN EMBER FOR ABOUT A QUICKLY OR TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALL DAY YESTERDAY SOME OUTSIDE THE FENCE SO I KNOW. I'M JUST RECORD I JUST SAY NO I'M A FIT YOUR IS CALIFORNIAN LEGACY CALIFORNIA AND AYE PREACHES AUTOMATE MORES AND STOMACH I'M STILL FARMERS MCKENNA FARMAN BICU MODOC ANGLE AND PLUMAS COUNTY. ARE CALTRANS INFORMED BOTH MIGHT MY THING IS EVERY MOTHER'S REGIONS IS DIFFERENT RIGHT AT A FARM IN A DIFFERENT SET OF CRITERIA. I GUESS FOR ME IS IS WHY I DON'T AND JAMES BROUGHT UP AT THE URBAN A VOTE. SLOWLY SLOWLY DIE BECAUSE OF THAT JAMES SAID INDUSTRY'S GONE THERE'S OVER THERE. REAL QUICKLY IS. I I LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A AS A FAMILY RIGHT WE'RE ALL FAMILY AND AND WE WERE DIVERSE FAMILY. AND WE'RE ONLY GOOD AS OUR WEAKEST MEMBER IN THE FAMILY AND IF WE KEEP. PUTTING THIS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I IN THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT WATSON MIGHT AN AND IT'S SAD FOR ME TO WATCH. THEM TRY TO BALANCE BUDGETS TRY THE THINGS. ON MARIJUANA ON YOU KNOW TRY TO DO THE MATH ISSUE TENUOUS ISSUES YET YOU THAT THE STATE NEEDS WE NEED THE TAX BASE OF THE BAY AREA WE NEED TO OF OF ALLAH WE NEED THAT TAX BASE TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN TOLD AGAINST STATE OF JEFFERSON THAT THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO LYNCH ME SO BAD IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE'RE JUST BIGGEST COUNTY A POPULATION WISE THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THAT MOVEMENT -- IS UNSUSTAINABLE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I'VE SAID THAT OVER AND OVER OVER. AND I THINK A FRAGMENTED. STATE WOULD BE THE WORST THING EVER MAY LOOK A WEST VIRGINIAN I MEAN I DON'T WANNA BE THAT. YEAH THAT'S LASSEN TO DO IT AYE MY THING IS WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THE RURAL FOLKS AND UNLESS WE GET URBAN LEGISLATORS OUT TO SEE THE RURAL. A AND REALLY TRULY UNDERSTAND WE WERE DEALING WITH A WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE KIND OF A DRAG RIGHT WE HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THE WATER. WE'RE THAT DRAG ON OUR SOCIETY THE SENSE I MEAN IN THAT COLOR RESOURCE OF DONOR HOMELESS PROBLEM. BECAUSE WITH YOUR HOMELESS IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT IT'S PRETTY CHEAP LEVEL WE LIVE RIGHT SET WITH OTHER RESOURCE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT. SORT WE GIVE UP THAT WE GIVE UP MEAL FIRE DEPARTMENTS WE GIVE UP. THINGS WERE LUCKY IF YOU CAN BECAUSE WE'RE YOU KNOW HALF A BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE HAVE MONEY. BUT ALLOCATE AROUND US AREN'T. SO THAT WE COULD COME WITH US TO HELP THEM DO CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TRYING TO STOP. ALL THESE THINGS. THE RIPPLE EFFECT. SO WE'RE FOR FORTUNE IMPUTE BUT ALL KINDS RUN INTRODUCED YOU WATCHING TO DIE. I MEAN THEY'RE JUST OF A DYING AND AND AND I ALWAYS SAY THAT IN AGONY EVERYTHING ELSE. HE WOULD UNDERSTAND WE'VE GENERATIONS AWAY FROM RURAL YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN URBAN AREAS IT. NO WAY DOES ANY ORCHESTRA COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING TOWN NOW. YOU KNOW SO IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S AN ADVERSARIAL THING IS JUST. THEY UNDERSTAND IT'S NO DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN THE IN RURAL NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO LIVE IN URBAN AREAS YOU DON'T. THESE THINGS OUT HE JUST BILL THAT FENCE UP THERE JUST DO THIS DO WHAT I THERE'S ROOM RICH REASONABLE DUMPING INTO THE RIVERS. MEAN THERE'S THERE'S THINGS WE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT'S SO I THINK THAT THAT. UNTIL WE HAVE THAT KIND OF TO TAKE OF SOME SORT. AND JAMES DONE A GREAT JOB TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY TO DO THAT GIVE ATHLETES. WE'RE GONNA STRUGGLE THE STATE AND AND AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WE HAVE. SO MANY GREAT THINGS HERE I MEAN IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE PLACE AND I I WOULD HOPE THAT. SOME KIND OF MOVEMENT COMES THAT SO. THANK YOU LISA RESIDENT. NOT ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEN NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] SEEING NONE. BRING ABOUT A COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS COMMENTS SOMEONE REMOTE. THEY WERE SHARON AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE UP. FOR YOUR EFFORT -- I KNOW YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS AND IT PUT QUITE A BIT OF TIME -- INTO THIS SO -- I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH -- THE POLICY. AND THE DIRECTION YOU'RE GOING TO ASK YOU A COUPLE PRETTY OBVIOUS QUESTIONS THAT I'M. HOW SURE YOU EXPECT ARE COMING JUST -- THE CONSTITUTIONALITY A ANGLE HERE WITH EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE SAID AND YOU KNOW WHAT THIS UP YOU KNOW HOW THIS PROPOSAL. IS VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THEN ARE THERE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THIS KIND OF UPPER HOUSE. A REPRESENTATION NOW SPLIT INTO OF VARIOUS REGIONS SERVICES SAY HE CALIFORNIA UNIQUE -- APPROACH THAT YOU'RE TAKING. GREAT QUESTION I WAS EXPECTING THAT AND AND CERTAINLY -- SO AS AS YOU NOTE IN YOUR ANALYSIS AND THERE'S BEEN NO DOESN'T SPELL THIS OUT THE CONSTITUTION YOU KNOW THE U. S. CONSTITUTION ACTUALLY GIVE STATES THE ABILITY. TO SET THEIR OWN LEGISLATURE'S AND IT ALSO GUARANTEES. AN ARTICLE FOR A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT SMALL ARE THERE IS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO HIM -- BUT REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN A SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES -- AND GOVERNMENT NOW THAT LIKE WE HAVE CREATED WITH THE US GOVERNMENT SO. THE CASE LAW THAT'S AND BEEN INTERPRET OVERTIME AND PUBLIC THE THE THE LANDMARK CASE FOR OUR PURPOSES IS BAKER VERSES SR BAKER VERSUS CARR AND THEN -- REYNOLDS VERSUS SIMS SAID THAT STATE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS NEED TO BE A EQUAL IN POPULATION RIGHT. AND THEN YOU KNOW THE ONE PART ONE PERSON ONE RULE -- COUPLE THINGS [inaudible] A ONCE SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN CASE LAW THAT SAYS THAT THEY WILL ALLOW DEVIATIONS AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE'S OTHER WAS THE ARAB BROWN VERSUS THOMPSON CASE -- IN -- WYOMING WHERE BASICALLY THERE REDISTRICTING IN THERE SET UP WAS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY COUNTY HAD AT LEAST ONE REPRESENTATIVE AND SO THEY HAD STRUCTURED THEIR ASSEMBLY IN THIS CASE. SO THAT AT LEAST THAT COUNT THE MOST RURAL COUNTY WOULD HAVE ONE REPRESENTATIVE. AND I DID THROW THINGS OFF KNOWS MORE THAN THE 10% -- DEVIATION BUT THE COURT UPHELD IT AND SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME MOVEMENT TOWARD SAYING LOOK THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE REPRESENTATION -- WE WILL ALLOW SOME DEVIATIONS EVEN DEVIATIONS GREATER THAN. THAN 10% -- AN OUT AND OUT. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT LOOK -- JUST BECAUSE A OF SUPREME COURT HAS RULED THAT SOMETHING IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT COURT CAN'T SAME COURT CAN'T. EVOLVE AND CHANGE ITS MIND OVER TIME ABOUT. THE ISSUES OF REPRESENTATION NOW IN THOSE CASES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS ACTUALLY WRONG AS YOU KNOW JUSTICE WARREN -- AS WE KNOW JUST OF ONE WAS WRONG ABOUT LA THINGS INCLUDING JAPANESE INTERNMENT -- BUT IN HIS. IN HIS -- IN HIS OPINION HE SAID. LEGISLATORS DON'T REPRESENT. BOB GRABBED THE LEGISLATORS REPRESENT PEOPLE THEY DON'T REPRESENT ACRES IN TREES. I TAKE ISSUE WITH THAT. BECAUSE LET'S THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND -- I THINK VERY MUCH SO THAT WE REPRESENT. PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT TO YOU SOMEBODY. TAKE A VERY BIG THAT THAT SAY THEY REPRESENT A PLACE RIGHT YOU KNOW. NOT JUST THE PEOPLE AROUND THERE THAT IT LEAGUE THE TEN THAT PART BUT THEY REPRESENT THAT PLACE -- PEOPLE THAT REPRESENT THE GREAT PORT OF OF LONG BEACH RIGHT -- OUT ANY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL IT SAID TAKE PRIDE IN THE IN THE FACT THAT THAT IS THAT IS A PLACE THAT IT IS A PLACE OF GREAT INDUSTRY AND SOME -- AND AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THAT REGION YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE PEOPLE BUT IT'S THE INDUSTRY. RIGHT -- I THINK THAT -- WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE THE BAY YOU KNOW AND AND THE HEALTH OF THE DAY. RIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO PLACES NOT A SURLY PEOPLE -- BUT WE DEFINITELY ABOUT THAT AND FOR MY AREA THE ACRES OF FARMLAND THAT FEED PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR IMPORTANT AND THAT AND THE TREES I'M I'M GLAD THAT YOU ACTUALLY NO TREES IS INTERESTING BECAUSE LIKE I SAID TREES ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT. HOW WE MANAGE OUR FORCE IS IMPORTANT IT'S LEADING THE HUGE CARBON OUTPUT BECAUSE OF THESE FORCE FIRES. AND IT'S IT'S BEEN OF THE HAMPER TO THE ECONOMY OF THOSE NOR STATES NOT BEING ABLE TO DO RESPONSIBLE TIMBER HARVEST. AND IN THE NORTH STATE AND SO YET TREES ACTUALLY MATTERS QUITE A BIT ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND THE ACRES AND ACRES OF WATERSHED -- THAT I REPRESENT. IS PRETTY IMPORTANT TO THE ENTIRE STATE AND HOW THAT'S MANAGE IN AND WHAT AND AND HOW THAT GOES INTO SO YES PEOPLE DO REPRESENT ACRES ENTRIES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S AN YOU KNOW OUR AS WE KNOW OUR SUPREME COURT CAN INVOLVE. AND IT CAN AND ITS MIND CAN CHANGE ON DIFFERENT ISSUES I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THEM. THAT REPRESENTATION IS MORE THAN JUST ENSURING EQUAL POPULATIONS ANY TO EACH DISTRICTS LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER. QUICK EXAMPLE VERY QUICKLY IS COMPLETE VERY QUICK VERY QUICK THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER THE DRAWING OF YOUR MIND EVERYBODY DRAWING OF A MAJORITY. THE DRAWING OF MAJORITY MINORITY DISTRICTS HAS BEEN RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE SUPREME COURT. HOWEVER. THAT HASN'T STOPPED US FROM SAYING LOOK CAN WE FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT MINORITY COMMUNITIES ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY LEFT. PEOPLE OF THAT REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS IN THEIR DISTRICTS RIGHT THAT HASN'T STOPPED US FROM DOING THAT IT WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL WE FOUND WAYS TO STILL DRAW DISTRICTS. THAT HELP ENSURE THAT MINORITY COMMUNITIES THOSE MINORITY VOICES HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING HEARD. I THINK WE CAN DO THE SAME THING WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF SUPREME COURT. OF TRYING TO GIVE GREATER VOICE TO ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. LOOK AT I AT THERE ARE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THERE BUT THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THIS BODY SAID HEY YEAH I KNOW THE COURT SAID THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT WE'RE GONNA WORK TOWARD SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS A MORE JUST SYSTEM. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WHICH ARE STEINORTH AND YES I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR MEMBERS SUCH AS A CREATIVE -- YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY SO I GET ASKED I THINK WE ALL DO WHEN WE GO BACK TO OUR DISTRICTS ON A REGULAR BASIS WHAT'S IT LIKE IN SET LIKE IN SACRAMENTO THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO POLITICAL PARTIES. AND AYE I LIKE IN AND TRY TO POINT OUT THAT IT ISN'T REALLY ABOUT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH NORTHERN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WE HAVE THE URBAN AND THE COASTAL AND THAT WE HAVE THE INLAND. AND FRANKLY ALL OF US ARE AT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NEEDS OPERATE BASED ON THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND THE THE COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST THAT ARE WITHIN OUR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND SO -- I APPLAUD THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING A STAB AT TRYING TO BRING CHECKS AND BALANCES TO A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE NOT LOOKING COMPLETELY THAT. THE TYRANNY OF THE MAJORITY AND ALL ASPECTS OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MR HARBOR. THANKS VERY MUCH PA AND I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS YOU'RE BRINGING FORWARD I THINK YOU IDENTIFY -- RIGHTLY A INITIATIVE WAS HIT -- RIGHT ON THE HEAD BY ASSEMBLYMAN STEINORTH AND THAT'S THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL DISAFFECTED DIE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY FEEL. ODD THAT THE REGION'S THAT MAYBE RICH WITH POPULATION AYE SUCH AS THE BAY AREA OR LOS ANGELES. OUR GOVERNING THE STATEMENT HE HANDED WAY I THAT THAT DOESN'T WORK OFTEN RESPECT THE FREEDOMS FOR THE RIGHTS -- OF PEOPLE IN REGIONS THAT ARE -- OF DIFFERENT FOR PERSPECTIVE THAN THEM AYE. AND IN A SITUATION UP WERE IT JUST SIMPLY AS MAYBE NOT YIELDING TO A LOCAL CONTROL THEY CAN PERHAPS I'D BE MORE BENEFICIAL IN TERMS OF GOVERNING POP PARTICULAR AREAS I I DON'T AGREE WITH THE SOLUTION ALBEIT LAYING OFF ON THIS TODAY. ARE BUT I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND YOUR REASONS FOR BUT I WOULD NOTE -- THAT THOSE HAVE WHO ARE OBJECTING ON CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS JUST KEEP HIM BEHIND THAT USUALLY DOESN'T US THOUGHT THIS LEGISLATURE FROM PASSING BILLS -- WE JUST SAW THE US SUPREME COURT JUST YESTERDAY UP OVERTURNED I AB SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE VIA WHAT WAS CALLED THE FACT ACT WHICH WAS THE OF FORCED ABORTION REFERRAL. A LINE CORSA NOT WAS UNCLE PORTANTINO [inaudible] SARACENO -- I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY THE OBJECTION PEOPLE SHOULD THROW OUT A WHEN THEY VOTE FOR THINGS LIKE THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. THE MISTER GALLAGHER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I AND I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE I HOPE I I I REALLY HOPE PUT ASIDE THIS DOES IS YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THIS THIS LEGISLATION YOU KNOW THIS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TODAY. AND THEY IT'S BRASIDAS GUSHING ABOUT HEY HOW DO HOW DO WE MODERNIZE OUR REPRESENTATION -- YOU HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT TIME. A YOU KNOW THAT REALLY THAT ALL PARTS OF THE STATE I THINK YOU CAN IT WE CAN PROBABLY AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA'S SO BIG IN ITS FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. WE REALLY ARE LIKE A NO A SERIES OF STATES WITHIN A STATE YOU KNOW BUT WELL BUT ALL OF US TOGETHER ARE PART OF THE GREATNESS A CALIFORNIA RIGHT WERE PART OF WHAT MAKES A GREAT AND IT IN IT IF THAT'S TRUE. THEN HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS MORE OF A YOU KNOW THAT EACH PART EACH PART OF THE STATE WHICH YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE I THINK WE CAN ALL SAY LOOK THAN THAT. THESE DIFFERENT REGIONS THEY ARE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT ISSUES THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT -- HOW DO WE GIVE THEM MAYBE MORE OF AN EQUAL PLACE AT THE TABLE WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATION AND AGAIN I'M NOT ASKING THAT MY STE THAT MY REGION GET TO DOMINATE RIGHT? I MEAN THIS WOULD GIVE MY REGION AN EQUAL PLACE AT THE TABLE IN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY WOULD STAY THE SAME IS STILL BE BASED ON POPULATION NOPE NO LEGISLATION [inaudible] COULD PASS AND BE ENACTED INTO LAW WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE POPULOUS BODY. THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND WE WOULD JUST HAVE AN A A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE SET UP FOR THE OTHER HOUSE MEAN. SOME PEOPLE OFTEN ASK WHY DO WE HAVE TO HOUSES IF THEY'RE BOTH BASED ON POPULATION WHEN I JUST HAVE A UNICAMERAL. LEGISLATURE THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE'S A BIG STEP OF OUR PROCESS WE ALL WE ALL SCRAMBLING AROUND RIGHT NOW. GOING TO SEND THINGS BACK AND FORTH AND IN A LOT OF WAYS OUR JOB IS VERY SIMILAR WE REPRESENT BASED ON POPULATION. YOU KNOW I MEAN SO THERE'S ARGUMENTS ABOUT THAT BUT LET'S LET'S SPUR THAT DISCUSSION OF BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN DO BETTER THAN. A WHAT WE CAME UP WITH AN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS AND LET'S JUST KEEP. GOING ALONG THOSE LINES I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT AND AND I WOULD JUST ASK DOESN'T LOOK IT MAY REQUIRE. THE MEDICINE WITH THIS. IT MAY REQUIRE. URBAN AREAS TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP BACK SO THAT OTHER VOICES CAN BE HEARD. BUT IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING AND LET'S REMEMBER A LOT OF WHERE THE POPULATION BASE IS IN LOS ANGELES. THAT HAS BEEN MADE VIABLE BY. THE STATE WATER PROJECT RIGHT WHICH BRINGS WATER FROM THE NORTH DOWN TO THE SOUTH AND HAD THAT NOT BEEN THE CASE IT COULD NEVER SUPPORT THAT POPULATION HAD NOT ALL THE BOND PAIRS THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA PAID FOR THAT. THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE TODAY RIGHT SO WE ALL KIND OF DEPEND ON EACH OTHER. AND SINCE ALLOWED ECONOMIC GROWTH IS GONE TO THAT AREA LOT OF THE BENEFITS YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY THAT I WOULD SAY MY DISTRICT HAS MISSED OUT ON TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A STEP BACK SO THAT OTHER VOICES CAN BE HEARD SO OTHERS CAN HAVE AT LEAST AN EQUAL. PLACE AT THE TABLE IS SOMETHING TO BE THINKING ABOUT AND IF WE DON'T. MY FEAR IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THESE MOVEMENTS -- TO TO SPLIT THE STATE I MEAN WHY NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO WILL WHEN PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING HEARD -- THEY TEND TO SAY LOOK IT'S TIME FOR US TO YOU KNOW. GO OUR OWN SEPARATE WAY. NON AND MAYBE YOU KNOW MAYBE THOSE MOVEMENTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT BUT ELISE THIS WOULD HELP US TRY TO ADDRESS I THINK DOES VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU -- MISTER GALLAGHER AND YOUR YOUR DISTRICT AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND RURAL CALIFORNIA ARE LUCKY TO HAVE -- SOMEONE REPRESENTING THEM WITH YOUR PASSION AND YOUR INTELLIGENCE -- AND YOUR PERSEVERANCE -- I DON'T I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING -- WITH WHICH IS THAT WE ARE VERY DIVERSE DAY AND I REPRESENT SILICON VALLEY. OUT TO THE COAST -- AND SO I HAVE FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE AND I HAVE A GOAT GARY THAT I HONORED AS MODEL SMALL BUSINESS OF THE YEAR -- LAST WEEK -- AND SO. I'M CONSTANTLY TELLING MY CONSTITUENTS ARE AND AB ALSO HAD THE THE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF LIVING IN SOUTH DAKOTA -- FOR OVER YEAR -- BACK IN BETWEEN COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL -- IN AREAS THAT MAKE YOUR AREA LOOK URBAN -- WINNER SOUTH DAKOTA POPULATION -- THREE THOUSAND BEING THE BIGGEST CITY FOR A NINETY MILE RADIUS -- BUT THE FOLKS AND AND WINNER SOUTH DAKOTA DIDN'T [inaudible] BECAUSE THE FOLKS FROM THE URBAN AREAS OF SOUTH DAKOTA AND THEN THE FOLKS IN THE RURAL AREAS -- SHARED MORE IN TERMS OF THEIR IDEOLOGY ON ON CERTAIN ISSUES AND SO ON THE U. NO THEY THEY EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE THE SIMILAR ISSUES. THAT THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING TODAY THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT THE I THINK -- YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL BE MODERNIZING OUR OUR REPRESENTATION SYSTEM BUT BUT I THINK. TAKING A SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED NOTHING YOU SAID EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND MAKING IT LOOK LIKE A SYSTEM THAT WAS CREATED A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER -- IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTIES WITH TO THE WAY THE US SENATE SYSTEM IS SET UP ISN'T MODERNIZING ANYTHING -- IT'S ACTUALLY GOING BACK -- TO DECISION THAT WAS MADE BASED ON FACTORS THAT I THINK A LOT OF YOU KNOW OUR STAINS ON THIS COUNTRY -- THAT GUERRA WE DETERMINED THAT THE SENATE REPRESENTATION BASED UPON TO MOLLIFY STATES OF THAT HAD PRACTICES THAT WE NOW LOOK AT AS A WARRANT -- AND SO AYE I'M YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE REGIONS -- WE NEED THE PEOPLE ON THE URBAN AREAS TO GO OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS AND UNDERSTAND THE VALUE THAT'S BEING CREATED. WE ALSO NEED TO FIND WAYS. TO UP LEFT TO THE RIVER THAT OR THE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND AND GET GOOD MANUFACTURING JOBS AND GET YOU KNOW GOOD TECH JOBS -- AND AND FIND WAYS TO EXPAND THE ECONOMY THAT'S MADE CALIFORNIA SO STRONG -- TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA -- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THIS MEASURE -- IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT THAT I THINK THIS MEASURE DOESN'T ENSURE QUALITY I THINK IT ACTUALLY CREATES. A INEQUALITY IN REPRESENTATION -- THIS MEASURE DISCRIMINATES AGAINST SOME CAL POLITICAL REPRESENTATION -- GIVING OTHER CALIFORNIANS MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE VOTING POWER. IT'S EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION THAT THE US SUPREME COURT HAS MADE CLEAR IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND EVEN IF IN WARRANT UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND YES -- OF THE NEW MAKE UP OF THE CORD THAT WAS DETERMINED BY THE U. S. SENATE IN THEIR INTRANSIGENCE IN -- TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY DO THEIR JOB -- HAS CREATED A SITUATION WHERE -- MAYBE THIS WOULD BE DEEMED CONSTITUTIONAL BY THIS CURRENT SUPREME COURT WHO KNOWS I'M NOT INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT -- AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M UNABLE TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE -- AND RECOMMEND A NO VOTE BUT DEFINITELY DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION -- AND AND FINDING WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE. WELL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE REGIONS OF OUR REALLY DIVERSE STATE BECAUSE NOT MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE GOTTEN TIRED OF ME TELLING THEM THAT WHEN I WENT OUT TO VISIT -- MODESTO -- MODESTO REMINDED ME A LOT MORE SOUTH DAKOTA THAN IT DID SILICON VALLEY -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ALL OUR REGIONS -- ALL ART ARE CALIFORNIANS UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE REALLY BIG DIVERSE STATE AND THAT WE RESPECT OUR DIFFERENCES. ARE A AND AND WORKED.

ONE OF YOU ARE SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY NKING YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING -- DILIGENTLY WITH MY STAFF ON AMENDMENTS. I AND FOR THE RECORD I'LL BE TAKING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS -- ALSO MY STATEMENT WILL REFLECT A THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS I THINK IT IMPROVES THE BILL SO THANK YOU THANK YOU -- TODAY IN PRESENTING S. B.. TWENTY FIVE WHICH REVISES THE BALLOT ORDER -- MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ACTUALLY UP TO THE LEGISLATURE'S DISCRETION -- THE BALLOT ORDER -- SO THE PROPOSED BALLOT OR WOULD PUT LOCAL CITY SCHOOL. AND PROPOSITIONS FIRST FOLLOWED BY A COUNTY OFFICES FOLLOWED BY STATE AND THEN FOLLOWED BY FEDERAL WHICH TO ME MAKES SENSORS THE OLD ADAGE ALL. POLITICS ARE LOCAL PEOPLE -- HAVE AN IMMEDIATE AFFINITY FOR THEIR LOCAL ELECTED IN MANY OF US HAVE SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT THINK THIS IS A WELCOME ADDITION -- TO THE POLITICAL PROCESS THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL REQUIRE THE BILL TO BE A PILOT PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FROM JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THROUGH. DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND SUNSET AFTER THAT THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PERMIT LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SAME BALLOT ORDER AFTER. TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO AND LASTLY THE BILL REQUIRES A REPORT. TO BE SUBMITTED BY THE LA COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL. TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE EFFECT ON THE AFFECT OF THE NEW BALLOT ORDER WHICH IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT I KNOW TO THE CHAIR WANTED TO COLLECT THE DATA WHICH I THINK MAKES THIS A STRONGER BILL -- MEMBERS THE PROPOSED LAWS IN EFFORT TO BOOST TURNOUT IN LOCAL ELECTIONS WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE BY MOVING STAND ALONE ELECTIONS. TO CONSOLIDATE THE GOAL WAS TO TRY TO INCREASE LOCAL TURNOUT THE THE CONCERN THEM BROUGHT TO ME BY NUMEROUS CITY COUNCILS -- AND SCHOOL BOARDS AROUND LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHICH AS YOU KNOW I THINK THEY'RE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- WERE THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED THEY GET LOST IN A LONG BALLOT -- AND SO OUR MOVE MIGHT HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO TURN OUT SO THIS IS AN EFFORT WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO DOWN BALLOT TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT OR GOVERNOR THIS AN ATTEMPT. TWO OUT TO ADDRESS THAT THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY CITY CLERK OF ONE OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY FROM GLENDALE MY FRIEND ARTICLE SAKE AND SUGGESTED THE IDEA AS A CITY CLERK INSIDE HERE HAVE HIM HERE TO TESTIFY BEHALF THE BILL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MY NAME IS ART EXCITING AND I AM THE ELECTED -- CITY CLERK OF GLENDALE CALIFORNIA IS MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS MORNING -- THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU SENATOR I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON S. B. TWENTY FIVE AS YOU CONSIDER IT IN THE FUTURE OF LOCAL ELECTIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO GIVE A SPECIAL THANKS TO SENATOR ANTHONY PORTANTINO WHO LENT A WILLING EAR TO THE CONCERNS OF MANY LOCAL RESIDENTS CONSTITUENTS AND OFFICIALS IN THE WAKE OF THE PASSAGE ADOPTION. OF LAWS THAT HAVE CHANGED THE WAY LOCAL CITIES AND JURISDICTIONS CONDUCT THEIR ELECTION. TODAY I'M SPEAKING TO YOU AS THE CITY CLERK WHO HAS NOT. LOCALLY -- FOR STATE OFFICE AND HAS WORKED VOLUNTEERED AND ADVISED ON CAMPAIGNS ELECTIONS AND GRASSROOTS VOTER OUTREACH PROGRAMS. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE WHEN THE STATE'S VOTERS RIGHTS PARTICIPATION ACT WAS ADOPTED AND SIGNED INTO LAW IT PROMPTED MANY CITIES. AND WHICH HAD THEIR OWN STANDALONE ELECTIONS TO CONSOLIDATE WOULD STATEWIDE ELECTION DATE. IN GLENDALE WHAT THAT MEANT WAS THAT OUR TRADITIONAL DATE OF APRIL ELECTIONS HELD BIENNIALLY IN ODD NUMBERED YEARS HAVE NOW MOVED TO COINCIDE WITH EVEN NUMBERED STATEWIDE ELECTIONS. WHICH INCLUDE PARTISAN OFFICES AND MANY OTHER OFFICES INCLUDING JUDICIAL SEATS AND STATE PROPOSITIONS. THE INTENT OF THE BILL WAS TO HAVE LOCAL ELECTIONS WITH RELATIVELY LOW VOTER TURNOUT COINCIDE WITH ELECTIONS APPRECIATE A MUCH HIGHER TURNOUT. BUT TURNOUT ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF DATES DURING STATE AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS A LOT OF FUNDS. ARE SPENT BY ORGANIZATIONS PARTIES AND CANDIDATES RUNNING ON PARTISAN ISSUES. AND TICKETS TO REACH VOTERS. AND RIGHTFULLY SO SINCE THIS IS A DATUM OF OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BUT FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WHO HAS NEVER RUN FOR ANY OFFICE. LOCAL OFFICES AS MANY OF YOU KNOW SINCE THAT IS WHERE THE BACKGROUND OF MANY PEOPLE WHO RUN FOR HIGHER OFFICE COMES FROM ITS CITY COUNCIL SCHOOL BOARD OR OTHERWISE. THIS IS THEIR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO RUNNING FOR OFFICE. LOCAL ELECTIONS TEND TO BE FOR THE MOST PART NONPARTISAN AND OFTEN THESE CANDIDATES ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE FOR FUNDS. WHEN THERE ARE BIGGER RACES GOING ON? EVERYONE I'M SURE HAS HEARD AND IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM DONOR FATIGUE IN THIS ROOM. NOW PICTURE THE IMPACT ON THIS ON LOCAL CANDIDATES AS THEY TRY TO CUT THROUGH THE NOISE OF MAILERS AND OTHER CHALLENGES AS A RUN FOR THEIR LOCAL OFFICES TO BETTER THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND PARTISAN ELECTION CYCLES. TO GET THEIR MESSAGE OUT TO THE VOTERS. WE ARE ASKING YOU TO CHANGE THINGS BACK TO THE WORD THE WAY THEY WERE BUT MERELY ASKING YOU TO CONSIDER SIMPLE COMMON SENSE BILL THAT WOULD REVERSE THE ORDER OF THE BALLOT. AND MOVIES OFTEN FORGOTTEN RACES RELEGATED TO THE BALLOT BOTTOM OF THE BALLOT BOOK TO THE FRONT OF THE BOOK WHERE THEY WILL DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE VOTERS. WHO GO TO VOTE? IN A RESEARCH STUDY CONDUCTED BY PROFESSORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AND PUBLISHED BY THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS IT WAS CITED THAT LOWEST LEVELS OF ROLE OFFICE. AS WOULD LOS LEVEL OF RELAPSE WAS 11% OF VOTERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN TOP OF THE TICKET ELECTIONS AND FAILED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DOWN TICKET RACES. AND IT'S IS AS HIGH AS 21% THAT WAS BASED ON PARTISAN AFFILIATION. RESULTS SUGGEST SEVERAL PHENOMENON MAY BE INFLUENCING VOTER PARTICIPATION WHEN THEY GO TO THE POLLS. ROLOFF MAKER BECAUSE VOTERS MAY BECOME FATIGUED WE'VE OFTEN HEARD OF VOTER AND ELECTION. OF FATIGUE. BY THE TIME THEY REACH A JUICY JUDICIAL RACES THEY MAY HAVE VOTED IN SO MANY OFFICES ALREADY THAT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT BE BOTHERED TO INVEST MORE TIME IN THE PROCESS. AND MOST LOCAL RACES ARE NOW FOLLOW THE JUDICIAL RACES. SECOND ROLL OFF MAY STEM FROM IGNORANCE VOTERS MAY REACH DOWN TICKET RACISM WHICH THEY KNOW LITTLE IF ANYTHING ABOUT THE CANDIDATES AND CHOOSE NOT TO VOTE BECAUSE THEY LACK ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DO SO. THIRD AUTHORED OF ALL ROLOFF MAKER BY ACCIDENT AND IT MAY BE THAT SOME VOTERS USE A STRAIGHT TICKET VOTING OPTION AND DO NOT REALIZE THAT IN DOING SO THEY HAVE SKIPPED THE NONPARTISAN OFFICES WHICH IS WHAT MOST LOCAL OFFICES ARE. HOW THE STATE STRUCTURE THAT'S ELECTIONS IN BALLOTS CAN IMPACT WHICH OF THESE PROCESSES IF ANY MAY BE AFFECTING VOTERS THIS IS WHAT SB? TWENTY FIVE WILL HELP US STUDY AND HOPEFULLY REALIZE WHAT JERRY WAS WHILE THE GOAL OF THE RESEARCH IS NOT TO SETTLE THIS DEBATE OVER ADOPTING A CERTAIN TYPE OF ELECTION ARE BALLOT. THE RESULTS WILL CLEARLY SHOW THAT THAT THIS IS WITH THESE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE CLEARLY -- IMPACTS AND CONSIDERABLE CONSEQUENCES OF HOW WE DESIGN OR BALLOTS ELECTION SYSTEMS I BELIEVE THAT ANY PERCEIVED CHALLENGES CAN BE ADDRESSED BY THE MODERNIZATION EFFORTS TO THE VOTING SYSTEMS. THAT THE LA COUNTY REGISTRAR IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON TO THE V. SAP PROJECT AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO ALLOW LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ANY OTHER COUNTIES WILLING TO SEEK THIS OPTION TO RECONFIGURE THEIR BALLOT ORDER. TO MAKE THOSE LOCAL OFFICES BEFORE ALL OTHER OFFICES ON THE BALLOT ALONG WITH THE SENATOR I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE OF SUPPORT PRESS BE. TWENTY FIVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO IMPROVE OUR ELECTION SYSTEM AND DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES THANK YOU MISTER I CAN'T. BUY ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CARE ROTH ON BEHALF OF THE CITY'S A PASADENA AND BURBANK BOTH IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KURT BLACKBURN OF ELSA WILSON ADVOCACY HERE ON BEHALF THE CITY OF LOCKING OUT OF FLINTRIDGE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PLUG INS OFFICE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF SIRI DOSE NORWALK SIGNAL HILL AND THOUSAND OAKS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD MORNING I RYAN RUN GO BY CO CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATION COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COURSE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WERE NOT IN OPPOSITION. JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT WERE TWEETERS HERE WHERE I JUST BRINGING UP SOME CONCERNS. I VERY -- THANKFUL TO CENTER PORTANTINO TO ADDRESS OUR FOR DRESSING THE ISSUE OF BALLOT DROP OFF AND I ENCOURAGED TO HEAR ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN. BY TO MAKE THIS A PILOT -- WELL WE'RE NOT OPPOSING THE BILL AYE WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL FIRST OFFICE FLEXIBILITY. BY DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AT LEAST A FROM WHAT I HEARD IN THIS DISCUSSION I'D THAT ASIDE THE ISSUE OF FLEXIBILITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. UNDER CURRENT LAW ELECTIONS OFFICIALS HAVE SOME LIMITED FLEXIBILITY WITH MOVING SOME CANDIDATES AROUND OR AND SOME RACES AROUND. AT THAT FLEXIBILITY SAVES MONEY BY GIVING US THE ABILITY -- TO I REDUCE THE NUMBER BALLOT CARDS I MIGHT BE USED IN AN ELECTION. ADD IF I EXPAND THEIR IS -- A SIMILAR CONSIDERATION OF BURKE THERE'S I'VE WE DON'T SEE ANY SUMMER CONSIDERATION OF FLEXIBILITY IN THIS PROPOSAL. I SECONDLY BALLOT HEADERS ARE CONTEST HEADERS AT THIS PROPOSAL CREATE SOME NEW FAQ CONTESTS HEADERS THAT WE NOW NEED TO ADDRESS. AND ANYTIME THAT WE REMOVE A REALISTIC FROM THAT BALLOT WE HAVE A CONCERN ALSO ESPECIALLY GIVENTHE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY ON MOVING CONTESTS AROUND. I'D THAT THAT COULD CREATE A SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE MORE ROOM TAKEN UP BY. THE HEADERS AND NO FLEXIBILITY SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT POSSIBLY ADDRESS AND THEN THIRDLY OUTREACH A SOMEONE'S GOING TO HAVE TO HELP EDUCATE THE VOTERS ABOUT THIS CHANGE. AYE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OBVIOUSLY. A THE AUTHOR HAS TOLD US THAT THE COMMITTEE ARE COMMITTEE THAT HE INTENDS TO ADDRESS EDUCATION. BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT IN THE CURRENT VERSION THE BILL DIDN'T HEAR IT MENTIONED. IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE JUST DISCUSSED FOR THAT BURDENS GOING TO FALL ON SOMEBODY AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO FALL ON THE LOCAL ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. A IT SO THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONCERN ADDRESSED AS WELL I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPOND YEAH AND ONE SECONDS BY THE ANSWER HINES YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR A CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE DELEGATE IS THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT I'M SORRY I'M LATE I WAS RUNNING FROM ANOTHER COMMITTEE -- WE WE SUPPORT THE EFFORT TO ING INCREASE -- VOTERS IN OUR ELECTIONS AND TO ADDRESS THE DROP OFF IS SPECIAL DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW WE'RE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLOT. BY THE TIME VOTE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE DROP OFF A A LOT OF OUR ELECTIONS ARE GONNA WILL ONLY HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE VOTING IN THE AFFECTED WERE FOR GOD MATTER DROPS UP SO MUCH THAT HAVE WHEN THIS BILL WAS IT ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED. WE WEREN'T EVEN IN IT -- HOWEVER AFTER THE AMENDMENTS WE WERE PUT BACK INTO WHERE WHERE HIGHER UP WHERE THE SECOND SECTION. AYE WE BELIEVE THIS WILL INCREASE TO A VOTER TURNOUT IN OUR LOCAL ELECTIONS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND THEN BRING BACK TO COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT CENTER IF YOU LIKE DID. THEY GET COULD HAVE HIDING IDA I WOULD LIKE JUST BOND INSTEAD OF WE ALL KNOW THAT. A PUNCH CARD. IT HAS NUMBERS FROM ONE TO WHATEVER [inaudible] THOUSAND IT'S LIKE PUNCH CARD EVERY SINGLE ELECTION. A DIFFERENT VALUE GETS ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT BUBBLE I GUESS IN SOME RACES YOU MIGHT HAVE A CONTESTED. ASSEMBLY PRIMARY THERE MIGHT BE FIFTEEN CANDIDATES SO IN THAT PARTICULAR RACE FROM. ONE TO FIFTEEN IS A SUPPLY IS ASSIGNED TO ON AND ELECTION SO WITHIN EVERY ELECTION AND THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES CHANGES SO THE COMPUTER ASSIGNS A DIFFERENT VALUE TO EACH BUBBLES SO. FAR AS THERE BEING ANY SORT OF INCREASED COST TO DO THAT. THAT'S HAPPENS FROM ELECTION ELECTIONS WHETHER THIS BILL BECOMES LAW WHETHER IT DOESN'T. BUBBLE ASSIGNED FOR THE COMPUTER SCIENCE VALUES TO BUBBLES THAT'S ONE NUMBER TWO AS THE STATE MANDATED THIS CHANGE THOSE BALLOTS IN THOSE HATTERS HAVE TO CHANGE ANYWAY. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE HEAD OF THAT CHANGE LET'S? DO THIS AT THE SAME TIME SO WE THINK THAT'S A PRAGMATIC -- THING TO DO THE OTHER PIECES HARD EDUCATION YES WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN AS PART OF A BUT THAT'S ALSO WHERE. THE CITIES THAT COMMENT IF YOU NOTICE MOST OF THE CITIES IN LA COUNTY AS WELL AS THE LEAGUE OF CITIES THE CALIFORNIA CONTRACT CITIES ASSOCIATION. ALL OF THE ADVOCACY GROUPS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ALL PART AND PARCEL TO THE SUPPORT OF THIS AND ARE GOING TO BE DOING THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE THEIR VOTERS AS WELL SO. THIS IS A TRUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO I AM I THINK WE WE HAVE ADDRESSED THE THIS FARCE THE FLEXIBILITY ISSUE I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY LANGUAGE ON THAT -- BUT I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT IF THERE'S AYE IN AGAIN WITH THE WE ON THIS SUGGESTION ON PRUDENT FLEXIBILITY FOR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS I'M I'M OKAY WITH THAT BUT THE BASIC CONCEPT IS. LET'S USE THE STATE LAW. THAT IS INTENDED. TO CREATE A HIGHER TURNOUT TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT WE HAVE A HIGHER TURNOUT PROBABLY ON THESE LOCAL ELECTIONS THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES AND QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS VICE YOUR HARPER WHY [inaudible] WELL IF YOU'RE RUNNING FOR LOCAL OFFICE IN A CYCLE WHERE THERE HIGHER OFFICES THAT ARE ALSO ON THE BALLOT -- AND OBVIOUSLY THERE IS REQUIRES FUNDS TO RUN FOR OFFICE A LEASE FOR MOST OF THE OFFICES -- THAT WHETHER IT'S THE CITY COUNCIL SCHOOL BOARD. TO GO TO THE TO DRAW FROM THE SAME POOL TO GO TO TO CUT THROUGH THE NOISE -- TO SEND OUT MAILERS -- TO PRINT OUT LAWN SIGNS -- IF THEY'RE ALSO INDIVIDUALS RUNNING. FOR ASSEMBLY CONGRESS SENATE WELL ETCETERA A IT SOMETIMES BECOMES DIFFICULT FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS RUNNING FOR LOCAL OFFICES TO DRAW FROM THOSE SAMPLES OF SUPPORT -- SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE WILLING TO DONATE TO THE LOWER TICKET RACES. IT IS THE IT IS THE POINT THEREIN THAT THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH MONEY IN LOCAL POLITICS. NO I I I I THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY IS WHEN YOU MOVE FROM A STAND ALONE ELECTION WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW. THE POLITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER THAT'S THE ATTENTION OF THE VOTER WHEN YOU MOVE FROM A STANDALONE ELECTION WHERE YOU'RE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN. TO A BALLOT WHERE THERE'S EVERY SINGLE THING UNDER THE SUN. THERE'S NO VOICE. AND THE LO THE THE LOCAL VOICE WHICH IS MAYBE BE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. MAY BE A SCHOOL BOND. OR A THE INITIATIVE WHATEVER THAT IS THAT LOCAL EFFORT IS GOING [inaudible] TO PETE. WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL THE GUBERNATORIAL. STATEWIDE SO ALL OF THOSE OTHER THINGS AND THAT NO WAYS SOMETIMES WILL DROWN OUT THE THE LOCAL EFFORTS I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE POINT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER LET ME PUT IT DIFFERENTLY -- MAKE SURE BUT LET ME JUST SAY THAT -- SO I FLEW UP HERE THIS MORNING ON SOUTHWEST I WISH I COULD HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME F. FROM THE LAST TWO GENERAL ELECTION CYCLES THE VOLUME OF MILLER'S I'VE RECEIVED FROM CANDIDATES RUNNING. FOR OFFICE IS HIGHER THAN LOCAL OFFICE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH I CAN CARRY AND I DIDN'T WANT TO BURDEN MYSELF IN BRINGING THAT AMOUNT OF MAIL WITH ME TO BRING IT TO YOU. TO SHOW YOU WHAT INDIVIDUALS RUNNING FOR OTHER ON THE SHOULD HAVES AND FOR EVERY OTHER OFFICE. NOW FOR LOCAL OFFICE NOT ONLY IS IT DIFFICULT TO JUST RAISE MONEY IF YOU'RE A NOVICE TO THE PROCESS. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT -- YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MAILERS ARE SEEN IN AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED ANNA AND ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S ALREADY ALTHOUGH OTHER INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE THAT'S COMPETING FOR THE EYES AND EARS AND ATTENTION OF THE VOTERS. THANK YOU FOR POINT I THE NEXT ONES OF FOR THE AUTHOR. I'M TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT EXACTLY THAT YOU'RE IDENTIFYING AS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I HEARD TERMS LIKE VOTER TURNOUT. UP BUT THEN FROM THE WITNESS AYE WE HEARD. ABOUT ROLL OFF A ABOUT PEOPLE VOTING IN. A FEDERAL OFFICES BUT MAYBE NOT A REACHING LOCAL OFFICES ONCE THEY GET THAT DOWN THE BALLOT SO IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IS IT THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS CAST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I USUALLY UNDERSTAND TO MEAN? BY VOTER TURNOUT OR IS IT. TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF VOTES THAT ARE MADE FOR LOCAL OFFICE GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS WHAT'S THAT. TO DETERMINE SUCCESS WHAT IS THE NUMERATOR AND WHAT IS THE DID A DENOMINATOR IS IT IS IT BALLOTS CAST I IS IT I THE PERCENTAGE THAT YOU HAVE THAT HER. I THINK THE MORE DIRECT HERMES UNDERVOTES. ARE THAT THERE ARE FOR LOCAL OFFICE VERSUS BALLOT CAST OR IS IT UNDERVOTES OBVERSES TOTAL VOTING AGE ELIGIBLE POPULATION. PLEASE HELP ME IDENTIFY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM IT'S HARD UNDERVOTES THAT IS THE PROBLEM AND AND THE THEORY IS THIS. PEOPLE WILL GO JUST LIKE WE KNOW IN A GENERAL ELECTION MORE PEOPLE SHOW UP IN A GENERAL ELECTION BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT OR THEY'RE OUT TO VOTE FOR THE GOVERNOR. THE NAY VOTE IN A PRIMARY -- MANY PEOPLE GO IN AND THEY JUST VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CAN'T CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE AND THEY GO HOME THEY DON'T GO DOWN BALLOT. SO THE THEORY IS THIS. PEOPLE SINCE WE'RE CONSOLIDATING THE ELECTION WE BELIEVE AS WELL AS MOST OF THE COUNTIES IN OR TO BE CITIES AN ALLEY COUNTIES THEY BELIEVE COLLECTIVELY THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WILL NOT GO DOWN BALLOT AND VOTE FOR EVERY SINGLE. ELECTION ON THAT BALLOT BECAUSE THEY'LL STOP AFTER THE HIGH PROFILE ELECTIONS SO WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT UNDERVOTES. AND THAT CONTRADICTS THE THEORY OF CONSOLIDATING THE ELECTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THE GOAL WAS TO INCREASE TURNOUT ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. CONVERSELY WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN PEOPLE OPEN UP THEIR BOOK AND THEY SEE THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL BORDER THEIR LOCAL MAYOR THEIR LOCAL. SCHOOL PARCEL TAX WHATEVER IT IS. THEY'LL DO THE LOCAL RACES AND THEY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO GO DOWN TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENT THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO THERE NOT GOING TO VOTE ON THE LOCAL ELECTION AND GO HOME. THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO THEY GET TO THE HIGH PROFILE ACTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT IS GOING TO BE THEIR BEHAVIOR WE THINK THAT SERVES DEMOCRACY IN THE CITIES AND WE ALSO BELIEVE IT SERVES DEMOCRACY FOR THE FOR THE STATE AND AND FEDERAL LAW ELECTIONS AS WELL. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE GONNA DO A LOT A CITY SECTION. I COUNTY SECTION. STATE SECTION AND A FEDERAL SECTION IT ACTUALLY FOLLOWS A A LOGICAL ORDERLY PROGRESSION OF THOUGHTS. AND WE THINK THAT MATCHES THE VOTERS. MENTALITY AS WELL THE GONNA THINK LOCAL THAN THE GONNA GO COUNTY. STATE AND FEDERAL. YEAH IF I COULD ASK TO CLARIFY I WITH THE AMENDMENTS AS A PILOT PROJECT. WHAT WHAT IS THE TIMEFRAME THAT WE HAVE HERE IS IT THAT THE BALLOT ORDER IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS GOING TO FLIP OVER FLIP BACK IN LESS AYE? FURTHER LEGISLATION IS THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE DATA FROM BOTH A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEN AN OFF YEAR ELECTION SO THERE WOULD BE TWO CYCLES. SO WE WOULD GET THE DATA FROM TWO CYCLES. A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THEN A GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION WE THINK THAT'S A PRUDENT. STEP AND THEN FRANKLY WE'RE TRYING TO EMPOWER THE LOCAL SO IF THE COUNTY REGISTRAR LIKES THIS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE SOMETHING THEY LIKE. BUT IF THEY DECIDE THEY DON'T LIKE IT. IT WOULD SUNSET AND I WOULD GO BACK WOULD REVERT BACK. SO WE THINK IT GIVES THE DATA THAT. EVERYBODY WANTS WE THINK IT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT WE THINK EXISTS AND WE THINK THAT'S A PROPER COMMONSENSE CONCLUSIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IF I IF I MAY MENTION. LA I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION ON THAT WAS MADE -- THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE OF COURSE ARE SWITCHING ELECTION ORDERS AND THEN POTENTIALLY SWITCHING BACK I THINK THAT COULD LEAD. TO AYE A GREATER DEGREE OF A OF VOTER CONFUSION -- ESPECIALLY THE TIME WHEN IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AYE WE JUST HAD A SITUATION WHERE I THINK WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE -- WERE LEFT OFF THE VOTER ROLLS OR WE'RE HAVING CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE SO I'M NOT SURE IF LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- IS THE RIGHT LOCATION OUGHT TO DO THIS IF IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO DO A HIM ON A PILOT PROJECT. I WOULD COUNTER UP PROPOSE A THAT I THINK THAT THE ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT UP ARE VALID POINTS. I THAT THERE ARE IS A LOT OF NOISE AND IT'S VERY HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE YOUR RACE -- WIN NOW THERE'S ALL THESE FEDERAL AND STATE RACES THEY'RE GOING ON IVERSON'S LOCAL ELECTIONS AND SO I THINK THAT -- A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT IS FAR SIMPLER AND NOT SIMPLY BY REPEALING AYE S. B. FOUR ONE FIVE FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT FORCES LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BY TWO I HAVE THESE ELECTIONS AND INSTEAD ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE FREESTANDING ELECTIONS AND THAT WAY I THINK THAT YOU'LL GET WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR WHICH IS TO HAVE OUR FEWER UNDERVOTES. UP MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE TURNING OUT TO PARTICIPATE ARE PARTICIPATING IN ALL THE ELECTIONS ON THE BALLOT. AND WERE AVOIDING VIA THE NOISE SITUATION WHERE I'M MAILERS MAYBE DISTRACTING OR OTHER FACTORS MAY BE DISTRACTING AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD SOLVE THE ISSUE. I AM PERHAPS OF BRINGING FORWARD IN THE IN THE NEXT -- SESSION I WOULD BE AN OUTSTANDING IDEA -- I JUST THINK THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT SOLUTION. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MULLIN. THANK ASSURE THANK YOU SENATOR A VERY INTRIGUED BY THEIR SAY WILL CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE PILOT TO SEE WHAT THAT DOES IN TERMS OF HOW BALLOT DROP OFF WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE I KNOW THAT LOS ANGELES WILL AT SOME POINT I HOPE -- BE. OPTING AND ON THE VOTERS CHOICE ACTON GOING TO ALL VOTE BY MAIL. SO THE COMBINATION OF GOING TO ALBANY BY MAIL WHICH IS HAVING SIGNIFICANT I IMPACT ON TURNOUT. LAW AND SWITCHING THIS BALLAD ORDER YOU MAY REALLY SEE I IMPROVE PARTICIPATION IN THE LOCAL. OUR OFFICES WHO A LOT HAPPENING HERE -- I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE PILOT -- A MY ONE QUESTION WELL WHAT MY ONE RESERVATION I GUESS WOULD BE AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE DOING A PILOT IN ITS EXPERIMENTAL IS YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE VOTERS ARE SKIPPING OVER. THE LOCAL TO THE HIGHER PROFILE RACES AND NOT RETURNING. OUGHT TO TO THE DEL MAR LOCALIZED RACES BUT WILL LEARN THAT ARE IN THE PILOT WHEN YOU COMPARE TYPICALLY VS ELECTION CYCLES SO I AM VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS I WILL SUPPORT IT IF IT DOESN'T HAVE A MOTION ALL MOVE IT. ONE QUESTION NO. DOES THE DECEIT ULTIMATE DECISION IN THE COUNTY RIVER TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO CONTINUE THE PILOT OR IS THAT JUST A DECISION ARE TO BE MADE BY THE LOCAL REGISTRAR. I WAS ANTICIPATING THE REGISTRAR -- BECAUSE THEY ARE THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICIAL -- AND THAT WAY IT'S NOT PART OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS BUT IF YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA. YOU KNOW. I JUST THINK THAT'S THE PERSON WHO'S ENTRUSTED WITH MAKING THE DECISION -- I'M FINE WITH THAT I'M FINE WITH THAT'S MY THUMB I JUST WAS CURIOUS IF IT WAS CALLED OUT OF THE BILL SO MAYBE TO AN AWKWARD IF YOU DID NOT SEE THAT AMENDMENT SO -- WE CAN CLARIFY THAT TO ME. THAT'S MY THINKING THAT THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICIAL. THE WHO'S GONNA HAVE THE MOST IMMEDIATE. UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER THIS WAS SUCCESSFUL OR NOT AND THEN IT WOULDN'T BE POLITICAL THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION. IN THEM MY ONLY COMMENT THERE WOULD BE IF YOU CAN CONFER WITH THE LOGAN ABOUT THAT AND AND THE CLERKS. TICKET FOR THAT THAT'S THEIR CHOSEN APPROACH -- BUT WITHOUT ALMOST THE BILL WOULD IT'S REALLY MOTION THE SECOND. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

PIE THEY ARE FANTASTIC BICU TO WORK WITH THANK YOU SO MUCH I A STRONG DEMOCRACY AT THE BEGIN ALL AGREE DEPENDS ON A VOTERS BELIEF THAT THERE BALLOT COUNTS. HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS HAD THEIR WORLD ROCKED AYE WHEN THEY'RE BALLOT WAS THROWN AWAY NOT COUNTED IN THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. BECAUSE OF IN THIS MATCHING SIGNATURE. HOW CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY ALLOWS EIGHT DAYS TO CORRECT A BALLOT WITHOUT A SIGNATURE THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT IT COUNTY GIVES A VOTER AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT IN THIS FASHION SIGNATURE? IN FACT THAT HE SAID TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THEIR BALLOTS TOSSED IN NOT COUNTED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOTIFIED OF A DISCREPANCY IN THEIR SIGNATURE. S. B. SEVEN FIFTY NINE CREATES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL LUCK AND ELECTION OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY VOTERS WHEN THEY'RE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS INJURE MISMATCHES THE ONE ON FILE. IT ALSO GUARANTEES THOSE VOTERS INOPPORTUNE TO CORRECT THAT MISMATCH SAID THEIR VOTES CAN BE COUNTED. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY CANDIDLY A BALLOT HAS IMAGE MADNESS MATT SIGNATURE IT COULD BE BECAUSE A PERSON HAS A DISABILITY. UPPER SIX SIGNATURE MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. AS SOMEONE MISUNDERSTOOD IN SIGNED IN NON ENGLISH CHARACTERS OR DIFFERENT MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD SUCH AS A SPOUSE OR CARETAKER. SIGN THE BALLOT ON THEIR BEHALF. IN ITS RECENT HEADLINES HAVE SHOWN EVEN ONE VOTE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE VIRGINIA HOUSE RACE IS A PRIME EXAMPLE. AS THE HOUSE AS THE USE OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA WE CANNOT IGNORE THIS ISSUE ANY LONGER. IN TODAY OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIANS VOTE BY MAIL A IN SOME COUNTS CONDUCT ENTIRE ELECTIONS BY MAIL. THE MOST RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS REFLECT OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE REGISTRARS AND ONCE A THANK YOU FOR THAT WORK. THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND ONCE HE THANK YOU TO THE SECTOR STATE HIS TEAM OP FURTHER LEADERSHIP AND OF COURSE THE ACLU UP FOR THEIR AYE TRAILBLAZING LEADERSHIP. IN THE STATE ON THIS ISSUE. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO NOTIFY VOTERS OF MISMATCHING CINCTURE. IT THE SAY DAYS PRIOR TO CERTIFICATION OF AN ELECTION A GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A TO VERIFY THAT SIGNATURE. THE VOTER RETURN TO SINK A VERIFICATION A STATEMENT KNOW MAY LATER THAN FIVE PM TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE CERTIFICATION OF THE ELECTION.

IF YOU MOCK ME HAVE FOR SECRETARY STATE EXPEDIA WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS BILL GONNA THINK OF THE STAFF SUPPORTERS AND FUTURE SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO CRAFTING A BILL WHICH IS OPERATIONALLY POSSIBLE AND MEETS THE THRESHOLD OF OUR KEY SUPPORTERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MANGUM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT WE WITNESS THE PROBLEM WHEN. BALLOTS ARE DISREGARD FOR SIGNATURE MISMATCHES AND OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS LATINO VOTERS AND VOTERS BORN OUTSIDE THE U. S. WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISENFRANCHISED BY IS PERCEIVED SIGNATURE MISMATCHES. AND BRING IN OUR LAWSUIT WE RECEIVED A FAVORABLE COURT DECISION AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL IS A GREAT EFFORT AND CODIFYING THAT COURT DECISION TO ENSURE THERE'S CONSISTENT APPLICATION. STATEWIDE AND VOTERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CARE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IPHONE. THINK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY THAT AWARENESS IS IN SUPPORT. ANDREAS FISCHER WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING HIM BACK TO COLLEGE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION. VICE CHAIR HARPER [inaudible] YES. VERY MUCH ON MISTER CHAIRMAN MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR AN UNSCRUPULOUS PERSON TO CHEAT BY SENDING IN A FAKE SIGNATURE. BY WHICH WOULD OF COURSE DISENFRANCHISED BY EACH OF THE OTHER LEGITIMATE VOTERS. I IS YOU MAY KNOW THE BIPARTISAN NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FEDERAL ELECTION REFORM WARNED THAT STATES. I A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT THE GROWING YOU QUOTE THE GROWING USE OF ABSENTEE VOTING HAS TURNED THIS AREA VOTING INTO THE MOST LIKELY OPPORTUNITY. FOR ELECTION FRAUD NOW ENCOUNTERED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ON QUOTE AN OCCASSION STATES TO LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOTE BY MAIL ABUSES. ELECTION LAW EXPERT PROFESSOR. RICK HASTEN THE CHANT FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE UP PROFESSOR OF LAW AT UC IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW HAS NOTED THAT A SMART WAY TO QUOTE STEAL AN ELECTION IS THROUGH THE SALE OF ABSENTEE BALLOTS. THAT TRANSACTION CAN BE DONE IN PRIVATE. THE PERSON BUYING THE BALLOTS CAN BUY BLANK ONES FROM CHEATING VOTERS AND THE QUE AYE AND THEN CAST THE BALLOTS HIMSELF OR HERSELF. THESE BALLOTS CAN SIMPLY BECAUSE SIMPLY. CAST BY SIMPLY MAILING THEM IT IS EASY TO FIND CASES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY EVERY YEAR OF FRAUD OR ATTEMPTED FRAUD WITH ABSENTEE BALLOTS UNQUOTE. WHEN PEOPLE SIGN THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT? THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE AN ORIGINAL SIGNATURE TODAY. BUT UNDER YOUR BILL IF THE SIGNATURE DOESN'T MATCH THE VOTERS RECORDS SOMEONE COULD THEN SEND IN A COPY. OF THE VOTERS WRECKED SIGNATURE BY EMAIL OR FAX. THEY COULD PHOTOSHOP THE VOTER SIGNATURE ONTO A VERIFICATION STATEMENT AND THEN SEND A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT BY EMAIL OR FAX. AND SINCE IT WOULD BE A COPY I FRAUD WOULD IN FACT BE UNDETECTABLE. SOLUTION I WOULD ASK IS WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO AMEND THE BILL TO REQUIRES THAT THE VOTER RETURN THE FORM WITH AN ORIGINAL SIGNATURE. AND RETURNING THAT FORM EITHER IN PERSON BY MAIL OR DELIVERY SERVICE I'D DIE SPRUCE UP PROVIDING THE SAME INTEGRITY AS THE IS THE ACTUAL YOU KNOW WHAT SIGNATURE. AUDITS ON THE SAME UP BALLOT ITSELF. THROUGH THE CHAIR EMBASSY THINKING THE VICE CHAIR FOR THE COMMENTS. YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT -- THIS LEGISLATURE AND IT ACTUALLY INITIATED WITHIN THE STATE ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT FORTY ASSEMBLYMAN QUIRK -- AND CALIFORNIA LAW IN WE ALL ACTUALLY VOTED ON IT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. ALONG WITH MYSELF. LET ALLOWS A VOTER WHO DID NOT SIGN THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT TO RETURN A COMPLETED UNSIGNED BALLOT STATEMENT. BY EMAIL. IT'S A LOT IN LITERALLY EVERYONE OF US. ARE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED WHO ARE ON THIS COMMITTEE. SO THAT WOULD WELCOME ANY SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO BE A TO STRENGTHEN THE LAW AND TO BE A TO WORK ON THAT -- BUT THAT WE CODIFIED THE ABILITY FOR VOTERS TO BE OF THE MOVE ARE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE FOR A SIGNATURE VIA EMAIL FOR LAST YEAR. A IN WOULD WELCOME ANY SUGGESTIONS IN THE FUTURE HOW TO BETTER STRENGTHEN LA. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY I A FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I BELIEVE THAT IT'S A VERY INCONSISTENT FROST REQUIRE A VOTE BY MAIL ENVELOPES SIGNATURE TO BE THE ORIGINAL BUT IF IT DOESN'T MATCH. I WHICH EVIDENCE THAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN SIGNED IT THAT THEY CAN SEND AN EMAIL COPY -- EMAILED A COPY OF THE VOTER REGISTER A SIGNATURE WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THE REAL VOTER HAS SIGNED THE FORM. AND WHEN WE HAVE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF VOTER FRAUD WE NEED REQUIRE STRONG GUARANTEES. FOR THE AUTHENTICITY OF A FOLLOW UP SIGNATURE NOT WEAKER PROTECTION. I I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF THE AUTHOR HOUSE -- WITH TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE. AND I'D BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THIS IF IT WAS REQUIRING AN ACTUAL SIGNATURE BUT BECAUSE OF THE A FAX OR COPY ISSUE. BUT I CAN'T VOTE FOR THE BILL SO I APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT ISSUE FAMOUS RISE SHARE MISTER MULLIN. THING WAS CHAIR AND THANK YOU MISS REQUIRE FOR HOW. PUSHING THIS ISSUE IT'S BUILDING ON SOME LEGISLATION I HAD -- ON SIGNATURE VERIFICATION EN. ARE AYE HAILED AYE COME FROM ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES THAT IS IS MOVING TO AN ALL VOTE BY MAIL. MODEL HAS ALREADY MOVED TO AN ALL MALE BALLOTS SO THIS WILL BE AN INCREASING -- ISSUE THE IMPORTANCE SO MIGHT MY ONLY QUESTION HERE IS WITH REGARD. TO THE V. SIGNATURES SHALL COMPARE. COMPONENT HERE. THAT ULTIMATELY -- THIS THE UPDATED SIGNATURE IS STILL COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL VOTER REGISTRATION CARD. AND I GUESS MY CONCERN IS JUST ABOUT WITH THE WHOLE A RANGE OF ISSUES AROUND SIGNATURES A EVOLVING OVER TIME -- IT'S STILL PAID BACK TO THAT ORIGINAL VOTER REGISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE INSIDE WHEN THEY WERE EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN ARE. AND YOU KNOW. HOPEFULLY THE REGISTRARS ARE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TO OTHER DOCUMENTS ON FILE THAT HAVE MORE UPDATED SIGNATURES SO THERE MAY BE NO WAY AROUND -- THIS ISSUE I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY ARE. GETTING AT THIS THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE WITH THIS OF VERIFICATION STATEMENT US SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR THE EFFORT. I JUST THINK IT YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WILL ALLOW. YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO PERPLEX US ODD GOING FORWARD. ARE BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH -- BALLOTS SAID AND FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU SITE BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT I THINK IT BUILDS ON EXISTING EFFORTS AND NOW I'M A PROUD TO SUPPORT IT AND NOW. HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU WHY TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THIS AND SEE HOW WE MIGHT FURTHER REFINE THE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS GO FORWARD. THEY LOOK AT THROUGH THE CHAIR I AYE IN ANNOUNCING THAT BECAUSE THE SOMEONE IS HERE IN FRONT OF US TODAY BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THIS IN THE MEMBER SOME NEVER MULLIN. A FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND YOU HAVE BEEN. OUTSPOKEN IN ADVANCING SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATION I'M AND ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU WOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. OTHER YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IT WOULD BE COMPARED TO THE ARE THE CARD ON FILE. ON I'LL A TRIP OVER THAT TIM'S MY FIRM THE SECTOR A STATE OFFICE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ABILITY. UP BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE IN TRULY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AS WELL. AND SO WE CAN LOOK INTO THAT AND THE SPECIFIC CUTS ACTION WHICH PROVIDES FOR HOW THE AFFIDAVIT IS ON FILE IN THAT PROP. CONSULTING WITH THE WRECKAGE ACTIVE. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- CENTER WHERE HE LIKE TO CLOSE AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR THINKING YOUR STAFF THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I ABOUT. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING THIS BEFORE -- TO I'D HAD A CHAT WITH WITH MY STAFF ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT MISTER MULLIN RAISED -- WHICH IS A INTERESTING ONE MY I KNOW MY SIGNATURE IS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE I WAS EIGHTEEN ERRED WILL EIGHTEEN I WANT TO REGISTER TO VOTE BUT I KNOW THAT -- THE AND IN THE BE -- OF MY SIGNATURE STILL PRETTY SIMILAR -- AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A LOT OF REGISTRARS WILL SIMILARITIES -- TO TRY DE KIND OF VERIFY THAT IT'S IT'S THE SAME SIGNATURE JUST ADDRESSING THIS CONCERNED. UP. IN THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THIS FOR WIDESPREAD ELECTION IN INFLUENCING IN AND HACKING -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE RIGHT TO THE REGISTRAR WILL USE THE CONTACT INFORMATION THAT IS ON FILE. TO NOTIFY THE VOTER OF THE MISMATCH IN SIGNATURE AND SO IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO UTILIZE THIS. FOR WIDESPREAD ELECTION INFLUENCING -- THEY WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE -- TO SUBMITS A WHOLE LOT OF BALLOTS BE ABSENTEE MAIL THAT WOULD WOULD -- YOU KNOW KIND OF ADDRESS THEIR THEIR GOAL BUT THEN THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TO INTERCEPT -- WHATEVER -- A COMMUNICATION HAPPENS FROM A REGISTRAR TO THAT VOTER -- AND I THINK I WON THEIR LA CONCERNS AROUND -- ALL THESE NEFARIOUS EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE ABSENTEE. NOW VOTING AND AND OTHER WAYS THAT WE'VE THE POLICIES WE'VE CREATED TO INCREASE TURNOUT THE ONLY DOCUMENTED ELECTION INFLUENCING ON A WIDESPREAD SCALE THAT'S HAPPENED IN AMERICA AND IN DECADES. ALWAYS BY OF ON A MERE PUTIN IN THE RUSSIANS TO SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THEY FOUND A DIFFERENT WAY. OUGHT TO INFLUENCE OUR ELECTIONS THAT DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ABSENTEE VOTING SO I HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD. A HACKING AND I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU CENTER YOUR THINKING ON THAT I WILL SAY ME. BRIGITTE.
