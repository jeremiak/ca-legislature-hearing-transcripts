WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN I

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:09.573 region:rollup2

NONVIOLENCE.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:52.349 region:rollup2
THE FIGHTS OF THE ONLY WAY THEY

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.717 region:rollup2
WILL LISTEN TO US IS IF WE

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.886 region:rollup2

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:12.736 region:rollup2
YOU GET MORE DONE WITH NON

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:15.205 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT LET

01:01:12.736 --> 01:01:16.473 region:rollup2

VERY PERTINENT FOR TODAY'S

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:31.388 region:rollup2
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:32.856 region:rollup2
THE OTHER.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:34.291 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING THAT YOU WON'T

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:36.426 region:rollup2
HEAR ABOUT OR READ ABOUT

01:01:34.291 --> 01:01:38.128 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TOO MUCH IN THE PAPERS.

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:39.396 region:rollup2
BUT JUST GROWING UP IN THE AREA.

01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:41.531 region:rollup2
IS THE DEDICATION TO HARD WORK

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:43.300 region:rollup2
AND PERSEVERANCE.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.501 region:rollup2
AND THE PERSEVERANCE IS ONE OF

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.502 region:rollup2
THINGS I WANT HIGHLY BECAUSE WE

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:47.204 region:rollup2
ALWAYS READ ABOUT THE

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:48.505 region:rollup2

HARD TIMES.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.477 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU TALK TO HIS FAMILY

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:55.812 region:rollup2
YEAR TALK UP TO TALK TO PEOPLE

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:57.013 region:rollup2
THAT GREW UP IN THE AREA.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:58.381 region:rollup2
THEY'LL TELL YOU ABOUT A LOT OF

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:59.249 region:rollup2
TIMES.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:02.352 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY CAME UP ON THE SHORT

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:04.321 region:rollup2
END OF THE STICK.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:07.157 region:rollup2
AND CESAR USED TO TELL HIS KIDS.

01:02:04.321 --> 01:02:08.692 region:rollup2
USED TO TELL THEM.

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.960 region:rollup2
IF YOU FOUGHT AS HARD AS YOU

01:02:08.692 --> 01:02:10.994 region:rollup2
COULD FIGHT AND YOU DID

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.195 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT YOU COULD

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:14.497 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY DO.

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:16.199 region:rollup2
THE NEW DIDN'T LOSE.

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.801 region:rollup2
THE ONLY TIME YOU LOSE IS WHEN

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:19.102 region:rollup2
YOU GIVE UP HOPE.

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.904 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU NO LONGER GET UP DUST

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:21.438 region:rollup2
YOURSELF OFF.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:24.975 region:rollup2
WHICH IS YOU TO FIGHT FOR

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:27.611 region:rollup2
ANOTHER DAY.

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:29.879 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:31.881 region:rollup2
CESAR CHAVEZ PASSED AWAY.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:34.417 region:rollup2

CLOSE WITH A COUPLE OF THINGS.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.062 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:47.530 region:rollup2

01:02:49.199 --> 01:02:53.136 region:rollup2
THAT ONE SOCIAL CHANGE BEGINS

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.938 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT BE REVERSED.

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:56.406 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT AND EDUCATE THE

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:59.209 region:rollup2

01:02:56.406 --> 01:03:00.243 region:rollup2
YOU CAN THAT.

01:02:59.209 --> 01:03:01.945 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT HUMILIATE THE PERSON
