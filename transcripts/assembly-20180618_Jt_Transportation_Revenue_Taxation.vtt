RECOMMENDATIONS --

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.370 region:rollup2
WE DON'T DO THAT WITH THE

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:11.772 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE STATE

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.575 region:rollup2
LAW REQUIRES US TO PREPARE AN

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:15.809 region:rollup2
IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS --

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.977 region:rollup2

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:18.979 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THE MERITS OF

WAY OR THE OTHER ON THEM --

ESTIMATING ITS FISCAL A FAX --

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:32.893 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING I WE KNOW IS

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:35.262 region:rollup2
THAT THE HENDO AND MY COMMENTS

TODAY OUR TENTATIVE OUR FINAL

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:39.166 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS ISN'T DUE TO THE

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.968 region:rollup2

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.937 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS OF PREPARING IT SO I

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.639 region:rollup2
WOULD CHEAT THESE --

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:48.976 region:rollup2
REMARKS AND HENDEL AS TENTATIVE

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:51.211 region:rollup2
FOR NOW.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:52.446 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU TURN TO THE PAGE OF

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.081 region:rollup2
THE HANDOUT LABELED BACKGROUND

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:55.949 region:rollup2
HOW QUICKLY.

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:57.084 region:rollup2
GO OVER SOME BACKGROUND MATERIAL

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.518 region:rollup2
TO GET YOU ORIENTED BUT YOU

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:59.052 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:00.487 region:rollup2
MUCH OF IT --

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.089 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:04.057 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN ONLY PASS THE

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:05.392 region:rollup2
TAX WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:06.593 region:rollup2
AND THE LEGISLATURE'S --

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:08.128 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE VOTERS ARE NOT

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.696 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN --

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:10.464 region:rollup2
PASSING THESE TAX INCREASES IT'S

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.998 region:rollup2
JUST DONE THROUGH THE

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.699 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN THIS TO THE

00:02:10.998 --> 00:02:14.468 region:rollup2

I'M TERMS THIS FUEL AND VEHICLE

IS AUTHOR IN TAXES ON VEHICLES.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.381 region:rollup2
THE STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.449 region:rollup2
THAT THE REVENUES FROM THESE

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.317 region:rollup2
TAXES BE SPENT ON TRANSPORTATION

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.918 region:rollup2
PURPOSES.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.553 region:rollup2
ON WITH ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:35.222 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.057 region:rollup2
ON THOSE REVENUES ARE NOT

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:39.726 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO TRANSPORTATION.

00:02:37.057 --> 00:02:41.561 region:rollup2
AND CURRENTLY THEY LET LET JUST

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:44.831 region:rollup2
THEM -- TO

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:46.533 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR HEALTH AND

SAFETY PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED AT

00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:52.939 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL --

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:55.308 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE RECENTLY

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.444 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:58.879 region:rollup2

00:02:57.444 --> 00:03:00.380 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN TO INCREASE.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.081 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE FUEL AND VEHICLE TAX

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.549 region:rollup2
IS -- TO

FUND HIGHWAY AND ROAD

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.220 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TRANSIT PROGRAMS

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:09.623 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.791 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A FIGURE ON PAGE --

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:12.559 region:rollup2
TO WHERE WE SUMMARIZE THE

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.861 region:rollup2
VARIOUS --

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:16.229 region:rollup2
TAXES AND AND FEES THAT WERE

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.564 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE SP ONE I WON'T GO

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.032 region:rollup2
THROUGH ALL OF THEM SINCE I'M

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.834 region:rollup2
SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE FAIRLY

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:22.202 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH THE PACKAGE --

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:25.272 region:rollup2
BUT BROADLY SPEAKING --

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:26.640 region:rollup2
SP ONE INCREASED GAS GAS TAXES

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:27.808 region:rollup2
DIESEL TAXES.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.242 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS CREATED IN YOU

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.577 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEE

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:33.213 region:rollup2
ON VEHICLES AND I ZERO EMISSION

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:34.581 region:rollup2
VEHICLE FEE --

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.049 region:rollup2
IF YOU THESE --

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:38.518 region:rollup2
THIS CHARGER STARTED TAKING A

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.619 region:rollup2
FACT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:41.354 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN ON IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.323 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK THE LAST COLUMNS

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:45.292 region:rollup2
OF THE FIGURE WE SHOW THE

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.660 region:rollup2
ESTIMATED ANNUAL REVENUES FROM

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:48.595 region:rollup2
SP.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.162 region:rollup2
ONE IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.464 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND

00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:52.099 region:rollup2
IT'S ESTIMATED AT FOUR POINT

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:54.334 region:rollup2
FOUR BILLION --

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.835 region:rollup2
GROWING IN A COUPLE YEARS TO A

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:56.770 region:rollup2
LITTLE OVER FIVE BILLION

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:58.572 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.007 region:rollup2
I'M THE REASON WHY INCREASES IS

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:02.242 region:rollup2
THAT NOT ALL OF THE CHARGES HAVE

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.777 region:rollup2
TAKEN EFFECT YET.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.845 region:rollup2
ON AND ALSO THE CHARGES ARE

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:06.379 region:rollup2
INDEXED FOR INFLATION IN THE

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.347 region:rollup2
FUTURE SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY THEY

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.985 region:rollup2
THINK GROW.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:13.220 region:rollup2
IN THE OUT YEARS.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.188 region:rollup2
SO REGARDING THE INITIATIVE

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.389 region:rollup2
MEASURE WE DESCRIBED ON PAGE

00:04:15.188 --> 00:04:19.259 region:rollup2
THREE OF THE HANDOUT IT'S AN

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.194 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION --

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.496 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY DOES TWO THINGS.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:23.864 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT REQUIRES THE

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.565 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO GET VOTER

00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:27.501 region:rollup2
APPROVAL FOR SPECIFIED FUELING

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:28.502 region:rollup2
VEHICLE TAXES.

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:30.370 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY THE SUPPLIES TO

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:31.638 region:rollup2
TAXES ON THE SALE STORAGE USE

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.707 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMPTION OF GASOLINE AND

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:35.008 region:rollup2
DIESEL FUEL.

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:36.176 region:rollup2
IT ALSO APPLIES TO TAXES PAID

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:38.211 region:rollup2
FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF OPERATING A

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.379 region:rollup2
VEHICLE ON PUBLIC HIGHWAYS.

00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.747 region:rollup2
AND SUCH AS VEHICLE LICENSE FEES

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:42.082 region:rollup2
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL

00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:42.682 region:rollup2
AS TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:45.952 region:rollup2
FEES WHICH WERE CREATED BY S.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:47.053 region:rollup2
B..

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:48.788 region:rollup2
THE SECOND THING THE INITIATIVE

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:50.657 region:rollup2
MEASURE DOES IS IT ELIMINATES

00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:52.192 region:rollup2
RECENTLY ENACTED --

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:53.793 region:rollup2
SUCH SUCH RECENTLY ENACTED FUEL

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:57.330 region:rollup2
AND VEHICLE TAX IS.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:58.031 region:rollup2
A SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD APPLY.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.167 region:rollup2
TO ANY SUCH FEELING VEHICLE

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.601 region:rollup2
TAXES AND ACTED BETWEEN JANUARY

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:03.770 region:rollup2
FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.771 region:rollup2
DATE THE MEASURE TAKES A FAT.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.739 region:rollup2
AND IF IT IS PASSED BY THE

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.176 region:rollup2
VOTERS WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:11.044 region:rollup2
DECEMBER --

00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:13.513 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO SENSE SB

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.114 region:rollup2
ONE WAS ENACTED IN APRIL.

00:05:13.513 --> 00:05:19.219 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS MEASURE

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:19.519 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY TO THE TAXES IN SP

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.155 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:24.858 region:rollup2
ONE AND ON THE LAST PAGE I

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:26.092 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZE THE FISCAL AFFECTS

00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:27.194 region:rollup2
THAT OUR OFFICE --

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:28.962 region:rollup2
HAS ESTIMATED WE THINK THERE'S

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:30.463 region:rollup2
TWO MAIN FISCAL IMPLICATIONS

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.198 region:rollup2
FROM THE INITIATIVE.

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:31.798 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT WOULD

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:34.267 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE TAX REVENUES FROM SP

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:35.202 region:rollup2
--

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:36.903 region:rollup2
ONE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:38.104 region:rollup2
OF THE SORT OF ONGOING IN THE

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.372 region:rollup2
OUT YEARS THIS WOULD BE ROUGHLY

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:41.241 region:rollup2
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.542 region:rollup2
AND LESS FUNDING --

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:43.977 region:rollup2
IN THIS FUNDING MAINLY WOULD

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.445 region:rollup2
HAVE SUPPORTED HIGHWAY AND ROAD

00:05:43.977 --> 00:05:47.347 region:rollup2
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR PROGRAMS

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:48.181 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS TRANSIT PROGRAMS AND

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:51.384 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER TRANSPORTATION

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.652 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS --

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:54.087 region:rollup2
THAT MEASURE THOUGH DOES NOT

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:55.288 region:rollup2
AFFECT OTHER PROVISIONS THAT

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:56.923 region:rollup2
WERE IN SB ONE IT REALLY REALLY

00:05:55.288 --> 00:05:58.291 region:rollup2
JUST WOULD ELIMINATE THE TAX

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:59.526 region:rollup2
REVENUES SO S. B. ONE DID

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:02.028 region:rollup2
CONTAIN SOME OTHER.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:04.130 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS REGARDING --

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:05.599 region:rollup2
INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY --

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.700 region:rollup2
OVER TRANSPORTATION SPENDING IT

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.436 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT AFFECT THOSE THOSE

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.403 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS.

00:06:09.436 --> 00:06:12.272 region:rollup2
THE SECOND MAN FISCAL

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:13.106 region:rollup2
IMPLICATION THAT WE SEE IS THAT

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:14.641 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE --

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.942 region:rollup2
PASSAGE OF FUEL AND VEHICLE

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:18.211 region:rollup2
TAXES IN THE FUTURE MORE

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:19.379 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT AND THIS IS DUE TO THE

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:19.980 region:rollup2
VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENT WOULD

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:22.315 region:rollup2
BE ANOTHER STEP IN THE PROCESS

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.618 region:rollup2
--

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:25.085 region:rollup2
TO INCREASING TAXES SO COULD

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:26.353 region:rollup2
MEAN LESS REVENUE THAN

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:28.221 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:30.056 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WHERE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.092 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS OF THIS --

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:33.960 region:rollup2
AS IT WOULD DEPEND ON FUTURE.

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:36.263 region:rollup2
THE VOTERS WHICH WE CANNOT

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.097 region:rollup2
PREDICT.

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:40.867 region:rollup2
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:43.470 region:rollup2
THANKS.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:44.871 region:rollup2

HAVE A SIMPLE PROCESS NOW ON TO

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:51.945 region:rollup2
OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.546 region:rollup2

SO.

00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:16.403 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A WHY DON'T WE START

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.837 region:rollup2

ONLY ONE HERE IN FAVOR OF THE

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:36.723 region:rollup2
MEASURE SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:37.924 region:rollup2
THAT I GO FIRST ANYWAY --

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:39.826 region:rollup2
AGAIN THIS MEASURE WOULD REPEAL

00:07:37.924 --> 00:07:41.594 region:rollup2
THE GAS AND CAR TAX AND PUT IT

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:43.997 region:rollup2
ANY FUTURE SOME MORE TAXES TO A

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:45.498 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.

DOLLAR BUDGET WITH ANY BILLION

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:53.473 region:rollup2
DOLLAR SURPLUS AT A TIME WHEN WE

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:54.874 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST

00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:57.043 region:rollup2
GAS AND CAR TAXES.

00:07:54.874 --> 00:07:58.411 region:rollup2
IN THE NATION.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:08:00.246 region:rollup2
YES TAXES ARE TOO HIGH BUT

00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:02.048 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT PRIMARILY THE REASON

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:04.150 region:rollup2
WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:06.152 region:rollup2
WE OPPOSE THESE TAXES BECAUSE OF

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.387 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATURE'S INABILITY TO

NOW THAT WE KNOW THE AWARDED

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:28.401 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:30.003 region:rollup2
REPEAL MAJOR WERE TO PASS.

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:31.337 region:rollup2

SAFE.

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:39.045 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT OCCUR.

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:40.313 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF HIGHWAY BRIDGES

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.482 region:rollup2

THOUSANDS OF MILES OF PAPER

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.953 region:rollup2

00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:48.555 region:rollup2
HIGHWAYS.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:49.656 region:rollup2

TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:22.655 region:rollup2
MANY WOULD LIKELY BE DELAYED

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.891 region:rollup2
UNTIL AFTER THE GAMES OCCUR.

00:10:22.655 --> 00:10:26.326 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE.

00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:27.460 region:rollup2
IF THE REPEAL WERE TO OCCUR

00:10:26.326 --> 00:10:28.795 region:rollup2
PAVEMENT WOULD GET WORSE INSTEAD

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.762 region:rollup2
OF BETTER.

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.965 region:rollup2
SAFETY PROJECTS WOULD BE

DEFUNDED.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:35.368 region:rollup2

EVERY OTHER CHP OFFICER.

00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:01.227 region:rollup2
THAT KEEPING OUR ROADS

ONE THE LOSS OF THESE FUNDS

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.839 region:rollup2
WOULD DERAIL PROJECTS LARGE AND

00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.607 region:rollup2
SMALL.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.143 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY

00:19:34.607 --> 00:19:38.411 region:rollup2
OF LIFE IN OUR SUFFERS FROM

00:19:37.143 --> 00:19:40.179 region:rollup2

MEANT.

00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.590 region:rollup2
A GATEWAY CITIES FOR A

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:53.125 region:rollup2
CROSSROADS THE ESTIMATED COST OF

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.327 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN POINT

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:57.296 region:rollup2
EIGHT MILLION AND THE THIRTY TWO

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:59.465 region:rollup2
MILLION SP ONE FUNDS.

00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:00.566 region:rollup2
IN DISCRETIONARY ALLOCATION THAT

00:19:59.465 --> 00:20:02.635 region:rollup2
WILL ALLOW THE PROJECT TO

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:04.737 region:rollup2
ADVANCE TO CONSTRUCTION ALSO THE

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:07.173 region:rollup2
WEST SANTA ANA BRANCH LIKE REAL

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:09.175 region:rollup2

EVERYONE ON THIS DIES THAT NO

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.403 region:rollup2
ONE OPPOSES INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:15.705 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT --

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:16.540 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CLEAR DISAGREEMENTS ON

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:18.375 region:rollup2
HOW TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.376 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS AND I THINK IT'S

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:21.578 region:rollup2
VERY APPARENT.

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:23.847 region:rollup2
A OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:25.982 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS AND COWBOY

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:26.550 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS THEY WANT TO SAY AND

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:29.085 region:rollup2
SO.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:30.587 region:rollup2
ON IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES I

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:33.123 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:34.824 region:rollup2
AS LEGISLATORS TO TALK ABOUT

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:36.126 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES TO FIGURE OUT.

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:38.261 region:rollup2
FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT COULD

01:01:36.126 --> 01:01:45.168 region:rollup2
YOU COULD YOU BE USE CONTINUE TO

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:47.704 region:rollup2
FUNDING OF IMPORTANT

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:51.408 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:54.544 region:rollup2
A WE JUST PASSED A EL HUNDRED

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:55.745 region:rollup2
NINE NINE BILLION DOLLAR --

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:57.247 region:rollup2
BUDGET WITH LESS THAN.

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:58.114 region:rollup2
THREE IN THAT BUDGET THAT WILL

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:00.183 region:rollup2
GO TO ROAD [inaudible]

01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:02.752 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:04.654 region:rollup2
AND SO IF OUR PRIORITIES AND IF

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:06.289 region:rollup2
EVERYONE AGREES.

01:02:04.654 --> 01:02:08.992 region:rollup2
THAT TRANSPORTATION ROAD

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:10.594 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A PRIORITY.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:12.262 region:rollup2
THEN WE MUST MATCH THAT PRIORITY

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:14.130 region:rollup2
WITH FUNDING.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:16.967 region:rollup2
AND SO IF LESS THAN 3% OF OUR

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:19.069 region:rollup2
FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:19.703 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO ROADS THEY'RE WE

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:21.238 region:rollup2
NEED TO ANSWER TO THE PUBLIC FOR

01:02:19.703 --> 01:02:23.473 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:25.008 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE IS PROPOSITION TWO

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:26.476 region:rollup2
THE RAINY DAY FUND.

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:27.644 region:rollup2
IN THAT SENSE CLEARLY STATES

01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:29.145 region:rollup2
THAT IF WE WANT TO SAVE ABOVE

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:30.847 region:rollup2
AND BEYOND THE RAINY DAY FUND

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:32.649 region:rollup2
THAT THAT FUNDING.

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:34.017 region:rollup2
WOULD GO TEMPERATURE AFTER THE

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:36.620 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING BUDGET YEAR.

01:02:34.017 --> 01:02:38.822 region:rollup2
AND THIS LEGISLATURE CHOSE NOT

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:40.590 region:rollup2
TO PUT ANY MORE FUNDING INTO THE

01:02:38.822 --> 01:02:42.325 region:rollup2
MADE A FINE UNDER PROP.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.393 region:rollup2
TWO AND SO WE HAD THAT CHOICE

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:45.262 region:rollup2
AND WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT CHOICE

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:46.863 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.064 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND I

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.966 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE CHAIRMEN IN HIS

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:51.334 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP ON THIS IS THAT WE

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:52.535 region:rollup2
NEED TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.803 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:54.671 region:rollup2
GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT HAS

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.139 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN INVESTED.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:57.874 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY I THINK MOST OF

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:59.309 region:rollup2
THE PROPONENTS ABOUT SIZA

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:00.944 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS AND PROPONENTS OF AS

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.145 region:rollup2

NEED PUBLIC SHOULD BE SPENDING

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:05.015 region:rollup2
MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:06.349 region:rollup2
AND SEES THE SAFETY AND AND A

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:08.118 region:rollup2
WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT WOULD

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:09.219 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:11.388 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:12.489 region:rollup2
A TO PROVIDE NEEDED INVESTMENTS

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:14.424 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION SO

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:16.559 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST ASK THAT AS WE

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:17.727 region:rollup2
DISCUSS LEARN THE FUTURE OF

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:19.362 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:21.031 region:rollup2
AND TRANSMISSION INVESTMENT IS

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.898 region:rollup2
THAT THIS DISCUSSION DOESN'T END

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.700 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:26.369 region:rollup2

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:23.827 region:rollup2

OF S. B. ONE TAKING PLACE.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.802 region:rollup2
BY INFRASTRUCTURE NO ROADS

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:35.839 region:rollup2

BY DOING THIS I MISSED SOMETHING

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.591 region:rollup2

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:56.025 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED.

01:04:54.591 --> 01:04:57.794 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THINK

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:59.329 region:rollup2
MAKE GOOD SENSE OF THE

CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THIS

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.977 region:rollup2
