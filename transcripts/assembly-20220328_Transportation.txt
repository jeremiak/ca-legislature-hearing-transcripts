FOUR ZERO OKAY THE CONSENT FILE IS ADOPTED THAT BILL IS OUT I'M GONNA HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON WE HAVE THIRTEEN BILLS TO DISCUSS TODAY FIRST UP IS AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT I SEE MISTER KILEY IS HERE. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THE MISTER VICE CHAIR- I- I DO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR GIVING THIS BILL A PROMPT HEARING- IT WAS INTRODUCED ON JANUARY TWELFTH BUT WAS ONLY JUST REFERRED TO COMMITTEE- THIS LAST THURSDAY. THIS BILL IS VERY SIMPLE IT WILL SUSPEND OUR STATE'S GAS TAX SPECIFICALLY ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT PLACES A SIX MONTH MORATORIUM ON THE CALIFORNIA ON THE COLLECTION OF CALIFORNIA'S STATE EXCISE TAX ON GASOLINE AMOUNTING TO FIFTY ONE CENTS. PER GALLON. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA HAS BY FAR THE HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN THE COUNTRY THEY HAVE REACHED TRULY UNIMAGINABLE LEVELS NEARLY SIX DOLLARS PER GALLON. THIS IS A WELL ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE A DOLLAR AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS MORE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND IS SEVENTY CENTS HIGHER THAN THE NEXT CLOSEST STATE. THE EFFECTS OF THIS GAS TAX ON THESE RECORD HIGH GAS PRICES ARE EXTREMELY REGRESSIVE. THAT'S WHY A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THAT 47% OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS SAID THAT THE RISE IN FUEL COSTS IS POSING A SERIOUS FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO HAS TO COMMUTE A LONG DISTANCE TO WORK OR MAYBE YOU HAVE KIDS YOU NEED TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OR MAYBE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. WHERE THERE ISN'T EASY ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORT THEN THIS POSES EVEN MORE OF A HARDSHIP THE FACT IS THAT NOT EVERY CALIFORNIAN CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A TESLA DELIVERED TO THEIR HOME TOMORROW. AND MANY CALIFORNIANS MANY OF HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BEAR THESE COSTS AND TO PAY MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INCOME- TO FUEL COSTS. THIS BILL PRESENTS A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION. IT IS A LOVER OF THAT WE CAN PULL IMMEDIATELY IT HAS URGENCY BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOLKS WITH SOME MEASURE OF RELIEF. FIFTY ONE CENTS A GALLON WILL NOT BRING GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA DOWN TO REASONABLE LEVELS BUT IT WILL HELP MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW. SIMPLY BY PASSING THIS BILL. NOW I WANT TO. RAINY ANSWER A FEW OBJECTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED THIS BILL. THE FIRST IS THAT SOMEHOW CUTTING THE STATE'S GAS TAX WILL NOT RESULT IN A BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS THIS NOTION HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY DEBUNKED. THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH FOUND A COMPLETE PASS THROUGH OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE DIESEL AND GASOLINE TAXES TO CONSUMERS. MOREOVER ARE ONLY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS FOUND THAT MOST OF THE CHANGE IN THE TAX RATE LIKELY WILL BE PASSED THROUGH THE PRICES AT THE PUMP. BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO LOOK AT STUDIES OR ANALYSTS WE CAN SIMPLY LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WORLD. OTHER STATES LIKE MARYLAND AND GEORGIA CHOSE TO SUSPEND THEIR STATE GAS TAX AND THEY SOUGHT AN IMMEDIATE REDUCTION IN THE PRICE THAT CONSUMERS WERE PAYING AT THE PUMP. THE SECOND OBJECTION. IS THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN A LOSS OF FUNDING FOR ROADS. FROM THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE BILL THIS IS CLEARLY FALSE. THE BILL WOULD BACK FILL ANY LOSS OF FUNDING FOR ROADS OUT OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND AND LET'S REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE A VERY LARGE SURPLUS. RIGHT NOW. FINALLY I WANT TO ADDRESS THESE VARIOUS REBATE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED BUT BY MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. AND BY THE GOVERNOR. I THINK THAT REBATES ARE A GOOD IDEA IN FACT I THINK WHEN THERE'S A SURPLUS THIS SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH AUTOMATIC. WE SHOULD GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE FOLKS THAT WE GOT IT FROM. I THINK THAT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED SHOULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT I THINK IT SHOULD BE PERMANENT I AM READY AND WILLING AND EAGER. TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE I'M GIVING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE OVERTAXED SOME MUCH NEEDED TAX RELIEF. BUT THAT IS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE QUESTION. FROM WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE AND SPECIFIC PROBLEM. OF RECORD HIGH GAS PRICES. WHAT I HAVE PROPOSED IS A SPECIFIC AND IMMEDIATE SOLUTION. WHICH IS TO SUSPEND THE TAX THAT WE HAVE ON GAS WHICH IS JUST ABOUT AS HIGH AS ANY IN THE COUNTRY. THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. IN CONNECTICUT FOR EXAMPLE THE MEMBERS OF THAT LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A BILL TO SUSPEND THE STATE GAS TAX. DEMOCRATS VOTED FOR IT REPUBLICANS VOTED FOR IT. THE BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE VERY LIBERAL GOVERNOR ADAMANT. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL BE GRATEFUL IF YOU TAKE THIS STEP TODAY TO PROVIDE SO MANY WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A RELIEF. AND I CAN EQUALLY ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WILL BE DUMBFOUNDED IF THIS LEGISLATURE AGAIN REFUSES TO TAKE THIS MODEST SIMPLE EASY AND COMMONSENSE STEP. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IS ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW IS STRUGGLING. WITH THESE OUTRAGEOUS GAS PRICES ANDREW LEOPARD. I DO TOO TWO MINUTES SIR YOU CAN TESTIFY THEY'RE PROBABLY THERE WERE NEW IN THIS ROOM SO WE'RE STILL FIGURING OUT YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE BUTTON. ALL RIGHT I'M MY NAME IS ANGELA PROJECT COME TO YOU AS A LIFELONG CALIFORNIA RESIDENT I'M A FATHER A HUSBAND A MARINE CORPS VETERAN- I AM A RESIDENTIAL LOAN OFFICER AND I SHARE. A SMALL NONPROFIT. ROSEVILLE CALIFORNIA THAT'S RAISED OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR VETERAN AND CANCER CAUSES- IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS- MY WIFE OUR COMMUTES FOR WORK AND- SHE DRAWS FROM APPOINTMENT AS WOMEN EVERY DAY AND WITH THE RISING COST OF GOODS AND ESPECIALLY GAS. WE'RE HAVING TO TAKE A LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT WE SPEND MONEY ON. WHETHER IT'S GROCERIES WHETHER IT'S EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES FOR OUR TWO KIDS BEFORE IN A FIVE YEAR OLD- SHE'S TAKING OUR KIDS TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY AND SHE'S DRIVING TO DRIVE FOR WORK AND IT'S CAUSING. M. UNDUE HARDSHIP ON US- HEARD I'VE HAD DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE'VE HAD MANY MANY FRIENDS LEAVE THE STATE JUST DUE TO THE- RISING CRIME AND COSTS OF. LIVING AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND WE'VE SAID THAT HEY WE'RE GONNA STAY IN WE'RE GONNA TRY AND FIGHT IT OUT. BUT WITH THE NOTION ARE WITH THE- PSSIBILITY THAT SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT. EITHER PULLING BACK ON HOW MUCH YOU WORKS OR STOP WORKING AT ALL- JUST BECAUSE OF THE RISING COST OF GAS- THAT MIGHT. BE THE LAST. STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK FOR US LEAVING THE STATE. WHICH I REALLY REALLY HATE TO DO SO- IF YOU COULD PLEASE SUPPORT REPEALING THE GAS TAX THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO MY FAMILY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE'RE FIRST GOING TO GO ON TO A WITNESS ON THE TELEPHONE- SEVERIN BORENSTEIN. IF THE OPERATOR COMPLETES FINE MR BORN SEEN. SHE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES- GOOD- HI I'M SEVERIN BORENSTEIN I'M A PROFESSOR AT UC BERKELEY'S HAAS SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND FACULTY DIRECTOR BANERJEE INCLUDED HOSTAGE I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS SINCE I ONLY A FEW MINUTES ONE IS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO ASSEMBLY MEN KILEY THE STUDIES THAT SHOW FULL PASSED THROUGH AND I'VE DONE ONE OF THEM- ARE WERE NOT DONE AT A TIME WHEN THERE WAS SCARCITY. OF CAPACITY TO PRODUCE GASOLINE AS THERE SEEMS TO BE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW ALIFORNIA SPOT PRICES ARE WELL ABOVE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND USUALLY THERE ARE ABOUT TEN CENTS HIGHER AND THAT GIVES ME GREAT CONCERN THAT IF WE CUT THAT GAS TAX RIGHT NOW AND ECONOMIC THEORY TELLS US THIS- IT WILL NOT ALL BE PASSED THROUGH SO I AM CONCERNED. THAT SOME OF THIS WOULD BE- GO TO- REFINERS AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S A SCARCITY OF REFINERY CAPACITY MY SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ONGOING CHALLENGE OF GASOLINE PRICES IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO WHAT% I'VE CALLED THE MYSTERY GASOLINE SURCHARGE WHICH IS THE EXTRA ON AVERAGE THIRTY CENTS A GALLON THAT APPEARED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. ABOVE THE HIGHER TAXES AND ENVIRONMENTAL FEES- THAT APPEARED AFTER THE TORRANCE REFINERY AND HAS NEVER DISAPPEARED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT COST CALIFORNIANS ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO WHETHER OR NOT THIS PASSES AND YOU REPEAL ARE SUSPEND THE GAS TAX I WOULD URGE YOU TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION WITH REAL RESOURCES AND- REAL POWER TO FIND OUT WHERE THIS EXTRA MONEY IS GOING. THAT IS COSTING CONSUMERS FAR MORE THAN BEING TO THE TRANSITORY INCREASE WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY- AND ALTHOUGH I AM VERY SYMPATHETIC TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING A LOT MORE FOR GAS LINE I'M ALSO VERY SYMPATHETIC PEOPLE ARE PAYING A LOT MORE FOR UTILITY BILLS RIGHT NOW AND FOR RENT- AND- PARTICULARLY WITH ELECTRICITY WHERE WE HAVE OVERPRICED IT. DUE TO PUTTING MANY THINGS THAT LED. WANT INTO UTILITY BILLS- I WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. TAKING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS BACK AND PAYING FOR THEM THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET AND GIVING A BROADER SET OF- CUSTOM CONSUMERS NAY. A BREAK ON THEIR UTILITY BILLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS IN PERSON JEREMY SMITH. WELCOME TO COME TO THE DESK IF YOU LIKE. THANK YOU JUST BE SURE YOU PUSH THE MIKE BUT I'M. DO YOU HEAR ME OK THE REGAL THANK YOU NICE TO BE BACK IN FOR EVERYBODY IN A HEARING ROOM THIS IS A VERY EXCITING AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THAT THIS IS A BILL BY UNION WORKERS UNDER PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY IT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT OUR MEMBERS. HERE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN OPPOSITION- WE WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE FEEL THE PAIN AS WELL THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT FUEL PRICES ARE IN PRICES IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE PAYING. SIX SEVEN DOLLARS FOR GAS AND DIESEL- DRIVING HUNDREDS OF MILES A WEEK TO GET TO WORK AS THEY DO IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY- THIS ON TOP OF LAST YEAR'S MOST CALIFORNIANS CAN BARELY MAKE IT TOO MANY WORKING FAMILIES. ARE MAKING HARD DECISIONS BE BUYING GROCERIES IN THE WAGES AGAIN THE GAS THEY NEED TO GET TO WORK OR SCHOOL THIS IS WHY BE PUSH POLICY MAKERS REVISED SOLUTIONS OF THIS CRISIS. GRADING OTHER CRISIS TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS IS NOT THE ANSWER THOUGH. SETTING ASIDE THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THIS BILL PUT IN JEOPARDY ON ONGOING AND FUTURE PROJECTS ALLOWING A HIGHWAYS AND BY WAYS TO DETERIORATE FROM LACK OF MAINTENANCE WILL CREATE SAFETY ISSUES. AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT THEY'LL TAKE A GENERATION TO CORRECT AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER ADDRESS THE ONE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE GAS TAX HAVE BEEN RAISED IN TWENTY THREE YEARS. WE SUSPENDED TODAY WHO KNOWS. IF WE'LL EVER GET TO GO BACK AGAIN. RIGHT NOW THESE FUNDS OF. THOUGHT OF MIDDLE CLASS- MIDDLE. ON MIDDLE CLASS WAGES. OF ANNA AND JOBS ARE TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE- ANY DISRUPTION THOSE FUNDS COULD LEAD TO. UNDUE DELAY IS AN ONGOING PROJECTS. AS WE OPPOSE THIS BILL WE ALSO URGE LAWMAKERS TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO CALIFORNIANS IN MULTIPLE FORMS. WHETHER BEING A FORMER CHECKS DIRECTLY TO RESIDENTS OR OTHERWISE. DIRECT PAYMENTS RESIDENTS WILL DO MORE QUICKLY. THAN THIS MEASURE. WE ALSO ARE TOUCH LEADERS LOOK BEYOND THE PRICE THE POP IN THE IMMEDIATE PARTIAL CHALLENGE OF THINK ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE. THE LAST YEAR'S ACROSS ANYTHING IS THAT BEING AT THE END OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN WHETHER IT'S THE BABY FORMULA TOILET PAPER OR OIL. IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO BE CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA PORT 60% OIL FROM PLACES LIKE THE AMAZON RAINFOREST THE MIDDLE EAST. AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL UNTIL PRESIDENT BY SUSPENDED IT FROM RUSSIA. FOR AS LONG AS CALIFORNIA'S USING OIL AND GAS WE SHOULD DO BETTER AND- WE CAN BE.

MADAM CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE IT TO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. OF MR LEE. THANK YOU MA'AM JEFF RECOGNIZING ME FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT OF COURSE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE CALIFORNIANS HURTING FROM THE HIGH GAS PRICES OF COURSE WE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT AND THAT'S WHY THIS HOUSE ON THE WORK ON OUR BUDGET. ARE GOING TO PROPOSING ECONOMIC A COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC RELIEF FOR SHORT TERM PROBLEMS BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE THERE IS NOW THE WAR IN UKRAINE. DOES NOT MEAN THIS IS A LONG TERM PROBLEM THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY ALWAYS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF UNSCHOOLED UNCERTAINTY. GAS PRICES ROSE WHEN THERE WAS A THREAT OF WAR WITH IRAN RECENTLY WHEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ASSASSINATE SOLEIMANI WHEN THE US INVADED OUR A ROCK AND LEADING UP TO THE GULF WAR AND NOW THE CO AND NOW THAT THAT WILL PRICE OR SLIGHTLY DROPPING AS OF TODAY BECAUSE THE COVERT LOCKDOWNS SHANGHAI. IT'S YOU KNOW THE THING THAT I GET REALLY IRKED ABOUT IS THERE'S THIS LINE IT'S TOLD TO CONSUMERS THAT THE PRICE OF GAS IS HIGH BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT. BUT THE REASON WHY WE HAVE SB ONE IN THE GAS TAX IS DEFINED THE VERY ROADS THAT ALL THE CAR USERS ENJOY THE HIGHWAYS BRIDGES. AND EVEN PUBLIC TRANSIT. BUT WE REALLY DON'T QUESTION. FOR SOME REASON. IS THE GREED OF CORPORATIONS OF FOSSIL FUEL CORPORATIONS FIVE. FIVE CORPORATIONS RULE ALMOST A MILLION MONOPOLY ON OUR GAS MARKET RIGHT NOW FIVE OF THEM. AND THE FIVE. OUR CHEVRON MARATHON PBF ENERGY PHILLIPS SIXTY SIX AND BOLERO BOLERO THEY HAVE THE MARKET POWER TO SELL GASOLINE TO THEIR BRANDED STATIONS OF THEIR CHOICE. AND THEY ARE ALSO STILL AS ONE OF OUR WITNESSES FROM ECONOMICS ECONOMISTS POINTED OUT THEY STILL CHARGING AND NEARLY FORTY EIGHT CENTS PER GALLON MYSTERY SURCHARGE THAT HAPPENED AFTER THE TORRANCE EXPLOSION THERE'S NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. THEY'RE REAPING IN THE PROFITS FOR IT JUST LAST YEAR BLACK THE TOP TWENTY FOUR FOSSIL FUEL CORPORATIONS THEY LINE THEIR POCKETS WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN RECORD PROFITS A HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE OF OUR STATE BUDGET. SO WHEN THESE OIL MONOPOLY. WHEN THE FOSSIL FUEL CORPORATIONS HAVE A KNOBBLY ON THE MARKET OF COURSE THEY CAN CHARGE IF THEY WANT. AS THE ARGONAUTS ALSO POINTED OUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE. THAT THE SPENDING THE GAS TAX THAT'S ANY SAVINGS. ON THE CONSUMER ARPITA THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IN THIS BILL OR IN REAL LIFE THAT THE SAVINGS ARE PASSED ON THE CONSUMER THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THEM FOR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE NEXT GLOBAL CATASTROPHE. AND UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET TO RAISE GLOBAL LOW GAS PRICES AND THAT IS BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A DEPENDENCY. FEEL BY THE FOSSIL FUEL CORPORATIONS ON GASOLINE CARS THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO SO THAT WE ARE. STOCK BUYING IT IN LAST A GOOD THAT IS IN ECONOMICS ONE A ONE GASOLINE IS IT IN ALASKA GOOD THAT WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY. HAVING TO PAY FOR BUT WE NEVER QUESTIONED THE GREED OF THESE CORPORATIONS. AND YOU KNOW THE AUTHOR TALKS ABOUT SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS. MY MEMBER OF CONGRESS PARTNERING WITH MANY STATE SENATORS EX SENATOR I'M SORRY US SENATORS LIKE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN JEFF MARKLEY AND ED MARKEY. POSING I WINDFALL TAX ON BIG OIL SO THAT MONEY THAT THEY AREN'T FROM US GOES BACK DIRECTLY TO HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA'S OF THE WORKING CLASS AND MIDDLE CLASS AND SOMETHING I NOTICE A LOT IN THE CONSTITUENT ARE. THE FEEDBACK ON THE PHONES A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DIALING IN FROM PLASTER COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY. I WHICH I BELIEVE ARE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES CONSTITUENTS AND I LOOKED IT UP. BUT THOSE CONSTITUENTS JUST LIKE MINE ARE BENEFITING IN THE NET IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM SB ONE PROJECTS ONE THING I SAW WAS THAT JUST IN. PLASTER COUNTY ALONE. LET'S SEE. YOU'RE SERVING YOU GOT SIDEWALK IMPROVEMENTS YOU HAVE ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS BACK THERE'S JUST A SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ALONE FOR PLASTERS PULL A PLASTER SACRAMENTO GATEWAY CORRIDOR THIS IS REAL MONEY THAT IS GOING TO IMPROVE THE DRIVER EXPERIENCE AS WELL THE NOT JUST THE RIDGES AND NOT JUST A TRANSIT BUT ALSO ALSO IF FUNDS THE- LET'S SEE. IS THE TWENTY ONE BUS ROUTES IN PLASTER COUNTY AND AUBURN COUNTY AS WELL SO THIS ALSO SERVES TRANSIT RIDERS. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. AS OUR PART ACROSS OUR TALKS ABOUT IS JUST BECAUSE IN THIS BILL YOU COULD BACK FILL THE GENERAL FUND WE SHOULD BE NOTED THAT. THE SURPLUS IS NOT CONSTANT IT IS NOT A SHORT. AND IF WE- OUR TO FIND OURSELVES IN IT ECONOMIC DEFICIT THE MONEY THAT GOES DIRECTLY TO CONSTITUENTS IN ROADWAYS AND TRANSPORTATION CAN EVAPORATE. AND BY DE FUNDING THE ESSENTIAL MONEY WE'RE PUTTING TOWARDS A ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE A COUPLE YEARS IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. AND AGAIN LIKE A SORE WITNESSES JUST BECAUSE WE POSIT FOR SIX MONTHS IS NO GUARANTEE WE BRING IT BACK. SO YOU KNOW I DEFINITELY IT WOULD SYMPATHIZE I UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT IS RIGHT NOW AND HOW HARD IT IS AT THE PUMP BUT THAT IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE PAYING FOR ROADS IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE CORPORATIONS OUT THERE. WHO ARE FRACKING THE HELL OUT OF THIS A PLANET AND OUR TRIP TRYING TO EXTRACT EVERY CENT A PROFIT BEGAN FROM THE CONSUMER. SO I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC SOLUTION AS WELL. MADAM CHAIR. IF I CAN. YES I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO DO PASSES A MAN'S. IF YOU'RE READY FOR THAT. AND I'VE RECEIVED OKAY MOTION TO BE TO PASS AS AMENDED AND THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE THE FOLLOWING TO ONE STRIKEOUT ALL CURRENT CONTENTS OF THE BILL TO IMPOSE A NEW VEHICLE RAFEAL WHISTLES ACTED I'M NOT GONNA HAVE MY BILL THAT WE GET THAT DONE AS SOON AS A LIST OF KILEY MR KILEY PRESENTING A BELL I'M NOT GIVING YOU GUYS A VESSEL. BUT CONSIDER SOME OTHER. MICROPHONE THERE IS A FIRST. WE WILL FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE AS OUTLINED IN OUR- RULES OF ORDER AND YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK I PROMISE YOU ART PRESS EIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. TO IMPOSE A NEW VEHICLE FUEL WINDFALL PROFITS TAX ON GASOLINE SUPPLIER GROSS RECEIPTS WHEN THE PRICE OF A GAS GALLON OF GASOLINE IS ABNORMALLY HIGH COMPARED TO THE PRICE OF A BARREL OF CRUDE OIL THREE REQUIRED THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO DETERMINE TAX A TAX RATE THAT WOULD COVER ANY GASOLINE SUPPLIES PROFIT MARGIN THAT EXCEEDS. A THIRTY CENTSPER GALLON FOR REQUIRED THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO DETERMINE THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROFIT MARGIN FIVE ESTABLISH A NEW VEHICLE FUEL WINDFALL REBATE FUND AND REQUIRE THE WINDFALL TAX DOLLARS TO BE PAID TO THAT FUND SIX REQUIRED THAT THE FUNDS TO BE PAID BACK CALIFORNIA GASOLINE PURCHASERS VIAA REBATES SEVEN REQUIRE THE FRANCHISE TAX OR TO ESTABLISH HOW TO RE DISTRIBUTE THAT REBATE. AND EIGHT REQUIRED THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND CC CONSULT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THOSE ARE AMENDMENTS MANAGER. OKAY I ALREADY WITHDREW THE MOTION SO. IT WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY TO SECOND.

THREE NINE THREE NINE THAT MOTION FAILS NOW WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MOTION BUT ON BOTH LEVELS FROM THE BILL. MADAM CHAIR MAY MAY I ASK- WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE AMENDMENTS AND PRINT IS THERE A WAY THAT. THE PAYMENTS ARE AVAILABLE ARE THE AMENDMENTS AVAILABLE TO BE SHOWN TO THE MEMBERS I THINK WE PRUDENT BEFORE WE VOTE ON. THIS THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE THE AMENDMENTS AND PRINT. AND THAT'S PURSUE AFTER MY PHONE THAT'S PURSUANT TO RULE SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE. I REQUEST. THE MINISTRY PLACEMENT IN THE MOMENTS IN PRINT. I'M. THE OFF THE AUTHOR OF THE AMENDMENTS IS OFFERING TO PROVIDE THE AMENDMENTS AND WRITING BUT WE WILL HAVE TO RECESSES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOU THAT'S WHY A WILL CRAPPIE TO RECESS. THIS IS YOUR GOVERNMENT FOLKS RIGHT HERE. ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL. RIGHT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GOING TO PASS TEMPORARILY ON THIS ITEM WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THE HEARING WITH OTHER BILLS TO GIVE MISTER LEE'S STOP A CHANCE TO BRING DOWN BY HIS SUBSTITUTE- OF HIS AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AND SO WE WILL PASS TEMPORARILY AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT BILL WHILE WE MAKE THAT. WHILE WE FOR FILLED MR FONG'S REQUEST THANK YOU. FOR THE PEOPLE. OUR NEXT BILL IS AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO BY MISTER BENNETT I SEE THE AUTHOR IN ATTENDANCE AND SIR YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR OF AS WE OF ALL FROM A FOSSIL FUEL ECONOMY I BELIEVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIANS WILL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF WE HAVE A HEALTHY COMPETITION BETWEEN HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AND ELECTRIC BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. I BELIEVE AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TO HELP ADVANCE THIS GOAL. THERE'S BEEN A STEADY EFFORT BY SOME TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS APPROVED AND FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT SENSE GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THOSE EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WE HAVE STAYED AT SIMPLY TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS CURRENTLY THERE ARE ONLY TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS THAT ARE ASSURED BY THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE. AND BUDGET FUNDING. THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS STATED THAT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED. MAY ALREADY BE ENCUMBERED IN SOME WAY AND ONLY THIRTEEN OF THEM. CAN SERVICE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. AN EXPANDING DEMAND FOR HYDROGEN BY PORTS AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS WILL BE A VALUABLE STIMULUS FOR US TO MAKE GREEN ELECTROLYSIS HYDROGEN MORE COST EFFECTIVE. AND I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE GREEN HYDROGEN IS THE KEY FOR HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY TO BECOME TRULY A COMPETITIVE FUEL ALTERNATIVE FUEL AS WE TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS. CONTENTIONS THAT LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES CANNOT SAFELY FUEL ITS STATIONS THAT SERVICE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS IS SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE. DIESEL LIGHT DUTY CARS AND FUELED SAFELY AT TRUCK STOPS FOR DECADES. HI MYSELF ONLY DIESEL RABBIT FORTY YEARS AGO AND FUEL REGULARLY AT TRUCK STOPS ROVER TEN YEARS. THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY THAT HYDROGEN HAS MANY VALUABLE BENEFITS FOR HEAVY DUTY SHIPPING. EVERY DUTY TRANSPORT AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKING THIS BILL DOES NOT DOWNGRADE THE EFFORT FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO BE SURE THAT WE GET THE MAXIMUM VALUE FROM THE TAXPAYERS INVESTMENT IN HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS. AT LEAST USE THE FEW REMAINING STATIONS TO GET STARTED ON THE MINIMUM HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS NEEDED TO ATTRACT MORE INVESTMENT. IN THE CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE NOBODY WANTS TO BUY HYDROGEN TRUCKS IF THERE ARE FUELING STATIONS NOBODY WANTS TO BUILD A FUELING STATIONS IF WE DON'T HAVE THE TRUCKS. AND HELP HYDROGEN LAUNCH SO IT CAN COMPETE ON ITS OWN WITHOUT FUTURE SUBSIDIES AFTER THE INITIAL START UP INVESTMENT THAT MARKET ECONOMIES ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE TO DO. THE SOLVE THIS CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM SO THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. UP AND ON THE LINE TO TEST A FIRE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PORT OF HUENEME ME. THANK YOU- OPERATOR WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES BY PHONE TRIALS PETA FOR AN ADAM IF YOU GOT IF YOU CAN FIND THEM FOR TWO MINUTES APIECE THANK YOU. CHILD SUPPORT WE'RE HERE. GO AHEAD PLEASE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON BEHALF OF THE OXNARD HARBOR DISTRICT IN THE QUARTER ONE EVENING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED TESTIMONY MY NAME IS HILD CREDIT FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER FOR THE PORT WHY NINI I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHTS INTO THE PORTS APPROACH FOR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. FIRST JUST SOME QUICK BACKGROUND WE ARE THE ONLY DEEP WATER COMMERCIAL SEAPORT BETWEEN LA AND SAN FRANCISCO IN SERVICE A CRITICAL LINK FOR AGRICULTURAL AND AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS BOTH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE A TOP TEN U. S. PORK BUT REFRIGERATED CONTAINERS AND AUTOMOBILES. THE PORT IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE BRIGHTEST SHINING STAR IN THE VENTURA COUNTY ECONOMY AND WHILE THE REST OF THE COUNTY GDP HAS STAGNATED. SUPPORTED SUCCEEDED IN GROWING ITS CARGO THROUGHPUT. IT'S BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY. ALL WHILE REDUCING ITS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ON SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS IN THE PORT HAVE DECREASED BY ALMOST 80% AND IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR OR BOARD OF HARBOR COMMISSIONERS APPROVED A RESOLUTION COMMITTING THE PORT TO A FUTURE OF ZERO MISSION OPERATIONS. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE COURT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING A LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM AND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONSTRUCTED A HIGH VOLTAGE SYSTEM ALLOWING OCEAN GOING VESSEL TO PLUG INTO QUEEN CREEK POWER WELL DOCTOR. SHORE POWER PROJECT HAS SHOWN INCREDIBLE BENEFITS IN REDUCING AIR QUALITY IMPACTS AND THE COURT IS CONTINUING THIS ELECTRIFICATION WITH THE INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO POWER. OTHER PIECES OF HEAVY DUTY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING YOUR TRACTORS CRANES AND TUGBOAT. IN OUR TEN YEARS OF OPERATING THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE CHALLENGES OF TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS GO BEYOND THE EQUIPMENT ITSELF. AND THAT THE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND MOST CRITICAL PIECES OF THE PUZZLE. WE SEE OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE AS ONE THAT RECOGNIZES THIS INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGE AND ADDRESSES IT THROUGH CAREFULLY ENGINEERED INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. BITING BOTH LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY IMPROVEMENTS IN THINGS LIKE CLEAN GREEN HYDROGEN AS WELL AS- CLEAN GRID POWER. FROM THE STANDPOINT THE BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED A ZERO EMISSION FUTURE FOUNDED IN THE COURTS WILL HELP BE PROVIDED BY THIS LEGISLATION AND ALLOW FOR THE EVOLUTION OF LOCAL PROJECTS. THAT CAN ACCELERATE INNOVATION ALL WHILE REDUCING EMISSIONS AT THE SAME TIME AND OUR PORT COMMUNITIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO MADAM BAKER ON BEHALF OF THE OSCAR HARBOR DISTRICT REPORTED BY NAMING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS TESTIMONY ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SIX TWO. MY NAME IS ADAM BEGA AMBIK MEDIA OUTREACH SPECIALIST FOR THE PORT WHY NINI REPORTED RECENTLY BEGAN AN IN DEPTH TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF ENERGY SUPPLIES TO OPERATE WITH ZERO EMISSIONS WE SEE THE NEED FOR A COMBINATION OF THE EASTFIELD TECHNOLOGY IN THAT BATTERY ELECTRIC WILL NOT BE THE RIGHT FUEL FOR EVERY APPLICATION. THE QUICKNESS LIKE SHIPS IN LONG HAUL TRUCKING WILL BE BETTER SERVED BY FEEL LIKE GREEN HYDROGEN THIS REPORT TENER DISTRIBUTION NETWORK POWERED BY GREEN HYDROGEN IN CRITICAL LOCATIONS LIKE THE COURT OF ARMENIAN WILL ENABLE THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO BE ACHIEVED MORE QUICKLY AND WITH GREATER BENEFITS OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY. THE OXNARD REGION OF THE NUMBER SMALL. THAT A SYSTEM OF SUPPLY CHAIN PROCESS. SUCH AS TRUCKING COMPANIES AND OTHER SMALL MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES. THESE COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE THE BAND WITH THE TIME OR THE EXPERTISE TO PURSUE INCENTIVE FUNDS ARE TRANSITIONING THEIR EQUIPMENT. ADDITIONALLY AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY DO NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED THE POWER CLEAN EQUIPMENT. MANY OF THESE INDEPENDENTLY OWNED TRUCKS ARE DRIVEN HOME AT THE END OF THE DAY. ARE PARKED IN FRONT OF A HOME. PHONE SURE AN EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT COMMUNITY LIKE OXNARD. AND PORT HUENEME ME ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. ACCESS TO INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR EQUIPMENT PLUS THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENABLING THE UTILIZATION. OF A REGIONAL CLEAN ENERGY HUB MICHAEL GREEN HYDROGEN FUEL IN CENTER WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THOSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE HAD. THE LEAST ACCESS TO CLEAN ENERGY OPPORTUNITY WILL BE GIVEN EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE OF INTER COUNTIES CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. ADDITIONALLY WE SEE A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY TO HELP REINVIGORATE THE HOLLY MIDDLE CLASS OF INTER COUNTY WITH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND JOB TRAINING. FOCUSED AROUNDA CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE FOR VENTURA COUNTY. WE ALL KNOW THE VENTURA COUNTY HISTORICALLY HAD A THRIVING POSSIBILITY STRUCTURE INDUSTRY. WE FEEL THE TIME HAS COME AND URGENTLY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS TO BEGIN GROWING THE CLEAN ENERGY INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTY OF VENTURA. AND THIS BILL ONE ABLE GREEN HYDROGEN TO BE CENTRAL TO THAT TRANSITION FOR SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS. IN OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY WE FEEL AS THOUGH GREEN HYDROGEN MUST BE THE ONLY OPTION RELATED TO HIGH DEMAND FIELDS GREY AND BLUE HYDROGEN DO NOT MEET THE STANDARDS OF SUSTAINABILITY. BUT THE PORT WILL REQUIRE AT THE STEWARD OF A VERY UNIQUE AND VERY SPECIAL CONCERN BY MEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE NOW TO THE OPPOSITE TO OPPOSITION WE HAVE FIRST UP- SOMEBODY IN PERSON FROM THE CULT FROM WE HAVE TO RESET A- COOK FROM A CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION. WELCOME. MIKE YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE I'M MAY I TROUBLE ONE OF THE SERGEANTS TO PASS OUT A DOCUMENT BEFORE I. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT GRACE TURN MEMBERS TERESA KOK HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION IT IS SINCERELY WITH A HEAVY HEART THAT I COME HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION- OF THE LETTERS THAT ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO YOU NOW IS A COALITION OF MORE THAN THIRTY HYDROGEN AFFILIATES THAT HAVE SEEN AND REJECTED THIS PROPOSAL BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND WHILE I DON'T SPEAK FOR ALL OF THEM HERE TODAY I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS PROCEEDING ACTIVELY HAPPENING AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THAT YOU ARE. AWARE OF THESE CONCERNS AND- ALL JOB RIGHT AND I WOULD OFFER THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY AND HARMFUL TO A MARKET THAT IS STILL TRYING TO FIND ITS FOOTING IN CALIFORNIA AS ARE A TERRIFIC BUDGET STAFF HAVE NOTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TEN BILLION DOLLAR AYE PROPOSAL LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR 62% OF THOSE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND VEHICLE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO HEAVY DUTY SO I WOULD OFFER TO THIS COMMITTEE WE DO NOT HAVE A HEAVY DUTY FUNDING PROBLEM WE HAVE A HYDROGEN ALLOCATION PROBLEM AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. OF THE MORE THAN SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT IS BEING PUT FORWARD TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY BEARD THROUGH THE STATE OR ARE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR SETTLEMENTS WITH COMPANIES LIKE ENERGY AND VOLKSWAGEN. THREE POINT 7% OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING DIRECTED TOWARD HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO AGAIN I WOULD OFFER WE DO NOT HAVE A HEAVY DUTY FUNDING PROBLEM WE HAVE AN ALLOCATION PROBLEM IN THE STATE. WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT HELPING BE HEAVY DUTY NETWORK BY OBLITERATING IT LIGHT AND MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. SWITCHING GEARS VERY QUICKLY WHO DOES THIS PROPOSAL HARM THIS PROPOSAL HARMS THE 40% OF CALIFORNIANS THAT LIVE IN APARTMENT COMPLEXES WHERE CHARGING INSTALLATION IS GOING TO BE. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD DELAYED AND NOT DEVELOPED IN AMOUNT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEED THE 13% OF SUPER COMMUTERS THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE LENGTHY COMMUTES TO AND FROM WORK EVERY SINGLE DAY. ALSO OUR MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES THEIR RESOURCES BOARD SCOPING PLANS INITIAL- ESTIMATES FIND THAT IN THE MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLE CLASS MORE THAN 50% OF THESE VEHICLES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FUEL CELL THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE REFUELING AT THE PORT OF LA OR LONG BEACH THEY NEED THESE I HAVEN'T. PASSENGER VEHICLE STATIONS THAT WERE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH AND I'M SORRY YOUR OVER THE TIME I'M SURE. THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY ALSO A VOTE FOR THIS BILL IS PUTTING UP ANOTHER BARRIER TO THE TRANSITION OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY INTO HYDROGEN- AND AGAIN ALL THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS MOST INTERESTED IN PROTECTING IN THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE DISCUSSION. IS HARMED BY THIS BILL THANK YOU CHAIR FOR YOUR GRACE THANK YOU AND WE DO HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER IN OPPOSITION- THEY ARE ON THE PHONE- IT IS SERAPH AT SEVEN OPERATOR IF YOU CAN PLEASE FIND MISS FITZSIMMONS. HELLO I'M AVAILABLE FOR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS SEARCH THE PLAN IN THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COUNCIL A TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO COMMERCIALIZE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN ACROSS THE ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION SPACE BECAUSE I LIKE TO START BY THICKENING EVERYTHING THAT TREAT THE COOK IT'S SAD BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE TIME WHERE HYDROGEN SHOULD BE UNITED WERE AS WE ARE WITH CHD. AND NOT DIVIDED WE SHOULD ALL BE WORKING TOWARDS IMPROVING OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO BE DECARBONISE DEMETER AIR QUALITY GOALS AND WE CAN'T BE DOING THAT IF WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION CAME OUT LIGHT DUTY OF COVERED FOR HYDROGEN REFUELING I'M A FUEL CELL ELECTRIC FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVER MYSELF AND I'M TELLING YOU THE ACCESS TO STATIONS IS CRITICAL FOR LIGHT DUTY DRIVERS. THE IDEA THAT HEAVY DUTY THE ONLY STATE WITH HYDROGEN IS THAT CORRECT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MEMBERS IN HEAVY DUTY THAT WE FULLY SUPPORT FUNDING FOR HEAVY DUTY STATION BUT THE VERY SEPARATE POCKET THAT NEEDS TO REMAIN FUNDED AND FUNDED WITH PARITY AT THE COMPARED TO BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE LIGHT DUTY SIDE IT IS THERE'S NO PARITY WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE. THAT'S CHARGING THEIR VEHICLES ON THE GRID AND THE GREATEST ON AVERAGE ONLY 33% RENEWABLE WHERE YOU LOOK AT ALL THE HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AVAILABLE MAJORITY ARE AVAILABLE TO LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD FUND WHICH REQUIRES THEM TO BE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RENEWABLE FUELAND MAJORITY OF THOSE STATIONS ARE 90% RENEWABLE OR GREATER. THE TO START GIVING FUND FOR THE BATTERY ELECTRIFIED FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES WERE ON AVERAGE IS ONLY 33% RENEWABLE WILL REALLY NOT BEATING OUR DECARBONISATION AIR QUALITY GOALS THE DISCUSSION SAYING BUT LIKE IF HE IS FUNDED IS NOT CORRECT CALIFORNIANS NEED ANOTHER OPTION FOR THEIR MISSION VEHICLES THAT REQUIRE THAT REQUIRE LONG RANGE OPTIONS SHORT REFUELLING AND ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A DIVERSITY IN OPTIONS FOR GREITENS TO BE PLEASE. RECOMMEND A NO VOTE AMONG THE MEN DID BECAUSE WE DO SUPPORT FUELING AIRPORTS WE DO IDENTIFY THE COMMUNITIES NEAR THE PORT NEED AN OPTION TO PUT FORTY SHILLINGS. NEAR COURT NOT AT WORK. BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SAFE FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES ARE GOING TO BE. LOCATION AT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I HOPE THAT YOU. WHAT AMENDED THAT TELL NEAR. OF BE A CO ITSELF THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE'RE TO A TESTIMONY FOR OREGON HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM. SEEING NOBODY. IN PER TO TEST OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN UP THE PHONES FOR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION FOR AB. TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON AB TWENTY FIVE SIX TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN THEY ARE AT THIS TIME. AND WE'LL START WITH LINE THREE SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. OKAY THE DROPPED OUT OF Q. ONE THREE SEVENTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THREE SEVENTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON KNOWING HOW TO RECHARGE IT. NINE THREE SEVENTY SIX WE GOT. GARY YES PLEASE GO AHEAD HI SIR I'M GONNA I'M GONNA DIFFER ON THE- THE CURRENT BILL THANK YOU. LINE THREE NINETY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL PIMENTEL OF THE HALF OF THE PACIFIC MERCHANT SHIPPING ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. NINE ONE SEVENTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES HI MY NAME IS JONATHAN PARKER SANDRA ON THE OFFICE REDSHIRTING WE ARE IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL THANK YOU AHEAD. I AM IN OPPOSITION A. B. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT I MEAN I'M IN SUPPORT AT SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THAT TO REMOVE THE GAS OKAY THIS IS THE WRONG OPERATOR PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE CORRECT PEOPLE FOR THE CORRECT BILL IN Q. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NINE ONE NINETY TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS STEVE WITH A TWO ZERO WOULD BE OPERATE PIALA LARGEST NETWORK OF HYDROGEN STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. IT DOES NOT CONSIDER THE PROPER PLACEMENT OF STATIONS FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND WE SUPPORT HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THEIR APPROACH TO THE STATE WILL BE CRITICAL BUT THEY DSERVE THEIR OWN FUNDING STREAM. THAT IS ALREADY- EFFORT UNDERWAY FOR THAT TODAY BUT TO TAKE MONEY FROM THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE WRONG WAY TO DO IT. TRYING TO NINETY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. IT GABRIELLE INGRAM I AM IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. ONE SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD COUNTY. ONE FOUR ZERO TWO GO AHEAD. FOUR ZERO TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. FOUR ZERO TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. FIND ONE EIGHTEEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. YEAH HI MY NAME'S STEVEN MACKINTOSH I'M A FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DRIVER HERE IN SANTA BARBARA CALIFORNIA AND MANAGING PARTNER OF HYDROGEN POWER PARTNERS AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO. NINE THREE SEVENTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. AFTER MY PRIDE PLASTER COUNTY NO ON AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO THANK YOU. NINE THREE SIXTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD FIVE SIX TWO THANK YOU. THE MANAGER WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE DISCUSSION NOW TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS BILL FOR THE PHONE NUMBERS MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK THIS IS A QUESTION FOR. THE OPPOSITION I SHARE THE CONCERN THAT WE ARE UNDER FUNDING HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE RELATIVE TO OTHER FORMS OF ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLES- I THINK HYDROGEN HAS TO BE PART OF THE ANSWER ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. POLLING THINGS HEAVY PAYLOADS SHIPPING SIMPLY BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF THE BATTERIES FOR EV'S BECOMES OF. ENGINEERING PROBLEM RIGHT. SO I'M I TOTALLY GET THE WILL OR NOT FUNDING THIS WELL ENOUGH AND THE AUTHOR PUT IT WELL WHEN HE SAID WE HAVE A CHECK OR A PROBLEM I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. BUT AS I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL. THIS IS SAYING OKAY WE'VE GOT A- GIVEN PART OF MONEY THAT'S FINITE. AND WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE A TO PROJECTS. LOCATED AT PORTS WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU GOT A SHIP. IN THE INLAND FROM A PORT. OF FUELING STATIONS THAT SERVE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT'S WERE HYDROGENS THE MOST. EFFICACIOUS AND PROJECTS ALONG FEDERALLY DESIGNATED OR STATE DESIGNATED. OF GOODS MOVEMENT HIGHWAYS WHICH MAKES SENSE TO ME AS WELL SO I GUESS MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH ASKING TO PRIORITIZE THINGS AND IN THAT WAY IT SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL SEQUENCE TO ME GIVEN WE HAVE THIS FINITE CONCERN OR IT'S PERFECTLY VALID ANSWER THAT WE JUST NEED MORE MONEY GOING INTO HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. A STATEMENT WITH WHICH I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION ASSEMBLY MAN I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH- YOU KNOW THREE POINT 7% OF FUNDING BEING DIRECTED TOWARD HYDROGEN AND THIS MOM AND I'M TRYING TO FIND FUEL ECONOMY AND WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING- IN EUROPE AND OURS THEIR MISSION VEHICLE SEEMS A LITTLE. ABSURD SO I DO THINK THERE IS A NEED TO REALLY TRY TO LOOK AT WIDE ARE FUNDING PERCENTAGES ARE. BUT THEN ALSO I WILL SAY THAT I'D AS IT RELATES TO THE LIGHT DUTY MARKET YOU HAVE AT LEAST THREE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS WITH COMMERCIALIZED VEHICLES FOR SALE ON THE ROAD NOW AND WE DON'T WANT TO PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THEM IN AN EXPECTATION. OF A STATE WIDE FUELING NETWORK THEY CAN SERVICE THOSE VEHICLES. SECOND THING THAT I WOULD OFFER THAT I THINK SOMETIMES GETS LOST IN THIS SPACE IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE CLASS THREE TO CLASS SIX TRUCKS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BOX TRUCKS VANS AT CETERA. THE IDEA THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE GOING TO RE FUEL AT THE PORT OR AT THE FREEWAY INNER CHANGE DOESN'T REALLY ACCURATELY OFF REFLECT WHAT MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES ARE DOING ON THE ROAD THEY ARE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE GOING TO PROJECTS THEIR REFUELLING AT THE CORNER GAS STATION THAT YOU AND I USE FOR A PASSENGER VEHICLES. AND SO YOU'VE GOT ON ONE HAND THERE RESOURCES BOARD MAKING STATEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND CALLING FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO DEPEND ON THESE VEHICLES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME OUR INVESTMENT IN THE FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF. IS NOT AT ALL ON PACE WITH WHITES IN A REGULATORS ARE SAYING WILL BE AVAILABLE. THAT HELPS ANSWER. ANYWAY MISTER BUMP WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK IT IT TO. ASSAM IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND I AYE I- THINK OF MISTER BENNETT YOU KNOW- THAT- WE SEE EYE TO EYE ON- THE EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT OF- A GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE STATE IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT- PRIORITY WE ARE- HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD ON SOME OF THAT- FUNDING FOR GREEN HYDROGEN IN THE BUDGET- THIS YEAR- BUT WE REALLY COULD USE A LOT MORE THAN OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD I THINK OR JUMPING AHEAD OF US. OFF ON THAT- I ALSO SUPPORT THE GOAL OF EXPANDING MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY- A HYDROGEN VEHICLES AND THEIR ACCESS TO FUEL- I THINK THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BUT MIKE MY CONCERN WITH THE BILL AND THE REASON I'M GONNA. LAY OFF TODAY IS THAT I THINK THAT IT- THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN. I'M IS GOING TO DRAW MONEY AWAY FROM THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR. ALL I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION AT LEAST AS YOU KNOW WE'VE TO DISCUSS THE- OTHER BILL THAT'S NOT YOUR INTENTION- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU'VE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE TO TRY AND- AVOID THAT- THAT THAT OUTCOME. BUT I THINK- AS- HAS BEEN HURT THIS AFTERNOON THAT. WE YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT'S BEEN EXPRESSED- THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY. CONSCIENTIOUS ABOUT- NOT HURTING THAT SECTOR OF THE HYDROGEN. MARKET THIS IS A- COMPLICATED WEB OF FUNDING- IN MY VIEW IT'S BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR- FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND THAT IS LEADING TO- OF THIS CONFLICT OVER WHO'S GONNA GET THE FEW DOLLARS. THAT OF THAT THAT THAT ARE AVAILABLE- I WISH THAT WEREN'T THE CASE BUT- YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS IS THAT- A COMPETITION OVER. SCARCE DOLLARS AND- I THINK IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE. TO PRIORITIZE THE UC LAKE VEHICLE MARKET IT- AS HAS BEEN SAID THERE'S BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF IN. VESTMENT IN THAT SECTOR AND- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NETWORK IS BUILT THAT WILL SERVICE THE VEHICLES. THAT MANUFACTURERS ARE WILLING TO PRODUCE THAT SAID AGAIN I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT I DO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF THE MEDIUM. AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR AND SO THERE'S LOTS OF WORK TO BE DONE THERE TOO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO HERE- AND- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO. DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU. OKAY- ANY OTHER COMMENTS BEFORE WE LET THE AUTHOR CLOSE. OKAY SEE NONE MISTER BENNETT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD AND IF IT IF IT WITH THE CHAIRS INTELLIGENCE- I WOULD LIKE TO RESTORE AND I HAD PLEASE RESPOND TO SOME OF THESE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE JUST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE VERY MANY OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN AS A GROUP TALK ABOUT- IT IMPORTANT LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF AND MAKE A NUMBER OF POINTS NUMBER ONE AS YOU SAID THE WORLD IS AHEAD OF US IN TERMS OF HYDROGEN SO I AGREE WE'RE NOT MAKING A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH COMMITMENT TO HYDROGENSO AS A MISTER CUNNINGHAM JUST POINTED OUT- HE WANTS AND I THINK VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY HERE WANTS MORE FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN AS MANY AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S AN INTERESTING THING FOR SHOULD BE AWARE OF IN THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE CALL FOR THE HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS THAT THEN GOVERNOR BROWN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TOOK TO TWO HUNDRED. IT DOESN'T DEFINE WHAT KIND OF HYDROGEN STATION BUILDER JUST SAYS PUBLIC. JUST AS PUBLIC FUELING STATIONS NOW IF IT'S AS JUST PUBLIC FUELING STATIONS AND YET THERE HAS BEEN I THINK AT A SENSE THAT DOES ALL HAVE TO BE LIGHT DUTY AND THAT'S IN FACT VIRTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY HAVE BECOME LIGHT DUTY EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NO- THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE LIGHT DUTY AND IT'S JUST SIMPLY THE INTERPRETATION. OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO OF SAID HEY PUBLIC PROBABLY MEANS LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY THEY THEY HAVE MOVED THAT DIRECTION I WITH THAT SO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I'VE HEARD HERE THAT I THINK IS A MISSTATEMENT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE IS. THIS TAKES MONEY AWAY FROM LIGHT DUTY. IF THIS PROPOSAL ROLLS OUT THE WAY I THINK IT SHOULD. THERE SHOULD BE THE SAME NUMBER OF LIGHT DUTY STATIONS. WITH THIS OR WITHOUT THIS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS. PERHAPS TWENTY OF THEM WILL BE LIGHT DUTY STATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY STATIONS. THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THE DEATH KNELL FOR. LIGHT DUTY STATIONS IF THEY HAVE A STENCH OF BILLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED IT'S JUST A SMALL NUMBER THAT WOULD THEN. HAVE BOTH BUT IT WOULD SEND A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING THE MINIMUM INVESTMENT IN HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT WE CAN ALSO LAUNCH IN THAT SECTOR AS WELL AS LAUNCHING LIGHT DUTY WE HAVE AT LEAST MADE SOME MINIMUM INVESTMENT. EVERYBODY HERE ARE MANY PEOPLE HERE INCLUDING MYSELF WOULD LIKE IT TO BE LARGER. THANK THAT THE LIGHT DUTY- MARKET IS GOING TO GO FASTER THAN WHAT A. R. B. AS IS- SUGGESTING WHAT CC IS MAKING THEIR DECISIONS ON. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO REMEMBER IS THAT C. ECT ENERGY COMMISSION IS THE DECISION MAKER. ON HOW MANY LIGHT DUTY STATIONS ARE GONNA BE OUT THERE. AND THEY HAVE STATED OVER AND OVER TWO HUNDRED IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. FOR THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS. AND EVERY EFFORT TO TRY TO GO BEYOND THAT HAS FAILED. SO AS A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE SAID WE HAVE A LIMITED RESOURCE THE ONLY THING WE'RE SURE OF IS THERE'S GOING TO BE TWO HUNDRED. THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS IF THERE'S ONLY GONNA BE TWO HUNDRED AND WE'VE ALREADY BUILT A LOT OF LIGHT DUTY SHOULD WE HAVE SOME OF THEM. BE BOTH LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY AT THE SAME TIME. SHOULDN'T THEY BE LOOK AT JUST I THINK IT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT WITH THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF MONEY NOW THEN WE CAN ALL GO OUT. AND AS I'VE EVER HAD SAID TO SOME OF YOU WE CAN ALL GO OUT AND WHEN YOU HAVE. A HEAVY DUTY. INFRASTRUCTURE MOVING FORWARD AND HEAVY DUTY INDUSTRY INVOLVED THEY WILL BE PARTNERS. IN PUSHING FOR GREEN. HYDROGEN TO MOVE FORWARD I REALLY WELCOME THE FACT IT IS VERY RARE BUT YOU HEARD THE PORT OF HUENEME ME TESTIFIED TODAY. THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO GOING A 100% GREEN HYDROGEN YOU DON'T HAVE INDUSTRY SAYING THAT TO US VERY OFTEN. THAT'S THE PARTNERSHIP THAT LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. SO FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER THE FACT THAT- STATEMENTS LIKE OBLITERATE THE LIGHT DUTY. VEHICLE MARKET. IS VERY HE HAS IS THAT OVER STATEMENT RELATIVE TO WHERE WE ARE. NO ONE'S GOING TO GO TO THE PORCH TO FUEL UP AS IF THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN FUEL UP HERE BY GOING TO A PART. OF IT AND- SO. I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE YOU HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUBSTANTIALLY HAS LOCKED US AT THE TWO HUNDRED WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THOSE TWO HUNDRED. I THINK COMMON SENSE SAYS AT LEAST SOME OF THEM SHOULD BE. HEAVY DUTY MEDIUM DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME YEAH GO ON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS PASSION ABOUT THIS I HAVE TO JUST CONFESSED TO ALL OF YOU THAT. ONE I FLY FROM BURBANK ON MONDAY MORNINGS USUALLY MISTER BENNETT IS SITTING ON THE AIRPLANE NEXT TO ME. AND ALMOST EVERY TIME AS SOON AS WE SIT DOWN HE TURNS TO ME AND SAYS CAN I TALK TO FOR A FEW MINUTES ABOUT HYDROGEN. US SO THIS IS WHAT HE HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT NONSTOP. ALL YOU YEAR AND LAST YEAR. ADDED SOMETHING THAT HE'S VERY COMMITTED TO AND VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG SUBJECT. AND A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CLEAN VEHICLE. THE COMMITMENT IN CALIFORNIA ARE ABOUT HOW WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S SUCH A HUGE PART OF MAKING SURE. THAT PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH IN TRANSITIONING TO CLEAN VEHICLES. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE. AND SOME OF OUR MOST POLLUTING VEHICLES ARE THOSE BIG CLASS EIGHT TRUCKS IN OUR DRAYAGE TRUCKS. AND OUR PORT CORRIDORS ARE ECONOMIC JUSTICE. AND THOSE HEALTH IMPACTS FOR YEARS SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR. AND HIS COMMITMENT NOT ONLY TO MAKING SURE WE FOCUS ON THOSE FOR THE MOST QUARTERS KNOWS VEHICLES. BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T STOP THE- ADAPTATION OF HYDROGEN WITH PASSENGER VEHICLES AND I THINK HE'S REALLY TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE HERE. AND WORKING WITH OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES IN DOING THAT. AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN TERMS OF THAT WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE THAT UP TO. OUR AGENCIES TO FIGURE OUT A HUNDRED PERCENT. NOW I KNOW THAT HE'S COMMITTED TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT HE WILL. CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THIS.

BECAUSE WE ARE WAITING FOR AUTHORS WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER WARD FROM AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY MR WARD YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY. LOCAL BRIDGES ARE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY CONNECTS RESIDENTS TO JOBS SCHOOLS CLINICS GROCERY STORES RETAIL STORES AND EVERYTHING YOU LOVE DOING JOINT. AT THE CURRENT RATE OF FUNDING THE PERCENTAGE OF LOCAL BRIDGES DOESN'T NEED US POOR CONDITION UNDERFEDERAL STANDARDS WILL INCREASE FROM 11% AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY TACKLE THIS PROBLEM HEAD ON BY ADJUSTING THE FUNDING FORMULA 255% WHICH ALLOCATES APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND YOU HAVE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT. THERE YOU ARE HELLO WELCOME. NOW WE'RE ON GREAT BUT TRY TO BE BRIEF SINCE YOU'VE HAD A LONG MEETING ALREADY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR FREEMEN AND MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BONNIE GORE AND I SERVE ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND PLASTER COUNTY I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN MY ROLE AS VICE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION POLICY COMMITTEE. C. SACK AS A PROUD SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD THIS IMPORTANT BILL WOULD ENSURE A FAIR AND NEEDS BASED ALLOCATION ABRIDGE FORMULA FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY WOULD ALLOCATE A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF NEW FEDERAL BRIDGE FUNDS TO HELP CLOSE THE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP FOR LOCAL BRIDGE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT PROJECTS STATEWIDE. IN TWENTY TWENTY COUNTIES AND CITIES REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES AND CALTRANS FUNDED A STATEWIDE LOCAL BRIDGE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. REPORT USED INSPECTION DATA DETERMINE THE NEED FOR BRIDGE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT PROJECTS AND ANALYZE THE IMPACTS OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SCENARIOS. JUST A FEW OF THE KEY FINDING FINDINGS INCLUDE THAT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED LOCAL BRIDGES NEED TO BE REPAIRED. AND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY ONE OR SO DETERIORATED THAT THEY MUST BE REPLACED. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN THE CONDITION OF STATE AND LOCAL BRIDGES. ELEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF LOCAL BRIDGES ARE IN POOR CONDITION COMPARED TO ONLY THREE POINT 3% OF STATE BRIDGES. WITH THESE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE FUNDING FORMULA. IT WOULD INCREASE THE FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE TO LOCAL BRIDGES FROM APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO APPROXIMATELY EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS INCREASE IN FUNDING WOULD ADDRESS AN ACUTE NEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN MY OWN COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE APPROXIMATELY 25% OF COUNTY MAINTAIN BRIDGES ARE IN FAIR OR POOR CONDITION AND NEED TO BE REPAIRED OR REPLACED. OUR COUNTY IS CURRENTLY PURSUING FUNDING FOR SEVEN BRIDGE PROJECTS AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF A HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR EXAMPLE THE FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR WHYTE AVENUE BRIDGE REPLACEMENT PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A VITAL LINK BETWEEN THE COMMUNITIES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND EMERGING RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS OF PLASTER COUNTY. AND THEN AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM THE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR YANKEE JIM THIS BRIDGE REPLACEMENT WILL PROVIDE IMPROVE FIRE AND PUBLIC SAFETY ACCESS BETWEEN THE FOREST TELLING COLFAX COMMUNITIES. AND HELP ENSURE SAFE WILDFIRE EVACUATION EGRESS FOR THE PUBLIC. THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE READY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT BUT BUT DELAYED FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOCATED BY AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY. SO AB TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY ENSURES THAT LOCAL STATE LOCAL AND STATE BRIDGES BENEFIT FOR THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. REPAIRING OUR CRUMBLING TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE WELL PUTTING CALIFORNIANS TO WORK. COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WILL BENEFIT FROM THESE IMPORTANT FIX IT FIRST PROJECTS THAT CONNECT COMMUNITIES PROVIDE IMPORTANT EMERGENCY EVACUATION ROUTES AND ADDING SAFE ACCESS TO PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING. FOR THESE REASONS TO SEE SACK ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY. THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ANDREW ANTS WE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI OTHER SUPERVISOR LAID IT OUT VERY WELL SO I'M GOING TO EVER NOT TO REPEAT ANY POINTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE I'M GONNA TRUNCATE MY TESTIMONY. AND RECOGNITION OF THE LONG DAYS VERY I'LL JUST ADD THAT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS THIRTY SIX PRIORITY BRIDGES IN NEED OF REPAIR OR RECONSTRUCTION. CURRENT ESTIMATES BRING THE COST TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. A LOCAL BRIDGES ARE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. OF NETWORK AND THEY CONNECT MOTORISTS INCLUDING TRANSIT VEHICLES. TO JOBS SCHOOLS CLINICS AND ALL THE OTHER IMPORTANT DESTINATIONS IN DAILY LIFE. AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY POINTS OUT. REHABILITATING AND REPLACING THESE OLDER BRIDGES WOULD LIKELY ALLOW FOR. THE INSTALLATION OF SAFE ACCESS FOR BICYCLES AND PEDESTRIANS- AND THESE DOLLARS CAN BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE. UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO WITNESSES REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO TEST MONEY FOR OR AGAINST THE BILL HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM YOU CAN COME UP AND STATE YOUR NAME IN YOUR POSITION.

KALRA I LEE ME I BLEW BLOOM I NAZARIAN. WHEN I O'DONNELL O'DONNELL I WARD. WARD WARD I WICKS. MUNI. TWELVE ZERO ZERO THAT BILL IS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK NOW TO AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT NOW THAT MR LEE HAS GIVEN THE AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE WILL GO NOW TO DISCUSSION FROM THE COMMITTEE IF THERE'S ANY- YES MR TRUMP MR FONG. I THINK MEDICARE. LET'S BE CLEAR ON WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THE BILL TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE STATE'S GAS TAX FOR SIX MONTHS. PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF THE CALIFORNIANS IS BEING AND IS BEING SHOCKINGLY. TO RAISE TAXES EVEN MORE IN CALIFORNIA AND ON ENERGY OF ALL THINGS. THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FOR GASOLINE AND OTHER STATES AND THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THE DIFFERENCE. IS BECAUSE OF POLICY CHOICES INCLUDING TAXES AND STATE MANDATES THAT IS BEING IMPOSED IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT ANYWHERE ELSE. IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ENERGY MARKET AND WHY PRICES ARE GOING UP RIGHT NOW WITH THE UKRAINE. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE GOT INTO EXISTED BEFORE THE UKRAINIAN CONFLICT. IF YOUWANT TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF FOREIGN DEPENDENCE. OF OIL COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO LOOK OURSELVES IN THE MIRROR. WE ARE GROWING IN OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES COMING FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THIS BUILDING THIS LEGISLATURE. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES HAVE BEEN IMPOSED ON CALIFORNIA ENERGY PRODUCTION THAT IS INCREASED OUR ENERGY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 75% OF THE OIL THAT COMES INTO CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTED FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES ECUADOR SAUDI ARABIA IRAQ 6% OF THAT 75% SINCE LAST YEAR CAME FROM RUSSIA. EIGHTEEN MILLION BARRELS OF OIL CAME FROM RUSSIA THOUSANDS OF PERMITS. ARE SITTING BEFORE THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THAT WOULD ALLOW AN INCREASE IN OIL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ENERGY FOR CALIFORNIANS BY CALIFORNIANS BUT WHAT IS BEING DONE NOTHING. THE GOVERNOR IS DOING NOTHING AND SO OUR FOREIGN OIL DEPENDENCE IS GOING UP BECAUSE OF THAT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT FORMAL DEPENDENCE CALIFORNIA IS MORE VULNERABLE IT IS MORE AFFORDABLE. BECAUSE OF THE INSTABILITY IN THE ENERGY MARKET RIGHT NOW. SO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT ENERGY PRODUCTION I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DEBATE. LET'S PRODUCE ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT WHETHER CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO CONSUME ENERGY AND OIL AND IT IN OUR STATE THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS IT GONNA COME FROM. IS IT A IS IT LIKE IS IT GONNA COME FROM CALIFORNIA OR IS IT GONNA COME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. IN CALIFORNIA IS A ENERGY ISLAND PRODUCTION. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND BECAUSE OF TRANSPORTATION COSTS IT DOESN'T COME TO CALIFORNIA SO LET'S HAVE THE ENERGY DEBATE. BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE DISCUSSING HOW TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO CALIFORNIANS THAT IS A VERY CRUCIAL TIME. AND THESE AMENDMENTS. IMPOSE A NEW VEHICLE FUEL WINDFALL PROFITS TAX AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE END OF COURSE THERE'S IS BIG DEBATE ON ON WITH HOW THE PRICE OF OIL IS AT A PRICE OF GASOLINE IS DETERMINED. THE CDC HAS DONE THE ANALYSIS. THEY'VE DONE THE REPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S ASK FOR INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT JUSTICE HAS DONE AN INVESTIGATION. 51% OF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE COMES FROM THE STATE GAS TAX 80% COMES FROM. THE FEDERAL EXCISE TAX THEN YOU HAVE CAP AND TRADE THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD OVER A DOLLAR OF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE IN CALIFORNIA IS BECAUSE OF TAXES AND REGULATIONS. IT IS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT IF YOU COMPARE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE IN A CALIFORNIA TO OTHER STATES THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT. IT'S THE CALIFORNIA WAY THAT IS CAUSING THE PRICE OF OIL IF THE PRICE OF GASOLINE TO GO UP AND THAT THE PRICE OF ENERGY PRODUCTION TO GO UP AND WHY WE CAN'T PRODUCE. OIL DOMESTICALLY. OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT AS THIS AS MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY AS MENTIONED GEORGIA HAS SUSPENDED ITS TWENTY NINE CENT GAS TAX. CONNECTICUT AS PAT AS PASSED IN HAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ITS TWENTY FIVE CENT GAS TAX MARYLAND HAS TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ITS THREE CENT GAS TAX THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA. THIS IS A BIPARTISAN IDEA WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT YOU NASTY PASSED IN OTHER STATES. AND OF COURSE THE REBATE DEBATE AND WHAT THE WHAT THE OPPONENTS HAVE SAID. THE REAL GIVING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA VOTERS RIGHT NOW DRAKE TEMPERATE GAS EXPANSION IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE TO OTHER TAX RELIEF. WE AGREE WITH THE OPPONENTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THE AFFORDABLE A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS REAL IT'S NOT JUST GASOLINE IT'S HOUSING. ITS UTILITIES IT'S GROCERIES AND WE SHOULD LOOK OVER BUT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE OTHER POLICIES THAT HAVE CAUGHT INCREASE THE COST. OF ALL THOSE THINGS IN OUR STATE TAX RELIEF AN ACTUAL LOWER INCOME TAX RATES IN CALIFORNIA AND LOWER TAXES ON BUSINESSES SO THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY STAY IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT. BUSINESSES AND THAT CALIFORNIA'S THING CALIFORNIA. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THIS BILL THAT WAS GOING TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE GAS TAX RELIEF. TEMPORARILY COMPLETELY BACK FILLED BY THE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS IN OUR STATE EVIDENCE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA'S OVERTAXED BUT WHAT DOES THIS COMMITTEE WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IS IT TAKES A TAX RELIEF BILL INCREASES TAXES. THAT IS COMPLETELY. ASININE IT MAKES NO SENSE COMPLETELY NO SENSE. SO I AM ASKING FOR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE- THIS BILL THAT MISTER COLLEY HAS PRESENTED WAS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT NOW THIS BILL HAS BEEN AND NOW IT WILL INCREASE TAXES ON EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND EVERYONE IN THE PUBLIC EVERYONE WATCHING SHOULD BE. ASHAMED OF THIS PROCESS. WE NEED TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF. THE COMMON SENSE THING TO DO TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND THE STATE'S GAS TAX. SO THAT THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE RELIEF. NOT THIS WAITING ON WHAT IS GOING TO COME FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. I'M WAITING FOR THE DETAILS I EAGERLY AWAIT A DEBATE ON ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE THE TIME RIGHT NOW TO WAIT. SO I ASK FOR NO ABOUT. THANK YOU THE STATUS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M DISGUSTED BY THIS PROCESS. I KNOW I'M DOING HERE. BUT THIS IS A TRAVESTY OF PUBLIC POLICY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE ONE MEMBER OF A COMMITTEE OF FIFTEEN HAVE AMENDMENTS THAT ALMOST NOBODY HAS SEEN AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO VOTE ON THIS. THIS IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT A BILL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GO AHEAD AND CHANGE AND AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID. WE'RE HERE TO GIVE INSTANT RELIEF IF YOU COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE FROM THE MESSAGES AND ON THE RADIO IT'S ALRIGHT ON THE PHONE SAYING WE NEED HELP AND WE NEED HELP NOW. BUT WHAT YOU GONNA DO YOU'RE GONNA MAKE AMENDMENTS THAT WHO KNOWS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SIX MONTHS A YEAR. IS THAT GOING TO BE LONG ENOUGH TO THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP THEM THEN. SERIOUSLY I MEAN YOU HAVE TO HEAR THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE SAYING WE NEED HELP AND WE NEED IT NOW YOU CAN'T TURN. YOUR HEADS ON THIS. AND YET YOU'RE DOING THIS. OUR OUR BILL RIGHT HERE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS GOING TO GIVE RELIEF EMILY AND WHAT'S AMAZING IS YOU TALK ABOUT MONEY COMING FROM CONSTRUCTIVIST ACTION WE HAVE ALMOST SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OF SURPLUS RIGHT NOW THAT'S SURPLUS IS YOUR TAXES THAT MONEY DOES BELONG TO YOU SO IF WE CAN'T TAKE FOR BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD COVER ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO GIVE TO THE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY. AND WHAT GOOD IS YOUR BILL GOING TO DO. I JUST FIND IT AMAZING THAT NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THE VOICES OF CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BILL IN THANK YOU MISTER KILEY A COMMON SENSE BILL THAT WOULD HELP EVERYONE AND YES WE HAVE WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW WITH UTILITIES WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. WITH FOOD AND WE HAVE SURPLUS YOU THAT CAN ADDRESS THAT BUT RIGHT NOW PEOPLE NEED TO SEAT AT THE PUMP AND IF YOU CAN'T DRIVE TO WORK YOU CAN'T WORK AND THEN YOU CAN'T PAY FOR THE TWO LEADERS TO CAMPAIGN FOR THE GAS. WE'RE HERE. WILLING TO THROW. A LIFE PRESERVER TO SOMEONE DROWNING AND YOU'RE LOOKING LIKE YOU WANT TO TEACH HIM HOW TO SWIM. THANK YOU. YES. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I AM. I AM BEYOND SHOCKED. OFFENDED AND APPALLED. THIS IS THE SAME SHENANIGANS THAT THE CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT THEY DON'T TRUST US THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS YOU DO I MEAN. MY DISTRICT. THERE ARE PEOPLE MEET YOU'RE LOOKING AT A GALLON OF GAS IS MORE THAN A GALLON OF MILK TODAY. PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. PUTTING A GALLON OF MILK FOR THEIR CHILDREN ON THE TABLE. OR TAKE THEM TO SCHOOL OR GET TO WORK. AND INSTEAD IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLICY DEBATE LET'S DEBATE WHY THIS IS A BAD IDEA TO SUSPEND THE GAS TAX WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF CASTING I HAVE NO VOTE JUST VOTE. WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS NOW. JUST VOTE NO IF YOU DON'T WANT IT. TELL THEM TELL THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE GAS TAX WHY DO WE HAVE TO KEEP ON THIS DEBATE HI JACKING A BILL THAT IS TO HELP RELIEVE IMMEDIATELY. CALIFORNIA FAMILIES THE HARD WORK IN CALIFORNIA THE MIDDLE CLASS AND LOW INCOME CLASS. TO GET TO WORK TO GET TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE TO TAKE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. WHY DO WE HAVE TO HIJACK THIS BILL. YOU'RE LITERALLY TAKING A BILL THIS IS SUSPENDED GAS TAX AND NOW YOU CAN ADD MORE TAXES TO WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CALIFORNIANS. THERE'S SO MANY THERE'S THOUSANDS OF OTHER BILLS. IN THIS BUILDING THAT YOU CAN HIGH JACK WHITE TODAY AND YOU'RE GIVING US AN AMENDMENT WITHIN SECONDS AND WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR IT. THIS IS WHY. THEY HATE CALIFORNIA THEY HATE OUR STATE GOVERNMENT LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO DE DE DE LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO DMV. BUT TODAY WE HAD TO VOTE TO EXTEND THE INVITATION. BECAUSE THERE'S TO OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND APPLICANTS THAT HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN ABLE TO GET THROUGH. TO GET RELIEF WHAT ELSE IS LEFT FOR CALIFORNIANS NOW. NOTHING. HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO SIT HERE EACH OF US REPRESENTING OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE. AND IT'S OKAY. THEY NEED THE GAS TAX RELIEF NOW. GAS STATIONS ALL OVER MY DISTRICT THE CHEAPEST ONE. COSTCO AND SAM'S CLUB ARCO. THEIR LINES ARE LIKE TWO HOURS. IT'S INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY DRIVING FAR AWAY AND WAITED FOR HOURS JUST TO GET A DOLLAR TO RELIEVE WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT TODAY. WHY ARE WE JUST BEING SILENT AND PROLONGING THIS LET THE BILL GO THROUGH. LET IT HAPPEN FEEL FREE YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO REPRESENT YOUR CONSTITUENTS VOTE NO. WE DID THIS ON THE FLOOR. WE'VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES AND ALL IT IS POLL LONGER THIS AND MOVING IT HI JACK AND DO ALL SORTS OF. FUNNY BUSINESS. IT'S TIME TO JUST TAKE A STAND WHAT YOU'RE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. THE MOM AND POPS LIKE ME. PRESS THE DRIVE THEIR CHILDREN I DROP MY TWO BOYS TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING BEFORE I GOT TO THE AIRPORT. OVER THE WEEKEND. I TO DRIVE INTO BASEBALL PRACTICE. TWO DIGITS TO. TWO SWIMMING. AB THIS THIS IS INCREDIBLE YOU'RE NOT HELPING. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF BILLS AND MISTER LEE YOU'RE WELCOME TO TAKE MY BILLS. I MEAN COME ON LET'S STOP BEING A CHILD ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THIS. I'M ASKING YOU TODAY. LET THE BILL GO FORWARD FEEL FREE TO VOTE NOW THAT'S ALL WE DO ASK YOU FOR TAKE A STAND EITHER WAY HI JACKIE GASES PENSION RELIEF BILL TO PUT IT MORE TAXES. ON CALIFORNIA IS THE WRONG THING TO DO. ANYONE ELSE. ALL MAKE A COMMENT BEFORE WE GO TO THE AUTHOR TO CLOSE. I AM I GUESS A LITTLE APPALLED AND SHOCKED THAT YOU ALL ARE SO APPALLED AND SHOCKED BY THIS. THIS IS EXACTLY OUR PROCESS THAT WE DEBATE A PROBLEM AND WHAT THE SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE WE DIDN'T INVENT ANY OF THIS PROCEDURE THIS IS LONGSTANDING PROCEDURE ABOUT WHAT WE DO IN COMMITTEE. I DON'T PROBLEM IS BEEN IDENTIFIED RIGHTLY BY THE AUTHOR WHICH IS THAT GAS PRICES ARE HIGH AND IT'S HURTING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD IT. NO ONE HERE DISAGREES WITH THAT. THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE ARE TRYING TO POINT OUT AND RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT WHILE THE PRICE OF OIL IS CONTINUING TO DROP THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL IS CONTINUING TO DROP IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PRICES IN CALIFORNIA KEEP GOING UP AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE SMALL INCREASE AT THE GAS TAX TOOK LAST YEAR WHICH WAS JUST A COUPLE OF PENNIES. BUT BECAUSE THE OIL INDUSTRY IS ADDING GIANT SURCHARGES WHICH THEY HAVE NOT EXPLAINED TO THE PUBLIC. IN ANY DEPTH EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE BEEN REPEATEDLY ASKED WHAT THOSE SURCHARGES ARE FOR. THEIR CHARGED IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT IN OTHER STATES. I KNOW THAT THE SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE WHO SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL BILL WOULD LIKE US TO ENGAGE IN THE SAME KIND OF TRICKLE DOWN. POLITICS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST YOUR BRAKES TO THE CORPORATIONS LET THAN LARGE CORPORATIONS CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT. DON'T TAX THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE MADE WINDFALL PROFITS THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR PROFITS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY DON'T TAXES THAT INSTEAD OUT DO ALLOW THEM TO CHARGE WHATEVER THEY WANT AND HOPE IT TRICKLES DOWN TO THE COMMON PEOPLE YES THERE'S BEEN A PROBLEM IDENTIFIED IN THIS BILL BUT NOTHING IN THE ORIGINAL BILL AS PROPOSED SAYS THAT EVEN A PENNY. OF THAT TAX RELIEF GETS PASSED THROUGH THE PUMP TO INDIVIDUALS WE LEAVE IT UP TO THOSE BIG CORPORATION TO THE SIDE BUT NOW THAT THEY KNOW THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY SIX DOLLARS A GALLON OR FIVE FIFTY A GALLON THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THAT SAYS BUT THEY DON'T JUST POCKET. THAT EXTRA MONEY NOTHING SO BECAUSE THIS PROBLEM IS SO GRAVE ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HAS PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION GO TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM THOSE WINDFALL PROFITS AND AT LEAST SAY IF YOU'RE GOING TO PRICE GOUGE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PIECE OF THAT AND GIVE IT RIGHT BACK TO THE PEOPLE NOW THE GENERAL FUND BACK FILLING. OF THESE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING THAT MR KILEY HAS NOT TOLD THE PUBLIC HERE IS THAT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING CALLED BEGAN LIMIT IF THAT MONEY GOES INTO THESE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AND IS TAKEN OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO BE GIVEN BACK TO THE PUBLIC. WON'T GO BACK TO THEM. SO ONCE AGAIN THAT MONEY COMES OUT OF THE POCKETS. OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE TO PROTECT. TO PROTECT. THE WINDFALL PROFITS OF THE OIL INDUSTRY SO IT'S PROPER THAT WHEN A PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED. THAT WE DON'T THINK. A SOLUTIONS BEING OFFERED TO THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO MAKE A SUBSTITUTE MOTION THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DONE HERE TODAY. BUT TO PRETEND THAT THERE'S THAT WE'VE ANYTHING WE OFTEN IN COMMITTEE SUGGEST OTHER SOLUTIONS OF COURSE WE COULD JUST VOTE THIS DOWN. WE KNOW WE COULD JUST VOTED DOWN BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP HERE AND TRY TO GIVE PEOPLE RELIEF AT THE PUMP BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. SO I DO THINK THAT. UGH UGH I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME ISSUES HERE BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL CAUSES EXTRA PROBLEMS WHICH IS TAKING AWAY MONEY THAT RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO TAXPAYERS SUPPORTED. WE KNOW THAT THIS THIS GAS TAX WAS JUST VALIDATED AGAIN BY THE PUBLIC TWO YEARS AGO. AT THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. TO KEEP ROADS SAFE TO KEEP BRIDGES FROM COLLAPSING TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY WANT. BUT THAT MONEY WILL BE PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THEM. AND SO THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT COULD BE CREATED BY THIS. SO I CAN I WILL BE SUPPORTING MR LEE'S AMENDMENT AND WITH THAT I'LL GO TO MISTER KILEY FOR HIS CLOTHES ON MY BECAUSE THIS IS A BRIEF POINT OF CLARIFICATION IF YOU THINK THIS ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL IS THAT IS A GOOD IDEA TO SOLUTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT YOUR NAME ON IT IS THE AUTHOR. YOU ARE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL MR KILEY. I'M OFFERING YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AUTHORED THIS BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY. BUT NO I HAVE NOT. HAD A CHANCE TO DIVE IN DEPTH INTO THIS. WHAT DO NOT VOTE ON IF YOU MOVE THIS BILL INTO THE NEXT COMMITTEE I'LL BE HAPPY TO PUT MY NAME ON IT MISTER KYLE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT YOUR NAME ON IT RIGHT NOW. MISTER SMITH THIS IS NOT HARD ORDER YEAH. MADAM CHAIR OF YOU HAVE GIVEN THE SPEAKER THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE AND I THINK IT'S HE HAS A RIGHT- AS A PERSON BRING THIS BILL BEFORE THE CLOSE AND NOT DEBATE THE CHAIR WHETHER NOT SHE SHOULD PUT HER NAME ON THE BILL I THINK IT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE I THINK THIS THE SPEAKERS ARE CLOSE PORES CLOSE REMARKS SO WE CAN GET ON WITH PEOPLE'S BUSINESS THANK YOU. YEAH YOUR YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN MISTER KILEY YOU'RE CLOSING YOUR NOT CROSS EXAMINING THIS IS NOT A COURT YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE LAWYER CROSS EXAMINING HERE YOU CAN CLOSE AND WE CAN MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND THEN IT WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR BILL I SEE OKAY SO HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE WE DO HAVE TO PROPOSALS. I'M WILLING TO PUT MY NAME ON MY PROPOSAL FONG IS GOING TO PUT HIS NAME ON IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN IS ONE OF HER NAME ON IT. SOME WOMAN DAVIES WENT ABOUT HER NAME ON IT YET. THIS IS YOUR PROPOSAL IS SO ODIOUS. BUT YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO ATTACH YOUR NAME ON. THIS POLLUTED FOR YOUR NAME ON IT. ESTERLY WHICH I. MADAM CHAIR ORDER IS DO NOT PLEASE DIRECT MR KILEY YOU'RE MAKING A STATEMENT YOU CAN ASK WHATEVER QUESTIONS YOU WANT BUT I'M GONNA ASK OUR COMMITTEE TO NOT RESPOND TO YOU. MAKE YOUR STATEMENTS. SO I THINK THAT ABOUT SAYS IT ALL. WE ARE GOING TO OWN OUR PROPOSAL YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO PUT YOUR NAME ON YOURS SO LET'S JUST TAKE A STEP BACK FOR A SECOND. HERE WONDER WHY CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE OF ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY. YOU WONDER WHY. WE'VE NOW REACHED A BREAKING POINT WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR HISTORY. ARE LEAVING THE STATE THAT ARE COMING HERE. EVER WONDER WHY THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS SAY THE KIDS GROWING UP IN OUR STATE TODAY WILL BE WORSE OFF THAN THEIR PARENTS THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND OUR PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S DEBT. THIS USED TO BE THE STATE WHERE ANYONE COULD GET AHEAD IT'S NOW THE STATE THAT SO MANY CAN'T WAIT TO LEAVE BEHIND. AND THAT IS A TRAGEDY. AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DENYING THAT IT IS THE RESULT OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES. AND THE PROCEEDINGS HERE TODAY ARE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT. THE ARGUMENTS RAISED AGAINST THIS BILL ARE SELF EVIDENTLY BOGUS. IF GAS PRICES IN CALIFORNIA ARE ENTIRELY A PRODUCT OF INTERNATIONAL EVENTS. AND WHY DOES CALIFORNIA HAVE MUCH HIGHER GAS PRICES IN ALL FORTY NINE OTHER STATES. SEVENTY CENTS HIGHER THAN THE NEXT CLOSEST STATE. IF SPENDING THE GAS TAX IS SOMEHOW. POLITICALLY MOTIVATED THEN WHY DID EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT MEMBER OF THE CONNECTICUT LEGISLATURE VOTE TO DO PRECISELY THAT. WHY DID THE VERY LIBERAL GOVERNOR OF CONNECTICUT NO TO DO PRECISELY THAT. WHY DID THE SAN DIEGO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A RESOLUTION. URGING THIS BODY URGING THE GOVERNOR TO DO EXACTLY WHAT MY ORIGINAL BILL. WOULD DO HERE TODAY. IF THIS BENEFITS WOULD NOT BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS THEN WHY DID OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST THE NONPARTISAN OFFICIAL APPOINTED UNANIMOUSLY BY THIS BODY WHY DID OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS SAY THAT IT WOULD OR WHY HAVE GAS PRICES DECLINED IN THE STATES THAT HAVE SUSPENDED THEIR GAS TAX FOR WHY IT IS EVEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSING TO HOLD OFF ON ANOTHER THREE CENT INCREASE TO THE GAS TAX THIS YEAR IS IT BECAUSE GOVERNOR NEWSOM WANTS TO GIVE GAS COMPANIES OIL COMPANIES. A THREE CENT WINDFALL. IF THIS BILL IS SOMEHOW GOING TO TAKE FUNDING AWAY FROM ROADS THEN WHY DOES THE PLAIN TEXT OF THE OF THE OF THE BILL SAY THAT IT WILL NOT. SO WE HAVE TO PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF US. WE HAVE ONE THAT WOULD CUT OUR STATE'S GAS TAX WE HAVE ANOTHER THAT WOULD RAISE TAXES. I PREFER MY VERSION. NOW I AM NOT GOING TO CRITICIZE ALEX LEE GUY SINCE THE MOMENT HE GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TODAY IT IS A NOTHER EXAMPLE THAT MAKING HIM DO THIS MAKING HIM DO YOUR BIDDING. WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE HE WON'T EVEN PUT HIS NAME ON THE BILL I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM WE CAN ALL REMEMBER A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE. BERATING HIM FROM THE DIESS. SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND SO THIS SPEAKS TO MORE THAN AN ISSUE. OF DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN. REPORTER I REALIZE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WANT TO TURN EVERYTHING INTO A CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL FIRST USUALLY FAIL CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN BUT- ASKING TO STICK TO THE MERITS OF THE CONVERSATION IN THE MERITS OF THE BILL AND NOT GET SIDETRACKED BY UNNECESSARY PERSONAL ATTACKS ON MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN MISTER KILEY CAN YOU. STOP WITH THE PERSONAL COMMENTS AND TRY TO STICK TO THE MERITS OF YOUR OF THIS BILL ENDING A PERSONAL COME HAS JUST TRANSPIRED. IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. I MISTER KILEY YOU'VE EXCEEDED THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE GET PEOPLE TO CLOSE SO IF YOU CAN TRY TO. CLARA AND THANK YOU. IF IT IS YOUR BASIC DECENCY. AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES WE CAN HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES OF POLICY. BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS BILL I MEAN. IT WAS SITTING ON THE DESK GATHERING DUST FOR OVER TWO MONTHS I INTRODUCED IT. ON JANUARY TWELFTH THAT'S THE REASON WE TRY TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE. BECAUSE WE WERE GIVEN HERE. SO THEN AFTER WE DO THAT YOU FINALLY DECIDE TO GIVE IT A HEARING AND OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS. YOU'RE NOT PARTICULARLY CLEVER ABOUT IT. I YOU BROUGHT THE PARLIAMENTARIAN WITH YOU BY THE WAY IS A IS A WONDERFUL PERSON AND DOES HER JOB. VERY WELL. I'M AND SO I KNEW WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I EVEN TRIED TO TALK TO THE CHAIRMAN FOR HIM TO SEE IF SHE WOULD. SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT NOW. I THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF THAT SO I THINK THAT. THE ISSUE HERE IS REALLY ONE OF BASIC DECENCY AND THE ISSUE A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IS ONE THAT I WOULD HOPE WOULD JUST BE KIND OF A SLAM DUNK LIKE PEOPLE ARE REALLY IN PAIN. PEOPLE NEED RELIEF IT'S HURTING THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS THE MOST I'VE TRIED TO PROVIDE A FORM OF RELIEF THAT WILL BE IMMEDIATE. IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE IT'LL HELP OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT IS BEING. USED AS A VEHICLE TO JUST BUY POLITICAL GAMES BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS. BASED UPON THAT PASSION THAT WE HEARD FROM SOMEONE NUMBER FONG- JANET NGUYEN. LAURIE DAVIES FOR MANY OTHERS IN THIS LEGISLATURE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE DETERRED BY THESE POLITICAL GAMES WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE TURN THE STATE AROUND. SO I URGE A NO VOTE ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT- MY COLLEAGUES I'M WILLING TO PUT HIS NAME ON AND I URGE A YES VOTE ON THE ORIGINAL BILL BUT I AM PROUD TO HAVE MY NAME ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT TO PASS AS AN AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN HI FRIEDMAN IPHONE. FONG NO BERMAN BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM NO DALY. DAVIES DAVIES NO GIPSON GIPSON I KALRA OVER I LI LI I BLEW. HELLO I. NAZARIAN WHEN NO O'DONNELL. WARD WARD I WICKS WICKS I. HE. EIGHT FOUR EIGHT FOUR THAT BILL IS OUT. WE WILL MOVE ON. TO MS BURNER FOR ABOUT THE BILL. OF SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN. YES WELL NOW WE HAVE GREAT THINGS TO MOVE TO BIKES- MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AB SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN WOULD MAKE INTERSECTIONS SAFER FOR BICYCLISTS DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS BY ALLOWING BICYCLISTS TO TREAT STOP SIGNS AS YIELD SIGNS WHEN APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION SPECIFICALLY THE BOAT WILL OUT INDIVIDUALS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER. TO YIELD WHEN APPROACHING A STOP SIGN AN INTERSECTION A RECENT AS RECENTLY AMENDED THE BILL DOES THE FOLLOWING AND MAKES A SIX YEAR PILOT PROJECT INSTEAD OF THREE YEAR SIEGE B. DOES NOT ENOUGH TIME TO ANALYZE THE DATA WE HAD AND THAT'S CONVERSATIONS. LIMITS THE STOP AS YOUR TO TWO LANE ROADS WITH STOP SIGNS AT ALL CORNERS THIS IS TO MERA MORE SPECIFICALLY THE DELAWARE YIELD WHICH THIS BILLS BASED ON THAT RESULT RESULT IN A 23% REDUCTION IN BY CAR COLLISIONS- AND ADDS THAT MINORS WHO FAILED TO STOP AT STOP SIGNS WILL GET A WARNING TICKET FOR THE FIRST OFFENSE. VEHICLE CODE TWENTY ONE EIGHT OH FOUR ALREADY PROVIDES A CLEAR LEGAL DEFINITION AN EXPECTATION OF THOSE REQUIRED TO YIELD AT INTERSECTION. UNDER THIS CODE SECTION THE DRIVER OF ANY VEHICLE INCLUDING BIKES APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WITH A YIELD SIGN MUST YIELD TO THE RIGHT OF WAY OF ANY VEHICLES OR PEDESTRIANS AND ENTERED THE INTERSECTION AB SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN YEARS OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF A YIELD SIGN TO ALLOW BICYCLISTS APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WITH A STOP SIGN TO SLOW DOWN AND YIELD TO ANY CARS AND PEDESTRIANS. ALREADY IN THE INTERSECTION. IF IT IS ONLY IF AND ONLY IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO A BICYCLE CAN THEN PROCEED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WITHOUT MAKING A COMPLETE STOP I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT SEVEN AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY IS NOT A BILL AUTHORIZED BY SCHOOLS TO DO A ROLLING STOP. BLOW THROUGH A STOP SIGN A ROLLING STOP AND BLOWING THROUGH A STOP SIGN IS THE LEGAL NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ILLEGAL UNDER MY BELT ROLLING STOP IS NOT YIELDING. THE GOAL OF AB SEVENTY THREE THIRTEEN IS TO MAKE BICYCLES BEHAVIOR PREDICTABLE FOR DRIVERS AS THEY APPROACH AN INTERSECTION ALL ROADS LEAD TO BE SAFER FOR ALL ROAD USERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN WITH US I THINK ON THE LINE I HAVE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL JIM BURROWS PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF BICYCLE ORGANIZATIONS. THANK YOU A TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS JIM ROSS AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BICYCLING ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING THIS COMMENT TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN THIS CHANGE THE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF SERVE TO HELP MAKE BICYCLING IN CALIFORNIA SAFER.

I'M SORRY CAN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON PLEASE. THERE WE GO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON I'M KATHY BRINK AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH. OF THIS IS A BILL THAT WE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO OPPOSE LAST YEAR AS WELL. OUR OUR JOB FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS HAS BEEN TO WORK ON REDUCING UNINTENTIONAL CHILDHOOD INJURIES. AND EVEN THOUGH- AND WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL THE PROBLEM WITH CHILDREN AS THEY MIMIC. THEIR SIBLINGS THEY MIMIC THEIR PARENTS THEY MIMIC OTHER BICYCLE RIDERS AND WE ARE. REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT TEACHING THEM THAT IT'S OKAY TO ROLL THROUGH A STOP SIGN. OF THE GOVERNOR MADE A POINT OF LAST YEAR WHEN HE VETOED THE ORIGINAL BILL. THAT SAYS. OF FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INJURIES HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE ON THE STATE'S ROADS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. THE STATEWIDE INTEGRATED TRAFFIC RECORD SYSTEM SHOWS THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. THERE WERE THREE THOUSAND FIFTY NINE CRASHES INVOLVING BICYCLES AND INTERSECTIONS IN WHICH THE PRIMARY COLLISION FACTOR. WAS FAILURE TO STOP AT THE STOP SIGN. A WE BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT STOP MEANS STOP. AND THAT THE CONFUSION THAT THIS WILL CAUSE FOR DRIVERS WOULD LEAD TO ADDITIONAL FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INJURIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND ON THE PHONE WE HAVE ERIN READ FROM A REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMEN OPERATE IF YOU CAN FIND MISTER REED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ERIN READ EVERYTHING C. H. P. WE WANT TO IDENTIFY WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY KATHY BRINK AND- WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH HER POSITION- YEARS EXPECTING CHP OFFICERS.

EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN SIXTEEN THEY'RE WEARING A HELMET SOMETIMES YOU'RE WEARING MASKS IF IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL IN IN THE ONUS IS ON. THE OFFICER DID YOU MAKE THAT DETERMINATION- IT IS IT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING THEM IN A- DIFFICULT POSITION- TO TRY AND DO THAT- IT'S ALSO. YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS. DON'T STOP. PEOPLE ON TELEVISION FROM. HE READ. OF THREE TO- CRASHES IT IS SERIOUS AND THAT'S HAPPENING NOW- IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE AT IT THIS IS A PILOT. IT INSTEAD OF JUST ONE LEGAL BY THE NUMBER OF YEARS WE SHOULD BE LIMITED AND LOCATION. IT IS A STATEWIDE EVERY THAT THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES OF ROADWAY THERE COVERED BY THIS BILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ROADS THAT ARE TWO LANE ROAD- BOTH INCORPORATED CITIES AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF OUR STATE THIS BILL SHOULD BE LIMITED.

MISA MISA BURNER HARBATH AP SHEET THE THAT YOU BRING THIS BILL FORWARD I'M ALWAYS JUST VERY HESITANT ABOUT BILLS THAT TRIED TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE ONE SIZE FIT ALL. AND I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS BEFORE TODAY- I WAS HOPE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THE IDEA OF AT LEAST MAKING IT BASED ON JURISDICTIONS BECAUSE- NOT ALL COUNTIES ARE THE SAME NOT ALL. JEWISH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE THE SAME. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WOULD WORK NECESSARILY WELL. IN LOS ANGELES. AND I APPRECIATE THE FOLKS THAT ARE CALLING IN. AS WELL FROM LA BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND INTERSECTIONS. I DON'T KNOW IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD WORK WELL IN A PLACE IN A DENSE AT PLACE LIKE LOS ANGELES. UP BUT I KNOW THAT IN. SPACE WISE 90% OF THE REST OF THE STATE IT'LL WORK JUST FINE. I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT MAYBE WE CAN. TAILOR IT SO THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN PARTICIPATE IN THIS SAID THAT THOSE THAT DON'T FEEL IT'S APPROPRIATE. DON'T HAVE TO. SEVEN I RESPOND. TO YOUR RESPOND IN YOUR CLOTHES SO ME TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS YEAH MISTER- MISTER O'DONNELL. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR NOT. I WISH I COULD SUPPORT THIS TODAY BUT I'M JUST NOT THERE THIS IS A PARENT AND A TEACHER BROWN KIDS A LOT AND I THINK WHEN SOMETHING IS CONFUSING AT LEAST TO AN UNSAFE SITUATION HAS BEEN HAS BEEN HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO BY ONE OF THE- SPEAKERS EARLIER. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A SITUATION HERE WHERE. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA STOP SOMETIMES YOU DON'T STOP WITH THIS GROUP HAS A STOP THAT GROUP DOESN'T HAVE TO STOP TYPE THING AND I JUST THINK THAT'S GONNA LEAD TO CONFUSION CONFUSION LEADS FOR DANGER SO FOR THAT REASON FOR THOSE REASONS I CANNOT BE SUPPORTER OF. TODAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I'LL JUST MAKE MY COMMENT BEFORE YOU CLOSE WHICH IS I SUPPORTED THE PREVIOUS BILL AND I WAS SORRY TO SEE IT BE TOWED YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THAT READ THAT 96% OF CYCLISTS ALREADY USE THESE ROLLING STOPS AND THAT SHOWS YOU THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WAY THAT WE'VE ENGINEERED OUR STREETS FOR CYCLISTS BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST DIFFICULT TO CONSTANTLY COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WHEN YOU'RE ON A BICYCLE AND PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN. BUT IN SOME CASES DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT IT YOU HAVE THAT YOU'RE BECAUSE YOU'RE SO MUCH SLOWER WHEN YOU'RE MOVING INTO THE INTERSECTION AND I THINK THAT LEGALIZING THIS NOT ONLY STOPS OF. THE THESEVERY PUNITIVE TICKETS THAT ARE GIVEN SOMETIMES FOR THIS- AND IT WOULD ALLOW- THE POLICE TO FOCUS ON THE TRULY DANGEROUS. BEHAVIOR FROM CYCLISTS. BUT ALSO GIVES CARS MORE CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD EXPECT IN TERMS OF CYCLIST BEHAVIOR- SO. I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR STATE YOUR STICK IT TO WITNESS- AND BRINGING THIS BACK TO US. EVEN THOUGH IT'S IN A DIFFERENT FORM WITH THAT I INVITE YOU TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS I'LL TRY TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS- THE REALITY IS- FROM WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID. WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING NOTHING TO MAKE CYCLING AND INTERSECTIONS SAFER FOR CYCLISTS. OF THE DELAWARE YIELD SPECIFICALLY USES YIELDING NOT ROLLING THROUGH AND APPLYING THROUGH STOP SIGNS. AS A VERY SAFE TECHNIQUE THEY DID A PILOT. STATEWIDE AND DELAWARE IS A SMALL STATE BUT WASHINGTON ALSO HAS OF A SEATTLE WHICH IS A VERY URBAN AREA. AND THE OVERSIGHT COLLISIONS AT THOSE INTERSECTIONS. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER NECESSARY AND WE LIMITED THE BELT TO ONLY TWO LANE ROADS WHERE THEY'RE AT- STOP SIGNS AT ALL- CORNERS. SO THIS WHEN APPLIED AT BLIND INTERSECTIONS OR TO A STOP STORY OF A THOROUGHFARE THIS WOULD WOULDN'T LIMIT IT TO WHAT DELAWARE DINES AT THE DELAWARE YOU KNOW THAT WE- MARK PROXIMITY THAT. THE REASON YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REGIONALIZATION RESENT REGIONALIZATION SO SAY WE WANT TO JUST DO A PILOT SAN DIEGO COUNTY RIGHT YOU'RE LIKE TASHA FROM SAN DIEGO. THEY ALL LIKE BIKING OF SAN DIEGO MAYBE THEY SHOULD DO THAT WE CONSIDER THIS OPTION THE PROBLEM ISN'T COMING FROM LA. DOESN'T EXPECT A BICYCLIST TO YIELD IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND THEY COME DOWN. YOU'RE NOT INCREASING THE SAFETY OF THE BICYCLIST. YOU HAVE TO DO IT STATEWIDE SO THE OF PREDICTABILITY. WE HAVE RULES THAT TO CLEARLY DIFFERENTIATE AT EIGHTEEN. EIGHTEEN AND BELOW HAVE TO WEAR A HELMET. WE CLEARLY HAVE RULES AND CYCLING AROUND WHAT MINERS ARE REQUIRED TO DO AND WHAT ADULTS ARE ALLOWED TO DO. AND THIS WAS SAY THIS PILOT WILL BE AROUND ADULTS AND THEREFORE YOU GIVE THE PREDICTABILITY. TO DRIVERS A WHAT THE BICYCLIST BEHAVIOR S. AND THAT IS THE KEY THAT RESOLVE THIS 23% REDUCTION AND BIKE CAR COLLISIONS. IN DELAWARE AND I THINK IF WE DO THIS AND WE DO THE SIX ARE PROBABLY WE'RE GONNA SEE THE SAME DATA. IN FACT THE NATIONAL PHONE TO GET THE APPRECIATION OF THE NATIONAL TRAFFIC. HEALTH AND SAFETY. REPORT IS LISTED IN YOUR- BILL ANALYSIS HAS THE SCENE THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. IN THE EIGHT STATES THAT HAVE. THIS LAW. THEY HAVE NOT SEEN AN INCREASE AND BY CAR COLLISION IF ANYTHING THEY'VE SEEN A- IT'S NOT THAT. THING BECAUSE WE'RE LACKING DATA ONE THING OUR BILL WILL DO IS ALSO GIVE A VERY REAL BUS THE- DATA. TO OUR- CYCLING COMMUNITY AND OUR- TRAFFIC COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN SAY THIS ACTUALLY REDUCES IT I WILL NOT RUN THIS BILL. IF I THOUGHT IT PUT ANYBODY'S LIFE IN DANGER. I DO THIS AS A CYCLIST I YIELD THROUGH STOP SIGNS I DON'T ROLL THROUGH STOP SINCE A YOU'LL TO STOP SENSE. BECAUSE MY PRIMARY GOAL IS A CYCLIST IS NOT TODAY. AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BUT TODAY. THANK YOU WITH A QUICK CANAVERAL CALL PLEASE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTEEN TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN I FRIEDMAN IPHONE. FONG NO BERMAN BERMAN I CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I DAILY DAILY I DAVIES DAVIES NO GIPSON. KALRA KALRA I LI LI I BLEW BLOOM I NAZARIAN. NAZARIAN NOT VOTING WHEN. NO WIN NO O'DONNELL- DONALD NOT VOTING. WARD WICKS. SEVEN TWO. THANK YOU THAT PULLS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU OKAY WE NOW HAVE MISTER GRAYSON WITH TWENTY THREE FIFTY. WELCOMING YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY WHICH WILL CREATE A CONSUMER REBATE PROGRAM FOR CONVERTING CARS INTO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AS CALIFORNIA DRIVERS SHIFT TOWARDS A CLEANER FUTURE CONSUMERS AND THE CAR INDUSTRY HAVE BEGUN CONVERTING USED GASOLINE POWERED VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN OR ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. MAJOR AUTOMAKERS INCLUDING FORD AND GENERAL MOTORS HAVE UNVEILED ZERO EMISSION QUOTE UNQUOTE CRATE MOTORS THEY CAN BE USED TO REPLACETHE ENGINE IN A GAS POWERED VEHICLE ONE MANUFACTURER OFFERS COMPLETE RETROFIT KITS FOR A CLASSIC VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE FOR JUST UNDER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CHEAPER THAN SOME OF THE MOST INEXPENSIVE ELECTRIC CARS ON THE MARKET. TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMERS DEMAND FOR MORE AFFORDABLE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS THE STATE NEEDS NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS TO MAKE SEVEN OWNERSHIP MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MORE AFFORDABLE BY CREATING A CONSUMER REBATE PROGRAM FOR CONVERTING USED GASOLINE POWERED CARS INTO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY WILL HELP THE STATE MEET THIS THAT MEET ITS AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS. MY WITNESS IS CHRISTIAN ROBINSON WITH THE SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT MARKET ASSOCIATION. OKAY YOUR- WITNESS IS BY PHONE SO IF WE CAN OPERATOR PLEASE FIND CHRISTIAN WROTE ROBINSON. FOR TWO MINUTES YES. FRIEDMAN LIKE YOUR FONG AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY WHAT TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE CONSUMERS TO CONVERT GASOLINE OR DIESEL POWERED VEHICLES INTO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OR TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR REBATE WHILE ENSURING THE 25% OF THOSE REBATES GO TO INDIVIDUAL SELLABLE ELIGIBLE FOR CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. MY NAME I KRISTEN ROBINSON I'M THE DIRECTOR STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT THE SPECIALTY EQUIPMENT MARKET ASSOCIATION WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN DIAMOND BAR CALIFORNIA. THEME OF THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED MOSTLY SMALL BUSINESSES NATIONWIDE INCLUDING OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED THE GOLDEN STATE THAT MANUFACTURE MARKET AND SELL SPECIALTY AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET PRODUCTS INCLUDING APPEARANCE PERFORMANCE RESTORATION AND TECH PRODUCTS FOR CARS AND TRUCKS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON MENTIONED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR IMPROVING AIR QUALITY IN REMOVING POLLUTING VEHICLES FROM THE ROAD. INCLUDING AIMING TO HAVE ALL NEW CAR SALES PZ EVEY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WAS CONSTITUTED STATE. ADDITIONALLY THE STATE HAS INTERMEDIATE GOAL IN INTERMEDIATE CALL HAVING FIVE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED BY TWENTY THIRTY. AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT NUMBER STOOD AT APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. UNFORTUNATELY IN THE CURRENT MARKET PLACE HE DAVIS ARE OUT OF REACH FOR MOST CONSUMERS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT FROM BLOOMBERG COUPLE ONLY 15% OF DRIVERS CAN AFFORD A NEW STAFF. AN INDIVIDUAL SPENDS VEHICLE A GROSS ANNUAL PAY OF A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER HOUSEHOLD IS NEEDED TO AVOID OF FORTIS APPS TODAY THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN CALIFORNIA SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND. WHILE IT CONSISTS CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS TOGETHER TWO THINGS ARE CLEAR CONSUMERS NEED MORE OPTIONS WHEN CONSIDERING IT'S A FUTURE I NEED SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AB TWENTY THIRTY FIVE TACKLES BALLS. BUT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEME SHOW LOS VEGAS WHICH WAS THE LARGEST AUTOMOTIVE TRADE SHOW IN NORTH AMERICA SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN. SAID CONVERSION STOLE THE SHOW. INCLUDING VEHICLES POWERED BY CHEVY'S EACH CRATE AND FORD'S ILLUMINATOR ELECTRIC CRATE MOTORS CHEVY THECREED INCLUDES AN ELECTRIC MOTOR BATTERY SYSTEM AND TRANSMISSION THAT CAN BE INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE. WELL FOR THE NOMINATOR COSTS JUST UNDER FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND I SHOULD MENTION THE BIRD THE INITIAL PRODUCTION RUN IN THE FOURTH GRADE- PENSION SOLD OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. CONVERTING OLDER CARS AND CLASSIC VEHICLES AND IS AS USING MOTORISTS LIKE THE ONES DESCRIBED JUST DESCRIBE. WHAT CONSUMERS TO PROVIDE PRESERVE CALIFORNIA'S RICH CAR CULTURE WHILE LIMITING CARBON EMISSIONS. HOWEVER THERE IS NO STATE SUPPORTED PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE CAN RUNNING GASOLINE OR DIESEL POWERED VEHICLES TRYING TO HYDROGEN OR ELECTRICITY. TO MEET THE CONSUMER'S DEMANDS AND CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE WAYS TO CREATE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION THE STATE NEEDS NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED. TO MAKE THAT OWNERSHIP MORE ACCESSIBLE. MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE HELP ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. BLUES WRITTEN TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

FINDING WIDE VARIATION IN CROSSWALK COVERAGE NEIGHBORHOOD TO NEIGHBORHOOD- SOME NEIGHBORHOODS HAD AS WELL WITH TO SOME WEALTHIER- WHITER NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE IT WAS COMPLETE 1100% SO AGAIN THAT WAS RELATED TO RACE AND CLASS AND WE SEE THAT KIND OF- PATTERN SORT OF ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IT'S DEFINITELY PREVALENT IN CALIFORNIA- SO WE WOULD REALLY URGE- WE URGE YOU TO CONTINUE LEADING THE WAY FORWARD ON THIS KIND OF- LEGISLATION AND- IF I CAN BE A RESOURCE TO ANYONE ON THE COMMITTEE- FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT.

WHEN I WAS STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THERE ARE NO CARS NEARBY I WAS CROSSING THE STREET RIGHT NEAR A WELL KNOWN PARK FOR HOMESTREET QUICK. I KNEW IT WAS CHANGE. I WAS CITED ANYWAYS IN THE POLICE OFFICER BLOCK TRAFFIC WHILE CITING A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHED I WAS MADE TO FEEL LIKE A CRIMINAL. IT IS THE ANSWER DIDN'T STOP ME FOR JAIL ON. STOP ME BECAUSE I LOOKED OF PLACE. I AM SOME BAGS WITH ME IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT I WAS HOME. THAT MADE ME A TARGET IN HIS EYES. WHILE CALIFORNIANS JAY WALKING EVERY DAY AND NEVER GET CITED LOWER INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR FRIEDMAN TARGETED FOR JAYWALKING. IN RELATED CITATIONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUTCHLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN ALAS WE ARE WE OPPOSED AB TWELVE THIRTY EIGHT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE REMOVED PREDICTABILITY AND CLARITY WHEN IT COMES TO TRAFFIC SAFETY RULES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR PEDESTRIAN AND MOTORIST SAFETY. ARE WE ARE CONCERNED AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR PRACTICAL EFFECT- BY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING WHEN A PEACE OFFICER MAY STOP AT PEDESTRIAN FOR A VIOLATION OF ONE OF THE AFFECTED SAFETY LAWS. LIMITING ENFORCEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO AVOID TRAFFIC COLLISIONS AND IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF ALL WHO USE OUR ROADWAYS WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THE EXISTING PROBLEM FURTHER ONLY PERMITTING ENFORCEMENT WHEN A REASONABLY CAREFUL PERSON WOULD REALIZE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE DANGER IGNORES THE REALITY THAT OFTENTIMES PEDESTRIANS AND MOTORISTS FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER AND ARE ONLY PROTECTED BUT HEARINGS TO CLEAR LAWS UNDER A PRESUMPTION THAT VIOLATIONS WILL BE SANCTIONED. FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WAS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY FOR OR AGAINST. THE B. TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN.

THANK YOU WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL TO SAY THAT- I UNDERSTAND THAT. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE WHO WALKS THERE ARE PLENTY OF TIMES WHEN BECAUSE OUR ROADS ARE OFTEN NOT DESIGNED OR ENGINEERED FOR PEDESTRIANS IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT. TO COMPLY WITH SOME OF THE TRAFFIC RULES THERE BEEN TIMES WHERE I'VE HAD TO WALK SOMETIMES AND IF EVER IF I WAS NOT GOING TO J. WALK. AFTER WALK A HALF A MILE OUT OF MY WAY BECAUSE THERE'S NO CROSS A LEGAL CROSSWALKS FOR INSTANCE IN AN AREA. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I WALK AROUND THIS CITY WERE I FEEL UNSAFE STANDING ON A CORNER AT NIGHT WHERE I FEEL A LOT SAFER CROSSING WHEN I CAN SEE FOR MILES AT THERE'S NO CARS AROUND. BUT I'M A WOMAN WALKING BY MYSELF IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO AND I'D RATHER JUST KEEP MOVING SO THERE'S REALLY GOOD REASONS WHY SOMETIMES PEDESTRIANS ARE SAFER- BY USING THEIR COMMON SENSE- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STREETS ARE NOT DESIGNED FOR THEM SO WHEN WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE DESIGN ALL OF OUR STREETS FOR PEDESTRIANS AND HAVE CONVENIENT SAFE CROSSWALKS EVERYWHERE. AND LIGHTED AREAS AND YOU KNOW THEN I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY BUT RIGHT NOW WE REALLY PENALIZE ARE PEDESTRIANS- MANY MANY TIMES BY THE LACK OF GOOD ENGINEERING FOR THEM AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO USE THEIR COMMON SENSE SO I REALLY. SOMEONE WALKS A LOT I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I USE THAT AS MY CLOTHES AND- JUST RESPECT YES PROPER. THANK YOU CLEAR ROLL CALL PLEASE. AB TWO ONE FOUR SEVEN DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN. HI FRIEDMAN IPHONE. FONG NO BERMAN VOTING DALY AYE DAILY I DAVIES DAVIES NO GIPSON. KALRA KALRA I LI LI I BLEW BLOOM I DATE AND IS THERE IN. NAZARIAN I WENT. WHEN NO O'DONNELL WELL DONALD I WORK THAT BILL IS OUT THE COMMANDER THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT THE APPROVAL YOU MAY COME AND- BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH AIMS TO INCREASE TRAFFIC SAFETY TO OUR DRIVERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION HEAT BOOK- JUDGE BUT A JUDGE RELEASED A REPORT THIS YEAR THAT REMAIN I DON'T REMIND US OF A TRAGIC FACT. THAT WE ALL KNOW TOO WELL. YOUNG NO NO THIS DRIVERS SUFFER FROM THE WORST RATE OF FATAL CAR CRASHES COMPARED TO ANY OTHER GROUP. INTO OFTEN THEY HAVE PASSENGERS THAT DIAL LONG THEM ALONG THEIR SIDE. FELLOW DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS THAT ARE INJURED AND KILLED ON THE OTHER END OF THE CRASH SO AB TWENTY THREE ADA IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS TO REDUCE THE CATASTROPHIC CRASHES. INCREASING TRAINING AND REDUCING DISTRACTIONS. EVERY STATE IN THE NATION HOUSE SOME OF SOME FORM OF GRADUATED DRIVER'S LICENSE PROGRAM OR GDL. IT'S BEEN KNOWN THROUGH TO SUCCESSFUL REDUCE FATAL CRASHES FOR. A NOTE NO VOICE DRIVERS WHO ARE WHO ARE LEARNING TO GET BEHIND THE WHEEL FOR THE FIRST TIME. UNFORTUNATELY OUR YOUNG ADULTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THIS PROGRAM ONCE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN. THIS IS BECOME A LARGER PROBLEM DUE TO THE REPORT BUT THE DMV THAT MORE AND MORE TEENAGERS ARE WAITING UNTIL THEY TURN EIGHTEEN BEFORE THEY GET THEIR LICENSE. MAJORITY OF THOSE WHO ARE WAITING. BUT WHO ARE WAITING DO SO BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL REASONS RELATED TO THE COST OF DRIVING. WELL WE HELP PEOPLE DEAL. HE DELAYING GETTING THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSE. MORE REPORTS ARE COMING OUT THAT SHOWS THAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLDS FIRST TIME DRIVERS ARE IN A FATAL CRASH CAN COMPARE TO THE SIXTEEN THE SEVENTY YEAR OLD COUNTERPARTS. THIS IS A MAJOR DEMONSTRATION OF THE COST OF GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL WITHOUT RECEIVING THE BENEFITS OF IT OF THIS GDL PROGRAM. EXPANDING THE GDL PROGRAM TO EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY YEAR OLDS. FIRST TIME DRIVERS AS AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT DOES IT IS ESTIMATED TO SAVE HUNDREDS OF YOUNG LIVES EVERY YEAR. HUNDREDS OF LIVES EVERY YEAR AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. NEW JERSEY HAS ALREADY MADE THIS CHANGE TO THEIR PROGRAM AND HAVE SEEN AN INSTANT BENEFIT. THIS HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING UP OP OBJECTIVE OF THE STATE'S STRATEGIC HIGHWAY SAFETY PLAN. THAT IS SUPPORTED BY GROUPS RANGING FROM TRAUMA HOSPITAL. TRAFFIC SAFETY EXPERTS INSURANCE GROUPS FIRST RESPONDERS IN MANY OTHERS. THERE HAS BEEN NO RE REPORTED OPPOSITION OR NECESSARY EXEMPTIONS ARE IN THE PLACE OF THOSE WHO WERE WHO HAVE RECEIVED COMMERCIAL LICENSE AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO WERE DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK IN ORDER SCHOOL. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY. IS PAT AT PAINS AND PUT IT PRESIDENT THE SAFE PRESIDENT OF SAFE MOVES THE LARGEST TRAFFIC SAY PROGRAM FOR SCHOOL KIDS SHE IS ALSO PRESIDENT OF THE NOR ROSE HYNES FOUNDATION NAMED IN HONOR OF HER DAUGHTER WHO DIED IN EIGHTEEN DRIVER- CRASH COLLISION COLLISION. ALSO HERE IS EVETTE CHINESE REPRESENTED IMPACT TEEN DRIVERS A NATIONAL RENOWNED TEEN AND YOUTH DRIVING SAFETY PROGRAM WHO WILL ALSO SPEAK TO THE IMPACT OF LOSING HER SISTER IN EIGHTEEN INVOLVED CRASH. IN NINETEEN INVOLVED CRASH BESIDES ME IS STEVE BORROW STATE PROGRAM DIRECTOR OF THE CIA COALITION OF CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH AND A FORMER EMT PARAMEDIC WHO WILL BE ABLE TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS HERE. THANK YOU WILL GO TO YOUR WITNESSES FOR UP TO TWO MINUTES APIECE- THERE YOU GO THANK YOU I LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHORED FOR BEING SO SUPPORTIVE AND INSTRUMENTAL IN LEADERSHIP IN THIS LINE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS IN THE CHAIR FOR HEARING OUR STORIES. AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE THIS ISSUE IS ONLY TO MYSELF BUT PARENTS- THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS HE MENTIONED- NOR WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD- WHEN SHE WAS HIT BY ANOTHER NINETEEN YEAR OLD DRIVER OF THE NINETEEN YEAR OLD DRIVER WHO HIT NORA WAS TRAVELING IN THE CAR WITH FOUR OTHER TEENAGERS SHE WAS TRAVELING ON A ROAD- THAT WAS POORLY DESIGNED AND LOST CONTROL THE CAR AND T. BONE MY DAUGHTER. AND SHE WAS INSTANTLY KILLED UP NORA I JUST WANT TO SPEND A MINUTE A TALK ABOUT NORA NORA WAS ONE OF THOSE KIDS WHO I WAS A GREAT HUMANITARIAN SHE ON A DEVOTED TIME AT TWELVE YEARS OLD WORKING IN A ORPHANAGE IN GUATEMALA SHE- EDUCATED KIDS AT MY NONPROFIT WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING FOR FORTY YEARS- TEACHING OTHER YOUNG CHILDREN ABOUT THE DANGERS OF CROSSING THE STREET HOPING THAT THEY WOULD BECOME A BETTER TEAM DRIVERS AND I HAVE TO SAY AFTER NOR WAS KILLED AFTER FORTY YEARS OF DURING TRAFFIC SAFETY. I DID THOUGHT I WOULD TURN MY BACK ON TRAFFIC SAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CRUEL JOKE CLAMMY AFTER FORTY YEARS OF MY LIFE SAVING OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN THE LOSE MY BELOVED DAUGHTER HER BROTHER WILL IS HER TWIN AND HE'S NOW TAKEN UP THE MANTLE OF TEACHING- DRIVER SAFETY TWO TEAMS TO HIGH SCHOOLS OF THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION THAT NO WHAT NO PARENT CAN IMAGINE THIS HAPPENING TO THEM UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO YOU. AND I SPENT MY LIFE SAVING OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AND I SEE AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT IS A WAY THAT NORRIS DEATH CAN MEAN SOMETHING TO OTHER PARENTS I WOULDN'T WISH THIS ON ANYONE FROM AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG DRIVERS IN THE PAST YOU WOULD BE GETTING THEIR LICENSE- WHEN THEY'RE SIXTEEN ARE NOW WAITING AND THEY HAVE NO EDUCATION I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO. HIT I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY INVOLVE TURN THE FOUNDATION SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD NO DRIVER SAFETY EDUCATION SHE GOT HER LICENSE AT EIGHTEEN AND SHE STARTED DRIVING. SHE REGRETS NOT HAVING THAT EDUCATION SHOOT SOMETHING SHOW LIVE WITH WITH THE REST OF HER LIFE. BUT I THINK WITH THE PASSING OF AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT WE CAN REDUCING INJURIES AND DEATH AMONG FIRST TIME DRIVERS BY CLOSE TO FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. I OFTEN THINK THAT NORD BE ALIVE TODAY HAD THIS LAW. PASSED WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE. HELP ME ENSURE THAT NO OTHER PARENT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT MY FAMILY IS GOING THROUGH MANY LOST NOR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE UP WITH THE LAST FOR WORKING WITH US TODAY AND MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HEARING US AND OUR STORIES TODAY. MY NAME IS A BIT TRY THIS AND I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR TEEN SAFE DRIVING BECAUSE MY LITTLE SISTER IF SEE BECAME ONE OF THE- YOUNG PEOPLE WE LOSE ANNUALLY AND PREVENTABLE CAR CRASHES. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE WE COULD FILL EIGHT LARGE YELLOW SCHOOL BUSES WITH THE AMOUNT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WE LOSE ON CALIFORNIA ROADWAYS. IT'S IT WAS A FUN LOVING SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD-GIRL SHE WAS OUTGOING SHE LOVED LIFE SHE WAS THE KIND OF PERSON WHO HAD SUCH A LARGE PERSONALITY THAT SHE WAS FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE SHE MET- SHE WAS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT. WOULD COME AND TELL YOU A JOKE TO MAKE YOUR DAY BETTER WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A BAD DAY- IT'S C. WAS A TYPICAL TEENAGER REALLY MUCH LIKE THE TEAMS YOU HAVE IN YOUR LIFE- SHE HAD GOALS AND DREAMS SHE WANTED TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL EARLY SO SHE COULD GO INTO A MEDICAL ASSISTING PROGRAM AFTER WHICH SHE WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE SHE WANTED TO SAVE LIVES. JUST LIKE TEENAGERS SHE MADE POOR CHOICE OF. GOOD CHOICES AND POOR CHOICES. UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THOSE CHOICES COST HER LIFE. ON A LABOR DAY WEEKEND IT'S AND HER FRIENDS CHOSE TO GO TO THE BEACH AND ON THE WAY BACK. THEY WERE. HAVING A GOOD TIME THEY WERE SINGING AND DANCING THAT WAS PLAYING IN THE CAR. DISTRACTING THE DRIVER THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD. WHO WAS DRIVING. AND- THEY WERE JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME. WHILE THEIR FRIENDS BUT ALONG THE HIGHWAY. THE CHOICES MADE IN THAT CAR THAT NIGHT ALONG WITH THE DRIVERS IN EXPERIENCE LED TO A SINGLE VEHICLE ROLLOVER IF HE DIED AT THE SAME. AND THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. WE LOSE. NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND TEENS ANNUALLY TO SOMETHING THAT IS DRIVERS THROUGH THE AGE TWENTY YEARS OLD HAVE THE HIGHEST CRASH RATES INVOLVING SERIOUS INJURIES AND DEATHS OF OUT OF ANY AGE OF DRIVERS ON THE ROAD CALIFORNIA'S VDL PROGRAM WILL ENSURE YOUNG DRIVERS. HAVE THE DRIVER EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE THEY NEED TO DECREASE SPREADING RISKS AND RISKS TO EVERYONE ELSE SHARING THE ROAD WITH THEM. CURRENTLY ONLY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS- MUST GO THROUGH ART ST STUDIO PROGRAM EVEN THOUGH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEAR OLD NOVICE DRIVERS HAVE CRASHED RATES OVER DRIVERS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH G. B. L. PERHAPS IF THE EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD DRIVER IN THE CRASH THAT KILLED IF HE WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE GDL AND WASN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE PASSENGERS IN HER CAR MY SISTER WOULD STILL BE HERE. IT IS TOO LATE FOR ITS IN OUR FAMILY. BUT YOU CAN STILL SAVE COUNTLESS LIVES BY SUPPORTING AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT. AND WHO KNOWS MAYBE THE LIFE THAT YOU COULD BE SAVING IS SOMEBODY THAT YOU LOVE AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU FOR COMING IN PERSON AND SHARING YOUR VERY POWERFUL STORIES WITH US VERY VERY IMPACTFUL. I'M WE DON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION ON FILE SO I'M GONNA GO TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER O'DONNELL THE AUTHOR BIG HEART THAT PRESHEAF THE STORIES VERY MUCH AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH TRAGEDY WITH CARS IN MY OWN FAMILY I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH TRAGEDY WITH VEHICLES. THE CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH THIS APPROACH TODAY IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IS IT SOMEWHAT UNFAIRLY TARGETS LOW INCOME FOLKS. IN MY FAMILY WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET MY DAUGHTER THROUGH DRIVER TRAINING WHEN SHE WAS SIXTEEN AND GET OUR LICENSE. AND SO. RISE TWICE WHERE I SEE THE UNFAIR IMPACTS ARE ON THOSE FAMILY THOSE PEOPLE. WHO DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO GET THIS TYPE OF TRAINING AT AN EARLY AGE I MEAN WE CAN SEND PEOPLE OFF THE WATER WE CAN'T LET THEM DRIVE A CAR. I'M A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGE WITH THAT TODAY. AN OFFICIAL WANTED TO RESPOND TO THAT OR NOT WHY DON'T WE WHY DON'T WE WAIT TILL THE CLOSING WILL WAIT UNTIL HIS CLIENT LET HIM RESPOND THANK YOU. MR WARD. IF THANK YOU FOR I BRING THIS BILL FORWARD- THERE'S JUST A GUT CHECK THAT JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT FOR ME- KNOWING THAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE YEAR OLDS WHO HAVE MATURED BEYOND FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN- ARE NOW ENTERING THE WORK FORCE HAVE I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME EXEMPTIONS BUILT IN HERE- BUT STILL HAVE TO GO FOR SOME OF THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AS WELL- AND I'M WONDERING ARE THERE ANY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THIS LIMIT AS WELL- FOR PDL UP TO TWENTY ONE. IT WILL WILL HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE QUOTE OF THE QUESTION I HAVE- BECAUSE IT'S JUST IT IT DID FEELS LIKE SOMETHING IS JUST A BIT A BIT ASKEW HERE AND I'M- I'M I'M WAITING ON THIS RIGHT NOW I FULLY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND- AND YES I THINK. YOU KNOW YOUNGER DRIVERS IN GENERAL- CAN- POSE- MAYBE MORE IRRESPONSIBLE- A DECISION MAKING IN THE SUMMERS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THAT DECISION MAKING. NECESSARILY GET BETTER- WITH THE MY REQUIREMENTS OF GOING THROUGH- YOU KNOW THE COURSE WORK AND A PERIOD OF HAVING A PROVISIONAL DRIVER'S LICENSE. I'M UNCLEAR. WHAT PLANTS ARE LIKE YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY I'M FINE WITH YOU ASKING YOUR- YOUR ADVISORS OR ANY OF YOUR SPONSORS FOR ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF YOU WANT DURING YOUR CLOSING FOR THESE QUESTIONS SO THE SPEECH RIGHT HERE SIR. YEAH MY NAME IS STEVE BARROW I'M THE STATE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR CHILDREN'S SAFETY AND HEALTH. I WAS IN THE M. T. TWO PARAMEDIC AND JUST FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I SAID ON OUR STATE CMS COMMISSION ASKED- NEW JERSEY HAS ENTERED IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A STATE THAT HAS. MOVED ITS YEAH IT'S GDL PROGRAM COMPONENTS UP. THROUGH AGE TWENTY AND THEY'VE HAD A REMARKABLE- READ REDUCTION JUST LIKE THE RESEARCH SHOWS. IN THE NUMBER OF FATAL CRASHES AS WAS STATED. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS WITHOUT GDL HAVE 4260% HIGHER. FATAL CRASH RATES THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN OUR STATE THAT TRANSLATES INTO AN EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED- YOUTH IN THE GROUND IN THE BOX. AND SO IT IT DOES DOES MAKE QUITE A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE. ON THE OTHER ISSUE THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSES IS THAT. WHEN I WAS YOUNG. WE USED TO GET OUR LICENSE WHEN WE WERE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS OLD SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. 45% OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT GET THEIR LICENSE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY. AND SO THERE THEY DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF ANY OF THE TRAINING THE BILL DOES. TAKEN TO A APPRECIATION THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH YOUNG ADULTS THEY'RE NO LONGER TEENAGERS ARE MOVING INTO ADULTHOOD. SO THE BURDEN OF PROVISIONAL LICENSE PERIOD THE DRIVER EDUCATION PERIOD EVERYTHING IS CONDENSED THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED- TO SPEAK TO. OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL'S ISSUE IS THAT- IS OUR LOW INCOME THERE IS A PROVISION IN THIS BILL THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN JUDY ALL RIGHT NOW AND THAT SAYS IF YOU'RE FROM A LOW INCOME. FAMILY THIS IS A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR EFFORT TO GET THROUGH GDL ALL LICENSE DRIVER EDUCATION SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THIS BILL WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW YOU TO PAY OVER TWELVE MONTHS NO FEES NO INTEREST RATES. SO YOU CAN SPREAD THAT OUT AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LICENSE DRIVERS NOT THE BIGGEST COST. THE BIGGEST COST TO YOU IS GOING TO BE OWNING A CAR PAY FOR GAS PARKING INSURANCE. MAINTAINING THAT PARK THIS IS A MICRO COSM OF PRICE TO PAY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK OF. THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEAR OLDS HAVE 4260% HIGHER FATAL CRASH RATES WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE JUDY ALL PROGRAM. SO I'M AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER OTHER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM THANK YOU I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD I MEAN AS A FATHER OF FOUR THREE MY DAUGHTERS ARE. BUT I AND I LIKE THANK YOU GUYS FOR- THE TESTIMONY NINE. TODAY AT. I WOULD NEVER WANT TO BE IN THEIR SHOES. BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE I'M WHEN I'M WITH MY TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD BY A NINETEEN YEAR OLD. WELCOME STILL INSTRUCTOR I'VE ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP TRYING TO TEACH OF. BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY KNOW AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAR THEY HATE WHEN FATHERS IN THERE BECAUSE I'M STILL TEACHING UP TRIED TAP. I'M TRYING TO HELP THEM. BUT. T. HERE THAT THE THAT WE CAN LOWER THE PERCENTAGE RATE HERE THAT WE CAN SAVE LIVES. TODAY AND TO MAKE THAT CHANGE OTHERS NOT JUST BECAUSE OTHER STATES ARE SEEING OR DOING IT. BUT WE CAN DO THAT. I MEAN I'VE I'VE BEEN THERE IN THAT CAR TOO MANY TIMES AND I HATE. IF I GET A CALL IT'S ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND I'M GOING OH MY GOD PLEASE. I HOPE IT'S NOTHING NOTHING BAD AT THE TRAGIC. IT'S USUALLY LIKE A I'M TRYING TO GET INSIDE THE DOOR WHATEVER IT IS RIGHT. SIDE LIKE I IN RELIEF. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE STORY AGAIN WE DON'T WANNA SEE WE WANT TO LOWER THAT NUMBER DOWN. AND BY DOING THIS I GIVEN THE TRAINING- WE WILL. SO WITH THAT- VENTURE ASTRONAUT THANKS SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN. OF SERIOUS INJURIES AND DEATHS IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN A ROW SHOWS THAT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. AND LIKE YOU SAID WE'VE SEEN THESE EFFORTS- HE DIVIDENDS AND OTHER STATES. I APPRECIATE BRING THIS BEFORE AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT OF TODAY. WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE- I'M SORRY DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION IN MANY MANY SECOND SO WE HAVE A ROLL CALL PLEASE AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY A DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN AYE FRIEDMA AYE FONG. FONG NOT BOOTING. BERMAN CUNNINGHAM CUNNINGHAM AYE DALY AYE DALY AYE DAVIES DAVIES I GIPSON. KALRA KALRA I LEE. LEARN. HELLO I THIS AREA. THIS AREA I WENT. WHEN NOT VOTING O'DONNELL O'DONNELL NOT VOTING. FORD WARD I WICKS. EIGHT ZERO IT'S YOUR THE BILL IS OUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN AND NOW I'M GOING TO BE PRESENTING MY BILLS BECAUSE WE SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST. AND MR FONG WILL BE CHAIRING. THANK YOU BETTER CHAIR. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO FILE ITEM ELEVEN. A TEN THEN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX. FILE A PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. WITH AB NINETEEN OH NINE STRUCTURE. ARE MOVING TO TWENTY AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX FILE ITEM ELEVEN. EACH YEAR. THANK YOU MEMBERS I'LL MOVE APPROVAL. THANKS WE HAVE A MOTION AND OPEN MY SAYING I'M I CAN AUTO DIAL HERE. IT'S A LONG DAY- IT'S WHICH STARTED IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CITY- SO. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I CARRIED TWENTY THREE SIXTY THREE ZERO TRAFFIC FATALITIES TASK FORCE WHICH ASK HOSTED TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO SLOW DRIVERS DOWN ONE OF THOSE BILLS PASSED LAST YEAR AB FORTY THREE WHICH I THINK MOST OF YOU IF NOT ALL OF YOU VOTED FOR. ABOUT GIVING CITIES FLEXIBILITY TO SET SPEED LIMITS AND THIS IS THE COMPANION PIECE TO THIS WHICH HAS TO DO WITH HOW TO ALLOW OUR CITIES TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE OUR SPEED LIMITS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS WITH A PILOT PROGRAM IN A SMALL NUMBER OF CITIES IT WOULD ALLOW FOR CAMERAS IN. IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS BEING IN HIGH INJURY NETWORKS OR WHERE THERE IS VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO ENFORCE SPEED LIMITS USING SPEED CAMERAS NOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE SAFEGUARDS EMBEDDED IN THIS BILL FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE TO BE GOING AT LEAST ELEVEN MILES AN HOUR OVER THE SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE MORE EGREGIOUS DRIVERS. THE MONEY THAT'S GENERATED IN FINES HAS TO GO RIGHT BACK INTO THAT VERY SAME COMMUNITY FOR PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE THOSE ROADS SAFER SO IT GENERATES REVENUE NOT FOR GENERAL FUND NOT NIPPED UNITIVE WAY BUT TO ACTUALLY DO IMPROVEMENTS ON THOSE DANGEROUS ROADS. THE TICKETS ARE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE OF WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE DEPLOYED OR WARNINGS TO PEOPLE AND THEN WHEN WE START TO GIVE THEM THEIR FIFTY DOLLAR TICKET THEY STARTED FIFTY DOLLARS COMPARE THAT TO A REGULAR SPEED LIMIT THAT'S REGULAR SPEED TICKET GIVEN BY AN OFFICER WHICH CAN BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. THE TICKET GOES TO THE CAR KIND OF LIKE A PARKING TICKET SO IT THERE'S NO POINT IN ANYONE'S LICENSE- BUT IT DOES NOTIFY PARENTS THAT THEIR CHILDREN MAY BE ARE EGREGIOUSLY SPEEDING OR RECKLESSLY DRIVING WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE KNOW SO WE HAVE TRIED TO BUILD EQUITY AND SAFEGUARDS AND GUARD RAILS INTO THIS PROGRAM I NEVER REALLY DONE THIS AND ALSO THE CITIES HAVE TO WARN PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE COMING INTO HIS OWN OR THE SPEED CAMERAS ARE BEING USED. BECAUSE OUR INTENTION IS TO TAKE THE MOST DANGEROUS STREETS IN A COMMUNITY AND SLOW PEOPLE DOWN IT'S NOT TO PUNITIVE REALLY MOVE AROUND THE CITY AND GET TICKETS OUT. IT'S TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE ON THE SAFETY OF THOSE ROADS AGAIN THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM TO COLLECT DATA ON IT. WE KNOW IN OTHER CITIES WHEN THIS HAS BEEN USED IN OTHER STATES THAT IT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS THAT ARE RECKLESSLY DRIVING AND SPEEDING. IT'S PERFECT TO USE IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE STREET RACING WE ALL KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GOOD AS THEY ARE CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GIVE COMMUNITIES THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS. THIS IS DONE IN A NON PUNITIVE WAY I THINK IT'S SENSIBLE WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE. WHO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM- BUT WE DO HAVE WITNESSES. YOU'RE IN TODAY- WITH US FIRST WE HAVE MAYOR SAM LOOK- LICCARDO FROM SAN JOSE. AND THEN DOCTOR REBECCA PLEVEN WHO'S A TRAUMA AND SURGICAL CARE- CARE DOCTOR AT ZUCKERBERG SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. THANK YOU JEFFREY AND WE WILL STAR IN THAT ORDER WILL GO TO YOU- AT. THE SATURDAY MAYOR AND THEN WILL PROCEED TO DR ELEVEN. OPERATOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME. YES. I'M SORRY BY HERE FONG ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME A YES PLEASE PROCEED. WELL GREAT THANK YOU FOR GIVING- BUT SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY ON BEHALF OF THE MORE THAN ONE MILLION SANDERS ANSWERED SERVICE MAYOR. I WANT TO THANK CHAIRPERSON FRIEDMAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX TO ALLOW CALIFORNIA CITIES TO PILOT AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT TO ENHANCE SAFETY ON OUR ROADS. IN MY CITY SAN JOSE AS IN CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE SEEN HORRIFIC INCREASE IN AUTO RELATED DEATHS. AND WE KNOW FROM OUR DATA 30% OF THOSE AUTO FATALITIES. SPEEDING POLICY KEY PARTS OF THAT COLLISION AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT CLEARLY WORKS A TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO STUDY FOR THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD CONFIRMED WHAT SEVERAL U. S. CITIES HAVE ALREADY FOUND WITH AUTOMATED SPEED ENFORCEMENT REDUCING TRAFFIC FATALITIES. BY BETWEEN FORTY SIX AND 71% CITIES LIKE PORTLAND NEW YORK WASHINGTON DC. CALIFORNIA LAW PROHIBITS CITIES FROM USING THIS TOOL TO MAKE OUR ROADS SAFER HOWEVER. YET 62% ASSEMBLY AND SURVEYED BY EMC RESEARCH LAST MONTH STATED DAY QUOTES SUPPORT THE USE OF SPEED CAMERAS. TO IMPROVE STATE STREET SAFETY. SUPPORTED EVEN HIGHER AMONG OUR LATINO MEDINA RESIDENTS BECAUSE HALF PERCENTAGE TRAFFIC DEATHS AND SERIOUS INJURIES OCCUR ON ONLY 3% OF OUR STREETS OVERWHELMINGLY LOCATED AMONG THE MOST DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOODS IN EAST AND CENTRAL SATURDAY. SO TO IN OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES WERE BLACK OAK WONDERS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE KILLED OR SEVERELY INJURED IN A TRAFFIC CRASH. AS OF THE RESIDENTS AND 60% OF TRAFFIC TAX AND SHIPPING CHOOSE GO OCCURRED IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH THE CITY'S LOWEST INCOMES. WE APPLAUD THE AUTHOR STAFFERS TO ADDRESS EQUITY CONCERNS IN AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX BY REDUCING FIND IMPLEMENTING DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR LOW INCOME VIOLATORS. AND PROTECTING PRIVACY TO STRICT LIMITS ON STORAGE AND USE OF THIS DATA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FOR THE CITY'S URBAN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORT OF TWO MEMBERS OF OUR LOCAL DELEGATION ASSEMBLYMEMBERS. KALRA KILEY THANK YOU. I THINK YOU MAY ONE GO TO DOCTOR LEVIN. PLEASE PROCEED. ELEVEN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE AND I'M DOCTOR REBEKAH PLAN AND THEN I MET TRAUMA SURGEON AND YOU POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND BAKER BURKE SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. AND I'M HERE TONIGHT IN MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OR TO BE A TOUCHY. EVERY YEAR OVER FOUR HUNDRED SAN FRANCISCANS ARE STRUCK BY A CAR WHILE WALKING. CYCLING OR RIDING A TRANSPORTATION DEVICE. AND THAT MEANS THAT EVERY DAY THE TRAUMA SURGERY TEAM AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL CARES FOR A PEDESTRIAN OR A CYCLIST WHO WAS HIT BY A CAR. FOR ME AND FOR MY TEAM THE IMPACT OF TRAFFIC VIOLENCE IS A REALITY THAT WE ENCOUNTER EVERY SINGLE DAY AT WORK. WE KNOW THAT HOW FAST OUR CARS TRAVELING MATTERS. SPEED AFFECT WHETHER THE VICTIM OF THE COLLISION LIVES OR DIES WHETHER THEIR INJURIES ARE DEVASTATING OR RELATIVELY LIFESTYLE. AND I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF EVERY TRAFFIC COLLISION BECAUSE EACH ONE IS A TRAGEDY BUT AS A TRAUMA SURGEON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY OR FORTY MILES PER HOUR CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. BROKEN BONES AND THE DEVASTATING BRAIN INJURY OR INTERNAL BLEEDING. FOR PATIENTS WHO DO SURVIVE THEIR INJURIES MANY FACE A LONG RECOVERY AND SOME NEVER RETURNED TO THEIR PREVIOUS LEVEL AND HOW. THIS REALITY IS CATASTROPHIC NOT JUST MY PATIENTS BUT ALSO TO THEIR FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES. AS MENTIONED WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRAFFIC INJURIES ARE AN ISSUE OF EQUITY SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE OF SEVERE AND FATAL TRAFFIC COLLISIONS OCCUR. THE CARD I JUST MENTIONED OVER HALF THE STREETS RUNNING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE INHABITED BY SENIORS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THE WLKING AND PUBLIC TRANSIT AS THEIR PRIMARY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. INCREASING DRIVER SPEED IN THESE COMMUNITIES OF CRITICAL TO PROTECTING SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS. I'M HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA SURGEON I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. I WANT ALL CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO SAFELY MOVE AROUND THEIR CITIES TEND TO ENJOY HE HELP AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS. OF WALKING AND CYCLING WITHOUT FEAR OF INJURY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW PROCEED OPPOSITION. WE HAVE THE ACLU- BAKER CREAM A MOTOR MOTOR APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- WILL GO TERRY THE ACO FIRSTAND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. CATALINA SANCHEZ. SO IF WE CAN FIND BECCA MAY PROCEED READY BACK IN MY MATTER ON BEHALF OF ACLU CALIFORNIA AND ACTUAL OPPOSITION. THERE ARE OTHER MEANS OF REDUCING DEBATE. ALEXANDER BUT DO NOT IMPLICATE PRIVACY IN EQUITY INCLUDING. THOSE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE BILL ITSELF. YOU KNOW TO BE PAID TOPICS ARE AND TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURE. YET MANAGEMENT CENTER THE THEY'RE CHRISTIAN THE BILL INSTEAD RELIES ON SURVEILLANCE THE AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT AND INCREASED TICKETING. DR AFTER GETTING PRIVACY I COULD BECAUSE I ONE BUT THERE'S ANOTHER. HARD OF PROVIDING MEANINGFUL ACTION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE TRAFFIC CALMING MEASURES I DID MENTION TO COST THE MONEY HOWEVER AB. TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX ALTHOUGH HAVE CAUGHT. GOOD EVENING YOU CAN PAYMENT HAVE ABOUT AB TWENTY THIRTY HAMPERS THE BURDEN HONORABLE HELD. FOR EXAMPLE THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN TICKETING THAT AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY THAT. WOULD GO AGAINST THE RECENT REFORMS THE CALIFORNIA PICKETING MARC TO REDUCE THE WELL DOCUMENTED ECONOMIC HARM CARBON AFTER GETTING A TICKET EARLY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WOMEN OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK IN MY NEXT WOMEN ARE ESPECIALLY LIKE YOU CAN STOP. AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY SIX WE HAVE MADE AND THE BATTLEGROUND OF THE CONFLICT I TEACH AND- I LOVE THE WEATHER NANKERVIS IDEATION. WHILE THE BILL INCLUDES SOME EQUITY PROVISION THEY'RE OUTWEIGHED BY THE DUE PROCESS PROBLEMS AND I THINK PROTECTION. FOR EXAMPLE DESPITE REQUIRING TICKET BE PAID OR ACTED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF MAILING A NOTICE OF VIOLATION. THE BILL HAS NOT REQUIRED BUT I THINK IT WAS VERY CLEAN AND LACKED ANY ALLOWANCE. FOR EXTENSIONS OF TIME. THERE ANY WHO MAY THE DEATH OR NOT HAVE A RESOURCE TO PAY THE FINE WILL NOT BE ABLE REGISTER VEHICLE. DRIVERS WHO NEED TO USE VEHICLE GET TO WORK PROPERLY OFFICE SCHOOL FOR OTHER LET ME. WILL CONTINUE DO SO REGARD OF MY TO. BECAUSE THEY TO YOU THEM. BUT THEN PULLED BACK DOWN MARKET AND AGAIN. DOWN LEGAL ACTION SPIRAL. ANOTHER HE SHALL YIELD CALLING FOR ACTUALLY IN THE NORTH OPPOSITION YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW TO THE CHRONIC FROM FOUNDER. THE PROCEED. SHE REMEMBERED CATALINA SANCHEZ CORBIN KINDER AM REFER A FRIENDSHIP A WITH INTERSECT BOB TO AND IF I MADE A QUICKLY ALSO ADD NEED TO ON BEHALF OF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE WELL WE APPRECIATE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH THE SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IN AB TWO THREE THREE SIX THE BILL DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT PRIVACY IN ORDER TO TRACK THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PERSONAL PRIVACY AND GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY SURVEILLANCE DATA LIKE THAT WHICH WOULD BE COLLECTED UNDER AB TWO THREE THREE SIX INCLUDE A LOT OF PERSONAL DATA THAT IS INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC ABOUT EACH INDIVIDUAL. YET AB TWO THREE THREE SIX LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE COMMUNITIES UP TO THE MERCY OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO DRAFT AND COMPLY WITH PRIVACY CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD PROTECT DATA FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND THIRD PARTY DATA SHARING RATHER THAN PROVIDING STRONG PRIVACY PROTECTION- CONDITIONALLY DOES BELIEVE IT UP TO THE CITY TO DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES THE CRITERIA UNDER WHICH THE PROGRAMS ARE BEING PICKED UP WELL THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT JUSTIFY CONTINUED USE OF DOWNTURN- BASED ON WHATEVER BENCHMARK THAT THE PARTS THEIR CONTINUED USE OF THE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH SURVEILLANCE CAN ALSO BE EASILY MISUSE CAN LEAD TO THE EROSION OF COMMUNITY TRUST AND COSTLY LAWSUITS AS WELL AS DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES AND I'M THINKING THERE'S AND LIBERTIES MORE AND MORE BECAUSE I NAY LPR INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED WITH OTHER DOES REQUIRED BY STATE LAW SHOULD EIGHTY TWO THREE THREE SIX AND AB TWENTY ONE NINETY TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M RAMOS. BOTH BECOME LAW AB TWO THREE THREE SIX COULD ALLOW FOR SETTING UP OF A SPEED TRAP OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL SURE IN THE LICENSE PLATE DATA WHAT I FOR EXAMPLE OR SETTING UP WITH THE TOP OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINIC OR GENDER FOR ME CLEAR CONNECT AND IT'S AGAIN SHARING THE L. CONFIRMATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER STATE THEY'RE CRIMINALIZING- COMING TO CALIFORNIA FOR THE SERVICE THAT. THEIR ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR REDUCING SPEED RELATED TRAFFIC COLLISIONS THAT DO NOT RAISE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS INHERENT INCREASING USE OF SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY BUT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PURSUE.

I STARTED THIS ORGANIZATION AFTER MY OWN TRAGIC COLLISION WHERE I WAS HIT WHILE RIDING A BICYCLE AND BECAUSE PARK. MAINTENANCE THE CAR AND DRIVE TO NEARLY A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE STREET ONTO AND ON THE FIVE FREEWAY. IN ONLY TWO MINUTES MY RIGHT LEG ABOUT TWENTY POUNDS OF FLESH WERE RIPPED OFF. THE DAY THAT I KNOW THE SUBJECT FROM THE GROUND UP IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE POINT TO DRESS IN AB NINETEEN OH NINE ARE COMMONSENSE AND SHOULD'VE BEEN ADDRESSED YEARS AGO. HOWEVER THERE IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS BILL THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND THAT IS SOMETHING I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT. AB NINETY NINE WOULD REQUIRE CARS TO MOVE OVER ONE LANE WHEN IT'S SAFE TO DO SO. A POPULAR PERSON ON A BICYCLE. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME LANGUAGE IT'S ALREADY IN THE LAW REGARDING PASSING STOPPED EMERGENCY VEHICLES IT ALSO COMMONSENSE. ONE OF THREE DIFFERENT ONES MAIN PROGRAMS IS CALLED STATE SUPPORT THAT HELP THOSE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED AFTER A TRAFFIC COLLISION TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET OR TWO SUPER THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO'VE LOST A LOVED ONE TO DO IT. DUE TO TRAFFIC VIOLENCE. I HAVE SO MANY HORRIFIC STORY THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED OR KILLED WHILE RIDING A BICYCLE. EITHER ENTRY TO RETALIATE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. IF DOES PROVIDE PROVISIONS IN AB NINETY NINE WERE ALREADY ADOPTED. MY BRING UP JUST A COUPLE OF THE STORIES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DIEGO MARTINEZ'S WRITING AND BICYCLING CENTRAL LOS ANGELES JUST A STONE'S THROW AWAY FROM FIVE MAJOR SCHOOLS WHEN HE WAS HIT AND DRAGGED UNDER A CAR SEVERAL CITY BLOCKS. HE SURVIVED BUT SUFFERED LIFE CHANGING INJURIES AND WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH HIM IN THE FAMILY TODAY. FIFTY TWO YEAR OLD MARKRAM WAS RIDING HIS BICYCLE WITH A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. IN CINEMA COUNTY MISTER GRAHAM WITH HIT AND KILLED A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY SURVIVED THE LOSSES LIKE. THIS IS ON THE TWELFTH OF MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIRTEEN YEAR OLD COPIER GONZALEZ WAS RIDING HIS BICYCLE ON THE FIRST OF MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE. HE DIED A FEW MINUTES AFTER HE WAS BEING HIT AFTER HE WAS SENT. AND IN THE CITY OF SILMAR NORTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY AN EIGHT YEAR OLD GIRL PROVIDING THEIR BICYCLES AND THEY'RE BOTH HIT AND SEVERELY INJURED. THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL NOW GO. TO OFFER GOING BACK YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD EVENING JERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR OFF THE GROUND THAT CAN IMPACT THE SAFETY SIGN IS THE LECTURE OF THE CO DIRECTOR OF THE UC BERKELEY THINK TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH AND EDUCATION CENTER AFFILIATED WITH THE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES. I'LL BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY ON HOW PARTS OF AB NINETEEN OH NINE ALIGN WITH THE STATE IT'S AN APPROACH TO ROAD SAFETY WHICH IS THE SAID THE PRINCIPLE THAT ELEMENTS THAT CAN GUIDE OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS BUILDING ITS SYSTEM ON WHICH NO ROAD USER CAN BE. SUBURBIA FATALLY INJURED. FIRST MOVING BALL OF THE CLASS THREE BIKES ON THE FACILITY DESCRIBE IN THE- WOULD IMPROVE ALIGNMENT THE PRINCIPLE OF THE STATE SET. IT PROVIDES BETTER MODE GROUPINGS IN CLASS YOU GUYS WILL BE GROUPED WITH MOLD THAT HAVE. SIMILAR MAGNITUDE OF KINETIC ENERGY. AND IN THE LONG RUN GIVE ME COURAGE MORE PRACTICE DESIGN CONSIDERATION. FOR VULNERABLE ROAD USER ENVIRONMENTS. SECOND REQUIRING MOTIVI OPERATORS WENT SAME DIRECTION TO MOVE OVER A LANE OF TRAFFIC WHEN POSSIBLE AGAIN IMPROVE ALIGNMENT WITH THIS EXTRA STROKES. IT WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REDUNDANCY OR LAYERS OF PROTECTION TO THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SEPARATION BETWEEN MODES. FURTHERMORE WHEN ROAD ROAD USERS DO MAKE A MISTAKE PROVIDE A WIDER SAFETY BUFFER AND WILL REDUCE THE CHANCES OF A CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME. BLACKLY ALLOWING BICYCLE TO FOLLOW LEADING PEDESTRIAN INTERVAL LPI. INTERSECTIONS WOULD EXTEND THAT BILLABLE PROTECTION THE BENEFITS BUT THAT'S GAINES WHO ALSO SERVES LIKE TO PUT. ALLOWING BICYCLISTS AN ADDITIONAL DEGREE OF PROTECTION FOR MOTOR VEHICLES OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE IN THE CALIFORNIA MODE MAKES BICYCLISTS ARE FOURTEEN POINT NINE TIMES MORE VULNERABLE RELATIVE TO OTHER MODES. AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. OF THE SYSTEM THANK YOU. A VERY MUCH WE DON'T HAVE ANY LISTED.

THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COMMITTEE STAFFER ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS- THIS BILL HELPS TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA MEETS A GHG REDUCTIONS EXPECTED UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY BY THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES BILL. THIS BUILDS OFF THE REPORT THAT WAS DONE BY- IN AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE REPORT THAT STATES A MID COURSE CORRECTION IS WARRANTED FOR IMPROVING THE CHANCES OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SUCCESS ONE OF THE MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS REPORT WHICH WAS COMPILED BY MANY MANY VERY SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD. WAS THAT IT A LIGHT WEIGHT WE ALIGN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE THE BILL WILL REQUIRE A RB AND CONSTRUCT CONSULTATION WITH OPR TO REVIEW EACH REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PART OF THE PROGRAM AND DETERMINE ITS CONSISTENCY WITH THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY. AND THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND EVERY TWO YEARS AFTER ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION FROM THE REPORT SAID THE FOCUS MPO PLANS ON FUNDING B. R. M. T. REDUCING PROJECTS AND I HOPE THAT THE- ACRONYMS FOR ALL OF YOU AT THIS LATE HOUR. THIS BILL REQUIRES A RB TO REALLOCATE MONIES FROM REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCY FROM FUNDING PROJECTS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR GOALS TO ONCE THAT ARE CONSISTENT AT YOU KNOW RATHER THAN CONTINUE GOING THROUGH THIS- I WOULD GO TO MY WITNESSES WHICH ARE BILL MCGAVIN FROM THE COALITION FROM CLEAN AIR. MERIEL OVERTURE FROM THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I. BOATS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE NGOS TO ADDRESS ANY OF THEIR LINGERING CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE RECEIVE OUR GOOD EVENING BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR AND I WILL BE BRIEF WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD REINVIGORATE CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES MORE SUSTAINABLE AND PROVIDE CLEAN MOBILITY. TO ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS IN THOSE EFFORTS HAVE NOT BEEN GOING WELL- AS THE AUTHOR SAID OUR TRANSPORTATION SPENDING IS OFTEN ACTUALLY ACROSS PURPOSES. WITH OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. AND IN IN FACT TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE BY FAR THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BIGGEST SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. POLLUTION FROM TRAFFIC KILLS MORE PEOPLE THAN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS DO. AND THAT SHOULD BE MOTIVATION ENOUGH TO CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING- BUT THERE'S ALSO THE FACT THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO FAIL TO ACHIEVE NATIONAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE AWAY ITS TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FROM THE STATE. SO THIS BILL WOULD SEEK TO RECTIFY THAT MISALIGNMENT AND- WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR. THANK YOU WILL NOW PROCEED TO KILLING A CESSATION. YES PLEASE PROCEED HERE YES THANK YOU- MY NAME MONEY OUT SO I AM THE CLEAN AIR ADVOCACY MANAGER FOR THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY BEING A COLLECTION FOR CLEAN AIR AND THAT OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND THE NEED TO ADDRESS AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GASES AND NIKOLAYEVICH TRAVELED- AT THE KEY PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY- WE URGE YOU TO MOVE AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY SEVEN FOR AND ENSURE CALIFORNIA MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARD HEALTHIER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FOR ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I BELIEVE WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS ON THE PHONE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WILL NOW MOVE TO THE OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE COVERAGE SO SESSION OF COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS HERE- OF. IS IT IS IT ON OKAY- GOOD EVENING I LEFT MY LONG NOTES BACK THERE ARE SO HOPEFULLY I'LL BE A LITTLE SHORT FOR THIS ON BILL HIGGINS AND THE EXACT ADDRESS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCIES AND ALL EIGHTEEN M. PO'S THE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ADOPTING A SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY. WE APPRECIATE THE- WORK AND EFFORT- THE- THAT TE AUTHORS DONE- UNFORTUNATELY THE AB TWO EIGHTY FIVE REPORT THAT SHE CITED AS THE BASIS FOR THIS BILL ON THIS ISSUE IS FLAWED AND INCONSISTENT WITH LAW IT SAYS THAT THERE ARE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS WHICH WE CALL TIPS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OUR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS WHICH A WHAT WE CALL OUR TEEPEES. BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OF. INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE DOING FIRST TO ROADS TO TRANSIT. IT'S NOT THE SAME AS IT IS WITH OUR AND OUR OUR TEEPEES. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT THE SAME DOLLARS. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN THE SCAD REGION. THE L. A. METROS OPERATION COSTS ARE IN YOUR RTP BUT THE HIP. SO OF COURSE THE TIP HASA BIGGER PERCENTAGE OF ROAD INVESTMENT IN IT. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE OPERATING COSTS OF TRANSIT THE TDA FUNDS ARE IN. THE RTP BUT THEY'RE NOT IN THE TIP SO WHEN THIS BILL SAYS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH. THE STATE THE STATE TO BE CONSISTENT THIS IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT FEDERAL LAW. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES OUR TIPS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR TEEPEES SO WE'RE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT A STATE LAW THAT DOES THE SAME THING AND THEN CONNECTS IT TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN ASTHE DEFINITION. CLIMATE GOALS THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN IS A WONDERFUL DOCUMENT BECAUSE IT TELLS US HOW WE GET TOWARD TWENTY FIFTY GOAL. BUT BECAUSE IT HAS TO GET TOWARD TWENTY FIFTY GOAL INCLUDE SOME ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE CANNOT INCLUDE IN OUR FISCALLY CONSTRAINED REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS. INCLUDING A PRICING INCREASE THAT IS EQUAL TO ABOUT TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A GALLON FOR GAS IN. IF YOU WERE GOOD BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET TO THAT GOAL IS TO PRICE SO PEOPLE DRIVE WHAT'S- WE CAN'T BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT BECAUSE THE WAY THE AIR CONFORMITY LAWS WORKERS MR MCGOVERN POINTED OUT. WE HAVE A WE COULD RISK LOSING OUR FOR FUNDING FOR NOT. CONSISTENT WITH OUR AIR CONFORMITY GOALS WHICH ARE PARTICULAR WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN GHGS. AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS HE DID VERY WELL WITHOUT NOTES- IT TO KEEP IT YOU TWO MINUTES BUT POLLS HAVE PLEASE WRAP UP PROJECT UP CLOSE IT'S THESE CONSISTENCY ISSUES THAT MAKES US SUPPOSE WE- AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE THANKS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW GO TO IN PERSON- SUPPORT OPPOSITION PLEASE PROCEED. OUR VICE CHAIR OF FONG AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M MARC WATTS REPRESENTING TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THAT CALIFORNIA'S TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT ALIGNED WITH OUR CLINICAL BUT THE STATE HAS ADOPTED AND CONSISTENTLY REAFFIRM- DESPITE- THE GOLDEN COMMITMENT. TO GROW COUNCIL FOUNDED THE REMAIN SIGNIFICANT MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN OUR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CLINICAL. THESE EFFORTS WILL ENSURE THAT AS WE INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING PROJECT THAT PUT US ON TE PATH ZERO MISSION ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

GOOD EVENING HI MARC WATTS WITH TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF. IT'S BEEN A GOOD HOUR WITH IS GOING THROUGH ALL THE LITTLE DETAILS IN THE BILL THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO US- SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE- ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. IS OF YOU KNOW TAKING THE MAJOR BIG TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND HAVING THE GUIDELINES. FOR THOSE MAJOR PROGRAMS. ALIGNED WITH THE CAPS I WHICH IS THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN. DEVELOPED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND AS WELL THE CTP THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN. IT MAKES SENSE FROM A PERSON FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE BUT IT'S A LITTLE LOOSE BECAUSE- FOR EXAMPLE THE CAPITA IS NOT- EMBEDDED IN A CODE OR A- ANY KIND OF A STRUCTURE THAT COULDN'T BE AMENDED SO LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT HOW THAT MIGHT WORK OUT THE FUTURE- AND I THINK I. THINK OF THE STOP AT THAT POINT BECAUSE WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION WE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO GET THIS BILL INTO GOOD SHAPE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT BIGGER. I THANK MR SO GUS CORN WE HAVE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY POLICY COUNCIL SENSE BECAUSE COALITION- SAME COMMENTS APPLY ON TWO TWO THREE SEVEN AT THE SAME WITH THIS BILL THE ONLY THING I WANT TO MENTION IS THAT I DO REPRESENT SEVERAL SMALL COUNTIES THIRTEEN OF THEM HAVE SELF HELP MEASURES WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WITHOUT THE PARTNERSHIP- IT'S MUCH HARDER TO. TAKE A BIKE OR TRANSIT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO THEN IT IS A LOS ANGELES OF THE NEEDS TO BE A SENSE OF PROPORTIONALITY WOULD BE EMPTY REDUCTION SO WHILE WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION THERE'S A LETTER THAT I UP LOADED THAT'S FIVE PAGES LONG WITH SOLUTIONS LOOK FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HOPEFULLY TO MAKE SOME.

MS DAVIS QUESTION FOR YOU I KNOW I KNOW TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB ONE WAS PASSED THAT WAS WITH A FUEL AND VEHICLE TAXES I THINK FIVE BILLION A YEAR THESE TAXES WERE PROMISED TO- MAKE SURE THEY WENT RIGHT TO THE ROADS TO FIX THE ROADS. WITH THIS PROJECT WOULD BE TAKING MONEY FROM THESE OF FROM SB ONE NO WHERE WOULD IT COME FROM KNOW THAT THIS IS OTHER POTS OF MONEY THAT'S USED FOR TRANSPORTATION ONE THING THIS WILL DO IS A LINE UP OUR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW IS WANTING US TO INVEST IN- NAMELY TRANSIT THIS WOULD HELP DIRECT FUNDS INTO.

BUT WHICH I TO CLOSE HERE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN HOW WE INVEST IN CALIFORNIA IN TRANSPORTATION. EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT CONGESTION AND THIS IS REALLY AN ATTEMPT TO START TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT OF OUR FOCUS IN THE STATE.
