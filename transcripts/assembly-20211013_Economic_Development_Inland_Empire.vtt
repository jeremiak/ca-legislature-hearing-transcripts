STATEWIDE- BUT THE NUMBERS ARE

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.354
REALLY SMALL- BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.322

MENTIONED SO WE CAN IT-

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:02.351

GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE SERVICE

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:52.869
SO THE PRIVATE DIVISION

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.103
OPPRESSION STANDARDS WHEN WE

WITH WORKFORCE INNOVATION

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.965
OPPORTUNITY DOLLARS THROUGH A

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:25.568

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.974
INLAND EMPIRE CYBERSECURITY

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:35.077
CONSORTIUM. IN CYBER SECURITY.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:37.446

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:38.848
LOW MULLIN TO HEALTH. I'M

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:40.216

TALENT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.432
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT THERE IS

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.834
A PREMIER INSTITUTION IN CSU

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:02.438
SAMBAR TO DINO- THAT HAS A

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.840
GLOBAL IMPACT. IN THEIR

01:04:04.907 --> 01:04:07.843
CYBERSECURITY PROGRAM. HOWEVER

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.546
ALTHOUGH 75% OF THEIR STUDENTS

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:11.214
WERE COMING FROM LOCAL

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.049
COMMUNITY COLLEGES INTO CSU

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:15.318
SAMBAR TO DINO. VERY FEW WERE

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:17.186
ABLE TO STAY AT HOME AND SO

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.788
ENDED UP IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:22.458
COUNTRY LIKE PALO ALTO- IN IN-

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:25.127
VIRGINIA- IN IN OTHER AREAS

WHERE THERE'S A CYBER SECURITY

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:28.464
NEED. AND SO THIS CONSORTIUM

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.866
WAS REALLY TO TRY TO KEEP- THE

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:34.303
BRAIN TALENT YET HOME. AND

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.539

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.683
BEEN SOME OF OUR CHALLENGES.

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.451
AND BEING ABLE TO CALL OUT

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:05.988
SPECIFIC ETHNICITY AND- GENDER

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:07.823
OF REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.859
A CHALLENGE FOR- THE STATE OF

WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS THIS

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:23.806
IS IMPORTANT NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:26.175
QUOTAS NOT NOT GETTING ABOUT

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.776
BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT WE

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:31.146
DO RIGHT AND IF YOU HAVE LESS

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.782
THAN TEN PERCENT. WHO ARE WOMEN

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:36.051
YOU ARE FAILING HIM BECAUSE YOU

01:12:36.118 --> 01:12:37.186

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.688
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. 50% OF THE

POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA IS

01:12:42.257 --> 01:12:44.159
WOMEN. AND IF WE LOOK AT IF WE

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:46.662
LOOK AT RACIAL DIFFERENCES THEN

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:48.764
WE'RE LOOKING AT 60% OF THE

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:51.800
POPULATION BEING LATINO. AND IF

01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:54.169
WOMEN AND LATINOS IN PARTICULAR

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:56.105
ARE NOT BEING INCLUDED WE ARE

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.474

UNUSUAL PROP TWO OH NINE THAT'S

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.111
NOT THE ISSUE AND IF YOU THINK

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.412
THAT IS THE ISSUE THEN YOU NEED

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.980
TO GET A LEGAL OPINION SO THAT

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.548
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN

01:13:06.615 --> 01:13:08.984
SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE. THOSE WHO

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.453
ARE BEING EXCLUDED BECAUSE IF

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.921

SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING THEM

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.660
THAT IS ILLEGAL ALSO. SO YOU

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.129
WANT TO TALK ABOUT PROP TWO

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:21.063
NINE AND BEING WITHIN THE

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.898
BOUNDS OF THAT FIGURE OUT TO

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.967
GET THE LEGAL OPINION SO THAT

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:26.902
YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.537
BECAUSE IN THE END WE HAVE A

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.372
GREAT SERVICE APPRENTICESHIPS.

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:32.674

AND HALF THE POPULATION IS

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.614
WOMEN YEAH AND WE'VE GOT TO

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.482
FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT

THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE BEING

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.186

THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED. IT

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.437

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.742
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE RESPECTED

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:36.644
THE SYSTEM OFFICE PERSPECTIVE.

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.779
INCLUDING FLEXIBILITY AND

01:33:38.846 --> 01:33:41.415
INCENTIVES AND HOW OR LEARN

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:43.451
HELPS PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION.

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:45.319
PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:47.321
OFTEN PREDATORY FOR PROFIT

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:50.124
INDUSTRY. AS A RELEASE THE

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:53.094
FLEXIBILITY- A KEY COMPONENT OF

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.929
SUCCESSFUL EARN AND LEARN MODEL

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:57.131
IS FLEXIBILITY AS WE LOOK TO

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:58.599
EXPAND THEM YOU KNOW TO NEW

01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.067
INDUSTRIES WE NEED TO BE

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.802
MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT IT'S

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:02.370
NOT JUST GOING TO BE A LARGE%

01:34:02.436 --> 01:34:04.638
BUSINESSES. RIGHT IT'S GOING TO

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:06.040
BE SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS

01:34:06.107 --> 01:34:07.208
WELL THAT YOU HAVE AN

01:34:07.274 --> 01:34:08.976
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. WE

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:11.812
ALSO NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.814
STANDARDS FOR APPRENTICESHIPS

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:16.217
AND- SITUATIONS WHERE THEY MAY

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:17.852
SET TOO HIGH OF A BAR FOR SOME

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:19.754
BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE WHICH

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.288
IN TURN MEANS THAT OUR COLLEGES

01:34:21.355 --> 01:34:23.190
CAN'T PARTICIPAT BECAUSE A

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:23.891
BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP IS

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.494
REQUIRED FOR COLLEGES. SO WE

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.362
RECOMMEND THAT THE CONSIDERING

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:30.598
THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE OTHER

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:31.632
MODELS OF EARN AND LEARN AS

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:33.768
WELL OUTSIDE OF THE FORMAL

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:35.336
APPRENTICESHIP PROCESS ALTHOUGH

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:37.104
DOES CONFIRM ANY BENEFITS AND I

01:34:37.171 --> 01:34:38.839
WANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN WE TALK

01:34:38.906 --> 01:34:40.608
ABOUT GREATER FLEXIBILITY.

01:34:40.674 --> 01:34:41.909
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:43.544
COMPROMISING PROGRAM QUALITY

01:34:43.611 --> 01:34:48.082
OR- LOWERING ANY OF OUR HIGH

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.849
STANDARDS FOR OUTCOMES.

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.918
COLLECTING QUALITY DATA AND

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:52.086
REPORTING ON OUTCOMES IS STILL

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:54.822
ESSENTIAL. AND THE COMMUNITY

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:55.423
COLLEGES ARE MORE COMMITTED TO

01:34:55.489 --> 01:34:57.291
THAT THAN EVER. THANKS TO

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.894
INCENTIVES THERE DO NEED TO BE

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:01.028
SUFFICIENT INCENTIVES BUILT

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:02.630
INTO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:04.932
WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE

01:35:04.999 --> 01:35:05.833
TYPES OF WORK BASED LEARNING ON

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.935
THE JOB- WORKFORCE TRAINING

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:09.103
PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW BENEFIT

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.504
BOTH STUDENTS AND BUSINESSES

01:35:10.571 --> 01:35:11.539
AND THEY NEED TO BE THE RIGHT

01:35:11.605 --> 01:35:13.607
TYPES OF INCENTIVES SO WE THINK

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.509
ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE PAYROLL TAX

01:35:15.576 --> 01:35:18.245
BREAKS AND CREDITS WHICH WE'VE

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:18.712
SEEN IN THE PAST AS A

01:35:18.779 --> 01:35:20.448
SUCCESSFUL MODEL. ANOTHER

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:22.216
EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE WHICH

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:24.051
REQUIRES A LITTLE BIT MORE SET

01:35:24.118 --> 01:35:25.586
UP FROM THE SORT OF GOVERNMENT

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:27.988
AND FUNNY PERSPECTIVE IS TO

01:35:28.055 --> 01:35:29.690
SUBSIDIZE WAGES OF STUDENTS

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.592
PARTICIPATING IN WORK BASED

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:32.159
LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WITH

01:35:32.226 --> 01:35:33.994
EMPLOYERS SO UNDER THIS

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.429
APPROACH THE WAGES THE

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:36.730
NECESSARILY HAVE TO FLOW TO THE

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:37.832
EMPLOYER BUT COULD BE IN THE

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:40.034
FORM OF FOR EXAMPLE A STIPEND

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:41.135
THAT A STUDENT RECEIVES UNDER A

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:42.703
WORK BASED LEARNING PROGRAM

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:43.938
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THIS

01:35:44.004 --> 01:35:47.074
WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE- PAYING

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.109
PEOPLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. RIGHT

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:50.544
AS AS JOY MENTIONED. THERE ARE

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:51.779
STUDENTS WHO SIMPLY CAN'T

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.647
AFFORD NOT TO WORK. BUT THEY

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:55.249
NEED THAT EDUCATION THEY NEED

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:57.118
THAT TRAINING SO WE CAN PROVIDE

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:58.786
THEM THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. TO

01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:00.488
COMPLETE THAT WATER GETTING

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:02.523
THAT TRAINING THEY'RE MUCH MORE

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:05.226
LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AS WE

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:06.427
LOOK TO NONTRADITIONAL

01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:07.661
INDUSTRIES AND EXPANDING

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:08.429
APPRENTICESHIP AND EARN AND

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:10.931
LEARN THEIR I KEEP PRIORITY OF

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.099
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.467
EXPANDINGBEYOND SOME OF THOSE

01:36:13.534 --> 01:36:15.302
TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES. AS WELL

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:16.904
AS MOVING BEYOND JUST HEALTH

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:18.339
CARE HEALTH CARE IS IMPORTANT

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:19.807
BUT IN THOSE MALLS ARE WELL

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:21.809
SUITED TO APPRENTICESHIP. FRONT

LOADED EDUCATION TRAINING WITH

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.346
HANDS ON PRACTICE AND SO FORTH.

01:36:25.412 --> 01:36:26.780
BUT WE DO NEED THE FLEXIBILITY

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:28.716
AS MAJORITY LEADER REYES NOTED

01:36:28.782 --> 01:36:30.651
TO EXPAND- NO LEARN INTO A NEW

01:36:30.718 --> 01:36:31.619

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.888

WAGE JOBS. THESE INDUSTRIES ARE

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.165
GROWING RAPIDLY ESPECIALLY IN

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.799
AREAS LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE

01:36:45.866 --> 01:36:48.969
AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:49.570
NEEDS THAT ARE NOT BEING MET.

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:50.371
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN HELP

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:53.040
FILL THIS GAP. I WANT TO ALSO

01:36:53.107 --> 01:36:55.442
NOTE THAT EARNING LEARN IN

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:56.844
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:58.913
COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN SERVE AS

01:36:58.979 --> 01:37:00.781
AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO FOR

PROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:05.186

PRESENCE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE

01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:08.889
BUT THEY OFTEN LEAVE LOW INCOME

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:09.590
STUDENTS WITH HIGH AMOUNTS OF

01:37:09.657 --> 01:37:11.458

ADDRESS MY REMARKS BUT- IT

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:38.445
OCCURRED TO ME AS THE MAJORITY

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:40.247
LEADER SPEAKING ON THIS THAT. I

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:42.516
VISITED ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:47.888

OUR WORKFORCE PROGRAMS RECENTLY

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.996
I WAS A CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM WE

01:38:56.063 --> 01:38:57.264
GOT TO MEET THE STUDENTS THEY

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:11.945
SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED TO

THINK THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT IT

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:22.690
I THINK OUR ELECTED OFFICIAL

ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:03.864
WE HAVE GOING THAT'S A BARRIER.

01:40:03.931 --> 01:40:06.233
WE'VE NEVER TOLD THE STORY. OF

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:08.635
WHY. WHAT'S IN IT FOR THEM AND

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.671
WHY IT'S NOT AS COMPLICATED AS

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:12.606
WE ALL THINK IT IS. YOU KNOW I

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:16.543
THINK I THINK. I'M LAUGHING

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:18.178

01:40:18.245 --> 01:40:20.514
FIRST LEARNED TO DRIVE GO BACK

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:22.149

DRIVE I HAD TO LEARN TO DRIVE A

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:25.819
STICK SHIFT AND IT SEEMS VERY

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:28.155
SCARY. AND THEN TO THINK ABOUT

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:29.390
RIGHT I LEARNED IN THE CENTRAL

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:31.425
VALLEY SO THIS IS MENTIONED

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:34.728
THAT IT WAS HOT. AND I REMEMBER

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:36.163
THE FIRST TIME GOING TO FREEWAY.

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:37.598
IT ALSO WHILE THAT FOR SOME OF

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:39.400
US BUT- THEN REMEMBER THE FIRST

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.668
TIME YOU DROVE IN A STORM AT

01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:51.805
HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON YOU KNOW

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.940
THEIR LIVES ESPECIALLY SINCE

01:46:54.007 --> 01:46:56.443
QUOTED. HOME SITUATION THIRD

01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:58.378
DEALING WITH FAMILY YOU KNOW

01:46:58.445 --> 01:46:59.346
THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING

01:46:59.412 --> 01:47:01.114
CARE OF YOUNGER CHILDREN

01:47:01.181 --> 01:47:02.783
PARENTS SIBLINGS WHOEVER.

01:47:02.849 --> 01:47:05.018
WORKING MULTIPLE JOBS SO I

01:47:05.085 --> 01:47:07.154
WOULD SAY AS A GENERAL

01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:07.721
PRINCIPLE ONE OF THE THINGS

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:10.257
WERE OBSERVING. IS THAT- IT'S

01:47:10.323 --> 01:47:12.859
BEST TO TAKE IT TO THE STUDENT

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:15.095
IF POSSIBLE. RIGHT SO THAT

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.296
COULD INCLUDE MODELS OF

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:18.899
OUTREACH WHERE- INSTRUCTORS AND

01:47:18.965 --> 01:47:19.966
SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS COME

01:47:20.033 --> 01:47:21.368
INTO THEIR FELLOW INSTRUCTORS

01:47:21.434 --> 01:47:23.103
CLASSROOMS WHICH I HOPE THEY

01:47:23.170 --> 01:47:24.771
WOULDN'T BE WAS COMPETITION BUT

01:47:24.838 --> 01:47:27.507
RATHER AS- RATHER IS A BENEFIT

01:47:27.574 --> 01:47:29.242
RIGHT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT

01:47:29.309 --> 01:47:31.511
THESE PROGRAMS- THAT

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:33.580
ORIENTATION COMMUNICATIONS

01:47:33.647 --> 01:47:34.114
COULD BE INCLUDED STUDENT

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:36.550
ORIENTATION- THAT COULD BE

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:37.951
INCLUDED WHEN STUDENTS GO INTO

01:47:38.018 --> 01:47:39.886
THAT. FINANCIAL AID OFFICE TO

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:41.555
BE ON CHOIR ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

01:47:41.621 --> 01:47:43.323
AID THE STATUS OF THE RAID. WE

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:44.357
CAN TRY TO ENSURE THEY GET

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:45.725
INFORMATION THROUGH THERE SO

01:47:45.792 --> 01:47:47.727
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS BUT

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.963
ON THAT. STUDENT UP ON THAT

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.964
TOUR I WAS REFERENCING

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:53.099
RECENTLY. STUDENTS TOLD US TIME

01:47:53.166 --> 01:47:55.135
AND TIME AGAIN. THAT IS MOST

01:47:55.202 --> 01:47:56.336
EFFECTIVE IF THEY HEAR THAT

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:58.405
INFORMATION FROM A LOT RELIABLE

01:47:58.471 --> 01:48:00.574
SOURCES AND AS MANY PLACES AS

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.442
MANY WAYS AS POSSIBLE SO I JUST

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:03.343
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MATTER

01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.412
OF. AFFECTED THEM REALLY

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:07.214
PERSISTENT OUTREACH TO A LARGE

OUTREACH- YOUR OUTREACH TO

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:12.786
THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE LEAST

01:48:12.853 --> 01:48:13.687
REPRESENTED IN SOME OF THESE

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:17.457
PROGRAMS AND INDUSTRIES IS

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:18.058
GOING TO BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:19.359
THAT AS WELL. THANK YOU AND IF

01:48:19.426 --> 01:48:20.961
I MAY BE GOING TO CHAIR- I

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:23.930
NOTICED THAT FOR TO RUN HEALTH-

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:25.632
UNDER YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS THIS IS

01:48:25.699 --> 01:48:26.466
WERE FOCUSING ON BEHAVIORAL

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:28.668
HEALTH. WHAT A WHAT A GREAT

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:31.271
IDEA WE WOULD THAT'S ALL WE

HEAR ABOUT IS MENTAL HEALTH.

01:48:33.139 --> 01:48:34.741
AND OF THE FACT THAT WE DON'T

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:35.542

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:37.510
PROFESSIONALS- WE DON'T HAVE

ENOUGH COUNTERS OR DON'T HAVE

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:41.715
ENOUGH THERAPIST- BUT TO FOCUS

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:44.517
ON THAT. THAT'S IT IT'S

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:46.186
BRILLIANT AND I KNOW THAT.

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:48.288
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS- IN

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:50.423

KNOW IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:38.711
SYSTEM THAT. LAUNCH IS THE

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:41.547
APPRENTICESHIP HUB. IT'S BASED

01:58:41.614 --> 01:58:42.915
IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IT'S THE

01:58:42.982 --> 01:58:45.151
IT'S THE FIRST ONE. THAT REALLY

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:47.553
HELPED COLLEGES OPERATIONALIZE

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:49.288
APPRENTICESHIPS. SO ANOTHER

01:58:49.355 --> 01:58:50.289
APPRENTICESHIP THAT WAS BROUGHT

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:52.158
OVER FROM ANOTHER REGION. THAT

01:58:52.225 --> 01:58:53.125
I HELPED WITH WAS A VERY

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:54.527
CULTURAL OR IF IT A CULTURE

01:58:54.594 --> 01:58:55.995

YOU SENT TO COLLEGE BUT IT WAS

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:03.069
BECAUSE OF THE FACILITATION. OF

THE LAUNCH PROGRAM DIRECTOR IS

01:59:04.770 --> 01:59:06.272
CHARLES HENCKELS BUT THAT'S

01:59:06.339 --> 01:59:08.140
RIGHT IN YOUR REGION. THAT

01:59:08.207 --> 01:59:09.775
COULD BE A MODEL BECAUSE I

01:59:09.842 --> 01:59:11.444
THINK WHAT'S MISSING THIS IS

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:13.279
JUST MY OPINION BUT THE OPERAS

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:14.547

ABLE TO DO SO THAT WOULD BE A

01:59:34.133 --> 01:59:36.969
PERHAPS ANOTHER IDEA TO- MAKE

01:59:37.036 --> 01:59:38.070
SURE THAT IS HAPPENING IN EACH

01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:40.373
