ITEM NUMBER SIX SB SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WHICH IS A HEALTH COMMITTEE BILL. SO WITH THAT -- THE FIRST AND WE WE TAKE THIS AND FILE ORDER SO THE FIRST -- ITEM BEFORE US IS A SENATE BILL TWENTY FOURS -- BY -- SENATOR LABOR PLEASE COME ON UP YEAH. MY ON THE VIDEO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT I WILL BE HAPPILY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT SUGGESTED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THIS US SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. TO THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT PROTECTS A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE AN ABORTION. AS WE ALL KNOW THIS LANDMARK CASE WAS ROE VERSUS WADE. NOW ALMOST A HALF A CENTURY LATER PEOPLE GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONS HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN THINK OF TO RESTRICT ACCESS. AND TO SHAME ANY WOMAN WHO CHOOSES TO HAVE AN ABORTION. THOUGH OUR FORMER GOVERNOR MAY HAVE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE. FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO TRAVEL OFF CAMPUS TO ASK ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION. I RESPECTFULLY AND PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE. MEMBERS JUST THREE YEARS AGO A GROUP OF COMMITTED UC BERKELEY STUDENTS STARTED GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO BRING MEDICATION ABORTION TO THEIR ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. AFTER SPEAKING TO THEIR ADMINISTRATION AND RAISING SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO THAT END. THEY WERE REJECTED BY THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION AT WHICH POINT I WAS ASKED TO LEAD THE EFFORT HERE AT THE CAPITOL. SB TWENTY FOUR IS A CONTINUATION OF THAT EFFORT. THE COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT TO ACT ACCESS ACT WOULD REQUIRE ALL ON CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE MEDICATION FOR EARLY PREGNANCY TERMINATION. FOR THEIR STUDENTS BY JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE RESEARCH FROM UC SAN FRANCISCO ESTIMATES THAT EVERY MONTH FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN STUDENTS AT THE THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES. SICK MEDICATION ABORTIONS ON OUT OF SIGHT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. IF WE TRULY VALUE ACCESS TO ABORTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORT OF SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS THEN IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS EVERY MONTH. ARE ABLE TO ACCESS AS THESE SERVICES ON CAMPUS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE A PATIENT TAKES TWO SETS OF PILLS OVER THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS DURING THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. ACCORDING TO A UC SAN FRANCISCO STUDY MEDICATION ABORTION IS VERY SAFE WITH MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OCCURRING IN ONLY ZERO POINT 3% OF CASES. MAKING IT SAFER THAN TYLENOL OR THOUGH MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTIONS COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES NONE CURRENTLY OFFER ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS. MEDICATION ABORTION IS CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. ACCESS IS SEVERELY LIMITED FOR STUDENTS SINCE ONLY 15%. OF THE CLOSEST OFF CAMPUS ABORTION PROVIDERS ARE OPEN ON WEEKENDS. MEETING THAT STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO MISS CLASS EXAMS AND WORK TO ACCESS ABORTION. WHICH IS SUPREME COURT DETERMINED ALMOST HALF A CENTURY AGO IS A PROTECTED CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL SINCE WOMEN MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST TEN WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. AND MOST WOMEN DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE PREGNANT UNTIL THEY'RE FIVE OR SIX WEEKS ALONG. MEMBERS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ISN'T JUST A SLOGAN BUT RATHER COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING TRUE ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATE INCLUDED COLLEGE STUDENTS. ARE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES HERE WITH ME TODAY IS DOCTOR DANIEL CRESSMAN A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND DIRECTOR OF ADVANCING NEW STANDARDS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAM AND GRACE PAYING A STUDENT AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY [inaudible] DR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE -- AS SENATOR AND MENTION I'M A PHYSICIAN AND PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY AT UCSF -- IN OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM HAS PUBLISHED TWO STUDIES IN PEER REVIEW JOURNALS. RELATED TO THE COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHT TO ACCESS ACT. THE FIRST LOOKED AT HOW OFTEN STUDENTS SEEK ABORTION CARE AND WHETHER THEY FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. STUDENTS ACROSS THE UC AND CSU CAMPUSES OBTAIN APPROXIMATELY THOUSAND WORSENS EACH MONTH. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT AS MANY AS FIVE HUNDRED MEDICATION ABORTIONS WOULD BE PROVIDED MONTHLY ON CAMPUS IS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS OFFER THAT SERVICE. ACROSS ALL PUBLIC UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES CONSIDERING THAT THIS SERVICE REQUIRES TWO VISITS. THE MEDIAN TIME BY PUBLIC PUBLIC TRANSPORT -- TO THE CLOSEST PROVIDER IS TWO HOURS ROUND TRIP FOR MEDICATION ABORTION AND IT'S UP TO FOUR HOURS FOR SOME CAMPUSES. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS TRAVELING MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES FOR HEALTH CARE RENTERS THAT CARE INACCESSIBLE. FOR THE SECOND STUDY WE LOOK AT THE CAPACITY OF THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION ON CAMPUS AND WHAT THEY WOULD NEED. ALL THE UC AND CSU STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS ALREADY PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES -- THE EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACT WITH AT LEAST ONE POSITION -- WORDED VANCE PRACTICE CLINICIAN -- AND THEY HAVE THE NEEDED PHYSICAL SPACE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION THEY WOULD ALL NEED TRAINING -- THEY WITH THE ULTRASOUND IF THAT'S NEEDED -- AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR TELEPHONE SUPPORT TO TRIAGE PATIENTS IF THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE THAT SET UP. GIVEN THESE FINDINGS I BELIEVE THAT ABORTION COMPETE CARE ON CAMPUS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE ACCESS IN DECREASE BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN COMMITTED IT WOULD BE VERY FEASIBLE TO OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION AT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTER. THERE'S NO REASON TO EXCLUDE MEDICATION ABORTION FROM THE CARE THAT IS ALREADY PROVIDED -- AT STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. SENATOR LEVIN NOTED MEDICATION PORTION IS SAFE AND SIMPLE TO PROVIDE OVER THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES OF HAD A MEDICATION ABORTION. AND SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS ARE VERY RARE IN FACT THE HEALTH RISKS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY TO TERM. THAN THEY ARE FOR WOMEN WHO CHOOSE MEDICATION ABORTION. JUST TWO MONTHS AGO. THE FDA APPROVED A NEW GENERIC FORM OF MIFEPRISTONE WHICH IS THE MAIN DRUG USED MEDICATION ABORTION FURTHER CONFIRMING THE AGENCY'S VIEW THAT THIS IS A VERY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. THOUSANDS OF UC AND CSU STUDENTS GET PREGNANT EACH YEAR WHILE ATTENDING SCHOOL AND WITH THE TRAINING -- THAT THIS LEGISLATION WILL MAKE POSSIBLE I BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY WILL ABORTION ACCESS BE EXPANDED FOR STUDENTS BUT THE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS WILL IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. INCLUDING MISCARRIAGE MANAGEMENT TIMELY REFERRALS -- FOR PREGNANCY RELATED COMPLICATIONS. AS WELL AS PROVISION OF A WIDER RANGE OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS GRACE PAYING AND I'M A SOPHOMORE AT SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY ORIGINALLY FROM OAKLAND. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY. THIS YEAR I BEGAN ORGANIZING ON MY CAMPUS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTHCARE INCLUDING ABORTION CARE. AS A LOW INCOME FIRST GENERATION STUDENT OF COLOR IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME TO FIGHT FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE TO THE OTHER STUDENTS DOWN THE LINE DON'T HAVE. TO RIGHT NOW WITH OTHER STATES PASSING LAWS THAT BAN ABORTION CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY WITH SENATE BILL TWENTY FOUR TO BE A LEADER IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE. EVEN IN THE STATE WITHOUT MAJOR ABORTION RESTRICTIONS WE KNOW AS STUDENTS ESPECIALLY STUDENTS OF COLOR STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY PARENTS. STUDENTS STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES STILL FACE OBSTACLES ACCESSING ABORTION. MY CAMPUS HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF HOMELESS STUDENTS IN THE CSU SYSTEM. AN UNACCEPTABLE 13% OF US HAVE UNSTABLE HOUSING. SLEEPING IN CARS AT FRIENDS HOUSES AND IN THE LIBRARY. 42% OF CSU STUDENTS DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS COMING FROM. STUDENTS I KNOW DON'T ALL HAVE CARS ARE ANXIOUS ABOUT GOING TO PROVIDER THAT THEY DON'T KNOW. THE EXTRA COSTS FOR TRANSPORTATION TO AN OFF CAMPUS ABORTION PROVIDER ARTS THE STRESS THAT STUDENTS ARE ALREADY FACING TRYING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS. THIS IS A STUDENT HEALTH ISSUE AND ACADEMIC RETENTION ISSUE AND ULTIMATELY AN EQUITY ISSUE. I SERVE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND I'M PROUD THAT THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ASSOCIATION ENDORSED SB. TWENTY FOUR TOGETHER WITH THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHICH ALSO ENDORSED THE BILL WE REPRESENT MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT SUPPORT ABORTION KAREN CAMPUS.

REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR ITS STUDENTS WE HAVE NOT WAVERED IN OUR RESOLVE HOWEVER YOU SEE DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON SB TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE THERE ARE OUTSTANDING ISSUES. WE ARE WORKING THROUGH WITH THE AUTHOR THE ISSUES ARE PRIMARILY AROUND IMPLEMENTATION IN COST WHILE MOST OF THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION SURROUNDING THE BILL IS CENTERED ON WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THIS IS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE FOR THE UNIVERSITY WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR ON REPEATED OCCASIONS THAT WE SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THE PROBLEMS WITH ACCESS TO THE SERVICE ARE NOT PROXIMITY RATHER THE PROBLEMS FOR THAT REFERRALS HAVE BEEN NOT. HAVE NOT BEEN MADE SEAMLESSLY AND THEY SHOULD BE. FOR THESE REASONS WE UNDERSTAND THE OFFERS I WOULD LIKE TO SERVICE ARE TO BE PROVIDED ON CAMPUS IS DIRECTLY WHICH WILL HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THE INSURANCE CONNECTION TYPE ISSUE STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SOLUTIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE STILL NEED TO SOLVE A FEW PROBLEMS RISEN RELATED TO FUNDING. BEYOND IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE BRING THE SERVICE ON CAMPUS WITHOUT A FUNDING SOURCE BE ON TWENTY TWENTY THREE COULD INCREASE COSTS TO STUDENTS SINCE STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS. ARE SUPPORTED BY STUDENT FEES WE KNOW WE HAVE A CHAMPION. AND A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH SENATOR LABOR'S OFFICE AND ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THESE IT A YEAR -- OUT FUNDING ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI MAGGIE WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY I'LL BE VERY BRIEF WE ARE IN A PENDING POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THE ONGOING DIALOGUE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS AROUND IMPLEMENTATION ON GOING COST LIKE FOUR TO ADDRESS IN THIS COLLABORATIVELY BUT THE AUTHOR STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. TO TEST THE TESTIFIED THAT WILL WILL HAVE OTHERS AND OTHERS IN OPPOSITION AT THAT POINT SO TESTIMONY IN UP IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. SO I WAS BEFORE THREE MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS MARY LEE SHRIDER I'M -- RIGHTS LETTER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RIGHT TO LIFE OF KERN COUNTY AND POLITICAL ADVOCACY CHAIR FOR CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE I'M HERE REALLY DID -- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD LIFE THREE MINUTES TO A DOCTOR BRATS ACTUALLY WE IT'S THREE MINUTES EACH SO. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M DOCTOR STEPHEN BROUGHT. I AM IN A BOARD CERTIFIED OB TO WEIGH IN WITH THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF PRACTICE EXPERIENCE. THE FIRST CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO WAS A NAVY DOCTOR. STATION AT THE MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP PENDLETON AND ALSO SERVED MANY YEARS AT THE NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER IN SAN DIEGO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE OBGYN DEPARTMENT THERE -- MY SERVER THE MARINE CORPS FIRST MEDICAL BATTALION IN THE SOMALIA IN THE IRAQ WAR -- I RETIRED FROM THE NAVY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT MOVED TO SUSANVILLE -- WANTED TO WORK IN AN AREA WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF MEDICAL NEED AND I'VE REALLY ENJOYED PRACTICING THERE FOR THE LAST. ELEVEN YEARS MY WIFE AND I HAVE THREE KIDS OF ALL GRADUATED FROM CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES. WE SERVING ON THE BOARD OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PRO LIFE OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS. WITH MEDICAL ABORTION I COLLEGE CAMPUSES WHAT WILL BE THE RISK FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDICAL ABORTION WE FIND THAT COMPLICATIONS ARE NOT SO RARE. WOMEN WHO TAKE MIFEPRISTONE FOR ABORTION HAVE MUCH GREATER RISK OF HEMORRHAGE IN FATAL INFECTION THE MORE FAILURES REQUIRING EMERGENCY SURGERY THAN WOMEN WHO HAVE SURGICAL ABORTION. THE COMPLICATION RATE. INCLUDING CASES OF HEMORRHAGE INFECTION OR SURGERY WAS PERFORMED IS IN MOST STUDIES REFERENCES WITH THE MASTER AT ARMS THERE ON FILE. IN ONE STUDY THE RATE OF IMAGE WAS 15% ANOTHER 17% OF PATIENTS REQUIRED SURGERY. COMPLICATION RATES COULD BE EVEN HIGHER THAN WE FIND OF THE LITERATURE BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES WITH BILLING CODES IN LARGE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS LOST TO FOLLOW UP IN SOME STUDIES. SO ROUGHLY ONE OUT OF EVERY TWENTY WOMEN WHO HAVE MEDICAL ABORTION WILL HAVE A COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS BLEEDING SOMETIMES RECORDING A BLOOD TRANSFUSION. AND OR NEED NEED FOR SURGERY BECAUSE OF PREGNANCY TISSUE LEFT INSIDE THE UTERUS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND IN THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WERE FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTED TO THE FDA INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR DEATHS NINETY SEVEN ECTOPIC PREGNANCIES. OVER THOUSAND HOSPITALIZATIONS EXCLUDING DEATHS IN FOUR HUNDRED NINETY NINE BUT TRANSFUSIONS AND FORMER TWELVE INFECTIONS. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THESE ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS. I HAVE A WHOLE SIX MINUTES. THE SEVENTY THREE YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES OKAY -- SO THE THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT SOME COMPLICATIONS ARE GOING TO OCCUR. AND THE QUESTION IS ARE WE READY TO HANDLE THOSE COMPLICATIONS. CONTINUITY OF CARE SOMETHING WE STRIVE FOR AND SAFEGUARD PATIENTS TO MAINTAIN QUALITY WITH ESPECIALLY MEDICAL ABORTION PATIENTS HAVING COMPLICATIONS SOMETIMES FIND THAT THE CLINIC IS CLOSED AND SHOW UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IF IF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE IS TELLING PATIENTS TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT'S NOT GOOD CONTINUITY OF CARE -- ULTRASOUND -- PROCEDURES NEED SUPERVISION TRAINING DOCTORS AND NURSES TO DO THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT. AND OF WE'RE REQUIRE A LARGE VOLUME OF PATIENTS -- FOR SUPERVISED ULTRASOUND TRAINING. THIS BILL WANT ME TO STATE ABOVE OBJECTIVES -- MISS FOR STONE ABORTIONS WILL BE INCONVENIENT FOR PATIENTS TAKING MUCH LONGER TO COMPLETE COMPARED WITH SURGICAL ABORTION MEDICAL PORTION OF COURSE A VISIT TO RECEIVE THE DRUGS HOURS OR DAYS OF CRAMPING AND BLEEDING A POSSIBLE YOUR VISIT. AND THEN FOLLOW UP WITH THE CLINIC AGAIN ACCORDING TO DATA COMPILED BY CALIFORNIANS FOR LIFE ABORTION CLINICS LOCATED AN AVERAGE OF ONLY SIX MILES FROM UNIVERSITIES IN CALIFORNIA. HI IS A PHYSICIAN OF CONCERN FOR THE QUALITY OF CARE LACK OF CARE PATIENTS WITH COMPLICATIONS RECEIVE AND FOR THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS ABILITY TO MANAGE THESE COMPLICATIONS AS A CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER VETERAN A PRO LIFE CALIFORNIAN. I POSE AND ASK YOU TO DEFEAT SB TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

ESPECIALLY IN OUR UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE STATE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD. I'M SORRY WE WERE ON THE IMPRESSION THAT IF I YIELDED HE COULD HAVE ALL SIX CAN I CAN I HAVE A MINUTE. YOU COULD HAVE ONE MINUTE I CAN IN ONE MINUTE VERY GOOD -- IN COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON THE BILL WITNESS TESTIMONY AND LEGISLATORS INQUIRE HE'S FOCUSED ON MEDICATION ABORTIONS PERCEIVED IMPEDIMENTS TO PREGNANT STUDENTS ACCESS TO SUCH ABORTIONS AND RELATED COSTS AND LIABILITY CONCERNS. HOWEVER AT NO TIME HAS ANYONE POSE THE MOST RELEVANT QUESTION IS ABORTION MEDICATION BY TECHNIQUES THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD IN REACHING THE STATED GOALS OF SB. TWENTY FOUR RESEARCH BY RECOGNIZED EXPERTS IN OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY STRONGLY INDICATES IT IS NOT IN HIS VETO MESSAGE OF SB THREE TWENTY GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN DISMISSED THE BILL AS A NECESSARY. BUT HE WAS ONLY HALF CORRECT NOT ONLY ARE ABORTIONS MY MEDICATION TECHNIQUES UNNECESSARY ON COLLEGE CAMPUS THEIR COUNTRY INDICATED. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS A PRO CHOICE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION WITHIN FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND MEMBERS WOMEN WHO DESIRE QUICK ABORTION QUICK COMPLETION OF THE ABORTION PROCESS. ARE NOT CONSIDERED GOOD CANDIDATES FOR MEDICAL ABORTIONS ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT -- ANYTHING THAT THE FACT THAT ANYTHING SPEECH GUNS ABORTIONS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT DOES NOT PRECLUDE CITIZENS FROM IMPLEMENTING SOME LIMITED RESTRICTIONS -- LAW ABIDING PERMIT CARRYING GUN OWNERS CANNOT CURE THEIR GUNS EVERYWHERE THEY WISH. INCLUDING INTO THIS CAPITOL BUILDING AND AS A MATTER OF CONSISTENCY. IT IS NOT THE STATE'S ROLE TO MAKE SURE CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT HOLDERS HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE FIREARMS THEY DESIRE THEN IT IS LIKE WHY IS NOT THE STATE'S ROLE TO MANDATE. THE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE NEVER INCONVENIENCED IN PURSUIT OF UNLIMITED ACCESS TO ABORTIONS NOR IS IT STATES ROLE TO MANDATE THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES BE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ABORTIONS ON THEIR PREMISES. AND FURTHER MORE TO BE OPEN TO USING STUDENT FEES TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WAS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. HI SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS BILL BACK AGAIN INTO THE LEGISLATURE I'M PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. FOR SB TWENTY FOUR AND HAVE SOME PREPARED REMARKS THAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE. IN LIGHT OF RECENT EVENTS IN ALABAMA LOUISIANA GEORGIA IT IS OUR DUTY AS LEGISLATORS TO UPHOLD AND PROTECT THE GUARANTEED RIGHTS TO ABORTION AXIS. THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER ATTACK NOT ONLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I WOULD SAY AROUND THE WORLD. SB TWENTY FOUR WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT IT'S PROTECTED FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THAT THE RIGHT IT'S UP HELD. THROUGH ALL ALL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING SEE ISSUES AND UC'S. BASIC HEALTH SERVICES EVEN ON THE CSU IN THE UC CAMPUSES INCLUDE PREGNANCY COUNSELING CONTRACEPTIVES. AND OTHER REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES BUT ARBITRARILY BUT ARBITRARILY STOP SHORT OF MEDICATION ABORTIONS. THIS LACK OF AXIS. COST IS UNNECESSARY LOGISTICAL AND FINANCIAL STRESS TO DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT ONLY IMPACTS WOMEN. THIS IS AN AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS BOTH PARTNERS IN THAT SITUATION BOTH MALE AND FEMALE. THE LACK OF AXES CLEARLY IS AN ISSUE ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL FACILITIES AND TREATMENTS OFF CAN'T MISS ARE OFTEN NOT AN OPTION GIVEN THAT 51% OF STUDENTS AND ROLLED ACROSS THE ISSUES IN U. S. AND UC'S. ARE LOW INCOME AND A PORTION OF UC STUDENTS AND SEE IF YOU STUDENTS TO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION. ALLOWING ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES GUARANTEES A SAFE OUTLET FOR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. WHO DESERVE ACCESS TO THESE LIFE ALTERING TREATMENTS AT THE UNIVERSITIES WHERE THEY ARE SAFE? AND IN A SOUND PLACE. OFFERING MEDICATION ABORTION AT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WILL ENSURE THE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS IT'S PRIORITIZE. STUDENTS MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION ACCESS AND THEY MUST BE GIVEN THE NECESSARY SERVICES REQUIRED TO FOCUS ON AND PURSUE. THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS I AM PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR FOR SB. TWENTY FOUR AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN THE RIGHTS TO REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE. AND INCOME AND ENSURE THAT THE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE ALSO EQUALLY AS RESPONSIBLE -- ARE ALSO AT THE TABLE AND ENSURE THAT THEIR PARTNERS ARE SAFE -- AT THE COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS UP AGAIN. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISS WALDRON [inaudible] SO -- I KNOW THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL BEFORE. NO WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT. THERE'S SERVICES WITHIN UNDER FIVE MILES TO SEVEN MILES OF THIRTY THREE OR SO OF THE CAMPUSES ALREADY -- SO SINCE SERVICES A WIDELY AVAILABLE IN NEARBY. HE DEEMED THE BILL ON NECESSARY AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WOULD BE. NOTHING'S CHANGED IN THAT REGARD. AS I STATED IN MY OPENING I PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR AND IT'S NOT MEDICAID ABORTION OR PORTION IN FACT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE -- WITHIN ALL THIRTY FOUR CAMPUSES SO THE GOVERNOR AND I DON'T AGREE HE VETOED IT AND WE'RE BACK OKAY SO. I KNOW THE GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO MAKE ABORTION RARE. BUT DOING THIS WILL ACTUALLY. MAKE IT EASIER SO I'M JUST YOU KNOW THE AND THAT'S JUST A STATEMENT OF MINE. BUT I WANTED TO ASK THE DOCTOR -- THE OP OPPONENTS. IF I MAY -- SO. AT AND I'VE YOU KNOW DONE RESEARCH BECAUSE I HAD A BILL COUPLE YEARS AGO REGARDING THE ARE YOU. FORTY SIX AS WELL -- SO. AND YOU KNOW YOU WOULD NOW I MEAN IF SOMEONE TAKES THIS MEDICATION. THERE'S GOING TO BE BLEEDING. THERE'S GOING TO BE PAYING THERE'S GOING TO BE -- POSSIBLE ISSUES LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S SOMETIMES SEVERE CONDITIONS. BASICALLY THE BABY HAS TO BE EXPELLED. AND THAT COULD HAPPEN IN THE DORM BATHROOM WELL THE GIRL LONG. AND I'M A MOM AND I YOU KNOW THEY'RE CONSIDERED ADULTS AT EIGHTEEN AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A SON WHO'S EIGHTEEN AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT THEY CAN. REALLY MAKE ADULT DECISIONS. BUT MY HEART GOES OUT TO THESE YOUNG WOMEN WHO WILL BE ALONE IN THE DORM [inaudible] EXPONENT CHILD. IN A AND ONE IS THE DOCTOR I MEAN WHAT HAPPENS. WHAT'S THE REALITY OF TAKING THIS PILL. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN A WOMAN TAKES THE PILLS INVOLVED IN THE MEDICAL ABORTION PROCEDURE. SHE IS GOING TO EXPERIENCE PRETTY SEVERE CRAMPING VERY HEAVY BLEEDING THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE UPON THAT PATIENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT. SOMETIMES THE BLEEDING IS SO SEVERE THAT PATIENTS NEED TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM SOMETIMES JUST FOR REASSURANCE THAT THERE THERE THERE'S NOT HEMORRHAGING TO THE POINT OF NEEDING. MEDICAL ASSISTANCE BUT SOMETIMES THEY ARE BLEEDING THAT HEAVILY THAT THEY DO NEED AN URGENT PROCEDURE. TO COMPLETE THE ABORTION TO REMOVE TISSUE FROM THE WOMB -- AND SOMETIMES EVEN A BLOOD TRANSFUSION THE FACT IS THAT IF CURRENTLY WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES ARE IN LIVING SITUATIONS WHERE TRANSPORTATION IS DIFFICULT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT THEY WOULD BE THE WORST CANDIDATES. FOR THIS KIND OF PROCEDURE THEY MAY END UP BY THEMSELVES BLEEDING HEAVILY IN A LOT OF PAIN MAYBE NOT ABLE. TO GET TO A PHONE OR GET TO TO THE HELP THEY NEED -- THEY WOULD BE THE THE WORST -- CANDIDATES FOR THIS KIND OF PROCEDURE AND AND IT'S GONNA REQUIRE AS I SAID MORE TIME FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THE ABORTION PROCEDURE THAN SAY IF THEY HAD GONE FIRST. A FIRST TRIMESTER SURGICAL ABORTION THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- JUST AS A FOLLOW UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAY ALSO A MAN ALSO RESPOND. WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROCEDURE IS OFFERED ON CAMPUS WOMEN WILL STILL AND STUDENTS WILL STILL HAVE MEANT -- MEDICATED ABORTION THEY WILL GO OFF CAMPUS TO GET THE MEDICATION AND THEY WILL COME BACK AND THEY WILL STILL BE IN THEIR DORM ROOM SO THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT. WELL. IT'S MAKING IT MUCH MORE AVAILABLE. ISN'T ISN'T THE POINT I WAS MAKING THAT IS CORRECT. WHAT KIND OF SUPERVISION IS THEIR MEDICALLY ON THE CAMPUS WHERE AT LEAST? YOU KNOW THEY GO TO A DOCTOR. THEY HAVE SOME WAY THEY CAN CONTACT THE DOCTOR -- FOR THE NURSE. AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO CONTACT THE HEALTH CENTER AS WELL. SO EVEN AFTER HOURS YES SIR IT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO A FEW IF THEY OBTAIN THE MEDICATION OFF CAMPUS AND SOMETHING HAPPENED AT ONE AM IN THE MORNING. THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM WHETHER THEY OBTAIN THE MEDICATION ON CAMPUS OR OFF CAMPUS SO THAT DOESN'T CHANGE. SO THE I MEAN. THE IN THE PHYSICIAN WORLD I'M NOT YOU CAN PRETEND TO BE A PHYSICIAN. HOW LATE IN THE PREGNANCY CAN THEY DO ARE YOU CAN WICKS FOUR EIGHTY SIX A TEN WEEK TEN WEEKS SO AT TEN WEEKS? A PRE BORN CHILD HAS A BEATING HEART. ARMS AND LEGS [inaudible] FEET [inaudible] HANDS. I'M JUST YOU KNOW THE MOM IT'S SYSTEMATIC TO THINK OF A YOUNG GIRL ALONE. WHEN THAT HAPPENS SO I MEAN FOR ME I JUST THINK? AND I'LL JUST MAKE MY STATEMENT SB THREE TWENTY DOES NOTHING FOR PREGNANT STUDENTS WHO WANT TO KEEP THEIR BABIES IN THE HELP TO DO SO. THE ONLY ASSISTANCE THE UNIVERSITY WILL GIVE THEM HIS. HAVING ABORTIONS SO WE ALREADY PROVIDE PREGNANCY COUNSELING COUNSELING ON ON A CAMPUS THAT WOULD NOT CHANGE. AND DID THEY REFER THEM TO CRISIS PREGNANCY CENTERS OR THEY MAY THEY MAY NOT I DON'T KNOW WHAT EACH CAMPUS TO SPECIFICALLY BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY OFFER PREGNANCY COUNSELING. SO I I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING A BEFORE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER LEYVA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR ATTENTION IN YOUR DISCUSSION. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL IS NOT ASKING ANY WOMAN TO HAVE AN ABORTION THIS BILL IS STILL MAKING SURE WOMAN HAS HER RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO. IT IS IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN TRAVELING OFF CAMPUS DOES IT MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE ABSOLUTELY IT DOES THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL. AND SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENTS IN LIFE AND THAT'S OKAY -- WELL OTHER STICKS OR TAKING A GIANT LEAP BACKWARD TO THE DAYS OF FORCED PREGNANCY AND MISOGYNY SB TWENTY FOUR WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD. BY REAFFIRMING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF COLLEGE CARE WITHOUT DELAY.

DH CS FAMILY BACK SERVICES INCLUDE ALL FDA APPROVED CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTIVES TESTING AND TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS.

THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM SERVES ONE POINT ONE MILLION LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH TWO TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS CURRENTLY FAMILY PACK IS FUNDED BY A NINETY TEN FEDERAL MATCH. MEANING THAT FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED IN FAMILY PLANNING CARE THE STATE RECEIVES NINETY CENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS FEDERAL PROPOSALS HAVE CALLED FOR SHIFTING ALL FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDING TO STATES TO A BLOCK GRANT FORM IF SUCH PROPOSALS WERE TO BE IMPLEMENTED THE CURRENT MATCH FOR FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. COULD BE THREATENED WITHOUT A PLAN IN PLACE ACCESS TO FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME AN UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS COULD BE DISRUPTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY READ AND REDUCED. SB THRILL ONE PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT PLAN. IN THE EVENT OF REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL FUNDING SB THREE OH ONE WOULD REQUIRE DH CS TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF ANY FEDERAL ACTION.

IN THAT THIRTY YEAR SPAN CALIFORNIA REDUCE ITS TEEN PREGNANCY RATE BY 70%. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY ATTACKED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE STEPS TO PLAN FOR ALL SCENARIOS. INCLUDING A POTENTIAL FUNDING LOSS FOR THE FAMILY PACK PROGRAM. TO PROTECT ACCESS TO VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY ENACTED SEVERAL MEASURES MEASURES TO HOLD THE LINE AND PROTECT ACCESS IN THE FACE OF HOSTILE ACTIONS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF SB EIGHT SEVEN FOUR SIX REQUIRES HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROVIDERS. THAT ALREADY COVER CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY TO COVER ANTI CANCER MEDICAL DEVICES AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TUMOR TREATING FIELDS TTF THERAPY IS A BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT OF SOLID TUMOR CANCERS. IT HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT OF GEO BLAST DONNA BRAIN CANCER AND THE RIGOROUS FEDERAL. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION PRE MARKET APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CLASS THREE MEDICAL DEVICES. GBM IS MOST COMMON AN AGGRESSIVE PRIMARY BRAIN CANCER IN PROGRESSIVE RAPIDLY. TTF THERAPY HAS BEEN PROVEN TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXTEND THE LIVES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF GBM PATIENTS GETTING CARE EARLY. AND IMMEDIATELY IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DEVICE IN JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. NOW THAT ANTI CANCER MEDICAL DEVICES ARE A BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICE AND THE TREATMENT OF CANCER IN SHOULD BE COVERED. SB SEVEN FORTY SIX WILL MAKE IT CLEAR AND COLD THAT HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER ANTI CANCER MEDICAL DEVICES IF THE ALREADY COVER CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. THE SB SEVEN FORTY SIX ALSO DEFINES AN ANTI CANCER MEDICAL DEVICE AS A DEVICE THAT IS APPROVED. BY THE FEDERAL FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION USE PRIMARILY OUTSIDE OF A MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITY. INDETERMINATE SHOULD BE NECESSARY IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. THESE DEVICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN REPEATED STUDIES AND TO APPROVED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THEIR USE NATIONWIDE SO IT IS CRITICAL FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. TO COVER THESE DEVICES QUICKLY FOR INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM GBM OR OTHER TYPES OF CANCER WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JUSTIN KELLY WITH NO WILL CURE. WHO CAN ANSWER ANY THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEVICE AND HOW IT OPERATES? MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. SORRY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JUSTIN CALLIE AND THE LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I'M HERE -- TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PASSING THIS BILL -- CLEAR BLAST ALMOST MULTI FORM IS THE DISEASE THAT KILLED SENATORS TED KENNEDY AND JOHN MCCAIN. AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON BEAU. OPPORTUNE AS AN ANTI CANCER DEVICE FDA APPROVED FOR THE TREATMENT BOTH WERE CURRENT AS WELL AS NEWLY DIAGNOSED CLEO BLAST FROM A BRAIN TUMORS IT'S INCLUDED IN THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK -- GUIDELINES FOR BOTH NEWLY DIAGNOSED WERE CURRENTLY -- BLAST OMA IN HIS PART OF THE GPL MARKLEY LESS FROM A STANDARD OF CARE. VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR INSURANCE CARRIER IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY MEDICAID PROGRAMS INCLUDING MEDICAL HAVE PUBLISHED COVERAGE POLICIES. OF FOR THIS THERAPY AT THIS POINT IN TIME MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION AMERICANS ARE COVERED FOR TO RETREATING FIELDS IN THE EVENT OF A PLEA -- BLAST FROM A DIAGNOSIS. BOB TUNE IS OFTEN COVERED SOME PLANTS COVER INCONSISTENTLY -- OFTEN TO THE GREAT DETRIMENT OF PATIENT TO PURCHASE THEIR PLANS ON THE INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL GROUP MARKET. ALL PATIENTS WERE COVERED THROUGH LARGE GROUP OR EMPLOYER PLANS ARE TYPICALLY COVERED THIS IS RESULTED IN PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT INSURED THROUGH -- THROUGH LARGE EMPLOYERS HAVING TO FOREGO TREATMENT HAD A POCKET OR SEEK ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES FOR STANDARD OF CARE TREATMENT. THAT FOR MANY PATIENTS IS ARE ONLY AVAILABLE OPTION -- I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LETTER FROM -- WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY FROM WATSONVILLE RESIDENT. LIVING WITH WILL LAST A MONTH HE PURCHASES HEALTH PLAN TO COVER CALIFORNIA AND RAN INTO THE ISSUE THIS BILL INTENSE DEFECTS. I BELIEVE HIS LETTER UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION AND THE REAL HUMAN IMPACT THIS ISSUE HAS ON SOME CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY THIS BILL. IT TOOK THIRTEEN MONTHS -- TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE FOR HIM THROUGH THE APPEAL PROCESS AND THESE ARE PATIENTS WERE BATTLING A DEADLY DISEASE AND FRANKLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO NAVIGATE. A LENGTHY APPEALS PROCESS IN THESE INSTANCES. THE TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE WHEN THEY CONSIDER THIS BILL WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES INDICATING THAT ALL PLANTS COVER THE TREATMENT. I KNOW IF THIRTY INSTANCES OF THE LAST THREE YEARS WERE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WERE DENIED CARE. DUE TO THE AMBIGUITY THIS BILL INTENDS TO CLARIFY. INCLUDING THREE RESIDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY NAVIGATING THE APPEALS PROCESS TODAY. IN CLOSING THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE WE UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE IMPACTS VERY FEW CALIFORNIANS. BUT FOR THOSE THAT IT DOES IMPACT. THE MAGNITUDE CAN BE CATASTROPHIC BOTH MEN -- MEDICALLY AS WELL AS FINANCIALLY. IT'S DIAGNOSED WITH GLIOBLASTOMA HAVE VERY FEW OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS LEGISLATION TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE COMPARABLE ACCESS INTO CANCER MEDICAL DEVICES. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN DENNIS CARDOZA REPRESENTING FOLEY AND LARDNER AND KNOW WE CARE IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE BEEN HERE SINCE I WAS A MEMBER OF THIS A GLASS BODY TESTIFYING AND THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER TESTIMONY I JUST WANNA -- SAY THAT WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NO ONE ANSWERED OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. STEPHANIE WHY CAN SOMEBODY HAVE THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES REGRETTABLY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION. TO UNDERSCORE WHAT WAS TESTIFIED TO EARLIER WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY OF OUR MEMBERS CURRENTLY THAT ARE NOT COVERING THIS AND TREATMENT I THINK THERE WERE SOME ISSUES AND CLARIFICATIONS THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS YEAR. I KNOW THE INDIVIDUALLY PLANS HAVE GONE INTO THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO TRY AND SHARE THAT. IT IS NOW COVERED -- MOST RECENTLY KAISER HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT IS COVERED THEREFORE IT IS A PART OF THE BENCHMARK PLAN. WITH THAT WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH -- WITHIN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL ROUP MARKET THAT WOULD BE -- REQUIRED COVERAGE FOR ALL OTHER PLANS SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SPONSORS THAT THERE'S INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES FOR WHICH WE CAN LEND SOME SUPPORT THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS A REQUIRED COVERAGE UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP BENCHMARK PLANT. SO WITH THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION WE THINK IT'S UNNECESSARY IN THE CONTEXT THAT IF WE START -- TO CODIFY ALL INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT MODALITIES CERTAINLY THAT WILL OPEN THIS UP TO A MUCH BROADER CONVERSATION IN THE CONCERNED SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER ONLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS I'D LIKE TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES. I MISSED WHAT CANS BUT REALLY I MEAN THIS IS A CASE WHERE IT IS AN EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT THE BENCHMARK PLAN. IS A KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY'RE COVERING IT ALL OTHER PLANTS IN THE SMALL MARCH ERIC THIS SMALL AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET. SHOULD BE COVERING THE SERVICE AND SO WE DO HAVE A REAL CONCERN JUST ABOUT TO KEY TAG EVEN OUR KNOCKS KEEN ACT WITH WITH SERVICES AND DEVICES THAT ARE COVERED [inaudible] THANK YOU. THERE ARE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WHICH IS A LINER COMMENTS WITH BACK LOOKING CAP. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE -- WE DO HAVE -- I'M I'M CURIOUS I I DO HAVE A QUESTION SO [inaudible] SO. THE HEALTH PLANS YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS COVERED AND SO THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY SO. IS THAT WHY IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH. WE HAVE I HAVE TALKED TO THE THE PROPONENTS AND THERE THERE DO APPEAR TO BE STILL PEOPLE WHO DON'T. PLANS IT DON'T GET IT FOR WHATEVER REASON WE'RE NOT COVERING FOR WHATEVER REASON SO YOU'RE SAYING IT'S COVERED AND EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING IT. WHY SHOULD WHY OTHER PLANTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY DOING THAT AND SO WHY SHOULD WE NOT STATE THIS INTO INTO LAW TO TO ENSURE THAT ITS IT THAT IT IS BEING FOLLOWED? I THINK A RESPONSE WOULD BE I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S PLENTY OF INSTANCES FROM WHICHSOMETHING IS CLEARLY COVERED AND THERE IS AN ISSUE AND THERE'S A REGULATORY PROCESS BOTH THEIR CDI AND TEAMMATES SEE. TO GO THROUGH THAT IF IF WE WERE TO CODIFY EVERY INSTANCE FOR WHICH THERE WAS A ONE OFF WHERE THERE WAS A MISTAKE IN COVERAGE OR AN ISSUE. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NOT SKINNER AND INSURANCE COULD WOULD LOOK LIKE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHAT OUR CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S A WHOLE REGULATORY. PROCESS IN ORDER TO SET FOR THE BENCHMARK PLAN TO ITEMIZE WHAT COVERAGE LOOKS LIKE AND THAT'S BETTER PLACED IN THAT REGULATORY PROCESS AND ALSO HAVING THE I AM OUR PROCESS FOR SECONDARY LOOK AT THAT GIVES. INDIVIDUALS AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN THERE ARE CONCERNS OR PROBLEMS LEGISLATING EVERY TIME THAT THERE'S A ONE OFF MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE HERE QUITE OFTEN TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING IS NECESSARY OR NOT AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. KIND OF WINNERS AND LOSERS PEOPLE WHO GET THERE DEVICE OR THE MODALITY CODIFIED VERSUS THOSE THAT DON'T I THINK THAT'S OUR GENERAL CONCERN. WELL IT'S A I SHARE SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL -- I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE EVERY YEAR. LOOKING AT DIFFERENT INDIVIDUAL DEVICES BUT I I THINK WHAT I JUST HEARD YOU SAY IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S COVERED. OR MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T GET THE COVERAGE AND THAT'S I THINK THAT IS TO THE POINT OF WHAT THE PROPONENTS HER ASKING MISTER DISCOVERY OF ETIQUETTE. IF IT'S A COVERED BENEFIT -- I'M SO I'M JUST. FIVE NINE AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT COULD OCCUR. FOR A PLAN TO A WHEN REVIEWING THE REQUEST FOR ANY YOU KNOW A DEVICE OR INCLUDING THIS DEVICE. OR MAYBE THERE WASN'T -- INITIALLY THERE WASN'T ENOUGH INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY THE% PROVIDER TO DOCUMENT MEDICAL NECESSITY I MEAN THERE'S JUST DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THAT WOULD BE. THAT IT WOULD BE EXAMINED BY THE PLAN BUT AGAIN THAT'S WHY THERE IS THE INTERNAL APPEALS PROCESS. AND OF THE I AM OUR PROCESS AT THE DEPARTMENT TO KIND TO RESOLVE THOSE WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WILL JUDGING BY THE THE AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF A DISEASE LIKE THIS AND THE LENGTH OF APPEALS -- THAT MIGHT TAKE I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE PROPONENTS THAT WE WANT ONE APPEAL TOOK THIRTEEN MONTHS -- AND CONSIDERING THE THE EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF AN ADDITION LIKE THIS -- I'D. I FEEL SO. FEELS PRETTY PRETTY ROUGH ON THE PATIENT QUITE FRANKLY SO -- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SPEAK PART OF THAT -- BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM. MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU'VE HIT. PRECISELY THE PROBLEM THE WERE AFTER -- OFTENTIMES OF THESE PATIENTS ARE GETTING THE TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY -- THEY MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE TREATMENT THREE FOUR FIVE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD. THIS TAKES ALL -- EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS WE HEARD THIS SAME TESTIMONY IN THE SENATE. AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NO ONE NOT COVERING IT BUT AS WE TESTIFIED EARLIER MISTER MY COLLEAGUE MISTER KELLY TESTIFIED. THERE ARE THREE PEOPLE CURRENTLY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THAT -- HAVE BEEN ADDED I COVERAGE ARE GOING THROUGH APPEAL PROCESS THIS IS NOT A SITUATION OF THOSE PATIENTS HAVE THE TIME. TO BE DILLY DALLYING AROUND WITH THE APPROVAL PROCESS WE NEED TO TREATMENT AS SOON AS ARE DIAGNOSED SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TINA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I YES I I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FRIEND I BELIEVE AND I THINK -- I WAS DRIVEN TO TAKE THIS -- HAVING EXPERIENCE WITH A CLOSE FRIEND WHO DID PASS AWAY WITH THIS PARTICULAR DISEASE AND THE SIGNIFICANCE IS THERE OF THE REPEATED TEA AT WHICH THIS DEVICE NEEDS TO BE APPLIED. SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH OUT AND THE APPEAL PROCESS DOES NOT SERVE THEM WELL SO IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE'LL GET AN AYE VOTE IN AND MOVE THE BILL ALONG THANK YOU.
