LICENSEES TO REPORT JUDGMENTS

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.140
ARBITRATION AWARDS ARE SEGMENT

00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.775

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.577
STUDY.

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.445
SO THAT'S HOW I CAME BACK HERE

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:09.880
HOW DO PEOPLE LIVING ABOUT ME

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:10.981

BALCONIES.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.584
BECAUSE IF THE STUDENTS HAVE

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.753
BEEN KNOWN THAT THESE BALCONIES

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:17.955
WERE BUILT BY SEGWAY.

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.323
AND THAT'S LIKELY BEEN REPEATED

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.191
THE SUIT TO HONESTLY THINK THEY

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:21.759

SIX MILLION.

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.900
YOU PROBABLY UNDER THE SAME KIND

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:30.534

MENTIONED S. B. FORM FOR SIXTY

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.809

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.482
THROUGH IMPORTANT IS ONE MILLION

00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:47.618
THAT'S ALL IT IS AND APPLIES

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:49.420

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:10.207
SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:12.042
MY UNDERSTANDING AFTER A LOT OF

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:13.277

00:45:24.354 --> 00:45:26.457
HOW CAN THE CONTRACTORS LICENSE

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:29.393
THE PUBLIC IF THEY DON'T HAVE

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.794

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.729
THEY CURRENTLY RECEIVE ABOUT

WHAT HAPPENED IN BERKELEY.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:12.936
THE REASON THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:14.371
WANT THESE REFORMS TO GO TRUE

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:15.272

AFTER LOOKING AT SO MUCH DATA I

00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:30.721
THINK THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:32.189
SHOULD WANT TO REPRESENT A SAFE

00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:33.257
INDUSTRY.

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:35.092

AND HE USED HIS POSITION OF

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.178
POWER TO ORDER THE NURSE OUT OF

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:15.979
THE ROOM.

00:50:16.046 --> 00:50:19.249
AND SEXUALLY ABUSED ME.

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.684
DECADES LATER I FIND OUT THAT I

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.119

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.777
HIM TO CONTINUE HIS ABUSE.

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:48.378

MISS FRIEDMAN.

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.325

BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:25.732
SOME OF MY CONCERNS I HOPE THAT

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:27.134
YOU CAN WORK SOME OF THESE

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.335
ISSUES OUT SOME OF THEM ARE JUST

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:29.670
QUESTIONS AND SOME I THINK OUR

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:30.604
WORDING ISSUES.

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:33.473
I'M ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS --

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.742
WHAT HAPPENS TO AN INGREDIENT IF

01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:37.210
ANOTHER COMPANY OR ANOTHER

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.645
ENTITY TESTS IT SOMEWHERE IN THE

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:39.680
WORLD WITHOUT?

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:41.615
THAT PARTICULAR MANUFACTURERS

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.649
KNOWLEDGE OR WITHOUT THEIR

01:43:42.716 --> 01:43:43.850
PARTICIPATION DOES THAT MEAN

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:45.152
THAT THAT INGREDIENT THEN

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.787
BECOMES BAND IN THE STATE EVEN

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:47.187
THOUGH [inaudible]

01:43:47.254 --> 01:43:50.991
IF COSMETIC COMPANY A DOZEN

01:43:51.058 --> 01:43:52.492
TESTS ON ANIMALS NEVER DID AND

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:54.361
THAN COSMETIC COMPANIES SEE IN

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:56.096
SOME OTHER COUNTRY TEST THE SAME

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:56.997
AGREE ON ANIMALS AS I MEAN.

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:58.966
THAT THAT IS.

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:00.534
ABANDONED IT IN OUR IN

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.369
CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S A QUESTION

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.137
THAT'S NOT IN THE BILL SO.

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:05.439
I'D YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU

01:44:05.505 --> 01:44:06.907
INTEND THAT IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:08.208
STORY BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:09.876
DEALT WITH SOMEWHERE IN THE TEXT

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:10.611
OF THE BILL SO THAT THERE'S

01:44:10.677 --> 01:44:11.311
CLARITY.

01:44:11.378 --> 01:44:13.113
SO THAT'S NUMBER.

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.748
ONE IT'S TESTED OUTSIDE OF THE

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.550
PARTICULAR MANUFACTURERS --

01:44:16.617 --> 01:44:18.385
PURVIEW SECONDLY IN TERMS OF THE

01:44:18.452 --> 01:44:19.620
FAR EXEMPTION I COULD BE WRONG

01:44:19.686 --> 01:44:21.154
BUT WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD IS THAT

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:22.155
THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THAT IF

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:22.556
YOU.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:24.591
AND WITH CHINA IS THAT A PRODUCT

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:26.360
IS MANUFACTURED INSIDE OF CHINA

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:27.294
I GUESS BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:28.462
EXTREMELY HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:29.997
STANDARDS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:31.632
TESTED ON ANIMALS BUT IF IT'S

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:33.166
POSTED OUTSIDE OF CHINA IT DOES

01:44:33.233 --> 01:44:34.234
SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FOR

01:44:34.301 --> 01:44:35.502
MANUFACTURERS.

01:44:35.569 --> 01:44:36.737
THEIR ONLY CHOICE IS GOING TO BE

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:39.873
TO MAKE DE THEIR NOT SO TO CHINA

01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:40.507
OR MANUFACTURE INSIDE OF CHINA.

01:44:40.574 --> 01:44:41.108
AND I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:42.576
THAT'S A REAL ISSUE --

01:44:42.643 --> 01:44:44.411
SO IF YOUR INTENTION IS AND I'M

01:44:44.478 --> 01:44:45.946
I LET YOU ANSWER THIS ONE IS

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:46.813
YOUR ATTENTION IS THAT IT'S FINE

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.248
IF ALL THE MAIN.

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:49.416
CHINA BECAUSE THEN THERE'S NO

01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:50.751
ANIMAL TESTING.

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:51.818
THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:53.286
BILL THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT THE

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:55.088
INTENTION AND AYE THE THERE ARE

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:56.823
CONVERSATION STILL OCCURRING

01:44:56.890 --> 01:44:58.425
ABOUT WHAT THAT TIMELINE IS WITH

01:44:58.492 --> 01:44:59.960
THE TIMELINE DOESN'T MATTER AND

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:01.728
HEALTH WHERE YOU'RE BASICALLY

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:02.329
SAYING WITH THAT BY FOR YEARS

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:02.763
THEY HAVE.

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:03.797
TO CHINA IF THEY'RE GONNA SELL

01:45:03.864 --> 01:45:05.232
TO CHINA BECAUSE A HALF THE

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.266
PRODUCTS HAVE TO BE TESTED ON

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.100
ANIMALS TO BE IMPORTED INTO

01:45:07.167 --> 01:45:08.869
CHINA.

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.470
SO THE TIME I JUST MEANS THAT

01:45:10.537 --> 01:45:11.338
THEY HAVE ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS

01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:12.439
THEY CAN OPERATE HERE AND SO

01:45:12.506 --> 01:45:14.241
IMPORTANT CHINA AFTER THAT THEY

01:45:14.307 --> 01:45:16.309
HAVE TO MOVE OR NOT SELL YES I'M

01:45:16.376 --> 01:45:18.278
GONNA ALLOW MY SPONSOR TO TO

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:19.880
RESPOND TO THAT BUT FIRST LET ME

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:21.281
RESPOND TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION.

01:45:21.348 --> 01:45:22.983
WHICH WAS WITH REGARD TO ANOTHER

01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:23.817
COMPANY TAKING ANOTHER

01:45:23.884 --> 01:45:26.887
INGREDIENT I AND TESTING IT ON

01:45:26.953 --> 01:45:31.391
ANIMALS AND THAT FIRST COMPANY

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:31.925
DOESN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:32.192
OCCURRED.

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:32.893
WE DID TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:33.760
SAY THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:36.063
LIABLE IF WAS TESTED BY SOME

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:37.664
OTHER COMPANY.

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:39.366
IF THAT NEEDS TO BE TIGHTENED UP

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:40.667
WE CAN LOOK AT THAT YEAH THAT'S

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:42.169
NO BIG SO EVEN IF THEY KNOW

01:45:42.235 --> 01:45:43.704
THOUGH WHETHER THEY KNOW OR NOT

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.038
IS NOT YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT

01:45:45.105 --> 01:45:46.807
RELEVANT IF ANOTHER IF THEY HAVE

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.075
THAT AS AN INGREDIENT AND THEY

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:49.609
KNOW THAT SOMEONE ELSE TESTS IT.

01:45:49.676 --> 01:45:50.610
THEN THEY STILL CAN'T USE IT

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:51.845
EVEN IF IT'S TESTED AFTER THE

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.080
MAIN THEY INTRODUCED IT

01:45:53.146 --> 01:45:54.548
ACCORDING TO YOUR BILL SO I'M

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:55.348
JUST SAYING I THINK THAT

01:45:55.415 --> 01:45:57.951
SOMETHING SO FIVE BY HAVE MY

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.019
PRODUCT AND I'VE INTRODUCED IT.

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:00.620
AND THEN WHATEVER OF SOMETIMES

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:02.055
SOME OTHER COMPANY TESTED ON

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:03.256
ANIMALS THAT MEANS I HAVE TO

01:46:03.323 --> 01:46:04.124
PULL IT OFF THE SHELF RIGHT EVEN

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:04.758
THOUGH I DIDN'T HAVE TROLL OVER

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.193
THAT.

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:08.328
NO IT IS NOT WE TOOK AMENDMENTS

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:09.463
TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY AND

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:10.464
IT'S NOT DETAILED IN THE

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:12.399
APPROPRIATIONS ANALYSIS BUT WE

01:46:12.466 --> 01:46:13.233
DID.

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:15.001
TAKE AMENDMENTS TO THAT EFFECT

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:16.203
SORT LOT AND I'LL WELL THAT WE

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.471
HAVE IN PRINT IT'S A DIFFERENCE

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:19.339
NOT IT'S NOT REFLECT IS NOT IN

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:21.041
THE ANALYSIS WELFARE SO I REALLY

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:23.376
BILLS IN THE BILL KNOW THE BILL

01:46:23.443 --> 01:46:24.211
SAYS KNOWINGLY.

01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:26.913
SO KNOWINGLY OR NOT IS NOT THE

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:27.948
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY CONCERN YOU

01:46:28.014 --> 01:46:29.282
MIGHT KNOW BUT YOU HAD NO

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:31.685
CONTROL OVER GREAT.

01:46:31.752 --> 01:46:33.787
SO I I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TAKE OF

01:46:33.854 --> 01:46:35.489
THE CHINA PIECE AND THEN I'M

01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:37.557
GONNA LET OUR TOXICOLOGIST GO TO

WHAT WE WERE TOLD IF IT IN THE

01:46:52.239 --> 01:46:54.975
BEGINNING OF DOING THIS BILL BY

01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:57.210
THE OPPOSITION WAS ABSOLUTELY

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:58.545
POSITIVELY?

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:00.881
NO ONE CAN SELL THEIR PRODUCTS

01:47:00.947 --> 01:47:02.549
IN CHINA.

01:47:02.616 --> 01:47:04.651
WITHOUT TESTING ON ON PAIN THE

01:47:04.718 --> 01:47:06.853
CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO TEST THEIR

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:09.322
PRODUCT IN LESS.

01:47:09.389 --> 01:47:10.991
YOU HAD A MANUFACTURING PLANT IN

01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:12.092

WE SPOKE TOO MANY MANUFACTURERS

01:47:20.634 --> 01:47:22.736
THAT ARE CRUELTY FREE AND THE

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.571
ONE IN PARTICULAR IS JOHN PAUL

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:26.473
MITCHELL SYSTEMS.

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:29.142
THEY HAVE BEEN IN SANTA CLARITA

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:30.377
FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS THEY MAKE

01:47:30.443 --> 01:47:32.379
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:47:32.445 --> 01:47:34.047
AND THEY'VE BEEN CRUELTY FREE

01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:35.715
SINCE INCEPTION.

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.884

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.087
MARKET.

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:44.891
AND THE CHINESE REGULATORS SAY.

01:47:44.958 --> 01:47:46.927
WE HAVE TO TOUCH OUR PRODUCTS ON

01:47:46.993 --> 01:47:47.994
ANIMALS AND THEY SAID

01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:48.295
[inaudible]

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:57.704
REGULATORS A FINE ATTEST.

01:47:57.771 --> 01:48:00.073
THAT WAS AMICABLE TO BOTH SIDES

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:02.576
IT'S A SKIN TEST OUT OF BOSTON A

01:48:02.642 --> 01:48:05.846
COMPANY CALLED MATT TACK.

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:09.783
UP AND THEY USE THAT. TO START

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:11.084
PUTTING THEIR SKEWS THROUGH AND

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.652
TESTING.

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:14.387
SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:17.157
MODELS OF HOW YOU CAN BE IN

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:19.893
CHINA TODAY FORGET ABOUT THIS

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.661
BILL COMPLETELY.

01:48:21.728 --> 01:48:24.531
AND TEN DAYS BE IN CHINA WITHOUT

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:27.133
TESTING ON ANIMALS THE OTHER WAY

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.969
IS TO SET UP A STORE FRONT IN

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:30.070
SHANGHAI.

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:32.405
AND YOU'RE ALLOWED TO TO THEN.

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:35.308
PUT YOUR PRODUCTS INTO THE

01:48:35.375 --> 01:48:36.643
CHINESE MARKET FROM THERE.

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:39.679
A THIRD WAY WHICH IS I BELIEVE

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.848
IT WAS A MULTI TRILLION DOLLAR

01:48:41.915 --> 01:48:43.750
INDUSTRY AND I CAN SEND YOU THE

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:45.619

LARGEST ONLINE RETAILER IN THE

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:51.625
WORLD.

01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:55.562
SO THERE IS NO REASON TO NOT BE

01:48:55.629 --> 01:48:56.897
IN CHINA.

01:48:56.963 --> 01:48:59.799
NUMBER ONE YOU CAN BE IN CHINA

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:01.902
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE CRUEL

01:49:01.968 --> 01:49:03.970
TO BE THERE.

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:05.772
THE CHINESE ALL LET.

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:49.716
YOU THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS OR

01:54:49.782 --> 01:54:50.984
WERE ACTUALLY CREATING A

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.418
STANDARD THAT'S HIGHER THAN THAT

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:53.620
IF I COULD GET.

01:54:53.686 --> 01:54:55.488
BOTH THE OPPOSITION AND THE

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:57.490
PROPONENTS TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME

01:54:57.557 --> 01:55:03.263
IN THEIR OWN TERMS.

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:05.198
SO WHAT THINK THE EUROPEAN UNION

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.600
DEAD.

01:55:07.667 --> 01:55:09.936
NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WAS A SET

01:55:10.003 --> 01:55:14.107
UP A SYSTEM WHEREBY OVER TIME.

01:55:14.173 --> 01:55:15.608
THE CUT OF THEIR EUROPEAN UNION

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:17.477
COSMETICS MARKET WOULD BE.

01:55:17.543 --> 01:55:19.912
CREW MORE AND MORE CRUELTY FREE.

01:55:19.979 --> 01:55:21.681
AND SO THE FINAL LAW WHICH WAS

01:55:21.748 --> 01:55:24.817
IMPLEMENTED IN --

01:55:24.884 --> 01:55:27.687
TW THOUSAND THIRTEEN SAID THAT --

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.122
ANY INGREDIENTS OR COSMETICS HAD

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.356
BEEN TESTED ANYWHERE IN THE

01:55:30.423 --> 01:55:31.557
WORLD BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:55:31.624 --> 01:55:32.859
TELEMARKETING.

01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:34.961
BAND IN ORDER TO PREVENT TESTERS

01:55:35.028 --> 01:55:35.461
FROM JUST GOING TO OTHER

01:55:35.528 --> 01:55:37.130
COUNTRIES.

01:55:37.196 --> 01:55:37.630
COULD NOT BE SOLD IN THE

01:55:37.697 --> 01:55:39.198
EUROPEAN UNION.

01:55:39.265 --> 01:55:42.001
NOW THEY CREATED OVER THAT OVER

01:55:42.068 --> 01:55:43.469
TIME THE COURTS IN THROUGH

01:55:43.536 --> 01:55:45.138
IMPLEMENTATION OF CREATED TO

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:46.472
EXEMPTIONS ONE AS FOR

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:48.641
INTERNATIONAL TESTING WHICH IS

01:55:48.708 --> 01:55:49.208
WHAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:50.376
WHAT CHINA.

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:52.712
REQUESTING REQUIREMENTS AND ONE

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:54.747
IS FOR THEIR REACH LEGISLATION

01:55:54.814 --> 01:55:56.215
WHICH IS A CHEMICAL TESTING

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.518
LEGISLATION. FOR INDUSTRIAL

01:55:58.584 --> 01:56:00.887
CHEMICALS.

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:03.356
SO THOSE ARE THOSE OF A SANCTION.

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:05.958
ARBIL HOUSE EXEMPTIONS FOR

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:08.795
PRODUCTS TESTED BY THIRD PARTIES.

01:56:08.861 --> 01:56:10.229
UP FOR IT UNDER REGULATORY

01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:12.965
REQUIREMENT [inaudible]

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:15.001
SO THAT.

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:15.868
IS IT TAKES CARE OF SOME OF THAT

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:19.105
COMES --

01:56:19.172 --> 01:56:20.940
WHAT WE FIND WHAT WE HAVE FOUND

01:56:21.007 --> 01:56:23.176
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS IS THAT

01:56:23.242 --> 01:56:25.378
ALMOST ALL ANIMAL TESTING HER

01:56:25.445 --> 01:56:28.314
COSMETICS HAS NOW ENDED?

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:31.050
EXCEPT IS FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:32.352
IN --

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:34.954
CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND SO IF WE

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:36.422
WERE TO HAVE A BILL THAT DIDN'T

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:38.658
ADDRESS TESTING THAT HAPPENS IN

01:56:38.725 --> 01:56:40.993
CHINA.

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:43.463
IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE FACT.

01:56:43.529 --> 01:56:46.799
SO EVEN THAT YOU NOW THE

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:49.502
EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT HAS PASSED A

01:56:49.569 --> 01:56:50.703
RESOLUTION JUST A JUST LAST

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:52.372
MONTH.

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:53.973
CALLING FOR A GLOBAL BAN ON

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.110
ANIMALS HOUSE COSMETICS SEEMS

01:56:57.176 --> 01:56:59.011
THAT THE ORIGINAL YOU LAW FROM

01:56:59.078 --> 01:57:01.214
FIVE YEARS AGO DIDN'T GO FAR.

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.882
SO THAT IS A RESOLUTION THAT

01:57:02.949 --> 01:57:04.350
THEY PASSED LIKE A HOPEFUL

01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:07.587
RESOLUTION NOT ALONG QUICKLY BUT

01:57:07.653 --> 01:57:08.287
ALSO SAID HIS LAN.

01:57:08.354 --> 01:57:10.490
DOES GO FURTHER SO WHEN PEOPLE

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:12.392
ARE SAYING WE WANT WAY THE U.

01:57:12.458 --> 01:57:13.993
HAS.

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.862
THAT'S INCORRECT WE WANT WERE

01:57:15.928 --> 01:57:17.230
SEAT WHAT.

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:19.065
I'M HEARING PROPONENTS SAY HAS.

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:20.032
WE ACTUALLY ARE ASKING

01:57:20.099 --> 01:57:21.534
CALIFORNIA DO MORE THAN THAT YOU

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:23.202
TO IT.

01:57:23.269 --> 01:57:25.271
IS THAT CORRECT WERE WERE MOVING

01:57:25.338 --> 01:57:26.672
WERE MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD

01:57:26.739 --> 01:57:29.776
BUT WERE GIVEN THEM UNTIL TWENTY

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:30.176
TWENTY THREE SO.

01:57:30.243 --> 01:57:32.145
YES THERE'S THIS GAPING HOLE

01:57:32.211 --> 01:57:36.783
CALLED CHINA AND YOU KNOW THAT.

01:57:36.849 --> 01:57:39.419
IF HE CONTINUES FOR EVER THEN

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:41.154
NOTHING IS GETTING DONE THAT'S

01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:44.791
NEW SO THAT'S THE CUT OFF IS

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:45.992
TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THIS BILL

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:47.326
I AND I'M SORRY TO DO THIS

01:57:47.393 --> 01:57:47.794
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:49.962
DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE I IT

01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:53.065
TOOK THIS BILL TO UNDERSTAND --

01:57:53.132 --> 01:57:54.834
THAT MOST THE PRODUCTS I'M

01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:57.403
PURCHASE SCENE LA AND THEY'VE

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:58.871
BEEN TESTED ON ANIMALS THAT'S

01:57:58.938 --> 01:58:01.707
NOT TRUE BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD

01:58:01.774 --> 01:58:03.075
REFERENCE.

01:58:03.142 --> 01:58:05.344
FOR BONDIES MAKE UP BOTH I'M SO

01:58:05.411 --> 01:58:07.780
IT'S PROBABLY NOT TRUE HOWEVER

01:58:07.847 --> 01:58:10.082
THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:12.785
THE BECAUSE MAKES I'M PURCHASING

01:58:12.852 --> 01:58:13.986
HAVE BEEN TEST ON ANIMALS.

01:58:14.053 --> 01:58:15.655
THE IF THE IMPRESSION GIVEN TO

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:17.457
ME BY THE ADVOCATES IS --

01:58:17.523 --> 01:58:19.826
THAT THAT IS HAPPENING HERE.

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:21.794
SOMEWHERE RIGHT IN THAT WE'RE

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.296
TRYING TO PREVENT THAT WHICH I'M

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:24.330
ALL IN FAVOR.

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:24.997
I AM NOW HERE IN HERE AND I JUST

01:58:25.064 --> 01:58:27.633
WANT.

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:29.769
AND VOTING FOR THIS TODAY I JUST

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:31.437
I THINK THESE ISSUES HOW WE'RE

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:32.672
NOT GETTING IT OFF THE FLOOR THE

01:58:32.738 --> 01:58:33.539
ASSEMBLY WITHOUT THESE ISSUES

01:58:33.606 --> 01:58:34.841
BEING ADDRESSED.

01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:36.676
THAT'S MY FEELING RIGHT NOW.

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:38.377
AND IF YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT

01:58:38.444 --> 01:58:39.912
WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:40.980
IS MOVING THE NEEDLE

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.615
SPECIFICALLY ME UP MOVING THE

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:45.651
NEEDLE ON TESTING IN CHINA.

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:47.920
THAT'S A DIFFERENT.

01:58:47.987 --> 01:58:49.388
GOAL THAN I THOUGHT WE

01:58:49.455 --> 01:58:51.123
ORIGINALLY AT IS THAT THAT IS

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:52.525
THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION IS

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.060
NOT JUST.

01:58:54.126 --> 01:58:55.895
THAT WE DON'T TEST HERE BUT THAT

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:57.930
WE GET THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO

01:58:57.997 --> 01:58:59.699
CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES.

01:58:59.765 --> 01:59:02.969
IS THAT CORRECT.

01:59:03.035 --> 01:59:05.071
NO THAT THE THAT THE GOAL OF THE

01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:06.772
LEGISLATION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:08.541
WHEN CALIFORNIANS.

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:09.842
BUYING COSMETICS AND PERSONAL

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:10.843
CARE PRODUCTS IF THEY HAVE

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:11.477
CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE CRUELTY

01:59:11.544 --> 01:59:12.945
FREE.

01:59:13.012 --> 01:59:14.580
AND SO YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:15.481
KINDS OF TESTING YOU HAVE

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:17.116
TESTING.

01:59:17.183 --> 01:59:18.117
BECAUSE OF CHINESE OR OTHER

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:20.653
REQUIREMENTS --

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.088
OR YOU HAVE INGREDIENT

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:24.390
INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENT.

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:27.226
AND SO THAT THAT COULD BE

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:28.694
HAPPENING --

01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:29.829
FOR INGREDIENTS THAT GO INTO

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:31.631
COSMETICS HERE OR IN OTHER

01:59:31.697 --> 01:59:33.533
COUNTRIES.

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.568
I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE THING WIN

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:38.471
WE PASSED THIS LAW IN CALIFORNIA

01:59:38.538 --> 01:59:40.606
IT'S SAID THAT WE WANT TO END

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:43.543
THE ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETICS.

01:59:43.609 --> 01:59:45.645
BUT WHAT IT ALSO SAID IS WHERE

01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:47.513
THERE'S ALTERNATIVES.

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.315
THERE IS NOT ENFORCEMENT

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:51.450
MECHANISM ON THAT SO THERE

01:59:51.517 --> 01:59:54.487
REALLY IS NO GUARANTEE WE DON'T

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.055
KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THE LOOK

01:59:56.122 --> 01:59:58.691
INSIDE THESE LABS TO KNOW THAT

01:59:58.758 --> 02:00:00.693
THEY'RE USING ALTERNATIVES AND

02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:02.762
THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPORT.

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:06.432
SO THIS LIKE SHE SAYS IF ITS

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:08.301
CRUELTY FREE WE WANT TO KNOW ITS

02:00:08.367 --> 02:00:09.735
CRUELTY FREE.

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:11.971
AND THIS IS A WAY OF MOVING THAT

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.706
FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA FOR

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:17.209
CALIFORNIANS AND PUTTING SOME

02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:19.378
KIND OF DEADLINE ON THIS

02:00:19.445 --> 02:00:21.514
INTERNATIONAL [inaudible]

02:00:21.581 --> 02:00:24.216
KILLEEN TORTURING OTHER ANIMALS

02:00:24.283 --> 02:00:25.751
THAT THEN [inaudible]

02:00:25.818 --> 02:00:27.553
TEENS.

02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:29.755
EVERYBODY'S MAKEUP ES DE LAWEDRE

02:00:29.822 --> 02:00:31.490
SAYS ON THEIR WEBSITE CRUELTY

02:00:31.557 --> 02:00:33.726
FREE BELOW IT'S NOT.

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.127
IF THEY'RE TESTING OVER IN CHINA

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:37.330
ON THE ANIMALS WHAT DIFFERENCE

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:38.731
DOES IT MAKE IF THEY'RE TESTING

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:39.565
AND CHINA ARE THEIR TESTING

02:00:39.632 --> 02:00:41.167
CALIFORNIA THEIR TESTING ON

02:00:41.233 --> 02:00:42.268
ANIMALS.

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:43.970
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY ITS

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:45.738
CRUELTY FURRY.

02:00:45.805 --> 02:00:47.239
SO WHAT WE'RE BUYING IS WERE

02:00:47.306 --> 02:00:48.674
BUYING WHAT THEY WANT US TO

02:00:48.741 --> 02:00:51.777
BELIEVE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:53.779
SO SO I'M JUST GONNA POST THIS

02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:54.981
IS A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION I

02:00:55.047 --> 02:00:56.082
DON'T NEED AN ANSWER TO THIS BUT

02:00:56.148 --> 02:00:57.450
I THINK IT'S VERY REALISTIC FOR

02:00:57.516 --> 02:00:58.551
SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO IS VERY

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:00.319
CONCERNED ABOUT PRODUCTS MADE IN

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:01.454
CHINA.

02:01:01.520 --> 02:01:03.155
NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LABOR.

02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:05.391
CONDITIONS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:06.892
RULES THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWED IN

02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:09.028
CHINA I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:11.597
THE RULES THAT WE ASSUME ABOUT

02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:13.099
PRODUCTS IN GENERAL.

02:01:13.165 --> 02:01:14.567
THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO MOVE

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:17.269
COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS WHO STILL

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:19.171
EXIST IN THE UNITED STATES TO

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:21.007
CHINA I WOULD MUCH RATHER --

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:22.241
AND FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE

02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:24.777
WITH AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS THAT

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.679
I WOULD ON ANY CHINESE ME

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:28.748
PRODUCT I MEAN I'M I'M.

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:31.550
YOU KNOW SO BUT THEN WE MUST

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:33.119
WEEK WE MUST ASK OURSELVES IF

02:01:33.185 --> 02:01:35.054
CHINA IS UNWILLING TO CHANGE THE

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:37.823
ROLES ARE WE IN FACT PUSHING

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:40.092
THESE MANUFACTURERS. TO CHINA SO

02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:42.895
THAT THEY CAN AVOID THE TESTING

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:43.963
OF ANIMAL TESTING THAT'S

02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:45.665
REQUIRED MY UNDERSTANDING IS IN

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:47.400
CHINA ONLY IF THINGS MADE.

02:01:47.466 --> 02:01:49.101
OUTSIDE OF CHINA IF GOD I DON'T

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:55.394

HI AMANDA WILCOX HERE ON BEHALF

02:14:03.368 --> 02:14:05.070
OF CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE

02:14:05.137 --> 02:14:06.405

02:14:07.539 --> 02:14:09.274
I WILL LIMIT MY REMARKS TO THE

02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:11.243
FISCAL ISSUE --

02:14:11.309 --> 02:14:12.077
ONE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE

02:14:12.144 --> 02:14:14.012
BILL IS TO WEIGH THE FILING AND

02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:16.047
SERVICE FEE FOR THOSE SEEKING A

02:14:16.114 --> 02:14:18.383
COMBINES RESTRAINING ORDER THIS

02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:20.585
WAIVER IS SIMILAR TO THE FEE

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:22.554
WAIVERS THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS.

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:23.021
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

02:14:23.088 --> 02:14:25.424
RESTRAINING ORDERS AND I THINK

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:26.958
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE DON'T

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:28.794
WANT THIS LEGAL TOOL TO DISARM

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:31.229
SOMEONE DANGEROUS ONLY AVAILABLE

OUGHT TO PETITION FOR THE ORDER --

02:14:34.933 --> 02:14:36.701
BUT I ALSO ADD THAT THE ORDER

02:14:36.768 --> 02:14:39.304
HAS NOT BEEN USED MUCH.

02:14:39.371 --> 02:14:41.506
A IN PART BECAUSE THE LAW WHEN

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:43.175
ENACTED STATED THAT THIS SHOULD

02:14:43.241 --> 02:14:44.543
BE A LAST RESORT IF THERE'S

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:45.877
ANOTHER WAY TO REMOVE THE

02:14:45.944 --> 02:14:46.912

02:14:46.978 --> 02:14:48.780
THAT SHOULD BE USED FIRST --

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.515
AND WE'RE FINDING THAT PRIMARILY

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.384
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS USING THIS

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:53.852
TOOL AND OF COURSE THEY'RE NOT

02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:55.787
GONNA CHARGE THEMSELVES A FEE

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:27.098
ORGANIZATION.

02:28:27.164 --> 02:28:28.199
BUT RATHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:29.367
JUDGE SEEING THIS THROUGH THE

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:31.535
PRISM OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A

SIERRA SERVICE FOR YEARS TO COME.

02:28:36.907 --> 02:28:38.009
I FEEL PRIVILEGED HAVE BEEN

APPOINTED JUST LAST YEAR AND I

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:40.845
SINCERELY HOPE THAT I HAVE THE

HAPPEN AND SOMETIMES IT JUST

02:28:47.218 --> 02:28:48.653
DOESN'T WORK THE WAY WE PLAN AND

02:28:48.719 --> 02:28:51.088
THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT REALITY --

02:28:51.155 --> 02:28:53.190
CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE JUDGE STEVE

02:28:53.257 --> 02:28:54.825
PARK FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO WAS

02:28:54.892 --> 02:28:56.127

DOCTORS GAVE HIM FOUR TO SIX

02:29:01.299 --> 02:29:02.366
MONTHS TO LIVE UNFORTUNATELY

02:29:02.433 --> 02:29:04.335
THEY WERE WRONG BUT AT THE TIME

02:29:04.402 --> 02:29:06.304
HE KNEW HE HAD TO SURVIVE TO THE

02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:07.738
AGE OF SIXTY FIVE TO GET A

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.840
DEFINED BENEFIT FOR HIS WIFE.

02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:11.242
A DISABILITY RETIREMENT WAS

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:12.443

DEFINED BENEFIT PAYOUT HE HAD

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:15.479
BEEN COUNTING ON FOR HIS

02:29:15.546 --> 02:29:17.181

AS IT WAS HE WISE IT S. B. SIX

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:20.785

ASSURING HIS WIFE OF FINANCIAL

02:29:24.922 --> 02:29:26.123

YEAR IN EL HEALTH AFTER HIS

02:29:29.593 --> 02:29:30.394
TWENTY YEAR ANNIVERSARY IS A

02:29:30.461 --> 02:29:31.562
JUDGE JUST TO AVOID LEAVING

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:32.863
HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WITH LESS

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:34.231
THAN HALF OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT

02:29:34.298 --> 02:29:36.033
THEY WERE COUNTING ON THIS IS

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:37.735
NOT THE ONLY JUDGE WHO SUFFERED

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:38.202
FROM THIS.

02:29:38.269 --> 02:29:39.270
TYPE OF EXPERIENCE AND IT COULD

02:29:39.337 --> 02:29:42.239

THIS AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS

02:29:58.389 --> 02:29:59.757
