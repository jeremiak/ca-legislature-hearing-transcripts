SINCE THEN.

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:03.602 region:rollup2
IT FOCUSES ON INCREASING TREE

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.671 region:rollup2
CANOPY.

00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:06.705 region:rollup2

CLEANING THE AIR AND STORING

00:30:24.356 --> 00:30:27.726 region:rollup2
CARBON THIS PROGRAM HAS REALLY

00:30:26.525 --> 00:30:29.227 region:rollup2
SHOWN ITSELF TO MAKE A REAL

00:30:27.726 --> 00:30:30.362 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:32.197 region:rollup2
LIFE OF DISADVANTAGED

00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:33.899 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:36.034 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALMOST

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:38.437 region:rollup2
WITHOUT FAIL ALSO HAVE THE

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:41.039 region:rollup2
LOWEST TREE CANOPY COVER.

00:30:38.437 --> 00:30:42.507 region:rollup2
AND THIS CAN THE CLEARLY SHOWN

00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:44.476 region:rollup2
ON MAPS SHOWING A RELATIONSHIP

00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:46.278 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:48.580 region:rollup2
TREE CANOPY AND DISADVANTAGED

00:30:46.278 --> 00:30:50.082 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.717 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN

00:30:50.082 --> 00:30:53.452 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE

00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:54.920 region:rollup2
WHICH IMPACTS THE MOST

00:30:53.452 --> 00:30:57.456 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE. NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.224 region:rollup2
STATE.

00:30:57.456 --> 00:31:01.793 region:rollup2
WITH PARKING LOTS STREETS AND

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:03.729 region:rollup2
PARKS THAT ARE SHADED BY TREES

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:05.664 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO.

00:31:03.729 --> 00:31:06.264 region:rollup2
WALK INSTEAD OF DRIVE AND SPEND

00:31:05.664 --> 00:31:08.934 region:rollup2
TIME OUTDOORS WITH FAMILY AND

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:11.069 region:rollup2
FRIENDS.

00:31:08.934 --> 00:31:13.138 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:15.040 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS.

00:31:13.138 --> 00:31:16.675 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.177 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF.

00:31:16.675 --> 00:31:21.446 region:rollup2
URBAN TREES SUCH AS SIR ENERGY

00:31:19.177 --> 00:31:23.882 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION.

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:25.183 region:rollup2
THEY IMPROVE AIR QUALITY.

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:27.419 region:rollup2
THEY INCREASED COMMERCIAL

00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:29.788 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS.

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:31.823 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE.

00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:34.226 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HELPED AND THEY GENERALLY

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:35.694 region:rollup2
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:37.129 region:rollup2
SO THE BOTTOM LINE TAKE HOME

00:31:35.694 --> 00:31:39.398 region:rollup2
MESSAGE IS THAT TREES IN URBAN

00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:41.032 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:31:39.398 --> 00:31:42.834 region:rollup2
THIS STORE CARBON DAY REDUCE

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:44.536 region:rollup2
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:45.737 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE A REAL TANGIBLE

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:47.472 region:rollup2
POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:49.408 region:rollup2
LIVES.

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:51.042 region:rollup2
AND THIS POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IS

00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:54.346 region:rollup2
MOST PRONOUNCED IN DISADVANTAGED

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:55.981 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:31:54.346 --> 00:31:58.183 region:rollup2
SO OUR PROGRAM PROVIDES

00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:59.484 region:rollup2

URBAN WOOD UTILIZATION AND

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:24.209 region:rollup2
FORCED MANAGEMENT PLANS.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.611 region:rollup2
IN TOTAL CAL FIRES

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:28.613 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:30.348 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON THE GROUNDS TOTALING.

00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:32.551 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE POINT

00:32:30.348 --> 00:32:33.385 region:rollup2
ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO DATE IN

CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENT

00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:39.057 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:41.459 region:rollup2
AND THE THERE'S CLEARLY STILL A

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:43.428 region:rollup2
NEED.

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:44.996 region:rollup2
A RECENT DATA INDICATE THAT

00:32:43.428 --> 00:32:47.332 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S URBAN AREAS HAVE

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:48.066 region:rollup2
ONLY FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE LAND

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:50.168 region:rollup2
AREA COVERED IN THREE COUNT UP

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:51.903 region:rollup2
THE ON THE AVERAGE.

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:54.739 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS.

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:56.541 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AMONG THE LOWEST OF OF

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:58.643 region:rollup2
ALL STATES IN THE NATION.

00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:00.145 region:rollup2
SO CLEARLY THERE ARE AND

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:02.013 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES TO PLANT

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:06.318 region:rollup2
MILLIONS MORE URBAN PIECING

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:09.654 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S URBAN AREAS.

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:10.288 region:rollup2
AND THE URBAN FORESTS ARE.

00:33:09.654 --> 00:33:12.324 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PART OF THE

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:14.392 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE OF URBAN AREAS

00:33:12.324 --> 00:33:15.594 region:rollup2
DID PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:18.330 region:rollup2
SAYS WALLACE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL

00:33:15.594 --> 00:33:19.865 region:rollup2
CALL BENEFITS.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.867 region:rollup2
SO AS OPPOSED TO OTHER

00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:24.202 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENTS ALL OF

00:33:21.867 --> 00:33:25.971 region:rollup2
WHICH DEPRECIATING VALUES.

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:28.106 region:rollup2
TREES ACTUALLY APPRECIATE IN

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:30.709 region:rollup2
VALUE US TO GET LARGER AND OLDER

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:32.844 region:rollup2
THEY BECOME MORE VALUABLE.

00:33:30.709 --> 00:33:34.112 region:rollup2
SO A AND DEMANDING TIME I WOULD

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:36.314 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:37.716 region:rollup2
NOTABLE PROJECTS ACROSS THE

00:45:24.055 --> 00:45:25.990 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY ABOUT THIS

00:45:25.456 --> 00:45:27.291 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THE IMPACTS ON THE

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.659 region:rollup2
VALUE.

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.927 region:rollup2
I'M MARY CHRISTMANN I'M WITH THE

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:31.529 region:rollup2
TRUST FOR PUBLIC.

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:33.064 region:rollup2
WE ARE A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION

00:45:31.529 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
THAT'S WORKING TO CREATE HEALTHY

00:45:33.064 --> 00:45:36.867 region:rollup2
CLIMATE SMART COMMUNITIES WITH

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.369 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO MAJOR FOR ALL AND

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:40.071 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN DOING IMPLEMENTATION

00:45:38.369 --> 00:45:42.440 region:rollup2
URBAN DRAINING PROJECTS FOR OVER

00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:44.475 region:rollup2
FORTY FIVE YEARS THAT ACTUALLY.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.310 region:rollup2
ARE FOUNDATION OUR HISTORY WHAT

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:47.378 region:rollup2
OUR WORK IS REALLY BUILT ON I'M

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.413 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE THRILLED ABOUT THIS

00:45:47.378 --> 00:45:50.848 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I'M AND REALLY EXCITED

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:52.416 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

00:45:50.848 --> 00:45:53.951 region:rollup2
VALUE IN THE NEED FOR THE WORK.

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.885 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE PART THE

00:45:53.951 --> 00:45:56.821 region:rollup2
REASON THIS PROGRAM IS SO

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:58.623 region:rollup2
VALUABLE IS USE OUR CURRENT

00:45:56.821 --> 00:45:59.724 region:rollup2
URBAN DESIGN IS HURTING US IT'S

00:45:58.623 --> 00:46:01.392 region:rollup2
HURTING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS?

00:45:59.724 --> 00:46:02.860 region:rollup2
WE HAVE GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:46:01.392 --> 00:46:04.462 region:rollup2
INCREASES CLIMATE IMPACTS

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.530 region:rollup2
INCREASES HEAT INCREASES

00:46:04.462 --> 00:46:07.999 region:rollup2
POLLUTION AND AARON WATER ON IT

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:09.267 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY HURTING US AND HAS

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:11.269 region:rollup2
FETAL IMPACTS.

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:13.237 region:rollup2
THAT'S AREALITY THIS IS A

00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:15.172 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT IS CATALYZING AN

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:16.707 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITIES TO

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:17.341 region:rollup2
RE ENVISION THE ROLE OF

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:18.943 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR

00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:20.011 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:21.312 region:rollup2
RE ENVISION THE ROLE OF

00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:23.447 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE AYE TO

00:46:21.312 --> 00:46:25.449 region:rollup2
PROVIDE HEALTHY CONNECTED AND

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:27.151 region:rollup2
CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:28.519 region:rollup2
THIS IS UNIQUE WE DON'T HAVE A

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:30.554 region:rollup2
LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DO

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:32.690 region:rollup2
THIS. IN ADDITION I WOULD REALLY

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:34.292 region:rollup2
SAY THAT THIS PROGRAM MARY'S AND

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.993 region:rollup2
MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION IN A

00:46:34.292 --> 00:46:37.995 region:rollup2
SPECIAL WAY BUT THROUGH THE

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:40.031 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS NOT ONLY DO WE GET

00:46:37.995 --> 00:46:42.833 region:rollup2
LOW CARBON COMMUNITIES BUT WE

00:46:40.031 --> 00:46:44.001 region:rollup2
ALSO GET ADAPTED COMMUNITIES.

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:45.903 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ABLE TO WEATHER SUITS

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:47.405 region:rollup2
STREAM WEATHER EVENTS ON AN

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:48.606 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WAY I'M AND WERE

00:46:47.405 --> 00:46:49.907 region:rollup2
ALREADY SEEING THOSE.

00:46:48.606 --> 00:46:51.208 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT READY FOR CLIMATE

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.610 region:rollup2
CHANGE

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:54.545 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE WITH

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:56.781 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK I CONSTITUENTS IN

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:58.382 region:rollup2
YOUR DISTRICTS WOULD REALLY FEEL

00:46:56.781 --> 00:46:59.316 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS AND ARTICULATE

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:01.185 region:rollup2
FEELING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.919 region:rollup2
CHANGE. AND A SEVERE WAY RIGHT

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:03.220 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:47:01.919 --> 00:47:04.555 region:rollup2
WE ARE READY AND WE DON'T HAVE

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.590 region:rollup2
POTS OF MONEY THAT ARE

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:08.159 region:rollup2
INTEGRATING AYE CHANGING IN

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.793 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:10.795 region:rollup2
FOR HEALTHY CONNECTED

00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:12.196 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND THIS IS ONE THAT

00:47:10.795 --> 00:47:14.532 region:rollup2
IS JUST GOTTEN STARTED WITH ONE

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:15.700 region:rollup2
FIRST ROUND. OF INVESTMENTS AND

00:47:14.532 --> 00:47:17.435 region:rollup2
I THINK THE POTENTIAL IS

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.236 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT I WANT TO JUST SAY

00:47:17.435 --> 00:47:21.038 region:rollup2
COUPLE STATS IN TERMS OF JUST

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:22.840 region:rollup2
THE PURE GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:24.642 region:rollup2
OF THIS PROGRAM. I'M FIRST A

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:26.010 region:rollup2
STUDY BY BERKELEY CITED THAT IF

00:47:24.642 --> 00:47:27.278 region:rollup2
WE WERE TO DO A COOL COMMUNITY

00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.946 region:rollup2
STRATEGY USING GREEN

00:47:27.278 --> 00:47:30.314 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS I'M

00:47:28.946 --> 00:47:31.716 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE THERE'S THE

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:34.051 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY AT MINIMUM. TO

00:47:31.716 --> 00:47:36.153 region:rollup2
REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY FOUR

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:37.455 region:rollup2
MILLION TIMES ANNUALLY WE ALSO

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:39.590 region:rollup2
HAVE A STUDY LOOKING AT THE BAY

00:47:37.455 --> 00:47:41.425 region:rollup2
AREA THAT IF WE WERE TO SHIFT

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:42.693 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION MODES TO ACTIVE

00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:44.962 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION THAT FIFTY

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:45.896 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ALL SHORT OR MEDIUM

00:47:44.962 --> 00:47:48.265 region:rollup2
INCOME TRIPS.

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:50.167 region:rollup2
ARMS OF ONE TO FIVE MILES AYE

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:51.769 region:rollup2
INTO ACTIVE TRANSORTATION WOULD

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:54.071 region:rollup2
REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS BY

00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:55.139 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. AND

00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:56.941 region:rollup2
REDUCE DIABETES AND

00:47:55.139 --> 00:47:58.843 region:rollup2
CARDIOVASCULAR OF VASCULAR

00:47:56.941 --> 00:48:00.077 region:rollup2
DISEASE BY FOURTEEN PERCENT.

00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:01.779 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE AN ANALYSIS FROM

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:03.414 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF LA WHERE THEY'VE

00:48:01.779 --> 00:48:04.315 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT. LARGE SCALE

00:48:03.414 --> 00:48:05.549 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:07.318 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TO GREEN

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:09.286 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:48:07.318 --> 00:48:10.855 region:rollup2
THEM TO THEN LOCALLY SOURCED

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:12.289 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT OF

00:48:10.855 --> 00:48:13.791 region:rollup2
THEIR WATER.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.326 region:rollup2
THESE ARE REAL IMPACT ON THESE

00:48:13.791 --> 00:48:16.694 region:rollup2
ARE MULTIPLE BENEFIT IN THIS

00:48:15.326 --> 00:48:18.329 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EVEN SPEAK TO THE

00:48:16.694 --> 00:48:21.265 region:rollup2
REALITY OF CLEAN AIR

00:48:18.329 --> 00:48:23.100 region:rollup2
CLEANER WATER. MORE RECREATION

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:24.435 region:rollup2
I'M HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES ALL

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.637 region:rollup2
THE THINGS WE KNOW WE NEED IN

00:48:24.435 --> 00:48:27.938 region:rollup2
TERMS OF AYE DAY INCREASED

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:29.874 region:rollup2
IMPACTS WERE SAYING FROM FLOOD

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:32.009 region:rollup2
TO WILDFIRE. AYE TO SEA LEVEL

00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:32.543 region:rollup2
RISE AND I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:34.211 region:rollup2
WITH A COUPLE QUICK POINTS

00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:35.346 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.647 region:rollup2
STATE PROGRAMS HAVE THE

00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:38.783 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE THAN JUST

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:40.584 region:rollup2
FIND IMPORTANT PRICE.

00:48:38.783 --> 00:48:42.987 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:44.755 region:rollup2
BUT THE WAY WE STRATEGIZING CREE

00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:46.157 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE PROJECTS LIKE THIS.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:47.825 region:rollup2
CATALYZES INNOVATION AT THE

00:48:46.157 --> 00:48:50.227 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL ISN'T JUST ABOUT

00:48:47.825 --> 00:48:51.729 region:rollup2
FINDING THIS IS ABOUT SPURRING

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:54.865 region:rollup2
INTERNALIZING INNOVATION

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:56.867 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED AND ACROSS FUNCTIONAL

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:57.968 region:rollup2
I INVESTMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:00.604 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROGRAM HAD

00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:02.306 region:rollup2
DONE. IT INTEGRATED PLANNING.

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:03.874 region:rollup2
I'M IN A NEW WAY FOR A LOT OF

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.142 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THE OTHER THING I

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.544 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY IS THAT THIS IS ONE OF

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:08.446 region:rollup2
THE ONLY PROGRAMS FROM CAP AND

00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:09.613 region:rollup2
TRADE. THAT GOES TO WORK IN A

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:11.549 region:rollup2
REALLY VISIBLE WAY IN

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:13.617 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SO COMMUNITIES CAN

00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:14.418 region:rollup2
SEE THE IMPACT OF WHAT IT LOOKS

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:15.786 region:rollup2
LIKE TO CREATE LOW CARBON

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:17.087 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES FROM THE REVENUE OF

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:18.456 region:rollup2
CAP TRADE.

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:20.457 region:rollup2
THEY CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET

00:49:18.456 --> 00:49:21.459 region:rollup2
INVISIBLY SEE CHANGES.

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:22.993 region:rollup2
ANOTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS A

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.495 region:rollup2
NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WE ARE

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:25.963 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH STATES ALL OVER THE

00:49:24.495 --> 00:49:27.364 region:rollup2
COUNTRY WERE LOOKING AT CURRENT

00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.732 region:rollup2
PRICING PROGRAMS.

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:29.633 region:rollup2
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:31.202 region:rollup2
THEY CREATE THEIR OWN CLAIM A

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:32.703 region:rollup2
PROBLEM POP UP POLICIES WE'RE

00:49:31.202 --> 00:49:34.772 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE BIG BY

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:36.607 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REVENUES GENERATED

00:49:34.772 --> 00:49:38.075 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. IN TRYING TO

00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEIR INVESTMENT

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:41.245 region:rollup2
STRATEGY SHOULD BE AS ARE

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:42.580 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT CLIMATE POLICIES ON

00:49:41.245 --> 00:49:43.347 region:rollup2
THIS HAVE TO BE PART OF THE

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.248 region:rollup2
BLUEPRINTS.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:45.683 region:rollup2
WE ARE WORKING WITH THE STATE OF

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:47.251 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON WHO'S REALLY LOOKING

00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:49.220 region:rollup2
AT EVERY PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:51.222 region:rollup2
POLICY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THEY

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.123 region:rollup2
SHOULD DO IT. AND IF WE DO NOT

00:49:51.222 --> 00:49:54.291 region:rollup2
INCLUDE CRITICAL STRATEGIES LIKE

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:55.693 region:rollup2
GREEN MULTIPLE BENEFIT GREEN

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:57.328 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND URBAN

00:49:55.693 --> 00:49:59.330 region:rollup2
GREENING THAT MEANS THAT ACROSS

00:49:57.328 --> 00:50:00.865 region:rollup2
THE WORLD WERE JURISDICTIONS ARE

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.166 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT US FOR A MODEL.

00:50:00.865 --> 00:50:03.567 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE MISSING THAT

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.368 region:rollup2
CRITICAL ESSENTIAL PIECE OF THE

00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:06.203 region:rollup2
PUZZLE

00:50:04.368 --> 00:50:07.771 region:rollup2
IN CREATING LOW CARB BANG

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:08.772 region:rollup2
HEALTHY RESILIENT COMMUNITIES

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:10.274 region:rollup2
ANSWERED THANK YOU FOR THE

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:11.242 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE I'M WE

00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:12.543 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR TO

00:50:11.242 --> 00:50:13.644 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE.

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:18.949 region:rollup2
I'M MAKING SURE THIS WORK

00:50:13.644 --> 00:50:21.585 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE FUNDED.

00:50:18.949 --> 00:50:24.388 region:rollup2
GOING WITHOUT.

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:26.490 region:rollup2
AND COVER UPS ARE GONNA COVER

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:26.657 region:rollup2
THREE ASPECTS OF THE.

A FIRST A TO TALK ABOUT RELEASE

00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:33.130 region:rollup2
ROLE IN URBAN FORESTRY AND THEN

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:34.732 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT ARE

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.500 region:rollup2
GRANTING PROGRAMS ON A COUPLE OF

00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:37.134 region:rollup2
PROJECTS. UNLESS I'M GOING TO

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.537 region:rollup2

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.018 region:rollup2
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE TREES WE

00:52:33.317 --> 00:52:35.285 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A DOUBLE

00:52:34.018 --> 00:52:35.552 region:rollup2

URBAN FORCE PROJECTS ARE

00:58:07.484 --> 00:58:11.054 region:rollup2

00:58:28.672 --> 00:58:31.008 region:rollup2
MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN WHEN WE

THE GENERAL PLAN. AND MORE

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:53.576 region:rollup2
RECENTLY IN OUR. QUEST TO GET

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:55.545 region:rollup2
THIS LEGISLATION US LIKE PARK

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:57.113 region:rollup2
BOND ON THE BALLOT WE HAD OUR

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.747 region:rollup2
ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION OUT A

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:58.047 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PARK.

01:06:57.747 --> 01:07:00.083 region:rollup2
AND GOT TO.

01:06:58.047 --> 01:07:01.751 region:rollup2
.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:02.719 region:rollup2
HERE AND LEARN ABOUT THE PROJECT

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.921 region:rollup2
THAT YOU JUST HIGHLIGHTED SO

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:06.456 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR UP.

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:08.091 region:rollup2
CAN READ REAFFIRMING HOME

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:10.894 region:rollup2
PORTENT VALUABLE IT IS THAT WE

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:12.362 region:rollup2
GET OUT. OF THE CAPITAL AND DOES

01:07:10.894 --> 01:07:14.530 region:rollup2
YOU TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THE STATE

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.665 region:rollup2
TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.200 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES TO THE INVESTMENT

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:18.101 region:rollup2
SAID THAT WE'RE MAKING. AND THEY

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.401 region:rollup2
WERE ASKING TO BE MADE IN THE

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:20.169 region:rollup2
LONG TERM SO

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:22.939 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:07:20.169 --> 01:07:24.774 region:rollup2
OUR NEXT SPEAKER.

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:26.242 region:rollup2
I GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DEBORAH ONE

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:28.611 region:rollup2
SCENE BLOOM I'M THE SENIOR

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:30.313 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND RESEARCH

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:31.881 region:rollup2
AT TREAT PEOPLE. IN CASE YOU'RE

01:07:30.313 --> 01:07:33.816 region:rollup2
NOT FAMILIAR WHICH HE PEOPLE WE

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:35.685 region:rollup2
ARE AN ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:37.720 region:rollup2
LOCATE IN LOS ANGELES. WE HAVE

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:40.723 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING ON URBAN FORESTRY

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.492 region:rollup2
AND WATER POLICY ISSUES FOR OVER

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:44.127 region:rollup2
FOUR DECADES NO. THANKS FOR

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:46.129 region:rollup2
HAVING ME HERE.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:47.497 region:rollup2
SO TO THE POINT AT HAND JUST BY

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:49.332 region:rollup2
THE ACTUAL PRESENCE OF THIS

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:51.034 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE IT'S

01:07:49.332 --> 01:07:52.936 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT YOU'RE CLEAR THAT

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:54.637 region:rollup2
WE'RE FACING EXTREME INTENSE

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:56.105 region:rollup2
CLIMATE IMPACTS SOONER THAN WE

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:57.740 region:rollup2
EXPECTED.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:59.542 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T HOW TIME TO WASTE.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.644 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S GOOD NEWS

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:03.279 region:rollup2
TO GET THESE ANSWERS WE DO NOT

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.781 region:rollup2
HAVE TO RECREATE THE WHEEL.

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:06.749 region:rollup2
TREE PEOPLE HAS SPENT YEARS

01:08:04.781 --> 01:08:07.684 region:rollup2
STUDYING HOW AUSTRALIA HAS GONE

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:09.586 region:rollup2
THROUGH SEVERAL OF ITS

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:11.521 region:rollup2
EMERGENCIES SPECIFICALLY RELATED

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:12.822 region:rollup2
TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:14.223 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE HOW THEY SURVIVE

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:16.092 region:rollup2
THEIR DEVASTATING TWELVE YEAR

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:17.093 region:rollup2
MILLENNIUM DROUGHT AND HOW

01:08:16.092 --> 01:08:20.697 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THEIR

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:22.732 region:rollup2
CURRENT INCREASED HEAT PERIODS.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:23.666 region:rollup2
WE FOCUS ON AUSTRALIA BECAUSE

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.401 region:rollup2
OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE QUITE

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.736 region:rollup2
SIMILAR IN ADDITION TO YOU

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.571 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY OUR LIFESTYLE AND OUR

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:30.473 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE. THE CITY IN MELBOURNE

01:08:28.571 --> 01:08:32.008 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE HAS ABOUT FOUR

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:33.843 region:rollup2
MILLION PEOPLE THE SAME AMOUNT

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:35.511 region:rollup2
AS THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN IS

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.979 region:rollup2
FACING THE SAME CLIMATE

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:38.014 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AS WE ARE.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:39.549 region:rollup2
DROUGHT

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:41.351 region:rollup2
THE FLIPSIDE OF DROUGHT FLOODING

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:43.019 region:rollup2
AND INTENSE HEAT

01:08:41.351 --> 01:08:43.987 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THE CITY OF ADELAIDE

01:08:43.019 --> 01:08:46.356 region:rollup2
HAS THE SCHEMES.

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:49.459 region:rollup2
MEDITERRANEAN TYPE OF CLIMATE

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:51.327 region:rollup2
THAT MUCH OF CALIFORNIA HOUSE.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:53.830 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:56.099 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD ADOPT AND THEN ADAPT

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:58.067 region:rollup2
LESSONS FROM AUSTRALIA TO OUR

01:08:56.099 --> 01:08:59.002 region:rollup2
CURRENT SITUATION.

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:00.503 region:rollup2
REGARDING URBAN FORESTRY IN

01:08:59.002 --> 01:09:02.438 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR.

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:04.440 region:rollup2
WELL AUSTRALIA PROACTIVELY

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:05.942 region:rollup2
DEPLOYED EMERGENCY TACTICS

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:08.277 region:rollup2
DURING THEIR DROUGHT TO SEE

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:10.313 region:rollup2
THEIR LARGE HERITAGE TREES VAST

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:11.948 region:rollup2
AREAS OF LAND ENTRIES DIED

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.549 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE.

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:15.918 region:rollup2
IN THIS IS BECAUSE DURING THE

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:17.720 region:rollup2
DROUGHT THE ROLLING MONTHS LEFT

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:19.088 region:rollup2
AT ONE POINT OF WATER IN WHAT

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:21.124 region:rollup2
THEY CALLED THEIR CATCHMENT BUT

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:25.695 region:rollup2
WE COLOR WATERSHED. SO NO

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:27.497 region:rollup2
IRRIGATION WAS ALLOWED.

01:09:25.695 --> 01:09:28.698 region:rollup2
WHEN NEED SAT BACK AND FINALLY

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.900 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.602 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAPPENED.

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.570 region:rollup2
THEY REALIZE THE HUGE NEGATIVE

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:37.206 region:rollup2
IMPACTS THIS HOT ON THE ON THE

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:39.409 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:41.310 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY. IN FACT BASED ON

01:09:39.409 --> 01:09:43.212 region:rollup2
THAT WITHOUT THE ECOSYSTEM

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:45.381 region:rollup2
SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH THE

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:47.517 region:rollup2
SHADE AND EVAPORATIVE COOLING OF

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:49.652 region:rollup2
LEAFY TREE CANOPIES THE URBAN

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:51.287 region:rollup2
HEAT ISLAND INTENSIFIED AND IN

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:52.789 region:rollup2
FACT BECAME LETHAL.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:54.991 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE IN JANUARY TWO

01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:57.860 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINE MELVIN EXPERIENCED

01:09:54.991 --> 01:09:59.729 region:rollup2
IF SIXTY TWO PERCENT INCREASE IN

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.632 region:rollup2
HEAT RELATED MORTALITY PROMPTING

01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:04.400 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE CITY TO RETHINK OUR

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:05.868 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT. AYE THAT WERE

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:08.104 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED ITS DOUBT RICK

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:09.238 region:rollup2
DROUGHT RESTRICTIONS.

01:10:08.104 --> 01:10:11.574 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE NOW THEN

01:10:09.238 --> 01:10:13.910 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY IS SEVENTY DEGREES

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:15.845 region:rollup2
FAHRENHEIT NOT. DISSIMILAR TO

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:18.581 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR CITIES HERE. DURING

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:19.649 region:rollup2
THIS EXTREME HEAT EVENT IT WAS.

01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.984 region:rollup2
THE TEMPERATURES WERE EXCEEDING

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:23.653 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED AND NINE DEGREES FOR

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:25.021 region:rollup2
THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:26.689 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCHERS

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:28.624 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO SAVE

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:30.259 region:rollup2
LIVES LIVES IN TIMES OF EXTREME

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:32.628 region:rollup2
HEAT. WAS TO ENSURE THAT

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:34.630 region:rollup2
EVERYONE LIVED IN A COMMUNITY

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:36.566 region:rollup2
WITH DENSE TREE CANOPY.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:38.634 region:rollup2
I IF YOU LOOK AT THE HANDOUTS

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:40.503 region:rollup2
THAT I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:42.405 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO YOU BY KATIE. ONE OF

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:44.941 region:rollup2
THEM LOOKS LIKE THIS.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:46.242 region:rollup2
I. THE CITY MELTING CAME UP WITH

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:48.344 region:rollup2
A STRATEGY OF FOUR PRONG

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:50.646 region:rollup2
STRATEGY FIRST TO DOUBLE THEIR

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:51.714 region:rollup2
TREE CANOPY COVER THIS WAS FROM

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.549 region:rollup2
THERE TWENTY PERCENT TO FORTY

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:55.785 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:10:53.549 --> 01:10:58.588 region:rollup2
TO TO INCREASE PERMEABILITY

01:10:55.785 --> 01:11:00.590 region:rollup2
THREE TO INCREASE GREENSPACE AND

01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:02.391 region:rollup2
FOR WAS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:04.560 region:rollup2
OF STORM WATER HARVESTING.

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:07.697 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS WAS IN AN EFFORT.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:09.165 region:rollup2
NOT FOR THE CITY TO REDUCE I.

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:11.601 region:rollup2
BEAT COOL THE CITY BY FOUR

01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:13.803 region:rollup2
DEGREES CENTIGRADE OR ABOUT

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:14.770 region:rollup2
SEVEN DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:16.672 region:rollup2
SO HOW OF THE CHANGE GIVEN THEIR

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:18.407 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:20.209 region:rollup2
ONE THEY BEGAN TO SIGNIFICANTLY

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:22.078 region:rollup2
INVEST IN KEEPING THEIR TREES

01:11:20.209 --> 01:11:25.214 region:rollup2
HEALTH BEING MAINTAINED IN THIS

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:26.949 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE I JUST GAVE YOU THE CITY

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:28.985 region:rollup2
CITY ALONE OF MOUNTAIN. INVESTED

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:31.554 region:rollup2
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:32.722 region:rollup2
YEARS A INTO THE FOUR STRATEGIES

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:34.223 region:rollup2
I JUST MENTIONED.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:36.492 region:rollup2
SECOND THE CREATING NEW SOURCES

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:37.994 region:rollup2
OF WATER STORMWATER CAPTURE IN

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:39.796 region:rollup2
SOME CASES THEY WENT AS FAR AS

01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:41.063 region:rollup2
TAPPING INTO STORES TREATING THE

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:43.166 region:rollup2
WATER AND THEN USING THAT TO

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:44.267 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THEIR TREES. AND THEY

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:46.302 region:rollup2
CHANGE THEIR LAWS POLICIES IN

01:11:44.267 --> 01:11:48.871 region:rollup2
AND SENTENCED TO TAKE.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:50.373 region:rollup2
TO HELP THE URBAN FOREST DRIVE

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:52.241 region:rollup2
AND TAKE AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE

01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:53.409 region:rollup2
AGAINST THEIR NEW HARSH CLIMATE

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:54.510 region:rollup2
REALITY.

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:56.179 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK ACROSS

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.380 region:rollup2
THE OCEAN TO LEARN THESE LESSONS

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:59.015 region:rollup2
WE CAN LEARN BECOME LOOK IN OUR

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:00.283 region:rollup2
OWN BACKYARD.

01:11:59.015 --> 01:12:02.118 region:rollup2
I TREAT PEOPLE WE ARE NOW

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:04.487 region:rollup2
LEADING A NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE

01:12:02.118 --> 01:12:06.088 region:rollup2
ON URBAN COOLING WITH YALE UCLA

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:08.357 region:rollup2
AND SEVERAL OTHERS. AND RIGHT

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:11.027 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE MODELING AT THE COUNTY

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:13.396 region:rollup2
OF LA THE OPTIMAL PRESCRIPTION

01:12:11.027 --> 01:12:15.431 region:rollup2
THE COMBINATION OF VEGETATION

01:12:13.396 --> 01:12:18.034 region:rollup2
INCLUDING TREES AND REFLECTIVE

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:19.535 region:rollup2
SURFACES. TO DECREASE HUMAN

01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:20.870 region:rollup2
MORTALITY IN TIMES OF EXTREME

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.737 region:rollup2
HEAT.

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.773 region:rollup2
SOME GONNA GIVE YOU JUST A FEW

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:26.142 region:rollup2
INITIAL RESULTS.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:27.677 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS UNFORTUNATELY LA'S

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:29.645 region:rollup2
UNIQUE DISTINCTION BUT SAID WE

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:32.748 region:rollup2
HAVE A GREATER NUMBER OF WINTER

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:34.550 region:rollup2
DAYS ABOVE NINETY DEGREES THAN

01:12:32.748 --> 01:12:35.985 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER REGION IN THE COUNTRY.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.119 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT WE OCCASIONALLY

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:39.188 region:rollup2
HAVE HEAT RELATED DEATHS

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:41.524 region:rollup2
EVEN IN THE WINTER.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:43.159 region:rollup2
SECOND ME MORTALITY INCREASES

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:45.728 region:rollup2
FIVE TIMES FROM THE FIRST TO THE

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:47.797 region:rollup2
FIFTH. CONSECUTIVE DAY.

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:50.333 region:rollup2
AND THE AFTER THE FIFTH DAY

01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:52.335 region:rollup2
MORTALITY RISK OF A IN LOS

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:54.337 region:rollup2
ANGELES INCREASES FORTY SIX

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:55.705 region:rollup2
PERCENT HISPANIC COMMUNITIES AND

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:58.074 region:rollup2
FORTY EIGHT PERCENT AN ELDERLY

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:59.809 region:rollup2
BLACK COMMUNITIES.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:13:02.678 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS

01:12:59.809 --> 01:13:04.347 region:rollup2
STUDIES ARE SHOWING THAT ANY

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:05.815 region:rollup2
INCREASE COMBINATION THAT THEIR

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:07.316 region:rollup2
MODELING OF INCREASED?

01:13:05.815 --> 01:13:10.686 region:rollup2
TREES AND VEGETATION AND OUR

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:12.755 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVITY RESULTS IN AT LEAST

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:15.358 region:rollup2
DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:17.693 region:rollup2
DECREASES AND HE WON MORTALITY

01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:18.828 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE ANSWERS OUT THERE.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:21.464 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR LIKE TO SHIFT YOUR

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:23.366 region:rollup2
COUPLE LOCAL EXAMPLES OF WHAT A

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:25.234 region:rollup2
TREE PLANTINGS ARE DOING IN OUR

01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:26.335 region:rollup2
LOCAL COMMUNITIES BY LOCAL I

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:28.037 region:rollup2
MEAN LOS ANGELES BECAUSE THAT'S

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:30.139 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE BASED.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:32.275 region:rollup2
FIRST AS PART OF OUR SCHOOL

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:34.143 region:rollup2
GREENING INITIATIVE SHE PEOPLE

01:13:32.275 --> 01:13:35.811 region:rollup2
RECEIVED HELLFIRE FUNDING TO DO

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:37.813 region:rollup2
SOME GREAT WORK AT CHATSWORTH

01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:39.482 region:rollup2
PARK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:40.683 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR STAFFERS GUY WORK

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:42.685 region:rollup2
WITH THE GREEN TEAM OF PARENTS

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:44.086 region:rollup2
AND TEACHERS REMOVED CONCRETE

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:46.389 region:rollup2
PLANTED TWENTY FOUR TREES ON THE

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.990 region:rollup2
PLAYGROUND THEY CREATED A

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:49.091 region:rollup2
READING GROW FOR THE KIDS.

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:50.660 region:rollup2
THE KIDS ARE REALLY TAKING

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:53.229 region:rollup2
OWNERSHIP OF THESE TREES THEY

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:54.797 region:rollup2
WATER THEM. BUT THE REAL ISSUE

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:57.166 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT'S NOW PROVIDING THE

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:59.402 region:rollup2
KIDS WITH A RESPITE FROM THE

01:13:57.166 --> 01:14:01.771 region:rollup2
WIND AND THE HEAT IN THIS VERY

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:03.773 region:rollup2
HOT AND WINDY AREA.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.774 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER HANDOUT

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.374 region:rollup2
I'VE PROVIDED HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.877 region:rollup2
IT.

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:11.714 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS SHOWS IS A TYPICAL

01:14:07.877 --> 01:14:12.348 region:rollup2
STREET ON A VERY COOL DAY AT

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:14.116 region:rollup2
SEVENTY THREE DEGREES ON THIS

01:14:12.348 --> 01:14:15.985 region:rollup2
DAY? ON BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:17.753 region:rollup2
PICTURE ON THE RIGHT WITH A

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:19.655 region:rollup2
SPECIAL INFRARED CAMERA. IT

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:21.891 region:rollup2
SHOWS YOU THAT THE UNSHADED

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:23.426 region:rollup2
SIDEWALK IS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:25.428 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:28.664 region:rollup2
THE SHEET INSIDE WHAT HOWEVER IS

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:30.666 region:rollup2
EIGHTY TWO DEGREES SO THAT TREED

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:32.068 region:rollup2
MADE A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:34.437 region:rollup2
DEGREE DIFFERENCE FOR THE

01:14:32.068 --> 01:14:35.604 region:rollup2
PEDESTRIAN EXPERIENCE.

01:14:34.437 --> 01:14:36.772 region:rollup2
THE LAST EXAMPLE IS THAT

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:38.374 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO TREAT

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:40.209 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH FUNDS TO PLAN

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:41.977 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN HUNDRED TREES AND

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:43.179 region:rollup2
PARKWAYS IN. A COMMERCIAL

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.280 region:rollup2
QUARTERS AND HUNTING TO PARKING

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:45.648 region:rollup2
CUT A HATE THROUGH MARCH TWENTY

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.983 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:48.751 region:rollup2
THESE PLANTINGS ARE GOING TO

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:50.519 region:rollup2
INCLUDE IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:14:48.751 --> 01:14:51.787 region:rollup2
AND BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:53.289 region:rollup2
THROUGH HEAT REDUCING SHADING

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:54.890 region:rollup2
CLEANER AIR.

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:56.726 region:rollup2
SO OF COURSE IN ADDITION TO

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:58.494 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE URBAN TREE CANOPY

01:14:56.726 --> 01:15:00.363 region:rollup2
BY FOURTEEN HUNDRED TREES IT'S

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.797 region:rollup2
GOING TO CREATE LOCAL JOBS. AND

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:03.232 region:rollup2
INSPIRE RESIDENTS TO CHANGE

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.667 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIOR HOW WILL IT DO

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:06.569 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.838 region:rollup2
BECAUSE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:10.740 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ARE EXTREMELY VITAL

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:12.141 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS TO THIS WORK.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:13.576 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE VOLUNTEERS IN THE

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:15.044 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ARE RECRUITED DIRECTLY

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:16.779 region:rollup2
BY REGIONAL MANAGER AT HIGH

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:18.681 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS CHURCHES COMMUNITY BASED

01:15:16.779 --> 01:15:20.449 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.817 region:rollup2
OUT RESIDENTS ON EACH STREET

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:23.686 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:25.554 region:rollup2
PLANTINGS ARE PARTICIPATING. AND

01:15:23.686 --> 01:15:28.657 region:rollup2
EVERY VOLUNTEER WORK DAY BEGINS

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:30.292 region:rollup2
WITH A TREE CARE AYE TRAINING.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:32.061 region:rollup2
ALSO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ARE

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:34.263 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED TO OTHER HOMES NOT

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:35.398 region:rollup2
INVOLVED SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:36.665 region:rollup2
THE BENEFITS OF TREES.

01:15:35.398 --> 01:15:38.000 region:rollup2
WE CHOSE THESE COMMUNITIES

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:40.436 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH POPULATION

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.904 region:rollup2
DENSITY OF EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND%

01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:44.140 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS IN JUST OVER FOUR

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:45.541 region:rollup2
SQUARE MILES. IS COMMUNITIES

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.742 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY HAVE A LACK OF AIR

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:49.211 region:rollup2
CONDITIONING.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:51.013 region:rollup2
LOW TREE CANOPY IN OTHER WAYS

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:52.581 region:rollup2
TO COMBAT THE EXTREME HEAT.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:54.150 region:rollup2
MODELING SUGGEST THAT BOTH IN

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:56.585 region:rollup2
HUNTINGTON PARK CUT HAY COULD

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:57.586 region:rollup2
HAVE THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE D.

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:59.121 region:rollup2
NONE NUMBER OF DAYS WITH

01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:00.923 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURES OVER NINETY FIVE

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:02.858 region:rollup2
DEGREES AND AS LITTLE AS. TWENTY

01:16:00.923 --> 01:16:04.860 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS AND OF COURSE AIR

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:06.695 region:rollup2
QUALITY IS ALSO A CHALLENGE.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.631 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:10.132 region:rollup2
ONE COMMUNITY. THEIR HUNDRED AND

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:11.434 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR IDENTIFIED

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.967 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN LOS

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:14.103 region:rollup2
ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTY

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:15.304 region:rollup2
ALONE.

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:17.139 region:rollup2
HUGE PARTS OF OUR POPULATION ARE

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:18.641 region:rollup2
AT RISK

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:20.276 region:rollup2
SO IN CLOSING WE ASKED THE

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:22.745 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SHE CAN. SHOULD

01:16:20.276 --> 01:16:24.447 region:rollup2
INVEST IN URBAN FORESTRY NOW DO

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:26.415 region:rollup2
AS MANY FUNDING VEHICLES AS

01:16:24.447 --> 01:16:28.317 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE THIS SHOULD BE AMONGST

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:33.789 region:rollup2
OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY TO PROTECT

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:35.791 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES THANK YOU.

01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:36.492 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON CHARTER CO SENATE

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:38.327 region:rollup2
RISE OF STAFF.

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:40.496 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I'M

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:41.864 region:rollup2
EAGER ELECTION I'M YOUR UNIVERSE

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:44.033 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COOPERATIVE EXTENSION

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:45.367 region:rollup2
ADVISER BASED OUT OF SAM

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:46.869 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS AND CISCO COUNTIES.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:49.338 region:rollup2
AND I HELP

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:51.373 region:rollup2
BERMAN CREE MANAGERS.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:52.875 region:rollup2
DO THEIR JOB SUSTAINABLY.

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:54.577 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS OUR COMMUTE BENEFIT

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:56.812 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:58.814 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS.

01:16:56.812 --> 01:17:00.115 region:rollup2
SO OFTEN SOME A LITTLE DIFFERENT

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:01.650 region:rollup2
BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST TRY

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:04.553 region:rollup2
TO WRAP UP BY KIND OF

01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:05.488 region:rollup2
SUMMARIZING THE THREE KINDS OF

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.222 region:rollup2
BENEFITS WE DERIVE FROM URBAN

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:08.691 region:rollup2
TREES.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:10.426 region:rollup2
.

01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:12.194 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S KIND

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:14.930 region:rollup2
OF UNIQUE TO URBAN TREES SECOND

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:16.132 region:rollup2
THINK OF IT.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.766 region:rollup2
CAN THINK OF A FIRST CATEGORY

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:19.201 region:rollup2
THE BENEFIT THAT TREES PROVIDE

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:21.737 region:rollup2
TO OTHER LIVING THINGS YOU KNOW

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:23.706 region:rollup2
BIRDS BEES ALL OF THAT STUFF THE

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:25.474 region:rollup2
ECOLOGICAL SIDE OF THINGS.

01:17:23.706 --> 01:17:27.643 region:rollup2
THE SECOND KIND OF BENEFITS

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:28.811 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:30.446 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS MENTIONED QUITE A

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:31.647 region:rollup2
BIT ORANGE TODAY THOSE ARE ALL

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:33.082 region:rollup2
THE THINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.850 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PAY FOR.

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.784 region:rollup2
SO IF A TREE SHADE YOUR HOUSE

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.353 region:rollup2
AND YOU DON'T OF THROWING

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:39.588 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION AS MUCH.

01:17:37.353 --> 01:17:41.457 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE.

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:42.892 region:rollup2
AND UNIVERSITY RESEARCH OVER THE

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:45.427 region:rollup2
LAST TWENTY YEARS HAS REALLY

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:46.996 region:rollup2
QUANTIFY THAT SO.

01:17:45.427 --> 01:17:47.596 region:rollup2
WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT IT WAS NICE

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.697 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A TREE SHEDDING THEIR

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.965 region:rollup2
HOUSE.

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:51.534 region:rollup2
BUT STARTING ABOUT TWENTY YEARS

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:52.968 region:rollup2
AGO WE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT A

01:17:51.534 --> 01:17:54.603 region:rollup2
NUMBER ON IT.

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.938 region:rollup2
SO THAT AND IN FACT YOUR

01:17:54.603 --> 01:17:58.207 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND DOCUMENT SUMMARIZES

01:17:55.938 --> 01:17:59.708 region:rollup2
THAT VERY NICELY THE BENEFITS OF

01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:01.610 region:rollup2
THOSE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES.

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:04.079 region:rollup2
OUR SUMMER AROUND EIGHT BILLION

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:06.582 region:rollup2
DOLLARS PER YEAR IN CALIFORNIA.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:09.118 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:10.085 region:rollup2
THE THIRD KIND OF TRUE BENEFITS

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:11.654 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:13.255 region:rollup2
EXCITING PART AND I'M GLAD CINDY

01:18:11.654 --> 01:18:14.557 region:rollup2
MENTIONED. MENTION THEM RD

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:16.191 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFITS.

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:17.560 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS REALLY RECENT

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:20.829 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY RESEARCH GOING BACK

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:23.532 region:rollup2
ONLY ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS.

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:24.833 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO QUANTIFY.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:26.168 region:rollup2
EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH AND

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.469 region:rollup2
AGAIN IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT I

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.405 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THIS IS SURPRISING

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:31.640 region:rollup2
TO ANYBODY TO SAY THAT.

01:18:29.405 --> 01:18:33.742 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.777 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS IN MORE TREES TEND

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.845 region:rollup2
TO BE HEALTHIER DESERVE JUST

01:18:34.777 --> 01:18:38.147 region:rollup2
NICER PLACES TO LIVE. BUT REALLY

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:39.315 region:rollup2
QUANTIFYING THOSE EFFECTS OF

01:18:38.147 --> 01:18:41.417 region:rollup2
BEEN DIFFICULT.

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:42.785 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO ABOUT THE EARLY

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:45.888 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSANDS

01:18:42.785 --> 01:18:47.957 region:rollup2
WE NOW HAVE NUMBERS THAT SHOW.

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:50.993 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN CARDIOVASCULAR

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:53.562 region:rollup2
DISEASE THAT SHOW REDUCTION IN.

01:18:50.993 --> 01:18:55.097 region:rollup2
OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:56.565 region:rollup2
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT REDUCTION

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:58.634 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST THE TEN PERCENT

01:18:56.565 --> 01:19:00.970 region:rollup2
INCREASE INCREASE COVER WHICH IS

01:18:58.634 --> 01:19:02.504 region:rollup2
REALLY QUITE AMAZING THERE'S

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.839 region:rollup2
RENDON THESE ARE VERY CAREFULLY

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.507 region:rollup2
DONE STUDIES THAT.

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:07.209 region:rollup2
I FIND DIFFICULT THREE BUT

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:09.411 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE.

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:10.012 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE MOST RECENT

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.280 region:rollup2
STUDIES COMES FROM BRITAIN AND

01:19:10.012 --> 01:19:12.448 region:rollup2
IT.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:14.984 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:16.418 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW THAT.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:17.853 region:rollup2
RICH PEOPLE ON THE WHOLE ARE

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:19.321 region:rollup2
GENERALLY HEALTHIER THAN.

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:21.857 region:rollup2
POOR PEOPLE RIGHT.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:23.292 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:19:21.857 --> 01:19:24.827 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BETTER ACCESS

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:26.428 region:rollup2
TO URBAN TREES IN URBAN

01:19:24.827 --> 01:19:28.564 region:rollup2
GREENSPACE THAT DISPARITY

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:30.699 region:rollup2
NARROWS AND IN FACT IT'S A FORTY

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:33.469 region:rollup2
PERCENT DIFFERENCE IN

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:34.737 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES? SO GIVEN THAT.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:36.705 region:rollup2
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS

01:19:34.737 --> 01:19:38.941 region:rollup2
ARE OFTEN VERY LIMITED AND GIVEN

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:40.876 region:rollup2
THAT WE. HAVE THE. ECONOMIC

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:43.612 region:rollup2
DISPARITIES WE HAVE IN MANY OF

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:45.080 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITIES. TREES REPRESENT

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:46.482 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA OF AN EQUITY GENIC

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.250 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:49.418 region:rollup2
BE DONE TO REDUCE

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:51.620 region:rollup2
THE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:53.689 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:55.724 region:rollup2
NOW TO ACHIEVE ALL THIS.

01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:57.192 region:rollup2
OF WE HAVE TO NOT ONLY PLANT

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:59.361 region:rollup2
TREES BUT MAKE SURE THOSE TREES

01:19:57.192 --> 01:20:00.262 region:rollup2
SURVIVE AND THIS IS WHERE MY

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.264 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES FROM MARISSA

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:04.033 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:05.601 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT.

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:06.635 region:rollup2
TEND TO BE GOING AFTER OUT TREES

01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:08.303 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:09.672 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND THOSE ARE DE

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:11.273 region:rollup2
INVASIVE FRAUD HOLE BORERS AND

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:13.709 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:15.044 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY RECENT TREAT DISEASES

01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:17.012 region:rollup2
UP AND IT'S CERTAIN IMPORTANT TO

01:20:15.044 --> 01:20:19.048 region:rollup2
REMEMBER THAT THE TREE CANOPY WE

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:20.549 region:rollup2
SEE TODAY.

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:21.150 region:rollup2
IS THE RESULT OF PAST MANAGEMENT

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:23.752 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU WALK.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:25.220 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:26.989 region:rollup2
DOWNTOWN AND MIDTOWN SACRAMENTO

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:28.090 region:rollup2
YOU'RE REALLY SEEING THE EFFORTS

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.291 region:rollup2
OF URBAN FORESTERS FROM A LONG

01:20:28.090 --> 01:20:31.460 region:rollup2
TIME AGO.

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:32.828 region:rollup2
SO. IT'S REALLY QUITE IMPORTANT

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.129 region:rollup2
THAT WE NOT ONLY CONTINUE

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:35.564 region:rollup2
PLANTING TREES BUT CONTINUE

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:37.333 region:rollup2
FINDING WAYS TO INTEGRATE THEM

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:39.435 region:rollup2
INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:41.737 region:rollup2
SO THE FACT TWENTY THIRTY FIFTY

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:43.038 region:rollup2
YEARS FROM NOW UP PEOPLE COME

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:44.106 region:rollup2
AFTER US CONCEDED THIS WAS THIS

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:46.175 region:rollup2
WAS A GOOD IDEA.

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:47.676 region:rollup2
AND I'M I'M ESPECIALLY MY OWN

01:20:46.175 --> 01:20:49.812 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IS A SPECIAL INTERESTS

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:52.614 region:rollup2
THAT IN AND.

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:53.749 region:rollup2
UP TREAT THIS SERVICES NAMELY

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:55.551 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS WITH TREES FAILING

01:20:53.749 --> 01:20:58.187 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN REDUCE THAT.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:59.822 region:rollup2
TREAT FAILURE BUT ALSO HOW WE

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:01.423 region:rollup2
TRANSITION INTO THIS REALLY

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:03.692 region:rollup2
ENVISIONED INFRASTRUCTURE ABOUT

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:05.360 region:rollup2
MARRYING MENTION WHERE WE USE AT

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.096 region:rollup2
LEAST THREE NEW SOURCES OF WATER

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.531 region:rollup2
GRAY WATER RECYCLED WATER AND

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:11.667 region:rollup2
STORING WATER. TO SUPPLY WATER

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:12.301 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF TREES. SO.

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:19.007 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS MORE

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:20.442 region:rollup2
COMPLEX IN OUR URBAN

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:21.710 region:rollup2
FOREST AND THAT'S OKAY.

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:23.612 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WILL ALSO GET MORE

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:26.548 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE AND BETTER

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:27.649 region:rollup2

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:41.910 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. IT'S OFTEN HARDER

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:42.544 region:rollup2
TO INVEST MONEY THAT UNDERSERVED

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.679 region:rollup2
AREAS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:45.080 region:rollup2
FIRST.

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:47.015 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERE ISN'T A WAY TO

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.649 region:rollup2
SUSTAIN IF WE PLANT TREES WHO'S

01:24:47.015 --> 01:24:49.484 region:rollup2
GOING TO WATER THEM WHO'S GOING

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:51.119 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

01:24:49.484 --> 01:24:52.454 region:rollup2
AND OFTEN TIMES THERE ARE.

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:54.256 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTION

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:55.757 region:rollup2
URBAN CORE.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:57.392 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THE ONES HE OFTEN GO AND

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.160 region:rollup2
PLANTED TREES AND SOMETIMES TAKE

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.761 region:rollup2
CARE OF THEM BUT THEY NEED A

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.063 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCE IF WE PROVIDE

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:02.564 region:rollup2
THAT FUNDING SOURCE.

01:25:01.063 --> 01:25:04.099 region:rollup2
IF WE PROVIDE MATCHING MONEY TO

01:25:02.564 --> 01:25:05.367 region:rollup2
OUR PARKS PUNK HOW CAN WE DO

01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:06.969 region:rollup2
BETTER. HOW CAN WE?

01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:09.404 region:rollup2
?

01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:11.740 region:rollup2
DO A BETTER DELIVERY OF OF OF.

01:25:09.404 --> 01:25:13.041 region:rollup2
SERVICE A FUNDING.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.676 region:rollup2
AND AND EVERYTHING AS A WHOLE TO

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:16.211 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:17.746 region:rollup2
DON'T THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.614 region:rollup2
WE HAVE REALLY GOING TO THESE

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:20.282 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS AND MAKE THE TAKE

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:21.850 region:rollup2
MAKE.

01:25:20.282 --> 01:25:23.452 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:25.387 region:rollup2
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:26.822 region:rollup2
SHAUNA. YES AND I'M ACTUALLY SO

01:25:25.387 --> 01:25:28.423 region:rollup2
GLAD YOU RAISED THAT.

01:25:26.822 --> 01:25:29.658 region:rollup2
NINETY TWO PERCENT OF THESE

01:25:28.423 --> 01:25:31.360 region:rollup2
FUNDS WENT INTO DISADVANTAGED

01:25:29.658 --> 01:25:32.327 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BUT THERE ARE MANY

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.862 region:rollup2
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:35.130 region:rollup2
THE STATE THAT EITHER DIDN'T

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:37.099 region:rollup2
KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.834 region:rollup2
DO COULDN'T TAKE ON THE

01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:39.668 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT AYE RESPONSIBILITY

01:25:38.834 --> 01:25:42.471 region:rollup2
IS.

01:25:39.668 --> 01:25:43.538 region:rollup2
THE LIABILITY I DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:45.207 region:rollup2
CAPACITY SHIRLEY RIGHT THERE

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:47.075 region:rollup2
GRANTED THERE SO MANY BARRIERS

01:25:45.207 --> 01:25:48.143 region:rollup2
TO APPLICATION FOR UNDERSTOOD

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:51.213 region:rollup2
RESOURCE COMMUNITIES.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:52.514 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT IN THIS PROGRAM BUT I

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:53.649 region:rollup2
WE ARE SPONSORING A BELL WITH

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:54.883 region:rollup2
SOME PARTNERS I'M IN THE

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.484 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW GREEN LINING

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:57.719 region:rollup2
INSTITUTE.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:26:00.389 region:rollup2
SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY TWO

01:25:57.719 --> 01:26:01.089 region:rollup2
THAT IS ABOUT BUILDING REGIONAL

01:26:00.389 --> 01:26:03.291 region:rollup2
CAPACITY

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:05.460 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING FUNDING TO

01:26:03.291 --> 01:26:07.095 region:rollup2
REGIONS SO THAT THEY CAN BUILD

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.864 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN CAPACITY. THIS TAKES

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:10.799 region:rollup2
PLANNING THE STATE'S ACTUAL

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:12.501 region:rollup2
STAFF THIS TAKES A BUDGET SERVER

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:13.435 region:rollup2
CONSULTANT SUPPORT TO HELP WITH

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.803 region:rollup2
THE GREENHOUSE GAS

01:26:13.435 --> 01:26:16.705 region:rollup2
QUANTIFICATION THAN OTHER

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:19.074 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL P. SAYS. THEY'RE ALL

01:26:16.705 --> 01:26:19.908 region:rollup2
OF THESE AYE CAPACITY THAT IT

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:22.010 region:rollup2
TAKES TO ACTUALLY COMPETE FOR

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:23.812 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDS IT NOT ENOUGH RIGHT

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.213 region:rollup2
I THINK YOUR POINT IS IS RIGHT

01:26:23.812 --> 01:26:26.648 region:rollup2
ON POINT IN TERMS OF IT'S NOT

01:26:25.213 --> 01:26:27.082 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO DESIGNATE DESIGNATE

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:28.283 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO UNDERSERVED

01:26:27.082 --> 01:26:30.419 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:32.287 region:rollup2
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AND ESSENTIAL

01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:33.288 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NOW HAVE TO GO IN AND

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:35.657 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE WE'RE INCREASING THE

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:36.925 region:rollup2
CAPACITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:38.660 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND COMPETE

01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:40.028 region:rollup2
FOR FUNDS. AND THEN ON THE OTHER

01:26:38.660 --> 01:26:41.863 region:rollup2
SIDE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:44.232 region:rollup2
STATE HAS SUFFICIENT TECHNICAL

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:46.234 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE AND STREAMLINING AND

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:48.704 region:rollup2
ALIGNING THEIR PROGRAM

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:49.771 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND APPLICATION

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:51.239 region:rollup2
TIMELINES AND REQUIREMENTS.

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:52.774 region:rollup2
I'M SO I THINK THERE'S THE ROLE

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:54.109 region:rollup2
OF WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES ON

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:55.644 region:rollup2
THE GROUND AND REALLY INCREASING

01:26:54.109 --> 01:26:58.346 region:rollup2
THAT CAPACITY AND THE ROLE OF

01:26:55.644 --> 01:27:01.083 region:rollup2
STREAMLINING AND MAKING SURE OUR

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:03.351 region:rollup2
STATE PROCESSES ARE AS.

01:27:01.083 --> 01:27:04.519 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOW STREAMLINED AND USER

01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:06.855 region:rollup2
FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:27:04.519 --> 01:27:08.156 region:rollup2
AND SO AGAIN NOT WHAT THIS IS

01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:09.925 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUT THERE WE ARE WORKING

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.659 region:rollup2
ON A BILL THAT WOULD DO SOME OF

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.627 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS

01:27:10.659 --> 01:27:13.729 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND. AND

01:27:12.627 --> 01:27:15.497 region:rollup2
DOING THINGS THE WAY WE'VE DONE

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:16.565 region:rollup2
THEM PASSED MEAN THAT MONEY WILL

01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:17.632 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO GO TO THE

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:19.167 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE

01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:20.902 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO APPLY FOR THEM

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:22.604 region:rollup2
VERSES ALL THE OTHER COMMUNITIES

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.839 region:rollup2
THAT NEED THE MONEY JUST AS BAD

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:24.339 region:rollup2
IF NOT WORSE.

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.775 region:rollup2
AND.

01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:27.476 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:29.044 region:rollup2
THAT I WANT TO LOOK OUT FOR THAT

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:30.645 region:rollup2
BILL SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT IT

01:27:29.044 --> 01:27:32.848 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IT

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:33.782 region:rollup2
ACCOMPLISHES SCHOOL. AND ALSO

01:27:32.848 --> 01:27:36.618 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I REPRESENT.

01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:38.086 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF THE.

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:39.421 region:rollup2
CITIES WITH THE WORST AIR

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.756 region:rollup2
QUALITY IN THE NATION.

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:42.290 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ON SENDING WILL COUNTY

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:44.025 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE WORSE IS PARTY LOGAN

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:45.627 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE PORT. EMISSIONS

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:46.862 region:rollup2
AND DOES.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:48.263 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS ALSO TEND TO BE

01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:49.998 region:rollup2
PARK DEFICIENT.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.899 region:rollup2
TREAT EFFICIENT.

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:52.634 region:rollup2
AND.

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:54.035 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO.

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:55.170 region:rollup2
CRITICS THEY PROGRAM HERE THAT

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:56.605 region:rollup2
REALLY TARGETS PUTTING TREES IN

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:58.940 region:rollup2
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:27:56.605 --> 01:28:00.642 region:rollup2
EL CENTRO IS ANOTHER ONE CUT

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:01.610 region:rollup2
CALEXICO IN AGAIN.

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:03.011 region:rollup2
I GO TO THOSE.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:04.713 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL AND THE

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:07.516 region:rollup2
VERY TREE DEFICIENT.

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:09.117 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALSO TEND TO HAVE OTHER

01:28:07.516 --> 01:28:10.886 region:rollup2
PARTICULATE MATTER THERE. THAT

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:12.587 region:rollup2
COME FROM AGRICULTURE SO THOSE

01:28:10.886 --> 01:28:14.356 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THE CHALLENGES EIGHT THE

01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:16.558 region:rollup2
DEAL BUT THEY WOULD NICE. TO IT

01:28:14.356 --> 01:28:19.227 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NICE TO SEE.

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:21.229 region:rollup2
US ARE TO OUR OUR PRIORITIZATION

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:22.364 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF FUNDS TO MAKE SURE

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:23.865 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE WE TARGET THOSE FUNDS

01:28:22.364 --> 01:28:25.400 region:rollup2
FOR COMMUNITIES.

01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:26.468 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE REALLY POOR AIR

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.802 region:rollup2
QUALITY WILL WE HAVE A HIGH

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:30.038 region:rollup2
ASTHMA RATES.

01:28:27.802 --> 01:28:31.506 region:rollup2
AND WERE.

01:28:30.038 --> 01:28:33.308 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WE'RE DEALING WITH SOME

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:35.210 region:rollup2
OF SOLUTIONS OF. ONE OF THE

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:37.179 region:rollup2
CAUSES OF THAT PICKED PARTICULAR

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:37.946 region:rollup2
MATTER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES.

01:28:37.179 --> 01:28:40.782 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD BE.

01:28:37.946 --> 01:28:43.084 region:rollup2
ONE OF THAT THE REMEDIES TO

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:44.586 region:rollup2
HELP US ACCOMPLISH ON THE TREES.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:47.355 region:rollup2
AND I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW WE CAN.

01:28:44.586 --> 01:28:48.523 region:rollup2
WORK TO DEVELOP MORE.

AND ALSO VERY ENCOURAGING I HAD

01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:55.730 region:rollup2
NO IDEA WHERE INVESTING THIS

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:57.065 region:rollup2
MONEY MATURE TREES.

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:59.067 region:rollup2
I WAS A LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBERS

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:01.903 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVE LOCAL PROGRAM.

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:03.738 region:rollup2
I PLANNING TREES OUT THERE AND.

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:06.808 region:rollup2
.

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:08.743 region:rollup2
I I'VE ALWAYS. BEEN EXTREMELY

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:11.179 region:rollup2
OPPOSED PROJECTS THAT.

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:13.148 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW HAVE THAT THAT THAT THE.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:15.851 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT OF REMOVING TREES

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:16.351 region:rollup2
FROM THE ENVIRONMENT WE GOTTA.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.820 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:20.822 region:rollup2
IT INTO IN IN DOING NEW

01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:22.190 region:rollup2
PROJECTS AND AND PROPOSING

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:24.159 region:rollup2
FUTURE PROJECTS THAT THEY

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:25.460 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE INCORPORATE GREEN

01:29:24.159 --> 01:29:26.995 region:rollup2
AREAS ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.596 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED AREA SO.

01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:30.365 region:rollup2
THIS WAS VERY FORMATIVE THANK

PLEASE. ONE ATTACK ON.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.703 region:rollup2
I JUST HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL

01:29:33.335 --> 01:29:36.137 region:rollup2
COMMENT ENTRIES ARE REALLY

01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:37.005 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR ALL THESE REASONS

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:38.240 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:39.608 region:rollup2
FIRST BUFFERING FOR POLLUTION

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.909 region:rollup2
ETCETERA. AND I THINK THE OTHER

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:42.611 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE NEED TO LEARN FROM

01:29:40.909 --> 01:29:44.312 region:rollup2
IS IS THE DROUGHT THAT WE HAD A

01:29:42.611 --> 01:29:45.714 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND WE NEED TO

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:47.882 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE.

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:49.050 region:rollup2
GET THE MESSAGE OUT RIGHT AWAY

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:50.285 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN WE SAY TURN OFF THE

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.820 region:rollup2
WATER TO THE LONG WE'RE NOT

01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:53.288 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT THE TREES AND THAT

01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:54.322 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS WE

01:29:53.288 --> 01:29:55.457 region:rollup2
SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.592 region:rollup2
SILICON VALLEY IN THE STATE TO

01:29:55.457 --> 01:29:58.627 region:rollup2
HAVE. NEW HIGH TECH WAYS OF

01:29:57.592 --> 01:30:00.829 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF WATER INTO THE

01:29:58.627 --> 01:30:01.563 region:rollup2
AWARDING ENOUGH AND NOT TOO MUCH

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:04.165 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT RUNNING DOWN THE

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:06.801 region:rollup2
DRAIN. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:10.305 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT LEVERAGE HOW ONLY

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:10.939 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING THESE TREES IN THIS.

01:30:10.305 --> 01:30:11.673 region:rollup2
ARID ENVIRONMENT IF WE'RE GONNA

01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:13.675 region:rollup2
LIVE HERE.

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:16.011 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:30:13.675 --> 01:30:17.779 region:rollup2
YOU VERY MUCH MY QUESTION IS I

01:30:16.011 --> 01:30:19.481 region:rollup2
MEAN KNOW IF THERE'S A BALLPARK.

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:21.116 region:rollup2
FIGURE A NUMBER RIGHT THAT THAT

01:30:19.481 --> 01:30:22.651 region:rollup2
WE'VE ESTIMATED.

01:30:21.116 --> 01:30:24.152 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE THE

01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:26.054 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE NEED TODAY I MEAN YOU

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:28.290 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT.

01:30:26.054 --> 01:30:30.392 region:rollup2
AND THE. AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:32.661 region:rollup2
WERE AWARDED VERSUS THE AMOUNT

01:30:30.392 --> 01:30:34.663 region:rollup2
OF APPLICATIONS THAT CAME IN.

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:36.898 region:rollup2
I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THAT THREE

01:30:34.663 --> 01:30:38.833 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION ISN'T.

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:40.302 region:rollup2
EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT I THINK WE

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.503 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE IS NEEDED DOES ANYONE

01:30:40.302 --> 01:30:43.038 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY OF.

01:30:41.503 --> 01:30:44.272 region:rollup2
IDEA WHAT THAT BALLPARK FIGURE

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:46.207 region:rollup2
MAY LOOK LIKE.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:47.842 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:48.443 region:rollup2
THE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM WAS

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:50.312 region:rollup2
OVER SUBSCRIBE BY FOUR HUNDRED

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:52.647 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:53.515 region:rollup2
SO AND AND YOU YOU ALSO NEED TO

01:30:52.647 --> 01:30:54.883 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN FORCED TO

01:30:53.515 --> 01:30:56.084 region:rollup2
PROGRAM I THINK IS ONE OF THE

01:30:54.883 --> 01:30:58.954 region:rollup2
SMALLEST OF THE.

01:30:56.084 --> 01:31:01.022 region:rollup2
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS.

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:03.425 region:rollup2
WHERE THE SECOND SMALLEST?

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:04.759 region:rollup2
SO WERE I HAD TO MAKE A BAD PUN

01:31:03.425 --> 01:31:06.328 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO IT ALL TIME WHERE DROP

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:07.362 region:rollup2
IN THE BUCKET AS FAR AS. THE

01:31:06.328 --> 01:31:09.698 region:rollup2
SHORES WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

01:31:07.362 --> 01:31:10.231 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND WE COULD DO A LOT

01:31:09.698 --> 01:31:13.068 region:rollup2
MORE IF THAT AMOUNT WERE.

01:31:10.231 --> 01:31:14.436 region:rollup2
TRIPLED.

01:31:13.068 --> 01:31:16.137 region:rollup2
THEN IT'S WHY I MENTION RIGHT

01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:18.139 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:19.874 region:rollup2
MONEY IN THE PAST PROPOSITION

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:22.110 region:rollup2
SIXTY EIGHT.

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:23.445 region:rollup2
AND WASN'T TOO REPLACE WHAT WE

01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:24.946 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DOING ON AN ANNUAL

01:31:23.445 --> 01:31:26.881 region:rollup2
BASIS AND I WANNA.

01:31:24.946 --> 01:31:29.084 region:rollup2
AND CONTINUE TO HIT THAT HARD IN

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:29.751 region:rollup2
TERMS OF. GETTING COLLECTIVE

01:31:29.084 --> 01:31:31.786 region:rollup2
SUPPORT.

01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:33.421 region:rollup2
AS THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS ARE

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:35.323 region:rollup2
TAKING PLACE.

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:37.392 region:rollup2
INSULT YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT ON

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:39.294 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE VERY CRITICAL TO

01:31:37.392 --> 01:31:41.162 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT MESSAGE ACROSS.

01:31:39.294 --> 01:31:41.496 region:rollup2
IT CENTER BUT IF I CAN ALSO ADD

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.964 region:rollup2
SOME COMMENTS.

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:45.533 region:rollup2
.

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:48.770 region:rollup2
AND I'LL A HISTORICALLY WHEN THE

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:49.571 region:rollup2
FIRST EUROPEANS CAME CALIFORNIA.

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:51.339 region:rollup2
THERE WERE THERE WERE.

01:31:49.571 --> 01:31:53.808 region:rollup2
PINE.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:57.178 region:rollup2
TREFOREST AS FAR AS THE MIDDLE

01:31:53.808 --> 01:32:00.048 region:rollup2
PENINSULA OF BAJA CALIFORNIA.

01:31:57.178 --> 01:32:00.615 region:rollup2
AND. YOU KNOW THE WE WERE I

01:32:00.048 --> 01:32:02.083 region:rollup2
REPRESENT SAN DIEGO WHICH IS

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:03.885 region:rollup2
FAMOUS FOR

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:04.386 region:rollup2
TORY PINE WHICH IS KIND OF THE

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:05.653 region:rollup2
THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND

01:32:04.386 --> 01:32:08.723 region:rollup2
COASTAL.

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:10.492 region:rollup2
PINE TREE THAT. IS THREATENED.

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:12.460 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD OUT

01:32:10.492 --> 01:32:14.763 region:rollup2
THERE IN JULIAN FOR EXAMPLE HAVE

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:16.264 region:rollup2
DECIMATED. OR PINE.

01:32:14.763 --> 01:32:17.265 region:rollup2
WOULD FORCE OUT THERE WERE

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:19.067 region:rollup2
SCIENTISTS PREDICT IT'LL NEVER

01:32:17.265 --> 01:32:21.336 region:rollup2
REGENERATE.

01:32:19.067 --> 01:32:23.405 region:rollup2
THE LAST DROUGHT HAS CAUSED.

01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:24.606 region:rollup2
THIS INFESTATION OF BEETLE IN

01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:26.174 region:rollup2
THE PINE TREES UP THERE IN THE

01:32:24.606 --> 01:32:27.609 region:rollup2
MOUNTAINS.

01:32:26.174 --> 01:32:30.745 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE AFFECTED NOT THOUSANDS

01:32:27.609 --> 01:32:33.281 region:rollup2
OF TREES MILLIONS OF TREES.

01:32:30.745 --> 01:32:34.682 region:rollup2
AND AS MANY AS WERE PLANTED.

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:36.251 region:rollup2
WE REALLY CAN'T BACK FILL THE

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:38.953 region:rollup2
MUCH THAT HAS.

01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:41.222 region:rollup2
BEEN LOST THROUGH THIS DROUGHT

01:32:38.953 --> 01:32:42.824 region:rollup2
AND NATURAL FIRE. PROCESS THAT

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:44.793 region:rollup2
IS REALLY DEVASTATING THE AMOUNT

01:32:42.824 --> 01:32:45.927 region:rollup2
OF TREES IN OUR STATE.

01:32:44.793 --> 01:32:47.328 region:rollup2
I MEAN DOES NOT FOR LONG IS

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:48.930 region:rollup2
BEING ERODED ALMOST LIKE A

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:50.365 region:rollup2
CANCER ACROSS THE STATE GOING UP

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:52.567 region:rollup2
THIS FAR NORTH.

01:32:50.365 --> 01:32:53.134 region:rollup2
SHASTA COUNTY WE SAW THE FIRES

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.235 region:rollup2
LA COUNTY NAPA THAT THIS IS

01:32:53.134 --> 01:32:57.572 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:59.407 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:33:00.475 region:rollup2
IN THE END YOU KNOW IN IN YOUR

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:02.110 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION VERY LITTLE WAS

01:33:00.475 --> 01:33:04.012 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ABOUT.

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:06.114 region:rollup2
THE DEVASTATION OUR FORESTS AND

01:33:04.012 --> 01:33:07.482 region:rollup2
HOW THAT IS IS IS HAVING AN

01:33:06.114 --> 01:33:08.817 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON OUR QUALITY ACROSS THE

01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:10.852 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:12.487 region:rollup2
WAY BEYOND JUST THOSE AREAS THAT

01:33:10.852 --> 01:33:14.556 region:rollup2
ARE A CHALLENGE BY REGULAR.

01:33:12.487 --> 01:33:17.859 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW A LOCALIZED EMISSIONS

01:33:14.556 --> 01:33:20.161 region:rollup2
SUTTER CREEK POOR AIR QUALITY.

01:33:17.859 --> 01:33:22.063 region:rollup2
I MEAN WHY HOW MUCH. OF THIS

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:23.898 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY MAKING.

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:25.967 region:rollup2
A DENT IN FIVE

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:27.235 region:rollup2
AT LEAST BACK FEELING WHAT WAS

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:29.204 region:rollup2
LOST IN TWO WE KNOW.

01:33:27.235 --> 01:33:29.804 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE WISE.

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:31.706 region:rollup2
YEAH AND TERMS OF QUANTITY OF

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:32.240 region:rollup2
OF.

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:34.976 region:rollup2
TREES LOST IN THE LAST TEN

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.444 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:37.779 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IT TRYING TO

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.481 region:rollup2
RESTORE THAT EVEN IF IT'S DONE

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:41.282 region:rollup2
AT A LOCAL LEVEL NOT URBAN I

01:33:39.481 --> 01:33:42.884 region:rollup2
SAID HE'D. I KNOW.

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:45.286 region:rollup2
.

01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:47.722 region:rollup2
KILL FIRE WAS HERE AND.

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:47.989 region:rollup2
APPRECIATED THE COMMENTS BY MR.

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:50.158 region:rollup2
HANG BUT.

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:52.160 region:rollup2
.

01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:52.427 region:rollup2
DEWEY DO WE HAVE A OF FIGURE

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.562 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

01:33:52.427 --> 01:33:55.830 region:rollup2
.

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:57.031 region:rollup2
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT FOR SOME

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:58.933 region:rollup2
TO SAY MEASURE CERTAIN QUANTITY

01:33:57.031 --> 01:34:01.336 region:rollup2
THE QUANTITY OF TREASON IN JUST.

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:03.204 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE CAN'T.

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:05.206 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE. I MEAN MEASURING

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:06.307 region:rollup2
SEQUESTRATION INSULAR CARBON

01:34:05.206 --> 01:34:07.942 region:rollup2
SEQUESTRATION DIFFERENT.

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:09.077 region:rollup2
I'M THE SAME QUANTITY OF TREES

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:11.513 region:rollup2
WILL LIMIT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING

01:34:09.077 --> 01:34:15.116 region:rollup2
AT OUR STATE IN TERMS OF LOSSES.

01:34:11.513 --> 01:34:16.484 region:rollup2
VERSES GAINES.

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:17.852 region:rollup2
THE UPPER I COULD VOLUNTEER

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:19.387 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCER TWO TO ONE PART OF THE

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:21.322 region:rollup2
EQUATION.

01:34:19.387 --> 01:34:22.457 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TWO DATES

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:24.125 region:rollup2
THE OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS A

01:34:22.457 --> 01:34:26.528 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:28.496 region:rollup2
TREES ARE. ARE DEAD THE THREE

01:34:26.528 --> 01:34:29.731 region:rollup2
SOLD THE TEAM ONCOLOGY AND AND

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:30.665 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

01:34:29.731 --> 01:34:33.668 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT SOME

01:34:30.665 --> 01:34:35.670 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN.

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:38.673 region:rollup2
URBAN TREES AND.

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:40.141 region:rollup2
TREES IN IN THE FOREST.

01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:41.242 region:rollup2
AB DID THEIR OLD TREES AND

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:42.043 region:rollup2
THEY'LL DIE FROM THE SAME

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:44.345 region:rollup2
DISEASES.

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:45.680 region:rollup2
.

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:48.716 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.418 region:rollup2
AND ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:51.419 region:rollup2
TREES IN TOTAL.

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:53.288 region:rollup2
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE AT MY

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:55.089 region:rollup2
FINGERTIPS.

01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:56.824 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK PART OF THE EQUATION

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:58.159 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:59.961 region:rollup2
TREE MORTALITY ISSUE IS NOT SO

01:34:58.159 --> 01:35:01.429 region:rollup2
MUCH.

01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:04.265 region:rollup2
TRY TO REPLANT EVERY TREE THAT

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:06.034 region:rollup2
DIED. BUT RATHER FOCUSING ON.

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:07.569 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT'S

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:09.537 region:rollup2
OF FOREST THAT MAKES TO TREES

01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:11.439 region:rollup2
MORE RESILIENT.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:13.374 region:rollup2
THAT MAY JUST MEAN.

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:15.810 region:rollup2
FEWER TREES PER ACRE BUT THE

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:18.780 region:rollup2
ONES THAT ARE LEFT.

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:20.148 region:rollup2
ARE. MORE ARE ARE BETTER ABLE TO

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:22.750 region:rollup2
UTILIZE TO TOTAL AMOUNT THE

01:35:20.148 --> 01:35:24.319 region:rollup2
NUTRIENTS ON WATER ON THE SITE

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:26.287 region:rollup2
AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE.

01:35:24.319 --> 01:35:27.121 region:rollup2
AND AYE I THINK IGOR COULD

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:29.424 region:rollup2
EXPAND ON THIS AS WELL.

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:30.892 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:35:29.424 --> 01:35:32.594 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HELL YEAH I I WAS

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:33.628 region:rollup2
GOING TO SUGGEST THAT IT IS A

01:35:32.594 --> 01:35:34.395 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT ON THE SOME

01:35:33.628 --> 01:35:37.332 region:rollup2
OF THAT.

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:39.534 region:rollup2
WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

01:35:37.332 --> 01:35:41.703 region:rollup2
FOREST IN THE SIERRA. WILL

01:35:39.534 --> 01:35:44.038 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY RECOVER TO SOMETHING

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:45.273 region:rollup2
SO CERTAINLY. ACTIVE PLANTINGS

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:47.242 region:rollup2
NEEDED AND AND THAT'S HOW YOU

01:35:45.273 --> 01:35:47.875 region:rollup2
POINTED OUT IT DOES FORCE MAY

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:50.011 region:rollup2
NOT LOOK LIKE WOULD USE TO LOOK

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:52.280 region:rollup2
LIKE. BUT THEY CAN STILL BE

01:35:50.011 --> 01:35:54.882 region:rollup2
HEALTHY PRODUCTIVE PROVIDE A

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.050 region:rollup2
WHOLE SET OF BENEFITS AND. MANY

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:58.553 region:rollup2
OF THOSE BENEFITS REALLY ARE

01:35:56.050 --> 01:36:00.288 region:rollup2
ECOLOGICAL RIGHT. HABITAT THEIR

01:35:58.553 --> 01:36:03.691 region:rollup2
THEIR BENEFITS TO OTHER.

01:36:00.288 --> 01:36:04.759 region:rollup2
LIVING ORGANISMS WHEREAS IN

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:06.761 region:rollup2
CITIES WITHOUT.

01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:08.696 region:rollup2
CONTINUED ACTIVE MANAGEMENT

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:10.098 region:rollup2
WITHOUT CONTINUED PLANTING WE

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:12.266 region:rollup2
ARE. PRETTY MUCH GOING TO

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:13.201 region:rollup2
CONTINUE ON A WRONG TRAJECTORY

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:15.136 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT WE KEEP LOSING

01:36:13.201 --> 01:36:16.471 region:rollup2
CANOPY AND THAT'S THE SORT OF

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:18.106 region:rollup2
BIG DIFFERENCE CONCEPTUALLY

01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.540 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:21.042 region:rollup2
NATURAL FORESTS IN OVER FORCE

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:24.078 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR US REALLY BECOME AN

01:36:21.042 --> 01:36:25.580 region:rollup2
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT BY. PEOPLE

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:27.215 region:rollup2
LOCAL.

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:28.549 region:rollup2
CREE MANIFESTLY BENEFIT

01:36:27.215 --> 01:36:30.251 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS UP.

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:31.819 region:rollup2
NATURAL FOREST YOU KNOW YOU

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:33.855 region:rollup2
COULD ACTUALLY REPLANT AND WALK

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:35.590 region:rollup2
AWAY THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU

01:36:33.855 --> 01:36:37.225 region:rollup2
CAN DO IT IN AN URBAN FOREST.

01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:39.427 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING TO KIND OF KEEP

01:36:37.225 --> 01:36:41.729 region:rollup2
IN MIND IS THAT. IN. METAPHORS

01:36:39.427 --> 01:36:42.497 region:rollup2
ARE SELDOM CONVERSION OF TYPE IN

01:36:41.729 --> 01:36:44.198 region:rollup2
OTHER WORDS SOMETHINGTHAT USED

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:46.200 region:rollup2
TO BE A FOREST AGAIN WITH A

01:36:44.198 --> 01:36:48.002 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT OF PROPER MANAGEMENT

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:50.438 region:rollup2
IS LIKELY TO STAY A FOREST.

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:52.440 region:rollup2
IN CITIES AND I THINK WE ALL

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:54.108 region:rollup2
KNOW THIS INTUITIVELY ONCE THE

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.109 region:rollup2
TREES REMOVED THERE'S NO

01:36:54.108 --> 01:36:56.444 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE IT'S GOING TO BE A

01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:57.745 region:rollup2
REPLY BUT RIGHT CAN JUST BE

01:36:56.444 --> 01:36:59.781 region:rollup2
PAVED OVER BECAUSE SOMEBODY

01:36:57.745 --> 01:37:01.883 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO PARK ANOTHER CAR. YOU

01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:02.850 region:rollup2
KNOW I JUST DON'T LIKE THAT TREE

01:37:01.883 --> 01:37:04.218 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO.

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:05.687 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SORT OF BIG

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:07.889 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE I THINK WE WE.

01:37:05.687 --> 01:37:09.891 region:rollup2
WANT TO KIND OF.

01:37:07.889 --> 01:37:10.491 region:rollup2
KEEP OUR FOCUS ON.

01:37:09.891 --> 01:37:12.360 region:rollup2
URBAN TREES SIMPLY BECAUSE IF

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:14.295 region:rollup2
WE.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.463 region:rollup2
TAKE OUR EYES OFF OF THEM REALLY

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:17.432 region:rollup2
THINGS KIND OF GOING IN THE

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:18.833 region:rollup2
WRONG DIRECTION.

01:37:17.432 --> 01:37:20.134 region:rollup2
AND ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:21.936 region:rollup2
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MORTALITY SO

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:23.171 region:rollup2
THE. COLTS WATER OAK BORER THAT

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:25.039 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AND THAT WHILE THE MARIN

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:27.308 region:rollup2
INTERFACE INVASIVE SHUTTLE

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:28.042 region:rollup2
BOARDS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:30.078 region:rollup2
PLACE FROM.

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:32.046 region:rollup2
YES CENTER CITIES ALL THE WAY

01:37:30.078 --> 01:37:34.048 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE WILDLINGS ALL THOSE

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:36.317 region:rollup2
THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:38.186 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WRONG DIRECTION.

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:40.388 region:rollup2
INFANTRY CANOPY

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:40.988 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE SORT OF I WOULD

01:37:40.388 --> 01:37:42.757 region:rollup2
SORT OF THINK OF IT THAT WAY.

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:43.591 region:rollup2
.

01:37:42.757 --> 01:37:45.426 region:rollup2
HELP IS OF COURSE COMPLETELY

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:46.794 region:rollup2
RIGHT TREES  <u><c.green>TREES AND I</c></u>

01:37:45.426 --> 01:37:47.528 region:rollup2
THINK WE IN THIS ROOM ALL WHITE

01:37:46.794 --> 01:37:49.430 region:rollup2
OLD TREES.

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:50.865 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST THAT.

01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:52.033 region:rollup2
SOME TREES ARE HAVING A TOUGHER

01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:54.569 region:rollup2
TIME JUST BY DESIGN AND THOSE

01:37:52.033 --> 01:37:55.103 region:rollup2
ARE THE URBAN TREES.

01:37:54.569 --> 01:37:56.070 region:rollup2
IF I CAN JUMP IN AS WELL I

01:37:55.103 --> 01:37:57.805 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:59.574 region:rollup2
PARTOF WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING

01:37:57.805 --> 01:38:02.810 region:rollup2
IS A SWIFT MOVE FOR MORE

01:37:59.574 --> 01:38:04.912 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT AND. PRACTICES.

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:06.481 region:rollup2
IN FIGHTING FIRES AYE AND AND

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:07.949 region:rollup2
WE HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN TO THE

01:38:06.481 --> 01:38:09.784 region:rollup2
SPACE OF LEVELING OUT

01:38:07.949 --> 01:38:11.319 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION EFFORTS AROUND

01:38:09.784 --> 01:38:13.354 region:rollup2
FORCED ENTRY IS.

01:38:11.319 --> 01:38:15.390 region:rollup2
WHICH IS JUSTICE IN CENTRAL THE

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:16.591 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AND PREPARING AYE FOR

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:18.092 region:rollup2
OUR NEW NORMAL IN TERMS OF

01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:19.861 region:rollup2
CLIMATE IMPACTS THE OTHER THING

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:21.662 region:rollup2
I WOULD MENTION IS. ON FUNDING

01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:23.364 region:rollup2
THE PLANT TREES IS.

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:24.699 region:rollup2
AT HIGHER LEVELS THAN

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:25.666 region:rollup2
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FUNDS

01:38:24.699 --> 01:38:27.535 region:rollup2
FOR TREES.

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:28.803 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO ESPECIALLY AS AS

01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:30.605 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS LIKE CAPITA TRADE BEGAN

01:38:28.803 --> 01:38:33.441 region:rollup2
TO BE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE AND

01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:36.010 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO START MAKING THAT A

01:38:33.441 --> 01:38:36.577 region:rollup2
MORE ELIGIBLE PERCENTAGE OF I'VE

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:39.046 region:rollup2
PROJECT ALLOCATION COSTS SO

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:40.548 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.983 region:rollup2
I IT IT TO BE A HUGE BURDEN FOR

01:38:40.548 --> 01:38:43.918 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO HAVE RUNNING THE

01:38:41.983 --> 01:38:45.686 region:rollup2
PLANT AND THEN TO REALLY

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:48.356 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE TO FIND A FUNDING TO AT

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:50.324 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN AND. AND SUPPORT.

01:38:48.356 --> 01:38:51.959 region:rollup2
THEIR TREES LOCALLY SO I THINK

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:54.796 region:rollup2
WE REALLY HAVE TO START TO THINK

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:57.331 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR

01:38:54.796 --> 01:38:59.200 region:rollup2
PEACE IN THE FORMULA AND I ALSO

01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:00.334 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO. I RESPOND TO

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:03.204 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION CHAIRMAN GARCIA AS

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:04.806 region:rollup2
WELL AROUND THE CLOCK STE WHAT

01:39:03.204 --> 01:39:06.974 region:rollup2
WOULD IT COST TO DO THIS LEVEL

01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:08.776 region:rollup2
OF BRIDES BACK TO SPREAD GREEN

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:10.044 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSFORMATION.

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:12.613 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE GOOD NUMBERS ON

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:14.582 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO HAVE SOME COMMUNITIES

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:17.251 region:rollup2
WHO'VE DONE THEIR OWN LOCAL KIND

01:39:14.582 --> 01:39:18.786 region:rollup2
A NEEDS ASSESSMENT ANALYSIS ON

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:21.255 region:rollup2
THE ONE THAT KIND OF IS ISN'T

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:23.558 region:rollup2
THE MOST RECENT HAS BEEN LA

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:26.060 region:rollup2
COUNTY. WHICH ASSESSED A NEED

01:39:23.558 --> 01:39:29.030 region:rollup2
FOR GREEN SPACE REGIONALLY AT

01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:32.166 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS

01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:35.570 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THE COUNTY OF LA.

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:37.338 region:rollup2
SO. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:39:35.570 --> 01:39:39.307 region:rollup2
WHOLE STATE NEEDS IN TERMS OF

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:40.975 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE PRICE TAG TO REALLY

01:39:39.307 --> 01:39:43.945 region:rollup2
TRANSFORM INFRASTRUCTURE

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:46.614 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE BUT WE DO KNOW THERE

01:39:43.945 --> 01:39:47.748 region:rollup2
ARE SOME LOCALS JURISDICTIONS

01:39:46.614 --> 01:39:51.219 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE DONE SOME OF THAT

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:52.854 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS. AND THAT WAS JUST

01:39:51.219 --> 01:39:55.089 region:rollup2
BASED ON GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:39:52.854 --> 01:39:56.891 region:rollup2
THAT WASN'T BASED ON WATER NEEDS

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:57.525 region:rollup2
ARE SOME OF THE OTHER MULTIPLE

01:39:56.891 --> 01:40:04.365 region:rollup2
BENEFITS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT

01:39:57.525 --> 01:40:06.734 region:rollup2
WILL ASK THAT THOSE WHO

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:07.435 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING. AT TO

THIS PROJECT IS SOMEWHAT

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:06.460 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AS WE HEAD THAT MOST

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:09.764 region:rollup2
OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT

THE NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:41:37.959 --> 01:41:41.295 region:rollup2
WHICH I DISADVANTAGED AND WE ARE

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:42.630 region:rollup2
TREES ARE NEEDED.

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:45.466 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TALKING TO THE

01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:47.301 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TREE RECIPIENTS.

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:50.538 region:rollup2
AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:52.073 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHY THEY NEED TREES.

01:41:50.538 --> 01:41:53.174 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THE

01:41:52.073 --> 01:41:55.042 region:rollup2
TREES AND HOW TO LOCATE THE

01:41:53.174 --> 01:41:56.711 region:rollup2
TREES.

01:47:41.355 --> 01:47:45.326 region:rollup2
PERCENTILE ARE AT THE CALAVERAS

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:46.660 region:rollup2
SCREEN SCORE AND WE WENT AFTER

01:47:45.326 --> 01:47:48.162 region:rollup2
THESE FUNDS BECAUSE AS WAS

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:50.397 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE DEVASTATION OF

01:47:48.162 --> 01:47:52.366 region:rollup2
HAVING. EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO TURN

01:47:50.397 --> 01:47:54.134 region:rollup2
OFF YOUR WATER WITHOUT THINKING

01:47:52.366 --> 01:47:56.270 region:rollup2
OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TREES

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:58.272 region:rollup2
SELF SEVERAL OF OUR URBAN FOREST

01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:59.640 region:rollup2
DIED IMMEDIATELY AND WITH THE

01:47:58.272 --> 01:48:00.474 region:rollup2
DROUGHT COLTON'S UNIQUE WE GET

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.742 region:rollup2
ALL OUR WATER STRAIGHT FROM THE

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:03.610 region:rollup2
GROUND SO WHEN THE DROUGHT

01:48:01.742 --> 01:48:07.047 region:rollup2
OCCURRED ALL OF OUR. MATURE

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:08.916 region:rollup2
TREES THAT HAD DEEP ROOTS DIED.

01:48:07.047 --> 01:48:10.851 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALSO GOT IMPACT DID.

01:48:08.916 --> 01:48:12.820 region:rollup2
AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED FROM A

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:14.421 region:rollup2
LOT OF DISEASE SO THE TREES THAT

01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:16.457 region:rollup2
ARE ALIVE TODAY THEY HAVE A LOT

01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:17.558 region:rollup2
OF.

01:48:16.457 --> 01:48:19.560 region:rollup2
MARK DAMAGED AND.

01:48:17.558 --> 01:48:21.095 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CALLED CLUNK MOLDS ON

01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:22.730 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM OF THE ROOTS.

01:48:21.095 --> 01:48:24.064 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT THEY'RE HAZARDOUS

01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:25.866 region:rollup2
TO OUR RESIDENTS AND THEY HAVE

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:27.368 region:rollup2
TO BE REMOVED SO IT WAS

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:27.868 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GET IN URBAN

01:48:27.368 --> 01:48:29.136 region:rollup2
FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN

01:48:27.868 --> 01:48:31.105 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:48:29.136 --> 01:48:32.639 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN EDUCATE SOME CHANGES

01:48:31.105 --> 01:48:34.074 region:rollup2
ARE ORGAN SAYS SO THAT THERE IS

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:36.243 region:rollup2
A STATE ABILITY OF THAT URBAN

01:48:34.074 --> 01:48:38.278 region:rollup2
FOREST SO THAT IT CONTINUES TO

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:40.080 region:rollup2
SEQUESTER CARBON AND THAT WE CAN

01:48:38.278 --> 01:48:41.782 region:rollup2
HAVE A WHOLE. STOP BUT THE HEAT

01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.284 region:rollup2
ISLAND EFFECT IN OUR CITY WE ARE

01:48:41.782 --> 01:48:45.819 region:rollup2
ONLY AT A SEVEN PERCENT CANOPY.

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:47.221 region:rollup2
BUT WE WILL BE AT A THIRTY

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:49.156 region:rollup2
PERCENT HOPEFULLY IN THE NEXT

01:48:47.221 --> 01:48:50.891 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS JUST BY THAT MASSIVE

01:48:49.156 --> 01:48:52.426 region:rollup2
EFFORT OF TREE PLANTING AND

01:48:50.891 --> 01:48:54.061 region:rollup2
CHANGES IN OUR ORDINANCE SAYS

01:48:52.426 --> 01:48:55.295 region:rollup2
AND JUST WHAT TYPES OF TREES TO

01:48:54.061 --> 01:48:57.231 region:rollup2
PLANT.

01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:58.432 region:rollup2
AND 嫑T

01:48:57.231 --> 01:49:00.534 region:rollup2
OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE

01:48:58.432 --> 01:49:01.435 region:rollup2
WILL NO LONGER PLANT PALM TREES

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:03.670 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

01:49:01.435 --> 01:49:05.406 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT TO ANYBODY

01:49:03.670 --> 01:49:06.740 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT PROVIDE SHADE DROP

01:49:05.406 --> 01:49:08.142 region:rollup2
PROVIDE HABITATS IN THEY'RE NOT

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.143 region:rollup2
CARBON SICK QUESTION. AND

01:49:08.142 --> 01:49:10.277 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN THE CATEGORY AS

01:49:09.143 --> 01:49:12.679 region:rollup2
GRASSES

01:49:10.277 --> 01:49:14.548 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS BEEN AN ENTIRE NEW

01:49:12.679 --> 01:49:16.083 region:rollup2
EDUCATION OUTREACH FOR COMMUNITY

01:49:14.548 --> 01:49:17.684 region:rollup2
IS JUST WHAT TO PLANT AND

01:49:16.083 --> 01:49:19.753 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY YOU NEVER WANNA PLANT

01:49:17.684 --> 01:49:21.121 region:rollup2
SAME TRINA ROWE IN A MEDIAN.

01:49:19.753 --> 01:49:22.322 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:23.824 region:rollup2
ONE THE DISEASE WILL CARRY OUT

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:25.192 region:rollup2
TO THE OTHER AT NEW BOSTON

01:49:23.824 --> 01:49:26.593 region:rollup2
ENTIRE STRING OF TREES.

HAVE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS.

01:49:38.705 --> 01:49:41.675 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO HAVE.

01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:46.013 region:rollup2

PLANET AND PROSPERITY URBAN

02:06:37.657 --> 02:06:40.893 region:rollup2
FORESTRY AND I'VE BEEN READING

02:06:39.225 --> 02:06:42.295 region:rollup2
DO ALL OF THOSE THREE THINGS.

02:06:40.893 --> 02:06:43.796 region:rollup2
AND I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT.

02:06:42.295 --> 02:06:45.631 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:46.599 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IN A LOT OF STATISTICS

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:47.333 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THESE

02:06:46.599 --> 02:06:50.503 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:51.938 region:rollup2
END OF SOBRE SIX BILLION

02:06:50.503 --> 02:06:53.306 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN CAP AND TRADE REVENUE

02:06:51.938 --> 02:06:54.607 region:rollup2
ONLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE

02:06:53.306 --> 02:06:56.209 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN

02:06:54.607 --> 02:06:57.009 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO BOTH OF THESE

02:06:56.209 --> 02:06:59.312 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS COMBINED.

02:06:57.009 --> 02:07:00.613 region:rollup2
SO A LOT OF GREAT BENEFITS FOR

02:06:59.312 --> 02:07:02.715 region:rollup2
NOT A LOT OF FUNDING.

02:07:00.613 --> 02:07:03.916 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO JUST

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:05.184 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH BENEFIT THESE PROGRAMS

02:07:03.916 --> 02:07:08.054 region:rollup2
GENERATE.

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:09.555 region:rollup2
HOW MY KNEE CHO BENEFITS IT DOES

02:07:08.054 --> 02:07:10.890 region:rollup2
HIGH AND HOW THE INVESTMENT IS

02:07:09.555 --> 02:07:12.291 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NOT THAT HIGH?

02:07:10.890 --> 02:07:13.826 region:rollup2
SO THE FACT THAT BOTH OF THESE

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:14.260 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN THE CURRENT PROPOSAL

02:07:13.826 --> 02:07:16.429 region:rollup2
ARE AT ZERO ISRAELI

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:18.064 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE.

02:07:16.429 --> 02:07:19.031 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT ALL OF THESE

02:07:18.064 --> 02:07:21.234 region:rollup2
BENEFITS ARE NOT GONNA CONTINUE

02:07:19.031 --> 02:07:23.002 region:rollup2
TO OCCUR IF WE RELY ON S. B.

02:07:21.234 --> 02:07:24.270 region:rollup2
