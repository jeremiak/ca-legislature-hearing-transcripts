THAT WE CAN DELIVER.

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:54.177
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS BY BEING

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:56.079
TRANSPARENT ON THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:57.447
AND THE CHALLENGES WE FACE.

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:00.650
MAINTAINING OUR COMMITMENTS TO

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:01.885

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:06.957
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE MY REMARKS.

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.592
BY REMINDING YOU THAT THE IDEA

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:09.960
OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.728
CONNECTING THE TWO MOST POPULOUS

00:52:11.795 --> 00:52:13.330
REGIONS OF THE STATE THROUGH THE

00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:14.631
CENTRAL VALLEY IS REALLY

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.132
SIGNIFICANT.

00:52:16.199 --> 00:52:17.434
WHICH IS WHY IT'S BEEN CHAMPION

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.169
BY POLITICAL AND CIVIC LEADERS

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:20.804
AND ADVANCED BY VOTERS.

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:22.072
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IS

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.640
ALREADY CREATED TENS OF

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:26.142
THOUSANDS OF JOBS SUPPORTED

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:36.419
MUCH OF THAT IN THE CENTRAL

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:38.622
VALLEY WORKS BADLY NEEDED.

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:39.789
VOTERS APPROVED THE PROJECT

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:41.625

RAIL SERVICE OVER LANE ON THE

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:24.688
CALTRAIN SERVICE DOES NOT CREATE

00:55:24.754 --> 00:55:26.022
A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT.

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:28.358

AS INDICATED ON THE SLIDE.

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:22.365
THE PROJECT UP A REPORT MOVES

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:25.068
FROM HIGH PROBABILITY TEN TO A

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:27.270

CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

00:58:28.905 --> 00:58:30.373
AND IN DOING SO INCREASES THE

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.774
BUDGET BY ONE POINT EIGHT

00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.009
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:36.312
THIS IS A 17% INCREASE OVER THE

AND THERE ARE THREE MAIN DRIVERS.

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.419
NINE POINT 3% OF THE INCREASE IS

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.054
DUE TO ADDITIONAL CONTINGENCY TO

00:58:45.121 --> 00:58:48.291

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:57.700
THIS TOTALS TO A ONE POINT.

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:58.468
EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.637
DOLLAR INCREASE AND CREATES A

00:59:00.703 --> 00:59:02.372
MORE PRUDENT CONTINGENCY.

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.007

PAUSE FOR REASSESSMENT.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.775
WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO LOOK AT

THE LOWEST COST OPTIONS TO GET

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.778

NOT REACH THE STATE'S POPULATION

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.025
AND THE BENEFITS THEY MAY

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.694
PROVIDE IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:27.729
INQUIRY FOR THIS LEGISLATURE.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:28.897

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:39.908
CAN BE SEEN AS EQUALLY OR MORE

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:42.778
IMPORTANT. FOR EXAMPLE REDUCE

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.046
TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN URBAN

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.113

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.015
RELIEF.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.684
THE MASS OF HOUSING CRISIS MEANS

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.285
LOOKING FOR IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:52.020

AFFORDABLE HOUSING AREAS.

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.557
THE URGENCY OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.125
REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS THE

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:03.966
TRAFFIC.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.734
COULD MEAN THAT URBAN FAST TRAIN

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:07.302
SERVICE MAY PROVIDE GREATER

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:09.771
GREENHOUSE GREAT GAS SAVINGS

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.006

TIMELINE FOR A DELIVERY FOR

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.243
DELIVERY OF A PROJECT SEGMENT IS

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.544
AN IMPORTANT FACTOR.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:16.712
ARE THERE LOCAL SEGMENTS THAT

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:17.946
CAN BE COMPLETED THAT IMPROVE

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:19.648
LOCAL MOBILITY AND REDUCE

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.217
GREENHOUSE GASES SOONER.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:23.886
THESE CONCERNS ARE NOT RIGHT OR

01:15:23.952 --> 01:15:25.954
WRONG THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.155
HOW YOU MEASURE MEASURE A

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:28.824
SITUATION DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU

VIEW IT FROM?

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:33.795

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:58.020
IS THERE A WAY TO MORE

01:15:58.086 --> 01:15:59.688

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.127
IS THERE THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:07.129
PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT IN ANY

01:16:07.195 --> 01:16:08.263
PART OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

CORRIDOR OR CONNECTING CORRIDORS

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.867

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:14.803
INVESTIGATION -- THERE SOME MORE

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:16.405
THINK ABOUT I'LL TRY TO SPEED IT

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:19.207
UP -- POLICY INTEGRATION.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.709
I BELIEVE WE NEED OVERSIGHT

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.411
SYSTEM CAPABLE OF WHAT OF A

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:23.545
WIDER OVERVIEW.

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:24.947
AND I HAVE TO SAY THE TWO

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:27.182
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN STATE RAIL

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:28.550

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:29.451
ACTUALLY DEPARTMENT TO

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:30.686
CONSOLIDATE FUNDING UNDER THE

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.154
REAL PLAN UMBRELLA.

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.989
MAYBE A SPECIAL GUBERNATORIAL

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.390
LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE HOPEFULLY

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:36.625
WITH SOME AUTHORITY.

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.393
THAT CAN BRING HARMONY TO

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.562
COMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVING THAT TOO

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:43.799
OFTEN OCCURS IN ISOLATION --

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.934
WITH A MORE ROBUST A ROBUST RAIL

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:47.636
PLAN GOVERNANCE WITH THIS

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:49.304
LEGISLATURE BE MORE WILLING. TO

01:16:49.371 --> 01:16:51.773
EXPLORE NEW SOURCES OF FUNDING

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.041
FOR LOCAL RAIL FOR HIGH SPEED

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.543
RAIL AND FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.144
CONNECTIVITY IN GENERAL THAT'S

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:57.646
AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:59.982
DON'T WAIT FOR THE FEDS WE NEED

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.683
TO FIND MORE RESOURCES AT HOME.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.986
BUT IT IS CLEAR BECAUSE OF THE

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:04.953
THREATS AND ACTIONS FROM THE

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.254
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:07.823
CHALLENGE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:10.025
RIGHT NOW.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:10.659
THE CHALLENGES ARE GREATER THAN

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:11.760
EVER.

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.228
I DO WANT TO SPECIALLY THANK THE

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:14.763

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.398
IMMEDIATE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:17.666
THAT ACTION.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.201
THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.569

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.604
ENOUGH WITHOUT UNNECESSARY

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:24.272
HURDLES WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:17:24.339 --> 01:17:26.541
NEED TO FIND A COMMON PURPOSE.

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.143
IF WE CONTINUE TO VIEW EACH

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.212
OTHER AS COMPETITORS OR WORSE

01:17:30.278 --> 01:17:32.514
ADVERSARIES BY REGION OR

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.751
RESOURCES.

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:37.419
THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.021
BUT WE WILL BE FAR LESS

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:41.056
SUCCESSFUL BUILDING WHAT WE NEED

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:44.126
A STATEWIDE TRANSIT SYSTEM WITH

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.861
HIGH SPEED RAIL AT ITS CORE.

01:17:45.927 --> 01:17:47.596
SO THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW DO

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:48.730
WE BRING THE MOST VALUE TO

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:50.899
CALIFORNIA IN THE PROCESS OF

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:51.433
BUILDING A HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.968
SYSTEM.

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:54.770
THERE'S A SAYING IN EVERY CRISIS

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:56.238
THERE IS OPPORTUNITY.

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:57.773
IF THE F. R. IN THE PRESIDENT

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.174
WANT TO BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN

01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:00.909
EXPANSION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:03.245
BAKERSFIELD WARMER SAID THAT'S

01:18:03.311 --> 01:18:04.579
ON THEM.

01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:06.081
WE FIGHT BACK WE BUILD THE

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:07.716
CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT AGREED

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.051
UPON WITH THE F. R. A. BUT WE

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.085
ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:11.386
ALTERNATIVES THAT MIGHT BE

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.321
HARDER FOR ANYONE TO MEDDLE WITH.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:14.689
THAT MIGHT GET MORE TRACK ON THE

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:16.158
GROUND AND THE BENEFITS THAT GO

01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:17.526
WITH IT.

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.294
LET'S ADAPT TO CURRENT

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.695

SMALL SOME BIG.

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:24.566
BUT IF THERE'S ANY STATE IN THE

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.368
UNION CAPABLE OF BUILDING FOR

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:28.103
THE FUTURE CAPABLE OF TURNING

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.505
MILLIONS OF VOICES INTO ONE

PROJECT UPDATE REPORT INCLUDES

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:41.142
THAT CLEAR DISCUSSION OF THAT

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:44.612
RISK -- ON THURSDAY OF LAST WEEK

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.147
A LETTER WAS RECEIVED FROM THE

THERE IS NO.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.976
RELATIONSHIP OR A WORKING

FEDERAL AUTHORITY AND DIES AT

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.248
LAST.

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:21.516
AND I'M NOT GOING TO PROJECT

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:24.986
WHAT THAT WHY THAT HAS OCCURRED

01:30:25.052 --> 01:30:27.221
BUT IT DOESN'T EXIST CORRECT

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:27.522
[inaudible]

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:28.422
THAT IS.

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:30.057
NO DOUBT A CHALLENGE TO THE

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:32.426
PROJECT -- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.962
DISENGAGED IN SEVERAL WAYS --

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:37.398
THE FUNDING ISSUE DO YOU REYES

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:38.699
BUT IN ADDITIONAL A SOME OF THE

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.101
PARTICIPATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:42.837
DOCUMENTS IS ADDITIONALLY A RISK --

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.972
THE SEGMENT UNDER CONSTRUCTION

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:46.674
NOW THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:47.909
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT DOES

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.378
HAVE CLEARED ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:52.213
BUT FOR THE EXTENSIONS -- THAT'S

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.515
CLEARLY AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO

01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:56.150
FEDERAL PARTICIPATION THROUGH

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.752
THAT SO YOU AND I ARE SAYING THE

01:30:57.819 --> 01:30:59.020
EXACT SAME THING.

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:00.822
I LIVE IN BAKERSFIELD I'M

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:02.123
PROBABLY THE ONLY MEMBER HERE

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:02.957
THAT REPRESENTS THE CENTER

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:03.724
VALLEY.

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:05.593
I SEE THE IMPACT OF THIS THIS

01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:06.561
PROJECT.

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:08.029
IN MY COMMUNITY.

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:10.264
I DRIVE PASSAGE EVERY SINGLE

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:11.365
WEEK.

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.734
SO HOW IS THIS REPORT CREDIBLE

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.870
NOW THAT WE BOTH AGREED THAT THE

01:31:15.937 --> 01:31:19.040
GLARING HOLES EXIST.

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:20.842
WELL AGAIN SIR RIGHT I BELIEVE

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:22.376
THIS REPORT IS FULLY CREDIBLE

01:31:22.443 --> 01:31:23.911
BECAUSE WE'RE TRANSPARENTLY

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:26.414
SIDING ON THESE RISK AND CITING

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:28.149
WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON TOO MANY

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.685
WE CAN REPEAT THE RISKS.

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:33.955
THE REST A REAL RIGHT.

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.456
YOU INDICATING THIS REPORT THAT

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:36.757
YOU HAVE TWENTY POINT FOUR

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:38.359
BILLION DOLLARS TO FINISH A

01:31:38.426 --> 01:31:39.994
SEGMENT THAT COST TWENTY POINT

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:41.662
FOUR BILLION.

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.865
NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.233
HAS SAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:46.701
TRY TO TAKE BACK OR ARE TAKING

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:49.003
BACK NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:50.304
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:52.540
SO YOU HAVE A WHOLE AT A MINIMUM

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.909
WITHOUT ANY COST OVERRUNS OF

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:55.776
NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT

01:31:55.843 --> 01:31:57.778
MILLION DOLLARS SO HOW DO YOU

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.447
MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE.

01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:01.048
WHAT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:03.918
DOES HARM IN TRYING TO PULL BACK

01:32:03.985 --> 01:32:05.419
THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN GRANTED

01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:06.721
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.155
THAT NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:09.624
MILLION.

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.459
IS HARMFUL TO THIS TO THIS

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:24.498
YOU HAVE MONEY TO BIXEL BUT I

01:38:24.565 --> 01:38:26.667

MERCED BIXEL HOW DO YOU GET THAT

01:38:29.937 --> 01:38:30.771
FIVE FOLD INCREASE.

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:32.606
WHAT WAS MODELED WAS THE HIGH

01:38:32.673 --> 01:38:34.842
SPEED RAIL SERVICE A RUNNING

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.510
TRAINS ABOUT EVERY HOUR?

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:38.846
AND CONNECTING TO SAN JOAQUIN'S

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:41.115
AN ACE IN MERCED AND LOOKING AT

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:42.950
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.652
OF THOSE OF THOSE -- THE

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.854
SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRATED --

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.356
TOGETHER AND THAT'S HOW THE THE

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:50.758
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS WERE

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:52.126
CALCULATED.

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:54.028
IN YOU THE A FIVE FOLD INCREASE

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:55.296
IS REALISTIC.

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:57.097
WHAT'S A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN

01:38:57.164 --> 01:38:59.867
THE SERVICE.

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:01.802
SO YES -- THESE -- MODELING

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:05.306
NUMBERS -- WERE BASED ON AT THE

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:07.274
ANALYSIS USE FOR THE STATE RAIL

01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:10.744
PLAN -- SO -- WE STAND BESIDE

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:12.413
THESE THESE ESTIMATES.

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:14.114

HE'S CLEARLY -- I BELIEVE

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:28.696
JUSTIFIED BECAUSE I THINK

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:30.798
CALIFORNIANS ARE GROWING WEARY

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:32.666
AND THEY'RE GOING MORE UPSET.

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:34.268
THEY THEY THIS PROJECT IS AS I

01:39:34.335 --> 01:39:35.602
SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT WAY

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.471
OFF TRACK THE THE HOLES ARE

01:39:37.538 --> 01:39:38.706
GETTING LARGER.

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:40.007
NOW THE DELAYS ARE GETTING

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:42.042
LARGER TO COST OVERRUNS CONTINUE

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:44.078
TO PROCESS THEY'RE STILL -- FOR

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:45.479
FEDERAL FUNDS THAT NO LONGER

THAT THEY'RE THERE FOR A FUNDS

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.915
NOW THAT NO LONGER EXIST.

01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:50.517
AND SO I MEAN IF WE'RE REALLY

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:53.287
GOING TO BE SERIOUS AS AS A BODY

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:55.689
AS BUSINESS THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:57.024
TO BE STEWARDS OF THE TAX DOLLAR

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:58.258
THIS PROJECT HAS TO BE

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.259
REEVALUATED.

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:00.461
AND I THINK AT LEAST AT A

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:01.362

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.403
IT'S IT'S STATES VERY CLEARLY --

01:40:42.469 --> 01:40:44.004
THE THE PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE ALL

01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:45.506
THE FUNDING NEEDED TO COMPLETE

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.307
THE ENTIRE PROJECTS STATE WIDE

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.675
AND IT NEVER HAS.

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:49.977
IT POINTS THAT'S A QUOTE IT

01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:51.779
POINTS OUT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:52.713
THE PROP ONE A PAWN MEASURE

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.482
PASSED WHICH PROVIDED 420% OF

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:56.750
THE PROJECTS THAN ESTIMATED

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.385
COSTS WHICH WILL NOW HAVE

01:40:58.452 --> 01:40:59.386
INCREASED SENSE.

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:01.388
I BELIEVE THE CONTEMPLATION AT

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:02.656
THE TIME WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.258
PRIVATE INVESTMENT IT WOULD BE

01:41:04.324 --> 01:41:05.826
SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL INVESTMENT

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:08.228
AND THEN THE PROP TWENTY BONDS

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:08.462
WOULD.

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:09.596
WOULD MATCH.

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:11.298
AS WELL SO THAT THERE WAS SORT

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:12.766
OF THREE FUNDING SOURCES TO GET

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:13.967
THE PROJECT COMPLETED.

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.702
I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE NOT IN THE

THAT.

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:22.142
BUT THAT'S MY RECOLLECTION FROM

TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH A STABLE

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:29.716
JOB WHAT WE CALL GHG OUR FUNDS A

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:32.386
PROGRAM THROUGH.

TWENTY THIRTY PLUS FEDERAL FUNDS

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:35.889
PLUS PROP ONE A FUNDING THE

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:37.691
AUTHORITY HAS ACCESS TO JUST

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:39.293
UNDER 30%.

01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:40.994
OF TODAY'S ESTIMATED PROJECT

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.763
COST SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL A

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:43.997

QUESTION MY CONSTITUENTS ASK ME.

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:48.869
ALL THE TIME.

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.370
HOW IS THIS THING GOING TO BE

01:41:50.437 --> 01:41:53.073
COMPLETED WHERE'S THE OTHER 70%

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.374
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE FEDS ARE

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:55.642
TRYING TO CLAW BACK MONEY I GET

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.144
THERE'S A LAWSUIT OVER?

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.480
SO THAT'S OUTCOME UNCERTAIN -- I

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:00.714
BELIEVE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:02.249
BUT THAT THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:04.151

MENTION LIKE THE INTERSTATE

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:31.111
HIGHWAY SYSTEM AS AN EXAMPLE --

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:32.846

SEGMENTS BEFORE THE ENTIRETY OF

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:43.557
THE SYSTEM IS BUILT OUT -- SO IS

01:42:43.624 --> 01:42:47.094
INDICATED HERE -- THE WITH A CAP

THIRTY THAT STE ENDS UP BEING

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.402
ABOUT 30% OF THE OVERALL PROJECT

COST -- WITH THAT FUNDING WE

01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:00.007
BELIEVE AS AS ONE OF THE SLIDES

01:43:00.073 --> 01:43:01.341
I GUESS THE SLIDE THAT STILL UP

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.876
THERE ARE ARTICULATE AND THEIR

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:04.211
SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THE

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:05.178
SYSTEM.

01:43:05.245 --> 01:43:06.413
I HAVING.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.948
UPON DELIVERING SOME OF THOSE

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:11.919
BENEFITS -- BELIEVES THE THE

01:43:11.985 --> 01:43:14.021
BENEFIT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL WILL

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.757
WILL BE DEMONSTRATED CLEARLY --

01:43:16.823 --> 01:43:18.992
ALSO -- AS YOU SAY AT THE

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:20.894
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- HAD ABOUT

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:22.896
A TWO YEAR PERIOD OF FIVE

01:43:22.963 --> 01:43:24.464
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN HIGH

01:43:24.531 --> 01:43:25.566
SPEED RAIL NOT JUST IN

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:26.833
CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.469
COUNTRY -- THAT'S TWO THOUSAND

01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:30.871
IT WITH THE OUR FUNDS AND THEN

01:43:30.938 --> 01:43:32.606
THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY

01:43:32.673 --> 01:43:34.074
TEN SINCE THEN THEY HAVE NOT

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:36.677
COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT NEW MONEY --

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:37.978
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL ANYWHERE IN

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.746
THE IN THE COUNTRY BUT OTHER

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:44.351
STATES ARE ALSO PURSUING HIGH

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.485
SOME POINT THE FEDERAL

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:46.853
GOVERNMENT WILL COME BACK.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.488
AND BE A FUNDING PARTNER WITH

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:51.491
NEW MONEY. FOR THE SYSTEM AND IN

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:53.927
TERMS OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR --

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:56.330
COURSE THEY LOOK -- TO DE RISCO

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:59.032
PROJECTS AND SO -- THEY'VE BEEN

01:43:59.099 --> 01:44:01.335
ENVISIONED AS A PART OF THE

01:44:01.401 --> 01:44:03.837
LATER -- FUNDING PARTNERS --

01:44:03.904 --> 01:44:05.706
THERE ALSO -- I THINK LOOKING

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:08.775
FOR A DEMONSTRATION OF THE

01:44:08.842 --> 01:44:10.143
BENEFIT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THAT

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.044
WILL BE DEMONSTRATED BY

01:44:11.111 --> 01:44:12.980
RIDERSHIP AND OTHER FACTORS WE

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:17.417
WERE ABLE TO GET INITIAL SERVICE

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:17.985
UP AND RUNNING.

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:18.785
OKAY MY NEXT QUESTION IS IS

01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:20.187
THERE ARE PRESENTLY A VIABLE

01:44:20.253 --> 01:44:22.422
PLAN TO CONNECT.

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:23.056
I GUESS WHAT WOULD BE

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:24.891
BAKERSFIELD THE SOUTHERNMOST

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.493
POINT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:29.496
STATEMENT. TO DOWNTOWN LOS

01:44:29.563 --> 01:44:30.864
ANGELES OR SOMEWHERE.

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:32.499
DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND WHAT

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.267
WOULD THAT PLAN ENTAILS BECAUSE

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:35.335
IT SEEMS TO ME AND I'VE DRIVEN

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:37.738
THE GRAPEVINE ON I FIVE MANY

01:44:37.804 --> 01:44:39.940
MANY TIMES -- THAT'S A

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:42.175
CHALLENGING THING. TO GET TO GET

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:43.944
RAIL SYSTEM EITHER OVER UNDER

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.812
AROUND THAT SEEMS LIKE THAT

01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:47.514
WOULD BE QUITE A CHALLENGE.

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:48.882
AND I I'M NOT.

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:50.217
TRYING TO HOLD YOU GUYS ANYTHING

01:44:50.283 --> 01:44:51.618
I GET THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:53.720
THIS BUT IS THERE PRESENTLY A

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:55.622
VIABLE PLAN TO CONNECT

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:57.190
BAKERSFIELD TO LOS ANGELES.

01:44:57.257 --> 01:44:58.659
WELL THAT DOES -- I THINK

01:44:58.725 --> 01:45:00.327
ACTUALLY TWO SEGMENTS THAT ARE

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:01.428
UNDERGOING THE ENVIRONMENTAL

SAY DO A BUS CONNECTION FROM LOS

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:32.726
ANGELES THAN CONNECTING

01:45:32.793 --> 01:45:33.560
BAKERSFIELD.

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:34.895

01:46:01.722 --> 01:46:03.690
I THINK AT HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:06.193
PROVIDES -- YOU KNOW BUSES ARE

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:06.827

THERE ARE YOU NEED TO DO THAT

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:11.431
FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL INVESTMENT --

01:46:11.498 --> 01:46:13.333
FROM BAKERSFIELD LINKING TO PALM

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.669

LOS ANGELES AREA -- WOULD YOU

01:46:17.437 --> 01:46:18.605
AGREE THAT THAT.

TOLD THE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:28.815

IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THAT'S

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:34.855
CORRECT YEAH AND THE SYSTEM AS

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.022
IT'S BEING BUILT IN BUILDING

01:46:36.089 --> 01:46:38.358
BLOCKS IS DESIGNED TO MEET THOSE

01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.460

FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

OFFERING UP.

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:56.710
UPDATE -- BUT GIVEN ONE OF THE

01:46:56.777 --> 01:46:57.711
QUESTION OF THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:46:57.778 --> 01:46:59.012
OF ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WAS

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:00.180
ASKING.

01:47:00.247 --> 01:47:01.648
I THINK SOMEONE OF THE SIMPLE

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:03.483
RESPONSES WOULD BE -- TO

01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:04.618
DEMONSTRATE HOW MUCH MONEY HAS

01:47:04.684 --> 01:47:05.919
BEEN SPENT SO FAR AND THE

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:07.220
CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:47:07.287 --> 01:47:09.923
AND HOW MANY JOBS HAVE BEEN

01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:11.591
CREATED BECAUSE OF THAT AS A

01:47:11.658 --> 01:47:13.126
SMALL PART OF THIS WHOLE THING.

01:47:13.193 --> 01:47:14.728
BUT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S OF KEY

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:17.697
POINT THAT -- IN THE QUESTION

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:19.065
AND ANSWER.

01:47:19.132 --> 01:47:21.468
IT WAS NOT ADDRESSED ANDWHAT

BENEFITS HAVE BEEN DERIVED

01:47:22.903 --> 01:47:26.206
LOCALLY -- AND ALSO TO POINT OUT

01:47:26.273 --> 01:47:29.142
HOW MANY OF THOSE JOBS --

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:30.944
EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS WERE LOCAL

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.679
FORCES INDIVIDUALS ARE EXPERTS

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.414
COMING IN FROM.

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:36.850

NOT NOW BUT LATER ON PROVIDING

01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.621
THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I THINK

01:47:41.688 --> 01:47:42.455
THAT.

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:44.691
IS A GREAT DEAL OF BENEFIT THAT

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:46.059
MANY OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE WOULD

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:49.596
HAVE BEEN -- PLEASED TO HAVE

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:51.898
RECEIVED IN THEIR DISTRICTS --

01:47:51.965 --> 01:47:54.201
THAT'S ONE COMMENT WAS MADE A

01:47:54.267 --> 01:47:56.803
LITTLE WHILE AGO ABOUT OVERSIGHT

01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:58.438
A PLEA BY MR CURTAIN.

I WANTED.

01:48:00.674 --> 01:48:02.242
TO KNOW WHAT IN A PERFECT.

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.444
WORLD SCENARIO THAT OVERSIGHT

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:06.446
PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE AND AND

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.481
MISTER CHAIRMAN HAVE YOU OTHER

01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:10.817
QUESTIONS ON FOLLOWING UP SO --

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:11.885
BECAUSE WE'VE OVERSIGHT IS A

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:12.752
WRESTLING IN A PERFECT WORLD

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:14.588
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE I HAVE

01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:15.488
NO IDEA.

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:16.590
THEY'LL NEVER BE SUCH A MISTER

01:48:16.656 --> 01:48:17.958
CURTAINS WORLD YEAH WELL MY

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.125
MISTER CURTAINS WORLD WOULD BE

01:48:19.192 --> 01:48:21.127
THE ABILITY TO SOMEHOW OVERCOME

01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:22.629
THE SILOS THAT.

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:24.598
EVERYBODY OPERATES IN AND IT'S

01:48:24.664 --> 01:48:25.999
JUST YOU MAY NATURE.

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:28.068
IF THERE'S A WAY TO HAVE A BODY

01:48:28.134 --> 01:48:30.804
THAT OVERSEES THE WHOLE PROCESS

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.606
SO THAT YOU INTEGRATE FUNDS IN A

01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:34.741
WAY THAT MAKES SENSE -- SO THAT

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:36.309
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS CAN INTEGRATE

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:37.544
TOGETHER IT'S VERY HARD

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:39.579
INDEPENDENTLY -- NOBODY WANTS

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:41.448
PUT THEIR CARDS ON THE TABLE SO

01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:42.749
YOU NEED A AND AND THE REAL

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.951
PLANTS A GOOD START -- YOU KNOW

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:46.253
MY THINKING HERE AND I BELIEVE

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:48.054
THE BOARD SHOWS SOME INTEREST IN

01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:49.556
EXPRESSING THIS AND I DON'T WANT

01:48:49.623 --> 01:48:51.091
TO SPEAK TO FOR A LINE FOR THE

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:53.260
BOARD BUT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:54.561
THE POTENTIAL FOR MATCHING MONEY

01:48:54.628 --> 01:48:55.695
WHEN WE ARE ADAPTING TO THE

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:57.430
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:58.999
AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO I

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:00.066
THINK SOME OF THE POINTS MADE

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:01.601
ABOUT THE MONEY IS ARE GOING TO

01:49:01.668 --> 01:49:02.936
BE DEALT WITH AS THE

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:04.537
CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOW.

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:06.539
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK OUTSIDE AND

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:07.841
SEE IF THERE'S PRIVATE MATCHING

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:09.643
MONEY OR PUBLIC MATCH I MEAN A

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:12.345
LOCAL MATCHING MONEY -- I KNOW

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:14.047
THERE ARE IS A PRIVATE.

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:21.888
TRAIN BEING DISCUSSED FROM VEGAS.

01:49:21.955 --> 01:49:22.422
TO VICTORVILLE PALMDALE.

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:23.089
THAT'S POSSIBLE PRIVATE MONEY IN

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:24.090
THE IN THE LINKAGE TO OUR TRAIN

01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:25.625
BUT ALL OF THESE LOCAL

01:49:25.692 --> 01:49:26.993
TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.361
MONEY IF THEY WOULD IF WE WOULD

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:30.096
GET MATCHING MONEY SO THAT MIGHT

01:49:30.163 --> 01:49:31.364
MAKE OUR MONEY GO FURTHER.

01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:34.467
THIS IS WHAT WE DO WE ADAPT

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:34.768
[inaudible]

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:35.936
SO.

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:37.270
RAY ARE AT A COUPLE THINGS THAT

01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:38.805
THE QUESTIONS FIRST ON WE

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:39.372
DEFINITELY WILL GET YOU THE

01:49:39.439 --> 01:49:41.308
NUMBERS ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT

01:49:41.374 --> 01:49:42.809
BUT JUST TO GIVE A SENSE OF THAT.

01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:46.279
BETWEEN JULY SEVENTEEN IN JUNE.

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:48.548
TWENTY EIGHTEEN ABOUT 18% OF THE

01:49:48.615 --> 01:49:49.649
FOURTEEN THOUSAND JOBS THAT WERE

01:49:49.716 --> 01:49:51.084
CREATED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:52.452
FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:49:52.519 --> 01:49:55.088
AND IN FRESNO COUNTY.

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:57.624
ABOUT ROUGHLY 50% OF THE TOTAL

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:58.625
JOBS ADDED DURING THAT TIME

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:00.593
PERIOD WEREFROM HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:02.729
ONE AND 30% OF THOSE DIRECT FROM

01:50:02.796 --> 01:50:04.030
DIRECT EMPLOYMENT BY THE HIGH

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:05.131
SPEED RAIL PROJECT SO IT'S A

01:50:05.198 --> 01:50:06.366
SUBSTANTIAL.

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:08.001
ECONOMIC IMPACT AND WE DO HAVE

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:09.436
ALL THOSE NUMBERS BROKE DOWN AS

01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:12.005
WELL AS A HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE

01:50:12.072 --> 01:50:13.340
IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:14.774
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT CENTERS

01:50:14.841 --> 01:50:16.576

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.411
AND THEN ARE ON OVERSIGHT I VIEW

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:20.413
THIS AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.349
PART OF THE ROLE BOTH OF THE

01:50:22.415 --> 01:50:24.184
HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY BOARD.

01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:25.885
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ASKING

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.120
THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT SORT OF

01:50:27.187 --> 01:50:28.154
FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:29.255
REVIEW AND ALL THAT AND VERY

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:30.390
TRANSPARENT WAY.

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:31.992
AND IT'S ALSO OBVIOUSLY -- THE

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.626
LEGISLATURE'S ROLE AS WELL TO

01:50:33.693 --> 01:50:34.995
PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT TO MAKE

01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:36.963
SURE THAT WE CAN BUILD

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.531
CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE.

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:40.400
DISPLAYING AS TRANSPARENTLY AS

01:50:40.467 --> 01:50:42.402
WE CAN WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT THE

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:43.737
RISKS ARE WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT

01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:44.838
THAT THAT'S HOW YOU REBUILD

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.006
CONFIDENCE SO.

01:50:46.072 --> 01:50:46.873
WHILE SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.408
ARE NOT THE MOST ONE WANTS TO

01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:52.379
ANSWER THAT'S WHAT OUR JOBS ARE

01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:52.912
SO WE APPRECIATE THE HARD

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:54.447
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

01:50:54.514 --> 01:50:57.684
SO. TWO THINGS -- FIRST OF ALL I

01:50:57.751 --> 01:50:58.618
I DO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

01:50:58.685 --> 01:50:59.986
SAYING BUT PART OF THE CHALLENGE

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.388
AND PART OF THE FRUSTRATION I'VE

01:51:01.454 --> 01:51:03.289
HAD BEING HERE.

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:07.060
IS THAT -- OF UNDER.

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:10.363
GOVERNOR BROWN THERE WAS A

FOCUSED ATTEMPT TO BRING A LOT

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:14.467
OF THE RESOURCES.

01:51:14.534 --> 01:51:16.236
THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:17.871
AND PUSH THAT FORWARD.

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.572
A LOT OF IT SOME OF IT ALSO

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:20.640
BEING CONTINGENT ON FEDERAL

01:51:20.707 --> 01:51:22.275
FUNDS THAT WERE GOING TO BE MADE

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:23.043
AVAILABLE [inaudible]

01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:27.914
OF INSTEAD OF INSTEAD OF

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:29.649
CHALLENGING SOMETHING THAT WILL

01:51:29.716 --> 01:51:30.750
ALSO GO THERE BECAUSE THE

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:31.951
GOVERNOR WILL.

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:34.954
PUSH FOR THAT. FOR THAT'S FOR

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:36.122
FOR WHAT HE WANTED TO DO

01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:39.826
ACCOMPLISH -- I THINK I CAN

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:41.194
SPEAK FOR MYSELF BUT I'M SURE

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:43.396
SOME OF US.

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.365
HERE'S WHAT WENT ALONG WITH THAT

01:51:45.432 --> 01:51:47.834
EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD HAVE SEEN.

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:49.936
THE FIRST SEGMENT OF THE PROJECT

01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:51.938
BE IN A DENSER SETTING.

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.173
WHERE WE COULD DEMONSTRATE THE

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:56.443
NUMBERS BASED ON THE USAGE?

01:51:56.509 --> 01:51:58.178
IF THIS PROJECT STARTED IN

01:51:58.244 --> 01:52:00.213
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.815
SPECIFICALLY FROM LET'S SAY

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.917
BAKERSFIELD OR EVEN PALMDALE

01:52:03.983 --> 01:52:05.885
LANCASTER DOWN.

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:07.353
TO LOS ANGELES AN THEN ANAHEIM

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.022
BURBANK LOS ANGELES AND ANAHEIM

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:10.690
BUT THAT TIME BURBANK WASN'T

01:52:10.757 --> 01:52:12.659
REALLY BEING DISCUSSED BUT

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:16.729
BURBANK LOS ANGELES IN ANAHEIM --

01:52:16.796 --> 01:52:19.866
THE THE TURN AROUND ON THE

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.601
LESSENING OF THE IMPACT WOULD BE

01:52:21.668 --> 01:52:23.670
SO SIGNIFICANT.

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:24.370
THAT I THINK THE REST OF THE

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:25.772
PROJECT WOULDN'T.

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:27.207
HAVE AS MUCH.

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:28.408
CHALLENGE.

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:29.709
MAYBE IT'S JUST WISHFUL THINKING

01:52:29.776 --> 01:52:32.078
ON MY PART BUT I THINK WHEN YOU

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:35.115
SEE START SEEING THE TRAFFIC.

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:37.450
OF WHITE LIGHTS SOUTH HEADED

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:40.286
SOUTHBOUND ON THE FIVE FREEWAY

01:52:40.353 --> 01:52:41.955
STARTING AT ABOUT FOUR THIRTY IN

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:46.326
THE MORNING -- IT'S ALSO VERY

01:52:46.392 --> 01:52:49.395
EASY TO SEE HOW -- HOUSING IS

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:51.498
IMPACTED BY TRANSPORTATION.

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:52.665
AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE COULD HAVE

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:54.868
HIT TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE BUT

01:52:54.934 --> 01:52:55.768
DON'T WANNA.

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:57.070
CONTINUE DOING A MONOLOGUE ON

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:58.538
THAT.

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.140
BUT I'M JUST STRESSING THE

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:02.375
IMPORTANCE OF I THINK.

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.110
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS?

01:53:04.177 --> 01:53:04.777
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:06.579
INVESTMENTS AND THE FOCUS IN

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:10.116
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- IS MADE

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:11.351
TO THAT EXTENT WHEN.

01:53:11.417 --> 01:53:12.852
MATCHING FUNDS ARE BEING

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:14.420
DISCUSSED.

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:15.889
WHAT EXACTLY ABOUT LOCAL

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:18.191
MATCHING FUNDS LA HAS PASSED ITS

01:53:18.258 --> 01:53:21.027
MEASURE THIS SB ONE FUNDING

01:53:21.094 --> 01:53:25.765
AVAILABLE -- I AM NOT LOOKING AS

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:26.966
MATCHING FUNDS.

01:53:27.033 --> 01:53:28.268
I'M NOT INTERPRETING MATCHING

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:29.335
FUNDS TO BE.

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:32.405
PRIVATE FUNDS [inaudible]

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:35.141
SO PLEASE.

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.477
THAT THEY COULD BE IF A PRIVATE

01:53:37.544 --> 01:53:38.711
SECTOR HAVE INTEREST IN THAT

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:40.413
PARTICULAR RAIL LINE AND THEY

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.981
COULD FIND A WAY TO EITHER

01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:43.583
OPERATOR TO HELP BUILD IT.

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:45.285
BUT THE MATCHING FUNDS I MEAN

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:46.786
SPECIFICALLY.

01:53:46.853 --> 01:53:49.322
THERE'S LOTS OF PROJECTS GOING

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:51.057
ON BURBANK AIRPORT IS RE.

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:52.559
POSITIONING ITS TERMINALS THEY

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:53.760
HAVE MONEY FOR THAT WE HAVE

01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:56.796
PLANS FOR THE BURBANK AIRPORT

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:58.031
FOR POTENTIAL STATION THERE.

01:53:58.097 --> 01:53:59.866
THOSE FUNDS PUT TOGETHER COULD

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:01.768
GET THAT DONE AND I DON'T KNOW

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:03.203
IN WHAT TIME LINE I DON'T KNOW

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:05.071
WITH THE DISCUSSIONS ARE AND I'M

01:54:05.138 --> 01:54:06.673
WE LET BRIAN DEAL WITH THAT.

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:07.807
THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF MATCHING

01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:10.076
FUNDS WITH BOTH ELEMENTS OR

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:12.011
THREE OR FOUR EIGHT ELEMENTS

01:54:12.078 --> 01:54:14.347
METROLINK HAS COUNTIES HAS ALL

01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:15.715
KINDS OF MONEY.

01:54:15.782 --> 01:54:16.883
AND WE COULD CONTRIBUTE IN THE

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:20.386
SENSE THAT IT IMPROVES THE

01:54:20.453 --> 01:54:22.488
ABILITY FOR US TO GET TRACK.

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:23.656
HIGH SPEED TRACK OR URBAN HIGH

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:25.124
SPEED TRACK.

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:25.959
THAT'S THE CONCEPT OF MATCHING

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:28.061
FUNDS THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENED

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:28.661
MATCHING FUNDS IN THE VALLEY

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:30.196
HAVE HAPPENED AS WITH FEDERAL

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.064
FUNDS.

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.865
THERE'S NOT MORE NOW I BELIEVE

01:54:32.932 --> 01:54:33.866
THERE'S NO MORE MATCHING AT THE

01:54:33.933 --> 01:54:36.769
LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT'S THAT'S A

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:37.270
THAT'S IN QUESTION IT'S

01:54:37.337 --> 01:54:38.404
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:40.440
AND I AND I DO THINK AS WE ARE

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.141
ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:44.110
DELIVER THERE WILL BE INCREASING

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:45.878
INTEREST FROM PRIVATE SECTOR

01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:46.913
INVESTING BOTH BECAUSE ARE SHOWN

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:48.348
WE CAN DELIVER.

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:49.782
AND SOME OF THE RISKS OF LOWER

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:50.416
WHEN YOU CLEAR THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:54:50.483 --> 01:54:52.218
WORK MAKES IT MUCH MORE

01:54:52.285 --> 01:54:53.419
ATTRACTIVE FOR PRIVATE PARKING

01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:54.554
PARTICIPATE.

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:55.588
AS OPPOSED TO THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:56.990
COME IN AND EARLY STAGE WHERE

01:54:57.056 --> 01:54:58.124
THEY HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF THAT

01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.325
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK.

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:01.628
SO WE ARE WE BELIEVE THIS

01:55:01.694 --> 01:55:03.730
PROJECT OVER TIME. TO BE ABLE TO

01:55:03.796 --> 01:55:07.066
BE MEETING ITS FULL POTENTIAL

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:08.101
WILL REQUIRE.

01:55:08.167 --> 01:55:09.269
FUNDING PARTNERS FROM THE

01:55:09.335 --> 01:55:10.903
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVERY MAJOR

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:12.305
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT HAS AND

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:13.506
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:14.507
UNDER INVESTING IN

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:16.242
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR YEARS NOT

01:55:16.309 --> 01:55:18.578
JUST RAIL.

01:55:18.645 --> 01:55:19.679
AND IT ALSO REQUIRE.

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:21.180
PARTNERS BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:22.548
WITH THE END WITH THE PRIVATE

01:55:22.615 --> 01:55:24.017
SECTOR AND WE FULLY EXPECT THAT

01:55:24.083 --> 01:55:25.752
THOSE WILL COME AS WE SHOW THAT

01:55:25.818 --> 01:55:27.720
WE CAN DELIVER.

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:29.789
SO GOING BACK TO THE BURBANK

01:55:29.856 --> 01:55:31.691
AIRPORT THAT'S A WONDERFUL

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:33.293
OPPORTUNITY WHAT WHAT

01:55:33.359 --> 01:55:35.295
CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN HAD SO

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:35.862
FAR.

01:55:35.928 --> 01:55:37.263
AND I THINK I SEE MISTER FOR

01:55:37.330 --> 01:55:38.665
WASHINGTON IN THE AUDIENCE AS

01:55:38.731 --> 01:55:39.766
WELL SO I DON'T KNOW AT SOME

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:40.867
POINT IF HE WAS.

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:42.168
GONNA BE SPEAKING TO SOME OF

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:43.703
THESE ISSUES AS WELL BECAUSE I

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:45.204
THINK THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:46.472
OPPORTUNITY.

01:55:46.539 --> 01:55:48.708
TO CONNECTS AND FERNANDO VALLEY

01:55:48.775 --> 01:55:50.410
TO PASADENA AS WELL.

01:55:50.476 --> 01:55:53.012
BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC --

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:54.514
WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THING

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:55.615
WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE

01:55:55.682 --> 01:55:57.183
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN

01:55:57.250 --> 01:56:00.253
PLACE? TO COMPLY I DO NOT KNOW

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:01.587
SURE HE HAD NOT TRYING TO

01:56:01.654 --> 01:56:04.057
BURBANK AIRPORT SPECIFICALLY I

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.958
DID WANT TO ADD THOUGH THAT --

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:08.027
TERMS AND MATCHING FUNDS -- THE

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:10.396
PROP ONE NAY DOES REQUIRE A 50%

01:56:10.463 --> 01:56:13.333
MATCH -- WONDER ONE MATCH FROM

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:14.901
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SO WHERE

01:56:14.967 --> 01:56:16.235
BOOK IN FUNDS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:56:16.302 --> 01:56:18.371
INVEST IN THE CALTRAIN A SYSTEM

01:56:18.438 --> 01:56:19.972
OR IN UNION STATION.

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:21.307
OTHER FUNDS HAVE MATCH THOSE

01:56:21.374 --> 01:56:22.608
DOLLARS.

01:56:22.675 --> 01:56:25.411
SO IN CALTRANS CASES OTHER LOCAL

01:56:25.478 --> 01:56:27.146
FIND SAYS STATE FUNDS THAT HAVE

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:28.848
BEEN BROUGHT TO MATCH THE ONE A

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:30.016
FUNDS AND THAT'S THE SAME WITH

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.884
THAT ROSECRANS MARQUARDT PROJECT

01:56:31.951 --> 01:56:34.354
IN THE LA UNION STATION PROJECT

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.956
AS WELL SO -- YEAH THAT DOES --

01:56:37.023 --> 01:56:38.991
THAT MATCHING IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY

01:56:39.058 --> 01:56:40.993
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- AND

01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:42.495
AND THAT SAID DEFINITELY A GOOD

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:44.664
MODEL -- TO LOOK AT THIS BROADER

01:56:44.731 --> 01:56:46.232
PARTICIPATION BECAUSE THAT'S

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:47.867
REALLY HOW THE BIGGEST PROJECTS

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:48.668
GET DONE.

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:49.969
IS THROUGH SUCCESSFUL

01:56:50.036 --> 01:56:54.273
PARTNERSHIPS FEDERAL STATE AND

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.110
LOCAL.

01:56:57.176 --> 01:56:58.878
SO WELL WE WILL GET BACK TO ON

01:56:58.945 --> 01:56:59.512
THE BURBANK I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

01:56:59.579 --> 01:56:59.812
TELL OKAY.

01:56:59.879 --> 01:57:00.380
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

01:57:00.446 --> 01:57:00.580
VERY.

01:57:00.646 --> 01:57:01.514
CRITICAL TO ME -- THE BURBANK

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:03.216
STATION BURBANK AIRPORT IS JUST

01:57:03.282 --> 01:57:04.617
OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT BUT IT'S

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:09.021
A REGIONAL -- FIGHTER AND SO

01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:13.326
IT'S AND I'VE I'VE I DON'T THINK

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:15.361
IN THIS AREA SPEAKING JUST FOR

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:17.497
MYSELF BUT FROM HEARING A

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:18.931
CORRECTLY FROM.

MY COLLEAGUE IN ORANGE COUNTY --

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:26.506
I I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW VALUABLE.

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:28.241
THIS INVESTMENT IS GOING TO BE

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.675
AND TO WHAT EXTENT I THINK YOU

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:33.279
HAVE -- PARTNERS HERE THAT ARE

01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:36.816
WILLING TO HELP PUSH ALONG.

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:38.651
ALL CONVERSATIONS AND MAKE SURE

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:40.219
THAT THE LOCAL.

01:57:40.286 --> 01:57:41.721
INVESTMENT OR THE MATCHING AND

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:43.756
IF THERE'S MATCHING OPPORTUNITY

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:46.125
INVESTMENT IS TAKING PLACE.

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:47.827
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'D BE

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:49.362
HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ONE YOU

01:57:49.429 --> 01:57:49.962
WANNA SEE REALIZED [inaudible]

01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:54.600
THANK YOU.

01:57:54.667 --> 01:57:56.736
SO WELL TO STIR FINISH UP TO

01:57:56.803 --> 01:57:58.171
THIS PANEL.

01:57:58.237 --> 01:58:00.339
BRIAN -- WILL BE IN IN TERMS OF

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:01.541
HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN THE

01:58:01.607 --> 01:58:02.975
CENTRAL VALLEY REQUIRES STATE

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:05.711
SUBSIDY. TO OPERATE.

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:07.413
AND IS THAT A VIOLATION OF PROP

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:08.014
ONE EIGHTY THE STATE'S OF THE

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.882
PLANNED PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE

AND YOU CAN ASK THE THE PEER

02:05:11.704 --> 02:05:12.705
REVIEW COMMITTEE WHEN THEY COME

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:13.772

02:05:23.215 --> 02:05:24.350
TO HAVE THEIR INPUT INTO WHAT

02:05:24.416 --> 02:05:25.751
QUESTIONS NEED TO BE ASKED TO

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:27.319
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET A CHANCE

02:05:27.386 --> 02:05:29.688

THIRTY SEVEN COMPANIES.

02:05:57.416 --> 02:05:58.484
DECLINED.

02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:00.686

02:06:02.688 --> 02:06:04.924
GOING FORWARD AND WITH OUR

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:07.059
EXCUSE OR OF COURSE PEAS OR

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.861
ANYTHING GOING FORWARD NOW THAT

02:06:08.928 --> 02:06:10.095
WE HAVE.

02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:12.998
HE A NEW VISION.

02:06:13.065 --> 02:06:14.266
THIS BUILDING BLOCK.

02:06:14.333 --> 02:06:16.602
GOING FORWARD WITH ANY KIND OF I

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:19.004
KNOW WE'VE HAD FOR COUNTRY SHOW

02:06:19.071 --> 02:06:19.271
INTEREST.

02:06:19.338 --> 02:06:23.108
OF BUT THIS LEGISLATURE WAS SOLD

02:06:23.175 --> 02:06:24.710
ON THE APPROPRIATION THAT WILL

02:06:24.777 --> 02:06:28.013
PROVIDE CERTAINTY. FOR A PRIVATE

02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:29.181
INVESTMENT AND THAT HAS NOT

02:06:29.248 --> 02:06:32.584
OCCURRED -- SO WHAT EFFORTS ARE

02:06:32.651 --> 02:06:35.621
BEING DONE [inaudible]

02:06:35.688 --> 02:06:41.427
TO PROVIDE THAT -- INITIAL.

02:06:41.493 --> 02:06:43.162
WHAT WE TOLD THE LEGISLATURE

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:47.099
WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET FOR THIS?

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.801
FOR SURE SO FIRST OF ALL THE CAP

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:49.935
AND TRADE FUNDS ARE REALLY

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:51.070
IMPORTANT PART OF THE FUNDING

02:06:51.136 --> 02:06:52.805
STREAM AND THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO

02:06:52.871 --> 02:06:53.906
DELIVERING IT.

02:06:53.973 --> 02:06:55.207
I'M AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THEY

02:06:55.274 --> 02:06:57.343
HAVE BEEN COMING AND LARGER THAN

02:06:57.409 --> 02:06:58.677
WHAT WE ARE PLANNING ON AND IN

02:06:58.744 --> 02:07:00.045
THE BUDGET GOING FORWARD WHICH

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:00.346
IS.

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:02.915
IS HELPFUL -- WE DO AS I SAID

02:07:02.982 --> 02:07:05.084
BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT TO GET

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:06.585
TO ITS FULL COMPLETION WILL

02:07:06.652 --> 02:07:07.820
REQUIRE.

02:07:07.886 --> 02:07:09.221
A PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:11.023
ALONG SIDE THIS AND WE ARE

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:11.757
GETTING.

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:14.326
INCREASING INTEREST FROM PRIVATE

02:07:14.393 --> 02:07:15.394
INVESTORS TO SAY THEY WANT TO

02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:16.762
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WERE NOT AT

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:17.629
THE POINT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

02:07:17.696 --> 02:07:18.864
THAT REALLY CONCRETE ABOUT WHAT

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.499
THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:22.067
BUT CERTAINLY FROM THE BOARD'S

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:23.836
PERSPECTIVE AND FROM MY

02:07:23.902 --> 02:07:26.338
DIRECTION -- WE ARE GOING TO BE

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:29.308
EXPLORING THOSE IN AT THE RIGHT.

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:31.076
ACE AND TIME WHEN THERE IS A

02:07:31.143 --> 02:07:33.012
HIGH QUALITY INVESTMENT TO BE

02:07:33.078 --> 02:07:34.213
MADE THAT I WITH.

02:07:34.279 --> 02:07:35.848
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE COULD SAY

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:36.949
IF I WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

02:07:37.016 --> 02:07:38.884
THAT TRANSACTION I WOULD FEEL

02:07:38.951 --> 02:07:39.852
COMFORTABLE THAT THAT'S A GOOD

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:41.754
INVESTMENT SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:42.955
BE ABLE TO DELIVER.

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:44.256
CLEAR LOWER THE REST TO MAKE

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:46.125
THAT HAPPEN BUT IT'S AN

02:07:46.191 --> 02:07:46.725
IMPORTANT PART OF THE SUCCESS

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:47.926
GOING FORWARD.

02:07:47.993 --> 02:07:49.695
I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO I'M

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:50.662

EACH ONE IS DRAMATICALLY

02:07:59.905 --> 02:08:01.473
DIFFERENT EACH TIME IT'S BEEN

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:04.510

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.745
HOW WERE WE ARE SURE THAT THIS

02:08:06.812 --> 02:08:08.213

THE MAJOR ISSUE MAJOR FEATURES

02:12:05.217 --> 02:12:07.819
AT THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:08.987
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT I'LL GO

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.222
PRETTY QUICKLY BECAUSE I THINK

02:12:10.289 --> 02:12:11.757
MANY OF THESE WERE TOUCHED ON BY

02:12:11.823 --> 02:12:13.625
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS BUT JUST

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:16.028
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS --

02:12:16.094 --> 02:12:16.561
SO THE FIRST THING AS WAS

02:12:16.628 --> 02:12:18.263
MENTIONED EXTENSIVELY IS THAT

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:19.631
THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT SORT

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:23.635
OF REFOCUSES THE PROJECTS ON

02:12:23.702 --> 02:12:25.070
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- AND

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:26.271
ANTICIPATES OF LAUNCHING EARLY

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:28.740
INTERIM SERVICES ON THAT SEGMENT.

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:29.675
HI THIS IS REALLY DRIVEN BY A

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:32.044
COUPLE OF FACTORS FIRST IS THE

02:12:32.110 --> 02:12:33.745
ANALYSIS DONE BY THE EARLY TRAIN

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:34.980
OPERATOR WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT

02:12:35.047 --> 02:12:37.249
ABOUT THAT -- SO THE EARLY TRAIN

02:12:37.316 --> 02:12:39.318
OPERATOR WAS -- WAS TASKED BY

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:40.852
THE AUTHORITY WITH FOCUSING ON

02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:42.587
REALLY TWO DIFFERENT SEGMENTS

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:43.822
LOOKING AT THE SAN FRANCISCO TO

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:45.223
GILROY SEGMENT AND WERE SAID TO

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:47.626
BAKERSFIELD -- THE EARLY TRAIN

02:12:47.693 --> 02:12:48.927
OPERATOR MADE A VARIETY OF KEY

02:12:48.994 --> 02:12:51.430
ASSUMPTIONS AND ITS ANALYSIS FOR

02:12:51.496 --> 02:12:52.898
EXAMPLE IT MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS

02:12:52.964 --> 02:12:54.666
ABOUT OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS

02:12:54.733 --> 02:12:55.701
OTHER TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL

02:12:55.767 --> 02:12:58.970
PROJECTS OCCURRING ALSO -- IT

02:12:59.037 --> 02:13:00.138
MADE SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:02.374
SEAMLESS INTEGRATION WITH OTHER

02:13:02.441 --> 02:13:04.576
TRANSPORTATION PROVIDERS ON BOTH

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:05.711
REAL PROVIDERS AS WELL AS BY

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:08.547
SERVICES -- AND IT ALSO ASSUMES

02:13:08.613 --> 02:13:10.515
THE TERMINATION OF THE EXISTING --

02:13:10.582 --> 02:13:12.517
COMPETING SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE

02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:13.885
OUT THAT MERCED.

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:15.320
SO GIVEN THESE ASSUMPTIONS THE

02:13:15.387 --> 02:13:16.788
EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR CONCLUDED

02:13:16.855 --> 02:13:17.989
THAT THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:19.291
LINE WOULD BE THE PREFERRED

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:22.694
OPTION OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO TO

02:13:22.761 --> 02:13:23.995
GILROY SEGMENT.

02:13:24.062 --> 02:13:26.765
US A SECOND -- BASICALLY THIS --

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:27.666
DECISION TO FOCUS ON WERE SAID

02:13:27.733 --> 02:13:29.668
TO BAKERSFIELD WAS INFORMED BY

02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:31.503
THE REVISED COST ESTIMATES SO

02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:33.071
THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.706
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT --

02:13:34.773 --> 02:13:36.308
REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF ONE

02:13:36.375 --> 02:13:38.110
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN

02:13:38.176 --> 02:13:39.111
THE COST OF THE INITIAL

02:13:39.177 --> 02:13:41.380
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT TO A TOTAL

02:13:41.446 --> 02:13:41.980
OF TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION

02:13:42.047 --> 02:13:43.081
DOLLARS.

02:13:43.148 --> 02:13:44.649
AS YOU HEARD FROM THE AUTHORITY

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:46.385
THIS IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN

02:13:46.451 --> 02:13:48.787
INCREASE IN THERE CAN ESTIMATES

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.589
FOR CONTINGENCIES.

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:51.623
SO ONE THING I JUST WANTED TO

02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:53.291
MAKE URE WAS CLEARING A THERE'S

02:13:53.358 --> 02:13:54.393
SOME DISCUSSION ON THE P. TEN

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:56.628
AND P. -- SEVENTY BUT I JUST

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:59.264
WANTED TO TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:13:59.331 --> 02:13:59.865
AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A

02:13:59.931 --> 02:14:00.999
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.

02:14:01.066 --> 02:14:02.167
THAT'S WHAT THE AUTHORITY SAYS

02:14:02.234 --> 02:14:04.903
IS THE MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THIS

02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:06.371
COST INCREASE SO ESSENTIALLY

02:14:06.438 --> 02:14:07.606
PREVIOUSLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING

02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:09.241
IS SETTING THEIR BASELINE COST

02:14:09.307 --> 02:14:10.342
ESTIMATE.

02:14:10.409 --> 02:14:13.245
SUCH THAT THERE IS A 90% CHANCE

02:14:13.311 --> 02:14:15.046
THAT BASED ON THEIR MODELING THE

02:14:15.113 --> 02:14:16.548
PROJECT WOULD GO OVER THAT BASED

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:17.949
ON COST ESTIMATE.

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:20.252
US THAT WAS A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE.

02:14:20.318 --> 02:14:21.987
APPROACH AND NOW THEY'RE TAKING

02:14:22.053 --> 02:14:23.155
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE A MORE

02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:25.424
OF AN INDUSTRY STANDARD APPROACH

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:26.057
FOR THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD

02:14:26.124 --> 02:14:27.225
MINE.

02:14:27.292 --> 02:14:27.826
AND THEY'RE TAKING WHAT THEY

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:30.095
WHAT THEY CALL A P. SEVENTY

02:14:30.162 --> 02:14:30.862
ESTIMATES THEY'RE SETTING THE

02:14:30.929 --> 02:14:32.464
BASELINE COST ESTIMATES SUCH

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:34.065
THAT THERE IS A 30% CHANCE THAT

02:14:34.132 --> 02:14:35.801
THEY'LL GO OVER BUDGET RATHER

02:14:35.867 --> 02:14:37.869
THAN A 90% CHANCE -- SO THEY'RE

02:14:37.936 --> 02:14:39.271
DOING THAT WITH THAT MERCED TO

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:40.772
BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT.

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:43.608
pREVISE THE COST ESTIMATES FOR

02:14:43.675 --> 02:14:44.476
THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECT

02:14:44.543 --> 02:14:47.712
THESE BEYOND MERCED TO

02:14:47.779 --> 02:14:48.413
BAKERSFIELD.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.214
THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT ALSO

02:14:49.281 --> 02:14:50.449
IDENTIFIES FUNDING FROM A

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:52.117
VARIETY OF SURF SOURCES AS WAS

02:14:52.184 --> 02:14:53.685
AS WAS MENTIONED INCLUDING

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:54.986
PROPOSITION ONE A BOND FUNDS

02:14:55.053 --> 02:14:56.755
FEDERAL FUNDS AND CAP AND TRADE

02:14:56.822 --> 02:14:58.390
REVENUE THROUGH.

02:14:58.457 --> 02:14:59.324
TWENTY THIRTY IN TOTAL THE

02:14:59.391 --> 02:15:01.259
AUTHORITY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL

02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:04.029
HAVE A TOTAL OF TWENTY POINT.

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:05.197
FIVE BETWEEN TWENTY POINT FIVE

02:15:05.263 --> 02:15:06.731
IN TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE

02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:09.301
BILLION DOLLARS FROM THOSE

02:15:09.367 --> 02:15:10.702
SOURCES AT THREE TWENTY THIRTY

02:15:10.769 --> 02:15:12.137
THE AUTHORITY ALSO ESTIMATES

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:13.271
THAT THE COST OF BOTH

02:15:13.338 --> 02:15:14.406
CONSTRUCTING THAT WERE SAID TO

02:15:14.473 --> 02:15:16.107
BASE BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT AS WELL

02:15:16.174 --> 02:15:17.876
AS THE OTHER COMMITMENTS THAT

02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:19.644
THE AUTHORITY HAS -- HAS MADE

02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:21.513
INCLUDING A THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:15:21.580 --> 02:15:22.814
WORK FOR ALL OF PHASE ONE AND

02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:24.282
THOSE BACK IN PROJECTS THAT WE

02:15:24.349 --> 02:15:25.150
HEARD ABOUT.

02:15:25.217 --> 02:15:26.985
ON THAT THAT WOULD TOTAL ABOUT

02:15:27.052 --> 02:15:27.586
TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION SO

02:15:27.652 --> 02:15:29.988
THAT THEY'LL HAVE -- SUFFICIENT

02:15:30.055 --> 02:15:31.389
FUNDING TO COMPLETE THAT.

02:15:31.456 --> 02:15:33.058
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE THERE'S

02:15:33.124 --> 02:15:35.026
A TABLE THAT THAT SUMMARIZES

02:15:35.093 --> 02:15:35.927
BOTH THE FUNDING THAT THEY

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.162
BELIEVE IS AVAILABLE AS WELL AS

02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:39.130
THE COSTS THAT ARE ESTIMATED AS

02:15:39.197 --> 02:15:40.699
OF THIS POINTS. FOR THAT MERCED

02:15:40.765 --> 02:15:42.968
TO BAKERSFIELD MINE.

02:15:43.034 --> 02:15:45.470
US SO WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE

02:15:45.537 --> 02:15:46.905
PROJECT AT THE REPORT ASSUMES

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:49.140
THE AVAILABILITY FOR OF

02:15:49.207 --> 02:15:50.442
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE

02:15:50.509 --> 02:15:52.444
COMPLETION OF PHASE ONE BUT

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:52.978
DOESN'T IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:54.713
FUNDING.

02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:56.515
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN WE

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:57.616
HIGHLIGHT SOME ISSUES FOR

02:15:57.682 --> 02:15:58.917
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:00.385
THAT REALLY FLOW FROM THOSE

02:16:00.452 --> 02:16:01.853
MAJOR FEATURES OF THE PROJECT

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:03.588
AFTER REPORT THAT I HIGHLIGHTED

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:04.789
PREVIOUSLY.

02:16:04.856 --> 02:16:06.825
I SO FIRST WE NOTE THAT THE

02:16:06.892 --> 02:16:08.960
SUCCESS OF THAT INTERIM SERVICE

02:16:09.027 --> 02:16:10.061
IS REALLY GONNA DEPEND VERY

02:16:10.128 --> 02:16:12.697
HEAVILY ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.266
SO AS I MENTIONED THE EARLY

02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:16.501
TRAIN OPERATORS ASSUMPTIONS.

02:16:16.568 --> 02:16:18.670
OR ANALYSIS WAS REALLY PROMISED

02:16:18.737 --> 02:16:19.971
ONLINE A VARIETY OF THINGS

02:16:20.038 --> 02:16:20.939
HAPPENING IN TERMS OF CAPITAL

02:16:21.006 --> 02:16:22.507
PROJECTS IN TERMS OF OTHER

02:16:22.574 --> 02:16:23.708
OPERATIONS.

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.110
I'M TO THE EXTENT THOSE THINGS

02:16:25.176 --> 02:16:27.812
DON'T HAPPEN ARE THE RIDERSHIP

02:16:27.879 --> 02:16:29.381
THE REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT ARE --

02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:31.349
CURRENTLY EXPECTED MAY NOT

02:16:31.416 --> 02:16:33.251
MATERIALIZE SO WE WANTED TO

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:34.286
HIGHLIGHT THAT.

02:16:34.352 --> 02:16:35.987
SECOND WE WANTED TO NOTE THAT

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:37.923
THE ACTUAL PROJECT COSTS COULD

02:16:37.989 --> 02:16:39.190
BE HIGHER THAN ARE CURRENTLY

02:16:39.257 --> 02:16:40.458
ANTICIPATED.

02:16:40.525 --> 02:16:42.661
PART OF THAT IS AS WE KNOW THIS

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:44.996
IS A VERY LARGE PROJECT IT'S HAD

02:16:45.063 --> 02:16:47.666
ITS HAD PASSED COST INCREASES --

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:49.467
IT WOULDN'T BE SURPRISING AT ALL

02:16:49.534 --> 02:16:51.169
IF IT HAS FUTURE COST INCREASES

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:53.171
PART OF THIS IS JUST YOU KNOW.

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:54.573
THESE KIND OF PROJECTS DO YOU

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.541
FROM TIME TO TIME HOWEVER THERE

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.043
SOME SPECIFIC ASPECT OF THIS

02:16:58.109 --> 02:17:00.412
PROJECT THAT I THINK -- RAISE

02:17:00.478 --> 02:17:01.913
THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL COST

02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:04.649
INCREASES ONE IS SCHEDULING

02:17:04.716 --> 02:17:06.117
SLIPS WHICH MAY WELL HAPPEN

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:07.385
PARTICULARLY GIVEN ALL THE

02:17:07.452 --> 02:17:08.453
ISSUES WITH THE FEDERAL

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:09.120
GOVERNMENT THAT WERE

02:17:09.187 --> 02:17:11.089
ENCOUNTERING -- AND THAT WOULD

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.791
NATURALLY PROBABLY HAVE RAISE

02:17:12.857 --> 02:17:14.993
SOME COST PRESSURES SO THAT'S

02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.329
ONE THING TO NOTE -- BUT ALSO

02:17:17.395 --> 02:17:18.463
JUST THIS AS IF THAT THE SCALE

02:17:18.530 --> 02:17:20.465
OF THIS PROJECT I AM FINALLY I

02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:22.200
JUST WANTED TO KIND OF COME BACK

02:17:22.267 --> 02:17:24.169
TO THAT P. SEVENTY P. TEN I KNOW

02:17:24.235 --> 02:17:25.904
IT'S A LITTLE BIT -- TECHNICAL

02:17:25.971 --> 02:17:27.939
OF AN ISSUE BUT AS I MENTIONED

02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:29.975
IN THE EARLIER THEY REVISED

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:30.942
THEIR METHODOLOGY FOR THAT

02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:32.510
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT

02:17:32.577 --> 02:17:34.613
BUT NOT FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT.

02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:36.281
SO THEY'RE STILL USING THAT P.

02:17:36.348 --> 02:17:37.682
TEN APPROACH WHICH IS A MORE

02:17:37.749 --> 02:17:39.584
AGGRESSIVE BUDGETING APPROACH

02:17:39.651 --> 02:17:40.785
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECT

02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:42.554
AND SO THAT PROBABLY RAISES THE

02:17:42.621 --> 02:17:44.022
LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE COULD BE.

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:46.591
ADDITIONAL COST INCREASES FOR

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:47.592
THE PROJECT.

02:17:47.659 --> 02:17:48.827
THE THIRD ONE IS TO NOTE THAT

02:17:48.893 --> 02:17:50.028
IT'S UNCLEAR IF THERE'S GONNA BE

02:17:50.095 --> 02:17:52.030
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO COMPLETE

02:17:52.097 --> 02:17:53.264
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD.

02:17:53.331 --> 02:17:55.667
US SO AS WAS NOTED THE CURRENT

02:17:55.734 --> 02:17:56.768
ESTIMATE IS THAT THERE WILL BE

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:58.703
SUFFICIENT FUNDING BUT AS WE

02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:00.105
HEARD ALSO THERE'S UNCERTAINTY

02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:01.973
ABOUT THE FEDERAL FUNDS THE

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.042
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS -- HAS

02:18:04.109 --> 02:18:05.777
TAKEN ACTION TO TRY TO RESCIND

02:18:05.844 --> 02:18:08.079
THAT ROUGHLY ONE BILLION DOLLAR

02:18:08.146 --> 02:18:09.047
PORTION THEY'VE ALSO THREATENS

02:18:09.114 --> 02:18:11.516
THE OTHER TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:12.784
SO THERE'S SOME CHANCE THAT THE

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:13.985
STATE WILL LOSE SOME OR ALL OF

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:15.553
THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS.

02:18:15.620 --> 02:18:17.455
ADDITIONALLY CAP AND TRADE IS

02:18:17.522 --> 02:18:18.957
YOU KNOW BY ITS NATURE SOMEWHAT

02:18:19.024 --> 02:18:20.959
UNCERTAIN SO IT'S UNCLEAR

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:23.261
WHETHER REVENUES WILL COME IN AS

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:24.796
PROJECTED FOR THAT FUND SOURCE.

02:18:24.863 --> 02:18:26.464
AND OF COURSE IF COSTS INCREASE

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:28.166
FOR THE PROJECT THAT COULD ALSO

02:18:28.233 --> 02:18:30.435
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HIM TO

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:32.537
FULLY FUNDS WHAT -- IS IS

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:35.273
CURRENTLY ENVISIONED WITHIN THE

02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.141
FUNDING AVAILABLE.

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:38.343
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- ELEVEN WE

02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:40.478
ALSO AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:18:40.545 --> 02:18:41.980
THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN BEYOND

02:18:42.047 --> 02:18:43.381
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD.

02:18:43.448 --> 02:18:44.916
SO REALLY THE BULK OF THE COST

02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:46.351
OF THE PROJECT ARE BEYOND MERCED

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:47.752
TO BAKERSFIELD AS ARE THE SORT

02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:50.021
OF MOST COMPLEX ENGINEERING

02:18:50.088 --> 02:18:51.556
COMPONENTS OF THE PROJECT.

02:18:51.623 --> 02:18:53.024
AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

02:18:53.091 --> 02:18:54.626
THE STATE WOULD FUND THAT -- IT

02:18:54.693 --> 02:18:55.927
SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE STATE

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:57.395
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO FIND MUCH

02:18:57.462 --> 02:18:58.596
OF THAT FROM THE GENERAL FUND IF

02:18:58.663 --> 02:19:00.098
IT'S TO COMPLETE THIS PRACTICE

02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:03.268
PROJECT AT THIS POINT -- IN LESS

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:04.969
MOTHER FUNDING TO REALIZES --

02:19:05.036 --> 02:19:06.504
FIFTH JUST WANTED TO ALSO

02:19:06.571 --> 02:19:07.906
HIGHLIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.407
HAS ADDITIONAL OPTIONS IN THIS

02:19:09.474 --> 02:19:11.042
WAS MENTIONED BY PREVIOUS

02:19:11.109 --> 02:19:12.610
SPEAKERS AS WELL BUT I THINK IT

02:19:12.677 --> 02:19:14.946
REALLY BEARS REPEATING THIS IS

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:17.015
AN ARGUE OF IT REALLY -- GOOD

02:19:17.082 --> 02:19:18.783
TIME TO LEGISLATURE TO STEP BACK

02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:20.552
AND THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS THAT

02:19:20.618 --> 02:19:22.520
MIGHT WANT TO PERCEIVE GOING

02:19:22.587 --> 02:19:24.456
FORWARD THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:19:24.522 --> 02:19:25.490
SIGNALING A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:27.358
CHANGE IN APPROACH WE HAVE THIS

02:19:27.425 --> 02:19:29.728
BIG FUNDING GAP -- REALLY I

02:19:29.794 --> 02:19:31.629
THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO TO

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:34.365
STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:35.467
OPTION SHOULD BE PURSUED.

02:19:35.533 --> 02:19:36.735
I NEED TO NOTE THAT REALLY THE

02:19:36.801 --> 02:19:39.871
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD -- OPTION

02:19:39.938 --> 02:19:41.139
IS NOT THE ONLY ONE ON THE TABLE

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:43.041
IT'S NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:43.675
THAT'S OUT THERE THE LEGISLATURE

02:19:43.742 --> 02:19:45.009
COULD THINK ABOUT DOING A

02:19:45.076 --> 02:19:46.911
SMALLER SEGMENT OR LARGER

02:19:46.978 --> 02:19:48.379
SEGMENT AND THAT.

02:19:48.446 --> 02:19:49.914
THE LEGISLATURE COULD COMMIT TO

02:19:49.981 --> 02:19:51.750
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AND REALLY --

02:19:51.816 --> 02:19:53.451
PURSUE THAT OR COULD LOOK AT

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:55.153
OTHER KINDS OF PURCHASE BOTH ON

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:57.188
AN INTERIM BASIS OR POTENTIALLY

02:19:57.255 --> 02:19:59.057
ON A LONG TERM BASIS SO REALLY --

02:19:59.124 --> 02:20:00.692
THEY'RE PROBABLY A VARIETY OF

02:20:00.759 --> 02:20:01.459
OPTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:03.962
THERE -- IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:04.796
TWELVE WE HIGHLIGHT SOME

02:20:04.863 --> 02:20:06.464
QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:09.901
MAY WISH TO ASK AS ITS EXPLORING

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.636
THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS -- THE

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.304
FIRST IS COST SO THAT'S GOING TO

02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:15.707
BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF ANY KIND

02:20:15.774 --> 02:20:16.474
OF DECISION.

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:17.709
I THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:19.477
SEGMENTS THE TWELVE POINT FOUR

02:20:19.544 --> 02:20:21.246
BILLION CURRENT ESTIMATE --

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:22.547
THOSE WERE SAD AND BAKERSFIELD

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:23.948
EXTENSIONS ARE CURRENTLY

02:20:24.015 --> 02:20:26.484
ESTIMATED. TO ADD TWO POINT FIVE

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:27.919
BILLION OR ONE POINT FOUR

02:20:27.986 --> 02:20:30.255
BILLION RESPECTIVELY -- SO THAT

02:20:30.321 --> 02:20:34.559
THOSE ARE GONNA BE TRADE -- FOR

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:36.795
THOSE COSTS -- OR EVEN EXTENDING

02:20:36.861 --> 02:20:39.197
IT FURTHER FOR EXAMPLE.

02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:41.199
I NEXT TRANSPORTATION BENEFITS I

02:20:41.266 --> 02:20:42.934
THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

02:20:43.001 --> 02:20:44.035
FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:45.303
IS WHAT ARE THE TRANSPORTATION

02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:46.838
BENEFITS PROVIDED BY EACH

02:20:46.905 --> 02:20:49.407
DIFFERENT OPTION AND HOW DO THEY

02:20:49.474 --> 02:20:50.475
COMPARE -- ESPECIALLY.

02:20:50.542 --> 02:20:51.810
YOU KNOW CAN ONSIDERING OTHER

02:20:51.876 --> 02:20:53.545
ALTERNATIVE USES OF THE FUNDS

02:20:53.611 --> 02:20:54.779
AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE

02:20:54.846 --> 02:20:55.947
QUESTIONS PREVIOUSLY WERE

02:20:56.014 --> 02:20:56.815
GETTING AT THAT.

02:20:56.881 --> 02:20:58.016
ON FOR EXAMPLE IN TERMS OF

02:20:58.082 --> 02:21:00.919
RIDERSHIP ON HOW MUCH DOES YOU

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:02.754
TO DO THESE OPTIONS ARE PROVIDE

02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:04.022
IN TERMS OF RIDERSHIP BENEFITS

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:06.024
VERSUS OTHER OPTIONS PER PERHAPS

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:08.459
IN SOME OF THE MORE POPULATED

02:21:08.526 --> 02:21:09.527
AREAS OF THE STATE.

02:21:09.594 --> 02:21:10.862
I THE NEXT ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:12.564
THE EFFECTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.632
AND THOSE BOTH ARE THINGS LIKE

02:21:14.699 --> 02:21:16.067
CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS BECAUSE IT

02:21:16.134 --> 02:21:17.135
CAN BE VERY DESTRUCTIVE TO

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:18.336
COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THIS KIND OF

02:21:18.403 --> 02:21:19.404
COULD -- CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:21.840
THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF HAVING

02:21:21.906 --> 02:21:23.541
THESE JOBS IN AND WE HEARD A

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:25.176
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:26.678
AND THEN FINALLY MAJOR RISKS AND

02:21:26.744 --> 02:21:28.947
UNCERTAINTIES ARE VERY CRITICAL

02:21:29.013 --> 02:21:30.215
HERE WE'VE ALSO I KNOW THE

02:21:30.281 --> 02:21:31.583
COMMITTEE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH

02:21:31.649 --> 02:21:32.617
MANY OF THESE RISKS AND

02:21:32.684 --> 02:21:33.751
UNCERTAINTIES BUT CERTAINLY

02:21:33.818 --> 02:21:35.019
THERE'S CONSTRUCTION COST

02:21:35.086 --> 02:21:36.187
INCREASED RISK.

02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:38.256
BUT IS ALSO RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

02:21:38.323 --> 02:21:39.858
OUR COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION

02:21:39.924 --> 02:21:40.458
ONE A AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL

02:21:40.525 --> 02:21:42.293
REQUIREMENT SO THOSE ARE ALL THE

02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:43.194
KINDS OF THINGS THAT.

02:21:43.261 --> 02:21:44.395
ARE THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA HAVE

02:21:44.462 --> 02:21:45.697
TO KEEP IN MIND.

02:21:45.763 --> 02:21:48.032
WE THINK AS IT'S REVIEWING

02:21:48.099 --> 02:21:51.402
POSSIBLE OPTIONS. FOR MOVING

02:21:51.469 --> 02:21:53.905
FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.

02:21:53.972 --> 02:21:54.339
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

02:21:54.405 --> 02:21:56.708
WHO?

02:21:56.774 --> 02:21:58.409
GOT IT MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST I

02:21:58.476 --> 02:22:00.445
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:22:00.511 --> 02:22:02.580
BE HERE TODAY -- I'VE HAD THE

02:22:02.647 --> 02:22:04.716
PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU OVER A

02:22:04.782 --> 02:22:07.085
IN A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW AND AND

02:22:07.151 --> 02:22:08.586
I HOPE IT'S BEEN USEFUL.

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:10.255
I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S

02:22:10.321 --> 02:22:12.223
BEEN A PLEASURE WORKING WITH

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:13.358
YOUR STAFF THEY HAVE DONE

02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:15.393
EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL WORK

02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:17.028
PREPARING FOR THESE HEARINGS --

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:19.697
AND I CAN SEE THE VALUE OF THESE

02:22:19.764 --> 02:22:21.499
PROCEEDINGS OVER A PERIOD OF

02:22:21.566 --> 02:22:23.701
TIME I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I

02:22:23.768 --> 02:22:26.838
HATE TESTIFYING AFTER THE LA --

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:28.473
BECAUSE I NOT SURE WHAT I HAVE

02:22:28.539 --> 02:22:30.375
TO ADD THAT I MY TENDENCY IS TO

02:22:30.441 --> 02:22:31.743
SAY WHAT SHE SAID AND THEN DO

02:22:31.809 --> 02:22:33.411
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT I'M

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:35.480
NOT GOING TO DO THAT AT LEAST I

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:36.681
WILL SUMMARIZE THIS.

02:22:36.748 --> 02:22:38.316
THERE HAVE SO FAR BEEN SEVEN

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:40.885
BUSINESS PLANS BEGINNING IN TWO

02:22:40.952 --> 02:22:43.054
THOUSAND AND ENDING THUS FAR IN

02:22:43.121 --> 02:22:43.688
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT WHAT WE'RE

02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:45.690
LOOKING AT TODAY IS ALMOST A

02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:47.458
REVISED TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS

02:22:47.525 --> 02:22:48.459
PLAN.

02:22:48.526 --> 02:22:50.461
OR TWENTY NINETEEN OVER THIS

02:22:50.528 --> 02:22:52.730
TIME THE PROJECT HAS EVOLVED

02:22:52.797 --> 02:22:54.699
FROM A PROJECT THAT WAS GONNA

02:22:54.766 --> 02:22:56.601
SERVE SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES

02:22:56.668 --> 02:22:58.436
SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO WITH

02:22:58.503 --> 02:22:59.837
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:22:59.904 --> 02:23:02.407
THE ONE WHICH NOW ONLY PROPOSES

02:23:02.473 --> 02:23:03.942
TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:23:04.008 --> 02:23:07.445
SECTION ADDING -- MERCED AND

02:23:07.512 --> 02:23:08.146
BAKER SEAL.

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.814
THIS EVOLUTION THAT WE HAVE

02:23:09.881 --> 02:23:11.649
WATCHED HAS BEEN DRIVEN

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:14.052
INEXORABLY BY ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED

02:23:14.118 --> 02:23:15.853
TO RESPOND TO THREE DIFFERENT

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.155
FORCES.

02:23:17.221 --> 02:23:18.556
ONE CONTINUALLY INCREASING

02:23:18.623 --> 02:23:20.658
CONSTRUCTION COSTS AS THEY'VE

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:23.227
INQUIRED ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.

02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:24.762
SECOND REDUCTIONS IN THE

02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:26.998
ESTIMATES OF MONEY THAT THEY HAD --

02:23:27.065 --> 02:23:28.466
CREDIBLY COULD HAVE.

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:30.034
AND THIS IS WITH THE PROJECT AND

02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:31.769
HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED SINCE THE

02:23:31.836 --> 02:23:33.037
BEGINNING.

02:23:33.104 --> 02:23:35.039
AND FINALLY THE IMPACT OF THE

02:23:35.106 --> 02:23:37.408
FRA GRANTS OF THAT SPECIFIED

02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:39.744
THAT THE WORK WOULD BEGIN IN THE

02:23:39.811 --> 02:23:41.245
CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:23:41.312 --> 02:23:42.714
IN VERY BROAD TERMS TO THE

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:45.516
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT PER FOR OF

02:23:45.583 --> 02:23:47.518
RESPONDS BY SAYING THAT THE

02:23:47.585 --> 02:23:48.786
GOVERNOR.

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:50.221
OF IS COMMITTED TO AN OVERALL

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:52.156
VISION OF COMPLETING THIS SYSTEM

02:23:52.223 --> 02:23:54.492
BUT HE WANTS TO SEE THE SNOW

02:23:54.559 --> 02:23:55.927
CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION.

02:23:55.994 --> 02:23:58.196
COMPLETED FIRST IN ORDER TO

02:23:58.262 --> 02:23:59.897
DEVELOP IMMEDIATE BENEFITS TO

02:23:59.964 --> 02:24:02.266
DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY.

02:24:02.333 --> 02:24:04.002
AND TO DEMONSTRATE MANAGEMENT

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:06.304
CONFIDENCE I THINK THIS WOULD BE

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:09.307
CRITICAL IF THEY CAN DO THAT.

02:24:09.374 --> 02:24:10.441
THEY ARGUE THAT THE UTILITY A

02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:12.210
CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION CAN BE

02:24:12.276 --> 02:24:14.512
SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED BY ADDING

02:24:14.579 --> 02:24:16.247
THE LINKS TO MERCED AND THE

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:17.682
BAKERS FEEL.

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.050
THEY STATE THAT THE AUTHORITY

02:24:19.117 --> 02:24:20.451
WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL THE

02:24:20.518 --> 02:24:22.387
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR PHASE ONE

02:24:22.453 --> 02:24:24.122
AS IT'S BEEN PROMISED TO THE F.

02:24:24.188 --> 02:24:25.123
R. A..

02:24:25.189 --> 02:24:27.392
IN NETWORK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:29.060
BETTER ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:31.195
THINGS LIKE THE JAYCO TUNNELING

02:24:31.262 --> 02:24:32.296
FOR EXAMPLE.

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:34.165
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL EXTENSION TO

02:24:34.232 --> 02:24:36.534
MERCED -- IN CONNECTION WITH SAN

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:38.736
JOAQUIN WILL BE GOOD FOR ALL OF

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:40.605
THE SERVICES OF THE PROJECT AS

02:24:40.671 --> 02:24:42.106
WE'VE DISCUSSED EARLIER THAT IT

02:24:42.173 --> 02:24:43.875
WOULD INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR

02:24:43.941 --> 02:24:45.143
ALL.

02:24:45.209 --> 02:24:46.444
THREE IN RESULT IN A TOTAL

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:48.446
REDUCTION TO THE STATE OF ABOUT

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.048
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

02:24:50.114 --> 02:24:51.349
IN THE SUBSIDY FOR ALL THREE

02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:54.318
SERVICES -- IT IS NOT CLEAR WITH

02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:56.354
THE SPEED RAIL SERVICE PER SE

02:24:56.421 --> 02:24:58.256
WILL OPERATE AT A DEFICIT BUT

02:24:58.322 --> 02:25:00.091
THEY ARGUED THAT THE THE SOME OF

02:25:00.158 --> 02:25:02.760
THE THREE WILL LOSE THIRTY

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:04.095
MINUTE OF TWENTY MILLION LESS.

02:25:04.162 --> 02:25:06.230
A CRITICAL ASSERTION IS THAT THE

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:08.666
CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION INCLUDING

02:25:08.733 --> 02:25:09.934
THE ADDED LINKS FOR SEVEN

02:25:10.001 --> 02:25:11.736
BAKERSFIELD CAN BE FINANCED

02:25:11.803 --> 02:25:14.672
WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES.

02:25:14.739 --> 02:25:16.474
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO YOU THAT

02:25:16.541 --> 02:25:19.410
THIS PROPOSAL IS BASED ON THE

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:20.678
NUMBER OF US ASSUMPTIONS

02:25:20.745 --> 02:25:21.913
DISCUSSED IN THE PROJECT -- PLAY

02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:24.315
A REPORT THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE.

02:25:24.382 --> 02:25:26.017
OUT ON THE TABLE.

02:25:26.084 --> 02:25:27.418
ONE IS IT THE STATE WILL RETAIN

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:28.886
THE TWO AND A HALF BILLION ERA

02:25:28.953 --> 02:25:31.189
MONEY AND THE NINE HUNDRED

02:25:31.255 --> 02:25:32.290
TWENTY NINE MILLION.

02:25:32.356 --> 02:25:33.991
IN THE FY TWO OH TEN

02:25:34.058 --> 02:25:35.660
APPROPRIATION WHICH IF ALREADY

02:25:35.726 --> 02:25:39.997
HAS NOW FORMALLY DE OBLIGATED.

02:25:40.064 --> 02:25:40.965
THE SECOND IS IT THE RECEIPTS

02:25:41.032 --> 02:25:41.532
FROM CAP AND TRADE NEED TO

02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:43.301
AVERAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED

02:25:43.367 --> 02:25:45.002
MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:46.971
EVEN THEN IF THE RECEIPTS ONLY

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:48.339
AVERAGE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

02:25:48.406 --> 02:25:50.041
THERE WOULD BE A TEMPORARY GAP

02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:52.543
OF ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION

02:25:52.610 --> 02:25:54.212
TO GET TO THE END OF THE PROJECT.

02:25:54.278 --> 02:25:55.746
RECEIPTS WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:58.382
CONSIDERABLY HIGHER A TO AVOID

02:25:58.449 --> 02:26:00.818
THE NEED FOR BRIDGE FINANCING OR

02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:02.453
TO TRY TO MAKE UP FOR THE LOSS

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:04.555
OF THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:05.590
MILLION IF THAT IS.

02:26:05.656 --> 02:26:07.125
IS FINAL.

02:26:07.191 --> 02:26:08.659
THE PROPOSAL TO GENERATE

02:26:08.726 --> 02:26:10.128
OPERATING REVENUES FROM THE SALE

02:26:10.194 --> 02:26:11.863
OF CARBON CREDITS IS NEW AND

02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:13.531
NOVEL I'VE NOT SEEN THIS BEFORE

02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:15.366
IN EFFECT IT PUTS THE HIGH SPEED

02:26:15.433 --> 02:26:16.234
RAIL.

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:18.202
AUTHORITY IN THE IN THE POSITION

02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:20.371
OF GETTING 25% OF THE RECEIPTS

02:26:20.438 --> 02:26:21.772
FROM THE SALE OF THE CREDITS AND

02:26:21.839 --> 02:26:23.007
AT THE SAME TIME HAVING

02:26:23.074 --> 02:26:24.809
OPERATING AGENCY THAT SELLING

02:26:24.876 --> 02:26:25.743
THE CREDITS.

02:26:25.810 --> 02:26:27.011
I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS WRONG

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:29.147
OR RIGHT BUT I'VE NOT SEEN THIS

02:26:29.213 --> 02:26:29.947
BEFORE.

02:26:30.014 --> 02:26:31.616
NEXT THE CONSTRUCTION COST HAVE

02:26:31.682 --> 02:26:33.484
TO FALL WITHIN CURRENT ESTIMATES

02:26:33.551 --> 02:26:35.786
WIN ONE THERE IS NO EXPERIENCE

02:26:35.853 --> 02:26:37.622
WITH ELECTRIFICATION SIGNALING

02:26:37.688 --> 02:26:39.624
TRACKWORK ROLLING STOCK AND

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:41.092
SHOPS.

02:26:41.159 --> 02:26:42.260
INTO THE ESTIMATES THE NUMBER

02:26:42.326 --> 02:26:43.594
SAID THE MADERA AND SHELLFISH

02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:45.696
AFTER TO BAKERSFIELD LINKS

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.265
AROUND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS.

02:26:47.331 --> 02:26:50.001
OR AT A VERY EARLY STAGE OF

02:26:50.067 --> 02:26:51.669
DESIGN.

02:26:51.736 --> 02:26:52.803
FINALLY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:54.705
WITH ACE IN SAN JOAQUIN SERVICES

02:26:54.772 --> 02:26:56.107
CAN BE ESTABLISH AN OPERATOR

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:57.975
THIS PLAN WHEN IN FACT THESE

02:26:58.042 --> 02:27:01.045
PLANS ARE OR FOR PRELIMINARY AT

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:02.346
BEST.

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:02.947
AND IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT THE

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:05.383
IDEA OF HAVING ANOTHER AGENCY

02:27:05.449 --> 02:27:06.884
ASSUME THE OPERATING OFFICES IN

02:27:06.951 --> 02:27:08.853
ORDER TO AVOID PROPOSITION ONE A

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.022
LITIGATION ASSUMES THAT WILL

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:13.858
PASS MUSTER. FOR THESE REASONS

02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:15.726
WE CONCLUDE THAT THE PROPOSAL IS

02:27:15.793 --> 02:27:17.228
SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE OF

02:27:17.295 --> 02:27:18.996
UNCERTAINTY WITH AN ADVERSE

02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:20.665
OUTCOME AT ALMOST ANY POINT

02:27:20.731 --> 02:27:22.533
CAUSING FURTHER PROBLEMS FOR THE

02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:23.501
PROJECT.

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:25.636
INCLUDING LEGAL DELAYS AND

02:27:25.703 --> 02:27:27.405
POTENTIALLY A NEED FOR FURTHER

02:27:27.471 --> 02:27:29.407
FINANCE.

02:27:29.473 --> 02:27:30.208
AS DISCUSSED IN OUR EARLIER

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:31.676
LETTERS IN TESTIMONY EARLIER

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:33.511
THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE DOES

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:34.812
HAVE OPTIONS I DON'T WANNA GO

02:27:34.879 --> 02:27:36.347
THROUGH THESE IN GREAT DETAIL WE

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:38.049
ALREADY HAVE BUT YOU COULD JUST

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:39.483
STOP.

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.785
PAY THE CLAIMS AND WALK AWAY.

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:42.720
I DON'T THINK THIS ANYONE THINKS

02:27:42.787 --> 02:27:43.955
THIS IS A CREDIBLE OPTION

02:27:44.021 --> 02:27:45.623
BECAUSE YOU'D LOSE ALL THE VALUE

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:46.891
OF THIS CREATED.

02:27:46.958 --> 02:27:48.926
YOU COULD DO THE MINIMUM TO KEEP

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:50.695
THEIR OWN MONEY COMPLETE THE

02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:52.863
EXISTING CONTRACTS USE IT FOR

02:27:52.930 --> 02:27:54.865
LOWER SPEED OPERATION AND THEN

02:27:54.932 --> 02:27:56.467
STOP.

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:58.402
MAKING A SHORT CONNECTION WITH

02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:59.937
THE SAN JOAQUIN ROUTE AT MADERA

02:28:00.004 --> 02:28:01.672
AND IT CHAPTER WOULD PERMIT USE

02:28:01.739 --> 02:28:03.341
OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ALIGNMENT

02:28:03.407 --> 02:28:05.142
FOR SLOWER TRAINS.

02:28:05.209 --> 02:28:06.577
IT WOULD SAVE THE BEFORE BILLION

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:08.679
DOLLARS EXTRA TO MAKE THE HIGH

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:09.714
SPEED CONNECTIONS.

02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:11.115
AND IT WOULD SAVE THE COST OF

02:28:11.182 --> 02:28:13.017
ELECTRIFICATION WHICH IS AROUND

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:14.385
A BILLION DOLLARS AND THE COST

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:15.653
OF HIGH SPEED ROLLING STOCK

02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:17.955
WHICH IS AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED

02:28:18.022 --> 02:28:18.556
MILLION DOLLARS.

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.491
THIS WOULD BE A DISAPPOINTING

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:22.927
CHOICE IN WOULD CLEARLY NOT MAKE

02:28:22.994 --> 02:28:24.262
THE BEST USE OF THE WORKTHAT'S

02:28:24.328 --> 02:28:26.764
BEEN DONE SO FAR BUT IT IS A

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:28.199
VALID CHOICE.

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:30.301
YOU COULD ADOPT THE THE PROPOSAL

02:28:30.368 --> 02:28:32.503
AS IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.272
MAKING THE ADDED CONNECTIONS

02:28:34.338 --> 02:28:35.740
MERCED IN BAKERSFIELD USE HIGH

02:28:35.806 --> 02:28:38.509
SPEED ROLLING STOCK AND RE ROUTE

02:28:38.576 --> 02:28:39.343
THIS AND LIKE TEAMS.

02:28:39.410 --> 02:28:40.978
IF THE LEGISLATURE UPS TO

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:42.913
APPROVE THIS HOWEVER IT SHOULD

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.782
REQUIRE A MORE DETAILED AND

02:28:44.849 --> 02:28:46.817
AGREED OPERATING PLAN FOR THE

02:28:46.884 --> 02:28:47.952
SYSTEM INCLUDING THE

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:50.321
INTERACTIONS WITH ACE IN THE SAN

02:28:50.388 --> 02:28:51.422
JOAQUIN'S.

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:52.923
IN ADDITION SINCE DECISIONS TO

02:28:52.990 --> 02:28:54.358
GO BEYOND THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:28:54.425 --> 02:28:55.893
WILL BE DEFERRED

02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:57.495
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

02:28:57.561 --> 02:28:59.130
REQUIRE THE AUTHORITY TO

02:28:59.196 --> 02:29:00.564
UNDERTAKE A THOROUGH VALUE

02:29:00.631 --> 02:29:03.100
ENGINEERING ANALYSIS OF THE OF

02:29:03.167 --> 02:29:04.702
THIRTIES MAJOR COST DRIVERS FOR

02:29:04.769 --> 02:29:05.536
THE FUTURE.

02:29:05.603 --> 02:29:06.771
ESPECIALLY THE TUNNELING

02:29:06.837 --> 02:29:08.439
CONTACTS WHICH OF THE LARGEST

02:29:08.506 --> 02:29:10.941
SINGLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:12.310
REMAINING CONSTRUCTION AND THE

02:29:12.376 --> 02:29:15.246
PROJECT OR YOU COULD REMIT READ

02:29:15.313 --> 02:29:16.947
JUST RECOMMIT TO FACE.

02:29:17.014 --> 02:29:18.649
ONE THIS WOULD REASSURE BOTH THE

02:29:18.716 --> 02:29:20.051
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS IN

02:29:20.117 --> 02:29:21.619
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST AT THE

02:29:21.686 --> 02:29:22.620
PROJECT WILL REACH THEM

02:29:22.687 --> 02:29:23.788
EVENTUALLY.

02:29:23.854 --> 02:29:25.122
BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:29:25.189 --> 02:29:27.925
ACCOMPANIED BY A CREDIBLE

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:29.393
FINANCING SOURCE.

02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.661
IN ASSESSING THESE OPTIONS THERE

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:31.829
APPEARED TO BE SEVERAL STEPS

02:29:31.896 --> 02:29:33.397
THAT REALLY OUGHT TO BE DONE ONE

02:29:33.464 --> 02:29:36.100
IS TO CLARIFY THE ACTUAL

02:29:36.167 --> 02:29:37.835
COMMITMENT TO THE ERROR TO GET

02:29:37.902 --> 02:29:38.869
THE ERROR OF MONEY.

02:29:38.936 --> 02:29:40.805
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS

02:29:40.871 --> 02:29:43.040
ONLY INVOLVES CREATING A

02:29:43.107 --> 02:29:45.643
RAILROAD TRACK BASICALLY FROM

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:48.913
MADERA IT TO SCHEFTER THAT'S ALL.

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:50.047
DOESN'T REQUIRE ELECTRIFICATION

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.749
DOESN'T REQUIRE SIGNALING A FOR

02:29:51.816 --> 02:29:53.117
HIGH SPEED IT DOES REQUIRE

02:29:53.184 --> 02:29:55.753
ROLLING STOCK ONLY BUILDING A

02:29:55.820 --> 02:29:56.354
RAILROAD LINE FROM ONE TO THE

02:29:56.420 --> 02:29:57.355
OTHER.

02:29:57.421 --> 02:29:59.290
BUT IT'S DANGEROUS TO RELY ON MY

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:02.526
LEGAL OPINIONS THIS SHOULD BE --

02:30:02.593 --> 02:30:03.694
VERIFIED.

02:30:03.761 --> 02:30:05.563
SECOND YOU SHOULD OBTAIN FROM

02:30:05.629 --> 02:30:07.431
THE AUTHORITY THEIR OPINION AS

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:09.934
TO THE IMPLICATIONS OF PROP.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.001
ONE EIGHTY VIS A VIS ANY OF

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:12.503
THESE DECISIONS.

02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:14.004
AS DISCUSSED THE INTERIM

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.740
OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:17.408
LINE WILL INVOLVE OPERATING

02:30:17.475 --> 02:30:19.343
DEFICITS IN THIS MIGHT CLASH

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:20.845
WITH THE REQUIREMENT OR PROP UP

02:30:20.911 --> 02:30:23.247
WHEN A THE PROHIBITS AN

02:30:23.314 --> 02:30:24.582
OPERATING SUBSIDY.

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:25.850
THAT'S THIS GOOD BEE.

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:27.752
SUBSIDY COULD BE CARRIED BY

02:30:27.818 --> 02:30:29.253
ANOTHER AGENCY.

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.855
IN ADDITION A DECISION TO LIMIT

02:30:30.921 --> 02:30:32.556
THE LINE TO CONVENTIONAL SPEED

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:33.924
FOR MADERA DISH AFTER IN THE

02:30:33.991 --> 02:30:34.825
INTERIM.

02:30:34.892 --> 02:30:36.327
MIGHT CLASH WITH THE SPEED AND

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.828
TRIP TIME REQUIREMENTS OF

02:30:37.895 --> 02:30:39.663
PROPOSITION ONE A SO WE NEED TO

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:42.199
KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE STORY

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:43.100
HERE.

02:30:43.167 --> 02:30:45.136
I WAS I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HEAR

02:30:45.202 --> 02:30:46.437
MISTER MADONNA AND DANCES SAY

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:47.104
EARLIER.

02:30:47.171 --> 02:30:49.206
THAT I THINK YOU NEED A MUCH

02:30:49.273 --> 02:30:50.374
MORE COMPLETE REPORT ON THE

02:30:50.441 --> 02:30:52.209
INTERCONNECTIONS WITH ACE IN THE

02:30:52.276 --> 02:30:53.778
SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE HOUSES GOING

02:30:53.844 --> 02:30:55.679
TO WORK WHO'S GONNA DO WHAT.

02:30:55.746 --> 02:30:57.448
WHAT KIND WITH THE CUP WITH THE

02:30:57.515 --> 02:30:58.516
COST WITH THE DEMANDS WOOD OF

02:30:58.582 --> 02:31:02.353
THE OVERALL PLAN SO IT SHOULD BE

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.121
MADE FOR THIS?

02:31:04.188 --> 02:31:05.556
AND I THINK THAT THE STATE AND

02:31:05.623 --> 02:31:06.190
ITS STATE REAL PLAN SHOULD ALSO

02:31:06.257 --> 02:31:07.825
BE COMMITTED INVOLVED AND

02:31:07.892 --> 02:31:09.927
COMMITTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE

02:31:09.994 --> 02:31:11.395
RESULTS OF THAT YOU HAVE A

02:31:11.462 --> 02:31:12.596
BETTER IDEA.

02:31:12.663 --> 02:31:14.398
WHAT WILL REALLY HAPPEN IF THE

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:16.834
LINE IS OPERATED THE WAY IT IS

02:31:16.901 --> 02:31:18.803
PROPOSED?

02:31:18.869 --> 02:31:20.671
ALSO WE NEED TO ASSESS THE

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.473
IMPACT OF THE F. FOR A POSITION

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:24.108
OF SIMPLY WALKING AWAY FROM THE

02:31:24.175 --> 02:31:26.644
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AS A FORMER.

02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:28.379
FRA EMPLOYEE I'VE NEVER SEEN

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:30.815
ANYTHING LIKE THIS I DON'T KNOW.

02:31:30.881 --> 02:31:33.617
HOW THIS CAN CONTINUE BUT I

02:31:33.684 --> 02:31:35.219
CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:31:35.286 --> 02:31:36.854
WORK AROUND PLAN IS?

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:38.889
IN CASE IT REMAINS THIS WAY AND

02:31:38.956 --> 02:31:40.991
YET I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW THAT

02:31:41.058 --> 02:31:42.660
OR THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

02:31:42.726 --> 02:31:44.962
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT IT

02:31:45.029 --> 02:31:47.565
COULD STOP EVERYTHING.

02:31:47.631 --> 02:31:48.132
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL

02:31:48.199 --> 02:31:48.966
WITH.

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:50.768
OVERALL THE PROJECT UPDATE

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:53.070
REPORT IS CERTAINLY A STEP BUT

02:31:53.137 --> 02:31:55.206
IT'S ONLY A STEP AND CLARIFYING

02:31:55.272 --> 02:31:57.641
WHAT THE AUTHORITY MAY BE ABLE

02:31:57.708 --> 02:31:59.009
TO ACCOMPLISH.

02:31:59.076 --> 02:32:01.345
A LOT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:02.713
TO RESOLVE UNCERTAINTIES IN

02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:04.181
MENTIONED INCLUDING THE

02:32:04.248 --> 02:32:05.883
OPERATING PLAN BUT ALSO THE

02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:07.751
UNCERTAINTIES AROUND A LOT OF

02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:09.353
THE PROJECTED COSTS.

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:11.755
ALL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND

02:32:11.822 --> 02:32:13.691
GUIDANCE IS REALLY NEEDED TO

02:32:13.757 --> 02:32:15.226
TAKE SOME OF THE FOG OUT OF

02:32:15.292 --> 02:32:16.327
THEIR FUTURE.

02:32:16.393 --> 02:32:18.429
IT IS REALLY HARD TO MANAGER

02:32:18.496 --> 02:32:19.897
PROJECT WHEN YOUR FUTURE IS

02:32:19.964 --> 02:32:22.333
UNCERTAIN AND ANYTHING THE

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:24.034
LEGISLATURE CAN DO.

02:32:24.101 --> 02:32:25.903
HOWEVER IT MOVES TO CLARIFY THE

02:32:25.970 --> 02:32:27.605
FUTURE IN MAY AND BRING SOME

02:32:27.671 --> 02:32:29.874
DEFINITION I THINK WOULD BE VERY

02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:30.641
IMPORTANT.

02:32:30.708 --> 02:32:34.211
THANK YOU FIFTH.

02:32:34.278 --> 02:32:37.181
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LUKE -- STE

VOLUME THE QUESTIONS OF THE

02:32:37.815 --> 02:32:43.120
SPELL.

02:32:43.187 --> 02:32:47.691
THE NUMBER -- FOUR MR

02:32:47.758 --> 02:32:47.992
[inaudible]

02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:49.827
GREAT [inaudible]

02:32:49.894 --> 02:32:51.529
UP.

02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:52.897
I APOLOGIZE I I JUST THOUGHT OF

02:32:52.963 --> 02:32:53.864
ONE WHEN I HAD WHO'S GONNA LET

02:32:53.931 --> 02:32:58.302
THIS -- DILISIO ACTUALLY BUT I

02:32:58.369 --> 02:32:59.136
THINK YOU GAVE IT DID MISTER

02:32:59.203 --> 02:33:00.771
TIMES YOU GIVE AN INTERVIEW TO

02:33:00.838 --> 02:33:02.106
THEM.

02:33:02.172 --> 02:33:04.475
NEWS AWHILE BACK.

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:05.109
ABOUT THE FUTURE WHAT NEEDS TO

02:33:05.175 --> 02:33:06.977
BE DONE AND THAT WE NEEDED TO

02:33:07.044 --> 02:33:08.579
KIND OF GET A MORE CLEAR

02:33:08.646 --> 02:33:11.482
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT -- HAS TO

02:33:11.549 --> 02:33:13.217
AUTHORITIES PLANS FOR THE FUTURE

02:33:13.284 --> 02:33:14.685
DO YOU EVER THAT INTERVIEW I YES

02:33:14.752 --> 02:33:15.786
IT WAS ABOUT A ONE HOUR

02:33:15.853 --> 02:33:17.388
INTERVIEW FROM WHICH THEY

02:33:17.454 --> 02:33:18.756
CAREFULLY SELECTED ABOUT A

02:33:18.822 --> 02:33:22.626
MINUTE AND A HALF THE MEDIA

02:33:22.693 --> 02:33:24.461
ALWAYS AS A RIGHT.

02:33:24.528 --> 02:33:25.029
WELL MAYBE YOU CAN KIND OF

02:33:25.095 --> 02:33:26.130
SUMMARIZE THAN WHAT YOU REALLY

02:33:26.196 --> 02:33:26.997
MEANT TO SAY ARE MADE WAS IT

02:33:27.064 --> 02:33:28.232
TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT OR I THINK

02:33:28.299 --> 02:33:29.233
YOU YOU YOU HAD THERE'S A

02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:30.100
SPECIFIC QUOTE AND I DON'T HAVE

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:31.402
IN FRONT OF ME SO I APOLOGIZE.

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:33.370
ABOUT JUST TRYING TO KIND OF GET

02:33:33.437 --> 02:33:35.673
A CLEAR COMMITMENT FROM NICE TO

02:33:35.739 --> 02:33:37.308
AUTHORITY I JUST WHAT THEY'RE

02:33:37.374 --> 02:33:38.075
TRYING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:41.645
THE IF THAT BY SUMMATION WAS IS.

02:33:41.712 --> 02:33:42.680
IS INCORRECT PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

02:33:42.746 --> 02:33:44.381
I WOULD BE AFRAID TO SAY IT BUT

02:33:44.448 --> 02:33:46.350
I WILL ANYWAY I THINK THE MAIN

02:33:46.417 --> 02:33:48.819
POINT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:49.353
THAT.

02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:51.221
SOMETHING SOME ACTION NEEDS TO

02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:53.624
BE TAKEN THE THAT SOME DIRECTION

02:33:53.691 --> 02:33:55.726
FROM THE LEGISLATURE THAT SAYS

02:33:55.793 --> 02:33:58.395
DO THIS OR DO THIS OR FORM OF

02:33:58.462 --> 02:34:02.199
FORMER AND AGREED PLAN.

02:34:02.266 --> 02:34:03.767
IS REALLY CRUCIAL NOW -- AND

02:34:03.834 --> 02:34:05.703
THEN THE THROWAWAY REMARK THAT

02:34:05.769 --> 02:34:06.870
THEY CHOSE TO QUOTE BUT I

02:34:06.937 --> 02:34:07.871
BECAUSE IT MAKES PEOPLE NERVOUS

02:34:07.938 --> 02:34:08.806
IS.

02:34:08.872 --> 02:34:10.507
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO FIND

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:11.976
WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO DO

02:34:12.042 --> 02:34:13.310
THE QUESTION IS POLITICAL WILL

02:34:13.377 --> 02:34:15.212
IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF SOURCES

02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:16.614
OF FINANCING.

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:19.283
AND SO I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE

02:34:19.350 --> 02:34:20.618
IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL THAT THE

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:23.821
LEGISLATURE NOW HELP THE

02:34:23.887 --> 02:34:24.922
AUTHORITY AND THE GOVERNOR

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:25.222
[inaudible]

02:34:25.289 --> 02:34:26.690
DO SOMETHING.

02:34:26.757 --> 02:34:28.826
CLARIFIED AND DECIDE ON IT AND

02:34:28.892 --> 02:34:30.694
THEN STAND BEHIND IT I I I I

02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:33.163
THINK THE CRUCIAL PROBLEM THAT

02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:34.732
THIS PROJECT IS HAD FROM THE

02:34:34.798 --> 02:34:38.035
BEGINNING IS THAT IT WAS.

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:40.204
NOT CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE

02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:41.438
AND IT WAS NOT CLEARED BY THE

02:34:41.505 --> 02:34:43.707
LEGISLATURE IT WAS CREATED IN A

02:34:43.774 --> 02:34:46.410
SORT OF WISHFUL THINKING --

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:48.579
PROPOSITION AND WHICH SHOULD BE

02:34:48.646 --> 02:34:50.681
THE VISION WAS HERE IN THE

02:34:50.748 --> 02:34:52.216
BUDGET WAS HERE.

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:53.684
AND THEY WERE NOT BROUGHT

02:34:53.751 --> 02:34:55.686
TOGETHER IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

02:34:55.753 --> 02:34:56.987
NOW THEY NEED TO BE.

02:34:57.054 --> 02:34:58.889
M. I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND MY

02:34:58.956 --> 02:35:00.524
LAST QUESTION AND IT WAS FOR

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:02.026
BOTH IS THE IT WAS SINCE SINCE

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:03.861
YOU TESTIFIED LAST WEEK.

02:35:03.927 --> 02:35:05.262
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED

02:35:05.329 --> 02:35:06.397
ON THE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THEN

02:35:06.463 --> 02:35:08.032
I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING A FOR

02:35:08.098 --> 02:35:09.533
YOUR ENTIRE PRESENTATION.

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.902
BUT MAYBE BOTH YOU CAN CAN KIND

02:35:11.969 --> 02:35:14.004
OF SHARE -- AND NOW BEING

02:35:14.071 --> 02:35:15.673
FORWARD WITH EVERYTHING AND THAT

02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:17.174
HAS COME FROM -- THAT HAS

02:35:17.241 --> 02:35:18.876
OCCURRED WITH NOW THAT THE

02:35:18.942 --> 02:35:20.511
CALIFORNIA SUING RESEARCH LIKE

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:23.147
CARRIER SUING OR THE THE FEDERAL

02:35:23.213 --> 02:35:27.284
GOVERNMENT -- DOES IT PUT.

02:35:27.351 --> 02:35:29.853
THE UPDATE IN A NEW LIGHT I MEAN

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:30.921
IT IS THERE NOW JUST MORE

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:31.522
UNCERTAINTY.

02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:34.124
IS THERE IS IS IS THE UPDATE NOW

02:35:34.191 --> 02:35:35.959
A CREDIBLE DOCUMENT NOW KNOWING

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.861
MORE INFORMATION FOR WHAT

02:35:37.928 --> 02:35:40.631
HAPPENED FROM THE LAST WEEK.

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:42.499
SO IT SEEMS THAT IT DOES --

02:35:42.566 --> 02:35:43.901
ADDED AN EXTRA LAYER OF

02:35:43.967 --> 02:35:44.902
CHALLENGE CERTAINLY TO THE

02:35:44.968 --> 02:35:46.770
AUTHORITY ANYTIME THERE'S LESS

02:35:46.837 --> 02:35:48.839
MONEY AVAILABLE THAT'S THAT'S

02:35:48.906 --> 02:35:50.474
NOT A GOOD THING FOR THE PROJECT --

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:52.810
FUNDAMENTALLY A BILLION DOLLARS

02:35:52.876 --> 02:35:54.211
PROBABLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

02:35:54.278 --> 02:35:56.547
WHOLE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW THAT'S

02:35:56.613 --> 02:35:59.950
NOT -- THAT'S NOT I STAYED

02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:01.351
PARTICULARLY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

02:36:01.418 --> 02:36:02.052
EIGHT TO COST OF THE ENTIRE

02:36:02.119 --> 02:36:02.886
PROJECT BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

02:36:02.953 --> 02:36:04.021
ABOUT A PROJECT THAT'S PROBABLY

02:36:04.088 --> 02:36:05.823
AT LEAST SEVENTY NINE BILLION

02:36:05.889 --> 02:36:07.257
DOLLARS IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF

02:36:07.324 --> 02:36:09.660
THESE ONE NOW -- BUT CERTAINLY

02:36:09.727 --> 02:36:11.195
EVERY BILLION DOLLARS I MEAN

02:36:11.261 --> 02:36:12.463
THAT'S THAT'S SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:36:12.529 --> 02:36:13.764
OF MONEY AND THAT'S MONEY THAT

02:36:13.831 --> 02:36:14.665
COULD GO TO OTHER KINDS OF

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:16.133
PRIORITIES IS LEGISLATURE'S VERY

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.568
INTERESTED AND SO.

02:36:17.634 --> 02:36:19.002
I THINK IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW NOT

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:20.671
GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:36:20.738 --> 02:36:23.006
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE PROJECT --

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:24.341
AND I THINK IT IS ME YOU KNOW

02:36:24.408 --> 02:36:26.677
MAYBE ONE WHEN YOU KNOW EXTRA

02:36:26.744 --> 02:36:28.245
REASON WHY IT'S IT'S WORTH A

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:29.747
SORT OF HAVING THIS CONVERSATION

02:36:29.813 --> 02:36:31.615
ABOUT -- WE WHAT IS THE

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:33.484
LEGISLATURE'S VISION FOR THE

02:36:33.550 --> 02:36:35.452
PROJECT HOW MUCH MONEY ON DOES

02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:36.954
THE STATE WANT TO COMMIT -- TO

02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:39.056
THIS PROJECT GIVEN GIVEN

02:36:39.123 --> 02:36:42.159
UNCERTAINTIES AT THE FEDERAL

02:36:42.226 --> 02:36:45.996
LEVEL -- I HAVE TO QUOTE.

02:36:46.063 --> 02:36:47.364
SENATOR EVERETT MCKINLEY DIRKSEN

02:36:47.431 --> 02:36:48.732
WHO SAID ONCE A BILLION DOLLARS

02:36:48.799 --> 02:36:51.101
HERE BILLION DOLLARS THERE

02:36:51.168 --> 02:36:51.668
PRETTY SOON YOU'VE GOT REAL

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:55.005
MONEY -- IT DOES ADD TO THE

02:36:55.072 --> 02:36:56.840
UNCERTAINTIES THAT'S FOR SURE --

02:36:56.907 --> 02:36:58.876
BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE GREATEST

02:36:58.942 --> 02:37:00.711
UNCERTAINTY ALL OF THESE STATE

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:03.514
COSTS IN THE THE POTENTIAL

02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:05.549
SCHEDULES AND THE RETENTION OF

02:37:05.616 --> 02:37:07.251
FEDERAL MONEY -- THERE ALSO

02:37:07.317 --> 02:37:08.552
OBJECT.

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:10.154
TO AS WE SAID A WIDE RANGE OF

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:14.124
UNCERTAINTY -- AND I THINK THAT

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:15.726
THAT IT CERTAINLY.

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:16.794
COULD WORK OUT.

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:20.364
FAVORABLY -- BUT IT MIGHT NOT

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:21.732
AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

02:37:21.799 --> 02:37:24.201
SHOULD BE PREPARED AND THINK

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.502
ABOUT NINE ONLY.

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:27.337
HOPING FOR THE BEST FOR PLANNING

02:37:27.404 --> 02:37:28.806
FOR THE WORST WHAT DO WE DO IF

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:30.808
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH FURTHER

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:32.442
PROBLEMS WITH THE COST -- BUT TO

02:37:32.509 --> 02:37:34.945
SCHEDULE OR OR WITH THROUGH THE

02:37:35.012 --> 02:37:36.580
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT AND HOW DO

02:37:36.647 --> 02:37:38.015
WE HANDLE THIS PROBLEM MISTER

02:37:38.081 --> 02:37:39.783
FRAZIER STARTED OFF BY SAYING

02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:42.152
THIS COULD BE A ROUGH RIDE WE

02:37:42.219 --> 02:37:43.420
SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT.

02:37:43.487 --> 02:37:45.088
I I APPRECIATE THE THE

02:37:45.155 --> 02:37:46.957
CHAIRMAN'S PATIENTS AND I I

02:37:47.024 --> 02:37:48.425
AGREE WITH THIS CHAMBERS ELSE'S

02:37:48.492 --> 02:37:50.394
AND YOURS IT'S IT'S THAT.

02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:51.094
HOLISTICALLY STAKING A STEP BACK.

02:37:51.161 --> 02:37:52.496
THE BILLION DOLLARS IS ONE THING

02:37:52.563 --> 02:37:54.131
BUT THEN YOU ADD AND EVERYTHING

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:56.834
ELSE WITH THE THE ER'S IN THE

02:37:56.900 --> 02:37:58.669
POTENTIAL FUTURE COSTS OF A RUNS

02:37:58.735 --> 02:37:59.903
AND THE NEED FOR MORE

02:37:59.970 --> 02:38:01.505
PROFESSIONAL APPROVALS AND

02:38:01.572 --> 02:38:03.774
RIDERSHIP -- RIDERSHIP --

02:38:03.841 --> 02:38:05.909
CHALLENGES AND ALL THOSE THINGS

02:38:05.976 --> 02:38:07.511
IS A WE CAN'T LOOK AT EVERYTHING

02:38:07.578 --> 02:38:09.646
THROUGH A SILO -- TO A STRAW WE

02:38:09.713 --> 02:38:11.281
NEED TO LOOK AT IT FOR WITH WITH

02:38:11.348 --> 02:38:12.716
KIND OF A THREE THOUSAND FOOT

02:38:12.783 --> 02:38:14.518
LEVEL SO I APPRECIATE YOUR

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:20.257
ANALYSIS AND AND CANDOR THINK

02:38:20.324 --> 02:38:22.426
INSTRUMENT.

02:38:22.492 --> 02:38:24.628
THANK YOU MISTER FONG HELEN --

02:38:24.695 --> 02:38:25.495
AS THE FUNDING PLAN RELIES

02:38:25.562 --> 02:38:26.563
HEAVILY ON THE FUTURE CAP AND

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:27.764
TRADE REVENUES.

02:38:27.831 --> 02:38:28.999
HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU IN THE

02:38:29.066 --> 02:38:29.666
ESTIMATES CLOTHING IN THIS PLAN

02:38:29.733 --> 02:38:31.368
BASED ON -- THERE'S A PUSH TO

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:33.203
ACTUALLY INCREASE THE COST OF

02:38:33.270 --> 02:38:35.138
THE AUCTION.

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:36.773
A PER METRIC TON.

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:38.609
AND THE WILLINGNESS OF INDUSTRY

02:38:38.675 --> 02:38:41.979
TO ACTUALLY ACCEPT THAT.

02:38:42.045 --> 02:38:43.380
SO CERTAINLY THE ESTIMATES THAT

02:38:43.447 --> 02:38:44.915
THEY PUT FORWARD SEEM REASONABLE

02:38:44.982 --> 02:38:46.783
AT THIS POINT HOWEVER I THINK

02:38:46.850 --> 02:38:47.985
OUR OFFICES NOTED.

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:49.519
THERE IS JUST UNCERTAINTY WITH

02:38:49.586 --> 02:38:50.821
REGARD TO CAP AND TRADE REVENUES

02:38:50.888 --> 02:38:53.023
AND I THINK YOU HIGHLIGHTED ONE

02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.724
ASPECT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT

02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:56.526
THEY'RE PROBABLY A VARIETY OF OF

02:38:56.593 --> 02:38:57.361
THINGS THAT ARE MAKING THOSE

02:38:57.427 --> 02:38:59.696
REVENUES ON CERTAIN AND SO.

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:00.764
I THINK THAT'S ONE CHALLENGED

02:39:00.831 --> 02:39:02.466
THE AUTHORITY FACES IS THAT IT'S

02:39:02.532 --> 02:39:04.134
CURRENTLY RELYING ON A SOURCE OF

02:39:04.201 --> 02:39:07.571
REVENUE -- BADTHAT IS SUBJECT

02:39:07.638 --> 02:39:09.072
TO THAT UNCERTAINTY AND AND IS

02:39:09.139 --> 02:39:11.608
ALSO ONLY APPROVE THREE TWENTY

02:39:11.675 --> 02:39:13.176
THIRTY SO -- THAT'S CERTAINLY A

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:15.012
CHALLENGE AND I THINK NO ONE CAN

02:39:15.078 --> 02:39:16.713
BE COMPLETELY CONFIDENT IN THOSE

02:39:16.780 --> 02:39:19.983
NUMBERS JUST BECAUSE OF THAT IN

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:22.552
HERE AND UNCERTAINTY.

02:39:22.619 --> 02:39:23.086
THANK YOU I HAVE ONE MORE

02:39:23.153 --> 02:39:24.621
QUESTION FOR YOU.

02:39:24.688 --> 02:39:25.222
HI IT IS THE ONLY -- HAVE ANY

02:39:25.289 --> 02:39:25.856
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL

02:39:25.923 --> 02:39:26.990
OVERSIGHT MEASURES THAT COULD BE

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:30.193
TAKEN -- BY THE LEGISLATURE OR

02:39:30.260 --> 02:39:33.997
THE ADMINISTRATION THE AUTHORITY.

02:39:34.064 --> 02:39:35.265
SO WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH

02:39:35.332 --> 02:39:36.767
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT

02:39:36.833 --> 02:39:38.001
AREA BUT I WOULD SAY JUST A

02:39:38.068 --> 02:39:39.670
COUPLE OF THINGS MAYBE FOR THE

02:39:39.736 --> 02:39:40.737
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER I THINK

02:39:40.804 --> 02:39:42.306
HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE ARE

02:39:42.372 --> 02:39:43.807
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OVERSIGHT

02:39:43.874 --> 02:39:44.574
AND SO.

02:39:44.641 --> 02:39:46.009
REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE

02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:47.744
PUTTING THIS HEARING ON I THINK

02:39:47.811 --> 02:39:50.247
THIS IS BEEN VERY VERY VALUABLE

02:39:50.314 --> 02:39:51.148
AND I THINK THIS TYPE OF

02:39:51.214 --> 02:39:52.549
ACTIVITY IS IS A REALLY

02:39:52.616 --> 02:39:55.085
IMPORTANT PART -- ALSO I

02:39:55.152 --> 02:39:57.287
TARGETED REPORTING CAN BE REALLY

02:39:57.354 --> 02:39:58.855
HELPFUL THERE THAT ALREADY

02:39:58.922 --> 02:40:01.258
PROVIDES A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON

02:40:01.325 --> 02:40:03.493
SOMETIMES I THINK THE CHALLENGES

02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:04.328
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:05.529
ARE THERE IN A WAY THAT THE

02:40:05.595 --> 02:40:07.297
LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY DIGEST I

02:40:07.364 --> 02:40:08.465
KNOW THEY'VE MADE SOME EFFORTS

02:40:08.532 --> 02:40:10.000
AND NOT IN THAT REGARD AND I

02:40:10.067 --> 02:40:11.168
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY STILL

02:40:11.234 --> 02:40:12.936
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:13.537
TO WORK TOWARDS I KNOW MISTER

02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:14.604
THOMPSON'S ALSO BEEN VERY VERY

02:40:14.671 --> 02:40:16.206
INVOLVED IN THAT -- I THINK

02:40:16.273 --> 02:40:17.541
THAT'S ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE

02:40:17.607 --> 02:40:19.409
THAT HELPS THE LEGISLATURE

02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:21.411
CONDUCT ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE -- I

02:40:21.478 --> 02:40:22.579
JUST A COUPLE OTHER THINGS

02:40:22.646 --> 02:40:24.147
POTENTIALLY TO THINK ABOUT

02:40:24.214 --> 02:40:24.982
THOUGH I THINK AS WE MOVE

02:40:25.048 --> 02:40:26.883
FORWARD ONE IS SORT OF THE

02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:27.784
FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THE

02:40:27.851 --> 02:40:29.853
PROJECT SO A LOT OF THE FUNDING

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:32.289
AS WE MENTIONED -- PREVIOUSLY IS

02:40:32.356 --> 02:40:34.191
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED CAP

02:40:34.257 --> 02:40:36.259
AND TRADE FUNDS -- OUR OFFICE IS

02:40:36.326 --> 02:40:38.061
NOTED IN THE PAST THAT CONTINUES

02:40:38.128 --> 02:40:39.796
APPROPRIATIONS DON'T GIVE THE

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:40.931
LEGISLATURE QUITE AS MUCH

02:40:40.998 --> 02:40:43.033
OVERSIGHT IS A TRADITIONAL KIND

02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:45.302
OF APPROPRIATIONS SO THERE'S A

02:40:45.369 --> 02:40:47.037
TRADE OFF THEIR YOU KNOW IF IT

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:47.471
WERE.

02:40:47.537 --> 02:40:48.872
DONE IN ANOTHER MANNER THAT WE

02:40:48.939 --> 02:40:50.540
GIVE PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:40:50.607 --> 02:40:52.109
OVERSIGHT TO THE BUDGET PROCESS

02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:53.944
WHICH CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:55.779
THE LEGISLATURE -- AND THEN

02:40:55.846 --> 02:40:57.114
ANOTHER THING JUST TO TO THINK

02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:59.182
ABOUT IS SORT OF THE GOVERNANCE

02:40:59.249 --> 02:41:00.684
STRUCTURE I KNOW THIS IS

02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:02.085
SOMETHING THAT DAY -- YOU OF

02:41:02.152 --> 02:41:03.086
ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT ASSEMBLY

02:41:03.153 --> 02:41:04.955
MEMBER BUT THE GOVERNMENT

02:41:05.022 --> 02:41:05.789
STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THAT'S

02:41:05.856 --> 02:41:07.657
PROVIDING SUFFICIENT --

02:41:07.724 --> 02:41:08.992
OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S

02:41:09.059 --> 02:41:11.294
PERSPECTIVE WE HAVEN'T DONE AYE

02:41:11.361 --> 02:41:12.829
AYE AND IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:14.464
THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW

02:41:14.531 --> 02:41:15.532
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT THE

02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:17.601
LEGISLATURE CAN DO BUT SOMETIMES

02:41:17.667 --> 02:41:19.036
IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE THESE OTHER

02:41:19.102 --> 02:41:21.104
ENTITIES LIKE THAT LIKE THE

02:41:21.171 --> 02:41:21.872
BOARD.

02:41:21.938 --> 02:41:23.173
LIKE THE PEER REVIEW GROUP --

02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:24.041
PROVIDING ANOTHER LAYER OF

02:41:24.107 --> 02:41:25.575
OVERSIGHT AND SO I THINK REALLY

02:41:25.642 --> 02:41:27.110
THINKING THROUGH ARE WE GETTING

02:41:27.177 --> 02:41:28.378
THE LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT WE NEED

02:41:28.445 --> 02:41:30.080
FROM THOSE ENTITIES AND IF NOT

02:41:30.147 --> 02:41:35.185
WHAT SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AND

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:36.987
WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO IN A

02:41:37.054 --> 02:41:38.488
DIFFERENT WAY OR OR HOW IT HAS

02:41:38.555 --> 02:41:39.156
TO BE THING ABOUT THE STRUCTURE.

02:41:39.222 --> 02:41:40.190
SO WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.324
DETAILS OF THAT BUT CERTAINLY

02:41:41.391 --> 02:41:41.992
THINK THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF BY

02:41:42.059 --> 02:41:42.659
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT SHOULD

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:44.261
BE EXPLORED MORE IN CONSIDERED

02:41:44.327 --> 02:41:45.529
MORE AS A LEGISLATURE MOVES

02:41:45.595 --> 02:41:46.663
FORWARD AND TRIES TO GRAPPLE

02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:48.465
WITH HOW TO GET OVERSIGHT OVER.

02:41:48.532 --> 02:41:51.668
A VERY COMPLEX VERY COSTLY A

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:56.139
DYNAMIC PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS.

02:41:56.206 --> 02:41:56.740
ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN A AS YOU

02:41:56.807 --> 02:41:58.408
KNOW WE'VE WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS

02:41:58.475 --> 02:42:00.210
ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT AND A NUMBER

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:01.812
OF REPORTS THAT WE'VE HAD BUT

02:42:01.878 --> 02:42:02.879
BECAUSE OF WHAT.

02:42:02.946 --> 02:42:04.848
WE THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:06.249
THERE THERE REALLY ARE THREE

02:42:06.316 --> 02:42:07.984
ISSUES ONE IS THE LOCATION OF

02:42:08.051 --> 02:42:10.454
THE OVERSIGHT AGENCY SO YOU CAN

02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:11.788
BE SURE.

02:42:11.855 --> 02:42:13.256
THAT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT.

02:42:13.323 --> 02:42:15.692
THE OTHER THE SECOND IS ADVOCACY

02:42:15.759 --> 02:42:16.893
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:19.729
RESOURCES YOU HAVE NO HOPE OF

02:42:19.796 --> 02:42:20.964
DEALING WITH THE PROGRAM THIS

02:42:21.031 --> 02:42:22.132
LARGE.

02:42:22.199 --> 02:42:25.902
THE THIRD ONE AND I STRESS THIS

02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:28.038
IS CONTINUITY -- IT IS THERE IS

02:42:28.105 --> 02:42:28.872
A REAL DANGER TO HAVE OF HAVING

02:42:28.939 --> 02:42:30.373
OVERSIGHT OF HAVING STAFF

02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:32.542
CHANGES EVERY YEAR AND IF YOU

02:42:32.609 --> 02:42:33.877
HAVEN'T BEEN THERE LONG ENOUGH

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:36.046
TO REMEMBER WHAT YOU WERE TOLD

02:42:36.113 --> 02:42:37.614
TWO YEARS AGO AND THERE'S NO WAY

02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:40.650
YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES.

02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:42.752
SO OF THERE WOULD BE A ANY ONE

02:42:42.819 --> 02:42:43.954
OF A NUMBER OF WAYS YOU COULD DO

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:46.323
THIS ONE WE HAVE OFTEN SUGGESTED

02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:48.391
IS SPECIAL UNIT IN LA -- WITH

02:42:48.458 --> 02:42:50.026
THE RIGHT RESOURCES IN

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:51.461
CONTINUITY DO IT.

02:42:51.528 --> 02:42:52.696
BUT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER YOU IF

02:42:52.762 --> 02:42:54.865
YOU YOU NEED TO PROVIDE ALL

02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:56.299
THREE OF THOSE ELEMENTS IF IF

02:42:56.366 --> 02:42:58.401
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE REALLY GOOD

02:42:58.468 --> 02:43:00.137
PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AND

02:43:00.203 --> 02:43:02.639
ADVICE TO YOU AND WHAT YOU'RE

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:03.807
DOING.

02:43:03.874 --> 02:43:05.442
I APPRECIATE THAT SO THAT SAID

02:43:05.509 --> 02:43:09.246
WAS INTO YOUR QUESTIONS WITH --

02:43:09.312 --> 02:43:09.846
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL

02:43:09.913 --> 02:43:10.680
HERE.

02:43:10.747 --> 02:43:11.681
WHO WAS A PEER REVIEW GROUP

02:43:11.748 --> 02:43:13.016
CONSULTED ON THE NEW CENTRAL

02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:14.417
VALLEY LINE PLAN ON RIDERSHIP

02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:15.752
ESTIMATES?

02:43:15.819 --> 02:43:18.221
COST ESTIMATES AND THEN FARE

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:20.023
COSTS.

02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:22.092
ARE A MEMBER OF THE PEER REVIEW

02:43:22.159 --> 02:43:24.060
GROUP STACEY MORTENSEN WAS

02:43:24.127 --> 02:43:26.129
INVOLVED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS I

02:43:26.196 --> 02:43:27.564
I WILL DEFER TO HER.

02:43:27.631 --> 02:43:30.133
BECAUSE SHE WILL BE APPEARING IN

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:31.468
A MINUTE ON THAT OKAY WAS

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:33.470
INVOLVED IN THIS DISCUSSION MY

02:43:33.537 --> 02:43:34.471
PREVIOUS.

COST ESTIMATES FOR THE CENTRAL

02:43:39.476 --> 02:43:40.777
VALLEY.

02:43:40.844 --> 02:43:42.879
ALL RIGHTS I DO I THINK WE SORT

02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:43.847
OF DEALT WITH THAT BY SAYING IT

02:43:43.914 --> 02:43:45.081
NEEDS A LOT MORE WORK I I'M NOT

02:43:45.148 --> 02:43:46.383
SAYING THEY'RE WRONG I JUST

02:43:46.449 --> 02:43:47.450
THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:43:47.517 --> 02:43:49.152
DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED

02:43:49.219 --> 02:43:50.453
OUT A LOT OF MORE QUESTIONS THAT

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:50.954
HAVE TO BE.

02:43:51.021 --> 02:43:55.125
ASKED IN THIS CONTEXT -- BEFORE

02:43:55.192 --> 02:43:56.393
WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT THE

02:43:56.459 --> 02:43:57.994
NUMBERS ARE TELLING US WHAT WE

02:43:58.061 --> 02:43:59.930
NEED TO HEAR.

02:43:59.996 --> 02:44:01.064
I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK WHEN

02:44:01.131 --> 02:44:02.699
WE HAD THE HEARING WITH THE

02:44:02.766 --> 02:44:07.537
STATE ORDER OF GO BACK A YEAR

02:44:07.604 --> 02:44:09.039
NOW FOR TWO YEARS YOUR BILL

02:44:09.105 --> 02:44:09.339
[inaudible]

02:44:09.406 --> 02:44:10.640
A SMALL.

02:44:10.707 --> 02:44:11.575
A ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED

02:44:11.641 --> 02:44:13.443
OF THE AUDITOR IS THE MANAGEMENT

02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:16.046
TEAM QUALIFIED FOR THIS PROJECT

02:44:16.112 --> 02:44:17.981
DO WE HAVE CERTAINTY THAT WE

02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:18.882
KNOW.

02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:20.984
OF THAT -- EVERYBODY IN THERE

02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:22.252
HAS ACTUALLY.

02:44:22.319 --> 02:44:23.687
OF THE ABILITY.

02:44:23.753 --> 02:44:26.523
TO MANAGE THESE CONSULTANTS AND

02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:28.358
THE AND THE AND THIS THE

02:44:28.425 --> 02:44:29.793
SUBCONTRACTORS GOING FORWARD.

02:44:29.859 --> 02:44:31.394
HAVE YOU HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY

02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:34.231
SAYS SENT TO LOOK AT THAT A

02:44:34.297 --> 02:44:36.700
QUESTION.

02:44:36.766 --> 02:44:38.134
ME THINK ABOUT HOW TO ANSWER

02:44:38.201 --> 02:44:39.102
THAT QUESTION.

02:44:39.169 --> 02:44:41.037
UP I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:44.007
BUT WHAT THEY HAVE [inaudible]

02:44:44.074 --> 02:44:45.775
COMPETENT [inaudible]

02:44:45.842 --> 02:44:47.510
FASHIONABLE PEOPLE.

02:44:47.577 --> 02:44:50.013
WHO CAN MANAGE THIS JOB I THINK

02:44:50.080 --> 02:44:52.048
THE QUESTION IS?

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:53.783
HOW SOON DO THEY LEARN EXACTLY

02:44:53.850 --> 02:44:55.619
WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND HOW TO

02:44:55.685 --> 02:44:57.754
PUT THE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO

02:44:57.821 --> 02:44:59.990
MANAGE THE PROJECT?

02:45:00.056 --> 02:45:01.391
I THINK THAT HAS THAT WAS A

02:45:01.458 --> 02:45:03.660
PROBLEM AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE

02:45:03.727 --> 02:45:05.996
THEY STARTED WITH WITH TWO OR

02:45:06.062 --> 02:45:09.432
THREE STATE EMPLOYEES IN TWO OR

02:45:09.499 --> 02:45:10.300
THREE HUNDRED CONSULTANTS AND

02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:12.202
THAT IS NO WAY TO RUN A PROJECT

02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:13.436
LIKE THIS.

02:45:13.503 --> 02:45:14.804
I THINK THE PROPOSAL'S NOW TO

02:45:14.871 --> 02:45:16.473
SHIFT THAT BALANCE MORE TOWARDS

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:18.074
STATE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE

02:45:18.141 --> 02:45:19.776
AUTHORITY TO RIVER WORK FOR THE

02:45:19.843 --> 02:45:22.112
STATE AND I THINK THE FACT THAT

02:45:22.178 --> 02:45:23.913
THEY'VE GAINED EXPERIENCE OFTEN

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:24.981
PAINFULLY BUT THEY'VE GAINED

02:45:25.048 --> 02:45:26.850
EXPERIENCE IN THE WE'RE GETTING

02:45:26.916 --> 02:45:28.418
A LOT CLOSER TO HAVING.

02:45:28.485 --> 02:45:31.721
AN ORGANIZATION IN PLACE THAT

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:33.823
CAN BEGIN TO HANDLE THESE FROM --

02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:35.425
SO IT'S IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION

02:45:35.492 --> 02:45:36.926
OF YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND THE

02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:38.328
PEOPLE THE QUESTION IS HOW DO

02:45:38.395 --> 02:45:40.030

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:41.464

AND SO I THINK WE'VE HAD A A

02:47:25.902 --> 02:47:27.570
GOOD DOSE OF THAT.

02:47:27.637 --> 02:47:28.671
OUR AGENCY HAS BEEN PLANNING ON

02:47:28.738 --> 02:47:30.673
A PASSENGER RAIL HUB FERBER SAID

02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:32.409
SINCE THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES

02:47:32.475 --> 02:47:34.711
SO LONG BEFORE HIGH SPEED RAIL.

02:47:34.778 --> 02:47:36.112
THIS REALLY ON THE SCENE AND ON

02:47:36.179 --> 02:47:37.213
THE MAP IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:38.381
PROGRAM OR SAID WAS VERY

02:47:38.448 --> 02:47:40.083
IMPORTANT TO THEM THE VALLEY

02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:41.718
COUNTY IS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON

02:47:41.785 --> 02:47:43.820
EXPANDING RAIL SERVICE.

02:47:43.887 --> 02:47:44.788
WITH THE APPROVAL OF PROP ONE A

02:47:44.854 --> 02:47:46.055
THOUGH AMBER SAID STATION IN

02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:47.824
PHASE ONE OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:47:47.891 --> 02:47:49.259
PROGRAM MADE THAT A MORE

02:47:49.325 --> 02:47:51.961
CRITICAL HUB.

02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:53.363
IN OUR MINDS AND IN OUR PLANNING.

02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:54.864
AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT SOME

02:47:54.931 --> 02:47:57.267
AB BOUNCING BALLS OF THE

02:47:57.333 --> 02:47:58.835
BUSINESS PLANTS THE MERCED

02:47:58.902 --> 02:48:00.503
STATION AS BOUNCED IN AND OUT OF

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:03.106
IT AND WE HAVE RALLIED TO TRY TO

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:05.208
SUPPORT MERCED AND WE'VE AGREED

02:48:05.275 --> 02:48:06.309
TO SUPPORT GOING TO SOUTHERN

02:48:06.376 --> 02:48:07.844
CALIFORNIA WHEN THAT SEEM TO BE

02:48:07.911 --> 02:48:09.245
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE

02:48:09.312 --> 02:48:09.879
STATE.

02:48:09.946 --> 02:48:12.081
BUT OUR CLOSE WORKING GROUP IN

02:48:12.148 --> 02:48:13.550
THE VALLEY OF COUNTIES WOULD

02:48:13.616 --> 02:48:14.951
NEVER FALTERED IN MAKING OUR

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:16.052
PROGRESS.

02:48:16.119 --> 02:48:18.388
TOWARDS ENHANCING PASSENGER RAIL

02:48:18.455 --> 02:48:19.722
TO MERCED.

02:48:19.789 --> 02:48:21.157
WE ARE ALREADY IN THE PLANNING

02:48:21.224 --> 02:48:23.626
PROCESS AND ENGINEERING PROCESS

02:48:23.693 --> 02:48:25.128
OF PHASING NEW SERVICE DOWN TO

02:48:25.195 --> 02:48:26.729
MERCED FROM THE EXISTING A

02:48:26.796 --> 02:48:27.931
STRUGGLING.

02:48:27.997 --> 02:48:29.933
HOWEVER THE POTENTIAL ARRIVAL OF

02:48:29.999 --> 02:48:31.868
AN IN THE INITIAL SEGMENT OF

02:48:31.935 --> 02:48:33.203
HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE.

02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:34.938
CREATES A NEW INTEGRATION THAT

02:48:35.004 --> 02:48:36.506
WILL INCREASE RIDERSHIP ON

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:38.208
NUMEROUS CONNECTING SERVICES AS

02:48:38.274 --> 02:48:40.443
WELL AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:41.244
SEGMENT.

02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:42.679
THE AUTHORITY DID DISCUSS WITH

02:48:42.745 --> 02:48:44.347
US THE MERCED CONNECTION IN

02:48:44.414 --> 02:48:46.583
ADVANCE OF RELEASING THAT

02:48:46.649 --> 02:48:49.552
PROJECT UPDATE REPORT.

02:48:49.619 --> 02:48:50.887
AND THEY SUGGESTED THERE'S

02:48:50.954 --> 02:48:52.121
VARIOUS SCENARIOS -- THE SERVICE

02:48:52.188 --> 02:48:53.723
AREAS WE CAN ANALYZE TOGETHER TO

02:48:53.790 --> 02:48:55.525
MAXIMIZE THE ATTRACTIVENESS TO

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:57.460
THE TRAVELER ACROSS ALL OF THE

02:48:57.527 --> 02:48:59.596
SYSTEMS AND SO I THINK THE

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:01.297
OPERATIVE PHRASE THERE WAS SOME

02:49:01.364 --> 02:49:04.133
FUTURE ANALYSIS TO REALLY TRY TO

02:49:04.200 --> 02:49:06.035
PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER.

02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:07.270
IN MY DIFFERENT ROLES I SEE A

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:10.139
MODEL NEEDED NOT THE OLD ONE NOT

02:49:10.206 --> 02:49:11.641
THE ONE THAT IS TEAMS NOT

02:49:11.708 --> 02:49:14.277
CAPABLE OF OF LOOKING AT AT THE

02:49:14.344 --> 02:49:16.246
NEW SERVICE SCENARIOS I THINK WE

02:49:16.312 --> 02:49:17.814
NEED A NEW MODEL WE NEED TO

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.449
INVEST IN AND NEW MODEL.

02:49:19.516 --> 02:49:20.950
AND I WOULD ARGUE WE NEED TO

02:49:21.017 --> 02:49:23.152
SIMULTANEOUSLY.

02:49:23.219 --> 02:49:25.288
WHAT TRAVEL TIME OPTIONS ARE

02:49:25.355 --> 02:49:27.757
AVAILABLE WHAT DIFFERENT CLASSES

02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:30.760
OF ON BOARD SERVICE IS AVAILABLE?

02:49:30.827 --> 02:49:32.428
WHAT ARE THE TRAIN SPEEDS DO WE

02:49:32.495 --> 02:49:34.163
HAVE REGULAR STOP AND EXPRESS

02:49:34.230 --> 02:49:36.165
SERVICE WHAT ARE THE FARE LEVELS

02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:37.700
WHAT ARE THE -- OPERATIONS AND

02:49:37.767 --> 02:49:40.904
MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED

02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:41.938
WITH DIFFERENT TRAIN SPEEDS.

02:49:42.005 --> 02:49:43.806
THE ROUTE IS BEING BUILT TO PROP

02:49:43.873 --> 02:49:45.608
ONE A STANDARDS AND CAPABLE OF

02:49:45.675 --> 02:49:47.210
SUSTAINING TWO HUNDRED MILE AN

02:49:47.277 --> 02:49:48.611
HOUR TRAINS.

02:49:48.678 --> 02:49:50.079
BUT THERE'S LIKELY A DIFFERENT

02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:51.381
SWEET SPOT.

02:49:51.447 --> 02:49:53.583
THAT WE CAN FIND THAT WOULD DIAL

02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:55.351
IN THE SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS

02:49:55.418 --> 02:49:57.487
IN THE MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY FOR

02:49:57.554 --> 02:49:58.788
A RAMP UP PERIOD AND MY

02:49:58.855 --> 02:49:59.923
UNDERSTANDING.

02:49:59.989 --> 02:50:01.524
THROUGH OTHER SYSTEMS AND EVEN

02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:03.426
THROUGH THIS PROCESS WAS THAT

02:50:03.493 --> 02:50:04.727
THERE WAS ALWAYS A RAMP UP

02:50:04.794 --> 02:50:06.863
PERIOD TO TEST OUT WHAT'S THE

02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:08.064
BEST SPEED TO RUN OUT.

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:08.898
WHAT'S THE BEST SERVICE

02:50:08.965 --> 02:50:12.802
CHARACTERISTICS TO ACHIEVE THAT --

I'D REALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT.

03:02:41.450 --> 03:02:44.153

PINCH HITTER FIRST BASEMAN THIRD

03:02:45.754 --> 03:02:48.357
BASEMAN WHO HAS A A CONTRACT

WITH THE GIANTS THAT DOESN'T

03:02:52.294 --> 03:02:54.163
COST THE GIANTS VERY MUCH.

03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:55.064

03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:56.565
YOU REALLY NEED IT.

03:02:56.632 --> 03:02:57.666
AND I THINK -- HIGH SPEED RAILS

03:02:57.733 --> 03:02:59.435
INVESTMENT IS A FUNDING PARTNER

03:02:59.501 --> 03:03:00.869
IN THE ELECTRIFICATION FOR

03:03:00.936 --> 03:03:02.104
CALTRAIN.

03:03:02.171 --> 03:03:03.772
TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER FUNDS

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:06.342
WITH ACCUMULATED INCLUDING SIX

03:03:06.408 --> 03:03:07.276

03:03:07.843 --> 03:03:09.044
GOVERNMENT.

03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:11.647
IS A HOME RUN SO HOME RUN FOR

03:03:11.714 --> 03:03:13.015
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

03:03:13.082 --> 03:03:14.616
IS A HOME RUN FOR CALTRAIN

03:03:14.683 --> 03:03:16.585
BECAUSE OF THE LACK FOR CATION

03:03:16.652 --> 03:03:18.187
PROJECT CALTRAIN IS THE HAS

03:03:18.253 --> 03:03:19.722
GROWN TO BE THE SEVENTH LARGEST

03:03:19.788 --> 03:03:21.357
COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM.

03:03:21.423 --> 03:03:23.125
IN THE COUNTRY -- WE ON THE

03:03:23.192 --> 03:03:25.094
RIGHT AWAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO

03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:27.363
SAN JOSE AND WE USE A UNION

03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:29.665
PACIFIC RIGHT AWAY FROM SAN JOSE

03:03:29.732 --> 03:03:31.467
TO GILROY UNDER AT LIMITED

03:03:31.533 --> 03:03:33.302
TRACKAGE RIGHTS AGREEMENT.

03:03:33.369 --> 03:03:34.203
SINCE THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

03:03:34.269 --> 03:03:36.305
WHO WE'VE ALMOST TRIPLED IN

03:03:36.372 --> 03:03:38.273
RIDERSHIP -- BUT THE

03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:40.409
ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT HAS BEEN

03:03:40.476 --> 03:03:42.878
A DREAM OF THE CALTRAIN SYSTEM

03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:45.247
SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN

03:03:45.314 --> 03:03:46.248
NINETIES.

03:03:46.315 --> 03:03:46.882
BUT IT'S NOT UNTIL THAT HOME RUN

03:03:46.949 --> 03:03:49.084
WAS HIT THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY

03:03:49.151 --> 03:03:51.720
DO IT THAT IS THE OF PUTTING

03:03:51.787 --> 03:03:53.389
TOGETHER OF THE ACCUMULATION OF

03:03:53.455 --> 03:03:55.324
FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING THE IT

03:03:55.391 --> 03:03:57.626
CRITICAL INVESTMENT FROM.

03:03:57.693 --> 03:03:59.294
HIGH SPEED RAIL -- TO PUT

03:03:59.361 --> 03:04:01.096
TOGETHER THE BUDGET TO ALLOW US

03:04:01.163 --> 03:04:02.598
TO ELECTRIFY TO BECOME A CLEAN

03:04:02.664 --> 03:04:03.999
SYSTEM.

03:04:04.066 --> 03:04:06.235
A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM -- A

03:04:06.301 --> 03:04:08.170
BETTER SYSTEM ON IN TERMS OF ITS

03:04:08.237 --> 03:04:10.172
OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS IN A

03:04:10.239 --> 03:04:13.008
SYSTEM THAT IS GOING -- TO ALLOW

03:04:13.075 --> 03:04:15.611
US TO INCREASE OUR RIDERSHIP

03:04:15.677 --> 03:04:18.013
IT'S THE BASE OF THE GROWTH OF

03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:22.151
OUR SYSTEM WE EXPECT THAT BY

03:04:22.217 --> 03:04:22.985
TWENTY FORTY WE MAY.

03:04:23.051 --> 03:04:24.787
IN A POSITION TO CAPTURE ALMOST

03:04:24.853 --> 03:04:26.588
TRIPLE THE RIDERSHIP -- WILL

03:04:26.655 --> 03:04:28.023
HAVE TO INVEST MORE IN THE

03:04:28.090 --> 03:04:30.359
SYSTEM -- ELECTRIFICATION START

03:04:30.426 --> 03:04:32.227
BUT WITHOUT ELECTRIFICATION WE

03:04:32.294 --> 03:04:34.963
NEVER GET THEIR SO I'M I'M HERE

03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:36.098
TO SAY WITHOUT GIVING A WHOLE

03:04:36.165 --> 03:04:37.332
BUNCH OF DETAILS BECAUSE WE'VE

03:04:37.399 --> 03:04:38.667
REPORTED OUT TO THE COMMITTEE

03:04:38.734 --> 03:04:40.169
PREVIOUSLY AND AND WE CAN

03:04:40.235 --> 03:04:41.870
PROVIDE AS MANY DETAILS AS YOU'D

03:04:41.937 --> 03:04:42.438
LIKE.

03:04:42.504 --> 03:04:46.175
BUT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AGAIN --

03:04:46.241 --> 03:04:48.010
OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH HIGH SPEED

03:04:48.076 --> 03:04:49.978
RAIL AS A HOME RUN FOR HIGH

03:04:50.045 --> 03:04:51.680
SPEED RAIL ACCUSES GIVES IT

03:04:51.747 --> 03:04:54.383
ACCESS. TO OUR RIGHT AWAY WHICH

03:04:54.450 --> 03:04:56.985
IS YOU KNOW FIFTY MILES IN

03:04:57.052 --> 03:04:58.654
LENGTH.

03:04:58.720 --> 03:05:01.023
A HUNDRED MILES IN TRACKS IF YOU

03:05:01.089 --> 03:05:03.292
GO BACK AND FORTH -- WHICH IS A

03:05:03.358 --> 03:05:06.428
VERY SIGNIFICANT -- OF OF OF

03:05:06.495 --> 03:05:08.297
VALUE I BELIEVE WAS A HOME RUN

03:05:08.363 --> 03:05:09.832
FOR CALTRAIN AS WELL.

03:05:09.898 --> 03:05:12.201
IN WHEN THE STARS ALIGN IN ONE

03:05:12.267 --> 03:05:13.702
HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ABLE TO

03:05:13.769 --> 03:05:15.604
OPERATE FROM A GILROY TO SAN

03:05:15.671 --> 03:05:17.272
FRANCISCO AND FROM THE VALLEY TO

03:05:17.339 --> 03:05:18.340
THE VALLEY.

03:05:18.407 --> 03:05:19.608
WE'RE GONNA BE THERE WE'RE GONNA

03:05:19.675 --> 03:05:21.677
BE READY WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING

03:05:21.743 --> 03:05:24.480
TOGETHER IN A BLENDED SYSTEM AND

03:05:24.546 --> 03:05:26.048
I I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT TIME SO

03:05:26.114 --> 03:05:28.050
I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR YOUR TIME

03:05:28.116 --> 03:05:30.118

PROVIDING FURTHER DETAILS.

03:05:35.457 --> 03:05:36.191
THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW AT THIS

03:05:36.258 --> 03:05:37.860
POINT WILL ENTERTAIN ANY

03:05:37.926 --> 03:05:41.063
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS --

03:05:41.129 --> 03:05:42.064
SOME OF WOMAN FRIEDMAN.

03:05:42.130 --> 03:05:43.332
THANKS I'M NOT REALLY SURE THIS

03:05:43.398 --> 03:05:45.501
IS A QUESTION BUT I JUST WANTED --

03:05:45.567 --> 03:05:46.301
TO MAKE A LITTLE STATEMENT FOR

03:05:46.368 --> 03:05:47.803
SOMEONE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR

03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:49.705
BEING HERE AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE

03:05:49.771 --> 03:05:50.639
MISTER WASHINGTON HERE DOES A

03:05:50.706 --> 03:05:53.175
GREAT JOB -- WITH THIS HOME AND

03:05:53.242 --> 03:05:54.376
LA METRO SO THANKS FOR BEING

03:05:54.443 --> 03:05:57.045
HERE -- I KNOW THAT SOME OF MY

03:05:57.112 --> 03:05:58.780
COLLEAGUES EARLIER AND ONE OF

03:05:58.847 --> 03:06:00.249
THE EARLIER PANELS TALKED ABOUT

03:06:00.315 --> 03:06:02.017
THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUTHERN

03:06:02.084 --> 03:06:03.785
CALIFORNIA OF THE BURBANK TO

03:06:03.852 --> 03:06:05.487
ANAHEIM ROUTE.

03:06:05.554 --> 03:06:07.422
AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION --

03:06:07.489 --> 03:06:09.658
SOMETHING TO WHOEVER AND I'M NOT

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:11.026
EVEN SURE WHO I'M SAYING THIS TO

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:12.094
BUT JUST TO GET ON THE RECORD

03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:14.296
THAT BURBANK AIRPORT IS ABOUT TO

03:06:14.363 --> 03:06:15.731
UNDERGO.

03:06:15.797 --> 03:06:17.432
THE START THE CONSTRUCTION OF A

03:06:17.499 --> 03:06:19.434
NEW TERMINAL -- WHICH IS A MAJOR

03:06:19.501 --> 03:06:21.336
PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE

03:06:21.403 --> 03:06:21.937
AREA.

03:06:22.004 --> 03:06:24.606
AND A GIVEN THAT THE PLAN IF THE

03:06:24.673 --> 03:06:25.908
HIGH SPEED RAIL COMES THROUGH IS

03:06:25.974 --> 03:06:28.176
THAT THE STATION FOR LOS ANGELES

03:06:28.243 --> 03:06:29.645
WILL BE AT THE BURBANK AIRPORT.

03:06:29.711 --> 03:06:30.979
I JUST THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A

03:06:31.046 --> 03:06:33.415
SHAME FOR THE PLANNING AND

03:06:33.482 --> 03:06:35.183
CONSTRUCTION OF THE AIRPORT TO

03:06:35.250 --> 03:06:36.852
NOT INCLUDE.

03:06:36.919 --> 03:06:40.222
THAT EVENTUAL HIGH SPEED RAIL OR

03:06:40.289 --> 03:06:42.791
IMPROVED RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE --

03:06:42.858 --> 03:06:44.326
BECAUSE IF YOU BUILD A TERMINAL

03:06:44.393 --> 03:06:45.661
IT DOESN'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY

03:06:45.727 --> 03:06:48.130
THAT DOESN'T WORK IN CONCERT

03:06:48.196 --> 03:06:50.065
WITH WHAT COULD BE A MAJOR TRAIN

03:06:50.132 --> 03:06:51.133
TERMINAL YOU LOSE THE

03:06:51.199 --> 03:06:52.267
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A WELL

03:06:52.334 --> 03:06:53.635
THOUGHT OUT TRANSIT HUB FOR

03:06:53.702 --> 03:06:55.304
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:59.508
SO THAT PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:06:59.575 --> 03:07:00.075
VERY CRUCIAL PART OF RAIL

03:07:00.142 --> 03:07:00.709
TRANSPORTATION ALONG WITH UNION

03:07:00.776 --> 03:07:01.743
STATION OF COURSE BUT

03:07:01.810 --> 03:07:02.544
COORDINATING LIKE THAT WITH AN

03:07:02.611 --> 03:07:05.047
AIRPORT -- BECOMES THIS IS HAS

03:07:05.113 --> 03:07:07.249
SORT OF HAS A MULTIPLIER EFFECT.

03:07:07.316 --> 03:07:10.185
OF CONNECTIVE ITTY AND TRANSIT

03:07:10.252 --> 03:07:12.287
SO I DO HOPE THAT THAT'S STILL

03:07:12.354 --> 03:07:13.555
PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AND

03:07:13.622 --> 03:07:14.823
THAT WE CAN SORT OF FIGURE THIS

03:07:14.890 --> 03:07:16.491
OUT BEFORE IT BURBANK GETS TOO

03:07:16.558 --> 03:07:17.593
FAR DOWN THE ROAD WITH THEIR

03:07:17.659 --> 03:07:18.760
PLANNING PROCESS.

03:07:18.827 --> 03:07:20.295
AND THEY ARE DOING THEIR DESIGN

03:07:20.362 --> 03:07:22.197
CHARETTE RIGHT NOW THERE ARE

03:07:22.264 --> 03:07:23.065
EVER TO THEY'VE ALREADY DONE

03:07:23.131 --> 03:07:24.499
SEVERAL IN BURBANK THEY'RE

03:07:24.566 --> 03:07:27.069
MOVING NOW.

03:07:27.135 --> 03:07:28.070
TO A GLENDALE IN PASADENA.

03:07:28.136 --> 03:07:29.638
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE

03:07:29.705 --> 03:07:31.406
AIRPORT AND RIGHT NOW IT IS FAR

03:07:31.473 --> 03:07:32.741
AS I KNOW THEY'RE PROCEEDING

03:07:32.808 --> 03:07:33.642
WITH THE DESIGN OF AN AIRPORT

03:07:33.709 --> 03:07:34.576
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE A HIGH

03:07:34.643 --> 03:07:36.445
SPEED RAIL STATION AS PART OF IT

03:07:36.511 --> 03:07:38.146
AND AND THAT WOULD REALLY BE.

03:07:38.213 --> 03:07:39.681
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY THAT DOWN

03:07:39.748 --> 03:07:40.248
THE ROAD WE'RE GOING TO WORK

03:07:40.315 --> 03:07:40.916
RIGHT.

03:07:40.983 --> 03:07:42.784
AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE

03:07:42.851 --> 03:07:44.820
TO TRY TO RETROFIT THAT TERMINAL.

03:07:44.886 --> 03:07:46.221
TO HAVE.

03:07:46.288 --> 03:07:47.189
YOU KNOW TO BE THE KIND OF

03:07:47.255 --> 03:07:48.824
TROUBLE YOU SEE IN YOUR REPORTS

03:07:48.890 --> 03:07:50.192
BOTH AIRPORT AND BROWN.

03:07:50.258 --> 03:07:51.660
SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAS A

03:07:51.727 --> 03:07:54.262
RESPONSE MAYBE MISTER WASHINGTON --

03:07:54.329 --> 03:07:55.897
BUT THAT'S MY CONCERN AND AS I

03:07:55.964 --> 03:07:58.166
REPRESENT THE AIRPORT --

03:07:58.233 --> 03:07:59.801
SOMETHING THAT I YOU KNOW HAD

HAVE -- QUITE A BIT OF

03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:30.926
EXPERIENCE IN LARGE PROJECTS

03:09:30.992 --> 03:09:32.828
WHERE YOU HAVE FUNDING THAT --

03:09:32.894 --> 03:09:35.497

KEEP WORKING AT AND I THINK THAT --

03:09:40.168 --> 03:09:41.603
OUR DEALINGS WITH THE HIGH SPEED

03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:44.439
RAIL -- ON THIS IN TERMS OF

03:09:44.506 --> 03:09:46.475
STICKING -- TO SOME OF THE

FUNDING THINGS AND AND

03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:49.411
UNDERSTANDING THE RISK

03:09:49.478 --> 03:09:52.748
ASSOCIATED -- WITH -- OF FUNDING

03:09:52.814 --> 03:09:55.751
ASSUMPTIONS -- HAPPENS ON THESE

03:09:55.817 --> 03:09:57.586
BIG PROJECTS ALL THE TIME SO I

03:09:57.652 --> 03:10:00.856
THINK THAT -- GOING BACK IN

03:10:00.922 --> 03:10:02.090
APPEALING TO THE FEDERAL

03:10:02.157 --> 03:10:04.059
GOVERNMENT ON THESE FUNDS MAKES

A LOT OF SENSE TO ME -- AND I

03:10:06.828 --> 03:10:08.997
THINK -- JUST PERSONALLY

03:10:09.064 --> 03:10:10.932
SPEAKING I THINK EVENTUALLY --

03:10:10.999 --> 03:10:16.371
THOSE FUNDS WILL BE -- RECOUPED

03:10:16.438 --> 03:10:18.073
IF YOU WILL IN TIME.

03:10:18.140 --> 03:10:21.943
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:10:22.010 --> 03:10:26.314
THANK YOU AND COME BACK -- I

03:10:26.381 --> 03:10:28.283
APOLOGIZE FOR MY ABSENCE --

03:10:28.350 --> 03:10:30.218
STACY WHAT KIND OF A WHAT TYPE

03:10:30.285 --> 03:10:31.753
OF DISCUSSIONS HAVE YOU HAD WITH

03:10:31.820 --> 03:10:33.155
THE AUTHORITY ABOUT OPERATING.

03:10:33.221 --> 03:10:35.857
IN TERMS OF HIGH SPEED SERVICE

03:10:35.924 --> 03:10:36.424
AND ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT

03:10:36.491 --> 03:10:38.126
LITIGATION REGARDING.

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:40.061
PROPOSITION ONE DAY.

03:10:40.128 --> 03:10:41.596
I THINK THAT NOTION IS BEEN

03:10:41.663 --> 03:10:44.566
LOOSELY DISCUSSED I HOLD THE

03:10:44.633 --> 03:10:46.468
NOTION THAT.

03:10:46.535 --> 03:10:48.069
HIGH SPEED RAIL SHOULD BE GIVEN

03:10:48.136 --> 03:10:49.204
TO HIGH SPEED RAIL SHOULD BE

03:10:49.271 --> 03:10:50.639
DEMONSTRATED ON THE INITIAL

03:10:50.705 --> 03:10:52.073
SEGMENT TEST THE HIGH SPEED

03:10:52.140 --> 03:10:52.941
TRAINS.

03:10:53.008 --> 03:10:55.177
ELECTRIFY IT REALLY LOOK AT

03:10:55.243 --> 03:10:56.344
WHETHER IT'S VIABLE TO KEEP

03:10:56.411 --> 03:11:00.182
MOVING -- SO I HAVEN'T REALLY

03:11:00.248 --> 03:11:02.851
ENGAGED MUCH IN WHETHER OR NOT.

03:11:02.918 --> 03:11:04.286
THE SAN JOAQUIN'S OUR ACE WHAT

03:11:04.352 --> 03:11:05.921
OPERATE THAT I THINK WE CAN PLAY

03:11:05.987 --> 03:11:08.156
A PART IN THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION.

03:11:08.223 --> 03:11:09.958
BUT I DO THINK THERE IS A CHANCE

03:11:10.025 --> 03:11:11.827
TO DEMONSTRATE AND I THINK UNDER

03:11:11.893 --> 03:11:14.196
CERTAIN SCENARIOS IT COULD PAY

03:11:14.262 --> 03:11:16.064
FOR ITSELF NOT FULL SERVICE BUT

03:11:16.131 --> 03:11:17.899
MAYBE SPECIALIZED SERVICE MORE

03:11:17.966 --> 03:11:19.401
EXPRESSED DIAL SERVICE.

03:11:19.467 --> 03:11:21.069
AND THEN THE OTHER CONVENTIONAL

03:11:21.136 --> 03:11:23.672
SERVICES FILL IN THE GAPS.

03:11:23.738 --> 03:11:25.240
THAT THAT ARE SUBSIDIZED TODAY

03:11:25.307 --> 03:11:27.542
SO I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO

03:11:27.609 --> 03:11:28.610
PREDICT.

03:11:28.677 --> 03:11:30.345
THAT ANOTHER OPERATOR IS NEEDED

03:11:30.412 --> 03:11:32.814
ON THAT SEGMENT BUT IT'S

03:11:32.881 --> 03:11:34.082
CERTAINLY AN OPTION DOWN THE

03:11:34.149 --> 03:11:34.282
ROAD.

03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:35.884
THANK YOU JUST ONE MORE QUESTION

03:11:35.951 --> 03:11:37.686
FOR YOU -- DO YOU HAVE ALL THE

03:11:37.752 --> 03:11:41.289
FUNDING AND EQUIPMENT YOU NEED

TO GET TO MERCED CONNECT WITH

03:11:41.957 --> 03:11:43.525
HIGH SPEED RAIL.

03:11:43.592 --> 03:11:44.826
NO -- OUR INITIAL FUNDING THAT

03:11:44.893 --> 03:11:45.827
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON TO MERCED

03:11:45.894 --> 03:11:49.130
CAME AS PART OF THE SP ONE SP

03:11:49.197 --> 03:11:49.798
ONE THIRTY TWO PACKAGE.

03:11:49.865 --> 03:11:51.666
IN IT WE WERE SHORT FOR FULL

03:11:51.733 --> 03:11:53.735
EXTENSION TO MERCED WE CAN MAKE

03:11:53.802 --> 03:11:54.769
IT TO SERIES.

03:11:54.836 --> 03:11:56.705
BUT NOT TO MERCED SO PART OF

03:11:56.771 --> 03:11:59.407
THAT PACKAGE WAS SOME EFFORT BY

03:11:59.474 --> 03:12:01.276

STATE. TO HELP LEVERAGE ONE

03:12:03.678 --> 03:12:05.046
TRAIN DOWN TO MERCEDAND I THINK

03:12:05.113 --> 03:12:06.848
WITH THE REAL ROAD WE ARE CLOSE

03:12:06.915 --> 03:12:08.283
TO DOING THAT WITH THE EXISTING

03:12:08.350 --> 03:12:09.818
FUNDING PACKAGE.

03:12:09.885 --> 03:12:11.286
BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE FULL

03:12:11.353 --> 03:12:13.021
FUNDING PACKAGE TO MEET UP WITH

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:15.290

THE WHOLE SPIGOT THAT HIGH SPEED

03:12:21.363 --> 03:12:23.131
RAIL IS PLANNING INITIALLY --

03:12:23.198 --> 03:12:24.366
BUT WE ARE WE ARE LACKING

03:12:24.432 --> 03:12:26.968
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO

03:12:27.035 --> 03:12:28.069
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION.

03:12:28.136 --> 03:12:29.571
TO DOUBLE TRACK THE MERCED

03:12:29.638 --> 03:12:31.740
PORTION U. P. MIGHT WORK WITH US

03:12:31.806 --> 03:12:33.041

03:12:44.152 --> 03:12:45.654
GO WITHOUT DOUBLE TRACKING THE

03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:47.155
WHOLE WAY BUT I I WOULD SAY

03:12:49.557 --> 03:12:53.561
BILLION DOLLARS TO LONG STRETCH

03:12:53.628 --> 03:12:54.062

03:12:55.931 --> 03:12:58.400
BUDGET.

03:12:58.466 --> 03:12:59.868
THIS NEW PLANET OF THE NEW PLAN

03:12:59.935 --> 03:13:01.169
HINGES ON A CLOSE PARTNERSHIP

03:13:01.236 --> 03:13:02.003
BETWEEN THE AUTHORITY.

03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:03.638

03:13:10.779 --> 03:13:13.048
FUNDING PARTNERS -- WE HAVE

03:13:13.114 --> 03:13:15.016
SEVERAL FUNDING PARTNERS.

03:13:15.083 --> 03:13:18.687
AND WITHOUT THE HIGH SPEED ROLES

03:13:18.753 --> 03:13:20.422
OF FUNDING PARTNER WE WOULD NOT.

03:13:20.488 --> 03:13:21.423
BE ABLE TO DO OUR
