UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.129
FAMILIES IT WAS REALLY HARD HIT.

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.264
BY THE RECESSION AND BECAUSE OF

00:24:26.331 --> 00:24:27.899
THAT THEY HAD TO SPEND DOWN ALL

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:31.536
OF THEIR RETIREMENT SECURITY TO

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:32.103
TRY THAT.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.371
YEAH KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:35.006

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:36.208
RECESSION LASTED TOO LONG THEY

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.709
WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT SO NOT

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:38.777
ONLY DID I LOSE A BUSINESS THEY

00:24:38.844 --> 00:24:40.779
ALSO HOME SO -- THERE'S NO

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:41.880
RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR THEM SO

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.248
THAT FALLS ON MYSELF AND OUR

00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:46.117
OTHER IT AND MY SIBLINGS -- TO

TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.322
BECAUSE THAT THEY ARE.

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:51.489
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT LONG TERM

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.792
CARE INSURANCE -- NOR THE

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:55.393
FINANCIAL STABILITY THAT THEY

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.596
ONCE HAD FOR WHEN THEY RETIRE SO --

00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:58.263
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.865
RIGHT -- THERE ARE LESS

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:01.299
PROVIDERS NOW THAN THERE USED TO

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:02.267

TERM CARE INSURANCE WHICH ALSO --

00:25:08.607 --> 00:25:09.674
DRIVES UP THE COST BECAUSE

THERE'S NOT AS MANY PROVIDER SO --

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:15.180
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A BETTER

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:41.398
ACTUALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO REMAIN

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.400

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:23.907
MONEY.

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.375

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.476
EITHER COMES FROM THE STATE

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.711

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.544
TEN ELDERS IN THE STATE.

01:11:55.611 --> 01:11:57.713
HAS SUFFERED ELDER ABUSE IT OUT

01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:59.214
I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT.

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:01.283
ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FOURTEEN CASES

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:02.885
OF ELDER ABUSE EVEN GETS

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:05.054
REPORTED SO -- CALIFORNIA NOW

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.990
HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF ELDER

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:08.524
ABUSE OF ANY STATE IN THE

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.058
COUNTRY.

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.659
WHICH I FIND ASTONISHING AND

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:11.460
IT'S JUST GOING TO GET WORSE

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.195
BECAUSE OUR ELDER POPULATION IS

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:14.930
GOING TO MORE THAN DOUBLE BY THE

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.632
YEAR -- TWENTY TWENTY SIX THIS

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:18.734
BILL AB THIRTEEN NINETY SIX IS A

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.602
STE IN A SMALL WAY SEEKS TO DEAL

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:21.770
WITH THAT PROBLEM IT.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:25.741
ALLOWS A JUDGE TO IMPOSE.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:28.110
A CLINICAL COUNSELING OR ANGER

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.446
MANAGEMENT CLASSES ON A BATTERER

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.548
WHEN ISSUING AID -- ELDER ABUSE

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.216
RESTRAINING ORDER JUDGES ALREADY

01:12:34.283 --> 01:12:35.384
HAVE THAT DISCRETION WHEN

01:12:35.451 --> 01:12:36.985
ISSUING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.020
RESTRAINING ORDER I THINK IT

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:40.022
MAKES GREAT SENSE TO ALLOW THEM

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:40.923
THAT DISCRETION.

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:43.325
WHEN -- ISSUING A ELDER ABUSE

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.094

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.695

ELDER ABUSE THAN ANY STATE IN

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:55.137
THE COUNTRY I THINK WOULD BE A

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:58.006
GOOD THING.

01:12:58.073 --> 01:12:59.875
