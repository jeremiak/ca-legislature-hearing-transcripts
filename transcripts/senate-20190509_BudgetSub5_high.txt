NUMBER. FIVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE JUDICIARY BUT WE ARE STARTING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE RATHER NEW COMMITTEE THE WHOLE BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YET. BUT I'M WE HAVE. MEMBERS PRESENTING AT OTHER BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO SORE GONNA HAVE A LOT OF IN AND OUT TODAY. BECAUSE EVERYONE IS ASSEMBLED AND WE DON'T WANT TO DELAY WE WILL START OUR HEARING. SO WE ARE BEGINNING. ON PART A WHICH IS -- THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WE HAVE A VOTE ONLY ITEM. WHICH WE WILL -- WE HAVE A COUPLE OF VOTE ONLY ITEMS WHICH I'M GONNA HOLD AND NOT DO YET OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THE OTHER MEMBERS ARE NOT HERE. AND SO I WILL START WITH A DISCUSSION ITEM WHICH IS ISSUE FOR AND THAT IS THE BROADBAND COMMUNICATION. A NINE ELEVEN IN NINE ONE ONE IMMIGRATION AND SUCH SO IF -- WE COULD HAVE MR MID. BIGGER **** AND MR CAREER BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT TOO WILL BE PRESENTING [inaudible] THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOT MY AS YOU AGE SAID NINE MY NAME'S MITCH MEDI GIVE IT SHOULD GET THE DIRECTOR CALLOW YES CELL AND I OVERSEE OUR LOGISTICS. ORGANIZATION WITH ME TODAY IS MY COLLEAGUE A BUNCH CAREER. WAS A BRANCH MANAGER FOR A NINE ONE ONE OFFICE -- IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT -- THREE CRITICAL ISSUES FACING US WITHIN. AND I WON AREA. FOR IT -- THOSE THREE COMPONENTS INCLUDE BROADBAND. AND THEN SOME BRIDGE FUNDING THAT WERE LOOK FOR TO MAKE US A HOLE FOR THE UPCOMING US SESSION AND THEN -- OUR TRAILER BILL -- SOLAR EACH OF THOSE -- THREE INTER TWINED TOGETHER BECAUSE ARE ALL SET IN A FUNDED. FROM THIS OF THE BROADBAND. INITIATIVE FOR US IS SUCH. A REQUEST FOR A LITTLE OVER MILLION DOLLARS AND AUTHORITY FOR SIX POSITIONS. THAT WE CAN HIRE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO INTERFACE. WITH -- OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS -- SPECIFICALLY FOR INTER OPERABILITY AND HOW WE'RE GOING -- TO OVERSEE AND CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER -- OUR INTEGRATION WITH FIRST AT AND HOW ORGAN TÁI FIRST IT TOGETHER WITHIN THE NINE ONE COMMUNITY SO. THAT INNER OPERABILITY ISSUE FOR US AND IT'S AN OVERSIGHT ISSUE FORCE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS KIND ENOUGH -- TO FUND US FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS THROUGH A GRANT. THAT GRANT HAS EXPIRED AND THERE'S NO FURTHER FUNDING -- FOR THEM TO SUPPORT US WITH ANY PERSONNEL THAT WERE. I'M USING TO ADMINISTER AND SUPPORT THAT FOR US. THE BRIDGE FUNDING. AS A AS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE -- INFUSION TO ENSURE. THAT WE CAN NOW CONTINUE TO SUPPORT NINE ONE ACTIVITIES. THROUGH THIS -- COMING FISCAL YEAR. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT US. AND IN THE TRAILER BILL OF COURSE IS THE COMPLETE RESTRUCTURING THE TRAILER BILL. AND HAS -- WILL ACTUALLY BRING US INTO. FULL -- MODERNIZATION EFFORTS FOR THE TAX REVENUE CODE I'M SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF DECLINING REVENUE. FOR OUR NINE ONE ONE PROGRAM IN ACTION BEFORE WITH THE INITIATIVES. THAT IN PLACE FOR FOR US. THE TRAILER RULES CRITICAL TO US BECAUSE OUR REVENUE CONTINUES DECLINE IT'S A MATTER OF FACT. AND IT'S OUR CONDITION FUND STATEMENTS ARE VERY CLEAR ON THIS LAST YEAR WE TOOK IN A BOB ACTUALLY SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TEXAS. APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ANNUALLY TO RUN THE LEGACY HARKEN TO EXISTING NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM -- SO. THIS FUNDING WILL ALLOW AT LEAST ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT TO ENDEAVOR. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATOR LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES HAS ASKED US TO MODERNIZE AND DIRECTED US TO MODERNIZE. OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. WE'RE PREPARED TO DO SO BUT WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR SOURCE TO DO THAT SO -- THE THAT EFFORT ALL HINGES ON THE TRAILER BILL PASSED ALLOWING US TO RESTRUCTURE -- THAT PROCESS. FROM OUR STANDPOINT THE TRIGGER BILLS -- FAIR IT'S EQUITABLE -- THE RATES WILL BE AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE NATION -- WHEN WE SET THEM? AND THE BENEFITS ARE EXCEPTIONAL FORCE FOR NEXT GENERATION. NINE ONE ONE DOMINIC TO TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE A BUNCH CAREER AND YOU CAN GO IN TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE FEWER EXAMPLES ON SOME OF THE BENEFITS FROM THE X. GENERATION I'M ON ONE MODERNIZATION. I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT AND ESTABLISH REFORM WE HAVE ROLL CALL. I UNDERSTAND. NEVER MORE LONG [inaudible] SENATE ABOUT. RIGHT WERE NO. A REAL COMMITTEE SO. YOU MAY CONTINUE WE'RE ON THE ITEM ON THE NINE ONE ONE INTEGRATION IN THE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION [inaudible] GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS BUDGETARY ON THE NINE ONE BRENT BRANCH MANAGER AND OVERSEE THE NINE ONE PROGRAM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AS AS MITCH SAID -- OURS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS -- IS BEFORE YOU IT'S PART OF THIS BUDGET PROCESS. WANTED TO GIVE YOU JUST A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES AND AND THIS TRAILER BILL VERSES THE THE BILL THAT. COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE AS IT MOVES FORWARD. SO ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THAT TRAILER BILL IS -- LAST YEAR THERE WAS A RANGE FROM TWENTY TO EIGHTY CENTS THIS YEAR WE'VE REMOVE THAT BOTTOM END SO ESSENTIALLY IT'S ZERO TO EIGHTY SENSES THE RANGE -- THAT THAT BILL CAN BE SET. THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN THE FLOOR DEBATE LAST YEAR AND AS WITH THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE TRAILER BILL AND HOW EXACTLY THAT RATE WOULD BE SAT. SO WE WANTED TO KIND OF BRING THAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU WERE AWARE OF OUR ROLE IN THAT PROCESS SO EACH YEAR WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO FIND NINE ONE ONE FOR THE STATE. AS WELL AS UPGRADE BASED ON LEGISLATIVE FIVE DIRECTION TO NEXT GEN I'M ON ONE WE COME UP WITH OUR PROPOSED BUDGET. REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND APPROVED AND GOES TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROCESS. AT THAT POINT ONCE THE THE BILL IS IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PASSED THE SETS ARE PRO RATIONS NUMBER. THAT NUMBER COMES BACK TO ME AND THAT'S THE BASELINE IN THIS LEGISLATION BY WHICH WE SET THE FEE. FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO WE CANNOT COLLECT MORE THAN THAT APPROPRIATED AMOUNTS TO TAKE THAT APPROPRIATE AMOUNT. COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES THAT ARE REPORTED BY ALL THE CARRIERS. AND THEN IT'S JUST SIMPLE MATH TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH THE FEE NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED ON A MONTHLY BASIS. IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE REVENUE TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. AND THAT FEE IS PASSED BACK OVER TO CD TFA. WHO ESTABLISHES THE FEE FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THIS PROCESS A AND A AND ALONG THE WAY? IN OUR NEXT YEAR WILL BE BACK AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT LEVEL IS IS SET APPROPRIATELY. THE OTHER CHANGE IN THE LEGISLATION FROM LAST YEAR. WAS. WE WE DEFINE. THE ALL THE NINE ONE FEES ALL FEES ARE SO SHE WOULD NINE ONE INSIDE THIS REVENUE TAX CODE. FOR NINE ONE THE LINKAGES TO OTHER PIECES OF REVENUE AND TAX CODE -- SECTIONS JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAN IF IT'S NINE ONE IT'S IN THE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE SURCHARGE USERS ACT OR THE STE WHICH GOES INTO THE STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT OR SET NOT. AND THEN FINALLY -- WE AN INCREASE THE AND WE WE DEFINE NEXT AND I'M A ONE IN SUCH A WAY. THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. FOR ALERT MORNINGS SO YOU'LL SEE THAT DEFINITIONS EXPANDED ON THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A STATEWIDE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT'S CAPABLEOF DELIVERING A LEARNED WARNINGS IS. OBVIOUSLY VERY RELEVANT IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO THIS DEFINITION MAKE SURE THAT NEXT GEN I'M ONE CAN SUPPORT THAT. IT DOESN'T IMPACT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES -- ABILITY TO SEND AN ALERT MORNING THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROCESS IS JUST A COMMON TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. FOR THAT. AND THE OTHER THING WE WANTED TO MENTION IS -- THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THIS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET US THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR AND INTO NEXT YEAR. BUT ONE TO MENTION THAT. WHILE THESE ONE TIME FUNDING -- INCREASES ARE HELPFUL TO GET US THROUGH THESE INTERIM STEPS WILL REALLY NEED IS A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE FUNDING MODEL. WE MANAGE MULTIPLE CONTRACTS THAT GO OVER MULTIPLE YEARS -- SOME TEN YEARS AND L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G.&lt;/c&gt; SO HAVING A YEAR TO YEAR FUNDING MECHANISM TO SUPPORT A TEN YEAR CONTRACT. IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE PROGRAM WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT AND AND YOU'RE NOT SURE THE FINDINGS THERE SO. HISTORICALLY THE SET IN A FUND HAS BEEN A A FEE. AND IT HAS SUPPORTED NINE ONE ONE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND HAS PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE FUNDING MODELS THAT WE HAVE. AND SO THAT'S WHERE THIS -- NEW FUNDING MODEL FOCUSES ON ESTABLISHING A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE MODEL. WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR US. I'M BEFORE SEE IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION -- AS WE SPEAK THE GOVERNOR IS PRESENTING HIS MAY REVISION [inaudible] I'M. WILL THERE BE A ARE YOU -- DO YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION OF WHETHER WE WILL BE RECEIVING A CHANGE IN THIS. ITEM WITH THE MAY REVISION. I'M SURE STEVEN BANDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO THERE'S NO UPDATE TO THIS PROPOSAL THE MAYOR VISION. WE HAD THE ITEM KEY DOES HOLD OPEN AND IN THE NOT ASSUMING THAT THERE WOULD BE BUT THAT IT WAS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY. I'M. MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A THERE ARE. IS IN OUR STAFF REPORT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES REQUEST I'M GOING ONE MILLION DOLLARS. STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT AND SIX POSITIONS TO SUPPORT. THE IMPLEMENTATION ONGOING WORKLOAD WHAT'S THE COST OF THE SIX POSITIONS. THAT NUMBER IN FRONT OF YOU. I COULD GO ON LOOKING MORE DETAIL -- JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD MY RECOLLECTION IS THE MILLION DOLLARS IS THE COST OF THE SIX POSITIONS BUT I I COULD DOUBLE CHECK THAT FOR YOU SORRY A RECENT TO THE ASSIGNMENT AND SO -- WHAT'S FRESH OFF TOP MY MIND MAY NOT BE PERFECT AND THEN. WE CASTING THE FEE FROM A PERCENTAGE RATE SURCHARGE TO A FLAT RATE FEE. WHAT'S THE AVERAGE FLAT RATE FEE BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE THAT WAS AT SIXTY CENTS IS A NINETY CENT. YEAH SO THAT THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION SO. RIGHT NOW THE FEE AS SET BASED ON INTRASTATE VOICE REVENUE -- AND SO THAT VARIES FROM. THE CALCULATION OF THE REVENUE BROUGHT IN WHETHER IT'S WIRELINE WIRELESS VOICE OVER IP. OR MOBILE PREPAID AND SO EACH OF THOSE REVENUE STREAMS HAVE A DIFFERENT PORTION ALLOCATED TO VOICE. AND DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE FROM THE NUMBERS THE EXACT RATES BUT WHAT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT WIRELINE PAYS A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT. IF YOU HAVE A HARD LINE WIRELINE PHONE INTO YOUR HOME. THAT'S MAJORITY VOICE IS WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR AND SO YOU'RE PAYING A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT. COMPARED TO WIRELESS WHERE THE BULK OF THE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH A WIRELESS BILL IS REALLY FOR DATA. IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR WIRELESS BUILD REGARDLESS OF CARRIER. VOICES ALMOST FREE AND IT'S A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE OVERALL BILL THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S CAUSING THE DECLINE IN REVENUE. THE BULK OF OUR USERS ARE PAYING THE SMALLEST. PERCENTAGE OF OF THE OVERALL FEES SO 80% ROUGHLY OF OUR NINE ONE CALLS COME FROM WIRELESS DEVICES. YET THE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE WIRELESS USERS IS THE LOWEST OF THE THREE CATS. THE FOUR CATEGORIES CENTER IN THERE AND WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES THE IS IT JUST ESTABLISH THE MALL THE SAME SETS THE SAME EXACT RATE. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE WIRELINE USER OF VOICE OVER IP USER WIRELESS USER OUR MOBILE PREPAID. THIS IS ALSO THE SAME SAME MODEL THAT'S USED IN EVERY OTHER STATE. WE'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS OF ALL THE OTHER STATES ARE DOING THIS AND IT'S THE SAME. TWO NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS TO THAT BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY'S IN THE SAME FLAT FEE MODEL. IS THAT ENSURE QUESTION NO. I'M SO THE TRIAL DIFFERENTLY THAN. IF YOU HAVE A VOICE [inaudible] YOU'RE PAYING [inaudible] A NICKEL. SO NOTHING YET SO THE NUMBERS THAT I HAVE ARE ONLY ESTIMATES SO IF IF YOU'RE HAPPY WITH SOME SOME ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE ESTIMATES WE CAN GIVE YOU THOSE SO. WIRELINE NUMBERS ARE ROUGHLY. TWENTY SEVEN CENTS WE THINK BASED ON THE NUMBERS WE HAVE ACCESS -- TO VOICE OVER IP IS PROBABLY LESS THAN FIVE CENTS AND WIRELESS IS A LITTLE BIT OVER FIVE CENTS AND AGAIN. WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA TO GIVE YOU A DEFINITIVE NUMBER BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A DISPROPORTIONATE. LEVEL IN AND HOW IT'S DISTRIBUTED TODAY SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL AGAIN. ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE NUMBERS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES AN INCREASE OF FOUR THOUSAND FORTY TIMES RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS A REFER SOMEONE ON WIRELESS AVOID THEY'RE GONNA GET A WE'RE GONNA SEE SOMETHING IN THEIR BILL. SO THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE BUT IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE A SIX DOLLAR INCREASE PER MONTH. RIGHT NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE TALKING LESS THAN THE CUP OF THE PRICE OF A CUP OF COFFEE. FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR TO GET A SUSTAINABLE NINE ONE PROGRAM RIGHT IN -- AND IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS AS AS MITCH SAID. THE REVENUES WE BRING AND JUST SIMPLY DON'T SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. YOU KNOW IT IF IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY -- WE YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE ALL FOR IT BUT AND WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE. FOR NINE ONE ONE NINE ONE FAILS LIVES ARE AT RISK AND WE WE JUST SIMPLY CANNOT ALLOW NINE ONE FAIL. YOU'VE HAD A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM OF PEOPLE TRANSFERRED FROM HARD LINES TO WIRELESS. AND THIS BEEN GOING ON FOR WHAT THIRTY YEARS. AND SO NOW WE'RE FINALLY REACTING AND WE'RE GOING FROM A NICKEL TO EIGHTY CENTS AS OPPOSED TO A NICKEL TO DRAW A DIME. FIFTEEN TO TWENTY RAISING IN OVERTIME SO THIS IS JUST GONNA REQUIRED TWO THIRDS VOTE MANAGER. BUT THIS BE CONSIDERED A TAX INCREASE. YES THE TRAILER BILL WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS. ALRIGHT WE'RE BACK TO WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR. I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION WHILE THE TRAILER BILL ALLOWS A RANGE OF ZERO TO EIGHTY IT WILL NOT BE SET AT EIGHTY THE RANGE THAT SAT IS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT UPON THE APPROPRIATION THAT'S GIVEN TO CALLOW YES BY. NO BY BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY AS APPROVED BY THE AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE PATIENT IT'S UP TO NOT TO EXCEED BUT IT WRECKED BUT IT WOULD NOT. IN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT WOULD NOT UNLESS WE WERE TO APPROPRIATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IT WOULD NOT GO UP TO THAT FOR PER CELLULAR USER THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT -- AND WHAT IT THE SP IS IT MORE-ACCURATE OR CAN YOU. COULD YOU. FIVE GIVE US SOME SOME SENSE THAT IT WOULD BE. MORE ON THE BORDER OF THAT WHAT IS WHAT THE SO USER WOULD EXPERIENCE IF WE WERE TO APPROVE THIS WOULD BE MORE ON THE ORDER OF WHAT THE HARD LINE. USER IS NOW PAYING. SO IF I COULD HAVE. SO BASED ON THE CURRENT -- PROPOSED APPROPRIATION LEVEL THE ESTIMATE IS THAT THE FEE WOULD INITIALLY BE SET IN THE THIRTY THREE THIRTY FOUR CENTS RANGE -- AND I COULD SAY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LOOKINGAT MY OWN PERSONAL CELL PHONE BILL I PAY NINE CENTS A MONTH -- FOR NINE ONE ONE SO FOR ME IT WOULD GO FROM NINE CENTS TO THIRTY THREE CENTS -- IS THE CURRENT ESTIMATE. OF THE IMPACT AT THIS POINT. CONTINUE TO OUR NORTH I THINK THAT'S IT I'M I'M JUST. YOU KNOW WE GOT A CONTACT HERE IN A WATER TAX THERE AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A CUP OF COFFEE ANYMORE IT'S A GALLON. AND SO I JUST WANNA. BUT IF RESPECT. THANK WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE TO AND AND YOUR CONCERN AND IF WE HAD ANOTHER WAY -- TO TO DO THIS WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE MINIMAL AYE AYE I CAN TELL YOU THAT WERE. NOW WE WERE WERE NOT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. AND IT IS TO CRITICAL IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE THE START POINT FOR EVERYTHING WE DO. AND FOR EVERY EMERGENCY AND AS MUCH SAID FIVE NINE ONE FAILS LIVES -- FIVE SERVER IN JEOPARDY AND SO -- IN. WE'VE WE'VE GOT A SUPPORT. I'M NOT ARGUING THAT POINT -- THE ISSUE IS AT A BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF PRIORITIES. AND SO WE HAVE STILL TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION OF SURPLUS AS THE TERM. BEING USED. AND SO. WHY IS? A GOOD PORTION OF THAT OR A PORTION OF THAT. BUT IN TO HELP YOU THAT BEING PAYS DOWN AND THEN YOUR RATES BEING PHASED IN. OVER TIME SO YOU MEET YOUR HAPPY. YOU KNOW GOAL SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE FUTURE YOU HAVE A FUNDING SOURCE THAT'S MORE PREDICTABLE -- BUT I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED. BECAUSE EVEN THE MEDIA IS ALREADY SAYING HOW DO YOU DO A% TAX INCREASE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. SO WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND I JUST WANTED. TO BROUGHT A LITTLE BIT THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU MATTER. IF I COULD JUST CLARIFY TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION I DO HAVE CONFIRMATION THE MILLION DOLLARS IS THE ON GOING COSTS THE SIX POSITIONS [inaudible] YEAH. IN TO CERTAIN EXTENT WE ARE BOUNCING THAT ONE TIME USE THAT'S WITH A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER IS IS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TRANSFER SO THAT WE CAN. HELP WITH THAT -- STRUCTURAL DEFICIT BUT ALSO SOME OF THE ONE TIME COSTS FOR THE SWITCH. TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THE FEE IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR TRANSFER THIS YEAR. THEN THE THIRTY THREE CENTS THAT I WAS CITING EARLIER IS OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE WOULD OBVIOUSLY GO UP BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COVER -- BASICALLY PAYING BACK WHATEVER SORT OF GENERAL FUND ON WE DID. TO TO BRIDGE THE GAP. WE ARE WE ARE USING THE ONE TIME. THE SURPLUS IS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW TO HELP OUT WITH THIS PROGRAM AS WELL [inaudible] I'M. I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT WAS. NOT FULLY CLEAR FROM THE ITEM WHAT THE ACTUAL IMPACT. FOR CELLULAR USER WOULD BE. AND THE WIRELESS USER HOWEVER WE WANT TO DESCRIBE IT AND YOU KNOW I EIGHT I WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR ACTING LAST YEAR BECAUSE I DON'T RECALL RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE -- RESULTED IN A A THIRTY THREE CENTS SAID. INCREASE TO THE PER USER OR WHATEVER WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY LOWER SO THAT THEN YOU KNOW WE COULD HAVE HAD THAT MORE. GRADUATED AS PRE DATED AS YOUR DESCRIBING. BUT I I KNOW I TOTALLY APPRECIATE THE POINT THAT YES WE HAVE. WE WE HAVE MORE REVENUES NOW THEN THE BUDGET THAT'S PROPOSED. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THESE ON GOING EXPENSES. AND IT'S ONE OF THESE WHERE WE ARE WE ARE GOING TO BE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR THE NEXT FOREVER. UNTIL COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES POP IN DEPENDENT ON THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOR OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES AND WITH THE DEATHS IN THE FIRES. OF LAST YEAR. AND JUST WITH HOW MUCH I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS NINE ONE ONE SERVICE IS. I FEEL LIKE QUEEN -- IT'S HARD BUT WE NEED TO BITE THE BULLET AND I AND GET DE. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SUSTAINABLE FINDING. AND WHILE CERTAINLY WE COULD USE SOME OF OUR SURPLUS FOR THAT PURPOSE -- IT EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THIS AND THERE ARE OTHER DEBTS IN OTHERS THINGS THAT ARE REALLY ONE TIME ONLY TYPE OF USES THAT. WHILE I'M A IT OBVIOUSLY NOT THE GOVERNOR AND I WILL NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY OPINE ON WHAT MIGHT BE THE BEST. THE ONE TIME USES OF THAT EXTRA MONEY WE HAVE SINCE THIS IS AN ON GOING I'M COMFORTABLE. WITH ACTING ON IT AND THE ITEM WAS ON HELD OPEN OR IN MARCH AND DESIGNATED IS HELD OPEN. IN ANTICIPATION THAT THERE MIGHT BE AN ADJUSTMENT MADE ME REVISED BUT SINCE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS INDICATED. THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE SUCH THERE. THERE IS NOT. SUCH AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE MAY REVISE. AND BASICALLY WE WOULD JUST HAVE THIS VERY SAME ITEM BEFORE US AGAIN NEXT WEEK. I'M I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT WE VOTE ON IT [inaudible] TODAY -- ANY OTHER COMMENTS SERVER -- QUESTION [inaudible] RIGHT SO. WE I HAVE A MOTION.

THANK YOU ARE SO HEALTH CARE FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN BY THE ACRONYM A PICTURE IS -- THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FEDERAL -- HEALTH CARE RECEIVER TO IMPROVE OUTPATIENT HEALTH CARE FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE PRISON SYSTEM. SIX RANGE FROM -- PRIMARY CARE CLINICS ESPECIALLY CARE CLINICS MEDICATION DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND PHARMACIES. OVERALL IT'S ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF BOTH NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION -- IN VERY COMPLEXITY TO PRISON WITH AS MANY AS EIGHT TO TEN INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS SOME GOING SIMULTANEOUSLY OTHERS WAITING FOR THE INITIAL PROJECTS TO GET COMPLETED. OVERALL STATEWIDE ARE CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION SITS AT OF THE TWENTY FIVE PRISONS ARE FUNDED BY THE APPROPRIATION QUESTION WE HAVE COMPLETED ALL CONSTRUCTION AT FIVE OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE IN A SIX ONE WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH. CONSTRUCTION IS PROGRESSING INTO REMAINING NINETEEN SITES WITH THREE ADDITIONAL SITES -- EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN AS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED THE PROGRAM HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASED CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- ALL AVAILABLE FUNDING -- FROM THE EXISTING APPROPRIATION HAS BEEN FULLY ALLOCATED TO THESE PROJECTS INCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT. SO BASED UPON OUR PROJECTIONS AND INITIAL AN ADDITIONAL FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT FIVE MILLION IS REQUESTED IN THIS ACTION TO ADDRESS ANTICIPATED FUNDING NEEDS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE TESE PROJECTS -- WITHOUT THE FUNDING INCREASE -- APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN OF THE REMAINING PROJECTS TO BE A RISK OF HALTING CONSTRUCTION OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR -- SOME OF THE REASONS ARE FOR THE COSTS INCREASE AT THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE I'LL TRY TO BE VERY BRIEF -- WE HAVE ERRORS AND OMISSIONS FROM OUR DESIGN CONSULTANTS -- UNANTICIPATED SITE CONDITIONS ESPECIALLY IN OUR RENOVATION PROJECTS WHICH ARE PART OF THE THE SECOND HALF OF HICCUP A A LOT OF THE RENOVATION PROJECT FOR FINDING. THINGS INSIDE THE WALLS AND CEILINGS THAT NEED ADDITIONAL FIXES -- UNFORTUNATELY IN SOME OF OUR NEW BUILDING PROJECTS WE HAVE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL REVISED PRIOR INTERPRETATIONS REGARDING EXITING FOR THOSE BUILDINGS WHICH IS LED TO INCREASE CONSTRUCTION SCOPE IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THOSE BUILDINGS AND GET OCCUPANCY -- AS I STATED WERE ALSO GETTING INSPECTIONS OF AREAS IN EXISTING BUILDINGS WHERE THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE REQUIRING ADDITIONAL -- SMOKE AND AND FIRE -- PROTECTIONS IN THERE THE ADDITIONAL CAUGHT THE ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ONE DRIVER COST ANOTHER STRONG DRIVER COST IS THE INCREASED OVERHEAD REQUESTS FROM THE GENERAL CONTRACTORS AS THE PROJECTS GET DELAYED BY THESE ADDITIONAL SCOPE OF WORK THAT WAS NOT IN THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACTS. WE'VE TAKEN EFFORTS OVER THE PAST YEAR TO ADDRESS AND AND MITIGATE SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL OSTS -- WE'VE IDENTIFIED COMPONENTS OF THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE LIKELY LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS AND WILL BE PURSUING THAT WORK SEPARATELY -- FROM THE EXISTING PROJECTS THROUGH THE INMATE LABOR PROGRAM. WE WERE ALSO FOCUSED EFFORTS ON REMOVING OBSTACLES -- SPECIAL REGARDING OUR GENERAL CONTRACTORS -- THESE OBSTACLES ARE IMPEDING THEIR PROGRESS SO THAT WE CAN GET THE GENERAL CONTRACTORS WORK COMPLETED AND RELEASED HIM FROM THEIR CONTRACTS -- THE EXTENT OVERHEAD CLAIMS ARE OUR MAJOR DRIVER COSTS AND SO THE EFFORT THE FOCUS WE CAN PUT ON GETTING THE GENERAL CONTRACTORS TO THE END LINE -- WILL HELP MINIMIZE ANY COST INCREASES. SO. PRIOR TO QUESTIONS I JUST WANNA END WITH SAYING THAT HE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> PROGRAM IN THE WE'RE BACK HERE AGAIN THIS YEAR. WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE IN BETTER SHAPE TODAY THAN WE WERE A YEAR AGO -- THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE COMPLETION -- HAS INCREASED FROM WE'REGONNA NUMBER PRISONS WERE FULLY COMPLETED WITH THE WORK AND AND HOPE -- TO KEEP ADDING TO THAT OVER THE NEXT YEAR -- SO WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST APPROVAL OF THIS ITEM TO ASSIST US IN FULL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM.

HI MY NAME'S AMANDA BURGER ON THE LEADERSHIP ON LEADERSHIP TEAM OF THE TRANSFORMATIVE IMPRISONING WORKING GROUP AND ALSO -- PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITHIN TAKE GARDEN PROGRAM I WANT TO OFFER TWO PARAGRAPHS. FROM A LETTER BY LIEUTENANT DOUGLAS NAIL WHO WORKED FOR TWENTY YEARS. ON THE YARD AT AFTER ALL STATE PRISON AND HE HAS. WRITTEN A LETTER IN SUPPORT OF A SENATOR BRADFORD TO ALLOCATION. I HAVE WORKED IN STATE PRISONS FOR NEARLY TWENTY TWO YEARS. DURING THAT TIME I WITNESSED FIRST HAND. THE LONELINESS HOPELESSNESS AND OPPRESSION YEARS OF CRUSHING OVERCROWDING WROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA'S PRISONS. I HAVE WORKED AS A CORRECTIONAL OFFICER SERGEANT COUNSELOR LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN. IN EACH OF THESE ROLES I'VE INTIMATELY EXPERIENCE THE TRAGEDY. LIMITED EXPOSURE TO POSITIVE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING BRINGS TO A PRESENT. PRISONS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT PLACES TO MANAGE WE EXPERIENCE IN WITNESS THINGS IN PRISON NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE. BUT I'VE ALSO WITNESSED EXTRAORDINARY ACTS OF KINDNESS AND HUMANITY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE RESTORATION OF COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMING IN THE PRISONS. INCREASING COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN PRISON MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING AND REHABILITATION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PRISON ENDEAVOR. FURTHER WHEN COMMUNITY PROGRAMS ARE A CONSTANT DAILY PRESENCE ON PRISON YARDS. TRANSPARENCY IN OPERATIONS IN TREATMENT BECOME THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION. WHEN PEOPLE LIKE ARNALDO TREVINO ON THE COUNTLESS COMMUNITY MEMBERS STANDING WITH HIM WALK INTO A PRISON THE INSTITUTION IMMEDIATELY BECOMES A SAFER MORE EFFECTIVE PLACE? COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN PROGRAMMING SHOULD BECOME IS COMMON ON PRISON YARDS AS RAISING WHITE RAZOR WIRE AND CONCRETE ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY ARE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE. GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN THE CROWDED HOPELESS DANGEROUS PRISONS I HAVE EXPERIENCED AND THE POSITIVE ENCOURAGING HUMANIZING PLACES I'VE SEEN SOME OF THEM BECOME. I WOULD STAND WITH ARNOLD A THOUSAND TIMES AND WITH THIS ALLOCATION FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU LIEUTENANT DOUGLAS NOW. MY NAME IS EMILY HARRIS I'M WITH THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND I HAVE BEEN A VOLUNTEER IN PRISONS FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS -- I THINK THAT THESE PROGRAMS -- IN A LOT OF THE MEMBERS WE WORK WITH. ELLA BAKER CENTER ARE THE MOST TRANSFORMATIONAL THERE THE CONNECTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHILE THEY'RE BOTH INSIDE AND DO THE DEEP. TRANSFORMATIVE WORK BUT ALSO -- IN SUPPORT PEOPLE AS THEIR RETURNING HOME IN THE COMMUNITY -- AND WHEN LOOKING AT THE LARGER CDC ARE CORRECTION BUDGET THIS MONEY IS JUST A FRACTION ANYTHING THESE ARE ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE BEST PROGRAMS -- THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR PRESENCE IN THE STATE. THE OTHERS YOU CAN CLOSE MY IN REMOVAL ALONE. SORRY TO INTERRUPT. MY NAME IS MISS A PULLEY THOUGH I'M WITH THE TRANS LOOKING UP COALITION -- CHEST ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO WE HELD OUR FIRST TRANSGENDER PROVIDER FAIR AND I SEE I AM CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION MEN. CALIFORNIANS ADDITION FOR MAN AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF THE GIRLS IN TRANS WOMEN THAT OUR HOUSE IN MEN'S FACILITIES -- IS THAT THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR PROGRAMMING THAT THEY GET IS A VERY LIMITED AND I FEEL THAT THIS SPECIFIC ITEM -- WHAT THE ALLOW FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE THE SEED OF PROGRAMMING THAT THEY'VE ALREADY CREATED -- SOME HOPING WITH THIS SPECIFIC ITEM THAT. IT'S DIVIDED ENOUGH SO WE GET TO SERVE ALL THE COMMUNITIES THERE IN INCARCERATED IN PRISON BECAUSE IT'S TRULY. VITAL TO FINDING SUPPORT WHILE INSIDE AND ENSURING THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORT WHEN YOU'RE COMING US ALL.
