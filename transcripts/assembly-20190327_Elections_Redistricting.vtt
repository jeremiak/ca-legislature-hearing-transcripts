00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.579
PRETTY RURAL AND DON'T HAVE A

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.349
LOT OF RESOURCES TO TO BEGIN

00:41:58.415 --> 00:41:59.350

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:01.051
OF LARGER CONCERNS ON AND OF

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:02.519

RIGHT SO -- I UNDERSTAND IN

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:19.603
SEVEN THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP I'M

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.571
NOT SURE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE

00:42:20.638 --> 00:42:22.773

THAT THAT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.921
FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD HAVE IT

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:37.988
FOR MY COMMUNITY TAKEN ABOUT

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.256
SORT OF TAKING OVER AN HOUR TO

NOT WORKING FOLKS AND AND AND

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:55.606
THAT WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:56.273
LIKE MINE AND SO THAT'S ONE OF

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:56.941
THE THINGS WERE REALLY TRYING TO

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:57.541
GET AT IS HOW DO WE TAKE AWAY

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:58.409
ANY BARRIERS TO VOTING.

00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:00.177
I UNDERSTAND YES PEOPLE CAN --

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.879
ASK FOR AND GET A AN ABSENTEE

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:04.114
BALLOT -- AND WE'VE DONE A LOT

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:04.815
TO HELP.

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:06.183
SOLVE THAT WE YOU KNOW IT'S

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:07.718
GONNA BE POSTAGE PAID THEIR

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:08.919
THERE'S ALL WHAT WERE ADVANCING

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.587
A LOT OF WAYS BUT THERE ARE

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:11.622
STILL SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.923
RESISTANT TO DOING THAT THEY

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:14.425
WANT TO VOTE IN PERSON AND THEY

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:15.526
THEY WANT THAT OPPORTUNITY OR

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:16.427
THEY DON'T KNOW.

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.462
YET HOW TO TO REQUEST AN

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:20.297
ABSENTEE BALLOT SO WHAT WE'RE

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:21.699
TRYING TO DO IS ADD NUMBER ONE

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:22.800
EQUITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:24.702
WHEN WE HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.403
THE PEOPLE IN SAN DIEGO WHO

DON'T YET HAVE THE CA EVEN

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:29.406
THOUGH WE'RE TRYING -- HAVE

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:31.141
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES THE SAME

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:32.543
OPPORTUNITIES AS PEOPLE HAVE

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:34.912
MISTER MULLINS DISTRICT -- WHO

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.680
DIDN'T WAY FAR OUT THERE ON THIS

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:38.115
RIGHT -- AND THAT WE HAVE SOME

00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:39.783
EQUITY STATEWIDE AND I I THINK

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.251
EVEN THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:42.219
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.554
WHO WOULD APPRECIATE THAT TYPE

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.222

00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.666
IS IT IS THE GOAL HERE TO TO TRY

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.001

BERMAN ABSENTEE -- WE TALKED

00:44:05.642 --> 00:44:07.644
ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY --

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:08.779
SINCE I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:10.547
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC -- BUT TO

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:11.849
BE ABLE TO DO THAT TAKE YOU GET

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.150

UP WITH WITH THIS BILL.

00:44:18.555 --> 00:44:21.892
NOW I THINK THE GOAL IS THAT THE

00:44:21.959 --> 00:44:22.826
FACT I MEAN IT.

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:25.329
IN A WAY WHERE WERE OUT.

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:25.829
I THINK YOU'RE ASKING A

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:28.999
DIFFERENT QUESTION IS MY GOAL.

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.000
TO TO INSURE THE MORE CALORIES

00:44:30.067 --> 00:44:32.703
GO TO VOTER CHOICE ACT MODEL.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.004
YES THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN ASKING

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:35.873
A RECORD OF VOTE BY MAIL BECAUSE

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.341
VOTER CHOICE ACT MODEL THE THING

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.809
THAT'S SO WONDERFUL ABOUT IT IS

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.411
IT HAS THESE VOTE CENTERS IN THE

00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:42.880
ABILITY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL -- WHO

00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:44.615
YOU KNOW FROM THAT HAS LANGUAGE

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:46.750
ACCESS PROBLEMS MAYBE THAT HAS

00:44:46.817 --> 00:44:48.519
HAS NEVER VOTED BEFORE AN IS

00:44:48.585 --> 00:44:50.320
CONFUSED -- MAYBE SOMEBODY WHO

00:44:50.387 --> 00:44:52.790
IS DISABLED I CAN GO TO TO A

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.458
VOTE CENTER AND IT CAN HELP THEM

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.993
CAST THEIR BALLOTS IT DOESN'T

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.494
HAVE TO BE BY MAIL ONLY SO I'M

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.128
NOT.

00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:00.097
I'M NOT IN OF SUPPORT OF OF MALE

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.865
ONLY PROVIDING THAT IS THE ONLY

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:02.633
OPPORTUNITY THIS IS AN

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:04.168
ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO I

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.803
THINK IT'S A BETTER MODEL FOR

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:06.904
FOR COUNTIES TO GO TOWARDS OF

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.006
COURSE IT'S CHEAPER -- IT

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:11.008
PROVIDES THE THE FACT THAT A

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:12.276
BALLOT GETS IN EVERY SINGLE

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.844
VOTERS HANDED BEFORE THE

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:16.346
ELECTION I THINK THAT THAT'S AT

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.582
A POSITIVE YOU KNOW ATTRIBUTE TO

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:20.084
IT THAT WE ACTUALLY ARE.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.019
ARE TAKING AWAY PRETTY MUCH ANY

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.487
BARRIER TO VOTING AND I THINK

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.456
THAT THE VOTER CHOICE ACT MODEL

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:27.291
HELPS DO THAT -- BUT IN THOSE

00:45:27.357 --> 00:45:28.725
COUNTIES WERE RESISTANT TO

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:30.194
CHANGING TOWARD VAN I UNDERSTAND

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.362
THAT TOO WE SHOULDN'T PUT

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:33.797
INDIVIDUALS ADS -- BECAUSE THE

00:45:33.864 --> 00:45:35.132
INDIVIDUAL COURSE VOTER DOESN'T

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:37.468
HAVE AT AT A REAL STRONG --

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.436
VOICE IN THAT OPTION RIGHT IT'S

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:42.172
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS --

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:42.940
THE I GUESS THEY CAN TALK TO THE

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:43.740
COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISOR BUT

00:45:43.807 --> 00:45:45.209
THEY'RE NOT REALLY HAVING THEY

00:45:45.275 --> 00:45:46.009
THEY COULD STILL BE DENIED THE

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:47.711
OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE EARLY AS A

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.680
RESULT OF THAT THE FACT THAT

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:50.247
THERE COUNTY DIDN'T GO THAT

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:50.814
OPTION.

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:55.452
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE

00:45:55.519 --> 00:45:57.454
AWAY THAT DISPARITY.

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:58.188
HIS ROSTER.

00:45:58.255 --> 00:45:59.022
REAL QUICKLY IS IT AND I GUESS

00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.723
THAT'S ONE OF MY THAT'S MY

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.858
CONCERN IS LIKE A LOT OF US DO

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:02.993
OUT HAVE THE TRADITIONAL MODEL.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.027
AND ACTION YOU KNOW I MEAN THIS

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:05.095
IS OBVIOUSLY MY EXPERIENCE YOUR

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:06.430
EXPERIENCES SAN DIEGO'S

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:08.332
DIFFERENT BUT WE HAVE REALLY

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:09.900
HIGH TURN OUT RIGHT I MEAN ARE

IN THE STATE.

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:16.140

KIND OF LIKE.

00:46:21.345 --> 00:46:23.347
THIS SEEMS TO PUT MORE COST ON

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:26.016
THOSE PEOPLE FOR FOR CHOOSING.

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.284
T. TO ADOPT THAT MORE
