00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.628
STORAGE. LOOKING AT ABOUT

00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:51.764
TRIPLING THE SIZE OF. AND

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.265
DISORDER WIND SO TAKING ALL

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:55.067
INTO. AS KNOW WHAT IT'S AN

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:56.068
INCREDIBLE CHAO. TO BE ABLE TO

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:58.137
MAKE SURE- WE GET THEIR- ARE

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:00.839
THE I THINK YOU. NO WHICH OVER

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:04.777
THE PRO. OF THE- THIS CALL.

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.912
TAKING STEPS AND IT'S TO TALK.

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:09.515
LEVEL AND HOW- GIGAWATT OF NEW

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:12.017
ENERGY SOURCE. TO GET TO TWENTY

00:14:12.084 --> 00:14:12.985
AND I THINK THIS WILL COUNTY TO

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:22.895
THAT UP. I'M AS WE GO. I'M LIKE

00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:23.529
I'M NOT SURE I'M CONVENE WE'RE

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:25.264
GOING TO THE GOAL THAT I IT'S

00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:26.065
ITS IMPORTANT HAVE A GO AND

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.199
THEN ELSEWHERE CLOSE AND CLOSER

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:29.068
ON CERTAINLY THE- BILL WHO ARE

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:31.036
THE F. IN THE IN THE- THE-

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:32.638
PARTICULAR ARENA- LIKE YOURS.

WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE GARDEN AS

00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.374
WERE APPROACH. I THINK SOME.

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:37.076
BECAUSE OF WERE NOT. YOU KNOW

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:38.877
WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT CLOSE IN

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:40.913
FIVE YEARS SOME NEW DIRECTIVE

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.281
NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AND

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:45.818
CERTAINLY SOME OF THAT BROUGHT

00:14:45.884 --> 00:14:46.418
BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE. THE

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:47.820
AREA THAT OF CONCERNING TO ME

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:48.721
AND I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A QUICK

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:50.823
BACKGROUND. I THINK IT WAS IN

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:52.191
THE FORTIES OR THE FIFTIES I

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.359
JUST HEARD MY PARENTS TALKING

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:55.761
ABOU. THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:57.830
WAS LOOKING AT AN ALL ELECTRIC

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.565
HOME THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG. A

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.800
BIG THING IF YOU WERE. IN THAT

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:03.335
AGE RANGE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.271
BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME. AND MY

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.572
PARENTS I THINK WE'RE

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:09.208
APPROACHING THAT. AND DECIDED

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.709
THAT OUT OF THE DIDN'T WALK OUT

00:15:10.776 --> 00:15:12.645
BECAUSE OF STUDIES THAT MIGHT

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:14.013
BE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME I'M

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.481
ASSUMING BECAUSE OF THE STORIES

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:17.916
I WAS HEARING. WAS THAT IT WAS

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:19.218
GOING TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE SO

00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:22.488
THEY OPTED FOR GAS OR NATURAL

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:24.523
GAS. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.292
ON NOW WE'RE GOING TO TOTAL.

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:27.593
DIFFERENT DIRECTION BECAUSE

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.694
HOME BUILDERS I THINK WE'RE

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.129
STARTING TO NOT REQUIRE THAT

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.196
ARE PUT THAT IN MANY OF THEIR

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:32.831
HOMES. THEY WEREN'T SELLING FOR

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.700
THAT VERY REASON. FOR NOW WE'RE

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.235
GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:37.736
GOING BACK TO ALL ELECTRICITY

00:15:37.803 --> 00:15:39.038
IN THE HOMES AND GETTING RID OF

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:41.340
ALL THE NATURAL GAS. AND I AM

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:42.741
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAT

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:45.177
IF WE DO HAVE. BLACKOUTS WE DO

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:47.246
HAVE. YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:48.614
OF REACHING THE GOAL BUILDING

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.715
THE GREAT BIG ENOUGH TO

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.116
ACCOMMODATE ALL THIS GOING TO

00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:54.086
BE DEPENDENT ON IT. IF WE

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:56.622
ELIMINATE GAS COMPLETELY. OF

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:59.158
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN IS THAT

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.627
IS THAT A GOOD POLICY TO

00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:03.529
IMMEDIATELY BE SAYING WE HAVE

00:16:03.595 --> 00:16:05.764
TO YOU KNOW REMOVE THAT AT THIS

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:07.666
POINT IN TIME WITHOUT ANY REAL

00:16:07.733 --> 00:16:09.902
STUDY SHOWING US HOW MUCH WE'RE

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:10.502
GOING TO NEED AND WHETHER WE

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.438
CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT IN THE TIME

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:14.406
THAT'S BEEN GIVEN THROUGH A

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:14.840
VERY AS PIECE OF THE

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:19.111
LEGISLATION. I THANK YOU AGAIN

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:20.412
SENATOR ASKED THE BOARD FOR THE

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.147
CLEAN PARKING QUESTION AND I

00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:23.615
JUST WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:16:23.682 --> 00:16:25.884
TO SHARE. AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:27.219
OF THAT YOU KNOW AS AS WE

00:16:27.286 --> 00:16:31.123
LOOKED AT- OF SEVERAL PATHWAYS.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.325
FOR REACHING OUR CLIMATE GOALS.

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:35.327
IT IS. IT IS KIND OF AGREED

00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:38.430
UPON- BROAD CONSENSUS NOT. TO

00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:39.131
HAVE AN IDEA OF ANALYTICAL

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:41.567
WORK. ON THAT YEAH LIKE TO

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:44.002
VACATION OF BUILDINGS. AND THE

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.970
SPECIFICALLY DEFINITION AND

00:16:45.037 --> 00:16:46.672
COMMERCIAL AS WELL AS THE

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.474
ELECTRIFICATION OF LIGHT DUTY.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.109
VEHICLES IS THE MOST COST

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:51.176
EFFECTIVE PATHWAY TO

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:53.212
DECARBONIZING OUR ECONOMY. I'M

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.980
SO AND AS YOU NOTED I THINK YOU

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:57.015
KNOW THAT THANKS MOST OF THE-

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:58.350
WORK THAT THE AGENCIES ARE

00:16:58.417 --> 00:17:00.619
COLLECTIVELY DOING- IS

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:02.121
BASICALLY UNDERPINNED BY THAT

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:05.290
ANALYSIS THAT THE EDUCATION. IS

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.892
AN IMPORTANT PATHWAY. I DO ALSO

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.594
NOTED IN A THERE'S A NUMBER OF

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.495
THINGS WE NEED TO BE VERY

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.163
THOUGHTFUL AND MINDFUL ABOUT.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.364
YOU KNOW HOW DESPERATE THE

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.467
CHANGE AND THE DEMAND PATTERNS.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.668
FOR EXAMPLE HOW MUCH OF THAT

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:18.637
INCREASE BUT ALSO HOW MUCH OF

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.238
THE- IMPACT DURING THE PEAK

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.340
TIMES. PARTICULARLY ON THE GAS

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:22.841
SIDE AS YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.643
OF ELECTRIFICATION. WHAT DOES

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.845
THAT DO YOU- IN TERMS OF A GAS

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:28.914
USAGE. BOTH BOTH ADDRESS SYSTEM

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:31.083
LEVEL BUT ALSO AT A LOCAL LEVEL

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.917
SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:34.153
QUESTIONS THAT ASK IF HE'S HE'S

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.521
REALLY TRYING TO TACKLE THIS

00:17:35.587 --> 00:17:37.189
YEAR IN THE AYE PROCESS.

00:17:37.256 --> 00:17:38.724
UNIMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE CC

00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:40.893
IS TO. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN

00:17:40.959 --> 00:17:42.094
UNDERPINNING ANALYTICAL

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.762
UNDERPINNING FOR THE STATE AND

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:45.397
OUT OF THE NECESSARY OPTIONS TO

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:46.198
THINK THROUGH THIS GOAL

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.700
BUCKLEY. SO IN THIS AYE BURKE-

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.235
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS

00:17:50.302 --> 00:17:52.204
WERE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION.

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.806
I'M AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.274
AS WELL AS NATURAL GAS AS A

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.075
WHOLE. LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT IS

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:59.344
THE DIFFERENT- DEMAND FUTURES

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.013
COULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT DOES

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.514
THAT MEAN I'VE COME A COUPLE

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.450
EXTEND POINT- AS WELL AS

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:06.185
RELIABILITY STANDPOINT. AND

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.085
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:08.320
ACTIVELY THINKING TO AND WHAT

00:18:08.387 --> 00:18:10.456
ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE WE WORK

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:23.001

DEEPER DE INTO ROOMS OF. HAVING

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.173
NOT LEAVE FOR BACK ON. IN THE

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.107
OF THE OF ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO

YEARS AND NOT BECAUSE IT WAS

00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.554
NEVER BECAUSE OF THE HUGE

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.623
DEMAND. ON THE GRID AT THAT

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.125
TIME IT WAS NOT DURING THE BE

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:47.626
VERY WARM WEATHER THAT WAS

WHEN. THEY WERE DIGGING NEW

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:51.497
PIPES OR DEVELOPMENTS AND-

00:18:51.563 --> 00:18:52.631
ACTUALLY RAN INTO LINES UNDER

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:54.500
THE- UNDER THE HIGHWAYS THAT

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:56.869
CUT ELECTRICITY TO MY HOME. A

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.237
COUPLE TIMES I DURING THE

DEVELOP A LEGAL YEARS IN SOUTH

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.740
ORANGE COUNTY WHERE I LIVE. AND

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.842
WE HAD GAS GAS STOVE AND A GAS

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:06.078
DRYER SIMPLE I COULD CONTINUE

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:07.946
TO COOK. BY CANDLELIGHT AND

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:08.847

TOWARDS A CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.584
TWENTY FORTY FIVE. I WE WERE

00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:27.586

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.337
YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON. THE BUDGET

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:10.541
ON- THE GRIT AND OUR GRID

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:13.210
SECURITY AND WHAT YOU THINK ARE

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:15.145
SOME OF THE GREATEST THREATS.

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:17.114
ARM TO OUR GREAT SECURITY IN

00:45:17.181 --> 00:45:19.883
CALIFORNIA- AND ARE YOU

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.052
CONCERNED THAT ARE GREAT COULD

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:26.056
SUCCUMB TO. THREATS SIMILAR TO-

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:30.794
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE. YES AND

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.463
NO WHICH IS NOT A GREAT ANSWER

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.565
BUT LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT

00:45:34.631 --> 00:45:38.102
FIRST I WILL SAY. OF IT IS

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:39.336
DIFFERENT IN THAT THE ELECTRIC

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.071
GRID IS OPERATED UNDER

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:42.840
MANDATORY CYBERSECURITY

00:45:42.906 --> 00:45:44.408
STANDARDS BOTH PHYSICAL

00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:45.175
SECURITY CRITICAL

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.277
INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AS

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:50.180
WELL AS CYBER SECURITY IT

00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:52.316
SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY ETCETERA

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.017
THE GAS INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW DOES

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.586
NOT HAVE ANY STANDARDS THAT

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.187
THEY HAVE TO MEET AND THAT WAS

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.388
PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH WHAT

00:45:58.455 --> 00:46:00.257
HAPPENED WITH THAT PIPELINE

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:01.758
FAILURE AND THERE'S A BIG

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:02.893
ARGUMENT GOING ON RIGHT NOW

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.194
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT MAYBE THE

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.529
GAS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO MOVE IN

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:06.663
THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRIC

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.465
SECTOR SO WE DO HAVE MORE

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:11.468
PROTECTION. FOR THE GRIP. THEN

00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:13.203
THE GAS PIPELINE SYSTEM DOESN'T

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.671
IN THE COUNTRY THE WORRYING

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:15.672
THOUGHT THOUGH IS THAT WE DO

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:17.241
HAVE A LOT OF RELIANCE ACROSS

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.243
THE NATION. IN MEETING OUR

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:21.512
ELECTRIC GRID MEANS WITH GAS

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:23.714
PIPELINE SUPPLY SOURCES SO IT

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.549
IS A BIG ISSUE. THERE ARE TWO

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:28.485
KINDS OF. CHALLENGES I THINK ON

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:30.420
THE CYBER FRONT COMING OFF OF

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:31.822
THE NEW RECORD WASTE A LOT OF

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:33.457
TIME WORKING ON THIS WEEK'S WE

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:34.992
FOCUSED ON NATION STATE

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:37.828
CHALLENGES AND THIS IS REALLY

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:38.962
TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.898
OF STUFF THE STUFF MAYBE BEING

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.133
CARRIED OUT BY RUSSIAN MY CHINA

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.402
MY NORTH KOREA BY IRAN ALL THE

00:46:45.469 --> 00:46:46.703
COUNTRIES THAT MAYBE ACTUALLY

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.273
ATTEMPTING TO HACK THE GRID AND

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:50.374
TAKE IT DOWN FOR. ILLEGAL OR

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.609
MILITARY REASONS. AND THEN THE

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:53.744
SECOND ONE AND THIS IS WHAT

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.312
WE'RE REALLY STARTING TO SEE

00:46:55.379 --> 00:46:57.681
HAVE A LOOTING. GOING ON THIS

00:46:57.748 --> 00:46:59.983
YEAR IS RANSOMWARE. YOU HAVE

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.185
PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:04.354
WANT THEIR CRIMINALS AND THEY

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.889
YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATE HAS

00:47:05.956 --> 00:47:07.524
ALREADY TAKEN SOME GOOD STEPS

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:10.027
AS COMMISSIONER- THE NEW JUST

00:47:10.093 --> 00:47:11.195
TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF HAVING A

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:13.197
CENTRAL. FOCUS OFFICE TO TRY

00:47:13.263 --> 00:47:15.165
AND WORK ON THESE ISSUES. BUT I

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:17.301
DO THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:19.703
EVERY COMPANY HAVE BOTH GOOD

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.905
TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS WHERE

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.807
THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO. STOP THE

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:25.375
ASSAULTS THEY'RE COMING IN AS

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:26.743
WELL AS TRAINING OF STAFF

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.445
BECAUSE WE'RE DISCOVERING THAT

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:29.246
A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE

00:47:29.313 --> 00:47:31.582
COMING IN. THROUGH EMAILS AND

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.017
PHISHING ATTACKS AND- EMPLOYEES

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:35.052
OPENING THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:36.987
BE OPENING SO I CAN ASSURE YOU

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:39.122
THAT. MY LIMITED TIME SO FAR ON

00:47:39.189 --> 00:47:41.425
THE ISO BOARD. IT'S CLEAR THAT

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.626
THE ISO ENGAGES IN THOSE

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.094
ACTIVITIES I KNOW THAT THAT

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:47.664
ALSO. IS THAT KIND OF TRAINING.

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.199
THAT KIND OF- THE SECURITY

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:51.101
SYSTEM SUPPORT IS BEING DONE BY

00:47:51.168 --> 00:47:52.836
ALL THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:54.638
THAT ARE. MORE OR REGISTERED

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:55.806
ENTITIES THAT ARE UNDER THE

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:57.741
NETWORK MANDATORY CYBERSECURITY

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.744
STANDARDS. SO IT MIGHT CONTENT

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:01.878
TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOW EVERY

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:03.180
MORNING I GET UP AND IT SEEMS

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.081
TO ME WE'RE SEEING SOME NEW

00:48:04.147 --> 00:48:06.350
CHALLENGE THAT'S COME OUT.

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:07.284
BECAUSE THIS IS AN EVOLVING

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.286
AREA I DO THINK THE ELECTRIC

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:11.822
SECTOR IS POSITION BETTER THAN

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:13.557
THE GAS SECTOR RIGHT NOW. THANK

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:16.460
YOU FOR THAT- INCREDIBLY

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:20.030

SUPPORT BRINGING MORE STORAGE

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:41.251
TECHNOLOGY ON TO THE GRADE WE

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.287
HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN SO MANY

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:44.388
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:47.924
KINDS OF- ENERGY THAT ARE OUT

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:48.859
HERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:50.360

OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS I BELIEVE

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:11.381
HERE IN. IN US- LA MOM. I THINK

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:12.983
IT'S AN EXCITING TIME FOR

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.652
BATTERY STORAGE ON RIGHT NOW WE

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:16.787
HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:18.221
MEGAWATTS ON THE GRID THAT

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.457
WE'VE WE FULLY INTEGRATED-

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:21.725

ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:28.065
MEGAWATTS THE CQC HAS

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.299
COMMISSION THAT'S HEADING FOR

00:49:29.366 --> 00:49:31.868
US THE END OF THIS SUMMER I

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:33.370
THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT

I'VE NEVER SERVED ON THE ENERGY

00:52:02.452 --> 00:52:04.154
OF COMMITTEES ARE- WHILE I'VE

00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:06.556
BEEN A PUBLIC. ELECTED

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:08.992

LEVEL AND NOW UP HERE SO I

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.395
LEARNED SO MUCH EACH TIME WE GO

THROUGH ONE OF THESE THESE-

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:16.099

CONCERN TO ME AS- THE- MASSIVE

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.244
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WE MIGHT

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.779
BE LOOKING OUT. AS WE TRIED TO

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:30.881
IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:33.083
ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE I

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.985
THINK THE- ENERGY COMMISSION

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:38.021
NOT RECENTLY- REPORTED THAT

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:39.656
DEGRADE NEEDS THE EXPAND BE

00:52:39.723 --> 00:52:42.626
EXPANDED THREE FOLD AND-

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.994
PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN MATCHING

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.029
AND- WILL NEED TO OVER A

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:48.431
MILLION- A CHARGING STATIONS TO

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:49.399

TALKING FROM MY RESEARCH HERE

00:52:52.402 --> 00:52:53.336
PRESENTED TO ME ON ABOUT EIGHT

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.739
MILLION. ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.907
COULD BE ON THE ROAD AT THAT

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:58.842
TIME SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:00.510
AS WE'RE APPROACHING THAT TIME

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:02.379
AND WHAT THOSE COSTS MIGHT BE A

00:53:02.445 --> 00:53:04.481
HOW WE MANAGE THOSE I'M

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:05.815
CONCERNED THAT IF IT FALLS ON

00:53:05.882 --> 00:53:06.816
RATE PAYERS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.885
THE SAME SITUATION THAT WE HAVE

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:11.321
WITH OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:13.990
HAVING- YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:15.325
TO MEET SOME OF THE COSTS THAT

THEY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE NOW SO.

00:53:17.093 --> 00:53:23.266
JUST KIND OF AN OPEN. ENDED

00:53:23.333 --> 00:53:23.800

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:36.279
CHALLENGING AND I WOULDN'T. YOU

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:37.380

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:39.549

THE TRENCHES YOU KNOW EITHER

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:47.991
WORKING ON PROGRAMS OR MANAGING

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.626
UTILITY LIKE G. AND YOU KNOW

00:53:49.693 --> 00:53:51.561
YOU CAN'T JUST JUMP INTO THIS

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:52.929
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU GET THERE

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:54.564
SENATOR IT'S STILL LIKE THEY'RE

00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:56.333
SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE YOU

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.334
LIKE YOU'VE LANDED ON THE MOON

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.302
I CAN'T AS A NEW CONDITION

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.804
MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCES A COUPLE

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.739
TIMES EVEN WITH ALL HER UTILITY

00:54:02.806 --> 00:54:04.474
EXPERIENCE THAT THAT THAT

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:05.775
THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN AND

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:07.143
ACTUALLY WHAT THAT'S WHAT MAKES

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:08.945
IT REALLY A GREAT PLACE TO BE

00:54:09.012 --> 00:54:10.246
BECAUSE YOU TAKE ALL YOUR

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:11.481
EXPERIENCE AND YOU COMBINE IT

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:12.482
WITH THE THINGS YOU NEED TO

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:13.984
KNOW. AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.086
GET A BETTER RESULT BECAUSE WE

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.554
ARE NOT THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:19.255
SENATOR THE TACKLE IS FOR ITS

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:20.690
FOR THE OUTSTANDING STAFF OF

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.925
THE ICE SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:23.927
IN GOVERNMENT ON AND OFF FOR

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.161
THIRTY YEARS AND I'VE SEEN A

00:54:25.228 --> 00:54:26.596
LOT OF PLACES OPERATE BUT THE

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:29.466
ICE SO IS A IS A TOP NOTCH

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:30.600
OPERATION I MEAN THE

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.869
PROFESSIONALISM OF THIS GROUP

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:34.971
IS REALLY INSPIRING YEAH I

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:36.439
THINK THEY'RE PROBLEM SOLVERS

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:37.641
AND THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:40.176
TECHNICAL SKILLS AND THAT'S WHY

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.578
I'M OPTIMISTIC I'M JUST I'M NOT

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.313
OPTIMISTIC FOR NO REASON YOU

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.215
KNOW I LIKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:46.883
HAVE TO BE CONVINCED SOMETIMES

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.251
YOU SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT YOU

00:54:48.318 --> 00:54:49.486
KNOW I WOULD. ACTUALLY BE ABLE

00:54:49.552 --> 00:54:51.221
TO DO THAT SO IN THE SPIRIT OF

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.756
THAT I DO NOT THINK THE

00:54:52.822 --> 00:54:53.990
GOVERNOR HAS ENTERED INTO THIS

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.592
COMMITMENT LIGHTLY I THINK HE

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.927
HAS THOROUGHLY ANALYZED IT AND

00:54:57.994 --> 00:54:59.529
TAKING A LOOK AT IT AND I THINK

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:01.197
HE DOES NOT WANT TO COST MORE

00:55:01.264 --> 00:55:02.265
AND I THINK WHAT WHAT HE'S

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:03.833
THINKING IS THAT

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.835
ELECTRIFICATION IS KEY TO

00:55:05.902 --> 00:55:07.137
GETTING TRIED 2% RENEWABLE

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:09.272
GOALS IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:10.640
AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:16.946
BECAUSE. IT DOES CREATE MORE.

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:18.281
THE MAN. THE THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:19.015
BUT THERE ARE MORE PAID PEOPLE

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:20.316
PAY INTO THE GRIT. AND

00:55:20.383 --> 00:55:21.551
HOPEFULLY THOSE COSTS ARE

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:23.319
LOWER. THAN WHAT THEY WOULD BE

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:24.788
PAYING FOR OTHER FORMS OF.

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:27.357
ENERGY SO I THINK THAT OUR

00:55:27.424 --> 00:55:29.859
FRIENDS AT THE CC. COMMISSIONER

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.861
OCCURRING THAT ARE REALLY THE

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:32.929
ONES WHO HAVE DONE THE FOR

00:55:32.996 --> 00:55:34.764
CASTING TO TELL US WHAT WE NEED

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:35.665
THEY'RE TELLING US WE'RE GOING

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.267
TO NEED AS YOU SAID AT LEAST

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.235
ONE POINT TWO MILLION CHARGERS.

00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:41.638
AT LEAST EIGHT MILLION EV'S

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:42.772
THEY'RE THEY'RE FIGURING WILL

00:55:42.839 --> 00:55:43.840
BE ON THE ROAD AND THAT'S

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:44.774
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:46.776
APPROXIMATELY I THINK ABOUT

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:47.410
EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.679
ENERGY. NOW AT THE ICE SO WHAT

00:55:49.746 --> 00:55:52.982
WE DO IS WE STUDY. AND ANALYZE

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:55.018
THAT AND THERE ARE PROTOCOLS IN

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:56.519
THERE ARE PROCESSES THAT ARE

00:55:56.586 --> 00:55:58.254
REQUIRED AND THAT'S- THAT'S THE

00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.956
STAGE RING SENATOR IS THAT

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:02.025
WORK. OR ANALYZING RIGHT NOW

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.626
HOW THAT WILL WORK IN OUR

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:05.962
ABILITY TO. TO INTEGRATE IT BUT

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.630
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE GIVEN

00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:08.998
EVERYTHING ELSE I'VE SEEN AYE

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:10.667
SO INTEGRATE. THAT THEY WILL BE

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:12.669
ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THEY WILL

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:13.536
BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF COST

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:17.741
EFFECTIVE. WAY AND AS YOU KNOW.

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:18.908
BUT I SO HAVE AN ENERGY ABOUT

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.510
MARKET WITH ABOUT. ENTITIES

00:56:20.577 --> 00:56:23.146
RIGHT NOW WILL HELP ALMOST

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.348
TWENTY THREE IN TWO YEARS 180%

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.350
OF THE WESTERN GREAT WITHIN.

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:29.119
THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND SO WE

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:31.121
ARE SPREADING. THE OPPORTUNITY

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:33.256
AND THE RISK ACROSS THE WESTERN

00:56:33.323 --> 00:56:35.325
GREAT IN AND THE SAVINGS THAT

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.659
HAVE COME FROM THIS

00:56:36.726 --> 00:56:39.295
INTERACTION. MEANS THAT WE HAVE

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:41.765
SAVE MONEY IN TERMS OF- OF

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.366
DELIVERING ELECTRICITY WILL

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:46.736
ALSO BE ABLE TO. MOVE POWER

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:47.871
THAT WEWOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:51.274
CURTAIL INTO. OTHER MARKETS AND

00:56:51.341 --> 00:56:53.309
I THINK IT WILL BE A REALLY

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:55.912
IMPORTANT PART OF- OUR SUMMER

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.947
READING S. BECAUSE LAST SUMMER.

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:59.582
THE E. I AM PRODUCING

00:56:59.649 --> 00:57:00.950
ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN HUNDRED

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:01.951
MEGAWATTS WHEN WE WERE

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:03.586
EXPERIENCING TIGHT SUPPLY SO

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:05.522
THAT WAS CRITICAL. SO WE HAVE

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:07.557
PARTNERS IN THIS WE HAVE WAYS

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.859
TO REDUCE OUR COSTS- AND I DO

00:57:09.926 --> 00:57:13.863
FEEL CONFIDENT. WE'LL BE ABLE

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:14.497
TO DO IT EVERY SIX CALLS. SEVEN

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:17.233
THE CONSUMER AGREE US OUT THERE.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.501
WELL WHENEVER AGAIN GIVEN

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.503
ANOTHER DIME ON THE UTILITY

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.238
BILL THEY'RE NOT REAL HAPPY SO.

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:24.440
ANYWAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND I

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:26.009
WOULD HOPE THAT BECAUSE YOU

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:27.744
SEEM TO HAVE VERY STRONG

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:29.078
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE THREE

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:32.482
ENTITIES THE I SO THE EASY AND

00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:33.783
P. YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE WORKING

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:35.552
TOGETHER THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.654
REPORT I KNOW THE LAST ONE THAT

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.489
WAS PRODUCES TWENTY SEVENTEEN-

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:40.990
THAT'S PROBABLY ANTIQUATED NOW

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.258
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A-

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:43.493
FEW MORE CHALLENGES SINCE THEY

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.862
ON. THAT THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING

00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:48.264
VERY TANGIBLE THAT WE CAN START

00:57:48.331 --> 00:57:50.099
TO SHARE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:51.935
WHO ARE THE CONSUMERS AND FOR

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:53.203
THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE WHEN

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.671
THINGS GO WRONG OUT THERE LIKE

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:56.372
WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY DIDN'T.

00:57:56.439 --> 00:57:58.641
OF THINGS WORK THE WAY WE HOPE

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.076
THEY WERE OR THE WAY THEY WERE

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.011
PROMISED SO IF YOU COULD GIVE

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:05.448
US SOME EXTRA ENERGY TO THAT-

00:58:05.515 --> 00:58:07.116
AND GETTING A REPORT OUT AND

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:08.751
SOMETHING TO THE LEGISLATORS.

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:10.653
EARLIER THAN LATER THAT WILL BE

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.789
EXTREMELY HELPFUL- TO ALL FOR

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.257

BLACKOUTS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.034
THERE WAS A LOT OF THE BLAME

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.936
GAME GOING ON WHICH IS PART OF

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:27.937
OUR THEIR ARENA THAT WE ALL

00:58:28.004 --> 00:58:30.006

OUR LIVES THAT ARE FLOOD SO YOU

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:36.779
YOU WERE ON THE FRONT LINES

00:58:36.846 --> 00:58:38.281
THAT CERTAINLY THROUGH A NUMBER

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.884
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CAME

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:44.187
WITH THIS EXTREMOPHILE. IN YOUR

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:46.356
SERVICE SO HOW ARE WE LOOKING

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.400
THAT MIGHT TO FALL OFF. WELL

00:58:57.467 --> 00:58:59.002
JUST BEFORE YOU GET ON THIS THE

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:00.703
THIS MEETING. I AT THE ONE TIME

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:01.971
WEATHER REPORT AND SAW THAT

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:03.006
SACRAMENTO IS GOING TO BE A

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.507
HUNDRED AND EIGHT AND A HUNDRED

00:59:04.574 --> 00:59:05.608
NINE THIS WEEKEND RIGHT.

00:59:05.675 --> 00:59:07.443
FORTUNATELY IT'S ON THE WEEKEND

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:09.812
WHICH HELPS THE GRID- BUT ON

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:10.947
THE OTHER HAND THEY HAVE THOSE

00:59:11.014 --> 00:59:12.415
KIND OF TEMPERATURES BECAUSE I

00:59:12.482 --> 00:59:14.250
USED TO WHEN I STILL WORKED ITS

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:16.286
MIND AS YOU MENTIONED. UP TO

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:16.953
MONITORING VERY CLOSELY

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.522
BECAUSE- LOTUS VERY MUCH DRIVEN

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:21.524
BY AIR CONDITIONING. AND AIR

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:22.859
CONDITIONING IS DRIVEN BY

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:23.893
TEMPERATURE AND WE ALL KNOW

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.662
THAT AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.230
SAW LAST SUMMER IS THAT THE

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:28.831
TEMPERATURE OF THE HIGH TEMPS

00:59:28.898 --> 00:59:30.600
DIDN'T HIT JUST IN CALIFORNIA.

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.101
THEY HIT EVERYWHERE AND WE'VE

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:34.170
ALREADY SEEN THAT. THIS YEAR

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.673
WITH REALLY ALARMINGLY HEIGHT

00:59:36.739 --> 00:59:38.574
RECORD SETTING TEMPERATURES IN

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.877
BRITISH COLUMBIA. IN SEATTLE

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:42.679
AND PORTLAND WITH THE SERIOUS

00:59:42.745 --> 00:59:44.280
CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:59:44.347 --> 00:59:47.450
DIDN'T HAVE COOLING CENTERS AND

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:48.117
THEY WERE PREPARED TO HANDLE IT.

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:49.218
I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US

00:59:49.285 --> 00:59:51.054
GOING INTO THE SUMMER IS THAT

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.456
WE- PUT TOGETHER AS MANY

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.758
SOLUTIONS JOINTLY FIRST I WANT

00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:57.060
TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:59.295
COMMISSION THE ISO. AND THE

00:59:59.362 --> 01:00:00.129
ENERGY COMMISSION FOR WORKING

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:01.230
HAND IN GLOVE AND THE

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.399
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I'M- TRYING

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:04.934
TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD DO.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.703
IT FOR THE SUMMER WHAT WE

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:07.971
DIDN'T THANK OR WHAT I DIDN'T

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:09.072
THINK AT THE TIME IS THIS

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:11.407
SUMMER MEANS NOW NOT AUGUST

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:14.610
INSPECT HIM- LIKE IT WAS LAST

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:15.211
YEAR WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.512
HIGH TEMPERATURES. SO WE DO

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:19.916
HAVE MORE GENERATION WE HAVE.

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:22.151
ALL SERIES OF MARKET MAJORS

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:24.320
THAT WERE JUST APPROVED BY FURK

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:25.922
UNDER THE ISO TERRACE THAT

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:27.623
HOPEFULLY WILL HELP BRING MORE

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.926
ENERY AND WHEN WE NEED IT- WE

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:32.028
ALSO HAVE NEW PROVISIONS THAT

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:34.897
RELATE TO. RESOURCE ADEQUACY TO

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:37.000
MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANTS AND

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.534
PROJECTS AND DEMAND SIDE

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.236
RESOURCES THAT WERE COUNTING ON

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.338
DURING THESE CRITICAL PERIODS

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.640
WILL ACTUALLY BE THERE. SO

01:00:44.707 --> 01:00:45.641
WE'RE TIGHTENINGUP ON HOW TO

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:47.377
COUNT THE MAN RESPONSE

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:49.979
RESOURCES WERE REQUIRING UNITS-

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.848
POWER PLANTS THAT NEED TO TAKES

01:00:51.914 --> 01:00:53.816
SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE OUTAGES

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.418
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR STANDBY

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:57.186
ENERGY AVAILABLE TO COVER FOR

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.388
THEM BEING GONE. THERE'S A

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.456
WHOLE LIST OF MAJORS AND I FEEL

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:03.860
LIKE. A LOT OF THE VERY HARD

01:01:03.926 --> 01:01:05.595
WORK HAS BEEN PUT INTO TRYING

01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:07.196
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.599
TO EKE OUT EVERY LAST. HELLO

01:01:09.665 --> 01:01:11.901
AND KILOWATT HOUR THAT WE CAN

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.269
TO BE READY FOR WHAT IS.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.170
PROVING TO BE A VERY TOUGH

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.271
SUMMER WE'RE ALREADY SEEING

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.472
THOSE VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:17.673
AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:20.476
DROUGHT IN AS A RESULT WE END

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:22.178
UP WITH LESS HYDROELECTRIC.

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:23.513
PRODUCTION SO YOU MAY HAVE SEEN

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:25.481
SOME SOMETHING IN THE NEWS THIS

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:26.282
LAST WEEK THAT AGAIN IN

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.484
PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE P. YOU

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:30.219
SEE IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION.

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:31.521
THE ISO IS NOW OUT ON THE

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:33.556
STREETS I THINK THEY'RE

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.258
SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING THE

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.794
PROPOSAL STAND TODAY. FOR SOME

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.695
ADDITIONAL POWER TO COVER WHAT

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.664
WE ARE NOW ANTICIPATING IS EVEN

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:44.033
POTENTIALLY. A BIGGER ISSUE

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.101
THAN WHAT WE FORESAW A FEW

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:46.502
MONTHS AGO. SO IT'S VERY

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.571
CHALLENGING I DO THINK THAT

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:52.041
PEOPLE. REFOCUS COLLABORATING.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:52.875
AND I THINK EVERYONE

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.677
UNDERSTANDS THE SERIOUSNESS OF

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:55.711
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:57.313
PARTICULARLY AS YOU MENTIONED

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.816
WITH MICE MY BACKGROUND AND

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:00.416
HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE FIRST

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:02.385
ENERGY CRISIS. I KNOW WHAT IT'S

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.820
LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ARE STUCK IN

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:04.854
ELEVATORS ARE WHEN THEY'RE

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.489
REFRIGERATION FAILS AT THE

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.391
GROCERY STORE AND THEY CAN'T.

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:09.325
CONTINUE TO SELL THE FOOD

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.927
BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE VIOLATING

01:02:10.993 --> 01:02:12.161
THE HEALTH STANDARDS BECAUSE IT

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:13.563
HASN'T BEEN REFRIGERATED OR ON

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:15.965
ICE LONG ENOUGH. HOSPITALS THAT

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:16.999
HAVE TO GO ON BACK UP

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.001
GENERATORS WORK THE SHERIFF

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.704
CALLING SOMEONE NEEDS. TO TALK

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:22.672
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE TRAFFIC

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:25.074
LIGHTS AREN'T WORKING AND

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.209
HAVING A LOT OF THE- ALL THESE

01:02:26.275 --> 01:02:28.511
WITH TRAFFIC. SO IT'S FROM THE

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:30.746
BUT IT DOESN'T TO THE SMALL BUT

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.982
IT'S NEVER SMALL TO THE PERSON

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.784
WHO'S EXPERIENCING AT. I CAN

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.285
JUST ASSURE YOU THAT I DO THINK

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:38.421
THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.123
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE DONE

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.324
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BE READY

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.892
FOR IT. BUT WE ARE IN FOR A

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.594
TOUGH SUMMER YEAH SO THAT WOULD

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:45.928
BE MY ASSESSMENT WE ARE RIGHT

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.997
NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:49.899
MAJORITY BUT I THINK WHAT WAS

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:50.833
REALLY CAME THROUGH IN YOUR

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.002
DISCUSSION IS THAT BASED ON

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.604
WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR- WE'RE

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.572

DEBATES ARE DECISIONS. WHEN

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.308
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY THIS IS

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.310
HOW THAT THIS WALL OF REFLECT

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.779

HIS SMILING A LITTLE BIT AS YOU

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:01.631
ASK THAT QUESTION- MY LEGAL

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.532
EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT THAT I WAS.

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.034
INVOLVED IN FERTIGATION AND AS

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.936
YOU ALL KNOW BURKE IS A EVERY

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:09.372
THE ISO IS A FOR. REGULATED

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:10.840
ENTITIES SO I THINK THAT WILL

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:13.909
BE HELPFUL. I SPENT MANY MANY

01:05:13.976 --> 01:05:15.278
YEARS LICENSING AND BUILDING

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:16.979
POWER PLANTS OF ALL KINDS

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:19.982
RENEWABLE GAS AND- ALSO WORKING

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:22.585
ON CUSTOMER DEMAND PROGRAMS.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:23.686
AND I ALSO DID A LOT OF POWER

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.187
CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS SO I

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.155
THINK I HAVE A LOT OF JUST

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.490
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THOSE

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:29.392
AREAS AS ISSUES MAY CROP UP

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:32.928
THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE A

01:05:32.995 --> 01:05:34.363
CONTRIBUTION. LATER AS THE CEO

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:35.464
WHICH I DID FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:38.668
YEARS. FROM THE PICTURE I WAS

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:39.935
RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOURCE

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.704
PLANNING WHICH IS WORK AND

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:43.072
STRATEGIC PLANNING WHICH IS

01:05:43.139 --> 01:05:44.273
WHERE YOU TAKE A LONGER VIEW

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.409
YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:46.909
SORT OF THE DAY TO DAY

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.744
MANAGEMENT ISSUES BUT ALSO

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.279
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT ARE

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:51.981
YOUR GOALS AND HOW DO YOU GET

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:53.282
THERE AND PARTICULARLY WHEN THE

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:55.484
GOALS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:56.719
MY CASE BY A PUBLICLY ELECTED

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.954
BOARD. MY JOB IS THE MANAGER

01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:00.189
THERE WAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.490
ACTUALLY GET THERE SO I'M

01:06:01.557 --> 01:06:03.726
HOPING I AM SORT OF PRACTICAL

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:07.396
EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO SET- BUT

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.597
CREATE WHAT I USED TO CALL THE

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:09.699
PUNCH LIST OF WHAT YOU NEED TO

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.334
GET DONE. THE TASKS THAT NEED

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.436
TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AND SENATE

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:14.904
METRIC SO YOU MEASURE WHETHER

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:16.038
OR NOT YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.940
ACCOMPLISHING WHAT YOU DO. AND

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:19.575
LAST BUT NOT LEAST I DID MANAGE

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.844
SMILED DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.112
SO I HAD THE PERSONAL

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:24.246
EXPERIENCE OF LIVING THROUGH

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.981
THAT WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND I

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.583
KNOW ABOUT HOW SERIOUS THE

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.352
CONSEQUENCES OF ROLLING OUTAGES

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.587
CAN BEAT TO CONSUMERS. WHO ARE

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.056
ECONOMY THAT PEOPLE DEPEND ON

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:35.958
ELECTRICITY EACH AND EVERY DAY

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:39.195
FOR EVERYTHING THEY DO AT THIS

01:06:39.261 --> 01:06:40.629
POINT. AND HOPEFULLY. I WILL

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:43.232
HAVE SOME. OF THE ABILITY TO

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.568
REFLECT THAT AS WE ENGAGE IN

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:46.936
DECISION MAKING AT THE HIGHEST

01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:50.039
SO. LAST BUT NOT LEAST- WE

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:51.107
SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS I THINK ARE

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:52.842
MORE LITIGATING MARKET POWER

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:54.510
ABUSES SO ONE OF THE THINGS

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:55.845
THAT I THINK IS A CRITICAL ROLE

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.012
THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T GET

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:58.948
TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH. AT THE I

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:01.150
SO BUT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:03.786
IS THE ISO IS YOUR TOOL. USED

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.088
THE LEGISLATURE. OR ENSURING

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.356
THAT MARKET POWER ABUSES ARE

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:09.258
NOT GOING ON AND WE HAVE AN

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:09.992
EXCELLENT STAFF AN INDEPENDENT

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:11.727
STAFF. THAT WORK ON THOSE

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.295
ISSUES DAY AND NIGHT AND SO I

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.664

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.950
FOR GOVERNOR LESLIE LET ME JUST

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:36.419
ASK YOU- ONE OF THE THINGS YOU

01:07:36.485 --> 01:07:40.122
SAID- IN OUR CONVERSATION AND I

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:42.258
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. THE

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.793
DISCUSSION HAS GONE TO CLIMATE

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.429
US FOR. IT SAID EXTREME WEATHER

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:50.232
COULD BE OUR NEW NORMAL. AND

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:51.967
GIVEN THE NEW NORMAL THAT HAS

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.769
EXTREME WEATHER WITH DRAMATIC

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:56.305
INFLUENCES ON THE GRID. HOW DO

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:58.073
YOU SEE YOUR ROLE AND SORT OF

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.608
TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THAT

01:07:59.675 --> 01:08:05.014
DEALING WITH THAT. YEAH I WISH.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.216
I WAS BEING FLAT BED I ACTUALLY

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:09.685
MANAGE I THINK THAT WE ARE

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.587
WE'RE AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.823
TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST WAS

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.591
SITTING THERE LIKE JANICE TODAY

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:17.426
WAS WE DIDN'T WE HAVEN'T

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:19.295
EXPERIENCING EXTREME WEATHER-

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.397
IT BAD IN THE ENTIRE WESTERN

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.432
GRID AT THE SAME TIME YEAH

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.800
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONCE

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.002
EVERY THIRTY YEARS RIGHT- BUT

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.672
THE TRUTH IS NOW WE HAVE TO

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.307
LOOK AT THIS EVEN WHAT WE'VE

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:33.342
SEEN SO FAR THIS YEAR AND AS

01:08:33.409 --> 01:08:36.612
YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY JULY. THAT

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.782
THIS IS NOW. THE IMPACT OF THE

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:41.150
CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE ARE

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.485
BECOMING MORE EVIDENT IN

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.420
EXTREME HEAT IN THE NORTHWEST

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:48.858
IS NOW. A REGULAR EVENT SO I

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:51.026
THINK IN TERMS OF OUR PLANNING

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:53.429
I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH SENATOR.

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.797
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE INTER

01:08:54.864 --> 01:08:57.233
AGENCY PLAN. YOU KNOW EVERY

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.334
EVERYBODY WAS SORT OF IN THE

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.902
SILOS WHEN I FIRST SHOWED UP

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:01.537
NOBODY IS IN A SILO ANYMORE

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.239
EVERYBODY TALKS TO EVERYBODY.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.974
IN FACT YOU KNOW OUR OUR NEW

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.178
CEO. ELLIE IT MEANS- NEEDS

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:11.447
PLANS REGULAR MEETINGS WITH NOT

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.582
ONLY HIS COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.885
YOU SEE AN SEC BUT ALSO THE

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:16.919
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE WESTERN

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:18.888
GRID AND OF COURSE ALL OUR

01:09:18.954 --> 01:09:20.256
STAKEHOLDERS AS PART OF OUR

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.892
YEAH YEAH. SO WE NOW HAVE A

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:24.827
VERY LARGE AUDIENCE INCLUDING

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.095
YOURSELF IN THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:27.663
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT WE

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:28.631
ARE COMMUNICATING WITH

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.399
REGULARLY AND THE BENEFIT OF

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.434
ALL THAT IS THE ENHANCE

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.870
COMMUNICATION COOPERATION. NOW

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:37.540
HAS TIGHTENED UP THE PLANET. SO

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:38.374
THAT THAT SENATORS WERE

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.242
CONCERNED. YOU KNOW INITIALLY

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:42.011
AFTER THAT THE LOAD SHEDDING

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:43.979
LAST SUMMER THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

INTO THE SUMMER RIGHT. I DON'T

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:53.022
KNOW HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD DO

01:09:53.088 --> 01:09:54.623
IN TERMS OF OUR PREPARATION AND

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.392
AS JAN WAS SAYING WE WOULD

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.160
TAKEN SEVERAL ACTIONS RECENTLY

01:09:58.227 --> 01:09:59.228
IN WHICH THE CAPACITY

FIRST THING I ALWAYS LIKE TO

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.871
SAY WHEN ASKED THIS QUESTION IS

01:13:28.937 --> 01:13:30.038
YOU KNOW THE ULTIMATE DECISION

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:32.875
RESTS WITH. YOU SENATOR AND THE

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.643

WASN'T CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:49.124
TO. TO DO THAT. THEN THEN I

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.859
WOULD SAY THAT A HORSE ARE ONLY

01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:53.128

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:04.006
BECAUSE AS WE PROCURE WE'RE

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.607
TAKING CLEAN ENERGY OUT OF THE

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.342
OTHER WESTERN STATES RIGHT

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:08.477
THERE THERE IS THE REVERSE

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:10.546
ARGUMENT ACTUALLY NOW WHAT I

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:11.647
LIKE ABOUT THIS ENTIRE

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:14.183

YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:22.024
ALIGNMENT OF WESTERN STATES

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.459
WITH YOU KNOW EVEN ARIZONA IN

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:26.795

OREGON WE HAVE WASHINGTON WE

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.732
DON'T CALL AROUND. THESE STATES

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.000
ARE ALL ADOPTING THEIR OWN

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.769
CLEAN ENERGY GOALS FOR THEIR

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:36.972
STATE SO ADDS THAT ALIGNMENT AS

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:39.374
AN ALIGNMENT THE CURSE OF

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.543
AGREEING THAT THIS IS OUR

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:44.213
FUTURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:48.584
THAT MAKES. IT MUCH MORE

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.184
APPEALING FOR IT DOESN'T. FOR

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:50.018
US TO HAVE A MORE TO CONSIDER A

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:52.154
MORE INTEGRATED GREAT NOW THE

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:54.022

OR LESS WILL HAVE TWENTY THREE

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.040
PARTNERS WILL HAVE 80% OF THE

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:14.309
WESTERN GRIT. NOW WHAT IT WHAT

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:15.878
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.279
CREATED THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.348
THE SIXTEEN WELL WHEN WE WERE

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:21.049
IN TROUBLE LAST SUMMER. WE HAD

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.751
AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN HUNDRED

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:23.785
MEGAWATTS WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:24.753
IF WE HADN'T HAD THE

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.021
RELATIONSHIP RIGHT WE WOULD'VE

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.923
IN TEXAS KIND OF BY OURSELVES

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:30.525
YEAH HEY. WE WERE HAPPY WE HAVE

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.060
A PARTNERSHIP TO GET THE

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:32.694
SIXTEEN HUNDRED EXTRA MAY

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:34.263
WHAT'S WE'RE ALSO VERY HAPPY

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:36.298
THAT IT SAVED US. OVER A

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.933
BILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW IN

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.903
COST. AND THAT WE HAD WHEN WE

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.638
WHEN WE CREATED IN A QUOTE

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.306
OVERSUPPLIED ENERGY CLEAN

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:46.241
ENERGY WE HAD A MARKET TO SELL

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:47.576
INTO RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:49.678
CURTAIL ANYMORE. SO ALL THE

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.380
EVIDENCE IN MY OPINION ABOUT

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:54.549
THIS WESTERN RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.852
THE IBM IS FAVORABLE. NOW WHEN

01:15:56.919 --> 01:15:58.487
YOU GO TO THE NEXT STEP THE EDM

01:15:58.553 --> 01:15:59.821
RIGHT BECAUSE THOUGH THE I AM

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.890
STRAINING 5% YOU KNOW IT'S A

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:03.659
REAL TIME MARKET RETREATING 5%

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.560
REAL TIME MARKET. THE NEXT

01:16:05.627 --> 01:16:06.762
THING WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.730
WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT MODELING

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.599
THE EDEA THEY HAD MARKET

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.700
BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:16:11.767 --> 01:16:13.368
ABOUT TRADING HOW 2% THE ENERGY

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:14.403
WAS SOMETHING. THAT WERE

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:16.271
MODELING THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:18.740
WE'RE SEEING THE BENEFITS. WITH

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:19.341
WITH THE PLUSES AND NEGATIVES

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:25.380
OF THAT ARE. AND AS YOU KNOW

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:26.815
SENATOR. DIFFERENT DIFFERENT.

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:29.618
STATE HOW ISSUES WITH. THEY

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:31.954
AGREE WITH THOSE A PERCENT SO

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.855
BUT I THINK THE DECISION ABOUT

01:16:33.922 --> 01:16:36.158
TRADING IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:16:36.224 --> 01:16:39.328
DECISION NOW BUT IT ONLY WORKS

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.296
IF YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR OWN YOU

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.198
KNOW YOUR OWN STANDARDS YOUR

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:46.668
OWN LOSS YOUR OWN REQUIREMENTS

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:49.004
FOR PROCUREMENT SO I THINK IT'S

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.272
ONE OF THOSE I THINK WE'RE

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:51.940
STILL WAITING AND SEEING BUT

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.508
RIGHT NOW THE EVIDENCE IS

01:16:53.575 --> 01:16:55.577
LEANING TOWARDS. THE WESTERN E.

01:16:55.644 --> 01:16:58.680
I AM HAS REALLY BEEN A GOOD

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.148
THING FOR CALIFORNIA. SURE

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:02.017
ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD TO THAT

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.118
YEAH I WAS GOING TO SAY LET ME

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:04.553
THAT WAS A GREAT ANSWER RIGHT

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:05.988
MARY BUT I'LL GO AHEAD. WITH A

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.089
LITTLE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.857
DIFFERENT WRINKLE FIRST OFF

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.359
I'LL SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.961
WHERE YOU ARE EVERYBODY WOULD

01:17:13.028 --> 01:17:13.595
LIKE TO FIND THE CHEAPEST STUFF

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:16.531
THEY CAN. NUMBER ONE.

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:18.066
CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY IS

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:20.102
DEMONSTRATING THAT. RENEWABLES

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:22.104
WORK. THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAN

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.206
MAKE LOAD. THAT THEY ARE

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:26.308
AVAILABLE THAT YOU CANNOT SIGN

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:27.976
CAPACITY VALUE TO THEM THAT

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:29.578
THEY DO OPERATE THE WAY THEY'RE

01:17:29.644 --> 01:17:32.581
EXPECTED TO OPERATE. AND DURING

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:33.982
THE PERIODS WHERE THE SUN IS

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.984
NOT SHINING OR THE WIND IS NOT

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.185
BLOWING I'M NOT BLOWING YOU CAN

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:38.854
BACK THEM UP. WITH BATTERIES

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:39.721
AND WE'RE STARTING TO

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.590
DEMONSTRATE WE'VE SHOWN A

01:17:41.656 --> 01:17:43.425
NORMA'S PROGRESS IN MY VIEW.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:44.726
AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO

01:17:44.793 --> 01:17:45.694
WITH BATTERIES AND OTHER

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.129
STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES AND THIS

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:48.964
CONCEPT OF A HYBRID SOLAR

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:51.299
PLANT. THAT BASICALLY USES

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:53.668
SOLAR ENERGY SURPLUS SOLAR

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:54.369
ENERGY TO RECHARGE ITS

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:57.606
BATTERIES. IS REMARKABLE. AND

01:17:57.672 --> 01:18:00.142
IS COST EFFECTIVE. AND IS GOING

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.276
TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.412
PEOPLE ACROSS THE WEST. I THINK

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:05.280
THAT AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.149
YOU LOOK AT COAL PLANTS AROUND

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:09.017
THE WEST THEY ARE CLOSING

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.119
BECAUSE THEY ARE ON ECONOMIC.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:12.988
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE MUCH

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:14.556
TO DO WITH. MAYBE A STATE

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:17.526
POLICY IN WYOMING ABOUT. NOT

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:19.661
RENEWABLES IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.129
THE FACT THAT IT IS NO LONGER

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:23.031
ECONOMIC FOR THOSE PLANTS TO

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.366
OPERATE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY.

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:25.233
BASICALLY AFTER WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.568
THIS YEAR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:29.004
A LOT OF VOLATILITY. IN GAS

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:32.007
PRICES AS WELL. SO FROM. FROM

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:33.875
THE VERY BIG PICTURE WE HAVE

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:35.744
MADE SUCH PROGRESS WITH THE

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.612
TECHNOLOGY AND THE COST. BUT I

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:39.781
THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE VERY

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.783
FOCUSED ON. WHAT'S THE MOST

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:42.884
EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THINGS

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:45.220
WHAT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:45.921
TO GET ELECTRICITY TO

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:47.756
CONSUMERS. THEY'RE GOING TO SEE

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.591
THAT CALIFORNIA'S PATH IS

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.593
GIVING US THE ERROR. AND

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.161
THEY'RE GOING TO BE INTERESTED

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:54.896
IN FIGURING OUT. HOW DO YOU

01:18:54.963 --> 01:18:57.165
INCREASE THAT. AND IF YOU ADD

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.067
GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF

01:18:59.134 --> 01:19:00.936
RESOURCES SO THAT YOU SPREAD.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.671
SO TO SPEAK YOUR FOOT PRINT OF

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:04.306
RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN MIX AND

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.308
MATCH. YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:07.342
WITH BETTER COST STRUCTURE FOR

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.511
EVERYBODY. SO IT SEEMS TO ME

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:13.615
THAT. THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS.

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:14.916
AND SO BORENSTEIN OUR BOARD IS

01:19:14.983 --> 01:19:15.684
PROBABLY ONE BETTER THAN THAN

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:16.918
ME THE OTHER ONE ACT. ARE

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:18.954
DRIVING US TO THE CLEAN ENERGY

01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:20.455
FUTURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.457
LEADING ON. BUT THE ROLE THE

01:19:22.524 --> 01:19:23.225

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:26.161
