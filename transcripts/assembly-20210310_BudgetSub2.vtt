VIDEO BECAUSE IT HAS. A WAY

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:57.836
THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE

WITH THE INFORMATION- OF THE

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.507
MASTER PLAN WE'VE HAD OVER

PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING WITH THE

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:10.615
INFORMATION THAT'S IN THE

00:29:10.682 --> 00:29:11.716
MASTER PLANNING WERE SEEN AS

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:13.251
HEAVILY CONSTRAINED CALIFORNIA

00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:15.186
BUT WE ALSO HAVE. PEOPLE IN

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.754
OTHER STATES OTHER COUNTRIES

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:18.123
LOOKING AT WHAT CALIFORNIA IS

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:22.160
DOING IN THIS AREA. AS CAPTURED

00:29:22.227 --> 00:29:24.462
IN THE MASTER PLAN. SO IN YOUR

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.297
AGENDA ITEM ALL IT OUTLINES THE

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:27.765
VARIOUS GOALS AND HIGHLIGHTS

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.934
AND STRATEGIES. THAT ARE KEY TO

00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:31.302
THE MASTER PLAN SO WE HAVE

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:32.704
ORGANIZED THE MASTER PLAN

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.406
AROUND FOUR KEY GOALS. ON A YOU

00:29:35.473 --> 00:29:37.876
CAN SEE THEM HERE ON THE SITE-

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.010
ONE IS HAVING PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:42.046
ARE. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:43.781
YOUNG CHILDREN THINKING ABOUT

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:45.517
HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT JUST

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:46.417
EXISTING BUT HOW THEY'RE

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:48.586
UNIFIED HOW THE STRENGTHENED

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:49.354
AND HOW THEIR SUPPORT OF

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.422
COLLECTIVELY. OF OUR CHILDREN'S

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:53.057
LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND

00:29:53.124 --> 00:29:54.192
THEN ULTIMATELY YOU COULD HAVE

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:55.493
PROGRAMS BUT WE CAN'T DELIVER

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.328
PROGRAMS WITHOUT. THE WORK

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.997
FORCE THAT'S AVAILABLE AND NEED

00:29:59.063 --> 00:30:02.133
TO SEE OUR WORKFORCE- BOTH

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.169
SUPPORTED DEVELOPED. AND

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:06.137
INCENTIVIZE ALONG THE KIND OF

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:07.572
CAREER PATHWAYS THAT WE WANT TO

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.542
SEE THAT BUILDS FOR OF QUALITY

00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:12.310
THAT BUILD FOR. WHAT WE KNOW

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:13.811
RESEARCH SIZE MATTERS TO YOUNG

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:16.347
CHILDREN- AND IS SUPPORTED THEN

00:30:16.414 --> 00:30:17.882
BY SOME COHERENCE IN THE WAY

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:19.117
THAT WE IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.718
PROGRAMMATIC WORK STANDARDS

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:23.154
WORKFORCE. OUR STANDARDS ARE

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:24.856
I'M- THE NEXT AREAS FUNDING IN

00:30:24.923 --> 00:30:26.357
THIS IS ONE THAT WE HEARD QUITE

00:30:26.424 --> 00:30:27.525
A BIT ABOUT AS WE ARE COMING

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:29.494
INTO THIS WORK. AS WE ARE

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.162
WORKING THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:32.430
THAT'S FINE WHICH IS YOU DON'T

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.032
GET VERY FAR WITH PROGRAMS THAT

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:35.400
WORK FORCE IF WE CAN'T PUT

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:39.504
TOGETHER. A LOGICAL. WAY OF

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:41.172
THINKING THROUGH HOW TO BRING

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.874
TOGETHER FINDING HOW TO THINK

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.576
ABOUT FINDING AS IT. NEEDS TO

00:30:44.642 --> 00:30:46.778
BE INCREASED AND BUILDING THAT

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:48.279
AROUND THAT THE KINDS OF THINGS

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:49.948
WE WANT TO SEE WITH THAT. THE

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:51.916
RIGHT PROGRAMS- PUTTING THEM

00:30:51.983 --> 00:30:53.785
THE RESOURCES THAT THAT'LL

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.620
ULTIMATELY BUILDS ITS

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.255
WORKFORCE- THAT WE WANT TO SEE

00:30:57.322 --> 00:30:59.657
AND THEN FINALLY OPERATIONS-

00:30:59.724 --> 00:31:00.692
THINKING ABOUT GOVERNANCE

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.060
ADMINISTRATION. HOW DO WE

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:03.695
STREAMLINED THE SYSTEM SO THAT

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:05.830
IT'S FAMILY PARENTS CENTRIC

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:09.167
CHILD FOCUSED- AND EASIER TO

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:10.635
NAVIGATE SO THAT THOSE THINGS

00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:13.137
THAT WE SAY MATTER- WITH REGARD

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.172
TO CREATING EQUITABLE

00:31:14.239 --> 00:31:16.074
OPPORTUNITIES. ARE QUITE ARE

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.743
ARE MORE APPARENT OBVIOUS AND

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:25.283
AVAILABLE. THE FAMILY SO THOSE

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.850
ARE THE FOUR BROUGH AREAS I

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.218
WILL JUST MAKE A HIGH OF EACH

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:28.553
OF THESE SO YOU KNOW GOAL ONE

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.256
B. PROGRAM. WE BEEN THERE- YOU

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:31.889
KNOW BOTH RESEARCH A RECOMMEND

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:35.727
THE- AROUND- UNIVERSAL- WE'VE

00:31:35.793 --> 00:31:37.362
LOOKED IN DEPTH AT PAID FAMILY

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:39.230
LEAVE AND WHAT IT WILL MEAN

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:41.099
THAT TAKE NUMBER CALIFORNIA'S

00:31:41.165 --> 00:31:42.267
PRESENTLY AND BUILDING THAT

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.569
SYSTEM. OUT TO BE MORE

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:46.170
INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE FROM

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:48.439
THE STATE AND THEN A KEY AREA

00:31:48.506 --> 00:31:49.574
AROUND ALCOHOL TREATMENT OF

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.342
CHILDREN WHERE WE HAVE.

00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.478
PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW- ARE

00:31:53.544 --> 00:31:54.846
PRESENT AND NEEDED TO MAKE THAT

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:56.714
MORE OF A STANDARD OF THE STATE

00:31:56.781 --> 00:31:58.082
WITH REGARD TO HOW WE SUPPORT

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.284
BILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS JOIN

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.253
WITH DISABILITIES- AND TAKING

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.455
UP ARMS. YOU KNOW ADDRESSING

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:06.624
OUR PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW. ARE

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.459
VERY BARRIERS TO US ACHIEVING

00:32:08.526 --> 00:32:10.094
EQUITY SO ELIMINATION OF

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.963
SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION-

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.364
WORKING HARD TO SUPPORT

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.799
INCLUSION AND THAT STARTS AT

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.768
THE VERY BEGINNING- WHERE WE

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:18.369
ARE FOCUSED ON INFANTILE THEIR

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:19.604
CARE AND HOW WE NEED TO MAKE

00:32:19.671 --> 00:32:20.805
SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUR

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:23.141
WORKFORCE CAPACITY. AND

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.076
PROVIDING MORE TARGETED

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:27.378
ATTENTION TO HOW WE ADDRESS

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:28.713
THAT AREA NEED FOR OUR STATE.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.082
FARM YOU KNOW WORKFORCE THIS IS

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:34.652
THE SECOND GOAL- IS SO KEY TO

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.587
THE SYSTEM WHICH IS. WE KNOW

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:38.690
THAT WE CAN ONLY PROVIDE ACCESS

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:40.024
IF WE CAN HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:42.427
THERE TO SUPPORT CHILDREN. AND

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.629
HAVING THAT DONE IN A WAY THAT

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:51.169
ALLOWS FOR THE FULL RANGE OF.

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:53.204
OF CARE GIVERS TEACHERS- THAT

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:54.472
OUR PUBLIC ASSIST AND SO ONE

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:55.440
WE'VE GOT IS THERE'S MANY. IN

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:56.674
TYPES OF PRO WHICH OFTEN

00:32:56.741 --> 00:32:58.943
SEGMENTED CITING SEPARATE ON

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.612
THE WORK FORCE AND SO ONE KEEP

00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.047
PROPOSAL THAT THE MASKED BY

00:33:03.114 --> 00:33:04.215
MAKES IS LET'S BUILD A

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.217
WORKFORCE AROUND COMPETENCIES.

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:07.585
SO THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.087
ARE WITH REGARD TO THE FUNDING

00:33:09.153 --> 00:33:11.823
THE PROGRAMS WE SEE PATHWAYS

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.158
FOR THOSE- IN ROLES AS

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:16.127
CAREGIVERS PROVIDERS TEACHERS.

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:18.830
AND IN THOSE PATHWAYS WE WANT

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:20.598
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESEARCH

00:33:20.665 --> 00:33:22.533
AROUND WHAT WE SAY MATTERS FOR

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.702
YOUNG CHILDREN. IS CONNECTED TO

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:26.237
WHAT WE THEN TRAINING AND

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:28.039
SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE WITH AND

00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:30.708
SO USING- MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:32.210
ARE CREATING THE FOUNDATIONAL

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:33.544
UNDERSTANDING AROUND CHILD

00:33:33.611 --> 00:33:34.312
DEVELOPMENT. LEARNING

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.614
ENVIRONMENTS- YOU KNOW FAMILY

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:38.583
ENGAGEMENT AND THE LIKE SO THAT

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:40.017
WE CAN ADVANCE THESE

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.919
COMPETENCIES AS PEOPLE PROGRESS

00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:43.054
BUT THAT WE HAVE THEM AS A

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.288
FOUNDATION. AND THAT THAT

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:46.290
PROGRESSION FOLLOWS A CAREER

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.626
PATHWAY THAT'S- INCENTIVIZE

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.961
SUPPORTED BY HOW WE FUND THE

00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:51.596
SYSTEM AND THAT WERE WORKING

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:53.698
TO. BETTER STREAMLINE

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:55.500
DIFFERENCES RIGHT REACHED C. OF

00:33:55.566 --> 00:33:56.934
PERCEIVED DIFFERENCES OF

00:33:57.001 --> 00:33:58.436
PROGRAMS AND MAKING THEM-

00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:00.438
CONNECTED OR SO WE CAN SUPPORT

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.240
ALIGNMENT. FOR HOW OUR

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:03.808
WORKFORCE WILL MOVE THROUGH AND

00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:07.111
ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND- KEEP

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:09.213
PEACE FUNDING SO. THIS IS ONE

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.949
THAT I KNOW- THIS COMMITTEE IS

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:14.185
BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH- YOU

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:15.920
KNOW AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT A

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:16.421
QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU

00:34:16.487 --> 00:34:19.190
STRUCTURE. SO THAT WHEN WE GET

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.425
TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE MORE

00:34:20.491 --> 00:34:21.959
FUNDS TO PUT IT WE CAN SAY THAT

00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:23.561
WERE LOGICALLY ADDRESSING IT

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:25.463
AND DINNER AND- CONNECTING TO

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.398
THE THINGS THAT WE SAY WE VALUE

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:28.433
IN THE SYSTEM SO. YOU KNOW WE

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:31.636
HAVE- ONE KEY STRATEGY AROUND

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:32.870
SLIDING SCALE FEES AND THAT IS

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.572
IF WE CAN EXPAND WHERE WE

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:35.973
PROVIDE SUBSIDIES SO THIS ISN'T

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.775
ABOUT ASKING PARENTS TO PAY

00:34:37.842 --> 00:34:39.377
MORE IT'S ABOUT FINDING WAYS

00:34:39.444 --> 00:34:41.646
WHERE. WE CAN EXTEND SUBSIDIES

00:34:41.712 --> 00:34:43.448
WE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO HAVE A

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:45.349
SLIDING SCALE SPEAK THAT THAT

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:53.658
ALLOWS FOR- SOME RAMP DOWN. AND

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:54.859
THEN WHAT THAT AND WE COME.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.761
LOOK LIKE AND THEY- IMPORTANTLY

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:57.995
THE AT WAY WE HAVE OUR REMEMBER

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:58.596
SO HAVE A RIGHT PROGRAM THEY

00:34:58.663 --> 00:34:59.831
HAVE STRUCK. WE'RE SAYING WE

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.632
CAN THOSE CAN BE UNIFIED. AND

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.835
IMPORTANT- ORGANIZED- AROUND

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:06.337
ACOSTA A MODEL OF REIMBURSEMENT

00:35:06.404 --> 00:35:07.472
SO THIS WOULD BOTH SIMPLIFIED

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.540
WITH AMPLIFIER VIEW ON EQUITY

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:11.642
AND IT WOULD BRING ME INTO THE

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:13.678
FORMULATIONS OF FOCUS ON WHAT

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:15.513
CHILDREN NEED. AND ATTENTION TO

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.415
QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT

00:35:17.482 --> 00:35:19.817
WE PROPOSED IS- HAVING A

00:35:19.884 --> 00:35:21.519
STRUCTURE THAT HAS BASE RATES

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:23.020
WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE THINGS

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:25.089
THAT WE KNOW MATTER- AND ARE

00:35:25.156 --> 00:35:26.724
CONNECTED VERY MUCH TO WHAT WE

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:27.859
CALLED OUT FOR WORKFORCE AND

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.461
PROGRAM. AND FINALLY THE LAST

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:33.397
AREAS MAKING THE SYSTEM SO THAT

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:35.733
IT IS- STREAMLINED THE FROM THE

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.401
VIEW OF FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:38.536
MAKING IT SO THEY WERE

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:40.671
ORGANIZED AROUND HOW WE- BEST

00:35:40.738 --> 00:35:43.975
SUPPORT AND USE DATA AND-

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:45.476
INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:47.178
DRIVE TO WHERE WE SEE NEEDS.

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:48.179
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:50.147
FACILITIES AND BUILDING FOR

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:51.949
SOME TYPE OF SHARING.

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:55.353
EFFICIENCY OF YOU KNOW HAVING-

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:57.288
KICKING OUT THE BUSY WORKER

00:35:57.355 --> 00:35:59.023
PAPERWORK- AND MAKING THAT

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.025
SOMETHING WE CAN STREAMLINE SO

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:02.293
THAT WE CAN ADD TO EFFICIENCY

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.895
OF OPERATION SO WE CAN FOCUS

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:06.163
MORE OF THE SYSTEM ON. THE

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:11.002
SUPPORTIVE. OF CARE GIVING AND

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:11.936
LEARNING. AND THEN I'LL THIS

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.371
CAN KERR. THIS WOULD BE YOU

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:14.405
KNOW ANOTHER MAJOR PART OF THE

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:15.640
MASTER PLAN WAS. LOOKING AT

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.074
WILL WANT WHAT WHAT A SYSTEM

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:20.511
LIKE THIS COST. INTO THAT'S

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:22.780
YOUR PLAN INCLUDES AN IN DEPTH

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.582
LOOK AT A COST MODEL FOR COST

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:26.684
MODELING FOR VARIOUS POLICY

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:29.186
SCENARIOS- FOR WHICH WE HAVE

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:30.755
ESTIMATED THAT DEPENDING ON

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.823
THOSE POLICY CHOICES. IT WOULD

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.525
COST AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:36.160
TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:37.395
TWELVE THE TEN YEARS THANK YOU

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:39.297
I'M SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:41.232
A MASTER PLAN AND THAT RANGES

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:42.967
LARGELY BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY

00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.135
IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT WE

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:46.504
NEED TO BE MADE WITH REGARD TO-

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:49.206
WHERE DO YOU. ESTABLISH VARIOUS

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:51.008
YOU KNOW METRICS ON QUALITY

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:54.645
WHAT WE MEAN BY ACCESS AND SO-

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:56.180
THAT DEBUTED THE RANGE HERE

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:57.615
THOUGH BUILDS ON WHAT IS

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:59.383
PRESENTLY ABOUT SIX BILLION

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.686
DOLLARS IN. PUBLIC INVESTMENT

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.187
AND ANOTHER SIX BILLION DOLLARS

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:04.989
IN WHAT WE SEE AS PART OF

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.325
FAMILY COST RIGHT NOW SO

00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:08.793
ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE SAYING

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:12.396
IS. AT THE TOP END OF THIS

00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:15.266
PLANT I WAS DOUBLING THE AMOUNT

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:17.735
OF TOTAL SPEND ON ON THE SYSTEM

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.070
FOR WHICH WE THINK IT NEEDS YOU

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.571
KNOW WE WOULD SEE A COMBINATION

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:21.839
OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT BUSINESS

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.442
CONTRIBUTIONS PHILANTHROPY. AND

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:26.377
SOME- POTENTIAL FAMILY FEES FOR

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:28.012
FAMILIES PARTICIPATING THAT ARE

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.246
CURRENTLY NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:37:29.313 --> 00:37:31.782
OF. THE EARLY CHILD CARE AND

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:32.817
LEARNING OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:37:32.883 --> 00:37:34.919
IN THE STATE AND ONE OF THE KEY

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.354
THINGS THAT WE THINK IS SUPER

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.723
TIMELY ABOUT THIS PLAN IS IT

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:41.759

OUTLINING WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:51.902
FOR ONLY CHILD. SO THIS REALLY

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:54.472

IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS THE

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.160
CURRENT LEGISLATION WORKS

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.062
SLATED TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.030

TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND YES IT'S

00:52:53.803 --> 00:52:55.338
REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE A PLAN

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.440
AS A ROADMAP FOR HOW WE MIGHT

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:58.575
MAKE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:01.511

HAPPENING AT THE BARGAINING

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.952
TABLE. AND WE REALLY LOOK

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.120
FORWARD TO HAVING THESE

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:11.821
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AT THE

00:53:11.888 --> 00:53:13.924
SAME TIME. THAT IN ADDITION TO

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.658
THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION

DOCUMENTS TO MAKE THOSE

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:21.698
CRITICAL DECISIONS. JANELLE DO

YOU WANT TO SPEAK MORE

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:24.801
SPECIFICALLY TO- WHETHER

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:26.369
THEY'RE TO BE IT I DON'T THINK

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:27.771
THAT THE LEGISLATION IS.

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:30.674
TERRIBLY SPECIFIC ABOUT-

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.576
INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE OF CHILD

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:37.781
CARE- BUT THAT MAY COME INTO

00:53:37.847 --> 00:53:38.348
SHARPER FOCUS IN THE COMING

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:39.816
WEEKS. YEAH I WOULD SAY I'M I'M

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:43.553

WE DON'T HAVE PROPOSALS YET

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.756
THAT WOULD SAY HERE'S WHAT'S

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:48.124
GOING INTO THE FEDERAL BUDGET

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:49.025
BECAUSE I THINK SO MUCH

00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:50.894
ATTENTION HAD TO QUIT ON THE

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:53.430

YOU KNOW BY NOW THAT THAT HAS

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:59.903
PASSED THROUGH AND HOPEFULLY.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:02.105
ABOUT WHERE TO GO AND I THINK

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:04.741
THAT- THE MASTER PLAN BECAUSE

00:54:04.808 --> 00:54:06.142
OF THAT OF MY MAKE PRESENTS A

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:08.311
VERY GOOD CASE OF THOSE THINGS

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:09.679
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAID IT

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:12.015
WHEN THEY WERE- CAMPAIGNING

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.450
REALLY ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

00:54:13.516 --> 00:54:15.151
SEE AS NEEDSAND THEN WE CAN

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:15.719
SUBSTANTIATE THAT WITH THE

00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.554
RESEARCH- THAT'S PART OF THE

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:18.888
MASTER PLAN AND THAT. THE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:21.324
DEFINITION OF ACTIVITIES THAT

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:23.793
ARE PART OF THE MASTER PLAN.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:25.929
YES SO. I THINK IT'S A GOOD

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:27.864
POINT SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.666

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.635
PACKAGE IT'S ONE TIME MONEY AND

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.236

AND SO WE'RE PUTTING MONEY ON

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.869
THE BUDGET TO HELP DISTRICTS

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:15.004

LEGISLATION THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.878
FINANCE HASN'T SPOKEN UP ABOUT-

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:24.680
ALIGNMENT IN NTK STANDARDS. IS

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.549
THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:30.920
THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSD- NOW

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:34.323
OR STORE DOWN THE ROAD. HELLO

RECOGNIZE THAT THE STANDARDS

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.762
BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROGRAMS. ARE

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:41.330
DIFFERENT THE WAY THAT OUR

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:42.965
CURRENT PROPOSALS ARE SET UP-

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.734
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:46.035
INTERACTION OF FACTS THAT WE

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.870
WOULD SEE FROM AN ONGOING

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.172
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.706
EXPANSION ARE GOING TO BE

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.208
REALIZED AT THE VERY LEAST IN

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.810
THE BUDGET YEAR. WITH THE

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.445
INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM THERE

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:58.214
IS A ONE YEAR- DATA COLLECTION

01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:00.683
PROCESS THAT WE HOPE TO GET

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.951
FROM LEDS BEFORE WE START

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.187
ANOTHER YEAR OF DOLING OUT

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:06.322
THOSE INCENTIVE GRANTS- AND

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.524
THAT PROCESS ALLOWS US. TO SEE

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:09.826
WHAT SORT OF CAPACITY BUILDING

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.160
MEASURES WILL BE TAKEN UP

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:12.595
THROUGH THESE GRANTS AND

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:15.298
DETERMINE HOW WE CAN BUILD UPON

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.466
A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:18.901
PROPOSAL SO AT THIS TIME WE

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.069
THINK THAT THESE. ARTICULAR

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.270
GRANT PROGRAMS ARE SHORT TERM

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:24.574
IN NATURE- AND- TO THE EXTENT

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.309
THAT THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.076
STATE PRESCHOOL AND

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.377
TRANSITIONAL CONTEMPORARY GRANT

WILL BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:30.980
IS CERTAINLY A CONVERSATION

THAT WE MAY LOOK AT AS A RESULT

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:41.791
OF RESEARCH FROM THE MASTER

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.593
PLAN. WILL COME TO FRUITION SO

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:44.927
WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:02:44.994 --> 01:02:46.529
THEY ARE DIFFERENT- TO THE

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.797
EXTENT THAT THEY EXPAND THEY

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.066

THAT WILL BE PUTTING FORWARD

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.842
POTENTIALLY IN THE BUDGET. AND

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:01.944
THROUGH COMPANION LEGISLATION.

THE- CHILD CARE I THINK WE HAVE

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.791
TO BEGIN BY SAYING THANK YOU TO

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:59.460
LAWS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- THEY

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:02.396

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:05.433
DURING THIS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC-

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.033
HAVE RISKED THEIR HEALTH THEIR

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.969
SAFETY. JUST TO CONTINUE

01:30:08.035 --> 01:30:10.071
SERVING OUR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES

01:30:10.138 --> 01:30:13.007
OUR CHILDREN- OFTENTIMES

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:17.011
PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK-

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.246
SOME PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO

01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:20.114
THEM AND I AGREE AS THE HEROES

01:30:20.181 --> 01:30:22.450
ARE THE SHE ROSE- DURING THIS

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:23.885
PANDEMIC AND WE HAVE TO

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:25.219
RECOGNIZE THEM AS THE ESSENTIAL

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:28.823
WORKERS. THAT THEY ARE I. SO I

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:31.859
WANT TO BEGIN WITH THAT. WHEN I

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:36.297
READ ABOUT THE- CHILD CARE

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:40.201
CENTERS THAT HAVE CLOSED. WITH

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:42.837
THOSE OF CLOSE TEMPORARILY AND

01:30:42.904 --> 01:30:44.939
THOSE THAT CLOSED PERMANENTLY

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.607
THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS OF THAT

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:47.775
OF COURSE THAT ARE OF GREAT

01:30:47.842 --> 01:30:49.710
CONCERN ONE IS THE CHILDREN

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.345
THAT ARE NOT BEING CARED FOR

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:53.147
BUT THE OTHER IS THE BUSINESS

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.683
ASPECT THESE ARE ALL BASICALLY

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.518
SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.887

BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING UNDER

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:12.800
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:15.503
EVEN MORE CONCERNED. THAN WE

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.905

01:36:28.015 --> 01:36:29.884
CERTAINLY LOOK AT A CLOSURE

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:31.719
INFORMATION IS A DIFFERENT

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:32.987

01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:22.609
THIS POINT THOSE PROGRAMS WERE

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:24.478
NOT PROPOSING TO. REINSTATE

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.480
FUNDING I GET THAT LET ME JUST

01:46:26.546 --> 01:46:27.781
RESPECTFULLY PUSHED BACK ON

01:46:27.848 --> 01:46:29.382
THIS AND WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE

01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:31.218
HERE WE BOTH WENT TO EXPAND

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:33.086
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL ACCESS

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:35.288
THROUGH T. K. BUT IN IN IN

01:46:35.355 --> 01:46:37.457
DOING THAT TWO OF THE NEEDS OUT

01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:40.327
OF THE GECKO OUR- FACILITIES

01:46:40.393 --> 01:46:41.828
AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:44.097
SO. IT SEEMS THAT THESE THINGS

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:46.133
GO HAND IN HAND AND SINCE WE

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:48.201
DON'T HAVE THE BUDGET WELLS

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:51.338
LIKE WE DID- A YEAR AGO LAST

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:53.707
LAST SPRING NOR HAVE WE HAD IN

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.408
THE FALL IT SEEMS THAT THESE

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:57.477
THAT THESE TWO ISSUES ARE RIGHT

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:59.780
FOR TAKING A LOOK AND- AND

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:02.315
REINSTITUTING THEM AS

01:47:02.382 --> 01:47:02.916
PRIORITIES IN THE STATE BUDGET

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:08.822
SO- AND THEN AS FAR. AS THE-

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:12.559
THE R. RATE INCREASES ARE ARE I

01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:13.527
GUESS WE CAN WE'LL TALK ABOUT

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:14.728
THAT FROM THE PRACTICAL LEVEL

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:18.732
FROM THE PROVIDERS- IN A SECOND

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:19.332
BUT HERE WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:21.768
FINANCE AND SO. WHAT'S YOUR

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:23.804
WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT

01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:24.337
DO YOU THINK THE HAVE ANY

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:25.972
ACTION NOW YOU SAID YOU'RE-

01:47:26.039 --> 01:47:27.340
TAKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

01:47:27.407 --> 01:47:28.608
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS CHRIS

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:31.578
PERRY SAID. BUT NOT ALL

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:33.647
INDIVIDUALS. WHO BENEFIT FROM

01:47:33.713 --> 01:47:35.482
INCREASED RATES. ARE PART OF

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:37.150
THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:38.018
PROCESS SOME GROUPS ARE PART OF

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:40.120
THAT SO- WHAT'S THE COMMITMENT

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:41.888
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO.

01:47:41.955 --> 01:47:45.458
INCREASING RATES THE ARMAR SMR.

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:46.893
SO WE CAN MAKE THESE PROGRAMS

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.695
VIABLE AND ENSURE THAT WE DON'T

01:47:48.762 --> 01:47:50.831
PAY THAT. WORKERS FAST FOOD

01:47:50.897 --> 01:47:52.399
WAGES WHO ARE TAKE CARE OF OUR

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:56.536

NOW WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:47:57.637 --> 01:47:59.606
FINANCE SO I WOULD JUST NOTE

01:47:59.673 --> 01:48:01.708
THAT ON TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

01:48:01.775 --> 01:48:02.909
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE

01:48:02.976 --> 01:48:04.244
IN THE FUTURE WE CERTAINLY

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:06.446
UNDERSTAND THAT- SUSTAINABLE

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.448
RATES AS A BENEFIT TO THE

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:11.084
FIELD- WE WILL CERTAINLY LOOK

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.619
TO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:14.955
KNOWING THAT AS WE- WORK TO

01:48:15.021 --> 01:48:16.122
TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM THERE'S

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:17.057
GOING TO BE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:48:17.123 --> 01:48:18.525
EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:20.260

THAT FRONT SO I WILL LOOK

01:48:27.601 --> 01:48:28.735
FORWARD TO A CONVERSATION ON

01:48:28.802 --> 01:48:30.437

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:31.771

ANYTHING APARTMENT OF FINANCES

01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:23.429
PERSPECTIVE THAT WHILE I'M

THERE'S A FEW THINGS GOING ON I

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:25.632
THINK WHEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:53:25.698 --> 01:53:28.334
NOTE THAT THE OVERALL ESTIMATES

01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:30.737
ARE WORKS HE SPOKE AT ARE

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:33.239
ACTUALLY TRENDING LOWER THAN WE

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.842
HAD ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED I'M

01:53:35.909 --> 01:53:38.211
NOT JUST FOR CHILD CARE BUT FOR

01:53:38.278 --> 01:53:40.146
THE CALVET RAM AS A WAR-

01:53:40.213 --> 01:53:41.714
SOMETHING THAT MAY BE DUE TO

01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.650
THE STIMULUS PAYMENTS AND THE

01:53:43.716 --> 01:53:45.552
UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS THAT HAVE

01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:47.954
STATE DOCKS AND WE NEED- BUT WE

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:49.756
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING. THAT

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:53.059
TREND- AS WELL AND SO THAT'S

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:54.594
ONE THING ANOTHER THING IS THAT

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.829
THERE ARE SOME CHANGES BETWEEN

01:53:56.896 --> 01:53:59.933
THE TRANSITION BACK WORKERS IN

01:53:59.999 --> 01:54:01.534
MACAU WORK STAGES PROGRAM AS

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:06.506
MANY OF. YOU MAY KNOW THERE ARE

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:07.140

END. STAGE EVERY SEAT CHILD AND

01:54:09.108 --> 01:54:11.945
THEN WHAT'S A OF DEEMED STABLE.

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:13.379
THEY TRANSITION TO STAGE THE

ALSO AS PART OF TODAY'S A

02:13:51.923 --> 02:13:54.393
CONSIDERATION IS RATE REFORM.

02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:56.461
REFORM IS A HUGE REQUIREMENT

02:13:56.528 --> 02:13:59.765
THAT IS NEEDED. BECAUSE WE

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:02.000

REFORM IS CRUCIAL TO ANY

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:15.580
FOUNDATIONAL CHANGES THAT ARE

02:14:15.647 --> 02:14:17.082
PROPOSED EVEN IN THE MASTER

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:19.484
PLAN OR ANY PLANLEGISLATURE

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:22.387

02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:24.523
ENSURES PROPER WAGES. IT

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:26.091
ENSURES STABILIZATION OF THE

02:14:26.158 --> 02:14:28.427
WORK FORCE IT ALSO ENCOURAGES

02:14:28.493 --> 02:14:30.796
FOLKS TO BE MAINTAINED IN THE

02:14:30.862 --> 02:14:32.063
WORK FORCE. BECAUSE WITHOUT

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:37.402
EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF

REIMBURSEMENT WE RECEIVE FOR

02:14:39.404 --> 02:14:42.441

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:44.676
COST OF MINIMUM WAGE PERSONS

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:48.113
SPECIFICALLY- IN ELEAZAR AND IF

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:48.980
FOR THOSE PRIVATE NONPROFITS

02:14:49.047 --> 02:14:50.515
WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT GIVING

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.017

WELFARE OR RETIREMENT BENEFITS

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:56.154
TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. THOSE RATE

02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:59.491
REFORMS TO HEAR IT FOR QUALITY

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:01.827
FOR OR INCENTIVIZING FOR OTHER

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:04.262
THINGS THAT WE ALL WANT TO FEEL

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:08.633
IS BEDROCK. AS PART OF REFORM

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.735
ALSO COLD. LEARNING RECEIVE

02:15:10.802 --> 02:15:12.704
SOMETHING MORE THAN A DIET COLA

02:15:12.771 --> 02:15:16.308
WE MUST RECEIVE RECIPROCAL.

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:18.210
BECAUSE OUR COSTS ARE THE SAME

02:15:18.276 --> 02:15:21.613
COST AS EVERYONE ELSE'S COSTS.

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:24.382
SO IF K. TWELVE OFFICIATING IN

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:27.118

02:15:34.993 --> 02:15:37.929
THAT K. TWELVE DOES NOT HAVE.

02:15:37.996 --> 02:15:39.631

GET A DIFFERENT ANSWER HERE-

02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:27.585
LAST YEAR WE HAD OVER TWO YEARS

02:25:27.652 --> 02:25:29.353
AGO WE FOCUSED ON INCREASING

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.155
MONEY FOR FACILITIES. AND

02:25:31.222 --> 02:25:32.557
PROFESSION OF ELEMENT LAST

02:25:32.623 --> 02:25:34.892
YEAR'S BUDGET WE TOOK THAT TOOK

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:39.263
THAT MONEY. OUT WHAT WAS THE

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:40.932
OUT COMMERCE SINCE A LOST

02:25:40.998 --> 02:25:42.800
OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE

02:25:42.867 --> 02:25:45.369
FACILITIES STOLLER'S AS WELL

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:47.839
AS- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:53.010
RESOURCES. SO LET'S START WITH

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:55.947
CDCR DOUBLE MORGAN WITH THE

02:25:56.013 --> 02:25:56.547
TASK LET'S ASK YOU TO ADDRESS

02:25:56.614 --> 02:26:01.986
THAT. THANK YOU CHAIR. I THINK

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:03.521
I HIGHLIGHTED IT BRIEFLY WE

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:04.922
ACTUALLY KNOW THERE WAS QUITE A

02:26:04.989 --> 02:26:06.290
BIT OF DEMAND FOR THE

02:26:06.357 --> 02:26:07.992
FACILITIES GRANT THAT WE WERE

02:26:08.059 --> 02:26:09.961
WORKING ON AND WE HAD GOTTEN TO

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:11.028
THE POINT WHERE WE ARE ABOUT TO

02:26:11.095 --> 02:26:13.564
RELEASE THAT. WHEN WE KNEW THAT

02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:14.332
THE FUNDS WERE GOING TO BE

02:26:14.398 --> 02:26:15.800
SCRAPPED ANY RESPECT FOR A

02:26:15.867 --> 02:26:16.400
REALLY GOOD REASON WE

02:26:16.467 --> 02:26:19.203
UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL SITUATION

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:21.372
THE STATE BUT IN LAST YEAR.

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:23.040
IT'S JUT THAT THE FISCAL STATE

02:26:23.107 --> 02:26:24.242
TURNING AROUND AND LOOKING VERY

02:26:24.308 --> 02:26:26.110
DIFFERENT CURRENTLY WE THOUGHT

02:26:26.177 --> 02:26:28.546
THAT'S A REALLY CRITICAL AREA

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:30.915
TO INVEST IN AND KNOW THAT EVEN

02:26:30.982 --> 02:26:31.782
WITH THE FUNDS THAT WERE

02:26:31.849 --> 02:26:33.684
DEDICATED TO IT THAT DEMAND WAS

02:26:33.751 --> 02:26:35.319
ANY EXCEED THAT AVAILABILITY.

02:26:35.386 --> 02:26:36.654
WOULD SAY THE SAME FOR THE

02:26:36.721 --> 02:26:38.856
WORKFORCE. PATHWAYS GRANT AND

02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.625
WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE WHAT WAS

02:26:40.691 --> 02:26:43.161
FORMALLY CALLED EACH. AND

02:26:43.227 --> 02:26:45.696
FUNDED BY CTR QUALITY FANS AND

02:26:45.763 --> 02:26:47.331
TRANSFORMED THAT SAID THAT IT

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:48.666
WAS MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE

02:26:48.733 --> 02:26:50.501
PROGRAMS GET ACCESS IT BUT IT

02:26:50.568 --> 02:26:51.269
WAS ONLY TWELVE MILLION

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:53.704
DOLLARS. AND THAT DOESN'T

02:26:53.771 --> 02:26:54.906
NEARLY MEET THE NEEDS OF WHAT

02:26:54.972 --> 02:26:57.141
THE DEMOCRATS. AND I THINK I

02:26:57.208 --> 02:27:02.813
WILL. ALSO CHEST KNOWING THAT.

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:03.948
ALL OF OUR- AND ALL OF OUR-

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:05.816
NEED ADDITIONAL. THE WORKFORCE.

02:27:05.883 --> 02:27:07.818
DIDN'T ADDRESS COME. BUT DID

02:27:07.885 --> 02:27:09.554
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES AND

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:11.822
SUPPORTS INCREASED. KNOWLEDGE

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:15.026
EXPERTISE. AND ACCESS TO BOTH

02:27:15.092 --> 02:27:16.360
HIGH QUALITY TRAINING

02:27:16.427 --> 02:27:18.062
APPRENTICESHIP MODELS. AND

02:27:18.129 --> 02:27:20.331
ACTUAL UNIT SAID THAT PROVIDERS

02:27:20.398 --> 02:27:22.066
COULD GO ON AND GET A DEGREE.

02:27:22.133 --> 02:27:23.267
AND AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE

02:27:23.334 --> 02:27:25.203
THINGS IN THE MASTER PLAN.

02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:26.771
AROUND A UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL

02:27:26.837 --> 02:27:29.106
SYSTEM ONE OF THE COMPONENTS IS

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:30.575
TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY BASED

02:27:30.641 --> 02:27:33.077
PROGRAMS. ALSO COME UP AND MEET

02:27:33.144 --> 02:27:35.446
THE SAME STANDARDS. SO FOR THE

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:36.380
FIELD TO MEET THE SAME

02:27:36.447 --> 02:27:37.481
STANDARDS WE WILL NEED TO

02:27:37.548 --> 02:27:39.750
INVEST IN THE WORK FORCE. TO

02:27:39.817 --> 02:27:41.052
PROVIDE THE SUPPORT SO THAT

02:27:41.118 --> 02:27:45.723
THEY CAN THEN MOVE THAT'S. IN

02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:46.591
NEED THOSE HIGHER STANDARDS.

02:27:46.657 --> 02:27:49.827
OKAY OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S MY

02:27:49.894 --> 02:27:51.929
FINAL QUESTION SO REMEMBER BY

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:55.066
ADONIS- I JUST HAVE ONE

02:27:55.132 --> 02:27:56.367
QUESTION HERE RATHER IT MIGHT

02:27:56.434 --> 02:27:57.435
BE MORE OF A RHETORICAL

02:27:57.501 --> 02:27:59.036
QUESTION BUT IF ANYBODY WANTS

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:02.039
TO WEIGH IN- HOW CAN SOME OF

02:28:02.106 --> 02:28:03.107
WHICH I THINK ARE REAL THESE

02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:04.542
REALLY GREAT BUDGET REQUESTS

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:07.578
AND RECOMMENDATIONS- HOW CAN

02:28:07.645 --> 02:28:09.080
THEY HELP MAKE CHILD CARE MORE

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:11.249
AFFORDABLE. FOR THE MIDDLE

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:12.316
CLASS BECAUSE WE TALK A LOT

02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:15.419
ABOUT- THE OUR MOST VULNERABLE

02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:18.256
OR LOW INCOME FAMILIES- SPECIAL

02:28:18.322 --> 02:28:19.423
NEEDS- ENGLISH LANGUAGE

02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:21.859
LEARNERS BUT WHAT I THINK WE

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:24.095
HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE DEEPLY

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:26.364
ENOUGH IS THAT THE REALITY THAT

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.466
FOR MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES

02:28:28.532 --> 02:28:30.201
THEY MADE TOO MUCH MONEY TO

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:32.503
QUALIFY FOR ANY STATE AID OR

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.438
LOCAL COUNTY AID. BUT THEY

02:28:34.505 --> 02:28:35.706
DON'T MAKE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO

02:28:35.773 --> 02:28:38.442
AFFORD YOU KNOW FIVE SIX TWELVE

02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:40.244
HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CHILD CARE

02:28:40.311 --> 02:28:43.080
OR PRESCHOOL BUT- FEES SO HOW

02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:44.582
DID THESE REQEST AND HOW ARE

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:47.184
WE FOCUSED ON HOW CAN WE FOCUS

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:48.352
ON WHAT RECOMMENDATION RENT

02:28:48.419 --> 02:28:50.421
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE. TO

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:55.393
MAKE CHILD CARE ACCESS TO CHILD

02:28:55.459 --> 02:28:55.960
CARE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR THE

02:28:56.027 --> 02:29:04.735
MIDDLE CLASS. HI THIS IS MARY-

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:07.038
WITH PEP BOYS THE ALL TAKE A

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:09.874
STAB- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN

02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:10.741
YOU'VE ASKED INCREDIBLE

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:13.277
QUESTIONS AND WE'RE EXCITED TO

02:29:13.344 --> 02:29:14.145
HAVE YOU ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS

02:29:14.211 --> 02:29:17.415
WELL- I THINK THE CHALLENGE WE

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.050
FACE IS. AND THAT'S HOW I

02:29:19.116 --> 02:29:20.785
STARTED MY PRESENTATION WHICH

02:29:20.851 --> 02:29:23.321
SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED THE SYSTEM

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:25.256
FOR FAR TOO LONG AND SO WE HAD

02:29:25.323 --> 02:29:28.726
TO MAKE CHOICES. ON WHO. YOU

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:30.461
KNOW IS QUOTE UNQUOTE DESERVING

02:29:30.528 --> 02:29:32.563
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING

02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:35.466
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IS A

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:38.002
INDICATION THAT. THEY WANT TO

02:29:38.069 --> 02:29:39.937
EXPAND ACCESS TO QUALITY

02:29:40.004 --> 02:29:41.172
AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE FOR ALL

02:29:41.238 --> 02:29:42.573
FAMILIES AND SO WE'RE WE'RE

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.709
STARTING TO SEE. MORE FEDERAL

02:29:44.775 --> 02:29:46.744
DOLLARS COME IN AS WELL AS THE

02:29:46.811 --> 02:29:50.715
POTENTIAL OF LONG TERM FUNDING

02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:52.383
TO SUPPORT CHILD CARE FOR

02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:54.518
FAMILIES WHO MAKE UP TO-

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:56.387
SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF A

02:29:56.454 --> 02:29:58.055
HUNDRED AND 50% OF ESTIMATES.

02:29:58.122 --> 02:29:59.623
AND THAT WOULD REALLY CAPTURE A

02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:01.692
LOT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:02.293
FAMILIES THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:05.062
ABOUT. BUT UNTIL WE GOT THOSE

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:06.764
FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN UNTIL WE

02:30:06.831 --> 02:30:10.534
GET THE REAL STATE INVESTMENTS.

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:12.703
TO BOND THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:15.072
TO HAVE TO MAKE SPACES AND AT

02:30:15.139 --> 02:30:16.607
LEAST WITH OUR FAMILY FEE

02:30:16.674 --> 02:30:19.710
PROPOSAL- THAT IS ABOUT MAKING

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:21.245
CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:24.482
FAMILIES. AND EVENTUALLY FOR

02:30:24.548 --> 02:30:26.217
FAMILIES WHO STAY ON LONGER AT

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:29.053
THE HIGHER AND- WE WOULD NOT.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.521
WE WOULD ASK FOR NOTE THAT THEY

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:33.190
WOULD NOT CHARGE MORE THAN 7%

02:30:33.257 --> 02:30:34.892
OF THEIR INCOME. AND THAT'S HOW

02:30:34.959 --> 02:30:36.293
YOU KEEP IT AFFORDABLE FOR ALL

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:38.462
FAMILIES AND SO. AS WE GET THIS

02:30:38.529 --> 02:30:39.864
MOMENTUM BACK FROM THE FEDERAL

02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:41.732
LEVEL WILL BE ABLE TO REACH

02:30:41.799 --> 02:30:42.700
MORE FAMILIES KEEP IT

RECONSIDER CONTINUING WITH THE

02:55:57.513 --> 02:55:58.581
TRANSITION PLAN AND HAVE

02:55:58.648 --> 02:56:00.883
SEVERAL OPTIONS. THE FIRST

02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:01.684
OPTION IS TO STOP THE

02:56:01.751 --> 02:56:03.452
TRANSITION THE LEGISLATURE

02:56:03.519 --> 02:56:04.687
COULD DECIDE TRANSITIONING

02:56:04.754 --> 02:56:06.822
CHILDCARE AND CFCF FEATURED YES

02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:09.292
THAT. IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY

02:56:09.358 --> 02:56:10.693
AND THIS WOULD FREE UP THIRTEEN

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:12.295
MILLION AN ONGOING GENERAL AND

02:56:12.361 --> 02:56:13.462
RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S

02:56:13.529 --> 02:56:14.830
BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE

LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE

02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:19.735
SECOND OPTION IS FOR THE

02:56:19.802 --> 02:56:21.671
LEGISLATURE- IT COULD DELAY THE

02:56:21.737 --> 02:56:23.039
TRANSITION SO THIS WOULD ALLOW

02:56:23.105 --> 02:56:24.507
THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ITS

02:56:24.573 --> 02:56:25.775
ENTIRE INTENTION ON THE

02:56:25.841 --> 02:56:27.944
PANDEMIC RESPONSE. AND PLAN FOR

THE TRANSITION ON A SLOWER TIME

02:56:29.545 --> 02:56:31.514
LINE. WE CAN DELAY THE

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:32.782
TRANSITION UNTIL YEAR AFTER THE

02:56:32.848 --> 02:56:34.183

DECLARATION HAS ENDED WOULD BE

02:56:35.952 --> 02:56:38.087
A REASONABLE APPROACH. THE

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:39.355
THIRD OPTION IS TO MODIFY THE

02:56:39.422 --> 02:56:40.990
SCOPE OF TRANSITION. THE

02:56:41.057 --> 02:56:42.458
LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE THE

02:56:42.525 --> 02:56:44.827
NUMBER OF PROGRAMS. YES ASK IF

THE LEGISLATURE TAKES THIS

02:56:46.128 --> 02:56:47.463
APPROACH WE RECOMMEND KEEPING

02:56:47.530 --> 02:56:50.700
CA CFP ACCEDE GIVEN THE COSTS

02:56:50.766 --> 02:56:52.034
ASSOCIATED WITH SHIFTING THIS

02:56:52.101 --> 02:56:54.003
PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. AND THE

02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:55.071
LEGISLATURE COULD FURTHER

02:56:55.137 --> 02:56:56.205
MINIMIZE THE SCOPE OF THE

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:57.473
TRANSITION BY ALSO SHIFTING

02:56:57.540 --> 02:57:00.009
