THEM RIGHT I KNOW YOU SAY THAT

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:29.254

WORKLOAD IN WAYS AS WE KNOW

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.692
WE'RE JUST PASSING MORE THINGS

THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:44.536
THAT QUESTION THE I. THIS THE

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:46.438
LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:48.106
LANGUAGE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:49.841

00:26:49.908 --> 00:26:52.510
PC. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:26:52.577 --> 00:26:53.912
IT MADE SENSE THAT THEY HAD THE

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:55.380
CAPABILITY THEY ARE ALREADY

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.115
REVIEWING LICENSEES ON A

REGULAR TEN TEN YEAR CYCLE

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:01.553
BASIS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT- THE

DATA THAT THEY'RE BEING GIVEN

00:27:03.054 --> 00:27:05.190
IS REALLY INSUFFICIENT FOR THEM

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:08.893
TO BE ABLE TO- TAKE THE ACTION

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.596
TO DENY A LICENSE. BUT THE

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:15.800
FRANCHISE LICENSE- IT IS THIS

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:18.036
LIKELY TO GIVE THE MORE WORK I

00:27:18.103 --> 00:27:19.170
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.205
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:21.539
ASKING FOR MORE DATA WHICH

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:22.974
MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.576
HAVE TO BE REVIEWING MORE DATA-

00:27:24.642 --> 00:27:27.078

COMMUNICATION. YOU CAN MAKE A

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:42.627
COMPLAINT BUT THERE'S NO BASIS

00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:43.862
UPON WHICH THEY CAN ASK FOR

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:47.332
MORE INFORMATION OR- OR DENY A

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:48.833

FEDERALLY PREEMPTED LIKE THE

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:40.819
NOW SUGGESTS THAT I HAVE SHOWS

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:41.319
THAT THIS CONFLICTS WITH

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:45.023

FEDERAL PREEMPTION- AND- WE

00:28:56.334 --> 00:29:00.205
THIS ACTUALLY IS VERY SIMILAR

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:01.639
TO LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:03.942

SHE CAN ACCESS INTERNET ALMOST

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:12.750
ANYWHERE. IN NEW YORK STATE

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:16.354
THEY EVEN SET UP A STRUCTURE

00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:20.125
FOR THEIR- THEIR ENTITY- TO-

00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:21.659
ASK FOR THE SAME KIND OF

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.528

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:24.963
I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:32.370
TO THE TOES OF THE OF THE

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:33.938
FEDERAL PREEMPTION ON THIS WHAT

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:35.440
WE'RE ASKING FOR IS DATA WE'RE

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:38.309
NOT TELLING THEM WORK WE'RE NOT

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.410

00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:43.615
CHARGE- WHERE THERE'S A THERE'S

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:45.183
A WHOLE SERIES OF THINGS THAT

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.885
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PREAMPS

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:47.819
AND WE'RE NOT DOING ANY OF

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.455
THAT. WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:54.492

SERVICE AND WHO DOES NOT GET

00:30:00.532 --> 00:30:02.534
SERVICE SO THAT WE CAN

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.769
DETERMINE WHETHER REDLINING IS

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:06.037
GOING ON AND WHETHER

ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY IT'S NOT

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:18.149
ECONOMICALLY- ED ADVANTAGEOUS

COMMUNITIES IT DIDN'T RECEIVE

YOU MISTER CHAIR- I ALSO LIKE

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.641
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:43.111
SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEASURE NOW I

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:45.547
KNOW THAT- THE COVER NINETEEN

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:47.048
THE PANDEMIC AS YOU KNOW SURELY

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.783
HIGHLIGHTED THE DEFICIENCIES

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:51.386
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA.

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.288
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THE

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:55.190
DIGITAL DIVIDE AS A PANDEMIC

01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:57.292
WITHIN A PANDEMIC AND I KNOW

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.060
MAY SEEM INSENSITIVE TO THINK

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.062
ABOUT IT IN THOSE TERMS BUT

01:25:01.129 --> 01:25:02.831
IT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S NOT NEARLY

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:03.631
ALL IT'S NOT NEW TO OUR

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.700
COMMUNITIES IT IS SOMETHING

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.902
THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:10.672
FOR A LONG TIME. AS A TEACHER

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:11.506
FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I CAN SAY

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:15.343
WITH CERTAINTY THAT THIS IS

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.178
REALLY AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:20.215
TACKLE NOW- I THINK THAT THE

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:22.851
ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY SIX SINGLE

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:25.220
HANDILY CAN DECIDE THE FUTURE

01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.155
OF OUR STUDENTS OF OUR KIDS

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:28.690
THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:30.692
COMPETE IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY

01:25:30.758 --> 01:25:32.660
LET ALONE GLOBAL ECONOMY SO I

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:34.229
THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE GET

01:25:34.295 --> 01:25:36.698
AGGRESSIVE. AND FIGURE OUT THE

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:38.333
SOLUTION AND AGAIN I WANNA

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:39.501
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.802

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:44.806
THE WORLD AND YET WE CAN

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.641
PROVIDE THE VERY BASIC IN NEED

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.810
AND THAT'S BECOME A BASIC MEAT

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:50.745
JUST LIKE FOOD AND WATER. AND

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.280

TEN YEARS. BUT I WILL I WILL

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.342

ACCESS THE FUNDS AND USE THEM.

01:26:59.113 --> 01:26:59.647

END OF THE DAY. I'M STILL IN

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.221
THE SAME PLACE IN MY

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.591
COMMUNITIES WITHOUT SERVICE.

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:11.125
AND WITH THE PANDEMIC WE SOUGHT

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:13.161
EVEN TAKE THAT EXACERBATED WISH

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:14.762
WE COULD HAVE WE SPENT HUNDREDS

01:27:14.829 --> 01:27:17.065

CHANGED. THE OUTCOME AND SO

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:24.172

TO GET TO THOSE COMMUNITIES

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.275

OUT THERE THERE'S 97% OF THE-

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.080

DON'T GET THOSE SERVICES OVER

01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:38.553
COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY LIVE IN

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.923
ONE. IT'S HORRIBLE IT IS NOT

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.224
RIGHT AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.258
THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:44.892
ANYTHING I THINK IT'S GOING TO

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:45.460
PUT A LOT OF MONEY IN THE

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:47.595
SYSTEM. BUT I'LL BE SURPRISED.

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:50.164

NOTE THREE ISSUES- FOR THE

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.788
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THE

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:37.857
FIRST HAS TO DO WITH PRIORITY

01:56:37.924 --> 01:56:40.259
BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS ASKS THE

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:42.762
QUESTION WHAT IS THE PRIORITY

01:56:42.829 --> 01:56:44.964
AND WE SUGGEST THAT THE

01:56:45.031 --> 01:56:48.000
PRIORITY ON WATER AFFORDABILITY

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:49.635
SHOULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:56:49.702 --> 01:56:52.472

NINETEEN PANDEMIC EMERGENCY.

01:57:08.121 --> 01:57:11.090
THAT'S THE FIRST POINT SECOND

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:13.493
ISSUE- NOW FOCUSED ON THE BILL

01:57:13.559 --> 01:57:15.895
ITSELF HAS TO DO WITH THE SCOPE

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:19.665
OF SB TWO TO TWO AND WE AGREE

01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:21.834
WITH SENATOR DODD THAT THERE

01:57:21.901 --> 01:57:23.569
COULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE AND

01:57:23.636 --> 01:57:26.305
EFFICIENT WATER LOW INCOME RATE

01:57:26.372 --> 01:57:29.075
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR LIRE FOR

01:57:29.142 --> 01:57:33.112
SHORT. IT IS DRAFTED SB TWO TWO

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:34.414
TWO GOES BEYOND A LEE OR

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:37.216
PROGRAMS WITH THE INCLUSION OF

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:39.685
OTHER PROPOSALS AND A SHORT

01:57:39.752 --> 01:57:41.487
SOMETIMES IS- VERY HORT

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:43.689
PREFERENCES BUT IN ON PAGE

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:45.958
THREE PAGE FIVE PAGE PAGE SIX

01:57:46.025 --> 01:57:50.096
THERE'S DIFFERENT. REFERENCES

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:51.130
TO OTHER PROPOSALS. AND WE SEE

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:53.833
THAT CREATING A LEANER PROGRAM

01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.601
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO

01:57:55.668 --> 01:57:57.770
A LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE

01:57:57.837 --> 01:57:59.238
PROGRAM FOR WATER AND

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:02.175
WASTEWATER. THAT ALONE IS A BIG

01:58:02.241 --> 01:58:05.511
LIST AND THE SCOPE OF THE BILL

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:07.046
SHOULD BE NARROWED TO THAT.

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:08.514
THAT'S OUR OUR SECOND COMMENT

01:58:08.581 --> 01:58:11.417
TODAY AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:14.787
HAS TO DO WITH A GREAT DATA AND

01:58:14.854 --> 01:58:16.222
THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:18.825
WRITTEN IT PROPOSES TO HAVE THE

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:21.594
STATE COLLECT TO RATE AND

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:24.697
BOUNDARY DATA FROM EACH OF THE

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:27.300
THOUSANDS OF PUBLIC WATER

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:30.369
SYSTEMS. WE ASK YOU WHY IS IT

01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:33.005
PROPOSING TO DO THAT AND THE

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:34.607
SPONSORS TOLD US THAT THE

01:58:34.674 --> 01:58:36.509
PROPOSAL IS FAIR FOR

01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:38.344
DETERMINING HOW MUCH OF THE

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:41.447
BENEFIT HOUSEHOLD WOULD RECEIVE

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:43.783
FROM THE PROGRAM. AND WE THINK

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:45.918
THAT SORTING RATE DATA FROM

01:58:45.985 --> 01:58:49.188
EACH OF THOUSANDS OF SYSTEMS IS

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:52.525
UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED WAY

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.894
TO DEVELOP WHAT THE BENEFIT IS

01:58:54.961 --> 01:58:56.295
FOR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE PROGRAM.

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:58.464
SO WE SUGGEST DELETING THAT

01:58:58.531 --> 01:59:02.902
PART OF THE BILL IT'S AT PAGE.

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:03.503
EIGHT NINE NINE TO ELEVEN AND

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:05.304
TAKING A SIMPLE APPROACH AND

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.740
SETTING THE BENEFIT AND THAT

01:59:07.807 --> 01:59:10.776
WOULD AVOID UNNECESSARY FUND

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:13.179
ADMINISTRATION COSTS SO THAT

01:59:13.246 --> 01:59:16.782
MORE OF THE FUNDING. CAN GO TO

01:59:16.849 --> 01:59:17.750
HELP LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:20.219

MY COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA- FOR.

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:25.289
AFTER PUTTING THIS BILL I THINK

02:34:25.356 --> 02:34:27.324
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY-

02:34:27.391 --> 02:34:29.059
AND THE APPROACHES OUTLINED AS

02:34:29.126 --> 02:34:30.294
FAR AS EMPHASIZING ARREARS

02:34:30.361 --> 02:34:32.129
MANAGEMENT SOUNDS REASONABLE TO

02:34:32.196 --> 02:34:33.163
ME I'M I DON'T PRETEND TO BE AN

02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:34.665
EXPERT IN THIS AREA AND I DO

02:34:34.732 --> 02:34:36.867
DEFERRED TO THE EXPERTISE. OF

02:34:36.934 --> 02:34:38.569

WATER DELIVERY SINCE HE'S

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:41.905
ACTUALLY DONE IT- BUT I DO HAVE

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:42.840
SOME CONCERNS I JUST WANTED TO

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:45.442
EXPRESS HI JUST OVER A YEAR AGO

02:34:45.509 --> 02:34:46.110
OF COURSE SENATE. GOVERNOR KNEW

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:48.379
SOME- SIGNED HIS EXECUTIVE

02:34:48.445 --> 02:34:50.014
ORDER ESTABLISHING A MORATORIUM

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:52.082
ON WATER SHUTOFFS AND- I THINK

02:34:52.149 --> 02:34:53.183
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT

02:34:53.250 --> 02:34:54.118
THING TO DO IS WE HAD AN ECHO

02:34:54.184 --> 02:34:55.986
OF IN. WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT

02:34:56.053 --> 02:34:57.921
AND WE NEED TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S

02:34:57.988 --> 02:34:59.757
ACCESS TO THAT. I GUESS MY

02:34:59.823 --> 02:35:01.659
CONCERN IS WHETHER WE'RE

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:03.093
ADEQUATELY CONSIDERING THE

02:35:03.160 --> 02:35:04.828
SOLVENCY FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:07.331
WATER DISTRICTS- AS WE HEAD

02:35:07.398 --> 02:35:09.199
INTO THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES-

02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:10.801
I MET WITH A NUMBER OF-

02:35:10.868 --> 02:35:12.836
CONSTITUENTS- RELATED THE WATER

02:35:12.903 --> 02:35:14.271
INDUSTRY WATER DELIVERY EARLIER

02:35:14.338 --> 02:35:16.006
THIS WEEK IN. ODD EARLIER DAY

02:35:16.073 --> 02:35:16.807
MET WITH MY LOCAL WATER

02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:18.609
DISTRICT- THERE CARRYING A BAD

02:35:18.676 --> 02:35:19.843
DEBT RIGHT NOW ABOUT THREE

02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:21.478
POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

02:35:21.545 --> 02:35:22.613
DURING NORMAL TIMES THAT'S

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:24.214
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:35:24.281 --> 02:35:24.882
DOLLARS SO THIS IS AN INCREASE

02:35:24.948 --> 02:35:28.385
OF. ABOUT ALMOST 2000% OVER

02:35:28.452 --> 02:35:29.920
THEIR NORMAL BAD DEBT LOAD AND

02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:34.892
I ASSUME THIS IS A MICROCOSM.

02:35:34.958 --> 02:35:35.526
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE

02:35:35.592 --> 02:35:36.427
