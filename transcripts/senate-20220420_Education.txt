THE PARTICIPANT TOLL FREE NUMBER AND ACCESS CODE IS POSTED ON OUR COMMITTEE WEBSITE AND I WILL ANNOUNCE IT NOW TODAY'S PARTICIPANT NUMBER IS. IS SEVEN THREE SIX TWO EIGHT THREE THREE. I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THIS HEARING HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY IN ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DISRUPTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED WE ARE HOLDING OUR COMMITTEE HEARINGS HERE IN THE- STREET BUILDING OUT. OF THE COMMITTEE TO BE PRESS I'M TWENTY ONE HUNDRED SO WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND BEGINNER HERE. ARE WE CLEARLY DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM BUT WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAVE TEN BILLS ON TODAY'S AGENDA NONE ARE ON CONSENT BEFORE WE HEAR OF WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO FIRST OFF AUTHOR CENTER PORTANTINO WITH. FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE SB EIGHT THIRTY PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- TODAY I'M HONORED TO PRESENT SB EIGHT THIRTY. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY ENROLLMENT INSTEAD OF AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING ENSURES EQUITY IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED AND ALSO MAKES IT EASIER FOR DISTRICTS TO PLAN THEIR BUDGETS AND OPERATIONS. CALIFORNIA'S CALCULATED SCHOOL FUNDING USING THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE METHOD FOR MORE THAN FIVE DECADES AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS ALWAYS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN ENROLLMENT BECAUSE STUDENTS MAY BE ABSENT WHETHER EXCUSED OR UNEXCUSED BESIDES CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY BESIDES CALIFORNIA THE ONLY OTHER STATES THAT USED TO TENANTS BASED FUNDING METHODS ARE IDAHO. KENTUCKY MISSISSIPPI MISSOURI IN TEXAS MOST STATES BASE SCHOOL FUNDING ON THE AVERAGE DAILY ENROLLMENT A RAVAGER MOMENT REFERRED TO AS AVERAGE DAILY MEMBERSHIP WHICH IS A MUCH MORE EQUITABLE AND STABLE BASED FUNDING METHOD IN FACT. VOTING FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY FINANCIALLY PENALIZING THOSE SCHOOLS REPORT TENANTS AND IT'S NOT JUST THE SCHOOLS BUT REALLY DIDN'T SHARE IN ATTENDANCE. THAT ARE AFFECTED. SAM IN THESE COMMUNITIES FAR MORE LIKELY TO LACK RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION OR HOUSING OR SUFFER FROM HEALTH RELATED ISSUES FRANKLY MANY OF WHICH WERE EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. THEREFORE ATTENDANCE BASED FUNDING PUNISHES STUDENTS IN THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES TENANTS BASED FUNDING ALSO CAUSES ISSUES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SINCE IT'S THEIR PLAN. FOR OPERATION BASED ON THE NUMBER OF A ROLL STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO ATTENDANCE BASICALLY IT COSTS THE SAME TO TURN THE LIGHTS OUT IN A CLASS OR WHETHER YOU HAVE TWENTY KIDS IN THE CLASS OR EIGHTEEN KIDS IN THE CLASS AND SO. BY USING A TENANTS WERE PENALIZING THOSE DISTRICTS STUDENT ABSENCES ACTUALLY COST SCHOOLS MONEY BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO TRACK DOWN ABSENT STUDENTS AND PREPARE. A MAKE UP ASSIGNMENTS SB EIGHT THIRTY ATTEMPTS TO FIX THESE ISSUES BY ALLOWING ELEAZAR TO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING USING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR FUNDING BASED ON ATTENDANCE UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WHICH THEY WOULD RECEIVE BASED ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT THIS SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WILL PROVIDE ALL ELEAZAR WITH MORE FUNDING THAN THEY ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING ESPECIALLY THOSE IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT TEND TO HAVE HIGHER RATES OF ABSENTEEISM. NO SCHOOL RECEIVE LESS FUNDING UNDER THIS BILL THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT NO SCHOOL NOT BE WINNERS AND LOSERS THERE WILL ONLY BE WINNERS. IN FACT A RECENT REPORT BY THE POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION- CALIFORNIA EDUCATION ALSO KNOWN AS PACE FOUND SWITCHING FROM ATTENDANCE TO ENROLLMENT. COULD HELP DISTRICTS ACHIEVE FISCAL STABILITY REDISTRIBUTE RESOURCES. THE SCHOOLS WITH GREATER STUDENT NEEDS AND PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY ON HOW TO SERVE STUDENTS INSTRUCTIONAL ADDITIONALLY SB EIGHT THIRTY INCENTIVIZE ATTENDANCE BECAUSE AT LEAST 30% OF THE NEW FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED AND DEDICATED TO PREVENTING ABSENTEEISM. BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT THAT IMPROVE STUDENT ATTENDANCE ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSE OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND EVENTUAL TRUANCY THAT'S IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WE WANT THERE TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY WE WANT THERE TO BE EFFORTS MADE BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE SURE KIDS ARE IN CLASS AND SO BY HAVING 30% OF THIS NEW ADDITIONAL MONEY BE DEDICATED TO THOSE SOURCES. WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THE PANDEMIC HAS DEMONSTRATED HOW VOLATILE IT COULD BE A FUN POP. THE TENANTS AND- WILL ENSURE THAT. SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED EQUITABLY AND HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY SB EIGHT THIRTY COUNTS. WITH STRONG SUPPORT FROM ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THOSE REPRESENTING STUDENTS FAMILY CIVIC BUSINESS AND EMPLOYER GROUPS.

THIS IS A BILL THAT- STANDS TO ADDRESS LONGSTANDING INEQUITIES IN THE EXISTING EDUCATION SYSTEM SPECIFIC FUNDING WHILE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MORALLY AND LEGALLY REQUIRED TO TALK ABOUT RE RE ENGAGE STUDENTS WHO ARE CHRONICALLY ABSENT OR INDIVIDUALLY TORRENT SCHOOLS IS NOT CURRENTLY WE SEE FUNDING IF STUDENTS DO NOT SHOW UP. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME FOR DISTRICT HOURS A DISTRICT AND SEEN THE RAVAGES OF COKE NINETEEN WITH EXCESSIVELY HIGH QUARANTINES INDIVIDUAL.

MORE LINED THE VAST MAJORITY OF DISTRICTS STATES A THE- IS A REAL YEARS. HAS COME. THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT DOES NOT TAKE ANY MONEY FROM ANYONE. IT ACTUALLY ADEQUATELY COMPENSATES THOSE DISTRICTS WITH AN ACTUAL ACTUAL ACTUAL AND ACCURATE RECOGNITION OF ENROLLMENT RATHER THAN THE VARIATION. OF AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. SO IS BOTH WITH PRIDE- AND MEANING. THAT I SUPPORT CENTER PORTANTINO'S- EFFORTS IN BRINGING EQUITY. TO THE FUNDING PROCESS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATIE HARD ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. PTA DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION AND WE- BELIEVE YOU'RE MOVING FROM AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE TO ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING MODEL- IS A SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGE. THAT COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND OUR LETTER THEREMIN ANY POLICY CONSIDERATIONS WHEN MOVING TO A NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW OF THOSE. FIRST THE BILL IS THE WAY THE BILL IS STRUCTURE DOES NOT FIT WITHIN THE L. C. F. F. AND THAT STATE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. IF THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO CREATE A MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING SYSTEM THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND THOSE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HOLISTICALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE L. C. F. F. AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. SECOND SB EIGHT THIRTY DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION BUT REALLOCATE EXISTING RESOURCES WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. IN FACT IF ATTENDANCE IS NOT ADEQUATELY INCENTIVISED THIS CHANGE COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OVERALL EDUCATION FUNDING BECAUSE PROP NINETY EIGHT REQUIRES THE USE OF EIGHTY EIGHT FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING. THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND FINALLY THE BILL CREATES THIS ATMOSPHERE WINNERS AND LOSERS LOSERS- CTA SUPPORTS FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THE L. C. F. F. TO PROVIDE A MORE EQUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS- WE APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL- BUT WE AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED IT. FURTHER STUDY THE END OF ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING AND OTHER OPTIONS FOR PROVIDING MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT MENTAL MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE QUEUE UP. OF MS. BOTCHES WITH CALLASPO. GOOD AFTERNOON. HELLO IS THERE A BUTTON FOR THE- HELLO IT WOULD ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS IN OPPOSITION OF FTA THIRTY WE DO RECOGNIZE THE SENATOR PORTANTINO AND HIS SPONSORS ARE INTERESTED IN RESOLVING THE DISCREPANCIES THAT CAN BE CREATED DUE TO THE FUNDING BEING BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT AND WE ONLY A HAPPENED. THAT EVERY STUDENT REGARDLESS OF THEIR ATTENDANCE RECORD HAPPEN EDUCATOR CLASSROOM SPACE INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT TO ATTEND SCHOOLS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE SUCH A RESOLUTION HOWEVER SB EIGHT THIRTY AND NOT IN A ROMAN FEE SYSTEM IT IS A NEW CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS CREATED USING A NEW- ALLOCATION FUNDING. FORMULA JOHN FORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO OPPOSE SB EIGHT THIRTY AS IT DOES NOT PROVIDE THINK PARKING INSURING THAT THE FUNDS ARE TARGETED TO THE ISSUE IT CLAIMS TO BE FOCUSED ON CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND TRUANCY AND FAILS TO DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS IN AN APPLE ON THE MATTER WITHOUT IT YOU CAN ABILITY AND OVERSTRETCHED SURE. THE BILL WHICH ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO LEDS WITH LOWER. ATTENDANCE RATES. WITHOUT ANY OR COUNTY ALL OF THE- NOW IS THIS YOUR REVIEW PRIOR TO DISTURB OF TO DO. IF THE L. E. WITH HIGH AFTER. HAVE PRIORITIZED AND IMPROVE THE KIND ABSENTEE AND TRUANCY RATE PRIOR TO THE FACT THAT CO THAT. THE BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE A NEW FUNDING SOURCES OUTSIDE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH WILL COMPLICATE HOW LEDS REPORT ALL OF THEIR AVAILABLE RESOURCES. IN THERE- CAPS TO ADDRESS EACH STATEWIDE PRIORITY. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE SPONSORS ALLOCATION DATA RUN THEREFORE WE CANNOT PLAN IN THIS YOUNG THAT THE FUNDS WILL BE THERE TO. BE PART OF OUR OVERALL FUNDING SYSTEM NOT ALL AND LIAISE WITH PRIORITIZE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AS THEIR PRIMARY ISSUE TO ADDRESS. AGAIN ANOTHER LOST OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT ALLEVIATES HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO MEET THEIR STUDENTS NEEDS. F. EIGHT THIRTY. REWARD LEN HAVE NOW FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING CRIME OFTEN. ISSUES DOES NOT HI THE FUNDS TO CORRECT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS AND DOES NOT FACE BASED. ON AN APP EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE. THANK YOU ARE YOU WILL COME BACK HERE TO ROOM TWENTY ONE HUNDRED IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WISHES TO OPPOSE SB THIRTY IN THE ROOM PLEASE COME FORWARD SEEING NO ONE MET A MODERATOR WE'RE GOING BACK TO YOU IF YOU CAN PLEASE QUEUE UP ANYONE. ON THE LINES WHO WISHES TO OPPOSE SB EIGHT THIRTY. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB EIGHT THIRTY PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE NOW. AND I HAVE NO ONE IN Q. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR ALRIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SEEING AND HEARING YES GO AHEAD SUTTER CORTESE. THIS COMMENTS MANAGER OF. EIGHT WE'RE I DO VERY MUCH RESPECT- YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOUR POINT OF VIEW. AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND I HAVE BEEN PRETTY STEADFAST IN THAT REGARD. OF FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN ON THE COMEDIAN EXPECT TO BE. SO IN THE FUTURE SO NO KNOWLEDGE THAT- THE AMENDMENTS DON'T DO ENOUGH FOR ME AND I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN NOT THAT I'M ANY MORE OR- LESS AN EXPERT THAN ANYBODY ELSE BUT- IF I CAN JUST SPEND A MINUTE ON. OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE- GOING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- AT THAT TIME- JUST PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE A DELAY EASTON WAS STOLEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER IN CHARTER SCHOOLS HAD NOT BEEN CREATED YET SO. I'M AGING MYSELF BUT THERE'S A POINT IN THE AGING MYSELF IN THAT IS THAT- A FEW YEARS AFTER THAT. I STARTED BRINGING PEOPLE APPEAR IN BUSLOADS TO SACRAMENTO TO ARGUE FOR. A RESOLUTION TO I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES REFERRED TO AS A DISPARITY PETE BETWEEN- BUT WROTE RELATIVE O TWO EIGHTY AB SCHOOLS- THERE HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN EIGHTEEN OF THOSE BUS TRIPS UP HERE. AND OVER AND OVER OVER OVER AGAIN ESPECIALLY IN TIMES WHEN WE DID NOT HAVE RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN THE BUDGET LIKE WE DO THIS YEAR. OF THE RESPONSE WHICH WAS DISAPPOINTING BUT SOMETIMES COMPELLING WAS SAID. WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY RIGHT NOW AS A STATE- TO RESOLVE THAT PROBLEM GIVEN THE SCALE- I FEEL THAT. THE ULTIMATE REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS BILL FROM A- OVERALL FISCAL IMPACT TO EDUCATION IT EVEN TO THE STATE BUDGET- ARE COMPLETELY CERTAIN AT THIS POINT- BUT I JUST CAN'T AFTER ALL THESE YEARS- IT IN MY OPINION PUT LET THE PERFECT GET IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD. I FEEL LIKE. THIS MAY BE MY ONE SHOT AS SENATOR AFTER ALL THESE YEARS- IT. TO DO SOMETHING BOLD YOU KNOW TO ATTEMPT TO REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT HERE REALIZING FULL WELL THAT JUSTICE MIGHT NEED TO BE MADE IN THE FUTURE- IF THIS DOES GET SIGNED INTO LAW. SO AGAIN RESPECTFULLY- IN IN RESPECT WITH OPPOSITION- IN IN IN CAN RESPECTFULLY TWIRLING CHAIR I JUST I JUST WANTED TO- TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR WHAT THIS IS ABOUT FOR ME AND YOU KNOW WHY FROM HONESTLY FROM THE DAY ONE WHEN I SAW THE BILL IN PRINT- FILTER A COMPELLING NEED TO SUPPORT IT. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE CENTER GLAZER. AS CHAIR- THIS IS A- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BILLS THAT I THINK THAT I HAVE FACED IN MY TIME ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND I KNOW- IN APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR FOR- DIGGING DOWN INTO THE SPACE AND- SALON COMFORTABLE BECAUSE- CONSEQUENCES THERE. ARE BIG ON IT AS- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN JOSE AREA. HAS SAID THAT THE PERFECT SHOULDN'T BE GOOD TO THE PERFECT SHOULD NOT GET IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD. AND I THINK THAT- ARE THERE STILL SOME QUESTIONS HERE OF COURSE THERE ARE AND- SOME. ANXIETY ABOUT THIS CHANGE IN UNDERSTANDING ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF COURSE. THERE ARE- HI- BUT I WOULD SAY THIS THAT- IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT MOVING FORWARD TODAY. THAT THIS COMMITTEE- HAS THE ABILITY TO COULD TO LOOK MORE DEEPLY IN THIS AREA HAVE MORE HEARINGS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE- DON'T DO ENOUGH AROUND HERE IS SLOW THINGS DOWN AND HAVE THAT FURTHER STUDY. NOW I THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN THIS YEAR. I DON'T THINK IT MEANS THAT WE STOP. A BILL THAT I THINK IS IT IN GOOD ENOUGH SHAPE FOR MOVING FOR BUT I THINK THAT WE CAN. HAVE MORE HEARINGS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. TO UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE MORE DEEPLY THANK AND THAT AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF THERE ARE ANY MORE DEEPLY WE CAN STILL DO THAT. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND THAT WOULD. MY CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTION IN REGARD TO SOME OF THE ANGST ABOUT THIS CHANGE. I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SEND A NOTE TO ALL MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS MORE THAN A DOZEN IN MY DISTRICT ON THIS BILL. AND GOT FEEDBACK FROM ABOUT TEN. THAT I'VE REVIEWED AGAIN YESTERDAY. AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY FEEL THAT THAT THIS IS GOING TO SERVE THEM WHILE. A FEW SAID THAT NOT SO SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET ANY BENEFIT OUT OF IT BUT THEY DIDN'T SEE THE NEGATIVE- MOST OF THEM FELT THIS. POSITIVE STEP FORWARD IN THAT WAS COMPELLING TESTIMONY TO MAKE. THEIR LIVES FOR THE BILL TODAY WOULD BE HAPPY TO MOVE IT. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER. GOOD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I HAD A COUPLE COMMENTS. UP I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO DO A BILL ON ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING. BUT AFTER WE DUG IN A LITTLE FURTHER- I DID SEE SOME ISSUES THAT I THOUGHT WERE PROBLEMATIC. AND I AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT. OF MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING FOR OUR SCHOOLS. PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA- I'VE NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE ISSUES. OF THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED TO WIN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS FIRST ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN JUST BEFORE I WAS ELECTED. HOW WE COUNT STUDENTS HOW WE FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION. SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION C. T. E. AND MORE. AND THIS BILL FURTHERS THOSE DISCUSSIONS. HOWEVER AS IT RELATES TO FIVE. STUDENTS ROMAN SAID A PENDANT. BELIEVE IT. WITH CAREFUL EXAM ALL OF THIS. AND LONG TERM FISCAL. PROGRAMMATIC ADMINISTRATIVE IMPACTS. TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. AND STUDENTS. SUCH AS ARE WE AWARE OF WHAT THE IMPACT OF NOBLE. AND DEVISING STUDENT ATTENDANCE. OF ALL CHIEF. WITH THIS BILL. WINNERS AND LOSERS I KNOW THE AUTHOR IT WOULD. I DON'T KNOW THAT I FEEL THAT WAY. ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES THAT INCREASED EQUITY WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING ENGAGEMENT WOULD BUILDING UPON THE EQUITY PROMISE ALREADY BUILT INTO THE L. C. F. F. B. R. HIGHER SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION CAMPS. ACHIEVE THE SAME GOAL. THE RECENT REPORT BY THE POLICY ANALYSIS FOR CALIFORNIA EDUCATION PACE. OBSERVES THAT CHANGING THE LCF STUDENT COUNT METHODOLOGY CREATES TRADE OFFS AND SHOULD BE ANALYZED AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES FOR INCREASING FUNDING EQUITY. SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO DON'T THINK ABOUT IS IF WE GO TO ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING AND ROMANS ARE DECREASING SO MY WORRY ALSO IS THAT THIS IS A SHORT TERM FIX. THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDES THAT CHANGING THE LCF STUDENT COUNT METHODOLOGY WOULD REQUIRE. THE STATE TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO DRIVE POSITIVE PRACTICE. PRACTICES RELATED TO STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT. I DO NOT SEE A MEANINGFUL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THOSE PRACTICES IN THIS BILL. I ALSO DO NOT SEE HOW THIS BILL FITS WITHIN THE BROADER EDUCATION FUNDING LANDSCAPE. GIVEN THAT ATTENDANCE WAS STILL BE USED TO CALCULATE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING LOTTERY ALL ACTIONS AND MORE. FOR ALL THESE REASONS THE COMMITTEE REMEMBRANCE WHAT ESTABLISH. A PRE IMPLEMENTATION STUDY TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO WE CAN CONTINUE WITH THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION. WILL BE VOTING NO ON THE BILL. THE BILL HAS HOWEVER BEEN MOVED CENTER PORTANTINO. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE FOLKS WHO SPOKE. FOR THE BILL. OF CERTAIN CHANGE IS HARD. WHENEVER YOU LOOK AND CONTEMPLATE MAKING A CHANGE AND IN THIS CASE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR FIVE DECADES- IT'S A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION- THIS IS NOT A NEW CONVERSATION THOUGH- MY DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR PASADENA UNIFIED. HAS BEEN ME ASKING ME TO LOOK AT THIS CHANGE FOR A DECADE- AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SURPLUS TO THE SIZE OF THE STATE IS. A GRAPPLING WITH THIS YEAR I BELIEVE OUR STUDENTS OUR CHILDREN SHOULD SHARE IN THAT BENEFIT THAT SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY AND- ARE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT- THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA FUNDING OR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO K. TWELVE EDUCATION WILL RESULT FROM THIS BILL- AND EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT. WOULD SEE A BENEFIT- AND SO THIS IS THE TIME TO MAKE THAT STRUCTURAL CHANGE I THINK. MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COMMENTS OF HIS FRUSTRATION THROUGHOUT THE YEARS YOU KNOW GRAPPLING WITH. TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION BRINGING PEOPLE HERE HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED THIS IS THE TIME TO MAKE THAT TO MAKE THAT TRUCKS WILL CHANGE. THE SHIFT TO A MORE EQUITABLE WAY OF FUNDING EDUCATION WE KNOW THIS IS WORKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT MOST PROGRESSIVE STATE OF FUND EDUCATION BASED ON ENROLLMENT WE KNOW THAT IT DOES NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACT ATTENDANCE- WE HAVE. WE HAVE ALL OF THE PILOT PROGRAMS WE NEED BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE STATES THAT ARE DOING THIS EFFECTIVELY AND SELF. MY CLOSES THIS TIME TO EMBRACE CHANGE OBVIOUS I'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS- MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING NOT. JUST REALLOCATING PROP NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO KEEP MAKING SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I BOUGHT. AND HOPE THIS CONTINUES TO MOVE THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR USER META CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE S. B. FOR THE MOTION TO PASS THE FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LEYVA NO LEAVE NO GO ABOVE. PROTEST. BY GLAZER GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PANTS WILLIE THAT BILL- CALL FOR ABSENT ARE YOU MISTER YOU ALSO HAVE SB NINE OH SIX BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP NINE OH SIX ON RECONSIDERATION WITH AMENDMENTS THAT ARE REMOVED THE DISCLOSURE COMPONENT OF THE BILL- THERE FOR THE BILL WILL NO LONGER REQUIRE PARENTS TO DISCLOSE WHETHER ANY FARMS ARE LOCATED IN THEIR HOME I WOULD NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ABOUT 80% OF THAT INFORMATION ALREADY AND SO THAT IS AVAILABLE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT PEACE. HAS COME OUT OF THE BILL INSTEAD S. B. NINE OH SIX REQUIRES LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO INCLUDE INFORMATION ON THE SALE OF FIREARMS ON THE SAFE FIREARM STORAGE IN THEIR ANNUAL NOTIFICATION IT ALSO WILL INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WARINESS OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO HELP KEEP CHILDREN SAFE AND IT WILL ALLOW CONCERNED TEACHERS OR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TO ACT ON A PERCIFORM THREAT BY ALERTING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE SAW IN MICHIGAN WHEN IT'S DISTRICT RECEIVED INFORMATION OF A CREDIBLE THREAT AND THEY DID NOT AND- WE SAW THAT WE LOVE. PRIORITIZING THE SAFETY OF STUDENTS. AND TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND STAFF- IS IMPORTANT AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS AT HOME KNOW WHAT THE STORAGE LAWS ARE ABOUT IS ALSO IMPORTANT- SO TODAY.

AND ALSO BE ABLE TO KNOW. OFTENTIMES A HORRIBLE EVENT IS CAUSED BY THE ACCESS. AND IF A PERSON IS ABLE TO GAIN ACCESS TO A FIREARM THAT THEY ARE ANOTHER OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET BUT- BY NATURE JUST FINE. IN THE HOME. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW US TO SEE. THAT SOME THREATS SHOULD BE AND OUGHT TO BE TAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUSLY PERHAPS AND OTHERS- WE DO.

THE REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING THE THREATS MUST FOCUS ON ACTUAL THREATS NOT KINDS OF EXPRESSIONS THAT ARE TYPICAL OFYOUNG PEOPLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH DIFFICULT EMOTIONS YOU HAVE NO INTENT WHATSOEVER TO HARMONY. OTHERWISE WE KNOW WHO WILL SUFFER MOST MOST BY BEING SEEN AS A THREAT WHEN THEY ARE NOT- AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS STUDENTS OF COLOR AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. SECOND WE BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS NEED TO RETAIN DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT IS THE RIGHT RESPONSE AND THE BEST WAY TO PUT FILE ON. FOUR FOR A PARTICULAR INCIDENT. WE HOPE THE SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO NEED HELP EARLIER BEFORE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE RISK OF VIOLENCE. AND WHEN APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS WILL WORK BETTER. AND ANY POSSIBLE VIOLENCE IN A LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION WHAT. WE SO MUCH APPRECIATE SENATOR PORTANTINO'S EFFORTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THEY NEED. THOSE RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL TO PREVENTING VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND SCHOOLS SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO USE THOSE TOOLS WHEN APPROPRIATE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT STILL FOCUSES ON TRUE THREATS AND GIVE SCHOOLS WITH QUESTIONS THEY NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR IT WILL COME TO TWENTY ONE HUNDRED ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE STEP FORWARD. SEEING NO ONE MATAMATA WRITER GOING BACK TO YOU FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO QUEUE UP IN OPPOSITION OF SB NINE OH SIX. AND IF YOU'RE IN OPPOSITION OF SB NINE OH SIX. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND FIRST WE HAVE LINE. HUMPTY REMOVED HIMSELF ONE MOMENT FOR THE NEXT NINE. AT FIRST WE HAVE LINE ONE SIXTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD.

AND NOW WE HAVE LINE ONE THIRTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD- MANAGER MEMBERS SAMPLE REDDISH REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA AND ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL RIFLES ASSOCIATION WE CONTINUE TO BE IN OPPOSITION TO SB NINE OH SIX. AND NOW WE HAVE LINE ONE FORTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME'S ROOMY AND I'M STRONGER. OF THE FIELD AT FIFTY NINE OH SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. BILL DEFENDER CORTESE. IF SOMEONE- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN IN THE COMMITTEE. THE LAST TIME IT WAS HEARD HERE AND IT IT DOES CHANGE MY PLEASURE TOWARD THE BILL I- I JUST GOT FINISHED ON THE PER BILL SAYING I DON'T WANT TO LET THE PERFECT AT THE WAY THE GOOD SO- I'M GONNA STICK WITH THAT. ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME. ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED ON HERE AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION THEM AS I MEAN I GET ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. TO THE AUTHOR WITH THIS REGARD IN THIS REGARD BUT BY WAY OF EXAMPLE- EVEN THOUGH- THERE'S- DOES SOME. DEFINITION AROUND- DEPICTIONS OF WORK THOSE KINDS OF EXPRESSIONS OF NEEDING TO BE HOMICIDAL IN NATURE. OF IN APPRECIATE THE ROTC CAR ABOUT I THINK THERE'S- GONNA BE OTHER CARVE OUTS THAT. BORDER CLARITY AROUND THAT THEY NEED TO BE- DEALT WITH NOT ONLY FROM ULTIMATELY FROM THE FIRST AMENDMENT STANDPOINT BUT- AS WE ALL- ARTISTIC DEPICTIONS- WITH THE BY STUDENTS YOUTH ADULTS OR WHATEVER- ONE CAN ONLY IMAGINE AND- THEN SOME OF THE- MORE RURAL COUNTIES KIDS. GETTING EXCITED ABOUT HUNTING SEASON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN. BEING ASKED TO DEPICT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO AN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION BY ADJUSTING SOME WORK IS GOING TO NEED TO BE DONE THERE SO WE DON'T- HAVE SOMEBODY FEEL LIKE IT'S A MANDATED REPORTER- WHEN IT'S SIMPLY. AN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION FOR EXAMPLE- INSTANCE SECONDLY I'D I DON'T. YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY LIKE THE IDEA OF- IS SENSUALLY. TURNING IT PERCEIVED THREAT INTO A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN KOREAN IN A SEARCH OF YOU KNOW IN WORST CASE EVERY BACKPACK IN THE SCHOOL- JUST FROM THE STANDPOINT OF TRAUMATIZING STUDENTS AND SO FORTH BUT- I DO KNOW IN MY OWN COUNTY AGAIN NOT THE HEART CONTINUALLY HARKING BACK ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE BUT- IT. BEFORE COLUMBINE- IN FACT TWO DAYS AFTER COLIN COLE BY NOT KNOWING THAT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN WE RAN THE PURSE OF CODE RED DRILLS THERE WITH A NATIONAL AUDIENCE IN. CERTAINLY I'VE ALWAYS FELT THERE FOR THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF WHO COMPLETE ADJUSTING TO IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT- YOU KNOW EACH ISSUES AROUND CIVILLIBERTIES SADDAM EVEN THOUGH EIGHT I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT YOU CALL OUT HERE- WOULD BE STANDARD PRACTICE IN A IN A LOT OF THE COUNTIES OF. A JUST NOT SO SURE. THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY'S DOING IN ALL THE COUNTIES AND THERE CAN BE AN ARGUMENT FOR THE BILL THE NEW CAN ALSO BE AN ARGUMENT- THAT THAT THE BILL NEEDS TO BE AS- AS FALSE AS POSSIBLE IN THAT REGARD SO. SO WITH THAT I'M AN AYE VOTE- THIS TIME AROUND IN THE- THAT HOPEFULLY YOU. YOU KNOW IF YOU WERE ALE TO DO THIS MUCH WORK- IT JUST A FEW DAYS OF HOPING THAT WOULD HAVE REMAINING WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE- THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME. TO RAISE THOSE ISSUES- FOR BEFORE THE BILL COMES BACK THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE CENTER GLAZER. I SPOKE PREVIOUSLY WHEN THE BILL WAS AND- AND AT. DIFFERENT FORM THAT I THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE. I SAW MAKE MY COMMENTS BRIEF- YOU CAN'T. HEAR A BULLET HAS BEEN FIRED OUT OF A GUN YOU CAN'T GO PUT IT BACK IN. AND I THINK THAT WHAT I WOULD RATHER ERR ON THE SIDE OF GOING A LITTLE FURTHER AND FINDING WAYS TO- TO BRING IT BACK IF THAT WAS NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE BUT THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS TO STOP THESE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS FROM HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. PUT THE BULLET BACK IN THE GUN AND I APPRECIATE CENTER PORTANTINO'S YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE SPACE IT'S AGAIN NOT AN EASY THING TO LEGISLATORS- BUT YOUR HEART AND YOUR HEAD IN THIS LEGISLATION IS TOTALLY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HAVE BEEN APPROVED BUILT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER PORTANTINO WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK- KRISTEN'S COMMENTS AND MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ARE ARE RIGHT ON. YEAH YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU PREVENT SOMETHING YOU JUST KNOW YOU DO- AND- AFTER THERE'S A TRAGEDY YOU NEVER WANT TO SAY. I WISH WE WOULD HAVE DONE MORE- AND THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO WIN POWER SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN. TO MAKE. THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT SAFE I MEAN. OUR CHILDREN SPEND A BIG PORTION OF THEIR LIVES THEIR TEACHERS AND- ADMINISTRATORS AND STAFF SPEND A BIG PORTION OF THEIR LIVES ON THESE CAMPUSES- AND THEY SHOULD GO TO WORKING. FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME HOME YOU KNOW NO GRANDPARENTS. SHOULD HAVE TO READ IN THE PAPER ABOUT. THEIR BRANDLER GRANDSON BEING SHOT ON A CAMPUS BECAUSE- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT DIDN'T INVESTIGATE- WHEN THEY KNEW THERE WAS A CREDIBLE THREAT. AND WE SEEN THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM PEOPLE OFTEN SAY WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. WE SAW IN MICHIGAN THAT THERE WAS AN INACTION- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT A PRINCIPAL MIGHT SAY THAT WON'T HAPPEN HERE. OUR WATER FOR WRONG- LET'S BE CAREFUL IT'S YOU KNOW THIS. ERROR IS ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION- AND WHATEVER YOU ARE ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION THERE'S GOING TO BE CONCERNS AND SO. WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO ADDRESS THEM- AND WE THINK WE'VE GOT A LONG WAY AND THEN WE THINK THIS WILL MAKE OUR CAMPUSES SAFER FOR. FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO SPEND THEIR TIME ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND SO RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO I WILL HAVE TO AGREE WITH CENTER CORTESE- WE DO NOT WANTTO LET. PERFECT GET IN THE WAY OF THE GOOD I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK YOU DID ON THIS BILL I THINK THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE BUT FOR ME IT IS SUPPORTABLE TODAY.

AND BECAUSE- THERE ARE CARBON EMISSIONS AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF SMITH'S WE'RE NOT TALKING JUST THEIR POWER ON THE- THE POWERING OF THE MANUFACTURING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL EMISSIONS IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE USE OF LIMESTONE AND SUCH. THAT ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE THIS IS THROUGH A CARBON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION. SO WHAT SB NINE OH FIVE DOES IS ALLOWS CALIFORNIA KIDS CAST CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY IN THE UNDERGROUND STORAGE OF CARBON BY PILOTING CARBON CAPTURE FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF CAL A CEMENT FACILITIES.

GAS EMISSIONS. 101% SUPPORT CENTER SCANNERS- RECOGNITION THE TEETH US TECHNOLOGIES HAVE TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION THE FACT IS WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DEPLOYMENT OF CCS TECHNOLOGIES. THAT'S SCIENCE AND THAT'S MATTHEW OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT- FALL CEMENT IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY A NUMBER OF OTHER SOURCES AND ECONOMIC SECTORS THAT WILL. BENEFIT FROM APPLICATION OF CCS TECHNOLOGIES- COLLECTIVELY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UPWARDS OF SIXTY MILLION TONS A YEAR WHICH IS A HUGE CHUNK OF WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ACHIEVE ITS CARBON GOALS.

WELL- APPRECIATING THAT THE BROAD LANGUAGE IN THERE AS TO- YOU KNOW HOW THAT MIGHT WORK IN THAT. YES FOLKS BEING INVOLVED WITH IT I WOULD- IT JUST JUMPING OUT AT ME BASED ON SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE- SO FAR WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN WITH- THE COMMITTEE THAT I CHAIR TRYING TO COME UP WITH METRICS IN TRYING TO COME UP WITH. ANYONE WHO'S ALGORITHM CAN REALLY PULL DATA TOGETHER EVEN JUST ON THE WORK FORCE TRANSITION TO THE BONE- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IT'S SORT COLLUDED HERE IS SAID- YOU KNOW THE ONE UC CAMPUS- THAT MAY BE A PARTNER WITH OTHER CAMPUSES- IT MAY QUITE A SENSE WOULD BE TO SEE SAN DIEGO WITH SUPERCOMPUTER CENTER BECAUSE- I JUST DON'T THINK THAT KIND OF WORK IS CAPABLE OF BEING DONE. THE END OF. DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TO PRESCRIPTIVE BE IN A IN A- BUT MAY BE WORTH AT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE CENTER GLAZER. THANK YOU- I WILL NOW WITH SOME IRONY THAT THIS IS NOT THE TYPICAL ISSUE THAT WE WOULD DEAL WITH YOUR EDUCATION THROUGH- AND SO THIS OULD NOT BE CONVERSATION I WOULD TYPICALLY BE A PART OF AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE IT WITH. YOU CENTER SKINNER ON THIS BILL- I KNOW WE HAVE THE SAME SHARED GOALS- GHG GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE PLAYED A SERIOUS PROBLEM- THE- FOSSIL FUELS ARE A PART OF THAT. PACKAGE CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY TO THAT PROBLEM- AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE- DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AHEAD TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY. BEYOND THE BROADER GOALS THAT WE HAVE SET AS A STATE IN WHICH I HAVE SUPPORTED. ON THE CHALLENGE THAT I'M HAVING- IN THIS BUDGET BILL INTO GRANTED BY THE WAY YOU KNOW YOUR FOCUS ON CEMENT GOT IT GOOD REASONS. A LOT OF GOOD CAN COME OUT OF THAT WORK THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING TO DO IN THE BILL- THE- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AM. STRUGGLING WITH IN REGARD TO THE BILL IS THE NARROWNESS OF IT- JUST FOCUSING ON THAT. SPACE THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT AT THAT TO EXCLUDE TO KIND OF REVIEW AND RESEARCH. ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND HOW THAT COULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION- THERE'S A RECOGNITION. OF THE AT LEAST IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE PREVENTING PROBLEMS THAT- THAT WE SEE. IN THE ANY KIND OF APPLICATION. WITH DELAYS OF FIVE. TO BE ABLE TO. TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CARBON CAPTURE AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT HAS- I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN I LOOK AT. THE CRITERIA THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP IN THE BILL. IT IT REMINDS ME OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS SAY WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE AND THEN WE CREATE ALL THESE CRITERIA AND ALL THESE GOOD VALUES THAT WE HAVE. THAT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE FOR US TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THEN AT THE END OF THE DAY GOOD PLUS GOOD PLUS GOOD EQUALS BAD WE DIDN'T REALLY GET THE PROBLEM. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF CARBON CAPTURE AND THE POTENTIAL THE POTENTIAL THAT IT AS I SEE THE START OF THAT IN IN THIS BILL. THERE'S PARK MENSEN PRIORITIES THAT ARE SET THAT HAVE GOOD VALUES AND REASONS FOR THEM BUT THE END OF THE DAY ARE THE GONNA LET US THIS PROBLEM. THE SOLVE. AND THE WAY IN BECAUSE WE KEEP PILING ON A THE GOOD THAT WE WANT SEE AND HOW IT'S DONE IN THEN WE DON'T REALLY SUB. AND SO THOSE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE BEING WITH THE BILL THAT I KNOW COMES A GOOD PLACE THE NARROWNESS OF IT AND- HIS IS. PART OF IT THAT. HAS ME CONCERNED. ONE DIRECTION THE CARE YES OF COURSE I'M. I WAS IN STE SENATE HE Q. THIS MORNING WE HEARD AND PASSED THE BILL BY SENATOR CAFIERO ON MUCH BROADER- EMPOWERING A. R. B. SIX TO DO A MUCH BETTER. I PURCHASE A OF CARBON SURE IN STORAGE. HELLO THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY IN EUROPE NOT GOING BACK MISS CARD CABALLERO SPILL CENTER CAREER SPELL IT DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ANY PILOTS. AND THERE IS. FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY VIABLE COMMERCIAL CARBON CAPTURE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. FIND ONLY WORLDWIDE IN A FEW PLACES. SO PERSONALLY I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE I WANT TO SEE IT. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT THERE WE TAKE THE GEO SEQUESTRATION WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE ONLY SO CANYON WAS IN EFFECT- A- GEOLOGIC CAP- PLEASE HOLD. BUT CERTAIN GASES RATE IN THE ESCAPED AND IT CAUSED PROBLEMS NOW CARBON ESCAPING WOULD NOT BECAUSE THAT TYPE OF- PERCEIVE NEW AIR POLLUTION BECAUSE CARBON ME YES IT'S BAD FOR THE CLIMATE BUT IT'S NOT TOXIC PER SE BUT THE- BEING IS THAT. WE BOTH DO NOT HAVE THE GROUP WILL. YOU KNOW PUT IT'S NOT ALREADY COMMERCIALLY VIABLE WE HAVEN'T HAD. SO THE PURPOSE OF MY BILL IS TO GET US TO START THAT. IN ITS NARROW. TO YOU KNOW HAVE HOPEFULLY A SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN THEN BUILD ON. WHILE THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPING WORLD MARKETS DEVELOPING BEYOND WHILE CONFIRMING THAT SENATOR COPIERS ALSO DEVELOPS RULES OR- OR PRIORITIES FOR MUCH LARGER. SO I UNDERSTAND THE- OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE MY BILL DO EVERYTHING BUT A SINGLE BILL CAN'T DO EVERYTHING AND IT IS GETTING US AT LEAST GETTING CALIFORNIA THE EXPERIENCE OF CAPTURING SOME CARBON AND STORING IT WHICH WE DON'T HAVE YET SO THAT POINT OF VIEW I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD MOVE FORWARD IMPORTANT MOVE FORWARD. AND IT ALLOWS US THEN TO HELP US WAY SOME OF THE FEARS ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE I'M OPTIMISTIC WILL PROVE THAT IT WORKED IT DIDN'T HURT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO STORAGE GEOLOGICALLY. GO AHEAD CENTER GLAZER WHAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION AND I DID WATCH THE HEARING THIS MORNING. ON THE COPIER OF BILL AND I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU AND OTHERS ARE INVOLVED IN A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE- COM. BROADER AND FACE- AND I THINK THAT HELPS ME TODAY BECAUSE IT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WHO IS HERE IN ISOLATION I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT GOING FORWARD BUT I THINK GIVEN THE CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT- I WOULD JUST ONLY CAUTION ALL OF US SAY TO ALL OF US THAT. THAT IF WE SAY THIS IS A BIG PRIORITY CLIMATE CHANGE WELL THEN SOMETIMES WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GIVE UP SOME OF THOSE GREATER VALUES THAT WE ALSO HAVE IN OUR SYSTEMS FOR HOW WE DO OUR WORK BECAUSE WE NEED IT RESPOND TO THE CRISIS AND THAT MEANS THAT EVERYBODY GETS THEY WANT BECAUSE WE'RE RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS AND IF WE'RE GONNA SAY WE'RE IN A CRISIS LET'S ACT LIKE WORK BASIS THAT OF YOUR WORK HERE. THIS IS THE POOR. OF THAT CAN HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO DO THAT GIVING UP BECAUSE WILL PROVE THAT IT WORKS AND IT'S SAFE. INDEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH ALL RIGHT ANYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE A MOTION FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE CENTER'S GONNA MAYBE TAKE THAT MEASURE CLOSE YES EXCELLENT VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CORTESE MENTAL CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB NINE ZERO FIVE THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED THAT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA HI. LEYVA HI- TELEVOTE. WHICH WILL KNOW CORTES. AYE COURTESY AYE DALLI. DALLY NO GLAZER. LATER AYE MCGUIRE PAN WILL KEEP THAT BILL ON CALL THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS FILE ITEM FOR SENATOR DORADO SB ELEVEN SIXTY. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THAT GREAT DAY TODAY YES WE THE PASSED MY BILL. THE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU MEMBERS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE STAFF FOR WORKING ON THIS BILL- AND WITHOUT YOUR TIME YOUR STAFF'S TIME WE WOULDN'T GET THIS FAR- AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED OUTLINED ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS THANK YOU SENATE BILL ELEVEN SIXTY. WILL ALLOW DEPENDENT VISA STUDENTS THAT MEET EXISTING- ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO PAY IN STATE TUITION. AT CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. OVER TWO DECADES AGO AB FIVE FORTY WAS SIGNED INTO LAW AND ALLOWED ANY STUDENT WHO MET- ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS TO PAY IN STATE TUITION TO ATTEND OUR STATE COLLEGE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WHILE THE PASSAGE OF AB FIVE FORTY HAS PROVIDED GREATER COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR MANY STUDENTS. THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH QUOTE UNQUOTE NON IMMIGRANT VISAS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO BENEFIT FROM THE NONRESIDENT TUITION WAIVER EVEN IF THEY MEET THE REST OF THE CRITERIA. THIS BILL WILL INCLUDE DEPENDENT VISA STUDENTS WHO ARE CHILDREN OF LONG TERM VISA HOLDERS. CHILDREN WHO GROW UP WITH LEGAL STATUS IN THE U. S. BUT WILL AGE OUT AT AGE TWENTY ONE ONE THIRD DEPENDENT VISA EXPIRES. AND THEY BECOME UNDOCUMENTED. THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS HAVE GROWN UP IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE ATTENDED THE MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF THEIR PRIMARY EDUCATION IN THE STATE HOWEVER. WHEN THE STUDENTS APPLY TO COLLEGE THEY MUST APPLY AS AN OUT OF STATE RESIDENTS AND PAY INTERNATIONAL FEES AND TUITION SIMPLY DUE TO THAT PARTICULAR IMMIGRANT STATUS. IN ADDITION STUDENTS ON DEPENDENT VISAS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL OR STATE FINANCIAL AID SCHOLARSHIPS OR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS AND DO NOT HAVE WORK AUTHORIZATION TO EARN MONEY ALL WHILE THE PARENTS HAVE PAID CALIFORNIA TAXES FOR DECADES ABOUT YEARS AND DECADES. ANOTHER ISSUE IS THIS. THESE SOUT AND CHANGES THEIR STATUS OF. OF MOST UNIVERSITIES CHANGE THEIR RESIDENCY STATUS AND MAKES THEM START PAYING INTERNATIONAL TUITION RATE STUDENTS REAL GROWN UP IN CALIFORNIAN WOULD OTHERWISE MAKE RESIDENT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS ALREADY THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT NAVIGATING THIS IMMIGRATION LAW ALL SEEN AN INCREASE IN SUBURBAN DURING THE MIDDLE OF THEIR COLLEGE YEARS SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES INCREASE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY FOR A FEW MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRANT STATUS. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IMMIGRATION ISSUES FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE AND WHEN WE SAY THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN IT IS BROKEN PERIOD I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN GET THROUGH LIFE AND NOT KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS IS TREATED UNFAIRLY BY THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. HERE'S ONE SLICE THAT I HOPE THAT WE CAN CORRECT SO WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES- EVEN SEEN HER. THE CAT OF FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE OF IMPROVE THE DREAM SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND SOK SHEAVES OF BARLEY A MEMBER OF IMPROVE THE DREAM AND THE STUDENT AT SON WHO SENT STATE UNIVERSITY CENTER COURTESY.

AND I HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU THANK YOU METAMODEL WRITER ALRIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. SEEING NONE CENTER GLAZER YOUR WORK IN THE ROOM WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING YOU HAVE A QUESTION. I'M ASKING. THANK YOU CHAIR LEYVA I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AN ELEMENT OF THE BILL THAT WAS UNCLEAR TO ME- IN THE TESTIMONY FIRST OF ALL I'VE BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE DREAM ACT AND- PROVIDING THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR. THAT THAT CLASSIFICATION WHICH WE HAVE ENACTED AND IT'S A WONDERFUL ONE WHAT WHERE I'M STRUGGLING WITH ON THIS BILL IS THAT DICK THAT TESTIMONY HAS BEEN ABOUT LONG TERM. AS IDENTS GROWN UP HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S CERTAINLY THE WONDERFUL SPEAKERS THAT WE HEARD A FEW MINUTES AGO VERY ARTICULATE- ABOUT THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCE AND HOW LONG THEY HAVE BEEN HERE. BUT I I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE BILL. THE ELIGIBILITY ELEMENTS IN REGARD TO TIME SPENT IN THE STATE. I CERTAINLY AGREE THAT- SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN HERE A LONG TIME UNDEFINED. FAMILY PAYING TAXES THAT THAT THIS IS A- A PATHWAY WE SHOULD PROVIDE EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IS NOT ANYTHING I'M SURE THE AUTHOR ONCE OR ANY OF US WANT. BUT THE PENT POTENTIAL FOR SOME VIEWS. OF A ISN'T- HENCE OF DIAPERS QUESTION WOULD BE- IN REGARD TO HOW THE HELL TIME IS DEFINED IN THIS BILL IN TERMS TO BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PROVISIONS. YES THEY WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY OF THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS- TO ESTABLISH THE- IN STATE TUITION. AND THERE'S- IN THE- IN THE ANALYSIS OF THERE'S A WHOLE EXPLANATION OF THE SATISFACTION OF THE REQUIREMENTS- AND IT IS THREE OR MORE. YEARS IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE TIME FRAME BUT THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD APPLY TO ANYBODY. RIGHT LONG AS YOU HAVE THREE YEARS AND YOU MEET AND THOSE OTHER REQUIREMENTS IT'S NOT JUST THAT THREE YEARS BUT IT'S- THREE YEARS PLUS THESE OTHER REQUIREMENTS. SO IF YOU LIVE IN COLORADO AND YOU CAME HERE. THAT WOULD BE THE SAME THING- IN OTHER WORDS THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR AB FIVE FORTY THAT WOULD APPLY TO ANYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THAT CAME FROM. SO I'M I'M OF. IN ANY MEET THE SAME STANDARDS AND NOT CHANGE THE STANDARD. OKAY BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF- YOUR FAMILY A AN AFFLUENT FAMILY FROM OUT OF THE COUNTRY- THE POVISIONS OF YOUR BILL AS YOU PROPOSE IT THAT YOU'D BE ABLE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA AND AS LONG AS YOU WERE HERE FOR THREE YEARS AND UNDER UP A BILL THAT I THINK I VOTED FOR EARLIER THIS YEAR WOULD MOVE IT DOWN TO TWO YEARS BUT- YOU WOULD THEN GET THAT SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL BREAK I MEAN THAT WITH YOURS- CHILD SAID TO USE D. I BELIEVE THE BREAK OUT OF THAT THEY GET UNDER UNDER. THESE PROVISIONS IS TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LESS IN TUITION SO IF YOU CAME HERE FOR TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS CENTER FIVE FORTY. YOU COULD BE SAVING YOURSELF EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BY MAKING THAT MOVE TO CALIFORNIA THAT THAT'S MY READING OF IT UNDER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT TO MY MIND UNDERSTAND THAT WRONG. WELL- OKAY THANK YOU YEAH PLEASE PROCEED SO- THE KERN AB FIVE FORTY WILL STATES YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE THREE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION- IN CALIFORNIA OR- FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION SO IT'S NOT JUST THREE YEARS LIVING IN THE STATE IS DID YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL. AND RIGHT NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE STAFF. ANY GUY WHO CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL YOU ELIGIBLE. FOR IN SITU ALL THIS IS THIS WOULD ADDING A GRADUATE FROM CATHOLIC HIGH SCHOOL. AND NOW I WOULD BE LYING TO PAY IN STATE TUITION. RIGHT SO OF BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY THAT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO ENROLL YOUR CHILD IN THE SCHOOL EXACTLY TO MEET THE TEST. METHOD AND MAYBE OUR CONSULTANT MENTOR THE ANSWER THIS AND THAT AFFECTING OTHERS TOO. BUT A TO ESTABLISH RESIDENCY IN OUR STATE TODAY- AND BE ELIGIBLE FOR IN STATE TUITION IS AT A SINGLE YEAR IF YOU ESTABLISH RESIDENCY. YES I'M HEARING A YES FROM THE CONSULTANT SO. REALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CLASSIFICATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT. SEEN AS RESIDENTS CITIZENRY RESIDENTS RIGHT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIVE THREAD THE NEEDLE THROUGH- AND- SO THAT'S A PART OF THE BILL THAT HAS ME A LITTLE A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT ABILITY FOR IT TO BE EXPLOITED I THINK THAT YOUR GOALS ARE ADMIRABLE. AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE USED IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT'S WHAT I'M STILL STRUGGLING. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER DOLLY I WASN'T GOING TO ASK A QUESTION BUT YOUR COMMENT ABOUT OUT OF STATE. SO HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO WHAT SENATOR GLAZERS ASKING ABOUT THE ONE YEAR. TUITION BREAK. WELL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S AN OUT OF STATE PERSON. OF WOULD BE WE HAVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB FIVE FORTY AND EIGHTY FIVE FORTY SAYS THREE OR MORE YEARS OF FULL TIME ATTENDANCE. OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS YOU KNOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL. RIGHT. DOES THAT THAT'S ONLY IF THERE. NONCITIZEN IF THEY WERE IF THEY WERE A CITIZEN. IT'S ONE YEAR RIGHT NOW CORRECT. YOU'RE WELCOME ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER TROUBLE SO I JUST WANTED TO LET IS IT EVEN. NOW UCSB GRADUATE SO YES GO CHARACTERS ON THAT AND JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BUT I AM- SO I SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT THE- PROPER- I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I THINK. THE CONCERN IS THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE ASKING IS. THEY'RE VERY FAIR- I ACTUALLY SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS YES WE DO WANT TO MAKE IT- EKEROT GONNA HAVE PURITY- BUT WHEN YOU'RE- A HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW. ONE A RESIDENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SOMEONE THAT MOVES FROM OUT OF STATE- SOMEONE WHO HAS A VISA RESIDENT VERSUS THE NON THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE AN IN KIND OF CURIOUS THAT THEY TOLD YOU TO EXPIRE OF YOU SAID BEFORE YOU KNOW SO THAT YOU CAN GET IN STATE WE DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE. YOU KNOW. ILLEGAL YOU KNOW- OUT BALANCING COMPONENT SO. I I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BUT I THINK. AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHO DECIDES WHAT. TIME IS TO ACCOMMODATE THE FINANCIAL- BENEFITS THAT MAKES IT YOU KNOW PRETTY. FARE BETWEEN A CITIZEN SOMEONE WHO IS- IN IMMIGRANT OR MIGRANT TO THE TO THIS COUNTRY AND WHEN THAT COMES THROUGH THE VISA AND SO FORTH BUT- I THINK IT'S THREE YEARS YOU SAID FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TO YEARS OF. COLLEGE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN IF YOU'RE A US CITIZEN COMING FROM OUT OF STATE IT'S ONE YEAR CORRECT SO YOU'RE STILL PAYING KIND OF A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN I AM I'M JUST GONNA HERE'S TO KNOW WHAT THE THOUGHTS ARE OF MY COLLEAGUES AS FAR AS- DO THEY FEEL THAT THAT SET A FAIR. MAKE UP THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS. YEAH I MET YEARS I'M AM I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY KEEPING IT MOVING- SENATORS RAZA THAT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS THE EXPERT IN BY SOME WEALTHY FOLKS FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY AND THE PALACES TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHERE ARE ARE STILL STUDENTS ARE COMING FROM BUT- THAT. USE VISIONS THIS ULTRA REALLY EXPLAIN SYSTEM. OF ADD TO THE NOT THE EMPIRE FOLKS DINO HE CARED ABOUT WE ALL CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE THESE ARE POTENTIALLY. AFFLUENT FAMILIES THAT ARE GOING TO JUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TYPE OF A PROVISION. TO GET A VISA COME HERE HAD. HAVE TO ENROLL THEIR KIDS IN IN SCHOOL FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THEN GET THAT ENORMOUS FINANCIAL BREAK. THAT THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THE BILL OKAY AND I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO KEEP IT MOVING BUT I HOPE THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT THAT PROVIDE THAT. SORT OF ABUSE BY THOSE WHO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PAY THE FULL FREIGHT. AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS A FATHER MY MIND AS WELL. WHEN WE CONSIDER THIS AND ONE- THE YOUNG. MEN AND WOMEN CAME TO MEDIATE ABOUT THIS THAT WAS A CONCERN OF MINE- BECAUSE THAT. THE BEFORE IS THAT THEY WERE REALLY- LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED LIVING HERE ALL THEIR LIVES- SO IN CONSIDERING THIS I ALSO BEGAN TO GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW THERE'S TWENTY TWO CLASSES OF MISSION IMMIGRATION ADMISSIONS INTO THIS COUNTRY IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND THIS GROUP AND BELIEVE ME YOU KNOW THEY OF. BECAUSE THEY A FULL I'M CLASSIC SEEN AS OKAY HERE ARE OF WEALTHY PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR EDUCATE SOUL. WE AGREED TO THESE AMENDMENTS THAT REALLY NARROWED IT DOWN TO JUST A FEW OF THE CLASSIFICATIONS AND AT AND YOU KNOW THEY BELIEVE. ARE AS THEY SHOULD THAT THERE ARE FAR FAR MORE MANY STUDENTS WHOSE FAMILIES ARE HERE WORK HARD REALLY CONTRIBUTING BUT JUST STUCK IN THIS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PLATE IN THE IN THE IMMIGRATION LAWS. WE DID OF ON THE COMMITTEE'S ADVICE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WE NARROWED IT DOWN. JUST LIFE SO I BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS WE'VE CAPTURED BASED ON THE VISAS THAT WE SELECTED- AND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE DEPENDENT- HAVE DEPENDENT VISAS THAT. IT'S A REASONABLE IT'S A GOOD THING TO DO AND IT'S NOT OPENING IT UP TO EVERYBODY TO EXPLOIT AND THEY HAVE TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE HERE THEIR PARENTS DO ANYWAY. THANK YOU CENTER DRIVE CENTER- DOLLY SO I WAS PREPARED TO VOTE AGAINST YOUR BILL AND SINCE THERE'S BEEN SOME GREAT DEBATE I'M ONLY OFTEN TRY TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAVING. I DO THINK THAT THERE'S- LOOK IF YOU'RE PAYING IN YOUR WORKING CALIFORNIA I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE SHOULD. YOU KNOW IT CONTINUE THAT BUT IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SO I MEAN ANYWAY I'M GONNA LAY OFF A YOUR BILL WHAT IS IT BY WE WERE IS IT IS GOING STRAIGHT APPROPRIATIONS AND THEN TO THE FLOOR. IT IS- BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS YEAH. WELCOME OKAY ANY OTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ALL RIGHT BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE SENATOR ALSO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK IT'S ALWAYS A WORRY AND THEY'RE ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. ANY SITUATION BUT WE CAN'T WORRY ABOUT. A FEW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT TAKE ADVANTAGE THE SITUATION WE WERE POTENTIALLY GOING TO HELP HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS. OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO GO TO COLLEGE MANY YEARS AGO WE OPENED A FOOD PANTRY. AT MY LOCAL UNION THAT I RAN AND I TOLD THE STAFF I SAID. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE 5% WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM WORRY ABOUT THE 95% OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE HELPING EVERY DAY BY FEEDING THEM. SO I WOULD JUST GIVE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE WE WOULD LIKE NO ONE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY SITUATION EVER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S JUST NOT LIFE FOR ME I LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. THAT WILL BE HELPING REALLY NEEDY STUDENTS AND DISTRICT DESERVING STUDENTS. OF THAT SURPRISE I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WELL I PRETTY THE CONVERSATION I THINK THEIR EXACT OLD.

B. THIRTEEN OH EIGHT PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU ARE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SB THIRTEEN OH EIGHT RICHARD SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA JOBS BY CLARIFYING AND STRENGTHENING BUY AMERICAN POLICIES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGE MEAL PROGRAMS. CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY IS THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY AND PRODUCES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES. OVER ONE THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES. AND TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY'S FRUITS AND NUTS. OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WORK IN CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. IN THE- AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY FROM FARMERS FARMWORKERS TO WORKERS IN FOOD PROCESSING AND CANNERIES. UNION JOBS IN CALORIES IN FRUIT PROCESSING PROVIDE GOOD WAGES BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT SECURITY TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS. WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST LABOR STANDARDS AND WORKER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE. CALIFORNIA AND U. S. GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE PRODUCED UNDER THE STRICTEST REGULATIONS TO ENSURE FOOD SAFETY. REDUCES ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CAREFULLY MANAGE PESTICIDE USE. AND CONSERVE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH ACT INCLUDES BUY AMERICAN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE SCHOOL FOOD AUTHORITIES THE SFA'S. TO PURCHASE DOMESTIC PRODUCTS TO SERVE MEALS IN SCHOOLS TO. THE BILL AND- D. A. REGULATIONS SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN BYPASS THE EXISTING BUY AMERICAN REQUIREMENT AND PURCHASE IMPORTED FOOD PRODUCTS IF THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT COST DIFFERENTIAL NOTS THAT LANGUAGE IN THE IN THE BILL. BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND IMPORTED FOOD PRODUCTS PRODUCTS HOWEVER IT THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT SIGNIFICANT COST DIFFERENTIAL MEANS THAT ALLOWS THE SCHOOL TO BYPASS THIS REQUIREMENT. EIGHT TWENTY SEVENTEEN REVIEW OF SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAMS BY THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT MOST OF THE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THEY REVIEWED HAD ADEQUATE POLICY HAD INADEQUATE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO DOCUMENT DISCOUNT. DIFFERENTIAL ALL SIX HAD PURCHASED FOREIGN SEUSS SOURCED FOOD ITEMS BUT DID NOT HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION TO JUSTIFY THEIR PURCHASES NATIONALLY OVER 80% OF THE APPLE JUICE PURCHASE PURCHASED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS FROM CHINA. AND 60% 62806270% OF THE FISH STICKS SERVED IN SCHOOLS AND YOU REMEMBER FIFTY FISH STICKS IT SCHOOLS I'M SUREARE MADE. YOU ARE MADE FISH ON RUSSIAN BESCH VESSELS AND PROCESS IN CHINA. SCHOOLS IN MORE THAN HALF THE COUNTRY ALSO HAVE PURCHASED CHINESE CANNED PEACHES AND WE GROW PEACHES RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT OF THE BUY AMERICAN LAXITY CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS PURCHASE LOWER QUALITY FOODS PRODUCED UNDER LESS STRINGENT WORKER HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS DESPITE LIVING IN THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL REGION OF THE WORLD. THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS FELT THE IMPACT OF OVERSEAS COMPETITION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SENECA FOODS A PRODUCER OF PEACH AND FRUIT COCKTAIL PRODUCTS SHUTTERED ITS MODESTO PLANT PERMANENTLY LAYING OFF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE FULL TIME WORKERS. AND ONE THOUSAND SEASONAL WORKERS THE COMPANY CITED IMPORT COMPETITION FROM OVERSEAS CHINA AND EUROPE AS A REASON FOR THE PLANT CLOSURE IN THIS HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. SB THIRTEEN OH EIGHT WILL CLARIFIED AND STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S BY AMERICAN POLICY BY URGING ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. TO PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS GROWN PACKAGED OR PROCESSED IN THE UNITED STATES UNLESS THE PRICE OF THE FOREIGN PRODUCT IS MORE THAN 25% CHEAPER. SB THIRTEEN OH EIGHT DOES NOT MANDATE WHAT KIND OF PROJECTS SCHOOLS MUCH MUST PURCHASE ONLY THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES THE BILL PROVIDE SCHOOLS THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ADJUST MENUS AND PROCUREMENT TO AVOID INCREASED COSTS AND GIVE THEM A SAFETY VALVE VALVE IF THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE AFFORDABLE DOMESTIC PRODUCT AVAILABLE. THIS UP BUY AMERICAN POLICIES ENSURE CHILDREN CONSUME FOOD OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND SAFETY IT'S REFLECTIVE OF OUR VALUES BY SUPPORTING LOCAL FARMERS JOBS AND THE ECONOMY AS WELL IT IS REINFORCING CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT. AS A WORLD LEADER ON CLIMATE CHANGE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS AND LABOR PROTECTION SO I KNOW THAT THE STAKE. HOLDERS HAVE RAISED SOME REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES- ABOUT THE BILL AND HOW IT WORKS AND I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK AND THE SCHOOL NUTRITION DIRECTORS IN WORK WORKERS DO EVERY DAY TO FEED. OUR KIDS HEALTHY AND NOURISHING MEALS M. NO THAT I CAN I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT OVER OVERLY BURDENSOME- AND- CONTINUED AT TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW THERE THERE IS SOME.

THIRTEEN AWAIT BY SENATOR SENATOR CABALLERO THE BILL CLARIFIES BY AMERICAN COMPLAINTS BY RESTRICTING PUBLIC SCHOOLS FROM PURCHASING AGRICULTURAL FOOD PRODUCTS NOT GROWN OR PACKED DOMESTICALLY UNLESS THE COST OF THE NON DOMESTIC PRODUCT IS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. LOWER THAN THE PRICE OF THE DAY. AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS BILL. TWO LARGE FRUIT CANNERIES IN KINGSBURG AND MODESTO EMPLOYING THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS CLOSED IN THE PAST DECADE CITING IMPORT COMPETITION AS A PRIMARY REASON. INDEED IN REAL VOLUME PERCENTAGE OF IMPORTED FOOD SERVICE CANNED PEACHES HAS BEEN AS HIGH AS 40% CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY IS MEETING EXCEPTIONAL STANDARDS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS PROVIDE FARE A COMPETITIVE OMPENSATION ENSURE FOOD SAFETY REDUCE WATER USE BOOST ENERGY EFFICIENCY FULLY MANAGE PESTICIDE USE AND IMPLEMENT CLIMATE SMART AG PRACTICES. SB THIRTEEN AWAIT REFLECTS THESE CALIFORNIA VALUES BY. DOLLAR TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PURCHASE FOOD PRODUCTS WHICH MEET THESE HIGH STANDARDS IT DOES NOT PREVENT THE PURCHASE OF FOREIGN SOURCED FOOD. RATHER IT WILL ENSURE BY AMERICAN COMPLAINTS FOR UP 225% A 25% COST DIFFERENTIAL. INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE EVEN PRE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN THE ANYTHING BELOW THAT THRESHOLD IS NOT ENOUGH TO AVOID DISPROPORTIONATE PURCHASE OF FOREIGN SOURCED FOOD.

HAVE TO PAY HIGHER COSTS FOR FUEL AND HIGHER COSTS ELECTRICITY AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS SO- I SUPPORT THE BILL.

THANK YOU CENTER DOLLY WAS RESTING YOUR CALL A COUPLE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I CAN DO IT IN THE IN MY CLOTHES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU CENTRO CHOI BOGUE. THE SO. IN MERRITT I ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT HAS TO DO WITH OTHER JUST DENTAL AND LOCAL COMPANIES WHEN IT COMES TO. OUR BASED COMPANIES ARE WORKING CALIFORNIA FOR- THE VISA EMERGENCY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE AS- SOMEONE WHO COMES WITH SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE FACTORY- AND THEN VERY SUPPORTER OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN IN CALIFORNIA OUR CULTURE FOR MY DISTRICT. JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I. I BELIEVE IT I'M I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS ABOUT- ONE HOW DID WE COME UP THE 25% BECAUSE WITH INFLATION AND EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- IMPACT IS THAT. IS THAT GOING TO COVER ALL OF THE COST. ASSOCIATED IN TRYING TO KEEP EVERYTHING WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT FIGURE AND NUMBER TWO. HOW HOW WE STUDY OR HAVE HAS THERE BEEN ANY FEEDBACK WITH REGARDS TO THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE WITH- OUR ABILITY TO EXPORT. OUT PRODUCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES AND- IN OTHER STATES IF WE DO THIS AND IMPLEMENT THIS BECAUSE IT'S- SORT OF GOES ALONG WITH THE NOTION OF THE SHOP LOCAL AND I REMEMBER BACK YOU KNOW EIGHT OR NINE. WE START HAVING ALL OF THE- LOCAL CITIES ARE PROMOTING SHOPPING OR NOT I ALL I COULD THINK OF IN MY HEAD WILL FALL SHOPPING LOCAL THEN YOU KNOW WOULD. WITH IT WHEN YOU GO. SPORTING COMMUNITIES AND IN SO FORTH I WAS MORE OF A- HOW ABOUT WE ALL JUST SHOP. AND WHO IN THE IN THE REGION TO HELP ALL OF OUR OUR COMMUNITY SO I'M JUST GONNA TREES OF THE- OF. THE POTENTIAL CONCERNS OF THE IMPACT IN OUR ABILITY TO EXPORT. IF WE IMPLEMENT SOMETHING OF THIS SORT HEARING IN CALIFORNIA. MANAGER WOULD YOU PER WHAT WOULD YOU ALLOW. ME TO ENTER THIS WINTER OKAY SO THE- THE SH THE SHOP. IN REGARDS TO THE SHOP LOCAL FOR THE PURCHASE BY AMERICAN OR OR BY BY CALIFORNIAN IT'S A BUY AMERICAN SO IT'S ANY ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT OBVIOUSLY WE PAY SO MUCH OF IT THAT IT WOULD HELP OUR FARMERS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT IS- IT WOULD NOT AFFECT ANY OF OUR TRADE AGREEMENTS AND WE HAVE A TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH. ALL OF THE- FACT IT OR TRADE AGREE AND THAT'S REALLY THE LEGAL- ISSUE THAT- THAT- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS. WHICH IS ON. IT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT DOESN'T AFFECT THAT THE 25% BASICALLY WAS ARRIVED AT BY- BY A- TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PUT ON OUR FARMERS- THE ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS THE- LABOR REQUIREMENTS THE- SAFETY STANDARDS THAT BET THE REQUIRED THE RIDICULOUS TORY FRAMEWORK. AND THAT NUMBER WAS- WAS A NUMBER THAT WE DECIDED WAS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH SO THAT YOU. ARE ARE- LOCAL. AG COMPANIES COULD COMPETE ON THE WORLD MARKET- AGAINST OTHER COUNTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE REASON THAT THEY'RE SO. INEXPENSIVE TO BUY IS THAT THE QUALITY IS NOT S HIGH- AND THAT'S- THAT'S JUST THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY PRODUCE- FRUITS AND NUTS INCLUDED OF ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT THERE'S A COST THAT COMES WITH IN THEIR ALSO A FOOD. AT THE HIT THE- BECAUSE JUST DOESN'T MEET THE QUALITY THAT WE EXPECT IN ORDER FOR IT TO GET TO THE MARK- AND SO. THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE FIVE CAME 25% CAME FROM IS THAT- IT IT IT PUT SET UP. IT IT PUT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY AMERICAN PRIDE OF PRODUCTS DOESN'T HAVE ANY NUMBER AT ALL THEY JUST BASICALLY SAY- REASONABLE- AND WE- PICKED UP A NUMBER SO THAT WAY WE COULD. MORE ACCURATELY ON TO- THAT WHAT IT IS THAT ON THE DATE BUT PRODUCT MIGHT. THAT NUMBER THAT THAT WE WANT PEOPLE DO IT AT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACHIEVE IS THAT WE WANT THEM TO BUY LOCALLY OR NATIONALLY PRODUCED FRUITS VEGETABLES AND NUTS- AS LONG AS THE MARGIN IS NOT MORE THAN 25% LESS- THE MARCH. TWENTY MORE. FULLER QUESTION TO THE CHAIR- SO THE OTHER- BUDGIES THE OTHER COMMENT THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE WAS WITH REGARDS TO YOU- I KNOW SENATOR SKINNER HAD A BILL LAST YEAR WERE WHERE YOU CAME TO UNIVERSAL MEALS FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS- K. THROUGH TWELVE BASICALLY IF I'M NOT MISTAKING KEITH IS RALPH. IN AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT STRUCK ME ON HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WAS THAT- WE WEREN'T TAPPING ALL OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS- THAT WERE AB THAT CALIFORNIA WAS ENTITLED TO- WHEN HE CAME TO THE MEAL. WE JUST HAVE. THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THAT'S WHY SHE'S SORT OF A MADE THAT POINT WITH IN SUPPORT OF HER BILL I END UP SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL IF WE ARE NOT TALKING A LITTLE SPECIAL FUNDS THEN PERHAPS WE COULD. SUPPORT THIS BILL SO THAT WE CAN GET THOSE HANDS WITH THIS WITH THIS SPELL. IF WE WERE TO NOT SURE WHERE THAT BELLE IS IF WE PASS IT OR NOT THEY WOULD HAVE SAID YES IS FUNDED SO- WITH THAT. HELP KIND OF PAY FOR THIS INCREASE OF 25% OR THIS IS COME OUT OF CALIFORNIA. TAXPAYERS BUDGET. SENATOR HOWEVER THE- THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS THAT WE GET MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ALSO GET FOOD SUBSIDIES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN. ALSO TRIBUTE TO ITIN TERMS OF THE FOOD PROGRAM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A U. S. D. A. PURCHASING AGREEMENT AS WELL AND THEY SEND A FOOD TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS I UNDERSTAND- AT AND SO WE'VE EXCLUDED THAT FROM THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RESPONSIBLE FOR SOMETHING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TAKING CARE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DESERVE YOU. THEY'RE NOT WE DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO WORRY ABOUT THAT- SO- THIS THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE PAID FOR WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS STATE FUNDS THAT'S WHERE THEY GET THEIR MONEY FOR THE FOOD. OKAY RIGHT THE- THANK YOU SENATOR CHOI BOGUE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE CENTER DOLLY RESTATE HIS QUESTIONS AND SET A GOAL LONGER THAN I THOUGHT I THINK I THINK I GOT IT UP IF BEEN TO ME MORE TO COME. I I'M- SO IN RE TO THE CORE THAT THERE THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED ON A NUMBER OF THE OF THE ISSUES AND BEEN DEALT WITH BY AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL- I'M IN IN PARTICULAR THE ISSUE ON THE U. S. D. A. FOOD THAT IS GIVEN TO THE SCHOOLS WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT TO EXACT- THE FOOD THAT'S PREPARED FOR ME WITH A FROM THE 25% AND SAYS. AT TO ISSUE ABOUT- AT SOME AVAILABLE- WE M. TOOK THAT WE MADE IT WE BASICALLY COPIED THE LANGUAGES IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAM- WE DON'T PRODUCE MANGOES ARE BANANAS AND FRANKLY I DON'T THAT THAT MAKES A WHOLE HECK THIS INTEREST TWO WEEKS BY PRODUCT. THEY CAN BUY THEM FROM FOR A FULL AND- PRODUCE. I'M AND THEIR ARE TIMES OF THE YEAR AS YOU KNOW WHERE- IT'S VERY HARD TO GET DOMESTIC. FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T PRODUCE SOME HERE IN THE COUNTRY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS SO- WE'RE BLESSED WITH SAID AND WEBER- BECAME DO SO. STONE COMMODITIES AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE- LETTUCES GROWN SOMEWHERE ELSE AND- AND SO AND SO IF YOU GET STRAWBERRIES IN THE WINTER YOU'RE NOT. IN THEM FROM FOREIGN AND- WHENEVER WE HAVE SNACKS OUT AND THERE'S THAT FRUIT FRESH. CALIFORNIA CERTAIN TIMES IN AND SO WE NEED TO A PRE THE FACT THAT- WE DO PRODUCE A LOT OF- THE MAJORITY OF ALMOST EVERYTHING BUT DURING CERTAIN TIMES A YEAR YOU CAN'T. AND SO THIS ALLOWS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS. YOU JUST HAVE. THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE- DOMESTICALLY AND YOU CAN GET IN FROM FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE SO WE'RE WORKING ON NON REALLY TAKING OFF THE ISSUES THAT THAT ARE OF CONCERN- WELL THIS MAY THIS COST MORE YES IT PROBABLY WELL ADMITS IT. HOUSE MORE TO PRODUCE THE HIGH QUALITY OF OUR OF OUR- THAT'S A BUDGET ISSUE WE CAN LOOK AT THAT- DOWN THE ROAD BUT- THIS. AND IT'S FOOD THING IN THE STATE HELLO- IT SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE FACT THAT WE CAN FEED- ARE ART OUR OUR STUDENTS AND- STUDENTS ALL THE WAY UP TO COLLEGE HAVE BILLY YOU DO IT HAVE A HIGH CALL IN STILL INVESTED IN A COP IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IT WOULD READ. BACK THE BATHROOM. THANK YOU SO CABALLERO JUST BE WE GET TO THE VOTE I- YOU ACKNOWLEDGED IT WHEN YOU FIRST SPOKE- I SUPPORT THE BILL- BEFORE IT TODAY I SUPPORT BY CALIFORNIA I AM- BUT I EMPATH IS WHAT SCHOOL OF.

MAN OF THE ROTH. NUMBER FIVE IS THIRTEEN EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS HI LEYVA AYE OCHO ABOVE AYE BOBOC AYE CORTEZ THE DALLAS. DALY I. GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE PANTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE MILITARY OUT YOU'RE VERY WELCOME WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE ABSENT ALL RIGHTS ARE ALLEN IS RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE BUT I MISSED I'M- IS. SENATE ARE YOU AND I'M SEVEN S. FOUR ONE FIRST READY THANK YOU MADAM. IN PARTICULAR- ATHLETES IN SPORTS TO GENERATE A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF REVENUE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S. FIRST LET ME THANK THE COMMITTEE- STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND- THE EXTENSIVE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND I ACCEPT TO COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- THE BILL THEN USED TO BUILD ON THE WORK. THAT THE LEGISLATURE DON TO ADDRESS. FLAYED STATION AS YOU WELL KNOW MORE RECENTLY S. B. TWENTY SIX M. S. RETOOL SIR DEATHS SKINNER. DOING WHAT NAME IMAGE TO LIE THAT. ON- FORTINO ONE AT. THAT GENERATE MASSES MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND WHERE ATHLETES RECEIVE ONLY THEIR SCHOLARSHIPS IN RETURN A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL REVENUE. AND AS YOU KNOW COLLEGE FOOTBALL BOWL DIVISION- FOOTBALL PLAYERS IN THIS DIVISION ONE MEN AND WOMEN. THE ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES IN STATE WHO DO NOT RECEIVE AT LEAST 50% OF THE REVENUE THAT THEY PRODUCE. LAST YEAR THE US SUPREME COURT RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT. IN THE IN SITU ES VERSUS AUSTIN. RULING THAT THE INSITU INSITU I WAS ACTING IN VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS BY LIMITING EDUCATION RELATED COMPENSATION THAT ATHLETES RECEIVE INTO TO A STILL RESTRICTS COMPENSATION THE SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE DIRECTLY TO THEIRS. ATHLETES ON RELATED TO THEIR EDUCATION. AND- THE- CLIENTS ARE MY PHONE AT ME AND- IS A ERRING OPINION ON THIS CASE JUSTICE GOVERNANCE STATED INTO TO A IS A MEMBER AND ITS MEMBERS ARE COLLEGE OF SUPPRESSING TO PAY OF STUDENT ATHLETES WHO COLLECTIVELY GENERATE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE FOR COLLEGES EVERY YEAR BUT THE STUDENT ATHLETE TO GENERATE THOSE REVENUES MANY UP AND WE GET OUR AFTER MEREKA FOR MORE TO COME BACK IN WHAT. ARE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR THE AND STATION. BRIEF COMPENSATION FUNDED INSURANCE 50% OF THE REVENUE GENERATED IN SPORTS GOES BACK TO THE ATHLETES INCENTIVIZE GRADUATION ASSIST WITH COST OF LIVING DURING COLLEGE AND GIVE BACK A FAIR SHARE OF THAT REVENUE HAT THE GENERATED. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS AND THERE IS A MOUNT THAT'S- DEPOSITED INTO A FUND AND ITS CALCULATED BY SUBTRACTING THE AMOUNT. OF THE GRANT IN AID SCHOLARSHIP IN THE SPORTS FROM FIFTY PERCENT OF THE REVENUE GENERATED IN SPORTS. A DIFFERENCE THEN IS DIVIDED AMONG EACH ATHLETE IN THAT SPORT. AN ATHLETE HAS IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO UP TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ACADEMIC YEAR AND SHE RECEIVED THE BALANCE OF THESE BONDS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF GRADUATION. AND IF THEY COMPLETE THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE. AS LONG AS I SHOULD SAY THE COMPLETE THIRD BACHELOR'S DEGREE WITHIN SIX YEARS. THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES POINTED OUT BY THE COMMITTEE ANALYSTS ANALYSTS THAT ON I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK IF THIS BILL MOVES TOWARD- FOR AN FIRST REGARDING OF THE FUNDAMENTAL AND CONTRACTING AGREEMENTS DONE NOW ALSO STATES THAT. WE SHOULD CONSIDER WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE MECHANISM TO THAT PROPERLY. COMPENSATE STUDENT ATHLETES WHILE ENSURING INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION'S ATHLETIC PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE SUSTAINED AN OPERABLE AND TO NOT DISRUPT CURRENT AND FUTURE CONTRACTS OF STAFF AND COACHES IT IS NOT OUR INTENT. THAT THESE FUNDS- ARE GIVEN TO ATHLETES BE TAKEN FROM WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO SUPPORT A FLAT PARTS OTHER ATHLETIC SPORTS AGENTS. AND WE'VE HEARD FROM SAM SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS- THAT EVER- REVENUE GENERATING SPORTS BY ONE POPULAR SUPPORT ON THEIR CAMPUS AND IS OFTEN USED TO FUND OTHER SPORTS THAT GENERATE LITTLE OR NO REVENUE WE DO NOT WANT TO CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE THE SPORT. IN SIMILAR ALSO ONE TO REMIND OF STAFF SALARIES AND PAY. INCREASES AND THAT- THAT HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AND WE SHOULD ALSO BE CONSCIOUS OF JUST HOW MUCH MONEY IS SPENT BY INSTITUTIONS ON COACHES RATHER THAN ATHLETES AS WE ALL KNOW MOST OF THESE COLLEGE COACHES ARE MULTI MILLIONAIRES. WHO BELONG TO EXCLUSIVE COUNTRY CLUBS AND USE PRIVATE CHARTER JETS TO COME TO THESE COMMUNITIES A RECRUIT THESE ATHLETES AND THEY CAN'T EVEN GET ON THE PLANE TO GO BACK HOME. DURING OFFSEASON. AN EXAMPLE OUT IN TWENTY ONE ACADEMIC YEAR U. S. C. SPENT TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON STUDENT. AID ACROSS ALL SPORTS. AND ALSO SPENT TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON COACHES SALARIES OF ALL SPORTS DESPITE THAT THEY'RE BEING TEN TIMES MORE. ATHLETES AND COACHES ANOTHER ISSUE ADDRESSED IN ANALYSIS AND DEFINITION OF REVENUE STATING THAT WE SHOULD SHOULD CONSIDER WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE BUT THAT UP. AT THE PURPLE RUBBER TICKET SALE APPAREL TELEVISION CONTRACTS ETCETERA IS CAPTURED WHEN CALCULATING ON. RECEIVES AND THEIR- CURRENTLY REVENUE CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ATHLETES FEES PAID BY GENERAL STUDENT BODY AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SIMPLY CAPTURING THE REVENUE THESE ATHLETES GENERATE FINALLY THAT ANALYSIS STATES THAT WE CONSIDER WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND ON DETERMINING THEM OUT OF STUDENT AID CAN WITHDRAW FROM THEIR DEGREE COMPLETION FUND BRACKET ACADEMIC YEAR CURRENTLY THE MOUNT AS STATED WAS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. HAS DROPPED INTO COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AT WE LOOKED AT THIS AMOUNT TO ASSIST ATHLETES WHO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH FOOD AND HOUSING INSECURITY AND OTHER LIFE EXPENSES AND ENSURE THAT. WE CAN FOCUS ON THEIR STUDIES AND ATHLETIC RESPONSIBILITIES WITHOUT FINANCIAL WORRIES THE BILL IS NOT PERFECT WE STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. AS YOU DO. IT COMES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY HERE TO TESTIFY. IS WERE MUGGY- HUM THE HOMA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL COLLEGE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION WILL ALSO READ TESTIMONY FROM STANFORD FOOTBALL ATHLETE ELIJAH HIGGINS REMOTELY IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE IS REQUEST WE ARE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR EFFORT AMANDA MODERATOR IF YOU COULD PULL UP A REMOTE KEY HOME AND YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS A MOBILE NUMBER. I'M A FORMER UCLA FOOTBALL PLAYER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NPA NATIONAL BECAUSE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU KEITH COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON SB FORTINO ONE. BECAUSE SPORTS. IS A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY THAT LEAVES MANY ATHLETES WITHOUT DEGREES. IN ABOUT HALF PROJECT IS WITH COLLEGE PLAYERS AND- ALL CALLED OUT HIS RECEIVER COMPENSATION. IT FACT APPOINTED IT THIS BILL- OUT THE SIMPLE COMPLEX AFTER MARKET RATE WHAT DO NOT ENTER MY PAY TO ALL AT THE SAMBADROME SPORTS. PHYSICAL VIOLATION GET UNDERSCORE FACT COUPLE BY CALL AT THE STATE THE MY SHARE OF. REVENUE AND SO THE WORST GRADUATION RATES. CAN CLOUDESLEY PROGRAMS RECRUITING IN THE BLACK REGULARLY BROKEN. IN CALIFORNIA FEDERAL GRADUATION RATES AMONG BLACK FOOTBALL PLAYERS AND BASKETBALL PLAYERS WITH 64% AND DIVISION ONE CALIFORNIA COLLEGES BLACK MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYERS GRADUATIONS RATES WERE 0% LAST SUMMER THE U. S. SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY FOUND OUT THE COMPENSATION THAT IS TO BE IN VIOLATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS. COLLEGES CONTINUE TO VOTE ANTI TRUST LAWS BY ILLEGALLY COLLUDING TO LIMIT AFTER A CONVERSATION. CALL THIS FALL THE CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE TO CUT SPORTS PAY US BEFORE TO NO ONE THE SPORTS WE PAID FOR WITH REVENUES AMOUNTS THEY WERE SO PASSED LONG AGO. AND THE MISUSE OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ANNUAL ATHLETICS REVENUE FROM 200-018-2000 EIGHTEEN. EXPOSES THE COLLEGES PARTIES DURING THIS PERIOD CALLED AFTER PARTICIPATION DROPPED BY SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR OUT THE- WHAT WHICH MONEY WAS SPENT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON LAVISH SALARIES AT THE CITIES. AND HIRING ADDITIONAL COACHES AND ATHLETIC ADMINISTRATORS OFFER FEWER ATHLETES. COLLEGES CONTINUED TO IMPOSE SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP ON CALIFORNIA'S ATHLETES HAS BECOME RACIAL EXPLOITATION. AND STIFLING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. SB FORTY NO ONE WOULD. THE A- OF ATHLETES. GRADUATE RATES WOULD SKYROCKET INSTEAD ASK FOR YES VOTE. AND I WAS ASKED BY YOU LIKE YOU CAN STANFORD FOOTBALL PLAYER TO REACH HIS- STEVEN IF THAT'S OKAY SINCE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE ON A IN THE OPPOSITION YES YOU CAN HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO TO THE LARGEST AGAIN STATEMENT. AS A HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE WAS ALWAYS MY DREAM TO PLAY BALL THE NEXT LEVEL. IT WAS DURING THE QUARTER OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL RECRUITING THAT I REALIZED HOW SPORTS WITH THE BUSINESS. THE BUSINESS. YOU ROLES. IS WITHOUT MUCH SUBSTANCE. IN HOPES THAT THESE KIDS SKILLS WOULD WIN BIG GAMES AND WIN BIG MONEY. THE CARD IS. MAKING A TOP ONE HUNDRED RATED PLAYER COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL I THOUGHT ALL. COACHES PROMISES QUICK GLAMOUR ANY LEGAL BRIBES DESIGNED WITH THEIR SCHOOL. I MADE MY DECISION TO ATTEND TEMPLE UNIVERSITY TO BE PART OF A COMMUNITY PROGRAM. THAT LIKE A MAJORITY OF BIG TIME COLLEGE FOOTBALL PROGRAMS PLACED A HIGH PRIORITY ON EDUCATION. UNFORTUNATELY I'VE LEARNED THAT PROTECTING EDUCATION IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT EVEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TAILORED FOR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. IS THE FACT THAT THE ACCUMULATED HOURS OF TRAINING PRACTICES LISTEN MEETINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO BE COMPARED TO THAT OF A FULL TIME JOB. SURVEYS SHOW THAT pDESPITE THE INTO TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK LIMIT CONFLICTS ACTIVITY. PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY EXCEED THIS LIMIT AND I THINK SPEND UP TO FIFTY HOURS PER WEEK. FOR A LOT. RUBIO THAT CALLS FOOTBALL IS A BUSINESS AND AS BUSINESS HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NEGATIVE AFFECT ON BOTH PLAYERS. THE MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN LIKE MYSELF. THE SYSTEM IS SET UP TO RING UP THE TOWNS OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD AND MONETIZE BILLIONS IN THE PROCESS. 98% OF THESE ATHLETES WILL GO PRO. AND MANY RIGHT ABOUT HALF OF THEM WILL HAVE CHRONIC BECAUSE SPORTS INJURIES BUT NONE OF THEM WILL RECEIVE A PROPORTIONAL WRITTEN IN THE TO CREATE ON THE FIELD WITH THE JUSTICES TAKE PLACE NOT HIGHLY PRAISED INDUSTRY WHICH ON ITS OWN WILL NOT ADDRESS THE NEGATIVE ASPECTS BROUGHT BY THE INTERSECTION AUDI OF BEING A COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYER AND THE STUDENTS. I ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES AND AS YOU KNOW WILL PROVIDE MUCH A MUCH NEEDED STRUCTURE FOR CREATING SOLUTIONS KEEP PROBLEM. OKAY BECAUSE WITHIN THE- THANK YOU.

HELLO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- SENATOR BRADFORD I HAVE. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- THE FIRST ONE BEING HOW ARE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH TITLE NINE GIVEN THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL AND SECOND PART PAYMENTS WOULD BE DIRECTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO MALE ATHLETES WHAT ABOUT FEMALE ATHLETES THAT'S NOT THE CASE YOU WOULDN'T BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH ALL ATHLETES WITH BROMLEY. OF BOWLS ITS STATE FOOTBALL IS A LARGE REVENUES ALSO FIRST TAKING CARE OF THOSE BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT OFF ATHLETES BUILD PARTICIPANTS PROGRAM- IN PROPORTION TO THE REVENUE THAT THEY GENERATE THE GENERATE SHOWED AND SO FAR EVEN WITH THE- BLACKENED. INDIVIDUAL TAKEN GREATEST BALLAD OF OUR THE WOMEN ATHLETES OF FOR THEIR THE WANT TO SIGN MORE CONTRACTS- SINCE WEEK PASSED THAT BILL THAN A MALE ATHLETES BUT WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE TITLE NINE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING SO I WILL LET REMOTELY ANSWER- IT PROVIDE. ANY OTHER TECHNICAL- ADVISOR. TO JUST INJURE IT. RESELLING CLOCK. DID THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SARATOGA WOULD YOU LIKE HIM TO ANSWER WE WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANSWER HOW CAN I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHERS OKAY. PLEASE PROCEED SIR. SURE SHOWS NOTHING ENOUGH BEFORE TO NO ONE. WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF TITLE NINE AND IT ASSURES THAT ANY ATHLETE THAT FALLS UNDER THE- 50% THRESHOLD RECEIVING REVENUE- WITH IT WAS NOT DISCRIMINATE- ENOUGH TO KEEP PART OF TOTAL NINE THAT. ANY KIND OF- YOU KNOW POLICY OR ACTION THAT DISCRIMINATES BASED ON SEX WOULD BE A PROBLEM BUT THIS ASSURE THAT ALL ACTRESS OR RECEIVE. 50% OF REVENUE IN THE SPORT. OKAY AND- SO FOR THE RECORD CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH HOW THE FUND IS SUPPOSED TO BE CALCULATED IN DISTRIBUTED. GOT A QUESTION FOR ME YES YOUR SEAT. SURE SO- BASICALLY YOU NEED SUPPORT- IT IS IT IS STUDENTS THAT. WORK TAKES THE POOL REVENUE OF THE SPORT AND AS THE TRACKS WITH THE COLLEGES ARE PAYING THE PLAYERS THE COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY PAYING PLAYERS IN THE FORM OF SCHOLARSHIP WHICH IS A FORM OF COMPENSATION THAT'S BEEN. A VERY MUCH BETTER IN THE FEDERAL COURTS SCHOLARSHIPS ARE COMPENSATION FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES- ANY ATHLETES THAT AS A GROUP ARE NOT RECEIVING AT LEAST RECEIVE A SUBSIDY FROM THEIR FROM THEIR SCHOOL- PURSUANT TO A BILL LANGUAGE IN AT FOURTEEN ZERO ONE WHICH WOULD MEAN THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS IMMEDIATELY TOOK TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR. ON ANYTHING IN EXCESS WOULD BE WITH A CONDITIONAL UPON ULTIMATE COMPLETION UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AT THAT POINT THE SCHOOL WOULD BE- TO VERIFY- IMPROVE AND PROVIDE THE FUNDS. SO HAPPY TO FOR INSTANCE WERE THEY'RE RECEIVING. 50% BURKE AND REVENUE AT THE TIME BEING THERE WOULD NEED UP THERE WOULD BE NO. DEGREE COMPLETION ALLOCATION THEY HAVE THEIR ARTERIES. MARKET VALUE FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR WORK. THANK YOU IN ONE LAST- QUESTION AND COMMENT THERE HOW WILL OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT GENERATE ANY REVENUE THIS BILL WOULD DIVERT CRITICAL RESOURCES FOR ALL STUDENTS TO JUST A SELECT FEW YEARS. REVENUE GENERATED BY MEN'S FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL IS USED TO SUPPORT ALL ATHLETIC TEAMS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE CAMPUS FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL SEDGLEY SUBSIDIZE OTHER SPORTS. AS STATED WE MADE SURE THAT WE WOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE HE OF THE CURRENT FUNDING OF THOSE OTHER SPORTS IT'S ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE. COSTS THAT WOULD GO INTO THE FUNDS SO IF YOUR SOCCER TEAM IS GETTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY WOULD STILL CONTINUE TO GET A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SCHOLARSHIPS OR SUBSIDIES OR WHATEVER THAT AMOUNT IS. THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTRO CHAU BOOKS CENTER GLAZER HEARTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE ON THIS AND YOU HAVE GREAT LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE HONESTLY I'VE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THIS BILL IS GOING TO WORK IN PRACTICE. WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED YOU KNOW MIGHT CONFUCIUS CLASSICALLY DIPS LEMME SEE IF I CAN WORK THROUGH IT. AND WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT. THIS BILL APPLIES TO BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CULTURES RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I KNOW OF FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE STATE UNIVERSITY- SO MAYBE WE CAN START IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE I CERTAINLY THINK. EFFORTS TO GO AFTER HE LEADS. EXCEPTIONAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPLOIT. THAT'S LIKE OVER HERE. BUT THE BROAD SWATH OF WHERE THIS BILL APPLIES WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER. THAT THAT IT SHOULD BE APPLICABLE IN THAT SPACE SO- WE HAVE TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES. I CAME FROM SAN DIEGO STATE AS YOU. BELIEVES THE POSITIVE WAY- ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING MOST OUTSTANDING OF THE STATE UNIVERSITIES- AND I DID HAVE TO USE IN EUROPE ONE OF THE LEAGUE'S. I DID HAVE FAMILIARITY WITH THEIR ATHLETIC BUDGET BECAUSE IT WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE FUNDING OF TITLE NINE AND- WOMEN'S ATHLETICS WHEN I WAS ON THE CAMPUS. AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS CHANGED- BUT BUT- THERE WERE ONLY TWO SPORTS THE GENERATED ANY REVENUE. THAT WAS FOOTBALL AND MEN'S BASKETBALL. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS CHANGED SINCE OUR YEARS. HAVE GONE BY AND I DON'T IMAGINE THERE ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES. SO IF PART OF THE CRITERIA IS THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. THAT IS THAT YOU GET YOU HAVE A SPORT THAT GENERATES REVENUE WILL MOST SPORTS. DON'T GENERATE ANY REVENUE- AND SO WE REALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT THE EXPLOITATION AND COMPENSATION OF BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL PLAYERS REALLY IF THAT'S IF THAT'S HOW YOUR BILL IS APPLIED IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S THE HEART OF IT IS THE IS THAT THAT SPACE MIGHT NOT. THEY ARE THE LARGEST GENERATOR BUT THIS IS TO BE APPLIED UPLIFT POLITICALLY ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL SPORTS ABOVE THAT THRESHOLD IF THERE'S NO MONEY ABOVE THAT 50% THRESHOLD OR YOU WANT TO CONSIDER PROFIT THEN NO ONE'S IMPACT IT'S NO MONEY TO BE GIVEN OUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO PAY SOMEBODY IF THE REVENUE IS NOT THERE. IF THE YOU HAVE TO FIRST BREAK REVENUES STILL RIGHT WELL GETS IN PLACE STATE OF FALSE PROMISE THAT REALLY UNDER THE L. AS YOU TO EXPLAIN IT UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS BILL 95% OF THE ATHLETE BY NUMBER ON A CSU CAMPUS IS NOT GONNA BE THIS BILL IS NOT COMPLIED OF. LIKE NAY MITCHELL I THIS I'M GONNA APPLY TO EVERYBODY BUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT AND IT BEATS THE SYSTEM THAT OUT RIGHT NOW I CAN'T EVEN AND- IF YOU- COLLEGES. YOU HAVE. COACHES MAKING. WERE SIX FIGURES ME- OF pATHLETIC DIRECTORS WHO WERE MAKING HALF A MILLION DOLLARS PLUS SO- THERE'S REVENUE FOR THEM SO WE'RE JUST SAYING. RIGHT AND I KNOW WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE AND I THINK THAT IS AN INTERESTING. CONVERSATION ABOUT- COLLEGE SPORTS CENTER CAMPUSES IN HOW WE PAY COACHES AND ATHLETIC DIRECTORS I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. AND I THINK THAT'S A WORD. VERSION OF BECAUSE AS- INTAKE GRADE HISTORY TEACHER A GREAT IN TEACHER CLAIMED RESEARCHER. MANY PUBLICATIONS AND THEY'RE JUST GETTING BY AND WE HAVE COACHES THE TACKETT GET ME IN THE MILLIONS SO I HEAR YOU THERE- BUT I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S AN ISSUE OF THE ATHLETES BEING EXPLOITED. AND THAT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO CREATE THIS REVENUE GENERATOR WHICH YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT FOCUSES ON GRADUATION. BECAUSE THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF EXPLOITATION OUR SYSTEM WHERE WE GET THE KIDS TO GET AT YOU KNOW. STUDY HARD GET INTO UNIVERSITY BOB. AND WHATEVER THEY NEED. FIVE GET THAT. I DO TO GET TAE THOSE CLASSES AND THEN BY MOST OF MANY OF THEM DON'T GET A DEGREE. AND THEY HAVE DEBT AND HAVE NOTHING THAT'S A BROADER ISSUE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON AS YOU MAY KNOW IN THAT SPACE YOU'RE- IN THE SENATE PRIOR TO THAT THE- AT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. LEVEL SO I SEE THAT AS A GENERAL PROBLEM BUT YOU'RE A IT SEEMS LIKE IN THIS BILL. YOU FOCUS ON THAT GRADUATION ELEMENT THAT THAT EVEN. AFTER IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY MONEY OR A PART OF THIS MONEY AND LESS ACTUALLY GRADUATE IN SIX YEARS RESERVE THEY'RE NOT. ELIGIBLE UNLISTED GRADUATED SIX YEARS THAT THE COP IT ALL THE WAY. BASED ON THE FACTOR OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. PER SEMESTER BUT THE RESERVE THAT'S PUT INTO GRADUATION POOL THEY CAN'T TOUCH THAT UNLESS THEY GRADUATE THEY HAVE TO GRADUATE WITHIN A SIX YEAR. PERIOD GOT IT WELL I WOULD SAY THIS THAT THAT I THERE'S A LOT ABOUT THIS BILL THAT I THAT I THINK IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I WOULD REALLY I THINK WE WOULD BENEFIT. FROM HAVING THESE REAL PRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF THE UNIVERSITY A HERE'S HOW IT WOULD WORK. UNIVERSITY BE HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. I THINK THAT WOULD HELP ME AND I YOU KNOW THIS IS A FOR. THE LAST WEEK I HAD A REAL TOUGH TIME GET MY HANDS AROUND THIS. AND I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW EVERYTHING HERE BUT- WE DON'T I DON'T. AND I JUST RUBBLE WITH THIS ONE BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR HEARTS IN THAT DIRECTION ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I. I STILL STRUGGLING TO SEE THE PRAGMATIC AFFECTED. SAN DIEGO STATE OR CSU DOMINGUEZ HILLS. L. LET. I CAN I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT USC. HE LEADS- BUT AT THIS BILL IS GONNA BE APPLICABLE TO A BROAD ARRAY OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WHICH I CARE A LOT ABOUT AND I KNOW YOU DO TOO. AND I STRUGGLE TO SEE EXACTLY. HOW THIS IS GONNA COULD COME INTO PLAY UC DAVIS SACRAMENTO STATE CETERA. BUT IF THERE'S NO. PROFIT GENERATED IT DOESN'T IMPACT ME IN A WAY YOU GOT A FIRST EVER PROFIT. IF YOU'RE NOT GENERATING IT. IT'S GOING TO BE LEAVING THE PLAYING FIELD AS IT IS TODAY THEY'LL JUST. SHIP BUT IF IT'S NOTHING ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT SCHOLARSHIP THAT. IT'S PROFITABLE IT'S NO MONEY TO BE GIVEN OUT ANYWAY. RIGHT SO PRAGMATICALLY THAN TAKE SACKS STATE HOW DOES THAT WORK WITHIN THEIR ATHLETIC BUDGET TODAY I WOULD REALLY HELP ME TO SEE WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE UNIVERSE IS GOING TO DO THIS THING BECOMES LAW THEY'RE GONNA SAY OKAY HOW DO WE MAKE THIS WORK IN OUR BUDGET. HOW MANY ATHLETES DO WE HAVE AND WHAT SPORTS AND WHAT REVENUES GENERATED AND WHAT WILL THIS MEAN FOR THE SET ASIDE AND YOU SAY THE MONEY CAN'T BE TAKEN FROM PROGRAMS OKAY WHERE IS THAT MONEY. GOING TO COME FROM BECAUSE THAT REVENUE GENERATION I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW EVERY UNIVERSITIES DIFFERENT BUT A LOT OF THE STATE UNIVERSITIES THEY'RE NOT PROFIT CENTERS ARE TRYING TO BREAK EVEN I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE CUTTING SPORTS BECAUSE THEY CLAIM AT LEAST. THANK AT BREAK EVEN THAT WE HEAR ALL THE TIME ON THE CAMPUS WHEN THEY START PLAYING BASEBALL AND SOCCER AND YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY. SO SENATOR GLAZER IT I CAN. MAYBE HELPFUL HERE. WE'VE HEARD YOU SAY A COUPLE TIMES. THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT SOME CONCRETE ANSWERS. MAYBE YOU AND THE AUTHOR COULD SPEAK OFFLINE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE HAS IT RIGHT HERE. AND YOU CAN. YOU CAN MAYBE CHOOSE TO. LET THE BILL GO ON ITS CURRENT FORMER OR LAY OFF BUT I DON'T THINK THE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED. ASKING RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO BE RESOLVED RIGHT THIS MOMENT. OKAY THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH BUT IT'S A PART OF THE REASON THAT. IT ACT I TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VOTING FOR A BILL. I GREE AND I JUST THINK THAT WE'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT SEVERAL TIMES AND I JUST DON'T THINK WE CAN GET THAT ANSWER FOR YOU TODAY. I WILL GIVE ME AUTHOR THE CHANCE HE DOES WANT TO ANSWER FURTHER THAT'S NO PROBLEM. WELL I WOULD ALSO IF REMOTE HE WANTS TO. EXPAND UPON IF BRING. GREATER CLARITY TO YOUR QUESTION I WOULD. IOTA FROM YET DIEM RIGHT NOW. PLEASE FOR THE HAPPY TO ADDRESS YOUR LAST QUESTION. YOUR QUESTION FIRST FOR SACRAMENTO STATE WE BROKEN DOWN ALL THE NUMBERS IT WOULD COST ABOUT 3% OTHER TO LET ATHLETIC REVENUES SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY THREE IT'S ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND BUT THAT WOULD BE. SENATOR BRADFORD AND THIS COMMITTEE OR DECIDING WHERE THIS MONEY COME FROM A FOR SUSTAINING OTHER SPORTS. NEW REVENUE SO THERE'S NO NEW REVENUE THEN THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY- UNDER THE COUNTER TO WHAT THE CANADIANS ARE BRADFORD ARE DISCUSSING- TO PULL EXTRA MONEY SO- AND JUST TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE OUTSIDE OF THE RICHEST SCHOOLS OKAY THE SEVEN FBS FOOTBALL SCHOOLS. YOU HAVE A- LCS FOOTBALL GAME AND SCHOOLS WITHOUT ANY QUOTE ALL THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS THE REVENUE HAS TRIPLE TRIPLED IN SIZE AND YET THEY DECIDED TO DO. BE FIVE THOUSAND ADULT PREFERENCE OF THE NEEDS- THERE'S ALWAYS NEW REVENUE COMING IN FOR. YOU KNOW IF THE WEATHER THE RECESSION THEY STAY. AND COLD IT. THERE'S TO BE NEW REVENUE COMING IN AT ALL TO SO. THERE IS A WAY TO DO THAT WHICH SUSTAIN THE SPORTS- BY BEGINNING TO TAP INTO THIS INTO THE NEW REVENUE THAT'S GOING TO BE ULTIMATELY COMING. IN AT ONE LEVEL TO THE YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF THE SAN JOSE CITY WHICH HAS THE LEAST REVENUES OUT OF THE AT THE ESPYS AND- THEY JUST GAVE THEIR CODE. THANK A MILLION DOLLARS. ONE DOLLARS. YOU KNOW IN CONTRAST. YOU KNOW IF YOU JUST LOOK AT HOW MY WOULD COST TO FILTER BILL WOULD BE TO PAY EIGHT MILLION- INDIRECT BUT WHEN. IN PAY RAISE FOR THAT ONE COACH. IS OVER A THIRD OF AN EXAMPLE OF JUST TO KIND OF MAKE THINGS RIGHT- BUT- BILLS- YOU WITHIN A RANGE OF- COLLEGES THERE ARE STILL. PLENTY OF. NEW REVENUES THAT CAN BE TAPPED INTO FOR THIS BILL. OKAY AND THEN FOR THE FOR ME AT LEAST I THINK THAT. THAT THE HEART IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND I THINK WITHOUT HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE- THE SPONSOR JUST INDICATED THAT. THAT THEY NEED NEW REVENUE FOR SAC STATE TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL SO THAT SOME INDICATION THAT. THIS IS NOT GOING TO REALLY AFFECT SEX STATE SO WHAT IS IT REALLY DOING I THINK THAT THAT. ISN'T FOR ME TO TAKE A POSSIBLY. QUESTIONING IN AB HOPE THAT. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON TRYING TO GET THOSE ANSWERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER DOLLY. I TOO AM GONNA JUST TO. I HAD I HAD A SON BUSTER THAT WRESTLED IN D. ONE SCHOOL CAL POLY. PRESLEY- HARVARD WAS GONNA DO AWAY WITH THEIR WRESTLING PROGRAM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE MONEY AND THAT'S THE SPACE THAT YOU. I VOTED WITH YOU ON ALL THE LAST BILLS BECAUSE THIS IS A BUSINESS LET'S FACE IT IS A BUSINESS AS A BIG BUSINESS. AND ATHLETES ARE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BIG BUSINESS SO I I'M ONLY OFF I THINK YOU'RE ON THE YOUR MOVE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I'M GONNA BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IT DOESN'T AND IT DOESN'T JUST. BUT MORE OF A VISIT. JUST FOCUS ON THOSE TWO SPORTS TO REALLY MAKE MONEY. AT THE END OF THE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO. DIVERT AWAY FROM OTHER SPORTS AND I THINK- ON THE GENDER SIDE OF IT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE. MEN'S FOR PROBABLY OUT WAY IN THIS. IN THE MONEY MAKING DEPARTMENT. THAN THE WHIMS OR MAYBE NOT FOR THE- FOR THE- LAST BILLS WE DID WHERE THEY WERE BASICALLY.

REALLY THE GENESIS OF THIS FOR THOSE SCREWS ARE NOT GENERATING REVENUE THIS WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON WHATSOEVER IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME AS IT IS TODAY THE NUMBER OF COLLEGE ABOUT FLEETS TO. THE HOWEVER THE SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS IT'S FOR THOSE GENERATING REVENUE GENERATORS THAT. EXCEED THAT SCHOLARSHIP MONEY THAT WE ASK THAT IT BE EQUITABLY EQUITABLY. DISTRIBUTED AMONGST ATHLETES IN INCENTIVIZE GRADUATIONS AGAIN IF. YOU'RE IN A DIVISION TWO OR DIVISION THREE SCHOOL THAT'S NOT GENERATING REVENUE. WILL HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT.

MEMBERS SB FOURTEEN ZERO ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BUT FIRST AMEND AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. LEYVA HI LEYVA I WILL TROUBLED NOT VOTING GLAZER MCGUIRE MCGUIRE AYE PENCE WE WILL LEAVE THAT BILL ON CALL FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT SENATOR RUBIO IS UP NEXT WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY READY SAID IN A RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- TODAY I'M- HAPPY TO KEEP BEARD TO PRESENT TO UP MY BILL SB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE WHICH ADDS AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE TO THE GREAT SPAN ADJUSTMENT TO ENSURE MOST STUDENTS RECEIVE INDIVIDUALIZED ATTENTION AND INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR TEACHERS THIS BILL ENCOURAGES SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO REDUCE THE CLASS SIZE. AND BY ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING INCENTIVES AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS I CAN ATTEST FIRST HAND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MANAGE A REALLY LARGE CLASS SIZE IT TAKES THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM EACH CHILD WHO SOMETIMES NEEDS SO MUCH ATTENTION AND THEY DESERVE CALIFORNIA IS BEHIND THE NATION WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PER TEACHER. SOME CLASSES ARE OVER THIRTY STUDENTS AND YET CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENTS HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE EVERY CHILD IS DEFINITELY AND SMALLER CLASS SIZES ALLOW THE TEACHER TO GIVE THAT PERSONAL INSTRUCT PERSONALIZED INSTRUCTION TO STUDENTS TO INCREASE THEIR ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS MEMBERS I PERSONALLY KNOW BECAUSE I'VE HAD CLASSES OF OVER THIRTY STUDENTS ATTENTION FOR EACH STUDENT YOU CANNOT GIVE THEM THAT INDIVIDUAL ICE- ATTENTION LAST TIME TO TUTOR AND CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. BUT ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY LESS TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS AND CREATE THE NECESSARY PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS SUCCEED. AND STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN CALIFORNIA AS A CLASS SIZE REDUCTION PROGRAM PERFORM BETTER THAN STUDENTS REMAIN IN LARGER CLASSES ESPECIALLY AMONG LOWER INCOME AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. STUDIES ALSO SHOW THAT TEACHERS FEEL MORE POSITIVE AND THEIR ABILITY TO ASSESS AND MEET THE THEIR SPECIAL NEEDS I CAN SHARE FOR AGAIN FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TEACHING. THAT I HAD TWENTY STUDENTS THE AVERAGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY STUDENTS IN MY CLASS AND AFTER THE CRISIS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. MY CLASS WHO WENT UP TO UP TO THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS WHICH REALLY IMPACTED THE WAY I WAS ABLE TO INSTRUCT MY CLASS I DEDICATED PRIOR TO THE CRISIS I DEDICATED MOST OF MY TIME TO TUTORING BEFORE SCHOOL DURING RECESS LUNCH AFTER SCHOOL. THAT WAS ABLE TO REALLY CLOSE THE TREATMENT GAP SOMETIMES UP TO TWO GREAT LEVELS AFTER MY CLASS WENT UP TO THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR STUDENTS AND REALLY MY TIME WAS SPENT. GRADING MORE PAPERS SIDE. HOW TO SOME PLANS REALLY INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTIONAL INSTRUCTION FOR ABOUT THREE TO FOUR LEVELS THAT WE HAD IN OUR CLASSROOMS AND SO I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE TIME THAT TEACHERS FAMILIES STUDENTS IS CRITICAL THE ONE ON ONE TIME TO JUST SEE WHERE THEY'RE AT AND REALLY GIVE THAT PERSONAL TIME IS VITAL BUT AGAIN AFTER THE TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT CRISIS THAT PERSONAL TIME AND ABILITY FOR US TO- CLOSE THE TREATMENT GAP REALLY DID THAT INITIALLY. AND SO TODAY WE ARE HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW DO WE PRICES STATE SURPLUS LEAVE THAT THIS INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN IS CRITICAL AND I THINK THAT- THE FOUNDATION S. AS BUILDS FROM KEIICHI THROUGH THREE AND IF WE MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN LEAVE K. THROUGH THREE BOB WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION AND MAKES IT EASIER FOR THEM TO MOVE THROUGH THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND BE. OR LIKE. CAN ONLY HELP THE CHILDREN BUT IT ALSO HELPS THE TEACHERS THAT ARE STRUGGLING ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PANDEMIC WILL WITH SUCH. A LEARNING LOSS THAT WE'RE SEEING AND SO AGAIN RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO GREAT ADVANTAGES WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BILL NUMBER ONE IS THAT CLASS SIZE REDUCTION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED BEFORE. SO THERE IS A MODEL WE KNOW HOW. SECOND WE DO. BUDGET SURPLUS TOOK TO IT ACHIEVE THIS. SO FURTHERMORE I YOU KNOW I ALSO AM WORKING ON COMPLEMENTARY LEGISLATION THAT I KNOW- HAVE BEEN RAISED AS CONCERNS AND- AND THAT IS REMOVING BARRIERS FOR. OUR TEACHER CANDIDATES TO WANT TO COME INTO THE PROFESSION AND ALSO PRETTY WORKING ON ADDRESSING THE TEACHER SHORTAGE. BUT AT THE ACADEMIC OF PROGRESS AND SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO ESSAY REQUIRES TO FOR US TO DO THAT. THE WORK INTO IT TO GET IT DONE AND SO- NOT ONLY FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET OUR CHILDREN WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. SB EIGHT FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE JUST SIMPLY ADDS THE INCENTIVES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. SO THEY CAN RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT I REALLY WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY NOT MANDATORY. SO THAT THIS IS FOR- SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE THAT. THE ROOM CAPACITY THE TEACHER CAPACITY TO GET THIS DONE- ON THE- I MAY I WANTED TO DO MIGHT MEAN WE I AM MARK SAID IN A SPECIAL FROM A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I ALSO HAVE EDGAR CABRAL WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO OF MS MARTINEZ YOU ARE UP YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE- GOOD AFTERNOON. MISS CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANGELA MARTINEZ AND I'M A TEACHER EDUCATION SPECIALIST AT ABC UNIFIED SCHOOL EXPECTSTO FIND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE. I HAVE BEEN A TEACHER FOR SEVEN YEARS WORKING IN EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND THAT CAN HELP CRITICAL SMALLER CLASS SIZES ARE NEEDED TO HELP ADVANCE THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS. IT IS EXTREMELY DIVERSE. STUDENTS WITH DIFFERENT. WITH DIFFERENT ACADEMIC LEVELS IN OVERSIGHT CLASSROOMS. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ALL TO YOUR LESSON PLANS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF YOUR STUDENTS. I HAVE SEEN STUDENTS GET LOST IN THE SHUFFLE WITH OVERSIGHT CLASSROOMS STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO FADE INTO THE BACKGROUND AND DO NOT RECEIVE THE ATTENTION AND THE FOCUS THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED. THIS CAUSES LOW SELF ESTEEM AND STUDENTS AND IN MANY CASES STUDENTS AND GIVE UP BECAUSE THEY HAVE FALLEN BEHIND. AS A TEACHER I STRIVE TO MAKE SURE MY STUDENTS ARE. THE SUCCESSFUL BUT BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF STUDENTS IN MY CLASS LIST THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. THERE ARE SO MANY. MINUTES I HAVE TO READ EVERYTHING FOR EACH SUBJECT. ACCORDING TO PROVIDE ALL STUDENTS WITH AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN TO RECEIVE SPECIALIZED ATTENTION AND TO PROVIDE EVERYONE WITH THE SUPPORT THEY NEED. INTO THE STUDY IN THE JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT. STATES THAT ATTENDING SMALL CONCRETE AS THE PROBABILITY OF EARNING A COLLEGE DEGREE AND TEACHES STUDENTS TOWARD EARNING DEGREES AND HIGH EARNING FIELDS SUCH AS SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS. WE TEACHERS DO OUR BEST ALREADY NOW BUT IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN THERE IS A LIMITED TIME BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY STUDENTS WE NEED TO ATTEND TO. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL COMING UP. TEACHERS NEED TO BE COGNIZANT THAT PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH NOT JUST THE ACADEMIC SUPPORT BUT ALSO THE SOCIAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO ESTABLISH NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS AND HELP THEM SUCCEED LATER ON IN SCHOOL. SB FORTY THIRTY ONE WHAT DO THAT. IT WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO RECEIVE CRITICAL INDIVIDUALIZED ATTENTION AND INTERACTION WITH TEACHERS. I INTERRUPTED BY THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY TO LOWER THE STUDENT TO RATIO TEACHER TO TWENTY ONE AND K&lt;c.cyan&gt; THREE&lt;/c&gt; CLASSROOMS. SENATOR MENTIONED THIS BILL AS AN INCENTIVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND ADJUSTMENT OF THIRTY TWO POINT 5% OF THE BASE GROUND THEY MAINTAIN AN AVERAGE POSSIBLE MEANT OF LESS THAN TWENTY STUDENTS.

REQUIRE YOUR THREE VOTES WILL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR ABSENT THANK YOU CENTER OF. WELL I GUESS I CAN GO UP MEADOW VICE CHAIRMAN A HAND TO THE GAVEL. I'LL BRING IT TO YOU. THE. HI. WELCOME SENATOR LEYVA YOU MAY PRESENT BILLS YOUR BILL SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR ROACH HOBO GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM VICE CHAIR AND MEMBER I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGES FOUR AND FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE HELP TO IT SURE AND EVERY TEACHER CALIFORNIA HAS RETIREMENT SECURE. FIRES SEVEN SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL NEW EACH CREATE CHARTER SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM CALPERS AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM CALPERS. ACCORDING TO CAL STIRS 2240% OF NEWLY CREATED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OPTING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. BY NOT ALLOWING TEACHERS TO ACCESS THE DEFINED BENEFIT SYSTEM TEACHERS ARE LEFT WITH RETIREMENT OPTIONS THAT CAN DEPEND FAR TOO MUCH ON THE STOCK MARKET. EMPLOYEES AT CHARTER SCHOOLS WHICH ARE FUNDED BY PUBLIC. DESERVE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME RETIREMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS ALL OTHER EMPLOYEES ALL TEACHERS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY DECIDE TO TEACH AT. TEACHERS ALREADY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS THE CITY SHOULD NOT BE FURTHER HAMPERED FINANCIALLY EVEN MORE BY NOT HAVING ACCESS TO CAL STIRS IN CALPERS. SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE ALSO PUT SAFE IN PLACE POOR TARMAC PAYMENTS WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL FALLS BEHIND OR SHUTS ITS DOORS COMPLETELY. WHEN THIS HAPPENS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND WHICH PART IS CHARGED LOOK. HAS BEEN HARD TO PAY THE BILL. THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AN UNEXPECTED AND UNWARRANTED RETIREMENT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS SB FOURTEEN THIRTY. THIRTEEN FORTY THREE CORRECT THIS BY REQUIRING COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO WITHHOLD A REASONABLE PORTION OF A CHARTER SCHOOL FUNDING DISPLACEMENT AND PAY THE RENT. CATIONS SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE IS ABOUT PROVIDING ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SECURITY THAT THEY DESERVE TEACHERS GUIDE SUPPORT AND EDUCATE OUR NEXT GENERATION LEADERS THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS GIVE THEM ACCESS TO A SECURE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS TRISTEN BROWN CALIFORNIA CAN OF TEACHERS MEMBERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST I ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH S. LEYVA WE WILL NOW BEGIN WITH. DO IN PERSON HERE YOUR PERFECT PLEASE RECEIPTS ARE RECOMMENDED SHARE GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS STRESSING RENDON CFT YOUR SPONSORS OF THIS BILL- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS- REALLY DO SOME REPAIR WORK AND HOLD OUR RETIREMENT SECURITY SYSTEMS HARMLESS FROM SOME OF JUST THE- ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP CHARTER SCHOOL. BEING SOME AND SOME OUT OF THE STATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM- THE VAST MAJORITY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS TO PARTICIPATE AND STARS- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EDUCATORS KNOW WHEN TEACHER TO TRADITIONAL OR CHARTER SCHOOL THAT THEY ARE PUBLIC EDUCATORS AS WE ALL KNOW THEY WORK IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL WHICH BOTH CHARTERS AND TRADITIONAL DARK. AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE AND BE MEMBERS FOR THEIR- PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME OF THE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES FOR TEACHERS THEY DO NOT. AND TYERMAN IF YOU DO SPEND SOME TIME. IN YOUR TEACHING PROFESSION TEACHING AT A CHARTER SCHOOL WHO'S NOT A PARTICIPATING STORES TODAY. YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOSING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU OTHERWISE WOULD BE ACCRUING CREDIT IN YOUR SISTER'S- PENSION- OBLIGATION. AND SO WHAT WE WANNA DO IS LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD MAKE SURE THAT ALL PUBLIC EDUCATORS HAVE A SECURE PUBLIC RETIREMENT AS ANY TRADITIONAL SCHOOL TEACHER HAS. I AND OF COURSE FOR THE CLASSIFIED AS WELL THAT IF THEY ARE WORKING AT CHARTER SCHOOL THEY ARE STILL MEMBERS OF PURPOSE JUST AS THEY WOULD BE IN ANY OTHER TRADITIONAL SCHOOL. THIS IS REALLY ALSO IN REACTION TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN. LEAVING UNPAID BILLS THE SYSTEM IN WHICH WE THE TAXPAYERS THAN HALF BACK FILL IT PAY THOSE BILLS. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ARE WHERE THE BUCK STOPS FOR THESE SORT OF ISSUES. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS CREATE AN AUTOMATIC PAYMENT PROGRAM SO THAT WHEN A CHARTER IS- ESTABLISHED WE WILL BE MEMBERS OF THE SYSTEMS THEIR WORKERS WILL ACCRUE THEIR CREDIT. IF ANYTHING HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE AND THE SCHOOL HAS TO CLOSE BY THEIR ENROLLMENT HAS CHANGED OR THE FCUS IS CHANGED. THE PAYMENTS. AFTER AS THEY FLOW DOWN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ADD TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL COUNTY OFFICE WE'LL SEE WHAT THE PENSION OBLIGATION IS. AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCT THAT AMOUNT. EVERY PAYMENT AND SEND THE REST OF THE MONTH. IN HAVE TO MANAGE. TYERMAN PLANNED IN THIS INSTANCE IT IS ALL AUTOMATED FOR THEM AND THIS AGAIN IS ALL ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE SYSTEM AND THE RETIREMENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WORKING AT THOSE SCHOOLS. WE THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD COMMONSENSE MEASURE TO HELP PREVENT SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST. IT'S NOT A OF RAPID PROBLEM BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH SCHOOL SHUT DOWN LEAVING UNFUNDED LIABILITIES FOR THE REST OF US HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IN STORES LAST ANALYSIS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM HAVE NOTED. THAT EVERYONE ELSE. BECAUSE OF THE SLOW LEAK. OF CHARTER'S NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM SO. AGAIN IF YOU'RE PUBLIC EDUCATOR. YOU WORK IN A PUBLIC EDUCATION FACILITY. YOU ARE IN A PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEM. AND THERE'S NO. OTHER WOULD NEED TO COMPLICATE THE SYSTEM SO WITH THAT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE NO. BE HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

BUT EVEN WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WE NOW GO TO SCHOOL LIKE TIME COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO START UP IF WE COULD NOT HAVE LOCAL CHOICES ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT IN STUDENT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. OPTION EMPLOY WHICH- WOULD ELIMINATING THIS DISC FOR SCHOOL WILL IN THE FURTHER MANDATING AND- YOU TRUST GRAY THE COP THE OPERATION. AND THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OF EXISTING SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS BY TRYING. WE WERE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROGRAM WITH NEW SCHOOLS WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION. FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPERATING WITH THE OPTION TO PARTICIPATE IN STIRS AND CURSE WHILE BASS MAJORITY OF CHARTER SCHOOLS CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE PLANS. SOME OFFER ALTERNATIVE PLANS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. WE SEE NO COMPELLING REASON TO ELIMINATE PENSION OPTIONS LIKE PROGRAM THAT OUR EMPLOYEES. HAPPILY PARTICIPATED IN FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY SCHOOL FUNDING IS NEVER SUFFICIENT AND WE MUST CONSTANTLY BALANCE THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE. AND THOSE ONE PLEASE WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST.

CLARIFY AND I HEARD FROM OUR WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT EARLIER THAT THERE WAS SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY THEIR RETIREMENT DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE DETAILS ON ON THAT IN TERMS OF HOW MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT THAT HAVE. IN A REFER TO MY WITNESS. MR TRISTEN ARE. US SENATOR OF YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OCCURRENCES WITH THE ALLOW THE TRI VALLEY CHARTER SCHOOL FIASCO IN THE- TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS UNPAID- THERE IT'S HARD TO COLLECT QUANTITATIVE DATA UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY MANDATES TO SHARE IDEAS THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMSON THAT WHAT THEY CAN TELLS THAN WHEN SOMEONE IS ON THE BOOKS AND- THERE'S NO LONGER COME FOR THEM THEN THAT'S WHAT GO TO THE OFFICE. BUT WE- NUMBER LET'S SEE THIS MIGHT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOME FIGURED OUT ALSO HOW MANY PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THERE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY LAST I CHECKED I BELIEVE WERE AROUND TWELVE TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED OKAY AND I AM FROM THAT WITH THAT ONE CASE THAT WAS I DO. MORE FROM THERE THAN MOST MIGHT BE BUT YOU KNOW MOST OF THE TIME WHEN THAT THESE THINGS IMPLODE THERE'S A LOT OF NEWS ABOUT IT THAT JUST ABOUT WE'RE STIRS INFO. OF THE TWELVE OR THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHARTER SCHOOLS YOU TELL ME HOW MANY OVER THE LAST. TEN YEARS HAVE. BEEN CREATED A RETIREMENT CRISIS AS YOU DESCRIBED. I DON'T HAVE A HARD NUMBER FOR YOU BUT I CAN WORK WITH STORES TO TRY TO FIGURE THAT AND COME BACK TO IT OKAY NO I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE AD THAT BEGAN AT A CRISIS AND WE HAVE- WE HAD BAD LAWYERS WE HAVE BAD DOCTORS WE HAVE BAD LEGISLATORS DOESN'T MAKE SYSTEM ALL BOND SO. I THAT APPLE YOU GAVE IT. GOOD EXAM OF. YOU KNOW BEUST REAL ABUSE OF OUR PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS AT THAT MAKES ALL THIS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED- I GUESS IS I LOOK AT THIS BILL I THINK THAT IN SOME WAYS ARE KIND OF REAP FIGHTING AN EXISTING AGREEMENT THE- PATTERNS FOR HOW. PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS WERE TO CONDUCT THEMSELVES INCLUDING IN REGARD TO BUT THE RETIREMENT. CIRCUMSTANCES SOMETHING THAT. WERE VISITING IN THIS BILL AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT I. I SUPPORT- YOU KNOW A I WANT A ROBUST. THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR ALL OF OUR- SCHOOL TO. AND WHEREVER THEY ARE WHETHER IT'S IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH SCHOOL. THE BILL EITHER. PUBLIC THAT. THE METAL TAG WE'RE ALL. EIGHT GUARD THE SCHOOL. I CHARGE AT LEAST THAT THEY PER. AND ALTER EVERY BENEFIT AND THEY HAVE CHOICES AND THAT COULD BE SOCIAL SECURITY. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME ISSUES OF SOCIAL SECURITY BUT WE WON'T GET INTO THOSE HERE TODAY. AS WELL AS A- A FOUR OH ONE K. PROGRAM- AS WELL AS AS CASTERS SO IT SEEMS LIKE AND LESS THOSE ARE FLAWED SYSTEMS. THAT THOSE CHOICES ARE LEGITIMATE CHOICES HAPPENED- IT RAISES QUESTIONS AS TO WHY WOULD WE REVISIT THAT CHOICE YOUR DAY AND THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SEE ON THE RECORD. ABOUT THE REASON TO PUT IT OUT SEVEN ANECDOTE ABOUT OF A CHARTER SCHOOL FAILING IS THAT. SOMEHOW IT'S IT SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM. I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH CHARTER SCHOOLS GOING FORWARD BECAUSE AS YOU DON'T THINK WE AND OF CHARTER SCHOOLS OPEN. PRESS IT BUILD UP THIS WHICH THE SYSTEM FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION THAT TIRE IN DIG UP THE BIGGEST GROUP OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY TODAY ARE WOMEN OVER SIXTY FIVE MOST OF OUR TEACHERS IN ANY SCHOOL SETTING OUR LIMITS SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WOMEN AND TEACHERS OF UP TO HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT I WOULD SAY THAT I DON'T LOOK AT A FOUR ONE K. AS A GREAT RETIREMENT FROM THE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY AT THE- RECEIPT OF THE- MARKET. THE TO. PUT PENSION YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE EVERY SINGLE MONTH AND YOU CAN PLAN YOUR LIFE AROUND US SO FOR ME THIS IS A- BILL THAT IS ABOUT THE SECURITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING AND MAKING SURE WHEN THEY RETIRE. THEY CAN BE SECURE IN THE RETIREMENT. IT IS NOT GOING TO PROP UP CAL STIRS ARE CALPERS AT. THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A- IN THE IN HOUSE TO TALK ABOUT HOW. A NEW FOLKS COME IN THE SYSTEM WOULD PROVIDE GREATER CAPITAL THAT WOULD. IMPROVE THE THAT THE STABILITY IS CERTAINLY PUT MORE MONEY INTO SOMETHING IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO HELP BUT IT WILL NOT IT WOULD NOT PROP UP THE SYSTEM THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH MONEY. THERE WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH PEOPLE PROSPECTIVELY TO DO THAT. THINGS IT'S PRETTY COOL. THAT OUR ATTENTION SYSTEMS BOTH CALPERS AND CAL STIRS HAVE BEEN UNDER WATER FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND- AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO THE STOCK MARKET TO. IN TERMS OF THE GOING UP AND GOING IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY I WILL NOT A PENSION FUND FOR TWELVE YEARS AND- WHAT HOW THEY NEGOTIATE HOW AN INDIVIDUAL HAS A FOUR ONE K. VERY DIFFERENT OCEAN FRONT RIGHT DID RIGHT AND SO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MORE FLEXIBILITY- THEN OUR PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH THAT TYPE OF A CRISIS THAT IS CORRECT AND- BUT IN IN THE CASE OF OUR PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS- IF WE DON'T. AREN'T ABLE TO MEET. THE DEFAULT BENEFITS- YOU KNOW OUR OPTIONS ARE A LOT MORE LIMITED WE CAN'T GO TO. THE EMPLOYER ITS IT'S- IT ON US IN A PRIVATE PENSION PLAN. YOU CAN MAKE SOME CHOICES IN THAT SPACE AND I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE PROPERLY HAVE DONE THAT- BUT IT IT DIED. I GUESS FOR ME THIS IS A THIS IS A BILL THIS IS A THIS IS ROUTE RE FIGHTING SOMETHING THAT. I DON'T. KNOW THAT WE REALLY NEED TO RE FIGHT THERE'S NO CLEAR EVIDENCE ON THE RECORD THAT WE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM OUT THERE. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO OF. THAT THE BEAUTY OF THE PUBLIC CHARTER MOVEMENT IS TO BE GIVE GIVE THEM THANKS FOR THE IN CHOICE. I AM SURE THAT HOW THEY WANT TO DO THEIR THING. THEY'VE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL. THE NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HAS BEEN PUT ON THE RECORD IS. HAS BEEN GROWING FOR A LONG TIME AND PARENTS SEEM TO BE PRETTY PLEASED. THAT IT SHOULDN'T MATTER. CREATIVITY IN THOSE CHOICE. HIS ROOMMATE AND THEN THERE MAKING PARENTS. SELF I PUSHED. THE THOUGHT THE INTENTIONS OF THE AUTHOR I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT THIS BILL'S NOT LITIGATING WHETHER WE SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T HAVE. CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE. THE TEACHERS HAVE ACCESS TO A SECURE RETIREMENT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WE SHARE THOSE GOALS. I DON'T THINK MANDATING A ONE SOLUTION. THE PUBLIC CHARTERS IS THE ANSWER TO THAT- GOAL THAT YOU THE STATE YOU'VE IDENTIFIED AND I SHARE I SHARE WITH YOU. HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS. I'M I WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT SENATOR GLAZER WE SEEN THIS IN IN IN LABOR AT THE COMMITTEE AND SO FORTH AND I WENT HOME AND I WAS YOU KNOW LIKE I GO HOME IN THE EVENINGS AND I THINK ABOUT MY VOTED I THINK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE FURTHER TO TRY TO. SEE WHETHER OR NOT I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK OR NOT RIGHT TRACK OR WHAT WE COULD DO BETTER ON THAT I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO YOU KNOW CREATE GOOD POLICY I'M AND I WAS HOPEFULLY WE ALL ARE. ALSO THINKING ABOUT. M. THE CHOICE AND I THINK YOU KNOW I AM A- I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR INSTRUCTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS CONCEPTUALLY THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IT'S OUR DUTY TO DO THAT AND MAKING SURE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO DO THAT. THE CONCERN CARE- ARE BUT SENATOR LEISURE HAS ALSO HAS CONCERNS BUT ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE RETIREMENT IN THE CHOICES- ONE. OUR TEACHER. WILL TEACH HAVE OPTIONS AND CHOICES THROUGHOUT MAKING TEACH AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL THEY CAN. TEACH AT A CHARTER SCHOOL. ANALYZING HOW MUCH THE PAY WILL BE THE FLEXIBILITY THE SUBJECT MATTER HOW MANY STUDENTS- RETIREMENT BENEFITS THEY ALL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS FAR AS THE PACKAGES GO TO DECIDE THIS IS THE BEST A SITE OUT FOR ME OR THE BEST PACKAGE FOR ME SO THEY HAVE OPTIONS AND I THINK. AB WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOLS IN WILK AB REALLY SAID WITH MY FROM MY COLLEAGUE IS THAT HAVING OPTIONS AND CHOICES FOR OUR TEACHERS TO CHOOSE FROM WHAT BEST SUITS THEM I THINK THAT IS WHAT IS SO- IT'S VERY MUCH AN AMERICAN IDEAL TO HAVE CHOICE. FOR THE STATE LEADERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY THIS IS HOW OUR TEACHERS ARE GOING TO- CONTINUE OR ARE HAPPY THIS RETIREMENT- WITH THE- IN SECURITIES THAT WE MAY HAVE THERE IS NO SECURE SYSTEM IN IN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM BECAUSE AS- MY COLLEAGUE STATED. THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON ON ON THE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE INVESTMENTS CASTERS ANSWERS SO I. SO I AM. AYE AYE A- I WAS GRAPPLING WITH THIS BUT I BUT I WANNA JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT. CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THERE TO PROVIDE OPTIONS AND CHOICES THE STATE COMING IN AND TELLING THEM THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT. LIMITS THE CHOICES FOR BOTH pTHAT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW AND I PACKED UP ON THAT MATTER AND- SLEEVE THERE WAS ONE OTHER POINT THAT OUT TO MAKE- AND THAT'S WITH REGARDS TO- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THIS PAST YEAR SINCE BEEN ELECTED. IS THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE SOMETIMES EXCLUDED FROM CERTAIN FINDINGS- THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS- DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CHARTER SCHOOL THAT THEY HAVE SO THEY HAVE TO GRAPPLE. IN MY IN MY PERSPECTIVE THIS PAST YEAR- IS A LITTLE BIT OVER A YEAR THAT. THEY HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO PURSUE WITH REGARDS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS SO. BY LIMITING THEM AND HAVING CERTAIN PARAMETERS AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT FUNDING THEY CAN AND CANNOT RECEIVE UNLIKE OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THEN TO COME IN AND SAID THIS IS THE- THIS IS YOUR PATH. TO WITH THEIR RETIREMENT SYSTEMS YOU YOU YOU HAVE TO TAKE I THINK IT'S A BIT UNFAIR. TO OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS AND- THAT'S THE LAWSUIT HI. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY A BIG THANK YOU SENATOR TOBER WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARN WHAT IT DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION WHAT THIS PAST YEAR OKAY SO HOW OLD WERE YOU THIS PAST YEAR AFTER MY DEATH. NOT AT ALL FORTY NINE FORTY NINE SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FORTY EIGHT OKAY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT TEACHERS COMING IN AND HAVING THESE CHOICES AND HAVING A MENU OF. MAKING THAT DECISION OF WHAT THEY WANT TO DO- IF YOU JUST LEARNED ABOUT WHAT IT FIND BENEFIT PENSION BUYS AT FORTY NINE YEARS OLD IF I'M GRADUATING. FROM COLLEGE AND I'M GONNA BE TEACHING AND I'M TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD I PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AS- IS REALLY BY CHOICE THERE FOR MAYBE I DON'T KNOW HOW. MANY PEOPLE ARE VERY ENAMORED WITH FOR ONE CASE WHEN I WAS IN THE- WHEN I REMEMBER ONE OF. MY MEN PERCENT IS RE. FOR MERVYN'S AND SHE HAS A THOUSAND. FOUR ONE K. WHY DON'T I HAVE THAT. I SAID BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION THAT MEANS YOU WILL COLLECT. THE SAME AMOUNT WHATEVER DOES DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF YEARS YOU WORKED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. WHEN YOU HAVE A FOUR ONE K. THEORETICALLY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIVE OFF THE INTEREST OF THAT. SO LET'S SAY THAT YOU CAN GET A 10% RETURN WHICH IS UNHEARD OF NO ONE'S GOING TO GET A 10% RETURN. ON THEIR INVESTMENT THAT WOULD MEAN YOU TO. TEN THOUSAND. A YEAR IF YOU. HAVE ON THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE YOU FOUND THAT 10% RETURN. THAT YOU WEREN'T PULLING AWAY AT YOUR NEST EGG AND IT'S GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER EVERY YEAR. SO MY POINT IS YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT DEFINED BENEFIT WAS INTO YOUR- A LITTLE BIT OLDER IN LIFE. WE'RE ASKING YOU'RE A THREE YEAR FOR EXAMPLE WERE TELLING THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE A DECISION MAKE A CHOICE. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CHOOSING SO MANY OF US WANT TO HELP THEM. TO MAKE A CHOICE THAT WILL HELP THEM IN SECURE TO BE SECURE IN THEIR RETIREMENT. BUT YOU'RE SO CENTER GLAZE I THINK WE JUST HAVE SOME. FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES AND AGAIN. THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE. PEOPLE CAN RETIREMENT RETIRE. AND BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS WHEN I TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE- I WAS SAID TO THEM. WHO KNOWS WHAT RETIREMENT IS WHO KNOWS WHAT IT IS TO HAVE A PENSION. MOST OF THEM DON'T KNOW. WHAT I TELL THEM IS WHEN YOU RETIRE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO EAT. SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A JOB. THAT HAS A PENSION. MAKING SURE. TEACHERS WHO ARE TEACHING OUR FUTURE LEADERS HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THAT IS A LAUDABLE GOAL AND SOMETHING EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. SHOULD BE PASSIONATE ABOUT BECAUSE- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T PAY THEIR BILLS WHEN THEY'RE OLDER. THAN THEY GO ON THE END UP ON THE STREETS OR THE END UP LIVING WITH FAMILY. IT'S ABOUT DIGNITY IT'S ABOUT RESPECT IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND RETIREMENT AFTER THEY'VE WORKED. FOR AND- CLASS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY NOUN IT'S APPROPRIATE I WAS GOING TO BE QUIET AND JUST VOTE NO BUT I WANTED I FEEL I'M SOMEBODY WHO'S ABOUT DEFINED BENEFITS. AND BECAUSE I SERVED ON THE CALIBER SERVERS WE HAD AN UPSIDE DOWN DEFINIT AT WHICH WOULD PRE BOARDS ALREADY SET SO I JUST WANT TO FOR THE RECORD. THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOW THAT IF YOU ARE IN PERSON. FIRSTERS YOU HAVE A DEFINED BENEFIT. IT IS BASED OFF OF THE STOCK MARKET AND WHO'S THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR IS THE STATE OR SCHOOL BOARD OR ARE IN SCHOOL OR- LOCAL DISTRICT AND IT IS ALL BASED OFF OF. IF THAT DEFINED BENEFIT GOES UPSIDE DOWN ON THE INVESTMENTS. THE TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK FOR THE UTILITY DISTRICT OR WHOEVER THIS IS ON THE HOOK SO. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. YOU'RE GETTING A DEFINED BENEFIT ONLY IF THERE'S A BENEFIT THERE TO BE HAPPY. AND IN PERSON. NOT STIRS THAT PERSON IS VERY UPSIDE DOWN RIGHT NOW AND A LOT AND THEN THE OTHER WE ALL OVER THE STATE BECAUSE EVERY YOU KNOW EVERY- MUNICIPALITY HAS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM SO. TRUST ME WHEN THE STOCK MARKET TAKES A DIP IN IT WILL WE WILL BE TALKING. THOSE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN NAY AND THOSE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE IT BECAUSE IN MY DISTRICT WAS THE FIRST COMMUNITY THAT WE SAW. A RETIRED WOMAN WHO HAD A DEFINED BENEFIT AND SHE WAS GETTING SET FOR. SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND WENT TO NINETEEN BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BASED OFF OF WHAT'S IN THE FUND. AND SO. REMIND YOU. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT BUT IT IS TIED TO THE STOCK MARKET AND THE COMPANY WORK FOR IS THE STATE OR THE CITY OR COUNTY WHATEVER IT IS. AND THEY'RE ON THE HOOK FOR AND THAT'S A TAXPAYER. AND SERVED ALL I AGREE WITH YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. CALPERS AND SING IN THE STOCK MARKET IS IT'S AMORTIZED OVER A MUCH LONGER TIME AND OVER MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MORE. THE FOUR OH ONE K. SO ARE THEY BOTH DEPEND ON THE STOCK MARKET YES THEY ARE BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS ONE IS MUCH BIGGER AND CAN TAKE LOSSES. CAN TAKE KIDS. IF I HAD A FOUR ONE K. AND THERE'S A HUGE HIT MY LOSE HALF OF MY FOUR ONE K. I MAY NOT MAKE THAT. UP IN TIME FOR WHEN I RETIRE. THAT'S STILL A CHOICE THAT SOMEBODY CAN MAKE. LIFE IS FULL OF CHOICES THAT ARE OCHO I AGREE. I AGREE I AGREE I JUST THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVE CHOICES AND THEY CAN DECIDE AND BE EDUCATED ON THE SYSTEM LET'S HOPE FOR EDUCATING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT IT Y. A. R. I. DON'T THINK WE ARE. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE- THANK YOU SO MUCH AT O WE HAVE YOUR CLOSING THAT IS MY CLOSING OKAY.
