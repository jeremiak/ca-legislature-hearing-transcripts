AS IT MOVES TOWARD IS THERE A

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:51.361

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.345
ORGANIZED- AROUND SORT OF A FEW

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.582
MAIN SECTIONS THE FIRST IS OUR

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.083
CONSERVATION FRAMEWORK- WITH

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.785
THREE KEY OBJECT FOR ACHIEVING

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.887
THIRTY BY THIRTY. FIRST PROTECT

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:53.923
BIODIVERSITY THIS IS REALLY A

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.758
CROWDED IN THE INTERNATIONAL

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:57.126
MOVEMENT FOR THIRTY BY THIRTY

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.494
IT'S REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.796
MAKING SURE THAT. THE PLANTS AND

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.765
ANIMALS THAT WE RELY ON FOR OUR

01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:05.901
ECOSYSTEM SERVICES- ARE. ARE

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:08.270
EGGS CAN PERSIST ACROSS THE

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.539
GLOBE. WE'VE COURSE ALSO KNOW

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:14.743
pCAN EXPAND. TO NATURE AND

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:15.811
PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.413
PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE OF THE

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.882
OUTDOORS. AND OUR LANDS CAN BE

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.750
USED TO MEDICATE- OF SEQUESTER

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.786
CARBON AND BUILD RESILIENCE TO

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.254
THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:28.524
THESE ARE THREE KEY OBJECTIVES.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:29.758
WE ALSO THREE CORE COMMITMENTS

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.193
THAT REALLY SHOULD GOVERN

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:33.228
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO- AS WE

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.564
IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGY WE WANT

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.832
TO WORK TO ADVANCE JUSTICE

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.602
EQUITY DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.

01:10:39.668 --> 01:10:41.503
ALWAYS TO STRENGTHEN OUR TRIBAL

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.206
PARTNERSHIPS. AND IN THE CONTEXT

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:45.541
OF DURING OUR CONSERVATION

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.576
PROTECT OUR ACADEMIC PROSPERITY

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.745
OUR CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES AND

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:53.816
OUR FOOD SUPPLY. WE PUT FORWARD

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.985
A DEFINITION FOR WHAT OUR THIRTY

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.653
BY THIRTY CONSERVATION AREAS SO

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.521
HOW WE WILL COUNT TO THIRTY WE

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.090
HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT WE'RE

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:03.525
COUNTING. SO THIS IS THE

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:04.727
DEFINITION WE PUT OUT IN OUR

01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:05.961
DRAFT LAND AND COASTAL WATER

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:08.497
AREAS THAT ARE DURABLY PROTECTED

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.331
AND MANAGED TO SUPPORT

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.934
FUNCTIONAL ECOSYSTEMS BOTH

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.736
INTACT AND RESTORED AND THE

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.537
SPECIES THAT RELY ON THEM. SO

01:11:15.604 --> 01:11:16.905
REALLY TWO PIECES OF OUR

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:19.408
DEFINITION THE PLACE SHOULD BE

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:21.377
PROTECTED FOR- FUNCTIONAL

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:24.647
ECOSYSTEMS FOR BIODIVERSITY AND

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:25.648
THAT PROTECTION SHOULD BE

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:29.652
DURABLE. WHEN IT COMES TO LANDS

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:32.121
ARE 24% OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:34.189
MEETS THAT DEFINITION AND THIS

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:36.191
REALLY SHOWS UP ACROSS A BROAD

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.460
RANGE OF USES AND LANDSCAPES

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.329
THIS INCLUDES DEDICATED

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.764
CONSERVATION AREAS. RECREATIONAL

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:44.333
LANDS AND OPEN SPACES AND A FAIR

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.268
NUMBER ARE WORKING LANDS THAT

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:48.404
ARE UNDER CONSERVE EASEMENT FOR

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.471
CONSERVATION VALUES BUT CONTINUE

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:53.175
TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW GRAZING OR

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:56.912
OR- TIMBER IT A SUSTAINABLE WAY

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.548
. WE ALSO AND- IN EVERYTHING

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.949
ABOUT THESE LANDS THE IMPORTANCE

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:02.718
OF ALL CONSERVATION TO THE

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:04.620
FUNCTIONING OF THESE SORT OF

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.922
SPECIAL CONSERVATION AREAS AND

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.257
THAT THEY EXIST IN A BROADER

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:11.126
MATRIX OF- CONSERVATION EFFORTS

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.262
THAT ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT. I'M

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:15.297
GONNA TURN THE SCREEN OVER TO

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:16.632
MARK GOAL HE'S GONNA TALK LITTLE

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:18.701
BIT ABOUT- FROM THE PLAYS OUT IN

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:22.104
OUR COASTAL WATERS MARK. DR

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:24.306
NORRIS ON. ON THE CONSERVATION

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.508
OF COASTAL WATERS- YEAH BUT A

01:12:26.575 --> 01:12:28.010
FEW THINGS SORT OF WORKING AT

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.978
THE SAME TIME ON. WE HAVE MARINE

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.914
PROTECTED AREAS WHICH ACCOUNT

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.750
FOR ABOUT 16% OF COASTAL WATERS

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:39.221
ON YOUR OPTIC CALIFORNIA. OUR

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.322
NETWORK OF MARINE PROTECTED

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:41.957
AREAS THAT TWENTY FOUR MPAS. ON

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.960
IS A NETWORK IT'S REALLY SAD AND

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:48.063
- GLOBALLY AND NOT FIRST. WHERE

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.065
IN THE MIDST OF A DECADE- REVIEW

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.000
OF THAT NETWORK AND SO WE HAVE

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.902
WE HAVE PROMISED. STAKEHOLDERS

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.972
ON ALL SIDES THAT- WE WON'T MAKE

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.341
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON MODIFYING

01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:02.478
THE MPA NETWORK ON INTEL THE

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.546
CATTLE REVIEW IS. WHICH WILL BE-

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:07.216
ON THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:09.818
YEAR. I'M AND THEN WHAT'S HAVING

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:13.222
. ABOUT EMPTY- AND WHETHER THERE

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:15.324
SHOULD BE A MODIFICATION OR NOT-

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.092
ON THAT. TURNING YOUR CALL I

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:18.961
THINK OKAY SO WHAT DO GET

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.963
ADDITIONAL- FOURTEEN AND JUST AS

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.798
A REMINDER TO EVERYBODY. MPAS

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:25.300
ARE NOT ALL NO TAKE ON AREAS I

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:26.902
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:28.670
FOR EVERYONE TO KNOW. ON A LOT

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:30.939
OF THEM ARE ARE CON. FOCUSED ON

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.241
WHICH WOULD ALLOW SOME

01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:36.278
COMMERCIAL TAKE. OR MARC.

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.413
RECREATIONAL TAKE THE ON WHICH

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.049
M. P. EIGHT S. AND SO ON THAT

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:44.753
THAT FROM 9% ARE NO TAKE AND 7%

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.955
ARE ON. OUR CONSERVATION BASED

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:53.629
JUSTICE FOR BACK PROPERTY. BODY

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:55.464
SO I'M GETTING A THIRD- WHAT WE

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:56.832
TALKED IS THE- OF REALLY. OUR

01:13:56.899 --> 01:14:00.469
WERE TO- WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:03.238
THE AND I NORA- OBVIOUS- THE BY

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.907
MINISTRATION HIS MAY US. SO OF

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.942
PLAN. ON THIRTY THIRTY ARMS WE

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:07.776
HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY WORKING

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:10.345
WITH THEM ON ASPEN SANCTUARIES.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.981
FIVE NAZARIAN REYES ARE LED ON

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.183
BY NOW WHAT IN THE FEDERAL

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:16.285
GOVERNMENT- THEY MAKE UP.

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:17.753
CURRENTLY MORE THAN 40% OF OUR

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.589
COASTAL WATERS AWAY OVER THIRTY.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.624
FIVE ENDS AND I YOU HAVE A

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.993
STAKEHOLDER- BASED MANAGEMENT

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.929
ARRANGEMENT WHERE THE STATE IS

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:27.863
VERY HEAVILY INVOLVED ALL

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.164
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS ARE INVOLVED

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.532
BUT IT'S FISHING COMMUNITY

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:31.533
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY BUSINESS

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.837
INSIDER. ON OUR ARE PART OF THIS

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:35.404
NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:38.240
EFFORT IT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.675
ABOUT ON POTENTIAL MOVING

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.845
FORWARD IN THIS PATHWAY DOT. ON

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.980
TO- WOULD TO DO AND- SANK

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:45.647
DISTRICT STRENGTHENING

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:47.216
CONSERVATION BETTER MEET THE

01:14:47.282 --> 01:14:48.884
DEFINITION THE DOCTOR NORTH

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:50.953
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND THOSE

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.454
WOULD INCLUDE- THINGS TO

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:54.156
CONSIDER WOULD BE STRENGTHENING

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.891
OUR QUALITY AND INVASIVE

01:14:55.958 --> 01:14:57.693
SPECIES- PROTECTION AND SEED

01:14:57.759 --> 01:15:00.796
BASSIL REDUCTION. ON PROTECT-

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:03.465
MARINE MAMMALS ON ENHANCE

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:05.701
DURABILITY OF EXISTING CON.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:08.937
BASED FISHERIES MAN APPROACHES.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:11.473
WATSON OR TO MATCH APPROACH IS

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.641
LIKE WITH DIFFERENT THIS CALL.

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:15.911
AND THE RAMP ON THOSE ARE SOME.

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.646
OF WHAT WE COULD BE DEALING

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.315
ANNOUNCEMENTS REYES SO NONE OF

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:21.316
THAT BEEN DETERMINED I'M REALLY

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:24.319
EXCITED ABOUT- WERE WITH- SAY.

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:25.954
AND THEN MEANS THANKS FOR MOVING

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.789
FORWARD ON DOING THAT I'M SEE

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.391
THERE'S THAT YOU MUST. REPUBLIC

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:32.127
JIM HERITAGE. THANKS REYES WELL.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:34.263
ON IN WHICH LOTS OF

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:36.765
OPPORTUNITIES- TO REALLY DEVELOP

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:45.774
FURTHER WITHOUT BACK TO DR.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:48.911
NORTH THANKS MARC. SO ARE MARK

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:52.281
MEANT THAT WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:53.548
HAD ABOUT HOW A MILLION OF ONE

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:56.318
TO- GET TO THIRTY PER AND ABOUT

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:57.519
TO MILLION OF LAND AND HE I

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.187
DON'T SOME OF THE WAYS WE MIGHT

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.289
DO IN COASTAL WATERS IN OUR

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:02.024
PATHWAY DOCUMENT WE I. AS OF

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:03.158
PATHWAY TO THIRTY BY THIRTY I'M

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:05.093
GONNA TOUCH ON THESE HERE HERE

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.662
HERE ANY MENTION OF SOME OF WHAT

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.430
WE'RE THINKING OF IN THE COASTAL

01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:10.565
WHY. SO FUNDAMENTAL WHY OF EXCEL

01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:13.535
RE LAY CONS WE REALLY FOR ARE

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.971
ARE LOCAL PARTNER NO BEST WHERE

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:17.172
. CAN HAPPEN THEY'VE DONE THE

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.341
HARD WORK OF IDENTIFYING

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:21.710
IMPORTANT AREAS FOR COMMUNITIES

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:24.313
SO ONE OF EXELA BACK CONSERVE-

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:26.548
EXIT STRATEGICALLY ACQUISITIONS

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:29.418
BY ADDITIONAL TO ACQUIRE WE WANT

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.086
TO INCREASE BOB CONSERVATION

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:33.121
EASEMENTS ENHANCE CONSERVATION

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:34.690
OF EXISTING PUBLIC LANDS AND

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:36.325
WATERS AS MARK WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:16:36.391 --> 01:16:37.993
OF COURSE WE HAVE LOTS OF

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.161
OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL WITHIN OUR

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.196
FEDERAL OTHER FEDERAL LANDS LIKE

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:42.931
FORESTS OF THE FISH AND WILDLIFE

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:45.467
SERVICE IT'S ULTRA WE WANT TO

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:45.968
INSTITUTIONALIZE ADVANCE

01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:47.736
MEDICATION WE THINK THIS IS A

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:48.737
REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.839
ADVANCE CONSERVATION BY- MORE

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:54.676
STRATEGICALLY- USING MEDICATION

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:55.410
ACROSS OUR LANDSCAPE

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.611
PARTICULARLY FOR LARGE

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.680
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- PLACING

01:16:58.747 --> 01:16:59.715
THAT MITIGATION IN PLACES THAT

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:03.618
WE MOST NEED IT AND IN IN WAYS

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:04.753
THAT ARE MORE STRATEGIC. ONE OF

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.221
AND EXCEL IN BAR RESTORATION WE

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.689
CAN'T JUST PROTECT OUR WAY OUT

01:17:07.756 --> 01:17:08.991
OF THE BIODIVERSITY CRISIS WE

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:11.293
NEED TO RESTORE- IMPORTANT

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.229
LANDSCAPES- WE WANT TO

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:14.930
STRENGTHEN OUR COORDINATION

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:15.964
AMONG GOVERNMENTS AND KEY

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:17.699

MORE CONSERVATION MAYBE BY-

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.252
CONNECTING TO OTHER EXISTING

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.188
PLACES ARE BUILDING WILDLIFE.

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:49.691
FOR EXAMPLE WE PROVIDE- OVERLAYS

MAKE SURE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:26.127
OF. THAT I GOALS PROPORTIONALLY

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.730
ACHIEVE STATEWIDE SO THAT I SAW

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:30.665
ON ON THE STATE MY MAP THE HEAD

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:31.833
OVER THERE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:33.001
EXISTING NATIONAL PARKS AND

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.936
STATE PARKS AND OTHER CONSERVE

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.304
LANDS THAT'S GREAT THAT WE'VE

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.772
DONE THAT TO DEAN- BUT- THAT WE

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:41.309
DON'T. GET TO A STATEWIDE- GOAL

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.445
THAT SOMEHOW CONCENTRATES THAT-

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:44.846
IN IN CERTAIN AREAS THAT WERE

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.381
REALLY MAKING SURE THROUGH THAT

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.515
REGIONAL PARTICIPATION THAT WE

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.317
ARE ACHIEVING THAT BECAUSE WE

01:24:49.384 --> 01:24:50.985
HAVE A LOT OF INTEREST THERE I'M

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:52.520
WONDERING- FOR SOME OF OUR

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.823
LOCAL- CONSERVE LANES DEDICATED

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:57.292
LANDS I MEAN C. P. TERRITORY IS

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:57.992
THAT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:24:58.059 --> 01:25:03.264
FILTER. THE SORT OF- THE- THE

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.899
ACHIEVEMENT OR OR THE FOR THE

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:10.472
REGISTERING OF. OF WHETHER NOT

YOU KNOW I SEE THOSE KIND OF THE

01:25:20.715 --> 01:25:21.983
GOLD STANDARD FOR IDENTIFYING

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.485
WHERE WE SHOULD DO CONSERVATION

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:24.552
NEXT AND COMMUNITY DRIVEN

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.321
CONSERVATION. OF COURSE THERE'S

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:28.022
LOTS OF OTHER STRATEGIES THAT

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:29.290
GET US TO THE AND SIMILAR KINDS

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:31.793
OF PRIORITIES- BUT WE DO

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.927
IDENTIFY IN THE PATHWAYS

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.829
DOCUMENT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.898

SOVEREIGN NATION TERRITORY

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:01.616
WITHOUT ALSO COUNT. TOWARD OUR

CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.556
ABOUT HOW TO U. K. AS A GENERAL.

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:12.193

COUNT THEIR LANDS SO I THINK

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.077
CONCEPTUALLY OF COURSE THEY

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:31.980

SO WE'RE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:39.087

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:41.623
CONVERSATION TO HAVE BUT I THINK

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:42.190

OBVIOUS FROM ALL THE

01:27:53.534 --> 01:27:54.402
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD IS

01:27:54.469 --> 01:27:55.870
THAT THERE ARE SOME. DEEP ARE

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.906

A COUPLE WAYS AND ALL OF THE

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:19.947
LOSE THE FRIEND- FIRST YOU KNOW

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:20.782
WE'RE NOT DISCOUNTING THE

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:23.551
IMPORTANCE OF ALL OF THE-

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:24.485
FEDERAL AND STATE LAND THAT IS

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:26.687
ALREADY. LARGELY YOU KNOW

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:27.789
MANAGEMENT HELD BY GOVERNMENTS

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.190
BUT MANY OF THOSE ARE MULTIPLE

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.526
USE LANDS AND THEY'RE NOT

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:32.059
PRIMARILY PROTECTING OUR

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.828
BIODIVERSITY AND WHAT THIRTY BY

01:30:33.895 --> 01:30:36.531
THIRTY IS TRYING TO DO IS TO TRY

01:30:36.597 --> 01:30:39.567
TO MOVE BEYOND- SOME OF THAT.

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:40.701
SOME OF THAT MANAGEMENT MAKE

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:42.203
SURE THAT WE'VE GOT THIS

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.137
PROTECTED PLACES THAT CONSERVE

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:44.672
OUR BRAND DIVERSITY AT

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:45.873
FUNDAMENTAL IT DOESN'T SAY THAT

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.808
THAT OTHER CONSERVATION IS AN

01:30:46.874 --> 01:30:49.644
IMPORTANT IN FACT IF I GO BACK

01:30:49.710 --> 01:30:50.478
TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS. THE

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:52.180
MAJOR IN WHICH THE CAN AREAS

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:53.748
EXIST IS VERY IMPORTANT AND HOW

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:55.650
THEY ARE MANAGED IS INCREDIBLY

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:58.452
HIGH VALUE. SO THAT'S ONE. WHEN

01:30:58.519 --> 01:31:00.054
IT COMES TO THE MAPS- ONE THING

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:03.491
WE LEARNED SO WE USED- TO

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.560
EXISTING DATASETS TO BEGIN OUR

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:06.828
MAPPING EFFORT NICE IT BEGAN

01:31:06.894 --> 01:31:08.095
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL WORK TO

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:09.831
BE DONE TO REFINE THESE MAPS

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.966
BUT- WE RELIED ON THE U. S.

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:13.501
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THEY DID A

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:16.470
NATIONWIDE EVALUATION OF ALL. OF

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:18.539
PUBLICLY OWNED LAND FROM

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:21.509
WILDERNESS AREAS TO- BOAT RAMPS

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:23.678
AND CLASSIFIED THEM ACCORDING TO

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.880
THEIR LEVEL OF PROTECTION. SO

01:31:25.947 --> 01:31:28.649
THESE FOR GAP CODES ONE TWO

01:31:28.716 --> 01:31:30.051
THREE FOUR. AND WE SAID THAT WE

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:32.620
WOULD LIKE TO WE THINK CODE ONE

01:31:32.687 --> 01:31:34.856
AND LARGELY MEET OUR DEATH.

01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:36.824
HELLO HAS AN AN- DATA SAID

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:38.459
CALLED TE PROTECTIVE AIR

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:39.093
CALIFORNIA PROTECTED AREAS

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.896
DATABASE SO IT STEPS DOWN FROM

01:31:41.963 --> 01:31:44.098
THIS USGS CLASSIFICATION. AND

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:47.001
THAT- MAPS ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:48.402
OPEN SPACES ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:50.004
AND WHAT WE FOUND WHEN WE PUT

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.739
THOSE MAPS OUT DURING OUR DRAFT

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:53.808
IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF PLACES THAT

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.209
WE THINK SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.445
GAP ONE AND TWO. FOR ONE REASON

01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:58.746
OR ANOTHER ARE NOT FOUND ON OUR

01:31:58.813 --> 01:32:00.615
MAPS. MOST NOTABLY ARE PLACES

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:01.549
LIKE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.951
WERE- PRIVATE LANDOWNERS HAVE

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:05.186
PUT THEIR LAND UNDER EASEMENT

01:32:05.253 --> 01:32:06.888
FOR THE PURPOSES OF CONSERVATION

01:32:06.954 --> 01:32:08.256
I'M THINKING ABOUT GRAZING LANDS

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:09.991
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THAT ARE

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:11.792
REALLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:12.927
PROTECTING OUR VERNAL POOL

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:14.795
ECOSYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE. THOSE

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.764
DON'T SHOW UP ON OUR MAPS ONE

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:17.999
REASON OR ANOTHER MY GUESS IS.

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:19.867
THAT EASEMENTS ARE ON PAPER AND

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:21.135
THEY'RE IN SOMEBODY'S FILE

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.104
DRAWER SO WE'RE ACTUALLY USING

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:25.473
THIS PROCESS TO- GET THOSE

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.708
PLACES ON OUR MAPS. I NEED TO GO

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:30.077
BACK AND LOOK AT YOUR SOMEBODY

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.245
BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:33.014
SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE SO IF YOU

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.282
SOMEBODY. IT'S THAT I DIDN'T

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:36.784
KNOW SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.653
LOOK AND FIGURE THAT OUT BUT IT

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:39.620
SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED.

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:40.788
YEAH I WOULD JUST FOR THE

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:42.390
COMMITTEE. WHAT WE'RE HEARING

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:43.491
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TWENTY

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:45.693
FOUR- MILLION ACRES ROUGHLY R.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.828
24% OF. ITS WHAT'S THE PROJECTED

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:50.331
WE WANT TO GET THE THIRTY AND SO

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.166
GIVEN THAT SAID IT'S JUST.

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.868
IRONIC THAT A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:54.969
THAT WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN INTO

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:57.104
ACCOUNT AND PRESERVE SUCH AS

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:59.707
EASEMENTS SUCH AS WHEN HIS NAP

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.142
PROGRAMS. NOW YOU HAVE MULTIPLE

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:02.009
KINDS OF DIFFERENT EASEMENT

01:33:02.076 --> 01:33:06.213
PLATFORMS BUT THOSE ARE BEING

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.416
COUNTED. AND WHEN I'M JUST

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:09.684
SITTING TELLING YOU IS WE WORK.

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:11.585
THAT NUMBER. BY A 100% OF WHAT

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.654
THEIR PROJECTING AND WHAT THEY'D

01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:16.157
LIKE TO ACHIEVE. I'M JUST

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:17.058
CURIOUS ABOUT THE INFORMATION

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.659
WE'RE RECEIVING. AND THE

01:33:18.726 --> 01:33:20.461
GENUINENESS NOT THE JUST BAJOR

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:22.863
BURIED YOU OR ANYONE THAT'S

01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:24.665
WORKED HARD AT THIS. PETER FACT

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.701
THAT YOU CAN JUST GOOGLE AND YOU

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:29.537
CAN LOOK UP RIGHT NOW. AND I

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:31.038
THINK IT'S UNFAIR OF US TO NOT

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:31.772
TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.641
CONSIDERATION ESPECIALLY SINCE

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:34.342
THE BIO DIVERSITY IS AN

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:36.177
IMPORTANT THING. AND WE FORGET

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.878
THOSE COASTAL AREAS THAT ARE

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.113
ACTUALLY UNDER WATER THAT ARE

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.215
PROTECTED AS WELL NOT CALCULATED

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:43.351
OR FORMULATED INTO THE

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:45.720
PRESENTATION. IT'S REALLY HARD

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:47.488
FOR US FOR SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:50.124
TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THIS. SO I

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:52.526
APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:53.995
MEDICARE I KNOW MISS GARCIA HAD

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:57.498
ANOTHER QUESTION. THE AD THEY

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:58.499
GIVE US REGULAR MISTER BENNETT'S

01:33:58.566 --> 01:33:59.867
NEXT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO ASK

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.269
OUR THOUGHT HE- YES WITH IT JUST

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:02.837
STIMULATE. A LITTLE BIT OF

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:05.606
RESPONSIBLE I BELIEVE THAT ALL

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:07.341
THE RIPARIAN SANCTUARY AREAS ARE

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:10.411
INCLUDED AND I. AT AND CAN WE

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:12.480
GET A CONFIRMATION OF THE RAIN

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:14.148
CHECK SURE AREAS INCLUDED. IN

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:15.349
THE THIRTY BY THIRTY I BELIEVE

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:19.086
THEY ARE. WELL MASKING NOW THE-

01:34:19.153 --> 01:34:22.757
GOLF. HE YEAH SO ON I THANK YOU

01:34:22.823 --> 01:34:24.959
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENEFIT QUESTION

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:28.362
ON. THEY ARE NOT AND HERE'S WHY

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:30.464
AND THIS GETS TO THE THIS GETS

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.766
TO THE DISCUSSION- IT'S JUST A

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:34.235
CARD WHICH IS CURRENTLY A

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:38.105
NATIONAL SANCTUARIES ONE MAJOR

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:39.173
THING THAT THEY ALL HAVE IN

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.741
COMMON I'M A CONSERVATION

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:43.444
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT YOU CAN'T DO

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:44.845
OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION AND YOU

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:48.349
CAN'T DO. ON EXTRACTION AND ALSO

01:34:48.416 --> 01:34:50.051
SEABED MINING THOSE SORTS OF

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:52.753
THINGS BONTA THAT'S A REALLY BIG

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.023
DEAL I DON'T MEAN A DISCOUNT

01:34:56.090 --> 01:34:57.091
THAT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:59.727
S. THE OF THIS IS THERE'S A

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:00.361
CONSISTENCY IN THEIR FROM THE

01:35:00.428 --> 01:35:02.296
STANDPOINT OF. OURS ARE

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.198
POLLUTION POLLUTION PREVENTION

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:06.333
REQUIREMENTS IS THERE MY THEIR

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:08.903
FISHING REQUIREMENTS ON FOR

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:10.304
EXTRACTION AND ANY OF THOSE

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.706
OTHER SORTS OF THINGS. AND SO

01:35:12.773 --> 01:35:14.742
RIGHT NOW THERE IS. A LITTLE BIT

01:35:14.809 --> 01:35:16.210
OF A DISAGREEMENT IT'S NOT A

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:18.479
100% CLEAR WHAT THE FEDS ARE

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:19.680
DOING ON THIS BUT IT APPEARS

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:21.248
THAT THEY WILL COUNT THEN ASKED

01:35:21.315 --> 01:35:22.917
ME THANKS REYES. I'M BUT FROM

01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:26.587
THE STANDPOINT OF. BY- DIVERSE

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:28.155
PROTECTION IN THIS IS THIS IS

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:30.491
REALLY A CRITICAL PART OF THIS

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.560
DISCUSSION. IS THAT ON THERE'S

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:34.228
THE BANKING RIGHT NOW STAFF AND

01:35:34.295 --> 01:35:36.564
WE BELIEVE ME THIS IS. IT HOW DO

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.766
WE GET TO THIRTY BY THIRTY NOT

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:41.368
GET TO THIRTY BY TOMORROW. ON

01:35:41.435 --> 01:35:44.638
AND SO ON THIS IS THE REASON WHY

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:46.340
WE NEED TO WORK. WITH

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:46.874
COMMUNITIES WITH MULTIPLE

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:48.442
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS ON THE GET

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:49.910
THESE SORTS OF DISCUSSIONS AND

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:52.012
SO. ON FOR NASH MEANS

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:52.913
SANCTUARIES AND WE'VE ALREADY

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:55.516
STARTED A DISCUSSION WITH- SOME

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:56.717
OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE

01:35:56.784 --> 01:35:58.552
SANCTUARIES. ON YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:35:58.619 --> 01:36:01.222
VERY VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS ON

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.990
WHAT ELSE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:04.258
PROTECT OUR BIODIVERSITY. SO

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:05.860
THAT'S WHERE I WAS GIVING

01:36:05.926 --> 01:36:08.362
EXAMPLES STARTED JUMPING AHEAD.

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:09.530
ON THINGS LIKE A VESSEL'S SPEED

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.965
ONE THAT BE YOUR PROJECT I

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.833
REMEMBER ALL ON IN YOUR DISTRICT

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.302
AS YOU NOW- THERE'S BEEN A LOT

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:17.571
OF WELL STRIKES ON ON AND SO

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:19.673
THAT'S- NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:21.041
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO GET BETTER AT

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:22.409
SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT LEVEL

01:36:22.476 --> 01:36:24.411
OF PROTECTION THAT COULD BE.

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:25.980
ADDED THERE ARE WHERE THE TEND

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.148
NOT BECOMES A SPEED ON THAT

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:29.650
RATHER THAN NON VOLUNTARY FOR

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.585
LARGER VESSELS. ON POLLUTION

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.921
PREVENTION ON AGAIN I KNOW YOU I

01:36:33.988 --> 01:36:34.855
KNOW YOU'RE YOU HAVE A STRONG

01:36:34.922 --> 01:36:36.690
BACKGROUND. ON THIS FROM THE

01:36:36.757 --> 01:36:38.058
STANDPOINT OF RUNOFF POLLUTION

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:40.427
WHAT CAN WE DO TO REDUCE PLASTIC

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:42.863
POLLUTION IN AN AREA THOSE ARE

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.901
BIODIVERSITY MEASURES THAT ARE

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:50.471
NOT. I HAVE NO TAKE NO CHANG I

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:51.238
MEAN NO FOR. THOSE SORTS OF

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:52.606
THINGS. AND SO ON. THAT'S AND I

01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:54.241
LIKE THAT WE REALLY LOOK. TO

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:56.310
HAVE. YOU THEM AND THE MONEY AND

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:57.444
YEARS AHEAD. ON TO GET THEIR

01:36:57.511 --> 01:36:59.480
SORE FEELING IS. THAT ON THE

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.682
CURRENT LEVEL OF CONSERVATION

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:03.551
PROVIDED BY NASA MEANS

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:05.686
SANCTUARIES. IS A GREAT START

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:07.388
BUT IT DOES NOT MEET THE

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:10.191
DURABILITY DEFINITION. FOR THE

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.426
BIO DIVERSITY PROTECTION.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:14.562
DEFINITION ON THE DOCTOR NORRIS

01:37:14.628 --> 01:37:16.664
LAID OUT IN THE DOCUMENT. IF I

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.399
TOOK THIS RUNNING BACK REAL

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:19.667
QUICK SO I THINK THERE'S ONE

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:20.801
THING MISSING FROM THIS

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.403
CONVERSATION THAT I WOULD JUST

01:37:22.469 --> 01:37:23.837
LIKE. YOU TO ADDRESS WHICH IS

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.573
NOBODY HAS DEFINED TERRIBLE WE

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:26.740
JUST KEEP SAYING THEY HAVE TO

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:29.076
BE. TERRIBLY PROTECTED BUT- AS

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:30.744
AN ATTORNEY I'D LIKE TO KNOW

01:37:30.811 --> 01:37:32.546
WHAT THAT MEANS. WHICH I THINK

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:34.582
MIGHT GET TO PART OF WHAT MR

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:36.650
BIGELOW IS SAYING IF THERE'S A

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:37.318
CONSERVATION EASEMENT FOR TWENTY

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:38.352
YEARS. I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S NOT

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:40.187
TERRIBLY PROTECTIVE- WE HAVE NO

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:43.757
DEFINITION AT THIS POINT. WHAT

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.993
IS IT OR IS IT WE DON'T KNOW

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.061
WHAT ARE MEANS BY TO. ACTUALLY

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:48.929
IT I CAN ACTUALLY NO BUT I MEAN

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.598
THE THIRTY BY THIRTY DEFINITION

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:52.199
MISTER GONNA YOURS NO I LIKE

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.200
ONLINE BUT IT'S NOT MINE IT'S

01:37:53.267 --> 01:37:54.735
JUST EIGHTY CALIFORNIA'S. IT'S

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:56.103
AN IN PERPETUITY AGREEMENT

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:56.870
BETWEEN THREE PARTIES LANDOWNER

01:37:56.937 --> 01:38:00.040
THE LOCAL AND THE STATE. ANY ONE

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:03.744
OF THE LOCAL. OR THE STATE CAN-

01:38:03.811 --> 01:38:05.813
ASKED TO BREAK THAT AGREEMENT.

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:07.581
BUT IT'S ADORABLE AGREEMENT THAT

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:10.284
GOES IN PERPETUITY AND TELL

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:11.852
SOMETHING IS BROKEN AND IT HAS

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:14.421
TO TAKE THE ORIGINAL LANDOWNERS.

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:15.389
AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:17.191
STATE THEN FOLLOWS UP WITH IT IT

01:38:17.258 --> 01:38:19.627
CAN. IN MOST CASES AGREED TO

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.028
DOING AWAY WITH THAT AGREEMENT

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:23.364
BUT IN MOST CASES IT WON'T RIGHT

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:24.765
SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:25.933
HOW THEY'RE DEFINING UNDER

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:26.967
THIRTY OR THIRTY DURABLE SO

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:28.902
THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:31.538
DURABLE BY THE RECOGNITION SO

01:38:31.605 --> 01:38:32.172
DOCTORS DO YOU MIND ADDRESSING

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:34.375
THIS QUESTION. AND I SURE OF

01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:38.112
WHAT HAPPENED TO- SO IN THE

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.947
DOCUMENT DO LIVE WHAT WE MEAN BY

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:41.882
DURABLE I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:44.018
STILL GREAT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT-

01:38:44.084 --> 01:38:45.552
SUPER WILLIAMS ACTORS TWENTY

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:46.987
YEARS ENOUGH WE LEAVE ROOM FOR

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:48.088
THAT BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:50.991
TALK ABOUT- LANDS THAT ARE IN

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:52.493
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP FOR YOU KNOW

01:38:52.559 --> 01:38:54.461
PERMANENTLY IN PUBLIC OWNERSHIP

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:56.297
FOR BIODIVERSITY PURPOSE THAT'S

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.532
ADORABLY PROTECTED AREA-

01:38:58.599 --> 01:38:59.733
CONSERVATION EASEMENTS AS WAS

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.736
DESCRIBED SO DURABLE- AGREEMENTS

01:39:02.803 --> 01:39:07.541
BETWEEN THREE PARTIES TO PROTECT

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:09.176
- AS WELL AS- AND THIS IS A

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:09.877
SOMEWHAT. CATEGORY BUT

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:12.012
ADMINISTRATIVELY PROTECTED AREAS

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.213
THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A FORMAL

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.748
RULE MAKING SO THE FEDERAL

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.450
GOVERNMENT OFTEN WILL DO A

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.652
RULEMAKING TRIED SOMETHING A

01:39:18.719 --> 01:39:19.987
ROADLESS AREA THAT TAKES YEARS

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.422
OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE WE

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:23.424
THINK THAT COUNTS AS A DURABLE

01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:25.826
PROTECTION OBVIOUSLY IF THAT IS

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:28.662
ON DONE THAT NOT CHANGES- OUR

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.464
OUR CALCULATION BUT- THOSE ARE

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.099
THE SORT OF THREE CATEGORIES

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:37.671
RECEIVED FOR FALLING INTO DURHAM. THANK YOU ARE. THAT OKAY RAND

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:40.574
HAD MEDICAL. THANK YOU SO I

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:42.576
BELIEVE IT DIDN'T IN- IN

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:44.845
RESPONSE TO THE COMMENTS AT

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:47.381
WHILE THEY'RE LOTS OF AREA THAT

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.450
IS IDENTIFIED AS OPEN SPACE WHAT

01:39:49.516 --> 01:39:52.119
YOU WERE TRYING TO DO IS TO HAVE

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:54.655
THAT AREA PEOPLE OPEN SPACE AND

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:56.523
ALL OF THESE OTHER DEFINITIONS

01:39:56.590 --> 01:39:58.258
THAT ARE OUT THERE. TO TRY TO

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.026
MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS THE

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.061
CRITERIA THAT FALL WITH WOULD

01:40:01.128 --> 01:40:02.663
FALL UNDER THIRTY BY THIRTY AND

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:05.032
SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:06.734
LEGITIMATE TO ISSUE IS SIMPLY

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.902
CLARIFYING OUR DEFINITIONS AS AS

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:10.337
YOU AS YOU MENTIONED AND THEN

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:11.972
FOR ALL OF US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:14.174
WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY THIRTY BY

01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:15.542
THREE. SO TO SAY WERE DONE OR

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:16.910
NOT DONE BASED ON HOW MUCH LAND

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:18.979
IS OUT THERE WERE WORK WE'RE NOT

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:19.947
DONE UNTIL WE CLARIFY OUR

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:22.182
DEFINITIONS AND WHEN WE DO THAT

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.251
AS AS FOR THIS TALKED ABOUT THAT

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.320
I THINK THAT'S THE EFFORT THAT

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:28.021
IS OUT THERE WHAT. YOU KNOW I

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:31.058
CERTAINLY HAVE LOTS OF WHICH

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:32.626
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NATIONAL-

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:34.762
FOREST LAND SOME OF THAT LAND IS

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:37.664
BEING HEAVILY AND THEY WERE

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.733
GONNA DO MINING ON A TECH CENTER

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.068
I'M NOT THAT MUCH I DON'T THINK

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:42.770
PEOPLE WOULD SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA

01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:44.638
COUNT THAT LAND AND SO. OF THE

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:46.440
THAT'S THE DISTINCTION BUT THE

01:40:46.507 --> 01:40:49.243
OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE IS-

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:52.045
EVAN DERANGED ACTUARY IS- AND

01:40:52.112 --> 01:40:54.515
THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS ARE.

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:57.284
HUGE IT OFF THE COAST OF-

01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:59.553

REPRESENTED 40% OF THE LAND AND

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:15.469
I DIDN'T CATCH 40% OF WHAT OF

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:18.439
WHAT LANDS SO COULD SOME OF THE

01:41:18.505 --> 01:41:23.610
WATERS UP. OF ALL THE CURRICULA

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:26.113
CAL. IS 4% OVER THE ANTS ANTS IN

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:28.248
STATE WATERS IT'S ACTUAL. ON

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:30.484

CREATED AND NOW THERE'S

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:03.617
TREMENDOUS BIODIVERSITY COMING

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:06.086
OUT OF THOSE HOW ARE THEY BEING

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:08.188
TREATED. SO THAT SERVICE SO WE

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:11.525
HAVE SOME WEIRD OVERLAPS HERE-

01:42:11.592 --> 01:42:13.560
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND THAT

AREAS AND SO WE HAVE MARINE

01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.375
PROTECTED AREAS WHICH HAVE AN

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:29.476
ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF PROTECTION

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:30.711

PERCENT OF WATERS IS. A STATE

01:42:58.338 --> 01:42:59.973

AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT INVESTMENT

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.375
FOR THAT COMMUNITY. AND IF YOU

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:17.678
CROSS THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER TO

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:19.846
THEIR SIDE THERE'S- OF INTERCOM

01:45:19.913 --> 01:45:23.116
- AND SET BECAUSE- I LIVE WITH

01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:25.719
WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT GREEN WE

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.354
CONNECTED THAT CONCRETE AND HAD

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:29.456
WE TREAT THAT TO BE A MORE OPEN.

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:30.891
GREEN OPEN SPACES I SEE A RIVER

01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.693
THAT'S BEEN. POURED OVER WITH

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:34.761
CONCRETE. ALONG THE WAY ABOVE WE

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:37.030
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANSWERS

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:38.765
ABOUT HOW WE DO THAT WE HAVE A

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.667
PIECE OF LAND THAT WE THINK WE

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:42.069
COULD ACQUIRE. ART AND THAT WE

01:45:42.135 --> 01:45:43.336
THINK WOULD BE THAT PERFECT

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:44.838
CONNECTOR BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:46.773
THAT WE QUALIFIER WE CAN. TAKE

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.709
OVER A BE PART OF THIS THIRTY BY

01:45:48.775 --> 01:45:50.610
THIRTY WHEN WE THINK OF THIRTY

01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:52.212
BY THIRTY WE THINK OF THAT AND

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:54.014
THAT. THAT CREATIVE THERE CAN

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:56.016
YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT FROM

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:56.950
DISCUSSIONS YOU HAD FROM DEATH

01:45:57.017 --> 01:45:59.920
AND- HOW AND IN SPACE CAN TO

01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:03.523
THIS SIX MILLION ACRE THAT YOU

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.792
HAVE. THANK YOU SOME. FOR THAT

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:07.894
QUESTION THAT'S SUCH IMPORTANT.

01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:09.229
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- FOR

01:46:09.296 --> 01:46:10.997
SMALLER SAY THAT THE CAR. WE'VE

01:46:11.064 --> 01:46:12.532
HAD AROUND STATE IT'S BEEN

01:46:12.599 --> 01:46:14.334
REMARKABLE HOW MANY PLACES HAVE

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:16.169
BEEN IDENTIFIED AS OPPORTUNITIES

01:46:16.236 --> 01:46:18.672
TO. HELP US MEET THE GOALS I'M

01:46:18.739 --> 01:46:20.907
THINK SPUR. IN URBAN AREAS.

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:23.210
LARGE ACRE BROWNFIELD COULD BE

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:25.879
RESTORED AND TURNED INTO-

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.647
THRIVING BIODIVERSITY AREAS THAT

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:28.915
ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS AND I'VE

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:30.684
SEEN THAT THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:33.320
SO THAT'S VERY EXCITING- BUT

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:35.722
ALSO I WANT TO REMIND. EVERYONE

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:37.657
THAT YOU KNOW THIRTY BY THIRTY

01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:38.158
IS DEFINITELY NOT. ALL

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:39.860
CONSERVATION IN CALIFORNIA NOR

01:46:39.926 --> 01:46:42.195
IS IT INTENDED TO MEET ALL OF

01:46:42.262 --> 01:46:44.865
OUR- OUTDOOR ACCESS PRIORITIES

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.600
WHICH IS WHY THE ADMINISTRATION.

01:46:46.666 --> 01:46:48.101
HAS LAUNCHED THE OUTDOORS FOR

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.870
ALL INITIATIVE SO WITHIN

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:50.904
CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:52.839
AGENCY WE ARE EMBARKING ON A

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:55.842
YEAR LONG CONVERSATION. ON HOW

01:46:55.909 --> 01:46:58.044
TO ENSURE THERE IS ACCESS FOR

01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.913
ALL TO PUT AN END IN OUTDOOR

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:01.882
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL YOU KNOW AS

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:03.250
AS THE COVERED CRISIS IDENTIFIED

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:04.885
FOR US SO MANY CALIFORNIANS HAD

01:47:04.951 --> 01:47:06.920
NO ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE. THAT'S

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.855
AN ISSUE WE WANT TO REMEDY AND

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.390
SO THE OUTER FOR ALL INITIATIVES

01:47:10.457 --> 01:47:12.492
DESIGNED INTENTIONALLY TO MAKE

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:13.627
SURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:15.796
PARKS. AND HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:47:15.862 --> 01:47:17.397
GET OUTSIDE AND ENJOY GREEN

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:20.000
SPACES SO THOSE THESE TWO PIECES

01:47:20.066 --> 01:47:22.102
GO TOGETHER. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

01:47:22.169 --> 01:47:23.503
NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE THERE ARE

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.972
PLACES WHERE CAN REALLY DO REAL

01:47:26.039 --> 01:47:27.707
IN. REST I'M I'M LOOKING AT.

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.009
ABOUT COASTAL WETLANDS AND ALL

01:47:29.075 --> 01:47:30.844
THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.512
PROMOTE CLIMATE RESILIENCE GIVE

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:34.815
PEOPLE ACCESS TO THE COAST AND

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:35.782
ALSO- PROVIDE FOR OUR

01:47:35.849 --> 01:47:37.284
BIODIVERSITY MANY OF THOSE ARE

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:40.220
CLOSE TO URBAN AREAS. SO WE SEE

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:41.521
ALL THESE LITTLE PIECES FITTING

01:47:41.588 --> 01:47:43.657
TOGETHER BUT THEY DON'T ALL-

01:47:43.723 --> 01:47:45.559
THEY'RE ALL COMPLETELY OVERLAP

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:47.561
IT'S A IT'S A VENN DIAGRAM.

01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:49.596
KICKED SOMETHING DOCTOR THERE

01:47:49.663 --> 01:47:55.435
PLEASE. ON THE- YOU KNOW NO.

01:47:55.502 --> 01:47:57.470
KNOW YOUR THIS I THINK INCLUDED

01:47:57.537 --> 01:48:00.841
SO GABRIEL WATERS. IN AND JOHN.

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:01.942
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AND NORMA

01:48:02.008 --> 01:48:05.679
STAFFORD'S ON AN NECKLACE AT-

01:48:05.745 --> 01:48:09.015
OVER THE DECK. I'M AYE AYE THIS

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:10.817
ISSUE AND IN THIS IS AN ERROR

01:48:10.884 --> 01:48:13.253
THAT- DOCTOR NINTH ABOUT A LOT

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.021
IS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT URBAN

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:17.657
PARKS AND CONNECTIVITY ON TO THE

01:48:17.724 --> 01:48:20.160
WILD LANDS ON I THINK IT'S

01:48:20.227 --> 01:48:20.894
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DEFINITELY.

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:23.230
EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT MOVING

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:25.498
FORWARD ON IN IN THAT REALIZING

01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:29.035
THAT ON IT OF THAT CONNECTIVITY

01:48:29.102 --> 01:48:30.070
ON RIVER RESTORATION AND

01:48:30.136 --> 01:48:31.872
WETLANDS ALONGSIDE THE RIVER AND

01:48:31.938 --> 01:48:33.773
AN OPEN SPACE ALONGSIDE THE

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.042
RIVER BUT ALSO MORE INTERNALLY.

01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:39.079
IF THERE'S DEMONSTRATE. BOMB

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:41.548
WHILE I CORD OR CAN. ON IT AND

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.884
THERE'S SOME PERMANENT TO IT ON

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:46.152
AND IT'S A LARGE ENOUGH SIZE

01:48:46.219 --> 01:48:48.889
THAT'S OF BIODIVERSITY BENEFIT I

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:50.056
MEAN WE SHOULD WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:52.192
GOING TO BE HAVING THIS

01:48:52.259 --> 01:48:52.792
CONVERSATIONS IT'S JUST. LOS

01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:54.527
ANGELES IN PARTICULAR IS SUCH A

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:56.396
UNIQUE SITUATION BECAUSE THE

01:48:56.463 --> 01:48:58.465
INCREDIBLE BIODIVERSITY THERE

01:48:58.531 --> 01:48:59.933
SAN DIEGO ITSELF FALLS INTO THIS

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.470
CATEGORY AS WELL BOND AND BEING

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:06.306
ABLE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:49:06.373 --> 01:49:08.508
ABOUT. ON IT YOU KNOW BECAUSE

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.977
THE NEXUS BETWEEN DOUBTS AS AS

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:12.746
DR NORTH OF PRODUCT I IT'S I

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:15.048
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:18.184
IN FOR SO I WITH ARE ALL PART OF

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:19.386
THERE SO I COULD FOLLOW UP TO

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:20.787
THE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT IS

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.522
ACTUALLY NEXT TO THIS AND GAVE

01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:25.258
OVER A BED- AND I'LL I I'M WHICH

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:26.092
BETWEEN THE SINGER WILL IN THE

01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:28.595
L. A. RIVER BETH TO CONCRETE MY

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:30.230
- THAT USED TO BE REVERSED. BOSS

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.998
LET ME LET ME SAY THAT EVERY

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.600
TIME WE USE THE WORD RIVER YOU

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:35.235
GET TO CONCRETE MONSTERS OF EVER

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:36.970
ANYMORE AND IF THERE'S WATER TO

01:49:37.037 --> 01:49:38.405
THE IT'S BEEN THIS TRIED AND

01:49:38.471 --> 01:49:40.173
SEWER SYSTEMS MY AREA- BUT THAT

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.808
IS OUR BIODIVERSITY AND WE NEED

01:49:41.875 --> 01:49:43.310
TO GO BACK TO RESTORING THE

01:49:43.376 --> 01:49:44.911
SPACES AND WE THINK ABOUT THIRTY

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:46.913
BY THIRTY. THOSE ARE THE SPACES

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:48.248
THAT WE LIVE WITH AND WHEN YOU

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:50.550
SAY ABOUT A LOT OF SPACE WHAT IS

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:51.952
THAT MARGIN OF SPACE BECAUSE I

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:52.919
FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT REALISTIC

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:55.422
IN ONE OF THE DENSEST. AREAS OF

01:49:55.488 --> 01:49:56.790
CALIFORNIA LET YOU KNOW SPACE

01:49:56.856 --> 01:50:04.030
MIGHT ONLY BE A HALF AN ACRE. I

01:50:04.097 --> 01:50:05.198
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANY

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:06.933
MANY A OR AS WELL MANY MANY

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.568
ACRES. THAT WAY THAT'S COUNTRY.

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:09.903
AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S ONE TALK

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.004
ABOUT THESE. THAT ARE REALLY A

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:13.273
AND I CAN SERVICE TO EXCITED

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.308
ABOUT IT THE TRANSFER OUT HOW TO

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:16.676
A PART OF IT WE GET TOLD ALEXI

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:17.844
NOT MAYBE MAYBE LATER ON WITH

01:50:17.911 --> 01:50:19.079
THIS OTHER PROJECT IT'S ALWAYS

01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:22.048
LATER ON AND NEVER TRICKLE SAID.

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:22.716
AND THAT'S WHEN THE FEELING LIKE

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:23.950
THIS IS TRUE DOWN ENVIRONMENT-

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:24.884
WHICH HAS BY THE COUNTIES ON

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:27.187
PURPOSE AND SO I HAVE A LACK OF

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:28.388
IMPATIENCE IT'S BEEN ALL MY

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:29.856
LIFE- AND I LITERALLY HAVE TO

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:32.025
MAKE THE CHOICE OF DO I QUITE ON

01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:33.059
THE RIVER BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:33.960
PARALLEL TO THE FREEWAY THAT

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:35.795
MOVES ALL THE GETS MOMENTS FROM

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:38.231
THE PORT TO THE REALLY GREAT. MY

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:39.265
DISTRICT AND HOW HEALTHY IS THAT

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:40.300
LITTLE TREE BUFFER SOME WEIGHT

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:41.901
MIGHT BE YOU KNOW APPRECIATED AS

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:43.737
WELL. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE

01:50:43.803 --> 01:50:45.205
MY FRUSTRATIONS COMING I'M VERY

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:47.474
EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT-

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.608
THE SIMPLE FIGURE IT OUT OR

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:49.709
SOMETHING DIFFERENT DOESN'T

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:53.713
ALWAYS SEEM TO CATCH UP IN MY

01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:59.853
COMMUNITY. MR ALL RANDOM MESSAGE

01:50:59.919 --> 01:51:01.654
. THANK YOU A MANAGER I'M VERY

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.289
GRATEFUL THAT MEMBER GARCIA FOR

REFER RAISING AN ISSUE THAT

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.028
REALLY EVEN IN THE ORIGINAL

01:51:08.094 --> 01:51:08.995
THIRTY THIRTIES ARE AS AS I

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:10.964
WROTE IT THERE WAS A DUAL

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:13.199
PURPOSE ONE IS TO PROTECT PLAN

01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:14.667
WHAT ARE THE OTHER ONE WAS

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:16.436
ACCESS AND AN EQUITY AS WELL-

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:19.773
AND I HAVE MY BILL THIS YEAR AB

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:22.776
THIRTY- WHICH FOCUSES ON-

01:51:22.842 --> 01:51:26.312
ENVIRONMENT IT THE OUTDOOR. TO

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:28.782
NATURE AND I THINK IT REALLY

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:30.750
BLENDS WELL WITH THE COMMENTS

01:51:30.817 --> 01:51:35.121
THAT COULD THAT- ASSEMBLY GARCIA

01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:36.256
. TENSION IN THAT THERE ARE ALL

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:38.358
THESE LAW PRIDE IN AREAS BECAUSE

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:39.526
BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF

01:51:39.592 --> 01:51:40.660
OPPORTUNITIES AND- COMMUNITIES

01:51:40.727 --> 01:51:41.961
LIKE MINE AND CERTAINLY IN

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:43.296
SUMMER GARCIA'S WERE B. THAT

WEATHER IS OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:51:45.198 --> 01:51:48.968
CREATE SPACES AND TO CREATE- IN

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:53.807
ABOUT TO CREATE. FOR ACCESS- TO

01:51:53.873 --> 01:51:56.342
OPEN SPACE- AND SO YOU KNOW I

01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:59.546
THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE-

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:01.281
ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:03.116
WE NEED TO WAIT ON IF I HAVE

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:05.018
ANOTHER BILL PUT UP FOR POCKET

01:52:05.085 --> 01:52:05.985
FOURS. YOUR NEED THIRTY FEET BY

01:52:06.052 --> 01:52:08.421
THIRTY FEET TO CREATE A PROBLEM

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:09.756
FOR US WAS EXTREMELY- BENEFITS

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:10.990
FOR BIODIVERSITY INCREASING

01:52:11.057 --> 01:52:14.060
GREEN SPACES. AS WELL- AS I JUST

01:52:14.127 --> 01:52:16.529
WANT TO MAKE THAT AS A AS A

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:18.431
GENERAL COMMENT THAT THAT- IS

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:20.033
NOT A NICE TO HAVE IT'S A MUST

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.835

SUPPORT TRAVEL ENTITIES OF

01:52:38.485 --> 01:52:39.786
THINGS WOULD BE CRITICAL THOSE

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:41.354
PARTNERSHIPS IF YOU WANT TO MEET

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:42.755
THESE GOALS IN A MEANINGFUL

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.991
MANNER- AND- A QUESTION

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:46.926
REGARDING I GUESS WHAT OTHER

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:48.094
MEANINGFUL WAYS IS IT

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:49.829
ADMINISTRATION. OFFERING TO

01:52:49.896 --> 01:52:51.297
OTHER KIND OF COMMUNITY BASED

01:52:51.364 --> 01:52:54.234
ORGANIZATIONS TO MEET SOME OF

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.368
THESE GOALS AND THE LARGER ISSUE

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:58.805
OF- JUST. IN GENERAL IN ORDER TO

01:52:58.872 --> 01:53:00.773
PROVIDE FOR ACQUISITION

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.342
RESTORATION MANAGEMENT SO IT'S

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:04.444
GONNA BE A LOT OF MONEY AS

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.078
OPPOSED TO ADMINISTRATION PLAN.

01:53:05.145 --> 01:53:06.613
PROVIDED FUNDING OVER THE LONG

01:53:06.679 --> 01:53:12.185
TERM IN WORKING OBVIOUSLY BUT.

01:53:12.252 --> 01:53:14.154
THE LEGISLATURE. WELL THE A

01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:16.356
THAT'S A I'M NOT. FULLY READY TO

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:17.991
ANSWER I WILL SAY YOU KNOW IT'S

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:19.025
CLEAR IN OUR DOCUMENT THAT WE

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:20.894
RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S NOT ALL OF

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:22.028
THE FUNDING IS GOING TO COME

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:23.863
FROM THE STATE RIGHT SOME OF

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.064
THIS IS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:26.633
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND

01:53:26.699 --> 01:53:28.101
AS  POINTED OUT- WHEN I WENT

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:29.169
THROUGH THEPATHWAYS. THERE'S

01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:30.837
ACTUALLY A LOT OF CONSERVATION

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:38.678
THAT'S HAPPENING NOW FROM. TO

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:40.480
YOUR PROJECTS AND EVEN SMALL

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:41.381
PROJECTS THAT ISN'T BEING DONE

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:42.916
IN A STRATEGIC WAY SO WE CAN

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:44.784
ACTUALLY LEVERAGE EXISTING MONEY

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:46.953
AND USE IT TO SUPPORT THIRTY BY

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.521
THIRTY MORE EFFECTIVELY. SO I

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:49.856
THINK THERE'S A SUITE OF

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.524
APPROACHES THAT ARE GOING TO GET

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:54.394
US THERE- BUT OBVIOUSLY. IT'S A

01:53:54.460 --> 01:53:56.162
LONG TERM COMMITMENT AND I'M NOT

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:57.897
YOU KNOW YOU ASKED A BIT ABOUT

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:58.731
WORKING WITH COMMUNITY

01:53:58.798 --> 01:54:00.733
ORGANIZATIONS AND WHAT THE

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.668
MINISTRATIONS DOING I MEAN WE

01:54:01.734 --> 01:54:04.771
THINK THAT'S THAT'S CENTRAL TO-

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:06.506
MAKING THIS WORK. AND PART OF

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:08.441
WHAT YOU'LL SEE AS WE ROLL OUT

01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:10.143
OUR PROPOSAL- FOR THAT NATURE

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:12.345
BASED SOLUTIONS SET ASIDE. BUT

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:12.912
YOU KNOW THE HUNDRED MILLION

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:14.547
DOLLARS FOR TRIBES WE THOUGHT

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:15.782
WAS A REALLY SIGNIFICANT DOWN

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:16.950
PAYMENT IN THAT DIRECTION. YEAH

01:54:17.016 --> 01:54:20.186
I AGREE I THINK THAT THERE'S-

01:54:20.253 --> 01:54:21.054
THE PARTNERSHIP ASPECT IS GOING

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.956
TO HAPPEN COME WITH RESOURCES.

01:54:23.022 --> 01:54:24.991
THAT HELP TO LEVERAGE THE- STATE

01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:26.159
FUNDS WHETHER IT'S LIKE YOU BE

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:28.661
IN OUR AREA THEY OPEN. OR OR

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:33.499
THERE ARE TRUSTS THAT. WITH WITH

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:34.801
. PARTNERSHIP CAN REALLY GET A

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:36.002
LOT OF BANG FOR THEIR BUCK AS

01:54:36.069 --> 01:54:38.504
WELL AS- TAKING BAGS OF THE

01:54:38.571 --> 01:54:39.305
STATE RESOURCES. AND THE- THE

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:41.307
LAST QUESTION I HAVE. IS

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:42.675
REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:45.578
THIRTY THIRTY. OF OVER THE NEXT

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:47.714
EIGHT YEARS AND- HOW WE ENSURE

01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:49.015
THAT FUTURE GOVERNMENTS WILL

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:51.651
CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS- NOT ONLY

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:53.620

02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:21.714
PLANNING GROUPS OF THAT SORT SO.

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:24.483
IT REALLY CAN BE ANY ANY ONE OF

02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:25.818
THOSE AT. MY I MIGHT TAKE A

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:30.856
MOMENT JUST TO- TO DO A LITTLE

02:00:30.923 --> 02:00:32.058
MORE. ABOUT OF THIS WHAT COUNTS

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:33.793
AND DOESN'T. THERE'S NOT SOME

02:00:33.859 --> 02:00:35.928

ON WHICH PROJECTS ARE IN IN

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:41.634
WHICH PROJECTS ARE OUT WE'RE

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:43.002
REALLY INTERESTED IN USING

02:00:43.069 --> 02:00:45.805
EXISTING PROGRAMS OF EXISTING.

02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:47.406
APPROACHES TO GETTING THIS

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:49.609
CONSERVE DONE SO ALL THE THINGS

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:50.943
THAT ARE TRIED AND TRUE THAT WE

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:53.446

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:11.931
APPROACHES HOW TO GET THIS WORK

02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:14.000
DONE SO THEY'RE NOT SORT OF A

02:01:14.066 --> 02:01:15.401
SEPARATE. A LEDGER THAT WE USE

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:16.769

WAS A HOT TOPIC BUT I THINK THEY

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:18.350
CAN- DOESN'T JUST LET THE

02:04:18.417 --> 02:04:19.752
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SET THE TONE

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:20.853

THINK THAT BIODIVERSITY IS

02:04:28.928 --> 02:04:30.596
SOMETHING THAT FOR TOO LONG HAS

02:04:30.663 --> 02:04:32.298
NOT BEEN AT THE- CENTER OF

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:33.165
CONVERSATIONS AND IT'S SO

02:04:33.232 --> 02:04:34.600
CRITICAL. AND THE MORE WORK WE

02:04:34.667 --> 02:04:36.335
DO THE BETTER OFF AND CALIFORNIA

02:04:36.402 --> 02:04:37.970

INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS- AND

02:04:40.806 --> 02:04:41.807
THAT SORT OF. INTO MY FIRST

02:04:41.874 --> 02:04:44.109
QUESTION WHICH IS SIX. ACRES IN

02:04:44.176 --> 02:04:47.279
EIGHT YEARS WHICH- IS A LOT. AND

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:49.281
DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:50.850
ACRES PER YEAR WE'VE BEEN

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:52.451
CONSERVING TO DATE. HOW WE'RE

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:54.386
GONNA. I ASSUME WE NEED TO

02:04:54.453 --> 02:04:56.622
ACCELERATE THAT. SIGNIFICANTLY I

02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:57.623
KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE MONEY YOU'RE

02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:58.824
DISCUSSING WILL BE A PORTION OF

02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:00.893

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:03.529
OF LOCAL SIX MILLION ACRES AND-

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:07.199
THE NEXT. SECTION SIX. YEAH I

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:11.237
OF IT IS A LOT- I DON'T HAVE A

02:05:11.303 --> 02:05:14.273
RATE PER YEAR AND I THINK IN

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:14.840
CALIFORNIA ARE CONSERVATION

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:15.975
PROBABLY GOES IN WAVES RIGHT WE

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:18.444
GET THESE BIG BONDS AND GRANTS

02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:19.912
AND PUT. THE A BUNCH AND THEN IT

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:22.414

CALIFORNIA BY DIVERSITY COUNCIL-

02:05:28.587 --> 02:05:30.089
WE ACTUALLY PUT OUT A CALL TO

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:31.957
ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.959
WITHIN THE COUNCIL AND ASK THEM

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:35.561
FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY

02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:36.161
ADMINISTER THAT ARE GOING TO

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:38.063
HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE ON THIRTY

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:39.265
BY THIRTY. AND THAT WILL

02:05:39.331 --> 02:05:42.167
ACTUALLY BE AN APPENDIX TO THE

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:43.535
PATHWAYS REPORT. SO WE'RE GONNA

02:05:43.602 --> 02:05:45.104
HAVE A- NOT EVERY PROGRAM BUT

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:46.538
SORT OF THE TOP FIVE PROGRAMS

02:05:46.605 --> 02:05:49.808
THAT ARE REALLY GOING TO MAKE A

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:52.044
PUT OUT OF WE DID A SURVEY AND

02:05:52.111 --> 02:05:54.013
THAT SURVEY WE ASKED YOU KNOW

02:05:54.079 --> 02:05:55.347
HOW MANY ACRES DO YOU THINK YOU

02:05:55.414 --> 02:05:57.116
CAN GET. WITH THIS PROGRAM THIS

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:59.351
YEAR AND IN COMING YEARS YOU

02:05:59.418 --> 02:06:01.153
KNOW UNDER AT LEAST THIS BY THE

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.289
- INITIATIVE. AND SORT THROUGH

02:06:03.355 --> 02:06:04.990
THAT EFFORT I DID A VERY GROSS

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:06.625
DON'T ASK ME FOR THE DETAILS

02:06:06.692 --> 02:06:07.626
BACK OF THE ENVELOPE

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.128
CALCULATION. AND I THINK WE'RE

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:10.696
REALLY ON THE PATH AS LONG AS WE

02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:12.398
CONTINUE THIS PARTNERSHIP AND WE

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:13.699
DRIVE ON THESE VERY. DIFFERENT

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:16.535
APPROACHES SO IT'S NOT ALL JUST.

02:06:16.602 --> 02:06:18.971
ACQUIRING LAND THROUGH THE NOTES

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:21.407
STATE COPPERS BUT THERE'S A DESK

02:06:21.473 --> 02:06:23.175
. OF WAYS TO GET THERE I THINK

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:27.212
IT IS AMBITIOUS BUT ALSO VERY

02:06:27.279 --> 02:06:28.681
DOABLE. AND THEN ONCE REQUIRE

02:06:28.747 --> 02:06:30.916
ALL THIS LAND I THIS TO. OF THIS

02:06:30.983 --> 02:06:32.484
LAND AND I WANNA AT. JOIN THE

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.820
CHORUS OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE

02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:35.788
COMMENDING YOU FOR YOUR

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:37.156
PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR NATIVE

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:37.856
PEOPLE BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:39.425
BEEN. INCREDIBLE STORIES OF OUR

02:06:39.491 --> 02:06:41.593
LAND WELL WE HAVE GOT HERE- BUT

02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:42.895
AS WE ACQUIRE THIS LAND

02:06:42.962 --> 02:06:44.063
OBVIOUSLY THE ON GOING

02:06:44.129 --> 02:06:46.565
STEWARDSHIP OF THIS LAND IS

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:47.666
REALLY CRITICAL WORK WE HAVE.

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:49.134
BEEN OUR WILDFIRE PROBLEM IS IN

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:50.936
PART BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT BEEN

02:06:51.003 --> 02:06:52.071
MAINTAINING OUR LANDS AS WE

02:06:52.137 --> 02:06:54.006
SHOULD HAVE. SO I GUESS PART OF

02:06:54.073 --> 02:06:55.240
MY QUESTION IS OKAY WE HAVE THIS

02:06:55.307 --> 02:06:57.142
GREAT GOAL WE'RE GOING TO GET

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:58.844

TELL YOU THAT THIS WAS A VERY

02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:06.385
HOT TOPIC IN OUR PUBLIC

02:07:06.452 --> 02:07:07.820
ENGAGEMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A

02:07:07.886 --> 02:07:09.688
GREAT TRACK RECORD OF. GETTING

02:07:09.755 --> 02:07:11.223
LAND UNDER CONSERVATION AND THEN

02:07:11.290 --> 02:07:12.825
NOT ALWAYS PARK. TAKING CARE OF

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:14.693
IT THE WAY WE SHOULD AND NOT

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:15.861
INVESTING IN THAT STEWARDSHIP

02:07:15.928 --> 02:07:17.196
AND SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE

02:07:17.262 --> 02:07:18.797
THAT THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL

02:07:18.864 --> 02:07:21.867
ELEMENT- YOU KNOW. WE WERE JUST

02:07:21.934 --> 02:07:23.635
TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE LAND

02:07:23.702 --> 02:07:25.771
EASEMENTS YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GREAT

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:27.740
ABOUT THOSE IS THAT. THE

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.408
MANAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY BUILT

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.443
INTO THE WAY THAT THE LAND IS

02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:33.312
CONSERVED AND SO THOSE ARE GREAT

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:35.180
EXAMPLES OF WHERE IT'S WORKING

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:36.815
WELL I THINK- WE NEED TO UP OUR

02:07:36.882 --> 02:07:39.551
GAME FIRST EVER CHECK ON A LOT

02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:40.686
OF OUR- ARE ALREADY CONSERVE

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:41.920
PLANS AND BUILD THAT INTO THE

02:07:41.987 --> 02:07:44.390
PROCESS. I DON'T HAVE AN EASY

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:46.125
ANSWER FOR YOU BUT I. CAN TELL

02:07:46.191 --> 02:07:47.926
YOU THAT THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL

02:07:47.993 --> 02:07:48.994
PIECE. I AGREE THANK YOU LET'S

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:50.696
KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT BECAUSE

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:52.097
LASSEN ON DO IS CREATE A- BIG

02:07:52.164 --> 02:07:53.899
MESSING CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:55.467
THINGS THAT REALLY STRUCK ME IN

02:07:55.534 --> 02:07:56.668
IN READING YOU KNOW THE

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:58.203
MATERIALS AROUND THIRTY BY

02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:59.271
THIRTY WAS HOW POORLY WE'RE

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:01.407
DOING ON WETLANDS THAT WE LOST

02:08:01.473 --> 02:08:03.108
90% OF OUR WETLANDS DUE TO A

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:05.611
WHOLE HOST OF REASONS- AND SO IT

02:08:05.677 --> 02:08:09.114
SEEMS LIKE. YOU KNOW I DON'T

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:10.716
LIVE IN AN AREA WITH MUCH- BUT-

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:12.918
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT NEEDS TO BE A

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:14.386
PRIORITY IN THIS- IS REALLY

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:16.522
WHERE HAVE WE TAKEN THE BIGGEST

02:08:16.588 --> 02:08:18.424
HIT I THINK THIS GOES A LITTLE

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:18.991
BIT TO WHAT. MR BIGELOW WAS

02:08:19.058 --> 02:08:21.093
FOCUSING ON AND WHERE HAVE WE

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:22.061
REACHED OUR GOALS WERE HAVEN'T

02:08:22.127 --> 02:08:24.096
WE AND I THINK ONE OF THE

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:24.997
QUESTION SHOULD BE WHERE WE

02:08:25.064 --> 02:08:26.165
STRUGGLING THE MOST. IN TERMS OF

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:28.100
BY. AND I WOULD THINK FROM THE

02:08:28.167 --> 02:08:29.868
READ MY READING THAT THAT WOULD

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:31.537
BE WETLANDS IS THERE PRIOR. IN

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:34.473
THAT REGARD. CLINTON I THINK ANY

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.575
. IS NOT PRIORITIZING LENS IS

02:08:36.642 --> 02:08:38.243
NOT TELLING YOU. THE WHOLE STORY

02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:39.178
I MEAN WE KNOW THAT THAT'S

02:08:39.244 --> 02:08:41.246
IMPORTANT WHEREVER WE ARE SOME

02:08:41.313 --> 02:08:42.314
YES LIKE THAT. THAT'S A CRITICAL

02:08:42.381 --> 02:08:43.482
THING IN EVERY ECOSYSTEM IS

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:44.983
MAKING SURE THAT THE WETLANDS OR

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.784
THE FRESH WATER THAT'S

02:08:45.851 --> 02:08:46.919
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM OR THE

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:50.956
BRACKISH WATER. IS PROTECTED- SO

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.224
IN THE IN THE DOCUMENT WE

02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:55.761
IDENTIFY- SORT OF. OUR

02:08:55.828 --> 02:08:57.830
PRINCIPLES FOR MEETING OUR ABOUT

02:08:57.896 --> 02:08:59.598
. CITY OBJECTIVE AND- FOR OUR

02:08:59.665 --> 02:09:01.166
PRIORITIES I SHOULD SAY. AND IN

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:02.801
THAT WE IDENTIFIED UNDER

02:09:02.868 --> 02:09:05.471
REPRESENTED ECOSYSTEMS AS KEY.

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:07.806
AND IT OR PLACES THAT ARE

02:09:07.873 --> 02:09:09.108
ALREADY VERY RARE OR DEGRADED

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:11.276
AND YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S FALLS

02:09:11.343 --> 02:09:12.177
INTO THAT CATEGORY THERE'S A

02:09:12.244 --> 02:09:13.679
SUITE OF OTHER. SYSTEMS AND BLUE

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.114
OAK WOODLANDS COMES TO MIND THAT

02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:17.015
ARE ACTUALLY REALLY DOWN TO A

02:09:17.082 --> 02:09:19.084
VERY. SMALL PROPORTION OF WHAT

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.353
WE HAD IN THE PAST- WE- WANT TO

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:24.723
DO A DEEPER. DIVE INTO ANALYZING

02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:26.091
WHERE WE HAVE PROTECTED AREAS

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:28.026
USING THAT CA NATURE GIS THAT I

02:09:28.093 --> 02:09:29.928
MENTIONED. TO REALLY LOOK AT

02:09:29.995 --> 02:09:31.897
WHERE DO WE HAVE NEEDS ACROSS

02:09:31.964 --> 02:09:33.665
THE ECOSYSTEMS OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:36.135
WHERE CAN WE INVEST IN TO. MAKE

02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:36.969
SURE WE'RE MEETING OUR

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:37.870
BIODIVERSITY GOALS. SO THAT'S-

02:09:37.936 --> 02:09:40.038
WORK TO CALM AND CONVERSATIONS

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:40.906
THAT WE'RE HAVING. I MENTIONED

02:09:40.973 --> 02:09:42.174
THE CALIFORNIA BIODIVERSITY

02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:43.942
NETWORK THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:46.311
ROUND TABLE THAT'S- DESIGNER.

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:48.313
THAT CONVERSATION NO WHERE IS

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:50.082
THE MOST IMPORTANT- PATTERSON

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:51.750
PROTECTIONS THAT WE SHOULD.

02:09:51.817 --> 02:09:54.019
REALLY BE DIGGING INTO. THANK I

02:09:54.086 --> 02:09:56.722
WOULD ALSO. I WOULD ALSO ADD ON

02:09:56.788 --> 02:09:59.258
THE COASTAL. SIDE IT'S BEEN A-

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:02.027
VERY. BIG PRIORITY IN THE OCEAN

02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:06.298
. CARE STRATEGIC PLANS BAND-

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:07.900
WHAT WHEN A CAR. ON YOU SEE

02:10:07.966 --> 02:10:09.902
INVEST. THAT DR NO PUT OUT THERE

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:12.037
BY HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ON

02:10:12.104 --> 02:10:14.273
CLOSER AS- NATURE. SOLUTIONS A

02:10:14.339 --> 02:10:15.874
LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE THE

02:10:15.941 --> 02:10:17.609
WETLAND. ON AND LIVING SHORELINE

02:10:17.676 --> 02:10:20.546
HABITAT BOTH OF WHICH ARE. ON

02:10:20.612 --> 02:10:22.481
THERE'S SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:24.216
NEEDS THEY ARE DOING HABITAT AND

02:10:24.283 --> 02:10:25.651
IT'S REALLY. WIPED OUT ALMOST

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:28.253
BADLY AS- CONSEQUENCE IN THE

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.355
STATE. I'M SO THE PRIORITIES

02:10:30.422 --> 02:10:38.997
THERE. THERE'S SOME FIND BEING

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:40.799
AND I CAN TELL YOU BEST OR READ

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:42.334
FOR. ALSO INTO ACCOUNT THE LIKE

02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:44.770
SEQUESTERING. AND RIGHTS- ALSO

02:10:44.836 --> 02:10:46.772
IT IS A VERY BIG PART THIS AS

02:10:46.838 --> 02:10:49.041
WELL NOT ABOUT HER SEASIDE.

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:52.945
THANK YOU IN. I'M NOT GONNA DR

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:54.646
WILL HAVE YOU EVER QUESTIONS ON

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:56.315
. SO- YOU MENTIONED THAT DOING

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:57.282
OUR OF MARIE PROTECTED. AND SO

02:10:57.349 --> 02:10:58.884
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE INCLUDED

02:10:58.951 --> 02:11:00.652
IN THE PLAN WE WENT THROUGH A

02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:01.920
LOT OF BACK AND FORTH ABOUT.

02:11:01.987 --> 02:11:03.121
FEDERER'S REJECT AREAS I REALLY

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:04.957
APPRECIATED WHAT YOU WERE SAYING

02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:06.959
ABOUT ONLY. FOCUSING ON THOSE

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:07.960
AREAS THAT ARE TRULY PROTECTING

02:11:08.026 --> 02:11:09.494
THE BIODIVERSITY OF OUR OCEANS

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:11.430
BUT THEN YOU ALSO AID THAT

02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:12.764
BECAUSE OF THAT REVIEW WE'RE

02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:13.799
NOT. GOING TO INCLUDE IN THIS

02:11:13.865 --> 02:11:15.234
INITIAL PLAN ADDITIONAL MARINE

02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:17.302
PROTECTED AREAS. I'M JUST

02:11:17.369 --> 02:11:19.238
CALLING ON IT UNDERNEATH AND

02:11:19.304 --> 02:11:21.273
YOU. THAT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:23.308
IT'S BEEN DARN JARGON HIM SO I

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:29.081
PLEDGE I FOR ALL THAT. I'M THE

02:11:29.147 --> 02:11:30.182
ON THE- SIDE WE TALK ABOUT

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:31.917
NATIONALLY SANCTION. RIGHT AND

02:11:31.984 --> 02:11:33.919
THEN ON THIS. SIDE WE MARIE PER

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.087
. AREA WERE SAYING THAT THE

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.521
STATE MARIE PROTECTED AREAS ALL

02:11:36.588 --> 02:11:38.590
COUNT. SO THE ALL HUNDRED TWENTY

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:39.791
FOUR ABOUT I UNDERSTAND I'M NOT

02:11:39.858 --> 02:11:41.393
SAYING WHAT COUNTS ANYTHING TO

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:42.961
GET HER GOAL WHICH WE ARE

02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:44.796
FURTHER ON IN OCEANS WE MORE

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:46.632
WORK TO DO IN OUR OCEANS RIGHT.

02:11:46.698 --> 02:11:48.000
YOU SAID BECAUSE IT A REVIEW I

02:11:48.066 --> 02:11:49.801
THINK BECAUSE OUR ON GOING

02:11:49.868 --> 02:11:50.869
REVIEW OF OUR MARINE PROTECTED

02:11:50.936 --> 02:11:52.070
AREAS IN THE INITIAL PLAN THAT

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:53.805
WILL COME OUT IN THE COMING

02:11:53.872 --> 02:11:56.041
MONTHS I BELIEVE. YOU WILL NOT

02:11:56.108 --> 02:11:56.608
BE DDING ADDITIONAL MORNING

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:59.144
PROTECTED AREAS ALL. EXPLAINED

02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:01.546
HOW HE EVER GET TO COSTA WATER

02:12:01.613 --> 02:12:05.584
PROTECTION WITHOUT THAT. THREE

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:06.885
THREE. THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:09.988
POINT AND HERE'S WHY. ON WHICH

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:12.958
IS. A LOT OF THIS IS A RESPECT

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:14.760
PROCESS ON ISSUE WHICH IS ABOUT

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.161
FOUR THIRTY BY THIRTY CAME OUT-

02:12:16.228 --> 02:12:17.996
OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD THE MARINE

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:19.731
LIFE PROTECTION ACT. AND THE

02:12:19.798 --> 02:12:22.401
NETWORK OF MPAS WAS CREATED AND

02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:24.670
MANAGED BY TWENTY TWELVE- I'M

02:12:24.736 --> 02:12:26.805
ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WAS TO

02:12:26.872 --> 02:12:27.906
PUT TOGETHER AND THE CABLE

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:29.408
MANAGEMENT RUBIO. I'M AT THAT

02:12:29.474 --> 02:12:32.144
TIME. I'M THERE'S BEEN A GREAT

02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:35.180
DEAL OF FINDING INVESTED INTO

02:12:35.247 --> 02:12:38.417
DOING ON SCIENCE TO ASSESS. WHAT

02:12:38.483 --> 02:12:40.619
THE APPETITE SEE AN IMPACTS OF

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:42.988
THAT NETWORK IT HAS SPENT A LOT

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:44.156
OF THE SCIENCES- HAS JUST BEEN

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:47.125
PUBLISHED IN THE LAST. LAST

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:49.094
MONTH IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK

02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:52.764
AT IT- SO IT'S OUT THERE- SO

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:55.267
THIS FINAL REPORT. ASSESSING I'M

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:58.170
THE EFFICACY OF ON. THE EMPTY

02:12:58.236 --> 02:12:59.905
AND OUR OVER THE DECADE WILL

02:12:59.971 --> 02:13:02.941
COME OUT AT THE- FIRST QUARTER

02:13:03.008 --> 02:13:04.543
OF NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

02:13:04.609 --> 02:13:06.678
THREE. AND SO MIGHT WAS JUST.

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:08.847
BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY

02:13:08.914 --> 02:13:10.782
STAKEHOLDERS ON ALL SIDES BUT

02:13:10.849 --> 02:13:13.518
THEIR CONSERVATION OR IN AS WELL

02:13:13.585 --> 02:13:14.152
AS THE FISHING ARENA AND BELIEVE

02:13:14.219 --> 02:13:15.787
ME. SPORTFISHING A LOT DIFFERENT

02:13:15.854 --> 02:13:17.589
THAN COMMERCIAL FISHING ON

02:13:17.656 --> 02:13:21.093
INTEREST THERE. ON WE SAID IF

02:13:21.159 --> 02:13:22.961
I'M THIRTY BY FOR AS WE WEREN'T

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:25.731
GOING TO JUMP AHEAD TO MAKE A

02:13:25.797 --> 02:13:27.799
DETERMINATION ON WHAT WE NEED TO

02:13:27.866 --> 02:13:30.669
DO. ON BY EXPANDING THE MPA

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:33.071
NETWORK INTEL ALL THE SCIENCE

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.272
AND THE ASSESSMENT IS AND SO IT

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:35.874
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE NOT

02:13:35.941 --> 02:13:37.909
GOING TO DO IT AS A MATTER OF

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:39.644
FACT IT'S ONLY A YEAR AWAY. FROM

02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:40.779
THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT WE CAN

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:42.347
START HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS

02:13:42.414 --> 02:13:44.383
BUT WE MADE A PROMISE TO THE

02:13:44.449 --> 02:13:45.183
STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY THAT WE

02:13:45.250 --> 02:13:47.052
WERE GOING TO POLITICIZE. ON A

02:13:47.119 --> 02:13:50.155
DETAIL MAN REVIEW IN THAT MANNER

02:13:50.222 --> 02:13:51.990
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE MADE

02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:53.892
THAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:54.793
PRUDENT DECISION AT THIS TIME.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.461
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT CAN'T
