MUNICIPALLY OWNED GOLF COURSES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OPEN SPACE. ABOUT WE NOW HAVE- REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT NUMBERS AND THIS CYCLE ARE VERY SCARY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WHERE THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL SPACE TO BUILD. WE HAVE DONE THE CONVERSIONS WE HAVE SPLIT THE LOTS- WE HAVE BUILT UP WHERE WE COULD- AND BROWNFIELDS AND GOLF COURSES ARE SOME OF THE ONLY PLACES WE HAVE LEFT OUR GOLF COURSES SUBSIDIZED BY THE TAXPAYERS- BUT WE HAVE A SMALL BUDGET AND SO THE REALITIES OF OURSELVES WE CAN DO THIS WITHOUT- ADDITIONAL HELP AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE. THIS HELPS. OUT THERE. I'M NOT AN ATTACK ON A GOLF BUT RATHER JUST GIVING AGENCIES AND OTHER TOOL. TO THINK OUTSIDE THE FULL BOX- TO TRY TO ADDRESS BOTH NEEDS OF HEALTH IN AN OPEN SPACE. OUT THERE WHEN IF IT'S THEIR COMMUNITY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS NOT THAT ALL COMMUNITIES AND RESPECTFUL OF THAT AND JUST TRYING TO CREATE. I THINK A MODEST PROGRAM IN THE TOOL KIT AS HE TRIED TO YOU KNOW ADDRESS OUR HOUSING ISSUES ACROSS.

GROUP FOR ORANGE COUNTY- AND WE ARE REALLY FACED WITH THE SAME- TYPE OF CONSTRAINTS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHE IS COMMUNITY IS AS WELL- WE HAVE CITIES THAT HAVE- YOU KNOW LARGELY THINK OF THEMSELVES AS BILLS OUCH DON'T HAVE- THE SITES TO ACCOMMODATE THE RENO PARTICULARLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND YET HERE WE HAVE A GREAT RESOURCE IN PUBLICLY OWNED LANDS- WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND REDUCE THE COST. PER DOOR IS TO USE CITY ON SITE. I ANOTHER BALLPARK MAKE FOR GREAT OPPORTUNITIES AS THAT THEIR LARGE PARCELS AND SO WE CAN INTEGRATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE LARGER HOUSING AND OPEN SPACE PLANS TO CREATE NEW COMMUNITIES AND NEW NEIGHBORHOODS- RIGHT NOW CITIES ARE OFTEN LEFT WITH YOU KNOW SORT OF THE REMNANT PARCELS IN AN INDUSTRIAL DOWN THAT ARE AWAY FROM. OUR EXISTING RESIDENTIAL AREAS BUT ALL COURSES IN CITIES THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE EDEVELOPED REALLY PROVIDE. AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE- YOU KNOW MIXED USE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCEPTING NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING RETAIL- OPEN SPACE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PLANNING THAT MUST BE DONE TO GET COMMUNITY BUY IN AND SUPPORT. AND SO THE GRANT PROGRAM LIKE BATES COULD ENABLE A CITY WHO'S LOOKING TO AGAIN VOLUNTARILY- HAVE A LOOK AT REDEVELOPING YOUR CALL COURTS TO HELP PAY FOR THINGS LIKE. RENDERING THE PIE SERVED AS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER IN MY OWN CITY FOR THREE YEARS. AND I KNOW THAT THE PROJECT BUT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS THE MOST DIFFICULTY MOVING FORWARD ARE THE ONES FOR WHICH FOLKS FELT. THEY EITHER DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT OR THEY WEREN'T INFORMED AND THIS PROGRAM WOULD REALLY HELP EASE THE BUDGET. FOR A CITY THAT WANTED TO CONSIDER- PURSUING A PROJECT LIKE THIS. AND LAUGHING JUST THAT WE WERE HAVE ASK OURSELVES WE WANT TO GIVE OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES. WE WANT PUBLIC LAND TO BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE AN EXPENSIVE HOBBY OF A FEW PEOPLE. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN A TOWN OF LESS THEIR GOLFERS DON'T GET ACCESS TO THIS OPEN SPACE. OR DO WE WANT TO USE. OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES TO PROVIDE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY PEOPLE. INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SHUT OUT OF OPPORTUNITY COMMUNITIES- AND THAT THESE GOLF COURSES REALLY DO OPTION.

ABUNDANT HOUSING LA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB SIX SEVEN TWO. AB SIX SEVEN THROUGH THE PROVIDE GRANTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENTER INTO DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT PUBLICLY ON GOLF COURSE ISN'T A HOUSING PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE OPEN SPACE WITH AT LEAST 25% OF THE NEW HOMES NEEDING TO BE AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- AT LEAST 15% OF THE DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE TO BE PRESERVED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE OPEN SPACE. I KNOW MORE THAN THAN A THIRD OF THE DEVELOPMENT COULD BE FOR NON RESIDENTIAL USE. OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO GRAPPLE WITH THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS SB SIX SEVEN TWO ADDRESSES TWO KEY STRATEGIES TO STABILIZE HOME PRICES FIRSTLY IT WOULD INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF MARKET RATE HOMES WITH NO DISPLACEMENT OF EXISTING RESIDENTS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON HOUSING PRICES. SECONDLY IT WOULD INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF INCOME RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO PROVIDE MORE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS LOCAL DECLINES IN POPULARITY AB SIX SEVENTY TWO CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROMOTE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS THAT BRING US CLOSER TO THE GOALS OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. AND APPROVED ACCESS TO TRULY PUBLIC OPEN SPACE BE RESPECTFUL BUT YOU pTHANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BOSER APPROACHES MOVING ALONG- BUT WE WILL HAVE OUR OPPOSITION THE SECOND BUT I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM. SO. MR MACDONELL.ADWARE THERE. I RECORD HERE LACKEY. WACKY HERE BLOOM. BOOM HERE IN ORDER. BOERNER HORVATH HERE RAMOS THREE OF US ROBERT RIVAS ABOUT YELP YELP HAVE A QUORUM I WOULD LIKE TO GO ON WITH THEIR OPPOSITION TO AB SIX SEVENTY TWO- I'M LOOKING FOR JOE HOUSTON OR CRAIG KESSLER PLEASE. HELLO THIS IS JOE HOUSTON WELCOME- CHAIRPERSON AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT MY NAME IS JOE HOUSTON HI I'M THE CEO OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GOLF ASSOCIATION AND WHILE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BILL WHICH SINGLED OUT PUBLIC GOLF COURSES. THAT THEY PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO OUR COMMUNITIES OUR ORGANIZATION HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OUR FOUNDATION YOUTH ON COURSE HAS THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND YOUTH MEMBERS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE AND WE ALSO PLAY A ROLE TO SUPPORT THE ENTIRE INTEREST OF THE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION GOLFERS IN CALIFORNIA. I ORGANIZATIONS VISION IS TO ENSURE THE GAME IS INCLUSIVE AND ACCEPTABLE AND ALSO TO PROVIDE LIFE CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DESERVING YOUTH. EXISTENCE THE PUBLIC MUNICIPAL GOLF COURSES ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO OUR EFFORTS. TODAY I WANT TO PROVIDE THREE QUICK POINTS. FIRST GOLF PROVIDES TREMENDOUS VALUE TO OUR SOCIETY INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE GAME OF GOLF IS REALLY UNIQUE IN THE VALUES AND LEFT OF THAT IMPRESSES UPON PEOPLE WHAT OTHER SPORT HAVE THE PLAYER CALL PENALTY ON THEMSELVES. GOLF REWARD THE VALUE OF HARD WORK AND ABILITY RECOVER FROM MISTAKES AND TEACH A GREAT RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT TO LEAVE THE COURSE BETTER THAN YOU FOUND IT. ALL THESE SKILLS TRANSCEND THE GAME AND THEY PLAYED A LIFE IN GENERAL. IT THE GAME OF GOLF ALSO PROVIDE THE PLATFORM TO GIVE BACK WHERE MANY OF OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES PROVIDE. A FOUNDATION TO HELP RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR LOCAL CHARITIES. SECOND OF ALL THE GAME OF GOLF IS GROWING. NOW IF YOU'RE A GOLFER YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MUCH HARDER TO GET IT AT TEATIME AT A PUBLIC GOLF COURSE THE LAST TWO YEARS AND THAT'S BECAUSE AROUND UP. ARE UP IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PERCENT. YOUTH ON COURSE ROUNDS HAVE DOUBLED IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HELP SUBSIDIZE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ROUNDS FOR DESERVING KIDS. AND THEY HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO SOCIALIZE AND LEARN THE VALUES OF THE GAME THAT HELP THEM IN THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AND THEY DO THIS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND WITH SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE. TO THIS IS NOT TIME TO INCENTIVIZE THE CLOSURE OF GOLF. IN THIRD ISN'T IT DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE GAME HAVE CHANGED THEY'VE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER. IT'S VERY EVIDENT IF YOU LOOK AND YOU GO TO A PUBLIC GOLF COURSE AND IT'S EVEN MORE EVIDENT WHEN YOU LOOK AT JUNIOR GOLFERS. OUR DATA SHOWS THAT THE GAME OF GOLF IS GROWING FASTEST AMONGST PEOPLE OF COLOR. JUNIORS AND WOMEN. YOUTH ON COURSE TO HELP DRIVE THE CENTER AND T. G. A. REACH PROGRAM THAT'S NEW HELPS PROVIDE GRANTS TO PUBLIC COURSES TO HELP PROMOTE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. THERE'S A LOT OF MOMENTUM IN THIS AREA AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. AND CLOSELY INVOLVED I WANT THE OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH OTHER ORGANIZATION PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE- CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR GOLF INCLUDE THE FPGA GOLF COURSE OWNERS SUPERINTENDENTS. AND-OTHER INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS. WHO ALL STAND UNITED IN THE PROPOSITION AND I'VE BEEN INFORMED ALSO THAT THERE'S AT LEAST TWELVE ORGANIZATION LETTERS OF OPPOSITION THAT WEREN'T. INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT THAT INCLUDED SOME REPRESENTATIONS FROM. LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN ONE ASIAN AMERICANS AND- FILIPINO GOLF CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND WE DO HOPE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE ALSO HEARD. SO WE BELIEVE THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO INCENTIVIZE THE CLOSURE OF GOLF COURSES AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NEXUS CRAIG KESSLER I BELIEVE. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON- GREG KESSLER REPRESENTING THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOLF ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE ALSO ALLIED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING OUR OUR FRIENDS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE CALIFORNIA WATCH FOOTBALL I'M IN ADDRESSING VERY SPECIFIC THINGS. FIRST WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING LAW NO WE'RE IN THIS DISCUSSION FROM THE AUTHOR OR THAT ALISON IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE CONVERSION OF PUBLICLY ON GOLF COURSES THE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AS ENVISIONED BY AB SIX SEVENTY TWO WOULD VIOLATE THE PARK PRESERVATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE WHICH IS ONLY THREE YEARS YOUNGER SURPLUS LAND ACT. THAT'S PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE CHAPTER TWO POINT FIVE IT'S VERY LIKELY THE LEAD TO YEARS OF LITIGATION WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL LIKELY RESULT EXPECTED NULLIFICATION OF EIGHTY SIX SEVENTY TWO. THE REASON THAT THE STAFF ANALYSIS POSITS THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NOT SUBSTANTIAL PRECEDENT FOR CONVERSION OF GOLF COURSES TO OTHER USES IS PRECISELY BECAUSE THE PRODUCT PRESERVATION ACT HAS BEEN HAS BEEN SEEN AS A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF DOING THAT SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. WITH RESPECT TO FISCAL SPOKE BACK THE MOST RECENT DRAFT OF THE BILL WAS DROPPED A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PRICE TAG TO THE PRIOR SEPTEMBER NINTH STRAPPED AS NOW% DRAFTED THE BILL GIVES NO IDEA OF THE SCOPE OF THE BILL'S INTENTIONS. THIS IS WE I MIGHT ADD MANY OF THE MUNICIPALITIES ALONG IS GOLF COURSES THANK LIKELY THE PARK PRESERVATION ACT APPLIES ANY PROCEEDS FROM HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS BASIC MORE THAN EATEN UP BY THE PARK PRESERVATION ACT REQUIREMENT. THAT PROCEEDS OF THE TRANSACTION BE USED TO ACQUIRE SUBSTITUTE PARK LAND FACILITIES FOR USE AS THE AXE STATE QUOTE BY GENERALLY TE SAME PERSON HE USED EXISTING PARK LAND AND FACILITIES ALTHOUGH MANY AND OFTEN VERY INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN THAT A RECREATIONAL USE OTHER THAN GOLF SATISFIES THE REQUIREMENTS. COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS DOES NOT IN OTHER WORDS A GOLF COURSE HAS BEEN MANY HAVE CAN BE CHANGED INTO ANOTHER RECREATIONAL. USE THIS BILL THAT YOU PROPOSED THAT HUNDRED CURRENT LAW. RICHEST TO THE ACT OF PERFORMANCE OF THE GOD IN WHICH- THE AUTHOR STATES THE NATIONAL GUARD FOUNDATION. TO SIX TO THAT SIX INVOLVED A DECLINING. THIS IS JUST FLAT NOT TRUE IN THIS THIS THEIR MATERIALS PICK DATA CON. THE SUCCESS- PRECISE OPTED OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN PUTTING OUT FOR YEARS NATIONAL GOLF FOUNDATION YESTERDAY SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE. THAT PROVIDES DATA EVIDENCE IF YOU WILL BUT THE FACT THE GOLF NATIONALLY HAS GROWN EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND XCELERATED PACE IN THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS. AGAIN I WOULD AGREE WITH JOE AT ONE PLACE OFF THE OFFICE DISTRICT NUMBERS NAY WITH IT YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS SECURING A TEE TIME. WITH RESPECT THE JOBS HOUSING IMBALANCE IS DUSTY POPULATED URBAN. AREAS THE AUTHOR STATES THAT. THE IDEAL SIZE FOR COME WITH THE URBAN AIR SO THEY CAN GET IN. AND WE'RE OF NEARBY RESIDENTS ARE LIMITED OPEN SPACE. ABOUT THE SPECIFICATION OF GOLF COURSES QUALIFYING CREEPY SIX SEVENTY TWO CONVERSION MUST BE LOCATED IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE ACT IN ITS LATEST ITERATION. IS TRANSLITERATION THEY CAN BE LOCATED ANYWHERE THE BILL LET'S START OUT OF THE SAPPER HOUSING SHORTAGE ALL OF KNOWLEDGE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES EXECUTE THIS. IS NOW ANYTHING BUT THAT. IN WRAPPING UP A CONCLUDING THIS RUSH TO YOUR BILL IS RIDDLED WITH FALSE PROMISES IT OPEN ENDED COMMITMENTS IN INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS IT CREATES MYRIAD PROBLEMS PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO OPEN SPACE IN THOSE PRECISELY THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LONG BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PARK FOR ESTABLISHING A OTHER SPECIALIZED RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS ANY ACTIVE RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY BOB IS ONE OF THEM SO WAS BASEBALL STORES A QUESTION SAYS SO IS PUBLIC SWIMMING POOL SO WITH EVERY ALMOST EVERY PARK LAND FUNCTION EXCEPT CLEAR OPEN SPACE. THEY'RE ALL USED BY ASKING LIMITED PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND GOLF IS GOLF IS ACTUALLY MORE HIGHLY UTILIZED ANY OF THE OTHERS FINISHES WANTED EVERYONE REPORT SO THIS IS THIS PROVIDED VERY LITTLE THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IT PURPORTS TO SOLVE REPORTS TO SOLVE.

SO I'M NOT NECESSARILY A QUESTION BUT A COMMENT IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR YES ALL RIGHT. SO I SPENT THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS ENSURING GOLF COURSES. AND DEVELOPERS SO HERE IS MY PERSONAL OPINION AS AN INDUSTRY EXPERT WELL WAIT A MINUTE COMMA. AT LEAST I THINK I'M AN INDUSTRY EXPERT OKAY. SO HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IN THIS BILL I GREATLY RESPECT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA I KNOW YOUR INTENT IT IS PURE IT IS GOOD BUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OUR THIS. SO YOU GOTTA TAKE A GOLF COURSE. AND A DEVELOPER WILL BE WORKING TO DEAL. WITH THE GOLF COURSE IN ORDER TO PURCHASE 60% OF IT. OKAY AND THE 25% THAT SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUSIONARY ZONING FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE BACK OF THE BUS THEY'RE GONNA BE STACKED UP WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A VIEW OF THE GOLF COURSE AND- THE RICH PEOPLE. MULTI MILLIONAIRES WILL BE ON THE GOLF COURSE. OKAY I'D LIKE TO JOIN A GROUP BUT THEN I DON'T THINK I QUALIFY. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SIXTY FORTY HERE. THE OTHER THING IS. YOU'LL LOSE. 30% OF YOUR GOLF COURSES BASICALLY BECAUSE THERE'S MANY GOLF COURSES BECAUSE OF INSURED ON THAT ARE GOING BROKE OR AREN'T IN GOOD SHAPE OR FOR WHATEVER REASON MANY TIMES THE GOLF COURSES OWNED BY A FAMILY AND THE MATRIARCH OF THE FAMILY DIES AND THE KIDS JUST WANT THE MONEY GOLF COURSES HERE SO THE REASON MY COLLEAGUES YOU'RE HEARING THIS OPPOSITION IS THEY EITHER SENSE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN COMMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND TO GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN FOR ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF- OF HEARINGS- I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL- BUT I'M DOING SO VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND I'M RESERVING MY RIGHT TO VOTE AGAINST IT WHEN IT- IF AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR- I THINK. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONCERN I HAVE IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE PICKING THE WINNERS AND LOSERS HERE FLAG OFF COURSES AND WHY NOT BSEBALL DIAMONDS AND SOCCER FIELDS AND ONE OF THE SPEAKERS. MENTIONED EQUESTRIAN USES- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT A GOLF COURSE- AS A RECREATIONAL USE AS OPEN SPACE- COMPARED TO SOME OF THOSE OTHER. USES I DO UNDERSTAND- THE NEED. TO IDENTIFY PLACES WHERE WE CAN BUILD HOUSING AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY PRESSING AND IMPORTANT NEED AND I'VE- PROBABLY GONNA HAVE SOME LEGISLATION ON MY OWN ON THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A PROPOSAL OR TO- IN IN MY DISTRICT. TO CONVERT. OF A SOME UNDER UTILIZED TO- PROPERTIES TO- HOUSING AND PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING- FIVE I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT THIS- IS LOCALLY FOCUSED IT'S UP TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BUT I THINK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL MAKES A GOOD POINT IN SAYING THAT- ULTIMATELY IF WE OPEN UP THE STORE DEVELOPERS WILL START TO- DRIVE THE PROCESS AND YOU KNOW IDENTIFY SPACES WHERE THEY THINK THEY CAN BENEFIT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN FIND A WAY TO- AT ACHIEVE SOME ADDITIONAL REVENUE AND I JUST. QUESTION IF WE WANT TO OPEN UP THAT PANDORA'S BOX AND- OPEN UP THESE- FOR THE MOST PART WHILE PRESERVING BUT BY THE WAY I DON'T HAVE ANY GOLF COURSES- NOT THE CITY I LIVE AND- OF. PUBLIC GOLF COURSES IN THE CITY I LIVE IN AND I THINK IN MY AN ENTIRE DISTRICT WHICH MIGHT SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE- I DO HAVE A LOT OF OUT OF IT- PRIVATE YOU. EXCUSE ME PUBLIC USE GOLFERS- AND I THINK I HEARD FROM BOTH OF THEM OFF WHEN THAT PARTICULARLY WHEN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE FILM WAS- WHAT WAS BEING DISCUSSED PUBLICLY- THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN OUT THERE- IN THE GOLFER WORLD AND CALL FOR WORLD MAY. BE YOU KNOW A RELATIVE MINORITY IN THE OVERALL- SPORTS AREA BUT- I DON'T SEE WHY THAT MEANS THE- GOLF COURSES SHOULD HAVE ANY LESS PROTECTION WERE A BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THANK YOU SO EVER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE SEEING NONE THAT IS OUR MOTION. RULERS THE SECOND ONE KERRIER MOTION THE SECOND AND THEN- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES I WANT TO VERIFY FOR THE RECORD THING THAT I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MET- MEN MEN THANK YOU SHAPE THE COMMITTEES HELP ON THIS- I HAVE SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF BELL GARDENS ONE BASEBALL FIELD AND ONE MANY MANY ACRES GOLF PERSON BUNCH OF BROWNFIELDS I WEALTHY WORKING TO TRY TO CLEAN UP AND CONVERT TO BETTER USE. OUT THERE ARE AND IT DOES NOT FROM COMMUNITIES IT'S FOR COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A DISCUSSION IF IT'S FOR THEM- IT'S MODEST IT'S FOR COMMUNITIES TO SOMETIMES ON HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ENGAGE IN THE DISCUSSION WITH THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS OUT THERE. I HAVE. GOOGLE FOR CORE WITHIN A MILE OF EACH OTHER ON THE SAME STREET ACTUALLY IN ONE- IS NOT SUBSIDIZED THEY'RE BOTH PUBLICLY ON ONE- MAKE A PROFIT AND THE OTHER ONE IS DEFINITELY VERY MUCH OF THE DAY IF AND I THINK WHEN WE HAVE SITUATIONS LIKE THAT MAYBE WE COULD START THINKING ABOUT. ABOUT THAT YOU STILL HAVE A SPACE TO ALLOW GOLFERS TO PLAY THEN MAYBE WE COULD ALSO TRY SOMETHING ELSE AND SO- IT'S MODESTUS ONE TOOL IN THE- TOOL KIT I LOOK FORWARD TO ALL OF BILLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ON HOUSING THIS YEAR. OUT THEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S SEE HERE- I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA THANK YOU FOR. WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE THE YOU CHANGE THE BILL FROM A MANDATE. TO AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM. WHICH ALLEVIATES THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THIS AUTHORITIES APPROPRIATE FOR EVERY CHIP JURISDICTION. AS WE KNOW SOME CITIES AND COUNTIES MAY SEE THIS IS AN ATTRACTIVE WAY TO DEVELOP NEW HOUSING. WITH YOUR EFFORTS THOSE CITIES COUNCILS AND- COUNTY BOARDS CAN WEIGH THE INTEREST OF THE RESIDENTS IN DECIDING WHETHER THIS IS A VERY. USEFUL TOOL. I ENCOURAGE YOU. TO HAVE STAFF CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A CD REGARDING POTENTIAL OVERLAP WITH THE SIR PLAN. SURPLUS LANDS ACT. AS YOUR BILL MOVES FORWARD. WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY. OF THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE AGUIAR-CURRY HI. AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY. LACKEY NOW BLOOM. BLOOM HI BOERNER HORVATH. RAMOS THREE OF US THREE OF US HI ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS I VOEPEL YEAH I'M SORRY AS RUSSIAN WILL IT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPENER FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO- A BEAST. SIX THIRTY TWO- SO SHOULD I DO NEXT. YEAH WHAT DO SIX CITY TO BLOOM. YOU. KNOW WE. YOU CAN BE THANK YOU AND A GOOD MORE AGAIN A GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN THAT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. SIX EIGHTY TO A MEASURE TO INCENTIVIZE CO HOUSING APARTMENTS AND ALSO PLEASE TO ACCEPT- THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OF THANKS COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK ON THIS BILL. A CO HOUSING ALSO KNOWN AS COMMUNAL LIVING IS TYPICALLY MADE UP OF UNITS THAT ARE SMALLER THAN FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE FEET- AND THEY ALSO TYPICALLY OFFER A SHARED KITCHEN AND DINING AREA SOMETIMES OTHER- I SHARED AMENITIES- AND THEY ARE AGAIN TYPICALLY MORE AFFORDABLE THAN THE AVERAGE STUDIO OR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS- IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE AVERAGE RENT IS- WELL OVER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH- A DEVELOPMENT COMPANY KNOWN AS STAR CITY BUILT CO HOUSING UNITS. AVERAGING TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET AND RENTED THEM FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH LESS THAN HALF OF THE CITY'S AVERAGE RENT. THESE NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE IDEAL FOR THOSE WHO DON'T QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BUT- CANNOT COMPETE FOR MARKET RATE APARTMENTS. WHAT WE REFER TO AS THE MISSING METAL. THE CO HOUSING MODEL CAN ALSO BE USED TO HOUSE SENIORS AND FORMERLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SINCE COMMUNAL LIVING PROVIDES A UNIQUE MIX OF BOTH PRIVACY AND THE ABILITY FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT. UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL RESTRICTIONS THAT REQUIRE A MINIMUM UNIT SIZE OR A MAXIMUM DENSITY HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO BUILD COAL HOUSING APARTMENTS. AB SIX EIGHTY TWO WILL ALLOW CO HOUSING PROJECTS TO QUALIFY FOR INCENTIVES UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS LAW AND HELP MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF UNITS WITHIN AN ALREADY COSTLY PARCEL OF LAND. THE MEASURE WILL REQUIRE DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE UNITS IN EXCHANGE FOR CONCESSIONS AND INCENTIVES SUCH AS INCREASED DENSITY. AB SIX EIGHTY TWO WILL HELP DIVERSIFY THE HOUSING STOCK. OFFERING BOTH NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE OPTIONS FOR COMMUNAL LIVING. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS JANE BLUMENFELD A SENIOR FELLOW AT UCLA'S CITYLAB. OKAY WELCOME- JAMES BLOOM BLUMENFELD. YEAH WELCOME THANK YOU HAVE A CHAIR NEXT THANK YOU HAVE A NO YES I THINK SO YEAH MY NAME IS JANE BLUMENFELD IN A FELLOW THAT- CITY LED UCLA. CITY LAB UCLA IS PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY SIX EIGHTY TWO AND WE THANK THE ASSEMBLY MAN FOR HIS EFFORTS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. HELLO WELL DOCUMENTED HOUSING CRISIS REQUIRES MANY SELECTIONS THERE IS NOT A SINGLE FIX WE ALL AGREE ON THAT. THE STATE NEEDS SOLUTIONS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND WE NEED A VARIETY OF HOUSING TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE AFFORD TO BLINK AND BE PROFITABLE ENOUGH SO THAT PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS OF BUILDING HOUSING WILL ACTUALLY BUILD. AB SIXTY TO CREATE A NEW HELPING TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS NOT BEEN LEGAL FOR MANY REASONS. DOWNING AND OTHERWISE. AB SIXTY TWO WILL ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO BUILD CO HOUSING APARTMENT BUILDINGS. THAT COMPLY WITH LOCAL HI GLORIA SETBACK REQUIREMENTS. BUT TO GIVE DEVELOPERS THE ABILITY TO BUILD SMALLER UNITS THAT INCLUDE A BATHROOM SINK REFRIGERATOR MICROWAVE. KITCHENS AND DINING SPACES WILL BE SHARED AMONG THE RESIDENTS- HELPING BUILDINGS CAN BE LOW RISE ARE HIGH RISE. WHICH SPEAKS TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY. IT SIXTY TWO A REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR SENIORS BECAUSE KITCHEN ARE HAS FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE COMMUNAL DINING TOLD REPORTERS ON NEED FOR THEM AND THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO HOUSING THAT IS EVEN REMOTELY AFFORDABLE FOR SENIORS OTHER THAN INCOME RESTRICTED HOUSING. THIS TYPE OF GIRL HOUSING AUTHORITY ATTRACTED TO STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEARLY IN THE JOB MARKET WHO ARE WILLING TO SHARE CONTENT IN EXCHANGE FOR LEICESTER. ASSEMBLY THAT NUMBER BALLOONED THAT MENTIONED THE STARKEY PROJECT IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT IS BUILT ON THE EXACTLY TO THE SPECIFICATIONS OF AB SIX EIGHTY TWO. AND THE ONE THING I WOULD ADD ABOUT THAT PROJECT WAS WHEN IT FIRST OPENED THE BILL THE BUILDING WE STEP IMMEDIATELY AND HAD A WAITING LIST OF EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING. CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE POPULATION RECORDS HOUSING UNITS THAT CAN MEET DIFFERENT NEEDS. FOR SENIORS YOUNG PEOPLE DIDN'T CO HELPING OFFERS THE RIGHT BALANCE OF PRACTICING AFFORDABILITY AND COMMUNITY. AT SEKALI. I THOUGHT MISS BERMAN FILLED- I DO NOT SEE ANYONE ON OPPOSITION TO SPEAK ON THE BILL IS THERE ANYONE HERE IN THE AUDITORIUM. I WOULD LIKE T SPEAK OF THEM OPPOSITION OKAY SING NINE WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND IN OPPOSITION- YOU ARE US HIS ME OPERATOR- WE CAN HAVE THOSE COME IN I WANT THEM JUST TO STATE THEIR NAME THE ORGANIZATION AND THE POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY. I WILL TAKE BOTH SUPPORT FOR AND OR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU TO STATE YOUR POSITION ON THIS BILL A. B. SIX EIGHTY TWO. PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO USING YOUR TELEPHONE. KEYPAD AGAIN THAT'S ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. WE DO HAVE TWO LINES IN Q. WE'LL GO FIRST TO LINE THIRTY SIX THREE SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

FOR ADDING A THIRD BEDROOM WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE CITIES IS THAT JUST IRRELEVANT FOR THEM OR IS THAT EXPERTS IN THE BILL THAT THEY'RE EXCLUDED FROM THAT PART OF THE PROVISION SO WE'RE FINDING WE INTRODUCED THROUGH MADAM. AT THE END OF THIS BILLS WERE FINDING SOME DRASTIC. OF INSTANCE LIKE OUT IN BURKE THEY HAVE. HAD THESE ORDINANCES THAT THEY WERE CREATING OUT FOR SOMEBODY JUST WANTING TO BUILD AN ADDITIONAL BEDROOM ONTO THEIR EXISTING HOUSE. RIGHT AND THEN THE WHOLE HEIGHT REQUIREMENT O THAT WE SAID OKAY WELL. ONLY IF IT'S A TWO STORY BUILDING ALREADY IF YOUR HOME IS ALREADY TWO STORIES. AND WALAU THAT TOO SO WE GOT AROUND THAT. SO MY WHOLE THING WAS YOU KNOW LIKE IF PEOPLE ARE TO. WEATHER SAY YOU EXPANDED YOUR FAMILY ARE YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IN AND LAW. OR MAYBE NOW BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT YOU'RE TAKING AN- ADDITIONAL FAMILY MEMBER BECAUSE OF OTHER HEALTH. HEALTH THE- HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT ABILITY TO DO THAT TO YOUR OWN HOME. AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS LEGISLATION IS AIMED AT TO ALLOW THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR HOMEOWNERS. TO BUILD OUT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH. A HUGE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS SO FOR INSTANCE LIKE BERKELEY AND SOME OTHERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE- PUTTING IN THESE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS. WRITING WE KNOW. YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE POLITICS AROUND THAT BUT WE JUST WANT TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO DO THAT WITH THEIR OWN HOMES. HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY. AND SO WE DON'T WANT THAT TO TRIGGER. YOU KNOW.

IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THERE IS A COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTED FOUR TO ONE TO ADOPT THE SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT MAP. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ROUND OF REDISTRICTING THAT FRACTURES THE LATINO COMMUNITY IN THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE DILUTING THE COMMUNITIES VOTING POWER IN THEIR CAPACITY TO ELECT REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR CHOICE.

AND THERE ARE MANY PROHIBITIONS AS WELL THAT ARE ALSO OUTLINED WITHIN THE BILL AND THE ANALYSIS. VERY WELL MAY I MAKE MY COMMENT YOU MAY THESE ARE NOT ELECTED PEOPLE THEY'RE NOT. AND MY MAIN CONCERN IS. ANY NINE RULE THAT'S NOT OUT OF FOURTEEN SEVEN OR SEVEN WORK AND HANG UP OR ANYTHING ELSE SO IT'S A STACKED DECK OF CARDS FOR RIVERSIDE- THE FOR. NONE POLITICAL PEOPLE N. P. P. AND THIRD PARTY. FOUR COMMISSIONERS THEY'LL BE CHERRY PICKED. SO. IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A REPUBLICAN. WHICH I HAPPEN TO BE. YOU'RE DEAD THIS IS A STACKED DECK THIS IS JUST SIMPLY. SETTING IT UP TO BE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED. FIVE YEAH WHOEVER ANYWAY THAT'S MY COMMENT- I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT THAT SOME OF US WERE AWAKE. IF I COULD RESPOND MADDON CHAIR YOU SURE CAN SO THE OPERATION OF THE COMMISSION NINE COMMISSIONERS CONSTITUTE A QUORUM. NINE VOTES ARE REQUIRED TO PASS ANY MOTION BY THE COMMISSION UNLIKE THE STATE REDISTRICTING COMMISSION THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT ABOUT THE PARTISAN MAKEUP OF AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE SO THE VOTE REQUIREMENT IS ONLY NINE COMMISSIONERS WITH NO CONSIDERATION OF THE PARTISANSHIP.
