THAT I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT WERE LIVING IN I'M PRESIDENT TIMES WITH WILDFIRES HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF WILDFIRES IN THE STATE THEY'VE CHANGED THEIR LARGER THEY'RE MORE DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY ARE NOW MORE THAN ANY OTHER TIME IN MODERN HISTORY NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST THE NEW NORMALS HEARING HONESTLY THAT'S WHY WE NEED SB TWELVE WE KNOW THE TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS MUST CHANGE. WHAT IS ALWAYS WORK LIKE SIMPLY RELYING ON BUILDING MATERIALS TO WITHSTAND WILDFIRE NO LONGER WORKS IN THIS ERA OF MEGA FIRES THIS IS WHAT OUR NEW NORMAL LOOKS LIKE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN HOMEOWNER PAYOUTS AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRES DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA TWENTY SIX BILLION INSURANCE PAYOUTS ANY NORMAL MEANS IN THE LAST SIXTY YEARS CALIFORNIA WAS BURNING- HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES TODAY WE'RE NOW BERNIE NEARLY TWO MILLION EVERY YEAR AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT DECADE. THE NEW NORMAL MEANS ALMOST ALL THE LAND BERNIE NOW IS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS WHERE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE THE NEW NORMAL MEANS THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS INTERVENING WITH LAWSUITS ON TWO MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE BECAUSE AN INADEQUACY OF FIRE SAFETY REVIEW IN THE THIRD SEPARATE LAWSUIT FOUND A LARGE DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAD INADEQUATE WILDFIRE SAFETY ASSESSMENT I SAY THAT NOT THROWING STONES BUT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE FACTS THAT ARE AT HAND. THE EVIDENCE IS IN OUR KERR JOINT PERMITTING PROCESS. IN THIS ERA ARE STARTING TO PUT RESIDENTS IN HARM'S WAY. BUT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES WERE EVEN INCENTIVIZING NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN AREAS THAT HAVE ALREADY BURNED. INTO WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT THIS BILL ACTS RATIONALLY. WE ALREADY IMPLEMENT SAFETY STANDARDS WHERE WE BUILD WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH FLOOD RISK ZONES. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED BUILDING STANDARDS ON EARTHQUAKE ZONES IN YOUR FAULT LINES. IN RECENT YEARS WILDFIRES HAVE KILLED MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS COMBINED AND THE RISK CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY YEAR AFTER YEAR. SB TWELVE IS PART OF THE BLUEPRINT FOR FIRE SAFE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WHICH WOULD ENSURE CITIES AND COUNTIES CREEK FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS PRIOR TO PERMITTING DEVELOPMENT IN VERY HIGH RISK AREAS IT'S A BALANCING REASONABLE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE TO THE WILDFIRE EMERGENCY THAT IS ENGULFING IN ENDANGERING OUR COMMUNITIES. UNLIKE WHAT SOME MEMBERS HAVE SAID OR LIKE THE LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD THIS IS NOT AN OUTRIGHT MORATORIUM. SB TWELVE CENTS A MINIMUM FOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. ONLY IN THE HIGHEST VERY- HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES SO THERE'VE BEEN SOME CONFUSION THAT THIS WOULD TAKE IN MORE BUT IT'S AN ONLY THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK ZONE. CURRENT STATE STANDARDS ARE LIMITED TO THE BUILDING CODE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ROAD SIGNS IN FUEL BRICKS SB TWELVE SETS UP A TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS FOR THE STATE FARM MARSHALL TO ESTABLISH BOLD NEW STANDARDS THAT ENSURE DEVELOPMENTS AS A WHOLE ARE DESIGNED. TO WITHSTAND FIRE NOT JUST THE BUILDINGS WITHIN THOSE DEVELOPMENTS SO WHAT KIND OF STANDARDS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SO NUMBER ONE A WILDFIRE ASSESSMENT AND WHILE FOR HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN WOULD BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. LOCATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE IGNITION POTENTIAL AND AT THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF WATER SUPPLIES ESSENTIAL FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION DURING A WILDFIRE. THERE WOULD NOT OF THEIR NO LONGER BE DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF DEVELOPMENT ONE WAY IN AND ONE WAY OUT YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE INGRESS AND EGRESS DEFENSIBLE SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND FUEL MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. AND IN ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED FUNDED AND IMPLEMENTED TO VERIFY ONGOING COMPLIANCE IT WOULD BE BACK BY HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION FEES. BUT WE PUT. THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP SAVE LIVES. HOWEVER THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT STANDARDS BE REASONABLE. AND TO BE FEASIBLE. AND ACHIEVABLE FOR THE MAJORITY DEVELOPMENTS. THIS MEANS DESPITE WHAT SOME HAVE SAID S. B. TWELVE WILL NOT CREATE A BLANKET BAN ON NEW DEVELOPMENT. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THERE IS A PARALLEL EFFORT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. THEY CANDIDLY TAKES EIGHT MUCH MORE ROBUST APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS. SB TWELVE DOES NOT DO THAT. THESE STANDARDS WITHIN THIS BILL ARE TIERED TO THE STANDARDS GET INCREASINGLY STRONGER AS DEVELOPMENTS GET LARGER IN VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. IT'S STRUCTURED THIS WAY BECAUSE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS PUT MORE FOLKS INTO THOSE ZONES THIS MEANS THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE STRINGENT BUT- ARE NOT TOO COSTLY TO PREVENT DEVELOPMENT. NOW THANKS TO THE CHAIR IN TWO PREVIOUS CHAIRS WE'VE AMENDED THIS BILL AT SINCE THE LAST COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THAT THE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS ONLY APPLY TO RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS. NOT TO RETAIL NOT COMMERCIAL EXCEPT. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE HEARD THAT SECTION SEVENTEEN OF THIS BILL COULD IMPACT THE BORDER FORCE REACH REGULATORY AUTHORITY. AT WHICH WAS NOT OUR INTENTION TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL TO REMOVE THE LINE FROM THE PERIMETER. WE ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH AT THE COMMITTEES EXCELLENT- WELL I'M A CONSULTANT TO CREATE THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENTS WHICH I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO OVER. CLARIFY THAT THE FINDINGS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WAS MAKE TO APPROVE MINUTES PROJECT ARE NOT SEPTIC SEQUEL. NUMBER TWO LIMON OFFSITE IMPROVEMENTS FOR A SINGLE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND WE CLARIFY TECHNICAL- CHANGES RELATED TO FIRE SUBDIVISION MAPS. AND THE BOARD OF FORESTRY REGULATIONS. THIS ISTHE THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL. THIRD YEAR OF THIS BILL IN THIS LEGISLATURE. SINCE THIS BILL. WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED WE'VE HAD DOZENS OF CALIFORNIANS STUFF. TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL LOSSES IN THE SAME ZONES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADVANCING STANDARDS FOR. TOO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST SO JUST BE HONEST. TOO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST POLITICS HAVE GOTTEN THE WAY OF DATA. THE DATA SHOWS THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE BUILD IN THE WAY WE REBUILD IN CALIFORNIA. IF WE DON'T CANDIDLY WE NO MORE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WILL FOLLOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND YOU HAVE MY ASSURANCE MISTER CHAIRMAN DEVICE YOU'RE TO THE MEMBERS. THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. ON THIS BILL AND IF THERE ARE AREAS WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE THIS BILL. WILL SINCERELY DO SO SPEAKING IN SUPPORT WITH LAUREN DAVE WINFIELD ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND ERIN REID SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTERS. LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE- PLEASE I'M SO SORRY. CENTER STERN A POLICE THEY'RE STERN ALSO- IT WHO IS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL HI MISTER CHAIR IS ALSO HERE I APOLOGIZE SENATOR. APOLOGIES FOR THE- APOLOGIES FOR GETTING A YEARLY WITNESS HOPEFULLY- I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT AT MISTER CHAIR JUST APPRECIATE YOU TAKING A MOMENT ALL I WOULD SAY MEMBERS IS THAT I'M THE ONE WITH THE MARCH MORE AGGRESSIVE VERSION OF THIS LEGISLATION THAT WAS HELD IN THE SENATE- SB FIFTY FIVE- WE PUT FORWARD IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE AN ACTUAL BAR ON CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS- IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS WERE MET. AND I'M I'M- I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT EVEN AS IT'S BEEN AMENDED TODAY- PASSING WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT OF SB ONE EIGHTY TWO THAT PASSED WITH NEAR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT- COUPLE YEARS AGO. I JUST HOPE THIS LEGISLATURE REALIZES THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BACKWARDS I THINK THIS IS PRESERVING WHAT. THE GOVERNOR I WAS SITTING ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK A COUPLE YEARS AGO- AND PUTS A MINIMUM STANDARDS IN PLACE. BUT THE FACT IS IT'S INEQUITABLE. TO ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VERY HIGH END PROPERTIES IN VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES IN MY VIEW AND HAVE THAT BE SUBSIDIZED BY EVERYBODY ELSE THE CROSS SUBSIDY OF ALLOWING THE NEXT MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO MOVE INTO VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES ON EVERYBODY ELSE IS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS UNDER REASON STANFORD ANALYSIS AND THAT KIND OF SORT OF CROSS TRANSFER IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T ALWAYS APPRECIATE BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THOSE DEVELOPMENTS ARE AS- DURABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AS POSSIBLE AND WE'RE SEEING IT HAPPEN. OUT IN NEW HALL RANCH THEY'RE DOING THAT WORK THEY CLEARED THEIR SEQUEL PROCESS AND ARE BUILDING A DEVELOPMENT WITH PROPER HARDENING STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT'S THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN MAKE IT THROUGH- UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK I HAVE A MUCH MORE STRINGENT ATTITUDE ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT I WANT TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT THAT I THINK THAT CENTER REQUIRE A PLUG HIS DIPLOMACY IN THIS EFFORT AND I KNOW THESE ARE VERY TRICKY POLITICS AND THESE ARE HIGH STAKES RIGHT. THERE'S LITIGATION UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW AND THE CUT THERE'S A LOT OF SENSITIVITY THAT PENDING REGULATIONS BUT I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK THIS MEASURES A MODEST STEP FORWARD I THINK IT'S MUCH MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT I APPRECIATE YOU LETTING ME- WAY IN A LITTLE BIT OF SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN FIRES IN THEIR DISTRICTS SINCE I CAME INTO OFFICE LOS MY OWN PLACE AND TO GO HOME TO PLACES LIKE MALAGA IN CALABASAS AND SAY YOU GUYS HAVE TO DO BETTER. THAT'S THE REALLY HARD WORK IS TO GO HOME INTO THESE ZONES AND SAY- WE CAN ALL DO BETTER SO I HOPE-YOU'LL CONSIDER SUPPORTING DAY THANKS FOR LET ME TAKE A MOMENT THANK YOU CENTER LET'S NOT GO TO THE MAIN WITNESSES ON THE PHONE LINE- FROM THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND CAL FIRE- TO THE OPERATOR. THEIR LIVES ARE OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AREN'T ABLE ONE PAIR REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION VERY PLEASED TO BE PART OF SB TWELVE WHICH MAKES A NUMBER OF VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES REGARDING PLANNING FOR AND PERMITTING DEVELOPMENT AND VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. PLANNING FOR CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCY HAS BEEN TOP OF MIND IN THE PLANNING PROFESSION WILDFIRES ARE SERIOUS ISSUES FACING DEVELOPMENTS AND IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT BOLD NEW STUFF LIKE THOSE NOT THE TWELVE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO BETTER PREPARE OUR COMMUNITIES AND MORE RESILIENT WAY. POSSIBLY AS SENATOR MCGUIRE AND BETTER STERN HAS SAID WE ARE ALREADY FACING ANOTHER VERY CHALLENGING WILDFIRE SEASON- AND PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF RECORD DRY CONDITIONS EVEN AS WE SPEAK FIRES ARE LITERALLY BURNING THREE COMMUNITY IN RIGHT NOW. AND MAJOR MEDIA OUTLETS HAVE REPEATEDLY HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO PREPARE AND RETHINK HOW WE DEVELOP IN THESE AREAS THERE'S A NEW THIS MEANS RECAPPING HOW LAND USE PLANNING HAS BEEN DONE IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING EXISTING RUN OVER TO MY PHONE NUMBER. OF ALL THE ROLE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTING STRONGER BUILDING STANDARDS COORDINATING WITH STATE AGENCIES AND ENSURING THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SUPPORTED WITH GUIDANCE AND FUNDING TO MAKE IT CRITICAL CHANGES THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SB TWELVE MOBILE WHAT THE BILL WILL NOT DO IS BANNED ABOUT MEANT. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT BEFORE DOING SO IMPORTANT FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS NEED TO BE MET TO ENSURE ADEQUATE PROTECTION CAN BE PROVIDED THE BILL REQUIRED PLANNING UPDATES TO THE SAFETY AND LAND USE ELEMENT ALONG WITH WILDFIRE REDUCTION STANDARDS WILL ENSURE EXISTING HOME TO HARDEN NEW DEVELOPMENTS ARE THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDERED AND DEVELOPED WITH FEASIBLE STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MET TO PROTECT NOT JUST PROPERTY BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE'S LIVES. AND WE ARE FACING MOUNTING RISK FROM WILDFIRES IN COMMUNITIES WE ARE ALSO FACING OBVIOUSLY A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE BELIEVE SB TOLD THE COURT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING PRIORITIES BY ENCOURAGING MORE SUSTAINABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES AND APPROPRIATELY DESIGNING. COMMUNITIES AND VERY HIGH FIRE RISK. ALL OF THIS MORNING THE STATE HOUSING PRODUCTION. FOR EACH THREE JOIN THAT NEEDS OF THE- DOES NOT KEEP HOUSING FOR BEING THE- COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT HOW. BETTER PLANNING AND STANDARDS HAND HOW REDUCE ALL MOBILE OF NEED TO. APA CALIFORNIA PRE ALL UPPER. OF SENATOR MCGUIRE SENATOR STERN AS WELL AS THE LARGEST. AND THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS ON WELFARE MITIGATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY URGE MY VOTE THANK YOU. THREE MISTER REED ON. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ALLEN READ REPRESENTING CAL FIRE LOCAL TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE- FIRST ONE I THINK THE COMMITTEE- FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BUT- ALSO IMPORTANT AT SEVEN ACQUIRING TENER STERN HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR THE SAFETY OF FIREFIGHTERS- AND WE WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR EFFORTS IN THIS BILL- THERE'S MORE MORE PEOPLE MOVING INTO WHAT WE CALL THE WILD URBAN INTERFACE. A CALLED LOUIS ALL THE TIME AND IT MAKES IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FIGHTING FIRES WHEN THEY'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS TO PROTECT LIVES AND HOMES AND- SO SOMETIMES IT'S A IT'S A DISTRACTION PARTICULAR HOMES ARE NOT WELL BILL THEY'RE NOT FIRE RETARDANT- MATERIALS AND SO PLANNING IS IMPORTANT. AND. I THINK THAT BUT- FOR THE NEXT TWELVE IS SENSE BUT- IT SHOULD DONE A LONG TIME AGO- BUT HE NEARLY 25% OF OUR POPULATION IS IN THE LOUIS NOW. AND SO THAT'S A HUGE HUGE ISSUE FOR CAL FIRE AND I THINK CHOIR MENTIONED. MOST OF THE MOST SERIOUS FIRES IN OUR STATE HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED IN JUST THE LAST TEN YEARS- THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST. HUNDREDS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST. FIREFIGHTERS THE BLACK DEVILS IN THEIR LIVES AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP PROTECT EVERYBODY AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THAT- I'VE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT. THAT I GO OUT TO PARIS EVERY YEAR AND- I'VE NEVER SEEN IT I THOUGHT LAST YEAR WAS BAD AND I'M AFRAID THIS YEAR MAY BE WORSE. LAST YEAR- WE LOST OVER FOUR MILLION ACRES AND FORCED LOTS OF LICENSE AND- HOMES. SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO CLOSE ON ONE THING OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE WORKING TWENTY EIGHT DAYS STRAIGHT WITHOUT A DAY OFF. THEY GET ONE DAY OFF AND THEY HAVE TO GO BACK ON THE FIRE AGAIN FOR ANOTHER MONTH- IT'S- TERRIBLE CONDITIONS BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO REDUCE OUR FIRE EXPOSURES SB TWELVE IS JUST ONE STEP AND I KNOW MCGUIRE IS WORKING ON MANY OTHER ISSUES AS WELL INCLUDING ADDING MRE FIREFIGHTERS. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR IT LETTING ME TEXT BY THIS MORNING THANK. YOU FOR THIS AFTERNOON NOW. AT THIS TIME WHEN WE GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL- SMI SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE ROOM SCENE NOT- LET'S GO TO THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATIONS.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT SILVIO FOR OUR IN BEHALF THE CAIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION- UNFORTUNATELY CONTINI BE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO A BILL THAT. CONTINUES TO BE DESIGNATED AS A HOUSING KILLER- I'M JUST GOING TO FOCUS MY FEW MINUTES ON. WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN THIS BILL- I DON'T THINK THAT CENTER ACTUALLY GOT TO EXPLAIN IT BUT THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS TO DEAL WITH SEE WHAT. OUR VIEWERS ARE VERY LIMITED- SEQUIN MAINTENANCE AND THEY ONLY DEAL WITH HALF THE ISSUE. THOSE SEQUEL AMENDMENTS ARE SPECIFIC TO IF I WALK AND ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY PULL A PERMIT. THAT THAT ACTION DOES NOT TRIGGER SEQUEL AND IT MAINTAINS. ITS MINISTERIAL APPLICATION. NUMBER TWO WHAT IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC ABOUT THE SEQUEL PROVISION AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE C. QUIT CALLING. IT IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE WHAT WE CALL GRANDFATHERED. THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR CUT MOMENT IN TIME WHERE ONCE YOU HIT THIS POINT. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ASKED. OR HAVE THE GOAL POSTS MOVED ON YOU. THERE ARE INSTANCES IN VIRTUALLY EVERY PROJECT WHERE YOU GO OUT TO THE FIELD AND THERE ARE MINOR MODIFICATIONS. CHANGES TO THE PROJECT THAT ARE BASED ON REAL WORLD CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN YOUR OUT THERE IT COULD BE MOVING TO CURB CUT SIX INCHES CHANGING A ROADS LIGHTLY. READJUSTING WHAT COULD BE A RADII FOR- IN IMPROVE TRAFFIC FLOW WHATEVER IT IS. THOSE ARE MINOR MODIFICATIONS IN CONTEXT THE WHOLE PROJECT. THOSE THOSE MINOR CHANGES SHOULD NOT. RE TRIGGER NEW FIRE STANDARD WHICH RE TRIGGER SEQUEL. WE CANNOT HAVE A SO WE HAVE NOT DEALT WITH THE SEQUEL- IN REGARDS TO THE AMENDMENT THAT'S BEEN PROPOSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN. ALSO YEAH YOU HEARD IT REFERENCED- IN PRESENTATION. BUT THERE IS THERE IS LANGUAGE STATUTORY LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL THAT AUTHORIZES REQUIREMENTS AUTHORIZES A REQUIREMENT TO BE IN FEASIBLE UNACHIEVABLE. AND ON- UNREASONABLE IN FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE THERE. GOT IT. HOWEVER THAT IT IS THAT IS 49% OF PROJECTS POTENTIALLY UP AT EVEN OUR STATE'S CLIMATE REGIME. SB THREE SEVEN FIVE WHAT WE USE THEIR- AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE. EVEN IN THAT CONTEXT WE RECOGNIZE IT HAS TO BE ACHIEVABLE IN THE STATE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. THE FACT WE'RE GONNA STATUTORILY AUTHORIZED UP 2409% OF PROJECTS TO BE UNREASONABLE WE SHOULD NOT BE GOING THERE THAT SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. AND LASTLY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH THIS INITIAL I POPPED UP- HARPED ON ALL YEAR LONG. BUT THE FACT THAT THE OPR CAN. BIG FOOT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL IN THIS BILL THE WAIT IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. WE HAVE THOUGHT THAT THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE ALL SORT OF UNDERSTOOD WOULD BE DEALT WITH IT HASN'T BEEN YET HE NEEDS TO BE. AN TO THE ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THIS BILL THAT PLAY INTO THIS BILL. BOARD OF FORESTRY STATE FIRE MARSHAL CAL FIGHTER. EVERY ONE OF THOSE AGENCIES IS OPERATING. REGULATORY PACKAGES UPDATING WILDFIRE MAPS BUILDING STANDARDS EVERYONE OF THOSE ACTIVITIES PLAYS INTO THIS BILL. THOSE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE SETTLED LATE THIS YEAR LIKELY NOVEMBER. THAT SHOULD BE THE POINT IN TIME WHEN WE TAKE A STEP BACK LOOK AT ALL THOSE CHANGES AND SAY. NOW WHAT REALLY IS IN PLAY IN THIS BILL BUT AS THE SENATOR SAID. THERE'S A CHANCE THE BOARD OF FORESTRY. FOR ONCE IS ALSO COULD BE MORE AGGRESSIVE COULD BE ARE GOING OFF IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE DON'T KNOW YET. BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THERE'S NO NEED FOR THIS BILL. SO THIS IS NOT READY THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE. IT NEEDS TO BE A TO YOUR BILL WE WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. LET'S NOT GO TO THE PHONES FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY GOT BURKE AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. TODAY RESPECTFULLY AND CONTINUED OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE.

I YES I DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M RUNNING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN COMMITTEES THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING OUT OF JAIL HAS THE SAME SITUATION GOING ON IN THIS COMMITTEE- BUT I DO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BACK AS WAS MENTIONED BY NOT ONLY YOU BUT SENATOR A STERN- THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'VE BEEN AT WORK FOR A WILL A QUITE A LONG TIME I ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU- I. HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND YOU'VE TAKEN SOME OF THE ADMIT IT MEN MINUTES I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- BUT OF COURSE IN MY SCOPE SCUFFLE HERE THEY ARE- ONE IS THE CONCERN THAT WAS MENTIONED RELATED TO SEQUEL- AND RELATED TO- IF A PROJECT IS DOWN THE ROAD AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE CAN BE SOME KIND OF MOCK MINOR MODIFICATION WITH THIS IN FACT REQUIRES A WHOLE NOTHER ROUND A SEQUEL CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SO MUCH- MEDICINE NUMBER. SO WE DO NEED TO HAVE CNTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT ISSUE THE EXAMPLE OF A CURB CUT BEING CHANGE IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AFTER RIGHT I THINK THAT EVEN IF THERE IS A TENTATIVE MATTER MAP APPROVED THAT A pFOR OVER A DECADE WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT TRYING TO MESS UP THAT TENTATIVE MAP THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT I DO THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT IF THERE IS A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS CURRENTLY. IN DISCUSSION AT A COUNCIL PLANNING COMMISSION BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LEVEL- THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THIS PROCESS I'M MORE THAN WILLING MORE THAN WILLING MADAM ASSEMBLY WOMAN NOW SAY THIS ON THE RECORD TODAY TO BE ABLE TO FIND A SWEET SPOT FOR A COMPROMISE- BUT IT THE EXAMPLE OF A MINOR CHANGE IN THE SIDEWALK OR A CURB CUT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT TRIGGERING A WHOLE NEW REFERRAL FOR ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AT THE A SEQUIN MITIGATION AND WILDFIRE SAFETY. THANK YOU AND THEN I HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. THIS LAST FRIEDMAN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THE C. C. GOLDEN STATE TOUR AND WE WERE UP IN THE ROOM FIRE ZONES WE WERE UP IN. MANY AREAS HAVE HAD QUITE A BIT OF DAMAGE AND- THERE WERE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN FORESTRY BETWEEN. DEVELOPERS BETWEEN ALL THE REGULATION- THAT HAPPENS IN ORDER TO GET A PROJECT MOVE FORWARD. AND SOME OF THE CONCERN IS WHAT HAS BEEN STATED WHICH IS. ON THE ONE HAND WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH CALIFORNIA FORWARDING YOU WERE JUST HERE LAST WEEK WITH- MOVING SOME BILLS THAT WOULD. MOVE FORWARD WITH HOUSING. AND THEN THE OTHER HAND IS THIS GOING TO ACTUALLY STALL OR- REDUCE HOUSING UNITS AS THIS IS NOW- AMENDED. TO JUST SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ONE OF YOUR- I THINK AREAS YOU SPEND TIME IS TRYING TO GET HOUSING PRODUCTION. I HAD EVER SEEN YES WE'VE AMENDED THE BILL JUST TO FOCUS ON RESIDENTIAL SO THAT IS WHERE WE TO MINUTES- COMMERCIAL RETAIL EXEDRA. LOOK WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. SOME OF THE OPPONENTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM TO DAY WERE NEUTRAL ON A BILL. CANDIDLY WAS STRONGER LAST YEAR IT RECEIVED A VETO NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THESE NEW RAGS DON'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL THE NEXT RENEWAL CYCLE WHICH IS NINE YEARS ALMOST A DECADE AWAY THAT WAS- AND ADMIT THAT WE TOOK NUMBER THREE ON OPR. SO THROUGH SENATOR WIENER WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT. TO IN BED OPR LANGUAGE THAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BILL BASED OFF OF THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN RULES AND NOT ON NEW RULES THAT WILL BE ARE STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO DRAFT AND APPROVE. SO THAT WE AT ELIMINATE ANY SQUISHY NESS ON WHAT THE POTENTIAL NEW OPR RATES WOULD BE BECAUSE WE BASE THEM OFF LAST YEAR WHICH- CANDIDLY- MANY OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE TODAY. WERE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL WITH THE SAME LANGUAGE LAST YEAR. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IN REGARDS TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- I LET MY TRACK RECORD SPEAK FOR MYSELF- I CO CHAIRED OUR HOUSING WORKING GROUP IN THE SENATE. MY WIFE AND I STRUGGLE TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THE HOME AND I GREW UP IN BUT STAY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WE THAT I GREW UP IN. IF YOU'RE A FORDER HOME. HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TO ME. AND WHAT I'VE SEEN. OVER MY TIME THIS LEGISLATURE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. IT'S FIRE IF THE FIRE. THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO I WORK FOR HAVE LOST THEIR HOME. AND WE'VE CHEERED THIS BILL TO ENSURE THE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS. HAVE MORE MITIGATIONS BUT NO WE'RE IN THIS BILL DOES IT SAY THAT HOUSING CAN'T BE BUILT. BOTTOM LINE. NOW WE HAVE TO DO ADDITIONAL EGRESS AND INGRESS AND EGRESS YES WOULD YOU HAVE TO BUILD A BUILDING H. AWAY DUES TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN WORK ON- WILDFIRE- MITIGATION YES BUT IT'S COMMON SENSE AND I GOT TO BE CANDID MAKE THIS INTO YOUR BILL THIS BILL HAS BEEN IN FRONT OF THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT LAST YEAR THAT WAS YEAR TWO. WE'RE NOW IN YEAR THREE. SO IF NOT HI I JUST MIGHT MIGHT MIGHT YOU HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF MY FRUSTRATION OF. WE'VE TRIED TO BE ABLE TO A MAN THIS BILL- TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT MORE PALATABLE WHILE ALSO ACTUALLY PROTECTING LIVES WHO- FOR FOLKS WHO LIVE IN A NEW DEVELOPMENT. NOT TURN BACK OVER TO YOU SOMETHING THAT. THANK YOU THAT THAT'S IT. ME AS FOR OTHERS. THIS WORKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I'VE APPRECIATED OUR CONVERSATIONS I KNOW WE ALSO SPOKE THIS WEEKEND AND- IT'S ALWAYS FUN POLICY MAKING ON THE WEEKENDS- SO YOU KNOW I HATE MY DISTRICT I HAD A OF. A FIRE IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND OAKLAND BERKELEY HILLS THAT SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER IT'S- AREAS. UNDER UNDERSTANDABLE MYSTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IN MY REGION WE HAD OVER TWENTY HUNDRED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DESTROYED. OVER FOUR HUNDRED APARTMENTS AND CONDOS DESTROYED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FAT I THINK SORT ONE OF THE FIRST BIGGER SORT OF URBAN- ISSUE FIRES THAT- WE'RE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- SO I HAVE A LOT OF SENSITIVITY TO WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THIS REGION AND- I HEAR ABOUT THIS. EVERY SINGLE DAY IN MY DISTRICT AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE DROUGHT AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT'S A REAL PUBLIC CONCERN FOR PEOPLE- IN MY DISTRICT. I'M ALSO A BIG SUPPORTER OF HOUSING PRODUCTION- AND I'VE AUTHORED A LOT OF THE BILLS THAT HAVE MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK TO PROMOTE HOUSING PRODUCTION I'M IN A BIG BELIEVER IN PRODUCTION AND KNOW THAT WE NEED WE HAVE TO BUILD THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS FOR THE NEEDLE I THINK BETWEEN THESE TWO ISSUES RIGHT- SO I DEEPLY APPRECIATE I THINK WHERE YOU'VE COME AND TALKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE STILL HONORING THE TRUE INTENT OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO PROTECT HUMAN LIVES IN THIS PROCESS. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING SMART ABOUT HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT HOUSING AND SOME OF THESE AREAS WHILE THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT WE CAN BUILD THE HOMES THAT WE NEED AND IT IS NOT. AN EASY TASK- SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE DONE SO FAR WITH THIS BILL. I WOULD ALSO ASK THAT- YOU CONTINUE TO SIT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE CONCERNS- AND HEAR THEM OUT- IT IS MY HOPE THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THROUGH YOU KNOW PREPARATIONS VEGAS OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH PREPARATIONS A THROUGH THE FLOOR THE SOMEBODY THAT. YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION SO THAT WOULD BE AN ASK OF MINE THAT THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. SENATOR AYE AYE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- BOTH YOU AND MISS QUICK SILVA HAVE BEEN VERY FOCUSED AND- SHE'S A HOUSING I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH YOU. YOU HAVE MY WORD. I WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO BE ABLE TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT AS I SAID ON THIS ISSUE I SEE WHAT- I THINK THAT THERE IS A MIDDLE GROUND- ON THIS- AND I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AGAIN. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT. HOW TO BE ABLE TO KICK BACK I COULD. ON CUTS MINOR I. LIKE THE- I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY BIGGER PICTURE THOUGH OF. IF IT'S IN PROCESS IF IT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED. AND WHERE IS THAT POINT. AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO WORK THROUGH AND- YOU HAVE MY WORD AND- AT. SOME NUMBER. QUICK SILVA. YEAH MY WORD THAT. WANT TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AND- HAVE SINCE YOUR CONVERSATIONS. WILL DO SO. I APPRECIATE THAT NOW WITH THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIMILAR. TO MOTION WITH THE BILLS ARE SECOND. YOUR SECOND I MISTER CARR. TO A QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I. APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR- PASSION ABOUT THIS FIRE ISSUE THAT HAS PLAGUED THE STATE NOT FOR SIX YEARS BUT FOR PROBABLY THIRTY NOW- THOSE LARGE FIRES THAT TIME MISS WHICH IS TALKING ABOUT HAVE BEEN GOING ON. SINCE MEMBER GETTING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL- WATCHING MALIBU. CALABASAS. ALL THOSE TO PAYING A CANYON FIRES. AGING THROUGH THERE AND EVERY FIRE WE LEARNED SOMETHING ELSE. AND THOSE THINGS GET CODIFIED INTO THE UNIFORMBUILDING STANDARDS AND ALSO THE UNIFORM FIRE CODE. TODAY'S COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING BUILT LIKE IN AREAS LIKE WHERE I AM AT. THE SOUTHWEST RIVERSIDE COUNTY WON THE FASTER GROWING AREAS IN THE STATE- HELLO A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ALREADY BEING DONE- THERE ALREADY REQUIRING SPRINKLERS IN THOSE AREAS FRANKLIN HOMES WHICH ADDS QUITE A BIT TO COST TO A HOUSE. THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ARE ONLY TO BE HAMPERED BY SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND LAWS IN THE- MITIGATION FOR HABITAT AND CONSERVATION AREAS- GIVEN THAT THERE ARE THOSE EXTERNAL PRESSURES YEAH. HOW DO WE HOW DO YOU GET A- RESIDENTIAL TRACT OF. PASSED THE HEAD OF THE LAWSUIT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WOULD BRING IN ANY IN ANY AREA LIKE WHERE I AM FROM. THAT WOULD BE THE WAY TO A KILLER A RESIDENTIAL THING AND YOU SAID IT YOURSELF YOU'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE DIFFERENT RESIDENTIAL LARGE RESIDENTIAL. PROJECTS BEING HELD UP IN COURT. BY LAWSUITS AND I DOUBT THAT THOSE LAWSUIT TO RUN BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. I PROBABLY BOUGHT MY PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT THOSE RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN THOSE TYPE OF AREAS THAT THEY LEFT. AND I WOULD SAY THAT EVERY PLACE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS A IS PRONE TO FIRE AND THAT'S A CALIFORNIA IS- WE'VE LEARNED A LOT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALSO LEARNED IS THAT WE DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR PEOPLE THEY WIND UP IN THE STREET. AND IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE OUTER BANDS TO BE- DEVELOPED. AND WHILE THESE ARE BEING ADDRESSED ALREADY. THEN THAT JUST PUSHES THE DEVELOPMENT BACK INTO AREAS THAT ARE ALREADY DEVELOPED. AND IN THOSE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE DON'T WANT DEVELOPMENT WILL BE PRESERVED FOREVER- BY- BY OUR CAMPS- TO SOLVE ISSUES LIKE THIS- EVERY AREA EVERY REGION HAS THEIR OWN DIFFERENT FIRE PROBLEM. AND IN THOSE FIRE AGENCIES THAT TAKE CARE OF THOSE AREAS A COUNTIES THE CITIES AND THE FIRE AGENCIES ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND THEIR SPECIFIC AREAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS A MUCH DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT PROBLEM THAN THEY HAVE UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OR THE BAY AREA OR THE COASTAL REGIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT PERCENT THEY ARE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT HUMIDITY RATES THEY HAVE DIFFERENT BURNING RATES THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES CHAPARRAL- AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO NEED TO PUT TOGETHER THE PLAN. D. FOR THEIR AREA AND THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT. SO I'M NOT SEEING WHAT THIS IS NEEDED FOR. IN TERMS OF INVENTING THAT- A LOT OF THE BURNS THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AND- THAT WE HAVE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT ALL OF US- THOSE CONFIGURATIONS OF HAPPEN IN COMMUNITIES OF MEN BILL LONG AGO. AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE STANDARDS AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TWO WAYS OUT- EVERY DEVELOPMENT I KNOW HAS ALL THOSE STANDARDS AND THEN SOME THEY HAVE BOXED EAVES. THEY ARE DEFENSIBLE SPACE THEY HAVE ALL THE HOME HARDENING- ELEMENTS OF A NEED BUT IF YOU HAVE ONE. BIG STANDARD FOR ALL OF IT THAT MEANS SOME AREAS THAT DON'T NEED SOME OF THOSE TYPE OF HOME HARDENING EFFORTS. WILL BE LEFT OUT. THERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MADE TO. TO TRY TO TRY TO ADHERE TO THOSE WHEN THEY DON'T NEED IT WHICH MAKES THAT HOUSING MORE EXPENSIVE WHICH PRICES MORE PEOPLE OUT OF IT. SO YOU KNOW I JUST SEE THIS THIS. REAL PROBLEM WITH CONFLICTING- CONFLICTING GOALS. AND AND THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS A IS HI I SEE FROM MY END AND BEING THIRTY FIVE YEARS IN THAT FIRE SERVICE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THEY DEVELOP NOW VERSUS WHAT THEY USED TO DEVELOP. AND IN THERE ARE SOME PLACES THAT THEY DON'T WANT DEVELOPMENT UNLESS IT'S JUST THEIR HOUSE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT AREAS LIKE MALIBU- THEY HAD TWO YEARS AGO THE FIRE THAT WENT FROM THOUSAND OAKS ALL THE WAY TO THE BEACH. AND I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO GO TO THE BEACH AS SOON AS IT CAUGHT FIRE MALAM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE WIND WAS BLOWING IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH. THE NEW WITHOUT BRUSHES LIKE. THERE'S NO STOPPING IT. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL THOSE FOLKS YOU CAN BUILD THEIR HOUSES ON THEIR LAND ANYMORE. NO THAT'S IT THAT'S A RISK THEY TAKE. WHEN THEY BUILD THEIR HOUSES. IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUT WHEN SHE TO CHIMNEY BASICALLY. SO YOU KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE MAKING TOO BIG OF AN IMPACT ON ON OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD HOUSING. AND INCREASE OUR SUPPLIES SO MORE PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD THOSE HOUSES. SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS WITH THIS AND- I AM THANK YOU KNOW I'M I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE OF THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER VICE CHAIR TO CHAIR OF SORRY TO RESPOND. THANK YOU- NUMBER ONE THIS BILL IS ONLY FOCUS ON VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES IT'S NOT FOCUS ANYWHERE ELSE. WHETHER YOU ARE LIVING IN THE CHAPARRAL OR LIVE IN- UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU ARE IN OAKWOOD LANE- WE HAVE THE MAPS WITH THE VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES AND SO IT WOULDN'T ENCOMPASS- EVERYONE- BUT IN THOSE SAME ZONES. YOU DO NEED STANDARD PROTECTION AND NOT EVERY COUNTY CANDIDLY HAS A MITIGATION PLAN IN PLACE FOR INSURERS THAT THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THAT IS NOT A UNIVERSAL PRACTICE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. NUMBER TWO- THERE'S A REASON WHY I'M A CO AUTHOR- IN CHAMPION OF OUR AB NINE HUNDRED EXTENSION THAT THE ASSEMBLY IN A BIPARTISAN VOTE SENATE PASSED THIS YEAR WHICH IS. A CENTER ATKINS BILL IT REDUCES. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- SEQUEL LAWSUITS TWO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS. HE GUARANTEES INSURANCE ANY DAY JUDICIAL REVIEW THERE'S A REASON WHY I'M SUPPORTING SB SEVEN- IN A BEEN A CHAMPION FOR THAT AND THAT IS- TRANSFORMING DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; DYING MALLS. OFFICE&lt;/c&gt; PARKS- IN STRIP MALLS. TO DO AT LEAST 50% HOUSING MINISTERIAL THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT SB NINE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD QUICKLY- DUPLEXES IN FOUR PLEXUS. BUT I GOT TO SAY THE NEW REALITY THAT WERE IN AND THE REASON WHY THE FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORTS THIS. IS BECAUSE THE STATUS QUO CAN'T CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WE TALK ABOUT COST OF THIS BILL WE IGNORE THE COST OF A TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR PAY OUT. OF INSURANCE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TWENTY SIX BILLION. BY THE WAY FOR THE VAST MAJORITY THAT INSURERS ARE NOT GOING TO RECOUP THAT- IN THE TUBBS FIRE ALONE IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS ONLY TALK ABOUT COST. WHOSE TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN INSURANCE PAYOUTS TWELVE BILLION IN THE CAMPFIRE IT WAS NINE BILLION. SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS ON THE FRONT END BUT LET'S JUST BE HONEST. THE MORE WORK WE HAVE IN THE FRONT IN THE CHEAPER IT'S GOING TO BE LONGER TERM FOR HOMEOWNERS IN CELLS. WE CAN'T IGNORE THAT FACT ON THE LAWSUIT THE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL LAWSUITS ARE IN- TIE IN SAN DIEGO AND THEN IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS. AND LAKE COUNTY IS BECAUSE PER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THEY DID NOT COMPLETE PROPER FIRE MITIGATION VIA SEQUEL THAT'S THE ONLY REASON SO WE HAVE THIS BILL THAT WOULD CITY STATE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE STANDARD RIGHT NOW IT'S BEING DONE AN AD HOC BASIS WE'RE GOING TO BUILD HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF UNITS IN A VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES WHY WOULDN'T WE WANT TO HAVE THESE MEDICATIONS. I GOTTA BE HONEST ABOUT IT AND EVEN WITHOUT THIS BILL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO AFTER. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT UPHOLDING THEIR END ON SEQUEL WHEN IT COMES TO WHILE FAR MITIGATION THERE'S A REASON WHY. I INDUSTRY SPENDING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT NOW ON A MEDIA CAMPAIGN AGAINST THIS BILL. IT'S UNHEARD OF. THIS BILL PASSED THIS LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT A STRONGER VERSION OF THIS BILL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT I'M NOT AN ALTERNATE YOUR FRUSTRATION MISTER ROGERS I COULD TELL YOU LOVE THE VICE YEAR HE ALWAYS MAKES HIMSELF INCREDIBLY AVAILABLE BUT I JUST GOT TO SAY WE HAVE. CONFORM THIS BILL TO THE SAME BILL THAT EVERYONE VOTED ON THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN OPR STANDARDS LAST YEAR. THE MAIN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL WERE NEUTRAL LAST YEAR. ON ONE EIGHTY TWO. SO I SAY ALL THAT IS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN COMPROMISE YOU HAVE MY WORD SIR IT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO COMPROMISE. I AM NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN ME TOO BECAUSE THAT'S WHO I AM AND THAT'S WHAT I REALLY BELIEVE IN AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET EVENTUALLY IF WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE A TO GET THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ONCE AGAIN. ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. THANK YOU MR GRUBER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- WHAT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR YOU'RE ALWAYS SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND YOU COMPLEMENT THE PEOPLE TO COME TO YOUR COMMITTEES AND I WANT TO EXTEND THAT SAME COURTESY TO YOU I THINK THERE'S NO ONE HERE THAT DOUBTS HOW MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT- ISSUES RELATED TO WILDFIRES AND- REALLY HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION ON THESE ISSUES AS YOU LAID OUT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS NOW AND WAS. REMARKING TO- IT'S AMAZING WAS MARKETS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE DRIVING FROM THE AIRPORT TODAY BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WELL- FOREVER BLIND. MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SURF DURING THIS DECADE. IS THE FACT THAT. ALMOST ALL OF US HAVE HAVE WILDFIRES TEAR THROUGH A COMMITTEE. OUR COMMUNITIES AND CERTAINLY THAT WAS THE CASE FOR ME- JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER BEING ELECTED WITH THE WHEN THE WEALTHY FIRE. TORE THROUGH MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE VICE CHAIRMAN TRENT- AND I WAS A SEARING EXPERIENCE FOR ME- AND FOR MY COMMUNITY AND I. I SUSPECT THAT THE REASON YOU'VE GOTTEN SUCH. STRICT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO PASS IS BECAUSE EVERYONE IN THIS LEGISLATURE APPRECIATES THAT WILDFIRE IS A- AN EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING. AND TIMELY AND URGENT PUBLIC POLICY CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE REASON I SUSPECT YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE CONCERNED TODAY AND REASON I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS BILL ALL RIGHT VERY MUCH COMMEND YOU FOR WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IS BECAUSE- THIS BILL IS AT THE INTERSECTION OF TWO TWO OF OUR BIGGEST PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGES ON ONE HAND WILDFIRES. AND ON THE OTHER HAND ARE HOUSING AND HOMELESS CRISIS AND IT'S WHICH HAVE ONLY GROWN. MORE URGENT IN IN IN RECENT YEARS. AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM FROM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I WANT TO ADD MY VOICE TO THAT. IS CONCERNED ABOUT STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE AND THREADING THAT NEEDLE AS OUR AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY PUT IT. QUITE ELOQUENTLY- YOU KNOW I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THIS. NIGHT PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM BUILDING BUT THE QUESTION FOR ME IS THIS GOING TO MAKE HOUSING. MORE EXPENSIVE. UNNECESSARILY I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE FIFTY ON- YOU KNOW SO I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT. THE PROGRESS. ON SEE WHAT YOU'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE AND I WANT TO LEND MY VOICE. TO THOSE EXPRESSING. CONCERN ON THAT ISSUE. THE OTHER THING I DID WANT TO BRING UP WITH YOU AND I KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT IT IS THAT. THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION FROM KIND OF LOS ANGELES- I KNOW THAT THAT WAS WAS LATE OPPOSITION AND THINK I CAN'T DEFEND THEM ON THE PROCESS THERE- BUT BUT I DON'T THINK THE FACT THAT THEIR- THEIR ARGUMENTS WERE REYES LATE MEANS THAT WE SHOULD. WE THREATEN OUR THEM CORRECT AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT THE COUNTY SAYS THAT WHILE THIS BILL IS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH THE DIRECTION THAT LOS ANGELES IS COUNTY ITSELF IS MOVING. IT GOES WELL ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED CREATING UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY HURDLES AND REALLY. PLAN PACKED WITH FUTURE PROJECTS AND THINGS IN DEVELOPMENT ITSELF. I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT SORT OF WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT THAT THAT'S ONE OF MY- ONE OF MY CONCERNS. WHAT WHAT COMMITMENTS YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE- AND THEN THE OTHER IS. IS ON- YOU KNOW BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAS BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ABOUT- YOU KNOW. WHETHER THE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS THAT ARE ADOPTED ARE REASONABLE FEASIBLE AND ACHIEVABLE AND THAT. THIS NOTION OF. THAT THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT A MAJORITY OF THEM SHOULD BE AND I YOU KNOW I THINK. CANDIDLY WE SHOULD. AIM FOR HIGHER THAN THAT AND I'M NOT SO WHAT OF. GENERAL'S ABOUT. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE- OF THAT. THE PEOPLE THAT WE REGULATE THAT. WE MAKE THE GOALS IN THE STANDARDS YOU KNOW FEASIBLE AND REASONABLE ACHIEVABLE TO MUCH MUCH HIGHER LIKE A TIME I THINK A 100% IS PROBABLY- ILLUSORY AND IN ANY CASE BY. BUT CERTAINLY. TO ME THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING BETWEEN FORTY NINE AND A HUNDRED SO. THAT'S ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE AGAIN I AM. YOU KNOW. EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOALS OF THIS BILL. I THINK THAT THERE IS AN URGENT CRISIS- I COMMEND YOU FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THIS AREA. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET IN EARLY EXACERBATE OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS EXACERBATE OUR HOUSING CRISIS. FURTHER DRIVE UP THE COST OF HOUSING YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU AND YOUR WIFE STRUGGLE TO STAY. IN THE HOUSE THAT YOU WERE RAISED IN. I HEAR ALL THE TIME FOR PEOPLE WHO GREW UP IN MY COMMUNITY THAT. THEY THEY THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY I GREW UP AND IT'S A HOW DO WE STRIKE THAT APPROPRIATEBALANCE- WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. YOUR THOUGHTS ON SOME OF THESE PLEASE POINTS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER SENATE APPRECIATE THAT. FIRST AND FOREMOST ON. A LOS ANGELES COUNTY YEAH NO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT REGARD TO WIN EVER- IN INDIVIDUAL. BRINGS FOR OPPOSITION IT'S MERITED WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION- SO I'LL JUST SAY THIS- WE'VE HAD. SOME INITIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH- L. A. COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES. I BELIEVE THAT TWO DAYS- AND THEN CENTER IN FRONT OF YOU TO TAKE A- STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. MORE CONVERSATIONS AND I DO BELIEVE. THAT IF YOU WERE TO TALK AT WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE. BUT IF ANYWHERE TO TALK WITH L. A. COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES. THEY WOULD SAY THAT WERE MORE THAN WILLING AND WANTING TO ENGAGE. TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE ABLE TO- FIGURE THIS OUT WITH HIM. ON THE ISSUE OF ACHIEVABLE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT THIS DOESN'T THE NEW RAGS ON THIS. BASE OFF. OF FEEDBACK- THAT WE HEARD AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. WE WON'T EVEN SEE THIS GOING. TO AFFECT UNTIL THE NEXT RENEWAL CYCLE. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT NINE AND A HALF TíNH YOU. DOWN THE- RIGHT- INTO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON HERE TODAY. THE OTHER IECES THAT- MISS CLARK SILVA I ASKED MISS WEEKES ALSO ASK. IS ON THE ISSUE ND I THINK IT'S- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS AND I DON'T WANNA BES WHATSOEVER. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT ON THE ISSUE OF SEQUEL- AND- WHERE THAT SWEET SPOT IS. I TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN LAND THIS. WITH INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES. ON WHERE'D- THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS. AND HOW HOUSING- SORT SO THE EXAMPLE I GAVE IS. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR TENTATIVE MAP FOR EXAMPLE. A TENTATIVE MAP CAN BE- CAN STAY. IN PLACE FOR. OVER TEN YEARS. WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN GOING THERE. IF YOU HAVE. A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS CURRENTLY IN PROCESS OR- WHETHER IT'S A PLANNING LEVEL OR- IN FRONT OF A LOCAL GOVERNING BODY. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE A FOCUS IN ON THAT ECAUSE IT DOES NOT HAVE APPROVAL- THERE IS AN EXAMPLE I'M NOT USING THIS THAT KICKED THE DOG WHATSOEVER BUT- IF WOULD OCCUR CUT FOR EXAMPLE- KICK IN. ADDITIONAL RAGS OR A RECIRCULATION OF THE DEVICE THAT I DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT OUR INTENTION WHATSOEVER AND I'D BE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT- THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS I THINK. JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT AND I ALWAYS WANNA BE TRANSPARENT I THINK THAT THE PIECE WHERE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE HAVE A BILL. THAT'S GOING TO PROTECT RESIDENTS. AND MEET WHERE- INDUSTRY NEEDS ARE JUST BEING CANDID AND WILL CONTINUE TO ME ON THAT AND I WANT TO FIND A COMPROMISE SO THAT WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER AND BEGIN HOPEFULLY GET A BIPARTISAN. VOTE ON THE FLOOR. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT THAT THAT VERY MUCH AND- YOU'RE JUST A PLATE IF I RESPOND TO IT YOU KNOW. I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORK YOUR BILLS- AND I THINK THE CONVERSATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE STEPS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW IF I COULD SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MYSELF I THINK WHAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE PERHAPS SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS ON THIS COMMITTEE IS IN A DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS MAYBE MAYBE A FEW MORE STEPS RIGHT YOU'VE YOU'VE MENTIONED THE SWEET SPOT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY- I WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL I THINK THIS IS AN- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BELT. I THINK A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES FEEL THE SAME WAY BUT I'LL TELL YOU IT DOES GIVE ME SOME PAUSE WHEN I HEAR SOMEONE WHO SERVED AS A FIREFIGHTER FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND RETIRED AS A BATTALION CHIEF TELL ME. AND ALSO SERVE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT TELL ME THAT THEY THINK THIS BILL DOESN'T HIT THE MARK- YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT MAKES AN IMPACT. SO WHICH- GOING TO DO- APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AS YOU ALWAYS DO TO WORK THESE THINGS HARD TO LISTEN TO EVERYBODY- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO GO BACK AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITHTHE COUNTY THAT I'M PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT- AND TO TRY TO HIT THAT SWEET SPOT. I THINK WE WOULD ALL LOVE TO GET BEHIND YOU AND SEE THIS BILL SIGNED INTO LAW- AND JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN AGAIN. THIS THIS VERY. IMPORTANT BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROTECTING MY COMMITTEE FROM WIDE FIRE. BUT I ALSO HEAR EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR FOLKS IN MY COMMUNITY A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND SODA IN ADVERSELY. EXACERBATE THAT PROBLEM. IS SOME I WANT TO AVOID IT IF YOU CAN FIND THAT SWEET SPOT I THINK WE'D ALL BE DELIGHTED. INDIA INDIA MY COMMITMENT AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK PART OF A COALITION CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. SUPPORT THE BILL. NO THAT THERE NEED TO BE DIGITAL STANDARDS IN THIS- AND- YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT WE'RE GOING TO. CONTINUE TO WORK. TALK- IN. AGAIN I KNOW THE ULTIMATE BACKSTOP IS THIS. IF WE CAN'T GET THIS FIGURED OUT- IT IS NOT GOING TO PASS THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR JUST BEING VERY HONEST ABOUT IT- IN SO IT IS. A MISSION THAT I NEED TO BEYOND TO TRY TO BE A TO FIGURE OUT. WHERE THAT COMPROMISE IS. AGAIN I THINK WHERE I WANT TO FIND A COMPROMISE. IS NOT. JUST BEING BLUNT. WE CAN'T NEUTER THIS BILL. BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY. TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO. MEET THEM. HALFWAY AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE- RECIPROCAL. AGREEMENT THAT. WE CAN. LAND THE BILL IN A SWEET SPOT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE SAID THE RIGHT THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY UP HERE. YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT YOU TO NEUTER THE SPELL AND APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO KEEP WORKING WITH INDUSTRY AND AGAIN ALSO WITH THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES TO. TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT 100% THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER. TRULY HEY FINAL COMMENTS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND THANK THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THANK OF OUR COLLEAGUES FOR A TRULY ROBUST CONVERSATION IN RECENT DAYS I THINK IT HAS BEEN SAID SEVERAL TIMES READY THESE ARE VERY HARD ISSUES ON THE ONE HAND WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE INCREDIBLE IMMEDIATE CRISIS OF WILDFIRES ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE THE LONGER TERM ONGOING CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING- I WILL SAY FOR ONE I THINK THE AYE AYE AYE A VERY MUCH- BELIEVE- THE AUTHOR IS DOING HIS. DARN HARDEST TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE- AND CERTAINLY- AS WAS ALLUDED TO- THIS IS NOT THE BILL THAT WE WERE THAT MANY OF US VOTED ON THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- THIS IS A MORE MODEST BILL COMPARED SB ONE EIGHTY TWO THIS IS THE THIRD YEAR THE DISCUSSION OF I WANTED TO OUR COLLEAGUES BECAUSE I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF YOU IN RECENT DAYS- APPRECIATE ALL OF THE FOCUS ON THIS- CERTAINLY THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD FRANKLY OVER THE WEEKEND TO- BRING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE. GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE ROUTE HOW WE MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON SEQUEL OF SEQUEL ON MINISTERIAL PERMITS- HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT IMPACTING- IMPROVEMENTS BEYOND THE PROPERTY LINE HOW WE ARE LIMITING THIS TO RESIDENTIAL NOT COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD IN THIS COMMITTEE- BUT I WOULD SAY THE AUTHOR I THINK YOU'VE HEARD LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT THERE IS STILL- IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- I SUSPECT FOR A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES. THESE ARE CERTAINLY COURTESY VOTES WITH THE HOPE THAT THESE ILL GET RESOLVED I WILL SAY ON THE TWO MAJOR ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED I VIEW THEM BOTH- AS REQUIRING FINE TUNE COMPROMISES AND LET ME JUST SAY MORE EXPLICITLY WHEN IT COMES TO GRANDFATHERING I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THAT IF THERE WERE EXPECTATIONS BY DEVELOPERS- IT IS ABSOLUTELY FAIR TO SAY THAT THOSE EXPECTATIONS OUGHT TO BE RESPECTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS WE STATED IN THE ANALYSIS- CLIMB THE CHANGES ARE. REAL AND- THESE. MAY HAVE BEEN SET AT A TIME BEFORE WE SAW. THE HAVOC OF WILDFIRES IN RECENT DAYS AND LAID OUT IN THE ANALYSIS I DO THINK WE NEED A VERY FINE TUNED BALANCE AND I'VE BEEN PUSHING BOTH SIDES TO CONSIDER THAT. ON THE LANGUAGE OF FEASIBLE ACHIEVABLE FOR MAJORITY DEVELOPMENTS- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT BUT THE EXACT RIGHT POINT WE WANT TO END UP. BUT I WAS ALSO I WOULD ALSO SUGGESTED I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS ALL OR NOTHING HERE. WE'VE GOT A STRIKE A BALANCE AND SO A PART OF MY COMMENTS TODAY IS TO REALLY ENCOURAGE. IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- CONTINUE CONVERSATION BECAUSE TO THE SENATORS POINT. I DO THINK IF WE DON'T RESOLVE THESE ISSUES- IT WILL LIKELY NOT BODE WELL. ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND I KNOW THAT OUR COLLEAGUES ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS ONE SO- WITH THAT- I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY- AGAIN I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS AUTHOR BECAUSE HE WORKS. AS HARD AS ANYONE IN THIS BUSINESS TO FIND THOSE BALANCES- I THINK THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS WILL BE IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR WILL BE CRITICAL- AND I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN. PART OF WHAT I WANT TO SIGNAL IS MY OPENNESS TO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS HERE TO GO TO LANDED AT THE RIGHT PLACE CERTAINLY DO NOT THINK THAT. WE HAVE PROBABLY A FINAL PRODUCT COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. BUT I THINK ON THE OTHER HAND THE URGENCY OF THE MATTER OF THIS IDEA THT SOMEHOW WE HOLD THIS FOR FOURTH YEAR THAT ALSO DOESN'T SIT EXACTLY WELL- BUT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT ANSWER SO- WITH THAT- AND LEICESTER ANY FINAL COMMENTS I WANT TO TURN IT BACK TO THE GOOD SENATOR FOR YOUR FINAL COMMENTS. SHARES USUAL- WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SINCERE ENGAGEMENT. TRULY WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOUR AMAZING STAFF TEAM MEMBERS THANK YOU KNOW HOW BUSY YOU ARE THANK YOU FOR THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU- IF YOU WOULD- RESPECTFULLY PROVIDE AN AYE VTE TODAY I KNOW THAT WE GOT WORK TO DO HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISTER CHAIR. AND WITH THAT THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND. A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOST IN TO PASSAGE AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN. CHU HI CHIU I SAY ARE DON'T KNOW. THEY ARE THERE NO. APRIL GABRIEL I. KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY MAIENSCHEIN CORK SILVA NOT VOTING. THANKS MONNING WICKS HI WICKS I. WAY FOR THE MEMBERS TO COME BACK THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MEMBERS. AND THAT BILLS ON CALL. LET'S NOW GO TO SENATOR STERN FILE IN TWO S. B. SIXTY THREE WELL IN THE FIRST. IF YOU'RE- A MR MAJORITY LEADER. ONE OF. FOR I RECOGNIZE THE MOTION. RICHARD I WANT TO TALK PASS YES- I THINK THAT'S STILL A MOTION THAT I'M PRESENTING SB SIXTY THREE. ALSO ON THE TOPIC OF WILDFIRES. DIFFERENT CHORUS OF SUPPORT HERE WE'RE BUILDING INDUSTRIES ACTUALLY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH- OUR FIRE COMMUNITIES AND CONSERVATION GROUPS AND- FIRE CHIEFS AND UTILITIES- WISH WE COULD FIND THE SAME- ON OTHER FRONTS BUT I THINK THIS THESE ISSUES THEY ALL AGREE ON WHICH IS. THAT THE BUILDING STANDARDS THAT VICE CHAIR BROUGHT UP VERY ELOQUENTLY AND- IT IN YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDS THE DETAILS OF WHAT IT IS IT A LOCAL ZONING LEVEL EXTENDING THOSE PROTECTIONS BEYOND VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES TO MODERATE AND HIGH ZONES IT'S GOING TO BE CRUCIAL. MARSHALING A FIRE RESILIENCY CORE LOCALLY SO PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY GO OUT AND DO THEIR HARDENING OF THEIR HOMES TOGETHER WILL BE CRUCIAL. REFORMING OUR FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS MOVING MONEY RIGHT NOW IN THE COMMUNITIES WILL BE CRITICAL LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE ROAD SIDE TREATMENTS WHEN YOU DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD AND YOU SEE. MUSTARD GRASS GROWING TEN FOOT HIGH ALONG THE ROAD SIDE AND SOMEONE FLICKED A CIGARETTE. IT'S NOT JUST POWER LINES FOLKS IT'S THOSE HUMAN CAUSED FIRES AS WELL SO I WE THINK THIS BILL WILL BE APPROVED CRUCIAL. STEP IN THAT PROCESS AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL I THINK I'VE GOT TO.

TO THE MOISTURE I THANK YOU FOR BRING YOUR BILL FORWARD I THINK THIS BILL HAS A LOT MORE OF AN ELEMENT OF ALLOWING LOCAL AGENIES. I NOT ONLY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT CAN BE HELPFUL TO THEM BUT IT DOES NOT RESTRICT THEM FROM. YOUR LOCAL DECISION MAKING AND THAT THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR A LOT OF LOCAL AGENCIES SO- IN MY READING THAT WRONG THIS NO THAT'S THAT HAPPENED TO BE A LOCAL AGENCIES WILL STILL BE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY WANT. AND THEY NEED TO DO AND DO THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING SO ANYWAY AND THEN PLUS WE HAVEN'T FUNDED THIS YEAR CORRECT I PRUNING. OKAY I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON FOR ALL OF US IS TO ENSURE THAT- BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR BIG ROADBLOCK IS GETTING THE RESOURCES AND IDENTIFYING PROJECTS ONCE THEY'RE IDENTIFIED BEING ABLE TO PUT HIM OUT. AND GET THEM DONE. WE NEED FUNDING TO DO THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO WORK ON YOURSELF. RESHAPE YOUR BILL AND I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY THANK YOU THANKS. ANY OTHER COMMENTS JUST WHAT THOSE EMOTIONS ARE SECOND.

BRING BACK TO KENNY ANY COMMENTS DISCUSSIONS. THIS QUICK SILVA- WHAT DID YOU SAY BOTH ENDS OF THE LEASH BOTH ENDS OF THE LEASE. ENDS OF THE LEASH WELL I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THIS BILL- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO HELP THEY'RE JUST NOT REALLY SURE WHAT TO DO BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WHICH IS A LOT OF JUDGMENT. AND THE JUDGMENT OR THINGS THAT I HAVE HEARD OFF ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS THINGS LIKE THOSE PEOPLE WITH THOSE THINGS OR WHY WOULD WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR ANIMALS THINGS LIKE THAT AND- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN NOVELS WRITTEN FOR THE BEGINNING OF TIME OF MAN'S BEST FRIEND. AND MANY TIMES MAN BESSEREN HAVE BEEN ANIMALS- SOME OF OUR MOST BRILLIANT CLASSIC NOVELS ARE ABOUT DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS. AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE NO DIFFERENT THEY BECOME VERY ATTACHED. TO SOMETIMES IT REALLY IS THE ONLY CONTACT THEY HAVE I MEAN IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT ANYBODY GOES UP TO SOMEBODY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND GIVE THEM A HUG AND SOMETIMES ARE ONLY PHYSICAL. CONTACT WE HAVE THERAPY DOGS IN OUR AIRPORTS WE HAVE THEM IN HOSPITALS AND WE KNOW THAT PETS- PARTICULARLY DOGS- VERY MUCH THERAPY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL I HOPE THAT- WITH THESE FUNDS THAT CAN BE EXPANDED. BECAUSE A SHELTER CERTAINLY IS A PLACE OUT. OF FIRM PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO GO INDOORS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A HOME AND HAVING. AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WHO ARE- ON THE STREETS COME INDOORS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE ONLY WAYS FOR US TO START TO GET THE RECOVERY WE- THAT WE REALLY ALL DESPERATELY WANT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL. YEAH I WOULD- MOVE THE BELL THANK THANK THE MAJORITY LEADER FOR HIS ACCENT EXCELLENT REPRESENTATION OF THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY.

ANY FINAL COMMENTS FROM THE AUTHOR. I LOVE THIS BILL MY HEART SINGS AND I APPRECIATE IT'S AN HONOR TO BE FOR THIS COMMITTEE MISTREATMENT I THANK U. S. FOR AN AYE VOTE. MADAM SECRETARY MOTION NEEDS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS TRUTH HI CHIU I SAY OCTOBER HI THE ALKALINE GABRIEL. YEAH I KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN QUICK SILVA HI FOLKS WHO BUY WEEKS. BILLS ON CALL. LET'S NOT GO TO FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR SENATE BILL THREE ONE CENTER PORTANTINO WELCOME. GOOD MORNING AND- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PRESENT SB THREE EIGHTY ONE THE BILL WHICH MAKES CHANGES IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE DISPOSITION PROCESS OF THE S. R. SEVEN TEN HOMES OWNED BY CALTRANS AS YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST BEEN A LITTLE SIXTY YEAR- EXCURSION THE CALTRANS IS GONE ON TO. BUILD THE FREEWAY THAN A TUNNEL AND PLEASE THAT- I WAS ABLE TO DO THE RIVER FAILED TO TERMINATE THE TUNNEL AND NOW WE HAVE THESE HOMES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE GO INTO PROPER DISPOSITION- SO SOUTH PASADENA HAS EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT SALES PROCESS. THESE CHANGES WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE DIRECT IN THAT INTERVENTION BY THE CITY IN PURCHASING AND SHEPHERDING THE PROCESS IT WILL GIVE TENANTS SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY UNITS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT PURCHASE AND GIVE CALTRANS A NINE MONTH TIME LINE TO SELL. EITHER ON ON OCCUPIED PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA I WOULD BE SOLD ACQUISITION PRICE WITH A FIFTY FIVE YEAR COVENANT ON THE LAND TO ALLOW THE CITY OF PASADENA TOURISTS SOUTH PASADENA. ESTABLISHING TRANSFER OWNERSHIP TO A CITY OF NON HOUSING RELATED AN THAT WOULD ACT AS A STORE OVER THE FALL NEW AMENDMENTS AND THE M. OF THE- SR SEVEN TEN FUND WHICH HELP COUNTY MAKE FOR. ON THE PROPERTIES- AND WOULD ALSO WHERE WHERE THERE ARE TO DO WITH THE ISSUE- TIMELY SO WE THINK A GOOD ADJUSTMENT LASTLY WOULD GRANDFATHER IN SALES OFFERS WITH AN APPRAISAL MADE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO FAIR MARKET VALUE THIS WOULD MAKE THE HOUSES MORE AFFORDABLE. FOR THE TENANTS AND OBVIOUSLY I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CALTRANS- AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE AND MOVES ON IN THE PROCESS AND I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE A WITNESS AND SUPPORT. ON THE LINE AT LEAST I HOPE AND AT THE PROPER. TIME WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NIVEAU. TO THE OPERATOR FORGET PLEASE FROM. THE MAYOR SOUTH PASADENA IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DIANA MAHMUD AND THE MARE AND I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THIS CITY IS A SPONSOR CHIU SB THREE EIGHTY ONE. AND TWENTY NINETEEN SIX DECADES HAVE ATTACKED TO CONSTRUCT AN EXTENSION OF THE S. FIVE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY THAT WOULD PASS THROUGH THE STATURE AT SOUTH PASADENA FINALLY AND THIS WITH LEADERSHIP AND VALUABLE ASSISTANCE AND SENATOR PORTANTINO. BUT THE THREAT OF THIS FAMILY EXTENSION BEHIND US MY COMMUNITIES ATTENTION IS NOW FOCUSED ON THE SURPLUS PROPERTIES THAT CALTRANS REQUIRED. FOR FREEWAY CONSTRUCTION. MOST OF THE SIXTY PROPER OWNED COUNTY. IN MY CITY HAVE NOT BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND MANY ARE IN THE STATE OF EXTREME DISREPAIR CALTRANS FACES VERY IS BASICALLY AN EPIC CONSEQUENCES OF GETTING THE COLLECTED PROPERTIES. MOREOVER MY CITY HAS BEEN DEPRIVED OF PROPERTY TAX REVENUES WHICH FOR MY SMALL SCREEN A HALF SQUARE MILE CITY OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND POPULATION IS OUR PRIMARY REVENUE SOURCE- DUE TO CALTRANS OWNING SO MANY PROPERTIES. SOUTH PASADENA HAS LIVED WITH DECADES OF BLIGHTED AND EXTRACTIVE NUISANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE IS NOW PAYING FOR SECURITY TO GUARD THE POUND FROM FURTHER DAMAGE OR ILLEGAL OCCUPATION. SB THREE EIGHTY ONE PROPOSES VERY CHANGES TO THE EXISTING SURPLUS DISPOSITION PROCESS THAT BETTER SHIP MY COMMUNITY NEEDS AMONG OTHER THINGS SB THREE EIGHTY ONE WHAT DO THE FOLLOWING. ENABLE CURRENT NON INCOME QUALIFIED CANNONS THE PRIORITY TO PURCHASE BEFORE ANY HOUSING RELATED ENTITY SO THAT THEY CAN REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AS MANY HAVE TOLD US THEY HAVE LIVED IN THEIR HOMES FOR DECADES AND HAVE LONG AWAITED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE THEIR HOME. TO IT WOULD ALLOW THE CITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ALL UNOCCUPIED PROPERTIES AT CALTRANS REGIONAL ACQUISITION PRICE THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS NECESSARY TO RENOVATE DILAPIDATED HOMES AND OFFER THEM FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THREE IT WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO ESTABLISHING TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF REQUIRED HOMES TO CITY PROVED NONPROFIT HOUSING RELATED ENTITY SUCH AS A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST TO PROVIDE IT RESPONSIVE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. FOUR I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO GET THE NATIONAL HISTORIC TO INCLUDE THOSE PROPERTIES ON THE LOCALLY DESIGNATED HISTORIC REGISTER AND REQUIRED THAT REPAIRS NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH OUR LOCAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ORDINANCE BE FACTORED INTO THE SALES PRICE. HAVING BEEN INCORPORATED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MY CITY. IS FORTUNATE IN HAVING MANY A- THAT DATE TO THE EARLY OF THE CENTURY. A GOOD NUMBER OF TOWN ARE LOW. IN THE PROPOSED FREE BRIGHTER FOR AND CHOIR TO FIND. FIVE THIS BILL WOULDN'T SOMEBODY. PROPERTIES TO BE SOLD AT FAIR MARKET VALUES WITH THE NET PROCEEDS EXCLUSIVELY USE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER COST OF RESTORING AND MAINTAINING THESE HISTORIC HOMES THE CITY CAN PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IF IT IS PERMITTED TO SELL THESE PROPERTIES AT MARKET VALUE. AND THEN ENSURE AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO AFGHANISTAN. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN MY STUDY. SIX OF THE CURRENT TENANT IS NOT QUALIFIER CHOOSES NOT TO PURCHASE IT SAYS HOME SB THREE EIGHTY ONE WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO PURCHASE THOSE PROPERTIES AT THEIR ACQUISITION PRICE. MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY REPAIRS AND RENT THE PROPERTY BACK TO THE CURRENT TENANT. AND FINALLY AT LEAST IN TERMS OF MY SUMMARY THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A TIME FRAME FOR THE DISPOSITION PROCESS WHICH IS TAKEN MUCH LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION I STRONGLY URGE A YES VOTE ON THE BILL AND WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR LET'S NOW GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO STATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY- PLEASED TO PRESENT SB SEVEN THIRTY FOR ITS- BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW. A COUNTIES TO ENGAGE IN. OF IN EFFORTS TO RESTRUCTURE REDEVELOPMENT DEATH- THIS WOULD ALLOW US CITIES TO HELP REORGANIZE TEST- THEY EVENTUALLY- PRIOR TO- THE- DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT- MANY CITIES ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTIES THE LAWS OF BIG WHETHER THEY CAN OR RE SEAT AT THE TABLE AND RESTRUCTURE. THESE AGREEMENTS- THIS BILL ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN IT DOESN'T REQUIRE. THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES AND TURN TO THIS CONVERSATION IT JUST ALLOWS IT SHOULD. THE CITIES AND COUNTIES BE INTERESTED IN- RESTRUCTURING REDEVELOPMENT THAT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FORTY EIGHT POINT 9% OF THE ART IS REVENUE. PASSED THROUGH THE COUNTY AND FIFTEEN POINT FIVE OF THE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT- THE RDA USE THE REMAINING 35% POINT 6% THAT ALLOWED. REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES TO PAY DEBT- OR TO- ENTER INTO DEBT. BY THE AGREE THE AGREEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR THE COUNTY TO LONG THE RDA PARTS OF ITS PASS THROUGHS. NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING DEVELOPER DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS THESE LOANS ACCRUED- INTEREST A 77% COMPOUNDED PERCENT COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY IN SOME CASES. AND THIS WILL ALLOW AGAIN CITIES TO- SIT DOWN AND RENEGOTIATE IT IN IN ONE EXAMPLE AS OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON PARK HAD AT THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION IN OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS THEY'RE ONE OF THE CITIES THAT ARE- FOR. CONTEMPLATING WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL COUNTY WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE COUNTY SO. THAT'SABOUT ONE INCH BY ONE INCH ONE CASE WHERE THIS BILL WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I HAVE SOME WITNESSES ARNOLD OVER HIS CLASSMEN AND STEVE CARMONA- ALL ALSO WHAT ONE FOR. THE ATTORNEY FOR SENDING THàNH PARK AND ANOTHER THE CITY MANAGER FOR PICKLE RIVERA TWO CITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS BILL. AMONG ANYMORE.

IN TWENTY TWELVE ACTION WS TAKEN BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHICH RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER SUCH ACTION HAD A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT UPON MANY CITIES WILL HAVE A DISTINCT TAX PASS THROUGH TREATMENTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ELIMINATES A KEY SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR RDAS TO RETAIN THE OBLIGATIONS INCURRED BY THOSE PASTORS PRIESTS. THE DIRECT IMPACTS OF THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAS RESULTED IN MENTIONS BEING LEFT WITH EXTRA SERVICE. OBLIGATIONS HE- THE CITY RUNNING PART BECAUSE OF THIS BILL IS AN EX. CAN JUST YOURS WHO S. SEVEN FOUR WE'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO NEGOTIATE A NETWORK ACHIEVING. RELEASED FROM SIGNIFICANT HIGH INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED IN THE PAST YEAR AGREEMENTS WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBLE REDUCTION. THE PRINCIPAL OWED BY THE FORMER RDAS IN CITIES TO THE COUNTY AND OTHER TAXING ENTITIES. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR RELIEF AND RECOVERY. CURRENTLY UNDER DEPEND THEIR PASTOR HUNTINGTON PARK POSE AS MENTIONED. PARTIALLY TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE HIGH INTEREST RATES THESE NUMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET. SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR PROVIDES MECHANISM FOR A LEVEL FIELD I'M NEGOTIATION TO REDUCE THESE AMOUNTS BY UP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. INTO ADJUSTING INTEREST RATES FROM THE RANGE. OF 7% OR MORE DOWN TO ZERO. SB SEVEN FORTY POINT MAKING THE- STABILITY OF SAID AND TO PROTECT THOSE WHO PAY THEIR TAXES DURING THESE DIFFICULT TIMES. WE BELIEVE THAT SB SEVEN THIRTY FOUR IS A BALANCED APPROACH IS A GOOD START A MUCH NEEDED COURSE OF ACTION TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS.

AND BY PROVIDING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO REENGAGE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF I'M SORRY RENEGOTIATE THAT MEXICAN AMOUNTS OF DEBT ACCRUED TO THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. THIS IS A DIFFICULT THING THAT I HAD OVER THE YEARS ENTERED INTO SEVERAL PASSED TO AGREEMENTS WITH THE CITY COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. WE CURRENTLY OWE ABOUT FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT NEARLY ONE THIRD REPRESENTING INTEREST. WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE ON THIS DEBT FROM THE 7% THE CITY CURRENTLY A CRUISE DOWN TO ZERO AS WELL AS ASK THAT 25% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUT OF OUTSTANDING DEFERRED PASSED THROUGH PAYMENT OWED BY THE- FORMER ID EIGHT RT EIGHT TO THE TAXING ENTITY. IN ADDITION THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO US AN UNDERPRIVILEGED COMMUNITY THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO RENEGOTIATE PLEDGED PROPERTY TAXES SALES TAXES OR OTHER LOCAL REVENUE SOURCES TOWARDS REPAYMENT OF HESE COMPOUNDING AND DECADE OLD.

I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THE UNIT THEY NEED TRYING TO ASSESS IT BUT THE LAND- ACQUISITION PART OF THIS HAS RUN INTO SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME CITIES THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR REPRESENTING- AND I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE WORKED ON A BIT- SPECIALLY WHEN.
