00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:51.836
OF THE TERM THAT THE BILL USE

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:53.104
RATHER THAN FINDING IS

PROCESS THAT THE COMMISSION USES

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:00.578
IS.

00:28:00.645 --> 00:28:02.680
TRANSPARENT ACTUALLY HAS PUBLIC

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:03.782
HEARINGS.

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.250
AND SECONDLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:06.851
IN FACT THERE'S A FAIR

00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:09.721
OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE AGES WHO

AS POINTED OUT YOUR ANALYSIS THE

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.729
AUTHOR HAS TO OF THAT THEY THINK

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:20.231
IN FACT THE THE TERMS FINDING

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.699
AND DETERMINATION ARE

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:23.935
INTERCHANGEABLE.

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.703
OF IF THAT'S INTO THE AUTHOR AND

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.172
THE COMMAND HOUSES POINTS THAT

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:30.375
OUT -- I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:32.911
CONCERN ABOUT TRANSPARENCY --

00:28:32.977 --> 00:28:36.081
SECONDLY RELATIVE TO TIMING --

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:37.816
THE BILL RIGHT NOW REQUIRES OR

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.517
ALLOWS THE COMMISSION UP TO TWO

00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:41.186
YEARS TO DO THE REVIEW OF THE

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.821

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.489
SINCE THIS IS IMPACT JUST A

00:28:44.556 --> 00:28:46.191

NEW DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.130
WE THINK THAT A PERIOD OF A YEAR

00:28:52.197 --> 00:28:54.499
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE

00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:57.669
COMMISSION TO DO THIS -- TWO

00:28:57.735 --> 00:28:59.104

NECESSARY.

00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.841
OF FINALLY.

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:06.111
WE HAD SUGGESTED -- AS AN

00:29:06.177 --> 00:29:07.579
AMENDMENT THAT THE COMMISSION.

00:29:07.645 --> 00:29:09.981

SO THE COMMISSION IN THEIR

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:33.571

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:12.717
I GUESS MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:13.618
THAT IF YOUR BILL GET SIGNED

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:14.719

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:16.254
AFTER THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.822
IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.490
AND YOU KNOW MY WATER DISTRICTS

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:20.825

LAYS THESE PROJECTS.

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.067
I MEAN IF WE GOT KIDDIES IN THE

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:30.701
DSL PLAN IN MIND WE COULD BE

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:32.170
SELF SUFFICIENT IN MY AREA YOU

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.805

THAT AND THESE PROJECTS ARE

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:38.810
VITALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR AREA

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:40.445

00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:48.953
THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUES IS MY

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.721
BIGGEST CONCERN.

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.757

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:54.392
I AM IN I LIVE IN SOMETHING IN

00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:55.860
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I KNOW THE

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.029
IMPORTANCE OF WATER AND I IN NO

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.730
WAY IN MY AGAINST PUMPING.

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:01.365
WATER FROM THAT -- KIDDIES

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.167

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:04.702
ESTABLISH A SUSTAINABLE PUMPING

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:05.937
RATE AND DO IT RIGHT.

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:14.745
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS

00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:15.213
ANALYSIS IS REVIEW AND

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.114
RECONCILIATIONS NOT DONE IN THE

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:17.748
FIRST INSTANCE IN THE ER AND THE

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:18.749
PROBABLY MANY REASONS FOR THAT --

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:19.650
IN MOST CASES IT IS BY THE LEAD

00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:20.384
AGENCY AND AND AND THE

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.152
RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES INVOLVED

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:22.353
BUT NOT UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:22.987
