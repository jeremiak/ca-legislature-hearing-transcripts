00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.637
THAT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.773
BECAUSE SEVEN DAYS IS NOT ENOUGH

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.074

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:27.626
AND CONFIRMING THAT THE PATIENT

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:28.961
HAS A NORMAL KIDNEY AND LIVER

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.763

HAVING PROP AND TO A PATIENT IS

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.214
MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST FOLLOWING

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:50.115
A STANDARD SET OF CDC GUIDELINES.

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.050

AND CAN INCLUDE THE PROVISIONS

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.867
RELATED TO PROP -- FEELS

00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:10.469
COMFORTABLE THAN WORKING TOWARD

00:16:10.536 --> 00:16:13.238
A BETTER ACCESS ISSUE TO

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:14.340
UNDERSTAND THE ACCESS OF THE PEP

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:16.208
MEDICATION WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:17.576
URGENCY BEHIND TAKING PET

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:19.578

THE ON THE PROPER MEDICATION AND

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:28.387
WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT SHOULD

00:16:28.454 --> 00:16:30.022
BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL -- WE

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.090
DO APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.992

SUPPORT THAT AND WE'VE ACTUALLY

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:11.964
IMPLEMENTED THESE PROGRAMS IN

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.799
OUR OWN PHARMACY SO -- BUT WE

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.367
JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY

00:17:15.434 --> 00:17:17.536
CAREFUL ABOUT HOW HOW WE DESIGN

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:19.471
THESE PROGRAMS AND I WOULD ECHO

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:20.105
THE COMMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:21.874
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND WHERE WE

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:22.841

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.714
COVERAGE AND NO THAT'S NOT THE

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:29.615
THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:31.150
NECESSARILY BUT THE BILL ISN'T

00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:32.284
VERY CLEAR.

00:17:32.351 --> 00:17:34.453
ABOUT HOW -- THE MEDICINE AND

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.754
THE PROGRAM HERE WOULD ACTUALLY

00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:37.756
BE COVERED -- I THINK THAT'S

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:39.425
EASY TO CLARIFY -- AND WE'D BE

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.059
HAPPY TO TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:42.628
ON THAT IN OUR REMAINING

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:46.231
QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS IN THE

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:46.598
BILL THANK YOU.

00:17:46.665 --> 00:17:48.267
THANK YOU.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:48.934
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.202
ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:53.005
FOUNDATION -- FIRST OFF WE

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:54.206
ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE PEP AND

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:55.574
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROVISIONS

00:17:55.641 --> 00:17:57.242
OF THE BILL I'M LIKE THOSE VERY

00:17:57.309 --> 00:18:00.245
MUCH -- WE ALSO RECOGNIZE AND

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:02.080
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT WE HAVE A

00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:04.082
UTILIZATION PROBLEM -- WE DO NOT

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:05.517
BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT THIS BILL

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:06.652
IS A SOLUTION TO THAT

00:18:06.718 --> 00:18:07.986
UTILIZATION PROBLEM.

00:18:08.053 --> 00:18:10.055
ON BY TAKING AWAY WHAT THE FDA

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.857
THE CDC OUR OWN STATE DEPARTMENT

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.926
OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN SAYING

00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:15.594
SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN

00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:17.396
TRUE FATHER WAS FIRST APPROVED

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:20.399
FOR PREP -- IGNORE IGNORING THE

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:22.434
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.236
OBLIGATION OF THE POSITION TO BE

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:26.672
PART OF THAT DISCUSSION PRIOR TO

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.141
THE PRESCRIPTION -- THE CMA

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:31.310
REPRESENTATIVE AS INDICATED --

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.445
SOME EIGHT SOME GOOD ARGUMENTS

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:34.012
RELATIVE TO THIS ISSUE BUT I

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:34.713
WANT.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.315
TO BRING IT INTO A VERY FINE

00:18:36.381 --> 00:18:38.750
POINT RELATIVE TO THE HIV TEST.

00:18:38.817 --> 00:18:39.485
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:18:39.551 --> 00:18:41.086
PEOPLE MAY NOT BE AWARE OF IS

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:42.421
THAT STILL EVEN AFTER ALL THESE

00:18:42.488 --> 00:18:43.222
YEARS.

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.491
AN HIV TEST TAKEN SOON AFTER

00:18:45.557 --> 00:18:48.026
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO HIV

00:18:48.093 --> 00:18:49.495
CAN STILL COME BACK IS NEGATIVE.

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:50.829
AND SO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:18:50.896 --> 00:18:52.364
DOING WITHOUT A POSITION BEING

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:54.099
PART OF THE DECISION MAKING

00:18:54.166 --> 00:18:55.667
PROCESS IN THE GUIDANCE OF THE

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:56.768
TO THE PATIENT.

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:58.303
IS POTENTIALLY PUTTING THEM ON

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.506
PREP BEFORE THEY HAVE BUT WHILE

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.174
THEY HAVE TURNED POSITIVE BUT

00:19:02.241 --> 00:19:03.609
BEFORE A TEST.

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.244
INDICATES THAT THERE THAT --

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.345
THAT THEY'RE POSITIVE AND THAT'S

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:08.046
A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO BE

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:10.716
CONSIDERED -- RELATIVE -- TO TO

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.284
THIS BILL -- I WOULD ALSO POINT

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:14.219
OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS RELATIVE

00:19:14.286 --> 00:19:17.523
TO THE THE AMENDMENTS ONE IS --

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.291
I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THE

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.026
THE PHARMACIES 'MSELVES

00:19:21.093 --> 00:19:23.328
NOT EQUIPPED TO DO THE KINDS OF

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:24.796
THINGS THAT THIS BILL NOW

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:26.265
REQUIRES THEM TO DO.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.667
INCLUDING AS MORGAN IS INDICATED

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.602

THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY

00:19:53.592 --> 00:19:54.826
THE PHARMACIST -- UNDER THIS

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.728

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:22.861
THE TOP PART I THINK WHEN I TALK

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:24.629
LOW TO BOTH THE GUYS BUT YEAH

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:25.330

THE DOES SPEAK TO EXACTLY HOW

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:33.438
MUCH TRAINING WOULD BE INVOLVED.

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:34.773
AND I'VE NOT LOOKING TO

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.409
MICROMANAGE BEGINNING A SENSE OF

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:42.480
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PHARMACISTS.

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.449
WILL.

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:46.418
DECIDED TO USE TO DO THAT

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:47.552
TRAINING RIGHT SO IS THAT THEN

00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:49.321
BECOMES THE UNIVERSE'S

00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:50.822
PHARMACISTS WHO'D BE WHO.

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:53.258

YES YES OKAY YEAH WE'LL HAVE TO

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:01.466
IMPORTANT AND AND I'M CONFIDENT

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:03.168
THAT STATE CALIFORNIA WILL BE

00:25:03.235 --> 00:25:04.436
ABLE.

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:05.437
TO IMPLEMENT IT WE WE MIGHT BEEN

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:06.705
ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF A LOT OF

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:08.240
DIFFERENT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES.

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:10.809

SO THAT IT DIDN'T IN THE BILL

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:26.091
AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:25:26.157 --> 00:25:27.325
AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:29.995
THE NEED TO LINK WITH THE

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:30.729
PHYSICIAN.

00:25:30.795 --> 00:25:32.530
RIGHT FOR THE PHYSICIAN SO RIGHT

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:33.798

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.670
AND IF THEY DON'T IF THEY DON'T

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:41.139
HAVE ONE THE PHARMACISTS JUST

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:46.912
PROVIDES THEM A LIST.

00:25:46.978 --> 00:25:50.048
AND AND I GUESS.

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:51.783
IT TO ME FOR FOR SOME OF YOU DO

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.851
A LOT IF YOU ORDER SAID ATTESTS

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:53.852
OKAY YOU'RE GONNA GET SOME

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:54.219
RESULTS BACK.

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:55.120
BUT IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.087
ANYTHING TO DO THEY ALSO MAYBE

00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:58.123
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE

00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:00.325
PROPER TO PAT BUT YOU'RE DOING

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:01.526
YES AT A CAN YOU TELL US IN MAY

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:03.161
SHOW SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT AND

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:05.030
AND AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:06.298
SOEONE WHO CAN INTERPRET.

00:26:06.364 --> 00:26:08.166
THOSE TASKS AND BABY DECIDE WELL

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:09.501
MAYBE THAT PATIENT NEEDS MORE

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.102
FOLLOW UP AND MAYBE IT'S NOT

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:12.237
EVEN ABOUT.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:14.139
PROPER BABBITT'S ABOUT.

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:17.208
SOMETHING CAME UP RATE -- SO --

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:18.677
SO IN MY MIND.

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.278
ANY WOULD BE GOOD IF THE

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:22.080
PHARMACIST ACTUALLY HAD A

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:25.517
RELATIONSHIP WITH A PHYSICIAN OR

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:26.952
A GROUP OF PHYSICIANS.

00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:28.119
TO WHO THEY'RE WORKING CLOSELY

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:29.621
WITH BEYOND JUST LIKE I'M ON A

00:26:29.688 --> 00:26:34.492
LIST ALL RIGHT -- BUT WHO WOULD

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:35.727
ACTUALLY.

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:36.528
PERHAPS MEET WITH THE PHARMACIST

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:38.029
GO THROUGH THE LAB RESULTS

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.464
THEY'VE ORDERS -- TRADE IF THERE

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:40.699
IF THERE'S PATIENTS WHO NEED

00:26:40.765 --> 00:26:42.801
PARTICULAR ATTENTION.

00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:43.868
SO BECAUSE IT'S MORE I MEAN I

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.470
REALIZED DON'T WANT CERTAINLY

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:46.104
THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS TO TRY

00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:47.072
TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THESE

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:48.406
MEDICATIONS TO PREVENT THE

00:26:48.473 --> 00:26:49.574
SPREAD OF HIV.

00:26:49.641 --> 00:26:51.576
BUT WE ALSO TO REALIZE PEOPLE

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:53.611
AND ONE OF THINGS THAT -- AND

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:54.813
PART OF CDC GUIDELINES WHICH I

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:57.148
DID REVIEW -- HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:26:57.215 --> 00:27:00.018
WE HAVE RISING RATES OF STDS --

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:01.653
BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE AREN'T

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.655
USING CONDOMS BECAUSE THEY

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:04.255
FIGURE JUST GOT PROTECT THAT

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.457
RIGHT THERE'S OTHER BEHAVIORAL

00:27:05.523 --> 00:27:06.825
THINGS THAT AND THEN YOU COULD

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:08.259
PICK UP YOU MEAN PICK UP CERTAIN

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:10.195
THINGS -- FROM THE TESTS THAT

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:11.563
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT ESPECIALLY IF

00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.832
THEY DON'T HAVE A REGULAR SOURCE

00:27:13.898 --> 00:27:16.701
OF PRIMARY OF REGULAR CARE SO.

00:27:16.768 --> 00:27:17.736
I A ONE BE SURE RETURN WE'RE NOT

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.170
JUST SAYING WELL ALL ALL WE CARE

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.572
ABOUT IS THE AND I KNOW THAT'S

00:27:20.638 --> 00:27:22.107
NOT YOUR ATTENTION IS THE HIV

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:23.975
PORTION BUT THESE OTHER LARGER

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:25.110
ISSUES.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:26.177
THAT GET TIGHT END AS WELL AS

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:27.412
ENSURING WE HAVE THE PROPER

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.580
INTERPRETATION OF THE SCREENING

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:29.948
TESTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT IS

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.883
PART OF THE CDC PROTOCOL I MEAN

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.519
IT'S AND IT'S IT'S SO.

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:36.187
THE IDEA OF COURSE WE'RE

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:37.355
CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS OTHER

00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:39.758
THAN HIV AND RENO FUNCTIONS AND

00:27:39.824 --> 00:27:42.694
POOR AND THEN -- TESTING FOR THE

00:27:42.761 --> 00:27:43.628
MEDIA AND GONORRHEA AND SYPHILIS

00:27:43.695 --> 00:27:44.496
IS IMPORTANT AS ARE ALL REALLY

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:47.332
IMPORTANT THINGS BUT I ALSO WANT

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:48.967
TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE --

00:27:49.034 --> 00:27:55.006
PUTTING EVERYTHING IN CONTEXT I

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:56.741
AM -- MUCH MUCH MORE CONCERNED

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.642
ABOUT SOMEONE BECOMING HIV

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:58.810
POSITIVE AND BEING POSITIVE FOR

00:27:58.877 --> 00:27:59.611
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:00.745
THEN I I MEAN OF COURSE I DON'T

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.247
WANT ANYONE TO GET GONORRHEA.

00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:03.748
CHLAMYDIA -- THERE IN DIFFERENT

00:28:03.815 --> 00:28:06.584
UNIVERSES IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:08.286
IMPACT ON SOMEONE'S LIFE.

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.655
THE RISK OF RENAL PROBLEMS WITH

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:13.491
CRAP IS EXTREMELY LOW IT EXISTS

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:14.759
AND THAT'S WHY WE EVERY SIX

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.061
MONTHS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THE

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:16.961
THE BLOOD WORK.

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:20.065
ON BUT IT IS IN TERMS OF

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:22.767
BALANCING -- I THINK -- AND WE

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.335
PUT CONSTRAINTS IN HERE THAT YOU

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:26.571
THAT'S WHY YOU CAN ONLY GET THE

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:28.973
THIRTY DAYS -- AND WE WANT TO

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.841
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:31.376
TO STAY HIV NEGATIVE AND AND THE

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:33.611
REALITY IS THAT IN THE SYSTEM WE

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:34.746
HAVE NOW.

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:36.314
REPORT OF REQUIRING PEOPLE TO GO

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:37.315

ONE OF THE VERY EXCITING THINGS

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:43.534

AND THE PERSON SAID NO.

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:33.364
BUT DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY A

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.433
LARGER SUPPLY [inaudible]

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.903

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:42.940
ANECDOTAL.

00:40:43.007 --> 00:40:47.878
BUT I'D CONSIDERED SERIOUS.

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:49.446
WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE'RE

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:52.716
MAKING IT ILLEGAL FOR AN ONLY.

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:55.119

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:01.258
THIS WILL BE A MISDEMEANOR.

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.993
AND THE INDIVIDUAL COULD LOSE

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.362
THEIR BUSINESS LICENSE. FOR THIS

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:09.166
OFFENSE.

PEOPLE HAVE DIED [inaudible]

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:13.571
OVER THIS.

00:41:13.637 --> 00:41:15.673
THE CONCERN IS THE SMOKE SHOPS

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:18.108
ARE SO INNOCENT.

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:20.644

00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:33.457
JUST SWEET WORDS.

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:34.491
COULD PROBABLY PROMOTE

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:34.792
[inaudible]

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:37.127
THE SALE.

00:41:37.194 --> 00:41:39.430
THESE FIGHTERS OXIDE CANISTERS

00:41:39.496 --> 00:41:42.032
AND THE ATTACHMENTS THAT COME

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:42.333
[inaudible]

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.568
THE DEVICE [inaudible]

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:48.639
IT'S A INDUSTRIAL CREAM

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:51.242
DISPENSER WHICH IS A VERY

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:54.311
COMMONLY USED DEVICE.

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.180
WHICH MAKES IT ALSO SEEM MORE

00:41:56.247 --> 00:41:57.715
INNOCENT.

00:41:57.781 --> 00:42:00.651
BUT TO ATTACH THEIR TO ARSON

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:04.388
TUBES IN BALLOONS.

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:05.956

THIS NITROUS OXIDE.

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:11.462
SO I WOULD ASK THE INDULGENCE OF

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:12.363
THE COMMITTEE AND I DID NOT

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:14.164
BRING THOSE WITNESSES AGAIN

00:42:14.231 --> 00:42:15.866

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.169

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:27.044
UNAVAILABLE.

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.214

PLAYING FIELD.

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:52.743
THIS IS THE RESULT OF DECADES OF

EVIDENCE BY HARD DATA.

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:32.182
ALSO WHEN COMBINED WITH THE

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.596
THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:47.231
IS EXACERBATED FOR ENTREPRENEURS

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:48.999
OF COLOR BY THE STIGMA IN FEAR

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.467

STATE LICENSING AND RENEWAL FEES

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:06.283
CREATE AN ADDITIONAL IMPEDIMENT

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:07.618
THAT THREATENS TO PREVENT MOST

MINORITY CAMPUS BUSINESSES FROM

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.954

CANNABIS BUSINESSES.

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:18.061

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.274
ALL THIS CREATES MARKET AND

REGULATORY CONDITIONS WHICH

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:32.909

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.061
INDEPENDENT.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:22.997
CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION JUST

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.165
BECAUSE AN ALLEGATION IS

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.301
REPORTED IN NO WAY MEANS THE

01:23:26.368 --> 01:23:30.605
MEDICAL BOARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.840
BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:32.407
ALL COMPLAINTS SENT TO THE

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:33.208
MEDICAL BOARD OUR FIRST REVIEWED

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.276
BY A DOCTOR ON STAFF TO

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:36.845
DETERMINE IF FURTHER ACTION IS

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.346
EVEN MORE.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:39.581
TO STATE REGULATORY BOARDS

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.615
CANNOT FULFILL THEIR

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.384
RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROTECT

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:43.818
PATIENTS AND OTHER CONSUMERS.

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:46.054
IF THEY ARE NOT NOTIFIED OF THE

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.022
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.591
THEIR LICENSEES.

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:51.359
THE FAILURE TO DO SO SHIELDS BAD

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:52.994
ACTORS WHILE EXPOSING PATIENTS

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.362
TO GREATER RISK.

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.364
AS YOU ALL ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.333
THE U. S. C. AND DOCTOR TYNDALL

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.467
SCANDAL.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:00.468
WHERE THERE WERE MULTIPLE

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.604
COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:03.838
FOR DECADES?

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.774
NONE OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.142
WERE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:07.976
BOARD.

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.310
THIS IS WHY THE MANDATORY

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.913
REPORTING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS TO

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.381
THE MEDICAL BOARD IS ESSENTIAL.

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:16.351
I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE CMA.

01:24:16.418 --> 01:24:17.786
STATED IN THEIR LETTER OF

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:19.487
OPPOSITION THAT THIS RECALL

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.956
REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR SEXUAL

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:24.058
MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS.

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:25.827
ONLY WOULD CREATE YOU SEXUAL

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.028
ALLEGATIONS ONLY.

01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.630
WOULD CREATE AN ENORMOUS I'M

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:29.998
QUOTING AN ENORMOUS

01:24:30.064 --> 01:24:31.666
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON ALL

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.635
HEALING ARTS LICENSEES AS WELL

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.537
AS THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSING

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:36.905
BOARDS.

01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:38.239
EXACTLY HOW MANY OF THESE

01:24:38.306 --> 01:24:40.041
ALLEGATIONS ARE BEING BROUGHT

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.643
AGAINST THEIR MEMBERS EVERY YEAR

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:42.710
IF IT'S AN ENORMOUS [inaudible]

01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:44.412
BURDEN.

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:45.747
IF THERE IS THAT MANY PERHAPS WE

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:46.815
NEED TO SHORTEN THE TIME TO

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.516
FIFTH THE FIVE OR SEVEN DAYS TO

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:49.751
REPORT THIS PERHAPS WE SHOULD

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:50.985
LOOK MORE CLOSELY.

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:52.754
AT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IF MR

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:54.989
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IS SUCH AN

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:57.025
ENORMOUS PROBLEM AS THEY SAY IT

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:57.992
IS.

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:58.526
NONE OF THE OTHER HEALTH

01:24:58.593 --> 01:24:59.794
PROFESSIONALS THAT THIS

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:01.663
PROVISION COVERS NONE OF THE

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:03.164
OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AT

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.399
THIS PROVISION COVERS.

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:05.934
ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.168
JUST THE MEDICAL DOCTORS I

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:08.470
HAVEN'T HEARD ANY OPPOSITION

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:09.771
FROM THE NURSES DENTISTS

01:25:09.838 --> 01:25:10.805
VETERINARIANS PSYCHOLOGISTS

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:12.574
ETCETERA.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:13.541
THAT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO COME

01:25:13.608 --> 01:25:15.076
THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO COMPLY

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:18.112
WITH THIS FIFTEEN DAY REPORTING.

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:18.713
TO THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSING

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:20.148
BOARD.

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:21.850
THOSE PROVISIONS ARE THE SAME.

01:25:21.916 --> 01:25:22.550
YOU WILL ALSO HEAR FROM

01:25:22.617 --> 01:25:24.752
OPPOSITION THAT SB FOUR TWENTY

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.688
FIVE COMPLETELY BYPASSES THE

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:28.590
PEER REVIEW PROCESS.

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.325
PUT IN PLACE FOR HOSPITALS.

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:31.159
THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:32.460
BILL.

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:34.295
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE EXISTING

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:37.098
PROCESS OF HAVING A PEER REVIEW

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:38.433
SYSTEM TO DETERMINE.

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.335
WHETHER THEY SHOULD REPORT IT TO

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:41.970
THE MEDICAL BOARD DOESN'T WORK.

01:25:42.036 --> 01:25:43.872
AND IS NOT WORKABLE FOR HEALTH

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:44.806
CLINICS.

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:45.707
ALSO IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THE

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:47.075
LEGISLATURE.

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:48.877
WE FINALLY CHANGE THAT IT'S NOW

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.745
TIME TO EXPECT THE SAME OF OUR

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.347
MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WE HAVE

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.015
SEEN MULTIPLE EXAMPLES OF

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:55.350
HOSPITALS FAILING TO INVESTIGATE

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.385
CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:58.052
ASSAULT.

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.154
THUS PLACING THOUSANDS OF

01:26:00.221 --> 01:26:00.755
ADDITIONAL PATIENTS IN HARM'S

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.356
WAY.

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:04.259
SEXUAL VIOLATION OF A PATIENT BY

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.460
THEIR PHYSICIAN SHOULD NEVER.

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:06.794
SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:08.363
SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE WILL HELP

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:10.131
ENSURE PATIENT COMPLAINTS ARE

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:12.033
TREATED SERIOUSLY AND

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.868
INVESTIGATED WITH THE SWIFTNESS

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:14.736
THEY DESERVE.

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:17.372
MEMBERS WITH RESPECT TO SECTION

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:18.673
FOUR IN THIS BILL SECTION.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.008
FOUR WHICH AUTHORIZES THE

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.943
MEDICAL BOARD TO SUSPEND A

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.046
LICENSE ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:26.381
PENDING FORMAL PROCEEDINGS.

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.349
AS YOU KNOW I CARE VERY MUCH

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:30.318
ABOUT ENSURING THAT ANYTHING WE

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:32.287
DO TO HELP THE MEDICAL BOARD GET

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:33.021
ITS ENFORCEMENT WORKED AND

01:26:33.087 --> 01:26:33.788
QUICKLY.

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.590
IS STILL DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:36.724
THE DUE PROCESS.

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:39.394
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT MY INTENTION

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.095
TO GIVE THE MEDICAL BOARD NEW

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:43.765
UNPRECEDENTED AUTHORITY TO TAKE

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:45.600
ACTION SIMPLY BASED ON

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:46.734
INFORMATION.

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:47.902
I AM WILLING TO STRIKE THIS

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.671
PROVISION FROM THE BILL IT'S NOT

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.806
MY GOAL TO SKIP ADMINISTRATIVE

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.608
PROCEDURES ACT REQUIREMENTS.

01:26:53.675 --> 01:26:55.109
NOR DO I INTEND TO ALLOW THE

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:56.544
MEDICAL BOARD TO HAVE BROAD

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:58.947
AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND THE LICENSE

01:26:59.013 --> 01:27:01.950
WITHOUT PROPER DUE PROCESS.

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:03.217
I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:04.385

MASTERS OF HEALTHCARE

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.498
ADMINISTRATION.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.634
A COST OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.069
AND I AM A SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:22.036
SURVIVOR [inaudible]

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:24.772
SO.

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:26.007
AS A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.875
LIVE WORK TO IN SOME OF THE BEST

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.544
HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS.

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.446
AND THEY'RE ALREADY COMPLIANT

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.181
WITH THE MEASURES SUCH AS

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:35.817
PROPOSED IN THIS AMENDMENT -- I

01:27:35.883 --> 01:27:37.051
WANT TO NOTE THAT.

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.419
MANY TIMES WHEN SERIOUS

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:39.187
ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE ACTUALLY

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:40.688
MOST THE TIME ANSWERS

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:41.222
ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE ABOUT

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:44.192
PHYSICIANS -- INVESTIGATION IS

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:45.994
COMPLETED AND A DECISION MADE

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.395
WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.797
REPORTED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR TO

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.000
SEVENTY TWO HOURS THESE ARE

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:53.001
TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY.

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:55.003
AND ALL SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE DOES

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:56.170
IS BRING ALL THE YOUR HEALTH

01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:58.039
CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN LINE WITH

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:01.743
INDUSTRY PRACTICES -- WE WE ALL

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.045
KNOW THAT USC -- THEY WERE NOT

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.213
IN LINE WITH INDUSTRY BEST

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:07.849
PRACTICES.

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:10.385
AND BECAUSE OF THIS -- I WAS

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.854
ASSAULTED BY GEORGE TYNDALL IN

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.088
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I SAW

01:28:14.155 --> 01:28:17.825
HIM AS A PATIENT -- AND ACTUALLY

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:20.695
WHEN I WENT TO THE CLINIC -- IT

01:28:20.762 --> 01:28:23.765
WAS VERY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT --

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:25.199
HIS BEHAVIOR WAS AN OPEN SECRET

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:27.535
ALL THE FRONTLINE MEDICAL STAFF

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:29.370
AT THE RECEPTIONIST'S THE

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:30.872
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THE NURSES

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:32.440
THEY ALL TRY TO HELP ME.

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:33.675
THEY ALL TRIED TO PREVENT ME

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.176
FROM SEEING HIM.

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:38.312
BUT I SIMPLY DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.181
THE MONTH IT WOULD TAKE TO SEE --

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:42.316
A FEMALE GYNECOLOGIST AND SO

01:28:42.383 --> 01:28:43.251
BECAUSE OF THAT I WAS SEXUALLY

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.919
ASSAULTED AND ACTUALLY

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:48.756
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASSAULT --

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.657
THAT'S THAT'S WHEN I SAW

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.426
EVIDENCE THAT THEY ALL KNEW WHAT

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:53.628
WAS HAPPENING THEY MANY OF THEM

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:54.762
CALLED AFTER ME AS I RAN OUT OF

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:59.267
THE CLINIC -- THEY THEY SIMPLY

01:28:59.333 --> 01:29:00.968
GAVE EACH OTHER A LOOK.

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:04.305
AND ALL OF THESE.

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:06.407
ALL THESE FRONTLINE WORKERS --

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:07.842
KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.277
I'M WITHOUT ANYONE SAYING

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:09.877
ANYTHING OTHER AND THEY'LL TRY

01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:12.680
TO HELP ME.

01:29:12.747 --> 01:29:14.348
AND I BELIEVE IT IS.

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:16.451
BECAUSE OF THESE -- AMBIGUOUS

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:19.287
REGULATIONS THAT USC LEADERSHIP

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:21.322
CHOSE TO IGNORE ALL THE WARNING

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.157
SIGNS ON ALL OF THE VARIOUS

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.493
REPORTING -- THAT CAME FROM THE

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:28.696
FRONTLINE MEDICAL STAFF.

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:31.065
WE ALL KNOW THAT -- TORSIONAL

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:33.768
INTO PRACTICING -- FOR ALMOST

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.303
THIRTY YEARS SING TENS OF

01:29:35.369 --> 01:29:37.905
THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS -- BECAUSE

I GRADUATED FROM USC LAW SCHOOL

01:30:29.757 --> 01:30:30.892
IN.

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:31.793
NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND I SAW

01:30:31.859 --> 01:30:33.861
DOCTOR TYNDALL IN. NINETEEN

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:39.901

SURGERY HOLE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP

IN PASSING THE PATIENT'S RIGHT

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:44.672
TO KNOW ACT HELP THE HELPING

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.340
THAT I THROUGH LAST YEAR AND NOW

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:48.276
THIS BILL AS BEFORE TWENTY FIVE

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:49.977
I BELIEVE IS VERY VITAL.

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.213
IMPORTANT TO PROTECT PATIENTS

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.881
AND TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY OF

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:55.883
WHICH WE'VE SEEN NOTHING AT USC

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:57.385
NOT ONE PERSON HAS BEEN HELD

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:57.952
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:30:58.019 --> 01:31:01.022
THERE'S OVER THERE SEVERAL

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:01.656
HUNDRED WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD

01:31:01.722 --> 01:31:01.856
NOW.

01:31:01.923 --> 01:31:03.191
IT'S VERY DISTRESSING.

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:04.525
OF PATIENT SAFETY AND HEALTH

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:06.093
MUST COME FIRST.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.829
AND THE LEGAL LOOPHOLES WHICH

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:08.863
ALLOW DOCTOR TYNDALL TO ABUSE

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:10.031
WOMAN FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS

01:31:10.097 --> 01:31:11.465
NEED TO BE CLOSED IN THIS IS A

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:14.802
GOOD TIME TO DO IT.

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:17.038
IF WE LOOK AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.940
LIKE MICHIGAN STATE.

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:20.575
WE KNOW WHY WE CANNOT ALLOW

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:21.609
INSTITUTION TO INVESTIGATE

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:23.311
ITSELF.

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:24.745
IT'S VERY RARE THAT IF YOU

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.214
INVESTIGATE YOURSELF YOU'LL FIND

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:29.317
YOURSELF GUILTY OF ANYTHING.

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.885
WE KNOW HERE THAT YOU WOULD

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.253
SEIZE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION IS

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.654
LEAD TO NOTHING.

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:35.022
IT'S YIELDED NO RESULTS

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:36.190
WHATSOEVER IN FACT THEY TOLD A

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:38.292
FEDERAL JUDGE LAST WEEK THAT

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:38.926
THEY DON'T EVEN PLAN TO MAKE IT

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:41.596
PUBLIC.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:42.964
AN INVESTIGATION IS NEVER MADE

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:47.168
PUBLIC IS PRACTICALLY USELESS.

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:49.270
BOTH OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WERE

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:50.171
CHARGED WITH CARING FOR THEIR

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:53.207
WOMAN STUDENTS FEMALE STUDENTS.

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:54.508
AND THEY'VE DONE THE OPPOSITE

01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:55.977
THEY IGNORED REPEATED COMPLAINTS

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.446
OVER DECADES.

01:31:58.512 --> 01:31:59.680
THEY TOLD NO.

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.349
ONE ON THE U. S. C. THEY

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:02.884
ACTUALLY HARBOR DR TYNDALL AND

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:04.886
THEY PROTECTED HIM.

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:05.486
THE EMPOWER HIM THEY COVER FOR

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:06.787
HIM.

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:08.489
AND THEY CONTINUE TO COVER UP

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:09.190
FOR HIM.

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:11.025
AT THIS TIME RIGHT NOW WE CANNOT

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.426
TRUST THE MEDICAL PROFESSION OR

01:32:12.493 --> 01:32:13.895
THESE INSTITUTIONS TO POLICE

01:32:13.961 --> 01:32:15.463
THEMSELVES EVEN WHEN THEY'RE

01:32:15.529 --> 01:32:18.366
CAUGHT THEY JUST WON'T DO IT.

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.902
SB FOUR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE

01:32:20.968 --> 01:32:22.069
WILL REQUIRE INVESTIGATIONS TO

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:23.337
COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY IF  DOCTOR

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:25.373
SUSPECTED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:26.707
NAP WILL PROTECT PATIENTS FROM

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:28.476
FURTHER HARM.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:32.313
AND THAT'S WHEN THE FAVOR OF IT.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.649
I WILL SAY THIS -- THE FIRST

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.417
COMPLAINT I'M AWARE OF IT WAS

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.653
WRITTEN AGAINST USC HAPPENED IN

01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:39.654
NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND THAT'S

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:41.455
THE YEAR BEFORE I SAW HIM.

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:42.390
IN OF A LAW LIKE THIS WAS IN

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:43.824
PLACE I MIGHT NEVER HAVE SEEN

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:44.558
HIM.

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:45.693
AND THEN THE WOMAN WHO CAME

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.128
AFTER ME FOR THE NEXT TWENTY

01:32:47.194 --> 01:32:48.329
EIGHT YEARS MIGHT NEVER HAVE

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.031
BEEN VICTIMIZED BY HIM.

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:52.233
THIS IS IT THIS MAKES SENSE THIS

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.603
BILL MAKES SENSE TO ME.

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:57.872
IN MICHIGAN STATE THEY WERE SO

01:32:57.939 --> 01:32:59.073
BAD AT INVESTIGATING THEMSELVES

01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.675
THAT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR HAD TO

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:02.410
BE APPOINTED. TO GET TO THE

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:03.778
BOTTOM OF IT AND IT WASN'T UNTIL

01:33:03.844 --> 01:33:04.845
A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR WAS

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:07.181
APPOINTED THAT THERE WAS ANY

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:08.582
ACCOUNTABILITY THERE.

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:10.751
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:12.053
THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING.

01:33:12.119 --> 01:33:14.522
FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR USC

01:33:14.588 --> 01:33:14.956
WEATHER HAS BEEN NO

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:16.824
ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:18.526
THESE EXAMPLES PROVE WHY

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:21.062
CALIFORNIA NEEDS SB FOUR TWENTY

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:23.097
FIVE WITHOUT THIS LAW.

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.165
SEXUAL ABUSE BUT MEDICAL

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:25.533
PROFESSIONALS WILL CONTINUE IN

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:26.634
SECRET NO ONE WILL BE HELD TO

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:27.969
ACCOUNT.

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.370
AND VULNERABLE PATIENTS WILL BE

01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:30.504
HARMED.

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:40.174
THERE'S A AN ASSERTION THAT --

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.809
THIS LEGISLATION IF IT WERE TO

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:45.546
BE ENACTED WOULD IGNORE THE PEER

01:39:45.612 --> 01:39:46.747
REVIEW PROCESS.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:47.414
SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE A PEER

01:39:47.481 --> 01:39:48.782
REVIEW PROCESS AND IN MANY CASES

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:49.483

THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS ACTUALLY

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:06.400
REQUIRES IT TO GO THROUGH THE

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:07.868
PEER REVIEW BODY TO DO THEIR OWN

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:09.937

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.178
THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:25.479
THERE'S THAT SO THE BILL DOES

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.448
ASSESS -- PROPOSES TO ASSESS

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:28.682
SOME FINES.

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:30.250
OF SOME SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU AS

01:41:30.317 --> 01:41:31.518
IT IS YOUR BOARD HAVE OPINIONS

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:32.886
ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FINES THAT

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:34.721
ARE PROPOSED I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:36.390
LEVEL FINES ARE -- EXACTLY TAKEN

01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:38.325
FROM THE LAW AND EIGHT OH FIVE

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:39.493
SECTION THEM.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.360
IT'S THE SAME AS THE FINES

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.595
IMPOSED FOR EIGHT OH FIVE

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:42.830
FAILURE TO REPORT AND I THINK

01:41:42.896 --> 01:41:45.199
THAT'S WHY THOSE FINES WERE

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:46.533
CHOSEN FROM MY UNDERSTANDING.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.335
SO YOU DON'T FIND THOSE FINES TO

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:49.770
BE EXCESSIVE UNDER HOW IT

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:50.537
HANDLED THESE MATTERS AND THEY

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:52.172
ARE IN LINE WITH OTHER FINDS AN

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.006
EXISTING LAW.

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:54.408
SO THERE IS ANOTHER PROVISION --

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:55.776
IN THE BILL THAT'S RAISED IN THE

01:41:55.843 --> 01:42:00.013

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:13.327

CHALLENGE ABOUT THAT DEFINITION

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:44.211

HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. TO TO MAKE

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:54.554
SURE THAT THAT -- THERE'S A EASE

ALSO HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS SEE

IN MAY AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:01.328
RAISED.

01:45:01.395 --> 01:45:02.396
AND I GUESS QUICK QUESTION FOR

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:03.163
SAM A I MEAN CENTER HILLS

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.398
REMOVED -- SECTION THE BILL THAT

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:05.932
I THINK WAS PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS

01:45:05.999 --> 01:45:07.734
OF BASICALLY SENDING --

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:11.471
PHYSICIAN'S LICENSE BEFORE THEY

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.507
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO TO

01:45:13.573 --> 01:45:15.275
ANSWERED THE CHALLENGES IS -- TO

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:16.743
WHAT DEGREE DOES THAT RESOLVE

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:19.012
SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU HAVE.

01:45:19.079 --> 01:45:21.214
SO THAT PROVISION WAS OF A MAJOR

01:45:21.281 --> 01:45:23.550
AB PROBLEMATIC PROVISION FOR US

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.285
AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE

01:45:25.352 --> 01:45:26.219
OTHER BEING WILLING TO REMOVE

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:27.020
THAT PROVISION.

01:45:27.087 --> 01:45:29.189
AS IT -- WAS EVEN MORE BROUGHT I

01:45:29.256 --> 01:45:30.757
THINK THAN EVEN MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:31.892
INTENTIONALLY.

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:33.026
PUT INTO THE BILL.

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:35.062
SO THAT DOES TAKE AWAY A MAJOR

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:36.630
PIECE OF CONCERN AND I THINK. TO

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:38.398
YOUR POINT AT SOMETHING ABOUT

01:45:38.465 --> 01:45:39.900
FILING A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:42.469
ORGANIZATION REALLY DOES -- IT

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:44.071
HELPS GET TO NARROWING I THINK A

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:45.806
LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT WE WERE

01:45:45.872 --> 01:45:47.374
CONCERNED ABOUT WHICH IS ANY.

01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.408
KIND OF IF YOU'RE IN THE BREAK

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:49.443
ROOM IN A POSITION OVER HEAR

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.611
SOMEONE SAY I HEARD SO AND SO

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.113
GOT A COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM.

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:54.414
THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN AYE

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:56.950
WE READ IT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:45:57.017 --> 01:45:58.585
WOULD BE PUT SOMEBODY ON THE ON

01:45:58.652 --> 01:45:59.286
NOTICE THAT THEY HAD TO THEN

01:45:59.352 --> 01:46:01.388
FILED A REPORT WITHIN FIFTEEN

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:02.255
DAYS.

01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:02.789
OR THEY'D BE SUBJECT TO

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:03.857
PENALTIES.

01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:05.692
SO I THINK -- THAT TAKES A BIG

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:07.060
STEP IN IN.

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:08.562
NARROWING THIS IS SO THAT THERE

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.397
IS SOMETHING THAT A STANDARD BY

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:11.665
WHICH THE PHYSICIANS AND THE

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:13.400
OTHER MEDICAL STAFF KNOW WHEN

01:46:13.467 --> 01:46:14.801
THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT SO I

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:15.969
THINK THAT THOSE DO TAKE

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:17.404
EXCEPTION OUR DIRECTION.

01:46:17.471 --> 01:46:21.241
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT STEPS.

01:46:21.308 --> 01:46:22.409
I HAD TO GET BACK TO THE LIMIT

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:23.443
ON THAT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL LET
