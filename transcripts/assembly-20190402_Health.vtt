MONEY IN ORDER TO KEEP IS MEDI

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.250
CAL.

00:37:33.317 --> 00:37:34.352
BECAUSE THE COST OF HEALTHCARE

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:36.153
SO HIGH AND LOW INCOME SENIORS

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.388
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:40.124
HAVE SO FEW ASSETS TO BEGIN WITH.

00:37:40.191 --> 00:37:41.392
WHEN FACED WITH THE OUT DATED

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:42.960

THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL?

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:49.967
SO IT THIS WAY ASKING FOR THREE

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:51.836
THINGS THE FIRST IS TO INCREASE

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.237

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:55.473
EMERGENCIES.

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:56.841
THE SECOND IS TO SIMPLIFY THE

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:59.043

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:04.615
MANY PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THE

00:38:04.682 --> 00:38:05.816
ASSETS TEST HAVE TO GET

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.218
CONSIDERABLE HELP IN

KEEP THEIR MEDI CAL.

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:14.225
AND THEN FINALLY WERE ASKING TO

00:38:14.291 --> 00:38:16.093
ELIMINATE THE ASSETS TEST FOR

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.628

SEVERAL STATES HAVE GONE THIS

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:24.869

00:38:24.935 --> 00:38:26.303
IMPORTANT TESTING GROUND FOR A

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.305
COST BENEFIT BENEFIT ANALYSIS AS

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.675
TO WHETHER AN ASSET TEST

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:31.809
CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE AT ALL.

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:33.244
WE CANNOT AS A STATE

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.046
SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE THE VALUE

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:36.781

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.675
HOME USING THE HOME UPKEEP

00:54:38.742 --> 00:54:40.410
ALLOWANCE.

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:41.411
THE HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCE ALLOWS

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:42.245
A RESIDENT OF A NURSING HOME WHO

00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:44.180
MEETS A SPECIFIC CRITERIA THE

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:45.215
ABILITY TO SPEND MONEY ON THEIR

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:45.982
HOME.

00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.084
THEY WOULD NORMALLY BE USED FOR

00:54:48.151 --> 00:54:48.752
SHARE COST.

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.053
IMAGINE THE RESIDENT WHO IS

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.087
ELIGIBLE TO LIVE AT HOME BUT

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:52.355
CAN'T BECAUSE THEY LOST THEIR

00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:54.024
HOUSE WHILE THEY WERE UNABLE TO

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.992
PAY FOR THE RENT TAXES

00:54:56.059 --> 00:54:57.727
MAINTENANCE ETCETERA.

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:58.795
IF THE HOME UP KEEP ALLOWANCE

00:54:58.862 --> 00:54:59.696
WAS AN AMOUNT ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:00.563
KEEP THEIR HOUSE THEY WOULD BE

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:01.731
OUT OF THE NURSING FACILITY AND

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.099
THE STATE WOULD NOT BE PAYING

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.601
FOR THE HIGH COST.

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:06.636
OF THAT FACILITY AB TEN FORTY

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:07.504
TWO WILL ALLOW NURSING FACILITY

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.305
RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:10.573
THEIR HOMES. TO SAVE MONEY AND

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.342
TRANSITIONAL NEEDS FUND FOR SIX

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:13.410
MONTHS.

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:15.111
THE CONCEPT IS REALLY SIMPLE.

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.246
WHAT NURSING HOME RESIDENTS SAVE

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.614
SOME MONEY FOR A SIX MONTH

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.982
PERIOD TO GET BACK INTO THEIR

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.417
HOMES AND COMMUNITIES?

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:21.818
AND OUT OF A NURSING HOME WHEN

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:22.886
THE DOCTOR CERTIFIES THAT THEY

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:25.622
DO NOT NEED TO BE THERE -- THE

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:27.891
CURRENT HOME UPKEEP ALLOWANCES

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:29.359
TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS IS AN

00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:29.893
UNCHANGED AS THE NINETEEN

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.161
SEVENTIES.

00:55:31.227 --> 00:55:31.861
IF THAT MOUNT HAD BEEN PEGGED TO

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:33.930
INFLATION IT WOULD BE NINE

00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:34.531
HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS.

00:55:34.597 --> 00:55:35.832
BUT INSTEAD IT HAS A CURRENT

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:39.636
BUYING POWER OF LESS THAN.

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:40.270
FORTY FIVE CONSIDERING THAT THE

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:40.804
ORIGINAL INTENT OF THESE

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:41.671
PROVISIONS WAS TO HELP MEDI CAL

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:43.540
RECIPIENTS RETURN TO THEIR HOMES

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.741
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE FORTY FIVE

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:45.809
DOLLARS BE A SUFFICIENT

00:55:45.875 --> 00:55:47.243
SPRINGBOARD TO DO SO.

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:49.112
THE TIME HAS COME TO MOVE

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.080
TOWARDS MAKING THE HOME UPKEEP

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:51.681
ALLOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL.

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:53.249
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO BE

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:54.751
BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN REALIZED --

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:57.587
DISABILITY RIGHTS STRONGLY URGES

00:55:57.654 --> 00:56:02.192
AND I'VE A GOOD AFTERNOON -- I'M

00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:03.793

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:04.194
LAW AND POVERTY.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:04.761
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A HEALTH

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:05.829
CRISIS LANDING SOMEONE IN A

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.597
NURSING HOME CAN COMPLETELY WIPE

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:09.365
OUT SOMEONE'S FINANCES.

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:10.467
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM ALSO

00:56:10.533 --> 00:56:12.168
REQUIRES PEOPLE TO PAY MOST OF

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:14.304
THEIR INCOME WHILE THEY'RE

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.405
RECEIVING NURSING HOME SERVICES.

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:16.573
AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE LAST

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:17.540
FEW YEARS OUR LOCAL LEGAL

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.342
SERVICES PARTNERS HAVE ASSISTED

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:20.310
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BEING

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:22.312
RELEASED FROM NURSING HOMES WITH

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.580
LITERALLY NO WHERE TO GO.

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.115
OUR PARTNERS REPORT PEOPLE WHO

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:26.816
HAVE LEFT THEIR NURSING HOME AND

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.651
WERE RELEASED TO A MOTEL.

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:30.520
A SHELTER OR THE STREET.

00:56:30.587 --> 00:56:31.654
LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE TOOK

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:32.922
IMPORTANT STEPS TO IMPROVE

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:34.724
HOSPITAL DISCHARGE POLICIES FOR

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:36.059
PEOPLE WITH NOWHERE TO GO.

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:37.427
AND MANY ADVOCATES TOLD ME THAT

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.195
WE NEEDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS

00:56:39.262 --> 00:56:39.829
FOR PEOPLE LEAVING NURSING HOME

00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:40.897
CARE.

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:42.298
WELL THE LARGER PROBLEM IS THE

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:43.633
LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.735
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AB TEN

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:46.402
FORTY TWO WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:48.471
ROLE IN PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:50.140
AMONG SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.407
DISABILITIES.

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:52.842
IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:53.610
AMOUNT THAT MEDICARE

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.311
BENEFICIARIES COULD SAVE TO

00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:56.813
PROTECT THEIR EXISTING HOMES.

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.249
AB TEN FORTY TWO WOULD ALSO MAKE

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:01.551
AN IMPORTANT PROOF MAN ON THE

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:02.152

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.520

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.121
TRANSITIONAL NEEDS FUND.

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:05.855
WHEN I ASKED OUR LOCAL LEGAL

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.524
SERVICES ADVOCATES IF THEY WERE

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.691
ABLE TO USE THE HOME ABOUT KEEP

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.660

PRETTY HAVE REPEATED PROBLEM I

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:13.830
HEARD WAS?

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.365
THAT THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.333
SOMEONE TO HAVE A HOME. TOO

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.434
OFTEN THE PEOPLE WE WANT TO HELP

00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:19.536
HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOME

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:20.904
EITHER BEFORE ENTERING THE

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.940

THEM IN THERE.

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.310

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:28.344
ALL THE WAY THERE AND ENSURING

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:29.813

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:32.415

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:33.683
IMPORTANT STEP.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:34.918
BY ALLOWING PEOPLE TO DIVERT

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.252

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.462
DID NOT HAVE A POLICY OR

HONOR THAT BY COMMITTING TO A

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:21.316
SYSTEM THAT EFFECTIVELY

01:20:21.383 --> 01:20:23.018

ACTORS OR IMPROPER CARE EITHER.

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.768
THAT IS WHY THIS BILL WOULD ONLY

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:40.702
IMPACT FACILITIES THAT FAILED TO

FINALLY THERE IS ALSO NO

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.982

FAIR AND REASONABLE -- WE

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:19.367
DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT -- IT IS

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.201
MAKES SENSE TO ROUTE TO RAISE

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.469
THE PENALTIES THEY HAVE NOT BEEN

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.004

AND WE DO.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:25.940
BELIEVE THAT FACILITIES SHOULD

BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHEN THERE

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.011

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:39.587
THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:41.890
WOULD ALLOW A I GUESS CHANGE THE

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:44.659
ABILITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT.

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:44.993
I HAD TO ARE.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:45.593
THE CAUSATION FACTOR FOR THE

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.996

A FACILITY FROM PROXIMATE CAUSE

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:52.567
TO SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:53.935
AND WE HAVE A STRONG CONCERNS

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:55.804
ABOUT HOW THAT WILL IMPACT OUR

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:56.971
NURSING FACILITIES AND THEIR

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:59.207
ABILITY TO REMAIN OPEN AND ALSO

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.675
WITH THEIR ABILITY -- TO HAVE

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.577

AND HE CAN BETTER EXPLAIN ARE

01:23:08.383 --> 01:23:09.684
CONCERNED SPECIFIC TO THAT BUT

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:11.319
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT TO

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.387
IMPORTANT OVERALL -- THINGS

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:14.556
BEFORE WE BEFORE HEADED OVER TO

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:17.092
MARK REAGAN OF FIRST IS THAT --

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.827
THE DISABILITY RIGHTS REPORTS

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:20.829
THAT THEY MENTIONED THAT WAS THE

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:23.064
INSTIGATOR FOR THIS BILL -- HAS

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.532
A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN IT WHICH

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:26.701
WE THINK -- ARE VERY IMPORTANT

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.636
WE AGREE WITH -- THEY TALK ABOUT

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.638
TRANSPARENCY THEY TALK ABOUT --

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:32.173
THE DEPARTMENT BEING MORE

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:33.742
CONSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATION

01:23:33.808 --> 01:23:35.110
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.144
THE MORE CONSISTENT IN THEIR

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.112
APPLICATION A MORE TIMELY IN

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:38.780
THEIR APPLICATION.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:43.084
OF THE USE OF THEIR ENFORCEMENT --

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:43.718
THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT REPORT

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:44.619
THAT EVEN MENTIONS THE

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.588
DIFFERENCE OR THE NEED TO CHANGE --

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.089
THE STANDARD BY WHICH THE

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:49.958
DEPARTMENT DETERMINES A DOUBLE A

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.860
CITATION -- IT MORE TALKS ABOUT

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.361
HOW WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:54.996
DEPARTMENT FOR THEM I TO DO A

01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:56.331
BETTER JOB -- IT'S ALSO

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:57.298
IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.700
THAT THE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM IS

01:23:58.767 --> 01:23:59.601
MEANT TO BE REMEDIAL IT'S

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.803
SUPPOSED TO WORK WITH FACILITIES

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.371
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY PROVIDE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:05.106
BETTER CARE QUALITY CARE --

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:06.941
TIMELINESS IS IMPORTANT MANY

01:24:07.008 --> 01:24:08.576
CITATIONS ARE NOT ISSUED FOR AT

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:10.512
LEAST A YEAR IF NOT FOUR TO SIX

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:12.981
YEARS BY THAT POINT IN TIME.

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:14.716
THE FACILITY HAS MOVED ON FROM

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.084
THAT EVENT -- AND WE'RE NOT

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:17.886
WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR FACILITIES

01:24:17.952 --> 01:24:19.821
IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY CAN

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:20.388
CORRECT AND WORK WITH THE

01:24:20.455 --> 01:24:21.055
DEPARTMENT.

01:24:21.122 --> 01:24:22.657
A TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO A

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.993
BETTER JOB AND LASTLY I THINK

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:26.661
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.196
THAT WEIRD WE HAVE A VERY

01:24:28.263 --> 01:24:30.932
FRAGILE LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM.

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.267
IN CALIFORNIA -- MOST OF OUR

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.935
FACILITIES NURSING FACILITIES

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:36.137

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:39.841
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.409
INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.310
THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:45.480
RELY A 100% ON MEDI CAL FUNDING.

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:48.183
AND WE HAVE A THOUSAND

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.150
INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:50.919
ATTORNEY SIXTY FIVE EVERY YEAR --

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:52.387
WE HAVE MORE CUTE PATIENTS IN

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.721
OUR FACILITIES AND WE REALLY

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:55.256
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:56.991
DETERMINE POLICIES LIKE THIS

01:24:57.058 --> 01:24:59.427
THAT WILL -- IN INCREASE

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:02.464
INCREDIBLY ENHANCE THE ABILITY

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.098
FOR OUR STATE DEPARTMENT TO

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:06.234
ISSUE EE CITATIONS WHICH COULD

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:06.768
PUT FACILITIES AT RISK OF

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.470
CLOSURE WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT

01:25:08.536 --> 01:25:10.171
WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:11.206
VERY CLOSELY SO.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.575
LIKE TO HAND IT OVER TO MARK

01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:15.610
REAGAN TO MAKE A FEW MORE

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:20.281
COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU.

01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:21.883
THANK YOU.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.284
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING IN THIS

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:24.552
AREA I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.054
FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:26.688
JENNIFER SAID I'VE BEEN

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:27.155
REPRESENTING THE STATE

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:28.623
ASSOCIATION.

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:30.024
THE OF THE ISSUE WE'RE TALKING

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:31.426
ABOUT A STRUCTURAL AND I WASN'T

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:32.360
INVOLVED I'VE TRIED MANY OF

01:25:32.427 --> 01:25:33.528
THESE CASES I WASN'T INVOLVED IN

01:25:33.595 --> 01:25:35.330
THE VENTILATOR CASE THAT THERE

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:36.231
WAS JUST SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:36.965
BUT HEARING THE REPORT.

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.066
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS A

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:39.667
FAILURE OF STRUCTURE BUT A

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:42.504
FAILURE BY THE TRIAL JUDGE. TO

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:44.906
DO THE RIGHT THING -- AND I

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.374
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STAY THAT

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:47.375
SAY THAT RIGHT OUT FRONT.

01:25:47.442 --> 01:25:49.577
WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.446
ABOUT THE CHANGE THAT'S BEING

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:52.146
PROPOSED.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.349
IS THAT THE NOTION OF PROXIMATE

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:55.884
CAUSE WHICH IS REALLY THE

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.252
UNDERLYING STANDARD THAT WE'RE

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.220
DISCUSSING IT STYLED AS DIRECT

01:25:59.287 --> 01:26:00.321
PROXIMATE CAUSE WHAT RIGHT THAT

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:02.657
REALLY MEANS IS WHETHER THE

01:26:02.724 --> 01:26:03.992
UNDERLYING INCIDENT.

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.395
WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:09.097
RESIDENTS DEATH.

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.298
IS A LONG STANDING LEGAL

01:26:10.365 --> 01:26:13.401
PRINCIPLE THAT IN NINETEEN

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:14.836
NINETY ONE AS WAS CORRECTLY

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:15.336
STATED.

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:17.539
THERE WAS A STATE SUPREME COURT

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:18.473
DECISION SAYING.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.775
JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON THE FIRST

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.477
PRONG OF THAT TEST.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:25.380
NEED TO BE CLEARER FOR JURIES.

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:26.614
BUT THERE'S TWO PARTS TO A

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:29.017
PROXIMATE CAUSE ANALYSIS HERE'S

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:30.785
THE PROBLEM THAT DEALS WITH

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.587
WHETHER OR NOT.

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.355
THE UNDERLYING CAUSE WAS A

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:36.224
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR AND THEN

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:38.226
BEYOND THAT WHETHER OR NOT THAT

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.795
BECAUSE WAS FORESEEABLE.

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:43.164
WERE PRODUCED THE UNDERLYING

01:26:43.231 --> 01:26:44.432
DEATH AT ISSUE.

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:46.167
IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THERE

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:47.001
WAS A SUBSEQUENT CALIFORNIA

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:48.836
SUPREME COURT DECISION BY THE

01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:50.705
NAME OF PPG INDUSTRIES VERSUS

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:52.907
TRANSAMERICA THAT REAFFIRM THE

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:55.310
PROXIMATE CAUSE IS THE TEST.

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.211
AND IN THE CITATION SYSTEM THAT

01:26:57.278 --> 01:26:58.613
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE NO

01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.948
INJURIES.

01:27:00.014 --> 01:27:01.516
THESE ARE JUDGE TRIALS THEY'VE

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.351
ALWAYS BEEN JUDGE TRIALS AND

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:07.088
JUDGES CAN UNDERSTAND OR SHOULD

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:08.056
UNDERSTAND.

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.891
DESPITE THE LAST EXAMPLE WHAT

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:11.259
PROXIMATE CAUSES ABOUT.

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:13.027
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE WAY THAT

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.696
THE REST OF THE CITATION SYSTEM

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.030
IS STRUCTURED.

01:27:16.097 --> 01:27:18.333
HAS BURDENS THAT IF THIS

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:19.467
AMENDMENT WOULD BE A DROP DEAD

01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:21.836
WOULD TRULY UNDERMINE THE WAY IN

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.571
WHICH THESE CASES GET TRIED AND

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.039
LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN. ONE OF

01:27:25.106 --> 01:27:27.875
THE PREREQUISITES FOR THIS LEVEL

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:31.245
OF CITATION A DOUBLE A CITATION.

01:27:31.312 --> 01:27:33.348
IS THAT THERE BE A VIOLATION OF

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:35.450
THE REGULATIONS THAT RISES TO A

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:38.252
PARTICULAR LEVEL WHERE THERE IS

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.253
AN IMMINENT DANGER OR A

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:42.357
SUBSTANTIAL PROBABILITY OF DEATH

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:43.858
OR SERIOUS HARM.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:45.827
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT PROOF

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:47.228
THAT WOULD REQUIRE FIRST IT'S

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:49.163
IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:52.233
NOTION THAT? TO PROVE THAT YOU

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.869
EVEN CAN PROCEED WITH A DOUBLE A

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:58.706
CITATION THAT YOU HAVE TO PROVE

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.708
VERY IMMINENT.

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:02.276
DANGER OF DEATH AND SO IF YOU

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:03.111
PROVE AN IMMINENT DANGER OF

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:03.344
DEATH.

01:28:03.411 --> 01:28:04.946
BUT THEN YOU ONLY HAVE TO PROVE

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:08.182
THAT THAT THAT THAT BECAUSE WAS

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:10.418
HE A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR.

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:12.887
YOU'VE NOT REALLY TAKEN ACTION

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:13.454
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:14.155
SYSTEM.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.857
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:18.326
UNDERSTAND HERE THAT THE MOST

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:20.194
IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTIC TO MAKE

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:23.097
THE SYSTEM FAIR FOR ALL FOR BOTH

WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.228
ABOUT THE THIS IS THE CHANGE IN

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.362
THE STANDARD COMPONENT OF THE

STANDARD.

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:47.101
IN YOUR VIEW IS THE SUBSTANTIAL

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:48.936
FACTOR STANDARD.

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:50.471
A LOWER STANDARD.

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:51.973
THAN THE DIRECT PROXIMATE CAUSE

AND CERTAINLY MORE CLEAR DOES

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:03.784
PROVIDE MORE CLARITY -- BUT

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:05.386
CERTAINLY AND THAT'S PART OF THE

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:06.320
REASON WHY THE DEPARTMENT --

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.022
PREFERS IT AND AND IN SUPPORT OF

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.457
THIS CHANGE BECAUSE OF IT

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:10.958
PROVIDES GREATER CLARITY FOR

01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:13.828
THEM AS WELL AND SO -- IT'S IT'S

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:14.295
ALSO.

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:16.264
A MORE COMMON PLACE USE STANDARD

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:18.132
AND BUT ONE THAT WILL CREATE

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:23.471
SOME CONSISTENCY WITH HOW THE

01:32:23.537 --> 01:32:23.771
DEPARTMENT.

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.073
OF THE IN TERMS OF THE STANDARD

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.708
THE DEPARTMENT USES AS WELL AS

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:29.644
THE COURTS DEPARTMENTS RULINGS

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:30.745
APPEALED IT GOES THE COURTS%

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:34.749
USING THE SAME STANDARDS

01:32:34.815 --> 01:32:35.249
CRITICAL IN THAT SENSE.

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:35.816
OKAY.

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:37.018
AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.352
ARGUMENT MADE BY THE OPPOSITION

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:39.987
THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.255
IS THAT IS MEANT TO BE A TWO

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:42.390
PART TEST.

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:46.460
AND THIS TAKES -- JUST THE FIRST

01:32:46.527 --> 01:32:50.665
PART OF A TWO PART TEST IT.

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:51.866
ANY ANY REFLECTION MORE TALK ANA

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:52.900
WHAT WILL LET'S KEEP IN MIND

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:54.001
THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A WIDE

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:54.869
DISCRETION WITH THE DEPARTMENT

01:32:54.936 --> 01:32:55.469
OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND I THINK

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:55.670
THAT.

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:58.039
pSTANDARD.

01:32:58.105 --> 01:32:59.507
NARROWS THEIR DISCRETION IN

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:01.008
TERMS OF REALLY BE ABLE TO TAKE

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:02.276
INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE FACTS OF AN

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:03.711
INDIVIDUAL CASE AND THAT'S WHY

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.112
THERE'S SO MANY CASES THAT ARE

01:33:05.179 --> 01:33:07.515
SUCCESSFUL APPEALS 77%.

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:09.317
ARE SAYS ONE APPEAL BECAUSE

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:10.551
THAT'S A VERY NARROW STANDARD

01:33:10.618 --> 01:33:12.553
THIS IS DENTAL FACTOR STANDARD

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:14.322
IS A MORE COMMONLY USED AND

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:15.189
BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:15.957
HAVE.

01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.358
A GREATER ABILITY AND IN THIS

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.192
CASE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.927
ABLE TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:20.828
DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTICULAR

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:22.129
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES FALLS INTO

01:33:22.196 --> 01:33:28.135
THAT CATEGORY OR NOT.

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:30.171
AND AND AS SUGGESTED BY THE

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:31.839
OPPOSITION BY INCREASING THE

01:33:31.906 --> 01:33:33.774
FINES AND FEES -- THE THE FINES

01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:35.476
FOR THE THE CLASS A LEVEL IT

01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:39.313
ALSO GIVES -- SOME SORT OF SELF

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.782
OF OF ASSURANCE SOME ASSURANCES

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.384
FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY DO

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.886
DROP IT DOWN AT THE PENALTIES

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.655
NOT SOON BE AS A KIND OF A SLAP

01:33:47.722 --> 01:33:48.622
ON THE WRIST THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:49.190
COULD BE A MORE.

01:33:49.256 --> 01:33:51.125
SUBSTANTIVE COUNTY SO I THINK

01:33:51.192 --> 01:33:52.526
COMBINING BOTH USING A

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:53.661
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR AND

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.429
INCREASING THE PENALTIES FOR

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:56.097
CLASS A. IN THESE TYPES OF CASES

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:57.598
REALLY PROVIDES KIND OF THE

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:57.832
TOOLS.

01:33:57.898 --> 01:34:00.167
NECESSARY FOR THE DEPARTMENT --

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:02.236
TO BUT HAVE THE THE FEE OR THE

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:11.045
PENALTY FIT THE INCIDENT AT HAND

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:11.345
[inaudible]

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:12.046
MAC [inaudible]

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.948
I'M.

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:15.549
IF I UNDERSTAND THE MAGIC

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:16.917
ADDRESSES GONZALEZ CASE OUT

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:18.919
CORRECTLY THAT WAS ABOUT JURY

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:19.620
INSTRUCTIONS.

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.489
AND AND MAKING IT CLEAR FOR A

01:34:21.555 --> 01:34:24.392
JURY YOU KNOW A POOL OF IN A

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.359
CROSS SECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY.

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:25.826
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:26.360
INSTRUCTIONS CLEAR TO THEM

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:26.660
[inaudible]

01:34:26.727 --> 01:34:30.498
BUT THE THE DETERMINAR THE FINAL

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:31.799
FACTOR THAT THAT THE THE PERSON

01:34:31.866 --> 01:34:33.634
MAKES DECISIONS AND AND THE CASE

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:36.504
IS AT HAND IS IT OUR JUDGE.

01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:37.972
RIGHT SO [inaudible]

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:38.806
IS IS.

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:41.642
IS IT LESS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:43.010
YEAH THAT IS THE RATIONALE

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:44.445
BEHIND MITCHELL VERSUS GONZALEZ.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.614
NOT AS PERSUASIVE IF WERE

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.783
TALKING ABOUT A JUDGE.

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.217
WHO UNDERSTANDS THE NUANCES

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:51.285
BETWEEN DIFFERENT STANDARDS

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:52.253
PROBABLY BETTER THAN A LAY

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.854
PERSON WITHOUT LEGAL TRAINING --

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.389
AND AND THEN MAKE IT LESS

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:56.624
NECESSARY TO HAVE A A

01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:57.558
SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR TEST BECAUSE

01:34:57.625 --> 01:34:58.392
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THE WHOLE

01:34:58.459 --> 01:34:59.427
RATIONALE BEHIND MITCHELL VERSES

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:00.661
GONZALEZ WAS CLARITY FOR

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:02.463
LAYPEOPLE WHEN RECEIVING A JURY

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.465
INSTRUCTION.

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:06.300
I DON'T I THINK IN EITHER CASE

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.234
ESSENTIAL FACTORS MORE

01:35:07.301 --> 01:35:09.804
APPROPRIATE STANDARD IT ALLOWS.

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.305
IN EITHER CASE YOU KNOW THE

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:12.606
JUDGE AND THE JUDGE IS THE

01:35:12.673 --> 01:35:13.174
ARBITER IN THAT CASE THEY'RE

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.475
GONNA BE ABLE TO APPLY IT IN A

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:15.843
WAY THAT MAKES SENSE BUT THE

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:16.744
DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE.

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.579
IS TO HAVE A SIMILAR STANDARD

01:35:18.646 --> 01:35:19.213
BECAUSE SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR FOR

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.215
THEM MAKES MORE SENSE AND IT'S

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:23.918
CONSISTENT WITH -- THE CASE LAW

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:28.155
AS WELL SO IT'S IT'S A KIND OF A

01:35:28.222 --> 01:35:29.290
BOTH OF THE CONSISTENCY ARGUMENT

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:31.292
AS WELL AS A STAND THAT MAKES

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.294
MORE SENSE FOR THEM AND THAT'S

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.028
WHY THEY SUPPORT IT.

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:36.030
AND AND I THE WAY A JUDGE AGAIN

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:38.132
UP EVEN -- EVEN IF WHETHER IT'S

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.500
A COURT TRIAL OR A JURY TRIAL I

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.969
THE WAY THE STANDARD SHOULD BE

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:44.071
CLEAR AND CONSISTENT.

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:45.306
THANK YOU MISTER CARR THAT SUPER

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.440
HELPFUL AND ANSWERED ONE FINAL

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.575
QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S

01:35:47.641 --> 01:35:48.742
BEEN SOME REFERENCE TO THE AUDIT.

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:49.343
AND I BELIEVE THE AUDIT MADE

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:50.578
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:52.246
BEYOND WHAT YOUR BILL

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:53.914
CONTEMPLATES A THERE IS A REASON

01:35:53.981 --> 01:35:55.583
THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT THOSE.

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:58.018
ISSUES IN THE AUDIT WERE WORTH

01:35:58.085 --> 01:35:59.086
PURSUING MAYBE YOU KNOW I KNOW

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:03.524
OF ONE BILL CAN DO EVERYTHING

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.626
BUT I JUST WANT TO ASK.

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:06.994
I'LL BUT MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE TO

01:36:07.061 --> 01:36:08.095
PURSUE THEM WHAT DID YOU THINK

01:36:08.162 --> 01:36:09.763
THAT THEY WEREN'T APPROPRIATE.

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.132
THIS IT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:12.433
THIS ISSUE IS ONE THAT I WAS

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.034
WORKING ON WHEN THE AUDIT CAME

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:17.404
OUT -- KIND OF MID STREAM AND SO --

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:19.373
I CATERED THE BILL -- AND AND

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.574
DIRECTED THE BILL WORKING WITH

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:21.842
THE DEPARTMENT IN THE DIRECTION

01:36:21.909 --> 01:36:23.110
OF THE AUDIT BASED UPON WHAT I

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:25.079
WAS ALREADY WORKING ON SO --

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:26.447
RATHER THAN ADDING EXTRA STUFF

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:27.481
TO IT WHICH I THINK IS NOT ONLY

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:30.484
INEFFICIENT BUT ALSO -- YOU KNOW

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:33.020
IT COULD BE CONSIDERED -- I I

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:36.357
THINK -- WEALTH IS NOT I I DON'T

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:36.991
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:39.627
BILLS IS THAT NOT A COMES OUT

01:36:39.693 --> 01:36:41.195
KIND OF MISTREATMENT US TO STORE

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:41.762
THE KITCHEN SINK IN THERE.

01:36:41.829 --> 01:36:42.730
THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY WERE

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:43.564
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT OUT

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:44.932
THAT IN THAT AUDIT I KNOW THAT

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:46.333
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CHAIR

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:46.867
AND MANY OTHERS ARE VERY

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.402
INTERESTED IN BECAUSE THEY CARE

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:48.936
ABOUT THE ISSUE OF WHAT'S

01:36:49.003 --> 01:36:49.703
HAPPENING.

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.706
IN THE FACILITIES -- AND A MANY

01:36:52.773 --> 01:36:53.541
THE AUTOMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS

01:36:53.607 --> 01:36:55.943
THE OUR OUR OPPOSITION ALSO --

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:58.078
AND HAS TAKEN TO HEART AND IS

01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.547
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AS

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:01.148
WELL SO IT'S NOT A SITUATION

01:37:01.215 --> 01:37:01.949
WHERE WE HAVE ALL THESE

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:03.984
RECOMMENDATIONS AND ASSIST TO

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.319
TEN BILLS AND AND I THINK A LOT

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:06.120
OF THAT CAN BE DONE.

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:06.954
BUT THE DEPARTMENT WORKING

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:09.056
DIRECTLY WITH -- BUT THE

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:11.058
INDUSTRY ITSELF AND FOR THOSE

01:37:11.125 --> 01:37:12.092
THAT CANNOT THAT I'M SURE

01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:14.695
THEY'LL BE SUBSEQUENT LETS

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:24.004

HELPFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND

AS WAS POINT HAS BEEN POINTED

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:16.257

02:22:17.028 --> 02:22:17.595
ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT MY NAME IS

02:22:17.662 --> 02:22:18.997
ERIC LEE AND I'M A PHD STUDENT

02:22:19.063 --> 02:22:20.932
STUDYING MICROBIOLOGY AT UC

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.066
BERKELEY.

02:22:22.133 --> 02:22:23.234
I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I

02:22:23.301 --> 02:22:25.203
PARTICIPATED IN A COMPETITION

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.804
HOSTED BY THE UC CENTER OF

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:28.039
SACRAMENTO.

PROPOSE NEW POLICY IDEAS.

02:22:38.216 --> 02:22:40.051
MY PROPOSAL WAS SELECTED AS THE

02:22:40.118 --> 02:22:42.253
WINNING PROPOSAL AND IS THE IDEA

02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:44.489
BEHIND AB.

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:45.023
ELEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT AS A

02:22:45.089 --> 02:22:46.724
RESEARCHER WHO STUDIES BACTERIA

02:22:46.791 --> 02:22:47.926
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE OFTEN

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:49.294
ASKED ME WHETHER THEY SHOULD

02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.296
TAKE OVER THE COUNTER PROBIOTICS

02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:52.897
OR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS THAT

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:54.465
CONTAIN LIKE LIVE MICRO

02:22:54.532 --> 02:22:55.900
ORGANISMS TO TREAT HEALTH

02:22:55.967 --> 02:22:57.502
PROBLEMS.

02:22:57.568 --> 02:22:58.503
I'M USUALLY HESITANT TO ANSWER

02:22:58.569 --> 02:23:00.338
THAT QUESTION BECAUSE EVERY

02:23:00.405 --> 02:23:02.240
PERSON HAS A UNIQUE MIXTURE OF

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:03.207
TRILLIONS OF BACTERIA IN THEIR

02:23:03.274 --> 02:23:04.776
GUT.

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:06.010
WHICH CAN CHANGE PROBIOTICS

02:23:06.077 --> 02:23:06.978
EFFECTIVENESS FROM PERSON TO

02:23:07.045 --> 02:23:08.947
PERSON.

02:23:09.013 --> 02:23:11.282
FURTHERMORE EVEN IF A CURE ALL

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:13.217
BACTERIA EXISTED I WOULDN'T BE

02:23:13.284 --> 02:23:14.719
ABLE TO PICK IT OFF THE SHELF OF

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:16.521
MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE BECAUSE

02:23:16.587 --> 02:23:17.855
MOST SUPPLEMENT LABELS DON'T

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:19.891
HAVE ENOUGH DETAIL FOR ME TO

02:23:19.958 --> 02:23:22.060
FIND A THAT BACTERIA.

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:23.728
MOST LABELS INCLUDE BACTERIA

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:24.963
SPECIES.

02:23:25.029 --> 02:23:26.731
BUT SCIENTISTS PREFER TO USE AN

02:23:26.798 --> 02:23:28.466
ADDITIONAL LABEL LAYER OF

02:23:28.533 --> 02:23:30.134
SPECIFICITY WHICH IS CALLED THE

02:23:30.201 --> 02:23:31.402
STRAIN.

02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:33.171
YOU CAN THINK OF BACTERIAL

02:23:33.237 --> 02:23:34.672
STRAINS LIKE BREEDS OF DOGS.

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:36.941
ALL DOGS ARE THE SAME SPECIES

02:23:37.008 --> 02:23:38.276
BUT IF YOU IMAGINE THE DOCKS IN

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:40.078
AS A POLICE CANINE YOU CAN

02:23:40.144 --> 02:23:41.746
UNDERSTAND WHY SPECIFICITY

02:23:41.813 --> 02:23:43.614
PASSED THE SPECIES LEVEL IS

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:44.882
IMPORTANT.

02:23:44.949 --> 02:23:47.185
SIMILARLY A BACTERIA STRAIN CAN

02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:48.786
IMPACT ITS FUNCTION.

02:23:48.853 --> 02:23:50.488
SOME STRAINS OF E. COLI OUR FOOD

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:52.991
CONTAMINANTS CAUSING DIARRHEA

02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.926
KIDNEY FAILURE OR DEATH.

02:23:54.993 --> 02:23:56.761
OTHER E. COLI CAN HELP TREAT

02:23:56.828 --> 02:23:58.930
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE.

02:23:58.997 --> 02:24:00.231
DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:02.033
BACTERIA STRAIN THAT INFORMATION

02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:04.168
IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE LISTED ON

02:24:04.235 --> 02:24:05.336
A MANUFACTURED.

02:24:05.403 --> 02:24:07.071
MANUFACTURER LABEL UNDER CURRENT

02:24:07.138 --> 02:24:08.539
FEDERAL LAW.

02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:09.841
CURRENTLY ABEL'S ALSO LIST

02:24:09.907 --> 02:24:12.043
PROBIOTIC INGREDIENTS BY WEIGHT

02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:14.145
WHICH COUNTS BOTH LIVE AND DEAD

02:24:14.212 --> 02:24:16.614
ORGANISMS. TO FIND THE NUMBER OF

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:18.383
VIABLE MICRO ORGANISMS WILL

02:24:18.449 --> 02:24:19.784
CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONALLY TO

02:24:19.851 --> 02:24:20.952
TRANSPARENCY AND PRODUCT

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:23.021
INTEGRITY.

02:24:23.087 --> 02:24:24.689
THE US PROBIOTIC MARKET IS

02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:25.923
PROJECTED TO REACH SIX AND A

02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:27.392
HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:28.860
FOUR YEARS.

02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:30.461
THE COST ALONE SHOULD BE AN

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:31.829
INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE LABELING

02:24:31.896 --> 02:24:33.765
PRACTICES SO CONSUMERS CAN KNOW

02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:35.133
EXACTLY WHAT'S IN THEIR

02:24:35.199 --> 02:24:36.300
SUPPLEMENTS.

02:24:36.367 --> 02:24:37.769
MORE DETAILED STREAM LEVEL

02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:39.404
LABELING WILL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO

02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:40.438
COMPARE PRODUCTS BETWEEN

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:42.407
MANUFACTURERS AND ENSURE THAT

02:24:42.473 --> 02:24:44.275
THIS CRUCIAL INFORMATION IS

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:45.777
READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL.

02:24:45.843 --> 02:24:46.744
THANK YOU.

02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:52.283
YOU VERY MUCH.

02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:53.951
AB.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:54.185
MANNER.

02:24:54.252 --> 02:24:56.120
YEAH.

02:24:56.187 --> 02:24:57.622
THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR -- AND

02:24:57.688 --> 02:24:58.589
COMMITTEE FOR LETTING ME SPEAK

02:24:58.656 --> 02:24:59.490
TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL.

02:24:59.557 --> 02:25:01.726
MY NAME IS ZACH ABIT -- AND I AM

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:02.760
CEO OF HIM JUST GO BASED

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:03.528
PROBIOTICS COMPANY CALLED THE

02:25:03.594 --> 02:25:04.662
BIOTICS.

02:25:04.729 --> 02:25:06.364
AS YOU MAY KNOW PROBIOTICS ARE

02:25:06.431 --> 02:25:08.232
LIVE ORGANISMS THAT ARE CONSUMED

02:25:08.299 --> 02:25:09.100
FOR THE VARIOUS BENEFITS THAT

02:25:09.167 --> 02:25:11.702
THEY MAKE HIM.

02:25:11.769 --> 02:25:12.703
FOR THIS ISSUE OUT HIS ME THE

02:25:12.770 --> 02:25:14.705
ISSUE IS THAT NOT ALL PROBIOTICS

02:25:14.772 --> 02:25:16.707
ARE THE SAME AS WE JUST HEARD ON

02:25:16.774 --> 02:25:18.342
AND NOT ALL COME FOR THE SAME

02:25:18.409 --> 02:25:19.844
BENEFITS TO THE SAME PEOPLE.

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:21.012
ARE THE FIRST PROVISION OF THIS

02:25:21.079 --> 02:25:22.680
BILL REQUIRES THAT THE GENUS

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:23.815
SPECIES AND STRAINED BE

02:25:23.881 --> 02:25:26.451
SPECIFIED ON THE LABEL THIS IS

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:27.985
CRITICAL FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

02:25:28.052 --> 02:25:29.420
FIRST DIFFERENT STRAINS OF

02:25:29.487 --> 02:25:31.389
BACTERIA EVEN WITHIN THE SAME

02:25:31.456 --> 02:25:32.857
SPECIES VERY WIDELY.

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:34.125
THE DISTINCTION ABOUT WHAT

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:35.493
STRAIN SPECIFICALLY IS IN THE

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.361
PRODUCT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:37.962
FOR PROBIOTICS BUSINESSES LIKE

02:25:38.029 --> 02:25:40.031
MINE. ONE STRAIN WITHIN A

02:25:40.098 --> 02:25:41.732
SPECIES MAY HAVE A BENEFICIAL

02:25:41.799 --> 02:25:43.434
FUNCTION ACTIVITY ANOTHER STRAIN

02:25:43.501 --> 02:25:46.237
DOES NOT HAVE. FOR INSTANCE WE

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:48.039
SPENT THE LAST THREE YEARS ARE

02:25:48.106 --> 02:25:49.407
DEVELOPING AND TESTING ARE

02:25:49.474 --> 02:25:51.175
SPECIFIC STRAIN OF A PROBIOTIC

02:25:51.242 --> 02:25:53.010
CALL BE SETTLES.

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:55.746
OUR STRAIN B. SUBTLEST ZB.

02:25:55.813 --> 02:25:56.848
ONE EIGHTY THREE IT HAS A UNIQUE

02:25:56.914 --> 02:25:57.949
FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS IT TO

02:25:58.015 --> 02:25:59.350
ELIMINATE A SPECIFIC TOXIN FROM

02:25:59.417 --> 02:26:00.952
YOUR GOT.

02:26:01.018 --> 02:26:02.587
OTHER STRAINS OF BE SUBTLEST DO

02:26:02.653 --> 02:26:03.888
NOT HAVE THIS FUNCTION.

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:05.223
AND WITHOUT A REQUIREMENT FOR

02:26:05.289 --> 02:26:06.624
MANDATORY STRAIN LABELING

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:08.159
BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE THE

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:10.795
RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW OR LABEL

02:26:10.862 --> 02:26:13.164
WHETHER OR NOT -- THEY HAVE A

02:26:13.231 --> 02:26:15.099
FUNCTIONAL OR USEFUL STREAM.

02:26:15.166 --> 02:26:16.300
BUSINESSES SUCH AS MINE ARE

02:26:16.367 --> 02:26:17.735
PREDICATED ON THE FACT THAT ONE

02:26:17.802 --> 02:26:19.170
STRAIN IS NOT THE SAME AS

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:19.937
ANOTHER.

02:26:20.004 --> 02:26:21.339
AND THERE'S A VERY AND THERE'S

02:26:21.405 --> 02:26:21.939
VERY SOUND SCIENCE TO SUPPORT

02:26:22.006 --> 02:26:23.074
THAT.

02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:24.876
WE GO THROUGH A GREAT DEAL OF

02:26:24.942 --> 02:26:26.144
SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN RIGOR TO

02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:28.412
ISOLATE DEVELOPING CHARACTER AYE

02:26:28.479 --> 02:26:30.014
STRAINS AND FILE PATENTS TO

02:26:30.081 --> 02:26:31.115
PROTECT THE STRAINS FOR THE

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:32.984
PURPOSES OF EXCLUSIVE USE.

02:26:33.050 --> 02:26:33.784
WITHOUT MANDATORY STRAIN

IS NOT A SCIENCE AT ALL -- BUT

02:32:09.687 --> 02:32:11.322
MY MY QUESTION FOR THE

02:32:11.388 --> 02:32:14.191
OPPOSITION IS -- I DO UNDERSTAND --

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:17.561
THE ROLE OF THE OF US GOVERNMENT --

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:18.896
AND I'M SOMEBODY WHO DEEPLY

02:32:18.963 --> 02:32:20.598
BELIEVES IN THIS IDEA OF

02:32:20.664 --> 02:32:21.699

02:32:21.765 --> 02:32:24.935
AND OFTEN TIMES -- WE HAVE --

02:32:25.002 --> 02:32:26.270
FOLKS THAT COME DOESN'T SAY --

02:32:26.337 --> 02:32:27.705
WE DON'T WANT CALIFORNIA TO SET

02:32:27.771 --> 02:32:29.406
THEIR OWN -- STANDARDS OUR OWN

02:32:29.473 --> 02:32:31.108
RULES WE WANT THEM CONGRESS TO

02:32:31.175 --> 02:32:33.344
DO IT WE WANT WASHINGTON DC TO

DOING MUCH OF OF ANYTHING AND I

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:36.981
KNOW THAT YOU'RE.

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:38.449
HOPING THAT THE FDA WHICH IS ONE

02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:40.284
OF THE AGENCIES WILL WILL COME

02:32:40.351 --> 02:32:42.186
UP WITH -- WILL COME UP WITH

02:32:42.253 --> 02:32:43.554
SOMETHING BUT WHY CAN'T

02:32:43.621 --> 02:32:45.322
CALIFORNIA HAVE ITS OWN RULES

02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:49.560
AND IF YOU AGREE THAT -- THAT

02:32:49.627 --> 02:32:50.661
DOCTOR COURTS BILL -- IS MOVING

02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:52.730
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WHY CAN'T

02:32:52.796 --> 02:32:53.998
WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA STANDARD

02:32:54.064 --> 02:32:55.833
THE THAT AND WRITE IT HERE THAT

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.034
THE FDA CAN USE IT AS A AS A

02:32:57.101 --> 02:32:58.168
GUIDELINE.

02:32:58.235 --> 02:32:59.203
YEAH I MEAN IT'S A GOOD QUESTION

02:32:59.270 --> 02:33:00.571
WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE CALIFORNIA

CAN DO.

02:33:01.605 --> 02:33:02.940
WHAT IT WANTS AND IT AND IT'S

02:33:03.007 --> 02:33:04.708
AND IT'S DOING THAT RIGHT NOW I

02:33:04.775 --> 02:33:05.743
THINK THAT THE ISSUES THAT

02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:07.177
TYPICALLY WHEN WE SEE NEW

02:33:07.244 --> 02:33:09.313

02:33:09.380 --> 02:33:10.347
REQUIREMENTS?

02:33:10.414 --> 02:33:11.282
WHAT WE'RE TYPICALLY SEEING IS

02:33:11.348 --> 02:33:13.083
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOING THE

02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:14.518
OPPOSITE DIRECTION OR TAKING NO

02:33:14.585 --> 02:33:16.487
ACTION AT ALL THAT'S NOT WHAT'S

02:33:16.554 --> 02:33:18.122
HAPPENING HERE WE JUST SAW FTA

02:33:18.188 --> 02:33:20.291
TAKE ACTION?

02:33:20.357 --> 02:33:20.991
ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL.

02:33:21.058 --> 02:33:23.394
AS EARLY AS LATE LAST YEAR AND

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:24.795
WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO

02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:26.196
MOVE FORWARD WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT

02:33:26.263 --> 02:33:27.798
THEY DO AND THE FACT THAT FTA IS

02:33:27.865 --> 02:33:32.236
GOING IN THEIR DIRECTION.

02:33:32.303 --> 02:33:33.070
THAT WE WANT THEM TO GO IN

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:33.671
CONSISTENT WITH THIS BILL OUR

02:33:33.737 --> 02:33:34.405
POSITION IS THAT IT WOULD BE

02:33:34.471 --> 02:33:36.206
NICE TO JUST HAVE A UNIFORM

02:33:36.273 --> 02:33:37.741
FEDERAL STANDARDS.

02:33:37.808 --> 02:33:39.510
THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BE GET

02:33:39.577 --> 02:33:40.044
BEHIND IT THAT WE CAN ALL

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:41.011
SUPPORT.

02:33:41.078 --> 02:33:43.380
IF FTA WAS NOT MOVING ON THIS

02:33:43.447 --> 02:33:45.382
AND THEY WERE GOING THE OPPOSITE

02:33:45.449 --> 02:33:47.217
DIRECTION SAYING CALLING FORMING

02:33:47.284 --> 02:33:48.352
UNITS.

02:33:48.419 --> 02:33:48.919
COUNTY FORMING UNITS IS NOT

02:33:48.986 --> 02:33:51.622
APPROPRIATE METRICS.

02:33:51.689 --> 02:33:53.190
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GOT UP HERE

02:33:53.257 --> 02:33:55.593
AND AND AND JUSTIFY THAT WHEN

02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:57.328
WHEN CALIFORNIA SEEKING TO GO IN

02:33:57.394 --> 02:33:58.128
THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

02:33:58.195 --> 02:33:59.330
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH A FIFTY

02:33:59.396 --> 02:34:00.864
DOESN'T MOVE WHAT IF THEY DON'T

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:02.232
ACT WOULD BE IMPROPER FOR

02:34:02.299 --> 02:34:03.667
CALIFORNIA TO ACT WOULD YOU

02:34:03.734 --> 02:34:04.234
STILL BE WOULD BE SUPPORT

02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:05.903
SUPPORTED THAT THE FDA IF YOU

02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:07.571
KNEW THE FDA WASN'T I'M GOING TO

02:34:07.638 --> 02:34:08.405
ACT WOULD YOU STILL WANT TO BE

02:34:08.472 --> 02:34:09.206
SUPPORTIVE.

02:34:09.273 --> 02:34:10.274
I THINK WE LIKE TO SEE AFTER

02:34:10.341 --> 02:34:13.444
GIVE FTA THE CHANCE GIVEN THAT

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:14.912
THEY'RE GETTING.

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:15.546
LOS WE THINK ALLOW THAT TO TAKE

02:34:15.613 --> 02:34:16.113
ITS COURSE AND IF THEY DON'T

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:17.348
TAKE ACTION.

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:18.515
THAT WE MAY FIND OURSELVES HERE

02:34:18.582 --> 02:34:20.250
AGAIN NEXT YEAR AND AND GO FROM

02:34:20.317 --> 02:34:22.186
THERE COULD BE AMENDED THE BILL

02:34:22.252 --> 02:34:23.921
AMEND LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT

02:34:23.988 --> 02:34:24.855
WOULD SAY THAT IF THE FDA DID

02:34:24.922 --> 02:34:26.457
ACT -- THAN -- THAT WOULD SORT

02:34:26.523 --> 02:34:28.993
SUPER CEDAR -- BUT WOULD YOU BE

02:34:29.059 --> 02:34:30.794
SUPPORTIVE OF OF OF THAT SO IN

02:34:30.861 --> 02:34:32.463
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT MAYBE THE

02:34:32.529 --> 02:34:32.963
FDA WON'T.

02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:35.065
ACT WE STILL HAVE THE CALIFORNIA

02:34:35.132 --> 02:34:35.599
RULE.

02:34:35.666 --> 02:34:37.601
I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:39.570
WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE FDA'S

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:41.405
GOING IN THIS GENERAL DIRECTION

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:42.039
AND THEY COULD HAVE A PROVISION

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:43.273
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:44.508
AND AND IT MIGHT NOT BE

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:46.310
OBJECTIONABLE BUT IT WOULD BE

02:34:46.377 --> 02:34:47.044
ONE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

02:34:47.111 --> 02:34:48.812
CREATE CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS.

02:34:48.879 --> 02:34:50.014
AND SO I'D RATHER SEE THE LETTER

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:52.783
THE FDA PROCESS TAKE ITS COURSE.

02:34:52.850 --> 02:34:54.652
SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE AND AGAIN

02:34:54.718 --> 02:34:56.420
IF THEY DON'T MOVE IN THEY DON'T

02:34:56.487 --> 02:34:58.222
GO IN THAT DIRECTION AND TO THE

02:34:58.288 --> 02:34:58.922
EXTENT.

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:00.057
CALIFORNIA WHICH IS TO DO A

02:35:00.124 --> 02:35:02.026
RESOLUTION URGING THE FDA TO DO

02:35:02.092 --> 02:35:03.560
THAT ESPECIALLY WITH THE

02:35:03.627 --> 02:35:05.062
PRESENCE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENT.

02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:06.630
COMPANIES IN THIS STATE AND THEY

02:35:06.697 --> 02:35:08.165
DON'T GO THAT DIRECTION.

02:35:08.232 --> 02:35:09.600
THAT'S THEIR DECISION WE HOPE

02:35:09.667 --> 02:35:10.934
THAT THEY WOULD AND IF THEY

02:35:11.001 --> 02:35:12.536
DIDN'T WE AGAIN LIKE I SAID CAN

02:35:12.603 --> 02:35:15.272
FIND OURSELVES BACK HERE AND

02:35:15.339 --> 02:35:15.806
HAVE THE DISCUSSION YEAH.

02:35:15.873 --> 02:35:16.940
OKAY [inaudible]

02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:20.444
OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:35:20.511 --> 02:35:22.446
I I HAVE TO FIND THIS A

02:35:22.513 --> 02:35:25.849
FASCINATING DISCUSSION -- THE

02:35:25.916 --> 02:35:28.152
SUBJECT MATTER ANOTHER DOCTOR

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:32.890
THE LACK OF SCIENCE OVER HERE --

02:35:32.956 --> 02:35:35.559
I THINK THAT I I I I APPRECIATE

02:35:35.626 --> 02:35:36.927
WITH THE OPPOSITION IS IS IS

02:35:36.994 --> 02:35:38.629
COMING FROM BUT I ALSO HAVE TO

02:35:38.696 --> 02:35:40.097
RAISE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT

02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:41.899
MIGHT CULTURE DID -- OR MY

02:35:41.965 --> 02:35:42.900
MOISTURE DID AND THAT'S FREE

02:35:42.966 --> 02:35:45.002
WITH REGARDS TO WHAT IF THE FDA

02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:47.971
DOESN'T ACT -- WE IN THE

02:35:48.038 --> 02:35:49.473
LEGISLATURE HERE WE'RE DEALING --

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:51.575
WAITING FOR THE FDA TO ACT ON E.

02:35:51.642 --> 02:35:53.243
CIGARETTES -- AND COMING OUT

02:35:53.310 --> 02:35:54.344
WITH CONCLUSIONS ABOUT E.

02:35:54.411 --> 02:35:56.180
CIGARETTES AND WE WAITED AND

02:35:56.246 --> 02:35:57.581
NOTHING HAPPENED AND WE ALSO

02:35:57.648 --> 02:35:58.816
REALLY TOOK ACTION HERE IN THE

02:35:58.882 --> 02:36:00.017
STATE LEGISLATURE AND THEN THE

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:02.019
FDA DID ULTIMATELY.

02:36:02.086 --> 02:36:03.887
MAKE SOME CONCLUSIONS THERE -- I

02:36:03.954 --> 02:36:06.623
KNOW MR QUIRK IS A SCIENTIST --

02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:07.925
AND I KNOW THAT MR QUIRK

02:36:07.991 --> 02:36:10.861
APPRECIATES THE VALUE OF OF DATA

02:36:10.928 --> 02:36:13.263

PRETTY AND I KNOW HE APPRECIATES

02:36:22.873 --> 02:36:24.074
FOR STATES THAT -- MY HOPE IS

02:36:24.141 --> 02:36:26.543
THAT -- THIS IF THE BILL MOVES

02:36:26.610 --> 02:36:29.546
FORWARD THAT -- HE'LL BE MINDFUL

02:36:29.613 --> 02:36:31.248
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE FDA

02:36:31.315 --> 02:36:32.816
AND THAT IF THERE IS A CONFLICT

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:34.118
THAT THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY

02:36:34.184 --> 02:36:36.053
RESOLVED BUT I SEE AN

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:37.921
OVERWHELMING CONSIDERATION FOR

02:36:37.988 --> 02:36:39.690
THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION TO

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:40.991

WAS GOING TO ACT ANYTIME SOON --

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:48.799
IF THEY DO -- THAT I APOLOGIZE

02:36:48.866 --> 02:36:50.200
FOR THAT MIS CHARACTERIZATION

02:36:50.267 --> 02:36:52.236
BUT THE TRACK RECORD IS IS NOT

02:36:52.302 --> 02:36:53.403

SEVENTY TWO KIND OF NEGOTIATIONS.

03:27:18.726 --> 03:27:19.994
WHAT WE REALLY TRY TO DO IS

03:27:20.060 --> 03:27:21.362
CRAFT SOMETHING THAT WAS BOTH

03:27:21.428 --> 03:27:23.831
BALANCED WHERE PLANS AND

03:27:23.898 --> 03:27:26.500
PROVIDERS BOTH HAD A MECHANISM

03:27:26.567 --> 03:27:28.235
TO ENSURE THAT A FAIR AND

03:27:28.302 --> 03:27:29.436
APPROPRIATE RATE OF

03:27:31.071 --> 03:27:32.006
WHILE KEEPING THOSE CONSUMERS

03:27:32.072 --> 03:27:33.374
OUT OF THE MIDDLE AND

03:27:33.440 --> 03:27:34.842
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO SEE THIS

03:27:34.909 --> 03:27:36.443
BILL TODAY AS A WAY THAT SORT OF

03:27:36.510 --> 03:27:37.878
PUSHES THAT PENDULUM AND THE

03:27:37.945 --> 03:27:39.580
OTHER WAY TOWARDS THE PROVIDER

03:27:39.647 --> 03:27:40.381
GROUP.

03:27:40.447 --> 03:27:42.049
AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT ON

03:27:42.116 --> 03:27:44.585
THE CD I SIDE WE DO HAVE ROBUST

03:27:44.652 --> 03:27:45.753
NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS

03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:47.988
WOULD DO MAKE US FILE EVERY TIME

03:27:48.055 --> 03:27:49.323
THERE IS A IF THERE IS A

03:27:49.390 --> 03:27:50.391
POTENTIAL TERMINATION OF A

03:27:50.457 --> 03:27:52.593
CONTRACT TEN DAYS PRIOR.

03:27:52.660 --> 03:27:53.994
TO WE HAVE TO DO A SPECIFIC

03:27:54.061 --> 03:27:56.330
REPORT TO CDI ABOUT ANY MATERIAL

03:27:56.397 --> 03:27:58.232
MODIFICATION BASED ON HOSPITAL

03:27:58.299 --> 03:27:59.700
BASED POSITION SPECIFICALLY

03:27:59.767 --> 03:28:00.968
ANESTHESIOLOGIST.

03:28:01.035 --> 03:28:03.137
AND ANY CORRECTIVE PLAN RELATED

03:28:03.204 --> 03:28:04.438
TO ANY TERMINATIONS ARE NETWORK

03:28:04.505 --> 03:28:07.107
CONCERNS SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT

03:28:07.174 --> 03:28:08.843
WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:28:08.909 --> 03:28:10.277
REIMBURSEMENT RATE THERE'S AN

03:28:10.344 --> 03:28:11.912
INDEPENDENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION

03:28:11.979 --> 03:28:13.347
PROCESS THAT CAN BE SEEK.

03:28:13.414 --> 03:28:14.815
TO BY THE PROVIDER IF THEY

03:28:14.882 --> 03:28:16.183
BELIEVE THAT THE PLAN IS NOT

03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:18.018
FAIRLY REIMBURSING THEM WE THINK

03:28:18.085 --> 03:28:19.653
THAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A

03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:20.654
GREAT.

03:28:20.721 --> 03:28:22.122
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO SHOW

03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:23.624
WHEN THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT

03:28:23.691 --> 03:28:25.259
NETWORK ADEQUACY WE REALLY THINK

03:28:25.326 --> 03:28:26.894
THAT THAT IS THE BETTER VENUE.

03:28:26.961 --> 03:28:29.129
FOR THIS KIND OF DISPUTE BETWEEN

03:28:29.196 --> 03:28:31.098
TWO LARGER PARTIES TO BE TAKEN

03:28:31.165 --> 03:28:32.499
TO THE REGULATOR IF THERE IS A

03:28:32.566 --> 03:28:33.801
CONCERN ABOUT THE ADEQUATE

03:28:33.868 --> 03:28:34.635
NETWORK.

03:28:34.702 --> 03:28:35.703
THE NOT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH

03:28:35.769 --> 03:28:37.238
THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND NOT

03:28:37.304 --> 03:28:38.439
NECESSARILY THROUGH THE

03:28:38.505 --> 03:28:39.773
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:41.075
WE'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR

03:28:41.141 --> 03:28:42.376
HOSPITAL BASED POSITIONS

03:28:42.443 --> 03:28:44.545
OFTENTIMES THE INSURER HAS NO

03:28:44.612 --> 03:28:45.846
CONTROLLER WHOSE ACTUALLY

03:28:45.913 --> 03:28:47.414
ASSIGNED THE DAY I HAVE A

03:28:47.481 --> 03:28:48.282
PROCEDURE.

03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:49.550
THAT SOLELY BASED WITH THE

03:28:49.617 --> 03:28:50.951
HOSPITAL AND SO OFTEN TIMES YOU

03:28:51.018 --> 03:28:53.354
COULD HAVE AND A VERY WIDE

03:28:53.420 --> 03:28:57.725
BREADTH OF THE NETWORK BUT YOU

03:28:57.791 --> 03:28:58.325
COULD HAVE SOMEONE SHOW UP ONE

03:28:58.392 --> 03:28:59.460
DAY HEY AND THE HOSPITAL ASSIGN

03:28:59.526 --> 03:29:00.060
SOMEONE WHO HAPPENS TO NOT BE

03:29:00.127 --> 03:29:01.695
THE SAME AS THAT INSURED POLICY.

03:29:01.762 --> 03:29:03.163
AND THEREFORE YOU END UP WITH

03:29:03.230 --> 03:29:04.131
SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE EVERYTHING

03:29:04.198 --> 03:29:05.599
RIGHT THEY'VE GONE TO AN IN

03:29:05.666 --> 03:29:06.767
NETWORK FACILITY HAD AN IN

03:29:06.834 --> 03:29:08.002

THAT DAY.

03:29:13.440 --> 03:29:14.975
THAT PERSON HAPPENS TO BE OUT OF

03:29:15.042 --> 03:29:15.643
NETWORK THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

03:29:15.709 --> 03:29:17.144
THE NETWORK ISN'T ADEQUATE IT

03:29:17.211 --> 03:29:19.013
JUST MEANS THAT WE WE DON'T

03:29:19.079 --> 03:29:20.447
NECESSARILY HAVE CONTROL BECAUSE

03:29:20.514 --> 03:29:21.815
HOSPITALS CAN'T EMPLOYEE

03:29:21.882 --> 03:29:23.384

ASSIGNED THE DATE OF TO A

03:29:24.919 --> 03:29:26.954
PATIENT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE

03:29:27.021 --> 03:29:28.555
REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE DO

03:29:28.622 --> 03:29:30.057

03:29:48.342 --> 03:29:50.477
125% OF MEDICARE IT'S UNDER 25%

03:29:50.544 --> 03:29:51.378

CONTRACTED RATE WHICHEVER IS

03:29:52.746 --> 03:29:54.181
HIGHER SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

03:29:54.248 --> 03:29:57.151

THAT THE BILL REQUIRES HEALTH

03:30:10.064 --> 03:30:10.864
PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH

03:30:10.931 --> 03:30:12.599
ANESTHESIOLOGY JUST REGARDLESS

03:30:12.666 --> 03:30:13.934
OF THE COST.

03:30:14.001 --> 03:30:15.602
SO -- AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO TRY

03:30:15.669 --> 03:30:16.937
TO REDUCE OUR COSTS FOR HEALTH

03:30:17.004 --> 03:30:18.238
CARE SYSTEM OVERALL BECAUSE ME A

03:30:18.305 --> 03:30:23.110
LITTLE BIT OF A SO -- I AGREE

03:30:23.177 --> 03:30:24.545
THAT IT IS WRONG FOR PLANS TO

UNFAIRLY AN INAPPROPRIATELY

03:30:25.746 --> 03:30:27.715
TERMINATE EXISTING CONTRACTS BUT

03:30:27.781 --> 03:30:29.850
I HESITATE TO SWING THE PENDULUM

03:30:29.917 --> 03:30:30.551
TOO FAR.

03:30:30.617 --> 03:30:31.885

TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE IS IS AN

03:30:43.097 --> 03:30:45.332
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- I

03:30:45.399 --> 03:30:47.001
THINK THAT -- I NEVER I NEVER

03:30:47.067 --> 03:30:49.236
ENVISIONED -- I WORKED CLOSELY

03:30:49.303 --> 03:30:50.637
WITH MR BONTA ON THIS BILL FOR

WELL OVER A YEAR AB SEVENTY TWO

03:30:52.573 --> 03:30:54.108
WE NEVER ENVISIONED.

03:30:54.174 --> 03:30:56.110
THAT -- AT THE EXISTING

03:30:56.176 --> 03:30:59.580
CONTRACTS WOULD THEN BE SLASHED

03:30:59.646 --> 03:31:01.015
TO TO MUCH MUCH LOWER LEVELS WE

03:31:01.081 --> 03:31:03.784
ANTICIPATED -- FUTURE CONTRACTS

03:31:03.851 --> 03:31:05.886
NOT RISING AS FAST TO TO TO

03:31:05.953 --> 03:31:07.755
CURTAIL THE RISING COSTS WE

03:31:07.821 --> 03:31:10.057
DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT THAT SOME

03:31:10.124 --> 03:31:11.492
PLANTS NOT ALL BUT SOME PLANS

03:31:11.558 --> 03:31:13.827
WOULD USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY.

03:31:13.894 --> 03:31:15.763
TO TO SLASH REIMBURSEMENT ON ON

03:31:15.829 --> 03:31:18.132
IN MANY CASES -- CONTRACTS HAVE

03:31:18.198 --> 03:31:19.933
BEEN IN PLACE FOR EVERGREEN

03:31:20.000 --> 03:31:21.502
CONTACTS FOR DECADES.

03:31:21.568 --> 03:31:24.471
SO -- SO I AM TRUST ME I AM AS

03:31:26.006 --> 03:31:28.375
HEALTHCARE COSTS AND AND AND AND

03:31:28.442 --> 03:31:30.244
PROVIDER NETWORKS AND SO I'M

MORE THAN HAPPY CONTINUE WORKING

03:31:31.578 --> 03:31:33.714
WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON

03:31:33.781 --> 03:31:35.049
THIS I RECOGNIZE THIS DIFFICULT.

03:31:35.115 --> 03:31:36.083
IT'S A CLOCK IN THE PENDULUM

03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:37.251
SWINGING BACK AND FORTH

03:31:37.317 --> 03:31:38.886
EVENTUALLY WE'RE GOING TO GET IT

03:31:38.952 --> 03:31:40.954
TO STOP IN THE RIGHT PLACE --

03:31:41.021 --> 03:31:45.292
AND I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSER

03:31:45.359 --> 03:31:46.827
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

03:31:46.894 --> 03:31:49.897
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS.

03:31:49.963 --> 03:31:50.564
CITAT.

03:31:50.631 --> 03:31:52.433
DOCTOR WOULD JUST LOOKING AT THE

03:31:52.499 --> 03:31:53.901
ANALYSIS I'M HERE BUT THIS IS

03:31:53.967 --> 03:31:55.402
FROM HEALTH ACCESS -- IT SAYS

03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:57.638
THAT -- AB ELEVEN SEVENTY FOUR

03:31:57.704 --> 03:31:58.472
DRIES UP HEALTH CARE COSTS BY

03:31:58.539 --> 03:32:00.507
REQUIRING HEALTH PLANS A

03:32:00.574 --> 03:32:02.276
AT ANY COST A RECENT NATIONAL

03:32:02.342 --> 03:32:03.544
DATA SHOWS THAT SOME

03:32:03.610 --> 03:32:04.511
ANESTHESIOLOGIST CHARGE MORE

03:32:04.578 --> 03:32:05.345
THAN NINE AND A PERCENT OF

03:32:05.412 --> 03:32:07.714
MEDICARE AND THE AVERAGE CHARGES

03:32:07.781 --> 03:32:08.916
510050% OF MEDICARE.

03:32:08.982 --> 03:32:09.917
THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW

03:32:09.983 --> 03:32:11.418
ANESTHESIOLOGIST TO DEMAND TO BE

03:32:11.485 --> 03:32:12.953
PAID A RATE IN EXCESS OF MATTER

03:32:13.020 --> 03:32:15.089
PERCENT OF MEDICARE.

03:32:15.155 --> 03:32:17.057
AND SO JUST WANT TO MAP WHEN

03:32:17.124 --> 03:32:17.691
PEOPLE WRITE STUFF ALL THE TIME

03:32:17.758 --> 03:32:19.860
BUT THE CONCERN I HAVE IS

03:32:19.927 --> 03:32:21.195
ACTUALLY THE SAME IS -- MISS

03:32:21.261 --> 03:32:23.931
AGUIAR-CURRY.

03:32:23.997 --> 03:32:26.033
IN THAT.

03:32:26.100 --> 03:32:26.800
IN HEALTH CARE.

03:32:26.867 --> 03:32:27.401
IT IS NOT A COMPETITIVE IT IS

03:32:27.468 --> 03:32:28.502
NOT A FREE MARKET SYSTEM WHERE

03:32:28.569 --> 03:32:29.837
YOU HAVE A WILLING BUYER AND A

03:32:29.903 --> 03:32:31.138
WILLING SO SELLER.

03:32:31.205 --> 03:32:32.706
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ROLE OF

03:32:32.773 --> 03:32:34.608
PRICES THAT TO DECIDE WHAT'S

03:32:34.675 --> 03:32:36.343
WHAT'S THERE THERE ARE THIRD

03:32:36.410 --> 03:32:37.344
PARTY.

03:32:37.411 --> 03:32:40.247
PAYERS AND YOU'VE GOT A PROVIDER

03:32:40.314 --> 03:32:41.148
THAT IS DEMANDING A CERTAIN

03:32:41.215 --> 03:32:42.116
LEVEL.

03:32:42.182 --> 03:32:43.550
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BAD HOW

03:32:43.617 --> 03:32:46.820
DO YOU MAKE SURE -- THAT -- ON

03:32:46.887 --> 03:32:48.589
BOTH SIDES OF THAT EQUATION THAT

03:32:48.655 --> 03:32:50.491
WERE NOT GET THE YOU KNOW WE'RE

03:32:50.557 --> 03:32:51.758
WE'RE NOT INCREASING COSTS OF

03:32:51.825 --> 03:32:53.260
WHAT IN THIS BILL ACTUALLY

03:32:53.327 --> 03:32:54.261
ADDRESSES THAT.

03:32:54.328 --> 03:32:55.496
WHAT'S IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND

03:32:55.562 --> 03:32:56.830
I THINK I THINK WE'RE STILL

03:32:56.897 --> 03:32:58.098
WE'RE STILL HAVING SOME OF THOSE

03:32:58.165 --> 03:32:59.900
DISCUSSIONS BUT AS I SAID

03:32:59.967 --> 03:33:05.672
EARLIER THE INTENTION WAS NOT.

03:33:05.739 --> 03:33:06.473
FOR PLAN TO SAY OKAY WE'RE WE'RE

03:33:06.540 --> 03:33:08.208
GONNA DRIVE YOUR CONTRACT DOWN

03:33:08.275 --> 03:33:09.309
45%.

03:33:09.376 --> 03:33:10.711
AND THAT HAPPENED IN ONE CASE I

03:33:10.777 --> 03:33:16.283
BELIEVE 45% YOU ANYMORE --

03:33:16.350 --> 03:33:18.986
BECAUSE OF WOLF WILL FIND

03:33:19.052 --> 03:33:20.821
ANOTHER WAY TO DO IT -- AND I

03:33:20.888 --> 03:33:22.122
COULD YOU KNOW DOCTOR POPE MIGHT

03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:23.524
BE ABLE TO OR OR MISTER DOCTOR

03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:24.591
MIGHT BE ABLE TO TO ELABORATE ON

03:33:24.658 --> 03:33:25.359
THAT.

03:33:25.425 --> 03:33:27.528
BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT

03:33:27.594 --> 03:33:29.630
THEY'RE THERE LOOK MY INTENTION

03:33:29.696 --> 03:33:31.064
IS NOT TO DRIVE THE COST CARE A

03:33:31.131 --> 03:33:32.666
MY INTENTION WAS TO FLATTEN THE

03:33:32.733 --> 03:33:34.401
COURAGE AND KEEP IT TO A LOWER.

03:33:34.468 --> 03:33:36.370
BUT BUT I NEVER INTENDED BUT WE

03:33:36.436 --> 03:33:38.405
NEVER I WAS NOT MY INTENT TO

03:33:38.472 --> 03:33:39.806
DRIVE THE COST DOWN TO DRIVE

03:33:39.873 --> 03:33:41.508
THESE EXISTING CONTRACTS DOWN

03:33:41.575 --> 03:33:42.876
AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAS

03:33:42.943 --> 03:33:44.411
HAPPENED IN SOME OF THESE CASES --

03:33:44.478 --> 03:33:46.513
WHICH IS MADE DIFFICULT FOR SOME

03:33:46.580 --> 03:33:48.282
PROVIDERS SO I GUESS MAYBE I

03:33:48.348 --> 03:33:48.916
MAKE IN YOU AND I'VE WE'VE HAD

03:33:48.982 --> 03:33:50.617
LOTS OF THESE CONVERSATION WE

03:33:50.684 --> 03:33:53.487
HAVE A LOT OF AND SO WHAT ABOUT

03:33:53.554 --> 03:33:55.489
THIS BILL -- THE PROVIDES THAT

03:33:55.556 --> 03:33:57.257
THAT THAT BALANCE MAYBE YOU CAN --

03:33:57.324 --> 03:33:59.359
YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT YET I THANK

03:33:59.426 --> 03:34:00.227
YOU MISTER MAYES PRESTAR GRAHAM

03:34:00.294 --> 03:34:02.062
ON BEHALF OF CSA I THINK IT'S

03:34:02.129 --> 03:34:03.297
IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT.

03:34:03.363 --> 03:34:05.132
AB SEVENTY TWO THE INTENT WAS

03:34:05.199 --> 03:34:06.266
TWO FOLD ONE WAS TO TAKE THE

03:34:06.333 --> 03:34:07.034
PATIENT ON A MIDDLE THESE

03:34:07.100 --> 03:34:13.707
CONTRACT DISPUTES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:34:13.774 --> 03:34:14.508
GOING ON FOR WAY TOO LONG.

03:34:14.575 --> 03:34:15.475
THE SECOND PURPOSE OF AB SEVENTY

03:34:15.542 --> 03:34:16.343
TWO BY SETTING UP AN INTERIM

03:34:16.410 --> 03:34:17.010
PAYMENT RATE WHICH OPPOSITION IS

03:34:17.077 --> 03:34:17.945
CORRECT IT THE INTERIM PAYMENT

03:34:18.011 --> 03:34:19.546
RATE IF YOU CAN'T IF YOU HAVE TO

03:34:19.613 --> 03:34:20.881
GO OUT OF NETWORK.

110025% OF MEDICARE OR THE

03:34:28.021 --> 03:34:29.590
AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE GIVEN

03:34:29.656 --> 03:34:31.758
THE THE FORMULA THAT WE HAVE FOR

03:34:31.825 --> 03:34:33.627
MEDI CAL FOR ANASTASIA SERVICES.

03:34:33.694 --> 03:34:35.596
UNDER 25% IS NEVER GOING TO WORK

03:34:35.662 --> 03:34:37.264
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE PARLAYED TO

03:34:37.331 --> 03:34:38.865
THE AVERAGE CONTRACTED RATE AND

03:34:38.932 --> 03:34:40.767
AND MISTER BONTA WE'RE GLAD THAT

03:34:40.834 --> 03:34:42.302
THOSE PROVISIONS WERE INCLUDED.

03:34:42.369 --> 03:34:44.404
THE INTENT OF AB SEVENTY TWO WAS

03:34:44.471 --> 03:34:45.639
NEVER.

03:34:45.706 --> 03:34:47.040
TO DRIVE DOWN HEALTHCARE COSTS

03:34:47.107 --> 03:34:49.643
PER SE ALL THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES

03:34:49.710 --> 03:34:52.112
WE'RE NOT WE'RE WE INTENTIONALLY.

03:34:52.179 --> 03:34:54.381
WENT AWAY FROM ANYTHING RELATED

03:34:54.448 --> 03:34:55.749
TO RATES AND CONTRACTS AND

03:34:55.816 --> 03:34:58.151
PERCENTAGES OF THIS ALL THIS

03:34:58.218 --> 03:34:59.419
BILL BASICALLY SAYS.

03:34:59.486 --> 03:35:01.221
IS THAT IF YOU'RE A HEALTH PLAN

03:35:01.288 --> 03:35:02.923
ENSURE THEIR DELEGATED ENTITY

03:35:02.990 --> 03:35:06.059
AND THERE IS A PLAN OR DELEGATED

03:35:06.126 --> 03:35:07.761
ENTITY AND NISHIDA TERMINATION

03:35:07.828 --> 03:35:09.062
OF THE CONTRACT.

03:35:09.129 --> 03:35:10.497
YOU JUST HAVE TO PROVE TO YOUR

03:35:10.564 --> 03:35:12.466
REGULATOR THAT YOU HAVE AN

03:35:12.532 --> 03:35:14.067
ADEQUATE NETWORK OF ANASTASIA

03:35:14.134 --> 03:35:16.203
SERVICES AT THAT CONTRACTED

03:35:16.270 --> 03:35:17.004
FACILITY.

03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:20.841
SO THIS DOES NOTHING TO FORCE A

03:35:20.907 --> 03:35:22.042
HEALTH PLAN TO CONTRACT WITH THE

03:35:22.109 --> 03:35:23.644
NAME IS DJ GROUP ALL IT

03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:25.445
BASICALLY DOES IS TO SAY.

03:35:25.512 --> 03:35:27.314
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES IN

03:35:27.381 --> 03:35:29.583
THIS IN THE STATE WHERE THERE

03:35:29.650 --> 03:35:31.151
HAVE BEEN NO WAY AS DCL JUST ON

03:35:31.218 --> 03:35:31.718
STAFF.

03:35:31.785 --> 03:35:32.686
THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED

03:35:32.753 --> 03:35:34.755
HEALTHCARE HAS QUESTION AND OPEN

03:35:34.821 --> 03:35:37.324
UP ALLEGATIONS IN A CASE AGAINST --

03:35:37.391 --> 03:35:39.092
ANTHEM BLUE CROSS IN THE

03:35:39.159 --> 03:35:40.327
COUNTIES OF SAN DIEGO ORANGE

03:35:40.394 --> 03:35:41.962
SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES BECAUSE

03:35:42.029 --> 03:35:43.230
THERE WERE NO ANESTHESIA

03:35:43.297 --> 03:35:45.232
ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS ON STAFF

03:35:45.299 --> 03:35:45.799
BECAUSE THE TERMINATION OF

03:35:45.866 --> 03:35:47.834
CONTRACTS SO WE INTENTIONALLY

03:35:47.901 --> 03:35:49.436
AVOIDING THAT THE COST.

03:35:49.503 --> 03:35:51.405
AND AND OUT OF THE MONETARY

03:35:51.471 --> 03:35:52.906
POINTS ALL WE'RE SAYING IS YOU

03:35:52.973 --> 03:35:53.540
JUST HAVE TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE

03:35:53.607 --> 03:35:55.309
NUMBER OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS

03:35:55.375 --> 03:35:56.343
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:57.678
PROCEDURES THAT GET DONE.

03:35:57.744 --> 03:35:59.313
IN A HOSPITAL DOCTOR POKING TALK

03:35:59.379 --> 03:36:01.315
TO THAT BETTER THAN I THAT

03:36:01.381 --> 03:36:02.983
REQUIRE HERE IN SD JUST SERVICES

03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:04.184
IS KIND OF AN IMPORTANT PART OF

03:36:04.251 --> 03:36:10.557
A HOW DO YOU GUARD AGAINST

03:36:10.624 --> 03:36:11.525
MANIPULATION.

03:36:11.591 --> 03:36:13.226
I'M SORRY HOW DO YOU GUARD

03:36:13.293 --> 03:36:14.795
AGAINST MANIPULATION WITH THAT.

03:36:14.861 --> 03:36:16.229
HOUSING THE REASON I BRING THIS

03:36:16.296 --> 03:36:17.030
UP IS THERE'S ANOTHER INSTANCE

03:36:17.097 --> 03:36:18.265
WHICH I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

03:36:18.332 --> 03:36:19.366
REGARDS TO ANOTHER -- ANOTHER

03:36:19.433 --> 03:36:20.434
ANOTHER TYPE OF PROVIDERS WHERE

03:36:20.500 --> 03:36:21.401
THIS THE QUESTION HAD COME UP IN

03:36:21.468 --> 03:36:22.002
PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE'S

03:36:22.069 --> 03:36:23.804
BEEN MANIPULATION IS BECAUSE IT

03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:25.906
REQUIRES THIS NUMBER OF PEOPLE

03:36:25.972 --> 03:36:27.240
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PARTICULAR

03:36:27.307 --> 03:36:28.108
WORK AND SO.

03:36:28.175 --> 03:36:29.543
THIS DID DID THESE PROVIDERS

03:36:29.609 --> 03:36:31.678
HAVE GAME THE SYSTEM AND SO HOW

03:36:31.745 --> 03:36:33.547
DO YOU WITH WITH THIS BILL AND

03:36:33.613 --> 03:36:35.048
HOW DO YOU AND YOU GUARD GETS

03:36:35.115 --> 03:36:36.283
MANIPULATION BECAUSE IT WILL

03:36:36.350 --> 03:36:37.818
HAPPEN I MEAN HUMAN NATURE TELLS

03:36:37.884 --> 03:36:38.485
US THAT.

03:36:38.552 --> 03:36:39.486
YEAH YOU YOU MANAGER TELLS US

03:36:39.553 --> 03:36:40.987
WE'RE GONNA ACT OUR OWN BEST

03:36:41.054 --> 03:36:42.589
INTEREST RIGHT SO I THINK I

03:36:42.656 --> 03:36:43.690
THINK I COULDN'T SAY IT ANY

03:36:43.757 --> 03:36:45.025
BETTER THAN DOCTOR WOULD WHICH

03:36:45.092 --> 03:36:46.026
IS WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A

03:36:46.093 --> 03:36:48.195
BALANCE AND THIS ISSUE ABOUT A

03:36:48.261 --> 03:36:49.329
NETWORK SERVICES AND SURPRISE

03:36:49.396 --> 03:36:50.964
BILLS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN.

03:36:51.031 --> 03:36:51.565
THIS BUILDING FOR FORTY PLUS

03:36:51.631 --> 03:36:54.434
YEARS AND WHEN WE WHEN WE DID AB

03:36:54.501 --> 03:36:55.669
SEVENTY TWO WE REALIZED THAT WAS

03:36:55.736 --> 03:36:57.170
A SOLUTION FOR A SNAPSHOT IN

03:36:57.237 --> 03:36:58.004
TIME.

03:36:58.071 --> 03:36:59.973
OKAY IT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT THAN

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:01.074
WHEN WE STARTED INDEPENDENT

03:37:01.141 --> 03:37:02.542
MEDICAL REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT

03:37:02.609 --> 03:37:03.577
MANAGED HEALTHCARE.

03:37:03.643 --> 03:37:05.011
THERE'S THERE IS AN EQUILIBRIUM

03:37:05.078 --> 03:37:07.047
OVER TIME THE KIND OF HAPPENS

03:37:07.114 --> 03:37:08.882
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS --

03:37:08.949 --> 03:37:12.152
SITUATIONS WHERE PATIENTS IN AND

03:37:12.219 --> 03:37:13.520
CONTRACTED FACILITIES.

03:37:13.587 --> 03:37:15.389
DO NOT AND POTENTIALLY WILL NOT

03:37:15.455 --> 03:37:16.623
HAVE ACCESS TO ANASTASIA

03:37:16.690 --> 03:37:18.925
SERVICES SO IT IS KIND OF A

03:37:18.992 --> 03:37:20.060
BALANCING ACT THE PENDULUM

03:37:20.127 --> 03:37:21.795
SWINGS BOTH WAYS BUT IN THESE
