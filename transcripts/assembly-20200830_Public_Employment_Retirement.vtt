00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.326
MADE MY POINT- WHAT HE REALLY

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:36.194
ARTICULATED WAS THAT THEY DON'T

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:37.963
DESIRE TO OFFER A PENSION PLAN.

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:39.698
AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING HERE TO

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:40.832
DO IS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:43.168
