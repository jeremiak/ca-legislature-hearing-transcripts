MILLION UIGHURS IS A STAIN ON

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.546
THE WHOLE OF HUMANITY THAT WE

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.548

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:07.229
LIVING THROUGH MANIFESTS. THIS

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:08.464
IS NOT TO SAY THAT OUR STATE

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.066

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:22.011
BE MERCILESS TO THOSE WE HATE.

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:22.878
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAPIDLY

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:25.014
BUILD A BETTER WORLD. BUT CAN

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:27.283
DESTROY IT IN SECONDS. MOST

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.484

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:50.065
THROUGH HISTORY. WE KNOW THAT

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.934
WHEN WE UNRAVEL THINGS AFTER

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.902
YEARS OF HAPPENING. IT'S

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:56.805
ALREADY TOO LATE. AND POLITICS

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:59.074
WHEN POLITICS GETS INVOLVED AND

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:01.677
MAKES A FORCEFUL DECISION. IT'S

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:04.913
ALREADY WAY TOO LATE. SO IF

THERE'S ANY HOPE OF MAKING A

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.584
DIFFERENCE NOW IS THE TIME FOR

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.652

AND SYSTEMICALLY BEING

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:25.334
CONDUCTED. THE REST OF THE

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.702
