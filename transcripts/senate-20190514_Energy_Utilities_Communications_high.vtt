00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.512
WOULD SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMS TO

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:54.080
MAKE SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T --

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.915
EXCEED WHAT WAS AUTHORIZED OSA

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.518
ADVOCATED THAT THAT NOT BE A

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.486
CONSTRAINT THAT THAT THE UTILITY

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.088
MUST GO AND AND INVEST IN

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.556
WHATEVER IS NEEDED IN THE SAFETY

00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:04.991
PROGRAMS BUT NOT UC

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.859
AUTHORIZATION HAS A LIMIT TO IN

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.928
TERMS OF THEIR SAFETY.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:15.701
INVESTMENTS ON AND THEN --

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:17.236
FINALLY ON THE VERY LAST PAGE ON

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:17.837
PAGE THIRTY WE WE WE KIND OF

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:18.671
HIGHLIGHTING CATEGORIZE OUR ROAD

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:19.972
MAP IN TERMS OF THE ELEMENTS

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:22.742
THAT SB -- SIXTY TWO MANDATES.

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.343
FOR US IN WHICH THE ROADMAP

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.779
INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE ON PAGE

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:28.014
THIRTY AT THE VERY END YOU KNOW

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.349
THE OUR OUR WORK IN TERMS OF THE

00:07:30.416 --> 00:07:31.784
PROCEEDINGS ARE WORK.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:33.519
I UTILITY SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:35.755
CULTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:38.491
THEN OUR WORK IN TERMS OF CPU

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.459
SEE SAFETY MANAGEMENT.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.929
AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE

00:07:42.995 --> 00:07:44.363
OF THINGS FROM THAT.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.765
SAFETY ON BOND THAT WE HAD ON

00:07:45.832 --> 00:07:47.767
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO WHEN

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.837
WE READ THAT IN THE IN THE CODE

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:51.771
IN IN THE STATUTE.

00:07:51.838 --> 00:07:53.239
WITH A FOCUS ON SAFETY

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:54.974
MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE WE

00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.642
LOOK AT THAT AS WHAT BETTER

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:57.877
PLACE TO GO THEN TO LOOK AT

00:07:57.944 --> 00:07:59.212
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.646
STANDARD.

00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:02.315
AND THEN LOOK AND SEE HOW THOSE

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.416
COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:04.951
CALIFORNIA ENERGY UTILITIES

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.385
ALREADY SEVERAL INDUSTRIES

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:07.920
REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTING SAFETY

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.223
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND STANDARDS

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:11.791
TO IMPROVE SAFETY F. A. A. JUST

00:08:11.858 --> 00:08:12.825
MADE THEM A REQUIREMENT I

00:08:12.892 --> 00:08:15.595
BELIEVE THE LAST YEAR.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:16.796
AB I HAS THE STANDARDS.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.231
NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD ACTUALLY

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.532
HAS STANDARD FOR SAFETY

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.300
MANAGEMENT WHICH THE REGULATOR

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.202
ARTISTS TO THEM FTA HAS COME OUT

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.136
WITH THEM.

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:24.971
THERE'S A CALIFORNIA IN

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:29.475
ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.177
PROGRAM MARITIME.

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:31.777
AND THERE'S THE INTERNATIONAL

ASSURANCE.

00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.528
INVESTIGATED CAUSE I'M GOING TO

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:50.930
ALL OF THEM.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:52.832
I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- A

COUNTY WHO GAVE A PRESENTATION

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:58.971
THAT TALKED ABOUT THEIR

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.473
IMPROVEMENT IN REDUCTION IN

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:01.574
INCIDENT RATES AFTER THEY

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.242
IMPLEMENTED SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:04.577
SYSTEM IN SAFETY CULTURE.

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.078
REQUIREMENTS IN CONTRA COSTA

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.347
COUNTY IT'S PRETTY COMPELLING.

00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:10.449
IT WAS VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THAT

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:11.851
PRESENTATION BROUGHT FORWARD

00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:14.654
ALSO WE HAD A A REGULATOR FROM

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.055
NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD WHO ALSO

00:09:16.122 --> 00:09:18.658
IS A SAFETY CULTURE EXPERT.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:21.027
WHO -- WHO DID A DISSERTATION ON

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:22.828
THE IMPACT OF SAFETY CULTURE ON

UTILITIES AT THE REGULATOR

00:09:31.904 --> 00:09:36.575
REGULATES SO THESE ARE VERY.

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.844
CORE ISSUES WE BELIEVE IN INTO

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.646

AWARE WE WE HAVE SO WE HAVE

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.590
DRAFTED A SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:52.825
SYSTEM STANDARD.

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:54.293
WHICH WE ARE WE WHICH WE ARE

IT TOWARDS FOR THE COMMISSION TO

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.398
BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT AS A

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:01.334
REQUIREMENT.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.171
FOR UTILITIES I'M ALSO -- AS

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:07.173
PART OF THAT WE HAVE PHASES IN

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.541
THAT IN IN THAT PROPOSED

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.443
PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMISSION ONE

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:12.878
ALSO INCLUDES A SAFETY REPORTING

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:13.479
SYSTEM.

00:10:13.546 --> 00:10:15.414
I'M AND ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT CAN

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.183
BE DONE IN TERMS OF SAFETY

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:18.551
CULTURE WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.119
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.288
CONTRA COSTA WHERE THEY ACTUALLY

00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:22.788
HAVE THE SAFETY CULTURE

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:23.356
REQUIREMENTS.

00:10:23.422 --> 00:10:27.293
I'M IN SO WE HOPE TO HAVE THAT.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.127
BEFORE AN AGENDA ON THE

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:30.062
COMMISSION IN THE NEAR TERM.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.431
AND ACTUALLY IN JUNE OF NEXT

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:34.166
MONTH WE HAVE BROUGHT IN A A

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:35.301
TRAINER.

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.070
WHO IS GOING TO DO SAFETY

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:40.272
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TRAIN?

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.174
THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:44.677
VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH ALL OF OUR

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:45.911
SITES AND INVITE.

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:46.712
FOLKS FROM ALL OVER THE

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:47.947
COMMISSION TO OBTAIN IT'S NOT

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:49.915
ABOUT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.852
OR THE REGULATOR BUT IT IS ABOUT

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:54.787
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:56.088
HOW THOSE ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.190
UTILITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.860
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL STAFF TO

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:02.328
KIND OF GET EXPOSURE TO THIS?

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:04.330
AND ALSO FOR OWN BENEFIT TO

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:07.199
LEARN FROM THIS -- TRAINING

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:08.968
OURSELVES.

00:11:09.035 --> 00:11:11.003
FROM FROM EXPERTISE THAT'S OUT

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.271
THERE.

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:13.606
AND TO SOCIALIZE IT SO THAT MORE

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:14.707
FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT A

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:16.342
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND A

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:17.243
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:20.346
STANDARD IS AND HOW THEY'RE USED

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:21.313
AND WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.748
THAT.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.084
SO I WANTED -- TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.086
AND THEN ALSO -- WE ALSO MAKE

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.355
USE OF THE SAFETY FLAG SYSTEM

00:11:29.422 --> 00:11:31.023
THAT THE COMMISSION HAS.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.391
SOMETIMES A PROCEEDINGS HAVE

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.427
HAVE VERY RIGID TIME LINES AND

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:36.429
SO WHEN WE GOT STARTED THERE WAS

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:37.797
A UTILITY PROCEEDING GOING ON IN

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.198
WHICH WE THE TRAIN HAD LEFT THE

00:11:39.265 --> 00:11:40.266
STATION.

00:11:40.332 --> 00:11:42.301
BUT WE HAD SOME CONCERNS IN THAT

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.702
SAFETY.

00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:47.940
IN THAT IN THAT UTILITIES.

00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:49.875
RISK SOME OF ITS REST IN THAT

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.178
AND SO WHAT WE DID IS.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.813
WHAT WE DID IS WE SUBMITTED A

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:54.647
SAFETY FLAG IT WAS JUST NOT

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.949
FEASIBLE FOR US TO GET INVOLVED

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:57.583
IN THE PRECEDING THAT THAT TIME

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.417
AND?

00:11:58.484 --> 00:11:59.919
OF THE PRECEDING IN TERMS OF HOW

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:01.720
IT WAS UNFOLDING SO WE SUBMITTED

00:12:01.787 --> 00:12:03.823
A SAFETY FLAG SO THAT IT COULD

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.191
BE FOLLOWED UP AND THEN.

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.659
IT ACTUALLY HAD TO DO WITH

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:07.827
CONCERNS WE HAD ABOUT.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.695
A HIGH RISK WHICH WOULD BE LIKE

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:12.164
A LARGE OIL FIELD TRANSFORMER

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.532
THAT IS IN HIGH RISE BUILDINGS

00:12:13.599 --> 00:12:16.202
I'M NOT SO ANYWAY JUST WANTED.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:19.238
TO GIVE YOU THAT JUST KINDA LIKE

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.740
HIGHLIGHTS.

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.643
AND THEN -- AND THEN ASKED --

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.545
INTENT ASK A RESPOND TO YOUR

00:12:26.612 --> 00:12:29.215
QUESTIONS OR IF ANYTHING AYE AYE

00:12:29.281 --> 00:12:31.784
SAID PROMPTED ANYTHING I YEAH

00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:34.053
YOU KNOW ACTUALLY IT IT DID A

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.689
COUPLE OF THINGS AND AND NO BARS.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:39.792
TAKING NOTES HERE AS WELL THE OF

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:40.526
WE TALK ABOUT THE AND I DO HAVE

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:41.694
SOME.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.129
REGULAR QUESTIONS THAT I CAN PUT

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.563
TOGETHER BUT THE A SAFETY

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.565
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS HOW HOW IS

00:12:46.632 --> 00:12:49.268
THE HOW IS HAVE HAS BEEN

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:50.169
RECEIVED.

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.004
IN TERMS OF YOUR APPROACH TO TRY

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.372
AND GET THE UTILITIES LOOK AT

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:54.406
THAT AND THEN WE ALSO LOOK AT

00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:57.209
HOW THE REGULATOR WOULD BE.

00:12:57.276 --> 00:12:58.544
INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS AT SOME

00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:00.112
POINT.

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.780
SO WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IN

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.215
SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS AS WELL

00:13:03.282 --> 00:13:05.484
WE'RE WE TOUCH UPON SAFETY

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:06.886
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:10.356
IMPLEMENTATION AT A UTILITY I'M

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:11.790
ONE THING THAT WE LEARNED AT THE

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:14.593
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOND

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:14.894
[inaudible]

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.030
FROM -- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IS

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.799
THAT A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:22.501
IT'S NOT JUST HAVING A SAFETY

00:13:22.568 --> 00:13:23.969
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT'S HOW YOU

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:25.304
IMPLEMENTED SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.272
SYSTEM.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:27.706
THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY POINTS

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:29.175
AND ACTUALLY SAFETY CULTURE WITH

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:30.910
AN OPERATOR CAN HAVE A BIG

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:34.346
IMPACT ON THAT IN FACT JUST

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:35.748
RECENTLY TALKING WITH THIS.

00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:36.549
WE STAY IN TOUCH WITH MOST OF

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.551
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THAT

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.219
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOB.

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.921
WE BELIEVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:43.489
TO STAY ENGAGED WITH THEM AND

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:46.425
AND IN JUST A ANA DOLE STORY WAS.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.393
THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE GOING OUT

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.228
TO AN OPERATOR WHERE THEY

00:13:49.295 --> 00:13:51.330
BELIEVE THE SAFETY CULTURE WAS

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.665
FOUR COMPARED TO ONE WHERE THEY

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:53.599
BELIEVE THE SAFETY CULTURE

00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.935
ACTION SAFE OR JUST NOT AS GOOD.

00:13:56.001 --> 00:14:01.273
AS ANOTHER ONE AND AND SO.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.374
THEY SHOULD THEY THEY GAVE AN

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:03.676
EXAMPLE OF WHERE -- LIKE FOR

00:14:03.742 --> 00:14:06.412
EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE ON RELIEF.

00:14:06.478 --> 00:14:08.080
HIGH PRESSURE RELIEF VALVES ARE

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:09.315
BEING LOOKED AT HOW ONE WHEN

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:10.849
UTILITY MAY OPERATE DIFFERENT

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.218
THAN ANOTHER.

00:14:12.284 --> 00:14:13.886
I'M SO IT'S IT WAS THE MESSAGE

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:15.854
THE MESSAGE I TOOK AWAY FROM

00:14:15.921 --> 00:14:17.189
THAT IS THE SAFETY CULTURE.

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:19.391
OF AN OPERATOR IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.393
AND HOW WELL A SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.195
SYSTEM ACTUALLY GETS TO ACTIVELY

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:25.831
IMPLEMENTED.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.900
SO -- SO IN IN SOCIALIZING THIS

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.568
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONCEPT

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:31.136
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE KEY

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.071
THINGS WILL BE THE SAFETY

00:14:32.137 --> 00:14:33.606
CULTURE WILL BE CORD TO HOW IT

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:34.807
HOW IT GETS.

00:14:34.873 --> 00:14:36.108
SO IN SOME CASES A UTILITY MAY

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.810
COME BACK AND SAY OH WE HAVE A

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:39.011
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:40.179
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HAVING A

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:42.214
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT'S

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.751
HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED -- I DON'T

00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:46.685
KNOW IF I GOT THERE YOU KNOW I

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:49.688
DID THAT THAT'S VERY TRUE AND

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:51.624
THANK YOU FOR THAT THE THE YOU

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:51.924
KNOW IF YOU.

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.926
THE THE REPORT THAT WE PUT

00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:55.761
TOGETHER FOR THE HEARING TODAY

00:14:55.828 --> 00:14:58.998
IF THE IT RAISES SOME CRITIQUES

00:14:59.064 --> 00:14:59.999
THAT THE I THINK.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:02.301
CRITICISMS OF OF THE SYSTEM

00:15:02.368 --> 00:15:03.736
TODAY BUT I AT YOU DON'T WANNA

00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:04.903
CLARIFY THOSE ARE MORE PROCESS

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.171
PRETTY TO ME THAT SHE'S BEEN THE

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:07.940
CHALLENGES THAT I THINK YOU'RE

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:09.775
FACING.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.076
IN THE LARGER ECHO THE CONCERNS

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:12.244
THAT WE RAISED DURING THE

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:13.312
SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING WE HAD IN.

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:15.080
OF ON SAFETY INTERVENOR IS IN

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:16.548
TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE WE DISCUSS

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:17.116
SOME OF THESE ISSUES WILL BE

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:18.484
QUESTIONED.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.286
QUESTION REALLY WHETHER THE CQC

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.688
WAS SETTING UP THE NEW OFFICE

00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.056
FAILURE OF THAT IT WAS.

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:24.690
THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES THERE

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.659
BUT YOU KNOW IS IT GOING TO WORK

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.360
AT THE END OF THE DAY IN AND IT

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:29.161
WORKED.

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:30.663
I AND I DON'T THINK YOU FAILED

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:32.364
AT ALL SO I DON'T WANT TO GIVE

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:33.565
THAT IMPRESSION I THINK YOU'VE

00:15:33.632 --> 00:15:35.567
OPERATED. FOR TWO YEARS WITH A

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.770
SMALL STAFF OF ENCOURAGING TO

00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:39.838
SEE TE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE.

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:42.141
NOW THAT I THINK MADE ME WORK A

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:43.842
LITTLE BETTER BUT OF IT'S HARD

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.344
TO SUCCEED SOMETIMES IN THOSE

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:46.679
CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:47.813
I AND I AND I REALLY WANT WANT

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.648
TO SEE.

00:15:49.715 --> 00:15:50.683
SEE THE EIGHT YOU KNOW THE

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:52.184
ESSAYS TO SUCCEED IN YOUR ANNUAL

00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:53.752
REPORT YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.054
THE PROCEEDINGS THAT OSA IS

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.389
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AND HOW DOES

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:00.826
YOUR OFFICE PRIORITIZE WHICH

00:16:00.893 --> 00:16:03.696
PROCEEDINGS TO BECOME ENGAGED

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:04.029
WITH A TO BE.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:04.897
A PARTY [inaudible]

00:16:04.963 --> 00:16:10.402
TO SO -- WE LOOK AT WHAT WE LOOK

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:12.838
AT IS WE GET ON WE DO ENGAGE

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.473
WITH COMMISSIONERS.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.743
AND WE WE DO LISTEN TO THEM IN

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.114
TERMS OF OF OF THEIR PRIORITIES.

00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:23.115
WE ALSO LOOK AT THE STANDARD

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.850
THAT WE HAVE.

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.419
AND SO WE HAVE A SO WE I

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:28.654
DESCRIBE THOSE THREE LARGE

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:31.223
CATEGORIES THEY'RE PRETTY BROAD.

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.491
AND AND ALSO BELIEVE THEY'RE

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.660
VERY VERY I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.462
THEY'RE VERY VERY IMPORTANT.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:38.630
AND SO -- OF WHAT WE DO IS WE

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:39.965
TRIED.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:43.602
TO RESPOND TO EACH ONE IN IN THE

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.304
MOST EFFICIENT WAY WEEK.

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:47.005
WHAT WE WITH THE RESOURCES WE

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:47.473
HAVE?

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:50.476
WITH AS WE GROW AND IF WE'RE

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:52.745
ABLE -- TO BUILD OUR RESOURCES

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.680
OVER TIME I THINK WE WOULD

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.582
BROADEN AND DEEPEN THE DEPTH

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:58.317
THAT WE WOULD GO INTO EACH OF

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.686
THESE THREE AREAS.

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:03.522
SO I BELIEVE THAT -- IN TERMS OF

00:17:03.589 --> 00:17:04.256
FOR EXAMPLE THAT COULD

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.458
COMMISSIONS ON SAFETY CULTURE

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.761
SAFETY MANAGEMENT.

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:12.197
WE DO CONTRIBUTE FOR EXAMPLE TO

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:13.866
LOOKING AT ARMS THIS STRATEGIC

00:17:13.932 --> 00:17:15.667
DIRECTIVE -- TO I'M AND THE

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:17.169
COMMISSION HAS COME OUT WITH A

00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:18.804
NEW ONE A NEW REVISION IN

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.005
FEBRUARY.

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:22.541
AND I SAY WILL JOIN WITH THE S.

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:25.177
C. D. ON THURSDAY COMMISSIONER

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.478
COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE JUST --

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.580
SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS STRATEGIC

00:17:28.647 --> 00:17:29.748
DIRECTIVE ODE.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:32.184
TO I'M ON AT THE END OF THIS

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:33.318
MONTH.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.186
AND SO WE WILL [inaudible]

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:37.089
PARTICIPATE.

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:38.424
THIS COMMISSION SAFETY CULTURE

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.625
SAFETY MANAGEMENT.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:41.860
WE DO WISH TO DEVOTE MORE

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:45.030
RESOURCES AND TIME TOWARDS

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:45.330
[inaudible]

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:46.698
LOADING.

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:47.699
IF WE ASK UTILITIES TO DO A

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.468
SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT.

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.503
WHAT CAN WE DO AS A COMMISSION

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.571
O DO OUR OWN SAFETY CULTURE

00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:54.139
ASSESSMENT AND TO LOOK AT OUR

OWN SELVES IN TERMS OF OUR OWN

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:58.076
SAFETY MANAGEMENT?

00:17:58.143 --> 00:17:59.511
I BELIEVE THAT WE YOU KNOW THE

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.613
COMMISSION IS CONTINUING TO

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.082
DEVELOP ITS STRATEGIC DIRECTOR --

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:05.651
IN IN SAFETY AND WE WISH TO BE

00:18:05.717 --> 00:18:07.419
PART OF THAT AND AS WE GROWING

00:18:07.486 --> 00:18:09.054
GET MORE RESOURCES I BELIEVE.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:11.156
WE WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE

00:18:11.223 --> 00:18:13.225
MORE IN THAT AREA I BELIEVE WE

00:18:13.292 --> 00:18:14.560
DO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE MORE IN

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.795
THAT AREA.

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:17.663
I ALSO BELIEVE IN PROCEEDINGS.

00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.499
WE WE CANNOT TAKE ON THE THE

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.768
LARGE DAMAGE OF PROGRAMS ARE IN

00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:24.203
A PROCEEDING FOR EXAMPLE A RATE

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:27.072
CASE SO AS I DESCRIBED THAT ONE

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:28.073
CASE WHERE THERE WAS A I FIND

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.007
FAILURE.

00:18:29.074 --> 00:18:30.375
WE LOOK AT THIS ONE SPECIFIC

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.044
ELEMENT WHICH TALKED ABOUT HOW

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.912
THEY DO THIS MECHANISM FOR

00:18:33.979 --> 00:18:35.347
PROJECTS SUBSTITUTION.

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:36.615
AND WE KEYED IN ON THAT AND MADE

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:38.150
A RECOMMENDATION SO THAT'S HOW

00:18:38.217 --> 00:18:39.318
WE GOT INVOLVED IN THAT

00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:40.786
PROCEEDINGS WHO ARE YOUR IS YOUR

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:43.288
PRIVATIZATION BASED ON THE THE

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:44.256
THE IN YOUR ENGAGEMENT

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:45.891
PROPORTIONAL TO THE STAFF THAT

ABSOLUTELY US -- THE THE OTHER

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.814
OTHER FACTORS BESIDES STAFF THAT

00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:10.649
WOULD PRECLUDE YOU FROM DOING

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:13.252
MORE OR THE ABILITY AND THE

00:19:13.318 --> 00:19:15.754
OTHER RESOURCES THAT YOU MIGHT

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:16.822
HAVE OTHER OTHER THINGS THAT

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.657
COULD IMPEDE YOU FROM.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:19.958
I'M DOING MORE WITH WOULD.

00:19:20.025 --> 00:19:22.494
HAVE TO HAPPEN.

00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:23.562
TO ENCOURAGE MORE ACTIVITY OR IS

00:19:23.629 --> 00:19:25.964
THERE ANYTHING THAT.

00:19:26.031 --> 00:19:27.332
IT WOULD OTHER THAN RESOURCE

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:27.633
[inaudible]

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:30.502
I'M.

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:33.405
I BELIEVE THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:38.277
THE I I BELIEVE THAT.

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:39.611
YOU KNOW WE'RE WHERE ONE

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:40.979
DIVISION AS PART OF A LARGE

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:43.115
COMMISSION.

00:19:43.181 --> 00:19:43.582
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:44.550
COMMISSION.

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:47.486
AS IT AS A WHOLE COULD BENEFIT

00:19:47.553 --> 00:19:49.788
FROM GREATER RESOURCES BECAUSE

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.890
EVEN AS WE ARRANGE FOR EXAMPLE

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:54.092
THIS TRAINING COMING UP IN JUNE.

00:19:54.159 --> 00:19:56.662
I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE

00:19:56.728 --> 00:19:58.163
RESOURCES THAT COULD BENEFIT

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.998
LIKE YOU KNOW THAT TAKES GETTING%

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:01.300
A CONTRACT.

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:03.302
THERE'S A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.704
THE COMMISSION HAS WHICH IS I

00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:07.706
THINK COULD BENEFIT FROM GREATER

00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:09.374
RESOURCES.

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:10.576
AND I'LL JUST.

PROCEEDINGS THEY THEY REMAIN TO

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:40.198

00:21:40.265 --> 00:21:42.034
PROCEEDINGS AT SUCH A TIME

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.669
WHAT'S LONG TIME LINE.

00:21:43.735 --> 00:21:45.170

WE FEEL LIKE WE GET THE BEST.

00:22:17.335 --> 00:22:19.204
I FEEL LIKE WE DO OUR BEST WHEN

WE TAKE THE INPUT FROM THE MOST.

00:22:21.773 --> 00:22:23.875
FROM THE MOST PEOPLE SO THAT WE

00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:25.677
GET WHERE WE'RE NOT JUST.

00:22:25.744 --> 00:22:27.312
OPERATING IN A VACUUM WE WE

00:22:27.379 --> 00:22:28.780
ANNEX WE ENGAGE WITH THE WITH

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.482
THE OTHER SAFETY STAFF AT THE

WE MEET WITH.

00:22:39.591 --> 00:22:40.826
SOME EXIT THESE OUTSIDE EXPERTS

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:42.694

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:44.496
SO THAT WE CAN.

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:47.733

IN THAT IS HELPFUL IN.

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:54.706
IF YOU KNOW THE JUST THE

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:55.340
SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH

00:22:55.407 --> 00:22:55.974
INTERESTED IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:22:57.476 --> 00:23:00.112
IN MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE CPUC.

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:01.947
AS IN ALL THE UTILITIES HOW HOW

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:02.914
HAS IN HAVE.

00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.583
YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE THE

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:05.851
FOUR PILLARS OF THE SAFETY

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.886
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND HOW HAS

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:10.922
THE OF DOES IT BEEN INCORPORATED

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:12.758
AT ALL IN THE CPUC SAFETY

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.126
POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE.

00:23:14.192 --> 00:23:15.327
THERE BEEN ANY.

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:17.629
ANY WORK IN IN THAT AND AND I

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.131
ENJOYED READING THROUGH THOSE IN

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:22.834
THE THE PACKETS OF INFORMATION

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.636
WAS PROVIDED AT THE END OF THE

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:25.270
THOSE.

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:28.039
THE SPORT COLORS OF A SAFETY

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:30.175
MANAGEMENT SMS AS HAS IT BEEN.

00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:31.676
AND YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S BEEN

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.979
WORKING WITH UTILITIES.

00:23:34.045 --> 00:23:35.981
MAYBE NOT AS MUCH WITH THE UC

00:23:36.047 --> 00:23:37.682
ITSELF.

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:39.284
HAS THERE BEEN SOME EFFORTS IN

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:40.018
THAT REGARD.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.853
YEAH SO I'M IN THE MOST RECENT

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.755
STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE THAT THAT

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.891
THE COMMISSIONERS ADOPTED IN

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:46.892
THEIR COMMISSIONER COMMITTEE

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:47.692
MEANS.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:49.361
THEY'VE THEY'VE [inaudible]

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:51.429
THEY'VE.

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:52.697
STEVE HIGHLIGHTED I'M.

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:54.633
THE FOR KIND OF REORGANIZE ST

00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:57.369
STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE OF TWO I'M

00:23:57.435 --> 00:24:00.605
AND AND SO NOW IT IT.

00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:02.741
IS BROKEN DOWN INTO.

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:05.677
OBJECTIVES FOR THE UTILITIES AND

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:07.746
OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMMISSION IS

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:09.014
VERY IS VERY BRIEF IT'S VERY

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.148
SHORT ANSWER LIKE THE

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:12.350
OVERARCHING VISION IS HOW I

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:13.218
WOULD INTERPRET IT.

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:18.423
I'M AND I THINK THAT ON I THINK

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.627
THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES. TO

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:24.229
FOR AN AND THEY I THINK THE

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:25.664
STRATEGIC DIRECTORS ARE ARE THE

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.365
STRATEGIC DIRECTORS FOR STAFF SO

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:29.000
WHEN WE GO BEFORE THE

00:24:29.067 --> 00:24:29.634
COMMISSIONERS AT THE END OF THE

00:24:29.701 --> 00:24:30.635
MONTH.

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:32.070
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKING US

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:33.872
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO IMPLEMENT

00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:35.674
OUR STRATEGIC DIRECTORS AND

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.043
THEY'RE GONNA ASK US METRICS ON

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.644
HOW WE'RE SHOWING THAT WE ARE.

00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:41.479
ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THEY'RE WHAT

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.315
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SO I BELIEVE

00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:46.218
THAT'S THE COMMISSIONERS LOOKING

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:48.386
TO STAFF INCLUDING -- ESSAY WILL

00:24:48.453 --> 00:24:50.555
BE PART OF THE ESPY -- TO I'M

00:24:50.622 --> 00:24:51.857
AND AND THEY'LL THEY'LL THEY'LL

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:53.925
BE I IMAGINE THEY'LL BE TOUGH

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.461
HONEST TO OUR OWN ROLE I THINK

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:58.029
THAT IS THAT.

00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.397
WE HAVEN'T MEASURED UP TO WHERE

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:01.633
I THINK WE NEED TO BE YOU KNOW

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.068
FROM FROM OUR OWN LITTLE.

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:03.969
AND I THINK THAT.

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.437
THEY WOULD PROBABLY WILL

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:07.439
PROBABLY ASK US TO DO MORE.

00:25:07.505 --> 00:25:09.074
AND SO.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.641
AND I THINK THAT THE BROAD

00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.877
VISION IS IS IN THE STRATEGIC

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:13.245
DIRECTIVE I THINK THERE'S AN

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:15.280
OPPORTUNITY TO DRILL DOWN INTO

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:18.416
THAT AND TO BRING IT DOWN IT'S A

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.517
MORE.

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:20.318
PHYSICAL CONCRETE SORT OF LIKE

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:23.255
MECHANISMS AND PROGRAMS THAT THE

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.656
COMMISSION AND THEN.

00:25:24.723 --> 00:25:27.292
FURTHER CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE SO

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.294
I THINK THAT IN FACT IN RESPONSE

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.863
TO THIS BILL -- SB ONE NINETY

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:32.931
NINE FIRST TIME I REALLY EVER

00:25:32.998 --> 00:25:34.366
SAT DOWN WITH THE INDEPENDENT

00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.334
AUDITOR.

00:25:36.401 --> 00:25:37.569
WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION.

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:42.207
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT YOU

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:43.975
KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE CAN THEN DO

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.877
FOLLOW UP SO IF THEY'RE THERE

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:46.378
ARE OPPORTUNITIES -- TO

00:25:46.444 --> 00:25:48.146
IDENTIFIED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.982
THE COMMISSION'S OWN SAFETY

00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:52.851
MANAGEMENT SAFETY CULTURE.

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.719
I THINK THAT IN WORKING WITH THE

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:55.687
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR.

00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:58.523
THAT LEVERAGES ANOTHER RESOURCE --

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.659
TO KIND OF CLOSE THE LOOP ON

00:26:00.725 --> 00:26:01.960
THINGS SO AND THINGS COME UP AND

00:26:02.027 --> 00:26:03.295
THEY CAN THEN BE.

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:06.031
ADDRESSED -- IN A METHODICAL WAY.

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:07.832
YOU MENTIONED SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:08.800
STANDARD CHILDREN IN THE TRUCK

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:10.101
ARE YOU REFERRING TO WHAT DO YOU

00:26:10.168 --> 00:26:10.936
ACTUALLY MEAN BY THAT IS THAT

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:13.104
THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF

00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:16.508
THE FOR COLORS THE WE TALKED

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:18.710
ABOUT OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT.

00:26:18.777 --> 00:26:19.945
AND HOW WOULD APPLY TO THE CPU

00:26:20.011 --> 00:26:22.314
TODAY SURE SO FOR EXAMPLE FAA

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:24.382
USES FOR LIKE THAT FOUR PILLAR

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:29.654
APPROACH IN IN THEIR BROAD ON

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:31.356
REQUIREMENTS.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.692
AND THEN IN IN THE GAS PIPELINE

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:34.626
ONE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:35.226
SOMETHING LIKE TEN ELEMENTS I

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:36.094
THINK AND THEY BREAK IT DOWN

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.596
INTO A LEADERSHIP STAKEHOLDER

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:40.832
ENGAGEMENT.

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:41.366
MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE RISK

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.768
MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL CONTROLS

00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:45.770
THAT SORT OF THING.

00:26:45.837 --> 00:26:47.772
AS AS A BACKGROUND FROM AN

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:48.940
ENGINEER.

00:26:49.007 --> 00:26:51.109
I I I GET MORE BENEFIT OUT OF

00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:53.345
HAVING THINGS MORE CONCRETE MORE

00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:55.981
SORT OF LIKE BROKEN DOWN SO I

00:26:56.047 --> 00:26:59.184
THINK THAT. FOR UTILITIES IN

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.118
PARTICULAR WITH THAT A GAS

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:01.720
PIPELINE STANDARD THERE'S A LOT

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.355
OF VALUE IN HAVING IT BROKEN

00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:04.823
DOWN TO THE ELEMENTS AND THEN

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:05.991
SOME I CAN GO IN AND ASSESS EACH

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:07.292
ELEMENT.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.160
I DON'TTHINK WE NECESSARILY

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:10.695
BROKE IN OUR OWN SAFETY

00:27:10.762 --> 00:27:12.197
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOWN TO THAT

00:27:12.263 --> 00:27:12.897
ELEMENT.

00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:14.265
I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

00:27:14.332 --> 00:27:17.736
THAT WE WE CAN DO AND THAT WE

00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.237
CAN ALWAYS SAY CAN.

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.139
OR THE AND THE COMMISSION.

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:22.841
CAN CAN GET FURTHER BENEFIT BY

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.776
DRILLING DOWN AND BRINGING THAT

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:26.811
DOWN INTO A DEEPER LEVEL OF

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:28.747
ELEMENTS THAT WAY YOU CAN LOOK

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:29.948
AT THE ELEMENT.

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:31.783
AND ASSESS THAT ELEMENT THE

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.151
PILLAR IS A LITTLE HARDER A

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:35.020
LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT WELL ARE

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:36.354
WE DO WE REALLY HAVE THAT KILLER

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:38.323
IN PLACE BUT IF WE TALK ABOUT

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:38.690
LIKE.

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:39.958
WHAT'S OUR STAKEHOLDER

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:41.559
ENGAGEMENT WATER OUR PROGRAMS

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:43.495
AND PROCESSES TO DO THAT HOW IT

00:27:43.561 --> 00:27:46.131
WENT HOW DO WE FOSTER SPEAK UP.

00:27:46.197 --> 00:27:47.465
CULTURE HOW ARE WE ASSESS SCENE

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:51.403
IF WE HAVE THAT -- AND THAT'S

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:53.471
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT.

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:54.672
WE WE IT WILL CTUALLY BE PART

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:55.340
OF THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.708
TRAINING MAKE IT DOWN INTO HOW

00:27:56.775 --> 00:27:58.510
YOU IMPLEMENT THESE THANKS NOW

00:27:58.576 --> 00:27:59.911
THAT'S FOR UTILITY.

00:27:59.978 --> 00:28:03.048
BUT I I THINK THEY'RE VERY.

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:05.150
THE THE I THINK IT CROSSES OVER

00:28:05.216 --> 00:28:06.985
TO REGULATED THERE'S GONNA BE A

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:08.787
CORRESPONDING SORT OF ELEMENT

00:28:08.853 --> 00:28:10.455
THAT WOULD BE PART OF A SAFETY

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.890
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:15.060
OKAY A I UNDERSTAND THE OF YOU

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:16.428
ALSO MENTIONED THE SAFETY FLAG

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:18.630
PROGRAM THAT THAT YOU HAVE IN

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:19.697
THE SYSTEM HI I THOUGHT WHAT'S

00:28:19.764 --> 00:28:20.999
WHAT'S THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:22.434
HOW DOES THAT.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.402
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU?

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:27.705
USE THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS AND

00:28:27.772 --> 00:28:29.707
PROCEDURE OF A SAFETY FLAG.

00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:30.775
SO I'M JUST HIS FINGERS REALLY

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:33.778
QUICK THE SAFETY FLAG IS IS IS

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:35.413
INTENDED.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.082
FOR BRING FORWARD ISSUES THAT

00:28:37.148 --> 00:28:38.483
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT UTILITY SOME

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.784
SOME PEOPLE CONFUSE THEM WITH A

00:28:39.851 --> 00:28:41.486
WHISTLE BLOWER WHICH MIGHT BE IN

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:42.987
A UTILITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.389
OR FOLKS MIGHT.

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.457
CONFUSE IT WITH SOME OTHER

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:47.258
SAFETY REPORTING THAT COMES INTO

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:48.860
THE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE BUT THE

00:28:48.927 --> 00:28:50.495
SAFETY FLAG AS PRIMARILY AND

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:52.764
IT'S ALSO NOT SOMETHING LIKE IF

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:54.365
THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT.

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.967
EMPLOYER BUILDING WHICH I

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:57.235
NORMALLY GOES TO A SEPARATE

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:58.970
GROUP AT THE COMMISSION THAT HAS

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:00.538
TO DO WITH ISSUES WITH THE

00:29:00.605 --> 00:29:02.173
BUILDING OR SOME KIND A HAZARD

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.341
WITH THE ROOM OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:29:03.408 --> 00:29:03.541
THAT.

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.977
BUT THE SAFETY FLAG IS INTENDED

00:29:06.044 --> 00:29:08.046
TO BE FOR UTILITIES AND IT CAN

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:10.081
COME FROM ANYWHERE CAN COME FROM

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:11.716
BUT IN PARTICULAR A STAFF FIND

00:29:11.783 --> 00:29:13.818
SOMETHING THAT'S OF A CONCERN.

00:29:13.885 --> 00:29:15.086
THEY CAN RAISE IT TO BE

00:29:15.153 --> 00:29:17.222
ADDRESSED ON WE'VE MADE USE OF

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:19.257
IT LIKE I MENTIONED FOR THE ON

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:20.859
TRANSFORMERS THAT WE SAW BEING

00:29:20.925 --> 00:29:22.327
ADDRESSED AS A HIGH RISK ASK

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:24.929
EXPEDITED ISSUE WITH ONE UTILITY.

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:26.498
BUT WE DIDN'T SEE IT IN ANOTHER

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:28.399
UTILITIES -- GENERATE CASE

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:30.802
APPLICATION HOW DO YOU FOLLOW UP

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:31.503
WITH THOSE FLAG SO.

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:34.172
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE I WOULD

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:39.010
SAY WHEAT THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE.

00:29:39.077 --> 00:29:40.578
IT IS NOW BEING RE IS NOW BEING

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:41.913
REVISED AND SO  THINK THAT

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.214
THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE

00:29:43.281 --> 00:29:44.949
CAN DO A GREATER FOLLOW UP

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:46.351
BECAUSE I THINK THAT OUR OUR

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:48.653
TIME LAG ON RESPONDING TO THOSE

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.755
IS IS NOT WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

00:29:50.822 --> 00:29:52.757
AND HOW WOULD INFLUENCE OF

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:53.591
PROCEEDING.

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:56.995
THE WHOLE THE ENTIRE FLAG SYSTEM.

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:57.495
SO A FIFTY FLAG DOESN'T

00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:59.264
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.565
EMPLOYMENT TO PROCEEDING

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.233
ALTHOUGH I COULD BUT IF A SAFETY

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:02.800
FLAG.

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:05.303
RAISED AN ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.704
IN OUR CASE WITH THE YOU KNOW

00:30:06.771 --> 00:30:09.107
CONCERNED ABOUT A HIGH RISK WITH

00:30:09.174 --> 00:30:10.441
THE LARGE AWFUL TRANCE FROM HIGH

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:11.142
RISE BUILDING.

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:12.210
IT COULD BE A PIECE OF

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.611
INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:15.113
CERTAINLY USE IF WE THEN WE'RE

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.215
IN A PROCEEDING WHERE WE COULD.

00:30:17.282 --> 00:30:19.284
ASK OKAY WHAT IT WHAT IS THIS

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.318
UTILITY DOING ABOUT IN THE

00:30:20.385 --> 00:30:22.086
SAFETY FLAG WE INITIATED IT HAD

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:23.221
TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC.

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:26.024
UTILITY WHERE WE WE COULDN'T GET

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.091
INTO THE RATE CASE AT THAT TIME --

00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:29.160
IT COULD ALSO BE USED IF THERE'S

00:30:29.227 --> 00:30:31.095
AN ISSUE IT COULD BE LOOKED AT

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:32.797
IS THIS A BROAD PROBLEM ACROSS

00:30:32.864 --> 00:30:35.066
MULTIPLE UTILITIES SHOULD WE

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:36.201
ADDRESS THIS IN A RULE MAKING.

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:37.735
SHOULD WE SHOULD WE REACH OUT

00:30:37.802 --> 00:30:39.437
AND SEE WHETHER WE NEED TO

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:45.109
ADDRESS IS -- IN BEYOND FOR

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.878
EXAMPLE HOW IS FIRST -- BROUGHT

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:47.378
TO THE ATTENTION OF THE

00:30:47.445 --> 00:30:48.146
COMMISSION SO I THINK IT CAN BE

00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.614
USED IN A PROCEEDING AND IT'S

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.549
ALSO S. ACTUALLY IT'S ONE OF THE

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:53.117
METRICS NOW.

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.586
THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE IN

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:56.888
ITS NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE --

00:30:56.955 --> 00:30:58.690
TO WHERE THEY WANT TO GET.

00:30:58.756 --> 00:31:01.125
INFORMATION ON BOTH THE INTERNAL

00:31:01.192 --> 00:31:02.594
AND EXTERNAL USE OF THE SAFETY

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.095
FLAG SO THEY WANT THE COMMISSION

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.064
IS LOOKING NOW TO GET MORE

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.299
INFORMATION ON THAT BROUGHT FOR

00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:10.335
TO THE COMMISSIONERS.

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:12.370
SO YOU FIND IT SUCCESSFUL THE AT

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.372
THIS POINT THAT I I I BELIEVE

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:15.306
THAT WE'VE BROUGHT SOME SOME

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:16.541
ISSUES FORWARD I BELIEVE THAT.

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:18.309
IT CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:20.445
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:22.080
OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE IT.

00:31:22.146 --> 00:31:23.448
IN THE PAST WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:24.816
SAME VIEWS THE STAFF THAT.

00:31:24.882 --> 00:31:27.085
THAT NO ONE SHOULD KNOW AS MUCH

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:29.220
ABOUT THE ABOUT UTILITY

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:30.755
EQUIPMENT OPERATION AS THE

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.957
UTILITY OPERATORS THEMSELVES AND

00:31:33.024 --> 00:31:33.791
NO.

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.059
ONE COULD KNOW AS MUCH -- IS

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:36.694
THEY KNOW.

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:37.996
YOU SHARE THAT VIEW POINT

00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:38.296
[inaudible]

00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.964
I'M [inaudible]

00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:43.835
SO -- A COUPLE FIGHTS ARE I I

00:31:43.901 --> 00:31:45.937
BELIEVE UTILITIES OFTEN ARE ARE

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:49.007
THE EXPERTS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND

00:31:49.073 --> 00:31:50.541
AND AND AND AND AND IN MANY

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:53.077
AREAS AND AND AND SO.

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.779
I BELIEVE A SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.848
SYSTEM FOR UTILITIES KINDA

00:31:56.914 --> 00:31:58.583
LEVERAGES THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.018
A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.252
REQUIRE FOR THE UTILITIES THE

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.354
NOW THE UTILITY IN ORDER TO

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:03.955
IMPLEMENT A SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:04.656
SYSTEM.

00:32:04.722 --> 00:32:05.423
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.924
THE EXPERTISE THEY HAVE TO MAKE

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:08.426
SURE THAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING ALL

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.093
THESE ISSUES.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.563
SO RATHER THAN HAVING US GO OUT

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.033
AND FIFTY MANAGE FOR THE UTILITY

00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:16.167
THE SAFETY YOU TO THE UTILITY

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:17.568
WILL DEVELOP A SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.803
SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES AN

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.538
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMISSION

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.607
IN SOME FORM TO ASSESS.

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.542
THAT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.977
WE CAN ASSESS IT.

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.378
EVEN IF WE WERE LIKE NATIONAL

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:28.680
ENERGY BOARD OF CANADA WE CAN

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:30.782
CONDUCT AUDITS ON IT WE CAN LOOK

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:32.884
FOR GAPS WE CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.185
FOR MAKING SURE THAT.

00:32:34.252 --> 00:32:36.354
THEY'RE THERE IS EVERY PROCEDURE

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.222
AND PROCESS FOLLOWED BUT WE CAN

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.091
LOOK TO SEE HOW IS THIS BEING

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:42.493
FOLLOWED BROADLY IS IS UTILITY

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.329
DOING IT SO I BELIEVE THAT IT'S

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.897
IMPORTANT FOR THE UTILITY DID TO

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:46.431
DO IT.

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:48.533
ALSO I BELIEVE THE COMMISSION

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:49.967
PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE

00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:52.003
WE CAN FIND GAPS I MEAN WE GET

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.238
TO SEE LOTS OF UTILITIES WE SEE

00:32:54.305 --> 00:32:55.940
A UTILITY HAS SOME PROGRAM.

00:32:56.007 --> 00:32:58.142
ANOTHER UTILITY DOESN'T IS THAT

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.010
BECAUSE I'M PORTANT SAFETY

00:32:59.077 --> 00:33:00.611
PROGRAM IS THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:02.246
DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM WHERE

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.214
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT RISK.

00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:04.816
CAN WE IDENTIFY IT AND THEN

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:06.117
SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.419
UTILITY AND THEN HAVE THEM NOT

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.288
HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LEARNING A

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:12.290
LESSON ABOUT THIS DO YOU THINK

00:33:12.357 --> 00:33:14.258
THAT THAT -- YOU KNOW THE THE

00:33:14.325 --> 00:33:15.993
IDEA OF THE UTILITY.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.762
IN THE NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:18.963
THAN THEY KNOW IT AND WHICH IS

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.334
FINE TO DOES THAT EVER LEAVE

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:25.636
WITH PEOPLE OR THE THE UC

00:33:25.703 --> 00:33:26.771
EMPLOYEES FEELING ON QUALIFIED

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:27.739
TO DO THE JOB OR THAT YOU HAVE

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:31.309
TO RELY ON THEIR ACTIONS -- YOU

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:32.443
MENTION THE TO AND YOU COME BACK

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.878
AND GET A REASSESS WHAT THEY'RE

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:35.747
DOING TO EVALUATE WHAT THEY'RE

00:33:35.813 --> 00:33:36.414
DOING.

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:39.217
YOU FEEL QUALIFIED TO DO THAT --

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:42.353
BASED ON THE THE CONCEPT OF

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.055
THINKING THAT THEY ARE NO ONE

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:45.189
KNOWS IT BETTER THAN THEY DO ARE

00:33:45.256 --> 00:33:47.325
KNOWN AS MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:50.661
IT DIDN'T AND THEN THE OPERATORS.

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:54.098
I'D LIKE TO COME TO THAT.

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.466
ONE WAS THAT YES.

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.402
SO ON I THINK FOR THE CONFUSION

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:58.970
MIGHT BE IS THAT YOU KNOW OF IN

00:33:59.036 --> 00:34:00.071
SOME REGARDS YES.

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:01.472
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL AHEAD

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.241
OPERATOR HOT OPERATIONS SYSTEM.

00:34:03.307 --> 00:34:04.642
EVERY SYSTEM OUT THERE IS

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:07.945
CUSTOMIZED BUT WE DEFINITELY

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:10.648
HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO SAY OKAY

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.583
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR STATUS SYSTEM

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:13.584
YOU KNOW THIS CASE SYSTEM IS.

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:16.320
SO TELL ME HOW IT'S DESIGNED

00:34:16.387 --> 00:34:18.089
TELL ME HOW IT OPERATES TELL ME

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.358
IF YOU HAVE CIRCUITS OVER HERE

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.393
THAT YOU CAN SHUT DOWN REMOTELY.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.162
SO YES DEFINITELY WE ARE

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.997
OVERSEEING WHAT THEY'RE DOING

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:27.632
HOW THEY'RE OPERATING IS THERE

00:34:27.698 --> 00:34:30.334
SYSTEM VERY OLD I MEAN IS THE

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:32.737
ARE THEY USING. THREE PHASE

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.138
CIRCUITS THAT ARE GROUNDED THAT

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.007
ARE VERY UNSTABLE I MEAN THAT'S

00:34:36.073 --> 00:34:38.609
A BIG CONCERN WE KNOW ABOUT THAT

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:39.310
NO WE CAN QUESTION THEM ABOUT

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:40.278
THAT.

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.546
IN THE POWER INDUSTRY IS VERY

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:43.147
OLD I MEAN THE TECHNOLOGY IS

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:45.016
VERY VERY OLD SO THERE

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.651
DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE UPGRADES

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:48.886
SO THEY NEED SOMEBODY LIKE US TO

00:34:48.953 --> 00:34:51.088
PUSH HIM. TO MAKE THE SYSTEM

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:52.557
SAFER THE IDEA RELIABLE THAT YOU

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:54.058
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEIR

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:55.693
SYSTEM AS WELL AS THEY DO BUT

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.894
YOU CAN COME IN WITH A CRITICAL

00:34:56.961 --> 00:35:01.265
EYE AND AND AND MAKE.

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:02.867
IT CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:05.503
HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.238
WELL LET ME CLARIFY THAT SO FOR

00:35:07.305 --> 00:35:09.106
INSTANCE IF THERE THERE'S GOING

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:10.007
TO BE A LOT OF D. ENERGIES ASIAN

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.342
THIS NEXT YEAR THERE'SGOING TO

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.743
BE A LOT OF BLACKOUT PERIODS

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:14.445
DURING THE WINDY SEASON IN THE

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:17.882
FALL -- TO COME IN AND TELL THEM

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:20.218
HOW TO HOW TO ACTUALLY MANUALLY

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:22.053
SHUT DOWN THOSE CIRCUITS I DON'T

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:23.454
THINK WE GET DOWN INTO THE NUTS

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:24.589
AND BOLTS OF THAT THEY KNOW

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:26.224
THEIR SYSTEM.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.658
HOW TO BRING THE ENERGY BACK UP

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:28.726
I DON'T KNOW IF THE COMMISSION

00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:29.727
IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.896
EXACTLY WHAT SWITCHES TO THROW

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:33.531
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF?

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:34.932
BUT ON THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT

00:35:34.999 --> 00:35:36.033
VIEW LEVEL.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.535
HOW YOU YOU KNOW HOW OLD IS YOUR

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.237
SYSTEM AND HOW ARE YOU MANAGING

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:41.138
IT ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE THAT

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.540
EXPERTISE SO WE NEED TO PUSH IN

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:43.774
THE RIGHT DIRECTION? TO MAKE IT

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:46.544
SAFER.

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:47.845
LET'S IS VERY GOOD FOR THE IT

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:49.080
MAKES GOOD SENSE I MEAN I THINK

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:50.948
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ROLE

00:35:51.015 --> 00:35:51.549
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:54.852
DOING TO THAT LOOK AT IT IN THAT --

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:58.389
IN ADVANCE OF THE HAVE YOU.

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:00.024
IS THE OFFICE COULD KIND OF GONE

00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:02.760
OUT OF ITS WAY. TO EDUCATE THE

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:04.529
COMMISSION ITSELF OF

00:36:04.595 --> 00:36:06.564
COMMISSIONERS ON ON A SOME OF

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:07.598
THE VIEWS THAT YOU HAVE ON

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:10.268
SAFETY ISSUES AND I'M TRYING.

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.036
TO TRYING TO TO TO BRING.

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:13.905
THE FEW SEE TO A LEVEL OF OF

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:16.107
SAFETY COMPETENCE THAT THEY MAY

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:19.777
NOT HAVE HAD BEFORE.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:24.982
ON SO -- SO.

00:36:25.049 --> 00:36:28.619
WE HAVE ON OUR HI FOR EXAMPLE WE

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.354
HAD THETHE SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:32.723
SYSTEM ON BONK.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.525
ON AND AND IN THAT WAY WE

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:35.927
BROUGHT IN EXPERTS TO KINDA

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:38.095
EDUCATE THEM ON THAT NGUYEN

00:36:38.162 --> 00:36:39.030
WHERE PROCEEDINGS.

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:41.599
CERTAINLY WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:44.135
CASE FOR WHY WE THINK THE

00:36:44.201 --> 00:36:47.939
COMMISSION SHOULD -- SHOULD --

00:36:48.005 --> 00:36:50.174
EXCEPT -- ESSAYS RECOMMENDATION

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:52.076
AND THEN WHEN WE ARE OUTSIDE OF

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:53.878
PROCEEDINGS -- WHEN WE HAVE AN

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.980
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE

00:36:56.047 --> 00:37:00.184
COMMISSIONERS -- THEN WE CAN FOR

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:02.253
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WITH THE SAFETY

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.290
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- PROPOSAL

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.758
THAT WE WISH TO BRING FOR THEM

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:09.760
WE CAN EDUCATE THEM ABOUT

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:10.061
[inaudible]

00:37:10.127 --> 00:37:13.497
OF WHY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:18.502
THAT'S WORTH DOING -- WE DO HAVE --

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.605
YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE IN WITH

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:21.172
MORE SELF WE GET THE MARS

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:22.506
COMMISSIONERS ARE REALLY BUSY

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:23.608
ONE THING I GOT TO MENTION IS

00:37:23.674 --> 00:37:26.310
THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE SAFETY

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.345
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOND.

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:29.614
A COUPLE OF THE SPEAKERS WHO

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.781
SPOKE BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS.

00:37:30.848 --> 00:37:32.016
I TOLD ME AFTERWARDS HOW

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.484
IMPRESSED THEY WERE ACTUALLY

00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:36.087
ABOUT THE THE LEVEL OF QUESTIONS

00:37:36.153 --> 00:37:37.822
THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:38.389
COMMISSIONERS THEY ACTUALLY

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:39.590
THOUGHT THAT.

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:40.891
IT COMPARED TO I GUESS OR

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:42.526
EXPERIENCE MAY BE ANOTHER

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:43.961
REGULATORY ONES THAT THEY

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:45.997
THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD SOME

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:46.931
REALLY.

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.066
IN NOW TARGET IN AND AND AND

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:50.835
KNOWLEDGEABLE QUESTIONS THAT

00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:51.469
THEY WERE ASKED FROM THE

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:52.737
COMMISSIONERS.

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:55.239
SO -- THEY ARE IN SOME WAYS THEY

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.540
SEE.

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.142
MAYBE MORE WITH AND WE SEE

00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.310
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:00.845
TIME TO GO TO ALL OF THE

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:02.213
COMMISSION OR COMMITTEE MEETINGS

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:04.982
AND ALL THE COMMISSIONER --

00:38:05.049 --> 00:38:07.418
MEETINGS THAT THEY GO -- TO AND

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.620
AND I THINK AS WE GROW AND AS WE

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:16.394
KIND OF ESTABLISH OURSELVES --

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:16.927
TO TO TO BE ABLE TO BRING

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:17.428
FORWARD MORE SPECIFIC

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:20.398
RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK THE

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:21.699
VALUE IT I'VE AT LEAST HEARD.

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.367
A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR I THINK

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.802
THEY WOULD LIKE MORE OF ARE IN

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:27.371

00:38:27.438 --> 00:38:29.240
WE WOULD.

00:38:29.306 --> 00:38:30.908
THAT'S KIND OF ON US TO BE ABLE

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.411
TO BE ABLE TO CARVE THAT OUT TO

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.413
PROVIDE MORE OF THAT INPUT.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.481
GOOD TO ADD ON TO THAT THE TRAIN

HELPFUL AND AND IT.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.201
IT REALLY IS IS TRYING TO IS I

00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:04.735
SEE IT.

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:05.970
GOING TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON

00:40:06.036 --> 00:40:09.306
HOW SAFETY IS THIS WORKING.

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.574
IS THIS DOING MAYBE TO SOON TO

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:11.142
TELL.

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.611
OF BUT IS WE GET INTO THE NEXT

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:15.045
TO THIS CONVERSATION THE NEXT

00:40:15.112 --> 00:40:16.714
PANEL WILL LOOK AT KIND OF THE

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.115
WAY THAT FOCUS AND ATTENTION

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:20.584
SHOULD BE AND IS IS THIS THE

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.787
RIGHT PLACE FOR IT AND BUT IT

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.155
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING.

00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:26.357
EVERYTHING YOU CAN ADD A COUPLE

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:27.391
OF COURSE -- WHEN THE EARLIER IN

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.559
THE DISCUSSION WE WERE TALKING

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:31.362
ABOUT RESOURCES AND STAFF AND?

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.196
WE REALLY HAVE BEEN OPERATING

00:40:32.263 --> 00:40:34.532
WITH ALMOST NO ADMIN STUFF WHICH

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.333
TAKES YOU KNOW WE'VE GT SENIOR

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.202
ENGINEERS WERE DOING CONTRACT

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.670
WORK WE'RE DOING ADMIN WORK AND

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:42.640
THAT'S REALLY TAKING AWAY FROM.

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:43.908
THE BATTLES WOULD BE FIGHTING.

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:46.811
SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A BIG

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:47.778
THING THIS PAST YEAR HOLDING US

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:49.647
BACK SO WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:50.281
PERSON THAT WE'RE GONNA HIGHER

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:52.082
BUT TO EXPAND.

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:53.017
AND HAVE THE SAME KIND OF

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:55.119
SUPPORT THAT OTHER GROUPS IN THE

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.921
COMMISSION YOU KNOW THAT THEY

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.756
HAVE UNDER THEM THAT WOULD BE

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.357
TREMENDOUS.

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:02.159
AND THEN ALSO JUST PICK INNER

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.427
BATTLES BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:05.162
LIMITED RESOURCES WE DO LOOK AT

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.597
EVERY PROCEEDING IN EVERY

00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:11.769
INVESTIGATION AND EVERY RULE

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.370
MAKING GOING OKAY.

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:14.572
WHAT CAN WE WIN IN THIS ONE OKAY

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:16.207
WE OUT OF FOCUS AND THE ON THAT

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:17.641
ONCE WE DO REALLY?

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:18.776
GOOD HERE HAS VERY GOOD HERE ARE

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:19.877
DEFINED AS SOMETHING HOLDING YOU

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:22.246
BACK OR KEEPING YOU FROM KIND OF

00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:23.314
DOING WHAT YOU WANTED OTHER THAN

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:24.648
THE RESOURCE ISSUE IN THE THE

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:26.083
MANPOWER ISSUE THE CHANGES THERE

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.117
ARE CHALLENGES WITH THAT.

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:27.885
WELL WE WE WE HOUSE THE BENEFIT

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.086
OF USING THE COMMISSION'S

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:29.820
ATTORNEYS.

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:31.155
WHICH WE HAVE TO HAVE ATTORNEYS

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:33.257
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:35.359
FROM THE ATTORNEYS THAT WE

00:41:35.426 --> 00:41:36.894
REALLY WERE SUPPOSED TO GET.

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.229
SO THAT THAT'S HOLDING US BACK

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.964
BECAUSE WE WE DEFINITELY NEED

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.199
THAT IT SUPPORT WITH ATTORNEYS

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.034
TO TO HELP OUR POSITION AND

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:45.803
DEVICES.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:49.273
ALLEN PROCEEDINGS SO THAT'S BEEN

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.143
A STRUGGLE.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:53.711
TO THEN I WOULD JUST I WOULD

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.446
JUST SAY THAT -- QUICKLY ON TO

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.948
THE WANT ONE SENSE IS -- I THINK

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.016
THE UTILITIES TO FOCUS THEY DO

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:00.084
RESPOND I THINK TO THE

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.085
COMMISSION'S FOCUS.

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:03.487
SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THE

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:05.823
COMMISSION IS NOT FOCUSING ON IT

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.992
GETS LESS ATTENTION AND I THINK

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:09.526
THAT THAT CREATES.

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.495
I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES LIKE IN THE

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:12.863
ELECTRIC SIDE THE GAS SIDE WHERE

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.098
I THINK THAT.

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:15.599
YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.835
PARTICULAR RULE OR SOME

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:20.137
REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT -- AND SO

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.472
THEN IT JUST DOESN'T GET THE

00:42:21.538 --> 00:42:25.042
ATTENTION IT DOESN'T GET THE THE

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:26.510
IT DOESN'T COME UP AS A PROGRAM

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:27.745
FOR THE UTILITY.

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:29.847
SO I THINK THAT WE DO PLAY AND

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:31.849
AND MAJOR PART IN TERMS OF

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:34.051
IDENTIFYING AND LOOKING OVER

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.419
WHAT DO YOU TELL THAT HE HAS AND

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:36.453
WHAT IT DOESN'T HAVE I THINK

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.589
IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT NEED THAT

00:42:38.656 --> 00:42:40.658
THE REGULATOR HAS TO PLAY.

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:51.035
ON AND ON ON THE I'M.

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.304
SO -- I AND I LOST THE OTHER

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.406
SIDE INSIDE BUT ANYWAY I DO

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:58.108
THINK THAT IT'S AT IT IS A VERY

00:42:58.175 --> 00:42:59.877
ALL IN IN IN TERMS OF ASSESSING

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:01.345
CITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.479
I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:03.681
OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOW THAT CAN

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.683
GO ABOUT HAPPEN IT CAN HAPPEN

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:07.451
FROM COMMISSION STAFF IT CAN

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.353
HAPPEN FROM THIRD PARTIES.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.622
IT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIRD -- FOR

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:13.457
INDUSTRY CREDIT PARTIES I I

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.092
DON'T SEE THAT ANY OF THEM HAS

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.527
TO BE EXCLUSIVE OF THE OTHER IN

00:43:16.593 --> 00:43:18.095
THE JAMES REASON MODEL OF THE

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:20.664
SWISS CHEESE YOU KNOW.

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:23.567
KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE IT MAY ISS

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.435
SOMETHING.

00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:27.104
AND SO I THINK THAT THE MORE

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.605
LAYERS THAT YOU HAVE.

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:30.374
THE MORE LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:35.446
PREVENT AN INCIDENT SO -- I DO

00:43:35.512 --> 00:43:38.215
THINK THAT -- TO THE TO THE

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:39.049
EXTENT WE CAN BE MORE BROAD

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.317
ABOUT -- ABOUT YOU KNOW LOOKING

00:43:40.384 --> 00:43:42.252
FOR WHAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT OUR OR

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:44.455
OUR BRING FORWARD I THINK THE

00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:47.124
FASTER WE'RE GOING. TO TO BRING

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.460
DOWN -- OR OR TO BE ABLE TO

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:52.796
REDUCE INCIDENTS THAT ARE THAT

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:56.033
WE NAY REDUCE ANYWAY.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:56.667
THAT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.035

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.203
FOR AND TESTIFIED THAT IS VERY

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:01.538
HELPFUL AND WE'RE LEARNING NOW

YOU KNOW APPROVED WE'VE LOOKED

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:02.232
AT THE AT THE ESSAYS WORK OVER

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.901
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AND WHILE

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:04.635
I THINK THEY'VE.

00:45:04.701 --> 00:45:06.236
BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL AND AND

00:45:06.303 --> 00:45:08.972
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT SAFETY AND AS

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.375
WE ARE TODAY I A WORRY.

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:12.910
I STILL WORRY THAT THEY'VE BEEN

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:14.812
STYMIED BY THE PROCESS IS THE

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:16.680
CPUC IN THE CHALLENGES THERE IS

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.248
ONE OF THE NEWEST OFFICES.

00:45:18.315 --> 00:45:20.150
AT THE CPUC THEY PROVIDE A GOOD

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.453
TEST FOR MEASURING THIS THIS

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.854
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I THINK THE

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.122
QUESTION IS DOES THE RATE CASE

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.857
MENTALITY AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:27.758
BEFORE.

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:30.561
AS THE RATE CASE MENTALITY THE

00:45:30.627 --> 00:45:32.029
CPUC DOES IT BLEED OVER TO ALL

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:34.331
ASPECTS OF ITS GOVERNANCE IN

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:36.200
SUCH A WAY THAT SAFETY IS IS

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:37.768
MARGINALIZED IS GONNA PUT TO THE

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:38.635
SIDE.

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:39.770
OF THOSE RATE CASES THE

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:43.073
GOVERNOR'S CLOAK CLEARLY STATED.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.308
IS CLOSE CLEARLY STATED REFORM

00:45:44.374 --> 00:45:46.977
OF THE CPUC NEEDS TO OCCUR AND

00:45:47.044 --> 00:45:48.412
BUT WHAT REFORM IS NECESSARY.

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:50.080
ESPECIALLY BEYOND THE REFORM

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:51.815
THAT HAS ALREADY OCCURRED WE'VE

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:53.317
DONE THINGS OVER THE LAST TEN

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.986
YEARS -- AND MADE SOME CHANGES

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:58.322
BUT KNOW WHAT OTHER REFORMS ARE

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:00.157
NECESSARY WITHIN THE CPC MANY

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.725
YEARS AGO I CONSIDERED.

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.293
WE THOUGHT ABOUT REMOVING THE

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.195
SAFETY FROM THE CPUC AND THAT

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.064
HAS BEEN A CONVERSATION AND WE

00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:09.733
SET SET ASIDE THAT IDEA BECAUSE

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.168
I DON'T THINK WE WERE CONVINCED

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.703
THAT A NEW ENTITY WOULD BE TAKEN

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:13.670
SERIOUSLY.

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:15.439
OR LEAD TO BETTER SAFETY

00:46:15.506 --> 00:46:22.913
OUTCOMES -- I I'M NOW KIND OF

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.114
QUESTIONING THAT CONCLUSION.

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.682
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER

00:46:25.749 --> 00:46:26.650
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND I

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:27.784
OF OF SO I'M APPRECIATE YOUR

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:28.385
COMING TODAY TO MAYBE WE COULD

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:29.052
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION A LITTLE

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.554
BIT TO SEE IF WE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.990
OR IF THE MODEL OF HAVING SAFETY

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.825
WITHIN THOSE RATE CASES WITHIN

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:35.926
THE P. YOU SEE.

00:46:35.993 --> 00:46:38.262
A IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT HAS

00:46:38.328 --> 00:46:39.796
WORKED SO WE IT TO PROFESSOR

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:41.131
SHOWMAN AND AND ROBERT YOU'VE

BECAUSE I VIEW THEM.

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:28.812
NO THERE REALLY AN IMPORTANT

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:30.514
PLAYER IN THIS DIALOGUE THAT WE

00:47:30.581 --> 00:47:31.915
HAVE OF HOW SAFETY MANAGEMENT

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:33.483
SYSTEMS WORK AND HOW THEY COME

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:34.384
TOGETHER.

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:35.919
AND HOW THE REGULATED BUT ONE OF

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:36.753
THE THEMES FROM THE SAFETY

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.322
LITERATURE IS NEEDING TO HAVE

00:47:38.388 --> 00:47:40.557
CLEAR LINES OF COMMUNICATION.

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:42.826
AND TRUST BETWEEN THE REGULATED

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:45.429
ENTITIES AND THE REGULATORS WE

WERE HOPING THAT US THE GENIE.

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.198
COULD HIGHLIGHT INSTANCES OF

00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:49.666
WHERE THE CPUC HAS BEEN

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.401
SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING THESE

00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:53.170
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION OR IF

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:54.438
THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:54.838
SUCCESSFUL.

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.607
WITHIN WITH INVITED THE OTHER

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.308
UTILITIES AS WELL BUT OF THE

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.344
UTILITIES WE SPOKE WITH -- WERE

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.813
TROUBLES AT HAVING A PUBLIC

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.514
DIALOGUE IN THE FILTER THAT

00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:06.083
WOULD NOT BE WELL RECEIVED BY

00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:07.284
THE REGULATOR IF THEY WERE

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.119
SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT THAT

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:10.287
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:11.955
BECAUSE THAT'S THE EXACT ISSUE

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:13.857
WE RAISE IN THE BACKGROUND

00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:14.958
REPORT THAT THERE.

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:16.860

REGULATE THE UTILITIES AND

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.708
THAT'S THAT ADVERSARIAL

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:32.476
RELATIONSHIPS OR ARE SO INDEBTED

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:33.410
THAT EVEN CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:33.977
CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED AND

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:34.778
THAT'S WHAT WE SEE TODAY AND

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:36.847
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE EMPTY

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.582
CHAIR SIT IN THERE TODAY SO I

IT REALLY HAS THE CHANGE QUITE

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:24.328
DRAMATICALLY IN MANY WAYS.

L. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOME.

00:49:29.499 --> 00:49:32.903
EIGHT THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:37.174
RESULTS IN THE IN THE INDUSTRY.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.242
AND THE CHALLENGES THE WE'RE

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.644
CONTINUING TO HEALTH IN THE

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:41.712
STATE'S [inaudible]

EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S

NOT.

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.384

ONE PACK THIS.

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.594
AS TO WHY [inaudible]

HELLO.

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:01.732
YOU DO ONE THING THAT I THINK IS

00:50:01.798 --> 00:50:03.433
IMPORTANT.

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.769
TO REMEMBER ABOUT THESE SYSTEMS.

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.472
IS THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:11.375
FOR ANY CHANGE TO REALLY HOW

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.810
IMPACT IN THE FIELD AND THAT'S

00:50:13.877 --> 00:50:14.444
ONE THING THAT I THINK IS VERY

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:15.879
DIFFERENCE.

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:16.913
FROM.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.014
EITHER BETWEEN UTILITY

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:19.282
OPERATIONS AND LET'S SAY EVEN

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.984
LIKE AIRLINE INDUSTRY RIGHT IS

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.152
JUST AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:24.254
THAT WE HEALTH.

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:27.324
IN THE FIELD AND HOME THE FACT

00:50:27.391 --> 00:50:29.459
THAT A LOT OF RESULTS THAT WE

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:33.330
SEE THE RESULTS OF THE STORMS

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.532
THAT ARE IN PLACE.

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:38.268
ELEMENT AND THEY TAKE A LONG

00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:41.338
TIME. TO SHIFT.

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:42.739
THROUGH THROUGH THE YOU KNOW YOU

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.174
KIND OF OPERATING ON THESE TEN

00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:44.508
YEAR CYCLES.

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:46.376
OF IN SOME CASES EVEN MORE WHEN

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:47.644
YOU ACTUALLY CAN SEE THE

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:50.580
SYSTEMIC RESULTS I THINK THAT'S

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.182
ONE OF THE REALLY BIG CHALLENGES.

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:55.218
THAT WE HELD AS WE TRY.

00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:58.588

00:50:58.655 --> 00:51:01.558
PARADIGM IN CALIFORNIA.

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:02.459
IS.

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:04.394
THAT WE TEND TO JUDGE

00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:07.731
PERFORMANCE ON THE VERY SPEED

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:09.032
YOU THOUGH IMMEDIATE SORT OF

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:24.881
IS SUCH A BIG OUT TIME LAG.

00:51:24.948 --> 00:51:27.484

TO PERHAPS HELP YOUR

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.300
DELIBERATIONS IS WE WOULD LOOK

00:53:57.367 --> 00:53:59.102
BACK OVER.

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.971
OUR EXPERIENCE IN LOOKING AT

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.672
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD TO MANAGE

00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:04.474
HAVE HAD TO MANAGE THE HAZARDOUS

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:05.542
TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND HAVE DONE

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:07.243
SO SUCCESSFULLY IN.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:08.612
THOSE THAT HAVEN'T.

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:10.080
AND TRY TO DISTILL WHAT WE THINK

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.648
ARE SOME OF FOUNDATIONAL

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.416
FUNCTIONS.

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:14.584
THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:16.319
NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE SAFETY

00:54:16.386 --> 00:54:17.854
REGULATIONS.

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:18.822
I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW

00:54:18.888 --> 00:54:20.423
OF THEM.

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:25.428
AND USE THESE AS IN A SENSE

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.563
STARTING POINTS FOR A

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.231
CONVERSATION ABOUT OPTIONS.

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:30.667
THE FIRST ONE THAT WE FIND IS

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.502
REALLY IMPORTANT IS BELIEVE IT

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.771
OR NOT ASKING QUESTIONS.

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:37.807
AFTER THE DEEPWATER HORIZON --

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:40.877
ACCIDENT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO --

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:41.511
INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE WAS SET

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:48.652
UP HE TOOK HOLD OF THE SAFETY

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:50.453
HANDBOOK FOR THE DEEPWATER

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.888
HORIZON RIG WHICH WAS A MASSIVE

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.023
THING READ THROUGH WOOD COVER TO

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:54.591
COVER.

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:57.427
AND AT THE END OF IT HE SAID.

00:54:57.494 --> 00:54:58.928
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S BAD

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:02.399
ENOUGH TO HAVE TO ACT FAST?

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:03.333
THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO THAT

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.068
QUESTION IN THE HANDBOOK AND IN

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.436
FACT IT TURNED OUT THAT ACCIDENT

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:07.737
TURNED AROUND PEOPLE NOT

00:55:07.804 --> 00:55:09.906
REALIZING WHEN IT WAS BAD ENOUGH

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.274
TO HAVE TO ACCESS.

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:12.876
SO SOMETIMES ASKING KEY

00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:14.577
QUESTIONS EVEN IF EMBARRASSING I

00:55:14.644 --> 00:55:16.079
REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOKED

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.014
AT THESE -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:20.517
MANAGE THEIR SYSTEM PRETTY WELL

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:21.685
DOWN TO THE CONTROL ROOM FOR

00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:23.253
EXAMPLE PEOPLE PLAY THE WHAT IF

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.287
GAME.

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:25.822
AND THEY WOULD STAND RUNS AROUND

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.991
AND SEE WHAT WE LOST POWER RIGHT

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:28.625
NOW WHEN THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:29.759
BUT WE DO.

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.728
AND THAT WHAT IF GAME WAS PLAYED

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.496
CONTINUALLY.

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:35.965
AND THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ASKING

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:36.533
THEMSELVES AND WORK PLANNING

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:37.467
SESSIONS.

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:38.935
HAVE WE MISSED ANYTHING IN THIS

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:41.071
PLAN WHAT IF THIS ASSUMPTION

00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:42.806
TURNS OUT TO BE WRONG.

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:43.606
AND THERE'S A CONSTANT

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:44.641
QUESTIONING IN THESE

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:46.076
ORGANIZATIONS -- AND THE

00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:47.444
QUESTION OF THE QUESTIONS IS

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:49.145
REALLY IMPORTANT DOESN'T MEAN

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.480
THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:51.781
RIGHT AWAY THE PERSON WHO ASKS.

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.383
BUT ASKING IT IS REALLY

00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:55.251
SIGNIFICANT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY

00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:56.886
ARE REALLY AFRAID OF MAKING

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:58.021
ERRORS.

00:55:58.088 --> 00:56:02.525
ERRORS IN THE CALCULATION IN THE

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:04.160
ANTICIPATION IN THE

00:56:04.227 --> 00:56:05.462
UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS.

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:07.731
AND ASKING QUESTIONS AS A WAY IN

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:09.532
WHICH THEY CAN SEE WHERE THE

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:10.900
UNCERTAINTIES LIE IN THEIR

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.235
OPERATIONS.

00:56:12.302 --> 00:56:13.503
SO THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.405
FUNCTION IN A SAFETY REGULATORY

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:16.639
REGIME.

00:56:16.706 --> 00:56:19.242
IT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED IN MANY

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:21.144
PLACES I'M THINKING THAT THIS IS

00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:22.345
ALSO A FUNCTION THAT YOU'RE

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.513
SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:25.348
CAN VERY PRODUCTIVELY ASK OF

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.784
PEOPLE WHO TESTIFY FROM THE

00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:29.853
COMMITTEES FROM THE COMMISSION

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.421
AND FROM THE UTILITIES.

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:33.757
WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IN THE

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:36.693
OFFICE OF THE SAFETY ADVOCATE?

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:37.227
IS IT THIS IS KIND OF A

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:39.262
DIFFICULT THING FOR THEM TO DO

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.364
SIMPLY ASK QUESTIONSAND PART OF

00:56:41.431 --> 00:56:43.433
IT IS BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT SEEMS

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.701
TO US.

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:45.368
THEY HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:46.336
SOMETHING.

00:56:46.402 --> 00:56:48.204
THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN ACTUAL

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:48.972
PROPOSITION.

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:52.108
AND IN A SENSE IF THEY ARE

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:54.911
ASKING A QUESTION THEY SHOULD BE

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.479
PROVIDING AN ANSWER.

00:56:56.546 --> 00:57:01.217
AND THIS IS OUR UNDERSTANDABLE

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:02.352
IN A SENSE BECAUSE THE NEW

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:03.620
ORGANIZATION AND THEY'RE WORRIED

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:06.422
ABOUT THE A STANDING THEY HAVE

00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.057
IN THE REST OF THE UP YOU SEE

00:57:08.124 --> 00:57:09.659
AND I JUST WANTED.

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:11.294
USE THIS FOR THE MOMENT TO SAY

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:13.363
THAT FROM OUR STANDPOINT.

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.831
IT HAS BEEN A VERY ROCKY

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:17.000
INTRODUCTION FOR THE OS EIGHT

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:20.870
INTO THE CPUC -- THEY ARE.

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:22.872
THEY HAVE BEEN STUCK INTO AN

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:25.441
ORGANIZATION THAT HAS MANY OTHER

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.010
COMPETING MISSIONS THE SAFETY.

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:27.877
THAT HAS MANY OTHER

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:30.013
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONSIDER

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:31.648
SAFETY PART OF WHAT THEY DO.

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.716
AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNDERSTAFFED

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:36.186
CERTAINLY IN STAFF BUT ALSO IN

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.020
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT AS HAS

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.755
BEEN MENTIONED.

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:41.491
AND THE CPUC ITSELF HAS NEVER

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:42.992
BEEN PROPERLY [inaudible]

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:45.762
INTRODUCED. TO THE FUNCTIONS THE

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.163
FULL RANGE OF FUNCTIONS THAT

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.065
NEED TO BE DONE BY AN OFFICE OF

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.900
THE SAFETY ADVOCATE QUESTION

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.468
ASKING IS ONE OF THEM.

00:57:52.535 --> 00:57:53.036
THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:54.103
ANSWERS.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.605
THEY CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.140
PROCEEDING AND FORCE OTHER

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:58.474
PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT ANSWERS

00:57:58.541 --> 00:58:00.710
AND THAT IS APPROPRIATE SAFETY

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:02.278
ADVOCACY AS WELL.

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:04.280
WHAT THE CPC SHOULD HAVE DONE IT

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.015
SEEMS TO ME IS? TO HAVE HAD A

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:09.285
FORMAL INTRODUCTION OF THAT ROLE

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:10.019
FOR THAT THE ROLES FOR THAT

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:12.789
OFFICE SOCIALIZE THE REST OF THE

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:15.458
COMMISSION. TO ACCEPTING THEM

00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:17.093
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE JUST

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.462
ANOTHER DIVISION SAFETY SHOULD

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:21.197
BE A PREEMINENT ISSUE FOR THE

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:22.866
CPUC.

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.634
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETE.

00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:26.970
FOR AGENDA SPACE WITH OTHER --

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:29.973
DIVISIONS AND OTHER UNITS.

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:33.176
AND SO ON OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:34.677
NOT TOO LATE BY THE WAY FOR THE

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:36.279
SI PC TO DO A BETTER

00:58:36.346 --> 00:58:38.114
INTRODUCTION.

00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:39.449
IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:40.550
ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SAFETY

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.785
ADVOCACY FUNCTIONS AND WHAT'S

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.754
REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE SAFETY

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:46.222
REGULATION.

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:49.259
WITHIN THE WHOLE COMMISSION --

00:58:49.325 --> 00:58:51.961
SO THAT'S ONE ONE ISSUE A SECOND

00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:54.397
FOUNDATION FUNCTION IS RESEARCH

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:56.132
AND ANALYSIS.

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.001
THE BEST SAFETY.

00:58:58.067 --> 00:58:59.702
REGULATORY REGIMES THOSE

00:58:59.769 --> 00:59:01.404
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FAA IN

00:59:01.471 --> 00:59:02.639
THE NRC.

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:03.773
THEY DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH A LOT

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.275
OF IT THEY GIVE GRANTS FOR

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:07.443
RESEARCH THEY HAVE PEOPLE AROUND

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.945
WHO ARE EXPERTS.

00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:11.114
IN THAT PROCESS OF RESEARCH IS

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.217
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR NOT JUST.

00:59:14.284 --> 00:59:15.485
KNOWING.

00:59:15.551 --> 00:59:17.153
WHAT ISSUES ARE GOING TO

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:18.521
CONFRONT THEM THE RESEARCH GIVES

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:20.623
THEM A FORWARD LOOKING LOOK AT

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.790
THE?

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.325
STATE OF REACTIVE LOOK.

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.961
ON BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:27.563
THEM TO ACTUALLY DO.

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.132
AND MAKE REGULATORY DECISIONS

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:31.067
RIGHT NOW THE CPUC IS

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:32.302
CONSIDERING IN ONE OF ITS MAJOR

00:59:32.368 --> 00:59:34.404
PROCEEDINGS.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.872
OPTIONS FOR RESTRUCTURING P.

00:59:35.939 --> 00:59:37.974
JEANNIE WITH RESPECT TO

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:39.475
PROMOTING ITS SAFETY CULTURE.

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:40.543
THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:41.945
QUESTION WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:43.546
HOW TO GROW SAFETY CULTURE IN AN

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:45.148
ORGANIZATION [inaudible]

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:46.950
CONCLUSIVELY SYSTEMATICALLY

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:49.752
THEY'RE ASKING THAT QUESTION SO --

00:59:49.819 --> 00:59:51.988
BASICALLY WHATEVER THEY DECIDE

00:59:52.055 --> 00:59:53.556
IN TERMS OF RESTRUCTURING.

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:55.024
IS GOING TO BE ON ON CERTAIN

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.159
PROPOSITION.

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.393
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.594
VERY CAREFULLY.

00:59:58.661 --> 01:00:00.296
THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHATEVER THEY

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:02.732
DECIDE IN P. JEANNIE THEY'RE

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:03.933
GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.234
GOOD INSPECTIONS BUT THEY'RE

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:06.336
GOING TO HAVE MET THEY NEED THEY

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:07.704
NEED METRICS.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.673
RIGHT NOW THE P. YOU SEE HAS NO.

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:12.008
SAFETY METRICS.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.276
THEY DON'T REGULATE FOR SAFETY

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.144
MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE NO

01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:17.246
ORGANIZATIONAL METRICS FOR

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.715
SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR FOR

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.149
SAFETY CULTURE.

01:00:20.216 --> 01:00:21.884
PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THEY

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.820
DON'T DO A LOT OF RESEARCH.

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.455
AND BY NOT DOING THAT RESEARCH

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:26.155
IT SEEMS TO US.

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:29.158
THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN A VERY

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.694
DIFFICULT POSITION RELATIVE TO

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.763
DECISION MAKING AND FOLLOWING

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.198
THROUGH ON WHAT THEY DECIDE TO

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:35.765
DO.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.368
SO OUR VIEW IS THAT RESEARCH IS

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:41.270
REALLY IMPORTANT -- THE ESSAY IN

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:43.172
OUR REGIONAL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.540
COULD BE WOULD HAVE BEEN --

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:45.842
SAFETY ANALYSIS THE OFFICER

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:47.443
SAFETY ANALYSIS AND WOULD HAVE

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:48.511
HAD.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:52.115
SAFETY EXPERTS WITH ON ON STAFF.

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.816
TO ACTUALLY DO FOR LOOKING

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.118
RESEARCH.

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.352
THIS IS WERE POSSIBLY

01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.388
INDEPENDENT SAFETY REGULAR AN

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.356
INDEPENDENT UTILI SAFETY BOARD

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.458
COULD BE HELPFUL WITH EXPERTS

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.494
WHO WOULD ACTUALLY DO RESEARCH

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:08.164
USEFUL FOR THE PC -- SO.

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.199
IN THAT SENSE THAT'S A FUNCTION

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:11.768
THAT NEEDS TO BE TENDED TO AND

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.436
UNLIKE MANY OTHER SAFETY

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:15.004
REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS.

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:18.474
IN OUR VIEW THE CPUC IS VERY.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.576
UNDER OF ORGANIZED FROM THE

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:22.178
STANDPOINT OF DOING SAFETY

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.180
RESEARCH.

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:26.516
A THIRD ISSUE IS ACCIDENT AND

01:01:26.582 --> 01:01:27.984
INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IS REALLY

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:29.452
IMPORTANT FUNCTION FOR ALL

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.620
SAFETY REGULATORY.

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.755
ORGANIZATIONS -- SOME USE

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.557
EXTERNAL USES THE EXTERNAL

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.592
ORGANIZATION THE FAA USES THE

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.528
NTSB.

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:41.230
AND ACTUALLY -- THE CPUC AFTER

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:44.534
THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION HAD

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.001
CREATED AN INDEPENDENT

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:47.336
DISTILLERY INVESTIGATORY PANEL

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.172
THAT REALLY DID A REALLY NICE.

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:51.607
REVIEW -- BUT A LOT OF THE

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.242
INCIDENT AN ACCIDENT

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:55.178
INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE BY IN

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:55.878
HOUSE.

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:58.147
CPUC PEOPLE THERE'S NOTHING

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.816
WRONG WITH THAT THEY ARE --

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.918
DIRECTED MOST OF THEM BY

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.653
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES.

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.555
FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING THOSE ALE

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.657
JAY'S HAVE NO TRAINING IN ROOT

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:08.991
CAUSE ANALYSIS.

01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.993
NO TRAINING SAFETY MANAGEMENT NO

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.628
TRAINING SAFETY CULTURE.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.797
SO PART OF THIS IS AGAIN WHAT DO

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.065
THEY KNOW THE RIGHT TO WRITE THE

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.533
TO ENHANCE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.969
FROM THAT WE THINK THAT THAT

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:21.437
PROCESS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:02:21.504 --> 01:02:25.308
UPGRADED -- ANOTHER FUNCTION

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:29.011
INSPECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT --

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.581
THIS IS WHERE I THINK.

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.749
A LOT OF ADVANCE AND UPGRADING

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.885
REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.086
THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.355
COMMISSION HAS TWO FULL TIME

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.724
RESIDENT INSPECTORS ON EVERY

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.793
PLANE AT EVERY PLANT IT OPERATE

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.561
IT IT OVERSEAS AND ALL OF THE

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.296
FUEL PROCESSING PLANTS THEY ARE

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:48.431
THERE FULL TIME.

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:50.266
THEY CAN GO TO ANY MEETING THEY

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.301
WISH.

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:53.703
TO THE P. YOU SEE HAS.

01:02:53.769 --> 01:02:56.739
SOME CERTAINLY HAS SOME --

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.975
INSPECTORS BUT THEY PERIODICALLY

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.511
VISIT IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP TRACK

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.679
OF THE LARGE UTILITY BUT THEY

01:03:03.746 --> 01:03:05.414
ONLY MAKE PERIODIC VISITS.

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:10.052
AND THEY HAVE ARE.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.888
REALLY NO TRAINING IN THE WHAT

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:13.156
TO LOOK FOR FROM THE STANDPOINT

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.690
OF SAFETY MANAGEMENT OR SAFETY

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:16.292
CULTURE WHEN THEY GO TO DO THAN

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.660
INSPECTIONS.

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.763
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A HIGHLY

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.366
TRAINED AND PROFESSIONAL LIES.

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.368
INSPECTION STAFF COULD ENERGIZE

01:03:25.434 --> 01:03:26.802
THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:27.870
REGULATORY APPROACH OF THE

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.705
ENTIRE AGENCY AND THAT'S

01:03:29.772 --> 01:03:31.507
SOMETHING TO TO REALLY CONSIDER.

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.408
ONE OF THE THINGS IN OUR VIEW

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.011
THAT CAUSES SOME PROBLEMS IS

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:35.311
[inaudible]

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:39.882
A WE SAW THIS IN OUR VISIT IN

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:41.617
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A A AN

01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:44.720
UNUSUAL -- DIVISION THAT IS NOT

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:46.455
EVEN EQUALLY UNDERSTOOD BY

01:03:46.522 --> 01:03:48.558
EVERYBODYBETWEEN ADVICE AND

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.826
ADVOCACY AND BETWEEN POLICY AND

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:53.329
ENFORCEMENT.

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.998
SUBTOTAL OF THESE DIVISIONS.

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.433
MAKE MOST INSPECTORS THAT WE

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.734
TALKED TO BELIEVE IT'S NOT THEIR

01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:02.872
ROLE. TO GIVE ADVICE ON POLICY.

01:04:02.939 --> 01:04:05.841
AND IT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE IT'S

01:04:05.908 --> 01:04:09.245
NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ENFORCERS.

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:10.746
TO MAKE THE LAWS THAT THEY IN

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:11.814
FORCE.

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:13.983
WELL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.352
BELIEVE IS REALLY USEFUL AND IN

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.721
FACT BY DOING THAT.

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:20.423
THEY DENY POLICY THE PEOPLE AT

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.058
THE POLICY LEVEL A LOT OF

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:23.259
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEIR

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.327
SEED.

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:26.529
IN THESE UTILITIES.

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:28.998
AND WHAT REGULATIONS ARE WORKING

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.499
WELL FROM THEIR STANDPOINT

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:31.667
ENTERS A COMPLIANCE

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.436
INEFFECTIVENESS AND WHICH ONES.

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.670
ARE NOT AND WHAT GAPS THERE

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:36.005
CURRENTLY ARE THAT IS REALLY

01:04:36.072 --> 01:04:37.373
USEFUL INFORMATION.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.041
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE

01:04:39.108 --> 01:04:41.143
INSPECTOR FORCE BECOME IT'S OWN

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.012
PROFESSIONAL GROUP.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.380
AND BUILD ITS OWN.

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:46.782
ESPRIT AND BE A REALLY POSITIVE

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.951
FORCE FOR THE UPGRADING OF THAT

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.053
INSPECTION ROLE WITHIN THE

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.855
UTILITY.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.523
MONITORING SAFETY DRAFT.

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:56.459
THE FACT IS SAFETY IS NOT A

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:57.827
BUILDING YOU BUILDING IT'S ONCE

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.362
AND FOR ALL IT'S A CONSTANT

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:01.330
PROCESS THAT DEGRADES AND HAS TO

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.832
BE RESTORED.

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:03.966
WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT WHAT WE

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.034
CALL HIGH RELIABILITY

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:07.670
ORGANIZATIONS WHAT WE SEE IS NOT

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:08.804
VARIANCE?

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.306
WHAT WE SEE IS THE FLUCTUATION

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:11.841
IN REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:13.309
ATTENTION THAT PEOPLE PAY

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.645
COMMUNICATION PROCESSES THAT

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:19.215
OCCUR AND DON'T OCCUR -- TRUST

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.950
BETWEEN THE UNITS.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.785
THAT THE CASE AND THEY

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:25.087
CONSTANTLY HAVE TO MANAGE THESE

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.256
THEY LOOK FOR SIGNALS OF DECAY.

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.258
AND THEY BASICALLY DO WHAT THEY

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:32.361
CAN TO RENEW THE FERVOR AS ONE

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:33.663
PERSON PUT IT TO ME IN A NUCLEAR

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:34.597
POWER PLANT.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.365
SO THEY MANAGED FLUCTUATIONS OF

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.302
THE AMPLITUDE IS NOT TOO GREAT.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.170
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE -- OF

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.973
THAT MONITORING OF SAFETY DRIFT

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.776
CAN ALSO BE DONE IN A UTILITY.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.177
I MEAN IN A REGULATOR.

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:50.112
YOU SEE HAS SO MANY POLICIES

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:51.480
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEALING WITH

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:54.984
SIMULTANEOUSLY RENEWABLE FUELS

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.585
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:58.854
OUR GLOBAL WARMING IS NOW A BIG

01:05:58.921 --> 01:06:00.823
ISSUE APPARENTLY.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.292
RATE AFFORDABILITY AS WELL AS

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:05.127
NOW WORRYING ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.195
COLLAPSE.

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:08.331
OF A MONOPOLY UTILITY AND THE

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:09.932
LOSS OF SERVICE THAT COULD COME

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:10.966
FROM THAT.

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.568
THAT'S A LOT TO PUT ON PEOPLE'S

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:14.403
PLATES AND SO IT'S NOT

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.639
SURPRISING THAT THE ATTENTION

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.474
FOCUSED ON SAFETY COULD DRAFT

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:18.774
[inaudible]

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:20.076
MAINTAINING.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.377
READING WHAT WE CALL WEAK

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.945
SIGNALS OF THAT PROCESS

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.180
BEGINNING IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:25.481
THAT WE SEE.

01:06:25.548 --> 01:06:27.616
AS A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE FOR

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.352
THE OSL BUT THE I SAY IF IT

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.954
COULD BECOME INSTITUTIONALIZED.

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.322
SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE THE

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:34.890
SUPPORT.

01:06:34.957 --> 01:06:37.393
UP THE COURAGE.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.028
AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT.

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:40.830
ALSO THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER THING

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:42.064
THAT WE THINK WOULD BE REALLY

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.165
IMPORTANT.

01:06:43.232 --> 01:06:44.567
YOU COULD IMAGINE EXTERNAL

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:46.135
ORGANIZATION REVIEWING THIS BUT

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.336
THEY HAVE TO INTERFERE ALL THE

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:48.838
TIME AND IT WOULD NOT BE AS

01:06:48.904 --> 01:06:50.239
EFFECTIVE IT SEEMS TO US AS AN

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:53.242
IN HOUSE -- ONE BUT IT IS ALSO

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:56.545
AN AREA BY THE WAY WHERE THE

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:58.848
SUBCOMMITTEE COULD LOOK FOR

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:00.983
SIGNS AS WELL IN THEIR OVERSIGHT

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:03.252
ROLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOCUS

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:04.820
ON SAFETY HAS NOT DEGRADED.

01:07:04.887 --> 01:07:06.622
OVER TIME AND OVER ALL OF THE

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:08.324
STRESS AND THE OTHER FUNCTIONS

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:09.058
EXPERTS TO PERFORM [inaudible]

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:11.594
LASTLY.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.928
CONTINUOUS PRESSURE FOR

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.130
IMPROVEMENT CHRIS TALKED ABOUT

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.766
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING.

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.467
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAFETY

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.435
MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THERE

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.036
EFFECTIVE ARE WORRIED THAT IF

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:21.971
THEY DON'T CONSTANTLY IMPROVE

01:07:22.037 --> 01:07:23.906
THEY'RE GONNA GET WORSE.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.108
BECAUSE IT'S NOT A STEADY STATE.

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:27.843
COMPLACENCY WILL COME IN IF

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:28.944
YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY TRYING TO

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.079
GET BETTER.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:31.380
AND THAT PRESSURE FOR GETTING

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.915
BETTER CAN BE DISTRIBUTED ALL

01:07:32.982 --> 01:07:34.250
OVER THE PLACE.

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:35.584
IT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED DOWN AT

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.353
THE SHOP LEVEL IF PEOPLE SEE

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.888
BETTER PROCEDURES THAT COULD OR

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:40.556
PROCEDURES AND AREN'T WORKING

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.191
AND WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM.

01:07:42.258 --> 01:07:45.027
AND USE THAT INFORMATION PUSH.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:46.162
FOR IMPROVEMENT ONE OF THE BEST

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.264
NUCLEAR RUN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.165
WE SAW.

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:51.600
WAS REALLY INTERESTING THE SHOP

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:54.303
LEVEL PEOPLE OWN THE PROCEDURES

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.071
THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PROPOSED

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.573
NEW PROCEDURES REVISIONS AND

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.841
PROCEDURES AND CARRIED IT ALL

01:07:58.908 --> 01:07:59.875
THE WAY THROUGH.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:02.011
FORMAL PROCESS TO CHANGE THOSE

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:04.380
PROCEDURES THAT'S A KIND OF PUSH

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.482
AT THAT LEVEL BUT IT CAN OCCUR

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.350
EVERYWHERE THE OSA SHOULD BE

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.786
CONSTANTLY LOBBYING AND FEEL

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:12.988
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO IT. FOR

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.458
THE DEFECATION OF SAFETY

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.058
IMPROVEMENTS NOT JUST WAITING

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:16.859
FOR UP [inaudible]

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:19.962
A PROCEED.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.464
WHERE EVERYBODY'S IN A REACTIVE

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.765
MODE IN THEIR IN STATE

01:08:22.832 --> 01:08:24.433
ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BUT

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.869
ACTUALLY PRO SUSPECTED PRO?

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.270
IDENTIFYING THINGS AND PUSHING

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:30.139
HARD I KNOW CHRIS WOULD LOVE TO

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:32.308
DO THAT IF YOU HAD MORE STAFF

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:33.976
AND IF THEY WERE.

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:35.511
IF HIS PROPOSALS WERE

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.546
INSTITUTIONALIZED WITH RESPECT

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.215
TO THE SUPPORT THE OSA HAS TO

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:40.349
MAKE THEM.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:45.154
IN IN THE CPUC IN -- SO IN ANY

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:46.622
CASE THESE ARE THE KINDS OF

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:47.556
FUNCTIONS THAT WE THINK ARE

01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:49.024
NECESSARY.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:50.159
YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK THROUGH

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:52.061
CAREFULLY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.662
PLACED OR HOW TO PROMOTE THEM --

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:55.598
BUT I THINK IT'S AT A CRITICAL

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:58.234
TIME FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. FOR

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:00.069
ACTUALLY YOUR COMMITTEE TO

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:02.271
DECIDE OKAY WE'RE NOT I DON'T

01:09:02.338 --> 01:09:04.373
THINK EITHER CARLINA RIGHTS ARE

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:05.541
CONFIDENT.

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:09.078
THAT THE TRAJECTORY AHEAD IS ON

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:10.779
SOME SORT OF AUTOMATIC PILOT TO

01:09:10.846 --> 01:09:13.282
SAFETY WE DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL.

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:15.384
SO I THINK SOM MAJOR RETHINKING

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:16.519
IS REALLY IMPORTANT AT ALL

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:18.921
LEVELS AND IN ALL PLACES THANK

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:19.455
YOU.

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.323
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.059
DOCTOR ROBERTS WOULD GIVE SOME.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:26.695
CALLING.

01:09:26.762 --> 01:09:30.332
AFTER FROM THE OF SIR THANK YOU.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.467
I THINK DOCTOR ASSAULT SAID

01:09:31.534 --> 01:09:32.334
ABOUT THE BEST IT COULD BE SAID

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:32.968
I MEAN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.405
THESE ISSUES. FOR QUITE AWHILE

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:40.042
NOW -- I HAVE WORKED OF WITH --

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.877
ORGANIZATIONS TO DO QUITE WELL

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.345
IN FACT IT WOULD LET ME UNLESS

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.980
THEY DID QUITE WELL BECAUSE I

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:47.750
TALK TOO MUCH -- AND SO THAT

01:09:47.816 --> 01:09:48.918
THAT WERE DOING WELL I'D ALSO

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:51.787
SAY THAT BUT IN IN THAT IN THAT

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:56.458
INSTANCE YOU DO SEE -- HI TRUSTS

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.961
GOOD COMMUNICATION AND AND NOT

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.130
AN OVERLOAD IN FACT IF YOU HAVE

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:02.898
LOOKED AT THE NEWSPAPERS

01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:05.768
RECENTLY ABOUT SEVERAL US NAVY

01:10:05.834 --> 01:10:07.336
SHIPS THAT GOT INTO A LOT OF

01:10:07.403 --> 01:10:08.137
TROUBLE.

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:11.006
IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS SAID I I

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:13.542
DIDN'T LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY.

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:16.312
IT WAS SAID THAT PART OF WHAT

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:17.580
WAS LACK OF TRAINING.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:18.847
AND PART OF WHAT WAS OVERLOAD

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:20.783
THEY HAD TAKEN PEOPLE CREW OFF

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.084
THOSE SHIPS.

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.686
AND SO THEY HAD TOO MANY PEOPLE

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:26.522
DOING -- DOING THE JOBS THAT

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.457
MORE PEOPLE SHOULD OF DONE ON ON

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.426
THOSE SHIPS AND SO I THINK THAT

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:32.294
THE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:36.298
WITH -- CEBU SEE ARE ARE IN

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:39.234
GREAT PARK OVERLOAD.

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:41.036
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:42.905
DISTRIBUTED BUT YOU CAN'T

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.373
DISTRIBUTED WITH ALSO JUST

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.842
WITHOUT ALSO DISTRIBUTING.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:48.277
TRUST AND COMMUNICATION CAN'T BE

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.912
DONE.

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:51.947
THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL WHAT I

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.849
WANTED IT'S IT'S THANKS FOR THAT

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.084
PRESENTATION IT'S KIND OF KIND

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.652
OF SET THE TONE I THINK IN AND

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.621
REYES A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:00.756
AND AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THE

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:01.724
CAN I GUESS TO THE WHAT.

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.659
THE THREAT THRESHOLD QUESTION I

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.127
THINK THAT -- WE'RE INVOLVED

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:08.364
WITH INTER DURING THE JANUARY

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:08.964
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE HEARING WE

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:10.866
HAD IN SANTA ROSA -- IT

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.501
PRESIDENT PICKER NOTED AND I'LL

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:14.169
QUOTE WE THIS IF YOU SEE WERE

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:16.839
NOT DESIGNED TO BE SPEEDY WE

01:11:16.905 --> 01:11:18.140
WERE DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.074
DOWN.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:20.876
AND WE LITIGATE EVERYTHING JUST

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.378
AS IF WE WERE A COURT OF LAW

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.779
WHICH CAUSE.

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:24.647
TO PROMOTION BECAUSE COMMENTS

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.548
ABOUT HOW THINGS JUST GONNA TAKE

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.484
TEN YEARS -- OR SOMETIMES THINGS

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.387
MOVE KIND OF SLOWLY BECAUSE THE

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:34.256
PROCESSES ARE SLOW PROCESS EASY

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:35.958
EQUALLY QUESTIONS SAFETY

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:38.093
REGULATION RATE MAKING

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.528
REGULATION OF THE UTILITIES.

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:41.797
BEING HOUSED IN THE SAME AGENCY

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.666
SO SELECT ASK USED ALL OF YOUR

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:45.634
THOUGHTS ON THIS -- DO YOU

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:47.436
BELIEVE ONE ORGANIZATION SHOULD

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:49.738
BE BOTH THE RATE REGULATOR AND A

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:52.441
SAFETY REGULATOR OR OR DO THESE.

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:53.876
KIND OF GOT A RESULT IN

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.178
UNTENABLE CONFLICTS BECAUSE OF

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.714
THEIR INHERENT NATURE AND IF

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:03.585
IT'S DONE IN ONE ORGANIZATION.

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.220
IT'S AN UPHILL CLIMB TO PROTECT

01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:07.423
SAFETY.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.458
IN RELATIONSHIP TO A HUGE

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:11.460
CONCENTRATION ON RATES.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.362
BRINGING SAFETY INTO THE RATE

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:14.763
CASE.

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.265
IS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.766
BECAUSE SAFETY CAN'T BE MEASURED

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:20.135
IN THE SAME WAY THAT CAPACITY

01:12:20.202 --> 01:12:22.004
AND COSTS ARE.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:26.208
AND BECAUSE SAFETY.

01:12:26.275 --> 01:12:28.711
IN A SENSE IF YOU HAVE SAFETY

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:31.013
THEN YOU.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.980
IT'S HARD TO VALUE THINGS THAT

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.949
DON'T HAPPEN.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:35.584
AND SO IT'S HARD TO BUILD UP A

01:12:35.651 --> 01:12:38.053
HEAD OF STEAM TO RAISE RATES TO

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.421
IMPROVE SAFETY.

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:41.290
IF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S A

01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:44.827
CRISIS SITUATION AND THE OTHER

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:46.762
THING IS I'M AFRAID AND I HAVE

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:48.397
SEEN SOME EVIDENCE I WON'T SAY

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:49.732
WHERE.

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:51.600
OF UTILITY SIMPLY MANAGING THEIR

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.635
SAFETY TO THE RATE CASE.

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:54.203
IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:56.638
GOING TO GET.

01:12:56.705 --> 01:12:58.540
A COMPENSATION IN RATES THAT IS

01:12:58.607 --> 01:12:59.775
NOT A SAFE INVESTMENT THEY'RE

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.376
GOING TO MAKE.

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:03.746
AND PART OF THE ISSUE IS TO FIND

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.314
A WAY TO STIMULATE.

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.816
THE UTILITIES THEMSELVES TO

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.585
UNDERTAKE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS.

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:12.888
AND IF THE RATE CASE ISTHE WAY

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.323
THEY MANAGE SAFETY INVESTMENTS

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:16.625
THENSAFETY IT SEEMS TO ME IS

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:17.593
ALWAYS GOING TO BE [inaudible]

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:20.963
A UNDER APPRECIATED AND UNDER

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.731
DEFENDED.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:25.000
PROPERTY SO I THINK IT'S NOT

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.235
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S A VERY

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:27.603
UPHILL BATTLE IN WE CERTAINLY

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:28.971
SAW THAT WITH P. JEANNIE AFTER

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:30.439
THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION I MEAN

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:31.907
THEY CERTAINLY DID MAKE MAJOR

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.308
IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR GAS SYSTEM

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.510
I MEAN THEY WERE FORCED TO DO

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.745
THAT BY THE P. UC'S CERTAINLY.

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.280
AND BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO TO

01:13:38.347 --> 01:13:39.815
IMPROVE THAT BUT THEY TOTALLY

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.383
NEGLECTED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:44.019
HOUSE AND IN THAT'S WERE WERE

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:44.920
SHAPE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.321
THAT SAFETY IF THEY HAD THE

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.956
CULTURE AND IT HADN'T BEEN

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.124
INVOLVED IN RATE.

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.793
SINCE SOME FORM THEY WOULD HAVE

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.161
MADE THAT INVESTMENT OR FELT

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:53.128
THAT THEY COULD DO THAT AND

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:54.396
SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT SO.

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:55.864
I I THINK YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:13:55.931 --> 01:13:58.066
RIGHT IN THAT IT BUT I DON'T

01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.568
KNOW BUT PRETTY MUCH AND WE HAVE

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:01.537
A WE HAVE IT AT TWO EXAMPLES OF

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.705
WHERE IT OF IF YOU REALLY WANT.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:06.975
TO HAVE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:07.709
RATE SAFETY.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.412
COMBINATION DOESN'T WORK AND ONE

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.747
IS IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:13.348
WHERE YOU HAD MINERAL MANAGEMENT

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:15.050
SERVICES.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.519
DOING BOTH -- LOOKING AT SAFETY

01:14:17.586 --> 01:14:19.721
AND RATES AND EVERYTHING ELSE

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.023
AND THEN WE HAD THE P..

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.558
AND THOUGH IT KILLED A LOT OF

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:25.894
FISH AND SOME PEOPLE AND DID A

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.162
LOT OF DAMAGE.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:28.697
AND SO THE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:31.333
SERVICE WAS CLOSED DOWN AND THAT

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.168
THE FUNCTIONS WERE DIVIDED INTO

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.337
TWO AGENCIES ONE OF WHOSE NAME

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.339
I'VE FORGOTTEN BUT THE OTHERS

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.607
BSE EATING.

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:41.577
THE OTHER EXAMPLES FUKUSHIMA.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:46.949
WHERE YOU HAD -- OF INSTEAD OF

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:50.018
INCEST ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.587
HAVE THE PEOPLE WERE WHO HAD

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.254
WRITTEN CHARGE OF RATES AS

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.389
SAFETY ON THE REGULATORY SIDE

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:56.725
WE'RE CHANGING JOBS WITH PEOPLE

01:14:56.792 --> 01:14:59.561
IN THE IN THE UTILITY.

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:01.263
AND THAT CAN GET TO BE A REALLY

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:03.232
DANGEROUS SORT OF THING WEEK

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:04.099
WE'VE.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.634
HAD SOME EXAMPLES THAT HERE IN

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:07.169
THE UNITED STATES THAT THAT

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.404
TURNED INTO A REALLY BIG AXIS SO

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:10.973
IF YOU NEED EXAMPLES OF WHERE

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:12.674
THEY SHOULD BE.

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:15.244
INDEPENDENT OF ONE OF THE THAT

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:19.047
THAT'S AT LEAST [inaudible]

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:22.050
TWO SOME.

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:24.853
ULTIMATELY THINK THE ODDS THEY

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.823
CAN BOOK WORK BOTH WAYS.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.092
THERE ARE KNOWN.

01:15:30.158 --> 01:15:31.360
IS.

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:32.327
A WOMAN'S.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:35.330
OVER WHAT IT SEEKS TO HALL OF

01:15:35.397 --> 01:15:36.732
THE ECHO.

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.600
OF FUNCTIONAL SAFETY PARADIGM

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:39.835
AND THAT THE CURRENT TO GAPS IN

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.169
THAT THAN THOSE GAPS NEEDS TO BE

01:15:41.236 --> 01:15:42.304
RESOLVED.

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.739
AND THEY NEED TO BE RESOLVED

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:44.873
WITHIN THEIR WITHIN THE P. YOU

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.375
SEE OR THAT THEIR EXTERNAL TO

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:47.943
THE PC AND THE SOME PROS AND

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.578
CONS TO DOING IT DIFFERENT WAYS

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.080
BUT ELEMENT EACH YEAR TO THIS

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.483
QUESTION ALL OF THE P. YOU SEE

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:55.784
HOW BEING THESE COMPETING

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:56.818
PRIORITIES IN THIS.

01:15:56.885 --> 01:15:57.920
KIND OF INHERENT CONFLICT

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.522
BETWEEN RATE MAKING AND SAFETY

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:03.125
ELM YEAR THE UPSIDE OF HAVING A

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:04.326
SINGLE AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.194
IS REFLECTS THE REALITIES OF

01:16:06.261 --> 01:16:07.629
WHAT THE OPERATORS ARE DEALING

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:08.363
WITH.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.532
BECAUSE SAFETY IS NOT THE ONLY

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.501
GOAL OF THE UTILITY THEIR YOUTH

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:16.972
THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S HERE TO

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:17.973
SERVE A PURPOSE.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.174
AND WE PUT A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.776
WE MEETING COLLECTIVELY RATES AS

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:23.912
AS A L. AS SOCIETY IT RATE OF

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:25.414
WHAT WE ONCE.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.850
THE UTILITIES -- TOOL FOR FILL

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.086
RATES WE WE NEED THEM TO SERVE

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:33.255
AND PROVIDE POWER OF WILL

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.490
ELECTRIC WERE NATURAL GAS WE ARE

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:40.562
OR WARNING THEM TO MEET THE IN

01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:41.663
HOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:42.531
PROMOTES.

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:45.634
L. COULD CLAIM ITS IT CHANGE

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.669
CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ALL

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:51.473
GOALS AND RENEWABLES WE L. BUT

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:52.674
YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:53.875
LECTURE FLYING THE

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:55.944
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ALL OF

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:57.913
THESE GOALS ARE BEING SETS BY A

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.281
POLICY MAKERS.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:01.616
HOME AND THE U. S. AND WE HOW

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.485
WILL BE ASLI THE COST ASPECTS OF

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:04.386
THE EARTH.

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.388
THAT'S IS A REALITY ALL OF THE

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:09.057
ENERGY SECTOR AND YOU CAN LAW IT

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.892
LOOK AT SEE.

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:13.228
IN ISOLATION FROM EVERYTHING

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.097
ELSE BECAUSE THE OPERATORS

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:17.466
HEALTH TO MAKE EL ECONOMIC HELP

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:20.068
TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THING WORK

01:17:20.135 --> 01:17:22.871
AND WE NEED TO HEALTH POLICY --

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:27.242
THAT ALSO IS COHESIVE AND MAKES.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.778
SENSE AS IN ITS TOTALITY FROM

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:33.348
CLOTH TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.417
ALL THE WAY THROUGH SAFETY AND

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:38.220
IF WE AS REGULATORS CAN LIGHT

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:42.157
RECONCILE OF THOSE PRIORITIES.

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.658
HELP HOW DO WE EXPECT THE

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:46.028
OPERATORS TO RECONCILE THEM.

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:48.430
ALL MAKE IT THE YIELD AND THE

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:49.931
WAY YOU THINK THAT.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.700
ELEMENT THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:53.902
WE CAN JUST MOVE SAFETY OVER

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:56.671
INTO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THUS.

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.373
GET RID OF THOSE PROBLEM THAT

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.911
EXIST IN THE INDUSTRY IS A YOU

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.379
KNOW LOOKING FOR A SUITABLE

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.948
SHORT CUT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:09.084
BELIEVE EXISTS WE HOW OLD THE

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.519
YOU KNOW A BIG CHALLENGE.

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:18.126
L. IN IN THE IN THE IN THIS

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:19.728
INDUSTRY ELM.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.562
AND WHERE THE HELL ALL YOU

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:22.998
ACTUALLY YOU WILL MAKE ALL OF

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:23.899
THE WORK SO I THINK IN THAT

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:24.633
SENSE ACTUALLY THERE IS A

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:25.934
BENEFIT TO HAVING. TO CONTINUING

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:27.602
HELPING THIS FUNCTION WITHIN THE

01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:29.037
WITHIN THE COMMISSION THE SECOND

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.473
POINT THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.642
YOU DO THIS VERY THIS DIFFERENT

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:36.178
ELEMENTS. TO SAFETY FUNCTIONS

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:38.280
FROM E. L. FROM THE STATE'S AND

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.781
REGULATORY POINTS OF VIEW SO

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:42.017
THERE IS THE OUT THE POLICY

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:43.351
MAKING FUNCTION.

01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:44.786
RATE WHEN YOU SET REGULATIONS

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.154
AND TELL THE UTILITIES WHAT TO

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:49.825
DEAL -- THERE IS THE THE SAFETY

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.593
ASSURANCE.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.361
FUNCTION THERE'S DIDN'T FORCE

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:54.496
ONE FUNCTION THERE'S THE SAFETY

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.031
PROMOTION FUNCTION AND THEY'RE

01:18:56.098 --> 01:19:02.037
NOT ALL NECESSARILY THE SAME SO --

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.071
HOME [inaudible]

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:04.106
EITHER.

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:05.807
IT -- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:08.176
WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PC AND

01:19:08.243 --> 01:19:09.611
WHAT SHOULD BE DOING?

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:11.780
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:14.249
YOU'LL SOME SO YOU KNOW WE GET

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.717
WE CAN BREAK THAT THAT QUESTION

01:19:15.784 --> 01:19:16.985
UP A LITTLE BIT.

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:20.188
OHM'S SO SO.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.556
FOUR YEAR WIN IT SO DOES ONE

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.992
ASPECT TO DO WITH POLICY.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:26.561
L. UNIT ONE OF THE OTHER GAPS

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.863
THAT YOU KNOW THAT USES AN

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:31.233
EXAMPLE IS IN THE HOME IS IT IN

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.434
THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND KIND OF

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.236
INSPECTION THAT WAS NEVER THE

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:36.338
FUNCTION OF THE PC IN THE

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:38.473
ELECTRIC SPACE WERE NEVER STAFF

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.509
DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY BE GOING.

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.644
OUT THERE AND INSPECTING

01:19:42.711 --> 01:19:45.447
INFRASTRUCTURE AT SCALE.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:48.216
HOME ALL WERE FIFTY FUNCTION AT

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.185
THE COMMISSION IS BASED ON THE

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:51.453
INVESTIGATION OF INCIDENTS AND

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.221
OUGHT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.389
FUNCTION FOR BOOTS ON THE GROUND

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.158
KIND OF INSPECTION.

01:19:56.224 --> 01:20:01.463
THE RIGHT NOW IT'S A GAP WE

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.131
PERFORM THIS SO.

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.266
THE BOOK MORE OF THAT ACTUAL

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:05.500
PHYSICAL INSPECTION.

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:07.035
ELEMENT THE WORK ON THE REAL

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:08.069
SIDE WHERE WE HOME INSPECTOR

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.371
SEXUALLY WALK TRACK.

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:11.706
ULTIMATE I DID SOME CALCULATIONS

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.375
SORT OF BACK OF THE ENVELOPE OF

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.210
WHAT KIND OF STAFFING WE WOULD

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:18.046
NEED ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE TO DO.

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:19.581
THE SAME KIND OF HAVE THE SAME

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.150
RATIO OF INSPECTORS.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.719
ELEMENTS WHO INFRASTRUCTURE IS

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:26.021
WE DO ON RAIL SO.

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:27.923
WHAT WE DO ON RAILS ABOUT FORTY

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.591
PEOPLE JUST YOU KNOW JUST

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.660
THINKING MILES IT WOULD SEEK

01:20:31.726 --> 01:20:34.396
WERE ABOUT?

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:38.166
FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF PEOPLE. TO DO

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.467
THE SAME LEVEL OF INSPECTIONS ON

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.203
THE ELECTRIC SIDE RATE SO WE'RE

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:44.005
ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE AGENCY

01:20:44.072 --> 01:20:47.375
THAT IS SET UP TO DO POLICY.

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:49.811
IF WE WERE TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER

01:20:49.878 --> 01:20:51.746
THOUSAND THEN THE HEALTH PEOPLE

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:54.282
TO DO -- FIELD INSPECTION THAT

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.451
CHANGES FUNDAMENTALLY THE TYPE

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.353
OF AN AGENCY THAT WE ARE SO I

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.722
THINK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING IF THE

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:01.957
STATE WANTS.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.391
TO CLOSE THIS GAP DOESN'T

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.393
DIFFERENT OPTIONS RATE WE CAN

01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.495
HIRE YOU KNOW IN ADDITIONAL

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.530
THOUSAND OR SO PEOPLE OF THE P.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:09.664
YOU SEE AND TRAIN THEM ON HOW

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.132
THAT AND HOUSE INSPECTION SOUTH

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.067
WE COULD.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.802
DO THIS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:14.836
CONTRACT.

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:17.072
RATE THAN INDEPENDENT EVALUATORS

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.573
OR WEAKENED HOUSE OF ONE ANOTHER

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.644
AGENCY LIKE HELL FIRE RATE THAT --

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:26.748
YOU KNOW MAYBE IS BETTER AND UP-TO HAVING A LARGE WORK FORCE.

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.683
WELL YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:29.985
THAT ALL -- AND LEAVE IT YOU

01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:31.653
KNOW OPEN FOR QUESTIONS BUT I

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.754
JUST WANT TO SAY ONE MORE THING

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:37.025
ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.260
QUESTION OF CREATING

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:38.560
[inaudible]

01:21:38.627 --> 01:21:39.561
ANOTHER AGENCY [inaudible]

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.963
HOME. EIGHT A SINGLE TIMIDLY CAN

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.964
WORK BOTH WAYS LIKE I SAID LIKE

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.699
IF YOU WANTED TO PULL THE SAFETY

01:21:44.766 --> 01:21:46.368
FUNCTION YOU EITHER IN THIS

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.002
ENTIRE DAY OR A PIECE OF IT OUT

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.270
OF THE P. YOU SEE AND CREATE

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:50.205
ANOTHER AGENCY I THINK IT CAN

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:50.839
WORK.

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:53.875
BUT IT IS YOU KNOW IT'S SIX TIME

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:56.244
IT'S SIX RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:58.013
TO DO IT PROPERLY YOU KNOW WE

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.614
WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE FUNDED

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.182
THAT SCALE AND WHAT I'VE SORT OF

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:02.484
SEEING THE DRAFT ON THESE

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:03.952
CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN AS YOU

01:22:04.019 --> 01:22:05.086
START OFF WITH TALKING WITH

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:06.755
CREATING ANOTHER AGENCY.

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.223
AND THEN YOU END UP JUST SAYING

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:09.157
WELL WE'LL JUST STICK IT WITHIN

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.293
LIKE OFFICE OF FIRE MARSHALL FOR

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:12.894
YOU KNOW ALL OR SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.029
YOU THE WITHIN THE STATE

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.497
STRUCTURE BECAUSE ONCE YOU START

01:22:15.563 --> 01:22:16.865
DOING THE CALCULATIONS WITH AT

01:22:16.931 --> 01:22:18.900
ACTUALLY IT SEEKS. TO SET UP AN

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:20.935
ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT AGENCY AND

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:22.404
THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT WOULD

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.639
SEEK TO ESTABLISH IT IS IT'S

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.341
IT'S A MASSIVE LEFT RIGHT AND I

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.209
THINK IT'S HARD YOU KNOW FOR ME

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.277
RIGHT NOW LIKE.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.845
YOU KNOW MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY

01:22:30.912 --> 01:22:31.980
IS ADDRESSING THE WHILE FOR A

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.615
CHALLENGE TO HELP IN THE STATE

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:34.849
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A

01:22:34.916 --> 01:22:36.451
LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:38.620
WORK ON THESE KIND OF CHALLENGES

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.221
TO WORK CIVIL TEDIOUSLY ON EXCEL

01:22:40.288 --> 01:22:41.189
RATING.

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.291
OUR RESPONSE TO WILD FIRES WHILE

01:22:43.358 --> 01:22:44.693
AT THE SAME TIME TRAINS THE

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:46.428
ABOLITION MASSIVE NEW AGENCY

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:47.762
WE'RE JUST GONNA NOT HOW ENOUGH

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.030
PEOPLE.

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.732
IN THE STATES WHO ARE WELL

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.067
VERSED ENOUGH IN THESE ISSUES

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.835
WHO CAN DO BOTH SO I THINK THAT

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.004
SORT OF THE STRUGGLE THAT HALL

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.772
WAS IN THE HALL DO YOU ACTUALLY

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:59.941
DO IT AND IS IT SOMETHING THAT

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.309
WE REALLY WANT TO PRIORITIZE

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.510
RATHER THAN.

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:05.013
ENHANCING YOU KNOW THE STRUCTURE

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.548
THAT WE ALREADY HEALTH SO ANYWAY

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:07.949
A LOW ENOUGH NO SHAKE YOU FOR

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.050
THAT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

01:23:09.117 --> 01:23:10.652
COMMENT ABOUT HAVING THE

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.886
INSPECTORS OR THE NUMBER OF

01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:18.727
INSPECTORS NECESSARY TO DO A

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.695
THOROUGH -- RESPONSIBLE JOB OF

01:23:20.762 --> 01:23:21.629
OF INSPECTING THE CITY

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:22.664
ELECTRICAL SIDE -- BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.199
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AND USING P.

01:23:24.265 --> 01:23:26.334
GENIE IS AN EXAMPLE OF FROM WHAT

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:27.602
WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST FEW

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.170
YEARS [inaudible]

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:30.972
DAISY.

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:34.709
THE QUALITY OF THEIR SEE WHAT

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:35.910
WOULD EVERYONE LOOK AT THIS

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.512
THEIR SAFETY EVALUATIONS THAT

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:39.013
JUST THE QUALITY OF THEIR SYSTEM

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.683
COMPARED TO ASSESS THE GENIE.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.618
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.519
THERE WAS A MAJOR MAJOR

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:47.155
DIFFERENCE THERE.

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:49.157
WOULD THAT BE UNKNOWN TO THE P.

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:53.862
UC WOULD THEY NOT HAVE HAD SOME.

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:56.064
ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.599
IS A DISTINCTION HERE OR THERE

01:23:57.665 --> 01:23:59.334
COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH THE

01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:01.503
SYSTEM THAT OF COURSE GOING BACK

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:02.971
TO THE GAS SYSTEM WE YOU KNOW

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.739
THERE WERE NO.

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.908
WE'LL ALARM SET WITH P. JEANNIE

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.743
IN THAT SYSTEM EITHER SO I GUESS

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.246
HOW DO WE WE HAVE A REGULATOR

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.782
HOW DO THEY ENFORCE THE

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:16.084
REGULATIONS ITSELF ENFORCEMENT

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:18.486
SELF REGULATED THAN IN A WAY.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.121
ITSELF MONITORED.

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:21.856
SO OF THE AUDITS OF THOSE THOUGH

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:23.158
IS THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:25.126
DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.461
PROBLEM AND THEY'RE NOT DOING

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:26.728
THEIR JOB.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:28.763
OR DO WE HAVE TO DO WE WAIT TILL

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.166
THAT.

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:33.668
DISASTER WELL AB THEY THINK THAT

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.036
THIS YOU KNOW MULTIPLE

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:37.472
COMPONENTS TO THIS AND THERE'S A

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:40.241
EITHER THERE IS THE THE WORK ALL

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:41.476
KNOWING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM

01:24:41.543 --> 01:24:43.578
MORE PROBLEMATIC OPERATOR AND

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:44.813
THEN.

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:49.918
THERE ARE THE LOVERS YES TO THE

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:50.585
YOU KNOW OF WHAT YOU CAN DO IN

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:52.187
THE REGULATORY SPACE TO GET THEM

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:54.122
TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR RATE IN

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:56.324
THOSE IT YET YOU CAN BE AWARE

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:58.059
THAT YOU HAVE AN OPERATOR WITH

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:59.727
ME BECAUSE ON THE PERFORMING.

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:02.363
THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY BE IN THAT.

01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:04.032
EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE INTENTION

01:25:04.098 --> 01:25:06.000
TO ANY USE YOUR TOOLS CORRECTLY

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.435
THAT THE OPERATOR ACTUALLY

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.204
RESPONDS IN THE WILL IT IN THE

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:10.738
WAY THAT PRODUCES THE RESULT

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:12.273
THAT YOU WANT I MEAN YOU.

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.376
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ON ON

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.111
THE BUT SINCE [inaudible]

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:18.580
HOURS EITHER OVER THOSE

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:20.248
OPERATORS RATE THEY WERE OUR OWN

01:25:20.315 --> 01:25:23.184
ECONOMIC AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF

01:25:23.251 --> 01:25:25.620
MECHANISMS THAT YOU CAN USE BUT

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:28.056
SOMETIMES THE FAIL RATE.

01:25:28.122 --> 01:25:31.559
AND SO YOU KNOW YOU HOW OF

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:32.760
CERTAIN OF THEM.

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:35.063
IT CAN OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:36.631
INCENTIVES THAT YOU CAN SEND

01:25:36.698 --> 01:25:38.299
RATE SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.134
ENOUGH RATE SO YOU KIND OF HAVE

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:42.737
TO KEEP DEVELOPING YOU TOOL BOX.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:45.640
IT IS THE THE IT IS A REGULATOR

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:48.176
AS TOWARDS PRESSURES YOU CAN

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.411
PORTS WELL THE REGULATED AND

01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:51.246
CITY.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.515
IN ORDER TO GET IT TO PERFORM IN

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:55.350
SUCH A WAY THAT PRODUCES THE

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.485
SOCIETAL RESULTS THAT WE WANT

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:59.754
RATE SO I THINK THERE'S A TWO

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.556
ZERO PARTS.

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:03.558
OF THIS -- YOU KNOW TO THIS

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:05.493
QUESTION THERE IS THE KNOWLEDGE

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.661
RATE IN THE MONITORING TO KNOW

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:08.496
HOW IS THE OPERATOR PERFORMING

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:10.431
IN IDENTIFYING ISSUES BEFORE THE

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:11.866
RESULT IN INCIDENTS.

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.535
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO WHAT YOU

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:17.739
CAN DO ALL AND AS YOU GET INTO

01:26:17.805 --> 01:26:19.541
SITUATIONS WHERE.

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:21.776
YOU THIS SONG METHODS.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.078
OF ARNOLD WORKING YOU NEED TO

01:26:24.145 --> 01:26:27.015
KEEP INCREASING YOUR CAPABILITY

01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:28.449
PROBABLY IN BOTH OF THOSE

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:30.385
DOMAINS.

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:31.920
WAY IN IN GRAVITY TO THE NUMBER

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:36.024
OF INSPECTORS THE THAT THE FAA

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:36.691
FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN I DON'T THINK.

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.760
THEY DON'T HAVE INSPECTORS.

01:26:38.826 --> 01:26:40.328
INSPECTING EVERY AIRPLANE THEY

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.363
DON'T HAVE INSPECTORS THAT ARE

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:43.731
OUT THERE CONSTANTLY.

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:45.466
MONITORING WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

01:26:45.533 --> 01:26:47.635
AIRLINES I MEAN THERE IS SELF

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:49.070
REGULATION AND THEY HAVE

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.738
INTERNAL INSPECTORS I BELIEVE

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.473
THAT OUR PEOPLE FROM THE COMPANY

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.875
THAT ACTUALLY TAKE THAT

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.810
RESPONSIBILITY AND AND AND DO

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:58.246
THE JOB THAT EXPECTED OF THEM

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:00.114
AND REQUIRED OF THEM BY.

01:27:00.181 --> 01:27:02.717
THE FAA OR THE REGULATOR NAM

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.652
MAYBE JUMPING OUT OF OUT OF MY

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:07.655
REALM HERE BUT I WOULD THINK

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.023
THAT'S HOW IT WOULD OPERATE.

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:11.859
ESPECIALLY FOR THE FAA THE NRC.

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:13.695
HAS ITS OWN PEOPLE BUT THAT THE

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:15.797
FAA DOES USE IN EXPECTS TO HAVE

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:18.933
SOME INSPECTION DONE BY THE

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.569
COMPANIES THEMSELVES. ONE FLIGHT

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.504
A CLARIFICATION MAYBE TO BE MADE

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:24.639
HERE IS THAT.

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:26.507
WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT A LOT

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.642
OF INSPECTIONS?

01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:28.610
I WAS NOT NECESSARILY TALKING

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.311
ABOUT PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS WERE

01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:31.679
SOMEBODY GOES OUT AND LOOKS SO

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.314
ALL THE MILES OF RAIL OR THE

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.215
LINE.

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.984
BUT SAFETY MANAGEMENT MAN

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:37.585
ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT

01:27:37.652 --> 01:27:39.887
INSPECTIONS WERE PEOPLE LOOK AT

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:41.322
MAYBE THEY'LL GO IN AND SAMPLE

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.057
SOME WORK PLANNING SESSIONS FOR

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:44.759
EXAMPLE OR SIT IN ON A MEETING.

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.527
AND SEE WHAT'S BEING DONE AT THE

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:48.463
SUPERVISORY LEVEL OR SPEND THE

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:49.597
DAY IN A CONTROL ROOM AND SEE

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:51.065
WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DOING

01:27:51.132 --> 01:27:52.900
AND WHAT PRESSURES THERE UNDER.

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:54.335
AND I THINK.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:56.537
THERE IS THERE ARE SOME ISSUES

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:57.839
IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT.

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:00.942
THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ASSET

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:03.711
AND THE THE A TECHNOLOGY TYPE.

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:06.314
ARE IMPORTANT ACROSS THOSE

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.649
SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE THAT THEY

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:08.850
KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:09.917
SAFETY CULTURE IN TERMS OF

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:11.285
COMMUNICATION PATTERNS.

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:13.921
ETCETERA AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:14.589
COULD.

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:16.024
COULD DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO

01:28:16.090 --> 01:28:17.291
GO OUT AND LOOK ALL OVER THE

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.394
ENTIRE GEOGRAPHY FOR EXAMPLE OF

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.728
A UTILITY.

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:23.531
DIRECTOR YOU COMFORTABLE WITH --

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:27.001
ESSAYS. TWO YEAR TENURE THE WORK

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:28.636
THEY'VE DONE.

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:30.705
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:33.441
COULD EXPAND THAT OR DO A BETTER

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:36.444
JOB OF AND BEEN FORESEEN IN

01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:39.447
BRINGING IN A SAFETY SYSTEM.

01:28:39.514 --> 01:28:41.115
MANAGEMENT TO THE UTILITIES AND

01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:44.886
WITHIN THE P. UC [inaudible]

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:47.355
OWN.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.891
A SINGLE WAS THE HOUSE ADDED

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:52.193
VALUE HOME.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.362
A THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:56.097
THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE SAFETY

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:58.366
FUNCTIONS THAT WE WANT THE PC TO

01:28:58.433 --> 01:29:01.102
PLAY -- AND HOW TO STRUCTURE

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:02.837
LONG HOME AND THIS AGAIN THERE'S

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:05.073
DIFFERENCE WAYS THAT YOU CAN

01:29:05.139 --> 01:29:06.974
ACCOMPLISH IT YOU KNOW THEY

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.010
THINK THAT THERE ARE.

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:14.248
A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES WITH HOW --

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.317
THE CITY WAS DESIGNED THAT HAS

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.152
SO SORT OF PLEA DEALT THROUGH

01:29:18.219 --> 01:29:19.487
THIS PILOT PHASE.

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:22.623
THAT ANYTHING COULD BE HOPEFUL

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:27.161
WHO -- RESOLVE OR OR CLARIFY.

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:29.630
HOME ONE OF THIS THOUGH IS THE

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:31.499
WHOLE QUESTION OF SAFETY

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.401
ADVOCACY WHAT THAT MEANS.

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:35.269
ELEMENT IN THE UC CONTEXT

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:36.938
ADVOCACY MEANS SOMETHING VERY

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:38.106
SPECIFIC.

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:40.441
ELEMENT.

01:29:40.508 --> 01:29:42.677
AND THERE IS THE THE REAL GOOD

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:45.713
REASONS FOR FOR THAT OF RATE

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.914
THEY THERE IS THE HUGE.

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.517
ELM EVERYTHING THE YOU KNOW THE

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:54.188
ANY -- ORGANIZATION ANY ANY TYPE

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:55.990
ANYTIME YOU HALL THE REGULATORY

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:57.725
FRAMEWORK IT NEEDS TO HELP THE

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:01.062
PROCESS HOUSE WAYS TO COLLECT

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:02.897
INFORMATION THINK THROUGH ISSUES

01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:03.965
AND RESOLVE THEM RIGHT THE P.

01:30:04.031 --> 01:30:06.100
YOU SEE HIGHS CERTAIN PROCESS AS

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:07.468
ITS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESSES RATE.

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.270
BUT ADVOCACY MEANS A VERY

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:11.639
SPECIFIC THING AND IT HAS AN

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:13.141
IMPORTANT ROLE.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:15.710
OF AND THEN EIGHT THINK WHAT

01:30:15.777 --> 01:30:16.878
HAPPENING WITH GO WITH SAY IS

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:18.446
THAT THE SORT OF THE CAPITAL

01:30:18.513 --> 01:30:21.082
LETTER FORMAL ADVOCACY GETS

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:23.985
COMPLETED WITH AN INFORMAL WAY

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.387
YOU USE ADVOCACY IN TERMS OF A

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:27.655
PROMOTER.

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:28.923
IT IS THE YOU KNOW WITH SOMEBODY

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.892
WHO'S A SAFETY EXPERT AND

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:32.460
PROMOTE SAFETY IS A MOTION.

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:36.063
AND IN THE P. YOU SEE CONTACTS

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:38.766
IN AND IT DOES TWO THINGS AREN'T

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:40.835
NECESSARILY THE SAME THING OR

01:30:40.902 --> 01:30:42.637
SHOULD BE THE SAME THING AND

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:44.205
CONFLATING NUMBERS CREATING.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:47.375
CERTAIN ISSUES SO THAT YEAR I

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.977
THINK IT KIND OF IF I CAN SEEK

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.346
ONCE THE BACK -- SOMETHING THAT

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:53.881
THE THE BACKGROUND PAPERS

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:55.683
TALKING ABOUT AND SENATE HELLO I

01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:57.051
THINK YOU PHONE.

01:30:57.118 --> 01:30:58.152
HOW ABOUT IN YOUR OPENING

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.387
COMMENTS IS THIS?

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:02.456
QUESTION ABOUT REAP MAKING AS

01:31:02.523 --> 01:31:04.992
THE ELM IS A MECHANISM AND WHERE

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:06.327
IT HOUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SORT

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:08.162
OF THE PC FOR PRIMARY WAY OF

01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.963
DEALING WITH THINGS AND

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.931
WAREHOUSE STRENGTHS AND

01:31:09.997 --> 01:31:10.998
WEAKNESSES IN THE MAY BE

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:12.733
COMPARING IT TO THE BECAUSE I

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.601
LEGISLATIVE.

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:17.638
WAY WELL EACH YEAR. TO ME EITHER

01:31:17.705 --> 01:31:19.540
THE QC DOESN'T GENERALLY

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.409
FUNCTIONS THE COURTHOUSE -- YEAR

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:23.578
THAT IS HOW IT HAS DIFFERENT

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:24.612
TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS AND

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.013
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS A SLIGHTLY

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.815
DIFFERENT RULES BUT ULTIMATELY

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:38.860
IT WAS SET UP TO ALLOW.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:39.727
FOUR ELM.

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:41.395
CONSIDERATION BUT FOR ALL THE

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:42.363
STAKEHOLDERS THAT INVOLVED IN

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:42.930
THE ISSUES TO COME IN ARGUE

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:43.764
THEIR POINTS AND THEN FOR A FAIR

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.199
PROCESS TO EVALUATE FACTS AND

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:46.701
THEN COME TO BALANCE DECISION

01:31:46.767 --> 01:31:47.335
THAT IS.

01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:48.402
THE CORE OF HOPE YOU SEE

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:48.769
FUNCTIONS RATE.

01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:50.571
AND IN CERTAIN AREAS IT DOES

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.673
WORK WE WILL WORK FAIRLY WELL UL

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:53.541
LI CREEK MAKING AS AN EXAMPLE

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:54.742
WHERE YOU HAVE A UTILITY ASKING

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:55.910
FOR MONEY AND THEN THE REPAIR

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.245
INTRAVENOUS COME AND THEN ARGUE

01:31:57.311 --> 01:31:58.179
THEIR POINTS AND THEN YOU KIND

01:31:58.246 --> 01:31:59.547
OF THAT LAND IN THE MDDLE

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:00.548
SOMEWHERE.

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:03.551
IT'S WORKED VERY WELL IN -- WHEN

01:32:03.618 --> 01:32:08.456
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RENEWABLES?

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:09.991
BECAUSE YOU HOW OF ORGANIZED

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:12.260
LOBBIES L. FOR SOLAR DEVELOPERS

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:13.594
FOR EXAMPLE FOR VERY ELOQUENCE.

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:15.029
TO ARGUE THEIR POINTS AGAIN YOU

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.931
YOU HAVE A RECORD THAT'S

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.499
BALANCED OR BASED ON WHICH YOU

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.434
COMMISSION CAN WEIGH THE FACTS

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.203
AND AND COME UP WITH SOME.

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:25.172
DECISIONS IN THE CASE OF SAFETY

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:29.110
THAT NATURALLY DOESN'T ARISE SO

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.244
THAT IS THE NEW.

01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:33.414
THE P. YOU SEE PROCESS IN THIS

01:32:33.481 --> 01:32:35.549
IN THE CASE OF SAFETY WHETHER

01:32:35.616 --> 01:32:38.319
IT'S READ SETTING BECAUSE THEY

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:41.222
LEGISLATOR OF WERE ANYTHING ELSE.

01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:42.556
DOZENS.

01:32:42.623 --> 01:32:45.259
IT BREAKS DOWN BECAUSE YOU DON'T

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:46.527
HEALTH PARTIES.

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:51.899
OUT THERE WHO ADVOCATES FOR

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.902
SAFETY AND WELL IN IT THERE IS

01:32:54.969 --> 01:32:56.737
NO WAY FOR THEM TO ARISE.

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:57.305
BECAUSE THERE'S NO ECONOMIC

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:59.373
CONSENSUS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.375
SORT OF MAKE A LIVING RATE.

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:03.044
ELEMENTS SO [inaudible]

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:08.316
THE SAFETY ADVOCATES.

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.184
YOU KNOW FOR ME AGAIN THE FORMAL

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.219
POINTS OF VIEW THERE IS THIS GAP

01:33:12.286 --> 01:33:14.822
WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY WHO

01:33:14.889 --> 01:33:17.091
SERVE PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.459
INTO THE RECORD.

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.461
RATE IN THE RISEN IMPORTANT

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:23.230
FUNCTION. TO HAVE SOMEBODY DO

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:24.165
THAT.

01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:25.633
RATE SO THAT THE RATE IS A

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:27.635
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DIALOGUE

01:33:27.702 --> 01:33:29.704
AND DEBATE AND THAT WAS FROM A

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.872
FORMAL POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT IS

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:34.008
A SAFETY.

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.309
OFFICE OF CT ADVOCATE CAN

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:37.445
PERFORM THIS FORMAL ADVOCACY AND

01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:38.579
I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT THAT

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.314
AND I DO THINK THAT THAT IS A

01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:41.882
FUNCTION.

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:44.352
THAT SQUARE -- SAY HAS DONE WELL

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:46.153
IN AND GIVEN ADDITIONAL

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.622
RESOURCES CAN DO AN EVEN BETTER

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:51.225
JOB AT BUT IT DOESN'T SOLVE.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.961
ALL OF THESE FOR ALL OF PROBLEMS

01:33:54.028 --> 01:33:55.830
WELL WILL SHORTCOMINGS THAT WE

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:56.597
CURRENTLY HAVE IN THEIR SAFETY

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.300
PARADIGM YOU KNOW IT JUST THE

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:00.935
YOU KNOW SEE IF THE ADVOCACY ON

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:03.471
THE RECORD IT IS A GAP.

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:04.839
IT NEEDS TO GET FILLED IN THE

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:05.840
WITH SAY CAN FILL IT AND IF WE

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.575
CAN GIVE IT GET MORE RESOURCES I

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:09.276
THINKING CAN DO IN A REALLY GOOD

01:34:09.343 --> 01:34:10.611
JOB.

01:34:10.678 --> 01:34:12.947
BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER AREAS

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:14.915
WHERE WE CURRENTLY.

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:20.488
EL HALL OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:34:20.554 --> 01:34:20.821
IMPROVEMENTS.

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.456
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

01:34:22.523 --> 01:34:23.858
CASE THAT WE NEED TO LUMP

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:25.926
EVERYTHING ON TO ALWAYS SAY TO

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:26.961
TO SORT OF FULL BLOWN RATE.

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:29.964
SO ELM SOME OF THE EXAMPLES.

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.632
FOR THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS I

01:34:31.699 --> 01:34:33.200
COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH DOCTOR

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:35.169
SHULMAN ON THE US YOU KNOW AS

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.937
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ONE OF THE

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:39.340
BIGGEST GAPS THAT WE HAVE IN

01:34:39.407 --> 01:34:40.641
SAFETY.

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:43.444
IS ACTUALLY IN THE IN.

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.147
THE IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T.

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:49.116
HOW OF ANYBODY WHO IS DEDICATED

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.818
TO SAFETY POLICY?

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.787
ARM AND THEY KIND OF LINE THAT

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:57.091
UP WITH RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.592
THAT YOU WE DON'T HAVE.

01:34:58.659 --> 01:34:59.727
STAFF OR RESOURCES OR ANYONE WHO

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:02.596
ACTUALLY STUDIES SAFETY AND

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:05.199
COMES UP WITH PROPOSALS AND SO

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:07.535
AND AGAIN IT'S A DIFFERENT

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.370
FUNCTION FROM ADVOCACY.

01:35:09.437 --> 01:35:12.073
RATE IT YOU KNOW WEEK IT IS AND

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:13.908
THE YEAR WE NEED IT AND I'M

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.376
TRYING TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW IN

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:16.777
THE WILD FIRE SPACE.

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:18.846
WHERE WE HAVE THIS IS SORT OF SB

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.281
NINE A ONE RATE THAT SETS UP THE

01:35:20.347 --> 01:35:21.782
WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN THIS IS

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:23.584
A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.920
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT? TO THE ITEM

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:27.488
TO GET SET UP AS UTILITIES FILES

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.090
THE PLAN IN THE AND THEN THE PC

01:35:29.156 --> 01:35:30.591
NEEDS TO EVALUATE THEM MAKE A

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.259
DECISION SO UTILITY FILE THEIR

01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:33.360
PLAN.

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:35.196
RIGHT WE'LL STOP THE WEEK

01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:37.231
COMMISSION IS DESIGNED AREN'T

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:39.266
SET UP TO COME UP WITH A COUNTER

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:40.601
PROPOSAL TO THIS RIGHT YOU

01:35:40.668 --> 01:35:42.036
RESPONDING TO WOULD BE UTILITIES

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.170
FILED.

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:45.272
AND THEN WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:46.540
THE RECORD THAT THAT GETS THE

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.442
BALL GOOD OVER THIRTY PARTIES

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:50.010
THE JOIN THOSE PROCEEDINGS.

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:51.212
WHEN WE WERE PLANNING FOR

01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:53.380
WORKSHOPS I SEND OUT?

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:55.249
A REQUEST TO THE PARTIES TO SAY

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:56.317
OKAY WE'RE GONNA HOP SOME SOME

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:57.685
WORKSHOPS AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:00.287
FOCUS ON THE DECISION MANAGEMENT.

ALL MY WHO.

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:18.205
WE YOU KNOW WE DO SOME

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:19.740
QUESTIONING IN DISCUSSION WITH

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:20.908
UTILITIES DO ANY OF THE PARTIES

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.443
HAVE EXPERTS.

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:23.644
THEY DIDN'T RATE BECAUSE DORAL

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.411
SPECIAL INTERESTS GROUPS LIKE

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:25.679
FULLER OR MICHAEL GOOD

01:36:25.746 --> 01:36:27.281
DEVELOPERS OR WHATEVER WHO DON'T

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:29.183
ACTUALLY HAVE SUBJECT MATTER

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.251
EXPERTISE IN THE US.

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:32.019
AND THE STAFF AGAIN WE WERE

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.988
NEVER SET UP. TO HAVE THAT

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:35.489
EXPERTISE EITHER THE ROLE OF

01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:37.458
ADVISORY STAFF OF THE COMMISSION

01:36:37.525 --> 01:36:40.127
IS TO LOOK AT THE RECORD AND ALL

01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:41.295
OF THE DIFFERENT INFORMATION THE

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:42.763
PARTIES A SUBMITTED AND HOPE THE

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:45.533
JUDGE MAKES SENSE OF THE RECORD.

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:46.100
IT'S NOT TO DEVELOP OUR OWN

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:48.035
RECORD THE RIGHT NOW IT'S A

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:50.037
COMPLETE GAP BREAK SO I MEAN WE

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:51.672
KIND OF DID THE THE BEST WE

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:53.340
COULD WITH THIS FIRST ROUND BUT

01:36:53.407 --> 01:36:54.575
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IT

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:56.710
JUST CAME OUT OF ANOTHER HEARING

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:58.179
FOR BUDGET FOR ME REALIZE IS.

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.914
FOR CONSULTING MONEY SO WE CAN

01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:01.682
ACTUALLY P. SOMEONE'S WHO'LL

01:37:01.749 --> 01:37:06.353
COME IN AND BRING THIS EXPERTISE.

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:07.555
TO DEVELOP SOME OF THE CRITERIA

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.557
FOR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS

01:37:09.623 --> 01:37:11.825
AT THE WE CAN USE KIND OF AS A

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:13.394
STAFF PROPOSAL.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.362
THAT IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:17.731
JUST THE UTILITY POINTS OF VIEW

01:37:17.798 --> 01:37:20.568
THEN THEN YOU CAN SORT OF USE AS

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:22.803
A BASIS.

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:26.440
FOR EACH YEAR OLD FROM.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.675
FOR FOR HELPING THE EAGLE.

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:28.709
THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE WANT

01:37:28.776 --> 01:37:30.144
THE UTILITIES TO GO IN IN THE

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:32.146
VALUATION CRITERIA BUT THIS

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:33.214
EXAMPLE THAT WAS STRUGGLING WITH

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.949
THEM WILD FIRES AT THE PLACE

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.350
ACROSS THE BOARD RATE.

01:37:36.417 --> 01:37:40.054
SO IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WE NEED TO

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.423
IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE --

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:44.391
IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFETY OVER LONG

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.327
TERM WE HAVE TO START ADDRESSING

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:48.329
THIS MUCH EARLIER THAN WHERE WE

01:37:48.395 --> 01:37:49.897
ARE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW GO ON THE

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.165
AS YOU KNOW THE QUITE A FEW

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:52.299
THESE INCIDENTS AND EVERY SINGLE

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:53.734
TIME THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:54.768
I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE.

01:37:54.835 --> 01:37:56.537
IN SAFETY EVERYBODY ALWAYS GOES

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.639
TO ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE AS

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.140
THE SOLUTION RATE.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:01.575
AND THAT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE

01:38:01.642 --> 01:38:03.344
DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT WE DON'T

01:38:03.410 --> 01:38:05.145
DO THAT IN OTHER AREAS YOU KNOW

01:38:05.212 --> 01:38:06.780
WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE YOU

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:08.249
KNOW RENEWABLES OR SOMETHING

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:09.717
ELSE SOMEBODY JUMPS TO

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:10.918
ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IS

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:12.553
THE SOLUTION YOU START POLICY

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:13.320
RATE.

01:38:13.387 --> 01:38:14.755
AND HOW BEING YOU KNOW AN

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.223
ARTICULATION OF WHAT YOU

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:17.925
ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.760
THEN SAFETY WERE ALWAYS STARTING

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.262
AT THE BACK THE FILMING.

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:22.663
THE DOES REGULATIONS ALREADY

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:26.467
TAKE YOU KNOW EXIST AND SO AGAIN

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:28.702
I THINK TO JUST TROOPS ARE AT NO

01:38:28.769 --> 01:38:29.570
AT THEY WON THE LONG.

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:32.139
ANSWER HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR

01:38:32.206 --> 01:38:34.341
WITH STATE NEEDS TO KIND OF SOLD

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:36.010
ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS I THINK

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:37.411
THEY'VE DONE WELL ON THE FORMAL

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.779
ADVOCACY PIECE IN THE SHOULD

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:40.681
CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND WE

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:42.249
SHOULD EVALUATE HOW TO CLOSE.

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:43.484
SOME OF THOSE OTHER GAPS AROUND

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:45.552
RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND JUST

01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:46.854
POLICY DEVELOPMENTS AND ALWAYS

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:53.794
SEE MAY OR MAY NOT BE LIKE THE

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:56.130
THE PRIMARY WAY OF ACHIEVING NOT.

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:57.398
DO THAT BUT HOW DO YOU SEE THEM

01:38:57.464 --> 01:38:58.132
IT IN ANOTHER ROLE I MEAN.

01:38:58.198 --> 01:38:58.465
TAKING MORE.

01:38:58.532 --> 01:38:59.133
A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN LOOKING AT

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.601
THE UTILITIES AND LOOKING AT IN

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:02.436
NOT JUST DURING RATE CASES BUT

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:03.003
IN [inaudible]

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.238
NO.

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.606
LOOKING IT'S BEING THAT SAFETY

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.074
ADVOCATE IN ADVOCATE IN WHATEVER

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.642
HOWEVER WE WANTED TO FIND IT BUT

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:10.010
NOT JUST AS AN ADVOCATE IN A

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:11.845
RAPE CASE BUT AN ADVOCATE IN

01:39:11.912 --> 01:39:13.380
TRYING TRYING TO PROMOTE THAT.

01:39:13.447 --> 01:39:16.116
AND ALSO SAFETY WITHIN THE CPUC

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:17.685
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CULTURE

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:19.953
IS IS THERE AND AS WE KNOW THAT.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:20.621
THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE IN THE

01:39:20.688 --> 01:39:21.689
PAST.

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:24.658
YEAR I THINK THAT ELEMENT THERE

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:27.528
IS CONFLICT OVER HAVING THE

01:39:27.594 --> 01:39:31.265
FORMAL SAFETY ADVOCATES WHO ALSO

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:33.200
HAS A FUNCTION WITHIN THE

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:33.634
COMMISSION.

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:34.868
OF ME.

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:37.938
BECAUSE WHEN.

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.373
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ARE IN THEIR

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.377
FORMAL ADVOCACY ROLE

01:39:43.444 --> 01:39:43.677
[inaudible]

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:45.946
OF THE ORG ALMOST LIKE AN

01:39:46.013 --> 01:39:48.449
EXTERNAL PARTY AND HARMING THE

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:50.250
SAME PEOPLE SORT OF TELL THE

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:51.885
COMMISSION WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO

01:39:51.952 --> 01:39:53.987
DO ITS ROLE AND THEN BE A PARTY

01:39:54.054 --> 01:39:55.122
TO THE CASE THAT THE COMMISSION

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:57.257
DECIDES IT'S AN IT'S AN INHERENT

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:58.192
CONFLICT.

01:39:58.258 --> 01:39:59.626
YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO THAT THEN

01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:01.261
RATE LIKE WHAT RATE OR IT

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:02.563
DOESN'T TELL ENERGY DIVISION

01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:04.932
HALL TO DO ALL YOUR BILL RATE

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:06.667
MAKING ON ONE HAND WHAT'S ALL

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:08.102
THE COMMISSIONERS OF HALL TOOL

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:08.736
YOU KNOW.

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:10.137
SORT OF THE VALUE IT RATES AND

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:11.472
THEN ALSO ACT AS A PARTY IN

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:12.906
COMMISSIONS PROCEEDING SO A

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:15.509
THINK I DON'T SEE A CONFLICT IN.

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.643
A WITH SAY.

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.846
BEING A LARGER ADVOCATES IN THE

01:40:18.912 --> 01:40:21.115
UTILITIES SPACE AND ENGAGING

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.250
WITH UTILITIES BOTH YOU KNOW IN

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:24.985
THE CONTEXT ALL OF YOU THE

01:40:25.052 --> 01:40:26.153
LITIGATION WITHIN.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.322
L. EITHER AS AN ADVOCATE AND

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:30.424
THEN ALSO CAN OF GENERALLY

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:33.761
PROMOTING ELM YOU'LL SAFETY YOU

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:35.496
THOUGH CULTURE AND AND THINGS

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:36.563
LIKE THAT.

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:38.799
A BOY A DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:39.967
VERY DIFFICULT TO BE AN

01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:41.935
INDEPENDENT SAFETY ADVOCATES

01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:43.670
WERE YOUR ROLE IS TO BE THE

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.272
LEADING GAUGE BY JUST.

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:46.840
BY THE THE NATIONAL FORMAL

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.142
ADVOCACY.

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:49.610
WITHIN THE COMMISSION PROCEEDING

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:56.083
AND ALSO HOW OF THIS KIND OLD.

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:56.784
TELLING THE COMMISSION HELL TO

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:58.185
DO ITS JOB FUNCTION EIGHT THING

01:40:58.252 --> 01:40:59.787
THAT SHOULD GET DE CONFLICTED IN

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:00.654
MY OPINION PUT IT INTO THE THIS

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:01.288
USUALLY HAVE THE SAFETY ACTION

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.056
PLAN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THAT

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:04.191
IS THAT.

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.259
ELEMENT GOT REPLACED BY THE

01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:08.562
SAFETY STRATEGIC DIRECTIVES --

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.364
THE EITHER YOU JUST DO THIS TOO

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:12.166
MANY COMPETING KIND OF WELL L.

01:41:12.232 --> 01:41:14.034
PARADIGM SO WE HAVE THE SAFETY

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:15.269
ACTION PLANS BEFORE THE

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:16.136
COMMISSION ONCE WITH THE

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:18.972
STRATEGIC DIRECT OF EXERCISE.

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:20.607
AND NOW HOW OLD.

01:41:20.674 --> 01:41:22.176
WE HOW ALL OF THIS THIS

01:41:22.242 --> 01:41:23.577
STRATEGIC DIRECTORS THAT HAVE

01:41:23.644 --> 01:41:25.179
BEEN ADOPTED BY THE QUé WE HAVE

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:26.547
THE SAFETY VISION THE SAFETY OF

01:41:26.613 --> 01:41:29.183
THE STRATEGIC DIRECTOR OF AND

01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:31.718
THEN THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.320
THE COMMISSION EVALUATES.

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:35.456
THE PERFORMANCE OF PC STAFF IN

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:37.291
FULFILLING THAT STRATEGIC

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:38.058
DIRECTIVES THERE ISN'T A

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:40.461
SEPARATE SAFETY ACTION PLAN. TO

01:41:40.527 --> 01:41:42.463
WHOSE ACTUALLY WORKING ON

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:43.831
DEVELOPING SOME LONG TERM.

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.766
YOU KNOW SAFETY VISION WITHIN

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:50.971
THE P. UC IS THAT IN THAT

01:41:51.038 --> 01:41:52.739
DIRECTIVE.

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:53.774
FOR IS ANYONE DOING THAT TODAY.

01:41:53.841 --> 01:41:57.144
YES A A THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:41:57.211 --> 01:41:59.580
IT HAPPENS A DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:02.516
FLOW THERE ARE.

01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:04.618
THIS LEAF TEA THE STRATEGIC

01:42:04.685 --> 01:42:06.887
DIRECTIVE PROCESS IS REALLY.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.889
WHERE THE COMMISSIONERS GET TO

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.457
COMMUNICATE WITH STUFF

01:42:10.524 --> 01:42:11.492
RATE BECAUSE THE GOOD THE

01:42:11.558 --> 01:42:13.060
DIRECTOR OF THE SET BY THE

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:14.995
COMMISSIONERS AS THE BODY AND

01:42:15.062 --> 01:42:17.598
THE SAFETY DIRECTIVES PROCESS IS

01:42:17.664 --> 01:42:20.534
THE THE THE FEEDBACK MECHANISM

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:22.669
ELSE TO HOW THE THOUGHT OFFICE

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:23.804
FULL.

01:42:23.871 --> 01:42:26.039
OUT THOSE OBLIGATIONS AND WHERE

THE COMMISSIONER C. L.

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:29.710
OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:32.312
AND AND SO ON YOU KNOW AND THEN

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:37.084
THAT HAPPENS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS.

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:39.987
SO L. -- IT OPENS FIRMS ALL OF

01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:42.689
IT HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED BY STAFF

01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:44.424
IN WHAT THE SAFETY VISION IS FOR

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:47.427
THE AGENCY -- IN MY VIEW THE

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:49.229
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALSO MONTHLY

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:51.265
OWNS THAT'S AS THE HAD ALL OF

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.567
THE OF THE COMMISSION.

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:56.103
ELEMENT AND THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:57.738
DIRECTOR FOR FOR SAFETY IN THE

01:42:57.804 --> 01:43:00.307
FORCE ONE POLICY IS.

THE PERSON WHO IS SORT OF THE

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:04.511
PRIMARY.

DIRECTOR ON MATHS AND IS THE

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.150
PERSON WHO WAS SORT OF

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:12.753
RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR DEVELOPING

01:43:12.819 --> 01:43:14.354
THAT UNIFIED ELM.

01:43:14.421 --> 01:43:15.556
VISION AND THEN THE INSURING

01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:17.491
THAT OLD EIGHT DIFFERENT GROUPS

01:43:17.558 --> 01:43:18.825
THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CARRYING IT

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:20.427
OUT THERE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:22.396
PERFORMING THAT FUNCTION.

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:24.498
THERE BEEN SOME CHANGES IN YOU

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:26.033
JUST GET OF REFERRING TO THE THE

01:43:26.099 --> 01:43:26.934
STRUCTURE OF THE P. UC AND HOW

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.135
THINGS FIT IN THERE BEEN SOME

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:30.938
RECENT CHANGES -- AND IS A IS

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:32.706
NOW UNDER.

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:37.144
VIA A CD IS THAT CORRECT NO NO

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:38.879
THERE'S STILL SEPARATES.

01:43:38.946 --> 01:43:43.116
DIVISION ELEMENTS SO THE END WE

01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:45.986
ARE WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:47.287
OF HOW.

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:49.222
CAN OF TO FUNCTIONALLY SPLIT ITS

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:51.892
BUT THE ELM.

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:58.098
THE VISION IS FOR THE FOR THE L..

01:43:58.165 --> 01:43:59.433
FIFTY ANON FORSMAN FUNCTIONS THE

01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:01.635
FULL ON THE ONE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:03.303
DIRECTOR AND THEN YOU HOLDEN

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:05.072
DEPENDING TO UNITS UNDERNEATH

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:06.807
THAT SO SAFETY LOW FORSMAN

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:07.641
DIVISION.

01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:09.109
WITH DIESEL DIVISION WITH THE

01:44:09.176 --> 01:44:10.477
DIRECTOR OFFICE OF SAFETY

01:44:10.544 --> 01:44:12.279
ADVOCATES IS A SEPARATE DIVISION

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:13.880
WITH THE WRONG DIRECTOR.

01:44:13.947 --> 01:44:16.516
AND THE THE ROLE OF THE DEPUTY

01:44:16.583 --> 01:44:17.985
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SAFETY IN

01:44:18.051 --> 01:44:19.453
THE FIRST MONTH IS TO MAKE SURE

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:21.588
THAT ACROSS ALL THE FUNCTIONS

01:44:21.655 --> 01:44:23.490
FROM POLICY MAKING.

01:44:23.557 --> 01:44:25.993
YOU KNOW THE ADVOCACY ADVISORY

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:28.228
ENFORCEMENTS THAT EACH OF THOSE

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:30.697
ELEMENTS FUNCTIONS ULTIMATELY IN

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:33.867
THE EVERYTHING MAKE SCHOOL HE SO --

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:36.570
COHESIVE SENSE BUT IS THE IDEAS

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:37.871
THAT THE EACH UNIT WOULD STILL

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.539
HAVE COMPLETED THE PENDANT SO

01:44:39.606 --> 01:44:42.042
THERE IS NO YES ALWAYS SAY WOULD

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.577
NOT BE ABSORBED BY SIXTEEN THE

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:48.949
HORSEMEN DIVISION BECAUSE OF THE

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:49.516
FROM FUNCTIONS AND ROLES FOR

01:44:49.583 --> 01:44:50.350
FALL.

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:51.985
HE AND HE IS.

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:53.086
HOW IS -- IS A DIFFERENT FROM --

01:44:53.153 --> 01:44:53.687
THE RISK ASSESSMENTS SAFETY

01:44:53.754 --> 01:44:56.456
ADVISER.

01:44:56.523 --> 01:44:58.992
WELL AGAIN THE MAIN THE MAIN

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.662
THEIR FRIENDS IS IN.

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:04.698
THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE WITHOUT THE

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:08.468
CASEY -- IS THE I THINK THE CORE

01:45:08.535 --> 01:45:10.070
ALL OF THE OF WHAT THE ALWAYS

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:12.539
SAY WILL SET UP TO ADDRESS WAS

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:14.074
THE GAP THAT THERE WAS NO FORMAL

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.375
INTERVENOR.

01:45:15.442 --> 01:45:18.145
IN BRIEFCASES SPECIFICALLY BUT

01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:19.980
THEN OTHER PROCEEDINGS WALL THE

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:21.615
ADVOCATE.

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:22.816
FOR SIXTY RISK ASSESSMENTS WAS

01:45:22.883 --> 01:45:25.018
NEVER YOU THAT WAS ALWAYS

01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:26.987
WORKING IN THE ADVISORY FUNCTION

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.155
AND BOTH.

01:45:28.221 --> 01:45:29.890
ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU NEED

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:31.925
STAFF TO SUPPORT COMMISSIONERS

01:45:31.992 --> 01:45:33.627
AND THE L. O. IN ADMINS SHOULD

01:45:33.694 --> 01:45:34.528
LAW JUDGE.

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:36.296
IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.831
RECORD DRAFTING OF DECISIONS

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.599
CREATING STUFF PROPOSALS THINGS

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.468
LIKE THAT AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.837
ON THE RECORD WHO ACTUALLY.

01:45:43.904 --> 01:45:46.907
HAS A POSITION AND DOES A TO TWO

01:45:46.973 --> 01:45:50.977
DIFFERENT NEEDS AND BOTH OF THEM

01:45:51.044 --> 01:45:54.181
HAVE TO BE -- NO MATTER

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:54.481
[inaudible]

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:56.750
PACEY THE THE END OF IT THE

01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:58.652
COUPLE MORE THINGS HERE IN IN --

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:01.021
WE CAN WRAP UP BUT WANTED TO

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:02.589
CONTINUE KIND OF A DISCUSSION ON

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:05.058
ON THE CULTURE -- NOT WITHIN AN

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:06.626
ORGANIZATION AS IMPORTANT AS

01:46:06.693 --> 01:46:08.528
THAT IS BUT THE CULTURE BETWEEN

01:46:08.595 --> 01:46:09.996
THE REGULATED UTILITIES AS WE

01:46:10.063 --> 01:46:13.200
SEE IT AND THEIR REGULATOR -- IN

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:16.470
WHAT WHAT CULTURE KINDA DRIVES

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:19.072
SAFETY WHAT WHAT.

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.741
HOW CAN WE? TO THAT POINT TO

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:24.945
WHERE THERE IS A A SAFETY.

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:26.980
CULTURE OF THAT IN SAFETY IS

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.482
PART OF THAT CULTURE HOW HOW

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.083
DOES THAT -- HOWEVER THAT THAT

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:32.986
WORK.

01:46:33.053 --> 01:46:33.887
YEAH.

01:46:33.954 --> 01:46:35.956
AS USUAL -- SO THAT'S A VERY

01:46:36.022 --> 01:46:37.090
GOOD QUESTION.

01:46:37.157 --> 01:46:38.725
AND LIKE MANY QUESTIONS THAT SO

01:46:38.792 --> 01:46:42.062
EASY ANSWER BUT I THINK THE THE

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:44.264
ISSUE IS THAT.

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:50.003
SAFETY IS A ONGOING PROCESS THAT

01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:54.107
IS -- PENETRATES THROUGH MANY

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:55.408
LAYERS.

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:58.779
AND YOU KNOW I THINK -- LIZA

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.413
BETTER REYES REALLY INTERESTING

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.615
POINT WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT WELL

01:47:01.681 --> 01:47:02.916
THE SAFETY THROUGH MANY

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:04.951
DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED

01:47:05.018 --> 01:47:05.519
WITH SAFETY THAT'S CERTAINLY

01:47:05.585 --> 01:47:09.723
TRUE -- BUT I THINK THAT --

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:12.726
SAFETY IS SPECIAL I MEAN SHE'S

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:13.293
RIGHT THERE YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.861
SEPARATE.

01:47:14.928 --> 01:47:16.129
ADVOCATE FOR SAFETY

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:17.464
ORGANIZATIONALLY AND THERE'S A

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:18.698
REASON FOR THAT AND PART OF IT

01:47:18.765 --> 01:47:21.835
IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SAFETY

01:47:21.902 --> 01:47:24.004
CULTURE IS INTERNALIZED IN

01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:26.306
INDIVIDUALS IT'S NOT A FORMAL

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:27.674
STRUCTURE.

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:30.010
IT PEOPLE INTERNALIZE IT AND IT

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:30.710
BECOMES SORT OF A COLLECTIVE

01:47:30.777 --> 01:47:31.578
GOOD.

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:32.779
AND RARELY DO YOU FIND

01:47:32.846 --> 01:47:35.248
INDIVIDUAL GROUPS ARGUING FOR A

01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:37.417
COLLECTIVE GOOD IT'S MOST OFTEN

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:39.186
A SPECIALIZED.

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:40.153
I I THINK YOU HAVE TO TREAT

01:47:40.220 --> 01:47:42.389
SAFETY IS SPECIAL AND I THINK

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:43.757
YOU WOULD ASO HAVE TO SAY.

01:47:43.824 --> 01:47:45.492
SAFETY ADVOCACY CAN'T BE JUST

01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:47.160
LIKE [inaudible]

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:49.629
RATE ADVOCACY.

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:50.964
RENEWABLE ADVOCACY IT'S A

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:52.799
SPECIAL PROPERTY.

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:55.969
AND SO -- WHEN WE'VE SEEN IT IN

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:57.737
OPERATION?

01:47:57.804 --> 01:47:59.506
IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:00.941
INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY OF PEOPLE

01:48:01.007 --> 01:48:04.411
WORKING IN SPECIFIC TASKS.

01:48:04.477 --> 01:48:06.580
WHO BASICALLY THINK ABOUT THE

01:48:06.646 --> 01:48:08.148
RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:10.417
DOING FOR OTHERS SYSTEM RISKS IN

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:12.152
AN ORGANIZATION?

01:48:12.219 --> 01:48:13.653
WHO AYE I WOULD USE THE USE THIS

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.921
EXAMPLE I WAS INTERVIEWING

01:48:14.988 --> 01:48:18.792
SOMEBODY A CHEMIST IN -- POWER

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:20.660
PLANT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:22.729
AND HE'S SITTING IN HIS OFFICE

01:48:22.796 --> 01:48:23.630
IN IS A NOISE IS WHAT IS THAT

01:48:23.697 --> 01:48:25.799
NOISE I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:26.399
HE RUSHES OUT OF THE ROOM AND

01:48:26.466 --> 01:48:27.567
LEAVES ME.

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:28.635
I'M JUST SITTING THERE ANY COMES

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:29.870
I HAD TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:31.605
HE COULD NOT BE THE PERSON HE

01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:33.573
WAS WITHOUT RUNNING OUT TO FIND

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.675
OUT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT WAS.

01:48:35.742 --> 01:48:38.411
AND SO THE IT'S IT'S A STATE OF

01:48:38.478 --> 01:48:41.014
MIND THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE FOR

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:42.215
THAT THAT'S THE CULTURE THE

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:44.251
DRIVE SAFETY EYES AND I BELIEVE

01:48:44.317 --> 01:48:45.919
IT GOES THROUGH ALL OF THE LIGHT

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:47.354
LAYERS WE CALL PEOPLE.

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.955
RELIABILITY PROFESSIONS WE SAW

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:50.624
THEM IN A LITTLE HUGE NUMBER OF

01:48:50.690 --> 01:48:51.458
INFRASTRUCTURES THAT WE LOOKED

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:53.627
AT WHO SAW.

01:48:53.693 --> 01:48:55.729
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:48:55.795 --> 01:48:58.231
RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AS BIGGER

01:48:58.298 --> 01:49:00.734
THAN THEIR JOB.

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.534
THEY WOULD GO BEYOND THEIR JOB.

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:03.069
THEY WOULD SEE A SYSTEM LEVEL

01:49:03.136 --> 01:49:04.571
RISK WHERE THEIR JOB DIDN'T CALL

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:05.739
FOR THEM TO EVEN.

01:49:05.805 --> 01:49:07.908
WORRY ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF RISKS

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:12.746
SO IT'S IT'S A PROCESS OF PEOPLE --

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:15.382
HAVING THIS IDENTIFICATION --

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:18.451
HAVING A RESTLESS.

01:49:18.518 --> 01:49:20.887
DRIVE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FROM

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:25.558
A SAFETY.

01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:26.526
THAT THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:28.328
EVERYTHING NEVER ALWAYS WORRIED

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:30.764
ABOUT BEING COMPLACENT.

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:34.301
AND THAT THAT KIND OF UP PROCESS.

01:49:34.367 --> 01:49:36.469
IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THE

01:49:36.536 --> 01:49:38.638
SAFETY CULTURE AND IT'S NOT EASY

01:49:38.705 --> 01:49:40.774
TO JUST CREATE THAT -- BUT

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.042
THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE SEE IT

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:44.444
SAFETY ISN'T JUST NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:46.313
AND NEW SYSTEMS IT'S THAT THAT

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:48.214
PROCESS AND THAT'S BEEN SO

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:49.215
DISTINCTIVE.

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:50.517
IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:52.585
WE'VE LOOKED AT SO.

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:55.322
AND THAT THAT THESE RELIABILITY

01:49:55.388 --> 01:49:57.590
PROFESSIONALS AS WE'D TURN COPS

01:49:57.657 --> 01:49:58.725
SAW BEYOND THEIR OWN

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.360
ORGANIZATIONS WE WENT TO THE

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:01.795
CONTRA COSTA WATER DISTRICT

01:50:01.861 --> 01:50:03.530
WHICH WAS FROM OUR STANDPOINT A

01:50:03.596 --> 01:50:05.432
REALLY WELL MANAGED HIGH

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:06.399
RELIABILITY UNIT.

01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:08.001
AND WHEN THEY STARTED TO TALK

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:10.136
ABOUT THEIR WATER PROCESSING

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:12.339
THEY SAW THROUGH THE LENS OF

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:13.974
THEIR CLIENTS.

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.508
IT WASN'T JUST WE GOT TO GET THE

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:17.043
STUFF OUT THERE THEY THOUGHT

01:50:17.110 --> 01:50:19.713
THIS IF WE SCREW UP HERE I KNOW

01:50:19.779 --> 01:50:20.347
WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO WITH THE

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:21.815
CITY OF X..

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:25.151
AND SO THE I DON'T KNOW QUITE.

01:50:25.218 --> 01:50:27.087
HOW YOU CREATE THAT BUT I JUST

01:50:27.153 --> 01:50:28.621
THINK IT'S DIFFERENT THAT'S WHY

01:50:28.688 --> 01:50:30.457
WHEN I THINK OF SAFETY ADVOCACY

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:31.424
I DON'T THINK OF IT IN THOSE

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:32.826
FORMAL TERMS I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:50:32.892 --> 01:50:35.428
PRODUCTIVE? TO ASSUME THAT THE

01:50:35.495 --> 01:50:37.230
OS A WILL SIMPLY COUNTER.

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:39.332
OTHER OTHER ADVOCATES FOR OTHER

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:41.134
THINGS IN PROCEEDINGS IF THIS IS

01:50:41.201 --> 01:50:42.502
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:44.070
UNDERSTOOD TO BE SPECIAL.

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:45.472
AND IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:46.906
ARE REALLY GOOD IT IS SPECIAL

01:50:46.973 --> 01:50:48.375
PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:50.343
WORRIED ABOUT.

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:52.345
THE HAZARDS THERE'S A PUBLIC

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.614
DREAD THAT THE MAKES THEM.

01:50:54.681 --> 01:50:57.350
YOU KNOW TAKE THIS ON BECAUSE OF

01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.119
THAT THAT KIND OF DREAD BUT UP

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:00.387
IN THE HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE

01:51:00.453 --> 01:51:02.555
FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE A UTILITY

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:05.025
AND AND IF FOR UTILITIES

01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:07.394
NEGLIGENT AND AND THE REGULATOR

01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:09.396
FINDS OUT FINDS THEM PUNISHES

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:11.531
THEM IN SOME WAY. FOR THE REST

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:15.568
OF YOUR AND AND AND CORRECTS

01:51:15.635 --> 01:51:17.337
THAT -- HE DID.

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:18.805
WOULD THAT IT HAS THAT LED TO A

01:51:18.872 --> 01:51:19.706
CAñADA LEAD.

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:20.607
TO KNOW KIND OF A DISTRUST IN

01:51:20.673 --> 01:51:22.375
AND A COMMUNICATION AND AND

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:23.843
TRUST ISSUE WILL THE THE

01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:25.578
REGULATOR ON NEVER FIND OUT IN

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:27.213
THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.249
NEVER GONNA TELL THEM WITH THE

01:51:29.315 --> 01:51:31.985
SAFETY IT FIND AND HOW I THINK I

01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:35.588
KNOW THAT IN THEIR EYES ARE OVAL

01:51:35.655 --> 01:51:36.022
THING OF THE FUTURE.

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:36.423
HE WAS.

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:37.624
WAS CRITICIZED FOR THE FACT THAT

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:38.758
THEY DID NOT FIND AND DID NOT

01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:39.726
TAKE IT SERIUSLYA NUMBER OF

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:40.693
YEARS AGO WITH THAT THAN THEY

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.063
WERE TRUST IN THE UTILITIES. TO

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.898
TO DO THE JOB FIND THE PROBLEM

01:51:44.964 --> 01:51:46.366
AND FIX THE PROBLEM REPORT THE

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:48.101
PROBLEM AND THEN YOU'RE OKAY AND

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:49.069
THE FINE DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK THE

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:51.738
FINE IS A PROCESS OF RETRIBUTIVE.

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.339
JUSTICE.

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:55.775
IT IS NOT A PROCESS OF RESTORED

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:57.143
INITIAL SOLVE THE PROBLEM

01:51:57.210 --> 01:52:00.380
TOGETHER.

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:02.482
AND MOST -- THE REGULATORS WERE

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:02.849
TALKING ABOUT.

01:52:02.916 --> 01:52:04.818
DON'T SEEM TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:06.386
WITH THEIR REGULATE PEOPLE I

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:07.987
WANT TO GO BACK IF YOU.

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:09.322
DON'T MIND THE SOMETHING YOU

01:52:09.389 --> 01:52:11.091
SAID ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO

01:52:11.157 --> 01:52:12.025
WHERE I THINK YOU SOLVE THE

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.160
PROBLEMS THAT WORK WE'RE TALKING

01:52:14.227 --> 01:52:14.961
ABOUT.

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:16.696
AND LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET A

01:52:16.763 --> 01:52:18.398
RIDE IF I DON'T GET A RIGHT TO

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:19.499
YOU CORRECT ME BACK HE SAID.

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:30.043
YEAH YOU NEED MORE RESOURCES

01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:30.577
THAT'S ONE THING. TO DO.

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:33.046
WHERE YOU ARE WHEN THE CPUC IS

01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:35.548
IT YOU HAVE TO SIGN BUT THE TELL

01:52:35.615 --> 01:52:36.683
SORRY?

01:52:36.749 --> 01:52:40.286
IN THEM.

01:52:40.353 --> 01:52:41.588
THE TWO WHERE THE BREAK COME OUT

01:52:41.654 --> 01:52:42.455
AND HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE DO THE

01:52:42.522 --> 01:52:43.823
MORE HAVE PEOPLE DO THEM WHO

01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:44.157
HAVE.

01:52:44.224 --> 01:52:45.692
A KNOWLEDGE THAT RELATES TO THE

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:47.260
OTHER GROUP GROUP BAY HAS NOT

01:52:47.327 --> 01:52:49.195
ONLY TO RELEASE TO BE OR

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:52.932
WHATEVER BUT YOU NEED TO DEVELOP --

01:52:52.999 --> 01:52:55.168
AT IT WELL INVOICE AVOIDING

01:52:55.235 --> 01:52:57.570
CONFLICT AND ENCOURAGING

01:52:57.637 --> 01:53:01.341
INTERDEPENDENCE I THINK THAT'S

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:02.308
WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY.

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.977
IN NOT THAT QUITE LANGUAGE BUT

01:53:04.043 --> 01:53:06.746
IS NOT YOUR LAST DISCUSSION BUT

01:53:06.813 --> 01:53:08.114
THE ONE BEFORE THAT.

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:10.517
IN EVERY ORGANIZATION THAT'S

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:12.886
GOING TO BE -- SAFE.

01:53:12.952 --> 01:53:14.621
THAT'S SO THEY NEED TO DO.

01:53:14.687 --> 01:53:15.688
IT AM I AYE.

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:18.958
IF YOU DON'T MIND I USE THAT MY

01:53:19.025 --> 01:53:20.059
NEXT PAPER.

01:53:20.126 --> 01:53:21.327
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD REALLY

01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:23.296
SAID LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S

01:53:23.363 --> 01:53:26.833
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE REGULATOR

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:28.268
AND THE REGULATE TV.

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:29.903
YOU DON'T NEED NEED TO DO IN

01:53:29.969 --> 01:53:31.371
THIS ALL KINDS OF REGULATIONS

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:32.839
THERE'S REGULAR I'VE WATCHED A

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:34.007
LOT OF REGULATION THE MILITARY

01:53:34.073 --> 01:53:35.275
THAT NO ONE WOULD CALL

01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:36.543
REGULATION.

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:38.344
BUT THAT THEY DO CALL PROBLEM

01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:40.079
SOLVING.

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:42.182
AND SO I IT'S I FOR THAT DAY I

01:53:42.248 --> 01:53:43.716
GET ARE FOR RIGHT THERE AND

01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:44.684
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU NEED TO

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:46.419
DO FROM THERE WHAT EVERYBODY

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:47.954
NEEDS.

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:48.955
TO FIND THAT THE TASK.

01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:54.561
FIND THE ONES THAT THE MIX A

01:53:54.627 --> 01:53:56.663
LITTLE BIT -- IF YOU GOT THE

01:53:56.729 --> 01:53:58.231
RIGHT PLAYERS THAT'S ALWAYS A

01:53:58.298 --> 01:54:01.601
PROBLEM ARM IN THEM -- WORRY

01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:03.203
ABOUT WHAT WHETHER YOU GOT THREE

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:04.437
ORGANIZATIONS OR ONE

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.372
ORGANIZATION OR HALF AN ORGAN IT

01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:07.307
DOESN'T MATTER.

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:09.475
BUT WORRY ABOUT PUTTING THOSE

01:54:09.542 --> 01:54:13.646
TASKS INTO A MIX WHERE YOU HAVE --

01:54:13.713 --> 01:54:17.884
ABILITY TO AGREE IT IN A SET OF

01:54:17.951 --> 01:54:20.320
TAX EL AND THE DESIRE TO

01:54:20.386 --> 01:54:25.158
INTEGRATE AMONG ALL OF THEM.

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:25.792
AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHAT

01:54:25.858 --> 01:54:27.293
THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.162
IS BUT IF YOU DESIGN A CULTURE

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:30.663
WITH THE PUNITIVE ASPECT LIKE

01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:33.600
THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED.

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:34.901

I AM VERY RAPIDLY YOU HAVE A OWN.

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:48.815
SURE AND THE I AGREE WITH THE

YEAH I I'M NOT I'M NOT EXACTLY

01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:58.558
SURE IF THAT WAS A SO YOU DON'T

01:54:58.625 --> 01:54:59.626
WOULD THOUGH BUT I SAID

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:00.893
PREVIOUSLY BUT I THINK AT THE

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.631
LINES SO WITH THE WITH THIS

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:05.732
BEING THE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:08.668

I THINK WE HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN

01:58:39.145 --> 01:58:41.814
IN SCHOOL THESE DIFFERENT AREAS

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.182

AUDITS OF THE UTILITY SYSTEM FOR

SAFETY AND SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:04.003
THE WATER DIVISION THAT JUST

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:05.972
DOESN'T RATE MAKING FOR WATER

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:08.374
RATES LIKE THEY'RE GONNA HAVDE

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:10.476
YOU THOSE YES SAFETY SHOULD BE

01:59:10.543 --> 01:59:11.777
ON TOP OF EVERYBODY'S MIND.

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:13.613
BUT WHAT WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO

01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:16.649
DO IS VERY DIFFERENT RATE AND I

01:59:16.716 --> 01:59:17.750

I A CANDLE SET A DATE I FIND IT

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:24.357
USEFUL TO BREAK THIS QUESTION

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:33.132
DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE AND NOT

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:35.701
TALK ABOUT IT JUST AS A SORT OF

01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:38.004
AGENCY ON COMPANY LEVEL.

01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:38.804

KNOW SEPARATING SAFETY OUT OF

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:45.645
THE FEW SEE INTO A SEPARATE.

01:59:55.388 --> 01:59:55.888
WORK.

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:57.723
AND WHETHER THEY WOULD BE

01:59:57.790 --> 02:00:00.293
MARGINALIZED IN SOME WAY OR OR

02:00:00.359 --> 02:00:03.429
IGNORED OR JUST WOULDN'T BE.

GOOD POINTS ABOUT.

02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:20.012
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CREATE A

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:22.248
DIFFERENT EDGE AS A SEPARATE

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:23.583

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:03.903
I THINK THE ISSUE WITH YOU KNOW

02:04:03.969 --> 02:04:05.838
THE HOME ADVOCATING FOR SAFETY

02:04:05.905 --> 02:04:07.072
WITHIN THE PC AND SORT OF

02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:08.307
PROMOTING THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:10.776
SYSTEM WHILE BEING AN OUTSIDE

02:04:10.843 --> 02:04:12.444
AND CITY THAT DOESN'T REPORT TO

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.246
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:15.815
YOU KNOW YOU CREATE THIS WAY FOR

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:17.783
CREATION OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT

02:04:17.850 --> 02:04:19.185
YOU KNOW IF THEY RECOMMEND

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:20.953
CERTAIN MEASURES FOR THE PC TO

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:21.954
TAKE.

02:04:22.021 --> 02:04:23.355
IN THE PC THAN THE HOUSE TWO

02:04:23.422 --> 02:04:25.224
OPTIONS RIGHT THE EITHER JUST

02:04:25.291 --> 02:04:27.259
DOES EXACTLY WHAT THE ALWAYS SAY

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:28.427
SAYS.

02:04:28.494 --> 02:04:30.362
AND THEN THINGS STILL GO BAD THE

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:32.198
PC WILL GOAL WHAT.

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:33.566
WAS THEY TOLD US DO IT WILL WIN

02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:37.002
DOING WHATEVER WE BEING TOLD SO.

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:38.070
YOU KNOW IT'S THEIR FAULT.

02:04:38.137 --> 02:04:41.140
OR THEY DECIDE TO SORT OF ACT

02:04:41.207 --> 02:04:50.382
DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT WAS SAY IS

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:52.218
SUGGESTING.

02:04:52.284 --> 02:04:53.485
RATE BUT THEN YOUR AGAIN YOUR

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:54.687
SEVERAL WHO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

02:04:54.753 --> 02:04:55.855
HAVE ISSUES WHEN YOU WANT TO

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:57.289
KNOW LIKE WHAT IS THE AGENCY

02:04:57.356 --> 02:04:58.057
DOING AND WHO DO YOU POINTS WAS

02:04:58.123 --> 02:04:59.992
BEING REALLY RESPONSIBLE YOU THE

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:01.093
KIND OF DON'T KNOW OLD KIND OF

02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:02.027
WHERE TO GO.

02:05:02.094 --> 02:05:05.130
SO YOU THINK. ZERO ALSO THE YOU

02:05:05.197 --> 02:05:06.398
CAN MAKE IT WORK BOTH WAYS BUT I

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:07.600
WOULD KIND OF KEEP GOING BACK TO

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:08.200
WHICH FUNCTIONS WITH TALKING

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:09.001
ABOUT BEING OUTSIDE OF THE

02:05:09.068 --> 02:05:10.436
COMMISSION AND WHAT PROBLEM DO

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.571
WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT.

02:05:12.638 --> 02:05:12.938
SORT OF SOULS.

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.139
OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU I CAN

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:16.408
THINK OF A ONE ONE AWARD YEAH

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:16.775
OKAY.

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:18.043
QUICKLY FIND WHAT ONE ONE MODEL

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:18.677
THAT MIGHT WORK.

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:22.348
AN INDEPENDENT SAFETY A UTILITY

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:23.515
SAFETY BOARD.

02:05:23.582 --> 02:05:24.683
OR ADVISORY BOARD WHATEVER YOU

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:25.484
WANNA CALL IT THAT HAS

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:27.453
RECOGNIZED EXPERTS SINCE IN

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:29.188
SAFETY AND A STAFF.

02:05:29.255 --> 02:05:30.656
THAT TAKES OVER THE RESEARCH AND

02:05:30.723 --> 02:05:32.258
ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS LOOKS AT THE

02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:33.859
LITERATURE TRANSLATES INTO

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:36.428
REGULATORY FRAMES OF REFERENCE

02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:37.630
THAT ARE USEFUL.

02:05:37.696 --> 02:05:39.899
AND ADDS ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:41.600
THAT THE UC MIGHT THINK ARTS OR

02:05:41.667 --> 02:05:43.402
THE PUBLIC THINKS ARE REALLY

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:44.570
IMPORTANT THEY WOULD DO.

02:05:44.637 --> 02:05:45.938
HIRE PEOPLE IF NECESSARY IF THEY

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:47.139
DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN STAFF TO DO

02:05:47.206 --> 02:05:49.041
IT THE ACTION INVESTIGATIONS AND

02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:50.643
THAT.

02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:52.878
THEY WOULD REPORT THESE THINGS --

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:55.848
AND THEY WOULD MAKE AT TIMES.

02:05:55.915 --> 02:05:58.550
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY TO

02:05:58.617 --> 02:06:00.319
THE PC.

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:02.554
I SEE TO BENEFITS OF THIS ONE IS

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:04.390
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BURDEN THE PC

02:06:04.456 --> 02:06:05.557
WITH ADDING YET ANOTHER FUNCTION

02:06:05.624 --> 02:06:07.626
WHICH IT'S NOT DOING VERY WELL

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.561
NOW AND RESEARCH AND THEY COULD

02:06:09.628 --> 02:06:11.630
DO IT SEPARATELY AND HAVE A LOT

02:06:11.697 --> 02:06:13.699
OF PRESTIGE ABOUT DOING THAT.

02:06:13.766 --> 02:06:16.669
FUNCTION AT THEIR LEVEL OF SKILL.

02:06:16.735 --> 02:06:19.605
AND THE THE POLICY ADVICE THEY

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:22.174
GIVE TO THE PC FOR REGULATIONS

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:23.876
OR WHATEVER OTHER POLICIES.

02:06:23.943 --> 02:06:25.411
WOULD HAVE SOME WEIGHT.

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:27.980
AND WHAT I SEE IS THIS WOULD

02:06:28.047 --> 02:06:29.515
GIVE A LOT OF POLITICAL COVER.

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:31.083
TO THE PC WHICH IS CURRENTLY

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:32.451
DOESN'T HAVE NOW BECAUSE WILL

02:06:32.518 --> 02:06:32.952
DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.687
COMPETENCE NECESSARILY WITH

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:35.788
RESPECT TO SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:06:35.854 --> 02:06:37.056
ITS INVOLVEMENT.

02:06:37.122 --> 02:06:38.857
IT WOULD GIVE POLITICAL AND

02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:40.492
PUBLIC PRESTIGE.

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:42.127
IF THE P. YOU SEE DECIDE OKAY ON

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.595
THE BASIS OF THE RECOMMENDATION

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:45.864
OF THIS ADVISORY BOARD WE HAVE

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:47.099
DECIDED TO ADOPT THIS.

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.467
PARTICULAR.

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:53.806
RULE OR REGULATION OR WHATEVER --

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:56.041
AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.476
POSSIBLE I COULD SEE THAT

02:06:57.543 --> 02:06:59.411
HAPPENING WITHOUT DEGRADING THE

02:06:59.478 --> 02:07:01.680
OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE UC.

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.916
AND ACTUALLY ADDING SOMETHING TO

02:07:03.983 --> 02:07:05.150
A PRECARIOUS.

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:07.386
POLITICAL SITUATION THEY

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:10.322
CURRENTLY FIND THEMSELVES.

02:07:10.389 --> 02:07:11.357
THANK YOU FOR THAT IN

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:11.657
[inaudible]

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:16.095
AND THIS ISN'T BEEN -- VERY

02:07:16.161 --> 02:07:17.363
INFORMATIVE.

TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TODAY AND I

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.302

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:24.636
WATCHING ON THE CAMERAS AND

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:27.106
ELSEWHERE HAVE IS IS WELL -- WE

BEST KIND OF DIFFICULT QUESTIONS

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:30.743
TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF

02:07:30.809 --> 02:07:32.311
OUR JOB TO DO THAT AND IF TRYING

02:07:32.378 --> 02:07:34.279

PROCESS.

02:07:37.983 --> 02:07:39.752
QUESTIONS IT RAISES AS A CALL TO

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.887
