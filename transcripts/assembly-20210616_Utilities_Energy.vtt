THEIR DEFINITION OF GREEN

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:56.333
HYDROGEN IS TOO LIMITED. FOR

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.168
ONE IT WAS JUST SOLAR AND WIND

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.137
FOR THE OTHER WITH SOLAR WIND.

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:03.407
GEOTHERMAL AND HYDRO I DO THINK

00:49:03.473 --> 00:49:05.242
BIOENERGY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:07.210
ARMED I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.845
THEIR RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:11.381
CONSIDER DIRTY FOSSIL FUEL

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:13.250
MAKING HYDROGEN GREEN HYDROGEN

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.886
AYE. I DON'T EVEN THINK WE HAVE

00:49:15.952 --> 00:49:18.455
TO MENTION THAT- THE AUTHOR

00:49:18.522 --> 00:49:20.991

WAS STILL IN MY DISTRICT THAT-

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:58.195
IF THEY WERE VERY EXCITED TO

00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:00.564
DEMONSTRATE THEIR- HYDROGEN

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:03.066
MIRAI AND- THEY WERE SO EXCITED

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:05.435
THAT YOU KNOW THE EXHAUST THE

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:07.037
ONLY THING THAT WOULD BE COMING

HYDROGEN COLOR WHEEL YOU KNOW

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.687
THE WHOLE ANALYSIS AS TO HOW.

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:26.022
CLEAN OR HOW DURING THE PROCESS

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:28.058
IS IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCTION.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:31.461
OF THE HYDROGEN FUEL. I WANTED

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.096
TO THE SATURDAY KNOW THAT THE

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:35.565
THAT THE CHILDREN NINE I DON'T

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:36.166
KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT THE

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:38.301
WE HAD THE- LEAD TO A

00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:40.170
DELEGATION OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.406

UNFORTUNATELY NOW IS. YOU KNOW

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:54.151
SO MUCH OF IT IS BECOMING A

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.051
NUCLEAR WASTELAND BUT- THEY'RE

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.186
CERTAINLY TRYING TO CREATE THAT

00:50:56.253 --> 00:50:57.320
AS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THEY

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:59.256
THEY- DEMONSTRATED THIS THEY

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:00.791
THEY HAVE THIS HYDROGEN.

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:01.892
DEMONSTRATION PLANNED WITH A

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:05.462
USE ALL SOLAR. TO PRODUCE-

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:08.331
GREEN ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN-

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.867
AND THEY WORK SHOWCASING HOW

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:12.135
THEY WANTED TO USE A NOT ONLY

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:14.838
AN- TRANSPORTATION NOT ONLY

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.139

HOPEFULLY NOT GOING TO. BE LEFT

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:33.356
BEHIND BUT- IS GOING TO BE PART

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:34.991
OF THIS THIS IS A VERY.

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:36.760
EXCITING GOOD A TECHNOLOGY THAT

AND SO. ON I WANT TO ASK YOU

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.639
THOUGH. IF YOU'RE IT'S MY

00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:50.707
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.342
ORIGINAL BILL WAS PROPOSING A

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:59.382
DIFFERENT TO LIMIT THE USE OF A-

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:02.652
HYDROGEN- TO BE CONSIDERED IN

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:05.055
THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.690
THE I. R. P. AND FUTURE ENERGY

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:08.925

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:11.628
BASED ON YOUR- EXPERIENCE AND

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:12.762
UNDERSTANDING THAT GREEN

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:15.465
HYDROLYTIC AND HYDROGEN IS IN

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:20.270
FACT. THE ONLY ASSURED- GREEN

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:25.075
RENEWABLE- HYDROGEN FUEL.

00:52:25.141 --> 00:52:27.544
THROUGH THEIR THIS ARM THANK

00:52:27.611 --> 00:52:28.912
YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:31.681
QUESTION SO AND I WILL TRY TO

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.818
BE BRIEF- OBVIOUSLY CALIFORNIA

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.953
STARTED TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.222
HYDROGEN BACK IN THE EARLY TWO

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:42.192
THOUSANDS BUT AT THAT POINT WE

00:52:42.259 --> 00:52:43.360
THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

00:52:43.426 --> 00:52:44.528
AVAILABLE IN THE PRODUCTION

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:46.263
PROCESS WERE PRIMARILY USING

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:48.498
FOSSIL FUELS AND IN FACT THE

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:50.133
CARBON PROFILE PARTRIDGE IN AT

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.768
THAT TIME WAS NOT SOMETHING I

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.336
THINK THOSE OF US WHO REALLY

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.205
WANT TO DECARBONISE WOULD BE

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:57.674
WOULD HAVE ADVOCATE. BUT

00:52:57.741 --> 00:52:59.809
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW TECHNOLOGIES

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.578
IMPROVE A LOT TO RESEARCH

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:04.481
INVESTMENTS AND WE NOW KNOW WE

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.516
NOT ONLY DO WE KNOW THERE IS A

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:08.318
PART OF IT WAS COST IT IS

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.554
BECOMING MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.955
PRODUCE HYDROGEN THROUGH OTHER

00:53:12.022 --> 00:53:14.190
MEANS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:17.727
HAVE WE HAVE- MADE SUCH HUGE

00:53:17.794 --> 00:53:20.864
INVESTMENTS IN SOLAR AND WIND

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.999
AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES. AT

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.368
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AT TIMES

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.470
OVER PRODUCTION SO THAT WE CAN

00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:28.605
AFFORD TO USE THAT TO PRODUCE

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:30.440
HYDROGEN NOW IS POINTED OUT BY

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.375
OUR COLLEAGUE DR CORK THERE ARE

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:35.812
OTHER WAYS TO PRODUCE NON BROWN

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:39.382
OR NON CARBON HYDROGEN AND SO

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:41.484
JUST STEPPING BACK IN TWENTY

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:43.019
NINETEEN I CARRIED BILL AND WE

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:43.887
GAVE A DEFINITION TO GREEN

00:53:43.954 --> 00:53:45.622
ELECTRIC HYBRID ELECTROLYTIC

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.624
HYDROGEN THAT DEFINITION STANCE

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.392
WE HAVE A STATUTORY DEFINITION

00:53:49.459 --> 00:53:50.393
FOR GREEN ELECTROLYTIC

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.764
HYDROGEN. NOW IF WE DO NOT OR

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:57.434
IF WE FOR PURPOSES OF SAY THIS

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.904
BILL ARE UNABLE TO LAND ON A

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.473
BROADER DEFINITION THEN IN

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:05.308
EFFECT THE STATUTORY DEFINITION

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.277
THAT EXISTS IS THE ONE THE

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:09.613
GREEN ELECTROLYTIC SO FOR THOSE

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:11.314
WHO ARE REALLY CONCERNED THAT

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:12.482
WE MAY GO IN A DIRECTION THAT

00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:14.584
WOULD BE NOT GREAT FOR CARBON

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:15.919
THEY DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:19.856
THAT AT THIS MOMENT YEAH. WE

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.658
UNDERTOOK AN EFFORT TO COME UP

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:25.228
WITH. THE DEFINITION INVOLVING

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:26.329
A LOT OF STICKLE- SO WE JUST

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:27.097
HAVE ONLY YET YOU KNOW THINGS

00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:28.031
ARE TRICKY. SO WE'LL KEEP

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.600
TALKING. AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST-

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.535
BUT FOR THE MOMENT I THINK WE

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.337
ARE QUITE SAFE THOSE OF US WHO

00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:36.339
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CARBON

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:38.475
SIDE OF IT. TO STILL PROCEED

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.243
BUT THIS ADDITIONALLY DOES NOT

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.445
LIMIT OUR AGENCIES FROM

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.080
PLANNING NOTICE THAT THIS IS

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:47.217
PLANNING. FROM PLANNING ON HOW

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:49.452
TO UTILIZE. THE HYDROGEN ON A

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:51.621
BROADER WAY SHOULD WE BE AT A

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:54.524
PLACE WHERE WE EITHER COME WITH

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:56.660
A GREAT DEFINITION OR LAND ON A

00:54:56.726 --> 00:55:00.063
WAY TO. TO ACT- PRODUCE EXTRACT

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.965
WHATEVER HYDROGEN IN ADDITIONAL

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:05.468
WAYS THAT ARE LOW TO NO CARB SO

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:08.271
THAT'S WHY I AM COMFORTABLE

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.873
WITH HOW WE ARE PROCEEDING.

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:13.109

A YEAR TWO YEARS FROM NOW ABOUT

THE NEED FOR THE P. YOU SEE. TO

ADDED HYDROGEN AS PART OF A

00:55:43.707 --> 00:55:44.941
STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH IS

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.242

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.692
TIMES WHEN THERE IS A

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.727
DISCONNECT WITH THE CPC. FOR

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:15.296
INSTANCE WHEN THE CPUC DOES NOT

01:37:15.362 --> 01:37:17.965
ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:20.301

YOUR VOICE IS MISSING. FROM

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:28.642
THAT DIALOGUE WE SUFFER.

01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:29.677
ADDITIONALLY WHEN THE

01:37:29.743 --> 01:37:31.679
LEGISLATURE PASSES A MEASURE.

01:37:31.745 --> 01:37:34.081
THAT PROVIDES CLEAR DIRECTION

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:36.383
EXPECTATIONS TO THE CPUC. BUT

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:37.618
THEN AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:39.453
THAT MEASURE THOSE DIRECTIVES

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.556
ARE NORD THAT ALSO ROADS THE

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:48.996

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:13.854
IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE GET

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:17.391
PUBLIC INPUT FROM THE CPSC TO

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:19.493

LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVES- AND I

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:11.038

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.542
OPEN RELATIONSHIP. AND I AM

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.177
JOHN I HAVE ENJOYED THAT WITH

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:18.112
OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

01:40:18.178 --> 01:40:19.513
LEGISLATURE BOTH THIS COMMITTEE

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:22.316
AND OTHERS SO I APOLOGIZE

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:24.351
PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:27.888
ON BEHALF OF THE CPUC FOR-

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:30.557
ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE IGNORED

01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:33.127
OR IN ANY COMMUNICATION THAT WE

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.795

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:35.963
SAID I WILL DO EVERYTHING

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:39.099
CORRECT THAT AND I APOLOGIZE TO

01:40:39.166 --> 01:40:40.300
YOU MISTER CHAIR. WHAT IT NO

01:40:40.367 --> 01:40:41.902
APOLOGY NECESSARY WE LOOK

01:40:41.969 --> 01:40:43.670
FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:44.671
THE RELATIONSHIP AND AS YOU

01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:46.673
SAY. WE HAVE A VERY GOOD ONE

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:50.411
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO- US

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:52.279
COLLABORATING BUT IT WAS THAT

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:53.947
SIMPLE GIVEN THE NATURE OF THIS

01:40:54.014 --> 01:40:55.115
HEARING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:57.985
THAT- AND IT'S NOT JUST.

01:40:58.051 --> 01:41:00.988
ANYTHING NECESSARILY NOW IT IS

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:02.489
SORT OF INSTITUTIONAL AND

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:04.892
SYSTEMIC THROUGH THE CPC OVER

01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:06.794
AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.195
THERE ALSO BEEN MORE RECENT

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:10.330
ISSUES AROUND DIRECT ACCESS AND

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:12.699
LEGISLATION THAT WAS ADDRESSING

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:15.169
DIRECT ACCESS AND HOW. SOME OF

01:41:15.235 --> 01:41:16.437
THE THINGS THAT WERE CALLED FOR

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:17.604
WERE NOT NECESSARILY

01:41:17.671 --> 01:41:19.540
IMPLEMENTED OUT OF THE ACTION

01:41:19.606 --> 01:41:20.741
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN REGARDS

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:23.510
TO THAT. PARTICULAR BILL AND-

01:41:23.577 --> 01:41:24.878
THERE BEEN OTHER INSTANCES I

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:26.847
THINK THAT OTHERS. MAY HAVE

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:28.482
THEIR OWN PARTICULAR.

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:30.984
REMEMBRANCES OF THAT- THEY THEY

01:41:31.051 --> 01:41:32.586
CARRY WITH THEM BUT I DO THINK

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:35.222
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. AS

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:37.191
WE'RE BOTH PUBLIC INTO ENTITIES

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:39.159
THAT WE HAVE THE CONVERSATIONS

01:41:39.226 --> 01:41:42.029
IN A WAY WHERE. WE'VE HEARD

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:43.430
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME SOME OF

01:41:43.497 --> 01:41:45.432
THE CONCERNS WELL WE HEAR

01:41:45.499 --> 01:41:47.501
OFTEN. SOME OF THE CONCERNS IN

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:49.770
TERMS OF THE SLOW. MOVEMENT

01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:51.171
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:53.540
TERMS OF TRYING TO CHANGE IT TO

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:54.842
THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY BUT I

01:41:54.908 --> 01:41:56.076
THINK THAT THERE CONTINUES TO

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:57.911
BE SOME. QUESTIONS OUT THERE

01:41:57.978 --> 01:41:59.246
AND AREAS THAT WE NEED TO

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.215
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON SO WE LOOK

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:01.949
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

01:42:02.015 --> 01:42:03.617
PARTNER WITH YOU. IN YOUR

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.586
ENDEAVORS IN YOUR EFFORT TO

ADDRESS THOSE THOSE KIND OF

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.089
ISSUES. ARE GOING TO TURN TO A

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:13.627

TO HER- PREVIOUS SERVICE IN OUR

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:36.016
STATE GOVERNMENT- IT IS. IT IS

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:40.654
UNFORTUNATE- TO ECHO THE EXACT

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:41.288
SAME EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH ONE

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:44.658
OF MY- PIECES OF LEGISLATION.

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:46.727
THAT WAS- DEALING WITH ENERGY

01:42:46.793 --> 01:42:50.864
EFFICIENCY- TRYING TO. FIND

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:53.534
USES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.801
MONEY WHICH THE UTILITIES

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:57.037
CHARGE US THE RATEPAYERS WHICH

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:59.439
WE PAY FOR. AND UNFORTUNATELY

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:01.909
CONTINUES OVER TIME TO NOT BE

01:43:01.975 --> 01:43:03.477
SPENT IN MORE TALK ABOUT HOW

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:05.879
MUCH IS NOT BEING SPENT WE'RE

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:09.816
TALKING UPWARDS OF. COULD BE

01:43:09.883 --> 01:43:10.350
FIFTY TO ALMOST A HUNDRED

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:12.719
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF AGAIN

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:14.421
RATEPAYER MONEY WHICH IS BEING

01:43:14.488 --> 01:43:16.423
USED FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AT

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.825
A TIME WHEN WE'VE HAD TO SHUT

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:20.794
OFF OUR POWER BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:22.796
HAVE ENOUGH POWER- IN THE

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:28.669
STATE- IN YET YOUR AGENCY- SEEM

01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:31.338
TO FEEL MORE IN I MEAN I JUST I

01:43:31.405 --> 01:43:32.573
DON'T BELIEVE THIS REFLECTIVE

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:34.741
OF YOUR FEELINGS. MADAM CHAIR

01:43:34.808 --> 01:43:38.045
BUT MORE THE AGENCIES HOW- THE

01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:41.815
AGENCIES SEEM TO FEEL LIKE THIS

01:43:41.882 --> 01:43:42.382
WAS THEIR MONEY NOT THE RATE

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:45.085
PAYERS MONEY- IT SEEMS TO BE A

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:48.922
VERY UNFORTUNATE. THAT RATHER

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:52.392
THAN. FIGURING OUT HOW WE COULD

01:43:52.459 --> 01:43:55.295
DEPLOY THIS MONEY. INTO ITS

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:56.797
INTENDED PURPOSE WHICH WAS

01:43:56.863 --> 01:44:00.067
ENERGY EFFICIENCY- IT BECAME A

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:02.536
POLITICAL TURF WAR. WHICH TO ME

01:44:02.603 --> 01:44:04.304
IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.173
APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THE

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:10.544
AGENCY. OR FRANKLY IS IT IS A

01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:12.479
WASTE OF TIME FOR ALL OF US

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:14.848
WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:16.917
ENERGY TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON.

01:44:16.984 --> 01:44:19.720
AND WE COULD DEFINITELY USE-

01:44:19.786 --> 01:44:22.155
SMARTLY- ENERGY EFFICIENCY

01:44:22.222 --> 01:44:23.557
RESOURCES DEPLOYED AROUND THE

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:25.325
STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:26.493
PRECIOUS ENERGY THAT WE DOOR

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.595
PRODUCING IS BEING USED AS

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:32.499
EFFICIENTLY. AS POSSIBLE- SO I

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:36.269
WOULD REALLY URGE YOU AS YOU

01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:37.771
HAVE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT JOB

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:38.939
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:40.707
THE JOB THIS IS MY OFFICE IS

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:41.308
JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM YOUR

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:44.845
OFFICE- OF REALLY. TURNING

01:44:44.911 --> 01:44:47.481
AROUND. THIS AGENCY THAT THE

01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:50.617
AGENCY. IS NOT THERE TO SERVE

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:53.553
ITSELF BUT TO REALLY SERVE THE

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:54.154
RATE PAYERS AND THE PEOPLE OF

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:56.690
THE STATE. AND THAT AS IT'S

01:44:56.757 --> 01:45:00.661
TASKED WITH OVERSEEING FUNDS

01:45:00.727 --> 01:45:03.296
THAT CLEARLY HAVEN'T BEEN USED

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:07.034
FOR WHATEVER REASON- IF THE

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.835
AGENCY CAN'T SOMEHOW FIGURE

01:45:08.902 --> 01:45:11.038
OUT. HOW TO DEPLOY THESE

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:13.106
RESOURCES THAT I'D WISH THEY'D

01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:14.574
GET OUT OF THE WAY THE

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:15.175
LEGISLATURE AS WE ARE ABLE TO

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:18.679
DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT IS-

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:20.447
WHAT I JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE

01:45:20.514 --> 01:45:22.549
OF WHAT THE CHAIR IS TALKING

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.050
ABOUT JUST BE VERY VERY

01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:26.019
SPECIFIC. IT WAS- EXTREMELY

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:29.256
DISAPPOINTING- INTERACTION BUT

01:45:29.322 --> 01:45:31.358
UNFORTUNATELY HAS BEEN

01:45:31.425 --> 01:45:33.660
INDICATIVE OF MY EXPERIENCE. IN

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:36.329
WORKING WITH THE- WITH YOUR

01:45:36.396 --> 01:45:38.465
AGENCY IT PREDATES YOU. PRE

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:40.867
DATES SHARE PICKER- YOU KNOW

01:45:40.934 --> 01:45:42.769
AND GOES BACK TO EVEN CHECK

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.638
TV'S TIMES I DON'T I DON'T LOOK

01:45:44.705 --> 01:45:48.341
AT IT AS- A REFLECTION OF-

01:45:48.408 --> 01:45:49.976
REALLY ANY OF THE COMMISSIONERS

01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:52.612
IN ESSENCE BUT- UNFORTUNATELY

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:55.248
MORE OF A REFLECTION. OF THE

01:45:55.315 --> 01:45:56.983
CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.385
WHICH I KNOW YOU HAVE A

01:45:58.452 --> 01:45:59.052
CHALLENGE TO TRY AND TURN

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:03.056
AROUND. BURKE IT IS MY HOPE.

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.958
THAT AS YOU HAVE BEEN

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:06.126
SUCCESSFUL IN TURNING AROUND

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:08.028
OTHER AGENCIES THAT YOU ALSO BE

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:08.829
ABLE TO TURN AROUND THIS

01:46:08.895 --> 01:46:11.965
AGENCY. BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS.

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:15.335
LOST TRACK OF ITS MISSION. AND

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:18.071
LOST TRACK OF WHOM IT IS

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:21.041
SUPPOSED TO SERVE. AND SO I

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:24.745
JUST IMPLORE YOU. TO KNOW THAT

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:28.048
AS YOU PUSH AND MAKE CHANGES AS

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:29.850
YOU'VE DONE IN SO MANY OF OTHER

01:46:29.916 --> 01:46:32.085
AGENCIES IN YOUR CAPACITIES TO

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:34.521
ENSURE THAT THE COMMISSION IS

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:35.622
SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THE

01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:38.091
STATE. THAT I MYSELF AM VERY

01:46:38.158 --> 01:46:40.193
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND WILL BE

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:42.262
SUPPORTIVE OF CHANGES AS YOU

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:45.699
CHOOSE TO MAKE THEM TO ENSURE

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:47.400
THAT THE COMMISSION HAS THAT

01:46:47.467 --> 01:46:49.102
MISSION AT HEART. THAT IS

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:51.772
ENSURING THAT RATEPAYER MONEY

01:46:51.838 --> 01:46:52.906
IS GOING TO WHERE IT'S INTENDED

01:46:52.973 --> 01:46:55.242
TO GO RATHER THAN SITTING

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:57.544
AROUND GATHERING DUST WHEN HE

01:46:57.611 --> 01:47:00.080
NEEDS TO BE CRITICALLY DEPLOYED

01:47:00.147 --> 01:47:00.981
SO WITH THAT I JUST THINK THE

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:02.949
CHAIR FOR HIS OPENING COMMENTS

01:47:03.016 --> 01:47:03.717
BECAUSE I THINK THEY ARE VERY

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.886
REFLECTIVE. OF THE MINDSET OF

01:47:05.952 --> 01:47:09.489
NOT ONLY THIS COMMITTEE BUT

01:47:09.556 --> 01:47:09.956
REALLY OUR OUR ENTIRE

FIRST OF ALL IT'S MY

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:31.278
UNDERSTANDING THAT- THE. THE

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:35.582
BASIC LESSON THAT- I. BELIEVE

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:38.885
THEY THE PC HAS ADMITTED TO

01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:40.420
LEARNING FROM LAST YEAR'S

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:44.724
ROLLING BLACKOUTS. WAS THAT-

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:48.395
THE- RELEVANT AGENCIES THE P.

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:50.463
C. THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE I

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:53.700
ALSO DID NOT SUFFICIENTLY PLAN

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:56.736
FOR THE EXTREME HEAT. ARM IS

01:47:56.803 --> 01:48:02.475
ACT IS THAT CORRECT. MEMBER YES

01:48:02.542 --> 01:48:05.579
WE- DIDN'T THE THREE OF US

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:09.816
KALISTO CC AND CPUC-

01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:14.254
INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY-

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:15.121
IF YOU ARE A ROOT CAUSE

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.623
ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THERE WERE

01:48:16.690 --> 01:48:19.059
SEVERAL THINGS THAT FRANKLY WE

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:22.295
NEEDED TO DO BETTER AND- THEY

01:48:22.362 --> 01:48:25.398
WERE BOTH- THE ENERGY DEMAND

01:48:25.465 --> 01:48:26.266
FORECASTING WHICH I THINK

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:27.901
YOU'RE REFERRING TO INTO IN

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:29.636
TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION.

01:48:29.703 --> 01:48:31.004
RESOURCE PLANNING AND

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:33.373
CONTINGENCY CONTINGENCY PLAN

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:35.242
INCLUDING DEVELOPING A BETTER

01:48:35.308 --> 01:48:37.410
UNDERSTANDING OF OUR SUPPLY

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:38.678
SIDE TRENDS IN NEIGHBORING

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:40.347
STATES AND HOW THIS WILL

01:48:40.413 --> 01:48:43.516
IMPACT- CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS TO

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:46.786
IMPORTED ENERGY- OVER TIME SO

01:48:46.853 --> 01:48:48.021
THERE WERE SEVERAL THEY WERE

01:48:48.088 --> 01:48:49.322
ACTUALLY FOR ROOT CAUSE

01:48:49.389 --> 01:48:51.658
ANALYSIS ROOT CAUSES IN OUR

01:48:51.725 --> 01:48:53.493
ANALYSIS THAT WERE FOUND AMONG

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.695
THEM THAT'S CORRECT FORECASTING

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:58.031
WAS ON ONE OF THE ISSUES

01:48:58.098 --> 01:49:01.835
FORECASTING IN TERMS OF DEMAND.

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:03.270
AND SUPPLY. SO IN IN IN TERMS

01:49:03.336 --> 01:49:06.406
OF THE FORECASTING FOR THE-

01:49:06.473 --> 01:49:10.877
DEMAND- GOING INTO THE FUTURE-

01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:12.846
DO YOU DO YOU HAVE LIKE A- YOU

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:17.817
KNOW- WEATHER EXPERTS THAT ARE

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:20.220
THAT ARE PROVIDING PROJECTIONS

01:49:20.287 --> 01:49:21.988
FOR YOU IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:23.590
WORSE THE EXTREME HEAT

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:26.226
CONDITIONS THE AND THE IN THE

01:49:26.293 --> 01:49:26.726
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:29.162
EXPECTED TO GET. WE WORK VERY

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:30.997
CLOSELY WITH THE CAL AYSO AND

01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:34.301
SEE SEE THEY ALSO HAVE EXPERTS

01:49:34.367 --> 01:49:37.237
FORECASTING EXPERTS AS WELL

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:39.706
AND- WE FORECAST BUT THE

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:41.074
RESPONSIBILITY FOR MOST OF THE

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:43.176
FORECASTING IS ON. ON THE

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:44.077
SHOULDERS OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.947
ENERGY COMMISSION BUT- WE ALL

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:48.949
HAVE VERY IMPORTANT MODELING

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.850
THAT WE FOLLOW THAT AND HELPS

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:53.653
US IN TERMS OF ARE ARE PLANNING

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:55.588
FOR FUTURE PROCUREMENT. AND

01:49:55.655 --> 01:49:58.491
FUTURE THEREFORE FUTURE DEMANDS

01:49:58.558 --> 01:50:00.560
OF ON THE SYSTEM SO. WE HAVE

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:02.095
THE INTEGRATED PLANNING

01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:04.431
RESOURCE PROCESS WHICH WE ARE

01:50:04.497 --> 01:50:06.566
CURRENTLY IN THE INTERIM- I. R.

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:08.501
P. PROCESS NOW IN FACT WE WILL

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:10.337
BE THERE'S A PROPOSED DECISION

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:12.172
THAT'S OUT ON THE STREET AND

01:50:12.238 --> 01:50:13.306
THE COMMISSION WILL BE VOTING

01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:15.008
ON IT AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

01:50:15.075 --> 01:50:17.110
BUT IT IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:20.880
WE HAVE WHERE IN- WE TAKE THE

01:50:20.947 --> 01:50:23.316
FORECASTING AND MODELLING. AND

01:50:23.383 --> 01:50:26.286
A LOT OF PUBLIC INPUT ON AND

01:50:26.353 --> 01:50:29.589
DECIDE WHAT ARM IS NEEDED FOR-

01:50:29.656 --> 01:50:31.691
FUTURE PROCUREMENT AND TO MEET

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:34.094
THE DEMENTIAS AT OUR FORECAST

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.496
IT. CURRENTLY THE I. R. IN THE

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.798
INTERIM I R. P. IS REVIEWING

01:50:38.865 --> 01:50:41.267
THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:44.738
THROUGH TWENTY. TWENTY SIX.

01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:47.640
OKAY SO GET A GIVEN DAY THE

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:51.044
CURRENT I. R. P. GOING OUT TO

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:51.644
TWENTY TWENTY SIX DO YOU HAVE

01:50:51.711 --> 01:50:54.214
LIKE EXTREME HEAT PROJECTIONS.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:58.952
UP THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY SIX

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:01.221
WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE MODEL ON IS

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:03.223
DEMAND WHICH IS WHICH IS DRIVEN

01:51:03.289 --> 01:51:05.225
BY WEATHER CLIMATE CHANGE

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:07.927
WEATHER CONDITIONS AND-

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:10.897
POPULATION- TIMES DURING THAT

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:13.767
THE DATE FOR EXAMPLE- CAL AYE

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:16.569
SO DTERMINES. WHERE THAT

01:51:16.636 --> 01:51:18.772
DEMAND USUALLY LIES AND WE

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:20.173
SPEAK YOU'LL HEAR SPEAK ABOUT

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:23.576
THE NEXT PEAK AND THE- PEAK

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:26.346
HOURS ACTUALLY THOSE HAVE

01:51:26.413 --> 01:51:28.748
CHANGED RECENTLY AGAIN WE ALL

01:51:28.815 --> 01:51:31.217
BELIEVE THAT IT'S DUE TO OUR

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:34.554
SEVERE CLIMATE CHANGE AND- THE

01:51:34.621 --> 01:51:37.824
NEXT PEAK NOW HAS MOVED FROM-

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:40.693
SAY THE LATER HOURS OF SEVEN TO

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.096
THE LATER HOURS OF NINE PM. SO

01:51:43.163 --> 01:51:45.065
WE NOW ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:46.766
HOURS BETWEEN FOUR PM AND NINE

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.468
PM AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE-

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:50.437
DECREASING SUPPLY PARTICULARLY

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:53.640
IN SOLAR- IN THOSE HOURS WHEN

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:56.076
THE SUN IS SETTING SO WE HAVE

01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:57.243
TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:59.546
PLENTY OF RESOURCES TO MAKE UP

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:01.247
FOR THE DECREASE IN SUPPLY NOW

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:02.315
THAT'S ALL PART OF OUR

01:52:02.382 --> 01:52:04.818
FORECASTING AND OUR MODELING

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:07.220
THAT- ON C. B. U. C. DOES THE

01:52:07.287 --> 01:52:10.323
CDC MOST IMPORTANTLY DOES. AND

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:14.394
IT'S ALSO INFORMED. BY AND THE

01:52:14.461 --> 01:52:15.795
CALLOUS SO. IN IN TERMS OF

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:17.664
FORTY AND PLANNING I MEAN IT IS

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.732
THAT THE- FAIR TO SAY THAT

01:52:19.799 --> 01:52:22.068
YOU'RE YOU'RE FORECASTING. THE

01:52:22.135 --> 01:52:24.904
EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS TO GET

01:52:24.971 --> 01:52:25.438
BACK INTO IT TO GET WORSE

01:52:25.505 --> 01:52:28.842
RATHER THAN BETTER. WELL WE AND

01:52:28.908 --> 01:52:30.543
AGAIN IT'S THE MODELING IN

01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:32.946
TERMS OF WHEN. WE MODEL TO

01:52:33.012 --> 01:52:39.085
DEMAND AND THAT'S PART OF THE

01:52:39.152 --> 01:52:40.787
LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:43.156
CURRENT I. R. P. IT'S ALSO-

01:52:43.223 --> 01:52:45.258
WHAT RESOURCES WERE WILL BE

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:47.393
LEADING THE GRIT AND I THINK I

01:52:47.460 --> 01:52:49.095
MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:52.065
ON. THE THAT THE RETIREMENT OF

01:52:52.132 --> 01:52:54.200
DIAVEL CANYON NUCLEAR POWER

01:52:54.267 --> 01:52:56.369
PLANT WILL BE RETIRING TWEEN.

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:58.771
YEARS TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE

01:52:58.838 --> 01:53:00.673
SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IS A

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.575
RESOURCE THAT WE ARE MAKING UP

01:53:02.642 --> 01:53:04.911
WITH IN OUR RESOURCE PLANNING-

01:53:04.978 --> 01:53:06.679
THAT WE'RE DOING CURRENTLY AND

01:53:06.746 --> 01:53:09.149
HAVE DONE IN PRIOR YEARS. I

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:10.350
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT IN

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:14.420
TERMS OF THE FORECASTING OF THE-

01:53:14.487 --> 01:53:17.423
OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND-

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:19.259
THE THAT THE DEMANDS IN TERMS

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:20.727
OF AIR CONDITIONING BACK THAT

01:53:20.793 --> 01:53:23.563
YOU'RE PROJECTING. IS IT FAIR

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.365
TO SAY THAT YOU'RE PROJECTING

01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:27.100
WORSENING EXTREME HEAT

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.935
CONDITIONS RATHER THAN IMPROVE

01:53:29.002 --> 01:53:31.638
YEAH YEAH. OKAY YES WE ARE WE

01:53:31.704 --> 01:53:34.474
ARE. AND SO YOU A. YOU HAVE

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:38.545
ACTUAL- STUDIES THE DATA IS

01:53:38.611 --> 01:53:40.580
PROJECTIONS IN TERMS OF THE

01:53:40.647 --> 01:53:43.016
DEGREE OF EXTREME HEAT. ARE

01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:46.586
EXPECTED TO BE- WORSENING. I'M

IVE BEEN WORKING ON ENSURING

02:03:39.545 --> 02:03:41.080
THAT ALL OF OUR DIVISIONS

02:03:41.147 --> 02:03:43.215
RANGING FROM ELECTRIC AND GAS

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:45.084
TO WATER TELECOMMUNICATIONS

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:47.720
ENERGY. ARE ALL- BUILDING UP

02:03:47.787 --> 02:03:49.555
THEIR ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES SO

THAT WE CAN ACT MORE QUICKLY

WHEN- THE OCCASIONS CALL FOR. I

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:56.462
APPRECIATE THAT AND I

02:03:56.529 --> 02:03:57.463
UNDERSTAND THE ONE POINT

BILLION I'M REALLY FOCUSED ON

02:03:58.798 --> 02:04:00.132

FOCUS ON PREVENTION OF THE

02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:03.335
WILDFIRES UNDERSTAND YOU THEN

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:05.471
FINE. AFTER THE WILD FIRES ARE

02:04:05.538 --> 02:04:06.639
CAUSED BUT I THINK WE NEED MORE

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:07.840
AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE

02:04:07.907 --> 02:04:09.108
SMALL CITATIONS THAT WILL

02:04:09.175 --> 02:04:11.443
PREVENT WILDFIRES- AND THEN WE

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.145
THAT I NOTICED SOMETHING THAT I

02:04:13.212 --> 02:04:14.079
THOUGHT WAS VERY EXCITING IN

02:04:14.146 --> 02:04:15.614

JEANNIE. HOW DO WE GET MORE

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:28.093
EYES ON THESE VIOLATIONS SO WE

02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:29.895
CAN SEE THEM PREVENT THEM AND

02:04:29.962 --> 02:04:30.663
STOP THEM AND SO I THOUGHT THAT

02:04:30.729 --> 02:04:32.731
WAS AN INTERESTING. PILOT THE

02:04:32.798 --> 02:04:33.899

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:36.708
THE RATEPAYER FUNDED PROGRAMS

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:39.311
TO BE COST EFFECTIVE- AND SO

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:41.914
THAT COMMISSION RUNS-

02:08:41.980 --> 02:08:44.049
BIANNUALLY A GOALS AND

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:45.484
POTENTIALS PROGRAM OUT THERE

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:48.020
THAT LOOKS AT THE TOTAL. GOAL

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:50.856
POTENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY

02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:53.492
FROM THE RATEPAYER FUNDED

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.994
INCENTIVE TYPE PROGRAMS- THAT

02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:56.728
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE

02:08:56.795 --> 02:09:00.532
COMMISSION- IT HAS. MORE

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:03.535
PROGRAMS GO INTO CODE MEANING

02:09:03.602 --> 02:09:06.538
THEY'RE MANDATORY- YOU HAVE

02:09:06.605 --> 02:09:09.441
LESS COST EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL-

02:09:09.508 --> 02:09:11.143
FOR THOSE- INCENTIVE PROGRAMS

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:16.281
THAT ARE. OUT THERE IN A GOOD

02:09:16.348 --> 02:09:16.915
EXAMPLE WOULD BE- WE USE THIS A

02:09:16.982 --> 02:09:19.184
LOT OF MY ON- LIGHTING- BECAUSE

02:09:19.251 --> 02:09:20.586
THAT WAS A VERY COST EFFECTIVE

02:09:20.652 --> 02:09:23.088
WAY TO GET- ENERGY EFFICIENCY

02:09:23.155 --> 02:09:26.291
IMPROVEMENT- HOWEVER- BOTH IN

02:09:26.358 --> 02:09:28.427
THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL NOW

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:32.097
THAT THERE ARE A VERY- YEAH

02:09:32.164 --> 02:09:35.968
VERY SPECIFIC VERY- AGGRESSIVE

02:09:36.034 --> 02:09:38.537
LIGHTING- CODES AND STANDARDS

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:42.307
FOR- LED LIGHTS- AND OF LIGHTS

02:09:42.374 --> 02:09:43.075
THAT ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN

02:09:43.142 --> 02:09:44.977
THE OLD CONTACT- INCANDESCENT

02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:47.346
LIGHTS- OF THOSE HAVE BEEN.

02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:48.947
PHASED OUT OF THE INCENTIVE

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:50.082
PROGRAMS THAT WE OVERSEE

02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.983
BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER NEED

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:53.318
INCENTIVES ARE MANDATED COAT-

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:54.520
AND SO YOU SEE THAT DECREASE

02:09:54.586 --> 02:09:57.022
THEIR- IN SO. LONG WAY TO GET

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:58.290
TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION IS

02:09:58.357 --> 02:10:00.058
WHERE ARE WE ON THIS SB THREE

02:10:00.125 --> 02:10:03.729
FIFTY GOALS- WE ARE NOT ALL ON.

02:10:03.795 --> 02:10:06.365
TARGET TO GET TO THOSE GOALS AS

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:11.837
A DOUBLING- RIGHT NOW- IF YOU

02:10:11.904 --> 02:10:13.105
LOOK AT IT STRICTLY AS AN

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:16.441
ENERGY EFFICIENCY- PART- BUT

02:10:16.508 --> 02:10:18.243
THAT'S A JOINT AGENCY EFFORT

02:10:18.310 --> 02:10:20.012
IT'S NOT JUST THE UTILITY SPEND

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:21.647
I DON'T THINK UTILITY SPEND

02:10:21.713 --> 02:10:24.449
GOING DOWN. IS WHAT'S KEEPING A

02:10:24.516 --> 02:10:26.451
SOFT TARGET HOWEVER ON THE FLIP

02:10:26.518 --> 02:10:29.755
SIDE- THIS STATE HAS VERY

02:10:29.821 --> 02:10:32.691
AGGRESSIVELY MOVED- TOWARDS

02:10:32.758 --> 02:10:35.060
BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION- AND

02:10:35.127 --> 02:10:37.829
WE ARE WORKING WITH- OUR SISTER

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.299
AGENCY THE CC AND- BEER

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:42.668
RESOURCES BOARD TO LOOK AT THAT

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:44.770
FUEL SWITCHING OF MOVING PEOPLE

02:10:44.836 --> 02:10:48.340
FROM. USING NATURAL GAS TO

02:10:48.407 --> 02:10:50.842
USING ELECTRICITY- AND HOW THAT

02:10:50.909 --> 02:10:53.946
IMPACTS- OUR OVERALL ENERGY

02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:55.514
USAGE WHICH IS HOW WE SHOULD BE

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.916
DEFINING THIS ENERGY EFFICIENCY

02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:59.384
GOING FORWARD AND NOT JUST

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:04.623
LOOKING AT IT- FROM-

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:05.624
ELECTRICITY STAVING STANDPOINT.

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:06.391
THANK YOU KNOW I MEAN I DO

02:11:06.458 --> 02:11:08.260
THINK THAT THE EXTENT THAT WE

02:11:08.327 --> 02:11:10.495
ARE SEEING A SHIFT. IN A LOT OF

02:11:10.562 --> 02:11:11.897
WAYS YOU JUST MENTIONED WE

02:11:11.964 --> 02:11:13.732
SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER AS A

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.368
LEGISLATURE. AND AN AGENCY TO

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:18.103
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:19.504
MAKE CHANGES TO ENSURE WE ARE

02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:20.472
MOVING ENERGY EFFICIENT

02:11:20.539 --> 02:11:22.307
VEHICLES FORWARD IN GETTING

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:23.275
TOWARDS THAT TARGET IS IT'S

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:25.510
REALLY CRITICAL. BUT I THINK

02:11:25.577 --> 02:11:26.111

TIME THAT WE CONNECTED WAS WHEN

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:43.161
YOU HAD FIRST BEEN APPOINTED IN

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:44.997
TWENTY NINETEEN AND- I KNOW

THAT IT'S BEEN A VERY

02:11:46.398 --> 02:11:47.799
INTERESTING YEAR FOR ALL OF US

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:49.234
RELATED TO KOBE DID EVERYTHING

02:11:49.301 --> 02:11:51.370

COLLEAGUES. WHO HAVE- EXPRESSED

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:58.877
THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND

02:11:58.944 --> 02:12:01.680
FRUSTRATION WITH THE LACK TIME

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:03.282
AND JUST HOW LONG IT TAKES TO

02:12:03.348 --> 02:12:06.918
GET RESPONSES OR A MOVEMENT

02:12:06.985 --> 02:12:08.287
FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

02:12:08.353 --> 02:12:10.689
UTILITIES COMMISSION I WANT TO

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:11.690
BRING UP THE ISSUE OTHER WAS

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:13.258
BROUGHT UP BEFORE AT THAT'S THE

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:14.893
ISSUE OF NET ENERGY METERING

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.461
AND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT I

02:12:16.528 --> 02:12:18.530
WANT TO GO AND ACTUALLY LOOK AT

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:20.399
THE REPORT THAT WAS. PUBLISHED

BY THE P. UC IN FEBRUARY OF

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:25.437
THIS YEAR UTILITY UTILITY COSTS

02:12:25.504 --> 02:12:26.905
AND AFFORDABILITY OF THE GRID

02:12:26.972 --> 02:12:28.507
OF THE FUTURE AND EVALUATION OF

02:12:28.573 --> 02:12:30.909
ELECTRIC COST RATES AND EQUITY

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:33.779
ISSUES- ON PAGE TWENTY EIGHT

02:12:33.845 --> 02:12:35.314
WHEN YOU GO TO WHEN THE STUDY

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:40.152
THAT- YOU PRODUCED- SOME

02:12:40.218 --> 02:12:42.654
ALARMING INFORMATION. AND I'D

02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:43.689
LIKE TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO

02:12:43.755 --> 02:12:45.190
JUST READ A LITTLE BIT- SO THAT

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:46.591
WE ALL HAVE CONTACTS IN TERMS

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:48.093
OF WHAT I'M DESCRIBING. WHEN IT

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:49.561
COMES TO NET ENERGY METERING

02:12:49.628 --> 02:12:51.296
SNAM NAM CUSTOMERS ARE

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:53.332
DISPROPORTIONATELY OLDER.

02:12:53.398 --> 02:12:55.834
LOCATED IN HIGH INCOME AREAS

02:12:55.901 --> 02:12:57.703
LIKELY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOME.

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:59.104
AND LESS LIKELY TO LIVE IN A

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:00.639
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY.

02:13:00.706 --> 02:13:02.641
CONSEQUENTLY THE COST OF NET

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:04.176
ENERGY METERING. ARE

02:13:04.242 --> 02:13:05.510
DISPROPORTIONATELY PAID BY

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:07.446
YOUNGER LESS WEALTHY AND MORE

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:09.648
DISADVANTAGED RATE PAYERS. MANY

02:13:09.715 --> 02:13:11.650
OF WHOM ARE RENTERS. TO ADDRESS

02:13:11.717 --> 02:13:14.319
THIS CONCERN- IT'S NOTED THAT

02:13:14.386 --> 02:13:15.087
THE PC WILL BE DOING SOMETHING

02:13:15.153 --> 02:13:16.955
ABOUT THAT. UGH THIS YEAR

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:19.391
MOVING FORWARD I REPRESENT A

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:21.727
COMMUNITY- THAT IS 20% BELOW

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:23.695
THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE. THAT

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:25.497
IS- IN EAST LOS ANGELES AND

02:13:25.564 --> 02:13:27.933
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE.

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:31.870
THAT IS NOT- SERVICE BY LADWP

02:13:31.937 --> 02:13:34.272
BUT BY AND THEN THE- AN

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:36.708
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY. EDISON

02:13:36.775 --> 02:13:39.478
IN IN THE SAME REPORT- IT

02:13:39.544 --> 02:13:40.645
STATES THAT AS OF DECEMBER

02:13:40.712 --> 02:13:42.781
TWENTY TWENTY. APPROXIMATELY

02:13:42.848 --> 02:13:44.316
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE

02:13:44.383 --> 02:13:44.950
THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL NAME COULD

FIVE MILLION CARE CUSTOMERS

02:13:49.087 --> 02:13:50.889
PARTICIPATED- OR RECEIVE THEIR

02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:53.258
ENERGY THROUGH EDISON. OF THESE

02:13:53.325 --> 02:13:55.527
CARE CUSTOMERS ONLY 4%

02:13:55.594 --> 02:13:57.629
PARTICIPATED IN THEM. MEANING

02:13:57.696 --> 02:13:59.364
OVER ONE POINT FOUR MILLION

02:13:59.431 --> 02:14:01.333
CARE CUSTOMERS WERE LOW INCOME

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.535
FAMILIES. OR ABOUT NINETY SIX

02:14:03.602 --> 02:14:04.936
PERCENT. SHOULDER THE

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.705
ADDITIONAL COST BURDEN BURDEN

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:08.974
FROM ALL NON CUSTOMERS. THIS IS

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.543
IN YOUR REPORT. AND IT'S TAKEN

02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:14.579
THE P. YOU SEE YEARS. YEARS AND

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:16.848
YEARS. TO DO SOMETHING TO

02:14:16.915 --> 02:14:18.817
ADDRESS THE COST SHIFT. I'D

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:20.719
LIKE TO KNOW FROM YOU DIRECTLY.

02:14:20.786 --> 02:14:23.455
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE. TO A LOW

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:25.824
INCOME FAMILY THAT'S A CARE

02:14:25.891 --> 02:14:28.026
CUSTOMER. THAT'S HAVING TO PAY

02:14:28.093 --> 02:14:31.163
THE COST OF THE COST SHIFT AND

02:14:31.229 --> 02:14:31.763
THE DIFFERENCE. FROM THE MORE

02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:33.865
AFFLUENT. CUSTOMERS THAT

02:14:33.932 --> 02:14:35.400
ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE BENEFIT

02:14:35.467 --> 02:14:37.502
FROM THEM WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

02:14:37.569 --> 02:14:38.236
THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

02:14:38.303 --> 02:14:40.439
STRUGGLING. TO COMPARE LEADER

02:14:40.505 --> 02:14:41.940
FOR THE RENT. PUT FOOD ON THE

02:14:42.007 --> 02:14:45.210
TABLE. AND WE AND ACTUALLY WILL

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:47.813
BENEFIT FROM THE PC AT

02:14:47.879 --> 02:14:50.515
ADDRESSING. THIS BURDEN OF THE

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.050
COST SHIFT THAT HAS NOT BEEN

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:53.118
ADDRESSED WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:54.386
THOSE LOW INCOME FAMILIES AS TO

02:14:54.453 --> 02:14:59.458
WHY. THE PC HAS FAILED TO ACT.

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:01.860
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD SAY

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:03.261
THAT I'M IS DISHEARTENED AS YOU

02:15:03.328 --> 02:15:07.899
ARE- AND WE HAVE A AS I SPOKE

02:15:07.966 --> 02:15:10.368
EARLIER SKEWS ME. WE HAVE A

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:12.704
PROCEEDING. THAT IS CURRENTLY

02:15:12.771 --> 02:15:15.540
UNDER WAY THAT WILL- THAT IS

02:15:15.607 --> 02:15:16.908
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE

02:15:16.975 --> 02:15:19.177
COST SHIFT VERY CLOSELY AT THE

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:20.779
ISSUE THAT YOU JUST VERY WELL

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:22.848
DESCRIBED- I WOULD SAY THE

02:15:22.914 --> 02:15:25.050
INEQUITY OR THE UNFAIRNESS. OF

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:27.519
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE- THAT THE

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:30.255
INTERNET ENERGY METERING- HAS

02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:32.157
IN ITS IN ITS CURTAIN CURRENT

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:34.292
FORM THAT PROCEEDING WILL BE

02:15:34.359 --> 02:15:36.394
CONCLUDING AT THE END OF THIS

02:15:36.461 --> 02:15:38.096
YEAR AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND

02:15:38.163 --> 02:15:39.898
INDYCAR SHIFT IS A VERY

02:15:39.965 --> 02:15:42.000
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:42.601
PROCEEDING THAT WE ARE LOOKING

02:15:42.667 --> 02:15:46.037
AT. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE

02:15:46.104 --> 02:15:47.973
THAT ANSWER BUT I WHAT I'M

02:15:48.039 --> 02:15:51.276
MISSING IS THE COMPASSION. WHAT

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:52.878
I'M MISSING IS THE FACT THAT

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:55.480
IT'S- THIS COULD HAVE BEEN

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:56.882
FIXED YEARS AGO AND IT STILL

02:15:56.948 --> 02:16:00.785
HASN'T. AND IT IT WEIGHS

02:16:00.852 --> 02:16:03.588
HEAVILY ON CARE CUSTOMERS WHO

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:06.791
ARE ALREADY INCREDIBLY AT.

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:10.195
HURTING AND OUR PAVON TO PAY

02:16:10.262 --> 02:16:11.730
THE DIFFERENCE FOR SOMEBODY WHO

02:16:11.796 --> 02:16:13.932
IS MORE AFFLUENT WHO IS NOT

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:14.499
PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE INTO

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:18.136
THE GRID. WELL I APOLOGIZE IF I

02:16:18.203 --> 02:16:21.206
DO NOT SEEN AND COMPASSIONATE.

02:16:21.273 --> 02:16:22.974
AND THAT I DON'T HAVE THAT I'M

02:16:23.041 --> 02:16:24.643
NOT SHOWING ON THE NEEDED

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:25.710
PASSION I THINK THAT MY

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:26.811
COLLEAGUES AND MY FELLOW

02:16:26.878 --> 02:16:29.981
COMMISSIONERS. BUT A TEST TO.

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:33.985
BOTH MY PASSION AND THERE IS-

02:16:34.052 --> 02:16:36.855
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT

02:16:36.922 --> 02:16:39.024
ELECTRICITY IS SAFE AND

02:16:39.090 --> 02:16:41.026
RELIABLE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:43.662
AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE. AND AS

02:16:43.728 --> 02:16:46.998
I SAID WE ARE. CURRENTLY

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:48.300
ADDRESSING GOING TO BE

02:16:48.366 --> 02:16:50.035
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE I CAN'T

02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:51.570
UNDER UNDER RULES AND

02:16:51.636 --> 02:16:54.205
REGULATIONS TELL YOU THAT IT'S

02:16:54.272 --> 02:16:55.574
MOST DEFINITELY THIS IS THE

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:57.742
DECISION OF THE PROCEEDING- I

02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.544
WOULD BE GETTING OUT AHEAD OF

02:16:59.611 --> 02:17:00.045
THE VOTES OF MY FELLOW

02:17:00.111 --> 02:17:02.547
COMMISSIONERS BUT- COST SHIFT

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:05.183
HAS BEEN ANALYZED YOU YOU- WELL

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:07.018
RECITED FROM A REPORT. THERE'S

02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:08.353
OTHER MODELING THAT WE HAVE

02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:10.522
BEEN NOT DONE WE WILL BE TAKING

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:12.657
FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:14.693
ISSUE THIS EXTREMELY INFORMING

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:15.994
TO US AND WE WILL BE MAKING A

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:17.195
DECISION AT THE END OF THE

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:20.298
YEAR. AND I DO CARE DEEPLY FOR

02:17:20.365 --> 02:17:23.268
YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND ALL AND

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:24.836
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:17:24.903 --> 02:17:26.504
DISADVANTAGED AND IN LOW INCOME

02:17:26.571 --> 02:17:28.707
AREAS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE WE

02:17:28.773 --> 02:17:30.475
HAVE INCREASED THIS YEAR SADLY

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:32.177
BECAUSE A PANDEMIC MOSTLY

02:17:32.243 --> 02:17:33.778
BELIEVE INCLUDE INCREASE THE

02:17:33.845 --> 02:17:36.014
CUSTOMERS THAT- SUBSCRIBE TO

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:40.719
CARE. AND FARAH- AND- I'M I

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:41.720
THINK THAT IS A VERY VERY

02:17:41.786 --> 02:17:44.122
IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT MANY

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:45.724
CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING

02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:47.392
STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR

02:17:47.459 --> 02:17:50.562
ELECTRICITY BILLS. AND THIS THE

02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:52.931
MORE EFFICIENCY THAT WE CAN

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:55.100
BRING TO THE ELECTRIC GRID AND

02:17:55.166 --> 02:17:58.436
THE MORE WE CAN. DO THAT WILL

02:17:58.503 --> 02:18:02.574
BRING- OUR RATES DOWN AND THE

02:18:02.641 --> 02:18:05.343
MORE WE CAN DO THAT BRINGS-

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:07.712
GREATER EFFICIENCY IN TERMS OF

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:09.114
WHAT WE'RE DOING TO OUR

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:11.049
ENVIRONMENT- GREATER

02:18:11.116 --> 02:18:13.451
EFFECTIVENESS I SHOULD SAY. IS

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:14.352
BETTER FOR EVERYONE

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:16.488
PARTICULARLY THOSE FOLKS THAT

02:18:16.554 --> 02:18:18.289
DO LIVE IN DISADVANTAGED

02:18:18.356 --> 02:18:21.526
COMMUNITIES AND- ARE ON MORE

02:18:21.593 --> 02:18:22.460
SUBJECT TO SOME OF THE

02:18:22.527 --> 02:18:24.129
POLLUTANTS AND SOME OF THE

02:18:24.195 --> 02:18:26.498
OTHER- DIFFICULTIES THAT COME

02:18:26.564 --> 02:18:29.200
FROM ON INDUSTRIAL WASTE IF YOU

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:32.170
WILL. I WANT TO JUST- A

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:33.538
CLARIFYING QUESTION BECAUSE

02:18:33.605 --> 02:18:34.439
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

02:18:34.506 --> 02:18:36.941
MISINFORMATION BEING SHARED. ON

02:18:37.008 --> 02:18:38.543
SOCIAL MEDIA WITH RELATES

02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:40.779
RELATING TO A PARTICULAR BILL

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.247
OTHER WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSE

02:18:42.313 --> 02:18:44.849
AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT IS

02:18:44.916 --> 02:18:47.052
REGARDING RATES CAN YOU PLEASE

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:49.454
CLARIFY ON THE RECORD WHO IS

02:18:49.521 --> 02:18:50.889
RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTOR OWNED

02:18:50.955 --> 02:18:52.824
UTILITY RATES. IS THAT THE

02:18:52.891 --> 02:18:54.659
UTILITIES THEMSELVES OR IS IT

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:58.129
THE TO UC. THIS ABUSING SO WHEN

02:18:58.196 --> 02:19:00.165
WE SEE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

02:19:00.231 --> 02:19:04.269
REYES REPAIR- REYES RAISE THE

02:19:04.335 --> 02:19:07.572
RED THE RATES ON ON UTILITIES

02:19:07.639 --> 02:19:09.607
THAT'S BECAUSE THE PC HAS NOT

02:19:09.674 --> 02:19:13.144
ACT ACTED IS THAT ACCURATE.

02:19:13.211 --> 02:19:15.980
RELATED TO NINETY EIGHT RELATED

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:17.816
TO MAKE SHIFTING COSTS. I'M

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:20.452
SORRY- IF I MAY JUST GREAT TOO

02:19:20.518 --> 02:19:22.721
LITTLE BED- THE RATE RATES-

02:19:22.787 --> 02:19:24.856
THAT ARE INCREASED BY THE

02:19:24.923 --> 02:19:26.925
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:28.560
TO BE APPROVED BY THE FUSEE.

02:19:28.626 --> 02:19:29.694
CORRECT SO THAT MEANS THAT THE

02:19:29.761 --> 02:19:31.696
P. U. C. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:19:31.763 --> 02:19:33.798
EITHER ACTING OR NOT ACTING ON

02:19:33.865 --> 02:19:37.736
THE COST SHIFT. WE ARE

02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:39.904
RESPONSIBLE YES SO JUST FOR THE

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:42.307
RECORD THE PC IS RESPONSIBLE

02:19:42.373 --> 02:19:44.709
FOR THE CAUTIOUS AND NOT THE

02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:45.243
INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR OWNED

02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:48.913
UTILITIES CORRECT. AS IT COMES

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:50.749
AS IT THREE AS AS YOU'RE

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:53.318
REFERRING TO- NET ENERGY

02:19:53.384 --> 02:19:56.421
METERING YES. I THINK THAT

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:57.655
WOULD BE ACCURATE NO WAY YOU

02:19:57.722 --> 02:20:00.992
LAID IT OUT. IS THAT IN MY IN

02:20:01.059 --> 02:20:03.128
MY CORRECT. ADDRESS YES THANK

02:20:03.194 --> 02:20:06.464
YOU. OKAY I JUST WANT TO MAKE

02:20:06.531 --> 02:20:07.599
SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT ON

02:20:07.665 --> 02:20:09.267
RECORD BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

02:20:09.334 --> 02:20:12.003
MISINFORMATION AS TO WHO IS

02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:13.705
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST SHIFT

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:14.739
WHETHER IT'S THE UTILITIES THE

02:20:14.806 --> 02:20:15.807
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

02:20:15.874 --> 02:20:17.809
THEMSELVES OR WHETHER IT'S THE

02:20:17.876 --> 02:20:19.210
P. YOU SEE IN BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:20:19.277 --> 02:20:21.446
SEEN. A FAILURE TO ACT FOR THE

02:20:21.513 --> 02:20:23.414
ON THE NET ENERGY METERING IN

02:20:23.481 --> 02:20:25.216
THE COSTA FOR MANY YEARS NOW

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:26.184
THERE SEEMS TO BE AN

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:28.319
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET TO A

02:20:28.386 --> 02:20:29.954
BETTER PLACE BY THE END OF THIS

02:20:30.021 --> 02:20:30.555
YEAR WHICH IS WHAT I HEARD YOU

02:20:30.622 --> 02:20:32.257
SAY EARLIER- AND I'M REALLY

02:20:32.323 --> 02:20:33.491
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT BECAUSE

02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:35.360
AGAIN I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. MY

02:20:35.426 --> 02:20:37.862
LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN EAST

02:20:37.929 --> 02:20:40.465
LOS ANGELES WHO ARE ALREADY 20%

02:20:40.532 --> 02:20:42.467
BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY

02:20:42.534 --> 02:20:44.369
LINE. SHOULD HAVE TO. CARRY THE

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:46.104
BURDEN OF HAVING TO PAY THE

02:20:46.171 --> 02:20:48.706
DIFFERENCE. FOR A MORE AFFLUENT

02:20:48.773 --> 02:20:52.577
COMMUNITY RIGHT NEXT DOOR. YES

02:20:52.644 --> 02:20:56.214
THANK YOU. OKAY I WANT ONE JUST

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.982
FINAL QUESTION A NIGHT I

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:59.250
APPRECIATE THE TIME AND

02:20:59.317 --> 02:21:01.753
CONSIDERATION BUT IS IT THE

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:02.954
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:05.356
LEGISLATURE TO PUSH LEGISLATION

02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:06.825
TO MAKE THE P. YOU SEE OCT OR

02:21:06.891 --> 02:21:08.193
SHOULD THE P. YOU SEE ACT BE

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:10.161
DOING ITS JOB AND- MOVING

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:13.231
FORWARD WITH WHAT'S NEEDED.

02:21:13.298 --> 02:21:15.700
WELL I'M THE LEGISLATURE IS A

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:17.368
SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

02:21:17.435 --> 02:21:18.903
AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:21.739
EVERY RIGHT AND RESPONSIBILITY

02:21:21.806 --> 02:21:23.141
TO PASS LAWS THAT INSTRUCT THE

02:21:23.208 --> 02:21:25.076
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. HOW TO DO

02:21:25.143 --> 02:21:26.644
THEIR JOB SO I WOULD NEVER

02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:29.247
QUESTION THE AUTHORITY OR THE

02:21:29.314 --> 02:21:30.281
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

02:21:30.348 --> 02:21:32.250
LEGISLATURE HOWEVER HAVING SAID

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:35.620
THAT. WE OF THE PC OR ANY OTHER

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:37.055
STATE AGENCY THAT I HAVE BEEN

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.356
INVOLVED IN HAS A

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:40.725
RESPONSIBILITY TO OPERATE IN A

02:21:40.792 --> 02:21:45.563
VERY EFFECTIVE- MANNER AND TO

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:47.131
TAKE CARE OF THOSE THEY ARE.

02:21:47.198 --> 02:21:48.600
RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THAT'S IN

02:21:48.666 --> 02:21:50.835
OUR CASE IT'S THE RATEPAYERS

02:21:50.902 --> 02:21:52.837
AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO

02:21:52.904 --> 02:21:56.474
WE SHOULD ALWAYS ACT ON BEHALF

02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:58.977
OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THANK

02:21:59.043 --> 02:22:00.912
YOU- PRESIDENT DODGER REALLY

02:22:00.979 --> 02:22:02.914
APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER BECAUSE-

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:04.215
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

02:22:04.282 --> 02:22:05.216
LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:07.619
MOVING- MOST RECENTLY HERE IN

02:22:07.685 --> 02:22:09.153
THE ASSEMBLY IS ACTUALLY

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:10.855
LEGISLATION THAT WAS NEEDED HAD

02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:13.524
THE PC ACTED ACCORDINGLY IN THE

02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:15.527
LAST FEW YEARS NOW I RECOGNIZE.

02:22:15.593 --> 02:22:16.761
THAT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP

02:22:16.828 --> 02:22:17.829
THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE AND I'M

02:22:17.896 --> 02:22:18.730
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

02:22:18.796 --> 02:22:20.331
SEEING THAT UP BUT IT REALLY

02:22:20.398 --> 02:22:21.633
DOES BEG THE QUESTION THAT IF

02:22:21.699 --> 02:22:22.500
THERE IS RESPECT FOR THE

02:22:22.567 --> 02:22:24.669
LEGISLATURE AND THE PC HAS NOT

02:22:24.736 --> 02:22:26.671
ACTED ON THE LEGISLATION PASSED

02:22:26.738 --> 02:22:28.206
TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:30.074
ADDRESSING THE COST SHIFT

02:22:30.141 --> 02:22:31.075
RELATED TO THE NET ENERGY

02:22:31.142 --> 02:22:33.177
METERING THEN WE'RE GOING

02:22:33.244 --> 02:22:34.846
AROUND IN CIRCLES IN TERMS OF

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.180
PASSING LEGISLATION THAT'S

02:22:36.247 --> 02:22:38.116
IMPORTANT YEARS AND YEARS WHERE

02:22:38.182 --> 02:22:39.884
THERE IS NO ACTION. AND NOW

02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:41.619
HERE WE ARE WITH YOUR OWN

02:22:41.686 --> 02:22:43.554
REPORT THAT CAME OUT IN

02:22:43.621 --> 02:22:44.956
FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR

02:22:45.023 --> 02:22:46.824
INDICATING A REAL INEQUITY

02:22:46.891 --> 02:22:48.226
ISSUE RELATED TO SOLAR AND

02:22:48.293 --> 02:22:49.894
RELATED TO NET ENERGY METERING

02:22:49.961 --> 02:22:51.429
AND RELATED TO UTILITIES

02:22:51.496 --> 02:22:53.498
OVERALL SO AGAIN I KNOW THAT.

02:22:53.564 --> 02:22:54.399
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

02:22:54.465 --> 02:22:55.867
WORKING ON AND HOPEFULLY BY THE

02:22:55.934 --> 02:22:56.834
END OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE A

02:22:56.901 --> 02:22:58.736
RESOLUTION BUT JUST KNOW THAT

02:22:58.803 --> 02:22:59.570
THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US THAT

02:22:59.637 --> 02:23:01.339
ARE LOOKING AT CLIMATE CHANGE

02:23:01.406 --> 02:23:02.540
AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

02:23:02.607 --> 02:23:05.076
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE GRID- THE

02:23:05.143 --> 02:23:08.079
REALITY OF. A REACHING 1100%

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:09.948
RENEWABLES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE

02:23:10.014 --> 02:23:10.848
AND OTHER GOALS THAT WE HAVE

02:23:10.915 --> 02:23:12.483
PUT UPON THE STATE THAT I

02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:14.953
BELIEVE IN. BUT BY DOING SO WE

02:23:15.019 --> 02:23:16.654
ALSO NEED THE P. YOU SEE TO ACT

02:23:16.721 --> 02:23:19.090
AND TO ALSO FIGURE OUT A WAY

02:23:19.157 --> 02:23:20.458
THAT WE DON'T PUT THE BURDENS

02:23:20.525 --> 02:23:22.160
ON LOW INCOME FAMILY SIMPLY

02:23:22.226 --> 02:23:23.194
BECAUSE THEY DON'T OWN THE ROOF

02:23:23.261 --> 02:23:25.630
OVER THEIR HEADS. RENTERS ALSO

02:23:25.697 --> 02:23:27.332
NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART

02:23:27.398 --> 02:23:29.634
OF THE CLIMATE SOLUTION- AND IT

02:23:29.701 --> 02:23:30.768
SHOULDN'T BE ON THE BURKE ON

02:23:30.835 --> 02:23:31.803
THE BACKS OF LOW INCOME

02:23:37.342 --> 02:23:39.477
AN ISSUE ABOUT EQUITY. AND

02:23:39.544 --> 02:23:40.345
ENSURING THAT AS WE MOVE

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:43.014
FORWARD WE ARE PART OF THE

02:23:43.081 --> 02:23:45.083
SOLUTION. VERSES THIS

02:23:45.149 --> 02:23:47.051
CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING

MAIN CONCERNS I'VE HAD AS AND

02:24:46.210 --> 02:24:48.579
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND I

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:49.147
HAVE BEEN ASKING THIS FOR A

02:24:49.213 --> 02:24:52.583
LONG TIME. IS WHY ARE WE MORE

02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:54.652
EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER STATES. WE

02:24:54.719 --> 02:24:56.587
TEND TO GET FAIRLY VAGUE

02:24:56.654 --> 02:24:59.657
ANSWERS. ARM I'M GOING TO BE

02:24:59.724 --> 02:25:02.627
SENDING YOU A LETTER- WHICH

02:25:02.693 --> 02:25:06.397
WILL DESCRIBE. A WAY TO MAKE

02:25:06.464 --> 02:25:10.768
THIS LESS- LAST DAY IN

02:25:10.835 --> 02:25:13.604
PARTICULAR THERE'S A BILL THEIR

02:25:13.671 --> 02:25:17.108
KEYS ME THERE'S A- LET EXCUSE

02:25:17.175 --> 02:25:22.480
ME A PAPER THAT'S WRITTEN. BY

02:25:22.547 --> 02:25:26.317
THE HARSH SHE'S ME HAAS ENERGY

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:28.753
INSTITUTE AT UC BERKELEY- BY

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:32.156
BARGE DEAN VALLEY AND SOLLY-

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:34.092
WHICH COULD HAS A METHODOLOGY

02:25:34.158 --> 02:25:38.262
OF. TAKING THE FIXED COSTS.

02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:40.898
TAKING THE VARIABLE COSTS

02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:44.035
SEPARATING THOSE OUT SEPARATELY

02:25:44.102 --> 02:25:46.938
IN A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES IN

02:25:47.004 --> 02:25:49.207
PARTICULAR LOOKING AT. OUR

02:25:49.273 --> 02:25:51.909
GENERATION SO THERE'S SOME

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:55.413
FIXED COSTS ARE LIKE THE ABOVE

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:57.882
MARKET RATES THAT WE PAY TO

02:25:57.949 --> 02:26:00.184
INITIALLY GET SOLAR STARTED-

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.319
THEN THERE'S THE COST OF

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:03.554
ACTUALLY GENERATING THE ENERGY.

02:26:03.621 --> 02:26:05.056
THERE'S FIXED COSTS FOR

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:07.525
TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:11.229
VARIABLE COSTS. MOSTLY FIXED

02:26:11.295 --> 02:26:13.231
COST FOR DISTRIBUTION BUT SOME

02:26:13.297 --> 02:26:17.135
VARIABLE COST. SOME COST DUE TO

02:26:17.201 --> 02:26:20.037
POLLUTION WHICH IS SOCIAL COST

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:22.840
AND THEN SOMETHING WHICH IS

02:26:22.907 --> 02:26:23.274
ACTUALLY LARGER THAN

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:25.409
TRANSMISSION. WHICH IS

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:27.111
SOMETHING YOU'VE JUST BEEN

02:26:27.178 --> 02:26:28.613
ASKED ABOUT WHICH IS THE

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:30.715
SUBSIDY FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR IT'S

02:26:30.781 --> 02:26:32.884
ACTUALLY LARGER THAN LEAST ON

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:35.052
THIS GRAPH IF I LOOK AT IT IT

02:26:35.119 --> 02:26:37.054
LOOKS TO BE LARGER THAN THE

02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:40.525
COST OF TRANSMISSION. BOB AT

02:26:40.591 --> 02:26:42.527
ANY RATE IF YOU COULD AND AGAIN

02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:44.562
I'LL PUT THIS IN A LETTER. IF

02:26:44.629 --> 02:26:47.331
YOU COULD- TELL US HOW THESE

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:49.400
VARIOUS COST COMPARED TO OTHER

02:26:49.467 --> 02:26:53.471
STATES. SO WE CAN SEE OF THE

02:26:53.538 --> 02:26:55.273
NEARLY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:58.809
RATE. HOW MUCH OF THAT IS DUE

02:26:58.876 --> 02:27:01.045
TO OUR COST OF DISTRIBUTION AND

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:03.414
GENERATION. HOW MUCH OF IT IS

02:27:03.481 --> 02:27:07.351
DUE TO- ENERGY PROGRAMS LIKE-

02:27:07.418 --> 02:27:08.686
ENERGY CONSERVATION WHICH

02:27:08.753 --> 02:27:12.089
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. AS WELL AS-

02:27:12.156 --> 02:27:16.394
ROOFTOP SOLAR. SO IF YOU THAT'S

02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:18.362
THE GENERAL IDEA AGAIN I WILL

02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:19.964
SEND YOU A LETTER ALONG WITH

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:22.099
THE REFERENCE TO THIS PAPER AND

02:27:22.166 --> 02:27:24.068
IF YOU COULD JUST COMPARE

02:27:24.135 --> 02:27:26.304
AVERAGE US COSTS FOR THESE

02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:30.942
VARIOUS- PARTS OF THE- PUZZLE

02:27:31.008 --> 02:27:33.644
HERE WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA

02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:37.048
OF WIRE COSTS ARE SO HIGH.

02:27:37.114 --> 02:27:38.049
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:40.785
VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I'M

02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:42.820
ON TEN MILLION WITH THE PAPER I

02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:44.755
DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME-

02:27:44.822 --> 02:27:46.357
DR BORENSTEIN HAS INDEED

02:27:46.424 --> 02:27:50.561
TESTIFIED IN ONE OF OUR- PUBLIC

02:27:50.628 --> 02:27:52.830
HEARINGS. ON THE PAPER AND ON

02:27:52.897 --> 02:27:55.399
SOME OF THE THEORY THAT THAT HE

02:27:55.466 --> 02:27:58.669
HAS PUT FORTH- ONE OF THE A

02:27:58.736 --> 02:27:59.737
COUPLE OF COSTS WHEN YOU DID

02:27:59.804 --> 02:28:02.740
MENTION OF AND ONE THAT THERE

02:28:02.807 --> 02:28:05.042
IS ANOTHER DRIVER OF THE

02:28:05.109 --> 02:28:09.013
UTILITY COSTS AND RATE DRIVERS.

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:10.648
ONE IS OF COURSE- YOU YOU

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:14.652
SPOKE- ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION

02:28:14.719 --> 02:28:16.921
COSTS TRANSMISSION COSTS- ARE

02:28:16.988 --> 02:28:21.292
REALLY ESCALATING QUITE HEAVILY-

02:28:21.359 --> 02:28:24.428
AND ALSO OUR WELFARE MITIGATION

02:28:24.495 --> 02:28:29.000
COSTS. YES BOTH THE- BOTH THE

02:28:29.066 --> 02:28:31.802
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COSTS AND

02:28:31.869 --> 02:28:34.338
THEN OF COURSE THE HARDENING.

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:37.108
OF THE SYSTEMS IN OUR IOUS IT'S

02:28:37.174 --> 02:28:40.945
COSTLY AND- THOSE ARE TWO.

02:28:41.012 --> 02:28:42.380
PRETTY STRONG RIGHT DRIVERS

02:28:42.446 --> 02:28:44.915
RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA ASK- AND I

02:28:44.982 --> 02:28:46.517
DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE DETAILS

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:47.551
OF OTHER STATES I DON'T KNOW

02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:48.686
THAT MISTER RANDOLPH WELL

02:28:48.753 --> 02:28:51.155
EITHER THE COMPARISONS BUT HE

02:28:51.222 --> 02:28:52.857
MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA THAN I

02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:54.058
DO A MORE THOROUGH IDEA YEAH

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:55.693
LET ME JUST TAKE THAT OUR RATES

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.828
WERE ALREADY TWICE AS HIGH

02:28:57.895 --> 02:29:00.197
BEFORE WE WERE PUTTING ALL THIS

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:03.434
MONEY INTO WILDFIRE. BUT ANYWAY

02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:05.303
GO AHEAD MISTER RANDALL. YEAH

02:29:05.369 --> 02:29:07.338
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK-

02:29:07.405 --> 02:29:08.939
IN MINUTES ACTUALLYAND-

02:29:09.006 --> 02:29:10.941
EXCELLENT ANALYSIS- ANALYTICAL

02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:14.011
SUGGESTION- YEAH I'LL NOTE THAT

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:16.814
WE ALREADY DO- PROVIDED ANNUAL

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:17.915
SUMMARY OF EACH OF THE

02:29:17.982 --> 02:29:20.051
CATEGORIES IT YEAH- YOU HAVE

02:29:20.117 --> 02:29:21.752
OUTLINED. YOU KNOW WITHIN

02:29:21.819 --> 02:29:23.187
CALIFORNIA'S A STARTING POINT

02:29:23.254 --> 02:29:23.954
IN THE AND I'M SURE YOU'RE

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:24.922
FAMILIAR WITH IT WHAT WE

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:26.624
DETERMINES THE AB SIXTY SEVEN

02:29:26.691 --> 02:29:30.361
REPORT- WHICH DOES DETAIL- YOU

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:33.030
KNOW BOTH THE- AMOUNT ON EACH

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:36.000
YEAR- EACH OF THOSE CATEGORIES

02:29:36.067 --> 02:29:38.102
YOU'VE OUTLINED- PLUS NOW THAT

02:29:38.169 --> 02:29:39.937
THE AB SIXTY SEVEN REPORT HAS

02:29:40.004 --> 02:29:41.839
BEEN LAID OUT IN THAT DETAIL-

02:29:41.906 --> 02:29:43.874
FOR. CLOSE TO FIFTEEN YEARS NOW

02:29:43.941 --> 02:29:45.543
YOU CAN ALSO SEE THOSE LONG

02:29:45.609 --> 02:29:47.578
TERM TRENDS IN THOSE DETAILS-

02:29:47.645 --> 02:29:49.447
IT IT IS A GOOD QUESTION TO

02:29:49.513 --> 02:29:50.848
LOOK AT NEAR THE NATIONAL

02:29:50.915 --> 02:29:53.284
TRENDS IN EACH ONE- AND WE'D BE

02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:54.785
HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT. YOU

02:29:54.852 --> 02:29:56.587
KNOW JUST CAUTION- WE DON'T

02:29:56.654 --> 02:29:58.856
KNOW WHAT THE DATA IS IN EACH

02:29:58.923 --> 02:30:00.324
STATE AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD

02:30:00.391 --> 02:30:01.425
TYPICALLY FOR THAT ANALYSIS

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:04.395
TURN TO- THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT

02:30:04.462 --> 02:30:06.163
OF ENERGY- TO MAKE THOSE

02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:08.099
COMPARISONS WHICH WE CAN TRY-

02:30:08.165 --> 02:30:10.568
YOU KNOW HER ADDITIONALLY- NOT

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:11.669
TO PUT IT BACK IN THE HOSPITAL

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:13.704
BUSINESS- YOU KNOW WE WOULD

02:30:13.771 --> 02:30:15.206
ALSO PROBABLY REACH OUT TO MR

BORENSTEIN AND OTHERS- TO WORK

02:30:20.411 --> 02:30:21.011
WITH THEM ON THAT SAME ANALYSIS.

02:30:21.078 --> 02:30:21.779
HI WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU AND

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:23.948
ANYTHING YOU KNOW I'LL BE GLAD

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:26.150
TO TALK WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES. IN

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:29.787
THE ACADEMIC WORLD IF YOU WANT

02:30:29.854 --> 02:30:31.989
TO GET SOME HELP FROM THEM I'D

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:34.291
BE GLAD TO TALK TO THEM AS WELL.

02:30:34.358 --> 02:30:35.426
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

02:30:35.493 --> 02:30:37.862
LETTER AND OF COURSE RESEARCH

02:30:37.928 --> 02:30:40.464
INTO RESPONDING. IN A TIMELY

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:45.536
MANNER I MIGHT ADD. ALL RIGHT-

02:30:45.603 --> 02:30:48.806
SO WE HAVE DISCUSSED- SO

02:30:48.873 --> 02:30:50.875
SOMETHING THAT CAME UP WHEN THE

02:30:50.941 --> 02:30:53.043
ISO WAS HERE FOR AND YOU WERE

02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:54.512
HERE AS WELL FOR AN EARLIER

02:30:54.578 --> 02:30:56.113
DISCUSSION AS WELL AS THE

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:57.948
ENERGY COMMISSION. THERE WAS A

02:30:58.015 --> 02:31:00.050
BIT TOO MUCH GOING ON FOR MY TO

02:31:00.117 --> 02:31:03.220
DIG INTO IT TOO MUCH- BUT I'VE

02:31:03.287 --> 02:31:05.856
TALKED WITH COMMISSIONER-

02:31:05.923 --> 02:31:09.660
CLIFF. RIGHT RACETRACK SHAMAN

02:31:09.727 --> 02:31:11.862
WRECK SHAMAN SHAMAN RUSSIA

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:16.667
OFTEN. OF AND HE IS- CONCERNED

02:31:16.734 --> 02:31:19.403
ABOUT WHAT WE DO DURING THE

02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:22.406
WINTER ARE WHEN WE'VE GONE OVER

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:24.074
TO WHAT WILL PROBABLY BE

02:31:24.141 --> 02:31:26.177
LARGELY SOLAR AND WIND SOME

02:31:26.243 --> 02:31:30.448
GEOTHERMAL- THE PROBLEM IS WIND

02:31:30.514 --> 02:31:33.150
AND SOLAR. ARE NOT

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:34.819
COMPLEMENTARY DURING THE WINTER

02:31:34.885 --> 02:31:37.087
OFFSHORE WIND GOES DOWN WITH

02:31:37.154 --> 02:31:40.324
SOLAR GOES DOWN IN THE WINTER-

02:31:40.391 --> 02:31:41.959
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LAND WIND

02:31:42.026 --> 02:31:43.761
BUT THAT'S NOT TERRIBLY

02:31:43.828 --> 02:31:47.865
RELIABLE HERE IN THE STATE- AND

02:31:47.932 --> 02:31:50.267
WE CAN GET SOME SORT OF BALANCE

02:31:50.334 --> 02:31:51.302
PARTICULARLY WERE WILLING TO

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:55.339
IMPORT SAY WYOMING WIND- IF

02:31:55.406 --> 02:31:57.141
THEY HAVE MORE DURING THE

02:31:57.208 --> 02:31:59.076
WINTER. THEN THEY CAN USE-

02:31:59.143 --> 02:32:02.012
ALSO- IMPORTING HYDRO FROM THE

02:32:02.079 --> 02:32:04.648
PACIFIC BUT I THINK WE NEED TO

02:32:04.715 --> 02:32:06.417
JUST LOOK AT THIS IN IN MORE

02:32:06.484 --> 02:32:10.387
DETAIL. I HAVE SEEN. OUR

02:32:10.454 --> 02:32:12.923
ESTIMATES OF THE IMBALANCE BY

02:32:12.990 --> 02:32:20.731

MOST IMPORTANTLY AND WHAT'S IN

02:35:47.504 --> 02:35:50.541
FRONT OF US RIGHT NOW. IS THE-

02:35:50.607 --> 02:35:52.242
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

WHERE ALTERNATELY THE RETURNING

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:49.466
CUSTOMERS WILL PAY- A SURCHARGE

02:41:49.533 --> 02:41:52.836

INCREMENTAL COST OF SERVING

02:41:54.204 --> 02:41:56.339
THEM FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS-

02:42:03.847 --> 02:42:05.615
IS REQUIRED TO HAVE-

02:42:05.682 --> 02:42:07.084
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE LETTERS OF

02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:09.152
CREDIT ARE RELATIVELY SMALL

02:42:09.219 --> 02:42:10.220
COMPARED TO THE COST OF

CURRENT ESTIMATES AND THIS

02:42:16.693 --> 02:42:18.962
COULD CHANGE- SINCE SOME OF

02:42:19.029 --> 02:42:20.497
THIS IS BASED ON FORWARD ENERGY

02:42:20.564 --> 02:42:23.533
PRICES- AND THOSE WILL OFTEN

02:42:23.600 --> 02:42:24.367
THERE'S A RAPIDLY CHANGING

02:42:24.434 --> 02:42:27.237
RIGHT NOW- ABOUT 40% OF W. C.

02:42:27.304 --> 02:42:28.905
ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY WILL SEE A

02:42:28.972 --> 02:42:31.208
SLIGHT RATE DECREASE. WHEN THEY

02:42:31.274 --> 02:42:34.244
RETURN TO ADDISON SERVICE ON

02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:36.713

02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:37.647
CUSTOMERS TO LOW INCOME

02:42:37.714 --> 02:42:39.516
CUSTOMERS- AND THEN THE

02:42:39.583 --> 02:42:41.685
REMAINING 60% THE NON LOW

02:42:41.751 --> 02:42:43.520
INCOME CUSTOMERS WILL LIKELY

02:42:43.587 --> 02:42:45.455
SEE BETWEEN A POINT EIGHT CENT

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:47.691
AND A PENNY INCREASE ARM AND

02:42:47.757 --> 02:42:48.992
RATES THAT AVERAGES OUT TO

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:51.094
ABOUT TEN DOLLARS. A MONTH SO

02:42:51.161 --> 02:42:55.265
NOT INSIGNIFICANT- RATE CHANGE

02:42:55.332 --> 02:42:58.101
FOR ABOUT 60% OF THE CUSTOMERS-

02:42:58.168 --> 02:42:59.936
YEAH I DO WANT TO BUILD ON

02:43:00.003 --> 02:43:01.304
SOMETHING PRESENT BACHELOR SAID

02:43:01.371 --> 02:43:03.273
ON IN TERMS OF MONITORING THE

02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:05.842
HEALTH OF THE ENTITIES- WE DO

02:43:05.909 --> 02:43:07.844
VERY CLOSELY MONITOR HEALTH OF

02:43:07.911 --> 02:43:09.479
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES-

02:43:09.546 --> 02:43:11.948
AND HAVE- QUARTERLY MEETINGS

02:43:12.015 --> 02:43:15.418
WITH THEM- WORKING THROUGH-

02:43:15.485 --> 02:43:18.188
THEIR- THEIR FINANCES THEIR

02:43:18.255 --> 02:43:20.790
RATINGS- THERE TO MONITOR THEIR

02:43:20.857 --> 02:43:22.893
HEALTH AND I HAVE- SITUATIONAL

02:43:22.959 --> 02:43:24.127
AWARENESS IN CASE WE NEED TO

02:43:24.194 --> 02:43:25.829
GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING-

02:43:25.896 --> 02:43:27.531
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME

02:43:27.597 --> 02:43:29.232
REGULATORY JURISDICTION OVER

02:43:29.299 --> 02:43:31.368
THE CCA'S- WE DON'T HAVE

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:33.703
SIMILAR MEETINGS WITH THEM- IN

02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:35.872
THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE- ONE

02:43:35.939 --> 02:43:38.375
STUDY SEE. I DECLARED FOR

02:43:38.441 --> 02:43:39.943
BANKRUPTCY WE DID START HAVING

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:43.547
CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL CCA- TO

02:43:43.613 --> 02:43:45.348
GET INFORMATION THROUGH THEM

02:43:45.415 --> 02:43:50.420
ON- WHAT THE STATE OF FINANCE

02:43:50.487 --> 02:43:53.857
THIS. FOR C. INTO- WE HAVE THE

02:43:53.924 --> 02:43:55.592
DIRECT INFORMATION BUT WE DID

02:43:55.659 --> 02:43:57.027
GET INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE

02:43:57.093 --> 02:43:59.362
THAT- OR TO TRY TO HAVE SOME

02:43:59.429 --> 02:44:00.363
ASSURANCES THAT THERE'S NOT

02:44:00.430 --> 02:44:02.432
GONNA BE A CHAIN REACTION-

02:44:02.499 --> 02:44:06.203
AMONG OTHER CCA'S- OVER THE

02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:07.904
SUMMER BASED ON PEOPLE GETTING

02:44:07.971 --> 02:44:10.006
NERVOUS ABOUT THE OVERALL

02:44:10.073 --> 02:44:12.909
FINANCIAL MODEL WE DON'T. THANK

02:44:12.976 --> 02:44:13.510
THAT'S A RISK BASED ON WHAT WE

02:44:13.577 --> 02:44:15.879
KNOW SO FAR- AND WE DO THINK

02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:18.148
THAT THE SITUATION WOULD W. C.

02:44:18.215 --> 02:44:22.185
E. R. IS FAIRLY UNIQUE. ARE

02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:24.988
GIVEN- THEY'RE BASICALLY

02:44:25.055 --> 02:44:26.256
STARTED SERVING CUSTOMERS AT

02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:26.923
THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE

02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:30.627
PANDEMIC- THAT THEY HAVE A- A

02:44:30.694 --> 02:44:32.195
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBER

02:44:32.262 --> 02:44:34.464
OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS. AND

02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:36.333
ADD TO PERSONALLY HIGH NUMBER

02:44:36.399 --> 02:44:38.602
OF FOLKS WHO WERE UNABLE TO PAY

02:44:38.668 --> 02:44:40.036
THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS DURING THE

02:44:40.103 --> 02:44:42.339
UP ENERGY KERR DURING THE

02:44:42.405 --> 02:44:45.242
PANDEMIC. NO I APPRECIATE THAT

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:48.712
AND I THINK CLEARLY WE'RE GOING

02:44:48.778 --> 02:44:49.746
TO. NO SEE THIS HOPEFULLY JUST

02:44:49.813 --> 02:44:52.415
AS A RARE OCCURRENCE A RARE

02:44:52.482 --> 02:44:55.585
EVENT AND I BELIEVE THAT THE

02:44:55.652 --> 02:44:58.588
STABILITY OF CCA'S IS SORT OF.

02:44:58.655 --> 02:45:00.790
FUNDAMENTAL AND THE THEIR

02:45:00.857 --> 02:45:02.792
DECISION MAKING IS. POSITIONING

02:45:02.859 --> 02:45:05.328
THEM FOR SUCCESS DOWN THE ROAD

02:45:05.395 --> 02:45:08.064
BUT I L. COULD ALSO. SIGNAL

02:45:08.131 --> 02:45:10.300
THAT THERE'S SOME DEFICIENCY

02:45:10.367 --> 02:45:13.270
AND HOW OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF

02:45:13.336 --> 02:45:15.005
THE OF THE FINANCES ARE

02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:17.140
STRUCTURED AND HOW THE LONG

02:45:17.207 --> 02:45:18.942
TERM VIABILITY COULD BE

02:45:19.009 --> 02:45:21.811
JEOPARDIZED IF. THERE SOMETHING

02:45:21.878 --> 02:45:23.747
MORE SYSTEMIC AT PLAY AND SO I

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:27.150
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. TO

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:28.685
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS

02:45:28.752 --> 02:45:30.253
WE'RE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE.

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:31.721
OUR CONVERSATIONS HEALTHY

02:45:31.788 --> 02:45:34.190

02:45:34.257 --> 02:45:37.060
UNDERSTAND- THEIR THOUGHTS AND-

02:45:37.127 --> 02:45:38.628
BUT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

02:45:38.695 --> 02:45:40.530
THAT DID HAPPEN ON THE SERVER

02:45:40.597 --> 02:45:43.733
SIDE UP COMING. AND WE THINK WE

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:46.836
