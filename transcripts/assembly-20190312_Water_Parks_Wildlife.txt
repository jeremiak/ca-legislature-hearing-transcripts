IS ONE OF THE COMMITTEE HEARD IN PASSED LAST YEAR AND SO WE'RE ASKING -- TO CONTINUE THAT AND NOW ME TO RESTATE SOME COMMENTS THAT I THAT I HAVE OFFERED BEFORE AS WELL THE STRESS WHAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS. ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS IN NATURE SEEMS LIKE IT OUT TO BE A BIRTH RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW I BECAME A PRODUCT OF THE ACCESS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS HAD TO OFFER I'M AN IMMIGRANT TO THIS COUNTRY IS BORN IN MAY HE GO AND MY FIRST CONNECTION EXPOSURE TO THE OF STATE PARKS NATIONAL PARKS. HAPPEN HERE -- I AND WE ENJOYED SO MANY THINGS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I THINK OFTEN WE MAY FORGET OR TAKE FOR GRANTED I GREW UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO EVEN THE ASSEMBLY WAS ONLY LIKE TWO HOURS AWAY. I DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THESE CONNECTIONS UNTIL LATER IN MY LIFE AND THEN ESPECIALLY ONCE I BEGAN TO WORK WITH THAT THE NOT DOORS TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT THIS WITH ONE FAMILIES. AS I THINK IT'S ALSO ARE EASY TO OVERLOOK THE HARD FOUGHT BATTLE SUPERSTAR THESE PLACES -- THAT WE PUT IN A LOT OF WORK IN INVEST ALLOW FOR THE CONNECTION AND ACCESS OF THE COMMUNITIES IN THE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT THEM TO STAY CONNECTED AND INVESTED. AND CONTINUE TO BE THE PRESENT AND FUTURE STEWARDS OF THESE LANDSCAPES. AS THE AS THE DEMOGRAPHICS CONTINUE TO SHIFT.

ON BEHALF OF COMMITTEE NATURE CONNECTION FRIENDS OF THOSE ON HE SAID I REGIONAL OPEN SPACE DISTRICT ANNALS THANK YOU LIST NEVER LAND TRUST IN SUPPORT ALRIGHT I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE RUSSIAN. SPEAKING OPPOSITION OUT IN BACK TODAY'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS BILL. THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU MISS VAUGHN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I RECOGNIZE YOUR YOUR YOUR NEED FOR REACHING OUT TO GIVE ACCESS TO TO MORE PEOPLE. ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU IS THE ABILITY TO MAKE IT SO ALL PEOPLE HAVE. AN OPEN ACCESS FOR THIS AND WELL. OFTENTIMES WE HEAR THE TERMS YOU KNOW. IS LIMITED TO THE PEOPLE WHO GET A REDUCE MAIL ARE. THERE FOSTER USE OR THERE ARE OTHER BEFORE BECAUSE THEIR LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FORGET IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THE CLOSEST TO OUR PARKS. ARE EXCLUDED BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET CERTAIN. BRACKETS. HOW DO WE OVERCOME THAT? IS THERE A WAY TO WORK THROUGH YOUR BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW ALL PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME ENJOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE. SO HOW DO WE OPEN THAT DOOR AND AS TO THE LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL THAT WILL BE NON EXCLUSIONARY IF YOU WILL [inaudible] HELPING OTHERS. MANY OF THOSE OTHERS WHO ACTUALLY LIVE WITHIN FIVE TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THE ENTRANCE OF THOSE PARKS. DON'T GIVE THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITY I AND I I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS -- CERTAINLY AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS. THE AREA A DO YOU AND HAVING SERVED ON A SCHOOL BOARD I SAW HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS I SERVE THAT LIVED MINUTES FROM THE OCEAN ARE PARK NEVER GOT -- TO VISIT THE OCEAN -- PARK SO I VERY MUCH -- RESPECT AND UNDERSTAND AT THAT POSITION I'D LOVE TO LIVE OPEN THIS UP TO EVERYONE ON THE FUNDING WOULD BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IF WE WERE OPENING IT UP I THINK THE TARGET -- HERE HAS TO DO WITH THOSE THAT ARE MOST DISADVANTAGED ON THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE'S NOT OTHERS WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED IN IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE STOP. ENSURING THAT WE WORK TO HELP EVERY FOR PURPOSES OF THIS BILL IT IS LIMITED IN SCOPE -- IT ALSO MEANS IT'S LIMITED IN FUNDING BUT CERTAINLY IF THERE WERE WAYS IN TERMS OF INCREASING ACCESS -- GENERALLY THOSE WOULD. BE IDEAS THAT I WOULD BE VERY OPEN TO AT THIS BILL DID GET OUT WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT LAST YEAR AND WE INCLUDED AN AMENDMENT IN THE BILL. ABOUT A ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS -- THAT WAS NOT LIMITED TO ANY ONE PARTICULAR GROUP IS VERY FOCUSED ON MY VERY SPECIFIC AREA AND SO THAT THE BILL ENDED UP BEING VETOED -- BUT CERTAINLY THERE IS MUCH WORK TO DO ON ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. AND AND THAT THAT'S WHERE THE CONFLICT IS FOR ME THE BEING SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AT THE VERY END. I STAYED NEUTRAL IN COMMITTEE AND TRY TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE FOR SOLUTIONS IN RESOLVING A LOT OF THAT NOT ONLY YOUR RIGHT THE GOVERNOR DID VETO. THE ACTION AS IT GOT TO HIS DESK. WITH ALL ALL OF THE SAME FOCUS THAT I HAD THEN I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE IN TRYING. TO SEE THAT WE CAN CRAFT A BILL THAT HAS LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE INCLUSIVE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU AN ICE. SHARE DISTRICTS THAT -- ARE SIMILAR IN KIND. I HAVE A 100% OF YOU SOMEBODY. AND I'VE GOT SOME. WHAT'S CLASS WONDERS OF THE WORLD. AND THE TOP SEVEN ACTUALLY. ONE OF AND IT'S DISHEARTENING TO KNOW THAT STUDENTS. THAT ARE JUST MINUTES AWAY FROM THE GATE. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO SEE SUCH WONDERS. CAN'T GET IN. AS OUR LIMITED SO IF YOU AND I COULD WORK ON THAT AND IF THE CHAIR WOULD HELP US TO WORK ON ACHIEVING A A SOLUTION. THAT BRIDGES THIS AND ALLOWS. PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE TO HAVE THAT SAME ACCESS THAT THIS IS TRYING TO GET FOR JUST A CERTAIN GROUP. I WOULD BE TICKLED TO DEATH SO. I'LL STAY OFF OF IT JUST TO GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK IN DIALOGUE ON TODAY IF THERE'S A COMMITMENT ON YOUR PART TO WORK ON THAT. I AM HAPPY TO I MEAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION A A THINK THAT THE BILL IS IS LIMITED IN SCOPE BUT I CERTAINLY AM HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH YOU IN TERMS OF THINKING. MORE BROADLY HOW WE GET THOSE THAT LIVE NEAR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NO ACCESS TO A OR LIMITED ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE NATURAL SPACES. THANK THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. LET ME STOP IS TO POUR MORE QUICK. AND THEN WILL -- TAKE YOUR QUESTION. WELL WILL HAVE A ROLL CALL AND WELCOME TO OUR YOU MEMBER BRIAN DAHLE. LET'S ESTABLISH QUORUM FIRST NAME WILL WILL GO BACK TO YOUR QUESTION AFTER [inaudible] THE DOCTORS [inaudible] QUESTION. EDUARDO GARCIA PRESENT GALLAGHER [inaudible] BIGELOW. CHOI HERE CHIU [inaudible] DELHI HERE [inaudible] FRIEDMAN [inaudible] CRISTINA GARCIA [inaudible] GLORIA [inaudible] KALRA LEVINE [inaudible] RUBIO [inaudible] SALAS [inaudible] WOOD. ALL RIGHT LET ME JUST MAKE A COMMENT I HAPPY. TO SEE THE TAPE THE CONVERSATION AS IT RELATES TO THE KIND OF THE SCOPE BY. I WOULD GAS AND I DON'T KNOW THE DEMOGRAPHICS SPECIFICALLY OF THE FOLKS IN YOUR DISTRICT MISTER BIGELOW BUT I WOULD GUESS THAT. SOCIO ECONOMICS -- PROBABLY WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR -- IF -- THE POPULATION ARE UNABLE. TO VISIT YOSEMITE PARK IT I THINK IN THE INTENTION IS VERY SIMILAR AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE SAME GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS -- MEET SOME OF THE SAME REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE REFERRING TO HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR. NARAL SCOPE OF A OF THE BILL BUT HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE YOU AND THE AUTHOR. ON THAT SO THE DOCTOR HAD A QUESTION THAT. THANK YOU CHAIR -- I HEAR YOUR POINTS ARE. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE SPECIFIC SO. IF THE OP. MORE OF FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE OR FOR OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE SO -- PARTICULARLY FOR THE I THINK THAT YOUR EMPHASIS ALSO ON THE CHILDREN OF A DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY WAR. NOT PEOPLE OF BUT AT THE RISK POPULATION -- UNDERSERVED. THE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OF THE CATEGORIES -- BUT THE IF THE FUNDING WAS A MAY DEVELOP OR HOW WOULD YOU. GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE IT IS SAYS THROUGH THE SCHOOL AN OUTDOOR. OF VISITED POOL PLANS SO OR FAMILIES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE -- OUTDOOR VACATION AND APPLY FOR IT THE BECAUSE HAS SOON. AT THE EXPERIENCE OR CHILDREN. WILL HAVE A FOR OUTDOOR NATURE MADE THAT WOULD BE ORG BENEFICIAL. THE WHETHER YOU HAVE MONEY ONE NOT THE WAS TO FAMILIESTHAT MAY NOT HAVE TENDS. TO GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITY TO ALL OF THE WAR -- EXPERIENCE SO IS A NOT THE MMHM MMHM. SOMETIMES A MONEY ISSUE -- SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY HOW THIS FUND. WILL HELP. HOW YOU GONNA IMPLEMENT THAT THE FUNDS ARE MADE ABOUT? THE IDEA OF THIS PARTICULAR FIND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IT COULD BE AND NON PROFIT CAN BE A BREAK FOR A BROADER AN ENTITY IT CAN BE A REGIONAL ENTITY WHAT APPLY FOR GRANTS TO THE DEPARTMENT. OF UP PARKS AND SO THAT THAT'S REALLY HOW THE PROGRAM WOULD BE ADMINISTERED -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT UP MODEL OF FUNDING OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES FOR STUDENTS AND TARA MONEY WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE AND A DIFFERENT. ENTITIES OF THE A COMMUNITY ORDER APPLY FOR PLAN. LIKE APPLICATION BASED I SEE. AND THEN ORNEA. SO THAT THE POPULATION WILL HAVE TO BE YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE YOU WALK DISADVANTAGED WHO ARE AT RISK FAMILY. YOU WOULD PROVE THAT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU ARE FACILITATING IS TARGETED TO LOW INCOME AND I WANT TO BE CLOSE CLEAR THAT LOW INCOME IS NOT ETHNIC OR RACE BASED. FLOWING COMPANY FOR DISEASE YEAH DISADVANTAGED AND OTHER CATEGORIES HAVE YOU DONE ANY -- THAT ONE'S DUTY -- ONLY DISADVANTAGED -- AT RISK. OF POPULATION WOULD HAVE A MUCH LESS EXPERIENCE OF THE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE OF VERSUS. SO TO SPEAK -- WENT TO FAMILY MORE EXPERIENCES HISTORICALLY IN RESEARCH SAYS YES THAT THOSE THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED HAVE LESS ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS. THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED. THANK YOU MISTER DALI AND WALKING TO GET.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWO SEVENTY THREE WHAT PER HER PROHIBIT FOR TRAPPING IN THE SALE ROB FOR IN CALIFORNIA HISTORICALLY TRAPPING FOR FOR WAS A LARGE INDUSTRY. AD BUT TODAY FOR TRAPPING CALIFORNIA IT IS DONE AN EXTREMELY SMALL SCALE RELATIVE TO ITS HEYDAY IS IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN LIFE THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE TRAPPERS WHO RECEIVED AN ESTIMATED REVENUE AT TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE TOTAL FOR FOR SALES. HOWEVER CONTINUES BEING INHERENTLY CRUEL AND INHUMANE PRACTICE FOR THE ANIMALS TRAPPED AND CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS KILLING PADS OR PROTECTED WILDLIFE. FOR TRAPPING CALIFORNIA'S ALSO SUBSIDIZED BY TAXPAYERS DESPITE REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW FOR TRAPPING PROGRAM TO COVER ITS OWN COST TRAPPING LICENSE FEES DO NOT COVER THE ACTUAL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THE STATE'S FOR TRAPPING PROGRAM. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEASON COST OF A TRAPPING LICENSE WAS ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN DOLLARS. BASED ON THE MANAGEMENT OF LICENSE ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THIS IS LESS THAN IT SHOULD BE TO GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE TO COVER THE COST OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM ARE THE TRAPPING PROGRAM. JUST FOUR YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION BANNED COMMERCIAL BOBCAT TRAPPING AND PART BASED ON SIMILAR CONCERNS REGARD THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. AB TWO SEVENTY THREE WOULD PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE WILDLIFE FROM CRUEL AN OUTDATED PRACTICE THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE TRAPPING OF FOR BURYING OR NON GAME MAMMAL FOR THE PURPOSES OF RECREATION OR COMMERCE INFER. PROHIBIT THE SALE PROFFER ELIMINATE THE LICENSE FOR FOR DEALERS FOR AGENTS HOWEVER THIS BILL WOULD MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO TRAP IN ORDER TO MANAGE WILDLIFE WHICH MAYBE INJURING CROPS OR PROPERTY. FOR THAT REASON I RESPECT LAST FOR NIGHT OUT. THANK YOU EVER WITNESSES SPEAK. GOOD MORNING I'M JENNY KEATING WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE FIVE YEARS AGO A SINGLE TRAPPER OPERATING ALONG THE BOUNDARY OF JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK KILLED ENOUGH BOBCATS IN ONE SEASON. TO SEVERELY DEPLETE THE LOCAL POPULATION OF THIS SPECIES TURNING AN ANIMAL FREQUENTLY OBSERVED AND APPRECIATED BY TOURISTS AND LOCALS ALIKE INTO A SPECIES NOW FIVE YEARS LATER. THAT IS STILL RARELY SEEN. IN RESPONSE CALIFORNIA WISELY BAND BOBCAT TRAPPING IN THE STATE BUT THE PROBLEM ISN'T LIMITED TO BOBCATS AS APPROXIMATELY A DOZEN NATIVE SPECIES ARE STILL TARGETED FOR THEIR FOR LAST YEAR A SINGLE TRAPPER IN AROUND THE RECENTLY DESIGNATED SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS NATIONAL MONUMENT. KILLED MORE THAN A HUNDRED GRAY FOXES. THE SAME GRADE GIRL MONUMENT WAS DECLARED IN PART INSTANCE. IN SIGNIFICANT PART TO PROTECT WILDLIFE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. YET CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A SINGLE FUR TRAPPER TO SYSTEMATICALLY DEPLETE THE WILDLIFE IN THIS AREA TO THE DETRIMENT OF NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE MONUMENT ANNUALLY. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE ARE MORE FOXES IN OTHER REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA THE I'M REGULATING UNREGULATED TRAPPING THAT OCCURS UNDER CURRENT LAW CAN HAVE REAL IMPACTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AFFECTING WILDLIFE CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND RECREATION IN THE AREA. FOR THE VISITORS AND RESIDENTS OF JOSHUA TREE WHO LOST THEIR BOBCATS IT MATTERED. FOR THE VISITORS OF SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS NATIONAL MONUMENT WHO ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO SEE A GRAY FOX IT MATTERS. BY PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL FOR TRAPPING IN CALIFORNIA AB TWO SEVENTY SIX THREE WILL PROTECT PROTECT NOT JUST THE WILDLIFE AND ECOLOGY OF THE STATE. BUT ALSO THE TOURISM DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TIED TO HEALTHY WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. THE OUTDOOR INDUSTRY FOUNDATION ESTIMATES THAT MORE THAN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENGAGE IN WILDLIFE VIEWING IN SOME MANNER. CONTRIBUTING OVER THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. IN SOME WHETHER YOU LOOK AT IT ECOLOGICALLY ECONOMICALLY OR ETHICALLY ENDING FOR TRAPPING IN CALIFORNIA IS LONG OVERDUE I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. HI. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I'M JUDY MAN CREW SO SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA HAS PROBABLY MAINTAINED ITSELF AS A LEADER IN COMPASSION DESPITE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON THAT HAS DECLARED AN ALL OUT WAR ON WILDLIFE. DURING A BRIEF TIME FOR MANY SPECIES ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE BEING DELISTED AND TEETERING ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION SUCH AS OUR GRAY WOLVES WE MUST STAND STRONG ON THE ANIMAL SIDE. COMMERCIAL FOR TRAPPING IS ECOLOGICALLY ECONOMICALLY IN AT THE GLEE BAD POLICY ALL THE WAY AROUND. TRAPPING IS HORRENDOUSLY CRUEL AS CONSUMERS ARE LEARNING VIA SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS SHOWING TERRIFIED ANIMALS CROUCHING IN FEAR TRYING DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE THEIR IMMINENT FATE. TRAPS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE SO IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR TRAPPERS TO FIND HOUSEHOLD PETS BIRDS ENDANGERED AND RED LISTED SPECIES AND OTHER ANIMALS DYING OR DEAD. TRAPPERS CALL THESE ANIMALS TRASH KILLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ECONOMIC VALUE TO THEM. SINCE ENFORCEMENT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE HERE OF ANIMALS LEFT FOR DAYS AND THESE TRAPS CAUSING THEM TO SUCCUMB TO EXPOSURE HEAT FROSTBITE SHOCK ARE SLOW STARVATION. IF THE ANIMALS ARE STILL ALIVE WHEN THEY ARE RETRIEVED THE METHOD OF KILLING THEM WITHOUT DAMAGING THEIR FERVOR IS TYPICALLY BY WAY OF STRANGULATION. BEATINGS OR STOMPING THEM TO DEATH. THE COMMERCIAL TRAPPING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS DE FACTO TAXPAYERS SUBSIDIZE SUBSIDIZING THE COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION OF NATIVE WILDLIFE FOR THE BENEFIT OF A FEW LACKS MORAL OR FISCAL SENSE. TIME AND TIME AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS SHOW UP TO THE POLLS AND VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY TO PROTECT THEM WE VALUE OUR WILDLIFE ALIVE RATHER THAN AS COMMODITIES TO BE KILLED SKIN. AND SOLD PLEASE VOTE YES ON A. B. TWO SEVENTY THREE AND PUT FOR TRAPPING IN HISTORY BOOKS WHERE BELONGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND IS GLORIA. I'LL OPEN IT UP FOR A SUPPORT. THOSE -- WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD. NICHOLAS SACKETT SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION IN SUPPORT.

IF WILL MAKE SOME ROOM UP HERE FOR THEM PLEASE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ONE OF THREE GOOD MORNING WELCOME. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS NANCY DANIEL I'M WITH THE INTERNATIONAL FOR FEDERATION FOR THE AMERICAS REGION. AND I WANT TO CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT TRAPPING IN NORTH AMERICA WHILE FOR VERY SPECIES IT'S A VITAL TOOL FOR WILDLIFE MANAGERS. WHO ARE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY THROUGH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND LAWS AND TRAPPING IS USED FOR MANY REASONS A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE TRAP TO PROTECT OUR ENDANGERED SPECIES? FOR THOSE OF YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WHOOPING CRANE AND MANY ENDANGERED BIRDS TO NEST ALONG THE GREAT LAKES WOULD BE IN DANGER TODAY IF WE WERE NOT TRAPPING SOME OF THE THE SPECIES THAT PREY ON THOSE. ENDANGERED SPECIES LIKE HEIAU DIS IN FOX'S SO WE PROTECT TO MONITOR AND MANAGE ENDANGERED SPECIES WE ALSO A TRAP FOR THE RE INTRODUCTION OF SPECIES TO THEIR ORIGINAL HABITATS. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THE PREVENTION OF WILDLIFE DAMAGE TO HUMAN PROPERTY. THE PROTECTION OF CROPS FOR DISEASE MANAGEMENT WE DON'T WANT. RABIES AND DISTEMPER IN OUR BACKYARD BASE OF SPECIES. AND CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THE TRAPS ARE SELECTIVE AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TRACK TESTING AND THE U. S. AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE STATE. THE STATE'S HAVE POURED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO TROPPER RESEARCH OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SELECTIVE IN HUMANE. THE US IS A SIGNATORY TO THE U. S. E. U. AGREED MINUTES WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT -- REGULATING HUMANE TRAPPING OF FOR BEARING SPECIES THERE'S THE AGREEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL HUMANE TRAPPING STANDARDS WE HAVE TO I SO STANDARDS IN PLACE FOR HUMANE TRAPPING IN THE UNITED STATES. AND WE ALSO HAVE BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND TRACK TESTING FACILITY IN CANADA WHICH IS THE STATE OF THE ART FACILITY WERE ALL THE TRAPS ARE TESTED FOR HUMANE S.. SO WE OPPOSE THIS BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED REASONS THANK YOU. HI MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS MANAGE WATERFOWL HABITAT. AND WETLANDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BOB TRAPPING IS A VERY NECESSARY WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT TOOL. WHAT WHEN MANAGERS -- HAVE TO PROTECT THEIR WAY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE FROM PASS THE COMPROMISE SAY THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEVEE SYSTEMS THAT. SURROUND THOSE WETLANDS. MANAGERS ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS PREDATION A WATER FOUNTAIN ASSN BROODS -- FROM NUISANCE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS PEST SPECIES THESE WOULD BE LIKE RACCOONS SKUNKS POSSUM -- MANY OF THE SPECIES THE SPECIES ARE OVER ABUNDANT. IN AREAS BECAUSE FRANKLY ARE WETLAND ECOSYSTEMS NAY NO LAW AND NATURALLY -- WE NO LONGER HAVE -- ANNUAL LARGE SCALE FLOODING SAY UP IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY THAT WOULD. THE ARTICLE A COAL PREDATORS FROM THE ECO SYSTEM. LOCAL TRAPPERS IN RURAL AREAS -- WHO OFTEN HAVE YEARS OF EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE AND EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLING THE SPECIES? TO US THEY'RE VERY VALUABLE ASSET AND SHOULD BE PROTECTED. AND INCLUDED IN THE WHOLE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT REGIME. BUT THIS BILL BY AFFECTING WE EFFECTIVELY REMOVING THEM -- FROM THE WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT A QUICK EQUATION WOULD LEAVE OUT WILDLIFE MANAGERS WITH FEWER OPTIONS LESS FLEXIBILITY. AND FRANKLY IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THEIR COSTS IN MANY WETLAND MANAGEMENT COSTS ARE ALREADY EXCEEDINGLY HIGH. SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD SEE SOME WETLAND OWNERS -- HAVING A A DIFFICULTY GETTING BY YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. ON THE AT THE END -- THE THE RESULTS JUST GONNA BE FEWER CONSERVATION BENEFITS ON THE GROUND SO WE DROP OPPOSITION THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE HEARD FROM THE TWO WITNESSES SOMEONE OPEN IT UP. FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO JUST STATE YOUR NAME OR OFFICE OPPOSING POSITION DENNIS I'LL BE ON A OUT OF WITH THE GOVERNOR GRAY FEW DISSOCIATION BUT I'M ALSO PITCH HITTING TODAY BECAUSE SHE'S DOWN PERCENT ANOTHER BILL. FOR NO ALL CREAMERS FOR FARM BUREAU WE'RE CONCERNED WELL DEPRIVATION PERMITS ARE. ARE EXEMPTED IF THERE AREN'T SHOPPERS THAT HAVE THE SKILLS AND THE EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THE DECORATION FOR MANY WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- TO SAVE LIVESTOCK THANK YOU. BILL GAINES REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELK FOUNDATION IN THE WILD SHEEP FOUNDATION IN THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN UNDERSTATE ARCHERY ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE DEALT WITH IN FRONT OF THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. AND IN PUBLIC FORUM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NICK VILLA CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. GIVE CAPITA WEST HOLLYWOOD RESIDENT AND FOR INFORMATION COUNTS OF AMERICA OPPOSE THIS BILL IS A BIG NORTH THE SCIENCE BEHIND -- BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WILDLIFE CONSERVATION ALLOWED LIKE POPULATION MANAGEMENT AS SUPPORTED BY GROUP SO YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN THINK LIKE THANK WORLD WILDLIFE FUND IN THE WORLD ORGANISATION FOR ANIMAL HEALTH. MICHAEL LELAND FOR COMMISSION USA AYE OPPOSED BILL. MATT GRAY ON BEHALF OF TAXPAYERS FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY THE CONSERVATION BIOLOGISTS IN OUR ASSOCIATION OPPOSE THE BILL BASED ON THE MERITS AND SOME OF THE STATEMENTS EARLIER WERE FACTUALLY INCORRECT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY. SO YOU KNOW NOW SIR -- SPEAKING OF GOING BACK TO DÃ­AS ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SIGNALED BLOW IT UP THIS BILL I IT'S HARD OF THE AUTHOR AND I GET ALONG REALLY WELL IN ON THIS ONE WE PROBABLY SEE THINGS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- I WAS ALL SAD WHEN I SAW YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE YES I KNOW IT'S HARD -- BUT IT'S DIFFICULT. I THINK YOU HEARD SOME OF THE CONTENTS. THAT THAT ARE GENUINE I THINK THERE IS SOME. SOME GENUINE IS HERE TO WANTING THIS TO SAVE. THE BOBCATS THE COYOTES AND EVERYTHING BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTS THAT WE CAN'T IGNORE. THESE ARE ALSO PREDATORS. AND THEY DO FEED ON THE WILDLIFE. AND THEY DO FEED. ON THE BABY CALVES AND THE BABY SHE I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY. OF A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN. MY KIDS WERE IN FOR H. AND SHOWING -- ANIMALS AND THEY HAD. MY SON HAD. CHEAP THAT WERE BEING SHOWN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY [inaudible] AND ONE NIGHT. AN ATTACK OF COYOTES DECIMATED HIS FLOCK. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU JUST WHAT OCCURRED ON THAT NIGHT A FEMALE. SINGULARLY. CAME IN AND TOOK DOWN. NINETEEN DAVEY LAMBS. FIVE MOTHER USE. WHEN I CAME OUT TO FEED AT SIX AM IN THE MORNING? I FOUND THE DEAD CARCASSES OF MOST. MANY OF THOSE BABY LAMBS. THEIR ENTIRE FROM THE CENTER THEIR SPINE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THEIR SIDE. THEIR ENTIRE HIDE WAS DRAGGING ON THE GROUND AND ALL YOU COULD SEE WHERE THEIR RIBS. THE MOTHER IS BALLING FOR THEIR BABIES. IT WAS VERY SURREAL AND DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH. BUT BEING SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN AG. HAD TO DO WHAT HAD TO BE DONE. AND NOT EUTHANIZE THOSE ANIMALS THESE ANIMALS [inaudible] WERE UNCHANGED. AND WHAT THEY WERE DOING. WAS REPRODUCING AT AN ESCALATED SEPARATES. IT'S HARD IF YOU ARE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO YOU. TO KEEP THE POPULATION GROWTH IN CHECK. I DON'T ADVOCATE FOR THE ERADICATION OR THE ELIMINATION OF ALL. BECAUSE EACH HAS THEIR OWN PURPOSE IN THE WORLD AS PREDATORS TO KEEP OTHER THINGS IN CHECK. BUT YOU HEARD WHAT WAS HAPPENING AROUND THE GREAT LAKES YOU'VE HEARD IN OTHER AREAS WE HAVE IT IN THIS STATE ARE GREAT YOU GRATZ. BOTH BLUE AND WHITE. COME COMPROMISED AROUND STOCK FUNDS WATER PONDS WATERWAYS WHERE THEY NEST. BY THESE VERY CREATURES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND TAKING AWAY ALL THE TOOLS. WILL MAKE IT INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY FOR US AS A STATE. I THINK THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY. FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER. AND SOLVING THIS MAJOR PROBLEM I DO UNDERSTAND. THE FOR ISSUE. THINGS CHANGED. BUT THERE HAS TO BE A WAY FOR US TO WORK WITHOUT COMPLETELY BANNING OR TAKING THE TOOL OFF THE TABLE I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS RECOGNITION. OF THE DEPREDATION COMPONENT. WITH AN S.. BUT IT STILL IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE LANDOWNERS. CAN'T GET ACCESS TO THE STATE OR FEDERAL TRAPPER. PROGRAMS AND THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. FISH AND WILDLIFE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TRAPPERS LEFT IN THE STATE TO GO OUT AND DO THE JOB FOR EXAMPLE A TRAPPER THAT I USE. IT'S COMING FROM MENDOCINO COUNTY AND HE'S ONLY THERE ON CERTAIN DAYS. SO IF IT'S MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO LIVE WITH SOMEBODY WHO CAN'T CHECK THEIR TRAPS EVERYDAY AND HUMANELY ADJUST. FOR WHAT'S OCCURRING. SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS. MAYBE A LITTLE BROADER. AND MAYBE WORK ON IT SO MAYBE. AGAIN I'M NOT FOR LIKE A DIFFERENT HERE AND THERE. WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS BECAUSE WE DO GET ALONG. AND TRY TO FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THIS. BOTH FOR THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AND THE PEOPLE ARE IN THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE FOLKS. I'M GONNA RECOGNIZE ARE BAD ACTORS AND WE NEED [inaudible] TO PURGE THAT. BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY HUMANE AND DO THESE THINGS AND THE RIGHTEOUS WAYS. WE NEED TO USE ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US. FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ANIMALS AND AND FOR THE ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO SAY. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR I THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS -- THE BANNING OF FOR FOR COMMERCIAL -- USING RECREATIONAL AND DOES NOT STOP OBVIOUSLY YOU IS A LAND OPENER YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A TRAPPING PERMIT TO TO PROTECT YOUR OWN PROPERTY ON YOUR LAND -- AND AND SO I KNOW I KNOW RIGHT NOW I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT IS -- ALLOWING PEOPLE ON YOUR LAND TO TO DO IT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES SOMETIMES ALLOWS YOU TO ALSO PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY BUT THAT IS ALSO THE STATE SUBSIDIZING THEN -- THIS CONTROL KIND OF SITUATION AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THOSE WHO ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT TO PAY FOR NOT FOR THE STATE -- BASICALLY WILDLIFE. FUND TO BE TO BE PAYING FOR RIGHT AND THAT THAT THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY NEED WE CAN TALK MORE ON THAT WE CAN WORK DEFINITELY APPROPRIATIONS HM I I GET THAT PART ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. BUT WHAT I WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE IT AS THESE CREATURES ARE GIVING THEIR LIVES MAYBE WE CAN USE. IN SOME WAY. THE VALUE. OF THAT LIFE BEING GIVEN. EVERYTHING HAS A SANCTITY. I'VE I AGREED. I RECOGNIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WORK WITH. ALL OF THE PARTS WE DON'T JUST TRASH EVERYTHING. THANK YOU. WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM VICE CHAIR. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SOARED. BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T PROHIBIT FOR AT FOR INSTANCE HE W. A. -- FROM UTILIZING A TRAPPER NOW WHY WOULD YOU SAID ONLY THE COMMERCIAL USE THE COMMERCIAL SALE OF HER AND RECREATIONAL TRAPPING BUT SERVE THEIR PAIN A TRAPPER TO COME ON TO THEIR PROPERTY TO GUARD AGAINST PASSED TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY OR LAND YES THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THAT. THAT WOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED NOW WHERE IS THAT IN THE WELL IT'S CLEAR THIS IS OF THAT LICENSE. FOR THERE'S OTHER TRAPPING PERMITS. FISHING GAME CODE FORTY ONE POINT EIGHT ZERO AND FORTY ONE FIVE TWO SO THOSE THAT HAVE A LICENSE TO USE THAN SELL THE FOR THAT THEY CAN'T BE HAVE THE CELL I CAN'T HAVE A LICENSED ITSELF -- ANYMORE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE -- FOR TRAPPING FOR FOR PROTECTION OF PROPERTY FOR AYE INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROLLED HAS CONTROL RIGHT BUT I MEAN THAT AND I THINK THATTHAT IS. ULTIMATELY WHAT'S PART OF IT RIGHT IS LOOK I MEAN OUT I DON'T WEAR FOR YEAH BUT I THINK PROBABLY A LOT OF PEOPLE DOWN RIGHT BUT YEAH BUT THERE IS THERE IS A MARKET FOR THAT AND IT'S WHAT MAKES THIS. AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND DO THE DEPREDATION THAT WE KNOW. DOES NEED TO GET DONE RIGHT AND RIGHT NOW AS AS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER BIGELOW POINTED OUT IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT ON A FEDERAL TRAPPERS SOMEBODY TO COME. IT COULD BE. TOO LATE FRIDAY IN THE CASE OF YOUR LIVE STOCK THE YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT WELL THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO PREVENT THE SAME PERSON TO ADD MAKE MONEY BEING A PEST CONTROL. TRAPPER IN YOUR AREA THEY COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT LICENSE SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT NECESSARILY MAYBE CREATES A NEW MARKET FOR FOR NEW JOBS -- THAT ARE IN LINE AND AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THINGS LIKE INCIDENTAL TAKEN YOU KNOW. BASICALLY -- FOR TRAPPING FOR RECREATION XIN FOR PROTECTION OF PUBLIC -- INFRASTRUCTURE SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE HAVE THE NUTRIA RAT THAT IS THE NEW TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THAT A LOT RIGHT. IT'S AN INVASIVE SPECIES RIGHT SO WOULD WE BE ABLE TO TRAP AND I MEAN AND ULTIMATELY IN MANY CASES KILL THAT ANIMAL I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S PART WHILE LIKE MANAGEMENT THAT'S NOT PREVENTED IN THIS BILL OKAY. YOU CAN'T THEN GO SELL THE FOR OF THE NUTRIA I DON'T THINK THERE'S A MARKET FOR IT ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW. THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS PREVENTS BUT I MEAN MAYBE THERE'S MARKET SOMEWHERE THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED RECREATION. THAT'S NOT RECREATIONAL THAT'S WILDLIFE PROTECTION PROPERTY PROTECTION ALL THESE THINGS HAVE HAVE DIFFERENTTRAPPING LICENSES WELL MAYBE I'LL GO TO MISTER HENLEY DISSENTS HE'S IN THE SPACE OF PROTECTING WHAT LATEST WOULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT. WELL JUST TO CLARIFY WE ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE AGRICULTURE OR PRIVATE PROPERTY. EXEMPTION IN ALL CASES -- AND THEN WHEN WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH PREDATORS OF WILDLIFE YOU KNOW THAT IS A WHOLE SEPARATE ISSUE. BY YOU THEN TAKING TOOLS THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING THESE LOCAL TRAPPERS TO TRAP. EITHER FOR THE FOR OR RECREATIONALLY TAKE THAT TO AWAY FROM US THEN IT'S GONNA BE HARDER FOR US THAN. TO ACCOMPLISH OUR WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT GOALS AND SO THAT'S THE ISSUE FOR US SURE I I THINK YOU NEED TO ADDRESS TO THE COMMITTEE NOT ME BUT BUT IN IN. THAT THAT OFFER IS AN OUTLINE IT SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL. PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING WE CAN HAVE A SEPARATE AND FULLER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE WHAT THE COST BECOMES AND THEN IT'S REALLY JUST A TRANSFER COSTS IN AND NOT SOMETHING I THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE DISCUSSION AS AS TERM VICE CHAIR PREPARATIONS WE CAN HAVE IT. IS WHERE'S THE COST BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THESE THESE PERMITS AND SO. AT I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL DOES NOT OUTLAW. AT THAT THAT TAKING THAT TRAPPING OF OF INVASIVE SPECIES WHAT ABOUT THE PUBLIC HAVE BENEFITS OF THE TRACK HAVE ABOUT THAT NEED VICE CHAIR. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ALL THIS I I'LL TO SOMEONE I MEAN I I THINK WITH THIS HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT THERE ARE STILL ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SAYING HEY LOOK WE BEEN OBVIOUSLY MYSELF THE MEASURE BIGELOW I THINK IT WORK ON COMING FROM A RURAL AREA UNDERSTANDING THE AGRICULTURAL. IMPACTS AND YOU KNOW FOR THE WILD AND HABITAT THAT IS IN A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS -- WOULD APPRECIATE WORKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES I THINK ARE A ARE POTENTIAL CONFLICT AND MAKING HARDER. SOMETIMES DOES MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE RAY AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CARRY OUT WHAT OUR ROUTINE. PROTECTION YOU KNOW PART OF THE ROUTINE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ON MANY. FARMS AND RANCHES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC SO THAT'S JUST THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM AND I CAN'T SUPPORT IT RIGHT YET TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE. TO CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION WE DO HAVE A MOTION THREE MEN OF SECOND BY MISS GLORIA. DR. I THANK THE CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION NOT OUR CUP REMEMBERS SO ADDRESSED THE ISSUES IN THE A RURAL AREA I COME FROM URBAN AREA SELECT A CITY SELF -- BY WE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE INVASION OF WHAT COYOTES SO INTO RESIDENTIAL AREAS AND YOU CANNOT USE OUR RIFLES TO WHATEVER TO CONTROL THEM AND COMMON TOOL IS SO TRAPPING. AND THE FULL RELOCATION PURPOSES CELL AND IN THOSE CASES SO HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH A WHAT DO YOU MAKE AN EXEMPTION. THAT THE EXEMPTION EXIST THIS ISN'T BANNING THAT THIS ONLY BANS THE THE TRAPPING FOR THE SALE OF FOR OR RECREATION THAT DOESN'T FALL INTO THAT PERMIT. YOU JUST SPECIFIED IT IT'S TO REMOVE A COYOTE FROM AN URBAN AREA THAT'S NOT CHANGED BY THIS BILL. I WANT TO REPEAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES AWAY THE THE LICENSE BY WHICH PEOPLE USE THAT TO SELL FOR OR TO TRAP FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES WHICH I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS BUT BUT IT'S IT'S THE SAILOR FOR IT DOESN'T STOP. ANY OF THE PROVISIONS BY WHICH WERE PROTECTING PERSONAL PROPERTY OR LIVES AGRICULTURE -- ENVY I'VE AGAINST INVASIVE SPECIES A WHOLE HOST OF VALID REASONS WHY WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TRAP ANIMALS IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THAT CLEAR TO ME -- THANKS. FOR NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND SELECT CLOSE. RECESS ASSN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. SEARCH I POSSIBLE ROLE. MOTION IS TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. EDUARDO GARCIA GARCIA AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO. BIGELOW. BIGELOW NOT VOTING CHOI NO CHOI NO. CHIU [inaudible] DALY. DALY NO. FRIEDMAN. HI FRIEDMAN I CRISTINA GARCIA. GARCIA I GLORIA. GLORIA I KALRA. LEVINE. LEVINE I BLANCA RUBIO. RUBIO AYE SALAS. WOULD. WOULD I IT WILL BE A CALL OPEN ON THAT ITEM THANK YOU. THE P.. FORTY FOUR SO REMEMBER FRIEDMAN MORNING. MORNING BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION WITH THE TWO SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE TO PROPOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO THE TOP OF PAGE. FIVE WITH REGARDS TO A MOMENT NUMBER ONE I WE DO BUILD SOME CONCERN FOR THE LANGUAGE BUT LIKE TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON TIGHTENING THE LANGUAGE I TO NARROW THE EXEMPTIONS THAT IT'S LIMITED PERHAPS TO SKINS TAKEN WITH THE BALLOT CALIFORNIA HUNTING LICENSE. BOOK LIKE THAT THAT OPTION. I AB FORTY FOUR WOULD MAKE IT UNLAWFUL TO GIVE SELLER MANUFACTURE A NEW FOR PRODUCT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF PASSED CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY TO BAN THE CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY FOR TRADE WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES. FOR IS NOT A BY PRODUCT OF THE MEAT INDUSTRY AND I REPEAT THE FOR THAT IS PURCHASED IN A FURRIER IS NOT THE BY PRODUCT OF THE MEAT INDUSTRY IT COMES FROM ANIMALS THAT ARE FACTORY FARMED OR TRAPPED PURELY FOR FASHION. FOR FARMING AND THE FOR TRADE ARE LARGELY SELF REGULATED. IN THE US I WAS VERY SURPRISED LOS PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR ANIMALS HELD ON THESE FARMS AND FOR URBAN AND ANIMALS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO HUMANE SLAUGHTER RULES THE WAY THAT ANIMALS -- SLAUGHTERED FOR FOR FOR FOOD ARE. TODAY THERE ARE A VARIETY OF HUMANE AND VERY CHIC ALTERNATIVES IN TERMS OF PH R THAT'S RITUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM REAL. FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TEXTILES THAT ARE JUST AS WARM AND JUSTICE FASHIONABLE. COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD OR FUELING INNOVATION AND NEW AND SUSTAINABLE FABRICS AND A LOT OF OUR MAJOR FASHION MANUFACTURERS HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN THE MESSAGE ABOUT CRUELTY FREE PRODUCTS AND THE DESIRABILITY OF THEM. RETAILERS SUCH AS GUCCI MICHAEL KORS JIMMY CHOO ARMANI BURBERRY AND SHOULD NOW HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO GO FOR FREE. SEVERAL CITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES WEST -- WEST HOLLYWOOD TO SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKLEY HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A STAND BY PASSING ORDINANCES MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO SELL TRADE OR MANUFACTURE FOR WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES. AND TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT AFFECT LEATHER SHEEP FOR AND CAL FOR ANIMALS THAT ARE HARVESTED FOR THEIR FOR FOOD AND WE WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT MIGHT PHILOSOPHY IS THAT IF YOU ARE TAKING ANIMAL FOR FOOD YOU SHOULD USE EVERY BIT OF THAT ANIMAL. SO WE WERE VERY CLEAR TWO EXAMS -- THOSE ANIMALS WE ARE NOT -- CONTROLLING LEATHER AND SHEARLING. AB FORTY FOUR SUPPORTED BY HUGO BY STELLA MCCARTNEY SUSIE AND JACK WELCH MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI FROM LOS ANGELES AND OVER SIXTY OTHER DESIGNERS RETAILERS IN ORGANIZATIONS. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB FORTY FOUR IS PJ SMITH WITH THE HUMANE SOCIETY MARCHING FOUNDER OF ANIMAL HOPING LEGISLATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. HELLO THANK YOU. MY NAME IS PJ SMITH AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FASHION POLICY FOR THE HUMANE SOCIETY THE UNITED STATES A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF AB. FORTY FOUR ON BEHALF OF THE HUMANE SOCIETY KNIGHTED STATES AND OUR MANY SUPPORTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE THINK WE LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN A FRIEDMAN FRAZIER DO SEEN AS HISTORIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHICH IF PASSED WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE TO BAN THE CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY FOR TRADE. FOR THE PAST DECADE I WORK WITH DOZENS OF THE TOP OF PERIL COMPANIES TO CREATE POLICIES THEY'RE GOOD FOR ANIMALS AND THE ENVIRONMENT. FROM LUXURY BRANDS LIKE GUCCI CHANEL BERBERIAN MICHAEL CORES TO RETAILERS LIKE TJ MAX AND BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY. WHEN THESE COMPANIES DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND ACTUALLY EXAMINE THE FUR TRADE CLOSELY EVERY MARKETING SCHEME EVERY VEGA CLAIM AND EVERY CERTIFICATION PROGRAM THEY QUICKLY REALIZE THERE'S NO WAY TO HUMANELY SOURCE? FOR SADLY THE FUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO TRY TO GREEN LOST ITS TRADE WITH DIFFERENT INDUSTRY FUNDED MARKETING SCHEMES. BUT THANKFULLY TOP FASHION BRANDS EVEN THE ONES THAT SOLD FOR OUR SEEN RIGHT THROUGH THE SCHEMES AND ARE CHOOSING TO GO FOR FREE SINCE THEY FAIL TO ADDRESS. THIS SERIOUS ANIMAL WELFARE PROBLEMS INHERENT WITH CONFINING AND ON DOMESTICATED ANIMAL AND A SMALL PARING CAGE FOR ITS ENTIRE LIFE. DEATH BY ANAL ANAL ELECTROCUTION OR GASSING IS STANDARD ON FOR FACTORY FARMS. AS WELL ANIMALS INCLUDING THREATENED SPECIES AND EVEN OUR PETS ARE CALL IN AN INDISCRIMINATE LEG HOLD TRAPS FOR DAYS WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER IT'S ACCEPTED NORM. NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTIFIED FARMS ARE STILL RAMPANT WITH SELF MUTILATION. INJURIES BECAUSE OF A LACK OF THAT CARE IN FOX'S THAT ARE BRED TO HAVE SO MUCH SKIN THEY ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO MOVE PROPERLY. TODAY CONSUMERS CARE ABOUT ANIMAL WELFARE ANY IN INNOVATION MORE THAN EVER AND FASHION BRANDS ARE RESPONDING TO THIS GROWING MARKET BY ANNOUNCING FOR FREE POLICIES. WHEN ONLINE LUXURY RETAILER NOW TO PORT DAY FIRST CONCERT FIRST CONSIDER GOING FOR FREE IT SURVEYED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OF ITS CUSTOMERS INCLUDING THOSE THAT SPEND OVER MILLION DOLLARS ON ITS SITE EVERY YEAR? AND THEY OVERWHELMINGLY ASKED THE COMPANY TO GO FOR FREE. NOW FASHION COMPANIES LEFT AND RIGHT ARE REJECTING THE FOR INDUSTRIES DISINGENUOUS ATTEMPTS TO MARKET FOR AS HUMANE. AND REALIZE THE COMPUTER COMPANY OUR CONSUMERS WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANIMAL CRUELTY IN THEIR CLOTHING CHOICES. THIS IS LED TO AN ONSLAUGHT OF JUST IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CHANEL BURBERRY VERSACE DINESEN FURSTENBERG DONNA KAREN COACH INSTYLE MAGAZINE. FARFETCH TJ MAX IN COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR AND NOW IT'S FOR FREE POLICIES. THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT WAS GUCCI MICHAEL COURTS YOU CANNOT AFFORD TODAY JIMMY CHOO BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY IN THE NORTH FACE AND BEFORE THAT WAS OUR MONEY RALPH AROUND TOMMY HILFIGER. CALVIN KLEIN HUGO BOSS STELLA MCCARTNEY AND DOZENS OF OTHERS. THIS MASS EXODUS ONLY SPEEDING UP AS MORE COMPANIES PLEDGE NO LONGER SELL FOR MORE COUNTRIES LIKE UNITED KINGDOM NORWAY AND THE NETHERLANDS BAND FOR PRODUCTION. AND MORE CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO BAND FOR SALES THIS IS BRINGING INNOVATIVE AND SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES TO TAKE ITS PLACE. RIGHT NOW FASHION BRANDS ARE WORKING WITH FLOW PHÃ¹FOR COMPANIES TO CREATE BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS THAT THE SAME LOOK AND FEEL IS FOR BUT WITHOUT THE CRUELTY MASK IF YOU GET SUMMARIZED AS A STILL AS A STATE THAT'S NOTE FOR INNOVATION CALIFORNIA THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY. CAPITALIZE ON THIS GROWING MARKET AS WELL AS IT SOLIDIFY ITS POSITION AS THE MOST HUMANE STATE IN THE NATION THANK YOU THANK YOUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. HE TOOK MOST OF YOUR TIME OFF SHORE. NO THAT'S OKAY HI MY NAME IS MARK FROM ANIMAL OPEN LEGISLACIÃ³N I'M ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ON I LIKE TO THANK LAURA FOR BEING SUCH A AMAZING SPONSOR AND SOCIAL DESCENT. CALIFORNIA BEING THE MOST HUMANE STATE. FOR IN THE CRUEL WAY ANIMALS ARE IN HUMANE EXPLOITED FOR THEIR SKIN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. THOSE IN OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOR INDUSTRY CLAIM THAT FOR IS HUMANE. AND THAT MUCH OF WHAT IS SEEN IN REGARDS TO THE VIDEOS THAT ARE SHARED ON SOCIAL MEDIA ARE FAKE ARE OUTDATED. PART OF WHAT. OUR HISTORY HAS BEEN IN OUR GROUP IS THAT WE'VE GONE INTO FOR FARMS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES CANADA FINLAND AND CHINA. EARLIER TODAY I HEARD A STORY OF A LAMB. AND ITS SUFFERING AND HOW HARD IT WAS TO SEE THAT AND HOW SAD AND HOW. GUT WRENCHING. I HAVE WALKED THOSE SAME TYPE OF THINGS IN FOR FARMS WHERE. THERE THE SMALL CAGES THAT THEIR BREAD AND AND NEVER TOUCH GROUND EVER. AND NOT JUST THAT THEY ARE. STUNDEN ELECTROCUTED IN MAINE. BUT THE WORST PART OF IT IS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT TRYING. TO MANY OF THESE FOXES ARE STILL ALIVE AT THE END. HANGING FROM THESE FOLKS WERE THEY RIP THEIR SKIN OFF AND YOU CAN HEAR THEM SCREAMING. THERE IS NO WAY TO REGULATE THAT. REGULATION OF THE FOR INDUSTRY AND CALIFORNIA BEING THE HUMANE STATED IS. IT IS 1100% IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT CRUELTY IT'S ABOUT ETHICS AND IT'S ABOUT PUTTING COMPASSION FIRST. ASK CALIFORNIANS. BEING IN AN ENVIRONMENT. WHERE YOU GET TO WITNESS THESE THINGS? THERE IS NO SUFFERING GREATER THAN THAT. OF SOMETHING OR SOMEONE THAT YOU CANNOT HELP WHERE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT. I ASK THAT YOU IMAGINE YOUR OWN CHILDREN. OR SOMEONE YOU LOVE BUT YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR FAMILY. IMAGINE BEING ENSLAVED AND BEING THAT REYES AND WATCHING EVERY DAY THAT SUFFERING. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL STANDS AGAINST AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE. FOR ETHICS A PASSION MORALITY AND THERE IS NO. NO WAY TO REGULATE AN INDUSTRY LIKE THAT AND WE ASK YOU FOR YOUR YES VOTES IN SUPPORT OF AB. FORTY FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL OPEN IT UP FOR OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MASK -- THOSE WERE GOING TO BE THAT'S FINE OPPOSITION A BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD IF THERE'S ANYONE. MOVE THOSE OTHERS MOTION. MOTION BY MISTER KALRA SECOND BY MISTER GLORIA. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEITH KAPLAN I'M A RESIDENT WEST HOLLYWOOD FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I AM WITH THE FOR INFORMATION COUNTS OF AMERICA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. WHERE WHERE THE HSUS STUDIES THAT YOU'VE SEEN THEIR AN ACCURATE THEIR OUTDATED A DECADE OLD? AND IF YOU SAW WOMEN'S WEAR DAILY LAST WEEK THEY'VE EXPOSING A BEST A GEISHA BUT THIS GETTING A LIVE VIDEO WAS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR A SNUFF FILM TO CREATE A NARRATIVE. ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUPS HAVE NOT PRESENTED YOU WITH THE FAX WE WELCOME THE CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. WE SHARE YOUR CONCERN FOR ANIMAL WELFARE AND WE WORKED VIGOROUSLY TOWARDS IMPROVING ANIMAL WELFARE PRACTICES BASED ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. GIVE US A CHANCE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. AB FORTY FOUR HAS PRESENTED A GOOD STARTING POINT FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT MEANINGFUL PROGRAMS. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ON A GLOBAL SCALE BUT A BAND IS NOT THE ANSWER. AND WE HÃ¹THE BAND PROMPTED RETAILS AND CUSTOMERS TO GO TO BEVERLY HILLS. IN SAN FRANCISCO RETAILERS ARE PLANNING OUTPOSTS IN PALO ALTO. A BAND WILL SIMPLY SEND CONSUMERS OUT OF QUE JUST. FOR CALIFORNIA LOSES JOBS CALIFORNIA LOSES TAX REVENUES AND IN THE END THE BAN ITSELF HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON ANIMAL WELFARE. BUT WHAT A BAND WILL DO IS TAKE AWAY CONSUMERS RIGHT TO CHOOSE YOU WILL TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHT TO PURCHASE A NATURAL RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT LIKE NATURAL. FOR LEAVING THEM ONLY SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT VIOLATE THE VERY CORE VALUES OF SUSTAINABILITY. PRODUCTS LIKE FAKE FURTHER PETROLEUM BASED NON BIODEGRADABLE AND IMPOSE AN ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT SO REAL THAT EVEN HERE IN YOUR OWN ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM HAS RECOGNIZED THIS THREAT WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A MICROFIBER BELL. SO LET'S ALL PAUSE TAKE THE TIME TO EDUCATE OURSELVES AND TALK TO EACH OTHER AND WORKING TOGETHER LET'S MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS TO MEET THE OBJECTIVES OF IMPROVING ANIMAL WELFARE IN IS IMPACTFUL AND BROUGHT AWAY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU. MY NAME IS NANCY DANIEL IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL FOR FEDERATION FOR THE AMERICAS REGION. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THANK MISS FRIEDMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DIALOGUE AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB FORTY FOUR WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON ALTERNATIVE. AND OUR ALTERNATIVE WILL HAVE REAL AND MEANINGFUL IMPACTS ON GLOBAL ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS. THE ALTERNATIVE IS CALLED FOR MARK A BRAND NEW GLOBAL PROGRAM THAT WILL ENSURE HIGH ANIMAL WELFARE STANDARDS AND TRACEABILITY IN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY STRINGENT REGULATIONS THAT ARE IN EFFECT AT THE STATE LEVEL. FOR MARK IS ABOUT AUDITS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT ANIMAL WELFARE AUDITS AT THE FARM LEVEL IN THE US CANADA AND EUROPE. THESE AUDITS ARE NEW AND ARE BEING DONE TO ENSURE FARMS ARE FOLLOWING ALL FOR FARMING STANDARDS IN ADDITION TO THE ALREADY STRINGENT RIGHT REGULATIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE AUDITS WILL WEED OUT ANYONE NOT ADHERING TO THE STANDARDS FOR MARK IS ABOUT ADDITIONAL RANDOM AUDITS OF THE DRESSING AND DIE IN LEVEL TO ENSURE A CHEMICAL COMPLIANCE. AND FINALLY FOR MARK IS ABOUT TRACEABILITY A BRAND NEW BLOCKCHAIN CLOUD BASED SYSTEM THAT WILL TRACE ALL PELTS FROM THE FARM LEVEL THROUGH TO THE MANUFACTURING STAGE. ALL THIS WILL MEAN ACCOUNTABILITY THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION AND ULTIMATELY CONFIDENCE IN THE SYSTEM. SHOULD CALIFORNIA ADOPT THIS NEW SYSTEM AT THE FOREFRONT OF CERTIFICATION FOR FOR AND FORCE OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD TO FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD. FOR MARK WILL ALSO SERVE TO EDUCATE THE CONSUMER AND OTHERS ABOUT FOR FARMING FAX FAX LIKE FOR FOR ME CREATES A LOT MORE PRODUCTS THAN JUST. FOR PRODUCTS LIKE MINK OIL WHICH IS USED AS A LEATHER CONDITIONER. THE MEAT IS USED AS A PREFERRED LOWER IN THE CRAB FISHING INDUSTRY. AND THE MEAT SOMETIMES IS RENDERED DOWN AND USED AS A BIO FUEL AND FINALLY IT IS USED IN THE PET FOOD INDUSTRY. WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU AND CREATE A CONVERSATION ON FOR MARK. AS THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE TO AN OUTRIGHT BRAND BAND THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M GONNA SEE IF FOR OTHERS WHO WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MATT GRAY ON BEHALF OF TAXPAYERS FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE WELL INTENDED THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF AB. FORTY FOUR IS THE RELIANCE UPON AND WHAT A LOT OF ADVOCATES CALL FOR SYNTHETIC MATERIALS WHICH A PETROLEUM BASED. WALL STREET JOURNAL TWO DAYS AGO CAME OUT WITH AN ARTICLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MICROFIBER IS IN OUR QUARTIC SYSTEMS AND POISONING OUR FISH CAUSING LIVER FAILURE. PREMATURE DEATH AND ENDING UP IN OUR FOODS THAT WE EAT AND FOUND IN OUR TISSUE AND FAECAL MATTER. SO IT'S ENDING UP IN A SHRIMP IT'S ENDING UP IN PLANKTON SENDING UP ALL OVER THE PLACE. PLANKTON PROVIDES HALF OF OUR WORLD'S OXYGEN SO WE ASK FOR YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MICHAEL LELAND FOR COMMISSION USA WE OPPOSE. SEVERAL FONG I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUSINESS FEDERATION ALSO KNOWN AS BIZ FAD WHERE AN ALLIANCE OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS THAT REPRESENT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYERS. WITH THREE AND A HALF MILLION EMPLOYEES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF MISREPRESENTATION AROUND THE FOR INDUSTRY AND WE ARE OPPOSED AB FORTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN THAT WE ARE TO HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. GLORIA MISTREATMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS BILL I THINK WE ALL -- OR I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE SUPPORT THE I SUPPORT THE GOAL THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SEEK GIVEN A NUMBER OF CARVE OUTS IF YOU WILL ABOUT USE OF THE WHOLE ANIMAL THERE. ARE FARMS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT DO REYES RABBIT MEAT THAT DO USE THE PULSE AND SO I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU TO INCORPORATE AMENDMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR THAT USE I THINK CARVE OUTS DON'T ALLOW FOR THAT. BUT THEY ALLOW FOR THE USE OF THE ENTIRE ANIMAL FOR OTHER PURPOSES CAN YOU DO THAT. I'M YEAH WOULD YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP AS A CONCERN AND MISTER SALAS IT ALSO BROUGHT UP GOATS AND WHICH IN HIS COMMUNITY. I'M ARE EATEN AND YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE BE ABLE TO USE THOSE BELTS AND OUR INTENTION IS NOT. TO HAVE ANYBODY THROW AWAY OF HEALTH AFTER ANIMALS BEATEN SO WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AN AMENDMENT -- TO SEE IF WE CAN BRING. BRING THEM INTO COMPLIANCE IN A WAY WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE AGAIN -- THE ANIMALS THAT WE ARE TARGETING ARE ONES THAT ARE REYES SOLELY FOR THEIR FOR AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE EATING RABBITS ARE EATING GOATS ARE EATING POWER SHEEP THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT AND JUST. TO RESPOND TO ONE THING THAT WAS SAID WAS ABOUT POLLUTION THERE ARE PLENTY OF ALTERNATIVES UNDER OUR BILL SHEEP AND COW -- A CODE -- SO IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SYNTHETICS YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THEM YOU CAN STILL HAVE A NICE WARM COAT I THINK -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THE MISTREATMENT OF FOR THIS LEGISLATION JUST WANTED -- TO BOOKLET BE CLEAR AT ALL WITH A MINUTE NUMBER -- TWO SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF DID YOU ACCEPT. THAT AMENDMENT WE ACCEPTED IT AND YES WE ACCEPT IT THANK YOU AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ONE PERTAINING TO NATIVE AMERICANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M I WANT TO THANK YOU OF MISTREATMENT FOR OFFERING THIS LEGISLATION I THINK THE CHAIRMAN AND HIS STAFF. OF FOR THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS PROVIDED I RECOGNIZE THIS ISSUE CAN. IN GENDER OUGHT OF EMOTION -- BUT I FOR ME THIS IS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF DOING RIGHT OR WRONG -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES -- THAT WORK A DIMENSION OF OPPORTUNITY OF REGIME -- TO WORK WITH THIS IS NOT WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS TO DO WE WANT TO TRULY LEAD -- AND BY LEADING THAT IS BY BANNING THIS BUT THE HUMANE -- AND NOT AND NOT WITH A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SOCIETY -- SO I PLEDGE YOU IN YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND I'M HAPPY TO SECOND THE MOTION TO BIGELOW [inaudible] THANK. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR GOAL HERE TO TRY TO BE HUMANE AND ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE RAISED HERE -- THERE ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES AND SOME INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT ARE. CHANGING AND I THINK WE HEARD THEM. ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK WITH SOME OF THOSE -- IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED HERE LISTEN TO ON AND AND SEE HOW THEY CAN BE INCORPORATED. THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU. I DON'T COMPOUND QUESTION HERE ALL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK THAT THAT'S AN ADMIRABLE CERTAINLY BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS IN PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOR OPERATIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SOAR FAT SOURCE ANY PRODUCT. AND TO SAY THAT IF WE SET THE STANDARD THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERY SINGLE FOR THAT SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE HUMANELY SOURCED -- YOU COULD NEVER SAY THAT WITH THE AMOUNT OF GARMENTS THAT COME INTO THE STATE SO THERE BE REALLY NO WAY FOR RETAILERS TO KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SOURCES IT IS WE'VE HEARD REPORTS OF RETAILERS -- A YOU KNOW OFTEN OF REACH EVEN MAJOR REACH IN THE MORE OTHER PRODUCTS SO THIS THE REALLY THE IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE COMPASSION YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AROUND THE WORLD THERE ARE SO MANY IN HUMANE PRACTICES AND YOU REALLY SOME OF THE ONES THAT WERE CITED HERE. ARE PROBABLY SOME OF THE BEST DOCTORS BUT YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF COUNTRIES WHERE THERE'S NO STANDARDS AT ALL FOR HOW ANIMALS ARE RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED IN A LOT OF THOSE END UP IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET. SO THAT WOULD BE MY RESPONSE TO THAT SO GIVEN THAT SAID THAT OPENS THE DOOR SINCE WE CAN'T REGULATE THE WORLD WE CAN'T REGULATE OUTSIDE OUR OWN BOUNDARIES. BUT WE CAN REGULATE WITH DAN SO LOOKING AT THE LOGIC THAT MAYBE IF WE CAN WORK WITHIN OUR OWN STATE BOUNDARIES WHERE WE CAN -- HANDLE THOSE TYPE OF REGULATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD HERE ARE HUMANELY TREATED WITH THOSE TYPE OF REGULATIONS SO THAT WE DO HAVE A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM. WHEN WE DO HAVE A PRODUCT HERE IN CALIFORNIA? SO MAYBE YOU CAN WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT DEALING WITH THAT SECOND QUESTION. GOING TO MR LEVIN'S POINT. HI GOING BACK TO THE FOUR H. AND FFA DAYS -- THERE ARE A LOT OF FOLKS OUT HERE IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE RABBIT FORM SIR PEOPLE HAVE TO GO FARMS BOTH. LARGE CODES AT ME CODES. AND FOR THE FOR AN AS AS WELL AS THE PICNIC TYPE CODES. YOU'RE NOT WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOR ALL OF THEM ARE EDIBLE PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING CONSUMED. I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A MINUTE AND TRY TO ADJUST FOR THAT. ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LICENSES CELLS TAGS FOR DEER AND BEAR IN CERTAIN -- ANIMALS EVEN WHILE TAKES. WELL IT'S BEEN MY PASSION OF AN ISSUE -- THOUGH THAT THOSE ANIMALS. WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO USE THOSE HEIGHTS. AS PART OF THE TAKES A DOES YOUR BILL. OR WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED WILLING TO TAKE A MINUTE TO CLARIFY. AND ANIMALS THAT ARE TAKEN UNDER THE STATE LICENSED -- TAG PER TAKE UNIT YEAH THAT'S THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT THE COMMITTEE GAVE US SO SO THAT THAT IS INCLUDED MAKE IT I MISSED THAT SPECIFIC TYPE LANGUAGE. DEALING WITH LICENSE TIME TO THAT WAS THE FIRST AMENDMENT FROM THE COMMITTEE OKAY WELL AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A A HUNTING LICENCES LONG AS IT WAS TAKEN WITH OKAY WHICH IS A REAL CALIFORNIA HUNTING LICENCES THINK THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION ON WHETHER THAT. YEAH THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE INTENT OF THE AMENDMENT AND IT'S OUR INTENT AS WELL OKAY SO. THAT IS THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AS STATED YES MY INTENT IS THAT IF YOU TAKE THE ANIMAL WITH A VALID HUNTING LICENSE OR IF IT'S AN ANIMAL THAT IS BEING. YOU KNOW TAKEN FOR FOR ME WITH IN CALIFORNIA -- THE AND WE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T THINK ABOUT GROWTH SO I WAS GLAD THAT IT WAS BROUGHT UP BY MR SALAS AND WE DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RABBIT IN. WITH THE REASON THAT THE THAT WE DIDN'T ALLOW ALL RABBIT IS BECAUSE THERE IS RABBIT THAT IS REYES JUST FOR FOR AND YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF PLACES BUT FOR THE ANIMALS THAT ARE RAISED. FOR ME I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD USE THOSE PELTS I MEAN ALL THE FLOAT PHILOSOPHICALLY I BELIEVE IN USE ALL THAT AND SO WILL WORK ON LANGUAGE. TO YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT AS LONG AS WE REALLY KNOW THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE REYES FOR YOU KNOW THAT'S MY INTENT TO FIND THE LANGUAGE TO DO THAT BUT GO WE CAN YOU KNOW I I WE HAVE TALKED I JUST SPOKE TO THE MAIN DECIDED IN. OF A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT NOW I WANT TO I THINK IT SHOULD BE FINE. FOR ONCE FOR ONCE ONCE WORLD SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THERE THERE'S THE SHEEP WITH YES WILL AND THEN THERE'S THE THE FOR TYPE YES YES THAT'S ALREADY IN THE BILL SHEARLING IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AS BEING ACCEPTABLE. AND CAL FOR AN AND CAL SKIN WITH FOR WE NEED TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR WE CAN WORK OUT AND WE WILL DO THAT THAT TO I THANK YOU THINK YOU'RE ON AFTER THE CLARIFICATION RIGHT WE HAVE A QUESTION FOR MISTER KALRA. FAULTLESS DOLLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SUMMER FRIEDMAN -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK -- WERE HAVING SOME OF AN EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS -- OF HOW OUR ACTIONS. HAVE IMPACTS OF WEATHER STOCK MY GLOBAL WARMING WHAT HAVE YOU OR IN THIS CASE OUR ACTIONS OF IMPACTS ON WILDLIFE ON ANIMALS YOUR BILL IS AS WELL AS A MEMBER. GONZALEZ IS BILL EARLIER ARE PART OF THAT MOVEMENT -- OF CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THAT WE'RE REALIZING THAT. WE HAVE CHOICES AND OUR CHOICES HAVE AN IMPACT. AND YOU KNOW BUT THERE'S PROHIBITS FASHION VERSES FOR OR FIRST PERSONAL PREFERENCE VERSUS THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE CHOICES. THAT PEOPLE MAKE BUT I THINK THE THE STATE DOES HAVE A ROLE -- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS NECESSARY. FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OURSELVES OUR FAMILIES -- AND IF IT'S JUST A KIND OF AND I I LIKE THAT THERE'S A HASHTAG THAT WAS ALREADY MADE. MAKE COMPASSION THE FASHION SOMEONE SAID SOME OF THE VERY THAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED. BUT REALLY JUST FASHION I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN THE FASHION TRENDS MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. AND I THINK THAT THE THE THE TIMING IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS AND I THINK IT WILL HELP TO LEAD THE REST OF THE NATION AND I CERTAINLY APPLAUD THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE STATE. OF UPPERS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD IF THE INDUSTRY IS GOING TO DO THINGS -- TO IMPROVE THEIR PRACTICES THAT'S THAT'S TO BE APPLAUDED AND WE GOT THEM. IN OF OTHER CERTAINLY DISCOURAGE THAT BUT I THINK. THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE IT'S IT'S PRETTY BLACK AND WHITE AS TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I THINK THIS IS A TIME FOR US. TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT FOR IS NOT NECESSARY AND THAT WE DON'T NEED TO HARM ANIMALS IN ORDER TO EITHER. CLOSE OURSELVES INTO AUTO. STYLER CELLS AND I I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT STEP TODAY -- BUT AND I REALLY WANT TO PUSH IT THE CHAIR AND THIS PARTICULAR BILL AS WELL AS THE SUMMIT IS ALSO IS A BILL I THINK OUTLINING. WHERE WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND AND WHERE WE NEED TO TO GO IN THE FUTURE SO AGAIN THANK YOU A SIMILAR FRIEDMAN THANK YOU? THANK YOU. FOR SHEET YOU -- HAVE THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE RABBITS AND THE GO HIDES I WANTED -- PERSONAL I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGIES OBVIOUSLY CHANGED I DON'T HAVE ANY FOR THAT I'M AWARE OF ANYWHERE IN MY HOUSE I USED. THE GREAT THINGS A CAPELLAS MAKES TO KEEP THE RAIN OFF I MEAN CONFORMANCE SO. ONCE YOU'RE THAT WITH YOU ALSO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH I DID LOOK AT YOUR MEMBERS I WAS -- THAT DOES AMENDMENTS AND I THE ONE MINUTE DEFERRED NATIVE AMERICANS I HAVE -- NATIVE AMERICANS ALL OVER MY DISTRICT THAT AREN'T RECOGNIZED EITHER FEDERALLY OR BY CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW YOUR YOUR AMENDMENT DID STATE THAT IT WAS BY TRIBES THAT WERE RECOGNIZED. AND SO THERE ARE NOT A NATIVE AMERICANS RECOGNIZE BUT THEY ARE NATIVE AMERICANS WHO STILL PRACTICE -- THEIR TRADITIONS -- WITH -- SO I WAS WONDERING IF THERE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW EVEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT HOW WE DRESS THAT EVEN BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RECOGNIZE BUT THEY ARE NATIVE AMERICANS SO I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION. SOMETHING I KNOW I'M GONNA HEAR FROM FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN POP POPULATION IN MY DISTRICT AND THERE ARE MANY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF AN ACTUALLY THAT AREN'T RECOGNIZED BY CALIFORNIA OR A FEDERALLY -- I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT AND WE DO ALSO HAVE A RELIGIOUS YOU KNOW NEVER RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION SO WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK WITH YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AND WILL WILL ENGAGE IN THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL WHICH WAS OF IMPORTANT. PIECE TO THE AMENDMENT FOR US AS WELL. OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LISTEN ON UP MEISTER. YES SIR I HAVE BEEN BOUNCE AROUND TO SEVERAL COMMITTEES THIS MORNING -- MAY WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT COMMITTEE SCHEDULING -- BUT YOU KNOW. AND WE KIND OF GOT IN THIS IN THEAND IN THE PREVIOUS BILL -- LOOK I JUST THINK THE BETTER WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IN A DEMOCRACY AND IN A FREE MARKET ECONOMY IS THAT CONSUMERS YOU KNOW CAN DEMAND THAT PRACTICES CHANGE BY THE BY THE WAY THEY ACT. AND BY THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY DECIDE TO PURCHASE OR NOT PURCHASE. AND IN THIS FEAR THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING YOU KNOW AS AS A MEMBER KALRA POINTED OUT. WHICH AGAIN BRINGS YOU BACK TO WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS BILL. I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY OUR ROLE TO DECIDE WHO NEEDS FOR AND WHO DOESN'T. AND TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF JUDGMENTS. JUST BECAUSE YOU PERHAPS THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A MORAL OBJECTION TO IT. DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY IN SOCIETY SHOULD. OR THAT WE SHOULD USE THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE THAT IMPOSE THAT ON EVERYBODY ELSE -- CAN ACT. IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY WITH THEIR FEET AND WITH THEIR PURCHASES. AND SO I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE HERE IS AND THE ARGUMENT THAT WE JUST WELL WE DON'T REALLY NEED FOR ANYMORE OR ON THE SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS AND THAT IN THIS CONTEXT CAN EASILY BE APPLIED. TO IT VERY EASILY THE SAME EXACT LINE OF ARGUMENT BEEF A LINE TO SAY HEY WE SHOULDN'T. RAISE CATTLE. FOR FOOD. YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE SHOULDN'T. YOU KNOW I MEAN EVERY EVERY YEAR I BUY A HARVESTER RICE CROP. I KILL A PLANT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THAT RICE THAT FEEDS PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IF WE'RE GONNA ARGUE THAT HEY YOU SHOULDN'T KILL LIVING THING. YOUR PLANTS ARE ARE ALSO LIVING NEAR DISS. SO I MEAN. THE WHOLE CAN GO TO A CRAZY CONCLUSION. ESSENTIALLY AND SO YOU KNOW IF IT'S NOT OKAY IN THIS CONTEXT AGAIN LET'S ALLOW THE FREE MARKET TO DECIDE WHAT PRODUCTS PEOPLE WANT AND WHAT WHAT MARKETS ARE ACTUALLY COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. AND NOT DO SO BY. OF THE AUDIENCE. PLEASE [inaudible] ALLOW THE MY CHAIR TO MAKE HIS COMMENTS AND YOU'VE ALL HAD YOUR TIMES BIG ALREADY THEY GIVE. RIGHT I MEAN IS THIS IS YOU KNOW. I THINK THIS IS A A LEGITIMATE PRACTICE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY MORAL OBJECTION TO THOSE WHO TRY WHO WHO FOR INSTANCE TRAP -- YOU KNOW THAT IS A FORM OF HUNTING -- IT IS A FORM THE AREA MAYBE IT'S NOT. WHERE YOU COME FROM YOU KNOW AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DO -- BUT IN MY DISTRICT YEAH PEOPLE DO TRAP YOU KNOW AND AND YEAH THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE YOU KNOW THE DESIRE TO HAVE FOR AND THE AND THE AND THE DESIRE. TO YOU KNOW ENGAGE IN THAT COMMERCIAL MARKET. AYE AYE AND I DON'T SEE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THAT SAME YOU CAN SAY THAT THAT IS IMMORAL AND WRONG AND MUST BE BANNED. AND YET STILL SAY AND WE ALREADY DO HAVE. SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON DC HAVE AN OBJECTION DECALS AND WANT TO MAKE THAT PART OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL. I'M SORRY. THAT IS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC FREE MARKET SOCIETY IT'S CONSISTENT WITH AN AUTHORITARIAN. ONE IS CONSISTENT WITH A SOCIALIST. ONE BUT IT'S NOT ONE THAT I WANT TO ADOPT. YOU KNOW HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND YOU KNOW THOSE WHO. WHO REALLY HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT IT MANY OF THEM IN THIS ROOM YOU'RE ALREADY ACTING? IN YOUR IN YOUR OWN DEMOCRATIC WAY OF DOING THAT WE DON'T NEED TO USE UTILIZE THE POWER OF GOVERNMENT. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR POINT AND YOU HAVE MADE YOUR POINT. EN EN OBVIOUSLY INDUSTRIES HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THIS PRECISELY BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN ACTING SO THE SYSTEM WORKS -- AND THIS IS WHY I'M JUST I'M NOT A FAN OF THESE BLANKET BANS. ON CERTAIN PRACTICES THAT REALLY ARE ABOUT YOUR OWN PERSONAL -- ELECTIONS YOU KNOW NOT ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AND IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT MAYBE PEOPLE VIEW THE WORLD LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. THEN YOU ND MAYBE PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED IN DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES MAYBE THEY GREW UP IN. AND RECREATION IT DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU DID YOU KNOW AND SO. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TO ME IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT AND IT. AND WE SHOULDN'T GO DOWN THIS ROAD -- BECAUSE TOMORROW MIGHT BE SOMETHING ELSE IT THAT YOU REALLY THIS PART OF YOUR LIVELIHOOD THIS PART OF YOU KNOW YOUR CULTURE PART OF YOUR YOU KNOW -- NOT BRINGING THAT SOMEONE DECIDES TO BAN AND YOU MIGHT BE OPPOSED TO THAT. BUT IF YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH THE SAME. YOU KNOW WITH THE SAME THING. AND WE CONTINUE TO MOVE DOWN THIS ROAD WHO'S GONNA BE THERE TO SPEAK FOR YOU. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE CASE SO WE HAVE WITH THAT I WOULD URGE INTO A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. WE HAVE -- ANOTHER COLLEAGUE ASKED QUESTION AND WE'LL LET YOU CLOSE A DOCTOR. THANK YOU I HEAR -- YOU ASIDE EIGHT THE OF A STORY AND OF WHAT THE INTENT IS -- AMONG MANY QUESTIONS -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OF BY BANNING -- THIS OF FOR PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT KIND OF WAY? ECONOMIC IMPACT THE OUT WILL IT MAKE COULD NEGATIVELY. AND WHAT KIND OF A RALLY NEW IMPACT THE TO THE STATE THE OR THIS TO BRING ABOUT THE IF YOU HAVE ANY FEE YES I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR -- SECONDLY IF WE MAKE -- THIS PRODUCTS -- THEN FOR SAY -- IN OUR STATE. AS YOU HEARD A WHILE AGO THAT THE WE CANNOT CONTROL THE WORD. OF THE SELF PRACTICE MAY BE -- CONTINUE IN OR THE STATE SO IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND IF I DESIRE WHEN I TRAVEL. I CAN BUY THEM. IN A IN A ESOS JUSTO OF CREATING INCONVENIENCE SO FOR THE ON A CONSUMERS. AND THIRD PARTY WE CAN SAY SO IN TO THE ANY MARS SO. AS SUCH -- OR LIVES MATTERS SO -- BUT THE SOME ANIMALS. THAT WE CONSUME US SUCH AS A LAMB. WE CAN KILL THEM AND EAT THEM DOES. NOT IN IN KHOMEYN BUT THE SOMEWHAT THE PRODUCTS -- THAT THE WE CAN USE. FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION OF FOR OUR NECESSITY AS SUCH AS THOSE ARE NOT THE HUMANE HOW DO YOU REALLY DEFINE. OF THOSE KIND OF A DEFINITION SOME ON A DIFFERENT ANIMALS. THANK YOU I'M. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TRIED OUT QUICKLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC IMPACT I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY EXACT FIGURES BUT WE THE BILL STILL DOES ALLOW THE SALE OF SOME OF CERTAIN FOR PRODUCTS. CAO SHEEP. LEATHER SO IF THEY ARE A BUSINESSES THAT ARE SELLING THOSE KINDS OF PRODUCTS. THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO SELL A MAIN CORE FOX BUT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SELL THOSE OTHER TYPES OF FURS AS WELL AS SYNTHETIC FIRST. SO YOU COULD STILL HAVE A STORE JUST BE SELLING A DIFFERENT TYPE REFER -- IN THEN ABOUT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT BUYING ELSEWHERE THAT IS TRUE YOU COULD BUY THE FOR ELSEWHERE. BUT US IN CALIFORNIA ACTING DOES SEND A VERY STRONG MARKET SIGNAL IT WOULD CHANGE OUR PRODUCT STREAMS FROM MAJOR MANUFACTURERS AS WE'VE SEEN WITH OUR FUEL VEHICLE STANDARDS FOR INSTANCE WHERE THEY DON'T JUST MAKE. THOSE HIGHER STANDARD VEHICLES FOR CALIFORNIA THEY MAKE THEM FOR THE REST OF THE NATION SO WE EXPECT THAT TO HAVE AN IMPACT BUT YES YOU COULD CERTAINLY BY FOR SOME OTHER PLACES. AS YOU CAN MANY PRODUCTS THAT WE DON'T ALLOW HERE FULL GRAW AND YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS -- AND I WOULD JUST ARMED. SAY TELL MISTER GALLAGHER I DO -- HERE YOUR ARGUMENT AND I UNDERSTAND IT AND I YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK THAT IT'S THE CORRECT QUESTION TO ASK -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT FOR THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE TYPES OF FOR THAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO IMPACT. ON OUR HUMANE I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE HUMANELY RAISED I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN TAKE AN ANIMAL THAT IS NOT A DOMESTICATED ANIMAL BUT A WILD ANIMAL LIKE A FOX SOME INK. AND REASON IN A VERY SMALL CAGE ANY HUMANE WAY IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT WANT TO ROMAN BE FREE. AND WE KNOW FROM NUMEROUS NUMEROUS EXPOSES HAVE BEEN DONE ABOUT THE FUR INDUSTRY AROUND THE WORLD THAT WHILE THERE MIGHT BE SOME. SOME YOU KNOW. A GOOD ACTORS IN THE SPACE THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD ACTORS IN TERMS OF HOW THE ANIMALS ARE SLAUGHTERED AND TRAPPED. AND SO I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE CAUSING MISERY AROUND THE WORLD. AND THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT BY ITS NATURE IS NOT ONLY UNSUSTAINABLE BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SOME BY PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED THESE ANIMALS WOULD NOT BE RAISED. THEY DID THESE WOULDN'T EXIST IF IT WASN'T FOR FOR A THERE AND IT'S NOT A BY PRODUCT OF SOME OTHER USE THEIR THERE FOR ONLY ANIMALS THAT ARE BEING TRAPPED. AND REYES AND THAT IS IN ITSELF NOT SUSTAINABLE FOR IS EASILY REPLACEABLE SO IT'S NOT A GOOD USE FOR YOUR SUIT GOOD USE OF RESOURCES -- WHEN THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES LIKE ANIMALS THAT ARE YOU KNOW WITH THE THE FOR IS A BY PRODUCT OF FOOD PRODUCTION SO I THINK IN ITS VERY NATURE IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE I BELIEVE IN ITS VERY NATURE IT'S IN HUMANE? AND I DO THINK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THOSE WHO CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND LASTLY I'D SAY BUT FOR DOES NOT IN BODY CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. OUR VALUES ARE OF COMPASSION AND SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE STATE TO SAY. THIS IS A A PRODUCT THAT WE BELIEVE DOES NOT IT DOES NOT FULFILL THOSE VALUES IT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IN OUR STATE -- GIVEN ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS AND BY ACTING WE DO. SEND A SIGNAL SAY ONE OTHER THING I REPRESENT HOLLYWOOD I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT TO DO WERE FOR SOMEONE I'VE SPOKEN TO THOSE PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT FOR COMES FROM THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS RAISED I DON'T KNOW WHAT COUNTRY CAME FROM. WHEN YOU TELL THEM A LOT OF THEM ARE KIND OF HORRIFIED SO IT'S NOT THE CASE THE CONSUMERS ARE ALWAYS MAKING AN EDUCATED -- DECISION AND I THINK THAT THIS ALSO SENDS A SIGNAL TO THEM THAT -- THAT MAYBE THERE'S YOU KNOW RATHER THAN GOING OUT OF STATE TO BUY FOR TO GO TO A MORE HUMANE ALTERNATIVE AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THERE IS A MOTION BY MISTER KALRA SECOND WAS GLORIA. LAST FOUR ROCCA. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. EDUARDO GARCIA GARCIA HI GALLAGHER.
