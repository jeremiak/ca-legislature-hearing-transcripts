WE PASSED AN ETHNIC STUDIES BILL LAST YEAR AND SO I FEEL THE NEED TO ALSO TELL THE TRUTH. DR KING WAS NOT LIKE. IN THIS COUNTRY. DR KING WAS WIRE TAPPED. DR KING WAS ARRESTED TWENTY NINE TIMES. DR KING WAS ASSASSINATED PROVIDING THE THING FOR THE THINGS THAT HE BELIEVED HE HAD MORE THAN A DRINK. HE BELIEVED THAT YOUR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND RACIAL JUSTICE WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED FOR UNIONS. AND IN RETURN HE WAS BEATEN. HE WAS SMASHED HE WAS GRABBED HE WAS THROWN IN A BIRMINGHAM JAIL FOR FIVE DAYS WITHOUT JUST CAUSE. AND IN THAT JOB HE WROTE LONG ORDER EXIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING JUSTICE. AND WHEN THEY FAIL IN THIS URPOSE THEY BECOME THE DANGEROUSLY STRUCTURED DAMS TO THE FLOW OF SOCIAL PROGRESS. DR KING TOLD THE TRUTH. DR KING FOUGHT FOR US ALL. NO MATTER HOW YOU REFLECT ON HIS HISTORY THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE DO ALWAYS REFRESH REFLECT ON EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND THAT IS HIS PURSUIT OF PEACE. TRUE PEACE. NOTHING TO FIND TRUE PEACE IS NOT MERELY THE ABSENCE OF TENSION. BUT THE PRESENCE OF JUSTICE. I THINK IT'S FITTING THAT THIS BODY EVERY YEAR STARTS ARE YOU'RE OFF RECOGNIZING THE HISTORY OF DR KING.

WE CONTINUE TO LIVE OFF OF THE WORDS THAT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD TODAY IN THE SAGE.

AND TO REMEMBER THAT THE DREAM THE MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD AND STILL PLAYS OUT TODAY IS FOR ALL OF US IN FOR THE VOICES OF THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE THOSE OF THAT HAVE BEEN A PRESS. THAT THAT VOICE STAND STRONG TOGETHER IN UNITY IN UNITY TO MOVE FORWARD TO COME AGAINST THOSE AREAS THOSE AREAS THAT NOW PLAGUES SO MANY PEOPLE THE COLONIZATION. SLAVERY WE SHARE THAT WITH IN THE NEW AMERICAN COMMUNITY WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE WITH OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO RECOGNIZE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE DREAM THAT MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD IS NOT JUST FOR WHAT PEOPLE IS FOR ALL PEOPLE. ALL PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION WE STAND SIDE BY SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DREAM MOVES FORWARD IN THE VOICES OF ALL INCLUDING THE A DIGIT AS PEOPLE STEPS TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND DR MARTIN LUTHER KING'S VISION THE MODEL OURSELVES AFTER HIM AND HIS PERSEVERANCE THAT HE MOVED OVER AND FORWARD FOR ALL OF US I THANK YOU AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS ACA. THANK YOU RESTAURANTS. MR GABRIEL. YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS TO HONOR THE REMARKABLE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRING FOR THIS RESOLUTION. JEWISH CAUCUS IS PROUD TO STAND WITH THE BLACK CAUCUS AND WITH CALIFORNIANS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS IN RECOGNIZING DR KING. AS ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS OF ANY GENERATION THERE'S A TRUE SYMBOL OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FOR ALL. AND AS WE CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS TRUE RACIAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE REMEMBER THE LEGACY IN LIFE OF DR KING. HE WILL ALWAYS OCCUPY A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF AMERICAN JEWS. FOR MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY HE WAS THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE QUEST FOR FREEDOM. FOR HUMAN DIGNITY AND JUSTICE BUT ARE THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE JEWISH TRADITION. THERE ARE FEW IMAGES THAT INSPIRE AS MUCH PRIDE AND EMOTION IN OUR COMMUNITY AS THE ICONIC PHOTOGRAPH. OF RABBI ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL THE MOST REVERED AMERICAN RABBI OF ANY GENERATION. MARCHING ARM IN ARM WITH DR KING ACROSS THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE IN MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. WHAT WHAT HE SAID AFTERWARDS WITH THE RABBI SAID AFTERWARDS IN WORDS THAT RECORDED BY PRESENT OBAMA HALF A CENTURY LATER LATER. HE SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS MARCHING WITH DR KING HE FELT AS IF HIS LEGS WERE PRANK. DR KING AS AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS MENTION WAS AN INCREDIBLE ALLY TO OTHER COMMUNITIES. CERTAINLY TRUE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY HE SPOKE OUT POWERFULLY. ABOUT OUR STRUGGLES ABOUT ANTI SEMITISM. ABOUT PERSECUTED JEWS IN THE SOVIET UNION. IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE MORAL VOICE FOR ALL PEOPLE FACING OPPRESSION. I THOUGHT IS INTERESTING ARE CALLING FROM LOS ANGELES MENTIONED THAT HE IS A- IN ETHICAL GUIDE POST THAT IT IS MOST APPROPRIATE THAT WE BEGIN OUR LEGISLATIVE SESSION REFLECTING. ON THE WORK OF DR KING. AND IT REMINDED ME ACTUALLY OF THE JEWISH HIGH SCHOOL IN MY DISTRICT DE TOLEDO HIGH SCHOOL. WHEN YOU WALK INTO THAT HIGH SCHOOL THE FIRST THING YOU WILL SEE IN THE ENTRYWAY IS AN ENORMOUS MURAL UP ON THE FRONT ENTRANCE. OF RABBI RABBI ABRAHAM HOW JOSHUA HESCHEL DR KING. AND THAT IS NOT AN ACTION IS VERY INTENTIONALLY PLACE THERE TO TEACH THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE LESSEN. ABOUT WHO WE VENERATE ABOUT WHO THEY SHOULD SEEK TO EMULATE ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE. THEY SHOULD LOOK AT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND RABBI HESCHEL AND UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE SEEK TO EMULATE. AND SO THIS WEEKEND JEWISH COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GONNA HOLD SPECIAL SERVICES AN HONOR DR KING OFTEN INTERFACE SERVICES WERE WE PARTNER WITH OTHER COMMUNITIES. WE'RE GONNA THINK ABOUT HIS UNFINISHED STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE. WE'RE GOING TO CELEBRATE SAID HOW MUCH SHE ACCOMPLISHED IN A SHORT TIME pREFLECT HONESTLY ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK IS LEFT TO BE DONE TO ALTERNATELY FULFILL HIS VISION. AND I THINK THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY THAT WE CAN HONOR THAT WORK IS PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS OF COLORS OF FAITH TRADITIONS OF KRIETZ COMING TOGETHER. AND CONTINUING HIS WORK FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AND RACIAL JUSTICE WITHOUT ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS RESPECTFULLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF ACR ONE SEVENTEEN. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH I RISE IN. ON BEHALF OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LET'S THAT OF CAUCUS. TO SUPPORT. THEIR COMMEMORATION OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING AND HIS LEGACY WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY WONDER WHAT DID DR KING MEAN FOR ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS SAYING. THAT ALL OF US INCLUDING ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE PRIVILEGES TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WE LEVIN AND GO TO THE SCHOOLS THAT WE GO TO AND WORK AND WORK PLACES THAT WE WORK AND- BUT FOR THAT IS DR KING'S LEGACY. AND YET TOO MANY ASIAN AMERICANS. DO NOT KNOW THIS HISTORY THAT WE ENJOY THE PRIVILEGES. AND BENEFITS OF PEOPLE THAT FOUGHT FOR AND DIED FOR THESE RIGHTS THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT IS OUR TIME AS WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST LED BLACK CAUCUS BREAKFAST IS OUR TIME TO NOW STEP UP AND FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS. AND AS MANY INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF SAID. THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR TIME NOW. IS TO FIGHT FOR VOTING RIGHTS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THAT DR KING IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ACCOMPLISHED IN TERMS OF ENSURING. THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR ALL AMERICANS IS NOT A ROAD ID. BYE EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE THE CREDIBILITY AND ABILITY OF ELECTIONS. AND WITH THE EFFORTS TAKEN ABOUT TAKING PLACE IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VOTE. AND SO ON BEHALF OF ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LESS THAN CAUCUS. I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON. AND REMINDING ALL OF US OF DR KING'S WORDS. THAT ALL IT TAKES. FOR EVIL TO PREVAIL. AND FOR US TO LOSE THE RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE FOUGHT FOR AND DIED FOR. IS FOR GOOD PEOPLE TO REMAIN SILENT. I REMIND ALL OF US THE IMPORTANCE VOTING RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION ACR. ONE SEVENTEEN. DR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR ONCE SAID. WE ARE NOT MAKERS OF HISTORY. WE ARE MADE BY HISTORY. SO I ASK US TODAY TO REFLECT ON THOSE WORDS. ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF PERSON HISTORY HAS CREATED IN YOU. AS WE NOW WITNESS THE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO DEMOLISH OUR DEMOCRACY WE SIT IN SILENCE OUR HISTORY WORLD IN YOU THE DESIRE TO FIGHT BACK BECAUSE OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR HISTORY WHO HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED TO KEEP DEMOCRACY ALIVE. AS WE NOW SEE THE WHEELS OF TIME BEING TURNED BACKWARDS. AS A NEW WAVE OF JIM CROW LAWS SWEEP OF OUR NATION. WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD THE OTHER WAY. OR HAS HISTORY GIVING YOU THE COURAGE TO NOT ALLOW US TO RETURN TO DARKER DAYS IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. AS WE SEE MANY OF US STILL FIGHTING FOR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. W DO CLOSE YOUR EYES WE'RE HAS HISTORY INSTILLED IN YOU THE RESOLUTION TO STAND FOR WHAT IS CHEST. AS WE SEE PEOPLE SO CRAVING FOR POWER THAT THEY WILL DO AND SAY ANYTHING EVEN IF IT'S A LIE. DO YOU SAY AND DO NOTHING. OR DO YOU SPEAK UP EVEN IF IT'S AGAINST PEOPLE IN YOUR OWN CIRCLE. M. OKAY ALSO SAID I AM NOT INTERESTED IN POWER FOR POWER'S SAKE BUT I'M INTERESTED IN POWER THAT IS MORAL THAT IS RIGHT THAT IS GOOD. SO I ASK US TO NOT JUST REMEMBER HIS LIFE OR HIS ICONIC I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH. BUT ALSO REMEMBER HIS FIGHT. AND HIS SACRIFICE AND USE THAT TO HELP SHAPE WHO WE ARE HOW WE FIGHT AND HOW WE SERVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU. P. R. ONE TEAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER MR COOLEY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I AM PLEASED TO RISE TODAY I MIGHT SAY ICE ARISES IS SURE TO SIMPLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER CARE HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER ANNA WHO'S OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HERITAGE. I HAVE A GRANDSON BEN WHO IS OF ASIAN HERITAGE. MAKES ME REFLECT UPON. THIS HISTORIC FIGURE DR MARTIN LUTHER KING ALL THE WORK HE DID. INCONTESTABLE HE BENT THE CURVE OF HISTORY. AND YET I ALSO REFLECT UPON IT IS RIGHT THAT WE CELEBRATE HIM IN THIS CHAMBER. BECAUSE EACH ONE OF US. HAS RESPONSIBILITY AN OFFICE FROM WHICH WE TOO CAN WORK TO BEND THE CURVE OF HISTORY. SO IT IS RIGHT THAT WE LOOK TO HIM FOR INSPIRATION. AND I WANT TO AFFIRM THAT THIS THIS IS THE INHERENT NATURE OF OUR WORK. AND PARDON ME FOR THIS REMINDER. THIS WEEK IN HONG KONG. IT IS REPORTED THAT THE NEW HONG KONG LEGISLATURE WAS SEATED. AND IT IS THE FIRST LEGISLATURE SEATED UNDER THE NEW BEIJING REQUIREMENT. THAT ALL LAWMAKERS BE PATRIOTS. A LETTER SAY BODY COMPRISED OF ONE OUTLOOK ONE VIEW IS NOT A LUXURY BODY. I THINK WHAT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING STAND FOR IS THE EMBODIMENT. OF WHAT OUGHT TO BE THE SPIRIT OF INQUIRY OF THIS BODY THE SPIRIT OF ADVOCACY OF THIS BODY. THAT WE ARE ALWAYS IN THE FACE OF THE NEEDS THAT WE SEE. OPEN TO SEE AN AND ARTICULATED WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO SOME AS WILD IDEAS. AND BECAUSE ONCE THOSE GET PUSHED OUT. THEN WE START TO HEAR THE PEOPLE WHO SEE THE OBSTACLES THE CRITICISMS WE MIGHT SEE CRITICISMS BUT WE WORKED IN OCTOBER'S OFF. TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT A VISION OF CHANGE AFFECTING HISTORY. AND AS SOON AS YOU START GOING DOWN THAT TRAIL OF BEING OPEN TO WILD IDEAS AS DR MARTIN LUTHER KING ARTICULATED AND START DEALING WITH WHAT MIGHT BE CRITICISMS THEN YOU START. WORKING OUT HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT A WILD IDEA YOU START DE RISKING IT. AND THEN AND ALL OF THIS WE NEED TO HAVE THE ELEMENT OF TIME. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS IS A DAY ABOUT DR MARTIN LUTHER KING BUT I THINK HE ACTUALLY. PERSONIFIES A- IMPACT ON HISTORY WHICH IS ACTUALLY OUR RIGHTS UNDER THE CONSTITUTION EACH ONE OF US TO BE THIS TYPE OF MEMBER THAT GRAPPLES WITH THE PRESIDENT WITH THE VISION OF THE FUTURE OPEN WILD IDEAS ABLE TALK ABOUT THE PROS AND CONS FIX IT TO AVOID ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES AND ALWAYS DOING THIS WHOLE TIME IS OUR FRIEND AND NOT OUR- MASTER. DRIVING US- MINDLESSLY FORWARD SO I THINK. IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO REFLECT UPON THE GREATNESS AND THE SINGULARITY. OF DR MARTIN LUTHER KING IN THE IMPACT HE HAD. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY. ON BEHALF OF MY GRAND KIDS BUT ON BEHALF OF EACH ONE OF US I WOULD JUST SAY WE ALL WANT TO OWN IT. BECAUSE WE ARE UNIQUE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIS OFFICE WE HOLD. AND THE MANTLE A BIT IN THE FUTURE WHICH- WHICH DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING CARRIED IS DOUBLE STORED UPON US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
