CERTAINLY GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ WITH THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA AYE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE TIME. ON THE AGENDA TO TALK ABOUT OUR PROPOSAL THIS MORNING. THAT YOU PROVISIONAL THERE'S A CALIFORNIA HAVE DONE ON SIGNIFICANT WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OVER THE LAST DECADE. TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE ARENA. WE HAVE LOWER DETENTION RATES BY SIXTY PERCENT A JUVENILE ARREST RATES BY SEVENTY THREE PERCENT. I'M ACTUALLY THE MAJORITY OF THE YOUTH THAT WE SERVE I'M A NINETY PERCENT OF THE YOUTH THAT ARE IN THAT COUNTY SYSTEM ARE ACTUALLY SUPERVISED IN THE COMMUNITY SO WE HAVE DONE. ON A GREAT DEAL OF WORK. REALLY ON THE FRONT END IN TERMS OF DIVERSION. AND PREVENTION WITH JUVENILE SERVICES. BUT KIND OF WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AS AS A RESULT OF THAT. CAN A DECADE OF PROGRESS IS THAT. THERE IN THE DAY YOU THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN OUR JUVENILE HALLS IN CAMPS ARE REPRESENT AND YOU KNOW YOU THOUGHT HAVE. SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND SOMETIMES VERY CUTE NEEDS A BIT OF COURSE ARE FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE MANY OF WHICH WHERE. I'M FROM DECADES AGO AND THEY REPRESENT KIND OF A DIFFERENCE. OUTLOOK ON. JUVENILE JUSTICE SERVICES ON WHAT WE ARE. REQUESTING. VIA THIS COMMITTEE TODAY IS A THIRTY MILLION AND ONE TIME STATE GRANTS THAT WOULD GO TOWARDS THE REPURPOSE SCENE OF. JUVENILE HALL. THE JUVENILE CAMP OR SOME PORTION THEIR OF. FOR THE PURPOSES OF. PROGRAMMING FOR THE PURPOSES OF CREATING MORE THERAPEUTIC HOME LIKE SETTINGS. ON SO THAT WE CAN REALLY MATCH UP ALL THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ON PROGRAMMING AND SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE OFFERED IN A SETTING THAT IS MOST CONDUCIVE TO TO THE JUST. THESE YOUTH BEING ABLE TO. REALLY BENEFIT FROM THOSE SERVICES. THIS AYE I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS WOULD PRESENT NO NEW BEDS ON TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS AS A NET REDUCTION POTENTIALLY WHERE. CERTAIN BED SPACE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE REMOVED FOR PROGRAMMING PURPOSES ON OR AGAIN REPURPOSE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SETTINGS THAT ARE MAYBE SMALLER GROUPS AND MORE HOME LIKE. AND SO WE WE SEE THAT REDUCTION AS WE MOVE TOWARDS KIND OF A DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT MODEL IN SERVING THE YOUTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON THE YOUNG ADULT POPULATION KIND OF THAT EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. ON ARE THE HIGHEST ON IS THE POPULATION THAT IS ON MOST NOTABLY GOING INTO STATE PRISON AND SO. ON BIKE AND CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THE JUVENILE ARENA WE FEEL LIKE WITHOUT ALSO HELPS CAN TO STEM THE TIDE. I'M AS TO WHO GOES INTO STATE PRISON AND THEN OBVIOUSLY HAS A RETURN ON INVESTMENT BOTH FROM THAT. THE ABILITY OF THAT YOU TOOK TO TURN THEIR LIFE AROUND ON AND THEN FROM THAT THE TYPE OF KIND OF FACTORS THAT THIS COMMITTEE LOOKS THAT. SO I WANT TO I STOP THERE AND INTRODUCE AYE CHIEF TERRY MCDONALD CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY AMONG WITH MANY OTHERS HAS DONE SOME WONDERFUL THINGS ON IN THIS AREA ON REPURPOSE SEEN FACILITIES SO I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER HER TO TALK LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. MADAM CHAIR TERRY MCDONNELL CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER MEMBERS GOOD TO SEE SOME OF YOU HAVE MET BEFORE I HAVE THE. THAT DISTINCT HONOR OF SERVING BOTH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS I LEFT THERE IS THE UNDERSECRETARY OF OPERATIONS OVER PRISON PAROLE JUVENILE JUSTICE REFILL TAPE SERVICES I THEN WENT ON TO OVERSEE THE REFORMS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAILS. WORKING FOR THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND NOW THE HONOR OF THE PROBATION SHE. A WHAT I KNOW IS IS THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS A BAD TOOL. FOR. HEALTH ISSUES AND SO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM EXPLODED. AND IT TIME IT EXPLODED IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM IS A BEGAN TO BUILD DETENTION CENTERS IN EVERY COUNTY. THAT WERE INFORMED BY WHAT WAS CALLED SUPER PREDATOR USE. AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT IN LA COUNTY HOSPITAL A COUNTY SPECIFIC WHERE FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT WELL DESIGNED. FOR THE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE THAT OUR CLIENTS NEED. OUR CLIENTS NEED THE ABILITY TO GOING TO GROUP AREAS TO CLASSROOMS TO LIVE IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT AREN'T LARGE DORM ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE. TO PROVIDE AN AREA IN WHICH CBO'S CAN COME INTO WORK WITH US TO PROVIDE TROHMAN INFORMED CARE WE CAN WORK WITH FAMILIES TO DO RESTITUTION WE CAN WORK WITH VICTIMS. TO HEAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VICTIMS IN YOUTH BUT THAT COSTS MONEY. LOS ANGELES COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE WITH CLOSE NINE CAMPS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ONE OF THE CAMPS THE BOARD AUTHORIZED YESTERDAY FOR US TO TURN IT INTO RESIDENTIAL VOCATIONAL TRAINING CENTER. FOR EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN THAT'S A MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT RENOVATION FOR THE COUNTY. NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH THE FOUNDATION TO PAY FOR THAT BUT IMAGINE. IF COUNTIES HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR FUNDS TO RENOVATE FACILITIES TO ADDED MORE TREATMENT FACILITIES TO REPURPOSE AYE AREAS FOR COLLEGES FOR. OF TRAITS FOR VOCATIONS AND REALLY BEGAN TO FOCUS ON THE PROFOUND NEEDS THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE. IT'S AFFRONT AND INVESTMENT THAT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE FORWARD INTO OUR JAILS AND PRISONS AND AND I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY IN CALIFORNIA THAT PROBABLY HAS A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. FROM ONE TO THE NEXT TO THE NEXT. I KNOW THAT IF WE CAN JUST HELP THE COUNTIES PUT IN THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO RESPOND TO IT IN A PLACE IN WHICH THEY FEEL SAFE. AND THEY FEEL VALUED AND WE UNDERSTAND THE TRAUMA IN WHICH WE GO TO IF WE CONTINUE TO RUN FACILITIES THAT LOOK LIKE LEVEL FOR PRISONS. OR BIG DORMS THAT LOOK LIKE. SOME KIND OF A HOMELESS ENVIRONMENT FOR USE THAN WE'RE GOING TO GET THE OUTCOMES THAT NONE OF A SEAT. SO WE URGE A SUPPORT TO THINK ABOUT DISABILITY FOR COUNTIES TO COMPETE FOR THIS I ALSO WELCOME YOU TO COME OUT TO CAMPUS KILPATRICK THE STATE INVESTED. OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SB EIGHTY ONE AND THE CAMPUS KIRKPATRICK AND THERE'S A LITTLE PICTURE OF IT RIGHT HERE. THIS FACILITY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A CAMPUS THE LIVING ENVIRONMENTS HOME LIKE FOR THE YOUTH THERE'S PLENTY OF PLACES IN WHICH WE CAN ENGAGE IN VOCATIONAL TRAINING THERE'S A. THERE'S A CULINARY ARTS SCHOOL THERE. THIS IS THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THIS GREAT STATE NEEDS TO GO IN AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT IN HELPING HELPING A PROBATION DEPARTMENTS DO THAT. THANK YOU. TAKING MY NAME IS FRENCH LZ BELL AND. I'M RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER DOING THIRTY FIVE YEARS SEVENTEEN ADULTS. YEARS WAS ATROCIOUS. PERIOD I DIDN'T GET IT. I HAD NO EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE. AS ARE YOU ARE BEEN TO ALMOST ALL OF HER FACILITIES. ALL THEY DID WAS PUT ME THERE TO KEEP ME SAFE AND AWAY FROM SOCIETY FOR THE CRIMES THAT ARE COMMITTED. IT WAS ONLY UNTIL LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE AT EVAN LOW STATE PRISON THAT I ACTUALLY LEARN. THE ORIGINS OF MY BEHAVIOR MY MISS PA EVERY PUT IT LIKE THAT. IF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO LEARN FROM. AND THEY'RE INUNDATED WITH IT. LIKE AVENAL STATE PRISON. IT'S A MODEL. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY. THE WARDEN MISS ROSEMARY INDO MADE SURE. THAT EVERY CORNER YOU TURN THERE WAS SOME KIND OF VOLUNTEER OUR FACILITATOR OUR GROUP. THAT WAS TEACHING YOU ABOUT YOURSELF DAY EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE THAT ONE NEEDS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND IF A CHILD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT DOES IT DO? IF I DON'T DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT DOES IT DO IT ASK QUESTIONS NOT A CHILD A CHALLENGES ACTS OUT. SO IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO GET. ANOTHER STAFFING. WHEN I SAY THAT. BASED ON THE ABBOTT NO STATEMENT IF YOU CAN FIND A WAY. TO GET IT WHERE EVERY CUANDO THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TURN. THEIR FACE WITH. THIS IS WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. AND TREATING WIT LOVE INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW MASS INCARCERATION IN A GM IT LOOKS LIKE A HOMELESS SHELTER. I THINK THIS WOULD. WORK MUCH BETTER IT WORK FOR ME. INTO WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT SOME. MY BEHAVIOR WAS BASED ON ME BEING MOLESTED AS A CHILD. IN THEY PUT THE PIECES OF THE PUZZLE TOGETHER FOR ME. THEY'RE NOT STARTED TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THE IMPORTANCE OF A MISSING FATHER IN MY LIFE. HOW IT ACTUALLY AFFECTED ME AS A YOUNG ADULT? DID IT MADE SENSE I WOULD PRISON AT. EIGHTEEN YEARSOLD I GOT OUT WHEN I WAS. FIFTY FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. AS ANY INFORMATION FROM. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. BELIAU. OKAY. ANY ANY INDIVIDUALS FROM THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YOUR TESTIMONY. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS YES MISTER STONE. THANK YOU. I THINK THIS IS INTERESTING BUT I HAVE. I WILL LOOK A LITTLE BIT BIGGER PICTURE. THE AT AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA'S LOOK AT THE OVERALL SYSTEM. AND SEE WHAT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO BETTER SERVE KIDS WHO GET IN TROUBLE FOR WHATEVER REASON I THINK YOU YOU BRING UP A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT. KIND OF CAUSATION WHICH WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO. SO IF WE REDESIGN THE SYSTEM SOME OF THE IDEALS WOULD BE KEEPING GETS CLOSER TO HOME BUT ALSO MEANS. DIVERTING KIDS INTO ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS WHERE THEY CAN GET SERVICES. AND SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL OF THE SEVERAL THINGS. AND ONE IS. THE WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS FITS INTO A BROADER STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES IN SOME COUNTIES ARE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB OF. TRYING TO DIVERT KIDS. TRYING TO SOLVE THEIR ISSUES THAN OTHERS AREN'T. AND SO IF WE'D BRING THE FOCUS WHICH I WOULD AGREE WITH BACK MORE TOHAVE TREMENDOUS CAPACITY IN JUVENILE HALLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE STATE LEVEL KIDS ARE CLOSER TO HOME. THAT'S A PLUS. BUT IF WE CREATE. BEDS WE TEND TO WANT TO FILL THEM. AND THAT MIGHT LEAD US TO A WRONG CONCLUSION THAT A WE HAVE THE BEDS LET'S. LOCK MORE KIDS UP THE NOT SO WE HAVE TO BE WARY OF THAT. AND I THINK FOR THOSE KIDS TO DO GET LOCKED UP I ABSOLUTELY WOULD AGREE THE PROGRAMMING. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDING THAT. IT A CORRECT SPACE IS HIGHLY CRITICAL. BUT I WOULD ALSO NOT ONE IS THEN TO LEAD TO THAT DIRECTION THAT WE HAVE ALL THESE GREAT FACILITIES SO WE NEED TO LOCK THE KIDS UP TO HELP THEM. WHEN THE INITIAL. INQUIRY SHOULD BE SHOULD THIS CHILD BE LOCKED UP. SHOULD THE SHALL BE DIVERTED ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH WE ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE IN THE COMMUNITY. GET THEM TO THE PROGRAM SO THAT THEY'RE NOT IN A JUVENILE SETTING. THOSE KIDS WHO DO NEED TO GO TO JUVENILE HALL SETTING THEN THIS KIND OF APPROACH IS ABSOLUTE PROGRAM FAR PREFER. TO TO WHAT WE HAVE DONE. SO WE HAVE TO BE I THINK COGNIZANT OF. DAY INCENTIVES THAT WERE SETTING UP AND ENSURING THAT THAT COUNTIES ARE PROVIDING. A HEALTHIER WAY OF LOOKING AT HOW THEY'RE DOING JUVENILE JUSTICE SO IF LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN AND I KNOW YOU YOU BEAR. A MUCH GREATER BURDEN THAT A LOT OF OTHER JUST BECAUSE A POPULATION THAT A LOT OF OTHER COUNTIES. BUT ALSO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT SENDING THE MESSAGE TO OTHER COUNTIES. CREATE FANCY LOOKING FACILITIES AND JUST LOCK UP MUCH KIDS UP BECAUSE THAT ALSO WORKS AGAINST EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO. TO CREATE HERE SO THERE'S THERE'S A BIT OF A BALANCE UP I'M ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTED IN THIS IN INTERESTED IN IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT I THINK. BIGGER PICTURE WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT. OVERALL WHERE WE WANT TO DO REAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO GO HOW WE CAN BETTER BENEFIT THOSE KIDS THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN A HEALTHY WAY IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOCKED UP. ABSOLUTELY PROGRAMMING SERVICES. AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE. TO FIXING THE ISSUES NEED TO BE FIXED AND GETTING THEM BACK OUT OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WOOD BECAUSE THEN THEY DON'T RESEARCH BUT THEY DON'T COME BACK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ADULT CRIMINALS. THAT'S A HUGE WIN. BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO PRESUME GOT A GREAT FACILITY SO LET'S WALK UP MORE KIDS THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE A TEMPTATION THAT I DO WORRY ABOUT JUST KNOWING. BUT YOU BUT KNOWING KNOWING SYSTEMS. SO THAT IT'S GOOD THAT THINK THAT WE'RE TAKING THIS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND AND SEE WHAT WE CAN REALLY DO ENCOURAGE. THINKING ALONG THIS LINE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO HAPPEN I OF THE BIGGER SYSTEM. HOW THIS FITS INTO WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING AND AND HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE WAR? JOB BEST PRACTICES SO THAT OTHER COUNTIES KIND OF COME. AND IT WAS JUST. JONES SAWYER. UMBRAGE SO RIGHT NOW THERE'S A. DIGITAL BID DEBATE GOING ON MIKE'S MIKE MEMBERS THAT IT OF KIND OF. THAT THIS. BUT IDEA OF WHAT THE CLOSE PRISONS OR REPURPOSED. AND IT'S KIND OF. WHAT KIND OF DEBATING AT RIGHT NOW YOU NEED ENOUGH FORTUNATE FEES AND DIVERT DOING IN REAL TIME? I DO BELIEVE THAT ENVIRONMENT MATTERS AND I AND I AND I THINK. S. MAN FOR COMING HERE BECAUSE HISTORIAS. IS PROBABLY. IF NOT ALL OF THE GOOD MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN LOCKED UP. THEY TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IF THEY'VE EXPERIENCE A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE ARE A LIKE TO STATE A POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER THAT DAY EXPERIENCE. AND THEIR HOME LIFE THAT ENVIRONMENT AND IN A GET. THE JUVENILE FACILITY. AND IT SOME WAYS IT TRAINS YOU THE MOVE ON INTO THE PENITENTIARY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM COLLEAGUES WE DON'T WANT TO SET UP. ON A SITUATION WHERE. ADMINISTRATION IS IT IS NOT WORKING REAL HARD TO PUT THEMSELVES OUT OF BUSINESS. AND IT AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT THE STATUS QUO IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN. A THRIVING INDUSTRY OF PRISON INDUSTRY AND AND SO I I MADE. I AM A FIRM BELIEVER THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE WAY. FIGURE OUT THIS BALANCE BETWEEN CLOSING AND REPURPOSE. WE HAVEN'T HAD A REAL GOOD DISCUSSION ABOUT REPURPOSE. AND AND SO FORTH IF WE COULD SHOW NOT ONLY THAT REPURPOSE SING WORKS. ON A ON A FACILITY THAT USED TO BE SHAPE FROM WHITE BUT ALSO ROI. YOU WOULD PROBABLY SPEND WHAT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER. JUVENILE. AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID WE COULD SEND SOMEONE TO S. C. FOR REASON FOR KIDS DESI. YOU CAN SEND A EIGHT KIDS UCLA A FULL SCHOLARSHIP EACH YEAR. RECEIVE A. SO WE'D DEFTLY PROGRAMMING BUT THIS WHOLE NEW COUNT THIS CONCEPT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THAT ENVIRONMENT. MATTERS. YOUR BRITAIN TO DISCOUNT A NEW US AND SO IF YOU COULD ALSO SHOW. ON A RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT FOR EVERY. AVERAGE YOUNG PERSON THAT COMES INTO THE FACILITY THAT DOESN'T. END UP IN THE PRISON SYSTEM THERE IS A. WE CAN QUANTIFY THAT. AND IF WEEK I WAS IN FRONT OF HIM KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE FROM COMING IN ORDERED THEIR STATE IS A LOT SHORTER BECAUSE THEY GET ALL THE. THE NECESSARY TO HELP THEY NEED. I SIGNATURE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER YOUNG PERSON PERSON IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY STATER THREE OR FOUR YEARS AND SO ON. I WHAT WOULD IT COURAGE YOU DID TO TRY TO BRING THOSE NUMBERS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE THAT. IF THE FUTURE LOVE UP. REHABILITATION A FUTURE OF CORRECTIONS IT'S. PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT ALSO SHOWING THE TAXPAYER AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REALLY. ONBOARD. WHICH REHABILITATION THAT. PEOPLE WHO USE THOSE TERMS THAT WE ALL DON'T. LIKE TO USE. THAT YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T SAVE EVERYONE. THAT'S TRUE BUT WE PROBABLY SAVE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY SAVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. SO IF YOU. HOW TO QUANTIFY THAT I THINK IT MAKES IT EASIER TO IT TO LOVE INVEST? USE TERMS LIKE INVESTED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN A BRAND NEW FACILITY. DIDN'T TO SHOW THAT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WILL BE AT SOME OUT AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION FROM YOU OR BILLION DOLLARS YOU COULD SAVE. OVER TEN YEARS AND THAT'S THAT'S WHY WERE MADE JUST KIND OF INVESTMENT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS IN ANY OTHER MEMBERS COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE FOR ONE LAST BRIEF COMMENT ON I JUST WANTED I ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND RESPONSE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER IS WHILE. I THINK. THAT THE CHIEFS CERTAINLY COMPLETELY SHARE. EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM MY NOT WANTING THIS TO BE IN LIEU OF. DIVERSION ON THE FRONT END AND SO. GOT CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE OUR INTENT AND WE WOULD WANT TO WORK I THINK VERYDILIGENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT ISN'T HAPPENING. AT AS I MENTIONED NINETY PERCENT OF THE YOUTH IN THE COUNTY SYSTEM ARE ACTUALLY ARGUED TO BE DIVERTED INTO THE COMMUNITY. BEFORE THAT SMALL POPULATION THAT IS LEFT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GIVING THEM THE BEST ABILITY WHILE IN THE HALL AND SO. AM I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS OUR COMMITMENT TO THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. ABSOLUTELY WANT TO EAT AT THAT THAT WE SHARE AND WOULD WANT TO WORK ON WITH THE OF. I HAVE ONE THING AS WELL SO IN THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT I AGREE I THINK WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT OR BEING DRIVEN NOT JUST BY PROGRAM BUT DESIGNED SO KILPATRICK. FOR EXAMPLE ARE ARKAN FLAGSHIP OF THE NEW LA MODEL. ALL OF THE METRICS EARLY ON WERE RESEARCHING INDEPENDENT OF US CHAU MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES IN THAT CAMP THAN OTHER CAMPS USED ON YOUTH VIOLENCE USED ENGAGEMENT YOUTH COMPLETIONS OF CLASSROOMS. BECAUSE THEY FEEL SAFE THEY FILLING GAUGE THEY FEEL LIKE EVERY TORN. CORNER THEY TRONG SOMEBODY THEIR CARES ABOUT HIM SO I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT DESIGN OF THAT FACILITY WILL DEMONSTRATE COUPLED WITH PROGRAM IS DESIGNED WITHOUT PROGRAM DOESN'T DOESN'T DO IT EITHER. WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH TO JUVENILE DETENTION IN AMERICA. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND OF MY COLLEAGUES AND AND OTHERS CLEARLY. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE AT A DIFFERENT PLACE AND WE WERE A FEW YEARS AGO. THAT WE HAVE REDUCED THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND JUVENILE HALLS AND IN THE VARIOUS. LOCKED UP FACILITIES THAT IS VERY VERY ENCOURAGING I THINK. EVEN BEFORE YOU CAME WE LOOKED AT THAT WE LOOK BEEN LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND SEEING THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE'RE LOCKING UP. AND THE KIND OF DIVERSION OR PROGRAMS THAT EXIST AS WELL AS TRYING TO PUT THEM IN DIFFERENT PLACES SO THEY WILL GET BETTER OUTCOMES THAT NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE WANT BETTER OUTCOMES. NOT JUST THE FINANCIAL REASONS BUT FOR THE MORE HUMAN REASON THAT PEOPLE'S LIVES NEED TO BE ENHANCED AND THEY DIDN'T GAUGE AND ACTIVITIES FOR REASONS. BUT WE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REHABILITATE. INDIVIDUALS AND AND WE CAN LIVE FOR MINDFUL OF WHAT WE DO SEPARATE SAY WHAT YOU DOING WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY. CLEARLY WE KNOW WE HAVE TO REPURPOSE THESE FACILITIES BECAUSE JUST THE STRUCTURE OF THE FACILITIES HIMSELF IS NOT IS NOT CONDUCIVE. FOR THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND DOES SO I APPRECIATE YOU COMING APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU DON'T. THANK YOU FOR GIVING YOUR TESTIMONY. THERE ARE MANY MANY WHO HAVE SIMILAR TESTIMONIES UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT. WE PLANNED TO DO BETTER AND WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO DOING BETTER SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT WE THINK. THAT BRINGS US TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN AUGMENTATION I'M GOING TO TURN THE MEETING OVER TO MR STONE I CAN. BECAUSE I HAVE TO ATTEND ANOTHER MEETING CONSERVATIVE BUDGET. THANK YOU. SO MS WEBER LETS ME RUN THE MEETING BUT. SHE MADE IT CLEAR I DON'T GET TO MAKE ANY OF THE DECISIONS. WHICH IS APPROPRIATE OKAY LANGUAGE ACCESS PRINT PLAN JUDICIAL COUNCIL YES I. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON SLOT CHO FEW GARBAGE THE BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. I'M AND I'M HERE TO BRIEFLY. GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF THE LANGUAGE ACCESS PROPOSAL THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE NAY REVISION. THE BUT THE BRANCH REQUEST A FOUR MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION TO ADDRESS. OTHER ISSUES OUTSIDE OF DIRECT. SERVICE FOR AYE LANGUAGE ACCESS ON A VERY CRITICAL ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES COMPREHENSIVE LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN THAT WE ARE REALLY APPRECIATE SEEING IN THE BUDGET. IT REFLECTS. A NUMBER OF CORE AREAS THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND IN PARTICULAR THERE'S FUNDING FOR SIGNAGE AT ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS. THERE IS A NEED AS FAR AS. GETTING FOLKS AS THEY ENTER THE COURT. KNOWING WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY ACCESS SERVICES. THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL I RELATED TO COURT INTERPRETER CREDENTIALING REVIEW ANOTHER ASPECT OF OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY AND ACCURACY OF THE SKILLS AND. OF THE INTERPRETERS. THERE'S TRAINING WITH FIND THAT THAT TO BE A IMPORTANT ASPECT OF. LANGUAGE ACCESS ENSURING THAT THE INTERPRETERS ARE I'M FULLY TRAINED ON THE SPOT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THERE IS A INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT AGAIN ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE THE PROPOSAL FOR ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS I'M RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS A MULTI LINGUAL DEVICES AND SELF HELP CENTER SO THEY WERE. LOOKING TO CREATE THAT NEXUS THERE AS FAR AS LANGUAGE ACCESS IN OTHER ASPECTS OF THE COURT. ON KIOSKS. INTERPRETER QUITMAN SUCH AS UPGRADED HEADSETS FOR THAT FOR THE INTERPRETERS TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK. MULTILANGUAGE COMMUNICATION OR FINDING THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE. VIDEOS. IN MANY OF MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AND SO THAT'S CRITICAL AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE A NECESSARY STAFF TO. SUPPORT THE. THOUGH DICK EXPANDED LANGUAGE ACCESS PROPOSED PROGRAM I'M TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OWN FINANCE REALLY OF ANY. THINK YOU'RE BACK IN HER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIS PROPOSAL CONTINUES AND BUILDS UPON THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT. TO PROVIDE FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. I. THINK I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM WITH THE HERNANDEZ STRATEGY GROUP ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF INTERPRETERS. WE JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE ITEM HERE OR NOT. AS IT RELATES EQUIPMENT HERE IN THEIR REQUEST I'M ISN'T USED FOR THINGS LIKE SPANISH AND FRESNO OR PROVIDING INTERPRETERS WHERE WE HAVE IN PERSON LIVE INTERPRETERS AVAILABLE. THAT IT'S ONLY USED TO FILL THAT SMALL GAP WHERE WE HAVE A LANGUAGE WHERE THERE'S NOT AN INTERPRETER AVAILABLE. AND THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO IF YOU'RE AYE BY FIRST APPEARANCE. AB BY VIDEO REMOTE SO WE JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT. ITEM IS. IS CLEAR. ANYWHERE ELSE I CAN ADDRESS THAT. IT WOULD ALSO A PUBLIC COMMENT. RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE. SIGH EC COUPLE AND ONE IS WHY NOW. IS THIS BEING BROUGHT FORWARD DID THIS COMES FROM. THE LANGUAGE ACCESS STRATEGIC PLAN THAT GOES BACK A FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE BUDGET. SO WHAT IF IT'S JUST WHEN THE TIMING OF THIS ISSUE WORKING WITH VOTE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE FIRST AND FOREMOST. NEEDS HAVE BEEN THE ACTUAL DIRECT ACCESS AND EXPANSION INTO SEVERAL. WHILE THESE HAVE BEEN A SORT OF ONGOING NEEDS IN THE DEN IF I NEED TO THINK IT WAS JUST A AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THAT THE. ADMINISTRATION TO REFLECT AND THIS IN THE BUDGET FOR US OKAY AND THEN IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS AN ONGOING DEBATE. THAT COMES THROUGH VARIOUS COMMITTEES PUTTING MY OWN ABOUT. RELIANCE ON ELECTRONICS VERSUS INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY WHERE WE HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AND AND WE WE DO HAVE THE VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING PILOT. IN PROGRESS AND SO THIS IS THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY EXPANSION OR AND CONTEMPLATED EXPANSION WE ARE COMMITTED TO COMPLETING THAT MANY AND DETERMINING ITS VALUE TO THE PROGRAM. SO THIS IS ONLY FOR CURRENT. PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN THE IN THE COURTS. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS LUMP. RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. SO WE WILL DO SO. THANK YOU. ITEM NUMBER THREE IS JUDICIAL BRANCH CAPITAL OUTLAY. MOST CHAIR AROUND THE HEAD AND THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES A NINE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL LEASE REVENUE BOND AUTHORITY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF FIVE COURTS. GLAND RIVERSIDE SACRAMENTO CINEMA AND STANISLAUS YOU CAN SEE THE SPECIFIC BUDGETS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED THEIR. THESE OH FIVE PROJECTS WERE PART OF THE ORIGINAL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IN ANTICIPATED A FOR. FUNDING IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET THAT THEY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO ACCELERATE AVAILABILITY. INTO THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AND WE DO HAVE INFORMATION AS FAR AS ANTICIPATED CONSTRUCTION DATES AND COMPLETION DATE SO WE CAN PROVIDE COMMITTEE IF THAT'S. DESIRED. OKAY. THANK YOU. BUT IT. ANY AND WITH IT WE HAVE MY CORNY HERE THE DIRECTOR OF OUR FACILITIES PROGRAM THE EVENT THEY HAVE SOME MORE DETAILED QUESTIONS ARE. PERFECT SO THE TROUT FINANCE. THERE'S NO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS WHERE WE COME AT THIS TIME. OKAY AND THEY'LL THEY'LL. WE ARE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THEM A REVISION PROPOSAL. WE FOUND THAT IT WAS PREMATURE TO PROVIDE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WITH THIS AUTHORITY. AS A NUMBER OF THESE PROJECTS ARE LIKELY TO BE IN PRE CONSTRUCTION DESIGN ACTIVITIES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE THE JANUARY PROPOSAL INCLUDES THIRTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION FOR THREE OF THE FIVE PROJECTS FOR PRE CONSTRUCTION DESIGN ACTIVITIES. THE OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD NOTE IS THAT WE STILL CONTINUE. AS WAS HEARD IN A PRIOR HEARING TO RECOMMEND THE BROADER CHANGES EITHER OVERHAULING THE COURT CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM OR MODIFYING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE KEY UNDERLYING ISSUES. THANK YOU. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. HANG ON A SECOND WE WOULD. GOOD MORNING CARE ALSO BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF SACRAMENTO IN SANTA ROSA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THEM A REVISION. PROPOSAL WE THINK THESE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PROJECTS FOR A COMMUNITIES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING GOING ON THE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. THE COMMISSION CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT A MAJOR VERSION PROPOSAL. ANYONE ELSE. RIGHT SEEN NONE I DO APPRECIATE HOW ELLIOTT WAS TECHNICALLY ADAPTS BAD MOVING THAT. MICROPHONES AROUND SORRY ABOUT THAT WE JUST DON'T SEEM TO QUITE HAVE THE FACILITIES WORKED OUT HERE BUT WE APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THAT. AND THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE. THIS OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WITH RESPECT TO THE LA SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY A FEW WORDS IN SUPPORT OF THE CAPITAL OUTLAY. BOB. MOST OF YOU WHO KNOW ME KNOW THAT I HAVE A GREAT PASSION FOR QUIRK FUNDING. AYE AND IT GROWS OUT OF EXPERIENCE I HAD WHEN I WAS THE MAYOR OF LOSING OUR COURTHOUSE AND SEEING OVER THE ENSUING YEARS THE IMPACT THAT THAT LOSS OF JUSTICE HAD ON THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENTATIVE AND. THAT IS REALLY NEVER LEFT ME. IF YOU ASK THE AVERAGE CONSTITUENT. TO A SHORT LIST OF THE NUMBER OF THE THINGS THE GOVERNMENT DOES FOR THEM. THE COURTS WOULD BE HIGH UP ON THAT LIST AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT GET DEBATED IN THIS CHAMBER WOULD NOT BE HIGH UP ON THAT LIST OF IN THAT THAT PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT. ABOUT THEIR ACCESS TO JUSTICE WITHOUT THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE THEY REALLY LOSE THEIR THEIR. TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE SO. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE OF OUR COURT SYSTEMS AND ALTHOUGH NONE OF THESE FACILITIES A BENEFIT MY DISTRICT. IT WILL BENEFIT THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE AND SO I THINK THERE ARE REALLY WORTHY OF SUPPORT AND. I CERTAINLY WILL VOTE IN FAVOR OF THEM ENTERTAINMENT OPTION. THANK YOU OTHER COMMITTEE COMMENTS. JUST WHERE I'M I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT BROWN AGAINST THERE'S DIFFERENT TIMETABLE. AND THERE'S SOME ARM. OVERALL COST ESTIMATES FOR THESE FIVE PROJECTS IN. AND AND HOW MUCH IT WILL BE IN. WHAT WHAT WHAT THE TAXPAYERS ULTIMATELY? SPEND ON THESE ON SOMETHING I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR. FOR FOR QUITE SOMETIME. AND I MEAN I'VE HAD JUDGES CALLED ME HAVE UNIONS CALLING ME. AND AGAIN I ASKED HIM THE SAME THING TO HAVE TO DISTRICT COUNCIL GET THAT INFORMATION TO ME. AS OF YET I'VE NOT RECEIVED INFORMATION AND I JUST FIND IT. THE LITTLE INSULTING. THAT A MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE CAN'T GET ANY INFORMATION. AND THAT I ASKED OVER AND OVER AGAIN FORWARD AYE THERE IS A PROBLEM. OR EITHER YOU DON'T WANT US TO KNOW WHAT THIS WHAT THIS WILL COST. AND SO THAT MAKE ME VERY SUSPICIOUS. GOING FORWARD ABOUT AUTHORIZING ANY SPENDING FOR ANY COURT COSTS. UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WRITTEN GRATEFUL TO GUARD TAXPAYERS MONEY. IT MONIES AND. I. I. YOU KNOW I'M ALMOST AT MY WHICH SENATE DISAPPOINT. SO. UNTIL I GET SOMETHING IN MY OFFICE. VERY SOON I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND TO THE CHAIR. THAT NOT ONLY WE WE FOLLOW WHAT THE LA O. ONCE GET WE DO MAYBE A FULL. AUDIT OR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ENTIRE PROJECT AND HOW MUCH WE'RE SPENDING. AND WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE ON TRACK WHERE THE NOT WE NEED TO JUST TOTALLY REVAMPED THE PROGRAM AND START OVER FROM SCRATCH. BECAUSE. RIGHT NOW AS SOMEONE WHO DONE IT BEFORE. AS SOMEONE WHO'S DONE IT INCORRECTLY BEFORE IN THE CITY OF LA. YOU'RE ON THE PATH OF WHAT WE DID IT CORRECTLY. AND WE COST THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE STATE OPERATES I'M IF DISSES DE THE WAY IT DOES DAN DE MAYBE WE NEED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. ABOUT HOW WE CONSTRUCT PROJECTS AND IN THE STATE. GOT I THINK IF YOU DID AUDIT YOU WOULD FIND OUT THAT WOULD PROBABLY. EXPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT. GO TO CONTRACTORS AND DON'T GET TOO BUILDING THE ACTUAL FACILITY OR PROBABLY WASTING MILLIONS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MANAGING THESE PROJECTS EFFECTIVELY. SO. JIM IS I GET THAT INFORMATION AND HAVE A DISCUSSION. AT. SO I'M AT MY WIT'S END PRACTICE POINT. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS.

THE TERM LIMIT CHANGE BEING RESPONSIBLE TO OUTCOMES IMPLEMENTATION IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE'RE TRACKING VERY CLOSELY AND OUR OBLIGATION OF DOING OVERSIGHT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO RELEARN. AND TAKE SERIOUSLY SO ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN HAVE. WHEN YOU HAVE REQUEST LIKE THIS TO ENSURE THAT THAT WE GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. ALRIGHT THANK YOU THAT ITEM AS WELL WILL BE HELD OPEN. WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR.

ENSURES THAT WE'VE COMMUNICATIONS BOTH ON THAT ARE ON THE. WEST SIDE OF THE SIERRA NEVADA RANGE ON THE EAST SIDE IN THE FARTHEST REACHES OF OF AYE NORTH AND SOUTH. HOWEVER IT IS A FIFTY YEAR OLD SYSTEM. OVER THE YEARS. WE'VE BEEN. ARE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN IT OUT AS WE POSSIBLY CAN BUT REALLY. THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS IS THAT IT IS AT A PLACE WHERE. YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY IS OVERCOMING US. AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM IS PRETTY PREDOMINATE AYE ANALOG SYSTEM. AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW WAR FORTUNATELY I WOULD SAY WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE. WE'RE MOVING TO A COMPLETELY DIGITAL. WORLD AND SO ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN. A BUILDING OUT INITIATIVES LIKE pTEXTING THAT NIGHT WHEN ONE IN VIDEO AND I WON ONE SERVICES. THE ABILITY TO DO THAT IS ALL BIG THAT DIGITAL AYE DATA IS BEING PUSHED OVER I'M FACT ALL OF THE. THAT THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WILL GO FROM A VOICE TO A A A DIGITAL. AYE FIBER SORT OF NETWORK AT THAT IS GONNA BE TIGHT THROUGH THROUGH THE MICROWAVES. AND. AND OF COURSE. TO OTHER CREEPY AND ISSUES THE FIRST NET BROADBAND BEING IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE'S PUBLIC SAFETY. INTER OPERABILITY COMMUNICATION NETWORK THAT TIES ALL AGENCIES TOGETHER PAN. THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM THAT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON A TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ALL THE MICROWAVE SYSTEM WALL. WILL BE CRITICAL AND ALL OF THOSE. THOSE ITEMS SO THIS REALLY BEGINS THAT. PROCESS HAS BEEN UP A LONG TERM EVALUATION OF EYES AND UP WE KNOW THAT. THAT. THAT ACTION. YOU KNOW IS IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS OF MOVING IT FORWARD INTO THE. INTO THE NEW. NEW YEAR'S OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. THIS THIS PROP PROJECT WILL BE. LISHI ADDED TO UPGRADE EFFECTIVELY AND GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE TO STAY IN FRONT OF THE EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY. THANK YOU. THE DIFFERENT FINANCE. I THINK YOU AMADOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT THE TIMING OF THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY LESS THAN IDEAL FOR EVERYBODY GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY. HOWEVER IT IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT TO THE SUCCESS OF NOT NEXT GENERAL ONE INTO IMPROVING OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NETWORK. THANK YOU EARLIER HOWLING CURSING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS BUT AS FINANCE NOTED THAT THE TIMING IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING THIS IS A. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND ALSO TECHNICALLY COMPLEX. KIND OF PROPOSAL ON IT'S DIFFICULT TO FULLY EVALUATE IN THE RIGHT MAY REVISE PROCESS. RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT. ACTIVITY BUT. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS BOTH THAT WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT AND A FUNDING SOURCE IN THIS TIME FRAME. THANK YOU ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. IF WE HAD A MORE HIGH TECH SYSTEM THIS WOULD BE EASY HAVE THAT WE CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT IF WE CAN. HAVE THE HIGH DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HELP US. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH I'M BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AT ASSOCIATION OF WHEAT ONE AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS AD MAY REVISION PROPOSAL AND WE WANNA. AND THINK OH YES AND WHEN I FULL SUPPORT OF THE REVISION AND ABSOLUTELY STAND TO WORK ON THIS AND A PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYTHING'S UPDATED THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. RIGHT SING THAT ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR PRESENTING THIS I. THINK THAT. PUBLIC OR DO WITH TECHNOLOGY CHANGES NOBODY'S EVER GOING TO KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT ANSWER IS BUT IF WE DON'T MOVE IN MOVE WITH ALL OF OUR. LOCAL AND REGIONAL PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM THEN. BOB IS GONNA GET WORSE AS WE GO ALONG SO WELL. WE'LL SEE HOW THIS ONE GOES. RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD THIS OPEN SO WE WILL DO JUST THAT AND WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. WHICH IS THE. YES AGAIN THE NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM. YEAH THIS STUFF THIS PROGRAM IS. HAVE BEEN PLACE FOR SOME TIME AND AND THIS IS REALLY. FINDING. IN WHAT'S CALLED ANTI TERRORISM FIND. THAT WOULD JUST SUPPORT. NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATIONS TO A BILL THAT AND. HARDENING. OF THEIR FACILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS PHYSICAL. SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF POTENTIAL COMMODITY VIDEO OR POTENTIALLY UP AYE AYE TERRORIST. KIND OF ATTACK. THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT IS A SUPPLEMENTAL TO OF TO THE FEDERAL PROGRAM. THAT. INTO INTO GAZA SEVENTEEN. THAT. THEM THE BIJAC PROVIDE A ONE TIME APPROPRIATION OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND. YOU KNOW IN IN. IN THIS YEAR WE RECEIVED OVER HER AND SIT A HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FOR THE THE PROGRAM TOTALING SEVEN MILLION. AND AND REALLY WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO FIND OUT ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT RECIPIENTS FOR THE TWO MILLION CELL. THIS ON GOING. PROGRAM AND AND DOES SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO ADDRESS. YOU KNOW AS WE SEE CONTINUE UNCERTAINTIES AND COMPLEXITIES IN OUR SOCIETY. I COULD TELL YOU THAT THE THE THREATS ACROSS THAT. THE STATE VARIED IN IN WAYS AND AND. MEANS BUT. CERTAINLY THE THE THE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT FIT INTO THIS CRITERIA. AREN'T ARE NO STRANGER TO THESE KINDS OF THREATS SO THIS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR. THANK YOU OR FINANCE NO COMMENT ALEJO. NO CONCERNS ANY MEMBER THE PUBLIC LIKE TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE WILL HOLD THE SIDE OF OPEN AS WELL. SO ITEM NUMBER SIX ALSO WITH. YES AND THIS IS THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE OPERATIONS YEAH THANK YOU I'M. SO THIS UP PARTICULAR. INITIATIVE REALLY STARTED OVER THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE IDENTIFY BACK THEN THE THE THE GAPS. IN ART OUR CAPABILITIES TO DEAL WITH THE VARIOUS KINDS OF ISSUES THAT WE. WE'RE FACED WITH. AT THAT TIME. THE LEISURE FOUND. THE. AREA PRE SHAPED UP THE THE NEED TIP TO SUPPLY AS WITH SOME. ARE RESOURCES BUT. THEY DID NOT. YOU KNOW SUPPLY ALL THE RESEARCHER ACT ASKING FOR AT THE TIME. WITH THE. WE STILL HAD A GAP OF. OF TWO POSITIONS IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS AND AND SICK POSITIONS THAT ARE ARE REGIONAL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS. I SWAM A POINT OUT THAT THE THAT THESE POSITIONS IN AND. AND WE HAVE BEEN THE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE FIVE SIX SUB THE MUTUAL AID REGION'S AND. WHERE WEEK WE ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE COORDINATE? AND ENGAGE. LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID AND AND AND DEAL WITH THE INTELLIGENCE SHARING AND INFORMATION SHARING IN OUR SIX. OF FUSION CENTERS. THAT THAT THE CENTERS ARE AND THESE THESE. REGIONS ARE ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT THE STATE HAS. COMPLETE COVERAGE IN IN MOVING A LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSETS AROUND A BOTH PRE IN IN INFORMATION SHARING. OUR AND. DURING AN EVENT AND THEN IN THE RECOVERY PHASE. AND. THIS WOULD FILL OUT THE COMPLEMENT OF THE SEXES THAT OF THE FOUR THAT DOUBT THAT WE WERE ALLOCATED DRY PREVIOUSLY SO THERE. WITH THEIR IMPORTANT. APART POSITION SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY POSITIONS THE SIX ARE EMERGENCY REGIONAL RESPONSE IN WRITING THIS POSITIONS THESE ARE EMERGENCY SERVICES PERSONNEL THAT. ARE SIGNED WE AGAIN WE HAVE SIX MUTUALLY REGION'S THESE FOLKS ARE. ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE ENGAGING DATED DAY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN OUR SIX OH REGIONAL CENTERS AND. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE ENSURING THAT UP PLANS ARE IN PLACE. THAT THE OPERATIONAL CONSTRUCTS ARE THERE SO THAT WE'VE GOT THIS THAT THE COUNTIES CAN EFFECTIVELY RESPOND AND THEN THROUGH THAT RECOVERY PROCESS INSURING THAT THAT RECOVERY AND THAT RECOVERY. INITIATIVE AYE INTEGRATES EFFECTIVELY. AND THAT AND THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND WITH THE LOCAL COUNTIES AND CITIES. THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DISASTER. NOT GOING TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE IDENTIFIED THESE NEEDS THREE YEARS AGO THAT THEY'RE STILL A MAJOR NEED FOR US TODAY. THIS PAST SUMMER THIS PAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE LITERALLY WHERE. WE WE YOU KNOW WE'RE MANAGING THREE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. WITHIN THE STATE WHERE LITERALLY HAVING TO PULL PEOPLE OUT AND FLY THEM AROUND MOVE THEM AROUND THEY WERE DEPLOYED FOR OVER A YEAR. THESE THERE'S THAT THE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THESE PERSONNEL WERE QUESTION. AND AND WE JUST NEED TO GET THESE FOLKS TO APLACE WHERE WE HAVE THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO THEM. TO. PROVIDE THE SERVICES ARE THESE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY POSITIONS. I KNOW THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO DO A LIMITED TERM THE PROBLEM IS THESE ARE PUBLIC SAFETY POSITION SELF I WANT TO. BRING ON LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL FIRST OF ALL ABSENTEES LEAVING THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY HAS TO KNOW THAT THERE THERE'S A A CAREER PATHWAY FOR THEM AND THAT THEY'RE. THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE THEIR THEIR THEIR ORGANIZATION TO COME TO WORK FOR THE STATE. THEN THERE'S THE WHOLE BEYOND THE RECRUITMENT. THAT THEY'RE SO HOPE BACKGROUND WHICH TAKES ALMOST A YEAR TO DO. AND THAT WE DON'T ALL HAVE A FOR A YEAR SO I I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET ANYBODY TO APPLY. THE SAME EMERGENCY SERVICES. AREA. THEY DON'T HAVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE SITE POLYGRAPH AND WEAPONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DO BUT THEY HAVE ALL THE OTHER ASPECTS. AND. AND AND AND REALLY DOESN'T DO AS MUCH COULD ONLY DO THIS FOR FOR TWO YEARS WE WOULD REALLY NEED THESE PEOPLE FOR THE LONG TERM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU PART OF FINANCE. I WHAT WE'RE WE AGREE WITH ALL THOSE COMMENTS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ON GOING STAFFING NEEDED FOR THAT DEPARTMENT. THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE HAVE IS THAT IT'S HARD TO PREDICT WHAT DISASTERS ARE GOING TO OCCUR AND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO RESPOND TO THEM AND WE THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED SUFFICIENT JUSTIFICATION. I'M NOT ONLY PREVIOUSLY BUT NOW FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU ELIA. SO WE'VE RAISED CONCERNS IN THE PAST ABOUT CHALLENGES. IN IDENTIFYING IN JUSTIFYING THESE ADDITIONAL STAFF AYE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND. BACK ESPECIALLY. FROM THE NATURE OF THESE TYPES OF POSITIONS. AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE HAVE TO ASSESS IT WHILE WE DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU YEAR LIMITED TERM WHICH WOULD ALLOW. AYE THE LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT STAFF AND WHEN THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF TIME AND AND PERHAPS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. AVAILABLE. THANK YOU A MEMBER THE PUBLIC. SINGER AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE WILL TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT AND HOLD THE ITEM OPEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN OR ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. WHICH IS HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM WORKLOAD INCREASED RIGHT SO THE HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAM. IS. IS A PROGRAM THAT GETS IMPLEMENTED. AFTER DISASTERS. OCCUR EMERGENCIES OCCUR. AND DOWN AND THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS IS FOCUSED THAT. TAKING. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE DISASTERS THAT WE'VE SEEN THE KIND OF DAMAGE THAT HAS OCCURRED. AND AND PUTTING IN PROGRAMS THAT WOULD. UP BY DOWN FUTURE. IMPACTS OF OF. OF DISASTERS. IT'S IT'S BROUGHT IN ITS. IT IT'S. APPLICATION OF THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT IT CAN BE. I UTILIZED FOR BUT REALLY. THE KEY THE KEY ISSUE IS TO REDUCE. DISASTER LOSSES PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY. FROM FUTURE DISASTERS NOW. CALIFORNIA HAS A. HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. IN IN THE IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. A TYPICALLY FEMALE. WHEN THEY PROVIDE DISASTER FUNDS PROVIDES. UP TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE TOTAL COST OF A DISASTER TO A STATE. AYE IN HAZARD MITIGATION FIVE BUT BECAUSE OUR PLAN. IS WHAT'S CONSIDERED ENHANCE PLAN THAT BECAUSE IT'S JUST IT'S JUST THEY BUT WE GOT A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH OUR PLAN. FEMALE WILL PROVIDE IS UP TO TWENTY PERCENT OF. OF THE COST OF THE DISASTER SO FOR THE SERIES OF THIS ASKED WE STE WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST. TWO YEARS. THAT EQUATES TO OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND. HAZARD MITIGATION FUNDS THAT ARE COMING IN FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU'RE COMING AND. YES AND THE WORKLOAD. TO BE ABLE TO. TO MANAGE THESE THE THE SPEECH PROGRAMS FROM FROM THE BEGINNING ALL THE WAY TO THE AND TO GET THEM IMPLEMENTED IN ENSURE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND MONITORING. IS A FEW SUBSTANTIAL AND THIS PROPOSALS ASKING FOR BROWN. FOR ASSISTANCE IN THAT AREA. THANK YOU PRONE FINANCE. I AM I THINK THE LA WAS EXPRESSED SOME CAN INTEREST IN USING THIS HOUSING MITIGATION FUNDING NOT NECESSARILY IN THIS PROPOSAL BUT THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE FEDS. IN USING IT FOR A STATE PROJECTS THAT ARE ONGOING NOW ARE THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED TO. I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT AND TO THE EXTENT WE CAN USE THAT FEDERAL MONEY WE WILL. BUT FOR THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS I THINK MY RESPONSES ARE PRETTY OUTLINED IN THE AGENDA BUT. TO THE EXTENT WE CAN USE THAT WE WELL BUT FOR THE PROJECTS I THINK. FOR THESE SPECIFIC ONCE WE CAN'T. THANK YOU AND ELIA. SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS ON THE STAFF AND FUNDING THAT'S PROPOSED HERE AS FINANCE MENTION OUR COMMENT WAS JUST A FLAG FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL INFLUX OF MONEY THAT WE'RE EXPECTING I'M PERHAPS SIX HUNDRED MILLION. THERE ARE SOME SOME PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE FOR SPENDING THOSE FUNDS. BECAUSE THEY CAN GO TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE KINDS OF RISKS WHILE THE CPAS IT SOUNDS LIKE THE SPECIFIC. ON ACTIVITIES THAT. THEY'RE PROPOSING THE MAY REVISE MAY NOT BE OUT OF ELIGIBLE FOR SOME TECHNICAL REASONS. SOME THE GENERAL TYPES OF ACTIVITIES CAN INCLUDE THINGS RELATED TO. REDUCING UP OF FLOOD RISK FIRE RISK SOME OF THE KINDS OF RISK THAT THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. I'M SO YOU THINK IT'S WORTH ON THE LEGISLATURE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE OF WHETHER IT HAS PRIORITIES FEES FINES AND IF SO. HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE REFLECTED. THANK YOU ANY MEMBER THE PUBLIC. SEEING NONE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT YEAH THIS ITEM I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL LAID OUT AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD IT OPEN AS WELL THANK YOU I DO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT. WHICH IS RECOVERY PROGRAM WORKLOAD INCREASE YEAH AGAIN. SO THE OTHER PART OF OUR OUR DISASTER RECOVERY. BRANCH. OPERATIONS IN INCLUDES THE ACTUAL RECOVERY. FROM THESE DISASTERS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. WITH THREE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. OUT LAST YEAR AND THEN. THE PREVIOUS YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WE HAD FIFTY TWO OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THE FEDERAL DISASTER. AYE DESIGNATION. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAINFALL AND AND FLOODING WE HAD. A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AND GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE VALLEY INN AND BUTTE FIRES OUT WHICH ARE FEDERAL DISASTERS AND AND I A WHOLE LIST OF. OF STATE ONLY DISASTER THEY'D ONLY DISASTERS ARE DISASTERS THAT ARE UP ABOVE THE THE CAPABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOB BUT BELOW THE ABILITY TO GET FEDERAL DISASTER AID THERE'S A WHOLE. PLETHORA OF THOSE. AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WE DEAL WITH THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT OF ALL THOSE ARE NUMBER OF OF PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE. I ADDRESS THIS IS DIRECTLY WORKING WITH YOUR CONSTITUENTS YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT ISSUES LIKE YOU KNOW ROADS AND PUBLIC FACILITIES AND PARKS AND. OTHER KINDS OF OF. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS DAMAGED OR DESTROYED IN THESE ADVANCE. GETS REBUILT IN A VERY EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MANNER. AND SO. BOB THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT THESE PROCS FOLKS DO EVERYTHING FROM INSPECTING DAMAGE FACILITIES. ARE TO PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE ON OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION. ASSISTING THROUGH THE AUDITING APPEALS PROCESS TO MADE THE REPORTS REQUIRED TO THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY. AND. AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS THE BOARD. SO. THE WORKLOAD IS UNBELIEVABLE AT THIS POINT AND. AND. TO TO TRY TO KEEP THIS ALL GOING IN AND GET EVERYBODY'S COMMUNITIES BACK UP TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE. I GET THE MONEY IN PLACE. IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND CRITICAL WORK UP THE OTHER THING THAT THESE FOLKS DO IS HANDLE WHAT'S CALLED THE FAT THE FEDERAL. FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS. IT'S A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES. FEDERAL DOLLARS AT THE FRONT END OF A FIRE. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO FIREFIGHTERS DURING THE. AND COMMUNITIES DURING THE THE FIRES OUT THOSE F. MAKES A VERY CRITICAL AND UP BUT THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF. ABOVE FEDERAL CRITERIA THAT NEED TO BE ATTRACTED THAT WHOLE PROCESS ALL THE WAY TO THE REIMBURSEMENT TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO. THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT HEAVY WORKLOAD AND. WE SUSPECT IT WILL BE THIS WAY FOR A FEW YEARS TILL WE GET TO ALL THESE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU TORN FINANCE. HELLO. ANY MEMBER THE PUBLIC WITH COMING ON THIS ITEM. ALRIGHT SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SINGER WE WILL HOLD THAT OUT OF OPEN AND WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE. WHICH IS THE REASON REGIONAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE PROGRAM YEAH ON THIS ONE HERE OF SO JUST SAYS UP OF OLYMPIC CONTEXT THIS SIDE GOES BACK. TO. THE UC A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN OF THE LEGISLATURE FOUND FIT TO PROVIDE EYES OF FINDING. TO PROCURE UM. SOME SPECIALIZED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE UNITS ARE AND BUILD A CAPABILITY AROUND THOSE. A IT'S A CAPABILITY THAT DID NOT HAS NOT EXISTED AT THE STATE LEVEL. WHERE WE COULD ACTUALLY COUNT ON? I HAD JUST MATERIALS MUTUAL AID RESPONSE CAPABILITY OF THIS WAS REALLY DRIVEN AT THAT TIME BY THE AMOUNT OF OUR. OF OUR HIGH OF VOLATILE A CRUDE OIL THAT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS YOU MAY REMEMBER THERE ARE. SOME MAJOR CATASTROPHIC AYE DERAIL MATES AND FIRE EXPLOSIONS THAT OCCUR IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE U. S. AND CANADA LOT OF FATALITIES. WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT NOT HAVING A CAPABILITY WAS A MAJOR GAP THAT WE HAD IDENTIFIED. IN OUR STATES ABILITY TO RESPOND LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT GAVE US THE HOUSE MATERIALS PRODUCTS THAT WERE COMING INTO THE STATE. AND THERE WOULD BE OVER THERE WOULD BE THIS SELF ASSESSMENT OF FUN THAT WE WOULD COLLECT THAT ASSESSMENT TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE PROGRAM. BUT TO GET HIS JUMP STARTED BECAUSE IT WAS AT A CRITICAL. TIME SENSITIVE ISSUE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF OF A MATERIAL THAT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED AND NOT JUST. CRUDE OIL THERE'S A WHOLE. WHOLE TON OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF MAJOR HELLISH MATERIALS FROM MODERATE TO VERY VERY EXTREME. IN NATURE THEY GET MOVED BY RAIL. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY. THAT THIS WAS REALLY AN URGENCY SO WE WERE FRONTED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WE PROCURED THESE SPECIALIZED UNITS. WE BEAT BUT TRAIN THE INITIAL TEAMS ARE THAT WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH. WELL THE PROCESS WAS TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO WOULD STAFF THESE UNITS WE REPLACE THEM STRATEGICALLY THROUGHOUT ARE MUTUALLY REGIS IN THE STATE. AND THE. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE WOOD. WOULD. STAFF THEM AND WE WOULD PROVIDE THEIR THEIR EQUIPMENT THE TRAINING. AND. AND ALL OF THE EXERCISES. SO WE'VE GOT SIX OF THE TWELVE IN THE IN THE FIELD. AND DOWN THE OTHER SIX ARE DESTINED TO GO OUT THIS NEXT WEEK. AND DOUBT THAT. THE COURSE DURING THE PROCESS THE RAIL INDUSTRY SUED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LAWSUIT IS IS CURRENTLY. IN OF THE COURTS. WHICH HAS THEN. THEY PUT AN INJUNCTION OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT A FEE. AND SO WHILE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS. SORT OF MESSED UP STOPGAP WHILE WE CAN GET THROUGH THE. THE LEGAL. AYE RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS. AND THIS YEAR AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP THIS PROGRAM WRITING. OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. TO ENSURE FOR THE FOR THE MAINTAINING THE TRAINING. AND THE AND THE EXERCISES OB ONE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IS WITHOUT THAT. ADDITIONAL FUNDING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS ARE APPARENT AND WILLING TO TAKE ON THESE. UNITS BECAUSE THEY. DON'T WANT TO TAKE THIS SPECIALIZED RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT BE ABLE TO TRAIN THEIR PEOPLE HAVE TRAINED PEOPLE THAT THE COURT WOULD THE COURT WOULD JUST SIT THERE. SO. SORTS OF A CHICKEN AND EGG SITUATION WHERE WE NEED FUNDING TO KEEP IT GOING. BUT WE NEED TO KEEP GOING BECAUSE OF THE THREAT. AND. AND AND THAT'S ALL ORBITING AROUND THE THE LEGAL CHALLENGES SO ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE US WITH EXTRA A STOPGAP FOR THE PERIOD TIME. THANK YOU TORN FINANCE. AND SO DOES THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN HOW THIS FOR PROGRAM WE FIND IN THE FUTURE THAT'S WHY THIS REQUEST IS ONLY FOR THREE YEAR. LIMITED TERM RESOURCES WHILE WE AWAIT THE OUTCOME OF THOSE LAWSUITS. AND I ALSO KNOW THAT ANY PROPOSAL THAT WE SUBMIT IN THE FUTURE FOR ONGOING COSTS WILL INCLUDED. A PLAN FOR FUNDING THOSE COSTS AND ALSO PLAN TO REPAY ANY LOOKED THE LOANS FOR TEMPERATURES THE FIRE ENGINES. THANK YOU ALEJO. I SERRANO RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF PROVIDING RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO SUPPORT THESE. THESE VEHICLES WE AT THERE'S. ONCE AGAIN VERY LITTLE TIME TO ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING LEVEL AS WELL AS SEWERS I'M SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING APPROVING THIS ON A ONE YEAR BASIS THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT THE STATE COULD DEPLOY THESE VEHICLES BUT IT WOULD ALLOW NEXT YEAR US TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE BENEFIT OF. A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME. TO GET AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE ON THE LAWSUIT AND OR TO CONSIDER SOME OTHER POTENTIAL UP FUNDING SOURCES SO WHEN WE REVIEWED THIS PROPOSAL THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL A FEW YEARS AGO. I'M WE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER OPTIONS THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD PASS THIS AS A TAX RATHER THAN. AS IF HE'S HE COULD PASS WITH A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY. POWERED POTENTIALLY THE FEE COULD BE EXPANDED BEYOND RAIL ON TO OTHER KINDS TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES. THAT. CARRY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS OBSERVER EIGHTY DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE WE THINK IT'S WORTH REVISITING IT NEXT YEAR SO THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND THAT WHEN YOU'RE. THANK YOU. ANY MEMBER THE PUBLIC. SING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. YOU MENTIONED PASSING IT IS A TAX WITH TWO THIRDS IS IF THAT WERE SO EASY YES RIGHT YEAH EXACTLY WE'RE GOING TO. HOLD THAT ITEM OF. YEAH. THANK YOU SO THAT I WILL BE HELD AYE ISSUE NUMBER TEN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND COLLABORATION TOOLS JOB THIS SOME THIS IS A. UP PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT ACTUALLY STARTED AND WAS FUNDED INITIALLY BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. ARE IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH US IN CALIFORNIA AIR TO DEVELOP A CAPABILITY WAS BUILT IN BY BY MIT LINCOLN LABS. AND IT REALLY IT'S A IT'S A COLLABORATIVE TOOL THAT. THAT GIVES US. REAL TIME INFORMATION. AND THE ABILITY TO SHARE INFORMATION RELATED TO. DISASTER VANCE FIRE. WHATEVER IT'S ALL HAZARDS AND IT'S A REAL TIME AND IT INCLUDES THE THE ABILITY TO MONITOR AND AND VISUALIZE THE MOVEMENT. AND PATH OF FIRES EVACUATION AREA DEBRIS AREAS. EIGHT IT SHOWS. WITH. THE RECENT EXPANSION OF AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATING CAPABILITIES ON THE CAL FIRE UNITS ON THE. WE S. ENGINES AND ON A NUMBER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAPABILITIES WE CAN SEE IN REAL TIME THE MOVEMENT OF OF GROUND CREWS FIRE ENGINES A LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES AND DOWN. AND HELICOPTERS AIR AIR ASSETS UP THIS REALLY DOES REDUCE CONFUSION MISCOMMUNICATION IS BY. BOB PROVIDING YOU KNOW A MAP DISPLAY AND ALLOWING US TO TO TO MAKE A REAL TIME DECISIONS THAT IN THAT IN THAT TIME FRAME THAT'S. IT'S REALLY NECESSARY. IT SUPPORTED NOTE THAT. YOU KNOW. WE. WHERE WHERE THIS THIS IS REALLY? WERE WORKING ON. ENHANCEMENTS OF THIS WE'VE KIT WE PICKED THAT UPS FROM THE H. S.. AND. WE'VE HAD TO UPGRADE THE CODE IN SOME OF THE THAT THE TECHNICAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY ARE BUT WE ARE USING IT TODAY. ALL REQUIRES. SOME ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY TIM TO MANAGE. IT HAS BECOME BECOME A CRITICAL TOOL FOR US AND WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING UP OF A STRUCTURE THAT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE. WHERE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE THEIR JOINING ON? THERE WILL BE A LIKE UP. A. S. SUBSCRIPTION KIND OF SERVICE THAT WILL HELP OFFSET THE COST OF THIS ARE IN THAT IN THE FUTURE TELL THIS IS JUST A REALLY IMPORTANT. SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOL THAT WE WE UTILIZE. THANK YOU PRIVATE VIOLENCE BELIAU. REMEMBER THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU ARE ON ON THIS ONE AND I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND NOT SURE WHAT THIS COMMITTEES ULTIMATELY GOING TO DO WITH THAT BUT. WITH THE FIRES THAT HAPPEN ACROSS STATE AND WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION THERE'S ALL THIS CONVERSATION NOW HOPPING ABOUT WHAT WE DO NOW. WITHOUT A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO UP FRONT AND THE FIRE CHIEF HAVE A PROPOSAL THAT I THINK IS GOING THROUGH SUB THREE. THIS KIND OF CONNECTIVITY AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE ASSETS ARE AND HOW TO MOVE THEM AROUND IS ULTIMATELY. I THINK GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO. BEING ABLE TO MOVE RESOURCES AROUND THE STATE AND RESPOND BECAUSE THE POINT IS TO. STOP AN ISSUE FROM GETTING BIG FITS OF FIRE FLOOD BEFORE. TO EXIT WE CAN. BEFORE BECOMES SUCH A MAJOR DISASTER AND THEN THESE ARE THE TOOLS THAT HELP THAT HAPPENED WAS I KNOW YOUR CONTACT WITH THE FIRE CHIEFS AT ALL AND WE SHOULD. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A COORDINATED APPROACH TO THIS. AND WE'RE HAVING THE THE BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT ADDRESSING SAFETY RISK MORE UP FRONT RATHER THAN JUST CLEANING IT UP YEAH AFTER ALL YOUR APPS AYE YOUR SPOT ON. THIS OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITHOUT. THE FIRES CHO BORED DIRECTOR WHICH IS THE STATE'S FIRE STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATION AND AND CAL CHIEFS AND METRO CHIEFS ON THIS. THIS IS THAT THIS IS THAT ABILITY TO. GO FROM A REACTIVE SYSTEM TO A PROACTIVE SYSTEM THIS GIVES US THAT THAT VISUAL ON THIS ON THE FRONT END OF THE OTHER EVOLVING CRISIS SO. WERE HOPING THAT THIS IS THE OUT ONE OF THOSE THOSE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX RAZA MEMBER AND THEN THAT'S WHERE MY COMIC IS. I AGREE IN IN. THE COUNTY THAT I COME FROM SOME OF THOSE ARE IN PLACE NOT COMPLETELY BUT THAT'S. DO YOU SEE BILLY RESPONDED URBANIZED AREA TO A FIRE THAT STARTS. KEEP IT FROM GETTING TOO LARGE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN AS WELL SO. THANK YOU I ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN THE. DOES THAT TBL DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNTS YEAH. SO THIS SUB DISASTER. A RESPONSE MERGED OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. IS IS GONNA BE LANGUAGE THE TRAILER BILL IT'S CHANGED THE. THE LANGUAGE IT IT IT SUNSETS THAT. REQUIREMENT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. AND ALLOWS. IT REALLY DESIGNED TO ALLOW ODDS AT A WE AS THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY. TO DEAL WITH. A DISASTER. PARTICULARLY OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT WE SAW. RECENTLY. IT ALLOWS US TO ACT QUICKLY WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE DECISIONS TO. BRING IN SPECIALIZED RESOURCES A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR SO THE EXAMPLE IS IS THAT DOWN. YOU KNOW WE. YOU KNOW WE WE IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES WE. WE HAD THE U. S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS BROUGHT IN TO HELP US MANAGE THE. MASSIVE PRE OPERATION LARGEST A PRE OPERATION REALLY. SINCE THE NINETEEN NO SIX EARTHQUAKE AND. YOU KNOW THEY ARE BROUGHT AND PRIVATE CONTRACTORS IN AND ALONG THE WAY THERE. THEIR PRIVATE CONTRACTORS AND THE U. S. GOVERNMENT GOT INTO A LABOR DISPUTE WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY HAVE SHUT DOWN DEBRIS CLARETT'S OPERATIONS FOR NINETY DAYS AT A MINIMUM. THEREBY PUSHING BACK OUR ABILITY TO GET THOSE COMMUNITIES CLEANED UP AND RECOVERING GETTING NEW BUILDING STARTED GETTING THE ECONOMY. RECOVERED. BY. BY HAVING THIS ABILITY WE WERE ABLE TO STEP IN. WITH THE STATE BRING IN STATE CONTRACTORS. RAPIDLY UP PUT IN PLACE UP A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DEBRIS CONTRACTING CONTRACT OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE UP THE DEBRIS REMOVAL. WE HAD AYE AYE SIMILAR ISSUES IN IN MONTECITO AT THE MUD FLOW IN IN A VENTURA COUNTY. THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE TO DIP INTO THIS. THIS EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. IT'S IT'S IT'S PART OF THAT. THAT. SPECIALIZE FIND. AND DIE IN ITS ONLY USED WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. WHAT THIS DOES IS IT JUST CLARIFIES IS CLARIFIES THAT THAT THE ALLOCATIONS FROM THE ACCOUNT? ARE FOR ACTIVITIES THAT COMMENCE WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS OF A PROCLAMATION RATHER THAN WHAT IT IS NOW THAT OCCUR AFTER HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF THE PROCLAMATION SO. EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNOR PROCLAIMED IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF THESE EVENTS. YOU KNOW. WE NEED WE WE HAD ALREADY COMMITTED SO MUCH TO THE NORTH. THAT WHEN WE HAD MONO SETO AND AND UP IN TARA. YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS ACCOUNT AND AND UTILIZE IT BEFORE THAT HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS WAS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AFTER THE GOVERNOR PROCLAIM. STATE OF EMERGENCY AND OUT IN SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES. SO THIS IS REALLY THIS IS REALLY A TRADE CRAFT ISSUE IT'S VERY NECESSARY FOR US TO BE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THE GREATEST FLEXIBILITY IN THE PIT IT ACCORDINGLY. OUGHT TO MANAGE THESE THESE VERY COMPLEX AND AND THAT CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THANK YOU PART FINANCE. AND FOR THE THE PURPOSE OF THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT OF THE TRIO AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT. IS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO STATE AGENCIES AND LOCALS IN THE ABOUT AMERICA OF A DISASTER. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT LEGISLATION OR ALLEGED AND SORRY NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE IS. DESIRED IF FOR THIS ONE I THINK WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF ON THE ONLY OBAMA KIND OF LANGUAGE. COULD BE. THANK YOU AWARE. SO WE DIDN'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS WITH REMOVING THE SUNSET ON THIS LANGUAGE. AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT VALUE OF PROVIDING IN SOME CASES IT SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN NECESSARY WHEN THESE ACTIVITIES. TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED ON HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH SWITCHING. THE LANGUAGE AS IS RECOMMENDED HER AS HIS PROPOSED FROM OCCURRED TO COMMENCE. AND THE REASON WHY WERE ABOVE THE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IS BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS THAT'S REPLACE THE TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS. AND THAT THESE ACTIVITIES DON'T EXTEND FOR YOUR REALLY EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE IF IT'S JUST. COMMENCE THEN PUT BEN THEY COULD POTENTIALLY I USE THESE FUNDS WHICH DON'T GO THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS. FOR FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. SO I THINK OUR RECOMMENDED APPROACH IS INSTEAD TO STICK WITH THE. COMMAND OR STICK WITH THE. OCCUR WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAY PERIOD BUT ALLOW FOR AN EXTENSION UPON AN ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WAY THEY COULD GET ADDITIONAL TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE KEPT INFORMED IF IT'S ADDITIONAL TIME IS NECESSARY. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. ANY COMMENTS. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. RIGHT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S ROOM TO WORK SOMETHING OUT HERE YEAH FOR BETTER FOR WORSE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE INVOLVED WELL I MEAN LOOK WE KEEP TRACK OF IT SO IF THERE'S A WAY. TO COME UP WITH WITH A STRUCTURE SO THAT. WE CAN DO OUR OVERSIGHT KEEP TRACK OF WHERE THESE EXPENSES ARE I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A RELUCTANCE TO HAVE. TO ME IT'S OPEN ENDED. WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO TO FOLLOW OUR PROCESS YEAH WE DON'T LIKE THERE'S YOU ALWAYS HAVE ROOM SO WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THEM OKAY. THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN. I MOVED ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS THE HOMELESS YOUTH AND EXPLOITATION PROGRAM. SO OF THIS PROGRAM. IS THE HOME OF HIS PROGRAM WHICH IS. BEEN FUNDED SINCE. THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES. PER THE WELFARE INSTITUTION CODE. AND UP. THERE'S REALLY FOUR CORE COUNTIES. PER THE STATURE IT. SANTA CLARA LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO. THESE PROJECTS THE PROJECTS IN THESE CORE COUNTIES ARE COMPETITIVELY SELECTED. ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO AND INCLUDE. AYE AYE NUMBER OF OF DIFFERENT ADVANCE THE BILL WILSON CENTER IN SANTA CLARA CHILDRENS HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES THE LACKEY ST YOU SAID IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN DIEGO YOU SERVICES. EDITION TO. THREE THREE OF THESE FOUR ARE PROJECTS RECENTLY COMPETITIVELY SELECTED TO RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER BY A NEW TEN MILLION DOLLAR HOME ISSUED AN EMERGENCY SERVICE HOUSING PROGRAM. AND. THIS PROPOSAL PROPOSES A MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH. A COMPETITIVE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. WITHIN THE FOUR CORE COUNTIES. TO FIND NEW PROJECTS THE HIGHEST SCORE PROPOSAL EACH COUNTY WOULD BE FUNDED AT A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LEVEL. FOR EIGHTEEN MONTH GRANT TOWARD PERFORMANCE PERIOD. OF PICKING UP NEW PROJECTS WOULD INCREASE THE SERVICES WITHIN THESE RESPECTIVE OUT COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU PART FINANCE SO KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL AND THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS OPPOSE ALL IN THE NEXT ISSUE ARE BOTH PART OF THE BROADER HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE OF THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FOR IN THE. IN THE MAY REVISION IN BOTH OF THESE ARE JUST ONE TIME. AUGMENTATIONS. THANK YOU AWARE. I SOMEONE WE DONE OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS WE NOTED THERE IS A LACK OF CERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THESE FUNDS WOULD BE PROPOSED TO BE SPENT. SENSE THEN THE RECEIPTS MITCHELL INFORMATION AS WAS OUTLINES BY THE DIRECTOR. REALLY. THE LEGISLATURE PUTTING ONE WITH US WHETHER THAT IS THE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF THESE FUNDS ON TO GO TO THIS THIS FOR SPECIFIC COUNTIES ARE WHETHER THEY PREFER A DIFFERENT APPROACH CERTAINLY IS PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS. ALSO JUST WANTED TO KNOW BOTH WITH THIS AND I'M THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL ON THAT THAT THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO FUNDED FREQUENTLY FROM FEDERAL FUNDS THE STATE HAS. ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS THAT DEPARTMENT. DOES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OF DISCRETION ALLOCATING THOSE FUNDS AYE SO ONE OF THE THINGS TO CONSIDER SURE OF THE LARGER CONTEXT. THIS IS IT JUST ABLE TO BE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND THERE ARE THOSE OTHER RESOURCES I'M SO AS YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT YOUR FOR YOUR. PREFERRED FUNDING LEVEL FOR THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. CERTAINLY WORTH RECOGNIZING THAT THEIR SUPPORT ALL FUNDS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU KNOWS THE PUBLIC. THEY. I CAN THERE IS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOU THREE REPRESENT A RUNAWAY AND HOMELESS YOUTH PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PERSON THAT I THINK THE PARTNER FINANCES ACTUALLY INCREASE THE PROPOSAL FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM AND I WOULD NOTE IT IS ONLY ONE MILLION AND IF IT IS ONLY ONE TIME. SO THE AMOUNT IMPACT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A LONG TERM IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING YOU HOMELESSNESS. AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING PUT INTO THE PROGRAM AND HAVE EXPANDED KINDA LIKE LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL WHERE IT WENT OUT. TO ADDITIONAL I'M SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TO INCLUDE HOUSING AND SERVICES. I'M AND THIRTY. BOARD. THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE STATE AND I KNOW THAT WOULD CUT IS LIMITED AMOUNT BUT I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY BE ADDRESSING THIS WE HAVE FIFTEEN THOUSAND IVE HUNDRED. UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS STATE AND THAT'S ABOUT TWELVE PERCENT OF THE ENTIRE HOMELESS YOUTH POPULATION AND MOST YOUTH EXPERIENCING. OUR MOST OF THE CHRONIC ADULTS HAVE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY WERE YOU BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AYE WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS CAN REALLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE IN THE LONG RUN AND SO WE'RE JUST OF THOSE COMING THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE FROM THE PUBLIC. SINGLE BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS. SO I THINK THIS ALSO TAILORS AND THERE'S THERE'S A PROPOSAL ALSO MOVING THROUGH FOR AN OFFICE OF HOMELESS YOUTH WITH HOPEFULLY A LOT MORE. RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM AND WE SEEM TO BE LIMPING AROUND THE EDGES SO I'M HOPING THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL WELL. HELP US WITH SOMETHING MUCH LARGER AND APPROPRIATE FOR DEALING WITH WITH THIS POPULATION. SO WE ARE GOING TO HOLD ISSUE NUMBER TWELVE OPEN AS WELL TAKE IT UNDER ADVISEMENT AND WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHELTERS IN SERVICES AND CARRY OUT. THIS IS SUB ARE A REQUEST FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS IT'S UP CAL YES ADMINISTERS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDE SHELTER AND SUPPORTERS SERVICES TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AND THEIR CHILDREN. OF THE PROGRAM HAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO SUB RECIPIENTS AND FUNDING IS ALLOCATED EQUALLY AMONG THOSE. SEVERI CYPRIAN'S. WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE GET IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVISORY COUNCIL THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. AND DIES VERY ACTIVE. GROUP. GRANT SUB AWARDS ARE WORDED NOT COMPETITIVELY. PER. I STATURE IT. WHICH WHICH CAN PROHIBITS NEW PROGRAMS FROM HAVING ACCESS TO STATE FUNDS. SO CALLOUS VALUES. INCREASE IN IN FUNDS IN FISCAL YEAR ELEVEN AND TWELVE. AYE TO OPEN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS AND ADDED FOUR ADDITIONAL SUB RECIPIENTS TO THE PROGRAM. I NOTICED NO NO SHELTERS HAVE BEEN ADDED SINCE THEN. OF THE NEW. TEN MILLION EIGHTY PERCENT. WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE EXISTING PROGRAM SUB RECIPIENTS AND TWENTY PERCENT. WILL BE ALLOCATED BY COMPETITIVE FUNDING FOR UP TO TEN ADDITIONAL SUB RECIPIENTS. SO EIGHTY PERCENT. TO THE EXISTING SUB RECIPIENTS THAT'S ROUGHLY A MILLION.

MAYBE VISION ADULT AND JUVENILE POPULATION ADJUSTMENT. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR WHINING COMMITTEE MEMBERS. JASON LOPEZ CDC ARE. SHOULD I GIVE IT JUST A MINUTE TO QUIET DOWN A LITTLE BETTER WE OKAY TO. WELL. WE'VE GOT SHIFTS OF FOLKS COMING IN. THOSE ARE MY FOLKS TO THE LATEST WAVE OF OKAY. I THINK THEIR THE DOORS CLOSING SO THANK YOU. OKAY. AS YOU MENTIONED FIRST ISSUE UP FOR CDC R. INVOLVES OUR POPULATION PROJECTIONS SO AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE BY NOW. TWICE YEARLY THE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH IS ASKED TO PROJECT WHAT OUR OFFENDER POPULATIONS ARE GOING TO BE. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. TYPICALLY THIS WILL ACCOMPANY THAT JAN TEN RELEASE OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET AND THEN YOU'LL SEE IT AGAIN HERE IN THE MAY REVISE. WITH OUR SPRING PROJECTIONS SO WITH ME TODAY IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR JULIE BASCO. OF THE DEPARTMENT'S OFFICE OF RESEARCH SHE'S GONNA WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT GOES INTO DEVELOPING THE NUMBERS THAT THEY PRODUCE AND THEN WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR. AS JASON INDICATED OUR. OFFICE PREPARES THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS TWICE A YEAR AND OUR CURRENT VERSION IS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SPRING POPULATION PROJECTION REPORT AND THAT RELEASED ALONGSIDE THE MAY REVISE. THIS CAR AROUND WE DID PROVIDE A HANDOUT SHEET THAT WILL COVER MANY OF THE NUMBERS THAT I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS MORNING. SO FIRST OF WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW IT ALL INSTITUTION POPULATION WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND. TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY OFFENDERS ON JUNE THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OUR PROJECTION FOR JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO OFFENDERS THIS IS A ONE YEAR DECREASE HAVE NEARLY THREE THOUSAND OFFENDERS OR TWO POINT ONE PERCENT. OUR REPORT PROJECTS ANNUAL INSTITUTION POPULATION GROWTH DECLINING IN THE NEXT TWO BUDGET CYCLES AND THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN'S ENHANCE CREDIT EARNING STRUCTURE. IN THESE ENHANCEMENTS BEGAN AFFECTING THE OFFENDER POPULATION LAST JUNE SO NOT QUITE A YEAR AGO. SO ADDITIONALLY OUR COURT COMMITMENTS ARE CURRENT AT A LOWER NUMBER THAN WE PROJECTED AND OUR FALL REPORT. AND THAT'S DRIVING THE INSTITUTION POPULATION LOWER THAN WE PROJECTED THAT. SO BY JUNE THIRTY TWENTY NINETEEN THE INSTITUTION POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED OFFENDERS LOWER THAN EXPECTED IN THE FALL. HIM BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY IT SHOULD BE ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED OFFENDERS LOWER. SO WHERE DOES THAT PUT THE STATE IN TWO YEARS JUNE TWENTY TWENTY. WITH AN ADULT INSTITUTION POPULATION PROJECTED AT A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN OFFENDERS. AND THAT WOULD RESULT THAT PROJECTION WILL RESULT IN A TWO YEAR DECREASE OF FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR OFFENDERS. MOVING ON TO PEARL PROJECTIONS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROJECTIONS ARE ALSO LOWERED THEM WE PRODUCED IN OUR FALL REPORT. THE LOWER PROJECTED INSTITUTION POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO RESOLVE IN LOWER RELEASES TO PEARL AND THERE BY A LOWER PAROLE POPULATION. BY JUNE THIRTY TWENTY NINETEEN THE PAROLE POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED PAROLEES LOWER THAN WE ANTICIPATED IN THE FALL. AND BY JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED PAROLEES LOWER. THE PEARL POPULATION WAS FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE ON JUNE THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OUR PROJECTION FOR JUNE THIRTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE. THIS IS A ONE YEAR INCREASE OF FIVE PERCENT. AND FROM HERE THE PAROLE PROJECTIONS INCREASE FURTHER IN THE NEXT FEW BUDGET CYCLES. JUNE TWENTY TWENTIES PEARL POPULATION PROJECTS AT FORTY NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY NINE. AND THAT'S A TWO YEAR INCREASE OF TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHT PAROLEES. FINALLY OUR YOUTH POPULATION. JUNE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION WAS SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR YOUTH. FOR JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR PROJECTION DECREASES SLIGHTLY TO A SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION. THEN AGAIN DRIVEN BY PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN JUVENILE COURT PROVISIONS WE PROJECT AN INCREASED AVERAGE DAILY POPULATION OF SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN YOU. FOR JUNE OF TWENTY NINETEEN. I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THROUGH. BUT ANY COMMENTS FROM OF FINANCE BELIAU. OKAY ANY MEMBER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. YOU'RE PROJECTING A USE INCREASE POPULATION YES WE ARE. AND THAT'S BASED ON. SO PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN HAD THE PROVISION TO ALLOW USED TO GO BACK TO A JUVENILE COURT FOR RECENT INSANE. AND THAT DID NOT OCCUR AS EARLY AS WE HAD ANTICIPATED THERE WAS SOME ISSUES WITH FORMER SUPREME PRODUCED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND SO OUR INITIAL EXPECTATION THAT WE WOULD SEE. AN INCREASE AT OUR DJJ FACILITIES BECAUSE OF YOUTH BEING REFERRED THROUGH THE JUVENILE COURT PROCESS DID NOT OCCUR AS EARLY AS WE EXPECTED SO THIS INCREASE NOW IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THOSE CASES CLEARING OUT OF THE COUNTY LEVEL. ALRIGHT FINE. OKAY. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE HOW MANY. PHONE. COMMENTS ALRIGHT FINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WITH ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN. HEPATITIS C..

WITHIN THE INSTITUTION POPULATION WHICH IS MUCH GREATER THAN THAT OUT IN THE PUBLIC. WE ALSO. ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND THIS WITH. OTHER CALIFORNIA AGENCIES. NOT NOT JUST WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT BUT DO SAGE AND. MEDICARE I'LL HAVE. ALSO INCREASED INITIATIVES.

ANY. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY A ANY MEMBER COMMENTS. OKAY FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT ITEM. NO THANK YOU. I ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN CONTRABAND INTERDICTION PROGRAM. YEAH. ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN. YES. OKAY I WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTS NINE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN BUDGET YEAR ANY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY TOOK EMPLOYMENT A TWO YEAR CONTRABAND INTERDICTION PILOT PROGRAM AND TO EXPAND OUR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. AT THE SUBSIDIES TREATMENT FACILITY LOCATED IN CORCORAN. THE CURRENT MAP PILOT PROGRAM IS OPERATING AT OUR CIW IN CIM INSTITUTIONS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES TO YOU CAN LIMON A TWO YEAR LIMIT TERM STAFFING FOR APPROXIMATELY FORTY BECAUSE CITY STAFF. TO ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND SIX HEALTH CARE STAFF. I'M JOINED THIS MORNING BY DEPUTY DIRECTOR CONNIE GIPSON OF OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND ABBAS CATHERINE TO BROCK WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM. THEY'RE GONNA PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK. GOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE DRUG USE OF CELL PHONES WITHIN OUR PRISONS CONTINUE TO BE OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IF CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DISCOVERED OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND CELLPHONES. OVER FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SIX POUNDS OF TOBACCO. OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND GRAMS METHAMPHETAMINE OVER TEN THOUSAND GRAMS OF HEROIN AND OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND GRAMS OF MARIJUANA. AND I TELL YOU WE DIDN'T GET IT ALL BECAUSE WE KNOW IN MAYES TODAY ARE STILL USING CELLPHONES TO CONDUCT CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. AS WELL AS IN MAYES CONTINUE TO OVERDOSE AND DIE BAHAI ILLEGAL DRUGS WITHIN OUR PRESENTS. AND CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY ELEVEN WE HAD NINE OVERDOSE DEATH. WITH FIVE HUNDRED AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEDICAL CONTACTS DUE TO SUSPECTED OVERDOSES. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD THIRTY EIGHT DEATHS DUE TO OVERDOSE. WITH SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEDICAL CONTACTS DUE TO A LOT SUSPECTED OVERDOSES. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IN A FOR DOING THE NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW WE'RE LOOKING AT TEN SUSPECTED OVERDOSE DEATHS WOULD NUMEROUS MEDICAL ENCOUNTERS THAT HAVE SAVED LIVES. THIS PROPOSAL OF CONTRABAND INTERDICTION PROGRAM UTILIZATION AT CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON. SUBSTANCE ABUSE FACILITY AT COURT GRANT. AIMS TO INTERDICT THE DRUGS COME INTO OUR PRESENCE THE CONTRABAND COMING IN BY UTILIZING A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OPERATION IN THE FRONT ENTRANCE AREAS. UTILIZING. MILLIMETER WAVE BODY SCANNERS BAGGAGE SCANNERS SO THAT EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO ENTERS OUR PRESENT FOR ANY LEGITIMATE REASON. WILL BE SNUBBED WILL BE SCREENED. ADDITIONALLY THE EXPANSION OF SIX CAME NINETEEN SO SUBSTANCE THAT HAVE WELL ALLOW FOR US TO DO VEHICLE SEARCHES. TO SEARCH OUR HEARTS PEOPLE SALLY POURS WILL WE KNOW CONTRABAND IS BEING SMUGGLED THROUGH WITH CIVILIANS. PUT PACKAGES UNDERNEATH THE CARRIAGE OF VEHICLES HOPING TO BE DRIVEN INTO OUR SECURE PERIMETER. I ASK FOR THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND I'LL DEFER TO MY PARTNER HERE. OKAY GOOD MORNING CATHERINE TO BROCK. STATEWIDE MENTAL HEALTH. DIRECTOR OF THE. AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE DRUG INTERDICTION STRATEGY DESCRIBE I MISS GIPSON IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPANION MATT PROGRAMS MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. I AS YOU KNOW WE IMPLEMENTED A PILOT MATH PROGRA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AT CIM AND CIW. AYE WE'RE NOW IN THE THIRD A YEAR OF THAT THREE YEAR PILOT WE'VE SUBMITTED TO OUR ANNUAL REPORTS TO THIS BODY. THIS PILOT SEEKS TO EMULATE. THE APPROACH IN THE CURRENT CA MNC AT W.. UP PILOTS YEAH AND REALIZING MORE HEAVILY ON OUR MEDICAL AND NURSING COUNTERPARTS TO HELP DELIVER THE CARE. UP THE REASON FOR THIS SHIFT IS BECAUSE IT IS MORE COST EFFICIENT AND IT LEVERAGES STAFF ALREADY ON SITE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE MATT PROGRAM IS MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN OPERATED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPLETE CARE MODEL. OP ED WHICH REQUIRES. PATIENT CARE TO BE VIEWED IN AND THE PATIENTS THEMSELVES TO BE YOU VIEWED AS A WHOLE PERSON. SO IT INTEGRATES INTER DISCIPLINARY DISCUSSIONS TO IMPROVE. MORE INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLANS AND IMPROVE OVERALL OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS. OF ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. LENNY CHAMADO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OUT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSALS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL PRISON STANDARDS SCREENING EVERYONE UPON ENTRY. AND ADDITIONALLY THE COSTS IN THIS ARE HIGHER THAN THE PROGRAM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN BECAUSE IT IS A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. I WAS SCREENING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. AND IT AIMS TO BRING THEM INTERDICT DRUGS AT ALL AVENUES AND CELLPHONE. I AM ADDITIONALLY. CDC OUR PLANS CHIU OUR WORK WITH A CONTRACTOR WANTS THEIR CHOSEN TO DETERMINE WHAT DATA IS AVAILABLE. AND DISCUSS WHAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO DO AN EFFECTIVE EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY AYE AYES MISTY BROCK SAID CIM IN CIW CURRENTLY HAVE A MAP PROGRAM SO. THIS PROGRAM WITH A COMBINATION OF MATT AND THE INTRODUCTION CAN BE COMPARED TO THAT TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. AND. CCR CAN USE THAT DATA OF WHERE THE DRUGS ARE FOUND AND HOW MUCH SHOULD I SYSTEM EVALUATION. WE HAVE THE COMES FROM. HELLO. CAITLYN O'NEILL AT THE LA AUTO WE RECOGNIZE THAT CONTRABAND IN PRISON IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN A PILOT APPROACH WITH AN EVALUATION COMPONENT. HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST IT APPEARS RELATIVELY COSTLY. STATE LAW AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THAT WE ESTIMATE THAT STATEWIDE EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM WOULD COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND REQUIRE HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO OPERATE. IT'S ALSO MORE THAN TEN TIMES AS EXPENSIVE ON A PER PERSON BASIS THAN THE EARLIER PILOT THAT I MISUSED ISHIMOTO REFERENCED. DOT AND NOT PILOT WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN CASES. SECOND THE PROGRAM DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL VALUATION EVEN IF RESEARCHERS ARE BROUGHT IN. WHEAT TO TO LOOK AT IT WE THINK THAT. IT WOULD BE CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO COME UP WITH A MEANINGFUL EVALUATION. BASED ON THIS IS BECAUSE THE OF THAT PROGRAM DOESN'T INCLUDE RANDOM DRUG TESTING OF INMATES WHICH WAS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE EARLIER EVALUATION. IT WOULD ONLY TEST WHETHER THE ENTIRE PACKAGE OF INTERVENTIONS WAS EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING IN MADE DRUG USE AND OTHER THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO FAX SUCH AS VIOLENCE. THE. THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATES THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT TRACKING THE NUMBER OF DRUG FINES. MADE THE OF VARIOUS INTERVENTIONS WOULD ALLOW IT TO CONCLUDE WHICH INTERVENTIONIST FIVE MOST EFFECTIVE HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE CONCERN. CONCERNS THERE FROM EVALUATION PERSPECTIVE THAT IF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. REDUCE INMATE DRUG USE REDUCE VIOLENCE EXCITER WE SHOULD BE TRACKING THOSE METRICS NOT SIMPLY HOW MANY DRUGS WERE FINDING. FOR EXAMPLE IT COULD BE THAT. IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASE INTERDICTION EFFORTS THE SMUGGLERS SIMPLY STEPPED UP THERE TRAFFICKING EFFORTS SENDING MORE DRUGS THROUGH. THE ADMINISTRATION CATCHES MORE THINKING THAT IT'S EFFECTIVE BUT THE SAME AMOUNT ULTIMATELY GETS THROUGH. THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE PROGRAM ONLY INCLUDES ONE INSTITUTION SO WOULD BE HARD TO KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IF IMPLEMENTED ELSEWHERE. FINALLY. WEKNOW THAT IFTHE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN PURSUING A PILOT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IT. DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH THE RESEARCHER TO DIVINE TO DESIGN A PILOT THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE MEANINGFUL EVALUATION AND. COME BACK POTENTIALLY IN JANUARY WITH ANOTHER PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD RESPOND TO THE LA DOES CONCERN IN REGARDS TO AVAILABLE DATA THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN MAINTAINED AS RELATES TO CONTRABAND INTERDICTION. WE'VE ESTABLISHED A SUREPOINT SITE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT MAINTAINS SEVERAL AREAS OF DATA THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE THAT IN WORKING WITH THE RESEARCHER WHO MAY BE CONTRACTED. IDENTIFYING THAT DATA SOURCE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AND THEY WORK WITH THEM TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER KEY ELEMENTS THAT THEY BELIEVE WILL BE BENEFICIAL. SO THAT THIS. RESEARCH OF THIS PILOT COULD BE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE. AND SO WE DO HAVE DATA SHAREPOINT. DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH AT TO EVALUATE. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. MEMBER COMMENTS. OKAY FINE ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THATITEM WILL BE HELD OPEN WOULD NOT IT ITEM NUMBER. SEVENTEEN WHICH IS OVER TIME BASED JUST. BUDGET ADJUSTMENT. OKAY WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST SIXTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO ADJUST THE DEPARTMENT BASS ADVERTISE AND FINDING. THIS IS DESIGNED TO SET THAT FUNDING LEVEL. CONSISTENT WITH SO. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THE LAST TIME THE DEPARTMENTS OVER TIME FUNDING WAS ADJUSTED. SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF. SALARY INCREASES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EMPLOYEE COM. ANNUAL EXERCISE AND THAT EXERCISE HAS NOT HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR INCREASES. TO OVERTIME RATES WHICH OBVIOUSLY ACCOMPANIED SALARY INCREASES THIS REQUEST IS JUST TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE INCREASES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN I'M WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT GOING FORWARD. WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ACCOUNT FOR THOSE INCREASES ALONG WITH ANY SALARY INCREASES THAT OCCUR THROUGH THE EMPLOYEE COMPACTS ARE SIZE. ANY COMMENT. FINANCE BELIAU. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE TEXAS ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN. HE TWO EXCUSE ME WHICH IS TRAINING INITIATIVES. OKAY. WITH THIS PROPOSAL CDC OUR REQUEST TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND FIVE POSITIONS TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE NINETEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING STARTING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ADD TRAINING FOR THEIR APARTMENTS PEACE OFFICER IN SUPERVISORY POSITIONS. THIS PROPOSAL INVOLVES ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO ATTEND OUR BASIC CORRECTIONAL OFFICER ACADEMY OUR OFFICE TRAINING FOR A BECAUSE CITY STAFF ARE ANNUAL SUPERVISORY AND MANAGERIAL TRAININGS I COMMAND COLLEGE FOR OUR CUSTODY LEADERS. AND A BASIC AND SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATOR TRAINING FOR OUR SPECIAL AGENT AND OUR INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT STAFF. THE FIVE POSITIONS REQUESTED WILL ALLOW THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INVESTIGATIVE TRAINING UNIT WITHIN OUR OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THIS UNIT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT AND ADMINISTRATION OF OUR STATEWIDE SPECIAL AGENT AND I S. YOU STAFF TRAINING. I'M JOINED THIS MORNING BY ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR STACY LOPEZ OF OUR PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT A SHE'S GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSAL AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS DIRECTOR LOOK THE STATE I'M CC LOPEZ I'M ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR WITH THE PEACE OFFICER SELECTION AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT. DIRECTOR LOOK IS COVERED MANY OF THE. ASKED WITH OUR PROPOSAL I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRAINING THAT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. FIRST WE HAVE THE BUT EXTRA WEEK FOR THE BASIC CRUX OFFICER ACADEMY FOR OUR CADETS GOING OUT INTO THE INSTITUTIONS. AND THE TRAINING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDING IS IMPLICIT BIAS EMPLOYEES WALDRON REHABILITATION LEADERSHIP TEAM BUILDING AND ALSO ADDING SOME ADDITIONAL CADET ON SITE TRAINING VISITS. A pDURING THOSE TWELVE WEEKS GIVES CADETS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A PRISON. THE INSIDE A PRISON BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY GO OUT AND WORK AND ONE. WITH REGARDS TO THE OFFICE TRAINING WERE ADDING EIGHT OUT WE LOOKED OUT EIGHT HOURS TO OUR FORTY HOURS CUDGEL. AND AGAIN WE WOULD HAVE BE THREADING SIMILAR TOPICS SUCH AS WHAT I JUST MENTIONED OF IMPLICIT BIAS ETHICAL DECISION MAKING AND TRUST. EMPLOYEES ROLE IN REHABILITATION AND ALSO STRESS RESILIENCY AND WELLNESS A TRAINING FOR OUR STAFF IN THE FIELD. TAKING THAT. TO THE SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS WE ARE REQUESTING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL WEEK TO OUR. MANAGEMENT TRAINING AND CURRENTLY IT'S IT OUT EIGHTY HOURS FOR ALL FIRST AND SECOND LINE SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS AND WE'RE LOOKING TO. OUT ANOTHER IN A WEEK. ADDITIONAL WEEK TO THAT WITH AGAIN SIMILAR TOPICS THAT WE WOULD BE TRAINING THE CADETS THE LINE STAFF AND THEN TAKING IT TO THE SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS. IN ADDITION TO. MORE LEADERSHIP AND MANAGERIAL TRAINING FOR OUR SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS. AS I MENTIONED ALL THE ABOVE TOPICS WILL BE THREADED THROUGH THE TRAINING SO WE'RE HITTING ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES STARTING WITH THE CADETS. AND THEN MOVING FORWARD UP TO THE SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS AS IT WAS MENTIONED ISTHE COMMAND COLLEGE. WE WOULD LIKE TO. CONTRACT WITH THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND THIS WOULD BE A TRAINING THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO OUR CORRECTIONAL CAPTAINS. AND ABOVE AND IT'S A FOURTEEN TO SIXTEEN MONTH PROGRAM NOT ALL AT ONE TIME. THE WHERE THEY GET TO GO TO LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND INTERACT WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT. LEADERS WITHIN THE STATE. AND LASTLY WE'RE ASKING. AS PART OF OUR PROPOSAL TO OF FUND US OF INVESTIGATOR TRAINING FOR OUR INSTITUTION SERVICES UNITS WHICH WOULD ENTAIL OUR CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS ARE SERGEANTS AND OUR LIEUTENANTS. TO GO THROUGH BASIC INVESTIGATOR TRAINING AND THEN SOME ADVANCED. INVESTIGATOR TRAINING FOR OUR SPECIAL AGENTS THAT WORK FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND CORRECTIONAL SAFETY. THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR ALL OF THIS WOULD NOT BEGIN JULY FIRST WE'RE LOOKING AT AND FACES THE ACADEMY PIECE WOULD START IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IF THIS IS APPROVED. AND THE FIELD TRAINING AND THE SUPERVISORY TRAINING WOULD BEGIN IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN M. NEXT FISCAL YEAR. AS WELL AS THE INVESTIGATOR TRAINING. I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. ANY COMMENTS FINANCE. WENDY SHERMAN A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. EXPANSION OF THE ACADEMY OFFICE TRAINING AND ADVANCED MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL ASSUMES A JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINE IMPLEMENTATION SO THIS WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT. A LITTLE OVER SIX MONTHS TO DEVELOP ANY NEED TRAINING AS NECESSARY BUT ALSO THEY HAVE EXISTING TREE NEW TRAINING WHICH COULD BE IMPLEMENTED. I ADDITIONALLY CVC ARE RE EVALUATES THEIR TRAINING ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE IF ANY TRAINING SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AND NEW ONE SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. LA DON'T. WE DON'T RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND INVESTIGATOR TRAINING. AND AND WE KNOWLEDGE AT THE REMAINING TERM TRAINING THAT'S PROPOSED COULD ADDRESS REAL CHALLENGES FACED BY THE DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER WE'VE FOUND THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION WITH WHICH TRICKS THAT FAST WEATHER. DOT REMAINING PROPOSED TRAINING WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES. FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT CURRICULAR TRAINING MATERIAL WOULD BE USED WHETHER THE PROPOSED TRAINING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY ELSEWHERE AND WHY THE ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT IT WOULD BE. SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING CHALLENGES HERE. ROOM. FURTHERMORE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER. SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL TRAININGS COULD BE OFFERED IN LIEU OF EXISTING TRAININGS FOR EXAMPLE. AND THEY DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY OFFERS FORTY HOURS A YEAR TO ALL STAFF AT PRISONS OF TRAINING. PERHAPS SOME OF THESE AND THESE PROPOSED A THE PROPOSED EIGHT HOURS OF ADDITIONAL ANNUAL TRAINING COULD BE FOLDED INTO THAT EIGHTY HOURS SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF A PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT IF WERE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE A COULD. REVIEW THOSE EXISTING TRAININGS AND ASSESS WHETHER WANTED TO SUBSTITUTE THE NEW ONES AND. ANY COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY FINE LOOK THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT I DON'T TO WILL BE HELD OPEN. OF THE CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR ó ONE. RACIAL ADJUSTMENT. OKAY WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND IN AN EFFORT TO ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF REHABILITATION AND PROGRAM ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO OUR OFFENDER POPULATION. CITY SEE OUR REQUEST THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND EIGHTY NINE POINT TWO CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR ONE POSITIONS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. CURRENTLY THIS CLASSIFICATION IS ADJUSTED TWICE YEARLY AS PART OF THE POPULATION PROCESS. THAT RATIO IS CURRENTLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OFFENDERS TO EVERYONE COUNSELOR THIS PROPOSAL INVOLVES CHANGING THAT RATIO TO. ONE COUNSELOR FOR EVERY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE OFFENDERS I'M JOINED BY JENNIFER BRETT WHO IS OUR. ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITHIN OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS SHE'S GOING TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THE PROPOSAL AND THEN WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE CURRENT COUNSELOR TO OFFENDER RATIO OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO ONE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR AN IN DEPTH ONE ON ONE INTERACTION WITH THE INMATES ON THEIR CASELOAD. THE RATIOS REMAIN THE SAME FOR DECADES DESPITE NUMEROUS CHANGES IN AND WORKLOAD INCREASES IN WORKLOAD OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. CANCERS HAVE DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THE INMATES ON THEIR CASELOADS. HOWEVER WITH THE CURRENT RATIO WORKLOAD REQUIREMENTS THERE SIMPLY ISN'T TIME TO SPEND WITH THEM DEVISING THEIR INDIVIDUAL STRATEGY FOR THE REHABILITATION REENTRY. ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS WITH REDUCED CASELOADS BY MAKING THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE WAY WE'RE BUDGETED ON THE RATIO. OF STAFF TO A FENDER. WOULD ALLOW THEM TO SPEND TIME MATCHING INMATES TO THE VIABLE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM SUITED FOR THEM. THIS WILL IMPROVE THE OVER OVERALL WRAPAROUND APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKEN. WITH INDIVIDUAL REHABILITATIVE NEEDS. IT WILL ENABLE THE COUNSELORS TO ADVOCATE AND SERVE MORE AS A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR TYPE ROLE TO THE INMATES. HELPING THEM FROM THE TIME THAT THEY COME IN. TO INCARCERATION AND TELL THE TIME THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT PAROLA RELEASE TO MAP THEIR PLAN AND STRATEGY. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE. COUNSELORS IF THEY HAD LESS ON THEIR CASELOAD COULD ASSIST IN INMATE WHO INDICATES THEY'D LIKE TO IMPROVE THEIR PARENTAL RELATIONSHIP. BY POINTING THEM TO EXISTING SELF HELP PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL OVERALL BENEFIT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE AND ME ENSURING SUCCESSFUL REHABILITATION REENTRY. I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TODAY. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS IN FINANCE. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT. TO PROVIDE MORE COUNSELING TO THE INMATES THERE THE ONE THE KEY CC ONES ARE THE ONES WHO KNOW THE INMATES THE BASS AND THEN IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO ENGAGE MORE WITH THE INMATES TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. AND REALLY PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THAT. LEóN. WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DIDN'T DEMONSTRATE THE NEED TO REDUCE COUNSELOR CASELOADS. IT'S ARGUED THAT WORKLOAD FOR COUNSELORS HAD GONE UP BY HASN'T MADE IT MADE IT CLEAR WHAT PROBLEM THAT HAS CREATED. I. FURTHERMORE IT'S UNCLEAR Y. COUNSELORS NEED MORE TIME TO IDENTIFY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR INMATES IN OTHER WORDS WHAT WHAT IS THE REASON THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT SUFFICIENTLY ABLE TO DO THIS. FURTHERMORE IT'S UNCLEAR Y. COUNSELORS NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME HELPING INMATES PLANNED FOR RELEASE WHEN CDC ARE ALREADY HAD STAFF WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO NOT PROVIDED EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT MORE ONE ON ONE TIME IS NEEDED BETWEEN COUNCILLORS AND INMATES FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE INDICATED THAT. INMATES ARE CURRENTLY BEING TURNED AWAY FROM REQUESTING TO MEET WITH COUNSELORS DUE TO LACK OF CANCERS AVAILABILITY. OKAY ANY COMMENTS FROM. THE AUDIENCE. ANY MEMBERS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE NEED. YES COUNSELORS AS I INDICATED WITH OUR WORKLOAD. IT'S BECOME MORE OF A ROLE OF ASSIGNING INMATES TO THAT JOB ASSIGNMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. HOUSING THEM IN FOLLOWING THE BASIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES OF THEIR JOB. AND IT IS IT'S MOVED FROM PREVIOUSLY THEY WOULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME AS COUNSELORS GUIDING THE INMATES. HELPING THEM IN ASSISTING THEM IN AND JOBS BETTER SUITED FOR THE SKILLS THEY HAVE OR SKILLS THAT WILL HELP THEM WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED. WHILE WE HAVE A ROBUST PROGRAM TO HELP AT THE TAIL END OF INCARCERATION AND HELPING THEM TO TRANSITION. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROCESS IS INTERWOVEN THROUGH THEIR ENTIRE INCARCERATION. COUNSELORS KNOW THEIR INMATES PASSED THEY WORK WITH HIM EVERYDAY UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SPEND WITH THEM INDIVIDUALLY TO HELP GUIDE THEM ON THAT PATH THROUGH THEIR INCARCERATION. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. THAT BRINGS US TO A I'D MET AT I WILL ALSO BE HELD OPEN THAT BRINGS US TO. ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN EXCUSE ME TWENTY. ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY WHICH IS THE MEDICAL GUARDING AND TRANSPORTATION. OKAY WITH THE MEDICAL GUARDING AND TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL CCR REQUESTS FIVE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN FORTY TWO POINT SEVEN CORRECTIONAL OFFICER POSITIONS ON GOING STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TO AUGMENT OUR THIRD WATCH MADE GUARDIAN TRANSPORTATION STAFFING. THESE RESOURCES ARE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT JUST CONDUCTED OVER. SEVERAL MONTHS FROM MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THROUGH FEBRUARY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THEY NEED IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS ASSESSMENT SUPPORTS THIRTY FIVE FIVE DAY POSTS. WHEN APPLYING THE REALLY FACTOR TO THAT THIRTY FIVE NUMBER YOU THEN GET TO THE FORTY TWO POINT SEVEN THAT YOU SEE IN THE B. C. P.. I'MJOINED AGAIN BY MISS BARRETTO FROM OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS SHE'S GONNA TELL YOU ALL BUT MORE ABOUT AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BEAST BECAUSE THESE POSITIONS WILL. ASSIST US IN REDUCING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT UNSCHEDULED EMERGENCY TRANSPORTS HAVE. ON IN ME. PROGRAMS. UP THIRD WATCH TO CLARIFY THOSE OR SHIPS THAT TYPICALLY OCCUR AT TWO PM TO TEN PM AT NIGHT SO WELL AFTER OUR MEDICAL PERSONNEL HAVE PERFORMED THEIR. NORMAL DUTIES AND A REGULAR HEALTH CARE APPOINTMENTS UNSCHEDULED MEDICAL TRANSPORTS ARE MORE OF AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE THERE IS TREATMENT SERVICES REQUIRED IN THE COMMUNITY. NORMALLY AN EMERGENCY ROOM. THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED A STEADY AND CONTINUOUS INCREASE AN UNSCHEDULED MEDICAL TRANSPORTS AND THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THE DEPARTMENTS EXPERIENCED A FORTY SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE ON UNSCHEDULED EMERGENCY TRANSPORTS. NGUYEN UNSCHEDULED TRANSPORTS OCCUR ON THIRD WATCH. WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS ONE IS TO HIRE OVERTIME OR THE OTHER WHEN IT OCCURS MID SHIFT AND STAFF FROM THE PRIOR SHIFTER NO LONGER AVAILABLE. IT RESULTS IN US REDIRECTING EXISTING PASSED THE STAFF FROM THEIR CURRENT FUNCTION OUT TO DO THE TRANSPORT. WHEN THAT OCCURS IT OFTEN RESULTS IN IN MAY PROGRAM DISRUPTIONS. MODIFICATIONS ARE CLOSURES DUE TO THE REDUCED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE BECAUSE SEE STAFF. THIS HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON THE INMATE POPULATION IN THEIR ABILITY TURN CREDITS AND ENHANCEMENTS AND REHABILITATIVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS. AND ALSO BASIC RECREATION LIKE YARD INTO A ROOM. THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES AN IMMEDIATE AND NATIONAL SOLUTION. IT PROVIDES FOR CONSISTENT DEDICATED RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS REGULAR ONGOING NEED. BASED ON THE TRENDS OF UNSCHEDULED THIRD WATCH MEDICAL TRANSPORTS. THESE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WELL EIGHT OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON IN ME PROGRAMS AS A RESULT OF THE AND SCHEDULE TRANSPORTS. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TODAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE THE LAYOFF. WE DON'T RAISE ANY CONCERNS ON THIS PROPOSAL WE JUST NOTE THAT THAT DEPARTMENT IS CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF MEDICAL GUARDING AND TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTED TO PROVIDE IT WITH THE RESULTS OF THAT EVALUATION WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE SO THAT. IT MAY ASSESS REMEMBER CONVERSATION QUESTION. THANK YOU THAT I WILL ALSO BE HELD OPEN WE AT ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS A HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR RE ENTRY. OKAY. ON THE HEELS OF A DECISION BY THE FEDERAL CENTERS FOR MEDICARE MEDICAID SERVICES THAT CDC OURS DID NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL BENEFITS. THE DEPARTMENT IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH THAT THAT THE OFFENDER COULD EXPECT IF THEY WERE IN ONE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. REQUEST TEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OR. THIRD PARTY VENDORS TO PROVIDE HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR THOSE OFFENDERS HOUSE IN OUR REENTRY FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THE APPROACH PROPOSED IN THE BCP ALLOWS FOR A PREDICTABLE COST STRUCTURE. RATHER THAN THE UNCERTAINTY THAT ACCOMPANIES A FEE FOR SERVICE TYPE ARRANGEMENT. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT PROVIDES A CONSISTENT CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR OUR PARTICIPANTS WHICH WE THINK IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AYE WE BELIEVE RECEIVING A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF SERVICE FROM A FAMILIAR PROVIDER ORGANIZATION INCREASES THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS FOR OFFENDERS ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED. CDC ARE CURRENTLY HAS CAPACITY WITHIN OUR REENTRY FACILITIES OF ABOUT A THOUSAND. THAT INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY. WITHIN ARE FEMALE C. C. T. R. P. PROGRAM. CUSTODY COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAM AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY BEDS WITHIN OUR. MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM WITHIN OUR DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS I'M SPEAKING OF WHICH I AM JOINT FOR THIS ISSUE BY. KAREN CRETAN FROM HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AMY MILLER FROM OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE CCT R. P. FEMALE PROGRAM AND RYAN SOUSA WHO IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITHIN OUR DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. DRP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSIGHT OF OUR MAIL COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THE PROPOSAL AND THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OVERVIEW OF WHAT LED US BACK TO. WHERE WE ARE TODAY WE COULDN'T MORNING ALMOST GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN TRAINING WITH THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES I JUST WANTED TO? REITERATE THE IMPACT OF. WHAT LED US HERE AND? S. ID DIRECTOR LOPEZ SAID THERE'S MORE THAN A THOUSAND PATIENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THAT HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES WITHOUT COVERAGE OR CARE. ALMOST OVERNIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S THE IMMEDIACY OF THIS. OF THIS PROPOSAL. AND JUST TO REITERATE LITERATURE LOPEZ SAID THE PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE COVERAGE AS WELL AS PREDICTABILITY OF COST FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AMY MILLER ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR FOR FEMALE OFFENDER PROGRAM SO I OVERSEE THE C. C. TRP PROGRAMS AS OUR FEMALE REENTRY BETS. OBVIOUSLY THESE RANCHER PROGRAMS ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO THE WOMEN. GOING BACK OUT INTO OUR COMMUNITIES THEY OFFER A EXTENSIVE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THEY OFFER ADDITIONAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO GO TO COLLEGE AT THE COLLEGES NEARBY. AND THEY ALSO OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE WOMEN TO ACTUALLY GO AND GET A JOB AND BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED BUILT THEIR JOB SKILLS SAVE MONEY. BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT MONEY AVAILABLE AS THEY RELEASE IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD AND SET UP THEIR LIVES AND GET STARTED AGAIN. WITH. THE ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS WHICH IS PART OF WHAT THESE ARE WE ARE AS AN AGENCY FOR I CC ARE MANDATED TO PROVIDE FOR THAT HEALTH CARE FOR THE POPULATION THAT IS OUT THERE. THAT'S PART OF THE PENAL CODE SECTION EYES SO. I WE HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL NEEDS EVEN FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION. THE PENAL CODE GOES ON TO STATE THAT EXISTING PSYCHIATRIC OR MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE ONGOING CARE IS NOT A BASIS FOR EXCLUDING. THOSE PROTESTS BENSON A MATTER WHAT WE HAVE THOSE MEN AND WOMEN THEY'RE GOING OUT THERE TO THOSE PROGRAMS. TO THE RE ENTRIES AND. SO HAVING THIS SET MEDICAL PROGRAM IN PLACE IS REALLY CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT CONTINUITY OF CARE. THANK YOU. BECOMING SOME FINANCE. RICHMOND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST WANNA KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS MERELY A STOP GAP TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE NO LONGER ARE. WHO ARE IN A REENTRY PROGRAMS WE DON'T SEE IT AS A SINGLE SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD? THIS PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS THROUGH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. YOU THE PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THE PROVIDING A LEVEL OF SERVICE COMPATIBLE TO WHAT INMATES HAD WHEN THEY WERE IN PRISON. AND THERE'S ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT INMATES WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE SAME PROVIDERS UPON RELEASE. AND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JONATHAN PETERSON AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THESE REENTRY FACILITIES ON A CONTRACT BASIS. AND INSTEAD DIRECT THE CDC ARE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AT REENTRY FACILITIES ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS AS THEY'VE BEEN DOING SINCE THE DECISION FROM. THE CENTER FOR A MEDICARE SERVICES CAME DOWN AND. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS WOULD ALLOW MORE DETAILED PROPOSAL TO BE DEVELOPED FOR AYE JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN. AND GIVE THE DEPARTMENT MORE TIME TO CLARIFY HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO PROVIDE SERVICES THROUGH THIS CONTRACTED MODEL. VERSES ON A FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL IN THAT WHICH THEY'VE BEEN USING FOR A COUPLE MONTHS A SENSE THE DECISION. AND THAT WOULD ALSO ALLOW AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS TO PROVIDING THIS CARE IN THESE FACILITIES. OKAY. ANY OMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. MEMBERS. OKAY FINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER TWENTY TWO. CASE RECORD TRAINING TING OKAY WITH OUR CASE RECORDS TRAINING TEAM PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTS FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THREE CASE RECORDS ADMINISTRATOR POSITIONS.

I'M JOINED AGAIN BY MISS BARRETTO FROM OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS WHO'S GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. CASE RECORD STAFF ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING INMATES CREDIT EARNING RATE USED TO CALCULATE AN INMATE'S REALLY STATE. SUCH CALCULATIONS WERE BASED ON A VAST ARRAY OF SENTENCING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. CASE RECORD STAFF MUST ENSURE ACCURATE INTERPRETATION AND CALCULATION OF AN INMATE'S RELEASE DATE OR BOARD OF PAROLE HEARING DATE. EXCEEDINGLY COMPLICATED SENTENCING CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES. ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE FREQUENT. AS A RESULT OF ONGOING FREQUENT CHANGES DUE TO NEW CASE LAW COURT RULES PROGRAMS AND LEGISLATIVE MANDATES. IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR CASE RECORD STAFF TO HAVE THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF ALL STATUTES REGULATIONS POLICIES BOTH PAST AND CURRENT. TO ENSURE AN INMATE'S SENTENCES RECORDED ACCURATELY THROUGHOUT INCARCERATION. SAP MUST BE TRAINED APPROPRIATELY TO ENSURE RELEASE STATES HAVE BEEN COMPUTED PURSUANT TO EACH LAW. AND TO THE SPECIFICS OF AN INMATE'S TERM. USING A REGIONAL APPROACH THESE THREE POSITIONS PROVIDE TRAINING TO CASE RECORDS OFFICES IN THE REGION. ALLOWING FOR BOTH CLASSROOM ENSURE SIDE HANDS ON TRAINING TO ALL STAFF. AN URGENT CHANGING LAWS MANDATES ARE PROGRAMS AS THEY OCCUR WHICH THEY FREQUENTLY DO. THESE STAFF WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY ON THE SPOT INFORMATION AND TRAINING TO THE INSTITUTION CASE RECORD STAFF IMMEDIATELY.

JOHN MARSHALL HERE FROM OUR BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FIND ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE ILLEGAL. OKAY UNEASILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVES THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY WE DO RECOMMEND PROVIDING THE RESOURCES ON A THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS. AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS RECOMMENDATION IS THIS RESPONSIBILITY IS NEW. FOR DOJ AND SAID THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AND THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED HOW LONG THEY COULD TAKE WHAT TYPES OF RESOURCES WOULD POTENTIALLY BE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE. FOR THE STATE SO IN LINE WITH THAT WE ALSO DO RECOMMEND REQUIRING DOJ SUBMIT A REPORT. BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON VARIOUS OUTCOME MEASURES SUCH AS THE ONES THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT. NUMBER OF CASES AND THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE CASES TO THAT PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH INFORMATION DETERMINE WHAT LEVEL OF ONGOING RESOURCES IS NEEDED GOING FORWARD. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE. AUDIENCE MEMBERS. OKAY THANK YOU I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT YEAH WE'RE COMIN. JUST A PROGRAM IN GENERAL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM IS IDENTIFIED A GAP WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OTHER SOME GOOD WORK BEING DONE BY THE FEDERAL AGENCIES AND SOME SOME LOWER LEVEL WORK BEING DONE BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE'S THIS HUGE GAP IN THE MIDDLE. SPY AS FAR CYBER CRIME. WORK. I WAS AT A NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND AND. WORKING WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER STATES ARE FAR AHEAD OF US AS FAR AS OUR WORK IN THE CYBER AREA WHICH IS. ALMOST SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING BECAUSE WE ARE THE TECH COMPANY. OR TEXT STATE OF THE OF THE NATION. SO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IDENTIFIED THIS HUGE GAP IN. JUST SOME OF THE AREAS LIKE THE DREAM MARKET OF JUST SOME TERMS THAT THAT ARE OUT THERE THE. TOWER SERVER THE ONION AND THESE ARE ALL. AREAS THAT. PEOPLE ARE WORKING ILLEGALLY AND AND THE DREAM MARKET IS KIND OF DESCRIBE THIS THAT EBAY. OF FOR CRIMINALS YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT ON THE STARK WEB ANYTHING THAT'S ILLEGAL THAT YOU CAN'T BUY LEGAL YOU CAN GET THERE FROM DRUGS TO. PEOPLE TO ANY TYPE OF THE LEGAL SERVICES IN A MURDER FOR HIRE AND WERE NOT WORKING IN THAT AREA AND NOBODY IN A STATEWIDE EFFORT IS WORKING IN THAT AREA. AND IT'S A IT'S A HUGE GAP IN IT SO THAT IT'S AN AREA OF CONCERN. AND SO POSSESS SOME TERMS BUT I WANTED TO JUST TOUCH ON ON LIMITED TERM FUNDING AND FOR DOJ. THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT. THERE'S BEEN SOME OTHER PROGRAMS THAT. HAVE HAD LINEN LIMITED TERM FUNDING ATTACHED TO IT AND JUST THE STATE PROCESSFOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HIRE. RIGHT NOW FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE DOJ WE USUALLY HIRE EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS AND WHEN YOU PUT A LIMITED TERM FUNDING ATTACHED TO THAT. I'M TRYING TO GET LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM FROM OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA TO COME WORK FOR DOJ BUT I CAN ONLY PROMISE THEM THREE YEAR FUNDING IN AND YOU CAN IMAGINE. THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR AN ESTABLISHED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT HOUSE STABLE. A STABLE JOB TO SAY HEY I WANT TO GO DO THAT FOR A THREE YEAR PERIOD BECAUSE THAT'S ALL I CAN COMMIT TO THEM. SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TO HIRE THE THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK. FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SO I JUST I I THOUGHT WE WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO MENTION THAT AND WHEN YOU HIRE THESE TYPES OF PEOPLE THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE TO IT AND. JUST GIVING IDEA TAKES ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS THE HIGHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND THEN TO GET INTO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK YOU NEED SPECIALTY TRAINING AND THAT'S ANOTHER SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS SO WE'RE TALKING TWO YEARS BEFORE WE GET. YOU KNOW ESTABLISHED AND REALLY START DOING WORK IN THIS AREA SO. I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THANK YOU. I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS THAT PASSED WITH LIMITED TERM EMPLOYMENT. AND PEOPLE MUSTANG SO OKAY WILL LOOK INTO THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS. MEMBERS. OKAY THAT BRINGS THEM TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH BELIEVE THAT ITEM HOPE THAT BRINGS US TO AYE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN. WHICH IS SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. CHAPTER FIVE FORTY ONE STATUES OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THEN THEY MANAGER CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AGAIN AND THIS IS THE. REQUEST TO IMPLEMENT. SP THREE OR AS YOU MENTIONED. THIS TEN MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST I REPRESENTS THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT AND A TWENTY FIVE POSITIONS. I HAVE LINDA I HEAR FROM THE PROGRAM TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. A COME INTO FINANCE PEMBA CHEN WORTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT. CURRENTLY IN THE. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY EVEN WORKING TOGETHER ON THE POWER PROCESS FOR. SB THREE EIGHTY FOUR. THERE I THINK RIGHT NOW PROJECTING TO BE DONE AND COMPLETED WITH POWELL BY JANUARY AND SO THIS PROPOSAL IS ONLY FOR ONE YEAR FUNDING THE PLAN WOULD BE IN THE BCP THAT'S HAVE BEEN A NEXT YEAR. WILL INCLUDE A PLAN FOR ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION NOT ONLY OF OF THE TECHNOLOGY PORTION BUT ALSO ALSO FOR THE PROGRAM IN GENERAL. AND THEN WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS ON IMPLEMENTATION DURING HEARINGS NEXT YEAR IT FRONT THANK YOU INCUMBENTS MELLOW. WE DON'T HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THE REQUESTED FUNDING BECAUSE IT IS FOR THE FIRST YEAR BUT BECAUSE IT IS FOR THE FIRST YEAR WE HAVE KIND OF BROADER RECOMMENDATIONS. TO HELP THE LEGISLATURE MONITOR. THIS SIDE NEW KIND OF IT PROJECT INNER AND THE PROJECTED COST CURRENTLY AS SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS. AND SO WE HAVE REPORTED RECOMMENDATIONS INTO ASPECTS. THE FIRST IS WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND. THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THAT DOJ SUBMIT A REPORT OUTLINING ITS FULL PLAN FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REGISTRY. THE STEPS THAT PLANS TO TAKE HOW YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE FULL AMOUNT OF RESOURCES FUNDING AND STAFFING THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. AT THE COMPLETION OF STAGE TWO OF THE POWER PROCESS OR THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS. BEFORE IT KIND OF MOVES INTO THE PROCUREMENT STAGE OF STAGE THREE SO THE LEGISLATURE REALLY HAS AN IDEA OF WHAT THOSE TOTAL COSTS ARE. THE SECOND ASPECT IS WE ARE ALSO RECOMMENDING THAT DOJ. PROVIDE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON KEY METRICS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE TASKS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY COST CHANGES ARE DELAYS AND PROJECT MILESTONES. AND IF THERE ARE ANY CHALLENGES ARE RISKS THAT HAVE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING TO ESSENTIALLY OFFSET THAT OR ADDRESS. AND SO. THAT WILL REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT STAYS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET. AND. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE CATHOLIC PUBLIC COMMITTEE ON OKAY I HOPE THEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M. SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE THE FOUNDATIONAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO TRANSITION. FROM THE CURRENT LIFETIME REGISTRATION SYSTEM TO A TIER BASED SYSTEM BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS REQUIREMENT THIS WILL REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO DO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES INCLUDING COLLECTING NEW DATA BOTH AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL. PROVIDING NEW DATA COLLECTION METHODS THAT ARE SO. STANDARDIZE ITS DISTINCT SUSTAINABLE AND ALSO A NEW BUSINESS PARTNERS CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNERS WILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US THAT DATA. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE MAJOR ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND OUR INTERFACES AND THEN. ACQUIRE NEW STAFF TO COME ON AND TRAIN STAFF TO DO ALL THE MANUAL WORK THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO THIS. IT'S A VERY EXTENSIVE ALMOST A FIVE YEAR PROJECT AND AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE. WHICH INCLUDES ASKS PUTTING TOGETHER A DETAILED PROJECT PLAN AND TWELVE ADDITIONAL PLANS THAT COVER EVERYTHING FROM RISK. CONSTRAINTS ANY ISSUES COMMUNICATIONS AND WERE ALMOST WE HAVE COMPLETED STATE ONE. WHERE ALMOST DONE WITH STAGE TWO WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE CONDUCT THIS PROJECT AND THE SYSTEMATIC ORDER WE HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY? TO THAT THIS IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE ENTIRE FIVE YEARS OF THE PROJECT SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE MONEY TO BUILD THE TECHNOLOGIES. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET THOSE TECHNOLOGIES IN PLACE SO WE CAN HAVE THE DATA THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE NEW TEARS. WE ALL STAFF ALSO HAVE TO HOW THOSE DATA EXCHANGE METHODS IN PLACE. SO WORKERS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNERS CAN GIVE US THAT DATA AND THEN WE HOP HAVE TO HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE SO ALL THOSE FOLKS THAT WE ARE HIRING TO DO THE MANUAL WORK. WILL HAVE SOMEWHERE TO PUT THAT DATA AND THE DATA WILL REMAIN FRESH AND BE ABLE TO BE PROCESSED WHEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE BUSINESS PARTNERS NEED THAT. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE HAVE THAT DATA ON ON GOING THAT THE FUNDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ENSURE THAT THIS. PROJECT THAT COMES TO FRUITION AND THAT THROUGH THE POWER PROJECT WHAT. A PROCESS THAT WE ARE COMPLETING RIGHT NOW WE'VE COMPLETED STAGE ONE STAGE TWO ARE ALL THESE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WANTING IN THESE REPORTS ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLANS THAT YOU LAND PLACE. THAT IS DONE IN STAGE TWO AND STAGE THREE FOR US NEEDS TO START ON JULY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO WE CAN HAVE VENDORS ON BOARD AND ON SITE. START BUILDING THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE WE ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THE MANDATED REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL BY JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY ONLY ONCE COMMENTS IN THE AUDIENCE. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT ITEM TWO IS BEING HELD OPEN WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT AT THIS POINT. STATEWIDE FORENSIC SERVICES. A MADAM CHAIR CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THIS REQUEST IS A. PROPOSAL TO SUPPORT OUR FRIENDS EX SERVICES IT'S ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AYE IT'S MADE UP OF TWO COMPONENTS THE FIRST ONE IS A SIX MILLION DOLLARS ASSOCIATE WITH THE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN DECLINING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND THEN FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH EQUIPMENT REFRESH ASSOCIATED WITH LAB EQUIPMENT. AND VERY MILLER IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM FINANCE BELIAU. WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE OVERALL PACKAGE ON THE WE WOULD MENTION THAT RELATED TO THE FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION TO REPLACE FORENSIC ACQUIT MEANT. HE WOULD ONLY REPLACE A SMALL SUBSET OF THE EQUIPMENT AND SO WE DO RECOMMEND ON THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED DOJ TERRACE SUBMIT A REPORT BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN ON IT'S LARGER PLAN RELATED TO FRIENDS EQUIPMENT IN THIS PLAN SHOULD INCLUDE ESSENTIALLY IN INVENTORY OF WHAT EQUIPMENT IS THERE WHAT EQUIPMENT THEY THINK IS NEEDED. HOW LONG EACH OF THOSE THE EACH OF THE MACHINES OR EQUIPMENT COULD OPERATE AND WHAT THE PLAN IS IN TERMS OF COSTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS? IN THIS INFORMATION WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE YOU KNOW WHAT ACTION IF ANY TO KIND OF TAKE IN THE FUTURE. OKAY. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS HERE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU LEAVE THAT ITEM OPEN AYE LAST ITEM IS YOU SEEN ON THE TWENTY NINTH. PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS. SO I WILL ACTUALLY BE PRESENTING US ON ON BEHALF OF ADMINISTRATION. SO THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO SHIFT BEGINNING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATIONS FOR NON MEDICAL PROP FIFTY SIX. FUNDS TO CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. THE SHIFT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAW WHICH REQUIRES THAT REVENUES BE CONTINUES THE APPROPRIATED FOR PURPOSES AND FURTHERANCE OF THE PROPOSITION. IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU FUNDS CREATED BY THE INITIATIVE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ADMINISTRATIVE WE ESTABLISHED FUNDS TO AID DEPARTMENTS AND PROGRAMS AND TRACKING THEIR PROP FIFTY SIX ALLOCATIONS AND EXPENDITURES. AND TO PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY. THE ADMINISTRATION FURTHER PROPOSES THE CHANGE TO CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS TO PROVIDE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN SPENDING PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS. THIS CHANGE AFFECTS PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX EXPENDITURES FOR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THESE APARTMENTS RECEIVED PROP SIXTEENTH IS FIFTY SIX FUNDING. THROUGH BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATIONS DURING. THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROPOSITION IMPLEMENTATION OF OFFICE CLEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. THESE FUNDS WITH CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION ITEMS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FUN CONDITION STATEMENTS. DISPLAY AS PART OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS OF THE LOW. THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE SEQUEL BUSH CAN CAN MONITOR THE BALANCE IN THE FUNDS. REFLECTS IT. ANY COMMENTS FROM LA UP. WE ARE UMBRAGE RECOMMENDING REJECTING ALL OF THE REQUESTS RELATED AND TO THIS CHANGE. AND SO A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AT THIS IMPACTS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS THE ONLY AREA THAT I THINK TO OUR KNOWLEDGE. WHERE THIS WASN'T REQUESTED FOR IS RELATED TO MEDI CAL? AND SO I'M WE DO AGREE THAT THE LANGUAGE OF THE INITIATIVE TALKS ABOUT CONTINUES APPROPRIATION FOR THE FIND. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS AS REQUIRED BY THE PROPOSITION. INVOLVED CHOICES THAT ARE KIND OF FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS ARE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE ACTUALLY SPECIFIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION RECEIVE NOT MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT OF NET REVENUE. AND SO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED ON THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY APPROVED AN AMOUNT THAT WAS LESS THAN THAT FIVE PERCENT. IS WITH THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATION IT'S ACTUALLY UNCLEAR TO US HOW THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE DETERMINED AND HOW WE WOULD NOW. AND SO GIVEN ADEQUATE TIME AND CONSIDERATION THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT DECIDE THAT A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS FOR DOJ IS APPROPRIATE. BUT BECAUSE THERE'S WE DON'T SEE AN NEED. TO KIND OF RUSSIAN MAKE A DECISION AT THIS TIME WE ACTUALLY THINK THIS DECISION CAN BE MADE IN JANUARY NEXT YEAR. ANY COMMENTS ON THE. OKAY ANY AUDIO MADAM CHAIR JUST ONE COMMENT RELATIVE TO THE DEPARTMENT JUST AS WE HAVE AT A LOCAL GRANTS TO GO OUT AND SO THERE'S A POT OF MONEY SPECIFIED IN THE. IN THE PROPOSITION THIRTY MILLION ON ANNUALLY. AT THE WOULD BE. ALLOW US A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY THROUGH A CONTINUOUS PREPARATION. RATHER THAN WAITING FOR AN AMOUNT TO BE APPROPRIATED OR TO GO THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS GIVEN THAT IT IS SPECIFIED. IN THE. IN THE PROP FIFTY SIX LANGUAGE SO WE WOULD SUPPORT THE ACADEMIA'S PREPARATION. ANY OTHER COMMENTS MEMBERS. AUDIENCE OF CONFINEMENT THAT ITEM TO WILL BE HELD OPEN THAT CONCLUDES OUR MEETING FOR TODAY THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED. AND WE WILL BE MEETING AGAIN I GUESS ON MONDAY. TO TAKE ACTION ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. MEETING IS ADJOURNED
