OF BRIEF ONES THAT ARE A LITTLE

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.110
BIT DIFFERENT -- FIRST I DO AND

00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:01.145

HOUSE MISTER FRAZIER MR HOLDEN A

00:38:03.247 --> 00:38:04.849

ADMINISTRATION UP A LITTLE BIT

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:14.191
AND CALLING FOR MORE BROAD BASED

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.459
APPROACH TO FUNDING.

00:38:15.526 --> 00:38:16.460
THIS COMMUNITY THAN WAS

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.162
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THAT WAS

00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:20.231
REALLY REALLY HELPFUL STEP.

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:20.831
THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE FELL

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:23.501
SHORT -- I THINK THAT PEOPLE

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:24.135
NEED TO REALIZE THAT THE RATE

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:25.369
STUDY.

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.038
YOUR SORTER REFERRING TO THIS

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.506
CONVENIENTLY IS THE BASIS OF THE

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:30.174
PROPOSALS WERE MAKING BUT IT

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:31.842
SEEM TIME IF WE'RE GOING TO USE

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:32.643
THE RATE STUDY AND REALLY USE

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:33.310
THAT.

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:34.912
IT ALSO CALLS FOR ONE POINT TWO

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:37.048
BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING NOT

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.215
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION -- TWO

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:40.051
HUNDRED THIRTY YEAR TWO HUNDRED

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:40.685
NINETY EIGHT CALLS FOR ONE POINT

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:41.318
TWO BILLION FUNDING.

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:42.486
SO WE NEED EVERYBODY TO

00:38:42.553 --> 00:38:44.555
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS  WORK

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.123
IN PROGRESS -- THIS IS A SYSTEM

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.458
THAT'S BEEN CHRONICALLY

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:48.726
UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS.

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:51.195
WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.596
SOME OF THE RECESSION ERA.

00:38:52.663 --> 00:38:56.300
CUTS THAT DATE ALL THE WAY BACK

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:57.234
TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ARE STILL

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.669
IN PLACE INCLUDING THE HALF THE

00:38:58.736 --> 00:38:59.537
BILLING.

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:01.772
A RESTRICTION INCLUDING THE

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.641
PROHIBITION OF FUNDING FOR

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:06.010
SOCIAL RACK IN CAMP PROGRAMS AND

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.044
I WANT TO NOTE ON THAT.

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:08.345
THOSE PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR HIT

00:39:08.412 --> 00:39:10.281
PEOPLE WHO ARE THE POOREST IN

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.783
CALIFORNIA I HAVE A TWENTY TWO

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.651
YEAR OLD SON WHO'S AT CAMP.

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:15.486
ODDLY ENOUGH RIGHT NOW I CAN

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.854
AFFORD TO SEND IN THEIR BROTHER

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:18.522
MANY PEOPLE THAT CANNOT.

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.458
IN UNLESS WE RESTORE THAT DEMI

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:22.026
DEMI DENY THEM OF THE ONE

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:23.360
OPPORTUNITYMIGHT HAVE FOR

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.862
SOCIAL INTERACTION.

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:25.930
AND GETTING OUT OF THEIR OWN

00:39:25.996 --> 00:39:27.531
WORLD EVERY YEAR AND THAT'S IT

00:39:27.598 --> 00:39:29.033
THAT'S IT CUT THE DIRECTLY

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.634
CORRELATES BACK.

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:31.869
AS DIRECTLY AS IT CAN BE TO THE

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.170
RECESSION YEAR THAT WE HAD IN

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:34.572
THE STATE WE ARE NOT IN A

00:39:34.638 --> 00:39:35.673
RECESSION TODAY.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.541
SO TO KEEP THAT CUT IN PLACE WE

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:39.143
THINK IS A A REAL MISSTEP.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.544
I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:42.346
ARE MANY PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:47.885
GET NOTHING UNDER THIS BUDGET NO

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.120
INCREASE.

00:39:49.186 --> 00:39:50.020
AND I KNOW WE HELP THEM HARMLESS

00:39:50.087 --> 00:39:51.021
WE AGAIN USE THE RATE STUDY

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:51.522
JUSTIFY.

00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:52.289
WHY THEY'RE GETTING NOTHING AND

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:53.090
THE THEORY WAS THAT THERE MAY BE

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:53.557
BEING OVER PAY TODAY?

00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:54.091
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THOSE

00:39:54.158 --> 00:39:55.359
PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING ABOUT IS

00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.795
LENA BASIS AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.463
YEAH AND THEY STILL FACE ALL THE

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.798
COST PRESSURES.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:02.032
THAT ARE GONNA BE.

00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:03.267
BEFALL THEM DURING THE YEAR HEAD

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:04.802
MINIMUM WAGE FOR EXAMPLE GOES UP

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:07.972
BY 8% OVER 8% CHEN MY FIRST

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:08.606
THEY'RE GONNA BE SUBJECTED TO

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:09.240
THAT.

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:10.608
THEY'RE SUBJECTED TO ALL THE

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:11.842
OTHER COST PRESSURES.

00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.377
THE END THIS STUFF HAS TO BE

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.446
LOOKED AT IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:16.480
ENCOURAGE YOU BEFORE THE END OF

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:18.182

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:01.679

SPEAKING AT LOWER INCOMES THAT

FEDERAL LEVEL WITH RESPECT TO

00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:14.525
CAPPING THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME --

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:16.293
THAT PEOPLE NEED TO SPEND IN

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.062
ORDER TO AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:19.396
AND THERE'S THERE IS NO SUCH

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.799
CAPEN SO THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:23.500
CONFERENCE COMPROMISED PROPOSAL --

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:25.235
WOULD RESULT IN PEOPLE NOT

00:43:25.302 --> 00:43:27.237
SPENDING MORE THAN ABOUT 18% OF

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:30.641
THEIR INCOME -- ON ON ON HEALTH

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:32.476
INSURANCE THROUGH THE EXCHANGE --

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:34.378
AND THE TO GIVE YOU A KIND OF A

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:35.212
SENSE IN TERMS OF HOW THE

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:36.814
PROPOSAL'S EVOLVED IT MAY

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.415
REVISION AT THAT FUNDING LEVEL

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:40.384
THAT WAS AROUND 25% OF OF

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.119
SOMEONE'S INCOME ON HEALTH

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:42.853
INSURANCE.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.155
SO -- THAT THE PROPOSAL'S

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:48.058
DESIGNED TO REALLY -- REDUCE --

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:50.094
THE UNINSURED RATE BY BY MAKING

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.462
THE COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR

00:43:51.528 --> 00:43:53.230
PEOPLE IN THAT MIDDLE INCOME

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.865
RANGE WHERE THERE AREN'T

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:56.400
SUBSIDIES AVAILABLE TODAY.

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:57.301
OKAY WELL I THINK THAT YOU'VE

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:58.769
GOT TO THE CRUX OF OUR

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.437
DISAGREEMENT WHICH IS THAT -- I

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:05.509
THINK THAT OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO

00:44:05.576 --> 00:44:07.544
INCREASE COVERAGE RATES -- AND

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:08.178
EAT THE YOU SAID THAT THE GOAL

00:44:08.245 --> 00:44:09.580
WITH THIS LEGISLATION IS.

00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:11.215
TO US CAP THE PERCENTAGE OF

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:12.316
SOMEONE'S INCOME THAT THEY SPEND

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.684
ON HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH ARE

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:14.218
TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:17.187
BECAUSE I DISPUTE THAT GIVING

00:44:17.254 --> 00:44:18.522
SOMEONE A SUBSIDY OF INTO A SIX

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:19.823
ARE PERCENT OF THE FPL.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:21.592
THAT SO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:22.559
DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL IT'S

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.094
ALMOST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.763
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FAMILY OF

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.097
FOUR THREE ACTUALLY FAMILY.

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.732
THREE SO I DON'T THINK THAT

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.067
GIVING A SUBSIDY TO PEOPLE IN

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:31.869
THOSE RANGES IS GONNA WHAT IS

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:32.436
GOING TO BE WHAT MAKES THE

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.203
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THEM

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.139
GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE AND I'M

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:36.407
NOT GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE --

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:37.341
AND AND YOU KNOW THE OTHER

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:38.442
PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AND I

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:39.576
REALIZE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:40.778
SEPARATE TRAILER BILL THAT

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.112
IMPLEMENTS THE MANDATE AND THE

00:44:42.179 --> 00:44:43.647
PENALTY THAT SUPPOSEDLY GOES TO

00:44:43.714 --> 00:44:44.848
FUND.

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:47.017
THIS EXPANSION OF SUBSIDY BUT

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:48.452
THE PEOPLE IN THOSE THE PEOPLE

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:50.020
WILL BE PAYING THE PENALTY TO

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:52.122
FUND OF THESE SUBSIDIES ARE IN A

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:53.057
MUCH LOWER.

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:54.591
INCOME RANGE I MEAN WE'RE

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.160
TALKING ABOUT.

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:56.794
THIRTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.928
A YEAR MOST OF THEM SO AND TO ME

00:44:57.995 --> 00:44:59.863
IT MAKES NO SENSE TO TAKE MONEY

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.799
FROM SOMEONE MAKING THIRTY TO

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:02.399
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR

00:45:02.466 --> 00:45:05.002
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEONE MAKING

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:09.206
752-003-0000 DOLLARS A YEAR --

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:09.740
AND AND I GUESS THAT'S THE

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:10.808
PROBLEM THAT I HAVE.

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.643

THAT INDICATE THAT THE

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.595

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:55.432
THE FIRST THING THAT THIS BILL

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:01.972
AND IT FOCUSES ON THREE MAJOR

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.540
CHANGES THE FIRST IS

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:04.941
IMPLEMENTING A NEW YOUNG CHILD

ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:16.086
THE SECOND ITEM IN THIS BILL IS

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.254
INCREASING THE INCOME

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.456
ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD TO THIRTY

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.257
THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS MEANS THAT

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.225
ANYBODY IN THE FAMILY MAKING

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.493

IN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:28.165

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:32.736
QUALIFY FOR THIS CREDIT.

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.770
AND THEN THE THIRD THING THAT

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:34.971
THIS BILL DOES ON THE EARNED

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:36.707
INCOME TAX CREDIT SIDE IS

THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIRTY

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:41.978
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.046
RIGHT NOW THE EARNED INCOME TAX

00:49:43.113 --> 00:49:45.716

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:47.284
TOWARD FAMILIES BETWEEN -- ZERO

AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AS IT

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:49.619
SHOULD BE BECAUSE THOSE ARE

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:51.988
LOWEST INCOME WORKING FAMILIES

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:53.390

THOUSAND WHEN IT COMES TO THE

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:59.229
TAX CONFORMITY PROVISIONS.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.997
THESE ARE PROVISIONS THAT OFTEN

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:01.898
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:50:01.965 --> 00:50:03.433
PASSES A TAX BILL THE STATE

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.001
TAKES CONFORMING ACTIONS EITHER

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.403
BECAUSE THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:07.804
OF ERRORS IN ANY PENALTIES THAT

00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:08.972
GO WRONG WITH THOSE ERRORS.

00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:10.040
THEY REDUCE THE BURDEN ON

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:11.308
TAXPAYERS SO THAT THEY DON'T

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:12.909
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH TWO SETS OF

00:50:12.976 --> 00:50:14.845

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:18.482
LOGICAL.

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:19.783

ON THE ITEMS THAT COST REVENUE

00:50:57.654 --> 00:50:58.789
BUT WE THINK MAKE GOOD PUBLIC

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.457
POLICY SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.025

THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO LIKE

00:51:56.513 --> 00:51:57.614
KIND EXCHANGE IS WHEN THE

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:58.949
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:02.052
OUT OF LIKE KIND EXCHANGES FOR

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:04.187
MOST PROPERTY THEY ALSO ADDED A

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:06.523
BONUS DEPRECIATION PROVISION.

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:08.325

WHAT THEY WERE TAKING WAY WITH.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.895
WITH ROLLING BACK THE OKAY HE'S

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:14.564
NOW WE ARE CONFORMING TO THE

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:15.899

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:21.905
THAT DECISION WAS MADE.

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:23.673
YES SO THE GENERAL APPROACH THE

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.041
TAXING FOR MANY PACKAGES IS NOT

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:26.776
A FULL CONFORMITY BUT ONLY THOSE

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:28.278
ITEMS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:29.246
WORKING WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.580
LEGISLATURE BELIEVE MAKES SENSE

00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:32.082
SO WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE KIND

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.250
EXCHANGE IS.

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.851
THIS BASICALLY ALLOWS.

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.186
CORPORATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.988

THE TIME OF THAT TRANSACTION.

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.098
AND SO YOU ARE RIGHT THAT AT THE

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:49.065
FEDERAL LEVEL THEY PAIRED IT

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.901
WITH BONUS DEPRECIATION -- BUT

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.736
THE FACT IS SOME OF THE POLICIES

00:52:52.802 --> 00:52:53.904
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL MADE SENSE

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:55.772
AND SOME DID AND FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:56.706
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CUT THEIR

BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO CUT THAT

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:02.979
RATE.

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:03.847
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.295
CALIFORNIA BUT WE CAN CONFORM TO

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:19.930
THAT PROVISION AS WELL SO.

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:20.797
WITH REGARD TO THE BIKE KIND

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.198
EXCHANGES THAT PROVISION MADE

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.733
SENSE TO US WE DID INCLUDE A

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.802
CARVE OUT FOR PERSONAL INCOME

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:26.970
TAXPAYERS WITH INCOMES.

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.071
OF LESS THAN HALF A MILLION

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:29.706
DOLLARS FOR MARRIED HOUSEHOLDS

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:31.041
BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE IT MADE

00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:32.042
SENSE TO INCLUDED EXPENSING OR

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:34.077
BONUS DEPRECIATION PROVISION AS

00:53:34.144 --> 00:53:34.778
WELL.

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:36.513
OKAY WELL KNOWN AS WE WERE NEVER

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.815
TALK ABOUT 1100% CONFORMITY TO

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.816
FEDERAL TAX LAW.

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:41.084
BUT CERTAINLY FOR GOING TO

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.919
CONFORM A PROVISION TO FEDERAL

00:53:42.986 --> 00:53:44.487
TAX LAW I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT

00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:45.855
TO CHERRY PICK AND SAVE WE'RE

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:46.856
GONNA CAR ABOUT THAT.

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:52.896
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA TAKE THE

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:54.130
PARTS THAT INCREASE STATE

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:54.898
REVENUE AND WE GONNA CARVE OUT

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:56.132
THE PARTS THAT DECREASE STATE

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:56.866
REVENUE.

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:57.934
AND I DISAGREE WITH YOUR

00:53:58.001 --> 00:53:59.235
ASSERTION THAT -- THIS ISN'T

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:00.236
GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:01.204
TAXPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:02.105
BUT FOR BUSINESSES.

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:03.106
IF YOU HAVE A BUSINESS A PIECE

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:04.507
OF BUSINESS EQUIPMENT.

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:05.742
AND IT'S FULLY DEPRECIATED AND

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.010
YOU BUY A NEW PIECE OF BUSINESS

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.478
EQUIPMENT TO REPLACE IT UNDER

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:10.213
THE OLD LAW YOU COULD CALL THAT

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.982
LIKE AND TO CHANGE AND NOT AND

00:54:12.048 --> 00:54:13.650
NOT HAVE TO RE CAPTURE A BUNCH

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.118
OF DEPRECIATION ON THAT ASSET.

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:17.153
IN -- WITHOUT BONUS DEPRECIATION

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.088
WITH THE ACTION THAT YOU'RE

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:19.322
PROPOSING TO TAKE YOU WELL AND

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.658
SO I MEAN THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:22.292
THAT I HAVE I'LL GIVE ANOTHER

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.193
EXAMPLE.

00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:24.794
THE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:54:24.861 --> 00:54:25.729
ABLE ACCOUNTS.

00:54:25.795 --> 00:54:28.131
AND ARE CONFORMING TO FEDERAL

00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:29.899
LAW TO BE ABLE TO ROLL OVER A

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:30.900
FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN A COLLEGE

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.335
SAVINGS PLAN INTO AN ABLE

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:33.603
ACCOUNT WHICH I THINK IS GREAT.

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:35.739
BUT WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.340
CONFORM FEDERAL TAX TO FEDERAL

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:38.441
TAX LAW.

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:39.743
THAT PERMITS THE DEDUCTIBILITY

00:54:39.809 --> 00:54:41.678
OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO A FIVE

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:42.679
TWENTY NINE PLAN.

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:45.048
SO AGAIN THE QUESTIONS WILL WIRE

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:46.650
WITH CHERRY PICKING AND SAYING --

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:47.917
WE'RE JUST GONNA CONFORM THIS

00:54:47.984 --> 00:54:48.551
THIS AND THIS BUT NOT THIS IN

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:54.391
THIS AN ENEMY ON THE FIVE TWENTY

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:55.058
NINE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:55.692
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE SINGLE.

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:56.292
BIGGEST THING THAT THE STATE

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:56.893
COULD DO TO INCREASE COLLEGE

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.395
SAVINGS RATES AND YET WE'RE NOT

00:54:58.461 --> 00:55:01.264
CONFORMING THAT SO WHY NOT.

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:03.066
SO ON THE FIVE TO NINE I NEED TO

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.567
LOOK THAT UP SIR YOU SAYING THAT

00:55:04.634 --> 00:55:05.802
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWS

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.704
TAX DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:11.007
A FIVE TWO NOTES CORRECT.

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.342
YEAH THE I I DON'T I DON'T

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:14.444
BELIEVE THAT WAS PART OF THE TAX

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.312
CUTS AND JOBS ACT BUT IT WAS IT

00:55:16.379 --> 00:55:18.715
WAS IT NO WAS NOT IT WAS OKAY IT

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:19.315
REALLY IS ALREADY RIGHT YEAH

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.383
THAT'S THAT'S A PROVISION OF

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.452
FEDERAL LAW THAT THE STATE IS

00:55:22.519 --> 00:55:22.852
NEVER COME RIGHT.

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:23.586
RIGHT YEAH.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:24.187
BUT MY QUESTION IS WE HAVE A

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:26.056
WIFE OR CONFORMING SOME OF STATE

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:26.656
LAW.

00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:28.591
ON FIVE TWENTY NINTHS TO FEDERAL

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.894
LAW WHY NOT CONFORM ALL OF THEM.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.263
WELL I I I'D SAY -- IN ORDER TO

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.497
TO HAVE THESE ACCOUNTS WORK

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:37.233
PROPERLY DEDUCTIBILITY IS NOT.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:40.103
IS NOT ESSENTIAL BUT HAVING THIS

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.871
THE INCOME LIMITS AND HAVE THE

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:42.706
THE AMOUNTS THAT THAT ARE

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:44.007
CONSIDERED QUALIFIED THAT IS

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.544
REALLY ESSENTIAL TO HAVING THESE --

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:49.145
TO HAVE THESE WORK BETWEEN

00:55:49.212 --> 00:55:50.380
FEDERAL AND SAY YOU WANT HAVE

AS DETECTABILITY THAT ISN'T

00:55:53.750 --> 00:56:02.692
ESSENTIAL. TO TO IT TO HAVE THE

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:03.526
THE I I GUESS WHEN ONCE AND YOU

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:04.094
DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.128
WHERE IF YOU COMPLY WITH

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:05.829
CALIFORNIA LAWS.

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:06.830
WE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAWS YOU

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:07.564

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.298
WITH THE OTHER LAW.

00:56:08.364 --> 00:56:09.399
OKAY AND AND AND THAT'S WHERE

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:10.033
THAT'S WE WERE KIND OF CONFORM

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.668
YOUR NOW DEDUCTIBILITY IS JUST A

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:13.069

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:15.772
CONTRIBUTION TO I GET TO TAKE A

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:17.040

LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS WAS AN

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:28.318
OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO TAKE SOME

00:56:28.384 --> 00:56:29.419
OF THIS REVENUE.

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:30.954
AND MAKE THOSE FIVE TWENTY NINE

GETS HELD AND THE REASON IS

00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:44.601
BECAUSE REVENUE LOSS AND SO WE

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:44.801

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:18.187
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WHAT HAPPENED

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:20.323
TO IT -- CERTAINLY WITH -- ARE

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.791
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES IN

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.993
CRISIS FACING THE STATE -- IT

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.528
WOULD BE KIND OF A WHAT WAITED

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.497
TO ALLOW MORE CAPITAL TO FLOW

00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:29.799
INTO AREAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:59:29.866 --> 00:59:31.567
AND BE BUILT SO I WAS PLANNING

00:59:31.634 --> 00:59:32.201
IF YOU COULD JUST TOUCH ON THAT

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:32.702
FOR A MOMENT.

00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:33.903
YES I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:35.605
THAT AND IT'S JANUARY PROPOSAL

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:36.839
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:59:36.906 --> 00:59:38.708
ADMINISTRATION HAD EXPRESSED

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:39.943
INTEREST IN WORKING WITH MEMBERS

00:59:40.009 --> 00:59:42.111
OF THE LEGISLATURE ON AT

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:43.379
PROPOSAL ON OPPORTUNITY ZONES.

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:45.048
NOT NECESSARILY COMPLETE

00:59:45.114 --> 00:59:45.615
CONFORMITY WITH THE FEDERAL

00:59:45.682 --> 00:59:47.951
GOVERNMENT BUT ON PROJECTS IN

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:50.119
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS THAT EITHER --

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:51.387
HELP WITH GREEN JOBS OR HELP

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:52.755
WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING SICKLY

00:59:52.822 --> 00:59:54.891
TECHNOLOGY AND HOUSING AND THE

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.392
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DESIGNATED

00:59:56.459 --> 00:59:58.361
I THINK WAS -- EIGHT HUNDRED

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.195
SEVENTY NINE SUCH ZONES ACROSS

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.396
THE STATE -- WHERE THESE

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:01.898
PROJECTS COULD TAKE PLACE --

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.633
BETWEEN JANUARY AND TODAY IN

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.201
JUNE WE WEREN'T ABLE TO REACH A

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:06.903
FINAL AGREEMENT WITH MEMBERS OF

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.204
THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT THAT

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.739
WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT WE'RE

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:11.140
COMMITTED TO DOING THAT -- AND

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:15.611
SEEING IF WE CAN WORK OUT AN

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:16.245
AGREEMENT BEFORE THE END OF THE

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:18.147
YEAR.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:18.948
IF I IF I JUST A LITTLE MORE

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.116
QUESTION WHY WOULD NOT WHY WOULD

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.651
WE JUST COMPLETELY CAN FORM AND

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:22.385
AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES OWNS

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:23.886
NOT SPECIFIC TO ONE THING BUT

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:26.656
ALLOW IT. TO BE USED MORE WIDELY.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:27.690
SO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:28.658
WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.792
SUGGESTED THAT THE FEDERAL

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:30.927
PROPOSAL HAD A LOT OF BENEFITS

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:31.961
BUT ALSO RAISED A NUMBER OF

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:33.296
CONCERNS AND I THINK WE'VE

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.230
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.264
BENEFITS BUT SOME OF THE

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:36.699
CONCERNS WORK.

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:37.700
IF IT'S CASTING TOO WIDE AND

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:39.635
THAT WE MAY BE CUTTING TAXES FOR

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:41.504
PROJECTS THAT MIGHT ALREADY BE

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:42.638
HAPPENING ANYWAY AND DON'T

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.207
NECESSARILY NEED AN ADDITIONAL

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:45.375
INCENTIVE -- AND SO WE'RE

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.976
DEPRIVING THE STATE OF REVENUE

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:48.511
FOR OTHER PROGRAMS WITHOUT

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:49.679
NECESSARILY SPRING YOU ECONOMIC

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.748
DEVELOPMENT ANOTHER CONCERN WAS

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.349
THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS TAX

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:54.183
BENEFIT MIGHT BE BENEFITING

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.618
PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE STATE OF

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:56.652
CALIFORNIA.

01:00:56.719 --> 01:00:57.487
WHICH ARE GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY

01:00:57.553 --> 01:00:58.988
BUT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE

01:00:59.055 --> 01:01:00.656
PUTTING OUR STATE DOLLARS MIGHT

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:01.224
NOT MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.425
CALIFORNIA.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.327
AND THEN FINALLY AND WITH REGARD

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.295
TO PROJECT AREAS -- IN TERMS OF

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.397
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.931
ON THOSE THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:09.399
FOR THE STATE TO THE

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:10.533
ADMINISTRATION AS IDENTIFIED

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.301
HOUSING AS WELL AS CLEAN

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.037
TECHNOLOGIES TO KEY AREAS --

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.638
WERE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:16.472
TO DEFINE THOSE ARE LOOK AT

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.074
THOSE DEFINITIONS BUT WE

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.042
WONDERED WHETHER A CLEAN

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.510
CONFORMITY MIGHT CAUSE MORE

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:21.878
PROBLEMS IN COST AND THE

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:24.847
BENEFITS THAT THE STATE RECEIVES

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.849
AS A RESULT.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.484
THANK YOU MISS WORKS.

YEAH TO SEE I THINK IT'S A

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.262
CRITICAL SOCIAL SAFETY NET HAS

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:40.229
IN THAT.

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:40.863
HUGE IMPACT ON A LOT OF PEOPLE'S

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.732
LIVES -- AND BELIEVE WE SHOULD

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:45.268
BE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS I DO --

01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.335

WE WOULD THAT WE COULD RECTIFY

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.043
THIS AND THE FUTURE SETTINGS ARE

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:54.677
CRITICAL OF THESE ARE CRITICAL

MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT I

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:59.515
THINK SHOULD BENEFIT FROM.

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:01.918
FROM THIS AS WELL.

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.920
THANK YOU MISTER KARGER.

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:04.887

ALREADY TALKED ABOUT BUT YOU

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:06.122
KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES IS

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:09.292
THE THE ABILITY TO DEDUCT NON

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:12.361
CORPORATE BUSINESS LOSSES RIGHT.

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:14.263
AND SO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME IT

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.731
REALLY THE CHANGES.

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:16.365
THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:18.668
CAP -- IT'S JUST A CHANGING

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:21.838
CHANGING WHAT THE CAP IS ON

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:24.841
BUSINESS NON CORPORATE BUSINESS

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.609
LOSS DEDUCTIONS RIGHT CAN YOU.

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:28.010
WHAT IS IT NOW WHAT WOULD IT

01:02:28.077 --> 01:02:29.245
CHANGE TO UNDER THIS SIZE NOT

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.446
SURE IF THEY WERE PRE IF THERE

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.914
WAS PREVIOUSLY A CAT THERE WAS

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:33.583
NOT PREVIOUSLY A CAP ON

01:02:33.649 --> 01:02:35.618
DEDUCTION AGAINST OTHER INCOME?

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.687
OKAY.

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:38.821
AND AND SO YEAH SO SO THERE IS

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:39.422
NO CAP PREVIOUSLY WHICH MEANT

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:40.056
THAT.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.424
NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.726
MADE WAGES ARE CAPITAL ONE TIME

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:45.962
OR INTEREST INCOME -- IF YOU HAD

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:46.863
A BUSINESS LOSS THAT EXCEEDED

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.231
BACK THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.466
PAY ANY TAXES ON THAT WAGES SO

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.168
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:54.937
WAS SAY THAT -- UNLESS IT'S MORE

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.939
THAN UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.141
DOLLARS FOR A MARRIED COUPLE YOU

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.409
CAN STILL DO THAT BUT ABOUT FIVE

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:01.110
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.778
CAN'T DO THAT IN THAT TAX YEAR

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:03.980
AND YOU WOULD HAVE TO CARRY IT

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.982
FORWARD. TO A FUTURE YEARS THE

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.617
FEDERAL ALSO DISALLOWED KERRY

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:09.352
BACKS WHICH ARE BILL PROPOSES

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.720
CONFORMING TO AS WELL.

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:12.622
RIGHT SO YOU'D STILL BE ABLE TO

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:16.559
DEDUCT UP.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.193
TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:18.728
LOSSES RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:19.328
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.363
INCOME FIRST OF ALL.

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:23.199
THAT'S CORRECT FOR MORE -- IN IT

01:03:23.266 --> 01:03:24.967
TO DEDUCT THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:27.670
DOLLARS IF YOU'RE MARRIED IT'S

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:28.237
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT'S

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:28.938
CORRECT.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.740
OF LOSSES -- I BELIEVE

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:31.874
PREVIOUSLY WASN'T THERE A RULE

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.010
ABOUT YOU CAN ONLY DEDUCT UP

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:36.012
280% OF YOUR INCOME.

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.346
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY.

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.782
THIS IS ACTUALLY THE NEW ROLE SO --

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.884
WHAT THE PREVIOUS ROLE WAS

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.553
BEFORE THAT DAY TAX REFORM BILL

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:45.221
PASSED IN DC WAS?

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:47.690
YOU CAN ONLY CARRY FORWARD UP TO

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:48.558
TWENTY YEARS I BELIEVE THAT'S

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.826
RIGHT BUT YOU CAN DEDUCT ALL OF

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.828
THE INCOME ALL ALL THE ALL THE

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:57.800
LOSSES THAT YOU HAD.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:58.834
YOU COULD YOU COULD USE UP ON

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.036
YOU COULD OFFSET A 100% OF YOUR

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.270

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:02.238

THOSE.

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:06.142
FORWARD YEAH SO THAT THAT NET

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.043
OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.511
AND NOW CHANGED TO WHERE THERE'S

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:10.379
NO TWENTY YEAR TIME LIMIT IT'S

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:11.948
NOW ON LIMITED AT THE FEDERAL

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:14.483
LEVEL -- BUT FOR ON YOUR FEDERAL

80% OF YOUR INCOME RIGHT WE ARE

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:22.959
NOT PROPOSING TO CONFORM TO THAT

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:23.526
AND THAT GOES THE NEXUS SO.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:24.160
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THE

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.461
FULL BENEFIT OF THOSE LOSSES

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.029
THAT YOU EXPERIENCE YOU'RE JUST

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:27.630
GOING TO BE -- YOU JUST TAKEN

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.598
OVER TIME.

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.299
YES -- UNDER OUR PROVISIONED --

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.301
AND ANY GIVEN YEAR YOU IT'S

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.136
CAPPED AT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:35.271
FOR A COUPLE BUT BACK IN THE

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:37.673
RIGHT.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.342
AND THAT'S IN ITS UNLIMITED

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.544
THERE'S NOT A TWENTY YEAR TIME

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:46.315
LIMIT NOW RIGHT. FOR THERE IS A

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.551
TWENTY BECAUSE WE CAN COULD HARM.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:51.721
I DO I DO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE

01:04:51.787 --> 01:04:54.624

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:55.625
AND THERE IS NO POLICE ON THE

YEAH I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE I

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:57.526
BELIEVE WE ARE CONFORMED WITH

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.928
THAT PREVIOUS FEDERAL ITEM ON

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:01.297
THAT RIGHT.

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:02.131
THE MINUTE I MEAN IN AND I AM

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.065
THIS THE REASON BEHIND THAT

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.166
OBVIOUS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WAS

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.167
YOU KNOW WE WANTED WE DON'T KNOW

01:05:05.234 --> 01:05:06.402
SO I WANT TO INCENTIVIZE

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:07.003
ENCOURAGE LOSSES WHO WANT TO

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.037
ENCOURAGE.

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:09.171
PRODUCTIVITY.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.007
RIGHT AND SO CERTAINLY WAS TO

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:12.908
ALLOW PEOPLE TO DEDUCT LOSSES

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.043
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE LOSSES

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.779
WHEN YOU TAKE A RISK YOU INVEST

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:19.181
IN BUSINESS -- BUT PUT SOME KIND

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.651
OF LIMIT ON THAT ON AN ANNUAL

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:22.885
BASIS.

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:25.988
OBVIOUSLY TO INCENTIVIZE.

01:05:26.055 --> 01:05:27.556
YOU KNOW -- MORE OBVIOUSLY

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.325
PRODUCTIVITY FROM THAT FROM THAT

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.193
BUSINESS IS THAT IS THAT KIND OF

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.461
THE AND I MEAN.

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:33.562
YEAH THAT'S GENERALLY CORRECT

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.097
AND WE DO SEE INSTANCES WITHOUT

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:37.300
GOING INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL SOME

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:38.434
BUSINESSES SOME.

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:39.402
PEOPLE ENGAGE IN A BUSINESS ARE

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:42.271
VERY ADEPT AT GENERATING LOSSES --

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:43.839
YOU THROUGH USE OF STRATEGIC USE

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.341
OF DEPRECIATION AND OTHER

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.108
TECHNIQUES AND AND NOT ACTUALLY

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:46.976
PAYING.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:49.745

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:59.388
MARRIED COUPLE.

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:00.723
OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT.

YES THANK YOU JUST A QUICK

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.293

THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT.

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:19.442
SO IT WOULD BE PER HOUSEHOLD --

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:21.977
SO PREFER ONE FILING UNIT THEY

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:23.312

QUALIFIED TAXPAYERS.

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:32.588
SO IN THIS INSTANCE IT WOULD BE

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.323
