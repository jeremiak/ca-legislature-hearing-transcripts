I JOINED THE LEGISLATURE. IT

00:27:49.868 --> 00:27:50.969

RIGHT THEN IN THE EVICTION

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.409
CONTEXT AND PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:59.344
MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:02.781
TODAY I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB

FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. WHICH

WILL ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:06.084
LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION

00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.452
FUND KNOWN AS THE HOMELESSNESS

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.587
PREVENTION FUND. TO PROTECT OUR

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:10.789
MOST VULNERABLE RENTERS AND

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.057
HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:14.526
BEFORE IT BEGINS. THIS BILL IS

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:16.728
BASED ON THREE KEY NOTIONS. THE

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.196
FIRST IS THAT EVICTION DEFENSE

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:19.330
IS KEY TO MEANINGFULLY

00:28:19.397 --> 00:28:20.465
ADDRESSING OUR HOMELESSNESS

00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:21.599
CRISIS IN THE STATE OF

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:22.567
CALIFORNIA WE SPEND A LOT OF

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:24.569
TIME. AND MONEY FOCUSED ON HOW

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:26.404
WE HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:27.138
CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:29.007
HOMELESSNESS BUT NOT ENOUGH ON

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:30.408
HOW WE CAN PREVENT HOMELESSNESS

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:31.309
FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST

00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:33.044
INSTANCE. AND THE DATA MAKES

00:28:33.111 --> 00:28:34.813
CLEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:35.880
NEED TO FOCUS ON IN L. A.

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:38.016
COUNTY ON AVERAGE EVERY SINGLE

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:40.385
DAY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN PEOPLE

00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.554
ARE HOUSED. IN TWO HUNDRED

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.121
TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE BECOME

00:28:43.188 --> 00:28:44.622
NEWLY HOMELESS TWO THIRDS FOR

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:46.524
THE FIRST TIME. SO THE PROBLEM

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.560
GETS WORSE EVERY DAY AND THE

00:28:48.626 --> 00:28:49.928
DATA MAKES CLEAR THAT EVICTIONS

00:28:49.994 --> 00:28:51.229
PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DRIVING

00:28:51.296 --> 00:28:53.031
HOMELESSNESS SO WE SURE WANT TO

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:53.765
SERIOUSLY ADDRESS OUR

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.034
HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WE NEED TO

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:57.635
ADDRESS AFFECTIONS. THE SECOND

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:58.937
NOTION IS THAT LEGAL SERVICES

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:01.639
ARE AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. AND

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:02.574
COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.742
ISSUE. AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.044
THE IMPORTANT TENANT

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.212
PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE PASSED

00:29:07.278 --> 00:29:08.713
RECENTLY. ARE NOT SELF

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.215
EXECUTING. THEY REQUIRE

00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:11.916
KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:13.218
THE LEGAL PROCESS AND OF LEGAL

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:14.953
RIGHTS. AND THAT IS EXACTLY

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.754
WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. AND WE

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:17.789
KNOW THAT RIGHT TO COUNSEL

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:19.224
PROGRAMS ARE PROVEN TO PREVENT

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:20.558
HOMELESSNESS WE'VE SEEN THIS

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.293
FROM INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS. WE

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.795
KNOW THAT THEY ARE PROVEN TO

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.930
SAVE TAXPAYER RESOURCES. IN NEW

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.298
YORK THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SAVE

00:29:27.365 --> 00:29:29.367
OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:29.901
DOLLARS FROM THE RIGHT TO

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.903
COUNSEL PROGRAM. AND IN LA AN

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.338
INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FROM FOR

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:35.039
EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. THE

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:36.207
STATE BE THEIR PUBLIC

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.809
BENEFITTED IN FORT FOUR DOLLARS

00:29:37.876 --> 00:29:38.943
AND FIFTY CENTS IN AVOIDED

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.512
COSTS AND SO WE HAVE CAREFULLY

00:29:40.578 --> 00:29:42.247
CRAFTED THIS PROGRAM. TO

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:45.049
LEVERAGE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.784
AND AREAS OF EXPERTISE. AND THE

00:29:46.851 --> 00:29:48.153
THIRD IS THAT MEANINGFUL ACCESS

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:49.420
TO JUSTICE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:51.923
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. ENGRAVED ON

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.690
THE FRONT OF THE UNITED STATES

00:29:52.757 --> 00:29:54.192
SUPREME COURT OR THE WORDS

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.161
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. BUT

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:57.262
YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:58.563
LEGAL DISPUTE WITH POTENTIALLY

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.565
LIFE CHANGING CONSEQUENCES

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.167
WHERE ONE PARTY IS REPRESENTED

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:03.801
AND THE OTHER IS NOT. THE

00:30:03.868 --> 00:30:04.869
NOTION OF EQUAL JUSTICE CAN

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:06.371
SEEM ILLUSORY. AND IN THIS

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:08.072
CONTEXT WE KNOW THAT 90% OF

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.408
LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED

00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:11.242
COMPARED TO ONLY 10% OF

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:13.178
TENANTS. AND SO THIS BILL WILL

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:14.812
HELP TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:15.313
FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.148
CALIFORNIANS. I WANT TO KNOW

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.283
THE REPRESENTATION DOESN'T

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:20.151
CHANGE THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW. IT

00:30:20.218 --> 00:30:21.352
DOESN'T CHANGE LEGAL RIGHTS AND

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:23.254
DUTIES IT DOESN'T PUT A THUMB

00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:24.756
ON THE SCALE. IT MERELY MEANS

00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.124
THAT EVICTION PROCEEDINGS ARE

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:28.126
MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE DECIDED

00:30:28.193 --> 00:30:29.928
BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW.

00:30:29.994 --> 00:30:31.529
RATHER THE INABILITY TO AFFORD

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:33.264
AN ATTORNEY. AND SO THIS BILL

00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:34.732
WILL HELP SECURE ACCESS TO

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.800
JUSTICE IN A MANNER THAT SAVES

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:37.702
LIVES IT SAVES TAXPAYER

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:40.505
RESOURCES. AND HELP OUR JUSTICE

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:41.105
SYSTEM LIVE UP TO ITS HIGHEST

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:42.840
IDEALS. THAT'S PART OF THE

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:43.708
REASON IT'S SUPPORTED BY A

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.543
BROAD COALITION OF MORE THAN

REALITY IS THAT THESE MOTIONS

ARE USED TO CAUSE A DELAY NOT

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:29.700

VERY SPECIFICALLY THE INLAND

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:42.106
EQUITY PARTNERSHIP. WHICH IS

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:43.807
WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE

00:45:43.874 --> 00:45:46.043
COMMUNITY TO TRY TO AVOID THESE

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.078
EVICTIONS AND AVOID FUTURE

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.914
HOMELESSNESS- AND THE COMMENTS

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.249

GATHER FROM THERE THE COMMENTS

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.156
IS THAT THEY DO AGREE THAT

00:45:59.223 --> 00:45:59.690
THERE SHOULD BE FREE LEGAL

00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:02.126
SERVICES. AS I SAY FOR ACTUAL

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:04.595
TENANTS IN NEED- AND MY

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:06.663
QUESTION TO YOU IS WILL YOU

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:09.299
OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:10.868
THE LOOPHOLES THAT THEY HAVE

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.871
DESCRIBED. WILL BE CLOSED TO

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:17.841
MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HELP THOSE

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:19.376
TENANTS THAT MOST NEED THE HELP.

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:20.410
YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WE'RE

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:22.045
ALWAYS COMMITTED TO WORKING

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:22.446
WITH PEOPLE HAVING

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:23.380
CONVERSATIONS AND CERTAINLY

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.149
ONE- YOU KNOW WANT TO HAVE ANY

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:26.183
LOOPHOLES IN THE BILL I THINK

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.918
THERE'S A TRADE OFF HERE. THAT

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:28.919
WE'RE LOOKING TO BALANCE

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.821
BETWEEN EFFECTIVELY TARGETING

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:31.788
THOSE AND THAT'S VERY CLEARLY

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:33.557
STATED IN THE INTENT AND

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.159
SPELLED OUT. VERSES CREATING A

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.227
NET ON UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:38.128
OBSTACLES THAT WOULD PREVENT

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.496
PARTNERSHIPS A LOT OF THIS BILL

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.398
IS ABOUT LEVERAGE ABOUT.

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:42.332
ORGANIZATIONS BEING ABLE TO

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:43.767
WORK TOGETHER I THINK

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:44.668
ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:45.536
TO LEAVE IT UP TO A LOT OF

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.337
THESE. REALLY WELL RESPECTED

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:48.672
BLUE CHIP LEGAL SERVICE

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:49.640
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PUBLIC

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:50.774
COUNTS ON THE LEGAL A

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.509
FOUNDATIONAL LOS ANGELES. TO

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:53.844
MAKE THE DECISION TO HOW TO

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.045
TARGET THOSE RESOURCES THEY'VE

00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:56.947
BEEN GIVEN DIRECTION TO TARGET

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.448
THEM TO THEM THOSE WHO ARE MOST

00:46:58.515 --> 00:47:00.350
WANTED ALMOST A RISK. THOSE WHO

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.952
ARE ALLOCATING THOSE GRANTS ARE

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:04.054
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO TED

00:47:04.121 --> 00:47:05.222
TALLY KATE THEM A TARGET THEM

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:06.590
IN THAT FASHION SO CERTAINLY

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:07.224
OPEN TO HEARING PEOPLE'S

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:09.059
CONCERNS. BUT AGAIN HERE THAT

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:10.260
THE ISSUE IS NOT WANTING TO

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.628
CREATE UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.030
OBSTACLES THAT WOULD PREVENT

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:17.134
REALLY POWERFUL PARTNERSHIPS.

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:17.768
THAT WOULD LEVERAGE OUR DOLLARS

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:18.402
AND MAKE THEM GO FURTHER. THANK

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:19.369

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:28.445
CONVERSATION A COUPLE QUESTIONS

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.881
FOR SOME OF THE WITNESSES- OR

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:33.684

FIRST TO MISTER HARD DOWN- TO

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.958
SASHA I KNOW CALIFORNIA WE'VE

00:47:41.024 --> 00:47:42.192
FUNDED EVICTION OFFENSE IN THE

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.261
PAST. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:46.630
THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM. HAS

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:48.065
LEARNED LESSONS FROM THE PAST

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:49.032
IS BUILDING ON THOSE

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.000
INVESTMENTS WONDER IF YOU COULD

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:52.302
TALK ABOUT- EXACTLY THE

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:54.738
MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS WILL BE

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:55.305
A BETTER APPROACH THAN PAST

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:59.543
APPROACHES. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:02.246
QUESTION- IT'S TRUE THAT WE

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:03.947
HAVE FUNDED LEGAL RESOURCES FOR

00:48:04.014 --> 00:48:05.882
TENANTS FACING EVICTION IN THE

00:48:05.949 --> 00:48:08.719
PAST- AND PASS PROGRAMS WHILE

00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:11.088
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- HAVE

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:12.656
STARTED. REALLY AT THE POINT AT

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:14.157
WHICH THAT KIND OF GETS COURT

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:16.159
PAPERS AND SO AT THAT POINT.

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.894
YOU KNOW PAPERS HAVE BEEN FILED

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:19.329
CASES ARE HARDER TO RESOLVE

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.831
PARTIES HAVE SPENT MONEY ON

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:23.133
FILING FEES AND THE LIKE- AND

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.001
THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BILL

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:26.536
IS IT REALLY ENCOURAGES AND

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:28.038
SORT OF LEVERAGES. ASSEMBLY

00:48:28.105 --> 00:48:29.306
MEMBER SET THESE PARTNERSHIPS

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:31.174
BETWEEN LEGAL A LOCAL

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.609
GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY BASED

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.177
ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT WE CAN DO

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:36.480
THE OPERATION EDUCATION- AND

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.848
REACH TENANTS FURTHER UPSTREAM

00:48:37.914 --> 00:48:40.250
IN THE PROCESS- BEFORE EVICTION

00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:42.719
CASES OR EVEN FILE- BUT THE

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:43.754
SENSE OF THE MODEL THAT WE

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.756
HAVE. IN PLACE IN LA WHICH WE

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:49.493
ARE TRYING TO EXPAND. AND BUILD

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:51.261
ON- WHICH IS THE NINE TO ALLOW

00:48:51.328 --> 00:48:53.030
TO WILL WITH. NEIGHBORHOOD

00:48:53.096 --> 00:48:55.065
GROUPS AND THE COUNTY TO DO THE

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:56.466
AVERAGE IN A WAY THAT'S BOTH

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:57.634
SORT OF CULTURALLY SENSITIVE

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:59.036
AND TAILORED TO THE LOCAL

00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:01.505
COMMUNITY- IT CREATES A

00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:02.906
CONTINUUM OF RESOURCES BUT

00:49:02.973 --> 00:49:03.840
LET'S ATTORNEYS SORT OF

00:49:03.907 --> 00:49:05.575
RESOLVED. CASES THAT DO GO TO

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:08.011
COURT MORE EFFECTIVELY- AT THE

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:11.648
SAME TIME AVOIDING. SCRIPTED

00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:14.017
PREVENTABLE CASES. THANK YOU-

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.285
AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:16.386
THE OPPOSITION AND THIS IS A

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.721
TOPIC OF DISCUSSED WITH THAT

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.489
WITH BOTH CA AND CA ARE OVER

00:49:19.556 --> 00:49:21.091
THE YEARS. I KNOW THIS BILL

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:22.526
DOESN'T CHANGE THE RIGHTS OR

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:24.161
DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO TENANTS

00:49:24.227 --> 00:49:25.762
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE RIGHTS OF

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:26.930
LANDLORDS TO EVICT TENANTS

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.832
UNDER. A VARIETY OF

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:29.733
CIRCUMSTANCES OR WHAT THEY

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.536
MIGHT DO- BEFORE BEING ABLE TO

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:33.837
EVICT A TENANT AND YOU KNOW

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.072
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK FOR

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:36.740
MANY OF OUR PERSPECTIVES. WE

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:39.910
THINK THAT- ENSURING THAT-

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:42.145
TENANTS ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:43.580
THE RIGHTS THEY HAVE A

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.382
PARTICULAR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE-

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:47.784
MAKES A TON OF SENSE. WE ALSO

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:50.587
KNOW THE STATISTIC THAT NGUYEN

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:52.356
ATTENDANT IS REPRESENTED THERE

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:52.989
ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO RECEIVE

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.459
A BETTER RESULT. AND THIS IS

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:57.561
THE STATISTIC THAT REALLY. I

00:49:57.627 --> 00:50:00.630
THINK IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT

00:50:00.697 --> 00:50:01.198
WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:03.433
HERE. IT'S ESTIMATED NATIONALLY

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.034
THAT 90% OF ALL LANDLORDS ARE

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:06.169
REPRESENTED. WHERE IS THE FLIP

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:08.372
SIDE 90% OF TENANTS ARE

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.540
UNREPRESENTED AND SO MY

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:12.876
QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION IS

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:16.079
YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT- THAT-

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:17.981
THAT THAT THAT THE SITUATION

00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:20.817
THE STATUS QUO IS OKAY- AND IF

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.853
YOU DON'T THINK THAT. DO YOU

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:23.854
HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF HOW WE

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:25.856
WOULD ENSURE THAT TENANTS ARE A

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.224
REPRESENTED BECAUSE IT IT IT

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:29.192
DOES SEEM THAT THE PERSPECTIVE

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:31.128
OF THE INDUSTRY IS THAT THE

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.997
STATUS QUO SHOULD REMAIN- AND

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:35.532
TENANTS SHOULD REMAIN ON

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:37.267
REPRESENTED DURING THIS PROCESS

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.403
I WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND IF

00:50:39.469 --> 00:50:40.504
YOU A DIFFERENT WAY OF HOW WE

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.606
GO ABOUT- ENSURING

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:45.275
REPRESENTATION AND REALLY- IT.

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:48.245
EQUAL FOOTING IN THE COURTS.

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.013
THANK YOU MISTER TO ADD

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.314
DIFFICULTY WITH A CALIFORNIA

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:53.483
APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AS I

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:55.619
STATED IN THE BEGINNING OF. MY

00:50:55.685 --> 00:50:57.187
STATEMENT WE DON'T OBJECT TO

00:50:57.254 --> 00:50:58.789
THE IDEA THAT LOW INCOME

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.590
TENANTS HAVE REPRESENTATION-

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:02.159
ESPECIALLY FOR A LEGITIMATE

00:51:02.225 --> 00:51:03.660
DEFENSE WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:06.897
FIGURE OUT. IS HOW TO WE AVOID

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:09.366
SOME OF THESE- MOTIONS THAT ARE

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:12.002
ACTUALLY JUST A DELAY AND I GET

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:14.404
IT THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO-

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:15.505
YOU KNOW WE HAVE MEDIATION

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:18.008
PROGRAMS IN SOME AREAS. AND IF

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.076
IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT DELAY-

00:51:20.143 --> 00:51:21.511
KEEPING TENANTS IN PLACE

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:23.313
WOULDN'T A BETTER RESULT BE TO

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.549
TRY TO FIND A WAY TO. KEEP

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:28.151
TENANTS HOUSE PERMANENTLY- WITH

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:29.519
RED DOLLARS LIKE WHAT WE HAVE

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:32.722
DONE WITH- SB NINETY ONE-

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:34.157
INSTEAD OF MILLIONS AND

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:35.926
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS JUST. TO

00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:37.127
TIE UP THE COURT SYSTEMS WE

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:39.029
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.997
TO USE THE COURT SYSTEM. BUT A

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.833
BETTER RESULT COULD VERY WELL

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.601
BE EITHER MEDIATION AND OR

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:50.974
FINDING. A DOLLARS- FOR TENANTS.

00:51:51.041 --> 00:51:51.541
TO PAY THE RENT LIKE WE DID

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:52.742
WITH SB NINETY ONE. I THINK

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.044
THIS IS GONNA CERTAINLY BE AN

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.012
ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT YOU

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:58.381
KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- OUR

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:01.418
SOCIETY WE HAVE AGREED THAT IF

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:03.720
YOU SHOPLIFT A TOOTHBRUSH FROM

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.155
<u>ALGREENS THAT YOU GET</u>

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.057
REPRESENTATION BUT IF YOU HAVE.

00:52:07.123 --> 00:52:09.493
LIVED IN YOUR HOME FOR DECADES-

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:10.627
AND BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.796
YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB- YOU CAN

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:14.431
GET KICKED TO THE CURB AND- AND

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.866
FORCED INTO HOMELESSNESS AND-

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:18.335
AND SO IT JUST. STRIKES ME THAT

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:19.669
THAT FIGURE OUT THIS BALANCE OF

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:20.837
HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.405
REPRESENTED MAKES SENSE I

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.139
CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE

UNETHICAL TENDED ATTORNEYS I

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:27.911
THINK- WE COULD PROBABLY TRY

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.779
OUT JUST AS MANY EXAMPLES OF

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:31.848
UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR ON THE PART

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:33.917
OF CERTAIN LANDLORD ATTORNEYS-

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.519
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'VE

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:36.386
GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE

00:52:36.453 --> 00:52:38.788
SURE THAT- THAT JUST AS

00:52:38.855 --> 00:52:39.990
LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED

00:52:40.056 --> 00:52:40.857

PROGRAM IN THIS LANDLORD TENANT

00:52:47.531 --> 00:52:49.299
CONTEXT AND IT HAS TURNED OUT

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:51.735
TO BE BOTH COST EFFECTIVE AND-

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:55.105

WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IN OUR CITY-

00:53:03.046 --> 00:53:04.781
BUT WE KNOW THAT- THERE ARE

00:53:04.848 --> 00:53:07.050
LITERALLY- IT TENS OF THOUSANDS

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:09.052
OF TENANTS. EVERY DAY WHO DO

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:11.388

THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:33.643
TO BE REPRESENTED AB WHAT THAT-

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.045
I DO HOPE THIS MEASURE PASSES

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:36.513
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND- WE

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.247

SOMEONE THAT'S REPRESENTED

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:56.600
TENANTS IN LANDLORD TENANT

00:53:56.666 --> 00:54:00.637
COURT- I COMPLETELY AGREE-

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:03.306
THAT- THE NATURE OF WHAT A

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:05.442
TENANT FACES. THIS IS NOT AN

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:06.977
ORDINARY CONTRACT THIS IS THEIR

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:08.845
HOME. AND I THINK THAT THEY

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.480
THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:12.182

MINUTE IN THIS IMBALANCE OF

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:19.189
POWER REPRESENTATION- IS UNJUST

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:20.790
AND I THINK THERE IS A BALANCE

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:21.992
THAT WE CAN FIND TO MAKE SURE

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:25.061
THAT- WE'RE NOT UP IN ANY WAY.

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.830
FEEDING INTO SOME UNSCRUPULOUS

OTHERS THAT DO THAT WORK BUT

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:36.873
MANY OF WHICH WORK FOR. LAW

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:39.242
SCHOOL CLINICS OR NON PROFITS

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:41.044
ARE DOING THE WORK- MOST OF

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:42.412
THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY THAT

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.413
REPRESENTING TENANTS ARE ARE

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.815

OPPOSITION TESTIMONY IT IT'S

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.501
INTERESTING HOW UNETHICAL

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.969
ATTORNEYS KIND OF ROLLS OFF THE

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:08.038
TONGUE BUT IN A COMMITTEE LIKE

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:09.472
THIS WHICH IS MOSTLY ATTORNEYS

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.675
WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:14.244
MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS. ETHICAL

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.514
BEHAVIOR AND I'M ALSO STRUCK BY

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.683
THE COMPLAINT THAT A LOT OF THE

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.184
PLEADINGS ARE DONE FOR ME

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:23.420
LATELY AND DONE INFORMS. THAT'S

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:24.821
JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.856
OF THEM THAT IT'S AN EFFICIENCY

00:55:26.923 --> 00:55:29.659
MEASURE WHICH IS WHY LEASES.

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:33.229
MOST DOCUMENTS IN REAL ESTATE

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.831
TRANSACTIONS ARE ALSO DONE ON

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:35.899
PRE PRINTED FORMS BECAUSE

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.934
THEY'RE IT'S AN EFFICIENT WAY

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:39.202
OF DOING BUSINESS THAT THAT'S

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.472
HARDLY A COMPLAINT HERE. AND

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:45.341
SOME OF WHAT WAS. MENTIONED ARE

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.443
POTENTIALLY GROUNDS FOR

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:48.211
MALPRACTICE SO THERE ARE

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.979
MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS

00:55:50.046 --> 00:55:51.347
IT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE REASON

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:52.415
AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS LONG

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:54.084
STOOD UP. FOR THE NEED FOR

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.152
FUNDING LEGAL SERVICES AT IT

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:57.887
HAS BEEN WOEFULLY INADEQUATE

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:59.022
OVER THE YEARS AND WITH THE

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:00.056
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION

00:56:00.123 --> 00:56:02.492
SERIOUSLY CUTTING BACK. FUNDING

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.094
FOR LEGAL SERVICES THIS WILL

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.529
REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:08.565
THIS COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:09.432
FORWARD AS WELL AS BUDGETS OF

00:56:09.499 --> 00:56:11.868
FIVE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:13.937
ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS ABOUT

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:15.004
GETTING AN ATTORNEY IN

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:16.473
APPROPRIATE PLACES WHICH IS WHY

00:56:16.539 --> 00:56:17.741

THE OPPOSITION IF THERE ARE

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:32.689
WAYS THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN

00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:33.923
THIS PROPOSAL MAKE IT WORK FOR

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.291
EVERYBODY I'M CERTAINLY VERY

LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.362
CONVERSATIONS. I DID WANT TO

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:40.697
NOTICE AS THE CHAIR NOTED YOU

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.365
KNOW THE ARGUMENTS. AGAINST

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:43.700
THIS PROGRAM ARE ARE REALLY

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:45.535
EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO EVERY

00:56:45.602 --> 00:56:46.803
EVERY SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE'S

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.871
REPRESENTED AN ATTORNEY EVERY

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:48.738
CASE THAT I HANDLED AS AN

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:50.173
ATTORNEY IN PRIVATE PRACTICE.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.374
THERE'S A DISPUTE ABOUT THE

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:52.642
SCOPE OF DISCOVERY ONE SIDE OR

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.010
THE OTHER IS Q. THE OTHER SIDE

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:56.012
OF TRYING TO DELAY THE PROCESS.

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.781
SO TO ME THOSE ARE ISSUES ABOUT

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.916
OUR CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND

00:56:59.983 --> 00:57:01.284
THE RULES OF JUDICIAL

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:03.520
MINISTRATION AND NOT SPECIFIC.

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:04.621
TO THIS PROGRAM A PART OF WHAT

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:06.289
I THINK CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.590
THE OPPOSITION IS ONE OF THE

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:11.094
EXAMPLES THAT THEY GAVE OF A

00:57:11.161 --> 00:57:11.694
DELAY TACTIC WAS REQUESTING A

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.163
JURY TRIAL. THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:13.630
TO THAT'S ONE OF THE

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:14.864
FUNDAMENTAL DEFINING FEATURES

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.199
OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IF YOU

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.600
LOOK AT ARTICLE ONE SECTION

00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:18.134
SIXTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.069
CONSTITUTION IT TALKS ABOUT.

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:21.304
THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO TRIAL

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.039
BY JURY. SO THESE ARE NOTIONS

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.340
THAT ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN OUR

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:25.942
IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.544
AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:28.545

00:57:28.611 --> 00:57:30.313
ABOUT FOLKS EXERCISING

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:30.847
FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:32.549

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.145
SO THEY HAD THAT INFORMATION

01:11:56.211 --> 01:11:59.148
AND THEY KNEW HOW TO GET THAT

01:11:59.214 --> 01:11:59.682
PAYMENT PLAN THEY WOULD BE

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:01.717
GREATLY BENEFITED. OKAY I GUESS

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:03.686
I BELIEVE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:06.021
NOW RELEASED AS OF. THIS YEAR

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:07.723
LAST YEAR YOUR ACTION REQUIRED

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:09.358
TO BE INSURED AND IF YOU DON'T

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:10.626
GET INSURANCE THEN YOU'RE-

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:12.928
PENALIZED- FOR THAT BUT THEN WE

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.797
ALSO HAVE A POLICY WHERE YOUR-

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:18.067
GIVEN- REDUCED- YOU KNOW COSTS

01:12:18.133 --> 01:12:19.902
IF YOU. ARE NOT FOLLOWING THAT

01:12:19.968 --> 01:12:21.270
MANDATE AND GO TO THE HOSPITAL

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:22.905
SERVICES COULD TRYING TO GET MY

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.074
MIND OR HOW HOW THESE POLICIES

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.076
SORT OF IT TOGETHER. WELL I CAN

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.444
CERTAINLY CAN SPEECH EVERY CASE

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.712
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.280
THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:33.115
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE.

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.149
AT THEIR HEALTHCARE THAT'S

01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.451
EXCESSIVE THAT'S THE PORTABLE

01:12:35.517 --> 01:12:36.985
FOR THEM- OR THAT THEY'RE

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:38.087
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OR

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.555
MEDICAID ALL. AND SOMETIMES

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:40.189
IT'S A QUESTION OF THE

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:41.523
HOSPITALS PROVIDING INFORMATION

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.958
HELPING THEM SIGN UP AND THAT'S

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:43.792
SOMETHING THAT MANY OF THESE

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:45.027
HOSPITALS ARE NOT DOING.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:45.728
THEY'RE NOT HELPING THEM

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.196
NAVIGATE THAT SYSTEM TO GET

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.498
THEM TO GET THE INSURANCE- BUT

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:52.434
IT IF YOU'RE ASK AT SO. AS TO

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.036
WHY SOMEBODY MIGHT KNOW ABOUT

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:56.138
INSURANCE. AND NOT HAVE IT

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.639
SOMETIMES THEY MAYBE FEEL THEY

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.808
CAN'T AFFORD IT- EVEN WITH THE

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.910
SUBSIDIES- I HAVE FOUND JUST

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:03.879
ANECDOTALLY THAT WHEN I'VE TOLD

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.347
PEOPLE ABOUT THE SUBSIDIES ARE

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.782
AVAILABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA A

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:08.450
LOT OF PM PEOPLE HAD NO IDEA.

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:09.518
THEY HAD NO IDEA THE AMOUNT OF

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:10.953
SUBSIDY AND THAT THE BUT THERE

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:11.754
IS INSURANCE OUT THERE THAT

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:12.888
THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT'S

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.523
AFFORDABLE. SO I THINK THOSE

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:15.324
ARE SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WHO

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:17.860
FIND THEIR WAY. INTO THE

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.161
SITUATION. BUT I'M JUST

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:20.395
GUESSING I. I DON'T HAVE THE

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.330
ONE ON ONE EXPERIENCE THAT

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.698
WESTERN CENTER MIGHT HAVE THEY

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:23.232
MIGHT GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:25.200
ANSWER. YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.902
TO ME DID YOU WANT TO ADD

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:27.503
ANYTHING OTHER WHEN THE SUN ON

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:31.039
THE PHONE. AT I WOULD SAY ALL

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:32.508
OF THOSE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:33.709
TRUE AND THEN EVEN FOR PEOPLE

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:35.677
WHO ARE INSURED YOU KNOW WHEN

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:36.712
THEY LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEY

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:37.746
LOSE THEIR INSURANCE IT CAN

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:39.448
TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY GET

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:42.184
INTO A NEW PROGRAM. OKAY LET'S

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.285

KNOW WE'RE PROVIDING THIS-

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:49.858
RELIEF BUT THEN AT THE SAME

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:51.226
TIME WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.394
FINANCIALLY PUNISHING THESE

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.229
VERY SAME PEOPLE- IF THEY DON'T

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.364
COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S MANDATE

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.765
SO THAT MAYBE SOMEONE WILL LOOK

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.233
AT SOME POINT. THANK YOU THANKS

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.768
FOR THE QUESTION. WELL WE ALSO

01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:01.603
KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE IS

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:02.171
A MANDATE WE KNOW THAT THERE

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:04.807
ARE. THAT WE'RE NOT COVERING

01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:06.108
THREE OR FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:08.410
CALIFORNIA SO. THERE IS NOT

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.379
COMPLETE COVERAGE. FOR THE

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.113
GOVERNOR WHO MAY BE SUBJECT TO

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:13.182

YEARS AGO PRETTY GOOD INSURANCE

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:17.419
PLAN AND WHEN I WENT WENT

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:18.987
THROUGH A YEAR OF CHEMOTHERAPY

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:19.721
I ENDED UP WITH TEN THOUSAND

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.857
DOLLARS IN DEBT. AND IT WAS NOT

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.525
POSSIBLE IT IS REALLY HARD FOR

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.060
ME TO PAY THAT SO EVEN PEOPLE

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.564
THAT HAVE SUPPOSEDLY GOOD

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.164
INSURANCE GOING VERY HIGH OUT

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.899
OF POCKET COSTS. IT'S A TRAP.

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:32.835
IT OUT. I JUST WANT TO GAUGE

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.503
SIZE AND THE- OF THE PROBLEM.

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:35.971
NOW IF- MAYBE A COUPLE OF

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.040
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR THE-

01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:40.742

VERY SIMILAR IN- HOW THEY ARE

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.374
BOTH PROVIDING CHARITY CARE AND

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.942
THE AMOUNT OF CHARITY CARE THAT

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.277
THEY'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE.

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:50.345

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:17.940
PENALTY. PART OF THE SCHOOL

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:29.885
WILL BE THAT'S. WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:30.385
TALKING TO THE HOSPITAL

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:30.919

HAVE A REAL READ TO FOLLOW THE

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:32.788
LAW- YOU KNOW THAT HAVE ENOUGH

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:33.388
OF. TO MAKE THEM THINK TWICE-

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:34.790
AND TO SET UP. A FULL IN THEIR

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:35.424
OWN HOSPITALS COMPLY TO REALLY

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:36.024
SURE THAT THIS AND- IS BEING

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.659
PER. TO PAY PATIENTS. OUR GOAL

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:38.627
IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE IT'S

01:16:38.694 --> 01:16:40.028
REALLY TO GET THE HOSPITAL'S

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:42.230
INTO COMPLIANCE. IN AND I

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:43.565
UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN ON

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:45.300
THAT ALSO DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:46.601
WHAT KIND OF PENALTY WOULD BE

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.503
AND- IF SO WHERE DOES THAT

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:49.871
PENALTY GOING HOUSE TO BE USED.

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.239
WE'RE LOOKING AT A SLIDING

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:52.341
SCALE SO THE FIRST OFFENSE OF

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:54.009
COURSE WOULD BE MUCH LOWER AND

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:54.943
THEN THE MAXIMUM OFFENSE WORD

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.111
WORLD TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:57.913
AROUND THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.348
DOLLAR MARK. AND I WILL JUST

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.149
SAY THAT IT'S HARD TO PUT A

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:02.918
PENALTY NUMBER ON AN ACTION

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:04.086
THAT COULD LITERALLY RUIN

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.654
SOMEONE'S LIFE. I WANT A

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:06.588
PATIENT FEELS THAT THEY'D

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.156
RATHER BE DEAD. THAN PUT THEIR

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:11.259
FAMILY THROUGH- ECONOMIC RUIN-

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:12.995
IF SOMEONE'S HOUSE IS TAKEN

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:14.329
AWAY IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO GET

01:17:14.396 --> 01:17:16.198
A JOB IF THEY CAN'T GET A LOAN

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:18.066
ANYMORE FOR THEIR CHILD-

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.534
BECAUSE OF MEDICAL THAT THEY

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:20.268
SHOULDN'T OF ACCRUED IN THE

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.470
FIRST PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:22.838
WHAT THE FAIR NUMBER IS FOR THE

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:25.173
HOSPITAL. BUT THAT'S WE'RE

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:25.707
WORKING WITH THE HOSPITAL

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:27.542
ASSOCIATION ON AN AD I THINK

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.378
THAT'S MY CONCERN IS YOU KNOW

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:31.313
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES- SO

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.048
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU KNOW A FINE

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:34.182
COME AGAINST SOMEONE THAT

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:35.317
ACCIDENTALLY MADE A MISTAKE

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.151
WHEN THEY WERE BILLING

01:17:36.218 --> 01:17:38.120
SOMETHING- AND- YOU KNOW IF

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:38.820
THEY DO ACTUALLY HAVE AN

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.390
OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL- TO BE

01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:42.391
ABLE TO PROVE THAT YOU KNOW IT

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:44.960
WASN'T. INTENTIONAL I TOTALLY

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:45.961
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN AND I

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.429
AGREE WITH YOU- SOMETIMES

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.296
THINGS SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:49.731
BUT IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:50.365
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:51.466
WHEN YOU'RE JUST IN YOUR

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.168
NONPROFIT HOSPITAL SECTOR. THIS

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.069
IS SOMETHING THAT WAS STILL

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:55.537
CLEARLY THE HOSPITALS NEED TO

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:56.471
SYSTEMICALLY LOOK AT THE

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:59.074
PROCESSES. AND SO. IT'S HOW IT

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.308
LOOKS TO ME IS THAT THEY DON'T

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.745
HAVE THE RIGHT MECHANISMS JUST-IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:04.446
EVERY SINGLE PATIENT WHO

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.415
DESERVES- THIS RELIEF IS

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:09.017
GETTING IT. SO HOPEFULLY THIS

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.685
WILL PUSH THEM TO SET UP THOSE

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:15.357
MUCH MORE. ROBUST SORTS OF

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:15.957
PROCEDURES AND MAKE THE IT'S

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:16.591
MUCH MORE ROUTINE. FOR THEM TO

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:18.393
CHECK FOR. THE SAME WITHOUT. IF

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.127
YOU HAVE A FEVER IF YOU HAVE AN

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.062
INFECTION BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.463
HOSPITAL THEY SHOULD BE

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.064
CHECKING TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.965
PAY YOUR BILLS. AND FORGIVE ME

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:25.133
IF YOU'VE YOU'VE ANSWERED THIS

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.069

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:29.404
WOULD THIS PENALTY GO TO- THAT

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.705
I BELIEVE WOULD PROBABLY. YOU

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.640
KNOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO DOUBLE

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:33.175
CHECK WHAT'S IN THE TEXT OF THE

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.042
BILL BUT I'M ASSUMING IT WOULD

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.644
GO TO THE AGENCIES THE WAY THAT

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.446

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:49.458
LEGISLATORS WHO STOOD UP TO END

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.993
SURPRISE BILLING- YOU KNOW WHEN

01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:53.028

CONCERNED ABOUT. HOSPITAL DEBT

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.504
I THINK THER NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.006
TRANSPARENCY IN PRICING- WHEN

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:07.142

FOR ME ON. ON THIS PARTICULAR

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:09.711
ISSUE I THINK. THERE'S ALREADY

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.246
A LOT OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:12.714

01:19:25.994 --> 01:19:28.029
ADDS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION-

01:19:28.096 --> 01:19:29.297
WHICH WE KNOW WILL AGAIN BE A

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:31.700
TOOL FOR. ATTORNEYS TO SUE

01:19:31.766 --> 01:19:33.768
HOSPITALS- TO COST SOME

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:36.538

THEY EXIST. IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:31.987

PROTECTIONS IF THEY DON'T DO

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:54.142
THAT THE PROTECTIONS BECOME

01:21:54.209 --> 01:21:55.977
IRRELEVANT. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.712

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.981

A RECENT CASE- IN THE LA AREA

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:13.599
WHERE A STUDENT WAS SEXUALLY

ADVANCE AND I BELIEVE IT'S

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:59.479
UNCONSCIONABLE- TO FORCE THE

01:56:59.545 --> 01:57:01.280

ABILITY OF STATES- TO REGULATE

THE ISSUE. HOWEVER I BELIEVE-

01:57:20.166 --> 01:57:22.034
THAT- THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS

01:57:22.101 --> 01:57:23.836

PROBLEMATIC FOR SCHOOL

ASSAULT. CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES

02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:57.116
IT CLEAR THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN

02:00:57.183 --> 02:00:59.485
DECIDE A MATTER BEFORE THAT NOT

02:00:59.552 --> 02:01:01.187
ON THE BASIS OF THE LAW OR THE

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.989

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.357
SOLELY ON AMBIGUOUS NOTIONS OF

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:06.258
EQUITY AS PERCEIVED BY THAT

02:01:06.325 --> 02:01:07.827

BIASES AND PRECONCEPTIONS. THAT

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:12.665
MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:14.400
BLATANTLY IGNORE THE LAW AND

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:15.167
PREVENT THE STUDENT WHO WAS

02:01:18.237 --> 02:01:20.940
COURTS. AB TWO SEVENTY TWO

02:01:21.007 --> 02:01:22.074
EXPECT THAT PROBLEM BY ALLOWING

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.476
STUDENTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:24.910
ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT AFTER

BEING THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL

02:01:25.978 --> 02:01:27.947
ASSAULT. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:29.515
THAT AB TWO SEVENTY TWO HAS A

02:01:29.582 --> 02:01:30.916
VERY NARROW SCOPE IT'S

02:01:30.983 --> 02:01:32.318
PROVISIONS ARE ONLY TRIGGERED

02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:33.519

QUITE. CALIFORNIA CAN FIX THIS

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:39.725
LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWED COUNT

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:41.594
THAT ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO EDUCATE

OUR SCHOOL. THIS HAS NOT BEEN A

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:28.074
PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE. AMONG

MANY WOULD PREFER THIS ISSUE

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:34.346
NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY.

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:36.015
THERE ARE FEW THINGS WORSE THAN

02:02:36.082 --> 02:02:37.783
HARMING A CHILD ONE THING I

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.884
KNOW WITH WORK IS PREVENTING

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.553
THAT CHARLTON SEEKING JUSTICE

02:02:40.619 --> 02:02:42.521
FOR THAT HARM. IGNORING THAT IT

02:02:42.588 --> 02:02:44.957
EVER HAPPENED. FOUR YEARS AGO

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:46.659
ARCHIBALD WAS REPEATEDLY AND

02:02:46.726 --> 02:02:48.694

NEARLY EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:54.133
MONTHS BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:56.001
THE PERPETRATOR WAS CRIMINALLY

02:02:56.068 --> 02:02:58.237
CONVICTED AND SERVED TIME. ARTS

02:03:00.372 --> 02:03:01.741
DAMAGES GUARD BY THIS YEAR

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:03.642
BECAUSE I THOUGHT. THE ANGUISH

02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:05.144
PAIN AND MISERY COUPLED WITH

02:03:05.211 --> 02:03:07.146
THE LOSS OF INNOCENT HAVE BEEN

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:09.014
AND CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING.

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:11.150
HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT OUR

LAST YEAR TOO I THINK WE NOTED

02:10:05.063 --> 02:10:06.965
THAT. I CERTAINLY WISH YOU

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.167
SUCCESS WITH THIS WE'VE BEEN

02:10:08.233 --> 02:10:11.103
LONG PROBING. THE BOUNDARIES OF

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:12.604
ARBITRATION WHICH DO END UP

02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:13.772
WITH SOME PRETTY UNCONSCIONABLE

02:10:13.839 --> 02:10:16.141
RESULTS AND IF THIS IS A PATH

02:10:16.208 --> 02:10:18.777
TO HELPING. DELINEATE HOW WE

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:20.846
CAN BETTER THINK OF WHERE A

02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:22.447
STATE MAY ENTER THIS

02:10:22.514 --> 02:10:25.150
CONVERSATION- THE BETTER OFF I

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:27.252
THINK WE ALL ARE SO I AM VERY

02:10:27.319 --> 02:10:28.954
HOPEFUL THAT. THIS BILL WILL BE

02:10:29.021 --> 02:10:30.389
ABLE TO HELP ESTABLISH SOME OF

02:10:30.455 --> 02:10:32.391
THOSE BOUNDS. AS AS WELL AS A

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:34.893
POINTS OUT. THE WE'VE ALSO.

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.061
DONE WORK AROUND SECRET

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:37.229
SETTLEMENTS IN THIS LEGISLATURE

02:10:37.296 --> 02:10:39.364
AND TRIED BECAUSE OF THE

02:10:39.431 --> 02:10:41.500
DETRIMENTAL EFFECT OF. KEEPING

02:10:41.567 --> 02:10:42.935
THAT INFORMATION AWAY FROM THE

02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:46.004
PUBLIC WHO NEED TO BE AWARE OF

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.140
THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE.

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:49.508
SETTLEMENTS ARE HAPPENING AND

02:10:49.575 --> 02:10:51.210
HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:53.178
AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC THEN NOT

02:10:53.245 --> 02:10:54.880
ALERTING THE PUBLIC OF THE

02:10:54.947 --> 02:10:55.614
DANGERS OF A PARTICULAR

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:58.350
SITUATION SO. I CERTAINLY WISH

02:10:58.417 --> 02:11:00.252
YOU WELL WITH THIS BILL AND-

02:11:00.319 --> 02:11:02.554
HOPE THAT IT WILL MOVE OTHER

02:11:02.621 --> 02:11:04.389
QUESTIONS COMMENTS AMID

02:11:04.456 --> 02:11:08.060
GONZALEZ. GRAYSON KALRA. I JUST

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:11.463
WANNA AGREE WITH THE CHAIR- I

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:13.031
THINK WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:11:13.098 --> 02:11:14.566
ON I'M ON RECORD THOUGH THAT I

02:11:14.633 --> 02:11:16.735
DISAGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT

02:11:16.802 --> 02:11:19.171
THIS IS- UNIQUE ONLY TO SCHOOLS

02:11:19.238 --> 02:11:20.706
AND CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT.

02:11:20.772 --> 02:11:23.308
ALTHOUGH IT IS- DEPLORABLE IN

02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:26.078
PROBABLY THE MOST. EGREGIOUS OF

02:11:26.144 --> 02:11:30.249
CASES- ARBITRATION HIDES SERIAL

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:31.850
ABUSERS IN EVERY FORM IN THE

02:11:31.917 --> 02:11:33.852
WORK PLACE IN SCHOOLS AND

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:36.455
ORGANIZATIONS AND IT IT BRINGS

02:11:36.521 --> 02:11:38.423
TO LIGHT. EXACTLY WHY

02:11:38.490 --> 02:11:40.259
ARBITRATION- CAN BE SUCH A

02:11:40.325 --> 02:11:42.060
FAILURE FOR VICTIMS THE FACT

02:11:42.127 --> 02:11:43.996
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO- AN

02:11:44.062 --> 02:11:45.197
ARBITRATOR DOES NOT HAVE TO

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:46.531
BASE THEIR DECISION ON LAW IT

02:11:46.598 --> 02:11:47.833
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:11:47.899 --> 02:11:49.935
SHOULD ALL BE SHOCKED ABOUT. NO

02:11:50.002 --> 02:11:51.803
MATTER WHAT THE CLAIM IS AND SO

02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:53.305
AS SOMEBODY WHO OBVIOUSLY HAS

02:11:53.372 --> 02:11:55.173
DONE BILLS- BOTH ON ARBITRATION

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:57.676
AND EXTENDING THE TIME LIMIT

02:11:57.743 --> 02:11:59.444
FOR- INDIVIDUALS TO PURSUE

02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:00.279
CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT

02:12:00.345 --> 02:12:03.482
CLAIMS. THAT UP I WOULD LIKE

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:04.816
COOPER THIS BILL I OF COURSE

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:08.086
SUPPORTED- I'LL MOVE IT BUT I

02:12:08.153 --> 02:12:09.655
ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:10.689
EVERYTHING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:15.694
TODAY- IN RESPONSE TO THIS.

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.996
POOR CHILD- AND- INABILITY TO

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:19.431
GET JUSTICE COULD COULD BE

02:12:19.498 --> 02:12:21.633
MAGNIFIED BY. A WOMAN IN THE

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.035
WORKPLACE COULD BE MAGNIFIED

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:26.505
BY- YOU KNOW OTHER CHILDREN AT

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:28.974
OTHER ACTIVITIES- OR OR EVEN

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:31.677
ADULTS AND SO I JUST I THINK

02:12:31.743 --> 02:12:32.778
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:12:32.844 --> 02:12:33.745
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THAT

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:36.048
THAT- I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING

02:12:36.114 --> 02:12:37.182

STAND UP TO TRADITIONAL

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:40.285

VISCERAL. EMOTION WE HEAR ABOUT

ESPECIALLY- IT KINDA

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:34.759
EMOTIONALLY. AIM FOR A I THINK

THAT. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE

02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:38.964
ONE INDIVIDUAL VICTIM BUT THE

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:42.334
REALITY IS THAT. BY NOT

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:45.370
ALLOWING. THESE THESE INSIDIOUS

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:48.640
SITUATIONS TO- REPETITIVE TO

02:15:48.707 --> 02:15:50.642
HAVE SUNLIGHT SHINED ON THEM.

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.777
YOUR ALLOWING CONDUCT IN THESE

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.112
INSTITUTIONS TO CONTINUE IN

MANY CASES FOR MANY MANY YEARS

02:15:56.381 --> 02:15:58.683
WITH MANY MANY VICTIMS. AND SO

02:15:58.750 --> 02:16:01.219
THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TRY TO NOT

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:04.155
ONLY BRING- SOME SENSE OF

02:16:04.222 --> 02:16:05.991
JUSTICE TO AN INDIVIDUAL TO

02:16:06.057 --> 02:16:07.158
DUMP IN MANY CASES COULD

02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:08.693
PREVENT. MANY MANY OTHER

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:10.128
VICTIMS- WHEN YOU'RE NOT

02:16:10.195 --> 02:16:11.796
ALLOWING THAT SUN. TO SHINE IN

02:16:11.863 --> 02:16:14.032
SORT OF SPEAK. AND SO IN THAT

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:15.433
REGARD I THINK IT'S ALSO

02:16:15.500 --> 02:16:17.536

MANY OTHER WINDOWS- IN THIS

02:16:29.180 --> 02:16:31.216

INAPPROPRIATE THINGS UNDER THE

02:16:40.258 --> 02:16:41.560

02:17:07.185 --> 02:17:09.120
FEDERAL LEGISLATOR LEGISLATORS

02:17:09.187 --> 02:17:10.455
WERE MORE STATE LEGISLATURES

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:12.424
MAYBE WHEN MEMBERS NAY BECAUSE

02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:14.559
GO TO CONGRESS ONE DAY. THEY

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:15.727
COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT

02:17:15.794 --> 02:17:16.428
AND CHANGE THE FEDERAL

02:17:16.494 --> 02:17:17.896
ARBITRATION ACT BUT THAT IS

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:20.031
WHAT REALLY GETS IN THE WAY OF

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:21.433
BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE SUCH

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:26.304
CHANGES IT IT DOES- YOU KNOW.

02:17:26.371 --> 02:17:27.739
WE'RE SORT OF SUPERSEDED BY

02:17:27.806 --> 02:17:31.209
THAT LAW- I THINK MR KILEY HAS.

02:17:31.276 --> 02:17:33.044
DONE A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING WHY

02:17:33.111 --> 02:17:34.079
IN THIS CASE THAT WOULD NOT

02:17:34.145 --> 02:17:36.214
APPLY- MOST NOTABLY BECAUSE

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:37.549
WE'RE DEALING WITH MINORS HERE.

02:17:37.616 --> 02:17:39.150
AND THAT MINORS CANNOT SIGN

02:17:39.217 --> 02:17:42.053
AWAY THEIR RIGHTS- THAT'S VERY

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.723
CLEAR IN MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS

02:17:44.789 --> 02:17:47.926
OF THE LAW- AND- YOUR LOOK

02:17:47.993 --> 02:17:50.095
ARBITRATION I THINK. YOU KNOW

02:17:50.161 --> 02:17:50.962
PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT

02:17:51.029 --> 02:17:52.497
DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT IT BUT

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:53.431
IT THERE ARE BENEFITS STARBIRD

02:17:53.498 --> 02:17:54.933
TRADITION. IN TERMS OF

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.901
EFFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF

02:17:56.968 --> 02:17:59.671
ENSURING- QUICK ACCESS TO

02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:01.840
JUSTICE ACTUALLY BECAUSE OUR

02:18:01.906 --> 02:18:02.374
COURTS AS WE KNOW ARE NOT

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:04.376
ALWAYS SO QUICK. AND LET'S NOT

02:18:04.442 --> 02:18:06.144
SAID THEY'RE ALWAYS SUNSHINY

02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:07.746
ESPECIALLY HERE RECENTLY WHEN

02:18:07.812 --> 02:18:08.446
THEY HAVE AN EMAIL ON THE

02:18:08.513 --> 02:18:10.815
PUBLIC- AND THE MANY COURT

02:18:10.882 --> 02:18:13.284
COURT ROOMS- WHEN JURY TRIALS

02:18:13.351 --> 02:18:15.687
HAVE BEEN DELAYED- AND PEOPLE

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:17.956
HAVEN'T HAD. FOR INSTANCE QUICK

02:18:18.023 --> 02:18:20.291
JURY TRIALS- IN THE STATE LET'S

02:18:20.358 --> 02:18:21.893
NOT ACT LIKE OUR COURT SYSTEM

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:24.863
IS SO OPEN AND TRANSPARENT

02:18:24.929 --> 02:18:26.931
BECAUSE IT. IT ACTUALLY HAS NOT

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:30.969
BEEN IN MANY CASES- BUT YOU

02:18:31.036 --> 02:18:32.070
KNOW I THINK WHAT WE'RE GETTING

02:18:32.137 --> 02:18:34.005
THAT- IS THAT THE ISSUE THAT IT

02:18:34.072 --> 02:18:38.376
SEEMS UNFAIR- WHEN- ESPECIALLY

02:18:38.443 --> 02:18:39.978
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUEER SCENE

02:18:40.045 --> 02:18:41.780
SOMEONE INTO AN AGREEMENT.

02:18:41.846 --> 02:18:42.847
OFTENTIMES ARE TALKING ABOUT

02:18:42.914 --> 02:18:44.449
ADULTS YOU BECOME AN EIGHTEEN

02:18:44.516 --> 02:18:46.217
YEARS OLD YOU'RE AN ADULT. YOU

02:18:46.284 --> 02:18:47.585
CAN MAKE ADULT DECISIONS YOU

02:18:47.652 --> 02:18:48.920
CAN DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT TO

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:50.822
WORK YOU CAN DECIDE- SOME THESE

02:18:50.889 --> 02:18:52.223
DIFFERENT WHAT CONTRACTS YOU

02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.658
WANT TO ENTER INTO AND NOT

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:56.094
ENTER INTO- THAT'S A DIFFERENT

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:57.562
CONTEXT IN THE ONE THAT WE'RE

02:18:57.629 --> 02:19:00.265
DEALING WITH. RIGHT HERE- WE'RE

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:02.567
WE HAVE MINORS WHO WHO HAVE TO

02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:03.668
GO TO SCHOOL ARE LEGALLY

02:19:03.735 --> 02:19:06.771
REQUIRED TO BY THE WAY- AND WE

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:08.139
OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BE GETTING AN

02:19:08.206 --> 02:19:10.542
EDUCATION- AND THEN HAVING

02:19:10.608 --> 02:19:12.444
THIS- BE IMPOSED UPON THEM

02:19:12.510 --> 02:19:14.746
AGAINST THEIR WILL. AND AS WE

02:19:14.813 --> 02:19:15.647
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH A

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:17.449
DIFFERENT BILL PEOPLE AND POWER

02:19:17.515 --> 02:19:20.985
PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVEN POWER AND

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:23.421
STEWARDSHIP. I YOU KNOW- TO

02:19:23.488 --> 02:19:25.557
ALLOW THEM TO ABUSE THAT POWER

02:19:25.623 --> 02:19:27.625
AND THEN BASICALLY HIDE BEHIND

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:30.628
SOMETHING IS NOT OK AND I THINK

02:19:30.695 --> 02:19:31.229
WE'VE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE

02:19:31.296 --> 02:19:33.264
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LOOKING

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:34.332
AT YOU KNOW OVERWHELMINGLY

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:35.934
OBVIOUSLY OUR TEACHERS DO AN

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.069
AMAZING JOB OF PROTECTING OUR

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:40.138
KIDS OF TEACHING THEM- BUT

02:19:40.205 --> 02:19:41.873
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY EGREGIOUS

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:43.174
EXAMPLES OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE

02:19:43.241 --> 02:19:46.177
ABUSED THEIR POWER- AND HAVE

02:19:46.244 --> 02:19:48.179
VIOLATED CHILDREN'S LOT RIGHTS

02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:51.116
AND- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIDE

02:19:51.182 --> 02:19:51.750
BEHIND DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE

02:19:51.816 --> 02:19:53.818
SYSTEM. AND EVEN GOOD GET

TRANSFERRED TO OTHER PLACES

WHERE THEY CONTINUE TO DO THE

02:19:57.455 --> 02:19:59.357
SAME EXACT THING- WE'VE

02:19:59.424 --> 02:20:00.792
HIGHLIGHTED THAT IN OTHER AREAS

02:20:00.859 --> 02:20:02.060
OF OUR SOCIETY I THINK WE NEED

02:20:02.127 --> 02:20:03.962

PRIVATELY GOING TO COURT TO DO

A NAME CHANGE THAT WOULD HAVE

TO BE PUBLISHED RIGHT- SO WHY

02:27:12.323 --> 02:27:14.025
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW
