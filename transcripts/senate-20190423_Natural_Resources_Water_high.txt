RESOURCE IN WATER -- WE ARE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT SEEING AS SENATOR DODD IS HERE WOULD YOU LIKE. TO COME PRESENT YES -- APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY SIR. YOU'VE GOT A FEW MEASURES BEFORE US HERE TODAY -- ONE OF WHICH IS ON PROPOSED CONSENT. THAT'S ITEM SIX OF THIS BEFORE FOR TWO BUT THEN YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO FORTY SEVEN IN. TWO FIFTY THREE AT YOUR DISCRETION PICK WHICH EITHER ONE YOU WANT TO START WITH. WE'LL START IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU MISS CHAIRED SB. TWO FORTY SEVEN OKAY MADESS CHAIR MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. OUT AS WE ALL KNOW EXTREME WEATHER IS INCREASE THE NUMBER CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN THE LENGTH OF THE WILDFIRE SEASON. YEARS OF DROUGHT RESULTING IN MILLIONS OF DEAD TREES FOLLOWED BY SUBSTANTIAL VEGETATION GROWTH. DURING A RECORDSETTING WHAT WINNER BECAME WILDFIRE FUEL DURING RECORD SETTING HEAT VERY LOW HUMIDITY AND VERY HIGH WINDS. ACCORDING TO CAL FIRE TWELVE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WERE CAUSED BY ELECTRIC POWER AND DISTRIBUTION LINES. CONDUCTORS AND POWER POLES. CALIFORNIA -- CITED TREES ARE PART OF TREES FALLING ON THE POWER LINES AS SPECIFIC CLAUSES OF THESE FIRES. ADEQUATE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO REDUCING THE RISK OF TREES AND BRUSH CONTACT THE ELECTRICAL LINES AND EQUIPMENT. PART OF CAL FIRES MISSION IS TO PREVENT FIRES CAL FIRES FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDES WILD LAND. IN PRE FIRE -- ENGINEERING VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FIRE PLANNING EDUCATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUELY SITUATED DETERMINE WHAT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE LEVEL WILDFIRE RISKS. FROM CONTACT WITH ELECTRIC LIGHTS AND EQUIPMENT. TO ENSURE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS SUFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENTED. UNDER CURRENT LAW INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES MUST PROVIDE THE CPUC WITH THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PLAN. AS PART OF THE I. O. U. WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN. FURTHER AS PART OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN SKEWS ME FURTHER THE CPC MUST CONSULT WITH CAL FIRE WHEN REVIEWING AND APPROVING EACH WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN. HAS TO BE AMENDED SB TWO FORTY SEVEN WOULD REQUIRE CAL FIRE TO AUDIT EACH ELECT SCHOOL CORPORATIONS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK. TO ENSURE THAT THE UILITY HAS SATISFACTORILY CARRY THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK SET FORTH IN ITS WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN. WELL THIS IS MORE WORK FOR CAL FIRE CAL FIRE WOULD BE REIMBURSED BY THE UTILITY FOR ALL ITS COST INCLUDING ANY NEW RESOURCES NEEDED. SO IT'S ABILITY TO PERFORMANCE OTHER DUTIES WILL NOT. BE IMPAIRED. FINALLY BECAUSE VEGETATION MANAGER WORK IS SO IT IS VERY DANGEROUS SB TWO FORTY SEVEN ALSO REQUIRES THE BED THAT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WORK BE PERFORMED. BY QUALIFIED LIKE CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMERS OR QUALIFIED LYING CLEARANCE TREE TRIMMER TRAINEES. RECENTLY JUDGE ALSO OVERSEEING P. GENIES PROBATION IN THE SAN BRUNO CASE SAID P. JEANNIE HASN'T CUT THE RIGHT TREES IN MANAGING VEGETATION IN AND NEAR ITS POWER LINES. IN RESPONSE P. JEANNIE SAID AND I QUOTE. THERE'S A LOT OF TREES OUT THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE HIGHS ON ALL OF THEM. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I SUBMIT LET'S GIVE THE ELECTRICAL UTILITIES EYES THEY NEED TO ADEQUATELY MANAGE EDUCATION AND CUT THE RIGHT TREES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY -- ARE REPRESENTED THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOT WHICH IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK. SENATOR DODD FOR INTRODUCING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES TO SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. THE FIRST PROBLEMS TO CHAIR IS THAT. WELL THE THE LAW CURRENTLY AS IT IS IT STATES IS A VERY SUBJECTIVE. AS TO THE EXTENT OF THE TRIMMING ENTRY CLEARING THAT UTILITY MUST DO. IT STATES YOU HAVE TO CLEAR TWELVE FEET AROUND. A PIECE OF OF A LINE. BUT THEN IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT YOU MUST ALSO CLEAR. ANY TREE ON ADJACENT PROPERTY. POTENTIALLY COULD POSE A RISK. DURING CERTAIN HIGH EVENT INCIDENTS THAT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH GOING ON TO PRIVATE LANDOWNERS PROPERTY. IN CUTTING TREES THAT TO THE NAKED EYES SEEM TO BE. WELL OUTSIDE OF THE EASEMENT FOR THE TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION LINE. COMES VERY DIFFICULT. SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE HAVING CAL FIRE COME IN AFTER WE DO. OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND CLEAR THAT VEGETATION. TO COME THROUGH AND SAY YOU CAN DO BETTER JOB HERE. THAT TREE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM USING THEIR EXPERTISE IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ALL PARTIES INVOLVED. ESPECIALLY THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. NOW LET ME STATE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I CAN NEVER REMEMBER COMING FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN ADVOCATING FOR JOBS TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE I. B. W.. AND GIVEN TO SOMEBODY ELSE. CURRENTLY THE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE HIRED TO DO THIS POST. TRIMMING INSPECTION. DO SO WITH THE WORKERS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF MY UNION. WE SIMPLY DON'T THINK THAT THOSE CONTRACTORS AND THOSE WORKERS. I HAVE THE TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE CAPACITY TO DO THE VERY BEST FOR CALIFORNIANSIF YOU LOOK AT THE SEVENTEEN FIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OUTSIDE OF THE TUBS FIRE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN OF THOSE FIRES. CAL FIRE DETERMINED THAT THOSE WERE BECAUSE BECAUSE OF TREES ADJACENT TO POWER LINES. THEY WERE NOT CUT. IN THEIR OPINION TO SUFFICIENT SPECIFICATIONS. AT THIS BILL BUT IN PLACE WE THINK THAT THAT MANY OF THOSE -- INCIDENTS COULD HAVE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THE WORK FORCE TO BE REPRESENTED DO DO DO ALL THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND AND LYING TREE CLEARING. IS A PRIMARILY A MIGRANT WORKFORCE. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE SCOPE OF HOW THIS WORK FORCES BEEN RAMPED UP. IN JUST THE LAST YEAR WE'VE GONE FROM APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND MEMBERS. WORKING UNDER. CONTRACTORS WORKING FOR P. JEANNIE TO OVER. THREE THOUSAND WE HAVE CONTRACTORS LITERALLY DRIVING IN FROM OTHER STATES. WOULD TWENTY AND TWENTY FIVE TRUCKS AND NO EMPLOYEES. WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. THE SHOW UP WITH EMPLOYEES WHO THEN BECOME OUR MEMBERS. THEY FIND THEM WHEREVER THEY CAN FIND THEM HOME DEPOT WHEREVER THEY CAN. THE FEAR THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE SITUATION HAS BECOME PARALLEL TO THE SITUATION WITH FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS. WHERE YOU HAVE? SUBCONTRACTORS TO SUBCONTRACTORS TO SUBCONTRACTORS. AND THIS WORKFORCE IS NOT BEING TRAINED. THE LEVEL THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS OF SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. THE SHOCKING. WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE MOST UPDATED NUMBERS FROM CAL OSHA. BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU FOR THE NUMBERS AVAILABLE FROM OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE TO SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SO. FOR LESS THAN TWO YEARS. THERE WERE SEVENTY FOUR SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. FIFTY FOUR RESULTING IN HOSPITALIZATION. AND ELEVEN DEATHS. WE THINK THE NUMBER LEVEL OF ACCIDENTS IN JUST THE LAST YEAR. ARE FAR GREATER THAN THOSE NUMBERS. AND THESE ACCIDENTS GO UNREPORTED. BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS WORKFORCE. EITHER UNDOCUMENTED OR HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED. WHEN THEY'RE INJURED? THEY WALK AWAY THEY DON'T REPORT IT. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE CONTRACTORS. NOT THE PRIME SUBCONTRACTORS BUT TYPICALLY THE SUBCONTRACTORS AND THIRD TIER SUBCONTRACTORS. THEY'LL HIRE SOMEBODY OFF THE STREET TO BE A VEGETATION MANAGEMENT TECHNICIAN. WHOSE JOB IS TO CUT BRUSH. TO CLEAR BRUSH. BUT WHEN THEY GET HIM BACK INTO THE WOODS. THE HAND OF A CHAIN SAW UNTIL MISTER CUTTING TREES. WE HAD A POOR FELLOW JUST ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF AGO. TO PASS AWAY BECAUSE HE PULLED A TREE ON HIMSELF BECAUSE HE NOT BEEN TRAINED ON HOW TO PROPERLY FALL A TREE. THIS IS A CRISIS THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE PROPOSE IN THIS LEGISLATION. TO REQUIRE THE UTILITIES. TO REQUIRE THAT THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS. TRAIN AND CERTIFY ALL OF THESE WORKERS WITH. AT LEAST MINIMUM SAFETY TRAINING. BEFORE THEY PUT HIM OUT INTO THE FIELD AND THAT THE TILITIES PROVIDE THE FINANCING. FOR THAT TRAINING. MY LAST POINT MISTER CHAIR IS WHY THIS IS A VERY COMBUSTIBLE SITUATION. IS BECAUSE THE UTILITIES PAY THE CONTRACTORS BY THE NUMBER OF TREES. THE WORKERS ARE PAID A VERY LOW VERY LOW HOURLY WAGE THAT IS A DANGEROUS COM -- COMBINATION BECAUSE HE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR THAT THIRD TIER SUBCONTRACTOR HIS DETAILS CREW CUT DOWN AS MANY TREES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT IS EIGHT IS ANTITHETICAL TO SAFETY. SO WE URGE AN AYE VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU SIR. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. HI ORIGINAL COST HERE IN BEHALF OF COALITION FOR CALIFORNIA UNTIL THE EMPLOYEES -- COUNCIL AND HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THANK YOU. OTHERS. THERE'S A MOTION -- ANY IN OPPOSITION. YEAH I CAN'T RECOGNIZE YOUR MOTION CANCER CENTER -- YES SIR GOOD MORNING JOHN KENNEDY WITH THE RURAL COUNTIES WE HADN'T OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED RECOMMENDATION -- IT LOOKS LIKE THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESS MOST OF OUR CONCERNS AND THAT YOU'RE ADOPTING THOSE. SO WE LOOK FOR TO LOOKING AT THE BILL AND REEVALUATING OUR POSITION AS IT MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. MISTER CANNON. YES KAREN MILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION WE SUBMITTED AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- ON THE BILL I WELL WE CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH SENATOR DODD'S OFFIE WHICH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE WITH HIS OFFICE -- WE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL WAS. BROADER THAN IT NEEDED TO BE BASED ON THE CLEAR AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT FARM BUREAU WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE IT SO OPPOSITION AND GO TO A NEUTRAL POSITION AND WILL BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT WHEN THAT BILL IS IN PRETTY GOOD THANK YOU -- THANK YOU APPRECIATE. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OR REMOVING OPPOSITION [inaudible] VERY GOOD. MEMBERS QUESTIONS YES CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ADVANCING THIS. FROM. IN. THE PARTICIPANTS IN SUPPORT. A QUESTION AND THE CAL FIRE. INTO ENGAGEMENT WOULD THAT JUST BE AN S. STARRING AREAS. HER CAL FIRE CURRENTLY PROTECTS FORCED OR WOULD IT GO INTO OTHER AREAS WHERE. P. JEANNIE OR THE UTILITIES MIGHT HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY. FOR CALIFORNIA'S POST AUDIT ROLL IT WOULD COVER ALL AREAS AS SARIS AND ALLERGIES THANK YOU AND THEN. WHAT IS THE CAPACITY OF CAL FIRE TO TAKE ON? THIS. ADDED OBLIGATION. WHAT [inaudible] CEREMONY. A DIALOGUE WITH CAL FIRE BUT THE WAY THE WAY THE BILL IS STRUCTURED. IS THAT THE RATE PAYER DOLLARS THE TODAY GO TO THE UTILITIES TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES WOULD BE A PASS THROUGH TO PAY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL PIECEWISE THE CALIFORNIA READ NEED. TO ADDRESS THIS NEED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. IN THIS CURRENT SYSTEM OF THE HE COMPARED IT TO THE FARM LABOR CONTRACTOR. WITH THAT. THAT WOULDN'T BE ABOLISHED YOU DESCRIBED THERE WOULD BE A TRAINING REQUIREMENT FOR THOSE SUBCONTRACTORS SO THERE'D STILL BE. THESE RECRUITED SUBCONTRACTORS WORKING AT LOW HOURLY WAGE. THE THE THE THE WAGE SCALE WOULD STILL BE THE UNION SCALE WHICH UNFORTUNATELY. IS NOT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE. IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE HISTORY OF THIS PARTICULAR WORKFORCE BEING ON ORGANIZED. WHAT WE HOPE IS A BY INSTITUTIONALIZING THIS TRAINING PROGRAM WHICH THE UNION WOULD BE INVOLVED WITH? THE WILL PROVIDE US WITH A WAY TO BETTER. REGULATE AND AND AND WHO IS BEING HIRED WHO ARE BECOMING OUR MEMBERS. SO WE CAN EDUCATE THEM IN THAT PROCESS AND ALSO MONITOR THEM. AND THIS MAY BE A LITTLE TANGENTIAL THAT YOU REFERRED TO THE INJURIES AND THE DEATHS. PRESUMABLY THEY'RE EMPLOYED BY SOMEBODY IN SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION. ARE SOME OF THESE SUBCONTRACTORS SO ROGUES THAT THEY'RE NOT CARRYING WORKERS COMP. YEAH THAT IS A CONCERN IN FACT AT THE LAST CONTRACTOR STATE LICENSING BOARD MEETING IN SAN DIEGO ABOUT A MONTH AGO. WITHOUT. US EVEN BRING IN THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION. THEY IT CHEN DIES. A ITEM WHERE THE LICENSING BOARD IS GOING TO START IT IS INSTITUTING A PROCESS TO IT. TOO DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE REQUIREMENTS ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CONTRACTORS LICENSEES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF NOT JUST INJURIES BUT ALSO THE LACK OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. IT MEANS THAT SIR CRIME IN THIS STATE I THOUGHT IT IS% Q.. COM THANK FEDERAL FOR CLOSE TO A QUORUM. MANY ONE MORE OKAY THANK YOU IN THEM ON ME WELL I THINK YOU ALREADY TRIED TO MOVE IT WILL ONE OF A SOME OF THEM WHEN WE GET A QUORUM. YEAH. GET INTO YOUR MIND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THE THE AMENDMENTS TO WILL INTEGRATE THAT THAT TRIM LIST INTO THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. THAT THEN WE'LL GO. BEYOND THOSE S. R. AREAS BUT THROUGH THOSE UTILITY PLANS AS IT IS SO THERE'S THERE'S GONNA BE INTEGRATION IT'S NOT THAT CAL FIRES GOING TO SORT OF BE ACTING ON ITS OWN. DIPPING INTO ALL THESE DIFFERENT TERRITORIES THAT THE THE AMENDS WE'RE GONNA BE PASS AND A AND A GREAT THAT YEAH COURSE -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS -- WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL FOR WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A QUORUM OUR MISTER I'VE JUST TO CLOSE I DESPERATELY WANT TO THANK YOU AND AND YOUR STAFF -- FOR YEAH WORKING -- ON THIS BILL AND OBVIOUSLY TAKING THE OPPOSITION -- AWAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE BEEN HELD. THANK YOU SIR -- DO YOU WANT TO PRESENT TO US I I THINK IT'S FILE AND FOR TWO FIFTY THREE YES SIR. OKAY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTER AN INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAM. LET ME BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE PROGRAM TO OPTIMIZE WILDLIFE HABITAT BENEFITS WHILE SUPPORTING THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AGRICULTURE IS A MAJOR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO VALUABLE OPEN SPACE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT. THE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND CONSERVATION PRACTICES OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS ALSO ENHANCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY PROVIDE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND OFFER OTHER SOCIAL BENEFITS. IN RECENT YEARS THE DELIVERY OF ON FARM CONSERVATION PRACTICES AS THE CLIENT. THIS DCLINE IS DRIVEN BY THE RISING COSTS OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION INCLUDING WATER AND ENERGY COSTS. MORE RESOURCES AND TOOLS ARE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA'S FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE A PROVIDE MULTIPLE CONSERVATION BENEFITS TO ON FARM PRACTICES. THE PURPOSE OF INCENTIVE BASED CONSERVATION PROGRAMS ARE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE WILDLIFE FRIENDLY IMPROVEMENTS ON THEIR LAND. THE PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS TO CREATE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT IT PROVIDED DID ADDED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER QUALITY EROSION CONTROL. AND CONSERVE GROUNDWATER. OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BY THE LEGISLATURE. SB TWO FIFTY THREE IS SUPPORTED BY THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WHICH IS HERE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ FORCED BURKE AND I'M THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR POLICY FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL. TWO FIFTY THREE A CALIFORNIA'S APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED MILLION ACRES FORTY THREE MILLION ACRES ARE USED FOR AGRICULTURE AND HE'S WORKING FARMS AND RANCHES PRODUCE MUCH OF THE COUNTRY'S FOOD AND FIBER. THESE WORKING LANCE ALSO PROVIDE MUCH OF OUR STATES OPEN SPACE AND HABITAT THAT WILDLIFE NEEDS. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AGRICULTURE PRODUCERS WHO WANT TO VOLUNTARILY MAKE CONSERVATION PREVENTS TO THEIR LAND. WITH THE HELP FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL FARMING INCENTIVE PROGRAM CREATED AN SP TWO FIFTY THREE PRODUCERS WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ON FARM PRACTICES THAT LIVER ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED WATER AND AIR QUALITY CONSERVE GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER. OR CREATED WILDLIFE HABITAT. SOME OF THESE HABITAT PROJECTS COULD INCLUDE WILDLIFE FAMILY FARMING THAT ALLOWS FOR SAFE WILDLIFE MOVEMENT. AND FLOODING RICE FIELDS FOR MIGRATORY BIRD HABITAT. SB TWO FIFTY THREE WOULD SUPPORT SCIENCE DRIVEN INVESTMENTS TO DELIVER BENEFITS THE PUBLIC ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT CAN BE REDUCED REASONABLY EXPECTED THAT LANDOWNERS CONFIDE IN THEIR OWN. CALIFORNIA IS THE COUNTRY'S LEADING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCER AND THE STATE SHOULD DO MORE TO INCENTIVIZE INNOVATIVE CONSERVATION PROGRAMS THAT WILL HAVE TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND HELP IMPROVE OUR FARM AND RANCH LANDS WE ARE AT YOUR SUPPORT. THEY HI MY NAME IS KAREN BERMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS -- THE NINETY SIX OR CITIES IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO MAKE AGRICULTURE PART OF THE CONSERVATION SOLUTION FOR SINCE THE DUST BOWL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON CONSERVATION FROM THE PRACTICES ON FARMS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY -- MOVE THE NEEDLE ON WHAT HAGLUND IS ABLE TO PRODUCE. AND MOST OF US WERE COULDN'T BE DONE THOUGH WITHOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES CONSERVATION SERVICE. AND NOT ONLY DO THEY PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR THE PROVIDE A GOOD DEAL OF FUNDING THAT HELPS TO IMPROVE FARMLAND. AND DO THINGS A LIKE REDUCE NON POINT SOURCE POLLUTION POLLUTION. PROTECT REDUCE SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION AND CONSERVING GROUND WATER AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING HABITAT FOR AT RISK SPECIES. HAVING A STATE ANALOGUES AND RCS IS THIS BILL. WOULD CREATE I WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND TOOLS FOR THE OUR CITIES AND FOR OTHERS TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE PRACTICES ON FARMLAND -- IN PARTICULAR WE BE ABLE TO TO LEVERAGE THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THAT THEN -- CS PUTS IN THREE QUICK PROGRAMS AND AND THROUGH THEIR FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON CALIFORNIA'S PACIFIC PROJECTS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE FEDERAL PRIORITIES ARE. SO GIVE US A CHANCE TO REALLY LEVERAGE FUNDING AND AND REALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- BECAUSE OF THIS SO WE THINK SENATOR DODD FOR LEADING ON THIS ISSUE AND WE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA NOLAN AGENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING.

THING OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK. SING THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DICE COMMENTS QUESTIONS SENATE CAREER. THANKS VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR -- SENATOR [inaudible] EIGHTY AS THE AS SIGMA. STARTS TO BE IMPLEMENTED -- AT LEAST PRELIMINARILY IT LOOKS LIKE THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT. BOMB. COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED IN PARTICULAR IN MY DISTRICT -- WHETHER IT'S A COMMUNITY THAT IS SURROUNDED BY FARMLAND OR THAT IS DEPENDENT BECAUSE IT HOLE ECONOMY IS IS A IS CONNECTED TO FARMING IT IS THERE THE POSSIBILITY OF OF OF OF THE YOUR BILL AND AND HOW YOU STRUCTURED IT TO BE ABLE TO COME IN WITH RESOURCES -- TO DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD TRANSITION FOR THAT COMMUNITY AND I'M I'M THINKING IN PARTICULAR -- IN MUCH OF MY DISTRICT USED THE WETLANDS AND BUT YOU DON'T JUST FELLOW LANDING YOU GET WITH THE HANDS -- AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S IF THERE ARE. IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. IN YOUR BILL TO CREATE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY OR AT LEAST TO START TO IDENTIFY THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE -- GOOD TO PUT TOWARDS SUSTAINABILITY -- SO WE DON'T END UP WITH DUST BOWL AREAS AND WE REALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT ENHANCING THE ECONOMY OF THE REGION RATHER THAN DESTROYING IT AND I AM I AM I IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THAT'S THE CASE BUT I WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU. THAT THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL AND AND YOU KNOW THE GIVING THE R. C. D. THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE. TO COME AND GIVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES. TO FARMERS -- IT GOES A LONG WAY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW SAVING WATER IN MAKING SURE THAT -- THE PRACTICES ARE SUSTAINABLE FOR THE FUTURE THAT'S EXCELLENT I APPRECIATE THAT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- LOVE THE BILL. IT REALLY GETTING AHEAD OF THIS AND TAKE A MORE INTEGRATED APPROACH. WE'VE GOT A FEW OTHER INTERESTING CDFA PROGRAMS WHICH WE KNOW CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS BUT I NOTED. THAT JUST FEEL THE GAS WOULD HAVE AN INTEGRATED APPROACH THERE I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT AND I I SECOND. TO THE CONCERNS FROM CENTER HAVE A YEAR IN TERMS OF SPECIAL IN A WAY HERE LIKE THIS TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF WHAT WILL BE EVENTUALLY A DROUGHT AGAIN. AND LOOKING AT GROUND WATER RECHARGE BENEFITS -- SOMEBODY TO THE CONSERVATION MEMBERS IS A VERY EXCITING COALITION SAT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'LL BE BUT I'D LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GET A SENSE THOUGH JUST WELL WE HAD A QUICK SECOND FROM IS FORSBERG. NATURAL COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY CONSERVATION PLANS HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANS. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU PICTURE THIS INTEGRATING IN SORT OF THE PLANNING PROCESS DO YOU SEE THOSE BEING? RELATED YEAH ABSOLUTELY THIS IS A OUR GOAL TO PROVIDE MORE TOOLS TO OUR LAND AND SO I CAN LAND AND RANCH PRODUCERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HABITAT ON BAG LAND. AND SO BUT BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND MORE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE CAN REALLY INCORPORATING COORDINATE WITH EXISTING PLANNING PROCESS IS OUT THERE. I I WOULD JUST LOVE TO SEE AS WE GO FORWARD A NOD TO SORT OF TRYING. TO MAKE THOSE H. C. P.'S OF THE NCC PEAS REALLY WORK AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF REPAIRING THE INCENTIVES WITH. THE EITHER ESA COMPLIANCE OR CIGNA COMPLIANCE RIGHT TO REALLY MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT. TO MAKE OUR REGULATION SIDE WORKS AT THANKS FOR THAT ALL NOT BELABOR THIS FURTHER ACTUALLY VIEWED HOLD ON WE ACTUALLY OF A QUORUM NOW -- WAIT WE LOSE ONE NO. NOW WE WERE GOOD -- SO PARTNERS FOR SECOND WOULD YOU MIND CALL THE ROLL SENATOR STERN HERE STERN HERE JONES ALAN. BURGESS BURGESS PRESIDENT CABALLERO [inaudible] HERTZBERG HUESO.

WELCOME GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS WILD FIRES HAVE BECOME LARGER AND MORE FREQUENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE EFFORTS TO NOTIFY AND ALERT THE PUBLIC IN A TIMELY MANNER HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. SB ONE THIRTY ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY DIRECTING CAL FIRE TO CREATE A PERMANENT GRANT PROGRAM TO INSTALL AND IMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY FIRE SIREN WARNING SYSTEM. FOR CITIES THAT ARE DEEMED BY CAL FIRE TO BE IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY SOUNDS. THESE INSTALLATIONS COULD INCLUDE A VOICE WARNING SYSTEM SUPPORTED BY LOCATION BASED MESSAGING. THAT ENABLES THE BROADCAST OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING EVACUATION. THE SPEED EVERYTHING CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES IS FORCING US TOWARDS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO NOTIFY PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY. THIS BILL ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF PROTECTION TO IMPROVE CURRENT ALERT SSTEMS BY FINDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIRE WARNING SYSTEM WHERE OTHER TECHNOLOGY MIGHT FAIL. THE COST PER SYSTEM WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF TEN TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SIREN. SIRENS CAN USUALLY BE HEARD FOR ONE MILE IN EACH DIRECTION AND CAN EASILY BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR EXISTING WARNING SYSTEMS WITH ME TODAY IS CHRIS WALLER FROM L. BRAD CORPORATION TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING SPEAKERS AND SIREN IMPLEMENTATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR. GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS CHRIS ROLLER ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF L. READ CORPORATION WE ARE -- SAN DIEGO. PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY -- IN RESPONSE -- TO THAT WE SUPPORT THE BILL -- SB -- ONE THIRTY IN RESPONSE TO THE OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND ATTACK ON THE USS COLE WE DEVELOP A LONG RANGE ACOUSTIC DEVICE. AND ESTABLISH THE ACOUSTIC HAILING DEVICE INDUSTRY SELLING SOLUTIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS -- WE'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS. IN OUR SYSTEMS WITH OUR SOFTWARE HAS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY MASS CERTIFICATION HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED AND OVER SEVENTY TWO COUNTRIES. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- L. READ CORPORATION CREATES A CRYSTAL CLEAR SPEAKER TECHNOLOGY. THAT CAN ALLOW A PERSON TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND A MESSAGE AT EXTREMELY FAR DISTANCES SUCH AS A MILE RADIUS -- IN ADDITION TO THIS THE SPEAKER TECHNOLOGY IS AN IP BASED SOLUTION THAT CAN LAYER APPROACH WITH THE CELL PHONE CALL OUT. AND ALSO -- SEISMIC DETECTION FLOOD ALERT -- WARNINGS -- SO THAT YOU CAN CAN FIND THE WHOLE SOLUTION TOGETHER. SO IF YOU IMAGINE NUMBER TO SEE MANAGER BEING ABLE TO CREATE ON THE FLY FROM HIS HOME. USING A HAND PHONE OR COMPUTER THEY CAN BASICALLY CREATE A POLY GONE ALL THAT IT OF THE SPECIFIC AREA AND PROVIDED NOTIFICATION TO A SPEAKER OR TO A CELL PHONE. AND BE ABLE TO CALL THAT SAYING THAT THERE'S A FIRE IN THE SOUTH THAT YOU WANT TO EVACUATE TO THE NORTH AND YOU CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. CRYSTAL CLEAR MESSAGES THROUGH THIS SOLUTION THROUGHOUT IN A VENT -- L. REDS -- FROM THE LESSONS LEARNED WE FOUND OUT THAT -- L. READ SOLUTION CAN BE A SATELLITE COMMUNICATION A SOLAR POWER -- SOLUTION AND IT'S A CLOUD BASED SOFTWARE SO IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RELY ON THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IF THAT WERE TO FAIL BY BY FIRES. THE READ ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY. IS AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIANS TODAY AND WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH FEMALE WHO FULLY SUPPORT OUR SOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE -- FOR THE HI TOURISM AREA WHERE THEY'VE INSTALLED OUR SPEAKERS AND THEY HAVE A MULTI LET LEVEL APPROACH WHERE THEY CAN CALL OUT WITH CELL PHONES. AND YOU SPEAKERS TO COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC. EMERGENCY MANAGERS ARE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE SO SOLUTIONS -- MENLO PARK TRYING TO TIE INTO THE SIZE MAKE -- THE BILL VALLEY IN MARIN COUNTY TRYING. TO REPLACE SOME OF THE OUTDATED SPEAKER FIRE SIRENS THAT THEY HAD WITH SOLUTIONS LIKE OURS. SINCE THE MANAGERS WANT THE SOLUTIONS THEY WANT TO HAVE A MULTI LAYERED APPROACH BUT FUNDING IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE. SO SUPPORTING THE SP ONE THIRTY IS A GOOD FIRST STEP TOWARDS SOLVING THIS ISSUE. CREATED THANK THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING NOT YOUR MOM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT VERY GOOD THANK YOU MA'AM. OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE ANY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE MEMBERS BRING IT BACK CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ADVANCING THIS BUT I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS -- HELLO DO CITIES GET PRIORITIZED. FOR BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THIS. TIME WERE ASKING THAT CAL FIRE COME UP WITH THE GRANT PROGRAM AND WHEN WE WOULD DEFER TO HOW THEY MAKE THE DETERMINATION BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO THE CITIES WOULD HAVE TO BE WITHIN. VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES PRESUMABLY THERE ARE A LOT OF CITIES IN OUR STATE. THE MEET THAT THRESHOLD OF BEING IN A HI FIRESTONE -- ONE OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS IS REVERSE. NINE ONE ONE THERE'S BEEN SOME CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTING THAT -- IMPLEMENTING THAT WITH PEOPLE WITH CELL PHONES I COULD SEE HOW THIS MIGHT PLUG THAT GAP. BUT TEN MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY BUT YOU SPREAD IT AMONG [inaudible] HUNDRED CITIES. MORE. FIVE HUNDRED CITIES POTENTIALLY AT RISK YES I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE BUT I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE THE THINKING IN THE MATH OF HOW THIS. WOULD GET DEPLOYED YES -- SENATOR THIS THIS WAS AN IDEA THAT I HAD THAT I HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD AND I AM NOT -- ADAMANT ABOUT EXACTLY HOW THAT SHOULD WORK IN EXACTLY -- HOW MUCH SHOULD BE GIVEN TO EACH CITY I'M HOPING RATHER THAT THEY THE COMMITTEE PROCESS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL HELP US? HONE IN ON SOME OF THOSE DETAILS AND CERTAINLY CAL FIRE HAS THE EXPERTISE AND THEY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND AND WHERE WITH ALL TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHICH WHICH CITIES. THIS COULD WORK BASS STAND AND WHICH CITIES ARE LACKING AND AND SOME OF THE DIFFERENT TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY. SO AGAIN I'M HELPING. TO FLESH THIS OUT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS ANY ANY SUGGESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE CERTAINLY I WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S AUTHOR SPONSOR AGAIN THANK YOU. NINE I WOULD THINK THAT. CAL FIRE IN. MUNICIPAL FIRE -- DISTRICT FIRE UNITS AS WELL MAY HAVE AN INTEREST SO. YOUR WITNESS SOME. IS APPARENTLY WOULD BE ONE OF THE VENDORS ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMPANIES OR IS THIS A SINGLE VENDOR BILL THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES -- THAT PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. THERE ARE SOME WHERE THEY'RE STRICTLY SIRENS THERE OTHERS WHERE THE VOICE MESSAGING CAN BE INCORPORATED -- WE PUT THE BILL OUT THERE AND AND ONCE IT WAS PUT INTO PRINT -- MISS THE ROD CORPORATION CAME FORWARD AND OFFERED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BETTER THEIR COMPANY IS ONE OF SEVERAL COMPANIES. THAT PROVIDE. FOR THE SIREN TECHNOLOGY SIN JUST AS IT MOVES FORWARD I WOULD EXPECT THAT IT. IT WOULD BE. OPEN TO SOME FORM OF OPEN BIDDING. ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND ONCE AGAIN WE'RE DEFERRING TO CAL FIRE TO COME UP WITH THE CAMP GRANT PROGRAMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THERE WERE JUST. THANK YOU I THINK -- MEMBER DODD -- TO MEET MONNING -- HAD TO HONE IN ON MY QUESTION TO TO YOU THAT THIS IS GOING TO GO THROUGH A NATURAL PROCESS -- FOR IN OPEN BIDDING -- SITUATION. AND AGAIN NOT NARROWLY TAILORED TO USE SPECIFICALLY SATISFIED. ONE COMPANY. ABSOLUTELY NOT ABSOLUTELY NOT. IT WAS VERY GENERIC ONLY STARTED WITH THIS -- WITH SIMPLY FIRE SIRENS AND WHAT I'VE LEARNED AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES THAT. CAN BE INCORPORATED WITH THE FIRE SIRENS BUT AGAIN. MY BILL PROPOSES TO LEAVE THE DETAILS TO TO CAL FIRE AND LESS THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- WE DETERMINE THAT WE SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFIC WELL I I THOROUGHLY SUPPORT YOUR AMENDMENT TO LIMIT THIS TO STANISLAUS MADERA AND FRESNO COUNTIES [inaudible] THANK YOU. GET OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANKS FOR BEING BRING IN IS FOR I'M A LITTLE BIASED BECAUSE I'M A CO AUTHOR AND SOCIETY -- DON'T OFTEN DO THAT WITH BILLS COMING FOR HIS COMMITTEE BUT WE JUST WENT THROUGH. HELL -- DOWN AND WE'LL SEE AND LOT OF PEOPLE MISS THE SIGNAL -- SO ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE CELL PHONE GAPS OR CELL PHONE EQUIPMENT GOES DOWN WAS APPRECIATED TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY THIS AND WITH THE AMENDMENT JUST. FY I MEMBERS THIS ALSO IS IT AGAIN NOT LIMóN STRICTLY THE SIRENS IT'S ALSO OTHER VOICE WARNING SYSTEMS LOCATION BASED MESSAGING ETCETERA SO -- I WOULD ENTERTAIN A CLOSE AND EMOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME -- THANK YOU FOR ENTERTAINING. QUESTIONS AND I AGAIN WOULD BE OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS EVEN LATER ON IN THE PROCESS IS WE ALL. BECOME MORE LEARNED ABOUT THIS TOPIC SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. LOS FOR CENTER BOARD IS IS DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE NEWS STERN STERN AYE JONES ALLEN. ALLEN AYE BARGES BARGES AYE CABALLERO CAREER -- I HERTZBERG HUESO. SO AYE JACKSON MONEY. I MEAN I THAT HAS SUFFICIENT VOTES. SO WE WILL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL. THANK YOU SENATOR. ALL RIGHT. COMING UP. ON DECK SENATOR MOORE Là FROM DOWN [inaudible] UNDER. WELCOME GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR HOW ARE YOU. IT IS A WELL SIR IT IS GOING TO BE A FUN DAY IT SURE IS. FOR MOVING RIGHT ALONG. MISTER CHAIR IN HER TO PRESENT SENATE BILL -- FIVE EIGHTY FOUR FIRST OF ALL WHEN I THINK -- YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR ALL THE HARD WORK YOU'RE DOING ON TRYING TO REDUCE. FUTURE WILD FIRES -- NOPE YOU HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND WE'VE GOT CERTAINLY THE LA TIMES CAME OUT WITH A PRETTY INTERESTING -- FIRE MAPPER -- THIS IS THE REGISTERS DAILY TIMES CAME OUT TO GET INTO THIS JUST CAME OUT THE OTHER DAY BUT SOME OF THESE AREAS AND OUR OUR ERROR ARE PART OF THE STATE THAT ARE. SUBJECT TO WILDFIRE -- IN SO - WE HAVE THEM COULD BEING CAUSED BY SPARKING ELECTRIC LINES. SO COLLEAGUES WITH THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ALREADY HAVING SPECIAL FUNDS FOR ADDRESSING OVERHEAD POWER LINES FOR PURPOSES OF BUTTE BEAUTIFICATION. KNOWN AS RULE TWENTY A OR B. AND C.. THE GOAL OF SB FIVE EIGHTY FORCED TO BETTER UTILIZE THESE FUNDS FOR THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK TIER. THREE TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS ON PEOPLE AND PROPERTY FROM UTILITY ASSOCIATED WILDFIRES. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE FOR MATCHING FUND OPPORTUNITIES ALLOWING THE I. O. USED TO PARTNER WITH WILLING COMMUNITIES FOR CONVERSION PROGRAM TO UNDERGROUND CERTAIN ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FUNDING WOULD ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THE G. G. R. F.. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR PROVIDES A PROFESSIONAL FRAMEWORK. OF COOPERATION BETWEEN A CLIENT TO COMMUNITY AND AN ELECTRIC UTILITY PROVIDER IT PROVIDES ACCESS TO EXISTING TOOLS AND REVENUES FOR A WIN WIN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE UTILITIES WHO LEARNED HARD LESSONS TWO DECADES AGO THEY HAVE BEEN HARDENING ASSETS METHODICALLY OVER THE PAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS AND SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR CONTINUES THIS EFFORT WITH A METHOD TO EXPEDITE SMART TRANSMISSION OF POWER. IN THE SAFEST COLLABORATIVE MANNER AND I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANKS A LOT. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S COREY WILLIAMS ON BEHALF OF THE BILL SPONSORED THE CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH. THE CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH IS A SMALL COMMUNITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND RESIDENTS WE ARE SURROUNDED BY OCEANS HELL'S CANYON SENT OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF WILD SPACE. ARE ALMOST NINE SQUARE MILES pTOURISTS A YEAR. IN ADDITION THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN A CHASING COMMUNITIES THAT BORDER OUR OPEN SPACE APPROXIMATELY 85% OF THE CITY IS LOCATED IN A VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONE. WITH APPROXIMATELY 55% WITHIN THE TIER THREE SOUND. THE RESIDENTS AND TOURISTS ACCESS THE CITY THROUGH TO STATE HIGHWAYS PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY IN STATE ROUTE. ONE THIRTY THREE BETTER KNOWN AS LAGUNA CANYON ROAD. THESE ARE THE ONLY TWO WAYS IN OR OUT OF THE CITY. GONNA CANYON ROAD IS A TWO LANE AT WIND THE ROAD THROUGH TRY WILDERNESS BORDERED BY ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE UTILITY POLES. THESE POLLS ARE CLEAR PUBLIC SAFETY RISK FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE HAVE BEEN OVER SIXTY VEHICLE VERSUS POLL ACCIDENTS ON LAGUNA CANYON ROAD. SHUTTING DOWN THE ROAD DOZENS OF TIMES IN SOME CASES FOR DAYS DUE TO FALLING POWER LINES WHICH BLOCK OFF ACCESS POINTS IN AND OUT OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE LAST TWELVE YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST FOUR FIRES IN THE OPEN SPACE IN THE CITY THAT HAVE BEEN SPARKED BY JOHN UTILITY LINES AND POLES. AS MANY HAVE DONE THE CITY OF LAGUNA BEACH VISITED PARADISE IN JANUARY TO SEE WHAT LESSONS WE CAN LEARN FROM THE DISASTER THERE AND APPLY THEM TO OUR COMMUNITY. WE LEARNED ABOUT LIKE LAGUNA PARADISE SUFFERED FROM LIMITED INGRESS AND EGRESS ROUTES AND DURING THE CRUCIAL EARLY HOURS OF THE FIRE A DOCU ATION ROUTES WERE BLOCKED BY DOWNED. POLES IN LINES. AS ONE OF THE CAL FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDERS TOLD THE CITY. THE DOWNED POWER POLES WERE HUGE PROBLEM DURING THE EVACUATION PROCESS. SB FIVE EIGHTY FOUR WILL CREATE A MEANS OF CREATING SAFE EVACUATION ROUTES AND HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRE SEASON WAS THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASON ON RECORD IN CALIFORNIA WITH A TOTAL OF EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN FIRES WHICH BURN THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF ACREAGE RECORDED IN A FIRE SEASON. QUALIFIER HAS DETERMINED THAT AT LEAST NINETEEN WILD FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE CAUSED BY UTILITY LINES AND EQUIPMENTS. THE EASY PUSH BACK ON UNDER GROUNDING IS THAT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. BUT THIS IS A SHORT SIGHTED ANALYSIS THAT FOCUSES ONLY ON THE UP FRONT COST WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE HUMAN LOSS THE PROPERTY DAMAGE THE HEALTH HAZARDS IN COSTS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE TO WATER RESOURCES FOREST'S IN OPEN SPACE THE MOUNTAINS OF HAZARDOUS WASTE CREATED AND THAT GREENHOUSE GASES EMITTED FROM ONE MAJOR WILDFIRE. OFFSETS AN ENTIRE YEAR OF SAVINGS FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THE TRUE COSTS OF UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. LOCATING THE HAZARDOUS UTILITY POLES BELOW GROUND AND TIER THREE FIRE ZONES WE ARE INVESTING IN SMART INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LOOKS TO THE FUTURE. THE FINANCIAL TOLL FOR HOMEOWNERS RENTERS BUSINESSES AND THE STATE IN THE PAST TO FIRE SEASONS HAS TOP TEN BILLION DOLLARS AND INSURED LOSSES EACH YEAR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WITH REDUCE TAX REVENUES IN ADDED EXPENSES IN THE STATE HAS HAD TO SHOULDER THE FIRE FIGHTING COSTS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO SEE THESE FIRES UNDERMINE KEY ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. IT'S TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT WILL HOLD UTILIIES ACCOUNTABLE TO EXPEDITE UNDERGROUND IN PROJECTS. ASK IMPACTED JURISDICTIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF THESE PROJECTS AND PROVIDE A FAIR FUNDING MECHANISM THROUGH THE STATE TO SUPPORT THESE PROJECTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

A SIMPLE AS DOING THE SAME AND THE SAN DIEGO AREA JUST METHODICALLY WORKING AND AND SO HERE WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY I THINK.

WELCOME. GOOD MORNING IT IS A PLEASURE ESPECIALLY FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE I'M A SAY -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT -- THIS BILL TODAY -- SP FOUR ZERO TWO HE IS A FIVE YEAR EXTENSION TO IN YOUR COUNTIES ADVENTURE TRAIL PILOT PROGRAM. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AB SIX TO EIGHT ESTABLISH THIS PILOT PROGRAM. WHICH ALLOWED INYO COUNTY TO DESIGNATE SPECIFIC COUNTY ROADS AS COMBINED USE ROUTES FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE USE. UNFORTUNATELY. DUE TO PROGRAM DELAYS BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT COURT -- ACTION THERE'S NOT BEEN ENOUGH TIME FOR A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM OF THE GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO INCREASE TRAFFIC SAFETY. OF NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION. REDUCE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE TRESPASS ON PRIVATE LAND. AND MINIMIZE IMPACTS ON COUNTY RESIDENTS. NEITHER THIS BILL NOR THE EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM CREATE A SINGLE NEW TRAIL OR ROAD. IT DOES HOWEVER CREATE A BETTER NETWORK OF TRAILS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY A LEGAL MEANS. A LEGAL AND REGULATED MEANS TO ACCESS EXISTING MAINTAIN TRAILS. THIS PROGRAM PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING TRAILS AND LANDS FROM TRUCKS AND TRAILERS. UNLOADING IN STAGING ATV VEHICLES BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TRAILS FROM EXISTING PARKING LOTS CLOSER TO TOWN. ADDITIONALLY BY HAVING THE LINKS TRAIL SYSTEM LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS TO PROPERLY DIRECT -- HV USERS TO APPROVED ROUTES AND REDUCE THE NEED TO PULL POLICE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THIS PROGRAM IS IMPORTANT TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY INYO COUNTY WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF HIGH DESERT WITH LESS THAN 2% PRIVATELY OWNED LAND. HAS A ROBUST ATV -- H. B. COMMUNITY AND RELIES EXTENSIVELY% ON TOURISM DOLLARS. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN INYO RECENTLY VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS EXTENSION. THIS -- THIS BILL WAS PUT FORWARD IN TRANSPORTATION WHERE IT WAS -- SUCCESSFULLY PASSED IN I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR BY VOTE ON S. B.. FOUR ZERO TWO MEMBERS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE -- INYO COUNTY SUPERVISOR MATT KINGSLEY WHO'S HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING WELCOME. THANK YOU SENATOR VOYAGES -- I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FOUR TWO WHICH IS AN EXTENSION OF THE PILOT PROJECT -- CALLED -- ADVENTURE TRAILS A COUPLE POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE -- THE EIGHTY THE ADVENTURE PROGRAM HAS BROAD PUBLIC SUPPORT THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN IN FACT PUBLIC INPUT HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF THE OF THIS PROGRAM SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE'VE HAD TEN FORMAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO GIVE TESTIMONY AND INTERACT WITH OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS WELL AS OUR PLANNING COMMISSION. BUT HAD NO COMPLAINTS THERE'S NO TRAIL CORPORATION NO ACCIDENTS NO LAW ENFORCEMENT INCIDENTS NONE OF THE PREDICTED OUTCOMES -- DESCRIBED BY OPPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM HAS TAKEN PLACE REPORTS OF VIOLATIONS AVOID BY ONLY TWO USERS LIKE MANY COMMUNITIES. PRIMARILY OUR OWN USE -- DRIVING ON THE STREET CUTTING THROUGH SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY KNOW BETTER OR NOT OBEYING LAWS BUT UNRELATED TO THE ADVENTURE TALES PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS -- TO USERS USE EXISTING MAINTAINED. ROADS TO ACCESS CAMPGROUNDS POETRY TRAILS OR SERVICES TO PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES BY EDUCATING. AND ENCOURAGING -- IT'S V. USERS TO RESPECT OUR DISTINCTIVE LANDSCAPE. BY UTILIZING EXISTING ROADS TRAIL PERFORATION AND ROSEN IS IS REDUCED. AND WE ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL WHICH WE USE IS -- TO PARTICIPATE IN SEARCH OF PROJECTS. PLANNING AN EMPTY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EIGHTY PROGRAM HAD BEEN SOLELY FUNDED. BY GREEN STICKER MONEY -- NO CURRENT NO GENERAL FUND MONEY HAS BEEN USED. IN FACT THE COUNTY IS ABLE TO ACTUALLY -- SAVE MONEY BY USING THIS PROGRAM. THE SMALL SCALE OF THE PROJECTS SEVEN ROUTES HAS LIMITED THE ECONOMIC -- BENEFIT BUT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE AN INCREASE IN USE -- PARTICULARLY IN ONE CAMP GROUND IT'S NEW -- BISHOP CALIFORNIA. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO SAY -- A PRIORITY FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO INFORM ENGAGE THE PUBLIC IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS EFFORT USE ENJOYMENT OF THE DENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM. MORE TIME IS NEEDED -- TO BOTH EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND EVALUATE THE PROGRAM. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AS BEFORE -- TO TO CONTINUE THE ADVENTURE TRAILS PILOT PROGRAM THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THANKS TO RESIDENT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ON THE ADMINISTRATION THE PROGRAM THE HIS THANK YOU.

HI AMY GRANT IN A BEHALF TO THE OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE COALITION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THE BALANCE IF THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU OTHERS. THOSE IN OPPOSITION. I'M GOING SECONDS SO. SO WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL DO -- TO TWO MINUTES EACH -- AND THEN OTHERS WHO WANT TO JUST ADD THEIR THEIR NAME IN SUPPORT THAT'LL BE FINE. OPPOSITION I'M SORRY IN OPPOSITION YES GOD GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JONATHAN I'M A THIRTY FIVE YEAR RESIDENT OF BISHOP CALIFORNIA RECENTLY RETIRED FROM IT. TWENTY FIVE YEAR CAREER WITH THE FOR SERVICE HAVE BEEN WORKING FIRE MANAGEMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFERED VEHICLE MANAGEMENT AND VISITOR SERVICES. MY WIFE AND I LIVE IN BISHOP CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT AFFORDS US CLEAN AIR LITTLE CRIME AND A DRAMATIC SCENERY -- IT'S TRULY A PARADISE IS REAR FREQUENTLY REMINDED OF I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON EXTENDING THE TRIAL PERIOD FOR THE ADVENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM. BUT WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE ENCOURAGE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT EMPHASIZES INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FUEL USE POLLUTION AND DEBT THE LAND DEGRADATION. ALL THE SAME TIME PURSUING A POLICY. THE REDUCES OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. THE VENTURE CHILLS PROGRAM IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS TURNING INYO COUNTY INTO A DESTINATION MECCA -- FOR EACH VISA SPECIALLY MOTORCYCLES IN THEORY THE ADVENTURE TROLLS PROGRAM DOES HAVE MERITS BUT IN REALITY NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. ALL THE ADVENTURE PROGRAM -- THE ADVENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM TELLS WRITING INTO TOWNS FOR AMENITIES WHAT IT DOES IN REALITY IS TO MAKE IT CONVENIENT FOR WRITERS TO GO WHEREVER THEY WANT. CAUGHT TRESPASS IF YOU WANT. THE VENTURE TRAILS PROGRAM IS A TROJAN HORSE AND REPRESENTS THE FIRST STEP IN A SLIPPERY SLOPE. IF SB FOUR TWO WAS PASSED IN A PERMANENT ROAD IS ESTABLISHED ON COUNTY AND STATE ROADS. AS STATED BY A PROPONENTS WOULD BE JUST THE FIRST STEP TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL ROUTES WITH THE STATED GOAL OF MAKING INYO COUNTY A DESIGNATED -- EACH BE PLAYGROUND. URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BEFORE -- TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS BEFORE -- TO MY NAME IS MARGARET MARSHALL AND I'M A RETIRED CAL FIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DEALING WITH A FIRE PREVENTION ISSUES THAT REALLY. MAKES ME FEEL WONDERFUL. IN YOUR COUNTY IS A SPECIAL PRAYER PLACE AND ARE RECREATION ECONOMY THRIVES. BECAUSE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN AND DESERT PANORAMA AS CLEAN AIR AND YOU NEED. HIKING BACKPACKING FISHING IN ROCK CLIMBING AND PHOTOGRAPHY BRING TOURISTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. NOT ONE OF THOSE FORMS OF RECREATION HAS REQUIRED A CHANGE THE CALIFORNIA LAW. SB FOUR OH TWO CHANGES THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE. AND IT MAKES IT EASIER FOR OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLES TO TRAVEL BETWEEN SELECTED BUSINESSES. AND THE PUBLIC LANDS. I'M JUST HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT OVERWHELMINGLY POPULAR IN THE COUNTY. WE A LOT OF US ARE WONDERING WHY YOU WOULD SUPPORT. A CODE CHANGE THAT FAVORS ONE FORM OF RECREATION OVER THE OTHERS. WERE WONDERING WHY WE WOULD VOTE FOR A CODE CHANGE. THAT ENCOURAGES A FORM OF RECREATION THAT POLLUTES THE AIR WITH NOISE AND DICED IN GREENHOUSE GASES. AND WE'RE WONDERING WHY YOU WOULD VOTE FOR A CODE CHANGE. THAT MAKES IT EASIER -- FOR HGTV'S TO ACCESS TO PUBLIC LANDS WHEN THOSE VEHICLES HAVE ALREADY DONE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO SITES IN DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK. AND TO THE TRAILS AROUND MY HOME. CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE PROTECTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN INYO COUNTY MAY BE VERY RURAL AND VERY RED. BUT IT'S STILL PART OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU CAST YOUR VOTE -- SO PLEASE VOTE NO ONE'S FOR A TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. DONALD REPRESENTING INYO THREE FIFTY OPPOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. BRIAN A WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WE ARE OPPOSED TO ME ONE SENTENCE OR ONE THAT IS -- THAT THE COUNTY OF INYO HAS PROVIDED A REPORT AND ON THE ON THE PILOT PROJECTS OF FIRE IN THAT REPORT DID NOT INCLUDE. ANY JUSTIFICATION -- BASIS FOR EXTENDING OUR EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM WITH ONLY SEVEN OF THOSE TRAILS OPENS UP MYSELF THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. BRENNAN DAWSON OF THE OFFICE HERE CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS. COMMENTS BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS MISTER VICE CHAIR. MR BORDERS WOULD YOU COULD YOU -- I'LL JUST LEAVE THAT TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE THANK YOU COMMENTS. OF THE WITNESSES AND YOU KNOW JUST TO KIND OF PREFACE THIS -- I CARED A SIMILAR BILL. WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY -- ALLOWING ATVS ACCESS -- TO PUBLIC ROADS SIMILAR TO THE ENTIRE STATE OF ARIZONA -- YOU KNOW THE THE THAT'S A STABLE IT'S A STATEWIDE LAW FOR THEM AND I THINK SEVERAL OTHER -- STATES COLORADO UTAH. THAT SOME OF THEIR MOUNTAIN TOWNS. RELY ON THIS TYPE OF TOURISM FOR THEIR ECONOMY -- BUT I WANT TO A GIVEN OPTION A TO RESPOND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS WE HAVE AN ON FOR FILLED. PILOT PROGRAM. IN THE REASON IT'S BEEN ON FOR FILLED IS BECAUSE THERE WAS LITIGATION AND COURT RELATED ACTION. THAT CHALLENGE THIS. DIRECTLY. AND SO WHEN WE HEAR FROM -- FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ON THIS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE PART OF THE EFFORTS TO NOT HAVE IT PASSED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'M A I'M STRONGLY OF THE OPINION THAT IF WE CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM. IT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO FRUITION WHAT'S THE POINT OF STARTING SOMETHING. IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE -- TO IT YIELDS RESULTS IN LEARN FROM THEM. SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A IN A NEED FOR AN EXTENSION BROUGHT ABOUT BY DELAYS BY THE VERY INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM EARLIER. NOW LET'S NOT CONFUSE SOME OF THE ISSUES -- WITH SOME OF THE SENSATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL DISCUSSIONS THAT OCCUR ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE IN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THIRTY NINE OF THE FORTY FOUR ROADS ARE PAVED. THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS IS TO MAKE CERTAIN. THAT INDIVIDUALS DO NOT DEGRADE THE ENVIRONMENT BY GOING OFF ROAD. THAT'S THE POINT OF THESE DUAL USE -- OPPORTUNITIES SO IF IF INDIVIDUALS ARE PROPONENTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT IT WHICH IS BAFFLED THE IMAGINATION AT THE HELLO THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY. IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT -- AND I THINK. THE I'D PROBABLY LEAVE OPEN IN THE COMMENTS FURTHER WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM -- FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BUT THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE BOB BEFORE THE TRANSPORTATION -- I COMMITTEE -- THE SHERIFF FOR MENU COUNTY WHO EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS. LOOKED UPON IT FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT -- IN ADDITION TO FIRE SAFETY -- IN I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT THAT WANT TO DO SOMETHING RESPONSIBLY WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE -- THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO TO TO BRING THIS PILOT PROGRAM TO FRUITION UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU CENTER. IN A SUPERVISOR WOULD YOU MIND COMMENTING ON ON THE THE THE QUESTION ABOUT THE THE THE PLAN THOUGH THE AT YOUR VALUATION REPORT. BECAUSE NOT NOT. SO WE WERE REQUIRED -- TO IN AGREED IN THE LEGISLATION TO DO AN EVALUATION REPORT NEAR THE END OF THE ONE YEAR LEFT ON THE PILOT PROJECT OUR VALUATION REPORT BASICALLY JUST -- LAYS OUT THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD THE ISSUES BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAVELER INFORMATION ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND THEN -- SEPARATE FROM THAT OUR BOARD VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION -- THE THE EVALUATION REPORT. WHICH WE DIDN'T TRY TO GO INTO -- EXTENSION NECESSARILY WE IT WAS REQUIRED THAT WE GIVE THE INFORMATION ON WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID UNDERSTOOD AND I KNOW IN IN THE ANALYSIS THERE'D BEEN. I GUESS IN. THE MOST RECENT REPORT BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE SAID THAT THERE WERE THIRTY EIGHT SEPARATE APPLICATIONS TO THE COUNTY. TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM GIVE US A STATUS UPDATE ON THERE THAT THAT'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE AND REGIONALLY THERE WAS -- THIRTY EIGHT ADVENTURE TRAILS PROPOSED WHEN WE HELD A HEARING AND NEGOTIATED ON ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM WE HONED IT DOWN -- TO SEVEN ADVENTURE TRAILS AND FORTY FOUR MILES OF ROADS THAT'S WHAT WE ENDED UP AGREEING TO AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AND ANALYZING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING. TO EXPAND FOR THE NEXT. FIVE SO THE THE BILL IT AS IT'S WRITTEN DOZEN EGGS EXPAND DOES NOT AN ADVANTAGE PROGRAM IT EXTENDS THE THE PILOT PERIOD BUT BUT WITHIN THAT THE THE THE CONFINES OF THAT -- THAT ADOPTED FRAMEWORK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT OKAY. TWO OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES CENTER ON JUST FOR THE SUPERVISOR WHAT WHAT WAS THE JUST FOR ME UNDERSTAND LOCAL DYNAMICS WAS OF THE VOTE COUNT AND THE ON THE BOARD WAS IT. UNANIMOUS THREE TWO MINUTES AT UNANIMOUS YOU KNOW IT'S OKAY -- AND THEN I SIDE YOU ARE CHOMPING AT THE BIT ON A COUPLE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. YEAH I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK IT'S BEGIN THE MIKE. A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK BUT I KNOW A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS GET SEPARATED INTO KIND OF LOOKING AT A NARAL PART OF IT. AND WHILE DRIVING ON THE PAVED ROADS IS GONNA REDUCE DICED. IT'S GIVING ACT. THE PEOPLE TO BE IN THE DESERT WHERE THEY CAN MAKE LOTS OF DUST. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LARGER PICTURE IF -- FIFTEEN NO PATIENT ACTUALLY OUT THERE SAYING THAT THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING SO FAR. RIGHT IS AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THAT IN ANY OF THE VALUATIONS. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS THE SECOND EXTENSION. FOR THE SAME REASONS. IT WAS EXTENDED AND THAT. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THIS IS THEIR ASKING FOR ANOTHER X. WHEN YOU SAY THE SAME REASONS THAT THEY GAVE THE REASON THEIR REASON IS THAT. AND THEY'RE SAYING IT'S BECAUSE IT'S BEEN TIED UP IN LITIGATION. WITH OVER A TWENTY FIFTEEN STILL IT'S STILL TOOK A COUPLE OF YEARS TO GET THE PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING HAD -- DESIGNATE THE ROADS YOU KNOW -- SIGNAGE AND ALL OF THAT SO -- IF IT'S TRUE THAT THAT WE HAVE HAD IT BUT IT IT HAS TAKEN AWHILE TO GET IT AND WE HAVE ONLY HAD. REALLY THREE YEARS OF THE FULL USE OF IT TO TO EVALUATE. OKAY MAY MAYBE THERE ISN'T A KIND OF FORMAL CONCLUSION TO THIS REPORT BUT YOU. THREE FOUR YEARS WHEN WILL YOU GUYS ALL LIVE OUT THERE I MEAN YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S HAPPENING OR NOT AND I'M. JUST BECAUSE THE REPORT HASN'T DOCUMENTED EVERY INCIDENT. WE HAVE IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT TRAIL DELIBERATION OR PROBLEMS. WE DO MONITOR THAT CLOSELY IN FACT WE DO IT WITH -- AERIAL MY AERIAL UP TIGER FEE AND WE ARE NOT GETTING A PLAYER FRICTION OF TRAILS WE ARE GETTING SOME USE AND THE USE HAS INCREASED. WE WHAT WE TRIED TO DO AND WE IMPLEMENTED THE PROGRAM WAS PUT A COUPLE OF TRAILS IN EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. SOME OF THOSE TRAILS ARE NOT AS USEFUL OR BEING USED AS MUCH AS OTHERS BUT THE ONES NEAR BISHOP ONE LEADS TO A NO IT'S V. AREA ONE LEADS TO LAWS MUSEUM ONE LEASE TO JUST -- IT FROM A CAMPGROUND AND THAT AND THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE JUST TO PARK AT THE CAMPGROUND. IS THAT -- THAT ARE ARE OPEN -- FOR EACH VIEWS ARE STILL OPEN -- FOR EXCUSE IN AREAS THAT AREN'T ARE NOT PEOPLE CAN ALL THIS DOES IS CHANGE PEOPLE. PUTTING THEIR IT'S FREE ON A TRAILER AND GOING AND PARKING SOMEWHERE AND USING THE AREA AS OPPOSED TO IN THE OF VERY LIMITED AREA DRIVING FROM THE CAMPGROUND TO THE SAME PLACE. WHAT WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE FINAL REPORT? FROM COME IN AT NIGHT. WE WOULD IT. WOULD THAT I HAVE COMMITTED THAT I'M NOT GONNA ASK FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION FOR THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD EITHER ASKED TO IMPLEMENT IT AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS BECAUSE WILL NEED. TO BE WORKING ON IT A YEAR EARLY FOR WILL ABANDON THAT'S AND I MEAN. I HAVE AN ELECTION COMING UPSO. I'LL HAVE TO SEE IF I'M. STILL SUPERVISOR BUT I I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTY WILL NOT SUPPORT TRYING TO GO FOR ANOTHER EXTENSION I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT THE IDEA WOULD BE TO SEE -- WHERE WE'RE AT THE END OF THE NEXT IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS? GIVE THE KID. I DON'T KNOW I I I IT'S IT'S LIKE WE'RE IS A BIT OF YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES HERE OF FOLKS ON THE GROUND SO IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH TO HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING I GUESS ONE THING AS THE COMMITTEE ASKING. FOR A DETAILED ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS -- ON IMPACTS IS AS PART OF THIS BILL WHAT. YEAH SO YOU CAN REPORT THAT WE REQUIRE -- AT THE V&lt;c.cyan&gt;IN THE&lt;/c&gt; VERY LAST SECTION AND CHEAT. G.. ONE I BELIEVE THAT REPORT ALSO INCLUDES AN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS BUT THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A WAYS OFF I WOULD JUST ASK. WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR HERE WE ARE GOING TO SEE THIS BILL FOR TODAY THE STATE -- THIS KEEP THE COMMITTEE APPRISED -- EVEN GOING FORWARD IF WE COULD. BE LOOKING AT SERVE ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS JUST TO MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T SOME ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HAVE AN ANTICIPATED OR SOME PROLIFERATION OF OF OF TRAILS THAT ARE THAT ARE HAVING NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT -- MICE I MEAN JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS ABOUT THIS IS A BILL ABOUT THE USE OF THE ROADS. NOT THE ACTUAL -- HV ACCESS TO BEGIN WITH BUT BUT I THINK THAT -- THAT SENT THERE'S A LOT OF SENSITIVE LAND AT THEIR LOOK AT WHAT IS THE I FORGET IT'S ONE POINT LIKE NINETY NINE ALMOST TO YOU KNOW SLEEP PUBLIC LANDS MOST MOSTLY PUBLIC IN FACT I THINK THE VALUE -- AND APPROPRIATELY SEIZED ON I THINK MAYBE A WAY FORWARD WE'VE HEARD FROM THE SUPERVISOR THAT THERE WILL NOT BE -- IN EXTENSION BEYOND THIS PURSUIT AND I WOULD SUPPORT THAT WE WE GOT TO SEE WHERE THE THE DATA TAKES US. IN IF IT MEETS WITH YOUR APPROVAL -- I'M WONDERING IF WE MIGHT HAVE AN INTERIM -- ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN SUPPORT OF A WE WILL. BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AT THE SAY THE TWO YEAR TO TWO OR THREE YEAR MARK -- DO AN INTERMEDIATE WORK AND SUBMIT THAT THAT WOULD ALSO HELP US -- YOU KNOW FORCE US TO LOOK AT THE PROGRAM -- PART WAY THROUGH YEAH. IN AN BOB. I I I LIKE THE IDEA OKAY BUT ALL I UNDERSTAND THAT AMEND THE NOISE IMPACTS IN ANDERSON SOME OF THE OTHER SORT OF COMMUNITY LEVEL CONCERNS -- BUT AT LEAST ON THIS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE I I WOULD BE GREAT IF THE ENVIRONMENTAL. REVIEW LOOK AT THE AREAS. OUTSIDE OF THE COMBINED USE ROADS THAT ARE IMPACTED. RIGHT I MEAN IT I'VE I HAVE PICTURES OF DAMAGE TO THE MORE AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TO THE READER. BE A LAND IS REQUESTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS YEAR FOR RESTORATION WORK. AND I WILL COME FROM -- H. FEES THAT RE OUT THERE DAMAGING THINGS THAT I'M VERY I I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE HER SENSITIVITIES EXPRESSED -- I THINK EVERYONE THAT LIVES IN THIS AREA THAT'S A GORGEOUS HERE AND IF YOU'RE A BEEN THERE. IT'S AS THE FANTASTIC INYO MONO COUNTY THERE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AREAS. AND I THINK PART OF THE THE THE PASSION THAT UNDERLIE IT -- THIS PILOT PROGRAM IS MAKING CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE DON'T DEGRADE THE ENVIRONMENT BY NOT HAVING ACCESS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU. YOU CUT OFF THE DUAL USE. THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE ARE GOING TO GO ELSEWHERE. IN THE WE'RE TRYING TO STEER THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION JUST TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. SELECT WITH THIS CONVERSATIONS HEADED. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE ALL YOUR OPPOSITION BECAUSE A YOU KNOW ALL THESE. LOCAL ISSUES TO GET CONTENTIOUS BUT I I'M I'M GAME TO WORK WITH YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND EVEN ENGAGE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS TO SCOPE SOME KIND OF INTERIM REPORTS THAT WE CAN -- DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE ANXIETIES OUT THERE WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY -- IMPEDING THE EXTENSION A PILOT. AND I WOULD JUST ASK THAT -- THE COUNTY OR MYSELF GET IS INCLUDED IN THOSE DEAR GRADUATES YOU CAN ARRIVE AT I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT YOUR WITH YOUR WITH THIS AUTHOR HERE SO -- BUT I BUT I WOULD JUST SAY TO TO TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE FOLKS WITH CONCERNS AND LET'S LET'S GET SOME TRANSPARENCY AROUND THIS AND SEE IF WE CAN'T. SURE LOOK AT THAT BROADER IMPACTED THE SENATOR MENTIONED AND MAKE SURE WE KEEP THIS REGION. PRISTINE. WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT HERE WE CAN WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE I THINK BETWEEN NOW AND APPROPRIATIONS IF THAT'S AMENABLE. THAT THAT WORK IN A PROCEDURALLY TELL ME IF I'M.

INAPPROPRIATE IT IS SU HAVE UNTRAINED PEOPLE WORKING IN THESE LANDSCAPES AS SAYS IT'S NOT WHAT CALIFORNIA DESERVES. IT'S GOING TO JUST KEEP INCREASING THE DISASTER MùT THAT WERE IN. AND SO IT TO HAVE A TWO YEAR CURRICULUM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A PHD TO DO THIS WORK BUT YOU DO NEED TO BE EDUCATED. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND POLICY YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO COLLABORATE. YOU NEED TO TYPICALLY IMPORTANT AND COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE IN THE WE WE AND IN MORE URBANIZED AREAS TO BE ABLE. TO TRAIN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS INDEFENSIBLE SPACE -- REQUIREMENTS UNDER CALIFORNIA EXISTING LAW TO BE ABLE TO HARDEN THOSE HOMES AND PROTECT THEM FROM FIRES BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO DO THE LANDSCAPERS ALLEGIANCE WORK. SO JUST AT THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS THAT. GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AN EMERGENCY PROCULUS PROCLAMATION GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS SIGNED A NEW FIRE WHILE FIRE RELATED EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION. THAT BASICALLY EXEMPTS CALIFORNIA FROM ITS PREMIERE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION STATUTE. CALLS OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD. TO DO THE WORK. IF I COULD DEFINE DESPERATE SOME OTHER WAY I WOULD BET THAT IS SOUNDING PRETTY DESPERATE TO ME. AND SO THIS RESTORATION WORK FORCE WERE HELP US GAIN THAT RESILIENCY BUT HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL SKILL TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK AND DO IT RIGHT. TO UNDERSTAND THE ECOLOGY OF THE ECOSYSTEMS. WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES? AND TO I MEAN MOVES ON TO THE NEXT YEAR. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WITNESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY THANK YOU -- GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS LINDA QUINN DAVIDSON AND I'M UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ONLY FIRED VISOR. IN THE STATE -- BASED IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND AYE AYE SIR FOR COUNTIES UP IN THE NORTH COAST -- AND WE ALL KNOW WE'RE AT A CRITICAL TIME FOR FIRE WE'VE HEARD I THIS MORNING QUITE A BIT. AND WE HAVE A REALLY URGENT NEED TO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND TO MAKE OUR LANDSCAPES MORE RESILIENT -- IN THE LAST YEARS OF REALLY HIT THAT HARD AND SHOWN US THAT NO PLACE IN CALIFORNIA'S A MUTUAL WILD FIRE -- THESE ARE ISSUES THAT REALLY AFFECT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE IN A REALLY UNIQUE POSITION BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF FUNDING RIGHT NOW FOR FIRE MITIGATION AND SHE WAS REDUCTION WORK. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF PUBLIC SUPPORT AND SOCIAL LICENSE AND I THINK WE HAVEN'T HAD -- TO THIS EXTENT FOR A LONG TIME BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE THE TRAINED WORK FORCE TO DO THE WORK. AND SO MANY OF US WHO WORK ON THE SHOES ON THESE ISSUES REALLY SEE OF BUILDING CAPACITY AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS A TOP PRIORITY. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE CALIFORNIA REALLY NEEDS A COORDINATED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AROUND FIRE -- WE WE NEED THIS TO SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND OUR FORESTS AND WATERSHEDS AND SO WITHIN SB FOUR SIXTY TWO IS A PLAN TO DEVELOP A NETWORK OF FIRE ADVISERS LIKE MYSELF. AND OTHER EXPERTS -- TO WORK DIRECTLY ON ON FIRE SO I'M HERE TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AND MAYBE HELP YOU ALL SEE WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW BUT YOU SEE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IS IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA BOTH RURAL AND URBAN. AND WE HAVE A ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX YEAR PARTNERSHIP -- BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTIES AND SO WE LINKED TOGETHER TO BRING -- SCIENCE BASED INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES AND ON AND ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS AND FOCUSED ON ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC RESILIENCY. AND WE ALSO HAVE EXTENSIVE NETWORK THE VOLUNTEERS THAT ARE PART OF OUR PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF FOR H. A MASTER GARDENERS AS OUR PROGRAMS TO COME OUT OF OUR OFFICES -- SO AS AN EXTENSION FIRE ADVISER I HOST A LOT OF WORKSHOPS AND TRAININGS I DO RESEARCH -- I ALSO WORK ON POLICY BARRIERS FOR LANDOWNERS AND LAND MANAGERS HE'S OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT WE DO AS ADVISORS. AND SO JUST FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND IN THIS JOB I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS OF GRANT FUNDING TO THE COUNTIES THAT I WORK IN. OPPOSED TO DOZENS OF WORKSHOPS AND TRAIN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND PRESCRIBED FIRE AND FUELS REDUCTION SO JUST IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE HAD A NETWORK OF FOLKS LIKE ME THROUGHOUT THE STATE I ACTUALLY TRAVEL A LOT TO OTHER PARTS THE STATE TO FILL THOSE NEEDS BECAUSE WE JUST. DON'T HAVE IT WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY -- AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST EXAMPLE OF LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS LIKE THIS THAT WOULD THAT COULD -- FUND PROGRAMS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OTHER -- OVER A COUPLE OF OTHERS OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THAT WERE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL AND AND TIME LEAVE TO ADDRESS REALLY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS SO.

THIS FUND HAS PROTECTED MORE THAN MILLION ACRES -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING HABITAT FOR DEER MOUNTAIN LIONS THREATENED SPECIES WETLANDS AQUATIC AND RIPARIAN HABITAT IN CORRIDORS. THE EXPENDITURES ARE EVENLY DIVIDED AS WELL BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S SOME REGIONAL DIVIDE HERE -- BUT WE'VE INCREDIBLE TRULY GRATEFUL FOR EVERYONE -- SNAPPING UP THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND WHAT'S BEEN ADDED A TRULY LANDMARK CONSERVATION PROGRAM. WITH THAT ASPECT YES FOR AYE VOTE -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] I AM. GOOD MORNING MR MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS FRED HOLES STAFF COUNSEL FROM HOMELAND FOUNDATION. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK -- IN SUPPORT OF EXTENDING HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND. THE MODELING FOUNDATION WAS ORGANIZED TO SPONSOR THE WILDLIFE PROTECTION ACT OF NINETEEN NINE THIS PROP ONE SEVENTEEN TO PROTECT MOUNTAIN LIONS FOR SUPPORT TRAINING. AND JUST ESTABLISH THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND. WE CLOSELY FOLLOW THE IMPACT THAT POPULATION INCREASES IN DEVELOPMENT OF HAD ON MOUNTAIN LIONS FISH WILDLIFE AND HABITAT IN CALIFORNIA. THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PROP ONE SEVENTEEN ARE AS RELEVANT TODAY AS THEY ARE WHEN THEY'RE PROVE ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO. SELECT IT BRIEFLY STATE. PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT AND RESTORATION OF WILDLIFE HABITAT AND FISHERIES ARE VITAL TO MAINTAINING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THE STATE'S HUMAN POPULATION INCREASES THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PROTECT THE RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING WILDLIFE HABITATS THE SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUE AND VERY WILDLIFE RESOURCES. AND THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO. IF WE ARE TO GROW. AND PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE SHARE WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA. THIS ANNUAL EXPENDITURE OF THIRTY MILLION IS SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE STATE. AND WORKS OUT TO JUST SEVENTY FIVE CENTS PER CALIFORNIA AND PER YEAR. THE GENERATION AGO VOTERS CREATED HABITAT CONSERVATION CONSERVATION FUND TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE. THEY ALSO GAVE US THE OP RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW WHAT IS ACCOMPLISHED AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO USE THE FUND TO PROTECT AND RESTORE WILDLIFE HABITAT. AND FISHERIES IN CALIFORNIA GOING FORWARD. ON JUST ONE RECENT EXAMPLE OF SUCCESS. IS -- JUST LAST FALL. THERE WERE -- THE MOUNTAINS RECREATION CONSERVATION AUTHORITY WAS ABLE TO ACQUIRE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ACRES OF TRIANGLE RANCH. IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS. AND THIS ACQUISITION PROTECTED WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND HABITAT. AS WELL AS PROVIDING A PUBLIC ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE FUND IS PROVEN TO BE ADAPTABLE AND VITAL SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IT'S BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE WILDLIFE AND HABITAT. MADELINE FOUNDATION THERE FOR JUST A YES VOTE ON THIS BEFORE. SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS EMILY SERVER OWN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. FOUR SEVENTY FOUR I WANTED TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THE AMAZING BREATH OF WHAT'S BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND. WITHIN THE DISTRICTS REPRESENTED BY THIS COMMITTEE ALONE OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN SPENT NEARLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES HAVE BEEN CONSERVE SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY EXAMPLES OF SUCH EXPENDITURES INCLUDE PROJECTS LIKE THE SAN FELIPE WILDLIFE AREA ACQUISITION AND RESTORATION PROJECT IN CENTER JONES IS DISTRICT. A CRITICAL LINKAGES THAT SUPPORTS MOUNTAIN LION BOBCAT GRAY FOX GOLDEN EAGLE MOUNTING STAKE MIGRATORY BIRDS AND UPLAND GAME BIRDS SUCH AS DOVE AND QUAIL. ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND CENTER A COUPLE YEARS DISTRICT IS THE LOS BONOS WILDLIFE ISLAND WETLAND ENHANCEMENT PROJECT WHICH INVOLVED A COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY JOINT HABITAT VENTURE TO ENHANCE SEASONAL WETLANDS AND IMPROVE WATER. DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE. THROW ALL OF CALIFORNIA THE AGE THAT HAS INVESTED INVESTED MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE PAST THIRTY YEARS IN PROTECTING MORE THAN MILLION ACRES WITH THOUSANDS OF COMPLETED PROJECTS. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE H. C. F. HAS LED TO THE ACQUISITION OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF DEAR AMOUNT LAND HABITAT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND ACRES OF ENDANGERED SPECIES HABITAT. TWO HUNDRED NINETY ONE THOUSAND ACRES OF WETLANDS HABITAT THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRES AQUATIC RIPARIAN HABITAT. AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF WHILE THE QUARTERS AND TRAILS. AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE WE'RE OF COURSE VERY INTERESTED IN PROTECTING HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE HOWEVER I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THESE DOLLARS HAVE GONE TOWARDS PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT PEOPLE. TO SUCH AS WELL IN WATERSHED RESTORATION PROJECTS WITH WATER QUALITY BENEFITS ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND IMPROVED OUTDOOR ACCESS AND TRAIL RESTORATION PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY AS ALREADY MENTIONED EIGHT SEVEN VESTMENTS ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OF PROJECTS RANGING FROM FISHERIES AND FOR US RESTORATION RURAL PARTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. REFUGE RECIRCULATION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TRAIL RESTORATION URBAN AREAS SUCH AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD GRAMMAR SEE PARK IN SOUTH LA. TIDAL MARSH RESTORATION ALONG THE COAST AND HOBBY -- DESERT LAND PROTECTION. AS YOU CAN SEE THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND HAS BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PAY AS WE GO PROGRAM FOR IMPLEMENTING A WIDE RANGE OF VITAL CONSERVATION EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE.

MORNING NO -- CREAMERS OF CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER IN -- TO TRUST MY POSITION BUT THIS BILL JUST WAS IN PRINT YESTERDAY -- SO. OUR CONCERN LIES SOLELY WITH THE FUNDING FOR ACQUISITION -- AND WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH CONTINUING FUNDING FOR RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT -- BUT THE CHALLENGES THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS A SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TWENTY BILLION OF THAT IS FOR NON TRANSPORTATION RELATED PROJECTS. WHAT HAPPENS IS THE STATE IS -- GRANTED EITHER THROUGH A FUN LIKE TO HAVE THAT. FUND OR THROUGH BONDS MONEY TO ACQUIRE LAND BUT THERE IS NO MONEY TO MANAGE THAT LAND AFTER IT'S ACQUIRED AND SO ONCE THE GOVERNMENT OWNS THAT LAND OFTENTIMES THOSE VALUES FOR WHICH THE PROPERTY WAS ACQUIRED -- DISAPPEAR BECAUSE OF THE POOR MANAGEMENT GOING FORWARD SO. WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND INSTEAD AND WOULD ALLOW US TO REMOVE OPPOSITION IS I'M ADJUSTING THE FUNDS SO THAT? ALLOWED FOR ACQUISITION THROUGH THE USE OF CONSERVATION EASEMENTS RATHER THAN FEE TITLE ACQUISITION I'M AND THEN ALSO FUNDING FOR THE RESTORATION HAND SMIT. I'M IF IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW US. TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TO CENTER SERVES BILL. SO YOU COULD YOU COULD DO THAT WITH -- QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. CENTER STERN WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE OPPOSITION IN AND LET US KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT YET. SHE TO THE FEEDBACK AND AND THIS IS -- RELATIVELY RECENT SO -- WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DIGEST IT BUT I THINK I'VE NO VERSION. TO WORKING ON THE ELIGIBILITY OF SOME OF MANAGEMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT THESE ACQUISITIONS ARE ACTUALLY PROPERLY ACHIEVING THE BENEFITS THAT THEIR THEIR THEIR INTENDED TO ACHIEVE SO. EL ALL CONTINUE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ARE MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TODAY AND CERTAINLY FIFTIES MOVES ON TO APPROPRIATIONS AT I'D LOVE TO CHAT MORE WITH THE FARM BUREAU JUST DRILL DOWN WHAT THEY'RE THINKING IN THAT. A LITTLE MORE ON THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG TO THAT IS GOING TO BE WHAT SOUNDS LIKE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE YET. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TWENTY BILLION. IS IN REFERENCE TO IS THAT AS THE IT'S A STATEWIDE SORT OF OVERALL STARTED TO CALL YOU BACK UP I JUST WANT. TO SET. I'M OUTLINED FOUNDATION QUESTIONS OF HE OKAY COME BACK UP TO THAT DEGREE. THAT WAS IN THE LA OWES REPORT TIME THAT THEY DID FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IT WENT OVER SO SEVENTY BILLION TOTAL. TWENTY BILLION OF THAT IS NON TRANSPORTATION RELATED FUNDS. YEAH. OKAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU GREAT LET'S DRAW DOWN SOME MORE THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DANCE BEFORE I MAKE MY COMES. JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE MELLON FOUNDATION ACTUALLY IS UNRELATED TO THE TO THE BILL BUT IT CAME UP IN THE AND IT AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT. DO YOU HAVE ANY NUMBERS ON THE NUMBER OF MOUNTAIN LIONS -- PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY THAT WERE HUNTED ANNUALLY VERSES THE NUMBER OF MOUNT LANES TODAY THAT ARE TAKEN BY TRADITION PERMITS -- I CANNOT SPEAK AT THE EXAM. ACTUAL SPORT HUNTING OF MOUNTAIN LIONS WAS MADE PERMANENT TO PROPOSITION -- ONE SEVENTEEN IT HAD BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW BY RONALD REAGAN EARLIER. SO THAT WAS QUITE A PERIOD OF TIME. THAT THE NINETY WOULD HAVE BEEN -- GOVERNOR WILSON ONE OF THE RIGHT BUT I'M THE SPORT HUNTING WAS OUTLAWED MUCH EARLIER AND THERE WAS MOVEMENT TO BRING IT BACK AND SO THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE INITIATIVE WAS TO MAKE THE BAND PERMANENTLY -- OKAY AND AND REALLY THE THE THE POINT OF MY PURSES I ASSUME CONSTITUENTS AND BRING THIS UP. AND OFTEN TO MEAN I HAVE TO ADDRESS IN MY DISTRICT AND THEN THE NUMBER THAT I'VE BEEN QUOTED IS PRIOR TO THE OUTLAW OF MOUNT LINE HUNTING THERE WAS ABOUT. FORTY FIVE MOUNTAIN LIONS HUNTED ANNUALLY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AFTER THE PROHIBITION ONE IN A PLACE THERE'S ABOUT FORTY FIVE MOUNTAIN LANDS THAT ARE KILLED EACH YEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY LICENSED PETITION. PERMIT HOLDERS DOES THAT NUMBER TO THOSE NUMBERS SOUND THERE ARE ACCURATELY -- THINK IT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED PER YEAR SEVERAL HUNDRED FOR YOUR ARE TAKEN BY TRADITION -- UNDER DEPOSITION PERMITS I CAN GET YOU THAT DEPOSITION I'M SORRY I'M TAKEN I'M USING THE WRONG TERM BECAUSE THAT PARTITION YOU'RE RIGHT WAS QUITE A FEW TO SEPARATION PERMITS AS WELL AS ON TRAFFIC. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE IMPACT AREAS OKAY. AND I I APOLOGIZE. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE YOUR BILL IF YOU COULD SEND MY OFFICE SOME INFORMATION THAT AND WE CERTAINLY DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT WAY I CAN JUST ADDRESS IT TO MY CONSTITUENTS THAT BRING IT UP QUITE A BIT -- MY CONCERN WAS ALSO THE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE IN OUR STATE PARKS AND YOU KNOW OTHER. IT'S IT' A RELATED BUT I'M RELATED TO THIS YOU KNOW I I GET THAT I THINK THE FARM BUREAU ACCURATELY -- ADDRESS MY CONCERNS AS THE ONLY OFF TODAY -- BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE FARMING OMINOUS SUPPORT TO BUILD THANK YOU -- AND OBVIOUS ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME THING THANK A WITH DOWN AYE. GIVEN OPPORTUNITY CLOSE. PREVIEW THE FEEDBACK ONE IRON THIS OUT -- AS BEST WE CAN BEFORE HOPEFULLY THE FLOOR -- WILL NEED ALL YOUR SUPPORT GOING FORWARD I THINK THIS EXTENSION THIS IS A IMPORTANT YOUR TO DO IT. THE DILIGENCE HAS BEEN DONE -- NOT TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG I DON'T THINK WE CAN TACKLE IT ALL HERE TODAY BUT IT'S A HUGE ISSUE -- AND SO FOR ALL NOT JUST THE SPECIES IN THE HABITAT FOR THE BUT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO STILL LOVE WILDNESS IN THEIR LIVES SAID RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A PRIVATE. THIS MONEY YOU'RE MOTIONS TO DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS ALL RIGHT. SENATOR STERN AYE STERN AYE JONES I JONES I ALLEN FORGES CABALLERO. HERTZBERG. HUESO. HUESO AYE JACKSON MONEY. MONEY NINE THAT'S ON CALL. FOR MR STERN YOUR OF BILLS ON CALL FOR AYE VOTES I SEE. IN A RUBIO IN THE HOUSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE FOR PRISON NEXT. FOR MORE BUILT FOR THE CLOSEST. ABSOLUTELY. WHAT? WHAT WHAT COMMITTEES I MIGHT HAVE A BILL UP THERE TO ELECTION? YEAH. SB. SIX SIX EIGHT THAT ONE MORE TIME FILE AND FOURTEEN SENATOR RUBIO SB. SIX SIX EIGHT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB SIX SIX EIGHT A BILL RELATING TO DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND WATER SYSTEMS. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE SOME PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH I WILL GLADLY ACCEPT THAT WOULD REQUIRE ALL URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS TO CREATE AN UPDATE -- DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PLANS CALIFORNIA WATER CODE. ONE ZERO SIX ONE SEVEN DEFINES AN URBAN WATER SUPPLIER AS A SUPPLIER EITHER PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY A PRIVATELY OWNED PROVIDING WATER FOR MUNICIPAL PURPOSES. EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS FOR SUPPLYING MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. ANNUALLY MORE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD DO THE FOLLOWING TWO THINGS FIRST IT WOULD REQUIRE URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS TO UPDATE THEIR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PLAN. NO LESS THAN ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. SECOND IT WOULD CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WATER AGENCIES MUST COMPLY WITH THE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PLAN. FROM PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS WITH TEN THOUSAND FOR MORE SERVICE CONNECTIONS TO URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS. FURTHER THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES MUST CREATE ITS OWN EMERGENCY PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH THE SAME PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM SB SIX SIX EIGHT HELPS PREPARE THE STATE FOR DISASTERS. BY EQUIRING. I'M SORRY BY REQUIRING ALL URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS TO KEEP THEIR SYSTEMS PREPARED FOR THE WORST -- HERE WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE JACK HAWKS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS JENNIFER COMPETE TO LOW ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE COMPANY HERE TO TESTIFY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MY NAME IS JACK WALKS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION -- SB SIX SIX EIGHT WAS PROMPTED BY. MANY THE WILD FIRES THE LAST THREE YEARS IN A DEVASTATING IMPACT THEY HAD ON A NUMBER OF OUR MEMBER UTILITIES AND THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THEY HAVE HAD -- TO ACTIVATE THEIR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER IS MUCH MORE OFTEN THAN ANY WHAT HE WOULD LIKE -- TO HAVE TO DO AND THAT IS PROMPTED TO CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION ON THE THESE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS. AND WHAT THIS BILL SO THAT WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP FORWARD AND AND WILD FIRE MITIGATION AND IMPROVING THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROCESS. THIS BILL WILL DO TWO THINGS FIRST IT WILL -- PUT. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE ON A PAR. WITH THE OTHER FOUR MAJOR REQUIREMENTS OF URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS -- RIGHT NOW -- ONE OF THEM IS THE NEW CONSERVATION REGULATIONS -- THAT WERE PASSED LAST YEAR ANOTHER ONE IS THE URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN SAID URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS HAVE TO SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THE THIRD ONE IS THE WATER SHORTAGE CONTINGENCY PLANS THAT HAVE TO BE PREPARED. AND THE LAST ONE IS THE METERING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE COMING DUE ALL OF THOSE -- APPLY TO URBAN WATER SUPPLIERS THIS WILL NOW TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IT SHOULD BE RIGHT THERE WITH THE OTHERS THE OTHER THING THIS IS BILL'S GOING TO DO IS TO HELP INSTITUTIONALIZE. A GROWING -- PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA. WHY -- WATER WASTEWATER AGENCY RESPONSE NETWORK CAL WORN. AND A NUMBER OF WATER SUPPLIERS ESPECIALLY SMALLER ONES AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THIS. PROGRAM -- IT'S A MUTUAL AID ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AMONGST REGIONAL WATER. SUPPLIERS ALL OVER THE STATE. AND BY HAVING -- THIS BILL IN STATUTE IT WILL ENABLE THESE WATER SUPPLIERS TO INCORPORATE CAL WORN INTO THEIR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLANS THAT CAN ONLY BE GOOD SO -- WITH ALL OF THAT I WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. JENNIFER COMPETE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE COMPANY THE SECOND LARGEST PUBLIC UNDER FIRE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SERVING A LITTLE OVER TWO MILLION -- THANKS -- WATER WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY A LOT OF THE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS FIRST BY THE SKIN FIRING KERN COUNTY -- THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE IN LAKE COUNTY THE CAMPFIRE AND PARADISE AND THE WALLS THE FIRE AND THOUSAND OAKS -- AND AT THE-HEIGHT OF THE WILL THE FIRE THE FIRE FIGHTERS WILL TOTALING FIVE TIMES MORE THAN THE AVERAGE DAILY USE OF WATER -- FOR FIRE FIGHTING CAPABILITIES THERE -- FORTUNATELY CAO WATER WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTERS ON THE WHOLESALE WATER PROVIDER TO GET. THERE WATER FACILITIES REFILLED AND THAT WAS REALLY BECAUSE THEY HAD A SOLID DISASTER PREPAREDNESS PLAN IN PLACE THEY KNEW HOW WHO TO CONTACT. AND THEY WORKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS TO BRING A MERGING SEE EQUIPMENT AND PORTABLE GENERATORS OVER FIFTY MILES -- TWO THOUSAND OAKS TO HELP GET. THE TANK BACK UP IN FULL AND GET WATER PUMPING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM AGAIN FOR FIRE FIGHTING EFFORTS SO. THEY FEEL LIKE THIS IS LIKE JACK SAID THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP. AND RECOGNIZING THE ROLE BETWEEN WATER SUPPLIERS AND FIRE FIGHTING CAPABILITIES AND JUST REALLY DEALING WITH ANY OTHER DISASTERS THAT COULD COME A LONG WAY AS WELL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COMMENTS FROM THE DíAS. WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. NO QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS THANK YOU. FOR IN THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED CORRECT. RIGHT TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU. SENATORS STERN JONES HI JONES I ALLEN FORGES CABALLERO HERTZBERG HUESO. FIVE HUESO AYE JACKSON MONNING. MONEY HI THE BILL IS ON CALL THREE VOTES. YOU HAVE THREE AYE VOTES IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE DíAS HERE SO. WE'LL KEEP ON CALL FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS TO COME OUT ON THANK YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. I WAS LOOKING FOR AN AUTHOR TO PRESENT NEXT WILL THAT WILL TAKE SENATOR MINING. SB TWO HUNDRED ITEM NUMBER TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN MEMBER -- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE AND NOW SUS WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS ISSUE. AS MANY OF YOU ARE NOW WELL AWARE THEY'RE CLOSE TO ONE MILLION OF OUR NEIGHBORS AND CONSTITUENTS WHO LIVE EACH DAY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO DRINK THE WATER. COMING OUT OF THEIR TAPS. THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY WHERE WE BOASTS THRIVING TECH INDUSTRIES HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL PROGRAMS WE STILL HAVE FAMILIES AND OVER THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES. FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO THE MEXICAN BORDER FOR FORCED TO BUY BOTTLED WATER TO DRINK BAYS AND TO COOK WITH. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS LONG CALLED FOR THE CREATION OF A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO ADDRESS THE LONGSTANDING GAPS IN FUNDING FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER NEEDS. THAT CANNOT BE FUNDED THROUGH EXISTING BOND FUNDS. SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED TAKES AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. IN REACHING THAT GOAL BY CREATING THIS SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE WATER BOARD. OF THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU TODAY DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC FUNDING SOURCE THAT WILL SOLVE THE DRINKING WATER CRISIS IT DOES CREATED NEEDED FRAMEWORK FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO RECEIVE IT MINISTER. AND DISTRIBUTE FUTURE REVENUES AND RESPONSIBLE AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER THAT WILL PRIORITIZE SOLUTIONS FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY UNSAFE IN ON AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. ALL DISCUSSIONS ON HOW TO ESTABLISH A LONG TERM AND SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER OUR ON GOING. SENATE BILL TWO HUNDRED IS A CRITICAL PART IN ESTABLISHING THE STRUCTURE AND FRAMEWORK AND NEEDED TO GET THE FUNDS TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE GREATEST NEED. SPECTER THE ASKS THAT YOU JOIN ME IN THIS IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FINALLY REALIZING THE HUMAN RIGHT TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. IN CALIFORNIA WITH YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT OUR TWO WITNESSES JENNIFER CLARY WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION. AND MELISSA ROMERO LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS MANAGER WITH. HI MY NAME'S JENNIFER CLARION THE WATER PROGRAM MANAGER FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION FOR THE PAST SIXTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES. I'VE TRACKED IT CLEAN WATER AND SAFE DRINKING WATER FUNDS I'VE TRACKED PROP FIFTY EIGHTY FOUR ONE IN. SIXTY EIGHT AND I DO WE'VE DONE A LOT WE'VE ACTUALLY. YEAH YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY BACK A PLANNING LOAN IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY I MEAN IT USED TO BE REALLY BAD. BUT YOU SEE WE STILL HAVE THESE PROBLEMS THAT SEEM INSOLVABLE SO EMERGENCY FUNDING YEAH HE'S PORTERFIELD WAS LUCKY BECAUSE WE HAD A DROUGHT AND SO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. WAS ABLE TO COME IN AND PROVIDE INTERIM DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES TO THAT COMMUNITY WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF WATER -- LONG TERM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SO OFTEN WE GET FUNDING TO SOLVE A COMMUNITY PROBLEM WITHIN THEIR WATER BILLS AND THAT BEING BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. WHICH A COMMUNITY WITH AN INCOME OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE CAN'T AFFORD AND THEN. THE OTHER IDEA IS HOW DO WE TAKE CARE PEOPLE ARE SERVED BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM THAT'S BETWEEN A MILLION AND A HALF IN TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS WE DON'T EVEN COUNT THEM AND WE HAVE HOPE COMMUNITIES. IN THE CHOI LIKE BASS AND THEY DID A SURVEY. ALMOST 30% OF THE HOME CLUSTERS THEY FOUND THEIR OF AT LEAST FIFTEEN HOMES THE DEFINITION OF A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. BUT THEY WERE SERVED BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS YET CAN TO COMMUNITY SIDE BY SIDE ONE QUALIFIES FOR ASSISTANCE AND THE OTHER DOESN'T EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SIMILAR WATER NEEDS. SO THE THIS. THAT PROGRAM DEVELOPED -- OUTLINED IN SB TWO HUNDRED REALLY IS LOOKING TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS AS THEY COME UP AND PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY SO WE CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT TODAY THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO COME UP TOMORROW BECAUSE THOSE. THOSE PROBLEMS CHANGE ALL THE TIME SO THERE'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE RIGHT NOW WELL THERE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. TWENTY NINE HUNDRED OF THEM A COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE DRINKING WATER TO RESIDENTS AND SO. WE THINK THREE HUNDRED TWENTY IS A LOT BUT THERE'S A BIG RESERVOIR SYSTEMS OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT UNDERSTAND EVALUATE AND TRY TO FIX IF NEEDED. AND SO WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR IF YOU HAVE A FLEXIBLE PROGRAM YOU ALSO NEED ONE THAT HAS A LOT OF OVERSIGHT. I THINK THIS THIS LEGISLATION DOES THAT IT REQUIRES AT ADVISORY COMMITTEE A PUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE DIVERSE TO OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND THINKS THE AMENDMENTS FROM YOUR YOUR COMMUNITY IT ALSO REQUIRES -- IT ALSO REQUIRES LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ANNUALLY THANK YOU SO MUCH I HOPE WE GET YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS CALIFORNIA HAS A DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN THIS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT HAS GONE TOO FAR FOR TOO LONG IN THIS GREAT STATE. BUT THIS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS ASTOR HAS SOLUTION AND THAT'S THE CREATION OF A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND. EXPOSURE TO UNSAFE LEVELS OF DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATES CONTAMINANTS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO DESERVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER JUST AS MANY OF US HERE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING WE GO HOME TONIGHT. IT'S UNIMAGINABLE THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN FAMILIES AND DEVELOPING CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA STILL DO NOT HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AT HOME OR AT SCHOOL. THE COMMUNITY MEMBER SUFFERING FROM CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER HAVE COME HERE TO THE STATE CAPITOL YEAR AFTER YEAR ASKING FOR A SOLUTION. AND THEY CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. IN ORDER TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE THE STATE NEEDS A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE THAT WILL PROVIDE COMMUNITIES WITH THOSE MUCH NEEDED DOLLARS FOR OPERATION MAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WHICH IS WHY WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THE COMPLEMENTARY LEGISLATION MOVING TO THE ASEMBLY. WHICH INCLUDES A NECESSARY POLLUTER PAYS FEE INTO A FUN TO GO TOWARDS CLEANING UP THESE CONTAMINATED WATER SYSTEMS.

MISTER RACES AGAIN WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THAT COVERAGE I MEAN FINISHES ITEM ROOM. QUESTION AFTER YOU SIR OKAY GOOD WILL WANT TO GO TO YOU THAN TALKING HONORED DIFFERENT TO DIFFER THANKS. THAT SEEMS TO BE THE THEME TODAY. MISTER MONEY COUPLE CONCERNS -- AS IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY YOUR WITNESSES THE FUNDING MECHANISM -- I RECEIVED A A PRETTY. STRONG LETTER OPPOSITION FROM A COALITION OF WATER AGENCIES IN MY DISTRICT NOT JUST MY DISTRICT BUT THAT REPRESENT -- EVERY SAN DIEGO COUNTY RESIDENT AS A MATTER OF FACT -- BUT I WANT YOU KNOW I AGREE THAT A MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER THAT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE -- THE COULD YOU SPEAK TO THE FUNDING -- SORES AND AND MAYBE -- COMPARED IF YOU CAN IF YOU KNOW THE THE DETAILS -- CENTER CABALLERO HAS A BILL SB SIX SIX NINE THAT KIND OF DOES THE SAME. THING -- AND CAN SPEAK TO THAT GREAT IF YOU CAN HEAR THEM AND I DON'T I'M GLAD. TO SO THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY AS MENTIONED DOES NOT INCLUDE A SPECIFIC FUNDING MECHANISM. HOWEVER THE TRAILER BILL REFERRED -- TO TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. BY THE GOVERNOR THE ARCHITECTURE THAT IS BASED ON A PRIOR BILL TO SB TWO HUNDRED I THINK THAT'S THE FOCUS OF SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. IN THAT ITERATION INCLUDES A RATE PAYER COMPONENT IN AN AGRICULTURAL FENIAN SOME DIFFERENT -- POLLUTANT SOURCES -- THAT SIMEON -- THE UNIVERSE OF LOOKING AT A FUNDING MECHANISM. WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY DOES NOT INCLUDE THAT FUNDING MECHANISM BECAUSE THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES. SIR REAL ENDEAVOR IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. IS ANTICIPATING. AN ULTIMATE SOLUTION ON THE FUNDING SOURCE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ARCHITECTURE WITH STATE WATER BOARD WITH -- CITIZEN OVERSIGHT AND ENGAGEMENT IN THE MECHANICS AND AGAIN WITH THE CHAIR PRESS AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK. YOU IN IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE WORK IN TIGHTENING UP SOME OF THESE MECHANISM SO I THINK THE PROGRESS IN FRONT F YOU TODAY -- IS REALLY ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FUND MAKING SURE THERE'S OVERSIGHT IN IMPLEMENTATION THAT CAN BE DONE IN A MANNER THAT WOULD RETAIN LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK MS CLEAR SHE WITH PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR SHE MIGHT ALSO LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. SO -- THE THERE ARE SEVERAL FUNDING MECHANISMS PROPOSED THE OTHER ONE IN THE SENATE IS SB -- SIX SIX NINE OUR ORGANIZATION HAS AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. MISSION FOR BECAUSE FOR TWO REASONS ONE BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK THE FUNDING MECHANISM. IS REASONABLE BECAUSE WOULD TAKE ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND TO ESTABLISH A TRUST FUND AT THE LEVEL THAT WE THINK IS NEEDED THAT WE'VE DONE RESEARCH ON AND THEN THE OTHER PIECES IT EXCLUDES. DOMESTIC WELLS IN THE STATE'S SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND WE KNOW. YEAH WE'RE NOT PLANNING TO GIVE EVERYONE FREE WATER WE'RE PLANNING TO LOOK AT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES DEPENDENT ON PRIVATE WELLS AND SEEING HOW WE CAN HELP THEM GET SAFE DRINKING WATER -- THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL SAY I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU. BRING POLICY TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE AND LET THE BUDGET WORK AT THE BUDGET STUFF I THINK THAT'S IT I'VE GOT A BILL IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY THAT'S TRYING TO DO THE SAME THING -- ALTHOUGH MY CONSTITUENTS WANT ME TO OPPOSE THE BILL I'M JUST GONNA LAY OFF TODAY I THINK. AGAIN I AGREE WITH YOU A MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT WATER IS ACCEPTABLE. SHE THAT AGAIN. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AGAIN WITH THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR TIGHTENING IT UP IN I'M. WE WILL BE COMMUNICATING WITH EVERYBODY AS WE MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A SPECIAL THANK YOU. TO COMMITTEE CONSULTANT. I THINK IT'S SAME INTENT. LOT OF THE SAME MECHANICS BUT JUST IT IT IT IT. READS CLEAR I THINK YEAH I I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF AND YOU ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS I DID WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE SO I I KNOW WE DIDN'T DRILL DOWN. DEEPLY ON SOME OF THESE -- THESE ADDITIONAL ATTENTION ISSUES BUT AND I AND I KNOW WORK IN PROGRESS BUT CAN YOU KIND OF UPDATE US OR IN IN TERMS OF YOUR THINKING. I'LL JUST FLAG A FEW BUT THE THE REGIONAL EQUITY QUESTION. SERVICE HAS THINKING O ALL OF THEIR THERE'S A MENTION ABOUT THESE COMPLIANT BUT REALLY EXPENSIVE SYSTEMS TRYING TO THINK UP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND THEN THIS. THIS -- THERE THERE'S A FEW OTHERS BUT LOW INCOME WATER USERS. I I'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH HOW. TO TRY TO TACKLE THE THE RATE SIDE OF THINGS -- AND WHAT WHERE THEY FIT SO YESTERDAY SO LET ME TAKE A PERSON BACK AND THEN WOULD ALSO LIKE TO INVITE OUR WITNESSES IF THEY WANT TO WEIGH IN ON IT -- AND I DO APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE ISSUES SO THE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY -- WE THINK IS BUILT IN BECAUSE THE PRIVATIZATION OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND YOU'RE GONNA FIND THOSE FROM THE OREGON BORDER TO THE MEXICO BORDER. YOU SOME PEOPLE THINK THIS IS JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY PROBLEM IT'S NOT THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF THESE THREE HUNDRED PLUS WATER SYSTEMS. IS BY DEFINITION. THEY ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE INCOME ISN'T ENOUGH. TO REMEDIATE OR PROVIDE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. BASED ON THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR WATER RATES SO. YOU COULD PUT WATER RATES UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH IN THOSE WATER BILLS WOULDN'T GET PAID. AND THOSE REPAIRS WOULD BE IN DEFAULT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A FALL CALIFORNIANS JOIN HANDS. PITCH IN A DE MINIMUS AMOUNT. WE CAN ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. PRIORITIZING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED IN THE BILL -- IN IS UNDERSTOOD. BY THE WILL OF THE WATER BOARD -- SO THE GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY IS GOING TO BE ROUTED IN THE ECONOMIC EQUITY AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND WELL WON'T BE. IDENTICAL DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE STATE IT WILL BE DISTRIBUTION AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LOW INCOME WATER USERS -- WE EXEMPTS THEM. GETTING INTO OUR FUNDING MECHANISM THAT'S NOT BEFORE YOU TODAY BUT JUST HOW WE TRY. TO BRING SOCIAL EQUITY IN ECONOMIC EQUITY. OUR PRIOR VERSIONS HAVE PROVIDED AN EXEMPTION FOR RATE EARS UP LINE -- COST STOPS THERE -- WE IN THE FUND IT ALLOWS OBVIOUSLY FOR STATE FUNDING FOR FEDERAL FUNDING IT COULD IT COULD ATTRACT NONPROFIT -- CONTRIBUTIONS PHILANTHROPIC CONTRIBUTIONS WE WANT TO CREATE A CATCH ALL. THEN THE DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM IS DEMOCRATIC HAS OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT WE GO FOR WHAT WE CALL THE LOW HANGING FRUIT FIRST WE THINK WITH EARLY INVESTMENT IN. CONNECTING SOME SYSTEMS THAT ARE CLOSE TO A CLEAN WATER SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE THE BEST INVESTMENT OF THOSE DOLLARS AND THE QUICKEST REMEDY FOR THOSE WITHOUT CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. AS YOU GO UP THE LADDER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME MORE THE INNER CORE MORE CAPITAL INVESTMENT. SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SAYS WHY SHOULD THIS FUND TO BE USED FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT. THIS FUND WE WANTED TO BE USED TO GET PEOPLE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER THE BIG GAP HAS BEEN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. BUT IN ONE COMMUNITY THERE MIGHT BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION MIGHT INCLUDE SOME CAPITAL INVESTMENT OUR BILL DOESN'T PRECLUDE THAT BUT LET ME SEE IF MS CURRIE WANTS TO ADD TO ANY OF THAT -- WARMEST ROMERO FROM. CO CV THANKS I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXPENSIVE SYSTEMS HERE TALK ABOUT WATER SYSTEMS. HAVING A LARGE EXPENSE IN DELIVERING WATER AND TYPICALLY WHAT WE WOULD THINK IS THAT THE WATER BOARD USUALLY GIVES OUT CONTRACTS TO ENGINEERS IN THIS CASE OPERATORS TO DO THAT RATHER THAN THE WATER SYSTEM DIRECTLY PAYING FOR IT. YOU ALSO AT THE ANNOUNCES ALSO ASKED ABOUT LOW INCOME RATE PAYERS WHICH ARE FOUND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE BOARD UNDER LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY SET BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DODD -- IN WHAT WAS THAT -- TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN REQUIRES THE STATE TO DEVELOP A LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT ENERGY CUSTOMERS ALREADY HAVE AND THAT WOULD COST BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THE ESTIMATE SO -- WE'RE HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME GETTING THIS AMOUNT SO I THINK WE WANT A LITTLE EXTRA TIME AND THOUGHT ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO FIND. THE INDIVIDUAL RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT'S CONTINUES TO BE RESEARCHED [inaudible] MY MY MY INTEREST IN THAT LOW INCOME RATE ISSUE IS. BABY SOMEONE ABOUT THE STATE WATER BOARD ACTION PENDING BUT ALSO DEPENDING ON THE FUNDING MECHANISM AND HOW THE FINAL VOTE. IS ASSESSED TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY EMPOWER SOME THESE LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO SOLVE. EQUITY CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE GOT THAT WON'T NECESSARILY ADD COSTS TO THE LEGISLATION OR REQUIRE AN APPROPRIATION OR EVEN A STATE FEE BUT TRYING. TO FIND DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF BROADER RATE PRESSURE ISSUE THAT WE HEAR FROM MACH ONE SOME OF THE AGENCIES AND SO. WE WE CAN KEEP SORT OF THAT KEEP THAT ONE ON SIMMER AND AND AND SEE OF THIS THING INVOLVES BUT I I'M I'M I'M C&lt;c.cyan&gt; INTERESTED IN&lt;/c&gt; THAT AND THEN. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE ON THIS LOW HANGING FRUIT A HOW DO WE SCOPE THAT THEN THE SENATOR PUT IT WELL BUT LIKE MORE GRANULARITY ABOUT. WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WHAT WHAT WE COULD ANTICIPATE COMING WITH A MECHANISM WE'VE GOT IN PLACE HERE LIKE WHAT WHAT COULD WE SEE IN THE FIRST? COUPLE YEARS THE PROGRAM WHERE ARE THE SUPER HIGH PRIORITIES OUT THERE WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES KIND OF EMERGES THE AS HE SAID THE LOW HANGING FRUIT FOR NOW I THINK YOU LOOK AT PLACES WHERE YOU ALREADY HAVE INFORMATION SO TWO THINGS ONE IS YOU START GATHERING INFORMATION FOR INSTANCE. ON PRIVATE WELLS SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND AREAS THAT MIGHT NEED A WARNING. LETTER TO GO OUT NEXT YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT THE SENATOR REFER TO WHICH IS CONSOLIDATION. AND THERE ARE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY CALIFORNIA GROWS IT'S GROWN AROUND THE SMALL COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES SO THERE ARE SOME CITIES. THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY A SMALL WATER SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE AND THOSE COULD BE EASILY HOOKED UP SOME. AS SIMPLE AS JUST TURNING AT PIPE THE TURNING ON A THINK IT AND OTHERS A SMALL PIPE OTHERS IT'S A LTTLE MORE EXPENSIVE YOU HAVE. TO BUILD A LONGER PIPELINE. BUT I THINK THAT IDEAS SOME OF THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE INAPPROPRIATE SHOULD PROBABLY NO LONGER EXIST AND THE STATE BOARD THE LEGISLATURE GAVE YOU GAVE THEM. THE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE CONSOLIDATION AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE ONLY MANDATED A HANDFUL OF CONSOLIDATIONS THAT THREAT HAS LED TO A HUNDRED CONSOLIDATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. SO IT IS HAPPENING NOW AND HAVING MORE MONEY TO HELP PAY FOR THE COST OF CONNECTION WILL HELP SPUR MORE I THINK OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND WHILE I'VE GOT YOU HERE THOUGHTS ON THE THE COMMENTS AND ADDITIONAL LONG TERM SOLUTIONS OPEN THIS THERE AND THEN ON THE NONPROFIT DEFINITION. I I DON'T NEED TO HOLD YOU TO IT TODAY I JUST WANT TO GET SOME FEEDBACK ON THE RECORD LOW WE GOT WHAT WE GOT SOME EXPERTS IN THERE SO WHAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION SIR -- FIRST ON THE SORT OF LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND THE SCOPE OF WHAT. YOU ARE THINK OUGHT TO BE ELIGIBLE IN IN THERE. I THINK IT'S ALL DRINKING WATER A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES IN IN THIS ELECTION ON LONG TERM DRINKING WATER SOLUTIONS BUT THE ANALYSIS MENTIONS. WASTE WATER TREATMENT OTHERS OR TO IMPACTS. I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE OF HOW I THINK I THINK WHAT WE WANT IS TO BE EXPANSIVE AND FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT'S TRUE THAT -- FAILING WASTE WATER AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS DO CONTAMINATE WATER SUPPLIES IN SOME AREAS SO THAT COULD BE SOMETHING I THINK THAT IT'S ALREADY PERMITTED BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE AGAIN. TO MAKE IT MORE -- HERE AND THE SAME WITH THE DEFINITION OF NONPROFIT WHAT WE WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW TO DO THE JOB AND ARE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN DO IT. AND HAVE THE HAVE THE FISCAL -- CAPACITY TO BE RESPONSIBLE. PARTNERS -- WITH. I THINK WE'VE WAITED ALL OUT HERE PRETTY WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR JUST DILIGENCE ON THIS THE FEEDBACK WE'RE GONNA STAFF SO LET'S KEEP WORKING ON THIS I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING THIS YEAR. THIS IS YEAH WE WE WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF SAID WELL. MAYBE I'LL JUST MAKE THIS MY CLOTHES IF YOU SEE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME -- THERE'S A LOT OF FORCES PUSHING IN THE SAME DIRECTION RIGHT NOW WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY THE GOVERNOR'S SUPPORT FOR SOLUTION. LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES -- AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP PUSHING AND MANY OF SAID THIS IS THE YEAR TO GET IT DONE SO WE SEE THIS AS A VEHICLE TO KEEP THAT MOMENTUM GOING. I ALSO JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MANY ORGANIZATIONS TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT TODAY THERE'S BEEN. A GROWING COALITION FROM. TO RURAL FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO AGRICULTURE -- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE PUSHING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- THEIR CONTINUED COMMITMENT AND PERSEVERANCE AND WITH THAT WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] YEAH. I'M SORRY SENATE ALLEN YOU WANT TO I JUST WANT TO COMMEND AND CENTER MINE FOR THIS BILL AND I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'RE. TAKING THE RIGHT APPROACH HERE BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES INVOLVE COMPREHENSIVE. ADDRESSING OF THE OF THIS ENORMOUS NEED AND IT'S IT'S APPALLING THAT WE HAVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE IS -- AS PROGRESSIVE AS WE ARE IN AND SO -- I JUST COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ANDERSON IS CAN BE A LOT OF NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW OF ALL THE IDEAS OUT HERE I'M I'M MOST ON TRACK WITH YOU. THANK YOU AND THE RIGHT WAS THAT A MOTION YES I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. GOOD -- HAD A CLOSE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK CENTER MINE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL SENATOR STERN HI STERN AYE JONES ALLEN. HI ELLEN AYE FORGES KIRBY EURO HERTZBERG HUESO. HUESO AYE JACKSON JACKSON I'D MONEY. MONEY HI IT HAS FIVE IT IS FIVE IS REALLY THAT MEASURE A CALL THANK CENTER THANK YOU. WE GOT TO EUROPE. ALLEN ALLEN JACKSON JACKSON ALLEN [inaudible] YEAH. ALL RIGHT JUMP UP SENATOR JACKSON'S. I SENSE SOME [inaudible] COMITY. SHE'S TECHNICALLY I'M FOR THINK ABOUT [inaudible] YEAH. RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT IN ORDER FOR FATHER EVER TWELVE CORRECT SB FIVE FIVE ONE THAT IS CORRECT SHOULD STILL MOURNING FEELS LIKE AFTERNOON BUT GOOD GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS - THIS IS A SB. FIVE FIFTY ONE A MEASURE THAT DIRECTS THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES DARKER. TO DEVELOP AN ACCOUNTING MECHANISM FOR ASSESSING THE FULL COSTS. OF DECOMMISSIONING CLEANING UP. AND REMOVING REMEDIATING OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR STATE. IN SHORT THIS BILL DIRECTS DOCTOR TO GET IN FRONT OF A PROBLEM THAT WITH NO QUESTION. WILL RESULT IN ILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LIABILITIES TO THE GENERAL FUND. UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT FIRST [inaudible] NOW. MEMBERS THE PROBLEM OF UNACCOUNTED FOR OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL. INDEED THERE ARE SEVERAL INDUSTRY TRENDS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY. THAT ARE RESULTING IN STRANDED AND ABANDONED INFRASTRUCTURE. OR IMPROPERLY CLEANED UP IN REMEDIATED OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION SITES. THESE TRENDS NOT ONLY INCLUDE INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE AN ACCELERATED PRODUCTION METHODS. THAT ARE LEAVING SEVERAL WESTERN STATE GOVERNMENT'S HOLDING THE BILL. REGARDLESS OR IF THEY'RE IN COLORADO OR WYOMING THESE. AND ARE RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN STATE. AND THESE TRENDS ALSO INCLUDE AND FACTOR IN OUR OWN AMBITIONS CLIMATE GOALS. WHICH CALL FOR A SWITCH. FROM A OF FOSSIL FUEL BASED ECONOMY TO A FOSSIL FREE. BASED ECONOMY IN A MATTER OF MERE DECADES. AND IT BEARS REPEATING THIS PROBLEM IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. WITH HAVING TO ASSUME THE LIABILITY OF JUST TWO PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE. BOTH IN MY DISTRICT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY ON THE HOOK TODAY. FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND IS LIKELY ON THE HOOK FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MORE. BY THE TIME THE DECOMMISSIONING OF THESE TWO PROJECTS ONE IS PLATFORM HOLLY. IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL OFF OF KALITA. AND THE OTHER IS ON RING CONN ISLAND A MAN MADE ISLAND -- THAT IS -- IN VENTURA COUNTY. THESE PRODUCT THESE BOTH THESE ITEMS BOTH THESE. HUGE INFRASTRUCTURES HAVE DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. AND THE STATE HAS BEEN HANDED BACK THE DEED AND THE LIABILITIES FOR CLEANING UP THE MESS THAT THESE OIL COMPANIES HAVE MADE OVER THE COURSE OF TIME. FROM WHICH THEY HAVE RECEIVED PROFIT IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT I'VE LITERALLY. NOW HELD AND PUT THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING UP THEIR MESS. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS FRUSTRATING. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. NOW GRANTED NOT EVERY PIECE OF OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A LARGE OFFSHORE FACILITY. BUT WITH THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE COST SALINAS INVOLVED WITH REMOVING INDUSTRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S NOT HARD TO IMAGINE. THE SIZEABLE LIABILITIES THAT WE WILL BE FACING IN THE COMING DECADES. BUT I DON'T WANT US TO JUST HAVE TO IMAGINE THOSE ON PLAN LIABILITIES AND BEYOND READY FOR THEM.-WHEN THEY UNEXPECTEDLY HIT OUR GENERAL FUND LIKE A MACK TRUCK? WHAT I INSTEAD ASK IS I BELIEVE EMINENTLY REASONABLE? IT IS FOR OUR PRIMARY REGULATOR OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN THE STATE. TO DEVELOP A FUNCTIONAL MECHANISM. TO ASSESS. THESE EXPECTED COSTS SO THAT IT CAN BEGIN TO COMPREHENSIVELY MAKE ASSESSMENTS THE GUIDE THE LEGISLATURE TO BETTER FINANCIALLY PLAN AND PREPARE. THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE STRIDES TO DARKER HAS MADE OVER THE YEARS THE RECENT YEARS. IN ISSUING MORE COMPLETE PERMITS THAT ACCOUNT FOR TAIL AND LIABILITIES IN REQUIRING OPERATORS TO BONTA LIMITS ALLOWED BY STATE LAW AND IN ADVOCATING FOR AND ADMINISTERING STATE FUNDS TO DEAL WITH LONG TERM PROBLEMS. LIKE ABANDONED AND HAZARDOUS WELLS AS WAS SEEN IN THE LEGISLATION. THAT WE DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT IS NOW PROVIDING SOME RESOURCES TO REMEDIATE INTO CAP ABANDONED WELL SPECIFICALLY. THE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT OF THEM THAT CONTINUE TO LEGAL OIL IN MY DISTRICT. BUT THESE ARE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THEY ARE SMALL STEPS PARTICULARLY GIVEN. THE FOOT RACE WE ARE IN TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS. THE FUTURE CLEANUP COST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED OR AT LEAST ASKED TO BEAR [inaudible] SO. THE BILL MAY SEEM SMALL INTEREST SET UP THAT INITIAL -- STRUCTURE BUT IT LAYS AN IMPORTANT FOUNDATION TO DEALING RESPONSIBLY AND PROACTIVELY WITHIN INEVITABLE CHALLENGE TO OUR STATE. AS FORMER STATE LANDS COMMISSIONER GAVIN NEWSOM NOTED IN RESPONSE DEPENDING LIABILITIES TRUST IN SANTA BARBARA. HE SAID OUR EYES WERE NOT WIDE OPEN IN TERMS OF ASSESSING THE TRUE COST OF SHUTTING THESE THINGS DOWN. WHEN WE ORIGINALLY BONDED THESE LEASES AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THESE COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL? THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. SO WITH ME TODAY. I HAVE HEALTH ALFREDO DANDO WITH THOSE TOOL AND BRIAN THE WIKI WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY TO PRESENT TESTIMONY. AND I'M NOT SURE WHO HAS THE THANK YOU THANK YOU -- SENATOR AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ON FOR A LITTLE KNOWN HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF US SOON. AN ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO DEVELOPING LEVINE A LEADERSHIP AND PERSPECTIVES ON OCEAN CONSERVATION COASTAL PROTECTION COASTAL ACCESS. TO WAS VERY HAPPY TO PROVIDE STRONG SUPPORT FOR SENATOR JACKSON'S SB FIVE FIVE ONE TODAY -- SENATOR JACKSON'S ALREADY PROVIDED A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT EVENTS -- THAT HAVE LED TO THE STATE HAVING TO FOOT THE BILL OVER OVER A HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. TO THE COMMISSION PLAN FROM HOLLY IN THE WELLS AT RINCON ISLAND IN SANTA BARBARA AND VENTURA COUNTIES. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE COSTS WILL ONLY COVER THE PLUGGING INTO COMMISSIONING OF THESE WELLS AND DO NOT YET ACCOUNT FOR THE REMOVAL PLATFORM HOLLY ITSELF. WHICH HAS REFERENCE IS GOING TO COST AN ADDITIONAL TENS OF MILLIONS IN. TWO HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE -- I WAS ORIGINALLY PLANNED TO SPEND SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN INVESTED IN -- YOU KNOW WITH THAT HUNDRED MILLION -- INCLUDING THINGS LIKE CLIMATE RESILIENT -- CLIMATE SMART PROJECTS ALONG THE COAST -- BUT INSTEAD -- I I WANTED TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT I JUST SHARED WITH COMMUNITY -- WHAT WAS YOUR SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE HOPEFULLY ADDS TO THE FLAVOR THIS DISCUSSION AND I THINK IN A WAY THAT WILL LEAVE A VERY BAD TASTE IN ONE'S MOUTH -- THE BUDGET CHANGE POLLS OF THAT AND THAT'S BEFORE YOU -- AND IT'S GONNA BE DISCUSSED -- THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND SUBCOMMITTEE TO IS FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION THAT REQUEST AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION THAT WAS GOT. RECEIVED LAST YEAR -- FOR ONGOING IN ENFORCING LITIGATION COSTS RESULTING FROM MEDICAL SEE WANTING THE STATE TO PAY IT MONEY IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO SAFELY PLUG INTO COMMISSION PLATFORM HOLLY -- THERE'S ALSO A PORTION OF THE FUNDING THAT WOULD BE USED TO ATTEMPT SOME COST RECOVERY FROM THESE COMPANIES -- BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT'LL BE A PRETTY TALL ORDER -- FOR THEM TO TO SEE A PENNY COMING BACK TO THE STATE. AS A RESPONSE. TO REALLY TO PUT A FINE POINT ON THIS ALLOW ME TO PUT THIS DEVELOPING MY OWN WORDS ANOTHER COMPANY THAT HAS HAD TO FOLD WHEN THE GOING GOT TOUGH. CITED A PICK UP SOME OF ITS TOYS AND GO HOME. LEAVING SOMEONE ELSE IN THIS CASE THE STATE TO CLEAN UP AFTER THEM AT A VERY HIGH COST AND IS NOW ASKING THOSE THAT WILL DO THE CLEAN UP. TO PAY THEM FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO DO SO. AS TO BELIEVE THAT THE EVENTS SURROUNDING PLAN FROM HARLEY VERY CLEARLY ARTICULATE AND MAKE THE CASE AS TO WHY SB FIVE FIVE ONE IS NEEDED. AND WILL HELP ADDRESS SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE PROBLEMS THAT ARE JUST OCCURRING OFF SHORE BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT -- AS AS POINT ON THE ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- WILL ALSO HAPPEN ON SHORE -- WITH VERY SERIOUS FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THESE REASONS -- WE THANK SENATOR JACKSON FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND JR AYE VOTE ON SB FIVE FIVE ONE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING BRIAN A WEEK YOU WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY -- ALSO. WANNA GET OFFERED THANKS TO CENTER JACKSON FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND FOR THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR AND I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THIS -- THIS COMMITTEE HAS SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME -- INCREASING THE OVERSIGHT OF AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- AS CENTER JACKSON ALREADY LAID OUT THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS A LEGACY OF IMPACTS TO THE AIR WATER LANDSCAPING HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE LEGACY CONTINUES TO THIS DAY -- IN IN MANY CASES AS WE JUST HEARD OIL COMPANIES HAVE NOT. TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FULL COSTS OF ALL OF THAT DAMAGE LEAVING ABANDONED WELLS OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE IN ITS WAKE -- THAT CAN. CONTINUE AND I'M GOING BASIS TO POLLUTE GROUND WATER SERVICE WATER AND THE AIR -- UNDER EXISTING REQUIREMENTS A SINGLE WELL CAN BE COVERED BY A BLANKET BOND THAT APPLIES TO AN ENTIRE WELL FIELD IN THAT CASE STATE LAW WOULD REQUIRE A BOND OF TEN TO TWENTY MILLION. TO COVER FIELDS WITH HUNDREDS OF WELLS EVEN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT PERMITTED FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL WELL MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND OIL AND GAS WELLS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE THE PIPES IN AND OUT IN DIFFERENT FACILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE SO QUARTER OF A MILLION. OVER THE PAST DECADE AND A HALF DUGGAR HAS HAD TO PLUG SOME SIX HUNDRED ABANDONED WELLS AT AN AVERAGE COST OF AT LEAST THIRTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER WELL. NEITHER THE UPDATED INDIVIDUAL THEIR BLANKET FEES PROVIDE. THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN UPDATED BY DUGGAR PROVIDE EVEN HALF THE COST FOR REQUIRED TO PLUG TYPICAL WELL IN THAT IS JUST PLUGGING THE WELL NOT REMOVING INFRASTRUCTURE AND REMEDIATING THE SITE. SB FIVE FIVE ONE WOULD REQUIRE DUGGAR TO DEVELOP A MECHANISM FOR ASSESSING THE FULL COST OF DECOMMISSIONING AND REMOVING INFRASTRUCTURE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THE LOCATION OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS THAT MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFIC COST ESTIMATES THERE IS GREAT NEED. IN OUR OPINION FOR STRONGER OVERSIGHT GUIDANCE IN PLANNING AND WELL REMEDIATION BUT THE BARE MINIMUM MUST BE TO MAKE SURE THAT COSTS. OF REMOVAL AND REMEDIATION ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THE STATE AHEAD OF TIME SB FIVE FIVE ONE IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP TOWARD PROTECTING AGAINST IN RECOVERING FROM THE DAMAGES OF OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND ASKS YOU TO DO SO AS WELL. THANK YOU. ONE OF THE MADE ON A WITHOUT A ONE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT [inaudible] YEAH. WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. BRENNAN DAWSON WAS HERE CUT CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OKAY. WE HAVE A FULL TIME POSITION TO THE BILL. I WANT TO COME UP HERE AND PRESENT. THE MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- ANTHONY THOMAS. CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. IN OPPOSITION TO SB. FIVE FIVE ONE MEMBERS -- THE GOALS OF THE BILL HAVE BEEN STATED FOR THE MOST PART BUT IF I CAN TAKE YOU TO SECTION. ONE OF LINE THREE EIGHT INCLUDES. A PLAN FOR DOGGETT MUST DEVELOP A MECHANISM THE TERM MECHANISM HAS BEEN USED. THIS MORNING TO ASSESS THE FOOLED. CASA DE COMMISSIONING CLEAN OF REMEDIATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED TO THE INDUSTRY -- EXCEPT TRUTH HOWEVER THE BILL LOOK FAILS TO SPELL OUT WHAT THE MECHANISM WILL BE. THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE AND I WILL GET BACK TO THAT IN A SECOND. IT FAILS TO SPELL OUT WHAT THE MECHANISM WILL BE. I'M SAYING THAT MY MEMBERS DO POLLS BONDS CURRENTLY FOR THINGS SUCH A SPILL CLEAN UP. CITY FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS IDA WELLS ANOTHER REQUIREMENTS BONDING FOR THIS FOR FOR MEDIATION IS ESTIMATED BY DOGGER. IS LIKELY IN A REALISTIC ALSO A PESSIMISTIC STANCE. IT ALSO OCCURS THE INDUSTRY THAT SOME LOCAL AGENCIES DO SEEK TO RETIRE FOR PRODUCTION THROUGH AMBER'S A TATIAN. THEY DEEM EXISTING OPERATIONS AS NON LEGAL CONFORMING THE CLEAR OF VALUE TO THE NON CONFORMING ELEMENTS THEN LIMIT THE MUNICIPALITIES LIABILITY. TO THE DECLARED VALUE. THE BILL READS LIKE A PRECURSOR TO LIMITING LOCAL LIABILITY AGENCIES AGENCIES LOCAL LIABILITY. GOOD FOR BILL ON ORDINANCE WERE ADOPTED THEN LATER CHALLENGED BY THE INDUSTRY COURTS COULD COURTS COULD POINT TO DOGS ESTIMATED. ESTIMATED DECOMMISSIONING COSTS AS ONE DATA POINT UPON WHICH TO LIMIT THOSE DAMAGES. THE BILL WE SEE IS ROCKED WITH POTENTIAL PROBLEMS HOW WILL THEY ARRIVE AT THE FULL COSTS WILL LAY ARRIVED AT THE FULL WHEN WHEN THEY ARRIVE AT THE COLORFUL COSTS. HOW DO YOU READ OR DRESS ITEMS AT IS DATA SERVICE ON WE WANT TO KEEP IT ROLLED PAT STORAGE AREAS OR WELLS? WHAT IS MEANT BY REMEDIATION AGAIN THERE'S NO DEFINITION HERE IN THE BILL? WHAT ABOUT DUPLICATION OF FEDERAL LEASES? WHO AT DOG HAS THE ABILITY OR THE KNOWLEDGE TO IDENTIFY COST TO REMEDIATE WE COULD GO ON -- BUT THE BILL LOOKS LIKE IT'S ANOTHER SEATING OF AUTHORITY TO AN APPOINTED BODY WHOSE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE VOTING PUBLIC. IS NONEXISTENT FOR POLICY ACCESS. THIS PATH OVER TIME DOES THE MINISTER CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY OF AN ELECTED BODY. AS I CLOSE IF THE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS STATES THAT THE BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. THAT'S WHAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SAYS IN A MAKE SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE THE BILL WORKABLE. IF A BILL IS A WORK IN PROGRESS MEMBERS IT SHOULD NOT PASSED OUT OF ANY POLICY COMMITTEE FOR THAT STATED REASON ALONE A WORK. IN PROGRESS WHEN THE BILL IS NOT READY IT'S AN INCENTIVE FOR BOTH PROPONENTS ANY OPPOSITION TO WORK ON IT TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE POLICY COMMITTEE ITSELF. OTHERWISE THE PROPONENTS HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS DUE TO NO ONE AT THE BILL WILL MOVE IN ANY WAY. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SB FIVE FIVE ONE IS NOT READY AND SHOULD BE HELD IN COMMITTEE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT IS FIT TO MOVE. WE WOULD OR TO KNOW. FOR MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HEALY GARCIA FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION. ALSO IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. WE SHARE A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM -- FROM SUPER. CLEARLY THE BILL I A WORK IN PROGRESS WE SHARE THE CONCERNS OF RAISING THE ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF THE A LACK OF DEFINITION -- FOR MECHANISMS -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WHAT WE ARE. DEVELOPING IS POTENTIALLY A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO PROVIDING -- SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL ASSURANCES AND THAT MAY BE A PROBLEM -- IT WILL BE PROBLEMATIC IF WE ARE NOT CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN. THIS MECHANISM -- AND EXISTING FINANCIAL SERVICE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IN PLACE IMPOSE SOMETIMES BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SITE SPECIFIC. PROJECT SPECIFIC AND IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTION -- FINANCIAL ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS OUR MEMBERS MAINTAIN THEIR OWN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- THAT THEY MAINTAIN -- WHETHER THEY BE FUNDING LETTERS OF CREDIT -- GUARANTEES AND THEY ALSO THAT DISTILLING IMPOSE SOME OF THOSE FINANCIAL ASSURANCES AS PART OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS WHEN THEY CELL PRODUCTION ASSETS. TO A SUBSEQUENT PARTY. SO THERE'S A LOT -- THAT. NEEDS TO BE WORKED THROUGH. WHAT IS THIS MECHANISM AS IDENTIFIED IN THIS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS LOTS OF QUESTIONS HERE? BUT ALSO. WE HOPE SOME. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE EXISTING FINANCIAL ASSURANCES -- BOTH HELD BY THE STATE AND IN PRIVATE HANDS -- SOME OF THE THE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED AND FLESHED OUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- AS A COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES NOTES THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF ADDITIONS TO THE REQUIREMENTS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE WISSMANN MEMBERS OF WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH. THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH REGULATORS -- TO ENHANCE. SO AGAIN AT THIS POINT WE WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL IT IS FAR FROM BEING FLUSHED OUT. WE UNDERSTAND -- I THINK THE THE ISSUES THAT SENATOR JACKSON'S TRYING TO ADDRESS. WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- THE STATE BUDGET HAD TO JUMP IN LAST YEAR. AND THEN AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE SET OF FACTS BUT SOMETIMES BAD FAX. CAN LEAD US TO MAKE BAD LAW WHICH ONE BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE RESPOND. TO A NARROW SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES -- THE PANIC OF SITUATION AND OTHERS -- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE EXISTING FINANCIAL CHURCHES ARE IN PLACE -- IMPOSED BY STATE LOCAL AND BY OPERATORS. SO AGAIN AT THIS TIME WE WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- OTHER FOLKS WHO WANT TO RAISE OPPOSITION OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. OKAY THE MEASURE FOR THE COMMITTEE I WILL SAY ON HIM MY MY GOOD FRIEND ANTHONY. IF IF THE LEGISLATURE. REFUSED TO PASS BILLS OUT OF COMMITTEE THAT WERE WORKS IN PROGRESS -- WE PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT A TEN TO THE BILL'S MAKE THEIR WAY OUT OF COMMITTEE -- SO MAYBE THAT BIG THING WHO KNOWS BUT I'M. YEAH BUT EVEN AROUND THE BILL HE WANTED US TO KNOW THAT A WORK IN PROGRESS IS NOT A FACTORY WORKER IS NOT A SCENE IS A AS A REASON NOT TO TO PASSA BILL OUT BUT I I GET I GET THE CONCERNS THAT. AXING SENATOR THE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I HAVE BEEN AROUND AWHILE AND AND AND IF I COULD JUST GO BACK TO THE YEARS OF A GENTLEMAN NAMED JOHN VSCONCELOS. AND I WILL MAKE THIS VERY QUICK I WAS HE WAS THE CHAIR OF WHAT IS CALLED THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE WHICH IS NOT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. SOUL MR VASCONCELOS WAS CHAIRING HIS COMMITTEE ONE OF HIS CAUCUS MEMBERS CAME IN AND SAID. MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAVE A BILL THAT IS NOT QUITE READY HE CUT THE MEMBER OFTEN SAID YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS TO LEAVE THE BUILDING COMMITTEE OR TO TAKE IT WITH YOU. MY POINT IS WHEN YOU PASS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. FROM THIS POLICY COMMITTEE THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT IS NOT READY IT TOOK HIM TO SENDING A CHILD TO SCHOOL WITH THE SMALL COAL. HERE SHE IS NOT READY THE BILL IS NOT READY ANY POLICY ENVIRONMENT SENATOR THAT'S ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT IN DISCUSS CAN WORK ON A POLICY ISSUE. YOU DON'T SEND IT THROUGH AGAIN IT DISINCENTIVE VICES. THE AUTHOR FOR THE PROPONENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS NOW IT MAY BE THAT WAY NOW BUT IF YOU IF TIMELINE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. I WOULD LEAN ON THAT PERSPECTIVE ONE GOOD POLICY I I I I I DON'T I MEAN I I A YES SIR I DON'T HAVE AN INTERN WITH ME BUT I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE TWO OF YOU IT MAY BE OF SUPPORTING THE BILL ONCE. IN THE PAST IT WASN'T IT WASN'T FULLY COOKED -- AT ANOTHER COMMITTEE ABOUT IT BUT I I NEVER HAPPENED BY THE WAY ALRIGHT I FIVE YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I I I I I I GET YOUR POINT I WILL SAY THAT YOU KNOW -- IT IS INTERESTING. YOU KNOW I'M HERE WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT THAT YOU KNOW I THINK HAS A VERY IF ANYTHING DEPARTMENTS OFTENTIMES CRITICIZED FOR BEING. TOO CLOSE TO THE INDUSTRY -- I MEAN YOU EAT. BUT I I DID THESE ARE FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND AND GET THE WORK DO YOU DO AND I DON'T I I MEAN I I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY BE CONCERNED ABOUT VARIOUS. ASPECTS OF THE BILL BECAUSE IT'S IT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT BUT IT'S PRECISELY UP AT A DEPARTMENT LIKE THIS THAT IS SO WELL INFORMED AND UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS UNDERSTANDS. THE OIL EXTRACTION BUSINESS -- THAT YOU WANT THEM TO BE MAKING THESE KINDS OF ASSESSMENTS AS OPPOSED TO THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS YEAH A BUNCH OF FOLKS WORKING WITH THEIR YOU KNOW THEIR HEADS CUT OFF TRYING TO WORK ON A HUNDRED DIFFERENT ISSUE AREAS IT EVERY DAY. SO -- YOU KNOW THAT IS PRECISELY WHY WE HAVE. DEPARTMENTS LIKE DOCTOR OUT THERE -- TO YOU KNOW TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THE KNOWLEDGE -- TO TO IT TO HIM OF THESE KINDS OF THINGS THAT'S WHY I'M I'M IN A PARTIAL TO TO THE TO THE BILL BUT I UNDERSTAND IT'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE AUTHOR WANTS TO MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS. YES THE THAT THERE CERTAINLY IS WORK TO BE DONE I KNOW THE OPPOSITION CAME IN AND TENS JUST BEFORE WE WENT ON OUR BREAK THE BILL'S BEEN IN PRINT SINCE FEBRUARY SO -- CLEARLY THERE IS -- AND AND AS WAS POINTED OUT MOST BILLS WE THEY ARE WORKS IN PROGRESS -- THERE'S A TACTICS SOMETIMES OPPOSITION USES WHICH IS THE DELAY IN HOPE THAT A BILL CAN'T GET OUT OF COMMITTEE AND THEN IT'S DEAD FOR THE YEAR SO. MOVING THE BILL WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE. IN THE PROCESS WE GOT SOME GOOD SUGGESTIONS AND OBSERVATIONS IN THE ANALYSIS WE ARE. CONTINUING TO WORK WITH DR -- AND TO DEVELOP A SPECIFIC PROGRAM ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS THERE IS A CURRENTLY A PROGRAM CALLED CAMP T.. I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE ACRONYM IS BUT IT BASICALLY ALLOWS FOR THE ASSESSMENT. OF MINES ABANDONED MINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT MIGHT BE. AN APPROACH METHODOLOGY THAT WILL WANT TO USE HERE -- AND AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT -- I THINK HAS SOME MERIT TO IT AND IS THE BILL PROCEEDS I THINK BASICALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THIS BILL. ARE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN I HEAR THAT THE? INDUSTRY THE ORAL INDUSTRY SAYS THAT THEY OF THEY HAVE MADE FINANCIAL ASSURANCES. CLEARLY THE FACT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY HAD TO PUT DOWN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND HAS BEEN ASKED TO PUT DOWN FOR MILLION MORE. FOR LITIGATION -- BECAUSE THE COMPANIES SAID OF ABANDONED THESE WELLS WANT THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO PAY. TO MAINTAIN THEM WHILE THEY ARE BEING DE. I'M I FIND IT ACTUALLY KIND OF AN OUTRAGE TO THE STATE THAT WOULD THAT THOSE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE HAVING TO PAY. THE OIL INDUSTRY EXPENSES AFTER THEY HAVE. TAKEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PROFIT INTERESTS LITERALLY WALKED AWAY IT'S LIKE THE CHILD WHO. DOESN'T WANT TO CLEAN UP THE ROOM AND SAYS YOU DO IT FOR ME. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE SO THE PRINCIPLE I BELIEVE IS AN APPROPRIATE -- ONE WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH IT -- THIS ISSUE WE HAVE HAD LEGISLATION I WOULD LIKE. TO WE KNOW THAT THE CENTER HERTZBERG IS DONE WITH SOME LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE BONDING COSTS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE EXPANSIONS OF OIL DRILLING BUT THAT ISN'T ENOUGH THAT ISN'T GOING. TO COVER THE COSTS OF DECOMMISSIONING IT'S A MAINTAINING THEM SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL -- TRIES TO SET UP THAT METHODOLOGY SO THE GOING FORWARD PERHAPS THE STATE CAN RECOUP SOME OF THOSE COSTS RATHER THAN. HAVE THE OIL INDUSTRY CONTINUE JUST TO WALK AWAY AND LEAVE THE THE TAX PAYERS CALIFORNIA HOLDING THE BACK HE SAID I WILL PUT IT IS THIS IS THIS IS YOUR FIRST COMMITTEE RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT. STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AND A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOR EVERYONE AWAY AND CENTER HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON WIENER STAND IS HOW ALL THIS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. SOLVES THIS PET PLATFORM HOLLY PROBLEMA AB. APOLOGIES AND FOCUS OF ATTENTION EARLIER BUT WHEN I WAS HERE THIS COMMITTEE WE HAD THE HORRIBLE SITUATION PLATFORM HOLLY. AND WHAT WE LEARN WE LEARN THE COMPANY FILED BANKRUPTCY UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAWS NO MATTER HOW OLD THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE. THERE WERE STOCK FOR STOCK RIGHT BECAUSE IF THEY POLLUTE THE ENVIRONMENT SOMEBODY GOES BANKRUPT THERE'S NO WAY TO GO UP THE LIABILITY CHAIN WERE IN TROUBLE. SO THE NEXT YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE VARIOUS MEETINGS THAT WE HAD WE CREATED A PROCESS TO CREATE AN ASSESSMENT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE BOND BECAUSE WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THE BIG WEALTHY OIL COMPANIES WERE SELLING OFF THESE. THESE FACILITIES WHEN THEY'RE ON THE TAIL END THE COMPANY'S A DIDN'T HAVE SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEETS SIGNIFICANT THOSE COMPANIES WOULD GRAB WITH THE GRAB FILE BE QUE. AND WE WERE LEFT EXPOSED HENCE WHY WERE IN THE SITUATION FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PLUS MILLION DOLLARS AND PLATFORM ALI. AND HENCE WHY WE DID LEGISLATION WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO TO DEAL WITH THAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE THE FINANCIAL RISK. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW HAVING A PLAN DOES ANYTHING BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS WHEN YOU SEE THE TAXPAYERS ARE GONNA GET HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEY'RE GONNA GET ACCOUNT IS GOING TO HELL LIKE WE'RE SEEING IN THAT THEIR BANKRUPTCIES WITH OTHER. PUBLICLY RELATED ENTITIES HOW TO HAVING A PLAN WHAT YOU NEED IS MORE COVERAGE MORE PROTECTION LESS THOUGHT MORE THORNY IT SEEMS TO ME TO MAKE SURE THAT BEFORE YOU APPROVE A TRANSFER. YOU MAKE SURE SOMEBODY HAS A BALANCE SHEET THAT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM YOU CAN PAY FOR IT RIGHT AND WHO CARES IF A IF A BOND IS TEN X. OVER ABOVE WITH THE ACTUAL LIABILITY IS. SPENDING MONEY TO DO THIS SEEMS TO ME -- THE IDEA IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE TWENTY SEVEN WELLS IS NO QUESTION THAT WE SOUGHT HAPPENED WE BOTH WERE INVOLVED WITH IT. BUT I'M TRYING TO GET TO HOW HAVING ANOTHER STUDY IN ANOTHER ASSESSMENT GETS THIS I'D RATHER HAVE AN APPROVAL PROCESS BEFORE WE ALLOWED THESE PHONY TRANSFERS TO HAVE. THAT WE MADE SURE WHOEVER THE NEW ENTITY WAS HAD SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESERVES AND OR BOTH BE INSURANCE OR BONDS OR WHATEVER THAT. THEY GET A CLEAN UP TO THE STANDARDS THAT THE BIG STORY FOR QUITE A I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO HIT THAT ONE IT IS LIKE THAT -- BUT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER BILL THAT'S ANOTHER BILL WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS BE ABLE TO ASSESS. THE VARIOUS ON SHORE AS WELL AS OFFSHORE WELLS ARE OUT THERE -- TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE FULL SCOPE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY ARE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION THIRD THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NOTION THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO START SEEING TRANSFERS OR FOR GOING TO SEE EXPANSION. OF OIL DRILLING THAT WE TRY. TO ANTICIPATE POTENTIAL FUTURE LIABILITY SO THAT WE CAN EITHER REQUIRE ADDITIONAL BONDING OR WE CAN TAKE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW -- THE BONDING DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS ALL THE ASPECTS WHEN THEY'RE DE COMMISSIONED. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DATA IN THIS SET UP THAT METHODOLOGY SO THAT AT LEAST WE HAVE THE INFORMATION THEY WILL BE FOLLOWING TO A STEP SUBSEQUENT TO THAT I HOPE. THAT WILL BE TAKEN BUT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ARE AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE I'D LIKE TO SEE. WHEN THE NOTION THAT WE'RE STUCK WITH PLATFORM HOLLY AND THAT THE STATE IS PAYING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS? BECAUSE THE COMPANY THAT NOW ON TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY IN THE BONDING WASN'T LARGE ENOUGH IS IT CHOSE CORALS. THE HAIR ON MY BACK I CHOSE STUFF. I I JUST FIND IT SO OFFENSIVE -- BUT THAT IS AS YOU SAY THEY'VE DECLARE BANKRUPTCY BUT GOING FORWARD PERHAPS WE CAN BE BETTER PREPARED THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IT'S ONE OF THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN HERTZBERG. FOR THE THOUGHTS OKAY I OKAY I JUST HAVE YES CENTER WEST OF THIS GENERALLY -- WE'VE GOT A HAVE YOU KNOW. WE'VE WE'VE ADDRESSED -- CONTAMINATION IN OUR STATE THROUGH FEDERAL SUPERFUND SITES WHERE REGARDLESS OF WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY CURRENTLY THAT YOU COULD GO BACK AND TITLE? AND INVESTIGATE WHO USED TO BE THE OWNER AND WHO ACTUALLY BECAUSE THE CONTAMINATION AND ACTUALLY. TAKE SPECIFICALLY GALACTION GOING TO CONSERVE PEOPLE MY SUSPICION IS THAT IN AND IN THE CASE OF OF HOLLY. THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNERS SOLD MADE A TON OF MONEY. SOLD TO A SHELL CORPORATION THAT DIDN'T HAVE ASSETS [inaudible] AND WHAT THE WHAT THE SIMPLE -- A STRATEGY TO BASICALLY. REMOVE THEMSELVES OF A LIABILITY. AND OF A RESPONSIBILITY. SO CAN WE USE THE SUPERFUND MECHANISM TO KIND OF SU. THE OWNERS OF THE PREVIOUS OWNERS OF HOLLY AND HAVE THEM CLEAN IT UP WELL THAT'S SOMETHING IS WE LOOK IN A SENSE WHAT THE COSTS ARE IS IT THE PROBABLY A GOOD QUESTION UNFORTUNATELY IS / KNOW -- THE SUPER FUND -- SYSTEM IS NOT BEING FUNDED BY THE FED SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE SUPERFUND SITES CONTINUING. TO MAINTAIN THE LEVELS OF TOXICITY IN DANGER TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. THAT -- THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT'S A THE SUBSET OF LAWS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SEEK DAMAGES YES. YES AND AND I YOU KNOW I I SUPPORT THIS WORK AND I JUST THINK THAT THE THE INDUSTRY'S BRINGING THIS UPON THEMSELVES. BUT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO TRY OUR STATE AND AND I I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE COMMENTS OF OF CENTER HERTZBERG AND AND HOW HE CHARACTERIZED THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU. TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS ON HOW WE CAN -- PURSUE THIS INCLUDING. OPENING UP THE ABILITY TO GO AFTER PREVIOUS OWNERS. WELL I KNOW HAT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING AND THAT IN FACT THE ORIGINAL OWNER DID HAVE A A BOND THE RICH ALONE I BELIEVE THIS ONE OF THE LARGE. OIL COMPANIES AND AS YOU SAID THEY KEEP SELLING THEM DOWN THE ROAD FOR SOMEWHERE IN THERE SOMEBODY MADE AN ENORMOUS PROFIT -- YOU CAN BE SURE THAT CAN BE THROUGH A KIND OF AN EVENT ENTRY PROCESS THE PROBLEM IS SAID THE CURRENT OWNER IT IS -- DECLARED BANKRUPTCY THE PRIOR OWNER THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT THE BONDING WHICH WAS DONE PROBABLY FORTY YEARS AGO WAS WHOLLY INADEQUATE TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT TODAY -- AND I'M SURE THERE'S LITIGATION GOING. ON THAT ISSUE BUT THIS IS ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX AS WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YES THIS INDUSTRY IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO TAKE. RESPONSIBILITY WHETHER ENVIRONMENTALLY OR FINANCIALLY I SEE THE TEARS ON HERE BUT I I DON'T KNOW THE STATE OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE -- BUT SEEING THAT IT IT IS A MENTALLY WORK IN PROGRESS I CAN HEAR YOU. COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ABSOLUTELY TO MAKE SURE WE FLUSH OUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT AND RAISED AND YOU KNOW I KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOU NEVER GONNA COME TO A COMBINED A MOMENT WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT COULD YOU GIVE US YOUR READ ON THE STATE OF PLAY WITH. NEGOTIATIONS AND AND YOUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE MOVING FORWARD ON THE STRETCHER WELL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL -- IT'S IT IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD IDENTIFY. WHERE THE THE THE MONEY? HAS GONE IN BE ABLE TO CLOCK BACK ON BEHALF OF THE TAXPAYERS A CALIFORNIA. BUT WE RIGHT NOW THIS IS A MEASURE THAT IS JUST TRYING TO LOOK AT ALL THE BIGGER PICTURE I THERE WAS MENTION THEIR TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND WELLS. THIS OIL AND GAS WELLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AND I THINK THIS THIS IS A MEASURE WHERE WERE TRUST TRYING. TO IDENTIFY. WHAT THE -- WHAT THE POTENTIAL COSTS ARE YOU IN IN FACT I AM VERY INTERESTED IN THE CAMP T. -- MODEL WHICH IS USED NOW FOR ABANDONED MINES I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD VERY POSSIBLY ADOPT. OR ADAPT TO THE SITUATION WITH THE OIL AND GAS AND I'M VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT THAT BUT THE CONFINES OF FOUR CORNERS OF THE BILL ARE BASICALLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND I'M VERY VERY HAPPY. TO CONTINUE WORKING THE STAFF THE STAFF AND MYSELF AS WELL -- TO TO WITH THE CHAIR AND IN OTHERS TO TO COME UP WITH A A WAY TO DO THIS IN AN ACCURATE AND EFFECTIVE FASHION. ON THAT WILL BE MY CLOTHES AND OKAY THANK YOU SO AND I KNOW THE STAFF IS FAIR AND I I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA ALSO WANT TO TAKE SERIOUSLY THAT SOME THE CONCERNS THE OPPOSITION -- WHILE HELPING THE AUTHOR I GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WE CAN ADDRESS THE THE BIG CONCERNS THAT ARE THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE SPACE SO -- WITH THAT WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- SO MOVES SO MOVED IN AND THAT'S YOUR CLOTHES -- THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE FOR PARTICIPATING CENTERPIECE COLOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SENATORS STERN JONES ALLEN HI ALLEN AYE FORGES CABALLERO HERTZBERG.

WITH -- WITH WITH HEAT. AND WITH RADIO FORCING OUT WE'RE HAPPY TO GET INTO MORE DETAIL IF YOU LIKE BUT IT'S A IT'S AN IMPORTANT NEW TOOL TO GIVE THE AIR -- AND VERY MUCH HOPE THAT YOU'LL I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. WHEN WITH ME I HAVE JOE CASE IN THE CONSERVATION [inaudible] RAINY. AT THE INTERNATIONAL IN THE BY. SIR JOH CAVES CONSERVATION STRATEGY GROUP THIS IS A SMALL VERY TECHNICAL BUT VERY IMPORTANT BILL IT'LL HELP BRING. CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE PROGRAM INTO ALIGNMENT WITH THE LATEST GLOBAL CLIMATE SCIENCE. IT'LL HELP GUIDE OUR PARTICULAR SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS PROGRAM AND THE PROVIDE SOME TOOLS SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEALING WITH THE HEAT BUILD UP. AND RADIATIVE FORCING THAT'S CURRENTLY OCCURRING -- IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE REST THE QUOTE WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CASE. IS THIS GOING YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE ON AUTOMATICALLY ON A THANK YOU GOOD MORNING FIRST OF ALL AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK BEFORE THIS DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR ALLEN FOR AUTHORING THIS LEGISLATION AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR. FOR HIS SUPPORT AND CO AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. MY NAM IS TODD DELANEY I CHAIR. THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE COORDINATING COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED BY AYSO. AYSO IS THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARD ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION AT A GENEVA SWITZERLAND. WE PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON CLIMATE RELATED STANDARDS. AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT AN INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS SUPPORT A ROBUST AND OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. DESPITE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO DATE CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE. CALIFORNIA OFFERING OWN SHARE OF CON CLIMATE RELATED IMPACT BROKE DROUGHT FLOODS MUD SLIDES IN FIRES. WHICH HAVE IMPACTED MANY OF YOUR DISTRICTS. BUT THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE A CRITICAL NEXT STEP IS THE ADOPTION OF A RADIATIVE FORCING. BASED CLIMATE PROTOCOL TO COMPLEMENT CURRENT CLIMATE ACCOUNTING EFFORTS. HI SO RELIES ON THE IPCC. REPORTS IS NORMATIVE REFERENCES TO ENSURE THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ARE BASED ON THE MOST UP TO DATE SCIENCE. I AM CONVENING THE ICE -- EFFORT TO STANDARDIZE THE RADIATIVE FORCING ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL. DERIVED FROM THE I. P. C.'S FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT. THIS IS SIMILAR TO HOW DO YOU W. P.. ONE HUNDRED ACCOUNTING PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE I PC SECOND ASSESSMENT REPORT IN THE MID NINETIES. THE PROTOCOL HAS ALREADY BEEN REVIEWED BY LEADING U. S. CLIMATE SCIENTISTS. AND CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR COALITION SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY PANEL IS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL REVIEW. ADOPTING A RADIATIVE FORCING BASED PROTOCOL THROUGH SB SIX EIGHTY TWO WILL REINFORCE CALIFORNIA'S POSITION AS AN INTERNATIONAL LEADER. ON CLIMATE CHANGE. SETTING THE STAGE TO HELP THE WORD OF THE WORLD AVOID OVERSHOOTING GLOBAL. TYRANT TEMPERATURE TARGETS THIS PROTOCOL BRINGS GREATER TRANSPARENCY TO THE FACTORS IN INFLUENCING OUR CLIENT. IMPROVE METRICS IN NEW INSIGHTS TO PRIORITIZE MITIGATION ACTIONS THAT MOST EFFICIENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY COULD STABILIZE CLIMATE. ESPECIALLY BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY THE WORLD IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME. HI SO FOR SIX EIGHTY TWO PASSED INTO LAW THIS YEAR. IT WILL ALLOW CARB TO EVALUATE AND IMPLEMENT THE PROTOCOL WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THIS WOULD REINFORCE THE ADOPTION OF THIS PROTOCOL BY OTHER COUNTRIES. WHO ARE LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA'S EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP FOR GUIDANCE? KNOWING HOW LONG IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY AGENCY REGULATORY CHANGE CAN TAKE I BELIEVE SB SIX EIGHTY TWO COULD SPEED UP GLOBAL ADOPTION. BY AS MUCH AS FIVE YEARS. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TIMING COULD NOT BE OVERSTATED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I HEARD YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT NOW OR AT ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE THANK. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IN NONE OF ANY OPPOSITION. BEING NINE BRING BACK TO THE DíAS COMMENTS QUESTIONS ENTERTAIN. PARDON ME A MOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THE MOTION FOR CENTER MINING. YOU KNOW I'M ALREADY ON BOARD -- SORT OF GET THROUGH THAT DIVIDE BETWEEN. THE SHORT LIVED POLLUTANTS ZACHARY. ALL THE METRICS IN THE SYSTEM. I I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE THE POINT ABOUT ADVANCING SCIENCE IN A MORE XCELERATED MANNERS WELL IN IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE WE HAVE NO TIME TO WAIT. YEAH. THANKSGIVING IS FOR CENTER ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AN EXTRAORDINARY AT VERY DISTINGUISHED GROUP OF SCIENTISTS WHO ARE ABOARD THIS AND WORKING WITH US I JUST WANT TO GIVE THEM MY PERSONAL THINGS AND APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT YOU'RE IN THE COMMITTEE AND RESPECT FAST FROM HAVE A VERY GOOD.

FOR WHICH WOULD HELP ENSURE ON NATIONAL FAIRNESS. CALIFORNIA'S WATER RIGHT HOLDERS OF PROTECTING THEM FROM THEIR FINANCE ARM IN THE FORM OF THE THE LAST YEAR WHILE IN IS. I WAS IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AUTHORED AB. SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH SOUGHT TO RESTORE DUE PROCESS AN OBJECT THE CALIFORNIA WATER RIGHT. THE BILL CREATED IN ADMINISTRATIVE. ADMINISTRATIVE DURING OFFICE UNDER THE STATE WATER BOARD IN NEUTRAL FORUM TO ADJUDICATE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT COMPLEX MODERATE MATTER. ONLY BE A REPRESENTATIVE SURE DOES THAT WATER RIGHT THE HERE'S WHAT ONLY PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR THE NEW OFFICE. WHICH WOULD BE FUNDED. BY WATER RIGHT HOLDERS. NEW CANNABIS BLIGHT. AND THE GENERAL FUND. HOWEVER THE RECENTLY ADMITTED BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL CAME IN NEARLY 30% HIGHER THAN THE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENS CURRENT REPAIR. THIS HAS REAL CONSEQUENCE. CALIFORNIA WATER PROVIDER. THE NEW HEARINGS OFFICE MAYBE SUPPORTED BY THE GENERAL FUND AND THE WATER RIGHT. THAT'S PROBLEMATIC AS THE WATER RIGHT FIND IT. EARLY BY FEES. AND WATER RIGHT HOLDERS. THESE WHICH ARE ARE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RISE HOUSING. FINANCE. NO MORE INCREASES ARE NOT. NOT ONLY THAT AS THE LAWS. CURRENTLY. PARTY'S UTILIZING THE HEARING OFFICE MAY NOT BE THE FINANCE BELIEVE. OFFICE AND BY. SB FOUR BY OR READ DOORS BALLOT. THE BILL ENSURES THAT THE NEW HEARING OFFICE WILL REACH IF THE NECESSARY FUNDS. MANDATED DUTIES. WITHOUT UNFAIRLY IMPACTING WATER RIGHT HOLDERS READING A NEW WATER RIGHT. OFF FIND THAT WOULD BE USED -- SIMPLY. HEARING OFFICE. ONE WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY THE FILING FEES AND FINES IMPOSED BY THE OFFICE. WHICH MUST BE USED DIRECT. DIRECTLY REDUCE THE HEARING OFFICE. OFFICES PINEAPPLE DEPENDENT ON THE WATER RIGHT. WHILE YOU ARE IDENTICAL THAT THOSE IMPOSED. ENSURING PARTIES UTILIZED IN THE OFFICE PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SUPPORT WITHOUT BEING. PARTIES TO UTILIZE THE HEARING OFFICE. AND ARE FOUND IN VIOLATION A LOT AND FIND OLDER A LARGER PORTION FINANCE. IN A THIS STRUCTURE -- MECHANISM SELECT AND AND IF THE MACINNES. MECHANISM THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY. WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. THE BELL IS. HIS. RECORD YOUR MORE FROM BYRON BETHANY. AND I DON'T HAVE ANY YES MY OF THE FACT THAT THE HELLO WHAT WE WERE. MENTAL [inaudible] ONE THE I'M I'M A MEMBER NUMBER ZERO ON OUR PREVIOUS BILL. WE'VE ANY OTHERS IN FORT. BEING NINE WITH ANY IN OPPOSITION. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WBG I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE US BEFORE FIFTY FOUR WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO INSURE THAT PROCESS CANNABIS GROWERS DO NOT PAY INTO THE WATER RATES FUND. UP UNDER THIS HEARING OFFICE. BUT THE WAY THAT THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED IN COMMITTEE AND AS INITIALLY DRAFTED. WOULD IMPOSE FEES ON EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATES IN ONE OF THESE WATER RIGHTS PROCEEDING. ACCORDING TO THE BOARDS REGULATIONS. IN TITLE. TWENTY THREE PARTIES ARE DEFINED VERY BROADLY TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO FILE A PROTEST OF WATER RIGHT. WHICH COULD INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. IT INCLUDES. FISHING GROUPS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS LIKE OURSELVES. AND THUS SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR IS CREATING A BARRIER FOR THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE HEARINGS THAT DOES NOT EXIST TODAY. AND IS MAKING IT HARDER FOR US TO ENFORCE AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC INTEREST. YOU KNOW E HAD SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRIOR BILL THE SET UP THIS ADMINISTRATING THE MEASURE OF HEARING OFFICE WE FELT IT WAS UNNECESSARY. THE SUPREME COURT HAD UP HELD THE BOARD HEARING PROCESSES AS COMPLYING WITH DUE PROCESS. BUT WE WENT ALONG AND WE ACCEPTED THAT. THIS HEARING ADMISSION HEARING OFFICE WOULD GO FORWARD. NOW HOWEVER WERE IMPOSING FEES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S RIGHTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE. TO OPPOSE THE BILL AND VOTE NO TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND ALSO SEE A COUPLE CALIFORNIA WE WOULD LIKE TO A LINER. SB WE JUST BELIEVE THIS IS A CRIMINAL TO SOME OF THE PUBLIC AND OTHER GROUPS THAT WOULD BE BRINGING WATER RIGHTS ISSUES BEFORE THE BOARD THANK YOU. GOOD THANK YOU AND IS IN OPPOSITION. OKAY WILL BRING IT BACK MEMBER. YEAH JUST THE TWO OF US IS A SONG ABOUT THAT. CAN I JUMP IN -- COMMENTS EIGHTY FEET. REACTIONS TO SOME OF THAT OPPOSITION CONCERNS ABOUT I MEAN IS YOUR INTENT TO COVER PULIC AGENCIES AND NON PROFITS IN WHEN IT WHEN IT SAYS ANY PARTY. YOU'RE GOING TO GET A SENSE YOUR TO REACT [inaudible] SO [inaudible] THERE ARE. WAIVERS. INCLUDING PUBLIC AID THE AND FEE WAIVERS FOR PARTIES WHO CANNOT AFFORD -- TO PAY THOSE FILING FEES. AND SO THE THE FILING FEE IS CURLY STATE ARE TIED TO THE FEES FOR SACRAMENTO. COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. I IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ADD SOME CLARIFICATIONS IN THERE. TOO PRESS OR TO INCORPORATE THE SAME WAY BIRTH THAT EXIST IN -- THE LAWS THAT APPLY TO SUPERIOR COURT AND YOU SAID A IS BASED ON ABILITY THAT YOU CAN AFFORD IT. IT BASED ON A FORTY IF YOU FILE IN SUPERIOR COURT NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO PAY A FEE AND THE FEES THAT WE PROPOSED HERE ARE WOULD BE TIED EXACTLY TO THIS. COURT FEES. IN SUPERIOR COURT IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD. THAT AND THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS FOR THIS ALSO -- YOU CAN HAVE THOSE FEES WAIVED. THERE IS THERE A FEE WAIVER PROVISIONS IN THE LAW. BUT UNLESS YOU QUALIFY FOR THE FEW A PROVISIONS IN THEORY THIS BILL WOULD STILL REQUIRE THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY A FEE AND NONPROFIT TO PAY A FEE -- THE MAFIA FEE. FOR THEY'RE NOT ANY PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE NOT THE STATE NOT DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE NOT BE W. R. K. I'M NOT ANY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCY OF POLITICAL SUBDIVISION -- ENDED NONPROFIT BECAUSE IT'S NOT A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION IT WOULD NEED TO PROVE THAT IT WAS FINANCIALLY UNABLE TO PAY I SAID THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE NONPROFITS THAT. IS IT DOESN'T THE D. W. R. POINT SOUNDS LIKE MAYBE NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE OR IF SOMEONE LIKE BUT IT'S ABOUT THE NONPROFIT WELL ACTUALLY CAN I GET YOUR SENSE SENATOR JUST. AN OPENNESS TO WORKING THROUGH THAT ISSUE GOING FORWARD ABSOLUTELY I JUST NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS. TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN ON THE ON THE ON THE FUND RIGHT FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ANY ANY ISSUES BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND TO REQUIRE THEM TO BE PAYING. CONSTRUED CONSISTENTLY INTO A FIND WHERE THERE'S THERE'S NO BENEFIT TO THEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A JUDICATA ANYTHING DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. IT'S A BURDEN THAT SO YEAH WE CAN WE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT THAT WOULD BE GREAT BECAUSE I I I I TOTALLY. EMPATH I'MTHERE WITH YOU ON THE THE FREE RIDER CONCEPT OF YOU KNOW LEGAL CANNABIS GROWS AND ALL THESE OTHER SORT OF BENEFITING FROM THESE REGULATION NOT. ITCHING IN AN AND ALL THE THE WATER DISTRICTS AND ALL THE OTHER FOLKS -- BEARING LINE SHARE IT IS WORRY ABOUT IMPACTS ON THE NONPROFIT THAT I'D HAVE A LEGITIMATE STAKE IN IT I FEEL -- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN MEET THE THRESHOLD THAT SO MAYBE WE IF IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY MAY WE CAN. WORK THAT THROUGH BEFORE PROHIBITION SEE WE CAN DO -- OKAY -- RAISE YOUR DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY. NO NO WHAT WE'RE OKAY WITH IT THE ONE OTHER THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS JUST HOW HOW DOES THIS. HOW DOES THIS DIFFER A WAR IN YOUR VIEW IMPROVE ON THE BCP WE ALREADY PASSED THAT CAN BE -- FOR YOUR SPONSORS OR WHOMEVER BUT WE ACTED IN BUDGET SUB TO I THINK WE MADE A RUEFUL HOW WOULD THE IMPLEMENTATION WORK. WITH THIS SO WHAT COULD WE WITH THIS SORT OF WITH THIS REQUIRES. TO REVISE THAT B. CPD DO SOME NEW ACT. MY ANALYSIS IS THAT THE IS. IT THIS IS A BILL -- THE BEASTIE P. IS IS IS IS THE FORMAT FOR MAKING SURE THERE'S MONEY. FOR THE HEARING. OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO BE TO BECOME OPERATIONAL AT SOME POINT HOW WE CHANGE THE FUNDING FOR IT -- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND? IT. HAD A DIGGING DEEP HERE YEAH YEAH BECAUSE I NEVER DID SHARE A BUDGET COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH I SAT ON HIM. IT'S MY BELIEF THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THE MECHANICS THEN GET CHANGED -- BOB BY OPERATION OF LAW WITH THE WITH THE A BILL IF IT'S SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND AND THEN IT IT SENSE IT'S FOR NEXT YEAR WOULD KICK IN THE NEXT YEAR AND THE NEXT YEAR WE WOULD HAVE WHATEVER BCP FOR THIS YEAR FOR THE CURRENT WATER BOARD FILMING MEDIC IF THE FUNDING. FOR THAT NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. IT STARTS IN JUNE AND JULY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL -- BUT THAT. LATE CLOSED. I APPRECIATE THAT THE THE OPPONENT'S RAISING AN ISSUE AND I I PLEDGE TO WILL WILL WORK ON IT. HE LOOKED. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THANK YOU I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. OKAY SO MOVED BY THE VICE CHAIR OF THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. THE MINISTER AYE AYE JONES JONES I ALLEN PORGES OF EURO. CARILLO AYE HERTZBERG HUESO JACKSON MONEY [inaudible] OR JUST. WE'RE JUST -- FIVE I'D. OR I WILL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON PAUL WE HAVE THAT AS FOR VOTE. ALL RIGHT YOUR MORRELL. THANK YOU [inaudible] YEAH. SO -- FILING WHAT ELEVEN SENATOR. IS THE FIVE FIFTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS SB FIVE FIFTEEN IS A NARROWLY FOCUSED BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD FUEL FOR BIOMASS FACILITIES WITH BIRAM CONTRACTS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN ISSUED AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION CALLING FOR THE CPUC TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EXPIRING BIOMASS CONTRACTS AS PART OF THE CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIA HAD AN ESTIMATED. A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD AND DYING TREES. HELLFIRE PUT TOGETHER A MAP COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS HIGH HAZARD JONES IDENTIFYING AREAS THAT COULD BE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A DEAD TREE HITTING A POWER LINE OR BLOCKING THE ROAD. THE CPUC RESPONDED BY REQUIRING THE UTILITIES TO PROCURE FIVE FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ACTED IN PASSED SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WHICH REQUIRED ANOTHER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEG OF MEGAWATTS OF BIOMASS ENERGY TO BE. PROCURED. IN ALL THERE ARE SEVEN CONTRACTS SIGNED AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO MANDATES AND THEY ARE REFER REFER TO IS BIRAM CONTRACTS. ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED TO GET A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF FUEL FROM FROM THESE HIGH HAZARD ZONES HOWEVER THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THIS REQUIREMENT. IS THAT FOREST WASTE. THAT IS FROM HIGH HAZARD ZONE NOW COSTS MORE THAN FOREST WASTE THAT COULD START THEY COULD ACTUALLY START A WILDFIRE. SOME OF THESE FACILITIES PAY A PENALTY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF HIGH HAZARD ZONE FUEL WHICH HAS A RANDOM TARGET THAT WHICH WAS A RANDOM TARGET SAID ON THE LAST NIGHT OF SESSION. WE NO LONGER HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION DEAD TREES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DEAD TREES AND WE HAVE AN UNHEALTHY AND OVERSTOCKED FOREST WITH EXCESS FUEL AND A CAT. CATASTROPHE IN WAITING WITH REGARDS TO WILDFIRES. THE NAPA COUNTY WILDFIRE DID NOT OCCUR IN THESE HIGH HAZARD ZONE AND NEITHER WAS THE PARADISE FIRE. RATHER THAN WAIT AND TELL A DEVASTATING WILDFIRE DESTROYS A COMMUNITY -- BEFORE EMOVING THE FUEL WE WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE EASIER ISSUES AND TRY TO PREVENT THE NEXT WHILE FIRE. SB FIVE ONE FIVE EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF HIGH HAZARD ZONE FUEL TO INCLUDE AREAS WITHIN A WILDFIRE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT CAL FIRE ANNOUNCED EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AS WELL AS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE CAL FIRES MAP WHICH SHOWS MODERATE HI IN VERY HIGH IN HAZARD ZONES. THE BILL IS SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS IN OUR FOREST AND HELP PROTECT COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES WHERE THERE IS EXCESS FEEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- SIX SEVEN ZERO DOESN'T SUPPORT WELCOME. GOOD MORNING I'M JEFF OLSON A REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORESTER WITH CASCADE RESOURCE CONSULTANTS AND I HANDLE FUEL PROCUREMENT FOR BERNIE OR POWER. BIOMASS ENERGY FACILITY IN EASTERN SHASTA COUNTY. AS MY TEST MY FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION ALSO MENTION I SERVICE THE VOLUNTEER FIRE KEEP MY TOWN AND ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH I ALONG WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHERS ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO HELP SAVE PARADISE FROM THE CAMPFIRE. AN EXPERIENCE WHICH IS DRAMATICALLY HEIGHTENED MY SENSE OF URGENCY FOR REDUCING VIRUS IN OUR FORESTS. LIKE MANY BY MASS FACILITIES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BERNIE FORCE POWER NEARLY CLOSED ITS DOORS UNTIL IT WAS SAVED BY THE BYRON PROGRAM. WHICH ALLOWED PLANS TO CONTINUE OPERATING WHILE DIRECTING THEM TO SOURCE MATERIAL FROM HIGH HAZARD ZONES ARE ACCESS TREE MORTALITY HAD OCCURRED. AT THE TIME THIS MADE SENSE A HUNDRED MILLION TREES ARE DEAD STATEWIDE. OVER IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE STATE WAS RUDELY AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT THE GREATEST THREAT TO OUR FORESTS AND OUR CITIZENS HAD SHIFTED FROM DEAD TREES TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES CAPABLE OF WIPING ENTIRE COMMUNITIES OFF THE MAP IN MERE HOURS. CASE IN POINT WHEN CAL FIRE MADE ITS HIGH HAZARD MAPS MULTIPLE WATERSHEDS COVERING PORTIONS OF PARADISE AND CON CAL TO NOT HAVE THE REQUISITE TREE MORTALITY TO WARRANT DESIGNATION AS HIGH HAZARD. FURTHERMORE NOT ONE OF THE EVACUATION ROUTES OUT OF PARADISE WAS DESIGNATED AS A HIGHER PARTY TEAR ONE'S OWN NEITHER WAS THE TRANSMISSION LINE WHICH ALLEGEDLY STARTED THE WORST FIRE IN STATE HISTORY. WITHOUT SUCH DESIGNATION BOMBERS FACILITIES SUCH AS BERNIE FIND THEIR HANDS TIED FROM HELPING FILL REDUCTION EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS. I BELIEVE THESE FACTS ALONE IN LIGHT OF THE CAMPFIRE ILLUSTRATE THAT THE THREAT HAS SHIFTED SINCE INCEPTION OF BYRON PROGRAM. IN CLOSING I WOULD OFFER THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO BIOMASS FOR TREATING OVERSTOCKED FORESTS. THE COMBAT THIS CRISIS I URGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE HAT THE PRIORITIES FOR THE BYRON PROGRAM MUST ALSO INCLUDE REDUCING THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE IN THE STATE WITH SB FIVE ONE FIVE BEING A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. YOU. WELCOME BACK IF YOU. LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS BILL IN IN HERE'S WHAT IT DOES NOT. TO THIS BILL DOES NOT ALTER ANY RULES FOR TIMBER HARVEST OR CHANGE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL RULES. THIS BILL DOESN'T ALTER ANY EXISTING UTILITY PURCHASE CONTRACTS. AND IT DOESN'T IMPACT CONSUMER COST. WHAT IT DOES IS IT ALLOWS FOR WASTE? FROM FIRE PREVENTION FORCE PROJECTS TO BE EFFICIENTLY UTILIZED. AND IT RECOGNIZES THAT CALIFORNIA'S FOREST MANAGEMENT GOALS ARE EVOLVING. WHEN SB EIGHT FIFTY NINE WAS ENACTED? ARE FORCED ISSUES WERE DEAD AND DYING TREES IN THIS YEAR'S. SO THE BIRAM CONTRATS CALLED FOR DEALING WITH THOSE DEAD TREES. EARLIER THIS YEAR CAL FIRE EXPANDED THE CRITERIA TO INCLUDE DEAD TREES FROM AREAS WERE FORCED FIRE OCCURRED. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE MIRROR THE MATERIAL THAT CAN BE USED IN BIRAM CONTRACTS FROM THE DEAD TREES. AND THE BURN TREES. THE DOCTOR THOSE TREES THAT ARE AT RISK. THE VERY FORCED FUELS THAT NEED TO BE REMOVED TO MEET OUR FIRE PREVENTION GOALS. HOW FAR HAS DEVELOPED A MAP OF AREAS AT RISK FOR FIRE? THE BILL IS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. ALLOWED BY A MASTERY BE REMOVED FOR FIRE PREVENTION PURPOSES IN AREAS THAT WERE VERY HIGH. HI AND MODERATE RISK. AS ALLOWEDFOR FOR IN THE BIRAM CONTRACTS. THIS BILL WAS AMENDED IN THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE. THE NARROW THAT DEFINITION TO JUST THE VERY HIGH RISK AREAS. WELL ARE AN ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO PROTECT A BROADER RANGE OF COMMUNITIES. WE'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT -- AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. AS IT MOVES IN THE DIRECTION OF PROTECTING MORE COMMUNITIES WELL MEETING OUR FIRE PREVENTION GOALS. SB FIVE FIFTEEN IS ACTUALLY SIMPLE BILL. WITHOUT IMPACTING EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE CONSUMER COSTS. IT ALLOWS CALIFORNIA. NEED IS FIRE PREVENTION GOALS BY FISSION LEE UTILIZING FORCED WASTE FROM THE AREA'S MOST AT RISK FOR FIRE. THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] OTHERS SUPPORT. AFTERNOON JOHN KENNEDY WITH WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'SFORCED PLAN AND HAVE SEEN WAY TOO MANY OF THE RECENT CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES SO WERE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF ANY EFFORTS TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE FOR SELF BUT ESPECIALLY TO REDUCE WILD VIRUS. WE SEE THESE BY MASS DISABILITIES AS A CRUCIAL TOOL TO HELP US GET THERE TO SAVE LIVES AND THIS BILL PROVIDES A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO KEEP THOSE. PLANS AN OPERATION THANK YOU. AFTER MR ERA MEMBERS MIKE MONEY GOING TO BE HAPPY THE FOREST PRODUCTS INDUSTRY NATIONAL LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. ABOUT TWENTY TWO THOUSAND EMPLOYEES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THIS BILL THANKS SIR. JULIE MILLINOCKET ON THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ABOUT MASS ENERGY LINES SUPPORT THANKS. RESEARCHER MEMBERS CHRIS MAKAYLA ON BEHALF OFHUMBLE AND MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS ROBERT SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. OR IN THERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT SEEN NONE OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. YES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE I'M BRIAN A WEEK YOU AT THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY -- ME START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND FOR THE FOR THE AMENDMENTS MADE AFTER THE ENERGY -- COMMITTEE -- THAT DID HELP TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL WHICH IS THAT. IT SET THE NEXT SO BROADLY THAT IT ESSENTIALLY WASHED OUT ANY ABILITY OF THIS PROJECT PROGRAM. TO FOCUS -- TO FOCUS ATTENTION AND RESOURCE. I'M COMMUNITY AND THE HIGHEST RISK AREAS BY JANE TAKING OUT THE TIER. TWO WE DID GET RID OF THE MILLIONS OF ACRES WERE ESSENTIALLY DIRECTION FROM FOCUSING ON THE HIGHEST -- HIGHEST PRIORITY WHICH IN OUR OPINION IS. HOMES -- COMMUNITIES IN THE AREAS DIRECTLY INTO THAT. THAT IT IMPROVED IT WE STILL HAVE THAT EFFECT WITH THE TIER THREE I FEEL LIKE THOSE THOSE AREAS DEFINITELY FOCUS MORE ON THE AREAS THAT WE WOULD ALL WANT TO SEE -- PRIORITIZED BUT I DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE. I'M ON THE COMMITTEE AND AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS THE TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THOSE MAPS -- THOSE MAPS STILL FAIL. TO PROVIDE US COMMUNITY PROTECTION ON THEIR OWN AND WHAT WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE [inaudible] IS. A PRIOR THE ABILITY NOW. FOR PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE EXT. EXTRACTION OF WOOD IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST. THAT ARE CLOSEST TO AND MOST. THAT'S A BALL FOR BIOMASS PLANTS ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS EXPANDING HOW EASILY. DOM THOSE BOUNOUS PLANTS CAN PULL FROM THE AREAS THAT ARE CLOSEST TO THEM THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE US ON THE PHONE. HOME PROTECTION BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE US COMMUNITY DEFENSIBLE SPACES. AND AGAIN I FEEL LIKE THIS TEN CHILE -- ON A PROJECT THE PROJECT LEVEL MAY ACTUALLY BE DISTRACTING US FROM THE WORK OF ON HOME PROTECTION. THAT SAID THOUGH THE LAST THING TO MENTION FOR ME IS THAT -- RATHER THAN CATEGORICALLY EXPANDING THE DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE BIOMASS FEEDSTOCK. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS BEST SITUATED TO MAKE THESE INTENSELY FACT SPECIFIC DETERMINATION. AND ALREADY HAS A SYSTEM IN PLACE TO DO -- RECENT CPUC RESOLUTION -- INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES HAVE THE POWER TO AMEND BIRAM CONTRACTS TO ALLOW FACILITIES TO HELP SALVAGE BIOMASS FROM THESE. AREAS I'M TOWARD THEIR STOCK REQUIREMENT AFTER A WILD FIRE EVENT -- AND AND ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY IN RESPONSE -- TO BY REDUCTION PROJECTS COMMISSION RULED THAT THESE AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS -- AND AS ASSIST. FOR DOING THAT. AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE OVERRIDE THAT KIND OF SITE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS. THAT SAID -- BUT THAT WAS INITIALLY PUT IN PLACE WAS SPECIFICALLY. IN RESPECT WITH RESPECT -- TO BOTH BUYER OUTRAGE THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR YOU KNOW. AND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT AN ART. WITH THAT WE DO -- YOU SEE MORE READ. OR THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU. I'M SEEN NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION MEMBERS QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE MOTION FROM CENTER BOARD YES -- ONE QUESTION I JUST HAD FOR YOUR EXPERTS WHILE THEY'RE HERE. WE TALK A LOT OF FORESTRY. TODAY BUT THE FEEDSTOCK ITSELF IS NOT LIMITED I I KEEP THINKING BACK. TO THE CHAPARRAL AND SMALLER DIAMETER. YOU KNOW -- FUELS THAT ARE AT VERY PREVALENT IGNITION SOURCE IN. SEVEN EVEN PARTS THE CENTRAL VALLEY NOT THE BIG TREE STUFF WE'RE TALK ABOUT WITH SOME THIS DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES. HIS BIO ENERGY THE ONLY POSSIBLE SO SOLUTION. OUT THERE FOR THOSE KINDS OF THE STOCKS ARE THERE ANY ALTERNATIVE MARKETS THAT ARE STARTING TO SHAPE UP WHERE WE HAVE. EITHER I MEAN I THINK WE HEARD FROM OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS COUNCIL. WORKING COMMITTEE BUT JUST TO GET A SENSE I MEAN I I KNOW THIS IS ONE PART OF THIS THE SOLUTION THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE BY JUST. I DON'T KNOW AND I'M TRYING TO GET A A BETTER MY HEAD AROUND ESPECIALLY WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF HIS HAZ STUDY FROM THE UC I KNOW IT'S SORT OF OUTSIDE. BUT YU'RE THANK YOU CENTER YEAH THE FIRST OF ALL OF YOU. WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES. WOULD BE THE CHAPARRAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OAK WOODLANDS AND AND THE NAPA VALLEY AREA OR ARE A KIND OF FOR FOREST -- IN EACH OF THOSE. SEVEN PRODUCTS FROM A RUB RESOURCES IN THOSE AREAS HAVE DIFFERENT USES THERE'S NOT A LOT OF USE FOR CHAPARRAL. NOT MUCH RIGHT -- OKAY IS IT HAS SOME LIMITATIONS -- GIVEN ITS SIZE -- ALL ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND THAT THE IT WAS OAK THAT WAS IN THE M.. IF THE DRAW IN PARIS. MAYBE THEY WANT IN THE WORLD I DON'T KNOW. BUT I THINK THAT IT THE IN THE IN THE SHORT TERM -- PROBABLY BIMASS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO BIO ENERGY OF LONGER TERM. THERE ARE SOME NEW WOOD PRODUCTS COMING -- THEN WE'RE NOT THERE YET CALIFORNIA BUT CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER SOME OF THE MASTER BURKE -- DOES IT HAVE SOME USE FOR SMALLER MATERIAL -- THE KIND OF WASTE MATERIAL THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT CAN OTHERWISE BE PRODUCTIVELY USED -- SO -- YOU KNOW THE CONTRACTS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST -- FOR BIO RAM A CONTINUE TO BE SHORT TERM CONTRACTS ARE NOT A AND THOSE. OF WE'RE JUST MAKING IT. THIS BILL EASIER TO USE THAT MATERIAL BUT CAL FIRE HAS SPECIFICALLY DENTIFIED AS COMING FROM AREAS OF VERY HIGH RISK. OF FOR FIRE [inaudible] INSTEAD -- BUT I RECOGNIZE THIS IS ONE PART OF THE SOLUTION I I IT'S BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS MEASURE BUT I'M. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A SOLUTION SET LOOKS LIKE BESIDES JUST PRESCRIBE FIRE EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE CHAPARRAL AND I THESE MAY NOT BE THE THE RIGHT PLACE TO DO IT BUT I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE OPEN TO ALL SUGGESTIONS. TO COMPLICATE THINGS IS DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WITH THE BILL BUT I'M HEARING MORE AND MORE FROM THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WASTE -- THAT HERE TOO FOR COULD COULD HAVE BEEN -- USED A NOW WHAT IT'S OPEN BURNING IF YOU JUST PILE IT UP AND YOU YOU LIGHT A MATCH AND YOU GET NO ENERGY -- FROM IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S JUST IT. IT COSTS TOO MUCH TO TRANSPORT. AND ANY TO WASTE PRODUCT IN THE SOONER YOU GET RID OF IT. THE BETTER OFF YOU ARE INTEL THE WE WE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES WITH WITH WASTE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME OF THE LONG TERM SOLUTIONS AND IT'S IT'S FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AND TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED. ALL THE PLASTIC THAT THEY USED TO GET SHIPPED TO CHINA OFF OF OF THE AG IS RIGHT NOW READING THIS -- BUILD UP AND SO. MORE TO COME ON THAT. OKAY WITH THANK YOU FOR THAT. SHE THE OPPOSITION CONCERN ALSO THEY RECKON IT NO THE NARROWING IT GO WORKING WITH US. THEIR MONEY AROUND ANYWHERE HERE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FOR MOVE CENTER BOARD JUST AS A MOTION -- THERE ALLEN YOU'RE RIGHT. VERSE SO I'M WHERE I WORKED ON IT. IT WILL BIO AND GAS STANDARD AND RAN INTO SOME OF THESE BOMB OUT WITH A CHALLENGES BUT I DO THINK. I FIGURE OUT A IN A SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY OF APPROACHING THIS QUESTION I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE YEAH. HAVE I I I MEAN I I I I CERTAINLY DO HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL STAY VERY ENGAGED IN THIS BILL MOVIE FOR ITS ENSURE THAT THE WORST FEARS OF SOME OF OUR FRIENDS. FROM OUT I MEAN YOU'RE NOT REALIZED WITH AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S DANGER -- FROM A FROM A PERSPECTIVE. ON THIS AT THE SAME TIME. YEAH WE DO HAVE A LOT OF OUR MASS OUT THERE AND IT'S GOING TO WASTE AND YOU'RE GIVEN OUR ENERGY CHALLENGES. WE GOT AT YOU KNOW WE ARE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IF WE CAN DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HARM FIREMAN SO I I GUESS I MIGHT MY REQUEST OF YOU IN THE AUTHOR. MISTER CHAIR IS IS. THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT THE IF YOU SEE ME THIS BOOK ALMOST OR THE I MEAN IT'S A VERY ENGAGED IN DURING THAT. WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THIS WORLD WILL TRULY BE SEEN. I YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT ON VIGILANCE I THINK YOU EVEN HEARD IT FROM. ARE SOME MEMBER EMERITUS OF MISTER GORDON HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT THE BILL -- DOESN'T DOESN'T DO THIS IN THE BIO RAM PROGRAM BUT IN TERMS OF IMPACTS ON HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANNING PROCESS. SEEK WERE ALL THOSE ISSUES. I'M IF IF FOR SOME REASON THERE'S SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE PUTTING PRESSURE IMPACTING ON THAT YOU CAN BE DARN SURE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT IT BUT I THINK THIS IS NARROW ENOUGH. MOVE ALONG TODAY WITHIN THE CONFINES THAT EXISTING PROGRAM SO -- ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE. ALL RIGHT AND ONE OKAY.
