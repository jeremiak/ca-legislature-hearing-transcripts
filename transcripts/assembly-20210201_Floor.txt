AND IT WASN'T JUST A FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHO'S A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR A FAMILY MAN BUSINESSMAN. IN A TRUE AMERICAN AND CALIFORNIAN SUCCESS STORY. CACCIA WAS BORN IN LEBANON IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. HE MERRY TO ROXY THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR THEY WERE BLESSED WITH TWO INCREDIBLE KIDS GARAGE AND IRENE. HE IMMIGRATED TO SAN LUIS OBISPO CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE ATTENDING CUESTA COLLEGE AND CAL POLY. WE'RE GRADUATED WITH A DEGREE IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. DURING COLLEGE SHE WORKED AT A SHELL GAS STATION. WHERE HE HONED HIS PEOPLE SKILLS AND HIS BUSINESS SKILLS EVER THE PRACTICAL MIND. EVENTUALLY CATCH A BOAT THAT GAS STATION FROM THE OWNERS ACQUIRED ANOTHER ONE. UNTIL THE THIRD ONE FROM THE GROUND UP. CACHO EVENTUALLY WAS DRAWN BY HIS INCREDIBLE PASSION FOR THE COMMUNITY TO PUBLIC SERVICE. HE RAN FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR WHERE HE SERVED FOR TWELVE YEARS THREE FOUR YEAR TERMS. ACCOMPLISH MORE THAN WE CAN EVEN DISCUSS IN A SHORTER JOURNEY MEMORY FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTY. THEN HE RAN FOR STATE ASSEMBLY WHERE HE SERVED WITH MANY OF. OUR COLLEAGUES IN THIS BODY FOR SIX YEARS. UNTIL IT WAS TURNED OUT. HE WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST BELOVED POLITICAL FIGURE IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY USE PRAGMATIC. HE WAS A CONSENSUS BUILDER HE WAS A GENTLEMAN. HE WAS ALSO MY MENTOR. I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST APPROACH KOCH ABOUT RUNNING FOR HIS SEAT WHEN HE TURNED OUT HE GAVE ME TWO PIECES OF ADVICE HE SAID FIRST. MAKE SURE YOUR WIFE'S A 100% ON BOARD. AND HE SAID SECOND. IF YOU DO IT. GET IN EARLY AND GO FULL THROTTLE. AS I THINK ABOUT IT THAT' PRETTY DARN GOOD DECISION MAKING LIFE FOREVER FOR ANYTHING MAKE SURE IT'S RIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILY AND IF YOU DO IT. GO FULL THROTTLE. HE WAS ALWAYS FAMILY FIRST. THERE ARE MANY CALLS AND LUNCH IS OVER THE YEARS. DURING MANY CIGAR SMOKING SESSIONS OVER THE YEARS. HE ALWAYS EVERY TIME WE MET HE ASKED ABOUT MY FAMILY FIRST. HOW SHAUNA ARE THE KIDS YOU TALK ABOUT FAMILY. WE TALK ABOUT OUR MUTUAL LOVE FOR CARS. AND THEN WE DID EVENTUALLY GET AROUND TO POLITICS BUT SOMETIMES WE NEVER DID. I TELL YOU WHAT HE LOVED PEOPLE HE ALWAYS PUT PEOPLE FIRST. WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY READ ASKING WHAT WAS GOING ON HE ASKED ME ABOUT. YOU GUYS. HIS FORMER COLLEAGUES. HEY HOW'S COOPER DOING HAS JIM WOOD. HOW'S SPEAKER. HE WAS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST NONPARTISAN PERSON I'VE EVER MET IN ELECTED OFFICE. HE WAS A CONSENSUS BUILDER. HE CAME FROM A COUNTRY THAT WAS TORN APART BY WAR AND I BELIEVE I BELIEVE THAT THAT CAUSED HIM TO ALWAYS SEEK PEACE FIRST. AND HE TOOK THAT INTO EVERYTHING HE DID LIFE. HE WAS ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY. HE FUNDED STARTED FIRST FIVE MINUTES IN THE SPECIFIC. YEP ON THE FOOD BANK MEALS ON WHEELS WE'RE WAS A NEED CULTURE ACTION ALWAYS WITH HIS DOLLARS WITH THIS TIME. YEAH BOUNDLESS ENERGY. I REMEMBER MEETING WITH THE LOW MAYOR WHEN I WAS FOR RUNNING FOR THE ASSEMBLY HE SAID WELL YOU GOTTA BE LIKE TAX YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO GO TO A THE QUANTITIES IN ROTARY YOU GOT TO BE EVERYWHERE THE- KOCH'S YOUR MODEL. I SAID WELL I DON'T HAVE ENERGY SO WE NEED TO PLAY B. THAT'S NOT WORK. HE WAS. WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST NON PART. ELECTED OFFICEHOLDER I'VE EVER MET. HE VIEWED THE WORLD NOT IN TERMS OF PARTISANSHIP. BUT IN TERMS OF PEOPLE THAT COULD BE HELPED. AND PROBLEMS THAT COULD BE SOLVED. HE WAS DEEPLY PATRIOTIC. HE WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM. HE GAVE BACK TO HIS COMMUNITY AND HIS COUNTRY. SO I ASKED WE ADJOURNMENT REPROACH. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER LIKE HIM. MAY WE ALL LEARN FROM HIS EXAMPLE. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM. MISTER NAJARIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEGES WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT I RISE TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY. OF CULTURE CHARGIN A BUSINESS OWNER AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND A COMMUNITY LEADER. AND VOLUNTEER. FOR MANY HE'LL BE REMEMBERED AS A QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY BUT TO THOSE OF US CLOSE TO HIM AND WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO. GET ACQUAINTED WITH THEM. THROUGH OUR RESPECTIVE CAREERS AND LINES OF WORK HE WAS A FRIEND AND A MENTOR. BORN IN JALALABAD LEBANON IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE TO ARMENIAN PARENTS A JUDGE AND IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN SEVENTY ONE. WHERE HE WOULD EVENTUALLY NEED HIS LIFE PARTNER AT OXY. CONTINUE HIS EDUCATION AND BECOME A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNER. HE GRADUATED FROM CAL POLY. WITH A BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION DEGREE AND THROUGHOUT THE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND- DELVED PLUNGED INTO HIS BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. A JUDGE ON FIRST SERVED AS COUNTY SUPERVISOR. THEN WAS ELECTED IN WHICH HE WAS ELECTED TO A NINETY EIGHT UNTIL HE THEN. WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. I CAME TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH CACHO AFTER I WAS ELECTED- TWO YEARS LATER- AND JUST ON A PERSONAL BASIS- THERE'S A CERTAIN CONNECTION WHERE TO ARMENIANS MEET ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE FROM ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE BOTH IMMIGRANTS. HIM FROM LEBANON AND ME FROM IRAN JUST THE ASPECT TO ASPECTS. MANY ARMENIANS HAVE BEEN SHOCKED AND AROUND THE WORLD AFTER THE GENOCIDE IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. AND- SECOND WITH THE DIFFERENT TUMULTUOUS. REGIMES THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST THAT FORCED MANY OF US BELIEVE OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES THAT WE FINALLY SETTLED AND THEN ARRIVE TO THE UNITED STATES- YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BURDENS AND CHALLENGES. FEARS TREPIDATION AND EVERYTHING THAT'S CARRIED. SO IT WAS WONDERFUL TO HAVE A PARTNER WHO UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WERE. AND TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER UP TOGETHER AND TO MAKE MEANINGFUL WORK NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SIMPLY OBISPO ELOQUENTLY SAID. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORLD FROM A PRISM OF TORMENT AND FIGHT. IF YOU THEN WANT TO SEEK PEACE AT ALL TIMES. SO IT WAS NOT AT ALL UNIMAGINABLE HOW CONCILIATORY- AND HOW- HOW MUCH HE REVERED BEING ABLE TO GET TO THE COMMON DENOMINATOR WITH EVERYONE. AS OPPOSED TO FINDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIGHT. AND FOR THAT REASON. HE WAS VERY MUCH RESPECTED BY ALL HIS COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE AISLE AND WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY. SO MUCH SO THAT A CHARGE AND WAS THE ONLY REPUBLICAN TO BE APPOINTED AS HE COMMITTEE CHAIR UNDER A DEMOCRATIC SPEAKER AT LEAST IN MODERN TIMES. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SALLY THIS BILL AND I WORKED SINCE LAST MARCH TO TRY TO FIND AN- OPPORTUNE TIME. TO HAVE HI JUST FAMILY. BE HERE WITH US. SO THAT- WE CAN CELEBRATE AND HIS LIFE AND HIS CONTRIBUTIONS WITH THEM. UNFORTUNATELY THAT WASN'T MEANT TO BE BECAUSE SINCE MARCH WE JUST WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE TIME- AND GIVEN THIS PANDEMIC GIVEN THE LOCKDOWN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE OPERATING AND- WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM JOIN US- BUT I WANTED TO.

WITH THIS MOVE GEORGETTE AND MAINLY OPEN THE DOORS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MANY OF US LEGISLATORS AND STAFF WOULD NOT ADVANCE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE IN THIS BUILDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR NEARING WORK OF WOMEN LIKE GEORGETTE A MORA. GEORGETTE WAS BORN IN THE MANZANAR CONCENTRATION CAMP DURING WORLD WAR TWO. AND SHE NEVER FORGOT WHERE SHE CAME FROM. SHE DEDICATED HER ENTIRE LIFE TO FIGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR WHO ARE PART IN GEORGE'S LEGACY.

MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALACE VERDES. I MET GEORGETTE WHEN I WAS STILL IN COLLEGE AT UC BERKELEY. PROBABLY IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. AT THAT TIME LIKE MANY OTHER BERKELEY STUDENTS WE WOULD COME UP TO THE CAPITAL TO MEET WITH LEGISLATORS AND TO MEET WITH STAFF AND- AS MY COLLEAGUE EARLIER STATED THERE WERE NO ASIAN LEGISLATORS TO BE WHERE. BECAUSE AT THAT TIME ASIAN AMERICANS DIDN'T HAVE ANY REPRESENTATION AMONGST THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY. ELECTED MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. BUT IT WAS FOR MEETING WITH HER. EMILY TOM WITH A POINT WHERE BOTH WORK FOR CENTER PRO TEM. FAVORABLE THAT WAS ONE OF OUR HIGH BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY WAS NOT FOR TO MEET. AND ACTUALLY SEE ASIAN OF. WERE IN THE STATE. COULD I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT YOUR- DECIDED TO WORK IN THIS CAPITAL B. SHE KNEW WHAT IT FELT LIKE DECISIONS ARE MADE OF YOU. YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR COMMUNITY. WITHOUT YOUR INVOLVEMENT BECAUSE IT WAS THIS VERY DECISION DURING WORLD WAR TWO THAT SET HER AND HER FAMILY HER COMMUNITIES INTO INTERNMENT CAMPS NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY MISTAKE THAT WE HAVE COME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM THAT WE CONTINUE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR. BUT IT WAS THAT DRIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS ACCESS. BUT THERE WAS OPENNESS TRANSPARENCY THAT THEIR RIGHTS THAT YOU HAD TO BE. IN THE ROOM WITH THE DECISIONS WERE BEING MADE. AND FOR ME AT THAT TIME WHEN I FIRST VISITED HER IN SENATOR BIRDIES OFFICE I COULD NEVER IMAGINE WE'RE NEVER DID REALLY IMAGINE MYSELF- EVER WORKING IN THE CAPITAL. OR FRANKLY BEING A MEMBER OF THIS ESTEEMED BODY. BUT IT WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF HER DRIVE. HER LEADERSHIP. FOR SO MANY OF US THAT WE SAW SOME PATH TO SACRAMENTO. AND THAT WE KNEW IT WAS NOT JUST ABOUT REPRESENTING OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL VOICE BUT WE ARE COMMUNITIES WORSE. THAN BEING THERE AS A FIGHTER FOR OUR COMMUNITY. THE FOR ALL THE VERY ISSUES THAT UP IN TERMS OF CIVIL RIGHTS. SO I ALSO WANT TO RISE AND JUST THINK GEORGIA BURKE IN TURN OF. EVERYTHING SHE HAS MEANT TO ME PERSONALLY. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF HER HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AND THE INFORMED SHE'S HALF IN THIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHANG. AND MR FROM THE REAR THE THANK YOU. YOU ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED.
