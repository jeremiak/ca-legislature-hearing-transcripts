IN OUR CURRENT TAX CODE THAT IS

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:14.639
LED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO GIVE

EVERY CITY IN THE STATE.

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:24.315

RICHEST CORPORATIONS IN THE

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:44.769
THAT.

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.737
ONLINE RETAILERS HOWEVER.

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.239
HAD HE ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHERE

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:51.108

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:11.162
THIS RESULTS IN A RIGGED PROCESS.

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:12.663
DRIVING CITIES TO ACCEPT

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.465
INCREASINGLY ONEROUS TAX SHARING

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:15.566

THEIR ONLINE SALES AND FROM THE

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:29.814
SALES TAX REBATES.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.148
OFTEN CITIES WILL GIVE THESE

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:33.050
CORPORATIONS MORE THAN HALF OF

00:37:33.117 --> 00:37:35.453
THE SALES TAX REVENUES ALLOCATED.

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:38.456
TO THEIR JURISDICTION.

00:37:38.522 --> 00:37:40.257
THESE COMPANIES BENEFIT AT THE

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:42.593
EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.095
AT A TIME WHEN OUR CITIES ARE

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.329
STRUGGLING TO FIND PUBLIC

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.698
PROGRAMS.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:50.001
COMPANIES ARE SIPHONING BILLIONS

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:51.469
IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:54.138
THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS.

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:55.339
FURTHER WHILE THESE DEALS ARE

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.108
OFTEN TOUTED FOR CREATING JOBS

00:37:57.174 --> 00:37:58.409
AND HAVING SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC

00:37:58.476 --> 00:37:59.977
BENEFITS.

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.078
IN MY VIEW THESE CLAIMS ARE

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.446
DUBIOUS.

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.814
SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:04.949
REQUIRED THAT THE PROMISED JOBS

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.118
OR EVEN CREATED.

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:08.719
AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO HOWEVER

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:10.321
JOBS IN THESE WAREHOUSES.

00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:11.555
ARE GRUELING.

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.891
LOW WAGE AND IN MANY CASES LACK

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.660
BENEFITS.

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.361
THE CITY'S NEED REAL JOB

00:38:17.428 --> 00:38:18.729
OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:20.665
FAMILIES NOT A RACE TO THE

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:23.901
BOTTOM. FOR THESE REASONS SB

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:24.502
FIVE THIRTY ONE WOULD PROHIBIT

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.437
ANY FUTURE SALES TAX SHARING

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:27.905
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN LOCAL

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:28.806
GOVERNMENTS.

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:30.574
AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS.

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:32.877
IT HAS NO EFFECT ON ANY EXISTING

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:35.212
DEAL WHEN MAKE THAT CLEAR AGAIN.

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:37.214
WOULD HAVE NO AFFECT ON ANY

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:38.482
EXISTING DEAL.

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:41.118
IT TAKES NO MONEY FROM ANY CITY.

00:38:41.185 --> 00:38:42.553
AND IT DOES NOT REDUCE THE SALES

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.288
TAX REVENUE THAT ANY CITY CAN

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:46.157
RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE.

00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.091
THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.426
SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.493

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.228

00:38:51.295 --> 00:38:52.730

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.228
OUR TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR HAD

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.130
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO BORROW ON

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.431
THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE.

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:08.666

TRIPLE DOWNEY BORROWED THREE

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:16.640
TIMES MORE. TO MAKE THIS

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:18.175
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY --

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:20.678
FOR THE PARTICIPANTS SOME

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:21.111
HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN

00:41:21.178 --> 00:41:22.012
PARTICIPANTS FROM AROUND THE

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:24.081
STATE IN THE PORTFOLIO THE

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.317
ORANGE COUNTY INVESTMENT POOL.

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.652
AND WHEN I RAN IT WAS COUNTY

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.120
WIDE AND I WOULD BUMP IN THE

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:31.622
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:32.957

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:35.593
OUT WHY AM I GOING AFTER THE

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.862
GOOSE THAT IS LAYING THE GOLDEN

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:39.096
EGGS IT'S THIS GUY WHO IS

00:41:39.163 --> 00:41:40.664
GENERATING ALL THIS EXTRA

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:42.399
INTEREST INCOME THAT'S HELPING

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:43.500
US.

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:45.703
BALANCE OUR BUDGET DURING THE

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:49.106
NINETEEN NINETY RECESSION.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:51.208
MEMBERS KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.176
OF BUSINESS THAT WE ARE TAKING

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:53.577
CARE OF AN ACID THE COULD PLEASE

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.846
KEEP OUR CONVERSATIONS TO A

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:56.447
MINIMUM.

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:57.414
THERE ARE MORE LOCKED I

00:41:57.481 --> 00:41:58.716
APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING THE

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.651
FLOOR IS YOURS SIR.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:01.151
MISTER PRESIDENT YOU CAN

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:03.087
INTERRUPT ME ANYTIME.

00:42:03.153 --> 00:42:06.156
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

00:42:06.223 --> 00:42:08.192
SO WHAT NO ONE NO ONE REALLY

00:42:08.259 --> 00:42:10.094
LOOKED INSIDE THE BLACK BOX NO

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.095
ONE SAID WHAT'S HE DOING HE WAS

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:12.663
RUNNING A HEDGE FUND HE WAS

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.131
RECALLED THE CARRY TRADE TODAY

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:15.065
AND WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.200
RISING ON THE SHORT END OF THE

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.534
YIELD CURVE WHICH ARE DOING.

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.770
RISE WE SPEAK YOU GET OUT OF HIS

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.672
BUSINESS AND HE DID NOT THIS

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:23.274
ENGAGE.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.408
SO WITH THAT THE COUNTY OF

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.210
ORANGE IMPLODED WE LOST ONE

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:28.279
POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS

00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:30.281
BECAUSE THE PARTS OF THE SCHEME

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.815
STARTED TO MOVE IN THE WRONG.

00:42:31.882 --> 00:42:32.850
DIRECTION AND THE COLLATERAL

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.852
CALLS ARE MADE IN AN ORANGE

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:36.620
COUNTY WATCHED A BOATLOAD.

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:37.988
OF MONEY COLLEAGUES I'VE SEEN

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.925
MORE SCHEMES IN MY TIME NOW THE

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:45.429
PUBLIC SECTOR -- REDEVELOPMENT.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.097
YOU KNOW IF A IF IF WE CAN

00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:48.699
CONSIDER A SMALL PART OF OUR

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:50.301
CITIES BLIGHTED THEM.

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.669
AND THAT HELPS WITH A TAX

00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.437
INCREMENTAL A REVENUE TO THE

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.039
CITY THEN WHY DON'T WE DECLARE

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.507
THE WHOLE CITY BLIGHTED.

00:42:56.573 --> 00:42:57.474
ONLY A TWO CITIES IN ORANGE

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:58.776
COUNTY THAT DID JUST THAT AND

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:00.811
NOW THEY'RE STRUGGLING AFTER

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:02.746
REDEVELOPMENT WAS REMOVED.

00:43:02.813 --> 00:43:04.281
ANOTHER INTERESTING SCHEME WAS

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.250
INTEREST RATE SWAPS IF YOU CAN

00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:08.018
BORROW MONEY AND USE THE SHORT

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.186
END OF THE YIELD CURVE AND GET A

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.854
REAL LOW RATE FOR A PORTION OF

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.890
THE DEAL WHY DON'T YOU DO IT FOR

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:13.991
THE WHOLE DEAL.

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:15.626
WELL THAT WORKED OUT GREAT YOUR

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:17.261
HERO UNTIL THE SHORT END OF THE

00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:19.797
YIELD CURVE WENT UP IN.

00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:20.397
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE WE HAD

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:21.799
ANOTHER COUNTY GO BANKRUPT OVER

00:43:21.865 --> 00:43:24.034
THAT IDEA BECAUSE THEY WENT AND

00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:27.371
BORROWED FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:30.407
BIRMINGHAM -- ALABAMA AND SO

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:30.708
THEY FILED.

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:32.209
THEN THE LARGEST BANKRUPTCY

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:33.711
FILING CHAPTER NINE BUMPED

00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.679
ORANGE COUNTY OUT OF FIRST PLACE.

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.614
SO THERE'S ALL THESE INTERESTING

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:40.551
IDEAL IDEAS AND SO THESE

00:43:40.617 --> 00:43:41.919
SALESMAN COME INTO TOWN TO GIVE

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:43.554
GIVE THESE GREAT.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.955
OPPORTUNITIES AND NOW WILL.

00:43:45.022 --> 00:43:46.557
WE HAVE STRUCTURE DEALS TO BUILD

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:49.360
WAREHOUSES IN UNIQUE AREAS AND

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:50.894
THEY GET ALL THE SALES TAXES

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.529
IT'S BEING SUCKED OUT.

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:55.499
OF OTHER AREAS THIS IS A SCHEME

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.034
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO LAST VERY

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:58.302
LONG.

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:00.170
BECAUSE YOU JUST THE ONE BALLOT

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:01.939
MEASURE OR YOU NEED ONE BILL OUT

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.907
OF THIS BUILDING AND YOU CAN

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:05.409
STOP THIS.

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.111
AND THOSE CITIES WILL FEEL THE

00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:08.946
PAIN BUT IT THEY WILL BE.

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:11.215
PART OF A LONG SUCCESSION OF

00:44:11.281 --> 00:44:13.784
CITIES THAT BELL FOR INTERESTING

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.319
SCHEME AND THE AND THE PARTIES

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:17.454
THAT ARE PROPOSING THESE SCHEMES

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.056
ARE MAKING UP A BOATLOAD OF

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:19.256
MONEY.

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.691
IN FEES.

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.092
THEY'LL BE HAPPY UNTIL SOMEONE

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.094
REALIZES THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.462
BEEN SOLD A BILL OF GOODS.

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:27.064
AND SO THIS BILL IS RIGHTEOUS

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:28.465
THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT THING TO

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:29.199
DO IT'S SAYING.

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:31.869
STOP THIS NONSENSE NOW NO MORE

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:33.404

THIS MEASURE -- WE HAVE IN THIS

00:44:58.028 --> 00:45:00.731
LEGISLATURE SINCE NINETEEN

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:01.331
SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN THE VOTERS

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:02.833
MADE A CHOICE. TO A LIMIT

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.868
PROPERTY TAXES IN THE MANNER

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:05.702
THEY DID.

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:07.337
HAVE COME UP WITH A SERIES OF

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.006
MECHANISMS SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:11.408
WORKED SOME OF WHICH HAVEN'T.

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:13.277
IT'S RESULTED IN WHAT WE WHAT

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.112
WAS NO OFTEN KNOWN IN THE IN THE

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:16.680
IN THE PARLANCE IS FISCAL IS

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.981
ATION OF LAND USE AND I WOULD

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:18.916
SUGGEST.

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.784
THAT AS WE DEBATE THIS HOUSING

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:23.654
ISSUE AND WE LOOK AT THE VARIOUS

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.123
CAUSES THIS RELOCATION OF

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.425
BRADLEY BURNS MONEY INTO THESE

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:30.727
KINDS OF PROJECTS WHERE WE CAN

00:45:30.794 --> 00:45:32.763
INCENTIVIZE THESE FOLKS.

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.264
THESE BIG BUSINESSES TO DO THIS

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:36.600
STUFF FOR BIG BOX RETAIL OUTSIDE

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:39.136
OF BIG CITIES AN AUTO MALLS IN

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:41.205
THE LIKE HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.406
OF THE CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:44.775
CITIES HAVE NOT BEEN INCENTIVIZE.

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.143
THE BILL THE HOUSING AND YET

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.411
WHEN THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:45:47.478 --> 00:45:48.812
FACTORS IT'S ONE OF THE

00:45:48.879 --> 00:45:50.814
UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES SO I

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.983
SUPPORT THIS BILL I JOIN WITH

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.985
THE AUTHOR IN THIS BILL I DO

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:56.453
KNOW AND I THINK THAT THE POINTS

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.555
MADE BY THOSE IN OPPOSITION.

00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:00.390
ARE CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:01.892
THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF HARDSHIP.

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.560
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT THERE

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:05.729
ARE BETTER WAYS TO MAKE THE FIX

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:06.864
THERE ARE BETTER WAYS WE NOW

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.665
HAVE OPPORTUNITIES OWNS WHERE WE

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:10.868
CAN USE INCOME TAX FROM

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:11.735
TAXPAYERS.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.403
THERE'S A NUMBER OF NEW THINGS

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.805
ON THE SHELVES THAT WILL PROVIDE

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.573
INCENTIVES THAT DON'T HAVE THE

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.642
DOWNTURN THAT THIS IS DONE BY

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:20.878
PROMOTING BIG BOX RETAIL

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:22.346
PARTICULARLY OUT OF LARGE CITIES.

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:24.381
YOU KNOW AND AND THAT IT'S

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.183
CREATED THIS PROBLEM WITH FISCAL

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.584
IS ATION OF LAND USE WE HAVE TO

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:29.319
TRY TO WORK ON THIS FOR A NUMBER

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.587
OF YEARS I THINK THIS IS A

00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:32.689
IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD.

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:33.991
ASK YOUR EYE BELOW THANK YOU AS

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.969
THAT.

00:46:46.036 --> 00:46:46.803
MANY OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.039
HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE CURRENT

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:50.507
RULES AND I TWO THREE SHE WHY A

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.575
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD PURSUE

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:54.511
THAT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL THE WAY

00:46:54.578 --> 00:46:55.913
OUR TAX STRUCTURE IS.

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.148
ALL OVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.317
HAVING TO COMPETE FOR REVENUE.

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:00.851
NOW.

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.920
I STAND HERE THOUGH AND SAY WE

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.288
NEED TO DEFEND ALL OF OUR LOCAL

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:05.355
GOVERNMENTS.

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:06.890
I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE

00:47:06.957 --> 00:47:08.192
LEGISLATION.

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:09.893
DURING THE RECESSION.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.862
THAT FIRST.

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:16.233
BROKE THE THAT ARE.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.269
PRACTICE FIRE INTERNET RETAILERS

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:22.172
OF BASICALLY DENYING THE STATE

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:23.874
IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:25.742
SALES TAX REVENUE.

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.945
AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING SO LET'S

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:29.446
JUST TALK AMAZON FOR MINUTE.

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.480
AMAZON'S.

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:33.250
BUSINESS MODEL WAS BASED ON

00:47:33.317 --> 00:47:36.220
GIVING YOU AN AYE THE PERCEPTION

00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:37.688
THAT WE COULD BUY IT CHEAPER

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:39.923
FROM THEM BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PAY

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:42.359
SALES TAX NOW UNDER CALIFORNIA

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.728
LAW WE STILL OWE THAT SALES TAX.

00:47:44.795 --> 00:47:47.297
BUT THAT LEFT OUR FRANCHISE TAX

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:49.967
BOARD INTO IT LEFT THEM HAVING

00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:50.567
TO COLLECT FROM EACH OF US

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.436
INDIVIDUALLY VERY INEFFICIENT

00:47:52.502 --> 00:47:54.037
AND BASICALLY LEFT A LOT OF

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.239
MONEY ON THE TABLE.

00:47:55.305 --> 00:47:56.673
SO COURSE DURING THE RECESSION

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.508
THERE ARE LOTS OF FACTORS BUT WE

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:01.011
SAW OUR BRICK AND MORTAR BILL.

00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:02.980
BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE STATE

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:06.316
ARE DOWNTOWNS COLLAPSING AS

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:09.386
RETAILERS CLOSED AND INTERNET

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.387
SALES GREW.

00:48:10.454 --> 00:48:12.990
TODAY WE NOW INTERNET SALES

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:16.260
ACROSS THE US HAVE NOW.

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.528
REACHED A HIGHER NUMBER THAN

00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:20.264
BURKE AND MORTAR SO WHILE THIS

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.598
BILL IS NOT GOING TO SAVE ALL

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:24.101
BRICK AND MORTAR IT LEAST ALLOWS

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:26.637
A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:29.072
AND IT ALLOWS EVERY LOCAL

00:48:29.139 --> 00:48:32.843
GOVERNMENT TO GET SOME SHEER OF

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.878
THOSE PURCHASES THANK YOU WHEN I

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:38.048
MAKE VERSES ALLOWING JUST A FEW

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:40.851
LOCAL OVERNMENTS. TO IN A WAY

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.619
GIVE AWAY MONEY THAT SHOULD GO

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:44.955
TO THE STATE AND SHOULD GO TO

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:46.857
ALL OF US GIVE AWAY JUST SO THEY

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.692
CAN CONSOLIDATE.

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.461
IN YES GET REVENUE THEMSELVES

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:53.897
BUT WE LOSE WE EAT THE WHOLE

00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:57.067
STATE AND EVERY CITY IN THE

00:48:57.134 --> 00:48:59.770
ENTIRE STATE COFFERS LOSE AS A

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.038
RESULT OF THE DEAL.

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:04.508
SO LET'S GO BACK TO FAIRNESS TO

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:06.443
PROTECTING WHATEVER BURKE AND

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.211
MORTARS WE HAVE LEFT.

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:10.514
AND THIS DOES NOT UNDO THE DEAL

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.949
SO FAR IF I WERE CARRYING THE

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:13.583
BILL I MIGHT ADD I TRIED TO UNDO

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:20.257
THE DEALS BUT WHATEVER IT

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.459
DOESN'T SO THOSE VIEW.
