NON CONSENT ITEM WOULD BE MISSED PROM LOGGERS BILL AB NINETEEN NINETY THREE. THIS AS A SUPPORT RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- GOOD MORNING MEMBERS HAPPY THURSDAY. I AM HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON AB NINETEEN NINETY THREE THE FAMILY CARE GIVER ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT. THE ACOUSTICS ARE SO GREAT IN THIS ROOM I FEEL LIKE I WANT TO SING STANDING HERE BUT I WILL NOT. THAT'S NOT PART OF THE BATTLE. I PROVIDERS WHO CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO AREN'T TO A CHILD OR SPOUSE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. CALIFORNIA LAW EXCLUDES PARENT AND FOUND IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROVIDERS FROM RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PAYMENT. ABOUT 22% OF AYE IT JUST SAYS PROVIDERS. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND MOSTLY FEMALE FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY THESE PROVIDERS WHO MAY BECOME UNEMPLOYED DUE TO THE DEATH OF THEIR LOVED ONES. ARE LEFT WITHOUT A PAYCHECK OR ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT. AB NINETEEN NINETY THREE WOULD EXTEND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY. TO A PARENT OR SPOUSE I HSS PROVIDER WHOSE PATIENCE AND LOVE ONE HAS DIED OR ENDS UP AND EXTENDED CARE. CARE GIVERS HELP CLIENTS WITH MEALS PERSONAL CARE NEEDS AND EVEN PARAMEDICAL SERVICES LIKE MANAGING MEDICATION BLOOD TESTING AND CATHERINE ARE YOU. IN MANY CASES I HSS CARE GIVERS BECOME THEIR CLIENTS ONLY LIFELINE ESPECIALLY DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WHEN WE MUST MAINTAIN PHYSICAL AND FACIAL DISTANCING. THE COLBERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS SHINING A LIGHT. ON THE PROBLEMS THAT CALIFORNIA WORKERS FACE SUCH AS LACKING PROTECTIVE GEAR CHILD CARE OR EVEN ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WE MUST ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE FOR ALL WORKERS INCLUDING SPOUSE AND PARENT I HSS PROVIDERS ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT IN TIMES OF GLOBAL CRISIS. AND IN NORMAL TIMES TO. OR BECAUSE OF I'D JUST AS CARE GIVERS MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES STATEWIDE RECEIVE THEIR CARE AT HOME INSTEAD OF IN A NURSING HOME. BY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR UNNECESSARY TRIPS TO HEALTHCARE FACILITIES HOME CARE PROTECT THE VULNERABLE POPULATION FROM KOBE NINETEEN AND PREVENTS THOSE FACILITIES FROM BEING OVERCROWDED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY AND GET SOME FOR THAT. UNFORTUNATELY STAGNANT WAGES AN INSUFFICIENT BENEFITS HAVE CREATED A DANGEROUS. SHORTAGE OF CARE GIVERS. AS A RESULT MANY CARE GIVERS ARE PARENTS AND SPOUSES WHO HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR CAREERS TO DO THE WORK THEMSELVES. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS A BASS LINE PROTECTION THAT MOST WORKERS RELY UPON EVEN IN NON CRISIS TIME. WE NEED A PERMANENT SOLUTION SO THAT FAMILY CARE GIVERS HAVE BASIC EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS ALL OF THE TIME. IN THE SPIRIT OF MAINTAINING A HEALTHY SOCIETY THAT TAKES CARE OF ITS WORKERS I URGE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TO A PARENT AND SPOUSE I HSS PROVIDERS. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS CHRISTINE CHRISTINE ABOUT HAMILTON WITH THE U. D. W. ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY AND KATHLEEN WILLIAMS WITH BABY SO SPECIAL. THANK YOU. PERSON WHO'S IN THE GALLERY WHO'S RIGHT HERE IN THE ROOM. AND I THINK THERE'S A MICROPHONE UP THERE AND YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND. ARE FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES ALL RIGHT GREAT. HI MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR MY NAME IS CHRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON I AM WITH YOU W. THE UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS WE REPRESENT AYE HSS PROVIDERS IN TWENTY ONE COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. UNDER THIS BILL IS A HUGE PART ALREADY FOR US ON HAS BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS- WE ARE THANKFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER COM LONGER FOR TAKING THIS ISSUE ON AND FOR ALL THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE SINCE SIGNED ON TO BE CO AUTHORS- AND OF ESPECIALLY THE FACT THAT WE HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE BILL IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY. FOLKS HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH CLIMB BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE STATE. THAT WE'RE ALL IN- THERE IS SOME MINOR COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BILL. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IT IS BECAUSE WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC THAT WE NEED TO PASS THIS BILL AND HAVE A- RECTIFY THIS TERRIBLE EXCLUSION THAT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES. FOR THESE WORKERS WHO LITERALLY SACRIFICE THEIR CAREERS AND THEIR JOBS OUTSIDE THE HOME TO CARE FOR THEIR MOST VULNERABLE LOVED ONES. I HEARD YOU IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY PARENTS OR SPOUSES WHO ARE CARING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES IN THE HOME. TO TRY TO FIND OF PEOPLE TO TALK TO THAT ARE IN THAT POSITION. BECAUSE THEY REALLY WILL OPEN YOUR HEART AND YOUR MIND AND RECOGNIZE WHAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH AND THE- SACRIFICES THAT THEY ARE MAKING. OUR JOB IN CALIFORNIA IS TO MAKE IT A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AND IT CAN'T BE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL IF YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE PARENT OR THE SPOUSE. WE CAN SEE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT IS LITERALLY THE ONE THING THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE. IN THEIR HOMES AND FOOD ON THE TABLE WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR INCOME BECAUSE THEY HAVE SOMETHING THEY HAD NO CONTROL OVER. AND THAT IS THE SAME CASE WITH THESE. HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE 85% OF WHOM ARE WOMEN. THEY WILL HAVE NO CONTROL AND NO OPTION IF THEIR LOVED ONE THEIR CHILD OR THEIR SPOUSE EITHER PASSES. OR IS HOSPITALIZED. IN THEIR LEFT WITHOUT A PAYCHECK. SO I'M URGING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL TODAY THIS IS A RIGHTEOUS BILL. THE PANDEMIC IS SHOWING IS EVEN MORE NECESSARY NOW THAN IT WAS BEFORE. AND I WANT TO POINT THAT AGAIN 85% OF THESE ARE WOMEN AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HELPING WOMEN INVADE POVERTY STAY IN THEIR HOMES IN OFF THE STREETS. TO BECOME HOMELESS SO THANK YOU.

WITNESS VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM WHETHER ANY PERSONS IN THAT ROOM WHO ARE WANTING TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. CURRENTLY NOT. WELL THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR I SEE MISTER GRAYSON'S MICROPHONE IS A GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I NEED TO ASK IN AND THEN ALSO A FOLLOW UP WITH A COUPLE COMMENTS- AND THESE QUESTIONS MAY BE BETTER SERVED FOR THE WITNESS- AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR. BUT IS THE AYE HSS WORKER CONSIDERED A TEN NINETY NINE WORKER AND ALSO- WOULD THERE BE PAYMENT MADE INTO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT. AND THEN ON AVERAGE HOW MUCH IS AN AYE HSS WORKER MAKING. SO I WILL LET AND MISS HAMILTON ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT YES THE I. BECAUSE THOSE WERE FOR WOULD BE PAYING IN TO- THE FUN. AND THEN CRISTINA DO YOU WANNA HELP WITH THE OTHER BY- BUT THE AVERAGE YES THANK YOU SO I JUST AS WORKERS ARE W. TWO EMPLOYEES THEIR EMPLOYERS RECORD WELL THE ACTUALLY HAVE THREE DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS- BUT THEY ARE EMPLOYEES THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THE SECOND QUESTION- SORRY CLOSEST. BY THE AVERAGE PAY FOR THE AVERAGE PAY THE AVERAGE PAY STATEWIDE IS THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND TWENTY SOMETHING CENTS JUST ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND WE I'M SORRY. YOUR FINE I JUST- SO WE CAN GET TO THE OTHER TWO AND LAST QUESTIONS AND THAT WAS WHAT OF WHAT ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN OF FOR. AND I HSS WORKER TO BE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- THE WAY THAT THIS LIKELY PLAYS OUT IS THAT THEY LOSE EMPLOYMENT BY VIRTUE OF THEIR CLIENT EITHER OR BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OR THEY ARE PLACED INTO AN INSTITUTION. OR THEY PASSED AWAY- LIKE ANY OTHER WORKERS WHO IS ELIGIBLE IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD GO TO THE E. D. D. WEBSITE AND FILE A CLAIM. SAME FORMULA SAME WAITING PERIODS SAME EVERYTHING THAT- ANY OTHER WORKER WOULD HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE SAME RULES- WE DID DO THE CALCULATION SO THE AVERAGE NUMBER. OUR CLIENT IS A HUNDRED AND- ONE SO IF A WORKER WORK A HUNDRED ON THAT THE MINIMUM WAGE THEIR WEEKLY BENEFIT. THE ESTIMATE WOULD BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK. IF THEY WORK THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF HOURS THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED. THROUGH AYE AYSHA ASSESS THEIR MAX AT THEIR WEEKLY BENEFIT WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK. THAT'S THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED UNDER LAW AND THE BENEFIT WOULD BE FOR TWENTY SIX WEEKS. AND HOW HOW LONG COULD THEY GET THAT BENEFIT FOR. WHEN YOU SIX WEEKS THAT'S THE MAXIMUM LENGTH. THAT WAS MY LAST QUESTION IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR IN MOST OR MANY CASES- I HSS WORKERS CARING FOR A RELATIVE HAS HAD TO LEAVE ANOTHER JOB. LEAVE A CAREER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR RELATIVE- AND THAT OTHER JOB MOST LIKELY PAID SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WAGE AND INCLUDED THE CERTAINTY OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS A PART OF THAT JOB. AND IN SOME CASES IT UP IT IS A SINGLE PARENT FOR US- PERSON A SINGLE PERSON SINGLE INCOME HOUSEHOLD THAT IS CARE FOR A CHILD AND THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE. SINS VIABLE OPTIONS OTHER THAN THEM LEAVING THAT CAREER AND COMING UP OR STE HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILD OR THEIR- I'M- I'M MORE TO CRY. I A GET THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING FROM ONE CRISIS TO ANOTHER- AS FAR AS ECONOMIC- I KNOW THERE'S SOME ECONOMIC COST OF THIS. I WILL LEAVE THAT UP TO A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE- AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS AND SUPPORT THIS TODAY ON THE MERITS OF THE BILL. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULDBE PROVIDING. AND DID SO AS EMPLOYMENT AND A JOB THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON- MR VOEPEL HAS HIS MIKE OF PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR WITH YOUR QUESTION OR COMMENT. YES MISTER TERRY COLLEAGUES I HAVE A I SUPPORT THIS BILL TO GOOD BILL BUT I HAVE A TECHNICAL QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. AND REQUEST PERMISSION TO READ THE SHORT PARAGRAPH THAT I HAVE A QUESTION ON. YEAH PLEASE GO AHEAD VERY WELL. THIS SECTION OF THE BILL IS THIS BILL WOULD INCLUDE A CHANGE IN STATE STATUTE THAT WOULD RESULT IN A TAXPAYER PAYING A HIGHER TAX WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION THREE OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN A OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND THOSE WOULD REQUIRE FOR PASSAGE THE APPROVAL OF TWO. OF THE MEMBERS BEACH HOUSE IN THE LEGISLATURE MY QUESTION IS. WHO'S THE TAXPAYER IS THAT THE EMPLOYER IS IT SPLIT BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE IS IT A- INCREASE IN OUR STATE INCOME TAX IS IT A BOND THAT WILL BE FLOATED I DON'T KNOW WHO THE TAX PAYER IS. THAT IS A GOOD TECHNICAL QUESTION I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT RIGHT NOW- AND I I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE WE GO THANK YOU I CAN'T SEE THE SONGS. I'M TRYING TO SEE OKAY THERE WE GO- THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION SO. THE WAY UNEMPLOYMENT WORKS- THIS ISN'T. IT NATIONALLY THE EMPLOYEE YOU'RE- PAYS A CONTRIBUTION INTO THE U. I FIND ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEE IT'S MANDATORY FOR THE EMPLOYER. FOR THE 80% OF I JUST AS WORKERS THAT ARE COVERED ALREADY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS THEIR CONTRIBUTION INTO THE U. I. FUND FOR THEM. THE CONTRIBUTION IS TECHNICALLY A TAX THAT'S WHY THE LEDGE COUNCIL CUTE AS A TWO THIRDS BUT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO TAX ON ANYBODY OR ANY BUSINESS OR ANYTHING RESULTING FROM THE BILL IT IS THE STATE MAKING THE CONTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF THIS SUBSET OF NEW WORKERS. AND THE CONTRIBUTION JUST TO GIVE YOU A PERSPECTIVE. LAST YEAR THE LAST FISCAL YEAR THE HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTED TWENTY ONE MILLION% ON BEHALF OF THE 80% OF THE WORKERS SO THAT'S HOW WE EXTRAPOLATED THAT THE COST FOR THIS. ALERT SUBSET OF 20% WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY SIX MILLION DOLLARS SO THERE'S NO THEY WOULDN'T THEY WOULDN'T BE DRAWING FUND THE FUN WITHOUT HAVING PUT CONTRIBUTIONS IN. IT I THERE'S BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE SOLVENCY OF THE FUND IS A VERY LEGITIMATE THIS WOULD MAKE CONTRIBUTION WE OF THE NEW GROUP. WHO THEN MAY. HAVE TO YOU KNOW CALL ON A IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. SO QUICK FOLLOW UP THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT I SAW IT IN THIS BILL TECHNICALLY THEN IT'S A STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAX IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD THAT BE A CORRECT STATEMENT. YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL- FOR YOUR QUESTION ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER MAYES JUST A QUICK COMMENT ON THE POLICY OF SUPPORT THIS I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR OF THAT'S OKAY. THANK YOU. BEEN POINTED OUT THIS SIR. THIS BILL WILL LARA. BE ONE OF THE MANY- SUBJECTS IN THE BUDGET. PROCESS WHICH THIS YEAR WILL BE. REMARKABLY MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN PAST YEARS. OUR JOB IS TO LOOK AT THE POLICY. AND EIGHT THE VICE CHAIR HAS A SIGN ON AS A CO AUTHOR ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISS CALM WATER WOULD YOU LIKE TO WRAP IT UP PLEASE YEAH I WANNA THING- MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR- VERY ACUTE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ABOUT THE FUN. I WON I THINK THE VICE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LOAD I CARE FOR AND ASKING TO BE A CO AUTHOR- IN THAT THEY WOULD FOR SIGNALING. SUPPORT OF SOME KIND HE CO AUTHOR HERS WILL BE- ADDED ONCE THIS GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THIS BILL EXPOSES. FRAGILITY THEN OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM- I'M AND WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE PLACING AN ARBITRARY VALUE. ON A ON A CLIENT- AND DENYING EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS ACCESS. BECAUSE A PATIENT OR CLIENT HAPPENS TO BE A SPOUSE. OR A CHILD. THE I RESPECTFUL ASK FOR YOUR THOSE ON EIGHTY NINE. NINETY THREE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISS KAMLAGER AS I SAID THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT POSITION. AND IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS WILL GO AHEAD AND DO A ROLL CALL VOTE.

HELLO HI WOULD WOOD HI THAT'S FOURTEEN ZERO. FOURTEEN ZERO WELL DONE MYSTERON LONGER WELL DONE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE ALL THE TESTIMONY FROM VARIOUS INTERESTED PARTIES. SO THE NEXT BILL PRESENTATION IS MY OWN BILL I'VE GIVEN THE GAVEL TO MR MAYS SO WATCH OUT. Q. ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SIX MR DALY CITY FORGERS. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS MEASURE PROPOSES A MARKET BASED SOLUTION. TO THE CURRENTLY DISRUPTED MARKET FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN OUR STATE HI FIRE RISK REGION'S. EXISTING LAW LIMITS THE FLEXIBILITY FOR INSURERS TO FIND ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE WAYS TO ISSUE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGH FIRE WRIST REGIONS AND COUNTIES. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES EACH INSURER WHO CHOOSES TO PARTICIPATE. TO FILE A SPECIFIC PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THAT INSURANCE NEEDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IF THE PLAN IS APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. AND ONLY OF. THE PARTICIPATING IN SURE WILL BE SUBJECT TO A LEGAL MANDATE TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF POLICIES IT OFFERS TO HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGH RISK REGION'S. INCLUDING COUNTIES ADDITIONALLY THE BILL ADDRESSES WHICH COUNTIES THE PROGRAM APPLIES TO AND HAD A MEASURE AND INSURANCE COMPLIANCE. WITH ITS MANDATE TO ISSUE MORE POLICIES. I I'M AWARE THAT THERE ARE PARTY SHOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. AND IF THIS WOULD BE THE TIME. MR MILLER BY THE MICHELLE IT'S GOOD TO A TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT AND- I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME. THEY'VE FOLKS UP OR THAT THEY'RE THEY ON GONNA BE ON THE SCREEN THEY'RE HERE ONE TWENTY FIVE. SAYS GOOD OF THE TESTIMONY OVER. TO THE VIDEO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VIDEO. DO YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND- BUT LET'S GO TO THE TESTIMONY SUPPORT I THINK WE'RE GONNA BE ON VIDEO HERE. THE MOVE THE FIRST WITNESS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SERVE TAYLOR WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION. PRECIADO OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND THE DIGITAL PRECAUTIONS EVERYONE IS TAKING HELP MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY WORK SAFELY- I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT AUTHORIZED TO SAY THAT THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY. CHURCH SO SEE ASIAN PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES A LOT OF ACRONYMS THERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES SHERRI VIRTUES HERE TODAY AS WELL JOIN ME IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN YEAH SB TWO NINETY TWO. WHICH MUST BE ENACTED JOINTLY TO BECOME OPERATE. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE WERE GIVEN PRETTY CLEAR DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO GET COMFORTABLE BEING UNCOMFORTABLE. AND TO WORK ON SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES SOME HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS ARE EXPERIENCING. WITH REGARD TO FINDING  POLICY FROM IT'D BE IT'D MARKETED SURE. WITH THAT IN MIND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE MEASURES PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. IT REQUIRES INSURERS WITHIN APPROVED BY MAPS AND CHARTS MARKET ACTION PLAN TO WRITE HI FIRE RISK AREAS IT WILL ALSO HELP REDUCE RISK AND LOSS. INDIVIDUAL HOME HARDENING A COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE CURRENT INSURANCE AVAILABILITY ISSUES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO UNSUSTAINABLY LOW STATEWIDE AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS. ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER DATA. CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE PREMIUM ONE THOUSAND EIGHT DOLLARS IS 17% BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND ALMOST ONE HALF OF THE AVERAGE PRICE OF HER CAN STATES LIKE LOUISIANA FLORIDA. EVEN THOUGH IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO REBUILD A HOME IN THOSE LOWER COST GULF STATES. SO IN FACT WHILE THE AVERAGE PRICE OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS INCREASED CALIFORNIA IS ONLY RESERVE TEN POINT 6% JUST LESS THAN HALF THE RATE OF INFLATION. SO ANY FEASIBLE SOLUTION TO THE AVAILABILITY ISSUE IN HIGH RISK AREAS. MUST RECOGNIZE THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF LOW AVERAGE RATES AND THE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF LOSSES INCURRED BY HOME INSURERS. AS A RESULT OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES. WHICH AS NOTED BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE DR CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE LOSS RATIOS TO THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. THE STATUS QUO IS UNSUSTAINABLE IN THIS NEW NORMAL. WE THINK THESE BILLS PROVIDE INNOVATIVE APPROACH THAT BALANCES INSURERS RISK IN RATES IN COMBINATION WITH A SUBSTANTIVE EFFORT TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK AND LOSS IN THE LONGER TERM. AND IT IS AN APPROACH THAT INSURERS CAN SUPPORT WITHOUT FEAR OF INSOLVENCY. FURTHER WE DISTRICT REDUCING RISK OF LOSS IS THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE THE UPWARD PRESSURE ON INSURANCE RATES. IN SHORT IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED AND THE COMMISSION APPROVED AND I MAC WE WILL BE BOUND BY THE MANDATE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE THAT COMES WITH IT. WITH THAT UP CLOSE I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE SURE Q. I HAVE A FEW WORDS TO SAY AND THEY WILL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER TAYLOR MOVE UP TO THE NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TODAY THIS IS SOME. VERY DIFFERENT FOR ALL OF US AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ACCOMMODATE- JERRY MCKEE REPRESENT IN THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE ADMITTED HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET- COVERAGE. AND HIGH RISK AREAS. OF IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF RATES AND RISK THAT HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME. THE SOONER WE CAN FIND AT A RATE OF WAYS- TO DO SO WE WILL BE BETTER OFF IN THE HIGH RISK AREAS. WE THINK THIS IS A WORKABLE SOLUTION THAT MANY. WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM AND HOPEFULLY ALSO IMPROVE AVAILABILITY AND THE HIGH RISK AREAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE COMISKEY BELIEVE WE HAVE ANY OTHER BELL. TESTIMONY BUT WE WILL MOVE TO MAKE ME TO USE- SO BY THE TELEPHONE MODERATOR IS THERE ANYBODY THERE TO. DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY IN THE QUEUE. THIS IS FOR THE REMINDER IF YOU'D LIKE. AS A REMINDER IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. IS FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT IS THAT ON THE ME TO USE. HERE FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO ONE TO AT THE TIME SIR. RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. HIS WILL MOVE TO- IS THERE ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. RE GOING BACK TO THE TO THE SCREEN FOR THAT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I UNDERSTOOD THAT WE DID HAVE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR THEY- YES. TWO MORE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TESTIFIED HERE BEFORE YOU ENTERED THE IS VERY UNPRECEDENTED EXTRAORDINARY TIMES MIKE MARTINEZ SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OF INSURANCE HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO ONE SIX SEVEN. I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE HERE BRENT HANLEY. SHARON AND SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE COMMISSIONER HERE WITH ME TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO PLEASE KNOW THAT COMMISSIONER WATER IN THE DEPARTMENT WE DID NOT COME TO THIS DECISION LIGHTLY TO OPPOSE AB TWO ONE SIX SEVEN. HOWEVER THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS MEASURE GREATLY OUTNUMBER ANY BENEFITS TO IT. THE QUESTION AT THE CRUX OF THE DEPARTMENTS OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE IS. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT RATE MAKING PROCESS UNDER PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE AND WHY DO WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL SEPARATE FAST TRACKED PROCESS TO ADDRESS THE BILL ABILITY TO HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE ACROSS OUR STATE. TO DATE THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY CLEAR AND CREDIBLE EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO COMMISSIONER A LOT OF AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT RATE MAKING PROCESS. TO THE CONTRARY THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CURRENT RATE MAKING PROCESS PRESCRIBED UNDER PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE. IS AVAILABLE FOR INSURERS TO REQUEST ADEQUATE RATE TODAY. INDEED INSURANCE COMMIT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE SUBMITTED RATE APPLICATIONS IN UNPRECEDENTED. NUMBERS THESE PAST FEW YEARS. AND WHEN I AM SURE CAN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT A FILE GREAT IS NOT EXCESSIVE. INADEQUATE FOR IN FAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY HAS APPROVED THAT INCREASE IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROVED TWO HUNDRED AND TEN. HOMEOWNERS RATE INCREASES FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN THROUGH TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT MEANS MANY INSURERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECEIVING MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A DIRECT CONTRAST SUGGESTION MADE BY SOME IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT ADEQUATELY APPROVING BREAK REQUEST MADE BY INSURERS. AND AN ASSERTION AND COMMITTEES ANALYSIS THAT RATES ARE ADEQUATE ACROSS THE BOARD. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ALREADY MAINTENANCE DOUBLE DIGIT. AND EVEN TRIPLE DIGIT INCREASES FOR MANY POLICY HOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN HIGH RISK LOCATIONS AND WHAT WE- AND YET THAT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD. CREATE A FAST TRACK AROUND THE CURRENT ESTABLISHED PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE RATE APPROVAL PROCESS AT THE DEPARTMENT WITHOUT CLEAR EVIDENCE. AT THE EXISTING PROCESS DOES NOT WORK. ALLOW N INSURER TO COMPEL EXPEDITED APPROVAL FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR RATE FLEXIBILITY WHICH WILL LEAD TO EXCESSIVE RATES FOR CONSUMERS WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ROAD LOST THEIR COVERAGE. IT'S CIRCUMVENT THE AUTHORITY OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AN EXISTING DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER UNDER REGULATED THE INSURANCE SHOULD BE ENTIRELY INCLUDED AS A FACTOR IN SETTING RATES. AND WE CAN CONSUMER PARTICIPATION AND THE RATE MAKING PROCESS BY RESTRICTING INTERVENOR PARTICIPATION IN THE INSURANCE MARKET ACTUAL PLAN PROCESS. IN CLOSING- JUST THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL UNDOUBTEDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CONSUMER. IT'S OVER TIME WHILE THE SAME TIME WE CAN. CONSUMER PARTICIPATION RATE MAKING PROCESS IN LIGHT OF THE UNKNOWN RAMIFICATIONS OF OUR PANDEMIC WE ARE IN FOR THE LONG TIME I HAD NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO WEEKEND LONGSTANDING CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND HARD WORKING FAMILIES FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE POSTED THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I THINK IS DO WE HAVE ANY MORE A MORE- TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. WE DO A- I WILL GATHER GOING TO GO TO THE TO THE ME TO USE- I KNOW WE HAVE SOMEBODY ON. OKAY TE MODERATOR WE DO SOMEONE GOT A MODERATOR I'VE GOT SOME FOLKS ARE CALLING IN OPPOSITION. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT POSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THE OVER THE PHONE LINE.

YES MISTER BY TERMINATE CHAIRMAN DALY AND MEMBERS ROBERT AROUND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL TRYING TO STAY SAFE AT THE MINE. THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY STRONGLY OPPOSED. TO EIGHTY TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. A BOOK FOR AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN THE FAMILY OF BEAU TECHIES TO BE INCREASED INSURANCE PREMIUM BUT CALIFORNIANS TO THE TUNE OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WITH JUST A FRACTION OF THE SCRUTINY THEY RIGHTLY MERIT. THIS REPRESENTS THE COMPLETE AND RUN AROUND CURRENT PRIOR APPROVAL PROCESS FOR HOMEOWNER INSURANCE RATES.

INSTEAD WE THE REST OF THE PUBLIC A FOURTH RESPOND TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S WHICH WITH AS CONTAINED IN THIS BILL. IN THE CASE OF THE WORK GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN THE CENTURY.

THANK YOU SIR- NEVER GO BACK TO THE MODERATOR IS OR SOMEONE ELSE ON THE LINE AND IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THINK USER AT THIS TIME. OKAY SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE THE ANY JUST ADD ONS FOR OPPOSITION EITHER CORRECT. OKAY GREAT WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR- ANY QUESTION SEVEN I RECOGNIZE MISTER COOLEY. WELL AS I CHOOSE TO STAND I BROUGHT SOME EXHIBITS WITH ME BUT I WANT TO SPEAK. VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THE USUAL WILDFIRE CALIFORNIA IS SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT KIND AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCE BEFORE. YOU KNOW I THINK BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHEN THEY HAD THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE. WE LOST THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS IN THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE IN THE FALL OF NINETEEN NINETY ONE. THAT SHOCKED EVERYBODY. FOR THE NUMBER OF LAWSUITS AND YET THAT WAS IN THE DAYS WHEN FIRE SEASONS CAME AND WENT WE'VE HAD FIRES NOW WERE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND MORE STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN LOST HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOST YOUR AROUND FIRES. I HAVE WITH ME A BUCKLE FROM A TRUNK% IT WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR FIRE IN THE HILLS ABOVE MALIBU. YOU KNOW THAT WAS A DIFFERENT ERA WHEN WE HAD THOSE SORTS OF FIRES. I HAVE WITH ME A PIECE OF A TREE TRUNK. THIS BILL DEALS OF WILD URBAN INTERFACE THIS IS FOR THE WHITE HALL FIRE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR UP HIGHWAY FIFTY CAN BE. A DIFFERENT ERA. THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT THAT FITS TO ME WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ALWAYS DONE. FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS CALIFORNIA LONG INSURANCE AREA HAS BEEN. THAT THE COMMISSIONER SHALL PERFORM THE DUTIES IMPOSED UPON HIM OR HER BY THE PROVISION THE CODE. AND OTHER LARGE RING THE BIZ OF INSURANCE. THE LEGISLATURE DOES SET THE TABLE. ON SO MANY INSURANCE QUESTIONS. WHEN WE REALIZED AFTER NORTHRIDGE. BUT THE PERIL OF EARTHQUAKE WAS GETTING DIFFERENT IN KIND. WE ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. THAT INCORPORATED A PROVISIONAL LAW TWELVE EIGHT EIGHTY POINT SIX. WHO WHO THE DON'T WITH ESTABLISHING A TECHNICAL BASIS FOR EVALUATING EARTHQUAKE RATES. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THE I. AP TOOL THE MARK CONSISTS OF TOOL IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THE LONGEST TIME IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE MECHANISM THAT MARKETS CAN USE TO DO WITH MARKET DISRUPTION. YOU'VE HEARD OF JOINT OF. ASSIGNED RISK PLANS JAY YOU A- OF STATE REINSURANCE STATE PARK SPONSORS FOR A FRIEND MARKET PLAYERS ARE JUST ONE OF MANY TOOLS IN COMMON USE IN THE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE NATIONALLY WHAT DOES IT DO WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE IT CAN FOR. MOST OF YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURERS ARE REALLY MORE FOCUS ON URBAN AREA. WE ARE ENCOUNTERING PROBLEMS ON AND FIRE HAZARD JONES WILDLAND URBAN AREAS. IT WILL ESTABLISH AN INFORMED BASIS FOR ANALYZING THE RISK IN THOSE AREAS IT'S THAT'S THE MARKET ASSISTANCE PLAN IT IS A STUDY. TO UNDERSTAND IT AND MAKE PUBLIC A RESOURCE TO CONSTRUCT TO PARSE THE RESEARCH THERE. THAT THE INSURER IS THEN ASKED TO INSURE. THAT TOOL BECAUSE AS THE PUBLIC TOOL WILL ALLOW THE PEOPLE IN. OF MOUNT SHASTA OR HEALDSBURG OR OF FOR TUNA UP THE COAST. TO LOOK AT THIS TOOL AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT MIGHT BE THEIR WRISTS AS A CITY OR IS A COUNTY IT WILL SHED LIGHT ON THOSE RESTORED AS A PUBLIC TOOL WILL CONFER BENEFITTED PLANNING AND BECAUSE IT IS WILL SYSTEMATIZED EXAMINATION AND DEPTH OF THESE RISKS IT BECOMES A TOOL OF THE PRIVATE MARKET PLACE THAT IS THINKING ABOUT ENSURING. CAN LOOK AT THEIR EXPOSURE LOOKING THROUGH THE LENS OF THIS STUDY. AND THEN- DECIDE THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO COME IN IT KICKS IN WHEN THERE IS A MARKET DISLOCATION. OF SO IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WAY IT IS A NEW TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT TO A DOLLARS OF THESE RISKS. ARE DIFFERENT AND COMBINE. ARTIST SCALE NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN AND WILL ASSIST THE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE TO RESPOND OF. AND THIS IS WHY I WATCH YOU WANT TO POINT OUT HAT THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT IT OUGHT TO BE ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED AS A IN TY READY. AND CAMPAIGN WITH THE SENATE BILL WE WILL ALSO SEE TODAY. AND IT FOR THESE REASONS THE PROVISIONS ARE ACTUALLY NOT SEPARABLE. THAT THE TWO BILLS THEIR PROVISIONS REPRESENTS A- AN INTEGRATED PACKAGE ON HOW TO STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA CHURCH MARKET PLACE AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT JUST AS WHEN THEY ADOPTED. THE C. A THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY AND SET UP THEIR SYSTEM OF RATE SETTING IT CONCLUDES WITH ALL RATE SHALL BE APPROVED BY THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY USE. THIS BILL IS NOT AN END RUN AROUND COMMERCIAL RATE APPROVAL THAT IS ALSO INCORPORATED IN THIS. AND TO THE OBJECTION THAT WELL WE MIGHT HAVE TO RUSH. ALL THE FIRST COMMERCIAL WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE SAME A MARVEL. AND UNDERSTAND AND THINK THROUGH ITS RATE IMPLICATIONS. SO EVERY RATE THAT COMES INTO THIS PLAN WILL NOT BE A CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION I GOTTA FIGURE OUT ALL THOSE BURIED IN THIS THING. IT'LL BE FOUNDED UPON THIS PUBLIC TOOLS SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THE JUDGMENT THAT WE COULD SUPPORT. A RATE PROPOSAL ON OR NINE MAP PLAN TO GET ENSURE INTO AN AT RISK COUNTY. AND AN ACCELERATED PROCESS IT'S IS FOUNDED UPON IS VERY PUBLIC TOOL. I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE SORT OF. OURS IN OF THE WRIST. AND ALLOCATION AND BURDENS. AND ACTUALLY THE FIRST PERFECT BUT I THEIR PROCESS. AND I'VE CHOSEN TO MAKE THESE REMARKS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY FEEL. IT IS A VERY WELL FOUNDER PROPOSAL NATIONAL ASSOCIATION RESEARCH COVER FOR OF WHICH- STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S ACT BORDERS RECOGNIZES. MARKET ASSISTANCE PLANS AS A TOOL TO GET- YOU CAN FIND IT DISCUSSED BY THEM IT IS A- IT IS JUST A TOOL AND I DON'T THINK IT'S STRUCTURED AS A- GIVEAWAY THE INDUSTRY ARE ACTUALLY HAS A WELL BALANCED TO ON BEHALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHANGING TIMES. IN THIS PERIL FIRE. DAVIS COOLEY WILL RECOGNIZE DOCTOR WOULD. I GUESS THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. THIS MIGHT WORK BETTER- DAVIS RIGHT YOU'RE JUST I AM A SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OF FIRST OF ALL- HOW DOES THIS HOW WILL THIS- ACTUALLY- PROTECT THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE AFFORDABLE% POLICIES RIGHT NOW- ARE THERE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE BUILT INTO THAT- AND HOW- HOW WOULD AFFECT THOSE POLICIES. MR WOULD BELIEVE FOR THOSE WHO CURRENTLY ARE INSURED AND HALF POLICIES- THERE WILL BE- THEY ARE- ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THERE'S NO. THERE SHOULD BE NO THE FACT. SO THERE'S THEY SHOULD NOT SEE THE NECESSARILY SEE AN INCREASE IN THEIR POLICY. THEN THE PREMIUMS WITH THIS WITH THIS SOMEPLACE IS OUT OF I DON'T ABOUT THE BEEN DISSIPATED THIS BILL. THAT THIS NEW- A PROCEDURE- THIS NEW PLANNING DEVICE. WOULD. WOULD WE WOULD BEAR THAT RESULT IF IT IT'S DESIGNED TO. TO MAKE THE MARKET MECHANISMS IN COUNTIES IN REGIONS MORE VIBRANT FOR THOSE INSURERS WHO WHO CHOOSE NOT NOT TO OFFER INSURANCE. SOMETIMES THIS WILL GIVE THEM. A PATH TO DO SO. AND THAT OF MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY STIMULATE- THE ABILITY FOR VENTURES ACTUALLY WRITE POLICIES IN THESE AREAS THAT'S THE GOAL MISTER WOOD IS- AND BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE IS A- A BIT OF A CRISIS IN CERTAIN. HIGH FIRE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE INSURERS HAVE PULLED BACK FROM THE MARKET PLACE- AND THIS IS DESIGNED TO BE I DON'T WANT TO. YOU KNOW THE PHRASE CARROT AND STICK IS OVER USE BUT THERE'S AN INCENTIVE HERE- FOR INSURERS TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY- THE COMMUNITY. INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE AND WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP MITIGATION STANDARDS. AND PROTECTIONS FOR EVERYONE AND WE BELIEVE THAT WILL. I DON'T KNOW HILL DRIVE DOWN COSTS BUT IT'LL IT'LL GIVE SOME ASSURANCE ON COSTS. AND THE WHOLE GOAL HERE IS TO GET INSURERS WHO WERE NOT WRITING. ENOUGH POLICIES ENOUGH. POLICIES WE WOULD DESIRE. GIVE THEM- A REASON TO ENGAGE. THANK AND I ONE OF- THANK MISTER COOLEY WHO WAS A JOINT AUTHOR OF THE BILL FOR HIS OUTSTANDING- A WALK THROUGH HISTORY WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM THOSE HISTORICAL EXAMPLES. AND I DIDN'T KNOW THAT MR COOLEY HAS A COLLECTION OF. THE YEAH ARTIFACTS THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM WILL WILL HELLO THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR- OR- IF NOT THEN MR DAILY LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS. MEASURE WILL ONLY GOING TO AFFECT- AND BECOME LAW IF SENATOR RUBIO IS BILL WHICH WE WILL HERE SHORTLY ALSO DOESN'T ALLOW THEIR COMPANION MEASURES. AND THEY WORK HAND IN HAND HER BILL EMPHASIZES THAT THE MITIGATION STANDARDS IN THAT COMMUNITY. OF PLANNING THAT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN SO YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT SOON. I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE MISS DALY AYE WE DID HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND I.

THANK YOU IN FACT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP MR MAYES. YOU DIDN'T GET TOO CARRIED AWAY WITH THE GAVEL THAT'S THAT'S A FIRST FOR YOU YOU KNOW YEAH. AND WE'LL GO NOW TO OUR NEXT BILL WHICH I BELIEVE IS MISTER BLOOM. AB. TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND WILL WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE ISN'T. ISN'T READY TODAY SO WILL BE. I FORGET THE LEGAL TERM BUT WILL HAVE TO ADOPT THOSE AMENDMENTS AND THEN HAVE THE- HAVE THE LANGUAGE TO PREPARE ABSOLUTELY GO AHEAD SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED WITH THAT TODAY ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX WHICH WOULD HELP CONSUMERS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE BUILDING CODE IN PLACE AFTER A MAJOR PROPERTY LOSS. BY PROVIDING BUILDING CODE UPGRADE COVERAGE TO HOMEOWNERS TO HELP COVER THE COST OF BUILDING CODES AT THE TIME OF LOS. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN- AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED TO APPLY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE REFERENCED ON PAGES TWO AND THREE OF THE ANALYSIS. AND OF COURSE THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL THE AMENDMENTS REMOVE ALL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I'M PLEASED TO SAY. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX REQUIRES FIRE POLICIES TO INCLUDE A MINIMUM. OF 10% OF PRIMARY DWELLING LIMIT COVERAGE A AS AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR REPLACEMENT COST OF THE INSURED STRUCTURE. AT THE TIME OF LOS. AS WE ARE ALL TO WEAR OUR STATE SUFFERS FROM SOME OF THE MOST CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES- THAT- WE'VE EVER SEEN AND THAT THIS IS OCCURRED JUST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. LEAVING UNFORTUNATELY MANY CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT HOMES. AND WITH THE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. MANY OF THE HOMES THAT ARE DESTROYED BY THESE WILD CARDS ARE ON THE OLDER SIDE AND ARE NOT UP TO DATE WITH CURRENT STATE AND LOCAL BUILDING CODES. THESE BUILDING CODES LIKELY APPLY TO THE REBUILD BUT ARE UNLIKELY TO BE COVERED BY THEIR INSURER. WHICH LEAVES MANY UNSUSPECTING HOMEOWNERS FORCED TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO COVER THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UPDATED NEWLY ADDED BUILDING CODES. FOR REST JEOPARDIZING THE REBUILD ALTOGETHER- BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE. AND IN SOME CASES THAT WILL RESULT IN UNWANTED SALE OF THE PROPERTY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX WILL REQUIRE ALL RESIDENTIAL FIRE WHAT POLICIES. TO INCLUDE A MINIMUM OF 10% BUILDING CODE UPGRADE COVERAGE TO HELP REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OUT OF POCKET COSTS THAT CONSUMERS ARE FORCED TO PAY. THE AMENDMENTS ESTABLISHED A SIX MONTH DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COMPANIES WITH ENOUGH TIME TO FILE FOR NEW RATES. BUT THE BILL REQUIRE THOSE INSURERS% WHO NEED A FILE- WHO NEED TO FILE A RULE CHANGE OR RATE APPLICATION. TO DO THAT NO LATER THAN APRIL FIRST OF TWENTY ONE. INSURERS CAN THEN BEGIN ISSUING RENEWING POLICIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BILL WITHIN SEVENTY FIVE DAYS FOLLOWING THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS PRIOR APPROVAL OF ACCURATE CHANGE OR RATE APPLICATION. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX IS SPONSORED BY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MICHAEL MARTINEZ THE SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM THIS WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO SPEAK. EITHER BY VIDEO. MISTER MARTINEZ ARE YOU YOU'RE IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE IS VERY A ROOM RIGHT GOOD. YES THANK YOU MICHAEL MARTINEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INSURANCE. COMMISSIONER LOT AS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND HOW IN SUPPORT OF THIS MISSION ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT REALLY WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS MEASURE AND APPRECIATE ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMITTEE- CRITICAL TO COME TO A CONSENSUS WE DO WORK OUT. THAT THE THAT THE AUTHOR HAS THE STATE IN HIS THE- UP BILL INTRODUCTION. AND SO I MAKE THIS. RICH JUST SAY THAT. COMMISSIONER LAW OF HEADS. THIS MEASURE BECAUSE- JUST AFTER THE AFTERMATH OF A MAJOR PROPERTY LOSS. THE HOMEOWNER ATTEMPTED TO REBUILD THEIR HOME A CAN BE FACED WITH THE DISTAL COST OF COMPLIANCE OF COMPLYING WITH CURRENT BUILDING CODES PASSED AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HME. AND SO WHEN HE WAS GOING UP AND DOWN THE STATE THESE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HE WAS HEARING FROM A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS THAT WORDS SIMPLY JUST SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT THE COVERAGE WON'T HELP PAY FOR THE REQUIRED UPGRADE IT'S- INEFFECTIVE I'M A REBEL.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS ANNA BUCK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE HAVE A SUPPORT IT'S AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL- OUR MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BUILDING- MODIFIED TO- THE MODEL THAT THE MANDATORY OFFER EXTENDED COVERAGE AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY- A MANDATE FOR THE POLICY HOLDERS HAVE- MORE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM AT THE TIME OF PURCHASING THE POLICY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISS BUCK. ANYONE ELSE IN THE QUEUE. NO I DON'T THINK YOU SIR PLEASE CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT. OTHER PERSONS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. EITHER VIA EMAIL.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ANY OTHER PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK. EITHER OPPOSE STORE NEUTRAL. THAT APPEARS TO COVER THE TESTIMONY COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR MR BLOOM ON THIS BILL MR VOEPEL PLEASE GO AHEAD. I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS- BUT I'M- GOING TO BE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AND THE REASON IS. IF YOU OWN A HOME THAT'S- BEN BUILT WITHIN EIGHT OR TEN YEARS. PROBABLY DO NOT NEED THIS COVERAGE IF YOUR HOME IS OVER TEN YEARS OF AGE YOU MAY VERY WELL NEED THIS COVERAGE SO. THAT ADDRESSES THAT GROUP BUT THE REASON I'M IN OPPOSITION IS. IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER HOME OR YOU LIVE IN A FIRE PRONE DISTRICT. YOU SHOULD BY THE RIDER THAT'S WHAT THE THEY CALL IT A RIDE. IN PAVE THE ACT ONLY. IN A SENSE IF WE- MANDATE EVERYONE AT THIS EXTRA 10% WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE TAKING PEOPLE. THAT DON'T NEED THE COVERAGE. AND YOU'RE GIVEN A TO- AND CHARGING HIM FOR IT WHETHER THEY NEEDED OR NOT SO IT'S BASICALLY ONE SIZE FITS ALL ALSO IT'S- HOMES IN SAFE AREAS. PAY MORE TO SUBSIDIZE THE HOMES IN UNSAFE AREAS ARE HIGH FIRE AREA. IF A CONSUMER WANTS THE EXTRA COVERAGE FOR THE CODE PROTECTION. THEY CAN PAY FOR IT. SO THAT'S MY BASIC POSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. THANK YOU. MR BLOOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE COMMENTS I GREW UP KIND OF MISTER MARTINEZ- MIGHT BE- AND BETTER POSITION TO. PROVIDE COMMENTS TO THE RIGHT IN RESPONSE. MISTER MARTINEZ IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE POINT. IT'S MADE ABOUT THE SUBSIDY THAT MAY BE INVOLVED.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- IN OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE TUBS FIRE CHANGE MY HOME TOWN OF SANTA ROSA FOREVER. THE FIRE DESTROYED 500-060-0403 STRUCTURES TOOK THE LIVES OF TWENTY TWO PEOPLE. NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE FROM COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT SEND SEND MY STAFF AND I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS WORKING WITH CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES YOU IN OUR BEST TO HELP CONSTITUENTS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. TWO AND A HALF YEARS LATER AND YOU CAN SEE THE REBUILDING PROCESS UNDER WAY ALL OVER CINEMA COUNTY. WE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INCLUDING HOW ILL PREPARED WE WERE FOR THIS NEW ABNORMAL. NOBODY PLANS FOR FIRE TORNADOES OR WILD FIRES THAT BURNED SO FAST AND SO HOT THAT THEY JUMPED EIGHT LANES OF FREEWAY. AND TURNED CAR WHEELS MOLTEN METAL. NOT EVEN INSURANCE COMPANIES PLAN FOR THAT KIND OF DEVASTATION. WE'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH THE AFTERMATH EVER SINCE. AB THIRTY THREE THOUSAND AND TWELVE IS NOT A SILVER BULLET BUT I THINK IT'S A SERIES OF BALANCE STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE BILL DOES FIVE THINGS. IT BUILDS ON THE HOME INSURANCE BINDER THAT MY BILL EIGHT TEAMS AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. HELP CONNECT HOMEOWNERS WITH COMPANIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE BIG ADVERTISING BUDGETS BUT MAY BE WILLING TO OFFER HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE WHERE OTHERS ARE NOT. IT PROHIBITS INSURERS FROM DETECTING THE VALUE OF THE LAND VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IF THE HOMEOWNER CHOOSES TO REBUILD OR BUY A HOME SOMEWHERE ELSE. IT SAYS THAT A HOME. APRIL HOME IS LOST DURING A DECLARED DISASTER INSURERS MUST OFFER A 30% OF THE DWELLING COVERAGE LIMITS UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WITH NO ITEM IS ATION REQUIRED. REQUIRES INSURERS TO CONTINUE PAYING ADDITIONAL LIVING EXPENSES IF THE HOME IS REBUILT BUT NOT YET INHABITABLE TO DO IN AN INSUFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE. SUCH AS THE WATER SYSTEM AT THAT IS STILL DOWN FOR THE ELECTRIC RIP THAT HASN'T BEEN REPLACED AND THAT IS A REALITY IN MY DISTRICT. FINALLY AB THREE THREE ZERO ONE TWO REQUIRES THE FAIR PLAN TO CREATE A CLEARING HOUSE TO HELP INSURERS GET HOMEOWNERS OFF OF THE VERY EXPENSIVE FAIR PLAN. BUT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EYE BUT- THANK YOU MISTER WOULD. ARE THERE PERSONS WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. WHAT WAS THAT MARK. MEN SORRY YEAH I'VE I APOLOGIZE- I AM ACCEPTING PROPOSED COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M SORRY. THANK YOU WOULD. YES. HI YEAH LET'S GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PERSONS IN THE VIDEO ROOM TO. SUPPORT THE BILL ATTORNEY PERSONS THERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY COLLECTION IS HERE ON BEHALF OF IN SEARCH DURING SPECIAL KERR LARA IN CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT INSURANCE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS MEASURE YET- WE DO ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE BILL THERE'S ACTUALLY SEVERAL COMPONENTS. IN THIS MEASURE THAT- ARE ALSO CONTAINED IN THEM A SIMILAR BILL OF THAT COMMISSION A LOT OF SPONSORING- SENATE BILL EIGHT SEVENTY TWO AND SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL AND HEALTHCARE- IS THE BURDEN FOR THOSE CONSUMERS ATTEMPTING TO REBUILD THEIR HOME AND I SAID AFTER A CATASTROPHIC DISASTER. IN TO POTENTIAL OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE AS NOTED IN THE TRADING ELSE'S I DO WANT TO SAY AT LEAST FOR THE COMMITTEES- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- INFORMATION THAT. THE DEPARTMENT HAD PREVIOUSLY ISSUED EMERGENCY NOTICES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN FOR WILDFIRES THAT CALLED ON INSURANCE COMPANIES TO. EXPEDITE CLAIMS THAT WOULD MAKE IT INITIAL ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY ADVANCED DAILY PAYMENTS I REDUCE OVERLY ONEROUS ITEMS ATION OF THE HOMEOWNERS PERSONAL CONTENTS- DURING THOSE. A FEW- YEARS OF TIME AND WHEN WE HAD SENT OUT THOSE EMERGENCY NOTICES. VIRTUALLY ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES AGREES TO THOSE ACTIONS- THE REQUEST BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOR THEIR POLICY HOLDER SO WE DO SORT OF QUESTION WHY SOME IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY HAVE CONCERNS WITH THOSE ELEMENTS. THAT ARE INCORPORATED IN THIS BILL NOW WOULD YOU LOOK FOR WORKING WITH AUTHORS ON THIS- AND WHICH INCLUDES SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE- AND FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE CONTENTS COVERAGE PAYMENT AMOUNTS. TO ENSURE THE CURRENT FORMULA AS JACK THE BILL DOES NOT CREATE. AN INCENTIVE- CONSEQUENCES INEQUITIES AND OTHERWISE LIMIT THE BENEFIT OF OTHERWISE THIS.

MEMORABILIA IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS AND THOSE AREN'T COVERED UNDER THE STANDARD. OF POLICY UNDER THE FIRE INSURANCE THEY HAVE TO BE COVERED SEPARATELY BECAUSE THEY'RE INVESTMENT- SEPARATE FROM YOUR HOME- SO I. I SEE THE CLARITY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPRESS. WITHIN THE BILL HERE AND I APPRECIATE THAT. I APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY THE COMPONENT BECAUSE YOU AND I BOTH HAVE. DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SUFFERED GREATLY WITH ERRORS OF SUCH MAGNITUDE. NO ONE WOULD HAVE EVER HAPPENED- BUT THE REALITIES ARE. PEOPLE CAN'T MOVE BACK INTO THEIR HOME WHETHER THEY'RE ON A WATER SYSTEM SUCH AS- THE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE. THE LONG BEEN WANTING TO GET BACK. THERE OKAY HOMES IN THE BILL IF YOU DON'T WATER SYSTEM. CAPABLE OF STILLS PROVIDING A SECURE WATER SYSTEM WATER LEVEL- MANY PEOPLE WITH.

OR IN MCKINLEY- OR OR SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT WERE DEVASTATED AND THE CAMPFIRE- WITHOUT A PENALTY OF BEING HAVING TO.

WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY CHAMBER THANK YOU I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN HEAR ME. WE CAN YOU'VE ALREADY GOT MOTION AND SECOND IN. FOR YOUR BILL THE CHAIR RECOMMEND SUPPORT MISTER COOLEY REFERENCE YOUR BILL PREVIOUSLY. AND SO YOU'RE OFF TO A GREAT START PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS TODAY ARE PRETENDING MY BILL THE WILD VIRUS MODELING AND MEDICATION BELL AS WE KNOW ALL FIRE SEASON HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED AND IT'S NOW EIGHTY DAYS LONGER. THAN IT WAS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CLEARLY INCREASING THE RISK OF UNCONTROLLABLE SEVERE WILDFIRES THAT ENDANGER LIFE AND PROPERTY. IN ADDITION CLIMATE CHANGE AS WELL AS POPULATION GROWTH AND THE MOVEMENT TO THE WE HAVE AMPLE AMPLIFIED THE REST. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A- TO A TWENTY EIGHTEEN DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE REPORTS. ON THE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY A WILDFIRE COVERAGE PREMIUMS ARE INCREASING. AND MOST INSURERS DO NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. WILDFIRE MEDICATION CONDUCTED BY HOMEOWNERS. HOMEOWNER SHOULD BE ABLE TO REAP THE REWARDS OF THEIR WORK AND BETTER DATA OUT HOME PARTING IS NEEDED TO GET THEM DONE. THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE. THE DEPARTMENT FURTHER STATE THAT A CREDIBLE DATABASE FOR WELL KERR LOS EXPERIENCE IS NEEDED AND SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD CREATE A FRAMEWORK WHERE INSURERS OFFER MEDICATION PREMIUM CREDIT. FOR PROPERTY OWNERS THAT DO THEIR PART. THAT IS WHY SB TWO NINETY TWO IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. FIRST IT CONTAINS THE TRIGGER FOR DETERMINING WHEN. AND WHICH COUNTIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE AYE MAP PROGRAM. ELIGIBILITY IS TO ACCOUNT FOR POPULATION DENSITY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL COUNTY AND USES THE TWENTY NINETEEN THIRD FOR PAN NEW BUSINESS AS A TEMPLATE. MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR INITIAL AYE MAPPILA DEBILITY SB TWO NINETY TWO IS RETRACTED SO THE KILLINGS HIT HARDEST BY NON RENEWALS AND TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ARE INCLUDED. SECOND SB TWO NINETY THREE PARTY OFFICE OF PLANNING A RESEARCH TO EVALUATE THE AYE MAP PROGRAM WHICH AIMS TO GROW THE VOLUNTARY INSURANCE MARKET. IN THE COUNTY FOR THE VOLUNTARY MARKET HOUSEHOLD OUT. IN ORDER TO HOLD ENSURE THE COUNTABLE AT THREE TO NINETY TWO REQUIRES FULL PR IMPACT REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM. AND THIS BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL AND MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF TWO NINETY TWO. SB TWO NINETY TWO STATE THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO CONVENE A COMMISSION TO DEVELOP INDIVIDUAL HOLDING COMMUNITY HARDENING STANDARD. UNIFORMITY CATION STANDARDS WILL PREDICT WHAT. WILL BE CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE AYE MAP PROGRAM. AND TO HOMEOWNERS LOOKING FOR THE BILL'S COST EFFECTIVE FIRE SAFE RENOVATION AND DEVELOP THE DATA. NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ACTUALLY FOUND. MEDICATION DISCOUNTS FOR HOMEOWNERS. BY NINETEEN. SB TWO NINETY TWO WOULD ENCOURAGE COLLABORATION BETWEEN ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF CONSUMERS. THIS MEANS THAT TE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES HAS CONVENE AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDES EXPERT. FROM THE INDUSTRY AND THE UC SYSTEM TO DEVELOP STANDARDS BY USING MODELING AND REYES MAKING AND A PLAN TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC LAST MODEL. IF THIS DAMAGE THIS MODEL WILL BE BE A PUBLIC TOOL TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS. FOR MEMBERS STUDY DEVELOPING AN INCENTIVIZING HOMEOWNERS TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN ACTUALLY SOUND WILDFIRE MITIGATION MEASURES IT'S BASICALLY PRUDENT POLICY. WHERE THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES AND PREVENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUTURE LOSSES FROM OCCURRING I WANT TO ASSURE THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS ASKED THE BILL TO BAN FISTS SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THREE I. THINK YOU. THANK YOU MISSED RUBIO LET'S SERVE INVITE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC- WERE INTERESTED PARTIES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THERE IS AFTERNOON CHAIRS FROM THE VIDEO ROOM. YES SIR GOOD AFTERNOON SIR TAYLOR AGAIN AS YOU NOTED- I OFFER COMMENTS EARLIER THAT REFER TO BOTH AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN AND SB TWO NINETY TWO BECAUSE THEY THEY MUST BE ENACTED JOINTLY BECOME OPERATIVE AND SO WE VIEW THEM AS A PACKAGE SO I WON'T REITERATE THOSE COMMENTS. I WILL SAY AGAIN THAT HAVE SUPPORTS BOTH BILLS ALONG WITH THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AND THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION OF DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES AND AGAIN TO OUR CENTER RUBIO'S POINT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS COMPONENT DOES HAVE THE FRAMEWORK FOR YOU STAY COMMISSION. THAT HAS A BROAD GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT WOULD DEVELOP HOME COMMUNITY HARDING STANDARDS THAT CAN REDUCE LOSS TO DO WILD FIRES AND ESTABLISH A CENTRAL DATABASE OF HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFIC WALL VIRUS THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE FUTURE OF LOOKING THE FUTURE OF REDUCING RISK OF LOS THAT WILL ALSO HELP BRING DOWN- INSURANCE. I IT ALSO I AND AGAIN THE REFERENCE THIS THE REPORT THE TO BUILD REPORT THE OFFICE PLANNING AND THAT WITH AN THE EFFECT OF I'M NOT. AT PROVIDING REQUEST COVERAGE AT LOWER COST CALIFORNIA FAIR ACCESS TO INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS OF FAIR PLAY. AND MODERN CHURCH PROGRESS ON THEIR COMMITTEE. TO OFFER INSURANCE POLICIES IN THOSE WILDFIRE FROM COMMUNITIES SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMPANION PIECE TO TWENTY ONE SIXTY SEVEN. THANK YOU SIR OTHER FOLKS IN THE VIDEO ROOM WISHING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR. THE PRIME NUMBER FROM THE SENATE INSURANCE COMMITTEE HERE TO HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR.

SECONDLY SENATE BILL TWO NINE TO CIRCUMVENT THE AUTHORITY OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND EXISTING DEPARTMENTS REGULATIONS FOR REGULATING THE USE OF COMPLEX. TO TACITLY MODELS WHEN PROJECTED FUTURE LOSSES. THIRDLY SENATE BILL TWO NINE TWO PERMITS THE USE OF EXPIRED RATES. THE INSURANCE QUESTIONS EXISTING NETWORK PROHIBITS EXCESSIVE AN ADEQUATE OR UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY RATES AND DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH RATES TO REMAIN IN EFFECT HOWEVER THIS BILL WOULD EXPRESSLY PROVIDING INSURER MAY CONTINUE TO USE OLD ACTUALLY UNSOUND INSURANCE MARKET ACTION PLAN GRADES EVEN AFTER AND I'M UP AS A NATION IT IS EXPIRED. FOR BOTH INSURED AND RENEWED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE POLICY. ALL THIS BILL DIRECTS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONALLY SPECIFIC COMMITTEE HARDENING STANDARDS AND HOME HARDEN STANDARDS THROUGH A STATEWIDE COMMISSION- WE- STATEWIDE STANDARDS CAN BE ACTUALLY BE A BENEFIT- WHICH THEY JUST. CAN'T RELATE TO HIMSELF THIS BILL EMBRACES THE NEW RATE MAKING PROCESS THAT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CONSUMERS INSURANCE PROGRAMS OVER TIME. WHILE THE SAME TIME WE CAN INCLUDES YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE RECORD MAKING PROCESS.

THANK YOU THIS IS KERA CROSSED WITH A AYE OUR WORLDWIDE WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF A MAN POSITION ON THE BILL WE LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING WITH THE AUTHOR AND NONE IS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE A PATH TO DO MOBILE MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR USE BY INSURERS AND THE PUBLIC MORE ACCURATELY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS OF LOS. I DIDN'T TO SAY THAT CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY IS PERMITTED TO USE CATASTROPHE MODEL IN THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY MENTIONED WHAT APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND ALSO IN FLORIDA AFTER HURRICANE- CATCHER MODELS ARE WIDELY USED AND RECOGNIZED AS AN APPROPRIATE- USED TO ATTACK BRETT- AND THEY ARE APPROVED- BY SEPARATE COMMISSION AND THE STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CROSS. IS MORE SELECT THE RIVER MOTION SECOND OTHER OTHER. FOLKS SPEAKING AGAINST THE BILL. TO THE MODERATOR OTHER IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN LINE. GET THIRTY TO HAVE ONE PERSON IN LINE- WILL GO TO ONE NUMBER FIFTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. SENATOR RUBIO AND MEMBERS ROBERT WHO WELL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB TWO ONE TWO. FOR WELL ORAL ARE. MY PHONE LINE IS WORKING JUST FINE. I'LL I'LL BE MORE PROOF THAT MR MATIC WAS. STILL UNFORTUNATELY THE WORLD'S IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT IS SAFE CALIFORNIA BILLIONS OF HAPPY DECADES. INDICATED THAT THE TWO NINETY TWO FIRST OF THE COMMISSION AND THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE CREATED BY THIS BILL ARE DESIGNED IN SUCH A MANNER SO AS TO IGNORE AND SHUT OUT THE POLICE'S OF CONSUMERS. DESPITE ASSERTIONS CHUCK MADE BY THE CHURCH TO THE STREET A FEW MOMENTS AGO THERE'S NO BLOCK GROUP. OF STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED NO CONSUMER POLICY HOLDER REPRESENTATIVE SERVE ON EITHER OF THE COMMISSION OR THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WHICH TO ME IS VERY. SECOND AT TWO NINETY TWO APPEARS TO. TISSUE FROM. MODELS USED BY COMPANIES. DURING THAT THE REGULATOR CAN AND- THE BLACK BOX MODEL THEM IF YOU WILL USE BY INSURERS AND THE VENDORS WHO THEY HIRE TO HELP THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENT AND FAIR WAY MAKING PROCESS. AT BEST A GENEROUS INTERPRETATION IS THAT THE BILL IS EXTREME WORKING ON THIS POINT. THIS IS RELEVANT TO SB TWO NINETY TWO BECAUSE REGULATED INDUSTRIES DESIRE WHAT IS KNOWN AS REGULATORY CAPTURE. WHEREBY THE REGULATED INDUSTRY ESSENTIALLY PROHIBITS THE REGULATOR FROM EFFECTIVELY DOING THEIR JOB AND THE REGULATOR IS PERPETUALLY FIVE STEPS BEHIND THE LATEST INDUSTRY MODEL OR STANDARD. AND CONSUMER SUFFERS IN THE MEANTIME. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN EFFECTIVE CONSUMER FOCUSED INSURANCE INDUSTRY REGULATION. NOW IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE MOMENT TO LET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DICTATE HOW. THEY CAN BE REGULATEDTHE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY URGES NO GO ON SB TWO NINETY TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU SIR. ARE THERE ANY OTHER FOLKS IN THE TELEPHONE Q. SIR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. I WANT TO POINT OUT JUST A COUPLE. OF ITEMS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY NOT HAVE NOTICED IN THE CORRESPONDENCE WE RECEIVED. IN A FEATURE OF THE BILL WHICH I THINK IS VERY HELPFUL THE FUTURE OF THE BILL. REQUIRES THE STATE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO ISSUE WHEN ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT THAT ANALYZES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. AT PROVIDING MORE ROBUST COVERAGE AT LOWER COST. THEN THE FAIR PLAN. AND MONITORS THE INSURERS PROGRESS ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO OFFER HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE POLICIES IN A WILDFIRE FROM COMMUNITY SO THERE WILL BE AN ASSESSMENT MADE- THE LEAST MEASURES TWO OF THOSE. FEATURES THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT MISTER WOOD HAD ON MY BILL. SECONDLY I THINK IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THEY LIKE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERSIGHT AND ADVISORY GROUPS TO WORK THROUGH THE COMPLICATED DETAILS OF WILD FIRE RISK MITIGATION AND INCENTIVES. THEY ALSO LIKE THE PUBLIC MODELING. WITH THE PUBLIC DATABASE OF HOUSING AND WILD FIRE MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. AND SO I THINK THAT'S NOT WORTHY THAT TO FOX WHOSE FOCUS IS FIRE PROTECTION THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA THEY SUPPORT THIS BILL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MS RUBIO ON HER BILL MISTER BIGELOW. GOING ON THAT SAME LINE MAYBE FOR FROM THE AUTHOR WITH YOU GET A LITTLE CLARIFICATION ON CAL FIRE HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A SERIES OF- OF ITS OWN WE BUILDING CODES WHICH INCLUDES COMPLEX MODELING AND LOOKING AT HIGH HAZARD SAFETY AREAS- ZONES AND PARCELS- WITHIN THOSE ZONES. THE QUESTION REALLY IS HOW WILL THIS BILL A LINE WITH THEIR WORK. AND THE APPROPRIATE PRODUCTS BEING USED BY THE WILLIE AND ENSURE THAT THE COMMISSION ISN'T. JUST DUPLICATING- ANY OF THEIR ACTIONS MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ADDRESS THAT. WELL THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO ALSO SPOKE ON THE PHONE I HEARD THE CONCERNS AND I KNOW THAT THAT. WE'RE FACING VERY DIFFERENT TIMES AS WE KNOW THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING. THE WORST FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD AND SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO STATE FOR THE RECORD IS. DUE TO COVET NINETEEN IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO CONNECT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS BUT I CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS SO I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. UNTIL WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT TO PICK IT UP AND- THIS IS MORE OF A LONG TERM TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE- TRY TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS BETTER OPTIONS AND THAT THEIR COVER ITSELF. RIGHT NOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MINIMIZE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING. AND SO THAT'S AS BEST AS I CAN ANSWER IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAPPY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE I. DO AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND MANY OF US HERE OF SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE'VE SEEN AND WITNESSED OVER AND OVER. A DUPLICATION OF ACTIONS THAT OCCURRED AT. A COMPOUND IN BILLS THE COSTS. FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THE MOST SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR- DIRECTNESS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. HOW HOW IT'S DIFFICULT NOW TO. GET IN TOUCH WITH EVERYONE AND TRY TO GET ALL THESE ANSWERS AS BEST YOU CAN- OFFERED ON A HEARING LIKE TODAY BUT- PLEASE TAKE A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION TO THAT SO WE DON'T HAVE DUPLICATION OF ACTION. AND COMPOUNDING OF COSTS FOR THEIR PEOPLE I DO APPRECIATE YOUR BILL I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING IN I THINK A GOOD DIRECTION. AND LOOK FOR TO SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER WHAT IS A QUESTION MISS CALM WATER HAS QUESTION. AND MR BUT ACTUALLY MISTER VOEPEL HAD IS MIKE UP FIRST GO AHEAD SIR YES I SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S A GREAT BILL WE NEEDED- AND HERE'S WHY. MANY CARRIERS USE THE I- SO RADIANT SYSTEM FOR FIRE HAZARD. THE RATING SYSTEM GOES FROM ONE TO TEN. PARADISE CALIFORNIA WAS RAIDED A TWO SLASH TWO ACTS IT IS STILL RATED AT TWO SLASH TWO X. I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW I ALSO CAME UP WITH THAT WHEN I WAS MAYOR OF MY CITY. MY FIRE CHIEF TOOK GREAT PRIDE IN GETTING THE LOWEST ISO RATING POSSIBLE AND PART OF THE FORMULA THERE IS YOUR FIRE DEPARTMENT IT IS YOUR FIRE HYDRANTS EXCEPT YEAH. I LOOK AT THIS STUDY AS BEING CRITICALLY NEEDED. BECAUSE NOT JUST AYE SO BUT MANY CARRIERS AND I WON'T NAME ON. DO NOT USE I SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SYSTEM FOR DOING FIRE RISK. AND THEY CAN BASICALLY MAKE UP THEIR OWN RULES. I ALSO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT INCLUDES THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND EMERGENCY SERVICES OFFICE. AS JOINT CHAIR TO ME THAT'S A GREAT STRUCTURE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS AND I HOPE TO SEE IT WORK AND I BELIEVE IT WILL HELP. CORRECT SOME OF THE- DANGEROUS PRACTICES. IN THE HIGH FIRE WRIST AREAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. MISS PROM LONGER. THANK YOU MISTER I JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE LETTERS OF OPPOSITION THAT THIS WOULD IN FACT INCREASE RATES. THAT'S MY QUESTION WHAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK I HEARD ON T. V. SO ONE OF THE SPEAKERS WAS TALKING ABOUT PROP ONE ALL THREE AND I THINK IT WAS THE SHARED RIGHT NOW- AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO EXPRESS THAT THE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT HE GOT UP FROM CONSUMERS. AT EVERY LEVEL OF CONVERSATION THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY REVIEW THE MODEL AND THAT MAKE SURE THAT HE BACKS IT IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION AND PROTECTS CONSUMERS WITH NOT SOMETHING WE'RE JUST GONNA CREATING GOAL FOR WEIGHT IT'S GONNA HAVE PROFESSIONAL INPUT- STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND CONSUMER INPUT WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT ALL THAT IS PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO. AREN'T IS TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR CONSUMERS NOT MAKE IT WORK SO WE WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT THAT. MR WOULD EUROPE. THANK YOU- I JUST WANNA SAY I INTEND TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODA BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- I WAS SURPRISED THIS WE RESET YOUR STAFF AND I ASKED THEM- FOR THE LISTING COUNTIES THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS I WAS SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED QUITE FRANKLY THIS COUNTY WHERE I LIVE- IS NOT ON THE LIST- BUT SEE WE HAD- I DON'T KNOW THIRTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN- TO THAT THE NINETEEN WE HAVE THE LARGEST. FIRE BY ACREAGE. IN THE THREE OF THE COUNTY. AND YET SOMEHOW. IT DOESN'T QUALIFY HERE. FOR THIS SO- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT QUITE FRANKLY COUPLE THE OTHER COUNT AS A REPRESENT DO BUT- BUT- I'M YOU KNOW I'M I WANT TO LOOK AT THIS FURTHER AND SEE- YOU KNOW WHAT WAY WHY THIS I AND WHAT THE EXPLANATION AS- I AM CONCERNED THERE ARE A MILLION HOMES NOW THAT HAVE- HAD REYES FROZEN. BY INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LARA AND I'M I AM WONDERING- QUITE FRANKLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THAT FREEZE COMES OFF AND I MY INSTINCT IS THAT THOSE RATES ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND THAT THAT CONCERNS ME THAT CONCERNS ME AS WELL SOME OF THE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BUT I'M IN A RESERVE THE RIGHT TO- NOT SUPPORTED ON THE FLOOR IF I DON'T MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED. AND I WOULD JUST SAY WITH RESPECT TO THE CHAIRS BILL I SUPPOSE SUPPORT THAT BILL AND I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO- RECONSIDER THAT ON THE FLOOR I AM STILL CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO A SPIKE IN AND RATES- THAT THAT WOULD MAKE IT- YOU KNOW I FIND ACCEPTABLE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY INSTINCT ORDERS MY INSTINCT- THE ONLY ONE DO YOU HAVE ANY ANSWERING TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THAT THAT RATE FREEZE AB COME HAPPENS. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOUR AREA DESERVES AS MUCH CARE AS IT SB ENTIRE CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S A SPECIFIC REASON WHY THAT HAPPENED AND I HAVE ONE OF MY STAFF MEMBERS THAT WE CAN DEFERRED TO HAND YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE COUNTY WITH LEFT OUT AND I HAVE TO DO WITH THE PREVIOUS BILL AND STILL TRYING TO PIECE ON. A LATE. MR SOME MEMBER IN RESPONSE TO YOUR- IT IS QUITE SURPRISING- INITIALLY THAT. THE COUNTY OF SADDAM WOULD BE OFF THE LIST BUT IT IS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS FOR KIND O ONE MAIN REASON. THAT IS THAT SB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR PROVIDES PROTECTION. FOR ZIP CODES THAT WERE A STATE OF EMERGENCY SO. FOR THE LAST- SOCIALLY FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN TO DEVASTATING FIRES THAT HAVE ALLOWED- THE PEOPLE IN CINEMA TO KEEP THEIR INSURANCE WHEREAS OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. OF THE DO NOT HAVE THIS PROTECTION HAVE BEEN NON RENEWED. AND I'VE GONE INTO THE FAIR PLAN. SO I BELIEVE THAT IN THE FUTURE THAT IF THOSE PROTECTIONS EXPIRE. THAT INSURERS WILL AGAIN. COMMIT TO DO MORE LAW WE WILL IN YOUR AREA AND OTHER AREAS. AND ASK THOSE HOMEOWNERS- RELY ON FAIR PLAN FOR THEIR INSURANCE- THE SYSTEM SET UP WILL CAPTURE THAT INFORMATION. AND QUALIFY THE COUNTY- WHEN IT REACHES EXCUSE ME THE THRESHOLD. THANK YOU. SO IF I UNDERSTAND IT IT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY ONCE WAS PROTECTIONS GO WAY THAT MY COUNTY WILL NOW BE ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS IS AT THAT FAIR. THE CURRENT PROTECTIONS BASED ON ZIP CODES THAT WHICH IS THAT SUCH A WHAT YOU'VE SAID. OKAY YEAH THE CURRENT PROTECTIONS BASED ON ZIP CODE. ROLL ALLOW LOOKS IN ON THE COUNTY TO NOT DEAL WITH AS MANY ON RULES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE INSURERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO NON RENEW THEIR HOMEOWNER'S BUT IT'S PRETTY WELL CORRELATED THAT WOULD NOT RULES EXCEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THEIR PLAN WILL HAVE A SEARCH- IN THAT AREA BECAUSE THE OTHER INSURERS ARE AT THEIR CONCENTRATION OF THAT AND NOT ABLE TO WRITE A MORE POLICY THIS TYPE OF MARKET CONTRACTION LOCALLY IS WHAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND- EVALUATE IN REAL TIME- ON AN ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN ORDER TO- PROVIDE- YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE SEVERAL DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE NOW. THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND I AM NOT PROGRAM YOU ASSUMING THAT THERE ARE MORE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AND MORE NOT RULES. OKAY THAT WAS THE FIRST WAS WITH THE SECOND QUESTION WAS THE MILLION HOMES THAT HAVE HAD THEIR RATES FROZEN. WHAT WE EXPECT WHEN THAT WENT UP WHEN THAT FREEZE ENDS WHICH I BELIEVE WILL HAPPEN LATER THIS YEAR. IF I'M NOT CORRECT I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT'S GOING TO END. BUT I GUESS THAT'S UP TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER- WHEN THAT HAPPENS BUT- I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THE RATES ARE GOING TO GO OUT. WHEN THAT HAPPENS SO. AND IT'S A VALID CONCERN AND AS I MENTIONED AGAIN THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER A IS GOING TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. SO THERE IS PROTECTION IN THAT RESPECT AND AS BRIAN MENTIONED OP. I TO YOUR OHER QUESTION RIGHT NW BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THAT PROTECTION- WITH WHAT ANY BE. IT WASN'T INCLUDED BUT ONCE IT'S UP. THIRTY BASED ON THE NON RENEWAL AND A FAIR CAN SEARCH. IT WILL TRIGGER. THE AYE MAP PROTECTION FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO QUESTION THE ELIGIBILITY OF A COUNTY. AND IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN LINE NOW OF THE TO. THAT ARE IN EFFECT BUT IN THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT. AT THE CINEMA COUNTY FOR INSTANCE MAY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE BUT I FOR ONE WILL BE WATCHING THAT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- MATTER. AND WE WANT THIS TO WORK WHEREVER IT'S NEEDED I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL LET'S KEEP OUR EYE ON THE BALL THERE AND. I RESPECT THE SENATE STAFFER IN HIS- HIS REASONING ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO WANT THIS TO WORK FOR HOMEOWNERS IN FIRE RISK AREAS AT SOME POINT SO THE ELIGIBILITY BY ANY COUNTY IS A IS AN IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT POINT. A BIG HANK YOU TO OPT ANY COMMENT AGAIN- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- WHAT I'M HEARING THOUGH IS THAT. THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED CATASTROPHIC LOSSES ONCE THE PROTECTION OF THE ZIP CODE PROTECTION HAPPENS THEY'RE GONNA GET TO SUFFER AGAIN. BEFORE THEY GET TO QUALIFY POTENTIALLY FOR THIS PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS ME. YEAH AND- I THINK WE I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS AND I'LL BE OPPORTUNITIES TO FINE TUNE IT. AND CERTAINLY THE THRUST O THE BILL IS SOMETHING THAT I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND- I'M READ RECOMMENDING IN FAVOR OF IT BUT THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH. YEAH I WANTED A SHERMAN AT HIM AS WELL SORRY FAMILY MEMBER THAT I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS AND AGAIN THE LIMITATION OF OUR BEING IN THE BUILDING AND HAVING HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS- BUT SOME LIMITATIONS BUT I WILL SIT DOWN WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT WE TACKLE YOUR PARTICULAR SHIRT. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT OUT OF THE PROCESS. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO I THINK WE'VE- WE'VE HEARD ALL THE COMMENTS THAT TO. THAT WERE MEANT TO BE MADE.
