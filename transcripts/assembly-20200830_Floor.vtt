EARLY TWENTIES. AND THE REASON

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:00.655
WHY IS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:02.690
OF US LIKE THAT. BECAUSE WE

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.058

CERTAIN TIES ARE OLDER THAN US.

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:15.203
OR THAT WE WERE QUALIFIED. OR

01:31:15.269 --> 01:31:15.770
THAT OUR JUDGMENT SHOULD BE

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:17.638
