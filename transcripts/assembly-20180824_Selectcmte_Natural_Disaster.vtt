WATER THAT WAS THE RANGE OF

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:34.078
DEVICES THAT YOU'RE UTILIZING

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.980
HOW DO YOU MANAGE ALL OF THOSE

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:36.614
DEVICES AND THEN HOW DO YOU ALSO

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:37.682
MAY.

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:39.383
ALL OF THE PLANS THAT EACH

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:44.522
DEVICE MUST BE ON YOU ARE TALK.

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.490
* ABOUT THE CONTRACTS SURE --

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:49.994
SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE --

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:50.661
FOR OUR DEPARTMENT WERE NOT ONLY

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.229
LARGE TO PAY FOR IT OR ABOUT

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:54.465
FIFTEEN STATION THAT'S A WERE

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:55.332
MEDIUM SIZE ORGANIZATION.

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:56.600
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEVICES

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:57.902
THAT ARE KIND CONNECTED YOU'RE

00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:58.936
STILL LOOKING AT I THINK

00:38:59.003 --> 00:38:59.870
SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF OVER

00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:02.006
THREE HUNDRED DEVICES --

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.308
AND THAT INCLUDES HOT SPOTS ON

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:07.812
IPADS PHONE CELLULAR PHONES --

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:09.513
ROUTERS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.082
APPARATUS HAS A CREEL POINT THE

00:39:11.148 --> 00:39:14.618
VICE WHICH HOLDS THE SIM CARDS.

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.487
AND CREEKS THAT WIFI HOTSPOT

00:39:16.554 --> 00:39:18.556
OVER OUR VEHICLES --

00:39:18.622 --> 00:39:19.423
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.192
REALIZE IS SOMETHING SIMPLE AS A

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:22.827
PATIENT CARE REPORT DURING AN

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:24.295
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CALL?

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:25.863
BACK IT'S UPLOADED THROUGH THAT

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:27.765
SYSTEM AND SENT TO THE HOSPITAL

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.567
AUTOMATICALLY OVER WIRELESS.

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.802
ON THERE'S A LOT OF USES FOR

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.304
WIRELESS IN THE FIRE SERVICE WE

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.839
HAVE QUITE A FEW DEVICES THAT

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.340
ARE ALL CONNECTED WE DO HAVE AN

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:38.142
INTERNAL IT STAFF THAT MANAGES

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.844
THAT WORKS DIRECTLY WITH OUR

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:40.111
ACCOUNT.

00:39:40.177 --> 00:39:42.079
REPRESENTATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:43.047
WE MANAGE THAT PLAN

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:45.216
APPROPRIATELY.

00:39:45.282 --> 00:39:46.917
SO FOR ALL THESE DEVICES THEY

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.420
COULD BE SITTING IDLE.

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.455
NOT USING DATA.

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.190
AND TELL THE EVENTS THAT OCCUR

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:56.393
IS THAT YOU NEED THAT DATA --

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.896
YOU HOW HOW DO YOU.

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:00.464
JACKSON OR PLANNED.

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:01.632
FOR WHAT SERVICE WOULD BE

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.434
REQUIRED IN A CIRCUMSTANCE LIKE

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:05.102
THAT IS EFFICIENT IS OUR

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:06.103
DIFFERENT WAY TO DO IT THAT

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.572
MIGHT BE MORE RESPONSIVE.

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.107
TO YOUR AGENCIES NEEDS AND THE

00:40:10.174 --> 00:40:12.543
REAL USE OF THIS EQUIPMENT.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.811
BUT THAT THAT'S A REALLY GREAT

00:40:13.878 --> 00:40:16.647
QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT THE

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:18.215
ON THE THING ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY

00:40:18.282 --> 00:40:19.683
IS IT IS.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.919
VERY DIFFICULT AS HARD AS WE TRY

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:23.788
AND WE ANALYZE THE DATA TO

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:24.388
PREDICT WHEN EVENTS ARE GONNA

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:25.756
HAPPEN.

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.124
WHETHER BE A SMALL DENT WHERE

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.226
THERE BE A LARGE EVENT.

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:30.795
SO THERE ARE TIMES THAT YOU HAVE

00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:32.029
DOWNTIME THERE ARE TIMES THAT

00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.765
AND YOU HAVE A HUGE SPIKES IN

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:37.835
YOUR NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO DATA.

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.103
BUT WE HAVE A SET OF PLANS ARE

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.472
REALLY BASED --

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:44.408
FOR AGENCIES OR CONSUMERS.

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.143
THAT CAN PLAN OUT.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.878
THEIR DATA NEED BASED ON

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:50.781
HISTORICAL USAGE MONTH BY MONTH.

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:51.415
THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH PUBLIC

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:52.983
SAFETY.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.451
SO YOU HAVE TO FIND A BALANCE

00:40:54.518 --> 00:40:55.653
YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH YOUR

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:58.022
ACCOUNT MATTER WHEN WE ARE A

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.456
MEDIUM SIZED PERMIT WE DO NOT

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:01.192
HAVE UNLIMITED FUNDS.

00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:02.359
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:03.994
WHEN WE SELECT THE PLAN IT MEETS

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:05.529
OUR NEEDS.

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:08.132
BUT IT ALSO IS NOT A PLAN THAT

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:09.767
IS SO EXPENSIVE IT COMES AT A

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.468
COST OF STAFFING.

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:12.703
AND WE'RE ALL CONSTANTLY TRYING

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.605
TO FIND THAT BALANCE.

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:15.873
WHEN WORKING WITH THESE PLANTS

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.007
THAT REALLY ARE BASED TOWARDS

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:19.076
CONSUMERS?

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.345
VERSES THE ALONG.

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:21.912
THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF PUBLIC

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:25.182
SAFETY.

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.317
YOU MAKE A REALLY GOOD POINT

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.718
ABOUT DOWN SEEN.

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:29.486
THESE PLANS WITH.

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.922
THE COST OF ANOTHER FIREFIGHTER.

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:32.990
HE'S ABLE TO PROTECT THE

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:34.291
COMMUNITY AS WELL AND THE

00:41:34.358 --> 00:41:36.026
BUDGETARY.

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.628
PRESSURES THAT THAT YOU'RE UNDER.

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:38.529
DO YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE

00:41:38.596 --> 00:41:39.997
SERVICE PROVIDER.

YOUR SECTOR IS THEN LOOKING AT

A FIRE IN THE HEART OF SANTA

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.432
IT IS.

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:03.834
AND CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE ACCESS

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.335
BUT WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING ARE

00:45:05.402 --> 00:45:06.737
PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE ARE

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:09.273

FAMILIES AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE

00:45:09.973 --> 00:45:10.507
ABLE.

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:11.608
TO CONTACT HER FAMILY AS

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:13.077
CRITICAL AS WELL SO I CAN SPEAK

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.878
ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.480
BECAUSE I PERSONALLY LED THE

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.915
STRIKE TEAMS --

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:20.784
BUT AS FAR AS OTHER AGENCIES

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:21.085
[inaudible]

00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.319
PHONE.

00:45:22.386 --> 00:45:22.920
EXPERIENCE THROTTLING I CAN'T

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:25.155
SPEAK TO THAT.

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.623
AND MADAM CHAIR WAS --

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.393

THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX IN JULY

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:38.602
[inaudible] TWENTY EIGHTEEN I

00:45:38.669 --> 00:45:43.507
THINK YOU AND I LESS THAN TWENTY

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.442
FOUR HOURS AGO.

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.644
THAT WE SAW THAT --

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:48.912
THE PROVIDER THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:51.415
ABOUT SIDE.

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:53.283
MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS TO

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.252
THEIR PROGRAM OVERALL THAT WOULD

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:59.123
TRY -- TO

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:00.691
ENSURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:02.593
AGAIN FROM YOUR PRINT WHAT ARE

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:04.995
YOUR THOUGHTS AND REACTIONS --

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:06.797
IN ENTER AND I AM AND I DON'T

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.266
KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TO

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:11.001
SEE -- BAIL

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.069
WHAT THEY WILL BE DOING MOVING

00:46:12.136 --> 00:46:13.737
FORWARD I WANT TO SPEAK FOR THEM

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.506
BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS --

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:16.840
IN IN TERMS OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:19.977
REACTIONS I TO THEIR PROPOSED

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.845
PLAN MOVING FORWARD.

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.114
SO I HAVE NOT SEEN THEIR

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:26.750
PROPOSED PLAN --

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:27.351
BUT I WILL SAY THIS PERSONALLY

00:46:27.417 --> 00:46:29.753
OWNED.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.088
WITH MY STAFF THEY KNOW I'D

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:32.890
RATHER KEEP MY HEAD DOWN WORK

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:36.226
HARD DIDN'T SPEAK PUBLICLY.

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:36.827
HOUSE SPEAKER TO MY WIFE LAST

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:37.628
NIGHT.

00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:38.896
AND SHE SAID IF THIS MAKES A

00:46:38.962 --> 00:46:40.264
DIFFERENCE FOR THE FIRE SERVICE

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.798
MOVING FORWARD.

00:46:41.865 --> 00:46:42.866
YOU NEED TO BE IN THERE BE

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:44.468
STRONG.

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:46.770
AND PUSH FOR CHANGE SO THAT THIS

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.205
DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANY OTHER

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:50.807
FIRE SERVICE PROVIDER.

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:53.043
AND THAT RESONATED WITH ME.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.411
I'VE REALLY TRULY HOPE THAT WHAT

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:55.879
COMES OUT OF THIS IS THAT A

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.281
GREATER PARTNERSHIP IN MOVING

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:58.916
FORWARD THAT THIS DOES NOT

00:46:58.982 --> 00:46:59.750
HAPPEN AGAIN TO ANY OTHER PUBLIC

00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:03.120
HE'S.

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:04.588
AND I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:06.223
I THINK USED UP THE WORD

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:07.257
PARTNERSHIP --

00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:08.892
I THINK HAD TO GUESS MY GUESS IS

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.727
THAT ALL OF THOSE AND THAT ARE

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.963
SITTING ON THIS DIETS WOULD WANT

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.531
THE SAME THING THAT THIS IS IT

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:16.099
I'M SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:17.034
HAPPEN.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.569
I'M AGAIN I KNOW THAT EVERY

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.971
MINUTES I HAVING LIVED.

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:22.673
THE THOMAS WILDFIRE EVERY SECOND

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:25.108
AND MINUTE MEANT SOMETHING TO US --

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:27.244
AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:31.582
I COMING HERE AND SHARING THAT

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.985
WITH US AND MY FINAL QUESTION IS.

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:36.753
THINKING NOW NOT JUST RELATED TO

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.689
THIS INCIDENT --

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:39.723
BUT REFLECTING ON THAT WORD

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.525
PARTNERSHIP.

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:43.727
ARE THERE ANY OTHER AGENCIES ARE

00:47:43.794 --> 00:47:45.262
INDUSTRIES THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:47.130
THINKING ABOUT PARTNERING WITH

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.466
TO IDENTIFY.

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:52.102
A BIG PROBLEM A COMMON PROBLEM

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:54.271
AND OUTSIDE OF JUST THE SPACE IS

00:47:54.338 --> 00:47:55.706
THERE SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOUR

00:47:55.772 --> 00:47:58.609
SCENE AND THAT IS AN ISSUE TO

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:00.811
OUR PUBLIC SAFETY IN A WAY --

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:01.378
THAT SHOULD WE SHOULD THINK

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:02.846
ABOUT NOW --

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.382
AND AND AND MAYBE NOT WHEN WE WE

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.351
WE SEE A PROBLEM.

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.253
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:11.154
ESPECIALLY WITH OF THE LARGE

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.322
AMOUNT OF FIRES WE'VE HAD OVER

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:14.424
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:17.594
AND THERE'S OPPORTUNITY EXISTS.

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:18.729
IF YOU HAD A FIRE IN YOUR

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:20.230
JURISDICTION YOU MAY HAVE LOST A

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.466
SOUL FLIGHT.

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:23.000
A AND THEY ARE REBUILDING

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.901
SULFITES.

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:26.036
I THINK HARDENING OF OUR

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.604
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:28.605
PROTECT THE CELL SITE WHATEVER

00:48:28.672 --> 00:48:29.606
THE PROPRIETOR SHOULD BE A

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:33.110
PRIORITY SO ACCESS OWNED.

00:48:33.176 --> 00:48:36.780
CAN BE AVAILABLE IS ROBUST --

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.882
THERE IS BACKUP SYSTEMS OUR

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.217
GENERATOR SYSTEMS TO KEEP THEM

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.852
UP AND RUNNING THERE'S  LOT OF

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.553
INFRASTRUCTURE HARDENING THAT WE

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.155
CAN DO TO SUPPORT THE OVERALL

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:46.623
SYSTEM.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.825
AND NOT JUST FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:49.726
SO REPUBLICAN ACTUALLY GET THE

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:51.495
MESSAGE.

00:48:51.561 --> 00:48:52.529
THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PUT OUT TO

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.131
THEM TO CRITICAL INFORMATION

00:48:54.197 --> 00:48:54.998
THEY NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.900
AS WELL.

00:48:56.967 --> 00:48:58.802
THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY THE ONE

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:00.203
STRONG RECOMMENDATION I WOULD

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.272
HAVE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN.

00:49:02.339 --> 00:49:02.839
MAKE SURE WE DON'T MISS THE

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:04.308
OPPORTUNITY.

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:06.710
AS WE REBUILD A LOT OF THE SITES

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.879
TO HARDEN THEM.

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:10.781
AND I THINK AS THOSE ARE

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.082
POWERFUL COMMENTS RIGHT NOT

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:13.684
MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.519
BETTER -- TO

00:49:15.585 --> 00:49:17.387
REBUILD AND DO WHATEVER IS

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:19.122
NEEDED I'M TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:20.724
PARTNERSHIP IS STRONG AND

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.493
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIANS

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.696
WANT AND NEED I'M PARTICULARLY

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:26.930
IN EMERGENCY SERVICES.

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:31.868
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. TWO

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:33.170
OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS AT

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.271
THIS POINT MISS AMERICA HAVE

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:36.373
JUST SEVERAL BASIC QUESTION I'M

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.841
ASKED THE OTHERS AS WELL

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:38.141
[inaudible]

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:40.577
IN RETROSPECT SINCE YOU HAD THE

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:41.878
INITIAL.

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.413
THROTTLING IN DECEMBER.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:43.914
BUT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.383
DIFFERENT.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.319
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION WE

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:50.153
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.254
DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENT GIVEN

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:52.222
THE RESPONSE THAT WE INITIALLY

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:54.324
RECEIVED.

00:49:54.391 --> 00:49:55.192
THE RESPONSE WE INITIALLY

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:56.626
RECEIVED RACKET DECEMBER WAS

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:57.828
POSITIVE IT WAS HANDLED WITHIN

00:49:57.894 --> 00:49:59.763
TWENTY MINUTES --

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.498
WE BEGAN THEN LOOKING AT

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:03.667
REDUNDANT SYSTEMS ON TO FURTHER

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:05.402
STRENGTHEN OUR FLEET.

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.937
AND BECAUSE WE HAD STARTED THAT

00:50:07.003 --> 00:50:08.205
WORK WE WERE ABLE TO OVERNIGHT

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.107
SHIP ANOTHER DEVICE WE ARE

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.274
LOOKING INTO --

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:13.143
I THINK THAT.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.045
FORESIGHT BY MY STAFF AT THAT

00:50:15.112 --> 00:50:17.280
TIME LED TO THE SUCCESSFUL

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:19.015
RECOVERY.

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:22.419
ADVOCACY NO COMPLEX.

00:50:22.486 --> 00:50:23.854
WOULD YOU HAVE ELEVATED THAT THE

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.022
YOUR CONCERN AND THE DECEMBER

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:27.424
AREA TO A TIME FRAME.

00:50:27.491 --> 00:50:30.427
UP TO MANAGEMENT OF THE PROVIDER

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:30.727
[inaudible]

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.496
HOME.

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:33.497
AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT WE DID

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:34.865
BECAUSE WE ARE WORKING THROUGH

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.600
OUR MAJOR ACCOUNTS --

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:37.968
MANAGER --

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.236
AT THAT TIME.

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:40.971
AND AGAIN WE WERE WORKING

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:42.906
TOWARDS A SOLUTION.

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:45.509
BASED ON OUR NEEDS.

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.910
AND BRING INDEED REDUNDANT

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:49.012
PROVIDERS WAS RECOGNIZED BY OUR

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:51.515
STAFF AS A AS A CRITICAL NEED

00:50:51.581 --> 00:50:52.749
AND WE BEGIN IMMEDIATELY WORKING

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:54.184
ON THAT.

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:57.320
AS THE REPRESENTATIVE WITH

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:59.256
AMONGST A COUPLE OF YEARS WE

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:00.557
HAVE THE MIND OF SEEING A FIRE

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.692
I'VE HAD THE LAKE YOU NAME ALL

00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.127
THE LAKE COUNTY FIRES I'VE HAD.

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.562
AT 50% OF MY LAND HAS BEEN

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:07.164
DESTROYED.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.532
SO THIS IS --

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:09.866
DIFFICULT FOR ME BECAUSE I'M

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:11.234
ALWAYS GOING TO BE CONCERNED

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.003
ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY OF FIRST

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:17.841
RESPONDERS PROBABLY --

00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:21.278
THERE THEY TOPOGRAPHY.

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:23.280
IN MOVIES AREAS IS DIFFICULT.

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:25.081
AND IT IS DIFFICULT I THINK FOR

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.650
ANY PROVIDER TO GET TO SOME OF

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.518
THESE AREAS.

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:30.520
WITH THAT BEING SAID.

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.355
WE FOUGHT FOR LONG TIME TRYING

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.890
TO GET SOME KIND OF COVERAGE OUT

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.158
IN THESE AREAS NOT ONLY FOR THE

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:36.693
FIREFIGHTERS BUT PEOPLE THEY GET

HAVE.

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.010
IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE DO HAVE

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:57.280
TWO PROVIDERS FOR REDUNDANCY --

00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:59.883
BASED ON THE SPORADIC NEED OF

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.084
OUR OWN INDUSTRY.

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:04.621
THAT'S DOUBLE THE COST. TO ADD

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:05.421

00:57:05.488 --> 00:57:06.890
RIGS.

AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGHT

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.459
FOR STAFFING KEEP FOR STOPPING

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:11.861
THAT THAT BECOMES A CHALLENGE.

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:14.297
CAN YOU TAKE US TO THE INCIDENT

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.632

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:17.567
CREEL.

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:18.802

WHERE THEY STATION.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.109
TRYING TO DO THEIR WORK SO THIS

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:27.710
SUPPORT UNIT WILL OPERATE IN

00:57:27.777 --> 00:57:29.379

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.239
DOLLAR BILL IN A MONTH BECAUSE

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.807

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.083
WHAT WOULD THAT BE I DON'T ASK

YOU TO COME WITH A NUMBER FOR

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:35.585
THAT ONE OF THE ON THE SPOT

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:36.819

ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOUR VERIZON

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:38.921
DELICIOUS.

I THINK THAT MY MIND'S ONLY

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:41.991
SLIGHTLY LESS THAN.

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.292
I THINK THAT WAS IN THE CONTEXT

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:46.729
OF TOWARDS THE END OF THIS A BET

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:48.231

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.202
NINETY NINE DOLLARS A MONTH PLUS

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:55.404
A PER GIGABYTE CHARGE --

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:56.806
AND BASED ON USAGE THAT WE'RE

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.207
SEEING THAT ONE UNIT ALONG WOULD

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.643
BE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS --

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.211
SO AGAIN YOU'RE CONSTANTLY

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.312
TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCE

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:04.614
BECAUSE THIS MONTH IT WOULD BE

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.216
INCREDIBLY HIGH.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.218
NEXT MONTH GOD WILLING.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.154

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:29.658
AND LISTEN TO TO CHEAP OUT AND

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:31.393
GO THROUGH HIS --

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.329
EVENTS OF THE PROCESS --

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.597
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE'RE HERE

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.198
TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS PART OF

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.666
THE PROCESS INSTEAD OF TALKING

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.534
ABOUT PARTNERSHIP OF PUBLIC

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:41.036
SAFETY -- I

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:41.670
WILL TELL YOU AS A IT WE TOOK A

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:44.173
STEP.

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.307
I'M AND I THINK YOU HEARD IT

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.942
FROM THE CHIEF THAT THERE'S

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:47.910
OCCURRENCES WHERE WE'RE REALLY

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:49.545
FAST FORUM IN THIS OCCURRENCE

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:50.980
WHERE WENT SLOW --

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.715
AYE ARE MISTAKEN I WOULD SAY

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.083
FROM A LEADERSHIP STANDPOINT I

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.650
THINK YOU'RE THAT FROM THE

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.085
STATEMENT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:57.186
TAKE FULL OWNERSHIP AND

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:58.420
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT I

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:00.022
PERSONALLY DO AS WELL.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.424
AND THE MISTAKE REALLY COMES

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:03.492
DOWN TO WE HAVE HUMAN

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.461
INTERACTION INTERVENTION THAT

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.829
WAS REQUIRED IN THE PROCESS --

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.397
AND WE ON THAT AND IT REALLY

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.665
SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SYSTEM WIDE

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:11.333
AUTOMATIC STEP THAT WAS ABLE TO

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.368
BE ABLE --

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:14.069
TO TO BE DONE WHEN WE CALL SPEED

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:15.604
CAPPER IN THE IN THE MEDIA SCOTT

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:16.939
THROTTLING AS WELL.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:18.240
SO I THINK WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IS

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.576
THAT WE'VE TAKEN STEPS TO MOVE

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:21.443
FOR REMOVED THROUGH --

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:23.145
SPEAK CAPPING FROM FIRST

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.680

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:29.685
INCIDENCES THAT ARE HAPPENING

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:31.320
WHO I THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:32.521

HE WAS A CALLED INTO ONE OF OUR

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.219
CALL CENTERS SO THEY'RE TRAINED

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.420

IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET FROM A

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:52.801
GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE ACTUALLY

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.436
HANDLES THE WHOLE WEST COAST AND

01:12:54.503 --> 01:12:56.171
THEN WE HAVE DEDICATED ACCOUNT

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:57.840
REPRESENTATIVES THAT WORK JUST

01:12:57.906 --> 01:12:59.274
SOLELY ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS I

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.576
KNOW YOU ASKED THAT EARLIER HOW

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:02.111
THAT RELATIONSHIP IS.

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.479
AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE --

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.214
THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE THERE I MEAN

FACE IN CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT.

01:13:18.994 --> 01:13:20.429
SO THOSE ARE KIND OF SOME OF THE

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.131
AREAS A AND WHAT'S I WOULD SAY

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.465

THE A PLUS GROUP IN RETROSPECT

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.887
IT MOVED INTO DIFFERENT.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:47.189
I WOULD HAVE NOT HAD A SYSTEM IN

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:48.891
PLACE THERE REQUIRED --

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.759
OF RAPPER IN INTERACTION TO

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.394

ABOUT.

01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.401
IS THERE I WOULD HAVE HAD A

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.736
SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT AND

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:02.538
AUTOMATICALLY I UTILIZED IT

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:03.605
WHICH I THINK THE NEW PLANTS DO

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.474
THAT FORCE NOW IS OUR SYSTEM

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:07.609
THAT IN WHICH OF A FLAG ALERTS

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:11.213
THE A CLIENT SERVICE REP THAT.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.481
YEAH WE MERGED CEILING NEED TO

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.383
MAKE SURE ALL LINES ARE CLEAR.

01:14:14.449 --> 01:14:14.950
AND WHERE ARE YOU ALL RIGHT

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.318
WHERE YOU ACTUALLY AWARE OF ALL

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.252
THE DATA.

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:18.554
THAT THE FIRE AND OUR FIRST

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.922
RESPONERS HAVE.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:20.889
IN THE BACK OF THEIR CARS

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.457
THEY'VE GOT SO MANY COMPUTERS

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.458
AND ALL THE STATE OF THIS GOING

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:25.694
ON AND I THINK A LOT OF US IN

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:29.198
LOT OF IT'S HAVE NO IDEA.

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:30.599
ALL THE DATA THAT IS NEEDED

PLACES THE RIGHT TIMES AND SO I

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.075
THINK -- I

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.410
ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA CAN

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.145
CONTINUE TO FLOW BECAUSE THAT'S

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:44.313
A LOT OF DATA.

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:46.148
AND IN ITS REALLY EASY TO SAY

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.516
YEAH Y. FLIP THE SWITCHES TO GO

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.418
BUT ARE YOU REALLY READY TO TO

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:50.919
BE ABLE TO ACCESS AND CAN OUR

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.921
FIREFIGHTERS ACCESS THAT IDEA.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.823
THE IF I MAY SIR GREAT GREAT

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:55.924
QUESTION --

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.226
I THINK PRETTY SAID IT PASSED

01:14:57.292 --> 01:14:58.493
EARLIER WE HAVE A LONG STANDING

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.028
HISTORY OF WORKING WITH PUBLIC

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:01.530
SAFETY WHAT THAT IS THE

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:02.998
ADVANTAGE THAT IS GIVEN US.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.299

HAPPENING ON THE FRONTLINE AND

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.036

BINDERS AS WELL AS THERE'S MANY

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:17.279
THINGS IN WHICH WE'VE DEPLOYED

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.947
NOW JUST GIVE YOU AN IDEA MAYBE

ELABORATE WHEN YOU SAY EQUIPMENT --

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:22.017

THEN OFTEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:31.760
IN RURAL SITUATIONS WHERE THEY

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:33.795
NEED ADDITIONAL COVERAGE WE WILL

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:34.897
ROLL OUT --

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:36.698
CALVIN COLDS THOSE ARE PRETTY

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:38.267
MUCH BRINGING OUT A CELL TOWER

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.768

WE AT THIRTY EIGHT SITES THAT

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:50.245
WERE IMPACT 7% CELL SITE

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:51.847
AVAILABILITY --

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:53.115
WITHIN THAT FOR THE FOURTEEN

01:15:53.181 --> 01:15:54.483
DAYS WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED PER HOW

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:56.251
2% SINCE THEN WHAT THAT TELLS ME

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:58.053
IS WE REALLY TOOK I THINK IT WAS

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.254

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.624
PREVENT CELL SITES FROM --

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.426
FACING DESTRUCTION SO WE REALLY

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:05.894
TAKE PRIDE IN THE WAY WE MANAGE

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:07.229
OUR NETWORK FROM THAT STANDPOINT

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:08.797

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.032
WOULD ALSO TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.233
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON THE

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.567
GROUND THAT ARE DELIVERING ON

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:13.869
EVERYTHING FROM CELLPHONES

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.671
ROUTERS HOT SPOTS INTERNET

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.339
CONNECTED LAPTOPS.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.608
CHARGING STATIONS RAP --

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:20.976
FOR THE RED CROSS STATIONS AS

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:21.977
WELL HELPING THOSE THAT HAVE

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:23.412
BEEN EVACUATED IN PROVIDING THEM

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.314
CAN ACTIVITY SO WE'VE ADDED

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.582
CAPACITY TO SITES AS WE SEE THEM

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:29.117
FIT WITHIN THOSE RANGES SO AS AN

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.552
INCIDENT HAPPENS.

WE WILL DIRECT TRAFFIC OR DIRECT

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.288
CAPACITY TO THOSE SITES WHERE

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.590
NEEDED ARE AT AS LONG AS THE

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:37.159
SITUATION ARISES SO I THINK

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:38.827
THAT'S THAT'S A WAYS FROM WHERE

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:39.561
WE STAND WE TRY TO GET

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.463
PROACTIVELY AHEAD OF IT.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.465
SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I'VE BEEN

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.766
NUMEROUS FIRES THE PAST. THREE

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:45.567
YEARS YEAH.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.236
AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.739
BRING OUT THE MOBILE --

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:52.941
THE RISE IN CELLS YOU KNOW

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:53.976
SITTING RIGHT.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:54.943
UNFORTUNATE SOMETIMES THEY SIT

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:56.244

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.245
SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY AFTER TO

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.313
ACTIVATE HIM.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.881
SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT WE

01:16:59.948 --> 01:17:02.718

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:05.087
THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL --

01:17:05.153 --> 01:17:05.821
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS I

01:17:05.887 --> 01:17:07.222
ALWAYS HAVE TO GO BACK FROM

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.757

AREAS BECAUSE THEIR VOICE IS NOT

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:18.834

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.725
DIFFERENT WAY I'M REALLY WITH

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:38.860
ALL OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:41.262
BECAUSE IT SOUNDED TO ME THAT

01:26:41.329 --> 01:26:43.197
WHILE THERE WERE MISTAKES IT WAS

01:26:43.264 --> 01:26:44.632
ALSO VERY EVIDENT.

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:46.334
THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY CAN'T

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.269
LIVE WITHOUT THE PRODUCTS AND SO

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:50.672
THAT IS PART OF THE NECESSITY TO

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:51.272
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:52.840
FORWARD -- I

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:54.475
KNOW IT'S ALSO VERY COMPLICATED

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.010
ON AUGUST NINTH --

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:58.313

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.520
WHERE I HAD.

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.622
MY SON WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.123
WORKING AND MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:11.125
FIRING THE PHONE AND IT HAPPENED

01:27:11.192 --> 01:27:12.727

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:13.227
OF YOURS.

01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:16.064
SO IT'S COMPLICATED WE THINGS

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:19.734
MIGHT HAVE AND BUT I WOULD

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.202
REALLY HOPE THAT WHAT COMES OUT

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:24.105
OF TODAY IS NOT JUST.

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.774
A FOCUS ON ONE COMPANY BUT A WAY

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:28.009

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:35.516
NEW NORMAL AS THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:38.052

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.282
ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.051
NEED TO HAPPEN OUTSIDE OF THIS

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:45.053
PARTICULAR HEARING CONVERSATIONS

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:47.055
THAT NOT ONLY INFORM HOW WE MOVE

01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.890

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.124
THE WAY WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:52.493

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.594
THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN

01:28:53.661 --> 01:28:55.496

01:28:55.563 --> 01:28:57.298
HAVE LEARN BEST PRACTICES THAT

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.100

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.902
BE LOOKED AT IN A WAY THAT THIS

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:05.239

01:29:05.306 --> 01:29:06.774
WE WANNA KNOW THOSE BECAUSE WE

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.943

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:49.910
SPECIFIC THAN THAT AND THEN HOW

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:51.745

EVALUATING BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:07.862
FENCE THERE AS WELL AND THEN

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:08.729
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MANY

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:10.431
SITUATIONS WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT

01:36:10.498 --> 01:36:10.831
THROUGH.

01:36:10.898 --> 01:36:12.433
ARE THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT --

01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:13.734

SITUATIONS AND STUFF LIKE THAT

01:36:17.204 --> 01:36:20.608
SO THE GREAT PART IS THAT GO OUT

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:21.775
WITH FIRST RESPONDERS.

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.344
THERE IT WON'T MATTER ABOUT THE

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.246
INCIDENT ITSELF BECAUSE THEY

01:36:25.312 --> 01:36:27.047
WILL ALREADY HAVE THAT ABILITY

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:28.382
TO USE THAN THE NETWORK THAT WE

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:29.950
WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS.

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:33.521
IT'S MORE OF FOR BACK OFFICE --

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:34.955
ADAM I WOULD SAY THAT THEY'RE

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:35.756
THE PEOPLE THAT COULD BE

01:36:35.823 --> 01:36:37.024
POTENTIALLY NOT OUT ON THE

01:36:37.091 --> 01:36:39.593
FRONTLINE THAT COULD HAVE THAT

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:40.227
PROCESS THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:40.895
SO YOU'RE.

01:36:40.961 --> 01:36:41.896
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING IT'S

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:42.796
NOT SOME THAT WE NEED TO WORRY

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.565
ABOUT BUT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.800
CRITERIA FOR THE CONSIDERATION

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.502
OF WHAT IS A DISASTER.

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:49.970
AND WHO DO YOU WORK WITH TO

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:51.005
DEFINE.

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:54.241
WHAT THOSE CRITERIA MIGHT BE AND?

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.609
TO GET TO THAT POINT YOUR HEART

01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:56.944
NOT IN IT YEAH TRYING TO FIGURE

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:57.945
THIS OUT RIGHT NOW AND THEN I

01:36:58.012 --> 01:36:59.547
GOT YOU KNOW I I I WOULD SAY WE

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:01.348
WE UNDERSTAND NATURAL DISASTERS

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:03.517
PRETTY MUCH I THINK WHAT --

01:37:03.584 --> 01:37:04.852
MOST OF THE WORLD WOULD LOOK AT

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:05.786
ABOUT IT WHAT I WAS SAYING THERE

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:07.321
SOME SITUATIONS WE PROBABLY

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:09.823
HAVEN'T THOUGHT THROUGH --

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:11.692
A FIRST RESPONDER THOUGH --

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:13.494
AS A DISASTER LET'S SEE

01:37:13.561 --> 01:37:15.796
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO NEXT WEEK --

01:37:15.863 --> 01:37:18.832
THEY WOULD NOT NEED TO SPEED

01:37:18.899 --> 01:37:20.534
CAPITA ALREADY BE OFF SO THEY

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:21.702
DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:24.071
PART OF IT IS THEY GO THROUGH IT --

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:24.872
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WAS I WAS

01:37:24.939 --> 01:37:26.840
REFERRING TO AND NOT HAVING TO

01:37:26.907 --> 01:37:27.608
TO WORK THROUGH IT I THINK

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:28.576
THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE

01:37:28.642 --> 01:37:29.810
INTERNALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:31.212
WE'VE REALLY EXCLUSIVE AND

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:32.413
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT OF ALL THE

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.548
SITUATIONS THAT GETTING ANCHOR.

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:35.883
DOES WITH NOTICE AND THOSE

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:36.951
WITHOUT --

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.152
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT THE

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:39.553
PROPER STEPS IN PLACE SINCE WE

01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:40.988
HAVE A COMMITTEE INTERNALLY

01:37:41.055 --> 01:37:43.357
THAT'S WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW --

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:45.125
AS EVERYTHING HAS BEEN --

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:46.293
BROUGHT TO LIGHT AYE AS YOU

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.261
WOULD IMAGINE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:48.596
PEOPLE WITH AMBER EYES AND

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:49.230
ENSURING THAT WE PUT THE RIGHT

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.831
STEPS FORWARD SO THAT WE DON'T

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.066
HAVE.

01:37:52.132 --> 01:37:52.633
THAT THIS TYPE OF SITUATION

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.235
HAPPEN AGAIN YOU GOT YOUR MOVING

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.803
QUICKLY AND I APPRECIATE THAT

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:57.004
YOU DOING THAT SO TO SPEAK CAPS

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:58.339
ARE LIFTED THERE IS A NEW PLAN

01:37:58.405 --> 01:38:00.741
NEXT WEEK AND IT WILL TAKE TIME

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:01.942
FOR THEM.

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:02.910
TO BE ENROLLED IN THAT NEW PLAN

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:04.712
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:07.414
PEOPLE FROM BENEFITING FROM.

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:09.216
THIS STUFF BEFORE YOU GET TO

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.384
THAT ABSOLUTE BECAUSE THERE ARE

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:11.819
PEOPLE ON EMERGENCY AND THEY'RE

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:13.187
DOING THEIR JOB AND YOU WILL

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:13.721
WORRY ABOUT BILLING LATER

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:14.021
[inaudible]

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:16.257
CORRECT.

01:38:16.323 --> 01:38:17.424
OKAY TWENTY MAKE SURE THAT WAS

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:19.460
CLEAR -- IN

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.862
IN THE LIFTING OF RESTRICTIONS

01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:23.864
AND THE DEFINITION OF DISASTER.

01:38:23.931 --> 01:38:25.666
DO YOU HAVE EIGHTY I ASK ABOUT

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:26.800
THE CRITERIA.

01:38:26.867 --> 01:38:28.002
WHO MAKES THE DECISION

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.570
ULTIMATELY WHO DEFINES THIS

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.639
ORDER OR SAYS YET IT'S ALL BEEN

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:32.172

YOU KNOW HIERARCHY THAT DOES

01:38:35.976 --> 01:38:38.612
THAT THERE IS NOT ONE PERSON --

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:39.613
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.516
AND AND A LARGE BOTTLE NECK NAM

01:38:42.583 --> 01:38:43.984
IT'S A GROUP OF HAVE COMMITTEE

01:38:44.051 --> 01:38:45.452

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:46.920
REQUIREMENTS BEING MET TOGETHER

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.789
AND I WOULD SAY WE STILL NEED TO

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:50.324
DO A BETTER JOB OF DEFINING.

01:38:50.391 --> 01:38:51.992
WHAT THOSE ARE REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.527

IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE OF

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:03.437
LINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:05.205
INCIDENT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED.

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:08.742
I CAN ATTEST THAT COMMITTEES CAN

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:11.478

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:39.273
ON IT IS A DISASTER OR THAT A

01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:42.376

OF EMERGENCY TO BE CALLED IN AND

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:56.256

WHERE YOU'RE SITTING TODAY

01:40:21.648 --> 01:40:22.182

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.239
I THINK I AM I DON'T WANT TO AND

01:40:45.305 --> 01:40:49.376
I HOW 2% FOR SURE ON THE

01:40:49.443 --> 01:40:51.578
MAGNITUDE OF EVERY STEP BUT THE

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:52.780
PROCESS WOULD BE SHARED.

01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:54.982
LEARNING FROM THIS ENVIRONMENT --

01:40:55.048 --> 01:40:56.850

THEY'RE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.124
PROCESS AND THAT WOULD THEN BE A

ABLE TO SHARE YEAH BUT HE WAS

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.196
STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT TO

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:10.798
MAKE SURE THE STEPS ARE AND AND

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:11.632
PLACE WHICH I THINK IT'S

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.155
FORWARD WITH A DIFFERENT PLAN

01:47:42.222 --> 01:47:44.724
AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE. TO SEE

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.326

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:48.862
AND THAT IS TAKEN INTO

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:50.664
CONSIDERATION.

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:53.300
I KNOW THAT --

01:47:53.366 --> 01:47:55.402
THE THOMAS FIRE I SPENT FORTY

01:47:55.468 --> 01:47:56.102
DAYS --

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:57.771
DEALING WITH THAT PARTICULAR

01:47:57.838 --> 01:47:58.939
NATURAL DISASTER AND THERE WERE

01:47:59.005 --> 01:48:02.442
SO MANY MISTAKES I MADE ERRORS --

01:48:02.509 --> 01:48:04.744
I HAD THAT HAPPENED --

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.913
IT'S HARD TO PREVENT AND PREDICT

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.014
ALL OF THEM.

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:10.450
AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:11.284
ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T HAPPEN

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.986
AGAIN -- AND

01:48:13.053 --> 01:48:15.222

ANY INDIVIDUALS --

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:24.731
