00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:15.802
FOR SEVERAL REASONS THE NO

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:17.603
RECEIPT IS VERY MUCH A PROBLEM

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:18.971
FOR MANY OF OUR MEMBERS.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.773
RECEIPTS ARE IMPORTANT TOOL TO

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.909
HELP US PREVENT -- THEFT AND

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.611
THEY'RE IMPORTANT LOSS

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:26.679
PREVENTION TOOL OUR A SALES

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.815
ASSOCIATE SOMETIMES ASK PEOPLE

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.650
TO SEE THEM T THE DOOR OR AS A

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:31.951
ROLE AS THEY HAVE LEFT THE STORE.

00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:34.554
SO IT IS IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THAT --

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.055
AS YOU RECALL THE VOTERS PASSED

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.158
PROP ONE PROP PASSED PROP --

00:07:39.225 --> 00:07:40.827
FORTY SEVEN THAT'S IT'S A NINE

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:41.928
HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR SAFT

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.596
LIMIT IN EVERYTHING BELOW THAT

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:45.331
IS A MISDEMEANOR WE NOW SEE

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.499
CRIMINALS COMING IN THE STORE

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:48.067
WITH CALCULATORS TO MAKE SURE

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.635
THAT THEY STAY BELOW THAT LEVEL.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.103
AND SO THIS IS TAKING AWAY ONE

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.839
MORE TOOL FOR US IN LOSS

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:53.539
PREVENTION.

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:55.274
OUT ALSO NOTE THAT MANY STORES

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.109
HAVE A RECEIPT REQUIREMENT FOR

00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:58.411
RETURNS AND SO IF A CUSTOMER

00:07:58.477 --> 00:07:59.312
DECIDES THEY DON'T WANT TO

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:00.847
RECEIVE AT THE POINT OF SALE AND

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.714
THEN WANTS TO BRING SOMETHING

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.883
BACK -- THEY'LL BE FRUSTRATED

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.585
WITH THE RETAILER BECAUSE THEY

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.954
CHOSE NOT TO GET A RECEIPT ALSO

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.356
IT IS EASY -- FOR CONSUMERS WHO

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.058
WANT TO HAVE STOLEN SOMETHING

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.359
WANT TO BRING BACK A RECEIPT TO

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:16.195
DUMMY UP A RECEIPT -- AND COMMIT

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:17.496
RECEIPT FRAUD IT SOMETHING WE

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.432
FIGHT EVERY DAY THE OTHER THING

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:20.833
THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.902
THE LIMITATION ON WHAT WE CAN

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:24.136

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:25.972
A RECEIPT FOR NON ESSENTIAL

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.874

00:08:29.275 --> 00:08:30.509

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.995
THINGS WOULD BE POTENTIALLY

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:50.329

AND WE HAVE CONCERNS. FOR THOSE

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:55.434

SMALL NUMBER OF RETAILERS ALONE.

THESE CONCERNS ALL MAKE IT

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:08.881

TRAFFIC IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:45.811

ON STRAW PURCHASES OF COURSE --

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:55.581
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME

00:11:55.648 --> 00:11:57.483
FOR SUPPLIERS TO MEET THE DEMAND

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.051

YES -- I I DO HAVE BY MYSELF

00:14:00.372 --> 00:14:02.208
UNUSUAL UNUSUALLY CONCERNED

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:06.478
ABOUT A NUMBER OF OF THINGS -- I

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:08.280
DO THINK THAT THERE WHAT I'VE

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.382
HEARD THAT THERE IS -- A VALID

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.652
CONCERN ABOUT LOSS PREVENTION --

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.221
AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:16.755
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I'M NOT

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:18.524
SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE SOLUTION

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:22.962
IS BUT I DO SEE HOW THAT IS -- A

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.930
VERY VALID CONCERN I DIDN'T KNOW

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:26.031
THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH RECEIPT

00:14:26.098 --> 00:14:27.433
FRAUD SO I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG IT

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:29.568
IS BUT THAT JUST CAUGHT MY

00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:33.572
ATTENTION -- WITH REGARDS TO THE

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:35.674
RECEIPTS -- AS THEIR BEEN

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:39.845
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY --

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:41.647
USE OF RECEIPTS LIKE THE

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.782
CUSTOMER IS THAT INCLUDED IN

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:45.918
YOUR AND I DIDN'T TWO IS SET TO

00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:48.554
THE AUTHOR YES YEAH SO THEY ARE

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:51.223
ON WE WE HAVE HAD -- CONVERSES

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.958
WITH RETAILERS ABOUT DIFFERENT

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.527
OPTIONS -- THERE THAT'S WHY WE

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.096
PUT THE BILL WHERE IT'S RECEIPT

00:14:57.162 --> 00:14:58.631
UPON DEMAND YOU CAN EITHER ASK

00:14:58.697 --> 00:14:59.798
FOR NO RECEIVED AS FOR PAPER

00:14:59.865 --> 00:15:00.599
RECEIPT.

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.067
IT REALLY GIVES YOU THOSE

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:03.969
OPTIONS AND THEN WHAT WE FOCUSED

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:05.504
ON IN TERMS OF THE PAPER.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.073
IT IS REALLY WHAT THE USE OF THE

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:08.574
PAPER WAS THOSE OF THE

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.675
AMENDMENTS WE TOOK OUT OF

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:10.743
ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS. TO

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:14.947
REALLY LIMIT THE RECEIPT TO THE

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.849
RECEIPT NOT TERM MARKETING

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:17.483
MATERIAL IN FACT I THOUGHT THE

00:15:17.549 --> 00:15:18.584
SENATE.

00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.220
ANALYSIS POINTED OUT -- QUITE

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:23.522
QUITE WELL AN ARTICLE THAT SAID --

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.357
THE A PARTICULAR BE TO I'M NOT

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:25.958
GONNA GO INTO THE PARTICULAR

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:27.559
RETAILER BUT THEIR RECEIPT WAS

00:15:27.626 --> 00:15:29.461
OVER THREE FEET LONGER THAN IT

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:30.562
EITHER NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:31.397
TYPICAL RISKY.

00:15:31.463 --> 00:15:32.831
AND THEY'RE FAIRLY FAMOUS FOR

00:15:32.898 --> 00:15:34.767
THEIR VERY LONG RECEIPTS AND

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:38.504
THIS IS EXCLUDING THE RECEIPT

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.338
AND THE COUPONS [inaudible]

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:40.539
HA.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.907
I'M AND THE ISSUE OF THE PAPER

00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:44.610
AND THE IS THE PAPER AND THE INK.

00:15:44.677 --> 00:15:47.212
THE THE PAPER IT IS A TOXIC.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:49.014
THE IT IS IT'S ACTUALLY PAPER

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:50.916
ITSELF THE PAPERS OFFICE COATED

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:54.453
WITH -- BPA SLASH PPS -- THAT IS

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.788
THE PART THAT'S TOXIC BECAUSE IT

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.890
REQUIRES THAT CHEMICAL SO THAT

00:15:57.956 --> 00:15:59.291
THE INQUIRIES SHOULD ON THE

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:00.793
PAPER CAPTION.

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:01.560
UHHUH.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.462
AND WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:05.364
THAT THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE

00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:08.067
OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THAT.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.501
WELL THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO WAITED

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:10.502
TO BEGIN THE BILL'S NOT GOING

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.771
INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY ONE

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:13.339
TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO THERE'S

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:16.875
TIME. TO TRANSITION -- AGAIN BUT

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.911
THE STUDY SAYS THAT 93% OF THE

00:16:18.977 --> 00:16:21.080
RECEIPTS ARE USING THIS KIND OF

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:24.183
PAPER SO THAT MEANS 7% AREN'T

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:24.783
AND SO THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.318
OUT THERE.

00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:27.252
BUT THAT'S I GUESS THAT'S TO MY

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:28.854
NEXT QUESTION IS.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:32.758
THE WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.193
THE PAPER NOT [inaudible]

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:36.195
TOXIC.

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.963
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.531
INVESTMENT THAT READILY

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.200
AVAILABLE IS THAT A BIG PROBLEM

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:42.201
WHAT.

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:44.603
WHAT IS THE?

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.072
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES AS FAR AS?

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:48.941
USING THEM AND NEEDING THEM AND

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:50.576
WANTING THE RECEIPTS HOW DO YOU

00:16:50.642 --> 00:16:53.145
DEAL WITH THAT PROBLEM OF THE

00:16:53.212 --> 00:16:54.780
PAPER SAYS TO THE PAPER THAT WE

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.248
USE TODAY THE PAPER THAT YOU'RE

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:58.250
USING TURN TO RETURN MATERIALS

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.418
IS.

00:16:59.485 --> 00:17:01.453
NOT LAYS WITH PPA PPS FOR THE

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.922
PAPER ITSELF IS.

00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:05.524
READILY AVAILABLE -- IN TERMS OF

00:17:05.591 --> 00:17:07.626
HOW IT INTERFACES WITH THE

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.361
DIFFERENT RETAIL MACHINES I

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:09.995
THINK THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY

00:17:10.062 --> 00:17:11.497
BETTER IN A BETTER QUESTION TO

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:14.466
ASK THE DIFFERENT RETAILERS -- I

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:15.968
DID ONE OF THOSE SINCE IT SHOULD

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.803
MENTION ALSO LOSS PREVENTION --

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.104
I THINK THAT -- GET SOMETHING

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.739
THAT WE HAD TALKED TO THE

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:21.306
RETAILERS ABOUT THAT IS A

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.408
CONCERN.

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:24.977
HAVING SAID THAT MOST RETAILERS

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:26.678
DON'T CHECK YOUR RECEIPT UPON

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:27.980
EXITING THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:29.648
THAT ARE FAIRLY WELL KNOWN COSCO

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.451
BEST BUY FOR EXAMPLE -- MOST OF

00:17:32.518 --> 00:17:33.352
THE RETAILERS IF YOU'RE IN A

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:35.554
SUPERMARKET I I SHOP AT

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:37.856
WALGREENS OR THE CVS OR RITE AID

00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:40.626
AND I CAN'T RECALL THE LAST TIME

00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:43.262
I WAS STOPPED -- UPON EXITING

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.431
PUMP PAYING AN ACCIDENT SO CAN I

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:46.165
UNDERSTAND THE LOSS PREVENTION

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.766
ISSUE THAT THERE DEFINITELY HAS

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.035
BEEN A BROADER ISSUE BUT I DON'T

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:51.570
BELIEVE THE RECEIPTS ARE THE THE

00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:53.338
RECEIPT OR THE LACK OF RECEIPTS

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:53.839
IS REALLY.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.442
THE ISSUE THE THE CHALLENGE WITH

00:17:56.508 --> 00:17:57.042
LOSS PREVENTIONS WE ACTUALLY

00:17:57.109 --> 00:17:57.609
HAVE.

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:59.144
BEEN A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES THAT

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.712
ARE ORGANIZED IN ARE GOING INTO

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.147
STORES AND STEALING THINGS I

00:18:02.214 --> 00:18:02.948
DON'T THINK.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.083
THEY'RE GONNA STOP BECAUSE

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:11.089
PEOPLE HAVE RECEIPTS OR DON'T

00:18:11.156 --> 00:18:13.091
HAVE.

00:18:13.158 --> 00:18:13.692
FOR SIX I THINK THERE'S A FEW

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.794
MORE STORES ARE STARTING TO USE

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:17.729
AT HOME DEPOT DOZEN SOME OF THE

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:19.398
ONES BUT ANYWAY YEAH.

00:18:19.465 --> 00:18:20.065
I I DON'T LIST ALL OF THEM YEAH.

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:21.366
COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE ISSUE

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.534
OF THE PAPER.

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:24.002
CERTAINLY -- WE DO KNOW THAT THE

00:18:24.069 --> 00:18:26.472
B. P. A. B. P. S. FREE PAPER IS

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:29.842
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE --

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.678
NEED IT AB FOR OUR MEMBERS IN

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:33.946
CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:37.950
WE REPRESENT LARGER AT RETAILERS --

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:39.651
IT CAN BE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:41.220
OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:42.988
YEAR -- SOME OF OUR POINT OF

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.157
SALE SYSTEMS WILL NEED TO BE --

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:47.659
SIGNIFICANTLY REPROGRAMMED TO

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:48.727
DEAL WITH THIS SOME OF THEM

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.929
AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE RECEIPTS

00:18:50.996 --> 00:18:53.065
SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COSTS

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.566
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS.

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:56.869
AND IF I MAY I'D ALSO SAY THAT --

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.670
THE LOSS PREVENTION IS A PIECE

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:00.072
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO US WE DON'T

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:02.541
CHECK EVERY CUSTOMER IN EVERY

00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.243
ONE OF OUR STORES BUT IT IS

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.310
SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:05.677
US.

00:19:05.744 --> 00:19:07.479
IT IS ONE OF THE FEW TOOLS THAT

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.414
WE HAVE TO HELP REDUCE THEFT IN

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:10.415
OUR STORES I WOULD LIKE TO

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.918
MENTION THAT EUROPE DOES HAVE B.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:16.722
P. FREE SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:19.157
THAT CAN'T BE DONE -- AND IT'S

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:19.825
ALREADY BEING DONE IN EUROPE SO

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.493
I ASSUME THAT THEY WOULD.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.828
BE ABLE TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.197
WITHOUT SPENDING ENORMOUS COSTS

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:26.732
THAT'S AN ISSUE ACTUALLY IN THE

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:28.333
NEXT COMMITTEE.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.036
IN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THE OB.

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.805
THE CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE LOSS

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:37.943
PREVENTION -- IS ONE ARGUABLY --

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.612
THAT IS MORE WITHIN OUR PURVIEW

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:42.214
ARE ISSUES ACTUALLY DEAL WITH

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:44.316
THE FINES AND THE FACT THAT THEY

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:47.853
DID THE TOOK THE AMENDMENTS --

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.888
WHICH REMOVE THE PRIVACY

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.124
CONCERNS WE HAD AND FRANKLY THE

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.992
PENALTY I ISSUES ARE WITHIN OUR

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:55.761

00:19:59.097 --> 00:19:59.965
THAT.

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.434
CAN'T REALLY BE THE MAJOR.

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:05.237
DETERMINANT OF THE OPPOSITION --

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.272

00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:09.308
GET THAT RE FOCUSED ON THE LOSS

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.475

SOMETHING BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.714
THIS COULD BE ARGUABLY AN ISSUE

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:24.282
FOR LOW INCOME FOLKS.

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:26.718

OF THE FUEL THAT'S WHAT THEY

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:44.870
FEEL THEY WANT BEFORE THEY WALK

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.004

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.109
IN TERMS OF LOSS PREVENTION.

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:53.078
FRANKLY THE MOST PROFITABLE

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.780
RETAILER YOU JUST MENTIONED THEM.

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.682

SQUARE FOOT BASIS AS APPLE AND

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.785
THEY FRANKLY HAVE BEEN AT LEAST

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:00.752
N THE BAY AREA PROBABLY ONE OF

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.988
THE MOST HIGH PROFILE TARGETS OF

00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:03.522
THEFT.

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:04.523
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO APPLE

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:06.158
STORES AND STEALING APPLE

ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF?

00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:13.565

AT APPLE STORES A PAPER SEE.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.334
APPLE HAS BEEN PAPERLESS FOR

00:22:16.401 --> 00:22:17.502
QUITE AWHILE AND IF YOU WANT TO

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:19.371
MAKE A PURCHASE YOU CAN DO MANY

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:20.839
THINGS BUT YOU CAN'T GET A PAPER

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.973
SEAT NOT AN APPLE STORE. TO

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.042
RETAILERS ARE ALREADY MOVING IN

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:25.143
THIS DIRECTION IF YOU GO ACROSS

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.344
THE STREET GET A CUP OF COFFEE

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:28.947
CHECKER YOU MIGHT REALIZE THEY

00:22:29.614 --> 00:22:30.115

SO -- THE PAPER RECEIPTS RIGHT

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.820
NOW AGAIN I TALKED ABOUT THE

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:36.388
MILLIONS OF POUNDS OF WASTE.

00:22:36.455 --> 00:22:38.290
ON TOP OF THAT THEY CONTAMINATE

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:39.991
OUR WASTE STREAM.

00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:42.294
SO IF YOU WANT TO RECYCLE THE

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.995

YOU CANNOT PUT IN YOUR COMPOST

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:55.741
SO IF YOU GET A RECEIPT.

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:57.075
THAT'S YOUR AGREES WITH PAPER

00:22:57.142 --> 00:22:59.010
THE PIZZA BOX CAN GO INTO THE

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:00.479
COMPOST.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:02.814
THE RECEIPT CAN'T BECAUSE IT IS

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.383
LAYS WITH THIS TOXIC CHEMICAL SO

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:06.251
AGAIN.

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:08.720
WE WE THINK THIS IS SOMETHING TO

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:10.255
REALLY MAKE US AS CALIFORNIA'S

00:23:10.322 --> 00:23:12.691
RETHINK HOW WE ARE USING A

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:14.426
PARTICULAR KIND OF PRODUCT WE

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:15.794
NEED TO BE MUCH SMARTER ABOUT

00:23:15.861 --> 00:23:18.063
OUR WASTE WHETHER IT'S PLASTIC

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.898
OR PAPER -- WE THINK THIS IS A

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:20.966
VERY SMALL STEP AGAIN TO

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:24.002
CONSUMERS HAVE EVERY ABILITY. TO

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.637
ASK FOR THIS PAPER CA WHEN WE

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:26.104
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.440
ADDITIONAL COSTS MY STAFF WAS

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:29.708
SAYING -- THERE'S AN ESTIMATE TO

00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.711

THE BPA PAPER VERSUS THE TOXIC

00:23:35.847 --> 00:23:36.548
FREE PAPERS.

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.150
BUT EVENTUALLY ADDITIONAL SEVEN

00:23:38.216 --> 00:23:40.619
DOLLARS A BOX SO WE THINK THAT

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:42.387
THIS CAN BE DONE -- THAT IS THE

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:43.755
CHAIR MENTIONED EUROPE WE THINK

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.157
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

00:23:45.223 --> 00:23:46.725
TO TAKE THE LEAD ON IT'S ALWAYS

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:49.127
DIFFICULT TO LEAD -- AND SO YOU

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:50.562
DON'T HAVE AS MUCH EVIDENCE IN

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:51.797
TERMS OF OTHER STATES.

00:23:51.863 --> 00:23:53.365

FROM ONE MILLION TO TWO MILLION.

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:02.774
SO IN ORDER TO BE IMPACTED --

00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:04.442
YOU HAVE TO BE GROSSING MORE

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:05.577
THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:07.212
TERMS OF RESTAURANTS.

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:08.680

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:22.367
SO EQUAL JUSTICE SOCIETY HAS

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.635
BEEN STUDYING IMPLICIT BIAS FOR

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.537
TWENTY YEARS SPECIFICALLY HOW IT

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.172
AFFECTS INDIVIDUAL DECISION

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:29.040
MAKING.

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:32.076
AND HOW IT AFFECTS INSTITUTIONS.

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:33.711
AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.180
ALL PEOPLE HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS.

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.950
AND OUT WE ALSO CALL THAT

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:40.685
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.

00:33:40.752 --> 00:33:42.153
AND THOSE BIASES DEVELOPING

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.354
DEVELOP DURING THE COURSE OF A

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:45.456
LIFETIME TO EXPOSURE TO STEREO

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.725
TYPES USUALLY RACIAL AND GENDER

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.427
STEREOTYPES.

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:51.529
NO IMPLICIT BIAS INFLUENCES OUR

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:53.464
BELIEFS OUR ATTITUDES AND MOST

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:55.767
IMPORTANTLY OUR BEHAVIORS AND

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:56.601
OUR ACTIONS.

00:33:56.667 --> 00:34:01.773
AND IT RUNS COUNTER. TO OUR

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:04.709
BELIEFS AND OUR VALUES OFTEN

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.377
WHICH IS WHAT SO INSIDIOUS ABOUT.

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:10.081
IMPLICIT BIAS -- AND AS FAR AS

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:12.583
INSTITUTIONS INDIVIDUAL IMPLICIT

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.352
BIAS IS REPLICATED IN OUR

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:16.187
INSTITUTIONS SO IT CAN END UP

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:16.888
HAVING.

00:34:16.954 --> 00:34:20.992
A HUGE IMPACT INSTITUTIONALLY.

00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.026
NOTE.

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:23.694
JUDGES ARE PEOPLE TOO SO THEY'RE

00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:26.597
CERTAINLY NOT IMMUNE TO BIAS.

00:34:26.664 --> 00:34:28.499
YET ASTONISHINGLY STUDIES SHOW

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:32.403
THAT 99% OF JUDGES SELF REPORT.

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:33.604
THAT THEIR JUDICIAL DECISIONS

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:36.607
ARE UNLIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:39.377
RACIAL AND GENDER BIAS COMPARED

00:34:39.444 --> 00:34:40.812
TO THEIR COLLEAGUES.

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:42.180
SO EVEN THOUGH COMMITTEE JUDGES

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.348
EMBRACE THE CONCEPT OF IMPLICIT

00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:47.018
BIAS WHEN IT COMES.

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:47.652
TO I'M.

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:49.153
THINKING ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.255
THEM IN THE COURT ROOM AS BENCH

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:52.290
OFFICERS.

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:55.426
THEY MAY NOT -- COMPLETELY

00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:57.228
EXCEPT THAT IT IS HAVING AN

00:34:57.295 --> 00:35:00.031
IMPACT ON THEIR COURTROOM AND ON

00:35:00.097 --> 00:35:01.833
THEIR DECISION MAKING -- I'LL

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.668
JUST POINT TO A COUPLE OF QUICK

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:05.002
STUDIES COULD BECAUSE WHO ARE

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.437
COMING UP ON THE TWO MINUTE Là

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.538
GOT IT.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:09.307
SO JUST WHAT ONE IMPACTFUL STUDY

00:35:09.373 --> 00:35:11.375
IS THAT LOCALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:12.743
BLACK DEFENDANTS ARE HELD IN PRE

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:15.213
TRIAL CUSTODY 62% LONGER THAN

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:16.347
WHITE DEFENDANTS.

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:18.149
AND BLACK DEFENDANTS RECEIVED

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:19.784
28% LONGER SENTENCES THAN WHITE

00:35:19.851 --> 00:35:22.220
DEFENDANTS CONVICTED OF THE SAME

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:22.820
CRIMES.

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:25.122
SO POINT BEING COUNTED BY IS%

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:26.791
TRAINING IS A IS A PRACTICAL

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:30.127
TOOL FOR JUDGES AND THEY'RE ALL

00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:30.828
THEIR OFFICERS WHO WORK WITH

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:33.931
THEM -- TO BECOME AWARE.

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:35.266
OF THEIR OWN BIASES AND TO

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:37.935
ACCEPT THEIR BIASES AND TO LEARN

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:40.137
TOOLS TO MANAGE AS A CRISIS.

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:41.339

FOR NUMBER YEARS I CAN ATTEST TO

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:26.050
THE GENDER BASED BIAS THAT --

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:27.818
CERTAINLY HAS EXISTED AND

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:29.220
PROBABLY STILL DOES I

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:31.389
FORTUNATELY BEEN RECOVERING FOR

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.924
NUMBER YEARS I HAVE BEEN IN THE

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.092
COURTROOM FOR A WHILE -- AND WE

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.227
KNOW WITH LITIGANTS THERE ARE

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:38.829
SIMILAR ISSUES OF MY ONLY

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:40.131
CONCERN.

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:41.465
HOW WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:43.935
IS A COMPETENT TRAINING YOU'VE

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:45.436
GIVE TRIED TO IDENTIFY THAT?

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:47.305
BUT PUTTING A BUNCH OF LAWYERS

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:48.606
IN A ROOM.

00:36:48.673 --> 00:36:50.942
A BUNCH OF JUDGES IN A ROOM IS

00:36:51.008 --> 00:36:52.910
OFTEN A CHALLENGE TO GET THEM.

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.245
TO PAY ATTENTION I SAID THERE

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:55.880
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I AM

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.848
MARRIED TO A RETIRED JUDGE BUT

00:36:57.915 --> 00:36:59.450
KNOWING THAT SO MANY.

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:01.552
THINK THAT THEY AS YOU MENTIONED

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.287
THEY SELF REPORT THERE'S NO BIAS

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:04.689
IN WHAT THEY DO.

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.424
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN BE

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.825
ASSURED WITH THESE VARIOUS

00:37:07.892 --> 00:37:11.028
PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

00:37:11.095 --> 00:37:11.629
BE EFFECTIVE.

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:14.031
RIGHT SO -- AS A AS AS SOMEONE

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:14.565
WHO'S ACTUALLY MERRY TUNE

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:15.633
ATTORNEY I UNDERSTAND THE

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.135
CHALLENGE IT IS WHEN YOU'RE IN

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:21.706
THE ROOM WITH THEM -- THIS IS A

00:37:21.772 --> 00:37:23.274
LITTLE LESS STILL LOOK AT THE

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.875
HISTORY BY TO THE NO LESS TRUE

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:27.912
OKAY -- THIS IS SO A I THINK THE

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:29.280
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS ADDRESS

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.915
SOME OF THAT BY MAKING SURE THAT

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:31.782
THERE'S SOME COMPETENCY

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:33.684
REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO

00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:34.986
IDENTIFYING THE FOLKS THAT WILL

00:37:35.052 --> 00:37:36.988
BE -- DEM OVERSEEING THE

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:39.023
TRAINING AND THERE IS AN

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.525
IMPLEMENTATION -- PERIOD OF

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:42.059
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THIS

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:43.461
DOESN'T KICK IN UNTIL THEN I

00:37:43.527 --> 00:37:44.562
THINK IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY START

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.297
UNTIL TWENTY TWO SO IT ALLOWS

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:47.465
FOR THERE TO BE SOMETIME IN

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:48.766
THESE DISCUSSIONS.

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:49.934
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:37:50.001 --> 00:37:51.369
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WILL BE

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:52.903
NO TRAINING THAT WILL COMPLETELY

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.839
AROUND TO KEEP ANYTHING

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:55.906
PARTICULARLY AND PLUS AT OUR

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:57.408
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.809
IN I AM NOT GOING TO SUGGEST

00:37:58.876 --> 00:37:59.944
THAT THIS BILL IS A SILVER

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:02.880
BULLET FOR THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY --

00:38:02.947 --> 00:38:05.449
WILL WORK TO ADDRESS THE BIAS IN

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:06.684
WAYS THAT WILL HELP FOLKS

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:08.419
COUNTER ACTED IN BRACE CITIC

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.154
KNOWLEDGE IT SO THAT THEY CAN BE

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:11.288
BETTER.

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:13.624
AT THEIR JOBS IF IT IS ON THE

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.393
BENCH ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.628
TO HAVING JUDICIAL DISCRETION

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.230
AND HOW IT'S WIELDED AND WIN --

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:20.631
TWO OFFICERS OF THE COURT AND

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:22.199
HOW THEY'RE INTERACTING -- WITH

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.901
DEFENDANTS PLAINTIFFS IN THE

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:26.337
GENERAL PUBLIC -- I THINK IT IS

00:38:26.404 --> 00:38:28.739
ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE --

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.174
MONITORING AND INPUT FROM

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.209
JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE I THINK

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.778
THEY HAVE BEEN -- ACTUALLY VERY

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:35.579
SUPPORTIVE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.381
THIS BILL -- AND HAVE BEEN ABLE

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:38.816
TO OFFER SOME GOOD COUNSEL IN

00:38:38.883 --> 00:38:40.484
TERMS OF HOW YOU WOULD PUT

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:45.189
TOGETHER PARTICULAR --

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.023
CURRICULUM.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.191
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:48.592
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THE BILL IS

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:51.862
NOT ABOUT SORT OF PLACING BLAME

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.431
WERE HAVING A GOTCHA.

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:55.399
WITH REGARDS TO JUDGES AND

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:56.834
LAWYERS BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO

00:38:56.901 --> 00:38:58.769
DO THAT AND PUT FOLKS ON DISPLAY

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.438
I THINK YOU WOULD SEE ON THE

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.373
EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT OF WHAT WE

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.474
WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WITH THIS

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:04.041
BILL.

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:06.410
BUT IT'S IN THE QUIET SPACES --

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.045
YOU KNOW IN THE OFFICES IN THE

00:39:08.112 --> 00:39:11.449
TRAINING IN THE WORK -- WELL IN

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:14.018
THE THE THE WORK SPACES BEHIND

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.486
CLOSED DOORS WERE FOLKS WILL

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.821
HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO HAVE HONEST

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:18.723
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT M. C.

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:19.857
ELLIE IS ALSO A VERY GOOD

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:28.272
ACCORDING TO PUBLIC RECORDS

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:28.872
JOHNSON CONTINUES TO WORK FOR

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.340
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:32.242
MAKES 40% MORE THAN THE DAY WHEN

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:33.577
HE ATTACKED ME.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:35.379
THE RETALIATION AGAINST ME

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:36.647
HOWEVER IS CONTINUED I WAS

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.548

HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.125
THE CHP PRESSURED ME TO SETTLE

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:49.359
THE CASE.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.727
AND THEY WERE ADAMANT THAT I BE

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:53.597
FORCED TO RESIGN.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:54.631
I DID NOT WANT TO RESIGN.

00:48:54.698 --> 00:48:56.033
I LOVE MY JOB AND THE FRIENDS I

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.734
HAVE.

00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.469
THE MORE I PUSH AGAINST SETTLING

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:01.505
BY RESIGNING THE MORE THE GROSS

00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:02.005
SO THEY GOT.

WITH ME AND MY FAMILY AND

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:04.574
FRIENDS.

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.910
I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY INTEND

00:49:06.977 --> 00:49:08.145
TO DEPOSE FAMILY.

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:09.379
FRIENDS GOING BACK TO MY

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:13.216
CHILDHOOD.

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:14.985
ALL I EVER WANTED WAS TO BE

00:49:15.052 --> 00:49:18.522
PROTECTED FROM JONES.

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:19.956
AND TO SEE IF PEOPLE CLEAR THAT

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:21.358
WAS NEVER AN OPTION.

00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:22.526
AS PART OF MY SETTLEMENT I WAS

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:23.660
FORCED TO AGREE TO A NO REHIRE

00:49:23.727 --> 00:49:25.295
PROVISION MEANING I COULD NO

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:26.697
LONGER WORK FOR THE C. H. P. OR

DIVISIONS.

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:30.967

HAVE TOLD ME THEY WILL NEVER

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:46.450
REPORT FROM FEAR WHAT THEY WILL

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.552
LOSE THEIR JOBS AS I DID.

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:50.320
IT IS UNFAIR THAT THE ADMITTED

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:52.022
HELP SEXUAL AROUSAL CONTINUES TO

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:53.390
WORK FOR THE STATE RECEIVING

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:55.559
PROMOTIONS AND RAISES WHILE I

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:56.760
EMPLOYMENT WITH.

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:58.762
SIMPLY BECAUSE I ASKED TO BE

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:00.464
PROTECTED FROM HARASSMENT.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.498
THIS IS NOT A HE SAID SHE SAID

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:03.700
SITUATION HE FREELY ADMITTED TO

ALL OF HIS ACTIONS.

00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:07.070
AND HE DID NOT SEEM TO BE

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:08.405
EMBARRASSED OR ASHAMED.

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.806
REQUIRING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:11.808
HARASSMENT TO RESIGN AND AGREE

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:14.010
TO NEVER BE REHIRED IS THE

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:15.078
ULTIMATE FORM.

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:17.848
OF INSTITUTIONAL RETALIATION.

00:50:17.914 --> 00:50:18.782
THANK YOU.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:20.450
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND

00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:21.518
I THINK YOU'RE.

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:23.920
PART OF THE REASON WE'RE HERE.

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:26.523
AT LEAST ON THIS BILL I IF YOU

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.891
COULD BE BRIEF REFLECTION AND

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:28.859
MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE

00:50:28.925 --> 00:50:29.993
COMMITTEE JESSICA STANDER ON

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.762
BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.463
PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL --

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.098
ESSENTIALLY THE QUESTION HERE IS

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:36.266
THAT THESE CLAUSES IT BECOMES

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.634
SURREPTITIOUSLY VERY COMMON AND

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.935
PRETTY STANDARD IN ALL

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:39.469
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS FOR

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.204
WORKPLACE VIOLATIONS.

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:42.172
AND THE QUESTION IS WHY DO

00:50:42.239 --> 00:50:43.640
EMPLOYERS NEED TO INCLUDE THESE

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.609
&lt;c.green&gt;ROAD NO REHIRE CLAUSES AND ALL&lt;/c&gt;

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:46.877
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:47.911
THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:49.679
THEM TO PROHIBIT AN EMPLOYEE

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.081
WHO'S WHO'S DONE SME HARM OR

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:52.516
ENGAGE IN SOME MISCONDUCT FROM

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.518
BEINGREHIRED HOWEVER THEY DON'T

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:55.952
NEED A NO REHIRE CLAUSE IN A

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:56.953
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO TO

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:58.255
ACCOMPLISH THAT TASK.

00:50:58.321 --> 00:50:59.790
THEY CAN SIMPLY REFUSED TO

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:00.857
REHIRE THEM AND HAVE A VALID

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:02.225
CLAIM FOR WIDE ARAMBULA

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.994
JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY THEY

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.362
FAILED TO REHIRE THEM OR DENIED

00:51:05.429 --> 00:51:06.329
THEM RE HIGHER.

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.330
SO THE REASON WHY THEY ARE

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:08.465
IMPOSING ALL SETTLEMENT

00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:09.800
AGREEMENTS ARE VIRTUALLY ALL IS

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.234
THAT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO GET

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.537
AROUND OUR ANTI RETALIATION LAWS --

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:14.971
AND NOT RE HIRE SOMEONE SIMPLY

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:16.606
BECAUSE HERE SHE SPOKE OUT ABOUT

00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.308
A WORKPLACE RIGHT VIOLATION WE

00:51:18.375 --> 00:51:19.376
KNOW THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.677
ACTUALLY WANT TO RE HIRE SOMEONE

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:21.611
WHO'S SPOKEN OUT ABOUT THEIR

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:22.379
RIGHTS.

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:23.413
AND THIS TYPE OF NO REHIRE

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.815
CLAUSE REALLY INSULATES THEM

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:26.049
FROM ANY TYPE OF RETALIATION

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:27.784
CLAIM FOR FAILING TO RE HIRE

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:28.919
SOMEONE WHO HAS FILED SUCH A

00:51:28.985 --> 00:51:30.720
COMPLAINT OR CLAIM -- THESE

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:31.788
CAUSES REALLY HAVE NO LEGAL

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:33.323
PURPOSE BUT TO INSULATE

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.392
EMPLOYERS FROM LIABILITY -- FOR

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.927
RETALIATION FROM SOME AGAIN

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:38.428
SOMEONE WHO'S FILED A CLAIM AND

00:51:38.495 --> 00:51:39.896
REALLY ARE UNNECESSARY AS THEY

00:51:39.963 --> 00:51:41.331

RIGHT NOW UNDER THIS PROPOSAL

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:04.307

ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT HOWEVER

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:35.739
WHAT THIS DOES IS CHANGE THE

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:40.710
DYNAMIC IN THE CAUSE OF ACTION

00:54:40.777 --> 00:54:42.245

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.450
PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

00:55:20.517 --> 00:55:22.352
AUTHOR -- I THOUGHT THAT THE

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.220
ANALYSIS DID A GOOD JOB GOING

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:26.056
THROUGH THE INTRICACIES OF THE

00:55:26.122 --> 00:55:27.657
EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP AT ISSUE

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.559
HERE I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH

00:55:29.626 --> 00:55:31.061
THE BILL IS ADDED OVER PLEADS

00:55:31.127 --> 00:55:31.995

THAT APPLIES TO EVERY FORM OF

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:34.931
DISPUTE.

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.067
ANY COMPLAINT OF AN EMPLOYMENT

REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL OR NOT

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:46.609
THESE ARE USUALLY HIGHLY

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:48.545
NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS AND THIS

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.880
WOULD OVERRIDE THE DECISION OF

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:53.283
OF BOTH SIDES COUNSEL TO ENGAGE

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:56.686
IN THE AGREEMENT -- IT IS NICE

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.455
TO CLARIFY THAT NOTHING IN THE

00:55:58.521 --> 00:56:01.157
BILL REQUIRES RE HIGHER BUT AS

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:02.592
MS BARRERA NOTED IT SHIFTS THE

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:04.627
DEBATE FOR WHY WE DIDN'T RE HIRE

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:08.631
THE EMPLOYEE OFTEN THIS IS.

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:10.266
FAIRLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:12.368
WHERE BOTH SIDES WANT TO END THE

00:56:12.435 --> 00:56:14.204
EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP THERE'S

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:15.605
AGREEMENT NOT TO REHIRE.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:18.308
INTERESTING THAT THE EXAMPLES

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.310
THAT WE WERE GIVEN -- SO FAR I'M

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:23.413
SURE THEY HAPPEN IN THE PRIVATESECTOR BUT THEY'RE PREDOMINATELY

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.249
PUBLIC SECTOR -- EXAMPLES SO WE

00:56:26.316 --> 00:56:27.450

IN.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.102

NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT TO INCLUDE

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.906

THEY DON'T WANT TO RETURN.

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:31.834
THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:34.304
MONEY ON THE TABLE.

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.972
THE EMPLOYER DOESN'T KNOW IF

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:38.441
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO OFFER THEM

00:59:38.508 --> 00:59:39.876
THAT THE COURT MAY BE IS.

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:43.813
WHAT WOULD REQUIRE REEMPLOYMENT?

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.315
BUT THE PLAINTIFF MAY BE ABLE TO

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:46.616
SECURE.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.284
SOMETHING THAT IS OF GREATER

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.620
INTEREST TO THEM IT WOULD AND

00:59:50.687 --> 00:59:51.854
WE'RE TRYING NOT NECESSARILY

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.056
TAKE LEVERAGE AWAY FROM THE

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.157
PLAINTIFFS.

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:55.625
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THESE

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:57.026
NO REHIRE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN

00:59:57.093 --> 00:59:58.328
USED.

00:59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.997
THERE USED MORE.

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:02.198
AGREE JUST LEAVE THAN

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.634
BENEFICIALLY IN THAT STANDPOINT

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:07.637
SO TO MISTER BELOW ITS POINT.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:09.372
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE SORT OF

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.040
OVER SUBSCRIBING THIS AND IF YOU

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.875
LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF HOW THESE

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:15.044
THINGS HAVE COME INTO SETTLEMENT

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.479
AGREEMENTS AND THEY'RE OFTEN

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:16.913
PITCH SAID.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.581
I'VE BEEN ON DIRTY ON THE INSIDE

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:20.016
ON THESE ON THESE QUESTIONS

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.417
THEY'RE SORT OF PITCHED AS THIS

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.219
IS A STANDARD FORM AGREEMENT WE

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.954
WANT.

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.689
TO JUST PUT YOU IN THE SAME

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:27.957
POSITION AS EVERYONE ELSE.

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:30.059
THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A LOT OF

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.527
CHOICE GIVEN.

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.629
THAT'S WILL WORKING AGAINST I AM

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:37.433
SENSITIVE TO POTENTIALLY.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.135
I AM POTENTIALLY TRYING TO GO A

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.137
LITTLE BIT FURTHER THEN MAYBE WE

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:43.072
NEEDED TO AYE I DON'T WANT TO GO

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:44.607
OVERLY BROAD ON THIS.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:45.975
BUT I WORRY THAT IF WE RESTRICT

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:47.110
THIS A LOT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:48.878
FACILITATING THE KINDS OF

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:49.178
AGREEMENTS.

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:52.081
AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT THAT HAVE

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.417
BEEN DEVELOPING IN THE PAST AND

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.185
AGAIN THESE ARE VICTIMS REALLY

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:57.653
BEING RE VICTIMIZED.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.756
THAT IF THE VICTIM WANTS TO

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:01.357
LEAVE AND GETS A SETTLEMENT

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.426
AGREEMENT THERE'S NO OBLIGATION

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.627
FOR THEM TO COME BACK WE WE

01:01:04.694 --> 01:01:05.795
UNDERSTAND THAT SITUATION BUT

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:06.963
REALIZE.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.964
TOO THAT WITH A LOT OF COMPANIES

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:09.399
WITH A LOT OF PUBLIC AGENCIES

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:10.466
THAT ARE MENTIONED.

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:12.402
THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF RELATED

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.604
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE THEN OFF

01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.806
THE TABLE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.141
THAT THEY MAY NOT REALIZE.

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:19.842
YES ITS COMPLEXITIES EMPLOYMENT

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:21.944
RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY COMPLEX

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:23.212
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO JUST TAKE

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.081
A A TOOL OFF THE TABLE THAT HAS

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:27.283
BEEN MISUSED MORE THAN IT'S BEEN

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.085
BENEFICIALLY USE.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.421
AND RE BALANCE THAT PLAYING

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:33.122

YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT TO THEM

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:37.360
I JUST WANTED AND WE WERE

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.795
GENERALLY REPRESENT LOW WAGE

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:40.163
WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE ANY

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:41.464

NEGOTIATE ANY KIND OF HIGHER

COMPENSATION.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.238

REQUIRED TO TAKE IT ON A TAKE IT

AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER SOME POINTED

BREADTH OF THE AND THE SCOPE OF

THESE PROVISIONS AND BELIEVE IT

01:01:58.314 --> 01:01:59.348
MAY JUST BE FOR THAT ONE

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.817
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYER AND THEN

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:01.784
COME TO FIND LATER WHEN THEY

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.386
APPLY FOR A JOB AT WHAT SEEMS TO

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:04.353
BE A SEPARATE.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.788
ENTITY THAT THEY'RE NOW BARRED

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:06.923
FROM EMPLOYMENT IN A VARIETY OF

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.925
OTHER CONTACTS THAT THEY HADN'T

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:09.525
EVEN UNDERSTOOD WOULD BE THE

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.827
CASE.

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:11.994
THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL MEN

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.063
WITH RESPECT TO LEAST ONE A

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.533
CONCERNS OF OF THE OPPONENTS --

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.203
NOTHING THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.938
TERMINATION OF A BAD ACTOR WHO'S

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:24.040
BEEN THE PERPETRATOR OF SEXUAL

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.042
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION IN

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.777
THE WORKPLACE IS THAT CORRECT

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:29.212
THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:30.446
NOW THE TERMS OF THIS WOULD

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.414
STILL APPLY.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.616
BY COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITIES

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.418
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY'RE

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:40.423
AWARE OF THE POOLS AND AND GIVEN

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:41.891
THEM THE STATE OF EMPLOYMENT LAW.

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:42.859
POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES ARE OFTEN

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:44.360
VERY HIGHLY THAT SO THEY ARE

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.027
ABLE TO KEEP A RECORD THEY THEY

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.229
KNOW WHO THEY SHOULD NOT BE RE

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:46.796
HIRING.

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:49.866
AND SO THE THE COMMENT ABOUT.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.033
CREATING AND I DON'T THINK THIS

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.135
IS GOING TO CREATE ADDITIONAL

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.569
LITIGATION THAT THAT THE FEARS

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:56.038
RUN BECAUSE THAT RETALIATORY SO

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:56.906
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SEPARATED

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:58.407
SOMEBODY WHO'S A BAD ACTOR HAS

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.042
BEEN SEPARATE FROM COMPANY.

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.678
AND THEN APPLIES BACK THAT THE

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:05.648
NEXUS TO THE ORIGINAL CLAIM THAT

01:03:05.715 --> 01:03:07.850
GOT THEM DISMISSED OR NEGOTIATED

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.919
DISMISSAL OR OR LEFT THE COMPANY

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:11.821
IS BROKEN ONCE THEY'RE NO LONGER

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:12.288
HIGHER.

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:14.157
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:16.092
TO MAKE A RETALIATION CLAIM FOR

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.560
THE FACT OF THEM NOT GETTING

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.495
HIRED WHEN THE COMPANY IS.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.063
FREE TO JUST SAY YOU'RE NOT

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.665
WE'RE NT GOING TO HIRE YOU.

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:24.167
AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN WHEN

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:24.834
COMMITTEES ASIDE NOT TO HIRE

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.636
SOMEBODY OR PUBLIC AGENCIES IS

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:27.537
THE CASE.

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.071
THEY'RE NOT EXPLAINING MUCH THEY

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.640
DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN MUCH WE'RE

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.108
NOT ASKING THEM TO EXPLAIN MUCH.

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:33.676
BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:34.644
REQUIRING THEM TO BE HEARD BACK

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.345
YET SO I THINK THE HIRING

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.814
ORGANIZATION BE A PUBLIC AGENCY

01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:39.382
A PRIVATE AGENCY.

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:41.684
HAS PLENTY OF TOOLS TO MAKE SURE

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:42.451
THAT THEY'RE NOT BRINGING A BAD

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.220
ACTOR BACK INTO THE K. INTO

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:46.389
THEIR FOLD WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.525
WHAT WE DO NOT WANT AND I WOULD

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.593
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.161
BUT ON BALANCE HOW THESE CLAUSES

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:54.330
HAVE BEEN USED I THINK WE'RE

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:55.998

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.448
NOTHING PREVENTS THE EMPLOYER

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.783
FROM SHARING THE EVIDENCE.

01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:16.419

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.128
WE'RE KIND OF SPARSE AT THIS

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.531
POINT -- LECTURE WAS GOING TO

01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:31.567
FOLLOW UP WITH THE WITH HIS HIS

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.202

STERN RE HIGHER AND FOR THE

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:44.647
REASONS THAT HE JUST MENTIONED.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:48.951
IS NOT HIRED -- IS THAT

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.553
DISCOVERABLE INFORMATION.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.021
THE THE PAST HISTORY

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:55.958
[inaudible] EIGHT POTENTIALLY

01:04:56.025 --> 01:04:57.727
YEAH A SORT OF DEPENDS ON WHO

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.795
THE PARTS OF THEIR GOING BACK TO

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.998
THE SAME COMPANY -- YEAH I WOULD

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:03.366
I WOULD THINK IF IF THEY'RE

01:05:03.432 --> 01:05:04.867
TRYING TO MAKE A DISCRIMINATION

01:05:04.934 --> 01:05:06.035
CLAIM.

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:07.370
BUT IN TALKING TO THE EMPLOYMENT

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.605
LAWYERS MOST OF THEM IT'S IT'S

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.240
NOT A CLAIM THAT LAWYERS WOULD

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:12.341
NECESSARILY TAKE ON BECAUSE

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:13.609
AGAIN THE BE MAKING A

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.811
DISCRIMINATION CLAIM FOR THE

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:18.781
CURRENT NON HIGHER DECISION.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.182
THAT REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO.

01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:21.651
THE DEAD HAS BROKEN THEIR NEXUS

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:24.120
WITH THE THE REASON FOR THE

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:25.354
TERMINATION.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.189
SO THE EMPLOYER COULD SAY.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.191
YOU ARREST OR ANY INTERNALLY

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:30.693
MAKE THAT.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.461
MAKE THAT DETERMINATION THIS IS

01:05:32.528 --> 01:05:33.629
NOT THE KIND OF A CANDIDATE WE

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.665
WANT TO HIRE AND THEY HAVE THOSE

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:36.766
RECORDS THEY COULD BE ABLE TO DO

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:37.066
THAT.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.001
SO THEN IF THAT POTENTIAL

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:40.670
EMPLOYEE DID SU.

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:41.704
THEN GET THERE THROUGH THE

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.307
DISCOVERY PROCESS THEY MAY THEN

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:46.208
GET ACCESS TO THEIR PRIOR

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.843
EMPLOYMENT RECORD.

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:48.911
AS LONG AS THE COMPANY HAD

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:50.913
DOCUMENTED THE REASON FOR THAT

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.082
DETERMINATION AND WHAT HAD

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.717
HAPPENED IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE I

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.319
WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BOLSTER.

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.354
YOUR CRIMINALS HIGHER SO --

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.456
THERE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:03.426
HAVE AGREED TO YES OUT.

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.927
WAS THIS A RECENT.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.128
EVENT IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.596
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT LONGER

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.198
THAN THAT NOTE THE IS IS IT WAS

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:10.733
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OR WITHIN

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.134
THE LAST WEEK IN WORKING WITH

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.135
THE COMMITTEE GUY.

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:14.170
SO I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF THEM

01:06:14.236 --> 01:06:17.373
WHICH SUBSECTION BEING.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.009
NOTHING EN SUBDIVISION SHALL

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.044
REQUIRE AN EMPLOYER TO CONTINUE

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:23.746
TO EMPLOYER HIGHER PERSON WHEN

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:24.680
THERE'S A LEGITIMATE NON

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:26.215
DISCRIMINATORY.

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:27.917
OR NON RETALIATORY REASON FOR

01:06:27.983 --> 01:06:29.085
TERMINATING THE EMPLOYMENT

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.386
RELATIONSHIP.

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:32.722
OR REFUSING TO RE HIRE THE

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:34.223
PERSON CORRECT AND WE AND WE I

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:37.093
THINK THAT THE THAT THE BILL.

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:38.728
THAT THAT'S A CLARIFICATION I

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:40.596
THINK THE WE WERE SILENT ON THAT

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:42.631
I DON'T THINK WE SET UP ANY

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.866
OBLIGATION TO REHIRE OR

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.234
INTERFERE WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.169
BUT BASED ON SOME OF THE

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:48.237
CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED.

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:49.672
WE'RE PUTTING THESE PROVISIONS

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:50.539
AND HAVING WORK WITH THE

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:52.408
COMMITTEE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:54.009
THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.411
INTERRUPT THE ABILITY THE

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.780
COMPANY TO NOT REHIRE. FOR THE

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.115
THEY COULD ENTER INTO AN

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.850
AGREEMENT WITH AS AN EMPLOYEE

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.318
ESPECIALLY THE BAD ACTOR TO

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.519
SEPARATE [inaudible]

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.521
OKAY.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.856
AND NOTHING IN THE SUBDIVISION

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:08.424
NOTHING IN THIS SHOP PRECLUDE

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:09.725
THE EMPLOYER AND AGREE PERSON

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.660
FROM MAKING AN AGREEMENT TO END

01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:12.728
A CURRENT EMPLOYMENT

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.530
RELATIONSHIP.

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.098
CORRECT AND AND THAT WAS BECAUSE

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.934
WE WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE CLEAR

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.336
WAS THAT IF THERE IS A BAD ACTOR

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:22.371
AND THAT ORGANIZATION WANTS TO

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:23.806
TERMINATE THAT BAD ACTOR THAT

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:24.673
COULD BE DONE THROUGH A

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.442
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IF YOU WELL

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.210
THEY THEY COULD AGREE. TO PART

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:29.912
WAYS WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:07:29.979 --> 01:07:31.247
THAT STILL COULD HAPPEN OR NOT

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.048
INTERFERE WITH THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:07:33.115 --> 01:07:35.584
WE'RE REALLY MORE FOCUSED ON THE

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.385
REHIRE PROVISION TO OF THE NO

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:37.753
REHIRE PROVISION.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.655
THAT WOULD NOT BE EVEN FOR A BAD

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:40.756
ACTOR.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.258
THAT WOULD NOT BE A PART OF

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.759
THEIR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BUT

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.294
THEY COULD CERTAINLY SETTLE THEY

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.362
COULD CERTAINLY.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:21.363
ACTUALLY SOMETIMES THE COMMUNITY

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.330
PLANS IS EVEN MORE GRANULAR AND

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:23.899
A LARGE CITY LIKE LOS ANGELES

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.300
THEIR GENERAL PLAN IS BUILT ON

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.601
THIS YEAR IS NETWORK OF

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.036
COMMUNITY PLANS THAT ARE

01:18:28.103 --> 01:18:29.471
ACTUALLY DEVELOPED WITH THE

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:29.771
COMMUNITY.

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:31.273
IN A CALL OVER A COURSE OF YEARS

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:32.974
TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT AREAS

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.176
THEY WANT TO UPS OWN WHERE THEY

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.243
WANT TO DOWN ZONE WHERE THEY

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:36.812
WANT THEIR DEVELOPMENT TO BE.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.146
A CITY OF GLENDALE SPENT WHEN I

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.481
WAS ON THE COUNCIL MANY YEARS

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.682
DEVELOPING THEIR SOUTHLAND A

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:42.684
COMMUNITY PLAN WHICH IS A VERY

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:43.285
IN DEPTH DOCUMENT THAT THINK

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:44.453
IT'S FOLDED INTO THE GENERAL

01:18:44.519 --> 01:18:45.887
PLAN BUT IT'S THE PLAN THAT

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:47.856
GOVERNS THAT COMMUNITY.

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:48.523
AND THE REASON WHY WE'VE OR WERE

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:49.591
TAKING THIS APPROACH IS BECAUSE

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.193
IT'S THE GENERAL PLAN LEVEL

01:18:51.259 --> 01:18:52.627
THAT'S BEING SUED I'M IN THE

THERE ARE.

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:57.566

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:02.871

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:03.772
OKAY SO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:06.174

DEBT HAS BEEN DEEMED I'M

01:29:52.754 --> 01:29:54.789

AND THE SECOND THING IS THIS

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:07.468
