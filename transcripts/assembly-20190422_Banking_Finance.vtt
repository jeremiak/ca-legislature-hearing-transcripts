STATE CHARTERED BANKS.

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.089
I CONTEND THAT MOST OF THEM ARE

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.323
PROBABLY CREDIT UNIONS AND THEY

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.558
ARE REGULATED BY THEIR OWN

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.293
FEDERAL REGULATORS.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:50:01.164
CREDIT UNIONS ARE MOSTLY -- TO

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:03.233

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:16.413
SOME SOME VALUE IS ABOUT THAT OF

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.181
A TO TRACK DOWN THE ACTIVITIES

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:21.651

NINE FOR FIVE A MEASURE WHICH

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:54.397
WOULD ALLOW ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.599
TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THEIR

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:56.733

RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS THIS BILL

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:04.007
DOESN'T REQUIRE ENTITIES TO DO

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.508
SO PROVIDES THEM WITH AN OPTION

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:06.643
CURRENT LAW PLACES MANY

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:08.211
RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.913

HIGHER RISK TO THE LOCAL AGENCY.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.591
THE BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF

00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:23.193
THESE RESTRICTIONS BUT SIMPLY

00:54:23.259 --> 00:54:24.561
INCREASES THE AMOUNT.

00:54:24.628 --> 00:54:27.897

WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL AGENCIES.

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.045

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:40.727
ADDITIONALLY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:42.829
THE UNNECESSARY RISK TO TAXPAYER

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.264
DOLLARS THAT THIS CREATES.

01:46:44.331 --> 01:46:45.565
THERE ARE MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT

01:46:45.632 --> 01:46:46.900
WERE COMMISSIONED BY DIFFERENT

01:46:46.967 --> 01:46:48.201
MUNICIPALITIES AROUND THE STATE

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.669
INTO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.805
EACH RECOMMENDED AGAINST A STATE

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:53.306
OR MUNICIPAL RUN BANK.

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:55.242
AND FORECASTED SUSTAINED LOSSES

01:46:55.308 --> 01:46:57.611
ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO THIRTY

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:58.779
YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.

01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.413
SO IN CONCLUSION I BELIEVE THAT

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.448
THE BANKING INDUSTRY IS DOING A

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:02.916
GREAT JOB OF MEETING THE NEEDS

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:04.251

WONDERFUL DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE.

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:16.263

THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS

01:48:20.627 --> 01:48:21.561
FOR WORKING TOGETHER ON WHAT I

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:22.529
THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.030
AMENDMENTS I THINK.

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:24.965
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:26.533
DO AS A COMMITTEE AND IS ENSURE

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:27.567
THAT THE PUBLIC'S MONEY IS

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:29.135
SAFELY HELD IN THAT THE

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:30.103
AMENDMENTS.

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:31.838
DO THAT I THINK THAT THE D. V.

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.106
O. AND AFTER I SEE OVERSIGHT

01:48:33.173 --> 01:48:34.541
FROM CHARTER THROUGH

01:48:34.608 --> 01:48:36.576
CONTINUATION IS CRUCIAL TO THAT

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:37.777
I ALSO THINK.

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:38.879
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE IN

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:40.113
LOCAL CONTROL AND IF THE LOCAL

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.248
ENTITIES CAN SHOW THAT THEY CAN

01:48:41.314 --> 01:48:42.716
DO THIS I THINK IT MAKES SENSE

01:48:42.782 --> 01:48:45.518
TO GIVE IT TO THEM -- I ALSO SEE

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:47.053
THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN THIS I

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.255
ACTUALLY WISH SHE WOULD HAVE

01:48:48.321 --> 01:48:49.656
ALSO ADDED EDUCATION LOANS

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:50.657
SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:51.791
WORK TOWARD LOWER INTEREST

01:48:51.858 --> 01:48:53.126
EDUCATION ONCE IT'S SOMETHING

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.928
OUR STUDENTS DEEPLY NEED -- BUT

01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:56.162
I DO HAVE A QUESTION I'M

01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:57.364
CONCERNED WITH.

01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:59.099
THE FISCAL IMPACT ON OUR GENERAL

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:01.801
FUND OF HAVING OUR MONEY MOVE

01:49:01.868 --> 01:49:04.204
INTO PUBLICLY HELD BANKS THAT

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:06.172
ARE NOT TAXED.

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:07.641
SO WE'RE TAKING THE MONEY OUT OF

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:09.109
BANKS IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY

01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:10.977
PAY STATE TAXES AND PUTTING THEM

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:12.846
INTO BANKS THAT WOULD NOT PAY

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:13.813
STATE TAXES NOT COULD

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.515
POTENTIALLY HIT THE GENERAL FUND

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:17.384
I UNDERSTAND THE RE THE BENEFITS

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:18.785
FINANCIAL BENEFITS BUT THAT

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:20.287
SEEMS LIKE A FINANCIAL RISK. TO

01:49:20.353 --> 01:49:23.590
OUR STATE FUND OF DOING THIS YOU

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:24.624
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT.

01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:25.258
I THINK MY FIRST REACTION IS IF

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:26.426
YOU HAVE PUBLIC MONIES THE IDEA

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:28.428
OF TAKING PUBLIC MONIES THAT ARE

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:29.996
ALREADY TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THE

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:31.431
TAXING THEM AGAIN MEANS YOU'RE

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:32.866
HITTING THAT MONEY TWICE.

01:49:32.933 --> 01:49:34.567
I APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE

01:49:34.634 --> 01:49:36.770
BUT A BIT AGAIN.

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:38.538
THE IDEA OF SAYING THAT BILLIONS

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:40.240
OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONIES

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:43.076
OUGHT TO BE TAXED AGAIN THROUGH

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:44.978
THE BANKING SYSTEM.

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:47.414
YES ON THE ONE HAND IT WILL HAVE.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.515
IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

01:49:48.581 --> 01:49:50.183
GENERAL FUND DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.785
LEVEL OF FUNDING A LOCAL

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.887
JURISDICTION CHOOSES TO SPEND ON

01:49:53.954 --> 01:49:56.589
IT BUT BUT I THINK A ALLOWING IN

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:58.358
A JURISDICTION TO HANG ON TO AS

01:49:58.425 --> 01:49:59.726
MUCH OF THE TAXPAYER FUNDS THAT

01:49:59.793 --> 01:50:00.727
ARE IN ITS BANK.

01:50:00.794 --> 01:50:03.430
I THINK IT'S ALSO A BENEFIT THAT

01:50:03.496 --> 01:50:08.134
WE SHOULD WE SHOULD BALANCE OUT.

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:08.702
NUMBER SAN DIEGO YEAH AND I

01:50:08.768 --> 01:50:09.836
THINK I THINK THERE'S A BENEFIT

01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:11.404
THE SAVING THE DOLLARS RATHER

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:14.207
THAN THAN -- THAN HAVING A

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:16.376
PRIVATE ENTITY INVEST THOSE

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:17.210
DOLLARS FOR THAT BENEFIT AS

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.111
OPPOSED.

01:50:18.178 --> 01:50:19.546
TO A COMMUNITY BANK INVESTING

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:21.081
DOLLARS FORTY COMMUNITIES

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:22.816
BENEFITS I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:24.884
OFFSET BUT LET ME ALSO SAY

01:50:24.951 --> 01:50:26.987
SOMETHING.

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:27.587
THAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT POOR

01:50:27.654 --> 01:50:28.722
LOCAL CONTROL FUNNY WHAT BETTER

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:30.290

GRAPPLED WITH.

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:40.460
AN OVER THE YEARS AND YOU SEE

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.327

THE CURRENT -- IT FEDERAL

01:51:44.130 --> 01:51:45.665
MINISTRATION AND I THINK WHAT A

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.567
LOT OF THESE THINGS HAVE DONE

01:51:47.634 --> 01:51:50.470
HAVE LED TO AN EROSION -- OF

01:51:50.537 --> 01:51:51.938
TRUST IN OUR BANKING SYSTEM

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.273
UNDER OCEAN OF TRUST IN WHERE

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:54.674

01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:06.419
A AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL --

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:07.454
WILL AIM.

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:09.522
TO HOPEFULLY BE A VEHICLE TO TRY

01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:10.924
TO BUILD BACK SOME OF THAT TRUST --

01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.925
AND I THINK IT'S A COMING UPON

01:52:11.991 --> 01:52:13.293
THIS BODY TO HAVE THOSE

01:52:13.359 --> 01:52:14.360

CENTRO WHICH I THINK IS ANOTHER

01:52:28.007 --> 01:52:29.709
EXCITING ELEMENT ABOUT THIS BANK --

COMMERCIAL BANKS.

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:36.089
SO -- A HOME.

01:56:36.155 --> 01:56:38.758
TOWN FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE IF

WE COULD ABA.

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:54.400
INITIATED A CHANGING THE

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:56.002
REGULATIONS AND RULES.

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:58.037
BUT RATHER THAN ESTABLISHING SO

01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:00.640
THESE ARE TOOL OF FIRST THE

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:03.209
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS LOOK TO HEAR

LET ME START AND ANSWER WITH A

01:58:06.212 --> 01:58:08.648
COUPLE THINGS FIRST -- WITH THE

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:10.216
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS -- IN

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:11.651
ORDER FOR LOCAL JURISDICTION TO

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:13.286
EVEN CONSIDER STARTING A CHARTER

01:58:13.352 --> 01:58:15.054
BANK YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE THE

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:16.923
COST YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE CAPITAL

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:17.790
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT FINANCIAL

01:58:17.857 --> 01:58:19.025
PROJECTIONS YOU NEED TO DO A

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:20.159
LEGAL ANALYSIS.

01:58:20.226 --> 01:58:21.561
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STEPS YOU

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:23.729
HAVE TO CONSIDER BEFORE A LOCAL

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.998
JURISDICTION -- AND AND YOU AND

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:27.033
I BOTH SERVED IN LOCAL

01:58:27.099 --> 01:58:28.634
GOVERNMENT BEFORE LOCAL ELECTED

01:58:28.701 --> 01:58:30.636
OFFICIALS WOULD EVEN CONSIDER TO

01:58:30.703 --> 01:58:31.604
TAKE THE STEP OF APPLY FOR

01:58:31.671 --> 01:58:32.138
CHARTER.

01:58:32.205 --> 01:58:33.940
ONCE A LOCAL JURISDICTION

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:35.241
DECIDES TO TAKE THAT STEP THEN

01:58:35.308 --> 01:58:36.909
IT HAS TO MEET ALL OF THE

01:58:36.976 --> 01:58:38.845
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SET UP BY

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.379
THE STATE AND WHAT THIS BILL

01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:41.981
SAYS.

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:43.416
IS WE ARE NOT PROVIDING ARE

01:58:43.483 --> 01:58:46.285
EXCEPTIONS FOR PUBLIC BANKS WITH

01:58:46.352 --> 01:58:47.453
REGARDS TO HOW THEY NEED TO

01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:48.988
CARRY OUT THEIR DUTIES THEY NEED

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:50.056
TO KEEP THE SAME COLLATERALS

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:50.890
NATION.

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:52.124
THEY HAVE TO KEEP FDIC.

01:58:52.191 --> 01:58:53.392
INSURANCE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE

01:58:53.459 --> 01:58:55.361
SAME SAFE CARDS AND THAT'S JUST

01:58:55.428 --> 01:58:57.296
TO GO THROUGH THE MULTI YEAR

01:58:57.363 --> 01:58:58.798
PERIOD JUST TO GET CHARTER.

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:00.333
ONCE YOU'RE CHARTERED STATE

01:59:00.399 --> 01:59:01.868
REGULATORS WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:59:01.934 --> 01:59:03.603
SURE ON A REGULAR BASIS THAT

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:05.037
YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:06.105
BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT I

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:08.374
WANT TO SUGGEST IF YOU THINK

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:09.141
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A BANK

01:59:09.208 --> 01:59:10.176
FAILS.

01:59:10.243 --> 01:59:11.911
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

01:59:11.978 --> 01:59:13.479
WHEN WALL STREET BANKS FAILED.

01:59:13.546 --> 01:59:15.081
THEY DESTROYED COUNTLESS JOBS

01:59:15.147 --> 01:59:17.016
WITH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:18.451
THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS

01:59:18.518 --> 01:59:19.819
PREDATORY LENDING NOT MONEY TO

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:21.854
SMALL BUSINESSES THE FAILURES OF

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:23.422
PRIVATE BANKS.

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:25.658
HAS HAD ENORMOUS AND IRREPARABLE

01:59:25.725 --> 01:59:28.227
DAMAGE TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND

01:59:28.294 --> 01:59:29.896
PART OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET

01:59:29.962 --> 01:59:31.898
LOCAL COMMUNITIES CONTROL THEIR

01:59:31.964 --> 01:59:33.032
OWN FATE.

01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:35.067
LET LOCAL COMMUNITIES TAKE THEIR

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:36.502
HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS AND

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:38.104
DETERMINE WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE

01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:39.705
TAX DOLLARS INVESTED IN THEIR

01:59:39.772 --> 01:59:41.274
COMMUNITIES ADDRESS THEIR ISSUES

01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:42.942
AS OPPOSED TO SENDING.

01:59:43.009 --> 01:59:44.677
THE MONEY TO WALL STREET AND

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:46.112
HAVING WALL STREET INVESTED IN

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:47.346
INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:48.381
DO WITH COMMUNITIES.

01:59:48.447 --> 01:59:49.849
BUT INDUSTRIES THAT MANY

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:22.615
ENTITIES SO.

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:23.549
UNDER AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN A

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:24.183
PUBLIC BANK IS A BANK

02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.818
CORPORATION TO SEPARATE LEGAL

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.987
ENTITY FROM ITS OWNER WHICH

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.488
WOULD BE THE LOCAL AGENCY.

02:00:29.555 --> 02:00:31.324
SAID THERE'S A M..

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:33.359
IN TERMS OF LIABILITY FOR THE

02:00:33.426 --> 02:00:35.027
DEBTS OF THE BANK THOSE STAY

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:36.262
WITH THE BANK AND THE BANK

02:00:36.329 --> 02:00:38.164
CORPORATION.

02:00:38.230 --> 02:00:40.132
AND AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU.

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:41.634
WAS SAYING THESE.

02:00:41.701 --> 02:00:43.669
BANKS HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS

02:00:43.736 --> 02:00:46.005
IN TERMS TERMS OF PROTECTING TAX

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:47.373
DOLLARS THAT CURRENTLY APPLIED

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:50.476
PRIVATE BANKS.

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:53.446
SO WHAT IS THE OUR RISK ANALYSIS

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:55.047
SO OF WHAT IS THE ABOLITION

02:00:55.114 --> 02:00:57.483
GUEST OF NEW SYSTEM PUBLIC

02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:58.918
BANKING SYSTEM.

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:01.754
OUR VERSUS -- THAT THE TRYING.

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:05.124
TO A CHANGE WHO ARE IMPROVE THE

02:01:05.191 --> 02:01:08.427
SERVICE AREA SAID THAT CURRENTLY --

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:10.496
OF PUBLIC BANKS ARE NOT MADE I

02:01:10.563 --> 02:01:14.066
MEAN THE COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE

02:01:14.133 --> 02:01:16.135
NOT MEETING FOR THE CLIENTS.

02:01:16.202 --> 02:01:17.403
IF I UNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:20.373
CORRECTLY IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE --

02:01:20.439 --> 02:01:22.074
YOU INVEST YOUR LOCAL DOLLARS IN

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.442
A PUBLIC BANKING YOU AND AND

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:25.578
IT'S FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD AS

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:28.280
OPPOSED TO INVESTING DOLLARS --

02:01:28.347 --> 02:01:28.881
FOR A RAID RETURN THAT WE CALL

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.817
PROFIT.

02:01:31.884 --> 02:01:36.555
AS YOU HEARD AWHILE AGO -- ALL.

02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:37.923
THE BANG SAID THAT I HAVE.

02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:39.558
WORKED WITH AYE HERE IS THAT THE

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:41.260
LOCAL BANKS -- THEY HAVE A

02:01:41.327 --> 02:01:42.862
STRONG INTEREST IN THE A

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:44.397
COMMUNITY AND THAT THEY DO

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:45.598
RETURN.

02:01:45.665 --> 02:01:46.899
THEIR BENEFITS -- AND THE

02:01:46.966 --> 02:01:48.934
PARTICIPATING IN THE COMMUNITY

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:51.037
ACTIVITIES SO IN INTO IN THE

02:01:51.103 --> 02:01:52.672
FORMS OF ON AND OFF GIVING MONEY

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:55.841
AND SPONSORING EVENTS ETCETERA

02:01:55.908 --> 02:01:57.510
LACK OF FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY

02:01:57.576 --> 02:02:02.281
MILLION DOLLARS -- THEY HALFWAY

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:05.117
INVESTED THE IN THE COMMUNITY --

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:07.353
ACTIVITIES -- SO ARE.

02:02:07.420 --> 02:02:09.188
I MEAN THERE MAY BE SOME LACKING

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:11.023
AREAS -- COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:14.360
NOT MEETING SO IF WE CAN REQUIRE -

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:16.696
THE MISSING PIECES SO FOR THEM

02:02:16.762 --> 02:02:18.164
TO STRENGTH AND NOT BY.

02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:20.666
OUR SO THAT RATHER THAN --

02:02:20.733 --> 02:02:23.402
UNKNOWN CHARTER THAT THE WE ARE

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:26.639
TRYING -- TO ESTABLISH AN AND I

02:02:26.706 --> 02:02:28.541
HEAR THAT NORTH DAKOTA EXAMPLE

02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:30.743
HALLWAYS OUT HOW IT THE THAT THE

02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:32.244
BANK IS UP.

02:02:32.311 --> 02:02:34.680
A PERFORMING WHAT I HEAR ABOUT

02:02:34.747 --> 02:02:36.082
IS THAT THAT THE SYSTEM WAS TO

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:39.051
SET UP A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND A

02:02:39.118 --> 02:02:42.188
NORTH DAKOTA -- ECONOMY IS SO

02:02:42.254 --> 02:02:44.056
I'M NOT THE POPULATION.

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:44.857
VERY FRACTION OF A CALIFORNIA

02:02:44.924 --> 02:02:48.227
LIKE A 2% SO IT IS A NOT A GOOD

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:51.030
REALLY GOOD A COMPARISON.

02:02:51.097 --> 02:02:55.000
OF THE SYSTEM AND THE NORTH --

02:02:55.067 --> 02:02:57.002
THE STATE SAYS SO FAR I KNOW

02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:58.370
THAT SUCCESSFULLY THIS A PUBLIC

02:02:58.437 --> 02:03:00.106
BANKING SYSTEM HAVE WAS

02:03:00.172 --> 02:03:02.341
SUCCEEDED SO THE RISK RISK

02:03:02.408 --> 02:03:05.211
FACTOR IS THE ABOLITION NEW.

02:03:05.277 --> 02:03:09.482
NEW SYSTEM OFFERS SAYS -- TRYING --

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:10.783
TO THAT CHANGING IN THE

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:13.486
DEMANDING COMMERCIAL BANKS

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:15.755
CURRENT THE EXISTING -- TO

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:18.991
IMPROVE THE ERA LACKING AREAS.

02:03:19.058 --> 02:03:21.160
OF THROUGH A WILL -- REGULATIONS --

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:22.261
ARE.

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:24.530
LEGISLATION SO WHETHER SOMEBODY

02:03:24.597 --> 02:03:35.274
HAS DONE THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS

02:03:35.341 --> 02:03:36.909
OF LOCKED IN.

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:37.943
I'LL ANSWER THE QUESTION AND A

02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:39.078
COUPLE HUESO LET ME BE CLEAR

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:40.045
THAT OUR BILL IS REALLY.

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:41.013
FOCUSED ON THE FACT THAT THE

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:41.814
LARGEST AND I REFER TO THEM AS

02:03:41.881 --> 02:03:43.449
WALL STREET BANKS INTERNATIONAL

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:44.216
BANKS HAVE HAVE FAILED.

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:45.050
OUR QUIBBLE IS NOT WITH CREDIT

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:45.684
UNIONS ARE QUIBBLE IS NOT WITH

02:03:45.751 --> 02:03:46.585
COMMUNITY BANKS AND THIS IS WHY

02:03:46.652 --> 02:03:47.686
WE SPECIFICALLY LEGISLATING OR

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:48.020
BILL.

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:50.122
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS WE SUPPORT

02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.589
THOSE LOCAL FINANCIAL

02:03:50.656 --> 02:03:51.490
INSTITUTION.

02:03:51.557 --> 02:03:52.658
SO IF YOU READ THE BILL

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:54.126
SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT A PUBLIC

02:03:54.193 --> 02:03:55.694
BANK WILL PARTNER WITH LOCAL

02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:57.797
INSTITUTIONS WILL CONDUCT RETAIL

02:03:57.863 --> 02:03:58.230
SERVICES WITH THOSE

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.398
CONSTITUTIONS.

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:01.967
THAT IS THE MODEL OF THE PUBLIC

02:04:02.034 --> 02:04:03.803
BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA AND WHILE

02:04:03.869 --> 02:04:04.870
YOU'RE UPS TO CORRECT THE STATE

02:04:04.937 --> 02:04:06.105
IN NORTH DAKOTA DOES HAVE A

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.673
SMALL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:09.775
WE ARE NOT PROPOSING A STATE

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:10.576
BANK WITH THIS BILL WE'RE

02:04:10.643 --> 02:04:12.077
PROPOSING THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:04:12.144 --> 02:04:14.180
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ESTABLISHING

02:04:14.246 --> 02:04:15.748
LOCAL BANKS.

02:04:15.815 --> 02:04:18.117
SO I WANTED TO MAKE MENTION THAT

02:04:18.184 --> 02:04:18.751
AND THEN ONE OTHER THING I WANT

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:19.852
TO MENTION IS.

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:21.587
WITHOUT PUBLIC BANKS OVER THE

02:04:21.654 --> 02:04:25.925
LAST. TWENTY FIVE YEARS.

02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:26.559
THE LARGEST BANKS IN THE UNITED

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:30.296
STATES BECAUSE OF THEIR OF THEIR

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:31.897
MARKET COMPETITIVENESS HAVE

02:04:31.964 --> 02:04:34.300
ESSENTIALLY KILLED 75% OF

02:04:34.366 --> 02:04:37.236
CALIFORNIA LOCAL BANKS. NINETEEN

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:37.837
NINETY FOUR THEY WERE A LITTLE

02:04:37.903 --> 02:04:38.704
UNDER FIVE HUNDRED BANKS.

02:04:38.771 --> 02:04:40.706
IN THE STATE OF IN OUR STATE

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:42.474
TODAY THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND

02:04:42.541 --> 02:04:43.676
TWENTY AND SO I AGREE WITH YOU

02:04:43.742 --> 02:04:45.077
THAT IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:46.612
TO BOLSTER THAT COMMUNITY

02:04:46.679 --> 02:04:47.613
BANKING WORLD.

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:48.714
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR

02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:50.683
US TO DO BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:04:50.749 --> 02:04:52.651
INDUSTRY HAS CANNIBALIZED ITSELF

02:04:52.718 --> 02:04:54.553
AND SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING AS WE

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:56.121
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL

02:04:56.188 --> 02:04:57.556
OUR OWN ASSETS AND I'LL JUST USE

02:04:57.623 --> 02:04:58.557
THE EXAMPLE.

02:04:58.624 --> 02:05:01.627
OF THE CITY THAT TIME FROM -- WE

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:03.629
TYPICALLY BANK ABOUT TEN BILLION

02:05:03.696 --> 02:05:05.331
DOLLARS A YEAR WITH THESE

02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:07.132
LARGEST INSTITUTIONS IF WE COULD

02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:09.702
USE THE INTEREST OFF THAT.

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:12.071
AYE AND INVESTED IN OUR IT IN IN

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:14.139
THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE -- WE

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:15.140
WOULD GET MUCH MORE BANG FOR OUR

02:05:15.207 --> 02:05:17.643
BUCK UP RATHER THAN SAYING IN IT

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.078
TOO NEW YORK INSTITUTIONS WHO

02:05:19.144 --> 02:05:20.512
INVESTED IN THE INDUSTRIES THAT

02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:21.947
THEY WANT THAT ARE NOT IN OUR

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:22.581
STATE.

02:05:22.648 --> 02:05:24.283
AND GIVE US BACK VERY LOW

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.185
INTEREST RATES WE COULD KEEP

02:05:26.252 --> 02:05:27.853
THAT MONEY IN OUR STATE KEEP

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.321
THAT MONEY IN OUR COMMUNITY AND

02:05:29.388 --> 02:05:30.489
USE IT TO INVEST.

02:05:30.556 --> 02:05:32.091
IN THOSE PARTS OF OUR

02:05:32.157 --> 02:05:33.893
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:35.327
RECEIVED AN INVESTMENT FROM

02:05:35.394 --> 02:05:36.896
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO.

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.831
THE FACT IS YOU KNOW THAT THERE

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:39.932
ARE.

02:05:39.999 --> 02:05:41.433
MANY MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.335
WHO WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:45.304
GET ACCESS TO CAPITAL THERE MANY

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:46.272
INDIVIDUALS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:47.439
TO GET MORTGAGES THERE MANY

02:05:47.506 --> 02:05:49.308
CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO

02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:51.377
GET LOANS -- THERE MANY STUDENTS

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:53.345
WHO BEEN UNABLE TO GET UP FAIR

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:54.647
STUDENT LOANS AND I CAN GO ON

02:05:54.713 --> 02:05:56.415
AND ON ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCESS

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:57.983
TO CAPITAL BUT IF THE LOCAL

02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:59.752
COMMUNITY CHOSE TO MAKE THOSE

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:01.220
INVESTMENTS LOCALLY.

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:02.121
THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFERENT%

02:06:02.187 --> 02:06:03.489
PICTURE SO IT'S ALL ABOUT AGAIN

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:04.590
LOCAL CONTROL.

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:06.625
ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO CONTROL

02:06:06.692 --> 02:06:07.893
WHERE ITS MONEY IS USED WARTS

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:10.362
MONEY IS INVESTED BUT BUT WITH

02:06:10.429 --> 02:06:12.264
THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE CHAIR

02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.666
WOMAN HAD ASKED US.

02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:16.168
FOR ENSURING THAT THE STANDARDS

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:17.436
THAT PUBLIC BANKS ARE REQUIRED

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:18.837
TO ENGAGE IN ARE THE SAME

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:21.073
STANDARDS THAT PRIVATE BANKS ARE

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:21.974
ENGAGEMENT.

02:06:22.041 --> 02:06:27.913
THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION --

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:31.317
IT IT'S ALSO REALLY COOL --

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:32.484
THOUGHT THAT THE MONEY WOULD

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:33.552
BECOME MORE AVAILABLE LOCALLY

02:06:33.619 --> 02:06:34.586
AND THE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO YOU

02:06:34.653 --> 02:06:36.021
KNOW TRADITIONALLY DID NOT HAVE

02:06:36.088 --> 02:06:38.557
A I WANT IRVINE'S MANY TO STAND

02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:40.426
IRVINE YEAH.

02:06:40.492 --> 02:06:44.296
IT IN ANY WE ARE NOT ONLY JUST --

02:06:44.363 --> 02:06:45.931
LOCAL COULD BUT IT YEAH.

02:06:45.998 --> 02:06:48.867
OUR BUT HERE LOOKING AT THE JUST

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:19.725
BECAUSE MY HOPE IS THROUGH THE

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.039
BUT ON THE OPPOSITION LIST ARE

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:35.074
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:36.842
INVESTED IN THE STATUS QUO AND

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:38.110
I'M JUST SAYING THAT FACTUALLY

02:08:38.177 --> 02:08:39.711
WE HAVE A CURRENT SYSTEM.

02:08:39.778 --> 02:08:42.681
THAT HAS BEEN FAILING BUT THE

02:08:42.748 --> 02:08:44.049
LARGEST BANKS WHO ARE

ECONOMIC INTEREST IN CONTINUING

02:08:49.588 --> 02:08:51.090
THE STATUS QUO I THINK IT'S FAIR

02:08:51.156 --> 02:08:52.357
TO SAY THAT THE VERY LENGTHY

02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:54.093

WORK FOR OUR PUBLIC THESE ARE

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.706
OUR CONSUMERS THESE ARE OUR

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:08.640
HOMEOWNERS THESE ARE OUR

02:09:08.707 --> 02:09:09.575
STUDENTS?

02:09:09.641 --> 02:09:10.542
THESE ARE OUR BUYER MENTALIST

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:11.577
WHO SEE THE MONIES THAT ARE

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:12.711
BEING INVESTED IN FOSSIL FUEL

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:13.946

REPRESENTATIVES OF WORKING MEN

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:18.183
AND WOMEN WHO SEE EVERY DAY.

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:23.555
THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT

02:09:23.622 --> 02:09:25.290
WORKING FOR THEM.

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:26.758
IS THE GENTLEMAN NOT IN A

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.560
POSITION -- CAN AT THE SOME OF

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:29.094
QUESTIONS SO.

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:29.928
WELL I LIKE TO ANSWER JUST A

02:09:29.995 --> 02:09:31.697
COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS IF I

02:09:31.763 --> 02:09:32.698
COULD -- I THINK THE COMMENT WAS

02:09:32.764 --> 02:09:33.365
MADE THAT STRUCTURALLY THE BILL

02:09:33.432 --> 02:09:35.801
IS NOT COMPETING WITH COMMUNITY

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:38.303
BANKS AND I I THAT THAT'S

02:09:38.370 --> 02:09:39.538
ABSOLUTELY NOT CORRECT -- YOU

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.373
HEARD FROM COMMUNITY BANKERS WHO

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.742
CBA ALSO REPRESENTS IN ADDITION

02:09:43.809 --> 02:09:45.811
TO LARGER INSTITUTIONS -- STATE

02:09:45.878 --> 02:09:48.380
THAT -- TAKING OF THOSE DEPOSITS

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:50.983
IMPAIRS THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:52.317
LOANS INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES.

02:09:52.384 --> 02:09:54.620
THIS BILL IS SUPPORTING THE IDEA

02:09:54.686 --> 02:09:55.687
THAT WE ARE TAKING PUBLIC

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:57.856
DEPOSITS THAT CURRENTLY ARE USED

02:09:57.923 --> 02:10:00.025
BY COMMUNITY BANKS AS A SOURCE

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:01.527
OF LIQUIDITY TO MAKE LOANS.

02:10:01.593 --> 02:10:02.594
AND PUTTING THEM INTO A

02:10:02.661 --> 02:10:04.563
GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT HAS NO

02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:06.031
RETAIL PRESENCE IN THEIR

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:07.199
COMMUNITY.

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.267
SO IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:09.835
YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVING ACCESS

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:12.070
TO CAPITAL THIS WILL ONLY MAKE

02:10:12.137 --> 02:10:13.172
THAT WORSE.

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:14.373
THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WAS

02:10:14.439 --> 02:10:15.807
BROUGHT UP WAS THE NOTION OF

02:10:15.874 --> 02:10:17.109
TAXES AND WE VERY MUCH

02:10:17.176 --> 02:10:18.644
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BEING

02:10:18.710 --> 02:10:19.311
ASKED.

02:10:19.378 --> 02:10:21.246
IF THE BILL DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT

02:10:21.313 --> 02:10:23.382
DOES IT PURPORTS TO CREATE A

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:25.651
SEPARATE CORPORATE STRUCTURED

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.953
INTO DE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:29.421
REASON WHY THAT CORPORATION

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:31.924
CAN'T PAY CORPORATE INCOME TAXES.

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:33.592
IF THE GOAL HERE IS TO HAVE A

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:34.760
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND

02:10:34.826 --> 02:10:36.395
COMPLEMENT COMMUNITY BANKING

02:10:36.461 --> 02:10:37.829
CREDIT UNIONS.

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:40.199
THEN LET'S ALLOW THE PUBLIC BANK

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:41.833
TO ALSO PAY TAXES.

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.569
TAXES ARE GOOD ARE THEY NOT THEY

02:10:43.635 --> 02:10:45.304
FIX OUR ROADS THEY HELP ARE

02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:47.439
NEEDY THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WE

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:50.842
HAVE A GENUINE CONCERN AND NEED

02:10:50.909 --> 02:10:53.645
TO HAVE GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN --

02:10:53.712 --> 02:10:55.180
FOR THE NOTION THAT THAT WHAT IS

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:57.516
NOT -- YOU KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR

02:10:57.583 --> 02:10:59.785
FOR CORPORATIONS -- IS NOT GOOD

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:01.286
FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY THAT THAT

02:11:01.353 --> 02:11:02.588
SEEMS TO US TO BE A LITTLE

02:11:02.654 --> 02:11:03.822
DISINGENUOUS.

02:11:03.889 --> 02:11:05.757
AND FINALLY I APPRECIATE

02:11:05.824 --> 02:11:08.193
ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHOES NEW FOUND

02:11:08.260 --> 02:11:10.128
ADMIRATION FROM NORTH DAKOTA IT

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:11.930
IS OFTEN USED AS A MODEL FOR

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:13.899
PUBLIC BANKING -- UNFORTUNATELY

02:11:13.966 --> 02:11:16.101
NORTH DAKOTA HAS A G. P. THAT IS

02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:18.103
THE SIZE OF A OXEN ART IT IS

02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:20.906
LITERALLY 2% OF CALIFORNIANS GDP

02:11:20.973 --> 02:11:22.641
IT LOST MONEY.

02:11:22.708 --> 02:11:23.809
IT'S PUBLIC BANK.

02:11:23.875 --> 02:11:26.111
LOST MONEY FOR TWELVE YEARS

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:29.214
BEFORE IT BEGAN MAKING MONEY.

02:11:29.281 --> 02:11:34.953
THAT'S TAX PAYER MONEY.

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:35.787
WE WILL HAVE YOU RESPOND I KNOW

02:11:35.854 --> 02:11:37.155
THAT AS A MEMBER GABRIEL ALSO

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:39.024
HAS BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY TO

02:11:39.091 --> 02:11:41.059
ASK QUESTIONS.

02:11:41.126 --> 02:11:41.994
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR

02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.595

VERY MUCH FOR THE AMENDMENTS

02:11:45.297 --> 02:11:46.932
THAT YOU -- OFFERED AND I THINK

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:48.700
THE AUTHORS FOR ACCEPTING THOSE

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:49.601
MOMENTS I THINK THAT THEY WERE

02:11:49.668 --> 02:11:50.802
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO ADD

02:11:50.869 --> 02:11:52.271
SOME REALLY STRONG PROTECTIONS

02:11:52.337 --> 02:11:54.973
FOR TAXPAYER FUNDS -- AND JUST

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:55.507
WANTED TO SHARE SOME OF MY

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:56.375
THOUGHTS AND THEN.

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:58.377
A QUICK QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS

02:11:58.443 --> 02:12:00.045
YOU KNOW I WAS -- VERY INTRIGUED

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:01.647
BY THE IDEA PUBLIC BANKING WHEN

02:12:01.713 --> 02:12:03.148
I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT -- YOU

02:12:03.215 --> 02:12:03.982
KNOW I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT

02:12:04.049 --> 02:12:05.417
OF FRUSTRATION BROADLY WITH SOME

02:12:05.484 --> 02:12:06.218
OF THE ACTORS IN THE PRIVATE

02:12:06.285 --> 02:12:08.153
BANKING SYSTEM I THINK THE IDEA

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:08.887
OF INCREASING COMPETITION AND

02:12:08.954 --> 02:12:09.655
LETTING.

02:12:09.721 --> 02:12:10.589
PUBLIC BANKS COMPETE AGAINST

02:12:10.656 --> 02:12:12.057
PRIVATE BANKS IS A GOOD IDEA I'M

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.292
IN FAVOR OF THAT TYPE OF

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:14.626
COMPETITION IN THE MARKET.

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:16.094
I WILL SAY WOULD GIVE ME SOME

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:17.529
PAUSE ON THE IDEA WAS THE JOINT

02:12:17.596 --> 02:12:19.231
INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT WE

02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:20.799
HAD AND AND IT WAS PRETTY

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:23.402
PARTICULAR I'M I'M ABOUT 90%

02:12:23.468 --> 02:12:24.536
SURE OF THIS BUT IT WAS THE CITY

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:25.737
TREASURER IN THE FROM SAN

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:26.571
FRANCISCO JOSE CISNEROS WHO CAME

02:12:26.638 --> 02:12:27.272
IN.

02:12:27.339 --> 02:12:28.840
AND REALLY -- OFFERED US A NOTE

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:30.342
OF CAUTION AND AND PRESENTED

02:12:30.409 --> 02:12:31.777
HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO.

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:33.078
SHARES A LOT OF PROGRESSIVE EYES

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:33.912
THAT I THINK THAT THE AUTHORS

02:12:33.979 --> 02:12:35.580
HAVE BUT SUGGESTED THAT THERE

02:12:35.647 --> 02:12:36.748
ARE THINGS THAT WE OUGHTA

02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:38.216
PROCEED WITH CAUTION WHEN IT

02:12:38.283 --> 02:12:39.851
COMES TO PUBLIC BANKING -- IT

02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:40.986
GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF THE

02:12:41.053 --> 02:12:42.321
FACT THAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES

02:12:42.387 --> 02:12:43.622
WHERE THEY HAVE PUBLIC BACON I

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:45.324
BELIEVE IT WAS GERMANY ACTUALLY

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:46.758
PAY NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES.

02:12:46.825 --> 02:12:47.592
MUCH OF THE PAY TO KEEP THEIR

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:49.394
MONEY IN THE BANK SO THAT THEY

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:51.596
HAVEN'T -- THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY --

02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:53.432
YOU KNOW SUCCEEDED IN THE WAY

02:12:53.498 --> 02:12:54.032
THAT I THINK SUPPORTERS THERE

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:55.000
WOULD HAVE HOPED -- AND ALSO

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:56.835
REALLY URGE DISCUSSION THAT TO

02:12:56.902 --> 02:12:57.703
THE EXTENT THAT THESE ENTITIES

02:12:57.769 --> 02:12:59.137
FAIL AND THERE ARE PROTECTIONS

02:12:59.204 --> 02:13:00.339
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TAXPAYER

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:02.607
MONEY IT'S THAT -- IS THE LOCAL

02:13:02.674 --> 02:13:04.076
JURISDICTIONS THAN IN IT AND

02:13:04.142 --> 02:13:05.110
INEVITABLY HAVE TO END UP CUT

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:06.311
WOULD END UP CUTTING SERVICES NO

02:13:06.378 --> 02:13:07.245
SERVICES MAY BE.

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:08.814
SERVICES THAT BENEFIT THE POOR

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:10.716
THE MOST VULNERABLE AND AND

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.417
REALLY HURT COMMUNITIES AND AND

02:13:12.484 --> 02:13:13.585
AND IN A WAY IN IN SOME WAYS

02:13:13.652 --> 02:13:15.053
THERE COULD BE A LOT UNINTENDED

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:16.455
CONSEQUENCES FROM PUBLIC BANK SO.

02:13:16.521 --> 02:13:18.990
I VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE.

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:20.359
YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THOSE

02:13:20.425 --> 02:13:22.361
AMENDMENTS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT --

02:13:22.427 --> 02:13:23.428
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL GO BEYOND OUR

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:24.930
CONSIDER GOING BEYOND THINKING

02:13:24.996 --> 02:13:27.766
ABOUT WHAT IS THERE -- FOR

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:28.333
PROTECTIONS IN THE PRIVATE

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.701
SECTOR NOW BECAUSE THIS IS

02:13:29.768 --> 02:13:30.669
TAXPAYER MONEY THIS IS THE

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:31.970
PEOPLE'S MONEY THIS IS THE MONEY

02:13:32.037 --> 02:13:33.805
THAT IS USED TO FIND SOME OF THE

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:35.607
MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN OUR

02:13:35.674 --> 02:13:36.274
COMMUNITIES.

02:13:36.341 --> 02:13:37.476
AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE

02:13:37.542 --> 02:13:42.914
PUBLIC TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:44.116
MONEY IS PROTECTED SO I'M GONNA

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:45.016
BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY I

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:45.584
THINK IT'S SUPPORT FOR THIS

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:46.118
CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE.

02:13:46.184 --> 02:13:46.752
BUT I DO YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE

02:13:46.818 --> 02:13:47.285
SURE THAT THIS BILL AS IT

02:13:47.352 --> 02:13:47.886
PROGRESSES THAT WE HAVE THAT

02:13:47.953 --> 02:13:49.421
CONVERSATION AND THAT WE ARE

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:50.789
PROTECTING TAXPAYER RESOURCES

02:13:50.856 --> 02:13:52.457
BECAUSE WE MAY HAVE THE BEST OF

02:13:52.524 --> 02:13:53.558
INTENTIONS BUT THEY ARE PLENTY

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:55.127
OF EXAMPLES OF OF GOOD

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:56.161
INTENTIONS GONE BAD OR WE COULD

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:56.328
END.

02:13:56.395 --> 02:13:58.130
UP HARMING EXACTLY THOSE FOLKS

02:13:58.196 --> 02:13:59.998
THAT WE ARE -- INTENDED HELPS I

02:14:00.065 --> 02:14:01.099
DON'T KNOW IF -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:14:01.166 --> 02:14:02.768
CHIU SINCE HE IS FROM YOUR CITY

02:14:02.834 --> 02:14:03.969
I TELL YOU WRITING IF YOU WANT

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:04.770
TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:06.304
COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE FROM THE

02:14:06.371 --> 02:14:08.106
CITY TREASURE BUT THOSE REALLY

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:09.674
MADE ME THINK THAT IF WE'RE

02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:10.509
GOING TO DO THIS WE NEED TO BE

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:10.675
IT.

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:13.044
DO IT THOUGHTFULLY DELIBERATELY

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:13.678
SLOWLY AND REALLY PROCEED WITH

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:14.646
CAUTION.

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:15.847
SO I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE

02:14:15.914 --> 02:14:16.782
ABOUT THE WAY APPRECIATE YOUR

02:14:16.848 --> 02:14:18.216
SUPPORT OF THIS BILL MOVING

02:14:18.283 --> 02:14:19.584
THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE AND

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:20.986
SOMETHING THAT -- MISTER

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:22.421
SANTIAGO AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT

02:14:22.487 --> 02:14:25.090
AT GREAT LENGTH IS ARE VERY

02:14:25.157 --> 02:14:28.927
PROFOUND HOPE AND DESIRE.

02:14:28.994 --> 02:14:30.061
THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE A

02:14:30.128 --> 02:14:31.663
PUBLIC BANK THAT IS CHARTER BY

02:14:31.730 --> 02:14:32.264
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:14:32.330 --> 02:14:33.331
FAILS.

02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:34.266
AND I THINK WHAT THIS COMMITTEE

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:36.334
HAS DONE IS PUT SAFEGUARDS TO

02:14:36.401 --> 02:14:38.837
ENSURE TO MAXIMIZE THE CHANCE

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:40.806
THAT THAT HAPPENS AND YOU TALKED

02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:43.208
ABOUT THE THE THE POSSIBILITY OF

02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:44.075
A CITY.

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:45.343
OF A PUBLIC BANK DOES FAIL

02:14:45.410 --> 02:14:46.978
HAVING TO CUT SERVICES WHEN I

02:14:47.045 --> 02:14:48.380
WOULD ASK PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT

02:14:48.447 --> 02:14:50.816
IS THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

02:14:50.882 --> 02:14:52.751
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS HAD

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:53.385
TO SPEND.

02:14:53.452 --> 02:14:56.421
BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF WALL

02:14:56.488 --> 02:14:57.088
STREET BANKS.

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:57.722
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORTGAGE

02:14:57.789 --> 02:14:58.423
FORECLOSURE CRISIS WHEN IT COMES

02:14:58.490 --> 02:15:00.292
TO PERPETRATE LANDING I COULD GO

02:15:00.358 --> 02:15:01.026
ON AND ON WITH THE LIST?

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:03.528
BUT BOB WE KNOW A SYSTEM THAT

02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:04.796
HAS FAILED AND WHAT WE ARE

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:06.998
SAYING IS IS THERE ANOTHER

02:15:07.065 --> 02:15:09.468
OPTION -- NOW I'VE HAD A NUMBER

02:15:09.534 --> 02:15:11.837
OF CONVERSATIONS WITH MY CITIES

02:15:11.903 --> 02:15:13.371
GREAT TREASURE JOSE CISNEROS.

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:15.207
AND THEY'RE REALLY TWO THINGS

02:15:15.273 --> 02:15:17.042
THAT I WOULD JUST NOTE ABOUT HIS

02:15:17.108 --> 02:15:18.076
PERSPECTIVE.

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:20.278
FIRST HE DOES BELIEVE THAT THERE

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:21.780
ARE VERY HIGH COST ESTIMATES OF

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:23.114
WHAT IS GOING TO TO TO STATE

02:15:23.181 --> 02:15:24.716
STARTUP THESE BANKS -- AND

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:26.117
USUALLY THOSE OUT WHAT I WOULD

02:15:26.184 --> 02:15:28.386
SAY TO THIS COMMITTEE IS EVEN IF

02:15:28.453 --> 02:15:29.788
THOSE COST ESTIMATES ARE HIGH

02:15:29.855 --> 02:15:31.690
THAT'S NOT A REASON TO SAY THAT

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:32.991
A LOCAL JURISDICTION SHOULDN'T

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:34.626
HAVE THE CHANCE. TO TRY THAT

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.161
THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.796
FOR A LOCAL COMMUNITY TO PUT A

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:39.464
BUSINESS PLAN TOGETHER THAT MAY

02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:41.266
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO START A BANK

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:42.534
WITH PROFITABILITY AND LESSEN

02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:43.768
SAY THE TWELVE YEARS THAT WAS

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:44.970
ALLUDED TO BY THE BANK OF NORTH

02:15:45.036 --> 02:15:46.304
DAKOTA AND BY THE WAY.

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:47.572
THE BANK NORTH DAKOTA'S BEEN

02:15:47.639 --> 02:15:49.541
AROUND SINCE NINETEEN NINETEEN

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:50.876
IT DID TAKE A DOZEN YEARS FOR TO

02:15:50.942 --> 02:15:53.044
GET UP TO PROFITABILITY BUT IN

02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:53.945
RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN

02:15:54.012 --> 02:15:55.313
SIGNIFICANT.

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:56.581
PROFITABILITY THAT'S THE KIND OF

02:15:56.648 --> 02:15:58.617
PROFITABILITY THAT WE'D LIKE TO

02:15:58.683 --> 02:16:04.122
BRING BACK TO CALIFORNIA AND AND

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:05.323
AND IF I CAN JUST TO CLOSE.

02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:06.625
EVEN IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO START

02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:07.826
A PUBLIC BANK IF FOR SETTING THE

02:16:07.893 --> 02:16:09.561
GROUND RULES CORRECTLY.

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:10.996
AND THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IS

02:16:11.062 --> 02:16:12.430
ABLE TO FIGURE THIS OUT WHY

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:14.533
WOULD WE NOT WANT TO ALLOW THAT

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:15.767
TO HAPPEN WHY WOULD WE NOT ALLOW

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:18.003
THAT AS AN OPTION TO THE STATUS

02:16:18.069 --> 02:16:23.208
QUO THE STATUS QUO HAS FAILED US.

02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:24.476
MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

02:16:24.543 --> 02:16:27.078
THOUGHTS.

02:16:27.145 --> 02:16:30.015
I WILL ADD THAT A THINK THAT THE

02:16:30.081 --> 02:16:31.116
WHEN WE STARTED THAT THE

02:16:31.182 --> 02:16:32.851
LEGISLATIVE YEAR WE STARTED WITH

02:16:32.918 --> 02:16:35.353
A HEARING AND IT WAS A HEARING

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:37.789
RELATED. TO TO REALLY DIFFERENT

02:16:37.856 --> 02:16:40.225
MODELS ACTUALLY OF WHAT PUBLIC

02:16:40.292 --> 02:16:42.694
BANKING COULD LOOK LIKE -- AT

02:16:42.761 --> 02:16:43.161
THAT POINT THERE WAS A

02:16:43.228 --> 02:16:44.763
CONVERSATION ABOUT A STATE BANK

02:16:44.829 --> 02:16:47.566
AS WELL AND AND I THINK AS THE

02:16:47.632 --> 02:16:50.702
CONVERSATION PROGRESSED AND AND

02:16:50.769 --> 02:16:52.671
AS THINGS PROGRESS IN OUR

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:54.439
LEGISLATURE THEY OFTEN DO SO

02:16:54.506 --> 02:16:56.441
BECAUSE OF A BILL -- IF THERE'S

02:16:56.508 --> 02:16:58.376
A BILL THERE IS A CONVERSATION --

02:16:58.443 --> 02:17:00.545
ABOUT THIS I REALLY TIED TO

02:17:00.612 --> 02:17:02.314
THINK ABOUT THIS BILL -- FROM

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:03.682
THE LANDS OF THE BANKING

02:17:03.748 --> 02:17:05.517
PERSPECTIVE AND I KNOW IN

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:07.385
TODAY'S CONVERSATION AND AND THE

02:17:07.452 --> 02:17:09.854
DIALOGUE BACK AND FORTH THERE

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:11.323
CERTAINLY HAS BEEN A A LOT OF

02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:12.924
ELEMENTS AND ELEMENTS RELATED TO

02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:15.961
LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AND I YOU

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.495
KNOW SHOULD THIS COULD BILL GET

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:19.064
OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY IT MOVES

02:17:19.130 --> 02:17:20.832
OVER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I

02:17:20.899 --> 02:17:22.100
KNOW THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:17:22.167 --> 02:17:23.868
COMMITTEE -- WILL HAVE THAT

02:17:23.935 --> 02:17:26.404
LANDS ON TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER

02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:28.707
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- ARE THE

02:17:28.773 --> 02:17:31.109
RIGHT SPACE AND WHAT KINDS OF A

02:17:31.176 --> 02:17:34.379
RISK -- AND OPPORTUNITIES --

02:17:34.446 --> 02:17:35.180
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD

02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:38.450
PRESENT BUT FROM A BANKING

02:17:38.516 --> 02:17:39.951
PERSPECTIVE -- AS I HEARD TODAY

02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:41.686
AND I'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS

02:17:41.753 --> 02:17:43.455
ENTIRE CONVERSATION THERE HAS

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:45.824
BEEN AN INTEREST TO HAVE A EQUAL.

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:48.693
UP PLAYING FIELD -- BEFORE AN

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:51.363
ENTITY AND DOING SO THE ALSO

02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:52.731
MEANS NOT JUST CREATING AN

02:17:52.797 --> 02:17:53.898
OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO THE

02:17:53.965 --> 02:17:54.899
SAFEGUARDS.

02:17:54.966 --> 02:17:57.135
UP FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS CHAIR

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:58.269
OF THIS COMMITTEE.

02:17:58.336 --> 02:18:00.138
IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT FOR ME TO

02:18:00.205 --> 02:18:03.541
UNDERSTAND HOW WE ACHIEVE THAT --

02:18:03.608 --> 02:18:05.677
AND DO SO AGAIN FROM A BANKING

02:18:05.744 --> 02:18:08.546
FLAT LANDS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY

02:18:08.613 --> 02:18:11.316
AND I THINK IT THAT BY ALLOWING

02:18:11.383 --> 02:18:12.317
THEM.

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:16.021
THE REGULATORY BARRIERS BARRIERS.

02:18:16.087 --> 02:18:16.855
FOR TO BE THE SAME REALLY FOR

02:18:16.921 --> 02:18:19.958
BOTH PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL BANKS --

02:18:20.025 --> 02:18:21.126
WAS SOMETHING THAT.

02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:22.661
WE DON'T I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:24.329
ABOUT AND I THINK THAT THE BILL

02:18:24.396 --> 02:18:25.563
WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT.

02:18:25.630 --> 02:18:27.966
IS BEING TAKEN DOES THAT WE HAVE

02:18:28.033 --> 02:18:29.968
NOW CREATED -- THAT SIMILAR

02:18:30.035 --> 02:18:33.038
REGULATORY BARRIERS BARRIERS FOR

02:18:33.104 --> 02:18:35.540
COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC BANKS TO

02:18:35.607 --> 02:18:37.175
ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION.

02:18:37.242 --> 02:18:38.677
AS HAS BEEN SAID THIS BILL

02:18:38.743 --> 02:18:41.312
DOESN'T CREATE A PUBLIC BANK

02:18:41.379 --> 02:18:44.082
THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR A PROCESS

02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:47.285
AT TO BE CREATED OF FOR A PUBLIC

02:18:47.352 --> 02:18:48.253
BANK.

02:18:48.319 --> 02:18:51.289
I I THINK THAT -- TO IT WILL

02:18:51.356 --> 02:18:54.392
ALSO BE IMPORTANT THAT.

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:56.161
TO WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:18:56.227 --> 02:18:57.962
WHETHER WE LIKE SOMETHING OR NOT

02:18:58.029 --> 02:19:00.131
NO ONE GETS A FREE PASS ON THIS

02:19:00.198 --> 02:19:01.433
STILL HAS TO GO.

02:19:01.499 --> 02:19:03.735
THROUGH -- THE DB OWE THE

02:19:03.802 --> 02:19:04.836
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:07.539
CHARTER APPLICATION PROCESS AND

02:19:07.605 --> 02:19:09.174
TO IT HAS FTA SEE.

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:11.710
OVERSIGHT THE FDA SEAT PORTION

02:19:11.776 --> 02:19:14.245
OF IT -- WHICH IS IMPORTANT NOT

02:19:14.312 --> 02:19:15.980
JUST TO SECURE THE PUBLIC'S --

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:18.550
FUNDING BUT ALSO THE FTA SEE

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:20.118
WORKS TO M. HE IN SUCH A WAY

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:21.786
LIKE OF A CHRIS A CRISIS

02:19:21.853 --> 02:19:23.054
MANAGEMENT TEAM IF SOMETHING

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:25.090
GOES WRONG WHAT IS THE OUTSIDE

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:26.691
ENTITY THAT WOULD COME IN TO

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:30.261
HELP -- OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:32.330
AND SO THAT ALLEN IS INCLUDED

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:33.565
HERE AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS

02:19:33.631 --> 02:19:34.999
REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:36.334
I DO THINK THAT LOCAL

02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:37.902
GOVERNMENTS AND WE'VE TALKED

02:19:37.969 --> 02:19:39.404
ABOUT CITIES AND COUNTIES BUT I

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:40.371
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE

02:19:40.438 --> 02:19:43.007
LANGUAGE HERE IS ANY KIND OF

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:44.275
LOCAL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING

02:19:44.342 --> 02:19:46.010
SPECIAL DISTRICTS COMMUNITY

02:19:46.077 --> 02:19:47.078
COLLEGE DISTRICTS.

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:48.947
BOARDS OF EDUCATION AND THAT

02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:50.715
REALLY IS WHAT THE BILL ALLOWS

02:19:50.782 --> 02:19:52.784
IT'S NOT JUST CITIES OR COUNTIES

02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:55.320
AND CLEARLY THERE ARE CAPACITIES.

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:56.721
THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OF

02:19:56.788 --> 02:20:00.191
THOSE ENTITIES SO I KNOW THAT AS

02:20:00.258 --> 02:20:01.459
THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TO LOCAL

02:20:01.526 --> 02:20:02.761
GOVERNMENT THEY WILL THINK ABOUT

02:20:02.827 --> 02:20:04.429
THAT -- TOO IT'S ONE THING TO

02:20:04.496 --> 02:20:05.730
THINK ABOUT WHAT A COUNTY OR

02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:07.265
CITY COULD DO I'M VERSES WHAT A

02:20:07.332 --> 02:20:09.334
SCHOOL YOU KNOW BOARD COULD DO

02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:11.102
AND AND THEY WOULD ALL BE

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:12.337
ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH AGAIN THIS

02:20:12.403 --> 02:20:17.041
PROCESS I THINK THE PROCESS IS

02:20:17.108 --> 02:20:19.310
RIGOROUS -- AT THE FOUNDATION

02:20:19.377 --> 02:20:19.677
THOUGH OF THIS.

02:20:19.744 --> 02:20:20.545
AND I SAID THIS IN THE IN THE IN

02:20:20.612 --> 02:20:21.045
THE HEARING.

02:20:21.112 --> 02:20:23.715
THERE HAS TO BE SOME REFLECTION

02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:25.650
ON WHY.

02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:28.286
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WANT.

02:20:28.353 --> 02:20:29.454
AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT TO WHAT'S

02:20:29.521 --> 02:20:30.922
ALREADY THERE.

02:20:30.989 --> 02:20:33.358
I WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT

02:20:33.424 --> 02:20:35.426
OUR COMMUNITY BANKS AND I KNOW

02:20:35.493 --> 02:20:36.427
MONEY SEE TO BANK AND TRUST IS

02:20:36.494 --> 02:20:38.830
HERE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE AND

02:20:38.897 --> 02:20:40.532
HELPING OUR COMMUNITY THAT THE

02:20:40.598 --> 02:20:41.733
DISTRICT I REPRESENT OF THE

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:42.700
THOMAS FIRE.

02:20:42.767 --> 02:20:44.702
I'M IN THE DEBRIS FLOW -- IN A

02:20:44.769 --> 02:20:47.172
GREAT TIME OF NEED -- WE HAD NOT

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:48.640
EXPERIENCED THAT LEVEL OF

02:20:48.706 --> 02:20:51.976
DISASTER AND NOT ONLY WERE THEY

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:53.678
THERE AT AS FINANCIAL

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:55.213
INSTITUTIONS TO HELP.

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.148
OUR COMMUNITY MOVE THROUGH THREE

02:20:57.215 --> 02:20:58.983
EMERGENCY LOANS AT THROUGH LONG

02:20:59.050 --> 02:21:00.585
TERM LOANS BUT ALSO AS

02:21:00.652 --> 02:21:02.453
VOLUNTEERS AND JUST HUMANS THAT

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:03.655
WERE TAKING CARE OF OUR

02:21:03.721 --> 02:21:06.090
COMMUNITY WHEN IT WAS REALLY

02:21:06.157 --> 02:21:06.858
REALLY DIFFICULT.

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:08.893
I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE LOST IN

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.929
THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT NOT

02:21:10.995 --> 02:21:14.432
ALL ENTITIES DO BUSINESS IN THE

02:21:14.499 --> 02:21:17.101
SAME WAY -- BUT I THINK THAT WE

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:19.003
DO HAVE TO REFLECT ON WHY THE

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:22.173
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ASKING

02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:22.607
FOR AN ALTERNATIVE.

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:24.209
PRODUCT.

02:21:24.275 --> 02:21:29.881
THE LEGISLATURE THOSE REASONS --

02:21:29.948 --> 02:21:32.250
THE LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:34.953
HANDLE AND ASSESS AND ADDRESS

02:21:35.019 --> 02:21:37.355
HOW TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE

02:21:37.422 --> 02:21:39.257
REASONS THAT THE PEOPLE OF

02:21:39.324 --> 02:21:40.825
CALIFORNIA ARE ASKING FOR AN

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:43.428
ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT -- I THINK

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:45.129
THAT THE CONVERSATION IS

02:21:45.196 --> 02:21:47.365
CERTAINLY NOT LIMITED TO THIS

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:48.466
HEARING ROOM OR TO THE

02:21:48.533 --> 02:21:49.567
LEGISLATURE I THINK THOSE

02:21:49.634 --> 02:21:50.902
CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING IN A

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:52.871
PUBLIC WAY.

02:21:52.937 --> 02:21:54.305
I DO KNOW THAT.

02:21:54.372 --> 02:21:55.707
THERE ARE BANKS WHO ARE

02:21:55.773 --> 02:21:58.343
RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS -- OF

02:21:58.409 --> 02:22:00.311
THE PUBLIC AND HEARING WHAT SOME

02:22:00.378 --> 02:22:02.146
OF THE CONCERNS ARE -- INCLUDING

02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:05.750
AB.

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.285
I MEAN THERE WAS ONE THAT.

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:08.887
DIVESTED FROM THE PA -- THE

02:22:08.953 --> 02:22:11.623
PRIVATE PRISON A SYSTEM -- IN

02:22:11.689 --> 02:22:13.458
RECENT MONTHS AND IF IT IT IT

02:22:13.524 --> 02:22:16.327
AND I WANT AS TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:21.699
THIS CONVERSATION IS. ONE ASKED

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:22.967
FOR BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:25.637
BUT TO ALSO AT NEEDED IN A WAY

02:22:25.703 --> 02:22:27.672
SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS WHAT

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:29.707
CONSUMERS ARE ASKING FOR I I

02:22:29.774 --> 02:22:31.075
THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S REALLY

02:22:31.142 --> 02:22:33.278
THE VEHICLE BUT THE ASK IS FROM

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:34.145
THE PUBLIC.

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:36.080
AND THE PUBLIC IS LOOKING FOR

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:38.016
PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MEET THEIR

02:22:38.082 --> 02:22:41.019
NEED -- AND THEY'VE IDENTIFIED

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:43.154
THAT THE PUBLIC BANK COULD BE --

02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:45.123
ONE OF THOSE AB PRODUCTS IT'S

02:22:45.189 --> 02:22:46.491
NOT LIKE A PRODUCT PER SE BUT A

02:22:46.557 --> 02:22:49.694
SYSTEM -- THAT COULD DO THAT.

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:51.796
SO I SHARE THOSE COMMENTS IT'S

02:22:51.863 --> 02:22:53.464
NOT NECESSARILY QUESTIONS I

02:22:53.531 --> 02:22:56.100
APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHORS --

02:22:56.167 --> 02:22:56.968
ENGAGEMENT IN THIS WE'VE HAD A

02:22:57.035 --> 02:22:59.237
LOT OF CONVERSATION SINCE DAY --

02:22:59.304 --> 02:23:01.639
ONE ABOUT THIS I DON'T THINK

02:23:01.706 --> 02:23:03.608
THAT ANY PART OF THIS IS

02:23:03.675 --> 02:23:05.343
NECESSARILY PERFECT BUT I DO

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:07.845
THINK THAT -- THE KID THE LENS

02:23:07.912 --> 02:23:09.213
OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS REALLY

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.382
BEEN FROM A BANKING PERSPECTIVE

02:23:11.449 --> 02:23:12.684
FROM A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS HOW DO WE

02:23:15.253 --> 02:23:17.855
ASSESS THIS -- AND THOSE COULD

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:19.791
BE DIFFERENT AS IT MOVES TO A

02:23:19.857 --> 02:23:22.093
LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- SO JUST SOME

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.695

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:43.614
DOING.

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:44.615
THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT IS IT

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:45.416
THAT IF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE

02:23:45.483 --> 02:23:47.085

CLOSE HIS I KNOW THIS IS A NEW

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:56.454
CONCEPT FOR SOME -- BUT THAT WAS

02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:59.957
TRUE FOR MANY AREAS OF

02:25:00.024 --> 02:25:01.059
GOVERNMENT.

02:25:01.125 --> 02:25:01.659
THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY

02:25:01.726 --> 02:25:02.593

WE DIDN'T HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH

02:25:03.327 --> 02:25:04.062
SYSTEM.

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:05.296
AND THEN THE PRIVATE HEALTH

02:25:05.363 --> 02:25:06.664
SYSTEM FAILED AND WE NOW HAVE A

02:25:06.731 --> 02:25:07.732
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM.

DIDN'T HAVE A PUBLIC TRANSIT

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:11.969
SYSTEM BUT THE PRIVATE TRANSIT

02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:13.438
SYSTEM FAILED AND SO THAT SYSTEM

02:25:13.504 --> 02:25:14.939
CAME ABOUT THE SAME COULD BE

MILLIONS OF FAMILIES DEPEND UPON

02:33:41.912 --> 02:33:43.013
IT.

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:45.416
TODAY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION

02:33:45.482 --> 02:33:47.551
CALIFORNIANS COLLECTIVELY --

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:49.019
MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY

02:33:49.086 --> 02:33:50.654
BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:51.455
DEBT.

02:33:51.522 --> 02:33:52.723
MORE THAN HALF A MILLION OF

02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:54.959
THESE BORROWERS ARE AT LEAST TWO

02:33:55.025 --> 02:33:56.527
STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS BEHIND.

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:57.995
PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE

02:33:58.062 --> 02:33:58.629
HURTING.

02:33:58.696 --> 02:34:00.397
AND THEY NEED YOUR HELP.

02:34:00.464 --> 02:34:01.265
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:02.166
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN

02:34:02.232 --> 02:34:04.301
COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

02:34:04.368 --> 02:34:05.903
HAVE DOCUMENTED HOW THE STUDENT

02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:07.838
LOAN INDUSTRY HAS FAILED EVERY

02:34:07.905 --> 02:34:09.773
TYPE OF BORROWER WITH EVERY TYPE

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:10.741
OF LOAN.

02:34:10.808 --> 02:34:12.576
FROM HER FIRST BILL UNTIL HER

02:34:12.643 --> 02:34:13.911
LAST PAYMENT.

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:15.045
WE SEE STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS

02:34:15.112 --> 02:34:16.246
RIPOFF SERVICE MEMBERS AND

02:34:16.313 --> 02:34:18.382
VETERANS LIGHT A PUBLIC SERVICE

02:34:18.449 --> 02:34:21.118
WORKERS TRICK OLDER AMERICANS IN

02:34:21.185 --> 02:34:22.586
TWO YEARS OF UNEXPECTED DEBT.

02:34:22.653 --> 02:34:24.388
AND UNFORTUNATELY I COULD GO ON

02:34:24.455 --> 02:34:26.457
AND ON I CAME TO SACRAMENTO

02:34:26.523 --> 02:34:28.092
TODAY TO MAKE ONE SIMPLE POINT.

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.526
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT

02:34:29.593 --> 02:34:31.328
GOING TO RIDE TO THE RESCUE

02:34:31.395 --> 02:34:32.696
THERE IS NO CAVALRY ON THE

02:34:32.763 --> 02:34:33.597
HORIZON.

02:34:33.664 --> 02:34:35.299
I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW FAR

02:34:35.366 --> 02:34:37.601
BETSY DEVICE IN THE ENTIRE TRUMP

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:38.869
ADMINISTRATION WILL GO.

02:34:38.936 --> 02:34:40.604
UTILIZING THE FULL POWER OF THE

02:34:40.671 --> 02:34:42.072
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE

02:34:42.139 --> 02:34:43.574
DETRIMENT OF FORTY FOUR MILLION

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:45.576

02:34:45.643 --> 02:34:47.678
MILLION RIGHT HERE IN THIS STATE.

02:34:47.745 --> 02:34:49.613
BUT FORTUNATELY THESE BORROWERS

02:34:49.680 --> 02:34:50.881
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE

02:34:50.948 --> 02:34:52.182
POWER TO STAND UP FOR ITS

02:34:52.249 --> 02:34:54.652
CITIZENS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S

02:34:54.718 --> 02:34:56.620
LEGISLATION DOES EXACTLY THIS.

02:34:56.687 --> 02:34:57.454
SO I JUST LIKE TO CLOSE WITH

02:34:57.521 --> 02:34:58.222
THIS.

02:34:58.288 --> 02:34:59.723
YOU WILL HEAR FROM INDUSTRY THAT

02:34:59.790 --> 02:35:01.859
CALIFORNIA CANNOT ACT THAT BETSY

02:35:01.925 --> 02:35:03.594
DEVICE HAS IT UNDER CONTROL.

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:05.262
THAT THERE IS ALREADY A ROBUST

02:35:05.329 --> 02:35:07.031
SET OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BUT

02:35:07.097 --> 02:35:09.333
INDUSTRY IS WRONG DECEPTIVELY

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.068
AND DANGEROUSLY WRONG.

02:35:11.135 --> 02:35:12.369
YOU WILL HEAR THAT STATES LIKE

02:35:12.436 --> 02:35:14.138
CALIFORNIA SHOULD STEP ASIDE AND

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:15.139
LET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:35:15.205 --> 02:35:18.509
HANDLE QUOTE A FEDERAL ASSET.

02:35:18.575 --> 02:35:19.410
BUT CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN

02:35:19.476 --> 02:35:21.311

02:40:55.245 --> 02:40:56.313
THAT'S AN ASTONISHING QUESTION

02:40:56.380 --> 02:40:58.048
AND I THINK THE ONLY ANSWER I

02:40:58.115 --> 02:41:00.317
CAN GIVE YOU IS HERE IS A DIRECT

02:41:00.384 --> 02:41:01.018
QUOTE.

02:41:01.084 --> 02:41:02.686
FROM THE LARGEST STUDENT LOAN

02:41:02.753 --> 02:41:04.421
SERVICER IN THE COUNTRY THIS IS

02:41:04.488 --> 02:41:06.056
A DIRECT QUOTE.

02:41:06.123 --> 02:41:07.858
THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT THE

02:41:07.924 --> 02:41:09.159
SERVICER WILL ACT IN THE

02:41:09.226 --> 02:41:11.361
INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER.

02:41:11.428 --> 02:41:12.662
THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE.

02:41:12.729 --> 02:41:14.364
THE SERVICERS FEEL ABSOLUTELY NO

02:41:14.431 --> 02:41:16.066
OBLIGATION TO ACT IN THE

02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:17.934
INTEREST OF THE CONSUMER SO IF

02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.436
WE ARE PROVIDING TOOLS FOR THAT

02:41:19.503 --> 02:41:20.604
CONSUMER.

02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:22.372
THE TAKE ACTION FOR THEMSELVES

02:41:22.439 --> 02:41:23.240
WAR.

02:41:23.306 --> 02:41:25.842
UNDER THIS BILL ESPECIALLY TOOLS

02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:27.844
FOR LOCAL PROSECUTORS DA'S

02:41:27.911 --> 02:41:30.313
OTHERS TO TAKE ACTION ON BEHALF

02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:32.049
OF CONSUMERS THEN I THINK THAT'S

02:41:32.115 --> 02:41:35.852
A VERY GOOD THING.

02:41:35.919 --> 02:41:37.187
SO HOW DOES A JUDGE SAY BRIEFLY

02:41:37.254 --> 02:41:38.522
SO -- WHILE I WORKED AT THE

02:41:38.588 --> 02:41:40.123
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:42.426
BUREAU WE RECEIVED. SIXTY

02:41:42.492 --> 02:41:44.161
THOUSAND COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENT

02:41:44.227 --> 02:41:46.063
LOAN BORROWERS OVER THE COURSE

02:41:46.129 --> 02:41:48.565
OF LITTLE MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS.

02:41:48.632 --> 02:41:49.800
AND WHAT THOSE COMPLAINTS REALLY

02:41:49.866 --> 02:41:51.668
SHOWED WAS THAT THESE WERE

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:54.171
BORROWERS DESPERATELY TRYING TO

02:41:54.237 --> 02:41:56.239
PAY BACK THEIR BILLS THESE WERE

02:41:56.306 --> 02:41:58.108
BORROWERS WHO ARE REACHING OUT.

02:41:58.175 --> 02:42:00.610
FOR HELP -- AFTER THEIR LOAN GOT

02:42:00.677 --> 02:42:02.813
LOST IN THE SERVICING TRANSFER

02:42:02.879 --> 02:42:04.681
WHO KNEW THAT THE WORK IN PUBLIC

02:42:04.748 --> 02:42:07.350
SERVICE AND WE'RE ENTITLED -- TO

02:42:07.417 --> 02:42:08.518
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR LOAN

02:42:08.585 --> 02:42:12.089
FORGIVEN BECAUSE PROMISES MADE

02:42:12.155 --> 02:42:13.090
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:42:13.156 --> 02:42:14.224
THE EXAMPLE THAT I HAD NEARLY

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:16.193
UNANIMOUSLY WERE BORROWERS

02:42:16.259 --> 02:42:17.761
ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT

02:42:17.828 --> 02:42:19.863
THING ACTUALLY TRYING TO MAKE

02:42:19.930 --> 02:42:22.632
GOOD ON THEIR DEATH -- AND WHEN

02:42:22.699 --> 02:42:24.334
THEY REACHED OUT -- TO THEIR

02:42:24.401 --> 02:42:26.803
STUDENT LOAN COMPANY THEY GOT.

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:28.839
NO INFORMATION CONFLICTING

02:42:28.905 --> 02:42:30.740
INFORMATION OR DOWNRIGHT WRONG

02:42:30.807 --> 02:42:32.075
INFORMATION.

02:42:32.142 --> 02:42:33.610
AND I THINK WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:35.879
STONE'S BILL DOES IS ENSURE THAT

02:42:35.946 --> 02:42:37.147
THESE BORROWERS.

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:40.484
HAVE AN AVENUE FOR RECOURSE FOR

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:42.686
MISTAKES THAT COULD COST THEM

02:42:42.752 --> 02:42:44.888
LITERALLY HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:42:44.955 --> 02:42:47.124
DOLLARS -- NOT BECAUSE THEY DID

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:49.926
ANYTHING WRONG THEY TOOK ON THE

02:42:49.993 --> 02:42:51.862
DEBT WE ASK THEM TO THEY ENTERED

02:42:51.928 --> 02:42:55.132
FIELDS THAT WE ENCOURAGE THEM --

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:56.199
TO AND WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO

02:42:56.266 --> 02:42:58.568
SIMPLY GET THE RELIEF IN THE

02:42:58.635 --> 02:43:00.003
PROTECTIONS THAT THEY WERE

02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:01.338
PROMISED.

02:43:01.404 --> 02:43:03.373
A VERY LARGE OUT OF STATE

02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:05.308
COMPANY BECAUSE IT WAS IN THEIR

02:43:05.375 --> 02:43:07.811
FINANCIAL INTEREST TO DO SO.

02:43:07.878 --> 02:43:09.946
GAVE THEM BAD INFORMATION.

02:43:10.013 --> 02:43:11.448
AND I BELIEVE I THINK WHAT THIS

02:43:11.515 --> 02:43:13.550
BILL DOES IS CREATE A PATH BY

02:43:13.617 --> 02:43:16.019
WHICH PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THEIR

02:43:16.086 --> 02:43:18.955
FINANCIAL LIVES RUINED HAVE SOME

02:43:19.022 --> 02:43:21.191
RECOURSE TO TRY TO GET SOME

02:43:21.258 --> 02:43:22.659
JUSTICE.

02:43:22.726 --> 02:43:25.095
I'M MY QUESTION IS ARE.

02:43:25.162 --> 02:43:27.964
OBVIOUS -- ALONE SERVICE OF

02:43:28.031 --> 02:43:29.666
PROVIDERS.

02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:32.936
ARE LICENSED RIGHT.

02:43:33.003 --> 02:43:34.204
SO WHEN WE ARE GOING TO THE

02:43:34.271 --> 02:43:35.438
PROCESS RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE

02:43:35.505 --> 02:43:36.673
OF CALIFORNIA OF TRYING TO GET

02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:39.142
THEM LICENSED SO THAT WE HAVE

02:43:39.209 --> 02:43:41.144
SOME STANDARDS TO BE ABLE TO TRY

02:43:41.211 --> 02:43:42.913
TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.

02:43:42.979 --> 02:43:43.980
EVEN IF WE CAN DO THAT

02:43:44.047 --> 02:43:44.281
[inaudible]

02:43:44.347 --> 02:43:45.982
THERE.

02:43:46.049 --> 02:43:47.717
NOT EXHIBITING THE KIND OF

02:43:47.784 --> 02:43:49.986
BEHAVIOR WITH RESPECT TO THE THE

02:43:50.053 --> 02:43:51.354
BORROWERS WHO YOU WOULD THINK

02:43:51.421 --> 02:43:52.889
WOULD BE THEIR CUSTOMERS. TO

02:43:52.956 --> 02:43:55.058
HELP THEM MANAGE TO GET OUT OF

02:43:55.125 --> 02:43:56.993
DEBT THE DECISIONS THAT THEY ARE

02:43:57.060 --> 02:43:58.228
FACILITATING WITH THEIR

02:43:58.295 --> 02:44:00.597
BORROWERS KEEP THE BAR WITH AND

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:02.365
THAT LONGER THAN THEY NEED TO BE.

02:44:02.432 --> 02:44:03.767
PUT THEM INTO FORBEARANCE

02:44:03.833 --> 02:44:06.236
INSTEAD OF SOLUTIONS FOR GETTING

02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:08.205
OUT OF THAT THAT JUST KEEP THE

02:44:08.271 --> 02:44:10.207
INTEREST TAKING UP AND UP AND UP

02:44:10.273 --> 02:44:10.874
AND UP.

02:44:10.941 --> 02:44:12.375
SO THERE ARE OPERATING IN THEIR

02:44:12.442 --> 02:44:14.211
OWN BEST INTEREST NOT IN THE

02:44:14.277 --> 02:44:15.412
INTEREST OF THE BORROWERS.

02:44:15.478 --> 02:44:17.214
SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUT TO FLESH

02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:18.748
OUT THE LICENSING SYSTEM AND SO

02:44:18.815 --> 02:44:21.384
FAR MANY OF THESE.

02:44:21.451 --> 02:44:22.786
STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS ARE NOT

02:44:22.852 --> 02:44:25.255
COOPERATING WITH THE STATE

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.723
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT.

02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:28.858
AS THE LAW THAT WAS PASSED IS

02:44:28.925 --> 02:44:31.027
REQUIRES THEM TO DO.

02:44:31.094 --> 02:44:32.162
AND THEY'RE SORT OF THEIR

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:33.763
ESSENTIALLY THUMBING THEIR NOSE

02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:35.398
SO YES WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE THE

02:44:35.465 --> 02:44:39.336
BORROW SOME CELLS AND D. A.'S.

02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:41.338
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND OTHERS THE

02:44:41.404 --> 02:44:44.341
ABILITY TO TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE

02:44:44.407 --> 02:44:47.310
MALFEASANCE THE INCOMPETENCE THE

02:44:47.377 --> 02:44:48.912
INCORRECT TREATMENT OF THE

02:44:48.979 --> 02:44:50.513
STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS.

02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:51.781
AND GIVE THEM AND THE BAR WAS

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:54.150
THEMSELVES THE TOOLS TO REDRESS

02:44:54.217 --> 02:44:58.021
SOME PRETTY EGREGIOUS WRONGS.

02:44:58.088 --> 02:44:59.756
OKAY WHY UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:44:59.823 --> 02:45:01.891
RIGHT NOW WITH THE SERVICE

02:45:01.958 --> 02:45:06.529
PROVIDERS ARE NOT -- OPERATING.

02:45:06.596 --> 02:45:07.998
OUT WITH THE CALIFORNIA AS A

02:45:08.064 --> 02:45:10.066
REQUIREMENT TO BE LICENSED A WE

02:45:10.133 --> 02:45:11.568
DON'T HAVE A LICENSE FOR THEM TO

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:12.535
OPERATE.

02:45:12.602 --> 02:45:14.337
THAT IS BEING THAT IS CURRENTLY

02:45:14.404 --> 02:45:14.804
BEING ATTEMPTED TO BE

02:45:14.871 --> 02:45:16.640
IMPLEMENTED INCLUDING COLLECTING

02:45:16.706 --> 02:45:18.375
DATA FROM HIS SERVICERS BUT NOT

02:45:18.441 --> 02:45:18.942
ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW WE'RE

02:45:19.009 --> 02:45:20.143
COOPERATING SHOULDN'T BE THE

02:45:20.210 --> 02:45:22.946
FIRST STEP US SO THAT WE CAN --

02:45:23.013 --> 02:45:26.716
A DE REGULATE THE IF THE VIOLATE --

02:45:26.783 --> 02:45:30.987
WE JUST OF VIOLATIONS SO THEN

02:45:31.054 --> 02:45:32.022
THEY CAN BE DE LICENSED.

02:45:32.088 --> 02:45:33.857
NO WE ARE TRYING TO PUT SOME

02:45:33.923 --> 02:45:35.792
POWER TRYING TO LICENSE THEM

02:45:35.859 --> 02:45:37.027
WHICH IS APPROPRIATE AND ONCE

02:45:37.093 --> 02:45:38.628
CALIFORNIA PUT THAT LICENSING

02:45:38.695 --> 02:45:39.829
PROGRAM A PLACE WITH AT LEAST

02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:41.197
THE DEVON DOESN'T STATES NOW

02:45:41.264 --> 02:45:42.165
THAT ARE FOLLOWING SUIT.

02:45:42.232 --> 02:45:43.967
AND ALL OF THOSE STATES AND MORE

02:45:44.034 --> 02:45:45.135
ARE WATCHING CALIFORNIA RIGHT

02:45:45.201 --> 02:45:47.604
NOW TO SEE ASKING US TO LEAD THE

02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:49.906
WAY ON RECREATING SOME CONSUMER

02:45:49.973 --> 02:45:51.941
PROTECTIONS MOST OF WHAT WE BASS

02:45:52.008 --> 02:45:52.442
FOR HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:45:52.509 --> 02:45:53.610
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

02:45:53.677 --> 02:45:56.146
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT ALL OF

02:45:56.212 --> 02:45:57.614
THOSE HAVE NOW GONE AWAY.

02:45:57.681 --> 02:45:58.248
THEY ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:45:58.315 --> 02:45:59.683
IS NOT PROVIDING ANY OF THESE

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:01.651
PROTECTIONS SO WE NEED TO STEP

02:46:01.718 --> 02:46:03.053
IT SO LICENSING.

02:46:03.119 --> 02:46:04.354
THAT'S WHAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT

02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:06.156
ABOUT THE THE SORT OF THE TWO

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:08.491
FACES OF PROTECTIONS FOR

02:46:08.558 --> 02:46:10.360
CONSUMERS AND ONE IS HAVING A

02:46:10.427 --> 02:46:11.661
LICENSING SCHEME.

02:46:11.728 --> 02:46:14.164
THAT FACES THE SERVICERS THE

02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:15.999
REGULATED INDUSTRY AND WORKS

02:46:16.066 --> 02:46:17.300
WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:46:17.367 --> 02:46:18.768
THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST JOB THE

02:46:18.835 --> 02:46:19.869
OTHER THAN WOULD BE CONSUMER

02:46:19.936 --> 02:46:21.338
FACING THAT'S THIS PIECE.

02:46:21.404 --> 02:46:22.906
THAT LOOKS TO GIVE TOOLS TO

02:46:22.972 --> 02:46:25.508
CONSUMERS TO PROTECT THEM AND

02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:27.510
GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO REDRESS

02:46:27.577 --> 02:46:28.978
THE WRONGS THAT ARE HAPPENING SO

02:46:29.045 --> 02:46:30.914
WE HAVE A LICENSING STRUCTURE

02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:32.816
WHICH IS A REGULATORY STRUCTURE

02:46:32.882 --> 02:46:34.284
TO TRY AND HOLD THE SERVICES

02:46:34.351 --> 02:46:34.617
ACCOUNTABLE.

02:46:34.684 --> 02:46:37.087
AND THE THEN WE GIVE SPECIFIC

02:46:37.153 --> 02:46:38.088
RIGHTS.

02:46:38.154 --> 02:46:39.522
TO THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:40.924
THEMSELVES TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:42.892
THE GRIEVANCES THAT THEY HAVE

02:46:42.959 --> 02:46:45.729
WHEN THE LICENSEES IN THIS CASE

02:46:45.795 --> 02:46:47.364
OR THE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS TO

02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:49.399
THE EXTENT THAT THEY GET LICENSE

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:49.966
IN THAT PROGRAM CAN BECOME

02:46:50.033 --> 02:46:51.067
SUCCESSFUL.

02:46:51.134 --> 02:46:52.535
THAT THAT STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS

02:46:52.602 --> 02:46:54.604
THAT ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:46:54.671 --> 02:46:57.874
THE SENT TO THE THE WHAT WHAT

02:46:57.941 --> 02:46:59.376
THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:46:59.442 --> 02:47:02.746
UNDER OUR LAWS AND UNDER THE

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:04.681
SORT OF FADING FEDERAL STRUCTURE.

02:47:04.748 --> 02:47:06.816
THIS AMENDMENT STONE ARE YOU OF

02:47:06.883 --> 02:47:08.518
TEARING THAT BE A LICENSING THAT

02:47:08.585 --> 02:47:10.086
THAT IS ONE STATE THAT'S

02:47:10.153 --> 02:47:12.322
CURRENTLY THE LAW IN THE STATE

02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:13.256
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:47:13.323 --> 02:47:14.524
YES I I DID CARE THAT BILL

02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:16.726
COUPLE YEARS AGO.

02:47:16.793 --> 02:47:18.528
OKAY WAS THE STATUS.

02:47:18.595 --> 02:47:19.028
IT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED

02:47:19.095 --> 02:47:20.430
CURRENTLY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:47:20.497 --> 02:47:22.065
BUSINESS OVERSIGHT.

02:47:22.132 --> 02:47:25.468
IT HAS GONE INTO EFFECT YET.

02:47:25.535 --> 02:47:28.638
IT HAS GONE INTO EFFECT OKAY IF

02:47:28.705 --> 02:47:31.274
THAT'S THE CASE -- THEN -- WHEN

02:47:31.341 --> 02:47:32.776
THEY VIOLATE THE?

02:47:32.842 --> 02:47:35.578
LICENSING BODY WE HAVE -- THAT

02:47:35.645 --> 02:47:38.047
WAS MY FEARS OBVIOUSLY -- CAN

02:47:38.114 --> 02:47:39.349
NOT JUST TO TAKE AWAY THEIR

02:47:39.416 --> 02:47:41.651
LICENSE SAID.

02:47:41.718 --> 02:47:43.653
RATHER THAN TELLING.

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:47.056
ALL IT THIS IS OUR LIKE --

02:47:47.123 --> 02:47:49.092
ENCOURAGING PREVIOUS LAWSUITS --

02:47:49.159 --> 02:47:49.859
NOT FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BY ANY

02:47:49.926 --> 02:47:51.394
STRETCH OF IMAGINATION THIS IS

02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:53.630
HIM POWERING STUDENT LOAN

02:47:53.696 --> 02:47:55.598
BORROWERS WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGED.

02:47:55.665 --> 02:47:56.433
TO BE ABLE.

02:47:56.499 --> 02:47:58.268
TO TAKE GET REDRESS FOR HOW THEY

02:47:58.334 --> 02:48:00.003
HAVE BEEN WRONG.

02:48:00.069 --> 02:48:01.971
THE WITHOUT THE DISPUTE PEOPLE

02:48:02.038 --> 02:48:03.306
CAN ALSO WITH THEM NOW I THOUGHT

02:48:03.373 --> 02:48:05.575
THAT THEY CAN SUE FOR ANY REASON.

02:48:05.642 --> 02:48:09.045
IF THIS OBVIOUS MISTAKE

02:48:09.112 --> 02:48:10.713
COMMISSION SAID THEY WOULD SUE --

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:12.081
POTENTIALLY BUT THAT'S THAT'S A

02:48:12.148 --> 02:48:13.716
BIT NEBULOUS WHAT WE'RE DOING BY

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:15.518
THIS BILL IS CREATING THE

02:48:15.585 --> 02:48:16.986
FRAMEWORK OF RIGHTS AND

02:48:17.053 --> 02:48:19.222
RESPONSIBILITY AND CREATING A

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:20.757
STUDENT LOAN ADVOCATE IN THE

02:48:20.824 --> 02:48:22.091
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE

02:48:22.158 --> 02:48:23.326
THAT WE HAVE.

02:48:23.393 --> 02:48:26.429
A BROAD LOOK AT A A POINT. FOR

02:48:26.496 --> 02:48:28.198
STUDENT BORROWERS TO COME TO THE

02:48:28.264 --> 02:48:29.632
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ASK

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:30.433
QUESTIONS GET CORRECT

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:32.469
INFORMATION AND BE INFORMED OF

02:48:32.535 --> 02:48:34.237
WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE.

02:48:34.304 --> 02:48:35.071
THANK YOU SIR.

02:48:35.138 --> 02:48:36.239
THANK YOU MEMBERS ANY OTHER

02:48:36.306 --> 02:48:39.676
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:42.445
THANK YOU A AND RIVER SAM.

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:44.681
FOR BAUER-KAHAN YEAH I JUST WANT

02:48:44.747 --> 02:48:46.382
TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW.

02:48:46.449 --> 02:48:48.318
LIAM IT'S GOING TO SOUND OLD

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:48.885
WHEN I SAY THIS BUT IT IS

02:48:48.952 --> 02:48:50.954
ASTONISHING THE AMOUNT OF DEBT

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:51.554
STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WITH

02:48:51.621 --> 02:48:52.956
TODAY.

02:48:53.022 --> 02:48:53.890
IT'S SO MUCH MORE THAN WHEN I

02:48:53.957 --> 02:48:54.491
GRADUATED.

02:48:54.557 --> 02:48:57.126
AND THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS.

02:48:57.193 --> 02:48:58.394
IN A LOT OF CASES ARE MAKING

02:48:58.461 --> 02:48:59.362
MONEY OFF THE BACKS OF

02:48:59.429 --> 02:49:00.597
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

02:49:00.663 --> 02:49:02.332
AND THE LEAST WE CAN DO FOR

02:49:02.398 --> 02:49:03.867
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IS PROVIDE

02:49:03.933 --> 02:49:05.368
THEM WITH THE RIGHTS AND

02:49:05.435 --> 02:49:06.569
GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL BE

02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:07.937
TREATED FAIRLY AND THEY WILL BE

02:49:08.004 --> 02:49:09.339
ABLE TO PAY BACK THEIR LOANS

02:49:09.405 --> 02:49:10.306
WHEN THEY WANT TO AND SO I WANT

02:49:10.373 --> 02:49:12.609
TO THANK THE MEMBER STONE FOR

02:49:12.675 --> 02:49:15.945
BRINGING THIS BILL.

02:49:16.012 --> 02:49:16.579
I WANT TO MAKE A ASSEMBLYMEMBER

02:49:16.646 --> 02:49:19.349
STONE AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK --

02:49:19.415 --> 02:49:20.783
OFTENTIMES WE DON'T SPEND TIME

02:49:20.850 --> 02:49:22.919
OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THEIR

02:49:22.986 --> 02:49:23.820
RIGHTS.

02:49:23.887 --> 02:49:24.320
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE

02:49:24.387 --> 02:49:25.355
VULNERABLE AND THEY ARE

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:27.156
VULNERABLE TO ANYBODY WHO COMES

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:28.525
ALONG AND AND THEY FEEL LIKE

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:30.226
THIS IS WHAT THEY GET THIS IS

02:49:30.293 --> 02:49:31.127
WHAT THEY GET.

02:49:31.194 --> 02:49:32.495
AND OFTENTIMES IS A HIGH LEVEL

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:33.997
OF FRUSTRATION AMONG PEOPLE THAT

02:49:34.063 --> 02:49:36.199
THEY CAN ACTUALLY ADVOCATE FOR

02:49:36.266 --> 02:49:37.800
THEMSELVES GET SOME FAIRNESS AND

02:49:37.867 --> 02:49:38.801
SOME JUSTICE IN THIS WHOLE

02:49:38.868 --> 02:49:40.003
PROCESS AND SO.

02:49:40.069 --> 02:49:41.237
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:49:41.304 --> 02:49:43.039
STUDENT LOAN DEBT HAS BECOME BIG

02:49:43.106 --> 02:49:44.207
BUSINESS WE KNOW THERE.

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:45.909
ARE MUCH MORE THAN WHEN I WENT

02:49:45.975 --> 02:49:46.843
TO SCHOOL AS I SAID I GOT

02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:48.678
EVERYTHING FOR TWELVE HUNDRED

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:49.479
FIFTY DOLLARS YOU KNOW I

02:49:49.546 --> 02:49:50.079
ACTUALLY WROTE HIM A CHECK AND

02:49:50.146 --> 02:49:53.750
THANK THEM -- BUT YOU KNOW NEXT.

02:49:53.816 --> 02:49:54.784
OF WITH THREE DEGREES YOU CAN'T

02:49:54.851 --> 02:49:56.185
DO ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT

02:49:56.252 --> 02:49:57.620
FROM UNIVERSAL CALIFORNIA.

02:49:57.687 --> 02:49:59.122
BUT THAT WAS IN AN ERA WHEN

02:49:59.188 --> 02:50:00.823
PEOPLE BELIEVED IN AND STUDENTS

02:50:00.890 --> 02:50:02.825
AND BELIEVE THAT -- WE SHOULD

02:50:02.892 --> 02:50:04.027
ONLY.

02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:05.428
HAVE AS MUCH DEBT OR OF GRANTS

02:50:05.495 --> 02:50:07.330
AND LOANS THAT WAS REQUIRED AND

02:50:07.397 --> 02:50:07.997
AND WHEN OUR FEES WERE

02:50:08.064 --> 02:50:09.766
REASONABLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE

02:50:09.832 --> 02:50:10.867
THAT EDUCATING KIDS IN

02:50:10.934 --> 02:50:12.235
CALIFORNIA WAS RESPONSIBILITY OF

02:50:12.302 --> 02:50:13.503
CALIFORNIA.

02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:15.572
AND WE BENEFIT FROM THOSE FOLKS

02:50:15.638 --> 02:50:16.639
WHO WENT TO SCHOOL AND GOT THESE

02:50:16.706 --> 02:50:18.141
DEGREES MY FEET AND MY CONCERN

02:50:18.207 --> 02:50:19.242
IS THAT AS I LISTEN TO YOUNG

02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:20.910
PEOPLE OR THAT WHEN I WAS AT THE

02:50:20.977 --> 02:50:21.844
UNIVERSITY OF JUST.

02:50:21.911 --> 02:50:22.912
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STREETS

02:50:22.979 --> 02:50:24.213
THEY'RE BEGINNING TO CALCULATE

02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:25.548
AND DECIDE TO GOING TO COLLEGE

02:50:25.615 --> 02:50:27.283
IS NOT WORTH IT BECAUSE IF THEY

02:50:27.350 --> 02:50:27.850
END UP WITH THE DEBT THAT'S

02:50:27.917 --> 02:50:28.718
ENORMOUS.

02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:29.886
THEN THEY CAN'T PAY IT OFF AND

02:50:29.953 --> 02:50:32.121
SO IT BECOMES A DOWNWARD SPIRAL

02:50:32.188 --> 02:50:33.089
AND THEY LOOK THEIR COLLEAGUES

02:50:33.156 --> 02:50:34.357
WHO GOING TO COLLEGE WITH THIS

02:50:34.424 --> 02:50:36.225
DEBT NOW THEY SAY OH LOOK HE'S

02:50:36.292 --> 02:50:37.460
PAYING ALL THIS DEBT I'M WORKING

02:50:37.527 --> 02:50:39.095
A JOB DOING WHATEVER I'M DOING.

02:50:39.162 --> 02:50:44.601
AND I'M DOING BETTER AND SO I

02:50:44.667 --> 02:50:47.103
THINK THE THE OPTICS OF OF

02:50:47.170 --> 02:50:47.770
HAVING OUR STUDENTS SO DEEPLY IN

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:48.371
DEBT AS A RESULT OF GETTING A

02:50:48.438 --> 02:50:48.738
COLLEGE DEGREE.

02:50:48.805 --> 02:50:49.339
IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA

02:50:49.405 --> 02:50:50.607
COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE.

02:50:50.673 --> 02:50:52.375
A AND THAT'S IN AND AND THIS IS

02:50:52.442 --> 02:50:54.277
FROM FROM LOOKING AT AT MY AGE

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:56.346
LOOKING AT WHAT COLLEGE DEGREES

02:50:56.412 --> 02:50:58.881
MEANT TO MY GENERATION AND AND

02:50:58.948 --> 02:51:00.350
MANY OF YOUR PARENTS GENERATION.

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:02.185
THAT WAS REALLY THE THE GOLDEN

02:51:02.251 --> 02:51:04.220
TICKET TO A TO A TO A BETTER

02:51:04.287 --> 02:51:05.688
LIFE THAN THOSE WHO DIDN'T GO.

02:51:05.755 --> 02:51:08.057
AND AND SO AS A RESULT BUT NOW I

02:51:08.124 --> 02:51:09.225
LISTEN TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND

02:51:09.292 --> 02:51:10.493
THEY'RE ACTUALLY CALCULATING

02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:11.861
BECAUSE THEY HAVE FRIENDS WHEN

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:13.262
DEBT FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND OR

02:51:13.329 --> 02:51:14.097
WHATEVER IT IS AND IT KEEPS

02:51:14.163 --> 02:51:15.498
ESCALATING IT ESCALATING.

02:51:15.565 --> 02:51:16.633
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A WAY

02:51:16.699 --> 02:51:18.401
OUT OF IT OTHER THAN TO GO INTO

02:51:18.468 --> 02:51:20.169
DEFAULT AND IN THAT ROLE IN JULY

02:51:20.236 --> 02:51:22.038
FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME.

02:51:22.105 --> 02:51:23.406
AND SO WE KIDS ARE SMART NOW

02:51:23.473 --> 02:51:24.407
BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT MAYBE

02:51:24.474 --> 02:51:26.275
DOESN'T DOESN'T FACTOR OUT WHICH

02:51:26.342 --> 02:51:27.877
IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE

02:51:27.944 --> 02:51:29.345
POOR KID YOU NEED SOMETHING TO

02:51:29.412 --> 02:51:30.413
GIVE YOU A LEG UP.

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:31.881
YOU KNOW YOU NEED THAT DEGREE TO

SOME PARAMETERS OF YOUR FUTURE

AND SO I'M CONCERNED AND I THINK

02:51:36.753 --> 02:51:37.920
THIS IS GREAT -- THAT WE'RE

02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:38.855
DOING WE'RE NOT TELLING PEOPLE

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:40.056
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE

02:51:40.123 --> 02:51:41.591
DEBT AND SO FORTH BUT WE THERE

02:51:41.658 --> 02:51:42.759
ARE SOME RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE.

02:51:42.825 --> 02:51:44.160
AND AND AND THEY SHOULD NEED TO

02:51:44.227 --> 02:51:45.928
BE MUCH MORE CONSCIOUS IN TERMS

02:51:45.995 --> 02:51:47.163
OF THOSE WHO GIVING LOANS AS TO

02:51:47.230 --> 02:51:48.598
WHO YOU'RE GIVING IT TO AND AND

02:51:49.899 --> 02:51:51.334
GIVING LOANS TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND

02:51:51.401 --> 02:51:52.635
AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

02:51:52.702 --> 02:51:53.536
BUT I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

02:51:53.603 --> 02:51:55.071
IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT JUST

02:51:55.138 --> 02:51:56.706
BECAUSE IT'S A FAIR ISSUE SO

02:51:56.773 --> 02:51:58.341
FORTH AND SO ON BUT I LOOK AT IT

02:51:58.408 --> 02:51:59.409

GO TO COLLEGE.

02:52:02.679 --> 02:52:03.846

THEY'RE BEGINNING TO TELL ME

02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:07.016

02:52:08.251 --> 02:52:09.218
FRIENDS WHO WENT TO COLLEGE HAVE

02:52:09.285 --> 02:52:10.787
THIS TREMENDOUS DEBT THAT THEY

02:52:10.853 --> 02:52:11.587
DON'T HAVE.

02:52:11.654 --> 02:52:13.623

02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:21.297

ALLOW OURSELVES TO CONTINUE DOWN

02:52:30.406 --> 02:52:31.107
THIS PATH.

THAT THAT SAYS THAT THE IT'S NOT

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:34.410
