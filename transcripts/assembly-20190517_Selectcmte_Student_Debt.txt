THESE REALLY ARE KITCHEN TABLE FINANCIAL ISSUES FRAN DECIDING WHETHER. TO BUY A HOME. WHICH CAREER TO PURSUE WHETHER TO START A FAMILY TO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT. STUDENT THAT IS CASTING A SHADOW OVER SO MANY ASPECTS OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THE RIPPLE EFFECTS ARE BEING FELT ALL ACROSS. OUR SOCIETY. THIS SET IS FEELING ECONOMIC GENDER AND RACIAL AND INEQUITIES AND INHIBITING ASSET ACCUMULATION. AND ACCELERATING MATH GAPS THAT ARE ALREADY SO PERVASIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS REALLY IS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND ONE THAT I DON'T THINK POLICYMAKERS. HERE OR ACROSS THE NATION HAVE FOCUSED ON ENOUGH AND I THINK. PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHEN WE HAVE. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLEARLY MORE INTERESTED IN I TAKING CARE OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICE STUDENT AT THAN TAKING CARE OF THE CONSUMERS IN THE STUDENTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH IT. CALIFORNIANS ROLE AND I NEED TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. WHICH IS OF COURSE WHY WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY HI AND THIS COMMITTEE IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST IN THE NATION. TWO I TO LOOK AT THAT SO CALIFORNIA'S THE FIRST STATE TO HAVE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE DEDICATED TO THE TOPIC OF STUDENT AT TODAY'S HEARING WILL EXAMINE MANY ASPECTS OF THIS CRISIS WE'VE GOT FORCED PANELS. I SCHEDULE TODAY THE LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT LOAN DEBT THE DECISION TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS.

BEFORE WE WE CAN OFFER FIRST PANEL I'D LIKE TO WELCOME A COUPLE AS A FIX TO JOIN ME IN MAKING WELCOMING REMARKS. SOUGHT LOPEZ PLEADED THE SENATE PRESIDENT AS I HAD THE SEATED STUDENTS HERE AT UCI. THANK YOU AGAIN SOLVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE LEFT IT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE BEFORE WE KICK OFF [INAUDIBLE] HELLO. AND CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION CACHES THANK YOU MUCH FOR REACHING OUT -- HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T COME TO REGRET THIS -- I AM -- DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- MY NAME IS SALWA LOPEZ PLEA THOUGH WHEN I HAVE THE HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE OF PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. SO I THOUGHT -- MY JOB OR WHAT I'D SEE MY DUTY HERE IS TO INFORM NOT ONLY YOURSELF MADAM CHAIR BUT TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH VALUABLE INSIGHT AND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE AVERAGE STUDENT [INAUDIBLE] AND WELL AT LEAST MY INTERPRETATION OF THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE -- I LIKE MANY OTHER MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA I'M A DOCTOR RECIPIENT OF FOR ALL WHAT TIME ARE YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THAT'S DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS. CREATING -- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE DID. LAWS ME NOT TO GET DEPORTED AS FOR THE LARGE AMOUNT OF REASONS -- AND FOR MANY OTHERS OF MY STATUS -- I THOUGHT HIGHER EDUCATION OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IS OUT OF THE QUESTION -- I WAS RESIGNED -- THAT THE THOUGHT OF MY FUTURE POTENTIALLY WAS JUST TO WORK FOR MY FATHER INSTALLING NEON AND ACRYLIC SIGNS ALL OVER GREATER LOS ANGELES -- BUT I THINK LIKE EVERY LIKE JAPAN AND I THINK IN EVERY STORY OF A STUDENT. WHOSE FIRST GENERATION THERE'S SOMEONE AND MY OLDER SISTER WOULDN'T HAVE IT. AND THERE'S SOME WILL POWER SHE MANAGED TO DRAG ME TO ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE -- WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT I WANTED TO STUDY WITH NO CLUE HOW TO NAVIGATE THE FINANCIAL AID TO BRIARCLIFF CT ZERO KNOWLEDGE OF PROCESSING IT ABOUT. PRETTY MUCH ANY INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION. I SIGNED UP FOR CLASSES. AND JUST AS MANY OTHERS MY EXPERIENCE WITH THAT BECAME AFTER STARTING COLLEGE BUT MINE CAME. FROM A BIT OF BAD ADVICE. SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE FORTY WAS OR WHAT WE USED -- FOR IMAGINE MY SURPRISE HALFWAY THROUGH MY SECOND SEMESTER COMMUNITY COLLEGE ONE NOW I FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO COST TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A UNIT. BY THE GREAT JOB WHEN ASSEMBLY BILL TWO THOUSAND NOW MADE SIMPLER AB FIVE FORTY WAY EASIER TO NAVIGATE. SO WITH AROUND FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DEBT ON A CREDIT CARD. I TOOK A BREAK I STARTED WORKING AND RELIGIOUS -- AS A REAL ESTATE BROKER'S ASSISTANT I GOT COFFEE I SHOUTED AGENTS. AND FOR A TIME I WAS CONTENT WITH MY JOB AND WITH MY LITTLE PIECES THAT -- BUT LIKE A TRUE BELIEVER -- THE CALL OF THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME TO IGNORE. SO I BUCKLE DOWN RE ENROLLED IN COLLEGE I BECAME THE STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT MY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND I TRANSFER HERE UC IRVINE. AND I STAND HERE SENATE PRESIDENT. READY TO GRADUATE WITH ONLY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT -- GREAT RIGHT. ANOTHER MISSION WELL DONE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT HOW IT GOES ANYMORE. AND WHAT I OMITTED FROM THE RECORD ARE. SEVERAL BOUTS OF DEPRESSION. SUICIDE ATTEMPTS PARENTS SEPARATING. EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. CARD RATING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE FREEWAYS FROM COMMUTES THAT'S IN THE FAMILY. AND THE LIST GOES ON TODAY YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM EXPERTS PROFESSORS PROFESSIONAL POLICY RESEARCH CENTER. BUT WHAT WHAT FELL ON THE FLOOR WHAT WON'T FIT IN THERE FLOW CHARTS IN THEIR TEN POINT PLANS TO ELIMINATE STUDENT DEBT. IS THAT. VERY MUCH THAT SOME OF US IN STUDENTS COME TO REALIZE IS THAT LIFE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT. PLANS CHARTS [INAUDIBLE] OR PROMISES. THESE ARE REALITIES WE LOOK STUDENTS HAVE TO LIVE WITH. I WISH I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY STRUGGLES WITH IMPENDING DAN AND CERTAIN AND UNCERTAINTY OR UNIQUE. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT MY STORY SOME OUT LIAR SOME ANOMALY. BUT IT'S NOT. THE PEOPLE OF MY GENERATION ARE EXHAUSTED. FRUSTRATED [INAUDIBLE] THEY'RE SCARED. AND THEY'RE VERY BROKE. I KNOW SOMEONE THAT THE STORE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE DOUBLES EVERY FIVE YEARS AND I'M SURE NOW THAT STATISTIC IS PROBABLY WAY. WAY MORE. AND WHAT THAT ADVANCING COMES A JOB MARKET CROTHERS COMPETITION WHICH MEANS LITTLE LESS OPPORTUNITIES A LOT MORE WORK. AND A BLEAKER FUTURE. NOW I MEAN FOR THE RECORD I'M NOT SAYING THAT MY GENERATION IS AN UP FOR THE CHALLENGE -- CHOSEN MOUNTAIN WILL CLIMB IT. SHOWS THAT YOU BILL LIKE WHAT YOU THINK OUR CAPACITY IS AND I'M PRETTY SURE WILL COME FOUNDER EXPECTATIONS. WE KNOW WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HARD WE KNOW. THAT WE HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO EARN IT. AND WE KNOW THAT THE JOURNEY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE END RESULT. BUT IT COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER. JUST A LITTLE EASIER. AND IN THAT TINY DIFFERENCES WHAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. SO WHAT CAN YOU DO. I MEAN THE GOOD THE GOOD THING IS THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF OPTIONS. MY BEST ADVICE MATCH THE COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION TO THE STUDENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO TAKE A STEP TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. THE NEXT WORKERS TEACHERS ENGINEERS DOCTORS THEY WILL BE YOUR FUTURE OUR FUTURE. LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA CHAMPION AND LEADER OF EDUCATION SO THAT OTHER STATES CAN LOOK AT US AN EXAMPLE AND FOLLOW OUR SUCCESS. WORK WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE PASSED BILL SAYS SB FOURTEEN PROVIDING A LONG TERM BLUEPRINT FOR FUNDING FOR THE UC SB FOUR SIXTY ONE ALLOWING CAN GRAB CAL GRANTS TO EXTEND AND PAY FOR TWO SUMMER SESSIONS. SB THREE FIFTY FOUR ALLOWING TO QUALIFY. FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY FOR AB FIVE FORTY TO TAKE DREAM LOANS FOR GRADUATE SCHOOL SB FIVE SIXTY EIGHT A BILL WHICH TACKLES ONE OF THE MANY COSTS THAT AND STUDENT HOUSING. CREATE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WHO BECOME TEACHERS HOW BENEFITING THE BILL TO THE STUDENTS BY INCREASING THE COST OF TUITION. PRESSURE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS AND CHANCELLORS FUN CENTERS ARE PROVIDE ADVICE FOR UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. AND I KNOW A LOT OF THE TIMES. IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LEGISLATION AND JUST REQUIRES. SOME WILLINGNESS TO WORK. BUT ALSO AND JUST AS IMPORTANT. BE WILLING TO LISTEN TO STUDENTS LIKE ME WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THESE BILLS. LISTEN TO A PUBLIC COMMENTS AND TESTIMONY [INAUDIBLE] AND PLEASE [INAUDIBLE] DO SOMETHING. YOUR ACTIONS OR IN ACTIONS HAS REAL LIFE CONSEQUENCES. REMEMBER THAT PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO FINISH BY THINKING -- AND CHAIR -- CON PEACHY OURS FOR THE INVITATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AND ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH IN ORDER TO TACKLE THIS. I'M A DIFFICULT ISSUE. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST OF LUCK AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO KNOW THAT WE'RE COUNTING ON THANK YOU. SO I THINK -- YOUR AS YOU SPOKEN INSURANCE MY PURE STRAIN YOUR EXPERIENCE THANK YOU REALLY HIGHLIGHTED. THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE WE'RE FACING AND ALSO. IT THE FACT THAT WE'RE ONLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRESS AND WORKING TOGETHER. YOU SEE I I THINK ENJOYS MANY DISTINCTIONS BUT IN MY MIND I THINK. NINE IS MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THANK YOU SEE AYE AYES POSITION IS. NUMBER. ONE IN TERMS IS. AT NUMBER ONE UNIVERSITY FOR CREATING THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR MAKING THE AMERICAN DREAM A REALITY. WHICH IS REALLY PRETTY INCREDIBLE I'M WHICH LEADS ME TO OUR OUR NEXT SPEAKER I REBEKAH SANCHEZ IS THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS HERE AT AT YOU SEE I LOVE TO HEAR. FROM YOU BEFORE KICK OFF OUR FIRST PANEL. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND WE WELCOME YOU HERE TO YOU SEE I WERE GLAD THAT IT DIDN'T RAIN FOR YOU TODAY AND THAT WE HAVE SOME SUNSHINE TO SHARE -- THANK YOU SAW FOR YOUR STORY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ALL. AND TO HEAR YOUR WORDS AND AND BE OPEN TO LISTENING AND AND TO FIND SOLUTIONS TOGETHER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. FUNDING IN EDUCATION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND STRESSFUL THINGS -- THAT A STUDENT CAN DO AN ENCOUNTER AND WE WORK WITH MANY FAMILIES AND AND THAT FIRST YEAR THAT A STUDENT COMES HERE IS VERY OVERWHELMING AND I AND AND WE ARE HERE TO HELP DEFINITELY IN THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE AND THE UNIVERSITY. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT IS SUCH A PRIVILEGE TO WORK AT U. C. I. WE HAVE AMAZING STUDENTS HERE THIS IS MY FOURTH UNIVERSITY. I'VE WORKED IN THE FINANCIAL AND EIGHT INDUSTRY OVER TWENTY YEARS AND THE STUDENTS HERE ARE PHENOMENAL. AND THE LOAN DEFAULT RATES CAN INDICATE HOW WELL A UNIVERSITIES HELPING STUDENTS ATTEND COLLEGE WITHOUT RELYING TOO MUCH ON LOANS. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE UC I STUDENTS HERE THE DEFAULT RATE IS ONLY ONE POINT 7%. IN THE NATIONAL RATE IS TEN POINT EIGHT THIS IS AN INDICATOR HOW WELL OUR STUDENTS ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T OVER BORROW. AND THAT'S WHEN THEY GO INTO PAYMENT THERE'S SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T DO MORE OR SHOULD DO MORE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER. AND FINANCING AND EDUCATION DEFINITELY TAKES A VILLAGE IT TAKES THE STATE IT TAKES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKES THE UNIVERSITY AND IT TAKES A FAMILY. ALL OF US TOGETHER HAVE TO WORK TOWARDS A SOLUTION TO HELP LOWER INDEBTEDNESS FOR STUDENTS AND MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANTS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. FEDERAL STUDENT AID DOES CONTINUE TO SHRINK WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE SAW IT FIRST WHEN THEY GRADUATE STUDENTS LOST THEIR SUBSIDIES ON THEIR LOANS. WE SEE IT IN THE PROSPERITY ACTS THAT IS GOING FORWARD IN THE NATION THAT WILL REDUCE SCO JEEP GRAND TO WORK STUDY. WHICH WILL THEN REQUIRES STUDENTS TO NEED TO BORROW EVEN MORE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE AND OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND CONGRESS TO VOTE AGAINST THAT. WE CERTAINLY ARE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE STATE. USE ME WHO IS WORKING TOWARDS CAL GRANT TOWARDS SUMMER. OUR STUDENTS TYPICALLY FOR SUMMER TERM DO NOT HAVE ANY FEDERAL GRANTS OR INSTITUTION EIGHT REMAINING WHICH REQUIRES ALL STUDENTS TO BORROW MORE IN DURING SUMMER. HAVING CAL GRANT PAY FOR TUITION AND FEES FOR THE SUMMER STUDENTS REVISED IN. INSTANT ACCESS TO GRANTS AND NOT NEEDING TO BORROW THAN WHICH WILL HAVE. AN INSTANT AND OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUMMER THIS ALSO INCREASE GRADUATION RATES AND OFFER A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND OUR OFFICE PROVIDES OUTREACH TO HIGH SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE ON FINANCIAL AID. I AND TO HELP LOWER DEBT WE DO MANY WORKSHOPS TO TRY TO TELL STUDENTS HOW THEY CAN REDUCE THEIR INDEBTEDNESS. AND THOSE AND WE HOPE TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY CERTAINLY AND CERTAIN THINGS CAN BE COMMUTING AT HOME. LEAVING OUR CARD HOME KEEP THEIR PERSONAL EXPENSES TO ALLOW ALL THOSE CERTAIN THINGS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS ARE USING ALL THEIR TOOLS AND THEIR TOOL BOX TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEIR INDEBTEDNESS SEEMS LOW ARE STAYS LOW FOR THEM. AND CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT NINE THOUSAND AND IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT BUT FOR A STUDENT THAT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER MEANS. IT IS OVERWHELMING AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE HOPING TO IMPROVE I'M ALSO PROUD TO SAY THAT UCI. IS UNDERGOING A CAMPAIGN WILL BE AN IMPROVING MORE SCHOLARSHIPS ON CAMPUS WHICH WILL ALSO HELP. REDUCE BORROWING FOR OUR STUDENTS HERE AND I WOULD SAY NATION WIDE THE STRUGGLE IS THAT MANY STATES DO NOT HAVE A STATE GRANT SUCH AS CAL GRANT SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THE CITY CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE THAT. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NATIONAL STUDENT DEBT AND MANY STATES WITHIN THE NATION NEED TO PUT MORE SKIN IN THE GAME AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR STUDENTS FORCED? AND INCURRING HIGHER EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS. THANKS FOR BACK PAY AND I THINK YOU ALSO TEN OVER TEN I'VE FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP. WITH IN THIS IN IN SO MANY OTHER AREAS -- SO I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO NOW IS IS KICK OFF OUR FIRST PANEL AND REBEKAH YOU'RE PART OF THAT AS WELL. WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME MIKE PIERCE I TO JOIN US MIKE IS THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND MANAGING COUNSEL. FOR THE STUDENT BORROWER PROTECTION CENTER. AND DIED FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MIGHT BE FALLING ON OUR ON OUR AGENDA AT TWENTY ONE THAT'S RIGHT RANDI WEINGARTEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. IT'S GOING TO BE JOINING US A BIT LATER -- SEVERAL WILL KICK OFF OUR FIRST PANEL. AND MIKE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. FROM YOU AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND FOR THE CHANCE TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT COMMITTEE IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKE UP THIS ISSUE. IN SUCH A MEANINGFUL AND FOCUSED WAY -- MY NAME IS MIKE PIERCE -- AND IS AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED -- I AM THE MANAGER COUNSEL TO THE BARBER ACTION CENTER. SORRY. SUCH AS ME. SEVEN BETTER WORSE. SAME. SAME OKAY ALL RIGHT WE'RE GOING WITH THAT -- IN. THE SUMMER -- I WAS A SENIOR REGULATOR THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND WATCHING TO SEE WHERE WE WERE. TEN COMMERCE. WITH OVERSEEING. THE LARGEST FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES IN THE STATE LONG MARKET -- DURING MY TIME AT THE BUREAU WE WORKED ON I AM FORTUNATE ACTIONS AGAINST SOME OF THE LARGEST PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES IN THE COUNTRY INCLUDING -- COLLEGES OWNED BY CORINTHIAN -- AND THE I. T. TECH CHAIN -- WE ALSO WORKED ON A YEARS LONG INVESTIGATION THAT ULTIMATELY CULMINATED IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST NAVIENT -- THE NATION'S LARGEST AT ONE COMPANY -- ANY OVERSIGHT WORK WE THOUGHT IT WAS IT IS A KEY PART OF THAT -- FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS. AND I'M REALLY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TRY TO OFFER A BROADER FRAME AROUND THE THE REALLY BIG PIECE OF WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEES TAKING UP -- AND THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S TAKING UP. WASHINGTON HAS LOST ITS FOCUS AND IT'S REASSURING TO ALL OF US THAT THAT DID THE WORK IN DC. TO SEE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PICK UP THE MANTLE AND TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT OKAY FOR STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY. COMPANIES. AND SO I WAS ASKED TO JOIN TODAY TO OFFER A LITTLE BIT OF FRAMING ABOUT THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S GREAT TO SEE THIS FIRST HEARING. HE CALLED THE CHANGING FACE OF THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE -- TWENTY YEARS AGO. WE DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE TOOK OUT MODEST AMOUNTS OF DEBT. THEY WERE LARGELY ABLE TO MANAGE THAT DEBT AND SUCCESSFULLY REPAY IT THE CAL GRANT DID A LOT MORE THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE CAL GRANT HAS DECLINED OVER TIME THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE PELL GRANT HAS DECLINED OVER TIME. AND REPLACED WITH THIS BURDEN PUT ON INDIVIDUALS TO FINANCE THEIR EDUCATION THEMSELVES -- AND SO TO DATE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND BORROWERS IN RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE STUDENT DEBT. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND OLDER BORROWERS HAVE STUDENT DEBT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OLDER BORROWERS ARE ACTUALLY THE FASTEST SEGMENT THAT'S A GROWING SEGMENT OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS -- 300-100-0500 THOUSAND BORROWERS ACROSS STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOW BEHIND ON THEIR LOANS. WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK WITH THE CHANGING FACE OF THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS AT LEAST MEANS TO US IS THAT WE SHOULD CHALLENGE OUR OUR PRIOR WE SHOULD? THINK ABOUT THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT LED US TO A TRILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS WITH THE STUDENT AT NATIONWIDE -- AND ASK THE REALLY HARD QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHY AND AND WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE BARS THAT ARE BOTH YOUNG AND OLD -- THAT ARE URBAN AND RURAL THAT ARE BLACK AND WHITE THAT ARE THAT ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AND PEOPLE THAT GRADUATED IN THE UC SYSTEM -- IS A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN JUST A HANDFUL OF PREDATORY SCHOOLS FOR A HANDFUL OF PREDATORY LENDERS IT'S SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE -- WHICH IS I THINK PART OF THE REASON WE'RE SO EXCITED TO SEE THAT THE THE SELECT COMMITTEE WAS CREATED AND HEAR FROM THAT. THE LARGE COLLECTION EXPERTS AND INDIVIDUAL BORROWERS -- THAT ARE ASSEMBLED HERE TODAY AND WHY. SAULS OPENING REMARKS -- WE'RE REALLY SO MOVING AND AND HIT HOME IN SO MANY WAYS. WE THINK A LOT ABOUT THE BASIS TO DEBT CRISIS BEING. AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD GOING TO A STATE SCHOOL. WITH HELP FROM THEIR FAMILY. AND THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT STUDENT IT LOOKS LIKE IN CALIFORNIA OR IN AMERICA TODAY -- I THINK TODAY YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE SOCIETAL EFFECTS OF STUDENT AT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF STUDENT DEBT THE REALLY BIG POLICY QUESTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO CONFRONT. THE LEGISLATURE WHEN GRAPPLING WITH THIS THIS REALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE. SO -- I WANT TO CLOSE WITH A MORAL QUESTIONS THAT -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS TODAY? DO YOU THINK THIS IS RIGHT OR WRONG -- AND IT IF YOU LIKE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THIS IS WRONG. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT AND SO IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY GREAT TO START THIS DISCUSSION -- I'M I'M THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY OUTLOOK FOR TO BE ABLE TO SPORTS COMMITTEE IN ANY WAY WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU AND ONE THING I MEANT TO SAY BEFORE WE KICKED OFF OUR PANELS SO I'M. WE'VE GOT A COUPLE HASH TAGS I THAT WOULD LOVE FOR PEOPLE TO USE AS WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO THIS CONVERSATION. AND SIR HASHTAG STUDENT THAT HASH TAG PROTECT BORROWERS BUT TO EXPAND THE CONVERSATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION. FOR A SPECIFIC PANELISTS AS OUR CONVERSATIONS UNFOLD MUSES HASH TAGS AND WE WILL. FIND A WAY TO GET THEM TO ME AND I CAN POSE THEM TO OUR PANELISTS. I'M SO AGAIN ATTACHED TAKE STUDENT DEBT AND HASH TAG PROTECT. BORROWERS I'M REBEKAH YOUR DATE SHARED -- IN IT SIMPSON. GREAT INSIGHT AND PERSPECTIVE IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU -- THAT YOU WOULD ADD JUST AS WE KIND OF FRAME THE CONVERSATION AROUND AROUND THE LANDSCAPE OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT. DEBT I AM. I MEAN YEAH I'VE BEEN IN THE LIKE I SAID I'VE BEEN AROUND FINANCIALLY FOR MANY YEARS AND AND THERE DEFINITELY ARE SOME BAD ACTORS OUT THERE IS SUCH AS THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. I AND THAT DEFINITELY HAVE A PRETTY TERRY -- TYPE OF LENDING TACTICS THAT TIME. THEY TYPICALLY DON'T NEED STUDENT TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT SO THERE'S THERE'S DEFINITELY WORK TO BE DONE WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION. AND I I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION IS THIS WRONG OR IS THIS RIGHT AND I WOULD SAY A SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN FINANCIAL AID AND WORKS WITH INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AND AND SEES THE STRUGGLE THAT IT TAKES. TO AFFORD AN EDUCATION -- FOR MYSELF AND I DON'T SEE A STUDENT LOAN AS PRO NOR CON I BELIEVE FINANCIAL AID INCLUDING SELF HELP LOANS. AND ARE A TOOL AND I THINK AND IT'S ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT SOMETIMES STUDENTS NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO AFFORD AN EDUCATION. NOW SHOULD STUDENTS BORROWED ALL THAT THEY HAVE BEEN OFFERED YOU KNOW SHOULD THEY DO TO THE BORROWED THE ENTIRE AMOUNT. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BUT I THINK EVERY FAMILY NEEDS TO MAKE THAT DECISION WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE AFFORDABILITY FACTOR. FIRST DO THE NEED THE STUDENT LOAN SOME REALLY DO NEED THAT LAND AND SOWED RESTRICTING ACCESS TO THAT COULD BE -- YOU KNOW HAVE A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHERE WHERE WHERE PRICING OUT SOME OF OUR NEEDY STUDENTS THAT NEED ACCESS TO SOME HELP ELF -- SELF HELP AID SO -- I THINK WAY AND I AND I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IS THAT WE NEED TO BE EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS BETTER TO BE MORE DELIBERATE IN THEIR BARRING WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCIAL AID OFFERS. AND THEY SHOULDN'T JUST ACCEPT THE LANDS DOWN THE LINE OR ACCEPT ALL OF THEIR AID WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT WE DO SEE SENIORS THAT GRADUATE. AND THEY HAD TO GO TO THE LOAN EXIT INTERVIEW AND THEY DON'T REMEMBER BORROWING. AND IT'S NOT AN UNCOMMON STORY IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EDUCATION TO UNDERSTANDING. AND INDEBTEDNESS AND SELF FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT THEY'VE HAD TO GO INTO LOANS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE OFFERED CREDIT CARDS. I AM I THINK HIGH SCHOOLS COULD DO A LOT TOWARDS TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME OF THESE BASIC FINANCE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS A LOAN MEAN. AND WHAT DOES RESPONSIBLE BARRING MEAN AND AND WHY CAREER ARE YOU LOOKING AT AND WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU CAN BE FORTY THREE PAYMENT IN MAKING SURE YOU HAVE LIMITS. AND AND GOING FORWARD IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT -- WHEN GOING INTO A STUDENT -- LEARN TO TUITION. IT IS ALWAYS MY DESIRE THAT STUDENTS GRADUATE DEBT FREE AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE AND WE CAN DO MORE -- AS A COMMUNITY I AM BUT I THINK WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO THERE BUT I THINK THERE ARE ARE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE INSTANTLY LIKE THE CAL GRANT REFORM FOR SUMMER THAT'S GOING TO MAKE AN INTENT BY INSTANT IMPACT ON STUDENTS AFFORDABILITY. AND THAT TRYING TO PRIME PROVIDE MORE EDUCATION TO OUR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BEFORE THEY ENTER COLLEGE. AND SO AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THEY THE CONUNDRUM STUDENT AT I MEAN THERE THERE'S KIND OF THREE PIECES THERE'S JUST THAT THE COST THAT YOU KNOW THE PRICE TAG ASSOCIATED. WITH THE THE DEGREE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET. THERE IS THE AND IT AID PACKAGES AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO HELP PEOPLE PAY FOR THAT AND THEN THERE'S THE WAY THAT THE THE LOAN IS STRUCTURED AND AND THE RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOAN. I THINK YOU KNOW IT EVERY ASPECT THERE'S AN ELEMENT AS AND YOU KNOW I NEED FOR KIND OF ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL LITERACY AND TRANSPARENCY SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND FOR EVERY PIECE OF THAT EQUATION. AND I THINK BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON IS IS KIND OF THAT THIRD PIECE WHICH IS. THE LOAN AND REPAYMENT STRUCTURE IN JUST THE RIGHT. BECAUSE THE THE AVERAGE. RATE OF A STUDENT LOANS SEEMS. UNREASONABLY HIGH GIVEN. THE TYPE OF LOAN THAT IT IS AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOU KNOW. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WHETHER IT'S IN A THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT YET WHETHER THROUGH THE STATE GOVERNMENT OR THROUGH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SOME MECHANISM -- YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT THAT MORTGAGES ARE STRUCTURED SAID THAT WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER. LOWER TERMS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE CAN DO THERE I GUESS BOTH. AT A FEDERAL LEVEL WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THERE AND SECOND. WHAT CAN WE DO IT A STATE LEVEL IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR CURRENT FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION? I'M I DEFINITELY AGREE I THINK STUDENT LOANS ARE TOO HIGH AND I THINK WHEN I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THE SHRINKING OF A FEDERAL STUDENT AID AND HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THAT I THINK. YOU KNOW IS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS WAS SEVERAL YEARS BACK WHEN GRADUATE STUDENTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED PLANS AND SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE INTEREST BEARING. WHILE THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL NOW EVERY GRADUATE LOAN IS A IS AN INTEREST BEARING THAT'S AN UNSAFE LOAN -- WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE LOAN THAT WE ENCOURAGED. LEAST BECAUSE YOUR CURRENT INTEREST WHILE YOU'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL AS FAR AS A REPAYMENT PLANS I AM I THINK THE INTEREST RATE IS TOO HIGH AS WELL IT'S SET EVERY JULY FIRST IT'S GONE DOWN THIS NEXT YEAR SO IT'S BELOW 5% IT WAS IT'S 5% NOW AND HOW IT'S GONNA. GO DOWN INTO THE 4% SO I THINK IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- BUT I DO YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT HAD A SET INTEREST RATE ALONG LINES OF THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT DID WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN KEEP IT AT A LOW RATE. AND CERTAINLY AND BE BE USING THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE SAVINGS FROM THAT YOU KNOW THE GRADUATE. I AM SUBSIDIES INTO BACK INTO THE PROGRAM BUT THEY DID AND THEY ENDED UP USING IT FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE WHICH WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL. AND I THINK THE PROSPERITY ACT IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT TWO MEN CALLING AND THEIR FEDERAL. AND CONGRESS ABOUT IT CERTAINLY AND BECAUSE IT IT REDUCES THE AMOUNT -- AND GRANT FUNDING AND AND WORK CITY FINDING. AN I BELIEVE IN THE PROSPERITY ACT YOU KNOW THIS CALL THIS ONE GRANT ONE LONE BUT I'VE HEARD THEM TALKING ABOUT EVEN TAKING THE SUBSIDY AWAY FROM THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AS WELL -- WHICH MEANS THEY'LL BE OCCURRING THAT INTEREST WHILE THEY'RE ATTENDING SCHOOL SO WEIRD YOU KNOW THAT FEDERAL AID AND STOOD NAY DEMONSTRATORS SUCH AS MYSELF WE ADVOCATE VERY STRONGLY. TO PROTECT -- YOU KNOW THE OUR STUDENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING GOUGED CERTAINLY WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS AND I BELIEVE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND YOU KNOW SUCH AS THAT THE BILL THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT REALLY DOES LIMIT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEEDIEST FAMILIES TO COME IN. WITH A LOOK AT LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AND YOU KNOW I THINK I SAID INTEREST RATE WOULD BE BETTER BUT I THINK AND CERTAINLY THE SHRINKING OF OVERALL THE FEDERAL STUDENT AID IS VERY CONCERNING. CONSIDERING THAT THE NATION IS AN A STUDENT LOAN CRISIS IT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT STUDENTS WILL NEED TO BORROW. IF I COULD STOP FOR A A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE ON THE BACK END OF THE PROCESS SO. ALL OF THOSE REFORMS ARE ARE MEANINGFUL EFFORTS. TO BRING DOWN THE NET PRICE OF COLLEGE OF OUR HOURS AND CERTAINLY CAN DO ALL THAT WORK. THERE ARE FORTY FOUR MILLION AMERICANS THAT HAVE STUDENT LOANS WITH THE TERMS THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW -- AND THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION OF THEM LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THINGS LIKE -- BUT WITH THE CHAIR DOES MENTION THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE YOUR LOAN JUST LIKE YOU DO WITH A MORTGAGE TO BRING DOWN THE TOTAL COST OF YOUR DEBT. IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM CONFRONTING PEOPLE TO HAVE STUDENT AT TODAY. A RIGHT NOW THOSE PRODUCTS ARE LARGELY LIMITED TO THE MOST CREDIT WORTHY BORROWERS -- THERE REALLY ISN'T A ROBUST RE FINANCE MARKET THAT HELPS. A TYPICAL STE MIDDLE CLASS STUDENT LOAN. BRING DOWN THEIR INTEREST RATES THERE ARE FEDERAL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MAKE PAYMENTS AFFORDABLE -- INCOME DRIVEN REPAYMENT IS A NEAR UNIVERSAL RITE FOR EVERYONE HAS FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN. BUT IT'S NOT WORKING -- THERE WERE A MILLION DEFAULTS LAST YEAR AND MILLION DEFAULTS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT AND MILLION DEFAULTS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT AND A HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIA BORROWERS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR LIVES TODAY -- DESPITE THIS RIGHT TO MAKE A PAYMENT BASED ON YOUR INCOME. AND IF YOU'RE VERY LOW INCOME OR YOU JUST LOST YOUR JOB YOUR PAYMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ZERO DOLLARS A MONTH AND SO -- AS THIS COMMITTEE THINKS ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM I WOULD ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA ALSO THINK ABOUT BILLS LIKE. EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY SIX THAT FOCUSES ON DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM THE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS. AND MAKING SURE THAT STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT ISN'T LIKE A NECESSARY FEATURE OF THE STUDENT LOAN MARKET. FOR THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE. TO I I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT THE INCOME SINCE THE PLAN DOES NOT. WORK AS WELL AS IT SHOULD BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR A ZERO PAYMENT PER MONTH YOU ARE STILL ACCRUING INTEREST DURING THAT TIME OF THAT YOU'RE NOT IN YOU KNOW PAYING A MONTHLY PAYMENT AND SAID THAT INTERESTS IS COMPOUNDING. I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE INCOMES AND STEP PLAN WHEN YOU'RE YOU KNOW. HOW THAT DEFERMENT ON YOUR PAYMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY THAT THAT THEY WOULD ALSO PUT THAT ONE BACK IN FOR BORING AT FOR PARENTS WERE IS NOT OCCURRING ANY INTEREST FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE IT JUST? COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM REALLY IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO MAKE MAKE A MONTHLY PAYMENTS BUT YOUR OVERALL INDEBTEDNESS INCREASES BECAUSE THE INTERESTING CREWS ABSOLUTELY. AT YEAH AND I THINK. IT SOLD YOU IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS YOU MENTIONED. YOUR COLLEGE BEING PATTED THE AMERICAN DREAM RIGHT AND I THINK. FIRST OF MANY OF US EDUCATION HAS BEEN THAT AT IT WINDOW INTO. INTO A BETTER LIFE AND INTO A BETTER WORLD. RIGHT. WE'RE NOW IN A SITUATION WHERE I THINK. STUDENTS ARE FINDING THEMSELVES SO OVERWHELMED BY THE STUDENT AT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY NOW INHIBITING THEIR ABILITIES. TO ACHIEVE THAT AMERICAN DREAM TO BUY A HOUSE TO START A FAMILY. TO LIVE THAT BETTER LIFE AND THAT'S A THINK WHY THIS IS IT'S SUCH A PROFOUND. PROFOUND CHALLENGE RATE IN MORE THAN JUST -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE TAKING UP TOO MUCH THAT IT'S IT FEELS LIKE IT'S IT IS SIR SHORT CHANGING NOT. THAT DEAL THAT WE'VE ALL MADE ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM RIGHT WHERE IF YOU IF YOU WORK HARD PLAY BY THE RULES AND YOU GO TO COLLEGE YOU CAN HAVE THAT BETTER LIFE WE'VE GOTTA. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING GOOD ON THAT YOU HEAR IN CALIFORNIA IF. IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT ELSEWHERE I'M WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVES REALLY APPRECIATE IT OUT AT THIS POINT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS. I'M TRANSITION TO OUR NEXT PANEL AND SO ALL WHAT LET ME ABOUT THEM. OUR NEXT PANELIST AT OUR NEXT CONVERSATION IS. ARE THE SUBJECT IS THE DECISION TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS LET ME WALK AND MEGAN WAY MEYER. WHO IS THE CHIEF GOVERNMENTAL OFFICER? AT THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS AT CSU FULLER. TEN I DID NOW JONES A STUDENT TRUSTEE FROM LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. LARA'S DUBBO COMMITS THE ASSOCIATE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR. FOR THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. THANK YOU. TO ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES WITH US. MEGAN DO WHEN IT KICKS OFF. CAN YOU JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE TO NOTHING ON CONTENT MICRONS ARE HARD OKAY -- THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND SHARE STORIES ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- MY NAME IS MAKING ME MEYER AND I SHOULD MENTION I AM A THIRTY YEAR CAL STATE FULLERTON AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE CHIEF GOVERNMENTAL OFFICER. FIRST THE SEATED STUDENTS. I GREW UP SURROUNDED BY EXPECTATIONS I WOULD BE GOING TO COLLEGE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS HAD NEVER BEEN THEMSELVES NONE THE LESS THEY MOTIVATED AND ENCOURAGED ME THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS. IN HIGH SCHOOL I FOLLOW THE COOKIE CUTTER ROAD MAP TO COLLEGE I WAS A STRAIGHT A STUDENT WHO PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS. HAD AN INTERNSHIP AND VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE. I EVEN JOINED ALVIN ON MY CAMPUS WHICH IS A PROGRAM DEDICATED TO GIVING STUDENTS BOTH THE EMPOWERMENT AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO APPLY PREPARE FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION. I HAD DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT TO GET ACCEPTED INTO COLLEGE. BUT THIS DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF STICKER SHOCK. I STILL REMEMBER SEEN AT HOME WITH MY DAD. GREEN IN THE CHART OF COLLEGES THAT I HAD BEEN ACCEPTED. TO THIS CHART INCLUDED THE ESTIMATED COST OF ATTENDING THE UNIVERSITY AND MY ESTIMATED FINANCIAL AID. THERE IS NO WAY FOR OP ED OR ANY PROGRAM TO PREPARE AN AMBITIOUS STUDENT FOR THE HARSH REALITIES OF THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION. ULTIMATELY I CHOSE TO ATTEND CAL STATE FULLERTON FOR A PLETHORA OF REASONS BUT THE MAIN DECIDING FACTOR WAS ITS AFFORDABILITY COMPARED SISTER INSTITUTIONS. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I WAS FACED WITH THE DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS. EVEN SAYING THAT SOUNDS SILLY TO ME AS IF IT WAS EVER DECISION. FOR ME AND COUNTLESS OTHER STUDENTS LOANS WERE NEVER DECISION BUT RATHER REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN A HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS UP DESPITE RECEIVING A PELL GRANT A CAL GRANT WORKING TWO TO THREE JOBS I HAVE TO TAKE OUT STUDENT LOANS IN ORDER TO AFFORD NECESSITIES LIKE RENT BOOKS GROCERIES AND MORE. IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS ARE SUPPORT. THERE IS NO MANUAL OF WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR COLLEGE. THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR WHEN YOU'RE FINANCIALLY IT STILL DOESN'T COVER YOUR COST OF ATTENDANCE. I TOOK OUT THE ONES BECAUSE IT WAS NECESSARY. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW AND PROBABLY STILL NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT I SIGNED UP. FOR FINANCIALLY THIS COMPLEX. YES TYPES OF LOANS INTEREST RATES DEFERMENT PLANS AND SO ON I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY GUIDANCE AND WHAT'S THE BEST. LOANS ARE PAYMENT PLANS ARE. I JUST KNEW THAT I NEEDED THE MONEY. MANY STUDENTS IN THE CSU AS WELL AS THE UC AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS HAVE THEIR TUITION FULLY COVERED BY FINANCIALLY. THE STUDENTS ARE STILL STUCK WITH EXTRAORDINARY UNMET NEEDS. WITH THE FULL TRUE COST OF ATTENDANCE OFTEN EXCEEDED TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN THE CSU ARE LEFT TO COVER NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. OF A GAP THAT THEIR FINANCIALLY DOES NOT OFFSET. IT'S EASY TO PROCESS OFTEN CLAIM THAT STUDENT SHOULD SIMPLY GET A JOB OR PAY FOR THIS JOB. THIS BACK IN MY DAY BACK IN MY DAY MINDSET THAT STUDENTS CAN STILL WORK PART TIME TO AFFORD AN EDUCATION IS SOMETHING I'VE HEARD FREQUENTLY. HOWEVER SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE TUITION AND FEES IN THE CSU REST BY. A 1000310060%. DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD FOOD AND HOUSING RELATED EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED BY 40%. THE COST OF COLLEGE IS DRASTICALLY INCREASE OUR GENERATIONS. I AM ONE OF MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE WORKING TO AN OUTSIDE THREE JOBS IN ORDER TO A FOR THE COST OF A DEGREE. WE DO THIS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING FULL TIME STUDENTS. WERE ALSO INVOLVED BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS. I'M STILL A STUDENT TRYING TO TO DO ALL THE RIGHT THINGS. AS I MENTIONED I'M WORKING TWO JOBS I MEAN HOLDEN SIX CROSSES. I'M INVOLVED IN STUDENT GOVERNMENT WHERE I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE CHIEF GOVERNMENTAL OFFICER AND REPRESENT OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS ON A LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. HOWEVER THERE'S NOT ONE SINGULAR MODEL SUCCESS IN COLLEGE. ITS SUCCESS WORKING ENOUGH TO PAY MY RENT AND TUITION AND THEREFORE LOSING TIME TO STUDY OR SUCCESS CUT IN A COUPLE OF WORK HOURS TO STUDY. FOR MY EXAMS AND THEREFORE HAVING TO SKIP GROCERY SHOPPING FOR THE WEEK. DECISIONS AND SACRIFICES LIKE THESE ARE MY STUDENT LOAN STUFF LIKE A DECISION TO ME. ALTHOUGH STUDENT WANTS TO HELP ME PROCESS PURSUE MY DREAMS AND OBTAIN A HIGHER EDUCATION IT HAS COME WITH A COST. I CURRENTLY TAKE OUT BOTH FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED AND SUBSIDY UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS. ADDITIONALLY IN ORDER TO AFFORD THE HIGH COST OF LIVING ON CAMPUS MY FRESHMAN YEAR. I TOOK OUT A PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN. ALTOGETHER THIS ADDS UP TO A GRAND TOTAL OF 210-005-0020 ONE DOLLARS AND I'M ONLY IN MY THIRD YEAR OF COLLEGE. I WILL HAVE TO PAY THESE BACK. AFTER GRADUATION WITH INTEREST. THE PRIVATE ONE HOBBY NEARLY 11% INTEREST RATE. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE LOANS LAST BEYOND OUR TIME IN COLLEGE. I'LL BE TAKING YEARS POST GRADUATION TO PAY OFF MY EDUCATION. AND TO BE HONEST I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WHY MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THEM OFF? WHY BE ELIGIBLE FOR POTENTIAL LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS WHAT HAPPENS IF I CAN'T PAY THEM OFF? I CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THESE QUESTIONS FOR TOMORROW BECAUSE I'M BUSY WORRIED ABOUT HOW TO MAKE AND IT'S HOW TO MAKE ENDS MEET TODAY. THESE BURDENS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO THESE INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONS CLAIM THEY SERVE. I THINK A LOT ABOUT THREE ALMOST FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS TRYING TO DECIDE WHERE TO GO TO COLLEGE MY DECISION WAS ARE LARGELY SWAYED BY MONEY. DESPITE MY AMBITIONS AND ABILITIES. DESPITE THE FACT THAT I CHOSE THE MORE AFFORDABLE OPTION. I AM STILL STUCK IN STUDENT LOANS AND STRUGGLE TO BALANCE BEING A FULL TIME STUDENTS WHO STUDENT WHO WORKS SEVERAL JOBS. STUDENTS SHOULD I HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES AND TAKE ON MY PHONE BURDENS TO OBTAIN SOMETHING NOW MORE NECESSARY. THIS OPPORTUNITY AND ITS BENEFITS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WILLING TO LEARN AND WORK HARD. NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE PRIVILEGED ENOUGH TO HELP THE MEANS. TOGETHER WE NEED TO FIND THE ADDRESS THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS LIKE MANY TO COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIALLY REFORM. UNLESS YOU PROVIDE STUDENTS LIKE ME WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SIMPLY SURVIVE COLLEGE THAT. THIS CRISIS WILL ONLY WORSEN. THANK YOU AND YEAH I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORM AND THANK YOU. FOR YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND DAN. I THINK ONE THING. IT'S ALWAYS EASY FOR IT'S EASY FOR THE STORIES GET LOST WHEN WE SAY THINGS LIKE. WE'VE GOT THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION BORROWERS AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN DEBT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE DEFAULTING IT. SOUNDS SCARY AND MASSIVE BUT IT'S SO SO IMPORTANT I THINK FOR US. TO BE ABLE TO PUT A PERSONAL ON A HUMAN FACE ON IT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY GALVANIZES POLICYMAKERS. TO FOCUS ON ON ISSUES AND AND DEFINING SOLUTIONS [INAUDIBLE] SURE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU TODAY. COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS IS A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION BASED IN OAKLAND. I SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ASSOCIATE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND LEAD ITS COALITION OF CALIFORNIANS FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY EQUITY IN OUTCOMES NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT MORE STUDENTS CAN COMPLETE MEANING FOR POST SECONDARY CREDENTIALS WITHOUT BURDENSOME DEBT. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEES FOCUS ON HOW THE STATE CAN IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS TO ALLEVIATE HAVING STUDENT DEBT BURDENS THAT TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS KERRY. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT REQUIRE AND SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE STATE TO BETTER ENSURE THAT STUDENTS HAVE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT HAVING TO BORROW WORK EXCESSIVELY IN THE FIRST PLACE. DECADE TAKEN THINGS HAVE SHOWN THAT DESPITE THE LONG STANDING FOCUS ON LOW TUITION AND GENEROUS FINANCIAL PROGRAMS THAT COVER TUITION. REASONS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA. FOR TUITION INSURANCE STUDENTS CAN RUN COLLEGE. TO SUCCEED IF WE CANNOT AFFORD THE COST BEYOND IT. INCLUDING GAS TO GET TO CAMPUS TEXT BOOKS FOR COURSE WORK IN A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. FREQUENTLY BORROWING LOANS TO FILL THE GAP ON AFFORDABLE COLLEGE COSTS ARE KEY DRIVERS OF STUDENT DEBT. I WAS SHOWN THE CALIFORNIANS WITH INCOMES UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WALDRON PUBLIC COLLEGES HAVE TO SPEND ABOUT HALF OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME. TO COVER COLLEGE COSTS AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR GRANT AID. WHAT IS NOT EASILY AFFORDABLE FOR MANY STUDENTS THESE DAYS THE SHARES OF INCOME EXPECTED FROM THESE LOW INCOME STUDENTS IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE SHARE IS NEEDED FROM ANY OTHER INCOME GROUPS? ANALYSIS FOUNDED IN REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PUBLIC COLLEGE OPTION FOR STUDENTS FROM FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IN OTHER WORDS THE LOWEST MISSION COLLEGE IS NOT THE LOWEST COST COLLEGE FOR STUDENTS. THAT IS BECAUSE NINE TUITION COLLEGE COSTS MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF TOTAL COSTS THAT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S COLLEGE STUDENTS AND ROLL. WITH THE STATE EIGHT POLICIES DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO COVER TUITION LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENROLLED AT LOWER TUITION COLLEGES RECEIVE FAR LESS FINANCIALLY. TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT THE TOTAL COST OF COLLEGE OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THERE IS MORE THAN 3100% MORE GRANT AID AVAILABLE TO YOU SEE STUDENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PEERS. WHAT? THE TINO STUDENTS THREE AND FIVE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF BLACK STUDENTS COME FROM FAMILIES MAKING LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THESE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES ALSO RAISE SUBSTANTIAL EQUITY CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO BOTH STUDENT DEBT BURDENS AND COLLEGE COMPLETION. FOR OVER A DECADE WE HAVE TRACKED THE RATE AT WHICH COLLEGE GRADUATES LEAVE SCHOOL WITH DAD. IN CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY COMPARED FAVORABLY TO OTHER STATES. OVERALL AMONG PUBLIC AND NONPROFIT FOUR YEAR COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HAS THE FIFTH LOWEST AVERAGE DEBT GRADUATION AT ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THERE ARE NO DATA AVAILABLE FOR BACHELORS DEGREE GRADUATES FROM CALIFORNIA FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AS THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE NECESSARY DATA. HOWEVER NATIONAL DATA SHOW THAT FOR PROFIT COLLEGE GRADUATES ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO LEAVE SCHOOL ATTACK AND HAVE 41% MORE ON AVERAGE. ALSO OF NOTE MORE THAN HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA LOAN DEFAULTERS ATTENDED FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. DESPITE CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY GOOD STANDING COMPARED TO OTHER STATES ARE ANALYSES HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT THE BURDEN OF DEBT IS NOT BORING EVENLY AMONG CALIFORNIA GRADUATES. WHEN WE DIG DEEPER WE FIND THAT UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE TAKEN ON THAT? ALL RIGHT NOW WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENT ASSOCIATION FOUND THAT WHILE ABOUT HALF OF ALL UC GRADUATES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN HAD A CURRENT STUDENT AT TWO THIRDS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO GRADUATES HAD DEBT COMPARED 240% OF WHITE GRADUATES. MOREOVER THE LOWEST INCOME GRADUATES ARE MORE THAN THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BORROW AT THEIR HIGHEST IN COMPUTERS. ALL RIGHT NOW SEASON OF CSU GRADUATES REPEAL SIMILAR TRENDS WITH STUDENTS OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BORROW IN TWO THIRDS OF GRADUATES WITH DEBT COMING FROM FAMILIES THAT MAKE LESS THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WHAT THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING IS ON STUDENT DEBT IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT SOME STUDENTS CHOOSE TO BORROW IN THE FACE CHOOSE NOT TO BORROW IN THE FACE OF ON AFFORDABLE COLLEGE COSTS? FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO BORROW EXCESSIVE WORK HOURS MAY BE NECESSARY TO COVER TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS. ARE AFTER MENTION ANALYSIS ON LOW INCOME STUDENTS NET COSTS FOUND THAT AFTER AVAILABLE GRANT AID ALL WE HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY HOURS PER WEEK TO COVER TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS. AND AT SEVERAL COLLEGES THE NUMBER OF WEEKLY WORK HOURS NEEDED EXCEEDED. THIRTY WE SEE THIS HARMFUL TRENDS BECAUSE TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING LEFT OUT OF STATE FINANCIAL AID AND THOSE WHO DO RECEIVE GRANTS OFTEN GET TOO LITTLE OF IT. WELL THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WELL DESIGNED TO REACH COLLEGE BOUND HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS WHO ARE RETURNING TO SCHOOL MORE THAN ONE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. DO NOT RECEIVE GRANTS AND MOST OF THEM HAVE INCOMES SO WELL WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY TO THEIR EDUCATION. AND FOR THOSE WHO DO RECEIVE A GRANT. THE VALUE OF THE ACCESS AWARD THAT HELP STUDENTS PAY FOR NON TUITION COSTS IS WORTH LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF ITS ORIGINAL VALUE. THAT IS WHY WE GET MORE THAN TWO DOZEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR INCREASES TO THE NUMBER OF CAL GRANTS AVAILABLE IN FOR THE AMOUNT OF AID THAT STUDENTS GOT TO COVER NON TUITION COSTS. TO BEAR SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THE COST THEIR INCURRING AND THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THEM. AT THIS POINT THERE IS A STRONG CONSENSUS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS REFLECTED IN LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS. TO REFORM STATE FINANCIALLY IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WHILE MANY DETAILS ARE STILL BEING WORKED THROUGH COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY ADVOCATES AGREE THAT THE STATE SHOULD TAKE ON TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS. AND EXPECTED STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WOULD MAKE FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE REASONABLE. THE REST WOULD BE COVERED BY FEDERAL COLLEGE IN AND STATE GRANT EIGHT AB THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND MCCARTY WOULD REFORM THE STATE CAL GRANT PROGRAM TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS AND BETTER COVER TOTAL COLLEGE COST OF ATTENDANCE. PROVIDING A DEBT FREE CAN'T PATH TO A DEGREE. FINALLY EVEN MORE IMMEDIATELY CURRENT BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE STRIDES ON THE AVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY OF NEED BASED FINANCIAL AID. THE GOVERNOR AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IS IN BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY HAVE ALL SIGNALED SUPPORT FOR INCREASED FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS AS A DOWN PAYMENT TOWARDS LARGER REFORM EFFORTS TO BE PHASED IN IN THE COMING YEARS. SUCH IMMEDIATE INVESTMENTS PROPERLY TARGETED WOULD MAKE AN IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE IN THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO GET TO AND THROUGH COLLEGE WITHOUT BURDENSOME LEVELS OF STUDENT AT HE GETS IN OUR COALITION RECOMMEND THAT NEW INVESTMENTS BE SPENT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AND TO INCREASE THE SIZE. OF THE GRANT THAT HELPS LOW INCOME STUDENTS COVER NOT TUITION COSTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND FOR ALL YOU ARE DOING TO STRENGTHEN COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND REDUCE STUDENT DEBT BURDENS. THANK YOU AND YOU YOU SAID YOU HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON I IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW I'M. THIS GOVERNOR HAS ANNOUNCED. THAT HE IS. EXTRAORDINARILY COMMITTED TO EDUCATION ACCESS FROM FROM CRADLE TO CAREER AND I'M WE ARE LOOKING AT HIS STARK INVESTMENTS NOT JUST IN THE CAPE THREE COLORING A BUT IN. HIGHER EDUCATION -- BECAUSE AS YOU SAID. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT. IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN IN THE NEXT GENERATION AND AND FRANKLY IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN. THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OF CALIFORNIA AND I DO THINK THAT THAT IS THE ORIENTATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AS WERE GRAPPLING WITH. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE INVESTMENTS NOW AND HOW DO WE FACE AND MORE MORE COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS? SO THANK YOU I'M. TO KNOW JEN'S. THE MORNING OF LEVEL OF HELLO HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. ALL RIGHT. AWESOME -- WHICH WOULD LEAVE OFFICE. IF ANYONE [INAUDIBLE] FORBEARANCE THANK. YOU GUYS ARE GREAT -- THE TWO MET QUALIFIED FOR FOR MARRIAGE WHICH MEANT THAT I WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS. FOR THE TIME BEING AND THAT THEY COULD START THE PROCESS IMMEDIATELY. TO KEEP MY LOAN FROM GOING INTO DEFAULT. I WAS NOT INFORMED OF ANY OTHER OPTIONS. THE ONLY THING I TOOK MY CONVERSATION. WAS THAT. I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS. SO I TOLD THEM SIGN ME UP FOR THE BARE HANDS. THEY PROCEEDED TO RATTLE OFF A BUNCH OF FINE PRINT JARGON -- BREAKNECK SPEEDS NONE OF WHICH I UNDERSTOOD AND BOOM LIKE MAGIC I WAS NO LONGER IN THE FOR PAYMENTS I COULDN'T AFFORD. OR SO I THOUGHT. ULTIMATELY MY LOANS WHEN IS DEFAULT. FAST FOR NINE YEARS TO PRESENT DAY. I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ROLE COLLEGE FULL TIME. I'VE COMPLETED MY FIRST TWO YEARS AND IT APPEARING TO TRANSFER THE UNIVERSITY THIS FALL. I DIDN'T BOTHER TO APPLY FOR FAST WHEN I ROLLED ALONG WITH CITY COLLEGE. BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULD QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID DUE TO MY DEFAULTED STUDENT LOANS THAT IS. AS SUCH I PAID OUT OF POCKET FOR BOTH MY OWN MY OWN AND MY WIFE'S TUITION. IT WAS MANAGEABLE IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I WAS WORKING TWO PART TIME JOBS. PLUS MOONLIGHTING AS A NEW DRIVER LIFT DRIVER INDOOR TEST DRIVER -- LAST YEAR HOWEVER I LOST BOTH MY JOBS. IN MY ABILITY TO FOR COLLEGE TUITION FOR TO VIRTUALLY VANISHED. JUST THREE WEEKS AGO. I ACCOMPANIED MY WIFE. TO THE CASHIER'S OFFICE WITH THE MONEY THAT WAS INTENDED FOR RENT. TO MAKE A PARTIAL PAYMENT ON HER ACCOUNT. SO THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE DROPPED FROM REQUEST FOR NON PAYMENT -- AND WE BEG THE CASHIER TO IS TO ASSURE US THAT IF WE MADE THIS PAYMENT. THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN OUR CLASSES EVEN IF IT COST US. A ROOF OVER OUR HEAD. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER -- TO QUALIFY FOR THE A. B. -- NINETEEN WEAVER I WAS TOLD IF I JUST FULL OF THE FAST WHEN FORTUNATELY WE WERE GRANTED THAT IN THAT. GIVE US A MUCH NEEDED RELIEF. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR A RESULT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I CAN DO. TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID AGAIN. BECAUSE THE BURDEN WAS JUST TOO TOO MUCH. I WAS DIRECTED TO A COLLECTION AGENCY. WHO TOLD ME ABOUT THE LOAN REHABILITATION PROGRAM? I TOLD ABOUT MY CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SET ME UP WITH PAYMENTS THAT EVEN I COULD AFFORD. AND I AM ACTIVELY WORKING TO GET OUT OF DEFAULT. HOPEFULLY IF EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN TOLD IS TRUE BUT SHOULD BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID AGAIN. BY THIS TIME NEXT MONTH. WHAT THE MORAL OF THE STORY? IS THAT ACQUIRING AN EDUCATION. SHOULD NOT BE THIS DIFFICULT. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ROAD IS IS IS LONG AND HARD. AND AND SALAS SAID YOU KNOW WE ARE UP TO THE CHALLENGE. HOWEVER I JUST TURNED THIRTY IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR AND ECONOMICALLY I AM BEHIND MANY OF MY PEERS. SIMPLY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS OR KNOWLEDGE TO NAVIGATE THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. EVEN NOW MY ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD ON A JOURNEY AS SET UP ON OVER NINE YEARS AGO. IS IN JEOPARDY. AS A RESULT OF THIS DEFICIENCY. I KNOW THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS STORY WITH A SIMILAR STORY. BECAUSE I JUST CAME BACK FROM THE STUDENT SENATE OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST. WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS [INAUDIBLE] EXHAUSTIVELY. WE WERE ECSTATIC TO LEARN ABOUT THE LEGISLATION THAT SENATOR CONNIE LEIVA. AND SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES CHAMPION TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY. WOULD SENATE BILL. TWO NINETY ONE WE CELEBRATED ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS HOLDEN IN THIS COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ACCESS. AND TRANSPORTATION FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND WE APPLAUD YOU TODAY. CHEER YOU NORTH. FOR BEING COGNIZANT OF IN RESPONDING. TO THE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS THAT PLAGUES OUR STUDENTS TODAY. HELP US SUCCEED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. I THINK ACTUALLY HE SAID THE MORE OF YOUR STORY WAS THAT GETTING AN EDUCATION JUST SHOULD NOT BE THIS HARD THERE'S IN THEIR SEVERAL MORALS OF YOUR STORY BECAUSE THEY THINK. THAT. YOUR EXPERIENCES HIGHLIGHTS. I THINK SO MANY ELEMENTS THAT ARE BROKEN. AND I THINK. THERE THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE BROKE AND AND YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT IN A GOOD ENOUGH JOB EXPLAINING OPTIONS TO PEOPLE ARE LEADING THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND THEN I THINK WHAT WOULD IS VERY UPSETTING IS AND THERE'S ALSO THESE BAD ACTORS WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY. PROFITEERING FROM THE AT LACK OF INFORMATION THE LACK OF GOOD INFORMATION THAT'S OUT THERE AND SOME OF THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. IN YOU HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF YOU AND TAKING ADVANTAGE AS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WE HAVE A PACKAGE OF BILLS -- MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE SEVEN BILLS THAT ARE. I'M LOOKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BIG ISSUES AROUND FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AND AND ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT. BETTER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AS PART OF THAT SO. YEAH AS IN EVERYTHING NOT ALL FOR PROFIT COLLEGES -- ABOUT ACTORS BUT THERE ARE SOME. THAT ARE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THEY'RE NOT MAKING AN ALREADY REALLY TOUGH SITUATE SITUATION EVEN WORSE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I'M IN A FIRST FOR YOU. TOO SO AT AND I THINK A I KNOW THE ANSWER. TO DID YOU RECEIVE A FINANCIAL AWARD LETTER. WHEN YOU WERE CONSIDERING OUR OPTIONS DID YOU RECEIVE ANY SORT OF LETTER? THAT YOU'RE ABLE. TO LOOK AT A RADIO. FOR ME IT WAS ON OUR LIKE STUDENT PORTAL YOU COULD GO IN THERE TO SEE YOUR FINANCIAL AID OFFERS -- AND THEN IT WAS REALLY LIKE. THERE IT THE GRANTS THAT I WAS OFFERED AND THEN THE STUDENT LOANS AND LIKE ACCEPTING THE SENATE WANTS IS REALLY JUST AS EASY AS LIKE PRESSING THE BUTTON THAT SAID EXCEPT -- AND SO I THINK LIKE A BIG PART OF IT -- EVERYONE EACH PANELIST TOUCHED ON IS NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING UP. FOR AND LIKE EVEN NOW LIKE WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT -- THESE DIFFERENT LOANS I DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF PAYING THEM BACK LIKE TALKING ABOUT FORBEARANCE AND STUFF LIKE THAT I WAS LIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT MEANS SO -- I THINK THERE IS. FOR ME IT WAS REALLY JUST LIKE THIS IS MONEY IN FRONT OF ME THAT I NEED TO USED TO PAY FOR COLLEGE AND THAT'S WHY I DID AND I DID I THOUGHT IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER OPTIONS. BUT THERE WAS NO. GUIDANCE OR ASSISTANCE TO EXPLAIN WHAT IT MEANT TO TAKE OUT THESE LOANS HOW TO PAY THESE LOANS BACK -- WAYS TO LIKE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SUBSIDIZED UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS IT WAS REALLY JUST LIKE ME GOING ON GOOGLE TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. SO -- FOR MYSELF -- I I RECEIVED SEVERAL OFFERS FOR THE INSTITUTION THAT I APPLIED -- TO HOWEVER NONE OF THEM WERE ABLE TO OFFER ME OR TO SHOW ME WHAT MY OFFER WOULD BE BECAUSE OF MY DEFAULTED STUDENT LOANS THAT IS. AB AND AT FOR YOU MS ZAPCO CUBITS. I'M SO WHAT ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT THE I'M STATE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO SEE SACK IS ACTUALLY DOING TO SUPPORT STUDENTS. SO THEY HAVE. A BUNCH OF THINGS SO -- NUMBER ONE THEY ARE DOING THEIR SEARS SURVEY AGAIN WHICH HADN'T BEEN DONE I THINK ABOUT TWELVE YEARS -- TO A SURVEY STUDENTS AND GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE REAL TRUE COST OF COLLEGE ARE -- AND THEY ALSO ARE -- THEY'VE ADOPTED PRINCIPLES THAT ITALY WAS BACK IN NOVEMBER TO LOOK AT TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS AND ENSURE THAT. MORE STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE WHO AREN'T GETTING GRANTS ARE GETTING GRANTS SO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH -- LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE -- COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY IS STRENGTHENED IN OUR STATE. AT SO IT IS YOU MAY. BE AWARE TO SEE SACK I THINK CAN SOMETIMES IT CAN SEEM LIKE A BLACK HOLE FOR FOR STUDENTS NAVIGATES AND IT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT INFORMATION ABOUT ABOUT STUDENT LOANS AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE WHAT. YEAH WHAT'S INVOLVED BUT IT WOULD BE THINGS ACTUALLY MEAN AND THINGS ACTUALLY VERY MUCH TO NEXT GENS. LEADERSHIP THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION TO HELP. FILL THAT BLACK HOLE AND PROVIDE BETTER MORE ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION SAID RATHER THAN IT BEING KIND OF AN AFTER THOUGHT OR SORT OF A YOU KNOW HINTS AND TIPS. THAT IT'S IT'S A REALLY COR PART AS OF PLANNING. FOR WORK COLLEGE ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC THINGS SO IF IF THE SITE DOES HAVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SPEND TO DO A BETTER JOB. EXPLAINING THE PROCESS TO STUDENTS YOU KNOW ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THEM DO YOU WITH THOSE RESOURCES YEAH I MEAN I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM AND MAKE SURE THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO SHOW THAT FEDERAL LOANS ARE BY FAR THE SAFEST FORM OF BORROWING OVER PRIVATE LOANS THAT THEY COME WITH. CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT PRIVATE ONES DON'T COME WITH LIKE INCOME DRIVEN REPAYMENT PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS. BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS ENACTED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WHICH ON DOES REQUIRE CERTAIN COLLEGES TO LET STUDENTS KNOW IF THEY HAVE UNTAPPED FEDERAL AID. ELIGIBILITY SO -- I THINK CONNECTING -- THAT MANDATE WITH ON CONTINUING TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO STUDENTS ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SAFEST WAYS TO BORROW -- IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THAT NEED BASED AID THAT'S AVAILABLE -- RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ON WITH THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM THERE IS THAT IT MARCH SECOND DEADLINE TO GET AN ENTITLEMENT GRANT AND HOPEFULLY WITH ON THE ON GOING REFORM EFFORTS WILL BE ABLE. TO BROADEN HIS ACTUALLY ABLE TO RECEIVE A CAL GRANT BUT UNTIL THAT HAPPENS I ALSO HOPE PEOPLE KNOW THAT ON THERE IS THAT DEADLINE IF THEY APPLY. ON TIME AND THEY MEET BASIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THEY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A GRANT. AND IN TERMS OF THAT AND CAL GRANT EXPANSION THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE THING I I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS IS JUST HOW POWERFUL STUDENT ADVOCACY I THINK HAS BEEN ON THAT ISSUE. I'VE HAD STUDENTS. BUSY MY OFFICES AND OFFICES YOU KNOW ALL ACROSS THE CAPITAL FRIEND FROM UCI FROM. YOU KNOW FROM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FROM COLLEGES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. AND NOT MAKES A POWERFUL DIFFERENCE AND I THINK THAT. IT WE ALL KNOW THAT. POLITICIANS LISTEN. TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ADVOCATING AND I THINK THAT SOMETIMES AGAIN I'M USUALLY ASSEMBLY THAT. NO ONE PERSPECTIVE I HAVE IS I THINK ONE REASON THAT THIS ISSUE HAS NOT RECEIVED. ENOUGH ATTENTION IN THE ATTENTION THAT IT SHOULD IS BECAUSE STUDENTS AREN'T ALWAYS SEEN AS A POLITICALLY ENGAGED PART OF THE COMMUNITY AND SO I THINK. THE WAY THAT WERE SEEN MORE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT MORE STUDENT ADVOCACY. IT'S RAISING THIS AS AN ISSUE AND IT'S RAISING AS A CONVERSATION AND IT'S GOING TO GET. FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOLUTIONS BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT. THE STUDENT ADVOCACY PIECE IS IS PART OF THAT. VERY MUCH AGREED. RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR AND FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. I'M WE'RE GONNA. DO A SWAP ARE WE GONNA GET RANDY ON THE SCREEN OR ON THE PHONE -- OKAY WITH IT WITH A VIRTUAL VIRTUAL PRESENTER NEXT. RANDI WEINGARTEN IS THE AT PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. AND OUT ONE OF THE LEADING EXPERTS ON THIS SUBJECT SO. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE HER PERSPECTIVE. AS PART OF OUR CONVERSATION IF YOU ON THE PHONE -- SHE WILL BE MOMENTARILY OKAY. AND DÂN. SO WHILE WE'RE WHILE WE'RE GETTING MANY ON THE PHONE LET'S WALK AND OUR NEXT OUR NEXT PANELIST WE'VE GOT.

OKAY HEAR ME. SO MY NAME'S ADDRESS AND OF ALL AND I AM EIGHT UCSB ALSO USC ALUM I GOT MY GRADUATE DEGREE AT USC. AND I AM ALL THE THINGS THAT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE. GIVEN WHERE I WAY I CAME FROM. I AM A COASTER I'M AN IMMIGRANT FROM COSTA RICA FROM A FAMILY OF FARMERS. MY FAMILY GREW UP ON GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS AND I'LL TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS. AND I'M A FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT. TODAY I HAVE A THRIVING BEAUTIFUL FAMILY MY SON IS. FOR HIS NAME IS IN JOHNSON VS ONE AND SHE'S -- AND OVER FOR HER [INAUDIBLE] AND WE ARE RAISING THESE CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME. MY HUSBAND IS A POLICE OFFICER WHO PUTS HIS LIFE ON THE LINE EVERY DAY -- I'LL GET TO WHY IT WAS SO EMOTIONAL BUT TELL YOU ABOUT MY LIFE -- HE ISN'T ONE OF THE MOST CRIME RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN LOS ANGELES SO HE'S ALSO A PUBLIC SERVICE. I'VE FOUGHT REALLY HARD FROM EDUCATION. I GRADUATED FROM USC AND HAVE DEDICATED MY ENTIRE CAREER TO PUBLIC SERVICE. I WORK FOR THE VETERANS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AND IT WAS MY FIRST JOB OUT OF COLLEGE AND HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS. I'M LEADING THE TEAM TODAY THE DATA CAN START TIME TO INSURANCE VETERANS RECEIVE THE SERVICES THEY HAVE. THAT THEY ARE DESERVING OF IT WAS REALLY CLEAR TO ME THAT FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE. I WOULD NEED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL HELP. SO LOANS BECAME A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. AND THEY DO NOT THINK ANYTHING OF IT AT THE TIME. IN FACT EVERYONE I KNEW WAS ALREADY DOING IT AND EVERY FINANCIAL OFFICER EXPO TWO OR ALL OF THE BOOKS THAT WERE ON THE CAMPUS OF UC SB WEREN'T COURAGE IN YOUR TO TAKE. LOANS SO. I DID A AYE I WAS NEVER WARNED HIM AND TOOK THAT AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEBT TO GET FOR YOU AND SEE. BEFORE I HAD EVEN HAD A CREDIT CARD TO MY NAME. SO IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT I WAS HIRED AS A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE. ENTER MY RESEARCH OF MAKING THAT DECISION I REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. AND I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO HEAR THAT I CAN. GET THROUGH THAT BY DEDICATING MY TIME TO PUBLIC SERVICE. THE CONTACTED MY SERVICE ARE AT THE TIME. AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I SHOULD I WOULD INDEED IN FACT QUALIFIER HAD. SIGNED UP TO THE PAYMENT PLAN AND AND I SHOULD JUST KEEP GOING AND THEN AFTER HUNDRED TWENTY PAYMENTS IF YOU FIND. SO I CONTINUE TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS ON ABOUT PAYMENT PLAN. AND I REMEMBER I HAVE RELEASED DISTINCT PICTURE MY MIND A LOGGING ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WEBSITE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT A YEAR AFTER P. SLF HAD COME INTO EFFECT -- HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED IN FACT. AND I SAW FIVE PAYMENTS FIVE QUALIFYING TOWARD A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PAYMENTS. I'M ON TRACK -- EXCEPT I'M JUST KEEP GOING HUNDRED TWENTY PAYMENTS [INAUDIBLE] SO. HOWEVER MY LONG KEPT GETTING MOVED AROUND TO DIFFERENT SERVICERS I DO UNDERSTAND WHY IT DIDN'T BUT I JUST COULD LOG ON TO THE DIFFERENT WEBSITES WITH THE THEME OF CANCER. AND WHEN I LOG ON TO THOSE -- FINALLY IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN MY CURRENT SERVICER GOT A HOLD OF MY LOAN MY FED LOAN SERVICERS. MY FRIEND ON SERVICING. AND I CONTACTED THEM JUST AS I HAD ALL THE OTHER SERVICERS. AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT. I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MY PROGRESS WEST AS FAR AS BUT P. SLF -- I HAVE BEEN MAKING ON TIME PAYMENTS FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS AS A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE. AND I WAS DEVASTATED TO HEAR. THAT I DO NOT QUALIFY BUT I HAD ZERO PAYMENTS MADE TOWARDS MY HUNDRED TWENTY PAYMENTS. AND THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE I WAS UNDER THE WRONG. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS PAYMENT HOW WOULD DERAIL MY LOAN FORGIVENESS POUNDS I CHOSE THIS TIME WHEN I FIRST GRADUATED THE SERVICES HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM ME THAT THIS POWER. TAKE THAT OPTION AWAY AND EFFECTIVE TOLD ME DIFFERENTLY. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ON TRACK. SO I CONTINUED TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS AND I EVEN MADE PAYMENTS HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT DO SO THAT I CAN GET OUT OF THE STAFF FASTER. NO ONE IS SURE MY CLIFF NOTES ON MY CURRENT JOURNEY IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE NEARLY THIRTY HOURS I HAVE SPENT ON THE PHONE WITH STAFF. AND SUPERVISORS AFFECT LOAN. JUST TO TRY UNDERSTAND AND EDUCATE THE SERVICER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO SHARE WITH ME WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE. TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT. I DO FEEL THAT THIS IS BIGGER THAN ME I REPRESENT FRIENDS AT UCSB IN SANTA BARBARA I DON'T TAKE THIS FIGHT LIGHTLY. AND I NEED TO EDUCATE MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS AND MY CHILDREN. TO STAND UP THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET THROUGH [INAUDIBLE] LAST YEAR. I HEARD THE NEWS. THAT CONGRESS PASSED THE TEMPORARY. UP PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW CANDIDATES JUST EXACTLY OF MYSELF TO QUALIFY FOR A LOAN FORGIVENESS IF I MET CERTAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT PLAN I WAS AN AND I MET THEM. AT LEAST I THOUGHT. A CONTACT THE FINAL SERVICING AND THEY TOLD ME THAT. THE PROGRAM DID NOT EXIST. AND THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER RESOURCES. NATURALLY I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM. SO I JUST WASN'T GOING TO GIVE UP KEPT MONITORING THE WEBSITE. CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT HAD PASSED IT WOULD JUST WASN'T IMPLEMENTOR. NAY WAITED AND WAITED. THIS IS THE TIME SENSITIVE PROGRAM WITH LIMITED FUNDING AND I WAS AT THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. BUT WHEN I FINALLY FOUND THAT ON THE PROGRAM APPLICATION AVAILABLE ON THE FED LOAN SERVICING. THEY THEY I CALLED THEM AND THEY AGREED IT IT DID EXPECT EXCESS AND I SHOULD. APPLY. MAIN COURAGE ME. TO SO I APPLIED. THIS PAST NOVEMBER. WHEN I HAD MY TEN YEARS OF FEDERAL SERVICE? AND I FOLLOWED UP IN DECEMBER AND I WAS TOLD ON THE PHONE THAT I IN FACT WAS APPROVED. AND THEN I SHOW HERE SHORTLY ABOUT MY LOAN FORGIVENESS CRYING. ALL THESE YEARS A TIME INVESTED ALL THESE DECISIONS MADE FAR FAMILY. THAT CIRCLED AROUND THIS DEBT WOULD BE. WOULD JUST GO AWAY [INAUDIBLE] IN FEBRUARY. I RECEIVED THE NEWS THROUGH A LETTER THAT WHILE THEY DID MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS I WAS TONIGHT IT WAS NOT GIVEN A TO A TO A NEXT. SHOULD.

SO MY JOURNEY AS A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT NAVIGATING HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN FULL OF OBSTACLES BUT I NEVER COULD HAVE PREPARED FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO US LAST SEMESTER -- SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD -- ABOUT THE ARGOSY. SITUATION HAPPENED LAST SEMESTER -- SO I TENDED WESTERN STATE COLLEGE OF LAW WHICH IS AN ARGOSY INSTITUTION AND IN JANUARY. OUR STUDENT LOANS ESSENTIALLY WENT MISSING OVER SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE THAT WAS -- TO STUDENTS BASICALLY DISAPPEARED. AND ULTIMATELY ALL OF THE SCHOOLS AND IT UP IN A FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT AND ONE PERSON WAS APPOINTED AS A RECEIVER AND HE WAS IN CONTROL OF ALL THE FINANCES AND ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE SCHOOLS -- WE NEVER GOT THE MONEY WE NEVER GOT AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHERE THE MONEY WENT -- I LIKE MOST OTHER FULL TIME LAW STUDENTS RELY ON STUDENT LOANS FOR MY LIVING EXPENSES. SO WHEN -- THAT MONEY DIDN'T COME THROUGH IT AFFECTED MY LIFE SIGNIFICANTLY. AND BY MARCH ALMOST ALL OF THE ARGOSY SCHOOLS CLOSE MY LAW SCHOOL AND ONE OTHER SCHOOL REMAIN. I HAD TO ACTUALLY INTERVENE IN THE FEDERAL COURT AND GET A JUDGE TO ORDER THE SCHOOL TO REMAIN OPEN. AND THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY I'M GOING TO GRADUATE TOMORROW -- THE RECEIVER HIMSELF HAS STATED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TOLD HIM TO USE OUR MONEY ON EXPENSES OF THE SCHOOLS RATHER THAN PASSED THE MONEY THAT WAS OWED TO US. WE TO THIS DAY WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH IS -- I'M CURRENTLY BEING REPRESENTED BY AN SLT AND AND WE'RE TRYING TO OBTAIN INFORMATION. REGARDING WHAT HAPPENED TO OURS. THE SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS BASICALLY JUST VANISHED WITH NO EXPLANATION. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. AND AND THEY'RE SO ARE THEY TRYING TO COLLECT. THAT LOAN FROM YOU SO THAT PART I I PERSONALLY HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TELL ME THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY -- AS FAR AS I KNOW ONLY THE STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY RECEIVED THEIR MONEY RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM EDUCATION THING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY YEAH [INAUDIBLE] OKAY. ALL RIGHT SO YOU WILL KEEP US POSTED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IS THAT UNFOLDS THAT'S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS I'M SHARIA. ALL RIGHT I'M NOW WITH BRING HERE FROM RACHEL GREEN BOX. HI -- MY NAME'S RACHEL GREEN BOMB. I AM THIRTY NINE YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES AND I WORK AS A CROWD MEGA SELF DEFENSE INSTRUCTOR AND LICENSING REPRESENTATIVE. I'D LIKE TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT INCURRED A PREDATORY A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL. IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CAREER IN VISUAL JOURNALISM. I LOOK FOR PROGRAMS ONLINE AND CAME ACROSS BROOKS INSTITUTE FOR PHOTOGRAPHY. BROOKS PROMISED AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION THAT WOULD LEAD OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FIELD AND POINTED TO HIGH EMPLOYMENT RATES AND FUTURE EARNINGS. BUT I LATER LEARNED WERE FALLS. BROOKS MADE IT SEEM THEIR ADMISSIONS PROGRAM IT WAS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY WERE ACTIVELY RECRUITING AS MANY STUDENTS AS THEY COULD ENROLL. WHEN I APPLIED I WAS ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY? I ATTENDED THE BROOKS INSTITUTE OF PHOTOGRAPHY INVENTOR CALIFORNIA FROM 200-032-2000 SIX AND I GRADUATED WITH A BACHELORS OF ARTS DEGREE IN VISUAL JOURNALISM. BROOKS COUNSELORS A STEERED ME TOWARDS FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LOANS TO PAY FOR THIS PROGRAM AND PRESSURED ME TO TAKE OUT THE MAXIMUM. AMOUNT OF LOANS AVAILABLE. THEY PRESENTED ME WITH LOAN APPLICATION FORMS AND TOLD ME THAT THE JOB THAT I WOULD ACCESS AFTER GRADUATING WITH A LONG WAY TO REPAY THESE LOANS. AND AND MUCH MORE. THEY ALSO MUST LEAD LEAD MISS LET ME ABOUT THE COST RAISING THE PRICE OF TUITION IF WE TOOK OFF A TWO MONTH SESSION AND THEN RE ENROLLED FOR THE NEXT SESSION. BROOKS BUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON STUDENTS TO TAKE OUT THESE LOANS AND MY MOTHER HAD TO CO SIGN FOR THESE LOANS IN ORDER FOR ME TO QUALIFY. I ENDED UP TAKING ABOUT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL AND PRIVATE LOANS. THAT I'M STILL TRYING TO PAY OFF. MEANWHILE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ANY PERMANENT POSITION IN VISUAL JOURNALISM AND HAVE NOT MADE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS DOING TEMPORARY PROJECTS. THIS IS TRULY NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED AFTER RECEIVING AN A ON MY GRADUATION PROJECT. FILMING IN PRODUCING A SHORT DOCUMENTARY ON HIS BILL LAWS TWO THOUSAND SIX ATTACK ON ISRAEL FROM LEBANON. WELL I WAS IT WHILE I WAS AT BROOKS IT SEEMED LIKE THE SCHOOL WAS MORE INTERESTED IN CHARGING ME THAN PROVIDING ME WITH A GOOD EDUCATION. I PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO AND TAKEN MANY GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES COURSES THAT WOULD EASILY HAVE BEEN GIVEN CREDIT. AT ANY OTHER COLLEGE. YES BROOKS REFUSED TO ACCEPT THESE CREDITS AND BEING ME TAKE UNNECESSARY COURSES UNRELATED TO MY MAJOR IN ORDER TO SATISFY. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. THIS JUST SEEM TO NOT LIKE ANOTHER WAY FOR BOOKS TO GOUGE ME FOR MORE MONEY. I LATER FOUND OUT FROM CLASSMATES THAT NOT ONLY WOULD CREDITS NOT TRANSFER INTO BROOKE'S. BUT THEY DID SCHOOLS WOULD NOT ACCEPT TRANSFER CREDITS OUT OF BROOKS EVEN THOUGH BURKE SAYS MISS TOLD US THAT THEY WHAT. THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT ANCHORED FOR USELESS AND REGARD REGRETTABLE EDUCATION AT BROOKS HAS PREVENTED ME FROM MOVING AHEAD. FINANCIALLY TO THIS DAY. WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE BAR DEFENSE REPAIRMAN -- DISCHARGE PROGRAM IN 200-020-0016 I SUBMITTED MY APPLICATION TO THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND HAVE YET TO HEAR BACK. IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO DEAL WITH MY LOOMING DEBT I SIGNED UP WITH THE DEBT RELIEF COMPANY THAT TAKES HALF OF MY PAYCHECK EVERY MONTH TO TRY AND SETTLE MY LOANS. DESPITE TELLING ME THEY WOULD SETTLE ON MY LOANS I'M STILL BEING PURSUED BY DEBT COLLECTORS FOR TWO OF THOSE LOANS AND I'M NOT SURE THE DEBT RELIEF COMPANY IS HELPING ME AS MUCH AS PROMISED. THE DEBT COLLECTORS OF THREATEN ME WITH HER HOUSING CALLS AND OVER CHARGE ME FOR MY LOANS. I'M THIRTY NINE YEARS OLD AN IRON ABOUT. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. HALF OF WHICH GOES TOWARDS PAYING OFF MY STUDENT LOANS. SOME WEEKS I LITERALLY DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO BUY GROCERIES AND I SURVIVE OFF OF PROTEIN BARS. WHILE I DO ENJOY MY JOB. IT'S COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO WHAT I STUDIED AT BROOKS I HAVE POOR CREDIT I DON'T OWN ANYTHING BUT MY CAR WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN MY MOTHER'S NAME. AND I RENT A ROOM IN A HOUSE FROM MY FRIEND'S MOTHER. I DOUBT THAT I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO START A FAMILY WITH THIS THIS FINANCIAL SITUATION. OR EVEN JUST GOT MY OWN APARTMENT. THIS IS NOT WHERE I THOUGHT I WOULD BE WHEN I STARTED STUDYING AT BROOKS INSTITUTE. BUT THIS IS WHERE MY STUDENT LOAN THAT HAS LEFT ME. THANK YOU I'M THANKS FOR CHAU. I DID MENTION THAT WE DO HAVE. SOME BILLS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE TRYING TO CRACK DOWN ON SOME OF THE UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICES AS SOME OF THESE FOR PROFIT COLLEGES. THEY REALIZE THAT'S PROBABLY.

I'M YEAH ALONG WITH SO SO MANY OTHERS -- SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING A MOMENT TO JOIN US AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND THAT LOOK FOR TO CONNECTING WITH YOU SOON. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL OR VERY PLAYFUL. RIGHT THAT'S HERE LAST YEAR. YEAH. NOW BACK TO OUR DELIGHT I BELIEVE. CATHOLIC I CAN BE HEARD THEIR YES I DID GO -- TO BOTH ITT TECH AND WESTWOOD COLLEGE AND AND I EVEN WENT HERE. WAY BACK IN [INAUDIBLE] NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE BEEN AWHILE [INAUDIBLE] ANTEATER -- I ONCE FOR ONE SEMESTER ALRIGHT. AND THEN THE MONEY STOPPED -- THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY THAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD -- PUT ASIDE FOR NOT ONLY ME BUT TO ALL MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. MY GRANDFATHER FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT WE ALL. GO TO COLLEGE SO HE BOUGHT -- TO WHAT'S A LITTLE PIECES OF REAL ESTATE IN GAS STATIONS JUST BUSTED IS HOME ALL OF HIS LIFE AND THE MONEY FOR US TO GO TO COLLEGE WAS PRETTY MUCH SET. WHAT HE HAD NOT COUNTED ON ONLY PASSED AWAY WAS THAT -- MY FATHER WOULD HAVE BEEN SELF NAMED AS EXECUTOR OF THE ESTATE AND LOSE MOST OF IT IN THE STOCK MARKET [INAUDIBLE] WELL. SO. ARE YOU SEE I CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT AND I GOT A LOT FOR MY MUSE. BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE FOR A A FEW YEARS. AND THEN I FINALLY PULLED OUT AND WAS ABLE -- TO OBTAIN SOME SKILL THROUGH A FRIEND AS AN INSTALL OR SATELLITE SYSTEMS THESE WOULD NOT BE THE A SMALL ONE YOU SEE NOWADAYS THESE WOULD BE. WELL FOOT MOTORIZED ISSUES THAT SWUNG BACK AND FORTH IN IT ONE OF TWENTY FIVE SATELLITES. AND I GOOD GOOD. AND I STARTED MAKING MONEY AT IT. I THOUGHT LIFE WAS GOING TO BE GOOD -- BUT TO THE ECONOMY STARTED FALLING APART -- AROUND TWO THOUSAND NOT BADLY BUT ENOUGH THAT. YOU COULD SEE THE TECH BUBBLE WAS GOING TO BURST SO I DECIDED -- WELL I'VE GOT SOME MAMA KNOWLEDGE IN COMMUNICATIONS HERE I SHOULD PROBABLY UP TRY AND EXPAND THAT INTO -- SOME IT WORK AND GET. ALL THE ADVERTISING THAT I WAS SEEING FOR ITT TECH AND WESTWOOD COLLEGE AND THEY WERE JUST. REALLY GLORIA SLICK WELL PRODUCED COMMERCIALS. HOW CAN I NOT BUY INTO IT -- SO I WOULD TO HEAR A SALES PITCH FROM ACCOUNTS WERE AT ITT TECH HE TOLD ME EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR THAT ALL MANNER OF JOBS WOULD BE BESTOWED UPON ME IF I JUST GOT THIS EDUCATION. AND MONEY WOULD BE NO PROBLEM JUST SIGN HERE TAKE OUT THE STUDENT LOANS YOU'LL SEE A COUNSELOR SHE'LL BEYOND. WHICH SHE DID. SIGN A LOT OF PAPERWORK NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT IT AS I SHOULD OF SO I GOT TO ACCEPT SOME BLAME THEIR I JUST HAVE THIS BLIND. THOUGHT THAT -- WELL I'LL GET A REALLY GOOD JOB IN THEM I'LL PAY BACK THE LOANS SEE NO PROBLEM. WELL. AS AN ITT LESSEN THE YEAR BEFORE IS WILLING TO THROW IN THE TOWEL THERE THE CLASSROOM LIGHTING WAS POOR. THE TEXT BOOKS WERE NOT ON PAR WITH ANYTHING I HAD EVER SEEN THEY WERE LOADED WITH ERRORS. ARE INDEED WE SPEND A LOT MORE CLASS TIME CORRECTING TEXTBOOK ERRORS LEAVING. LEAVING YOU WITH SO LITTLE OF A CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE HE WONDERED WHAT YOU SHOWED UP. INSTRUCTOR COMMUNICATION MADE IT CLEAR THAT ENGLISH WAS NOT THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE AND A LOT OF CASES. CONSTANT REQUESTS FROM STUDENTS FOR THE INSTRUCTOR TO REPEAT. WHAT HE SAID -- MET WITH SCORN TO SAY THE LEAST. I FINALLY TOSSED UP MY HANDS AND I WAS RIGHT FOR YET ANOTHER SALES PITCH FROM CROSSTOWN RIVAL. WESTWOOD COLLEGE. I PRETTY MUCH WENT FROM THE FRYING PAN. INTO THE DEEP FRYER. SO -- THE WEST PERSONNEL. ASKED IF THEY COULD DO BETTER AND THEN ITT TECH -- OF COURSE WE WERE ASSURED THAT THEY COULD. WE WERE AGAIN GIVEN A SPIEL ABOUT THE SKILLS OF TOMORROW. WHICH AT THE END OF MY EDUCATION WOULD TRANSLATE INTO AN OFFER FOR A MINIMUM WAGE JOB OFFERING A WHOLE LOT LESS THAN WHAT I WAS CURRENTLY MAKING IS A SATELLITE DISH INSTALLER. SO I WAS LEFT WONDERING HOW WAS IT LIKE. INTEL THIS. STUDENT DEBT FOR JOBS THE JUST APPARENTLY ARE NOT THERE OR PIECE OF LITTLE THEY'RE NOT WORTH GOING AFTER -- I DID MANAGE TO EEK OUT PAYMENTS HOWEVER TO STUDENT LOAN PROVIDERS I WAS STILL WORKING AS A SATELLITE DISH -- TECHNICIAN AND WHAT I DID NOT THINK ABOUT THE TIME WAS THAT I REALLY WAS NOT MAKING ANY OF THE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS I WAS ONLY REALLY. PAYING OFF LARGELY THE INTEREST SO THE DEBT KEPT. MOUNTING AND MOUNTING AND MOUNTING BUT AGAIN I FIGURED WELL THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT SURELY IF I JUST KEEP AT IT. THIS WALL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. AT SOME POINT. THEN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION HEADS AND EVERYTHING FELL APART -- I COULD MAKE PAYMENTS ANYMORE COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM WAS THE EVER INCREASING RANCH. MEANING I WAS THROWING NEARLY BUT OUT. OF THE PROBLEM BEING I WAS TRAVELING TO DO A LOT OF SERVICE CALL WORK THE TRAFFIC IN CALIFORNIA GOT SO BAD THAT WHERE IS I'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. TO ME BEFORE SERVICE CALLS A DAY -- WITH THE TRAFFIC BECOMING AWARE ONCE THEN I GOT TO SERVICE GOALS AND FUNNY JUST ONE SERVICE CALL. I CAN JUSTIFY EIGHT FOUR HOURS OF ROUND TRIP TRAVEL FOR A JOB IT MIGHT TAKE ME. TWENTY TO FORTY MINUTES. IT IT. IT WAS THAT KIND OF MATH SO. ADDITIONALLY MY SAVINGS FROM COVERING THE SHORTFALLS WERE NOW EXHAUSTED I TOOK A JOB WITH EIGHTEEN T. THAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO WORK OUT IT DIDN'T. THIS DID NOT STOP NAVIGANT THE DEBT COLLECTOR FROM SEIZING MY TAX REFUND AND FURTHER COMPOUNDING MY FINANCIAL ROSE -- FINANCIAL WOES. AFTER ANOTHER RENT INCREASE I A WAS EVICTED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND BEGAN LIVING IN THE BACK OF MY PICKUP TRUCK [INAUDIBLE] DURING. GOOD TO UC IRVINE. YOU WORK FOR AL DAVIS OF THE RAIDERS. AND NOW HERE YOU ARE IN THE BACK OF THE PICK UP TRUCK. STARING UP AT THE CAMPER SHELL CEILING AND THE RAIN IS FALLING HOW DID YOU. GET HERE. AND I'M STILL. GETTING NOTICES FROM HAVING INTO ABOUT -- ABOUT THE DEAD -- I FINALLY HAD TO FILE A PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THE MONEY HAD JUST SITUATION JUST FALLING APART. ALL TOGETHER. AND THIS DID NOT REFLECT WELL ON MY STUDENT LOAN DEBT. INDEED WHAT HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE NOW THE END HAS REPORTED ME AS AS A DEBTOR IT HAS AFFECTED MY CREDIT. AND WHERE IS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CHANCES FOR SOME HIGHLINE. REALLY WELL PAYING JOBS. UNFORTUNATELY THEY REQUIRE SOMETHING CALLED A SECURITY CLEARANCE. IF YOU'RE APPLYING FOR SECURITY CLEARANCE ONE OF THE CONDITIONS IS. YOU ARE. HOW FAR BACK CREDIT? SO I DON'T KNOW I JUST FEEL LIKE THE BANKS ARE AGAIN IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING AND THEY GOT COMMON THEY GOT YOU GO -- ONE AT THIS POINT TIME UNEMPLOYMENT I'M PUSHING SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYMENT OFFICER OFFERS ARE PRETTY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TO COME BY -- AGAIN I'VE HAD ONE JOB THAT LOOK REALLY PROMISING I PASSED EXAMINATION FOR BUT BECAUSE OF HIS STUDENT LOAN DEBT BUT I AM JUST NOT ABLE TO GET A HANDLE ON AGAIN GETTING A SECURITY CLEARANCE IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. I ALSO ATTACHED TO THIS BAD WESTWOOD COLLEGE WAS FAMOUS FOR THEIR WESTWOOD PROMISE -- THAT WAS THERE'D SPECIAL DEAL WHERE THEY PROMISED YOU THAT IF. ANY COURSE MATERIALS CHANGED HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE COURSE OVER AGAIN AT NO CHARGE. YOU WOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY LAB FEES. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TAKE THE COURSE OVER AGAIN AT A SCHOOL THAT'S CLOSED. SO THERE GOES THAT PROMISE -- IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO APPLY FOR A JOB WITH WEST WOULD ON YOUR RESUME YOU SPEND MORE TIME EXPLAINING. THE SCHOOL IN SELLING YOURSELF. AND THAT PUTS YOU AT AN IMMEDIATE JOB DISADVANTAGE. I'M STUCK WITH A WORTHLESS DEGREE FROM A SCHOOL THAT DOESN'T EXIST. GIVEN MY AGE AND THE FACT THAT BOTH PARENTS AND BOTH MY PARENTS PASSED AWAY BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY ONE MY BIGGEST FEAR NOW IS THE STEP. IS GOING TO FOLLOW ME TO MY SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS WHICH WILL BE ATTACHED AND FINALLY TO MY GRAVE. SO. I'M LEFT. NOT KNOWING REALLY WHAT TO DO. ARMED WITH DEFINITELY THINK WITH THIS PANEL HEARD FROM YOU. GOT A REAL CROSS SECTION. OF JUST YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE -- STRUGGLING WITH WHEN IT COMES. TO ARE BATTLING WITH STUDENT LEARNED THAT IN SOME CASES STUDENT LOAN DEBT THAT SEEMS AS IF. IT'S BEEN FRAUDULENTLY ACCRUED. I'M I'M HOPING THAT OUR NEXT PANEL CAN PROVIDE. IN A GLIMMER OF HOPE FOR IS SOME LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL -- SO ARE THE SUBJECT OF OUR NEXT PANEL IS EFFORTS TO SUPPORT STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS SO THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU. FOR BEING HERE AND FOR BEING PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES WITH US AND I'M. LIKE I SAID I'M IN A COMMITTED. TO MAKING SURE THAT YOU WHATEVER I CAN DO IS A CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND WHATEVER THIS THE ASSEMBLY CAN DO THAT WE ARE DOING THAT TO PROVIDE. RELIEF AND ENSURE THAT THAT MORE FOLKS ARE BEING VICTIMIZED IN THIS WAY. ALRIGHT AND OUR SERVER NEXT PANEL WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME AND SUZANNE MARTIN DALE. WHO IS THE SENIOR POLICY COUNSEL AND WESTERN STATES LEGISLATIVE MANAGER AT THE ADVOCACY DIVISION OF CONSUMER REPORTS? JONATHAN GO LATER THE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW SO YOU SEE I LAW SCHOOL. JUST MAINLY IT WAS A STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES. OF LOS ANGELES. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR CONVENING THIS COMMITTEE -- I THINK YOU'RE LEADERSHIP IS ALREADY BEING -- DEMONSTRATED ON IN PARTICULAR BY HIGHLIGHTING THE STORIES OF BORROWERS. STUDENTS AND STUDENT BORROWERS AND GIVING THEM A PLATFORM A PUBLIC PLATFORM IS BEING LIVE STREAMED UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TALK ABOUT THEIR LIVES EXPERIENCES WITH STUDENT DEBT I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND DEMONSTRATES WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE A LEADER. I SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TAKE STEPS -- CRUCIAL MEANINGFUL STEPS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CHOOSING JUST TRYING TO GET AN EDUCATION -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO GO INTO DEBT TO DO IT. SO MY NAME IS SUZANNE MARTIN DEL -- WORK FOR COME TO ADVOCACY DIVISION OF CONSUMER REPORTS I'M ALSO A LAWYER AND WENT TO LAW SCHOOL THEREFORE I AM ALSO ONE OF YOU I HAVE STUDENT AT I HAVE A LOT OF IT -- AND WE ARE NOT ALONE -- AND SO DON'T EVER FEEL LIKE IT'S YOUR FAULT BECAUSE YOU'RE IN DEBT -- AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO ARE TRYING TO WORK TO ESTABLISH SOLUTIONS -- AND THAT CAN NEVER THINK FULLY MAKE PEOPLE HOLE FOR HAVING HAD TO GO INTO DEBT TO GET THEIR EDUCATION BUT THEY CAN HOPEFULLY MAKE THINGS BETTER. SOME OF THE STORIES ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL. AMPLY DEMONSTRATE WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO STEP UP TO THE PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY HOLD DAT IT IS A CRISIS. AND YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION THINK THAT THAT'S IT'S A CRISIS BECAUSE LARGE AND BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WHOLE STORY WE HAVE A REPAYMENT CRISIS AND IN FACT PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY SMALL BUT LOAN BALANCES. RELATIVELY SPEAKING ARE OFTEN THE ONES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO FALL BEHIND -- AS PREVIOUS PANEL SAID A HALF MILLION PEOPLE ARE BEHIND RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA ON THEIR LOANS AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE LOANS ARE FEDERAL LOANS. THEY HAVE PROGRAMS AND BENEFITS ATTACHED TO THEM THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A FEDERAL LOAN. IN DELINQUENCY OR DEFAULT BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS AT LEAST POTS YOUR PAYMENTS THERE INCOME DRIVEN REPAYMENT PLANS A TIED TO YOUR INCOME AND THAT CAN MAKE YOUR PAYMENT AS LOW AS ZERO DOLLARS. AND YOU'RE STILL CURRENT SO WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRY TO EDUCATE YOURSELF AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL HAVE ALREADY DEMONSTRATED TO INCREDIBLE LENGTHS TO WHICH THEY HAD TO GO TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES. BUT THAT'S WHAT. A NOTE THAT WAS SORRY. THE YEAH THE UNIVERSE IS GIVING OKAY. BUT THE POINT IS. NO THE BURDEN SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BORROWER TO HAVE TO LEARN STUDENT LOAN LAW OKAY THE BURDEN SHOULD NOT BE ON INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE TO HAVE TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS CONTRACTING WITH MULTI MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES NOW DO YOU JUST ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS ON THE FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED LIST YEAH NOW HAVING IT. RIGHT THERE GET MADE THEY'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OFF THE BACKS OF BORROWERS SO WHY DON'T THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THE BENEFITS AND THE RIGHTS THEY SHOULD HAVE WE HAVE RIGHTS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE RIGHTS AS BORROWER SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS THAT THERE IS NO INDUSTRY WIDE CONSUMER PROTECTION FRAMEWORK WITH ENFORCEABLE LEGAL RIGHTS CURRENTLY APPLICABLE TO STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS -- A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE IN UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AT THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARD CREATING REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THESE COMPANIES BUT THAT WORK UNDER THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN UTTERLY SCRAPPED. SO WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO. CALIFORNIA CAN DO WHAT IT DID. AND VERY ANALOGOUS SITUATION FOR HOMEOWNERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORTGAGE AND FORECLOSURE CRISIS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE STEPPED UP BECAUSE THEY WERE HERE IN STORY AFTER STORY. OF HOMEOWNER WITH A MORTGAGE LOAN AND MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICER THAT WASN'T WORKING WITH THEM ARE HELPING THEM AND WAS NOT INCENTIVIZED IN ANY WAY TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY FORECLOSURES SO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TWELVE PASSED THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER. RIGHT THAT MADE IT SERVICES HAVE TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION I GET INFORMATION HAVE A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT SOME REALLY BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM LOSING THEIR HOMES. WELL GUESS WHAT DOES NOT SOUND FAMILIAR WE HAVE LOAN SERVICERS WERE THE GATEKEEPERS TO YOU ACCESSING YOUR RIGHTS AS AN EDUCATION LOAN BORROWER AND THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO HELP YOU. SO MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM ARE WORKING ON LEGISLATION HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AB THREE SEVENTY SIX THE STUDENT BORROWER BILL OF RIGHTS. THIS BILL WOULD BE A FIRST IN THE NATION PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE AFFIRMATIVE ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS FOR BORROWERS SO WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. IT WOULD REQUIRE SERVICES TO HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS TO TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT PS A LOT IS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT TEMPORARY EXTENSION THAT YES IT DOES EXIST -- TO KNOW ABOUT DIFFERENT PAYMENT PLANS TO KNOW ABOUT SPECIAL. SPECIAL NEEDS AND RIGHTS THAT MAY APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THE MILITARY WHO HAVE A DISABILITY BECAUSE SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE DISABLED YOU CAN GET YOUR LOAN CANCEL COMPLETELY -- PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY OTHER SPECIAL POPULATIONS IT WOULD PROHIBIT ABUSIVE PRACTICES ABUSIVE PRACTICES BEING DEFINED AS YOU LOAN SERVICER YOU CAN'T TAKE IT ON REASONABLE ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE IN ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WORLD'S GOING ON WITH THEIR STUDENT LOANS. AND THIS MAY LEAD THEM ASTRAY -- THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ALSO CREATE A BAR WITH ADVOCATE AT OUR EXISTING STATE FINANCIAL REGULATORS WOULD BE A POINT PERSON WHO WOULD BE A PUBLIC WATCHDOG -- POLICING THE INDUSTRY AND MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE RIGHTS RESPECTED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WAS SUCH A DISSIDENT BECAUSE OF THESE STUDIES MINIMUM STANDARDS. AND WE MAKE THEM ENFORCEABLE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT. YOU CAN YOU CAN GO AFTER THEM AND YOU CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IF THEY'RE NOT TREATING YOU PROPERLY US AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A HUGE -- HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP FORWARD AND AGAIN TO PROTECT THE THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION AND COUNTING PEOPLE WHO ARE A WHOLE LOANS IN THE STATE -- TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE WHEN LOAN SERVICERS FEEL YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY THEY HAVE FAILED TO MANY PEOPLE IT ADDS INSULT TO INJURY IT INCREASES THE OVERALL COST. OF GETTING AN EDUCATION AND IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE -- SO -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS OF THE COMMITTEE -- TODAY AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU AS WE TRY TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT EXISTING CRISIS FOR THOSE WHO CURRENTLY HOLD STUDENT DEBT THANK YOU SO MUCH TURNER'S. WILL IN THANK YOU AND YOU AND YOU DESCRIBED I THINK THE INTENT AND THE PROVISIONS OF THE STUDENT BORROWED BILL OF RIGHTS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY AND DIED. ON MARCH AND WHO IS THE THE PRINCIPAL AUTHOR OF THAT BILL IS PART IS PART OF OUR COMMITTEE SO WE ARE. I'M REALLY PLEASED TO WORKING WORKING WITH HAND. TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THIS CRISIS AND DO WHAT WE CAN IN CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS AND YOUR IN THE CONTEXT OF OF OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. RIGHT I NEXT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM JONATHAN LATER. GOOD MORNING AND AND THANK YOU TO THE ORGANIZERS OF THIS EVENT. MADAM CHAIR FOR PER BRINGING US TOGETHER TODAY -- MY NAME'S JONATHAN LATER I TEACH HERE AT UCI SCHOOL OF LAW AND IN MY VERY BRIEF REMARKS AND MINDFUL OF THE TIME KEEPER OVER THERE -- I WANT TO MAKE THREE POINTS -- AND GIVE UP I JUST A HINT OF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE -- AND ANTI THOSE THREE POINTS -- TO A NEW PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THIS LAW SCHOOL AND THE STUDENTS ARE PROTECTION CENTER. WAS THREE POINTS ARE THE NEED FOR REFORM OF LOT THEY NEED FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT. AND THE DANGER POSED BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES AND ACTION. I SHOULD CONFESS UP FRONT I'M A STUDENT LOAN BAR RECOVERING STUDENT ON BAR OR MYSELF. IT TOOK FIFTEEN YEARS. I BORROWED A FRACTION OF WHAT MY STUDENTS NOW HAVE TO BORROW TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. SO TO BE CLEAR THE AVAILABILITY OF STUDENT LOANS IS PUT HIGHER EDUCATION WITHIN REACH OF GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINANCE THE COST WE SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. BUT AS A POLICY TOOL WHAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY IS THAT THAT IS VERY MUCH A TWO EDGED INSTRUMENT BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN IMPOSED ON THE BORROWER'S. WHEN FEDERAL LAWMAKERS A HALF CENTURY AGO -- LAID THE FOUNDATION OF THE FEDERAL STUDENT AID REGIME THAT WE STILL HAVE TODAY THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE LOANS WOULD BE THE KEY POLICY INTERVENTION THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THE GRANTS. TODAY WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE HARMS THAT DAD CAUSES SO WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN HERE MIGHT THREE POINTS FIRST REFORM OF LAW. THE PROBLEMS THAT THE PRIOR SPEAKERS HAVE DESCRIBED IN VISCERAL DETAIL -- HAVE ALLUDED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING PROPOSALS FOR FIXES THAT IT AB. CAN HELP STUDENTS COPE WITH INDEBTEDNESS THIS INCLUDES A VARIETY OF A RANGE OF OPTIONS FROM THE INCREMENTAL TO THE GAME CHANGING. THAT LIST INCLUDES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL CHANGES TO THE BANKRUPTCY CODE TO MAKE DISCHARGE MORE POSSIBLE. AT THE STATE LEVEL STRENGTHENING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS AND THE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT. AND COMING UP WITH A WORKABLE HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCE REGIME THAT RE ALLOCATE THE COST BACK FROM STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO THE TAXPAYER BECAUSE THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS WE ALL BENEFIT WHEN HIGHER EDUCATION IS ACCESSIBLE ON A FAIR AND EQUITABLE BASIS. SO EXPANDING THE CAL GRANT RIGHT ONE OF THE BILLS IT'S CURRENTLY -- OUT THERE. AND THEN SOME MORE INNOVATIVE OPTIONS LIKE FRONT LOADING THE PELL GRANT -- I WAS TALKING WITH A COLLEAGUE BEFORE THIS EVENT STARTED ABOUT. IF THE CAL GRANT WERE STRUCTURED SO THAT IT PROVIDED MORE CASH UP FRONT IN THE EARLY YEARS WHICH IS WHEN STUDENTS -- THIS MORE OFTEN MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN THE PAYMENT -- THEN IF THEY HAVE TO LEAVE SCHOOL FOR ANY REASON THE LOAN APPLICATION THEY WOULD FACE WOULD BE THAT MUCH LATER. SECOND THE NEED FOR MORE AND BETTER EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT ALL OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF STUDENT INDEBTEDNESS. WE AS SCHOLARS DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE LONGITUDINAL DATA TRACKING STUDENT BORROWERS OVER TIME AS COMPLETELY AS WE WOULD LIKE. SO WE NEED BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ON WHO BORROWS HOW MUCH TO GO TO WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL TO EXPERIENCE WHAT KIND OF OUTCOME TO A COMPLETE OR NOT. AND TO LAND WHAT KIND OF JOB EARNING WHAT KIND OF INCOME WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION. DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE IN POSITIVE INTERVENTIONS LIKE THESE I'VE ALREADY ALLUDED TO IS THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. THIRD WE NEED FOR STEPPED UP STATE ACTION IN LIGHT OF THE FEDERAL ABSENCE. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON IS NOT ONLY NOT TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY STUDENT INDEBTEDNESS IS ACTIVELY WORKING TO UNDO POLICIES THAT WERE INTENDED TO MEDICATE HARM UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED LAST MONTH AT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT DID NOT APPROVE A SINGLE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN RELIEF IN THE SECOND HALF OF LAST YEAR. FOR STUDENTS WHO CLAIM TO BE VICTIMS OF FRAUD AND TRIED TO GET OUT FROM UNDER THEIR DEBT. THE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO ABANDONING OBAMA HERE RULES AND INTENDED TO CONSTRAIN FOR PROFIT INSTITUTION WHOSE STUDENTS DISPROPORTIONATELY BORROW DISPROPORTIONATELY BORROW MORE AND DISPROPORTIONATELY DEFAULT. I DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO TALK ABOUT HOW POORLY THE DEPARTMENT IS HANDLED THE PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM BUT YOU'VE GOTTEN A HINT OF THAT ALREADY. THIS LAW SCHOOL IS PARTNERED WITH THE STUDENT BAR PROTECTION SENATE INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS THAT I'VE OUTLINED BOTH BY STUDY OF LAW. AND MY RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF INDEBTEDNESS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL THINK OF US GOING FORWARD MADAM CHAIR -- AS A RESOURCE -- AS YOU THINKING ABOUT WAYS THE STATE CAN CONTINUE ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM OF STUDENT DEBT. THANK YOU. SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT OFFER AND SO GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP THAT THAT YOU HAVE HAVE SHOWN ALREADY ON THE SUBJECT AND THE FOR TO WORKING TOGETHER TO CONTINUE WITH US FORWARD THANK YOU. I'M NOT OUR LAST SPEAKER TODAY I'D JOSEPHINE LADY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS JOSEPHINE LEE AND I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE LEGAL AID FOUNDATION OF LOS ANGELES -- WHICH HAS LED EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA NATIONWIDE. ADVOCATE FOR WIDESPREAD STUDENT DEBT RELIEF -- THE THE PROVISION OF FREE LEGAL SERVICES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. NEARLY ALL OF MY CLIENTS ARE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS -- WHICH MEANS MANY OF THEM ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR A LITTLE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE VETERANS AND SINGLE PARENTS. THESE SAME STUDENTS ARE THE PRIME TARGETS OF PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WE'VE ALREADY HEARD STORIES -- FROM FORMER STUDENTS -- AND I HAVE CLIENTS WHO WENT TO BROOKS INSTITUTE OF PHOTOGRAPHY ITT TECH EVEREST COLLEGE MARANELLO -- AS WE'VE HEARD THE SCHOOLS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND OFTEN HAVE VERY POOR OUTCOMES FOR THEIR STUDENTS -- FOLKS TO GO TO A FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE TWICE IS MORE LIKELY TO DEFAULT ON THEIR FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS THAN THEIR PEERS AT A NONPROFIT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE STAGGERING NUMBER OF FOLKS ARE INTO FALL IN CALIFORNIA BUT I WANTED TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFAULT. ARE AT LONG TERM AND VERY SEVERE I'LL BORROW WHO'S IN THE FALL -- FACES A LIFETIME OF WAGE GARNISHMENT ONSETS OF TAX REFUNDS AND SOCIAL SECURITY INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY. BAR WAS WONDERFUL AS WE'VE HEARD ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FOR THEIR FINANCIAL AID SO THEY CAN'T CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION -- TO BETTER THEIR ECONOMIC PROSPECTS -- THEIR CREDIT IS RUINED -- WHICH AFFECTS EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND JUST THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES -- WE'VE HEARD BRIEFLY ABOUT THE EFFORTS TO HI DISCHARGED STUDENT LOANS IN BANKRUPTCY BUT BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT UNDUE HARDSHIP STANDARD IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR BORROWERS. TO NAVIGATE THAT ON THEIR OWN. AND THERE IS NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON STUDENT DIED ON FEDERAL STUDENT AT SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN COLLECT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN ISSUE A LOT OF THE BARS AND I WORK WITH A STRUGGLE WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PRIVATE STUDENT DEBT IN FACT AND FACE DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS. A SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW THE MORTGAGE CRISIS -- THESE DEBTS ARE ARE BAD THAT AND THEY ARE TRANSFERRED SEVERAL TIMES AND OFTEN LOCK PROPER DOCUMENTATION AND I UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE BORROWERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT REPRESENTED. AND SO CALIFORNIA COURTS ARE RUBBER STAMPING THOUSANDS OF DEFAULT JUDGMENTS AGAINST THESE BORROWERS. AND SO I THINK WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN A DIRE STUDENT DEBT CRISIS. OUTLAW FLOOD WE HAVE A STEADY STREAM OF BORROWERS ARE CONSTANTLY SEEKING ASSISTANCE AND ONE WAY THAT WE ARE HELPING BOWERS IS TO STOP INVOLUNTARY COLLECTION BY GETTING VIRUS OUT OF DEFAULT. AND INTO INCOME DIFFERENT PAYMENT PLANS WE ALSO ENGAGE IN STATE AND OUT NATIONAL FEDERAL POLICY ADVOCACY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CLIENT COMMUNITIES VOICES ARE BEING HEARD. AND WE OFFER TRAININGS TO OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS SO THAT THEY KNOW HOW TO HELP BORROWERS AS WELL. OUT WE HELP DEFEND AGAINST PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS AND A LARGE BULK OF MY PRACTICE IS HELPING BORROWERS WHO'VE BEEN DEFRAUDED. TO SEE CANCELLATION OF THEIR FEDERAL LOANS -- THROUGH THE VARIOUS -- ADMINISTRATIVE LOAN DISCHARGED OPTIONS AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS LAST YEAR WE SETTLED THE CASE THAT WE BROUGHT AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SECRETARY DEVICE -- FOR UNLAWFULLY DENYING OUR CLIENTS KNOWN DISCHARGE APPLICATION -- OUR CLIENT CHARLOTTE ATTENDED THE CAREER INSTITUTE -- WHICH IS A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE IN LONG BEACH -- BACK IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT I SAY ATTENDED BUT REALLY SHE VISITED THE SCHOOL WHEN SHE WAS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. I SHE HAD NOT GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL AT THE TIME AND DECIDED THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO ENROLL IN THE SCHOOL. NEVERTHELESS KRIEGER INSTITUTE RECEIVED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS FOR HER ENROLLMENT -- AND THEY COULD ONLY DO THAT BY FALSELY CERTIFYING THAT SHE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE LOANS -- WHICH BY FAILING TO PROVIDE HER WITH AN ABILITY TO BENEFIT TEST CONGRESS ENACTED ABILITY TO BENEFIT -- TESTS AS A SAFEGUARD SO THAT NOT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES COULD BE PROTECTED FROM THIS VERY KIND A FOR PROFIT COLLEGE FUND. ABOUT THE TIME CHARLOTTE APPLIED. ON AND FOUND OUT SHE WAS ELIGIBLE FOR LOAN RELIEF THROUGH THE FALL CERTIFICATION PROCESS HER LOANS HAD BALLOONED FROM MEETING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS FOR JUST CHARGE THE DEPARTMENT DENIED HER APPLICATION. AND SO SHE REACHED OUT TO OUR OFFICE FOR HELP. AND WE REPEAT PREPARED AN APPEAL CITING EVIDENCE THAT THE CAREER INSTITUTE WAS INVESTIGATED FOR FRAUD AND EMBEZZLEMENT FINANCIAL AID. MISCONDUCT AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT DENIED THE APPEAL SO WE RESPONDED BY FILING A FEDERAL COURT LAWSUIT. AND EVENTUALLY THE DEPARTMENT REVERSED ITS DECISION -- GRANTED CHARLOTTE'S LOAN THIS CHARGE AND REFUNDED HER EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE MOUNT THAT THEY HAD BEEN COLLECTING FROM HER FOR THE LAST THREE DECADES. THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY STORY FOR OUR CLIENTS BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF BORROWERS. UNREPRESENTED AND STILL STRUGGLING WITH THEIR STUDENT AT UNFORTUNATELY -- THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND VERY FEW ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO THIS KIND OF WORKING CALIFORNIA WITHOUT SOMEONE TO TURN FOR HELP BORROWERS ARE GOING TO TURN TO UNFORTUNATELY -- PREDATORY DEBT RELIEF SCHEMES WHICH LEGALLY CHARGE UP FRONT FEES -- FOR SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT BORROWERS CAN. TRIP TRUTHFULLY OBTAINED FOR FREE -- I'D LIKE TO JUST CLOSE WITH A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS. FIRST WE SHOULD ENACT STRONG MINIMUM STANDARDS TO STOP AND TO REDRESS FOR PROFIT SCHOOL FRAUD. AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO INCREASE FINANCIAL AID SO THAT WE CAN ASSIST LOW INCOME BORROWERS TO COMPLETE -- PROGRAMS THAT LEGITIMATE NONPROFIT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ON INCLUDING RCS USING COMMUNITY COLLEGES. NEXT WE NEED TO RESTORE ACCESS TO BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGE FOR ALL STUDENT LOANS CURRENTLY THE UNDUE HARDSHIP -- STANDARD APPLIES TO FEDERAL AND PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS AND UNTIL THIS HAPPENS WE NEED TO NXT PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE LOW INCOME BORROWERS ARE ABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR LIFE NECESSITIES IF THEY DO FACE -- A STUDENT LOAN JUDGMENT. WE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR LEGAL SERVICES TO HELP STRUGGLING BORROWERS AND FINALLY WE SHOULD INCREASE THE RELIEF AVAILABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA'S STUDENT LOAN TUITION RECOVERY FUND. FOR BORROWERS WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED BY FOR PROFIT COLLEGE FOUGHT. I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY FOR CREATING THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND FOR EVERYONE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE ON BEHALF OF LEGAL AID AND ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT COMMUNITIES. I THINK ONE THING THAT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IS THAT WE CERTAINLY NEED COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER PROTECTION HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE CREATED THAT FRAMEWORK. I'VE FOR MORTGAGES AND FROM FOR CREDIT CARDS IT SEEMS IT'S OUTRAGEOUS THAT WE DON'T HAVE ABOUT. FIVE YEAR FOR THE STUDENT LOAN INDUSTRY AND I THINK. I'M AS WE DISCUSS I DO THINK AB THREE SEVEN SIX IS A YOU KNOW. IMPORTANT IMPORTANT STEP AND IF THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT THAT WE CAN AND NEED TO DO. AND SIR THANK YOU AGAIN FOR BEING HERE AND FOR PROVIDING YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON THAT WAS. REALLY REALLY HELPFUL -- FOR ME. I'M WE'VE GOT AYE WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES NOW AND FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SO GONNA VIRGINITY IF THERE'S OTHER FOLKS IN THE ROOM THAT WANNA. SHARE THEIR STORIES OR OR SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVES -- WE LOVE TO WELCOME YOU TO DO THAT NOW. AND WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE DO THAT. HERE AT THE ODM. AND SO WE CAN GET AN INFORMAL LINE. HE SAID IT [INAUDIBLE] TEST. ASKING IF PEOPLE WANT IT I SPEAK IF YOU CAN KEEP IT TO TWO MINUTES THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I'M MORE WAITING TO SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO SPEAK I JUST I WANTED TO I'M ADDRESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT. I THAT SOMEBODY ASKED TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS DO MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN STUDENT THAT STORY. ALL OF US ARE HURT BY STUDENT AT EVEN POLICY LEADERS. AND SO THAT'S I'M. THAT REALLY IS GOING TO TRIGGERED AT IT AND IDEA FOR ME BUT FIRST I HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THIS WHEN I TALKED ABOUT SETTING UP THE THE STUDENT AT COMMITTEE. ON SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED THEIR STORIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GRAPPLING WITH. I'M ONE PERSON IT'S NOT NOT AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER BET ON SOMEONE'S SOMEONE'S PARTNER HAS. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY STAGGERING SO WHEN I WHEN I WAS SETTING UP THIS COMMITTEE. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL AND HOPING THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BUT THE QUESTION ITSELF REALLY PROMPTED ME I THINK A MINUTE ASK PEOPLE. TO DO THAT AND ASK PEOPLE TO KIND OF GET INVOLVED WITH THIS CONVERSATION AND USE THEIR STORY IN THEIR COMMUNITY TURN AGAIN TO RAISE THE PROFILE. OF THIS CONVERSATION AND TO MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT. IT'S NOT A YEAR THE SMALL GROUP AS A POLICY LEADERS ARE FOCUSED ON IN SACRAMENTO BUT THAT EVERYBODY IS THINKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF FOLKS IN THEIR COMMUNITY BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS GONNA REALLY ENABLE US TO TO ME THIS CONVERSATION. FORWARD TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION THANK YOU. FOR FIRST PARKING NOT IDEA. HI WELCOME THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND AND THE COMMITTEE -- FOR FOR BRINGING THIS TRUE -- ATTENTION AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY CONCERNING. MY NAME IS LAURIE OR TEASE. AND I'M A THIRTY FIVE YEAR -- PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEE -- I'M STILL EMPLOYED. I'M STILL ABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS I HAVE TO VETERANS SONS OF CONTRIBUTED TO MY COMMUNITY -- I AM HELPFUL TO THE COMMUNITY AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE DOWN THE NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS AND STUDENT AT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S PERHAPS A RUMOR. THAT I AM ELIGIBLE FOR STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS. YEARS AGO -- IF YOU MAKE. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS YOU COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FORGIVENESS I BELIEVE OF HALF THE LOAN. SINCE THEN IT HAS CHANGED -- BUT I HAVE TRIED AND REQUESTED MANY TIMES. TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ONLINE I HAVE PRACTICALLY BEGGED NOT BEYOND. AND VARIOUS COMPANIES TO PROVIDE ME WITH THIS INFORMATION. AND IT HAS RUINED MY CREDIT -- IT'S JUST. IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALLOWED I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SOME SUGGESTIONS OR QUESTIONS ASK QUESTIONS. SHOPS THERE CAN BE A STANDING OR AT LEAST AN AD HOC COMMITTEE. UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED -- TARGETING THOSE GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED REPAYMENT PLANS OR OR DISCARD FOR THE DISABLED ONE ONE COMMITTEE AND PERHAPS. ONE FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR FORGIVENESS PROGRAM UNTIL IT'S RESOLVED. AND I'D ALSO BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW A RECENT CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WENT. REGARDING THE PUBLIC SECTOR -- EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED INFORMATION. AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY DON'T QUALIFY THEY WERE GIVEN ALL KINDS OF EXCUSES BUT I DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND HOPEFUL THAT AS MOVE THAT THE FOLKS ARE JOINING US FOR THIS WORKSHOP MIGHT BE ABLE. TO I YOUR TO LOOK THROUGH YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION AND SEE IF THEY CAN HELP YOU. WITH THEM WITH THAT THANK YOU. HI MADAM CHAIR ARMENIANS CACHES SOME YOU SEE I STUDENT I JUST WANNA BE BRIEF TODAY -- AND SHARE SOME THOUGHTS FROM A LOT OF MEMBERS OF OUR STUDENT GOVERNMENT ON JUST IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE CONTEXT OF HOW WE GOT HERE. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S AN INSEPARABLE CONVERSATION TO TALK ABOUT DEBT AND THE COST OF EDUCATION ITSELF THE COST HAS BALLOONED ENORMOUSLY. ON I DID NOT KNOW THIS WHEN I BEGAN AT UCI BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A MASTER PLAN FOR EDUCATION THAT WE ADOPTED IN. NINETEEN SIXTY UNDER PAT BROWN AND I REALLY THINK THAT HELPED OUR STATE BECOME THE ECONOMIC SUPER POWER THAT IT IS TODAY. BUT WE ABANDONED THAT MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN. TWO THOUSAND AND SINCE THEN THE COST OF TUITION HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY FOR YOU SEE CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS -- RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA SPENDS LESS ON STUDENTS LIKE ME SAUL AND OTHERS THAN IT DOES ON THE AVERAGE THIRD GRADER. THAN THE AVERAGE THIRD GRADER ON YOUR KIDS. ON RIGHT NOW WE SPEND 610070% AS MUCH AS WE DO ON PRISONERS IN CALIFORNIA AS WE DO ON UC STUDENTS -- AND I WAS TROUBLING FOR ME TO LEARN BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL MY SOPHOMORE AND JUNIOR YEARS MY FATHER WAS IN PRISON. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPEND MORE INCARCERATING MEMBER OF MY FAMILY THAN THEY HAVE SPENT ON EDUCATION. FOR MY FAMILY. AND SO I DISAGREE SLIGHTLY WITH SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE FINANCIAL AID DIRECTOR THAT THESE ARE SELF HELP LOANS. BECAUSE IT DEBT IS A BURDEN STUDENT DEBT IS THE BURDEN IS A BURDEN FOR THAT TO BE PLACED ON SOMEBODY. SO I WOULD LOVE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YOU ALL TO THINK AMBITIOUSLY TO BE BOLD BECAUSE WE HAVE FAITH IN YOUR LEADERSHIP WE KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME IT'S BECOME A CRISIS. AND WE'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES AND I APPRECIATE YEAH I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP THAT. CASH AND AND SELL YOUR SHOWING. IN YOUR STUDENT COMMUNITY. THE TRUTH IS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS THE STUDENT AT CRISIS OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU SO MANY OTHER THAT BIG CHALLENGES CALIFORNIA'S FACING. NOBODY HAS ALL THE ANSWERS RIGHT AND WE'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THE ANSWERS ROLLING IN A FIND THE SOLUTIONS FOR ALL OUT AT THE TABLE AND AND WORKING TOGETHER AND SO. THAT'S YOU KNOW ONE THING I CAME AWAY REALLY DISMAYED FROM HEARING FROM SOME OF OUR PANELISTS YOU REALLY YOU KNOW. JUST HEARTBROKEN TEARS NAY STORIES BUT ALSO. I'M STILL BELIEVING THAT. WE'VE GOT ENOUGH THERE'S NOT SMART PEOPLE ENOUGH GOOD PEOPLE HERE IN CITY CALIFORNIA IN THE GOVERNMENT AND ALL SWEAR THAT WE CAN AND WILL SOLVE THIS IF WE WORK TOGETHER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS NATALIE LINES I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH A HOUSING AND ADDRESS AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN OAKLAND.

DOZENS OF CLIENTS -- OF JOSEPHINE WE TALKED ABOUT WE WORK WITH THESE PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE SEE THESE STORIES. MULTIPLY. IN OUR CONVERSATIONS AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- THAT I I KNOW LEGISLATORS FACE. DAY IN AND DAY OUT IS NOT HEARING AND NOT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY IMPACTED. AND YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT -- THERE'S SOME FEAR THERE'S LACK OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ELEVATED. IN THE PAST AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATORS UNDERSTAND THAT'S WHAT A SHAME. AROUND DEBTS A LOT OF SHAME AROUND COLLECTION AROUND DEFAULTS AROUND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A JOB BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PASS A CREDIT CHECK. AND SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF AFFIRMATIVE -- EMPOWERMENT ON ON BEHALF OF THESE PEOPLE. WHO REALLY COULD USE? OF THE ASSISTANCE THAT YOU ALL ARE. TRYING TO DEVELOP -- SAID THE DEGREE TO WHICH THOSE OF US WHO ARE REPRESENTING -- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IMPACTED CAN BRING THESE VOICES. TO LEGISLATORS LIKE YOURSELF WE WOULD LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU AND THAT IS SUCH A NICE SUCH AS A CUSHION AND POWERFUL. POINT AND AND WHILE TAKEN SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY. AND FOR YOUR ALL OF YOUR WORK IN THE SPACE.

ON THE FRONT END FIXING FINANCIAL AID COVERING THE TOTAL COST OF A COLLEGE AND ON THE BACK AND PROTECTING BORROWERS WITH THAT DEBT RIGHT NOW -- SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE WHOLE SPECTRUM HERE TODAY TO GET THAT -- OVERVIEW AND I JUST WANTED TO ALSO DEAL PLUG A MENTION OF THAT UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC LOANS LOANS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT WOMEN ESPECIALLY WERE CARRYING THE BIGGEST BURDEN OF DEBT -- IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS MANY OF COLORS AT RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED BY A BRAIN DRAIN.

I WE ORGAN ORGANIZATION WAS FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE PAY FOR EDUCATION IN OUR COUNTRY WE BOTH A SUPPORTER LIST OF ALMOST A MILLION STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS AND SUPPORTERS. AND WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN FACT WHEN WE SENT OUT A EMAIL ABOUT TODAY'S HEARING AND WORKSHOP. I RECEIVED THIS RESPONSE SO PLEASE APOLLO. MY APOLOGIES FOR READING FROM A CELL PHONE. I BET THIS CAME FROM LEN NAKAYAMA AND SHE SAID UNFORTUNATELY I WILL BE OUT OF TOWN BUT I CAN'T ATTEND -- AT THE AGE OF NEARLY SIXTY FOUR I AM FACED WITH A HUGE STUDENT LOAN BALANCE SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS. DUE TO THE FACT THAT I RETURN TO SCHOOL LATER THE MOST PEOPLE. MY STORY IS PROBABLY NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYONE ELSE I BECAME A SINGLE MOTHER WHEN MY SONS WERE UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR I HAD TO POSTPONE MY EDUCATION IS HOW THEY BOTH GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL. THERE WERE TWO JOBS ONE FULL TIME ONE PART TIME TO PUT SUPPORT MY FAMILY AND ANY FREE TIME WAS SPENT WITH MY CHILDREN. THE DECISION TO EARN A COLLEGE DEGREE WAS SO I COULD INCREASE MY SKILLS AND MARKETABILITY. THE SCHOOL I CHOSE WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT I COULD CONTINUE WORKING FULL TIME WHILE OBTAINING MY DEGREE. I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE THAT AT THE TIME THE COST WOULD BE SO HIGH. I HAD OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF WORK EXPERIENCE IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT BY BECAUSE I'M NOT AN EDUCATOR I DO NOT QUALIFY. THAT MERE NAME YOU MAY NOT BE TRUE WE WILL WORK WITH THEM -- FOR A LOAN FORGIVENESS OR REDUCTION THROUGHOUT THE YEARS OF MY LOANS WERE TRANSFERRED AND SOLD NOT MY CHOICE AND ENDED UP WITH. UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT MENTION THE SERVICER SHE'S ASKED ME TO KEEP THAT PRIVATE DUE TO FEAR OF RETRIBUTION. WELL I MADE PAYMENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS FINANCIAL SETBACKS DUE TO FAMILY CONCERNS PROVIDING ELDER CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND WORK FOR LOW'S DUE TO DISTRICT BUDGET CONCERNS. I ENDED UP IN A POSITION WHERE I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE PAYMENTS MY SERVICE ARE PLACED ME IN A DIFFERENT PROGRAM BUT WHILE IT HELPED IT ALSO INCREASED MY LOAN BALANCES. WELL I CONTINUE TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON MY LOAN I IT WOULD I NEVER WAS ABLE TO USE MY DEGREE TO IMPROVE MY WORK STATUS. I AM NOW FACED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO POSTPONE MY UPCOMING RETIREMENT DUE TO THE FACT THAT I MAY NAY NOT EVER EVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SAID THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHERILYN STORY WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF STORIES AND THAT'S JUST A SMALL SNIPPET OF THE THREE MILLION BORROWERS. PLUS HEARING CALIFORNIA AND THE FORTY FIVE MILLION BORROWERS NATIONWIDE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANKS FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HOSTING THIS TODAY IF YOU'RE THE TO SHIP ON THIS ISSUE. MY NAME'S CODY CANADIAN I'M THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR AT STUDENT DEBT CRISIS. AT THE TIME MENTIONED -- WHAT IS VERY IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION IS PUTTING? DIDN'T BORROWER STORIES FIRST AND I THINK YOU FOR HAVING SO MANY POWERFUL STORIES HERE TODAY -- I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU QUICKLY MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH MY EDUCATION SOON I'M COMPANY. FOR MY FAMILY THE COST OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. I'M I'M A TWIN BROTHER I HAVE A TWIN BROTHER WHO'S A POLICE OFFICER AND YOU KNOW. IMAGINE THE COST OF SENDING TWO CHILDREN TO COLLEGE AT THE SAME TIME. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT TO PAY FOR COLLEGE -- I NEEDED BOTH MY PARENTS AND MY GRANDPARENTS HELP -- MY GRANDPARENTS ARMENIAN REFUGEES WHO CAME TO AMERICA -- IN SEARCH OF THE STREAM AND EDUCATION WAS A CRUCIAL PART OF IT -- I CAN SAY NOW TODAY VERY PROUD THAT I'M A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA -- AND I CAN SAY PROBABLY THAT MY BROTHER IS ALSO A GRADUATE. CAL STATE SYSTEM AT LONG BEACH -- BUT WHAT HAS BEEN THE ONLY SEAT SOURCE OF RELIEF ON THE STERN DECK CRISIS MY FAMILY FOR MY GRANDPARENTS. RIVAS DEF AND FOR MY PARENTS IT WAS TOTAL AND PERMANENT DISABILITY TODAY I STAND HERE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT MYSELF. AND THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT -- I'M AN ADVOCATE ON THIS ISSUE AND EVEN I HAVE STRUGGLED TO MEET DEADLINES. I EVEN I'VE STRUGGLED TO COMMUNICATE PROPERLY WITH MY LOAN SERVICER. I MEAN EVEN I'VE RECEIVED WRONG INFORMATION FROM ISLAND SERVICING COMPANY -- BECAUSE OF THAT IT'S ACTUALLY COST ME THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IN -- CAPITALIZE INTEREST IN AN ADDITIONAL COST AND SO I REALLY URGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS -- PARTICULAR THE BAD ACTORS AND STUDENT LOAN SERVICING ISSUES THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED. AT THE STATE LEVEL. ALSO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME. TO THANK YOU YEAH AND HE FIRED AGAIN HIGHLIGHTING JUST HOW HARD THE LABYRINTH CAN BE TO NAVIGATE EVEN FOR SOMEONE AS YOU SAID HE'S WORKING IN THE SPACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS STEPHEN WEISS -- A PROGRESSIVE POLICY IN TURN -- WITH NEXT GEN -- I WANT TO REVISIT THE TUITION -- ISSUE -- IF YOU'RE AS MASOCHISTIC AS I AM AND YOU DO THE NUMBERS -- I CALCULATED THAT EVERY MINUTE OF CLASS TIME AT MY UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY -- COST ME TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS EVERY MINUTE -- NOT A SCHOOL KNOWN TO BE VERY AFFORDABLE AS WELL. SO I WANT TO REITERATE THAT STUDENT LOANS ARE NOT A CHOICE THERE ARE NECESSITY. WHEN TUITION IS IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR FOUR YEARS -- I ALSO REJECT THE NOTION THAT -- THESE BORROWERS WHO TAKE OUT LOANS ARE SOMEHOW YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE. I THINK THAT'S FRANKLY IT'S IT'S INSULTING AND I KNOW THAT DOES NOT COME FROM YOU CHAIR THAT IS -- HELPFUL IN THIS ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING -- I AM ABOUT TO GOING TO LAW SCHOOL I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE A FULL RIDE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW IN SACRAMENTO -- DECISION THAT WAS MADE BASED ON MY FINANCIAL SITUATION -- FRANKLY I DIDN'T TRUST THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- TO GIVE ME A A STUDENT LOAN AND AND NOT. THROW ME INTO THAT LATER ON SO. THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE A FULL RIDE BUT THAT ONLY COVERS TUITION IT DOES NOT COVER HOUSING TRANSPORTATION UTILITIES INTERNET TO COMPLETE MY ASSIGNMENTS FOOD EMERGENCY EXPENSES HEALTHCARE. YOU NAME IT. OR FOOD FOR MY TWO CATS FOR THAT MATTER. HOW I PLANNED -- MAKE UP THESE COSTS IS IN ADDITION TO BEING A FULL TIME LAW STUDENT I WILL HAVE -- TO USE MY GIRLFRIEND'S CAR TO DRIVE LIFT UBER. FOOD DELIVERY. ALL JOBS ANYTHING I CAN DO -- SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE WAY IN WHICH STUDENT BORROWERS ARE BEING TREATED IS A CRIME THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER WAY OF DESCRIBING IT ACCURATELY -- AND I KNOW THIS HASN'T REALLY BEEN BROUGHT UP BUT WE HEAR A LOT OF SCARY HEADLINES ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- THAT WILL FORCE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE BACK INTO SCHOOL SO THE CLOCK IS TICKING ON THIS ISSUE AND I JUST URGE YOU TO MOVE QUICKLY AND CONTINUE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THANK YOU. ALL THE SHORT PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THAT. HI MY NAME IS KRISTEN MCGUIRE I AM THE WESTERN REGION DIRECTOR FOR YOUNG INVINCIBLES WE ARE A NATIONAL POLICY AN ADVOCACY GROUP FOR YOUNG ADULTS -- I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY A LITTLE ABOUT MY OWN PERSONAL STORY BUT TELL YOU HOW IT'S REALLY NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM MANY OF THE YOUNG ADULTS THAT WE WORK WITH. I'M I'M A FIRST IN COLLEGE STUDENT -- I I AM A PRODUCT OF A SINGLE PARENT AND I HAVE TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS ONE ONLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS YOUNGER THAN ME -- AND HE USED TO TELL PEOPLE WE WERE TWINS SO I CAN KIND OF IDENTIFY WITH HAVING A TWIN BROTHER -- SO MY EFC WHEN I WENT TO COLLEGE WAS ZERO AS SO MY CAL STATE UNIVERSITY DEGREE. SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE -- HOWEVER I GRADUATED WITH TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT -- TO PAY FOR MY CAL STATE DEGREE -- THROUGH DEFAULT AND THROUGH INTEREST CHARGES -- I NOW -- IN REPAYMENT -- I PAY OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH -- AND I SAY THIS TO SAY -- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- HIGHER EDUCATION I SHOULD BE FINANCED IN A WAY WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO ASSUME THAT KIND OF DEBT JUST TO PAY TO LIVE TO PAY TO EAT -- TO PAY TO CARE FOR YOUR HEALTH CRISES THAT YOU MAY HAVE DURING THAT TIME. SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION -- I THINK IT'S PART OF A LARGER AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY CONVERSATION JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THAT EVERYONE IS ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN HIGHER EDUCATION AS A TOOL TO LIFT US OUT OF POVERTY.

TO FOLLOW SOME OF THE MORE COMPLICATED POTS AND THAT WOULD TAKE A MUCH LONGER EDUCATIONAL -- INVESTMENT AND THAT WOULD HAVE COST ME A GREAT DEAL ON STUDENT LOANS SO THAT'S WHY I PICKED THE DEGREE I CHOSE. A BEFORE I GOT TO YOU SEE I ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHO'S GONNA GET IN -- I HAVE GOTTEN IN AND I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD AFFORD IT AFTERWARDS I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE OF MY JUNIOR COLLEGE I WENT TO SENECA COLLEGE AND I EXPERIENCE I'VE HAD OF I WAS VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I HAD A A FINANCIAL AID PERSON. THERE WHO WAS REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WITH AND WE HAD THE BASICALLY HELP ME NAVIGATE A LOT OF ROUGH WATERS WITH FINANCIAL AID. AND I A WAS PREPARED BEFORE EVEN GETTING YOU SEE I THINKING -- OVER THE SUMMER I NEED TO WORK THREE DIFFERENT JOBS WHICH I DID. I HAD PEOPLE BASICALLY DONATE I DID GO FUND ME -- TO TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME MONEY SAVED UP BECAUSE I HAD A FEELING AND THIS WAS PROBABLY THIS IS WHAT AND EVENTUALLY BECAME THE CASE. THAT -- IS GONNA TAKE WHILE FOR FINANCIALLY TO ACTUALLY GET TO ME SO I DO NOT HOUSING THE FIRST WEEK OR SO OF SCHOOL BECAUSE THE ONLY HOUSING I COULD SECURE WAS AND THE OCTOBER WHICH AND SCHOOL STARTED LIKE THE WEEK BEFORE THAT. AND I WAS SO SCARED OF LIKE NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEND MY CLASSES AND HAVING BEEN VESTED IN SACRIFICE I GIVE UP MY APARTMENT IN INGLEWOOD -- LIKE THAT I ACTUALLY SLEPT BEHIND I OR WHAT USED TO BE THE SCIENCE LIBRARY -- OVER THERE FOR LIKE THE FIRST FIVE DAYS IN A TENT. I HAVE RECORDS OF ALL THIS. WITH THAT BEING THE CASE -- I WAS REVIEWING A LOT OF THE THE STATEMENTS ARE BY MADE AND I WAS I JUST FEEL LIKE PEOPLE HAVE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF JUST HOW -- EDUCATION PLAYS INTO OUR ECONOMY AS A US CITY STATE AND COUNTRY. AND THAT ARE CUT ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS BIASED AND NOT FUNCTIONING FOR MOST PEOPLE AND IN ORDER FOR US TO REMEDY THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH POWER IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW -- I THINK WE NEED TO TRYING TO CREATE AN INSTITUTION LIKE WHERE WE CAN LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES AND LIKE LAWSUIT ADDRESS THESE THINGS -- LIKE FINDING FUNDS BETWEEN. BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED ALSO ADDRESS THESE THINGS LIKE NEXT AND THEN -- THEN THE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS I THOUGHT HERE -- LAST THING IS LIKE I TRYING TO SUPPORT THINGS LIKE THE GREEN NEW DEAL WHICH WAS TRYING TO AIM AT LIKE A AND ECONOMIC PACKAGING OF HOW IT LIKE. IT'S ADDRESSING MULTIPLE PROBLEMS AT THE SAME TIME AND IS A PROMISED THAT THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO TRY AND SHIFT ITS FOCUS FROM BEING ABOUT -- WHAT WHATEVER IT'S DOING NOW THAT SEEMS TO BE GETTING AS THE SITUATION -- TO ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND AND CLIMATE CHANGE IN THESE KIND OF THINGS AND SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THESE BILLS AND LIKE LET US KNOW WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO HELP YOU. I LITERALLY WENT FROM FREE I TRY TO BE INVOLVED IN SOME KIND OF LOCAL POLITICAL STUFF SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT OFFER AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR -- THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS TOPIC THIS IS SUCH A COMPLEX DIFFICULT TOPIC -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROCESS MY SCHOOL DID NOT PROVIDE ANY RESOURCES. ANOTHER MY PARENTS WENT TO COLLEGE AND THEY WANTED TO HELP BUT THEY COULDN'T -- I JUST FIGURED OUT WITH REDDIT IN GOOGLE AND MYSELF. AND BEING FREE I'M HERE IN COLLEGE -- AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A LOAN BUT I TOOK OUT IN MY OWN NAME. BY MYSELF WITHOUT THE HELP OF ANY PARENTS OR TEACHERS. OR COUNSELORS OR ANYONE WITH HEALTH -- ONLY US IS THAT YOU PROVIDE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITH LIKE SOME EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND LOOK INTO PROVIDING. TOOL TO NAVIGATE THAT IN THE FUTURE SO THAT THEY CAN RELY ON SOMETHING. THAT'S IT. ABSOLUTELY YES WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB ON MANY DIMENSIONS BUT CERTAINLY.
