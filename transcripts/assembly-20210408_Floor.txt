THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS TO PRESENT ACR. FIFTY SIX. MEMBERS I PLEASE ASK YOU TAKE YOUR SEATS AND GIVE YOUR RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO MR GABRIEL MR GABRIEL PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER TODAY COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES IN ISRAEL AND AROUND THE WORLD OBSERVE YOM HASHOAH. HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. FOR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IT IS THE ANNUAL COMMEMORATION OF SIX MILLION JEWS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS MORE BRUTALLY MURDERED BY THE **** REGIME. PROJECTS CAUCUS IN A CAPITOL COMMUNITY TODAY MARKS THE FIRST TIME IN RECENT MEMORY THAT WE WILL OBSERVE YOM HA SHOAH WITHOUT HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS JOINING US HERE AT THE CAPITOL. FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE COUNTED ON THE SURVIVORS TO HELP US UNDERSTAND AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE EVENT. THEY WERE OUR HEROES AND OUR GUIDEPOSTS LIVING REMINDERS OF OUR SACRED DUTY NEVER TO REMAIN SILENT. WELL THERE ABSENCE TODAY IS DEEPLY FELT OUR OBLIGATION TO RECORD RECALL THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. IN TOO MANY PLACES AND ESPECIALLY FOR TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THE HOLOCAUST IS FADING FROM VIEW. AT THE SAME TIME ACTS OF ANTI SEMITISM AND OTHER FORMS OF HATRED AND BIGOTRY ARE RISING AT AN ALARMING RATE. FUELED BY CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND AMPLIFIED BY THE EXTRAORDINARY POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA. THE WORK BEFORE US IS PRESSING AN URGENT. IN AN EFFORT TO PERSONALIZE THAT WORK THE JEWISH CAUCUS HAS PROVIDED EACH OF YOU WITH A PRINTED TWEET FROM THE OFFICIAL AUSCHWITZ MEMORIAL TWITTER PAGE. WHICH HELPS TO PRESERVE THE MEMORY OF THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHO PERISHED IN THE DEATH CAMP AT AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU. EACH TWEET TELLS THE STORY OF A VICTIM OF THE HOLOCAUST WHO SHARES YOUR BIRTHDAY. A SMALL WINDOW INTO THE DEVASTATION FROM WHICH ENTIRE FAMILIES AND ENTIRE COMMUNITIES NEVER RECOVERED. IN MY CASE IT'S A TWEET ABOUT A YOUNG BOY NAMED ABLE BACK. ON HIS FOURTH BIRTHDAY ABLE WAS DEPORTED FROM FRANCE TO POLAND. TWO DAYS LATER HE WAS KILLED. WHEN I LOOK AT A BOTH PICTURE I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE MY SON JOSHUA WHO SHARES MY BIRTHDAY. AND ABLE. JOSH IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY SWEET AND HAPPY KID. A TRUE BLESSING FOR OUR FAMILY. AND IT'S JUST A FEW MONTHS HELP TURN FOR. WHICH MEANS HE'S GOING TO BE THE SAME AGE THAT ABLE ONCE WHEN HE WAS STRIPPED OF HIS COMMUNITY SHOVED INTO A CATTLE CAR AND PUSHED INTO A GAS CHAMBER. LIKE MANY OTHER JEWISH PARENTS I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF SOME DAY. SOMEBODY WILL TRY TO HER JOSH WILL BECAUSE WORKING WITH. YOU SEE FOR THE JEWISH COMMUNITY THE HOLOCAUST ISN'T A DISTANT MEMORY. THE NEW YORK OF JEWISH HISTORY TO RECENT EVENTS. A PARTICULARLY DEVASTATING CHAPTER IN A BOOK FILLED WITH PAINFUL STORIES OF PERSECUTION. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME THE HOLOCAUST EXEMPLIFIES THE ENDURING RESILIENCE OF OUR PEOPLE OF OUR SURVIVAL AGAINST ALL ODDS PUNCTUATED BY THE RETURN TO OUR HOMELAND AFTER TWO THOUSAND YEARS. OF FORCED EXILE. AND IT'S ALSO A CALL TO ACTION. THE ULTIMATE REMINDER OF HOW QUICKLY IN ADVANCED EDUCATED AND MODERN SOCIETY CAN UNRAVEL. OF HOW EASILY HATEFUL RHETORIC CAN TURN PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBORS AND LEAD TO UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE. OF OUR SACRED OBLIGATION TO SPEAK OUT WHENEVER AND WHEREVER BASELESS HATRED REARS ITS UGLY HEAD. FOR ME FOLLOWING THE AUSCHWITZ MEMORIAL ON TWITTER PROVIDES THE DAILY MOMENT OF REFLECTION. A REMINDER OF WHY DO THE WORK. AND OUR HOPE IS THAT SOME OF YOU IN THIS CHAMBER WILL DECIDE TO START FALLING MUSEUM ON TWITTER. AND THAT THE TWEETS PROVIDED TODAY WILL SERVE AS A REMINDER OF OUR COLLECTIVE OBLIGATION. TO ENSURE THAT NOTHING LIKE THE HOLOCAUST HAPPENS EVER AGAIN. TO ANY COMMUNITY OR IN ANY COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR HELPING US TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO PERISHED IN THE HOLOCAUST AND FOR STANDING WITH US AS WE WORK TO OVERCOME ANTI SEMITISM HATRED AND BIGOTRY OF ALL FORMS. I ASKED THAT THE FIRST WILL BE OPEN FOR CORPS AUTHORS AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL MISTER WARD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AT ALL TO BE G. Q. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT AND ACR FIFTY SIX. TODAY WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES DURING THE HOLOCAUST IN HONOR OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THIS HEINOUS ATTEMPT AT EXTERMINATION. MANY GROUPS ARE TARGETED AND PERSECUTED IN THE HOLOCAUST ALONGSIDE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY INCLUDING AND ESPECIALLY THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. HITLER AND THE **** PARTY TARGETED DEMAND BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE QUOTE. UNFIT TO DEFEND THE NATION IN COMBAT AND WOULD DIMINISH THE GERMAN REPRODUCTIVE PTENTIAL. IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS LGBTQ INMATES WERE KEPT IN SEPARATE FACILITIES FOR THE FEAR THAT HOMOSEXUALITY WOULD SPREAD IT TO OTHER PRISONERS. RUDOLPH RAZA WAS ONCE A SURVIVOR HE WAS INTERNED IN BOOK INVOLVED AS TRIANGLE NUMBER SEVEN NINE FIVE TWO UNTIL IS LIBERATION BY U. S. FORCES IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE. BEFORE HIS PASSING IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN MISTER BRONSON WAS THE LAST KNOWN CONCENTRATION CAMP SURVIVOR TO WEAR THE PINK TRIANGLE. AND THE EMBLEM HOMOSEXUALS HAD TO WEAR THE L. G. B. T. Q. EQUIVALENT. OF THE YELLOW JEWISH STAR. WILL HE BE IT A POINT TO SHARE STORY OF THE L. B. T. VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. THIS STORY IS OFTEN OMITTED FROM HOLOCAUST LITERATURE AND EDUCATION. IT WAS NOT UNTIL TWO THOUSAND TWO THAT GERMANY ACKNOWLEDGE AND APOLOGIZE FOR THE HORRORS PERPETRATED BY THE COMMUNITY. WE NEED TO SPREAD AWARENESS OF RUDOLPH'S STORY AND THE STORY OF ALL THOSE PERSECUTED IN THE HOLOCAUST. AND AS WE SHARE THE STORIES WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT HE IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE AND PRESENT WITH US TODAY. LET'S CONTINUE TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND COLLECTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST ANYONE WHO CLAIMS THEIR IDENTITY IS SUPREME. AND FIGHT FOR A FREE. EQUITABLE AND SAFE SOCIETY FOR ALL. YOU'RE EITHER ON THE C. R. FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER WARD MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR FIFTY SIX AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM WOODLAND HILLS FOR BRINGING THAT MEASURE. BEFORE US TODAY. THE HOLOCAUST WILL FOREVER BE A STARK REMINDER THAT WE MUST ALWAYS LOOK TO OUR PAST. IN ORDER TO INFORM OUR PRESENT. AND THE FUTURE. WE MUST REFLECT UPON OUR HISTORY PARTICULARLY ITS DARKEST MOMENTS IN ORDER TO LEARN FROM THE TRAGEDIES. THAT HAVE BEFALLEN HUMANKIND AND ENSURE THAT SIMILAR EVENTS. NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN AND- YOU KNOW- OF FOR EACH OF THE MEMBERS- AT LEAST OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL COMMEMORATION BECAUSE EACH OF US. NO PEOPLE. FROM OUR FAMILIES WHO WERE LOST IN THE HOLOCAUST OR WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE HOLOCAUST- WHO SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. I'M WE STAND HERE TODAY AT A TIME WHEN FEWER AND FEWER INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THE HOLOCAUST TO REMAIN WITH US THIS IS THE MARCH OF TIME IT'S A FACT THAT WE LIVE WITH IN FACT WE HONORED MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THIS VERY FLOOR OVER THE YEARS AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO YOU MET AND SHOOK THE HANDS OF- AND THANKS FOR BEING HERE ARE GONE THEY'RE NOT WITH US ANY LONGER. I HAD THE OCCASION JUST COINCIDENTLY A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO I FLIPPED ON THE TV AND I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO WATCH AND I- I FOUND THAT THE THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT STEVEN SPIELBERG WHO HUNT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO YOU BUT- HI HE RECEIVED AN ACADEMY AWARD. FOR THE FILM SCHINDLER'S LIST- THEN I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY. OF A NON JEW WHO SAVED OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE- DURING THE HOLOCAUST. AND ONE OF THE VIGNETTE STARTS IN THIS DOCUMENTARY IS THE APPLE LOG TO THAT FILM WHERE. AFTER SEEING THIS TRAGEDY UNFOLD IN THIS VERY RIGHTEOUS INDIVIDUAL SAVE SO MANY LIVES- AT THE SCENE SHIFTS FROM **** GERMANY TO PRESENT DAY ISRAEL AND DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SURVIVED AND WHO WERE SAVED BY OSKAR SCHINDLER COME TO THE GRAVE. OF SCHINDLER AND PLACE AS IS THE JEWISH TRADITION- A MARKER A STONE ON. THE MARKER- ON A SYMBOL OF THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE SOMEBODY HAS COME TO VISIT YOU. STONE AFTER STONE AFTER STONE IS PLACED ON THAT MARKER. AND I WOULD IMPLORE EACH OF YOU TO THINK OF THAT STE OF THOSE STONES AS SYMBOLS- WE EACH NEED TO PLACE STONES. TO REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST AND WE SHOULD BUILD. COLLECTIVELY A MOUNTAIN NOT A MOUNTAIN A MOUNTAIN RANGE OF STONES. TALLER AND WIDER THAN THE MIGHTY SIERRA NEVADA THAT SHOULD BE OUR LONG LASTING MEMORIAL SO THAT WE NEVER FORGET THE LESSONS OF THE HOLOCAUST. THANK YOU I STAND IN SUPPORT OF ACR FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF OUR CANYON RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I RISE TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO ON THIS FLOOR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY AYE ROSEN AYE DURING THE MEMORY OF MY GRANDMOTHER WHO JUST PASSED AWAY AT NINETY EIGHT YEAR ALMOST NINETY EIGHT YEARS OLD AFTER SURVIVING THE HOLOCAUST. BUT TODAY I WANT TO REMEMBER SOMEONE DIFFERENT MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER- MAP BERMAN WAS TINY SMALLER THAN ME WHICH IS ALL OF YOU KNOW IT'S SAYING A LOT. AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST LOVING PEOPLE I EVER KNEW SHE ALWAYS HAD A NEW BEADED NECKLACE FOR ME EVERY TIME SHE SAW ME BECAUSE SHE KNEW I LOVED IT. AND I'M STANDING HERE TODAY BECAUSE ON NOVEMBER NINTH NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. IRMA BOUGHT TICKETS TO THE OPERA. THAT'S IT FINE FEELING HERE THE NEW KRISTALLNACHT WAS COMING THE NEW THEY'RE GONNA BE ROUNDED UP IN VIENNA AND SO SHE TAUGHT BY TICKETS TO BE AN OFFER AND THEY WENT THAT EVENING DRESSED UP AND THEY WENT TO THE OPERA. AND SO THEY WERE ROUNDED UP. AND THEY FOUND A WAY OUT A FEW MONTHS LATER. BUT I SHOULDN'T JUST BE STANDING HERE BECAUSE MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER BUY TICKETS TO THE OPERA. I SHOULD BE STANDING HERE BECAUSE MY FAMILY HAD MEANS TO FIND A WAY OUT. THE NEW SOMEONE OCEANS AWAY THAT WOULD SPONSOR OUR FAMILY. AND MUCH IS MADE OF SCHINDLER AND THE OTHERS WHO DID SO MUCH WITH SUCH BRAVERY. TO SAVE LIVES DURING THE HOLOCAUST BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THE PEOPLE. WHO LIVES OUTSIDE THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS WHO WOULD BE SHOWERED IN THE ASH OF THOSE THAT WERE BEING BURNED IN THE EVENTS IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS THEY DID NOTHING. AND WE HAVE A CHOICE EVERY TIME HEAT RISES UP. TO BE THE OSKAR SCHINDLER'S. OR TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO SWING ON SWINGS THAT'S COVERED IN ASH OF THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO ARE BEING BURNED. AND WE HAVE STEPPED UP MEMBERS TO BE LEADERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR STATE AND OUR NATION. AND WE MUST REMEMBER OUR SOLEMN OBLIGATION THE OBLIGATION THAT ARE CALLING FROM SANTA MONICA JUST SPOKE ABOUT. TO STAND UP TO HATE IN ALL OF ITS FORMS. BECAUSE THE HOLOCAUST DIDN'T START WITH PEOPLE BEING BURNED IN OVENS. THAT WAS ITS CULMINATION. IT STARTED WITH PROPAGANDA IN HEATS. AND MY GRANDMOTHER BEING KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS NO LONGER WORTHY TO BE EDUCATED. AND THEN IT ENDED IN THE LIVES LOST THAT WE SPEAK ABOUT TODAY YOU SEE SITTING ON YOUR DESKS. AND SO WE MUST STAND UP AT THAT FIRST MOMENT WHEN WE HEAR PROPAGANDA TO SAY NO WE KNOW WHERE THIS CAN LEAD. AND IT JUST RECENT YEARS WE SON **** MARCHING IN THE STREETS OF AMERICA. MY GRANDMOTHER WAS ALIVE TO SEE THAT. WE MUST BE OF THE FORCE THAT STOPS THAT. AND SO WE SPOKE RECENTLY ABOUT THE ANTI ASIAN HATE THAT IS ON A RISE WE TALK ABOUT THE ANTI SEMITISM THE CONTINUES TO RISE AND I AM FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO USE TODAY TO REMEMBER OUR OBLIGATION TO STOP IT TO SPEAK OUT AND TO NEVER BE SILENT SO THIS. NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. SO ONE'S LIFE DOESN'T COME DOWN TO WHETHER THEY BUY TICKETS TO THE OPERA. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON ACR FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER CAN. SOME AMERICANS AARON YOU'RE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF P. C. R. FIFTY SIX FOR HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL AND THE LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN RECOGNIZING. THIS DAY AS WE ALL REMEMBER AND PAY OUR RESPECTS TO THE MILLIONS OF-INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO LOST THEIR LIVES UNDER THE **** REGIME. WE MUST NOT FORGET THE HORRORS THESE VICTIMS FACED MORE THAN SEVENTY YEARS AGO AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WE MUST NOT FORGET THE FACTORS. THAT LED TO THIS ATROCITY AS ELOQUENTLY STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE. JUST PREVIOUSLY SPEAKING. WHEN THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE WAS FIRST MET WITH SILENCE ADOLF HITLER IN PERSUADING HIS ARMY COMMANDERS THAT THE MERCILESS PERSECUTION OF KILLINGS OF JEWS AND OTHERS WOULD BRING NO RETRIBUTION DECLARED WHO AFTER ALL. REMEMBERS THE ARMENIANS TODAY. LESS THAN FOUR DECADES AFTER THE HOLOCAUST ANOTHER GENOCIDE OCCURRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. A REGIME LED BY POL POT EXECUTED NEARLY A QUARTER OF CAMBODIA'S. AS WE REFLECT ON THESE FRIGHTENING TIMES WE MUST REMEMBER TO STAND WITH ONE ANOTHER AND SPEAK OUT TO ENSURE THAT THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE ON INDIVIDUALS OVER THEIR BACKGROUNDS THEIR CULTURES WHERE THEIR RELIGIONS WILL NEVER OCCUR AGAIN. WE OWE IT TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS TO REMEMBER OUR PAST AND LEARN IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD WITH RESPECT AND COMPASSION FOR ALL PEOPLE. I STRONGLY URGE AND I VOTE FOR ACR FIFTY SIX AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK. MR LEVINE AND MR GABRIEL AND THE ENTIRE JEWISH CAUCUS FOR PROVIDING US WITH THESE. FRAMED PHOTOS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SHARE ALL OF OUR RESPECTIVE BIRTHDATES- I MAY NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BOLESLAW. JEFF AND WEBER EXCEPT THAT HE WAS AN ELECTRICIAN AND THAT HIS FATE IS UNKNOWN AS OF OCTOBER TWENTIETH NINETEEN FORTY TWO. AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF HE DOES HAVE ANY SURVIVORS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT NEVER BEING ABLE TO RECOVER. WHERE HIS BODY LAY AND HOW HIS LAST MINUTES WERE. AND IT'S WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. THAT FATE OF INDIVIDUALS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEVER REPEATS ITSELF AGAIN THANK YOU. PARAPHYLETIC STILL INDUSTRY VERY SPEECH THANK YOU MISTER. THROUGH THE RECOGNIZE NEAR THE CHAMBER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR FIFTY SIX WHICH PROCLAIMS APRIL EIGHTH AS HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY AND URGES REMEMBRANCE OF THE VICTIMS WERE MURDERED NEARLY EIGHTY YEARS AGO. THE INDESCRIBABLE OF EVENTS WHICH TRANSPIRED ROOTED IN FEELINGS OF FEAR AND HATE FEELINGS THEY CONTINUE TO PROCESS AS WE STRUGGLE WITH THE ONGOING CRIMES OF PERSECUTION AND DISCRIMINATION. AGAINST MINORITIES AND MANY COMMUNITIES. TODAY WE MUST STAY VIGILANT AGAINST THE DEHUMANISATION AND PERSECUTION OF THOSE WHO ONLY CRIME IS TO BE DIFFERENT. IT IS THEREFORE OUR ROLE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO UPHOLD THE RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE. AS WE DO WE MUST ACTIVELY REMEMBER THE STORIES OF THE VICTIMS AND THE SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST SOME CELEBRATING THEIR LIVES AND MOURNING THE PAIN. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LURED AND CONTINUES TO INDOOR. AND% I'D LIKE TO END WITH JUST A SHORT- STORY ANTIDOTE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. I WAS AWARDED A FELLOWSHIP. FROM THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES THE OAS. TO TRAVEL TO PANAMA TO THE JEWS OF PANAMA. AND AS I WAS LOOKING THROUGH- THE ARCHIVES I CAME ACROSS LETTERS LETTERS FROM WORLD WAR TWO WRITTEN BY PANAMANIAN JEWS. WHO SENT MONEY AND LETTERS. IN SUPPORT OF THE RELIEF EFFORTS OF THE JEWS OF EASTERN EUROPE. SO I AM PROUD TO STAND HERE IN REMEMBRANCE AND SUPPORT ACR FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR NINETEEN AND ASSUMING YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND DIE RISE TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN SUPPORT OF ACR FIFTY SIX- TO REMEMBER THE HOLOCAUST ALL OF THE VICTIMS I'M A I'M I'M AMAZED TO STAND WITH YOU- NINE YEARS SEN. TO BEING WITH MANY OF YOU HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THAT WE'VE MARKED HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY TOGETHER AND THAT WE'VE- EVOLVED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC TO DO THIS IN- WHAT I BELIEVE IS JUST AN EXTRAORDINARILY POWERFUL AND MEANINGFUL WAY TO CONNECT EACH OF US. TO A PERSON WHO WAS MURDERED BY THE **** IT'S EASY TO THINK ABOUT. THE SIX MILLION JEWS THE ELEVEN MILLION MURDERED. INNOCENT PEOPLE. THAT WE CAN BE OVERWHELMED BY THOSE NUMBERS. AND TO LEARN. THE IDENTITIES. TO SEE INTO. THE INNOCENT SMILES THE JOYFUL FACES OR THE EYES THAT ARE IN HORROR. IN SOME OF THE SHOTS OF PRISONERS WHETHER IT BE A POLISH OLYMPIAN. TODDLERS STANDING TOGETHER OR- IN MY CASE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY WHOSE NAME DESERVES TO BE READ JESUS DYING GEISER A HUNG FROM HUNGRY HE WAS BORN ON MY DESK ON MY BIRTHDAY IN NINETEEN THIRTY AND WAS MURDERED AFTER IS FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR IN THE GAS CHAMBER AT AUSCHWITZ AND- AND LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM WOODLAND HILLS I CAN'T STOP BUT THINK ABOUT MY OWN FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON. WHO CELEBRATED HIS BAR MITZVAH LAST YEAR AND WHAT THAT WAS LIKE IN AND I WAS I WAS THUMBING THROUGH THIS BOOK. AND I IN PLEASE PLEASE DO. JUST READ A FEW OF THE STORIES AND LOOK INTO THE EYES. OF SOME OF THE VICTIMS. THAT THAT- THAT YOU LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH PERSON'S HUMANITY AND THERE'S JUST THERE'S VERY LITTLE ABOUT THIS BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY. HE WAS A CHECK BOY. BORN ON THE FOURTH OF SEPTEMBER NINETEEN THIRTY. IN FRONT OF BASS. AND PERMISSION READ MASSACRE WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU AND HE WAS DEPORTED TO REASONS DOT. GHETTO IN DECEMBER OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND HE WROTE A POEM. WHILE HE WAS THERE IN THAT GHETTO. HE WAS MURDERED. IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR BUT BEFORE HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO AUSCHWITZ. HE WROTE THIS POEM AT TREASON STAT AND HE TITLED AT THE GARDEN. THE GARDEN. A LITTLE GARDEN FRAGRANT AND FULL OF ROSES. THE PATH IS NARROW. AND A LITTLE BOY WALKS ALONG IT. A LITTLE BOY. A SWEET BOY. LIKE THAT GROWING BLOSSOM. WHEN THE BLOSSOM COMES TO BLOOM. THE LITTLE BOY WILL BE NO MORE. HE KNEW. BEFORE HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO AUSCHWITZ WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM. AND SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD YOU KNOW. I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR HELPING US REMEMBER HIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR LEVINE MISTER JOHN SORRY RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS TO EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST SUPPORT. I STRONGLY SUPPORT FOR ACR FIFTY SIX RECOGNIZING TODAY AS CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL DAY. ON THIS DAY WE MUST ALL TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER THE VICTIMS OF THE ANTI SEMITIC GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE SUPPORT FOR OUR JEWISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO CONTINUE TO EXPAND EXPERIENCED PREJUDICE TODAY. PEOPLE OFTEN WISH THAT WE COULD SIMPLY BE RACE. THE DARK STAINS FROM OUR HISTORY. BUT WE DON'T BUT IF WE DON'T REMEMBER THE ATROCITIES OF THE PAST IF WE DON'T CONFRONT HATRED. WE ARE AT RISK OF ALLOWING THOSE MISTAKES TO HAPPEN AGAIN. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY. THE HOLOCAUST NEVER HAPPENED FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER THESE ARE SOME. PLEASE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT CLAIM BUT THE LARGEST GENOCIDE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MODERN WORLD NEVER HAPPENED. THEY THINK IT WAS A HOAX. THAT IS A VERY VERY SICKENING THOUGHT. BLACK PEOPLE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE COST OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN A TRUSTED IS COMMITTED DURING THE HOLOCAUST MINORITIES ACROSS THE GLOBE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE WORST THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER IN THE NAME OF PROTECTING A MASTER RACE YET WE CONTINUE TO SEE VIOLENCE PERPETRATED AGAINST MINORITIES DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. AN ESTIMATED SIXTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WERE SYSTEMATICALLY MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD IN THE NAME OF WHITE SUPREMACY AND TODAY WE REMEMBER THEM. BECAUSE WHEN WE IGNORE HISTORY. WE ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT. I'LL BE HAPPY TO CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FOR. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WEEK SUPPORT ACR FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. YES FRIEDMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR FIFTY SIX. OF THE MILLIONS THAT PERISHED DURING THE HOLOCAUST WOMEN WERE SUBJECTED TO SOME OF THE MOST INHUMANE TREATMENT. MOTHERS WERE SEPARATED FROM THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES SOMETIMES BEING FORCED TO CHOOSE WHICH ONE CHILD THEY WOULD BRING WITH THEM IN A MIRAGE OF THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THAT CHILD WHICH DID NOT HAPPEN. PREGNANT WOMEN WERE FORCED INTO THE GAS CHAMBERS FIRST SINCE THEY WERE DEEMED INCAPABLE OF WORK AND JUST TO REMIND PEOPLE WHEN THE JEWS GOT OFF THE GAS CHAMBERS A FEW OF THEM WERE SELECTED TO WORK. THE REST WERE SENT DIRECTLY TO REMOVE THEIR CLOTHING AND MARCH DIRECTLY INTO THE GAS CHAMBER SO THIS WAS A VERY FAST ASSEMBLY LIKE DE HUMANIZE PROCESS. JEWISH AND GYPSY WOMEN WERE RAPED AND TORTURED BY THE **** THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO HORRIFIC EXPERIMENTS THAT LEFT THEM SCARRED AND STERILE. PART OF REMEMBERING THE HOLOCAUST IS ALSO REMEMBERING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PERISHED WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE THE COMMEMORATIVE- PLATES ON YOUR- DESK TODAY WITH SOME OF THE VICTIMS I WANT TO CALL OUT A FEW MORE. THESE WERE WOMEN LIKE CAROLINE FLIES NERVE WHO ARRIVED AT AUSCHWITZ ON AUGUST SECOND NINETEEN FORTY THREE AND A TRANSPORT OF ONE THOUSAND JEWS SHE DID NOT SURVIVE. THEY WERE YOUNG GIRLS LIKE ON A FLASHOVER WAS DEPORTED TO AUSCHWITZ AT THE AGE OF FIVE WITH HER BROTHER JOHN WHO WAS SEVEN. THEY WERE BOTH MURDERED IN THE GAS CHAMBERS. WOMEN ALSO PLAYED KEY ROLES AS HEROES SAVING VICTIMS AND LIBERATING PRISONERS FIGHTING IN THE RESISTANCE AND FINALLY HOLDING ALL THOSE WHO COMMITTED THESE TERRIBLE CRIMES ACCOUNTABLE THEY WERE HER ROPE WOMEN LIKE HEY COULD GROSSMAN ONE OF THE ORGANIZERS OF THE BLS DOC UNDERGROUND THE OTHER STOCK BY THE WAY IS WHERE MY GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY IS FROM. BRAVE WOMEN LIKE ALLAH GERBNER REGINA SAPPERS AND ESTHER WEST PALM AND ROSA ROPE TO WHO SUPPLIED THE GUN POWDER. THAT MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH SONQOR COMMANDO AT AUSCHWITZ USED TO BLOW UP A GAS CHAMBER AND KILL SEVERAL ASSESSMENT DURING THE UPRISING. IN OCTOBER OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR. AND THERE IS A FICTION BY THE WAY THAT JEWS AND OTHER VICTIMS MARCHED LIKE SHEEP INTO THE GAS CHAMBERS AND THIS WAS NOT TRUE THERE WERE MANY UPRISINGS THROUGHOUT THE HOLOCAUST. THERE WERE MANY RESISTANCE FIGHTERS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE SIMPLY. NOT JUST OUTLINED BUT THEY HAD AN ENTIRE NATION THAT WAS CMPLICIT. AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATING WITH THE **** AGAINST THEM AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO ALWAYS REMEMBER. THEY WERE THE DAUGHTERS OF LIBERATORS AND RESISTANCE FIGHTERS LIKE MY DEAR FRIEND KRISTA MILLER WHO LOST HER PARENTS AND EMERGE FROM WORLD WAR TWO WITHOUT HER FAMILY AND WITHOUT A HOME. CHRISTA'S FATHER WAS PART OF THE GERMAN RESISTANCE AGAINST HITLER IN PARIS AND THE FAILED PLOT TO ASSASSINATE HITLER IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR. HE WAS EXECUTED ALONG WITH HER MOTHER. AND HER FAMILY WAS FORCED INTO CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND HELL'S WORTH OTHER TRADER CHILDREN OF REBELLIOUS SS OFFICERS. TODAY WE PAY TRIBUTE TO ALL THE WOMEN AND THEIR ROLE IN ONE OF THE DARKEST CHAPTERS IN OUR HISTORY. WE HONOR THEIR SACRIFICE INDOMITABLE STRENGTH AND SPIRIT. WE REMEMBER OF THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF BRAVERY PERSEVERANCE AND LEADERSHIP. AND YOU KNOW ON THIS DAY EVERY YEAR WE SAY NEVER AGAIN. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE HEAD WE HAVE HAD SEVEN RECOGNIZE WORLDWIDE RECOGNIZED GENOCIDE SINCE THE HOLOCAUST. AND THIRTY SEVEN INCIDENTS WHICH MANY ARGUE COULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF GENOCIDE. SO WE NEED TO ALWAYS BE ACTIVE AND DELIBERATE. AND AS HAS BEEN PORTED OUT GENOCIDES DON'T ALWAYS START WITH PEOPLE SHOOTING THEY DON'T START WITH BEING PEOPLE BEING PUSHED INTO THE GAS CHAMBERS. THEY START WITH A CASUAL ACCEPTANCE OF HATRED. OF RACISM AND ANTISEMITISM ALLOWING THOSE TROOPS TO GO ON ANSWERED. WE NEED TO SPEAK OUT WE NEED TO PROMISE THAT WE WILL SPEAK OUT WHEN WE SEE THOSE ENORMOUS WHEN WE SEE JEWISH CANDIDATES. HAVE FLYERS AGAINST THEM WHERE THEY ARE JEWISH FEATURES THEIR NOSES ARE ELONGATED ONE DOLLAR BILLS ARE PLASTERED OVER THEIR FACES WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN MY TIME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE NEED TO SPEAK OUT WHEN WE HEAR JEWS ON THE WORLDWIDE STAGE UNIQUELY CALLED OUT AND YOU LEGALLY HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. THAN OTHER NATIONALITIES WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JEWS CONTROLLING THE MEDIA OR CONTROLLING THE BANKS OR BEING GREEDY OR BEING RICH THAT THESE ARE THE SAME ANTI SEMITIC TROPES THAT PEOPLE USED TO JUSTIFY THE EXTERMINATION. OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT IT REALLY MEANS TO NEVER FORGET. WITH THAT I URGE A VOTE ON A NAY VOTE ON A CA FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER MR GABRIEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I FIRST WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES AND ALL THE OTHER CAUCUSES IN PARTICULAR FOR THEIR- VERY POWERFUL AND ELOQUENT WORDS AND I. HAVE TO SAY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL MEANS SO MUCH TO ME AND SO MUCH TO OUR JEWISH CAUCUS FOR. THE OTHER CAUCUSES AND FOR COLLEAGUES FROM ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND PARTS OF THE STATE TO STAND WITH US AND WHY WE FEEL SO COMMITTED TO STAND WITH THE API CAUCUSES THEY'RE GOING THROUGH. THIS EXTRAORDINARY SURGE IN AB I HATE ALL OF THE OTHER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE INDOOR TRAUMA. SO THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR OUR SURVIVORS ARE LEAVING US IN SO MANY FOLKS WHO HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE HOLOCAUST ARE. OUR DEPARTED AND I WAS REMINDED I KEPT THINKING THIS WEEK OF A STORY. THAT WAS TOLD TO ME BY A VERY PROMINENT JEWISH COMMUNITY LEADER BY THE NAME OF LERI WEINBERG FROM LOS ANGELES SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL. OUR CALLING FROM SANTA MONICA AND I TURNED THIS BODY IN HIS MEMORY. A FEW MONTHS AGO HE WAS OF A SELF MADE PROMINENT. BUSINESS EXECUTIVE VERY INVOLVED AS A POLITICAL ACTIVIST MOST WELL KNOWN FOR OWNING THE PORTLAND TRAILBLAZERS AND SERVING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NBA. I HAD THE CHANCE ON A FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEND TIME WITH LARRY. AND ON ONE OF THOSE ASKED HIM A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW HE BECAME SO INVOLVED IN POLITICS. HE TOLD ME A STORY ABOUT HOW BEFORE. HE HE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A POOR IMMIGRANT JEWISH FAMILY LIVING IN BROOKLYN.

BAYONETED BY GERMAN SOLDIER HE SUFFERED ANTI SEMITISM FROM AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN HIS OWN RANKS. BUT AT THE END OF THE WAR YET A PARTICULARLY MOVING EXPERIENCE. HE WAS A- HIS UNIT WAS WITH MOVING THROUGH. THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE IN EUROPE. AND THEY THEY ENCOUNTERED SOMEONE WHO CAME OUT OF THE WOODS AND HE WAS EMACIATED AND- I'M DRESSED AND DRESSED IN RAGS AS LARRY TELLS WITH AND- YOUR DIRTY FILTHY AND HUNGRY.

A PROUD NEED OF THE SAN DIEGO SENATOR MILLS NEVER MINISTRY CAR HE WOULD NOT RIDE OR HISTORIC BUILDING THAT HE WOULD NOT SAVE. JIM MILLS WAS TRULY AN UNUSUAL POLITICIAN. READ MORE VETERAN A MIDDLE SCHOOL HISTORY TEACHER AND AN INTELLECTUAL WHO WROTE A HALF A DOZEN BOOKS OFTEN ABOUT RELIGIOUS HISTORY. IN HIS TWENTY TWO YEAR CAREER IN THE LEGISLATURE HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN ISSUES SUCH AS PASSION FOR MASS TRANSIT MANY WAS IN POLITICAL GAMESMANSHIP. DESPITE BEING VERY LIBERAL FIRST TIME SENATOR MILLS CONDUCTED HIMSELF AS A TEMPERAMENTAL MODERATE MASTERING THE SKILL OF HAVING ACTED DISAGREEMENTS WITHOUT BEING ACTIVELY DISAGREEABLE. THIS ABILITY TO WORK EFFECTIVELY ACROSS THE AISLE GOT HIM APPOINTED PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE ADVISE COLLEAGUES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE A POSITION THAT HE HELD UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY. DURING HIS TIME AS A LEGISLATOR SENATOR MILLS AUTHORED BILLS THAT CREATED THE SAN DIEGO TROLLEY. AND OLD TOWN STATE PARK AS WELL AS AUTHORED THE MILLS ACT WHICH IS CREDITED FOR SAVING THOUSANDS OF HISTORIC RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS FROM DESTRUCTION ACROSS OUR STATE. IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS PASSION FOR HIS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS. SENATOR MILLS WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN TO THE AMTRAK BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHERE HE SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. JIM MILLS CONTINUED TO BE A PUBLIC SERVANT AFTER ELECTED ALL AFTER HE LEFT ELECTED OFFICE SERVING AS THE CHAIR OF OUR METROPOLITAN TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN SAN DIEGO FOR NINE YEARS. ITS HEADQUARTERS WAS NAMED IN HIS HONOR- OF SERVICE. SENATOR MILLS. WAS A GIANT AND LOCAL AND STATE POLITICS IS. HAS CEMENTED HIS PLACE IN HISTORY OF HOW. AND SAN DIEGO.

THANK YOU MISTER WORDS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE FISHERMEN IN MEMORY. THANK YOU I ALSO ADJOURNED MEMORY OF FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER AND SENATOR JIM MILLS- LIKE SO MANY IN SAN DIEGO I HAD THE BENEFIT OF GETTING TO MEET THIS TRUTH. GENTLE GIANT- WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC POLICY IN FACT HE KEY SCHEDULED A MEETING WITH ME. AT THE LABOR COUNCIL ALMOST A WEEK AFTER I WAS ELECTED BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BRING ME HAND. TYPED PAGES OF HIS PLAN OF HOW I COULD HELP PUBLIC TRANSIT- SERVING AS THE HEAD OF LABOR AND SO I'M SURE I DID NOT DO ENOUGH. AND I'M SURE. HE WILL ALWAYS REMAIN A GIANT IN IN OUR- PERSPECTIVE IN SAN DIEGO I'VE NEVER MET SOMEBODY WHO HAS ANYTHING BUT A KIND WORD TO SAY. ABOUT THE MAN WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND I THINK IT'S TELLING AND MAYBE THE BEST. THE BEST TRIBUTE POSSIBLE THIS HIS FAMILY SAID RATHER THAN SEND FLOWERS THAT IN ORDER TO REALLY- APPRECIATE HIS MEMORIES THEY'VE ASKED PEOPLE TO TAKE A RIDE ON A TROLLEY A TRAIN OR BIKE.
