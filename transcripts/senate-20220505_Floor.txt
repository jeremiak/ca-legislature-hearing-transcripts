KNOWN AS MICRO. IT'S BEEN UNCHANGED FOR NEARLY FIVE DECADES- JUST AS A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE WHEN I THINK BACK TO WHEN I FIRST CAME THE LEGISLATURE THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO. THIS WAS A BIG ISSUE THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO AND IT HAS REMAINED SUCH. THE LAST. TEAM DECADES AND I THINK BACK ON THOSE WHO. ATTEMPTED TO IN SOME WAY MODIFY IT SOME WAY REFORM IT SENATORS LOCKYER IN A BIRDIE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- EISENBERG. SPEAKER WILLIE BROWN- THIS IS A COMPROMISE THAT PROVIDES A BALANCED EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR PATIENTS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. WILL KEEP HEALTH CARE ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE WELL BOUNCE APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION FOR CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HEALTH CARE RELATED INJURY OR DEATH. THIS BILL EXTEND THE LONG TERM PREDICTABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE FOR THOSE PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE IN CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDE A FAIR AND REASONABLE INCREASE THE LIMITS ON NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES IN MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. CASES CURRENT LAW. AND DOLLARS NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS THIS BILL INCREASES THE CAP FOR NON DEATH CASES FROM TWO R. CONTINUES TO INCREASE. THAT CEILING TO SIMILAR FIFTY THOUSAND OVER TEN YEARS. THE CAP FOR WRONGFUL DEATH CASES WOULD INCREASE FOR FROM TWO R. FIFTY THOUSAND TO. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND CONTINUES TO INCREASE TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AFTER TEN YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO THE CAP INCREASES IN TWENTY THIRTY THREE A 2% COLO WILL KICK IN STARTING JANUARY ONE TWENTY THIRTY FOUR AND WE'LL JUST THE CAPS. ANNUALLY WILL ALSO ESTABLISH NEW DISCOVERING EVIDENCE YOU PROTECTION FOR ALL PRE LITIGATION EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY REGRET OR BENEVOLENCE INCLUDING STATEMENTS OF FALL BY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE PHYSICIAN SHOULD. EXPRESSED SYMPATHY FOR AN INJURED INDIVIDUAL THAT THAT IS EXCLUDED. FROM EVIDENCE SB THIRTY FIVE ALSO CREATES THREE SEPARATE CATEGORIES OF DEFENDANTS. FOUR THREE POSSIBLE CAPS ONE CAP FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ONE CAP FOR HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS ONE CAP FOR AN UNAFFILIATED HEALTH CARE PROVIDER HEALTH CARE INSTITUTION COMMITS A SEPARATE NEGLIGENT ACT. THE BILL HAS PASSED UNANIMOUSLY UNANIMOUSLY THROUGH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THANK THOSE WHO WOULD WORK SO HARD- IN SO WELL. IN ACHIEVING THIS COMPROMISE THE- CALIFORNIANS ALLIED FOR PATIENT PROTECTION THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO REALLY DESERVE RECOGNITION. MISTER NICK RILEY- AND CHARLES JOHNSON LEADERS OF THE FAIRNESS FOR INJURED. PATIENTS INITIATIVE DR ROBERT WALES PRESENTLY CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MISS LISA MAAS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS ALLOWED. PER PATIENT PROTECTION GREG CAMPBELL LEE IN TRENTON AND OF COURSE NANCY TRAVELING CRAIG PETERS LEADERS OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA- THIS WILL GO DOWN AS SOMETHING THAT WILL ALL REMEMBER WE PASSED THOUSANDS OF BILLS THOUSANDS OF BILLS AND ONLY BUT A HANDFUL ARE THOSE THAT CHANGE CALIFORNIANS IN DRAMATIC WAYS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. I ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ABERG OPENING DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. SENATOR RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY FIVE AS A CO AUTHOR. FOR DECADES POLICY MAKERS AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE WORKED AND STRUGGLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE ON HOW TO BEST PROTECT PATIENTS. THIS YEAR WE ARE ACCOMPLISHING REMARKABLE WORK. I'M STILL ENCOURAGED BY THIS COLLABORATION AND OUR ABILITY AS CALIFORNIANS TO SHOW THAT GOOD PUBLIC POLICY CAN COME FROM PUTTING POLITICAL DIFFERENCES AND USE THE SITE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND NOT DOUBLING DOWN I WANT TO THANK THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN. SANTA ANA THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM CONSUMER ATTORNEYS TO THE SEMI AND ALL OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE THIS HISTORIC AGREEMENT WILL PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF INJURED PATIENTS AND IT ALSO STRIKES AN IMPORTANT BALANCE TO ENSURE LONG TERM PREDICTABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY SO TODAY I ENCOURAGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS FLOOR. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEEN RUBIO CENTER PAN. THANK YOU A MISS PRESIDENT- SENATORS- FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO OUGHT TO WANNA JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN THANKING THE- DEFENSE TO CAME UP WITH THIS VERY IMPORTANT HISTORIC TREATMENT- IN RELATION TO- DRESSING- LIABILITY- IT'S AND I HOPE THAT- YEAH AND THIS IS A- COLLABORATION AND AGREEMENT BETWEEN. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WHO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS AND THE TRIAL ATTORNEYS AND- I HOPE AND- THAT- THE DISSIDENTS AGREEMENT THEY HAVE COMMITTED THAT THIS IS AGREEMENT DOUBLE DOOR- SO CERTAINLY WE HEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE ONE SIDE THE OTHER- ASKING US TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND SO FORTH. BUT THIS IS A MUTUAL AGREEMENT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL AS AGAIN I SAY INDOOR AND THAT SO WE WILL NOT HAVE TO SEE A FUTURE BILLS SHOWING UP HERE- WITHOUT A CONTRACT WITHOUT AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALL THE PARTIES TO AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT. SO I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THOUGH IS THAT- CERTAINLY- IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT FIRST OF ALL THERE WAS NEVER EVER EVEN WITH MICRON A LIMIT ON ECONOMIC DAMAGES. NEVER EVER EVER SO THAT WE REMAIN ALSO CONTINUES TO RING TRUE IN THIS AGREEMENT THE DISAGREEMENTS LIFTING CAPS ON NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES SO IN OTHER WORDS WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE INJURED THEY WILL ALWAYS GET FULL COMPENSATION INJURY HAD IT BEFORE WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE IT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AS WELL SO THAT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK TO REMEMBER. SECOND OF ALL YOU'LL BE HONEST AS IT IS A- AS A PHYSICIAN- THIS WILL PUT UPWARD PRESSURE- BECAUSE RAISING THE CAPS ON HEALTHCARE COSTS THIS WILL RAISE THE OVERHEAD COST LIABILITY COSTS FOR A CLINICS HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS BUT IT DOES DO IN A WAY THAT IS- PREDICTABLE AND MANAGEABLE IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. SO THAT WILL AUSUBEL MINIMIZE THOSE COST PRESSURES AND COST INCREASES AND THAT'S WHY THIS DEALS ALSO SO VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL- THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN. MUCH HIGHER POTENTIALLY HIGHER INCREASES AND LESS PREDICTABLE ONES WHICH I COULD PUT A MAJOR PRESSURE ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO CONTROL HEALTH CARE COSTS SO THIS DEAL DOES ACHIEVE. I WELL CERTAINLY HAS CERTAIN EFFECTS IT CERTAINLY IS ONE THAT WILL LEAD TO. A BETTER SOLUTION MOVING FORWARD. AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE PARTIES WHO CAME TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS AGREEMENT. AND CERTAINLY- WILL BE SUPPORTING IT HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR PATTERSON EARLIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE HISTORY THAT CAME FROM CHAIR ON BURKE ON THIS- I HAD MY OWN HISTORY WHICH IS WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ IS THE HEALTH ANALYST IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR. WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF HAVING PHYSICIANS IN OUR AREA GOLDEN BEAR WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WE IN FACT HAD A WE HAD TO HIRE NURSES MIDWIVES IS COUNTY NURSE MIDWIVES BECAUSE THERE WERE OBGYN IS THAT WE'RE GOING OUT WITHOUT INSURANCE AND THAT THE ACTUAL DELIVERY OF SERVICE WAS THREATENED. AND THERE OF COURSE HAS BEEN A DEBATE ABOUT. WHETHER THAT WAS A MANIPULATION OF THE MARKET OR THAT WAS GENUINE BOUGHT IT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AND SO THE MARKET CAP WAS AGREED TO AS A COMPROMISE THEN. AND YET. OF THE COMPROMISE WAS THE TWO HUNDRED AND R. FIFTY THOUSAND CAP ON THE PORTION THAT WAS MENTIONED AND YET IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THAT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IS NOW. IT IS ROUGHLY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO WHILE THERE'S NO LIMIT ON THE ECONOMIC DAMAGES THE WOMEN ON THIS PART WAS KEEPING PEOPLE FROM GETTING REPRESENTATION THAT WAS THE REAL ISSUE THAT HAPPENED HERE. AND FOR THOSE OF US SITTING ON THIS FLOOR. WE HAD THE ISSUES OF- WHEN I WAS IN A LEGISLATIVE RACE IN TWENTY TEN. JUST THE FACT THAT I SAID THIS SHOULD BE INDEXED AS A CAP LED TO A MAJOR INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURE AGAINST ME IN THAT RACE. WHEN I WAS RUNNING A YEAR AND A HALF AGO I BASICALLY SAID. WE SHOULD MOVE ON THIS UNLESS EVERYONE'S IN THE TABLE AND THAT IS WHAT JUST HAPPENED. AND SO IN SALUTING EVERYBODY FOR THIS I THINK THE INTERESTING THING IS. IS THIS WAS KEPT A SECRET AS LONG AS IT WAS THIS IS SACRAMENTO AMAZINGLY IT DIDN'T FLOAT OUT THERE THAT THESE NEGOTIATIONS WERE GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME. AND THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE I THINK IF IT HAD. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD FOR SOME OF THE PLAYERS. TO HOLD THEIR PEOPLE IN LINE. AND IT GAVE THEM A CHANCE ONCE A DEAL WAS REACHED TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THIS WAS IN THEIR LONG TERM INTEREST. AND WHEN WE WERE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OUR HEART WAS ALL PREPARED TO SPEAK TO OPPONENTS AND I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE RANDOM OPPONENTS THAT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INTERESTS THOUGHT THAT THEY COULDN'T SUPPORTERS. BUT WHEN THE CHAIR CALLED FOR WITNESSES THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM AND THERE WAS NOBODY ON THE PHONE LINE. THAT IS MONUMENTAL BUT SOMETHING THAT IS THIS BIG DOES NOT HAVE ANY REAL OPPOSITION. AND THEN I APPRECIATE- OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS NAMING WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS BECAUSE I THINK. FOR THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN PARTICULAR HELLO. A CALIFORNIANS ALLIED FOR PROTECTION. WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTALONG WITH EVERYONE AND THE DOCTORS COMPANY- CONSUMER WATCH HANDS OF THE PROPONENT OF THE BALLOT MEASURE WELL I THINK. AS MUCH AS WE LIKE TO THINK THAT ABOUT MEASURE DOESN'T FORCE A SOLUTION IT REALLY HELPED. AND THE REFORM THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE. TO REALLY ALLOW FOR SOMEBODY TO PULL BACK AN INITIATIVE. REALLY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING THIS HAPPEN IF THAT WASN'T THERE- SO THAT RIGHT NOW IN THIS ACROSS THE BOARD AGREEMENT. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PULL IT OFF THE BALLOT FOR LEAST DOWNPLAY IT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT SO THIS IS A BIG AND I THINK THAT. THE TERROR ATTACKS FREQUENTLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR STATE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK THIS IS REALLY AN INSTANCE WHERE TRULY WORKS WERE WERE HAVING A LONG TERM SOLUTION. THAT'S OF BENEFIT TO ALL THE PARTIES THAT IS GOING TO REMOVE ONE OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES. IN STATE GOVERNMENT FROM THE TABLE SO I SALUTE EVERYBODY THAT WORKED ON THIS I AM REALLY PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE NIELSEN. MR PRESIDENT LADIES AND- THE SENATE I HAS COME AT THIS FROM KIND OF A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE. I SPENT MY CAREER DEFENDING MICRO. HAVING BEEN ALMOST KILLED BY THE THERE ONE TIME. BUT WHAT MY WIFE AND I HAD NO INTENTION OF FILING A LAWSUIT HEALTH CARE INSTITUTION MY COMMUNITY. AND THE BILL PROBLEMS I BECAME A VICTIM. BUT WE WANT TO WORK TO IMPROVE THE WHOLE SYSTEM FOR EVERYBODY. RATHER THAN THE NONSENSE WELL I'M USING THE WRONG WORD BUT- A LAWSUIT. THEN I FEEL JUST A TINY BIT BETRAYED BY THIS COMPROMISE WHY ANYBODY HAVE DEFENDED MICRO. I UNDERSTAND THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAS FOSTERED THIS COMPROMISE. AND IT PROBABLY HAS MERIT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE INDEXING OF 2% A YEAR. I DON'T LIKE INDUCTION. IT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC. AND THAT'S AUTOMATIC AS WELL. BUT I WOULD SAY WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS AND I MAY BE A PROBLEM THE ONLY ONE SO VOICES MY OPINION ON THIS. BUT MICRO HAS SERVED US WELL OVER THE DECADES MAYBE IT IS INDEED A NEW TIME. AND I PROBABLY SHOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS. BUT TODAY I WILL BE A NOBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR HOOKED HER TADO. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR BABY THIRTY FIVE IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF SOME CONSTITUENTS- MY FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE THAT BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT. THERE WASN'T AND WE'VE KNOWN THIS TO BE TRUE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY QUALITY CARE AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE STORIES I LEARNED THAT. THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO FIX. AND JUST REALLY UNFORTUNATE UP. STORIES THAT INDIVIDUALS YOUNG WOMAN COULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY HAD WE IN PLACE A. B. A SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IMPROBABLY PERHAPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT PROVIDES QUALITY CARE- INCLUDING AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND FOR THIS REASON I BEEN VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF CREATING CHANGES SO THAT. WE PREVENT HARM IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE PREVENT MISTAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S ABOUT. GETTING QUALITY CARE AND IF WE PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND THE EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING AND EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED I MEAN IT BENEFITS EVERYONE. SO I THINK THAT THIS BILL IF SOMEONE IS INJURED OR DIES AS A RESULT OF KEROPPI BUT THE RECEIVED THEIR FAMILY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO A REASONABLE COMPENSATION. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BRING BACK A LOVED ONE. OR REBUILD. EIGHT EIGHT IN LIFE- AB THIRTY FIVE REALLY. AB EIGHT INCREASES ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE A NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES IT A NUMBER THAT HAS BEEN INCREASED FOR. YOU KNOW THE HAS BEEN INCREASED FOR NEARLY FIFTY YEARS INCREASING THESE CAPS ARE NOT IT IT'S TIMELY BUT IT'S ALSO THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND- I'M PLEASED TO BE VOTING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY RESPUESTAS SUPPORTED AS WELL THANK YOU.
