OR HORMONAL DESTRUCTION. WE'RE

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:12.424
TALKING ABOUT TOXIC CHEMICALS

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:12.958
THAT ARE WELL KNOWN TO BE

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:17.729
HARMFUL. ORIGINALLY WE HAD LEAD

00:23:17.796 --> 00:23:20.532
MERCURY ASBESTOS FORMALDEHYDE.

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:22.367

RECOGNIZING YOU KNOW WHY IT'S

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:03.068
SO IMPORTANT THAT WE NEED TO

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:05.036
PASS THIS BILL. IN ADDITION WE

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:11.076
HAVE HAD NUMEROUS INCIDENTS.

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:14.012

CANCER ESPECIALLY AMONG AFRICAN

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:40.205
AMERICAN WOMEN. SO THE SCIENCE

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.374
IS CLEAR ON THE HARMFUL NATURE

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.175
OF THESE CHEMICALS AND WHAT WE

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:46.611
ARE PROPOSING IS TO ALIGN THE

THEIR BODIES. WOMEN OF

CHILDBEARING AGE ARE

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:47.499
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE AS THEY

00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:49.901
ARE THE PRIMARY CONSUMERS OF

PRODUCT RELATED CHEMICALS IN

00:27:55.673 --> 00:27:57.876
THEIR BODIES BECAUSE THEY USE

00:27:57.942 --> 00:27:59.811
MORE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND THE

00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:02.714

MUCH AS ANY OTHER AND THROUGH.

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.794
WORK IS IN THE BEAUTY INDUSTRY

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.395
ARE OFTEN REPRODUCTIVE AGE

00:28:17.462 --> 00:28:19.197
WOMEN FROM UNDER REPRESENTATIVE

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:20.932
GROUPS AND THEY MAY BE MORE

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.300
VULNERABLE TO THE ADVERSE

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:24.035
HEALTH EFECTS BECAUSE THEY

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.770
HANDLE THESE CHEMICALS ALL DAY

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:27.972
LONG. THEY ALSO MAYBE FACING

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.075
HIGHER CUMULATIVE EXPOSURES

HOME NEIGHBORHOOD AND WORKPLACE.

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:35.814
THE COSMETIC INDUSTRY ARGUES

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.015
THAT A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:38.583
CARCINOGENIC CHEMICAL IN A

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.351
CONSUMER PRODUCT ISN'T A COURT

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:41.953
CAUSE FOR CONCERN BUT THIS IS

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.223
SIMPLY NOT TRUE. SCIENCE TELLS

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.359
US THAT FOR HORMONALLY. ACTIVE

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:50.728
CHEMICALS EVEN SMALL EXPOSURES

00:28:50.795 --> 00:28:52.430
CAN CAUSE HARM FOR DEVELOPING

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:55.600
FETUSES EXPOSURE TO EVEN SMALL

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:57.068
AMOUNTS OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.503
DURING IMPORTANT TIMES OF

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.904
DEVELOPMENT CAN HAVE

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:02.073
IRREVERSIBLE IMPACT. AND PLACE

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.875
THE CHILD ON THE PATH FOR LATER

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.743
LIKE DISEASE AND THESE PROBLEMS

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.113
CAN PERSIST ACROSS GENERATIONS.

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.781
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BREAST

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:13.551
CANCER. BLACK WOMEN WHO AND IT

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.487
RECENT AND I. H. STUDY SHOWED

00:29:15.553 --> 00:29:16.821
THAT BLACK WOMEN WHO FREQUENTLY

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.463
FOR EXAMPLE A SPOUSE'S- THERE

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.097
ARE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THEY'RE

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:01.999
DIFFERENT FORSMAN STANDARDS

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:02.900
DEPENDING ON THE MEMBER

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:04.601
COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.737
UNION. AND WE COULD NOT COME UP

00:45:06.804 --> 00:45:08.806
WITH THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE TO

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:11.375
MEET- YOU NOTED THAT DEFINE ONE

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:14.078
STANDARD FOR AS BASSES AND SAID

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:15.212
THAT IS THE REASON WHY WE TOOK

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:17.181
IT OUT. THAT BUT I WANT TO MAKE

00:45:17.247 --> 00:45:19.716
IT CLEAR THAT THAT IS. YOU KNOW

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:20.851
FURTHER EMONSTRATION THAT'S

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.119
ABOUT AS GOOD AS DEMONSTRATION

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:24.555
AS AS I CAN GIVE OF OUR GOOD

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:28.058
FAITH COMMITMENT TO. MEET THE

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:30.394
STANDARDS OUTLINED THIS BILL

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:31.495
WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.597
EUROPEAN UNION BY TAKING OUT TO

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:37.267
A PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:37.801
CHEMICALS THAT WE ARE SEAT

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:43.640
ORIGINALLY SEEKING TO ADDRESS.

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:46.410
OTHER OTHER QUESTIONS COMES.

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:50.747
MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YEAH I'M JUST

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:52.449
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS AS

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:53.050
WELL BECAUSE OVERSEE THAT THE

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:55.552
LANGUAGE IS FAIRLY NEW WE

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:56.120
HAVEN'T EVEN AT TWENTY FOUR

00:45:56.186 --> 00:45:58.589
HOURS TO REALLY GO IN AND LOOK

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:01.692
AND DETAIL BUT THE COMMITTEE

00:46:01.758 --> 00:46:04.161
PRIOR WAS A TUESDAY OR

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:07.030
WEDNESDAY TUESDAY TO THURSDAY

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.332
SO I THINK WHAT WAS CAUSING ALL

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:09.600
THE PROBLEMS IS BECAUSE

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:10.167
EVERYTHING WAS LIKE YOU SAID

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:11.502
SCRAMBLED LATE LAST NIGHT TO

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:13.003
MAKE SOME CHANGES BECAUSE THERE

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.739
WERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE BILL-

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:16.740
I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:18.375
IN THE SOONER I THINK. THAT WE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.977
WOULD HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:22.212
HOURS TO REALLY FULLY THAT THE

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:26.150
LANGUAGE IN. THE TENT I WAS

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:26.750
ROOTING FOR SO I THINK THAT'S

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:30.254
PART OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL. I

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.289
KIND OF FEEL THAT IF YOU'RE

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:32.990
SHOULD HAVE. BEEN REALLY

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.091
COMMITTED AFTER THAT COMMITTEE

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:35.192
HEARING TO. START RODERICK

00:46:35.259 --> 00:46:36.360
GREEN THAT LANGUAGE THAT WE

00:46:36.426 --> 00:46:37.661
WOULD HAVE A DAY OR TWO RIGHT.

00:46:37.728 --> 00:46:39.329
NOW WE'RE LIKE UP AGAINST THE

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:42.399

THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:10.227

SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS

YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.328
KNOW THAT LAST YEAR THERE WERE

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.230
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND AT

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:21.732
THE TIME THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.100
YOU KNOW OR COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:25.869
ALSO DIDN'T FEEL PREPARED- AND

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:27.271
TO VOTE ON A AND THE BILL HAS

00:48:27.337 --> 00:48:29.840
CHANGED TO SOME EXTENT. I THINK

00:48:29.906 --> 00:48:31.541
YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.143
THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TRUST IN

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.779
ALL PRODUCTS I DID I KNOW AND

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:36.947
YOU KNOW I DID SOME WORK

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:40.017
RELATED TO LEAD- PREVENTION-

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.285
AND PRIOR TO GETTING TO THE

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:44.121
ASSEMBLY AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:48:44.187 --> 00:48:45.322
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LEADS-

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:47.357
FOCUS BILLS. THAT THE

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.059
LEGISLATURE MOVE FORWARD IN IN

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.927
TERMS OF HEALTH AND SAFETY SO

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.696
ALL TO SAY THAT THE PRODUCTS

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:53.830
THAT ARE OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:55.032
IN PAINTING IN MAKE UP IN A

00:48:55.098 --> 00:48:57.034
HOME ANYTHING THEY THEY HAVE AN

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.736
IMPACT ON THE ON THE HEALTH OF

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:02.472
A HUMAN- AND I THINK THAT. IT'S

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:05.509
SO IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT TH

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:08.111
PRODUCTS ARE ARE NOT USING THAT

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.780
THAT THE THAN THOSE

00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:10.747
MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS ARE

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:13.517
COMMITTED TO NOT HAVING THOSE

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:16.420
PRODUCTS. ON IN. DOES ELEMENT

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:17.587
IN THE PRODUCTS- AND I THINK

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.189
THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT IT SOUNDS

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:22.426
NOW THAT THIS IS- A MATTER OF

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:25.095
PROCESS IT'S A MATTER. OF WHAT

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:27.497
WE CAN YOU KNOW DO TO CLARIFY.

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:29.900
THIS PARTICULAR LANGUAGE THAT'S

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.568
BEING I THINK THAT MEMBERS HAVE

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:33.337
TALKED ABOUT. BUT I WILL BE

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:34.871
SUPPORTING THIS- AND I'LL BE

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:35.772
SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE THEY

00:49:35.839 --> 00:49:36.973
BELIEVE IT'S AND IT'S AN

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.176
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.610
THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING-

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.813
IT'S IN THE EARLY. SPACES THERE

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.681
IS STILL MULTIPLE COMMITTEES

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:46.516
THAT THIS THE BILL HAS TO GO TO

00:49:46.583 --> 00:49:47.751
SO I THINK THAT WHAT'S BEEN

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.486
IDENTIFIED AS A PROBLEM. HAS A

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:52.389
PATHWAY FOR A SOLUTION- AND I

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:55.092
THINK THAT IN THE END- I WANT

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:58.028
THE- CONSUMER TO FEEL THAT THEY

00:49:58.095 --> 00:49:59.996
CAN TRUST. THE PRODUCTS THAT

00:50:00.063 --> 00:50:02.132
THEY USE- AND THAT'S IN MAKE UP

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:03.700
AND ANYTHING ELSE AND SO- I

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:05.469
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT. I KNOW

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:08.372
THAT TO AND THERE'S YOU KNOW

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.407
LOTS OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:12.275
PROCESS ITSELF BUT I THINK IT'S

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.643
IMPORTANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.513
IF. AS THIS MOVES FORWARD- THAT

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.149
THERE COULD ALSO BE A WAY TO

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:22.819
ADD. A LINE- SOME OF THE

00:50:22.886 --> 00:50:25.989
CONCERNS I IT IN A WAY THAT'S-

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.858
POSITIVE TOWARDS THE BILL SO

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:30.394
THANK YOU. THE CHRISTMAS BURKE.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:31.661
I'LL BE QUICK I WANNA LINE MY

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:32.929
COMMENTS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:36.967
RODRIGUEZ AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:38.368
VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC I KNOW IT

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:39.870
IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT I KNOW

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.772
IT'S VERY VERY COMPLEX RIGHT

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:43.573
FOR ME I ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.075

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:47.511
AS- HOWEVER IT HOWEVER YOU DO

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:49.446
THAT AND CLARIFYING SOME OF THE

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:50.547
ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT.

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.983
UNCLEAR HOWEVER I HAVE NOT HAD

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.785

RUNNING IN AND OUT TRYING TO

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:56.787
MAKE SURE WE CAN UNDERSTAND

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:57.954
WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND OUR

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:59.456
OWN STAFF BUT I DON'T THINK I

00:50:59.523 --> 00:51:01.491
HAVE MY- ARMS WRAPPED AROUND

00:51:01.558 --> 00:51:03.193
THIS WELL ENOUGH YET SO FOR ME

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.761
I'M GONNA LAY OFF RIGHT NOW BUT

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:06.763
IF IT. COMES DOWN TO THE FLOOR

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.833
I LOOK FOR TO HOPEFULLY IT

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.400
BEING CLEANED UP TO A PLACE

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.269

SO YOU KNOW I WASN'T ON ESPN

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.682

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:29.085
I FEEL LIKE WALKING INTO THIS

00:51:29.152 --> 00:51:30.987
MOVIE WHEN IT'S HALFWAY. IS

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:33.156

THAT YOU RUSHED TO DO THESE

UNION. WE WERE ORIGINALLY

00:52:36.786 --> 00:52:41.992

OURSELVES WITH THE EUROPEAN-

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:05.415
THE STANDARDS. HOWEVER WHEN I

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:07.017
STARTED HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:07.884

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:10.220
SAYING THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:11.187
YOU KNOW JUST A COMMITMENT WE

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:15.158
WANT TO SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT-

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:18.228
PROMPTED US- AND RECORD AS TO.

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:19.663
TO HAVE TO SCRAMBLE TO MAKE

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:22.032
SOME HARD DECISIONS AND- SO

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:25.168
WHAT WE DID WHAT WE DID DECIDE

00:53:25.235 --> 00:53:25.735
AND WHAT IS BEFORE YOU RIGHT

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:28.438
NOW. IS YOU KNOW THE OF THE

00:53:28.505 --> 00:53:30.106
REMAINING CHEMICALS THOSE

00:53:30.173 --> 00:53:33.343
CHEMICALS- ARE. BANNED IN THE

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.579
U. E. U. AND OUR BILL IS

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.714
ENTIRELY ALIGNED WITH THE E. U.

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:38.548
BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.283
COMPLEXITIES WITH THE E. U.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.952
STANDARDS AS AS TO LEAD IN THIS

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:44.321
BEST THIS. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.255
COMMITMENT THAT'S WHY WE

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.890
ENTIRELY TOOK THOSE TWO

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:49.593
CHEMICALS OUT OF THE BILL. SO

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:51.227
THAT- IT DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.296
QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE YEAH I

00:53:53.363 --> 00:53:54.164
THINK IT IT IT PUTS YOU IN A

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.932
VERY DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.634
THERE'S JUST THREE DAYS AGO.

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.436
AND YOU YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY

00:53:59.502 --> 00:54:00.937
HAVE THE CAME TO DO IT BEFORE

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:02.772
TODAY BUT WORKING WITH THE

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:04.574
PARTIES BEFORE AS WE MOVE ALONG

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:05.709
OTHERS SAY THAT YOU WANTED TO

00:54:05.775 --> 00:54:06.776
GET THE BOOKS TODAY SO YOU TRY

00:54:06.843 --> 00:54:08.278
TO. RUSH IN THERE AND THAT'S

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:10.213
WHY IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S NOT

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.483
TIME. TO LOOK AT THAT SO I HAVE

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.085
ANOTHER OPINION ON THAT BUT

00:54:15.151 --> 00:54:16.019
THAT'S OKAY AS FAR AS THE

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.154
MERITS OF THIS- YOU KNOW

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:19.389
OVERALL WHEN YOU INTEREST AS A

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:21.157
YEAR AGO I THOUGHT OF THAT RISK%

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:23.393
REWARD IS THERE MORE REWARD TO.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.562
CONSUMERS AND ESPECIALLY YOUNG

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:26.730
PEOPLE WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:28.932
SECOND. OR MORE RESTED THIS

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:29.966
INDUSTRY THAT I WOULD CRATER

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:32.235
AND- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:35.105
STEPPED UP ABOVE. THE FDA AND

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:36.172
OTHER ISSUES AND SO I THINK

00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:38.041
THIS IS ONE WHERE CALIFORNIA

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.043
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD AND

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.612
IT WAS ESPECIALLY. DISTURBING

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:44.481
LIKE YOU MENTIONED TO SEEING

00:54:44.547 --> 00:54:45.649
THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE

00:54:45.715 --> 00:54:48.118
PRODUCTS. ON KIDS I HAVE TWEENS

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:50.487
JUST LIKE YOU. AND THEY'RE YOU

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:52.188
KNOW DYING TO GO THE NEXT STEP

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:54.124
BEYOND SPEAKING. LIP GLOSS HERE

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.826
AND THERE. AND THE THAT THAT'S

00:54:56.893 --> 00:54:57.894
THE BEST DOSE AND LET IN THOSE

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.562
PRODUCTS IS VERY DISTURBING.

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:02.365
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN SAY

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:03.533
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO STEP UP

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.935
THIS CALIFORNIA TO FURTHER-

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:07.170
PROTECT OUR CONSUMERS AND OUR

00:55:07.237 --> 00:55:09.873
KIDS IN. AN INDUSTRY THAT YOU

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:10.473
KNOW I THINK HAS A

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.275
RESPONSIBILITY TO GO ABOVE AND

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:13.810
BEYOND JUST TRYING NOT TO

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:18.281
INCLUDE THESE DANGERS ELEMENTS.

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:21.317
IN COSMETIC PRODUCTS. AND THE

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.719
THING THAT WE HEARD ABOUT FROM

00:55:22.786 --> 00:55:24.287
THAT ARE THE TWO ELEMENTS THAT

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:25.055
YOU TOOK OUT RIGHT. BEST US AND

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:28.091
LET. SO HOW. AND IT MAY NAY BE

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:28.658
STRONG ENOUGH IN THE FIRST

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:30.393
PLACE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.595
SO. HOW WOULD HOW WOULD YOU.

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:35.799
AGAIN SELL US THAT. YOU'RE

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:38.835
BEING- RESPONSIVE TO. ADMIT

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.503
THAT TO AT HEARING TO THE EASE

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:41.805
STANDARDS WITH THOSE TWO

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:44.340
PIECES. THE STATUS OF THAT. AND

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:48.044
THAT- THE OVERALL. IT TO

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:48.578
INCREASE THE SPEED OF YOUR

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:51.648
TRYING TO ACHIEVE GOING FOR. SO

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:54.017
AGAIN WE TOOK OUT. THE SPACES

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:55.752
AND LEAD BECAUSE THOSE WITH IT

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:58.088
THE TWO AND THE ONLY TWO

00:55:58.154 --> 00:56:00.423
CHEMICALS THAT WE HEARD- FROM

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:04.594
IS LEE THAT WERE. RAISING

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:06.963
CONCERNS WITH FEAR OPPOSITION

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:12.302
IN TERMS OF- DEFINING AND

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:12.836
ALIGNING WITH THE EUROPEAN

00:56:12.902 --> 00:56:15.805
UNION STANDARDS. BUT BECAUSE OF

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:18.441
THE COMPLEXITIES IN DEFINING

00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:21.044
THE EUROPEAN STANDARDS- ASKED

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:22.712
TO ONLY THOSE TWO CHEMICALS.

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:26.850
YOU KNOW RATHER THAN. TRYING

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:30.120
TO- TO COME UP OF LANGUAGE THAT

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:33.323
WOULD ADDRESS THE COMPLEX

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:35.125
COMPLICATED EUROPEAN UNION

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:37.560
STANDARDS- WE AT MEAN IN ORDER

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:40.697
TO. ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE BILL

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.432
OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:44.768
DECIDED TO DROP THOSE THOSE TWO

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:46.803
CHEMICALS ENTIRELY AS TO THE

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.538
REMAINING ELEVEN CHEMICALS WE

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:53.209
HAVE NOT HEARD ANY CONCERNS. UP

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:57.380
UNTIL NOW- AS TO THOSE ELEVEN

00:56:57.447 --> 00:57:00.316
CHEMICALS I BELIEVE THAT THOSE

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.452
ELEVEN CHEMICALS ARE ENTIRELY

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.187
ALIGNED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.689
STANDARDS MS LEE INDICATED AND

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:09.125
MY MEETING WITH HER THAT THAT-

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:10.527
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A GLOBAL

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:12.595
STANDARD. SO THAT WHAT IS SOLD

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:14.264
IN EUROPE CAN BE SOLD IN

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.666
CALIFORNIA SO THAT YOU KNOW

00:57:16.733 --> 00:57:18.234
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN ENJOY

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:21.471
THE SAME- MY PERSPECTIVES LIKE

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:22.472
A CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:24.440
ENJOY THE SAME PER. CONSUMER

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:27.210
PROTECTIONS AS THOSE A READY

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:27.777
BEING ENJOYED IN THE IN THE

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:30.547
EUROPEAN UNION. SO EVEN AS YOUR

00:57:30.613 --> 00:57:32.315
AIM LAW HOW WOULD YOU PROTECT

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:35.952
CONSUMERS AGAINST. EXPOSURE AND

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:38.822
PRODUCTS FROM LEAD IN THIS BEST.

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:40.590
SO THERE ARE CURRENT LAWS

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.492
FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT-

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.962
THAT TO- YOU KNOW ATTEMPT TO

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.164
REGULATE TOXIC CHEMICALS AND

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:49.999
COSMETICS BUT YOU KNOW AS WE'VE

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:52.001
SEEN AS A FROM THE RECENT

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:55.605
EXAMPLES OF PRODUCTS BEING SOLD

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.140

WHERE THE FTA AND- THE

COMBINATIONS AND THEIR ELEVEN

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:55.932
YEARS OF EXISTENCE IN THE

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:58.968
MEANTIME WE ARE SEEING A SPAZ

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:02.505

TO OUR MEMBER COMPANIES AND

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:30.920
THEY SAID- THAT. THAT'S A MAJOR

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:31.521
IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ORIGINAL

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:34.190
BILL AND PRINT. AND THEN WE ASK

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:35.691

FOR DPH TO ADD ADDITIONAL

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:45.501
CHEMICALS THAT WILL. WITH NO

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:46.936
SCIENTIFIC REVIEW NO RISK

01:01:47.003 --> 01:01:48.704
ASSESSMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THAT

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.940
WAS A HUGE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:52.775
AND SO WE MADE THE APPEAL ANY

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:54.110
SEM COMMITTEE TO FULLY ALIGNED

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:58.481

THAT WE HAD THAT AGREEMENT

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:02.452

01:02:06.155 --> 01:02:07.890
IMAGE EACH YEAR NOT. I'M NOT

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:08.958

ALIGNED THIS WITH THE E. U.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:21.270
WHICH OBVIOUSLY AT THIS POLICY

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:23.306
JUNCTURE. CAUSES A SERIOUS

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:25.374
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS AND I WOULD

01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:26.342

MEMBERS. I UNDERSTAND THAT-

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:10.520
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:12.188
DISCUSSION YOU KNOW UPON THIS

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:15.091
BILL FROM BOTH SIDES TRYING TO

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:17.793
GET TO PROGRESS TOWARDS THE

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.695
SOLUTION THAT CAN BE AGREED

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.597
UPON I APPLAUD BOTH SIDES FOR

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:24.433
WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS- YOU

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.237
KNOW. AS SOMEONE WHO- IS A HUGE

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.106
SUPPORTER OF NATURAL PRODUCTS

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:31.641
AND YOU KNOW NOBODY WANTS TO

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.643
SEE THE CHEMICALS ESPECIALLY

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.844
THE CHEMICALS ON THE LIST IN

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:37.313
THESE PRODUCTS THAT WE'RE

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.482
PUTTING ON OUR SKIN INTERFACE-

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.918
SO. EVEN ONE OF THE OTHER

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.252
ISSUES THAT I ALWAYS THINK

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:45.588
ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.089
I LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THE

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.257
FORMALDEHYDE AND HAIR

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.092
STRAIGHTENERS AND- A FEW YEARS

01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.595
AGO I HAD LOOKED INTO THAT AND

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:53.863
THERE IS A FROM ALL THE HYPE

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.599
FREE OPTION BUT IT COSTS OVER A

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:57.400
HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE THAN THE

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.668
ONE THAT HAS THE FORMALDEHYDE

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:01.170
IN IT. SO YOU LOOK AT MAKE UP

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:03.239
ON THE COUNTER AND THE LOWER

01:04:03.306 --> 01:04:04.907
COSTS MAKE UPS TEND TO HAVE

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.210
MORE THAN ARGUABLY THERE SOME

01:04:07.276 --> 01:04:08.978
SUBSTITUTES BUT THE TEN HAVE

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.780
MORE OF THE CHEMICALS IN THEM

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:11.781
THAN THE ONES YOU COULD PAY

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:13.449
MORE FOR A GOLDEN NORDSTROM AND

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.018
GET THE HIGH END PRODUCTS THAT

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.153
MAYBE DON'T HAVE SOME OF THOSE

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:17.820
OR YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:21.824
THEM- YOU KNOW BUT IT'S REALLY

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:24.460
A SOCIO ECONOMIC THING TOO WE

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:25.394
LOOKING AT DISADVANTAGED WOMEN

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:27.697
AND YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:28.798
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:32.268
CAN HAVE SAFE PRODUCTS FOR

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:33.869
EVERYBODY ACROSS THE SOCIO

01:04:33.936 --> 01:04:39.809
ECONOMIC- FRAMEWORK SO. IT'S AN

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.676
ISSUE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT I

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:41.277
THINKWE ALL AGREE THAT IT IS

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.747
IMPORTANT. SO THE AMENDMENTS

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.182
THE AUTHOR PLANS TO TAKE AN

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.084
APPROACH. TO ADDRESS MANY OF

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.720
THE REMAINING CONCERNS THERE'S

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:51.354
OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE HEARING

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.090
FROM THE OPPOSITION. BUT YOU

01:04:54.156 --> 01:04:55.324
KNOW ONCE AGAIN BECAUSE OF

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.392
THESE DEADLINES IT'S KIND OF

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:59.862
BEING PUSHED- SO I'M GOING TO

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.231
LAY OFF THE BILL FOR THE

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:02.732
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THESE

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:06.202
AMENDMENTS ACTUALLY IMPRINT.

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.769
AND HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.639
ANALYZE SOME. THERE'S ALSO TIME

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.007
TO HAVE A NEW BILL THAT CAN

01:05:11.073 --> 01:05:13.409
COME OUT AND CONTINUE ON AND I

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.243
THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.745
CLEANEST WAY TO DO IT IN THIS

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:16.879
YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.648
AN ISSUE THAT WE DO NEED TO

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:20.316
ADDRESS AND CONTINUE TO WORK

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:24.620
FOR SO- I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:25.721
SUPPORT A BILL WHEN IT COMES

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.189
YOU KNOW TO US EITHER ON THE

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.226
FLOOR MAYBE BACK AS A NEW BILL-

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.827
THAT IS CLEANER AND IN A LINE

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:34.063
WITH THE E. U. AND- THAT DEALS

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.631
WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:37.066
