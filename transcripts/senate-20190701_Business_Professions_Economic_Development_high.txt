AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE HER UP BY. TO PRESENT HER BILL WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER. SEVEN ASSEMBLY BILL -- THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM CURRENTLY BUT WILL. BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND WE WELCOME YOU TO OUR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M ALSO PRESENTING ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN SPELLING BEE THIRTEEN FORTY ONE DO YOU MIND IF I PRESENT THAT FIRST LIKE TO PRESENT THAT WOULD FIRST YES BUT YOU GET OFF TO A GOOD START BY PRESENTING YOUR BILL HOW WELL THEY WITNESS ASKED ME TO TAKE. THEIRS FIRST TO BE ONLINE IT'S OKAY IT'S ALL. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT I'M BETTER PREPARED OF MY OKAY SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN ON ITEM NUMBER. SIX ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN HIS ****. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAUER K. HAND TWO PRESENTS AND WE WELCOME YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON THIS BILL -- ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFFER THE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS BILL AND HELPING IT TO GET TO THE PLACES THAT -- WITH THE RECENT OFFERS AMENDMENTS AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE IS A NARROWER AND MORE SIMPLIFIED BILL THAT WOULD PREVENT COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES FROM INVADING STATE OVERSIGHT. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD REQUIRE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INSTITUTION THAT CLAIMS TO BE A NONPROFIT COLLEGE IS ACTUALLY OPERATING AS A NON PROFIT FOR PURPOSES OF RECEIVING AN EXEMPTION FROM STATE OVERSIGHT. THE BILL WOULD ONLY FOCUS ON NONPROFIT COLLEGES THAT PREVIOUSLY OPERATED AS FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TEN SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE STARTING TO USE AND NONPROFIT LABEL MISLEADING STUDENTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DODGING APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES ARE TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM. A DECLINE IN ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROFIT STATUS BY THE FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS ALLOWING SOME FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TO GET AWAY WITH USING COMPLICATED FINANCIAL SCHEMES AND SHELL CORPORATIONS TO LAY CLAIM TO THIS NONPROFIT STATUS. THIS EMERGING PROBLEM IS ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE GRAND CANYON EDUCATION INC IS A FOR PROFIT COMPANY TRADED ON THE NASDAQ THEY CREATED GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY AND CLAIM IT AS A NONPROFIT COLLEGE. HOWEVER THE PRESIDENT OF THE NONPROFIT GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY IS ALSO THE CEO OF THE FOR PROFIT GRAND CANYON EDUCATION INC IN ABOUT 60% THE TUITION REVENUE. THAT THE NONPROFIT COLLEGE RECEIVES FLOWS THROUGH TO THE FOR PROFIT COMPANY. AND GEORGETOWN LAW PROFESSOR NONPROFIT LAW EXPERT BRIAN GOLLY SAID THE NONPROFIT IS ESSENTIALLY A TRUSTWORTHY LOOKING WRAPPER AROUND A FOR PROFIT BUSINESS. THIS ARRANGEMENT MAKES A MOCKERY OF THE CONCEPT OF THE NONPROFIT. WITHOUT ANY OBJECTIVE CHECK ON THEIR NONPROFIT CLAIM THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WILL CONTINUE TO MISLEAD STUDENTS AND AVOID APPROPRIATE STATE OVERSIGHT. IN FACT OTHER COLLEGES ARE ALREADY FOLLOWING GRAND CANYON UNIVERSITY EXAMPLES AND CLAIMING NONPROFIT STATUS. THERE FOR CALIFORNIA MUST STEP UP AND STEP IN TO PROTECT OUR STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT REMAINS FOR THESE COVERT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES TRYING TO GAIN THE SYSTEM. TODAY WE HAVE BOB CHARMIN SENIOR FELLOW AND DIRECTOR OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND EXCELLENCE AT THE CENTURY FOUNDATION AND ANGELA PERRY POLICY ANALYST AT THE INSTITTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS. NOBODY IS THANK YOU THANK YOU RATE AND THE BEFORE WE HEAR FROM YOUR WITNESSES. I DO SEE THAT WE HAVE A A QUORUM PRESENT. SO I'D LIKE TO ASK HER TO CALL THE IF THE ROLE. GLAZER HERE GLAZER HERE CHIANG ARCHULETA YOUR ARCH LETTER HERE DOT. DOT HERE GALGIANI HILL YOU'RE STILL HERE LEYVA. THEY'VE BEEN HERE PAN WELL. OKAY SO WE DO HAVE A CORPSMAN BEFORE YOUR WITNESSES BECAUSE I DO WANT TO REMIND. THEM AND AND OTHERS THAT -- THE COMMITTEE PRACTICES BEEN TO ALLOW FOR TWO WITNESSES -- ON BOTH SIDES TRYING TO CONFINE THEIR REMARKS FOUR MINUTES CUMULATIVELY. AND WITH THAT WE WELCOME YOUR REMARKS YOU TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND TELL ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO ONE COULD BE REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT AN ENTITY WITH A TAX EXEMPT DESIGNATION FROM THE IRS WAS. LEGITIMATELY STRUCTURED AS A NON PROFIT MEANING ONE THAT IT'S INCOME WAS DEDICATED TO EDUCATIONAL AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES AND NOT EXTRACTED FOR PROFIT. AND SECOND THAT ITS GOVERNANCE OR HOW IT IS CONTROLLED WAS WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT CONFLICTS THE TRUSTEES. WERE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT IS BEST FOR STUDENTS AND THE COMMUNITY NOT WHAT LINE THEIR OWN POCKETS OF THE POCKETS WITH SOME CONTRACTOR THAT HAS A STRANGLEHOLD ON THEIR FINANCES. UNFORTUNATELY OUR ABILITY TO RELY ON THE IRS DESIGNATION IS GONE DUE TO AN UNRELATED CONTROVERSY OVER POLITICAL NON PROFITS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. FOR PROFIT OPERATORS HAVE BEGUN TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS SITUATION SETTING UP SHALL NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS GETTING AN IRS EXEMPTION AND USING THAT IN THEIR MARKETING. IN A RECENT CALL WITH INVESTORS THE CEO OF THE NASDAQ TRADED NONPROFIT UNIVERSITY GRAND CANYON. BOASTED QUOTE BEING OUT THERE A MILLION TIMES A DAY SAYING WE'RE NONPROFIT HAS HAS HAD AN IMPACT. HE WAS REPORTING A PROFIT MARGIN OF 34%. NOW OTHER FOR PROFITS WENT TO FOLLOW THIS MODEL WHICH THEY ARE DECLARING AS THE INDUSTRY STANDARD A NONPROFIT UNIVERSITY THAT STEERS 6265% OF ITS REVENUE TO ONE SOLE SOURCE COMPANY WITH A LONG TERM CONTRACT THAT IS VERY TOLD DIFFICULT. FOR THE NONPROFIT TO GET OUT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE SAYS THESE TYPES OF SO CALLED NON PROFITS THOSE THAT HAVE CONVERTED DO NOT HAVE THIS DO NOT HAVE THE STRUCTURE THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS. AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT GET THE EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE PART OF CALIFORNIA'S REGULATORY APPROACH. AS IN MANY OTHER STATES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY AUTHORITY ON THE LEGITIMACY OF NOT OF A NONPROFIT ENTITY. THIS BILL PROMS AND AG REVIEW OF FORMER FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS SEEKING CALIFORNIA EXCEPTIONS AS NONPROFIT. IT ALSO CLARIFIES WHAT ARE CONSIDERED PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS BEYOND OUR THREE PUBLIC SEGMENTS. THANK YOU AND I ARE CHEN I'VE OF THANK YOU NEXT NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MY NAME IS ANGELA PERRY I'M A POLICY ANALYST WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS I'M HERE TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WHICH WOULD PREVENT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION FROM EVADING STATE OVERSIGHT. BY MISREPRESENTING THEMSELVES TO STUDENTS AND TAXPAYERS. NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO DEVOTE SCHOOLS REVENUES TO EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE AND LEADERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM TAKING A PROFIT -- RAMPANT DECEPTIVE AND UNFAIR TREATMENT OF STUDENTS HAS BEEN RARE ILLEGITIMATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES BECAUSE OF FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THE SCHOOLS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT. FOR THEM TO BE BAD ACTORS IN THE SPACE WE AE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS WHICH LEGITIMATELY SEEK TO CONVERT TO BECOME NONPROFIT HOWEVER. AS AN ENFORCEMENT OF NONPROFIT STATUS HAS BEEN HAS DECLINED AT THE FEDERAL IRS SOME OF THE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS HAVE STARTED TO USE AN ILLEGITIMATE NONPROFIT OR PUBLIC LABEL TO TRACK STUDENTS WHO ARE SUSPICIOUS OF FOR PROFIT. COLLEGES AND TO ESCAPE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. THIS PROBLEM IS ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS AN INSUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAS MADE STATE ACTION ESSENTIAL. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO EXERCISE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT PUTS CALIFORNIANS AT RISK AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WOULD PREVENT THOSE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS FROM INVADING STATE OVERSIGHT AND DECEIVING STUDENTS. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY OTHER OTHERS HERE WHO. ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THAT WISH TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES BY NAME AND ORGANIZATION PLEASE COME ON UP.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF ASHFORD UNIVERSITY -- THE SCHOOL THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF DOING JUST THAT A CONVERSION FROM A FOR PROFIT ENTITY TO A NOT FOR PROFIT ENTITY -- IN THE IN THE HOPES OF GETTING AWAY FROM A MORE SHAREHOLDER CENTRIC WAY OF GOING ABOUT OPERATING A SCHOOL AND COMING MORE STUDENT CENTRIC A SORT OF THAT IS THE REASON AND RATIONALE. FOR I BELIEVE THE ASHFORD IS GOING THROUGH I THINK IT IS VERY LEGITIMATE MNEMONICS DANCE OF CALLS WITH THEM. AND IN THE MIDST OF SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS FIGHTS BETWEEN THE TWO ENTITIES IN TERMS OF STRUCTURING THIS -- IF THERE WAS AN ARMS LENGTH DEAL AND NOT A SHAM CONVERSION I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY IT -- WE'RE CURRENTLY OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED WE THINK THAT -- THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD MORE NEUTRAL ARBITER AT LESS POLITICIZED PROCESS THAN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. OFFICE IS IS A BETTER -- PLACE FOR THE STRUCTURE FOR THIS TO BE. REVIEWED AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE -- OUTSIDE COUNSEL -- MISTER TONY GUIDA TO TO TOUCH ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS -- I REPRESENT -- AFTER UNIVERSITY OF THEIR OUTSIDE COUNSEL I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY -- THAT PRACTICES EXCLUSIVELY IN HIGHER EDUCATION -- EIGHTY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT STRESSES AFTER UNIVERSITY DOES NOT OPPOSE ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY -- FOR TRANSACTIONS LIKE THIS -- THEY ALREADY NEED TO HAVE AS AS MISTER CHAIRMAN MENTIONED APPROVAL BY THE IRS -- APPROVAL BY THEIR REGIONAL CREDITOR -- THE WASHER -- SO THE ISSUE IS IS JUST WITH -- THE THE MANNER IN WHICH IT'S DONE IN MAKING SURE THAT IT'S DONE IN A WAY THAT SAID THAT THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS -- WITH RESPECT -- TO NONPROFIT THE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CURRENTLY -- APPROVES -- TRANSACTIONS WHERE -- NONPROFITS ARE ARE EXITING FROM BEING A NON PROFIT -- IN -- WHETHER IT'S BY SALES POTENTIALLY ALL THE ASSETS ARE WITH RESPECT -- TO THE THE THE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS HOSPITALS NONPROFIT HOSPITALS SELLING TO A FOR PROFIT HERE -- A WIN -- INSTITUTION IS IS TRYING TO BECOME A NONPROFIT -- IN CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD -- REVIEWS THE TRANSACTION AND WE WOULD WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT THEY WOULD BE A BETTER -- PLACE -- FOR THE REVIEW TO OCCUR -- THERE'S THERE'S CURRENTLY A FORM OF THE TO USE THAT IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE PAGES THERE ARE THERE'S THERE'S A SPECIAL SECTION IN THE FORM IN THE REVIEW OFFER HOSPITALS WE WOULD ASK THAT -- EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ALSO -- CONVERTING -- COULD COULD BE ADDRESSED IN A SIMILAR WAY -- IN ANOTHER -- A PROPOSED AMENDMENT AND THAT THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT -- WE WOULD HAVE OUR A RESTRICTIONS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY T GO DIRECTLY TO COURT -- WHICH CAN OCCUR WITH RESPECT TO A SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE ASSETS TO AVOID -- A POTENTIAL ISSUES AND AND AND YOU KNOW POLITICALLY SHOULD TO SUCH A WE HAVE A QUIRK MAKE BASICALLY MAKE THE DECISION -- AND I GUESS THE THE FINAL POINT IS THERE IS THERE IS LANGUAGE I HERE WHERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS TO REVIEW AND DETERMINE WHETHER QUIRK FUNCTIONS -- REMAIN WITH THE INSTITUTION -- CORE EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONS IS IS IS IS A TERM OF ART AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WALK FOR INSTANCE I HAVE SPECIFIC POLICIES FOR A AND A AND THEN IF I SEVEN QUIRK FUNCTIONS -- THAT CANNOT BE. GIVEN BY AN INSTITUTION IS SOMEBODY ELSE SO WE WE JUST ASK THAT FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE ACCREDITED BY WHY ASK THAT THAT DETERMINATION BE MADE BY WHAT -- AND NOT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- GET ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COME UP AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS ANGIE MINETTI HERE ON BEHALF OF SYLVIA ALSO ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEN -- NO FURTHER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SENATOR DODD. YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE YOU -- SOMEBODY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION HERE -- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES OF ATTORNEY GENERAL AND AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD THEY TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS THE DOMINANT AGENCY. THAT MAKES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF NONPROFIT ASSETS WHETHER WHEN INDIA AND ISSUES OF PRIVATE INURNMENT WHETHER SOMEBODY IS PROFITING OFF OF A NONPROFIT. ORGANIZATION -- IT IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE IRS BECAME THE ARBITER ON THESE ISSUES BASICALLY. THROUGH A FLUKE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS A TAX THAT IT WAS THAT YOU GOT A TAX EXEMPTION MADE IT A TAX ISSUE THIS IS REALLY MORE A CONTROL AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUE. THAN A PAYMENT SENATE ISSUE OF THE PAYMENT OF TAXES. I WROTE SO I GUESS MR -- SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS IS WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT -- THAT THEY HAVE. FOR YOUR GIVE A TO THE BOARD WAS DEPORTED WITH THAT SIR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TRYING TO TAX BOARD. I MEAN REALLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF THIS IS A SHAM ARE NOT AS SHE AND YOU THINK THAT'S THAT'S NOT. GOOD ENOUGH. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS WHERE THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY LOOK AT ISSUES OF CAN GENERAL AND HOLDING WAS SOMEONE PROTECTION. TO THE WEST OF THE POT I HAVE NOT THE ONLY THE ONLY SITUATION I HAVE FOUND WHERE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD -- EXAMINED THIS KIND OF AN ISSUE WAS RELATED TO BLUE CROSS AT SOME POINT IN THE PAST I AM NOT I HAVE NOT GONE BACK AND LOOKED AT YOU KNOW OTHER. OF THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS THE ONLY ONE THAT I'VE SEEN IN HISTORY. SO MY UNDERSTANDING FOR THE AUTHOR IS THAT AND THE NONPROFIT THE ROLE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND MANAGING NONPROFITS AS WHY HE CHOSE THEM AS THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION IN CALIFORNIA TO BE HANDLING THIS AND I KNOW HE'S IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. IS WORKABLE FOR THEM AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. YEAH THE THE CALIFORNIA HAS A DIFFERENT ONE AS SOMETHING OF THAT. I RECOGNIZE YOU AS OUR CALIFORNIA HAS A PROVISION IN THE SENATE BECAUSE IT MIRRORS -- TO FIVE A ONE TWO THREE A SECTION OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE IN ITS. IT'S IT'S IN THE TAXATION CODE SECTION TWO THREE SEVEN OH ONE D.. AND IT READS A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND OPERATED EXCLUSIVELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES NO PART OF EARNINGS TO WHICH A NURSE TO THE BENEFIT OF ANY PRIVATE SHAREHOLDER INDIVIDUAL AND WE WOULD WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT'S THE SAME -- REQUIREMENTS THAT IS BEING IMPOSED IN IN THIS BILL -- FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LOOK AT IN IN. THE FOR TO CHECK FOR HAS A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE IN IN REVIEWING IF THAT'S WHAT THEY DO INTEREST MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S A IT'S A VERY HIGHLY REGARDED -- AGENCY WITH IN CALIFORNIA. CENTER DOT I GUESS I'VE GOT TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. IT SOUNDS LIKE EITHEROR YUP WOULD BE SATISFACTORY WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ABOUT GIVING IT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I'LL ME TRYING TO HANDLE AT EIGHT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE. BELIEVES THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IS A POLITICIZED -- INSTITUTION I THINK THAT THEY GO AND THEY LOOK AT SORT OF THE FOUR CORNERS AS WE SAID IN POSSIBLY LOOK AT FOUR CORNERS OF THE AND AND MAKE YOUR DETERMINATION. BASED UPON THAT THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE LAW AND ONE THING THAT CONCERNS US I THINK SHOULD CONCERN OTHERS. IS THAT YOU'RE GOING -- TO AN ENTITY. FOR BETTER FOR WORSE THAT IS A VERY POLITICIZED -- INSTITUTION AGENCY AND SO I THINK WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE MAKE SURE THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE PROCESS IS THAT IT IS AN IMPARTIAL PROCESS. AND AND NOT A POLITICAL PROCESS. I EITHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WELL AT THE MEDIA. SAY I I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN TO WORK ON THIS YEAR YEAH I I AM SENSITIVE TO THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED -- BY A COUPLE OF INSTITUTIONS -- BUT FOR ME I I A L. WELL THERE'S SOME CRITICISM OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AT TIMES -- OVER THE DECADES FOR MAYBE -- ALLOWING POLITICS -- TO TO EMERGE -- I THINK BY BY A BY A WIDE MARGIN THEY TO AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB WITH GREAT PROFESSIONALS THEY'RE AND IF IF WE HAD AN EXAMPLE OR EXAMPLES OF OF WHERE THERE'D. DETERMINATIONS HAVE BEEN SO CALLED POLITICIZED I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ASK US TO COME BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. ATTHAT ISSUE. TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO HAVE TO CHANGE AND AND HOW THIS. THIS BILL IS HIS PROPOSED -- IS IS IMPLEMENTED -- BUT I DON'T -- I DON'T SEE THIS AS A POLITICIZED ISSUE -- AT THE MOMENT. AND I DO THINK THAT -- WHAT'S BEING SUGGESTED HERE IS -- IS A PRUDENT COURSE I WOULD LIKE TO ASK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THE ANALYSIS RAISES HIS -- CLARIFYING HOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROVIDES NOTICE TO AN INSTITUTION AND THE ZERO ABOUT A DETERMINATION -- AND THE CRITERIA THAT'S REGRETS HOUSTON I GUESS I WOULD ASK YOU ON ON HIS BEHALF. TO CONTINUE TO WORK -- TO CLARIFY THAT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. THAT TIES IS OKAY WITH YOU AND WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY CLOSING MAYBE COMMENT UPON THAT. YES AND I KNOW THAT I AM MR BERMAN IS COMMITTED IS IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT NOTICE AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO NOTIFY. THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION IS COMMITTED TO THAT ONGOING WORK AS THIS. BILL HOPEFULLY LEAVES THE COMMITTEE AND I WANT TO JUST ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THE STATE'S TOP LAWYER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL AND THEY WORK HARD TO PROTECT. THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING OUR STUDENTS AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THATWAS WHY MISTER BERMAN GAVE THIS AUTHORITY TO THEM AND I THINK HE IS OPTIMISTIC THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ISLAND. VERY GOOD MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION FOR THE SHARING YOUR CONCERNS IS THERE A MOTION FROM MY COMMITTEE SENATOR ARCHULETA. MOVE THE BILL. WITH THAT THE SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHIANG ARCHULETA I ARCHULETA AYE DODD. DODD AYE AYE GALGIANI. GALGIANI AYE HILL. HILL AYE LEYVA. LIVE AYE PAN HI CAN I WILL. ALL RIGHT SAID THAT CURRENTLY HAS ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT WILL HOLD A REAL OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO NOW I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. THE ITEM SEVEN ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR THANK YOU AGAIN -- I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF AND THE CHAIR FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL PROVIDING GUIDANCE AND THAT GUIDANCE WAS SO HELPFUL THAT HELPED US REMOVE OPPOSITION SO I APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION. AND TODAY I AM PRESENTING ON A. B. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH PROVIDES CRITICAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND SAFEGUARDS TO THE NEARLY HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. ENROLLED IN ONLINE FOR PROFIT OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THE LARGEST LARGER SHARE OF CALIFORNIANS ENROLLED ONLINE AT SCHOOLS AND OTHER STATES ARE ENROLLED IN THESE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLE BUSINESS SECTORS TODAY. THESEINSTITUTIONS ARE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE WORSE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION PROVIDERS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE TOOK STEPS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM POSSIBLE PREDATORY OUT OF STATE ONLINE BUSINESSES BY REQUIRING THEM TO REGISTER WITH THE BUREAU. OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY OF POST SECONDARY PRIVATE EDUCATION. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW APPLIES ONLY TO THOSE PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA NOT THOSE THAT A ROLL CALIFORNIANS STUDENTS FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE. THIS BILL EXTENDS AS REFORMS IN CURRENT LINE EXTENDS PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS A REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR THESE OUT OF STATE SCHOOLS BUT NO WAY FOR THE STATE TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS AT THE SCHOOLS REMOVE THE ABILITY TO ENROLL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AT A SCHOOL WHICH MAY POSE A REST TO THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THESE INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION IF YOU'RE A WHICH MIGHT SIGNAL THAT THERE'S A REASON FOR CONCERN INCLUDING PENDING INVESTIGATIONS OF LAW AND LAWSUITS AS WELL AS ACCREDITATION PROBLEMS. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR WILL REQUIRE THESE DISCLOSURES AND ADDITIONALLY OFFER A COMPLAINT PROCESS FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AS WELL AS CREATE KEY ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT WILL CLOSE THE GAP BETWEEN STUDENTS ENROLLED IN STATE INSTITUTIONS. AND THOSE WHO CHOSE TO ENROLL IN ONLINE IN PROGRAMS LOCATED OUT OF STATE. WITH ME TODAY IS ANGELA PERRY AGAIN TO TESTIFY AS WELL AS AT HOWARD FROM THAT CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO AND I WILL TURN IT OVER. ANGELA. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK -- AGAIN ANGELA PERRY WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIRD AB. THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR OUT WELL SOME HOPE THAT ONLINE EDUCATION CAN HELP MORE STUDENTS EARN COLLEGE DEGREES. THE PROMISE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION ALSO HAS PERILS. THE CHALLENGES IN ASSESSING ACADEMIC RIGOR AND STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS CAN BE EVEN GREATER THAN IN TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS AND THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF OVER PRICED AND POOR QUALITY PROGRAMS LEAVING STUDENTS WITH DEBTS THEY CANNOT AFFORD. OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE ENROLLED IN HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS BASED EXCLUSIVELY ON LINE MOST OF THESE ARE EXCLUSIVELY AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WERE TUITION IS LOW AND CREDITS TYPICALLY TRANSFER EASILY TO OTHER UNIVERSITIES HOWEVER THERE ARE NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA AND ROLLED ONLINE. IN PROGRAMS WHICH ARE LOCATED OUT OF STATE. AND THE LARGEST SHARE OF THE STUDENTS ARE AT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES WERE STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO END UP WITH THE DEBT THEY CANNOT REPAY. THE AVAILABLE DATA SHOW THAT THERE'S REASON FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STUDENTS OUT OF STATE INSTITUTIONS THAT AND ROLL CALIFORNIANS ONLINE HAVE WORST STUDENT OUT CUT THROUGH LOAN OUTCOME PREPAYMENT RATES. THAN DO CALIFORNIA BASED ONLINE PROGRAMS. FOR HIS HISTORY WITH PREDATORY PER FOR PROFIT COLLEGES HAS LED TO THE CREATION OF MANY PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THESE PROGRAMS HOWEVER THE LOTS OF TRADITIONALLY ONLY APPLIED. TO STUDENTS LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA -- AND ATTENDING SCHOOLS LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE TOOK AN IMPORTANT STEP BY CREATING A REGISTRATION PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA HOWEVER THE REGISTRATION PROCESS -- SUFFERS FROM THREE FATAL FLAWS A FIRST. THE STATE LACKS THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO IDENTIFY RISK TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SECOND STATE LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO REVOKE SCHOOLS REGISTRATION IF A PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED. AND THIRD THE SYSTEM LACKS A COMPLAINT PROCESS MEANING STUDENTS HAVE NO WAY TO IDENTIFY ISSUES TO THE BUREAU DIRECTLY. AB THIRTEEN FORTY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD FOR THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE I OUT WE HAVE A STUDENT STORY FROM IT NATALIE LINES OF THE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATES THAT SHE CAN SHARE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN WARNING. AB MY NAME IS NATALIE LINES I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN OAKLAND WE REPRESENT HUNDREDS OF STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. A SUSAN CURTIS IS ONE OF OUR CLIENTS SHE'S WORKING TODAY SO I'M GONNA BE READING A STATEMENT FROM HER. IF YOU COULD JUST SUMMARIZE IT AGAIN TO SENSITIVITY TO TIME AND THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SURE OKAY I'LL. BE BRIEF ALL CREDIT THAT IMPORTANT POINTS. MY NAME IS SUSAN CURTIS I WANTED TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE ATTENDING HOPPING UNIVERSITIES ONLINE PROGRAM BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. PROTECT STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLING IN ONLINE EDUCATION PROGRAMS -- I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE THAT SUSAN AND ROLLED IN KAPLAN'S PARALEGAL PROGRAM. AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE -- SHE WAS CHARGED UNIVERSITY LEVEL FEES FOR AN ASSOCIATE PROGRAM THAT DIDN'T PREPARE HER TO ENTER THE MARKET PLACE AS A PARALEGAL. AND LEFT HER WITH LOANS IN EXCESS OF THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- SHE WE DID NOT RECEIVE BASIC SKILLS AND SHOULD NOT RECEIVE HER LEGAL SPECIFIC SKILLS. OUR PROFESSORS MADE THEM BY BOOKS BUT THEN HE DID NOT TEACH FROM THE MATERIAL THAT THEY MET THEM BY -- THERE WERE LOTS OF TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE TO NOW. FOR EXAMPLE. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE OTHER TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM AND SHE EXPERIENCE SHE HAD SHE FAILED A CLASS BECAUSE YOU TAKING EXAM AND THE PROGRAM FINDER OUT AND SHE COULDN'T FINISH THE EXAM -- THEY SAID THEY HAD CAREER SERVICES WHEN THEY AND ROLLED HER AND THEY DIDN'T HELP HER FIND AN INTERNSHIP THEY WOULD EVEN HELP HER WITH HER RESUME. AFTER SHE GRADUATED WITH HER CERTIFICATE SHE COULDN'T EVEN GET A JOB AS A LEGAL SECRETARY SHE CONTINUES TO WORK AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT FOR ABOUT EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR WHICH IS WHAT SHE WAS. DOING BEFORE SHE GOT THE CERTIFICATE. THE FIND FINALLY AND JUST ONE LAST SENS FROM HER BECAUSE I THINK I'D LIKE TO AT LEAST LET HER BE PRESENT TODAY. I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM MISLEADING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY ONLINE SCHOOLS JUST BECAUSE SCHOOLS ARE BASED OFFICE WHERE THEY SHOULD NOT GET A FREE PASS. AND SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS AS OF THE CALIFORNIA BASED SCHOOL. THANK YOU FOR SHARING HER STORY. THROUGH OUR THAT USED UP ALL THE TIME SO THAT LIKE TO ASK YOU COULD SUMMARIZE REMARKS THAT I'D APPRECIATE IT. PLEASE DANCE REQUIRE A AT HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LOS CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INTO SORT OF REPUBLICAN FLOOD PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. AND PERSONAL NOTE OF THANKS TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF NOT JUST FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL BUT FOR ALL OF THE BILL.

THAT THAT'S THE IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE IF YOU SAY WE'VE GOT HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS -- EVEN OF THE THOUSANDS THAT THAT ARE. THEN ROLLED IN SOME OF THE SCHOOLS. AFTER THIS BILL IS PASSED. HOW DO WE CUT IT OFF HOW DO WE FIND THE BAD GUYS SEPARATED FROM THE GOOD GUYS AND WHAT IS THE PUNITIVE ACTION THAT WE SHOULD TAKE? TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NO LONGER IN PRACTICE. WALK ME THROUGH THAT. YES SO THIS BILL REALLY. LOOKS AT THE QUESTION OF AND THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AND TAKING REGISTRATION A FROM THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE GETTING THAT -- WE KNOW ARE HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC I UNDERSTAND IN MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THE CHAIRMAN AND THAT COMMITTEE STAFF. THAT IT ISN'T CLEAR THAT THAT WILL TAKE ALL OF THESE FOLKS OFF OUT OF THE MARKET BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE. OPERATING WITHOUT THE REGISTRATION SO I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST STEP AND I THINK YOUR POINT IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS AND MAKE SURE PROTECTING CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND FARE WARS MORE TEETH THAT WE FOLLOW UP. IN AND I WOULD IMAGINE THERE SHOULD HAVE TO BE SOME DISCLOSURES PUBLICLY. ABOUT THE CRITERIA THE SCHOOL TO GRADUATION RATE SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE PUBLICLY OUT THERE SO STUDENTS CAN GO ONLINE AND SEE THE PROS AND CONS OF APPLYING AT THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE COST. ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOB THAT THEY GOT OR THEY DIDN'T GET. IT RIGHT YEAH. THIS BILL DOES REQUIRE THOSE DISCLOSURES AND IT MAKES THEM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SO THAT IF YOU ARE SHOPPING FOR AN INSTITUTION YOU CAN GO ONLINE AND COMPARE AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE BUYING A PRODUCT THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE EDUCATION YOU NEED HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S DANCE I'M.

YOUR COMMITTEE -- YOU'RE NOT HERE EARLIER WHEN WE BEGAN BUT I I WANTED -- TO SAY AGAIN HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THOSE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR THIS FULL PACKAGE OF PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY BILLS THAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY -- VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY IMPACTFUL TO SO MANY OF OF CALIFORNIANS AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD WORK IN THIS AREA. WITH THAT LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON OUR BILL AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE PACKAGE -- THAT IS RESPONDING TO RECENT ACTIONS BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EDUCATION SECRETARY DEVICE. OF ABANDON CRITICAL PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS AGAINST PREDATORY FOR PROFIT COLLEGES THAT HAVE PRIORITIZE PROFIT OVER STUDENT SUCCESS. ARBIL AB THIRTEEN FORTY WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM OVERPRICED INEFFECTIVE CREW TRAINING PROGRAMS BY PROVIDING ESSENTIAL DATA TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS IN THE PUBLIC ON GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. AT PRIVATE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. THE FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE WAS IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT OBAMA TO ADDRESS AN ALL TOO COMMON STORY STUDENTS PROMISED BY RECRUITERS THAT THEY'LL FIND A JOB IN AN INDUSTRY. WHO TAKE OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT? ONLY TO FIND UPON GRADUATION THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE JOB THAT THEY WERE PROMISED. THERE THEN UNEMPLOYED UNDEREMPLOYED FACING ASTRONOMICAL DEBT REPAYMENTS OR EVEN LOAN DEFAULTS. THE VICTIMS ARE TYPICALLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES VETERANS WOMAN -- AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND OTHERS. BASED ON THE INITIAL DATA FROM THE FEDERAL EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PROGRAMS FOR A CALIFORNIA DID NOT PASS THE TEST. THESE PROGRAMS GRADUATED OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO LEFT SCHOOL WITH ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. LAST YEAR TRUMP AND ABBAS MOVE TO SCRAP THE FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE FUELING THE GROWTH OF PREDATORY SCHOOLS AND ABANDONING SAFEGUARDS THAT HAVE PROTECTED OUR STUDENTS. TODAY'S HEARING ON THIS BILL IS VERY TIMELY BECAUSE THIS PAST FRIDAY US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SECRETARY TO BOSS FORMALLY RESCINDED THE ROLE. SCRUBBING THE RULES ALSO ELIMINATED A CRITICAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON THE ACTUAL WAGES THE STUDENTS AREN'T AFTER GRADUATING. IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ROLE THE ONLY SOURCE OF INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AT THE SCHOOLS OR VERY LITTLE ON RELIABLE ALUMNI SERVICED A SURVEY DATA. OUR BILL IS PASSED BY THE ASSEMBLY WOULD'VE REINSTATED A VERSION OF THE GAME FROM POINT ONE CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR YOUR STAFF FROM GAUGING WITH US ON AUTHOR AMENDMENTS AS CURRENTLY AMENDED FOR THIS COMMITTEE. AB THIRTEEN FORTY WILL TAKE A MAJOR STEP TOWARD MAKING FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS MORE ACCOUNTABLE AROUND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. BY CLOSING A MASSIVE GAP IN OUR STATE OUTCOMES DATA FOR THESE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS OUT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS. BY CREATING A PROCESS FOR WAGE DATA MATCH WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. THE MATCH DATA WILL THEN BE AGGREGATED BY PROGRAM AND BY INSTITUTION AND POSTED IN A DATABASE ON THE BUREAU'S WEBSITE FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE. THE STATE WILL SHED LIGHT ON THE ACTUAL WAGES THAT STUDENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR AN AFTER GRADUATING. AND ALLOW PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS THE PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE ACTUAL QUALITY AND WORTH OF SOME OF THESE DEGREES. IN THE NEAR FUTURE OUR HOPE IS ONCE WE HAVE THIS DATA WE CAN DETERMINE NEXT STEPS TO PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS WHO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ABANDONED OUR STUDENTS DESERVE BETTER WITH THAT WHEN I TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. HELLO I ANGELA PERRY WITH THE INS FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS -- I'M OFF I'M HERE TO OFFER SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY WHICH WOULD MAKE RELIABLE VERIFIED OUTCOMES DATA FOR FOR PROFIT SCHOOL STUDENTS AVAILABLE. FOR STUDENTS TAXPAYERS AND POLICY MAKERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME. STUDENTS AT PRIVATE COLLEGES OR IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT HAD ACCESS TO RELIABLE VERIFY DATE O OUTCOMES. MANY STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO NO DATA AT ALL AND THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE IS UNRELIABLE IN INCOMPLETE. THIS MEANS THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE INVESTMENT THEY ARE MAKING WHEN THEY ENROLL IN SCHOOLS AND TOO MANY BAD ACTORS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS TO PREY UPON STUDENTS OF COLORS. STUDENTS OF COLOR FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS FOSTER KIDS SINGLE MOTHERS AND VETERANS. THIS LACK OF DATA ALSO LEAVES POLICYMAKERS WITHOUT THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY IN CALIFORNIA. ALL THREE OF THE PUBLIC SEGMENTS HAVE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OUTCOMES DATA FOR THEIR GRADUATES CREATED THROUGH A DATA MATCH WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. AND AS PLANTS DEVELOP TO CREATE A STATEWIDE LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA THAT SAME EDT DATA WILL ALSO POVIDE THE WORKFORCE OUTCOMES FOR THAT SYSTEM. AB THIRTEEN FORTY REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THAT SAME EDT DATA AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS AT FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS THAT AS WELL IT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO INCORPORATE THE STUDENTS INTO THE CRADLE TO CAREER DATA SYSTEM AS IT DEVELOPS. AB THIRTEEN FORTIES MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE STREAMLINED THE BILL WILL STILL PREFERRED PRESERVING THIS ESSENTIAL DATA MATCH ENSURING THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WILL HAVE ACCURATE DATA EVEN AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE BEEN WITHHOLDING INFORMATION. AND ROLLING BACK PROTECTIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL ENERGY -- I'VE VOTE AND WE HAVE AN A STUDENT TEST MANY TREES IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE YOUR STORY. GOOD MORNING OF MANY MORE RESEARCH ON THIS IS MY THIRD TIME COMING TO SACRAMENTO TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT ROLE. AT FIRST I TOLD THE I'D COMMITTEE ABOUT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ATTENDING A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT LEAVING ME WITH NEARLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. AND A WORTHLESS DEGREE WITH CREDITS THAT WILL NOT TRANSFER. I TOLD THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE THE STORIES OF MY CLASSMATES. HOW MANY OF THEIR FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL LIVES HAVE BEEN RUINED BY? THE EXCESSIVE DEBT AND LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT JOB PROSPECTS. THEY'RE LIKE TO ADDRESS AND THE IDEA THAT THE INDUSTRY TALKING HEADS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL CONTINUE TO HARP ON THEY'RE CLEARLY DOING THEIR BEST TO CONVINCE THE PUBLIC THAT THE FOR PROFIT EDUCATION INDUSTRY HAS PUT STUDENTS FIRST. AND OTHER MOTIVES ARE IN SOME WAY ALTRUISTIC BECAUSE THEY SERVE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT THERE ARE ONLY STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY THE VAST PUBLIC EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ALREADY EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA. THESE STUDENTS ARE LEFT WITH FEW OPTIONS IN THEIR FINANCIAL. EIGHT AND STUDENT LOAN DOLLARS ARE BOON TO THIS INDUSTRY AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS. I CURRENTLY WORK AS A NURSING ASSISTANT SO I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. FROM THE HEALTHCARE FIELD. A QUICK SEARCH YESTERDAY SHOW ME THAT I TUITION AND FEES FOR A VOCATIONAL NURSING PROGRAM IN A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE COSTS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. A TUITION COMPARISON SHOP SITE SHOWED ME THAT ONE LARGE FOR PROFIT OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA CHARGES A WHOPPING FORTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE HUNDRED EIGHT FOR THAT SAME EXACT PROGRAM NOT INCLUDING BOOKS AND SUPPLIES. ANOTHER LARGE FOR PROFIT CHARGES A BIT LESS THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FOR THE SAME PROGRAM AND PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THESE FOR PROFIT OR TEACHING THE EXACT SAME CURRICULUM. BY LAW FOR LICENSING. AND PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THE EXACT SAME LICENSING EXAM. BOTH OF THE FOR PROFITS I MENTIONED HAVE LOWER PASS RATES AND HIGHER DROPOUT RATES. SO YOU TELL ME WHICH OF THE STUDENTS YOU THINK ARE MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE WITH THE EXCESSIVE THAT. I CAN'T BEGIN TO FATHOM HOW THEY JUSTIFY THAT SORT OF EXCESSIVE TUITION INFLATION. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I SEE THEM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LARGE POPULATIONS OF STUDENTS WHO CAN'T WHO EITHER CAN'T FIND AN OPEN SPOT? AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR FEEL THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. BUT TO PAY NEARLY SIX TIMES THE AMOUNT FOR THE EXACT SAME PROGRAM. I SEE THEM SUCKING UP INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN IN STATE GRANT MONEY. WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY TO PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION TO STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE A WELL INFORMED CHOICE ABOUT THEIR EDUCATIONAL AND FINANCIAL FUTURES. SO I ASK YOU. WHY THE SCHOOL SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO THE SAME EXACT STANDARDS AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA? IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT LEGISLATORS DO THE JOB THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEEMS UNWILLING TO DO AND PROTECT STUDENTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TERESA AND WHAT WAS THE DEGREE THAT YOU -- WENT THROUGH A PRIVATE COLLEGES WAS A NURSING DEGREE NO THAT CAME AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND A JOB BUT I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN VISUAL JOURNALISM.

OF FIRST I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE CHAIRMAN THAT THE BUREAU -- HAS NOT DONE THE JOB THAT I THINK WE NEED IT TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SECTOR.

THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY IS -- TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT UP WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THIS PACKAGE IS NOT -- IN A IT'S NOT A 100% INDICTMENT OF THE FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO TARGET THE BAD APPLES IN THE INDUSTRY. WHO HAVE REALLY OUT LETTER STUDENTS DOWN AND LET TERESA AND FIFTY SIX THOUSAND OTHER STUDENTS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL FOR WHO PAID FOR A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT?

THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE THAT I INVITE YOU TO BEGIN AS YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIR -- FIRST THANK YOU FOR A WORKING WITH US AND THANKS TO YEAR -- CONSULTANT AS WELL FOR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE IT IS A NEW WANTS TO ISSUE. AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THEWITNESSES AND SUPPORT OPPOSITION THAT WERE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE AT HAND AND AS WE NOTED EARLIER. THIS IS A A BIG INDUSTRY IN OUR IN OUR STATE AND OUR NATION IS HAS ITS. PLUSES AND IT CERTAINLY HAS ITS THE NEGATIVE AS WELL. IT'S NOT. A PERFECT INDUSTRY AND AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT -- IS PARAMOUNT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE PROTECT STUDENTS AND THE GOAL THIS BILL IS FOCUSING ON THE RECRUITMENT IN THE FRONT END -- IN ESSENCE IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PURPOSE MANY TIMES PEOPLE ARE PAID TO GET PEOPLE IN THE SEATS LITERALLY THEIR **** IN THE SEATS. WE WANT TO CHANGE THE DYNAMIC SO PEOPLE ARE COMPENSATED TO CAP SUCCESS THINK OF A CAP AND GOWN AT THE END OF THE DAY -- SO CURRENT LAW -- ONLY PREVENTS THESE KICKBACKS BY -- EMPLOYERS OR EMPLOYEES FOR ENROLLING STUDENTS -- AND DOES NOT INCLUDE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THIS WOULD CHANGE THAT LOOPHOLE -- WE VIC WE'VE PUT FORWARD AMENDMENTS TO WE THINK ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS WAY TO TERMINATION AND EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BASED UPON -- OVERALL PRACTICES AND WORK BY THE BY THE INDIVIDUAL -- WE'RE STILL OKAY -- FINE TUNING THIS ISSUE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. GOING BACK A STEP A WIRE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE ALL OF THESE SO CALLED -- SCANDALS -- ALL THE SCANDAL START WITH THEIR SO CALLED RECRUITERS AND AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES. AND PAGES SEVEN EIGHT THERE ARE COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THESE HIGH PROFILE -- TACTICS IN ONE EACH USE COMPLAINTS AGAINST ASHFORD A COUPLE YEARS AGO INDIVIDUAL TESTIFIED AS FAR AS THAT TEAMS RINGING CAL BELLS AND A TRUE BOILER ROOM ATMOSPHERE THAT REMINDED THEM OF THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT DECISION LAST YEAR WITH ACADEMY OF ARTS THERE IS EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS GETTING THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASES. AND THE POTENTIAL DECREASES FOR FAILURE TO MEETING IN ROME AT TARGET TO GET AS FAR AS ENROLLMENT VERSUS SUCCESS WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE WERE TRYING TO FOCUS ON IS HAVING STUDENT GET SUCCESS AS OPPOSED TO JUST GETTING THEM. ROLL THE SEAT BECAUSE ROLE IN THE SEAT COMES WITH -- FINANCE RELATED MANY TIMES -- A LOT OF STUDENT DEBT WITHOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE END OF THE DAY -- WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT FRANKLY IS CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CURRENT. A SECRETARY FOR EDUCATION TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS FOR A FOR PROFIT COLLEGES IN THESE KICK BACKS AND IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE SUPPORT OUR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT OUR BEST INTERESTS. SO THIS WOULD CODIFY THESE PRACTICES IN STATE LAW. AND ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO GO AFTER THESE. INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T -- PROTECT THEIR VULNERABLE STUDENTS WE KNOW THIS IS A THAT I I'VE THAT COHORT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE MARGINALIZED MANY TIMES IN THE FIRST PLACE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR NOT A LOT OF YOU KNOW FINANCIAL BACKGROUND TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING. THEMSELVES INTO SO WE WANT TO PROTECT THEM ON THE FRONT END AND FOCUS ON ACTUAL STUDENT SUCCESS AT THE BACK END -- WITH ME TODAY ARE MY TWO WITNESSES THAT AS STUDENTS AND A PRACTITIONER. IN THE FIELDS OR START WITH MY STUDENT THANK YOU WELCOME. MY NAME IS STANDING RIGHT -- SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON SUPPORTING -- AB THIRTEEN FORTY FIVE AND I WENT. TO MURNAU'S SCHOOLS OF BEAUTY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND I DID NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR A GED. THEY DOCTORED IN ATV TEST THAT UP MADE IT SO THAT I WOULD PASS. AND UP. I WOULD RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM FEDERAL STUDENT. LOAN -- MONEY AND SO. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE ENROLLED AT MARANELLO AT LEAST WHILE I ATTENDED WAS EITHER ON SOME SORT OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE OR THE THEY HAD TO HAVE THEIR PARENTS COSIGN. FOR THEIR LOANS. SO. WHILE I WAS IN ATTENDANCE THERE. EVERYONE MIL. IT WAS VERY APPARENT THAT. MARANELLO SPECIFICALLY PRAYED ON PEOPLE OF COLOR LOWER INCOME -- MANY TIMES FAMILY IS THAT YOU KNOW SINGLE MOTHER. FAMILIES AND THEY WANTED THE MAXIMUM FEDERAL LOAN FROM EACH STUDENT. THE SCHOOL WENT AS FAR AS TO ENROLL STUDENTS LIKE ME WHO DID NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR A GED. AND THEY ALSO WENT AS FAR AS TO CREATE A THE TISSUE SCHOOL AND LA AND MADE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS FOR STUDENTS THAT LATER ON WERE -- WORTHLESS [inaudible] SO -- LIKE I SAID I WAS ONE OF THE STUDENTS THAT HAD A DOCTORED ATB TEST. THEIR SHARED ME THAT -- WHEN OUT IN ROLE THAT I WOULD BE? MAKING TEN TIMES MORE MONEY THAN I WAS AT THAT TIME WHICH WAS ZERO SO I YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE BAIT -- IS THE THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED THEY SAID IT'S OKAY TAKE THE TEST SO I TAKE THE TEST AND JUST LIKE THEY SAID I GUESS I GOT AN AND NOBODY THAT. ATTENDS THESE TYPES OF SCHOOL SHOULD EVER MAKE MINIMUM WAGE AND I HAVE NOT FOUND A JOB. IN A SENSE. TWENTY TWELVE THAT PAYS MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE -- THE SCHOOL RECEIVED BY FEDERAL PELL GRANT ON MY BEHALF WITHOUT MY CONSENT OR KNOWLEDGE. AND I FOUND THAT OUT MUCH LATER. ALTHOUGH MY LOTUS WERE. WERE FORGIVEN IF I DECIDE I WANTED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. I WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEDERAL PELL GRANT. AND THAT WAS A BIG -- PUSH FOR ME BECAUSE I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY SO -- JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR. THAT WOULD MEAN THAT -- I'D HAVE TO BEG AND BORROW MY MOM AGAIN. FOR RENT -- AND DUE. TO MARANELLO AS THE STAY IN ON MY CREDIT. I CANNOT BUY A HOUSE LIKE I CANNOT BUY A CAR. I CAN'T EVEN GET A CREDIT CARD IN MY NAME [inaudible] AT ALL. AND I HAVE TWO SMALL KIDS. SO THIS IS REALLY BEEN A STAIN ON MY CREDIT AND IT'S TAKING YEARS -- TO TRY AND WIPE CLEAN. I WAS PROMISED LIFELONG JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE AND THAT I WOULD MAKE. LIKE I SAID TEN TIMES MORE MONEY WITH MY COSMETOLOGY LICENSE WHICH WAS NOT TRUE -- I MADE MORE MONEY WITHOUT MY COSMETOLOGY LICENSE THAN I DO WITH IT -- THIS WILL COMPLETELY YOU COULD JUST WRAP UP THANK YOU YEAH. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE AND SHARING YOUR STORY. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SCHOOL'S BEEN SHUT DOWN IT HASN'T CHANGED THAT TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU FOUND YOURSELF VERY SORRY. TO HEAR THAT. I KNOW THAT'S A PART OF WHY THIS BILLS BEFORE US IN YOUR TESTIMONY VERY COMPELLING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU BUT BY TWO OTHER WITNESSES -- MEMBERS PLEASURE TO BE HERE AT HOWARD WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LOS CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY OFFENSIVE VETERANS LEGAL CONNECTIONS ARE FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW. THIS IS ONE OF THE BILLS WELL I SHOULD FOR SAY THAT THE POINT OF THIS BILL IS TO FACILITATE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS IMPORTANT. LAWS -- AND PRINCIPLES OF BY BRINGING CLARITY TO CURRENT LAW AND BY BRINGING THE BEST PARTS OF FEDERAL LAW DOWN INTO CALIFORNIA HOW DOES THIS BILL DO THIS. FIRST IT STRIKES THE DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEES THAT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ALSO CAN'T BE PROVIDED OR OFFERED KICKBACKS TO GET -- TO USE THE COLORFUL PHRASE REAR IN CINCY. THAT IS ALREADY FEDERAL LAW ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY ALREADY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THAT. IT INCLUDES FINANCIAL AID AS AMONG THE THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT KICK BACK FOR THAT IS ALREADY FEDERAL LAW. ALL THE PEOPLE HERE WHO MIGHT OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY ALREADY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THAT. IT SAYS THAT THE BILL ADDS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY -- DIRECTLY FROM FEDERAL LAW THAT TO PREVENT WINK AND NOD ARRANGEMENTS -- AND IN BED THAT CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT IS NOT NOVEL. THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM FEDERAL LAW. EVERYONE WHO IS WHO MIGHT OPPOSE THIS BILL ALREADY HAS TO COMPLY WITH THAT BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW. THE BILL ADDS THE WORD CONTINGENT IN THIS IS A CRITICAL ADDITION TO THE BILL. AND THAT IS ON SCENE AND EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE LAW. AND THE REASON THAT'S IN THERE IS BECAUSE IT BENEFITS INSTITUTIONS BY CLARIFYING ABSOLUTELY CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A STRICT LIABILITY STANDARD. BUT THERE HAS TO BE A CONTINGENT QUID PRO QUO ARRANGEMENT THE VIOLATE THIS LAW. THAT BENEFITS INDUSTRY BUT IT BENEFITS STUDENTS TO BY OFFERING CLARITY AS TO WHAT THE LAW DOES PROHIBIT AND WHAT IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT. AN ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS BILL USED THE WORD SUCCESS. IT IN ORDER TO DEFINE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WERE PROHIBITED. WE DELETED THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION OBJECTED TO THAT IS AMBIGUOUS EVEN THOUGH THAT COMES FROM FEDERAL LAW. ON WE DELETE A NEW POLL I'M SORRY WE ADDED EXEMPTION -- AT THE REQUEST OF AT A UT I WOULD BECAUSE SHE DID. A TERRIFIC I THINK EXEMPTION FOR THEM. OUT WHERE BY. THE IF THERE OR COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS ACTUALLY GET TO THE CAP AND GOWN. THAT HELP PEOPLE GO FROM ENROLLMENT ALL THE WAY TO GRADUATION WE CLARIFY THAT THAT'S NOT ILLEGAL IN THOSE INSTANCES THE INTERESTS OF STUDENTS IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD INSTITUTIONS ARE COMPLETELY ALIGNED A VERY HELPFUL AMENDMENT. THAT ISN'T SEEN IN EITHER FEDERAL OR STATE LAW CURRENTLY AND FINALLY -- AMONG THE MORE AND PERHAPS. MORE DOMINANT OF THE DISCUSSION IS WE ADD THE WORDS CONDITION. EMPLOYMENT RECOGNITION A CONTRACTOR BENEFIT. NOW. THOSE WORDS ARE NEW. BUT IT IS A CLARIFICATION. OF KINDS OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY ILLEGAL HOW DO WE NOTICE. WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE THE CASE. THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT IS ILLEGAL TO DOCK SOMEONE'S PAY. FOR FAILING TO MEET A QUOTA. BUT ENTIRELY LEGAL TO FIRE THEM FOR FAILING TO MEET THAT QUOTA. THE ANSWER IS NO THE BEST READING THE BEST READING OF CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW EMBEDDED IN THE WORD COMPENSATION. IS THAT INCLUDES FIRING PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T MEET A QUOTA BUT IT ISN'T REALLY CLEAR AND THE SMARTEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ENFORCEMENT FROM THE NUMBER TWO WAS. WE WIN TOO MUCH. WHAT HE MEANT WAS YOU COULD FINISH UP YES THANK YOU? WE WENT TO MUCH MEETING. WE NEED THE THE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE FACILITATE CLEARLY IN THE LAW THE FACILITATING FORCE WHAT NOW. IT IS FAIR THE WHOLE EAST. ME IN PARTICULAR BY THE PETARD CLEARED. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE CAME WE CAME VERY CLOSE WITH ONE INSTITUTION ONE WORD AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT AN AGREEABLE DEFINITION TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN STILL FIRE PEOPLE. WHO ARE NOT PERFORMING? IT IS FAIR TO HORSES MIGHT ACT WE ARE AN ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH. THE OPPOSITION AND WE ARE AT ONE POINT WE GOT ONE WORD. AWAY SO IT HAS COMPLETELY ARE PHILLIP CHANCE TRY TO ADDRESS THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AS WE HEAR FROM THE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

ALL RIGHT OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OF THE GUYS OF ORGANIZE YOURSELF -- THE UP PROPONENTS TO GO OVER TIME SO BE SURE THAT -- THERE IS EQUAL TIME PROVIDED TO YOU. IF NECESSARY [inaudible] WITH RESPECT [inaudible] OKAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MAP BACK REPRESENTING CAPS OF CAPS IS THE LEADING ASSOCIATION FOR CALIFORNIA REPRESENT A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS. WE'VE BEEN ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL FOR WELL OVER A MONTH WE'VE OFFERED TO SET OF AMENDMENTS -- I THINK I AGREE WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING THESE SUPPLEMENTS AT WE WE DO NOT ONE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING KICK BACKS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. TO INSURE MORE STUDENTS EITHER -- IN ROLLING THE INSTITUTION OR GET MORE FINANCIALLY. AND IN FACT IS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT CURRENT LAW AND FEDERAL LAW VERY CLEAR ON THAT ISSUE -- POTENTIALLY MAYBE ONE OF THE ISSUES IS ENFORCEMENT -- WE DO KNOW THE BUREAU -- HAS HAS KIND OF HISTORY IN A BACKLOG OF OF THINGS IN AND MAYBE THEY ARE NOT DOING IT. BUT IRONICALLY THE FEDS AREYOU MENTION THE ACADEMY OF ART THEY PAID A SIGNIFICANT FIND TO THE FEDS JUST LAST MONTH TO PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE UNDER THE SAME PROVISION OF LAW. SO THE FEDS ARE EVEN UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION. ON ENFORCING THE LAW. SO WHAT IS THIS BILL DO IN MIND WE HAVE CONCERNS. IT HAS A LOT OF VAGUE AND NEW TERMS THAT WILL PRESENT A BUNCH OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. FOR INSTANCE THE BILL SAYS ANY CONTRACT AND ANY BENEFIT FOR ANY PERSON INVOLVED IN RECRUITING ENROLLMENT CONTINUE IN A MOMENT ATTENDANCE. EVERY EMPLOYEE IN OUR SCHOOLS WILL TOUCH ONE OF THOSE THINGS AT ANY GIVEN DAY. CAN WE NOT PROVIDE FOR A ONE CASE THAT'S IN ANY BENEFIT CAN WE NOT PROVIDED PENSION PLAN CAN WE NOT PROVIDE A YEAR END BONUS IF ANY OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WERE AT ANY POINT INVOLVED. IN THOSE ACTIVITIES. NOW ONE OF THE MAIN PROVISIONS THAT WERE CONCERNED WITH IS SOMETHING CALLED THE CONDITION THE EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS CERTAINLY A NEW TERM FOR THE SPACE. CONDITION THE POINT SO WE HAVE ENROLLMENT WE HAVE ADMISSIONS FOLKS THEIR JOB. IS TO TALK TO STUDENTS AND GET STUDENTS INTERESTED IN THE UNIVERSITY OR THE INSTITUTION RIGHT THEY CAN'T GET PAID BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FOLKS THEY BRING IN. BUT THEIR JOB IS TO MAKE CALLS THEIR JOB IS TO FOLLOW UP ON EMAILS THEIR JOB IS TO PROVIDE TOURS THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. SO IF WE CAN'T CONDITION EMPLOYMENT BASED ON THOSE ACTIVITIES WE COULD NEVER TERMINATE AN EMPLOYEE FOR NOT DOING THEIR ROUTINE. ACTIVITIES. SO AGAIN THE GENERAL PREMISE OF THE BILL WE AGREE WITH. WORDS MATTER. AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF IN THIS BILL WE PROVIDED TWO SETS OF AMENDMENTS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE. I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD A THOROUGH DISCUSSION ON THE BILL. AND A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS -- SO WHERE WERE OBVIOUSLY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT WITH THE WITH THE OFTEN SPONSORS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE ANY OF OUR CONCERNS TODAY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. HI THANK YOU -- I'M HERE AGAIN ON BEHALF OF ASHFORD UNIVERSITY AND WEEK WE JUST HAVE ONE ISSUE -- THAT WOULD LIKE TO REYES AND IT HAS TO DO HAVE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH RESPECT -- TO THE THIS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ROLE AS IT'S REFERRED TO THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE BUNDLED SERVICES EXCEPTION -- AND THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT IS -- THE BY BY THE THE AMENDMENT TO THE TO THE STATUE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN BRINGING IN THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OF ENTITIES THAT THE CONTRACT WITH BOTH OF FOR PROFIT AND IN NONPROFIT EVEN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE A GROUP OF SERVICES. TO AN INSTITUTION SO PRESENTING IN CALIFORNIA-THERE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROFIT INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE CONTRACTS WERE SOMEONE WILL COME IN. AND IN AGREE TO DEVELOP MARKET AND AND EVEN OFFER IN IN IN IN PART A PROGRAM AND THEY GET PAID BASED ON REVENUE. I AM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- THE BUNDLED SERVICES EXCEPTION PROVIDES THAT IF IF THE THE RECRUITING SERVICES ARE BUNDLED WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER SERVICES. AND THE THIRD PARTY IS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY AND YOU'RE NOT PAYING SPECIFICALLY FOR RECRUITMENT. THAT THAT'S AN EXCEPTION TO THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ROLE IN WHAT WITH WITH CONVERSATIONS AT THAT THAT I'VE HAD WITH THE SPONSORS IT'S UNCLEAR -- AT LEAST WHETHER THE BUNDLED SERVICES EXCEPTION WOULD APPLY TO THE CURRENT ITERATION OF THE ROLE AND AND REALLY ARE OUR ONLY REQUEST FOR AN AMENDMENT IS TO JUST MAKE IT CLEAR -- BUT THAT OF THE BUNDLED SERVICES EXCEPTION DOES IN FACT APPLY IN CALIFORNIA. VERY GOOD -- OTHER WITNESSES -- IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON FRED JONES ON BEHALF OF THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OUR ASSOCIATION WITH -- MATT BACKS COMMENTS IN TOTO BUT VERY SPECIFICALLY OUR PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL WAS. DISINCENTIVE VISINE DOES THAT HELP STUDENTS ACTUALLY FINISH GRADUATE WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A STEP TOO FAR AND YOU MENTION GETTING THEM TO THE CAP AND GOWN.

MICHAEL ARNOLD CALIFORNIA NORTH STATE UNIVERSITY ALSO POSED FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT SUBDIVISION M. ON PAGE SEVEN WHICH IS. THE PROVISION.

GREAT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I WILL BRING THE ISSUE BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] CENTER PATH. THANK YOU SELLER MCCARTY AND I THINK THAT -- ISSUE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE BUT THE BELL -- COULD PERHAPS CAN YOU OR YOUR SPONSOR ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS AND WHERE YOU ARE AND YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THEM THE FEEL LIKE THAT. BOB THIS AT OFTEN WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE TO TELL ME IT I MEAN. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S WAY TO RESOLUTION OR YOU ARE IS THERE A IS THERE -- OR DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S YEAH YEAH YEAH ALTHOUGH. WE DON'T RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITE YEAH HALL TURNED OVER TO MY WITNESS IT IN A SECOND BUT I WILL NOTE THERE IS A OF A LIST OF ISSUES THERE BUT MANY OF THEM AS YOU HEARD. THERE'S NOT DISAGREEMENT FROM WHAT THE GOAL IS AND WHAT CURRENT PRACTICES WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO. IS JUST UP SOMEWHAT -- IN THE DEFINITIONS OF AT IF WE'RE ABLE TO THE SIXTY TODAY AND MOVE ON TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE BIG PICTURE I'M. MORE THAN WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND BRINGS TOGETHER TO HELP TO BRING UP -- A RESOLUTION WE HAVE TAKEN SOME ISSUES OFF THE TABLE -- AND WE TEMPTED TO TO PUT THESE FORCES AMENDMENTS ON THE TWENTY FIFTH TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE KIND OF HASHING THEM OUT TODAY. LET ME LET TO MISTER HOWARD. EXPENSE. THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR THANK YOU A DOCTOR PANTS ON NO THIS IS IT I'VE. I SHOULD TURN IN MY LAWYER CARD IF WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT -- WE WERE ON THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE. WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WE HAVE THE SAME CONCEPTS. AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO CUT OUT THE WORD SMITHING OF IT. I'LL GIVE YOU A HARD EXAMPLE OF THAT IF IT WON'T BE TOO BORING. THE NEW SUBDIVISION AND AS A NANCY THAT WE INCLUDED. WE PUT THAT ACTUALLY IN THE BILL TO SIGN TO EVERYBODY. AS A CONCRETE SIGNED EVERYBODY WE WANT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND IF YOU YOU'LL RECALL THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FOR EXAMPLE I BELIEVE MISTER BACKS. THE SUGGESTION THAT A CONTRIBUTION TO A FOUR OH ONE K. WOULD BE UNLAWFUL UNDER THIS THE REASON I RESPECTFULLY DISPUTE THAT. IS BECAUSE OF THAT WORD CONTINGENT. ADDING BOTH HERE ANDTHERE ARE CERTAINLY IF OF FOUR OH ONE K. CONTRIBUTION WERE ADDED BECAUSE YOU MADE A QUOTA. OR SUBTRACTED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T NEED A QUOTA THAT'S UNLAWFUL NOW. IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET A FOR ALL INCOME CONTRIBUTION FOR DOING A GREAT JOB AT THE END OF THE YEAR LIKE YOUR STAFF DOES A GREAT JOB THE NEW YEAR. THAT'S OKAY SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NEW N. WE PUT CONTINGENT UPON QUOTAS WELL. IN EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE MINUTES OFFERED BY. MISTER BACK WOULD WOULD LIMóN A QUOTE IS FROM THE WHOLE I'M BORED. I CAN TELL SO I THE THE THE POINT IS YES OKAY SO WHAT IT SHOULD BE THIS WE IF IF AS I SAID IF I SHOULD TURN IN MY BARCHART IF I CAN GET OKAY SO SAYS. THAT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE'S OPPORTUNITY GET RESOLUTION I CERTAINLY -- APPRECIABLY FINE ACCOMPLISH APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION EXPRESSES ALSO SUPPORT FOR GETTING TO THE END GOAL HERE -- I KNOW THAT -- I SAID ON THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE ALONG WITH THE CHAIR HE'S SITTING NEXT TO ME SO -- YEAH CERTAINLY I WON WHILE THE CONVERSATION CONTINUE AND SO I GUESS I WOULD MOVE THE BILL AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN PICK UP RESOLVE ALL THE DIFFERENCES.

AS AN EMPLOYER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO -- I'M A LAYOFF TODAY AND IF IT GETS TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WE CAN TAKE A HARDER LOOK AT SOME OF THESE THINGS. SENATE ARCHULETA YES SIR SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE. PERTAIN -- TO YOU KNOW THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT ARE GIVEN AND OR CAN BEEN GIVEN OR HAVE BEEN GIVEN -- CLOSING SOME OF THE LOOPHOLES THAT ARE THERE AND REFERENCE TO KICK BACKS. AND IN IN THE FIRING OF OF THE BAD TEACHERS IN THE BAD ADMINISTRATORS. OF FOR ALLOWING A CODE OF CONDUCT TO IT HE EXIST. OF WITHOUT ANY ONE BE REPRIMANDED WHAT. CAN YOU ANSWER THAT SURE I THAT THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT AT ALL AND WE'RE WILLING TO TO CLARIFY THAT IT'S MORE THE FRIEND IF IT WERE OKAY. FOR MANY PEOPLE FOR NOT DOING THEIR JOB BUT IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO HIRE SOMEBODY AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY THEM BASED UPON HOW MANY THINGS ARE ABLE. TO TO ACHIEVE YOU KNOW.

I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS ATTEMPTING TO DO WHEN YOU'RE TAKING ON A VERY DIFFICULT -- ISSUE AREA AND THIS WHOLE LARGER ISSUE AREA I GUESS MY MY LARGEST CONCERN IS THAT I'VE ALWAYS. BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF K. TWELVE TEACHERS WHEN THE SUBJECT COMES UP ABOUT WHETHER -- TO TIES THEIR WORTHINESS AND THEIR COMPENSATION BASED ON THE SUCCESS OF STUDENTS AT A SCHOOL BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- STUDENTS START AT DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS SOME COME. TO TO SCHOOL READY TO LEARN WHILE OTHERS. DON'T COME TO SCHOOL AS READY TO LEARN AND ALL OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT WE SHOULDN'T -- CRITICIZE IN AND HOLD ITS FAILURES K. TWELVE TEACHERS BECAUSE THE STUDENTS AREN'T ACHIEVING AT THE SAME LEVELS SO I GUESS I'M I'M STRUGGLING WITH. BECAUSE I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE HOLDING THAT SAME STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO TEACHERS WHO ARE WORKINGWITH OTHER STUDENTS WHO. ARE AT HIGHER GRADE LEVEL SO -- THAT'S WHERE I'M STRUGGLING TODAY SOME GOING TO LAY OFF TODAY INTEL -- YOU KNOW I CAN THINK THIS THROUGH MORE AND AND LEARN MORE.

I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR HELPING US WITH PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FROM THIS BILL. I THIS AMENDMENT WOULD LEAVE THE PROVISIONS. OF THE BILL TO BE ENFORCED BY THE STATE'S ATTORNEY'S ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR BY CERTAIN CITY AND COUNTY PROSECUTORS. AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN ISSUING LICENSES AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO OPERATE IN THE STATE. DESPITE SOME SUCCESSES DURING THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF ACT. AND A HALF OF ALL LEGAL SALES THE BLACK MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO FLOURISH DRIVING DOWN LEGAL SALES. RESEARCH AND STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THAT AS MUCH AS 80% OF THE CAMERAS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA. IS DONE VIA THE UNDERGROUND MARKET -- IN ADDITION TO DWINDLING TAX REVENUES THE UNDERGROUND MARKET PRESENTS SERIES PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS TO OUR COMMUNITIES. THE CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOLD AT THESE LOCATIONS DOES NOT NEED ESTABLISH QUALITY STANDARDS AND THE BATES. STATE TESTING COME FOR COMBAT IN THE UNDERGROUND MARKET IS A KEY POLICY GOAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR AS WE WORK TO IMPLEMENT PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR THIS BILL HERE TODAY WILL TARGET THE BLACK MARKET BY CRACKING DOWN ON ANY SPORTS ON A SPECIFIC PROBLEM. THE ADVERTISING OF ILLEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES. CERTAIN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRACTICE OF ADVERTISING ILLEGAL OPERATIONS FOR PROFIT. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN WILL CREATE CIVIL PENALTIES FOR ENTITIES WOULD DECIDE TO ADVERTISING LEGAL OPERATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR PROFIT. AS A AS A LEGISLATURE WE CANNOT SAY THAT WERE TAKING THE CANNABIS BLACK MARKET SERIOUSLY IF WE ALLOW THE UNDERGROUND PROMOTION AN ADVERTISEMENT OF A LEGAL BUSINESSES TO EXIST WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. WE KNOW THAT THESE ADVERTISEMENTS TRIED BUSINESSES TOWARDS HE LEGAL OPERATORS AND MUST FIND A WAY TO RESTRICT THIS PRACTICE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT -- TO RECALL AND HELP THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS LITERACY SKILLS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- I THINK THE POINT TO TELL MR PANETTA MADE OUR THIRTY WE AGREE WITH THEM I WOULD JUST ADD. THAT THE U. OF C. W.'S BEEN INVOLVED WITH -- WITH CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE OUTSET. WE BELIEVE THAT -- IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY IN A GROWING INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY HOWEVER. WE ARE ADVOCATING TO ASSURE THAT. THE JOBS THAT ARE CREATED THROUGH THE INDUSTRY ARE MIDDLE CLASS JOBS WOULD COULD PAIN. WITH GOOD PAYING GOOD WAGES COULD BENEFITS. ALLOW PEOPLE TO MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. THE MARKET CURRENTLY HAS BEEN UNDERCUT BY A LICENSE OPERATORS WHO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES COSTS. THAT OUGHT TO PAY THEY DON'T PAY THE LICENSING FEE THE LOCAL TO THE TESTING THEY DON'T PAY TAXES.

THIRTY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IT'S GOING FORWARD OKAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GEORGE MILLER ON BEHALF OF WEED MAPS AND IN OPPOSITION AB FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN FIRST I WANT TO START WITH. AN APOLOGY FOR MY LETTER OF OPPOSITION WHICH I THOUGHT THAT THE OPERATED PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING OR DISSEMINATING INFORMATION LANGUAGE. I CHARACTERIZE IT AS A BLATANT ATTEMPT BY THE SPONSORS TO MINIMIZE OUR OPPOSITION FROM MANY AND I'VE IT INTERNET. ADVERTISING PLATFORMS ARE CURRENTLY ADVERTISE ON LICENSE CANISTERS RETAILERS. THIS MORNING IN READING THE ANALYSIS APPARENTLY IT WAS A DRAFTING OVERSIGHT THAT APPARENTLY ALL THE ENTITIES. ARE SUPPOSED TO BE INCLUDED IN HERE I THINK I'VE GIVEN MANY OF YOU THIS IS ABOUT NINETY PAGES. OF CANNABIS ADVERTISEMENTS FROM UNLICENSED ENTITIES IN ADDITION TO BEING ON WE'D MAPS THAT ARE ON YELP AND BEING IN YAHOO AND GOOGLE -- IN ANY EVENT IF IT WAS DRAFTING OVERSIGHT I APOLOGIZE. FOR ME MY CALLING IT A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE OPPOSITION. ALSO I THINK THAT IN AN OUNCE IS IT IT DISCUSSES SAW SECTION TWO THIRTY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT -- THIS BILL WILL BE GOING TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY WHERE I THINK THE FOCUS MORE ON THAT BUT ASSUMING JUST FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT. IT DID NOT APPLY I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AT THE BUREAU BEFORE. THE BILL CAN BE MEANINGFULLY -- COMPLIED WITH AND THAT IS. LICENSE LISTINGS -- NEED TO BE. ACCURATE AND HAVE INCLUDED DOING BUSINESS AS CURRENTLY THE BCC ONLY LISTEN NAME OF THE LICENSE HOLDER NOT THE NAME UNDER WHICH THE RETAILERS OPERATING SO OFTEN TIMES. YOU WILL HAVE A LICENSED ENTITY BUT IT'S OUR IT'S HARD TO FIND LICENSE NUMBER BECAUSE YOU'LL BE LOOKING UP UNDER. YOU KNOW A NAME OF A BUSINESS BUT THE LICENSE HOLDER IS -- STEPHEN JOHN -- SO THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED WE'RE ALSO SEEING DELAYS WISHING TO LACE UP TO EIGHTY EIGHT DAYS FROM THE TIME THAT AN ENTITY IS ISSUED A LICENSE. TO THE TIME THAT IT IS ACTUALLY ON THE BUREAU'S WEBSITE -- SO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT. ONLY LICENSE ENTITIES ARE ADVERTISING ON WHETHER IT'S WE'D MAPS CRAIGSLIST YELP GOING THE OPERATE NOW YOU'LL PULL UP A TON OF ADVERTISEMENTS YOU WON'T FIND ANY LICENSE NUMBERS -- IT NEEDS TO BE ACCURATE AND TIMELY. AS WELL AS WELL AS THEY NEED TO HAVE THE ACCURATE ADDRESSES -- THE READER FOR SECOND THOUGHT NOT HAVING THE ACTUAL LOCATION A RETAILER INHIBITS OUR ABILITY TO CROSS REFERENCE FOR LICENSE ACCURACY. SINCE THE PHYSICAL LOCATION ADDRESSES WHAT IS USED TO IDENTIFY THE RETAILER ON PLATFORMS. SO I THINK THERE'S SOME WORKABILITY ISSUES WITH THE BILL -- AGAIN. IN OUR LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HOPEFULLY CLARIFYING THE DRAFTING ERR THAT WAS THE PLACE EARLIER THAT TOM. ONLY CARVED OUT THE NON PRIMARILY WE'D ENTITIES SUCH AS CRAIGSLIST YELP OTHERS FROM THE ADVERTISING HE'S FROM THE DISCLOSURE PEACE BUT NOT THE ADVERTISING PIECE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MILLER ANY OTHER -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION COME TO THE MIKE. BUT SHEPHERD ON BEHALF OF THE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION. MICHELLE KNEW WHEN CALIFORNIA'S PANIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM YOU WERE WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION. ON THE BILL A WE WERE OPPOSED TO ON IT NISHA VERSION OF THE BILL BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- SECTION THREE OF THE BILL WHICH IMPOSES STRICT LIABILITY ON A PUBLISHER. FOR THE INCLUSION OF AN ADVERTISEMENT THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO THAT SECTION. ARM EVEN THE INITIAL LACK THE CREATED THE SCHEMATIC THAT WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW DIDN'T IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THE PUBLISHER FOR AN ADVERTISEMENT THAT FAILED TO ADHERE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW -- IN THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WOULD DO JUST THAT IT WOULD IMPOSE LIABILITY ON A PUBLISHER. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ANOMALY -- WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN GET THERE BUT JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THAT AND WHERE WE ARE IN THIS NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR TURN MEMBERS COURTNEY JOHNSON ON BEHALF OF TECHNOLOGY ONE ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS THE BILL AND LOOK FORWARD. TO FIXING UP ON SOME OF THE ISSUES I'VE BEEN CREATED WITH -- AMENDMENTS CAME EARLIER BUT THINK THAT WE CAN GET THERE YOUR AYE AYE JASON BRYANT'S HUMBY AFTER THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY GROWERS ALLIANCE THE CAMPUS DISTRIBUTIONS ASSOCIATION RUSSIAN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I PLEDGE AS BEING OUT OF ORDER ONE MAKE SURE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE OPEN MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SENATE ARCHULETA YES -- I'D LIKE -- TO CONGRATULATE LITERALLY CONGRATULATE THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THE INDUSTRY NEEDS. A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD I THINK THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE FORTHCOMING AND DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND IF THIS IS GOING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO START THINGS ON THE RIGHT WAY THIS IS YET LICENSING SHOULD BE PUBLICIZED. IF YOU'RE LEGAL -- YOU HAVE THE LICENSE TO DO IT THE LICENSE NUMBER OF PUT IN THE WEBSITE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE HOWEVER THEY ADVERTISED FOR THE CONSUMER TO KNOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH SOMEONE AND I URGE YU -- TO TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL NOT BE WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU AND I'D LOVE TO SEE. A BIG POSTER ON THE DOOR THAT SAYS THIS IS IN A STATUS WITHIN THE LAW. WITHIN THE EMPLOYMENT -- WHAT WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO LEVEL THIS THING OFF? AND SO I SUPPORT YOU FOR DOING THIS AND I KNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT I THINK WE'RE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND I JOB AND I BOTH MY CERTAINLY WAS SUPPORT. GOOD THANK YOU A CENTER PAN. THANK YOU AND FIRST OF ALL SUMMER RUBIO FISHY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS I AM CURIOUS ABOUT THE OPPOSITION FROM I GUESS THE PUBLISHERS AND TECHNET ABOUT -- ABOUT ISSUE ROUND. BUT IT'S SO JUST TO CLARIFY THE BILL HAS CERTAIN CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SOMEONE CAN ADVERTISE IT THE LICENSE NUMBER SOME OTHER THINGS -- SO I GET THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE LIABILITY. FOR PUBLISHING ADVERTISEMENTS THAT DON'T BUT IS THERE AT THE OTHER SO I GUESS MAYBE I CAN ASK THEM TO COME UP. IT'S VIED CLARIFY A SO IS THERE WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE S. IN THIS CONVERSATIONS WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE PANELS PENALTY SO I GUESS A SECURED YOU DON'T WANT LIABILITY FOR THAT IS IS. IS THERE ANOTHER PENALTY IN THE BILL. FOR VIOLATING THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT SO BECOMES LAW IN REGARDS TO THE ADVERTISEMENT ANY. I'M JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY WHAT THE ISSUE IS AROUND SO THERE'S SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY'RE ASKING THAT THERE BE AN ADVERTISING TO SURE THAT THE PERSON ADVERTISING IS. A LEGITIMATE LEGAL. BOB YEAH I GUESS RETAILER WHATEVER WHOSE ADVERTISING SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT -- FOR THE PUBLISHERS -- EIGHTEEN IN TERMS OF WELL IF YOU MEET THE PROVISIONS YOU'RE FINE WRITERS OR ISSUE ROUND THAT. THERE MAY BE -- AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE WASHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT -- RENDON'S JENSEN -- REPRESENTS BUT WITH REGARD TO NEWSPAPERS ARE TWO DIFFERENT. WAYS THAT -- THESE ADVERTISEMENTS CAN APPEAR ON A NEWSPAPER'S WEBSITE TOO PROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING WITH WHICH NEWSPAPER HAS. VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER WHAT GOES INTO THAT SPACE THAT SOLD IT'S ALL DONE BY -- AND ADD EXCHANGE AND I'M BY THE ADVERTISER. AND SO THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUST CRIED SO WE'RE SO THERE'S THE ADS IN WHICH THE NEWSPAPER ACCEPTS AND EITHER PUT SENATE'S PRINT VERSION ARE IN ITS ONLINE VERSION HE'S TALKING TEXTUAL YES RIGHT AND THEN THERE'S THE ADS THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOME CONTRACT WITH SOMEBODY AND THEY THEY'RE JUST STICKING IT OUT I MEAN ANYBODY WHO HAS A WEBSITE THAT ALLOWS THAT'S CORRECT BANNER ADS WHATEVER DOES KIND OF THING SO THE ISSUE JUST WITH THOSE OR IS IT ALSO WITH THE ONES IN WHICH YOU. DIRECTLY CONTROLLED IT'S BOTH -- BECAUSE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR TO IMPOSE LIABILITY ON A PUBLISHER WHO HAS VERY LITTLE CONTROL OVER. THE CONTENT OF THAT AD AND FOR FOR THE TYPE OF AD THAT WAS KNOWN AS A ARE NOT PROBLEMATIC BUT CONTEXTUALIZED SIZING -- PUBLISHERS DON'T. HAVE THE THE TIME TO GO OUT AND FACT CHECKED EVERY SINGLE THING WE RELY ON THE ADVERTISERS TO ENSURE THAT THE ADVERTISEMENT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S OKAY SO SO BASICALLY YOU'RE CONCERNED HERE IS IS THAT IF SOMEONE FALSIFIES INFORMATION BUT YOU YOU WILL DO THE REVIEW AND SAY YOU GOT THE LIGHT YOU MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS CORRECT BUT YEAR JUST CONCERNED THAT. IF THEY FALSIFY INFORMATION NOW YOU'RE LIABLE RIGHT CORRECT SO OKAY [inaudible] SO. AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE OTHER TYPES OF ADVERTISING I GUESS SOMEONE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE IF YOU'RE NOT WHO RECOUNTED SO MAYBE I'LL. BRING BACK THE AUTHORED SPONSORS IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK IS ADDRESSABLE FIX YEAH AND WE WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL THEY WERE IN OPPOSITION. AND AS DISCUSSED AND I'M NOT A AN ONLINE GIRL HOWEVER WHEN YOU DO AN ADVERTISEMENT -- YOU REQUEST CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM THE ADVERTISER INCLUDING SAY A CREDIT CARD NUMBER AND A COMMENT THAT WE DIDN'T COMMITTEE THEN IS IF YOU'RE REQUIRING ALL OF THESE THINGS AND ADD ANOTHER LINE TO REQUIRE THE BUSINESS LICENSE. NOW -- WE WORKED WITH THEM AND GOT THEM OFF THE OPPOSITION AND NOW THEY'RE NEUTRAL -- SOUL WE FELT THAT WE WERE WORKING WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS BY. AND THEN ONLINE WORLD AND EVEN IN THAT -- PRINT WORLD WHEN YOU PRESENT AN ADVERTISEMENT OR CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU ASKED WHAT SIZE AND ALL THAT SO I THINK IT. WOULD BE FAIR TO JUST ADD ANOTHER LINE SAY WHAT IS THE LICENSE NUMBER NOW THE OTHER ISSUES CAN BE DEALT WITH BY. THE FACT THAT THEY SAY THAT IT'S UNFAIR. THAT WERE REQUIRING THEM TO ADD ONE MORE LINE TO SOMETHING IS REALLY NOT AN ARGUMENT IN MY KIDS BECAUSE THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT ENTITIES LIKE THEM ARE WORKING WITH LEGAL FOLKS YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT -- TO ALLOW THE LEGAL MARKET TO SATURATE AND THEM TURN A BLIND EYE EITHER AND SO I THINK THERE'S IN ORDER TO BE BE A RESPONSIBLE ADVERTISER YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE. TALENT IS OUR CHECKS AND BALANCES AND HE STATED THAT THE FOLLOWING THE LAW WILL IF THIS BECOMES LAW THEN THAT'S BE JUST ANOTHER. OB PORTION THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW AND IT TO ME IT DOES NOT SEEM UNREASONABLE -- TO ADD THE LICENSE NUMBER OKAY AND AND A YES. FIVE PERSON HIS GAME PAID FOR THE AD SHOULD BE THE ONE WHO'S LIABLE RIGHT OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL I MEAN THAT THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I URGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE FOLKS WHO HAVE CONCERNS THEIR DEFENSE CLAIMS THAT OUT BUT I OKAY ABSOLUTELY SENATOR -- WHEN WE STARTED -- IN THE ASSEMBLY WE WENT THROUGH A LOT AND WHEN SPECIFICALLY WITH THE PUBLISHERS WERE IN OPPOSITION THEY REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM. ALL RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU THANKS MUCH SO -- I I GUESS I'LL LET ME CALL EVERYONE'S ATTENTION TO THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE SEVEN UNDER PENALTIES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR APPEAL. BECAUSE IN THEIR THE SUGGESTION FROM MY EXCELLENT CONSULTANTS ARE THAT THE AUTHOR SHOULD CONTINUE WORK WITH LICENSING AUTHORITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS. TO INSURE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VIOLATION. BY CONSIDERING THE GRAVITY OF THE VIOLATION. THE GOOD FAITH OF THE LICENSEE OR THE PERSON. THE HISTORY OF PREVIOUS VIOLATIONS AND WHETHER AN APPEAL PROCESS SHOULD BE OUTLINED BASED ON THESE FACTORS. AND YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT YES ABSOLUTELY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN AND AND YOUR STAFF BECAUSE THAT WAS A A POINT OF DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD LAST WEEK TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME FOLKS THAT ARE UNAWARE AND WE WANT TO HONOR THAT AND THEN BUT THEN ONCE THEY KNOW THEN YOU KNOW AND THEN AFTER THAT THEN THE PENALTIES -- DO APPLY AND I THINK IT'S FAIR I IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IF YOU KNOW YOU YOU WERE YOU DID IT NOW THAN YOU DID NOT BUT NOW THIS ASSURES THAT ONCE YOU KNOW IF YOU CONTINUE TO VIOLATE THE LAW WILLINGLY. BECAUSE AT THIS POINT YOU'RE WILLIG -- TO CONTINUE THEN THAT'S WHERE WHERE IT COMES IN AND I AGAIN I WANT TO THINK THAT'S THE STAFF THEY WERE GREAT AND WORKING WITH ME ON THAT PROVISION. IN THE MEDIA ENHANCE THAT THAT OBSERVATION AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR WORK AND CONTINUE YOUR COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN THIS AREA IS THAT. BECAUSE WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION HE REQUIRES A PUBLIC ENTITY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO ENGAGE AND AND ENFORCING THIS AND I THINK THAT IT HAS MY CONFIDENCE THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT FOR A SILLY VIOLATIONS. THAT IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SOMETHING OF SUBSEQUENT AGAINST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES ALL THE TIME. AS TO WHAT THEY AND FORCE AND WE'RE OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AT THE SERIOUS BAD ACTORS HERE IN THIS BILL WELL IN MY HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME OMPANIES THAT ARE. DRIVING THROUGH THIS THE THEY WERE YOU KNOW I SAW THE POSSIBILITIES -- THAT ARE YOU KNOW ALL OF THE JOBS THAT THEY WERE CREATING AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE CREATING AND SO I WAS VERY EXCITED FOR THEM. AND FOR ME FOR AN ORGANIZATION LIKE THAT TO STILL CONDONE THE LEGAL -- ADVERTISERS I FELT THAT THEY WERE RESPONSE WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE AND THEY WANTED TO DO. RIGHT BY THE COMMUNITY RIGHT BY THE WORKERS AND I BELIEVE THEM AND SOLD SOLD THIS. I DON'T THINK IT'S A BIG OF REACH BECAUSE IF THEY WANT TO BE. GOOD STEWARDS OF OF OF THEIR THIS NEW -- BUSINESS AND THEY WERE GOING TO COMPLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY STILL WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVERTISE. TO GET THE ADVERTISEMENT DOLLARS FROM LEGAL -- BUSINESSES AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL I'M NOT TRYING TO SHUT ANYBODY DOWN DOWN. I VOTED ON PROP SIXTY FOUR WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I WAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS GOING TO RECEIVE ALL OF THESE TAX -- TAX MONIES MY SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE IT AND SO FOR ME IT'S JUST GOING -- MAKING SURE THAT BUT LEGAL. SOMEHOW. IN HOPEFULLY THROUGH THIS BILL START ON UNDERSTANDING THAT DID THAT WE'RE SERIOUS AND THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE THE THE RESIDENTS PASSED THIS PROPOSITION SO THAT WE CAN SEE THE BENEFIT OF OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY SO WITH THAT I THINK I CAN USE THAT IS NOT LIKELY THAT IS A CLOSE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE GRAY AND AND THEN THE JUST SAY -- THAT I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME ANGST BY. SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT THEY ENGAGE IN THESE PLATFORMS. BUT I I DON'T UNDER MY READING OF THIS BILL AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO TRY -- TO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DO PICKY LITTLE THINGS WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER SERIOUS ABUSE AND THIS IS IN A SPACE OF GREAT SERIOUSNESS TO OUR STATE. THIS LEGALIZATION ISSUE THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN I GET THAT -- TO BUT WE HAVEN'T CURTAIL THE ILLEGAL USE. OF CANNABIS IN OUR STATE AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITY AND THERE'S LOTS OF PROBLEMS -- AND THIS IS ONLY GOING AFTER A PART OF THE ISSUE AND WE HAVE MUCH MORE WORK TO DO -- AND AND AND OUT BUT I APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS GOOD WORK. I THINK THAT YOU'VE TRIED TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE I THINK YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THIS BILL. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO TRY -- TO NOT DO ANYTHING IN IT BURDEN HERE WE REALLY HAVE TO GIVE A CLEAR AT TARGET IN MIND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT. ONE THANK YOU WITHOUT LOOKING FOR A MOTION WE HAVE A MOTION CENTER ARCHULETA. ON THE BILL WITH THAT SECRETARY WOULD CALL THE ROLL. MISSION IS TO PASS THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE CHIANG ARCHULETA. OUR TO LET AYE DODD. DODD AYE GALGIANI. HILL. HILL I'D LEYVA. SORRY I BY. HAND. AND I WELL [inaudible] OKAY. RIGHT THAT BILL CURRENTLY ENJOYS THE ENOUGH SUPPORT TO GET APPLE WILL HOLD ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP FIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW THIS IS -- ITEM ONE IN YOUR AGENDA. THE BILL. FIVE TWENTY EIGHT WELCOME. SURE IF IF I MIGHT -- WOULD YOU CONSIDER THE UP ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT FIRE BIG SIZE AND FOR EACH OF THE OTHER. EXPERT WITNESSES WHO MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE. OKAY MIGHT THAT BE POSSIBLE RIGHT -- WILL WITH THE COMMITTEES ACCEPTANCE OF THAT WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER. FOUR ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AGAIN WOULD APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS A BILL TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE HAVE NON PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS BEING PROVIDED TO ADD TO ADDRESS IN. TACKLE THIS OF YOUR CRISIS -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TACKLE THIS MAJOR ISSUE AND WITH RESPECT AS RIVAL CAN HAVE. OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY THEIR WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS A DAVID BENEVENTO MY DOCTOR OF CHIROPRACTIC. I PRACTICED IN FOLSOM CALIFORNIA BEEN THERE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE I'M ALSO PAST PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA CARE PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION IN 200-018-0009. SO THANK YOU FOR LET ME TESTIFYING. NON FICTIONAL CITY CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO HAVE A FIXABLE OVER YOUR PROBLEM. THAT IS STILL KILLING HUNDREDS AND MORE LIKELY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EACH YEAR. FOR THE LAST OFFICIAL DATA WE HAVE IS FROM. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT PUTS THE NUMBER OF DEATHS IN ALMOST TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THAT YEAR. IT IS NOT JUST THOSE DEATHS BUT THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND FAMILIES THAT HIM. HAVE BEEN RUINED. IT IS ALSO ALL THE CHILDREN HAVE LOST A PARENT AS WELL AS A AS FOR THE PAIN DISABILITY AND FINANCE RUINED BECAUSE OF THOSE WHO AVOIDED DEATH BUT NOT THE ADDICTION. WITH A. B. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WE ARE ASKING YOU TO WORK TO HELP STOP FEELING THE FINAL OF PEOPLE BEING GIVEN PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ARE THE FOUNDATION OF THIS PROBLEM. YOUR SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WELL FIRST WILL FACILITATE A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO HELP AND DO THIS PROBLEM THROUGH A MECHANISM THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THAT MECHANISM IS FULL WRITTEN AND VERBAL INFORMED CONSENT. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH. AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT WERE REQUIRED TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE FIFTH TOURISTS OF OPIOIDS TO THE PATIENT. THROUGH A DISCUSSION AND A SIGNED CONSENT SO THAT PATIENTS CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. AS A CHIROPRACTOR WE WE ALL WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE INFORMED CONSENT BEFORE. DO THE MANIPULATED PROCEDURE ON A PATIENT IN FACT I JUST HAD A PATIENT THIS MORNING. A FIREMAN THAT AND WORKED UP AND BEFORE I DID THE MANIPULATION WENT OVER THE YOU KNOW THE PROS AND CONS OF MANIPULATION. AND TOOK LESS THAN A MINUTE IT DOESN'T REALLY TAKE A LOT OF TIME BUT IT IS IMPORTANT. ALSO INFORMED CONSENT IS ALL ABOUT WITH THE ADDED RISK WHAT WE CONSIDERED A HERE AT RISK. AND I THINK WE HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT OPIOIDS CAUSING DEATH WOULD BE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INHERENT RISK. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS BIG RISK HERE. AND THAT PEOPLE WITH OVER WHAT'S GOING ON AB EIGHT EIGHT OH ALSO PUT IN PLACE A REQUIREMENT. THAT PRESCRIBERS INFORM PATIENTS THAT EVIDENCE BASED ALTERNATIVES TO OPIOIDS EXIST INCLUDING LICENSE NON FARM ARTICLE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. WHAT THE RESEARCHERS TOLD US OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT FOR PAIN OPIATES ARE GENERALLY NOT RECOMMENDED? AND THE NON FORMAL. LOGICAL PROVIDERS MENTION IN THE BILL MOST DEFINITELY ARE. THERE IS NO MANDATE TO FORCE A PRESCRIBER TO PICK ANY SPECIFIC PROVIDER OR TO MAKE A DIRECT REFERRAL ONLY TO ALERT THE PATIENT ABOUT SEVERAL EVIDENCE BASED CLASSES OF PROVIDERS THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. SO IN SUMMARY WE ARE ASKING YOU TO HAVE. REQUIRED DOCUMENT THAT PATIENTS UNDERSTAND WITH THE PRESCRIBER UNDERSTANDS WHEN THEY'RE BE GIVEN AN OPIOID. THEN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU THAT NEXT WITNESS JENNIFER SUMMERS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE MEDICAL BORDERS IN SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE PRESCRIBERS TO DISCUSS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPIOIDS OF ALL PATIENTS. NOT JUST MINOR PATIENTS IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT MUST BE INCLUDING THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS WHICH WILL HELP THE BOARD TO FORCES BILLS REQUIREMENTS. THE GROWING OPIOID ABUSE EPIDEMIC REMAINS A MATTER CONCERN FOR THE BOARD. THIS BILL INCREASE EDUCATION FOR ALL PATIENTS WHICH WILL FOR THE BOARD'S MISSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THE POOREST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OKAY THANK YOU VERY GOOD THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT YES. TOM RENT FREE ARM DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES WITH THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND WERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. STEVE KERR TOLD A REPRESENTING THE INDEPENDENT PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANDREA MCMILLAN REPRESENTING THE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFITT ON THE HAVE MEDTRONIC I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AN IN BETWEEN YEARS NOW OR LATER. YOU'RE AT THE MICRO I'M HERE. MEDTRONIC IS SUPPORT IF AMENDED -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL IF IT'S GONNA INCLUDE THERAPY SHOULD INCLUDE ALL THERAPIES INCLUDING IMPLANTABLE DEVICES WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED THE BILL. ONLY SUGGESTION WE WOULD MAKE IS THAT IT BE CHANGED FROM NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TO NON OPIOIDS BECAUSE THERE ARE. SOME FORMAL PHARMACOLOGICAL WITH IMPLANTABLE DEVICES THAT DELIVERS A LITTLE BIT OF MEDICINE EXACTLY WHERE IT'S NEEDED. WHICH IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OPIOIDS AS WELL SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING WHATEVER IT IS NOW I'VE BEEN ALL TOMORROW ON BEHALF OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOU CAN CLEAR I GUESS I ONE MORE SPACE TO BE GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. I'M WE'RE IN IMPOSING WAS AMENDED AB POSITION ON THE BILL WE WANT TO THINK THAT COMMITTEE FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. AND FOR THE AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS. I AM. WITHOUT THOSE WE HAVE MOLD MAJOR CONCERNS ON THE BILL AND EVEN WITH THOSE THEY'RE STILL A COUPLE OF CONCERNS LEFT THAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS. I AM TWO PIECES IN THE BILL THE REMAINING BECAUSE OF CONCERN TO OUR MEMBERS. THESE A REQUIREMENT THE PRESCRIBERS DISCUSS NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR PAIN REGARDLESS OF THEIR APPROPRIATENESS TO THE PATIENT AND THE LANGUAGE THE DRUG% PRESCRIBER STOP FOR A REFERRAL TO A NON FARM TREATMENT FOR PAIN IF APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH CHIROPRACTIC TREATMENT ACUPUNCTURE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT AREN'T APPROPRIATE FOR PATIENTS SUCH AS AFTER MINOR SURGERY WHICH LEAVES A PATIENT AND SHORT TERM ACUTE PAIN. IN THESE CASES THESE NON FARM TREATMENTS WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE AS THEY SERVE A GREATER PURPOSE FOR CHRONIC PAIN A RECURRENT EPISODES OF PAIN. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE OPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR APPROPRIATENESS AND WITHOUT EVIDENTIARY SUPPORT TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS PRESCRIBERS TO OFFER A REFERRAL IF APPROPRIATE WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE DISCRETION. BEING LEFT TO THE PROVIDER THE WORD REFERRAL IS LARGELY PROBLEM LARGELY PROBLEMATIC AS A REFERRAL IS SOMETHING THAT SPECIFIES A PROVIDER. AND SIGNIFIES INSURANCE COVERAGE OF THE FOR TREATMENT. WITH MANY OF THE SERVICE IS NOT BEING COVERED BY INSURANCE OUR REFERRAL WILL PROVIDE A FALSE RELIANCE ON THE SERVICE BEING COVERED ONLY FOR THE PATIENT TO FIND OUT THAT THEIR INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER THE SERVICE AT ALL. OR HAS ITS OWN LIMITS ON COVERAGE WHICH ARE COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED BY A REFERRAL. WE WOULD ASK THAT THE WORD REFERRAL BE STRUCK FROM THE BILL AND THE MANDATORY DISCUSSION OF THESE OPTIONS BE CHANGE TO OCCUR AS APPROPRIATE TO THE PATIENT. WE WOULD ALSO A HIGHLY DISAGREE WITH THE PROVISION THAT REQUIRES AND WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT IN THE BILL INFORMED CONSENT IS A COMPLETELY NEW LEGAL STANDARD. ON THE DISCUSSION THE BILL WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH WE SUPPORTED IT LAST YEAR AND A SIMILAR BILL FOR MINORS WE WOULD TAKE COURAGE. EXTENDING THAT TO ADULTS THIS YEAR THE PROBLEM WITH CALLING IN INFORMED CONSENT IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE YOU SAY SIGNIFYING THAT YOU ARE TAKING ON ALL OF THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF THIS MEDICATION BUT YOU ARE SIGNING THAT YOU DO THAT JUST AS YOU WOULD BEFORE SURGERY -- THIS LEGAL STANDARD WE DON'T BELIEVE IS APPROPRIATE AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THE PROVISION ALSO BE STRUCK. AS IN THE AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT'S WHEN THIS. INTERNET OFF RESIDENTS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN STRYCHNINE. IN BREVITY. I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I GUESS JUST TO REITERATE. HER POINTS REGARDING THE DISCUSSION I THINK YOU HAVE A PRESCRIBER PARTY'S POSITION ARE A DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD OF CARE. AND THEN WITHIN AFTER -- THEY TOOK TOMORROW WHAT PROPER CARE IS FOR THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT THEY WOULD THEN NEED. TO DISCUSS SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE RETURNING WITH MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PATIENT'S CONDITION AND SO WE ASK OUR DISCUSSION BE DELETED AS WELL AS THE REFERRAL OPTION AS WELL AND WE APPRECIATE THE AND THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND WHAT HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR. ACCEPT THOSE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE OTHER WAY. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WE CANNOT THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER TWO PARTIES IN OPPOSITION -- ARE WE WOULD AS SEEK THE MOMENTS THAT WERE SUBMITTED BY COMMITTEE I'M A SPECIFICALLY FOR DENNIS WE WOULD SEE THAT -- IT'S NOT ALWAYS A APPROPRIATE IN MOST CASES NOT FOR DENTISTS -- ESPECIALLY FOR ORAL SURGERY OR STRESS EXTRACTION OF WISDOM TEETH NON PHARMACOLOGICAL ALTERNATIVES WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE SO IN -- ALSO SEEK TO HAVE THOSE MOMENTS TAKEN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MATT ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF KAISER PERMANENTE SAY -- DEFINITELY THINK THE COMMITTEE ON STAFF ON THE ANALYSIS WE TO AGREE WITH THE SUGGESTIONS IN THERE WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED NOW SAYS -- LIKE THE OTHERS SPEAKERS AS WELL I THINK WE HAVE -- WOOD IF THIS BILL DOES GET OUT OF COMMITTEE I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEEK WORKING ON THAT MANDATED REFERRAL -- WE THINK YOU KNOW THE SHOULD BE A CASE BY CASE BASIS ON WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE. I TO BE DISCUSSING THE TREATMENTS BUT WITH OUR STONE OPPOSE UNLESS THE DECISION THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARTS SCENE NOW WILL BE THE BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COULD YOU ADDRESS THE OF THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS. YES IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IT IS TO EXTRACT THAT OF THE WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE THAT'S ONE OF THEM YES YES IT'S AND THEN THE THE OTHER -- ONE IT'S ABOUT -- THIS -- CHANGING YOUR SPECIFIC -- NON PHARMACY. NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS OF FROM THAT. SPECIFIC TO A GENERIC -- THAT'S ON PAGE THIRTY YES YES SO. AS I UNDERSTAND FROM THAT THE RECOMMENDED. A MAN'S OF THOSE TWO FUNCTIONS ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO RING INFORMED CONSENT AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM. OUR DOCTOR OF CHIROPRACTIC CARE -- THAT IS ALREADY PRACTICED AND TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THIS POLICY. IS THE DIRECTION WE LIKE TO HEADED WITH RESPECT TO THE INFORMED CONSENT IN OTHER WORDS TO MAINTAIN THAT SO THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT OTHERWISE. THERE'S NO TEETH IN THIS THE WHOLE NOTION OF THE IMPETUS FOR THIS IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO CURE CRISIS AND THAT WE SHOULD HAVE. ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS PRIOR TO PRESCRIBING THAT THAT -- GOOD SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT EVERITT INFORMED CONSENT PROVIDES THAT TEETH IN A MECHANISM TO OF GET THAT ENFORCEMENT THE OTHER THING YEAH THE SECOND COMPONENT WAS IT WAS ON THE REFERENCES OF THE VARIOUS -- THERAPIES ACUPUNCTURE CHIROPRACTIC CARE PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THAT CORRECT. THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO A STRIKING. OUT. HI BUT BUT THAT BUT AS PRESENTED TO IT IS NOT LIMITED TO SO THOSE ARE A NUMBER OF VARIOUS OPTIONS AND I THINK THAT'S IN FACT THE INTENT. AND I THINK YOU MAY HAVE SHARED WITH ME THAT YOU HAD SOME CONCERN ABOUT NARROWING SUCH A DEFINITIVE -- SEGMENT BUT RATHER I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE INTENT TO HELP. DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THERAPIES THAT EXIST. TO COUNTER THIS OF YOUR CRISIS SO IT IS NOT LIMITED -- TO THESE VARIOUS THERAPIES -- SO THAT'S OF THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATION -- BUT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF THIS OKAY SO THE A BIRD THAT THE BILL AS AS AS AS IT'S PRESENTED YES OKAY VERY GOOD. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU AND SUMMER LIVE FREE SHEET THE YOUR EFFORT TO TRY TO ADDRESS -- THE OVER USE OF OPIOIDS I GUESS MY CONCERN AND I AND I HOPE THAT YOU DO TAKE THE AND THEN IT'S SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. IS THAT CERTAINLY WELL WE CAN TALK ABOUT VARIOUS DIFFERENT OPTIONS. WELL THIS WAS A NOT ALL PAIN IS THE SAME -- ONE CAN EVEN ARGUE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS FOCUSED ON NON PHARMACOLOGICAL -- THERE ARE MANY OTHER PHARMACOLOGICAL. TREATMENTS FOR PAIN ASIDE FROM OPIOIDS AND IN FACT -- MAY CONVERSATIONS IS THAT -- WE SHOULD PERHAPS BE USING THOSE INSTEAD -- CERTAINLY I THINK YELL NON PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS ARE HELPFUL BUT PROVIDING A I MEAN WHAT AM ZERO PATIENT HAVE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF PAIN WE HEARD FROM THE DENTIST RIGHT I MEAN YOU MIGHT HEAD OF WISDOM TOOTH TAKEN OUT YOU COULD HAVE PAIN FROM. YOUR BACK PAIN WHERE -- WHERE SOMETHING NAY BUT YOU MAY HAVE PAIN POST SURGICAL YOU HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF PAIN AND JUST GIVING EVERYONE A LIST OF? DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MAY NOT US WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE PAIN THAT THEY HALF BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE SEEING A PATIENT WHERE. THEY'RE NOT SAYING OH I JUST HAVE PAIN THEY HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC FORM OPINION MAY HAVE HEADACHE THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE THEY MAY HAVE POST SURGICAL PAIN ETCETERA. AND NOT ALL THESE NECESSARILY APPLY FOR EXAMPLE PHYSICAL THERAPY CAN BE SOMETHING VERY GOOD FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. ALRIGHT BUT IF THAT'S NOT MUSCO SKELETAL WHERE WE BRING IT UP I MEAN THAT CONFUSES PATIENTS PATIENTS ARE LIKE I MEAN THEY WHAT. THAT'S WHY THEY WANT TAILORED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THEIR STICKLER SITUATION AND I AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT -- I FIND THAT PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS NOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE'RE GONNA POSED BY LAW WE TO TELL DOCTORS WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY. AND THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY GO OUT AND TELL. GIVE PATIENTS OPTIONS THAT THEY DON'T FEEL ARE ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THEM GIVEN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION AROUND OTHER AREAS AS WELL -- RANGING FROM YOU KNOW SO NO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH TO OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AND I THINK WE JUST GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT -- NOT. TELLING DOCTORS TO FORCE THEM TO SAY THINGS THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PATIENTS. AND ARDEN IS AN APPROPRIATE FOR PATIENTS PATIENTS SO IT'S ONLY THERE ARE PARTICULAR ROLES FOR DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE THINGS -- FOR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS BUT TO HAVE THEM REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST. EVEN IF IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE PAGE I THINK THIS CREATES CONFUSION AND AND CAN BE MISLEADING FOR PATIENTS AND SO -- I IT'S EIGHT YEAH I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT EIGHT AND THEN THE NEXT STEP IS REFERRAL AND AGAIN WE HEARD SOME ISSUES ABOUT THAT BUT I JUST WANT. TO RAISE THAT CAUTION APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTING THAT WE REMOVE THAT SORT OF SPECIFICITY BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN. THAT'S WHY YOU GO TO HEALTH OFFICIALS WILL GO TO BY THE WAY A PHYSICIAN OR GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR WE GO TO THE AT ALL A NURSE PRACTITIONER OR PA OR ANY OTHER OUR LICENSE PROFESSIONALS ARE PHYSICAL THERAPIST. WE WE EXPECT THEM TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS BASED ON PROFESSIONAL STANDARD OF CARE THAT ARE TAILORED TO THE PATIENT THAT YOU'RE SAYING [inaudible] THANK YOU. HE CENTER PAN CENTER ARCHULETA YES A QUESTION FOR DR -- YOU SAID YOU HAD SEEN A PATIENT FIREFIGHTER THIS MORNING. AND AFTER YOU YOU DISCUSS. BUT YOU WERE GOING TO AND SO ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED ANYTHING YES YOU DID YES IT'S REQUEST BOTH WRITTEN AND ORAL CONSENT WRITTEN IN AN ORAL SO YOU DISCUSSED A RISK AND HE RECEIVED A PAMPHLET THAT I'M SORT SIGNED FOR IT. YES WE HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT LIST ALL THE PROCEDURES AND DISCUSS WITH THEM WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH THEM AND HE SIGNED OFF AND I WENT AHEAD AND TREATED HIM YES. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THERE THAT -- THAT'S A REQUIREMENT THE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC. OF MADE UP OF YOUR PROFESSIONALS HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO REQUIRE THAT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE ENACTED IS THAT RIGHT. I BELIEVE SO CORRECT OKAY SO ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OTHER PRESCRIPTION. DRUG THAT REQUIRES THIS TYPE OF INFORMED WRITTEN CONSENT. IN AND ANY ANYTHING THAT WE DO. AND NOT ON A DRUG LEVEL OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME WE WOULD EVER APPLY THAT TO A DRUG CORRECT. AND THE CASE OF YOUR INFORMED CONSENT IT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT WASN'T PUT ON YOU BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE WAS PUT ON BY YOUR BOARD WITH YOUR PEERS SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS REQUIREMENTS CORRECT. OKAY VERY GOOD OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WELL THE FUTURE IF I COULD IDEA. YOU KNOW I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE I ACTUALLY GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR IN SACRAMENTO -- THAT DOES THAT IS JOB RELIEVES THE PAIN AND I CHOSE THAT OF COURSE BECAUSE I DID NOT WANT THE GOING THE OTHER DIRECTION -- TAKING THE THE CHANCE OF NOT. BY I'D LOOK FOR A SOLUTION AND I THOUGHT I COULD FIND A SOLUTION THERE RATHER THAN THAN GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION BUT I I IS A LOOK AT THE BILL AND THAT IS A LOOK AT THE THE REQUIREMENTS. THAT ARE NECESSARY -- SEEM TO GO TOO FAR AND I THINK SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS REALLY GOING TO BRING IT INTO SOMETHING I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE -- SHOULD KNOW OF ALTERNATIVES THEY SHOULD BE AWARE OF ALTERNATIVES BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THAT THE PLACE FOR THAT DOCTOR. TO TO GO THAT FAR WITH REFERRALS WITH THE THE CONSENT NECESSARY. TO THAT WE WILL MAKE OUR MEDICAL CHOICES -- IN THE MANNER IN WHICH WE WE DO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN CERTAIN APPROACHES TO THAT -- I THINK CERTAINLY ALLOWING AND AND EDUCATING THE THE PATIENT IS IMPORTANT -- AND THE PATIENT SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT BUT I DON'T I I JUST THINK THIS IS MORE OF A OF A BURDEN RATHER THAN. THE SOLVING OF A PARTICULAR PROBLEM THAT THAT MAYBE THAT WE ALL BELIEVE IN -- EXIST TODAY SO -- THAT'S THE CONCERN I HAVE I JUST THINK IT'S JUST TAKES A LITTLE BEYOND WHERE I'M COMFORTABLE GOING. THANK YOU SENATOR HIM. LET ME HEAR. JUST ALONG PLEASE -- LET LET ME SAY -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AYE AYE APPROVED MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP -- AND AND YOUR CONCERN IN THIS AREA OF OPIOIDS IT'S A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT -- YOU HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN TRYING TO CREATE A MUCH BETTER CIRCUMSTANCE AWARENESS -- ON SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS A BIG PROBLEM AND I THINK THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS BILL. IN TERMS OF EXPANDING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PRESCRIBERS TO DISCUSS THE RISKS AND DANGERS -- TO ALL PATIENTS WE DID THAT FOR MINORS. YEAH YOUR EFFORT YOUR GOAL IN THIS BILL TO EXTEND THAT TO ALL PATIENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I HEARTILY AGREE WITH. AND I THINK IT'S IT'S WHAT MAKES THAT PART OF THE BILL SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING I THINK FOR US TO ADVANCE THIS YEAR -- I ALSO THINK THAT -- IN ENCOURAGING -- PRESCRIBERS TO TO TALK ABOUT NON PHARMACY AT PHARMACOLOGICAL ALWAYS HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT WERE TREATMENTS. IS ALSO A VERY HEALTHY THING TO DO -- BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO TO DEAL WITH PAIN SENATOR HILL WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS CHIROPRACTOR I ALSO GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR. AND I FIND THAT TREATMENT TO HAVE BEEN VERY VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ME BUT THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER -- TREATMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT THAT THAT MAY BE MORE APPLICABLE TO THE DISCOMFORT OR PAIN THAT THAT PERSON IS EXPERIENCING. AND SO I ALSO FIND THAT PART OF YOUR BILL TO BE VERY POSITIVE AND VERY ENCOURAGING. WHERE I DIFFER I THINK FROM THE DIRECTION THE BILL? IS A IS IN THESE AREAS A LOT OF INFORMED CONSENTS NOT SOMETHING WE'VE EVER REQUIRED -- FOR A PRESCRIPTION THAT I'M AWARE OF AND I ALSO THINK THAT BEING SO SPECIFIC ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVES. I THINK GOES FARTHER THAN I THINK -- THAT WE SHOULD BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD BE RELYING UPON THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR POSITIONS. THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE TREATMENT TO TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW AND WHAT THEY THEY TALK ABOUT THAT. AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT BEAT BY BEING MORE SPECIFIC I THINK IT TAKES AWAY FROM -- AT A TAKING DVANTAGE OF THE PROFESSIONALISM THAT WE EXPECT FROM THOSE. FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THAT EXAMINATION. SO HERE YOU HAVE A CASE OF THE YOUR BILL -- ADVANCING SO VERY MERITORIOUS ALIMENTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ENACTED. BUT I THINK IT DOES GO A LITTLE FURTHER THAN I THINK IT IT SHOULD IN THESE OTHER AREAS. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERN ON THE ISSUE OF REFERRALS. HOWEVER -- MY THOUGHT THERE WAS THAT -- IF THIS BILL DOES MOVE FOR THE THIRD BE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- TO TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND. BETTER COMMON GROUND BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT PREPARED TO MOVE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM WITHOUT THOSE TWO SUGGESTED A MAN SO. WHEN TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AND GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANY ANY CLOSING COMMENTS YOU WANT TO MAKE? YES SEVEN I THINK WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ALREADY WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THESE ISSUES I THINK YOU OUTLINED IT QUITE WELL THAT FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT -- AS AS I PRESENTED THIS BILL WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIOUS. OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT NOT LIMITED TO SO WHEN WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT NARROWING. IT'S NOT LIMITED TO SOME OF THESE. KIND OF TYPE OF TREATMENTS I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY THE INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO BECAUSE WE WANT TO TACKLE THIS IN A VERY COURAGEOUS FASHION AND EVEN IF IT'S NOT DONE BEEN DONE BEFORE. BECAUSE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING AND SO I SHARE THAT COMMITMENT THAT YOU HAVE ALSO IN TACKLING THIS OPIOID CRISIS -- AND HOPE THAT -- YOU SHOULD THIS BILL NOT MOVE FOR THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY ON THESE VARIOUS ISSUES BUT I JUST THINK. WE NEED SOME TEETH TO THIS AND TO ALLOW FOR MANY OF THESE DIFFERENT MODALITIES TO CONTINUE TO BE. UTILIZED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND TACKLING THIS ISSUE SO. THANK YOU AND I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES AND AGAIN I'D I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND AND CONCERN IN A VERY IMPORTANT AREA -- AND I HAD I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING WHETHER WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THIS OR SOMETHING FURTHER IN THIS AREA I LOOK FOR TO WORKING ON IT TOGETHER WITH YOU. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL THAT'S THAT COMPLETES OUR TESTIMONY MEMBERS IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS ISSUE. ALRIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE BILL FOR NOW AND AGAIN OUR THANKS FOR BRINGING THE ISSUE FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE BILL -- NEXT WELL IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU WITH START AT THE TOP ITEM ONE AB. FIVE TWENTY EIGHT FIVE TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER AT CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS REGARDING THE ROOM MOVING UP PROVISIONS REGARDING WORKERS COMPENSATION AT THIS BILL HELPS TO ENSURE THAT THE REPORTING. IS FROM SEVENTY TWO ONE WORKING DAY TO WHICH WE KNOW THAT ALREADY IS IN EXISTENCE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN FAVOR. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION I'M AB IN SUPPORT AB FIVE TWENTY EIGHT CONTAINS CRITICAL FIXES TO THE MANDATORY CHECK REQUIREMENTS FOR THE POSITIONS OF THE CARE SYSTEM. HE FIXES ENSURE THE POSITIONS A PULL AVOID DUPLICATE OF WORK ALLOW FOR DELEGATES ACTUALLY PULL PATIENT RECORDS OR VIEW IT. YOU'RE THE VIEW THE CURES REPORT WHEN IT APPEARS IN FRONT OF THEM IN AN INTEGRATED EHR SYSTEM. AND REMOVES OWNERS ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT DON'T SRVE TO PROTECT PATIENTS BUT I'D TIME TO APPOINTMENTS AND OVERALL COST THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH PROTECT ACCESS SECURES AND PREVENT INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM UTILIZING THIS PROVIDER DATE ASSEMBLY TO DENY PATIENT CLAIMS. I THINK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ASK FOR SUPPORT ON AB. FIVE TWENTY WEST GERMAN MEMBERS JOHN NOR WOULD I BE ALPHA ZENITH INSURANCE COMPANY -- I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WANT TO POINT OUT BECAUSE I THINK. THE ANALYSIS AND I CURRENTLY -- INDICATES A REASON WHY YOU WOULD I HAVE WORKERS COMPENSATION SURE IS INVOLVED IN THIS. EMPLOYER. AND THUS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURER IS RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR THE INJURY THE WORKERS COMP INJURY BUT ALSO FOR FOR THE EFFECTS OF THE INJURY THAT MEANS ANY WITH THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL CARE HE TYPES OF ADDICTIONS. AN ACCIDENT ON THE WAY HE YOU KNOW TO A MEDICAL CARE ARE BACK SO THAT.

OVERBOARD STUFF DOES HAVE SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS WITH THE AMENDMENTS BUT THE BOARD LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE AND STAKEHOLDERS ASSESSMENT BILL MOVES TO THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND NOT IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. BACK A CREAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS TAKEN CAN COMMITTEE THIS MORNING THAT. REMOVES SOME OF OUR CONCERNS OTHER WE NOTE THAT IT STILL LEAVES A ROLLING BACK OF THE REGULATION DEADLINE BY ONE YEAR EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO WHAT NEED TO BE IN THE REGULATIONS. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PUSHING BACK THE REGULATIONS ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ADDING NEW PRESCRIPTIONS TO THE KERRS AT BASS. AND EXTENDING THE WHAT I WAS CAPTURED IN IT WHILE THE CARES EITHER BASE REMAINS -- WITHOUT CRUCIAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS I THINK IF YOU ASK ANY CALIFORNIAN ON THE STREET IF THEIR PRESCRIPTION RECORDS ARE ANY DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THEIR OTHER MEDICAL RECORDS. THEY WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY ARE THE SAME AND TREATED WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF PRIVACY PROTECTIONS HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT. AND THE CARES ADDED BASS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC IN THAT IT IS I'M NOT ONLY SHARING THESE -- PRIVATE AND RECORDS WITH -- I'M A BACK UP AND FORGET THAT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC THAT OUR PRIVACY OUR PRIVATE RECORDS ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER CURRENT THAT THE DOJ GUIDELINES. SOMEONE IF THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS RECORDS LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY NEED A WARRANT BUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET ALL THE RECORDS OF ALL OF THE DOCTORS PATIENTS THEY INCLUDE THESE PRIVATE. THE PATIENT INFORMATION ALONG WITH THE PRESCRIPTION THE DOCTOR -- PROVIDED THEY DO NOT NEED A WARRANT WHICH SEEMS A LITTLE ODD FIT FOR ONE PERSON'S RECORDS YOU GET. A WARRANT BUT TO GET A VAST NUMBER OF PATIENT RECORDS THROUGH THE DOCTOR REPORT YOU DO NOT NEED A WARRANT AND SO WE ASK THAT UNTIL. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR CARE IS THAT WE DO NOT EXTEND IT TO TO SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS. PARTICULARLY AS THE AUTHOR STATEMENT AS LISTED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS STATES THAT THE REASON FOR ADDING AND THESE SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS IS BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH. COUGH SYRUP WITH OPIOIDS IN THEM THAT HAS BEEN. THAT HAS BALLOONED OUT FOR HER -- BEING COMING POPULARIZED AND THE POP CULTURE AND SO WE WONDER ABOUT THE NEED. TO EXPOSE. OTHER PATIENTS NON OPIOID SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS TO REDUCE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN ORDER TO FIGHT SOMETHING THAT IS NOT COMING FAST A FAIRLY FROM FIRST RESULTING FROM PRESCRIPTIONS BUT FROM POP CULTURE. AND SO WITH RESPECTFULLY REMAIN OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. VERY GOOD -- OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY SEEN NINE WILL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CENTER PAN AND SENATOR GALGIANI. SEVEN FOR FIRST OF ALL -- A MARYLAND. NO I I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- AND I KNOW THAT -- YOUR EFFORTS HERE IS TO TRY TO YOU KNOW APPROVED SECURES DATABASE I DO SHARE SOME THE CONCERNS OF THE ACLU -- IN REGARDS TO PRIVACY ISSUES THIS. IS A DATABASE THAT'S IN THE DOJ SO IT'S NOT NOT HEALTHCARE ENTITY SO IT'S AS I THINK WE NEED TO CLARIFY THE THE THE NATURE OF OUR OUR YOU KNOW BUT OUR STATE FEDERAL PRIVACY LAWS HOW TO PLACE TO THIS AND I ALSO REMIND -- IN A DO YOU KNOW THIS BUT JUSTREMIND YOU FOR LISTENING TO THIS IS IS THAT -- OFTENTIMES WE TALK ABOUT PICTURES AND AND CONTROLS OF THIS IS ABOUT THE X. OPIOIDS BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDICATIONS ARE NOT OPIOIDS. THAT ARE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. ALL RIGHT. AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW I I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE KIDS WITH ADHD. THOSE -- STIMULANTS ARE. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES REASON A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE SOME OF AN ADDICTION POTENTIAL RIGHT AND SO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT ARE -- ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SCHEDULE -- FIVE THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS TO HAVE CODEINE -- THAT'S THE MAIN SUBSTANCE THAT'S IN THERE BUT ACTUALLY THERE ARE OTHER MEDICATIONS THEIR SCHEDULE FIVE HAD OR NOT THERE ARE NONE OF MORE -- TOO LATE OKAY -- SO THOSE ARE IN THERE AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW -- RECOGNIZE -- YOU KNOW WHY YOU WANT TO INCLUDE NAY UNDERSTANDABLY A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE BUT I I I I THINK THAT -- WE REALLY DO AND I'M LIKE I ASKED YEAH I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANY FURTHER MINUTES FROM THE COMMITTEE AND SO FORTH I THINK WE DO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS HEALTH INFORMATION AND YOU CAN FIND OUT NOT ONLY ABOUT THEIR PAIN MEDICATION Và LOT OF OTHER THINGS. ABOUT PEOPLE VERY SENSITIVE THINGS I THINKSOME OF THE STEROIDS -- ARE SO THE PEOPLE ARE -- ARE ARE ALSO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TO SELL -- AND THEN WE STARTING ABOUT -- S WE START THE OUT WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION CAN CAN BE REVEALED AND AND AND SO FORTH SO -- I APPRECIATE THE THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTING AMENDMENTS THAT REALLY THE SHOULD IT JUST FIRST OF ALL SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR ENFORCEMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE A DATABASE. FOR PEOPLE TO MIND FOR YOU KNOW MARKETING -- FOR INSURANCE OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEN ALSO IT -- I THINK AS THE MATCH BY ACLU WE NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE SOME GOOD BOUNDARIES AROUND. AROUND THIS AGAIN WILE STILL HAVING SERVICE FUNCTION TO BE SURE THAT WE LIMIT YELP USE OF OPIOIDS SELL -- I'M YOU KNOW I'M LESS DEPRECIATE YOUR A FOR ONE OF THEM'S L. SUPPORT THE BILL AS IT AS AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE -- BUT I HOPE WE KEEP IN MIND AS WE THINK MORE ABOUT ACTORS DATABASE BILLS ABOUT THESE PRIVACY ISSUES AND REALLY THINK ABOUT -- WE'LL WHAT KIND OF PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WERE PUTTING AROUND REALLY AT HEALTH DATABASE OF OF OF PARTICULAR SET OF PRESCRIPTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU. THE CENTER PAN SENATOR GALGIANI -- SO I SEE HERE ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS THAT THE SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS ARE GENERALLY USE FOR ANTI ANALGESIC PURPOSES. AND I TYRONE REALLY. IS IS THAT A MISTAKE OR IS THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN BE ON SCHEDULE. FIVE CAN SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT THAT I I SEE IT OVER THE THAT. GOOD TO ME SORRY. LET ME ASK OUR COMMITTEE CANCELED OUT TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION THERE ARE SOME DRUGS AND THAT. THAT WOULD TREAT THOSE CONDITIONS THAT OUR SCHEDULE FIVE THAT WOULD BE REPORTED IN THE CARE SYSTEM UNDER THE SPELL. AND THAT'S PRESCRIPTION OR IS THAT THE OVER THE COUNTER THAT. THESE ARE PRESCRIPTION. ALL SCHEDULES -- TWO THREE FIVE OUR PRESCRIPTION ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME THAT LOOK SIMILAR LIKE A COUGH SYRUP WITH CODEINE. WOULD BE A SCHEDULE FIVE DRUGS WERE AS A COUGH SYRUP THAT IS OVER THE COUNTER IS NOT A SCHEDULED DRUG [inaudible] YOU. SHARE. WELL I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE POINT OF SAYING IS IS THAT -- WELL WE'RE NOT ALL. CONTROL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES OR SOMETHING THAT POTENTIAL -- AS A POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION SO OBVIOUSLY SCHEDULE VICE VERY LOW AND SO THE MAIN OPIOID UNDERS CODING SO BY LIKE CODEINE HELP SUPPRESS COUGH THAT'S ANTI TOSSES -- BUT YOU ALSO HAVE SOME OTHER TYPES OF MEDICATION THEY'RE ALSO SCHEDULE FIVE AS WELL -- BECAUSE THEY HAVE AGAIN VERY LOW POTENTIAL I I PERSONALLY AND I'M NOT OBJECTING TO INCLUDING SCHEDULE FIVE BUT I THINK THE CONCERN I HAVE IS IS THAT. IS THAT REMIND PEOPLE THERE'S A LOT OF DRUGS THAT ARE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE ND SCHEDULES OF TWO THROUGH FIVE OKAY SO WE HAVE TO THROUGH AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PRIVACY ISSUES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT. IN THE WILL IS WHAT ONE COULD ARGUE THESE IN PRICE AROUND OPIOIDS BUT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT ARE ON SCHEDULE TWO THROUGH. FIVE THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PAIN OR OPIOIDS AND THOSE ARE ALL BEING THAT AS A PHYSICIAN THOSE ARE ALL BEING RIGHT STERN CHURCH NOW I CAN ALSO SEE FROM SIMPLICITY STANDPOINT. I KNOW THE SCHEDULE FIVE THEREFORE I HAVE TO REGISTER AND YELL IT MAKES IT EASIER. FOR THE PEOPLE HAVE TO DO THE DATABASE AND ABOUT TO ENTER STUFF IN THE DATABASE TO BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR DEMARCATION I YOU KNOW LIKE. VERSUS SAYING JUST ALL THE ONES WITH CODEINE -- BUT SO I CAN SEE FROM A THAT MYSTERY SIMPLICITY STANDPOINT WAY WE JUST A SCHEDULE FIVE AND BUT THE FDA FIGURED OUT BUT I I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT AGAIN REINFORCES THE NEED FOR A GREAT YOU KNOW FOR BE SURE YOU DRESS THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS -- BUT YES THERE ARE MEDICATIONS ARE THERE TO HAVE NO OPIATES AT ALL OR SCHEDULE FIVE THAT ARE FOR THINGS LIKE YEAH THAT WOULD HELP REDUCE DIARRHEA. ALL RIGHT CENTER GALGIANI GOOD WITH THAT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD OF THE SAYS RELATES TO THIS BILL BEFORE US OKAY CENTER ARE CHILE YES -- I I'M I'M LOOKING AT THIS THAT THIRD PARTY ACCESS BUT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THIS LAST MINUTE -- AMENDMENTS AND AGREEMENTS JUST -- THAT IS GOING TO BE TAKEN CARE OF THE THE WORKMAN'S COMP ISSUE YEAH THAT'S CORRECT HE'S ACCEPTED US AS HE SAID IT DOES IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS OR IT'S A EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE ON THAT HERE -- HE'S BEEN AND I THINK SEVEN EIGHT ONE AND I BY THINK IT'S GOOD FOR THE AMENDMENT THANK YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT WITH THAT -- LET ME -- GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE BUT BEFORE I DO THAT -- ON PAGE THIRTEEN OF THE ANALYSIS THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE OF THE RATIONALE FOR AUTHORIZING PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS WHO.

MY TIMOTHY CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD THE BOARD IS ACTUALLY SUPPORT IF AMENDED THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THAT BILL AS WRITTEN WOULD ABROGATE EXISTING AUTHORITY TO RAISE -- FEES FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN THE CPI HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN AND THE REGISTRAR'S BEEN GREAT I THOUGHT HE TO UPGRADE TO FULL SUPPORT IF THE AMENDMENTSMADE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MAKING ALREADY WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -- IN OPPOSITION TO AB SIX ONE THREE SB SIX THIRTEEN REMOVES LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL FOR FEE INCREASES LEVIED ON LICENSEES BY THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSING BOARD. ALLOWS FOR AUTOMATIC FEE INCREASES EVERY FOUR YEARS WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS AUTHORS OFFER TO THE BILL THERE'S ONLY STILL A MECHANISM FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW THESE BE INCREASES AFTER THEY HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED AT EACH BOARD SUNSET REVIEW. EXISTING LAW ALREADY ALLOWS FOR BOARDS TO SEE FEE INCREASES THEIR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE PROCESSES AND ALSO. AND TO ALSO SEE FEE INCREASES THROUGH THE BOARD SENSE THAT REVIEW PROCESS EXISTING LAW PLACES NO LIMITS ON HOW OFTEN ABOARD CAN REQUEST A FEE INCREASE. OVER RECOGNIZE THAT COSTS CAN INCREASE DUE TO INFLATION AND UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO PROVIDE A PROCESS TO GRADUALLY INCREASE FEES TO REFLECT INFLATION. WE HAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THE BILL'S LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY FOR LICENSEES TO PROVIDE INPUT REGARDING WHETHER FEE INCREASES ARE APPROPRIATE. AND THE ABSENCE OF SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT DEPARTMENTS DO NOT REQUEST MULTIPLE FEE INCREASES THEIR DIFFERENT PROCESS THESE. THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE CEILINGS CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN BOARDS NORMALLY GUARANTEED THAT LARGE FEE INCREASES WILL BE NEEDED IN ADDITION TO THE C. P. I. INCREASES WHEN ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE BORNE BY THE BOARDS. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE HAVE ASKED THE OPPOSE AB SIX THIRTEEN AND LEAVE THE CURRENT AND FUNCTIONAL PROCESS INTACT RETAINING YOUR AUTHORITY OVER LICENSING FEE INCREASES. VERY GOOD OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION RIGHT SPENT RIGHT SPENCER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN OPPOSITION GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SIGNAL BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS DISCUSSION. SENATOR PAT. THANK YOU AND SUMMER LOW IT YOU KNOW. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS A PARTICULAR PROBLEM PRECIADO COMMITTEES WORKED ON IT BUT AND THAT DOES SOMEONE WHO -- SO FULL DISCLOSURE I AM A FEE PAYING LICENSEE. AND SO IS MY WIFE SO -- BUT I THINK -- YOU KNOW MY LEGISLATOR HAD I THINK THAT WE SHOULD EXERCISE MORE NOW -- OVER OVERSIGHT AND SELL FORTY I'M UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL --% TODAY BUT APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS THANK YOU. GOOD SENATOR HILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN IN THANK YOU CARILLO FOR YOU KNOW YOU LISTEN TO THE BOARDS YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY SAY THAT AND I KNOW YOU YOU. YOU YOU WANTED. YEAH MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DO THEIR JOB AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS -- AND I GUESS WHAT THE STRUGGLE THAT I'M HAVING IS TAKING AWAY THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN THAT THE WORDING AND SET IN THOSE FEES. AND AND IT'S IT'S ALMOST GIVING THE BOARD OF BLANK CHECK IN FRANKLY FROM WHAT I'VE. EXPERIENCED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF THIS. WONDERFUL COMMITTEE. I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD WANT TO DO THAT IN GIVEN THE BLANK CHECK AND THAT'S THE STRUGGLE THAT I HAVE. TODAY WITH THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT JUST LIMITED IN THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SUNSET REVIEW THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT PORTS. DID TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING AND HAVE THEY PERFORMED APPROPRIATELY HAVE THE USE THOSE RESOURCES. IN THE RIGHT MANNER TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY STE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WE ALL ARE LOOKING FOR SO I CAN LIKETHE STATUS QUO AND AND ALL THE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY SORRY. I AND AT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. WILL OF THE MEDIA. LET ME SAY THAT -- I APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE COMMENTS FROM MY TWO COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL HERE TODAY -- BUT I THINK YOU WERE TRYING TO SPEAK TO STRIKE A BALANCE HERE. AND WELL I I AS A LEGISLATOR WE LOVE OVERSIGHT AND WE LOVE THE ABILITY TO SAY YES FOR NOW. I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO BE VERY PRAGMATIC ABOUT IT IN THE BILL THAT YOU PUT FOR FORWARD TO US. I ALSO KNOW -- THAT -- ANY BOARD -- AT THAT IS PAYING ATTENTION -- THAT BEFORE THEY WERE TO DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN TERMS OF THE COST OF LIVING INCREASE WHICH IS ALL THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW. I WOULD PROBABLY DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND CHECK IN WITH THE LEGISLATURE NO ONE LIKES TO BE REVERSED. AND THE FACT THAT SET UP THE MOST YOU COULD GET. OUT OF THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US IS -- THREE YEARS MAYBE OF A FEE -- I THINK -- WOULD BE AN INDICATION THAT. THIS IS NOT RUN AWAY AUTHORITY FROM THIS PERSON'S POINT OF VIEW -- BUT I APPRECIATE THAT THE LEARN A JUDGMENT OF MY COLLEAGUES -- WHO HAVE SPOKEN -- AND OPPOSITION TO IT BUT FOR ME I THOUGHT IT STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE. AND I THINK A GOOD THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS COULD BE PLACED IN IT WITH THE SUNSET THAT ALLOW IT TO GO INTO EFFECT. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GO AND RE VISIT AGAIN. BUT I GUESS WE CAN WAIT AND SEE ME MIGHT DISCUSS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES IF YOU WISH BUT I APPRECIATED THE THOUGHTFULNESS THAT YOU PUT INTO THIS. TRYING TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE SO WITH THAT WHEN A BUDGET MAKE ANY KIND OF CLOSING COMMENTS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK -- THE THEY'RE STILL OF THE TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY A CENTER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IS THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY EVEN ROLL BACK. THE INCREASES SO WE STILL HAVE THAT AUTHORITY ASYOU WELL KNOW AS WELL AND ANY OF THESE ENTITIES BOARDS CAN PRESENT A BILL THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE TO WHICH IT STILL HAS THE OPPORTUNITY CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE. TO INCREASE THEIR FEES SO WE STILL RETAINED THAT. AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE CALENDAR EARLY IN ADDITION IT'S STILL ALSO NEED TO BE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIRD WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND RESEARCHER ALL OF US HERE WOULD. BE WELL POSITIONED TO HELP ENSURE THE THE NECESSITY FOR THESE INCREASES -- AND ITSELF SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED A AND IT'S OPTIONAL ONLY AND A VOTE A PUBLIC MEETING BY THE BOARD INTO WHICH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- CAN PARTICIPATE SO THEY'RE STILL SIGNIFICANT CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT ARE PROVIDED -- AND AGAIN WE STILL RETAIN THAT IS ALREADY SO -- I BELIEVE SIMILARLY AS THIS IS CHAIR WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPE OF ACCOUNTING TRANSPARENCY NOT JUST LINDEN. RIGHT RIGHT AWAY WITH IT WITHOUT HAVING PUBLIC INPUT SO WE STILL WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THAT AUTHORITY -- SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IN TERMS OF THE COMMENTS -- AND AGAIN WE WANT TO PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY FOR NOT THESE INCREASES THAT JUST WOULD HAPPEN -- BUT RATHER AN OPTION. WITH THE CPI SO THAT THERE'S A GREATER SENSE OF CERTAINTY WITH THAT -- TOO SO THAT BY SEN SEASONS AND WHY IS IT OF SEND THE FACT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THIS HASN'T HAPPENED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. SO IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THESE ENTITIES BOARDS TO HELP ENSURE THE TYPE OF PROJECTIONS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. OUR WALL ALSO LIMITING THE TYPE OF IMPACT TO LICENSEES AND SO THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND WITH RESPECT BASS PRIVATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT IS THERE A MOTION ON THIS ISSUE. ALL RIGHT SO THAT BILL WILL REMAIN HERE FOR NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SOME REMEMBER GREAT PRESENTING THANK YOU FOR IT.
