As the host of

00:13:08.021 --> 00:13:11.557 region:rollup2
committee.

00:13:09.689 --> 00:13:13.893 region:rollup2
We're not like Washington

00:13:11.557 --> 00:13:16.062 region:rollup2

00:13:16.062 --> 00:13:21.634 region:rollup2
them in a constructive way.

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:23.636 region:rollup2
But most important which.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.303 region:rollup2
Some ways we we we.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.605 region:rollup2
Embarrassed about but we had our

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:28.074 region:rollup2
first

00:13:25.605 --> 00:13:29.676 region:rollup2
hearing on native American boys

00:13:28.074 --> 00:13:33.646 region:rollup2
and young men.

00:13:29.676 --> 00:13:35.782 region:rollup2
Which incidentally you need to

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.817 region:rollup2
know what's the most watched

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:39.952 region:rollup2
online viewing of any hearing

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:41.621 region:rollup2
out of all the selected maybe

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:43.923 region:rollup2
Harry's that we ever had.

00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:45.758 region:rollup2
And in fact that it brought

00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:47.660 region:rollup2
tears to a lot of individuals I.

00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:49.896 region:rollup2
Because it was so impactful.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.931 region:rollup2
And and learning to challenges

00:13:49.896 --> 00:13:53.866 region:rollup2
of native Americans I think

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:56.135 region:rollup2
would not only very formative.

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.770 region:rollup2
Of I think it also ultimately

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:58.438 region:rollup2
opened our eyes that would

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.706 region:rollup2
probably needed a whole lot more

00:13:58.438 --> 00:14:03.710 region:rollup2
a lot sooner.

00:13:59.706 --> 00:14:05.812 region:rollup2
So I I am extremely proud to be.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.978 region:rollup2

Assembly member.

00:15:55.988 --> 00:16:00.460 region:rollup2
I feel like I'm holding on the

00:15:59.892 --> 00:16:03.863 region:rollup2
minute color piece a pretty

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:06.332 region:rollup2
good.

00:16:03.863 --> 00:16:07.900 region:rollup2
And and I recognize our special

00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:09.836 region:rollup2
concerns within our community.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.436 region:rollup2
At their structural historic le

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:11.971 region:rollup2
challenges that we've yet to

00:16:10.436 --> 00:16:13.906 region:rollup2
overcome but.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:14.540 region:rollup2
Our chairman and our committee.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:15.174 region:rollup2
Have been given the opportunity

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.375 region:rollup2
by the voters of our districts

00:16:15.174 --> 00:16:18.077 region:rollup2
to make some important changes

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.678 region:rollup2
in as I was chatting with many

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:18.945 region:rollup2
of you before I the chairman

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:20.213 region:rollup2

Star are meeting.

00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:23.883 region:rollup2
You know hearing from you that

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:24.450 region:rollup2
concerns around mental health

00:16:23.883 --> 00:16:26.052 region:rollup2
around recidivism outcome of

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.686 region:rollup2
justice reform. I will tell you

00:16:26.052 --> 00:16:29.856 region:rollup2
these are issues that we talk

00:16:26.686 --> 00:16:30.490 region:rollup2
about every day in Sacramento

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:30.690 region:rollup2
and Casey we get to act upon

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.158 region:rollup2
into.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.993 region:rollup2
And there are a number of

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:34.560 region:rollup2
things any of you who may saw. A

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:34.927 region:rollup2
governor brown state of the

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.763 region:rollup2
state address.

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:38.431 region:rollup2
Yesterday he's been a

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:40.266 region:rollup2
significant amount time talking

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:43.970 region:rollup2
about issues about come on

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:46.038 region:rollup2
justice reform and try to set

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.107 region:rollup2
people up for success rather

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:50.076 region:rollup2
than continual failure. And some

00:16:48.107 --> 00:16:52.011 region:rollup2
of you live that out and I

00:16:50.076 --> 00:16:53.980 region:rollup2
really appreciate the stories

00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:58.017 region:rollup2
that were shared with me

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.518 region:rollup2
individually help some of you

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:58.784 region:rollup2
will share that with the

00:16:58.518 --> 00:16:59.919 region:rollup2
committee.

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.453 region:rollup2
.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:02.121 region:rollup2
As we go for the hearing.

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:02.688 region:rollup2
But the stories are important

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:03.956 region:rollup2
because they help to change

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:04.557 region:rollup2
policy and that's really why

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.292 region:rollup2
we're here today not just an

00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:08.060 region:rollup2
area grievances but a real

00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.728 region:rollup2
sharing the stories. They can

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.296 region:rollup2
help us to craft legislation to

00:17:08.728 --> 00:17:10.596 region:rollup2
improve people's lives athlete

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:12.398 region:rollup2
quick one.

00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:13.966 region:rollup2
In our chairman was a leader on

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:14.600 region:rollup2
this particular issue.

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:16.102 region:rollup2
Of banning the box and some of

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.037 region:rollup2
you probably know what that

00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:18.671 region:rollup2
means a lot of you probably that

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:20.306 region:rollup2
in a situation we've applied for

00:17:18.671 --> 00:17:20.907 region:rollup2
employment. All you got a good

00:17:20.306 --> 00:17:22.375 region:rollup2
interview but you can get the

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:22.675 region:rollup2
job simply because of a criminal

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.377 region:rollup2
background.

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:25.912 region:rollup2
That you couldn't clear it's

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.512 region:rollup2
interesting that you know if you

00:17:25.912 --> 00:17:27.914 region:rollup2
don't ask that question on the

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.548 region:rollup2
front end.

00:17:27.914 --> 00:17:29.916 region:rollup2
You tend to be able to get the

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.583 region:rollup2
job.

00:17:29.916 --> 00:17:32.285 region:rollup2
And so California we vote we

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:32.818 region:rollup2
voted that we approved in the

00:17:32.285 --> 00:17:34.053 region:rollup2
governor signed a bill to

00:17:32.818 --> 00:17:34.553 region:rollup2
eliminate the box of that

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.055 region:rollup2
question is not asked.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:38.157 region:rollup2
When you apply for the job you

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:39.926 region:rollup2
can work that out afterward if

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:40.560 region:rollup2
it off of an offer employment is

00:17:39.926 --> 00:17:42.361 region:rollup2
made. Aye best transformational

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.330 region:rollup2
for helping people actually get

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:45.898 region:rollup2
jobs to be able to make the rent

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.599 region:rollup2
a to meet your responsibilities.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.000 region:rollup2
And that's legislation that came

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.601 region:rollup2
from the community from folks

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.136 region:rollup2
who've Y. live this life and

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:50.770 region:rollup2
walked in the issues that people

00:17:50.136 --> 00:17:52.138 region:rollup2
like Reggie and I are here to

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.772 region:rollup2
listen to. So that we can find

00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:54.006 region:rollup2
the next piece of legislation

00:17:52.772 --> 00:17:54.607 region:rollup2
that will improve people's lives

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:56.108 region:rollup2
and give our men and boys of

00:17:54.607 --> 00:17:57.944 region:rollup2
color a fighting chance. At

Selling drugs are part of gangs

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:00.132 region:rollup2
so I really didn't have anybody

00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:02.368 region:rollup2
at home.

00:20:00.132 --> 00:20:04.170 region:rollup2
I was hungry so I gave me five

00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:06.138 region:rollup2
dollars I get to school my

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.140 region:rollup2

His burrito hand reaches over.

00:20:20.119 --> 00:20:24.323 region:rollup2

Because he was hungry.

00:20:56.822 --> 00:21:00.593 region:rollup2
This order.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.394 region:rollup2
And so I decide to write a

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:02.928 region:rollup2
resolution and it. Was to put it

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:04.296 region:rollup2
will tell you if you do

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:06.465 region:rollup2
resolution I can make a

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:08.134 region:rollup2
resolution that dishonest purple

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:10.636 region:rollup2
and I'll get through.

00:21:08.134 --> 00:21:12.138 region:rollup2
Frazier Friedman no matter what

00:21:10.636 --> 00:21:12.772 region:rollup2
this one took six months.

00:21:12.138 --> 00:21:14.507 region:rollup2
Because the professionals just

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:16.375 region:rollup2
descended on me and told me I

00:21:14.507 --> 00:21:18.210 region:rollup2
couldn't diagnose anything

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:20.279 region:rollup2
because I'm not a doctor I don't

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.813 region:rollup2
have. I do know what goes on in

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.248 region:rollup2
my community but I can't.

00:21:20.813 --> 00:21:24.550 region:rollup2
Diagnosis.

00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:26.452 region:rollup2
So they want to call it ace is a

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.121 region:rollup2
trauma informed care assiduous

00:21:26.452 --> 00:21:29.722 region:rollup2
fine I just need.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:29.889 region:rollup2
Figure out a way to take care

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:32.091 region:rollup2
of.

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:34.026 region:rollup2
Even even though they denied us

00:21:32.091 --> 00:21:35.728 region:rollup2
having a hundred million dollars

00:21:34.026 --> 00:21:37.630 region:rollup2
for boys and men of color.

00:21:35.728 --> 00:21:39.799 region:rollup2
Because a prop tool nine.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.466 region:rollup2
We can't do that anymore we get.

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.767 region:rollup2
Direct funds directly to people

00:21:40.466 --> 00:21:43.669 region:rollup2
of color.

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:46.105 region:rollup2
So we decided.

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:47.673 region:rollup2
That this year after I got the

00:21:46.105 --> 00:21:48.307 region:rollup2
resolution through.

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:51.677 region:rollup2
That we would ask for a hundred

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:52.311 region:rollup2
million dollars.

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:54.046 region:rollup2
Post traumatic stress disorder

00:21:52.311 --> 00:21:56.215 region:rollup2
to help boys and men of color

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:58.083 region:rollup2
and girls and women of color.

00:21:56.215 --> 00:21:59.718 region:rollup2
Who've been traumatized in there

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:02.087 region:rollup2
disadvantaged communities

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:03.656 region:rollup2
to help them deal with that so

00:22:02.087 --> 00:22:05.824 region:rollup2
they can better able.

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:07.827 region:rollup2
Matriculated on a link to to

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.027 region:rollup2
school but to be able to. Deal

00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:11.697 region:rollup2
with.

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:12.298 region:rollup2
Situations and and.

00:22:11.697 --> 00:22:14.133 region:rollup2
In a communities lot better.

00:22:12.298 --> 00:22:14.767 region:rollup2
I'm telling you that because

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:15.834 region:rollup2
Raskin for that hundred million

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:17.736 region:rollup2
dollars today.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:19.738 region:rollup2
Your testimony.

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:21.740 region:rollup2
Could be a pivotal.

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:23.876 region:rollup2
Example of why we need.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.778 region:rollup2
So that's why it's so important

00:22:23.876 --> 00:22:26.412 region:rollup2
for us to get your testimony is

00:22:25.778 --> 00:22:27.746 region:rollup2
so poured for us to go all over

00:22:26.412 --> 00:22:29.815 region:rollup2

Alright Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher

And calmly got. Office of

I it's good to see all your

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.268 region:rollup2
faces out here many of you I

00:23:56.068 --> 00:23:58.370 region:rollup2
know.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:24:00.205 region:rollup2
I'm Kevin Malone I've had the

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.773 region:rollup2
privilege of working with the

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.874 region:rollup2
San Diego organizing project

00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:03.976 region:rollup2
for.

00:24:01.874 --> 00:24:06.011 region:rollup2
More than fifteen years.

00:24:03.976 --> 00:24:09.882 region:rollup2
Our work is to build powerful

00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:10.082 region:rollup2
organizations in congregations.

00:24:09.882 --> 00:24:13.819 region:rollup2
That.

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:14.219 region:rollup2
Begin to live out their faith

00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:16.188 region:rollup2
in public life.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:18.057 region:rollup2
And I'm part of that peco

00:24:16.188 --> 00:24:18.424 region:rollup2
California network that does a

00:24:18.057 --> 00:24:20.125 region:rollup2
lot of work.

00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:21.860 region:rollup2
Around the state.

00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:24.029 region:rollup2
.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.031 region:rollup2
So we were there when this this

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:28.133 region:rollup2
commission got form more than

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:30.069 region:rollup2
ten years ago and what I was

00:24:28.133 --> 00:24:31.971 region:rollup2
afraid of is. Is that.

00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:34.006 region:rollup2
It would be a commission where

00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:36.275 region:rollup2
impossible problems go to

00:24:34.006 --> 00:24:38.210 region:rollup2
disappear. And I'm happy to say

00:24:36.275 --> 00:24:40.245 region:rollup2
it doesn't feel like that at all

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.679 region:rollup2
that some good work has been

00:24:40.245 --> 00:24:42.381 region:rollup2
done through this.

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.581 region:rollup2
Normally I wouldn't be here

00:24:42.381 --> 00:24:43.916 region:rollup2
today.

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:46.285 region:rollup2
.

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:47.886 region:rollup2
My job is to train leaders and

00:24:46.285 --> 00:24:50.055 region:rollup2
clergy to to.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:52.191 region:rollup2
To be the person who speaks

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:53.892 region:rollup2
Arabic I got challenged by my

00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:55.894 region:rollup2
African American friends.

00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:57.930 region:rollup2
To be the face today.

00:24:55.894 --> 00:24:59.865 region:rollup2
Because it's important for

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.967 region:rollup2
white allies to occupy the space

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:04.069 region:rollup2
and named the the evils of

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:06.205 region:rollup2
structural racism and white

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:07.973 region:rollup2
supremacy. That under gird this

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:10.376 region:rollup2
entire conversation and.

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:11.977 region:rollup2
We need to be the ones.

00:25:10.376 --> 00:25:14.279 region:rollup2
Changing it to.

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:16.315 region:rollup2
And we need to be in the spaces

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:18.050 region:rollup2
and and be brave enough to say

00:25:16.315 --> 00:25:19.952 region:rollup2
we're not there yet.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.254 region:rollup2
And it hurts us to.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:22.888 region:rollup2
I like what more fee it's in

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:23.922 region:rollup2
the mid and from the movie the

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.958 region:rollup2
matrix said that the matrix is

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:28.293 region:rollup2
cage for your mind.

00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:31.930 region:rollup2
And racism operates like that.

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:32.331 region:rollup2
Were all in cages the cages

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.299 region:rollup2
look differently.

00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:36.001 region:rollup2
And we're learning more and

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:36.268 region:rollup2
more about.

00:25:36.001 --> 00:25:40.039 region:rollup2
That that.

00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:40.572 region:rollup2
The. Nature of that cage at

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:40.773 region:rollup2
through conversations like

00:25:40.572 --> 00:25:42.007 region:rollup2
these.

00:25:40.773 --> 00:25:44.476 region:rollup2
.

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:46.345 region:rollup2
And this one just like noodles

00:25:44.476 --> 00:25:48.313 region:rollup2
me I I can't stop thinking about

00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:50.082 region:rollup2
it and you all know it because

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:51.984 region:rollup2
your experts and I see so many

00:25:50.082 --> 00:25:52.618 region:rollup2
faces I've worked without here.

00:25:51.984 --> 00:25:53.986 region:rollup2
But but drama can be passed on

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:55.988 region:rollup2
genetically.

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:58.424 region:rollup2
Lake.

00:25:55.988 --> 00:26:00.159 region:rollup2
Noodle on that for a minute and

00:25:58.424 --> 00:26:00.592 region:rollup2
and and imagine what we're

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:04.096 region:rollup2
really up against.

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:04.696 region:rollup2
This is a long term work and it

00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:05.998 region:rollup2
burns in me the last sixteen

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:08.400 region:rollup2
years as.

00:26:05.998 --> 00:26:10.135 region:rollup2
Director and organize your

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.937 region:rollup2
nasty O. P. this is banned in

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:14.006 region:rollup2
the center of our work.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:14.606 region:rollup2
The cradle to prison pipeline

00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:16.041 region:rollup2
before people are using that

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:16.642 region:rollup2
language I think we were.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.043 region:rollup2
I'm also here because we have

00:26:16.642 --> 00:26:22.014 region:rollup2
failed.

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:22.448 region:rollup2
I think we've made some strides

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:24.049 region:rollup2
in the last decade.

00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.683 region:rollup2
.

00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:26.318 region:rollup2
So I can remember being in the

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:28.120 region:rollup2
meeting of criminal justice

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:32.024 region:rollup2
reform advocates in in

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.992 region:rollup2
Sacramento fifteen years ago.

00:26:32.024 --> 00:26:34.593 region:rollup2
When I said the problem is prop

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:36.061 region:rollup2
thirteen reduce investing in

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:38.597 region:rollup2
communities caller.

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:40.599 region:rollup2
I laughed out of that room.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:42.501 region:rollup2
I was also a rumor said that

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:44.303 region:rollup2
hate if we don't if we don't

00:26:42.501 --> 00:26:46.138 region:rollup2
talk about money bail reform

00:26:44.303 --> 00:26:46.738 region:rollup2
we're never going to get

00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:48.107 region:rollup2
anywhere I got laughed out of

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:50.275 region:rollup2
that room to.

00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:53.178 region:rollup2
People said we can't fight that

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:53.879 region:rollup2
and and I'm happy to be here to

00:26:53.178 --> 00:26:55.414 region:rollup2
say that we have taken some good

00:26:53.879 --> 00:27:05.390 region:rollup2
strides.

00:26:55.414 --> 00:27:07.392 region:rollup2
And for me this is a.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:11.396 region:rollup2
Some to give me many men.

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:13.398 region:rollup2
Thank you.

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:15.434 region:rollup2
A third of my son's friend.

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:19.438 region:rollup2
It.

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:19.972 region:rollup2
Another third or in that it.

00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:21.440 region:rollup2
Jobs another third written

00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:21.607 region:rollup2
military.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:21.740 region:rollup2
And.

00:27:21.607 --> 00:27:25.444 region:rollup2
.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:29.448 region:rollup2
So.

00:27:25.444 --> 00:27:29.948 region:rollup2
I know that I have failed.

00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:31.450 region:rollup2
This system is failing.

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:33.652 region:rollup2
Everyone.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.687 region:rollup2
And I I going to I only got

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.954 region:rollup2
three minutes that's not a lot

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:37.589 region:rollup2
of time.

00:27:35.954 --> 00:27:39.424 region:rollup2
My work with a lot of pastors

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:41.827 region:rollup2
so give me an extra minute.

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:43.762 region:rollup2
So make make no small plans for

00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:45.898 region:rollup2
they have not the magic to stir

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:47.699 region:rollup2
one's imagination that from

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:49.468 region:rollup2
Daniel burns and I think we

00:27:47.699 --> 00:27:51.570 region:rollup2
don't dream big enough.

00:27:49.468 --> 00:27:53.438 region:rollup2
I I think we need bigger dreams

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.039 region:rollup2
if we're really going to address

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:55.874 region:rollup2
the violence of poverty and

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:57.809 region:rollup2
racism. We need bigger dreams

00:27:55.874 --> 00:27:59.645 region:rollup2
and and we need to start

00:27:57.809 --> 00:28:00.245 region:rollup2
speaking to those dreams and

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:01.480 region:rollup2
naming the evils that we're up

00:28:00.245 --> 00:28:03.982 region:rollup2
against.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.450 region:rollup2
So we must talk about universal

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:07.686 region:rollup2
basic income.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:11.423 region:rollup2
But is it we must begin to think

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:13.425 region:rollup2
about. Changing how we employ

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:15.494 region:rollup2
people we must begin to value

00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:17.496 region:rollup2
teachers and pay them better and

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.030 region:rollup2
hold them more accountable. We

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:19.865 region:rollup2
all know these things.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.533 region:rollup2
We need universal high quality

00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:23.535 region:rollup2
preschool.

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:25.737 region:rollup2
We need to have been.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:27.506 region:rollup2
Universal healthcare and we need

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:28.073 region:rollup2
to talk about the social

00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:29.808 region:rollup2
determinants of health that

00:28:28.073 --> 00:28:31.810 region:rollup2
determine where young people of

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:33.712 region:rollup2
color going and we must name

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.313 region:rollup2
that we must invest in our use

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.514 region:rollup2
we must. Invest in these poor

00:28:34.313 --> 00:28:37.816 region:rollup2
neighborhoods

00:28:35.514 --> 00:28:39.952 region:rollup2
criminal justice reform your all

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:41.787 region:rollup2
experts on it we designed a

00:28:39.952 --> 00:28:45.490 region:rollup2
system that incarcerate

00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:46.158 region:rollup2
incarcerate incarcerate and

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.492 region:rollup2
there's never conversation about

00:28:46.158 --> 00:28:49.528 region:rollup2
real ability.

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:51.663 region:rollup2
It's the second you walked in

00:28:49.528 --> 00:28:52.297 region:rollup2
somebody gave you a hug and said

00:28:51.663 --> 00:28:53.832 region:rollup2
you're forgiven now go forgive

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:55.801 region:rollup2
yourself and repair your

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:57.569 region:rollup2
relationships what if we had

00:28:55.801 --> 00:28:59.771 region:rollup2
that kind of system.

00:28:57.569 --> 00:29:00.372 region:rollup2
In California Pico California's

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.573 region:rollup2
leading a conversation that's

00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:03.709 region:rollup2
called heat.

00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:05.611 region:rollup2
If we're really going to

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:07.713 region:rollup2
transform law enforcement we

00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:09.715 region:rollup2
must hire differently we must

00:29:07.713 --> 00:29:11.550 region:rollup2
equip differently we must hold

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:13.552 region:rollup2
the system accountable

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.687 region:rollup2
differently and we must train.

00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:17.522 region:rollup2
We'll differently what if every

00:29:15.687 --> 00:29:19.558 region:rollup2
prison guard was a trained

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:20.259 region:rollup2
mental health experts.

00:29:19.558 --> 00:29:23.528 region:rollup2
And what if what if every police

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:25.530 region:rollup2
officer had two years of

00:29:23.528 --> 00:29:27.566 region:rollup2
training. And. And and

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.768 region:rollup2
tendencies towards aggression

00:29:27.566 --> 00:29:31.637 region:rollup2
were identified right like they

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:32.271 region:rollup2
do in Finland. I know I'm

00:29:31.637 --> 00:29:34.006 region:rollup2
running out of time here we

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:37.643 region:rollup2
we've done some good things prop

00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:39.745 region:rollup2
47-57 the support of you in and

00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:41.847 region:rollup2
the great doctor Weber. And and

00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:43.615 region:rollup2
all of her work and we must do

00:29:41.847 --> 00:29:45.550 region:rollup2
the bail Reform.

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:47.653 region:rollup2
We must continue to expand

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.755 region:rollup2
alternatives to detention they

00:29:47.653 --> 00:29:51.657 region:rollup2
work we must expand restorative

00:29:49.755 --> 00:29:53.592 region:rollup2
justice programs like mid city

00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:55.727 region:rollup2
can has they work.

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:57.663 region:rollup2
Ian Gordon created with our help

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:59.464 region:rollup2
a youth development office here

00:29:57.663 --> 00:30:01.667 region:rollup2
that's massively under funded we

00:29:59.464 --> 00:30:03.602 region:rollup2
must expand work like that and

00:30:01.667 --> 00:30:04.236 region:rollup2
diversion. Last thing I'll say

00:30:03.602 --> 00:30:06.171 region:rollup2
I'm running out of time there's

00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:08.073 region:rollup2
a good program and to the best.

00:30:06.171 --> 00:30:09.908 region:rollup2
South Bay community services we

00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:13.578 region:rollup2
want a promise neighborhood

00:30:09.908 --> 00:30:15.714 region:rollup2
grant out. And it is working. It

00:30:13.578 --> 00:30:17.783 region:rollup2
is working investing in families

00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:19.785 region:rollup2
investing in and their jobs

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:21.953 region:rollup2
investing in the school's

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:23.822 region:rollup2
wrapping these communities up

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:25.857 region:rollup2
with a massive in and out

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:27.626 region:rollup2
inundation of services changes

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:29.528 region:rollup2
outcomes.

00:30:27.626 --> 00:30:31.530 region:rollup2
But you have to do it all.

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:33.999 region:rollup2
Wrap up please. Alright.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.801 region:rollup2
I have more ideas for good

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:36.435 region:rollup2
things that are working but I'm

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:37.669 region:rollup2
sure there's going to talk about

00:30:36.435 --> 00:30:43.608 region:rollup2
it.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:45.711 region:rollup2
Thank you.

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:47.713 region:rollup2
I am a boy of color.

00:30:45.711 --> 00:30:50.015 region:rollup2
I am a man of color.

00:30:47.713 --> 00:30:51.717 region:rollup2
I'm a boy that was raised in the

00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:54.019 region:rollup2
juvenile justice system.

00:30:51.717 --> 00:30:55.687 region:rollup2
And also a man that was raised

00:30:54.019 --> 00:30:57.589 region:rollup2
into incarceration.

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:59.958 region:rollup2
Presented by plan.

00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:01.593 region:rollup2
Now I'm a family man I'm a

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:03.895 region:rollup2
father.

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:06.098 region:rollup2
I'm a community service deter

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:07.632 region:rollup2
you know founder of you think

00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:09.735 region:rollup2
part of it.

00:31:07.632 --> 00:31:11.636 region:rollup2
My story began. Five years ago.

00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:13.939 region:rollup2
I got out.

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:17.642 region:rollup2
A did fourteen your screen went

00:31:13.939 --> 00:31:18.243 region:rollup2
back in out of the system.

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.644 region:rollup2
In out violations got to wear

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:21.646 region:rollup2
the terms.

00:31:19.644 --> 00:31:23.882 region:rollup2
I got out.

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:25.617 region:rollup2
And I began to work on my so

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:27.719 region:rollup2
that pulls dramatic.

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:29.921 region:rollup2
Trombone.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:30.522 region:rollup2
I began to identify were to come

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.723 region:rollup2
from and I began to heal from

00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:33.725 region:rollup2
it.

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:35.861 region:rollup2
I had a compassionate.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:37.696 region:rollup2
Provisional officer by the name

00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:37.929 region:rollup2
of Jay mac which is a midi mac.

00:31:37.696 --> 00:31:39.731 region:rollup2
Cheese.

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:41.800 region:rollup2
Husband.

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:43.769 region:rollup2
And he showed me compassion he

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.403 region:rollup2
showed me love you show me war.

00:31:43.769 --> 00:31:47.773 region:rollup2
So be opportunity to get on the

00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:49.775 region:rollup2
right direction.

00:31:47.773 --> 00:31:50.409 region:rollup2
I was on AB one or nine.

00:31:49.775 --> 00:31:51.910 region:rollup2
And I was able to get off in

00:31:50.409 --> 00:31:53.779 region:rollup2
record time six and a half

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.847 region:rollup2
months.

00:31:53.779 --> 00:31:57.783 region:rollup2
I discharged my first time being

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:59.751 region:rollup2
able to get away from this is.

00:31:57.783 --> 00:32:01.820 region:rollup2
So I got away from the system.

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:02.420 region:rollup2
And an unfortunate situation

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.657 region:rollup2
where my son ended up in mercy

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.091 region:rollup2
hospital.

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:08.126 region:rollup2
I weighed and the.

00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:10.061 region:rollup2
When I was there are officer

00:32:08.126 --> 00:32:11.997 region:rollup2
leave John Cooksey which was.

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:13.799 region:rollup2
Used to work for the mid city

00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:14.466 region:rollup2
police department.

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:16.301 region:rollup2
And I seen his compassion his

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:17.736 region:rollup2
love that he was showing towards

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.003 region:rollup2
my son.

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:20.071 region:rollup2
And so.

00:32:18.003 --> 00:32:20.572 region:rollup2
I let him talk for like five

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.740 region:rollup2
minutes but he made the

00:32:20.572 --> 00:32:24.009 region:rollup2
connection.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:26.044 region:rollup2
And then I told him my story he

00:32:24.009 --> 00:32:27.913 region:rollup2
invited me to our mid city

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:28.180 region:rollup2
police department are in city

heights.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.917 region:rollup2
And.

00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:33.718 region:rollup2
My wife and I we took a leap of

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:35.854 region:rollup2
faith and we walked in there.

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:36.521 region:rollup2
My nervous system was out of

00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:38.089 region:rollup2
whack is the first time I have

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:39.724 region:rollup2
been to a police department on

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:41.960 region:rollup2
these terms.

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:43.728 region:rollup2
But I Nguyen my give it a shot

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.997 region:rollup2
so we walked in there.

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:47.866 region:rollup2
And I seem of Sir John Cooksey

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:48.500 region:rollup2
and our Dana brown and see

00:32:47.866 --> 00:32:51.970 region:rollup2
wrapped around me and showed me

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.237 region:rollup2
love. Compassion made me feel

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:53.772 region:rollup2
welcome.

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:55.774 region:rollup2
Within a month.

00:32:53.772 --> 00:32:57.776 region:rollup2
I was out in the community.

00:32:55.774 --> 00:32:59.978 region:rollup2
City heights.

00:32:57.776 --> 00:33:02.180 region:rollup2

on a grassroots effort.

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:15.760 region:rollup2
Which is reaching out to our

00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:17.762 region:rollup2
community.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.731 region:rollup2
Within that time.

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:21.833 region:rollup2
Were able to build relationships

working hard to gather.

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:39.457 region:rollup2

to.

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:44.962 region:rollup2
Going on.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.496 region:rollup2
To.

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:46.931 region:rollup2
Develop skills off other

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:48.1000 region:rollup2
people's

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:51.002 region:rollup2
and.

00:42:48.1000 --> 00:42:56.107 region:rollup2
I think.

00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:59.811 region:rollup2
The fifth.

00:42:56.107 --> 00:43:02.146 region:rollup2
Gloria.

00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:03.881 region:rollup2
I request that I would just ask

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.415 region:rollup2
the members the panel and. Thank

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:06.250 region:rollup2
you by the way for. Your

00:43:04.415 --> 00:43:06.818 region:rollup2
testimony and for what each of

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.152 region:rollup2
your respectively doing to

00:43:06.818 --> 00:43:10.154 region:rollup2
advance the concerns of this

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:12.156 region:rollup2
committee. On Kevin I think was

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:13.858 region:rollup2
a. Are a light touch my life and

00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:14.559 region:rollup2
policy priorities I'm some of

00:43:13.858 --> 00:43:16.194 region:rollup2
which I think we may tackle this

00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:18.162 region:rollup2
year specific bill reform. Was

00:43:16.194 --> 00:43:19.997 region:rollup2
curious maybe for each of your

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:20.598 region:rollup2
question of what would be if you

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:23.901 region:rollup2
were in our shoes what's the

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:25.937 region:rollup2
number one legislative issues

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:28.072 region:rollup2
would want us to tackle in.

00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:28.573 region:rollup2
With Isabella form needed I

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:30.308 region:rollup2
think money go formally

00:43:28.573 --> 00:43:31.943 region:rollup2
grandstand or hopefully many of

00:43:30.308 --> 00:43:32.610 region:rollup2
you understand what that is but.

00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:33.177 region:rollup2
Of for each of you individually

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.378 region:rollup2
since you occupy different

00:43:33.177 --> 00:43:36.147 region:rollup2
spaces of of of this issue. And

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:38.249 region:rollup2
what would you ask us to go back

00:43:36.147 --> 00:43:39.917 region:rollup2
on Monday up the capital and

00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:40.551 region:rollup2
work on space.

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:44.122 region:rollup2
Whether there's two there's two

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:45.957 region:rollup2
things of. Violence said one but

00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:48.326 region:rollup2
okay.

00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:48.559 region:rollup2
That the individual with the

00:43:48.326 --> 00:43:49.961 region:rollup2
record.

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:52.130 region:rollup2
.

00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:53.998 region:rollup2
Breaking that policy like Kern

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:54.665 region:rollup2
you we have a planning its of

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:56.000 region:rollup2
two we have all top probation

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:58.302 region:rollup2
public safety.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.238 region:rollup2
A part of that that planning is

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.771 region:rollup2
to and when have a document that

00:44:00.238 --> 00:44:02.006 region:rollup2
we're going to be able to

00:44:00.771 --> 00:44:04.208 region:rollup2
present.

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:06.277 region:rollup2
And that is that people would

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.577 region:rollup2
live experience records that are

00:44:06.277 --> 00:44:08.379 region:rollup2
a bit it.

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:10.314 region:rollup2
In the community and doing

00:44:08.379 --> 00:44:12.016 region:rollup2
great work that they be given

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:14.018 region:rollup2
the opportunity to.

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:16.053 region:rollup2
Be able to get contracts and

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:17.955 region:rollup2
Exeter and work with the boys

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:19.991 region:rollup2
and men of color. As far as

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:20.625 region:rollup2
specifically for this grant.

00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:23.895 region:rollup2
Were blowing this thing up the

00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:24.495 region:rollup2
park and our biggest need.

00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:26.164 region:rollup2
For this you for young adults

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:30.034 region:rollup2
eighteen to twenty four. Has

00:44:26.164 --> 00:44:31.936 region:rollup2
been. Half of them are homeless.

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:33.938 region:rollup2
Their culture for.

00:44:31.936 --> 00:44:36.407 region:rollup2
Thank you.

00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:38.042 region:rollup2
John how I'll go ahead and jump

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:40.044 region:rollup2
into.

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:42.180 region:rollup2
So again my of my.

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:44.415 region:rollup2
Lance is re engaging. And so

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:46.083 region:rollup2
what I what I think the most

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:48.252 region:rollup2
important thing we can do is to

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:50.354 region:rollup2
provide a. Incentives new

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:53.991 region:rollup2
resources tattooing to increase

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:56.060 region:rollup2
the partnerships between schools

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:57.995 region:rollup2
and other community services so

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.596 region:rollup2
that you can address harmonise

00:44:57.995 --> 00:45:00.298 region:rollup2
homelessness and mental health

00:44:58.596 --> 00:45:02.033 region:rollup2
issues and all the rest. Their

00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:04.035 region:rollup2
work we're trying to do

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:06.070 region:rollup2
hodgepodge but we need resources

00:45:04.035 --> 00:45:08.406 region:rollup2
and and more support from the.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:10.374 region:rollup2
But I got a long list of the

00:45:08.406 --> 00:45:12.143 region:rollup2
been shortened Ivan. So there's.

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:12.810 region:rollup2
Really I didn't get to this year

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:14.512 region:rollup2
but there's good work happening

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.447 region:rollup2
here to blow up you know how I

00:45:14.512 --> 00:45:18.115 region:rollup2
just said that I don't mean

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:20.451 region:rollup2
blown up I mean scraping it.

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:22.086 region:rollup2
And completely transforming

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:24.222 region:rollup2
juvenile hall into a.

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:26.123 region:rollup2
So I think I don't know what

00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:28.059 region:rollup2
state enabling stuff lies in

00:45:26.123 --> 00:45:29.994 region:rollup2
there. But the other really big

00:45:28.059 --> 00:45:32.263 region:rollup2
priority is the marijuana tax.

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:32.797 region:rollup2
That their resources the twenty

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:34.098 region:rollup2
percent that goes to law

00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:36.867 region:rollup2
enforcement.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:38.603 region:rollup2
Percent that's supposed to be

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:40.638 region:rollup2
focused on use. Gets targeted

00:45:38.603 --> 00:45:42.607 region:rollup2
into a use reparations model.

00:45:40.638 --> 00:45:44.642 region:rollup2
The drug war differently

00:45:42.607 --> 00:45:46.711 region:rollup2
impacted communities of color.

00:45:44.642 --> 00:45:54.619 region:rollup2
These resources need to be

00:45:46.711 --> 00:45:56.621 region:rollup2
invested in those same.

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:58.623 region:rollup2
You in season.

00:45:56.621 --> 00:46:02.627 region:rollup2
Would.

00:45:58.623 --> 00:46:04.895 region:rollup2
Did you want to add.

00:46:02.627 --> 00:46:06.797 region:rollup2
Yeah. I am I'm sorry mom I got I

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:07.465 region:rollup2
got along they but yeah it's

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:10.701 region:rollup2
it's I just want to support our

00:46:07.465 --> 00:46:11.135 region:rollup2
third one of our goals locally.

00:46:10.701 --> 00:46:13.004 region:rollup2
To support emerging

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:14.872 region:rollup2
organizations led by those most

00:46:13.004 --> 00:46:16.874 region:rollup2
impacted in led by people of

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:19.043 region:rollup2
color. It is very difficult for

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:22.747 region:rollup2
the small organizations to find

00:46:19.043 --> 00:46:24.749 region:rollup2
support at the county. And the

00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:30.688 region:rollup2
state levels and we need to

00:46:24.749 --> 00:46:32.990 region:rollup2
figure out how to do that if.

00:46:30.688 --> 00:46:34.792 region:rollup2
With think a panel on and I'll

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:36.927 region:rollup2
just leave you. With this.

00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:38.696 region:rollup2
The assembly on the chair of

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:40.998 region:rollup2
public safety.

00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:42.733 region:rollup2
Chair of public safety budget is

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:44.635 region:rollup2
Dr Shirley Weber.

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:47.104 region:rollup2
And my.

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:49.040 region:rollup2
The other like our counterparts

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:50.941 region:rollup2
is a need to Skinner who's over

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.175 region:rollup2
both budget and policy public

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.743 region:rollup2
safety.

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:56.647 region:rollup2
A we have a goal.

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:58.749 region:rollup2
And I've.

00:46:56.647 --> 00:47:00.718 region:rollup2
Crafting a but do something.

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:02.720 region:rollup2
Said and.

00:47:00.718 --> 00:47:05.623 region:rollup2
We've been saying that we.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.257 region:rollup2
Before we leave.

00:47:05.623 --> 00:47:07.858 region:rollup2
We want to do something it's

00:47:06.257 --> 00:47:09.627 region:rollup2
never been done before which is

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:11.595 region:rollup2
close to prison.

00:47:09.627 --> 00:47:12.229 region:rollup2
Never been done we building like

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.631 region:rollup2
crazy. We build a more than we

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:15.666 region:rollup2
build universities.

00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:16.233 region:rollup2
A but we never close one.

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:17.668 region:rollup2
So we've we've readjusted it

00:47:16.233 --> 00:47:19.670 region:rollup2
based on.

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:21.572 region:rollup2
What I'm hearing is?

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:23.674 region:rollup2
Maybe.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:25.743 region:rollup2
We changed the facility.

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:27.678 region:rollup2
State of it being a prison will

00:47:25.743 --> 00:47:28.279 region:rollup2
be education center a campus and

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.613 region:rollup2
and the nature I would love to

00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:31.716 region:rollup2
talk to you.

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:33.684 region:rollup2
Each of you give us input.

00:47:31.716 --> 00:47:34.318 region:rollup2
On as we reduced.

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:34.919 region:rollup2
The footprint of the number of

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.553 region:rollup2
people there Carceri difficult

00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:37.855 region:rollup2
problems

00:47:35.553 --> 00:47:39.590 region:rollup2
forty seven fifty said

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:40.157 region:rollup2
rehabilitation.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.792 region:rollup2
How do we build these new

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:43.694 region:rollup2
facilities for education

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:45.830 region:rollup2
rehabilitation and?

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:47.965 region:rollup2
Homelessness and and so I would

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.600 region:rollup2
love to follow up if you follow

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:55.740 region:rollup2
that our staff on this

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:57.641 region:rollup2
again I think the path.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.877 region:rollup2
So on our education panel.

00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.879 region:rollup2
Would like to bring up Frank

00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:03.647 region:rollup2
Harris and Luke would San Diego

I Frank in Luke first.

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:35.679 region:rollup2
Harrison would.

Sandiego state.

00:48:35.679 --> 00:48:39.750 region:rollup2
Doctor Weber.

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:41.752 region:rollup2
Former.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.654 region:rollup2
The university.

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.656 region:rollup2
Weber here happens.

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:47.725 region:rollup2
Not that way.

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:53.664 region:rollup2
Well good good afternoon.

00:48:47.725 --> 00:48:55.699 region:rollup2
First one.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:57.701 region:rollup2
And I'll join you with my car.

00:48:55.699 --> 00:49:00.070 region:rollup2
Both.

00:48:57.701 --> 00:49:01.806 region:rollup2
Back here said it was state

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
university.

00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:05.810 region:rollup2
Mission college.

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:07.845 region:rollup2
College.

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:09.847 region:rollup2
Assessment lab colleagues CO.

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:11.849 region:rollup2
And we do work on on education.

00:49:09.847 --> 00:49:12.450 region:rollup2
Thank you.

00:49:11.849 --> 00:49:13.918 region:rollup2
We do work that focuses on

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:15.953 region:rollup2
equity related education issues

00:49:13.918 --> 00:49:17.988 region:rollup2
that impact. The status of boys

00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:19.790 region:rollup2
and men of color up. Primarily

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:20.391 region:rollup2
focused on community colleges

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.826 region:rollup2
but not exclusively focus on

00:49:20.391 --> 00:49:24.295 region:rollup2
communicable edges.

00:49:21.826 --> 00:49:25.796 region:rollup2
So I became the data share some

00:49:24.295 --> 00:49:26.463 region:rollup2
the days we've been learning

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.265 region:rollup2
from that work for for nearly a

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:30.267 region:rollup2
decade. I'm exhausted eyes as

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:32.102 region:rollup2
well as to discuss a potential

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:33.771 region:rollup2
recommendations and next steps

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.338 region:rollup2
about.

00:49:33.771 --> 00:49:36.207 region:rollup2
Things that we can do as a

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:38.008 region:rollup2
community are you know perhaps

00:49:36.207 --> 00:49:40.044 region:rollup2
with the support of our assembly

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.311 region:rollup2
members that are here. To really

00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:42.179 region:rollup2
reverse.

00:49:40.311 --> 00:49:43.781 region:rollup2
Some adjust the perverse

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:46.016 region:rollup2
patterns.

00:49:43.781 --> 00:49:46.650 region:rollup2
Of of inequity that we see that

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:48.085 region:rollup2
impacting boys and men of color

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.686 region:rollup2
and education lose going to

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:49.854 region:rollup2
start. And then I'm going to

00:49:48.686 --> 00:49:52.256 region:rollup2
pick up after.

00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:53.958 region:rollup2
So we have a lot of different

00:49:52.256 --> 00:49:54.592 region:rollup2
projects going on in terms of

00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:55.993 region:rollup2
research that we're doing with

00:49:54.592 --> 00:49:56.594 region:rollup2
one just highlight to that we

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.862 region:rollup2
felt were practically relevant

00:49:56.594 --> 00:49:58.195 region:rollup2
here.

00:49:57.862 --> 00:50:00.064 region:rollup2
First with.

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:02.166 region:rollup2
Doing a lot of work looking

00:50:00.064 --> 00:50:04.134 region:rollup2
statewide at men of color

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.501 region:rollup2
including housing insecurities

00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:06.170 region:rollup2
was of mines.

00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.972 region:rollup2
With the previous comments but

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.372 region:rollup2
specifically looking at

00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:10.040 region:rollup2
community colleges

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:11.942 region:rollup2
if we think about. Of post

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.543 region:rollup2
secondary education the vast

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:15.813 region:rollup2
majority of our men of color

00:50:12.543 --> 00:50:16.380 region:rollup2
concentrated not in.

00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:18.115 region:rollup2
Places like San Diego State

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.884 region:rollup2
University or any of the UC's

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:22.186 region:rollup2
our in our communicative.

00:50:19.884 --> 00:50:22.720 region:rollup2
So it serves as a primary

00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:23.921 region:rollup2
pathway to post secondary

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.123 region:rollup2
education.

00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:27.825 region:rollup2
Unfortunately like many others

00:50:26.123 --> 00:50:29.927 region:rollup2
educational institutions.

00:50:27.825 --> 00:50:31.795 region:rollup2
There access is not always

00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:32.429 region:rollup2
synonymous with their success so

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:33.831 region:rollup2
it committee called the struggle

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:34.398 region:rollup2
to be able to do that.

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:36.100 region:rollup2
A one of the reasons that we

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:37.835 region:rollup2
see.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:38.502 region:rollup2
At one of the factors that we

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:40.304 region:rollup2
see is influencing their success

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:41.972 region:rollup2
is up food insecurity housing of

00:50:40.304 --> 00:50:42.539 region:rollup2
security.

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:44.174 region:rollup2
So in our most recent report

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:45.976 region:rollup2
the.

00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:47.978 region:rollup2
We had come out.

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:49.880 region:rollup2
We found that nearly.

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:51.849 region:rollup2
Twenty three percent.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.817 region:rollup2
Of black males

00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:54.451 region:rollup2
struggle with food insecurity

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.853 region:rollup2
now there's different types in

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:58.122 region:rollup2
ways that that can be measured.

00:50:55.853 --> 00:50:59.924 region:rollup2
About lot we look at

00:50:58.122 --> 00:51:00.424 region:rollup2
specifically it our work is the

00:50:59.924 --> 00:51:02.259 region:rollup2
most acute form of food

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:04.261 region:rollup2
insecurity so students who. Are

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.662 region:rollup2
struggling with where they got

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:06.463 region:rollup2
what they money.

00:51:04.662 --> 00:51:07.131 region:rollup2
And there's different ways in

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:07.965 region:rollup2
which is measure but we look at

00:51:07.131 --> 00:51:11.969 region:rollup2
the most acute form.

00:51:07.965 --> 00:51:12.570 region:rollup2
So we have about you know again

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:14.238 region:rollup2
to it twenty three percent so

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:16.140 region:rollup2
nearly a quarter. Who struggle

00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:17.975 region:rollup2
with that challenge we look at

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.609 region:rollup2
housing and security which can

00:51:17.975 --> 00:51:19.910 region:rollup2
include a wide array of things

00:51:18.609 --> 00:51:21.979 region:rollup2
to come?

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.580 region:rollup2
Some was student whose

00:51:21.979 --> 00:51:24.348 region:rollup2
couchsurfing Suguna Karsavina

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:26.216 region:rollup2
closet in some sort of untenable

00:51:24.348 --> 00:51:27.985 region:rollup2
living situation we're looking

00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:30.321 region:rollup2
at forty eight percent.

00:51:27.985 --> 00:51:32.222 region:rollup2
So there's a number of reasons

00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:33.958 region:rollup2
why does rates are so high.

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:36.160 region:rollup2
But they are very high those

00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:38.362 region:rollup2
issues are also typically.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:40.130 region:rollup2
Aligned with other challenges

00:51:38.362 --> 00:51:40.731 region:rollup2
we know that for for example

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.032 region:rollup2
students who experienced food

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:44.368 region:rollup2
insecurity.

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:46.070 region:rollup2
Seventy five percent of them

00:51:44.368 --> 00:51:46.737 region:rollup2
three quarters are also an

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.405 region:rollup2
experience housing and security.

00:51:46.737 --> 00:51:48.939 region:rollup2
To also very likely been

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:50.007 region:rollup2
experience transportation

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.641 region:rollup2
challenges

00:51:50.007 --> 00:51:51.909 region:rollup2
as well as a major employment

00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:54.345 region:rollup2
barriers

00:51:51.909 --> 00:51:56.046 region:rollup2
so you're talking about a

00:51:54.345 --> 00:51:56.647 region:rollup2
population that is experiencing

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:58.382 region:rollup2
pretty significant challenges

00:51:56.647 --> 00:52:00.150 region:rollup2
and one of the. Things that we

00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:02.119 region:rollup2
do is we go around we talk with

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.720 region:rollup2
a lot of educators about what

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.321 region:rollup2
they can do to better support

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.923 region:rollup2
their success. And a lot of it

00:52:04.321 --> 00:52:07.925 region:rollup2
begins with perception

00:52:05.923 --> 00:52:08.559 region:rollup2
stay a an educated much Houston

00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:09.960 region:rollup2
and back and the classroom comes

00:52:08.559 --> 00:52:12.062 region:rollup2
in a little bit late.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.663 region:rollup2
You know we know that student

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:14.198 region:rollup2
may have all these different

00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:16.166 region:rollup2
things going on and their very

00:52:14.198 --> 00:52:16.734 region:rollup2
presence demonstrates their

00:52:16.166 --> 00:52:18.168 region:rollup2
resilience and the fact that

00:52:16.734 --> 00:52:20.204 region:rollup2
they're committed in they care.

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.871 region:rollup2
The educators sees them I like

00:52:20.204 --> 00:52:22.406 region:rollup2
seeing. Their always like their

00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:24.041 region:rollup2
lazy they don't care they're

00:52:22.406 --> 00:52:24.642 region:rollup2
only here for the financial aid

00:52:24.041 --> 00:52:26.443 region:rollup2
so allowed where we deal with

00:52:24.642 --> 00:52:28.112 region:rollup2
our issues of. Perception of

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:29.980 region:rollup2
barriers.

00:52:28.112 --> 00:52:30.681 region:rollup2
The other thing one mention

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.914 region:rollup2
there's a report that we've been

00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:32.483 region:rollup2
doing.

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:34.385 region:rollup2
That's going to come out. In

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:36.387 region:rollup2
February so very soon that's a

00:52:34.385 --> 00:52:38.355 region:rollup2
partnership between our center

00:52:36.387 --> 00:52:40.224 region:rollup2
the seal commute because equity

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:42.026 region:rollup2
assessment lab. And blackmail

00:52:40.224 --> 00:52:43.994 region:rollup2
institute well what Tyrone how

00:52:42.026 --> 00:52:45.996 region:rollup2
did you silly looking at this.

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.664 region:rollup2
In case twelve in California I

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:47.998 region:rollup2
know this probably lot of folks

00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:50.000 region:rollup2
near done work around.

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:52.169 region:rollup2
Exclusionary discipline issues

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.870 region:rollup2
in general they fall into two

00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:54.171 region:rollup2
different categories in terms of

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.140 region:rollup2
exclusionary discipline students

00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:56.673 region:rollup2
or suspended. And score out of

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.042 region:rollup2
school or students who are

00:52:56.673 --> 00:53:00.277 region:rollup2
expelled.

00:52:58.042 --> 00:53:02.046 region:rollup2
We are been looking at

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:04.014 region:rollup2
statewide data.

00:53:02.046 --> 00:53:04.682 region:rollup2
And we see that of the statewide

00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:06.350 region:rollup2
average for suspensions is three

00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:06.917 region:rollup2
point six percent. For black

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:10.120 region:rollup2
males its twelve point eight

00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:10.721 region:rollup2
percent.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.222 region:rollup2
The highest disparity if we

00:53:10.721 --> 00:53:12.823 region:rollup2
start looking at different

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:14.391 region:rollup2
levels so those who are early

00:53:12.823 --> 00:53:16.326 region:rollup2
childhood or middle school and

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:18.195 region:rollup2
high school. Is actually in

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.829 region:rollup2
early childhood where they are

00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.064 region:rollup2
five point six times more likely

00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:22.599 region:rollup2
to be suspended.

00:53:20.064 --> 00:53:24.201 region:rollup2
We also know that when we start

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:26.070 region:rollup2
doing to segregation's we see

00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:26.704 region:rollup2
really high rates among those

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:28.105 region:rollup2
who are foster you. Those who

00:53:26.704 --> 00:53:30.441 region:rollup2
are homeless.

00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:32.476 region:rollup2
And we also in our report tried

00:53:30.441 --> 00:53:34.578 region:rollup2
to identify places where this is

00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:36.447 region:rollup2
occurring so. If we're thinking

00:53:34.578 --> 00:53:38.282 region:rollup2
about how total suspension

00:53:36.447 --> 00:53:38.782 region:rollup2
numbers behinds places are

00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:40.084 region:rollup2
usually are large urban

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:42.052 region:rollup2
counties.

00:53:40.084 --> 00:53:44.054 region:rollup2
So we're thinking about places

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:46.090 region:rollup2
such as Los Angeles Sacramento

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.690 region:rollup2
county San Bernardino county.

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:48.358 region:rollup2
But if we think about heists

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.327 region:rollup2
expansion rates it actually

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:52.062 region:rollup2
occurs in rural counties where

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:54.298 region:rollup2
there's less rep representation

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:56.266 region:rollup2
of. Of black males and the more

00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:56.567 region:rollup2
likely to be isolated and have

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:58.469 region:rollup2
experiences

00:53:56.567 --> 00:54:02.139 region:rollup2
where based upon these rates are

00:53:58.469 --> 00:54:04.475 region:rollup2
being clearly being targeted.

00:54:02.139 --> 00:54:06.343 region:rollup2
Yeah so we're regard to

00:54:04.475 --> 00:54:08.312 region:rollup2
recommendations are you know

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.745 region:rollup2
they're December that we thought

00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:10.414 region:rollup2
of first to address

00:54:08.745 --> 00:54:10.981 region:rollup2
recommendations related to food

00:54:10.414 --> 00:54:12.149 region:rollup2
housing and securities thank

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.084 region:rollup2
you.

00:54:12.149 --> 00:54:14.751 region:rollup2
Are we have to continue to

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:16.520 region:rollup2
invest in the community colleges

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:18.122 region:rollup2
first and foremost recognizing

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.756 region:rollup2
that.

00:54:18.122 --> 00:54:20.324 region:rollup2
For boys and men of color it's

00:54:18.756 --> 00:54:22.126 region:rollup2
the primary pathway to a

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:22.659 region:rollup2
bachelor back to.

00:54:22.126 --> 00:54:24.128 region:rollup2
That you know without that

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:26.396 region:rollup2
investment.

00:54:24.128 --> 00:54:30.200 region:rollup2
You know the students are not

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:30.667 region:rollup2
necessarily going into see

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.169 region:rollup2
issues are you see S.

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.769 region:rollup2
attentions.

00:54:32.169 --> 00:54:34.438 region:rollup2
If they're access in those

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:36.140 region:rollup2
institutions it's through to

00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:38.275 region:rollup2
transfer so have to concede

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.942 region:rollup2
invest are the equity. By the

00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:40.577 region:rollup2
side of invest been invested a

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:42.513 region:rollup2
committee colleges over the last

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:44.448 region:rollup2
couple years has done a lot to

00:54:42.513 --> 00:54:45.115 region:rollup2
address concerns like food and

00:54:44.448 --> 00:54:46.216 region:rollup2
housing insecurities among other

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:48.452 region:rollup2
things.

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:50.154 region:rollup2
So we opted to can you continue

00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:52.222 region:rollup2
to see that as a worthwhile

00:54:50.154 --> 00:54:52.789 region:rollup2
investment. In our state are

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:54.591 region:rollup2
will serve to think about.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:56.560 region:rollup2
Investing with regard to

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:58.262 region:rollup2
facilities in committee colleges

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.464 region:rollup2
of things like residents halls

00:54:58.262 --> 00:55:02.232 region:rollup2
meal programs childcare things

00:55:00.464 --> 00:55:04.268 region:rollup2
that can help reduce the cost.

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:06.537 region:rollup2
Of attending college but also

00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:06.737 region:rollup2
to help students meet other

00:55:06.537 --> 00:55:08.472 region:rollup2
needs

00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:10.374 region:rollup2
that impact their ability to to

00:55:08.472 --> 00:55:11.008 region:rollup2
access I'm affordable food in

00:55:10.374 --> 00:55:14.244 region:rollup2
affordable housing given things

00:55:11.008 --> 00:55:14.878 region:rollup2
like have been free meals on.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:15.546 region:rollup2
But think about our K. twelve

00:55:14.878 --> 00:55:17.347 region:rollup2
schools we have free and reduced

00:55:15.546 --> 00:55:19.416 region:rollup2
lunch programs.

00:55:17.347 --> 00:55:21.318 region:rollup2
You think about how might that

00:55:19.416 --> 00:55:21.919 region:rollup2
that same same type of.

00:55:21.318 --> 00:55:23.320 region:rollup2
Program be implemented and a

00:55:21.919 --> 00:55:25.422 region:rollup2
post secondary level.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:27.558 region:rollup2
Again would regard to the

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:29.293 region:rollup2
suspension concerns that lieu

00:55:27.558 --> 00:55:31.361 region:rollup2
talked about intensive ongoing

00:55:29.293 --> 00:55:31.995 region:rollup2
professor development for the

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:33.564 region:rollup2
our teachers in our state is

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:37.334 region:rollup2
absolutely critical. Are so much

00:55:33.564 --> 00:55:38.001 region:rollup2
of these disparities relates to

00:55:37.334 --> 00:55:39.636 region:rollup2
things like on crutches bias and

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.270 region:rollup2
things like racial micro

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:41.371 region:rollup2
aggressions so we talked a lot

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.407 region:rollup2
about.

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:44.074 region:rollup2
You know that as it relates to

00:55:43.407 --> 00:55:45.442 region:rollup2
life force where we have to have

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:47.477 region:rollup2
the same conversations about

00:55:45.442 --> 00:55:47.744 region:rollup2
weight what occurred within

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:49.847 region:rollup2
schools.

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:51.481 region:rollup2
But we have to consider look at

00:55:49.847 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
data and use data to inform

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:53.817 region:rollup2
drive these conversations as

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:55.852 region:rollup2
well. I don't think about some.

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:59.356 region:rollup2
You know statewide task force

00:55:55.852 --> 00:56:01.592 region:rollup2
to focus exclusively on.

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:02.192 region:rollup2
Spigen expulsion at other types

00:56:01.592 --> 00:56:03.393 region:rollup2
of exclusionary disciplinary

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.395 region:rollup2
programs.

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:07.364 region:rollup2
So with that.

00:56:05.395 --> 00:56:08.031 region:rollup2
We're going to concluding allow

00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:09.399 region:rollup2
other colleagues to share their

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:09.933 region:rollup2
remarks and hopefully have some

00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:10.267 region:rollup2
twenty four questions and

00:56:09.933 --> 00:56:23.447 region:rollup2
dialogue that

00:56:10.267 --> 00:56:25.849 region:rollup2
much.

00:56:23.447 --> 00:56:27.751 region:rollup2
Thank you I have twenty pages of

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:29.419 region:rollup2
notes that probably won't talk

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:33.423 region:rollup2
about anything I wrote down.

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:34.024 region:rollup2
I want a survey thing no.

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:35.525 region:rollup2
I was really excited when I

00:56:34.024 --> 00:56:37.594 region:rollup2
pulled into the parking lot and

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:38.095 region:rollup2
I saw reserve that make I

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.429 region:rollup2
thought it was for me.

00:56:38.095 --> 00:56:41.398 region:rollup2
.

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:43.734 region:rollup2
And the other was a young man

00:56:41.398 --> 00:56:44.301 region:rollup2
next to me and our cities this

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:45.802 region:rollup2
when we park on one of the

00:56:44.301 --> 00:56:46.236 region:rollup2
speakers is it dollars solely

00:56:45.802 --> 00:56:49.473 region:rollup2
for the politician.

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:50.107 region:rollup2
.

00:56:49.473 --> 00:56:51.475 region:rollup2
Swimming next about how reserve

00:56:50.107 --> 00:56:53.777 region:rollup2
spot.

00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:55.612 region:rollup2
I'm kidding I'm I don't need a

00:56:53.777 --> 00:56:55.746 region:rollup2
reserve spy I'm I'm good.

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:55.879 region:rollup2
.

00:56:55.746 --> 00:56:59.483 region:rollup2
I.

00:56:55.879 --> 00:57:01.618 region:rollup2
.

00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:03.553 region:rollup2
I always like to start with with

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.887 region:rollup2
some humor less just part of who

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
I am. And.

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:07.958 region:rollup2
In our in our native.

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:09.459 region:rollup2
You're talking about the

00:57:07.958 --> 00:57:10.027 region:rollup2
reservation in our native.

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:11.461 region:rollup2
American ways of seeing the

00:57:10.027 --> 00:57:13.430 region:rollup2
world.

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:15.499 region:rollup2
Humor is

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:17.467 region:rollup2
sacred medicine.

00:57:15.499 --> 00:57:19.469 region:rollup2
Without it we we just

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:19.803 region:rollup2
find more difficulty to function

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:21.872 region:rollup2
in life nam.

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:23.874 region:rollup2
Both of my brothers went to jail

00:57:21.872 --> 00:57:25.509 region:rollup2
my father went to jail stuff for

00:57:23.874 --> 00:57:27.711 region:rollup2
males I'm the one that.

00:57:25.509 --> 00:57:29.513 region:rollup2
And we went for a night.

00:57:27.711 --> 00:57:31.515 region:rollup2
.

00:57:29.513 --> 00:57:31.815 region:rollup2
None to my brothers.

00:57:31.515 --> 00:57:33.717 region:rollup2
Finished.

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:35.719 region:rollup2
The ninth grade. When I got out

00:57:33.717 --> 00:57:37.688 region:rollup2
of high school I had a fourth

00:57:35.719 --> 00:57:39.456 region:rollup2
grade reading level had a fourth

00:57:37.688 --> 00:57:41.625 region:rollup2
grade math level.

00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:43.760 region:rollup2
Super long story short I finally

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:44.394 region:rollup2
changed my life like turn my

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.529 region:rollup2
life around I went to college I

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:47.731 region:rollup2
graduated from you.

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:49.633 region:rollup2
Steel is an honor roll student

00:57:47.731 --> 00:57:51.535 region:rollup2
ash and even know what honor

00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:52.135 region:rollup2
roll was when they sent me a

00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:53.570 region:rollup2
little paper set out on a real

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:54.137 region:rollup2
student.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.572 region:rollup2
And you know what that was.

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:57.574 region:rollup2
.

00:57:55.572 --> 00:58:01.578 region:rollup2
So.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:02.012 region:rollup2
I think that's what begin.

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.814 region:rollup2
The work that our.

00:58:02.012 --> 00:58:05.649 region:rollup2
I'm not gonna say me because

00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:06.216 region:rollup2
there's a lot of people that

00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.551 region:rollup2
that did this work that we

00:58:06.216 --> 00:58:09.886 region:rollup2
started doing in the community.

00:58:07.551 --> 00:58:11.922 region:rollup2
For many many years with that

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:13.623 region:rollup2
putting get any funding and. I

00:58:11.922 --> 00:58:15.559 region:rollup2
know a lot of you in this room

00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:17.694 region:rollup2
are in the same situation.

00:58:15.559 --> 00:58:19.596 region:rollup2
With a give money to take kids

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:21.798 region:rollup2
through the reservation from the

00:58:19.596 --> 00:58:23.767 region:rollup2
city or are we start a rite of

00:58:21.798 --> 00:58:24.334 region:rollup2
passage ceremony it's over

00:58:23.767 --> 00:58:27.604 region:rollup2
twenty two years now that we

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:28.238 region:rollup2
have liberty a rites of passage.

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.873 region:rollup2
We know everybody in this room

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:31.608 region:rollup2
knows that that we all go

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:32.142 region:rollup2
through rights of passage in our

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.577 region:rollup2
lives we go through them.

00:58:32.142 --> 00:58:35.912 region:rollup2
Different stages

00:58:33.577 --> 00:58:37.581 region:rollup2
so we provide a healthy rites of

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:39.850 region:rollup2
passage with our young men.

00:58:37.581 --> 00:58:41.551 region:rollup2
The young Chicano boys and some

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:42.052 region:rollup2
of the African American boys we

00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:42.652 region:rollup2
literally taken to the

00:58:42.052 --> 00:58:43.587 region:rollup2
reservation for three days as

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:45.756 region:rollup2
there.

00:58:43.587 --> 00:58:47.657 region:rollup2
Finishing their rights of

00:58:45.756 --> 00:58:49.593 region:rollup2
passage they get a crazy Nick

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:51.795 region:rollup2
name just like because that's

00:58:49.593 --> 00:58:53.597 region:rollup2
what we have to do. Is get crazy

00:58:51.795 --> 00:58:55.932 region:rollup2
nicknames arm.

00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:57.868 region:rollup2
But I think everybody's been

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:59.770 region:rollup2
talking about it is my the love

00:58:57.868 --> 00:58:59.970 region:rollup2
this song the of.

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.039 region:rollup2
Was.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
Over my classes here the.

00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:05.809 region:rollup2
.

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:07.944 region:rollup2
Post traumatic stress disorder

00:59:05.809 --> 00:59:09.679 region:rollup2
right I love that. And dom I

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:13.550 region:rollup2
think one of the things.

00:59:09.679 --> 00:59:15.619 region:rollup2
Is helping them understand.

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:17.687 region:rollup2
Why their disengage helping them

00:59:15.619 --> 00:59:18.321 region:rollup2
understand why they feel the way

00:59:17.687 --> 00:59:19.856 region:rollup2
they feel because young people

00:59:18.321 --> 00:59:21.892 region:rollup2
don't understand? Is that low

00:59:19.856 --> 00:59:22.225 region:rollup2
I'm stupid ó I'm this all on

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:23.660 region:rollup2
that is sick.

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:25.829 region:rollup2
We don't.

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.664 region:rollup2
We don't have to tell though my

00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:28.198 region:rollup2
their disengage.

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:29.966 region:rollup2
The key is to help them

00:59:28.198 --> 00:59:31.668 region:rollup2
understand why this and they

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.302 region:rollup2
disengage

00:59:31.668 --> 00:59:33.703 region:rollup2
I had a student a couple days

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:35.605 region:rollup2
ago so I need anger management.

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:38.041 region:rollup2
Okay what is acre.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:39.609 region:rollup2
Well I don't know what is anger.

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:40.210 region:rollup2
Paying.

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:41.945 region:rollup2
Okay what is pains other and

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.880 region:rollup2
they just start they break it

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:45.615 region:rollup2
down themselves they start

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.183 region:rollup2
realizing that.

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.984 region:rollup2
They don't have to blame

00:59:46.183 --> 00:59:49.586 region:rollup2
themselves that generational

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:52.022 region:rollup2
trauma. And and.

00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:53.723 region:rollup2
Young people to start learning

00:59:52.022 --> 00:59:55.792 region:rollup2
this it may th grade and sixth

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:57.861 region:rollup2
grade seventh grade we can start

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:58.428 region:rollup2
healing no young men they don't

00:59:57.861 --> 00:59:59.963 region:rollup2
have to go to a therapist.

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.765 region:rollup2
Every single time we could do it

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:02.432 region:rollup2
in a circle we could do it the

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.633 region:rollup2
way our answers of it too in a

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:05.769 region:rollup2
for.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:07.671 region:rollup2
About five thousand years you

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:09.673 region:rollup2
know who little bit before the

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:11.641 region:rollup2
war restorative justice came out

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:13.610 region:rollup2
restore circles.

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:14.244 region:rollup2
I'm so what I want and with this

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.745 region:rollup2
because I know my time going to

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:18.014 region:rollup2
come up soon. We know.

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:20.016 region:rollup2
That something happens to young

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:21.818 region:rollup2
men of color in the third and

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:22.452 region:rollup2
fourth grade we know by then we

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:23.620 region:rollup2
know that would have to get it

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.755 region:rollup2
to everybody here knows that.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:26.389 region:rollup2
So if we're going to start

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:29.626 region:rollup2
talking about initiatives we're

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:31.595 region:rollup2
start time of funding.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:33.797 region:rollup2
Imagine a real genuine one

01:00:31.595 --> 01:00:34.364 region:rollup2
hundred percent campaign that

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:37.801 region:rollup2
says you know what. There's

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:39.936 region:rollup2
something happening at this age.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:41.705 region:rollup2
Well I'm billboards bus shelters

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:42.205 region:rollup2
were weak genuinely are.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:44.207 region:rollup2
Going to the root of the

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:46.142 region:rollup2
problem.

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:47.978 region:rollup2
Which is something is happening

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:49.713 region:rollup2
in some of these brothers

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.815 region:rollup2
already mentioned.

01:00:49.713 --> 01:00:53.950 region:rollup2
Unconscious bias right.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:55.652 region:rollup2
It's genuinely there's teachers

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.654 region:rollup2
in a measures that are afraid of

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.255 region:rollup2
our young people they're afraid

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:00.223 region:rollup2
of me and it's like I don't

01:00:58.255 --> 01:01:00.423 region:rollup2
don't freak out I work here you

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.791 region:rollup2
know.

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:03.994 region:rollup2
.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.261 region:rollup2
Not the janitor but I I work

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:07.864 region:rollup2
here and.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:08.431 region:rollup2
So. That it's real I know like

01:01:07.864 --> 01:01:09.833 region:rollup2
it's that it's it's kinda

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:13.904 region:rollup2
humorous but it's real so.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:15.872 region:rollup2
Imagine a genuine campaign will

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:17.941 region:rollup2
we start really attacking the

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:18.575 region:rollup2
root root of the problem what's

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:20.143 region:rollup2
happening because the majority

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:20.744 region:rollup2
where a little boys are going to

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.845 region:rollup2
tell me they go to elementary

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.847 region:rollup2
school.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:26.182 region:rollup2
Something happens there.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:28.151 region:rollup2
I still have yet anybody to

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.819 region:rollup2
pinpoint what really really

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:31.855 region:rollup2
really happens.

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:33.823 region:rollup2
And I myself racked my brain

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.457 region:rollup2
trying to figure it out.

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.092 region:rollup2
I've talk to every scholar you

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:37.727 region:rollup2
could possibly imagine may give

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:40.030 region:rollup2
me different.

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:41.798 region:rollup2
Their ideas right but we have to

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.733 region:rollup2
all the brothers that are here

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:44.401 region:rollup2
today. This is less started

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.735 region:rollup2
committee let's really genuinely

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:47.871 region:rollup2
figure out what happens

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:48.538 region:rollup2
because that's it.

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:49.773 region:rollup2
The plant that seed that corns

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:52.142 region:rollup2
coming out of the ground and.

01:01:49.773 --> 01:01:53.944 region:rollup2
COR is not going to grow it's

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:55.845 region:rollup2
not growing so what would is it

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:56.446 region:rollup2
will kind of fertilizer do we

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.781 region:rollup2
need how much water does that

01:01:56.446 --> 01:02:00.116 region:rollup2
mean.

01:01:57.781 --> 01:02:00.617 region:rollup2
Right how close we have to have

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.185 region:rollup2
it away from the shape.

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:04.020 region:rollup2
We have to figure that out

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.354 region:rollup2
what's happening with their

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.755 region:rollup2
young men so.

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:07.857 region:rollup2
.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:09.826 region:rollup2
Like the like that other brother

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:10.293 region:rollup2
was say now he's around pastors

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:12.062 region:rollup2
around a lot. One the

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:13.964 region:rollup2
reservation we sit around our

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:15.865 region:rollup2
elders talk to three in the

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:17.901 region:rollup2
morning for four hours. And

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:19.803 region:rollup2
we're not allowed to move or not

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.871 region:rollup2
allowed to fall asleep.

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:23.807 region:rollup2
So believe me I could talk for a

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.441 region:rollup2
really long time is what's I'm

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:25.842 region:rollup2
used to that but thank you thank

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:31.848 region:rollup2
you.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:35.819 region:rollup2
Alright thank.

Good afternoon now.

First thank.

And.

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.626 region:rollup2
.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.327 region:rollup2
Give everyone here give yourself

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:49.966 region:rollup2
a hand of applause for all the

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:50.133 region:rollup2
great work you don't.

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:50.667 region:rollup2
And.

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:51.968 region:rollup2
Special shout out to the

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:55.972 region:rollup2
Californian down.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:56.573 region:rollup2
Mark Tran in the back for.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.974 region:rollup2
Being one of the one of that

01:02:56.573 --> 01:02:59.976 region:rollup2
honestly one of the best private

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:02.245 region:rollup2
foundations to take this.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:05.882 region:rollup2
Issue and make a top priority

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:06.449 region:rollup2
so.

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:09.853 region:rollup2
The California endowment and

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:13.857 region:rollup2
apply.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:14.457 region:rollup2
I wanna.

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:16.192 region:rollup2
My name is Sadat Ali and. I

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.861 region:rollup2
found it African coalition

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:18.495 region:rollup2
workforce to.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:21.965 region:rollup2
Foster economic growth and self

01:03:18.495 --> 01:03:22.599 region:rollup2
sufficiency.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.134 region:rollup2
Basically through you know.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:25.902 region:rollup2
Underserved populations so

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.904 region:rollup2
providing job training.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:29.906 region:rollup2
Employment placements.

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:30.507 region:rollup2
So we worked not mailing list.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.908 region:rollup2
Refugees and immigrants and

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:34.077 region:rollup2
city heights.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:34.644 region:rollup2
Will also get a lot of college

01:03:34.077 --> 01:03:37.914 region:rollup2
graduates that walking. With

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.548 region:rollup2
the.

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:40.183 region:rollup2
Don't teacher you know some of

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:41.885 region:rollup2
the basic life tools in college

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.519 region:rollup2
so.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
I'm as the issue alumni also.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:47.957 region:rollup2
.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:48.625 region:rollup2
So despite all the stuff that's

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:58.034 region:rollup2
going on in the news and in the

01:03:48.625 --> 01:04:01.971 region:rollup2
media take.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:04.007 region:rollup2
.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.240 region:rollup2
Special tabla boys and men of

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:07.977 region:rollup2
color.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.645 region:rollup2
Before while.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:09.045 region:rollup2
You know if they should with the

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:09.212 region:rollup2
law enforcement.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:11.981 region:rollup2
And.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:12.449 region:rollup2
.

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:12.949 region:rollup2
Forget about education

01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:15.919 region:rollup2
employment you have to.

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:16.553 region:rollup2
We

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:17.954 region:rollup2
what about how to survive in the

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:21.925 region:rollup2
street.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:22.559 region:rollup2
With the you know the P. T. S.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.960 region:rollup2
the you're taught what chairman

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.127 region:rollup2
Sawyer.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.363 region:rollup2
So.

01:04:24.127 --> 01:04:28.264 region:rollup2
There's a lot of issues when it

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:31.968 region:rollup2
comes to this population. And.

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:34.003 region:rollup2
That includes

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:36.272 region:rollup2
all of us that this panel.

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:36.506 region:rollup2
Clued myself I came I came to

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.974 region:rollup2
the US.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:40.009 region:rollup2
In the mid nineties

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:40.543 region:rollup2
at the age of nine years old.

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.011 region:rollup2
I don't speak one word of

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:44.013 region:rollup2
English.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.647 region:rollup2
.

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:46.015 region:rollup2
I was raised in a single file

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:47.984 region:rollup2
full pan.

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:49.986 region:rollup2
Single market.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:55.959 region:rollup2
With five other siblings.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:57.994 region:rollup2
So. You see lots of you know

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:59.996 region:rollup2
with the fair we all have.

01:04:57.994 --> 01:05:02.132 region:rollup2
.

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:04.033 region:rollup2
Boys and men of color majority

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:06.035 region:rollup2
wealth in a single households.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.503 region:rollup2
.

01:05:06.035 --> 01:05:08.071 region:rollup2
With with that said.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:10.039 region:rollup2
You know.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
I was very fortunate enough to

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:10.507 region:rollup2
beat the odds.

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.075 region:rollup2
.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:14.410 region:rollup2
Because of.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:15.011 region:rollup2
Likely my mom had a little bit

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.079 region:rollup2
of educational background from

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:18.314 region:rollup2
back home.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:20.250 region:rollup2
So the kids education is.

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:22.051 region:rollup2
If one of the main pathways to

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.619 region:rollup2
opportunity.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:24.053 region:rollup2
And this kind of the about

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:26.456 region:rollup2
education.

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:28.124 region:rollup2
I'm fortunate enough to work

01:05:26.456 --> 01:05:28.658 region:rollup2
with high school students right

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:30.059 region:rollup2
now providing help three

01:05:28.658 --> 01:05:30.593 region:rollup2
pathways.

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.061 region:rollup2
So local city heights high

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.228 region:rollup2
schools.

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:34.364 region:rollup2
We.

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:34.597 region:rollup2
Try to put the. Focus on.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:36.099 region:rollup2
And the.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:38.101 region:rollup2
.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:38.635 region:rollup2
Minority high school you.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:42.105 region:rollup2
Get them interested in the

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:42.639 region:rollup2
health field.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.306 region:rollup2
There's gonna be over two

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:44.107 region:rollup2
million health coverage jobs in

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:46.276 region:rollup2
the next ten years.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:48.111 region:rollup2
So stuff like alternative

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:50.413 region:rollup2
pathways.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.047 region:rollup2
Where? We can go to post

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.048 region:rollup2
secondary that only a four year

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:54.083 region:rollup2
degree.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.551 region:rollup2
That only two.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.319 region:rollup2
Given the options and

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:58.421 region:rollup2
educational when I say Hey there

01:05:56.319 --> 01:06:00.089 region:rollup2
are other schools they can have

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:02.091 region:rollup2
to succeed in life.

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:02.725 region:rollup2
.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:05.962 region:rollup2
And that's the thanks to the

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:06.529 region:rollup2
support the Californian down

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:06.963 region:rollup2
some of the great stuff they

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:07.130 region:rollup2
don't need city I.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.097 region:rollup2
And.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:12.135 region:rollup2
.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:12.735 region:rollup2
So basically it's it's.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.137 region:rollup2
Does a whole lot of money out

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:16.039 region:rollup2
there.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:18.575 region:rollup2
.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:18.775 region:rollup2
A lot of money to send a was

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.477 region:rollup2
well.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:20.677 region:rollup2
But not too many things being

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:24.047 region:rollup2
done.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:26.149 region:rollup2
Terms of.

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:30.253 region:rollup2
You know there's two minarets a.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:30.820 region:rollup2
Politics as usual. Out you know

01:06:30.253 --> 01:06:32.121 region:rollup2
let's be honest little of

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.257 region:rollup2
ourselves if if.

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.757 region:rollup2
We have the local workforce

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:36.493 region:rollup2
development of region.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.726 region:rollup2
Was a lot of money that can

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:38.127 region:rollup2
easily.

01:06:36.726 --> 01:06:40.497 region:rollup2
You know.

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:40.997 region:rollup2
Fund so many of these great

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:44.067 region:rollup2
projects in this from.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:44.300 region:rollup2
.

01:06:44.067 --> 01:06:46.636 region:rollup2
You know

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.204 region:rollup2
state politics as usual federal

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:50.240 region:rollup2
is even worse.

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:52.208 region:rollup2
So there are them the monies out

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.544 region:rollup2
there will need to keep.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:56.479 region:rollup2
Talk about so many hands and and

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:57.080 region:rollup2
and and nam and bring in the

01:06:56.479 --> 01:07:00.216 region:rollup2
south you know. Months after

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.850 region:rollup2
months.

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:02.151 region:rollup2
It's just about how do we align.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.153 region:rollup2
Some of these great

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.821 region:rollup2
recommendations that were

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:08.091 region:rollup2
brought up here at this hearing.

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:08.691 region:rollup2
Which includes.

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:10.193 region:rollup2
Staying in the career path we

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.593 region:rollup2
trust.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.195 region:rollup2
Who state level?

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:12.762 region:rollup2
That's one.

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:14.063 region:rollup2
Recommendation that's really

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:16.232 region:rollup2
helpful

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:18.234 region:rollup2
specially career. After

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:20.136 region:rollup2
opportunity.

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:20.703 region:rollup2
How do we?

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.238 region:rollup2
Leverage the local workforce

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:24.140 region:rollup2
dollars.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:26.576 region:rollup2
In the community.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:28.144 region:rollup2
The the we abolish the federal

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:30.146 region:rollup2
funds.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.713 region:rollup2
For this young man.

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:32.148 region:rollup2
Things twenty four year old

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.615 region:rollup2
will.

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:36.119 region:rollup2
And at the same time.

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:36.719 region:rollup2
You know.

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.221 region:rollup2
Developing high agreements in

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.123 region:rollup2
the region.

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.623 region:rollup2
So a lot of these employers.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:42.125 region:rollup2
For taking advantage of

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:44.127 region:rollup2
subsidies.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:46.429 region:rollup2
Given employer subsidy.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:50.166 region:rollup2
Subsidized terms of high boys

01:07:46.429 --> 01:07:52.235 region:rollup2
and men of color.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.869 region:rollup2
And it seems on. We can also

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.170 region:rollup2
take. That affect couple months

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:56.573 region:rollup2
ago.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:58.174 region:rollup2
County of San Diego the mental

01:07:56.573 --> 01:08:00.376 region:rollup2
health services that.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:02.178 region:rollup2
Has a lot of money over twenty

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:06.182 region:rollup2
million thousand reservists.

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:06.849 region:rollup2
Hasn't been touched for years.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.317 region:rollup2
And will you talk on a matter

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:10.186 region:rollup2
health issues and this

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:12.589 region:rollup2
population.

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:16.192 region:rollup2
You come out lack of employment

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:18.194 region:rollup2
if somewhat educational gap.

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:20.196 region:rollup2
It's almost decided pressure.

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:20.830 region:rollup2
Someone law enforcement.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:22.198 region:rollup2
Portsmouth to others not be part

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:24.200 region:rollup2
of it.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.734 region:rollup2
So the mental health services

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.235 region:rollup2
act that could be another

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:26.803 region:rollup2
component.

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.237 region:rollup2
Dollars that can be used in

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:28.805 region:rollup2
terms of.

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.239 region:rollup2
And we talked about it with

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:32.208 region:rollup2
county level.

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.642 region:rollup2
In terms of workforce

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.243 region:rollup2
development creating

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:38.214 region:rollup2
opportunities.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:38.815 region:rollup2
So and at the same time going

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:39.282 region:rollup2
you know short term program

01:08:38.815 --> 01:08:42.218 region:rollup2
certificate programs.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:44.620 region:rollup2
.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:45.121 region:rollup2
I want to community college

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.222 region:rollup2
myself and it was really

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.224 region:rollup2
helpful.

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:50.526 region:rollup2
I think.

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:51.060 region:rollup2
With these to professors with

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:54.230 region:rollup2
their don't section one.

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.232 region:rollup2
Community colleges.

01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:56.799 region:rollup2
One the folks on that in terms

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.100 region:rollup2
of giving them the resources

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:58.267 region:rollup2
they need.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.104 region:rollup2
And.

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:01.637 region:rollup2
Making sure because a lot of

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:04.140 region:rollup2
young men of color bone.

01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:05.842 region:rollup2
Too many colleges right now

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.910 region:rollup2
which is the right way to. Kind

01:09:05.842 --> 01:09:09.779 region:rollup2
of figure yourself out before he

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:10.313 region:rollup2
entered the you know.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:11.781 region:rollup2
Crazy four year world.

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:12.181 region:rollup2
Universities and stuff.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.783 region:rollup2
So with that said.

01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:15.985 region:rollup2
.

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:16.586 region:rollup2
Very fortunate to be here and

01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:21.758 region:rollup2
well I think everybody. Thank

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:24.027 region:rollup2
you.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:28.097 region:rollup2
We're now joined by the assembly

01:09:24.027 --> 01:09:28.598 region:rollup2
member Dr Weber on a fiscally

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.799 region:rollup2
ducked were more likely

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:32.168 region:rollup2
assembly.

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:33.803 region:rollup2
One they think person same

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:34.237 region:rollup2
person.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:35.805 region:rollup2
Would you like to.

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:38.207 region:rollup2
Say a few words.

01:09:35.805 --> 01:09:40.076 region:rollup2
Now just double you know.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:41.811 region:rollup2
One assumes that what is in

01:09:40.076 --> 01:09:43.913 region:rollup2
your hometown is easy to get to.

01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:45.848 region:rollup2
A and that it's not because

01:09:43.913 --> 01:09:46.449 region:rollup2
people assume that you're in the

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.817 region:rollup2
city so they keep one to meet

01:09:46.449 --> 01:09:49.919 region:rollup2
with you. But I'm I'm pleased to

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:51.988 region:rollup2
be here today and I one thing my

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:53.856 region:rollup2
staff and and Mister. Jones

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:56.125 region:rollup2
Sawyer staff organizing this

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:59.929 region:rollup2
item off the chancellor has been

01:09:56.125 --> 01:10:02.065 region:rollup2
by Constance hero via I met with

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:04.067 region:rollup2
her earlier. At noon and she was

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:06.202 region:rollup2
telling she's gonna come by and

01:10:04.067 --> 01:10:07.970 region:rollup2
that she was very on it that you

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:10.106 region:rollup2
were in one of their facilities.

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:12.008 region:rollup2
We have an amazing community

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:14.243 region:rollup2
college here in San Diego and

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:16.379 region:rollup2
great leadership and so on as a

01:10:14.243 --> 01:10:18.147 region:rollup2
young man was talking about his

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:20.283 region:rollup2
experience. Clearly.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:22.218 region:rollup2
It's a reflection of the

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:24.253 region:rollup2
tremendous leadership that

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:26.222 region:rollup2
exists in San Diego but I'm just

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:28.124 region:rollup2
pleased to hear this is an

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:30.326 region:rollup2
important committee.

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:33.996 region:rollup2
That meets regularly and the

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:35.965 region:rollup2
issues are important and many of

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:38.034 region:rollup2
the issues have actually.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:40.002 region:rollup2
Translated into legislation and

01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:42.305 region:rollup2
that's what's important I

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:46.242 region:rollup2
sometimes we think these are

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:48.511 region:rollup2
just committees that meet will

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:50.480 region:rollup2
talk and meet and talk.

01:10:48.511 --> 01:10:51.080 region:rollup2
But they don't miss Jones

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.748 region:rollup2
Sawyer in and private cheers

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.316 region:rollup2
have taken the recommendations

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:54.784 region:rollup2
and translated them into.

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:56.753 region:rollup2
Legislation and oftentimes the

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:57.253 region:rollup2
legislation is a in the house in

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.821 region:rollup2
the assembly of various

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.556 region:rollup2
committees members of the

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:01.190 region:rollup2
commission will respond to. The

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.724 region:rollup2
legislation is how it's going to

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:06.496 region:rollup2
affect I know most of our

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:08.498 region:rollup2
cultures.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:10.600 region:rollup2
Many of you talked about.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:12.535 region:rollup2
As you grow up become other

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:16.639 region:rollup2
young men young woman you.

01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:18.508 region:rollup2
Whether after American African.

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:19.075 region:rollup2
Native American or EP I will

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:20.543 region:rollup2
seem to have these rites of

01:11:19.075 --> 01:11:21.210 region:rollup2
passage.

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:22.645 region:rollup2
Unfortunately right now to write

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:23.279 region:rollup2
the patches.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:23.913 region:rollup2
Or with gang members and drug

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.549 region:rollup2
dealers and they have their own

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:27.183 region:rollup2
rights.

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:30.586 region:rollup2
I even when we had our native

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:31.154 region:rollup2
American.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.522 region:rollup2
Hearing a talk about sweat

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:36.659 region:rollup2
lodges.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:37.260 region:rollup2
And I was all gung ho ready to

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.628 region:rollup2
go to find out it's seven days

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.630 region:rollup2
no food.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:42.632 region:rollup2
Water and year.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:45.134 region:rollup2
It is pretty rough and so on.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:46.636 region:rollup2
DESY boil the sense it would

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:48.838 region:rollup2
probably need to read

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:50.740 region:rollup2
figure that before but I I do

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:52.742 region:rollup2
that and now I hear you have to

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:54.710 region:rollup2
listen to your elders to three

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:54.944 region:rollup2
o'clock at morning. Can't go to

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:58.681 region:rollup2
sleep.

01:11:54.944 --> 01:12:00.683 region:rollup2
But this whole thing of before.

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:02.652 region:rollup2
Just whole school system promote

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:04.654 region:rollup2
justice systems society.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:07.123 region:rollup2
Racism hit you.

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:07.690 region:rollup2
Back them before you went out to

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:10.660 region:rollup2
the force before you start

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:14.564 region:rollup2
hunting before you.

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:17.800 region:rollup2
We cannot put mentally prepared.

01:12:14.564 --> 01:12:18.434 region:rollup2
Our young people to to be able

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.102 region:rollup2
to handle that by sitting with

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:22.104 region:rollup2
your elders are.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:22.738 region:rollup2
Or for others.

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.106 region:rollup2
I've always wondered if we ever

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:26.242 region:rollup2
could.

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:28.377 region:rollup2
Recreate something like that so

01:12:26.242 --> 01:12:30.112 region:rollup2
that when what is third grade.

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:32.515 region:rollup2
We go look a camp.

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:33.115 region:rollup2
You know what they're not read

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.150 region:rollup2
that third grade level we need

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:36.385 region:rollup2
to stop.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:38.354 region:rollup2
And get back or you know they're

01:12:36.385 --> 01:12:40.223 region:rollup2
there which means a whole lot of

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:40.690 region:rollup2
problem we need trauma we need

01:12:40.223 --> 01:12:42.491 region:rollup2
to stop and no start.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.193 region:rollup2
Dealing with that or as you city

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:46.729 region:rollup2
need housing they're hungry

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:49.232 region:rollup2
it is that something.

01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:49.865 region:rollup2
That.

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.267 region:rollup2
Possibly put together a few.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:53.236 region:rollup2
To.

01:12:51.267 --> 01:12:56.305 region:rollup2
To to maybe start is healing

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:56.939 region:rollup2
because as doctor Weber said and

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:59.141 region:rollup2
many of you said. We've had a

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.475 region:rollup2
lot of hearing. And we've done a

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.142 region:rollup2
lot of things

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:00.977 region:rollup2
and now we need to start putting

01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:05.047 region:rollup2
things inaction.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:05.715 region:rollup2
After me hopefully the. The

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.116 region:rollup2
subsequent chairs and subsequent

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:08.951 region:rollup2
meetings are about

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:10.953 region:rollup2
implementation.

01:13:08.951 --> 01:13:12.989 region:rollup2
Of things and so.

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:15.057 region:rollup2
I know that was a long thing but

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:15.625 region:rollup2
have you any of you ever thought

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:18.961 region:rollup2
at least on the healthcare.

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:19.528 region:rollup2
What we could do?

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:29.005 region:rollup2
The people better mentally

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:31.140 region:rollup2
prepared beyond.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:31.707 region:rollup2
Okay thank you a so where you

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.109 region:rollup2
where you're talking about.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:35.278 region:rollup2
.

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:37.246 region:rollup2
Really briefly as we have a

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:39.181 region:rollup2
national group through though

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.782 region:rollup2
one is called the wisdom keepers

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.083 region:rollup2
of the national court by those

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:43.252 region:rollup2
that work.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:45.087 region:rollup2
The wasn't keepers is a group of

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.588 region:rollup2
African American males.

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.089 region:rollup2
Native American males.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:49.091 region:rollup2
.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:51.560 region:rollup2
Chicago males.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:53.262 region:rollup2
From all over the country we've

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.197 region:rollup2
been meeting for about three

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:57.199 region:rollup2
years now and we that.

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.867 region:rollup2
The before the national

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.502 region:rollup2
composite works been around for

01:13:57.867 --> 01:14:00.069 region:rollup2
over twenty years and we have

01:13:59.502 --> 01:14:01.237 region:rollup2
implemented these rites of

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:03.239 region:rollup2
passages.

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:03.806 region:rollup2
.

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:05.241 region:rollup2
Throughout the country right

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:07.710 region:rollup2
and.

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:09.645 region:rollup2
Now we are working with African

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:11.480 region:rollup2
American males and even some of

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:13.215 region:rollup2
our own tribes to bring back

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.849 region:rollup2
these rites of passage is a

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:15.184 region:rollup2
healthy rights of passage ways.

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:17.420 region:rollup2
Which

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:18.020 region:rollup2
help the deal with all the

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.157 region:rollup2
issues that we've been talking

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:23.192 region:rollup2
about so. There is a model we we

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.559 region:rollup2
actually did a presentation to

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:25.227 region:rollup2
president Obama.

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:27.229 region:rollup2
.

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:29.198 region:rollup2
We did a presentation to have.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:29.865 region:rollup2
So there is something already

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:31.267 region:rollup2
out there that we can use as a

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:33.569 region:rollup2
model.

01:14:31.267 --> 01:14:35.538 region:rollup2
Adele all in with this for such

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:37.440 region:rollup2
a long time back check I get

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:39.308 region:rollup2
really excited like or maggots

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:41.210 region:rollup2
actually sit with some men that

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:43.312 region:rollup2
are doing amazing work because.

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:45.514 region:rollup2
A lot of times you.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:47.316 region:rollup2
I feel so lonely working with

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:49.251 region:rollup2
young man because.

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.852 region:rollup2
The the resources are so I don't

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:53.289 region:rollup2
see any other so minimal and.

01:14:49.852 --> 01:14:55.257 region:rollup2
A lot of times it's you.

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.925 region:rollup2
It's just you by yourself and.

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.693 region:rollup2
You know your out there trying

01:14:55.925 --> 01:15:00.563 region:rollup2
to also trying to get a little

01:14:57.693 --> 01:15:01.163 region:rollup2
money for this three taking the

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:02.465 region:rollup2
kids to eat your wife's that

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.065 region:rollup2
white you white you pay for the

01:15:02.465 --> 01:15:03.299 region:rollup2
food and you know I mean it's

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:07.236 region:rollup2
like.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:07.837 region:rollup2
.

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.238 region:rollup2
Twenty six years she's put up

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:11.273 region:rollup2
with it you know but arm.

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.907 region:rollup2
So so it's just something to

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:13.709 region:rollup2
think about their is models out

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:15.578 region:rollup2
there we do have models that and

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:17.513 region:rollup2
we're working with you know with

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:19.415 region:rollup2
men of color who are some really

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:21.250 region:rollup2
powerful elders in their work

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:21.817 region:rollup2
throughout the country so. So if

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:27.823 region:rollup2
they're now it's a matter of

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:30.259 region:rollup2
building that.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:31.827 region:rollup2
If it the thing that I would add

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:33.796 region:rollup2
on that I completely agree as a

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:35.931 region:rollup2
lot of good models which you

01:15:33.796 --> 01:15:36.632 region:rollup2
know rites of passage models.

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:37.967 region:rollup2
Bob a lot of folks lot of folks

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:38.567 region:rollup2
in this room were doing.

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:39.969 region:rollup2
A lot of hard work to make it

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:41.871 region:rollup2
happen.

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:42.471 region:rollup2
I dearly weekend.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.939 region:rollup2
So to get to them before they

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:46.609 region:rollup2
experienced

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:49.145 region:rollup2
alright so we can do a better

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:49.712 region:rollup2
job of holding. Educators

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:51.180 region:rollup2
accountable holding systems

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.814 region:rollup2
accountable.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.348 region:rollup2
Because you know you. In many

01:15:51.814 --> 01:15:53.182 region:rollup2
ways I think a lot of the

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:55.351 region:rollup2
trauma.

01:15:53.182 --> 01:15:55.684 region:rollup2
Is is.

01:15:55.351 --> 01:15:58.554 region:rollup2
Preventable.

01:15:55.684 --> 01:16:00.523 region:rollup2
But we don't have good good

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:02.158 region:rollup2
systems are good ways to hold

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:04.226 region:rollup2
folks accountable.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.727 region:rollup2
Serving young man in ways that

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.061 region:rollup2
would prevent them from

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:05.661 region:rollup2
experiencing a

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:06.061 region:rollup2
when the young man should have

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:10.032 region:rollup2
to.

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:10.266 region:rollup2
You'll be traumatized going to

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.001 region:rollup2
school.

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:12.601 region:rollup2
Think about that.

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:14.403 region:rollup2
But you know so many of our

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:17.006 region:rollup2
schools now do a better job of

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:17.673 region:rollup2
preparing young men.

01:16:17.006 --> 01:16:21.110 region:rollup2
The a better job preventive for

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:21.710 region:rollup2
presenting a do for for life.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:25.267 region:rollup2
Given the work force and so

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:25.267 region:rollup2
forth so I think it's.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:27.433 region:rollup2
Got a sort of address it on on

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:28.484 region:rollup2
But all possible

01:16:27.883 --> 01:16:29.552 region:rollup2
three to support the programs

01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:31.587 region:rollup2
and

01:16:29.552 --> 01:16:32.188 region:rollup2
you know I Daly knowledge them.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:35.591 region:rollup2
But also not at the expense of

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:35.891 region:rollup2
holding.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.661 region:rollup2
Actors and.

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:39.228 region:rollup2
Educators and

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:42.331 region:rollup2
police officers in the city

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:42.865 region:rollup2
accountable for for serving them

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:46.035 region:rollup2
the what if they should.

Thank you have.

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:52.041 region:rollup2
Thank you could not have our

Thank you.

01:16:54.043 --> 01:17:00.049 region:rollup2

And Diana Ross.

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:28.077 region:rollup2
Civilian and Diana Ross.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:34.083 region:rollup2
Mitt CD can.

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:34.717 region:rollup2
Definitely go for.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:38.053 region:rollup2
Well I what I feel is an honor

01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:40.022 region:rollup2
to be here today to speak to.

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:40.656 region:rollup2
Assembly members and the

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.957 region:rollup2
audience about the need to boys

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:44.093 region:rollup2
and men of color.

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:44.760 region:rollup2
Because.

01:17:44.093 --> 01:17:46.495 region:rollup2
As it makes a mental health we

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.264 region:rollup2
know that one of every five

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.531 region:rollup2
adults someone every six

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.999 region:rollup2
children.

01:17:48.531 --> 01:17:54.136 region:rollup2
Have a mental illness

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:56.105 region:rollup2
suffer from emotional trauma.

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.772 region:rollup2
The user cho that number is even

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:58.641 region:rollup2
higher. Because they experience

01:17:56.772 --> 01:18:00.142 region:rollup2
in their exposure to trauma in

01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:02.144 region:rollup2
their homes in the schools.

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:06.248 region:rollup2
And in that community.

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:06.749 region:rollup2
Just propel them. To live a life

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:10.119 region:rollup2
with. Many mental health

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:12.087 region:rollup2
challenge.

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:12.755 region:rollup2
I've worked in prisons

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:16.225 region:rollup2
I've worked in communities I've

01:18:12.755 --> 01:18:16.759 region:rollup2
worked with.

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:19.628 region:rollup2
Many individuals and very

01:18:16.759 --> 01:18:21.330 region:rollup2
settings I'm and I recognize

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.964 region:rollup2
that.

01:18:21.330 --> 01:18:23.365 region:rollup2
Many of boys and men the colors

01:18:21.964 --> 01:18:28.270 region:rollup2
received mental health services.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:28.904 region:rollup2
Either through prison.

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:31.373 region:rollup2
Also institutional mental health

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:33.342 region:rollup2
institutional setting.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.976 region:rollup2
Very little would. Of these

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:34.109 region:rollup2
individuals received a spectrum

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:35.377 region:rollup2
of

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:37.813 region:rollup2
prevention.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:39.381 region:rollup2
Early intervention. Out patient

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:41.383 region:rollup2
care.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:44.954 region:rollup2
And very little innovative.

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:45.621 region:rollup2
So.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:46.121 region:rollup2
We really need the San Diego to

01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:49.058 region:rollup2
really change how we do

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:49.725 region:rollup2
business.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.226 region:rollup2
Related to these individuals and

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:53.062 region:rollup2
million provide quality

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:53.729 region:rollup2
services.

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.064 region:rollup2
But I am pleased to say the same

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:57.333 region:rollup2
vehicles on the path.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:59.101 region:rollup2
As we are trying some innovative

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:04.273 region:rollup2
approaches.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:04.907 region:rollup2
I kicked few key programs I I

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:07.409 region:rollup2
actually one myself and you see

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:07.810 region:rollup2
the gentleman with the. Father

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.478 region:rollup2
child shirts out.

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:09.979 region:rollup2
Those individuals who have many

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.313 region:rollup2
have come from its and

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:13.616 region:rollup2
incarceration.

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:15.351 region:rollup2
They got onto a fatherhood

01:19:13.616 --> 01:19:17.386 region:rollup2
program which is really

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:19.488 region:rollup2
relational and mentoring.

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:21.390 region:rollup2
Up and has changed many I would

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:23.692 region:rollup2
and talking to them you see.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.326 region:rollup2
How the program even though they

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:25.394 region:rollup2
at first didn't think was going

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:27.596 region:rollup2
to be anything?

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:29.398 region:rollup2
Made a tremendous difference in

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:32.468 region:rollup2
the lives.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:35.504 region:rollup2
We also have a. Bit providing

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:36.038 region:rollup2
alternatives to kill pro and men

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:36.305 region:rollup2
alternatives to detention

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:37.306 region:rollup2
program.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:39.708 region:rollup2
We work with kids

01:19:37.306 --> 01:19:40.009 region:rollup2
who maybe early hitting the law

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.377 region:rollup2
enforcement

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:43.846 region:rollup2
really divert them.

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:47.383 region:rollup2
From long term involvement with

01:19:43.846 --> 01:19:48.017 region:rollup2
the command just so.

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:49.351 region:rollup2
And I also have now surfaced

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:53.322 region:rollup2
that are going to homes.

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:55.357 region:rollup2
Working with the myth probation

01:19:53.322 --> 01:19:56.025 region:rollup2
news and families in their home.

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.760 region:rollup2
So that we can address not only

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:59.361 region:rollup2
the issues that the children

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:01.530 region:rollup2
might be for.

01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:03.565 region:rollup2
But all that family member the

01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:05.734 region:rollup2
siblings and really help them

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:07.403 region:rollup2
develop of that equality mental

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:09.405 region:rollup2
health and.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:11.840 region:rollup2
But really that's not enough.

01:20:09.405 --> 01:20:13.409 region:rollup2
We know that we are only up to

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:15.611 region:rollup2
the tip of the iceberg.

01:20:13.409 --> 01:20:17.479 region:rollup2
We he oftentimes people talk

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:19.715 region:rollup2
about having create his

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:21.417 region:rollup2
conversations with links to race

01:20:19.715 --> 01:20:22.017 region:rollup2
or individual succumb.

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:23.385 region:rollup2
But I'm here to say we need to

01:20:22.017 --> 01:20:25.387 region:rollup2
have courageous.

01:20:23.385 --> 01:20:27.389 region:rollup2
Action.

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:29.458 region:rollup2
Not just compensation.

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:31.393 region:rollup2
Because oftentimes those

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.894 region:rollup2
conversations.

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.295 region:rollup2
Really just how like the

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:37.333 region:rollup2
problem.

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:37.933 region:rollup2
But they don't begin to address.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.435 region:rollup2
So what does that mean as it

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:41.437 region:rollup2
relates to.

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:45.341 region:rollup2
I'm are funding or.

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:46.008 region:rollup2
Our issue Arab policy.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:49.445 region:rollup2
We have to make them culturally

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:50.079 region:rollup2
relevant.

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:50.546 region:rollup2
I oftentimes so the cringe of

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:53.449 region:rollup2
people think cultural

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:55.317 region:rollup2
competence.

01:20:53.449 --> 01:20:57.386 region:rollup2
Well that's for you internally.

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:57.986 region:rollup2
But culturally cultural

01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:01.390 region:rollup2
relevance means you have to.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:21:02.024 region:rollup2
Still only be able to relate to

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.425 region:rollup2
the people that are in front of

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:05.394 region:rollup2
you.

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:06.061 region:rollup2
And unfortunately

01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:07.329 region:rollup2
many of our programs a services

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:09.732 region:rollup2
just don't do that.

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:11.467 region:rollup2
Weeks week retired people as.

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:15.471 region:rollup2
.

01:21:11.467 --> 01:21:16.138 region:rollup2
I'm it unresponsive.

01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:17.740 region:rollup2
Well it really is that we didn't

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.107 region:rollup2
respond we didn't deliver

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.975 region:rollup2
appropriately.

01:21:18.107 --> 01:21:21.844 region:rollup2
So we have to really make sure

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:23.679 region:rollup2
that the services that are

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:25.381 region:rollup2
dedicated services from boys and

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.914 region:rollup2
men of color.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.483 region:rollup2
Not program the father the

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:28.117 region:rollup2
child.

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:31.453 region:rollup2
These men are trained by other

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:33.422 region:rollup2
men.

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:35.591 region:rollup2
We also help them to see. What

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:37.593 region:rollup2
can they do with individuals of

01:21:35.591 --> 01:21:39.361 region:rollup2
their own race how they relate

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:39.995 region:rollup2
to each other?

01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:41.463 region:rollup2
So we've had fathers minute who

01:21:39.995 --> 01:21:45.501 region:rollup2
were older men.

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:47.403 region:rollup2
Training young amend.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:49.538 region:rollup2
Each will have a gun a Carson.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:51.407 region:rollup2
Help in the private jobs many of

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:52.107 region:rollup2
them helping them just a.

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:53.542 region:rollup2
Understand how they can lake to

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:55.878 region:rollup2
their wives or girlfriends.

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:57.546 region:rollup2
And you know something we did

01:21:55.878 --> 01:21:58.113 region:rollup2
about little but the money.

01:21:57.546 --> 01:21:59.548 region:rollup2
But we've served over seven

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.048 region:rollup2
hundred minutes.

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:01.517 region:rollup2
So it really has made a

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:03.752 region:rollup2
difference

01:22:01.517 --> 01:22:05.854 region:rollup2
number one program but this

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:07.489 region:rollup2
should there are many programs.

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:09.625 region:rollup2
Or we should be expanding these

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:11.427 region:rollup2
kinds of programs in the

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:13.495 region:rollup2
relational way it works.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:15.531 region:rollup2
So I would encourage us to

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:17.466 region:rollup2
really all of us have to be a

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:18.066 region:rollup2
part of the solution.

01:22:17.466 --> 01:22:19.468 region:rollup2
And we have to do it in a way

01:22:18.066 --> 01:22:21.770 region:rollup2
that's really meaningful.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:23.472 region:rollup2
And really men of color have

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.841 region:rollup2
often been forgotten.

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:27.476 region:rollup2
Ugh ugh services mental health

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:28.143 region:rollup2
services.

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.711 region:rollup2
I'm not really here to really

01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:30.012 region:rollup2
helping them within the

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:39.454 region:rollup2
positively.

01:22:30.012 --> 01:22:41.457 region:rollup2
We have to change.

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:43.826 region:rollup2
Good afternoon everyone.

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:44.493 region:rollup2
My name is Dana Richardson work

01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:45.527 region:rollup2
for community health improvement

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:47.763 region:rollup2
partnership

01:22:45.527 --> 01:22:49.598 region:rollup2
organization where Sir it

01:22:47.763 --> 01:22:50.098 region:rollup2
manslaughter term solutions to

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:52.034 region:rollup2
priority health needs.

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:53.569 region:rollup2
The collaboration advocacy and

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:55.971 region:rollup2
community engagement

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:57.739 region:rollup2
slotted be here with you and to

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:59.608 region:rollup2
share some thoughts under the

01:22:57.739 --> 01:23:01.677 region:rollup2
health category.

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:03.612 region:rollup2
A specifically I'm here to share

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:05.647 region:rollup2
with you about a program that I

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:06.181 region:rollup2
co founded a co created. Back in

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.616 region:rollup2
twenty eleven called the

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:09.618 region:rollup2
resident leadership academy.

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:10.285 region:rollup2
This program was created in

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.987 region:rollup2
partnership with the county San

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:12.221 region:rollup2
Diego health and Human Services

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.889 region:rollup2
agency.

01:23:12.221 --> 01:23:15.657 region:rollup2
Through the communities putting

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:17.659 region:rollup2
prevention work initiative which

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:19.695 region:rollup2
existed here in San Diego from

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:20.128 region:rollup2
late twenty ten to March twenty

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:21.964 region:rollup2
twelve. And this.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:25.634 region:rollup2
Fast track initiative focus

01:23:21.964 --> 01:23:26.235 region:rollup2
largely on obesity prevention.

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.970 region:rollup2
A couple of things I like for

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:29.771 region:rollup2
you to look out for in the

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:31.607 region:rollup2
moments I have to share our

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:32.207 region:rollup2
number one not describe for you

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.809 region:rollup2
what the resident leadership

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.878 region:rollup2
academy program is. How it has

01:23:33.809 --> 01:23:37.679 region:rollup2
evolved and grown over the last

01:23:35.878 --> 01:23:39.815 region:rollup2
six seven years number to

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:41.617 region:rollup2
describe for you how the are

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:42.217 region:rollup2
lazy and forums and empowers

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:43.685 region:rollup2
local leaders to make change?

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:45.954 region:rollup2
And number three a profile local

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:47.623 region:rollup2
level examples of community

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.290 region:rollup2
driven.

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:49.625 region:rollup2
Change influenced by the or lay

01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:50.192 region:rollup2
and related outcomes.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:51.894 region:rollup2
So the resident leadership

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:53.795 region:rollup2
academy as a ten session

01:23:51.894 --> 01:23:55.731 region:rollup2
curriculum based public of

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:56.298 region:rollup2
leadership program that teaches

01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:57.866 region:rollup2
residents were underserved

01:23:56.298 --> 01:24:00.002 region:rollup2
underrepresented areas how to

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:01.670 region:rollup2
become health advocate for a

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:02.271 region:rollup2
lifetime.

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:03.639 region:rollup2
Especially as it relates to

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:05.707 region:rollup2
address an issue the public

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:06.275 region:rollup2
safety healthy food access an

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.910 region:rollup2
increase in the quality of

01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:09.711 region:rollup2
physical activity opportunities

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:11.813 region:rollup2
underserved neighborhoods.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:13.849 region:rollup2
As far as the curriculum itself

01:24:11.813 --> 01:24:14.516 region:rollup2
their curriculum. Based training

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:15.984 region:rollup2
was intentionally designed as an

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:18.020 region:rollup2
educational journey that will

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:19.721 region:rollup2
ultimately lead to facilitating

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.757 region:rollup2
the self determination and

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:23.692 region:rollup2
mobilization of residents were

01:24:21.757 --> 01:24:24.259 region:rollup2
under represented neighborhoods.

01:24:23.692 --> 01:24:25.894 region:rollup2
Across San Diego to address

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:27.696 region:rollup2
their own public health issues

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:29.765 region:rollup2
and concerns.

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:30.465 region:rollup2
The curriculum begins with

01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:32.100 region:rollup2
orientation to the environment.

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:33.835 region:rollup2
An overview of community

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.771 region:rollup2
building principles in the

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:36.371 region:rollup2
social determinants of health in

01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:36.905 region:rollup2
this nucleus of learning we're

01:24:36.371 --> 01:24:37.940 region:rollup2
building a foundation for

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:39.841 region:rollup2
action.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.843 region:rollup2
In the participants general

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:42.377 region:rollup2
understanding that it is the

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:44.112 region:rollup2
environmental social and

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:46.014 region:rollup2
economic conditions that exist

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:47.783 region:rollup2
in our society which are largely

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:49.885 region:rollup2
culpable for the disparities and

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:51.720 region:rollup2
exit and inequities that exists

01:24:49.885 --> 01:24:52.321 region:rollup2
in our community.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.956 region:rollup2
We believe that environments

01:24:52.321 --> 01:24:55.691 region:rollup2
matter and that we're

01:24:53.956 --> 01:24:56.258 region:rollup2
essentially products of our

01:24:55.691 --> 01:24:57.726 region:rollup2
environment and the health

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:59.761 region:rollup2
happens and neighborhoods.

01:24:57.726 --> 01:25:01.697 region:rollup2
But building a foundation for

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:02.297 region:rollup2
action we move on to profiling

01:25:01.697 --> 01:25:04.066 region:rollup2
for participants a number of

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:05.867 region:rollup2
evidence based public health

01:25:04.066 --> 01:25:07.803 region:rollup2
focus strategies for the

01:25:05.867 --> 01:25:08.437 region:rollup2
neighborhoods consideration of

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:10.238 region:rollup2
which strategies work best for

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:12.074 region:rollup2
them. And the development of the

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:14.009 region:rollup2
action plan for improving their

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:15.744 region:rollup2
communities health. The sessions

01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:16.345 region:rollup2
include safe walkable

01:25:15.744 --> 01:25:17.879 region:rollup2
communities crime prevention

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:19.915 region:rollup2
through environmental design

01:25:17.879 --> 01:25:21.750 region:rollup2
healthy food systems land is

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:22.351 region:rollup2
community planning and

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.453 region:rollup2
leadership advocacy and policy

01:25:22.351 --> 01:25:27.122 region:rollup2
development.

01:25:24.453 --> 01:25:27.689 region:rollup2
And after teaching participants

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.124 region:rollup2
about these evidence based

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:31.126 region:rollup2
public of focused focused

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:33.128 region:rollup2
strategies we transition from

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:35.297 region:rollup2
facilitating not education

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:37.165 region:rollup2
sessions work sessions. With the

01:25:35.297 --> 01:25:37.833 region:rollup2
participants were they identify

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:39.401 region:rollup2
group roles and responsibilities

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:41.436 region:rollup2
collect and analyze data develop

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:43.472 region:rollup2
action plans with a vision

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:45.407 region:rollup2
mission goals objectives an

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:47.309 region:rollup2
outcome measures and ultimately

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:47.876 region:rollup2
plan for conducting. A smart

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.544 region:rollup2
celebration which releases

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:51.246 region:rollup2
formal action plans in the

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:53.215 region:rollup2
community.

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.849 region:rollup2
Let us is a high level summary

01:25:53.215 --> 01:25:55.183 region:rollup2
of a process which usually takes

01:25:53.849 --> 01:25:57.719 region:rollup2
about ten fourteen weeks

01:25:55.183 --> 01:26:00.622 region:rollup2
but please know that with our

01:25:57.719 --> 01:26:01.256 region:rollup2
late we seize every opportunity.

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.791 region:rollup2
To harness an ingrained in the

01:26:01.256 --> 01:26:04.459 region:rollup2
minds of participants to help

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:04.993 region:rollup2
happens in neighborhoods and

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:06.628 region:rollup2
that environments matter.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:08.864 region:rollup2
And we capacity residents for

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:10.532 region:rollup2
action by imparting a very clear

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:12.567 region:rollup2
and simple framework. For

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:13.168 region:rollup2
improving health at the

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:14.803 region:rollup2
grassroots level focusing on

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.905 region:rollup2
public safety healthy food

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:18.473 region:rollup2
access and increasing physical

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.974 region:rollup2
activity opportunities.

01:26:18.473 --> 01:26:20.809 region:rollup2
We believe the by first

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:22.577 region:rollup2
beginning with the fundamental

01:26:20.809 --> 01:26:23.111 region:rollup2
and basic understanding of how

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:24.713 region:rollup2
to improve health at the

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:26.681 region:rollup2
grassroots level that the

01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:28.583 region:rollup2
community naturally becomes more

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:30.519 region:rollup2
fundamentally prepared oppose.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:32.487 region:rollup2
To address issues which fall

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:33.188 region:rollup2
outside of the scope of

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:34.756 region:rollup2
traditional health care services

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:36.758 region:rollup2
and western medicine here I'm

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:38.460 region:rollup2
talking about the importance of

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.927 region:rollup2
capacity adding residents.

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.462 region:rollup2
To address the social

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:42.431 region:rollup2
determinants of health.

01:26:40.462 --> 01:26:44.566 region:rollup2
Which other conditions under

01:26:42.431 --> 01:26:46.501 region:rollup2
which people are born live work

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:47.102 region:rollup2
pray play an age.

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:48.737 region:rollup2
Now that you have that as a

01:26:47.102 --> 01:26:50.505 region:rollup2
background was talk about

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:52.474 region:rollup2
outcomes.

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:53.141 region:rollup2
And in just the last six years

01:26:52.474 --> 01:26:54.776 region:rollup2
after the program's creation in

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:56.611 region:rollup2
twenty eleven I could tell you

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:58.580 region:rollup2
that this programs member

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:59.181 region:rollup2
replicated successfully. Over

01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.782 region:rollup2
fifty times in this county

01:26:59.181 --> 01:27:01.316 region:rollup2
reaching over a thousand

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.451 region:rollup2
residents and neighborhood

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:04.453 region:rollup2
communities

01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:06.621 region:rollup2
throughout San Diego essentially

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:08.457 region:rollup2
launching. Dozens of community

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.990 region:rollup2
improvement campaigns led by

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:10.759 region:rollup2
residents themselves and

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:12.761 region:rollup2
somebody's examples include

01:27:10.759 --> 01:27:14.463 region:rollup2
reclaiming parts from the threat

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:16.565 region:rollup2
of gangs violence and other

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:17.132 region:rollup2
illicit activities through park

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:18.767 region:rollup2
surveillance and reporting.

01:27:17.132 --> 01:27:20.769 region:rollup2
Limiting alcohol outlook

01:27:18.767 --> 01:27:20.936 region:rollup2
concentration and presents a

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:22.871 region:rollup2
disk

01:27:20.936 --> 01:27:24.539 region:rollup2
Spencer reason marginalized

01:27:22.871 --> 01:27:25.073 region:rollup2
neighborhoods.

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.908 region:rollup2
Building community through

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:28.844 region:rollup2
creating a maintaining community

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:30.545 region:rollup2
gardens and sections of the

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:32.681 region:rollup2
community which were formally

01:27:30.545 --> 01:27:34.649 region:rollup2
blighted. Advocating for joy use

01:27:32.681 --> 01:27:35.283 region:rollup2
agreements with schools and park

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:36.918 region:rollup2
poor neighborhoods to encourage

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:38.553 region:rollup2
physical activity opportunities

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:40.522 region:rollup2
just to name a few.

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:42.724 region:rollup2
Essentially these grassroots

01:27:40.522 --> 01:27:44.659 region:rollup2
mobilization efforts represents

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:45.260 region:rollup2
a long term sustainable public

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:46.895 region:rollup2
of leadership and underserved

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.797 region:rollup2
communities which is ultimately

01:27:46.895 --> 01:27:49.498 region:rollup2
what we need to improve the

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:52.567 region:rollup2
overall health status. And Hynde

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:53.201 region:rollup2
neighborhoods

01:27:52.567 --> 01:27:54.870 region:rollup2
so consequently of San Diego.

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:56.838 region:rollup2
Announced widely known and

01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:58.774 region:rollup2
understood that with every

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.307 region:rollup2
additional resident leadership

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.976 region:rollup2
academy graduate and the

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.611 region:rollup2
community that the health of San

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:04.579 region:rollup2
Diego and proves.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:05.213 region:rollup2
And it doesn't just stop there

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.948 region:rollup2
in summer twenty thirteen my

01:28:05.213 --> 01:28:08.650 region:rollup2
colleague and I created a train

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:09.284 region:rollup2
the trainer program which

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:11.086 region:rollup2
consists of four non consecutive

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.954 region:rollup2
days eight hours each day thirty

01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:14.923 region:rollup2
two hours total. And four short

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:16.958 region:rollup2
years we've certified five

01:28:14.923 --> 01:28:18.727 region:rollup2
cohorts totaling seventy three

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:20.662 region:rollup2
certified trainers that can

01:28:18.727 --> 01:28:21.163 region:rollup2
effectively disseminate this

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.831 region:rollup2
model in the community.

01:28:21.163 --> 01:28:24.733 region:rollup2
So consequently over the years

01:28:22.831 --> 01:28:27.002 region:rollup2
the resident leadership academy

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:29.004 region:rollup2
family as grow exponentially in

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:30.705 region:rollup2
size to become an impressive

01:28:29.004 --> 01:28:32.707 region:rollup2
critical mass of advocates some

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:34.609 region:rollup2
of us are council members some

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:35.210 region:rollup2
of us a mayor's faith leaders

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:35.443 region:rollup2
members of community planning

01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:37.078 region:rollup2
groups.

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:38.847 region:rollup2
Middle managers and directors of

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:40.615 region:rollup2
local nonprofits assembly

01:28:38.847 --> 01:28:42.584 region:rollup2
locally focused grassroots

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:43.151 region:rollup2
leaders were diplomatic

01:28:42.584 --> 01:28:44.920 region:rollup2
consistent and committed to

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:46.621 region:rollup2
ensuring that the community

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.222 region:rollup2
prospective is hurt. By the.

01:28:46.621 --> 01:28:48.590 region:rollup2
Local institutions and policy

01:28:47.222 --> 01:28:50.792 region:rollup2
makers

01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:52.761 region:rollup2
to make sure that all people

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:54.629 region:rollup2
have an opportunity for good

01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:56.665 region:rollup2
health and good quality of life.

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:57.332 region:rollup2
I'll go ahead and stop there but

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:59.067 region:rollup2
what I can tell you is that.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:29:01.069 region:rollup2
There are lays a mainstay in San

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:02.737 region:rollup2
Diego and that the good news is

01:29:01.069 --> 01:29:04.806 region:rollup2
that this particular model

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:05.440 region:rollup2
Justin twenty eighteen will go

01:29:04.806 --> 01:29:06.675 region:rollup2
national through contract with

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:08.910 region:rollup2
neighbor works American.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:10.745 region:rollup2
Is process of Mississippi

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:12.714 region:rollup2
facilitated successfully cross

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:13.315 region:rollup2
culturally with youth groups and

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.983 region:rollup2
with intergenerational groups

01:29:13.315 --> 01:29:16.651 region:rollup2
and this created the healing

01:29:14.983 --> 01:29:20.589 region:rollup2
that we need in our.

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:26.695 region:rollup2
Thank you for your touch.

01:29:20.589 --> 01:29:28.864 region:rollup2
Ross.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:29.431 region:rollup2
Hi I'm Diana Roth and I'm the

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:30.732 region:rollup2
executive director admits he

01:29:29.431 --> 01:29:34.803 region:rollup2
can.

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:36.872 region:rollup2
But I am also a fester and.

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:40.609 region:rollup2
Amman and

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:41.209 region:rollup2
I this issue is particularly

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:42.744 region:rollup2
important to me. Of for those

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:45.046 region:rollup2
reasons.

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:46.748 region:rollup2
It's taken me a long time to

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:48.984 region:rollup2
talk about that.

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:51.086 region:rollup2
Because it had a significant

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:52.721 region:rollup2
impact on my childhood and who I

01:29:51.086 --> 01:29:54.723 region:rollup2
am today in.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:56.725 region:rollup2
And that's the reality of of the

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:58.894 region:rollup2
trauma that my brother

01:29:56.725 --> 01:30:01.062 region:rollup2
experienced and that. My family

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:01.296 region:rollup2
experience interfacing with the

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.731 region:rollup2
justice

01:30:01.296 --> 01:30:04.666 region:rollup2
them.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:07.035 region:rollup2
I here in San Diego.

01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:08.837 region:rollup2
We grew up here immigrant family

01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:11.039 region:rollup2
speaking Spanish. My brother

01:30:08.837 --> 01:30:12.807 region:rollup2
into the system. Of pretty young

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:13.341 region:rollup2
me start interacting maybe age

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.776 region:rollup2
twelve I I don't remember

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:17.112 region:rollup2
exactly who was.

01:30:14.776 --> 01:30:18.780 region:rollup2
In over twenty years ago I'm

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:20.849 region:rollup2
kinda old now.

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.884 region:rollup2
But to fast forward today what

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:24.619 region:rollup2
is he up to I I can't see that

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.986 region:rollup2
he's in college accounts that

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:27.022 region:rollup2
he's employed.

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:29.057 region:rollup2
But this is what I can say

01:30:27.022 --> 01:30:31.026 region:rollup2
about him is that he splits his

01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:31.326 region:rollup2
time in and out of detention

01:30:31.026 --> 01:30:32.761 region:rollup2
facilities.

01:30:31.326 --> 01:30:34.663 region:rollup2
And.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:36.798 region:rollup2
Living on the streets.

01:30:34.663 --> 01:30:38.700 region:rollup2
And in and out of.

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:41.102 region:rollup2
The psychiatric laca.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:42.704 region:rollup2
And now my mom and her three

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:45.073 region:rollup2
year old boy.

01:30:42.704 --> 01:30:47.042 region:rollup2
And I was still speak Spanish at

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:50.812 region:rollup2
home. And it's hard for me to

01:30:47.042 --> 01:30:52.847 region:rollup2
look at him. And think of what

01:30:50.812 --> 01:30:54.716 region:rollup2
happened to my brother and

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:56.751 region:rollup2
wonder if.

01:30:54.716 --> 01:30:58.753 region:rollup2
This could happen to him even

01:30:56.751 --> 01:31:00.689 region:rollup2
though I would try my hardest

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:02.657 region:rollup2
just like my mom dad.

01:31:00.689 --> 01:31:04.826 region:rollup2
To keep him out of the system

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:06.695 region:rollup2
and and on path to to being a.

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:07.262 region:rollup2
Strong and all.

01:31:06.695 --> 01:31:08.897 region:rollup2
So we've we've done a lot I

01:31:07.262 --> 01:31:11.099 region:rollup2
think just the fact that this

01:31:08.897 --> 01:31:12.834 region:rollup2
exists in that we're talking

01:31:11.099 --> 01:31:14.803 region:rollup2
about this today. And that

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:16.738 region:rollup2
arrest rates are going down and

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:17.305 region:rollup2
that we're having these

01:31:16.738 --> 01:31:19.007 region:rollup2
courageous conversations of

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:22.811 region:rollup2
after fee would say.

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:24.846 region:rollup2
But it's not enough because the

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:27.048 region:rollup2
trend still show that my son.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:30.819 region:rollup2
Whose of a bi racial child. Is

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:31.386 region:rollup2
probably more likely to be on

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:33.088 region:rollup2
track to the path that my

01:31:31.386 --> 01:31:35.056 region:rollup2
brother was in the eighties and

01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:36.758 region:rollup2
nineties than on a path to

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:39.160 region:rollup2
career.

01:31:36.758 --> 01:31:40.995 region:rollup2
If I could say one thing the

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.064 region:rollup2
power of our great state

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:45.066 region:rollup2
government is that you have the

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:46.801 region:rollup2
power to enact massive systemic

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:48.770 region:rollup2
changes.

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:50.805 region:rollup2
And to hold people accountable

01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:51.373 region:rollup2
for implementing them.

01:31:50.805 --> 01:31:54.776 region:rollup2
I would urge you to create

01:31:51.373 --> 01:31:56.845 region:rollup2
policies that institutionalize

01:31:54.776 --> 01:31:58.947 region:rollup2
restorative alternatives. In the

01:31:56.845 --> 01:32:00.949 region:rollup2
juvenile justice system as well

01:31:58.947 --> 01:32:01.549 region:rollup2
as our schools because we know

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:03.885 region:rollup2
that something is not working

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:06.087 region:rollup2
there.

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:07.956 region:rollup2
I would also urge you to insure

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:09.991 region:rollup2
that the money that doesn't

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:12.093 region:rollup2
needed for youth development.

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:14.162 region:rollup2
Resulting from prop sixty four.

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:16.331 region:rollup2
Goes truly into youth

01:32:14.162 --> 01:32:18.333 region:rollup2
development because if you were

01:32:16.331 --> 01:32:20.135 region:rollup2
to ask and and doctor Weber I

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:20.835 region:rollup2
know you know that if. If you

01:32:20.135 --> 01:32:22.370 region:rollup2
were to take a look at how many

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:24.439 region:rollup2
like that might be used in San

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:26.041 region:rollup2
Diego. It's more likely to be

01:32:24.439 --> 01:32:28.043 region:rollup2
designated to law enforcement.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.610 region:rollup2
And.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:32.047 region:rollup2
What we really know what's

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:32.714 region:rollup2
happening is you suppression?

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:34.349 region:rollup2
Also if you're great powers of

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:36.351 region:rollup2
influence I would ask you to

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:38.319 region:rollup2
urge local entities with their

01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:40.188 region:rollup2
own taxation measures resulting

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.755 region:rollup2
from prop sixty four. To create

01:32:40.188 --> 01:32:42.023 region:rollup2
their own youth development

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:44.292 region:rollup2
funds.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:46.261 region:rollup2
And make sure that those

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:48.430 region:rollup2
resources and that money is goes

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:50.432 region:rollup2
into early childhood education

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:52.333 region:rollup2
because of some of my colleagues

01:32:50.432 --> 01:32:52.967 region:rollup2
mentioned. We know that around

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:56.070 region:rollup2
third or fourth grade something

01:32:52.967 --> 01:32:56.671 region:rollup2
happens.

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:58.440 region:rollup2
The education synergy project

01:32:56.671 --> 01:33:00.208 region:rollup2
has done their research and if

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.842 region:rollup2
you look at where San Diego

01:33:00.208 --> 01:33:02.077 region:rollup2
invest their greatest amount of

01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:02.644 region:rollup2
money.

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:04.079 region:rollup2
It's not an early childhood

01:33:02.644 --> 01:33:06.548 region:rollup2
education.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:10.218 region:rollup2
Health cannot be and linked from

01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:12.487 region:rollup2
this pattern. We know that kids

01:33:10.218 --> 01:33:14.055 region:rollup2
who end up in jail or miss a lot

01:33:12.487 --> 01:33:16.257 region:rollup2
of school.

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:18.359 region:rollup2
Have an increased rate of drug

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:22.197 region:rollup2
use HIV tuberculosis other

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:24.099 region:rollup2
diseases injuries violence PTSD.

01:33:22.197 --> 01:33:26.134 region:rollup2
Trauma.

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:28.570 region:rollup2
And I could go on and on.

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:30.371 region:rollup2
Those two things are linked and

01:33:28.570 --> 01:33:32.140 region:rollup2
there's a myriad of studies that

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:34.476 region:rollup2
say so.

01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:36.144 region:rollup2
In Santiago alone while the rest

01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:38.379 region:rollup2
is down.

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:40.248 region:rollup2
African Americans and people of

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:42.150 region:rollup2
East African descent African

01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:44.119 region:rollup2
descent of in Sandiego.

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:48.223 region:rollup2
Continue to lag behind.

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:50.258 region:rollup2
Twenty three point seven out of

01:33:48.223 --> 01:33:52.193 region:rollup2
a thousand people use continue

01:33:50.258 --> 01:33:54.329 region:rollup2
to be arrested by. And

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:56.097 region:rollup2
communities of color it's eighty

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:56.731 region:rollup2
seven point six for African

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:58.166 region:rollup2
Americans and people of African

01:33:56.731 --> 01:34:00.268 region:rollup2
descent.

01:33:58.166 --> 01:34:00.935 region:rollup2
Twenty seven point two for

01:34:00.268 --> 01:34:04.172 region:rollup2
Latinos and twelve point for for

01:34:00.935 --> 01:34:04.672 region:rollup2
white.

01:34:04.172 --> 01:34:06.541 region:rollup2
And when you adjust for

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:08.476 region:rollup2
population without means of over

01:34:06.541 --> 01:34:12.180 region:rollup2
representation in the system and

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:12.747 region:rollup2
last time in school.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:16.050 region:rollup2
And this a scary to me. As a

01:34:12.747 --> 01:34:16.651 region:rollup2
mom.

01:34:16.050 --> 01:34:18.153 region:rollup2
As my brother and because of

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:20.255 region:rollup2
what happened to my brother.

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:20.822 region:rollup2
If you ask my brother and you

01:34:20.255 --> 01:34:22.157 region:rollup2
ask what his health problems

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:24.125 region:rollup2
are.

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:26.127 region:rollup2
He holds all of these

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:26.728 region:rollup2
he's constantly injure the few

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:30.164 region:rollup2
times a year that I see him.

01:34:26.728 --> 01:34:30.331 region:rollup2
He uses drugs to self medicate.

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:32.200 region:rollup2
And.

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:32.800 region:rollup2
.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.469 region:rollup2
There are significant mental

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.204 region:rollup2
health issues that go without

01:34:34.469 --> 01:34:36.738 region:rollup2
treatment.

01:34:36.204 --> 01:34:40.208 region:rollup2
Programs like restorative

01:34:36.738 --> 01:34:40.408 region:rollup2
justice.

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:42.277 region:rollup2
And.

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:44.178 region:rollup2
Early youth development have

01:34:42.277 --> 01:34:46.147 region:rollup2
demonstrated significant

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:48.216 region:rollup2
positive impacts on some of

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:50.351 region:rollup2
these health outcomes.

01:34:48.216 --> 01:34:52.353 region:rollup2
Including making sure that kids

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:54.088 region:rollup2
I go to school and get on

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:56.291 region:rollup2
pathways to career.

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:58.159 region:rollup2
They've also demonstrate and we

01:34:56.291 --> 01:35:00.195 region:rollup2
know this from our own local

01:34:58.159 --> 01:35:00.628 region:rollup2
study in San Diego.

01:35:00.195 --> 01:35:02.363 region:rollup2
That recidivism is

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:02.897 region:rollup2
significantly lower with kids

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.199 region:rollup2
who go through restorative

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:09.137 region:rollup2
programs.

01:35:04.199 --> 01:35:09.737 region:rollup2
So it's twelve percent.

01:35:09.137 --> 01:35:11.439 region:rollup2
Verse says twenty to sixty

01:35:09.737 --> 01:35:13.174 region:rollup2
percent in the traditional

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:15.143 region:rollup2
system.

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.810 region:rollup2
Victim satisfaction es up.

01:35:15.143 --> 01:35:19.147 region:rollup2
And trauma and health outcomes

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:19.414 region:rollup2
increased.

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:21.449 region:rollup2
So again.

01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:25.186 region:rollup2
I think we've done a lot but we

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:27.188 region:rollup2
have a long way to go. And this

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:37.165 region:rollup2
would be my wish list a if

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:39.467 region:rollup2
something were to be done.

01:35:37.165 --> 01:35:39.934 region:rollup2
So I by. That and we may have a

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:41.302 region:rollup2
couple questions but.

01:35:39.934 --> 01:35:43.204 region:rollup2
.

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:45.340 region:rollup2
I just start with.

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:46.007 region:rollup2
So what I need to do to earn one

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:49.210 region:rollup2
of them father to child. Looking

01:35:46.007 --> 01:35:53.214 region:rollup2
shirts.

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:55.383 region:rollup2
Ridiculous go badly.

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:57.385 region:rollup2
I mean of you work for I and I

01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:59.187 region:rollup2
know he has got with how do you

01:35:57.385 --> 01:36:01.189 region:rollup2
become a man of my word.

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:03.992 region:rollup2
And then move on so.

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:06.294 region:rollup2
And I I've graduated to.

01:36:03.992 --> 01:36:08.463 region:rollup2
Examine debt.

01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:08.997 region:rollup2
College money to to that have

01:36:08.463 --> 01:36:10.298 region:rollup2
one on a cliff if a team.

01:36:08.997 --> 01:36:14.335 region:rollup2
.

01:36:10.298 --> 01:36:16.337 region:rollup2
Pray guy gets a cut scholarship.

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:18.339 region:rollup2
But you you you mentioned.

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:20.708 region:rollup2
.

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:22.377 region:rollup2
All poll where Sacramento a lot

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:24.345 region:rollup2
of times and that's why these

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:24.979 region:rollup2
hearings are so important.

01:36:24.345 --> 01:36:25.246 region:rollup2
And that would broadcast it out

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.614 region:rollup2
of the P.

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:28.349 region:rollup2
see it are a lot of times.

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:30.318 region:rollup2
.

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:32.553 region:rollup2
We have colleagues.

01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:33.154 region:rollup2
Unfortunately some of these

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:34.322 region:rollup2
colleagues look like a lot of

01:36:33.154 --> 01:36:34.889 region:rollup2
people lives in this room.

01:36:34.322 --> 01:36:36.190 region:rollup2
That don't really understand

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:38.326 region:rollup2
restorative justice

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:40.328 region:rollup2
Oct Weber and I.

01:36:38.326 --> 01:36:42.630 region:rollup2
We.

01:36:40.328 --> 01:36:44.332 region:rollup2
We get a little frustrated

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.766 region:rollup2
sometimes.

01:36:44.332 --> 01:36:46.367 region:rollup2
One more try this

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:48.469 region:rollup2
supply.

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:50.505 region:rollup2
But forget it other African

01:36:48.469 --> 01:36:50.905 region:rollup2
Americans let you know why this

01:36:50.505 --> 01:36:51.072 region:rollup2
is so important.

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:52.373 region:rollup2
And.

01:36:51.072 --> 01:36:54.375 region:rollup2
.

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:54.709 region:rollup2
And.

01:36:54.375 --> 01:36:56.377 region:rollup2
It out today.

01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:58.379 region:rollup2
.

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.513 region:rollup2
Bob my nephew.

01:36:58.379 --> 01:37:00.381 region:rollup2
.

01:36:58.513 --> 01:37:02.383 region:rollup2
Wasn't court.

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:04.352 region:rollup2
For felony.

01:37:02.383 --> 01:37:06.654 region:rollup2
And and.

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:08.256 region:rollup2
It looks like he won't serve any

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.890 region:rollup2
jail time.

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:10.692 region:rollup2
And it looks so real probation

01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:12.527 region:rollup2
and then at the end of February.

01:37:10.692 --> 01:37:13.094 region:rollup2
Will work real hard to make sure

01:37:12.527 --> 01:37:14.362 region:rollup2
you get that felony office

01:37:13.094 --> 01:37:16.364 region:rollup2
regularly.

01:37:14.362 --> 01:37:18.666 region:rollup2
Drop down to the misdemeanor.

01:37:16.364 --> 01:37:20.401 region:rollup2
Of fortunate son you know how

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:22.637 region:rollup2
important that is.

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:24.272 region:rollup2
And what I tell them. A lot of

01:37:22.637 --> 01:37:24.839 region:rollup2
them is

01:37:24.272 --> 01:37:26.407 region:rollup2
we have these people in our

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:28.309 region:rollup2
families.

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:30.611 region:rollup2
I don't pretend like you don't.

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:31.245 region:rollup2
A lot of people pretend like

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:32.413 region:rollup2
they don't know who these people

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:34.849 region:rollup2
are.

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:36.617 region:rollup2
And where they came from and.

01:37:34.849 --> 01:37:38.386 region:rollup2
And and that they don't

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.753 region:rollup2
understand the challenges that

01:37:38.386 --> 01:37:40.855 region:rollup2
are out there.

01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:41.089 region:rollup2
And so from so if ruling curry

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.423 region:rollup2
James.

01:37:41.089 --> 01:37:44.325 region:rollup2
And so I.

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:48.563 region:rollup2
I kind of wanted.

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:50.431 region:rollup2
Talk about the programs liked it

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:52.467 region:rollup2
and I really met the father did.

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:53.067 region:rollup2
A child could my.

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:54.469 region:rollup2
The one to hear live it more

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:56.571 region:rollup2
because my.

01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:58.473 region:rollup2
My nephew does have a child.

01:37:56.571 --> 01:38:00.575 region:rollup2
Newborn.

01:37:58.473 --> 01:38:01.042 region:rollup2
And I want to make sure he can

01:38:00.575 --> 01:38:02.477 region:rollup2
be a man of his word.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:04.479 region:rollup2
And.

01:38:02.477 --> 01:38:06.581 region:rollup2
Father to child.

01:38:04.479 --> 01:38:08.483 region:rollup2
And I know you said you you

01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:09.050 region:rollup2
started on a shoestring budget.

01:38:08.483 --> 01:38:12.553 region:rollup2
But it sounds like that's

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:13.121 region:rollup2
something we should.

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.455 region:rollup2
Maybe it should to in every

01:38:13.121 --> 01:38:16.591 region:rollup2
city.

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:17.125 region:rollup2
Because is a lot like his

01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:18.559 region:rollup2
problem is it wasn't of.

01:38:17.125 --> 01:38:20.561 region:rollup2
A father.

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:22.497 region:rollup2
In his life.

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:24.599 region:rollup2
But in the home and I can see

01:38:22.497 --> 01:38:26.567 region:rollup2
the ramifications of not.

01:38:24.599 --> 01:38:27.201 region:rollup2
Having a male presence

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:30.605 region:rollup2
we're not even knowing who his

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:31.172 region:rollup2
father is.

01:38:30.605 --> 01:38:32.507 region:rollup2
How that effective so if you

01:38:31.172 --> 01:38:34.609 region:rollup2
could?

01:38:32.507 --> 01:38:36.711 region:rollup2
Maybe going a little bit more.

01:38:34.609 --> 01:38:38.479 region:rollup2
On that program I be happy too

01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:40.515 region:rollup2
I'm the father the child program

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:42.683 region:rollup2
and this really is. An.

01:38:40.515 --> 01:38:44.485 region:rollup2
A small program that was an

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:46.621 region:rollup2
afterthought from one of my.

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:47.255 region:rollup2
My county colleagues who said

01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:48.489 region:rollup2
Daffy they got a little bit a

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:50.491 region:rollup2
pot of money but he going to do.

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:54.595 region:rollup2
And.

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:56.531 region:rollup2
I I really wanted to work with.

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:58.566 region:rollup2
A design something for men and

01:38:56.531 --> 01:39:00.535 region:rollup2
boys that was going to be not

01:38:58.566 --> 01:39:02.703 region:rollup2
just. A parenting program.

01:39:00.535 --> 01:39:04.539 region:rollup2
But it was gonna be a transfer

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:06.841 region:rollup2
formative kind of process.

01:39:04.539 --> 01:39:08.643 region:rollup2
So I did a search of a model.

01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:12.547 region:rollup2
That.

01:39:08.643 --> 01:39:14.749 region:rollup2
Really was working in Baltimore.

01:39:12.547 --> 01:39:16.517 region:rollup2
Help men relate to other men and

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:17.118 region:rollup2
very relational.

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.519 region:rollup2
They have some connection with

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:19.153 region:rollup2
each other.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:20.621 region:rollup2
And through that connection they

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:22.623 region:rollup2
get.

01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:24.625 region:rollup2
Support. Rites of passage.

01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:26.994 region:rollup2
Power to do better.

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:28.629 region:rollup2
And seen for the first time as a

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:29.197 region:rollup2
man.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:31.032 region:rollup2
That's positive among other

01:39:29.197 --> 01:39:32.667 region:rollup2
men's will have had the same

01:39:31.032 --> 01:39:34.969 region:rollup2
experience.

01:39:32.667 --> 01:39:36.671 region:rollup2
And then I hired two gentleman

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:40.641 region:rollup2
Mister Wooten.

01:39:36.671 --> 01:39:41.142 region:rollup2
And Andre Jones and they created

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:42.577 region:rollup2
magic in the workshops.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:44.712 region:rollup2
It was.

01:39:42.577 --> 01:39:46.914 region:rollup2
Phenomenal.

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:48.683 region:rollup2
And if you hear and you speak to

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:49.317 region:rollup2
any of the men up there

01:39:48.683 --> 01:39:50.685 region:rollup2
that's how you what it meant to

01:39:49.317 --> 01:39:51.285 region:rollup2
them.

01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:52.687 region:rollup2
And that now many of them are

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:54.689 region:rollup2
alumni.

01:39:52.687 --> 01:39:56.757 region:rollup2
They have.

01:39:54.689 --> 01:39:57.325 region:rollup2
She had the old ways but the

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:58.693 region:rollup2
children are so important to

01:39:57.325 --> 01:39:59.227 region:rollup2
them.

01:39:58.693 --> 01:40:00.928 region:rollup2
But now the family it's

01:39:59.227 --> 01:40:02.697 region:rollup2
important to them and I'm

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:04.999 region:rollup2
motivates them to do better.

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:07.101 region:rollup2
It motivates them to stay strong

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:09.103 region:rollup2
and motivates them to to do what

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:10.905 region:rollup2
they need to do in the that and

01:40:09.103 --> 01:40:12.740 region:rollup2
the next step and then no

01:40:10.905 --> 01:40:14.709 region:rollup2
judgments there.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.309 region:rollup2
We really but help these men see

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:16.744 region:rollup2
that they are on and they are

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:17.411 region:rollup2
valued.

01:40:16.744 --> 01:40:18.746 region:rollup2
And there are people willing to

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:21.215 region:rollup2
support and help them.

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:22.717 region:rollup2
So through the program we have

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:25.219 region:rollup2
let me target medical.

01:40:22.717 --> 01:40:27.021 region:rollup2
And we have intergenerational

01:40:25.219 --> 01:40:29.023 region:rollup2
groups them have older men who

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:31.125 region:rollup2
grandparents of parenting that

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:33.060 region:rollup2
yeah grandchildren. As well as

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:34.729 region:rollup2
young men will just coming out

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.831 region:rollup2
of institutions.

01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:39.200 region:rollup2
It's been effective.

01:40:36.831 --> 01:40:39.467 region:rollup2
But it's only been a shoestring

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.235 region:rollup2
program.

01:40:39.467 --> 01:40:43.170 region:rollup2
We because we don't look at the

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:44.772 region:rollup2
money will cut the end product

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:46.774 region:rollup2
what is the outcome.

01:40:44.772 --> 01:40:48.910 region:rollup2
With insurance.

01:40:46.774 --> 01:40:49.543 region:rollup2
And I would hope that you will

01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:50.778 region:rollup2
talk to any one of the men with

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:52.780 region:rollup2
the teacher.

01:40:50.778 --> 01:40:53.414 region:rollup2
You're gonna see.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.882 region:rollup2
I I call it the magic that can

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:57.018 region:rollup2
be done.

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:58.819 region:rollup2
And if have to be done in every

01:40:57.018 --> 01:41:01.022 region:rollup2
community every group

01:40:58.819 --> 01:41:02.757 region:rollup2
every ethnicity hasta have that.

01:41:01.022 --> 01:41:05.059 region:rollup2
Component.

01:41:02.757 --> 01:41:06.861 region:rollup2
It would have to be done not not

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:08.863 region:rollup2
not in them what a damn way.

01:41:06.861 --> 01:41:09.463 region:rollup2
S. B..

01:41:08.863 --> 01:41:12.900 region:rollup2
Real these men have to really

01:41:09.463 --> 01:41:14.869 region:rollup2
see that you care they can.

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.503 region:rollup2
To all the nonsense

01:41:14.869 --> 01:41:18.906 region:rollup2
and really value the work that.

01:41:15.503 --> 01:41:20.942 region:rollup2
You're trying to do with them.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:22.944 region:rollup2
And so. I want father chop of

01:41:20.942 --> 01:41:24.879 region:rollup2
memory. I would really want to

01:41:22.944 --> 01:41:25.546 region:rollup2
make a difference for these men

01:41:24.879 --> 01:41:27.281 region:rollup2
for the first time everywhere.

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:30.918 region:rollup2
Innocent eagle we are making a

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:31.619 region:rollup2
difference but. It isn't easy.

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:34.922 region:rollup2
Because we'd Mister a shoestring

01:41:31.619 --> 01:41:35.489 region:rollup2
budget but.

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:36.824 region:rollup2
We got will look into match

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.358 region:rollup2
again.

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.926 region:rollup2
We can make things happen

01:41:37.358 --> 01:41:39.560 region:rollup2
anyway.

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.128 region:rollup2
And that's really the value of

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:43.230 region:rollup2
the program and we're going to

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:43.464 region:rollup2
try to Estado. Girls and women's

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:46.934 region:rollup2
program

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:48.970 region:rollup2
focusing on them their unique

01:41:46.934 --> 01:41:49.637 region:rollup2
needs a very different from.

01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:50.972 region:rollup2
And they have to be delivered in

01:41:49.637 --> 01:41:55.042 region:rollup2
a very different manner.

01:41:50.972 --> 01:41:57.311 region:rollup2
So. I'm excited and hopeful. I'm

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:58.879 region:rollup2
certainly with you sitting next

01:41:57.311 --> 01:42:00.982 region:rollup2
to me.

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:02.850 region:rollup2
That we could make them.

01:42:00.982 --> 01:42:06.954 region:rollup2
Thank you.

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:08.923 region:rollup2
Roughly how many minutes.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:09.490 region:rollup2
We serve the with a seven

01:42:08.923 --> 01:42:10.958 region:rollup2
hundred meniscal of of what

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:13.227 region:rollup2
time.

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:15.096 region:rollup2
Three years three three years

01:42:13.227 --> 01:42:16.864 region:rollup2
about seven hundred. And your

01:42:15.096 --> 01:42:18.966 region:rollup2
goal is to reach a mini.

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:19.567 region:rollup2
Well executed gave me a first

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:23.004 region:rollup2
goal was only seventy five a

01:42:19.567 --> 01:42:23.371 region:rollup2
year. Leave exceed that by.

01:42:23.004 --> 01:42:25.439 region:rollup2
Leaps and bounds

01:42:23.371 --> 01:42:28.909 region:rollup2
so my got my goal would be the

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:31.045 region:rollup2
six about two hundred men.

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:31.646 region:rollup2
Of color at me for the next

01:42:31.045 --> 01:42:32.913 region:rollup2
whatever number yes we can do

01:42:31.646 --> 01:42:35.282 region:rollup2
this.

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:35.950 region:rollup2
Because it this a level of

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.451 region:rollup2
intimacy Evan in the groups we

01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:39.353 region:rollup2
don't have a large groups of men

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:41.155 region:rollup2
so they can really relate we

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:41.689 region:rollup2
share with each other may have a

01:42:41.155 --> 01:42:42.990 region:rollup2
curriculum that is really

01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:43.290 region:rollup2
designed.

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.292 region:rollup2
To really.

01:42:43.290 --> 01:42:47.294 region:rollup2
Empower them and motivate them

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:49.296 region:rollup2
to share with each other and

01:42:47.294 --> 01:42:51.165 region:rollup2
also speak about those things

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:52.900 region:rollup2
that were secret. That they

01:42:51.165 --> 01:42:53.567 region:rollup2
wouldn't share with other people

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.302 region:rollup2
now they can see it with a group

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:57.038 region:rollup2
of men who have the same

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:57.705 region:rollup2
experience they have.

01:42:57.038 --> 01:42:59.306 region:rollup2
So it really opens them up to

01:42:57.705 --> 01:43:01.375 region:rollup2
really understanding how they

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:03.210 region:rollup2
can improve. That's why we don't

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:05.046 region:rollup2
have any of them any females

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:05.613 region:rollup2
teaching the class.

01:43:05.046 --> 01:43:07.048 region:rollup2
You have meant teaching the

01:43:05.613 --> 01:43:09.216 region:rollup2
class.

01:43:07.048 --> 01:43:10.918 region:rollup2
We also have men who and who

01:43:09.216 --> 01:43:13.320 region:rollup2
have been in their shoes.

01:43:10.918 --> 01:43:15.289 region:rollup2
Some of our trainers have had.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.489 region:rollup2
Aye been incarcerated them

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:18.993 region:rollup2
sounds

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:21.095 region:rollup2
and how it can cheer. You also

01:43:18.993 --> 01:43:23.030 region:rollup2
have it. Out gentlemanly Kiley

01:43:21.095 --> 01:43:25.232 region:rollup2
from the county was a bale of.

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.800 region:rollup2
Came to the program so he sees

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:29.070 region:rollup2
it from a different vantage

01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:31.072 region:rollup2
and brings that. To the group.

01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:33.274 region:rollup2
So it really does work.

01:43:31.072 --> 01:43:35.443 region:rollup2
And we have an opportunity to

01:43:33.274 --> 01:43:39.113 region:rollup2
grow the programming and looking

01:43:35.443 --> 01:43:39.713 region:rollup2
forward to hopefully do.

01:43:39.113 --> 01:43:41.115 region:rollup2
So what is your budget for the

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:43.350 region:rollup2
program.

01:43:41.115 --> 01:43:53.094 region:rollup2
We started off a fifty thousand.

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:55.563 region:rollup2
To fifty.

01:43:53.094 --> 01:43:57.064 region:rollup2
No it's not a lot of money yeah

01:43:55.563 --> 01:43:57.398 region:rollup2
I was asking that I mean

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:59.133 region:rollup2
no I chair the

01:43:57.398 --> 01:44:03.137 region:rollup2
budget.

01:43:59.133 --> 01:44:03.804 region:rollup2
Public safety so these issues.

01:44:03.137 --> 01:44:05.106 region:rollup2
So it would be helpful if there.

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:05.739 region:rollup2
Polls of state

01:44:05.106 --> 01:44:07.007 region:rollup2
forward because we do have the

01:44:05.739 --> 01:44:09.143 region:rollup2
ability to

01:44:07.007 --> 01:44:11.178 region:rollup2
fun things in this is a.

01:44:09.143 --> 01:44:13.280 region:rollup2
Obviously and an important

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:15.349 region:rollup2
project that gets beyond us just

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:16.016 region:rollup2
giving money to the county and

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:17.418 region:rollup2
then they figured out what they

01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:19.120 region:rollup2
want to do it. I've been kind of

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:21.122 region:rollup2
opposed to that.

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:25.259 region:rollup2
I'm more into of.

01:44:21.122 --> 01:44:25.926 region:rollup2
Nnova of the never seems the

01:44:25.259 --> 01:44:27.394 region:rollup2
trickle down in a fast enough

01:44:25.926 --> 01:44:30.998 region:rollup2
great more in any significant

01:44:27.394 --> 01:44:31.499 region:rollup2
amount of. So I'm more into

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:33.567 region:rollup2
finding things at work.

01:44:31.499 --> 01:44:35.469 region:rollup2
And helping those things to grow

01:44:33.567 --> 01:44:37.571 region:rollup2
because in that gives as a great

01:44:35.469 --> 01:44:39.507 region:rollup2
a dividend coming back to the

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:41.509 region:rollup2
state. With regards to it and I

01:44:39.507 --> 01:44:43.210 region:rollup2
think we are very interested in

01:44:41.509 --> 01:44:43.844 region:rollup2
I've seen. I've read many of

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:45.279 region:rollup2
these programs that the state's

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:47.214 region:rollup2
main in Pennsylvania

01:44:45.279 --> 01:44:47.915 region:rollup2
Philadelphia somewhere and they

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:48.516 region:rollup2
really are good programs that do

01:44:47.915 --> 01:44:51.051 region:rollup2
work. And and I think we need

01:44:48.516 --> 01:44:51.452 region:rollup2
to.

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:53.053 region:rollup2
We're looking at.

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:55.055 region:rollup2
.

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:55.689 region:rollup2
At the state level.

01:44:55.055 --> 01:44:59.059 region:rollup2
A lot of trying to figure out

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:59.660 region:rollup2
how we prevent recidivism.

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:01.061 region:rollup2
So the folks who have been

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.564 region:rollup2
incarcerated don't go back.

01:45:01.061 --> 01:45:05.299 region:rollup2
And part of it is the connection

01:45:03.564 --> 01:45:05.866 region:rollup2
in the commitment they have to

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:07.101 region:rollup2
the families that they left

01:45:05.866 --> 01:45:09.136 region:rollup2
behind.

01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:09.737 region:rollup2
And figure out how to relate to

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:11.338 region:rollup2
them because of that at some

01:45:09.737 --> 01:45:13.107 region:rollup2
meaning to their existence

01:45:11.338 --> 01:45:13.374 region:rollup2
outside of the institution.

01:45:13.107 --> 01:45:15.543 region:rollup2
And so.

01:45:13.374 --> 01:45:17.344 region:rollup2
Our governors committed to

01:45:15.543 --> 01:45:19.413 region:rollup2
trying to figure out things of

01:45:17.344 --> 01:45:21.081 region:rollup2
programs and and I am to at that

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:23.150 region:rollup2
point committed to making sure

01:45:21.081 --> 01:45:25.252 region:rollup2
that that. Dollars we put into

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:27.221 region:rollup2
communities actually address the

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:29.190 region:rollup2
issues that a bear and a higher

01:45:27.221 --> 01:45:31.058 region:rollup2
positive effectively so I'd be

01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:33.160 region:rollup2
interested in seeing what you're

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:35.062 region:rollup2
proposal looks like. In the next

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.729 region:rollup2
hopefully the next week or so us

01:45:35.062 --> 01:45:39.333 region:rollup2
sending it to my office because

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:41.168 region:rollup2
we are in the midst of creating

01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:43.170 region:rollup2
a new budget for this year.

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:43.771 region:rollup2
I just want to watch it with.

01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.272 region:rollup2
I would I was talking to the

01:45:43.771 --> 01:45:47.308 region:rollup2
chief probation officer in San

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:47.942 region:rollup2
Diego and he was saying how they

01:45:47.308 --> 01:45:49.276 region:rollup2
have to multiple problems. One

01:45:47.942 --> 01:45:51.545 region:rollup2
young man was.

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:53.180 region:rollup2
Hip and has been in and out of

01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:55.149 region:rollup2
prison he finally got.

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.117 region:rollup2
Really acclimated to the

01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:57.685 region:rollup2
programs with in the prison and

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:59.153 region:rollup2
given the home. But he was

01:45:57.685 --> 01:46:01.121 region:rollup2
afraid to go home.

01:45:59.153 --> 01:46:03.157 region:rollup2
Because his home environment

01:46:01.121 --> 01:46:05.593 region:rollup2
was the same as when he left.

01:46:03.157 --> 01:46:09.129 region:rollup2
So they're keeping this young

01:46:05.593 --> 01:46:09.630 region:rollup2
man inside because he. He really

01:46:09.129 --> 01:46:13.200 region:rollup2
sees he feels Cup more

01:46:09.630 --> 01:46:15.202 region:rollup2
comfortable living I don't.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.238 region:rollup2
Not because he needed to be.

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:19.173 region:rollup2
Find any longer but the

01:46:17.238 --> 01:46:21.208 region:rollup2
environment in homeless not

01:46:19.173 --> 01:46:23.377 region:rollup2
brown so we really gotta do.

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:25.512 region:rollup2
Different types of work that

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:26.080 region:rollup2
really strengthens. And allows

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:29.316 region:rollup2
these young men and women.

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:29.783 region:rollup2
Even.

01:46:29.316 --> 01:46:35.289 region:rollup2
Succeed even at in the

01:46:29.783 --> 01:46:37.625 region:rollup2
communities that.

01:46:35.289 --> 01:46:38.225 region:rollup2
So. For the group said

01:46:37.625 --> 01:46:39.293 region:rollup2
edification that just like to

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:41.562 region:rollup2
say that.

01:46:39.293 --> 01:46:42.196 region:rollup2
You know I I think there are a

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:43.297 region:rollup2
lot of these answers are in the

01:46:42.196 --> 01:46:45.666 region:rollup2
room.

01:46:43.297 --> 01:46:47.534 region:rollup2
So by the people there here in

01:46:45.666 --> 01:46:49.336 region:rollup2
the panel and and speaking in

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:51.472 region:rollup2
everything but.

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:53.440 region:rollup2
Before we close I just have to

01:46:51.472 --> 01:46:55.209 region:rollup2
say you know Kate can we. Try to

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.344 region:rollup2
focus a little bit more on

01:46:55.209 --> 01:46:59.480 region:rollup2
leadership development.

01:46:57.344 --> 01:47:01.348 region:rollup2
And getting back to what we use

01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:03.183 region:rollup2
it in.

01:47:01.348 --> 01:47:05.319 region:rollup2
Which is we used to teach each

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.886 region:rollup2
other everything that we know.

01:47:05.319 --> 01:47:07.321 region:rollup2
And share the information.

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:09.757 region:rollup2
Everything.

01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:11.592 region:rollup2
And and that's why I offer you

01:47:09.757 --> 01:47:13.427 region:rollup2
the program that was talking

01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:13.894 region:rollup2
about because that was twenty

01:47:13.427 --> 01:47:15.329 region:rollup2
two years of public of

01:47:13.894 --> 01:47:15.529 region:rollup2
knowledge.

01:47:15.329 --> 01:47:17.665 region:rollup2
Them.

01:47:15.529 --> 01:47:19.733 region:rollup2
Altruistic plea. Passing down

01:47:17.665 --> 01:47:21.468 region:rollup2

Place of healing and growth.

01:47:25.739 --> 01:47:29.777 region:rollup2
And and and and that's what

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:31.378 region:rollup2

capacity folks

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:35.316 region:rollup2
so that they can navigate the

01:47:33.447 --> 01:47:35.916 region:rollup2
systems and take this knowledge.

01:47:35.316 --> 01:47:37.384 region:rollup2
And and make a good life for

01:47:35.916 --> 01:47:39.386 region:rollup2
themselves.

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:41.288 region:rollup2
.

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:43.390 region:rollup2

01:47:41.288 --> 01:47:45.659 region:rollup2

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.744 region:rollup2
After I got out at UC riverside.

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:05.679 region:rollup2
I've had several conversations

01:48:03.744 --> 01:48:07.514 region:rollup2
with the man at the county that

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:11.418 region:rollup2

01:52:58.372 --> 01:53:01.708 region:rollup2
I am part of the first quarter

man death went through

01:53:01.708 --> 01:53:05.746 region:rollup2
the program.

01:53:03.744 --> 01:53:07.714 region:rollup2
And when I was.

01:53:05.746 --> 01:53:08.348 region:rollup2

01:53:09.850 --> 01:53:11.718 region:rollup2
well I did a pretty good job so.

01:53:10.484 --> 01:53:14.855 region:rollup2
But also in the.

01:53:11.718 --> 01:53:15.455 region:rollup2
And I've learned so much from

01:53:14.855 --> 01:53:16.523 region:rollup2
that program that even though

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:18.525 region:rollup2
it's been.

01:53:16.523 --> 01:53:20.827 region:rollup2
Off wouldn't.

01:53:18.525 --> 01:53:21.461 region:rollup2
Daffy gimmicks you say three

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:22.629 region:rollup2
years but I think it's more like

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:26.667 region:rollup2
five years.

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:28.702 region:rollup2
Okay and so it's been such are.

01:53:26.667 --> 01:53:29.336 region:rollup2
Schools of education and

01:53:28.702 --> 01:53:32.439 region:rollup2
inspiration from me that even

01:53:29.336 --> 01:53:32.839 region:rollup2
though it's been many years I

01:53:32.439 --> 01:53:35.108 region:rollup2
still come back.

01:53:32.839 --> 01:53:35.742 region:rollup2

01:53:35.108 --> 01:53:36.777 region:rollup2
through the program the continue

01:53:35.742 --> 01:53:37.377 region:rollup2
to come.

01:53:36.777 --> 01:53:38.779 region:rollup2
And you could just tell by who

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:40.981 region:rollup2
is here.

01:53:38.779 --> 01:53:42.883 region:rollup2
And this gentleman here.

01:53:40.981 --> 01:53:44.851 region:rollup2
He can get to people.

01:53:42.883 --> 01:53:52.959 region:rollup2
Most people cannot get to.

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:53.527 region:rollup2
It wouldn't please stand.

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:54.861 region:rollup2
Some of the men will be took

01:53:53.527 --> 01:53:58.932 region:rollup2
program.

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:59.599 region:rollup2
Leave had some tough life.

01:53:58.932 --> 01:54:01.435 region:rollup2

and. And works very hard to make

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:09.836 region:rollup2
things happen and it is

01:55:07.901 --> 01:55:11.605 region:rollup2
imperative that we do take

01:55:09.836 --> 01:55:12.239 region:rollup2
charge.

01:55:11.605 --> 01:55:13.940 region:rollup2
You know that we do take charge

01:55:12.239 --> 01:55:15.776 region:rollup2

listen to the young man talk

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:23.650 region:rollup2
about all full to help him.

01:55:21.715 --> 01:55:24.284 region:rollup2
On the summit all the leaders in

public health I mean you've met

01:55:25.986 --> 01:55:29.890 region:rollup2
of all.

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:31.825 region:rollup2
Tucker was to Sam's although the

01:55:29.890 --> 01:55:33.760 region:rollup2
friends of ours who for years

01:55:31.825 --> 01:55:35.629 region:rollup2
and of course us he's a step is

01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:36.296 region:rollup2
here who has always been. A

01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:38.098 region:rollup2
pioneer in the theory of social

01:55:36.296 --> 01:55:40.100 region:rollup2
service and public and probation

01:55:38.098 --> 01:55:42.002 region:rollup2
here in San Diego so it's good

01:55:40.100 --> 01:55:43.737 region:rollup2
to know that. These folks are

01:55:42.002 --> 01:55:44.371 region:rollup2
still around and that they're

01:55:43.737 --> 01:55:45.739 region:rollup2
able to help you may have always

01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:46.373 region:rollup2
done.

01:55:45.739 --> 01:55:48.108 region:rollup2
And we just have to make sure

01:55:46.373 --> 01:55:49.643 region:rollup2
that as they retire that we feel

01:55:48.108 --> 01:55:51.912 region:rollup2
there possess.

01:55:49.643 --> 01:55:55.649 region:rollup2
Individuals like that policy was

01:55:51.912 --> 01:55:56.249 region:rollup2
ill now and rebuilding himself

01:55:55.649 --> 01:55:56.883 region:rollup2
whose wife is still strong

01:55:56.249 --> 01:55:57.651 region:rollup2
health advocate in San Diego he

01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:59.920 region:rollup2
is to.

01:55:57.651 --> 01:56:00.487 region:rollup2
And we also rely upon call

01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:01.955 region:rollup2
floats in good guidance and

01:56:00.487 --> 01:56:03.957 region:rollup2
information and help.

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:05.992 region:rollup2
So I just I just hope that we

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:07.661 region:rollup2
look at those positions women

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:08.295 region:rollup2
there.

01:56:07.661 --> 01:56:09.996 region:rollup2
And make sure that if some of

01:56:08.295 --> 01:56:11.832 region:rollup2
them are retiring I don't know.

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:13.967 region:rollup2
If heroes retired took care

01:56:11.832 --> 01:56:15.802 region:rollup2
Eggman scheduled to you did we

01:56:13.967 --> 01:56:17.704 region:rollup2
tied us up on he. He's a

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:20.040 region:rollup2
longtime friend in his wife and.

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:21.675 region:rollup2
Family and good friends of mine

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.342 region:rollup2
and I knew whose both retired

01:56:21.675 --> 01:56:23.677 region:rollup2
and so you would when you start

01:56:22.342 --> 01:56:24.344 region:rollup2
talking about that then you have

01:56:23.677 --> 01:56:25.712 region:rollup2
to make sure that we try to fill

01:56:24.344 --> 01:56:26.346 region:rollup2
those slots.

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:28.181 region:rollup2
That we make sure their people

01:56:26.346 --> 01:56:30.150 region:rollup2

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:31.685 region:rollup2

01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:32.252 region:rollup2
supposed to do for the county.

01:56:31.685 --> 01:56:34.054 region:rollup2
But understand that their

01:56:32.252 --> 01:56:35.755 region:rollup2
responsibility goes far beyond

01:56:34.054 --> 01:56:38.024 region:rollup2
the definition of that job

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:38.658 region:rollup2

01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:41.888 region:rollup2
And I'm committed to taking my

01:57:40.153 --> 01:57:43.757 region:rollup2
position.

01:57:41.888 --> 01:57:44.424 region:rollup2
